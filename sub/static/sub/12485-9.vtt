00:18.789 --> 00:21.792
There are only
like 20 of these
left in the whole world.

00:21.792 --> 00:23.794
Do you know
how cool this is?

00:23.794 --> 00:26.597
Not as cool as going
to the old-timey
photo booth

00:26.597 --> 00:28.699
and mocking the costumes
for historical inaccuracies.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.735
Oh!

00:34.735 --> 00:37.738
This guitar's
only 500 bucks.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.610
I have to make sure
no one else buys it

00:39.610 --> 00:41.041
until I figure out
how to get the money.

And you're all suspects!

00:56.757 --> 00:58.689
There.

01:01.732 --> 01:04.665
Now, once I get 500 bucks,

01:04.665 --> 01:08.569
I can come back and take
this baby home with me.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.800
Uh, Chyna?

01:09.800 --> 01:11.672

(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

02:26.677 --> 02:30.751
Okay.
I agree that was
a little unreasonable.

02:30.751 --> 02:33.524
Just make it $500
and I will have
learned my lesson.

02:35.526 --> 02:36.657
Hello there,
little lady.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.460

02:39.460 --> 02:41.662

02:41.662 --> 02:43.464
but half the potato.

of thing that...

03:14.725 --> 03:15.796

03:17.798 --> 03:21.502

have an aftertaste.

03:21.502 --> 03:22.773
Yes! Friendly Brand

03:22.773 --> 03:25.576
The after-tastiest

03:26.577 --> 03:29.640
No. Chyna,
you're not signing up!

03:29.640 --> 03:31.512
I need this prize money!

03:31.512 --> 03:33.714
Why? Your dad
gave you a credit card.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.617
Yes, to use
for emergencies.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.520
So I bought 20 pairs
of Emergencies.

03:39.520 --> 03:39.550

03:44.525 --> 03:46.797
Now my dad's

Well, I need
the money, too!

03:48.759 --> 03:50.661
I'm trying
to buy a guitar
that looks like...

03:51.802 --> 03:52.603
Well, that little girl.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.607
So give me that pen.
I'm signing up.

03:56.607 --> 03:58.609
No!
 Give me!

03:58.609 --> 04:00.611
Ladies, you need
at least three people
on a team.

04:00.611 --> 04:02.573
Because friendship is about
hanging with your buds.

04:02.573 --> 04:06.717
And Friendly Brand
Lo-Tato Chips are
about your taste buds.

04:06.717 --> 04:08.619
Well, your after taste buds.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
Fine, then I'll just get

is even worse!

04:20.791 --> 04:23.594
That sideshow
was such a rip-off!

04:23.594 --> 04:24.735
The human pretzel
was just a guy

04:24.735 --> 04:26.737
sitting cross-legged,
covered in salt.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.740
Oh, that's
Duncan the Dragon!

04:29.740 --> 04:31.842
I should get
a picture for my cousin.

04:31.842 --> 04:34.745
He collects pictures of
guys with lousy jobs.

04:36.747 --> 04:39.650
You want a hug
from Duncan, little boy?

04:39.650 --> 04:42.583
It's for my cousin.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.614
Whatever.
Duncan doesn't judge.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.818
(SHUTTER CLICKS)

04:49.860 --> 04:53.894

move onto something
not dumb and childish?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.796
Ooh! Dinosaur balloons!

05:01.732 --> 05:03.804
Wait a minute,
where's my wallet?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.807
I had it a second ago,
before I hugged...

05:07.878 --> 05:11.742
Duncan the Dragon
stole my wallet!

05:11.742 --> 05:16.747
You can't just
accuse a major celebrity
like that of pick-pocketing.

05:16.747 --> 05:19.750
Maybe someone from
that rip-off sideshow
saw him steal it.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.652
Like the bearded man
or the one-headed lady.

05:25.856 --> 05:27.658
Is that a zipper?

05:27.658 --> 05:29.830
It's common knowledge

05:29.830 --> 05:32.863
that Gideon Sundback didn't
invent the zipper until 1917.

05:37.768 --> 05:38.869
Olive!

05:38.869 --> 05:41.942
How would you like
to spend the day
singing, dancing,

05:41.942 --> 05:45.746
and saluting friendship?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.778
Well, I am
an excellent dancer.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.856
Would you be on my
Salute to Friendship team?

05:55.856 --> 05:58.659
Forget it, Lexi.
She's my friend.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.931
She's just as much
my friend as she is
your friend.

06:00.931 --> 06:01.732
Tell her, Octavia.

06:04.895 --> 06:08.769
We'll just have to
settle this with a game of
France France Revolution!

06:08.769 --> 06:10.841
"France"?
You mean "dance"?

06:11.802 --> 06:13.974
Nope.

06:13.974 --> 06:16.707

are French peasants.

Marie Antoinette.

in her mouth wins the game!

06:25.956 --> 06:28.759

Let them eat cake!

06:42.773 --> 06:44.835
Ha! In your face!

06:47.778 --> 06:49.840
No. Actually, in your face.

06:50.711 --> 06:51.842
I choose Chyna's team.

06:51.842 --> 06:54.785
I just wanted a chance
to throw cake at you.

06:55.846 --> 06:57.788

kidding me!

No! Be on my team!

07:06.797 --> 07:09.730
I don't know
who to choose.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.732
Oh! I have an idea!

07:11.732 --> 07:13.734
I'm thinking
of a number.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.805
Five?

07:14.805 --> 07:15.936
Nope.
 Zucchini?

07:15.936 --> 07:19.810
Correct.
The number was zucchini.

07:27.978 --> 07:30.821
Huh? Hey!

07:33.754 --> 07:34.885
He doesn't have
my wallet on him.

07:34.885 --> 07:35.986
He must have stashed it.

07:35.986 --> 07:38.028
Here's the plan.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.990
Let's catch him
in the act of
stealing your wallet.

07:39.990 --> 07:41.862
What?

07:41.862 --> 07:42.863
I'm not going to
let him steal my wallet.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.835
That's where
I keep my fake ID.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.800
This has your
correct age on it.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.042
I know,
but it says I'm 6'4".

07:53.774 --> 07:55.776
Just hug him.

07:56.977 --> 07:59.009
How old are you,
little boy?

07:59.009 --> 08:00.811
Uh, 6'4".

08:04.855 --> 08:06.056
There you go.

08:07.858 --> 08:08.789
He didn't take it.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.921
Oh, he's good.

08:10.921 --> 08:14.094
This time,
plant the wallet on him

08:14.094 --> 08:15.996
and we'll follow him
to where he stashes it.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.968
Again?

08:17.968 --> 08:19.900
People are gonna
look at me funny.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.001
They already
look at you funny.

If I agree
to be on your team,

09:00.871 --> 09:02.142
will you give me
half the prize money?

09:02.142 --> 09:04.875
Well, I guess
I'd still have
enough for the guitar.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.849
Okay.
 Wait!

09:08.849 --> 09:11.021
How can he get half
if there's three of us?

09:11.021 --> 09:12.923
Because you get nothing.

09:12.923 --> 09:14.855
Oh. Okay.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.988
I was worried
your calculations weren't
mathematically sound.

12:23.043 --> 12:23.073
Uh-oh!

12:39.129 --> 12:40.090
BOTH: Sorry!

12:47.037 --> 12:47.097
I think we're
gaining on him!

12:54.244 --> 12:55.105
That ride
made me dizzy.

12:57.207 --> 12:58.248
There he is! Let's get him!
 Huh?

12:58.248 --> 13:00.180
Gotta go!

13:02.212 --> 13:03.153
Look out!
Coming through!

13:06.086 --> 13:06.116
BOTH: Sorry!

13:11.221 --> 13:14.124
What?

13:14.124 --> 13:15.195
Someone bought my guitar

13:15.195 --> 13:18.328
and took it
on the Ferris wheel!

13:18.328 --> 13:19.329
That's the kid again.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.204
What took you so long?

13:24.204 --> 13:26.176
I thought you were
going to the bathroom.

13:27.077 --> 13:28.378
Um...

13:28.378 --> 13:30.140
I can only go at home.

13:32.242 --> 13:35.285
Angus, there you are!
We need to rehearse!

13:35.285 --> 13:37.147
Rehearse?

13:37.147 --> 13:38.148
We haven't
even hearsed yet.

13:41.091 --> 13:43.093
Wait a second.

13:43.093 --> 13:44.324
You're on
Lexi's team, too?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.157
Uh...
 You're on
Chyna's team, too?

13:47.157 --> 13:48.198
Uh...

13:50.130 --> 13:51.331
I call Angus!
He's mine!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.103
No way!
He's mine!

13:56.166 --> 13:57.167
(BOTH SCREAMING)

13:58.408 --> 14:02.112
Don't worry.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.273
Those are just
my fake arms I wear

14:03.273 --> 14:06.176
in case girls
fight over me.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.148
This is the first time
I've actually had
to use them.

14:09.279 --> 14:11.121
(BONES CRACKING)
 (SCREAMING)

14:12.122 --> 14:14.384
I threw out my back!

14:16.426 --> 14:19.189
Angus, are you
going to be okay?

14:19.189 --> 14:21.391
Yeah, but I don't
think I'm going to
be able to dance.

14:26.336 --> 14:27.197
But we need
three or more
people to compete.

14:29.139 --> 14:29.399
Lexi,

14:29.399 --> 14:32.402
I hate to say it

14:32.402 --> 14:34.304
but there's an obvious
solution to this problem.

14:35.245 --> 14:37.207
You're right.

14:37.207 --> 14:39.249
Get over here, Odetta.
You're on my team.

14:40.350 --> 14:42.152
No!

14:42.212 --> 14:45.215
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

14:45.215 --> 14:46.416
but I think you and I

14:46.416 --> 14:48.418
should team up.

14:48.418 --> 14:49.159
That's a great idea.

14:51.361 --> 14:53.293
And after that,
we can skip
through a meadow,

14:53.293 --> 14:55.325
holding hands,
farting rainbows.

14:58.428 --> 15:00.400
Did you try those
Lo-Tato Chips, too?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.237
Come on, Lexi.

15:07.237 --> 15:09.309
I don't want to do this
any more than you do.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.411
No, I don't want to do this
any more than you do.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.243
Wow, you are
really competitive.

15:15.385 --> 15:18.388
Come on, we both
need the money,

15:18.388 --> 15:20.390
and together
we'll be unbeatable.

15:20.390 --> 15:25.355
You're right.
With my looks
and my talent

15:25.355 --> 15:27.297
and you fulfilling
the requirement of having
three or more people,

15:29.229 --> 15:30.330
we'll be sure to win.

15:32.302 --> 15:35.465
Whatever.
The point is we'll
split the prize.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.207
What about
me and Paisley?

15:37.207 --> 15:39.239
Don't we get
part of the prize?

15:39.239 --> 15:41.471
Seriously, Olive,
it's a salute to
friendship, not greed.

15:53.323 --> 15:57.487
Okay, I think
working together is
going to be really good.

15:57.487 --> 15:58.528
Here's my song.

15:58.528 --> 15:59.559
Thank you.

16:03.463 --> 16:04.434
What are you doing?

16:05.395 --> 16:06.366
My song is way better.

16:08.398 --> 16:09.539
Thank you.

16:13.443 --> 16:15.305
Okay, that was rude.
I didn't even read it.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.583
You joined my team.
We're doing my song!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.585
I didn't join your team.
You joined my team!

16:27.387 --> 16:27.587
You know what?
Forget it.

16:27.587 --> 16:30.490
No guitar is worth
putting up with you.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.492
And no credit card is
worth putting up with you!

16:32.492 --> 16:34.324
I'll just pass my debt
on to my children!

16:34.324 --> 16:36.366
Like a true American!

16:42.402 --> 16:44.574
Every time I come
to this carnival,

16:44.574 --> 16:47.337
I get puked on.

16:47.337 --> 16:48.538
Why did I buy
a season pass?

16:50.610 --> 16:52.412
I think we lost him.

16:53.483 --> 16:55.345
He must've gone
through this door.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.489
What are you doing?
It says, "Do not enter."

16:59.489 --> 17:00.620
I'm not going in there.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.454
(MARKER SQUEAKING)

17:08.528 --> 17:10.430
Ooh! Donut center?
Let's go in there!

17:12.561 --> 17:15.565
(HUMMING)

17:15.565 --> 17:16.566
Wait, get him!

17:17.467 --> 17:18.438
Oh!

17:20.569 --> 17:22.442
Got you,
you stupid dragon!

17:22.442 --> 17:23.512
This will teach you
to steal my wallet.

17:23.512 --> 17:26.516
(GRUNTS)
 And the last donut!

17:28.548 --> 17:29.649
(CHILDREN CRYING)

17:32.382 --> 17:34.524
Don't worry, kids.
He's a bad dragon.

17:34.524 --> 17:37.627
He's a lying,
no-good thief!

17:39.429 --> 17:42.462
Okay, no, really!

17:42.462 --> 17:44.694
He reached
into my pocket
and he pulled out my...

17:47.667 --> 17:49.439
(CHUCKLES) Huh.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.502
I guess I had
my wallet all along.

17:53.503 --> 17:55.605
Sorry, Duncan.

17:55.605 --> 17:58.678
Don't worry,
boys and girls.
Duncan's okay.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.580
We were
just play fighting.

18:00.580 --> 18:01.611
Like this.

18:05.415 --> 18:05.485
(ALL LAUGHING)

18:12.462 --> 18:15.725
Look, Chyna,
if this guitar is
so important to you,

18:15.725 --> 18:18.498
then why don't you
just do Lexi's song?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.699
Besides, you always
beat her at everything.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.631
Give her a chance to shine.

18:21.631 --> 18:23.473
I guess.

18:23.473 --> 18:25.475
Because I would
do anything

18:25.475 --> 18:27.507
to grab this thing
by the neck

18:27.507 --> 18:28.638
and take it home with me.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.510
That's the girl again.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.448
Sorry.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.625
I can't believe
my dad is mad at me

18:45.625 --> 18:47.597
for buying these
Emergency Jeans.

18:47.597 --> 18:48.528
They make me
look so tall.

18:52.462 --> 18:54.534
Maybe you should
just do Chyna's song.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.466
You can be
the bigger person.

18:56.466 --> 18:57.507
