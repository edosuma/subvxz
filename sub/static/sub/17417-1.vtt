NARRATOR: <i>Shortly before
the start of World War II,</i>

00:05.355 --> 00:08.559
<i>the German High Command
began a secret investigation</i>

00:08.659 --> 00:10.761
<i>into the powers of the supernatural.</i>

00:10.861 --> 00:16.433
<i>Ancient legend told of a race of warriors
who used neither weapons nor shields</i>

00:16.533 --> 00:20.646
<i>and whose superhuman power
came from within the earth itself.</i>

00:21.146 --> 00:26.193
<i>As Germany prepared for war, the SS
secretly enlisted a group of scientists</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:28.946
<i>to create an invincible soldier.</i>

00:29.546 --> 00:32.783
<i>It is known that the bodies
of soldiers killed in battle</i>

00:32.883 --> 00:35.869
<i>were returned to a secret
laboratory near Coblenz,</i>

00:35.969 --> 00:40.040
<i>where they were used in a
variety of scientific experiments.</i>

00:40.140 --> 00:42.793
<i>It was rumored that
toward the end of the war</i>

00:42.893 --> 00:47.047
<i>Allied forces met German squads
that fought without weapons,</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:49.550
<i>killing only with their bare hands.</i>

00:50.050 --> 00:53.137
<i>No one knows who they were
or what became of them,</i>

00:53.237 --> 00:57.303
<i>but one thing is certain,
of all the SS units,</i>

00:57.404 --> 01:03.212
<i>there was only one that the Allies
never captured a single member of.</i>

01:06.959 --> 01:10.036
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

02:53.148 --> 02:56.642
ROSE: I don't know how long that dinghy
floated around with me lying in it.

02:57.486 --> 03:02.189
All I can remember is the sound of
the water slapping against the side.

03:03.158 --> 03:06.687
Then I heard the engine
sound getting closer.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.731
That was when I realized
I was still alive.

03:09.831 --> 03:12.658
Get yourself down in there
and help me get her out.

03:17.297 --> 03:19.074
Hey, hey, don't do that.

03:19.174 --> 03:21.500
He's trying to help you!

03:23.720 --> 03:26.164
ROSE: I couldn't understand
what they wanted.

03:26.264 --> 03:28.876
It didn't occur to me
I was being rescued.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.211
It's okay, it's okay,
we don't mean no hurt to you.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.888
Jonathan, fetch some water here.

03:39.486 --> 03:42.389
What you doing way out here
in that there boat, little lady?

03:42.489 --> 03:46.650
Here, some cool liquid for you,
make you feel right.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.491
You gonna tell us now
what you doing out here?

03:56.253 --> 03:58.280
ROSE: I wish I could've told him.

03:58.380 --> 04:02.291
But it's only now that I
remember any of it at all.

04:19.526 --> 04:23.096
It was the second day on
one of those small dive boats

04:23.196 --> 04:25.140
that takes you around the islands.

04:25.240 --> 04:29.068
The engine had broken
down for the second time.

04:59.775 --> 05:02.142
(ENGINE STARTS)

05:47.030 --> 05:49.558
Keep her at half speed.

05:49.658 --> 05:52.860
No sense putting any
strain on that crankshaft.

05:54.788 --> 05:57.114
Here's your course.

06:00.001 --> 06:03.280
Three, three, zero. Northwest?

06:03.380 --> 06:07.875
Three, three, zero, North-northwest.

06:09.052 --> 06:10.495
Listen, my friend,

06:10.595 --> 06:14.416
what we must have on this
boat is accurate navigation.

06:14.516 --> 06:16.543
A sailor's best friend.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.672
It's the way he makes his way around
without losing his boat and his crew.

06:20.772 --> 06:25.684
It isn't how good-looking he is,
it's his ability to navigate.

06:26.695 --> 06:28.346
Sorry.

06:28.446 --> 06:31.106
Don't apologize, navigate.

07:02.772 --> 07:05.015
Jesus, look at the sun.

07:31.343 --> 07:33.919
See if you can raise
someone on the radio.

(WAVES GENTLY LAPPING)

09:18.908 --> 09:22.229
Norman, it's pitch black out there,
what do you expect to see?

09:22.329 --> 09:24.856
I don't like this one bit.

09:24.956 --> 09:27.567
I hope these people know
what they're doing.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.237
They must know what they are doing,
they're sailors, aren't they?

09:30.337 --> 09:33.622
So was the crew of the Titanic.

09:37.427 --> 09:39.079
Look Norman, if you're so worried,

09:39.179 --> 09:41.039
why don't you go upstairs and
help the captain steer the boat?

09:41.139 --> 09:43.041
I'm sure he'd be very grateful.

09:43.141 --> 09:45.634
I think I'll do just that.

09:50.398 --> 09:53.176
- Hey, how about a drink?
- No thank you.

09:53.276 --> 09:56.388
I'm going to speak to the
captain about this situation.

09:56.488 --> 09:57.847
Oh, relax.

09:57.947 --> 10:00.684
Besides, you won't get anything
out of him, I already tried.

10:00.784 --> 10:02.894
NORMAN: Well, don't you
think it's a bit unusual?

10:02.994 --> 10:05.272
You people ready for some dinner?

10:05.372 --> 10:08.365
Can anyone tell us what's
going on out there?

10:09.250 --> 10:12.570
I'm only the galley hand,
I don't know no more than you do.

10:12.670 --> 10:15.365
- Hey, Dobbs, how about a drink?
- Don't mind if I do.

10:15.465 --> 10:18.868
Yes, but you're an experienced seaman,
you... you must've encountered...

10:18.968 --> 10:20.787
No, I...

10:20.887 --> 10:23.422
take it neat, just the way it is.

10:26.351 --> 10:29.970
You mean to say you've never
seen anything like this?

10:30.855 --> 10:33.258
Can't says I ever have.

10:33.358 --> 10:35.719
Well, aren't you curious about it?

10:35.819 --> 10:38.478
Sea spits up what it can't keep down.

10:41.533 --> 10:44.568
CAPTAIN BEN: We've been
holding steady for half an hour.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.774
Steer one six five and keep
her below eight knots.

10:49.874 --> 10:52.701
Take another reading
in a couple of hours.

10:53.837 --> 10:55.822
You have any idea where we are?

10:55.922 --> 10:57.949
Will when the weather clears.

10:58.049 --> 11:02.294
In the meantime, keep checking the
radio and keep your eyes peeled.

11:36.004 --> 11:39.824
By the looks on your faces,
maybe I shouldn't eat this.

11:39.924 --> 11:43.870
Oh, your cook Dobbs here just
told us one hell of a yarn.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.455
Oh?

11:45.555 --> 11:49.501
What was it this time?
Sea monsters or ghost ships?

11:49.601 --> 11:52.719
Well, as a matter of fact,
it was ghost ships.

11:53.730 --> 11:56.257
Up to his old tricks again.

11:56.357 --> 11:59.677
You don't believe any of these
stories have some truth to them?

11:59.777 --> 12:02.097
Look, miss,

12:02.197 --> 12:06.726
I could match you story for
story with logical evidence,

12:06.826 --> 12:08.353
but what does it prove?

12:08.453 --> 12:10.522
Men at sea often have hallucinations.

12:10.622 --> 12:14.567
They work hard, they have eyestrain,
lack of sleep, exhaustion.

12:14.667 --> 12:17.320
Sometimes, they're just plain stupid.

12:17.420 --> 12:20.573
Why, some say they're
more afraid of water

12:20.673 --> 12:22.534
than little old ladies
are of the dark.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.619
Now just a minute,

12:24.719 --> 12:29.416
you mean to say that what we
all saw out there is just a mirage?

12:29.516 --> 12:32.877
It was a minor underwater disturbance.

12:32.977 --> 12:35.722
It was a hot sky acting
on a cold current

12:35.822 --> 12:38.266
coming from a mile down below.

12:38.566 --> 12:40.176
Dobbs was just saying...

12:40.276 --> 12:43.430
Oh, if everything that
old fart said came true,

12:43.530 --> 12:47.434
both he and me would be
in the deep six by now.

12:47.534 --> 12:51.312
Given the condition of this boat,
I wonder that hasn't happened already.

12:51.412 --> 12:53.106
Norman, please.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.733
What's bothering you, mister?

12:55.833 --> 13:00.447
It seems to me, you're taking an
unnecessary risk with a boat like this.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.782
What do you mean "a boat like this?"

13:02.882 --> 13:06.202
I mean, a broken down old tub

13:06.302 --> 13:10.957
that should've been retired years ago,
along with her captain.

13:11.057 --> 13:15.670
How is it that a used-car salesman
knows so all fired much about boats?

13:15.770 --> 13:17.964
I know enough to see that this boat

13:18.064 --> 13:20.884
is not what you people
would call "shipshape."

13:20.984 --> 13:23.803
The accommodations aren't worth
the money at half the price.

13:23.903 --> 13:27.807
I think that you have a
responsibility to your passengers.

13:27.907 --> 13:31.478
- We should turn around right now.
- Set back?

13:31.578 --> 13:34.147
For one crankshaft? No chance.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.774
The first thing you'd want
is a refund of your money,

13:36.874 --> 13:39.444
and I've already spent
your money on her.

13:39.544 --> 13:43.406
No, we're gonna sit
right here, and you...

13:43.506 --> 13:48.126
you people are going to get your money's
worth whether you like it or not.

13:57.645 --> 13:59.513
Ladies.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.230
Now I understand why
we're the only passengers.

14:09.741 --> 14:14.020
I think it's time for us to take
matters into our own hands.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.230
Take over the ship?

14:15.330 --> 14:17.023
I mean nothing of the sort.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.108
There are two other
crew members on board.

14:19.208 --> 14:21.903
They may not be smart, but they
seem to have their wits about them.

14:22.003 --> 14:24.489
I'll admit he is a bit unusual,

14:24.589 --> 14:26.241
but I think you're overreacting a bit.

14:26.341 --> 14:28.701
Overreacting? Am I?

14:28.801 --> 14:30.245
All right.

14:30.345 --> 14:32.288
I warned you people.

14:32.388 --> 14:35.166
You're inviting trouble
by not taking any action.

14:35.266 --> 14:38.426
I've spoken my mind,
my conscience is clear.

14:41.981 --> 14:43.424
Beverly.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.809
I think I'll stay up a little longer.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.729
I'll be in the cabin.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.744
Hi.

15:52.844 --> 15:55.538
- You really gave me a scare.
- Sorry.

15:55.638 --> 15:58.506
I guess we're all a
little jumpy tonight.

16:00.059 --> 16:02.510
Do you always steer
the boat with your feet?

16:05.898 --> 16:08.051
You're not very talkative, are you?

16:08.151 --> 16:11.102
Captain doesn't like us
messing with the passengers.

16:13.990 --> 16:16.351
Do you stay up here
every night by yourself?

16:16.451 --> 16:18.978
Ben was supposed to relieve me.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.397
He needs the rest more than I do.

16:21.497 --> 16:24.525
So, I've got the whole
dogwatch to myself.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.110
Dogwatch?

16:26.210 --> 16:28.988
It's the middle of the night watch.

16:29.088 --> 16:30.782
I like it.

16:30.882 --> 16:33.375
I get a chance to be alone.

16:34.469 --> 16:36.913
Can you really tell where
we're going from this?

16:37.013 --> 16:38.665
Sure.

we hit something!

a little while ago.

and he wasn't no place else.

checking the underside.

Beats me.

We'll know as soon as the
tide comes in and lifts us off.

was designed for the water,

to man submarines which
would never have to surface.

They could not be controlled.

48:31.592 --> 48:34.328

48:34.428 --> 48:37.290
made their behavior
unpredictable and erratic.

48:37.390 --> 48:39.917
There were even incidences when
they attacked their own soldiers.

48:40.017 --> 48:42.587
So they were withdrawn
for further study.

48:42.687 --> 48:46.340
