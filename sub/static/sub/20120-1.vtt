00:13.292 --> 00:18.792
The walls gave the people
a century of peace and security.

00:22.042 --> 00:24.709
The terror of being at their mercy

00:25.959 --> 00:29.209
and the humiliation of being
trapped became a distant memory.

00:32.417 --> 00:33.292
Until...

00:47.751 --> 00:51.834
The battle for humanity's survival

00:51.834 --> 00:54.584
began the moment the
Titans breached the wall.

00:57.375 --> 01:03.751
After innumerable casualties
among soldiers and civilians alike,

01:04.792 --> 01:08.918
it was learned that some Titans
were hiding among the humans.

01:10.209 --> 01:16.250
Finally, five years after
the first wall fell,

01:17.334 --> 01:21.751
humans succeeded in capturing one of
these disguised Titans: Annie Leonhart.

01:31.209 --> 01:32.417
Nevertheless...

01:34.417 --> 01:40.375
...the next threat to humanity
was already close at hand.

01:54.584 --> 01:55.292
Hey!

01:55.292 --> 01:56.334
Look!

02:02.834 --> 02:04.167
A Titan?!

02:04.167 --> 02:06.459
In the wall?!

02:06.459 --> 02:07.834
It can't be!

02:10.792 --> 02:12.709
Your orders, Section Commander?

02:12.709 --> 02:15.834
Huh? What? Hold on!

02:16.751 --> 02:19.834
Was that there just by coincidence?

02:20.459 --> 02:23.751
Or does this mean...?

02:29.083 --> 02:30.792
Pastor Nick?

02:30.792 --> 02:32.042
Whatever you do...

02:33.792 --> 02:37.292
...you must keep that
Titan out of the sunlight!

02:39.542 --> 02:40.417
Huh?

"Beast Titan"

04:18.625 --> 04:22.626
For now, we've covered
the Wall Titan with sheets.

04:23.334 --> 04:26.000
We'll take more proper
measures after sunset.

04:26.542 --> 04:27.417
I see.

04:28.167 --> 04:31.000
What are we supposed to make of this, Sir?

04:31.751 --> 04:34.542
I never imagined there were
Titans in the walls...

04:34.542 --> 04:36.751
No one did.

04:37.751 --> 04:41.209
There were only people who knew,
and people who didn't.

04:44.334 --> 04:46.375
What's the deal?!

04:46.375 --> 04:50.501
We just fought a Titan here.
Why are they keeping us in the dark?

04:51.584 --> 04:52.792
Business as usual.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.000
But what's scummiest of all...

04:57.083 --> 05:02.334
...is that there's no "official" reason
why all these people died.

05:05.334 --> 05:06.542
Now then,

05:07.667 --> 05:10.167
it's time for you to talk.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.626
What is this Titan?

05:15.918 --> 05:19.167
What is it doing inside the wall?

05:21.417 --> 05:27.375
And... why did you people
keep this a secret all this time?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.042
I have work to do!

05:35.042 --> 05:37.876
My church and followers
have been devastated!

05:37.876 --> 05:41.209
This is your fault! I
will demand restitution!

05:41.959 --> 05:44.918
Now let me back down!

05:44.918 --> 05:46.125
Certainly.

05:47.834 --> 05:50.000
Will straight down do?

05:52.626 --> 05:53.375
Section Commander!

05:53.375 --> 05:54.250
Stay back.

05:55.042 --> 05:57.167
Enough of this!

05:57.167 --> 06:02.292
Do you people know why we Scouts
have shed so much blood?!

06:02.918 --> 06:06.918
To take back our freedom from the Titans!

06:08.167 --> 06:11.834
I was willing to sacrifice
my own life for that cause!

06:13.167 --> 06:18.167
I'm not asking you to talk,
I'm ordering you. Is that clear?

06:18.751 --> 06:21.209
And if you won't talk,
I'll try the next person.

06:21.959 --> 06:27.542
Your measly life wouldn't
make up for much, anyway!

06:27.542 --> 06:30.209
Let... go of me!

06:30.209 --> 06:32.375
Like this? Right now?

06:32.834 --> 06:33.792
Yes!

06:34.209 --> 06:36.334
Fine, then. Die.

06:36.334 --> 06:37.209
Section Commander!

06:37.584 --> 06:40.959
Kill me and learn!

06:40.959 --> 06:44.334
We will fulfill our duty, without fail!

06:45.250 --> 06:46.125
So...

06:46.834 --> 06:52.292
...let go of me this instant!

06:56.083 --> 06:59.042
Deliver me... O Lord...

07:09.751 --> 07:11.584
Just kidding. I wasn't serious.

07:13.918 --> 07:16.584
Tell me, Pastor Nick...

07:18.459 --> 07:22.083
Are all the walls made of Titans?

07:24.334 --> 07:25.209
Section Commander...

07:26.083 --> 07:30.042
Whew, I forgot how this feels.

07:30.876 --> 07:36.459
I haven't felt this way since
my first time outside the walls.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.042
Talk about terrifying...

07:48.834 --> 07:51.375
Hurry! Inform Commander Erwin!

07:51.626 --> 07:53.125
Hurry!

07:53.125 --> 07:55.834
There are Titans inside Wall Rose!

08:08.959 --> 08:11.626
"12 hours earlier"

08:13.125 --> 08:16.417
"South of Wall Sina"

08:20.000 --> 08:24.209
My village isn't far south
of here, you know...

08:24.209 --> 08:26.667
My hometown is close by, too...

08:27.209 --> 08:31.125
Damn. Why can't I go visit?

08:32.583 --> 08:34.958
Maybe I'll sneak out at night.

08:34.958 --> 08:40.918
They told me not to come
back until I'm normal.

08:40.918 --> 08:45.667
They told me I was too
puny to be a soldier.

08:45.667 --> 08:50.876
Was genius enough to be one, though.
I was in our class' top ten.

08:50.876 --> 08:53.626
I'm gonna go make 'em eat their words.

08:54.167 --> 08:58.042
Conny. If you're serious, I'll help.

08:58.042 --> 08:59.751
What? How come?

09:00.542 --> 09:02.083
Doesn't it seem strange?

09:02.876 --> 09:05.000
We're on standby in our plain clothes,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.125
and we're not allowed to train
or wear our uniforms.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.125
Even more suspicious...

09:11.542 --> 09:13.417
...is that everyone else is fully armed.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.083
We're inside the wall,
not on the front line.

09:17.709 --> 09:19.292
Who are we fighting?

09:19.709 --> 09:23.834
Well, there are bears in the area.

09:23.834 --> 09:25.792
Yeah. Bears.

09:25.792 --> 09:27.834
Guns are enough to handle bears.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.709
I hear thuds! They sound like footsteps!

09:42.375 --> 09:43.042
Huh?

09:43.459 --> 09:45.584
Get serious, Sasha.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.959
If you're suggesting
there are Titans here...

09:49.042 --> 09:52.167
...that'd mean Wall Rose has fallen.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.250
Miche?

09:57.167 --> 10:01.000
Tomas! Take three couriers and go!

10:01.000 --> 10:01.667
Huh?

10:02.042 --> 10:03.459
Notify each district!

10:05.167 --> 10:09.292
There are likely no Titans among
the 104th Cadet Corps recruits!

10:11.459 --> 10:14.209
Multiple Titans from the south!

10:14.751 --> 10:17.584
Wall Rose has been breached!

10:19.542 --> 10:22.584
It's the truth! I really hear footsteps!

10:24.375 --> 10:25.459
Everyone here?

10:26.083 --> 10:27.000
Nanaba?

10:27.751 --> 10:30.584
Multiple Titans, 500 meters to the south.

10:31.209 --> 10:32.959
They're coming right this way.

10:33.626 --> 10:35.542
There's no time for you to gear up.

10:36.083 --> 10:40.542
Take your horses and evacuate
all nearby homes and settlements.

10:41.125 --> 10:41.959
Understood?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.751
From... the south?

10:46.209 --> 10:48.375
Has the wall been breached?!

10:50.417 --> 10:54.751
Get going! Lunch will
have to wait, I'm afraid!

10:59.667 --> 11:00.501
Miche.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.375
There are nine in that swarm up ahead.

11:10.334 --> 11:12.918
They've broken through Wall Rose.

11:16.918 --> 11:21.792
We never managed to uncover the Titans'
secrets or figure out what they are.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.709
And now the day has come.

11:26.584 --> 11:28.083
Humanity...

11:29.417 --> 11:30.417
...has lost.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.959
No. Not yet.

11:37.375 --> 11:42.000
Only when a person stops
fighting do they lose.

11:43.792 --> 11:47.626
As long as we continue to fight,
we are not beaten!

11:53.501 --> 11:56.417
As soon as the Titans reach the woods,

11:56.417 --> 12:01.626
we'll split into four teams
of recruits and soldiers alike,

12:01.626 --> 12:06.334
and then simultaneously scatter
in each direction!

12:06.334 --> 12:10.584
Avoid combat when possible
and focus on getting the word out!

12:10.584 --> 12:13.209
Is anyone familiar with this region?!

12:13.209 --> 12:14.209
M-Me!

12:14.709 --> 12:16.834
My town's north of here!

12:16.834 --> 12:19.167
I know the lay of the land well!

12:19.751 --> 12:21.375
And... so does Conny!

12:23.292 --> 12:24.667
Conny?!

12:24.667 --> 12:25.876
My village...

12:26.792 --> 12:28.792
My village is to the south...

12:29.209 --> 12:31.292
...where the Titans are coming from.

12:32.626 --> 12:36.209
I can take you to the nearby
villages. After that...

12:37.000 --> 12:38.667
...please let me visit mine.

12:41.125 --> 12:41.918
All right.

12:42.334 --> 12:45.083
You'll guide the southern team.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.125
Yes, Sir!

12:46.125 --> 12:47.584
I'll come with you, Conny.

12:48.375 --> 12:52.501
The south will be crawling with Titans.
It'll be the most dangerous.

12:52.501 --> 12:56.626
So? I was going to help you
sneak there anyway, remember?

12:56.626 --> 12:58.792
You coming, Bertholdt?

13:01.959 --> 13:04.417
Of course I'll come.

13:07.876 --> 13:09.417
As you may know,

13:09.417 --> 13:12.667
today marks the new darkest day
in humanity's history!

13:13.000 --> 13:18.417
If ever humankind needed
to give its all, that time is now!

13:18.417 --> 13:21.167
The Titans have reached the woods!

13:26.751 --> 13:28.501
Scatter!

13:28.501 --> 13:31.000
Ride as fast as you can!

13:42.709 --> 13:43.959
What?!

13:43.959 --> 13:45.834
They all started sprinting!

13:45.834 --> 13:47.834
Whoa! They're going to catch up!

13:49.250 --> 13:50.751
Gerger!

13:52.000 --> 13:54.542
Take charge of the southern team!

13:54.542 --> 13:55.709
Sir?!

13:57.459 --> 13:59.375
U-Understood.

13:59.834 --> 14:02.125
He's using himself as bait?!

14:02.125 --> 14:04.083
He won't survive! I'll help!

14:04.083 --> 14:07.334
No! We can't spare anyone else!

14:07.334 --> 14:08.751
Have faith in him!

14:09.459 --> 14:12.626
His skill is second only to Captain Levi!

14:12.626 --> 14:15.083
He'll make it back alive!

14:55.292 --> 14:56.542
Oh, Eren.

14:57.250 --> 15:00.125
Did you get into another fight?

15:00.125 --> 15:04.626
Those jerks started it!
They made fun of me!

15:04.626 --> 15:09.125
So, I assume Mikasa had to
come to your rescue again?

15:10.125 --> 15:11.000
Thanks.

15:16.584 --> 15:17.834
Eren.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.834
No matter how cruel someone is
or how much you hate them,

15:20.834 --> 15:23.000
you can't always charge at them head-on!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.709
You're a man!

15:26.709 --> 15:29.792
Show some restraint!
You need to be there for Mikasa, too!

16:18.375 --> 16:19.375
That's...

16:20.417 --> 16:21.459
It fell.

16:23.167 --> 16:25.792
You gotta be tired. Go get some sleep.

16:26.918 --> 16:29.000
Sorry. I'm fine.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.000
That thing's seen better days.

16:34.250 --> 16:37.000
I'll get you a new one
if I see any in our supplies.

16:44.125 --> 16:45.626
Eren! Mikasa!

16:46.292 --> 16:48.125
This is really bad!

16:48.125 --> 16:51.292
The Titans! They're inside Wall Rose!

16:58.292 --> 17:01.542
Ugh. Those damn Titans
never give us a break.

17:03.584 --> 17:04.709
Can you go?

17:05.876 --> 17:07.416
Not like there's much choice.

17:08.584 --> 17:13.166
It was wise to have
Section Commander Miche watch the 104th.

17:13.166 --> 17:15.250
I believe he can handle the situation.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.166
Yes.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.209
Let's hope so.

17:37.167 --> 17:38.876
Four left.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.459
No, it's time to go.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.334
I've bought enough time.

17:59.334 --> 18:00.375
Still...

18:01.250 --> 18:03.751
...I am concerned about that Abnormal.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.959
It's different.

18:06.626 --> 18:11.000
It looks over 17 meters tall. It's huge...

18:11.584 --> 18:15.751
And I've never seen
a Titan covered in fur before.

18:16.626 --> 18:20.834
It's just walking around
instead of coming for me.

18:20.834 --> 18:23.459
It's definitely an Abnormal, but...

18:26.125 --> 18:28.083
Great! You're back!

18:28.501 --> 18:31.250
I won't need to hold out until nightfall.

18:39.042 --> 18:41.459
It went for the horse?!

18:42.334 --> 18:43.542
You can't be serious!

19:05.167 --> 19:06.334
Wait.

19:27.125 --> 19:32.292
Huh? Didn't I just say to wait?

19:52.167 --> 19:55.000
Tell me, what is that weapon called?

20:00.375 --> 20:03.375
That thing on your waist that flies around.

20:15.626 --> 20:18.876
I'm certain we speak the same language.

20:18.876 --> 20:21.876
Perhaps you're simply too frightened.

20:22.751 --> 20:25.667
Oh, I see you use swords, too.

20:26.334 --> 20:30.542
I guess that means you know
we reside in the nape.

20:30.542 --> 20:34.375
Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.

20:59.417 --> 21:04.459
Only when a person stops
fighting do they lose.

21:09.417 --> 21:11.918
As long as we continue to fight...

21:13.459 --> 21:15.417
...we are not beaten!

21:22.834 --> 21:25.417
You can move now.

21:30.584 --> 21:34.959
No! No!

21:34.959 --> 21:39.459
Stop! Don't! No! No!

21:42.834 --> 21:45.667
So you can speak.

21:50.459 --> 21:54.959
I must say, what a clever idea.

21:57.375 --> 22:00.542
No! No!

22:00.542 --> 22:04.876
Stop! No!

23:41.459 --> 23:44.959
Titans have suddenly
appeared inside Wall Rose.

23:45.918 --> 23:48.209
The recruits from the 104th Cadet Corps

23:48.209 --> 23:51.334
scatter across the land to spread the news.

23:52.292 --> 23:56.292
Meanwhile, Eren and the others
head to their rescue.

23:58.042 --> 24:00.709
And after returning to her hometown,

24:00.709 --> 24:04.375
Sasha comes face-to-face with her past.

24:05.375 --> 24:07.375
Next episode: "I'm Home."
