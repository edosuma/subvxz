00:05.500 --> 00:09.100
I'm approaching the finish line 
of a 30 year odyssey.

00:10.100 --> 00:14.000
I won't let anyone else take the final steps for me.

00:14.500 --> 00:20.400
Listen to me, you son of a bitch !
You have been a plague on my life ! 
You repulse me !

00:20.400 --> 00:22.600
Every time I sat across from you 
listening to your lies,

00:22.700 --> 00:27.100
all I could fantasize about 
was slashing your throat !

00:27.800 --> 00:29.100
Drop it !

01:24.700 --> 01:27.100
Why are you wearing that ring ?

01:27.300 --> 01:33.400
Since that night... you've been missing for almost two years.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.400
There was a fire at your apartment.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.800
Will survived...

01:54.600 --> 01:55.900
But you...

02:04.700 --> 02:06.800
They found remains.

02:09.500 --> 02:10.699
The DNA...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.700
was a match.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.500
You were dead.

02:25.300 --> 02:26.700
You were dead.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.500
And...

02:38.500 --> 02:40.000
you got married.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.200
They asked me to come to Hong Kong... the Agency.

02:54.200 --> 03:01.400
They thought it would be best if... you were reintroduced by someone from your life before.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.000
They could have sent my father.

03:10.600 --> 03:15.400
He's CIA, he's... from my life before.

03:15.500 --> 03:19.900
I can't answer that. I chose not to stay with the CIA after your death.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.300
You're not with the Agency ?

03:24.500 --> 03:26.200
I'm a teacher.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.100
This is...

03:36.800 --> 03:39.100
gonna take me a while.

03:39.300 --> 03:45.000
They want me to bring you back.
I mean, you can imagine the kind of investigation that's being called.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.300
Hell of a way to wake up.

03:56.900 --> 03:59.600
How much time do I have before I have to go ?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.700
They said they want you back...

04:05.000 --> 04:08.300
I don't know who the hell you are, but you are not Vaughn, you son of a bitch !

04:08.900 --> 04:12.200
Tell me who the hell you're working for !
Is it Sloane ?

04:12.400 --> 04:15.300
Tell me you're working for Sloane !

05:43.200 --> 05:46.500
Don't... Don't do...

06:51.300 --> 06:55.100
You're safe. 
You're at the Stafford Naval Hospital.

06:56.100 --> 06:58.100
You're home again.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.300
There are no words to make this easy.

07:05.300 --> 07:10.800
It was Vaughn who came for you in Hong Kong. And what he told you was the truth.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.600
- What happened to me ?
- We don't know.

07:24.600 --> 07:30.200
Where's my father ? Or my mom ?
Have you heard from her since Mexico City ?

07:31.200 --> 07:33.000
Vaughn said Will's alive.

07:33.000 --> 07:36.100
If there was a fire in my apartment, 
if he thought I was dead,

07:36.100 --> 07:39.600
how did Will survive ? And where is he ?

07:40.100 --> 07:43.600
And Francie, is she dead ? 
Did they find her body, too ?

07:43.600 --> 07:46.500
- I know you have a million questions, but...
- I have a lot more than a million questions.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.600
- I which I only had a million questions !
- You're going to have to be patient. I'll talk to the...

07:49.600 --> 07:52.100
I can't be patient ! 
I woke up like it was one night !

07:52.100 --> 07:54.800
I have a scar on my stomach 
I have never seen before !

07:54.800 --> 07:56.300
You're telling me two years have passed,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.100
- and I have to be patient !?
- Listen to me, Sydney... You have to relax.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.800
I think I deserve to know what happened 
to the people in my life !

08:00.800 --> 08:06.200
- Where the hell is Kendall !? I want some answers !
- Kendall is not the director of our division anymore.

08:07.100 --> 08:10.600
I am. Almost six months now.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.000
Congratulations.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.300
How ya feelin' ?

08:27.300 --> 08:28.700
I'm okay.

08:29.800 --> 08:32.000
You look great... You lost weight.

08:32.600 --> 08:38.600
Oh, thanks, yeah. I sorta gave up all the foods that I enjoy. I'm miserable, but I look really good.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.400
We got something.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.300
I need just a minute. Excuse me.

08:44.300 --> 08:47.900
- I'm sorry to be all cryptic.
- It's okay. I get it.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.800
We received a transmission an hour ago 
from Mr. Kingsley.

08:54.800 --> 08:59.700
He got the package and the decoy. 
He's on schedule, aboard a train to Avignon.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.000
We've received an intel 
that the Covenant may be moving

09:05.000 --> 09:07.800
to intercept Kingsley and get the chip.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.800
- And we can't reach Kingsley ?
- No, he's radio silent.

09:15.800 --> 09:19.500
But we got the new lead : an address outside of Paris, a possible outpost for the Covenant.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.400
Contact the NSCF. Have them stop the train at the next station and recheck Kingley's ticket.

09:23.400 --> 09:24.700
He'll know to make contact.

09:25.000 --> 09:29.300
And get a team in prep. 
I want to raid this outpost.

09:34.900 --> 09:38.500
- I have to get back.
- Dixon, I want to see my dad.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.100
What is the big deal ?

09:50.100 --> 09:52.000
Your father is in prison.

09:53.800 --> 09:58.600
The National Security Council has had him
in solitary for almost a year.

09:59.700 --> 10:05.200
Their policy, without exception, 
is that he is to have no visitors.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Kingsley...

11:29.000 --> 11:35.300
You know what I want. Give it to me, and I make your death painless.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.900
One more time.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.700
My shoe ! My left shoe !

11:59.500 --> 12:01.000
Niet.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.400
Not what I wanted.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.200
Check his pockets.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.300
What ?

13:15.600 --> 13:16.700
You okay ?

13:19.100 --> 13:20.800
I think I know...

13:25.500 --> 13:27.000
Oh my God...

13:29.400 --> 13:31.500
I think I know where I was.

14:12.100 --> 14:16.600
- There's so many new people, I don't know anyone here.
- Ah, just give it time.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.100
Excuse me. Excuse me, hello.

14:19.100 --> 14:24.300
Hi, Sydney. I'm Marshall Flinkman.

14:24.300 --> 14:29.300
I work here. Tech design and operations here.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.300
- Of course I know who you are !
- Oh my God !

14:32.300 --> 14:38.500
Sydney, it's so amazing to see you, I can't even really relate. Actually, I wrote... a poem.

14:44.400 --> 14:48.100
I've lost my keys. Where are they ?

14:50.200 --> 14:51.600
Welcome back !

14:52.800 --> 14:55.600
- Hey, you're pregnant !
- Ooh, yeah, yeah... I am.

14:56.300 --> 14:59.400
I wonder who the father is...

15:01.200 --> 15:02.200
Are you guys married too ?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.300
- No !
- Not yet.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.400
- No. We're not married.
- We just haven't set the date yet.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.200
We're not even engaged,
we're just having a kid.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.200
- Well, we're talking about get marry...
- Not really !

15:09.200 --> 15:13.600
- Well, she just has an issue with wedlock.
- Syd... Dixon's expecting us.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.400
- If you need anything, just ask. Okay ?
- Thanks.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.900
I've lost my keys, where are they ? 
It's... it's a metaphor.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.700
We'd like to hear about what happened last night.

15:23.700 --> 15:28.400
I had a memory, a vivid memory of the interior of the building where I was being held.

15:28.400 --> 15:34.200
I know that I was in Paris, and I remember 
the faces of at least three of my captors.

15:34.700 --> 15:40.900
Mr. Weiss' report says you recall overhearing voices... names, including Mr. Kingsley.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.100
This is Robert Lindsay. 
He's our NSC liaison.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.700
So far, that's all I remember.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.400
Sounds like the group we're looking for 
is the one that was holding our girl.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.300
Last night, there was a mass murder 
on a French passenger train.

15:56.300 --> 16:00.100
Among the dead was 
a CIA asset : Scott Kingsley.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.600
Kingsley did engineering work for us. 
He designed an aircraft,

16:05.600 --> 16:09.000
a spy drone that could fly undetected by radar.

16:09.000 --> 16:13.800
Kingsley was en route to Avignon to deliver the schematics. They were stolen.

16:13.800 --> 16:17.100
And this drone could be converted 
into a delivery system.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.600
Biological weapons, chemical. 
I get it.

16:19.600 --> 16:23.900
This group, we know almost nothing about them. They refer to themselves as "The Covenant".

16:23.900 --> 16:27.400
We have some new intelligence 
identifying one of their outposts.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.900
We believe this is where they've taken the chip.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.400
We're planning and sending a team 
to Paris to raid the building.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.400
Look familiar ?

16:36.300 --> 16:38.700
See, we're going in, with or without you.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.400
Without you, we're blind.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.900
You might recognize details 
we might not see otherwise.

16:42.900 --> 16:48.400
I'm personally of the mind that sending you into the field so soon after your recovery 
is asinine.

16:48.400 --> 16:52.000
Well, Mr. Dixon, you might ask yourself just how much you want to apprehend these killers...

16:52.000 --> 16:55.800
- Do not question my resolve. What you are suggesting is premature...
- Perhaps if you'd listen

16:55.800 --> 16:57.990
to what I'm suggesting, certainly not that we throw Ms. ...

16:57.990 --> 17:01.200
I've experienced trauma myself. 
Returning to the field prematurely

17:01.200 --> 17:03.000
is as bad as not being trained at all !

17:03.000 --> 17:06.300
Okay, excuse me. I'm standing right here.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.599
I think I might be helpful in Paris.

17:10.099 --> 17:14.300
But I will not even consider going 
unless you help me first.

17:15.000 --> 17:19.000
I wanna see my father. 
Right now.

17:19.700 --> 17:21.900
Ms. Bristow, just so we're clear.

17:22.700 --> 17:28.700
I have no intention of ever doing 
your father one single favor. Ever.

17:31.700 --> 17:35.400
That being said, it's not your fault, he's your father.

17:35.700 --> 17:42.000
And I'm not without a heart, as you will come to see. I'll get you in this one time.

17:44.300 --> 17:45.400
Thanks.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.500
Sweetheart,

18:36.700 --> 18:38.600
you look so beautiful.

18:42.600 --> 18:48.200
They told me you were charged with resisting authority. Dad, I don't understand.

18:48.200 --> 18:52.800
I became obsessed with your death, 
with finding those responsible.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.700
And at a certain point in my pursuit, 
I needed help.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.500
So I contacted the one person I believed I could trust, given the circumstances.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.900
Your mother.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.000
You were working with mom !?

19:05.500 --> 19:09.200
At the time, she was number 6 
on the CIA's most wanted list.

19:09.200 --> 19:14.200
The National Security Council, primarily...
Robert Lindsay. You met him ?

19:15.300 --> 19:18.100
He discovered that I was collaborating with your mother, so he threatened me,

19:18.100 --> 19:20.600
questioned my allegiance to this country.

19:20.600 --> 19:27.600
He chose to make an example of me, 
an NSC power play, and here we are.

19:29.400 --> 19:35.100
I was told you have a memory, that you believe you were being held in Paris.

19:38.300 --> 19:42.100
It's an anti-eavesdrop device, I got it from Marshall. We have 90 seconds.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.800
- Dad, I don't remember a thing.
- What ?

19:44.800 --> 19:48.500
I read Dixon's lips when he was talking 
outside my hospital room.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.500
I just made it up to get leverage, and now they want to send me on a mission !

19:51.500 --> 19:54.500
- Leverage for what ?
- To see you.

19:54.600 --> 19:59.800
They told me I couldn't see you and...
I needed to.

20:02.800 --> 20:07.100
Dad, I don't know if I can explain what it's like waking up and having everything be different.

20:07.100 --> 20:10.200
My friends are gone, I have no job, 
I have no home,

20:10.200 --> 20:14.000
and Vaughn's married, and you're in prison...
- Vaughn what ?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.800
He got married.

20:18.400 --> 20:23.700
Michael Vaughn is just a boy who was never good enough for you anyway.

20:23.700 --> 20:27.500
Sydney, listen to me, 
my investigation into your death

20:27.500 --> 20:29.500
became even more disturbing than I expected.

20:29.500 --> 20:35.000
You must continue my work and find the truth about what happened to you. 
Do you understand me ?

20:35.000 --> 20:37.400
The only way to do that is by getting your CIA clearance restored,

20:37.400 --> 20:40.800
having access to my private files, getting back...

20:40.800 --> 20:42.600
Dad, I don't think I can do this without you.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.400
We both know that's not true, 
and you have no choice anyway.

20:45.400 --> 20:48.600
The CIA, I am certain, 
is dubious about your return,

20:48.600 --> 20:50.500
somehow you must get them to trust you again.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.700
If they learn you were bluffing 
about your memory, it's all over.

20:53.700 --> 20:57.900
Dad, what did you mean 
'the investigation was disturbing' ?

20:59.500 --> 21:04.700
I knew you were alive.
I made a discovery that you need...

21:17.100 --> 21:19.200
You probably know this...

21:21.900 --> 21:23.600
but I love you.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.300
I love you, too.

21:35.400 --> 21:38.900
The object of tonight's mission is to find and retrieve the microchip,

21:38.900 --> 21:40.300
also to acquire any intel

21:40.300 --> 21:42.300
about the organization known as "The Covenant",

21:42.300 --> 21:44.100
who we believe is in possession of this chip.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.900
We've had the building under satellite surveillance and it appears to be abandoned,

21:46.900 --> 21:47.900
but there are no guarantees.

21:47.900 --> 21:51.100
You've all met Agent Bristow. 
She was held prisoner in this building,

21:51.100 --> 21:52.800
so while I'll be leading this operation,

21:52.800 --> 21:56.600
we will take into consideration any warnings 
or insights that Agent Bristow has to offer.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.100
Any questions ?

21:58.100 --> 21:59.400
Let's go !

22:02.300 --> 22:03.400
You all right ?

22:20.300 --> 22:22.800
Retriever to base, we're in position. 
Any last minute fun ?

22:22.800 --> 22:25.000
We've got no activity outside the target building

22:25.000 --> 22:27.100
and thermal imaging shows 
the building to be clean.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.100
- That's good to hear.
- Anything from Mountaineer ?

22:29.100 --> 22:33.000
- Any of this look familiar ?
- Not yet.

22:33.700 --> 22:34.900
Negative.

22:34.900 --> 22:37.300
Retreiver, move on your call.

22:37.300 --> 22:41.400
Here we go. Let's watch out for tripwires 
and watch your backs. Let's move.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.200
Hey ! Remember any of this ?

23:07.200 --> 23:09.200
- Base to Retriever.
- Yeah, go base.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.300
We're picking up some company, quadrant 16, heading 2 o'clock.

23:12.300 --> 23:16.800
Retriever to team, be on the alert for possible hostile, quadrant 16 at door quadrant nine.

23:16.800 --> 23:21.600
Retriever, we're seeing activity. 
I'm counting three, now five additionals.

23:21.600 --> 23:25.500
Team, we now have five possible hostiles. 
Let's get ready to engage.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.500
Base, we're under attack ! 
We're under attack !

23:30.200 --> 23:33.500
Fall back now ! Fall back now !

23:34.700 --> 23:37.000
There are two more of them in quadrant six.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.800
All agents abort ! Fall back now !

23:39.800 --> 23:42.800
- Let's split up. We'll take 'em from behind.
- Okay.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.100
Come on, Morse !

24:16.100 --> 24:17.600
Stay with me.

25:31.600 --> 25:33.800
- Are you okay ?
- Go get him.

25:52.500 --> 25:56.500
- They're dead. All of them.
- Oh my God, Weiss...

25:57.000 --> 26:00.400
- If I'd told the truth, this might not have happened.
- What are you talking about ?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.800
I've never been here before.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.700
The dream I had...

26:07.200 --> 26:12.100
I just had to regain the CIA's trust...
and now the team's dead.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.800
Syd, this operation was on, 
whether you came or not.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.400
And if you hadn't, I'd be dead, too.

26:21.500 --> 26:25.800
I don't know what to do, I...everything's wrong, everything's upside down...

26:25.800 --> 26:28.500
- Syd, we gotta get home.
- I can't go back !

26:29.500 --> 26:32.300
Robert Lindsay hates my father.
He doesn't trust me.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.000
He wanted results from this operation, 
he wanted the chip.

26:36.100 --> 26:38.400
If I go back after this, he'll pull my clearance

26:38.400 --> 26:41.600
and I'll never be able to help my father.

26:44.600 --> 26:47.700
- What are you thinking ?
- This was obviously an ambush.

26:50.300 --> 26:55.600
Those gunmen work for the Covenant. 
The one that was going to kill you, I saw his face.

26:55.600 --> 27:00.600
If I can make a positive ID, that could lead to the chip... leverage.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.600
- To do what ?
- To get my father out of custody !

27:05.000 --> 27:09.100
To recover what was stolen from the CIA, to make sure these men didn't die for nothing.

27:09.900 --> 27:12.400
I'm going to need a contact, a freelancer.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.600
Not with the CIA. Someone with resources.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.100
All of my names are two years old.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.000
You're not gonna like my suggestion.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.600
You should go see Arvin Sloane.

27:26.800 --> 27:27.600
What ?

27:27.600 --> 27:33.800
Slaone negotiated a pardon after your... death. He's now a consultant for the CIA.

27:34.400 --> 27:39.600
Yeah, he now runs a World Health Organization in Zurich : Omnifam.

27:43.300 --> 27:46.800
Listen to me. 
We never had this conversation.

27:46.800 --> 27:50.100
After the gunfight, I disappeared.
You never saw me again.

27:50.100 --> 27:52.500
Syd, what are you gonna do ?

28:05.200 --> 28:08.800
Excuse me. Miss ? 
Miss, you can't go in there !

28:25.600 --> 28:28.600
It's okay. 
We're fine.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.400
Hello, Sydney.

28:36.100 --> 28:42.300
There's a group the CIA has targeted. 
They call themselves "The Covenant".

28:43.100 --> 28:45.500
They've stolen something I need to get back.

28:45.500 --> 28:51.300
I've made a visual ID of one of their members. 
I need to put a name to his face.

28:52.700 --> 28:55.200
You're going to help me find him.

28:55.500 --> 28:59.700
Well, you must be in real trouble 
to come to me for assistance.

29:15.800 --> 29:24.900
His name is Gordeï Volkov. He's a former Russian MVD. A high class hitman.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.900
You just happened to have this file 
sitting on your desk...

29:27.900 --> 29:30.900
I had it ready because I was expecting you.

29:31.700 --> 29:37.000
Sydney, I know you've gone rogue 
and that your father is being held in solitary,

29:37.000 --> 29:42.200
and based on my personal experience with you, 
I would say that you're looking for a way 
to win his freedom.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.700
Am I right ?

29:48.400 --> 29:52.900
Sydney, just try and remember the bond 
that we had between us, you and I.

29:52.900 --> 29:56.700
I loved you like a daughter, I loved you.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.600
And even you would admit there were times, 
I would see it in your eyes,

30:00.600 --> 30:03.300
you looked at me like I was your...

30:07.400 --> 30:09.200
Where the hell have I been the last two years ?

30:09.200 --> 30:11.200
I know it was you !
What the hell did you do to me ?

30:11.200 --> 30:14.100
- Sydney, do you believe in redemption ?
- Not for you, no.

30:14.100 --> 30:17.200
We've helped to feed over 3 and half million children worldwide.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.400
We do research,

30:19.400 --> 30:23.400
our work on cancer has the potential to save millions of lives, Sydney.

30:23.400 --> 30:26.900
So much has changed since you've been gone.

30:37.300 --> 30:43.600
You remember the Rambaldi device ? The machine designed 500 years ago by a prophet ?

30:45.400 --> 30:49.500
All I did was bring all the pieces together 
and have it assembled.

30:49.500 --> 30:54.300
And when I turned it on, it delivered a message, as I suspected it would.

30:56.300 --> 31:02.500
I wasn't prepared for what it said. The message was just one word, one simple word :

31:03.500 --> 31:04.800
Peace.

31:07.300 --> 31:11.500
The epiphany I had at that moment, 
suddenly I saw all the mistakes I'd made,

31:11.500 --> 31:16.500
the pain I had inflicted on the world, 
the people I loved.

31:16.500 --> 31:21.300
So I chose right then and there to give information to the CIA

31:21.300 --> 31:26.800
with which they were able to dismantle 
over 2 dozen terrorist cells.

31:27.200 --> 31:31.100
I don't know how you convinced the CIA 
that you're trustworthy.

31:31.100 --> 31:32.800
Why don't you check my files ?

31:32.800 --> 31:37.300
I know you too well. 
I don't buy any of it.

31:52.200 --> 31:53.000
Allô ?

31:53.400 --> 31:55.000
Allô, je cherche M. Marchon.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.500
Il n'y a pas de Marchon ici.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.000
Merci.

32:24.000 --> 32:26.500
- Allô ?
- Puis-je parler à M. Bagnard ?

32:26.800 --> 32:31.700
I tried to reach over two dozen contacts. 
You're the only one still active.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.600
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

32:35.500 --> 32:40.700
Forgive me if I look shocking to you, 
but I was believing that you were dead.

32:40.700 --> 32:43.600
I was. 
But now I'm not.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.900
This is why I love our business.

32:45.900 --> 32:48.700
- I need some information.
- I hope I can help you.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.900
Gordeï Volkov.

32:55.200 --> 32:58.300
Lindsay !
I just got a call from the DOJ.

32:58.300 --> 33:01.300
You had Sydney Bristow listed 
as an enemy of the state !?

33:01.300 --> 33:04.400
Dixon, your operative ran. 
Sydney Bristow is a fugitive...

33:04.400 --> 33:06.800
This is why I did not want 
to send her out to begin with.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.700
In her condition, we should be helping her, not...

33:08.700 --> 33:11.300
I hate to pull rank, but the Department of Justice is my jurisdiction.

33:11.300 --> 33:14.900
- Blindly trusting Sydney...
- I've never suggested we blindly trust anyone,

33:14.900 --> 33:17.200
but classifying her in this way 
makes her a target !

33:17.200 --> 33:21.200
- Can you make a suggestion ?
- I suggest we use our resources to locate her.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.900
Oh, she'll be located.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.700
I want her back in this office alive !

33:28.000 --> 33:33.100
Volkov has a meeting scheduled for tomorrow night in Prague. I have the address.

33:33.100 --> 33:37.300
He's supposed to be delivering something.
What it is ? I do not know.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.900
Perhaps it is your thing.

33:39.900 --> 33:45.600
- Do you know what he drives ?
- A Sedan... armored, of course... with a protective detail.

33:45.600 --> 33:50.500
If you want to stop that car, 
you will need... backup.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.600
No I don't.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.400
But I will need clothes.

37:01.300 --> 37:03.800
I have the plans for the drone.

37:03.800 --> 37:08.500
If you want them back, get the NSC 
to release my father immediately.

37:08.500 --> 37:11.700
Excuse me ! 
I won't be blackmailed by a fugitive !

37:11.700 --> 37:15.600
- Did you really think you could come in here 
and threaten me ?
- Yeah.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.300
What the hell are you doing ?

37:17.300 --> 37:21.200
I want it in writing that today is the day Jack Bristow is to be released from custody.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.000
- Mr. Dixon, talk to her.
- I'm addressing you, Mr. Lindsay.

37:24.000 --> 37:29.400
- I want that 'get out of jail free' card for my father or these are gone !
- This is ridiculous !

37:29.400 --> 37:31.300
Mr. Dixon, please provide Mr. Lindsay with a pen.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.500
I've got my own pen, 
and there's not a chance I'm using it.

37:34.500 --> 37:37.200
- It's your call. 5...
- This is insane !

37:37.200 --> 37:40.000
- 4...
- Mr. Lindsay, she will destroy those plans.

37:40.000 --> 37:44.300
3... 2... 1...

37:44.300 --> 37:45.400
Fine !

37:51.000 --> 37:52.100
Thank you.

37:52.900 --> 37:56.900
- B-R-I-S-T-O-W
- I know how to spell your name !

38:25.100 --> 38:27.700
I came by to see how you were.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.400
Are you kidding me ?

38:33.700 --> 38:35.400
No, I... just wanted to make sure that you...

38:35.400 --> 38:39.900
You didn't come here to see how I am, 
you came here to see how you are,

38:39.900 --> 38:43.100
because you know in your heart what you did, you wanna make sure you're okay.

38:44.800 --> 38:48.300
I buried you. Consider that for what that's...

38:48.300 --> 38:50.300
Don't use rational thought as a defense with me,

38:50.300 --> 38:53.200
not after all you and I have seen.

38:53.800 --> 39:00.600
Vaughn, you and I live and breathe madness every day on the job. There is no... 
rational thought !

39:03.300 --> 39:05.900
I can't even pretend to have a conversation 
about anything else with you.

39:05.900 --> 39:08.400
What it comes down to is faith.

39:08.400 --> 39:09.900
What I was hoping you would say is :

39:09.900 --> 39:12.000
"Sydney, I gave up, I gave up on us. I lost faith."

39:12.000 --> 39:15.800
But what you came here for was closure,

39:15.800 --> 39:20.800
and there is not a chance 
you are getting that from me.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.900
I'm not gonna say I understand.
I'm not gonna sympathize with you

39:26.900 --> 39:31.100
and tell you how hard it must be for you. 
But you wanna know how I am ?

39:31.100 --> 39:37.500
I am horrible, Vaughn ! I am ripped apart ! 
And not because I lost you

39:37.500 --> 39:45.800
but because if it had been me, 
I would have waited

39:47.000 --> 39:50.900
I would have found the truth, 
I wouldn't have given up on you.

39:55.200 --> 40:04.800
And now I realize... what an absolute waste 
that would have been.

40:44.700 --> 40:45.900
Thank you.

40:56.400 --> 41:00.800
There's something I need to show you. 
Not here.

41:02.200 --> 41:06.500
Almost a year after your apparent death, 
I was on an operation.

41:07.900 --> 41:15.700
One of the men I was tracking was this man :
Andrean Lazarey, Russian diplomat.

41:16.300 --> 41:18.700
I've never seen him before.

41:20.700 --> 41:23.700
This was from a hidden camera that I placed.

41:39.600 --> 41:45.000
This is how I knew you were alive. 
You don't recall that man at all ?

42:05.500 --> 42:10.500
