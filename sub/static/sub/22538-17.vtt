01:21.290 --> 01:22.760
That's they're, Sammy. Shake your moneymaker.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.440
Come on, Sammy!

01:24.540 --> 01:26.490
Go, Sammy!

01:27.910 --> 01:28.920
Dad?

01:29.050 --> 01:31.820
Yeah, Sammy!

01:37.530 --> 01:40.070
that's my boy!

01:40.480 --> 01:42.810
come on, move those feet, Sammy.

01:44.650 --> 01:47.420
Go, Sammy!

01:49.120 --> 01:52.170
go, Sammy!

02:00.430 --> 02:03.620
dad!

02:06.050 --> 02:09.830
just give me another six hours.

02:11.730 --> 02:14.460
Windy, what are you doing in my bed?

02:14.550 --> 02:16.240
I think there's a mouse in my apartment.

02:16.320 --> 02:17.650
I couldn't sleep there.

02:17.730 --> 02:19.500
Windy, when we exchanged keys,

02:19.590 --> 02:21.950
it was in case of emergency.

02:22.020 --> 02:25.000
Since when are mouse droppings not an emergency?

02:25.050 --> 02:27.990
Okay, was--was it mouse or mouse droppings?

02:28.070 --> 02:33.630
mouse droppings are like the encyclopedia salesman's brochures of the rodent world.

02:33.720 --> 02:37.900
They let you know that they were there and that they're coming back soon.

02:37.990 --> 02:38.890
yeah.

02:39.530 --> 02:42.140
Why do mice and only mice get "droppings"

02:42.220 --> 02:45.270
when every other critter gets poop or crap or turd?

02:45.350 --> 02:49.620
Well, rabbits have also been bestowed with droppings.

02:49.700 --> 02:52.010
Bats have guano, and cows have dung.

02:52.080 --> 02:53.350
Right.

02:53.450 --> 02:54.740
And then there's manure.

02:54.820 --> 02:55.960
I always forget about manure.

02:56.050 --> 03:00.640
Yeah, Windy,this is not how I prefer to start my day--

03:00.710 --> 03:03.830
discussing the species of feces.

03:06.760 --> 03:09.340
I had the dream again.

03:09.720 --> 03:10.770
of the future?

03:10.850 --> 03:12.670
Every night now.

03:12.790 --> 03:16.620
Different versions of me being there.

03:16.690 --> 03:18.040
What do you think it means?

03:18.100 --> 03:20.670
I think it means I'm further away than I ever was.

03:20.770 --> 03:21.780
Or...

03:21.870 --> 03:26.360
maybe rather possibly...

03:26.510 --> 03:30.610
maybe rather possibly what?

03:31.260 --> 03:38.560
Maybe rather possibly it means that you are close to going back.

03:41.370 --> 03:43.260
My name is Sam Tyler.

03:43.380 --> 03:46.770
I was in an accident,and I woke up in 1973.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.920
I don't know how or why I'm here,

03:49.000 --> 03:50.320
but whatever's happened,

03:50.390 --> 03:52.510
it's like I've landed on a different planet.

03:52.570 --> 03:57.710
Now maybe if I can work out the reason, I can get home.

03:58.000 --> 04:03.180

04:04.010 --> 04:07.900
People have got to know whether or not their president's a crook.

04:07.990 --> 04:09.320
Well,I'm not a crook.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.440
I've earned everything I've got.

04:14.680 --> 04:15.920
it's the end of days, Ray.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.510
Not so fast.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.390
I believe him.

04:18.470 --> 04:19.940
He ain't no crook.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.650
You'll see. Dick non's in for the long run.

04:22.750 --> 04:26.230
or maybe you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.

04:26.310 --> 04:28.270
for good this time.

04:31.350 --> 04:33.660
he's never gonna get over this.

04:34.310 --> 04:36.420
What's funny, Chris?

04:36.580 --> 04:38.300
Well, I tend for McGovern.

04:38.390 --> 04:39.180
come on, right over here.

04:39.270 --> 04:40.640
But don't tell Ray.

04:40.750 --> 04:41.950
Okay.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.350
1-2-5 squad. Detective Tyler.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.810
hello, Sam.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.940
Still want to go home?

04:57.030 --> 04:57.660
Of course.

04:57.820 --> 05:00.400
I'm going to need you to do three things, Sam.

05:00.490 --> 05:02.990
You do these three things, you'll be back.

05:03.070 --> 05:03.870
Three things?

05:04.000 --> 05:07.680
First, I'm going to need you to save yourself, Sam.

05:07.790 --> 05:08.740
What do you mean?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.540
You have to save yourself.

05:10.620 --> 05:12.140
That's the first thing.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.790
I'll be in touch.

05:14.290 --> 05:16.080
I-- hello?

05:16.480 --> 05:18.200
Hello? Hello?

05:18.310 --> 05:20.220
ma'am, hold it! Come on!

05:20.310 --> 05:22.630
-Rose?
-Detective Skywalker! Please!

05:22.720 --> 05:23.460
Are you okay? What is it?

05:23.540 --> 05:24.990
It's--it's Sammy.

05:25.080 --> 05:25.780
My Sammy!

05:25.860 --> 05:26.650
What about him?

05:26.760 --> 05:27.860
He's gone.

05:27.950 --> 05:32.460
His father came and took him, and he's gone.

05:42.610 --> 05:46.680
You saying Vic is been coming around in the neighborhood and you neglected to let us know.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.590
He told me it was all a misunderstanding,

05:48.680 --> 05:50.860
that he was wrongly accused,

05:50.950 --> 05:53.710
that the cops--that you people were trying to railroad him.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.210
And you believed him?

05:55.310 --> 06:00.550
Lady, how many times does one guy have to crap on your head before you stop wearing it as a hat?

06:00.640 --> 06:01.600
-Ray!
-What?

06:01.680 --> 06:02.970
Easy.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.400
Okay.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.960
Rose...

06:06.250 --> 06:09.180
just tell us what happened, please.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.770
he came by today.

06:12.030 --> 06:15.470
He brought me flowers, a toy for Sammy.

06:15.560 --> 06:18.170
He said that--that he would be able to fix everything,

06:18.230 --> 06:21.300
that everything was gonna be okay and we can be a family again

06:21.380 --> 06:24.670
And then he asked me to go fetch him one of those ice cream cups he likes...

06:24.740 --> 06:27.800
and I went into the kitchen, and then when I came back,

06:27.870 --> 06:31.230
he was gone with Sa--with Sammy.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.790
all right, put out an alarm.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.090
Moskowitz, have the troops looking for vic tyler yet again.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.900
Considered armed and dangerous,and he's got his kid in tow.

06:38.980 --> 06:40.360
got it.

06:40.630 --> 06:41.910
Ray.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.800
Look at those cavemen go.

06:46.420 --> 06:52.660
Rose, do you have any idea where Vic might've taken little Sammy?

06:52.740 --> 06:54.770
He has a-a room...

06:54.850 --> 06:56.800
in--in a basement down on Garrett.

06:56.870 --> 06:59.460
A-a little room. Maybe they're there.

06:59.550 --> 07:00.880
Okay.

07:01.660 --> 07:02.820
you have an address?

07:02.910 --> 07:03.880
Oh, yes.

07:09.110 --> 07:10.470
Good.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.770
Thanks, ma. I mean...

07:13.880 --> 07:15.560
thank you.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.520
Detective?

07:18.630 --> 07:19.270
Yeah?

07:19.360 --> 07:24.130
When you find Sammy, will you give him this, please?

07:24.240 --> 07:26.880
it's his favorite.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.040
Don't worry, Rose.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.660
We're gonna find Sammy.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.180
And you and he are gonna have a long life together.

07:34.260 --> 07:37.620
And when you're gray and old,

07:37.720 --> 07:40.350
he's gonna read "Gulliver's travels" to you.

07:40.440 --> 07:43.200
How can you be so sure?

07:44.470 --> 07:46.470
Trust me.

07:46.590 --> 07:48.520
I know.

07:56.260 --> 07:59.390
what's taking Ray and Chris so long to get here?

07:59.500 --> 08:01.980
you okay, detective?

08:02.090 --> 08:03.110
Yeah.

08:06.350 --> 08:08.190
no.

08:08.370 --> 08:10.480
We gotta find little Sammy.

08:10.580 --> 08:13.330
Vic Tyler is...

08:14.860 --> 08:16.040
well...

08:18.580 --> 08:20.130
this guy shot you.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.710
I appreciate that.

08:21.790 --> 08:24.880
The five men have shot me since I been on the job,

08:24.970 --> 08:27.090
I swore I'd hunt them down, each and every one--

08:27.160 --> 08:32.840
even those that were in jail or dead-- until I realized that was a fool's mission.

08:32.919 --> 08:34.809
Revenge is for the weak.

08:34.890 --> 08:37.679
The strong? They...

08:37.760 --> 08:46.560
brush it off and say, thanks for the gunshot, dinkweed, but I didn't even feel it.

08:46.630 --> 08:49.290
Yeah, it's--it's just...

08:49.370 --> 08:51.480
this family...

08:51.540 --> 08:54.110
I feel connected to them...

08:54.150 --> 08:55.050
somehow.

08:55.130 --> 08:56.980
You got family, Tyler?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.300
In Hyde?

08:58.380 --> 08:59.880
Nope.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.890
Not anymore.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.870
Not so much that you'd hope

09:03.950 --> 09:06.690
So maybe that is why you came to the 1-2-5,

09:06.770 --> 09:09.010
cause we're just a big brick-blasting,

09:09.090 --> 09:14.190
crime-stopping, ass-kicking family, aren't we, then?

09:14.450 --> 09:15.760
I suppose you are.

09:15.850 --> 09:18.680
I suppose we are, you mean.

09:18.780 --> 09:21.620
I suppose we are, I mean.

09:22.510 --> 09:24.240
All right.

09:27.140 --> 09:34.520
boss, what if I told you that I don't know what or where Hyde is?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.750
And what if I told you...

09:37.850 --> 09:45.830
that I was hit by a car in 2008, and I woke up here?

09:45.900 --> 09:49.520
What would you say about all that?

09:55.160 --> 09:56.930
I'd say...

09:57.020 --> 09:59.820
that explains everything.

10:02.370 --> 10:04.110
yeah.

10:06.550 --> 10:09.000
We don't have to wait for Chris and Ray.

10:09.090 --> 10:12.020
Let's get this candle lit.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.720
You really been shot five times, Gene?

10:15.800 --> 10:19.070
Shot five times. Shot at, 351 times.

10:19.150 --> 10:20.220
You count?

10:20.300 --> 10:26.130
Two things you always count, Tyler-- gunshots and blessings.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.300
you take the front.

10:31.370 --> 10:33.240
I'll take the back.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.540
stop right there, cowboy.

10:47.610 --> 10:50.150
Don't move. Back it up.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.200
Put 'em on.

11:07.930 --> 11:10.510
Where's the key?

11:32.170 --> 11:33.790
how you doin', kiddo?

11:35.730 --> 11:37.300
daddy's home.

11:40.490 --> 11:43.380
Hey, bumper, grab that for me.

11:43.510 --> 11:44.900
Don't mind him, Sammy.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.600
He's just sleepin', huh?

11:46.670 --> 11:47.500
He's our buddy.

11:47.560 --> 11:50.330
He's a good guy, but he's always tired.

11:50.400 --> 11:51.480
how about a trip, Sammy, huh?

11:51.550 --> 11:52.800
You wanna take a trip? You go far away?

11:52.890 --> 11:55.160
Then mommy should come meet us. We'll have a real good time.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.030
You know, we'll, uh, we'll eat ice cream and hunt for crabs all day on the beach?

11:58.110 --> 11:59.300
That sound good, huh?

11:59.530 --> 12:00.970
That sounds good.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.940
Yeah, that sounds good.

12:03.820 --> 12:05.460
Look at bumper.

12:06.780 --> 12:07.770
No.

12:07.870 --> 12:08.820
No.

12:11.210 --> 12:13.640
get me in the van. Come on, let's go

12:14.970 --> 12:17.610
your husband was wanted by the law,

12:17.710 --> 12:19.660
and you let him just come in and out of your home

12:19.750 --> 12:22.140
whenever he wanted without letting us know.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.010
Which is called "hindering prosecution,"

12:24.080 --> 12:26.780
and can land you square in the pokey.

12:26.850 --> 12:28.250
Sir...

12:28.340 --> 12:29.280
what is it, no-nuts?

12:29.340 --> 12:31.620
Maybe we should take it easy on her.

12:32.390 --> 12:34.150
we got a wit, says he saw o guys--

12:34.240 --> 12:37.150
one that matches Vic's description-- with a little kid,

12:37.240 --> 12:38.600
carrying a drunk into the van.

12:38.670 --> 12:39.960
He didn't catch the plates, though.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.120
You see-ur man was taken.

12:42.190 --> 12:45.090
I know. I-I feel terrible about detective Skywalker.

12:45.170 --> 12:46.440
-Who?
-What?

12:46.520 --> 12:47.720
Detective Skywalker.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.230
Yeah, we don't know who that is.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.690
Luke. Luke. Luke Skywalker.

12:51.780 --> 12:54.160
I am not in a pleasant mood, lady,

12:54.230 --> 12:58.610
so you either tell us where that scheming guttersnipe husband of yours took my guy,

12:58.690 --> 13:00.470
or you'll be baking tuna casserole

13:00.540 --> 13:04.730
for 300 ugly broads in a crappy kitchen in the women's penitentiary!

13:04.800 --> 13:06.920
I don't know!

13:06.990 --> 13:08.780
Don't you think I would tell you if I knew?!

13:08.850 --> 13:11.350
He's got my son!

13:12.500 --> 13:15.030
he's got my son.

13:37.480 --> 13:38.340
where's the boy?

13:38.420 --> 13:39.170
The boy's just fine.

13:39.270 --> 13:40.420
Where?

13:40.930 --> 13:42.820
You think I'd hurt my own son?!

13:42.910 --> 13:44.660
is that what you think?!

13:44.750 --> 13:49.050
that's what we call irony.

13:58.020 --> 14:00.800
you're a freak, you know that?

14:00.890 --> 14:03.090
you're one fine freak.

14:06.500 --> 14:11.310
But I recognized that the first time I ever laid eyes on you.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.350
You know what else you are?

14:13.500 --> 14:16.410
you're the missing piece of the puzzle.

14:16.490 --> 14:20.030
And I didn't realize it until you came galloping into the flop this morning.

14:20.080 --> 14:21.360
What the hell you talking about?

14:21.430 --> 14:25.190
We're making big moves, a brand-new operation.

14:25.270 --> 14:27.710
We're gonna make so much money

14:27.770 --> 14:31.380
that we're gonna be able to make a cash offer for the whole island of Manhattan.

14:31.430 --> 14:35.070
We're gonna eat roast beef three times a day.

14:35.130 --> 14:38.940
all I need is a man inside--

14:39.030 --> 14:45.120
a cop on my pad-- and that's where you fit in.

14:45.200 --> 14:46.240
You can't do this, Vic.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.550
Sure I can, and with your help.

14:48.610 --> 14:51.630
You know, you play this boy scout, but you're really a demon.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.750
I can see that.

14:52.810 --> 14:54.670
You're a bloodthirsty mongrel,

14:54.770 --> 14:58.250
you're depraved and you're furious because you want things to be different.

14:58.310 --> 15:00.130
I can see that, too.

15:00.190 --> 15:05.720
Because after all, it takes one to know one...

15:05.970 --> 15:08.280
boy.

15:11.830 --> 15:13.350
Hi, Rose.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.140
Lieutenant hunt asked me to talk to you.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.430
"Twirl to twirl," as he put it.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.030
You know, I gotta say, I don't know how you work with those men.

15:23.110 --> 15:30.230
Well, I just pretend it's far, far in the future, and they work for me.

15:30.300 --> 15:34.640
Rose, I need you to think-- where would Vic take them?

15:34.710 --> 15:36.970
Where would he take little Sammy?

15:37.050 --> 15:39.500
I don't know.

15:39.620 --> 15:41.900
I don't know anything about him anymore.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.980
We've been together 11 years, married for 7. But he’s...

15:46.060 --> 15:48.320
he's a stranger to me now.

15:48.400 --> 15:53.130
Detective Skywalker-- he...

15:53.200 --> 15:56.510
talks about you and Sammy.

15:56.570 --> 15:59.450
You're on his mind a lot.

15:59.520 --> 16:01.400
Why is that, do you think?

16:01.470 --> 16:04.820
Well, I think it's because a lot of ways,

16:04.900 --> 16:08.490
you remind him of his own mother.

16:08.580 --> 16:09.850
It's funny, you saying that.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.600
Why?

16:14.170 --> 16:17.200
sometimes...

16:17.290 --> 16:21.860
when I'm with him-- detective Skywalker-- I swear...

16:21.940 --> 16:26.490
it's like I'm looking at my own Sammy...

16:26.570 --> 16:29.340
all grown up.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.860
it's occurred to me many times...

16:32.930 --> 16:36.420
as a mother, you have a vision of...

16:36.620 --> 16:40.870
of what your child is gonna be like as an adult.

16:40.950 --> 16:47.910
And, for me, my--my idea-- my ideal of little Sammy as a man

16:48.000 --> 16:50.710
always goes to detective Skywalker.

16:50.770 --> 16:53.020
Oh,it's silly, I know.

16:54.190 --> 16:55.990
no.

16:56.100 --> 16:57.690
Not at all.

17:29.230 --> 17:30.880
Vic wasn't always like this.

17:30.970 --> 17:34.340
We had really great times in the beginning, really great times.

17:34.410 --> 17:35.620
You were happy?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.550
Very happy.

17:39.820 --> 17:42.760
when were you the happiest?

17:42.850 --> 17:46.210
It's not so much when as where.

17:46.280 --> 17:52.420
before Sammy was born, we used to summer in this lovely little seaside town.

17:52.520 --> 17:56.920
In fact, it's where Sammy was conceived.

18:00.870 --> 18:03.580
what was the name of the town, Rose?

18:03.680 --> 18:05.860
Hyde.

18:07.060 --> 18:11.480
The name of the town was Hyde.

18:39.890 --> 18:42.030
you wanted to say good-bye to your father.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.710
We just chose which father.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.050
You're almost there, Sam.

18:47.130 --> 18:49.700
You're so close.

18:49.860 --> 18:56.970
the sandman's coming from a distant star his silver--

18:57.030 --> 18:58.460
what is this place?

18:58.530 --> 19:01.330
I had to bring her here.

19:03.160 --> 19:06.410
She missed her Hyde.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.270
1-2-5 squad.

20:07.350 --> 20:09.830
Yeah, this is detective Tyler. Get me lieutenant hunt.

20:09.940 --> 20:11.040
Detective, where are you?

20:11.150 --> 20:11.840
You all right?

20:11.920 --> 20:12.960
It's Rizzo.

20:13.040 --> 20:13.680
Yeah.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.460
I--

20:15.870 --> 20:20.810
hey there, Sam. Back to the egg, huh, fella?

20:20.930 --> 20:22.740
What do you want?

20:22.860 --> 20:24.140
What is this place?

20:24.240 --> 20:25.910
It's the mother ship, Sam.

20:26.010 --> 20:29.080
It's where it all begins and ends.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.760
Why don't you just tell me who you are?

20:31.880 --> 20:33.410
It's you, isn't it?

20:33.520 --> 20:34.680
It's Frank Morgan.

20:34.770 --> 20:37.240
I told you there were three things you have to do.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.340
You're on your way to doing the first thing.

20:39.450 --> 20:41.520
Now I need you to do the second thing.

20:41.620 --> 20:42.860
And what's the second thing?

20:42.960 --> 20:44.180
The second thing?

20:44.280 --> 20:45.620
-You gotta duck.
-What?

20:45.700 --> 20:47.270
Just duck!

20:57.390 --> 20:58.990
enter!

20:59.120 --> 21:01.250
I can't get the Hyde police department on the phone.

21:01.350 --> 21:03.210
It just rings and rings and rings.

21:03.310 --> 21:07.580
That's because the entire Hyde police force is comprised of one fat man

21:07.660 --> 21:09.250
and a Doberman pinscher.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.540
So what do we do?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.850
Well, what we shouldn't do is start jumping to conclusions

21:12.980 --> 21:16.010
that just 'cause no-nuts thinks all roads lead to Hyde,

21:16.110 --> 21:17.340
that all roads lead to Hyde.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.540
I'm telling you, Sam is in Hyde.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.230
Tell us why you're telling us.

21:21.330 --> 21:22.650
what, didn't you know?

21:22.780 --> 21:24.740
Her and the spaceman have a connection.

21:24.830 --> 21:26.510
They're, uh, what do you call?

21:26.600 --> 21:28.340
Kindred spirits.

21:28.430 --> 21:33.110
No-nuts burns herself on the stove, and Tyler winces two towns over, right,no-nuts?

21:33.200 --> 21:35.100
-Not at all.
-Aw, please!

21:35.190 --> 21:36.750
They're in love.

21:36.870 --> 21:40.180
Tyler burps, and, uh, she looks at him like he's singing a melody.

21:40.270 --> 21:42.220
I mean, to me, the whole thing is nauseating.

21:42.290 --> 21:44.690
All right, all right.

21:46.340 --> 21:48.330
Is that true, Norris?

21:48.410 --> 21:49.720
No, sir.

21:49.820 --> 21:53.390
Then what makes you sure they're in Hyde?

21:53.490 --> 21:54.950
I know it, sir.

21:55.040 --> 21:56.860
I know it in my bones.

21:56.970 --> 21:59.190
They're in Hyde.

22:18.990 --> 22:19.740
where's the boy?

22:19.840 --> 22:21.140
I don't know!

22:22.640 --> 22:25.480
Vic'll kill me, I tell ya!

22:25.600 --> 22:26.640
It goes like this.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.170
If you don't tell me, I kill you.

22:29.260 --> 22:30.370
I'll kill you with my own bare hands.

22:30.480 --> 22:32.260
You know what an awful way that is to die?

22:32.320 --> 22:33.150
Beaten to death?

22:33.220 --> 22:34.910
Some say it's the worst. You know why?

22:35.050 --> 22:38.230
'Cause it really, really hurts.

22:42.380 --> 22:44.640
wait a minute. For God sakes, wait a minute.

22:44.720 --> 22:45.700
We got a boat.

22:45.780 --> 22:49.330
Vic wants to take his kid away, far away, on a boat.

22:49.420 --> 22:50.610
You wanna take a trip? You wanna go far away?

22:50.690 --> 22:53.170
Then mommy-- she'll come meet us. We'll have a real good time.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.600
You sure you're a cop?

22:54.700 --> 22:57.120
'Cause you look like an astronaut.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.900
Where's the boat?

23:28.790 --> 23:30.170
Sammy.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.530
How you doing, kid?

23:31.620 --> 23:33.140
I miss my mommy.

23:33.220 --> 23:34.540
You know what?

23:34.640 --> 23:36.770
I got somethin' for you.

23:38.310 --> 23:39.840
From mommy.

23:39.950 --> 23:42.690
So you play with that, and I'll be right back, okay?

23:42.770 --> 23:44.270
Don't move.

24:01.850 --> 24:05.050
Oh,man, I swear to god, there's a nuclear war,

24:05.130 --> 24:09.440
and all humanity is wiped out, it's just gonna be you and the cockroaches.

24:09.500 --> 24:11.540
What are your thoughts on that, huh?

24:11.630 --> 24:15.240
You like being the king of the cockroaches, Sam?

24:21.730 --> 24:23.260
I'm taking you in, Vic.

24:23.340 --> 24:25.660
yeah. No, that's not gonna happen.

24:25.740 --> 24:28.340
You see, me and Sammy-- we're gonna get out of dodge for a while,

24:28.460 --> 24:30.160
let the new operation take hold.

24:30.260 --> 24:34.760
And then we're gonna cruise back here-- father and son--

24:34.890 --> 24:40.740
and we're gonna eat all the butter and eggs in New York city.

24:40.850 --> 24:44.450
That little boy in there-- he worships you.

24:44.530 --> 24:46.510
He thinks you're heroic, Vic.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.040
But he also senses something else.

24:49.140 --> 24:51.100
He can find the words.

24:51.170 --> 24:54.590
But he recognizes the darkness inside of you.

24:54.680 --> 24:57.880
He's terrified of it.

24:58.120 --> 25:00.440
But you know what the really bad news is for you right now?

25:00.530 --> 25:01.410
No.

25:01.530 --> 25:03.500
Why don't you tell me?

25:03.600 --> 25:05.610
I'm not.

25:08.110 --> 25:12.170
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Vic.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.540
And I sure as hell don't think you're heroic!

26:04.650 --> 26:06.340
last chance, detective.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.530
you wanna come work with me now?

26:09.960 --> 26:11.620
you can't do this, Vic.

26:11.710 --> 26:13.530
Why not?!

26:13.740 --> 26:18.970
Because-- because I'm your son.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.230
I know you are.

26:45.180 --> 26:46.780
dad?

26:52.820 --> 26:54.520
how did you know where to find me?

26:54.600 --> 26:59.000
No-nuts here is becoming a regular Columbo.

26:59.630 --> 27:01.220
you okay, Tyler?

27:01.400 --> 27:02.390
yeah.

27:12.070 --> 27:13.960
thanks, Gene.

27:33.840 --> 27:34.920
oh, Sammy!

27:35.040 --> 27:36.430
Mommy!

27:36.580 --> 27:37.890
Sammy!

27:44.860 --> 27:47.470
I'm sorry about Vic.

27:47.570 --> 27:50.490
He went wrong a long time ago.

27:50.620 --> 27:53.820
I just refused to see it.

27:53.980 --> 27:57.480
at least now he can't poison my little boy.

27:57.580 --> 27:58.930
Well, I told you, when you're gray and old,

27:59.010 --> 28:03.920
Sam's gonna read to you from Gulliver's travels.

28:16.560 --> 28:20.340
by the way, my name isn't Luke Skywalker.

28:20.440 --> 28:21.480
It's not?

28:21.580 --> 28:23.430
No.

28:23.550 --> 28:25.880
It's Sam.

28:26.360 --> 28:29.080
It's Sam Tyler.

28:48.710 --> 28:50.680
enter!

29:03.040 --> 29:04.550
you wanted to see me, sir?

29:04.650 --> 29:06.430
I did.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.840
I have given this a lot of thought, Norris.

29:10.950 --> 29:12.630
And it pains me to have to say it,

29:12.710 --> 29:15.650
but I do think you are no longer worthy of this badge.

29:15.730 --> 29:17.450
Sir--

29:17.590 --> 29:19.960
you're not.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.560
you are worthy of this one.

29:26.650 --> 29:29.550
And I'm promoting you to detective.

29:33.550 --> 29:35.590
thank you, sir.

29:35.680 --> 29:37.050
Ray.

29:37.130 --> 29:41.640
Would you like to inform her of the new moniker?

29:43.020 --> 29:44.810
come on, Ray.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.320
Hey-ah-hut!

29:49.010 --> 29:51.680
"No more no-nuts" Norris.

29:51.780 --> 29:53.340
Yes, indeed.

29:53.430 --> 29:56.940
Detective third grade "no more no-nuts" Norris.

29:57.050 --> 29:58.270
thank you, sir!

29:58.370 --> 29:59.850
Thank you.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.220
Sam...

30:14.660 --> 30:17.440
you sure you're okay?

30:18.250 --> 30:21.240
I don't know, Chris.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.830
I don't know why things happen the way they do.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.140
Do you?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.800
It goes like this, spaceman.

30:32.910 --> 30:34.460
We live on a rock.

30:34.560 --> 30:35.610
There ain't no rhyme.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.480
There ain't no reason.

30:36.550 --> 30:41.360
We live on a rock-- just one of many hurtling around in some big cosmic jambalaya.

30:41.430 --> 30:44.510
Now you want to get question-y, that's your prerogative.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.380
-Ray, not now.
-He-- unh-unH.

30:46.470 --> 30:49.960
My ma took me to a big, loud church every Sunday.

30:50.050 --> 30:51.610
She squeezed her eyes shut,

30:51.680 --> 30:53.490
she pressed her rosary beads to her lips,

30:53.560 --> 30:56.460
and she prayed for good things for those she loved.

30:56.530 --> 30:59.650
But cancer took two of her sisters.

30:59.730 --> 31:02.030
Her husband couldn't make a move without a bellyful of gin.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.960
Her youngest son turned to a life of crime.

31:04.080 --> 31:10.230
And her oldest--me-- is a nasty son of a bitch who can't get out of third gear without a snarl.

31:10.310 --> 31:15.790
So who was she talking to every Sunday, and why wasn't he answering?

31:15.880 --> 31:17.270
I will tell you why.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.910
Because we live on a rock, just one of many.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.580
There ain't no answers.

31:21.670 --> 31:23.210
There's just this.

31:23.280 --> 31:26.660
And all you can really hope to do is find a couple of people

31:26.760 --> 31:37.410
who will make the 70 or 80-odd years we get to live on this sweet, swingin' sphere remotely tolerable.

31:37.490 --> 31:40.010
I gotta take a leak.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.300
What he said.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.830
2-b, listen to this.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.300
Okay, so that party that I was telling you about-- the one in Soho--

31:54.410 --> 31:56.170
yeah, well, David Bowie was there.

31:56.230 --> 32:00.420
And he asked me to move to Spain with him and raise praying mantises.

32:00.500 --> 32:02.270
David Bowie.

32:02.370 --> 32:04.090
Why does it always come back to David Bowie?

32:04.160 --> 32:08.310
do you really think that Eric Clapton is God, like the bumper stickers say?

32:08.380 --> 32:10.010
I mean, I really hope so.

32:10.080 --> 32:11.790
It would make the world a safer place.

32:11.860 --> 32:12.760
Don't you think, 2-b?

32:12.830 --> 32:15.320
I mean, everybody worshiping rock 'n' roll?

32:15.390 --> 32:17.430
I could be like, okay, let's see...

32:17.500 --> 32:20.780
"they made signs for me to come down from the rock" and go towards the shore,

32:20.850 --> 32:22.460
which I accordingly did

32:22.540 --> 32:25.180
and the flying island being raised to a convenient height,

32:25.270 --> 32:26.500
the verge directly over me.

32:26.570 --> 32:29.650
We should let her get some rest.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.110
Okay.

32:31.220 --> 32:32.650
thanks, Ellen.

32:32.740 --> 32:34.050
Gulliver's travels.

32:34.130 --> 32:35.270
I love that book.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.940
Yeah, I used to read it to my mother before she passed away.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.230
So it's time to go.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.370
We'll finish this tomorrow night.

32:44.470 --> 32:49.320
It'll be new year' 2010.

32:49.400 --> 32:53.660
It's gonna be a heck of a year, don't you think?

32:54.100 --> 32:56.220
I'll see you tomorrow

32:59.700 --> 33:02.500
sleep tight, Annie.

33:13.370 --> 33:16.340
go to her, 2-B.

33:17.600 --> 33:18.990
You saw that?

33:19.090 --> 33:21.310
Of course, 2-B.

33:21.390 --> 33:24.080
I see everything you see.

33:24.160 --> 33:26.380
Always have.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.330
Now, go to her.

33:34.670 --> 33:37.220
she is the one

33:49.340 --> 33:50.830
Hey

33:50.990 --> 33:52.790
Sam, what are you doing here?

33:52.860 --> 33:55.960
I am gonna know you for a long, long time

33:56.060 --> 33:58.520
I am gonna know you forever.

33:58.670 --> 34:03.760
somehow, some way, and I think that maybe all of this

34:03.860 --> 34:06.830
every single bit of this madness

34:06.930 --> 34:10.730
has only ever been about one thing

34:11.050 --> 34:13.310
what one thing, Sam?

34:13.409 --> 34:16.730
this one thing

34:32.699 --> 34:39.530
Sam, if-if that's true

34:39.670 --> 34:45.179
-then
-then what?

34:47.210 --> 34:51.679
welcome to 1973.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.940
spaceman...

35:12.170 --> 35:16.440
Chris and I are headed to the snug to attempt to drink up all the salty margaritas in Manhattan.

35:16.540 --> 35:17.200
You in?

35:17.280 --> 35:18.690
Yeah, I don't think so, Ray.

35:18.780 --> 35:19.600
Long day.

35:19.700 --> 35:23.460
come on, Sam, Ray wants to talk about the decline of Richard Nixon and

35:23.520 --> 35:25.560
the death of hope. I'm gonna need backup.

35:25.780 --> 35:27.660
Okay, I'll meet you there.

35:27.730 --> 35:28.470
all right.

35:46.950 --> 35:47.920
what?

35:48.010 --> 35:52.460
I said there were three things you needed to do if you want to go home, Sam.

35:52.540 --> 35:53.290
Three.

35:53.350 --> 35:56.880
Are you ready for the third?

35:59.840 --> 36:04.420
One more thing, and then you are home, Sam.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.120
You know what, pal?

36:06.190 --> 36:09.330
Maybe I don't want to go home so badly anymore.

36:09.420 --> 36:11.720
What do you think of that, huh?

36:11.810 --> 36:14.270
'Cause I like 1973...

36:14.370 --> 36:16.300
and everybody in it.

36:16.360 --> 36:19.760
And because, a long time ago, someone I loved once told me

36:19.840 --> 36:25.980
that whichever strange place you find yourself in, make that your home.

36:28.530 --> 36:32.040
Tyler, I need to talk to you.

36:42.780 --> 36:47.260
I think I'll miss you most of all, scarecrow.

36:54.900 --> 36:55.660
we're losing him.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.410
Heart rate's dropping.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.210
-clear. -Clear?

36:58.980 --> 37:00.990
the way I figure, I'm in a coma somewhere...

37:01.070 --> 37:03.160
or on a very intense drug trip.

37:03.230 --> 37:04.280
how can you just stand there

37:04.360 --> 37:07.390
and insist that this is some puppet show that's being performed in your head?

37:07.440 --> 37:09.780
I don't know what's real anymore.

37:09.850 --> 37:11.180
I gotta say good-bye.

37:11.240 --> 37:12.450
I gotta let you go.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.900
-terminating synaptic twirl network.
-so long, Sam. You're a good cop.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.470
-returning to normal.
-we'll miss you, Sam.

37:16.560 --> 37:19.560
Vital signs are within normal range.

37:19.650 --> 37:22.840
2-b is awake.

37:38.220 --> 37:40.480
2-a, 1-B...

37:40.560 --> 37:43.590
3-b are awake.

37:43.710 --> 37:47.000
Homeostatic functions returning to normal.

37:47.080 --> 37:50.310
w-1-n-d coming online.

37:50.380 --> 37:51.050
hey, Windy.

37:51.140 --> 37:52.550
Hello, 2-B.

37:52.660 --> 37:56.440
The date--2 March 2035.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.110
St. Christopher medals seemed to work, huh?

37:59.220 --> 38:00.020
I guess they did.

38:00.110 --> 38:03.730
Martian surface deployment initialized.

38:06.560 --> 38:08.210
hello, Sam.

38:08.410 --> 38:09.160
Colonel Norris.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.390
Welcome to Mars.

38:12.130 --> 38:14.090
We made it.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.160
Yes, we did.

38:15.260 --> 38:20.010
elapsed travel is two years, 3 months and 22 days.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.360
Spaceman.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.150
You miss me?

38:23.730 --> 38:26.030
ground control to Hyde 1-2-5.

38:26.120 --> 38:27.400
Uplink requested.

38:27.490 --> 38:30.280
Video uplink connected.

38:30.740 --> 38:32.890
there you are, you sons of guns.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.370
Ah, it's great to have you back.

38:34.450 --> 38:36.170
Congratulations, colonel Norris.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.770
Your crew is cleared for touchdown.

38:37.850 --> 38:38.870
By the way, colonel,

38:38.970 --> 38:42.940
president Obama really wanted to be in the control room when you landed,

38:43.070 --> 38:48.900
but her father is seriously ill, so she and her sister went to Chicago to be by his side.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.780
Well, send them our best.

38:50.870 --> 38:52.460
Yeah, you got it.

38:52.530 --> 38:57.240
Hey, Chris, where did colonel Norris and her goofy boyfriend leave it when we took off?

38:57.320 --> 38:58.980
I don't know. Why?

38:59.080 --> 39:03.660
'Cause I think this mission to mars just got a whole lot more complicated.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.670
Morgan, we need to talk.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.720
What did you do to me?

39:07.810 --> 39:09.310
My trip got...

39:09.410 --> 39:10.270
trippy.

39:10.350 --> 39:13.460
Well, the ship ran into a meteor storm, but with w1n-d's help,

39:13.550 --> 39:17.610
we were able to keep all life support and navigation systems within range,

39:17.710 --> 39:22.270
but there may have been some glitches in your neural stimulation program.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.040
Glitches?

39:23.130 --> 39:27.700
I still don't understand why you chose the neural-stim to make you a cop in 2008.

39:27.770 --> 39:35.750
Yeah, well, those glitches knocked me back to 1973 with all my 2008 memories intact.

39:35.830 --> 39:37.390
I nearly went crazy.

39:37.490 --> 39:38.970
And you guys were all there.

39:39.050 --> 39:42.110
I mean, you were different, but you were a there.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.650
oh, you poor bastard.

39:43.740 --> 39:47.000
For my neural-stim, I was on a deserted island with 200 girls

39:47.090 --> 39:52.010
who all looked like either "splash"-era Daryl Hannah or "scarface"-era Michelle Pfeiffer.

39:52.110 --> 39:52.940
And let me guess.

39:53.040 --> 39:54.600
There were no other men on this island.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.850
No, there were, but they didn't have penises.

39:56.930 --> 39:58.550
Maybe you weren't that different after all.

39:58.630 --> 40:00.900
Hey, I fell in love on my island.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.160
Yeah?

40:02.360 --> 40:05.380
I fell in love on my island, too.

40:05.500 --> 40:06.960
It's the freakiest show, spaceman.

40:07.060 --> 40:11.440
"Hyde 1-2-5," deployment activation beginning.

40:11.570 --> 40:13.410
It's pretty crazy down here.

40:13.530 --> 40:15.010
You guys are heroes.

40:15.110 --> 40:18.950
Now if you manage to find genetic DNA  and a cure for cancer,

40:19.050 --> 40:26.080
well-- we will find genetic DNA, Frank, and this will be one successful gene hunt.

40:26.200 --> 40:28.810
1-a, away.

40:29.460 --> 40:30.480
there he is.

40:30.590 --> 40:32.740
Major Tom, how'd you sleep?

40:32.860 --> 40:35.190
Like a drunk baby.

40:37.120 --> 40:39.700
Frank, you look like hell.

40:39.810 --> 40:41.560
I love you, too.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.090
Windy, what's going on, sugar?

40:44.190 --> 40:46.000
I missed you, major Tom.

40:46.100 --> 40:47.720
They all do.

41:00.580 --> 41:04.220
so, uh, before we do this...

41:04.310 --> 41:09.650
amazing thing, I just wanted to say that, uh...

41:09.740 --> 41:12.680
I really don't want to fight with you anymore...

41:12.770 --> 41:15.300
dad.

41:18.430 --> 41:21.050
Life is good, kiddo.

41:21.150 --> 41:24.800
It's like I've been telling you since you were a little boy--

41:24.910 --> 41:33.810
whichever strange place you land in, make that your home.

41:49.450 --> 41:52.450
