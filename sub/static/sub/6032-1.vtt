01:02.008 --> 01:04.462
In El Paso, Texas today...

01:08.883 --> 01:10.507
The historical presidential...

01:10.592 --> 01:12.500
motorcade marks the first time

01:12.592 --> 01:15.875
within a generation a president
has set out across the country--

01:50.842 --> 01:53.675
Copy. HP, go to Channel Three.

02:01.133 --> 02:02.841
Hey, this is Nico.

02:27.092 --> 02:29.130
The street's secure and chief in sight.

02:37.008 --> 02:38.834
Check.

02:46.383 --> 02:47.842
Plaza secure.

03:45.175 --> 03:48.174
Can you hear me?

04:05.467 --> 04:09.165
Can you hear me?

04:32.300 --> 04:37.670
Hear me. Try to open your eyes.

04:39.050 --> 04:40.876
Can you hear me?

04:48.925 --> 04:52.374
Can you hear me?

04:58.592 --> 05:00.630
You're gonna be just fine.

05:01.842 --> 05:04.296
You're gonna be just fine.

05:07.592 --> 05:10.757
So, Doc.
What's the word on our John Doe?

05:10.842 --> 05:13.675
Trauma to the right parieto-occipital
sulcus and parietal lobe.

05:13.758 --> 05:15.252
In English, por favor.

05:15.342 --> 05:18.424
The bullet ricocheted off the skull
and missed his brain. He's in a coma.

05:18.842 --> 05:20.750
So he's out, but physically he's okay?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.668
We, he's not gonna play eighteen
holes of golf, Jack.

05:22.758 --> 05:24.335
He's in a coma. He may never come to.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.796
Well, what are his chances?
Give me a number.

05:26.883 --> 05:28.377
Well, fifty percent total recovery.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.795
Thirty-five percent partial.

05:29.883 --> 05:32.041
Fifteen percent you can plant him
in the ground and watch him grow.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.627
But we may have to move him to
Albuquerque.

05:33.717 --> 05:34.630
Now, hold a minute.

05:34.717 --> 05:36.874
I don't want this guy playing
zombie up at Albuquerque

05:36.967 --> 05:39.373
while we got a murderer
running around here.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.466
Now, you do whatever it takes
to snap his ass back to reality.

05:42.550 --> 05:46.248
Pronto. You call me the minute he breaks.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.041
Jack. All I got out here is this damn hat.

05:53.133 --> 05:55.623
Don't let anyone touch that hat, Shirl.

05:55.717 --> 05:58.917
I need to get prints.

05:59.008 --> 06:01.498
Expand the perimeter another
hundred yards.

06:01.592 --> 06:03.749
Sift through every little grain of sand.

06:03.842 --> 06:06.841
You know, evidence has a way of
disappearing right quick out there.

06:06.925 --> 06:08.668
And I know how you like forensic.

06:08.758 --> 06:10.169
I know how you good you are with it

06:10.258 --> 06:12.582
and I know you know
it's the coming thing.

06:12.675 --> 06:15.342
We'll check this thing from ass to appetite.

06:15.425 --> 06:17.464
Okay, the doc's here. I gotta go.

06:39.092 --> 06:41.332
Mind if I smoke?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.587
You know what I'm gonna do one day?

06:59.550 --> 07:01.341
I'm gonna go traveling.

07:06.633 --> 07:08.921
You ever been in New Guinea?

07:10.467 --> 07:12.174
How about Africa?

07:30.633 --> 07:31.914
Spain.

07:35.383 --> 07:36.842
That'd be nice.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.091
Have a real good day.

07:51.133 --> 07:54.085
Maybe if you get better I'll take
you to one of those bullfights.

09:04.800 --> 09:10.003
Oh. Rio. That's where we're going.

09:22.550 --> 09:25.798
Sir? Sir....

09:25.883 --> 09:27.922
excuse me, you need to-

09:32.300 --> 09:34.043
I've got no comment. Christ.

09:34.133 --> 09:37.749
That's all we need is a bunch of
Albuquerque reporters stirring shit up.

09:38.050 --> 09:40.456
I don't want the town to get excited
about this guy.

09:40.550 --> 09:42.791
Don't worry about it. I'll brief 'em.

09:43.508 --> 09:46.507
Yeah. But you guys have to promise
me no more than five minutes.

09:46.592 --> 09:47.872
Promise.

09:49.842 --> 09:53.504
Sir?

09:53.592 --> 09:54.754
This is Sheriff--

09:54.842 --> 09:58.504
Sheriff Kolb. You can call me Jack.

09:58.592 --> 10:01.875
It's a small town. This is my deputy.

10:01.967 --> 10:05.914
Shirl Cash. Have you got a name, son?

10:10.217 --> 10:13.299
Say, you wouldn't happen to know...

10:13.383 --> 10:15.671
who might have done this to you,
do you?

10:16.800 --> 10:17.963
Is he hearing me?

10:18.050 --> 10:19.213
He was responding.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.165
I can hear. I can hear you fine.

10:23.258 --> 10:25.084
I just wondered if I knew you.

10:25.175 --> 10:26.338
If you knew me, no.

10:26.425 --> 10:28.582
We, I mean, we stopped by
the room here when you admitted,

10:28.675 --> 10:30.880
but you were unconscious at the time.

10:31.092 --> 10:41.249
You're the sheriff of, she said,
it was, b-, it was bI-. Black Hole.

10:41.342 --> 10:42.586
Black Point.

10:42.675 --> 10:44.169
Black Hole's close enough.

10:44.508 --> 10:45.671
And, uh...Sheriff,

10:46.675 --> 10:49.544
Sheriff Jack, could you tell me-.

10:55.758 --> 10:57.501
Do you know who I am?

10:57.592 --> 11:00.840
Do I know who you are? Well, no.

11:00.925 --> 11:03.461
I was hoping you'd be able to tell me that.

11:03.842 --> 11:07.422
See, we didn't, didn't find any I.D.
You wallet was probably lifted.

11:07.508 --> 11:10.128
In fact, all we found was this.

11:10.342 --> 11:12.961
Rhombus?
Does that mean anything to you?

11:14.425 --> 11:18.123
Tried calling it, but it was a pager
of some sort. No?

11:19.675 --> 11:21.418
Well, what about this?

11:21.508 --> 11:22.836
This, you recognize that?

11:22.925 --> 11:23.921
It's a hat.

11:24.008 --> 11:28.085
It is. Old Man Grant down at the
convenience store said a stranger

11:28.175 --> 11:31.008
bought one just like it and used
his ATM machine.

11:31.092 --> 11:33.462
Does any of that ring a bell with you?

11:34.758 --> 11:36.715
Just old hat.

11:39.258 --> 11:42.341
Well, it looks like we just gotta
get stuck into it

11:42.425 --> 11:46.336
and watch us a lotta ATM
footage see if something shows up.

11:46.425 --> 11:47.421
Yep.

11:47.508 --> 11:49.915
Now, if, uh,
anything does come back to you,

11:50.008 --> 11:51.881
you give us a holler, all...right?

11:54.842 --> 11:56.999
Oh there was, is there an accident?

11:57.092 --> 12:01.252
A really big accident.

12:01.342 --> 12:05.502
Okay, well, I thing Mister Smith
has had about enough for one night.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.465
So why don't we just go?

12:08.342 --> 12:10.001
Jell-O. If you, if I could have some...

12:10.092 --> 12:12.249
red Jell-O, that would be good.

12:12.342 --> 12:14.215
Shirl, come on.

12:15.008 --> 12:20.508
Uh, yeah, do-, good luck to you.

12:20.592 --> 12:21.422
Thank you, Deputy.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.879
Get this man some Jell-O, would you?

12:40.425 --> 12:43.459
Find anything out there when you
extended the perimeter today?

12:43.550 --> 12:45.921
No, not a damn thing.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.211
How do you suppose those gossip
columnists got wind of this.

12:52.300 --> 12:53.842
What are you talking about?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.541
The election's a week away

12:56.633 --> 13:00.130
and there just happened to be a whole
bunch of reporters there that you brief.

13:00.217 --> 13:01.794
What are you saying, Jack?

13:01.883 --> 13:03.211
I wouldn't do something like that.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.296
Jesus, Christ.

13:04.383 --> 13:05.877
You and I have been together
a lot of years

13:05.967 --> 13:09.001
and I don't want to win no
goddamned election that way.

13:10.050 --> 13:10.964
What's that old saying,

13:11.050 --> 13:13.089
why fuck a stranger
when you can fuck a friend?

13:15.217 --> 13:18.548
How come our American flag
wasn't flying today?

13:18.633 --> 13:20.044
American flag is not flying.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.374
I really don't know, Jack.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.293
I g-, I guess it's jammed up somewhere.

13:24.383 --> 13:25.628
I just don't really know.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.175
I'll take a look at it.

13:27.300 --> 13:28.842
You do that.

13:37.008 --> 13:40.126
Pick me up tomorrow
and we'll go check that perimeter again.

13:47.675 --> 13:49.466
Smells like rain.

14:09.592 --> 14:10.706
Are you fine with this?

14:14.758 --> 14:15.956
You and two others.

14:16.592 --> 14:21.001
Half up, half at completion.

14:23.383 --> 14:25.422
Go word is Rhombus.

14:38.800 --> 14:39.796
Hey.

14:39.883 --> 14:41.128
Come on.

14:41.217 --> 14:43.422
Doctor will kill me if he sees you up.

14:50.383 --> 14:54.081
So, Nurse.

14:55.467 --> 14:56.167
Liz.

14:56.258 --> 14:57.717
Nurse Liz.

14:57.925 --> 15:01.457
So you take care of people.
Who takes care of you?

15:03.425 --> 15:05.049
Good question.

15:07.092 --> 15:10.873
Your brother. You have a brother?

15:11.425 --> 15:14.708
Yeah, I have a brother. Logan.

15:16.175 --> 15:18.878
What's the first thing you
remember about him?

15:19.508 --> 15:22.756
He was demonstrating
how pro wrestling was fake

15:22.842 --> 15:25.710
and he threw me up against
the TV set.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.508
I got nine stitches.
See, there's a scar right there.

15:29.592 --> 15:30.505
You have a scar?

15:30.592 --> 15:32.465
Yeah, right there.

15:44.175 --> 15:45.834
I gotta go, I-.

15:45.925 --> 15:48.710
I think I'll come back later for this.

15:57.842 --> 16:00.545
You know, I told you there wasn't
nothin' out here.

16:00.758 --> 16:03.793
I tried to take some
impressions in the sand.

16:04.008 --> 16:06.628
Hell, you can't take impressions
of nothin' there.

16:14.925 --> 16:16.549
Here you go. Check that out.

16:16.633 --> 16:19.833
Yeah, I better check that out.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.625
The president's
motorcade completed its swing...

16:29.717 --> 16:32.467
through the Southwest today,
traveling through Central Texas.

16:32.550 --> 16:35.122
Strategists see this push to solidify
support in these...

16:35.217 --> 16:38.915
hotly-contested border states
as a brilliant counter-move against...

16:39.008 --> 16:43.548
Republican candidate
Bill Gable's media blitz in the past week.

16:43.925 --> 16:47.090
Polls show the president's
lead continuing to build by this...

16:47.175 --> 16:50.091
recent about face on illegal immigration.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.629
The president's motorcade-.

17:18.258 --> 17:19.800
I have a right to make a phone call.

17:19.883 --> 17:21.342
- I will call the orderlies.
- No. Doctor, please.

17:21.425 --> 17:23.251
Right now! You get in that bed!

17:24.133 --> 17:25.544
I can't believe you would say that.

17:25.633 --> 17:27.127
All right, come on. Go for it.

17:27.217 --> 17:29.090
All right, all right. Take it easy.

17:29.175 --> 17:30.669
What the hell's wrong with you?

17:30.758 --> 17:32.418
He is crazy. I swear-.

17:32.592 --> 17:33.920
Now, take it easy.

17:34.008 --> 17:35.917
There's this conspiracy to kill
the president of the United States...

17:36.008 --> 17:37.751
and I know something about it.
I don't know how I know.

17:37.842 --> 17:40.841
But it's happening in your town, Sheriff.
What are you going to do about it?

17:40.925 --> 17:42.253
He's crazy!

17:42.342 --> 17:45.175
What, this town is like a....
wide spot in the road.

17:45.258 --> 17:46.752
What the hell's the president
got to do with it?

17:46.842 --> 17:48.170
I don't know.

17:48.258 --> 17:50.333
Why, was I shot?

17:50.425 --> 17:52.381
I have no idea.

18:02.092 --> 18:04.167
He said it was his key all right.

18:04.258 --> 18:06.215
Well, let's give it a whirl.

18:07.008 --> 18:11.548
With projected to win...
the Labor Party leader conceded to-.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.675
Yeah.

18:45.633 --> 18:46.713
Don't touch that.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.550
Oh, sure.
I ain't gonna let nobody touch it.

19:04.675 --> 19:05.873
Can I help you?

19:08.008 --> 19:08.791
Who are you?

19:10.258 --> 19:12.629
I'm Chloe, Chloe Richards. Why?

19:15.842 --> 19:17.715
It's Frank, isn't it?

19:19.258 --> 19:21.464
We were f-fighting the last time
we saw each other.

19:21.550 --> 19:24.040
That's why he left because, you know,
he takes off sometimes.

19:24.133 --> 19:26.042
He doesn't like confrontation.

19:26.133 --> 19:28.291
So-. It's all right.

19:28.383 --> 19:31.299
Doc? This is Miss Richards.

19:31.383 --> 19:33.541
She seems to know our mystery man.

19:33.633 --> 19:35.293
He's, he's not remembering
anything at all?

19:35.383 --> 19:37.754
Well, how to throw a punch.

19:37.883 --> 19:38.879
Miss Richards?

19:38.967 --> 19:42.713
Does Frank work for the government
in any capacity, as far as you know?

19:42.800 --> 19:45.372
Yeah, he's a supervisor for the
IRS in Chicago.

19:45.467 --> 19:46.711
The IRS?

19:47.175 --> 19:50.838
Well, I know, he was just having
some nightmares before and-.

19:50.925 --> 19:54.623
Probably best to play along,
keep him positive for the moment.

19:55.175 --> 19:58.423
All right. Just-?

20:00.300 --> 20:02.043
Can I see him by myself for a minute?

20:02.133 --> 20:02.964
Oh, sure.

20:03.050 --> 20:05.338
One, one minute.

20:06.550 --> 20:08.672
You got a visitor.

20:20.467 --> 20:22.008
Hi, Frank.

20:22.217 --> 20:25.002
Frank? You called me Frank?

20:25.383 --> 20:29.248
That's your name. Frank Kavanaugh.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.875
Franklin Thomas Kavanaugh.

20:31.967 --> 20:35.629
Uh, Maybe you have the wrong room?

20:35.717 --> 20:37.341
No.

20:41.300 --> 20:43.339
No. You-.

20:44.133 --> 20:46.255
You don't remember me?

20:53.467 --> 20:55.174
No.

20:56.717 --> 21:04.919
That's o-. I'm, Chloe, your fiance.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.716
I'm really sorry. I don't f-, I don't-.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.128
It's, it's okay.

21:11.217 --> 21:13.920
I don't remember you.

21:43.217 --> 21:44.461
United States Secret Service.

21:44.550 --> 21:46.044
I'd like to report a possible threat
to the president.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.296
What department, sir?

21:47.383 --> 21:49.292
I would like to report a threat
to the president.

21:49.383 --> 21:51.589
I don't know what department.
The Threat to the president Department.

21:51.675 --> 21:52.754
Are you making a threat, sir?

21:52.842 --> 21:54.335
No, I'm not a, I'm not threatening.

21:54.425 --> 21:56.002
I'm a, I'm warning.

21:56.092 --> 21:58.795
- What is your name and your location?
- Please, I don't, it doesn't matter.

21:58.883 --> 22:01.005
- What's your name, sir?
- My name is Frank.

22:01.092 --> 22:01.507
Last name, sir?

22:02.717 --> 22:04.625
Kavanaugh.

22:04.717 --> 22:05.879
What's your occupation?

22:05.967 --> 22:08.456
I don't know. What do I do? Is-?

22:08.550 --> 22:10.341
- You work for the IRS.
- I work for the IRS.

22:10.425 --> 22:12.084
Thank you, sir.
I'm gonna have to put you on hold.

22:12.175 --> 22:15.672
Please don't put me on hold.
This is, please, please, le-.

22:42.217 --> 22:43.924
Rhombus.

22:49.800 --> 22:50.831
What was that?

22:52.633 --> 22:53.748
I don't know.

22:54.383 --> 22:55.794
You don't know who you were calling?

22:55.883 --> 22:57.258
Standard encryption.

22:59.133 --> 23:00.213
Voice activated.

23:01.592 --> 23:03.465
I think it's a page.

23:03.842 --> 23:05.252
Frank...what are you doing?

23:05.342 --> 23:06.883
Will you get back in bed?

23:18.258 --> 23:21.458
Does he know what happened to him?

23:21.550 --> 23:24.750
Well, actually, he's kind of off the wall.

23:42.717 --> 23:45.383
What if there's some truth to
what he's telling us?

23:45.467 --> 23:51.002
Uh, people with memory loss often
overcompensate for what we call...

23:51.092 --> 23:52.669
the memory vacuum.

23:52.758 --> 23:56.835
Their minds fill in the gaps in order
to create a comfort-based reality.

23:56.925 --> 23:59.166
If they can't remember
what they did for a living,

23:59.258 --> 24:01.001
they can conveniently create one.

24:01.092 --> 24:04.423
They were a, a football player...
or a cop or-.

24:04.508 --> 24:05.422
Secret agent?

24:05.508 --> 24:06.588
Jack, exactly.

24:06.675 --> 24:10.255
It could be the last movie he saw
or book he read in the eighth grade.

24:10.342 --> 24:13.376
The mind is an unpredictable machine.

24:33.092 --> 24:37.252
There's absolutely nothing....
suspicious in that transaction.

24:37.342 --> 24:42.545
Yeah, well. Somethin'
will rear its ugly head sooner or later.

24:46.508 --> 24:48.500
Memory loss is a tricky thing.

24:48.592 --> 24:52.752
When it returns, if it returns,
it usually starts with flashes...

24:52.842 --> 24:54.668
and comes on in a flood.

24:54.758 --> 24:56.667
Of course, there can be side effects.

24:56.758 --> 24:58.086
Side effects.

24:58.175 --> 25:01.340
Blackouts,
nausea varying degrees of tremors.

25:01.425 --> 25:02.919
But if you agree to take it easy...

25:03.008 --> 25:04.751
no traveling for a few days until...

25:04.842 --> 25:07.924
we're totally in the clear I see no
reason why he can't check outta here.

25:08.008 --> 25:09.550
Well, that's good news, isn't it?

25:10.425 --> 25:12.298
Just sign right here.

25:25.925 --> 25:30.216
Hi. I'm Frank.

25:33.008 --> 25:35.000
But I wear a suit to work.

25:38.383 --> 25:39.758
Are you happy?

25:40.717 --> 25:42.792
Possible side effects.

25:42.883 --> 25:45.089
There are people out there.

25:48.050 --> 25:49.793
There are people out there-.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.460
I haven't seen him before.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.257
Not quite myself.

26:01.133 --> 26:03.125
He's being released today.

26:04.008 --> 26:07.838
Don't worry. We'll find'em. Fine.

26:10.883 --> 26:12.046
All is one.

26:12.133 --> 26:13.675
Thank you.

26:16.550 --> 26:20.047
That's not-. That doctor was-.

26:20.133 --> 26:22.588
Probably just your nerves. It'll go away.

26:22.675 --> 26:25.875
Yeah. It's probably these shoes.

26:26.175 --> 26:27.550
Your favorites.

26:30.092 --> 26:31.633
You don't like 'em?

26:32.175 --> 26:33.966
They don't fit right.

26:34.175 --> 26:35.633
You don't have to wear them.

26:37.175 --> 26:38.834
I know-. I'm sorry.

26:38.925 --> 26:40.584
It's okay.
You want to wear your slippers?

26:40.675 --> 26:42.797
All right. I'm sorry.

26:43.925 --> 26:46.047
It's okay.

26:47.425 --> 26:48.883
There you go.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.631
Those will feel better.

26:55.258 --> 26:57.215
Hi, Sheriff.

26:58.092 --> 27:00.758
So, I hear the doc's gonna
let you take a walk, huh?

27:00.842 --> 27:01.921
Yeah.

27:02.008 --> 27:03.383
Well, let's get something clear,
you know, Frank.

27:03.467 --> 27:06.133
You're my only eye
witness to an attempted murder.

27:06.217 --> 27:07.876
You understand that, don't you?

27:07.967 --> 27:09.709
If any little thing starts coming
back to you...

27:09.800 --> 27:12.336
you know, you gotta,
I need to know about it.

27:12.550 --> 27:13.713
Of course.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.626
I mean, we can't allow you to
be leaving town.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.087
No, we know that. Yeah.

27:19.300 --> 27:22.085
We don't have any need for
this anymore.

27:22.175 --> 27:24.380
I thought maybe you could use it.

27:25.092 --> 27:28.174
Man shouldn't be without
a good hat in this country.

27:28.258 --> 27:31.506
Yeah. Stay in touch.
Now, you got my members.

27:31.592 --> 27:33.299
Thanks, Sheriff.

27:35.425 --> 27:37.132
Wanna go?

27:50.217 --> 27:52.374
We were on our way to Mexico, the ocean.

27:52.467 --> 27:55.039
Planned on spending some time
without your friends.

27:55.133 --> 27:57.421
So I have friends you don't like?

27:57.633 --> 28:00.502
No. I just wanted to have you to
myself for awhile.

28:02.717 --> 28:07.043
Mexico is a long way from Chicago.

28:07.133 --> 28:09.421
That's exactly...what I said.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.754
I don't want to go straight to the hotel.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.041
Frank, come on.
People don't just wait for accidents.

28:34.133 --> 28:36.090
That's why they're called accidents.

28:36.883 --> 28:38.922
Something's gonna happen.

28:40.550 --> 28:41.665
Right here.

28:42.383 --> 28:43.711
I feel it.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.420
Just let the sheriff do his job.

28:48.217 --> 28:49.959
This is not the sheriff's job.
There's some-.

28:50.550 --> 28:54.758
What if they know that I'm not dead?
What if they come back?

29:36.883 --> 29:38.922
Not exactly the lap of luxury.

29:51.467 --> 29:52.795
What are you doing?

29:56.092 --> 29:57.206
Nothing.

30:01.592 --> 30:04.164
You want something to drink,
some water or something?

30:11.800 --> 30:13.922
Does it jog any memories?

30:14.550 --> 30:17.632
Frank I mean, you remember
anything from the day you left?

30:19.842 --> 30:22.378
I was thinking maybe if I,

30:22.675 --> 30:28.542
showed you some pictures it might
help you in some way. Here.

30:31.925 --> 30:33.798
It's your medication.

30:38.342 --> 30:40.713
This is us with the gang.

30:40.925 --> 30:42.833
These are friends.

30:42.925 --> 30:45.130
That's Anne and Grant.

30:48.008 --> 30:50.628
You have a nice um, laugh.

30:51.675 --> 30:57.127
Thank you. This is us in, Costa Rica.

30:57.258 --> 30:58.503
Waterfall we found...

30:58.592 --> 31:00.832
when we were walking in a rainforest.

31:00.925 --> 31:03.047
It's gorgeous there.

31:04.425 --> 31:07.459
I remember you really like the monkeys.

31:32.842 --> 31:33.956
Hi, Tom.

31:34.675 --> 31:36.085
Hi, Jack.

31:36.175 --> 31:37.338
Whatchoo up to?

31:37.425 --> 31:39.216
What can I do for ya?

31:41.008 --> 31:42.965
Mind if I look at your register?

31:47.925 --> 31:50.047
- Thank you.
- What do you need?

31:51.508 --> 31:54.424
Do you know if a little skinny girl
came through here about six days ago?

31:54.508 --> 31:55.967
Black hair?

31:56.175 --> 32:00.668
Little. Pretty girl. Kinda skinny?

32:01.217 --> 32:04.085
I don't know
when she's come through here.

32:04.425 --> 32:05.255
Can't remember.

32:05.342 --> 32:08.127
There she is. Chloe.

32:13.592 --> 32:15.630
Missing yesterday's page?

32:17.592 --> 32:19.548
There's a page missing.

32:20.675 --> 32:21.838
Let's see.

32:21.925 --> 32:24.047
Well, son of a bitch.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.835
Just noticed that, huh?

32:25.925 --> 32:27.383
Yeah.

32:55.758 --> 32:57.382
United States Secret Service.

32:57.467 --> 32:59.505
Okay. You understand who we are?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.376
We know about your situation.

33:02.467 --> 33:05.217
We know what you said.
Can you explain it?

33:05.300 --> 33:06.628
Did you threaten the president?

33:06.717 --> 33:07.961
I didn't...threaten him.

33:08.050 --> 33:10.966
I'm here to warm him about the president.

33:11.050 --> 33:13.125
- He's in danger.
- From who and where?

33:13.217 --> 33:17.046
Well, there's a,
from someone...someplace.

33:17.133 --> 33:21.957
That's what we have to f-find
out...about.

33:22.050 --> 33:24.338
And th-, I... there are three men.

33:28.383 --> 33:33.207
And I...the three men, there's a...

33:33.300 --> 33:35.043
if you draw a circle around...

33:35.133 --> 33:38.879
wherever the president is,
and anyone that's different.

33:38.967 --> 33:40.295
Anyone new to the area.

33:40.383 --> 33:44.295
Any behavior that's odd
you've got to check out.

33:44.383 --> 33:46.375
So, I don't know how I know this.

33:46.467 --> 33:47.795
But I think how I know
is that the, because,

33:48.508 --> 33:51.673
because I've been fed
information by the IRS.

33:51.758 --> 33:53.335
The Internal Revenue Service?

33:53.425 --> 33:55.251
Yes, the IRS. I work for the IRS and,

33:55.467 --> 33:57.375
and we all know
that they know everything.

33:57.467 --> 33:58.546
Look, Mr. Kavanaugh.

33:58.633 --> 33:59.961
What you're saying is very serious.

34:00.050 --> 34:02.089
- Well, I, I know.
- It's a federal offense.

34:02.175 --> 34:05.838
I really get a strong, strong feeling
you guys aren't,

34:05.925 --> 34:09.208
aren't playing ball here.
We've got very little time.

34:09.592 --> 34:11.998
Technically, we can take you to jail
right now for what you've said.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.416
You can't turn th-,
you're trying to twist this.

34:14.507 --> 34:15.588
They're trying to...No, no.

34:15.675 --> 34:19.005
Frank. Look me in the eyes.

34:19.092 --> 34:21.960
Do you even know
the president's name?

34:27.175 --> 34:29.629
Very well, Mr. Kavanaugh.

34:31.257 --> 34:33.464
We'll take it under advisement.

34:42.842 --> 34:43.920
Well...

34:44.007 --> 34:46.379
I'm sorry, Frank. We tried.

34:47.757 --> 34:49.583
You believe that? God.

34:49.675 --> 34:51.217
Okay, I'm just gonna go do it myself.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.588
Where are you going?

35:05.883 --> 35:08.254
Oh, I hear that guy talks to ghosts.

35:08.342 --> 35:10.250
Yeah. They call him the man.

35:10.342 --> 35:14.206
He's in touch with the other side,
you know. I read about it.

35:14.508 --> 35:16.216
Thank you.

35:42.133 --> 35:42.916
Frank Kavanaugh.

35:43.008 --> 35:44.881
That's your name.

35:57.842 --> 35:59.419
Anyone that's different, anyone...

35:59.508 --> 36:02.294
new to the area, you've got to check out.

36:18.342 --> 36:19.800
I don't know.

37:19.175 --> 37:21.795
Hi, uh, can I have a, a beer?

37:23.342 --> 37:24.540
What kind?

37:25.092 --> 37:27.462
Uh, beer. A beer.

37:29.842 --> 37:34.381
And, uh, a pack of those cigarettes.

37:38.342 --> 37:43.083
Have you, uh, seen a guy in, uh,
around here with a red Camaro?

37:43.175 --> 37:45.878
We ain't got no red Camaros around here.

39:33.217 --> 39:34.461
Mind if I join?

39:34.550 --> 39:36.174
J and B and water.

39:36.967 --> 39:39.456
I figure, enjoy yourself.
Never know when you might, uh,

39:39.550 --> 39:41.956
step off a curb or get smacked
by a bus, correct?

39:42.050 --> 39:46.755
Or, shot jumping off a cliff.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.463
Do I know you?

39:49.550 --> 39:51.209
JC. Reynolds.

39:51.300 --> 39:52.794
I wrote your story.

39:52.883 --> 39:56.380
Oh, hey. Hi. Good.

39:56.467 --> 40:03.045
So my theory is you probably got
plugged by some border crossers.

40:03.133 --> 40:04.710
Probably saw something you
shouldn't have.

40:04.800 --> 40:08.795
I think it's more, it feels more like
I know something that I shouldn't.

40:08.883 --> 40:10.507
Well, feed me, man.

40:10.800 --> 40:12.673
You want to hear my story?

40:12.883 --> 40:16.748
This right here is foolproof.
This is the president.

40:16.842 --> 40:20.042
This is a triangulation of crossfire.

40:20.133 --> 40:23.216
This is the president and it, it can't fail.

40:23.300 --> 40:24.628
This...

40:24.717 --> 40:25.961
okay...this...

40:26.050 --> 40:28.622
the president's gonna get killed and...

40:28.717 --> 40:30.459
sometime soon here.

40:30.550 --> 40:33.300
I don't know where or when, but soon.

40:33.383 --> 40:36.299
You know,
you might have my ear, if, one,

40:36.383 --> 40:38.707
the president was coming anywhere
near this place and, two...

40:38.800 --> 40:40.045
you didn't get dropped on your
fuckin' head.

40:40.133 --> 40:41.841
On my tab, barkeep.

40:44.467 --> 40:45.380
Hey, man. You dropped somethin'.

40:45.467 --> 40:47.174
Thanks.

41:14.425 --> 41:16.547
Already wandering streets, huh?

41:17.425 --> 41:18.883
Hi.

41:19.425 --> 41:21.831
Yeah, I wanted to get some fresh air.

41:21.925 --> 41:23.964
Yeah, I know what you mean.

41:24.508 --> 41:25.255
Here.

41:25.508 --> 41:27.216
Thank you.

41:29.592 --> 41:32.295
So did you guys figure out
where you're from yet?

41:33.008 --> 41:35.379
Yeah, we're from Chicago.

41:35.675 --> 41:39.421
I don't look like I'm from
Chicago though.

41:40.050 --> 41:42.006
Farther away.

41:47.342 --> 41:50.175
You know, I used to talk to you
when you were unconscious.

41:50.258 --> 41:52.629
You did? What'd you say?

41:54.175 --> 41:55.455
What'd you say?

41:55.842 --> 41:58.129
Whatever it was, it worked, didn't it?

42:02.842 --> 42:04.004
I should go.

42:04.092 --> 42:06.463
Wait, um-.

42:10.675 --> 42:14.883
I just want to tell...
that you are really, really beautiful.

42:15.758 --> 42:20.298
And, uh thank you.

42:25.258 --> 42:27.049
I'll see you around.

42:36.092 --> 42:38.214
You shouldn't have been
wandering on your own.

42:39.008 --> 42:41.332
This, these still don't smell.

42:41.425 --> 42:42.421
Are you listening to me?

42:42.508 --> 42:45.543
Yeah, I, I went into a bar and
I had a cigarette.

42:46.675 --> 42:48.418
And then, look.

42:48.508 --> 42:50.749
That, the nervousness it's gone.

42:50.842 --> 42:52.252
You went to a bar, Frank?
Don't you want to get better?

42:53.300 --> 42:55.457
These aren't the clothes of a smoker?
Am I a smoker?

42:55.550 --> 42:58.715
No. No. Not anymore.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.128
What does that mean?

43:00.217 --> 43:01.876
What, why, why do I have cravings?

43:01.967 --> 43:03.508
I want an answer.

43:03.717 --> 43:05.957
The doctor said some things
would be out of line for awhile.

43:06.050 --> 43:08.207
Obviously, this is one of them.
Did you take your pills?

43:08.300 --> 43:10.173
Forget the pills.

43:11.133 --> 43:12.461
You know, Frank, I'm trying here.

43:12.550 --> 43:16.497
It's not easy going from your fianc?
to a perfect stranger in five days.

43:18.133 --> 43:24.498
I'm sorry. I, its' just-.

43:31.550 --> 43:32.795
Where'd you go?

43:32.883 --> 43:34.507
I'm getting undressed.

43:35.967 --> 43:39.001
You can't get undressed in front of me?

43:43.467 --> 43:45.174
I can.

45:28.508 --> 45:30.998
Hey. Have you seen that guy
in the red Camaro?

45:31.092 --> 45:32.254
I told you, man.

45:32.342 --> 45:33.835
Yeah, right, right.

45:33.925 --> 45:35.881
There is no guy with a red Camaro.

45:36.092 --> 45:41.165
Waiting game, huh?
Well, I got all the time in the world.

45:41.258 --> 45:43.131
Red Camaro Man.

45:43.842 --> 45:48.465
Hey, what goes good with medication?

45:53.425 --> 45:54.800
Tequila.

46:00.592 --> 46:01.872
Lime.

46:02.092 --> 46:04.960
Pain. Lime.

46:11.425 --> 46:15.290
It, it feels like maybe
I know something that I shouldn't.

46:18.592 --> 46:24.293
Once Rhombus is activated,
we anticipate an expeditious solution.

46:28.342 --> 46:33.628
We need a clean, confirmed kill.
It's your ballgame from there.

46:34.925 --> 46:38.706
There are people out there
who need to be stopped.

46:42.008 --> 46:44.296
Your discretion, of course.
We trust you.

46:44.383 --> 46:47.003
Why, why was I shot?

46:49.800 --> 46:52.633
There's some,
what if they know that I'm not dead?

46:52.717 --> 46:54.673
What if they come back?

47:13.717 --> 47:17.960
Here. You promised you
wouldn't just take off.

47:18.050 --> 47:19.757
I'm sorry.

47:20.883 --> 47:26.122
I just wanna make it go away.

47:26.217 --> 47:28.255
Where did you go, Frank?

47:28.342 --> 47:33.130
Just, just tell me that
what I'm believing is real.

47:34.592 --> 47:35.967
Please?

47:39.258 --> 47:40.882
Please?

47:44.675 --> 47:47.129
We'll get through this together, all right?

48:14.008 --> 48:15.206
Hey, Helsa.

48:16.508 --> 48:20.005
You see anyone interesting pass
through here the last couple of days?

48:20.092 --> 48:21.502
Interesting?

48:21.592 --> 48:23.548
Jack, it's a truck stop.

48:52.675 --> 48:54.631
I don't' think that color suits you.

48:54.925 --> 48:56.798
Nurse Liz.

48:56.925 --> 49:00.339
No, I, I'm, I was getting some-.

49:00.425 --> 49:01.670
Aspirin?

49:01.758 --> 49:03.335
Aspirin.

49:03.425 --> 49:08.379
I had a pretty vicious hanger.
But...but I feel better now.

49:08.592 --> 49:10.797
I'm surprised you're still here.

49:11.008 --> 49:14.208
If it was me, I'd have been gone
the moment they opened the door.

49:15.175 --> 49:16.752
Kind of trapped.

49:16.842 --> 49:18.798
Yeah, me, too.

49:19.008 --> 49:20.881
Excuse me.

49:53.342 --> 49:55.132
Oh, your cash is here. Grand Theater.

49:55.217 --> 49:57.125
Fifteen minutes.
Back row, first three seats.

49:57.217 --> 49:58.710
And don't be late.

49:58.800 --> 50:00.210
Housekeeping.

50:00.300 --> 50:02.091
Oh. I can come back.

51:01.883 --> 51:03.342
Red Devil?

51:04.300 --> 51:05.710
Wha'?

51:05.800 --> 51:07.424
Would you like a Red Devil?

51:09.050 --> 51:10.425
No, thanks.

51:16.217 --> 51:18.007
Wh-Where's Nico?

51:18.883 --> 51:20.674
I don't know.

51:42.967 --> 51:44.247
You know what?

51:44.883 --> 51:46.626
I'm just gonna go take a piss, all right?

51:46.717 --> 51:50.628
I mean, I don't, m-maybe you,
you, you got, you,

51:50.717 --> 51:52.045
maybe you're mad at me or you got,

51:52.133 --> 51:53.296
have something to say to me.

51:53.383 --> 51:54.711
But this is, this is ridiculous.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.498
I'll hold onto this until Nico gets back.
Whatever.

52:05.467 --> 52:06.332
Frank, you in here?

52:06.425 --> 52:07.504
Housekeeping.

52:07.592 --> 52:09.299
Oh, thanks.

52:26.758 --> 52:27.589
How do you know me?

52:27.675 --> 52:29.003
What?

52:29.092 --> 52:30.420
How do you know me, man?

52:30.508 --> 52:31.836
I know you like you know me.

52:31.925 --> 52:33.253
What do you mean how do I know you?

52:33.342 --> 52:34.337
How do you know me, man?

52:34.425 --> 52:35.504
Oh, don't fucking touch me, man.

52:35.592 --> 52:36.671
Well, how do you know me?

52:36.758 --> 52:39.046
Get the fuck outta here.

52:40.008 --> 52:41.585
Come here.

52:41.675 --> 52:43.334
You fuckin' know me now, huh?

52:43.425 --> 52:44.919
Fuckin' know me now.

52:45.008 --> 52:47.463
Fuckin' know me now, huh?

53:01.092 --> 53:02.171
Jack, I'm gonna need about an...

53:02.258 --> 53:04.167
hour so we can run a couple of tests.

53:04.258 --> 53:06.333
Yeah, all right.
I'll go grab me a cup of coffee.

53:06.425 --> 53:10.882
Okay. Don't have a lot of friends
in Black Point, do you, Frank?

53:14.675 --> 53:16.548
This is completely fucked up.

53:17.008 --> 53:18.668
Where'd you get that mouth of yours?

53:18.758 --> 53:20.418
I want to know who did this to Frank.

53:20.508 --> 53:22.630
Well, I'm afraid I can't answer
that one, ma'am.

53:23.675 --> 53:25.548
Well, what can you answer, Sheriff?

53:25.842 --> 53:29.504
Well, I can tell you that, uh,
someone's not too fond of your boyfriend.

53:29.592 --> 53:32.709
Well, yeah, and aren't you supposed
to be figuring out who that is?

53:32.925 --> 53:36.623
Well, sometimes domestic violence
is kinda tricky.

53:37.425 --> 53:38.919
Domestic violence?

53:40.133 --> 53:42.883
You know eighty percent, I,
this is kind of interesting, I think.

53:42.967 --> 53:47.210
Eighty percent of domestic attacks
are not necessarily carried out...

53:47.300 --> 53:50.714
by the spouse but someone, uh, hired...

53:50.800 --> 53:54.795
by the spouse or related to the spouse
in one way or another, you know?

53:54.883 --> 53:56.128
You're kidding me, right?

54:00.925 --> 54:03.675
Sheriff, twice now Frank has been hurt.

54:03.758 --> 54:05.418
Twice now he has almost been killed.

54:05.508 --> 54:06.588
And you guy do shit about it and

54:06.675 --> 54:09.081
now you're finding some twisted
way of blaming me for it?

54:09.175 --> 54:10.918
You are unbelievable, you know that?

54:11.008 --> 54:13.877
Sit down, sister. Sit down.

54:16.092 --> 54:18.842
Now, blame might be too strong a term...

54:19.175 --> 54:20.669
at this point in time.

54:20.758 --> 54:23.757
But there's something that just
keeps picking away at me.

54:23.842 --> 54:27.374
Why would you wait six days to
come and visit him?

54:27.508 --> 54:30.543
It's kind of unusual for a woman
in love, isn't it?

54:30.925 --> 54:37.005
Huh? No calls, no missing persons
report filed. Six whole days.

54:37.092 --> 54:39.332
Now, what were you doing
during all that time?

54:39.425 --> 54:41.630
Staring at your luggage?

54:44.425 --> 54:47.543
Sheriff, what do you know
about Frank, huh?

54:48.508 --> 54:52.041
You know his height
and his name and his weight.

54:52.758 --> 54:56.456
You think this is the first time
we've fought and he's taken off?

54:56.758 --> 54:59.923
Why don't you get to know a person
before you start making accusations.

55:00.008 --> 55:03.837
Honey, I don't have the time or
the inclination to get to know you.

55:03.925 --> 55:06.331
But I'll tell you one thing,
I've been doing this...

55:06.425 --> 55:11.842
job long enough to know that the truth
usually arrives in a dead simple package.

55:11.925 --> 55:14.415
And the more complicated
someone tries to make it,

55:14.508 --> 55:17.294
the less likely I am to believe it.

55:22.508 --> 55:23.587
You also like tequila.

55:23.675 --> 55:27.172
Tequila.
This is more, this is a live drink here.

55:27.258 --> 55:27.923
I don't want any.

55:28.008 --> 55:30.628
Yeah, come on, one more.

55:31.467 --> 55:33.375
Aren't we celebrating?

55:33.467 --> 55:35.293
I'll turn you into the local authorities.

55:35.383 --> 55:36.758
Ready?

55:42.050 --> 55:44.255
Hmm. Nice.

55:45.050 --> 55:47.006
Now.

55:52.050 --> 55:53.378
It's nice to see you smiling.

55:53.467 --> 55:54.842
Thank you.

56:00.383 --> 56:01.925
What?

56:02.050 --> 56:05.748
Nothing.
You just, you, uh, you surprise me.

56:06.050 --> 56:10.175
This, uh, part of you. It surprises me.

56:10.550 --> 56:11.878
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

56:11.967 --> 56:14.919
A good thing. A good thing, obviously.

56:19.550 --> 56:21.458
We're not so different now, you and I.

56:21.550 --> 56:22.712
What, we never were?

56:22.800 --> 56:25.918
No trust me, we were. Definitely.

57:03.300 --> 57:07.211
Yeah. Kolb here. Yeah.

57:10.425 --> 57:11.883
What, another one?

57:12.008 --> 57:14.166
The president's motorcade
continued its swing

57:14.258 --> 57:16.713
through the Southwest today,
traveling-

58:14.925 --> 58:16.253
Liz.

58:16.342 --> 58:17.835
Yes, Doctor.

58:17.925 --> 58:20.675
Someone thinks we're running
a speakeasy around here.

58:20.758 --> 58:22.039
What are you talking about?

58:25.258 --> 58:26.172
Those aren't mine.

58:26.258 --> 58:29.376
I didn't sat you, Liz. Someone.

58:31.508 --> 58:34.626
Fuck you, you creep. God.

58:45.842 --> 58:48.592
Frank.
What the hell happened in that theater?

58:48.675 --> 58:51.165
Guy sat down next to me and,
and he said he knew me.

58:51.258 --> 58:53.925
I told you that's all,
that's all that happened, and then-.

58:54.008 --> 58:55.087
Did you recognize him?

58:55.175 --> 58:56.834
What do you think?
Will you look for my smokes, please?

58:56.925 --> 58:58.335
I looked for 'em. I can't find them.

58:58.425 --> 59:00.831
Frank. What did this guy look like?

59:00.925 --> 59:03.758
He looked like a pi-, like a punk.

59:03.842 --> 59:06.545
Punk. And he just sits down next
to you and beats the crap out of you?

59:06.633 --> 59:08.376
No, he talked to me first and
then he beat the crap out of me.

59:08.467 --> 59:09.462
You talked?

59:09.550 --> 59:10.546
Yeah, I talked.

59:10.633 --> 59:15.588
He was all gibberish, like, compadre
and code-like and then, and then-.

59:31.217 --> 59:33.623
This isn't the guy that jumped
you in the theater, is it?

59:33.717 --> 59:35.127
Oh, gosh, no.

59:35.217 --> 59:38.500
Now, there's gotta be some reason
these guys want you out of the way.

59:39.300 --> 59:41.375
Frank, help me out here.

59:42.675 --> 59:45.627
You gotta start putting the pieces
together in this deal.

59:46.008 --> 59:47.087
What about the president?

59:47.175 --> 59:48.254
What about those pieces?

59:48.342 --> 59:50.049
Isn't that a pretty big piece, Sheriff?

59:50.258 --> 59:51.503
Frank, it doesn't make any sense.

59:51.592 --> 59:53.832
This isn't New York City or
Washington, D.C.

59:53.925 --> 59:55.004
Look where we are here.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.965
What's the president got to do with it?

01:02:52.842 --> 01:02:55.841
The crash occurred just outside
of Black Point, New Mexico.

01:02:55.925 --> 01:02:58.331
At this point they're uncertain
if there's a driver inside.

01:02:58.425 --> 01:03:01.424
But what is certain is no one is
getting past this highway.

01:03:01.508 --> 01:03:03.998
Obviously,
this is crossing the entire roadway.

01:03:04.092 --> 01:03:06.416
That means they're going to have
to divert traffic.

01:03:06.508 --> 01:03:10.171
They also have to find someplace
to put the presidential motorcade.

01:03:10.258 --> 01:03:12.712
Nothing is getting through
here right now.

01:03:33.008 --> 01:03:36.007
Come on, dance with me.

01:04:18.967 --> 01:04:20.709
Sheriff. Darius Thorestensen.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.585
PR director for the president's
reelection campaign.

01:04:24.383 --> 01:04:27.050
I, uh need to speak to you regarding
an urgent matter with the...

01:04:27.133 --> 01:04:29.836
president of the United States.

01:04:30.383 --> 01:04:31.711
You're kidding, right?

01:04:33.175 --> 01:04:35.380
The president of the United States.

01:04:58.175 --> 01:04:59.338
You look nice.

01:04:59.425 --> 01:05:01.049
Thank you.

01:05:03.758 --> 01:05:06.544
So, have you set a date yet?

01:05:06.758 --> 01:05:08.300
For what?

01:05:09.092 --> 01:05:10.550
For your wedding.

01:05:10.925 --> 01:05:13.249
Oh. No, we've...

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:15.961
we've, we've...

01:05:16.175 --> 01:05:18.250
we haven't, uh...

01:05:18.342 --> 01:05:20.796
been doing other things.

01:05:24.008 --> 01:05:26.379
Maybe your priorities have shifted.

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:29.087
You're lucky, you know.

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.711
Some people will do anything
to start over again.

01:05:33.008 --> 01:05:34.799
Are you like that?

01:05:36.008 --> 01:05:37.965
Can I ask you something?

01:05:39.425 --> 01:05:40.623
Sure.

01:05:45.425 --> 01:05:49.716
Have you ever done anything really bad?

01:05:51.092 --> 01:05:53.960
How's my local member
of the undead holding up?

01:05:54.508 --> 01:05:57.175
Hey, Liz, wait. What are you doing?

01:05:57.258 --> 01:05:59.297
What's new in that noggin of yours?

01:05:59.592 --> 01:06:00.920
You still chasing the lone gunman?

01:06:01.008 --> 01:06:04.007
Man, you are, got terrible timing.

01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:05.254
Where are you?

01:06:05.342 --> 01:06:06.586
Can I get my bill, please?

01:06:06.675 --> 01:06:09.709
Come on, Frank. You can trust me.

01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:15.381
Now, you take a layman's advice.

01:06:15.758 --> 01:06:17.169
Watch your back.

01:06:17.258 --> 01:06:18.633
Listen.

01:06:20.342 --> 01:06:21.835
Do you have something to say?

01:06:21.925 --> 01:06:23.964
Let me just say it straight, okay?

01:06:33.592 --> 01:06:35.382
Liz.

01:06:38.175 --> 01:06:39.550
What happened?

01:06:40.675 --> 01:06:42.334
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

01:06:42.425 --> 01:06:43.456
Why?

01:06:44.175 --> 01:06:46.083
If you want, you can come with me.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:48.131
Start over.

01:06:49.675 --> 01:06:53.622
Hmm, what, m-, why?
What's happening?

01:06:53.758 --> 01:06:56.627
What would you do if everything
was different?

01:06:57.675 --> 01:07:00.295
Everything is different.

01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:12.958
Do you remember at the hospital
you asked me if anyone takes care of me?

01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:15.001
- Yeah.
- Do you remember?

01:07:15.092 --> 01:07:18.007
Um, well, tomorrow,

01:07:18.092 --> 01:07:23.295
I will be here waiting for you
at noon if you want to come.

01:07:41.175 --> 01:07:42.882
My hat fell off.

01:08:49.175 --> 01:08:50.585
Get the hell outta here.

01:08:50.675 --> 01:08:53.046
Can't. You're my ride.

01:08:54.925 --> 01:08:56.964
Fine. We'll learn, all right?

01:08:59.091 --> 01:09:01.082
Who's that, guy in the beard, huh?

01:09:02.341 --> 01:09:03.504
Name's Novaro.

01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:06.258
Runs a smuggling syndicate
this side of the border.

01:09:06.341 --> 01:09:08.332
Smuggling humans.

01:09:08.425 --> 01:09:10.500
Novaro greases Dep's palm.

01:09:10.591 --> 01:09:13.875
Shirl moves 'em further up
country away from border patrol.

01:09:14.675 --> 01:09:18.006
This little operation's practically
funding his bid for sheriff.

01:09:22.383 --> 01:09:25.299
Could this possibly have to do
with the president?

01:09:25.383 --> 01:09:28.548
Oh, nothin', man. I told you.
Nothin' at all.

01:09:28.633 --> 01:09:31.716
It can't just all be in my imagination.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.087
It's border town strangeness.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.836
These are the guys that probably
came across your path.

01:11:46.383 --> 01:11:53.957
Everything, um,
that I thought was true is a lie.

01:11:59.092 --> 01:12:03.715
Everything they said was true.

01:12:04.342 --> 01:12:06.878
I'm sorry.

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:11.046
I don't want to talk about it.

01:13:11.508 --> 01:13:15.799
Can you hear me?

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.957
Yeah, it's Sterling. Theater at eleven.

01:13:49.050 --> 01:13:51.337
Yeah, sure.

01:13:53.050 --> 01:13:54.046
Who was that?

01:13:54.133 --> 01:13:57.168
It's the that guy from the theater.

01:13:57.717 --> 01:13:58.712
Sterling.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:02.131
He said, he, he said he wants to meet.

01:14:02.217 --> 01:14:04.255
You don't have to do this.

01:14:07.550 --> 01:14:09.008
Where have you been?

01:14:09.133 --> 01:14:10.757
Looking for you.

01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:13.207
That guy Sterling from the theater
he called. He wants a meeting.

01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:15.457
Yeah, have you got any idea
who's coming to town today?

01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:16.215
Who?

01:14:16.300 --> 01:14:19.050
I'll give you a hint.
He lives in a big white house.

01:14:19.133 --> 01:14:22.666
Now, how the hell you know this shit,
Frank, is beyond me.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:32.081
Who's there?

01:14:56.467 --> 01:14:57.546
Now, look, Frank.

01:14:57.633 --> 01:15:00.549
I don't know who you are or where you
come from or what your story is,

01:15:00.633 --> 01:15:03.087
but for some reason or another
I believe you.

01:15:03.967 --> 01:15:05.875
But if there's any way in hell
that you're settin'...

01:15:05.967 --> 01:15:08.919
me up or fixin' to put a knife in my back,

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:10.129
you better level with me right now,

01:15:10.217 --> 01:15:12.623
'cause I'm hanging my ass out
on a limb here for you.

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:16.332
All I can tell you is that,
that what I know is the truth.

01:15:17.467 --> 01:15:18.925
I promise.

01:15:20.717 --> 01:15:21.298
All right.

01:15:21.383 --> 01:15:24.086
I'll give you five minutes and
then I'm coming in after you.

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:01.671
Do you even know the president's name?

01:16:31.967 --> 01:16:33.674
Understand who we are?

01:16:57.425 --> 01:16:58.006
Where did he go?

01:16:58.092 --> 01:17:00.297
Well, this guy went through the back.

01:17:27.592 --> 01:17:28.920
Hey, it's me, Nico.

01:17:29.008 --> 01:17:30.253
I got your message.

01:17:30.342 --> 01:17:32.878
Sterling's been looking for you.
We're on.

01:17:35.842 --> 01:17:37.086
Yeah, it's Sterling.

01:17:37.175 --> 01:17:38.882
The theater at eleven.

01:17:39.342 --> 01:17:41.712
You're, you threatened the president.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.381
The plan is-.

01:17:56.217 --> 01:17:58.125
Hey, Shirl, you seen Frank anywhere?

01:17:58.217 --> 01:18:00.125
No, I haven't seen Frank.

01:18:00.217 --> 01:18:04.792
I've been busy the last hour
reading about this junk about me.

01:18:04.883 --> 01:18:06.543
And it's your doing.

01:18:06.633 --> 01:18:07.961
What the hell are you talking about?

01:18:08.050 --> 01:18:10.207
It's nothing but a piece of trash.

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:13.216
That's exactly what it is. It's junk.

01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:16.216
You have assassinated my character.

01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:17.463
And, God damn it,

01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:20.632
I want you to know if you want
a good fight I'll give you one.

01:18:20.717 --> 01:18:22.874
All seventy-two fuckin' years of me.

01:18:22.967 --> 01:18:25.586
And I'll take you down if you
don't watch me.

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.626
And like you say Jack.

01:18:27.717 --> 01:18:30.881
Why fuck a stranger
when you can fuck a friend?

01:18:30.967 --> 01:18:32.875
I'm outta here, gone.

01:18:32.967 --> 01:18:34.793
Oh, by the way.

01:18:34.883 --> 01:18:37.373
Your flag is flying high.

01:18:37.467 --> 01:18:42.042
I paid a man out of my own
pocket to fix it.

01:18:42.133 --> 01:18:44.090
Good luck to you, Jack.

01:18:44.383 --> 01:18:46.091
Sorry bastard.

01:23:52.925 --> 01:23:54.253
You're fine with this?

01:23:54.342 --> 01:23:55.717
Sure.

01:23:56.592 --> 01:23:57.623
How many?

01:23:57.925 --> 01:23:59.170
Three.

01:23:59.258 --> 01:24:00.717
You and two others.

01:24:08.592 --> 01:24:09.790
Payment?

01:24:10.092 --> 01:24:11.633
Ten each.

01:24:12.592 --> 01:24:14.500
Half up, half on completion.

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:17.626
We need a clean, confirmed kill.

01:24:18.925 --> 01:24:20.419
Go word is Rhombus.

01:24:20.508 --> 01:24:21.753
Standard encryption.

01:24:21.842 --> 01:24:23.300
Voice activated.

01:24:24.342 --> 01:24:25.421
Yours only.

01:24:25.508 --> 01:24:27.465
Rhombus.

01:24:51.425 --> 01:24:53.216
Tough day at the office?

01:24:59.675 --> 01:25:02.081
Oh, look who stepped out
from behind the curtain.

01:25:02.175 --> 01:25:06.122
It was time. Trust me.

01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:08.667
Canceling a presidential assassination...

01:25:08.758 --> 01:25:11.757
is much harder than planning one, Ryan.

01:25:11.842 --> 01:25:12.755
Well, I'm sorry...

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:14.668
I didn't accommodate your
change of plans.

01:25:14.758 --> 01:25:16.964
You know full well the stakes.

01:25:17.342 --> 01:25:19.168
No matter which way things fall,
in the end...

01:25:19.258 --> 01:25:23.467
we deal with the reality of the situation.

01:25:24.758 --> 01:25:28.800
Well, here's the reality of the
situation staring you in the face.

01:25:30.008 --> 01:25:33.422
Of course,
we did need a link to the other...

01:25:33.508 --> 01:25:35.381
members of your team.

01:25:36.508 --> 01:25:38.547
You don't remember me?

01:25:42.175 --> 01:25:45.044
We'll get through this together,
all right?

01:25:46.842 --> 01:25:49.545
You used me as bait to find
the other shooters.

01:25:58.092 --> 01:26:00.581
Once Rhombus became...
active you became an asset.

01:26:00.675 --> 01:26:01.955
Rhombus.

01:26:03.342 --> 01:26:05.380
Disposable asset.

01:26:07.508 --> 01:26:09.299
You're a professional.

01:26:10.092 --> 01:26:11.336
We're all professionals.

01:26:11.425 --> 01:26:14.045
You, me, Chloe.

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:29.208
Hey. You got lucky. Walk away.

01:26:32.175 --> 01:26:34.499
Hence protocol.

01:26:34.592 --> 01:26:36.334
Once Rhombus is active...

01:26:36.425 --> 01:26:39.922
all termination commands
are inoperative.

01:26:40.008 --> 01:26:43.422
As someone such as yourself
might be turned...

01:26:43.508 --> 01:26:45.334
there'd be no termination commands.

01:26:45.425 --> 01:26:46.753
You will not stand down.

01:26:46.842 --> 01:26:49.213
I will not stand down.

01:27:18.342 --> 01:27:21.175
Wake up. You.

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:25.169
Frank. Frank, pick up.

01:28:17.342 --> 01:28:18.883
Put the gun down, Frank.

01:28:21.175 --> 01:28:22.455
How'd you do that?

01:28:22.758 --> 01:28:24.880
My name isn't Frank.

01:28:26.175 --> 01:28:27.882
You're breathing harder than
when we made love.

01:28:27.967 --> 01:28:29.508
Why is that?

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:32.088
I think maybe fear's stronger than love?

01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:34.507
This was never about us.

01:28:35.425 --> 01:28:37.749
- Well, I think it is about us.
- Put the gun down, Frank.

01:28:37.842 --> 01:28:40.047
I don't want to kill you.
Put your gun down.

01:28:40.925 --> 01:28:42.964
I have a job to do.

01:28:45.758 --> 01:28:47.715
Just put the gun down.

01:28:48.592 --> 01:28:53.049
I can't. Maybe Frank could, but-.

01:28:58.508 --> 01:29:00.666
- Please.
- Don't do this.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.922
Put the gun down!

01:29:16.133 --> 01:29:17.592
All right.

01:29:18.633 --> 01:29:20.341
Well, then shoot me.

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:28.258
No.

01:29:30.217 --> 01:29:31.545
Please?

01:29:31.633 --> 01:29:33.341
I don't want to.

01:29:36.967 --> 01:29:38.377
Don't.

01:29:45.925 --> 01:29:47.300
Put the gun down. Put the weapon down.

01:29:47.383 --> 01:29:49.541
Sheriff, I'm a federal agent
on a national security assignment.

01:29:49.633 --> 01:29:51.459
Drop, I don't give a shit who you are.

01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:53.376
Put the gun down now.
You're under arrest.

01:29:53.467 --> 01:29:54.877
This man is going to kill the president...

01:29:55.175 --> 01:29:57.167
- and there's another shooter.
- Pretty convincing, isn't she, Sheriff?

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.669
Honey, I'm not gonna ask you again.

01:29:58.758 --> 01:30:01.425
- Put the gun down!
- You don't know what you're fuckin'-.

01:30:14.425 --> 01:30:16.216
Oh, God.

01:30:32.675 --> 01:30:34.880
Well, you really got me going Frank.

01:30:37.592 --> 01:30:39.879
Guess I had it all turned around, huh?

01:32:45.717 --> 01:32:48.585
What would you do if everything
was different?

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.714
Wait!

01:32:59.758 --> 01:33:02.544
And I can't see the president.

01:33:04.508 --> 01:33:06.465
Oh, my God!

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:28.422
Son of a bitch.
