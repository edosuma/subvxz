- [Child #2]
Bye, you big baby!

11:30.816 --> 11:34.183
Oh, hey.
Um, can you believe
those little bastards?

11:34.278 --> 11:36.815
I’d like to...
ring their scrawny necks.

11:36.905 --> 11:39.362
- Lawrence, just take a deep breath.
- Save it.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.191
I don’t need another
lecture on how much
I could learn from Debbie.

11:42.286 --> 11:45.278
- Lawrence—
- No. She’s not even
here today, Bianca.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.328
I am. That ought
to count for something.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.953
Excuse me. F.B.I.
I think we need to have a chat.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.331
- What? Why?
- Because we think
you might be a murderer.

11:53.422 --> 11:54.628
[ Booth ]
Right.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.377
By the way,
you have a tiny sword in your hair.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.254
Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah.
Did I get it?

12:00.345 --> 12:03.178
- [Together] No.
- It’s really stuck
in there though.

12:03.307 --> 12:05.218
It’s right there.
No.
[ Mutters ]

12:05.309 --> 12:07.470
No.
You can’t find it?
It’s right there.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.558
[ Lawrence]
You think I killed Debbie?

12:12.649 --> 12:14.389
[ Brennan ]
Well, you’ve already
admitted your desire...

12:14.484 --> 12:18.568
to strangle children,
so you’re a reasonable suspect.

12:18.655 --> 12:19.986
I was stressed.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.109
All I wanna do
is work on new concepts,

12:22.200 --> 12:23.906
but they always
went to Debbie for that.

12:23.994 --> 12:27.612
Perhaps now that she’s dead,
you’ll be able to do what you want.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.118
Uh, I didn’t like
the way that sounded.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.911
I did.
Thanks, Booth.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.492
Mm-hmm.
O-Okay, look.

12:33.587 --> 12:35.168
Fine. I was jealous of Debbie,

12:35.255 --> 12:37.837
but I am not the guy
you should be questioning.

12:37.925 --> 12:41.292
She’d been calling in “sick”
a lot lately.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.342
Then I started to notice
other little things,

12:43.430 --> 12:45.091
like, uh, her whispering
into the phone...

12:45.182 --> 12:46.797
when she thought
nobody was looking.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.767
Or texting during meetings.
You think she was seeing someone?

12:49.853 --> 12:51.434
And it was affecting her work.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.898
You know, not that—
Not that Bianca cared.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.394
Hmm. Who do you think
she was seeing?

12:56.485 --> 12:58.225
[ Stammers ]
Noidea.

12:58.320 --> 13:01.027
I mean, like I said,
she was very secretive.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.606
A-And now she’s gone,
so that’s-that’s fishy, right?

13:04.701 --> 13:07.078
Where were you
the night she disappeared?

13:08.413 --> 13:11.120
I-I-I was home, watching TV.
The Skins were the night game.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.205
Right. It was
a good game.
Yeah, right?

13:13.293 --> 13:15.249
Anyone with you?

13:15.337 --> 13:17.123
No. Nobody.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.580
My, uh, wife and kids were
in Florida with their in-laws.

13:19.675 --> 13:22.838
But look, I would never
hurt Debbie, I swear.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.509
Sure. Okay.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.429
You just stay close.
You understand, Larry?

13:27.516 --> 13:29.723
[ Clears Throat]
Uh, Booth, I’m not sure that I can—

13:29.851 --> 13:31.466
Oh, well, I’ll just—
get up from this.

13:31.603 --> 13:34.310
[Grunts] I gotcha.
It’s the chairs.
Okay.

13:34.398 --> 13:35.888
Stay close.
I’m up.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.944
There’s a small piece of metal
embedded in this vertebra.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.815
Dr. Saroyan would like you to ID. it
and swab for particulates.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.522
Okay. If you put it on my desk,
I should be done here...

13:46.243 --> 13:47.528
shortly.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.404
Whoa!

13:48.537 --> 13:50.823
The prince’s leg.
Yep.

13:50.914 --> 13:55.078
Well, it’s only fitting that
the king of the lab should
make the prince whole again.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.043
May I have it?
No. Not yet.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.829
The prince’s leg is burned.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.664
Burned?

14:02.759 --> 14:05.171
First drawn and quartered,
and then burned?

14:05.262 --> 14:08.095
What kind of an animal
could do such a thing?

14:10.642 --> 14:13.224
Crusting around the edges
indicates it’s a chemical burn.

14:13.311 --> 14:17.350
Amount of oxidation says it happened
approximately two weeks ago.

14:17.441 --> 14:19.727
That coincides with the time
the prince was killed.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.111
And the victim.
Yes.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.447
They were murdered
at the same time.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.238
Something fused to the burn.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.247
Trace amounts of linear
low-density polyethylene.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.958
The plastic wrap.
Okay, yeah.
Very good, Ms. Wick.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.037
Now if you will excuse me,

14:41.131 --> 14:44.089
I’m going to find out
what burned through
the plastic...

14:44.176 --> 14:46.041
and singed
Prince Charmington,

14:46.136 --> 14:48.127
and that might help us
figure out how they died.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.803
You truly are the king of the lab.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.848
Milady.
Milord.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.178
[Sighs]

14:59.858 --> 15:01.348
What is all of this?

15:01.443 --> 15:04.560
Hey, uh, this is a—
a walking toy for Michael.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.368
Let me know how you like it.
Perhaps I’ll get one someday.

15:14.456 --> 15:15.912
This is gonna be
kinda cool, huh?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.957
- Us raising our kids
at the same time?
- Yes.

15:19.044 --> 15:21.080
And since my daughter will be younger,

15:21.171 --> 15:23.628
I can learn from your inevitable mistakes.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.092
Thank you, honey.

15:26.176 --> 15:31.011
Okay, so, do you think
that this part is A3?

15:31.098 --> 15:33.680
Or is this A3?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.852
Oh, I think this is.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.806
Why are the instructions
in Chinese?

15:41.900 --> 15:43.265
Oh, that’s just the diagrams.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.066
This side is English.

15:45.153 --> 15:50.113
“Insert to parts,
for assemble which toy
can have immediately.”

15:51.201 --> 15:52.566
Oh, my God. Okay.

15:52.661 --> 15:54.947
Um, you know what?
I need a break from this.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.653
Did you finish the bone scan?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.864
Yes. Yes. Let me—
Let me show you.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.415
So we’ve already established
that the victim...

16:04.506 --> 16:07.714
was facedown on the concrete
when she was struck.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.042
Causing the compound fractures...

16:10.137 --> 16:14.005
to the T7, scapula,
humerus and ulna.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.011
It’s a lot of blows.
Someone was really pissed.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.933
On the contrary.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.478
See how the damage
is all limited to one area?

16:22.566 --> 16:25.103
If this were rage,
why were the head and legs...

16:25.235 --> 16:28.523
left untouched?
Right. Yeah.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.114
This is too precise for rage.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.234
[ Exhales ]
Makes it even creepier.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.656
Extend the victim’s right arm
above her head...

16:36.746 --> 16:39.658
and the left arm at her side.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.374
- Just as I thought.
- The breaks line up exactly.

16:43.461 --> 16:47.204
The injuries were all caused
by one huge crushing blow.

16:47.299 --> 16:48.914
But what weapon is that big?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.126
I have no idea who could
even lift a weapon that large.

16:52.220 --> 16:54.802
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

17:02.939 --> 17:05.772
I just wanted to thank you again
for allowing me in the field.

17:06.776 --> 17:08.607
Right. Okay.
Bones couldn’t make it.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.108
I needed a squint,
so don’t read anything into it.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.856
Of course.
Right? Exactly.

17:14.951 --> 17:16.407
But, you know, after today,

17:16.494 --> 17:19.281
I will have been field-tested,
and Lance is getting a gun,

17:19.372 --> 17:21.704
which means that someday,
you and Dr. Brennan...

17:21.791 --> 17:23.827
and Lance and me
can be in the field together.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.793
It’ll be like
a murdery double date.
No, it won’t.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.370
I’m gonna be
really clear on this, okay?

17:28.465 --> 17:31.207
You are not to open up your mouth
unless it’s relevant to the case.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.132
Roger that.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.463
But I just have to mention
how disappointed I am...

17:37.557 --> 17:40.048
that you aren’t more supportive
of Lance getting a gun.

17:40.143 --> 17:41.758
I just thought
you were a better friend.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.263

Right.

17:48.777 --> 17:50.313
[Chuckles]

17:54.157 --> 17:58.571
According to Security,
Debbie’s access card was
last used in our prototype lab.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.402
It’s right up here.
You don’t have to direct
anything toward me.

18:00.497 --> 18:01.782
I’m not allowed
to speak.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.158
[ Clears Throat]
Oh.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.663
This is where we develop
the prototypes for new products.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.414
This is where
Prince Charmington...

18:08.505 --> 18:11.212
and Little Miss Twinkle Starlight
were born.

18:11.299 --> 18:15.759
And I’m gonna need each of you
to sign a nondisclosure form
before we enter.

18:15.845 --> 18:19.554
I can’t do that.
I’m with the FBI.
What we do is disclose.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.553
Well, then I can’t allow you to stay here.

18:22.644 --> 18:24.600
Well, we can always
shut the building down...

18:24.688 --> 18:27.145
while we wait for a warrant,
if that’s what you’d prefer.

18:27.232 --> 18:30.144
I’m sure the press
would love a story like that.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.688
Fine.

18:32.821 --> 18:35.233
That was relevant, wasn’t it?
I cop, you squint.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.323
Oh, then, permission
to squint, Agent Booth.
Squint away.

18:40.996 --> 18:42.782
Look at all the plastic wrap,
Agent Booth.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.373
Yeah?

18:46.126 --> 18:49.243
This could be the same type of plastic
the body was wrapped in.

I’ll have Hodgins |.D. it.

Uh, this door looks like
it’s been broken into.

18:53.466 --> 18:56.003
Is this door on any kind
of an alarm system?

18:56.094 --> 18:59.052
No. Security told us
that no one could break in this way.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.004
[ Booth ]
It looks like it weighs
about a half ton.

19:01.099 --> 19:02.885
If this door came down
on the victim,

19:02.976 --> 19:07.219
it would’ve caused
the fracturing that we saw
and collapsed her lungs.

- Agent Booth.
- Wow. Look at that.

I have something for you.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.002
The shard found
in the crushed vertebra,

21:00.093 --> 21:03.961
it’s an alloy—
73% aluminum and 27% steel.

21:04.055 --> 21:08.344
It is the same metal
as the strip on the bottom
of the loading dock door.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.676
[ Saroyan ]
So we have our murder weapon.

21:10.812 --> 21:13.269
Someone slammed the door
down on Debbie.
Yeah.

21:17.861 --> 21:19.772
This is what Booth saw.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.979
It shows us how someone
broke into the warehouse.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.528
It’s just torn metal.
Yes, but look what tore it.

21:27.537 --> 21:29.368
They had a zillion-dollar
security system,

21:29.456 --> 21:32.664
and someone popped the door
with a cheapo carjack.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.207
Now this is where the notch
on the lifting arm...

21:35.295 --> 21:37.911
is supposed
to accept the hard point
from a car’s suspension.

21:38.006 --> 21:43.217
Okay? But the door material
is much softer than the jack,
and so it tore.

21:43.303 --> 21:45.589
Then Debbie must
have been in the workshop
when the killer broke in.

21:45.680 --> 21:48.547
It’s someone who knew
the value of those prototypes.

21:48.641 --> 21:52.634
So maybe she was
just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

21:52.729 --> 21:54.185

21:54.272 --> 21:56.934
I heard you were helpful
at the murder scene, Ms. Wick.

21:57.025 --> 21:59.937
You did?
What did Agent Booth say?

22:00.028 --> 22:02.064
That you were helpful
at the murder scene.

22:02.155 --> 22:05.318
Wait. Are you doing
an autopsy on a doll?

22:05.408 --> 22:07.740
Yes, but hear me out.

22:07.827 --> 22:11.069
I strongly believe
that careful examination
of the prince’s remains...

22:11.164 --> 22:13.029
will provide vital evidence.

22:13.124 --> 22:17.242
You have one minute of my attention.
Use it wisely.

22:21.591 --> 22:24.549
Note where the femoral head
meets the acetabulum.

22:24.636 --> 22:28.629
Well, the doll would need
some sort of attachment
to hold the limbs in place.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.384
The prince was hand-assembled.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.808
A worker would thread a rubber band
through the torso.

22:33.895 --> 22:37.683
Oh. The band would serve
as a substitute for the iliofemoral,

22:37.774 --> 22:40.857
pubofemoral and ischiofemoral
ligament attachments.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.229
Exactly.

22:42.320 --> 22:44.436
The ligaments were severed
as the limbs were pulled apart.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.146
It was a struggle.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.607
The evil killer
grabbed Prince Charmington.

22:48.701 --> 22:51.408
Our victim said no!
A struggle ensued.

22:51.496 --> 22:55.830
Ending with the head
of the prince’s femur
being torn from the acetabulum.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.078
Why would anyone fight over a toy?

22:58.169 --> 23:00.160
Judging from the construction,

23:00.255 --> 23:02.917
this prince is from
the original Charmington run.

23:03.007 --> 23:05.089
1967.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.132
He’s worth over $10,000.

23:08.304 --> 23:10.295
That would certainly give us
motive for murder.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.301
[Angela ]
Sorry about the mess.
I’m almost finished.

23:16.396 --> 23:21.561
So the F.B.l. dropped off
Debbie’s home computer.

23:21.651 --> 23:23.232
I’m telling you, this girl was clean.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.810
Zero porn, zero gambling.

23:25.905 --> 23:27.861
There wasn’t even a dirty picture
from a congressman.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.610
[ Chuckles ]
Don’t sound so disappointed.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.033
[ Chuckles ]
I did find one thing though.

23:32.120 --> 23:34.611
So Debbie had
an online alert set up...

23:34.706 --> 23:38.824
for whenever vintage
or special-edition Dillio toys
came up at auction.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.295
But there’s only one auction site.

23:41.379 --> 23:43.620
Yeah. Because she wasn’t
interested in the buyers.

23:43.715 --> 23:45.171
I don’t understand.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.544
She was following the sellers.

23:47.635 --> 23:50.251
This one in particular.

23:50.346 --> 23:53.383
This one has
a Prince Charmington horse
and jousting knight.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.510
Look what she wrote to the seller.

23:57.979 --> 24:01.096
[ Saroyan ]
“The only original in existence
was at Dillio H.Q.

24:01.190 --> 24:02.475
You stole it.”

24:02.567 --> 24:04.353
And this one.

24:04.444 --> 24:08.528
“If you don’t return what you took—
and I mean everything—

24:08.615 --> 24:11.277
I’m gonna call the cops.”

24:11.367 --> 24:14.029
The guy doesn’t respond.
Then—

24:15.496 --> 24:17.157
“I’m warning you, Debbie,
stay out of it.”

24:17.248 --> 24:18.784
This guy knew who she was?

24:18.875 --> 24:22.538
I traced the LP. address.
It belongs to her brother.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.755
[ Booth ]
Look, it’s not that I don’t
want you to carry a gun, Sweets.

24:31.846 --> 24:34.804

It’s just that I’m just
concerned about your welfare.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.472
Yeah, ’cause you think
I’m incompetent.

24:36.559 --> 24:39.141
Guess what. I aced
my last practice round at the range.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.889
That’s a practice range.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.481
All right?
There’s a difference.

24:42.565 --> 24:44.351
But, you know,
when the real guns come out,

24:44.442 --> 24:46.307
there’s no time for thinking.

24:46.402 --> 24:49.269
It’s just reaction. You understand?

24:49.364 --> 24:51.275
That’s why they put people
through Hogan’s Alley.

24:51.366 --> 24:52.731

I’m not aware of that?

- You got a warrant?

25:07.465 --> 25:09.376
- Nope.
- Okay then. Good-bye.

25:09.467 --> 25:13.506
You have been stealing vintage toys
from Dillio and auctioning them online.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.427
Mail fraud’s a federal offense.

25:15.515 --> 25:18.131

to get that warrant?
If I were you, I’d cooperate.

Red Fred Sub Commander.

have a receipt for that, hmm?

Is that for Santa’s sleigh?

25:39.622 --> 25:41.328
I bet that jack
matches the marks...

25:41.416 --> 25:43.247

at Dillio Toys.

25:43.334 --> 25:44.619

25:49.924 --> 25:51.585
You sister must’ve been
pretty upset...

25:51.676 --> 25:53.541
when she caught you
stealing toys from Dillio.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.843
Yeah, but it’s not
the first time I got
into a little trouble.

25:55.972 --> 25:58.258
She was cool.
She threatened
to turn you in to the cops.

25:58.349 --> 26:00.556
All talk.
Debbie would never
do that to me!

26:00.643 --> 26:02.725
Really? Because if Bianca found out
that you were stealing stuff,

26:02.812 --> 26:04.473
your sister would have lost her job.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.271
Debbie’s identity
was tied to her toys
and herjob at Dillio.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.019
She would have been lost
without them.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.395
I’m her brother!

26:10.486 --> 26:13.102
- She owes her brother, right?
- She caught you stealing.

26:13.197 --> 26:16.405
You two get into an argument
and she tries to escape,
so what do you do?

26:16.492 --> 26:19.655
You hit the cargo door release.
Wham! Squashed your sister like a bug.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.032
Debbie was not there
when I broke into the factory!

26:22.123 --> 26:25.331
Really? Because I think she was,
and I think she caught you stealing this.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.013
Oh, my God.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.924
Was this with her when she died?

26:43.019 --> 26:46.261
- You recognize it?
- Sure.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.313
This was Debbie’s.
This was the last thing Mom gave her.

26:53.237 --> 26:55.353
And Debbie would never let it
get scraped up like this.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.109
- Who did it?
- That’s a valuable doll.

so I’m thinking it was you.

her whole childhood...

27:51.420 --> 27:53.206
to finally make something
of herself,

27:53.297 --> 27:56.255
and when she does,
she just gets murdered.

You shouldn’t get attached
to the victims.

trapped between the glue
and the nail,

from the struggle.

34:05.628 --> 34:08.836
Uh, you did goodish.
Goodish, how?

34:09.757 --> 34:11.668
Good enough to have my back.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.920
Thank you.

34:19.391 --> 34:22.849
I know why you wanted
to see me, Dr. Saroyan.
It’s touching.

34:22.937 --> 34:25.804
Touching? It is?

34:25.898 --> 34:28.184
You’re worried about Lance.
But he’ll be fine.

34:28.275 --> 34:29.981
They wanted to give him four stitches,

34:30.069 --> 34:31.559
but he toughed it out with two—

34:31.654 --> 34:33.315
because that’s just
the kind of man he is.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.896
Yes. I heard it was just a scratch.

34:35.991 --> 34:38.858
Scratches don’t require stitches.

34:38.953 --> 34:40.363
Right.

I actually called you in

- Prince Charmington!

He’s the guy that plays

He was signing dolls
at the mall last year.

35:09.024 --> 35:11.015
I had him sign three.
Oh.

35:13.821 --> 35:16.688
Didn’t Booth say that the victim
might’ve been in a secret relationship?

35:17.408 --> 35:19.615
I can’t believe it.

36:10.836 --> 36:12.667
I thought she was
breaking up with me.

36:12.755 --> 36:14.370
That’s why I hadn’t heard from her.

36:14.465 --> 36:17.081
So you’re the guy
she was dating.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.758
She used to say
she’d finally
found her prince,

36:19.845 --> 36:22.257
but I was the lucky one.

36:23.974 --> 36:26.966
I felt like the frog
the princess kissed.

36:28.771 --> 36:33.185
Wow, you really
take this whole, uh,
Charmington thing serious.

36:33.317 --> 36:36.309
We found your skin cells
under her nails.
You think that—

36:37.571 --> 36:39.357
I didn’t kill her.

36:39.490 --> 36:42.106
Then how do you explain—
Look, Debbie was very—

36:43.327 --> 36:45.943
She was very passionate, okay?

36:46.038 --> 36:48.199
Haven’t you ever been scratched
when you’ve been making love?

36:48.290 --> 36:50.451
Uh-huh. Yeah.

36:51.502 --> 36:53.618
So, you two met at work.

36:53.712 --> 36:56.704
Why all the secrecy
about the relationship here?

36:56.799 --> 36:59.506
Look, employee dating
was against company policy.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.208
Bianca, she’s got a lot of rules there.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.841
Right. And you would’ve
lost the whole, um,
Charmington gig here.

37:04.932 --> 37:07.093
I didn’t care so much about that.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.926
Yeah, but Debbie, she—
You know, she wanted
to leave on good terms.

37:10.020 --> 37:13.057
Dillio was her life.
Why would she wanna quit?

37:13.148 --> 37:15.560
Toys were her life.

37:15.651 --> 37:18.188
Not Dillio.

37:18.278 --> 37:22.271
I encouraged her to take
the toys she was developing
and go out on her own.

37:22.366 --> 37:25.108
Debbie was the brains there.
Why shouldn’t she be
the one to get rich?

37:25.244 --> 37:27.656
Did she quit?
I don’t know.

37:28.831 --> 37:30.992
When she stopped
returning my calls,
I figured,

37:31.083 --> 37:34.041
you know, she tried,
and it-it hadn’t worked out.

37:34.169 --> 37:36.876
And you thought
she blamed you for it.
Sure.

37:36.964 --> 37:41.298
You know, I’m not
really used to things
working out in my life.

37:41.385 --> 37:44.001

37:46.765 --> 37:49.097
The corrosive that burned
the doll’s leg...

37:49.184 --> 37:51.561
is lead sulfate from a car battery.

37:51.645 --> 37:53.727
That would’ve had to burn
through the plastic...

37:53.814 --> 37:55.475
while the remains
were being transported.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.306
Uh, car batteries are by the engine.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.858
There’s not enough room
for a body in that part of the car.

37:59.945 --> 38:04.188
That’s what I thought
till Dr. Brennan found these.

38:04.283 --> 38:06.114
The fibers are Berber wool.

38:06.201 --> 38:08.157
I assume this connects somehow.

38:08.245 --> 38:13.706
Right. The isotope analysis
shows that the fibers
were made in Modena, Italy.

38:13.792 --> 38:17.660
The chromium pigments in the dye
tell me that it was made for Maserati,

38:17.754 --> 38:21.121
and look where the battery
was placed in this model—

38:21.216 --> 38:22.672
In the trunk.

38:22.759 --> 38:26.092
They used the wool
as a liner for their car trunks.

38:26.180 --> 38:28.421
If the fibers were in the fractures,

38:28.515 --> 38:32.884
that means that the victim’s blood
has to be on the liner.

38:32.978 --> 38:37.722
I’ll have Booth check
to see if anyone at Dillio
has a car like that.

38:37.816 --> 38:39.772
Excuse me, Ms. Chiverton.

38:39.860 --> 38:41.851

what happened to Debbie?

as it was coming down.
