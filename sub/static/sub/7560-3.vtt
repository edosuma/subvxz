<i>[Eep] There were four seasons
in the Croodaceous Era:</i>

<i>Because during hot danger,</i>

I know it's not your favorite place, Ugga,

01:24.995 --> 01:26.663
but the only way to cool down
on a Sun-Day

01:26.746 --> 01:28.414
is going to the watering hole.

01:28.665 --> 01:30.792
Oh, gee, I don't know.

01:30.876 --> 01:36.172
I was thinking about staying
on the shore, sunbathing, stalling.

Huh. Thought us agreeing
would be the death of me.

01:42.762 --> 01:44.597
What do you wanna do first, Eep?

01:44.681 --> 01:47.684
I got a new game I wanna try
called "Rock-o Stone-o".

01:47.767 --> 01:50.603
Ready? Let's play.
Rock-o.

01:50.687 --> 01:52.480
Rock-o?

01:52.564 --> 01:55.191
Eep, you're supposed
to say "Stone-o".

01:55.274 --> 01:58.945
Oh, um, look, I'm gonna be blunt.

01:59.029 --> 02:00.989
Cool!
We're changing our names?

02:01.072 --> 02:02.281
Can I be Thunkster?

02:02.365 --> 02:05.785
I'm going to hang out

02:05.869 --> 02:07.620
You're my little brother, okay?

02:07.704 --> 02:10.582
But you're not ready to hang out
with us big kids.

02:10.664 --> 02:13.459
We do a lot of daring stuff.

02:13.543 --> 02:15.127
- I'm daring.
- Please.

02:15.211 --> 02:17.047
You've never even been in the deep end.

02:18.882 --> 02:21.593
[screams] What if there are
monsters in there?

02:21.676 --> 02:24.721
[sighs] There are no monsters
in the deep end.

02:24.804 --> 02:27.766
- You're just scared.
- Am not.

02:27.849 --> 02:30.309
Roar.
[shrieks]

02:30.393 --> 02:33.145
Why don't you go play
in the shallow end?

02:33.229 --> 02:35.607
No monsters over there.
Only Womp.

02:48.078 --> 02:50.080
[hisses]
No.

02:50.162 --> 02:52.582
You never know what's lurking
beneath the surface.

02:52.665 --> 02:55.710
Predators, sea sludge,
a strange world where fish rule

02:55.794 --> 02:58.588
and cavemen are caught and eaten.
Nobody knows!

02:58.671 --> 03:01.466
How have you avoided going in
the watering hole for this long?

03:01.549 --> 03:02.592
Practice.

03:02.675 --> 03:04.928
<i>Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.</i>

03:05.011 --> 03:08.807
- You can lead an Ugga to water...
- But you can't make her swim.

03:08.890 --> 03:10.892
Now you're finishing my sentences?

03:10.976 --> 03:14.144
No, you're starting my sentences!

Hey, Bulk, eat this gross stuff.

03:27.993 --> 03:30.745
[groans]
Only a weirdo would eat that.

03:30.829 --> 03:33.205
Nope, weirdo here,
and I am not interested.

03:33.289 --> 03:36.709
Who would be?
Nobody's that crazy.

03:36.793 --> 03:40.922
[gasps] I'll eat it.

03:41.006 --> 03:42.966
Aaahhh!

03:47.012 --> 03:48.262
Ta-da!

03:48.346 --> 03:51.307
Wait.
Might not stay down.

03:51.390 --> 03:52.725
No... Wait.

03:52.809 --> 03:54.226
[gasps] Wait.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.021
[gulps] We're good.

03:56.104 --> 03:58.731
- Ta-da!
- Ew! Thunk.

03:58.815 --> 04:01.943
I think I speak for everybody
when I say that was...

04:02.027 --> 04:03.444
- Awesome!
- You're the coolest!

04:03.528 --> 04:04.946
- All right!
- Totally.

04:05.030 --> 04:09.492
- See? I'm just as daring as you.
- We had no idea.

04:09.575 --> 04:12.328
All this time, we thought
she was the cool Crood.

04:12.411 --> 04:14.539
You know, her.

04:14.622 --> 04:18.416
- Uh... what's her name?
- Eep. My name is...

04:18.500 --> 04:19.377
[groans]

04:19.459 --> 04:24.007
Well, if you wanna hang out with my
friends, I challenge you to a dare-off.

04:24.090 --> 04:27.673
- Ooh, I love a good dare-off!
- Yeah, nothin' better

04:27.708 --> 04:30.638
than watchin' people do things
you'd never do. [chuckles]

04:30.722 --> 04:32.849
If I do it, you have to do it.

04:32.932 --> 04:36.435
And if you chickuna out,
back to the shallow end.

04:36.519 --> 04:38.604
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.650
First dare: drink out of a gusher.

04:42.734 --> 04:44.485

05:01.252 --> 05:03.838

05:03.922 --> 05:08.927
We are fine... right... here.

05:09.010 --> 05:11.303
See? Totally fine.

05:11.387 --> 05:14.182

Listen to your mother.

05:14.265 --> 05:16.684
<i>Can I do something else
for this dare?</i>

05:16.768 --> 05:18.728
Anything?
It can be life-threatening.

05:18.811 --> 05:22.033
- I don't mind.
- What's wrong, Eep? Not daring enough

05:22.068 --> 05:25.317
to yell in the middle
of a crowded watering hole?

05:25.401 --> 05:26.869
[clears throat]

05:26.870 --> 05:29.072
I wet my pelts!

05:48.674 --> 05:51.427

Right on.
And Ugga, you look real hot.

Yay.

more willing to do dumb stuff.

06:09.154 --> 06:11.906
- You're inspiring.
- Wow, thanks.

06:11.990 --> 06:14.324
Usually when I do dumb stuff, people say,

06:14.408 --> 06:18.163
"Why?" Or, "Look out!"
Or, "That poor boy."

06:18.246 --> 06:22.167
You did it, Thunk.
I bet on the wrong Crood.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.627

No, wait.
This dare-off isn't over!

06:28.173 --> 06:30.049
I'm sorry, who are you?

06:30.133 --> 06:35.888
- Poof. Forgotten.
- I still have one more dare for you, Thunk.

06:35.972 --> 06:41.227
I dare you to jump...
into the deep end.

06:42.478 --> 06:46.316
The deep end?
But it's dangerous and deep and...

06:46.398 --> 06:50.278
- End.
- [gasps] What's the matter? Chickuna?

06:50.360 --> 06:53.489
Oh, well, back to the shallow end
with the little kids.

06:53.972 --> 06:55.491
Right here waitin', buddy.

06:56.826 --> 07:00.496
You're on.
Nobody out-dares the Thunkster.

07:00.579 --> 07:05.668
Oh, Mr. Sun, I will dance
with you on the ice block.

07:05.751 --> 07:08.171

On the count of three.

No sitting, no talking,

Stop pouting about the scream team.
Just try out again.

14:21.186 --> 14:25.274
You're a Crood, and Croods do not
back down from any challenge.

14:25.357 --> 14:29.278
Uh, you backed down from
fighting the moon last night.

14:29.361 --> 14:31.196

I did not.
