00:25.035 --> 00:27.554
Hey, Lis,
there's your boyfriend.

00:33.670 --> 00:36.415
Oh, yeah? Well, there's
your girlfriend.

00:40.653 --> 00:42.674
Yeah, well,
you love Moleman.

00:42.690 --> 00:45.691
No, you do.
You're gay for Moleman!

00:45.700 --> 00:46.839
You're gay for Moleman!

00:49.581 --> 00:52.306
No one's gay for Moleman.

00:57.437 --> 01:00.002
Where are we?
- You're gay for Moleman!

01:00.164 --> 01:01.769
Bart, Lisa, welcome.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.259
I've been expecting you.

01:06.522 --> 01:08.463
Your gasps are appropriate,

01:08.631 --> 01:11.729
because I have perfectly
predicted the future.

01:13.560 --> 01:14.971
How did you know
we were coming?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.205
Because, my dear,

01:16.362 --> 01:18.956
I have mastered
the one true science:

01:19.126 --> 01:20.600
astrology.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.404
Don't you mean astronomy?

01:22.585 --> 01:24.616
No, my dear,
I said astrology.

01:24.724 --> 01:25.710
For years, you see,

01:25.795 --> 01:29.805
astrology was the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays of the sciences...

01:29.854 --> 01:31.049
not so good.

01:31.213 --> 01:34.000
But with new,
more powerful computers,

01:34.037 --> 01:36.482
astrology can show you
the future.

01:36.646 --> 01:39.328
Would you like to see
yourselves as teenagers?

01:39.481 --> 01:40.205
No.

01:40.359 --> 01:41.586
Let's go there now.

01:41.964 --> 01:44.083
Feast your eyes on
the wondrous world

01:44.219 --> 01:46.672
of eight years
from Tuesday.

02:06.891 --> 02:09.543
Kids, come down
for your prom photo.

02:12.313 --> 02:13.578
Smile.

02:17.415 --> 02:18.983
Oh, it's so great.

02:18.990 --> 02:22.429
We can do anything now that
scientists have invented magic.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.161
I'm so proud of you.

02:24.343 --> 02:27.368
Lisa, graduating
two years early,

02:27.516 --> 02:28.471
and, Bart...

02:29.771 --> 02:31.335
graduating.

02:32.269 --> 02:33.269
What'd I miss?
What'd I miss?

02:33.442 --> 02:35.934
Homer,
we're separated now.

02:36.132 --> 02:38.484
You can't just walk in
without knocking.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.950
Well, maybe I was partying so hard

02:41.025 --> 02:42.763
with my single friends last night,

02:42.946 --> 02:44.887
I forgot the rules.

02:44.890 --> 02:47.462
Could you please stop
fighting in front of us?

02:47.686 --> 02:50.209
Why? Is it
messing you up?

02:51.757 --> 02:53.274
Homer, just
settle down.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.244
We just got a postcard
from Maggie.

02:56.617 --> 02:59.163
She's really
enjoying Alaska.

03:03.902 --> 03:05.131
Stupid wildlife,

03:05.192 --> 03:06.030
serves 'em right.

03:08.497 --> 03:10.524
Lisa, your date's here.

03:10.710 --> 03:11.863
Hey, Lisa.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.533
Milhouse?! Ugh!

03:13.674 --> 03:16.705
I've been turning him down
for the prom since kindergarten.

03:16.870 --> 03:17.627
Uh, yes.

03:17.694 --> 03:18.879
You relented at age 12

03:19.057 --> 03:21.310
when he pulled you
out of a house fire.

03:21.311 --> 03:23.261
Which you later
found out he started.

03:23.395 --> 03:25.415
You should have seen
the look on your face.

03:25.554 --> 03:26.525
In fact, here it is.

03:28.104 --> 03:29.439
Now, back to your teens.

03:29.780 --> 03:31.544
Sorry I'm late, Lisa.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.407
I was at the gym,
totally gunning my lats.

03:34.465 --> 03:35.850
Just gunning them.

03:37.778 --> 03:38.695
Oh, man.

03:38.842 --> 03:41.907
The deposit on this tux
was 200 Reagans.

03:43.532 --> 03:44.303
Hey, everybody.

03:44.456 --> 03:46.706
Bart, you're lookin'
crook-ed.

03:46.887 --> 03:48.784
Hey, Jenda, how 'bout
some forehead?

03:50.845 --> 03:53.124
That was jagged.

03:53.284 --> 03:54.667
when I was a kid

03:54.702 --> 03:57.057
we didn't show our affection
by head-butting.

03:57.384 --> 03:58.968
Oh, Marge...

04:02.501 --> 04:04.132
Oh, right.

04:04.293 --> 04:05.212
Separated.

04:10.445 --> 04:12.461
Who knew that
bio-engineered food

04:12.603 --> 04:14.248
would to lead to smart puke?

04:16.824 --> 04:19.158
You think you're
better than me, eh, puke?

04:25.606 --> 04:28.075
So, Nelson, who did you
end up bringing tonight?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.377
Sherri or Terri?

04:29.538 --> 04:31.865
Uh, it didn't seem fair
to choose.

04:35.915 --> 04:39.446
Welcome, seniors and sexually
precocious underclassmen.

04:39.593 --> 04:40.819
I'd like to say good-bye

04:40.858 --> 04:42.601
to those who are going off
to college,

04:42.770 --> 04:44.770
or to fight in Gulf War Five:

04:44.771 --> 04:46.818
"Operation Find
Our President's Head."

04:46.990 --> 04:52.792
USA. Find the head.
USA. Find the head.

04:52.988 --> 04:55.337
And now, here's
Assistant Principal Kearney.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.002
Okay, I want a nice, clean prom.

04:58.186 --> 05:00.308
That means no booze, kick,

05:00.468 --> 05:04.266
puff, doze, maxx, stim or turb.

05:04.467 --> 05:06.442
Remember, "Stim Kills."

05:06.622 --> 05:10.370
It's  what turned Superintendent
Chalmers into a vegetable.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.948
Skinner. Skinner. Skinner.

05:17.908 --> 05:19.575
I can use
the potty now.

05:38.568 --> 05:42.123
Your brother is so hot.
- Stop telling me that.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.744
Oh, sorry, Lisa.
Sink activate.

05:44.944 --> 05:47.870
I love your dress.
Soap activate.

05:48.157 --> 05:49.444
Bart tells me
you got into Yale.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.035
Sink terminate.

05:51.221 --> 05:53.462
Yeah, even though
McDonald's owns Yale now,

05:53.477 --> 05:54.555
it's still a great school.

05:54.721 --> 05:56.342
And I could never
afford to go there

05:56.473 --> 05:58.689
if I hadn't won the Montgomery
Burns Scholarship.

05:58.957 --> 06:00.572
Oh, yeah, that's the thing
he had to do

06:00.719 --> 06:02.386
as punishment
for stealing Christmas.

06:02.561 --> 06:05.199
Yeah.
I miss Christmas.

06:05.351 --> 06:06.015
I don't.

06:15.067 --> 06:17.809
So, any plans
after graduation?

06:17.852 --> 06:18.606
Travel.

06:18.773 --> 06:21.226
Do you need a traveling
companion, perchance?

06:21.406 --> 06:22.577
Travel canceled.

06:27.666 --> 06:28.859
Whoa, look out!

06:29.028 --> 06:32.249
Bart, are you sure about
this limo driver you hired?

06:34.611 --> 06:36.832
I can fly. I can fly.

06:37.042 --> 06:38.962
Just kidding,
I know I can't fly.

06:39.127 --> 06:40.837
I can glide, though.

06:54.400 --> 06:56.570
Jenda, I think we're ready
to go all the way.

06:56.796 --> 06:58.406
But I'm a little nervous.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.958
Bart, don't be
nervous.

07:00.156 --> 07:03.361
Sex  on prom night is as
American as our 51st state:

07:03.524 --> 07:04.641
Saudi-Israelia.

07:04.796 --> 07:07.192
Jenda, that's not
what I meant.

07:07.372 --> 07:08.629
I love you.

07:08.799 --> 07:10.146
Will you marry me?

07:11.355 --> 07:13.099
That's really sweet...

07:13.844 --> 07:16.042
but marriage is
a three-year commitment.

07:16.241 --> 07:19.673
I mean, do you even know what
you're gonna do with your life?

07:19.690 --> 07:21.185
I've got it
all figured out.

07:21.347 --> 07:23.773
You can waitress
while I learn to cut meat.

07:23.970 --> 07:25.026
We'll live in a trailer,

07:25.179 --> 07:26.619
but to avoid
paying for parking,

07:26.800 --> 07:28.833
I'll drive
while you sleep.

07:29.004 --> 07:30.425
We'll never, ever stop.

07:31.318 --> 07:32.168
Bart, I hate to say this,

07:32.312 --> 07:33.892
But I think I outgrew you.

07:34.056 --> 07:35.647
When?
- Just this minute.

07:39.674 --> 07:41.624
Okay, love birds.
Break it up.

07:41.802 --> 07:46.014
Hey, this one's alone.
What a loser.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.642
Here, you want
some chicken?

07:51.612 --> 07:52.501
Just grab it with
your hands,

07:52.502 --> 07:53.952
go ahead.
We're not fancy here.

08:02.425 --> 08:03.659
I'm tired of this.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.494
I want to look
at a different future.

08:07.974 --> 08:09.512
Kang and Kodos Invasion

08:09.651 --> 08:11.089
Vice-President Cletus

08:11.220 --> 08:12.521
Moe Gets E-mail

08:12.768 --> 08:14.015
Flander's Revenge

08:14.260 --> 08:15.549
Maggie's D.U.I.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.095
Lenny's Super Pet

08:20.156 --> 08:22.702
So that's how
Jenda dumped me.

08:22.872 --> 08:25.425
Son, sometimes people
just grow apart,

08:25.599 --> 08:27.004
like me and your mom.

08:27.189 --> 08:28.260
No, Mom dumped you

08:28.265 --> 08:30.733
'cause you blew all our money
on this underwater house.

08:32.225 --> 08:35.063
She'll realize
she was a fool, when...

08:35.207 --> 08:37.682
Hey! Come back
with my patio furniture!

08:39.155 --> 08:40.494
Stupid flounders.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.394
Hey, I've got a great idea.

08:42.571 --> 08:44.371
We'll find
some new lady friends.

08:44.580 --> 08:47.205
Come on, boy,
we're hitting the town.

08:50.350 --> 08:52.059
After decompressing,
of course.

08:58.172 --> 09:01.250
So... what do you do
to kill time in here?

09:01.272 --> 09:03.435
There's a DVD player,
but it doesn't work.

09:08.458 --> 09:11.040
Why'd you buy
the first hover car ever made?

09:11.254 --> 09:14.187
Didn't you know it'd take time
to work out the kinks?

09:14.577 --> 09:17.184
I know! It's a hover car!

09:18.297 --> 09:21.254
What a beautiful world
this will be

09:22.171 --> 09:25.326
What a glorious time
to be free.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.734
All right! You guys
are my new best friends.

09:29.928 --> 09:31.170
You wish, loser!

09:34.019 --> 09:37.260
Plastic Surgery Center :
Celebrity Buttocks,
Nipple Relocations and Fluffy Tails

09:42.274 --> 09:44.388
Give Apes the Vote
You won't regret it

09:53.204 --> 09:54.938
Hey, Moe, hey, Moe-clone.

09:55.051 --> 09:56.868
Hiya Homer.
- Hi, Homer.

09:57.060 --> 09:58.864
Hey, hey, hey!
I don't pay you to socialize.

09:59.042 --> 10:01.246
Oh, right. You're the
people person.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.356
Watch it with
the attitude, mister.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.908
You came from
my back fat!

10:05.140 --> 10:07.504
Boy, I think I see

10:07.650 --> 10:09.976
my two favorite letters
of the alphabet:

10:10.147 --> 10:11.792
E-Z.

10:15.354 --> 10:16.250
You moron!

10:16.402 --> 10:18.523
Why did I ever think
I needed a clone?

10:18.702 --> 10:20.941
Hey, I'm not the clone,
you're the clone!

10:21.164 --> 10:23.049
Oh, please, not this again.

10:25.487 --> 10:27.976
Son, say hello to Edna.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.635
Dad, that's
my fourth grade teacher!

10:34.868 --> 10:36.104
Hi, Mrs. K.

10:36.941 --> 10:38.380
This is sure weird, huh?

10:38.560 --> 10:40.394
Want it to get weirder?

10:41.796 --> 10:43.505
I... don't think so.

10:43.699 --> 10:44.553
Good call, Bart.

10:44.715 --> 10:45.769
We can both do better.

10:46.772 --> 10:49.686
I wish I could talk to my
fourth-grade self just once.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.606
I'd say "Work hard,
don't be such a screw up."

10:52.805 --> 10:54.621
This time is so precious.

10:54.799 --> 10:55.640
Don't waste it.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.603
Bart, maybe you
should listen to this.

10:58.768 --> 11:00.400
Oh! Now I have to start over.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.150
Is  that robot break-dancing?

11:09.400 --> 11:12.450
No. He activated his self-destruct mechanism.

11:14.103 --> 11:15.850
Love  can really be painful.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.168
Tell me about it.

11:17.418 --> 11:18.753
I broke up with Milhouse.

11:19.003 --> 11:20.217
How'd he take it?

11:23.317 --> 11:25.356
What Lisa's problem?

11:25.606 --> 11:28.606
Milhouse mother say Milhouse handsome!

11:33.000 --> 11:36.059
I guess everyone in this family
is doomed to wind up alone.

11:36.309 --> 11:40.550
Look, if you want Jenda to take you back
you should show some initiative; get a job.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.353
A career? No problem.

11:42.603 --> 11:44.050
I speak three languages.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.368
Armpit noises are not a language.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.168
Oh, yeah?

11:49.653 --> 11:54.467
Look, my point is, show Jenda you want
to be successful and she might take you back.

11:54.717 --> 11:56.606
It's never too late for love.

11:56.856 --> 11:59.550
I  am so glad you think so.

11:59.800 --> 12:04.450
Kids, I want you to know I've started seeing someone.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.053
He's from Springfield.

12:06.303 --> 12:07.503
I think you know him.

12:08.818 --> 12:11.818
Krusty the Clown is dating your mom!

12:15.053 --> 12:19.053
When Jenda hears about my great new career,
she'll definitely take me back.

12:26.517 --> 12:27.717
You missed a spot.

12:28.506 --> 12:29.450
Do it again!

12:29.700 --> 12:30.629
Yes, Mr. Gheet.

12:30.879 --> 12:33.029
I'm Anoop, you racist cracker!

12:34.300 --> 12:36.953
Bart, I need you to make a
delivery to an elderly shut-in.

12:37.203 --> 12:41.150
And to get there, you must
go through the forbidden zone.

12:41.400 --> 12:45.068
Which one? Radioactive, smallpox, eternal midnight....

12:45.318 --> 12:48.318
No, no. The one with the uni-clams.

13:09.103 --> 13:09.867
I get it.

13:10.117 --> 13:11.956
You can't tip me because your hands are tied.

13:12.206 --> 13:14.329
My Dad pulls that scam all the time.

13:14.779 --> 13:17.259
Don't move, teenage Bart.

13:17.509 --> 13:20.759
I've got you covered
with my phaser-slash-cell phone.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.753
Dude, this is totally not the time to call me.

13:27.003 --> 13:27.850
I don't know.

13:28.100 --> 13:28.868
Some kind of pasta.

13:29.118 --> 13:31.668
Look, just get me what you're having, all right?

13:32.113 --> 13:33.113
Not that.

13:34.817 --> 13:36.817
What soups do they have...?

13:41.056 --> 13:41.850
Blessed urchin!

13:42.100 --> 13:44.150
How can I reward you?

13:45.079 --> 13:45.750
With the diamond?

13:46.000 --> 13:46.553
No, sorry.

13:46.803 --> 13:48.850
My diamonds are going to be retro-morphed into coal...

13:49.100 --> 13:51.368
the most valuable substance on Earth.

13:51.718 --> 13:55.303
I know. I'll send you to Yale
with the Monty Burns Scholarship.

13:55.553 --> 13:56.767
I can't take your scholarship!

13:57.017 --> 13:59.156
It's going to my sister.
It would break her heart.

13:59.406 --> 14:01.450
Don't be so quick to say no.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.429
The ladies love an ivy-leaguer...

14:03.679 --> 14:04.650
They do?

14:05.900 --> 14:10.900
Once I home-invaded this Princeton dude,
and he was like totally married.

14:12.003 --> 14:14.750
Well, I guess an intensive four-year
bachelor of arts program

14:15.000 --> 14:16.668
is the easiest way to get Jenda back.

14:16.918 --> 14:17.703
Hello, Smithers.

14:17.953 --> 14:18.967
Nice of you to drop by...

14:19.217 --> 14:20.706
after my life was saved.

14:20.956 --> 14:22.250
Sir, you knew I was on a date.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.829
Mr. Smithers?

14:24.079 --> 14:25.250
I thought you were...

14:25.500 --> 14:27.053
you know...

14:27.303 --> 14:28.450
No, I'm straight.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.750
As long as I take these injections every ten minutes.

14:32.818 --> 14:33.818
I love boobies!

14:34.853 --> 14:38.767
It's so great that Yale has finally
forbidden men from taking science.

14:39.017 --> 14:43.156
Now let's see, should I major
in Femistry or Galgebra?

14:43.406 --> 14:46.050
Listen, Lis, I've gotta tell you something.

14:46.300 --> 14:47.053
I'm going to Yale.

14:47.303 --> 14:50.250
What? I don't want to go to
the same college as you.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.468
Then I've got some great news!

14:51.718 --> 14:53.668
You're not going to Yale!

14:57.653 --> 14:59.667
Hey, I didn't do anything!

14:59.917 --> 15:00.917
Yet.

15:02.756 --> 15:04.050
You've wrecked my life!

15:04.300 --> 15:06.550
You're gonna wreck my life!

15:12.509 --> 15:14.150
Hey, Marge, why are you with Krusty?

15:14.400 --> 15:15.853
These kids are too old for clowns.

15:16.103 --> 15:19.750
Actually, Homer, I'm... into your lady.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.568
Hey, man, she's not my lady anymore.

15:22.818 --> 15:24.568
We split up, it's all cool...

15:24.818 --> 15:26.618
I... I'll kill you!

15:29.153 --> 15:30.767
Once they destroy each other...

15:31.017 --> 15:32.306
Then we make our move.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.656
Yes, we make our move.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.229
What? A spider got into the cloning machine.

15:38.579 --> 15:39.579
Attention, everyone.

15:39.600 --> 15:43.053
Please welcome our valedictorian, Lisa Simpson.

15:43.303 --> 15:45.853
She will be attending Yale...

15:48.400 --> 15:52.568
I mean, Hot Dog on a Stick Management Camp.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.003
That's odd.

15:54.253 --> 15:57.267
You get into Yale and Lisa can't go anymore?

15:57.517 --> 15:58.306
Hey, what can I say.

15:58.556 --> 15:59.050
I love learning.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.859
Bartholomew Simpson!

16:01.109 --> 16:01.650
What?

16:01.900 --> 16:03.753
Come and get your diploma.

16:04.003 --> 16:05.750
Why don't you mail it to your butt?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.868
Bart, now that you've graduated
I can finally say this:

16:09.118 --> 16:12.118
you really press my cider.

16:16.503 --> 16:19.667
Yo, Bart, good to see you're back with Jenda.

16:19.917 --> 16:20.606
Hey, Nelson.

16:20.856 --> 16:22.529
What's up with your girlfriends?

16:22.779 --> 16:25.550
They each had twins.

16:25.800 --> 16:30.053
Listen, girls... I'm going
out for a pack of cigarettes.

16:30.303 --> 16:33.350
Isn't that what your father
said the day he left you?

16:33.600 --> 16:36.268
Yeah. I never understood why he did it...

16:36.518 --> 16:37.453
till now.

16:37.703 --> 16:40.053
I'm coming, Papa!

16:45.817 --> 16:49.256
Lisa had no right to break up with me.

16:49.506 --> 16:53.506
I'm not the first guy to get
a nosebleed during a slow dance.

16:55.100 --> 16:56.159
I'd better go talk to him.

16:56.409 --> 16:59.050
Well, don't take too long.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.300
I think this might be our special night.

17:04.502 --> 17:05.950
Why did Lisa dump me?

17:06.200 --> 17:08.468
Is it because of my small calves?

17:08.718 --> 17:10.973
They're the hardest place to add mass!

17:11.223 --> 17:11.867
Cheer up, Milhouse.

17:12.117 --> 17:14.306
You got your whole life ahead of you.

17:17.556 --> 17:21.050
Hey, I remember when you were
a nerdy little fourth-grader.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.868
And now you're an emotionally
crippled mini-Hulk.

17:24.118 --> 17:25.450
What girl wouldn't want that?

17:25.700 --> 17:28.953
Do you think Lisa might see that
now that she's got nothing else?

17:29.203 --> 17:30.403
I guess so.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.000
Time to strike while the iron is sad!

17:36.218 --> 17:37.193
All right.

17:37.443 --> 17:39.943
Three hours to blast my quads.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.906
Bart, what's wrong?

17:49.156 --> 17:50.450
You seem distracted.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.979
I was just thinking about Milhouse and Lisa.

17:54.229 --> 17:56.429
What are you thinking about now?

17:58.200 --> 18:01.600
Hey, that rundown old house looks familiar.

18:02.003 --> 18:04.750
That's where Doc Frink used to live.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
I never had this problem with Todd Flanders.

18:15.018 --> 18:16.973
This machine lets us look into the future.

18:17.223 --> 18:18.867
Wouldn't that be romantic?

18:19.117 --> 18:20.706
I'll tell you what would be romantic.

18:20.956 --> 18:23.529
Making love for the first time.

18:23.779 --> 18:26.879
Totally. Right after I fiddle
with these dials and levers.

18:33.100 --> 18:37.453
You know, I was thinking of taking
a poetry class at the community college.

18:37.703 --> 18:38.350
Forget it.

18:38.600 --> 18:42.150
I had to sell all my marrow to pay the light bill.

18:43.918 --> 18:46.268
I didn't have much marrow.

18:46.553 --> 18:47.967
I can't let that happen.

18:48.217 --> 18:49.106
I got to go.

18:49.356 --> 18:53.750
Listen, Bart, if you leave me now, I can
guarantee one thing about your future--

18:54.000 --> 18:55.350
I won't be in it.

18:57.979 --> 19:00.150
Not going to Yale isn't the end of the world.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.153
Yeah, I'm starting to see that.

19:02.403 --> 19:05.050
No, I mean, you're screwed.

19:05.300 --> 19:07.868
Your only hope is to clutch at straws.

19:08.118 --> 19:10.453
Straws who've always loved you.

19:10.703 --> 19:11.267
Really?

19:11.517 --> 19:12.817
Really.

19:13.206 --> 19:14.506
Ca-can I kiss you?

19:15.800 --> 19:17.359
Have you eaten onions lately?

19:17.609 --> 19:21.659
No. And it's really hard 'cause
I'm on an all-onion diet.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.053
well... okay.

19:26.303 --> 19:28.303
I guess this is my destiny.

19:32.100 --> 19:33.068
What are you doing?

19:33.318 --> 19:35.103
Keeping Lisa from destroying her life.

19:35.353 --> 19:37.553
Come on, let her destroy it.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.306
Lenny, Carl, can you pull me out?

19:48.556 --> 19:50.050
Sorry, we're ghosts now.

19:50.300 --> 19:52.229
Our spirits live in those two trees.

19:52.479 --> 19:55.550
Or, maybe we're alive and we
just feel like jerkin' you around.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
Or maybe we're one of each.

20:01.103 --> 20:03.150
Look, I'm not taking the scholarship.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.368
You're the one who deserves to go to Yale.

20:05.618 --> 20:07.503
That's so noble.

20:07.753 --> 20:08.667
But what about Jenda?

20:08.917 --> 20:12.706
Hey, I'm waiting till I find
a girl who likes me for me.

20:12.956 --> 20:13.829
And you will.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.250
At the age of 83.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.953
You die one minute later.

20:18.203 --> 20:20.150
And my brain is put in a...

20:20.400 --> 20:21.368
Pauper's grave.

20:21.618 --> 20:25.503
Well, Bart, I really appreciate
what you're going to do for me.

20:25.753 --> 20:28.153
But what happens to our parents?

20:31.217 --> 20:33.506
Marge, I thought you'd never take me back after

20:33.756 --> 20:35.016
what I did to Krusty.

20:35.266 --> 20:36.950
You mean get beaten up by him?

20:37.200 --> 20:38.450
Exactly.

20:38.809 --> 20:42.550
And I'll admit, it is kind
of romantic under the sea.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.953
You don't know the half of it.

20:51.403 --> 20:58.950
Come  with me my love to the sea

20:59.200 --> 21:04.768
The sea of love I want to tell you

21:05.018 --> 21:09.518
how much I love you...

21:11.503 --> 21:12.067
This sucks.

21:12.317 --> 21:14.106
I want to see Vice President Cletus.

21:14.356 --> 21:18.850
You want me to attend the
funeral of the Sultan of Brunei?

21:19.100 --> 21:22.059
Well, I would consider it my honor.

21:22.309 --> 21:25.950
Hey, Brandine, pack my evenin' britches.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.550
We's goin' to Brunei.
