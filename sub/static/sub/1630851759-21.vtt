I love going
to church,

00:06.840 --> 00:07.966
but nothing
prepared me for

00:07.966 --> 00:10.469
the after‐church
brunches.
I'm stuffed.

00:10.469 --> 00:13.847
I am so full,
my belly button went
from an innie to an outie.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.141
And now for
the best part...

00:16.141 --> 00:17.518
All: (sighs)
Ahh!

00:18.477 --> 00:21.813
I told y'all to pace yourself,
but you never learn.

00:22.940 --> 00:25.442
I think that was
the best brunch yet.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.236
The Franklins were
such great hosts.

00:27.236 --> 00:28.987
Yeah, they made
me feel so at home,

00:28.987 --> 00:30.572
I accidentally
told another guest,

00:30.572 --> 00:32.199
"Thanks for
stopping by."

00:33.825 --> 00:34.701
You know what?

00:34.701 --> 00:35.869
Everyone's hosted us.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.955
Isn't it time
that we host them?

We have to do it
at least once before

Lexi moves back
to Savannah.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.834
You'd do that for me?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.003
Lexi, we'd do
anything for you.

00:45.003 --> 00:46.296
‐Copy that.
‐Wow.

Cooking for the entire
church congregation?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.174
That's a tall order,

00:49.883 --> 00:51.260
but I think we
can pull it off.

00:51.260 --> 00:54.054
We better.
We have a saying
back in Savannah,

Grandma, you'll be
in charge of music.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.949
you always laugh
when Uncle Max

01:55.949 --> 01:57.075
tells those jokes.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.285
What can I say?

01:58.285 --> 01:59.453

Dad, you and Lexi
will be in charge

Whoa.
That's a lot of food.

five days,

02:17.179 --> 02:18.347

our tasks.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.183
Yes, it's intense,

church brunches
the same day.

all that work

if you felt the same way.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.710
That's why I didn't
say anything!

18:06.127 --> 18:07.670
Well,

18:07.670 --> 18:10.089
looks like we're
both pretty sure now.

18:10.798 --> 18:12.550
Looks like we are.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.635
♪

18:23.227 --> 18:25.104
Lydia, please tell me
you brought some
extra paprika.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.105
I just ran out.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.982
In my trunk
underneath
the spare tire.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.443
The car was gettin'
really full.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.155
Paprika.
Spare tire.
On it.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.116
Thanks again for
all your help, Lydia.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.201
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.620
I can tell you this,

18:40.620 --> 18:42.955
you would've had a pretty
uncomfortable day at church.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.667
Hey, can I ask
you something?

18:46.959 --> 18:47.877
Sure.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.756
Why did you offer
to help me after
I acted so selfishly?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.674
You were in need,

18:54.091 --> 18:55.217
and that's what we do.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.304
Church community is
about coming together.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.806
Sometimes to help,
sometimes to eat,

19:01.432 --> 19:02.933
this time it's both.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.226
Yeah.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.187
Starting to get that now.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.357
Sydney, how are those
pork chops coming?

19:09.357 --> 19:10.608
According to
my spreadsheet,

19:10.608 --> 19:12.193
they should be
seasoned by now.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.778
Oh. We're almost done.

19:13.778 --> 19:15.112
Almost isn't
gonna cut it.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.448
Sorry.

19:17.448 --> 19:18.658
In my defense,
I scheduled me

19:18.658 --> 19:20.493
to snap at someone
20 minutes ago.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.580
Okay.
I found the paprika
under the tire,

19:24.580 --> 19:26.832
and I found some broccoli
in the glove compartment.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.042
Oh, that's not broccoli,

19:28.042 --> 19:29.418
so you should probably
throw that out.

19:31.504 --> 19:34.965
(shouts)
I hear a lotta talkin',
but not a lotta cookin'.

19:35.925 --> 19:37.176
I love that, Lexi.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.427
Have you ever
tried this one?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.845
Let's shake it, people!

19:40.179 --> 19:41.889
Ooh, I'm gonna use that.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.310
Okay.
Mac and cheese
is oven ready,

19:46.310 --> 19:48.437
so check me off, Olive.
(chuckles)

19:49.897 --> 19:51.148
Uh, what's all this?

19:51.482 --> 19:54.151
Oh, my cornbread,
and it's nowhere near done.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.111
Yeah, but after
the mac and cheese,

19:55.111 --> 19:56.529
I've gotta put
the candied yams in.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.614
Oh no.
And what about
the peach cobbler,

19:58.989 --> 20:00.366
and the pork chops,

20:00.366 --> 20:03.035
and the 15 other dishes
that need to be baked?

20:03.452 --> 20:04.620
What are we gonna do?

20:04.620 --> 20:06.831
We need a lotta ovens,
and we need 'em quick.

20:06.831 --> 20:07.832
Okay.
How 'bout this?

20:08.082 --> 20:10.126
I gave Sister Shonda
a ride home last week.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.168
She lives up the street.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.587
I'm sure she'd be more than
happy to lend us her oven.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.215
Lydia, that's a great idea.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.136
Hey, why don't I go grab
the church directory?

20:20.428 --> 20:23.097
I'm sure there are other members
who would lend us their oven.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.348
Now you're gettin' it.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.058
Lettin' people be
there for you.

20:26.308 --> 20:27.518
I'd offer my oven,

20:27.518 --> 20:30.521
but my brothers
dry their hockey
pants in there.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.106
♪

20:35.735 --> 20:37.194
Oh.
I just got a text
from Grandma.

20:37.194 --> 20:39.905
Church is over,
and everyone'll
be here any second.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.116
13, 14...

20:42.116 --> 20:43.617
Wait.
Where's the mac and cheese?

20:43.617 --> 20:46.996
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
Ooh!

20:47.538 --> 20:48.998
Next time we
ask neighbors
to cook for us,

20:48.998 --> 20:50.875
remind me
to bring
oven mitts.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.337
Okay.
I got six more serving spoons
from Sister Angela.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.923
I asked for forks,
but love thy neighbor.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.595
Well, butter me up
and call me a biscuit.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.764
This place looks great!

21:05.181 --> 21:06.724
You got here fast.

21:06.724 --> 21:09.226
We wanted to get here in case
you needed any last minute help.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.228
Uh, nope.
We finished right
before you got here.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.147
(softly)
Looks like we
timed it perfectly.

21:15.191 --> 21:18.027
Oh, Pastor Moore, welcome.

21:18.027 --> 21:20.863
Thank you, Sydney.
And thank you for hosting.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.699
It's always a blessing
to see our entire community

21:23.699 --> 21:27.870
sharing a meal like this
with such fine desserts.

21:28.162 --> 21:31.373
Pastor Moore, you're thinkin'
about the cobbler, aren't you?

21:31.373 --> 21:33.250
Amen to that.

21:33.584 --> 21:34.835
Right this way.

21:37.213 --> 21:38.380
(sighs)

21:39.715 --> 21:41.008
Look at this.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.302
‐We did it.
‐Sure did.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.638
This backyard
never disappoints.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.723
We created a lot
of memories back here.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.475
Your 13th birthday.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.227
And Syd's 13th birthday.

21:51.227 --> 21:53.813
Olive and I had our
first playdate back here.

21:54.814 --> 21:56.649
First time I met
your Mom was back here.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.026
When I bought
this house,
I never knew

21:59.026 --> 22:00.152
three generations

22:00.152 --> 22:01.695
would be passing
through it.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.614
Thanks for letting me
be a part of it.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.200
Of course you're
a part of it.
You're family.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.369
No.
You're more than family.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.037
You're Olive.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.372
Aw.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.084
Look at this
beautiful family.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.044
Hey, how 'bout
a photo of you all?

22:17.044 --> 22:18.170
Great idea.

22:19.463 --> 22:21.465
Everybody say,
"Sydney."

22:21.465 --> 22:22.383
Lydia:
Ready?

22:22.383 --> 22:24.677
One, two, three.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.637
‐All: Sydney!

22:29.139 --> 22:31.976
Isn't this great?
Everybody's having
so much fun.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.562
I couldn't be happier if
I had another pork chop.

22:34.562 --> 22:37.064
Ooh, maybe I should have
another pork chop.

22:38.023 --> 22:40.192
This is so perfect
I might cry.

22:41.318 --> 22:42.736

Here come
the waterworks.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.655
Right on time.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.534
(teary)
Put a check down
for me, too.

22:49.034 --> 22:52.079
(teary)
Oh no, it's contagious.
I'll take two checks.

22:53.247 --> 22:54.707
Come on, folks!
