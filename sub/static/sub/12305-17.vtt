00:18.821 --> 00:21.782
That son of a bitch doesn't
know what he's talking about.

00:21.824 --> 00:24.117
We've been over this a hundred times.

00:24.159 --> 00:26.578
Can we just talk about
this a little later?

00:26.620 --> 00:28.622
I promise, okay? okay!

00:28.705 --> 00:30.082
I promise.

01:06.535 --> 01:09.037
Found a letterhead in
our vic's papers here.

01:09.079 --> 01:12.249
It's from a Creighton &
Howe, law firm next door.

01:12.291 --> 01:13.959
He was a partner there.

01:16.044 --> 01:18.380
What did he specialize in, Frank?

01:18.463 --> 01:21.550
Civil lit beat, class
action, small-time stuff.

01:21.592 --> 01:23.218
His name's Sean Radley.

01:23.594 --> 01:25.971
Think maybe a dissatisfied client?

01:26.555 --> 01:29.683
There's a lot of anger
behind this, Frank.

01:29.975 --> 01:31.477
That's his car.

01:32.227 --> 01:34.146
He sure didn't get very far.

01:34.229 --> 01:36.106
They didn't want him to escape.

01:39.151 --> 01:41.528
Have to be pretty cold to pull this off.

01:41.737 --> 01:44.031
Not pretty cold, Frank.

01:45.407 --> 01:47.117
Cold-blooded.

02:56.155 --> 02:57.656
Our dead lawyer's briefcase?

02:57.698 --> 02:58.949
It is.

02:59.616 --> 03:00.742
What've you got?

03:00.826 --> 03:03.704
Some kind of impression in the leather.

03:03.787 --> 03:04.746
Can you make them out?

03:05.038 --> 03:06.915
No, I can't.

03:07.166 --> 03:09.668
I'll see if I can get his
contact list off his phone-

03:09.835 --> 03:11.211
it's as dead as he is.

03:12.171 --> 03:14.506
Wait a second, he was
talking on the phone?

03:14.840 --> 03:16.884
Yeah, explains why he
didn't see the car coming.

03:18.218 --> 03:21.555
Who was he talking to?

03:30.647 --> 03:32.191
Hold on, guys.

03:32.983 --> 03:35.611
- Hey, Calleigh.
- Hey.

03:36.278 --> 03:38.447
So this is our
hit-and-run victim, huh?

03:38.822 --> 03:40.449
He was hit hard, honey.

03:40.491 --> 03:42.159
Point of impact was at the knee.

03:42.242 --> 03:46.622
Snapped the femur so hard,
popped the bone clean.

03:46.747 --> 03:49.333
But this is what i wanted you to see.

03:52.461 --> 03:53.879
Looks like oil.

03:53.962 --> 03:55.631
See where the stain starts?

03:55.672 --> 03:58.217
It's above the compound fracture.

03:58.842 --> 04:01.345
That leg bone is as sharp as a knife.

04:01.595 --> 04:04.973
Must have punctured something
underneath the car that ran over him.

04:09.353 --> 04:11.438
well, that means our
car will be leaking.

04:12.231 --> 04:14.942
I'll get this to trace as
soon as I get back, okay?

04:18.529 --> 04:20.738
This is sergeant Tripp, homicide.

04:20.988 --> 04:23.784
I need some phone records
pulled on a Sean Radley.

04:26.328 --> 04:29.623
I heard a bang, I... I thought
sean dropped the phone.

04:29.790 --> 04:31.291
I didn't know he was run over.

04:31.375 --> 04:34.044
Well, what were you and Sean
Radley talking about, Ms. Ross?

04:34.128 --> 04:36.713
Work- I'm his
administrative assistant.

04:36.839 --> 04:38.966
Just usual office stuff.

04:39.091 --> 04:40.634
Yeah, but you called him.

04:41.009 --> 04:42.594
From your home, at 6:00 in the morning.

04:42.636 --> 04:44.680
That's a little early
for work, isn't it?

04:53.939 --> 04:56.483
Sean and I had a fling a few months ago.

04:57.109 --> 04:58.944
I called to talk about it.

04:59.486 --> 05:00.863
Were you still involved?

05:01.822 --> 05:04.366
He broke it off right after it started.

05:04.825 --> 05:06.452
Told me I wasn't his type.

05:06.535 --> 05:07.828
What is his type?

05:08.704 --> 05:09.913
I don't know,

05:10.456 --> 05:11.790
but I know he found her.

05:11.832 --> 05:13.500
What makes you so sure?

05:13.917 --> 05:15.752
Secretary's little secret.

05:16.420 --> 05:20.090
Every morning, I sync my pda
with his so we have the same info.

05:20.174 --> 05:23.469
He forgot he saved a chat
room exchange with her.

05:23.802 --> 05:25.429
You still have your pda?

05:25.512 --> 05:26.430
Here.

05:30.976 --> 05:34.646
Mystery lady says: "We'll
hook up soon, I promise. "

05:34.730 --> 05:38.066
Wizardman says- that's
Sean's screen name-

05:38.609 --> 05:40.319
"don't tease me, angel. "

05:41.695 --> 05:43.530
He never talked to me like that.

05:43.572 --> 05:44.656
You know her name?

05:44.698 --> 05:46.867
Just her first name, Tiffany.

05:48.368 --> 05:50.287
She's probably some stripper.

05:50.996 --> 05:52.498
You can go, Ms. Ross.

05:52.831 --> 05:54.041
We'll be in touch.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.515
Guess what our substance is
off the dead lawyer's shirt.

06:09.556 --> 06:11.975
Uh, well, considering that it came
from the undercarriage of his car,

06:12.017 --> 06:15.145
which was pierced by his
bone, which incidentally I'm...

06:15.187 --> 06:18.857
really glad I wasn't there
to see, my guess is...

06:18.899 --> 06:20.567
motor oil, 10w30.

06:20.692 --> 06:21.902
Try soybeans.

06:21.985 --> 06:23.362
Soybeans, like ethanol?

06:23.487 --> 06:25.239
No, as in bio-diesel.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.990
100% bio-diesel, in fact.

06:27.032 --> 06:29.993
It's rare, so it should make our
hit-and-run car easier to find.

06:30.119 --> 06:33.247
Well, it's nice to know that our
killer cares about the environment.

07:05.612 --> 07:06.822
Is that radley's briefcase?

07:06.864 --> 07:08.157
It is.

07:09.491 --> 07:12.995
I found impressions

07:13.537 --> 07:16.915
inside the layers, but
the leather was too pliant.

07:16.999 --> 07:19.418
And you're hoping the wood
underneath kept the shape.

07:19.460 --> 07:20.836
Not anymore.

07:24.756 --> 07:26.216
What is that, is that a license plate?

07:26.300 --> 07:28.010
It happened during impact.

07:32.181 --> 07:33.682
You know, that may
only be a partial plate,

07:33.724 --> 07:37.978
but we can still find this car,
because it runs on bio-diesel fuel.

07:40.689 --> 07:43.776
Okay, I got six matches.

07:44.401 --> 07:47.070
Look at this, Green Oasis car rental.

07:47.154 --> 07:48.989
Bring up the web site.

07:51.575 --> 07:53.285
It is a car rental company,

07:53.327 --> 07:55.996
and they only rent vehicles
that run on bio-diesel fuel.

07:56.038 --> 07:58.207
Who rented the car?

07:58.248 --> 07:59.416
Got it.

08:05.088 --> 08:10.594
Mrs. Radley, your husband was hit and
killed by a car rented in your name.

08:12.930 --> 08:15.933
I was home all morning... ask my kids.

08:15.974 --> 08:17.309
I'm asking you.

08:18.936 --> 08:20.771
Why would I want to kill my husband?

08:20.813 --> 08:22.231
He was cheating on you,

08:22.314 --> 08:24.650
Mrs. Radley, wasn't he?

08:26.610 --> 08:29.988
I didn't know that for sure,
I just suspected it. he...

08:30.072 --> 08:33.033
He would come home smelling
of perfume cheap stuff and...

08:33.116 --> 08:35.869
Does the name Tiffany ring a bell?

08:37.328 --> 08:40.874
I caught him talking online to somebody
named tiffany about two weeks ago, yes,

08:40.916 --> 08:44.503
but he... He deleted it, and I could
never prove that she was his girlfriend.

08:44.545 --> 08:46.380
Where's your
rent-a-car now?

08:47.464 --> 08:49.550
I think that it was stolen this morning.

08:49.675 --> 08:51.176
Did you report it?

08:51.260 --> 08:52.970
No, lieutenant,

08:53.220 --> 08:56.348
I woke up, and it was gone,
and then sean was dead,

08:56.390 --> 08:59.726
so no, I haven't gotten
around to reporting it yet.

09:00.727 --> 09:02.146
I understand.

09:02.771 --> 09:05.816
Without that car, you
can't hold me here, can you?

09:10.529 --> 09:11.864
But, Mrs. Radley,

09:12.281 --> 09:14.116
I'm gonna find the car.

09:16.452 --> 09:17.453
Frank.

09:17.661 --> 09:19.037
The
rent-a-car.

09:19.705 --> 09:21.248
Here's what we need to do.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.836
<i>All air and ground units in the vicinity,
be on the lookout for a late model,</i>

09:25.878 --> 09:28.547
<i>possibly 2007, all-black charger.</i>

09:28.589 --> 09:33.093
<i>Tinted windows, license
plate number oe225g.</i>

09:33.177 --> 09:36.180
<i>Please be advised the
suspect may be armed.</i>

09:40.559 --> 09:42.186
Nice work, Frank.

09:42.311 --> 09:44.188
I'm afraid I can't take all the credit.

09:44.229 --> 09:46.648
Our bird spotted it on a flyby.

09:46.857 --> 09:48.108
Damage matches
your hit-and-run.

09:48.150 --> 09:50.444
Look underneath, we
got spitting fuel, too.

09:53.238 --> 09:55.073
Wow, this is our car.

09:55.115 --> 09:58.160
Let me know if you find anything that
puts the wife in the driver's seat.

09:58.243 --> 10:00.996
Horatio had her in the hot
seat not 30 minutes ago.

10:10.005 --> 10:11.590
I've got something.

10:13.592 --> 10:14.676
What've you got?

10:14.843 --> 10:19.098
Some sort of a piece of costume
jewelry like you'd put on a fingernail.

10:23.644 --> 10:25.395
looks like something a
woman might find pretty.

10:25.479 --> 10:27.189
I don't know if a grown
woman would wear it.

10:27.272 --> 10:28.690
How old are her kids?

10:28.774 --> 10:32.236
Son brandon is age nine,
daughter hannah is 16.

10:32.319 --> 10:34.113
16- that's
driving age.

10:34.154 --> 10:35.239
Let's bring her in to pd.

10:35.322 --> 10:36.198
I'll do it.

10:41.120 --> 10:44.915
But I don't even have a learner's
permit, so how could I drive the car?

10:45.749 --> 10:50.003
Hannah, your mother said that the
rental car was missing this morning.

10:50.379 --> 10:54.091
And you're the only person
who has access to the keys.

10:54.174 --> 10:56.093
But I was home all morning.

10:58.637 --> 11:00.347
We also, uh...

11:03.183 --> 11:05.060
we found this in the car this morning.

11:07.938 --> 11:08.897
So?

11:09.356 --> 11:12.359
So, I can see you're missing
a jewel from your fingernail.

11:12.651 --> 11:14.653
Whatever. Mine was different.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.491
Besides, it's a rental car;
hundreds of people drive it.

11:19.741 --> 11:22.703
But you know what,
hannah? I think it's yours.

11:25.289 --> 11:28.750
I also think it's hard to
admit something like this.

11:30.711 --> 11:32.212
You know what's hard?

11:32.671 --> 11:35.215
Try your mom and dad getting divorced.

11:37.676 --> 11:41.013
I didn't want my dad dead; i
wanted them to stay together.

11:41.054 --> 11:43.223
Even though your dad was, uh...

11:47.019 --> 11:49.062
He was being unfaithful to your mom?

11:51.774 --> 11:53.400
I didn't know that.

11:55.319 --> 11:57.571
My mom doesn't tell me anything.

11:59.031 --> 12:00.824
So you weren't angry at your dad?

12:01.450 --> 12:02.367
No.

12:03.452 --> 12:05.245
My dad was, like...

12:05.954 --> 12:07.247
my hero.

12:09.666 --> 12:12.503
I was gonna work at his
law firm with him, and...

12:13.837 --> 12:15.214
Now it's over.

12:16.757 --> 12:18.217
It's all over.

12:21.345 --> 12:23.305
Look, can I go home now?

12:26.683 --> 12:28.477
Uh, yeah, of course.

12:28.519 --> 12:30.395
There's an officer
that'll take you home.

12:30.562 --> 12:31.438
Thank you.

12:52.459 --> 12:54.128
What did we get from hannah?

12:54.336 --> 12:55.546
I can't put her in that car.

12:55.587 --> 12:58.215
I can't put her in that
car definitively, no.

12:58.298 --> 13:00.843
Okay, so we need to find this Tiffany.

13:01.426 --> 13:02.678
You're gonna have to make a pit stop.

13:02.761 --> 13:03.720
Why is that?

13:03.762 --> 13:06.432
There's a new murder. There was a
shooting at the eastern light caf?

13:06.473 --> 13:08.058
That's where I'll be.

13:25.325 --> 13:26.952
Thanks for coming in on your day off.

13:26.994 --> 13:28.370
No problem.

13:28.787 --> 13:31.874
Homicide said he was shot, no
one knows from what direction.

13:38.213 --> 13:39.339
Did you get an id on our vic?

13:39.381 --> 13:41.341
No, we don'T. But look
at this green glass.

13:41.383 --> 13:43.010
It's not from the restaurant.

13:43.051 --> 13:45.679
Which means somebody
must have brought it in.

13:52.770 --> 13:54.730
I've seen this guy before.

13:55.314 --> 13:56.690
From another case?

13:56.732 --> 13:57.566
No.

13:57.733 --> 13:58.776
A couple of nights ago,

13:58.817 --> 14:02.070
I was watching that expose
show, predators among us.

14:02.154 --> 14:05.574
This guy was one of the
pedophiles that they caught.

14:05.616 --> 14:06.784
Are you sure?

14:06.909 --> 14:07.743
Yeah.

14:08.577 --> 14:10.662
The show caught him
online with this girl.

14:10.704 --> 14:14.958
And he thought he was coming to see
Tiffany, but instead he got cameras.

14:15.042 --> 14:16.335
Did you say Tiffany?

14:16.376 --> 14:17.294
Yeah.

14:32.102 --> 14:34.354
I just processed the balcony,
and I didn't find anything.

14:34.396 --> 14:36.565
But I think I know why.

14:36.732 --> 14:38.567
Because the shooter cleaned up.

14:38.650 --> 14:40.902
No, I think the shooter
had an accomplice.

14:47.868 --> 14:50.329
so the accomplice may have cleaned up.

14:50.495 --> 14:53.540
The waitress said that she
saw him pick something up.

14:54.541 --> 14:55.709
Maybe a cartridge.

14:55.751 --> 14:59.796
Miss boa vista, I think we're
dealing with a couple of vigilantes.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.299
I'll get a copy of that
predator show right now.

15:10.193 --> 15:12.195
Tiffany, you in there?

15:13.488 --> 15:15.782
<i>We finally get to meet in person.</i>

15:16.825 --> 15:18.702
<i>You got me, instead.</i>

15:18.952 --> 15:20.745
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

15:23.582 --> 15:26.084
<i>Tony... massaro.</i>

15:26.626 --> 15:28.086
Is that our shooting victim?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.755
Yeah. Now we know his
name... Tony Massaro.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.882
You gotta see what he's texting.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.884
They open the show with it.

15:37.637 --> 15:39.598
Hey. Wait a minute.

15:39.931 --> 15:43.143
That's our hit-and-run
victim, Sean Radley.

15:43.185 --> 15:45.312
<i>Tiffany, it's wizardman.</i>

15:45.437 --> 15:47.731
Now we know why he wasn't
interested in his secretary.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.274
She was too old.

15:49.483 --> 15:50.609
Play it through.

15:50.775 --> 15:53.278
<i>Tiffany, it's wizardman.</i>

15:53.361 --> 15:54.946
<i>Hope you're decent.</i>

15:55.489 --> 15:57.199
<i>I'm coming in!</i>

15:58.283 --> 15:59.701
Hi!

15:59.868 --> 16:01.203
<i>You're not Tiffany.</i>

16:01.244 --> 16:02.287
<i>No.</i>

16:02.370 --> 16:05.415
<i>Multicolored condoMs. Cute!</i>

16:05.499 --> 16:06.833
<i>It's not what you think.</i>

16:06.917 --> 16:09.419
So both of our victims are pedophiles.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.129
Yeah, well,

16:11.588 --> 16:14.341
sounds to me like a problem
that took care of itself.

16:14.382 --> 16:15.258
Well, delko...

16:15.342 --> 16:17.636
Look, I don't need a
lecture, Natalia, okay?

16:17.761 --> 16:18.637
I got nieces.

16:18.678 --> 16:21.139
Guys, we really should focus,
because both our shooting victim

16:21.181 --> 16:23.391
and our hit-and-run victim
were on that show last week,

16:23.433 --> 16:24.643
and now they're both dead.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.561
Think there's a vigilante
out there killing these guys?

16:26.645 --> 16:30.273
I don't know, but if there is, every
man on that show is in a lot of trouble.

16:30.315 --> 16:31.358
I'm gonna go over to the studio.

16:31.399 --> 16:33.735
I'll grab wolfe- he
used to work there.

16:39.407 --> 16:42.786
Something tells me you're
not here to get your job back.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.371
No, sorry, heather.

16:44.412 --> 16:45.455
Actually we're here because

16:45.539 --> 16:48.959
two men who were featured on
your show predators among us...

16:49.000 --> 16:50.794
they were murdered today.

16:52.587 --> 16:55.882
Your program provided the motive
for anyone who was watching.

16:56.550 --> 16:58.927
We don't force these guys to show up.

16:58.969 --> 17:00.595
We just shine the light.

17:00.637 --> 17:03.306
It's your job to catch them
before someone kills them.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.933
Well, then why don't
you turn them over to us?

17:04.974 --> 17:06.685
Because we can't hold them.

17:06.768 --> 17:10.146
You know, for the record, I
asked for mdpd involvement,

17:10.188 --> 17:12.148
but they didn't want
anything to do with the show.

17:12.190 --> 17:15.484
That's probably because we view it
as entrapment, not entertainment.

17:15.819 --> 17:18.780
All we need to do is talk with the
girl who spoke with our victims online.

17:18.864 --> 17:19.990
You mean Tiffany?

17:20.073 --> 17:22.617
Yeah, Tiffany. She's the only thing
that those two guys have in common.

17:22.659 --> 17:25.704
Maybe she, uh, knows
something that'll help us.

17:25.787 --> 17:26.788
Wanna meet her?

17:26.954 --> 17:28.248
She's right here.

17:33.962 --> 17:35.297
Here she is.

17:39.384 --> 17:40.218
You're Tiffany?

17:40.260 --> 17:41.052
In the flesh.

17:41.094 --> 17:43.221
Name's lou, but I play
tiff in the chat rooMs.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.931
Hi, lou. So there's no real Tiffany?

17:44.973 --> 17:45.807
Only online.

17:45.891 --> 17:50.270
These freaks think they're talking
to lonely little lolitas, but it's us.

17:50.353 --> 17:51.688
Could you tell us what tony massseo

17:51.730 --> 17:53.565
and aran radley were talking
to "Tiffany" about online

17:53.607 --> 17:54.816
before you caught them at the beach?

17:54.900 --> 17:55.942
We keep all our chats on record.

17:56.026 --> 17:57.777
Just in case you guys come calling.

17:59.070 --> 18:01.698
Here's a transcript we got on tony.

18:02.032 --> 18:03.158
I think this'll help.

18:03.241 --> 18:05.785
He went by "sexyback. "

18:06.036 --> 18:09.289
See? He chatted up
Tiffany for two hours.

18:09.331 --> 18:12.959
The usual sicko stuff-
"I know what girls like,

18:13.043 --> 18:17.047
you can drive my car,
I'll buy you wine coolers. "

18:17.130 --> 18:19.257
Lollipop's my screen name for Tiffany.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.634
Why are we reading this?

18:20.717 --> 18:22.302
Thought you might be
interested in the next part.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.012
Someone pirated into their chat.

18:24.095 --> 18:24.971
Not our lawyer?

18:25.055 --> 18:26.431
No, a new guy.

18:26.515 --> 18:28.141
"Astroboi. "

18:28.266 --> 18:30.310
Astroboi says

18:30.769 --> 18:33.438
"tiff and me have a date tomorrow night.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.481
Stay away from her.

18:34.523 --> 18:37.234
If you mess with her,
I'll mess with you.

18:37.859 --> 18:40.487
So they're fighting over Tiffany online?

18:40.570 --> 18:42.197
I'm wondering if, uh...

18:42.489 --> 18:44.032
astroboi has a gun.

18:44.115 --> 18:46.576
Is there any way we could find a
real name behind that screen name?

18:46.618 --> 18:47.702
Usually, I can'T.

18:47.744 --> 18:50.497
But when Tiffany sent astroboi her pics,

18:50.539 --> 18:53.166
it opened a direct link to his computer.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.670
I got his I.P. Address right here.

18:57.671 --> 18:58.922
That's as good as a phone number.

18:59.005 --> 18:59.840
Yeah.

18:59.965 --> 19:04.511
And all I have to do is figure out
the internet account it belongs to.

19:04.594 --> 19:09.391
If I can trace the routef o
the data packets it left behind

19:09.432 --> 19:12.060
like a trail of bread crumbs...

19:12.435 --> 19:14.146
hey, astroboi wasn't too smart.

19:14.187 --> 19:17.023
He used his personal
internet account with an isp

19:17.065 --> 19:21.611
that gave us access to its customer
files for reasons just like this.

19:21.695 --> 19:22.863
Gentlemen,

19:23.405 --> 19:25.866
meet kevin weaver.

19:37.335 --> 19:39.379
I need you to get off
the bike, Mr. Weaver.

19:39.421 --> 19:41.631
What's the matter,
officer? I wasn't speeding.

19:42.716 --> 19:43.800
Turn around.

19:45.385 --> 19:48.471
Actually, you were, but
that's not why I stopped you.

19:49.681 --> 19:52.100
What's, uh... what's in the saddlebag?

19:52.350 --> 19:53.018
Nothing.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.811
Then you won't mind if
I take a look in there?

19:54.895 --> 19:55.896
Go ahead.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.111
Well,

20:04.029 --> 20:06.198
that's the second time
you've lied to me today.

20:06.239 --> 20:07.616
It's registered.

20:07.782 --> 20:09.409
It's also concealed.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.496
I just happen to have a dead
guy that was shot by a gun.

20:12.662 --> 20:14.414
You and I are gonna take a little ride.

20:14.581 --> 20:15.457
Turn around.

20:16.333 --> 20:18.251
So Mr. Weaver...

20:19.544 --> 20:22.714
you harassed Mr. Tony Massaro.

20:23.882 --> 20:24.591
Who is that?

20:24.674 --> 20:27.093
You might know him as, uh, "sexyback. "

20:27.385 --> 20:30.972
You two had it out on an internet
chat room over a girl named Tiffany.

20:31.348 --> 20:32.849
Oh. Oh, him. Yeah, I'm...

20:33.058 --> 20:35.268
I might have told him
to back off of her.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.605
So you could have her all to yourself.

20:43.360 --> 20:45.320
It was nothing like that.

20:47.614 --> 20:50.659
Did you read what he said to her?

20:52.786 --> 20:55.747
You see why I did what I did, right?

20:55.997 --> 20:57.582
Would you care to...

20:57.791 --> 20:59.835
elaborate on that?

21:02.003 --> 21:03.505
This girl he chatted with,

21:03.588 --> 21:05.924
she's pure...

21:06.591 --> 21:09.344
innocent... trusting.

21:11.179 --> 21:14.307
He asked Tiffany point
blank if she was a virgin.

21:14.432 --> 21:16.059
She said yes.

21:17.727 --> 21:19.020
I just wanted to keep it that way.

21:19.104 --> 21:20.856
Did you kill him to do that?

21:24.526 --> 21:26.027
I didn't kill anyone.

21:26.111 --> 21:27.737
I guess we'll see.

21:42.711 --> 21:43.920
- Hey, Alexx.
- Hey.

21:44.004 --> 21:45.589
Have you got any rounds for me?

21:45.630 --> 21:47.132
Working on it.

21:47.257 --> 21:50.177
Two shots to the groin.
I'd say this was personal.

21:50.218 --> 21:50.969
Yeah.

21:51.094 --> 21:54.431
Mr. Massaro here was busted on
predators among us last week.

21:54.556 --> 21:57.601
He's one of those internet pedophiles?

22:02.147 --> 22:03.231
Okay.

22:03.815 --> 22:06.109
Got another one coming.

22:09.321 --> 22:12.407
Looks like a. 243; that's
from a hunting rifle.

22:12.449 --> 22:15.952
Sounds like you may have
yourself a vigilante out there.

22:16.036 --> 22:18.413
Maybe, but it's not Kevin Weaver.

22:18.455 --> 22:21.208
The gun from his saddlebag was a. 38.

22:21.500 --> 22:23.376
I'll have to have Horatio let him go.

22:23.418 --> 22:24.628
Thank you.

22:58.286 --> 23:00.664
Natalia, we just lost a suspect.

23:00.747 --> 23:03.124
I hope you were able to find a print
on the bottle from the shooting.

23:03.208 --> 23:03.875
Yeah.

23:03.917 --> 23:07.671
I mean, it wasn't easy, but I think
I managed to Frankenstein a partial.

23:08.213 --> 23:10.465
I'm so hoping it gets us our shooter.

23:10.757 --> 23:11.967
What are you thinking?

23:12.217 --> 23:14.094
Well, the glass was
underneath the victim,

23:14.135 --> 23:17.389
so whoever broke the bottle
did it before he was shot.

23:17.556 --> 23:19.641
Which means that our mystery
man would have had time to leave

23:19.683 --> 23:22.352
and then come back and shoot Tony.

23:27.107 --> 23:28.650
T.J. Pratt.

23:28.817 --> 23:30.652
This guy did time for
buying alcohol for minors.

23:30.694 --> 23:32.195
We've got another pedophile.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.531
I'm gonna get him off the
street. Thanks, Natalia.

23:54.217 --> 23:55.802
T.J. Pratt. You're a lifeguard.

23:55.886 --> 23:57.429
Why aren't you watching the pool?

24:01.600 --> 24:03.226
No one's ever drowned on my watch.

24:03.268 --> 24:04.936
Anyone ever been shot?

24:06.188 --> 24:07.189
What, is this a joke?

24:07.230 --> 24:09.649
No, Tony Massaro was shot outside of
the eastern light cafe this morning,

24:10.358 --> 24:12.402
and you were the last person to see him.

24:13.570 --> 24:14.446
How do you know that?

24:14.696 --> 24:17.032
Your fingerprints were
on the bottle that broke.

24:17.824 --> 24:18.575
What happened?

24:18.617 --> 24:20.911
Got into a fight, threw it at him?

24:21.077 --> 24:22.871
Look, I didn't break it, he did.

24:24.789 --> 24:26.333
Yeah, we had a fight, but I was just...

24:26.374 --> 24:28.627
I was trying to get him to
come to a meeting with me.

24:31.796 --> 24:33.298
Don't lie to me, Tony,
I know why you're here.

24:33.340 --> 24:34.716
You're looking at these girls.

24:34.799 --> 24:36.092
Look, I'm on my way to a meeting now.

24:36.134 --> 24:37.928
Just get up and go with me.

24:38.261 --> 24:40.680
Leave me alone, okay?
I know what I'm doing.

24:40.722 --> 24:43.183
I'm making you go with me, come on.

24:47.395 --> 24:49.439
Was this a meeting for pedophiles?

24:49.564 --> 24:53.151
Look, we're not pedo...!
We're not pedophiles.

24:53.276 --> 24:54.361
It's a support group

24:54.402 --> 24:56.446
to help guys who look for
affection from the wrong age group.

24:56.488 --> 24:58.156
You mean children.

24:59.032 --> 25:00.951
Mind if I see your PDA?

25:10.961 --> 25:12.796
That's- it's not
what you think.

25:12.921 --> 25:14.631
Okay, why don't you
tell us what to think?

25:14.673 --> 25:16.925
You're a pedophile and you're asking
to meet with someone named gypsygirl;

25:17.008 --> 25:18.593
that sounds like a teenager to me.

25:18.635 --> 25:19.970
I wasn't on the chat.

25:20.303 --> 25:21.596
I was checking up on my guys

25:21.638 --> 25:23.890
from the support group so
they aren't trolling for girls.

25:23.932 --> 25:25.934
I'm just making sure
that they stay straight.

25:26.101 --> 25:27.936
You expect us to believe that?

25:30.355 --> 25:31.773
You know what? He may
be telling the truth.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.525
The chat's still going on.

25:33.608 --> 25:35.152
Gypsygirl is talking to someone.

25:35.193 --> 25:37.237
"C.U. Meet?

25:37.654 --> 25:39.030
Mason Park. "

25:39.072 --> 25:40.782
"Can you meet?"

25:40.824 --> 25:44.995
Whoever gypsygirl is, she just asked
someone named moonman to meet her.

25:45.036 --> 25:46.204
Do you know who these people are?

25:46.246 --> 25:47.914
No, that's not one of my guys,

25:47.956 --> 25:50.417
and I've never heard of
this gypsygirl before.

25:50.458 --> 25:52.210
Well, if she's offering the
meet, then it can't be a sting.

25:52.294 --> 25:54.129
It's got to be a real girl.

25:54.713 --> 25:56.506
Okay, you see this "d"?
It stands for "cap. "

25:56.590 --> 25:58.008
She's going to be wearing a pink cap.

25:58.091 --> 25:59.885
That's how he's going to find her.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.136
We'd better get there
before moonman does.

26:01.178 --> 26:03.221
Our real girl is in real trouble.

26:12.857 --> 26:14.442
Did we get anything?

26:14.525 --> 26:18.362
No, been out here a half an
hour, not one girl in a pink hat.

26:20.698 --> 26:22.950
Wait a minute, I might have something.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.120
This might be our girl.

26:32.502 --> 26:34.587
She's got company, too.

26:38.090 --> 26:39.175
Wait a minute, they're leaving.

26:39.217 --> 26:40.384
Hang on.

26:47.725 --> 26:49.310
That's not her.

26:53.189 --> 26:54.607
Wait a second.

26:54.774 --> 26:56.859
Let me see those glasses.

27:07.370 --> 27:09.872
Well, take a look at who that is.

27:10.665 --> 27:12.583
That's the same guy you
and Tripp talked to, huh?

27:12.625 --> 27:13.668
That's exactly who he i...

27:13.709 --> 27:14.710
he's a runner. Get him.

27:14.794 --> 27:15.962
I'm on it.

27:16.337 --> 27:18.422
He's on the move.

27:24.679 --> 27:26.722
Stop! Miami-Dade police!

27:38.317 --> 27:39.819
So, Mr. Weaver,

27:40.069 --> 27:41.028
we meet again.

27:41.070 --> 27:42.947
Lieutenant, this is not what you think.

27:42.989 --> 27:44.657
It never is.

27:44.782 --> 27:46.617
Get him up, please.

27:49.287 --> 27:51.080
Mr. Weaver, what are you doing here?

27:51.164 --> 27:54.500
I came here to warn that girl I
was talking to in the chat rooms.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.127
- Gypsygirl?
- Yeah.

27:56.169 --> 28:00.256
She's new to the rooms, and she
is already in way over her head.

28:00.298 --> 28:02.341
You expect us to believe you?

28:04.760 --> 28:06.429
Look in my backpack.

28:14.979 --> 28:16.856
That's my daughter, Cassie.

28:18.691 --> 28:21.486
I got her a laptop
for her 13th birthday.

28:24.197 --> 28:27.450
I was so stupid, thinking she'd
just use it for her homework.

28:27.950 --> 28:29.744
She started using the chat rooms.

28:29.785 --> 28:32.497
Yeah, her mother and I
were too busy to notice.

28:33.247 --> 28:34.957
I guess she met a boy.

28:35.791 --> 28:39.045
Or, uh, someone pretending to be one.

28:39.545 --> 28:42.340
A 35-year-old man
killed our angel.

28:42.882 --> 28:43.883
Detective.

28:46.677 --> 28:48.262
Mr. Weaver,

28:48.679 --> 28:52.892
are you killing the men that are
preying on girls like your daughter?

28:56.229 --> 28:58.648
Are you a parent, Lieutenant?

28:59.106 --> 29:01.275
I don't kill anyone.

29:01.984 --> 29:04.320
I don't care about those guys.

29:04.987 --> 29:08.741
I want to protect these girls from
making the same mistake that Cassie did.

29:08.783 --> 29:10.076
I show them Cassie's binder,

29:10.159 --> 29:13.287
and I hope to scare them
out of this chat room.

29:22.922 --> 29:24.465
You never found the girl?

29:24.507 --> 29:26.133
No, I think we scared her off,

29:26.259 --> 29:28.845
but patrol did find her pink hat
on the other side of the park,

29:28.928 --> 29:31.305
and Natalia is processing it now.

29:31.556 --> 29:32.598
Is this the
hit-and-run car?

29:32.640 --> 29:34.517
I thought Calleigh
hit pay dirt with this.

29:34.559 --> 29:36.394
Yeah, she found the fingernail jewel,

29:36.435 --> 29:40.439
but we can't prove that it belonged
to Sean Radley's daughter, Hannah.

29:48.531 --> 29:49.782
What's that right there?

29:49.866 --> 29:51.242
What's what? I don't see anything.

29:51.284 --> 29:53.494
Right there, shine the UV light on it.

29:59.041 --> 30:00.251
It's a contact lens.

30:00.293 --> 30:02.211
Yeah, well, what's it doing there?

30:02.587 --> 30:03.963
My guess: Trauma.

30:04.005 --> 30:07.466
Driver hit Sean Radley,
contact lens popped out.

30:17.894 --> 30:19.270
It's not good.

30:19.312 --> 30:20.229
What's not good?

30:20.313 --> 30:22.148
Contact lens is tinted.

30:22.523 --> 30:24.692
I arrested a pedophile once,

30:24.817 --> 30:26.319
purple contacts.

30:26.527 --> 30:27.820
Why, 'cause kids like color?

30:27.945 --> 30:30.031
So no kid can identify them.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.077
Okay, so we got a car
that's driven by a pedophile

30:35.119 --> 30:37.788
that hit our lawyer
pedophile, Sean Radley.

30:38.039 --> 30:42.084
Yeah. He stole his wife's
car to throw us off maybe.

30:42.168 --> 30:44.962
All right, I guess all
we got to do is, uh...

30:45.087 --> 30:46.506
find the other contact.

30:57.350 --> 31:00.186
<i>- moonman: i bet you're really pretty too
- gypsygirl: u want 2 c?</i>

31:15.243 --> 31:16.702
I wish I had better news.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.413
You weren't able to get a DNA
profile off gypsygirl's headband?

31:19.455 --> 31:21.833
No, I was able to get
a profile, I just...

31:21.874 --> 31:23.334
couldn't get a match in CODIS.

31:23.417 --> 31:26.254
Did you try the child
abduction databases?

31:26.379 --> 31:28.589
No, thank you, that's a good idea.

31:31.551 --> 31:32.426
You know, when I worked for the feds,

31:32.468 --> 31:36.430
I used to load samples into the
National Child Identification Program.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.558
Yeah, but that's voluntary.

31:38.599 --> 31:39.934
Yeah, but you know
it's only going to work

31:39.976 --> 31:41.936
if her parents provided
her DNA and prints.

31:42.019 --> 31:43.980
Well, it's worth a shot.

31:48.526 --> 31:50.528
You're not going to
believe who the match is.

31:50.653 --> 31:51.904
Are you sure?

31:56.534 --> 31:57.410
Hannah.

31:57.535 --> 31:58.828
Where's your mother?

31:59.203 --> 32:01.205
She's with my little
brother at the funeral home.

32:01.289 --> 32:02.915
So you're, um...

32:03.541 --> 32:05.459
you're gypsygirl online, aren't you?

32:05.543 --> 32:06.669
Yeah, so?

32:06.711 --> 32:11.007
Hannah, you were at the park to
confront moonman. Weren't you?

32:12.133 --> 32:15.219
Yeah, I mean, I was going to kick
him in the crotch or something,

32:15.261 --> 32:17.221
scratch his eyes out, I don't know,

32:17.263 --> 32:19.599
but the cops showed
up and scared him off.

32:19.640 --> 32:22.059
So you arrange to meet men all the time?

32:22.101 --> 32:23.436
Look, I set up gypsygirl

32:23.519 --> 32:26.481
so I could meet these jerks and get
them to stop hurting these girls.

32:26.522 --> 32:28.441
Just like your dad was.

32:28.566 --> 32:29.650
Right?

32:30.151 --> 32:33.488
You knew that your dad was caught
on that Predator tv show, right?

32:35.615 --> 32:39.452
I had never even heard of it until
I went to school the next day.

32:40.328 --> 32:42.788
Everyone made sure I saw it.

32:43.206 --> 32:46.042
All of a sudden, no one was allowed to
come over to my house, even be near me.

32:48.628 --> 32:49.837
Your, uh...

32:50.838 --> 32:52.215
your dad was your hero?

32:52.340 --> 32:53.216
H.

32:54.258 --> 32:58.137
My dad taught me to always
look out for the helpless.

32:58.221 --> 33:00.348
But he was lying, wasn't he?

33:07.355 --> 33:09.023
Hey, those are my contacts.

33:09.857 --> 33:11.025
It's contact.

33:11.734 --> 33:12.860
You're, uh... you're missing one.

33:12.902 --> 33:16.197
It's the same color as the contact
we found in the rental car that

33:16.531 --> 33:18.115
ran over your father.

33:20.368 --> 33:21.327
Hannah,

33:21.494 --> 33:23.788
you killed your dad, didn't you?

33:30.837 --> 33:32.755
Tell me what happened.

33:38.427 --> 33:40.513
I stole my mom's keys,

33:41.347 --> 33:42.682
I took the car...

33:44.934 --> 33:47.186
and I waited for him where he parks.

34:02.118 --> 34:04.620
Hannah, you're going to
be placed under arrest now.

34:04.704 --> 34:07.081
I didn't want him to hurt
anyone else, like Mallary.

34:07.123 --> 34:08.331
Like who?

34:09.208 --> 34:10.333
This girl online.

34:10.376 --> 34:14.005
I tried to scare her away from this
guy, but she gave him her address.

34:14.045 --> 34:15.797
Do you have the address?

34:16.090 --> 34:17.925
It's on my computer.

34:24.599 --> 34:26.766
H, the predator's on his way there now.

34:30.813 --> 34:33.649
Open up, let me in.

34:35.525 --> 34:39.864
Mallary, my name is Lieutenant Caine,
would you open the door, please.

34:42.574 --> 34:43.784
Can I help you?

34:44.076 --> 34:45.995
Mallary, my name is Lieutenant Caine.

34:46.036 --> 34:47.955
Can I talk to you for a minute?

34:48.748 --> 34:49.790
Do I have a choice?

34:49.831 --> 34:50.875
No, ma'am.

34:56.339 --> 34:58.132
Where are your parents, Mallary?

34:58.466 --> 35:00.635
Palm beach, looking at
some property or something.

35:00.676 --> 35:02.345
So you're here alone?

35:02.929 --> 35:03.763
Yeah.

35:04.096 --> 35:05.181
That's what they always do.

35:05.223 --> 35:08.017
I'm, like, 14. I can
take care of myself.

35:08.768 --> 35:12.063
Mallary, you're expecting a
male visitor here, aren't you?

35:12.647 --> 35:14.065
Yeah. So?

35:14.106 --> 35:15.399
This is my house. I'm safe here.

35:15.441 --> 35:17.735
You're not safe here, Mallary.

35:17.902 --> 35:20.029
The man is a pedophile.

35:22.365 --> 35:24.283
Come on, you're not my dad.

35:24.575 --> 35:25.785
These guys are harmless.

35:25.827 --> 35:27.578
They just buy me things. That's it.

35:27.620 --> 35:30.081
- I mean, it's no big deal.
- Mallary, what is his name?

35:32.959 --> 35:34.585
He said his name is Zane.

35:34.627 --> 35:35.294
Okay.

35:35.670 --> 35:36.671
Mallary,

35:37.255 --> 35:38.714
I need your help.

36:11.624 --> 36:13.209
Just a minute.

36:13.959 --> 36:16.587
Mallary, you're going to be okay.

36:17.046 --> 36:18.673
I'll be right here.

36:22.259 --> 36:23.511
Natalia,

36:23.969 --> 36:26.097
dispatch just got a call from the cafe?

36:26.180 --> 36:28.766
Turns out your evidence
thief is sitting at the bar.

36:28.849 --> 36:30.601
That's great. Let's call
Tripp and bring him in.

36:30.685 --> 36:31.644
Will do.

36:34.397 --> 36:36.983
So, Jared, you stole
evidence from a crime scene.

36:37.692 --> 36:39.318
Well, that's why you
were there, though, right?

36:39.360 --> 36:41.696
To remove anything that
would lead us to the shooter.

36:44.031 --> 36:46.158
Look, I just saw something
fall from the roof.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.369
Thought I'd grab it
before you guys showed up.

36:56.377 --> 36:57.712
Did you see that?

37:04.885 --> 37:06.345
I got it right here.

37:07.805 --> 37:09.724
It was still hot when I picked it up.

37:12.768 --> 37:15.354
It's the same caliber
as our murder rounds.

37:16.647 --> 37:18.274
I didn't mess with it, okay?

37:18.316 --> 37:20.318
Well, then why steal this bullet casing?

37:20.568 --> 37:22.069
Because it's cool.

37:22.278 --> 37:25.156
Something from a murder. I
throw it on ebay and make a mint.

37:25.197 --> 37:27.325
Look, I don't know who the shooter is,

37:27.533 --> 37:28.451
so can I go?

37:28.492 --> 37:29.744
No, you can't.

37:30.661 --> 37:33.372
You stole evidence in
a murder investigation,

37:33.414 --> 37:36.167
and you're going to need that shooter
to prove that you're telling the truth.

38:15.498 --> 38:16.290
This is weird.

38:16.332 --> 38:17.416
Take a look at this.

38:17.458 --> 38:20.836
There's only one print on this
casing, and it came back like this.

38:20.920 --> 38:22.421
Sean Radley? That's
our hit-and-run victim.

38:22.463 --> 38:24.048
That's the, uh...

38:24.090 --> 38:25.424
the guy that got run
over by his daughter.

38:25.508 --> 38:28.219
Yeah, well, how could a
dead man shoot Tony Massaro?

38:44.402 --> 38:47.321
Mrs. Radley, we found that
hunting rifle in your garage.

38:47.488 --> 38:50.032
Yes. It was my husband's.

38:50.116 --> 38:53.202
He liked to keep it loaded,
so I made him store it there.

38:53.327 --> 38:56.080
That rifle was used
to kill Tony Massaro.

38:58.124 --> 39:00.835
Now, you did a good job
cleaning up after yourself,

39:01.043 --> 39:03.838
but you forgot to clean the
bullets before you fired them.

39:03.879 --> 39:05.798
I don't have to sit here
and listen to your stories,

39:05.881 --> 39:07.550
so, I'm-I'm going to go.

39:07.675 --> 39:09.093
Well, if you didn't do it, Mrs. Radley,

39:09.135 --> 39:11.053
that only leaves your daughter,

39:11.262 --> 39:14.181
and we already know what
she's capable of doing already.

39:18.811 --> 39:22.982
Sean used to make me go hunting
with him, even though I hated it.

39:23.190 --> 39:24.692
I guess that I should thank him, though,

39:24.734 --> 39:27.153
because he made me a really good shot.

39:40.249 --> 39:42.585
So you created the vigilante.

39:43.753 --> 39:45.129
I just thought it could get you to look

39:45.171 --> 39:47.214
at someone other than my
daughter for Sean's murder.

39:47.256 --> 39:49.175
But it didn't work, did it?

39:50.760 --> 39:52.345
I'm not sorry.

39:52.386 --> 39:55.348
A good mother will do
anything to protect her child.

39:56.349 --> 39:59.435
Hannah shouldn't have
to pay for his mistakes.

40:00.019 --> 40:00.978
You're right.

40:04.315 --> 40:06.734
But I'm afraid, you're going
to have to pay for yours.

40:14.950 --> 40:16.410
Mallary, it's me.

40:16.577 --> 40:17.787
Come on. Open up.

40:20.373 --> 40:21.374
Hey.

40:21.415 --> 40:22.625
I told you I'd bring 'em.

40:22.667 --> 40:23.542
Great.

40:23.584 --> 40:24.877
Come on in?

40:46.983 --> 40:48.484
So, Mr. Durning,

40:48.526 --> 40:51.946
You're calling yourself Zane these days.

40:55.658 --> 40:57.410
What are you doing here?

40:59.453 --> 41:02.206
I saw some activity in the chat room.

41:02.331 --> 41:03.916
Thought I'd come out here and
make sure Mallary was all right.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.043
By bringing her alcohol?

41:09.296 --> 41:11.090
Come off it, Lieutenant.

41:11.132 --> 41:12.675
These girls are a lot
older than their age.

41:12.717 --> 41:15.219
She is 14 years old.

41:15.302 --> 41:18.556
Yeah, but I spend all day
online with these girls.

41:18.639 --> 41:21.892
I see what they write, how bad
they want to be with someone.

41:21.976 --> 41:23.686
Mr. Durning...

41:23.769 --> 41:25.146
this girl... she wanted me.

41:25.187 --> 41:26.480
Mr. Durning,...

41:26.564 --> 41:27.648
you are...

41:27.732 --> 41:29.483
supposed to be...

41:29.567 --> 41:31.777
protecting these girls.

41:38.743 --> 41:39.827
Mallary?

41:41.746 --> 41:43.414
Please wait outside.

41:48.169 --> 41:50.087
You know, Mr. Durning,

41:50.546 --> 41:53.257
you really picked the
wrong week for this.

41:53.591 --> 41:55.801
I- I didn't do anything.

41:58.971 --> 42:00.681
Mr. Durning...

42:03.142 --> 42:04.769
you are...

42:06.228 --> 42:07.730
resisting arrest.

42:07.813 --> 42:09.273
No. No, I'm not.

42:09.315 --> 42:10.733
I'm not resisting arrest.

42:10.816 --> 42:12.526
Not yet.

42:13.027 --> 42:14.779
Let's see...

42:15.988 --> 42:18.574
how long that lasts.
