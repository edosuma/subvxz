02:19.625 --> 02:20.667
I love you.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.208
I love you, Charlie.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.125
I love you.

03:14.251 --> 03:15.458
Are you scared?

03:18.251 --> 03:19.500
I'm scared, too.

03:35.334 --> 03:39.293
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie,
I love you, Charlie.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.500
Charlie, I love you.

03:44.209 --> 03:45.750
I love you, Charlie.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.583
Charlie girl, that
shoot was insane,

04:25.625 --> 04:27.750
but I'm finally on a flight.

04:27.792 --> 04:31.375
I'm gonna need a drink
when I get home, or 17.

04:32.417 --> 04:34.251
Oh shit, we're taking off.

04:34.293 --> 04:36.458
Happy anniversary, baby.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.791
I love you.

04:37.833 --> 04:39.293
See you tonight.

06:30.625 --> 06:32.833
Oh!

06:32.875 --> 06:33.750
God.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.417
Simone?

07:47.667 --> 07:48.500
Babe?

09:02.750 --> 09:03.917
Hey Barker.

09:03.959 --> 09:05.750
Your mom will be home soon.

09:16.583 --> 09:17.876
Oh.

09:17.918 --> 09:20.834
Hey, it's Simone
and you are apparently

09:20.876 --> 09:22.625
someone who still
leaves voicemails.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.042
Kind of weird.

09:24.083 --> 09:25.876
No one does that anymore.

09:25.918 --> 09:28.083
How retro.

09:28.125 --> 09:29.792
Hey, it's me.

09:29.834 --> 09:32.208
I can't wait till you
get home. Can you tell?

09:33.458 --> 09:37.083
Sorry, I just, uh, want to
make sure you're on your way.

09:37.125 --> 09:38.208
I thought I heard you come in

09:38.250 --> 09:42.166
and I got really
excited, but, anyway,

09:42.208 --> 09:45.666
I tracked your flight and
it said you got in on time,

09:45.708 --> 09:48.125
so I hope Philly was
good, and the shoot.

09:49.918 --> 09:51.959
Maybe I can be on the next one.

09:52.001 --> 09:54.541
You know, I've been
working on my airbrushing

09:54.583 --> 09:56.583
while you've been
gone, so anyway...

09:59.793 --> 10:00.959
Happy anniversary, babe.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.167
I'll see you soon. Okay, bye.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.083
Oh, god.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.125
Barker! God.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.793
Uh Simone, could you...

10:38.793 --> 10:39.666
Oh.

10:41.708 --> 10:42.959
For the photo shoot.

10:44.125 --> 10:46.083
I mean, come on,
right? It's good.

10:46.125 --> 10:47.250
It's really good.

10:47.292 --> 10:48.917
Oh, look, it's so fucked up.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.000
Can you imagine being
done here at dark?

10:51.042 --> 10:52.666
It's gonna scare
the shit out of me.

10:52.708 --> 10:56.042
I can't wait, I'm so stoked.

11:14.667 --> 11:15.542
Girl.

11:16.500 --> 11:20.125
Get to the bar and make
bad decisions with me.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.876
Right meow.

11:21.918 --> 11:24.000
Right now, do it now.

11:24.042 --> 11:25.542
Right now, okay?

11:27.083 --> 11:27.917
You know what? Fuck this.

11:27.958 --> 11:29.250
I'm calling you.

11:37.375 --> 11:39.625
- Hello?
- Uh, hello.

11:39.667 --> 11:40.792
Yo!

11:40.834 --> 11:42.876
The Trap. First round's on me.

11:42.918 --> 11:45.208
Get yo shit, girl.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.667
Are you sure it's
the first round?

11:46.709 --> 11:48.333
Whatever,
your first round.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.333
Don't fucking judge me.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.250
I would never.

11:52.709 --> 11:54.709
- But I can't tonight.
- Why?

11:54.751 --> 11:56.751
I'm waiting for
Simone. Tonight's our-

11:56.793 --> 11:59.041
- Oh, god!

11:59.083 --> 12:01.041
Why am I not surprised?

12:01.083 --> 12:02.208
Oh, yeah. That's right.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.000
It's because you wait on her

12:04.042 --> 12:06.916
like it's your full
time fucking job.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.125
It's all you do
these days, dude.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.208
Come on. You used to be fun.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.375
Remember? Fun.

12:14.417 --> 12:15.292
Hm.

12:17.876 --> 12:18.751
Hello?

12:19.958 --> 12:21.416
Yeah, I'm still here.

12:21.458 --> 12:23.083
Oh.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.208
I'm sorry.

12:25.375 --> 12:29.375
I didn't mean to hurt your
feelings, but like low key,

12:29.417 --> 12:31.041
you know that I'm fucking right.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.916
Like, all you do is like cry

12:32.958 --> 12:34.166
and complain about that bitch.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.709
Don't call her that.

12:35.751 --> 12:39.166
I can call her
whatever the fuck I want.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.375
I've known her longer.

12:40.417 --> 12:42.000
Remember?

12:42.042 --> 12:44.792
Thea, it's our
anniversary tonight, okay?

12:44.834 --> 12:47.375
Which you would know if
you ever listened to me.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.041
- Hey, I-
- And I don't wanna

12:49.083 --> 12:51.458
hear anything negative
about the woman I love.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.125
I don't think that's
too much to ask, do you?

12:53.167 --> 12:55.041
Oh, okay. All right.

12:55.083 --> 12:59.083
So where is the woman that
you love right now, huh?

12:59.125 --> 13:00.916
She is on her way home.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.375
There was a shoot
she couldn't pass up

13:02.417 --> 13:05.416
and it was a great
opportunity so she did it

13:05.458 --> 13:06.626
and she's on her
way home right now.

13:06.668 --> 13:10.000
Yeah, see, that's exactly
what I'm fucking talking about.

13:10.042 --> 13:11.333
She's never home.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.208
She's always somewhere else.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.416
You're always alone.

13:15.458 --> 13:18.125
And wait, why didn't she ask you

13:18.167 --> 13:19.375
to come with her on this shoot?

13:19.417 --> 13:21.751
If it's such a good
fucking opportunity,

13:21.793 --> 13:24.291
why is she hiring some
fucking hack makeup artist

13:24.333 --> 13:27.875
- out of fucking Pittsburgh?
- Philly.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.458
Whatever. It's all gross.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.166
Listen, I know that I introduced
you two, and quite frankly,

13:34.208 --> 13:38.083
I kick myself for that on
like a regular fucking basis.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.792
Thea, cut it out.

13:39.833 --> 13:43.000
I, dude, like,
I'm glad you're having fun.

13:43.042 --> 13:44.166
Oh my
god, mom, really?

13:44.208 --> 13:46.041
You're becoming
a little butterfly

13:46.083 --> 13:47.500
and spreading your wings.

13:47.542 --> 13:50.208
I just wish that you hadn't
moved in with that bitch.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.792
Am I not being clear?

13:51.833 --> 13:54.041
I don't want to hear this.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.709
I'm just saying.
Watch your back, girl.

13:56.751 --> 14:00.041
I know the shit that she
fucking puts people through.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.000
Yeah, fucking Simone.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.375
Her reputation precedes her.

14:03.417 --> 14:05.041
I don't even have
to say her name

14:05.083 --> 14:07.166
and people already know who
I'm talking about, yeah.

14:07.208 --> 14:08.833
You know who I'm talking about.

14:08.875 --> 14:12.083
Davey, you definitely know
who I'm fucking talking about.

14:12.125 --> 14:13.958
She's sadistic.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.875
Yeah, I know.

14:14.917 --> 14:17.375
You have told me like
20 goddamn times.

14:17.417 --> 14:18.250
Okay.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.125
Sorry.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.791
Truce.

14:22.833 --> 14:25.291
I'm not trying to hurt your
fucking feelings, I just,

14:25.333 --> 14:26.291
I have your back.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.458
I'm always gonna have your back.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.208
And I don't really think
telling you the fucking truth

14:30.250 --> 14:31.501
and telling you
to open your eyes

14:31.543 --> 14:34.208
- makes me a bad friend.
- Simone and I are fine.

14:34.250 --> 14:37.083
She's on her way home
right now and now my...

14:39.250 --> 14:41.208
Charlie don't do this.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.166
Don't get all pissed
off and hang up.

14:43.208 --> 14:44.958
Come on. Don't be lame.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.083
Look, I will talk
to you tomorrow, okay?

14:47.125 --> 14:49.208
Have fun.

14:49.250 --> 14:50.125
Fine, bitch.

14:51.083 --> 14:51.917
Bye.

14:53.375 --> 14:54.250
Bye.

15:07.958 --> 15:08.792
Shit.

15:43.000 --> 15:43.875
Hi mom.

15:44.668 --> 15:45.833
Oh.

15:45.875 --> 15:46.501
Mom.

15:46.543 --> 15:47.833
I can't hear...

15:49.875 --> 15:50.958
Yeah, I ca...

15:51.000 --> 15:52.291
I can't hear you.

15:52.333 --> 15:54.833
Yeah, mom, just
click, click on the...

15:57.626 --> 15:59.291
Oh my god.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.208
Yeah, mom.

16:01.375 --> 16:02.916
Down.

16:02.958 --> 16:04.459
Uh huh.

16:04.501 --> 16:06.584
- And to the le-
- That's it.

16:06.626 --> 16:07.833
Can you hear me now?

16:07.875 --> 16:09.292
Yes, I can hear you.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.125
Hi Char.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.459
Hi.

16:12.501 --> 16:14.584
I never used
this thing, but um,

16:16.083 --> 16:17.958
I thought it would be
nice to see one another.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.042
It's been so long.

16:20.042 --> 16:21.333
Yeah. Hi.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.958
So how is everything?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.375
Must be so many
distractions up there.

16:26.543 --> 16:29.250
Are you still doing your
little makeup projects?

16:30.626 --> 16:31.543
Uh, yep.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.041
I'm working as a
professional makeup artist

16:36.083 --> 16:38.083
and things are going
really well, actually.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.166
Oh Charlene, I didn't mean
anything by that, really.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.166
- No, it's fine.
- I mean...

16:41.208 --> 16:42.625
No, no, no, no, no. No.

16:42.667 --> 16:44.291
You were always so good at that

16:44.333 --> 16:48.542
and I'm glad that people are
appreciating what you can do.

16:48.584 --> 16:50.250
And you're doing what you love.

16:52.208 --> 16:53.584
Well, thank you.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.376
I remember when
you were little,

16:55.418 --> 16:59.000
you used to put
makeup on every doll

16:59.042 --> 17:01.000
and stuffed animal
that we ever gave you.

17:01.042 --> 17:02.542
Do you remember that?

17:02.584 --> 17:05.040
I'd come into your room
and there'd be magic marker

17:05.083 --> 17:08.459
all over them and
blue eyeshadow and,

17:08.501 --> 17:11.665
and rosy red cheeks
and red lipstick.

17:11.708 --> 17:14.541
You had the fanciest
dolls in town.

17:14.584 --> 17:15.958
Yeah, I guess I did.

17:17.584 --> 17:19.541
I totally forgot about
that until right now.

17:19.584 --> 17:20.459
Yeah.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.208
I...

17:25.250 --> 17:26.376
It's good to see you.

17:26.417 --> 17:28.291
It's good to see
you, too, Charlene.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.376
I like that lipstick
color you're wearing.

17:31.418 --> 17:32.292
What's that?

17:33.958 --> 17:34.916
Oh no.

17:34.958 --> 17:38.125
I'm drinking red wine.
They're just stained.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.666
Oh.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.958
Oh, well what you
look very pretty.

17:45.625 --> 17:46.958
Um hey mom,

17:47.000 --> 17:48.292
I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

17:48.334 --> 17:51.250
You said there was an emergency?

17:51.292 --> 17:52.666
Everything's fine.

17:52.708 --> 17:56.750
I just wanted to see you
face-to-face because, um,

17:56.792 --> 17:59.292
because your memaw passed
away last night and-

17:59.334 --> 18:00.501
- Oh, god.
- Just thought

18:00.543 --> 18:02.583
- I should tell you so.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, mom.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.459
Yeah. It's okay.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.583
It was her time, you know?

18:06.625 --> 18:09.208
She was ready to go
back to the Lord.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.417
I'm glad she's not hurting
anymore, really, just,

18:12.459 --> 18:14.583
you know, it was kind
of bad at the end.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.958
God, I wish I could
have talked to her.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.376
Yeah.

18:19.418 --> 18:22.750
I mean, we could have called
you I guess, but Charlene,

18:22.792 --> 18:25.000
I just want you to know
she loved you very much.

18:25.042 --> 18:26.000
- She did.
- Oh.

18:27.250 --> 18:29.541
Well, when, when's the funeral?

18:29.583 --> 18:31.083
We're just gonna
have a small thing

18:31.125 --> 18:33.041
so it's really nothing
to fly back for.

18:33.083 --> 18:33.791
Don't worry about it.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.208
No.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.417
No I, I mean, I, I
want to be there.

18:37.459 --> 18:38.625
No, no, no, it's okay.

18:38.667 --> 18:39.583
You don't have to.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.625
I did want to ask you, um,

18:42.667 --> 18:45.251
can you send back that
necklace that she gave you?

18:46.376 --> 18:48.083
I'd like to have
her buried with it.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.708
It was her favorite.

18:49.750 --> 18:51.791
Um, what necklace?

18:51.833 --> 18:53.500
It was the cross, remember?

18:54.459 --> 18:56.292
The gold cross she gave you.

18:56.334 --> 18:58.083
You took it with
you when you moved.

18:58.125 --> 19:02.791
Yeah, um, yeah, I, I
think I have it somewhere.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.791
You think? You didn't
lose it, did you?

19:04.833 --> 19:06.166
No, no, no.

19:06.208 --> 19:07.376
I'm sure it's in my...

19:07.418 --> 19:09.209
Look, I will be able
to find it, okay?

19:09.251 --> 19:11.166
Well, can you go
and look for it?

19:11.208 --> 19:12.666
I'm kind of in the
middle of something, mom.

19:12.708 --> 19:14.292
What do you mean you're
in the middle of something?

19:14.334 --> 19:17.251
I called you and you're
just, you're drinking wine

19:17.293 --> 19:18.750
in that cave of yours.

19:18.792 --> 19:20.666
You can't be that
busy, Charlene.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.251
Come on.

19:22.293 --> 19:23.417
Jesus Christ.

19:23.459 --> 19:25.166
Please don't take the
Lord's name in vain.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.458
Mom, it's not a cave, okay?

19:27.500 --> 19:28.708
I live in a pretty nice
apartment, actually.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.292
Yeah, and I've never seen it
really, so, how would I know?

19:32.334 --> 19:33.708
When you showed
me pictures of it,

19:33.750 --> 19:36.417
it had all those Satanist
things all over the walls.

19:36.458 --> 19:37.625
Satan...

19:37.667 --> 19:39.376
We don't have Satanist
stuff on the walls, mom.

19:39.418 --> 19:41.376
They're antiques. Some
of them are crosses.

19:41.418 --> 19:42.750
Antiques?

19:42.792 --> 19:44.167
Yeah, okay.

19:44.209 --> 19:45.666
Well who put those
in your apartment?

19:45.708 --> 19:49.125
Was that you or was that
your, your roommate?

19:49.167 --> 19:50.334
What's her name? Simone?

19:51.583 --> 19:52.458
Yes.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.167
My roommate's name is Simone,

19:55.209 --> 19:57.417
and she's not a Satanist, mom.

19:57.458 --> 19:59.125
- That's not even-
- Is that you?

19:59.167 --> 20:00.833
On the wall there?

20:00.875 --> 20:02.167
- Who took that?
- No.

20:02.209 --> 20:04.167
- Mom, no, that's not-
- Who took that?

20:04.209 --> 20:08.167
I...

20:08.209 --> 20:09.625
Simone did.

20:09.667 --> 20:10.708
Okay?

20:10.750 --> 20:13.292
Mom, she's a
photographer. It's art.

20:13.334 --> 20:14.500
Okay? It's not-

20:14.542 --> 20:16.416
- Can you just please
go find my necklace?

20:16.458 --> 20:18.251
Just please. I really need it.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.293
Do you ever even
think about me?

20:24.583 --> 20:26.750
How I'm doing or
think to call me

20:26.792 --> 20:28.251
when you don't need something?

20:28.293 --> 20:30.750
Your grandmother just died.

20:30.792 --> 20:33.334
My mother is dead.

20:33.376 --> 20:36.209
All I'm asking you
for is to go and look

20:36.251 --> 20:38.209
for the necklace that she
shouldn't have given you

20:38.251 --> 20:39.750
in the first place
and send it to me

20:39.792 --> 20:41.292
so I can bury her with it.

20:41.334 --> 20:43.125
What is the problem?

20:45.792 --> 20:47.376
I will look when I have time.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.293
- Anything else?
- You know something?

20:55.792 --> 20:58.375
I'm just glad that she
can't see you right now

20:58.417 --> 21:00.209
and what you turned into.

21:00.251 --> 21:02.875
I haven't turned
into anything, mom.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.750
You just never figured
out how to accept that I-

21:04.792 --> 21:06.334
- I don't have anything
more to say to you.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.416
Great.

21:07.458 --> 21:08.251
- Great seeing you.
- So just go find my necklace.

21:08.293 --> 21:08.875
Okay.

21:08.917 --> 21:09.791
I will talk...

21:09.833 --> 21:10.875
Wait, mom.

21:10.917 --> 21:11.791
Hold on.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.375
What time is it there?

21:13.417 --> 21:15.583
What do you mean? It's
the same time as you?

21:15.625 --> 21:18.375
Is it, is it daytime still?

21:18.417 --> 21:19.791
Are you trunk?

21:19.833 --> 21:22.750
It is 2:15 in the
afternoon on Friday

21:22.792 --> 21:24.251
and you're drunk and alone.

21:24.293 --> 21:26.458
What has happened
to you, Charlene?

21:26.500 --> 21:27.791
Where's the time?

21:27.833 --> 21:29.416
You know what? Nevermind mom.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.666
- Thank you so much for-
- Just go find my...

21:30.708 --> 21:32.167
- Would you please?
- Okay.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.375
Thank you so much
for the phone call.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.791
- I will find your necklace-
- Oh my-

21:34.833 --> 21:36.167
- And send it to you

21:36.209 --> 21:37.251
and then you never have
to talk to me again.

21:37.293 --> 21:38.375
- Oh my goodness.
- Okay?

21:38.417 --> 21:39.541
Thanks for the invite
to the funeral.

21:39.583 --> 21:40.791
I will never
talk to you again.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.458
- I just want my necklace.
- Bye, mom, yeah, great.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.209
Oh, god.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.291
Oh, god. Hello?

22:14.333 --> 22:16.958
Is anyone in the hall?
Our door is stuck again.

22:18.792 --> 22:19.667
Hello?

22:25.708 --> 22:26.916
God, god.

22:26.958 --> 22:31.666
Fucking...

22:31.708 --> 22:32.375
Really?

22:41.043 --> 22:43.333
Where's the fucking time?

23:30.458 --> 23:34.417
What the fuck?

23:52.667 --> 23:54.416
You're not here.

23:54.458 --> 23:55.750
You're never here.

23:55.792 --> 23:58.416
Why are you never here?

23:58.458 --> 24:00.791
Where are you, Charlie?

24:00.833 --> 24:01.708
Charlie.

24:02.708 --> 24:03.583
Charlie!

24:05.375 --> 24:07.583
Girl, put some
motherfucking pants on

24:07.625 --> 24:11.416
and get to the bar, now,
right now, right now.

24:11.458 --> 24:12.333
Love you.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.001
You enjoying this?

24:31.167 --> 24:32.667
We have got to move.

24:39.043 --> 24:40.500
Hey, Vito.

24:40.542 --> 24:43.126
It's Charlie Crane
from apartment 1-R.

24:43.167 --> 24:46.166
Listen, our front
door is stuck again.

24:46.208 --> 24:49.126
I can't seem to open
it from the inside

24:49.167 --> 24:50.833
and I think someone
covered all the windows

24:50.875 --> 24:53.458
with some kind of tarp.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.043
Is there work being done on
the building or something?

24:57.167 --> 24:59.917
Please call me as
soon as you get this,

24:59.959 --> 25:00.959
I'd really appreciate it.

25:01.001 --> 25:01.834
Okay.

25:01.876 --> 25:02.917
Thank you.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.833
Bye.

25:05.417 --> 25:06.084
Ugh.

25:14.625 --> 25:15.500
Simone?

25:28.833 --> 25:29.708
Simone?

27:03.042 --> 27:03.959
Oh.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.876
Jesus.

28:57.208 --> 28:58.083
Please pick up.

28:59.417 --> 29:00.333
Pick up, pick up-

29:00.375 --> 29:01.541
- Hey, it's Simone

29:01.583 --> 29:04.625
and you are apparently someone
who still uses voicemails.

29:05.751 --> 29:08.000
Kinda weird. No one
does that anymore.

29:08.042 --> 29:10.166
How retro.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.875
Hey, it's me again.

29:11.917 --> 29:16.917
Um, I'm sorry to call so much,
but are you here?

29:18.042 --> 29:19.834
Um, I heard someone like
walking around in here

29:19.875 --> 29:21.375
and I think our
bedroom door is real-

29:22.751 --> 29:23.792
Oh, call me when
you got this, okay?

29:23.834 --> 29:24.709
Love you. Bye.

29:27.167 --> 29:28.667
Hey, hello?

29:28.709 --> 29:30.125
Can you hear me? Please, please.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.916
My door is stuck and
I'm locked in my apar...

29:32.958 --> 29:35.125
Hello?

30:14.500 --> 30:15.333
Hello?

30:18.208 --> 30:21.875
Hey, can you hear me?

30:23.042 --> 30:24.500
I think we live next
door to each other.

30:24.542 --> 30:28.291
I'm so sorry, but my
front door is stuck.

30:28.333 --> 30:30.375
Would you be able
to help me open it?

30:34.292 --> 30:37.917
Ma'am, hello?

30:41.875 --> 30:42.751
All right.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.208
That woman next door
is crying again.

30:53.250 --> 30:56.375
Oh, the girl is
always crying about something.

30:56.417 --> 30:57.250
- Yeah, geez.
- No wonder he's

30:57.292 --> 30:57.917
gone all the time.

31:00.417 --> 31:02.041
Oh shit, I forgot to tell you,

31:02.083 --> 31:04.083
the Latz Gallery is showing
some of my work next month.

31:04.125 --> 31:06.875
You're going to be hanging
on some walls in the Village.

31:06.917 --> 31:08.333
How fucking dope is that?

31:08.375 --> 31:10.208
Oh my god, that's great.

31:10.250 --> 31:11.833
What?

31:12.543 --> 31:13.916
I said that's great.

31:13.958 --> 31:14.791
Which ones?

31:14.833 --> 31:15.833
Some nudes.

31:15.875 --> 31:16.958
You're cool with that, right?

31:17.000 --> 31:18.083
I mean, it's an
incredible gallery.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.125
Whatever you want, babe.

31:19.167 --> 31:21.292
- I'm so happy for you.
- Right?

31:22.833 --> 31:25.375
Hoping someone rich wants
to buy you, you know?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.750
Then I'll try to sell
them a picture, too.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.208
I'm kidding, duh.

31:34.833 --> 31:35.958
Yeah.

31:37.250 --> 31:41.041
Oh hey, I got some
plans with some friends later.

31:41.083 --> 31:42.542
I haven't seen Marcy in a while.

31:42.584 --> 31:46.208
Hope it's okay.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.125
Charlie?

31:48.042 --> 31:49.125
Is that cool?

31:50.125 --> 31:50.958
Char?

31:52.584 --> 31:53.458
Hello?

31:54.626 --> 31:56.458
Marcy? Yeah, of course.

32:00.167 --> 32:02.501
But you'll be home later, right?

32:02.543 --> 32:04.042
Of course, silly.

32:09.292 --> 32:10.958
Hope you have a great time.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.208
I love you.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.041
She's still
not there yet, is she?

32:30.083 --> 32:32.417
She is stuck in traffic.

32:32.459 --> 32:33.501
Hey, what time is it?

32:33.543 --> 32:35.916
Five o'clock
somewhere. Ha.

32:35.958 --> 32:37.958
Is that why you're calling me?

32:38.000 --> 32:39.000
Partially.

32:39.042 --> 32:40.166
I don't know.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.501
Why don't you look
at your phone?

32:41.543 --> 32:44.041
- No, seriously, can-
- Why don't you call Simone

32:44.083 --> 32:45.542
and ask her what time it is?

32:45.584 --> 32:48.542
Hey yo, can I get two more
and the check, please?

32:48.584 --> 32:50.000
Where'd you get those pants?

32:51.042 --> 32:52.376
Ooh.

32:52.418 --> 32:53.291
Turn around.

32:53.333 --> 32:54.501
Walk away.

32:54.543 --> 32:55.459
Thea.

32:55.501 --> 32:56.958
What?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.166
There's some really nice
butts in here, girl.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.333
Just, is it dark outside?

33:01.375 --> 33:03.543
- Tell me that.
- Are you fucking high?

33:05.042 --> 33:06.333
'Cause if you are, I'm
gonna be really be pissed-

33:06.375 --> 33:07.333
- No, I just-

33:07.375 --> 33:08.417
- That's you're high without me.

33:08.459 --> 33:10.166
Like, there is
something on my windows.

33:10.208 --> 33:11.333
I can't see outside.

33:11.375 --> 33:12.626
Hey, do
you have a charger?

33:12.667 --> 33:14.208
- For a phone?
- Oh my god.

33:14.250 --> 33:16.083
- A phone charger.
- Thea.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.083
What?

33:17.125 --> 33:18.166
What?

33:18.208 --> 33:21.625
- Did you hear me?
- What, it's on your windows?

33:21.667 --> 33:25.376
Yeah, it's like a
tarp or something.

33:27.250 --> 33:28.625
Ugh.

33:28.667 --> 33:30.376
I can't reach it
from the inside.

33:30.418 --> 33:32.666
Actually,
can I get another one?

33:32.708 --> 33:34.208
Maybe they tented your place.

33:34.250 --> 33:35.875
They did that to mine like
a couple of weeks ago.

33:35.917 --> 33:37.208
It's really annoying.

33:37.250 --> 33:38.459
Yeah, maybe.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.291
Fucking go
outside and check.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.417
Like, why are you

33:41.459 --> 33:42.625
- calling me?
- Because I can't

33:42.667 --> 33:45.250
- go outside, my front door is-
- Oh, fuck.

33:45.292 --> 33:46.376
Hey, um, do you-

33:46.418 --> 33:48.041
- What?
- Have a charger?

33:48.083 --> 33:49.542
Dude, my phone's about to die.

33:49.584 --> 33:51.666
Hey, do you have a charger?

33:51.708 --> 33:53.041
For a phone?

33:53.083 --> 33:54.334
You're still at
the Trap, right?

33:54.376 --> 33:56.000
Uh, yeah.

33:56.042 --> 33:58.083
Can I call you right back?

33:58.125 --> 33:59.708
- Yeah, but-
- What?

33:59.750 --> 34:01.376
Oh for fuck's sake.

34:01.418 --> 34:02.666
- Get fucked, motherfucker-
- Can you just come-

34:02.708 --> 34:05.666
- I'll fucking
smile when you die.

34:05.708 --> 34:08.125
That wasn't for you, it was
just some fucking creepy-

34:08.167 --> 34:09.333
- Thea.
- Fuck you!

34:10.292 --> 34:11.458
Oh my god.

34:11.501 --> 34:13.583
Dude, listen, my
phone's going to fucking die.

34:13.625 --> 34:15.417
Can I just, like,
call you right back?

34:15.458 --> 34:16.583
Just let me charge
up real quick.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.041
Yeah, but do you
know when that'll be?

34:18.083 --> 34:19.958
I'll call
you right back.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.292
Bye, bye.

34:21.333 --> 34:22.208
Thea?

34:23.083 --> 34:24.417
H...

34:24.458 --> 34:25.333
Dammit.

34:36.583 --> 34:37.458
Oh.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.791
Thank you for the wild flowers.

35:11.833 --> 35:13.625
You're
the wild flower.

35:16.501 --> 35:17.791
I love that.

35:17.833 --> 35:19.292
Turn over.

35:19.334 --> 35:20.250
No, the other way.

35:21.250 --> 35:22.459
What, like this?

35:22.501 --> 35:24.625
Mm-hm.

35:33.167 --> 35:35.750
I never thought of
myself as a wild anything.

35:35.792 --> 35:38.083
Wallflower, maybe.

35:39.418 --> 35:41.334
Everyone's different.

35:41.376 --> 35:42.334
Head and profile.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.208
You're my wildflower.

35:50.833 --> 35:52.542
I wish I could be...

35:56.293 --> 35:59.417
I don't know, more like you.

35:59.459 --> 36:01.042
- Silly.
- I do.

36:01.875 --> 36:02.708
You're...

36:06.376 --> 36:08.376
I want to be enough for you.

36:08.418 --> 36:09.708
Stop it. You are.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.376
Arch your neck a little.

36:22.376 --> 36:23.666
Hey.

36:25.125 --> 36:25.750
Come here.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.334
You're
distracting me.

36:28.376 --> 36:30.292
- Come here.
- Stop it, stop it,

36:30.334 --> 36:31.334
you're distracting me.

36:31.376 --> 36:32.541
You're distracting me!

36:32.583 --> 36:35.875
Stop it!

36:35.917 --> 36:37.583
People are fascinating.

36:40.708 --> 36:43.292
And strange, they're so strange.

36:43.334 --> 36:48.334
I love figuring out what
makes each one tick.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.209
The pieces of them.

36:52.750 --> 36:54.500
Literally, pieces.

36:55.750 --> 36:57.334
Their skulls...

36:58.667 --> 36:59.750
Bones...

37:01.667 --> 37:02.542
And heart.

37:04.209 --> 37:05.334
Their beliefs.

37:06.708 --> 37:07.583
Love.

37:37.792 --> 37:41.209
Okay.

37:46.458 --> 37:47.625
Hey Vito.

37:47.667 --> 37:50.625
It's Charlie Crane again
from apartment 1-R.

37:50.667 --> 37:53.251
Listen, I'm, I'm getting
kind of freaked out

37:53.293 --> 37:55.458
and since you're not picking up,

37:55.500 --> 37:58.416
I may have to call somebody
else about this door.

37:58.458 --> 37:59.833
Um...

37:59.875 --> 38:04.458
Yeah. Sorry, um, but I just
wanted to let you know, so.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.833
Have a good weekend. Okay.

38:06.875 --> 38:07.750
Sorry. Bye.

38:11.251 --> 38:12.625
911.
What's your emergency?

38:12.667 --> 38:15.625
Hi, I'm, uh, this
is really silly

38:15.667 --> 38:17.375
and I'm so sorry
to call you guys,

38:17.417 --> 38:19.417
but I'm not sure
what else to do.

38:20.667 --> 38:22.251
Sorry, I'm...

38:22.293 --> 38:24.416
I'm locked in my apartment.

38:24.458 --> 38:27.958
My front door gets stuck
sometimes and I tried my super,

38:28.000 --> 38:30.209
but of course he's not answering

38:30.251 --> 38:33.375
and my girlfriend should
be home soon, but I just-

38:33.417 --> 38:36.333
- Ma'am,
is this an emergency?

38:36.375 --> 38:37.833
I mean...

38:37.875 --> 38:38.708
Yes.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.209
Can you help me?

38:41.251 --> 38:43.625
Yes,
ma'am. What's your address?

38:43.667 --> 38:46.333
107 Forsyth
Street in Brooklyn.

38:46.375 --> 38:47.500
Apartment number?

38:47.542 --> 38:51.458
Uh, apartment
1-R, as in retro.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.833
Okay,
ma'am. Help is on the way.

38:52.875 --> 38:53.875
Thank you. Thank you so much.

38:53.917 --> 38:57.667
I really appreciate it-

38:59.875 --> 39:00.708
Thanks.

40:47.917 --> 40:52.875
Hello?

40:53.833 --> 40:56.583
God, are you, are you okay?

40:56.625 --> 41:01.583
There's
just no way.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.042
There's no way.

41:04.084 --> 41:05.541
There's no way.

41:05.583 --> 41:06.876
No way?

41:06.918 --> 41:09.959
No way out?

41:10.001 --> 41:12.416
Are you stuck, too?

41:12.458 --> 41:16.625
I, my um, my door jams
and it has before,

41:16.667 --> 41:18.542
so I'm stuck too.

41:19.708 --> 41:22.042
Are you locked in
your apartment?

41:24.918 --> 41:28.043
Hello?

41:32.043 --> 41:33.166
Please, please.

41:33.208 --> 41:34.375
I'm hurting.

41:34.417 --> 41:37.666
Will you, will you pray with me?

41:37.708 --> 41:40.708
Um...

41:40.750 --> 41:41.750
I don't...

41:42.667 --> 41:46.834
I mean I, I haven't in a while.

41:46.876 --> 41:47.918
- I just-
- Please.

41:49.043 --> 41:50.959
- Please pray with me.
- Oh, yeah, no.

41:51.001 --> 41:52.708
I'm sorry. Yeah, of course.

41:52.750 --> 41:56.458
Um, I'll pray with you.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.625
Sorry. Did you want me to-

42:08.667 --> 42:11.625
- We need the necklace.

42:11.667 --> 42:12.791
What did you say?

42:12.833 --> 42:14.541
To pray.

42:14.583 --> 42:15.876
We need the necklace.

42:15.918 --> 42:17.918
Go find your grandmother's
necklace, Charlene.

42:20.792 --> 42:22.500
Sorry. How do
you know my name?

42:25.125 --> 42:26.667
Have you been listening to me?

42:27.792 --> 42:30.500
Who are you?

42:30.542 --> 42:32.708
Huh?

42:32.750 --> 42:35.876
You know what? Mind your
own fucking business.

42:41.292 --> 42:42.625
Hey Thea.

42:42.667 --> 42:44.208
Hey Thea.

42:44.250 --> 42:46.708
Hey babe.

42:46.750 --> 42:48.166
- Listen-
- Hold on a sec.

42:48.208 --> 42:49.083
Sorry.

42:49.125 --> 42:50.583
Hold on a sec. Sorry.

42:50.625 --> 42:52.001
- Yeah.
- Sorry, just one second.

42:52.043 --> 42:53.666
Sorry,
just one second.

42:53.708 --> 42:55.042
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

42:55.083 --> 42:57.208
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

42:57.250 --> 42:58.750
What is wrong with you?

42:58.792 --> 43:00.959
Charlie, who
are you yelling at?

43:01.001 --> 43:02.666
Sorry, Thea, just two seconds.

43:02.708 --> 43:03.917
- This bitch.
- Bitch.

43:03.959 --> 43:06.500
Stop it. Fucking
stop it, fuck off!

43:06.542 --> 43:10.001
Fuck off!

43:10.042 --> 43:11.166
Sorry, Thea, I just-

43:11.208 --> 43:12.792
- Dude, is that fucking Simone?

43:12.834 --> 43:14.166
What's wrong?

43:14.208 --> 43:16.041
There's this, this woman
in the other apartment

43:16.083 --> 43:18.083
and I can hear her
through the wall.

43:18.125 --> 43:19.751
Yeah, I mean, it is Brooklyn.

43:19.793 --> 43:21.291
No, this is different.

43:21.333 --> 43:23.041
She can clearly hear me, too,

43:23.083 --> 43:24.792
because she won't stop repeating

43:24.834 --> 43:27.708
every goddamn word I say.

43:27.750 --> 43:28.876
Okay, that's creepy.

43:30.667 --> 43:33.250
And I've already called my
super twice about the door.

43:33.292 --> 43:37.125
Of course he's not
picking up, but

43:37.167 --> 43:38.666
it doesn't matter.

43:38.708 --> 43:40.751
It doesn't matter because
someone's on their way

43:40.793 --> 43:42.751
and I can get this
fixed before Simone-

43:42.793 --> 43:45.583
- Charlie, can you just
like stop for a second?

43:45.625 --> 43:46.792
Stop.

43:46.834 --> 43:49.125
Like, I really hate
to tell you this,

43:49.167 --> 43:50.834
but I don't think Simone's

43:50.876 --> 43:52.751
going to be coming
home anytime soon.

43:52.793 --> 43:54.792
Thea, I really don't
need this right now.

43:54.834 --> 43:56.291
Holden just posted a pic.

43:56.333 --> 43:58.709
The two of them are
like out at a bar.

43:58.751 --> 43:59.959
Simone is in the city.

44:00.000 --> 44:02.166
She's fucking living
it up right now.

44:02.208 --> 44:03.876
Go look for yourself.

44:03.918 --> 44:07.000
- That's an old photo.
- No, babe, it's not.

44:07.042 --> 44:09.250
It's on her story.
Go check, I'll wait.

44:38.709 --> 44:40.834
Charlie, I fucking
hate this, dude.

44:40.876 --> 44:45.166
I fucking hate this,
but like, I told you.

44:45.208 --> 44:48.208
- I tried to tell you.
- I um...

44:48.250 --> 44:49.751
- God.
- I gotta go.

44:52.250 --> 44:55.083
I have to wait for someone
to open my door so I'm gonna,

44:56.292 --> 44:58.333
I'm gonna sit here
and wait for that.

44:58.375 --> 45:01.041
No Charlie,
fuck that, don't do that.

45:01.083 --> 45:01.917
- I gotta go.
- Come on.

45:01.958 --> 45:02.834
No, Charlie-

45:24.751 --> 45:26.000
911,
what's your emergency?

45:26.042 --> 45:29.958
Hi. I called
a little while ago.

45:30.000 --> 45:31.291
I'm locked inside my apartment

45:31.333 --> 45:33.000
and I think someone
should be here by now-

45:33.042 --> 45:34.751
- 911,
what's your emergency?

45:34.793 --> 45:37.083
My emergency
is that I am locked

45:37.125 --> 45:40.250
inside my apartment
and I need help, okay?

45:40.292 --> 45:44.166
Again, my address is 107
Forsyth Street in Brooklyn.

45:44.208 --> 45:47.166
Ma'am,
is this an emergency?

45:47.208 --> 45:49.250
Yes, it is.

45:49.292 --> 45:54.292
I am locked inside my apartment
and I want to get out.

45:55.793 --> 45:56.709
Yes,
ma'am. What's your address?

45:56.751 --> 45:58.083
Oh my god. I just told you.

45:58.125 --> 46:02.667
107 Forsyth Street in
Brooklyn, apartment 1-R.

46:02.709 --> 46:03.333
Apartment number?

46:03.375 --> 46:04.250
What the fu...

46:05.208 --> 46:07.166
Are you even listening to me?

46:07.208 --> 46:08.751
- I just said apartment 1-
- Okay ma'am.

46:08.793 --> 46:09.793
Help is on the way.

46:12.875 --> 46:15.792
What apartment number
did I just tell you?

46:21.000 --> 46:22.709
- Hello?
- Okay ma'am.

46:22.751 --> 46:23.792
Help is on the way.

46:23.834 --> 46:25.333
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

46:25.375 --> 46:27.291
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

46:27.333 --> 46:28.375
Okay ma'am...

46:30.000 --> 46:31.751
Okay ma'am, help is on the way.

46:32.875 --> 46:34.833
She doesn't care.

46:34.875 --> 46:36.916
She's never coming back for you.

46:36.958 --> 46:40.292
No one's going to
save you, Charlene.

46:47.917 --> 46:49.751
Hey, hello?

46:49.793 --> 46:50.751
Hello? Please turn around.

46:50.793 --> 46:52.958
I'm in apartment 1-R,
I'm right behind you.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.458
Please help me open this door.

46:54.500 --> 46:55.333
Please help
me open this door.

46:55.375 --> 46:56.709
Please.

46:56.751 --> 46:57.916
- Do you hear me?
- Do you hear me?

46:57.958 --> 46:58.875
- Please help me.
- Please help me!

46:58.917 --> 47:00.958
Shut up and leave me alone!

47:04.875 --> 47:06.792
Please.

47:06.833 --> 47:08.000
Please.

47:08.042 --> 47:09.208
Charlie, what the fuck?

47:10.375 --> 47:12.751
What, are you fucking
following me now?

47:12.792 --> 47:14.041
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:14.083 --> 47:16.833
You're just sitting in
my own fucking house

47:16.875 --> 47:18.250
not letting me in?

47:18.292 --> 47:19.416
Are you kidding?

47:19.458 --> 47:22.083
This is my goddamn home.

47:22.125 --> 47:23.751
I don't ever want
to see you again

47:23.792 --> 47:26.042
unless you're moving your
shit out of my house.

47:28.500 --> 47:29.875
Please. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

47:29.917 --> 47:31.501
Please. I just want to
be with you right now.

47:31.543 --> 47:32.375
No, no, Charlie.

47:32.417 --> 47:34.375
You want to be me.

47:34.417 --> 47:36.375
I cannot take a fucking breath

47:36.417 --> 47:38.083
without you inhaling, too.

47:38.125 --> 47:40.000
You're always right behind me,

47:40.042 --> 47:41.375
following me like
a fucking shadow!

47:41.417 --> 47:43.458
I just want to make
sure you're safe.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.375
What the fuck are you
even talking about safe?

47:45.417 --> 47:46.875
I was out with my friends.

47:46.917 --> 47:48.208
I know, they're
they're my friends t-

47:48.250 --> 47:50.000
- No, they are not your friends.

47:50.042 --> 47:52.291
This is exactly what
I am talking about.

47:52.333 --> 47:55.083
They're not your friends.
This is not your house.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.958
This is not your life.
They are my friends.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.333
This is my house.

47:59.375 --> 48:02.125
This is my life, and I
will not let you continue

48:02.167 --> 48:04.250
to fucking hijack everything!

48:04.292 --> 48:05.501
I know, I know, I know!

48:05.543 --> 48:07.291
I'm sorry, all right?

48:07.333 --> 48:08.501
I'm sorry.

48:08.543 --> 48:10.041
Please. Please, just
come back inside.

48:10.083 --> 48:12.375
I just, you're just
gone all the time.

48:12.417 --> 48:13.875
Why aren't you ever here?

48:13.917 --> 48:16.250
Why aren't you ever here?

48:16.292 --> 48:17.167
Huh?

48:50.917 --> 48:52.584
I don't care if you're out.

48:52.626 --> 48:54.291
Just answer your goddamn-

49:03.668 --> 49:04.501
Simone?

49:33.333 --> 49:34.208
Simone?

49:37.543 --> 49:41.000
Simone?

49:46.250 --> 49:50.208
Simone?

52:19.625 --> 52:20.500
Fuck.

52:31.708 --> 52:34.166
Please turn around.

52:34.208 --> 52:36.209
Please, please, help me!

54:06.625 --> 54:08.209
Come on.

54:10.500 --> 54:13.500
911, what's your...

54:19.209 --> 54:20.209
This isn't happening.
This isn't real.

54:20.251 --> 54:21.334
None of this is real.

54:21.375 --> 54:22.251
What do you want?

54:22.293 --> 54:23.833
I need help, please.

54:28.667 --> 54:29.542
Please.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.583
Please, please,
please pick up, pick-

54:57.625 --> 54:58.916
Thea. Oh, thank God.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.583
Where, where are you right now?

55:01.583 --> 55:03.500
I'm at the bar still.

55:03.542 --> 55:06.666
The bartender let
me use her charger.

55:06.708 --> 55:08.292
Is, uh, Simone not there yet?

55:08.333 --> 55:09.500
No, she's not.

55:09.542 --> 55:11.916
And there's so much
happening right now.

55:11.958 --> 55:14.416
I found someone's
phone in the basement.

55:14.458 --> 55:16.666
I called 911
because I can't get,

55:16.708 --> 55:19.666
I can't get anyone to help
me right now, including you.

55:19.708 --> 55:21.000
I said I'd be
there when I'm done.

55:21.042 --> 55:22.583
Yeah, but you're not here.

55:22.625 --> 55:24.875
I need you, Thea. I need help.

55:24.917 --> 55:27.791
And 911 isn't working.

55:27.833 --> 55:29.458
It's like a recording
or something.

55:29.500 --> 55:30.750
It sounds like, I don't...

55:30.792 --> 55:32.000
I need...

55:32.042 --> 55:34.708
No one will come
here and help me.

55:34.750 --> 55:35.625
And I...

55:36.667 --> 55:37.875
Goddamn.

55:37.917 --> 55:39.583
I...

55:39.625 --> 55:42.916
I found the necklace,
but my mom fucking,

55:42.958 --> 55:47.291
god, she hates me and
Simone isn't coming home

55:47.333 --> 55:50.042
because I'm boring and I
can't do anything right.

55:50.084 --> 55:51.791
I ruin fucking
everything I touch.

55:51.833 --> 55:53.000
I don't know what to do.

56:01.458 --> 56:05.666
Thea?

56:05.708 --> 56:08.251
Thea, where are you right now?

56:09.084 --> 56:11.375
You're not here.

56:12.542 --> 56:14.042
Thea, I need you to come here

56:14.084 --> 56:16.375
and let me out of here, okay?

56:16.417 --> 56:17.792
I need that as a friend.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.750
- I can't help you, Charlie.
- Why?

56:21.917 --> 56:23.333
Why can't you
come and help me?

56:25.458 --> 56:26.375
Thea.

56:26.417 --> 56:27.333
What is that...

56:28.667 --> 56:32.625
What is that sound? Are
you, are you at the beach?

56:32.667 --> 56:35.583
- You're not here.
- Thea.

56:35.625 --> 56:36.666
What are you talking about?

56:36.708 --> 56:38.583
- I...
- You're not here.

56:39.625 --> 56:40.917
You're not here.

56:42.583 --> 56:44.458
- You're never here.
- Thea.

56:44.500 --> 56:47.375
You're never here.

56:48.542 --> 56:49.708
Thea, don't.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.292
I can't hear you.
Don't walk away.

56:53.375 --> 56:56.375
Thea, come back. I, I am scared.

56:56.417 --> 56:58.917
I am your friend and I am
fucking scared right now.

56:58.959 --> 56:59.792
I need you.

57:00.875 --> 57:01.750
Thea?

57:02.667 --> 57:04.084
God.

57:12.001 --> 57:13.792
I love you.

57:15.168 --> 57:16.084
I need you.

57:17.917 --> 57:19.375
You're not here.

57:26.458 --> 57:27.333
Hello?

57:28.625 --> 57:30.791
Ma'am, are you okay?

57:30.833 --> 57:31.708
No way out?

57:32.792 --> 57:34.458
Are you stuck, too?

57:35.126 --> 57:37.541
You're not here.

57:37.583 --> 57:38.833
You're not here.

57:39.750 --> 57:41.001
You're not here.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.583
You're not here.

57:43.625 --> 57:45.416
You're not here.

57:45.458 --> 57:46.625
You're not here.

57:46.667 --> 57:48.126
You're not here.

57:48.167 --> 57:50.126
You're not here,
you're not here.

57:50.167 --> 57:55.333
You're not here.

58:22.876 --> 58:26.042
Where does it all come from?

58:26.084 --> 58:31.084
Because in reality, we're
all just animals in a pit,

58:33.001 --> 58:38.001
fucking and fighting
and trying to make...

58:40.125 --> 58:42.001
Make everything seem
like it matters.

58:45.084 --> 58:47.750
You put two people in the
room long enough together,

58:49.084 --> 58:53.001
they're either gonna end up
fucking or killing each other.

58:56.667 --> 58:57.542
Or both.

59:00.250 --> 59:01.125
And you scared?

59:05.542 --> 59:06.792
I'm scared, too.

59:14.083 --> 59:16.876
You're not here.

59:16.918 --> 59:18.417
You're not here.

59:19.918 --> 59:21.167
You're not here.

59:23.500 --> 59:24.792
You're not here.

59:26.667 --> 59:27.959
You're not here.

59:29.792 --> 59:32.583
You're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

59:32.625 --> 59:35.500
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

59:35.542 --> 59:39.667
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here.

59:43.292 --> 59:44.750
You're not here.

59:46.250 --> 59:47.793
You're not here.

59:49.250 --> 59:50.708
You're not here.

59:52.500 --> 59:53.793
You're not here.

59:54.708 --> 59:57.666
You're not here,
you're not here.

59:57.708 --> 01:00:00.959
You're not here,
you are not here.

01:00:01.001 --> 01:00:01.917
You're not here.

01:00:01.959 --> 01:00:02.917
You're not here.

01:00:02.959 --> 01:00:05.917
You're not here,
you're not here.

01:00:05.959 --> 01:00:07.583
You're not here.

01:00:07.625 --> 01:00:09.125
You are not here.

01:00:09.167 --> 01:00:10.959
You are not here.

01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:12.583
You are not here.

01:00:13.583 --> 01:00:14.959
- Huh?
- You're not here,

01:00:15.001 --> 01:00:17.166
you're not here, you're
not here, you're not here,

01:00:17.208 --> 01:00:19.125
you're not here.

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:20.792
I'm here.

01:00:20.834 --> 01:00:22.751
You're not here.

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:24.041
You're not here.

01:00:24.083 --> 01:00:25.792
You're not here.

01:00:25.834 --> 01:00:27.792
You're not here.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:29.834
You're not here.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.125
- You're not-
- If I'm not here,

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:32.625
you're not here.

01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:39.500
You're not fucking here!

01:00:39.542 --> 01:00:41.166
You hear me?

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:44.166
You're not fucking here!

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:45.291
Shut up.

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:46.876
Shut up, goddammit!

01:00:46.918 --> 01:00:48.250
Shut up!

01:00:48.292 --> 01:00:49.541
Shut up!

01:00:49.583 --> 01:00:50.333
Shut up.

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:51.876
Shut up. Shut up.

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:59.000
It's never gonna stop.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:02.625
It's never gonna stop.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:03.793
I need my mom.

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:08.709
I need my mom, I
just, I need my mom.

01:01:10.125 --> 01:01:13.667
I need my mom.

01:01:13.709 --> 01:01:16.583
I need my mom, I
need my mom. Mom.

01:01:23.751 --> 01:01:24.583
Come on.

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:27.709
Come on.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:37.876
Mom?

01:01:41.793 --> 01:01:43.333
Oh my God, mom.

01:01:43.375 --> 01:01:44.917
Charlene?

01:01:44.958 --> 01:01:46.916
Mom, mom, oh my god.
Oh thank god you're here.

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:49.876
Please help me. I need
your help right now.

01:01:49.917 --> 01:01:51.125
Look at you.

01:01:51.167 --> 01:01:52.041
Of course you need help.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.208
No, no, no, no.

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.916
Mom, I am stuck in
my apartment, okay?

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:57.709
I can't get out and I need you-

01:01:57.751 --> 01:01:59.876
- This was your choice, Charlie.

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:01.125
It was your choice,
Charlene, to leave.

01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:05.751
No, no, no, no. Mom,
I need your help, okay?

01:02:05.793 --> 01:02:07.876
I need your help right
now because I, I-

01:02:07.917 --> 01:02:09.709
- You need God's help, Charlene.

01:02:09.751 --> 01:02:10.916
Look at you.

01:02:10.958 --> 01:02:13.125
Drunk or high with
that wicked woman.

01:02:13.167 --> 01:02:15.751
No, look, I have,
I have the necklace

01:02:15.793 --> 01:02:16.709
and I can bring it home,

01:02:16.751 --> 01:02:18.834
but you just have to help me.

01:02:18.876 --> 01:02:21.250
No, no, no.

01:02:21.292 --> 01:02:22.125
No.

01:02:22.167 --> 01:02:24.083
No, she loves me.

01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:25.709
She loves me.

01:02:25.751 --> 01:02:27.751
She told me she loves me.

01:02:27.793 --> 01:02:31.125
I love her so much and
she, she won't come home.

01:02:31.167 --> 01:02:32.375
She won't...

01:02:32.417 --> 01:02:33.916
There's no love
in you, Charlene.

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.292
Charlene, Charlene, Charlene.

01:02:37.793 --> 01:02:40.416
God's help, there's
something we can...

01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:42.834
Breathe for you,
breathe for you.

01:02:42.875 --> 01:02:44.125
You are alone, Charlene.

01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:48.792
You are alone, Charlene.

01:02:48.834 --> 01:02:50.416
You will forever be alone.

01:02:50.458 --> 01:02:52.083
Your choice.

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:53.000
God.

01:02:53.042 --> 01:02:54.083
Pray. Your grandmother.

01:02:54.125 --> 01:02:56.250
Your grandmother-

01:02:56.292 --> 01:02:57.416
Stop.

01:03:00.292 --> 01:03:02.291
I need you to help me.

01:03:02.333 --> 01:03:03.917
My mother!

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.125
Stop.

01:03:09.167 --> 01:03:13.125
Mom.

01:03:14.793 --> 01:03:16.333
I just need you need to stop it!

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:58.501
Stop.

01:03:58.543 --> 01:03:59.375
Please.

01:04:15.417 --> 01:04:16.833
No, no, no, no, no.

01:04:16.875 --> 01:04:18.208
No, no, no.

01:04:24.458 --> 01:04:25.333
Barker.

01:05:09.042 --> 01:05:11.083
Please. What's happening?

01:05:12.208 --> 01:05:14.125
Why are you doing this?

01:05:15.917 --> 01:05:17.291
Are you doing this?

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:19.833
She's not coming back.

01:05:19.875 --> 01:05:21.167
She doesn't care.

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:27.292
Who?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.250
I don't understand.

01:05:30.292 --> 01:05:32.083
She's not coming.

01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:33.375
She doesn't care.

01:05:33.417 --> 01:05:37.501
She doesn't care, she's
never coming back.

01:05:39.375 --> 01:05:41.375
She's never coming back.

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:45.208
No.

01:05:47.584 --> 01:05:49.041
No.

01:05:49.083 --> 01:05:50.375
She loves me.

01:05:50.417 --> 01:05:52.000
Where is she?

01:05:52.042 --> 01:05:54.333
- She loves me.
- Where is she?

01:05:54.375 --> 01:05:55.333
Wild flower?

01:05:55.375 --> 01:05:58.125
- She loves me.
- Where is she?

01:05:58.167 --> 01:05:59.501
Where is she?

01:06:01.042 --> 01:06:02.584
Where is she?

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:03.917
Where is she?

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:05.958
Where is she?

01:06:07.459 --> 01:06:08.501
Where is she?

01:06:09.626 --> 01:06:11.125
Where did she go?

01:06:11.167 --> 01:06:13.291
Where did she go?

01:06:13.333 --> 01:06:15.083
- Where is she?
- Who are you?

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:16.000
Where is she?

01:06:16.042 --> 01:06:17.543
Where, where is she?

01:06:19.543 --> 01:06:21.208
- Where, where-
- Who, who are you?

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.041
- Where is she?
- Who are you?

01:06:23.083 --> 01:06:25.333
Who are
you, who are you?

01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:30.250
Who are you, who are you?

01:09:35.082 --> 01:09:37.334
Please, please, please
are you still there?

01:09:37.376 --> 01:09:39.041
Please, please.

01:09:39.082 --> 01:09:40.251
Please help me.

01:09:40.292 --> 01:09:41.625
I'm so sorry.

I'm so sorry. Please,
I need your help.

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:45.500
Please.

01:09:46.875 --> 01:09:48.582
Are you still there?

01:10:00.708 --> 01:10:02.376
Charlie?

01:10:04.251 --> 01:10:05.500
Please, Charlie!

01:10:08.583 --> 01:10:09.417
Baby?

01:10:38.917 --> 01:10:41.126
Please, Charlie.

01:10:41.168 --> 01:10:42.209
Just stop.

01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:43.125
Her.

01:10:45.376 --> 01:10:46.708
It's not you.

01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:47.792
It's not you.

01:10:49.583 --> 01:10:52.583
- I know that's not-
- Can you please stop?

01:10:52.625 --> 01:10:56.209
Please.

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.458
Charlie, please.

01:10:58.792 --> 01:11:00.667
Charlie, please, don't.

01:11:41.833 --> 01:11:42.875
Who's here?

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:48.875
Charlie.

01:11:50.542 --> 01:11:51.417
Simone.

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:54.750
- Charlie, Charlie.
- Are you here?

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:55.666
Charlie.

Stop,
Charlie! Make it stop!

01:13:57.375 --> 01:13:58.667
What did you do?

01:14:03.126 --> 01:14:08.084
What did you do?

01:14:13.833 --> 01:14:14.583

01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:20.583
Charlie...

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:58.001
No, no, no, no.

01:14:58.043 --> 01:14:59.417
No, no, no, no!

Somebody!

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:33.084
Help me!

01:15:40.792 --> 01:15:41.876
No, no, no.

01:15:41.918 --> 01:15:42.876
No, no.

01:15:42.918 --> 01:15:44.417
This isn't real.

01:16:12.292 --> 01:16:13.792
Charlie girl.
