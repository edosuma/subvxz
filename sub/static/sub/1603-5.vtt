00:01.935 --> 00:03.836
<i> Previously on</i> Empire...

00:03.838 --> 00:06.171
I have ALS, they said I got,
like, three years at best.

00:06.173 --> 00:08.340
What if your two
brothers went to war?

00:08.342 --> 00:10.042
They just may
kill each other.

00:10.044 --> 00:12.444
Come out,
and you're on your own.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.346
In addition to
managing Jamal,

00:14.348 --> 00:18.283
I'm also handling this label's
fiercest female artist.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.786
Hakeem and Tiana are
this year's it couple.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.988
If you're not prolific,
Jamal's gonna catch up to you.

00:22.990 --> 00:25.858
♪ Dollar, dollar bill, y'all. ♪

00:25.860 --> 00:27.393
You think Jamal more
talented than me?

00:27.395 --> 00:29.361
You are going
to inherit the kingdom.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.030
Dad, when are we gonna
shoot my video?

00:31.032 --> 00:33.365
The songs that I'm writing
will only further prove

00:33.367 --> 00:34.500
that I'm you
but on steroids.

00:34.502 --> 00:35.734
Did you tell Lucious

00:35.736 --> 00:37.202
about the deal I
have with the Feds?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.838
You're my big sister,
I ain't told nobody nothing.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.641
We need you to testify
in front of a grand jury.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.643
You gonna get me killed.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.380
(photographers clamoring)

00:50.150 --> 00:52.818
Here they are, the couple
whose red-hot duet

00:52.820 --> 00:55.854
burned up last week's Teen
Choice Awards Special.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.689
Tiana, girl, you
are fabulous.

00:57.691 --> 00:58.924
Thank you.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.893
And the son of music
industry legend,

01:00.895 --> 01:02.261
Lucious Lyon.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.563
Yeah, he has
his own name.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.432
Of course, so, Hakeem,

01:06.434 --> 01:09.334
do you think your career
would be as hot as it is now

01:09.336 --> 01:11.336
if you weren't the
son of Lucious Lyon?

01:11.338 --> 01:13.005
I'm about to drop
this big-ass video

01:13.007 --> 01:14.573
from my, uh, single,
"Drip Drop."

01:14.575 --> 01:16.275
And I hope everybody
tune into that.

01:16.277 --> 01:17.843
Y'all gonna tune in?

01:17.845 --> 01:19.745
TIANA: And soon everyone's
gonna be referring

01:19.747 --> 01:21.513
to Lucious as Hakeem
Lyon's father.

01:21.515 --> 01:23.382
Right, babe?

01:23.384 --> 01:24.917
You heard it here first.

01:24.919 --> 01:27.453
"Drip Drop" from Lucious
Lyon's son, Hakeem.

01:34.594 --> 01:36.895
Yo, man, act like you
got some manners, dawg.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.564
Hey, not everything
got to go on the Vine.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.199
Babe, you coming to
my house tonight?

01:40.201 --> 01:41.967
Not tonight, bae.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.269
I have studio
all day tomorrow.

01:45.238 --> 01:47.906
Hold up, hold
up, hold up.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.041
You killed it tonight.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.877
How you had my back.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.378
Really feeling
me like that?

01:53.380 --> 01:54.847
Yeah.

later, okay?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.495
(both laugh)

04:30.703 --> 04:32.638
What's up, y'all?

04:32.640 --> 04:34.873
And before you start
judging, just know

04:34.875 --> 04:36.708
a lot of hits came out
of this place, you know?

04:36.710 --> 04:38.110
Excuse you.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.945
What's up, man?
It's all good.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.947
(sighs) We didn't have
to come down here, Jamal.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.715
We could've had this producer
come to us,

04:43.717 --> 04:45.450
to a real studio.
Shh.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.386
You need to watch your
back around here, Mal.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.121
Some real hungry,
grimy types, you know?

04:49.123 --> 04:52.124
Well, this is all I can afford.
Lucious can take all that money.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.293
He can give it to Hakeem.
This right here is mine.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.228
All right. Well,
you do you, baby.

04:56.230 --> 04:58.463
You keeping it ghetto,
that's for sure.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.465
If this is the sound you want

05:00.467 --> 05:02.467
and you think it's gonna
put you ahead of Hakeem,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.469
then this is what
we doing, baby.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.071
Your daddy would be proud,

05:06.073 --> 05:07.906
even though he won't admit it.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.142
What the hell?

05:10.144 --> 05:12.277
It's fine.
It's fine.

05:12.279 --> 05:14.012
(knocking)
Yo.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.248
You trying to make some
money up in here? Ma.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.749
The hell you got us, Jamal?
Shh.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.686
Bullet holes...

05:20.688 --> 05:22.688
What's up,
man?

05:22.690 --> 05:25.524
You can barely
afford this.

05:25.526 --> 05:27.959
With your budget, you get one day.
All right.

05:27.961 --> 05:30.462
(phone chimes) So you'd better
record like you mean it.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.664
Yeah.

05:34.434 --> 05:37.069
Mal, come here.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.339
I got to go handle
some stuff, okay?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.607
What you mean you got to... You
gonna be all right in here?

05:42.609 --> 05:45.944
Yeah, but you s... Okay. Don't
you pay these suckers a dime

05:45.946 --> 05:48.347
until you get everything
you need, you hear me?

05:48.349 --> 05:49.514
Yeah.
All right.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.116
Tyree? That's you?

05:51.118 --> 05:53.785
You take care
of my baby boy, okay?

05:53.787 --> 05:57.155
If not... I'm holding.

05:57.157 --> 05:59.591
The name's Cookie.
Ask about me.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.628
That's your moms?

06:03.630 --> 06:04.963
Yeah, man.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.801
(sighs)

06:12.038 --> 06:13.472
Get in the car.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.073
I told you I'd meet you
at my apartment.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.742
We got to talk.

06:16.744 --> 06:19.010
Didn't I tell you not to hang on me?
Uh-huh.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.313
Y'all gonna get me killed,
putting me on blast like this.

06:23.649 --> 06:25.384
(sighs)

06:27.320 --> 06:31.323
We're following you
because you need protection.

06:31.325 --> 06:32.758
You Feds don't care
about my little life.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.593
You're following me
just to make sure

06:34.595 --> 06:36.194
I don't blow off testifying.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.697
Now, I done told you once,
I don't like talking

06:38.699 --> 06:41.833
about that part of my life,
especially in front of a judge.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.235
Grand jury proceedings
are private.

06:43.237 --> 06:45.103
Your testimony
is sealed.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.038
No one is gonna know.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.241
I don't feel right about this.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.910
Something deep down in my heart
is telling me

06:51.912 --> 06:55.347
I am gonna suffer badly
if I get on that stand.

06:55.349 --> 06:57.015
For 17 years,
you kept your mouth shut

06:57.017 --> 06:58.884
about what Frank Gathers did,
right?

06:58.886 --> 07:03.121
Now his lawyers have viable
appeal to get him out.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.925
Help us make sure he never gets
out for the rest of his life.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.094
Does that mean
I won't have to see you again?

07:09.096 --> 07:10.762
Hopefully.

07:26.146 --> 07:29.481
Okay, so here's how
I'm approaching things now, Pop,

07:29.483 --> 07:32.818
including my new video
for "Drip Drop."

07:32.820 --> 07:34.252
I don't want
to win this game.

07:34.254 --> 07:36.688
I want to change it.

07:37.423 --> 07:38.924
That's what 50 did

07:38.926 --> 07:40.091
with the water.

07:40.093 --> 07:42.093
That's what Dre did
with the Beats.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.495
But if I'm-a do that,

07:43.497 --> 07:45.597
I got to re-create myself.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.633
No offense, Dad. I can't be
Lucious Lyon's son no more.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.902
I got to play to people's
fantasies to what they think

07:50.904 --> 07:52.170
it's like to be Keem.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.405
Plus, Jamal
is going

07:53.407 --> 07:55.140
into the studio with a song

07:55.142 --> 07:56.408
that he thinks
is the one already.

07:56.410 --> 07:58.910
So we got
to be audacious.

07:58.912 --> 08:03.248
We show them I'm the king,
I bet you they believe it.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.851
(Anika chuckles)
I love it.

08:05.853 --> 08:08.854
Well, unfortunately, the one law
of business states that, uh,

08:08.856 --> 08:11.289
this video is about
a million dollars over budget.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.290
So...
Yo, Pop,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.292
you put everything into me,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.661
and I know you believe in me.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.330
I'm just now starting
to believe in myself,

08:18.332 --> 08:19.698
and I know you see that.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.132
I see it.

08:21.134 --> 08:23.869
And you came
with straight heat today.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.538
And I saw your vision as clearly

08:26.540 --> 08:28.673
as I see
your face.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.711
(chuckling)

08:32.713 --> 08:34.546
You got it.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.047
Dre's gonna find
the money.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.716
ANIKA:
Come on, Keem.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.218
Let's do this.
(chuckles)

08:46.559 --> 08:51.062
Dad, the auditors are going
through every dime we spend.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.498
Line by line.
This is triple

08:53.500 --> 08:55.467
what's allocated
for Hakeem's project.

08:55.469 --> 08:57.869
What did you think
about his song?

08:57.871 --> 09:00.038
"Drip Drop"? It's good, I guess.

09:01.407 --> 09:04.009
Dre, if you can't find the money
for this,

09:04.011 --> 09:06.311
I really don't know
what purpose you serve.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.384
RHONDA:
Wait. Give me one sec.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.386
Hold on. This is off-center.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.222
Okay. All right, go ahead.

09:17.224 --> 09:19.491
I really can't be here.

09:19.493 --> 09:22.394
I got to go find the money
to finance my own demise.

09:22.396 --> 09:25.797
Just... come with me.
Turn around for me.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.501
This is such
a lose-lose situation.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.002
We will find a way.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.405
We always do. And you
know that I would not

09:33.407 --> 09:36.508
have pulled you down here
if it wasn't important.

09:36.510 --> 09:39.110
God loves us.

09:39.112 --> 09:42.414
And he sent us
a little gift

09:42.416 --> 09:44.349
in our time of need.

09:44.351 --> 09:48.186
So you can flip this
lose-lose into a win for Andre

09:48.188 --> 09:50.155
and a meltdown
for Hakeem.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.426
You are amazing.

09:54.428 --> 09:57.429
MAN: Relax, Mrs. Lyon. This
isn't about what you did.

09:57.431 --> 10:00.065
This is about what you saw.

10:00.067 --> 10:03.068
Here you are selling bags
of cocaine

10:03.070 --> 10:06.071
stamped with the red rose
of Frank Gathers' organization

10:06.073 --> 10:09.641
to this man in
the gray sweatshirt.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.351
Come with it.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.656
Did you witness the man
in the sweatshirt get shot

10:24.658 --> 10:27.726
in the course of
this transaction?

10:29.095 --> 10:33.098
It was a lot happening
all at once.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.266
(siren wailing)

10:35.268 --> 10:37.168
FBI! Get down!

10:37.170 --> 10:39.804
Did you see who shot him?

10:45.611 --> 10:48.213
(gunshot)
(grunts)

10:51.117 --> 10:53.585
That's a yes.

10:56.122 --> 10:58.590
Can you name
that shooter?

10:58.592 --> 11:00.725
(gunshots)

11:11.604 --> 11:14.172
Frank Gathers.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.609
You witnessed
Frank Gathers

11:17.611 --> 11:21.746
shoot FBI Special Agent
Daniel Koenig?

11:23.115 --> 11:25.116
He was a Fed?

11:28.821 --> 11:30.155
CARTER:
Cookie, Cookie, listen to me.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.956
You tricked me.
Listen...

11:31.958 --> 11:34.325
Why didn't you tell me
that buyer was an undercover?

11:34.327 --> 11:37.062
Do you know what kind of animal
kills a federal agent?

11:37.064 --> 11:39.330
Yes, I do-- the kind
that spends his life

11:39.332 --> 11:41.066
behind bars, thanks to you.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.867
Thanks to me is right.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.803
I just snitched
on him in court.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.739
Dead bitch walking--
that's me out here right now.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.874
Cookie, the reason why
grand jury proceedings

11:49.876 --> 11:52.377
are secret is to protect
witnesses like you.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.179
Lady...

11:54.181 --> 11:57.082
men like Frank Gathers
reach right from prison

11:57.084 --> 11:59.718
and drop people
dead every day.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.320
Now, can you protect me or not?
(elevator bell dings)

12:02.322 --> 12:04.756
Right. I thought so.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.900
LUCIOUS:
We've got to do better, people.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.602
This isn't what
We've goI'm looking for.people.

12:26.178 --> 12:27.846
What's up, man?

12:27.848 --> 12:29.280
I've got good
news, Dad.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.182
I figured out a way
to pay for everything

12:31.184 --> 12:33.118
Hakeem wants
for his video.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.187
So, we feature another
artist with him,

12:36.189 --> 12:38.456
and we take the money from
that promotion budget.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.258
Who do you have in mind?

12:40.260 --> 12:42.393
Tiana. Everybody
loves them together.

12:42.395 --> 12:45.063
(sighing): Hmm... And we should be the
ones to capitalize on that, right?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.798
There's no way around this?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.733
Yeah, that's smart,
but now you gotta figure out

12:48.735 --> 12:50.869
how to deal with her manager.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.537
Cookie.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.373
Yeah, your mama.
Yeah.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.909
You can handle it.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.310
Okay.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.045
Hey.

13:01.047 --> 13:03.047
Good man.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.382
Appreciate this.

13:04.384 --> 13:06.251
Thank you, Dad.

13:06.253 --> 13:08.253
(Vernon speaks
indistinctly)

13:08.255 --> 13:10.421
Holler later, man.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.823
Yo.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.792
What?

13:13.794 --> 13:15.627
VERNON:
<i> We got a bigger problem.</i>

13:15.629 --> 13:17.228
Underwriters are insisting

13:17.230 --> 13:20.632
we get a key man policy
for the IPO.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.666
That ain't no issue.

13:21.668 --> 13:22.934
I already told them...
No.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.135
...that if something
happened to me,

13:24.137 --> 13:25.336
one of my sons is
gonna take over.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.404
No, that's not
gonna work.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.739
We're gonna
need a doctor

13:27.741 --> 13:29.174
to certify that you're
in good health,

13:29.176 --> 13:30.842
and he's gonna need
to sign that policy;

13:30.844 --> 13:32.043
otherwise,
we ain't going public.

13:37.583 --> 13:40.151
You know,
I asked Anika to marry me.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.288
Gave her an
18-karat

13:43.290 --> 13:45.023
diamond ring.

13:45.025 --> 13:48.660
Same ring that Richard Burton
gave to Elizabeth Taylor.

13:52.531 --> 13:56.134
She's got this big-time
doctor as a father.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.269
Yeah?

13:58.271 --> 14:01.005
And you're gonna try
to get him to sign this policy?

14:01.007 --> 14:03.308
Remember the first
time I got engaged?

14:03.310 --> 14:05.977
Had that huge party?
Yeah.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.712
The one I'm still paying for.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.048
Yeah, that's this week.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.649
And?

14:11.651 --> 14:13.184
Our anniversary.

14:14.186 --> 14:16.788
Me and the Cookie Monster.

14:16.790 --> 14:19.824
COOKIE:<i> Jamal, I'll meet you</i>
<i> at the studio.</i>

14:19.826 --> 14:23.328
Look, baby, I know
how important this is, okay?

14:23.330 --> 14:24.863
Don't stress. Don't stress.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.631
You know how important
this is to me.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.533
Means more to me
than anything in the world.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.301
Okay.

14:38.811 --> 14:41.946
(door creaking shut in distance)

14:50.656 --> 14:52.657
Carter, I need to reach you.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.192
Call me right away.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.427
Somebody's trying to kill me.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.252
(gasps)

15:21.254 --> 15:22.854
What the hell are you doing,

15:22.856 --> 15:25.223
standing there like
a phantom for?

15:25.225 --> 15:27.058
Did you leave that rose?

15:27.060 --> 15:28.760
This was on your doorstep.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.396
Get in here.
Get in here, Dre!

15:31.398 --> 15:32.697
Are you okay?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.799
Uh...

15:34.801 --> 15:36.267
yeah, I'm just in a rush.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.236
Uh, Mal's up at that
Ghetto Ass Studio,

15:38.238 --> 15:40.872
and I don't like leaving him up
there on his own. Which studio?

15:40.874 --> 15:42.774
That's the name.
Look, what you want, Dre?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.809
Something you're afraid
I'm gonna say no to?

15:48.781 --> 15:50.148
(sighs)

15:50.150 --> 15:52.717
Dad wants Tiana to guest
on Hakeem's video.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.652
It's shooting today.
No.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.821
Man, you got to go, Andre.
Mom...

15:56.823 --> 16:00.058
I have way more important things to...
Mom, please!

16:01.794 --> 16:04.262
Dad's putting me under
a lot of pressure here, okay?

16:04.264 --> 16:05.930
I'm asking for help.

16:05.932 --> 16:09.000
Now, the board won't allocate
any more promotion money

16:09.002 --> 16:10.635
because of the IPO.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.670
What is this mysterious
board I keep hearing about

16:12.672 --> 16:15.173
every time we're talking about lots
of money? It's a private board.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.908
Some of our trusted advisors,
that kind of thing.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.910
Is Lucious on it?
Of course.

16:18.912 --> 16:19.944
And Uncle Vernon and me.

16:19.946 --> 16:22.146
Okay, I got a solution.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.782
You tell Lucious we all good.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.751
I just need me
a seat on that board.

16:26.753 --> 16:27.785
You're not serious.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.655
No board, no Tiana, no video.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.458
Now, I got to go, Andre.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.327
Make me proud.

Hey, yo, Tiana, this

India?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.061
You my girl.
You ain't supposed to be

23:17.063 --> 23:18.596

23:18.598 --> 23:20.398
So, if it was a dude,
it would've been all right?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.432
I'm not saying that.

23:21.434 --> 23:24.068

RHONDA: Hello? I had another
stroke of inspiration.

23:43.556 --> 23:45.556
PORSHA:
I don't know what's going on.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.191

Cookie's got Jamal in some

23:47.193 --> 23:49.593

23:56.736 --> 23:58.736
Babe, aren't you worried

23:58.738 --> 24:01.038
that Jamal might get hurt? Oh,

24:01.040 --> 24:02.440
They're-They're harmless.
Petty thieves and wannabes.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.375

27:23.342 --> 27:24.975
See, that's how
that sadistic bastard rolls.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.844
He like to play mind games,

27:26.846 --> 27:30.014
and then he kills you.

27:30.016 --> 27:32.416
Yeah, well, Teddy McNally

27:32.418 --> 27:34.752

Yeah, but now everybody's
sitting here, bitching out

28:21.367 --> 28:22.800

28:22.802 --> 28:24.501
Let me talk to Tyree.

28:24.503 --> 28:27.137

28:27.139 --> 28:30.207

Ma, what you mean,
Feds and hit men?

28:33.879 --> 28:35.679
Hold on.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.181
Hello?

28:37.183 --> 28:39.983

28:51.397 --> 28:53.464

29:13.419 --> 29:16.720

All right. Unless you got
more cash to put up.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.798
Man, that's dope.
Let's get them now.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.134
You can't teach and record
at the same time. Man,

29:30.136 --> 29:31.702
forget all that-- yes,
we can. Just get them here

29:31.704 --> 29:33.303
right now and we'll
finish this up.

29:33.305 --> 29:35.939
Hey, come on.
COOKIE:<i> And as a member</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:37.908
of Empire's
board of directors...

29:37.910 --> 29:39.543
LUCIOUS:
Okay, okay, okay, I will handle

29:39.545 --> 29:41.111
Hakeem.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.547
But, Cookie, um...

29:43.549 --> 29:46.817
tell Tiana to have
her girlfriend meet us on set.

29:46.819 --> 29:48.719
Now you're talking.
I'm on it.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.654
Yeah.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.324
Dr. Calhoun.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.393
May I call you Steve?

29:59.898 --> 30:01.398
You have raised

30:01.400 --> 30:04.501
an extraordinary woman
in Anika.

30:04.503 --> 30:07.738
You know, she agreed
to marry me...

30:07.740 --> 30:10.107
knowing that I have ALS.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.742
ALS?

30:11.744 --> 30:14.912
Yeah.

30:14.914 --> 30:18.782
The way you were smiling
every time you played...

30:18.784 --> 30:21.952
all the way to Juilliard.
Mom. Stop.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.521
I know what you're doing, okay?
LUCIOUS:<i> Anika says</i>

30:24.523 --> 30:26.757
that you do research.

30:26.759 --> 30:29.626
Is there anything
on the horizon?

30:29.628 --> 30:31.929
Well, there are clinical trials.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.164
Uh, there's an Israeli company.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.667
At Harvard they're
testing an epilepsy drug.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.303
But there's nothing
that changes the prognosis.

30:39.305 --> 30:41.171
It's not my area,
Lucious,

30:41.173 --> 30:42.339
but I'm gonna reach out.

30:42.341 --> 30:43.974
I'll talk to everyone I know.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.876
I appreciate that.
ANIKA:<i> Why can't you just</i>

30:45.878 --> 30:47.110
be happy for me?

30:47.112 --> 30:49.213
And all the time you came

30:49.215 --> 30:50.480
crying home to me?

30:50.482 --> 30:51.682
All his other women.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.318
Things... have changed now.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.487
You'll see.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.890
DR. CALHOUN: <i> I don't think
it's any</i> <i> secret that I wasn't</i>

30:59.892 --> 31:02.693
in favor of this engagement.
(chuckles)

31:02.695 --> 31:06.029
But I know
my daughter loves you.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.732
I'll do anything I can
for you. Everything I can.

31:09.968 --> 31:11.468
Well,

31:11.470 --> 31:14.905
Steve... there is

31:14.907 --> 31:17.708
this one little thing.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.410
Empire is going public,

31:20.412 --> 31:21.912
but in order for
that to happen,

31:21.914 --> 31:24.147
I need a key man policy,

31:24.149 --> 31:26.183
which means I need
a doctor to certify

31:26.185 --> 31:27.384
that I'm in good health.

31:31.389 --> 31:34.825
You can't be serious. You're
asking me to commit fraud.

31:34.827 --> 31:37.327
Can you please watch your voice, sir?
You're asking me to risk

31:37.329 --> 31:40.731
losing my license, lose
my hospital. That's criminal.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.366
You're just a thug.

31:42.368 --> 31:45.335
Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO
goes through and I die,

31:45.337 --> 31:48.205
Anika will become
a billionaire

31:48.207 --> 31:50.774
in her own right.

31:50.776 --> 31:52.776
But it will not happen

31:52.778 --> 31:54.778
if I can't get...

31:54.780 --> 31:56.847
a key man policy.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.121
Does Anika know
about this?

32:04.123 --> 32:07.858
No, she does not.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.927
I don't want her
ever to know.

32:11.262 --> 32:13.297
You have my word.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.870
Man, Cookie, I've been trying
to get your homegirl number

32:19.872 --> 32:21.238
forever. The one who used to

32:21.240 --> 32:22.973
make the runs for you
back in the day?

32:22.975 --> 32:24.775
That was me, Jermel.

32:24.777 --> 32:27.544
Nah, the cute one--

32:27.546 --> 32:29.379
little light-skinned...
As I was

32:29.381 --> 32:30.881
saying.
Oh, yeah, so

32:30.883 --> 32:32.482
the cat sending them roses--

32:32.484 --> 32:34.284
that's Teddy McNally fo' sho'.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.386
That fool out to lunch
in his head, man.

32:36.388 --> 32:38.488
Heard some stories about
him make you pee your pants.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.158
I need the roses
to stop, Jermel.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.127
Okay. I'm-a get at him for you.

32:44.129 --> 32:45.996
Fo' sho'.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.533
(mouthing)

32:57.842 --> 32:59.576
Well, you know me handling this
for you ain't got nothing

32:59.578 --> 33:01.678
to do with that money.
We family.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.981
Oh, so I can keep
this five grand?

33:08.953 --> 33:12.089
Now, you do know

33:12.091 --> 33:14.691
what I mean
by handle this bastard, right?

33:14.693 --> 33:18.061
I takes care of business.

33:19.130 --> 33:21.999
(drumming rhythmically)

33:23.968 --> 33:25.469
Yo. What's up, man?

33:25.471 --> 33:26.970
Yo, good looking out.
I appreciate it, man.

33:26.972 --> 33:28.338
Yep, yep.
Yo, good looking out.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.439
All right, y'all.
What's up, brother?

33:29.441 --> 33:31.008
What's up?

33:31.010 --> 33:33.343
Um, yo, uh, you, guitar--
you can chill right there.

33:33.345 --> 33:34.878
Keys, you can sit right there.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.713
Um, right now we got
the beats going in the back.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.148
Ladies, I don't know
if I need background vocals

33:38.150 --> 33:39.850
right now, because I...
Uh-uh.

33:39.852 --> 33:40.951
Oh, y'all ain't background?
BOTH: Uh-uh.

33:40.953 --> 33:42.219
It's all good, ladies.
Support.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.621
You know what I'm saying?
I'm here for it.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.057
No way you gonna be able
to manage all these cats.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.959
Son, watch me.

33:48.961 --> 33:52.229
Yo, I need help
with the amps.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.475
Look, it is the measure
of a man

34:05.477 --> 34:07.477
how you come back
from these things, you feel me?

34:07.479 --> 34:09.179
Yeah, but I don't care
what y'all saying.

34:09.181 --> 34:10.580
I'm not working
with that girl.

34:10.582 --> 34:12.349
But you're not listening.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.384
You got to do.

34:23.227 --> 34:24.928
Your pops wants
to talk to you.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.367
Son.

34:30.369 --> 34:31.668
HAKEEM:
Yes.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.236
It was your passion

34:33.238 --> 34:34.838
that inspired us to make
this whole thing happen for you.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.206
I ain't working
with her.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.674
She over there with that girl.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.376
And?

34:39.378 --> 34:41.545
What did you tell me
Jamal is doing right now?

34:41.547 --> 34:43.180
He's in a recording studio.

34:43.182 --> 34:46.016
So, can you afford
to waste any precious time,

34:46.018 --> 34:47.918
especially over a thot.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.520
I ain't gonna let
it get to me.

34:50.522 --> 34:51.922
No, let it get to you.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.623
Get into it.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.093
Let's look at it
from a mathematical perspective.

34:56.095 --> 34:58.028
Your girlfriend
has a girlfriend.

34:58.030 --> 35:00.430
Mm.
Add that up.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.333
Two?
Two girlfriends.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.536
It's a mathematician's dream.

35:06.538 --> 35:08.772
You... It's trigonometry.

35:08.774 --> 35:13.043
And, look, right now,
it's you and me.

35:13.045 --> 35:15.645
You do this for us.

35:21.052 --> 35:25.122
And then you handle that...
like a Lyon.

35:25.124 --> 35:28.091
All right, y'all, time to play.

35:28.093 --> 35:29.659
Come on.

35:29.661 --> 35:32.829
Basically, we just gonna
switch up this beat completely.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.232
Right here. Sorry.

35:35.234 --> 35:36.900
(plays fast, rhythmic beat)

35:36.902 --> 35:38.835
Ta, ta, ta-ta.
You gonna be like...

35:38.837 --> 35:41.304

Check this out.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.145
(clears his throat)

35:48.147 --> 35:50.747

Pa, pa, pa.

35:50.749 --> 35:53.316

39:59.730 --> 40:02.432
Hakeem, you okay?
Why you calling me so late?

40:02.434 --> 40:03.933
Jamal just came over here
snapping,

40:03.935 --> 40:05.835
talking about
somebody shot his studio up.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.937
Was Jamal hurt? Is he okay?

40:07.939 --> 40:09.773
Nah, just one of his engineers
got shot.

40:09.775 --> 40:11.408
(sighs)

40:11.410 --> 40:12.742
Man, I need you
to throw me some quick money

40:12.744 --> 40:14.177
so I can get my video out

40:14.179 --> 40:15.578
before his song drops.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.347
No worries, little brother.
I got it.

40:17.349 --> 40:19.783
I'll make sure it gets done.
