01:53.800 --> 01:54.860
This is

01:54.861 --> 01:55.920
our final edition people,

01:55.960 --> 01:57.880
let's make it sensational!

01:57.920 --> 01:59.360
Um... Sorry...

01:59.400 --> 02:01.320
- you were saying, Mindy?
- Mia.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.660
It's just, I've always been

02:02.661 --> 02:03.960
fascinated with journalism!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.320
Truth, accountability,

02:05.321 --> 02:06.640
objectivity...

02:06.680 --> 02:08.520
plus I can use the extra credit!

02:08.560 --> 02:10.280
Great! Get me an in-depth,

02:10.281 --> 02:12.000
hard-hitting fashion piece

02:12.040 --> 02:14.320
and you'll be famous, Maya.

02:14.360 --> 02:15.780
It's Mia. And I don't know

02:15.781 --> 02:17.200
anything about fashion!

02:17.240 --> 02:18.600
Perfect!

02:18.601 --> 02:19.960
That outsider's viewpoint

02:20.000 --> 02:21.880
- will make you
- all the more objective.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.560
Have fun.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.960
[blows a kiss]

02:46.000 --> 02:48.440
[Mia] Violetta? Um, can we talk?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.960
Sorry, I don't speak dorklish.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.520
Just... hear me out.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.480
Ugh. You're making me look bad!

02:55.520 --> 02:57.360
What do you want?

02:57.400 --> 02:58.520
I'm doing a piece on fashion

02:58.521 --> 02:59.640
for the school paper.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.020
And I thought it would just

03:01.021 --> 03:02.360
make sense to feature you.

03:02.400 --> 03:03.940
Because clearly you're the most

03:03.941 --> 03:05.480
fashionable girl in the school!

03:07.040 --> 03:08.680
- Well, I suppose a girl
- in my position

03:08.720 --> 03:10.620
Does have to set

03:10.621 --> 03:12.520
a certain example to my fans.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.200
And if dealing with...

03:14.240 --> 03:15.780
people like you

03:15.781 --> 03:17.320
is the price of fame,

03:17.360 --> 03:19.200
- then I'll just have
- to grin and bear it.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.280
Cheese!

03:22.640 --> 03:24.160
So, tell me.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.760
- How do you know
- what's fashionable

03:25.800 --> 03:27.320
And what's not?

03:27.360 --> 03:28.440
Walk with me.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.040
Not too close.

03:31.680 --> 03:34.080
- Being stylish is not just about
- what you wear.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.560
It's what you don't wear.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.920
Got an example?

03:38.640 --> 03:39.920
- [camera shutter clicks]
- Me,

03:39.960 --> 03:42.120
I carry cute designer book bags

03:42.160 --> 03:43.300
that are too small

03:43.301 --> 03:44.440
for even one book.

03:44.480 --> 03:45.800
They're always carrying

03:45.801 --> 03:47.120
these giant pieces of luggage.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.680
So last year.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.640
- Uh...
- I think those are instruments.

03:50.680 --> 03:51.880
Yeah.

03:51.920 --> 03:53.320
Instruments of...

03:53.360 --> 03:55.120
unfashionableness.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.120
- Not using that word
- in my article.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.320
[Violetta] Gym rats.

04:01.360 --> 04:03.320
- It's kind of cute
- when boys do it,

04:03.360 --> 04:04.860
But girls and sports

04:04.861 --> 04:06.360
is just gauche.

04:06.400 --> 04:08.680
I mean, sweat pants?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.200
Really?

04:12.040 --> 04:13.440
Go on, take a pic.

04:18.160 --> 04:19.920
So passé.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.279
Definite no-no.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.440
Don't ever do that.

04:24.480 --> 04:25.860
Okay, I think

04:25.861 --> 04:27.240
that's everyone in the school...

04:27.280 --> 04:28.640
Almost.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.980
Hey, I was

04:31.981 --> 04:33.560
just getting ready to leave.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.680
What's... going on?

04:36.720 --> 04:37.920
Voilà.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.400
The epitome of fashion failure.

04:40.440 --> 04:41.460
Paula here

04:41.461 --> 04:42.480
used to have some style,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.280
but as you can see,

04:44.320 --> 04:45.560
the company you keep

04:45.561 --> 04:46.800
can really affect that.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.160
Great, thanks again, see ya!

04:49.200 --> 04:50.800
One for the front page.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.040
What's her problem?

05:04.080 --> 05:05.480
[sighs] Apparently,

05:05.481 --> 05:06.880
everyone in this school.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.800
What a disaster!

05:08.840 --> 05:10.680
No grade is worth this.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.040
Oh, dear.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.460
- Do you need any help?

05:14.461 --> 05:15.840
- Umm...

05:15.880 --> 05:17.340
I think I just need time

05:17.341 --> 05:18.800
to figure this out.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.840
No problem. I'll see you later.

05:20.880 --> 05:21.920
Good luck!

05:31.320 --> 05:33.920
Hi Mia. Say your password.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.280
"To find that

05:35.281 --> 05:36.600
which you hope to save,

05:36.640 --> 05:37.660
fear not the darkness

05:37.661 --> 05:38.680
in the cave."

05:50.440 --> 05:53.680
[screams]

05:53.720 --> 05:55.240
Whoaa!

05:55.960 --> 05:57.320
Whoa!!!!

05:59.360 --> 06:00.520
Wooo!

06:00.560 --> 06:01.840
[laughs]

06:02.680 --> 06:03.880
Whoaaa!

06:05.640 --> 06:07.020
Where is everybody when

06:07.021 --> 06:08.400
I finally do something cool?

06:08.440 --> 06:09.560
[neighing]

06:09.600 --> 06:10.920
[Mia] Hey Onchao!

06:10.960 --> 06:12.320
Want to see what I can do?

06:12.360 --> 06:13.840
[neighs]

06:13.880 --> 06:15.680
Watch this...

06:15.720 --> 06:17.680
Unnghhhhph!

06:17.720 --> 06:18.880
[neighs]

06:23.920 --> 06:25.040
[gasps]

06:27.320 --> 06:28.840
What just happened?

06:28.880 --> 06:30.120
[neighs]

06:30.160 --> 06:32.280
Why is a horse talking to me?

06:32.320 --> 06:33.880
[neighs]

06:33.920 --> 06:35.760
Sorry, a unicorn!

06:35.800 --> 06:36.900
And why can I

06:36.901 --> 06:38.000
understand unicorn?

06:38.040 --> 06:39.920
Oh my gosh! You're a unicorn!

06:39.960 --> 06:41.320
[snorts]

06:41.360 --> 06:44.040
And why am I wearing this dress?

06:44.080 --> 06:45.560
I have wings?

06:45.600 --> 06:46.720
[gasps]

06:46.721 --> 06:47.840
I have wings!

06:47.880 --> 06:49.560
And why do I have wings?

06:55.440 --> 06:57.080
Where am I?

06:58.520 --> 07:00.400
- [Mo] Bull's eye!
- [Mo and Yuko laugh]

07:00.440 --> 07:01.920
- [Mo] Got it!
- [Yuko] That was me!

07:01.960 --> 07:03.040
Wooo!

07:03.080 --> 07:04.120
Hi Mia.

07:04.840 --> 07:05.880
[snorts]

07:06.800 --> 07:08.320
Who's Mia?

07:08.360 --> 07:10.280
So, did you bring the oracle?

07:10.320 --> 07:12.120
- THE WHAT?
- The oracle.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.960
- Did you bring it?
- I'm not sure.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.200
What does it look like.

07:15.240 --> 07:17.280
O... kay. Funny.

07:17.320 --> 07:18.600
Now what is it?

07:18.640 --> 07:19.880
[neighs]

07:19.920 --> 07:21.360
The horse says...

07:21.400 --> 07:22.560
[neighs]

07:22.600 --> 07:24.000
Excuse me,

07:24.040 --> 07:25.040
the unicorn says

07:25.041 --> 07:26.041
I should tell you

07:26.080 --> 07:27.360
that I bumped my head

07:27.361 --> 07:28.640
when I flew in.

07:28.680 --> 07:30.720
Flew? Really?

07:32.160 --> 07:34.200
Wooooa!

07:34.240 --> 07:36.760
Mia, do you know who we are?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.960
I don't even know what you are!

07:40.000 --> 07:42.920
Or, where we are?

07:42.960 --> 07:45.000
- You think she's teasing us?
- No.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.240
I think

07:46.241 --> 07:47.440
she really doesn't remember!

07:47.480 --> 07:48.760
Do you remember

07:48.761 --> 07:50.040
that you come to Centopia

07:50.080 --> 07:51.760
to bring us the oracle

07:51.800 --> 07:53.480
- so we can find
- the Trumptus pieces?

07:53.520 --> 07:56.320
So we can save Centopia?

07:56.360 --> 07:57.760
Who's Centopia,

07:57.761 --> 07:59.160
and why do we need to save him?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.480
Aaaagh!

08:00.520 --> 08:02.840
What? Is Centopia a "her"?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.440
Maybe if you see something

08:04.441 --> 08:06.000
familiar it'll jog your memory.

08:11.480 --> 08:12.520
[Mo] You have to remember

08:12.521 --> 08:13.560
Phuddle.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.720
He kinda sticks in your head.

08:17.320 --> 08:18.400
[gasps]

08:18.440 --> 08:20.640
It's so cute.

08:20.680 --> 08:22.400
- Is it real?
- Uuh?

08:22.440 --> 08:24.060
- Oooh... ooh!

08:24.061 --> 08:25.680
- Ehem... ehem!

08:25.720 --> 08:28.040
What's she talking about?

08:28.080 --> 08:29.440
- I'm real!
- Aaawww

08:29.480 --> 08:31.400
Mia's lost her memory.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.600
Think you can help her?

08:32.640 --> 08:33.919
[giggles]

08:33.960 --> 08:35.120
Maybe.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.280
If she stops tickling me.

08:37.320 --> 08:38.559
[laughs]

08:38.600 --> 08:40.360
Pans don't like to be tickled.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.640
Oh, okay.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.700
- What's a Pan?

08:42.701 --> 08:43.720
- Uh?

08:43.760 --> 08:46.200
I've got my work cut out for me.

08:46.240 --> 08:47.880
Try this.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.120
Anything?

09:00.240 --> 09:03.920
Oh wait, that's for warts.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.440
Okay, thanks anyway, Phuddle.

09:06.480 --> 09:07.520
Th... this is it!

09:07.560 --> 09:08.960
Do this! Eh...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.240
No, never mind.

09:10.280 --> 09:11.800
That's for getting rid of gas.

09:11.840 --> 09:13.160
BUUUURPPP!

09:13.200 --> 09:14.520
And it doesn't work.

09:17.440 --> 09:18.480
Does this

09:18.481 --> 09:19.520
remind you of anything?

09:21.560 --> 09:23.280
Ugh!

09:23.320 --> 09:25.720
Uh, not to touch things?

09:25.760 --> 09:26.880
This is more serious

09:26.881 --> 09:28.000
than we thought.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.240
This, is Centopia.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.440
Every hill, every lake,

09:37.480 --> 09:39.400
every meadow, every tree,

09:39.440 --> 09:41.240
as far as the eye can see...

09:41.280 --> 09:43.400
Does anything look familiar?

09:43.440 --> 09:44.800
Yes. The ground.

09:44.840 --> 09:46.520
I'd like to be on it now.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.980
I can fly down with these wings,

09:47.981 --> 09:49.400
right?

09:49.440 --> 09:51.080
- Mia!
- Mia!

09:51.120 --> 09:53.240
- Uh,
- flying wasn't your best skill

09:53.280 --> 09:55.040
Even when you could remember.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.240
As usual, Mo,

10:04.280 --> 10:05.660
you ignore my rule

10:05.661 --> 10:07.040
never to use the balloon throne.

10:07.080 --> 10:08.240
Are you trying

10:08.241 --> 10:09.400
to get scratches on it?!

10:09.440 --> 10:11.040
Mia's lost her memory.

10:11.080 --> 10:13.360
- We thought
- seeing the island might help.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.480
And, she can't tell us

10:14.481 --> 10:15.560
what the oracle is.

10:15.600 --> 10:17.280
It's in there somewhere.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.976
- We just need some way
- to get it out of her.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.280
I see.

10:20.281 --> 10:21.560
There is a place I know

10:21.600 --> 10:23.880
that may be of some help.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.760
The Cave of Truth.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.720
- It is said that
- inside this cave,

10:27.760 --> 10:29.120
It is impossible

10:29.121 --> 10:30.480
to speak untruth.

10:30.520 --> 10:32.360
You may try to speak a lie,

10:32.400 --> 10:33.560
but the truth

10:33.561 --> 10:34.721
will always come out instead.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.760
And it is said that the truth

10:36.761 --> 10:38.760
can be illuminating.

10:38.800 --> 10:40.120
But if she can't remember

10:40.121 --> 10:41.440
anything in the first place...

10:41.480 --> 10:42.880
Memories are always

10:42.881 --> 10:44.280
the truth. as one remembers it.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.120
- The cave may break
- through whatever

10:46.160 --> 10:47.840
Is obstructing Mia's memories.

10:49.520 --> 10:52.040
It's worth a try. C'mon.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.180
[Phuddle] (PANTING)

10:53.181 --> 10:54.280
I think I have it.

10:54.320 --> 10:55.740
All Mia needs

10:55.741 --> 10:57.160
is a dragon's toenail

10:57.200 --> 10:58.620
- and a hailstorm at night...

10:58.621 --> 11:00.040
- [Yuko] It's okay.

11:00.080 --> 11:01.760
- We're going to
- the Cave of Truth.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.200
[gasps]

11:03.201 --> 11:04.600
The Cave of Truth?!

11:04.640 --> 11:06.640
Are you CRAZY?!

11:06.680 --> 11:08.080
My cousin Tuddle

11:08.081 --> 11:09.480
went to the Cave of Truth.

11:09.520 --> 11:13.680
He was never heard from again.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.240
Which is fine,

11:15.241 --> 11:16.760
because nobody liked him anyway.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.440
But still,

11:18.480 --> 11:20.340
I wouldn't go anywhere

11:20.341 --> 11:22.200
near that place.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.920
Oh! You are, seriously,

11:23.960 --> 11:25.880
the cutest little thing ever!

11:25.920 --> 11:28.640
[laughs]

11:28.680 --> 11:30.160
Awe, shucks!

11:31.920 --> 11:33.300
You want me to fly

11:33.301 --> 11:34.680
with you two, on this horse...

11:34.720 --> 11:35.880
- [neighs]

11:35.881 --> 11:37.040
- Sorry, unicorn...

11:37.080 --> 11:39.280
to find some 'Cave of Truth?

11:39.320 --> 11:40.720
That's about right.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.640
Onchao, let's go!

11:42.680 --> 11:44.520
[Mia] Woooaah!

11:48.560 --> 11:49.900
I'm not sure why,

11:49.901 --> 11:51.240
but I do trust you.

11:51.280 --> 11:52.320
[neighs]

11:59.600 --> 12:02.760
Look! It's a wild unicorn herd!

12:02.800 --> 12:05.320
They're beautiful.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.640
And what are those?

12:07.680 --> 12:08.700
- [Mo] Muncs!

12:08.701 --> 12:09.720
- Hello Muncs!

12:09.760 --> 12:11.760
Mia, they're not our friends!

12:11.800 --> 12:13.600
Onchao, get below to safety!

12:13.640 --> 12:15.560
Yuko let's go!

12:15.600 --> 12:17.200
Don't you guys ever learn!

12:17.240 --> 12:18.680
Hands off the unicorns!

12:31.680 --> 12:32.960
[neighs]

12:33.680 --> 12:35.760
[growls]

12:35.800 --> 12:37.760
- Why are they
- throwing things at me?

12:37.800 --> 12:39.120
What's going on?!

12:39.160 --> 12:41.080
Mia! Use your waterglare!

12:42.720 --> 12:43.880
Like this!

12:47.560 --> 12:48.800
[neighs]

12:51.720 --> 12:53.200
[Yuko] Great shot!

12:53.240 --> 12:54.480
[groans]

12:54.520 --> 12:55.560
[neighs]

12:57.680 --> 12:58.920
Whooooa!

12:58.960 --> 13:01.120
We make a great team, Onchao!

13:04.800 --> 13:06.120
That was fun!

13:06.160 --> 13:07.400
Do we do that a lot?

13:07.440 --> 13:09.280
Way too often.

13:09.320 --> 13:11.576
- Let's get out of here
- before any more of them show up.

13:11.600 --> 13:12.840
[neighs]

13:22.000 --> 13:23.480
[Mia] Is this the place?

13:23.520 --> 13:26.240
One way to find out.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.320
[animalistic sound]

13:27.360 --> 13:28.560
Did you hear that?

13:29.560 --> 13:31.840
Oh, I guess not.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.680
[neighs]

13:36.840 --> 13:39.000
It's okay, I'm scared too.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.360
We'll go together.

13:45.920 --> 13:47.660
I'm scared

13:47.661 --> 13:49.400
and I want to go home.

13:49.440 --> 13:51.760
- Um...
- what I meant to say was, uh...

13:51.800 --> 13:53.320
I'm scared

13:53.321 --> 13:54.840
and I want to go home.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.720
That's not what I meant to say.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.200
I'm going to change the subject

13:58.240 --> 13:59.620
so you girls don't think

13:59.621 --> 14:01.000
I'm a wimp. Ugh!

14:01.040 --> 14:03.600
So, anything pop into your head?

14:03.640 --> 14:06.280
Like the oracle, for instance?

14:06.320 --> 14:09.160
I really like you. A lot!

14:09.200 --> 14:10.240
[gasps]

14:14.800 --> 14:16.020
I sometimes feel like you

14:16.021 --> 14:17.240
just pretend to be helpless

14:17.280 --> 14:19.000
- and girl-y
- to get Mo's attention.

14:19.040 --> 14:20.680
[gasps]

14:20.720 --> 14:21.820
This has got to be

14:21.821 --> 14:22.920
the right place.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.240
Mia, do you remember the oracle?

14:25.280 --> 14:26.840
Just one word.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.040
"Save"?

14:28.080 --> 14:29.280
Does that mean anything?

14:30.800 --> 14:32.480
[neighs]

14:32.520 --> 14:33.760
What do you mean, Onchao?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.160
Something's where?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.600
RAARRGHHHHH!

14:36.640 --> 14:38.080
[neighs]

14:38.120 --> 14:39.576
- I'm worried
- that I run like a girl,

14:39.600 --> 14:41.120
But we should run anyway!

14:41.160 --> 14:42.640
RUN!

14:42.680 --> 14:44.200
[all scream]

14:44.240 --> 14:45.440
[grunts]

14:45.480 --> 14:47.040
- Wooooo!
- Wooooo!

14:48.800 --> 14:50.440
We lost Mia and Onchao.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.280
- We're going to
- have to go back inside.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.800
GrrrrRGGRG...

14:55.840 --> 14:56.860
What do you think

14:56.861 --> 14:57.880
that roaring thing was?

14:57.920 --> 14:59.960
When we find it, you can ask it.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.640
Gee, that boy Mo is cute...

15:03.680 --> 15:04.880
I wish I could be brave

15:04.881 --> 15:06.080
like that girl Yuko...

15:08.000 --> 15:09.960
"Save"..."save".

15:10.000 --> 15:11.220
Why does that word

15:11.221 --> 15:12.440
keep coming into my head?

15:12.480 --> 15:15.960
Uhnnghhh!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.760
Ogh! Ooh...

15:17.800 --> 15:19.240
[neighs]

15:20.000 --> 15:21.040
Oh...

15:22.800 --> 15:24.520
Ou! I remember.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.000
I remember everything!

15:26.040 --> 15:27.880
Onchao, where are Mo and Yuko?

15:28.720 --> 15:30.160
[roaring]

15:31.320 --> 15:32.400
[neighs]

15:32.440 --> 15:34.840
Onchao, come back!

15:34.880 --> 15:37.160
[Mo] She's over here! Come on!

15:37.200 --> 15:38.360
I'm fine.

15:38.361 --> 15:39.520
We've got to help Onchao!

15:39.560 --> 15:41.040
He's running straight

15:41.041 --> 15:42.520
for something loud and scary!

15:42.560 --> 15:45.000
I've got this. You watch Mia.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.280
- She can look after herself!
- I can look after myself!

15:48.760 --> 15:49.800
[neighs]

15:56.120 --> 15:57.680
- Ou!
- Got him!

15:57.720 --> 15:58.900
That was me.

15:58.901 --> 16:00.080
You always shoot too low.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.240
You always

16:01.241 --> 16:02.360
take too much time aiming.

16:02.400 --> 16:04.140
- Guys! I think it's gone!

16:04.141 --> 16:05.880
- Are you okay?

16:05.920 --> 16:07.360
You look cute

16:07.361 --> 16:08.800
when you're scared.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.040
Ugh! I think we should get you

16:11.041 --> 16:13.240
and Onchao out of here.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.640
It's not like

16:14.641 --> 16:16.000
it's my first time in a cave.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.440
Remember the dragon caves?

16:17.480 --> 16:18.880
And the Birth Grotto?

16:18.920 --> 16:20.280
You remember all that?

16:20.320 --> 16:22.080
I do now. I also remember

16:22.120 --> 16:23.740
that I've always thought

16:23.741 --> 16:25.360
Mo's nose was just perfect.

16:25.400 --> 16:27.000
I've always thought that too!

16:32.000 --> 16:33.240
I guess the Cave of Truth

16:33.241 --> 16:34.480
really worked.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.780
With a little help

16:35.781 --> 16:37.040
from another bump on the head.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.240
Do you remember the oracle too?!

16:39.280 --> 16:40.620
"To find that

16:40.621 --> 16:41.960
which you hope to save,

16:42.000 --> 16:43.200
fear not the darkness

16:43.201 --> 16:44.400
in the cave."

16:45.120 --> 16:46.160
[neighs]

16:48.840 --> 16:50.080
Don't you see?

16:50.120 --> 16:51.800
It's in this cave!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.600
Onchao's already sensed it.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.880
[snorts]

16:55.920 --> 16:57.680
That way. But...

16:57.720 --> 16:58.860
the nasty growly thing

16:58.861 --> 17:00.000
went that way.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.359
It's too dark to see anything.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.680
[loud growl]

17:07.720 --> 17:09.480
- But it's very brave of Mo
- to lead us,

17:09.520 --> 17:10.760
Don't you think?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.960
That light!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.520
I keep seeing that light.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.200
Just like my father said!

17:15.240 --> 17:17.200
The truth can be illuminating.

17:17.240 --> 17:19.520
I told Mo he was a lousy shot,

17:19.560 --> 17:21.520
- which is the truth,
- and nothing happened.

17:21.560 --> 17:22.920
That must mean

17:22.921 --> 17:24.280
it isn't really true.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.280
- Saying I've always thought
- he's brave...

17:26.319 --> 17:27.800
That's illuminating.

17:31.520 --> 17:32.860
That's it!

17:32.861 --> 17:34.200
Only the good truths work!

17:34.240 --> 17:35.340
Everybody say something,

17:35.341 --> 17:36.440
but something good!

17:36.480 --> 17:38.040
When I count to three.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.120
One...

17:39.160 --> 17:40.560
[loud growl]

17:40.600 --> 17:41.880
Three!

17:41.920 --> 17:43.560
I'd give my life to protect you!

17:43.600 --> 17:45.416
- I'd give up being Prince
- for either one of you.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.080
I really really like you.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.600
Em... both of you!

17:48.640 --> 17:50.000
And you too, Onchao.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.360
[neighs]

17:54.640 --> 17:55.960
Wha...?

17:59.040 --> 18:00.520
You're the beast?

18:00.560 --> 18:02.960
Guilty as charged.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
And that's the whole cave?!

18:05.040 --> 18:06.480
I thought it was huge!

18:06.520 --> 18:08.000
What was I scared for?!

18:09.000 --> 18:11.080
ROOAAARR!

18:11.120 --> 18:12.600
That's the Trumptus piece.

18:12.640 --> 18:13.780
It sounds scarier

18:13.781 --> 18:14.920
when it's dark.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.040
You tried to scare us away!

18:18.040 --> 18:19.480
I like this place.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.200
All to myself.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.160
Away from the other pans.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.800
You must be Tuddle!

18:24.840 --> 18:26.720
- Phuddle's cousin
- that nobody likes!

18:26.760 --> 18:29.000
That's me. Nobody comes here,

18:29.040 --> 18:30.260
because nobody likes

18:30.261 --> 18:31.480
to hear the truth.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.000
But now you've ruined it for me.

18:34.040 --> 18:36.200
Wait!

18:36.240 --> 18:37.480
If we promise

18:37.481 --> 18:38.720
never to reveal your secret,

18:38.760 --> 18:39.760
would you give us

18:39.761 --> 18:40.761
that horn thing?

18:42.280 --> 18:43.620
And how do I know

18:43.621 --> 18:44.960
you're not lying?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.580
Because, we're standing

18:46.581 --> 18:48.160
in the Cave of Truth!

18:48.200 --> 18:49.560
Good point.

18:50.680 --> 18:53.080
Okay, deal.

18:53.120 --> 18:55.320
The elves thank you Panto!

19:00.200 --> 19:02.120
Wait. Before you go.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.480
Who's cuter?

19:03.520 --> 19:06.320
Me or Phuddle.

19:06.360 --> 19:07.680
[all] Uum...

19:10.880 --> 19:12.600
Uuugh!

19:14.320 --> 19:15.760
That worked out well.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.360
No thanks to Yuko.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.080
- You think
- just because you're a prince

19:19.120 --> 19:20.560
You're always right.

19:20.600 --> 19:22.176
- Neither of you treat me
- like a real elf,

19:22.200 --> 19:24.040
- Just because
- I can't fly so well.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.900
Oh oh! The cave's effect

19:25.901 --> 19:27.720
is still working.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.440
[neighs]

19:29.480 --> 19:31.920
Onchao! I do not do that!

19:31.960 --> 19:33.880
I guess it works on him too.

19:33.920 --> 19:34.940
We said some big things

19:34.941 --> 19:35.960
in there,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.480
to make the light come on.

19:37.520 --> 19:38.640
Does anybody...

19:38.641 --> 19:39.760
regret what they said?

19:39.800 --> 19:40.840
- Nope.

19:40.841 --> 19:41.880
- Meant every word.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.120
Okay then.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.120
But, um... just to be safe,

19:45.160 --> 19:46.260
nobody say another word

19:46.261 --> 19:47.360
until we get home.

20:01.920 --> 20:03.240
I've got it!

20:03.280 --> 20:05.080
I know how to fix Mia!

20:05.120 --> 20:06.160
[neighing]

20:07.640 --> 20:09.560
There you are!

20:09.600 --> 20:11.020
I've got the solution

20:11.021 --> 20:12.440
to your memory problem!

20:12.480 --> 20:13.520
[clears throat]

20:13.560 --> 20:14.800
Prrrrrr!

20:14.840 --> 20:15.960
[clicks tongue]

20:16.000 --> 20:19.560
[sings]

20:20.640 --> 20:23.680
[continues singing]

20:23.720 --> 20:25.200
[coughs]

20:25.240 --> 20:27.000
Are you okay phuddle?

20:27.040 --> 20:28.520
UGH!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.120
Why did you interrupt me...

20:30.160 --> 20:32.640
now I have to start again!

20:32.680 --> 20:37.080
[sings]

20:37.120 --> 20:38.920
- It's okay,
- Phuddle, I can remember.

20:39.760 --> 20:40.920
[gasps]

20:40.960 --> 20:42.120
It worked!

20:42.160 --> 20:45.640
Once again, I am a genius!

20:45.680 --> 20:47.200
Your majesty,

20:47.201 --> 20:48.720
we have something for you!

20:48.760 --> 20:49.880
Well, Mia!

20:49.881 --> 20:51.000
It's good to see you back

20:51.040 --> 20:52.560
to your old self!

20:52.600 --> 20:54.200
Look what we found!

20:57.520 --> 20:58.840
Another piece

20:58.841 --> 21:00.160
of the golden trumptus!

21:02.360 --> 21:03.900
It draws closer to completion

21:03.901 --> 21:05.440
all the time.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.140
So the Cave of Truth

21:07.141 --> 21:08.800
revealed the oracle.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.040
- You've got partridge berries
- in your teeth.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.880
[gasps]

21:12.920 --> 21:15.240
- And you could definitely
- use a haircut... Sire. [gasps]

21:15.280 --> 21:16.920
And, you're awfully stingy

21:16.921 --> 21:18.560
with my allowance. [gasps]

21:18.600 --> 21:20.380
Ah yes, the Cave of Truth.

21:20.381 --> 21:22.160
[laughs]

21:22.200 --> 21:24.520
Its effects can last for days.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.940
I'm going to avoid

21:25.941 --> 21:27.320
more awkwardness by leaving.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.320
See you guys!

21:29.360 --> 21:30.540
- I like her.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.720
- Me too.

21:31.760 --> 21:32.940
- Grrrr...

21:32.941 --> 21:34.120
- I like you too.

21:36.440 --> 21:39.040
Um... I'm going away now.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.520
Me too.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.840
[sighs]

21:53.680 --> 21:55.040
That went well!

21:56.880 --> 21:58.280
So... what do you think?

21:58.320 --> 21:59.800
Great article, Mia!

21:59.840 --> 22:01.160
Yeah, seriously!

22:01.200 --> 22:02.640
I think people will love it.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.520
- Thought you might
- want an advanced copy.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.140
That's such a relief

22:10.141 --> 22:11.160
that you guys like it!

22:11.200 --> 22:12.340
I just hope

22:12.341 --> 22:13.480
they get my name right...

22:13.520 --> 22:14.560
[Violetta gasps]

22:16.840 --> 22:18.960
What is the meaning of this?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.480
"Many Factions, Many Fashions:

22:21.520 --> 22:22.820
Individual Style at the

22:22.821 --> 22:24.120
International Boarding School."

22:24.160 --> 22:25.560
This is not what I taught you!

22:25.600 --> 22:27.200
Sure it is. You taught me

22:27.240 --> 22:28.816
- that everyone
- has their own unique style

22:28.840 --> 22:30.320
- And they
- shouldn't be intimidated

22:30.360 --> 22:31.816
- By a self-appointed
- fashion queen.

22:31.840 --> 22:32.980
Because we're all great

22:32.981 --> 22:34.120
in our own way.

22:34.160 --> 22:35.340
That is the most disgusting

22:35.341 --> 22:36.520
thing I've ever heard.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.200
Maybe. But hey,

22:38.240 --> 22:39.736
- at least that picture of you
- came out well.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.360
These are just my shoes!

22:41.400 --> 22:42.400
And you put me

22:42.401 --> 22:43.401
between the band geeks

22:43.440 --> 22:44.920
and the science nerds?

22:44.960 --> 22:46.240
Argh!

22:46.280 --> 22:47.280
[all laugh]

22:48.305 --> 22:54.853
