00:00.000 --> 00:01.500
(tense music)

00:01.600 --> 00:03.540
- To hell with being a producer.

00:03.640 --> 00:04.940
You're the suitress.

00:05.040 --> 00:05.860
- Let's put some money on it.

00:05.960 --> 00:08.600
You lock down one of these all-stars,
I'll give you my producer bonus.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.180
- [Jay] He full-on
frat-boy dated raped her.

00:11.280 --> 00:12.020
- If you leave now,

00:12.120 --> 00:13.900
everyone's gonna think that we were lying.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.860
Take a sip, drink, and have a good time.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.380
The person who is really
taken with you is Noelle.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.220
- Really?
- Make a move.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.740
You need to expose him
for who he really is.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.340
Come on, Maya.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.180
- [Roger] It's okay.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.860
(woman shouting)
Oh my god!

00:27.960 --> 00:30.340
(blow thudding)
(Roger screams)

00:30.440 --> 00:31.500
- Go to the network.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.380
You can root out this
cancer once and for all.

00:34.480 --> 00:36.580
- Rachel Goldberg made it happen.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.260
- You have completely lost control.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.220
- Oh, this is on me?

00:39.320 --> 00:40.660
- You're damn right it is.

00:40.760 --> 00:41.580
- I'm pregnant.

00:41.680 --> 00:43.780
- It always should have been this way.

00:43.880 --> 00:44.580
(camera shutter clicks)

00:44.680 --> 00:46.300
- We're doing Stripper Queens scripted.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.740
I want out.
- Lock her up!

00:47.840 --> 00:50.700
Lock her up, lock her up!
- This is all because of you.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.980
(Rachel retches)

00:53.080 --> 00:54.300
- You wanna get outta here

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400
and scout locations for the finale?

00:57.840 --> 01:00.500

02:49.160 --> 02:50.500
- Who'd have thought I'd end up here?

02:50.600 --> 02:52.180
- Yeah.

02:52.280 --> 02:55.040
- Not busing tables or wreckin' cars.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.700
- I could not imagine you
settling for that life.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.780
- I didn't really think I
had a choice growin' up.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.860
- Oh yeah, now all the
Castellis brag about their son,

03:03.960 --> 03:08.020
the big fancy TV producer.
(Tommy laughs)

03:08.120 --> 03:10.100
- Yeah, well, dad's favourite pastime

03:10.200 --> 03:12.620
was calling me a worthless
piece of garbage,

03:12.720 --> 03:14.540
when he wasn't kicking the shit out of me,

03:14.640 --> 03:16.820
so probably not.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.920
- You showed him.

03:19.840 --> 03:20.620
Good for you.

03:20.720 --> 03:22.800
- Yeah, not so good for my little brother.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.640
I had to leave him behind
to fend for himself, so.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.500
- I get that kind of regret.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.460
Trust me.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.580
You know, but the past happened.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.540
You did what you did.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.640
You made the choices you made.

03:40.800 --> 03:41.740
All you have now is what's ahead.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.840
That's all there is.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.300
- I'd say that was looking
pretty good right now.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.140
(Rachel laughs)

03:47.240 --> 03:50.000
(poignant music)

03:52.680 --> 03:54.680
I think we should drink to think.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.160
(uneasy music)

04:13.040 --> 04:15.620
(music darkens)

04:15.720 --> 04:18.320
(music swells)

04:37.400 --> 04:40.400
(door rattles open)

04:41.280 --> 04:42.860
- How is she?

04:42.960 --> 04:46.780
(scoffs) So we go balls
out to take Rachel down

04:46.880 --> 04:50.260
and she survives, of course,
like a sociopathic cockroach

04:50.360 --> 04:52.100
in a nuclear holocaust,
and now we just, what?

04:52.200 --> 04:55.020
- I am figuring it out, Jay.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.980
Okay, you should be thinking
about Passport to Dance.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.340
Last night's numbers are in,

04:59.440 --> 05:03.700
and we went from dead in
the water to on the bubble.

05:03.800 --> 05:04.660
All right.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.540
Thank god Alexi is charming again.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.660
I mean, he really milked that
cane for all it was worth.

05:08.760 --> 05:09.620
- Yeah, that's wonderful, Quinn.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.740
That's great, but right
now, I wanna help that girl.

05:11.840 --> 05:13.140
- Yeah, me too.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.420
- T minus 24 hours until Stripper Queens.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.740
I'm gettin' that pre-pitch half-loaf.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.100
- (groans) Gross, Chet.
- You know,

05:19.200 --> 05:21.300
hey, this is the first
time we're doing scripted.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.820
There's a lot of excitement
and anticipation.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.340
- Yeah, well, I could do--
- She's here.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.960
(tense music)

05:32.560 --> 05:35.780
- Oh, showing up for work, how novel.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.300
- It was a long weekend,
and we were scouting.

05:38.400 --> 05:39.140
For work.

05:39.240 --> 05:39.980
- Right.

05:40.080 --> 05:42.300
Well, I hope you practised safe scouting.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.340
- Oh my god, do you have a point,

05:43.440 --> 05:45.520
other than being creepily up my asshole?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.460
- There's something wrong with Noelle.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.300
- What do you mean?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.820
- Well, she's not eating, sleeping,

05:50.920 --> 05:53.460
or maintaining basic personal hygiene.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.060
So I'm thinking about
bringing in a therapist.

05:56.160 --> 05:59.040
- Right, because therapy
always works out so well.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.020
This is normal, okay.

06:01.120 --> 06:02.500
She doesn't need anyone holding her hand,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.260
telling her how to get through it.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.860
You figure it out, you
focus on what's ahead.

06:06.960 --> 06:08.500
Speaking of which, do you wanna know

06:08.600 --> 06:10.600
what we have planned for today or what?

06:12.120 --> 06:14.980
- Okay, so it's called Don't Get Bombed.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.740
It's the perfect combo
of physical and mental.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.420
Our guys are gonna have
to bring their A games.

06:19.520 --> 06:20.460
- Congratulations.

06:20.560 --> 06:23.300
You managed to squeeze
three sports cliches

06:23.400 --> 06:24.500
into one statement.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.260
You care to talk about how
to protect our final four?

06:27.360 --> 06:28.980
Candi, August, Noelle, Rodrigo?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.140
- Well, I was actually thinking
of switching it up a bit.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.980
Sounds like Noelle's
kind of a dud these days.

06:33.080 --> 06:34.740
- Yeah, I can't imagine what
could have gotten into her.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.780
- So that's your plan?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.540
Just throw her out like trash?

06:37.640 --> 06:40.500
- Well, that's what you
do when things get stale.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.980
Besides, I mean, we have to top
last week's ratings bonanza.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.680
I mean, you do remember the
episode that we created.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.420
- (chuckles) Well, I mean,

06:51.520 --> 06:54.100
whatever couple as to go up
against August and Candi,

06:54.200 --> 06:56.620
they will need to bring
a shit-load of chemistry

06:56.720 --> 07:00.260
to rival those two jackrabbits.

07:00.360 --> 07:03.660
They haven't left their room
for three days straight.

07:03.760 --> 07:06.380
So glad I don't have to clean
the sheets in this place.

07:06.480 --> 07:07.460
- What?

07:07.560 --> 07:12.060
- Oh, and here I thought
you knew everything.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.300
I guess you miss a thing or two

07:13.400 --> 07:15.740
when you disappear for a long weekend.

07:15.840 --> 07:19.820
Go on, scurry off and produce
your challenge, coach.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.260
Go team, go!

07:21.360 --> 07:23.840
(tense music)

07:38.640 --> 07:39.580
- Hey.

07:39.680 --> 07:42.900
- I guess you and August
weren't exclusive.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.780
- Right, yeah.

07:44.880 --> 07:47.300
- So, how about we get rid of
him at the challenge today?

07:47.400 --> 07:49.180
- No, come on.

07:49.280 --> 07:51.640
What, no, Jack's not final four material.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.140
- What, I thought you'd be glad

07:55.240 --> 07:57.340
to be done with August once and for all.

07:57.440 --> 07:59.860
There's no reason to keep him around.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.960
Is there?

08:03.160 --> 08:05.740
- I don't know, time's
running out on our bet.

08:05.840 --> 08:08.480
I mean, you're always telling
me to keep my options open.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.560
Well, stripper seconds doesn't
sound like much of an option.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.740
But hey, sure.

08:15.840 --> 08:18.360
Why not see if you crazy
kids can make it work?

08:19.240 --> 08:22.820
(unsettling music)

08:22.920 --> 08:25.240
- [Noelle] Quinn, what are you doing?

08:26.160 --> 08:29.940
- I want to talk about
what Rachel did to you.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.820
- What, screw my boyfriend
and then push me onto Roger

08:32.920 --> 08:34.340
so I'd stay out of her way?

08:34.440 --> 08:35.420
No, I'm good.

08:35.520 --> 08:39.340
- No, I'm talking about what else she did.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.260
- Oh my god.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.620
Okay, what line are you
gonna give me this time?

08:43.720 --> 08:44.660
Hmm?

08:44.760 --> 08:47.720
Noelle, this dance
challenge, it's for you.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.680
Noelle, you should play hard-to-get.

08:52.640 --> 08:56.780
Noelle, you're looking a
little desperate and stuck-up.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.860
Why not get wasted with the date rapist,

08:58.960 --> 09:02.540
and then lie to protect him
so you really feel like scum?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.100
- Okay.

09:04.200 --> 09:05.100
Come on.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.180
Noelle, you are a fighter.

09:08.280 --> 09:09.540
Stop moping around

09:09.640 --> 09:13.520
like some heroin-addicted
sweatpants model and fight.

09:15.640 --> 09:18.500
You know, sometimes you have huge,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.200
life-altering events thrown at you.

09:23.360 --> 09:25.360
You can't go back to who you were.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.700
You have to figure out who you are now.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.800
Let me help you, Noelle.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.340
Rachel needs to pay for what she did.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.920
(tense music)

09:38.040 --> 09:40.480
- Get the hell outta my room.

09:50.640 --> 09:55.140
- I don't know if you've
figured this out yet or not,

09:55.240 --> 09:58.600
but Rachel's a contestant
playing her own game.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.180
And all of you

10:02.280 --> 10:04.280
are just collateral damage.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.760
(music swells)

10:13.040 --> 10:16.500
(unsettling music)

10:16.600 --> 10:19.460
(faint chattering)

10:19.560 --> 10:21.420
(muffled speaking)
- I've never--

10:21.520 --> 10:22.980
- Something worth
leaving (speaks faintly).

10:23.080 --> 10:23.780
- I could try doing that.
- Oh.

10:23.880 --> 10:24.740
- I've never done that before.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.340
- Hey, you guys.
- Well, it doesn't look--

10:26.440 --> 10:29.420
- Hey, I just came to prep
this one for today's challenge.

10:29.520 --> 10:30.780
And you know, I think
Jay's waiting for you

10:30.880 --> 10:31.860
by crafty, Candi.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.580
- Oh, okay, perfect.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.840
Yeah, I'm kinda hungry from
all the sex that we just had.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.560
Mm, see ya.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
- I don't think I need any producing.

10:48.560 --> 10:49.380
Thanks, anyway.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.980
- Hey, listen, I get it, okay.

10:51.080 --> 10:52.460
You're with Candi now.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.340
I'm pulling for you to go all
the way with a million bucks.

10:54.440 --> 10:55.420
- (laughs) Really?

10:55.520 --> 10:56.260
- Yeah.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.100
- That's nice, I mean, just
like you're hopin' Jack wins

10:59.200 --> 11:00.940
so you two can run away together?

11:01.040 --> 11:02.860
- What?

11:02.960 --> 11:04.380
Oh my god, did he tell you that?

11:04.480 --> 11:06.060
- Why, are you callin' him a liar?

11:06.160 --> 11:07.820
- I'm just saying, the
guy's kind of delusional.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.580
He's been, like, weirdly obsessed with me.

11:09.680 --> 11:10.820
- Oh, come on.
- I mean, I actually feel,

11:10.920 --> 11:11.780
like, bad for him.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.020
It feels like he's having some sort of,

11:13.120 --> 11:14.300
like, psychotic break.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.140
- He seems fine to me.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.860
- Well.

11:17.960 --> 11:18.660
Yeah, he is.

11:18.760 --> 11:19.860
I mean, like, he's a great guy.

11:19.960 --> 11:21.580
I just feel bad that you got this idea.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.420
Because I've just been,
you know, all about you.

11:25.520 --> 11:27.520
I thought I made that perfectly clear.

11:29.920 --> 11:30.660
- Rachel, I--

11:30.760 --> 11:32.760
- It's fine.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.380
Good luck tonight.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.960
(tense music)

11:45.400 --> 11:46.260
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.420
- Whoa.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.380
Jacko Station Micro Brew?

11:49.480 --> 11:51.940
Tommy, where the hell
did you get that, mate?

11:52.040 --> 11:54.140
- A friend from Melbourne
turned me on to it.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.500
I know, I know, beer on the
job spells drinking problem.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.340
But my near-perfect weekend

11:59.440 --> 12:01.900
just turned into a
perfectly shit Monday, so.

12:02.000 --> 12:05.340
- Hey, you know what, I'll drink to that.

12:05.440 --> 12:06.460
- You sure?

12:06.560 --> 12:07.820
You got the challenge in a couple hours.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.940
- Yeah, and I could stand to (chuckles)

12:11.040 --> 12:13.380
clear my head a bit, to be honest.

12:13.480 --> 12:14.740
Yep.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.840
- All right.
- Right.

12:18.000 --> 12:18.740
- Come on.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.260
(can top pops)
- Cheers.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.580
- I mean, I probably should
have gone to the cops

12:21.680 --> 12:23.660
like you told me to, but Rachel

12:23.760 --> 12:24.480
just got in my head and--
- No, hey,

12:24.560 --> 12:25.900
none of this is on you.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.300
It's not your fault.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.900
- But Rachel--
- Is awful, Noelle.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.540
She is a horrible human being.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.260
And I did everything that
I could to stop her, but--

12:33.360 --> 12:35.300
- Hi guys.

12:35.400 --> 12:37.340
You trying to steal my producer, Noelle?

12:37.440 --> 12:39.440
Jay's taking me all the way.

12:40.600 --> 12:42.540
- Good for you.

12:42.640 --> 12:44.260
- Noelle, I--

12:44.360 --> 12:47.280
- Oh, she looks so sad.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.500
- Okay, we gotta roll, people.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.260
Where are the rest of my contestants?

12:51.360 --> 12:52.500
Where are my other contestants?

12:52.600 --> 12:53.420
(faint chattering on radio)

12:53.520 --> 12:54.520
- I can't believe they
moved up the challenge time.

12:54.600 --> 12:55.820
- No, hey, it's all right, mate.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.340
Hey, hey, can you take that for a second?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.140
- You gonna okay?

12:59.240 --> 13:00.660
Should I get you some coffee or somethin'?

13:00.760 --> 13:02.540
- No, I'm good, I'm good, positive.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.340
- Hey.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.260
- I'm so glad you're back.

13:05.360 --> 13:06.100
- Yeah, me too.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.340
Yeah, look, sorry I'm MIA.

13:07.440 --> 13:09.660
But this challenge is, like, super simple.

13:09.760 --> 13:11.100
Okay, it's just trivia questions

13:11.200 --> 13:12.820
about things the women have told you,

13:12.920 --> 13:15.140
just to see if you've
been paying attention.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.820
But you already know that
Sofia's favourite colour is green

13:17.920 --> 13:19.580
and that Candi's son is 13.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.680
You know, it's that kind of stuff.

13:22.720 --> 13:24.460
- I'm gonna win this one for you.

13:24.560 --> 13:25.660
- One minute, people, move it.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.760
- [Man] Okay, we're going.

13:28.120 --> 13:29.900
- Look, I'm really sorry.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.060
I mean, I'm such a chicken,
and you're such a nice guy.

13:32.160 --> 13:34.900
But I just don't like you like that.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.940
- (chuckles) You slept with me.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.580
- Look, there's no easy
way to tell someone

13:40.680 --> 13:42.340
that they're just a pity lay.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.340
- No.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.300
No, that's not true.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.580
- Okay, let me put it to you this way.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.900
You weren't even the last
guy I screwed that night.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
- [Dan] Come on, people, it's showtime.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.300
You ready?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.140
Gimme that.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.780
- Well, I'm not sure that
Jack's in the right head space

13:58.880 --> 14:00.660
for this challenge right now.

14:00.760 --> 14:01.700
Too bad.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.420
- And I'm not sure it was
a great idea for August

14:04.520 --> 14:07.700
to slam five beers before
the challenge either.

14:07.800 --> 14:08.500
- He can handle it.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.020
- [Dan] Okay, and action, Graham.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.500
(romantic music)

14:12.600 --> 14:14.600
- We

14:15.520 --> 14:16.900
are men.

14:17.000 --> 14:20.620
And as men, we have faced
challenges of strength,

14:20.720 --> 14:22.720
wits, and ingenuity.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.580
But women across the ages
have placed the highest value

14:26.680 --> 14:28.820
on another skill: listening.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.340
Or at least I think that's what they said.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.860
I just remember blah, blah, blah.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.260
And to prove to you ladies that listening

14:34.360 --> 14:36.900
is a matter of life and death...

14:37.000 --> 14:39.820
(mysterious music)

14:39.920 --> 14:41.820
(August laughs)

14:41.920 --> 14:45.900
Gentlemen, you will need
to diffuse your bombs

14:46.000 --> 14:47.260
before the time runs out.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.860
You will run over to the stations.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.460
Ladies, please say hi.

14:50.560 --> 14:51.340
- Hello.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.260
- Hello.
- Hi.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.500
- A correct answer to their questions

14:54.600 --> 14:57.100
will make one of the wires darken,

14:57.200 --> 15:00.100
bringing you one step closer
to cutting the right wire.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.860
Wrong answer to the
question, and gentlemen,

15:01.960 --> 15:04.620
you will be forced to
take a shot of tequila,

15:04.720 --> 15:08.180
making this game
progressively more explosive.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.460
- Harder to remember

15:09.560 --> 15:10.320
what anyone said.
- That's new.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.660
- Oh, yeah, did I forget to mention that?

15:12.760 --> 15:13.620
Probably not a great idea

15:13.720 --> 15:15.340
to start three sheets to the wind already.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.380
- Nice, Graham.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.780
Well, if it's a drinking game,

15:17.880 --> 15:20.180
the Aussie's definitely got the
upper hand, boys, I'm sorry.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.020
- Men, grab your bombs.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.700
I hope you've listened well.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.140
And don't get bombed.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.500
(tense music)
(buzzer buzzing)

15:28.600 --> 15:30.100
- Oh, good one, brother.

15:30.200 --> 15:32.500
- [Computerised Voice] Bombs activated.

15:32.600 --> 15:34.580
(suspenseful music)

15:34.680 --> 15:37.440
(music quickens)

15:38.360 --> 15:39.980
- Okay, how old is my son?

15:40.080 --> 15:42.820
Is he eight, or is he 13?

15:42.920 --> 15:43.660
- 13.
(buzzer buzzes)

15:43.760 --> 15:45.700
- Okay, no, I'm not that old.

15:45.800 --> 15:46.980
Okay, drink up.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.980
- What was my high school
mascot, a lion or a tiger?

15:51.080 --> 15:55.100
- (growls) A tiger.
(bell dings)

15:55.200 --> 15:56.260
- Favourite record.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.700
- Poet, no, no, no, no.
(buzzer buzzes)

15:57.800 --> 15:59.260
- Favourite place to travel.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.100
- Banks.
(buzzer buzzes)

16:00.200 --> 16:01.420
- Trojan.
(buzzer buzzes)

16:01.520 --> 16:02.780
- Two wheels.
(bell dings)

16:02.880 --> 16:03.620
(buzzer buzzes)

16:03.720 --> 16:05.260
- What is my religion?

16:05.360 --> 16:06.100
- Catholic.

16:06.200 --> 16:06.940
(bell dings)
- Yes. (laughs)

16:07.040 --> 16:09.040
- Yeah?
- Yes.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.820
- Ah, I win!

16:11.920 --> 16:12.700
I win!

16:12.800 --> 16:14.900
- Indeed, Rodrigo's the winner.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.460
You know, Rodrigo, your
English is not so bueno,

16:17.560 --> 16:20.020
but your hearing is da bomb.

16:20.120 --> 16:21.180
Now, America,

16:21.280 --> 16:22.260
high five, right up top.
- Put 'em there.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.980
- It now August and Jack

16:24.080 --> 16:25.660
to see who is gonna go home tonight.

16:25.760 --> 16:27.700
Under two minutes, you guys.

16:27.800 --> 16:29.260
(suspenseful music)
- Hmm.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.980
- What's my favourite
colour, blue or green?

16:33.080 --> 16:37.580
- (laughs) I'm not falling for this again.

16:37.680 --> 16:38.500
Blue.
(buzzer buzzes)

16:38.600 --> 16:40.380
- Actually, it's green.

16:40.480 --> 16:42.060
- Okay, that's it.

16:42.160 --> 16:42.900
I'm done.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.660
Stop the tape, that's it.
- Okay, but Jack, look,

16:44.760 --> 16:46.540
we can't, the clock is
still ticking, and you need

16:46.640 --> 16:47.900
to cut the right wire.
- That's it, I'm done.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.900
- All right, just--
- I don't care.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.460
I want the those place the blow up.

16:50.560 --> 16:51.860
- I get that.
(electronic beeping)

16:51.960 --> 16:52.820
(explosion echoing)
- Whoa.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.700
- Hey.
- Whoa.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.820
- Game over.
- Oh my god.

16:54.920 --> 16:55.740
(buzzer buzzing)

16:55.840 --> 16:57.620
- Everlasting?

16:57.720 --> 16:59.100
More like Ever-nothing.

16:59.200 --> 16:59.960
(metallic crashing)
(woman laughing)

17:00.040 --> 17:03.220
All the women here are nothing

17:03.320 --> 17:05.700
but good-for-nothing liars.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.540
- And another satisfied Goldberg consumer.

17:08.640 --> 17:10.960
- I thought you lived
for this kind of stuff.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
- I used to.

17:14.680 --> 17:16.340
- Rachel. (chuckles)

17:16.440 --> 17:18.420
Rachel, you are the--
(body thudding)

17:18.520 --> 17:19.900
- (laughs) That is sick.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.980
- [August] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:23.080 --> 17:23.920
- [Graham] Well, it looks like Jack

17:24.000 --> 17:24.740
is going home tonight.
- Why?

17:24.840 --> 17:25.700
- [August] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.780
- Why me?

17:26.880 --> 17:28.780
What did I ever do to anybody?

17:28.880 --> 17:30.880
Try to be nice?

17:31.200 --> 17:33.600
- It seems like August is sticking around.

17:35.560 --> 17:36.260
Your move.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.460
(tense music)

17:38.560 --> 17:41.040
(Tommy sighs)

17:44.800 --> 17:46.340
- I'm in.

17:46.440 --> 17:51.220
Tell me what she did and
what we're gonna do about it.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.880
(music swells)

17:58.160 --> 17:59.900
- The stakes could not be higher

18:00.000 --> 18:01.380
for each of you three ladies.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.380
Now, soon we're gonna be heading

18:02.480 --> 18:03.860
to a beautiful mountain resort,

18:03.960 --> 18:06.460
where you will have a chance
to make your case to these men

18:06.560 --> 18:09.180
in a romantic and intimate setting.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.940
But you will also be given
an unprecedented chance

18:12.040 --> 18:14.780
to shoot and edit your own short video

18:14.880 --> 18:16.980
that you will present to
August, Rodrigo, and America

18:17.080 --> 18:19.580
tonight at the elimination ceremony

18:19.680 --> 18:22.220
with no interference

18:22.320 --> 18:25.300
from any of out producers and/or editors.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.040
You get to tell your story.

18:29.600 --> 18:30.940
- No one's gonna help them edit?

18:31.040 --> 18:33.420
These videos are gonna
be like home movies.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.260
- They are going to look real and honest.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.300
People love that shit.

18:37.400 --> 18:38.980
- Dude, it sounds soft as hell.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.100
- Look, I know that you're trying

18:40.200 --> 18:41.540
to get Noelle dumped tonight, all right.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.140
But she has earned a chance
to showcase her true self.

18:44.240 --> 18:44.980
- Really?

18:45.080 --> 18:45.780
Oh, great, so what?

18:45.880 --> 18:47.900
Her video's gonna be some
existential suicide note

18:48.000 --> 18:49.140
titled Mopey Buzzkill?

18:49.240 --> 18:50.620
- Wow. (scoffs)

18:50.720 --> 18:53.300
You know, look, you and
I both know that Sofia

18:53.400 --> 18:55.180
isn't in the same league as Noelle.

18:55.280 --> 18:57.780
But I guess it's easier
to sacrifice a star

18:57.880 --> 18:59.580
than face your own guilt.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.200
(tense music)

19:04.360 --> 19:06.140
- You literally can't even
look Noelle in the eyes.

19:06.240 --> 19:07.740
Of course you're tryin' to get her cut.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.140
- Frankly, you should be helping me.

19:09.240 --> 19:09.940
(Jay groans)

19:10.040 --> 19:13.500
No, if Noelle gets cut, you
have two girls in the finale.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.340
I mean, that's a guaranteed
win for the first time ever.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.740
That would be a huge bonus.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.680
- Yeah, because that's exactly
what I'm focused on right now, Rachel.

19:21.960 --> 19:23.960
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:26.320 --> 19:28.900
We should probably keep it profesh.

19:29.000 --> 19:31.260
It killed me that you
had to work this weekend.

19:31.360 --> 19:34.640
I thought about you constantly,
like, when I was alone.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.900
- Well, I got you something.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.580
- Look, Noelle shouldn't even
be here in the first place.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.700
I mean, getting cut, going home,

19:42.800 --> 19:43.940
that would be the best thing for her.

19:44.040 --> 19:46.300
She could get therapy or whatever.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.060
I mean, you could help her.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.160
Just think about it?

19:52.440 --> 19:53.900
- [Tommy] I got you something.

19:54.000 --> 19:57.640
- Oh my god, you are
the best boyfriend ever.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.580
- Sorry, sorry, it's just so hard

20:03.680 --> 20:05.680
to keep it profesh with you.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.560
See you tonight?

20:11.040 --> 20:12.300
- Scouting trip?

20:12.400 --> 20:13.140
I know what you're up to.

20:13.240 --> 20:13.940
I know your tricks.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.260
Just stay away from my man.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.140
- Oh my god, you're not
a contestant, Madison.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.940
Bring the drama down a notch.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.040
- Whoa, what's up with your hair?

20:22.840 --> 20:24.460
You're, like, shedding.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.940
That's so gross.

20:26.040 --> 20:29.100
- You know, I have an
actual, stressful, real job.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.740
How about you try working
a day in your life

20:30.840 --> 20:32.220
instead of whoring yourself up the ladder

20:32.320 --> 20:33.740
and you'd have a clue.

20:33.840 --> 20:36.780
(unsettling music)

20:36.880 --> 20:39.700
- Well, now.
- Wow.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.780
Hello, I haven't seen
you since I got back.

20:41.880 --> 20:42.700
- Did you like

20:42.800 --> 20:43.780
how I win the challenge?
- Mm-hmm.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.300
- I win it for you, bellissima.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.740
- What about Noelle?

20:46.840 --> 20:49.020
- Well, I've barely seen her this week.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.100
But I'll pick her tonight,

20:50.200 --> 20:51.700
because this is what America wants.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.620
- I'm not so sure what
America wants anymore,

20:53.720 --> 20:54.540
to be honest with you.

20:54.640 --> 20:57.140
You two haven't had any
real heat in a long time.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.260
You should try spicing things up with her.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.540
You know, showing you still
have that passion there.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.940
I mean, I'll be dying of
jealousy on the inside,

21:05.040 --> 21:07.040
but I really think you should go for it.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.700
(door slams)

21:11.800 --> 21:12.940
(energetic music)

21:13.040 --> 21:14.300
♪ But you know I'm the man ♪

21:14.400 --> 21:15.900
♪ Who can make 'em all night ♪

21:16.000 --> 21:17.660
- This is great.

21:17.760 --> 21:18.660
Who shot this?

21:18.760 --> 21:21.300
- This indie filmmaker
who owes me a favour.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.580
- Quinn, I need your eyes on this.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.580
- Yeah, I will be right there, all right.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.340
- You know--
- Okay, yes.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.300
- We don't have to do this pitch today.

21:28.400 --> 21:29.660
You've got a lot on your plate.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.760
- Yes, we do.

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
I do.

21:35.800 --> 21:37.780
(Quinn sighs)

21:37.880 --> 21:41.060
I just, I can't stay here
if she's gonna be like this.

21:41.160 --> 21:42.100
I just can't.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.680
(tense music)

21:48.240 --> 21:49.100
(door slams)

21:49.200 --> 21:51.140
- Whoa, Quinn.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.380
- I know, and I am sorry for
your young, innocent eyes,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.480
but it is important.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.080
- You sure about this?

22:00.120 --> 22:00.860
- Very.

22:00.960 --> 22:04.020
(music swells)

22:04.120 --> 22:07.020
(lighthearted music)

22:07.120 --> 22:09.280
- Ladies, here we are

22:10.160 --> 22:12.160
on a beautiful mountaintop.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.700
I can't imagine anything more romantic.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.500
August and Rodrigo are in
separate rooms waiting, alone.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.100
Which means that each of
you will have seven minutes

22:21.200 --> 22:23.260
in heaven to connect with
each one of them on-on-one.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.380
This could potentially be
your last time together.

22:25.480 --> 22:28.940
Because tonight, one of
you will be going home.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.300
- It looks great.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.380
I guess scouting was worth it.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.040
- Yeah, I guess it wasn't
a complete waste of time.

22:36.200 --> 22:36.940
- August.
- Yeah.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.800
- If this could be my last
night with you, I just have to,

22:41.360 --> 22:42.740
you are this stand-up, great guy.

22:42.840 --> 22:44.700
You have been since day one.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.420
I always made fun of people
who bought into this nonsense.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.020
And I don't know, maybe it's
the stupid show talking,

22:50.120 --> 22:52.120
but

22:53.200 --> 22:55.200
I think that I'm falling for you.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.880
Like, for real, so.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.300
Oh my god, oh god.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.780
That sounds, like, so crazy.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.940
- No, hey, hey, no, it's not.

23:07.040 --> 23:08.380
It's not crazy.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.480
We've had a great time together.

23:11.680 --> 23:14.580
And I really do, I think you're amazing.

23:14.680 --> 23:15.420
(Candi laughs)

23:15.520 --> 23:17.220
You are a breath of fresh air.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.340
- Wow, Candi's goin' after him hard.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.780
I hope you don't have a problem with that.

23:22.880 --> 23:25.300
- Trust me, a woman telling
August she has feelings for him

23:25.400 --> 23:27.380
is the surest way to turn him off.

23:27.480 --> 23:28.940
- And nobody's bitter.

23:29.040 --> 23:29.800
- Wait, hold up, are you
tryin' to get rid of Candi now?

23:29.880 --> 23:31.940
Because that was not our deal.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.340
- Dude, don't worry about it, okay.

23:34.440 --> 23:35.820
I have plans for Candi.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.660
(man moaning)
(heavy breathing)

23:38.760 --> 23:40.100
- Oh my god, what is he doing?

23:40.200 --> 23:41.540
- Come on.

23:41.640 --> 23:43.380
There used to be such a heat between us,

23:43.480 --> 23:45.460
such a passion, huh.

23:45.560 --> 23:47.300
We need to see if it's still there.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.540
- No, get off me!

23:49.640 --> 23:52.920
- Not exactly America's sweethearts, hmm?

23:54.000 --> 23:54.740
- [Rodrigo] What's wrong?

23:54.840 --> 23:56.860
- I don't have to sleep with you

23:56.960 --> 23:58.460
to prove how I feel about you.

23:58.560 --> 23:59.300
- Noelle, I didn't mean--

23:59.400 --> 24:01.600
- No, tonight you can pick me or not.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.380
I don't care.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.480
You should be fighting for me.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.660
- Girl's got some fight
left in her after all.

24:08.760 --> 24:10.020
- Yeah, it's verbal tee-balling.

24:10.120 --> 24:12.180
It's not exactly an aphrodisiac.

24:12.280 --> 24:13.020
- It's hard to believe,

24:13.120 --> 24:14.460
but some people actually like a woman

24:14.560 --> 24:16.560
who can express her real feelings.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.860
- That's not part of my plan.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.440
(tense music)

24:23.720 --> 24:27.980
- Candi, it is now time for
you to enter Rodrigo's room.

24:28.080 --> 24:31.380
- No, no, I don't have
anything to say to that guy.

24:31.480 --> 24:32.700
If he wants to talk,

24:32.800 --> 24:34.460
you can tell him to bring a life jacket.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.860
- [Graham] I don't know
what to do with that.

24:35.960 --> 24:37.380
- Well, this is a problem.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.480
- (sighs) I'll handle it.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.460
- Things didn't go so well with Noelle.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.300
And now Candi refuses to see Rodrigo?

24:46.400 --> 24:49.660
What am I supposed to do,
pick the kindergarten teacher?

24:49.760 --> 24:51.180
Come on, Rach.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.780
- I actually think it's
pretty great that you

24:52.880 --> 24:54.660
and Noelle realised you're
not right for each other.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.540
- Okay, great for you and me.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.860
But I worry this is all you care about.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.720
- (groans) Oh my god, you're right.

25:02.720 --> 25:04.420
(sighs) I mean, like, my feelings for you

25:04.520 --> 25:07.120
have made it really hard
for me to produce you.

25:08.280 --> 25:10.420
And I should probably just
listen to Tommy anyway.

25:10.520 --> 25:11.540
- What did he say?

25:11.640 --> 25:14.940
- He had this crazy idea that
you should pick Candi tonight.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.100
- Candi?
- Yeah.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.180
- No.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.460
- Look, she would never say no

25:18.560 --> 25:20.580
at an actual elimination ceremony.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.100
Yeah, she just, like,
wants to me the final four.

25:23.200 --> 25:24.580
Besides, #CandRigo?

25:24.680 --> 25:28.140
It's like the classic
will they, won't they.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.240
But look, it's up to you.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.980
- Yeah.

25:33.080 --> 25:34.340
- She is--

25:34.440 --> 25:36.440
- Way too good at her job.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.380
- Seven minutes in heaven was perfect.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.060
I mean, Noelle's going home tonight.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.380
I'm sorry, that's just
where the guys landed.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.100
But at least we won't have to deal

25:48.200 --> 25:49.860
with her sad-sack self anymore.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.900
We can go into the final four with a bang.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.780
- Well, you'll be creating
that bang all by yourself.

25:54.880 --> 25:55.900
- What are you talking about?

25:56.000 --> 25:59.300
- (sighs) I'm leaving the show.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.140
- What?

26:01.240 --> 26:03.240
- Effective immediately.

26:04.720 --> 26:07.860
- Hey, is this,

26:07.960 --> 26:09.460
is this about me?

26:09.560 --> 26:12.340
- (scoffs) It's about me.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.740
I want a change.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.100
I mean, you have been
making the case all season

26:17.200 --> 26:19.340
that I don't get the show anymore

26:19.440 --> 26:21.440
the way that you and Timmy do.

26:22.040 --> 26:25.780
And once my ego got over
it, I realised you're right.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.140
- I never said you had to leave.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.180
I never meant that.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.280
- Mm, yeah, you did.

26:31.480 --> 26:33.760
But you should be running Everlasting.

26:35.320 --> 26:39.460
You and Tommy, you're
like me and Chet 2.0.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
And this is what you wanted, right?

26:42.760 --> 26:47.380
So I am not going to stand
in the way of your dreams.

26:47.480 --> 26:50.080
- No, that's not what I--
- Good luck, Rachel.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.220
You're gonna be amazing at this.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.240
(unsettling music)

27:00.760 --> 27:03.160
(door slams)

27:07.520 --> 27:10.080
(music swells)

27:13.040 --> 27:16.040
(suspenseful music)

27:24.920 --> 27:28.380
(facet squeaks)
(water rushing)

27:28.480 --> 27:31.480
(music intensifies)

27:34.640 --> 27:37.300
(door rattles open)

27:37.400 --> 27:38.740
(door slams)

27:38.840 --> 27:40.060
- [Tommy] Contestants are all set.

27:40.160 --> 27:40.900
- Where's Quinn?

27:41.000 --> 27:41.740
- She quit.

27:41.840 --> 27:43.420
- Right, but seriously, where is she?

27:43.520 --> 27:45.700
- For real, dude, she quit.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.540
- What?

27:46.640 --> 27:47.380
What the hell, Rachel?

27:47.480 --> 27:48.860
We have to push the ceremony
and figure this out.

27:48.960 --> 27:50.960
We're in the middle of a show.

27:52.800 --> 27:55.220
(scoffs) Okay, well, I'm calling her,

27:55.320 --> 27:56.540
or Fiona, or I have to do something.

27:56.640 --> 27:59.220
- Okay, well, I know what
you can do: your job.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.220
- Oh, what, so you're just,
like, automatically in charge?

28:01.320 --> 28:03.300
- You know what, if you
don't like it, you can leave.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.300
If you're staying,

28:04.400 --> 28:06.100
you can help produce the
elimination ceremony.

28:06.200 --> 28:06.980
It's up to you.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.560
(tense music)

28:11.360 --> 28:13.020
- All right.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.120
Let's do this, boss.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.040
- You've got this.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.260
- Places, everybody.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.940
And action, Graham.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.080
- What are you doing, what are you doing?
- Rachel, Rachel?

28:27.160 --> 28:28.660
What are you doing, what is this, a prank?

28:28.760 --> 28:29.580
Put mommy on the phone.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.260
- Quinn is officially off the show.

28:31.360 --> 28:32.660
I'm the showrunner now.

28:32.760 --> 28:33.940
- She's gone?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.580
And no one told me? (sighs)

28:35.680 --> 28:37.080
It was probably too painful
for her to say goodbye to me.

28:37.160 --> 28:37.920
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

28:38.000 --> 28:38.980
- [Graham] The show
must go on, right, Dan?

28:39.080 --> 28:39.940
- Okay, man.
- All right.

28:40.040 --> 28:40.780
Let's do this.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.340
Tonight, ladies, are you
ready for your closeups?

28:45.440 --> 28:48.940
Because these are the
postcards from the heart.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.380
None of us have even seen these videos.

28:50.480 --> 28:53.380
So we're going to be taking
this journey together.

28:53.480 --> 28:55.480
Okay, let's start with Sofia.

28:57.800 --> 29:00.620
(mysterious music)

29:00.720 --> 29:01.700
- Who am I?

29:01.800 --> 29:03.540
I'll spell it out for you.

29:03.640 --> 29:05.620
S is for spontaneous.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.540
O is for outrageous.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.660
F is for fun.

29:09.760 --> 29:11.020
- Oh my god. (laughs)
- I is for intriguing.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.580
And A is for all-star.

29:13.680 --> 29:15.580
I'm Sofia!

29:15.680 --> 29:16.900
- [Fiona] Quinn, great to see you.

29:17.000 --> 29:17.900
- Sorry to keep you waiting.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.720
- [Fiona] Thanks for staying so late.
- Fiona.

29:19.800 --> 29:20.540
- Oh my god, Quinn.

29:20.640 --> 29:23.060
I saw that amazing
picture that Chet posted

29:23.160 --> 29:25.100
with you and Chet Junior.

29:25.200 --> 29:27.700
It's seriously so adorable.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.380
I shared it, I liked it.

29:29.480 --> 29:31.480
#StepMommiesRule, #MommyBoss.

29:32.520 --> 29:34.100
- You posted that?

29:34.200 --> 29:36.580
- #DeathByCuteness, #Quinning.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.780
- (clears throat) Let's get
this pitch started, shall we?

29:39.880 --> 29:41.060
- Mm-hmm.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.400
- America, there is something

29:44.440 --> 29:46.140
that you might not know.

29:46.240 --> 29:48.960
I have a giant heart.

29:50.040 --> 29:53.220
And someone here on the
show actually captured it.

29:53.320 --> 29:56.200
(laughs) Let's put that on TV

29:57.520 --> 29:58.940
and see where it goes.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.060
(clapping)

30:00.160 --> 30:00.900
- Bravo.

30:01.000 --> 30:01.740
- Thank you.

30:01.840 --> 30:02.580
- Gorgeous.

30:02.680 --> 30:03.900
And now,

30:04.000 --> 30:06.640
America, we are down to our
final video of the night.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.220
Noelle.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.420
- I am grateful for this
opportunity to speak.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.220
My video ended up going
somewhere I didn't expect.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.420
But this is what I think
everyone here deserves to know.

30:19.520 --> 30:23.100
This is our producer, Rachel Goldberg.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.700
We're told she's here to
help us, to protect us.

30:26.800 --> 30:29.140
(gasping)

30:29.240 --> 30:31.920
(woman moaning)

30:33.120 --> 30:34.780
(woman laughing)

30:34.880 --> 30:37.580
But really, she's just here for herself.

30:37.680 --> 30:42.680
(woman moaning)
(edgy music builds)

30:53.320 --> 30:54.300
- Dan.

30:54.400 --> 30:55.940
- Look, she's beaming
it from her own tablet.

30:56.040 --> 30:56.860
There's no way to stop it.

30:56.960 --> 30:59.560
(Rachel gasps)

31:01.040 --> 31:02.460
(muffled chattering)
- Oh my god.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.560
This is unbelievable.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.020
- All of us are told sluts gets cut.

31:10.120 --> 31:13.260
Except when the slut is the
one pulling the strings.

31:13.360 --> 31:18.360
(heavy breathing)
(woman moaning)

31:19.760 --> 31:21.940
- How the hell did Noelle
get all that footage?

31:22.040 --> 31:24.520
(tense music)

31:25.480 --> 31:26.500
- Quinn.

31:26.600 --> 31:28.020
- Quinn, I've gotta say,

31:28.120 --> 31:30.700
I am really impressed by
what you've put together.

31:30.800 --> 31:31.900
What a story.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.660
- We certainly think so.

31:33.760 --> 31:35.740
- Yeah, this is exactly
the kind of project

31:35.840 --> 31:38.020
I've been pushing in our cable arm.

31:38.120 --> 31:42.340
Only problem is we've got
two-time Oscar winner Aaron George

31:42.440 --> 31:44.020
developing something similar.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.940
It's his first TV project.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.140
It's a major get.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.740
- Well, let's sit down with him

31:50.840 --> 31:54.020
and see if we can merge our ideas.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.740
- He'd certainly like Candi. (chuckles)

31:56.840 --> 32:00.100
- (laughs) Oh, I'm sure
he would love Candi.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.600
But Aaron George isn't
gonna sit down with you.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.380
This was a great presentation, sure.

32:07.480 --> 32:09.300
But everyone knows it's
not exactly your brand.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.140
- We are rebranding.

32:11.240 --> 32:12.340
That's the point.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.420
- Hey, I saw Hamilton on Broadway.

32:14.520 --> 32:15.580
Twice.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.780
Loved it.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.400
Doesn't mean I can go home
and write a hit musical.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.380
But why not try this as a reality show?

32:23.480 --> 32:26.820
With the fan love for Candi,
I'd buy that in a heartbeat.

32:26.920 --> 32:29.420
(tense music)

32:29.520 --> 32:31.820
- (sighs) Well, we're
really not interested

32:31.920 --> 32:33.920
in working on that kind of thing.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.220
- Okay, so you throw it to Rachel

32:36.320 --> 32:37.940
and Tommy to run day-to-day.

32:38.040 --> 32:39.860
You've already stepped
back from Everlasting.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.820
They could handle this, too.

32:41.920 --> 32:44.100
(Quinn huffs)

32:44.200 --> 32:45.580
Just think about it.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.460
- Oh, I will.

32:48.560 --> 32:51.260
I will really think about it.

32:51.360 --> 32:52.340
(music darkens)

32:52.440 --> 32:54.220
- All right, everybody back to work.

32:54.320 --> 32:57.020
Despite this sabotage, I
am still your showrunner.

32:57.120 --> 32:58.540
And if anyone has a problem with it,

32:58.640 --> 33:00.220
go ahead, you guys can
just leave right now.

33:00.320 --> 33:01.060
It's totally fine.

33:01.160 --> 33:01.900
Dan.

33:02.000 --> 33:02.740
- [Dan] What?

33:02.840 --> 33:04.060
- What's unemployment paying these days?

33:04.160 --> 33:04.900
- Uh.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.020
- That's right, guys, let's reset.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.140
Let's shoot this elimination
ceremony in five.

33:08.240 --> 33:08.980
(door rattles)

33:09.080 --> 33:11.060
(faint chattering)

33:11.160 --> 33:13.160
- [Noelle] How does it feel?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.500
- What, to be slut-shamed
at my place of business?

33:16.600 --> 33:17.980
I mean, good looking out, Noelle.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.300
You sure took woman-on-woman
crime to a whole new level.

33:20.400 --> 33:24.260
- Are you actually trying to
make me out to be the bad guy?

33:24.360 --> 33:26.380
You invented woman-on-woman crime.

33:26.480 --> 33:28.180
It's what this whole show is about, right?

33:28.280 --> 33:29.580
I know what you did.

33:29.680 --> 33:31.340
You're lucky I didn't
show the real footage

33:31.440 --> 33:33.660
of what you let Roger do to me

33:33.760 --> 33:35.900
on that screen for all
those people to see.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.620
But I wasn't about to
re-victimize Maya or myself.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.620
- A guy basically copped a
feel while you were drug,

33:40.720 --> 33:43.860
and suddenly you're the
avenger for victims everywhere?

33:43.960 --> 33:46.660
(tense music)

33:46.760 --> 33:48.580
- Quinn told me what happened to you,

33:48.680 --> 33:51.040
how you must be reliving your own trauma.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.380
- She had no right to tell you that.

33:55.480 --> 33:58.020
- She was actually trying
to defend your behaviour.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.580
For some reason, she cares about you.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.100
And maybe that is the reason
you act the way you do.

34:03.200 --> 34:06.680
Or maybe it's just a convenient excuse.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.020
I may not be ready to
go public with my story,

34:10.120 --> 34:13.120
but I will never exploit
people the way you do.

34:14.480 --> 34:16.480
I will never turn out like you.

34:19.200 --> 34:21.800
(music swells)

34:27.400 --> 34:30.580
- Tonight we will know who
our final four all-stars are.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.680
August?

34:34.000 --> 34:37.300
- There's only one person who's been open

34:37.400 --> 34:39.340
and honest with me.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.860
The truth is I really like you, Candi.

34:42.960 --> 34:44.180
And I wanna be with you.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.820
- Hell yes.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.340
Take that, America.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.380
- That a girl.

34:48.480 --> 34:51.660
- Noelle, I have been blind to
what is right in front of me.

34:51.760 --> 34:54.420
This is my time to fight for you.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.260
You deserve that.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.860
(soft romantic music)

34:57.960 --> 34:58.700
- Good for her.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.900
- Well, bad for you.

35:00.000 --> 35:02.100
Your chances of winning
just got cut in half.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.620
- Aw.

35:03.720 --> 35:05.140
- I'm your boss now.

35:05.240 --> 35:07.100
You better start showing me some loyalty.

35:07.200 --> 35:07.940
- You know what, Rachel,

35:08.040 --> 35:09.900
I am totally fine losing one of my girls.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.860
Because what Noelle put up
on that screen is the truth.

35:12.960 --> 35:15.340
So top trying to ruin all
of us with your damage

35:15.440 --> 35:18.240
and seek help for that
demented little brain.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.920
That loyal enough for you?

35:23.120 --> 35:25.620
- [Graham] There you have
it, America, our final four.

35:25.720 --> 35:29.380
So tune in next week for an
explosively romantic finale.

35:29.480 --> 35:30.580
- [Sofia] Are you kidding me right now?

35:30.680 --> 35:31.660
- Bravo.
- Hello?

35:31.760 --> 35:33.020
- [Graham] Oh, oh, oh, of
course, of course, Sofia.

35:33.120 --> 35:34.940
- Tommy, I need you to pull Noelle in.

35:35.040 --> 35:36.060
- [Graham] We're very, very sad.

35:36.160 --> 35:37.460
- You know, get some
dumbass footage of her

35:37.560 --> 35:38.620
to air for broadcast.

35:38.720 --> 35:40.860
Get her to spout off some
vanilla nonsense, you know.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.380
I really don't care what it is.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.140
- Copy that.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.100
Can't exactly air the other one.

35:46.200 --> 35:47.340
Huh?

35:47.440 --> 35:50.360
(unsettling music)

36:04.080 --> 36:06.740
- Hey, you know what, screw Fiona.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.260
That presentation killed.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.360
- I know.

36:11.840 --> 36:14.820
- And you know what, maybe
Stripper Queens can be reality.

36:14.920 --> 36:17.580
We could, you know, give
it to Rachel and Tommy.

36:17.680 --> 36:20.500
Let somebody else work for our money.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.600
We don't need that day-to-day bullshit.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.400
Hey.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.720
Rachel will come back to you.

36:34.840 --> 36:36.840
- And what if she doesn't?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.500
(Chet sighs)

36:42.600 --> 36:44.600
- Then

36:49.120 --> 36:51.120
we move on.

36:52.440 --> 36:54.440
We've got a life.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.040
We're gonna have a real kid.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.280
You're gonna be a mom.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.420
And everything else is
gonna look like roadkill

37:06.520 --> 37:08.520
in the rearview mirror.

37:09.920 --> 37:10.700
Trust me.

37:10.800 --> 37:14.040
(soft affecting music)

37:19.840 --> 37:23.400
(Quinn laughs humorlessly)

37:58.600 --> 37:59.340

39:18.760 --> 39:21.260
- No, we don't have to talk.

39:21.360 --> 39:22.740
I mean, like, I know it's over.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.740
It never really started.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.380
And now you've seen in bright
lights on the big screen

39:27.480 --> 39:29.680
what everyone thinks
of me, who I really am.

39:32.040 --> 39:34.040
- Rachel, I know who you are.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.560
I've always known.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.700
I don't care about Noelle's video.

39:41.800 --> 39:43.800
I don't care about whatever you've done.

39:45.200 --> 39:48.000
Whatever makes you feel you
have to keep moving forward.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.720
We're the same, Rachel.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.080
I've never met anybody
who makes me feel so,

39:58.480 --> 40:01.520
(sighs) so invincible,
like we can do anything.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.000
We can get away with anything.

40:06.840 --> 40:08.840
I love what we are together.

40:11.040 --> 40:13.040
I love you.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.300
And everything you've done
only makes me love you more.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.620
(Rachel laughs dryly)

40:19.720 --> 40:23.040
And I wanna keep watching
you do it forever.

40:25.360 --> 40:26.620
- What's this?

40:26.720 --> 40:28.720
- My producer bonus.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.340
You won.

40:30.440 --> 40:33.680
(poignant piano music)

40:36.040 --> 40:38.040
Come here.

40:48.280 --> 40:50.280
Marry me.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.360
Rachel?

40:56.240 --> 40:58.240
