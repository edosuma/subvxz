00:02.329 --> 00:03.541
Eyal Lavin?

00:03.623 --> 00:05.090
What's Mossad doing?

00:06.093 --> 00:07.459
Let's go.

00:07.461 --> 00:10.429
You're never boring.
Maybe the riviera next time.

00:11.467 --> 00:13.194
I don't know.

00:13.783 --> 00:15.196
Everything's better in Israel.

00:15.367 --> 00:17.601
Simon
is a master spy.

00:17.603 --> 00:20.070
Get intimate enough on the man,
and he'll tell you everything.

00:20.072 --> 00:22.239
He was playing you.
I have to call it.

00:22.241 --> 00:23.941
You're blown.

00:23.943 --> 00:26.143
I'm sending you
back to the DPD.

00:26.145 --> 00:28.112
We need to talk.
I can't marry you.

00:28.114 --> 00:29.813
- Parker--
- You should have this back.

00:29.815 --> 00:31.281
Bye, Auggie.

00:33.018 --> 00:35.953
This guy doesn't get a pass
just 'cause he's handicapped.

August Anderson.

00:51.037 --> 00:53.137
Time to go.

00:53.139 --> 00:54.605
Your bail's been posted.

00:54.607 --> 00:57.007
By whom?
I didn't call anyone.

00:57.009 --> 00:58.642
You wanna ask him
yourself?

00:58.644 --> 01:01.645
He doesn't.

01:03.948 --> 01:06.450
I trusted you,
you know.

01:06.452 --> 01:08.552
But that's
past tense.

01:08.554 --> 01:10.688
I gave you
an entire division.

01:10.690 --> 01:13.590
An opportunity
half the building dreams of

01:13.592 --> 01:15.793
and an investigation
into Jai's death,

01:15.795 --> 01:18.195
one of our own
on our own soil.

01:18.197 --> 01:19.663
Arthur,
let me explain.

01:19.665 --> 01:22.366
And then
you reward that trust

01:22.368 --> 01:25.102
with a reckless and dangerous
trip to see your girlfriend

01:25.104 --> 01:27.638
and a public incident
of drunken assault.

01:27.640 --> 01:30.641
She was my fiancee.

01:30.643 --> 01:33.010
Also past tense.

01:33.012 --> 01:35.546
Good operatives
become careless drunks

01:35.548 --> 01:39.249
right before they become
burnouts or doubles.

01:41.219 --> 01:43.420
I'm taking the OSP
away from you.

01:43.422 --> 01:46.490
You're gonna go back to the DPD
and work hard for Joan.

01:46.492 --> 01:49.493
Show me I wasn't wrong.

01:57.769 --> 01:59.369
Lena?

01:59.371 --> 02:01.238
Hey, I really
need to talk to you.

02:01.240 --> 02:02.539
Annie,
if it's about a mission,

02:02.541 --> 02:03.874
you don't work for me
anymore.

02:03.876 --> 02:06.477
Well, I found a new way in
with Simon Fischer.

02:06.479 --> 02:09.513
He came back.
I can get this guy, I know it.

02:09.514 --> 02:11.715
I'm really not interested
in a turf battle

02:11.717 --> 02:13.417
with Joan and Arthur.

02:13.419 --> 02:15.119
Isn't there some scenario
that we could

02:15.121 --> 02:17.187
continue our work
together?

02:17.189 --> 02:18.789
On an unsanctioned
mission?

02:18.791 --> 02:19.890
I thought
maybe I could

02:19.892 --> 02:21.892
re-route the case file
through the DPD.

02:21.894 --> 02:25.696
I thought about that, but
the op originated in my office.

02:25.698 --> 02:27.731
You know how stove-piped
this place is.

02:27.733 --> 02:29.867
So that's it?

02:29.869 --> 02:31.869
Unfortunately,
it is.

02:33.705 --> 02:36.774
I have privileged access
to a top FSB operative.

02:36.776 --> 02:38.275
Are you telling me
I should walk away

02:38.277 --> 02:41.879
because someone decided
to move my desk down the hall?

02:46.384 --> 02:48.519
Have you developed feelings
for this guy?

02:48.521 --> 02:49.820
No.

02:49.822 --> 02:52.122
'Cause you're fighting
very hard for this.

02:52.124 --> 02:54.224
I just think
it's such a waste to let it go.

02:54.226 --> 02:56.193
I just need a little more time
to see it through.

02:56.195 --> 02:57.861
You did good
with the time you had.

02:57.863 --> 02:59.296
Focus on that.

02:59.298 --> 03:02.332
I know you'd like it otherwise,
but this chapter is over.

03:05.103 --> 03:06.236
Good luck,
Annie.

03:06.238 --> 03:09.239
The DPD is really lucky
to have you.

03:29.060 --> 03:31.328
- Hey, Auggie.
- Hey, Walker.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.430
How are you?

03:33.432 --> 03:34.431
Peachy. You?

03:34.433 --> 03:37.100
Better now.

03:39.772 --> 03:41.738
So we're puttin' the band
back together, huh?

03:41.740 --> 03:44.875
Who knew a huge institution
had a nostalgic side?

03:44.877 --> 03:48.812
And in the spirit
of old times,

03:48.814 --> 03:51.048
Joan has an assignment
for you.

03:51.050 --> 03:53.283
I haven't even
been to my desk yet.

03:53.285 --> 03:54.918
Well,
now you don't have to go.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.487
See how everything
works out.

03:57.489 --> 03:58.722
Just a second,
what's that?

03:58.724 --> 04:00.190
What's what?

04:00.192 --> 04:01.859
- This.
- Ah.

04:01.861 --> 04:03.861
I got into
a bit of a scuffle.

04:03.863 --> 04:06.530
You should see
the other guy. I can't.

04:06.532 --> 04:08.332
Hmm,
scuffle about what?

04:08.334 --> 04:10.200
It's nothing.

04:12.237 --> 04:14.771
You can't get rid of me
that fast.

04:14.773 --> 04:19.375
I'm okay. You should go.
Joan's waiting.

04:19.378 --> 04:21.577
This is a rolling file.

04:21.579 --> 04:23.213
Everything we have
is only two days old,

04:23.215 --> 04:25.749
so there are gaps to fill,
but here's what we do know:

04:25.751 --> 04:27.351
Officers in the field
have recovered

04:27.353 --> 04:29.186
a piece
of an Iranian missile.

04:29.188 --> 04:31.154
One of its components
is an eerie facsimile

04:31.156 --> 04:33.557
to American
proprietary technology.

04:33.559 --> 04:35.626
In other words,
somehow the Iranians

04:35.628 --> 04:37.261
have knocked off
our design.

04:37.263 --> 04:39.062
Do we have people
in the test facility?

04:39.064 --> 04:42.266
This mission will be run
on a variety of fronts,

04:42.268 --> 04:43.700
not all of them by us.

04:43.702 --> 04:45.769
The tests are getting
uncomfortably close to Israel,

04:45.771 --> 04:48.438
so they
must be looped in.

04:53.478 --> 04:56.280
Sorry.
I didn't mean to overstep.

04:57.515 --> 05:01.652
Yes,
Israel shares our concern.

05:01.654 --> 05:03.220
Where you come in
is to help surveil

05:03.222 --> 05:04.755
the architect
of this technology,

05:04.757 --> 05:08.492
an American rocket scientist
named Isaac Reiss.

05:08.494 --> 05:10.961
This is a joint operation,
and because it's on their turf,

05:10.963 --> 05:13.297
Mossad
will be running point.

05:13.299 --> 05:14.898
And who will I be
working with at Mossad?

05:14.900 --> 05:17.334
Saul Berkowitz,
one of their senior people.

05:17.336 --> 05:20.671
Missile tech specialist.
Oh, okay.

05:20.673 --> 05:23.340
Eyal Lavin
is out of the country,

05:23.342 --> 05:26.243
in case you were wondering.
No. I'm good.

05:26.245 --> 05:28.312
Good.

05:28.314 --> 05:31.114
Thanks, everybody.
That'll be all.

05:31.116 --> 05:33.183
Annie,

05:33.185 --> 05:36.186
I expect you'll give this
your undivided attention.

06:02.680 --> 06:04.181
What happened
to Saul Berkowitz?

06:04.183 --> 06:06.116
- He got sick.
- Oh.

06:06.118 --> 06:10.053
Yeah, I--ten beers I bought
him last night didn't help.

06:10.055 --> 06:12.622
You once said
everything's better in Israel.

06:12.624 --> 06:15.325
Well, now's your chance
to find out.

- <i>L'Chaim.</i>
<i>- L'Chaim.</i>

07:14.577 --> 07:16.078
There is something
I want to discuss with you

07:16.080 --> 07:17.813
about this operation.

07:17.815 --> 07:19.548
Wow, you weren't kidding
about work, huh?

07:19.550 --> 07:21.350
Well,
the intel is 48 hours old.

07:21.352 --> 07:23.452
We have no background
and no file.

07:23.454 --> 07:25.354
How do we know
we're following the right guy?

07:25.356 --> 07:27.156
'Cause he's our man
to follow.

07:27.158 --> 07:28.891
It's easier
to assume guilt.

07:28.893 --> 07:30.726
That way
you can be surprised.

07:30.728 --> 07:32.961
Have you ever
been surprised?

07:32.963 --> 07:34.963
Never.

07:36.733 --> 07:38.834
So Mossad's
theory is that he's been

07:38.836 --> 07:41.270
dead-dropping his missile tech
to his Persian handler?

07:41.272 --> 07:43.439
Yes, he's been taking
long walks around the city.

07:43.441 --> 07:46.108
It's very odd behavior.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.409
Why is that odd?

07:47.411 --> 07:49.511
Midday?
In our desert heat?

07:49.513 --> 07:51.647
In Jerusalem, we only
take walks in the evening,

07:51.649 --> 07:52.648
or none at all.

07:52.650 --> 07:54.249
What have
the tails found?

07:54.251 --> 07:57.553
- They'll figure it out.
- Hmm, so nothing.

07:57.555 --> 08:00.489
Is there an operational plan
in the meantime?

08:00.491 --> 08:02.024
Yes, we're gonna
keep an eye on the target

08:02.026 --> 08:03.692
while the techs
wire his house.

08:03.694 --> 08:05.728
How exactly?

08:05.730 --> 08:08.630
We're gonna
offer him a job.

08:08.632 --> 08:11.900
So we assume if he accepts
the job, that he's what?

08:11.902 --> 08:13.302
Well,
if he accepts the job,

08:13.304 --> 08:15.237
it means that he was
dissatisfied at his work,

08:15.239 --> 08:16.672
and if
he doesn't accept the job,

08:16.674 --> 08:18.974
it means that
he's been using them for intel.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.809
Then he's guilty
either way.

08:20.811 --> 08:23.178
Now you're just
putting words in my mouth.

08:23.180 --> 08:25.047
Listen,
this is a man of routine.

08:25.049 --> 08:26.215
This offer's
gonna shake him up.

08:26.217 --> 08:27.383
We'll see
how he reacts.

08:27.385 --> 08:29.985
We're bound
to learn something.

08:35.191 --> 08:38.092
This is to be continued
further in the morning.

08:38.095 --> 08:41.597
So you're eager
to get back to your hotel room?

08:41.599 --> 08:44.633
Come on, I'll walk you.

08:44.635 --> 08:46.435
This is truly
a sad day for me.

08:46.437 --> 08:49.805
I finally get you to my country,
and you have a man in your life.

08:49.807 --> 08:52.107
I assure you
there's not.

08:52.109 --> 08:55.110
That must be
what the change is.

08:55.112 --> 08:58.647
You're conflicted
about taking me up to your room.

08:58.649 --> 09:00.015
You shouldn't be.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.451
It wouldn't be
our first hotel room adventure.

09:02.453 --> 09:05.454
I remember.

09:06.923 --> 09:08.757
But you do want to talk to me
about something.

09:08.759 --> 09:10.592
I'm just asking
as a friend.

09:10.594 --> 09:12.828
I didn't know we were friends
officially.

09:12.830 --> 09:14.797
Hey, I don't just take anybody
to that restaurant.

09:14.799 --> 09:19.234
I'm flattered.

09:19.236 --> 09:23.906
You're flattered,
but you don't trust me.

09:23.908 --> 09:27.075
Not yet.

09:27.077 --> 09:29.778
Okay.

09:29.780 --> 09:32.781
Good night,
Neshama.

09:34.918 --> 09:37.519
Good night.

09:41.959 --> 09:43.358
Oh, hi, Auggie.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.562
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Yes.

09:46.564 --> 09:48.297
Come in.
Close the door.

09:48.299 --> 09:50.566
Uh-oh.

09:50.568 --> 09:53.902
- Why don't we sit down?
- Okay.

09:55.939 --> 10:00.642
So word has come down
that you'll begin therapy.

10:00.644 --> 10:04.379
This is mandated.

10:04.381 --> 10:07.850
Arthur's idea of punishment
sure is cruel and unusual.

10:07.852 --> 10:09.251
I think
that's an overreaction.

10:09.253 --> 10:11.487
Really? Forget that
I don't believe in therapy.

10:11.489 --> 10:14.056
Do you not believe in therapy,
or do you just not want to go?

10:14.058 --> 10:17.226
Come on, Joan. If I show
even the smallest vulnerability,

10:17.228 --> 10:19.027
they're gonna tell me
that I'm unfit to work,

10:19.029 --> 10:22.698
and I will be gone
forever.

10:22.700 --> 10:25.400
I know
this is difficult,

10:25.402 --> 10:26.935
but I don't think
you understand.

10:26.937 --> 10:30.339
You either go to therapy,
or you go on leave.

10:30.341 --> 10:33.175
- I'll take the leave.
- Auggie, this is not a choice.

10:33.177 --> 10:36.178
You have to do this.

10:40.183 --> 10:41.850
Even though
he's one of your countrymen,

10:41.852 --> 10:45.120
I urge you not to develop
any sympathies for the target.

10:45.122 --> 10:47.055
His name
is Isaac Reiss.

10:47.057 --> 10:48.657
No, he's the target. You see,
this is exactly what I mean.

10:48.659 --> 10:50.092
Thank you.

10:50.094 --> 10:51.593
We're here
to offer him a job.

10:51.595 --> 10:54.363
It's the perfect opportunity
to build a more complex profile.

10:54.365 --> 10:56.865
There are researchers
and profilers for that.

10:56.867 --> 10:57.900
See, that's one
of the many things

10:57.902 --> 10:59.468
that bother me
about the CIA.

10:59.470 --> 11:01.837
They want every operative
to do every job.

11:01.839 --> 11:03.872
At Mossad,
we are more specific.

11:03.874 --> 11:07.442
We only get the missions
that match our skills perfectly.

11:07.444 --> 11:10.546
What about this mission
makes it perfect for you?

11:10.548 --> 11:12.247
Well,
I'm good with Americans.

11:14.385 --> 11:16.451
Dr. Reiss!

11:19.355 --> 11:21.523
Hi. Annie.
Hi.

11:21.525 --> 11:23.492
- Eyal.
- Hi. Hi.

11:23.494 --> 11:25.761
Please call me Isaac.
You're from the states?

11:25.763 --> 11:28.063
Yeah, but I've been here
for a while.

11:28.065 --> 11:29.831
Wow. It's nice
to hear the accent.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.300
That's
a little sound of home.

11:31.302 --> 11:32.935
Yes. Yes.
Why would anyone

11:32.937 --> 11:35.537
want to speak Hebrew
in Jerusalem?

11:35.539 --> 11:39.508
I agree with you, Isaac.
It is. Please sit.

12:09.872 --> 12:11.239
It's so good
to meet you.

12:11.241 --> 12:13.775
Your company has made
such strides with new polymers.

12:13.777 --> 12:16.144
I'm very excited
to work together.

12:16.146 --> 12:18.814
I did bring some business cards
for you here.

12:18.816 --> 12:21.249
No, no. I think
you misunderstood.

12:21.251 --> 12:23.585
We don't want
to collaborate.

12:23.587 --> 12:25.253
We're here
to offer you a job.

12:25.255 --> 12:26.922
But I already
have a job.

12:26.924 --> 12:28.657
We're building
the next Concorde.

12:28.659 --> 12:30.325
We'd like you
to run the division.

12:30.327 --> 12:34.763
Are you--?
Are you--?

12:34.765 --> 12:38.367
I think I would have
heard something about that.

12:38.369 --> 12:42.404
Um, supersonic flight
is, uh, it's a passion of mine.

12:42.406 --> 12:46.708
- Is it really?
- Uh, yeah.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.543
Yeah.
Here, check this out.

12:48.545 --> 12:50.979
I've had this
ever since I was a kid.

12:50.981 --> 12:55.384
And when I was 11, I even
wrote a letter to Aerospatiale.

12:55.386 --> 12:57.119
Well, now young scientists
all over the world

12:57.121 --> 12:59.187
will be writing letters
to you.

12:59.189 --> 13:00.822
Our goal is to service
commercial passengers

13:00.824 --> 13:02.024
within seven years.

13:02.026 --> 13:04.126
Transatlantic to start,
then worldwide.

13:04.128 --> 13:05.727
You can bring
whoever you'd like.

13:05.729 --> 13:07.529
We want to create
the best environment

13:07.531 --> 13:08.930
for you to do your work.

13:08.932 --> 13:10.265
- Oh, man.
- But you're gonna have to leave

13:10.267 --> 13:14.036
your current job
immediately.

13:14.038 --> 13:16.238
Uh...

13:16.240 --> 13:18.840
Yeah. Helios has been
really good to me.

13:18.842 --> 13:21.810
You know, they, um,
they paid for my PhD,

13:21.812 --> 13:26.248
and I'm not sure that I can--
You can.

13:26.250 --> 13:27.783
I don't know.

13:27.785 --> 13:29.651
I don't know, I'm gonna need
some time to think about this.

13:29.653 --> 13:31.887
Well, we're gonna need
your answer now, Dr. Reiss,

13:31.889 --> 13:34.289
otherwise, we'll move on
to the next candidate.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.826
Next candidate.

13:41.364 --> 13:45.333
I'm sorry. That's a tactic
we learned in HR.

13:45.335 --> 13:47.669
There are
no other candidates.

13:47.671 --> 13:52.274
You must
think I ruffle so easily.

13:52.276 --> 13:53.642
Sorry, it's just
a lot to take in.

13:53.644 --> 13:56.478
My life has been changing
so fast lately.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.746
Everything's--

13:57.748 --> 14:00.449
Yeah, and a new city
is enough of a change.

14:00.451 --> 14:02.184
- Yeah.
- What brought you to Israel

14:02.186 --> 14:04.720
in the first place?
I came for work,

14:04.722 --> 14:07.989
and then I found love.

14:07.991 --> 14:11.927
That's sweet.
Does this love have a name?

14:11.929 --> 14:14.796
I mostly
call her <i>"Metuka."</i>

14:14.798 --> 14:18.433
I'm still learning other ways
to say "sweetheart" in Hebrew.

14:18.435 --> 14:21.103
<i>Yakirati, motek sheli,</i>
<i>yafati,</i>

14:21.105 --> 14:23.872
but that's only
if she's actually pretty.

14:23.874 --> 14:26.208
What does she
look like?

14:26.210 --> 14:29.544
She. Anyways...

14:29.546 --> 14:31.012
now I need to get back
to my office.

14:31.014 --> 14:34.316
Um, it was really nice
to meet you both.

14:36.185 --> 14:38.086
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you.

14:38.088 --> 14:39.554
- Mr.--
- Listen, Dr. Reiss,

14:39.556 --> 14:41.289
don't let my colleague here
deceive you.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.825
This opportunity
will go away.

14:43.827 --> 14:46.328
We look forward
to hearing your answer.

14:46.330 --> 14:48.797
Yeah, well,
I'll be in touch soon.

14:54.337 --> 14:55.871
Not only
does he butcher Hebrew,

14:55.873 --> 14:57.672
he's lying as well.
About which part?

14:57.674 --> 15:00.642
We have tails on him.
There is no woman in his life.

15:12.433 --> 15:16.002
Why would he lie
about something like that?

15:16.004 --> 15:18.671
Obviously, he wanted
to gain your sympathies.

15:18.673 --> 15:20.940
It worked.
He's better than I thought.

15:20.942 --> 15:23.209
Or maybe he actually
has a girlfriend.

15:23.211 --> 15:25.678
Everyone he works with
thinks he's single.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.714
Surveillance have never seen
or heard a woman.

15:27.716 --> 15:29.782
I'm just trying to get
a working theory here.

15:29.784 --> 15:33.152
The guy takes long walks during
the day to dead-drop his tech.

15:33.154 --> 15:36.089
A whole team of Mossad
operatives is following him,

15:36.091 --> 15:37.257
and what have they found?

15:37.259 --> 15:38.758
Well, obviously
he's using a method

15:38.760 --> 15:40.460
of transferring information
that we've never seen before.

15:40.462 --> 15:41.894
A method
Mossad hasn't seen?

15:41.896 --> 15:43.429
He's a rocket scientist.

15:43.431 --> 15:45.632
He's a kid in a man's suit.
He's not a villain.

15:45.634 --> 15:47.267
Well, obviously,
you made a connection,

15:47.269 --> 15:49.235
and now
you can't be objective.

15:50.938 --> 15:53.072
I can smell
you have dogs.

15:53.074 --> 15:55.241
I love dogs.

15:55.243 --> 15:59.112
But you're trying to cover up
their smell with verte violette.

15:59.114 --> 16:02.482
L'Artisan makes an amber perfume
that might serve you better.

16:02.484 --> 16:05.818
And when you walked in, I heard
you're wearing stilettos,

16:05.820 --> 16:09.522
despite the long hallways
and two flights of stairs.

16:09.524 --> 16:13.826
So you're
probably single.

16:13.828 --> 16:15.461
We have a lot in common.

16:15.463 --> 16:18.064
Were you happy about the
Redskins' win last night too?

16:18.066 --> 16:19.699
Your misguided flirting
aside,

16:19.701 --> 16:21.467
how could you know
that I'm a Redskins fan?

16:21.469 --> 16:23.936
Well, it's DC.
I took a shot.

16:23.938 --> 16:24.937
I see.

16:24.939 --> 16:26.873
Most people do.

16:26.875 --> 16:29.409
Look,
after my accident,

16:29.411 --> 16:31.311
everyone wanted me
to go to therapy,

16:31.313 --> 16:35.014
but I didn't need it then,
and I don't need it now.

16:35.016 --> 16:36.949
I agree.

16:36.951 --> 16:38.651
You know,
I read your file,

16:38.653 --> 16:43.923
and I understand why you broke
a bottle over that guy's head.

16:43.925 --> 16:46.225
It makes sense after everything
you've been through.

16:46.227 --> 16:49.095
You have no idea
what I've been through.

16:49.097 --> 16:50.496
I've spent
the past seven years

16:50.498 --> 16:53.399
working with veterans,
so I have a pretty good idea.

16:53.401 --> 16:55.868
That's a classic
shrink tactic, right?

16:55.870 --> 16:58.938
Finding some common ground
with your patient

16:58.940 --> 17:00.373
in the first
five minutes.

17:00.375 --> 17:02.108
Tactic or not,
it's still true.

17:02.110 --> 17:04.042
Well,
that's rather insincere.

17:04.045 --> 17:05.377
Which part?

17:05.380 --> 17:07.280
It would be stupid of me
to tell you anything.

17:07.281 --> 17:08.915
I'd be signing
my own pink slip.

17:08.916 --> 17:11.684
Yes, therapists
love vulnerabilities,

17:11.685 --> 17:13.720
and spy agencies
hate them,

17:13.722 --> 17:15.855
but here's the problem:

17:15.857 --> 17:18.023
Someone upstairs
already thinks you're unstable,

17:18.026 --> 17:20.760
so unless you're planning
on building bombs,

17:20.762 --> 17:24.262
it's only going to help you
to talk about things.

17:24.265 --> 17:25.832
What a great incentive.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.165
Then here's one more:

17:27.167 --> 17:29.335
If you don't address
the source of your anger,

17:29.337 --> 17:31.904
there will be another incident
like the one at the bar.

17:31.906 --> 17:34.707
So if I don't come back,
you'll write me up as crazy.

17:34.709 --> 17:36.209
If you don't come back,

17:36.211 --> 17:38.478
I'll stamp your file
and give you a gold star.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.213
No questions asked.

17:40.215 --> 17:41.647
You will lie for me?

17:41.649 --> 17:43.182
It's up to you
whether you feel

17:43.184 --> 17:46.652
in control of whatever's
going on in your life.

17:46.654 --> 17:49.155
Okay.

17:49.157 --> 17:51.357
I'll take the gold star
now then.

17:51.359 --> 17:53.860
Thanks.

17:53.862 --> 17:56.329
Oh, by the way,
I lied earlier.

17:56.331 --> 17:57.897
I root for the Bears.

18:05.273 --> 18:07.673
Hey, it's me.

18:07.675 --> 18:11.110
Look, I have some, uh,
some really exciting news.

18:11.112 --> 18:14.680
You know that meeting I had
today with Stringham Aerospace?

18:14.682 --> 18:19.786
They offered me
an exciting opportunity that--

18:19.788 --> 18:22.622
uh, it has the potential
to change everything for us.

18:22.624 --> 18:27.160
So just call me back
when you get this, okay?

18:32.634 --> 18:34.534
I should count the words,
maybe it's a code.

18:34.536 --> 18:36.702
It's not code.
He called his girlfriend

18:36.704 --> 18:40.440
to celebrate, and now
he's making dinner for two.

18:40.442 --> 18:42.008
It could be
all for our benefit.

18:42.010 --> 18:44.143
He left a voicemail
on a dummy mailbox.

18:44.145 --> 18:47.380
At best, it's code;
At worst, he's on to us.

18:47.382 --> 18:48.681
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

18:48.683 --> 18:50.149
that someone
would leave a voicemail?

18:50.151 --> 18:51.784
Because
it's terrible practice.

18:51.786 --> 18:54.187
A recording of your voice
out there in the world?

18:54.189 --> 18:55.721
When I get voicemail,
I hang up.

18:55.723 --> 18:56.856
Well,
your paranoias aside,

18:56.858 --> 18:58.791
there are still
other possibilities.

18:58.793 --> 18:59.992
You know what,
you're right.

18:59.994 --> 19:01.093
You're right.
He's a nerd.

19:01.095 --> 19:02.428
He's probably
calling his mother.

19:02.430 --> 19:04.764
He's calling a woman
with an unlisted number

19:04.766 --> 19:06.365
and no outgoing message.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.334
Also known
as a prostitute.

19:08.336 --> 19:10.369
Surveillance has never seen
her, and she's convinced him

19:10.371 --> 19:13.306
to keep their relationship
a secret at work.

19:16.009 --> 19:18.544
He's dating a spy.

19:18.546 --> 19:20.112
No,
you don't know that.

19:20.114 --> 19:23.483
He probably doesn't even know
she's stealing the technology.

19:25.219 --> 19:27.687
Of course,
there are no dead-drops,

19:27.689 --> 19:30.690
that's why the tails
never saw anything.

19:32.426 --> 19:33.659
Okay.

19:33.661 --> 19:34.894
Here's what we're gonna do.

19:34.896 --> 19:38.498
I'm gonna read Isaac in
and make him an ally.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.132
Then we have a shot
at getting to her.

19:40.134 --> 19:42.468
Whoa, nobody's
revealing our identity.

19:42.470 --> 19:43.769
It's the cleanest way.

19:43.771 --> 19:46.506
Plus we get an asset
who's a rocket scientist.

19:46.508 --> 19:48.074
Everybody wins.
Nobody wins.

19:48.076 --> 19:49.942
We don't even know
his level of involvement.

19:49.944 --> 19:52.245
If someone's running him and
they find out we're watching,

19:52.247 --> 19:53.479
they'll kill him.

19:53.481 --> 19:54.847
That's a risk
of the game he's playing.

19:54.849 --> 19:57.517
He doesn't know
he's playing the game.

19:57.519 --> 20:00.520
I wanna try this.
He's a U.S. citizen.

20:00.522 --> 20:01.888
In my country.

20:01.890 --> 20:03.956
Our working together
is an act of goodwill,

20:03.958 --> 20:06.092
so you can't tell me
how to run this mission.

20:06.094 --> 20:08.528
Actually, I can.

20:10.531 --> 20:12.098
What does that mean?

20:12.100 --> 20:14.000
It's just very imperative
that you follow my directive.

20:14.002 --> 20:15.368
I run point.

20:15.370 --> 20:17.970
No,
something's wrong.

20:17.972 --> 20:20.806
Tell me.

20:20.808 --> 20:22.041
This came down
from my superior

20:22.043 --> 20:23.643
through her contact
in the CIA.

20:23.645 --> 20:25.044
What did?

20:25.046 --> 20:27.079
They want me
to run a full cogent profile.

20:27.081 --> 20:28.281
A what?

20:28.283 --> 20:29.815
Langley has asked me
to evaluate

20:29.817 --> 20:31.851
your well-being
in the field.

20:31.853 --> 20:35.388
My Agency's
investigating me?

20:40.530 --> 20:42.261
No one is investigating you.

20:42.715 --> 20:45.082
They asked a foreign agency
to evaluate me.

20:45.084 --> 20:48.152
No, they asked a fellow
operative to check in on you.

20:48.154 --> 20:49.987
They're worried about you.
Right, they're worried.

20:49.989 --> 20:51.756
The day they wonder
whether you're fit to serve

20:51.758 --> 20:53.157
is the day
you stop serving.

20:53.159 --> 20:55.560
But you are serving.
Right here, right now.

20:55.562 --> 20:59.096
Right, so you can watch me
and report back.

20:59.098 --> 21:01.365
This is
what agencies do.

21:01.367 --> 21:04.368
They check on their people.
It's common practice.

21:08.173 --> 21:11.642
You think they're right
to be concerned.

21:11.644 --> 21:13.744
At Mossad,
we hear things.

21:13.746 --> 21:15.813
We heard that
a CIA operative was killed

21:15.815 --> 21:17.648
in an explosion
on American soil.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.617
How could you
know that?

21:19.619 --> 21:22.520
Just Agency chatter.

21:22.522 --> 21:24.522
Were you there?

21:27.759 --> 21:30.361
Listen,
everyone I know,

21:30.363 --> 21:32.196
everyone has been touched
by a similar event.

21:32.198 --> 21:35.867
It's a reality
of life in Israel.

21:35.869 --> 21:38.636
I just want you to know
that it's okay to feel

21:38.638 --> 21:40.505
whatever it is
that you're feeling.

21:40.507 --> 21:43.508
Don't underestimate
how much it changes you.

21:44.643 --> 21:46.043
Suddenly,
it feels like

21:46.045 --> 21:49.714
everything could be taken away
at a moment's notice.

21:49.716 --> 21:52.783
So yeah, I think
they're right to be worried.

21:55.721 --> 21:58.723
Who ordered
the assessment?

22:00.025 --> 22:01.792
I honestly don't know.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.901
Annie, come on.
Don't do this.

22:09.903 --> 22:11.736
What do you think
it's gonna achieve?

22:13.673 --> 22:15.439
- Yes?
- Hey, it's Annie.

22:15.441 --> 22:16.707
Is there a problem?

22:16.709 --> 22:17.942
No, I just
wanted you to know

22:17.944 --> 22:20.177
that I am working successfully
with Mossad

22:20.179 --> 22:21.846
and that we have
a surveillance operation

22:21.848 --> 22:24.181
that I think will yield
great results.

22:24.183 --> 22:28.853
I'm happy to hear that,
in spite of any specifics.

22:28.855 --> 22:31.389
We're working on those,
I promise.

22:31.391 --> 22:34.458
I would hope.

22:34.460 --> 22:36.994
Is there anything I can do
for you in the meantime?

22:36.996 --> 22:40.331
Mm, I don't think
I need anything from you.

22:40.333 --> 22:43.801
Oh. Okay.

22:43.803 --> 22:45.603
Is that
all you wanted to say?

22:45.605 --> 22:47.772
For now.

22:47.774 --> 22:50.441
Okay. Good.

22:57.783 --> 23:00.785
Do you feel better?

23:10.963 --> 23:12.797
No.

23:12.799 --> 23:14.799
I'm sorry.

23:15.901 --> 23:19.470
That's why
I never call in.

23:34.019 --> 23:35.620
Hello?

23:35.622 --> 23:37.555
Hey, Annie,
it's Isaac.

23:37.557 --> 23:39.523
Hi. How are you?

23:39.525 --> 23:42.226
I'm all right.
I'm all right. I'm--

23:42.228 --> 23:46.197
was hoping we could meet
to talk some more about the job.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.567
- Sure.
4:00?

23:49.569 --> 23:52.536
Do you know the cafe on
the north side of Zion Square?

23:52.538 --> 23:54.739
I do.
I do.

23:54.741 --> 23:58.075
Annie, would you mind
coming alone?

23:58.077 --> 24:01.646
No, that's fine.
I understand.

24:01.648 --> 24:03.748
Okay.

24:07.686 --> 24:10.655
Better wire you.

24:10.657 --> 24:13.658
Why?
So I don't tip him off?

24:15.527 --> 24:17.662
No, it's because
he's still the target,

24:17.664 --> 24:20.665
and I want to make sure
you're protected.

24:25.704 --> 24:27.405
Wow,
you changed your hair.

24:27.407 --> 24:29.774
Looks great.
Thanks.

24:29.776 --> 24:31.208
A lot of things
are changing.

24:31.210 --> 24:33.177
And this is the part
where I sit.

24:33.179 --> 24:35.179
Mmhmm.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.817
I know you've had
a lot on your plate...

24:39.819 --> 24:44.655
But it's about to overflow.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.991
Rumor is,
you're on the short list

24:46.993 --> 24:49.927
to be the new ambassador
to China.

24:49.929 --> 24:53.864
This is real, Arthur.
It's finally happening.

24:53.866 --> 24:55.166
Has it been ten years

24:55.168 --> 24:56.967
since we went with that
congressional delegation?

24:56.969 --> 24:59.537
Our hotel room in Beijing
was a closet.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.206
And our tour guide
barely spoke English.

25:02.208 --> 25:04.141
But you charmed them all,

25:04.143 --> 25:05.342
and they remember you.

25:05.344 --> 25:07.878
They reached out to state
last week.

25:07.880 --> 25:10.881
And with Ambassador Phillips
retiring,

25:10.883 --> 25:14.385
you'll get your chance.

25:14.387 --> 25:16.554
I'm sorry, Gina.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.956
I know this is something
we wanted to do together.

25:21.693 --> 25:24.595
None of that
matters now.

25:24.597 --> 25:26.931
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

25:30.135 --> 25:35.139
So my whole life has been
devoted to my work at Helios.

25:35.141 --> 25:37.108
It's all I ever imagined
for myself.

25:37.110 --> 25:38.509
I'm safe there,

25:38.511 --> 25:43.013
and leaving seems harder
than moving to a new country.

25:44.484 --> 25:47.551
I don't want to turn my back
on people who believe in me,

25:47.553 --> 25:49.487
but at the same time,
I can't ignore

25:49.489 --> 25:51.989
the opportunity
to do great work,

25:51.991 --> 25:56.227
to explore new avenues,
innovation, and discovery.

25:56.229 --> 25:58.329
Okay, now I just have
to convince my girlfriend

25:58.331 --> 25:59.697
that this is a good idea.

25:59.699 --> 26:01.665
What's her name?

26:04.169 --> 26:05.736
You're gonna think
this is crazy,

26:05.738 --> 26:08.005
but she doesn't want me
talking about our relationship

26:08.007 --> 26:09.573
with people
I work with.

26:09.575 --> 26:12.476
It's still early, and she's
superstitious, and I just--

26:12.478 --> 26:14.678
Well, we don't work together,
technically.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.814
Not yet, anyway.

26:16.816 --> 26:18.983
Yeah, I suppose
you're right about that.

26:18.985 --> 26:23.754
Okay.
Her name is Ilana Ben Eshkol.

26:23.756 --> 26:26.490
- Mm-hmm.
- And she's a scientist too,

26:26.492 --> 26:28.092
which is amazing,
'cause she's the first woman

26:28.094 --> 26:30.427
I've ever been with who actually
understands what I do.

26:30.429 --> 26:32.029
Do you have
a picture of her?

26:32.031 --> 26:34.198
- Yeah.
- Let's see.

26:36.468 --> 26:38.469
Uh...

26:42.574 --> 26:45.042
You look very happy.

26:49.715 --> 26:50.714
Annie.

27:48.106 --> 27:50.975
Annie! Annie!

27:50.977 --> 27:52.710
Don't!

28:21.190 --> 28:23.657
Here.
I got the guy's cell phone.

28:23.659 --> 28:27.928
At least Mossad can find out
who he was working for.

28:27.930 --> 28:29.196
I know
this is it for me.

28:29.198 --> 28:30.664
You're gonna tell them
I'm a loose cannon

28:30.666 --> 28:31.966
and that I'm reckless and then
Langley's gonna take me

28:31.968 --> 28:33.000
out of the field forever.
Annie.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.234
Look, I know
that this life

28:34.236 --> 28:36.837
is so easy for you,
but it's hard for me.

28:36.839 --> 28:40.007
Hey, it isn't.

28:40.009 --> 28:43.310
It isn't easy for me.

28:43.312 --> 28:46.013
Come on,
I'll show you why.

28:52.187 --> 28:54.788
That's my son
down there,

28:54.790 --> 28:57.491
Avi.

28:57.493 --> 29:00.060
Number four
in the yellow.

29:05.600 --> 29:09.336
My ex-wife got custody of him
years ago,

29:09.338 --> 29:11.639
but I still see him
as often as I can,

29:11.641 --> 29:14.208
even if it is
from a distance.

29:21.950 --> 29:23.450
Eyal, are you sure
I should be here?

29:23.452 --> 29:25.252
I mean...

29:25.254 --> 29:28.789
We never talk about
our real lives, not like this.

29:28.791 --> 29:32.493
But we are now.

29:32.495 --> 29:34.161
You saved my life.

29:34.163 --> 29:36.563
You may not trust me yet,
but I trust you.

29:38.901 --> 29:41.468
You think
I'm a hardened man?

29:41.470 --> 29:44.838
I struggle with this life,
same as you.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.242
How strange it is
and the cost,

29:48.244 --> 29:49.843
but you're
working towards

29:49.845 --> 29:51.912
making this world
a better place,

29:51.914 --> 29:55.883
and you're not alone.

29:55.885 --> 29:59.386
It doesn't always
feel that way.

29:59.388 --> 30:02.389
You're struggling
with something. Let me help you.

30:09.064 --> 30:12.366
They found Isaac.

30:13.868 --> 30:17.137
Let's go.

30:28.249 --> 30:31.652
I decided to come back.

30:31.654 --> 30:34.788
Do not mistake this
as a sign of growth.

30:36.558 --> 30:38.058
I really hope
you're here,

30:38.060 --> 30:40.461
otherwise, I made
a grand entrance for nothing.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.463
I'm here.
Hi, Auggie.

30:42.465 --> 30:45.799
Please, take a seat.
Yeah.

30:45.801 --> 30:47.501
I really hope

30:47.503 --> 30:48.902
you haven't
heard this yet

30:48.904 --> 30:50.738
because I want to be
the one to tell you.

30:50.740 --> 30:52.740
Is this good news
or bad?

30:52.742 --> 30:55.576
I'm on the short list, Joan,
to be the ambassador to China.

30:55.578 --> 30:58.078
Well,
congratulations.

30:58.080 --> 31:00.547
I always knew
it would happen for you.

31:00.549 --> 31:02.182
- So here's the plan.
- There's a plan?

31:02.184 --> 31:03.751
Yes, I spoke to Dennis,
and he's gonna be

31:03.753 --> 31:06.019
putting a good word in
for you to run Beijing station.

31:06.021 --> 31:07.721
- You did what?
- It's the biggest agency job

31:07.723 --> 31:09.723
in the Far East. You'll whip 'em
all into shape, no doubt.

31:09.725 --> 31:12.126
You spoke with the East Asia
desk before you spoke with me?

31:12.128 --> 31:13.761
Yeah, but--
well, no, no, wait, no, no--

31:13.763 --> 31:16.764
Let's just put that aside
for a moment.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.468
Do you consider the timing
of this to be curious?

31:21.470 --> 31:22.903
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you're suddenly

31:22.905 --> 31:24.505
on the short list
in the exact moment

31:24.507 --> 31:27.174
you're looking
like a pariah.

31:28.576 --> 31:32.780
Why are you turning this
amazing news into an indictment?

31:32.782 --> 31:34.848
I've been dreaming about this
for over a decade.

31:34.850 --> 31:37.851
I know,
and you should go for it.

31:37.853 --> 31:40.087
I want you to,

31:40.089 --> 31:43.891
but I've done my time
in the field.

31:43.893 --> 31:47.494
- So this is an impasse?
- That's reactionary.

31:47.496 --> 31:48.896
We can negotiate this.

31:48.898 --> 31:50.497
We negotiate things
all day long.

31:50.499 --> 31:53.567
You know as well as I do
what an ambassador does.

31:53.569 --> 31:55.536
I'll be the face
of American policy in China,

31:55.538 --> 31:57.671
and I will need my wife
on my arm.

31:57.673 --> 31:59.940
Then you married
the wrong kind of wife.

31:59.942 --> 32:01.875
So this is an impasse.

32:01.877 --> 32:04.878
Well, I'm glad
we negotiated that.

32:17.025 --> 32:20.027
Yes?

32:20.029 --> 32:23.764
Simon Fischer.

32:23.766 --> 32:28.068
Is that a target,
an asset, or a boyfriend?

32:28.070 --> 32:31.238
I'm not even
gonna touch that.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.473
I see him.

32:36.978 --> 32:38.979
Let me do this.

32:44.152 --> 32:46.753
Isaac,
it's okay.

32:48.556 --> 32:51.525
We're here to help you.

32:51.527 --> 32:53.594
You're Mossad.

32:53.596 --> 32:55.395
Him too?
Wow, that's a surprise.

32:55.397 --> 32:58.265
- I'm full of surprises.
- Yeah.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.101
I know this is hard,
but we have a lot to talk about.

33:01.103 --> 33:05.572
It's Ilana, isn't it?
She's spying for somebody.

33:05.574 --> 33:08.242
Who is it, Syria?
Lebanon? Iran?

33:08.244 --> 33:10.277
- Iran.
- Iran. Right.

33:10.279 --> 33:13.981
- She's one of their best.
- Yeah.

33:13.983 --> 33:15.983
How long
have you known?

33:15.985 --> 33:19.286
Oh,
since this afternoon.

33:20.922 --> 33:22.556
It's the only thing
that made any sense.

33:22.558 --> 33:25.592
- Sorry.
- Uh-huh.

33:25.594 --> 33:29.730
Deep down, you must have known
something was wrong before that.

33:29.732 --> 33:32.599
We met at, uh,
at the Farmer's Market.

33:32.601 --> 33:34.935
We were both
buying organic pomegranates.

33:34.937 --> 33:38.205
She said
it was kismet.

33:38.207 --> 33:40.607
I was fighting
this horrible feeling

33:40.609 --> 33:42.709
that maybe
she was married.

33:46.615 --> 33:49.950
I never considered it would be
something this awful.

33:49.952 --> 33:52.352
Those are the words
of a helpless man.

33:52.354 --> 33:54.554
That's not you.

33:54.556 --> 33:58.558
You still have the power
to make this right.

33:58.560 --> 34:00.794
How could that
possibly be true?

34:00.796 --> 34:03.797
You could help us
bring her in.

34:16.511 --> 34:18.812
Okay.

34:18.813 --> 34:21.915
Okay.

34:21.917 --> 34:24.583
How do I do that?

34:24.585 --> 34:27.654
Come on.

34:41.295 --> 34:45.364
Uh, hey, I meant--I meant
to give this back to you.

34:50.137 --> 34:53.840
Enrico Fermi
used to walk through Rome

34:53.842 --> 34:56.842
when he couldn't solve
a physics problem.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.479
He's my hero,
so I like to walk too.

34:59.481 --> 35:01.614
A few days ago, I thought
someone was following me.

35:01.616 --> 35:04.017
It seemed
pretty crazy at the time,

35:04.019 --> 35:07.420
but now I think there--
there was.

35:07.422 --> 35:10.723
I know this must seem
like a horrible intrusion.

35:10.725 --> 35:13.159
Yeah,
because it is.

35:13.161 --> 35:18.298
I mean, someone's
been watching everything I do.

35:18.300 --> 35:20.333
How would you feel?

35:20.335 --> 35:23.636
Depends
who's watching.

35:23.638 --> 35:27.040
Hey, you may know
these people, but I don't.

35:27.042 --> 35:32.045
Look, all we need you to do
is call Ilana

35:32.047 --> 35:33.579
and have her
meet you at home.

35:33.581 --> 35:36.582
- Hmm.
- You can do that, right?

35:38.385 --> 35:40.720
Consider this
just a regular, old cell phone.

35:42.489 --> 35:45.358
Uh, right, so even more people
are listening in on me.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.928
You can do this.

35:48.930 --> 35:51.264
Look, what if--
what if we're wrong about her?

35:51.266 --> 35:52.598
You think we are?

36:00.341 --> 36:02.909
Here,
I don't need this anymore.

36:21.428 --> 36:23.830
- Hello?
- Ilana, hi. It's Isaac.

36:23.832 --> 36:25.398
Sweetie,
you sound terrible.

36:25.400 --> 36:28.101
We got 'em.

36:28.103 --> 36:30.536
Somebody
just tried to shoot me.

36:30.538 --> 36:32.005
I barely got away.

36:32.007 --> 36:36.309
What? Tell me what happened.
Where are you?

36:36.311 --> 36:39.245
I'm at home.

36:39.247 --> 36:42.882
Too afraid to go out,
to go to work, to do anything.

36:42.884 --> 36:45.318
It's gonna be okay.
I'll be there in an hour.

36:45.320 --> 36:46.519
You're just shaken.

36:46.521 --> 36:49.756
Yeah,
of course I'm shaken.

36:49.758 --> 36:52.191
What kind of country is this
where somebody gets shot at

36:52.193 --> 36:53.426
in the middle of the day,
and nobody even

36:53.428 --> 36:54.627
seems surprised by it?

36:54.629 --> 36:56.396
That's a big question,
Isaac.

36:56.398 --> 36:58.164
We don't have to worry
about that anymore.

36:58.166 --> 37:01.701
I'm not safe here.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.202
We're not safe here.

37:03.204 --> 37:06.806
What if--what if I...

37:06.808 --> 37:08.808
went home?

37:08.810 --> 37:12.712
Ilana, would you come
to America with me?

37:12.714 --> 37:14.180
Ilana,
are you there?

37:14.182 --> 37:15.815
Isaac, I think
you are just in shock.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.918
Please try to stay calm.
I am just an hour away.

37:18.920 --> 37:22.455
Please, I really need
to know this right now.

37:22.457 --> 37:25.958
Would you come back
to New York with me?

37:25.960 --> 37:28.394
Are you--
talk to me, Ilana.

37:32.399 --> 37:35.234
You're here.

38:50.678 --> 38:52.245
You okay?

38:52.247 --> 38:55.581
Yeah, I'm all right.

39:07.661 --> 39:09.629
So you saved my life
twice.

39:09.631 --> 39:11.664
Uh, actually,
I count three times.

39:11.666 --> 39:12.865
Wait a minute.
Are you counting Paris?

39:12.867 --> 39:14.333
Because I saved your life
in Paris.

39:14.335 --> 39:16.502
Okay, maybe we should
stop counting.

39:16.504 --> 39:17.503
You know,
I shouldn't tell you this,

39:17.505 --> 39:19.405
but I wrote you
a good review.

39:19.407 --> 39:20.706
Are you gonna
let me see it?

39:20.708 --> 39:22.575
Not a chance.

39:22.577 --> 39:24.777
But you can see this.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.012
You should know
that Mossad

39:26.014 --> 39:28.247
is not in the business
of sharing information.

39:28.249 --> 39:30.129
And you're sharing it
with me?

39:31.948 --> 39:34.449
Eyal,
what did this cost you?

39:34.474 --> 39:36.474
You don't need
to worry about it.

39:36.992 --> 39:39.626
Thank you.

39:39.628 --> 39:42.562
I hope next time we meet
under happier circumstances.

39:42.564 --> 39:45.265
Well, for people like us,
I don't know how likely that is,

39:45.267 --> 39:48.201
but I'm always
happy to see you.

39:49.838 --> 39:53.273
Always happy
to see you too.

39:53.275 --> 39:54.974
Okay,
I'm gonna go,

39:54.976 --> 39:57.744
and you're gonna disappear into
the wind like you always do.

39:57.746 --> 40:00.280
I always do that?

40:14.728 --> 40:17.263
Hey, Annie!

40:23.103 --> 40:26.973
Be careful.

41:45.453 --> 41:49.656
Hey, Simon,
it's me.

41:49.658 --> 41:52.125
Can I see you?
