WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.839
Come on!

00:04.880 --> 00:07.549
You said I could play.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.056
You have to go

00:14.097 --> 00:15.056
down there again.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.642
No.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.435
Come on, you're the

00:16.684 --> 00:18.435
only one that'll fit.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.311
No.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.521
I always go get it

00:20.562 --> 00:22.356
and you never

00:20.562 --> 00:22.356
let me play.

00:22.397 --> 00:23.649
We'll let you play.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.150
We promise.

00:29.112 --> 00:31.323
Come on, throw it here.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.324
You promised.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.325
No way.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.952
You promised.

00:34.994 --> 00:36.996
The first 50 times he got it,

00:34.994 --> 00:36.996
it was funny.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.121
Then it was just sad.

00:38.163 --> 00:40.081
It's not fair!

00:40.123 --> 00:41.249
It's my turn!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.919
Now it's funny again.

Dad, Francis has to go

01:22.791 --> 01:25.002
back to school tomorrow.

01:25.044 --> 01:27.004
Can't we at least

01:25.044 --> 01:27.004
watch what he wants?

01:27.046 --> 01:28.338
This is educational.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.174
It's a celebration

01:28.380 --> 01:31.174
of the human spirit.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.010
It shows we can

01:31.216 --> 01:33.010
always find

01:33.052 --> 01:34.135
a way to persevere

01:34.177 --> 01:35.846
no matter how many times

01:34.177 --> 01:35.846
we're defeated.

01:35.888 --> 01:37.138
(cartoon music and explosion)

01:37.180 --> 01:38.933
No, don't put on

01:37.180 --> 01:38.933
the rocket skates.

01:38.974 --> 01:40.183
Hal, can I see you

01:38.974 --> 01:40.183
in the bedroom?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.810
Yeah, yeah, just a second,

01:40.225 --> 01:41.810
honey, the coyote...

01:41.852 --> 01:43.062
Hal.

01:47.190 --> 01:49.401
All right,

01:47.190 --> 01:49.401
who did what now?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.820
You did.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.820
I'm two weeks late.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.155
What?

01:54.197 --> 01:56.033
No.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.033
Yes.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.326
Wait... no.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.326
No, you can't be.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.327
You can't be.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.829
We've been

01:59.369 --> 02:00.829
very careful.

02:00.871 --> 02:02.748
How can you let

02:00.871 --> 02:02.748
this happen?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.792
How could I let this happen?!

02:04.833 --> 02:06.460
You're kidding, right?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
I'm just saying,

02:06.501 --> 02:08.211
you're the woman.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.631
What is that supposed to mean?

02:10.672 --> 02:12.800
You know that I can't

02:10.672 --> 02:12.800
be trusted with these things.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.552
I mean, you're the gatekeeper!

02:15.594 --> 02:18.346
LOIS: That is the stupidest

02:15.594 --> 02:18.346
thing you have ever said!

02:18.388 --> 02:19.556
HAL:

02:18.388 --> 02:19.556
Not even close!

02:19.598 --> 02:21.850
How long does it take

02:19.598 --> 02:21.850
to get me a soda, Dewey?

02:21.892 --> 02:23.435
Mom and Dad are fighting.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.770
Really?

02:24.812 --> 02:25.854
Well, don't

02:24.812 --> 02:25.854
worry, chief.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.188
Everything will be fine.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.440
Trust me.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.068
You know what will

02:28.482 --> 02:31.068
take your mind off it?

02:31.110 --> 02:33.236
Making me a sandwich.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.614
HAL: I'm sorry. It's just

02:33.278 --> 02:35.614
that this is upsetting.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.449
LOIS: Well, it's upsetting

02:35.656 --> 02:37.449
for me, too.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.576
You cannot

02:37.491 --> 02:39.576
be pregnant.

02:39.618 --> 02:41.202
We're not ready

02:39.618 --> 02:41.202
for this.

02:41.244 --> 02:44.205
When have we ever been

02:41.244 --> 02:44.205
ready for this, Hal?

02:44.247 --> 02:46.083
(loud groans)

02:49.294 --> 02:51.254
Okay, go ahead.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.007
The blessed state

02:51.296 --> 02:53.007
of matrimony

02:53.048 --> 02:54.133
is a sacred place...

02:54.173 --> 02:55.884
(groaning):

02:54.173 --> 02:55.884
Oh, God!

02:55.926 --> 02:57.803
Maybe we should get

02:55.926 --> 02:57.803
you to the hospital.

02:57.845 --> 03:01.515
No! I will not have our baby

02:57.845 --> 03:01.515
born out of wedlock!

03:01.556 --> 03:03.308
I don't understand why

03:01.556 --> 03:03.308
all of a sudden

03:03.350 --> 03:04.685
you're so

03:03.350 --> 03:04.685
hung up on this.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.061
Up until last week

03:06.103 --> 03:08.229
a marriage certificate

03:06.103 --> 03:08.229
was just a piece of paper.

03:09.648 --> 03:12.233
I changed my mind!

03:12.275 --> 03:16.363
(choking):

03:12.275 --> 03:16.363
And it made me the

03:12.275 --> 03:16.363
happiest man in the world.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.116
(laughing)

03:19.158 --> 03:20.408
Welcome home, Francis.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.242
Yeah.

03:21.284 --> 03:23.244
This place is beautiful.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.287
Oh, thanks.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.873
I can't take any

03:24.329 --> 03:25.873
credit for it.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.166
The decorator

03:25.914 --> 03:27.166
did everything.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.249
Let's see...

03:28.291 --> 03:29.501
Oh, look, just

03:28.291 --> 03:29.501
keep the change.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.627
One second.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.420
One second.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.089
I forgot something.

03:34.131 --> 03:35.298
I am so rattled.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.176
There...

03:37.217 --> 03:38.259
Have a cigar.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.259
It's Cuban.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.553
Thanks.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.553
You're welcome.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.432
Wow!

03:44.474 --> 03:46.267
Hey, Mommy.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.853
(both laughing)

03:47.895 --> 03:50.189
Hal, we have a baby.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.191
Yes, we do.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.237
The baby.

03:59.948 --> 04:01.282
Fragile...

04:01.324 --> 04:02.283
helpless...

04:02.325 --> 04:03.869
little baby.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.870
He's beautiful.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.371
Oh, we're so lucky,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.371
aren't we, Hal?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.456
Huh? Yeah. Lucky.

04:08.498 --> 04:09.917
You think we're going

04:08.498 --> 04:09.917
to be good parents?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.292
You kidding? The best.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.212
Do you think it's going

04:11.334 --> 04:13.212
to change our relationship?

04:13.253 --> 04:14.922
Our what?

04:14.963 --> 04:16.297
No. No.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.507
'Cause we get along so well now,

04:17.549 --> 04:20.301
and everybody says a baby

04:17.549 --> 04:20.301
really changes things.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.722
Oh, I better feed him.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.015
Why?

04:25.057 --> 04:27.768
Frankly, I think

04:25.057 --> 04:27.768
he's getting kind of fat.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.145
Hal, the nurse said I should

04:27.809 --> 04:30.145
feed him every four hours.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.022
Yeah, well, did you get

04:30.187 --> 04:32.022
a look at the nurse?

04:33.065 --> 04:35.567
Hal, where is the baby?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.485
I don't know how

04:35.609 --> 04:37.485
to say this exactly,

04:37.527 --> 04:38.946
but I think the baby's...

04:38.987 --> 04:40.321
(baby cries)

04:40.363 --> 04:41.489
...in the closet!

04:41.531 --> 04:43.033
(nervous laughter)

04:43.075 --> 04:45.410
Whoo!

04:45.452 --> 04:46.411
Here he is.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.579
Perfectly safe.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.331
You put the baby

04:47.621 --> 04:50.331
in the closet?

04:50.373 --> 04:53.252
You left the milk

04:50.373 --> 04:53.252
out on the counter.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.755
Come here, Francis.

05:00.842 --> 05:04.846
I'm never going to let you

05:00.842 --> 05:04.846
out of my sight again.

05:04.888 --> 05:07.808
Hey, Mom, is it okay

05:04.888 --> 05:07.808
if I have the...?

05:07.849 --> 05:09.059
LOIS:

05:07.849 --> 05:09.059
Go away!

05:09.101 --> 05:10.602
All I'm saying is

05:09.101 --> 05:10.602
that you were the one

05:10.644 --> 05:12.729
who wore those

05:10.644 --> 05:12.729
jeans with that rip

05:10.644 --> 05:12.729
above the knee.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.565
Hal, if I got rid of everything

05:12.771 --> 05:15.565
that made you hot and bothered,

05:15.607 --> 05:17.358
I'd be running around

05:15.607 --> 05:17.358
with a handkerchief

05:17.400 --> 05:19.611
and a baseball cap.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.611
Stop it.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.155
What do you want

05:19.653 --> 05:21.155
from me?!

05:21.196 --> 05:22.363
I'm only human.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.242
Oh, please. The minute

05:22.405 --> 05:25.242
you cross that threshold

05:25.284 --> 05:27.995
into the bedroom,

05:25.284 --> 05:27.995
you become more beast than man.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
HAL:

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
Fine, everything

05:28.036 --> 05:30.164
is my fault!

05:30.205 --> 05:33.333
LOIS:

05:30.205 --> 05:33.333
Oh, great. Here come

05:30.205 --> 05:33.333
the waterworks.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.253
Stupid bug.

05:36.295 --> 05:38.255
What's wrong with Mom and Dad?

05:38.297 --> 05:39.256
Aw, just wait.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.300
In an hour they'll be

05:39.298 --> 05:41.300
all lovey-dovey.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.384
It's disgusting.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.595
Stupid bug.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.683
Ow!

05:49.724 --> 05:51.059
You stupid...

05:51.101 --> 05:53.770
Ow! Ow!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.772
Ow! Ow!

05:55.814 --> 05:58.233
God, Reese, give it a rest.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.401
Okay, Francis is down

05:58.275 --> 06:00.401
for his nap.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.987
I emptied the dishwasher,

06:02.029 --> 06:03.655
put another load

06:02.029 --> 06:03.655
in the laundry.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.782
Didn't have time

06:03.697 --> 06:05.782
to scrape the pudding

06:05.824 --> 06:07.201
out of your hair dryer.

06:07.242 --> 06:08.409
Maybe tomorrow.

06:08.451 --> 06:09.536
Bye.

06:12.247 --> 06:14.208
(yells)

06:14.249 --> 06:15.334
When will you be home?

06:15.374 --> 06:17.585
I don't know--

06:15.374 --> 06:17.585
5:00, 6:00... 9:00...

06:17.627 --> 06:18.920
Did you say 9:00?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.797
Honey, I canceled

06:18.962 --> 06:20.797
another appointment

06:20.839 --> 06:21.882
to come home for lunch.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.300
I have to get caught up.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.592
Hal, this is ridiculous.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.427
You're working 14-hour days.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.014
This baby's trying

06:26.469 --> 06:29.014
to beat me to death

06:26.469 --> 06:29.014
from the inside

06:29.056 --> 06:30.431
and Francis

06:29.056 --> 06:30.431
is out of control.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.893
Something has got to change.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.228
Okay, I'll talk to my boss.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.436
Yeah, you said

06:34.269 --> 06:35.436
that before.

06:35.478 --> 06:37.231
Well, yes, and then

06:35.478 --> 06:37.231
the Collins account

06:37.272 --> 06:38.232
was dumped into my lap.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.440
It wasn't a good time.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
Now is better.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.443
Okay?

06:42.485 --> 06:44.071
Love you.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.039
Marty, I have been

06:52.079 --> 06:54.039
the leader in sales

06:54.081 --> 06:56.291
for this company

06:54.081 --> 06:56.291
for five years running.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.918
No one has ever

06:56.333 --> 06:57.918
done that before.

06:57.959 --> 06:59.253
And all

06:57.959 --> 06:59.253
I'm asking

06:59.294 --> 07:01.462
is to cut back

06:59.294 --> 07:01.462
on my hours just

06:59.294 --> 07:01.462
a little tiny bit

07:01.504 --> 07:03.131
so I can help out at home.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.674
You have kids.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.674
You know how it is.

07:04.716 --> 07:06.467
Absolutely, Hal.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.512
Don't worry, we'll find

07:06.509 --> 07:09.512
a way to make this work.

07:12.891 --> 07:13.892
Hey, Hal.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.936
Hey, Phil.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.568
(phone ringing)

07:23.610 --> 07:26.363
Hal... and Supplies.

07:27.530 --> 07:28.740
What?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.700
I trained that guy.

07:30.742 --> 07:33.120
I gave him

07:30.742 --> 07:33.120
half the names

07:30.742 --> 07:33.120
in his Rolodex.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.580
And you know what

07:33.161 --> 07:35.580
he said to me

07:33.161 --> 07:35.580
this morning?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.915
"We need more toner."

07:36.957 --> 07:39.167
And he didn't even

07:36.957 --> 07:39.167
need toner!

07:39.209 --> 07:40.501
Ow!

07:40.543 --> 07:42.170
Another contraction?

07:42.212 --> 07:44.505
No! He's kicking me

07:42.212 --> 07:44.505
in between contractions.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.216
What the hell

07:44.547 --> 07:46.216
is with this kid?

07:46.258 --> 07:47.008
Well, are we

07:47.050 --> 07:48.051
having fun yet?

07:49.136 --> 07:51.388
Okay, let's take a look

07:49.136 --> 07:51.388
in the oven.

07:51.430 --> 07:52.555
Ow!

07:52.597 --> 07:54.015
God!

07:54.057 --> 07:55.183
How far along am I?

07:55.225 --> 07:57.436
'Cause I swear to God,

07:55.225 --> 07:57.436
he's biting my kidney.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.895
You're only

07:57.477 --> 07:58.895
two centimeters dilated.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.106
I think you've got

07:58.937 --> 08:01.106
four or five hours at least.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.732
No.

08:02.774 --> 08:05.360
Honey, the doctor...

08:02.774 --> 08:05.360
No! He is coming out now!

08:05.402 --> 08:06.569
I have had it with this!

08:06.611 --> 08:09.739
You are coming out

08:06.611 --> 08:09.739
right now, mister!

08:12.951 --> 08:14.535
Ah, ah, ah, what

08:12.951 --> 08:14.535
are you doing?

08:15.578 --> 08:17.038
It's not time to push.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.540
You're just going

08:17.080 --> 08:19.540
to prolong your labor.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.543
Oh, great.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.543
Make it a challenge.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.796
Lady, you're just going

08:22.585 --> 08:24.796
to tire yourself out,

08:24.838 --> 08:26.547
and when it comes

08:24.838 --> 08:26.547
time to really push,

08:26.589 --> 08:29.550
you're going

08:26.589 --> 08:29.550
to be exhausted.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.719
Look, all I'm saying is, she can

08:29.592 --> 08:31.719
try to force this all she wants.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.929
It's just not going to...

08:32.971 --> 08:35.556
Oh, my God! Nurse!

08:35.598 --> 08:37.351
(panting)

08:37.392 --> 08:38.726
Okay, honey, you're doing

08:37.392 --> 08:38.726
great, you're doing great.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.854
Just remember to breathe.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.856
Hal... God, do you think

08:40.895 --> 08:42.856
we're really ready

08:42.897 --> 08:43.982
for a second baby?

08:44.024 --> 08:45.942
We're going to have

08:44.024 --> 08:45.942
twice as many kids

08:45.984 --> 08:47.027
and half the money.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.862
What's it going

08:47.068 --> 08:48.862
to do to us?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.571
We-We'll, we'll find a way.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.241
You know, we love

08:50.613 --> 08:53.241
each other.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.617
We-We'll adjust.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.618
We'll make it work.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.246
I mean, they're just kids.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.580
Here he comes.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.790
Ow!

09:00.832 --> 09:03.710
My God, he kicked

09:00.832 --> 09:03.710
me in the nose.

09:04.919 --> 09:06.921
We'll be fine.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.597
What took you so long?

09:16.639 --> 09:18.058
I couldn't very well go

09:16.639 --> 09:18.058
to the Lucky Aide

09:18.099 --> 09:19.267
where you work,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.267
now, could I?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.685
Oh, what, so you drove

09:19.309 --> 09:20.685
clear across town?

09:20.727 --> 09:22.270
Yes, you want to go

09:20.727 --> 09:22.270
over the route I took

09:22.312 --> 09:23.646
so you can

09:22.312 --> 09:23.646
criticize that, too?

09:23.688 --> 09:24.898
Damn. Who's in there?

09:24.939 --> 09:26.607
FRANCIS:

09:24.939 --> 09:26.607
I'm busy.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.608
Backyard.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.486
Are you out of your mind?

09:29.528 --> 09:31.863
Let's go-- I'll let you

09:29.528 --> 09:31.863
choose the most direct route.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.618
Are Mom and Dad

09:35.658 --> 09:37.618
getting a divorce?

09:37.660 --> 09:39.787
What are you

09:37.660 --> 09:39.787
talking about?

09:39.829 --> 09:42.623
They're really

09:39.829 --> 09:42.623
mad at each other.

09:42.665 --> 09:43.833
Don't worry about it.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.419
Everything will be fine.

09:45.460 --> 09:46.627
How do you know?

09:46.669 --> 09:48.463
Look, it used

09:46.669 --> 09:48.463
to scare me, too

09:48.505 --> 09:50.631
but they just have a way

09:48.505 --> 09:50.631
of working things out.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.632
How?

09:51.674 --> 09:53.051
I don't know,

09:51.674 --> 09:53.051
they just do.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.802
But how?

09:54.844 --> 09:57.055
How do I say this

09:54.844 --> 09:57.055
so you'll understand?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.681
Shut up.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.147
Ha, ha!

10:06.189 --> 10:07.941
Does Reese want the bear?

10:07.982 --> 10:11.570
Reese wants the bear,

10:07.982 --> 10:11.570
Reese wants the bear.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.863
This place is so much

10:11.611 --> 10:13.863
smaller than the apartment.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.156
So you keep reminding me.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.575
What choice do

10:15.198 --> 10:16.575
we have, Lois?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.658
Yes,

10:16.616 --> 10:17.658
it is smaller.

10:17.700 --> 10:18.659
And cheaper.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.703
That apartment was

10:18.701 --> 10:20.703
no place to raise children.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
There was nothing

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
there but museums

10:22.705 --> 10:26.251
and nightclubs

10:22.705 --> 10:26.251
and trendy restaurants...

10:26.293 --> 10:28.169
Well, at least

10:26.293 --> 10:28.169
we'll have

10:28.211 --> 10:29.670
a yard to putter

10:28.211 --> 10:29.670
around in, huh?

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
I can't wait to get

10:29.712 --> 10:31.672
my hands on this lawn!

10:31.714 --> 10:32.882
Ow!

10:32.924 --> 10:35.176
Oh, okay, okay,

10:32.924 --> 10:35.176
boys, enough playing.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.928
It's time for Reese's lessons.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.680
What'll it be today,

10:36.970 --> 10:39.680
son, huh?

10:39.722 --> 10:41.182
Russian literature?

10:41.224 --> 10:43.643
Or should we brush up on

10:41.224 --> 10:43.643
the circulatory system, hmm?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.730
Circulatory system it is.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.566
Yeah, great.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.610
Just ignore the eight

10:49.608 --> 10:51.610

got to do this

35 minutes,

11:12.631 --> 11:14.549
three times a day.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.926
All Reese does is sit there.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.553
He's a thinker, Lois.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.722
He's an intensely focused,

11:18.595 --> 11:21.722
peerless thinker.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.350
He's absorbing information.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.726
Studies show that

11:23.391 --> 11:25.726
developing young minds

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
absorb information

11:25.768 --> 11:27.728
at a phenomenal rate.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.356
Hal, he's two years old.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.565
He calls you "phone."

11:30.607 --> 11:32.192
I don't know who

11:30.607 --> 11:32.192
you think this

11:32.233 --> 11:33.692
is helping,

11:32.233 --> 11:33.692
but it's not Reese.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.573
Oh, my God, he just hit

11:36.404 --> 11:38.573
my trigeminal nerve!

11:38.615 --> 11:40.450
(laughing)

11:40.492 --> 11:42.661
We've been working on the

11:40.492 --> 11:42.661
nervous system all morning.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.580
Oh, Hal, will you come

11:42.701 --> 11:45.580
down to reality

11:45.622 --> 11:47.415
long enough

11:45.622 --> 11:47.415
to help me unpack?

11:47.457 --> 11:48.667
Lois, did it ever

11:48.707 --> 11:50.751
cross your mind

11:48.707 --> 11:50.751
that it might be nice

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
to support what I am doing here?

11:52.795 --> 11:54.589
You know, that's

11:52.795 --> 11:54.589
a good question.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.840
What are you doing here?

11:55.882 --> 11:57.217
Because I'll tell you

11:55.882 --> 11:57.217
what you're not doing,

11:57.258 --> 11:58.259
and that's helping!

11:58.301 --> 11:59.802
You know, I think...

12:02.305 --> 12:03.764
...that I should

12:02.305 --> 12:03.764
go for a drive

12:03.806 --> 12:05.724
before I say

12:03.806 --> 12:05.724
something

12:03.806 --> 12:05.724
I'll regret.

Oh, honey...

Oh, sweetheart,

12:15.527 --> 12:17.487
it's okay.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.781
Mommy and Daddy

12:17.529 --> 12:20.781
are just having a tough time.

12:20.823 --> 12:23.076

12:23.117 --> 12:24.869

Oh, oh, no.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.791
Oh, no, not now.

(tires screeching)

12:32.460 --> 12:34.962
Hal!

12:35.004 --> 12:36.631
Okay, we're going

12:35.004 --> 12:36.631
on a little drive,

12:36.673 --> 12:38.799
and Daddy will figure out

12:36.673 --> 12:38.799
where we are eventually,

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
and we'll all be together

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
at the hospital.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.304
I don't need

12:40.843 --> 12:43.304
to go to the hospital.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.431
No, honey, it's for me.

12:44.472 --> 12:46.224
You're lying. You want to

12:44.472 --> 12:46.224
give me a shot.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.809
No, honey, that was last time,

12:46.266 --> 12:48.809
and I already apologized.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.663
to the hospital.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.039
Say you're sorry!

13:10.081 --> 13:11.332
Open the door!

13:11.374 --> 13:12.833
Say you're poopy!

13:12.875 --> 13:15.128
I will not say I'm poopy!

13:15.169 --> 13:16.795
Open that door!

13:18.797 --> 13:20.258
I'm having a baby!

13:20.300 --> 13:21.800
Congratulations!

13:34.939 --> 13:35.940
What's going on?

13:35.982 --> 13:38.025
Your wife just gave birth

13:35.982 --> 13:38.025
on your front lawn.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.027
Congratulations, I guess.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.488
Oh, my Lord!

13:41.529 --> 13:43.323
(stammering)

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
Want the rest

13:48.911 --> 13:51.038
of my Slurpee?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.374
Leave me alone, Hal.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.585
Need any help?

13:55.627 --> 13:57.378
Leave me alone, Hal.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.505
Take this.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.173
Couldn't spring for

13:58.546 --> 14:00.173
the one-minute test.

14:00.214 --> 14:01.466
This one takes five.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.884
Four more minutes we get

14:01.508 --> 14:03.884
to spend together, dear.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.595
Don't take that tone with me.

14:05.637 --> 14:07.472
I'm sorry, this is

14:05.637 --> 14:07.472
the only tone I have.

14:07.514 --> 14:10.057
It's my "I'm panicking

14:07.514 --> 14:10.057
about our future" tone.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.518
How can we afford this?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.311
Have you even

14:11.559 --> 14:13.311
thought about that?

14:13.353 --> 14:15.313
No, I've just been enjoying

14:13.353 --> 14:15.313
peeing in the yard so much,

14:15.355 --> 14:16.773
I haven't thought

14:15.355 --> 14:16.773
about anything!

14:16.815 --> 14:18.191
Another snappy comeback!

14:18.232 --> 14:19.693
That's very helpful!

14:19.734 --> 14:20.985
I'm not being helpful?!

14:21.027 --> 14:22.570
Let me give it

14:21.027 --> 14:22.570
to you straight, Hal!

14:22.612 --> 14:23.904
Why don't you

14:22.612 --> 14:23.904
take that stick

14:23.946 --> 14:25.114
and shove it up your...

14:26.115 --> 14:30.995
(child yelling)

14:31.037 --> 14:33.331
Reese, Reese,

14:31.037 --> 14:33.331
please just sit here

14:33.373 --> 14:35.208
for five minutes,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.208
please, I'm begging you.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.876
Play with this.

14:39.962 --> 14:42.382
Malcolm, would you please

14:39.962 --> 14:42.382
pick up your stuff?

14:42.423 --> 14:43.924
And what is

14:42.423 --> 14:43.924
a four-year-old

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
playing with

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
a microscope

14:43.966 --> 14:45.926
for, anyway?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.137
I see you still haven't

14:45.968 --> 14:48.137
moved the microwave.

14:48.179 --> 14:50.348
As I have pointed out

14:48.179 --> 14:50.348
to you several times,

14:50.390 --> 14:53.017
this is the only socket

14:50.390 --> 14:53.017
in the kitchen that works.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.018
Perhaps we could afford

14:54.060 --> 14:55.770
the extravagance

14:54.060 --> 14:55.770
of an extension cord!

14:55.812 --> 14:57.772
We have extension cords,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.232
but they're all being

14:57.814 --> 14:59.232
used right now

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
to power the space heater

14:59.273 --> 15:01.025
in the bedroom

15:01.067 --> 15:02.360
because somebody gets chills.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.237
Well, perhaps you'd

15:02.402 --> 15:04.237
like to share your bed

15:04.278 --> 15:06.531
with someone who

15:04.278 --> 15:06.531
doesn't get chills.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.658
(doorbell rings)

15:12.203 --> 15:13.454
Hi, Lois.

15:13.496 --> 15:15.039
What did he do this time?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.791
He took a joyride

15:15.081 --> 15:16.791
in a street cleaner.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.877
Get in here.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.877
Francis.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.169
Here's the summons.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.962
Your juvenile court date's

15:20.211 --> 15:21.962
on the 12th,

15:22.004 --> 15:23.464
and, well,

15:22.004 --> 15:23.464
you know the drill.

15:23.506 --> 15:24.924
Thank you, Officer.

15:28.010 --> 15:28.969
They caught you

15:29.011 --> 15:30.179
on a street cleaner?

15:30.221 --> 15:31.806
What were you thinking?

15:31.848 --> 15:33.182
That it went faster.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.434
Go to your room.

15:34.475 --> 15:35.976
Are you happy now?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
Me? How is this my fault?

15:38.521 --> 15:40.022
You are always

15:38.521 --> 15:40.022
regaling him

15:40.064 --> 15:41.399
with tales of

15:40.064 --> 15:41.399
your wild youth.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.818
Those are cautionary tales.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.818
(glass shattering)

15:43.860 --> 15:45.403
Cautionary tales

15:43.860 --> 15:45.403
do not end with

15:45.445 --> 15:47.405
"It was so cool."

15:45.445 --> 15:47.405
Mom,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.824
I think I broke

15:47.447 --> 15:49.824
my chemistry set.

15:49.866 --> 15:50.700
In a second, Malcolm.

15:50.742 --> 15:51.868
All right,

15:50.742 --> 15:51.868
do me a favor, Lois.

15:51.910 --> 15:54.621
Make me a list of pre-approved

15:51.910 --> 15:54.621
childhood memories

15:54.662 --> 15:56.790
so I know what I can

15:54.662 --> 15:56.790
and what I can't

15:56.831 --> 15:57.998
share with the boys.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.084
(muffled yelling)

16:00.126 --> 16:01.836
Oh, for God's sake,

16:00.126 --> 16:01.836
hold still.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.088
Hal, that's not

16:02.962 --> 16:04.088
going to work.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.006
Just drive him

16:04.130 --> 16:06.006
to the emergency room.

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
We do not need to go

16:06.048 --> 16:08.008
to the emergency room. Ah.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
Mom!

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
Hal, you're

16:08.050 --> 16:09.677
forcing it

16:09.719 --> 16:12.305
further in his mouth, and

16:09.719 --> 16:12.305
he's going to choke to death!

16:12.346 --> 16:13.640
For once will you stop

16:13.681 --> 16:15.850
telling me how wrong I am?

16:15.892 --> 16:18.018
And will you stop

16:15.892 --> 16:18.018
telling me what to do?

16:18.060 --> 16:19.479
(coughing)

16:19.520 --> 16:21.021
What the...

16:21.063 --> 16:23.023
I tried to make invisible ink,

16:23.065 --> 16:25.109
but I think I made chlorine gas.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.486
Come on, everybody out!

16:26.527 --> 16:28.028
Out, out, out, out,

16:26.527 --> 16:28.028
now, come on, out!

16:28.070 --> 16:29.029
LOIS:

16:28.070 --> 16:29.029
Go!

16:29.071 --> 16:30.990
(all coughing)

16:32.909 --> 16:35.286
Okay, we all here?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.246
Okay, good.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.246
We're fine.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.040
We'll just let the

16:37.288 --> 16:40.040
house air out, and...

16:40.082 --> 16:42.209
(thunder cracks)

16:42.251 --> 16:44.921
Rain, yay!

16:42.251 --> 16:44.921
Yay!

16:48.382 --> 16:51.218
Okay, let's hear it!

16:51.260 --> 16:54.555
This has got to be

16:51.260 --> 16:54.555
my fault somehow.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.974
So go ahead.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.057
Say it, come on!

16:57.099 --> 17:01.479
I'm the cause of all

16:57.099 --> 17:01.479
that is bad in the universe!

17:01.521 --> 17:04.983
Everything that I touch

17:01.521 --> 17:04.983
turns to crap!

17:05.024 --> 17:08.486
And now I bring you rain!

17:08.528 --> 17:10.989
Oh, you'll feel better

17:11.030 --> 17:13.073
once you get it

17:11.030 --> 17:13.073
out in the open, Lois!

17:13.115 --> 17:14.241
Come on!

17:14.283 --> 17:17.996
I'm having the baby.

17:22.124 --> 17:26.671
Oh, well, that's good

17:26.713 --> 17:30.925
because the car keys

17:26.713 --> 17:30.925
are inside the house.

17:30.967 --> 17:33.093
So, I can either suffocate

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
by going back in there

17:33.135 --> 17:34.679
to get them

17:34.721 --> 17:36.806
or you can have another baby

17:34.721 --> 17:36.806
out here on the lawn!

17:36.848 --> 17:38.182
Try the azaleas!

17:38.224 --> 17:40.059
Maybe they'll finally bloom!

17:41.185 --> 17:42.937
(moaning)

17:42.979 --> 17:45.732
(boys yelling)

17:53.197 --> 17:56.325
We can't do this!

17:58.160 --> 18:00.705
We are not having a baby

17:58.160 --> 18:00.705
with us like this.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.833
We have to figure out

18:00.747 --> 18:03.833
a way to fix this.

18:03.875 --> 18:05.752
Well, I guess I can get

18:03.875 --> 18:05.752
a night job, and...

18:05.793 --> 18:09.129
No, we have to figure out

18:05.793 --> 18:09.129
a way to fix us.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.424
And I don't mean just now

18:11.465 --> 18:13.593
because we're always going

18:11.465 --> 18:13.593
to have hard times.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.803
We have to figure out a way

18:13.634 --> 18:15.803
to get through this

18:15.845 --> 18:17.137
without us killing

18:15.845 --> 18:17.137
each other.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.057
Well, I'm open to suggestions.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.145
Okay, here's what

18:22.602 --> 18:25.145
we're going to do.

18:25.187 --> 18:29.149
You're going to tell me

18:25.187 --> 18:29.149
three-- no, five-- no, seven!

18:29.191 --> 18:34.154
I want you to tell me

18:29.191 --> 18:34.154
seven things you love about me.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.617
Seven reasons why

18:34.196 --> 18:37.617
this is all worthwhile.

18:37.658 --> 18:40.160
Seven reasons why

18:37.658 --> 18:40.160
we're still here.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.081
Seven?

18:43.122 --> 18:45.249
Seven. And I have to

18:43.122 --> 18:45.249
believe every one of them

18:45.291 --> 18:47.167
and you have to say

18:45.291 --> 18:47.167
them all right now.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.168
Seven?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.670
Oh, just please.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.964
Just do it.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.964
Okay, okay, okay.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.090
Okay, okay, okay, uh...

18:52.131 --> 18:54.675
I, I-I-I love,

18:54.717 --> 18:58.178
I love how your neck

18:54.717 --> 18:58.178
smells in the morning.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.472
Okay.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.140
That's one.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.770
I love how every one

19:03.225 --> 19:05.770
of your toes

19:05.812 --> 19:08.022
looks like it came from

19:05.812 --> 19:08.022
another person's foot.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.649
Oh, God.

19:09.690 --> 19:13.193
And-And-And I love how you're

19:09.690 --> 19:13.193
honest and-and fearless

19:13.235 --> 19:17.115
and, and how when I'm sick

19:13.235 --> 19:17.115
you treat me like a baby.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.701
Okay, that last one

19:18.324 --> 19:20.701
counts for two.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.244
You got three more to go.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.955
Okay.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.919
I can tell you

19:26.082 --> 19:29.919
that I just adore this.

19:31.045 --> 19:32.421
The way your forehead

19:31.045 --> 19:32.421
gets all crinkly

19:32.463 --> 19:34.214
when you're worried.

19:34.256 --> 19:37.510
And I love the way you cut

19:34.256 --> 19:37.510
your crust off your toast

19:37.551 --> 19:39.512
even though you end up

19:37.551 --> 19:39.512
eating both anyway.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.724
I love your loyalty

19:39.553 --> 19:43.724
and your kindness

19:43.766 --> 19:45.810
and that you still

19:43.766 --> 19:45.810
suck in your gut

19:45.852 --> 19:47.311
whenever I walk

19:45.852 --> 19:47.311
into the room.

19:47.353 --> 19:48.437
(laughing)

19:48.479 --> 19:50.064
I love how you

19:48.479 --> 19:50.064
didn't dump me

19:50.106 --> 19:51.732
when you found out that

19:50.106 --> 19:51.732
I was in love with you.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.234
I love that you

19:51.774 --> 19:54.234
still married me

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
even after you

19:54.276 --> 19:56.236
met my parents.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.073
(laughing)

19:59.115 --> 20:00.700
And I love that

19:59.115 --> 20:00.700
nothing in my life--

20:00.741 --> 20:04.244
not cribbage with my dad,

20:04.286 --> 20:07.247
not a... a new

20:04.286 --> 20:07.247
Van Halen album--

20:07.289 --> 20:09.834
not even an old Van Halen

20:07.289 --> 20:09.834
album, for that matter,

20:09.876 --> 20:11.251
or any of their

20:09.876 --> 20:11.251
solo albums...

20:11.293 --> 20:12.419
Hal, Hal.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.882
I love that nothing

20:12.461 --> 20:15.882
in my life is complete

20:15.923 --> 20:18.009
until I've shared

20:15.923 --> 20:18.009
it with you.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.470
(boys yelling)

20:33.024 --> 20:36.944
I love how you send

20:33.024 --> 20:36.944
the boys to their room

20:36.986 --> 20:39.279
just so we can have

20:36.986 --> 20:39.279
some alone time.

20:39.321 --> 20:41.741
I just love you.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.911
♪ ♪

20:47.329 --> 20:48.622
That's my sandwich.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.250
(both yelling)

20:54.336 --> 20:56.964
(all yelling)

21:02.261 --> 21:04.805
You know, I wouldn't give

21:02.261 --> 21:04.805
up a single one of them.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.515
They're our boys.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.392
No one else

21:06.557 --> 21:08.392
can say that.

21:08.434 --> 21:11.604
They're our boys.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.022
Negative.

21:13.064 --> 21:15.274
All that worry

21:13.064 --> 21:15.274
for nothing.

21:16.358 --> 21:17.944
A girl would have

21:16.358 --> 21:17.944
been nice, though.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.195
Are you kidding?

21:19.237 --> 21:21.030
We've got you outnumbered

21:19.237 --> 21:21.030
five to one now

21:21.072 --> 21:22.865
and we're still losing.

21:35.377 --> 21:39.006
Boys, go to your room!
