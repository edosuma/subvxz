you guys.</i>

00:27.152 --> 00:29.052
<i>Okay, can we just, like,
can we go home now?</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:31.570
- No. I wanna do one more.
- This is the last one.

00:31.659 --> 00:33.159
Yeah. Let's do the last maze.

00:39.938 --> 00:43.441
I don't know why you're so freaked
out, you're with us, don't worry.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.190
This better be worth it.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.992
Okay, just stay
in front of me. You go first.

01:26.457 --> 01:28.328
That thing
is so cheesy.

02:12.144 --> 02:15.248
You guys, it's a dead... End.

02:15.615 --> 02:17.017
Seriously?

02:17.651 --> 02:18.750
It's not funny.

02:42.113 --> 02:45.380
<i>Enter if you dare.</i>

03:10.211 --> 03:12.415
Great. It's a dead end.

03:15.184 --> 03:17.518
Shit. Another scare?

03:23.227 --> 03:24.261
Wait.

03:26.764 --> 03:28.831
You're the one that's been following
me all night, aren't you?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.472
Okay, stop!

03:34.474 --> 03:37.143
I'm scared, okay?
Is that what you wanna hear?

03:37.643 --> 03:39.278
Now, leave me alone.

04:47.291 --> 04:48.794
Thank you so much.

05:02.709 --> 05:04.576
Nat? Oh, my God!

05:04.578 --> 05:06.011
What? You're here!

05:06.013 --> 05:07.679
What? Oh, my God!

05:07.681 --> 05:10.916
- How are you?
- I'm good! How are you?

05:10.918 --> 05:12.853
- I'm good.
- Yeah.

05:12.855 --> 05:15.623
- Yay.
- Wow, why is she here?

05:15.625 --> 05:17.624
Well, hello, Grade School.

05:17.626 --> 05:19.229
It's good to see you.
How's life?

05:21.465 --> 05:23.031
- It's great.
- Mmm.

05:23.033 --> 05:24.699
Yeah. Why are you here?

05:24.701 --> 05:25.934
Oh, she didn't tell you?

05:25.936 --> 05:28.404
Dude, I live here now.
It's awesome, right?

05:28.406 --> 05:29.539
I'm so glad you're here.

05:29.541 --> 05:32.474
I was just telling Taylor
how I hoped you'd make it.

05:32.476 --> 05:33.843
Such a surprise!

05:33.845 --> 05:34.978
Huge surprise.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.680
Why?

05:36.682 --> 05:38.014
Why is it surprising?

05:38.016 --> 05:40.084
Well, I mean,
just last time we talked,

05:40.086 --> 05:41.952
you said you were studying.
So I didn't know if...

05:41.954 --> 05:43.322
Studying?

05:43.324 --> 05:44.690
Dude, it's October,
it is fun time.

05:44.692 --> 05:45.991
You save that for December.

05:45.993 --> 05:47.859
Well, some of us have
scholarships, Taylor.

05:47.861 --> 05:49.429
- Kinda need to keep mine.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:49.431 --> 05:50.830
You kinda need to get laid.

05:50.832 --> 05:52.800
Brooke, your bestie needs
to get some,

05:52.802 --> 05:55.468
and lucky for her,
Gavin's coming tonight!

05:55.470 --> 05:57.505
You remember Gavin.
Brook already told me

05:57.507 --> 05:59.606
you've wanted
to ride that D

05:59.608 --> 06:01.042
since you first
laid eyes on him.

06:01.044 --> 06:03.313
- Wow.
- Yeah. See, I listen.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.381
I really wish you didn't.

06:06.383 --> 06:08.983
"Ride that D," huh?

06:08.985 --> 06:12.356
Her, of all people?
God, she's never liked me.

06:12.358 --> 06:13.923
I don't know why you would
tell her about Gavin.

06:13.925 --> 06:15.763
Hey, can't stay mad.

06:17.530 --> 06:18.895
Can't stay mad.

06:18.897 --> 06:19.896
Ugh!

06:19.898 --> 06:21.767
She calls me "Grade School,"
for God's sake.

06:21.769 --> 06:23.868
- I think it's endearing.
- No! It's not endearing.

06:23.870 --> 06:24.969
It's bitchy, maybe.

06:24.971 --> 06:26.404
No, it's not.

06:26.406 --> 06:27.876
Look, she's not replacing you.

06:29.077 --> 06:31.111
Nothing could ever
replace you, okay?

06:31.113 --> 06:33.413
Please tell me I don't have to
hang out with her all weekend.

06:33.415 --> 06:36.684
Uh... Tonight she's coming,
but that's it.

06:36.686 --> 06:37.951
And then, it's just
you and me. Promise.

06:37.953 --> 06:39.323
Unless...

06:40.156 --> 06:41.489
Unless what?

06:41.491 --> 06:44.058
Unless, you know,
you and Gavin

06:44.060 --> 06:45.727
want some alone time
this weekend.

06:45.729 --> 06:48.131
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing, I promise!

06:48.133 --> 06:50.932
He's just the one that got us
the VIP passes to Hell Fest.

06:50.934 --> 06:52.002
What is that?

06:52.004 --> 06:53.904
Dude, it's so
fucking dope! Okay?

06:53.906 --> 06:55.606
Like, it's a traveling
horror night.

06:55.608 --> 06:57.475
People totally lose their shit
in there. It's really fun.

06:57.477 --> 06:58.742
You're not
selling me on it.

06:58.744 --> 07:00.477
No, it's great!
It's gonna be fun!

07:00.479 --> 07:02.112
Tickets sold out
the minute they went on sale.

07:02.114 --> 07:05.483
But your boy Gavin came through
and got some tickets for us.

07:05.485 --> 07:06.918
Okay, we don't need
to do this dance now.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.923
And he's been
asking about you.

07:09.925 --> 07:11.058
- Really?
- He was like...

07:11.060 --> 07:14.828
"Hey, Brooke, is your hot
friend coming this weekend?"

07:14.830 --> 07:16.196
Wait, he called me hot?

07:16.198 --> 07:18.699
Apparently, someone made
a great impression on him

07:18.701 --> 07:19.833
this past summer.

07:19.835 --> 07:20.901
Why is that surprising?

07:22.106 --> 07:24.139
He was like,
"Hey Brooke, uh...

07:24.141 --> 07:25.007
"You know, I should get

07:25.009 --> 07:26.575
"an extra ticket
for Natalie, right?

07:26.577 --> 07:28.076
"She's coming.
She's coming, right?"

07:28.078 --> 07:29.446
"Hey, Brooke,
I know this is, like,

07:29.448 --> 07:30.914
"really awkward and shit.
But, like,

07:30.916 --> 07:32.881
"do you think that
after Hell Fest,

07:32.883 --> 07:34.985
"Natalie will sit on my face?"

07:34.987 --> 07:36.757
Shut up, he did not say that!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.224
- Did he?
- I don't know!

07:40.226 --> 07:41.926
But, um...

07:41.928 --> 07:44.696
You're not wearing
that, right?

07:44.698 --> 07:46.165
Why? What is wrong
with what I'm wearing?

07:46.167 --> 07:47.800
Nat, it's Halloween!

07:47.802 --> 07:49.468
It's the one night
out of the year

07:49.470 --> 07:52.205
you're allowed to let out
your inner slut.

07:52.207 --> 07:53.739
Yeah, I don't think
I have one of those.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.842
Hey, babe... Oh. Whoa.

07:55.844 --> 07:57.845
Natalie!

07:57.847 --> 08:00.648
- I didn't think you were gonna make it.
- Can you knock?

08:00.650 --> 08:01.848
Hi! Yeah, no, I'm here.

08:01.850 --> 08:03.618
I don't know why everyone
thinks I'm not gonna be here.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.120
What? No. I knew
you were coming.

08:05.122 --> 08:06.889
Brooke was the one
who was like, "It's iffy."

08:06.891 --> 08:08.524
Can you not do that?

08:08.526 --> 08:09.725
- What are you in here for?
- I'm just... I'm ready.

08:09.727 --> 08:10.960
You guys ready?
You ready for Hell Fest?

08:10.962 --> 08:12.862
- You look ready.
- Baby, we need 10 minutes.

08:12.864 --> 08:14.965
We have to meet Gavin at will call.
We're gonna be late.

08:14.967 --> 08:18.569
Babe, you gotta go.
I need 10 minutes.

08:18.571 --> 08:20.137
- Okay. I'll see you in 30.
- See you in a bit.

08:20.139 --> 08:22.241
- Love you.
- Okay, so...

08:22.243 --> 08:24.176
We need to find you
something good.

08:24.178 --> 08:26.143
And make up for lost time.

08:26.145 --> 08:27.212
This is dope!

08:27.214 --> 08:28.280
Oh, my God!
This is awesome, guys!

08:28.282 --> 08:30.148
- I know!
- It's gonna be fun!

08:30.150 --> 08:32.683
Nat, don't worry! I will totally
protect you from being murdered.

08:32.686 --> 08:34.654
Oh, thanks. I didn't realize
that was a possibility, but...

08:34.655 --> 08:36.121
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.258
Do not be flippant.

08:37.260 --> 08:39.626
It happens,
like in Orange Grove.

08:39.629 --> 08:41.128
Oh, yeah, that was
fucked up.

08:41.130 --> 08:42.264
Wait, what?

08:42.265 --> 08:43.998
Oh, well, a couple
years ago,

08:44.000 --> 08:46.234
a girl got completely gutted

08:46.236 --> 08:47.369
in a haunted house,
like, for real.

08:47.371 --> 08:49.771
The killer left her body
in the park for three days.

08:49.773 --> 08:51.707
No one found her
until she started to stink.

08:51.709 --> 08:53.143
They thought she was
a freaking prop!

08:53.145 --> 08:54.811
- Wait, that's brutal!
- Man, what can I say?

08:54.813 --> 08:56.079
Some people are just evil.

08:56.081 --> 08:57.948
I mean, they're monsters.

08:57.950 --> 09:00.652
To them, every single day
is Halloween

09:00.654 --> 09:02.689
and they dress up,
so that we don't know.

09:03.623 --> 09:05.124
Know what?

09:05.126 --> 09:06.858
That they walk among us.

09:06.860 --> 09:07.760
Nat, they're fucking
with you!

09:07.762 --> 09:09.160
- Okay, dude...
- Are we?

09:09.162 --> 09:10.463
Oh, yes, you are!

09:10.465 --> 09:12.565
- Okay, murder twins, we get it. It's scary.
- I know.

09:12.567 --> 09:13.632
Whatever.

09:13.634 --> 09:14.733
- Oh, my God!
- Quinn!

09:14.735 --> 09:16.304
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

09:16.306 --> 09:18.204
Hell Fest! Hell Fest!

09:18.206 --> 09:20.206
Yes, I'm excited.
Okay, let's go, let's go.

09:20.208 --> 09:23.912
<i>I'm so excited! Yes!</i>

09:23.914 --> 09:25.616
Hey, murder twins,
wait up!

09:27.050 --> 09:28.684
<i>Welcome to Hell Fest!</i>

09:28.686 --> 09:31.187
All right. Let's go.

09:31.189 --> 09:33.323
<i>Beyond these gates,</i>

09:33.325 --> 09:37.595
<i>your inner fears
will come true!</i>

09:41.634 --> 09:44.603
Whoa. Is that her?

09:44.605 --> 09:46.638
- Asher's here?
- Yeah. Come on.

09:46.640 --> 09:48.139
Oh, yeah.

09:48.141 --> 09:49.642
You might actually
have to pretend

09:49.644 --> 09:51.648
- you have game tonight.
- Asher!

09:52.615 --> 09:53.480
Hey, boo.

09:53.482 --> 09:54.981
Asher, this is Natalie.
Natalie, Asher.

09:54.983 --> 09:56.017
- Hello, pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:56.019 --> 09:57.217
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

09:57.219 --> 09:59.620
- Hey. It's been a while.
- Hey.

09:59.622 --> 10:01.322
You look great.
It's good to see you.

10:01.324 --> 10:04.092
- Hell Fest!
- Welcome to VIP, bitches!

10:04.094 --> 10:07.328
VIP, bitches!

10:07.330 --> 10:09.265
There you go.
I can help you put yours on.

10:09.267 --> 10:10.532
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:10.534 --> 10:13.203
Thanks. Yeah, Brooke tells me
I have you to thank for this.

10:13.205 --> 10:15.104
- So...
- Yeah, no. No problem.

10:15.106 --> 10:17.407
- Thank you.
- No problem.

10:17.409 --> 10:19.777
No, she said you were
coming to town, so I just...

10:19.779 --> 10:21.112
I wanted us to do
something fun.

10:21.114 --> 10:22.681
Great.

10:22.683 --> 10:24.416
- Hey, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

10:24.418 --> 10:25.783
You guys ready?

10:25.959 --> 10:27.052
Hell Fest, guys!
Let's do this!

10:29.879 --> 10:31.539
Hell Fest!

10:44.727 --> 10:47.092
Look it, work it
for me, baby! Work it!

10:50.777 --> 10:52.313
Oh, shit! Okay!

10:56.689 --> 10:57.789
Hey!

10:57.791 --> 10:58.923
Oh, shit!

11:02.953 --> 11:04.353
Good Lord!

11:04.414 --> 11:05.414
Wow!

11:06.250 --> 11:07.410
And then there's that.

11:07.420 --> 11:09.454
And then there's that.

11:09.670 --> 11:13.003
So, just so you guys know,
fear is an aphrodisiac.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.339
Yeah, it stimulates
something...

11:14.341 --> 11:16.877
- The more you know.
- Deep in those lizard brains

11:16.879 --> 11:18.112
and it reminds you
that life is short

11:18.114 --> 11:22.116
and an organism's only true
purpose is to, uh, reproduce.

11:22.118 --> 11:23.652
Okay. That's great.
Thank you.

11:23.654 --> 11:27.054
It is. All right, I will let you guys
think about that and I'll be back later.

11:27.056 --> 11:29.192
All right.
Thanks for the master class.

11:29.194 --> 11:30.960
You're welcome!

11:30.962 --> 11:32.428
I'm starting to get
the feeling our friends think

11:32.430 --> 11:34.330
something's gonna happen
between us.

11:34.332 --> 11:35.899
Really? No, I didn't
notice that at all.

11:35.901 --> 11:37.000
- Oh, really?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:37.002 --> 11:38.102
You don't get
that vibe at all?

11:38.104 --> 11:39.170
- No, I don't.
- It's very subtle.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.338
Just you're picking up
on that.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.373
Yeah, it's just me.

11:42.375 --> 11:45.911
Hey, well, I'm actually...
I'm glad you came.

11:45.913 --> 11:47.079
I think it's gonna be fun.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.447
It's been a while
since we've hung out.

11:49.449 --> 11:51.050
Yeah, I was bummed
that I had to bail.

11:51.052 --> 11:52.318
I just had a bunch of shit
that I...

11:52.320 --> 11:55.355
Jesus Christ!
That came so close to my face!

11:55.357 --> 11:56.856
No!

11:56.858 --> 11:58.394
You're good, this is it.

11:59.094 --> 12:00.761
It's not that bad.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.896
- It's just...
- Not the worst thing, I guess?

12:04.301 --> 12:07.002
- It is time for shots!
- Shots!

12:07.004 --> 12:08.237
- Yes!
- Shots!

12:08.239 --> 12:10.172
Please, let's go!
Come on!

12:47.083 --> 12:48.386
Raise your arms.

12:55.194 --> 12:56.262
You're good.

13:14.216 --> 13:15.919
Why do you always
switch them?

13:16.485 --> 13:17.451
Thanks, man.

13:17.453 --> 13:19.890
Asher! Hurry up
with those shots!

13:21.090 --> 13:23.357
- Whoa. Shots!
- Yeah!

13:23.359 --> 13:25.125
Nice! So we got VIP tonight,

13:25.127 --> 13:27.163
so lines aren't gonna be
an issue. We are here,

13:27.165 --> 13:28.463
but we need
to focus our shit,

13:28.465 --> 13:29.598
'cause I'm trying to hit
everything tonight.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.867
Let's do the Zombie Maze.

13:30.869 --> 13:31.934
- Boom.
- Why?

13:31.936 --> 13:33.402
Yo, Gav, what are you, five?

13:33.404 --> 13:34.604
We didn't come here for slow.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.106
If you want that,
go trick-or-treating.

13:36.108 --> 13:37.641
We came here to be terrified!

13:37.643 --> 13:39.944
The Zombie Maze
is fucking scary, it's...

13:39.946 --> 13:41.245
I'm good with the
Zombie Maze. I am.

13:41.247 --> 13:43.013
No, I wanna do Deform School

13:43.015 --> 13:44.415
because I've been
a very naughty girl.

13:44.417 --> 13:46.051
And I hear Deform School
is one of the scariest mazes

13:46.053 --> 13:47.586
outside of the Deadlands.

13:47.588 --> 13:49.388
- Wait, what are the Deadlands?
- What?

13:49.390 --> 13:51.024
No, it's a part of the park

13:51.026 --> 13:53.360
where they can all touch you
or something. Right?

13:53.362 --> 13:55.127
Wait. For real,
they can touch you?

13:55.129 --> 13:56.596
Yeah. That's where shit's
gonna get crazy.

13:56.598 --> 13:58.098
Sounds fun, right?

13:58.100 --> 13:59.900
Plus, it's the only way
you get to go into Hell

13:59.902 --> 14:02.205
which is the scariest maze,
so...

14:05.009 --> 14:06.108
Yeah?

14:06.110 --> 14:07.441
Please?

14:09.079 --> 14:10.148
Come on.

14:11.049 --> 14:13.649
Sure.

14:13.651 --> 14:16.021
- To Hell Fest!
- To Hell Fest!

14:35.009 --> 14:36.642
Oh, my God!
Dude, you don't scare me!

14:36.644 --> 14:37.646
Go back to the other freaks!

15:06.080 --> 15:07.646
I just wanna go back home...

15:09.317 --> 15:11.484
What is up with
all these assholes?

15:11.486 --> 15:14.119
You think you're scaring me?
Ooh, you're so scary.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.556
No. Move.

15:45.225 --> 15:46.524
Wait! You guys,
what the fuck?

15:46.526 --> 15:47.659
Come on, come on!

15:47.661 --> 15:49.093
You don't
have to run, like...

15:49.095 --> 15:50.428
- I don't like being fast.
- I don't like being...

15:50.430 --> 15:52.031
- I don't like that. At all.
- I can't see anything.

15:52.033 --> 15:54.134
Okay, we can do this.
It's okay, we got this.

15:54.136 --> 15:55.501
Fuck this shit!

15:55.503 --> 15:57.338
Oh, my God!

15:57.340 --> 15:58.638
Okay. Hi,
thank you very much!

15:58.640 --> 16:00.107
Oh, my God!
Holy shit.

16:00.109 --> 16:02.609
- Brooke! Okay, okay...
- Go, go, go!

16:03.780 --> 16:05.580
Oh, my God!
It's everywhere!

16:05.582 --> 16:06.647
That was so stupid!

16:06.649 --> 16:08.115
Picture,
picture, picture!

16:08.117 --> 16:09.751
He got her
more than me. Thank God.

16:09.753 --> 16:10.820
Let's go.

16:10.822 --> 16:12.754
Cobwebs.
You go, you walk first.

16:12.756 --> 16:13.956
Dude, the more scared
you seem,

16:13.958 --> 16:15.625
the more they're gonna come
after you. You gotta like...

16:15.627 --> 16:16.726
- You have to play it cool.
- Just relax and...

16:16.728 --> 16:18.395
Yes. You... Shit!

16:18.397 --> 16:19.696
Oh, my God!

16:19.698 --> 16:21.698
Yeah, no, just play it cool.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.666
I'll remember that.
That's great.

16:22.668 --> 16:25.303
No, that...
I have a very specific phobia

16:25.305 --> 16:26.538
of demon clowns.

16:26.540 --> 16:28.174
These are my people.

16:28.176 --> 16:29.608
Jesus Christ.

16:29.610 --> 16:31.109
Come on,
come on, come on!

16:31.111 --> 16:32.210
VIP!

16:32.212 --> 16:33.549
Sucks to be you.

16:35.150 --> 16:37.850
Okay, I'm sorry.
VIP band, just showed it off.

16:37.852 --> 16:40.123
Tay, they pace it out
so we each go on our own.

16:41.657 --> 16:44.091
Oh, can we go? Can we go?

16:44.093 --> 16:46.462
And, wait, wait.

16:46.464 --> 16:47.799
- Go, go, go!
- Thank you!

16:49.233 --> 16:51.101
Okay. Are you ready?

16:51.103 --> 16:52.367
- Yeah.
- You that ready?

16:52.369 --> 16:53.371
Yep, I'm ready.

16:56.441 --> 16:57.644
Go, go, go!

17:04.484 --> 17:06.317
See? I didn't need that
in my life.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.385
Don't do that! Oh, my God!

17:08.387 --> 17:10.355
You know what? He deserves
at least some dignity in death.

17:10.357 --> 17:11.891
- Let's give him a boner.
- Definitely.

17:11.893 --> 17:13.526
Oh, God!
The last thing I need to do

17:13.528 --> 17:14.660
is relive high school.

17:14.662 --> 17:16.430
She can keep me after class.

17:16.432 --> 17:18.330
Ow! Hey, Gavin.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.598
You like paddles, right?
You said you had a fetish

17:19.601 --> 17:21.234
or something.
She's got a paddle.

17:21.237 --> 17:22.669
I've never said that
in my entire life.

17:22.671 --> 17:24.338
Oh, freaky.

17:24.339 --> 17:25.906
I don't like paddles.
They're fucking with you.

17:25.907 --> 17:27.342
I mean,
if you do, man.

17:27.344 --> 17:28.476
- I never...
- You don't like paddles?

17:28.478 --> 17:29.778
- You're such an asshole.
- Hey, guys.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.481
I don't think everyone here
is completely dead.

17:32.483 --> 17:36.218
I mean, part of this guy
is very much alive.

17:37.256 --> 17:38.588
Are you sexually harassing
a zombie right now?

17:38.590 --> 17:40.624
Because I feel like
that's just a lot.

17:40.626 --> 17:41.626
Look, all I know is

17:41.628 --> 17:43.694
I definitely know
how to make the dead rise.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.898
You know how
to make everything rise, baby.

17:45.900 --> 17:47.498
- I guess we're going that way.
- We're going that way.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.200
We're supposed
to follow that?

17:54.608 --> 17:55.677
Oh.

17:58.881 --> 17:59.947
Hurry up!

17:59.949 --> 18:01.248
I'm trying. Hold on.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.482
Oh, shit!

18:02.484 --> 18:04.318
Oh. All right. No.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.555
Ruined the damn photo.

18:07.324 --> 18:08.626
I'm scared.

18:10.595 --> 18:13.261
Oh, God! One of these guys
has gotta be real.

18:13.263 --> 18:15.432
- Oh, yeah!
- Yep.

18:17.503 --> 18:19.569
If you could
go first, that'd be great.

18:19.571 --> 18:20.636
This...

18:22.708 --> 18:25.342
- Okay, you have to look at their hands.
- Why?

18:25.344 --> 18:26.578
Then you can tell
which one is real,

18:26.580 --> 18:27.879
if you look at their hands.

18:27.881 --> 18:29.048
Okay, but I don't like
looking at the hands,

18:29.050 --> 18:32.417
because then you can't see
their skin and their faces.

18:32.419 --> 18:34.821
- Yeah, that's the one.
- There you go.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.456
Busted, sir. Or, ma'am.
I can't really tell.

18:37.458 --> 18:39.326
How dare you assume?

18:39.328 --> 18:41.928
I don't know, honestly.
They're all kind of...

18:41.930 --> 18:43.264
Neutral.

18:43.266 --> 18:44.833
Oh, hey.

18:44.835 --> 18:45.968
This place is
kind of lame.

18:45.970 --> 18:47.502
- Yeah, bummer.
- I like all the art...

18:48.771 --> 18:51.176
Fuck! Come on!

18:53.744 --> 18:55.313
Nope! Okay, go!

19:13.001 --> 19:14.901
- Did they just ditch us?
- What the fuck?

19:14.903 --> 19:16.806
- Oh, my God!
- Of course they did. Wait.

19:17.606 --> 19:19.673
Wait.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.842
Wait, wait.
Don't you spill my tequila.

19:21.844 --> 19:23.310
Wait, no, no, no!
I just figured it out.

19:23.312 --> 19:24.545
Look, she just came
out of here.

19:24.547 --> 19:26.414
Somebody else is gonna come
out of here and freak us out.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.916
Oh, great,
thank you for confirming.

19:27.918 --> 19:28.950
Really?

19:28.952 --> 19:30.552
Look, and then she's gonna
jump out here, too.

19:30.554 --> 19:33.356
Yes, thank you. Thanks!

19:33.358 --> 19:34.424
You're ruining this for me.

19:34.426 --> 19:36.325
No, I'm telling you.
Now someone's just

19:36.327 --> 19:38.428
gonna come out of this door
right here.

19:38.430 --> 19:39.729
- All right, let's see.
- Let's see.

19:39.731 --> 19:41.966
Stop saying things
at the same time.

19:43.402 --> 19:44.534
And Grade School
overthought it.

19:44.536 --> 19:45.637
And, three, two... Shut up.

19:45.639 --> 19:47.439
Three, two, one.

19:47.441 --> 19:49.074
Help me! He's following me.

19:49.076 --> 19:50.977
- Please!
- Oh. See, your timing was off.

19:50.979 --> 19:52.077
And location.

19:52.079 --> 19:53.779
Please, help me. Please.

19:53.781 --> 19:56.518
Oh, my God!
He's coming!

19:58.320 --> 20:00.456
Okay. Well, I was still
kind of right.

20:01.022 --> 20:02.524
So melodramatic.

20:05.059 --> 20:05.428
Oh, hi, buddy.

20:06.062 --> 20:07.497
Hello.

20:08.098 --> 20:09.597
He got the...

20:09.599 --> 20:10.499
Okay.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.469
Class deceased.

20:13.471 --> 20:16.406
If at first you don't
succeed, die and die again.

20:16.408 --> 20:18.442
He's got the wonky eyeballs.

20:18.444 --> 20:20.010
He's been through some things.

20:20.012 --> 20:22.012
Yeah, you're not scary, dude.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.680
- Okay.
- Did you see that?

20:28.689 --> 20:31.724
Okay, just get back on script,
guy. Your girl's over there.

20:31.726 --> 20:32.993
With the big arrow.

20:32.995 --> 20:36.495
Where it says, "Don't look." She's
in that thing, you should...

20:40.103 --> 20:43.871
No, no. Just stop!
Please.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.141
Help me! Please! Please!

20:46.143 --> 20:48.043
No, no, no!

20:48.045 --> 20:49.478
Stop it!

20:49.480 --> 20:50.779
Yeah, no, fuck that. I'm good.

20:50.781 --> 20:52.382
Yep. Let's go.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.516
Stop!

20:53.518 --> 20:54.616
Stop it! No!

21:10.705 --> 21:12.137
Okay, just do it.

21:43.576 --> 21:44.676
That was
fucking insane.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.444
I know. Now you know
why I wanna come here.

21:46.446 --> 21:47.578
Yes, I get it.
This is fucking...

21:47.580 --> 21:48.846
- I know!
- Jesus Christ!

21:48.848 --> 21:50.215
Hey, you good?

21:50.217 --> 21:51.951
What took you so long?

21:51.953 --> 21:53.685
That was really fucking real
in there at the end.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.390
Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah! Really intense.

21:55.824 --> 21:57.758
You need some?

21:57.760 --> 21:59.526
Yes.

21:59.528 --> 22:00.894
Go Grade School.

22:02.097 --> 22:04.499
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

22:07.503 --> 22:09.472
I love this place
so much!

22:09.474 --> 22:10.539
Come on. Let's go.

22:10.541 --> 22:11.906
She just, like, walks away?

22:11.908 --> 22:13.677
You ditched us.
What do you want?

22:26.124 --> 22:28.260
Looks like you made a friend,

22:28.262 --> 22:30.262
Grade School.

22:30.264 --> 22:33.065
Well, at least I wasn't crying
like a baby in there, College.

22:33.067 --> 22:35.034
Okay! All right,
I might like you.

22:35.036 --> 22:37.536
Let's keep going.
Keep it up.

22:37.538 --> 22:39.009
I like this sassy side.

22:43.211 --> 22:45.579
Wait, does she still snore
like an outboard motor

22:45.581 --> 22:46.681
when she's drunk, because...

22:46.683 --> 22:47.781
Like a fucking buzz saw.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.884
You two are getting
a little too close, all right?

22:49.886 --> 22:51.854
Well, you can't
stay mad, so...

22:51.856 --> 22:53.088
Oh, one night at Hell Fest,

22:53.090 --> 22:54.656
and you're coming out
of your shell.

22:54.658 --> 22:55.924
It looks good, right?
It suits her.

22:55.926 --> 22:57.594
Yeah.

22:57.596 --> 22:58.761
Look, is that the same guy
from the Deform School?

22:58.763 --> 23:00.763
- Hey!
- Don't do that.

23:00.765 --> 23:01.932
- Why?
- Jesus Christ!

23:01.934 --> 23:04.202
He's an actor. He gets paid
minimum wage to follow us.

23:04.204 --> 23:06.303
But he's only following us.
It's stalker-ish.

23:06.305 --> 23:07.405
- Yo, let's go.
- Keep it moving.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.875
Yo, guys, this is the same
dude from Deform School.

23:09.877 --> 23:11.743
Nat, he's just an actor.
They fuck with everyone.

23:11.745 --> 23:12.877
Seriously, ignore him.
He'll get bored.

23:12.879 --> 23:14.012
It works with Brooke.

23:14.014 --> 23:15.215
Yeah, no, no,
that's great advice.

23:15.217 --> 23:16.582
That always works
with stalkers. Thanks.

23:16.584 --> 23:17.951
Hey. Listen.

23:17.953 --> 23:20.119
If he gets too close,
I'll fuck him up for you.

23:20.121 --> 23:22.188
Oh, my God!
That's adorable. I got it.

23:22.190 --> 23:23.558
You guys are gonna
handle this one?

23:23.560 --> 23:25.860
- Yeah.
- Yeah, of course. We got you.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.563
Dude, I told you
it'd be fun with her here.

23:27.565 --> 23:29.598
I know! You're right.
She's awesome!

23:32.604 --> 23:33.870
- This is amazing.
- This is dope!

23:33.872 --> 23:35.572
Oh, crap.

23:35.574 --> 23:37.774
Oh, look, it's you.
It's your future, Ash.

23:37.776 --> 23:39.242
Okay. No, no, no!

23:41.146 --> 23:44.148
Oh, shit.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.983
Come on, girl, let's go
win you some cheap-ass prizes.

23:45.985 --> 23:47.852
That is so antiquated
of you, Ash.

23:47.854 --> 23:49.921
- They have funnel cakes!
- Off we go!

23:49.923 --> 23:50.990
Have fun, you two.

23:50.992 --> 23:52.724
Hey, Gavin...

23:52.726 --> 23:54.059
Great. That's...

23:54.061 --> 23:55.795
Thanks, Quinn.
That was so subtle of you.

23:55.797 --> 23:57.029
Thanks for that.

23:57.031 --> 23:58.731
- I'm sorry.
- Um...

23:58.733 --> 24:01.167
Here. Let's play a game.

24:01.169 --> 24:03.003
- Are you ready for this?
- I am. Are you ready?

24:03.005 --> 24:04.806
Ready as I'll ever be.

24:04.808 --> 24:05.843
Mine.

24:08.043 --> 24:09.677
You are really close.
Maybe it's just your...

24:09.679 --> 24:11.081
I just need to stop
overthinking it.

24:11.948 --> 24:13.014
No look.

24:13.016 --> 24:14.884
- What you wanna do?
- I'm doing it, too.

24:14.886 --> 24:16.556
Prize time. Dang it.

24:19.824 --> 24:21.024
Are you sure
you're not left-handed?

24:21.026 --> 24:22.860
- Who won? Who won?
- Yes!

24:24.397 --> 24:26.263
Oh, wow.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.899
Let me show you how it's done.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.234
Well, now I just wanna
keep this.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.842
- For my queen.
- Thanks, babe.

24:35.043 --> 24:37.176
- Oh, wow!
- Shit!

24:37.178 --> 24:38.378
You definitely took
that somewhere.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.213
- I'm sorry about that.
- Ready, one...

24:40.215 --> 24:42.217
Two, three... Go!

24:45.021 --> 24:46.123
This is painful, bruh.

24:47.257 --> 24:48.690
- Okay. Thanks.
- It's not that bad.

24:48.692 --> 24:49.693
It's pretty bad.

24:52.195 --> 24:53.828
- That was close!
- It was. Thank you.

24:53.830 --> 24:54.930
- It was...
- Yeah.

24:54.932 --> 24:55.998
- No, no, no!
- No, I got another one

24:56.000 --> 24:57.067
- It's more than okay.
- It's really not.

24:57.069 --> 24:58.934
We don't have to...
It's been, like, five games.

24:58.936 --> 25:00.270
You know how good
you're gonna feel

25:00.272 --> 25:01.538
when you have a teddy bear
of your very own?

25:01.540 --> 25:03.707
Sometimes you just have to
accept that it's not for you.

25:06.146 --> 25:08.746
I'm sorry,
I'm so shitty at ring toss.

25:08.748 --> 25:09.814
It's okay.

25:09.816 --> 25:11.082
I was honestly
trying my best.

25:11.084 --> 25:13.918
But I think my game of choice
is the one where you're like,

25:13.920 --> 25:14.854
"Here's five dollars."

25:14.856 --> 25:16.156
And the guy's like,
"Here's a pretzel."

25:16.158 --> 25:17.322
So you pay for things?

25:17.324 --> 25:18.725
Yeah, but at an incredibly
fast rate.

25:18.727 --> 25:19.659
Okay.

25:19.661 --> 25:21.861
I think that's my game
of choice. Hello.

25:21.863 --> 25:23.164
Oh, hello!

25:23.166 --> 25:26.167
What? Can I?
May I? Thank you.

25:26.169 --> 25:27.334
Wow! It's so coiffed.

25:27.336 --> 25:29.071
- It really is.
- It's so beautiful.

25:29.073 --> 25:30.404
I think you should
get one of those.

25:30.406 --> 25:32.441
I was gonna say
I think you should.

25:32.443 --> 25:35.077
Well, I can't, so...

25:35.079 --> 25:37.212
So what do you think so far?

25:37.214 --> 25:38.481
Of the pretzel?

25:38.483 --> 25:40.718
- Uh, no, not the pretzel.
- Good. Could use mustard.

25:40.720 --> 25:41.752
I do want a piece of this.

25:41.754 --> 25:44.153
- Oh, you're a mustard kind of girl?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:44.155 --> 25:45.291
I meant of Hell Fest.

25:46.960 --> 25:51.196
What do you think? Like hanging out?
Two of us?

25:51.198 --> 25:53.465
- I like hanging out with you.
- Okay. Good.

25:53.467 --> 25:55.433
I'm sorry that I've been
so flaky actually.

25:55.435 --> 25:58.872
I've just been having a really
tough time with school

25:58.874 --> 26:00.906
and work, and life, so...

26:00.908 --> 26:02.277
It's just nice to be here.

26:03.879 --> 26:06.347
- Nice to be in Hell.
- Yep. It's nice to be in Hell.

26:06.349 --> 26:08.152
- It's the best place to be.
- Yeah.

26:13.490 --> 26:15.291
- Come here.
- Yeah.

26:15.293 --> 26:18.427
Oh, God! But that was
a perfectly good pretzel.

26:18.429 --> 26:20.433
I'm sorry.
It was not salty enough.

26:24.303 --> 26:26.371
Oh, God, I am so bad
at these things.

26:26.373 --> 26:27.506
Oh, we have to pay
under here.

26:27.508 --> 26:28.710
Yeah. Okay.

26:33.047 --> 26:34.146
- What do we...
- Um...

26:34.148 --> 26:36.149
Smile.
Just smile like an idiot.

26:36.151 --> 26:37.549
Not that you're an idiot.

26:37.551 --> 26:40.422
No, that's really the only way
I know how to do it.

26:47.263 --> 26:48.396
Uh, drunk face?

26:48.398 --> 26:51.066
Uh, sure, okay. I don't
really have a drunk face.

26:51.068 --> 26:53.035
I don't, either.
I'm a stoic drunk.

26:53.037 --> 26:55.136
Yeah. I'm a
very composed...

27:00.044 --> 27:01.845
Um...

27:01.847 --> 27:03.848
No, no, you don't touch it.
Just your...

27:03.850 --> 27:05.215
Well, I didn't know
if I was supposed to...

27:05.217 --> 27:07.387
With my tongue?
What do you want me to do?

27:11.492 --> 27:13.157
How could you not know
that I was going

27:13.159 --> 27:14.561
- for the nose-tongue picture?
- I don't know

27:14.563 --> 27:15.696
- how many people...
- How dare you.

27:15.698 --> 27:19.067
I didn't know there was
a type of picture you take.

27:59.514 --> 28:00.882
Yo!

28:01.483 --> 28:03.484
What the fuck? Hey!

28:03.486 --> 28:04.651
Is that Brooke?

28:04.653 --> 28:07.320
- You sure? Was that Brooke?
- Brooke?

28:07.322 --> 28:08.560
What the hell?

28:10.227 --> 28:11.994
That guy just
took your photos.

28:11.996 --> 28:14.029
- What?
- Babe, here.

28:14.031 --> 28:16.064
- Whoa. Whoa!
- Hey!

28:16.066 --> 28:17.132
- Brooke.
- Babe!

28:17.134 --> 28:18.136
- You guys, come on!
- Hey!

28:18.969 --> 28:20.069
What's going on?

28:20.071 --> 28:21.272
- Did you two just...
- Come on,

28:21.274 --> 28:22.508
- let's make fun of him!
- Take pictures together.

28:24.043 --> 28:25.045
Yo!

28:27.948 --> 28:29.917
Oh, so you're hiding now?

28:31.183 --> 28:32.421
You gonna scare me?

29:02.220 --> 29:04.254
Hey, I told you to...

29:04.256 --> 29:05.258
Stop.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.576
Shit!

29:23.578 --> 29:25.446
When did you become
a tough guy?

29:25.448 --> 29:27.982
Listen, I scared him off.
Let's go.

29:27.984 --> 29:29.584
Did you?
Did you get the photos?

29:29.586 --> 29:30.719
No, but he's gone.

29:30.721 --> 29:32.456
Here, take this.

29:38.096 --> 29:39.229
That's gonna
consume her.

29:39.231 --> 29:40.596
It's a pleasure to meet you.

29:40.598 --> 29:42.432
Hey, guys! I found
Nat's security guard.

29:42.434 --> 29:44.100
Hey, did you get the pictures
back? What happened?

29:44.102 --> 29:46.503
I took care of it,
like I said I would.

29:46.505 --> 29:47.704
- Is that what you did?
- Yes.

29:47.706 --> 29:49.106
It's the same guy, right?

29:49.108 --> 29:50.442
- Wait, Deform School guy?
- Yeah.

29:50.444 --> 29:51.743
He's just going
for Employee of the Year.

29:51.745 --> 29:52.678
He's doing pretty damn good.

29:52.680 --> 29:54.613
I mean, look at both
of your faces right now.

29:54.615 --> 29:57.483
All right, fuck this place
anyway. It is Deadlands time.

29:57.485 --> 29:58.717
I wanna be touched.

29:58.719 --> 29:59.618
Yes. Thank you!
Let's go, let's go.

29:59.620 --> 30:00.486
All right.
Deadlands. I'm in.

30:00.488 --> 30:02.289
Yeah, you guys go
and then I'm gonna

30:02.291 --> 30:04.190
- catch up with you, okay?
- What?

30:04.192 --> 30:06.694
Just go, and then I'm gonna
catch up to you guys.

30:06.696 --> 30:07.794
- What, what are you...
- Just go.

30:07.796 --> 30:09.230
I wanna
get her a toy.

30:09.232 --> 30:10.431
Just go really quick,
and then I'll meet up.

30:10.433 --> 30:11.565
Do what you gotta do.

30:11.567 --> 30:13.301
- Okay, do you want company?
- No, no, no.

30:13.303 --> 30:16.072
Me and the bearded lady,
we exchanged this look.

30:16.074 --> 30:17.372
I think she's gonna
give me beard lessons.

30:17.374 --> 30:18.408
So, I'm gonna go
get her number.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.411
That's not a thing.
I can just come with you.

30:20.413 --> 30:21.478
It's totally a thing.

30:21.480 --> 30:22.545
Okay.

30:22.547 --> 30:23.613
So, we'll meet you
in line then?

30:23.615 --> 30:24.680
Yeah, dude,

30:24.682 --> 30:26.049
if you're not there
by the time

30:26.051 --> 30:27.218
we get to the front
of the line,

30:27.220 --> 30:28.519
I'm going to Hell
without you.

30:28.521 --> 30:29.687
Yeah, I'll meet you there.

30:29.689 --> 30:30.587
Just be really fast.

30:30.589 --> 30:32.424
'Cause she really likes you.
You know?

30:32.426 --> 30:34.125
And, she thinks
you're really hot.

30:34.127 --> 30:35.728
She doesn't wanna
do Deadlands without you.

30:35.730 --> 30:37.496
That wasn't uncomfortable
at all.

30:37.498 --> 30:39.433
- We're going. Let's go.
- You're not hurrying!

30:39.435 --> 30:40.470
All right. Bye.

30:46.141 --> 30:47.340
Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

30:47.342 --> 30:50.779
Excuse me? Hey, um...
We're VIP, can we just...

30:50.781 --> 30:52.681
Babe, this is VIP.

30:52.683 --> 30:54.649
- This whole thing is VIP?
- Yeah.

30:54.651 --> 30:56.285
Hey, don't worry about Gavin.

30:56.287 --> 30:57.654
He's probably pooping
or something.

30:57.656 --> 31:00.156
Okay, I did not need
to picture that.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.390
What? Everybody poops, Nat.

31:01.392 --> 31:04.294
Birds poop, bees poop. Honey!
That's where it comes from.

31:04.296 --> 31:05.766
No more drinks for you.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.303
Hey. You remember me? Earlier?

31:11.305 --> 31:12.504
I was here playing
the ring toss?

31:12.506 --> 31:13.641
And you were terrible at it?

31:14.741 --> 31:17.677
That was me.
Thank you. Yeah.

31:17.679 --> 31:20.581
Um, hey, listen,
I spent like $50.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.052
Could you just help me out
and give me one of those?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.424
Nah. I'd lose my job.

31:30.260 --> 31:32.827
All right. Hey, thank you.

31:32.829 --> 31:34.063
Thanks so much.

31:34.065 --> 31:36.568
Wait, what actually happened
with that guy that you chased?

31:37.300 --> 31:38.734
Mmm.

31:38.736 --> 31:41.671
It got real intense,
so I just bailed.

31:41.673 --> 31:43.507
I can't figure out what
his fucking deal is.

31:43.509 --> 31:45.342
Me either.

31:45.344 --> 31:47.310
But, hey, no,
you're having a great time,

31:47.312 --> 31:48.311
Gavin's totally into you,

31:48.313 --> 31:49.646
you're stepping out
of your comfort zone...

31:49.648 --> 31:51.686
- He's cute, right?
- Hell yeah!

31:59.827 --> 32:01.628
Hey,
are we good on stock?

32:01.630 --> 32:03.464
Yeah, we got
plenty of stuffed animals

32:03.466 --> 32:04.598
back in the locker.

32:04.600 --> 32:05.802
We're good.

32:12.476 --> 32:13.707
It just slipped out.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.478
Uh, why do we keep
waiting in line for rides?

32:16.480 --> 32:18.214
I thought we were doing mazes.

32:18.216 --> 32:20.784
B, this is the ride that
takes us to the Deadlands.

32:20.786 --> 32:22.286
It's the only way
to get there.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.786
Why are we signing a waiver?

32:23.788 --> 32:26.758
I mean, they can touch us
and liability is a bitch.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.526
That's really extreme.

32:28.528 --> 32:30.694
Extreme is what we want, Nat.
That's why we're here.

32:31.632 --> 32:33.464
Plus, if you don't sign
you can't go in.

32:33.466 --> 32:35.600
Oh, come on, Nat,
just sign it.

32:35.602 --> 32:37.371
I was just starting to like
the new you.

32:38.407 --> 32:39.505
Huh?

32:39.507 --> 32:40.941
Just let me text Gavin
and let him know.

32:42.377 --> 32:43.445
You sign. I'll text.

33:05.537 --> 33:06.640
Damn.

33:17.551 --> 33:18.953
Okay, Asher.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.273
Oh, yes.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.211
Okay...

33:46.552 --> 33:47.588
Hmm.

33:55.595 --> 33:56.631
Hmm.

33:58.466 --> 33:59.468
That's good.

34:00.401 --> 34:01.437
Oh, shit!

34:04.973 --> 34:08.976
It's you again? Seriously?
You're following me now?

34:08.978 --> 34:11.911
Nice. All right, you take
your job way too seriously.

34:11.914 --> 34:13.746
Hope you know that.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.484
You know, actually,
it's great that you're here.

34:15.485 --> 34:17.489
Can I get
my pictures back? Or...

34:22.328 --> 34:23.329
All right.

34:26.331 --> 34:28.501
Dude, drop the character,
you're offstage.

34:34.074 --> 34:35.542
Cool.

34:38.847 --> 34:40.815
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

35:17.858 --> 35:19.858
Come on, come on,
come on!

35:19.860 --> 35:21.026
And...

35:21.028 --> 35:22.796
- Thank you!
- Yes!

35:22.798 --> 35:23.897
Wait. Nat, where is he?

35:23.899 --> 35:25.031
I don't know.

35:25.033 --> 35:26.800
Just text him again.
Okay? Come on.

35:26.802 --> 35:28.168
Come on.

35:28.170 --> 35:29.739
- Come on, guys!
- Yeah, we're coming!

35:31.541 --> 35:33.107
- Sorry.
- Wait, slow down!

35:36.180 --> 35:37.546
Nat, come on!

35:37.548 --> 35:39.616
I'm coming.

35:57.938 --> 36:00.773
<i>Beware! Night Bumps</i>

36:00.775 --> 36:05.582
<i>leads to the Deadlands,
where no soul is safe.</i>

36:07.082 --> 36:09.016
- Night Bumps!
- Yes!

36:10.686 --> 36:11.753
Wait, wait, wait.

36:11.755 --> 36:13.054
Nat, come on. You gotta get on

36:13.056 --> 36:14.589
or you lose
your place in line.

36:14.591 --> 36:15.626
In or out?

36:16.961 --> 36:18.493
Sucks to be Gavin.

36:18.495 --> 36:20.597
- Great to be us.
- Okay.

36:20.599 --> 36:21.898
Let's go. Come on,
come on, baby.

36:21.900 --> 36:23.532
- Wait, Brooke.
- Oh, um...

36:23.534 --> 36:24.768
- What?
- Hey.

36:24.770 --> 36:26.736
- We should wait. No.
- No, no, no.

36:26.738 --> 36:28.606
No, Gavin assured us,
he would be there.

36:28.608 --> 36:29.807
- It's fine. Come on.
- No, wait.

36:29.809 --> 36:31.676
- He'll be right here.
- Wait. Really?

36:31.678 --> 36:33.512
Nat, I don't wanna
split up, so...

36:33.514 --> 36:34.947
Gavin'll meet us
on the other side, okay?

36:34.949 --> 36:36.614
Yeah. He will be there.
I promise.

36:36.616 --> 36:37.950
Okay?

36:37.952 --> 36:40.019
Yeah. Love you.

36:40.021 --> 36:41.220
See you in the Deadlands.

36:41.222 --> 36:44.090
<i>Beware the things that go</i>

36:44.092 --> 36:45.259

36:45.261 --> 36:46.594
<i>Night Bumps!</i>

36:46.596 --> 36:47.761
I hope she's okay.

36:47.763 --> 36:49.031
Babe, she'll be fine.

36:51.101 --> 36:52.170
Thank you.

37:05.951 --> 37:07.717
<i>Night Bumps!</i>

37:22.069 --> 37:24.203
Oh, okay. Hey!

37:24.205 --> 37:25.907
Oh. Yummy.

37:25.909 --> 37:27.077
I don't like that.

37:28.011 --> 37:29.210
Mmm-mmm.

37:29.212 --> 37:31.679
Oh, my God! Wow!

37:31.681 --> 37:33.548
- I'm so scared!
- Oh, shut up.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.919
Crap!

37:36.921 --> 37:39.190
Okay! Did you see the head
on that thing?

37:40.058 --> 37:42.161
Jesus!

37:44.697 --> 37:46.095
Fuck you, man!

37:46.097 --> 37:47.700
Jesus Christ!

37:55.676 --> 37:57.976
Shit!

37:57.978 --> 38:00.813
Okay. Great.

38:00.815 --> 38:02.018
Well, there goes that mood.

38:55.812 --> 38:57.348
Are you shitting me?

39:22.243 --> 39:23.613
Hello?

39:29.451 --> 39:31.384
Hello?

39:31.386 --> 39:34.055
<i>We are currently experiencing</i>

39:34.057 --> 39:36.091
<i>technical difficulty.</i>

39:36.093 --> 39:40.199
<i>Please remain calm while
we attempt to fix the ride.</i>

39:41.933 --> 39:43.867
Excuse me?

39:43.869 --> 39:45.401
Do you know how long
this is gonna take?

39:45.403 --> 39:48.238
<i>Please remain calm</i>

39:48.240 --> 39:51.178
<i>and try not to lose your head.</i>

40:04.792 --> 40:05.794
Hello?

40:09.398 --> 40:11.668
Hello, there's somebody
in here.

40:17.742 --> 40:18.743
Hello?

40:28.287 --> 40:30.157
Security?

40:30.957 --> 40:32.193
Hello?

40:34.094 --> 40:35.463
Security?

40:36.129 --> 40:37.397
Help me!

40:39.467 --> 40:41.434
Okay... What was that?

40:47.308 --> 40:48.942
Yo, did you guys
hear that?

40:48.944 --> 40:51.211
Yeah. It sounds like
Grade School freaking out.

40:51.213 --> 40:53.814
No, she's not just
freaking out, that's beyond.

40:53.816 --> 40:54.983
She's just getting into it.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.785
See? Here we go. Oh.

41:25.320 --> 41:28.489
<i>You are now
entering the Deadlands.</i>

41:28.491 --> 41:32.260
<i>The Other will guide you
on your journey.</i>

41:32.262 --> 41:34.329
That's awesome.
That's brilliant.

41:34.331 --> 41:36.330
- Are you kidding me?
- No! No, no, no!

41:36.332 --> 41:37.933
Nat, it was part of the ride,
get it?

41:37.935 --> 41:39.069
They fake breaking down

41:39.071 --> 41:41.136
and then they climb in
with one of the single riders.

41:41.138 --> 41:42.304
- That's awesome!
- This has been terrifying,

41:42.306 --> 41:44.173
- you asshole.
- Terrifyingly awesome!

41:44.175 --> 41:46.108
- No, it's pretty good.
- Nat. Relax.

41:46.110 --> 41:48.544
Get that out of my...
I hate you all.

41:48.546 --> 41:49.614
Dude.

41:51.384 --> 41:52.820
Asher, Asher!

41:55.956 --> 41:56.991
Oh, shit!

41:57.925 --> 41:59.227
Ah, it's so cool!

42:01.295 --> 42:02.529
What the fuck is this?

42:02.531 --> 42:04.500
The hell is that?

42:05.633 --> 42:08.168
Oh, shit!
That girl got wrecked!

42:08.170 --> 42:09.936
I hope that washes out.

42:09.938 --> 42:10.871
So, guys,

42:10.873 --> 42:13.074
uh, what do we do?
Do we just wander around?

42:13.076 --> 42:15.276
I don't know. I feel like
we should wait for Gavin.

42:15.278 --> 42:17.245
All right, Nat, real talk.

42:17.247 --> 42:18.613
I don't want
to ruin it for you.

42:18.615 --> 42:20.583
But Gavin is out getting you

42:20.585 --> 42:22.922
one of those stupid
stuffed animals.

42:23.621 --> 42:25.420
He's just gonna take a while.

42:25.422 --> 42:27.494
Because he sucks. Right?

42:28.394 --> 42:29.693
Damn it. Really?

42:29.695 --> 42:31.962
Yes, he likes you, okay? He's
gonna catch up when he does,

42:31.964 --> 42:34.267
but we're here now. So let's
have some fun, all right?

42:34.935 --> 42:36.201
Hey, guys...

42:36.203 --> 42:37.570
I think we gotta
check this thing out.

42:37.572 --> 42:39.171
He likes you

42:39.173 --> 42:42.441
and we know he's not pooping.

42:42.443 --> 42:44.344
Oh, that's nasty.

42:44.346 --> 42:45.612
I think they're in there.

42:45.614 --> 42:47.513
- Step up, Q.
- Yeah, nope.

42:47.515 --> 42:49.482
- Go for it.
- No.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.119
- No. No.
- What?

42:51.121 --> 42:52.586
You're such a wuss, Q.

42:52.588 --> 42:54.023
Yes.

42:56.294 --> 42:57.493
You okay, Ash?

42:57.495 --> 42:58.627
Yeah.

42:58.629 --> 43:00.062
- Then hurry up, man.
- You look good.

43:00.064 --> 43:01.530
I'm good. Hold on.

43:01.532 --> 43:03.499
Come on, baby.

43:07.573 --> 43:09.540
That's gross.
That's in there.

43:09.542 --> 43:11.078
That's why
I didn't do it.

43:11.944 --> 43:13.109
Okay. Hold on.

43:13.111 --> 43:14.179
That's nasty.

43:14.181 --> 43:15.947
I think I got
something.

43:15.949 --> 43:17.181
Does he always
make those noises?

43:17.183 --> 43:19.050
- I'm almost there.
- You find it yet?

43:19.052 --> 43:21.421
Oh, shit!

43:21.423 --> 43:23.022
Oh, shit!

43:23.024 --> 43:24.957
Holy fuck!

43:24.959 --> 43:26.226
- He got you!
- Look at your face.

43:26.228 --> 43:28.027
Shut the fuck up.
Take the stupid map.

43:28.029 --> 43:29.263
- Shit!
- Oh, shit!

43:29.265 --> 43:30.596
- Okay. What the fuck?
- Hey!

43:30.598 --> 43:32.633
Let me down!
What the fuck? Put me down!

43:32.635 --> 43:33.968
Uh...

43:33.970 --> 43:35.102
- What just happened?
- Asher!

43:35.104 --> 43:36.171
I don't know.

43:36.173 --> 43:37.973
I'm gonna need her back, dude!

43:37.975 --> 43:39.243
Hey, Taylor.

43:39.643 --> 43:41.476
Tay! Taylor!

43:41.478 --> 43:43.446
I get touching somebody,

43:43.448 --> 43:44.447
but picking them up
and taking them away

43:44.449 --> 43:46.148
from their entire group
is kinda fucked up.

43:46.150 --> 43:47.217
- Taylor!
- Tay!

43:47.219 --> 43:48.684
I'm gonna barf.

43:48.686 --> 43:50.687
That guy smelled like
a hobo's asshole.

43:50.689 --> 43:53.024
Wait, how do you know

43:53.026 --> 43:54.591
what a hobo's asshole
smells like?

43:54.593 --> 43:56.061
Because it smells
like Quinn's mom.

43:56.063 --> 43:57.362
- Oh!
- Where did that guy take you?

43:57.364 --> 43:58.998
I know, that's why I
know what I'm talking about.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.065
They smell so bad,
I'm gonna die.

44:00.067 --> 44:01.068
Oh, shit.

44:14.350 --> 44:16.752
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.525
Um... I guess
we're going with them.

44:22.092 --> 44:24.159
It's all right.
We can do this.

44:24.161 --> 44:25.196
Fuck.

44:26.631 --> 44:27.798
Okay.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.265
All right.

44:29.267 --> 44:30.536
- This is awesome!
- Hi.

44:32.138 --> 44:34.172
Um, maybe somebody
should text Gavin.

44:34.174 --> 44:35.406
- Guys!
- Oh, yeah, he's not...

44:35.408 --> 44:37.243
Where the hell is he?

44:57.635 --> 44:58.801
I can't see anything.

44:58.803 --> 45:00.105
I know.

45:06.811 --> 45:08.745
Yo, this is dope.

45:08.747 --> 45:12.316
<i>Welcome to your first trial.</i>

45:12.318 --> 45:15.219
<i>Will you conquer your fears</i>

45:15.221 --> 45:18.091
<i>or will your fears
conquer you?</i>

45:21.229 --> 45:22.829
Oh.

45:22.831 --> 45:25.531
Okay, bye.
Thanks for not killing us.

45:25.533 --> 45:27.768
- That was creepy.
- Right?

45:27.770 --> 45:30.170
Okay, guys, I think
this is the triple maze.

45:30.172 --> 45:32.173
Sleep Like a Baby.
Very Bad Dreams.

45:32.175 --> 45:33.340
Your Worst Nightmare.

45:33.342 --> 45:35.078
- Your Worst Nightmare!
- Sleep Like a Baby.

45:35.579 --> 45:36.577
Tay, wait up.

45:36.579 --> 45:37.846
We'll see you girls
on the other side.

45:37.848 --> 45:39.750
Hope Gavin catches up. Whoo!

45:48.226 --> 45:49.595
Flashlights?

45:50.462 --> 45:51.662
Whoa.

45:51.664 --> 45:54.165
There is no way the girls' maze
is better than this one.

45:58.538 --> 46:00.806
- Is that a baby face?
- Yeah, where is that...

46:00.808 --> 46:02.441
On the ass?

46:04.513 --> 46:06.182
This is so gross.

46:16.325 --> 46:18.463
Shit! Go, go, go!

46:29.941 --> 46:31.808
Yo, yo. They changed.

46:31.810 --> 46:33.810
How did it do that?

46:33.812 --> 46:36.647
- The girl. Look at the girl.
- The veins.

46:36.649 --> 46:37.849
- Whoa.
- Detail.

46:37.851 --> 46:39.385
This is gnarly.

46:40.655 --> 46:41.756
Whoa.

46:44.292 --> 46:46.162
Oh, now that is just awful.

46:59.243 --> 47:00.642
Oh, shit!

47:00.644 --> 47:02.480
Damn! She got me!

47:03.848 --> 47:05.648
Listen, I'm not
going first anymore.

47:05.650 --> 47:07.350
Go, Taylor. Stop laughing.

47:07.352 --> 47:08.722
I don't wanna go first.

47:09.789 --> 47:10.890
Go!

47:13.793 --> 47:14.929
What?

47:17.364 --> 47:20.468
- Whoa. Be careful.
- Okay, this is really cool.

47:23.771 --> 47:25.404
Dude...

47:25.406 --> 47:27.007
That's crazy!

47:27.009 --> 47:28.545
This is dope.

47:32.782 --> 47:34.548
I like all the swirlies.

47:34.550 --> 47:35.818
This is so dope.

47:38.888 --> 47:41.422
Like, this is insane.

47:41.424 --> 47:42.524
It's probably...

47:42.526 --> 47:43.726
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

47:43.728 --> 47:45.795
What is that? Oh!

47:45.797 --> 47:47.429
Shut up, Taylor.

48:07.857 --> 48:09.426
Oh, damn!

48:16.832 --> 48:18.369
All right.

48:23.975 --> 48:25.876
Just look at the hands.

48:25.878 --> 48:27.010
Hey, Taylor,
you should go first.

48:27.012 --> 48:29.912
Oh. I hate you
so much right now.

48:29.914 --> 48:31.515
- What if I just...
- No!

48:35.087 --> 48:36.788
Just keeping you
on your toes.

48:36.790 --> 48:38.960
Yay. That does
not look comfortable.

48:41.094 --> 48:42.695
Okay, is it just me
or is it getting...

48:42.697 --> 48:43.863
No, it's definitely
getting closer.

48:43.865 --> 48:46.098
Yeah, but are the hands longer
or are the walls just...

48:46.100 --> 48:47.000
Maybe both.

48:47.002 --> 48:48.535
The walls might be
closing in.

48:48.537 --> 48:50.338
All I know is
think little thoughts.

48:50.340 --> 48:51.605
Think little thoughts.

48:51.607 --> 48:53.106
All right, you know what?

48:53.108 --> 48:55.410
First of all, woman.
Second of all, not that bad.

48:55.412 --> 48:56.511
Yeah.

49:03.487 --> 49:04.920
Let me go!

49:12.530 --> 49:13.767
Get off!

49:15.102 --> 49:16.670
Wait! Brooke! Taylor!

49:17.437 --> 49:18.802
Yo, man.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.310
Yo, my flashlight
went out. What about you?

49:23.077 --> 49:24.744
Mine too, dummy.

49:24.746 --> 49:25.679
Hurtful.

49:25.681 --> 49:28.013
Q, it's probably a part
of the gimmick.

49:29.817 --> 49:32.119
Whoa. Wait, wait, wait. Whoa!

49:32.121 --> 49:33.887
That thing's not
slowing down, man.

49:33.889 --> 49:36.090
- No. I know, I know...
- Oh, shit!

49:36.092 --> 49:37.761
Ash! Wait up, man!

49:43.969 --> 49:46.936
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

49:46.938 --> 49:51.511
<i>when looking for illumination
on the way out.</i>

49:56.650 --> 49:57.748
Gross.

49:57.750 --> 50:00.518
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

50:00.520 --> 50:02.888
<i>when looking for illumination</i>

50:02.890 --> 50:04.693
<i>on the way out.</i>

50:10.031 --> 50:13.167
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

50:13.169 --> 50:17.407
<i>when looking for illumination
on the way out.</i>

50:22.747 --> 50:25.881
<i>Leave no bone unturned</i>

50:25.883 --> 50:29.989
<i>when looking for illumination
on the way out.</i>

50:55.083 --> 50:57.017
- Yo! What took you so long?
- That same fucking guy was in there.

50:57.019 --> 50:58.118
- What guy?
- What are you talking about?

50:58.120 --> 50:59.053
The guy!
The guy from Night Bumps.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.789
Well, news flash,
he's been everywhere.

51:00.791 --> 51:02.757
- Remember, we saw, like, 20.
- No! No, not that.

51:02.759 --> 51:05.127
The guy that I was telling you
about before,

51:05.129 --> 51:05.994
he was in there,
he was fucking taunting me.

51:05.996 --> 51:08.030
He was banging
against the Plexiglas.

51:08.032 --> 51:09.131
Nat. Hey.

51:09.133 --> 51:10.867
Look,
when Asher gets out,

51:10.869 --> 51:12.001
we'll go find someplace else.

51:12.003 --> 51:13.170
Yeah. Just give him a second.

51:13.172 --> 51:15.772
Knowing him, he's probably
having the time of his life.

51:19.546 --> 51:20.782
Quinn!

51:22.148 --> 51:23.584
Quinn!

51:28.122 --> 51:29.224
Q!

51:46.744 --> 51:48.077
Oh, shit!

52:19.716 --> 52:21.819
Just get the fuck off me!

52:22.252 --> 52:23.787
The fuck?

52:31.964 --> 52:32.966
Stop!

52:37.737 --> 52:38.739
No!

52:53.682 --> 52:55.581
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

52:55.583 --> 52:57.318
I'm just, like, I'm done.

52:57.320 --> 52:59.652
I know. You've made it through
the majority of the night.

52:59.654 --> 53:01.022
Of the fucking night?

53:01.024 --> 53:02.156
You've gotten through a lot,
all right?

53:02.158 --> 53:03.290
Fuck!

53:03.292 --> 53:04.628
Oh, shit!

53:06.629 --> 53:08.496
Fuck me!

53:08.498 --> 53:11.132
You got Brundlefly'd!

53:11.134 --> 53:12.500
What the fuck is that?

53:12.502 --> 53:15.071
That's awesome!

53:15.073 --> 53:16.039
Well, that's kind of funny.

53:16.041 --> 53:18.207
Oh, really?
It's your shirt, so, fuck you.

53:18.209 --> 53:19.743
Damn! Shut up!

53:19.745 --> 53:21.312
Let's go to the bathroom.

53:21.314 --> 53:23.047
Oh, shit!

53:23.049 --> 53:26.017
This isn't how
I wanted the night to go.

53:26.019 --> 53:28.086
It's just been a long time
since I've seen you

53:28.088 --> 53:30.655
and I wanted it to be
like it used to be.

53:30.657 --> 53:32.192
I knew this place
was gonna be creepy,

53:32.194 --> 53:33.759
I just didn't know
it was gonna be that intense.

53:33.761 --> 53:35.030
Right.

53:36.665 --> 53:38.264
But, hey, are you...

53:38.266 --> 53:39.302
Are you good?

53:40.202 --> 53:41.438
I just worry about you.

53:42.371 --> 53:44.205
And I love you.

53:44.207 --> 53:46.043
And I miss you.

53:48.479 --> 53:50.079
I love you, too.

53:50.081 --> 53:52.148
I'm sorry I haven't
been around lately.

53:52.150 --> 53:53.184
We gotta see each other more.

53:54.386 --> 53:56.455
Let's go to Spain.

53:57.490 --> 53:58.756
- You're not serious.
- I'm serious.

53:58.758 --> 54:00.156
We've always talked about it.

54:00.158 --> 54:01.358
- Let's just do it.
- You wanna go to Spain?

54:01.360 --> 54:02.427
Yeah, you said I need a break.

54:02.429 --> 54:05.063
You're probably right. So...

54:05.065 --> 54:07.332
You wanna go to the Prado
and get <i>tapas?</i>

54:07.334 --> 54:08.667
Sounds like you're saying
"topless," but...

54:08.669 --> 54:10.169
I mean, we can do that, too.

54:10.171 --> 54:11.570
You can do that. No thanks.

54:13.574 --> 54:15.107
We're going to Spain?

54:15.109 --> 54:17.143
- Yeah.
- You promise?

54:17.145 --> 54:18.380
I promise.

54:18.813 --> 54:20.249
Okay.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.249
Okay.

54:22.251 --> 54:23.584
I'll meet you out there.

54:23.586 --> 54:25.420
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

54:25.422 --> 54:28.089
We're going to Spain.

54:28.091 --> 54:30.394
We're going topless in Spain.

56:11.811 --> 56:13.615
Ugh. Gross.

57:47.024 --> 57:48.492
I'm calling the cops!

57:51.929 --> 57:52.931
Fuck!

58:55.504 --> 58:56.703
Brooke.

58:56.705 --> 58:57.804
What?

58:57.806 --> 59:00.874
What's wrong?

59:00.876 --> 59:03.144
Yeah, I don't know
what to tell you. It's empty.

59:03.146 --> 59:05.146
No, I'm telling you
that he was just here!

59:05.148 --> 59:07.081
I just had to crawl under this
thing to get away from him!

59:07.083 --> 59:08.650
- He was grabbing at me!
- All right, look...

59:08.652 --> 59:09.817
I know the scarers
aren't supposed

59:09.819 --> 59:10.685
to be in the bathroom,

59:10.687 --> 59:11.552
but if you can't even
identify him,

59:11.554 --> 59:13.856
I don't know what
you want me to do.

59:13.858 --> 59:15.691
I don't know. Shut down
the park. Call the cops.

59:15.693 --> 59:17.660
- Do something other than this!
- Are you hurt?

59:17.662 --> 59:19.997
- What?
- Did he physically hurt you?

59:19.999 --> 59:21.765
I mean, he grabbed at me.
I'm not injured.

59:21.767 --> 59:23.768
Unless there is
an actionable charge,

59:23.770 --> 59:25.737
- there's nothing I can do.
- What?

59:25.739 --> 59:27.505
No, you're not understanding
a thing that I'm saying!

59:27.507 --> 59:29.740
This guy has been stalking us
since the second we got here!

59:29.742 --> 59:31.410
- Which guy?
- The guy with the mask

59:31.412 --> 59:32.546
from the Night Bumps ride!

59:32.548 --> 59:35.547
You just described 15 people
that work in this park.

59:35.549 --> 59:37.150
You know how many complaints
I get like this a night?

59:37.152 --> 59:38.518
Great. Well, mine's valid,

59:38.520 --> 59:39.686
so what are you gonna
do with that?

59:39.688 --> 59:41.057
- Holy shit!
- What?

59:42.758 --> 59:44.959
It's the photos
of you and Gavin.

59:44.961 --> 59:46.560
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, no, no, wait.

59:46.562 --> 59:47.662
Who's Gavin?

59:47.664 --> 59:48.562
He's our friend that was

59:48.564 --> 59:49.931
supposed to meet us,
like, an hour ago.

59:49.933 --> 59:51.032
He must have Gavin's phone.

59:51.034 --> 59:54.469
Yeah, I think your friend,
Gavin, is pranking you.

59:54.471 --> 59:55.771
All right, look,

59:55.773 --> 59:57.541
you came here
to be scared, right?

59:57.543 --> 01:00:00.176
I can't arrest people
for doing their job.

01:00:00.178 --> 01:00:01.714
Welcome to Hell Fest.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:08.119
We've got to find him.

01:00:08.121 --> 01:00:09.521
Quinn. Quinn, we need to go.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:10.722
- Now.
- What?

01:00:10.724 --> 01:00:12.057
- We need to go. Now.
- Why would we leave?

01:00:12.059 --> 01:00:13.725
I'll tell you later.
Where's Asher?

01:00:13.727 --> 01:00:14.861
I haven't seen him.

01:00:14.863 --> 01:00:16.531
Then where's Taylor?

01:00:17.799 --> 01:00:19.166
She volunteered.

01:00:46.599 --> 01:00:48.633
Welcome,

01:00:48.635 --> 01:00:53.004
children of the night!

01:00:53.006 --> 01:00:56.009
Are you ready to leave

01:00:56.011 --> 01:00:57.777
the land of the living

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:59.011
and enter

01:00:59.013 --> 01:01:01.782
into the darkness?

01:01:01.784 --> 01:01:06.155
Into the world of monsters?

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.524
Whoo!

01:01:08.526 --> 01:01:12.261
In order to open up
the gates of Hell,

01:01:12.263 --> 01:01:15.298
we must spill the blood of...

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.999
Wait for it,

01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.137
wait for it,

01:01:20.205 --> 01:01:22.739
a virgin.

01:01:27.648 --> 01:01:29.179
So, about that
whole virgin thing,

01:01:29.181 --> 01:01:30.783
I think we might have
a problem.

01:01:30.785 --> 01:01:32.285
What is your name, child?

01:01:32.287 --> 01:01:34.287
Taylor Ann Smythe, your honor.

01:01:34.289 --> 01:01:36.757
You're accused of doing
the Devil's work.

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:37.991
What say you?

01:01:37.993 --> 01:01:40.626
- Totally did it.
- And what are your crimes?

01:01:40.628 --> 01:01:41.895
Well, how long
do you have?

01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:44.164
'Cause I've actually done laps
around the seven deadly sins.

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:47.834
Oh! Impressive.

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:50.973
But you must pay
for your transgressions.

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:51.976
Ooh, what is it?

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.843
Your head.

01:01:56.113 --> 01:01:57.148
Ooh.

01:01:59.117 --> 01:02:01.154
Executioner!

01:02:04.089 --> 01:02:05.191
Yeah!

01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:10.164
Oh. Okay. Well, bye-bye.

01:02:12.099 --> 01:02:13.969
- Something's not right.
- What?

01:02:17.906 --> 01:02:19.706
Something's not right.

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:20.809
What do you mean?

01:02:22.677 --> 01:02:23.978
Yeah!

01:02:38.997 --> 01:02:40.196
That's him.

01:02:40.198 --> 01:02:41.698
That's him.

01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:42.933
Wait, the guy
from the bathroom?

01:02:42.935 --> 01:02:45.235
Yeah, that's...

01:02:45.237 --> 01:02:47.204
That's him. Oh, God! Taylor!

01:02:47.206 --> 01:02:48.241
Nat, wait!

01:03:04.726 --> 01:03:06.730
Taylor!

01:03:07.797 --> 01:03:08.966
Taylor!

01:03:19.044 --> 01:03:22.715
Nat, it's okay.
It's okay.

01:03:28.822 --> 01:03:30.759
Oh, my God,
that was so much fun!

01:03:32.926 --> 01:03:34.426
Hell Fest!

01:03:39.802 --> 01:03:40.970
Hey, can someone get me
out of this thing?

01:03:42.071 --> 01:03:43.336
Hey, you got her?

01:03:43.338 --> 01:03:45.174
Please exit
the stage area.

01:03:49.379 --> 01:03:51.947
Oh, hey. Sorry about the, uh,

01:03:51.949 --> 01:03:53.281
screaming girl.

01:03:53.283 --> 01:03:54.983
Yeah, that's my best friend's
best friend.

01:03:54.985 --> 01:03:57.352
She doesn't really get horror,
so...

01:03:57.354 --> 01:03:58.858
What can you do?

01:04:04.730 --> 01:04:06.096
Can you get me out?

01:04:06.098 --> 01:04:07.168
Please?

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:12.774
Yes! Awesome, thank you.

01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:16.442
Ow! What the hell, man?

01:04:16.444 --> 01:04:18.243
I said out, not forward.

01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:19.412
Ow!

01:04:19.414 --> 01:04:22.048
And not tighter. Dude, did you
just skip training day?

01:04:22.050 --> 01:04:24.519
'Cause you're really
not doing this right. It's...

01:04:24.521 --> 01:04:27.055
Okay, that's really tight.

01:04:27.057 --> 01:04:28.388
This isn't a funny joke.

01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:30.024
Ow! Okay.

01:04:30.026 --> 01:04:31.960
Jesus, can you not hear
when I say "Ow"?

01:04:31.962 --> 01:04:33.094
This is not comfortable.

01:04:33.096 --> 01:04:34.899
Ow!

01:04:35.799 --> 01:04:37.834
Okay, too tight.

01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:40.035
This is really not funny.
I don't like this.

01:04:40.037 --> 01:04:41.273
This is really uncomfortable.

01:04:51.017 --> 01:04:52.086
Brooke!

01:04:52.887 --> 01:04:54.285
Quinn!

01:04:54.287 --> 01:04:56.156
Somebody help me!

01:04:56.158 --> 01:04:57.290
Are you happy now?

01:04:57.292 --> 01:04:59.092
'Cause now we're gonna have
to call the cops on you.

01:04:59.094 --> 01:05:00.528
Yeah, no, that's exactly what
I want you to do!

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:01.762
Two of our friends
are missing!

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.396
No, two of your friends are
somewhere in the park, drunk.

01:05:03.398 --> 01:05:04.465
No, they're not!

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:05.469
Help me!

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.837
Shit! Quinn!

01:05:11.441 --> 01:05:13.242
Come on!

01:05:13.244 --> 01:05:15.443
Oh, my God, someone help!

01:05:17.949 --> 01:05:19.218
Help me!

01:06:43.616 --> 01:06:45.282
Help me, please!

01:06:45.284 --> 01:06:46.449
Please help me! Please!

01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:49.053
- Help me!
- You suck at this shit!

01:06:49.055 --> 01:06:50.923
- Guys, I think it's Taylor.
- Who's...

01:06:50.925 --> 01:06:52.627
- Hey, where are you...
- Fuck out of my way!

01:06:54.028 --> 01:06:56.062
We got a situation
in the Deadlands.

01:06:56.064 --> 01:06:57.562
He's trying to
kill me! Get out of the way!

01:06:57.564 --> 01:06:58.998
Get out of the way!

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.566
Somebody, help me,
please! Help me!

01:07:00.568 --> 01:07:01.568
Please help me! Please!

01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:04.137
Get out of the way,
he's trying to kill me!

01:07:04.139 --> 01:07:05.342
What are you doing? Don't...

01:07:09.278 --> 01:07:11.613
Hey, man, what are you doing?

01:07:17.654 --> 01:07:20.492
- Quinn, Quinn!
- Brooke. Brooke. Brooke!

01:07:23.562 --> 01:07:25.996
- Quinn! No!
- We gotta go.

01:07:25.998 --> 01:07:27.467
Brooke, we gotta go.

01:07:45.988 --> 01:07:47.189
Get down on the ground!

01:07:48.324 --> 01:07:50.127
We got him! Got him!

01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.507
- Nat! Are you okay? You okay?
- Yeah.

01:08:04.509 --> 01:08:06.480
<i>Please find the nearest exit.</i>

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.528
Come on, we gotta go.
Come on, we gotta go.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.229
<i>Due to unforeseen
circumstances</i>

01:08:23.231 --> 01:08:24.564
<i>the park will be closing.</i>

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:27.037
<i>Please find the nearest exit.</i>

01:08:37.548 --> 01:08:39.348
<i>Due to unforeseen
circumstances</i>

01:08:39.350 --> 01:08:40.683
<i>the park will be closing.</i>

01:08:40.685 --> 01:08:42.452
- Nat, over here.
- Okay.

01:08:42.453 --> 01:08:44.522
I think
this is an exit.

01:08:48.495 --> 01:08:51.430
<i>You are
at the entrance to Hell.</i>

01:08:51.432 --> 01:08:52.532
It's another maze.

01:08:55.069 --> 01:08:57.502
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

01:08:57.505 --> 01:08:58.703
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

01:08:58.706 --> 01:09:00.377
We gotta go, we gotta go.

01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:07.551
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

01:09:21.567 --> 01:09:24.468
<i>You are
at the entrance to Hell.</i>

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.571
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

01:09:31.877 --> 01:09:34.779
<i>You are at the entrance
to Hell.</i>

01:09:34.782 --> 01:09:37.819
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

01:09:42.657 --> 01:09:45.359
<i>You are at the entrance
to Hell.</i>

01:09:45.361 --> 01:09:48.599
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

01:09:57.475 --> 01:09:59.144
<i>Welcome to Hell.</i>

01:10:21.903 --> 01:10:23.105
Wait!

01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:26.941
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What? What?

01:10:26.943 --> 01:10:29.509
Look, these are triggering
the rooms.

01:10:29.511 --> 01:10:31.212
This is what's making
the noise.

01:10:31.214 --> 01:10:32.648
- Come with me.
- No. Nat.

01:10:32.650 --> 01:10:33.782
Brooke, I'm telling you...

01:10:33.784 --> 01:10:34.949
We gotta go that way.

01:10:34.951 --> 01:10:36.655
Shh, listen, you have
to trust me, okay?

01:10:37.421 --> 01:10:39.321
Listen. We have to go.

01:10:39.323 --> 01:10:40.890
Come.

01:10:40.892 --> 01:10:42.426
Okay, come on.

01:10:42.428 --> 01:10:44.230
Come on.
There's a closet back here.

01:10:56.677 --> 01:10:58.611
I can't get reception.

01:10:58.613 --> 01:10:59.847
Me neither.

01:11:01.416 --> 01:11:03.620
It's not working.

01:11:31.785 --> 01:11:33.718
Okay.

01:11:44.367 --> 01:11:45.769
Come on, come on, come on.

01:12:07.793 --> 01:12:10.695
<i>You are
at the entrance to Hell.</i>

01:12:10.697 --> 01:12:14.002
<i>Can you make it out
the other side?</i>

01:12:16.971 --> 01:12:18.171
No.

01:12:18.173 --> 01:12:21.510
No, this can't be happening.
No, wait, wait. Wait, wait.

01:12:22.977 --> 01:12:25.078
Please, somebody, help!
Please! Please!

01:12:28.384 --> 01:12:30.016
We're gonna have
to go through, okay?

01:12:30.018 --> 01:12:33.321
Listen. Shh! We're gonna
have to go through.

01:12:33.323 --> 01:12:35.626
We can do this.
Together, okay?

01:12:35.992 --> 01:12:37.593
Okay. Okay.

01:12:37.595 --> 01:12:39.565
- We can do this.
- Okay.

01:12:41.432 --> 01:12:42.901
We gotta go.

01:13:12.035 --> 01:13:14.505
Fuck.
It's all fake.

01:13:24.684 --> 01:13:25.686
Brooke.

01:13:29.488 --> 01:13:32.691
Okay. Okay. You okay?

01:13:32.693 --> 01:13:34.058
Yeah.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:35.995
We can do this.

01:13:35.997 --> 01:13:37.399
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:13:53.649 --> 01:13:55.519
We left that open.

01:13:58.722 --> 01:14:00.126
We left that door open.

01:14:50.183 --> 01:14:51.782
He's not in here.

01:14:53.252 --> 01:14:54.953
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

01:14:54.955 --> 01:14:56.424
Okay. Okay.

01:14:58.959 --> 01:15:01.830
<i>Don't
look at their faces, Mommy.</i>

01:15:02.798 --> 01:15:04.230
More dolls.

01:15:04.232 --> 01:15:05.765
Let's just get the fuck
out of here.

01:15:05.767 --> 01:15:09.673
<i>Don't look
at their faces, Mommy.</i>

01:15:11.707 --> 01:15:15.843
<i>Don't look
at their faces, Mommy.</i>

01:15:52.288 --> 01:15:53.490
Brooke!

01:16:23.992 --> 01:16:26.763
It's a dead end.
It's a dead end.

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:27.231
<i>Clever, clever.</i>

01:17:27.233 --> 01:17:28.902
<i>You've found the hidden path</i>

01:17:29.669 --> 01:17:31.771
<i>to Hell.</i>

01:17:36.778 --> 01:17:38.778
<i>Clever, clever.</i>

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:42.652
<i>You've found the hidden path
to Hell.</i>

01:18:33.976 --> 01:18:35.477
Brooke, go!

01:19:18.163 --> 01:19:19.164
No!

01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:29.744
Brooke?

01:19:45.035 --> 01:19:46.770
Nat! Help me, please!

01:20:03.557 --> 01:20:05.026
Please, no, please!

01:20:08.095 --> 01:20:09.462
Why are you doing this?

01:20:09.464 --> 01:20:12.499
Please, please,
why are you doing this?

01:20:12.501 --> 01:20:14.003
I won't tell anybody!
Please!

01:20:16.839 --> 01:20:18.840
No! Wait, wait!
Please!

01:20:18.842 --> 01:20:20.044
No!

01:20:25.516 --> 01:20:26.884
Go to Hell!

01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:43.735
Hey, back up!

01:20:43.737 --> 01:20:45.236
He was
right behind us.

01:21:24.218 --> 01:21:27.088
We looked everywhere,
but we couldn't find him.

01:21:28.822 --> 01:21:30.026
Wait, what?

01:21:32.728 --> 01:21:34.497
No, no, no,
he was right there.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:38.235
Don't worry. We're gonna
keep looking, okay?

01:21:52.249 --> 01:21:53.816
<i>They're gonna find him.</i>

01:21:53.818 --> 01:21:55.919
<i>Tragedy at Hell Fest tonight.</i>

01:21:55.921 --> 01:21:57.655
<i>Police believe
that the suspect</i>

01:21:57.657 --> 01:21:59.657
<i>may have entered
the park anonymously</i>

01:21:59.659 --> 01:22:00.959
<i>with the rest
of the attendees.</i>

01:22:00.961 --> 01:22:03.193
<i>Four fatalities
have been confirmed</i>

01:22:03.195 --> 01:22:05.130
<i>with two of the bodies
being hidden</i>

01:22:05.132 --> 01:22:07.666
<i>within mazes inside the park.</i>

01:22:07.668 --> 01:22:09.969
<i>All of this leads police
to connect tonight's murders</i>

01:22:09.971 --> 01:22:12.639
<i>to the killing of a girl
at an Orange Grove haunt</i>

01:22:12.641 --> 01:22:14.308
<i>just a few years ago.</i>

01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:16.079
<i>If you're just tuning in,
tragedy...</i>

01:23:33.235 --> 01:23:35.238
Daddy, you're home!

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.996
Did you bring me anything?
