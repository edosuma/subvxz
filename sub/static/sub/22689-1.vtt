00:53.470 --> 00:55.393
Oliver?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.482
Oliver?

01:05.147 --> 01:08.527
I've been looking all
over the hotel for you.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.112
Good morning, Mr. Kelleher.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.869
It hasn't been morning
for over an hour.

01:16.994 --> 01:18.541
Really?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.757
Guess I must have stayed out a
little later than I thought.

01:21.999 --> 01:25.629
Look, it's not that I don't
love standing here evaporating.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.263
But we got a wine tasting
to be at in 30 minutes.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.434
Oh, come on! You already own more wine
than you could drink in 10 lifetimes.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.852
What is the point?

01:34.219 --> 01:38.269
Owning a great bottle of wine is
like owning a piece of history.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.978
The way I see it, you can
never own too much history.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.230
I'll keep that in mind.

02:16.303 --> 02:19.557
I thought 1964 was meant
to be rather a good year.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.725
This tastes a bit goaty.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.527
I don't mean to interrupt.

02:24.561 --> 02:29.158
But in '64, the harvest began
the morning of September 17th

02:29.232 --> 02:31.781
and shortly after those
dreadful rains began.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.864
So whoever picked
early was unharmed.

02:34.988 --> 02:39.459
If you are interested in '64
for tomorrow's auction, um,

02:39.534 --> 02:41.787
I think you're better off
with the Petrus or Latour.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.996
Really, my dear?

02:43.080 --> 02:46.084
I think you'll find my daughter
is right, she usually is.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.092
Thank you, Margaret.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.689
Excuse me.

03:04.768 --> 03:05.815
Yes.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.155
You wouldn't have any Budweiser
back there, would you?

03:10.399 --> 03:11.400
Um...

03:11.775 --> 03:13.322
This is a wine tasting.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.203
- Morning, Richard.
- Hi.

03:19.282 --> 03:21.455
- Which one of those would you go for?
- Um...

03:22.869 --> 03:27.170
Well, they're both very nice, but
that one's bloody brilliant.

03:27.290 --> 03:31.090
I can't make up my mind
between the Maggio and the...

03:45.851 --> 03:47.273
Excuse me.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.904
Those are two different wines.

03:50.147 --> 03:51.865
They are both red.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.198
Gum?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.161
Juicy Fruit '74.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.880
You find this all
kind of amusing?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.132
No, I find David
Letterman amusing,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.001
this falls more to
the weird category.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.544
Why are you here?

04:13.420 --> 04:17.095
I got dragged here by Mr.
T.T. Kelleher.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.678
Looks like he doesn't
like your wine too much.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.023
Looks like nobody does.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.354
You are quite
sophisticated, aren't you?

04:27.392 --> 04:30.521
Absolutely, sophistication
is my strong suit.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.206
Flirting with the customers, eh?

04:45.243 --> 04:48.838
You won't understand this
concept, but I'm working.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.873
Mmm.

04:50.874 --> 04:56.005
You're just like your mother.
She was so, so American.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.346
Can't believe Father
ever married her.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.635
You know, Richard,
the only good thing

05:01.718 --> 05:03.937
about being your half-sister

05:04.012 --> 05:05.855
is that the other half isn't.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.693
Do you know what gives me the
most pleasure in this world?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.108
Fat men in high heels?

05:15.816 --> 05:22.199
No, it's knowing what a bitter and
miserable old maid you're going to be.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.045
Right.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.922
- Goodbye.
- Thank you so much for coming.

05:33.083 --> 05:34.676
Goodbye. Thank you.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.550
Margaret, Richard and I have
work to do in the office,

05:37.587 --> 05:39.089
you don't mind
tidying up, do you?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.264
Not at all.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.010
There's a good girl.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.146
I thought we did
very well today, Father.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.099
I rather
think we did.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.645
You should be able to
accomplish the entire

05:53.728 --> 05:55.696
swing through Belgium
in less than a week.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.570
Yeah, I don't see any problem.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.033
Yes, Margaret.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.278
I've, uh...

06:02.028 --> 06:03.621
Everything's straightened up.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.122
Thank you, dear.

06:05.156 --> 06:07.124
Now, when you're
finished in Belgium,

06:07.158 --> 06:09.035
perhaps you'll go down to the...

06:09.119 --> 06:10.166
What is it?

06:11.788 --> 06:14.132
Father, please, when are you
gonna send me on a trip?

06:14.332 --> 06:15.629
When you are ready.

06:15.709 --> 06:19.304
I've been here almost a year, I am ready.
You know I am.

06:20.589 --> 06:23.433
You catalog a wine cellar?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.094
Get on your hands and knees
and scrub one, more like...

06:26.136 --> 06:27.854
I'm sorry, I'm
afraid I must laugh.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.147
You are a person of
very little quality.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.601
Why do you both bicker so much?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.728
We bicker because
we are jealous.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.859
Richard is jealous of anyone
who is better than he,

06:36.938 --> 06:38.815
which includes every
living creature.

06:39.941 --> 06:44.071
I'm jealous because I really
care about wine. I love it!

06:44.154 --> 06:45.406
And you treat me like a servant,

06:45.488 --> 06:47.832
while he gets every
opportunity that comes along.

06:47.866 --> 06:49.743
You are not ready to be
sent out yet, Margaret.

06:49.826 --> 06:52.796
When you are, naturally, being
totally fair, I'll send you.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.332
But you must remember
you're still a child.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.543
Father, I'm 28 years old.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.300
This desk is 112 years old.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.216
- We don't send it to catalog wines...
- Now, that's quite enough of that!

07:03.298 --> 07:06.097
Just be patient, your opportunity
will come in due time.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.723
All right, Richard,
where were we?

07:08.887 --> 07:10.013
So it's no then?

07:10.055 --> 07:12.899
When you are ready, dear.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.351
That's what I thought you'd say.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.524
- This is my resignation.
- Ooh.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.656
That is good news.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.613
When your mother left and insisted
on bringing you up in America,

07:22.692 --> 07:23.784
I allowed it.

07:24.361 --> 07:27.865
It was a decision I always
suspected would haunt me.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.752
But this...

07:31.826 --> 07:36.457
You stop it now or I should become,
I promise you, very angry.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.881
I don't enjoy threats
a great deal.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.467
Neither do I.

07:47.550 --> 07:48.893
Good bye.

07:51.262 --> 07:54.311
Damn. Truly, truly, damn!

07:55.225 --> 07:56.693
Father, we should
celebrate her going.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.278
Celebrate?

07:58.353 --> 08:00.355
She knows more about wine
already than you'll ever learn.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.115
And she willingly does
the work of four.

08:02.816 --> 08:05.114
But Harwood's has never been
represented by a woman.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.737
Yes. Well, perhaps
that's something

08:07.862 --> 08:09.830
we ought to think
about changing.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.926
Margaret, enough of this!

08:28.758 --> 08:34.390
A lawyer friend of mine acts for an
estate in Scotland, on the Isle of Skye.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.275
His client and absentee
landlord has recently died,

08:38.351 --> 08:42.275
and this lawyer has asked me
to dispose of the wine cellar.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.992
Legal documents and other
data are all in here.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.113
Oh, thank you, Father.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.539
I swear I won't disappoint you.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.708
That's quite enough sentiment
for one day, Margaret.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.037
Come in.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.760
These will have to do you, dear.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.715
Oh, I'm sure they'll
be fine, thank you.

10:32.215 --> 10:35.219
And I serve my suppers at 6:00.

10:35.260 --> 10:40.061
The truth is, if you miss one
of my home-cooked meals,

10:40.098 --> 10:41.725
you're probably better off.

10:41.766 --> 10:42.858
On.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.769
I'll keep that in mind.

10:44.853 --> 10:48.357
I should be back if I don't have any
trouble finding the MacPherson Castle.

10:48.439 --> 10:50.533
The MacPherson Castle?

10:51.860 --> 10:54.158
Yes, what about it?

10:54.237 --> 10:57.741
Long ago, people used to say...

10:58.283 --> 10:59.500
Oh.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.914
Never mind.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.277
Nothing.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.611
Dear Luis.

11:36.946 --> 11:40.621
I know, I know this may be
hard for you to believe,

11:40.658 --> 11:43.878
since I am at the
moment torturing you.

11:43.953 --> 11:48.299
But you truly are one
of my favorite people.

11:48.917 --> 11:51.170
So you must stop
holding back from us.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.175
I'm not. I'm not.

11:53.254 --> 11:57.509
No, you've discovered the
remainder of the formula.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.855
Please, tell us where
you've hidden it.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.434
Then we can all go back
to being friends again.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.819
You must stop.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.483
I have discovered nothing.
I beg!

12:15.860 --> 12:19.285
Philippe, is this
really necessary?

12:19.322 --> 12:20.574
Yes!

12:20.657 --> 12:23.706
I know nothing. I know nothing.

12:27.664 --> 12:29.837
No! No! Please!

12:30.833 --> 12:35.009
I'm not an animal, Luis. I have
no intention of blinding you.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.011
Foreign legionnaires do this.

12:37.131 --> 12:41.511
Your vision, I promise,
will be as good as ever.

12:41.552 --> 12:46.649
But every time you blink
for the rest of your life,

12:47.392 --> 12:52.694
there will be an endurable
but rather sharp pain.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.363
Philippe!

13:02.156 --> 13:03.703
Not ideal timing.

13:04.534 --> 13:08.289
I told you to rent a place where
we wouldn't be disturbed.

13:08.371 --> 13:12.421
One visitor in five months is
not exactly a traffic jam.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.722
I'll get rid of her.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.180
I don't think you'll
be needing this, Luis,

13:21.217 --> 13:23.060
- nor this.
- Ah!

13:23.219 --> 13:25.187
Help! Help!

13:39.152 --> 13:41.325
Madam has lost her way, is it?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.116
I'm Margaret Harwood
of Harwood's Limited,

13:44.198 --> 13:45.791
here to evaluate
the wine cellar.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.086
Of course, the wine cellar.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.587
Such a shame to have traveled
so far for so little reason.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.585
The master is napping.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.255
The truth is, he is quite ill.

13:58.588 --> 13:59.805
Good bye.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.431
The truth is, he is quite dead.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.596
Deceased is the key word.

14:06.763 --> 14:07.980
I'm sure you'll agree.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.356
Of course, that is
the master's father.

14:11.434 --> 14:15.610
But it's sad for us all, the
master is ill himself of grief.

14:17.106 --> 14:21.361
But I will call your firm when
the mourning period is over.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.787
Good bye.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.447
But not farewell.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.998
If you lock me out,
I'll come back

14:26.074 --> 14:27.496
with every policemen
on the island.

14:27.575 --> 14:29.998
I have a legal right to do my
job, and I intend to do it.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.627
Won't you come in?

15:05.363 --> 15:07.866
I'll be up here if you need me.

15:09.033 --> 15:10.501
Thank you.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.868
Ugh, great.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.672
Oh, great! Looks like a wine
section from a 7-Eleven.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.139
Oh, my God!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.177
The year of the comet.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.018
<i>The year of the comet?
Are you sure?</i>

18:18.097 --> 18:20.520
Father, please,
please believe me!

18:20.641 --> 18:23.019
There's no mistake,
it's all true.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.739
<i>But, my dear, 1811, that was
the most legendary year</i>

18:26.814 --> 18:28.282
<i>in the history of wine.</i>

18:29.191 --> 18:31.285
And how large was
the bottle again?

18:31.360 --> 18:33.579
<i>Bigger than any bottle
I've ever seen.</i>

18:33.946 --> 18:35.664
Father, it was Napoleon's.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.872
It had an engraved
crest near the throat.

18:39.577 --> 18:43.582
Oh, this is just the most
exciting thing ever in my life.

18:43.664 --> 18:46.713
And by the way, Richard, since
I'm sure you're listening,

18:47.376 --> 18:50.550
<i>I know how happy you
must be for me.</i>

18:50.630 --> 18:53.053
Couldn't be more thrilled,
darling sister.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.056
Father, how soon do you
plan to auction it?

18:56.135 --> 18:58.103
<i>I'm not sure that's
the way to go.</i>

18:58.387 --> 18:59.730
I don't understand.

19:00.348 --> 19:04.854
I may just offer it out right to our
American friend, Mr. T.T. Kelleher.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.941
<i>Why?</i>

19:06.020 --> 19:10.275
Well, he's our best customer, and
he's particularly fond of Lafite.

19:10.358 --> 19:15.330
No one ever paid more than
$400,000 for a bottle.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.954
I think if I phoned and he
offered me, say a million,

19:20.868 --> 19:22.461
I'd be tempted to
let him have it.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.413
$1 million?

19:25.873 --> 19:28.626
<i>Oh, and Margaret,
congratulations!</i>

19:29.293 --> 19:31.546
You've done rather well
on your first day out.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.218
Oh, thank you, Father. Goodbye!

19:39.929 --> 19:42.899
Do sit down, Richard. This
is good for all of us.

19:43.265 --> 19:46.769
No, no, you totally misread me,
I am thrilled about Margaret.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.607
Oh, we tease, you know, but...

19:51.649 --> 19:56.120
It's all loving older brother to
adored younger sister for fun.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.120
No, I'm concerned by
the Kelleher decision.

20:01.075 --> 20:04.420
What could possibly concern you about
$1 million for a bottle of wine?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.756
Well, I think Nivanos
might pay even more.

20:07.790 --> 20:10.794
And since our job is to sell
items to the highest bidder...

20:11.043 --> 20:12.795
I know you like
Nivanos, but I don't,

20:12.962 --> 20:14.760
and furthermore, I don't
trust him either.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.799
But surely...

20:16.966 --> 20:18.468
Surely the final
decision is mine.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.646
As it should be, Father dear.

20:29.103 --> 20:30.446
This was not
supposed to happen.

20:30.521 --> 20:33.149
I was only trying
to frighten him.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.737
You make damn sure you
stop the bleeding.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.990
He lunged into my knife.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.280
Luis, I'm so upset.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.245
Not as upset as Luis, I think.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.792
This is dreadful.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.170
We are now a long way
from research science.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.914
I know.

20:48.831 --> 20:50.504
Let him sleep.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.767
I'm Oliver Plexico. I'm
here for the booze.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.886
Hi.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.064
Oh, my God, it's you!

21:47.431 --> 21:48.774
Yeah.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.565
What are you doing here?

21:52.728 --> 21:56.153
Well, it's like I said, Margaret,
it is Margaret, isn't it?

21:56.232 --> 21:57.654
I'm here for this bug juice.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.236
So if you just hand it over,
I'll be gone before you know it.

22:01.195 --> 22:02.572
How did you get in here?

22:03.405 --> 22:05.157
The door was open,
so I walked in.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.585
Look, I'm here for Mr.
T.T. Kelleher

22:07.660 --> 22:09.082
who sent me for some
bottle of rotgut.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.084
Now, as soon as I have
it, I'll say goodbye,

22:11.163 --> 22:13.086
and you can get back to being
the international sex symbol

22:13.165 --> 22:14.462
we all know and love.

22:14.542 --> 22:17.011
I hand over nothing until
I check your credentials.

22:17.169 --> 22:20.594
In the meantime, get out
of my retainers. Room!

22:21.882 --> 22:23.259
Get out!

22:23.759 --> 22:26.262
Mr. Kelleher actually
went for the million.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.848
Oh, he more than went for
it, he was thrilled.

22:29.265 --> 22:32.485
<i>But he wants to verify the
bottle's authenticity himself.</i>

22:33.060 --> 22:36.690
<i>Once he's satisfied,
he'll wire the money.</i>

22:36.772 --> 22:40.117
So then this arrogant ass he sent
is a legitimate arrogant ass?

22:41.527 --> 22:44.121
Best to Richard. Bye-bye!

22:45.573 --> 22:47.792
So what is it that
you do for Mr. Kelleher

22:47.867 --> 22:50.290
that is above and beyond
bottle retrieval?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.834
- Whatever is necessary.
- Wow.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.711
Living, breathing
troubleshooter.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.502
I don't mean to pry,

22:57.626 --> 23:00.379
but didn't that occupation
go out with Errol Flynn?

23:00.462 --> 23:03.887
Still a couple of us
arrogant asses around,

23:04.300 --> 23:06.769
trying to keep the
traditions alive.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.480
And how did you get up here
so quickly, Mr. Plexico?

23:10.639 --> 23:13.768
I was in Glasgow on business when he
phoned me, <i>so</i> I flew a chopper up.

23:13.976 --> 23:15.819
Very troubleshootery.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.489
Are you married?

23:19.648 --> 23:20.900
No. Why?

23:21.650 --> 23:22.822
Just if you were
the poor bastard,

23:22.860 --> 23:25.158
must be about two foot six from
all the hammering he takes.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.881
Jamie!

23:35.956 --> 23:38.800
Jamie! It's time.

23:40.294 --> 23:45.141
Now, when you get the bottle,
what are you going to do?

23:46.258 --> 23:47.430
I'll take it to the lake.

23:49.345 --> 23:53.521
I row to Grandfather's
cabin, and I wait for you.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.356
Perfect.

23:56.894 --> 23:57.986
Ma!

24:01.231 --> 24:02.448
May I kill them?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.443
Oh...

24:05.069 --> 24:07.288
What's a mother to do?

24:10.199 --> 24:12.293
Only if you have to.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.096
If that bottle's
broken, I'll just die.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.068
Oh, thank God.

24:39.228 --> 24:41.151
Jesus, it's a hell
of a big bottle.

24:53.951 --> 24:54.998
Hello.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.148
They are in the living room.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.238
I told them the inspector
would be here momentarily.

25:23.272 --> 25:26.822
Philippe, we should have never
let them in with Luis missing.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.699
How wise you are now, John.

25:29.778 --> 25:31.280
I didn't want a confrontation,

25:31.363 --> 25:34.458
especially since what they came
for was one bottle of wine.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.002
In, out and gone.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.045
I'll second-guess you next time.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.623
Ian, come on, they
are waiting for you.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.878
Look, I'll make a
fool of myself.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.801
I have the least notion of how
to be a police inspector.

25:45.127 --> 25:48.472
And they don't know how Scottish
inspectors behave either.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.141
Just question them quickly
and don't arouse suspicion.

25:51.175 --> 25:52.301
Scottish?

25:52.801 --> 25:53.973
Yes!

25:55.554 --> 25:56.646
Come on.

25:59.975 --> 26:03.650
Well, now, let me
get this clear.

26:03.729 --> 26:07.450
You found him after you
opened the box or before?

26:09.151 --> 26:10.152
After.

26:10.277 --> 26:11.324
I see.

26:13.781 --> 26:18.002
Well, thank you for your
help, it was indispensable.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.662
That's it?

26:20.204 --> 26:22.172
Don't you wanna ask me
any more questions?

26:22.498 --> 26:25.877
Aye, of course.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.677
But it's a wee bit complicated.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.801
It's hard at the moment
to know what to ask.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.936
But all I said was that I thought
the blood might be wine.

26:36.345 --> 26:41.021
You did and I consider that
to be a most intriguing clue.

26:42.476 --> 26:44.194
Some water, if you please.

26:47.314 --> 26:48.987
Can't we just get
rid of them now?

26:49.441 --> 26:52.115
Not till you've
questioned them both.

26:57.783 --> 27:01.458
So, Mr. Plexico.

27:01.537 --> 27:06.293
Perhaps you can shed some
further light on this.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.343
Tell me everything
that happened from

27:08.377 --> 27:11.472
your viewpoint, from
beginning to end.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.596
- We found this stiff.
- Excellent.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.519
Well, I think that's
more than satisfactory.

27:17.553 --> 27:22.775
I have your addresses.
Goodbye and bless you both.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.404
- Inspector.
- Aye?

27:32.192 --> 27:34.286
If I ever return to
a life of crime,

27:34.403 --> 27:36.531
I'm heading straight back here.

27:43.579 --> 27:44.831
I'd love to help you with that,

27:44.913 --> 27:46.165
but I'm not supposed
to lift anything.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.628
Lower back.

27:47.708 --> 27:50.427
Oh, great, I got Errol
Flynn with a slipped disk.

27:50.460 --> 27:53.179
Actually, it's more
of a spasm thing.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.305
Please, let me help you.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.385
Thank you.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.474
Thank you.

28:47.935 --> 28:49.482
Thank God that's over.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.318
It hasn't begun!

28:51.480 --> 28:53.858
- We need that box. Get the car.
- Why?

28:54.107 --> 28:56.405
Before he died, I
think Luis scrolled

28:56.485 --> 28:58.829
the rest of the formula
on the outside.

29:41.405 --> 29:42.622
Mr. Plexico.

29:44.366 --> 29:45.709
Within earshot, Miss Harwood.

29:46.827 --> 29:48.329
On behalf of Harwood's,

29:48.954 --> 29:52.549
I sincerely hope Mr.
Kelleher will be pleased

29:52.582 --> 29:56.086
with this very rare and
extraordinary acquisition.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.131
I enjoyed spending time
with you too, Maggie.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.971
Oliver.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.051
Yes, Maggie.

30:03.885 --> 30:05.057
Oh!

30:05.554 --> 30:07.602
Who are you? What do you want?

30:08.181 --> 30:09.398
What are you doing?

30:09.474 --> 30:10.475
Ah!

30:17.190 --> 30:19.488
The shitty part about
being a troubleshooter.

30:26.908 --> 30:27.909
He missed.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.754
No. He just missed us.

30:31.079 --> 30:32.251
Oh, no.

30:32.539 --> 30:34.257
- You okay?
- Medium.

30:34.291 --> 30:36.760
Good. Let's go before
he gets too far.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.216
Oh, no. Not me, not
in that thing.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.425
Hey, look. You said this
wine is important to you.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.934
Well, I don't want
to lose it either.

30:44.009 --> 30:46.933
So you can either come with me or
not, but you got to decide now.

30:54.936 --> 30:56.654
Recognize the fellow?

30:57.814 --> 30:59.031
I do, yes.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.951
The lad's a menace. I'm surprised
they let him out of jail again.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.530
He lives with his mother at
the little inn we passed.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.952
Could he have planned
this himself?

31:06.990 --> 31:10.335
That's doubtful, no. He's not
noted for his planning ability.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.832
Shouldn't we go after him?

31:11.912 --> 31:16.213
I think instead we might pay a
little visit to the mother,

31:16.458 --> 31:19.803
and see if we can convince her
to tell us where he is going.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.506
See, I find knowing
the destination

31:22.589 --> 31:25.638
takes so much of the
guesswork out of pursuit.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.769
Are you a good pilot?

31:36.061 --> 31:38.314
My instructor thinks
I'm very promising.

32:15.517 --> 32:16.564
Great.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.019
What's wrong?

32:19.688 --> 32:21.031
Which one is he?

32:27.904 --> 32:30.373
There's nothing we can do but
buzz them until we spot him.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.902
That's not our guy.

33:11.406 --> 33:12.749
That's not him either.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.422
That could be him.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.769
And he's trapped.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.846
- He is?
- He isn't?

33:35.472 --> 33:38.316
Well, not unless he gets out
of the car and surrenders.

33:38.391 --> 33:40.689
Truth is, all we can
do is follow him.

33:41.770 --> 33:43.067
Follow him?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.777
I would have thought a
genuine troubleshooter

33:44.814 --> 33:46.691
would have come up with something
a little better than that.

33:46.775 --> 33:49.949
What do you want me to do? Fly above
his roof and hover him to death?

33:59.162 --> 34:01.415
Shit! Must have hit
the fuel tank.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.715
- Maggie?
- What, what is it?

34:09.797 --> 34:10.924
You ought to know something.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.469
The first time I laid eyes on
you back at that wine tasting,

34:14.511 --> 34:15.978
I wanted to sleep with you.

34:16.346 --> 34:18.393
I'm sure you had
similar feelings.

34:18.473 --> 34:19.850
Are you kidding?

34:20.100 --> 34:21.522
Me sleep with you?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.812
You're not even in the ballpark.

34:24.437 --> 34:26.906
I need a kind man, a tender man.

34:26.982 --> 34:30.703
A man whose very being is
brimming over with sensitivity.

34:30.985 --> 34:33.830
A man who knows how to be a
friend as well as a lover.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.875
A man who's not afraid to
show me his vulnerability.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.284
Oh, my God.

34:38.326 --> 34:40.168
- Are we gonna die?
- I think, maybe.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.420
All right, I wanted you too.

34:41.496 --> 34:42.668
Hold the good thought.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.458
Ah!

34:58.221 --> 35:01.600
No. Who bloody made
all the fucking mess?

35:06.688 --> 35:07.940
Hey!

35:08.398 --> 35:10.696
Your bloody
contraption's just battered my house

35:10.734 --> 35:12.111
and scared the shit
out of my ewes.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.408
What did he say?

35:15.947 --> 35:20.168
Your flying machine has broken his
house and frightened his sheep.

35:21.369 --> 35:22.837
Oh, you dumb bastard.

35:23.705 --> 35:24.831
You dumb bastard.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.045
Yeah, yeah, I got that part.

35:27.334 --> 35:28.460
Look.

35:28.585 --> 35:30.633
We are chasing a thief.

35:31.004 --> 35:32.221
We need a car.

35:33.423 --> 35:34.515
Can you help us?

35:36.259 --> 35:38.261
Aye, well.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.398
You have the look of
good, honest people.

35:43.350 --> 35:46.399
Good, honest, rich people.

35:59.866 --> 36:01.743
You think there's
any chance of finding him?

36:01.785 --> 36:03.378
Finding him is not our problem.

36:03.411 --> 36:06.085
I've checked the map, this is
the only road for 50 miles.

36:07.749 --> 36:10.377
Catching him, on the other hand,
could be a little tougher.

36:29.312 --> 36:30.529
That's his car.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.989
Oh, and we've lost him.

36:41.074 --> 36:42.951
Wrong. We've found him.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.485
Look. There's our boy.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.182
Try and keep up.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.534
Untie it.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.265
Shh.

39:54.267 --> 39:56.770
The fog is
as thick as pea soup.

40:00.148 --> 40:02.150
I've always wanted to say that.

40:56.829 --> 40:58.081
Maggie, look out!

40:59.415 --> 41:00.792
Oh!

41:34.617 --> 41:35.618
Not the wine!

42:19.454 --> 42:20.751
What happened?

42:22.040 --> 42:23.132
Well.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.631
He wasn't much of a swimmer.

42:25.668 --> 42:28.797
But he had a hell of a grip on the box.
I couldn't pry it loose.

42:29.297 --> 42:31.140
All right. Fine.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.559
I'll get it. You just rest here.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.649
Fine.

42:41.309 --> 42:42.811
I'll just rest here, fine.

42:43.144 --> 42:45.738
She's down there risking
her life, and I'm resting.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.576
I can't do this.

43:40.785 --> 43:42.162
You all right in there?

43:44.664 --> 43:45.836
I'm fine, thank you.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.716
Can I bring you anything?

43:49.877 --> 43:50.878
I'm okay.

43:51.587 --> 43:53.385
Well, if you need anything,
I'm right next door.

44:25.496 --> 44:26.588
Maggie?

44:27.498 --> 44:29.250
- Is that you?
- What?

44:29.750 --> 44:31.127
I thought I heard something.

44:32.670 --> 44:33.671
What?

45:00.239 --> 45:01.491
Hey, hey!

45:03.951 --> 45:05.294
Hold it right there.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.122
Where do you think
you're going with that?

45:08.956 --> 45:09.957
Oh...

45:10.499 --> 45:12.797
Upon further investigation,

45:12.835 --> 45:15.179
I found it to be a crucial clue,

45:15.296 --> 45:17.674
and it must be returned
to the castle.

45:17.798 --> 45:19.846
Yeah, right. That's a clue,
you're a police inspector

45:19.926 --> 45:21.724
and I'm Herve Villechaize.

45:21.802 --> 45:22.849
What?

45:22.929 --> 45:25.398
<i>You know, the little</i>
guy <i>in Fantasy Island?</i>

45:29.352 --> 45:30.524
That's gonna hurt.

45:32.146 --> 45:33.898
Yep. There it is.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.372
Oliver?

45:53.417 --> 45:54.839
Oh, there you are.

45:54.919 --> 45:56.296
I phoned London, and
I explained to them

45:56.337 --> 45:57.805
about our little
overnight detour,

45:57.838 --> 46:00.842
but I assured them that the
bottle was now totally secure.

46:03.010 --> 46:04.512
Is there some reason
you're walking funny?

46:06.597 --> 46:08.190
The bottle is gone.

46:09.141 --> 46:11.269
Those guys from the
castle just stole it.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.529
Don't be ridiculous,
it's in my room.

46:27.201 --> 46:28.327
See, it's right there.

46:30.204 --> 46:31.922
Well, then they stole the box.

46:33.207 --> 46:35.084
Why would someone
steal a wooden box

46:35.209 --> 46:37.132
and leave a $1 million
bottle of wine?

46:39.755 --> 46:43.305
All I know is, I
just hate Scotland.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.481
Yeah, it's about
a three-hour drive.

46:57.648 --> 46:58.945
Yeah, no problem.

47:00.109 --> 47:01.281
All right.

47:01.819 --> 47:02.911
Yeah, 11:00?

47:03.779 --> 47:06.999
Good. Okay, great.
Yeah, thanks, bye.

47:09.452 --> 47:10.453
Hey.

47:16.917 --> 47:19.386
You know, I love being summoned

47:19.503 --> 47:22.006
in that suave, gentlemanly
manner of yours.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.095
And it's Miss Hey.

47:28.554 --> 47:29.601
What?

47:31.766 --> 47:34.519
The company people are handling
your car and the chopper.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.109
I have a plane ready
for us in the morning.

47:42.443 --> 47:44.411
Great. I'll see you
in the morning.

47:45.237 --> 47:47.956
I usually sleep on the right.
But I'm flexible.

47:55.623 --> 47:57.921
My God, the arrogance.

48:00.127 --> 48:02.596
What am I supposed to do,
fall into your arms?

48:02.630 --> 48:04.928
Helpless, grateful
and quivering?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.217
Quivering's good.

48:09.804 --> 48:13.058
Is it your beauty or your charm
that makes you so irresistible?

48:14.558 --> 48:16.981
Uh... Sixty-forty charm.

48:18.813 --> 48:20.611
Do women actually fall for this?

48:20.731 --> 48:22.654
A surprising number, yeah.

48:25.152 --> 48:27.871
I fear I may have a
bit too much pride.

48:28.447 --> 48:31.792
After all, in a week, you
won't even remember my name.

48:33.119 --> 48:34.587
I can't remember it now.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.669
Wait a second.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.097
If this is based on
the fact that in

48:45.172 --> 48:46.845
the helicopter I
said I wanted you,

48:48.551 --> 48:51.145
well, at the time, I
thought we were gonna die.

48:52.096 --> 48:57.023
I didn't see any need to
crush your fragile male ego.

48:58.727 --> 49:00.024
Goodnight, Oliver.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.320
Goodnight. Don't let
the bedbugs bite.

49:05.443 --> 49:06.444
Oliver.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.745
I don't know how to
break this to you.

49:10.698 --> 49:13.542
But you're not as charming
as you think you are.

49:14.201 --> 49:16.704
And you're not as clever
as you think you are.

49:18.205 --> 49:21.550
And I'm certainly not as
desperate as you think I am.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.212
Wait, wait. Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

49:24.587 --> 49:28.057
Look, Maggie, you
got me all wrong.

49:28.382 --> 49:29.725
I...

49:31.760 --> 49:33.933
I don't think I'm that charming.

49:38.601 --> 49:40.603
And I know I'm not that clever.

49:47.234 --> 49:50.534
And I certainly don't
think you're desperate.

49:53.908 --> 49:57.913
Besides, you probably have
a wife and three kids.

50:05.961 --> 50:07.759
I don't even have a dog.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.899
Look, Oliver.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.694
I'm flattered, really.

50:27.775 --> 50:28.901
But...

50:30.444 --> 50:31.821
It's just not me.

50:34.698 --> 50:35.790
I understand.

50:37.076 --> 50:38.669
I'll see you in the morning.

50:49.797 --> 50:50.798
Mmm.

50:54.510 --> 50:56.103
I changed my mind.

50:56.345 --> 50:57.437
Okay.

51:15.781 --> 51:17.579
Maggie, could
you do me a favor?

51:18.450 --> 51:19.576
Depends.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.996
What have you done
for me lately?

51:23.497 --> 51:26.171
Call the airport and see if
Kelleher's plane is ready.

51:26.875 --> 51:28.297
All right, what's the number?

51:28.335 --> 51:30.929
It's on a little piece of
yellow paper in my wallet.

52:03.370 --> 52:04.542
Did you find it?

52:06.415 --> 52:07.462
Yeah.

52:12.004 --> 52:13.472
I'll call from my room.

52:14.715 --> 52:15.932
Great, thanks.

52:25.142 --> 52:28.396
Tell me something. In Scotland,
do you have to fly on the left?

52:32.608 --> 52:36.238
Look, is it just me, or does it seem
like we stopped talking to each other?

52:36.278 --> 52:39.077
Well, goodbye, Oliver, I hope
you have a wonderful life.

52:39.531 --> 52:40.578
Excuse me?

52:40.866 --> 52:42.743
Now that you have the
bottle safely to the plane,

52:42.826 --> 52:45.545
I've decided to hang
around Glasgow for a bit.

52:45.579 --> 52:47.798
Maybe I can pick up some
extra cash hooking.

52:48.332 --> 52:50.084
Look, I don't know why,

52:50.167 --> 52:54.138
but it appears that you're a little
upset about what we did last night.

52:54.213 --> 52:56.511
And I am more than happy
to talk about it.

52:56.590 --> 52:58.638
But I prefer to do it
once we're airborne.

52:58.717 --> 53:01.140
Not that I'm superstitious, but
the last time I was on a runway,

53:01.220 --> 53:02.563
I got the shit kicked out of me.

53:02.596 --> 53:03.848
Ah!

53:12.439 --> 53:13.656
Ah!

53:13.732 --> 53:15.075
Excuse me.

53:15.109 --> 53:16.827
Um, excuse me.

53:17.653 --> 53:18.950
Please, do not be brave.

53:19.029 --> 53:20.997
Oh, but that's not your bottle.

53:21.073 --> 53:22.825
Oh, but my dear one, it is.

53:24.451 --> 53:27.295
What a splendid-looking
woman you are.

53:28.288 --> 53:29.790
Sensual.

53:30.749 --> 53:34.970
The glorious aura of sex
emanates from your perfect body.

53:36.422 --> 53:38.095
Leave this life of crime.

53:39.425 --> 53:41.177
The whole world beckons.

53:42.136 --> 53:45.140
Stop associating with
thieves and evildoers.

53:45.806 --> 53:47.149
Ready, Nico.

53:48.267 --> 53:49.439
I must go.

53:50.144 --> 53:51.270
And it pains me.

53:51.979 --> 53:55.324
In 10 years, you will be
even a greater marvel.

53:56.108 --> 53:59.703
In 10 years more, young men
will fling themselves at you.

54:03.741 --> 54:04.742
Hmm?

54:18.422 --> 54:19.674
Are you okay?

54:19.798 --> 54:21.050
Oh, I'm great.

54:21.717 --> 54:24.516
After a beating, there's
nothing I enjoy more

54:24.595 --> 54:26.563
than watching a woman
I just made love to

54:26.638 --> 54:28.561
play licky-face with
some greaseball.

54:28.640 --> 54:30.233
Oliver, they stole the wine.

54:30.851 --> 54:32.694
I know, I was right here.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.363
Well, what are we
gonna do about it?

54:34.396 --> 54:36.273
Oh, now it's "we" again.

54:36.356 --> 54:38.450
Oliver, follow their plane.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.874
I can't believe we're
doing all this for a beverage.

54:50.746 --> 54:53.716
Do you know people would cross
oceans to taste that wine?

54:54.458 --> 54:57.052
I would give anything in the
world for just one sip.

54:57.127 --> 54:58.879
Well, maybe you'll
get lucky someday.

55:00.214 --> 55:02.717
You know, your ignorance
is very impressive.

55:03.509 --> 55:06.388
That bottle is much too
valuable just the way it is.

55:06.470 --> 55:08.017
It will never be opened.

55:30.911 --> 55:33.881
I don't suppose we could
have rented a car instead.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.086
Are you kidding?

55:35.123 --> 55:37.091
The French Riviera in July?

55:37.417 --> 55:39.090
We're lucky we're not
running after them.

55:54.434 --> 55:57.529
Maggie, how badly do
you want this bottle?

55:57.604 --> 55:59.447
Extraordinarily badly.

56:00.023 --> 56:01.491
I was afraid you'd say that.

56:23.338 --> 56:26.137
Do you have any idea
where you're going?

56:26.300 --> 56:27.927
Yeah. Down.

57:06.256 --> 57:07.257
Oliver.

57:08.133 --> 57:09.259
That was incredible.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.016
I do better when people
don't sneak up on me.

57:13.555 --> 57:16.684
You know, it's amazing. It's like
there's nothing you can't do.

57:25.359 --> 57:26.906
- What is it?
- It's my back.

57:26.985 --> 57:29.033
I just threw it out
on the bottle.

57:29.363 --> 57:31.661
Couldn't have been the bottle. My
God, you just fought four men.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.371
I can hit all the people I want.

57:33.408 --> 57:35.001
I'm just not supposed
to lift things.

57:40.582 --> 57:42.334
Maggie, hit him with the bottle.

57:43.126 --> 57:44.218
Hit him!

57:44.920 --> 57:46.638
Hit him with the bottle.

57:50.634 --> 57:51.635
Hit him!

57:52.344 --> 57:54.267
Don't pay any attention
to him, my blossom.

57:55.055 --> 57:56.102
What if it breaks?

57:56.181 --> 57:58.525
I mean, technically, it still
might belong to Harwood's,

57:58.558 --> 58:00.310
even though you did agree
to purchase it, we still...

58:00.394 --> 58:02.863
Maggie, just hit him!

58:10.946 --> 58:13.995
That was actually
kind of exhilarating.

58:22.290 --> 58:23.542
Are you all right?

58:26.003 --> 58:27.505
I can't handle a motorcycle.

58:28.130 --> 58:29.427
I have to steal the Rolls.

58:31.466 --> 58:33.264
What's French for chiropractor?

58:35.512 --> 58:39.107
<i>I just need</i> a <i>pick ax</i>

58:39.516 --> 58:42.941
<i>To break your heart of stone</i>

58:43.020 --> 58:45.614
<i>Et voilà, c'est parti! Vous
en faites pas, c'est sans danger.</i>

58:46.898 --> 58:48.115
<i>Pardon.</i>

58:48.150 --> 58:50.778
<i>Vous allez me dire sije
vous fais mal! Hein?</i>

58:51.403 --> 58:52.655
<i>Ici?</i>

58:52.779 --> 58:54.452
No, no, no. That's not it.

59:14.801 --> 59:17.725
Now don't be surprised,
Miss Harwood.

59:19.347 --> 59:21.224
- Ow!
- Ooh, <i>pardon.</i>

59:21.975 --> 59:24.819
Once we ascertained you
were headed for Nice,

59:25.145 --> 59:29.446
it was really a simple matter
for our computer to discover

59:29.483 --> 59:31.281
that you rented your motorcycle.

59:34.154 --> 59:36.703
You know, you were very lucky to
get anything this time of year.

59:39.493 --> 59:40.540
Keep her quiet.

59:42.662 --> 59:45.836
I tried so hard to surprise you.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.259
But you're too smart for me.

59:47.667 --> 59:48.759
Help!

59:49.961 --> 59:50.962
Look.

59:51.630 --> 59:53.678
We stagger into the table

59:56.760 --> 59:58.012
and knock it over.

59:58.053 --> 59:59.305
We continue to fight.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:03.938
- <i>Là?</i>
- Yeah, okay, that's it.

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:07.029
You even tear my trousers
in our struggle,

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.731
causing my wallet

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:14.116
with my address to fall
unnoticed into a corner.

01:00:17.823 --> 01:00:22.704
<i>Everybody says you're an angel</i>

01:00:25.455 --> 01:00:28.459
<i>But it's the devil in your soul</i>

01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:31.219
<i>You sang for me</i>

01:00:33.797 --> 01:00:36.721
Oliver! Oliver!

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:45.063
<i>I was doing them a favor</i>

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:46.977
<i>In the end</i>

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:13.924
Maggie?

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:22.975
Where's Eze?

01:01:23.555 --> 01:01:24.727
Eze, Eze.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:25.936
Ah, Eze.

01:01:26.099 --> 01:01:27.316
- Eze, whatever, yeah.
- C'est facile...

01:01:27.392 --> 01:01:28.769
<i>Vous pouvez pas vous tromper!
C'est pas loin!</i>

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:29.902
Where is it?

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.234
<i>Vous prenez la route de la mer,
direction Villefranche Beaulieu,</i>

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.615
<i>et vous tournez à gauche
juste apràs Beaulieu.</i>

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.907
Yeah, yeah, you can't
miss it, right?

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:36.363
<i>Exactement!</i>

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:49.130
Miss Harwood, relax.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.041
This is not for you.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.802
Come, our time has arrived.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:03.061
I'm sure we look absurd
to you, Miss Harwood.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.309
God knows we acted that way.

01:02:05.597 --> 01:02:09.773
Leaving the bottle behind, but
we had no interest in it then.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.312
We thought we only
needed the box.

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:13.651
We were wrong, dear.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:17.701
The wine itself held no
interest for me because,

01:02:18.109 --> 01:02:20.362
even though I am
obviously French,

01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:22.831
the truth is, I
much prefer beer.

01:02:24.199 --> 01:02:25.826
You should spend
time with Oliver.

01:02:27.827 --> 01:02:29.079
I will.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:31.916
Ian, a little higher please.

01:02:34.292 --> 01:02:38.513
Luis had hidden the remainder
of a very important formula.

01:02:39.506 --> 01:02:41.008
Right, yeah. That's right.

01:02:41.883 --> 01:02:44.227
He died in the wine cellar,

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.936
trying to retrieve the
formula and make his escape.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.648
And at first, we thought he
had written it on the box.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.481
When that proved
to be incorrect,

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:59.117
we completely
ransacked the cellar.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:04.578
Nothing was there of interest,
so we deduced that the formula

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:09.161
had to be with the bottle.

01:03:29.222 --> 01:03:31.350
Apparently, we were right.

01:03:33.768 --> 01:03:37.523
Do you know what this
is, Miss Harwood?

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.573
The death of death.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:03.765
Well, I think

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.180
We have it.

01:04:09.554 --> 01:04:10.601
Yes.

01:04:11.598 --> 01:04:12.770
Philippe!

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.819
I'm sure that's it.

01:04:22.108 --> 01:04:23.906
- Double-check.
- Yeah.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:29.116
Your Oliver, Miss
Harwood, is he a bull?

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.998
When I was young, I was a bull.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:37.090
Believe me, I know about the sex drive.
It is very strong.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:43.509
You have my word, he will soon be
charging like a fool to your rescue.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:49.929
Ian, escort the young
lady to her chambers.

01:05:15.412 --> 01:05:16.755
Maggie!

01:07:12.987 --> 01:07:13.988
Psst.

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:15.786
Maggie!

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:27.339
I came to rescue you.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:29.254
Don't rescue me, it's a trap.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:31.593
Sweet.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:35.515
Sweet Maggie, I know
it's a goddamn trap!

01:07:35.969 --> 01:07:37.971
The guy leaves his wallet
with his address hanging out,

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.807
you think the thought of a
setup doesn't cross my mind?

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.522
The point is,

01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:46.230
I have somewhat bungled things.

01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:49.323
So, you're gonna
have to rescue me.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:53.240
Are you safe on that?

01:07:54.362 --> 01:07:55.659
Define safe.

01:08:06.749 --> 01:08:08.422
All right, here's the deal.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:11.095
I'll save your life, that's
only fair, you saved mine.

01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:13.882
Then we're quits. You have
no interest in what I want.

01:08:14.299 --> 01:08:15.346
What do you want?

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.551
A man who really loves me.

01:08:17.051 --> 01:08:18.928
- That's me.
- Bullshit.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.140
I sense from your answer
that you don't believe me.

01:08:23.015 --> 01:08:24.563
Stop being charming.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:28.066
I got nothing else going
for me right now.

01:08:28.145 --> 01:08:30.113
There's a 40-foot drop below me

01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:31.987
and a crazy lady 10 feet above.

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.777
You were cruel to me when
you didn't have to be.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.408
When?

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:37.621
After our...

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:41.000
After we'd... After
we were done with...

01:08:41.492 --> 01:08:42.618
After sex?

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:43.794
Yes, right, correct.

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.872
You could have gotten the
phone number yourself,

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.707
you didn't have to
throw your wife at me.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:50.292
I don't have a wife!

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:52.591
I saw the wedding photo.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:54.176
That's my sister.

01:08:55.006 --> 01:08:56.758
Don't make it worse.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:58.346
She was married last spring.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.886
I keep the photo because I
happen to love her, sue me.

01:09:01.554 --> 01:09:02.555
Pathetic.

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.478
Now, you listen to me, Margaret.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.227
I don't give a shit about wine,

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:10.863
and I promise you, I don't have
to work this hard to get a date.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:15.577
When I first saw you, you were
this funny, overworked ragamuffin.

01:09:15.609 --> 01:09:19.490
And I thought to myself, "Hey, a
funny, overworked ragamuffin."

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.198
I didn't have to fly
up for that bottle.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.788
I volunteered. Now, why
do you think I did that?

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.502
Why should I believe
any of this?

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:31.084
A man fresh from
the chiropractor

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:33.719
crawls up the side of the
building to save your life!

01:09:34.337 --> 01:09:37.261
This is not mass entertainment, Maggie.
It's got to be love.

01:09:40.259 --> 01:09:41.430
What was that again?

01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:43.889
You heard me.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:48.443
Well, a woman likes to hear it out
loud and as frequently as possible.

01:09:50.435 --> 01:09:51.437
I love you.

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:54.941
Okay?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.286
I'm hopelessly,

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:00.913
totally in love with you.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.619
And that's all you're
gonna get for now.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:11.712
Grab hold, I'll pull.

01:10:12.417 --> 01:10:14.044
You sure you're strong enough?

01:10:16.421 --> 01:10:19.516
I've waited all my life
for you, Oliver Plexico,

01:10:19.841 --> 01:10:21.809
I'm not about to lose you now.

01:10:35.982 --> 01:10:37.074
Okay.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:38.776
Ah!

01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:49.545
Sorry about that, just
had to get my footing.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.338
I'm fine now.

01:11:36.626 --> 01:11:39.550
Let's grab that bottle
and get out of here.

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:46.640
It's locked.

01:11:56.437 --> 01:11:58.155
I also do plumbing.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.932
Bravo, Mr. Plexico.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.611
That is what you want, I think.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:42.446
I told you he'd come for you.
The power of sex, irresistible.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:46.032
Thank you very much for this.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.740
If only I could allow
you to leave with it.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.922
I'm sorry, I don't believe a
gentleman like you would use that.

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:58.166
Believe him.

01:13:02.461 --> 01:13:03.633
They were your friends!

01:13:04.422 --> 01:13:06.140
We weren't that close.

01:13:08.593 --> 01:13:11.346
What a charming couple
you two would have made.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.266
Why are you doing this?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:18.732
Money and sex. What
else is there?

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:26.736
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:30.331
So that's what this is all
about, human growth hormone.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.333
Highest honors.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.332
What are you saying, Oliver?

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:38.881
That is a version of the human
growth hormone molecule.

01:13:38.956 --> 01:13:40.173
There is such a thing?

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.508
Absolutely.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:45.304
You mean he wants to get bigger?

01:13:47.465 --> 01:13:49.934
Younger. He wants
to get younger.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:51.560
He wants his youth back.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.974
I'm getting it back.

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:55.806
How do you know about this?

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:59.352
We experimented with age
reversal at Kelleher's labs.

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:00.861
And,

01:14:02.063 --> 01:14:03.110
it doesn't work.

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.190
Yes.

01:14:05.191 --> 01:14:10.288
But like everyone else, the formula
you were working with was flawed.

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:31.927
Is anything as romantic as
biogenetic engineering?

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:52.576
Imagine what the rich would pay

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:55.249
to have back the
bodies of their youth.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.040
It started.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.254
In a little while,

01:15:04.458 --> 01:15:08.713
the power of youth will be
surging through my groin.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:15.265
I'm going to entertain a
dozen different women.

01:15:16.595 --> 01:15:18.222
And tomorrow night

01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:21.984
and every night after that.

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:28.067
And now, I'm afraid it
is time for you to join

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:32.032
the other witnesses to
Luis' unfortunate death.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:34.372
One thing, please, just one.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:40.495
For the first time in
my life, I'm in love.

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:44.003
Now, all I'm asking is that you
let me propose before you shoot.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:48.552
I never would have figured you for
such a romantic. By all means.

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.510
- Maggie...
- Oh, I accept, Oliver.

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:57.478
I haven't asked yet.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:02.938
And since it appears I'm only
going to be able to do this once,

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:06.020
I'd like it to be done right.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.488
Oh, is your back
acting up again?

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:13.569
Oh, it's killing me.

01:16:13.736 --> 01:16:15.238
I can't believe I
climbed up that cliff.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.665
I mean, if I'd known I was
gonna get shot anyway,

01:16:17.698 --> 01:16:19.666
I could have just
rung the doorbell.

01:16:20.117 --> 01:16:21.494
These places even
have doorbells?

01:16:21.535 --> 01:16:24.288
Mr. Plexico, you're wandering.
It's too long, too long.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.877
Oh, sorry.

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:31.383
Oh, Oliver, my heart is
bursting with anticipation.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:33.259
What the
hell is going on?

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.927
Just keep stalling.

01:16:36.884 --> 01:16:38.101
Maggie.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:40.976
My beloved Maggie.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:45.355
Maggie of my dreams.

01:16:46.685 --> 01:16:48.653
Maggie, Maggie.

01:16:49.688 --> 01:16:51.156
Maggie.

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:54.861

Did I kill him?

01:18:21.822 --> 01:18:23.074
No, he's gonna be fine.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:24.784
You see, that injection he took

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.327
doesn't actually
make you younger,

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.412
you just feel younger
for a while.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.130
It's the ultimate high.

01:18:30.831 --> 01:18:34.927
Unfortunately for him, it's followed
pretty quickly by the ultimate low.

01:18:35.211 --> 01:18:36.929
We came up with the
exact same formula

01:18:36.962 --> 01:18:39.260
as Luis at the lab
about 18 months ago.

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:41.892
At least our guys could sing.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:44.762
How do you know so much?

01:18:45.304 --> 01:18:46.851
Never said I didn't go to MIT.

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:51.644
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:56.028
This is obviously not going
to be an ordinary auction.

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:59.201
I'm afraid there has been
an inexcusable mix-up.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:04.158
It seems that while I was selling this
magnificent bottle to Mr. Kelleher,

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:08.119
my son, Richard,
without my permission,

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:12.631
was simultaneously selling it to our
Greek friend, Mr. Spiros Nivanos.

01:19:13.832 --> 01:19:15.505
However,

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:18.383
I'm happy to be
able to announce,

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:21.928
that having spoken with
all parties involved,

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:26.096
everyone has graciously
agreed to an open auction.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:30.895
The bidding will
start at $1 million.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.729
And now, if you would take your
seats, ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.985
we should begin very shortly.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:40.488
How high are you gonna go?

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:44.201
Well, whatever it takes. That
bottle is going to Texas.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.244
How is your back?

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:49.293
Well, better than your head.

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.583
So, how much is your boss
willing to spring for it?

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:56.380
I have no idea. Mr. Nivanos
does not like to come second.

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:01.297
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

01:20:03.716 --> 01:20:07.141
Now, who will open the
bidding at $1 million?

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.812
One million two.

01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.390
One and a quarter.

01:20:13.225 --> 01:20:14.602
Two million.

01:20:19.565 --> 01:20:20.817
Two, two.

01:20:24.236 --> 01:20:25.488
Two, four.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:33.295
Two, five.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:38.004
$3 million.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:42.338
Bastard's got no sense
of the value of money.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.388
Three million, once.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.810
Three million, twice.

01:20:59.063 --> 01:21:00.110
$5 million.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.956
Mr. Plexico,

01:21:17.915 --> 01:21:21.795
I'm naturally not displeased
with your more-than-fair offer.

01:21:22.628 --> 01:21:25.973
But, how can I put
this delicately?

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.139
Can you afford it, sir?

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.222
Ask him.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.484
His mother founded the company.

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:39.694
He owns 80% of the stock.

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:45.863
I never said I was poor.

01:21:51.949 --> 01:21:53.371
Further bids?

01:21:54.785 --> 01:22:00.042
Then, sold to Mr. Oliver
Plexico for $5 million.

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.403
Oliver!

01:22:23.272 --> 01:22:24.774
Directly in front of
you, Miss Harwood.

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:28.160
I take it, you are,

01:22:28.819 --> 01:22:33.450
relatively speaking, well, compared
to the general public, well-off.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:36.368
I do okay.

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:39.042
Then why did you go
through so much?

01:22:40.956 --> 01:22:42.208
I enjoy the company.

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.719
Margaret, I'm proud of you.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:47.887
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:49.886
I'm afraid I have to
steal her for a moment.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:54.053
Here we are, this is the young
lady I was talking about.

01:23:05.731 --> 01:23:07.153
Oh, my God!

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.695
Oh, Oliver! You can't open that.

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:12.738
Why not? Napoleon would have,

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:14.406
he just didn't live long enough.

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:18.711
But it could be vinegar. I mean,
old wine often turns to vinegar.

01:23:19.328 --> 01:23:21.922
Well, then we either have
a wonderful glass of wine

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:23.878
or a really expensive salad.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:32.933
Consider this sort of a...

01:23:34.134 --> 01:23:36.353
Oddball engagement present.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:41.020
What do you say?

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:47.029
Oh, Oliver.

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:52.911
Oh.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:57.075
Well, how about we
celebrate with a toast?

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.167
Anyone would like to join us,

01:23:59.243 --> 01:24:01.587
the price is $10,000 a glass.

01:24:01.954 --> 01:24:04.127
Your personal checks will
be happily accepted.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:05.791
Make 'em out to your
favorite charity.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:07.171
Maggie, can we get some glasses?

01:24:07.251 --> 01:24:08.628
Oh, yes.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:11.471
Glasses, please.

01:24:16.843 --> 01:24:18.345
Thanks, buddy.

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:32.989
Maggie.

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:40.496
Doesn't look like vinegar.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:47.174
Doesn't smell like vinegar.

01:25:19.948 --> 01:25:21.450
Son of a bitch.

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:25.162
Exactly.
