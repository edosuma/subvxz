-Yeah.
-Did you go to the prom?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.458
Oh, I'm not gonna go into this.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.710
What was
his extra-curricular activity?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.086
He was a basketball player.
That's it.

one casualty from the evening.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.171
The chef yelled out
"irasshaimase"

16:46.255 --> 16:48.132
as I was pouring soy sauce,
and...

16:48.215 --> 16:51.218
it scared me, and-- and I...
got it on the shirt.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.928
Looks like you were a part
of a home birth or something.

spilled all over it.

on a fabric like this.

the company to replace it

17:07.151 --> 17:09.236

-Yes.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.914
Why would you loan me
your favorite shirt?

17:20.998 --> 17:22.499

and you were uncomfortable

17:22.583 --> 17:23.584

your favorite shirt.

would mean something to me
