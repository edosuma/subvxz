WEBVTT

00:24.442 --> 00:25.777
Wow.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.195
(SIGHS) Yeah.

00:47.632 --> 00:49.676
Come back to bed.

00:49.801 --> 00:51.928
Give me a minute.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.596
You get 20 seconds.

00:58.268 --> 00:59.728
(WATER RUNNING)

01:09.821 --> 01:10.905
(GLASS SHATTERING)

01:11.030 --> 01:12.824
Hey. What are you...

01:20.039 --> 01:21.291
(DIALING)

01:25.920 --> 01:28.131
Female, late 20s,
tonic-clonic seizure.

01:28.256 --> 01:29.174
Duration of the seizure?

01:29.299 --> 01:30.633
A little over
three minutes.

01:30.759 --> 01:32.343
Does your friend
have a history of epilepsy?

01:32.469 --> 01:33.678
She never said.

01:33.803 --> 01:35.430
My name is Dr. Cameron.
You're in a hospital.

01:35.555 --> 01:36.431
We're gonna
take care of you.

01:36.556 --> 01:38.475
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

02:11.049 --> 02:11.925
CAMERON: House?

02:12.050 --> 02:12.967
(EXCLAIMS)

02:14.052 --> 02:18.014
I have a case I think
you might be interested in.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.516
Not now.

02:21.017 --> 02:23.895
Twenty-six-year-old woman
had a tonic-clonic seizure.

02:24.020 --> 02:27.106
What about me speeding away
says to you "let's chat"?

02:27.232 --> 02:30.276
History of fatigue, and two years ago
she had a retinal vein occlusion.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.569
She's diabetic.

02:31.694 --> 02:35.031
No, she's not,
and she has no history of hypertension.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.242
It can wait.

02:37.367 --> 02:38.493
(THUDDING)

02:39.828 --> 02:42.664
I knew I should have set up
the video camera. Stay there.

02:46.501 --> 02:50.505
Oh, my goodness, I played
a practical joke on my best friend,

02:50.630 --> 02:52.715
and he's badly injured.

02:52.841 --> 02:55.635
Wish I'd learnt
this valuable lesson earlier.

02:57.095 --> 02:59.806
I was waiting by my window
for an hour. Why are you late?

02:59.931 --> 03:02.433
I had a breakfast meeting
at Mickey's Diner

03:02.559 --> 03:04.853
with the Mercy people
to tell them

03:07.730 --> 03:09.858
I'm coming back
to work here.

03:11.359 --> 03:15.488
Sorry if it interfered
with your plan to maim me.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.740
Donut's a nice touch.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.794
That's just my way of saying
welcome back.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.674
The seizure could be the result of
dehydration or something neurological.

03:34.799 --> 03:36.885
Or the Ecstasy
you found in her system.

03:37.010 --> 03:38.720
According to Dr. Hadley,
the patient took the drugs

03:38.845 --> 03:41.139
about five hours
before the seizure, so...

03:41.264 --> 03:42.557
How does Thirteen
know about it?

03:42.682 --> 03:45.059
Apparently,
she was with the patient last night.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.730
At 3:00 a.m.?

03:50.899 --> 03:52.775
Oh, yeah.

03:52.901 --> 03:55.486
Penthouse Forum
meets medical mystery.

03:55.612 --> 03:56.696
Maybe there is a God.

03:59.407 --> 04:02.035
Empty, transient sex?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.370
I've been waiting for you
to spiral out of control

04:04.495 --> 04:06.706
ever since you got
your Huntington's diagnosis,

04:06.831 --> 04:08.458
but this is more
than I dared hope for.

04:08.583 --> 04:10.168
The patient's seizure
resulted from dehydration,

04:10.293 --> 04:12.670
which resulted from
a cocktail of alcohol and ecstasy.

04:12.795 --> 04:15.715
- Mystery solved.
- Wait, were you doing drugs?

04:15.840 --> 04:17.258
Not diagnostically relevant.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.052
HOUSE: That's what
we're trying to diagnose.

04:19.177 --> 04:21.137
It's how steep of a spiral
you're on.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.514
Our patient hemorrhaged into
her eye two years ago.

04:23.640 --> 04:24.933
Also not diagnostically relevant.

04:25.058 --> 04:26.225
Retinal vein occlusion was fixed.

04:26.351 --> 04:27.769
Her doctor said it
was a venous anomaly.

04:27.894 --> 04:30.730
HOUSE: Is he in this room? Because if
he's not, I don't care what he thinks.

04:30.855 --> 04:32.857
Unless he's a she,
and she was there last night, too,

04:32.982 --> 04:34.609
in which case,
I care very deeply.

04:34.734 --> 04:37.070
What if the eye problem wasn't
with her vein, but with her blood?

04:37.195 --> 04:39.030
It would explain why she seized,
why she's always tired.

04:39.155 --> 04:41.407
She parties until 3:00 a.m.,
that's why she's always tired.

04:41.532 --> 04:42.492
Yet, you seem fine.

04:42.617 --> 04:44.786
She's visited four other doctors
in the past year,

04:44.911 --> 04:46.120
none of them found anything.

04:46.245 --> 04:47.956
She's a hypochondriac
who drank too much.

04:48.081 --> 04:49.540
Blood clots
could explain everything.

04:49.666 --> 04:54.420
Makes sense. Bone marrow's in overdrive,
too many platelets. Sorry.

04:54.545 --> 04:58.508
Thirteen, go stick a needle
in your girlfriend's pelvis.

04:58.633 --> 05:01.219
And, no,
that one wasn't a metaphor.

05:01.344 --> 05:04.472
Suck out some marrow.
That one was.

05:10.520 --> 05:11.813
I like to watch.

05:16.609 --> 05:17.735
THIRTEEN:
I can handle this alone.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.362
You've already handled it,

05:19.487 --> 05:20.697
that's why
you need a chaperone.

05:20.822 --> 05:24.742
Of course, I'm a very permissive,
understanding chaperone,

05:24.867 --> 05:26.786
so feel free
to ignore me,

05:26.911 --> 05:30.081
you know, if you're in the mood to start
kissing or groping or showering...

05:30.206 --> 05:34.002
You'll have to excuse Dr. House,
he mistakes immaturity for edginess.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.712
You're Dr. House?

05:37.255 --> 05:41.342
I assume my name came up last night
in the form of a moan.

05:41.467 --> 05:43.302
You had sex,
then a seizure.

05:43.428 --> 05:47.098
Could be a particular position
or activity that set it off.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.309
That sounds like a valid
medical theory, doesn't it?

05:50.435 --> 05:51.978
I'm really sorry,
just ignore him.

05:52.103 --> 05:55.815
Whatever you think we did, we did.
And then some.

05:55.940 --> 05:56.816
Lights on or off?

05:56.941 --> 05:58.943
You got a medical rationalization
for that one?

05:59.068 --> 06:00.903
- Light sensitivity could...
- On.

06:02.155 --> 06:04.532
Huh! Figured she had
more shame than that.

06:04.657 --> 06:08.411
She talk dirty, or make you rely
on vague hand signals?

06:08.536 --> 06:11.831
She's pretty direct
about what she wants.

06:11.956 --> 06:13.624
I'm learning so much.

06:14.834 --> 06:18.046
Okay, score the score,
scale of 1 to 10.

06:18.171 --> 06:19.213
Don't answer.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.465
(GROANS)

06:20.590 --> 06:21.799
Seven.

06:23.009 --> 06:24.969
Finally get one right.

06:28.347 --> 06:30.933
You want to investigate him
because he ate a donut?

06:31.059 --> 06:33.144
He claimed he had a morning meeting
at Mickey's Diner.

06:33.269 --> 06:34.520
Wilson loves
Mickey's Diner.

06:34.645 --> 06:37.398
He has the French Toast Tower
whenever he sets foot in the door.

06:37.523 --> 06:41.152
There's no way he would have come
to work wanting more carbs.

06:41.277 --> 06:43.446
He lied to me.
I need to know why.

06:43.571 --> 06:44.864
What do you think
you'll find out?

06:44.989 --> 06:47.325
I'm worried that
he might be a spy.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.036
He's been gone four months. You're
worried the friendship has changed.

06:50.161 --> 06:52.205
I'm just not sure
if he's working for Hirohito

06:52.330 --> 06:53.539
or the
New England Patriots.

06:53.664 --> 06:55.792
You played a practical joke on him,
he didn't laugh...

06:55.917 --> 06:58.127
I need something
to lord over him, a lie.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.671
...he didn't try to retaliate,
he moralized.

07:00.797 --> 07:01.923
He always moralized.

07:02.048 --> 07:05.009
And he always moralized and got even.
He hasn't fired back.

07:05.134 --> 07:07.470
Things always change.

07:07.595 --> 07:08.638
And that sucks.

07:10.389 --> 07:13.601
Yeah.
Find out where he was.

07:16.896 --> 07:20.149
THIRTEEN: I should've known it wasn't
a coincidence. I found your letters.

07:21.776 --> 07:24.362
You recognized House's name,
and you're the first patient I've seen

07:24.487 --> 07:26.405
who actually enjoyed
being accosted by him.

07:26.531 --> 07:27.865
I would've told you,
but...

07:27.990 --> 07:29.408
What exactly
would you have told me?

07:29.534 --> 07:31.452
That you slept with me
to get to House?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.830
That you've been trying to get him
to take your case for over a year?

07:33.955 --> 07:37.083
I'm sick,
no one even wrote back.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.334
You used me.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.293
You used me.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.920
My motives were clear.

07:41.045 --> 07:43.047
You might've figured out
my motives faster

07:43.172 --> 07:44.674
if you had bothered to ask my name.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.425
(SIGHS)

07:47.969 --> 07:51.639
I followed you to that bar
because I wanted to talk to you,

07:51.764 --> 07:54.475
see if you'd help me
get to House.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.729
I didn't expect you
to be so aggressive.

07:58.855 --> 08:00.022
Was that seizure
even real?

08:00.148 --> 08:01.774
Why would I fake
a symptom?

08:01.899 --> 08:04.152
It would just make it harder
for House to diagnose me.

08:04.277 --> 08:06.988
There's nothing to diagnose.
Your biopsy results are negative.

08:07.113 --> 08:08.990
Then it's something else.

08:09.782 --> 08:11.701
Get dressed.
I'm discharging you.

08:11.826 --> 08:14.287
House admitted me.
He obviously thinks...

08:14.412 --> 08:17.373
House is using you as an excuse
to stick his nose in my personal life.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.709
I'm tired
all the time.

08:19.834 --> 08:24.797
Some nights I fall asleep at 10:00
and wake up at noon, still tired.

08:24.922 --> 08:28.092
Every doctor I see,
tells me there's nothing wrong.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.802
And that proves what,
exactly?

08:29.927 --> 08:31.679
That they're wrong
or that you're wrong?

08:31.846 --> 08:33.222
(GASPING)

08:34.515 --> 08:35.850
Come on,
you expect me to believe...

08:35.975 --> 08:37.852
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

08:38.311 --> 08:41.022
Sit back, deep breaths.
Try and relax.

08:41.939 --> 08:43.983
Get the paddles,
she's gonna crash.

08:46.027 --> 08:47.195
Damn.

08:49.906 --> 08:52.658
<i>THIRTEEN: We had to use paddles
to stabilize the patient's heart.</i>

08:52.783 --> 08:56.412
Eye issue, brain issue,
now a heart issue,

08:56.537 --> 08:58.039
sounds like
a real case to me.

08:58.164 --> 09:00.374
Yeah, I get it. I was wrong.
Can we move on?

09:00.499 --> 09:02.960
You're just upset
because the whole time she was with you,

09:03.085 --> 09:08.841
she was thinking about my huge,
throbbing diagnostic skills.

09:09.634 --> 09:10.927
Drugs would
explain everything.

09:11.052 --> 09:12.470
This morning
you rejected drugs.

09:12.595 --> 09:14.055
That's when I thought
that Thirteen was right

09:14.180 --> 09:16.098
and I was just
jerking her around.

09:16.224 --> 09:19.227
Cardiac arrest means
she could be a serious user.

09:19.352 --> 09:21.187
- Great.
- What?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.150
That means that something she did
at my place set this off,

09:26.275 --> 09:27.443
either she brought
drugs in

09:27.568 --> 09:29.403
or she grabbed something
from my medicine cabinet.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.822
And that means my place
needs to be searched.

09:31.948 --> 09:33.824
Now, I'd be happy
to do that myself,

09:33.950 --> 09:36.577
but unfortunately, that would be
far less titillating for House,

09:36.702 --> 09:38.955
so he's about to come up
with some convoluted medical reason

09:39.080 --> 09:42.083
why I have to stay here
while he goes through my stuff.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.128
Patient's dad
had bypass surgery,

09:46.254 --> 09:48.214
means she's a candidate
for atherosclerosis,

09:48.339 --> 09:50.132
she needs an ultrasound.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.218
That was much less convoluted
than what you just said.

09:52.343 --> 09:53.302
I'm not giving
you my keys.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.929
If you want to do this,
I'm going.

09:55.054 --> 09:56.472
Who can pick a lock?

09:56.597 --> 10:00.476
I'll go. Make sure he doesn't
steal any underwear.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.396
(SIGHS)

10:04.730 --> 10:08.150
You're a disgrace to your stereotype.
Move over.

10:08.276 --> 10:10.403
Think you can pick
a lock faster than me?

10:10.528 --> 10:11.737
No need to pick.

10:13.322 --> 10:16.242
Nice.
Steal from your employees.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.660
Never.

10:17.785 --> 10:21.956
I had my dick make keys
when I hired him to dick up the team.

10:26.085 --> 10:29.880
I always imagined she'd have
a sex swing in the living room.

10:30.006 --> 10:30.965
Give me my key.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.466
Don't have your key.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.468
You expect me to believe
that you hired Lucas

10:34.593 --> 10:36.429
to investigate everyone
except for me?

10:36.554 --> 10:37.513
Waste of money.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.057
I already know
everything about you.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.476
Thirteen had her purse,
that's gotta be the patient's.

10:42.601 --> 10:43.519
Check it for drugs.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.938
I call shotgun
on her bedroom.

10:46.063 --> 10:49.942
You know that I stole a car
when I was a teenager.

10:50.067 --> 10:52.653
You know that my mom
has Alzheimer's.

10:52.778 --> 10:53.738
You know nothing else.

10:53.863 --> 10:56.574
Want me to have you investigated?
When did you get so needy?

10:56.699 --> 10:59.160
I'm not needy,
I just don't buy it.

10:59.285 --> 11:02.204
You always want more
information about people.

11:03.039 --> 11:06.625
Look where we are.
Purse is clean.

11:14.633 --> 11:18.554
Last night wasn't the first time
that Thirteen brought home some strange.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.848
- If you found her diary...
- No toys.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.017
When you sleep with the same person
over and over,

11:23.142 --> 11:24.477
that's when you need accessories.

11:24.602 --> 11:27.813
First time is plenty exciting
on its own. Unless...

11:32.526 --> 11:35.821
You think an asthma inhaler
could be used as a sex toy?

11:36.822 --> 11:40.242
There are ways of getting to know people
without committing felonies.

11:40.368 --> 11:42.828
People interest me.
Conversations don't.

11:42.953 --> 11:45.039
Because conversations
go both ways.

11:47.208 --> 11:49.251
- Like Thirteen.
- Like Thirteen.

11:50.711 --> 11:53.839
Brown recluse,
found it at your apartment.

11:53.964 --> 11:57.426
Their venom can cause seizures
and heart problems.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.970
Unless the ultrasound

Very refreshing.

is fascinating.

there wasn't potential.

14:48.806 --> 14:52.810
No. What does that mean?

It means it's not

about my personal life.

15:06.740 --> 15:09.702
Which you just wasted
with that comment about my comments.

15:09.827 --> 15:12.997
Low potassium means her heart problem
is a symptom of a kidney problem.

15:13.122 --> 15:14.373
What caused
the kidney problem?

15:14.498 --> 15:15.791
Could be

15:22.298 --> 15:24.008
Her kidneys don't filter
acid out of the blood,

15:24.133 --> 15:27.469
excess acid drives down potassium,
causes kidney calcifications.

15:28.721 --> 15:32.349
If it's RTA, all she needs
is sodium bicarbonate for the acid

15:32.474 --> 15:35.936
and surgery to remove
the calcifications. CT her kidneys.

24:08.740 --> 24:12.619
The treadmill test isn't gonna close her
airway, it'll make her lungs explode.

24:13.036 --> 24:15.205
(MONITOR BEEPING RAPIDLY)

24:16.623 --> 24:18.208
Her throat's fine.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.085
We made her airway collapse,
but it's not collapsed.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.130
You ruptured a cyst,
her lung collapsed.

24:24.256 --> 24:25.799
Breath sounds
on both sides.

24:25.924 --> 24:26.758
Move.

24:30.554 --> 24:32.597
Trachea's deviating
to the left.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.561
(COUGHING)

24:37.686 --> 24:39.229
(GASPING)

24:39.354 --> 24:40.814
(MONITOR STOPS BEEPING)

24:41.439 --> 24:42.607
Nice.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.198
KUTNER: Chest CT confirmed
multiple lung cysts,

24:50.323 --> 24:51.950
one of which burst
during the treadmill test.

24:52.075 --> 24:53.660
Luckily, Thirteen
figured out the problem

24:53.785 --> 24:55.287
and was there
to re-inflate her lung.

24:55.412 --> 24:57.581
Lung cysts plus all her other symptoms,
could be amyloidosis,

24:57.706 --> 24:59.875
which we can manage,
or pulmonary fibrosis, which...

25:00.000 --> 25:01.376
Thank you.

25:01.501 --> 25:04.004
My employees can take
care of it from here.

25:04.129 --> 25:05.463
We need to biopsy
the cysts.

25:05.589 --> 25:06.965
You fired me
because I screwed up.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.925
I just proved
I can pull my weight.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.094
All you proved is you know
how to make an entrance.

25:11.219 --> 25:13.013
House, she deserves another shot.

25:13.138 --> 25:14.556
She found the cysts,
saved the patient...

25:14.681 --> 25:15.849
Who wouldn't
have needed saving

25:15.974 --> 25:18.894
if Thirteen had shown up
to the differential in the first place.

25:19.019 --> 25:20.562
Give her job back,
House.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.731
Or what?
You're gonna quit?

25:24.191 --> 25:25.358
Go do the biopsy.

25:28.820 --> 25:30.238
I'm sorry.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.995
How much clearer do
I need to make this?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.883
What does it even mean,
dating a hooker?

25:50.008 --> 25:53.011
He's an idiot
with a messiah complex,

25:53.136 --> 25:54.763
savior to all
who need saving.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.765
That's why his first wife
had a wooden leg,

25:56.890 --> 25:58.558
his second wife
was Canadian.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.269
He's the one
who needs to be saved.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.395
From you or the ho?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.940
The ho's just using him
for his money.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.109
Wait,
it was a bad example.

26:08.235 --> 26:10.403
Normally, in these situations,
I'd follow the girl,

26:10.528 --> 26:12.530
find out something embarrassing
about her to show him.

26:12.656 --> 26:15.450
But since that's our
starting position...

26:15.575 --> 26:17.827
We proceed directly
to the leg breaking.

26:17.953 --> 26:20.830
I'm not breaking her legs,
she probably has a pimp,

26:20.956 --> 26:22.207
or at least
an older brother,

26:22.332 --> 26:25.043
or younger brother,
or overprotective sister...

26:25.168 --> 26:29.589
Find her. Find her family.
Find client number 9.

26:29.714 --> 26:32.884
Just get me something I can use
to force her to back off.

26:33.009 --> 26:35.845
Sorry to interrupt
your meeting, Mannix.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.515
Here's the result
from the lung biopsy.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.399
(DOOR OPENS)

26:51.820 --> 26:53.488
Why not men?

26:55.282 --> 26:56.616
You're bisexual.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.660
If you were just being
self-destructive,

26:58.785 --> 27:00.537
you'd be having
random sex with men.

27:00.662 --> 27:03.790
Better chance of getting assaulted,
catching a disease.

27:03.915 --> 27:06.876
If this were just
about getting laid,

27:07.002 --> 27:11.339
it'd be a lot easier
to pick up men or ugly girls.

27:11.464 --> 27:16.594
This woman's hot, which means
you like the challenge, the conquest.

27:17.470 --> 27:19.556
It's the control
that gets you off.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.850
And controlling women is
as close as you can get

27:21.975 --> 27:23.685
to controlling what's
going to happen to you.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.395
Here I thought
I was just into boobs.

27:25.520 --> 27:28.189
Instead of getting
sweaty with a stranger,

27:28.315 --> 27:31.151
why don't you try
taking it to the next level?

27:31.276 --> 27:32.694
Play God.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.864
Tell a girl
that she's got 10 years to live.

27:37.407 --> 27:38.658
She has LAM.

27:42.370 --> 27:43.830
(EXHALES)

27:49.085 --> 27:50.253
Okay-

27:50.378 --> 27:51.713
This is not a test.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.590
You're not getting
your job back if you can...

27:53.715 --> 27:55.592
I know what it's like
to get this news,

27:55.717 --> 27:58.303
and no one should
have to get it from you.

28:03.767 --> 28:05.226
(DOOR OPENS)

28:20.533 --> 28:21.701
Hey.

28:23.453 --> 28:24.621
(SIGHS)

28:27.332 --> 28:32.003
The biopsy of your lung cyst
showed smooth muscle cells.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.548
That's indicative
of a disease called LAM.

28:37.133 --> 28:38.510
What do you do for that?

28:40.136 --> 28:42.263
Surgery
to remove the cysts,

28:43.431 --> 28:46.726
but they'll come back.

28:47.685 --> 28:50.522
Little by little,
the cysts replace healthy lung tissue

28:50.647 --> 28:53.066
until your lungs stop working.

29:08.456 --> 29:10.417
I'm going to die.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.627
Yes.

29:20.385 --> 29:22.387
I'm so sorry.

29:25.723 --> 29:27.600
<i>THIRTEEN: They removed
all the cysts they could.</i>

29:27.725 --> 29:29.018
<i>That should help
you breathe better.</i>

29:30.728 --> 29:33.231
How long until
the cysts come back?

29:33.356 --> 29:36.818
We don't know exactly.
I'm sorry.

29:39.237 --> 29:41.156
Stop saying you're sorry.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.245
I know you're scared.

29:50.248 --> 29:52.750
(SIGHS)
I don't know what I feel.

30:01.551 --> 30:04.053
You're going to be numb
for a few more days.

30:04.179 --> 30:06.598
Then you'll go home
and cry for a few weeks.

30:08.558 --> 30:14.189
And then you get angry, start telling
yourself nothing matters anymore.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.401
You start doing
stupid things.

30:18.526 --> 30:22.071
Maybe you go out to bars
and pick up a bunch of women.

30:26.576 --> 30:27.660
You're...

30:31.331 --> 30:32.832
How long do you have?

30:34.751 --> 30:37.962
Maybe a little more than you,
maybe a little less.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.759
I'll race you.

30:55.730 --> 30:58.733
I was thinking maybe
I'd come back later?

31:00.109 --> 31:01.361
Sounds good.

31:11.287 --> 31:14.582
Oh, God.
What's going on?

31:15.416 --> 31:18.336
All her blood counts are down.
It's a new symptom, aplastic anemia.

31:18.461 --> 31:23.007
Does the word "fired" have some whole
other definition that I'm not aware of?

31:23.132 --> 31:25.426
I don't work for you.
Fine, don't pay me.

31:25.552 --> 31:27.470
Just let me finish
out this case.

31:27.595 --> 31:29.138
So you like her
now that she's dying.

31:29.264 --> 31:30.723
What happens
if she stops dying?

31:30.848 --> 31:32.267
FOREMAN: There's no danger
of that right now.

31:32.392 --> 31:35.019
If we don't figure out what's wrong
with her, she's got days, not years.

31:35.144 --> 31:37.021
TAUB: Aplastic anemia
takes LAM off the table.

31:37.146 --> 31:39.524
Unfortunately, none of our other choices
are any better.

31:39.649 --> 31:42.277
PNH with some sort
of respiratory infection...

31:42.402 --> 31:43.861
Best case
gives her 12 years.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.905
- Or fast-moving Langerhans.
- Few months.

31:46.030 --> 31:49.242
Or mastocytosis, which can cause
systemic shock and kill her in days.

31:49.367 --> 31:52.328
Go. Test for everything.
Not you.

31:54.664 --> 31:56.040
You're just a visitor.

32:01.671 --> 32:03.047
How's your patient?

32:03.172 --> 32:05.341
She doesn't
have Langerhans.

32:05.466 --> 32:06.384
That's good.

32:06.509 --> 32:09.554
Actually, a cancer diagnosis
would be good news right now.

32:13.141 --> 32:16.644
Do you think I'm boring?

32:18.187 --> 32:19.606
Yes.

32:21.149 --> 32:23.067
You're saying that
just to screw with me.

32:23.192 --> 32:26.779
Yeah. Why would you
expect anything else?

32:26.904 --> 32:29.032
I expect House
to pull my strings,

32:29.157 --> 32:30.908
I expect Cameron
to make me feel better,

32:31.034 --> 32:32.994
I expect the new team
to kiss my ass,

32:33.119 --> 32:36.164
and I expect you to be honest
'cause you don't give a crap.

32:38.583 --> 32:42.712
Yes, you're boring.
That speech was boring.

32:42.837 --> 32:44.130
Thanks so much.

32:44.255 --> 32:46.382
You don't let
other people's problems affect you.

32:46.507 --> 32:48.301
You don't let
your own problems affect you.

32:48.426 --> 32:50.970
And it's the screw-ups
that make us interesting.

32:51.095 --> 32:56.100
You're never out of control,
which is good and boring.

32:56.726 --> 32:59.270
Never losing control also means
you're never putting yourself out there,

32:59.395 --> 33:01.147
never pushing your limits.

33:01.272 --> 33:04.859
On the other hand, you do have a tattoo,
so maybe I'm wrong.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.453
I'm glad you're here.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.022
She needs
a bone marrow transplant.

34:25.148 --> 34:26.607
Test results are back?
What's she positive for?

34:26.733 --> 34:29.110
Nothing.
But we've got a donor match.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.112
Jumping to a transplant
when we don't know what she...

34:31.237 --> 34:33.156
I know she has
a blood disorder.

34:33.281 --> 34:36.159
Could be PNH.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

34:36.284 --> 34:38.119
Or leukemia.
She needs a bone marrow transplant.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.412
Or thalassemia.
She needs a bone marrow...

34:39.537 --> 34:40.496
Yeah, I get it.

34:40.621 --> 34:43.458
But she'll never survive
total body irradiation.

34:43.583 --> 34:45.126
So we don't radiate her.

34:46.669 --> 34:49.589
Her marrow's nearly wiped out already,
count is almost zero.

34:49.714 --> 34:52.300
"Almost" being the key word. The new
marrow would attack the old marrow.

34:52.425 --> 34:54.051
She'll die
from graft-versus-host.

34:54.177 --> 34:55.553
You got a better idea?

34:58.014 --> 35:01.058
She trusts you.
Go get her consent.

35:20.495 --> 35:23.247
Sometimes I find out things
you'd rather not know.

35:24.707 --> 35:26.250
This was in his trash.

35:27.919 --> 35:29.086
He's using.

35:38.763 --> 35:39.806
You're back.

35:41.849 --> 35:43.267
Genius.

35:44.477 --> 35:48.397
Damn, I knew the fake works
was too much.

35:48.523 --> 35:50.441
Well, you had no choice.

35:50.566 --> 35:53.486
Where were you gonna go
after fake-hooker-girlfriend?

35:55.112 --> 35:56.656
How did you know
he was outside?

35:56.781 --> 35:58.574
Cane prints.

35:58.699 --> 36:00.910
I'm actually kind of insulted.
No way I'm a drug addict

36:01.035 --> 36:04.956
but you completely buy
that I fell in love with a prostitute?

36:05.081 --> 36:06.749
You played
to your strengths.

36:06.874 --> 36:09.252
By which I mean
you played to your weaknesses.

36:12.421 --> 36:14.006
Oh, my God.

36:15.633 --> 36:19.220
You invoked your dead girlfriend's name
to sell me.

36:20.930 --> 36:22.098
You're my hero.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.433
Best $30 I ever spent.

36:24.559 --> 36:26.561
Thirty?
Did you keep her number?

36:26.686 --> 36:29.814
Unfortunately, I killed her
and buried her in the basement.

36:29.939 --> 36:32.191
Shame. Hungry?

36:32.900 --> 36:34.151
Yeah.

36:37.154 --> 36:40.616
So, seriously,
where were you the other morning?

36:40.741 --> 36:43.202
Oh, don't make me
do this again.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.580
It has nothing
to do with you.

36:45.705 --> 36:46.539
Then tell me.

36:46.664 --> 36:48.040
We're going bowling
on Monday.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.252
I'm coming over to play poker
this weekend. Nothing's changed.

36:51.377 --> 36:53.004
You have to trust that.

36:55.006 --> 36:56.299
Okay-

37:01.470 --> 37:02.471
(SIGHS)

37:02.597 --> 37:05.266
You're gonna keep following me,
aren't you?

37:05.391 --> 37:07.351
It's what we do.

37:09.770 --> 37:12.773
Be outside my apartment
at 8:00 tonight.

37:20.197 --> 37:22.241
She said yes
to the transplant.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.784
Good.

37:25.244 --> 37:28.956
You're in a downward spiral
of destruction.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.499
I can stop.

37:30.625 --> 37:33.586
You're gonna keep spiralling,
keep screwing around,

37:33.711 --> 37:35.713
keep slashing away
at every person who tries to help

37:35.838 --> 37:38.758
until no one
tries to help anymore,

37:38.883 --> 37:41.052
until you hit bottom,
until you're dead.

37:44.180 --> 37:48.517
But until then,
I can use you.

37:53.272 --> 37:54.690
You're hiring me back?

37:56.901 --> 37:58.361
You did good work.

38:05.076 --> 38:10.331
I did good work yesterday,
and I was still fired. What changed?

38:15.461 --> 38:18.339
You wanted me
to spend time with her,

38:18.464 --> 38:21.008
see if I could still
make a connection.

38:21.133 --> 38:24.136
You connected with the diagnosis,
not with her.

38:24.261 --> 38:26.973
You're trying to save me,
trying to control me.

38:27.098 --> 38:29.058
You're doing exactly
what you think I'm...

38:29.183 --> 38:30.393
Cracks.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.355
Your lips are cracked.

38:37.900 --> 38:40.444
Been using
your inhaler lately?

38:40.569 --> 38:44.156
Allergies.
Don't deflect, you always deflect.

38:44.824 --> 38:46.158
Did she cry?

38:47.910 --> 38:51.497
When you told her
that she was going to die, did she cry?

38:52.123 --> 38:54.000
She got upset, she...

38:54.125 --> 38:56.085
Were there tears?

38:58.546 --> 38:59.422
No.

39:05.261 --> 39:07.763
Chopping an onion
releases a mist

39:07.888 --> 39:10.558
of syn-propanethial-S-oxide.

39:10.683 --> 39:16.522
A chemical irritant which causes people
to have a very predictable reaction.

39:16.647 --> 39:18.274
She has no tears.

39:19.275 --> 39:22.194
It was either this
or put on <i>Brian's</i> Song,

39:22.319 --> 39:23.863
but I didn't have time
to stop by Wilson's.

39:25.531 --> 39:30.745
She has Sjogren's, that attacks the
glands that produce tears and saliva.

39:30.870 --> 39:34.957
It also, by the way,
causes lung cysts and RTA.

39:35.082 --> 39:36.584
It doesn't
cause bleeding.

39:36.709 --> 39:38.335
It's like you and men.

39:38.461 --> 39:40.713
Just because you usually don't
doesn't mean you can't.

39:40.838 --> 39:43.632
And it doesn't cause cracked lips
in other people.

39:43.758 --> 39:48.262
Lack of spit makes her mouth a breeding
ground for a fungus like Candida.

39:48.387 --> 39:50.556
Her asthma inhaler
did the same for you,

39:50.681 --> 39:53.476
wiped out
your mouth's immune system.

39:53.601 --> 39:55.811
So, she's got
what I've got.

39:57.146 --> 40:00.649
Just the opportunistic infection,
not the underlying condition.

40:03.194 --> 40:06.072
Another life saved
by girl-on-girl action.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.874
I'm gonna be okay?

40:19.085 --> 40:21.462
You're gonna be okay.

40:21.587 --> 40:25.633
Methylprednisolone to get
the Sjogren's under control,

40:25.758 --> 40:30.513
and some artificial tears to maximize
the visual impact of this moment.

40:42.942 --> 40:45.194
Spencer's gonna be fine,

40:47.238 --> 40:49.490
and I hear
you got your job back.

40:54.578 --> 40:57.039
I'm gonna keep standing here
until you say something.

41:06.340 --> 41:08.175
I feel alone,

41:11.762 --> 41:14.682
and she hasn't gone anywhere.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.728
She gets to live.

41:28.112 --> 41:31.323
I'm gonna go home.
I'm tired.

41:47.131 --> 41:48.632
What do you think?

41:52.511 --> 41:55.097
Oh, my God.

41:55.222 --> 41:59.643
You guys shop here, too?
Best nipples in Princeton.

41:59.768 --> 42:01.562
Why are you here?

42:01.687 --> 42:03.856
Because he ate the donut.

42:03.981 --> 42:07.443
I'm so sorry.
He must have followed me.

42:07.568 --> 42:08.777
I'm sure.

42:08.903 --> 42:10.487
HOUSE:
You're clearly not pregnant.

42:10.613 --> 42:12.573
So either
you're buying this as a gift

42:12.698 --> 42:16.619
or this is some kind of weird "if you
build it, they will come" moment.

42:16.744 --> 42:18.495
I'm adopting a baby.

42:18.621 --> 42:20.372
She asked me
to be a character reference.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.124
That's where I was
the other morning.

42:22.249 --> 42:24.877
I'm sorry,
I couldn't betray her confidence.

42:25.002 --> 42:29.048
I didn't want anyone else to know
in case I didn't get approved.

42:30.049 --> 42:31.800
Today, <i>I</i> did.

42:43.395 --> 42:46.106
Are you going to congratulate me?

42:48.734 --> 42:50.986
If you're happy, I'm...
