Perfect.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.268
Oh.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.154
You're gonna crush it.

00:55.156 --> 00:56.755
What could go wrong?

01:08.768 --> 01:10.369
Caroline and Tiffany.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.637
The seating cards should have
been placed 20 minutes ago.

01:11.639 --> 01:14.106
Come on, ba ba ba ba ba!

01:14.108 --> 01:15.741
Oh, have you gotten
one of us together yet?

01:17.111 --> 01:18.610
Ah, perfect.

01:18.612 --> 01:20.112
Emma, you done?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.180
Mom.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.614
It's too hot to function.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.116
I'm not the one

01:24.118 --> 01:25.117
who wanted to get
hitched in August, honey.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.453
Oh Mom, can you zip up Lucy?

01:27.455 --> 01:30.122
Oh my god is the air even on?

01:30.124 --> 01:33.192
They promised me a
crisp 68 degrees!

01:34.127 --> 01:35.527
Is this the kitchen?

01:35.529 --> 01:37.096
- Do I look like a
refrigerator to you?

01:37.098 --> 01:38.530
Go on, ba ba ba ba ba.

01:38.532 --> 01:39.765
It's down the hall to the left.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.467
Ask for Chef Souza.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.269
Where'd the twins go?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.871
We can't start
without flower girls.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.206
- Mom.
- What?

01:48.608 --> 01:49.541
Okay.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.543
Have you practiced
your vows yet?

01:51.545 --> 01:52.411
You know what?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.412
Say 'em to Grandma.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.413
'Cause I have to make a call.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.148
Is this the kitchen?

01:56.150 --> 01:57.382
Oh.

01:57.384 --> 02:00.552
- You better get lost
before it's too late.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.287
Something new.

02:02.289 --> 02:05.190
And it helps with
the nerves too.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.161
- The flutist isn't
texting me back.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.230
Can you help me, please?

03:33.213 --> 03:34.580
So.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.448
You sure you're okay?

03:39.752 --> 03:41.820
'Cause you kinda, look
look like you got stung

03:41.822 --> 03:44.256
by an emotional bee.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.492
But you look fabulous.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.627
That dress?

03:48.629 --> 03:49.561
Wow.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.598
- Mom's dress.
- I know.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.434
And it really stands
the test of time.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.868
Emma.

03:56.870 --> 03:59.838
- You're channeling like
1988 in a very strong way.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.873
That's a very underrated
year for fashion.

04:01.875 --> 04:04.409
You don't have to do this.

04:07.981 --> 04:12.384
- Look, I know it's a lot,
but you don't have to do this.

04:14.020 --> 04:16.922
And if you do want
to marry Charlie,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.690
then we'll just take a deep
breath and then we'll get

04:19.692 --> 04:22.327
right back out there.

04:22.329 --> 04:25.264
- You and I, we don't do
this, you don't have...

04:25.266 --> 04:26.798
I'm gonna be fine.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.302
You don't have to do this,
you have no obligation here.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.436
Oh I don't?

04:32.572 --> 04:33.972
Oh.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.574
Whew.

04:35.576 --> 04:36.708
Cool, see ya.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.666
This isn't the kitchen!

05:00.668 --> 05:01.900
It's me, dumb head.

05:01.902 --> 05:02.768
Come on.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.403
Albert to the rescue.

05:07.740 --> 05:09.508
Let's get outta here.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.849
Oh, this is the kitchen.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.018
Excuse us, sorry.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.353
Oh, that's actually,
hey thank you so much.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.954
- Emma, come on,

05:22.956 --> 05:23.889
Okay.

05:33.499 --> 05:34.700
Okay, alright.

05:36.569 --> 05:38.570
He's all yours m'lady.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.905
You want me to drive?

05:39.907 --> 05:41.940
You want me to come with you?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.875
Yeah, I can't go by myself.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.810
Wha...

05:46.779 --> 05:47.713
Okay.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.582
Why can't it open?

05:50.584 --> 05:51.750
- You have to reach in.
- What?

05:51.752 --> 05:53.952
Oh my god.
- Just reach in and pull the...

05:53.954 --> 05:54.820
- Why can't you just
have a normal car?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.054
Just pull it.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.690
He's not a normal
car, he's Albert.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.426
Alright.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.628
Why does it smell weird?

06:04.664 --> 06:06.732
What's happening?

06:06.734 --> 06:08.400
It's just...

06:08.402 --> 06:09.368
- Emma.
- Don't.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.535
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.070
Shh, Albert, come on!

06:12.072 --> 06:13.071
Albert?

06:13.073 --> 06:14.606
Ready, come on sweet Albie.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.975
It's okay, it's okay.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.511
Let's just, maybe
we should just...

06:19.513 --> 06:20.612
Nope.
- Nope, no,

06:20.614 --> 06:22.080

- Nevermind.

06:22.082 --> 06:22.948
Okay hold on.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.718
Wait wait wait,
hold on, hold on.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.625
Yes, Albert!

06:35.528 --> 06:37.796
Never let's me down.
- Wow.

06:37.798 --> 06:38.997
Alright, you ready?

06:38.999 --> 06:42.167
- Shh, just like be
really, really slow.

06:42.169 --> 06:43.402
Why are you shushing me?

06:43.404 --> 06:44.403
Be really quiet.

06:44.405 --> 06:45.604
People...

06:45.606 --> 06:46.505
- There's literally
no one can hear us.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.572
There are people.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.974
Emma, just, I can't be seen.

06:48.976 --> 06:49.975
Be cool, be cool, be cool.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.810
Be cool, be cool.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.078
- What if Mom finds out...
- Act cool dude.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.179
I am acting cool.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.814
You are not acting cool.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.182
Oh my gosh.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.116
Okay.

06:59.552 --> 07:00.485
Okay we do have to go
directly by the church so...

07:00.487 --> 07:01.686
Why are there people there?

07:01.688 --> 07:03.822
- There's people there,
you think they saw me?

07:03.824 --> 07:04.556
Oh my god they all saw you.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.724
Oh my god!

07:05.726 --> 07:06.591
- I'm just kidding,
nobody saw you.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.025
- Emma...
- No stay down.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.659
Okay.

07:07.661 --> 07:08.860
Oh god.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.529
Okay I'm down, I'm
down, I'm just...

07:11.999 --> 07:13.465
Oh my god, oh my god.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.666
- Why did you have
to make your wedding

07:14.668 --> 07:15.600
at like the busiest
time in the morning?

07:15.602 --> 07:16.735
I don't know why is...

07:16.737 --> 07:17.936
- There are so many
people, hold on.

07:17.938 --> 07:18.770
- Oh my god there
are so many people.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.771
Oh my god.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.173
Shh, shh, shh, be cool, be cool.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.207
It's okay, we're just driving.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.608
I know, I know.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.476
Oh my god.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.477
Okay we're past.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.845
We're past!
- Oh my god.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.132
- I think those have been in
my car since like eighth grade.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.676
I can't even cry right.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.946
What's happening to me?

09:40.948 --> 09:42.147
Okay, okay.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.249
It's like a weird cry laugh.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.585
That happens sometimes.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.254
Why?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.722
- I don't know, I think that
we should pull over though.

09:50.724 --> 09:51.890
- Okay.
- Yeah, you think so?

09:51.892 --> 09:54.859
I think that that would be good.

09:54.861 --> 09:55.961
We'll fix it.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.330
Gonna fix it.

09:58.332 --> 10:01.032
Okay, it's time
for the backpack.

10:03.803 --> 10:06.905
Do you remember
the breakup rules?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.907
- I created the
breakup rules for you,

10:08.909 --> 10:09.841
do you remember that?

10:09.843 --> 10:10.909
- Mm hmm.
- What's this?

10:10.911 --> 10:12.077
Rule number one.

10:12.079 --> 10:12.944
This is not part of the rules.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.880
Alcohol.
- Mm hmm.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.850
- Wait you just like
have that handy?

10:18.852 --> 10:20.719
Hey hey hey you're driving!

10:20.721 --> 10:21.653
Fine.

10:23.789 --> 10:24.723
Here.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.631
Ooh, okay, good.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.076
How long do you think we have?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.645
For what?

10:46.647 --> 10:50.715
- Until every friend and
family member hates me.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.885
Don't worry about it, okay?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.020
I handled it.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.058
I think I should call Charlie.

11:00.060 --> 11:02.727
Um, yes, you should.

11:02.729 --> 11:06.097
But first you need
your strength.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.098
Rule number two.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.967
- Chocolate.
- Mm hmm.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.002
Oh god.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.103
Oh god.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.038
Mm.

11:17.443 --> 11:18.376
My god.

11:21.113 --> 11:23.114
This is the best
chocolate I've had

11:23.116 --> 11:25.817
in a really long time.
- I know.

11:25.819 --> 11:26.751
Okay.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.356
You get one, very
short phone call.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.357
Mm hmm.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.860
I don't want us getting
deterred from rule number three.

11:35.862 --> 11:36.795
Mm hmm.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.765
Just give it to me.
- Okay.

11:42.101 --> 11:47.005
- You know, I can't do this
when you're looking at me.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.041
Right, no, good one.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.345
Okay.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.229
It's her.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.101
Millie?

12:16.103 --> 12:17.469
I'm so glad you called.

12:17.471 --> 12:19.738
I'm so nervous, you know?

12:19.740 --> 12:21.239
And how are you, are you okay?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.440
How are you feeling?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.242
It's a good thing you
didn't video chat me.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.944
Right, it's bad luck
to see the bride

12:25.946 --> 12:27.312
before the wedding
and all that, so

12:27.314 --> 12:29.080
I don't think hearing
your voice counts though...

12:29.082 --> 12:30.181
Charlie.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.183
Sorry, rambling.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.119
Yes, my darling bride.

12:34.121 --> 12:37.322
God you know soon
I can say wife.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.058
Okay hold on one second.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.860
He put me on hold.

12:42.895 --> 12:43.828
What?

12:45.131 --> 12:47.465
Thanks Charlie.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.134
Hey, sorry about that.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.269
Found some stray flower girls.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.537
So how are you?

12:54.006 --> 12:54.939
Millie?

12:56.175 --> 12:58.409
I... wanted to tell you...

13:03.849 --> 13:05.850
That I can't marry you.

13:09.822 --> 13:10.555
What?

13:12.091 --> 13:13.992
Millie where are you?

13:15.961 --> 13:18.296
I can't... I can't see you.

13:20.266 --> 13:23.935
I just wanted you
to hear it from me.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.271
- Millie what are
you talking about?

13:26.273 --> 13:27.839
Can you just tell
me where you are?

13:27.841 --> 13:29.307
I'll come to wherever you are.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.942
You know and you should
really see the sanctuary,

13:30.944 --> 13:32.343
it's so perfect.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.946
I feel like I can just see
us up there and the pews

13:34.948 --> 13:37.982
are wrapped in lavender,
it's your favorite.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.084
No I can't, I can't.

13:40.086 --> 13:43.388
I can't go, I can't
come back, I can't.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.390
- Of course you
can, you can do it.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.324
Mills.

13:47.393 --> 13:49.260
Remember junior prom?

13:50.329 --> 13:51.963
We were all dressed up
and they had it outside

13:51.965 --> 13:55.433
but it's May and May
means rain in Kansas.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.872
Yeah it poured so hard.

14:00.874 --> 14:02.607
- And we
just stayed in my car.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.276
- I thought we were gonna
get hit by lightning.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.145
- Just we
talked, you know?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.847
We talked for hours.

14:08.849 --> 14:09.581
Yeah.

14:11.150 --> 14:12.951
It was perfect.

14:12.953 --> 14:16.387
- Millie you
and I, we're perfect.

14:16.389 --> 14:18.556
Oh god Charlie.

14:18.558 --> 14:22.527
It just doesn't feel like
it's perfect anymore.

14:27.132 --> 14:28.333
- Millie all of these
people are waiting

14:28.335 --> 14:29.534
for us to get married.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.903
- Well this is about us,
this isn't about them.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.905
- If it's about
us then what's the problem?

14:33.907 --> 14:36.207
We're meant to be together.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.979
I don't know.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.116
I don't know about that.

14:46.986 --> 14:48.353
- I can't
believe this is happening.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.221
I can't either.

14:50.223 --> 14:51.256
- Can you just
tell me where you are?

14:51.258 --> 14:53.057
We need to talk about this.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.125
I'm sorry.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.303
Charlie I...

15:32.431 --> 15:33.364
So?

15:36.201 --> 15:38.569
I'm even more confused now.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.239
Okay well...

15:41.241 --> 15:43.207
There's no turning back now.

15:43.209 --> 15:44.709
The damage is done.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.483
I apologized to him.

15:52.485 --> 15:53.551
What?

15:53.553 --> 15:54.552
Ugh.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.653
Jerk.
- What?

15:55.655 --> 15:57.322
No.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.991
No he's hurting, just like me.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.460
I feel terrible.

16:05.664 --> 16:07.532
It's gonna be okay.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.369
Trust the system.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.375
Ooh, there she is.

16:18.510 --> 16:22.180
Alright, rule number
three, new look.

16:22.182 --> 16:25.483
So let's get you out
of this situation.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.453
Millie, how are you breathing?

16:28.455 --> 16:29.454
I'm not.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.356
Oh god Jesus Christ!

16:31.358 --> 16:32.290
Out, out!

16:43.035 --> 16:44.235
What?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.603
You couldn't have worn
these in the wedding?

16:45.605 --> 16:47.038
- Oh you couldn't have
worn these to the wedding?

16:47.040 --> 16:48.206
Hold that.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.640
- Why do you have
a ukulele in there?

16:49.642 --> 16:54.012
- You never know when the
mood's gonna strike, you know?

16:54.014 --> 16:54.746
No.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.216
What are these from your failed

16:58.218 --> 17:00.785
t- shirt for millennial business?

17:02.454 --> 17:04.454
I wouldn't say failed.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.455
You know what?

17:05.458 --> 17:06.691
You know what?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.059
I'm good.
- Dude it's clean.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.762
- It's been in the
back of Albert.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.198
These look like you.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.035
- Look, let's put
your ukulele back.

17:17.037 --> 17:18.336
This thing.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.503
- It's just a
beautiful brassiere,

17:19.506 --> 17:22.306
I don't know what your issue is.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.076
What are you...

17:26.345 --> 17:29.113
Serio... oh my god, you are
the prudest person ever,

17:29.115 --> 17:30.148
you know that?

17:30.150 --> 17:31.049
Okay.

17:32.384 --> 17:36.421
You're super covered now,
I can't see anything.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.623
- Hey.
- Hmm?

17:40.292 --> 17:41.526
What about Mom?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.227
Oh, don't worry.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.495
It's all handled.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.504
Come on, you know
what step four is.

17:53.506 --> 17:54.739
- What if I want to
look at them again?

17:54.741 --> 17:57.575
- No, no, you have
to delete it all.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.777
Out with the old,
in with the new.

17:59.779 --> 18:00.678
Yep.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.351
- Did these rules
even work for you?

18:07.353 --> 18:09.587
Because trying them
on for the first time,

18:09.589 --> 18:10.788
I gotta be honest.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.290
I think I may not have
known what I was doing.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.525
Just trust the system.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.094
Alright well...

18:18.730 --> 18:21.265
I'm sure you have a plan.

18:21.267 --> 18:25.336
- We are going to, wait
for it, Grandma's house.

18:28.540 --> 18:29.474
What?

18:30.409 --> 18:31.709
Yeah.

18:31.711 --> 18:32.877
Well come on.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.745
You've always loved
it at the farm.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.415
- No I really haven't,
I'm not a farm girl.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.283
- Well once a farm girl,
always a farm girl.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.552
- Except for I was
never a farm girl.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.822
That was always you out
with Grandma, you know?

18:44.824 --> 18:49.227
Playing with the chickens
and goats and fish, ugh.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.432
I mean is Grandma okay with it?

18:54.434 --> 18:55.500
Of course.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.436
Why, do you have a better idea?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.303
No.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.441
Oh god, it's Mom.

19:04.409 --> 19:05.543
Emma please, I don't want to.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.911
- I can't take it.
- I don't wanna take it.

19:06.913 --> 19:07.778
Please?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.847
No, I'm driving a car.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.317
Hi Mom.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.253
- Where in the
absolute heck are you?

19:15.255 --> 19:16.621
I'm with Emma.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.556
- Okay well that's great
but you gotta get your butt

19:18.558 --> 19:22.527
back upstairs, you've
got a wedding to perform.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.830
- You said that
you handled this.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.331
I did.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.332
I did.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.934
I did, I texted her.

19:30.903 --> 19:31.869
- You texted her?
- Yeah.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.504
You texted her?

19:34.406 --> 19:35.873
- Oh Jesus.
- What?

19:36.742 --> 19:37.708
Oh Jesus.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.876
What?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.579
- Um it didn't go
all the way through.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.648
Emma, are you kidding me?

19:43.650 --> 19:45.283
You are a nincompoop!

19:45.285 --> 19:46.651
Millie, Millie, Millie.

19:46.653 --> 19:47.785
What's going on?

19:47.787 --> 19:48.819
We're all waiting!

19:48.821 --> 19:50.555
I'm so sorry Mom.

19:53.759 --> 19:57.428
Emma and I, we can't... we
can't come back.

19:59.631 --> 20:01.566
I can't marry Charlie.

20:04.770 --> 20:06.804
Calm down, everyone calm down!

20:06.806 --> 20:07.805
Are you alright?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.373
Are you physically alright?

20:09.375 --> 20:10.541
Yeah.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.710
- Then what the heck
is wrong with you?

20:12.712 --> 20:13.878
Is this Emma's idea?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.479
No, no.

20:15.481 --> 20:17.815
Look I'm so sorry Mom, I...

20:17.817 --> 20:19.517
- You can save your
apologies for your prayers,

20:19.519 --> 20:20.718
Mildren Haven.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.852
Have you thought
about this at all?

20:21.854 --> 20:22.720
Yes!

20:22.722 --> 20:23.721
Of course I have.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.523
Really?

20:25.525 --> 20:26.657
'Cause it doesn't seem that way.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.993
Can you please keep it down?

20:31.663 --> 20:34.899
Honey, I know that this is
a very stressful day for you

20:34.901 --> 20:37.001
and it's also gonna be
the best day of your life

20:37.003 --> 20:39.971
and you've put me in a
little bit of a pickle.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.505
I'm sorry Mom.

20:42.674 --> 20:43.808
Have you talked to Charlie?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.443
How does he feel about all this?

20:45.445 --> 20:47.945
How does Charlie feel?

20:47.947 --> 20:50.982
Mom have you even asked me
how I feel, do you care?

20:50.984 --> 20:54.018
- Of course I do
sweetheart, it's just...

20:54.020 --> 20:55.653
You couldn't come up
with this revelation

20:55.655 --> 20:57.288
just a couple of months ago

20:57.290 --> 20:59.857
before I paid all the deposits?

21:02.828 --> 21:04.962
I gotta go sweetheart I
got a lot to do, okay?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.864
I'll talk to you later.

21:06.866 --> 21:11.269
Okay look, I am really...

21:11.970 --> 21:14.305
What the hell Emma?

21:14.307 --> 21:15.439
I said I'm sorry!

21:15.441 --> 21:16.641
No you haven't!

21:16.643 --> 21:18.309
Okay well I am.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.877
How's Mom, is she okay?

21:19.879 --> 21:21.479
Oh my god how is Mom?

21:21.481 --> 21:22.513
How about me?

21:22.515 --> 21:24.782
How about how is Millie?

21:24.784 --> 21:26.784
I just left my wedding.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.356
Hey Millie, how are you?

21:32.358 --> 21:35.026
- No, don't ask me now, I
don't want you to ask me now!

21:35.028 --> 21:39.864
- Shh, take some deep breaths,
just nice deep breaths.

21:39.866 --> 21:40.965
I know exactly what you need.

21:47.372 --> 21:48.873
This song?

21:48.875 --> 21:49.807
Yeah.

21:51.343 --> 21:54.412
- This is what you
thought I needed?

22:06.024 --> 22:06.957
Um.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.696
There's been a change of plans.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.696
Millie.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.798
Come on, quick pit stop.

22:47.800 --> 22:51.001
- Emma, no I'm really
not in the mood.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.138
Come on, it'll be fun.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.824
Yeah okay.
- Okay.

23:34.914 --> 23:35.780
Woo!

23:39.152 --> 23:41.419
Come on Millie!

23:42.422 --> 23:43.954
You gotta try this!

24:02.542 --> 24:04.875
- Look Millie, I'm
giving you some time.

24:04.877 --> 24:07.678
Just say the word and I'm there.

24:08.980 --> 24:09.980
I love you.

24:11.483 --> 24:13.751
I hope to talk to you soon.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.944
I applied to law school.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.145
In DC.

25:15.948 --> 25:16.881
What?

25:18.216 --> 25:19.149
No way!

25:20.519 --> 25:21.886
Do Mom and Dad know?

25:21.888 --> 25:23.087
No.

25:23.089 --> 25:26.557
I haven't told them,
I haven't told anyone.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.560
Oh Charlie would
kill me if he knew.

25:29.562 --> 25:31.829
He wants to put a down
payment on a house.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.297
Well he wanted to.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.802
But if I get in, I
would move in the fall.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.638
- Millie that is
such a big deal.

25:40.640 --> 25:41.672
I know.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.745
There is this historic
prosecutor who lectures there.

25:48.847 --> 25:51.916
I'd really like to
be the tough guy.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.285
You are a tough guy.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.121
Yeah, we'll see.

25:58.189 --> 25:59.990
- You're gonna be
a real grown up.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.592
I don't know about that.

26:01.594 --> 26:04.795
Charlie and I spent so much
time talking about Tupperware

26:04.797 --> 26:07.264
and sofas and cable providers.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.167
Mmm, cable providers.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.939
Sounds like such a sexy time,
I hope you used protection.

26:14.941 --> 26:16.140
Ha ha.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.042
- No really, I had this
one friend who dabbled

26:18.044 --> 26:19.610
in cable providers
and got a nasty...

26:19.612 --> 26:21.679
Okay, got it.

26:22.647 --> 26:24.315
It sounds nice.

26:24.317 --> 26:26.050
Yeah it was nice.

26:29.087 --> 26:32.089
Just wasn't what
I thought it'd be.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.129
Everything's different now.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.638
Hey remember our girl gang?

26:47.640 --> 26:49.340
- Yeah I still have
the lyric book.

26:49.342 --> 26:53.744
- Only the greatest punk
rock band there ever was.

26:55.046 --> 26:57.648
- Mom must have thought
we were actually insane.

26:57.650 --> 27:00.884
- Oh I will never forget you
in those platform sneakers

27:00.886 --> 27:02.319
telling her off.

27:02.321 --> 27:03.253
I object!

27:03.255 --> 27:07.725
Emma has as much right
to a crop top as anyone!

27:07.727 --> 27:10.060
You were a lawyer even then.

27:13.898 --> 27:15.699
Really proud of you.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.403
I haven't gotten in yet.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.404
You will.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.882
This is so weird.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.084
Emma, you and me.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.953
We don't talk anymore.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.368
- Steven used to be
obsessed with this song.

27:51.370 --> 27:55.305
Used to say that it
reminded him of me.

27:55.307 --> 27:58.776
- Yeah whatever
happened to Steven?

27:58.778 --> 28:00.110
We grew apart.

28:01.046 --> 28:02.446
I'm sorry babe.

28:07.786 --> 28:09.720
Dad made me a mix tape.

28:09.722 --> 28:11.255
- No way.
- Yeah.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.790
That is too good.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.859
- I don't think he
knew what to say.

28:20.231 --> 28:22.066
Dad's cheer up mix.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.005
Is it weird that I want one?

28:29.808 --> 28:31.975
It's mostly Patsy Cline.

28:31.977 --> 28:35.279
- Huh, Patsy Cline,
classy broad.

28:35.281 --> 28:39.483
- She's the patron saint
of country heartbreak.

28:51.130 --> 28:54.765
- Searchin' for
you, that's right.

29:08.113 --> 29:09.179
Girl gang!

29:17.255 --> 29:18.188
Ooh.

30:08.807 --> 30:11.041
So what are you thinking?

30:12.944 --> 30:16.246
- I was thinking a little
grape, maybe a little Pepper.

30:16.248 --> 30:17.581
Hmm.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.484
- Maybe finish off
with a little Sprite.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.920
See I'm a Sprite base.

30:22.922 --> 30:26.256
Orange, and hint of
lemonade guy myself.

30:27.058 --> 30:29.126
Wow, sounds very pink.

30:32.330 --> 30:34.164
- I'm comfortable
with my sexuality.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.499
I bet you are.

30:41.506 --> 30:42.506
Where you from?

30:42.508 --> 30:43.907
Kansas City.

30:52.617 --> 30:54.585
This is kinda gross?

30:54.587 --> 30:56.186
- You don't like
being kissed there?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.021
- No no I love that, this
place that we're in is

30:58.023 --> 30:59.890
a little bit gross.

30:59.892 --> 31:03.994
- Oh believe me, this place
is as clean as it gets.

31:03.996 --> 31:05.295
I'm only working
here for the summer.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.296
Uh huh.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.865
I'm saving up for med school.

31:07.867 --> 31:10.267
Stay with my uncle
over in Marcy.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.268
That's great.

31:11.270 --> 31:12.870
Do you know it?

31:12.872 --> 31:15.939
- Yep actually my grandma
lives there, oh my god.

31:15.941 --> 31:17.007
Oh no way!

31:17.009 --> 31:18.375
You guys close?

31:18.377 --> 31:20.110
Yes, we're close.

31:35.561 --> 31:41.164
So do you wanna go see
a play this weekend?

31:41.166 --> 31:43.100
The community theater's putting
up A Midsummer Night's Dream

31:43.102 --> 31:44.434
in the park.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.137
Maybe we could take a picnic.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.473
Um actually my sister's...

31:53.044 --> 31:56.446
You know what, I kinda thought
that this was gonna be like

31:56.448 --> 31:59.082
a quick fun thing so I should...

31:59.084 --> 32:01.351
- What?
- Yeah, I should...

32:01.353 --> 32:02.452
I should go.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.987
Oh wait, wait.

32:10.995 --> 32:14.298
Just let it be whatever
it wants to be.

32:18.504 --> 32:22.005
I was about to make
some very bad decisions.

32:22.007 --> 32:25.108
- Um yeah I was
just I had to pee.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.610
Oh that is a great idea.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.611
Here would you?

32:27.613 --> 32:29.613
I'm gonna go do that.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.548
Oh no no no no no no.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.016
I have no cash.

32:35.219 --> 32:36.486
Yeah so.

32:36.488 --> 32:39.256
- You brought vodka
and a voodoo doll.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.390
I know.

32:40.392 --> 32:41.992
- But you didn't
think to bring money.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.961
- Ah, stupid, so dumb but
you know could you just,

32:43.963 --> 32:46.530
do you mind just
getting this round?

32:46.532 --> 32:47.731
My purse is in the car.

32:47.733 --> 32:48.565
You know what?

32:48.567 --> 32:49.433
Oh my gosh!

32:49.435 --> 32:50.300
I just remembered.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.168
I have cash.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.103
I just spaced I guess.

32:53.972 --> 32:54.705
Okay.

32:56.007 --> 32:56.740
Weirdo.

32:58.176 --> 32:59.109
Thank you.

33:00.545 --> 33:01.611
Do you mind getting the gas?

33:01.613 --> 33:02.646
It's on number two.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.114
Oh sure yeah.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.148
You know what?

33:05.150 --> 33:06.516
Get something for yourself

33:06.518 --> 33:07.584
because it's your money.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.454
Classic.

33:29.674 --> 33:30.674
Ready to go?

33:30.676 --> 33:32.476
Yeah yeah all set.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.285
- What's up with you?
- Hmm?

33:42.287 --> 33:43.153
What?

33:43.155 --> 33:44.021
Nothing.

33:44.023 --> 33:45.322
It's so hot huh?

33:45.324 --> 33:46.256
Mm hmm.

33:50.095 --> 33:51.628
Albert.

33:51.630 --> 33:53.463
- He just needs
a little coaxing.

33:53.465 --> 33:54.765
- Oh no, he just
needed a new condenser.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.066
- Oh please, condenser
schmendenser.

33:56.068 --> 33:57.434
That's what he needs.

34:11.449 --> 34:12.382
What?

34:13.251 --> 34:14.184
Nothing.

34:17.554 --> 34:18.621
Oh my god!

34:19.524 --> 34:20.791
You are gonna get us killed.

34:20.793 --> 34:22.059
Oh man.

34:22.061 --> 34:22.726
What?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.261
What is so funny?

34:24.263 --> 34:25.795
- Nothing, you're just
like a testosterone magnet.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.531
Whatever.

34:27.533 --> 34:29.366
- No really, you
should teach a class.

34:29.368 --> 34:30.400
It's a skill.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.335
Oh please, shove it.

34:33.638 --> 34:37.373
- I might actually just need
your help with number five.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.109
Do something hot and wrong?

34:39.110 --> 34:40.277
Yep.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.812
Oh I got you.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.739
- I really
remember it being bigger.

35:42.741 --> 35:44.441
You are so weird.

35:44.443 --> 35:47.444
- Oh I don't want the
neighbors to hear us.

35:47.446 --> 35:48.612
That is ridiculous.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.147
Any neighbor is
like a mile away.

35:50.149 --> 35:51.581
You're being really rude.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.583
- I'm not the one
whisper yelling.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.785
Whatever, just be quiet.

35:57.588 --> 35:59.356
Ah, oh god!

36:00.425 --> 36:01.925
Who's loud now?

36:01.927 --> 36:03.326
Hi Macaroni.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.928
Do you remember me?

36:04.930 --> 36:07.197
- It's a chicken, it's
not gonna remember you.

36:07.199 --> 36:08.331
You don't know that.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.368
We were very close,
Macaroni and I.

36:11.370 --> 36:12.869
There are wolves here.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.238
Or coyotes or something.

36:15.240 --> 36:17.307
When does Grandma
get back anyway?

36:17.309 --> 36:20.844
- Oh she won't be here
for like three days.

36:26.350 --> 36:28.351
- Grandma's really gotten
into ceramics, huh?

36:28.353 --> 36:30.420
Yeah and cats.

36:30.422 --> 36:33.356
- I am really tired, you
wanna just go to bed?

36:33.358 --> 36:35.325
That is a great idea.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.469
Oh!

36:46.471 --> 36:47.504
What seriously?

36:47.506 --> 36:48.505
Finders keepers.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.673
What are we, six?

36:49.675 --> 36:51.975
I was just jilted at my wedding.

36:51.977 --> 36:52.976
- Ooh, I think that
you were the one

36:52.978 --> 36:54.778
who did the jilting.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.379
Oh I swear to god.

36:56.381 --> 36:57.914
- If you're so picky just
go sleep in Grandma's room.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.649
No, I won't.

36:59.651 --> 37:00.817
Why not?

37:00.819 --> 37:03.320
- Because I don't
wanna be alone.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.494
God.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.564
Oh my god.

37:14.566 --> 37:15.765
It is so hot!

37:15.767 --> 37:16.766
- I think the air
conditioning broke.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.868
Sweat out those toxins!

37:49.400 --> 37:53.270
- Hey baby, I'd
really love to talk to you.

37:53.272 --> 37:56.306
You know I never got to
see you in your dress?

37:56.308 --> 37:59.009
I tried to cancel our trip
with the airlines, I just...

37:59.011 --> 38:02.412
Anyways, Millie I'm
gonna give you time.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.581
But just say the
word and I'm there.

38:04.583 --> 38:07.751
I love you, hope to
talk to you soon.

38:20.831 --> 38:21.765
Emma.

38:28.006 --> 38:28.938
Emma.

38:33.345 --> 38:34.077
Emma!

38:35.012 --> 38:35.945
Gross.

40:02.133 --> 40:03.066
Hello!

40:33.098 --> 40:34.431
Oh my god are you okay?

40:34.433 --> 40:35.732
What's wrong?

40:35.734 --> 40:37.133
What?

40:38.136 --> 40:39.736
Emma are you serious?

40:39.738 --> 40:41.738
I thought something terrible
had happened in here!

40:41.740 --> 40:42.672
It did!

40:42.674 --> 40:47.177
- Oh my god, sometimes I forget
that you're still a child.

40:47.179 --> 40:48.211
- Oh my god, that's
a big spider.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.145
Grow up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.448
Come here little spider.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.182
Come on.

40:54.151 --> 40:55.218
There we go.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.922
Whoa.

40:58.924 --> 41:00.790
Speak for yourself.

41:01.759 --> 41:02.692
Bye.

41:05.162 --> 41:06.763
Okay I'm hungry,
let's go to Dolly's.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.131
What?

41:08.133 --> 41:10.967
No, no can we just stay here
for a little bit longer?

41:10.969 --> 41:12.802
No, I'm starving.

41:12.804 --> 41:13.736
Let's go.

41:15.906 --> 41:18.241
- I'm so tired.
- Oh my god.

41:18.243 --> 41:20.710
- I can't move.
- Thank you.

41:25.916 --> 41:27.617
Hey Mom.
- Hi honey.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.686
Did you get my texts?

41:29.688 --> 41:30.987
You holding up okay?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.188
Yeah.

41:32.190 --> 41:33.523
Yeah yeah yeah,
thanks for asking.

41:33.525 --> 41:34.824
Thanks for everything
by the way.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.025
Of course.

41:36.027 --> 41:39.062
I wanted to say I'm
so sorry I yelled.

41:39.064 --> 41:41.531
I was so stressed,
but you know what?

41:41.533 --> 41:43.066
We worked it all out
and everyone took home

41:43.068 --> 41:45.735
a mini cupcake so all
was not lost, right?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.670
Oh well that's nice.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.072
Yeah.

41:49.074 --> 41:50.540
Where are you?

41:50.542 --> 41:51.608
Do you want me to
come be with you?

41:51.610 --> 41:52.642
No.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.110
No no no no.

41:54.112 --> 41:57.146
I just... I need some
space, you know?

41:57.148 --> 41:58.882
We're at Grandma's.

42:00.551 --> 42:02.552
- I remember when
your dad and I split.

42:02.554 --> 42:04.954
I went to Orlando for a week.

42:13.097 --> 42:14.831
Have you seen Charlie?

42:14.833 --> 42:17.000
- Yeah, I saw him
right as he was leaving.

42:17.002 --> 42:18.835
And, how is he, is he okay?

42:18.837 --> 42:20.303
Uh... yeah?

42:21.572 --> 42:22.739
I guess.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.874
How okay could he be?

42:24.876 --> 42:27.777
I don't understand what
happened between you two.

42:27.779 --> 42:28.711
Honestly.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.915
- We just weren't
meant to be, Mom.

42:31.917 --> 42:35.752
- Okay, you
just seemed so happy.

42:35.754 --> 42:37.687
And honey you know all
I want in the world

42:37.689 --> 42:38.922
is your happiness, right?

42:38.924 --> 42:40.823
Uh yeah, I know.

42:40.825 --> 42:43.693
- Good, good
sweetheart, I'm glad.

42:43.695 --> 42:45.895
Hey how's Emma, are
you guys getting along?

42:45.897 --> 42:48.231
- She's good.
- Good.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.966
- No she's great, she's
taking good care of me.

42:49.968 --> 42:51.868
Really?

42:51.870 --> 42:53.069
Oh!

42:53.071 --> 42:54.270
I didn't get a
chance to tell you.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.039
Do not let her drive, okay?

42:56.041 --> 42:57.640
What?

42:57.642 --> 42:59.208
- Yeah she
can't drive right now.

42:59.210 --> 43:00.843
You gotta be kidding me, why?

43:00.845 --> 43:03.346
- She got a DUI and
her license was suspended.

43:03.348 --> 43:04.614
Mom.

43:04.616 --> 43:05.715
She can't know you know.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.650
She's so embarrassed by it.

43:07.652 --> 43:09.352
Just insist on
driving, okay lovey?

43:09.354 --> 43:11.187
- Mom, she drove me
the whole way here.

43:11.189 --> 43:12.355
What?

43:12.357 --> 43:13.923
Millie how could
you let that happen?

43:13.925 --> 43:16.025
- Well you could have
told me something earlier!

43:16.027 --> 43:18.294
- I've had quite a
bit on my plate, missy.

43:18.296 --> 43:19.963
Someone walked out on her
wedding and created a madhouse

43:19.965 --> 43:23.166
of 200 heartbroken people
and I can't get my refund

43:23.168 --> 43:24.734
from Chef Souza.
- Okay okay okay.

43:24.736 --> 43:27.303
I'm sorry, okay.
- Okay, alright, thank you.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.739
Thank you, I appreciate that.

43:41.285 --> 43:42.852
I'm on the phone!

43:43.954 --> 43:45.922
I'm not really hungry,
you'll know when I am.

43:45.924 --> 43:49.659
Chicken breast and a salad,
dressing on the side.

43:49.661 --> 43:52.929
Oh wait no you know
what I want some...

43:52.931 --> 43:54.330
- Hey Mom?
- Yeah?

43:56.333 --> 43:57.800
Yeah, I'm here.

43:59.336 --> 44:00.737
- How did you know
that you and Dad

44:00.739 --> 44:03.339
couldn't be together anymore?

44:03.341 --> 44:07.744
- Well I guess we just
weren't meant to be, honey.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.149
Thank you.

44:13.151 --> 44:15.184
You're welcome baby.

44:15.186 --> 44:17.720
Take care of yourself, okay?

44:18.422 --> 44:20.023
Promise?

44:20.025 --> 44:20.957
Yeah.

44:23.193 --> 44:24.394
Oh Mom.
- Yeah?

44:26.664 --> 44:27.397
What?

44:27.399 --> 44:33.236
- Um... do you think you might
be able to go to our apartment

44:33.238 --> 44:35.204
and get my mail?

44:35.206 --> 44:36.973
Maybe send anything
that looks important?

44:36.975 --> 44:39.142
Or just call, you
know, whatever.

44:39.144 --> 44:41.678
Whatever's easiest, I just...

44:41.680 --> 44:44.347
I don't really
wanna ask Charlie.

44:46.116 --> 44:49.218
- Sure, of
course I can sweetie.

44:49.220 --> 44:50.153
Thanks.

44:52.122 --> 44:54.257
I love you.

44:54.259 --> 44:55.692
I love you.

44:55.694 --> 44:56.426
Bye.
- Bye.

45:06.770 --> 45:08.905
Okay, I'm ready.

45:10.407 --> 45:12.008
You can't wear that.

45:12.010 --> 45:13.176
Why?

45:13.178 --> 45:14.343
This is like my
most popular shirt.

45:14.345 --> 45:16.479
- Yeah you're gonna
have to change.

45:28.826 --> 45:30.093
Is it better?

45:32.162 --> 45:33.096
Sure.

45:35.232 --> 45:36.899
Oh bye Macaroni.

45:39.002 --> 45:40.103
That's a different chicken.

45:40.105 --> 45:42.505
They're all Macaroni to me.

45:43.774 --> 45:45.208
- That's okay I
got it, I'll drive.

45:45.210 --> 45:47.443
- Oh please, you're
in a weakened state.

45:47.445 --> 45:48.911
You've driven plenty.

45:48.913 --> 45:51.114
No really, I don't mind.

45:52.783 --> 45:53.516
Don't...

45:54.752 --> 45:56.886
Don't be a child, Emma.

46:00.324 --> 46:03.025
Look I didn't want to say this.

46:03.927 --> 46:05.261
But Mom told me.

46:07.297 --> 46:08.231
Oh.

46:09.366 --> 46:12.168
That's none of your business.

46:12.170 --> 46:13.870
What happened?

46:13.872 --> 46:15.905
You're not an idiot, why
would you drive drunk?

46:15.907 --> 46:18.541
It's not what you think.

46:18.543 --> 46:19.942
You lied.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.544
And we had a bottle
of vodka in the car,

46:21.546 --> 46:23.913
that's really messed up Emma.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.281
I'm a good driver.

46:25.283 --> 46:28.484
- That's not the point.
- I know.

46:28.486 --> 46:29.919
You put yourself at risk.

46:29.921 --> 46:32.054
You really need to think
about what you're doing.

46:32.056 --> 46:34.557
- I was thinking that I
was taking care of you.

46:34.559 --> 46:37.293
- I don't need you
to take care of me.

46:37.295 --> 46:39.028
Yeah clearly not.

46:58.849 --> 47:01.450
- Carl, keep
that bacon coming.

47:03.254 --> 47:05.555
Yes, three bars, finally.

47:11.161 --> 47:12.094
Well.

47:13.163 --> 47:16.299
What can I get you
ladies this morning?

47:19.604 --> 47:21.137
Emma!
- Hi Dolly!

47:23.307 --> 47:24.240
Millie.

47:27.144 --> 47:30.947
Well I understand you're
a married lady now.

47:32.015 --> 47:33.850
It didn't work out.

47:35.252 --> 47:36.185
Oh.

47:37.287 --> 47:39.555
You know what they say.

47:39.557 --> 47:42.158
They say breakfast
makes anything better.

47:43.261 --> 47:44.460
- Amen.
- Amen.

47:45.896 --> 47:48.264
And y'all looking so pretty.

47:48.266 --> 47:50.399
Why wasn't that long ago
that you all were in here

47:50.401 --> 47:53.369
bouncing up and
down on the tables.

47:55.572 --> 47:56.505
I know.

47:57.608 --> 48:00.977
Two Dolly specials
and hot apple pie.

48:00.979 --> 48:03.112
- That sounds nice.
- Absolutely.

48:03.114 --> 48:04.113
Absolutely?

48:04.115 --> 48:05.882
Absolutely.

48:05.884 --> 48:07.483
Coming right up ladies.

48:07.485 --> 48:08.985
Thanks Dolly.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.457
- Emma, if Dolly knows
that means the whole town

48:14.459 --> 48:16.225
is gonna know.

48:16.227 --> 48:18.160
You don't know that.

48:20.530 --> 48:21.464
What?

48:21.466 --> 48:23.232
Marcy Swap and Shop.

48:23.234 --> 48:25.668
Mildren Haven seeks new groom.

48:25.670 --> 48:26.602
You've gotta be kidding me.

48:27.972 --> 48:28.905
I am.

48:30.207 --> 48:31.941
Emma could you...

48:32.609 --> 48:33.976
Could you please put that away?

48:33.978 --> 48:36.679
This is actually
really hard for me.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.421
What?

48:45.423 --> 48:47.290
Everyone is staring at me.

48:47.292 --> 48:50.593
- Nobody here gives
a hoot about you.

48:50.595 --> 48:51.694
Wow thanks.

48:53.597 --> 48:55.665
Tough love, baby dove.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.367
- Should I call Charlie?
- What?

48:58.369 --> 49:00.036
Just you know check in.

49:00.038 --> 49:01.237
No, no!

49:01.239 --> 49:02.505
You don't leave a man
at the alter and then

49:02.507 --> 49:04.674
grovel at his feet.

49:04.676 --> 49:06.275
Woman up, Millie.

49:11.548 --> 49:14.417
I think you should
take that off.

49:46.416 --> 49:47.350
Ah.

49:50.587 --> 49:51.520
Okay.

49:53.223 --> 49:55.358
I think we should play a game.

49:55.360 --> 49:57.026
- A game?
- Mm hmm.

49:57.028 --> 49:59.095
It's called tiny thefts.

50:00.097 --> 50:01.564
Okay.

50:01.566 --> 50:02.631
Here's how it goes.

50:02.633 --> 50:05.768
We each do a lap
around the diner

50:05.770 --> 50:08.304
on our way to the
restroom or whatever.

50:08.306 --> 50:12.675
And we steal something small,
we bring it back to the table

50:12.677 --> 50:15.478
and we compare and whoever
stole the best thing

50:15.480 --> 50:16.645
gets a prize.

50:17.781 --> 50:19.281
- Emma I'm not gonna
steal something.

50:19.283 --> 50:20.616
- You don't know
what the prize is.

50:20.618 --> 50:21.584
Okay, what's the prize?

50:21.586 --> 50:24.186
One million dollars.

50:24.188 --> 50:25.388
No it's not.

50:27.057 --> 50:29.392
- Winner gets to drive.
- No.

50:32.429 --> 50:33.396
Top bunk.

50:38.168 --> 50:39.301
- Okay.
- Yes.

50:41.204 --> 50:42.405
Tiny thefts.

50:43.306 --> 50:44.206
You go first.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.674
No no no no.

50:45.676 --> 50:47.309
No nubes go first.

50:47.311 --> 50:50.346
- You literally just made this
game up, how are there rules?

50:50.348 --> 50:52.381
- Oh and it has to fit
in the palm of your hand.

50:52.383 --> 50:53.382
What, are you kidding me?

50:53.384 --> 50:55.317
These are the rules.

51:01.625 --> 51:02.691
Excuse me.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.542
Can you eat something else?

51:19.544 --> 51:21.377
- Yeah, of course I
can eat something else,

51:21.379 --> 51:22.678
I always can eat something else.

51:23.681 --> 51:24.847
How about them Belgian waffles?

51:24.849 --> 51:26.115
What are you thinking?

51:26.117 --> 51:27.349
No man, I'm too full.

51:27.351 --> 51:28.651
Some key lime pie?

51:28.653 --> 51:30.786
You don't need any more.

51:30.788 --> 51:33.322
- Oh my god, oh
my god, I did it!

51:33.324 --> 51:34.423
- Real suave.
- I did it!

51:34.425 --> 51:35.691
Is that a wallet?

51:35.693 --> 51:38.661
- No no no no, you're supposed
to steal something small

51:38.663 --> 51:40.596
like a salt shaker or something.

51:40.598 --> 51:41.764
What?

51:41.766 --> 51:42.698
- Yeah no what happens
when these people

51:42.700 --> 51:43.799
wanna pay for their check?

51:43.801 --> 51:44.733
Oh yeah.

51:46.269 --> 51:47.536
You have to go put that back.

51:47.538 --> 51:51.340
- Well I haven't gone yet, and
I'm pretty sure I would win

51:51.342 --> 51:52.508
because I wouldn't do
something that would get us...

51:52.510 --> 51:53.642
Oh definitely not.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.677
Oh you have no idea.

51:54.679 --> 51:55.811
- You can't even
just let me win.

51:55.813 --> 51:57.179
There's so many tiny things!

51:57.181 --> 51:58.614
- It was your stupid
idea in the first place!

51:58.616 --> 51:59.815
- My stupid idea wasn't
to steal somebody's money

51:59.817 --> 52:01.150
it was just to
steal somebody's...

52:01.152 --> 52:02.651
- Do you like me?
- I guess I like you.

52:02.653 --> 52:03.886
- You're prettier
than me, take it.

52:03.888 --> 52:05.287
That is insane, I am not...

52:05.289 --> 52:06.622
- Take it.
- Why?

52:10.827 --> 52:12.495
Excuse me ma'am.

52:13.730 --> 52:16.799
Were you just over
there by my mama?

52:17.868 --> 52:20.169
Seems like we're
missing something.

52:20.171 --> 52:21.704
I...

52:21.706 --> 52:25.741
- Now I'm gonna ask you
nicely to give it back!

52:25.743 --> 52:27.409
You know we're good people.

52:27.411 --> 52:30.713
There wasn't much
money in there anyways.

52:38.188 --> 52:39.255
Oh my god!

52:41.191 --> 52:42.191
What's wrong with her?

52:42.193 --> 52:43.192
I'm so sorry, here.

52:43.194 --> 52:44.693
Thank you.

52:44.695 --> 52:46.462
- She just left a
man at the alter

52:46.464 --> 52:49.198
and they've been together
for almost a decade.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.232
- Oh my god.
- I know.

52:50.234 --> 52:51.300
Oh my god.

52:52.435 --> 52:54.203
Honey I'm so sorry.

52:54.205 --> 52:55.671
I'm so sorry, that's so sad.

52:55.673 --> 52:56.672
So sad.

52:56.674 --> 52:57.706
I mean.

52:57.708 --> 53:02.845
I... you... this was... I... I feel
guilty like for everything.

53:05.649 --> 53:06.882
And I don't know...

53:06.884 --> 53:09.285
- No no no it's not
your fault sweetie.

53:09.287 --> 53:10.486
He sounds like a real loser.

53:13.224 --> 53:14.557
You really spooked us.

53:14.559 --> 53:16.825
You can't go around
stealing people's wallets.

53:16.827 --> 53:17.760
I know!

53:18.562 --> 53:19.562
I don't do that.

53:19.564 --> 53:20.629
We're not stealers.

53:20.631 --> 53:21.564
- Not usually, no.
- No.

53:21.566 --> 53:24.500
You look like you need a hug.

53:24.502 --> 53:25.634
She does!

53:25.636 --> 53:27.236
- I don't want a
hug, I don't think...

53:27.238 --> 53:30.306
Stanley, what are you doing?

53:30.308 --> 53:31.373
Can't believe you.

53:31.375 --> 53:32.374
You take care, alright?

53:32.376 --> 53:33.742
Okay, we'll do that sir.

53:33.744 --> 53:35.611
Two Dolly specials.

53:36.813 --> 53:39.448
Hot apple pie coming up next.

53:40.317 --> 53:42.284
Thank you Dolly.

53:42.286 --> 53:43.886
You girls take your time.

53:43.888 --> 53:45.487
It's so good to see you.

53:45.489 --> 53:46.655
Yes.

53:46.657 --> 53:47.923
- Don't steal my salt
shakers now hear?

53:47.925 --> 53:49.425
Oh, one time.

53:58.435 --> 53:59.368
You win.

54:04.808 --> 54:06.942
Well, I'm about ready for a nap.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.944
- A nap?
- Mm hmm.

54:08.946 --> 54:12.414
- I'm still like shaking,
I'm like physically shaking.

54:12.416 --> 54:13.349
Um...

54:15.352 --> 54:16.685
What?

54:16.687 --> 54:17.820
No.
- Please?

54:17.822 --> 54:18.787
No.

54:18.789 --> 54:19.555
No way.
- Please.

54:19.557 --> 54:20.456
I'm wrecked.

54:20.458 --> 54:21.290
No.
- Please?

54:21.292 --> 54:21.957
Please?

54:21.959 --> 54:22.825
Please?

54:22.827 --> 54:23.759
Please?

54:23.761 --> 54:26.528
I really hate the puppy face.

54:26.530 --> 54:27.663
I've never like the puppy...

54:27.665 --> 54:28.430
- Please please
please please please.

54:28.432 --> 54:29.431
Go, please go.

54:29.433 --> 54:30.299
- Really?
- Yes, go.

54:30.301 --> 54:31.533
Hooray!

54:31.535 --> 54:33.736
Today is the greatest day.

54:33.738 --> 54:34.870
Don't fall.

54:36.640 --> 54:37.673
Sorry.

54:37.675 --> 54:38.607
Sorry.

54:40.477 --> 54:41.610
Hello.

54:41.612 --> 54:42.544
Welcome.

54:49.753 --> 54:51.520
Can I help you find something?

54:51.522 --> 54:53.322
I'm just browsing.

54:53.957 --> 54:55.524
Are you guys sisters?

54:55.526 --> 54:56.992
Yeah.

54:56.994 --> 54:58.927
She has great taste.

55:00.730 --> 55:03.966
I think I can help
you find something.

55:03.968 --> 55:04.967
Do you need a fitting room?

55:04.969 --> 55:06.635
Found it!

55:13.643 --> 55:17.546
- I think these would
work perfectly for you.

55:18.348 --> 55:19.715
Okay.

55:19.717 --> 55:22.618
Oh that is so your style.

55:22.620 --> 55:23.852
Thank you.

55:23.854 --> 55:24.887
Did you find some stuff?

55:24.889 --> 55:26.088
- Yeah.
- Good.

55:28.491 --> 55:31.093
Let me know if I can help you.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.040
Hey Mills!

55:45.042 --> 55:47.009
We doing okay in there?

55:48.044 --> 55:49.511
- You know nothing puts
a smile on your face

55:49.513 --> 55:51.347
like a nice new outfit.

55:51.349 --> 55:52.915
That's so true.

55:52.917 --> 55:55.117
He really knows his stuff.

56:02.759 --> 56:03.859
Yeah let's go.

56:03.861 --> 56:05.127
Are you okay?

56:05.995 --> 56:06.995
I'm fine.

56:07.897 --> 56:09.832
Don't I look fine?

56:09.834 --> 56:12.501
- I actually have a few
more things to try on so...

56:12.503 --> 56:13.502
Fantastic.

56:13.504 --> 56:15.070
I will meet you back at the car.

56:15.072 --> 56:17.072
- Okay, one moment,
I'm so sorry.

56:17.074 --> 56:18.707
Hey hey hey hey hey hey.

56:18.709 --> 56:20.075
What's going on?

56:20.077 --> 56:20.943
What's going on?

56:20.945 --> 56:22.544
Yeah.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.947
- This is great, I am just
having a fantastic time.

56:24.949 --> 56:27.583
- I thought that you
would want a chance

56:27.585 --> 56:29.017
to change out of my shorts

56:29.019 --> 56:30.419
and that this would be fun.

56:30.421 --> 56:31.520
Yeah.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.522
That's, sure, right.

56:33.524 --> 56:35.958
- You are acting
like a crazy person.

56:35.960 --> 56:37.926
Well aren't you just perfect?

56:37.928 --> 56:40.462
- Millie, I just
want to help you.

56:40.464 --> 56:42.164
Okay, I really do, and
I'm kind of at a loss.

56:42.166 --> 56:43.165
I don't know what
you want from me

56:43.167 --> 56:44.433
so what do want from me, what?

56:44.435 --> 56:45.501
I just, stop, stop!

56:45.503 --> 56:46.702
I want you to leave me alone.

56:46.704 --> 56:48.103
Okay, I can do that.

56:48.105 --> 56:50.172
I'm gonna buy some clothes
so I can keep some semblance

56:50.174 --> 56:51.039
of being a human being.

56:51.041 --> 56:52.441
Fantastic.

56:52.443 --> 56:52.975
- Awesome, do you wanna
go get some groceries?

56:52.977 --> 56:54.109
I can do that.

56:54.111 --> 56:57.546
- Great, I know you can.
- Great, awesome.

57:01.117 --> 57:03.652
- Are you going to buy
that dress as well?

57:03.654 --> 57:04.853
You should.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.455
Thank you, yes.

57:07.657 --> 57:08.857
Hi, welcome.

57:20.937 --> 57:22.571
You find everything?

57:22.573 --> 57:23.539
Uh, yeah.

57:35.518 --> 57:38.520
I heard this is a good time.

57:38.522 --> 57:40.055
Yeah, it's great.

57:43.493 --> 57:44.593
Hmm.

57:44.595 --> 57:46.795
Didn't know we sold these.

57:51.968 --> 57:52.901
Milk.

57:52.903 --> 57:56.572
That's a weird word if
you say it enough times.

57:56.574 --> 57:57.506
Milk.

58:00.910 --> 58:03.178
Boy I never seen them
all connected like that,

58:03.180 --> 58:04.646
that's weird.

58:06.050 --> 58:10.118
Hey Jeff, can we get a price
check on these tomatoes?

58:10.120 --> 58:11.553
There's five of them.

58:11.555 --> 58:14.056
- You know, I don't
want the tomatoes.

58:14.058 --> 58:15.491
- You sure?
- Mm hmm.

58:15.493 --> 58:16.625
- They're in season,
these are good too.

58:16.627 --> 58:18.060
That's cool but I'm good.

58:18.062 --> 58:21.497
Actually, could you
move a little faster?

58:21.499 --> 58:23.165
I'm sorry, I'm just in a hurry.

58:23.167 --> 58:25.200
And you're really
taking your time.

58:26.070 --> 58:26.935
Hey.

58:26.937 --> 58:31.206
My sister's just feeling a
little bit overheated, you know.

58:31.208 --> 58:35.210
She doesn't understand the
stress that a cashier is under.

58:35.212 --> 58:37.513
Why don't you go get
yourself a little gumball?

58:37.515 --> 58:40.916
There's so many, they're so
pretty, so many varieties.

58:40.918 --> 58:41.984
Come on.

58:41.986 --> 58:47.256
Yes the amount of pressure
that cashiers face every day,

58:47.258 --> 58:49.191
all day, unrecognized.

58:50.627 --> 58:52.127
I'm a sales associate.

58:52.129 --> 58:54.129
Sales, right, of course.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.098
I'm so sorry, sales associate.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.032
Yes.

58:58.268 --> 58:59.601
What was your name?

58:59.603 --> 59:00.602
I'm Ford.

59:01.538 --> 59:02.771
Like the car.

59:02.773 --> 59:04.706
Oh that is a cool name.

59:04.708 --> 59:08.911
Well I'm Emma and that's...

59:09.712 --> 59:11.713
That's Mildred.

59:11.715 --> 59:13.649
Having a bit of a day.

59:17.787 --> 59:19.254
Oh there it is.

59:19.256 --> 59:21.123
I watch a lot of
food TV you know,

59:21.125 --> 59:23.292
like cooking challenge
shows, recipe shows,

59:23.294 --> 59:25.861
chef personality shows.

59:25.863 --> 59:27.596
My friend Remy once
told me about a show

59:27.598 --> 59:30.098
where they made chefs
fight at the end.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.733
I was like Remy
that can't be real,

59:31.735 --> 59:33.602
he's like it is.

59:33.604 --> 59:35.103
I'm like alright, 'cause
I'll believe anything,

59:35.105 --> 59:37.940
but I wouldn't doubt it.

59:37.942 --> 59:39.241
- Cool.
- Yeah.

59:39.243 --> 59:40.809
That's really cool.

59:40.811 --> 59:42.110
- Anyway I also got a
crazy memory for recipes.

59:42.112 --> 59:45.280
I just retain 'em and
I can just spout off

59:45.282 --> 59:49.151
like 100 recipes right off the
top of my head, it's weird.

59:49.153 --> 59:50.352
- Well I would
love to hear that.

59:50.354 --> 59:53.188
- Yeah there's this
one pasta pesto dish

59:53.190 --> 59:54.723
I been dying to make.

59:54.725 --> 59:56.892
I can give you the
recipe if you want it.

59:56.894 --> 59:57.893
Would you?

59:57.895 --> 59:59.361
Thank you so much.

01:00:01.297 --> 01:00:02.898
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:05.934
You wanna pass me that bag
and I'll start bagging?

01:00:05.936 --> 01:00:07.603
Oh thanks Mills.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:11.807
- Yeah just you know do
something to get us outta here.

01:00:11.809 --> 01:00:15.043
- I'll write this up
for you right now, miss.

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:16.211
Pesto.

01:00:16.213 --> 01:00:17.646
- I don't even know
what is in pesto.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:18.780
- So you just get it
premade, you just...

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.382
- Yeah they have
like jars of it.

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:21.850
So pesto, pasta.

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:22.918
Big water.

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.623
- Five salts.
- Yep.

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:28.924
So is that?

01:00:28.926 --> 01:00:32.127
You know what, yeah,
that sounds good.

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.864
- What the hell?
- Oh my god!

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.233
Sue me for having like one
person to send a text to.

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.101
Albert is not turning on.

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:15.203
Well did you stall him?

01:01:16.305 --> 01:01:17.239
Would you like to try?

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:19.708
I would love to actually.

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:37.759
What can I say?

01:01:37.761 --> 01:01:39.294
He has bad days.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:41.897
He's been doing
really good so far.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.833
We've gotten this
far, haven't we?

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.768
I cannot believe you.

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.037
- How can this
possibly be my fault?

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:51.373
I have a shitty car, sue me.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:58.246
- You know you always manage
to make every day worse.

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:03.785
- Yeah well you've been
a real beam of sunshine.

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:05.787
I cannot believe you.

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:07.989
Me?

01:02:07.991 --> 01:02:09.391
Really?

01:02:09.393 --> 01:02:12.027
Aren't you supposed to
be the responsible one?

01:02:12.029 --> 01:02:15.063
No I mean like isn't that
what you tell yourself?

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.965
You're the one driving
now, aren't you?

01:02:16.967 --> 01:02:21.770
- I have always taken care
of you and you know that.

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:23.305
You've taken care of me.

01:02:23.307 --> 01:02:24.906
Really?
- Yeah.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:25.307
- No really, you think that
that's what's been happening?

01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:26.908
Yes!

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:28.777
- You know what I take it
back, I don't like you.

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:29.911
Good, I don't like you either.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.313
Great.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:32.280
So there is a reason that
this hasn't been happening.

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:33.749
- Absolutely.
- Awesome.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.021
You like it, don't you?

01:02:40.023 --> 01:02:41.757
The way men just fall
over themselves for you.

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:42.991
- Oh come on!
- No you need to understand

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:46.161
something Emma, the
way that you come off.

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:48.363
Yeah, how do I come off?

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:49.297
Slutty.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.800
Really?

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:55.237
Really you're gonna
slut shame me now?

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:56.905
Well you know what Millie?

01:02:56.907 --> 01:02:59.074
I think that you could use a
little slutty in your life.

01:02:59.076 --> 01:03:00.976
Yeah no then maybe you
wouldn't be so afraid about

01:03:00.978 --> 01:03:04.045
having sex you unlovable,
self-absorbed bitch!

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.421
Come on, it's too hot.

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:45.914
Did any mail come for me?

01:04:45.916 --> 01:04:46.915
Oh so are we talking now?

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.583
Is that what we're doing?

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:50.085
Come on.

01:04:50.087 --> 01:04:51.353
No.

01:04:51.355 --> 01:04:52.287
Why?

01:04:53.322 --> 01:04:56.358
- I'm waiting on
that letter from DC.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.260
We just got here Millie.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:00.962
That's not really
how mail works.

01:05:00.964 --> 01:05:02.030
Why don't you just
wait til tomorrow

01:05:02.032 --> 01:05:03.899
and check it when we get home?

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:06.001
What do you mean?

01:05:06.003 --> 01:05:07.602
Aren't we leaving?

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.437
I can't.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:13.541
No that's way too much for me.

01:05:13.543 --> 01:05:14.476
Mom.

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.480
Dad's face.

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:23.151
I don't want a sad mix tape.

01:05:23.153 --> 01:05:25.921
I just need some privacy.

01:05:25.923 --> 01:05:28.657
Okay well that I can do.

01:05:28.659 --> 01:05:29.591
Emma.

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:48.710
Emma, let's go downstairs.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:51.179
There's no TV downstairs.

01:05:53.649 --> 01:05:55.083
You planned this, didn't you?

01:05:55.085 --> 01:05:56.318
Yep.

01:06:00.523 --> 01:06:01.423
Yes.

01:07:19.735 --> 01:07:21.669
How does Grandma have
a Darlingside album?

01:07:21.671 --> 01:07:23.471
I have no idea.

01:07:23.473 --> 01:07:27.275
She's got style though,
gotta give her that.

01:08:15.759 --> 01:08:17.091
Emma Haven.

01:08:18.661 --> 01:08:20.194
You really are something.

01:09:26.428 --> 01:09:28.595
Emma.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:29.596
What?

01:09:29.599 --> 01:09:30.598
Get up, get up.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.469
- No, we gotta go upstairs
before we fall asleep down here.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:35.870
What?

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:36.904
No this is good.

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:37.839
I'm cozy.

01:09:39.608 --> 01:09:42.277
- My head hurts.
- Such a wuss.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.715
Why would you do that to me?

01:10:11.473 --> 01:10:14.342
I'll show you who a wuss is.

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:16.811
That really wasn't that tough.

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:55.316
- Oh whoa whoa whoa...
- Oh god!

01:10:55.318 --> 01:10:56.317
Whoa, are you okay?

01:10:56.319 --> 01:10:57.318
Yeah, I...

01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.553
Hey!

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:01.456
Just stay back,
don't come close.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:02.457
Okay yeah no I surrender.

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:03.591
Please, don't cook me.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.431
You should probably stay inside.

01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:13.334
Tornado watch is in order
for another hour or so.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:17.839
- Oh watch, smatch, I only
go inside for warnings.

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:18.973
Oh I see.

01:11:18.975 --> 01:11:19.974
A true midwesterner.

01:11:19.976 --> 01:11:21.542
Yeah.

01:11:21.544 --> 01:11:23.578
We would sit on our porch
and watch 'em go by.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:24.712
Cool, yeah.

01:11:26.582 --> 01:11:27.749
I'm Blake.

01:11:27.751 --> 01:11:28.683
Millie.

01:11:29.818 --> 01:11:32.053
This is my grandma's house.

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:35.423
- Oh Mildred's your grandma.
- Mm hmm.

01:11:35.425 --> 01:11:36.824
Cool, cool.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:40.928
I'm staying with my uncle
for the summer, Rodney.

01:11:42.364 --> 01:11:44.632
Yeah well, he pretty much
just keeps to himself.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.467
Mildred asked me to keep
an eye on the animals

01:11:46.469 --> 01:11:48.036
and then he asked me to
come over and make sure

01:11:48.038 --> 01:11:50.471
they didn't get too spooked
here with the weather.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.873
Of course.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:55.009
- She was going down to her
granddaughter's wedding?

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.444
Were you there?

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:58.313
Yeah.

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:00.548
It was lovely.

01:12:01.617 --> 01:12:02.550
Nice.

01:12:03.519 --> 01:12:06.054
Uh... so what's with the weapon?

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.759
I was making eggs.

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:14.829
Uh huh.

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.499
I'm sorry if I scared you.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:20.702
No, you didn't scare me.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.572
I was just weird.

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:32.447
Stay still.

01:12:32.449 --> 01:12:34.015
Ow!

01:12:34.017 --> 01:12:36.351
Ah, just saved your life.

01:12:36.353 --> 01:12:38.086
Thanks for that.

01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:40.388
I like it out here.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:44.592
It's good when you need a place
to be alone and just think.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.962
Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:55.570
- I'm gonna go check on the
chickens if you wanna come.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:59.407
- Oh that's exactly
where I was headed.

01:12:59.409 --> 01:13:02.810
Sure, just you know,
don't get too close.

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.888
Looks like the chickens
are still here.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.824
Yeah, looks like it.

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:23.564
You wanna do a lap
around the silo?

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:25.767
Yeah.

01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.034
That's a great idea.

01:13:27.036 --> 01:13:28.503
Love that idea.

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.439
- So you're
just visiting?

01:13:31.441 --> 01:13:32.507
Yeah.

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:33.708
Bummer.

01:13:33.710 --> 01:13:35.076
I just mean there aren't
a whole lot of people

01:13:35.078 --> 01:13:37.779
to hang out with here in Marcy.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.615
Can I ask you something?

01:13:40.617 --> 01:13:41.549
Sure.

01:13:42.951 --> 01:13:45.653
Do you wanna get married?

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:49.590
- Wow Millie I'm
flattered but we just met.

01:13:49.592 --> 01:13:51.459
No, no not with me.

01:13:52.594 --> 01:13:55.696
God I just meant like in life.

01:13:55.698 --> 01:13:57.799
I dunno, maybe someday.

01:13:59.134 --> 01:14:00.802
- Yeah I really thought
I was gonna get married

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:02.437
but now I'm not so sure.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:04.839
I just keep thinking about
all the things I wanna do,

01:14:04.841 --> 01:14:06.474
you know?

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:08.009
Well.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:11.946
I think whoever you marry
should help you do those things,

01:14:11.948 --> 01:14:14.549
not keep you from doing them.

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.987
Yeah, I totally agree.

01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:32.500
Ow!

01:14:32.502 --> 01:14:33.501
Wow.
- Got him.

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:34.936
Two in a night.

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.674
Look at that, that is fantastic.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:43.144
So maybe I'll see you around.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:47.915
- Yeah I mean... I
would... maybe tomorrow.

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.653
- I just meant maybe
I'll see you around.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:54.222
Kinda have a girlfriend.

01:14:54.224 --> 01:14:56.958
I mean we haven't really talked
about it so I don't really

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:59.660
know for sure but
she's just so great.

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.728
Of course.

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:03.197
You'd really like her.

01:15:03.199 --> 01:15:05.266
You actually kinda
remind me of her.

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:06.200
Ah!

01:15:09.104 --> 01:15:10.705
- Alright.
- Okay.

01:15:13.542 --> 01:15:15.676
Yep, both going this way.

01:15:27.222 --> 01:15:28.155
Hey.

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:35.997
Good news, the power's back
on so that means coffee, woo.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:41.302
Do you want any
breakfast, eggs, bread?

01:15:48.710 --> 01:15:51.245
How do you want me
to cook your eggs?

01:15:51.247 --> 01:15:52.179
Fried?

01:15:55.851 --> 01:15:58.753
- You want me to
poach your eggs?

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:01.789
Scrambled?

01:16:01.791 --> 01:16:04.792
- There we go,
that's more like it.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.630
Oh my god, eggs.

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:12.833
That's a far cry from how
we used to eat here as kids.

01:16:12.835 --> 01:16:15.570
What's the name of that
cereal we used to eat.

01:16:15.572 --> 01:16:16.871
Ooh, chocolate puffs.

01:16:16.873 --> 01:16:18.873
- I thought I was
chocolate crisps.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:20.141
Nuh uh.

01:16:20.143 --> 01:16:22.743
Coco Nuggets, you ingrates.

01:16:22.745 --> 01:16:24.612
- Grandma!
- Hi Grandma!

01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:29.016
- What in tarnation are
you doing at my house?

01:16:29.018 --> 01:16:30.184
You didn't tell her?

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:31.352
- I...
- No.

01:16:31.354 --> 01:16:34.155
No she did not, nobody
tells me anything.

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:35.923
Oh Grandma I'm so so sorry.

01:16:35.925 --> 01:16:36.857
Mm hmm.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:41.762
You know Millie, you've
caused a lot of trouble.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:44.265
But this is some next level BS.

01:16:45.734 --> 01:16:47.268
I thought you knew.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:51.038
- Would I let you wallow
in self-pity alone?

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.840
Absolutely not.

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:55.643
I was cleaning up
the mess you made.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:58.980
Little did I think I'd
return to more mess.

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:01.616
- I'm sorry, let me
help you with that.

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:03.384
Oh!

01:17:04.286 --> 01:17:05.319
Waffle iron.

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:07.355
Ba ba ba ba ba!

01:17:07.357 --> 01:17:09.690
We're going to
write apology notes

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:12.193
and return every
single one of those

01:17:12.195 --> 01:17:14.695
so don't get any big ideas.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.265
Wait are all of these for me?

01:17:18.267 --> 01:17:20.801
- Yes, they're all
for you goofleberry

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:23.070
and the cake is in the car.

01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:26.641
You mean the groom's cake.

01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:28.342
It's the least you can do.

01:17:28.344 --> 01:17:30.177
- Well Grandma please
just throw it out,

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.179
it's gotta be stale.

01:17:32.181 --> 01:17:34.081
I'm not above it.

01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:36.283
Never waste a good cake.

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.220
She gets it.

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:46.093
Grandma, why didn't you just
mail these from Kansas City?

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.396
It's gonna cost a
fortune from here.

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:50.264
Don't you worry.

01:17:50.266 --> 01:17:51.265
Go on, get.

01:18:01.143 --> 01:18:02.710
- Ow!
- Ow!

01:18:02.712 --> 01:18:03.844
God look where you're going.

01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:05.279
Get in the car.

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:07.948
- God I cannot believe that
you didn't tell Grandma.

01:18:07.950 --> 01:18:10.084
- This is exactly my
problem with you Emma.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.252
You're a pathological liar.

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.120
Oh my god, no I'm not!

01:18:13.122 --> 01:18:15.056
Please don't yell at me.

01:18:15.058 --> 01:18:17.925
- You're the one
whisper yelling!

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:27.735
What have I done now?

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:29.203
You upset Grandma!

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:30.204
She seems fine.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.205
It's kinda fun having her here.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.206
Fun?

01:18:32.208 --> 01:18:36.310
Oh yeah great, splendiferous.
- Splendiferous, really.

01:18:36.312 --> 01:18:37.478
Yeah, look it up.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.879
- You're just
gonna walk away?

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:40.047
What?

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:41.015
I have a date with
the hand number guy.

01:18:41.017 --> 01:18:41.749
A date, seriously?

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:44.085
You're leaving?
- Who is it?

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:45.453
I'll be back.

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:47.154
- Whatever you're selling
we've already got it.

01:18:47.156 --> 01:18:48.355
It's for me.

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.292
- Well you can't be
too careful these days.

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:55.496
I've got a walk in closet full
of Wilderness Girl cookies.

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:00.768
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:01.769
Thank you.

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:02.770
Wow I was just here.

01:19:02.772 --> 01:19:04.138
Grandma, this is Blake.

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:05.740
- Mildred,
yeah we go way back.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:07.908
- Well hi, nice
to see you again.

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:09.910
Thanks for watching my place.

01:19:09.912 --> 01:19:11.078
Oh my pleasure.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:13.447
- Can I offer you a
glass of iced tea?

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:14.815
Cake?

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.951
- Oh no no no, we
have tickets, right?

01:19:16.953 --> 01:19:18.052
So we should probably go?
- Yeah we probably

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.186
should get going.
- Yeah.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:20.121
Sorry.

01:19:22.290 --> 01:19:25.826
- Blake this
is my sister Millie.

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:27.862
Hey Blake.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:31.532
It is so nice to meet you, wow.

01:19:31.534 --> 01:19:34.268
You take good care of this one
'cause she's my little sister

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.503
and you know what
don't stay out too late

01:19:35.505 --> 01:19:37.138
'cause we have dinner plans.

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:38.072
Huh.

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.141
No worries.

01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:45.079
It was a pleasure to
meet you as well, Millie.

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:46.347
Yeah.

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:47.281
Okay.

01:19:48.784 --> 01:19:52.486
Now that we've all met and,
you know, shaken hands,

01:19:52.488 --> 01:19:56.223
been sufficiently awkward,
I think that we can go.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:57.958
Right?
- Yeah.

01:20:00.062 --> 01:20:01.562
Nice seeing you.

01:20:01.564 --> 01:20:03.397
You have fun!

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:05.533
So much fun, all the fun.

01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:09.503
What?

01:20:10.372 --> 01:20:12.039
Everything's cool.

01:20:13.842 --> 01:20:17.011
- Isn't he a cool
drink of water?

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:20.347
- Yep, Emma always
catches that worm.

01:20:20.349 --> 01:20:22.950
Oh the hot ones go to Emma.

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:27.521
- I want some tea,
do you want some tea?

01:20:27.523 --> 01:20:30.257
Oh yeah I'd love some tea.

01:20:30.259 --> 01:20:31.826
And cake.

01:20:31.828 --> 01:20:33.294
Ooh, you got it.

01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:40.601
Don't get up, I
got it, I got it.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.105
What'd you guys leave something?

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:56.617
What do I do?

01:20:56.619 --> 01:20:58.152
Open the door.

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.254
Okay.

01:21:07.596 --> 01:21:08.529
Hey.

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:11.498
Hi.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.636
What are you doing here?

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:21.108
- I just really
wanted to talk to you.

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:22.543
Brought your mail.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:23.477
Oh.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.915
- You know I have to
do my childs poses.

01:21:27.917 --> 01:21:32.119
If you don't mind, could
you move this to the porch?

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.430
You okay?

01:21:43.432 --> 01:21:45.132
I've been better.

01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.201
Yeah me too.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.640
Mills, hey.

01:21:54.309 --> 01:21:58.512
You know I've had a lot of
time to think about this

01:22:00.615 --> 01:22:02.950
and I got a lot to say.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.285
Is that alright?

01:22:08.556 --> 01:22:09.556
I love you.

01:22:11.192 --> 01:22:13.627
I love you so much and
I've loved you for so long

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:17.097
and so deeply, so purely
and I've spent eight

01:22:17.099 --> 01:22:19.466
incredible years with you.

01:22:19.468 --> 01:22:20.401
I know.

01:22:22.037 --> 01:22:26.040
- So can we just get out
of here please, together?

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:29.376
I'm here to win you
back, Mildred Haven.

01:22:31.579 --> 01:22:33.047
Oh Charlie.

01:22:33.049 --> 01:22:36.116
- I love you and I
accept you, all of you.

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:40.321
If you apologize I'll take
you back in an instant.

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:44.058
An apology?

01:22:45.627 --> 01:22:48.662
- I've just been feeling
terrible, I'm sure you have too.

01:22:48.664 --> 01:22:51.565
We just gotta come
back together.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:02.209
- I don't wanna be
with you, Charlie.

01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:07.414
You don't mean that.

01:23:07.416 --> 01:23:08.582
You don't mean
that baby, come on.

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:10.451
What about our plan?

01:23:10.453 --> 01:23:11.385
The plan?

01:23:12.754 --> 01:23:14.355
The yellow house.

01:23:15.357 --> 01:23:18.759
- That's not me anymore,
I don't want that.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.730
- Babe, come on,
of course you do.

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:27.134
It's what we've talked
about, babe that's the dream.

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:30.637
I don't want the yellow house.

01:23:33.708 --> 01:23:37.778
I want arguments, I want
big cities and trouble.

01:23:38.713 --> 01:23:41.181
Okay you can have both.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:43.183
I can give you both.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:47.321
- Oh god I knew you were
gonna say that, Charlie.

01:23:47.323 --> 01:23:51.358
Charlie you are the
kindest man that I know,

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.063
and it makes me feel guilty
that I'm not more kind

01:23:56.065 --> 01:23:57.664
or sweet or perfect.

01:24:00.635 --> 01:24:02.436
- But you are perfect,
you're perfect for me.

01:24:02.438 --> 01:24:05.372
- No, no I'm not, I'm
not, and I know that

01:24:05.374 --> 01:24:09.576
and I'm okay with that,
I'm... I'm figuring that out.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:16.150
- Can you just come
home with me please?

01:24:16.152 --> 01:24:19.686
Can we just go home and we
can figure this out together?

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:20.621
Charlie.

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.123
I'm so sorry.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.294
I'm so sorry that I hurt you.

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.197
I just can't.

01:24:37.238 --> 01:24:39.406
Is this because of Emma?

01:24:39.408 --> 01:24:43.610
'Cause this doesn't sound like
you, this sounds like her.

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:48.382
I knew it.

01:24:48.384 --> 01:24:51.185
I knew it as soon
as you two took off.

01:24:51.187 --> 01:24:52.653
Can we just talk about this?
- Don't touch me!

01:24:52.655 --> 01:24:54.121
Don't touch me!

01:24:57.659 --> 01:25:00.394
Oh my god it doesn't matter.

01:25:00.396 --> 01:25:02.729
You know what it
doesn't matter because

01:25:02.731 --> 01:25:06.733
the last few days without
you have been happier

01:25:08.736 --> 01:25:11.672
than I can ever
remember feeling.

01:25:11.674 --> 01:25:14.875
And do you know what
that freedom feels like?

01:25:14.877 --> 01:25:16.743
It feels like summer.

01:25:19.681 --> 01:25:22.149
It feels like all the
things that I didn't think

01:25:22.151 --> 01:25:23.884
I was allowed to feel.

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:30.224
I was just doing what I
thought I was supposed to do

01:25:31.292 --> 01:25:34.595
but that is not the
same as loving someone.

01:26:50.972 --> 01:26:53.507
Dropped your weapon.

01:26:53.509 --> 01:26:55.509
Thank you Blake.

01:26:55.511 --> 01:26:57.978
Nice to see you Millie.

01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:00.314
I'm gonna talk to
you soon, okay?

01:27:00.316 --> 01:27:02.382
- Great yeah.
- Okay yeah.

01:27:08.289 --> 01:27:10.591
You're looking real good.

01:27:15.863 --> 01:27:16.797
So.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:19.333
You met Blake.

01:27:21.236 --> 01:27:22.569
Sure did, yep.

01:27:24.672 --> 01:27:25.606
And?

01:27:26.874 --> 01:27:28.575
- Probably a little
too muscular for me.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:29.943
Sure.

01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:32.746
But you know, to each his own.

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.415
What?

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.451
- I dunno, just you know the
next time that you ask out

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:40.520
my man friend could you
please just tell me about it?

01:27:40.522 --> 01:27:42.623
If you could communicate
that to me with words

01:27:42.625 --> 01:27:44.925
that would just be helpful.

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:46.426
- I talked to Charlie.
- No!

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.295
Don't change the subject.

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:51.832
He's actually really
important to me.

01:27:51.834 --> 01:27:52.899
Oh, sorry.

01:27:55.003 --> 01:27:56.703
- But I mean, how many
hot guys did you think

01:27:56.705 --> 01:27:58.572
there were in Marcy?

01:27:58.574 --> 01:27:59.906
Everyone's so geriatric.

01:27:59.908 --> 01:28:01.375
- You know when you
put it like that.

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:02.776
- Right?
- Mm hmm.

01:28:04.812 --> 01:28:06.513
So.

01:28:06.515 --> 01:28:07.514
You called Charlie.

01:28:07.516 --> 01:28:09.583
Mm, nn nn, he came here.

01:28:09.585 --> 01:28:10.851
What?

01:28:10.853 --> 01:28:12.486
Way to bury the lede!

01:28:12.488 --> 01:28:13.854
He was here.
- Yeah.

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:15.656
Where is he now?

01:28:15.658 --> 01:28:17.357
He's gone.

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:18.425
He's gone?

01:28:20.962 --> 01:28:22.029
He's gone.

01:28:22.864 --> 01:28:23.797
Gone gone.

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:26.900
Well good for you.

01:28:29.837 --> 01:28:30.904
Girl gang.

01:28:30.906 --> 01:28:32.673
- Girl gang.
- Boop.

01:28:38.012 --> 01:28:39.313
- Emma?
- Hmm?

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:43.350
- Hey chickadees, what's
all that squawking about?

01:28:44.353 --> 01:28:45.752
Nothing.

01:28:47.922 --> 01:28:52.326
- You know you girls are so
lucky to have each other.

01:28:54.762 --> 01:28:57.998
Growing up with four
brothers is hard.

01:28:59.534 --> 01:29:03.704
I do love 'em, but oh my
sweet lord, they were a pain.

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:08.775
All I ever wanted was
a good girl friend.

01:29:08.777 --> 01:29:12.846
And I tried, but... I was
sharp around the edges.

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:18.552
I look at you two and I
think how great it must be

01:29:18.554 --> 01:29:21.555
to have someone
that just gets you.

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:24.424
Sisters are special.

01:29:24.426 --> 01:29:27.494
You have someone to
be different with.

01:29:27.496 --> 01:29:30.964
Now, whatever is going
on between you two,

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:37.437
you need to let it
out, let it all out.

01:29:37.439 --> 01:29:40.941
Howl at the moon,
and then let it go.

01:29:40.943 --> 01:29:44.644
Because there will never
be someone as important

01:29:44.646 --> 01:29:47.848
as the one standing
right next to you.

01:29:49.751 --> 01:29:52.619
So get off your
darn high horses.

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:55.622
You know what to do.

01:29:59.861 --> 01:30:00.927
I'm sorry.

01:30:02.430 --> 01:30:03.163
Me too.

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:07.868
That was good.

01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:10.570
You know Emma, ever
since you were a baby

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.639
you knew exactly
what you wanted.

01:30:12.641 --> 01:30:15.742
Now one day you decided
that I was your favorite.

01:30:15.744 --> 01:30:17.744
Well I felt so special.

01:30:18.980 --> 01:30:22.749
I was the only one that
could make you stop crying.

01:30:22.751 --> 01:30:25.719
And then the next day
it'd be someone else.

01:30:25.721 --> 01:30:26.653
Huh.

01:30:27.922 --> 01:30:32.058
- But the only one that
could always make you laugh

01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.195
whether they cared
about it or not...

01:30:36.464 --> 01:30:38.498
Wait, really?

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:41.902
- You two are very
important to each other.

01:30:41.904 --> 01:30:46.106
I think it's time you stopped
being such boneheads about it.

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.010
- Grandma what was
I like as a baby?

01:30:50.012 --> 01:30:50.877
Fussy.

01:30:54.081 --> 01:30:56.817
You sure were darn cute though.

01:30:57.919 --> 01:30:59.019
You were cute.

01:30:59.021 --> 01:31:00.220
Mm hmm, I heard that.

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:03.156
- Yeah, not present
tense, past tense.

01:31:12.533 --> 01:31:13.633
Hey Mills?

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:15.068
Yeah.

01:31:15.070 --> 01:31:18.138
Think I need to talk to you.

01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:20.774
I don't wanna go.
- What?

01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:23.777
No no, I was gonna say I
kind of want to go alone.

01:31:23.779 --> 01:31:26.646
- Oh I wanna stay
here for the summer.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:30.517
I wanna stay and see
what happens with Blake.

01:31:30.519 --> 01:31:32.219
It needs to be whatever
it wants to be.

01:31:32.221 --> 01:31:35.522
- Emma Haven look at you,
jumping off the deep end!

01:31:35.524 --> 01:31:36.923
- Is that okay?
- Yes!

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:38.959
You finally found a good
one, I am so proud of you.

01:31:38.961 --> 01:31:40.126
Ugh.

01:31:40.128 --> 01:31:41.528
- No this'll be good,
this will be good.

01:31:41.530 --> 01:31:42.929
I'll swing by home
for damage control,

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:45.799
and then I'll do
the drive to DC.

01:31:46.934 --> 01:31:48.535
What?

01:31:48.537 --> 01:31:50.070
What if you don't get in?

01:31:50.072 --> 01:31:51.505
I'll just figure it out.

01:31:51.507 --> 01:31:54.608
- Millie Haven and
not having a plan!

01:31:54.610 --> 01:31:57.677
Well I learned from the best.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:31:59.112
- Oh that's true!
- That's you.

01:32:03.084 --> 01:32:05.819
- Guess I can't use
these, but, you know what?

01:32:05.821 --> 01:32:07.687
I think he likes you.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:08.889
- Me?
- Mm hmm.

01:32:49.931 --> 01:32:52.799
Albert you're my number five.

01:32:52.801 --> 01:32:54.167
Hey.

01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:55.168
You forgot these.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:28.268
Hit the dashboard,
just whack it!

01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:30.637
Turn on the wipers,
hit the dashboard.

01:33:30.639 --> 01:33:31.304
Got it!

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:32.238
Woo!
