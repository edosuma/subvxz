00:17.222 --> 00:19.350
El Gato!

00:36.660 --> 00:39.902
<b>4x12 - The Obelisk</b>

01:14.988 --> 01:17.074
Hello?

01:30.671 --> 01:32.464
Hello?

01:36.343 --> 01:37.636
Hello?

01:46.895 --> 01:48.063
Oh!

02:00.451 --> 02:01.410
Oh!

02:35.068 --> 02:37.321
No. I said easy-peasy, over easy.

02:38.697 --> 02:40.491
This is over easy.

02:41.116 --> 02:42.743
Also, what's over easy?

02:44.161 --> 02:45.746
Hmm.

02:45.829 --> 02:48.248
- Wakey, wakey, eggs and ba...
- Oh!

02:48.332 --> 02:52.336
Artephius! Oh, I'm so sorry!
I thought you were me!

02:53.712 --> 02:55.297
That's okay, Dulcey!

02:55.380 --> 02:59.009
I think I'm me sometimes too!
Ooh, spooky stuff!

02:59.510 --> 03:01.720
To think, after all this time,

03:01.803 --> 03:04.973
the obelisk was right under our nose,
in San Lorenzo.

03:06.266 --> 03:08.894
Yeah! And when you find it you'll, uh...

03:08.977 --> 03:10.312
What'll you do, again?

03:10.395 --> 03:14.274
Well, obviously,
I will don the Crown of Souls.

03:14.358 --> 03:17.861
And then I will utilize the obelisk
to defeat the Bloodwolf.

03:18.654 --> 03:19.863
In some way.

03:19.947 --> 03:23.283
So, in other words,
we don't know what the obelisk does?

03:23.367 --> 03:24.368
Um...

03:24.576 --> 03:25.452
Look!

03:28.997 --> 03:31.250
What is the meaning
of this solar villainy?

03:31.833 --> 03:33.752
Oh, it's nothing to worry about, Puss.

03:33.835 --> 03:36.505
It's just that the sun
turns red on Walpurgisnacht

03:36.588 --> 03:39.424
when the Bloodwolf is returning
to destroy the world!

03:39.508 --> 03:42.469
It's so pretty!

03:42.678 --> 03:44.096
Come, my friends.

03:44.179 --> 03:47.641
San Lorenzo and our fates await. Ha-ha!

03:55.399 --> 03:59.528
Oh, San Lorenzans!
We have returned, triumphant!

04:03.240 --> 04:06.368
Something's not right. Where is everybody?

04:07.995 --> 04:09.705
We know where the obelisk is!

04:09.788 --> 04:13.208
It is right here in San Lorenzo!

04:13.792 --> 04:15.210
Puss in the boots!

04:16.336 --> 04:20.507
It's pronounced "El Mocoville."

04:30.100 --> 04:32.769
El Moco,
what have you done with our friends?

04:33.353 --> 04:34.730
Bring out the prisoners.

04:42.571 --> 04:45.073
Herr Boots. I tried to stop them,

04:45.157 --> 04:47.826
but they were too powerful
for mein goaty dancing.

04:53.999 --> 04:55.751
Hey.

04:55.834 --> 04:59.338
How could this have happened?
Collectively, you are a fighting marvel!

04:59.921 --> 05:03.175
What can I say,
they, like, overwhelmed us, or whatever.

05:03.258 --> 05:06.345
Yes, he's got my old magic armor.

05:06.928 --> 05:09.348
Let me tell you how I found it.

05:10.849 --> 05:13.393
I came upon it
while weeping in the desert.

05:18.523 --> 05:20.984
At first, I thought it was a fancy house.

05:22.319 --> 05:23.445
So, I climbed in.

05:24.571 --> 05:25.864
But as soon as I did,

05:25.947 --> 05:28.617
this crazy, metal death machine
came to life.

05:33.747 --> 05:34.915
I knew in that moment

05:34.998 --> 05:39.378
that I would finally have my revenge
on the gato who ruined my life.

05:41.713 --> 05:45.217
While I love nothing more than battling
with you, this is not a good time!

05:45.300 --> 05:48.178
It is never a good time to die, kitty...

05:49.179 --> 05:50.555
but die you will.

06:03.777 --> 06:04.694
Huh?

06:07.698 --> 06:11.493
No, I mean, it is really not a good time.
Today is Walpurgisnacht!

06:11.576 --> 06:13.245
That is not a thing.

06:14.621 --> 06:16.540
Ha!

06:18.208 --> 06:19.126
Whoa!

06:20.001 --> 06:22.295
El Moco, we have to locate an obelisk

06:22.379 --> 06:24.923
so that we may stop the Bloodwolf
from returning to Earth!

06:25.006 --> 06:28.343
I don't care. It is time to die.

06:28.927 --> 06:29.970
No, wait, wait!

06:40.063 --> 06:41.022
Puss!

06:49.489 --> 06:51.241
Good heavens, man!

06:51.324 --> 06:53.076
Are you all right?

06:53.702 --> 06:54.536
What?

06:55.328 --> 06:56.955
Are you all right?

06:57.038 --> 06:59.040
Yes! I am in a fight!

07:01.126 --> 07:02.627
Now, come, my glassy friend.

07:02.711 --> 07:05.797
Whatever magic spell you possess,
I need it.

07:10.051 --> 07:11.261
El Moco!

07:13.722 --> 07:17.934
Well, well. Have you brought me
a little present to win my mercy?

07:19.269 --> 07:20.187
Come again?

07:21.104 --> 07:23.732
I think my ears are damaged
from before when you struck me.

07:24.274 --> 07:25.776
I said...

07:25.859 --> 07:28.403
..."Is that a gift for me?"

07:29.362 --> 07:31.990
You are mumbling.
Oh, forget it.

07:37.954 --> 07:39.080
Puss!

07:42.501 --> 07:46.963
No! What have you done?
We needed him. He was the One.

07:47.631 --> 07:50.634
Your goaty lies are grinding my gears.

07:52.093 --> 07:53.261
Gears?

07:53.470 --> 07:54.679
Gears.

08:06.233 --> 08:08.068
Ow.

08:10.362 --> 08:14.908
Puss! Be careful.
The spell will wear off quickly.

08:14.991 --> 08:15.909
What?

08:15.992 --> 08:20.455
I said, "Be careful.
The spell will wear off quickly."

08:20.539 --> 08:22.332
I did not hear you, but do not worry.

08:22.415 --> 08:23.917
This cannot possibly go wrong.

08:25.669 --> 08:26.545
Ow!

08:33.009 --> 08:36.011
All right, El Moco.
Let us end this.

08:36.096 --> 08:37.681
Gasp!

08:44.062 --> 08:45.272
My sword!

09:24.728 --> 09:25.687
Hmm?

09:32.694 --> 09:34.446
Ha! Success.

09:35.655 --> 09:37.824
The spell. It is wearing off.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.910
Why did no one warn me?

09:39.993 --> 09:41.494
Why won't you work?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.247
Uli! Are you okay?

09:53.965 --> 09:55.717
El Moco's gone loco.

10:27.248 --> 10:29.459
Now that is how you defeat a villain.

10:30.502 --> 10:31.878
Puss!

10:33.797 --> 10:35.715
Herr Boots, you are alive.

10:35.799 --> 10:38.593
Thanks to you, my friend.

10:42.097 --> 10:43.139
Puss, the sun!

10:46.768 --> 10:48.812
We must make haste, Herr Boots.

10:56.611 --> 11:01.032
Okay, everyone, we are short on time.
I have learned that the Obelisk of Night

11:01.116 --> 11:05.203
is hidden somewhere right here,
in San Lorenzo. Search the town!

11:05.495 --> 11:08.081
Did you guys check the treasure house?

11:08.164 --> 11:11.251
I only mention it because I can
detect and differentiate

11:11.334 --> 11:15.171
between all the different kinds
of magical energy and stuff.

11:19.426 --> 11:21.553
Why did you not
mention this before?

11:21.636 --> 11:22.637
Ooh, didn't I?

11:22.721 --> 11:23.555
You did not.

11:48.455 --> 11:53.543
Ooh, I'm getting a very
strong signal right over...

11:54.794 --> 11:55.754
here.

11:59.132 --> 12:00.133
A dead end?

12:00.717 --> 12:02.844
Oh, very helpful, Duchess!

12:02.927 --> 12:05.096
Why, look! We have found the obelisk!

12:05.597 --> 12:08.850
Yes, here it is,
the answer to all of our problems!

12:08.933 --> 12:13.188
What a helpful and useful human person
you are for helping us find the obelisk!

12:13.271 --> 12:14.314
Whee!

12:14.397 --> 12:17.609
- We did it! Now let us have a parade!
- Ooh!

12:18.902 --> 12:20.945
Oh!

12:22.947 --> 12:26.993
Um, Puss?

12:27.076 --> 12:29.746
I have found it!

12:29.829 --> 12:31.831
The obelisk's secret location.

12:31.915 --> 12:33.208
Yes!

12:34.167 --> 12:37.629
Well, yes, only I found it
while you were mocking the Duchess.

12:37.712 --> 12:41.716
You crack me up!
Who remembers these things?

13:00.652 --> 13:02.195
Duchess, are you coming?

13:02.529 --> 13:05.448
Goodness, no.
That looks crazy dangerous.

13:05.865 --> 13:06.866
Fine, whatever.

13:07.450 --> 13:09.244
Everyone, stay behind me.

13:32.725 --> 13:35.478
I wonder how long
this place has been here.

13:36.771 --> 13:37.897
It smells old.

13:37.981 --> 13:39.816
Very old.

13:39.899 --> 13:42.902
No, that's just me.

13:44.737 --> 13:50.285
Ooh! Ohh-hoo-hoo!
Look at that!

13:50.493 --> 13:53.329
Hmm. Hmm.

13:54.998 --> 13:57.292
Hmm.

13:57.375 --> 13:58.251
I see.

13:58.334 --> 14:01.921
Yep! This is definitely made of stone.

14:02.380 --> 14:05.174
Also, oh, look!
These runes say that to use this

14:05.258 --> 14:07.802
you must be the One
from the Great Prophecy,

14:07.886 --> 14:10.471
who has the purest heart in the world.

14:10.722 --> 14:14.684
That is me. After all, I once nursed
a baby dragon back to health.

14:15.101 --> 14:16.811
And did all that other stuff too.

14:17.312 --> 14:20.398
The One must don the Crown of Souls.

14:20.690 --> 14:21.691
Which is this.

14:21.900 --> 14:24.736
And put their hand here
in this indentation.

14:26.696 --> 14:27.780
And then what?

14:27.989 --> 14:29.324
It doesn't say.

14:29.490 --> 14:32.660
And then we save the day.
Now if you will excuse me.

14:42.962 --> 14:44.339
Um, uh...

14:50.970 --> 14:55.058
Obelisk of Night!
It is I, the One from the Great Prophecy!

14:55.516 --> 14:57.393
I come bearing the Crown of Souls!

14:57.477 --> 15:00.271
Now...

15:08.655 --> 15:09.614
I command you!

15:17.080 --> 15:18.748
Destroy the Bloodwolf!

15:18.831 --> 15:19.832
Ha!

15:27.674 --> 15:29.175
Destroy the Bloodwolf.

15:30.093 --> 15:32.845
Destroy the Bloodwolf. Destroy it.

15:32.929 --> 15:36.224
Come on. Obelisk. Activate! Work.

15:36.307 --> 15:39.811
Come on. Turn on! Destroy it! Come on.

15:44.482 --> 15:47.026
Puss, look!
The fingers.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.154
Huh?

15:51.197 --> 15:52.031
Ugh!

15:53.449 --> 15:54.450
Ew!

15:54.534 --> 15:56.786
What kind of monster has four fingers?

15:56.869 --> 15:59.372
No matter.
I will just cut off one of my fingers.

15:59.455 --> 16:02.250
Even with nine fingers,
I will still be amazing.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.167
Puss!

16:07.505 --> 16:10.717
What!

16:10.800 --> 16:13.177
Gasp! She's only got four fingers.

16:13.261 --> 16:16.180
Oh, I know, it's weird.
I used to wear gloves.

16:17.724 --> 16:19.434
But that can only mean...

16:22.270 --> 16:23.896
Dulcinea is the One.

16:24.272 --> 16:27.442
Me? Oh, no.
I can't be!

16:30.486 --> 16:31.696
Of course you are.

16:33.364 --> 16:34.824
"The purest of heart."

16:35.325 --> 16:36.868
Who could that be but you?

16:37.452 --> 16:40.204
All this time,
I thought I was the great hero.

16:41.581 --> 16:42.540
And it was you.

16:44.751 --> 16:46.544
You are a great hero.

16:49.339 --> 16:51.049
Well, yes, this is true.

16:51.132 --> 16:54.093
And coming from the One,
it must be extra true!

16:54.177 --> 16:58.306
I am proud of you, Dulcinea.

16:59.182 --> 17:00.141
Thank you.

17:00.224 --> 17:03.603
There's so much I want to say,
so much I don't understand,

17:03.686 --> 17:05.605
but, right now, there's no time.

17:05.688 --> 17:06.646
Wish me luck.

17:12.069 --> 17:14.696
But, wait. It could be dangerous.

17:15.198 --> 17:16.699
It's our only hope, Puss.

17:17.032 --> 17:20.703
If I am the One,
then I was put here to do this very thing.

17:20.994 --> 17:22.246
It's my destiny.

17:24.040 --> 17:25.583
For San Lorenzo.

17:27.126 --> 17:28.502
For San Lorenzo.

17:29.587 --> 17:32.757
Dulcinea, I have something
that belongs to you.

18:03.204 --> 18:06.332
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.920
- Dulcinea!
- Puss!

19:10.688 --> 19:13.816
No, no, no, no!

19:14.192 --> 19:17.361
Dulcinea!
Where are you?

19:23.826 --> 19:28.122
Oh, I never should have let her
take the risk! This is my fault!

19:28.539 --> 19:31.292
It was her destiny, Puss.

19:32.543 --> 19:34.629
Get back up here quickly!

19:34.712 --> 19:38.508
There's something big
happening up above! We gotta go!

19:47.600 --> 19:49.310
Oh! That does not look good.

19:49.393 --> 19:51.521
- Eh, I'm sure it's nothing.
- What the...

19:54.398 --> 19:56.234
Uli? What is he doing up there?

19:59.779 --> 20:02.198
Uli, what is happening?

20:04.700 --> 20:07.286
It is the final piece of my plan.

20:08.329 --> 20:14.085
- Your plan?
- Yes. To resurrect das Blutwolf.

20:14.168 --> 20:17.755
- Uli, what are you saying?
- Surprised, Herr Boots?

20:18.047 --> 20:20.550
I needed you to find the Crown of Souls

20:20.633 --> 20:24.887
unt the Obelisk of Night,
not to defeat das Blutwolf

20:24.971 --> 20:28.307
but to allow his return
from the Netherworld!

20:28.808 --> 20:32.562
But why would you do this?
We are your friends.

20:33.020 --> 20:33.938
Nein.

20:34.564 --> 20:38.359
I have no friends.
I live only for das Blutwolf.

20:38.568 --> 20:41.195
So everything we did
to defend San Lorenzo...

20:41.279 --> 20:44.198
Has only brought about its destruction.

20:46.909 --> 20:50.413
But Dulcinea, she perished down there.

20:50.788 --> 20:52.290
Because she believed.

20:57.211 --> 21:01.757
So be it. I do not care.
Why would I care?

21:28.159 --> 21:29.285
Huh?

21:41.380 --> 21:44.091
Dogs!

21:45.092 --> 21:45.926
Gotcha!

21:46.510 --> 21:50.804
Thank you, Duchess.
Now, assemble the Senior Puss Squad!

22:08.741 --> 22:09.742
Oh!

22:25.633 --> 22:27.760
Hey, Puss. Yay!

22:30.096 --> 22:31.347
For Dulcinea.
