28:04.224 --> 28:05.266
Yeah.

28:11.357 --> 28:14.442
Yeah, my man, Bambi,

28:14.610 --> 28:16.444
ooh, he recommended you
real highly.

28:16.612 --> 28:20.031
He said, "Arthur Kirkland,
he the man to see."

28:20.199 --> 28:22.617
Okay, Ralph. Why don't you
tell me what happened.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.578
It says here in the report
that you were involved in a robbery.

28:25.746 --> 28:28.498
Uh-uh. No, sir.
Uh-uh. No.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.458
See... See, what happened is,

28:30.626 --> 28:32.794
it was time
to come down on the nigga.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.797
Mr. Kirkland, you know,
it's like smoking.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.007
They got to have
a nigga every 20 minutes.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.468
See, what happened is,

28:40.636 --> 28:43.763
I was in this alley petting my dog
when they came down on me.

28:43.931 --> 28:47.225
It states here that you were...
The dog was attacking you

28:47.393 --> 28:49.268
when you were first seen
in the alley.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.270
Yeah? Yeah, well...

28:51.438 --> 28:53.564
Well, see, my dog,
he gets like that sometimes.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.192
It also states that the dog

28:56.360 --> 28:58.236
belonged to a Mrs. B. Jackson.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.697
Well, he sure looked like my dog.

29:01.865 --> 29:04.575
You know, he had that...
Come on, Ralph.

29:04.743 --> 29:05.910
It also states here

29:06.078 --> 29:09.580
that when asked what you were
doing in the alley,

29:09.748 --> 29:13.960
you replied, "I don't know nothing
about that taxi-cab robbery."

29:14.128 --> 29:15.837
Now, that's true, because I don't.

29:16.880 --> 29:19.340
How'd you know
there was one, Ralph?

29:19.508 --> 29:21.509
Mr. Kirkland, there's always one.

29:21.677 --> 29:25.263
Ralph, tell me the truth
or get another lawyer.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.015
I don't need the bullshit. Let's go.

29:29.309 --> 29:30.810
Okay.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.938
I was in that cab. But I didn't rob it.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.189
It was my cousin's idea.

29:35.357 --> 29:39.735
I didn't know nothing. It was my
cousin's idea. See, he... He crazy.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.781
What's your cousin's name?
I don't know.

29:43.949 --> 29:45.700
I mean...

29:46.702 --> 29:48.035
He live over on Hillsdale.

29:48.203 --> 29:50.204
You don't know
your cousin's name?

29:50.372 --> 29:53.833
Ralph, who do you think
you're talking to?

29:54.042 --> 29:56.669
You think I'm an idiot?
Okay, I read a report,

29:56.837 --> 29:59.922
I can tell if somebody's
bullshitting me or not.

30:00.090 --> 30:01.966
Either you give me
straight answers

30:02.134 --> 30:03.551
or you get another lawyer.

30:03.719 --> 30:08.139
I don't have time to listen
to some jive-ass put me on.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.348
Okay.

30:11.727 --> 30:17.440
It wasn't my idea, but I did
know what was coming down.

30:17.858 --> 30:21.068
See, me and
my cousin Royce...

30:21.737 --> 30:23.988
Royce Shavers.

30:25.073 --> 30:30.912
See, he figures that
since I am the way I am...

30:32.873 --> 30:34.499
Mr. Kirkland,

30:34.666 --> 30:37.418
I can look real fine
sometimes, you know?

30:39.379 --> 30:40.922
Yeah,
I'm sure you can, Ralph.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.801
Well, Royce figures
that we can be a couple.

30:45.969 --> 30:48.179
You know, like a man
and a woman couple.

30:48.347 --> 30:51.432
Because a cab driver will pick
up a couple a whole lot faster

30:51.600 --> 30:54.310
than they will two nigga men.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.437
So, uh...

30:58.732 --> 31:03.027
we got into this cab over
on Garrison Boulevard,

31:04.112 --> 31:06.489
and we asked him to take us down
to the harbor.

31:06.657 --> 31:10.284
You know, like...
Like we was tourists.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.787
And, um...

31:16.542 --> 31:19.752
Hey, man, I...
I can't go to jail, man.

31:19.920 --> 31:23.881
I just can't do it.
I can't go to that place.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.009
Please, Mr. Kirkland,
you've got to help me.

31:27.177 --> 31:33.474
Please.

31:35.102 --> 31:36.143
Okay.
Please.

31:36.311 --> 31:39.647
Okay, I'll help you, Ralph.
Just don't lie to me, that's all.

31:39.982 --> 31:42.441
Okay? Okay.
Yes, sir.

31:45.112 --> 31:47.655
Thank you.
Don't lie to me. Okay?

31:47.823 --> 31:49.657
Yes, sir.
Okay.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.158
Thank you.

Thanks for bringing me home, Gail.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.171
[BOTH LAUGHING]

32:05.173 --> 32:07.049
Oh, God.

32:07.217 --> 32:09.010
Well...

32:09.177 --> 32:12.513
You really take renting
an unfurnished apartment
literally, don't you?

32:13.015 --> 32:15.349
Arthur, you know it doesn't
have to stay this way.

32:17.811 --> 32:18.894
What happened?

32:19.062 --> 32:22.023
Did your wife take you
in the divorce settlement?

32:22.524 --> 32:25.484
She had a better lawyer.
Oh.

32:27.029 --> 32:29.488
What about your kids?
Get to see them much?

32:29.656 --> 32:31.490
Well, they're in California,
you know.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.285
Phone calls, holidays.

32:34.995 --> 32:37.538
Put the food out,
I'll get the plates.

32:37.873 --> 32:41.709
I guess I was lucky.
We never had any kids.

32:41.877 --> 32:45.171
How long were you married?
Three years.

32:45.422 --> 32:49.133
Were you in love?
No.

32:49.509 --> 32:52.053
I was in love with the law.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.597
You know what I mean?

32:56.642 --> 32:58.184
Got a serving spoon?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.395
Serving spoon.

33:02.731 --> 33:03.939
Thank you.

33:05.901 --> 33:08.611
So, uh, you eat out a lot?

33:08.779 --> 33:09.904
Yeah, you?

33:10.072 --> 33:11.322
Yeah.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.159
The committee works
just about every night.

33:17.204 --> 33:20.247
How did you feel when you walked
out on the committee this morning?

33:20.415 --> 33:22.500
Did you feel all those daggers
in your back?

33:22.668 --> 33:25.127
That's a very
dangerous group, you know?

33:25.295 --> 33:26.837
Jesus.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.798
Here we go, here we go.

33:28.965 --> 33:31.342
Arthur, why?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.053
Why do you feel
it's dangerous?

33:34.221 --> 33:37.515
Because you're conning
the public into thinking
you're doing something.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.017
And you're not.
Yeah. But we are doing something.

33:40.185 --> 33:41.894
No.
We are protecting the public

33:42.062 --> 33:45.064
from a lot of corrupt lawyers,
is what we're doing.

33:45.816 --> 33:49.026
You're skimming the surface.
You're not going after
real power.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.112
[WHISTLES]

33:51.780 --> 33:55.574
Wow. That's scary.
What real power, Arthur?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.119
You don't know?
No, why don't you tell me?

33:58.286 --> 34:01.706
Well, now we know
they're definitely safe.

34:05.335 --> 34:08.713
What makes you think
you know so goddamn much?

34:09.630 --> 34:11.674
I don't know so much.
No, no. Tell me.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.301
What makes you the great
voice of authority?

34:14.469 --> 34:15.969
[CHUCKLES]

34:16.221 --> 34:19.556
I don't pretend to be
a voice of authority.

34:23.853 --> 34:26.938
It's just, I don't think
you know what you're doing,
that's all.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.484
Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah.

34:32.571 --> 34:35.322
This is nice,
don't you think?

34:35.489 --> 34:38.242
No, I don't find this
particularly nice.

34:38.409 --> 34:40.619
Arthur, I'm, um...

34:43.165 --> 34:45.206
I'm angry again.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.333
You know? I don't like being angry.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.420
It's not pleasant.
I don't understand

34:49.588 --> 34:52.005
how you can criticize me
for what I do.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.842
I'm not criticizing you, Gail.
I mean, you're taking it
too personally.

34:56.011 --> 34:59.847
Arthur, the committee is doing
something about what's going on.

35:00.015 --> 35:03.768
We are not sitting in jail at nights
because of contempt of court.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.563
Do you know what that's about?
Yeah.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.649
Yeah?
You threw a punch at Judge Fleming.

35:10.817 --> 35:14.361
Uh-huh. You know why?
I have no idea. Tell me.

35:14.654 --> 35:18.532
I got a client who's in jail
because of a faulty taillight

35:18.700 --> 35:20.159
and I can't get him out.

35:20.327 --> 35:22.578
What do you mean
you can't get him out?

35:22.746 --> 35:26.165
You wanna hear a story
about our wonderful judicial system?

35:26.333 --> 35:28.959
Hm?
Sure.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.212
There's a guy named
Jeff McCullaugh,

35:31.379 --> 35:34.590
and he's going down
the highway one night

35:35.217 --> 35:39.220
and the cops stop him
because his taillight isn't working.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.764
They pull him over to the side,
run a make on him.

35:41.932 --> 35:45.601
Computer kicks back
that there's a Jeff McCullaugh

35:45.769 --> 35:48.687
wanted in Alabama
for assault with a deadly weapon.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.731
Was this the same Jeff McCullaugh?
No.

35:50.899 --> 35:54.026
But he fits
the general description
so they arrest him.

35:54.194 --> 35:56.862
Why didn't McCullaugh tell them
they had the wrong person?

35:57.030 --> 36:00.115
He told the public defender,
who I don't think really believed him.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.700
And he was too busy.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.787
He never even bothered to check.
Are you serious?

36:05.288 --> 36:07.414
Ah, wait. It gets better.

36:07.916 --> 36:13.045
While Jeff is sitting in jail,
a guard is stabbed.

36:13.213 --> 36:16.006
And the knife is planted
in Jeff's cell.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.801
And Jeff is brought to trial
on a new charge,

36:18.969 --> 36:22.054
this time, assaulting a guard
with a deadly weapon.

36:22.222 --> 36:24.765
And a trial date is set

36:24.933 --> 36:28.435
six months from the time
he was first picked up.

36:30.021 --> 36:32.982
I'll make a long story short for you.
Six months go by

36:33.149 --> 36:37.152
and a very shaky, very crazy
Jeff McCullaugh goes to court.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.573
Now, the public defender
who's defending him, he says...

36:40.740 --> 36:44.243
He tells Jeff that he can get him off
Mm-hm.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.452
If he pleads guilty.

36:45.620 --> 36:48.205
He'll make a deal with the judge,
and he'll get him off.

36:48.373 --> 36:49.456
Time served.
Right.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.750
So he pleads guilty
even though he's innocent.

36:51.918 --> 36:55.462
That's right. However,
the deal was made
with a Judge Callahan.

36:55.630 --> 37:00.718
The day of the trial,
Judge Callahan cannot be found.

37:01.011 --> 37:02.970
Fleming is in his place.

37:03.138 --> 37:06.098
Fleming doesn't know
anything about the deal.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.518
Jeff pleads guilty.

37:09.686 --> 37:13.772
Fleming sentences Jeff
to five years in prison.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.400
[SIGHS]

37:16.985 --> 37:20.154
Goddamn.
So one little guy

37:20.322 --> 37:23.824
has already spent
a year and a half in jail

37:23.992 --> 37:25.784
because his lights didn't work.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.328
I've spent the last year

37:27.495 --> 37:30.873
putting together enough evidence
to prove he's innocent.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.124
And I prove it.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.294
I get it all together,
and I bring it into Fleming's court

37:35.462 --> 37:37.504
and he throws it out.

37:37.756 --> 37:41.425
Why?
Because it came in three days late.

37:44.971 --> 37:47.389
Holy shit.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.018
That's incredible.

37:51.186 --> 37:53.979
It's not incredible, it's Fleming.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.689
[CHUCKLES]

37:57.525 --> 38:01.528
No, Arthur. That's the law.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.530
You can't fault Fleming legally

38:03.698 --> 38:06.533
because he was going
by the letter of the law.

38:13.917 --> 38:16.126
Are you kidding?
No, I'm not.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.296
You talk to me like that,
you're not gonna get me
into bed, dear.

38:22.217 --> 38:23.968
Yes, I will.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.596

38:29.891 --> 38:31.725
You're so easy. Heh, heh.

38:31.893 --> 38:33.644
You knew that, huh?
Ha, ha, ha.

38:33.812 --> 38:35.813
That's why you went out
with me.

Finish your egg roll.
Ha, ha, ha.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.071

Who?
Take a guess.

Warren, please.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.619
This may sound crazy,

38:50.787 --> 38:53.956
but Judge Fleming
was just taken away.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.582
What do you mean,
taken away?

38:55.750 --> 38:57.793
Arrested.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.962
Come on.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.256
I'm telling you,
they just arrested the judge.

Your very own favorite judge.
Judge Fleming?

39:05.468 --> 39:06.844
Judge Fleming.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.221
What's the joke, Warren?

39:09.389 --> 39:11.807
There's a joke connected to this.
There is no joke.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.935
I don't know what it's about.
They're sitting on this very hard.

I can't get anything from anybody.
I'll see you later.

this morning and booked.

you'll never guess
what for.

What for?

named Ernest Drago?

55:48.679 --> 55:51.931
Sure. Yeah, Drago.
Yeah. What about him?

Well, you gave information
to the police on the q.t.

Drago was a nut.

Drago was insane.

on a burglary charge

that stuff every day.

56:11.243 --> 56:14.245
He would tell me these fantasies,
and one of his favorites was

56:14.413 --> 56:17.749
what would happen if he stuck
a firecracker in somebody's mouth?

56:17.916 --> 56:19.542
Yeah, that was
one of his favorites.

you didn't prevent a crime.

Of beating and raping
a woman.

01:41:38.593 --> 01:41:41.928
Arthur, you're talking crazy now.
You don't know he's guilty.

01:41:42.096 --> 01:41:44.014
You're making
an assumption he's guilty

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.683
because you hate him
so much, right?

01:41:46.851 --> 01:41:49.644
Even if he is, what difference
does it make? Come on.

01:41:49.812 --> 01:41:52.272
A defense lawyer has to defend
people who are guilty.

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.107
You know that.

01:41:58.112 --> 01:41:59.780
Would you defend him?

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:02.157
If you were me, would you do it?

01:42:03.075 --> 01:42:06.787
I would, Arthur,
because it's my job, you know?

01:42:08.206 --> 01:42:12.042
Look, you took an oath
to defend your clients

01:42:12.210 --> 01:42:13.710
to the best of your ability.

01:42:13.878 --> 01:42:17.714

01:43:12.854 --> 01:43:16.773
I've been carrying them around
for a couple of days.

01:43:16.941 --> 01:43:19.359
I'd like to know what they mean.

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:26.658
I see the wheels spinning.

01:43:26.826 --> 01:43:31.538
"Sex photos, sex crime. Is he guilty?"
Is he?

01:43:38.212 --> 01:43:39.254
Yes.

01:43:43.134 --> 01:43:46.136
What about the polygraph?

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:49.931
The eyewitness? How'd you do that?

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:52.809
Those were taken care of for me.

01:43:57.648 --> 01:43:59.190
So...

01:44:01.319 --> 01:44:03.403
So now you have it.

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:11.494
Well, I'll see you in court, Arthur.

01:44:17.043 --> 01:44:20.170
Oh. You forgot these.

01:44:31.849 --> 01:44:34.142
So you're home on leave.

01:44:36.812 --> 01:44:39.356
Arthur's in the Coast Guard.

01:44:41.734 --> 01:44:43.526
I don't understand.
He's getting worse.

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:46.154
It depends. He comes, he goes.

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.867
You didn't come
for three weeks.

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:52.827
He missed you
very much.

01:44:52.995 --> 01:44:56.039
Oh, yeah, well,
I was busy, Arnie.

01:44:56.207 --> 01:44:58.875
You know,
I had the trial and all.

It's important to you.

01:45:02.505 --> 01:45:05.548
But you missed three Tuesdays,
so he lost his sense of time.

You know, Arnie,

01:45:10.137 --> 01:45:13.056
I don't know what I'd do if he goes.

He's the only family I got.

01:45:18.062 --> 01:45:19.354
He's very proud of you.

01:45:23.859 --> 01:45:27.737
I'm a lawyer because of him.

01:45:32.118 --> 01:45:36.663
He wanted it for me,
and he made sure I got it.

To him,

01:45:39.667 --> 01:45:44.087

my name is Arthur Kirkland,
and I am the defense counsel

01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:18.241
for the defendant,
Judge Henry T. Fleming.

01:48:21.579 --> 01:48:24.497
Now, that man over there,
he's the prosecuting attorney,

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:28.668
and he couldn't be happier today.

01:48:29.962 --> 01:48:31.796
He is a happy man today,

01:48:31.964 --> 01:48:35.758
because today he's going
after a judge.

01:48:36.594 --> 01:48:38.887

[PEOPLE LAUGHING]

01:48:52.526 --> 01:48:55.445
Now, in order to win this case,

01:48:55.613 --> 01:48:57.947
he needs you.

01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:01.743
Naturally.
You're all he's got, believe me.

01:49:01.911 --> 01:49:06.414
So he's counting on tapping
that emotion in you which says:

01:49:06.582 --> 01:49:10.877
"Let's get somebody in power.
Let's get a judge."

01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:14.797
However, these proceedings
are not about that.

01:49:14.965 --> 01:49:20.386
These proceedings are here
to see that justice is done.

01:49:21.138 --> 01:49:24.974
And justice is, as any
reasonable person would tell you,

01:49:25.142 --> 01:49:27.560
the finding of the truth.

01:49:27.728 --> 01:49:30.521
And what is the truth today?

01:49:31.982 --> 01:49:34.567
One truth, a tragic one,

01:49:34.735 --> 01:49:37.987
is that that girl
has been beaten and raped.

01:49:38.155 --> 01:49:39.155
Another truth

01:49:39.323 --> 01:49:42.784
is that the prosecution
doesn't have a witness.

01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:47.163
Does not have one piece
of substantiating evidence,

01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:51.834
other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

01:49:53.003 --> 01:49:57.840
Another truth
is that my client voluntarily...

01:49:58.008 --> 01:50:00.468
And the prosecution
is well aware of this fact.

01:50:00.636 --> 01:50:03.137
Voluntarily took a lie-detector test...

He told the truth.

The jury will disregard that remark.

Polygraph tests have not
been proven 100 percent reliable.

01:50:14.525 --> 01:50:16.693

Let's get back to justice.

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:27.829
What is justice?

01:50:28.372 --> 01:50:31.749
What is the intention of justice?

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.377
The intention of justice

01:50:34.545 --> 01:50:37.463
is to see that the guilty people
are proven guilty

01:50:37.631 --> 01:50:40.049
and that the innocent are freed.

01:50:40.884 --> 01:50:42.719
Simple, isn't it?

01:50:43.595 --> 01:50:46.222
Only it's not that simple.

01:50:47.099 --> 01:50:51.811

it is the defense counselor's duty

01:50:51.979 --> 01:50:54.063
to protect the rights
of the individual

01:50:54.231 --> 01:50:56.566
as it is the prosecution's duty

01:50:56.734 --> 01:51:01.279
to uphold and defend
the laws of the state.

01:51:01.822 --> 01:51:03.906
Justice for all.

01:51:06.285 --> 01:51:08.661
Only we have a problem here.

regardless of who's guilty
or innocent.

01:51:32.770 --> 01:51:34.812

He is so carried away
with the prospect of winning,

the idea, that he forgot something

that's absolutely essential
to today's proceedings.

01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:58.961
He forgot his case.

01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:01.047

Not one piece
of substantiating evidence

other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

01:52:16.939 --> 01:52:21.776

and I couldn't get rid of it,
that haunted me,

was why.

01:53:01.024 --> 01:53:04.152
Why would she lie?

01:53:06.155 --> 01:53:08.322
What was her motive for lying?

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:12.869
If my client is innocent, she's lying.

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:14.537
Why?

01:53:16.290 --> 01:53:18.291
Was it blackmail?

01:53:19.585 --> 01:53:21.002
No.

01:53:22.421 --> 01:53:24.380
Was it jealousy?

01:53:24.673 --> 01:53:26.215
No.

01:53:28.427 --> 01:53:30.553
Yesterday,

01:53:30.721 --> 01:53:33.806
I found out why.

01:53:38.729 --> 01:53:42.064
She doesn't have a motive.

01:53:44.234 --> 01:53:45.902
You know why?

01:53:48.489 --> 01:53:50.990
Because she's not lying.

01:53:52.576 --> 01:53:55.244
And ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

01:53:56.622 --> 01:53:58.998
the prosecution

01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:03.211
is not gonna get
that man today.

01:54:03.378 --> 01:54:04.962
No.

01:54:05.130 --> 01:54:08.174
Because I'm gonna get him.

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:10.635
