WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.377
Now we're looking
for two binomials

00:05.589 --> 00:08.377
that multiply
to get the given trinomial.

00:08.592 --> 00:09.548
<i>Whenever I wasn't being</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:11.171
<i>challenged intellectually,</i>

00:11.386 --> 00:14.629
<i>my brain was more than happy
to step up and accommodate.</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:17.682
<i>It was like having the perfect
playmate in my skull.</i>

00:21.897 --> 00:25.061
Sir, the COBE satellite is going
into an uncontrolled spin.

00:25.275 --> 00:26.186
So fix it!

00:26.401 --> 00:28.188
We can't. Our computer programs
weren't designed

00:28.403 --> 00:29.644
to handle a chaotic system.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.150
Darn it! If only someone could
calculate the maneuver

00:32.366 --> 00:33.573
and make it stable again!

00:33.784 --> 00:35.491
<i>There is someone.</i>

00:36.620 --> 00:37.736
And it's me.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.574
You're just a kid.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.702
A kid who knows to
add an x-cubed term

00:41.917 --> 00:43.579
to a simple harmonic oscillator.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.877
If you extend the solar panel
by one meter,

00:46.088 --> 00:47.704
you'll save your satellite.

00:48.715 --> 00:50.547
You heard him. Do it!

00:51.593 --> 00:53.585
- Right away.
<i>- Sheldon?</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:54.464
Sheldon?

00:56.223 --> 00:57.930
Were you paying attention
to anything I said?

00:58.350 --> 00:59.010
Yes.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.216
Then what'd I say?

01:00.435 --> 01:01.892
When factoring a trinomial

01:02.104 --> 01:03.936
where the leading coefficient
isn't one,

01:04.147 --> 01:05.854
it must be written
in descending order

01:06.066 --> 01:08.103
from highest power
to lowest power.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.685
Well... yeah.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.526
<i>You'll save your satellite.</i>

01:15.033 --> 01:17.275
You heard him. Do it!

01:22.708 --> 01:24.620
It worked.
The satellite is stable!

01:24.835 --> 01:25.951
Yes!

01:29.756 --> 01:30.746
Thanks, kid.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.707
You really saved my bottom.

01:33.302 --> 01:35.635
Tell your bottom,
"It's welcome."

01:59.119 --> 02:01.736
And bless our appetites,
both physical and spiritual,

02:01.955 --> 02:04.242
to honor You in all we do.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.448
In Jesus' name.

02:05.709 --> 02:07.245
What happened to "Bless
the hands that prepared it"?

02:07.711 --> 02:09.327
I thought I'd mix it up.

02:09.588 --> 02:10.624
I miss the old one.

02:10.839 --> 02:11.625
Me, too.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.172
Yeah, what I like
about the other one...

02:13.383 --> 02:14.464
And bless the hands
that prepared it.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.338
- Amen.
- Amen.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.841
So, how was
everybody's day?

02:20.390 --> 02:21.926
I'm done with high school.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.098
What does that mean?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.596
Well, I don't
learn anything there,

02:24.811 --> 02:26.097
and I don't want to go anymore.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.434
Well, where do you think
you're gonna go?

02:28.649 --> 02:30.015
Who cares?
Let him go.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.099
Shh. Well?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.561
I've been corresponding
with Dr. John Sturgis

02:34.780 --> 02:35.987
at East Texas Tech.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.110
He said I could audit
his course.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.692
You're pen pals with a
stranger? Is this okay?

02:40.911 --> 02:43.995
He's not a stranger.
He's a famous scientist.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.914
He carbon-dated
the oldest human feces.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.870
That ain't strange.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.077
Now, Shelly,
I appreciate that you want

02:51.296 --> 02:53.663
to expand your horizons, but how
would you even get there?

02:53.882 --> 02:54.838
The school's an hour away.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.712
<i>I'm working,
your dad's working.</i>

02:56.927 --> 02:59.340
Again, who cares?
Let him go.

02:59.554 --> 03:00.385
He could hitchhike.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.383
Perfect.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.884
It's only one day a week,

03:03.100 --> 03:04.762
and I was hoping
Meemaw could take me.

03:08.397 --> 03:10.389
I'm gonna start eating
dinner at my house.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.478
You better make
a whole lot of money

03:17.698 --> 03:19.610
and take care of
me when I'm old.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.316
I'm not interested
in money.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.572
I'm interested
in the pursuit of knowledge.

03:23.787 --> 03:26.154
That is the wrong
thing to say to someone

03:26.373 --> 03:28.865
who is spending her Friday
night as your chauffeur.

03:29.418 --> 03:32.001
Did you know the word chauffeur
is French for "stoker,"

03:32.212 --> 03:34.795
because the first automobiles
were steam-powered,

03:35.006 --> 03:36.998
and the driver had
to stoke the engine?

03:37.217 --> 03:39.709
Right there. Why am I
driving you to college

03:39.928 --> 03:41.965
when you already
know everything?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.510
<i>I didn't know everything,</i>

03:44.725 --> 03:46.933
<i>but compared to her friends
at water aerobics,</i>

03:47.144 --> 03:49.010
<i>I could see
how it felt that way.</i>

03:51.606 --> 03:53.097
Okay, this is you.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.308
Good luck.

03:56.278 --> 03:58.895
Aren't you going to walk me in
and get me situated?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.026
Oh, yes, of course.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.574
Right this way, my prince.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.580
<i>Why are they all
looking at us?</i>

04:14.171 --> 04:16.458
I think they're
looking at you.

04:16.673 --> 04:19.086
Oh. Hello.

04:20.677 --> 04:21.666
There you go.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.551
Okay, you all situated?

04:25.766 --> 04:27.382
I believe so, yes.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.308
- I'll be right outside.
- Are you sure

04:29.519 --> 04:32.387
you don't want to stay and learn
about quantum chromodynamics?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.598
And spoil the fun of you
telling me all about it

04:34.816 --> 04:36.057
on the ride home?

04:36.276 --> 04:37.232
No way.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.400
Smart.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.276
That's my meemaw.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.319
<i>- He's really ours?
- Thank you.</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:50.245
<i>Oh, come on,
you done all the work.</i>

04:50.457 --> 04:52.824
<i>Adrian, I can't believe
you done this.</i>

04:53.168 --> 04:54.875
Can you help me?

04:55.086 --> 04:55.917
With what?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.916
I don't understand
my homework.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.087
You're asking <i>me?</i>

04:59.299 --> 05:00.915
I don't understand
my own homework.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.716
I know, but you're all I got.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.174
What kind of homework
is it?

05:06.848 --> 05:07.838
Grammar.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.258
I ain't great
with grammar.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.220
Well, grammar's just talking,
and we both talk good.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.850
I guess. Gimme.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.527
There's a list of sentences,
and you're supposed to say

05:21.738 --> 05:23.855
if each one's a complete
sentence or not.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.607
<i>The first one is,</i>

05:25.826 --> 05:27.283
<i>"Most people
in the country."</i>

05:28.411 --> 05:29.743
That doesn't sound
like a sentence.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.696
But ask me who drives
pickup trucks.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.323
Who drives pickup trucks?

05:34.543 --> 05:36.125
Most people in the country.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.293
Well, now it does
sound like one.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.462
I told you, it's confusing.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.252
I can't help you.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.004
<i>If you don't want me
mixing with Creed no more...</i>

05:49.140 --> 05:51.052
Do you think we're stupid?

05:51.893 --> 05:53.304
Sheldon's in college
right now,

05:53.520 --> 05:55.102
and we can't figure out
<i>your</i> homework.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.520
What do you think?

05:57.065 --> 05:59.478
Sometimes I tell myself
I only look stupid

05:59.693 --> 06:01.059
because he's so smart.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.486
<i>Win.</i>

06:07.909 --> 06:08.990
Give me the book.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.665
Don't just sit there,
make me a sandwich.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.038
Coming up.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.548
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.303
Forgive me, but is that pattern
a double basket weave?

06:33.518 --> 06:35.851
Um, I suppose so.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.896
I've always just called it
a "loop-loop whoopsie-do."

06:41.234 --> 06:43.191
Well, it's very
impressive.

06:43.612 --> 06:44.443
Do you knit?

06:44.654 --> 06:47.863
No, but it's always
intrigued me.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.486
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

06:49.701 --> 06:53.035
the first computer
was a loom.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.324
Is that so?

06:54.539 --> 06:55.370
It is.

06:56.166 --> 06:57.247
Well, okay.

06:57.459 --> 06:58.791
Okay.

07:00.086 --> 07:03.454
Well, if you'll
excuse me, uh,

07:04.049 --> 07:05.415
I have a class to teach.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.297
Oh, you must be
my grandson's pen pal.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.297
I'm sorry?

07:09.512 --> 07:10.753
Sheldon Cooper.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.840
The nine-year-old with
the flawless penmanship.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.766
I look forward
to meeting him.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.809
Well, he's right in there.
You can't miss him.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.137
- He's about yea big.
- Oh.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.227
An-An-And will you
be joining us?

07:22.442 --> 07:25.935
Will you be discussing
quantum chromodynamics?

07:26.154 --> 07:27.235
I certainly hope so.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.155
- Then I don't think so.
<i>- Are you sure?</i>

07:30.367 --> 07:34.031
Every day is a chance
to learn something new.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.120
Can I ask questions?

07:36.331 --> 07:38.414
Well, how else
can you learn?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.082
Well, let's do it, then.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.415
My name's John.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.747
And I'm Connie.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.582
My middle name's Whitney.

07:48.009 --> 07:49.921
And now I know that.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.926
Well, I'm so glad
you enjoyed it.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.057
So, Sheldon, what did you think

07:57.268 --> 07:59.851
of your first
theoretical physics class?

08:00.689 --> 08:03.022
I think I'm gonna do this
for the rest of my life.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.599
Good choice.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.234
Connie, I would like
to see you again.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.528
Perhaps we could
have dinner sometime.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.731
Yes, we would love that.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.194
We would?

08:13.410 --> 08:14.025
We wouldn't?

08:14.244 --> 08:15.200
You wouldn't?

08:15.662 --> 08:16.618
We would.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.196
Excellent.

08:18.415 --> 08:20.532
Excellent.
So, where are we eating?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.993
Okay, this says,
"A complete sentence

08:24.212 --> 08:25.794
always contains a verb."

08:26.006 --> 08:27.338
Which one's a verb?

08:27.549 --> 08:30.087
"A verb is a word that
describes an action.

08:30.301 --> 08:32.964
I <i>play</i> checkers.
You <i>eat</i> spaghetti."

08:33.638 --> 08:35.470
We <i>suck</i> at homework.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.889
The action is sucking.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.719
So, the first one
on your homework is,

08:38.934 --> 08:40.676
"Most people
in the country."

08:41.187 --> 08:42.519
I don't see
an action word.

08:42.731 --> 08:44.097
Neither do I.

08:44.649 --> 08:47.357
Georgie, I don't think
this is a sentence.

08:47.569 --> 08:48.730
I think you're right.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.186
Now I just have
to fix it.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.192
Put a verb in there, girl.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.986
I think you might be getting
a little ahead of yourself.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.538
I don't think so.
They're in love.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.241
They were looking into
each other's eyes

09:03.460 --> 09:04.541
like there was
something in there

09:04.753 --> 09:06.585
other than corneas
and irises.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.418
Well, if that's the case,
that'd be wonderful.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.214
It'd be more than wonderful.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.463
If they get married,
we immediately double

09:13.678 --> 09:15.670
the number of smart people
in our family.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.593
That means we go
from one to two.

09:18.808 --> 09:19.798
I got that.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.552
So, did you understand
any of it?

09:22.771 --> 09:24.137
Not a word.

09:24.355 --> 09:27.519
But he had on a tweed jacket
with the elbow patches,

09:27.734 --> 09:30.101
so he must know
what he's talking about.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.437
Boy, Sheldon's fired up.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.112
Oh, he loved it.

09:34.324 --> 09:36.190
He sat there for
an hour and a half

09:36.409 --> 09:38.446
just as happy as
a pig in poop.

09:38.661 --> 09:39.947
He mentioned you were
pretty happy

09:40.163 --> 09:41.779
about the whole experience, too.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.365
Well, I guess
Mr. Wizard did take

09:44.584 --> 09:45.870
a bit of a shine to me.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.076
What's that mean?

09:47.295 --> 09:49.207
It means he asked
me out to dinner.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.412
No big deal.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.998
So, you going?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.800
When have you known me
to turn down a free meal?

09:55.011 --> 09:56.047
Ain't that the truth.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.633
Says the Pillsbury Doughboy.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.389
Ain't that the truth.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.977
I do have feelings, y'all.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.319
Don't put on too much of that.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.987
We want him to like you
for your mind.

10:15.198 --> 10:17.815
I think I know what I'm doing
when it comes to men.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.321
If that's true,
then why do you live alone?

10:20.537 --> 10:23.405
Because my husband died.
Any other questions?

10:24.791 --> 10:26.032
He's here!

10:26.251 --> 10:27.207
I'll get it.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.498
Maybe that is a bit much.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.049
- Hello, Dr. Sturgis.
- Hello, Sheldon.

10:36.261 --> 10:39.220
Come in. Meemaw's upstairs
getting ready for your date.

10:39.430 --> 10:40.966
Wonderful.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.426
Oh, my, this is a lovely house.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.346
Isn't it? Can you see
yourself living here?

10:48.565 --> 10:49.726
I can.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.568
Here are some things you might
find helpful about Meemaw.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.236
Her favorite color
is purple,

10:56.447 --> 10:58.188
mint chip,

10:58.408 --> 11:00.024
and her favorite food
is Mexican.

11:00.243 --> 11:01.859
Excellent.
Good to know.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.616
She loves gambling, bowling,
and especially me.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.239
You can't talk enough
about me.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.081
Tell me more about you.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.455
- My favorite color is blue.
- Mine, too.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.333
- Vanilla.
- Good man.

11:13.548 --> 11:15.881
Spaghetti
with hot dogs cut up in it.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.253
I've never had that.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.425
- What's your favorite food?
- Grilled cheese.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.969
What about the risk
of mouth burn?

11:21.556 --> 11:25.425
It's a perfect excuse
for vanilla ice cream.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.552
If you want to propose tonight,
you have my blessing.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.846
Hello, boys.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.016
Hello, Connie.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.980
These are for you.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.358
Aw, thank you.
They're beautiful.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.280
Some of them are purple.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.446
So they are.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.402
I should probably get 'em
into some water.

11:45.622 --> 11:46.612
I can do that.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.992
You two begin
your courtship.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.540
- Moonpie.
- Yes?

11:49.918 --> 11:50.749
Go home.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.335
So you can begin
the courtship, got it.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.411
Go!

11:55.173 --> 11:56.254
Dr. Sturgis,

11:56.466 --> 11:58.503
I just want you to know
I couldn't be more pleased.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.756
Well,
let me take care of these,

12:04.974 --> 12:06.090
and then we'll head out.

12:06.517 --> 12:07.724
I just need to

12:07.936 --> 12:09.893
borrow your phone to call a cab.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.057
Why?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.558
I don't drive.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.981
Well, how did you get here?

12:15.193 --> 12:17.105
I rode my bicycle.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.319
You rode your bicycle?

12:19.530 --> 12:21.988
I have a Schwinn Speedster.

12:22.200 --> 12:26.035
It's got three gears.
I only use one.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.572
I tell you what, how
about we take my car?

12:29.791 --> 12:30.827
Excellent.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.829
So, would you be opposed

12:33.127 --> 12:35.244
to me sitting in the back seat?

12:35.463 --> 12:38.297
It's statistically
the safest part of the car.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.083
Actually, I would.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.423
Asked and answered.

13:03.533 --> 13:04.944
<i>Did you cry
when you saw it?</i>

13:05.159 --> 13:06.024
No.

13:06.244 --> 13:07.200
<i>Why not?</i>

13:07.412 --> 13:08.994
'Cause it ain't
that big a deal.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.195
<i>Okay.</i>

13:15.295 --> 13:16.502
<i>Did you hang it
on your wall?</i>

13:16.713 --> 13:17.829
Get out of here!

13:18.548 --> 13:20.585
<i>I'm telling people you cried.</i>

13:21.092 --> 13:22.754
Do you like guacamole?

13:23.052 --> 13:24.042
I don't know.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.300
Being from Maine, we didn't have
much Mexican food.

13:27.932 --> 13:31.050
Or Mexican people.
Or people.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.352
It's just mashed up avocados.
I think you'd like it.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.225
And they do it right
here at the table.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.772
Did they run out of room
in the kitchen?

13:38.443 --> 13:40.981
No, it's-it's like,
you know, a show.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.482
- Like Benihana.
- Exactly.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.192
I don't like Benihana.

13:45.408 --> 13:47.866
- Let's skip the guacamole.
<i>- No, no.</i>

13:48.077 --> 13:50.114
You like it,
and I want this date

13:50.330 --> 13:52.788
to be appealing to you,
so let's order it.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.239
Okay.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.413
I might enjoy it.
I might not.

13:57.628 --> 14:00.871
But, uh, I'm willing
to take that gamble.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.252
Which, uh,
I'm given to understand

14:03.468 --> 14:05.755
you also like.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.759
Oh, that little rat just
told you everything, didn't he?

14:10.850 --> 14:14.264
Don't feel bad, I enjoy
a little gambling now and then.

14:14.937 --> 14:15.848
Do you?

14:16.064 --> 14:17.930
I sat in your front seat,
didn't I?

14:20.276 --> 14:22.359
Good, I made you laugh.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.529
Full disclosure,
I wasn't trying to be funny.

14:28.659 --> 14:29.740
Still not trying.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.075
They're not gonna
be back for a while.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.250
Go to bed.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.121
I won't be able to sleep.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.456
I'm not telling you
to go to sleep,

14:43.674 --> 14:44.755
I'm telling you to go to bed.

14:45.426 --> 14:46.041
You don't think

14:46.260 --> 14:48.172
they'll have relations tonight,
do you?

14:48.388 --> 14:49.924
Now I'm telling you
to go to sleep.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.715
So, John, you ever
been married?

14:52.934 --> 14:54.266
- No.
- Hmm.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.059
Ever been in love?

14:56.562 --> 14:57.769
Seven times.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.391
<i>Seven times?</i>

14:59.607 --> 15:01.098
How come you never
settled down?

15:01.317 --> 15:04.401
Well, my feelings
were not reciprocated.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.478
Well, that's so sad.

15:06.697 --> 15:07.778
Not for them.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.027
They all seemed pleased
with the outcome.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.109
Especially number four.

15:12.328 --> 15:14.741
She said she
dodged a bullet.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.332
That is a very brave thing
to say on a first date.

15:18.543 --> 15:19.624
Why?

15:19.836 --> 15:21.543
If there's a second date,
I'll tell you.

15:22.547 --> 15:24.584
I have a chance
at a second date?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.633
This is going very well.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.427
Try the guacamole.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.964
<i>No, no, no.
With a chip.</i>

15:34.559 --> 15:35.174
Oh.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.885
<i>Okay.</i>

15:39.021 --> 15:40.353
Like this.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.060
There you go.

15:44.152 --> 15:45.313
Mmm!

15:46.863 --> 15:49.822
Now, how do
chimichangas work?

15:50.032 --> 15:51.819
I have no idea.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.697
Well, I think we should try
and find out.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.489
How'd it go?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.951
Oh! What the hell?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.794
I wanted to know
how your date went,

16:04.005 --> 16:05.541
and I got bored
watching you sleep.

16:06.007 --> 16:07.794
How long have you been there?

16:08.176 --> 16:09.508
67 minutes.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.130
Now, tell me everything.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.591
Go away.
Let me sleep.

16:14.098 --> 16:14.713
Okay.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.093
But before I go,
should I be worried

16:16.309 --> 16:17.220
he's not in your bed?

16:17.435 --> 16:18.801
Get out!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.849
I certainly hope
you were nicer to him.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.225
<i>Out!</i>

16:24.442 --> 16:25.853
So, are you gonna
see him again?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.184
I don't know.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.521
He showed up at my
house on a bike.

16:30.990 --> 16:31.901
Like a Harley?

16:32.325 --> 16:33.611
Like a Schwinn.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.283
You mean a <i>bike</i> bike?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.203
With a jingle bell on the
handlebar and everything.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.201
Well, that's kind of charming.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.032
He doesn't know how
to drive a car.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.207
Doesn't want to know.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.411
Okay, a little
less charming.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.087
There's something about him.

16:47.298 --> 16:51.042
I mean, he's smart as hell,
and gentle and funny.

16:51.260 --> 16:54.128
Not always on purpose,
but he's funny.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.301
I never met anybody
like him.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.091
Sounds like Sheldon.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.721
Now, why would you go

17:00.937 --> 17:03.645
and put that thought
in my mind?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.229
Well, I think you should

17:05.441 --> 17:06.602
give him another try.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.398
I agree with Mom.

17:08.611 --> 17:09.442
Sheldon!

17:16.743 --> 17:18.484
Oh, no.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.500
Aw.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.754
<i>So, now we can discuss</i>

17:36.973 --> 17:41.343
<i>what the perturbative QCD
corrections to R-bar look like.</i>

17:41.561 --> 17:44.099
So, you can also
write it as "R"

17:44.313 --> 17:45.804
divided by the length of "R."

17:46.983 --> 17:49.396
That would be a vector

17:49.986 --> 17:52.228
of unit length...

17:53.322 --> 17:54.654
...parallel...

17:56.033 --> 17:57.365
to "R."

18:00.580 --> 18:01.912
I'm sorry, where was I?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.534
"R" divided by
the length of "R."

18:03.749 --> 18:04.739
That would be a vector

18:04.959 --> 18:06.450
of unit length
parallel to "R."

18:06.669 --> 18:08.752
Oh, yes. Thank you.

18:09.171 --> 18:13.632
So, if you divide "R"
by the length of "R,"

18:14.176 --> 18:16.418
that would be a vector...

18:17.638 --> 18:20.176
of unit length parallel...

18:21.517 --> 18:22.758
to...

18:23.936 --> 18:26.098
I think you need to leave.

18:32.987 --> 18:33.602
<i>So...</i>

18:33.821 --> 18:34.982
when we divide "R"

18:35.197 --> 18:36.483
by the length of "R,"

18:36.699 --> 18:39.817
that would be a vector
of unit length

18:40.036 --> 18:43.450
parallel to "R."

18:50.463 --> 18:51.499
Sir, bad news.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.421
Don't tell me.
There's another problem

18:53.633 --> 18:55.215
we're not smart
enough to solve?

18:55.426 --> 18:57.668
It's the satellite... the liquid
helium is boiling off.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.549
Well, why the heck
would that happen?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.300
<i>I'll tell you why.</i>

19:02.266 --> 19:03.973
The sun must be glinting off
the solar panel

19:04.185 --> 19:05.221
and hitting the dewar.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.517
Why didn't you know that?

19:06.729 --> 19:07.936
I'm a disappointment, sir.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.139
We need to calculate
all the Euler angles

19:10.358 --> 19:12.270
that would cause the sun
to hit the liquid helium.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.396
Can you do it in time?

19:13.611 --> 19:16.274
I can with my new friend,
Dr. John Sturgis.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.195
Hello.

19:19.825 --> 19:20.906
Hi.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.575
He's gonna marry
my meemaw.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.115
I bought her a bicycle.

19:25.331 --> 19:27.072
A <i>purple</i> bicycle.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.908
Purple?
Sounds like love to me.

19:34.548 --> 19:35.379
Mr. Cooper?!

19:35.591 --> 19:36.206
Huh?

19:37.051 --> 19:38.667
Are you paying attention?

19:39.095 --> 19:40.506
I already know this.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.762
You know this?

19:43.099 --> 19:45.557
But they don't,
so by all means, continue.
