00:52.042 --> 00:54.288
Buffalo Bill's Western Extravaganza

00:54.324 --> 00:57.362
has rolled into town, and
all your favourites are here.

00:57.482 --> 01:00.104
Meet the world's greatest sharpshooter...

01:00.139 --> 01:01.858
Annie Oakley!

01:03.961 --> 01:06.798
Hank 'Lightning' Wilcox and Jaws McRawlins,

01:07.344 --> 01:10.825
the daring duo that
tamed the wild frontier!

01:11.684 --> 01:14.395
The most dangerous gun in the west:

01:14.422 --> 01:16.524
Bounty hunter John Warton!

01:16.525 --> 01:20.383
And of course, the legendary
Buffalo Bill himself!

01:28.597 --> 01:30.503
Welcome!

01:30.745 --> 01:32.569
Hang on to your hats, folks.

01:32.570 --> 01:35.953
You're in for a rootin' tootin' good time!

01:38.619 --> 01:40.275
Oh... Bollocks!

01:40.570 --> 01:42.479
- Probably the wind.
- Yes.

01:42.599 --> 01:45.035
Bloody rope's probably too
short. That's what it is.

01:45.068 --> 01:47.111
Perhaps Detective Murdoch
would have better luck.

01:47.504 --> 01:50.571
These games are all as bent
as a nine-bob note anyway.

01:50.969 --> 01:53.674
I have a good mind to charge
the fellow who's running it and

01:53.676 --> 01:55.739
arrest him for making
money under false pretenses.

01:55.766 --> 01:56.983
Pardon me, Sir.

02:03.282 --> 02:05.702
They need to have the
occasional winner, Sir.

02:05.822 --> 02:08.911
- To make the game seem legitimate.
- Yes, yes...

02:10.441 --> 02:12.329
- Perhaps you should have this.
- No,

02:12.562 --> 02:13.958
Murdoch, why don't you wear it?

02:13.985 --> 02:16.088
Oh, I think it would
look much better on you.

02:16.208 --> 02:18.469
I'd need about four large
scotches inside me before

02:18.486 --> 02:20.556
that came anywhere near
my head, me old mucker.

02:20.558 --> 02:21.591
It's a shame.

02:21.627 --> 02:23.543
Hat like that cries out to be worn.

02:23.794 --> 02:26.003
Five minutes to showtime.

02:27.194 --> 02:29.252
Ladies and gentlemen!

02:29.736 --> 02:33.181
Now the wild wild west was one dusty world.

02:33.826 --> 02:37.342
And it was just crawling
with every kinda scoundrel

02:37.351 --> 02:39.328
and outlaw that there was.

02:39.448 --> 02:41.109
But the worst man

02:41.229 --> 02:44.348
the most feared man in the wild wild west,

02:44.375 --> 02:46.326
was one Chester McGee!

02:46.446 --> 02:49.825
That's right. 'Cause he
was a stone-cold killer!

02:51.377 --> 02:54.442
Now, one day this killer,

02:54.486 --> 02:57.296
like every killer, met his match.

02:57.341 --> 02:58.997
In the persons of

02:59.883 --> 03:04.365
Lightning Wilcox and his
partner, Jaws McRawlins.

03:04.392 --> 03:06.450
Let's hear it for these boys.

03:07.927 --> 03:12.160
Chester McGee, he was
causing a lot of problems.

03:12.697 --> 03:15.095
So that Sheriff over there in Carson City,

03:15.131 --> 03:16.384
he called out for help.

03:16.504 --> 03:18.710
And that's when he called on us!

03:23.868 --> 03:26.737
- You're my hero!
- So... Lightning

03:26.755 --> 03:28.679
and his partner Jaws,

03:28.799 --> 03:31.579
they just followed that Chester McGee

03:31.582 --> 03:33.548
to the ends of the earth!

03:33.550 --> 03:35.114
And then they finally found him;

03:35.140 --> 03:37.270
coulda shot him right there too.

03:37.721 --> 03:39.554
Would that have been a fair fight?

03:39.556 --> 03:40.921
No!

03:41.041 --> 03:44.374
So Hank 'Lightning' Wilcox
took out a six-shooter,

03:44.375 --> 03:45.949
placed it on that dusty floor,

03:45.994 --> 03:48.187
kicked it across to ol' Chester McGee.

03:48.401 --> 03:50.469
Then he turned his back on him.

03:51.033 --> 03:54.268
And as Chester goes down
for that six-shooter...

03:54.479 --> 03:58.793
Lightning spun around and shot
him right between the eyes!

03:59.204 --> 04:01.423
So ladies and gentlemen,

04:01.969 --> 04:06.703
for you today, the most
terrifying stunt ever performed

04:07.034 --> 04:10.291
in front of a live and paying audience,

04:10.524 --> 04:12.197
by Hank 'Lightning' Wilcox

04:12.224 --> 04:15.115
and his partner Jaws
McRawlins, here in the flesh.

04:15.150 --> 04:17.091
Take it away, boys!

04:24.304 --> 04:26.004
Three bullets.

04:26.648 --> 04:28.787
One to scare him.

04:34.298 --> 04:36.804
One to calm his nerves.

04:40.715 --> 04:44.286
And one he's going to catch in his teeth!

04:45.064 --> 04:46.747
You ready, Jaws?

04:46.764 --> 04:49.109
Just let me have one last puff.

04:52.070 --> 04:53.923
Now are you ready?

04:57.073 --> 04:58.245
Nothing to worry about.

04:58.253 --> 05:00.866
They've performed this
stunt a thousand times.

05:11.568 --> 05:13.170
Oh My goodness.

05:14.368 --> 05:16.936
What was that, Murdoch, about
'nothing to worry about'?

05:17.056 --> 05:18.440
Excuse us.

05:29.197 --> 05:30.888
Jaws...

05:32.722 --> 05:35.130
It ain't like I ain't
seen a man die before.

05:35.166 --> 05:37.259
But this here was just so...

05:37.286 --> 05:38.566
Unexpected?

05:38.602 --> 05:40.006
Unexpected?

05:40.257 --> 05:43.514
Gettin' hit by lightning, that's
unexpected. No, this was...

05:44.205 --> 05:46.988
I don't understand. We travel
the world with this show.

05:47.108 --> 05:49.395
Them boys done this act
at least a thousand times.

05:49.404 --> 05:51.194
Never so much as a hitch.

05:51.314 --> 05:55.029
Were there any problems between
Mr. Wilcox and Mr. McRawlins?

05:55.149 --> 05:56.420
Problems?

05:56.885 --> 05:59.033
What are you saying? This
mighta been intentional?

05:59.153 --> 06:00.904
More than likely it was an accident.

06:01.024 --> 06:02.506
But we have to make sure. Understand?

06:02.550 --> 06:05.767
No, you understand this.
Them boyz was like brothers.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.798
They may have had their
differences now and again,

06:07.825 --> 06:09.078
but who doesn't?

06:09.198 --> 06:11.520
Naw, this is nothing
but what it looks like.

06:11.556 --> 06:14.536
Now I'm sorry, fellas,
if there's nothing further

06:14.563 --> 06:15.851
I've got a show to do tomorrow

06:15.895 --> 06:17.506
and I got a lotta changes to make.

06:17.626 --> 06:19.839
- That'll be fine, thank you.
- Thank you.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.239
The show must go on.

06:23.275 --> 06:25.566
Murdoch, this is the
greatest show on earth.

06:25.575 --> 06:28.148
- There'd be uproar if it didn't.
- I suppose.

06:28.268 --> 06:30.118
Doctor Ogden, have you found anything yet?

06:30.420 --> 06:32.521
Cursory details.

06:33.087 --> 06:35.852
The bullet knocked the
lateral incisor out cleanly.

06:35.972 --> 06:37.785
But it didn't pass through
the back of the skull.

06:37.812 --> 06:39.423
The tooth slowed the bullet's velocity

06:39.432 --> 06:41.454
significantly enough to prevent it exiting.

06:41.574 --> 06:42.537
No doubt.

06:42.555 --> 06:43.969
I won't be able to retrieve it until

06:44.005 --> 06:45.553
I perform the post-mortem.

06:47.995 --> 06:50.089
Have you found something?

06:53.740 --> 06:55.676
Wasn't so hard to retrieve after all.

06:55.879 --> 06:57.606
No.

06:59.790 --> 07:02.366
No visible striations.
Near-perfect condition.

07:02.393 --> 07:04.147
This bullet hasn't been fired.

07:04.267 --> 07:05.275
No, it hasn't.

07:05.395 --> 07:07.674
So where is the bullet that killed him?

07:08.291 --> 07:09.830
Buried in the back of his throat

07:09.866 --> 07:11.736
or perhaps lodged in his spinal column.

07:11.856 --> 07:14.859
And how did an unfired
bullet end up in his gob?

07:15.074 --> 07:18.096
It's a sleight of hand.
Isn't that right, Mr. Wilcox?

07:18.216 --> 07:20.073
Mr. McRawlins no doubt had the bullet

07:20.109 --> 07:21.746
under his tongue the whole time.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.259
Yeah, he did.

07:23.625 --> 07:25.926
I'd never fire a bullet at his head.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.530
- That'd be foolish.
- Yes, it would.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.624
So where did the bullet go?

07:30.642 --> 07:34.069
Well, after I'd fired the first two shots,

07:34.096 --> 07:35.948
put the audience on edge...

07:36.279 --> 07:39.428
Then Jaws would take a
final draw of his cigarette,

07:39.465 --> 07:41.933
like the last act of a dead man.

07:42.130 --> 07:45.960
But he was really just filling
his lungs up with smoke.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.370
I'd fire the third
bullet wide into the hay.

07:49.710 --> 07:51.481
Jaws would belch up the smoke,

07:51.508 --> 07:53.816
making like it come from
the impact of the bullet.

07:53.936 --> 07:56.858
At the same time, he'd
spit the bullet up between

07:56.876 --> 07:58.953
his teeth like he caught it.

07:59.329 --> 08:02.129
Leastways, that's what
was s'posed to happen.

08:02.765 --> 08:04.035
I see.

08:04.715 --> 08:06.174
And how would you describe

08:06.201 --> 08:08.572
your relationship with Mr. McRawlins?

08:08.608 --> 08:09.990
'Relationship'?

08:09.992 --> 08:12.041
How you two interacted.

08:12.161 --> 08:15.714
I... I know what you mean. I
just never heard it put that way.

08:15.997 --> 08:17.986
Least not by a man.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.919
And to answer your question,

08:20.039 --> 08:21.780
we got along fine.

08:22.040 --> 08:23.516
Did you?

08:23.829 --> 08:26.487
That's a helluva thing
to accuse a fella of.

08:26.728 --> 08:28.724
Please answer the question, Mr. Wilcox.

08:28.751 --> 08:30.666
I didn't shoot Jaws.

08:30.693 --> 08:33.909
- Well, someone did.
- Yeah, someone did.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.265
And whoever they are, I'll find 'em.

08:37.837 --> 08:39.342
And when I'm done,

08:39.548 --> 08:42.716
their boots will be pointing
up toward their maker.

08:42.836 --> 08:45.480
You mark my words.

08:49.480 --> 08:52.396
- Good day Mrs. Brackenreid.
- Good day, Detective.

08:52.638 --> 08:54.902
Sir, you have a moment to discuss the case?

08:55.022 --> 08:57.846
Yes, yes, but let's talk in your office.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.705
Sir, the suspect Mr. Wilcox
raises an interesting point.

09:02.732 --> 09:04.947
Someone else could have fired the shot.

09:05.067 --> 09:07.689
What would you expect
him to say: "I fired it"?

09:07.716 --> 09:10.222
Nevertheless, a theory we should entertain.

09:11.457 --> 09:12.835
I'll tell you what I think.

09:12.871 --> 09:15.286
I think it's the smartest or stupidest plan

09:15.287 --> 09:16.906
ever conceived to get away with murder.

09:17.026 --> 09:19.368
Just think... You shoot the
victim in front of a crowd

09:19.488 --> 09:22.544
and claim innocence. At worst,
it's considered an accident.

09:22.588 --> 09:24.852
Sir, why is your scotch in my desk?

09:25.255 --> 09:27.125
The missus has joined
that bloody temperance lot.

09:27.161 --> 09:28.816
She knows all my hiding places.

09:29.076 --> 09:30.069
I see.

09:30.189 --> 09:31.698
"Lips that touch alcohol

09:31.734 --> 09:33.265
shall not touch mine," she says.

09:33.385 --> 09:35.475
And she's been keeping
her word, I promise you.

09:35.595 --> 09:37.837
- Most unfortunate.
- Very.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.961
But... I promised her I'd quit,
and by god I'll give it a go.

09:42.997 --> 09:44.491
That's very commendable, Sir.

09:44.611 --> 09:45.717
However,

09:45.837 --> 09:47.891
I'm not sure I'm entirely committed.

09:50.567 --> 09:51.945
So how shall we proceed?

09:52.168 --> 09:54.638
Well, I believe the
simplest way to determine

09:54.674 --> 09:56.589
if Mr. Wilcox is in fact telling the truth

09:56.607 --> 09:59.909
is to search the hay bales
and if we do find three slugs,

09:59.927 --> 10:01.341
we know he did miss his target.

10:01.461 --> 10:02.638
And if we find two,

10:02.665 --> 10:04.267
we know where to find
the other one, don't we?

10:09.493 --> 10:11.184
Any luck finding those slugs, George?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.947
Oh, Sir, just the one so far.

10:12.983 --> 10:14.780
It's like trying to find a
needle in a haystack, literally.

10:14.806 --> 10:16.534
We thought about burning
the hay away, Sir...

10:16.551 --> 10:17.751
But thought the fire would ruin

10:17.777 --> 10:19.379
the evidentiary value of the slugs.

10:19.415 --> 10:20.453
Wise decision.

10:20.480 --> 10:21.937
Then we thought about
letting one of the bisons

10:21.938 --> 10:22.851
from the show eat the hay.

10:22.878 --> 10:24.919
But of course, we'd have to
sort through the excretion.

10:25.039 --> 10:26.798
And we just watched one excrete.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.561
Bloody hell, this is going to take awhile.

10:28.579 --> 10:31.255
Perhaps this is a good time
to enquire about motive, Sir.

10:31.711 --> 10:33.313
Bisons.

10:41.895 --> 10:43.264
Excuse me.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.314
We were told we could find Mr. Cody here.

10:45.316 --> 10:46.888
I expected him to be here now too.

10:47.008 --> 10:49.590
- He's very particular about his horse.
- And who might you be?

10:49.626 --> 10:52.606
Oh, sorry. Rude of me.
Uh, name's Teddy Jones Jr.

10:53.116 --> 10:54.377
You two are...... lawmen, ain't you?

10:54.395 --> 10:56.006
Ah, Detective William Murdoch.

10:56.024 --> 10:57.554
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid.

10:57.674 --> 10:59.487
I sure hope you find whoever shot Jaws.

10:59.607 --> 11:02.513
Oh, what makes you think
it wasn't Mr. Wilcox?

11:02.633 --> 11:06.046
Well, I may have only been
working here for a few months,

11:06.592 --> 11:08.821
but I know Lightning would
never do that to his pal.

11:08.941 --> 11:11.365
Stranger things have happened
than two men falling out, son.

11:11.392 --> 11:13.003
There's a code, Sir.

11:13.123 --> 11:14.909
You don't double-cross your partner.

11:15.029 --> 11:17.781
You got that coat looking pretty
good there, young Theodore.

11:17.901 --> 11:21.164
- Shiny as a new dime, Sir.
- Shiny as a new dime, huh?

11:23.205 --> 11:24.959
Pretty nice work there, son.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.097
Why don't you go get
yourself a sarsaparilla

11:27.106 --> 11:29.334
- and tell them it's on me?
- Thank you very much, Sir.

11:29.361 --> 11:30.775
Gentlemen.

11:30.895 --> 11:32.215
Ain't he a beauty?

11:32.716 --> 11:35.491
- It's a fine animal, Sir.
- Yes Sir, he sure is.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.715
- D'you ever ride?
- I'm strictly an infantryman myself.

11:38.835 --> 11:40.773
I did a bit of time as a ranch hand.

11:40.893 --> 11:42.241
Well then,

11:42.545 --> 11:44.317
you know there's no place I'd rather be

11:44.353 --> 11:46.545
than on the back of this horse
skipping across them plains.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.406
I wish I was back in them days. But,

11:48.961 --> 11:51.028
guess them days is gone, huh?

11:51.332 --> 11:53.292
So what can I do for you two?

11:53.336 --> 11:56.186
We'd like to make a few enquiries
about Mr. Wilcox and Mr. McRawlins.

11:56.195 --> 11:58.173
You still thinking that
weren't an accident?

11:58.181 --> 12:00.553
We're treating it as suspicious.

12:01.483 --> 12:03.292
Could I offer a suggestion?

12:03.301 --> 12:04.473
Of course.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.066
Start with the headliners.

12:06.186 --> 12:07.202
They've been here the longest.

12:07.247 --> 12:09.502
Anybody knows anything about them two guys,

12:09.726 --> 12:11.641
it would be one of the headliners.

12:11.909 --> 12:14.630
Come on you shiney new dime, let's go.

12:19.731 --> 12:21.834
I didn't really know him.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.100
It's my understanding that
you've been travelling together

12:25.136 --> 12:26.487
for some time now.

12:27.149 --> 12:29.483
- I keep to myself.
- I see.

12:29.603 --> 12:31.174
Any particular reason?

12:31.577 --> 12:32.731
Nope.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.762
A man of few words.

12:35.398 --> 12:36.463
Yep.

12:37.008 --> 12:39.477
Mr. Warton, do you know of
any reason that Mr. Wilcox

12:39.504 --> 12:42.028
might have had to kill Jaws?

12:42.350 --> 12:43.602
Nope.

12:45.016 --> 12:47.861
If you could spare just a
few more words, Mr. Warton,

12:47.888 --> 12:49.347
it might help expedite matters.

12:50.018 --> 12:53.620
Just because I don't know a reason
why Wilcox might have killed Jaws

12:54.375 --> 12:56.406
doesn't mean he didn't have one.

12:57.958 --> 12:59.977
A lot of things happened out west.

13:00.791 --> 13:02.715
Things better left forgotten.

13:03.324 --> 13:06.599
So they coulda had their
reasons but they weren't telling.

13:07.377 --> 13:09.865
And I didn't ask.

13:18.519 --> 13:20.979
That's pretty impressive
shooting there, Miss Oakley.

13:21.099 --> 13:23.278
I'm just getting started there, Inspector.

13:24.093 --> 13:25.780
Would you hold this for me?

13:25.782 --> 13:27.592
Of course.

13:27.971 --> 13:31.112
Miss Oakley. About Mr.
Wilcox and Mr. McRawlins...

13:31.345 --> 13:33.520
I didn't have too much to do with them.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.184
They weren't the

13:35.304 --> 13:38.141
swiftest dogies in the herd,
if you catch my meaning.

13:38.772 --> 13:40.427
I think so.

13:40.991 --> 13:43.363
Miss Oakley, would I be
right in assuming that

13:43.483 --> 13:46.163
you're going to shoot at this
card while I hold it like this?

13:46.190 --> 13:47.685
- No.
- Oh good.

13:47.703 --> 13:50.029
Turn it sideways. I like a challenge.

13:53.007 --> 13:54.844
Now, Inspector, you're shaking.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.304
- Don't you trust me?
- Course I do.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.543
- Oh bloody hell! Hooo!
- Now you're shaking even more!

14:01.375 --> 14:03.675
Perhaps a drink would steady your nerves.

14:04.265 --> 14:05.732
I'm on duty.

14:05.759 --> 14:07.334
- You sure?
- Quite.

14:07.844 --> 14:09.419
Suit yourself.

14:09.539 --> 14:12.158
Did you ever see any bad blood
between the two gentlemen?

14:13.169 --> 14:14.404
No.

14:14.753 --> 14:16.596
Sorry I can't be more help.

14:17.178 --> 14:20.072
That's all for now. If...
if you remember anything...

14:20.192 --> 14:21.871
I like your accent, copper.

14:22.187 --> 14:23.437
It's queer.

14:23.557 --> 14:24.833
Funny-like.

14:25.191 --> 14:27.544
Well, ta very much.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.677
You, uh... need any more
help, you just stop on by.

14:30.797 --> 14:33.433
There'll be a drink waiting
for you if you change your mind.

14:35.455 --> 14:37.266
I'll be sure to remember that.

14:41.468 --> 14:43.893
And you found nothing out
of the ordinary at the show?

14:43.902 --> 14:47.322
Oh, on the contrary. Everything
about the show is extraordinary.

14:47.358 --> 14:50.357
Well, that's what makes the Buffalo
Bill show so compelling, isn't it?

14:50.383 --> 14:51.797
All the mystery and adventure.

14:51.824 --> 14:53.183
Yes, well, for the audience.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.938
But I need to know the truth.

14:55.058 --> 14:57.444
Right. Well, you're in luck.

14:57.435 --> 14:59.305
I have some very real and
interesting findings for you.

14:59.341 --> 15:00.746
A slug, I presume.

15:00.866 --> 15:03.252
Well, the bullet that killed Mr. McRawlins

15:03.261 --> 15:05.051
had indeed lodged in his spine.

15:05.077 --> 15:07.803
And as I was retrieving
it, I discovered that

15:07.923 --> 15:10.494
he has only one real tooth in his head.

15:11.022 --> 15:12.463
All the others were false?

15:12.490 --> 15:14.494
Not just... false. Gold.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.161
Crowns, filling, flake, you name it.

15:17.281 --> 15:18.682
That's rather fancy for a man earning

15:18.700 --> 15:20.006
only forty dollars a week.

15:20.033 --> 15:21.465
My sentiments exactly.

15:21.483 --> 15:23.575
However, there was something even more

15:23.577 --> 15:25.544
curious about the slug I found.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.243
A hollow-point.

15:30.833 --> 15:33.715
More commonly found in a
rifle than a six shooter.

15:33.835 --> 15:35.406
Precisely.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.630
Ah, Sir.

15:39.880 --> 15:42.141
- We found the second slug.
- And...

15:42.261 --> 15:44.829
here's the third.

15:44.831 --> 15:46.064
You're good luck, Sir.

15:46.091 --> 15:48.291
This means that Wilcox didn't shoot Jaws.

15:48.411 --> 15:50.394
Yes, I already knew that.

15:50.949 --> 15:53.847
- So you didn't need this?
- After all. That's correct.

15:53.882 --> 15:56.656
The victim was shot with
a rifle, not a handgun.

15:56.701 --> 15:59.949
So I need to determine where
that shot was fired from.

15:59.976 --> 16:03.190
Constable Higgins, can you stand
where the victim was standing?

16:03.592 --> 16:06.983
George. Can you stand
where Wilcox fired from?

16:19.632 --> 16:22.317
One to scare him.

16:22.675 --> 16:25.270
One to calm his nerves.

16:29.100 --> 16:32.733
And one he's going to catch in his teeth!

16:34.755 --> 16:36.420
Here.

16:36.984 --> 16:39.990
Killer stood here and steadied his aim,

16:40.110 --> 16:42.916
then fired at the exact instant Wilcox did.

16:43.131 --> 16:44.706
From here, Sir? That...

16:44.742 --> 16:46.254
that must be a good fifty yards.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.614
And to shoot a man's tooth
out from that distance,

16:48.734 --> 16:50.896
the gunman was either very lucky or...

16:50.931 --> 16:52.239
Or a very good shot!

16:52.257 --> 16:53.483
And unfortunately,

16:53.603 --> 16:56.427
we have an abundance of qualified killers.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.582
So the shot was fired from here

17:02.583 --> 17:05.195
and the killer slips away without
leaving so much as a trace.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.442
He slipped away, but
clearly he left a trace.

17:07.561 --> 17:09.026
It was a figure of speech, Murdoch.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.550
You've told me about traces
of evidence many times.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.431
"Any place the killer came in contact with

17:14.467 --> 17:17.733
will yield evidence, no matter how slight."

17:18.878 --> 17:20.642
Is that me, Sir?

17:20.762 --> 17:22.502
But look around; it could be anything.

17:22.530 --> 17:23.944
Actually, no Sir, it can't.

17:24.064 --> 17:25.830
Sir, your murder bag.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.218
Thank you, George.

17:28.328 --> 17:30.440
You see, the problem is
there's too much evidence.

17:30.484 --> 17:32.838
We don't need all of it,
so we need only collect

17:32.874 --> 17:35.835
what we need. George, a
sheet of wax paper please.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.553
And how do you propose to do that?

17:37.580 --> 17:38.394
Glue.

17:38.421 --> 17:39.960
- Glue, Sir?
- Yes.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.367
Since the killer was
here only a few hours ago,

17:42.376 --> 17:45.007
we need to collect only
what was left most recently,

17:45.043 --> 17:47.816
whether it be dust, air, particles.

17:52.514 --> 17:55.395
George, make careful note
of each sheet of paper

17:55.431 --> 17:56.719
and its corresponding surface.

17:56.839 --> 17:57.748
Sir.

17:57.749 --> 17:59.754
Well, it's ingenious. I'll give you that.

17:59.781 --> 18:01.400
If a tad complicated.

18:01.445 --> 18:03.834
I do have a simpler approach
in mind as well, Sir.

18:05.771 --> 18:08.580
All right, boys bring your
wives, bring your sweethearts.

18:08.607 --> 18:10.487
Hell, you can bring your
wife and your sweetheart,

18:10.504 --> 18:12.875
because you are not going
to believe your eyes.

18:12.893 --> 18:15.873
I guarantee you are going
to see some amazing things.

18:15.993 --> 18:19.282
- Sir, Sir, um, Mr. Bill...
- Bill, just Bill...

18:19.326 --> 18:20.874
Mr. Bill, Sir, uh, could I
have your autograph, please?

18:20.919 --> 18:22.575
- The name's Higgins, Sir.
- Higgins?

18:22.611 --> 18:24.320
- Yeah, yes, please.
- To Sheriff Higgins.

18:24.866 --> 18:27.801
- Gosh, maybe one day, Sir.
- Oy! You lot!

18:27.921 --> 18:30.477
Get back to work, you bunch
of brown-nosing layabouts!

18:30.495 --> 18:32.533
- Here you go, Mr. Higgins.
- Thank you, Sir.

18:32.556 --> 18:35.760
- It's a pleasure.
- Mr. Cody, please join me in my office.

18:35.805 --> 18:38.248
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid duty calls.

18:38.686 --> 18:40.378
See ya at the show.

18:45.237 --> 18:47.962
Yep, this here is some
nasty business, ain't it?

18:48.082 --> 18:49.841
And I know what you're thinking.

18:49.961 --> 18:52.230
- You do?
- Buffalo Bill,

18:52.776 --> 18:56.123
he's seen things that you
just can't even imagine...

18:56.243 --> 18:59.282
- Actually, Sir...
- Been around the world and then back again.

18:59.917 --> 19:02.074
But let me tell ya, it all means nothing

19:02.101 --> 19:04.686
when it comes down to losing
one of your best hands.

19:04.722 --> 19:07.283
Sir, where were you when Jaws was shot?

19:07.285 --> 19:08.718
Where was I?

19:08.720 --> 19:10.002
Wha... what are you suggesting?

19:10.122 --> 19:13.171
Jaws McRawlins was not
shot by Lightning Wilcox.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.398
In fact, the shot came from almost directly

19:15.389 --> 19:18.429
behind Wilcox at a distance
of approximately fifty yards.

19:18.549 --> 19:19.879
Fifty yards?

19:19.897 --> 19:23.002
Yes. So whoever fired the
shot would've been very good.

19:23.029 --> 19:24.765
Now I'm assuming you are the best marksman

19:24.783 --> 19:26.054
in your show, are you not?

19:26.287 --> 19:28.717
- Well, I don't know about that.
- Come, come Mr. Cody.

19:28.837 --> 19:33.455
You reputedly shot some 4280
buffalo in a single season.

19:33.575 --> 19:34.968
If that were true,

19:34.985 --> 19:36.498
it would have more to do with stamina

19:36.507 --> 19:38.413
than it would have to do with skill.

19:38.646 --> 19:40.847
Them bison is a docile bunch.

19:40.967 --> 19:44.083
Don't get me wrong. I was
a crack shot in my day.

19:44.325 --> 19:47.421
But them days is gone. My
eyesight just ain't what it was.

19:47.466 --> 19:49.748
- So you're saying you couldn't have done it.
- Not hardly.

19:50.915 --> 19:52.343
Well, then who?

19:53.489 --> 19:54.935
Well, Sir,

19:55.234 --> 19:57.641
there's only two guns in my show

19:57.838 --> 20:00.925
- that could pull off a shot like that.
- And they are?

20:01.480 --> 20:03.923
Well, one would be John Warton.

20:05.274 --> 20:07.878
- And the other would be, uh...
- Annie Oakley?!

20:07.998 --> 20:10.160
What reason would she have to kill?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.654
Mr. Cody wasn't sure,

20:11.681 --> 20:13.668
but he had heard rumours of
bad blood between the two.

20:13.999 --> 20:15.923
Funny he didn't mention that earlier.

20:16.043 --> 20:18.214
Apparently his memory is
as bad as his eyesight.

20:18.334 --> 20:20.865
Protecting the reputation of
his show that's what he's doing.

20:20.901 --> 20:22.136
That's to be expected.

20:22.256 --> 20:25.253
Bloody carnies. Trouble.
That's what they are.

20:26.774 --> 20:29.589
I've established a... a
rapport with Miss Oakley, so

20:29.606 --> 20:30.993
let me call on her.

20:31.378 --> 20:34.296
Right. I'll speak with Mr. Warton.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.894
Mr. Warton?

20:39.503 --> 20:40.930
I'm ponderin'

20:41.740 --> 20:43.665
Pondering?

20:44.746 --> 20:47.968
All the different ways I know
to have killed Jaws McRawlins,

20:47.986 --> 20:50.133
had I put my mind to it.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.308
And?

20:56.245 --> 20:58.313
That's the weapon I'da used.

21:01.266 --> 21:04.174
Check the bullets against
the one you dug outta Jaws.

21:04.577 --> 21:07.088
And I'm to believe you have only one rifle?

21:07.090 --> 21:08.819
If I had wanted him dead,

21:09.176 --> 21:11.028
I wouldn't have waited to do it in front

21:11.055 --> 21:13.435
of a packed house and
a half a dozen lawmen.

21:14.931 --> 21:17.695
I understand the two of you had words.

21:17.891 --> 21:21.292
Probably very few words,
but words nonetheless.

21:21.412 --> 21:24.289
- He needed a talking-to.
- Why?

21:25.775 --> 21:29.094
Because he was getting a
bit too big for his britches.

21:29.214 --> 21:31.018
Don't you mean that he and Wilcox

21:31.044 --> 21:32.646
had supplanted you in the show?

21:32.673 --> 21:33.979
Something that would have cost you roughly

21:34.015 --> 21:35.939
twenty-five dollars a week in salary.

21:37.425 --> 21:39.743
"Pride goeth before destruction,

21:40.083 --> 21:42.562
and a haughty spirit before a fall."

21:42.875 --> 21:44.996
Proverbs 16:18.

21:45.479 --> 21:48.110
Jaws was gloating, rubbing it in?

21:48.414 --> 21:49.631
He was.

21:51.450 --> 21:54.052
But I don't abide anyone
disrespecting a lady.

21:54.589 --> 21:56.477
So I had a little chat with him.

21:58.195 --> 21:59.904
That's all?

22:01.255 --> 22:02.544
That's all.

22:04.674 --> 22:06.410
And this lady who might she be?

22:06.454 --> 22:08.280
BANG!

22:09.067 --> 22:10.624
Jaws...

22:11.430 --> 22:14.732
certainly did have a bad
case of wandering hands.

22:14.852 --> 22:17.641
But as you may have guessed,
I can take of myself.

22:17.909 --> 22:21.127
Sure didn't need John Warton
gettin' all chivalrous.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.684
Now you sure I can't tempt you?

22:27.874 --> 22:30.603
Hundred percent Kentucky
mash, smooth as silk.

22:30.836 --> 22:33.297
I'm still on duty, Miss Oakley.

22:33.417 --> 22:34.997
Suit yourself.

22:35.117 --> 22:37.207
So you confronted Mr. McRawlins?

22:37.243 --> 22:38.405
Well, if putting my boot

22:38.406 --> 22:40.850
up his backside is
considered a confrontation...

22:42.621 --> 22:45.530
He never so much as looked
sideways at me again.

22:46.013 --> 22:47.140
I see.

22:47.346 --> 22:50.031
- Miss Oakley.
- Inspector.

22:50.966 --> 22:53.440
I have to ask you where you
were when the shot was fired.

22:53.441 --> 22:55.061
Why, I was in my tent.

22:55.329 --> 22:56.529
Alone.

22:57.755 --> 22:59.517
But I didn't shoot Jaws.

22:59.884 --> 23:03.661
Oh, if I'da shot him, I'da
aimed a lot lower than his teeth.

23:12.600 --> 23:14.700
Two world-class marksmen.

23:14.702 --> 23:17.136
Three, if you include Buffalo Bill.

23:17.138 --> 23:20.063
Each with motive, and
none with a decent alibi.

23:20.089 --> 23:21.611
So what's our next move?

23:21.731 --> 23:23.588
I'll do some ballistics work

23:23.615 --> 23:26.049
comparing their rifles to the
slug that killed the victim.

23:26.085 --> 23:28.376
I think they're too cagey a
lot to be tripped up like that.

23:28.420 --> 23:30.415
There's no shortage of rifles to check.

23:30.460 --> 23:32.035
We're going to need another clue, Murdoch.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.529
Well then, Inspector.

23:33.547 --> 23:35.891
I believe I may have
what you're looking for.

23:36.312 --> 23:39.122
- It's most disconcerting.
- Disconcerting?

23:39.140 --> 23:41.770
The audacity... to walk into my morgue

23:41.890 --> 23:43.238
and to take such liberties!

23:43.265 --> 23:45.663
I must say, I feel absolutely violated!

23:45.783 --> 23:47.828
Dr. Ogden, what on earth has happened?

23:47.948 --> 23:51.017
- It's Mr. McRawlins' head.
- What about it?

23:53.358 --> 23:54.995
It's gone.

23:57.850 --> 23:59.882
His head... just sliced off?

23:59.909 --> 24:01.099
Sawed off actually.

24:01.143 --> 24:03.264
Whoever it was left the
bone saw in the sink.

24:03.282 --> 24:05.036
Well, that was obliging of him.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.951
Probably after that mouth full of gold.

24:06.960 --> 24:08.302
Probably worth a few sheckles.

24:08.311 --> 24:10.378
Yes, but why take the whole head?

24:11.434 --> 24:14.406
Unless it too was of value.

24:22.066 --> 24:24.786
You think Jaws McRawlins
had a bounty on him?

24:24.813 --> 24:26.424
Someone removed his head, Mr. Cody.

24:26.433 --> 24:27.131
I can't help but think

24:27.167 --> 24:28.769
that it's because there was a price on it.

24:28.796 --> 24:30.558
Was there a bounty on Jaws McRawlins?

24:30.603 --> 24:32.984
Well, everybody in this
show has some kinda history.

24:33.011 --> 24:34.461
Not all of it's wholesome.

24:34.505 --> 24:36.349
It's my understanding
that removal of the head

24:36.358 --> 24:38.657
- is the bounty hunter's hallmark.
- Yes, it is.

24:38.666 --> 24:40.913
And how many bounty hunters
do you have in the show?

24:41.128 --> 24:43.159
Just got the one, John Warton.

24:43.279 --> 24:44.492
Yep.

24:50.335 --> 24:52.715
I'm starting to think we'd be
better off if we were armed.

24:52.921 --> 24:56.026
Given Mr. Warton's talents,
Sir, I'm sure it wouldn't help.

24:56.402 --> 24:58.165
Warton?!

25:01.216 --> 25:02.764
Bloody hell. He's skedaddled.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.847
- Pardon?
- Gone.

25:05.252 --> 25:06.344
Teddy!

25:06.389 --> 25:08.008
Have you seen Mr. Warton?

25:08.128 --> 25:11.174
Sure did, Detective. Uh, he ran
right past me, carrying his bag.

25:11.294 --> 25:12.346
Fact, there he is now.

25:12.364 --> 25:14.531
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- John Warton!

25:15.810 --> 25:17.404
Stop!

25:39.060 --> 25:40.197
Murdoch,

25:40.317 --> 25:42.953
you're just one surprise
after another, me old mucker.

25:45.530 --> 25:47.982
He killed a card cheat in Kansas City.

25:48.778 --> 25:51.024
He was worth two thousand dollars.

25:51.605 --> 25:53.825
A thousand dollars in
Kansas City, Kansas...

25:53.851 --> 25:56.563
And a thousand dollars in
Kansas City, Missouri, yes,

25:56.599 --> 25:59.256
but you're not in Kansas
City anymore, Mr. Warton.

25:59.650 --> 26:02.264
You can't just come to this
country and shoot a man.

26:02.384 --> 26:04.501
No matter what the bounty is on his head.

26:04.621 --> 26:06.023
I didn't shoot him.

26:06.345 --> 26:07.991
I was just collecting the bounty.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.229
You knew who he was all along.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.302
I seen his rat-face on a hundred posters.

26:14.121 --> 26:16.627
Gold choppers didn't fool me none.

26:16.747 --> 26:18.810
I knew it was One-Tooth Ackerson.

26:19.007 --> 26:20.576
I'm sorry, "One-Tooth"...

26:20.578 --> 26:22.005
Ackerson.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.029
Lost his teeth in a bar fight in Cheyenne.

26:25.483 --> 26:26.998
Am I to believe that you travelled

26:27.016 --> 26:28.529
with this man for years

26:28.556 --> 26:31.705
and never tried to collect the
price on his head until now?

26:32.430 --> 26:34.533
You think I'm just going
to throw him into a sack

26:34.560 --> 26:36.654
and cart him off to Kansas
kicking and screaming?

26:36.774 --> 26:38.615
He was wanted dead or alive.

26:42.946 --> 26:44.933
You ever killed a man, Detective?

26:46.902 --> 26:48.476
I have.

26:49.084 --> 26:51.169
More times than I care to count.

26:52.413 --> 26:54.105
They say it gets easier with time,

26:54.132 --> 26:56.333
but that wasn't my experience.

26:57.469 --> 26:59.465
I put those days behind me.

26:59.805 --> 27:01.595
Why should I believe you?

27:02.695 --> 27:06.043
I'm not above turning a dead
man in for a thousand dollars.

27:06.482 --> 27:08.558
I'm not above stealing his gold teeth.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.509
But I didn't kill One-Tooth.

27:10.939 --> 27:12.496
That's my word.

27:14.554 --> 27:16.460
One-Tooth, you say?

27:16.827 --> 27:19.485
I heard tell of a One-Eyed Ackerson.

27:20.040 --> 27:22.930
You had no idea who
your partner really was?

27:22.966 --> 27:24.150
None.

27:24.152 --> 27:25.968
I find that hard to believe.

27:25.973 --> 27:29.301
He pulled the wool over my eyes real good.

27:29.421 --> 27:30.733
Corker, ain't it?

27:31.905 --> 27:33.359
Mr. Wilcox.

27:34.384 --> 27:36.662
How many men have you killed?

27:36.664 --> 27:38.297
Countin' Indians?

27:38.796 --> 27:40.362
Beats me.

27:40.482 --> 27:43.609
Somewhere between plenty
and too many, I guess.

27:44.005 --> 27:46.151
What's one more, eh?

27:46.447 --> 27:48.783
You still think I killed Jaws?

27:49.042 --> 27:51.664
I thought I was the one
guy that couldna done it.

27:51.888 --> 27:54.044
You could have had an accomplice.

27:54.164 --> 27:56.621
A man don't turn on his partner, Detective.

27:58.634 --> 28:00.057
Mr. Wilcox.

28:00.177 --> 28:01.838
There is another way of looking at this.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.335
Yeah, and how's that?

28:04.576 --> 28:06.849
One-Tooth's past caught up to him.

28:06.969 --> 28:08.505
Yours could also.

28:08.970 --> 28:12.298
Perhaps you should be looking
over your shoulder, Mr. Wilcox.

28:12.504 --> 28:14.303
Am I free to go now?

28:14.956 --> 28:18.312
So you believe Warton was just
capitalizing on opportunity?

28:18.432 --> 28:20.012
I'm inclined to, yes.

28:20.254 --> 28:21.909
And his partner?

28:22.029 --> 28:24.675
I'm sure he knew Jaws
was really One-Tooth,

28:24.701 --> 28:25.963
but I don't think he killed him.

28:26.083 --> 28:27.762
Bunch of cutthroats, the lot of them.

28:27.882 --> 28:30.035
I'm surprised no one sawed
off his head even earlier.

28:30.464 --> 28:31.760
So what's our plan?

28:32.388 --> 28:34.160
Clearly, someone else in Buffalo Bill's

28:34.178 --> 28:35.998
show knew of One-Tooth's secret.

28:36.000 --> 28:39.144
And whoever that person was
was also an excellent shot.

28:42.750 --> 28:46.589
So Jaws McRawlins was ol'
One-Tooth, ol' One-Tooth Ackerson?

28:46.634 --> 28:47.691
You didn't know?

28:47.717 --> 28:49.086
Well, I had my suspicions.

28:49.122 --> 28:51.789
After all, the man just
had the one real tooth.

28:51.816 --> 28:53.874
But that's in the past, and a man's past,

28:53.994 --> 28:55.458
that's his business.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.599
That's becoming a tiresome
refrain around here.

28:58.599 --> 28:59.878
It's the way of the west.

28:59.923 --> 29:02.635
Sir, the west is dead and gone.

29:02.679 --> 29:05.757
There's nothing left of
it now but a carnival show.

29:07.323 --> 29:09.237
Uh, Mr. Cody, I believe

29:09.255 --> 29:10.866
that man is trying to get your attention.

29:10.884 --> 29:12.271
What man?

29:12.468 --> 29:14.454
He's holding up a message for you?

29:15.886 --> 29:19.107
How does that idiot
expect me to read something

29:19.394 --> 29:21.908
from that kind of distance to here?

29:22.028 --> 29:24.226
"I am fifty yards

29:24.754 --> 29:26.293
from the spot where

29:26.338 --> 29:28.414
Jaws McRawlins was shot."

29:28.942 --> 29:30.875
Oh, I get this.

29:31.841 --> 29:34.741
You were testin' ol'
Buffalo Bill, weren't you?

29:34.861 --> 29:37.452
You told me your eyesight
wasn't up to making the shot.

29:37.470 --> 29:39.071
And you thought I was lying?

29:39.191 --> 29:40.700
With all due respect, Mr. Cody,

29:40.709 --> 29:42.347
you've built a whole show around lies.

29:42.374 --> 29:44.665
People don't want the truth.

29:45.327 --> 29:47.215
No, Sir, they want something else.

29:47.233 --> 29:48.414
They want a good story.

29:48.459 --> 29:50.642
And a good story told often enough,

29:50.762 --> 29:52.199
that can become the truth.

29:52.235 --> 29:54.986
Like the story of Jaws
McRawlins and Lightning Wilcox?

29:55.004 --> 29:55.980
Well,

29:56.275 --> 29:58.235
I may have embellished that a little bit.

29:58.271 --> 30:00.114
I'd settle for the truth.

30:00.234 --> 30:02.235
All right, all right.

30:03.568 --> 30:05.635
Chester McGee weren't no killer.

30:05.755 --> 30:07.272
But he was a troublemaker.

30:07.299 --> 30:09.456
He caused a lot of
problems for the railroads.

30:09.576 --> 30:13.733
So they deputized Hank
and Jaws to deal with him.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.329
- You mean kill him.
- No. Deal with him,

30:16.347 --> 30:19.184
- one way or t'other.
- Let me guess,

30:19.193 --> 30:20.945
they didn't turn their back on him.

30:20.947 --> 30:22.683
Only a fool would do that.

30:22.907 --> 30:24.929
But they did kick that gun over.

30:25.049 --> 30:26.800
They did give him a fair fight.

30:26.920 --> 30:30.201
Or gave themselves a reason to shoot him.

30:30.397 --> 30:33.546
Well, nobody made Chester pick up that gun.

30:37.153 --> 30:38.549
One-Tooth?

30:38.669 --> 30:41.162
I never would have guessed
that in a million years.

30:41.282 --> 30:42.504
Why's that?

30:42.624 --> 30:43.641
The way I heard it,

30:43.677 --> 30:46.343
One-Tooth could freeze a
man's blood with his grin.

30:46.463 --> 30:47.355
That sure as shootin'

30:47.390 --> 30:49.824
wouldn't have been my
description of Jaws McRawlins.

30:50.039 --> 30:52.688
Another tall tale from the west, I suppose.

30:52.808 --> 30:54.424
Still, there was his bounty.

30:54.451 --> 30:57.064
- That must have interested you.
- Two thousand dollars?

30:57.616 --> 31:00.005
Ain't nothing to spit at.
But I don't need the money.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.188
Not bad enough to shoot a man over.

31:03.789 --> 31:05.070
Then who did?

31:05.338 --> 31:06.636
Well, you throw a stone around here,

31:06.645 --> 31:09.132
you'd hit somebody
willing to kill him for it.

31:09.705 --> 31:12.748
Now Inspector, are you
ready for that drink?

31:13.428 --> 31:14.905
No, thank you.

31:15.025 --> 31:17.054
What sort of lawman doesn't drink?

31:17.299 --> 31:19.393
- Well, I...
- You're not a religious man, are you?

31:19.513 --> 31:21.613
- No, no, well, I attend, but...
- You fruity?

31:21.639 --> 31:22.758
No, of course not.

31:22.785 --> 31:24.288
Well then, why are you on the wagon?

31:24.315 --> 31:27.134
I ain't never met a copper
didn't enjoy a swaller.

31:32.539 --> 31:33.890
Truth is,

31:34.010 --> 31:36.172
my wife has joined the Temperance League.

31:36.292 --> 31:38.928
Oh. Temperance League.

31:39.903 --> 31:41.577
Right.

31:41.836 --> 31:43.178
No, I couldn't.

31:43.205 --> 31:46.713
What your wife don't know
won't hurt her, will it?

31:47.384 --> 31:48.923
Well...

31:49.621 --> 31:52.404
One little drink won't
do any harm, I suppose.

32:00.743 --> 32:04.010
Take that, you bunch
of Temperance bastards!

32:11.177 --> 32:12.922
They'd never let me do
this back in England.

32:12.922 --> 32:14.998
It looks good in your hands.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.377
Oh, wait wait wait, Sherlock,
you're holding it wrong.

32:38.497 --> 32:40.757
All right. Now...

32:41.607 --> 32:43.656
now that's better.

32:52.256 --> 32:56.766
- Just relax.
- I'm trying, darling, I'm trying.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.084
Who's there?

33:08.632 --> 33:11.173
What do you want, friend?

33:21.947 --> 33:24.506
Mr. Wilcox died of massive
internal hemorrhaging

33:24.542 --> 33:26.528
caused by a single gunshot wound.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.622
There were no powder marks.

33:29.132 --> 33:32.156
So the killer was some
distance away from his victim?

33:32.441 --> 33:35.860
What's odd is the bullet's path?

33:35.878 --> 33:36.979
Oh? How so?

33:37.006 --> 33:39.502
Well, it entered just
above the left clavicle,

33:39.547 --> 33:40.782
pierced the deltoid muscle,

33:40.790 --> 33:42.303
then shattered the scapula

33:42.312 --> 33:44.298
before heading deeper toward the heart.

33:44.418 --> 33:46.142
As if the shot was fired from above

33:46.187 --> 33:48.245
and then travelled down
the length of the body.

33:48.365 --> 33:50.599
Are you suggesting the killer was overhead?

33:50.719 --> 33:52.595
That seems unlikely.

34:07.050 --> 34:09.255
The killer wasn't overhead.

34:10.357 --> 34:12.379
The victim was bent forward.

34:12.987 --> 34:15.940
Well, that would be consistent
with the bullet's angle of entry.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.525
But what was he doing bent over?

34:18.646 --> 34:20.754
A very good question, Doctor.

34:22.016 --> 34:24.079
That's the only bullet casing we found.

34:24.199 --> 34:25.667
45 calibre, I believe.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.438
A handgun.

34:27.716 --> 34:30.239
So the killer stood here

34:31.063 --> 34:34.159
and deliberately emptied
the chamber of his gun.

34:34.553 --> 34:37.077
Just like a wild west shootout.

34:37.585 --> 34:39.938
What do we have here?

34:40.476 --> 34:42.436
It appears to be a skid mark.

34:46.152 --> 34:47.483
We're interviewing the show's crew

34:47.509 --> 34:49.407
but nobody seems to have seen anything.

34:49.451 --> 34:51.025
- No one?
- No.

34:51.062 --> 34:53.299
However, shots were heard.

34:53.418 --> 34:54.909
Shots?

34:55.938 --> 34:59.134
But the victim was shot once
and we only found one casing.

34:59.254 --> 35:00.798
Yes, but there were numerous shots heard

35:00.825 --> 35:02.221
in the vicinity of Miss Oakley's tent.

35:02.247 --> 35:04.350
However, we believe it
was just some drunken lout

35:04.377 --> 35:06.316
- who got his hands on a rifle.
- I see.

35:06.835 --> 35:08.983
The marks stop here.

35:09.591 --> 35:11.811
The victim was bent over.

35:12.491 --> 35:14.290
Why?

35:20.822 --> 35:22.316
A gun.

35:22.436 --> 35:24.249
He bent down to pick up a gun.

35:25.824 --> 35:27.784
So the killer enters,

35:28.222 --> 35:32.616
Wilcox drops his gun,
bends over to pick it up?

35:37.770 --> 35:41.033
The killer kicked over a gun.

35:41.761 --> 35:44.756
- Well, that sounds familiar.
- Doesn't it?

35:47.378 --> 35:50.075
- Mrs. Brackenreid, always a pleasure.
-  Detective Murdoch.

35:50.077 --> 35:51.557
I just want to say how terribly,

35:51.593 --> 35:53.261
terribly disappointed I am in you.

35:53.284 --> 35:55.306
- Me?
- Those liquor bottles in your office.

35:55.351 --> 35:58.599
- Ah, but...
- Leading Thomas into temptation like that.

35:59.548 --> 36:01.087
I'm very sorry.

36:01.114 --> 36:03.364
And he's trying so hard to be good.

36:03.583 --> 36:05.767
Yes, he is.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.376
Murdoch, what is it?

36:18.496 --> 36:20.265
I've just received this.

36:20.551 --> 36:22.367
Just... just read it.

36:22.967 --> 36:26.975
It's a telegram from the Marshal
in Rio Grande confirming...

36:26.993 --> 36:28.988
Shhh. Shhh.

36:30.214 --> 36:34.034
Confirming a suspicion I
had about Lightning Wilcox.

36:34.339 --> 36:36.836
His real name is Harry 'The Gun' Bowler,

36:36.881 --> 36:38.930
partner of One-Tooth Ackerson.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.612
Two dead gunmen.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.786
It would seem their pasts
are coming back to haunt them.

36:42.906 --> 36:44.334
Yeah, but which part of it?

36:44.352 --> 36:46.240
They did a lot of bad things in their day.

36:46.249 --> 36:48.631
I suspect it has something to
do with killing Chester McGee.

36:48.751 --> 36:51.513
Just another one of Buffalo Bill's legends.

36:51.987 --> 36:54.189
Every myth has a basis in reality.

36:54.309 --> 36:55.612
True enough.

36:55.732 --> 36:57.517
I suggest we contact Carson City

36:57.535 --> 36:59.388
where the event allegedly took place.

36:59.683 --> 37:02.126
I'll get the desk sergeant
to send a telegram.

37:02.878 --> 37:04.972
Right then.

37:09.387 --> 37:11.862
It's my understanding that
there was a lot of nasty

37:11.871 --> 37:14.072
business associated with the railroads.

37:14.398 --> 37:17.499
What makes you think I'd
know anything about that?

37:17.501 --> 37:19.343
Gun for hire, were you not?

37:20.506 --> 37:23.004
Might know a thing or two, I suppose.

37:23.006 --> 37:24.488
Such as?

37:24.608 --> 37:26.403
Sometimes there was trouble.

37:27.754 --> 37:30.941
People didn't take kindly to track
getting laid through their land.

37:31.210 --> 37:33.357
People like Chester McGee.

37:35.335 --> 37:37.133
If there was a fuss,

37:37.482 --> 37:39.164
the railroad would...

37:40.596 --> 37:44.408
mount an appropriate response.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.522
Like hiring One-Tooth
Ackerson and Harry Bowler?

37:47.642 --> 37:50.985
Or some other saddle
tramp without a conscience.

37:51.021 --> 37:54.967
And they would convince
the landowner to sell?

37:55.960 --> 37:57.526
Like I said,

37:59.075 --> 38:02.421
they mount an appropriate response.

38:12.713 --> 38:14.911
Ah, Sir, I'm glad you're here.

38:14.913 --> 38:17.258
I've amassed all the trace evidence

38:17.378 --> 38:18.601
from the two crime scenes.

38:18.645 --> 38:21.301
Yes, I see that. Very good, George.

38:21.421 --> 38:23.305
How did you get it to stay up like that?

38:23.425 --> 38:25.310
Well actually, Sir, this
little invention of yours

38:25.346 --> 38:26.491
has proven quite useful.

38:26.509 --> 38:29.418
I can see real potential
for household use here.

38:29.660 --> 38:31.020
It's a little sticky to use,

38:31.038 --> 38:34.099
but I think if we devised
some sort of dispensing device,

38:34.132 --> 38:35.835
we could be on to something.

38:35.955 --> 38:37.589
- Geroge...
- Sir I've... I've already come up

38:37.607 --> 38:39.655
- with quite a good name for it.
- Really?

38:39.775 --> 38:42.912
"Constable Crabtree's
Household Adhesive Strips."

38:43.032 --> 38:44.818
Oh, George.

38:44.938 --> 38:48.013
"Crabtree and Murdoch's
Household Adhesive Strips"

38:49.265 --> 38:51.583
Well, that's a lovely collection
of dirt you've got there.

38:51.601 --> 38:54.877
Ah, thank you, Sir. It's a
bit overwhelming right now.

38:54.894 --> 38:57.615
Yes, what we need is something to
help narrow our field of search.

38:57.651 --> 38:59.082
Well, this might be of help.

38:59.202 --> 39:01.149
It's from the Sheriff of Carson County.

39:01.364 --> 39:03.950
Looks like there was quite a
few railroad land shootings.

39:03.959 --> 39:07.091
And there's one name that is
of definite interest to us.

39:07.819 --> 39:09.713
Indeed.

39:19.896 --> 39:21.337
What is it, Sir?

39:21.457 --> 39:22.402
A horse hair.

39:22.522 --> 39:25.194
Oh, well, there are dozens
of horses in the show.

39:25.444 --> 39:27.603
Yes, but only one white one.

39:27.723 --> 39:31.852
Gentlemen I believe we'll
need to break out the armoury.

39:46.787 --> 39:48.992
Gentlemen, what can we do for you?

39:48.994 --> 39:51.816
Mr. Cody, we're here to make an arrest.

39:51.936 --> 39:55.029
Well, that's great news. Ain't
that great news, Theodore?

39:55.149 --> 39:56.353
Yes, Sir.

39:56.371 --> 39:58.098
So who's the dirty dog, then?

39:58.134 --> 40:00.899
Someone who wanted revenge
on Lightning and Jaws.

40:01.019 --> 40:03.700
Someone who had access to your horse.

40:04.013 --> 40:06.236
- My horse?
- Someone who...

40:06.356 --> 40:07.167
Whoa, Theodore,

40:07.287 --> 40:08.259
- what you doin'?
- Shut up, Cody.

40:08.304 --> 40:09.118
Take it easy, son.

40:09.154 --> 40:10.639
Teddy, put the gun down.

40:10.666 --> 40:13.529
Whatever you've done, we
can settle it reasonably.

40:13.547 --> 40:16.212
Too late to talk now,
isn't it? Don't even try it!

40:16.671 --> 40:17.816
Drop them shooters too.

40:17.852 --> 40:21.071
Drop them shooters? What are
you talking about, Theodore?

40:21.984 --> 40:24.371
Okay, all right, okay, all right.

40:24.982 --> 40:27.198
Teddy, we know about Chester.

40:27.318 --> 40:29.795
- Chester McGee?
- His name wasn't McGee?

40:30.034 --> 40:32.110
It was Jones.

40:32.683 --> 40:36.728
Theodore Chester Jones, Sr.

40:36.848 --> 40:39.004
And he wasn't a bad man, was he?

40:40.307 --> 40:41.730
He was just a farmer.

40:41.748 --> 40:44.513
Who happened to own some
land that the railways wanted.

40:44.964 --> 40:48.593
All my pa ever wanted was to
raise a few head of cattle.

40:48.900 --> 40:50.875
Then one day those two showed up,

40:51.179 --> 40:53.327
sent to drive us off our land.

40:53.447 --> 40:56.047
They were looking for
a reason to shoot him.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.069
Daring him.

40:58.189 --> 41:01.127
But my father never
took to violence. Never!

41:06.083 --> 41:07.758
He tried to walk away.

41:08.349 --> 41:10.129
They shot him in the back.

41:11.471 --> 41:13.699
Left him to die in front of me!

41:15.113 --> 41:17.610
Twelve years I've been
looking to put it right.

41:18.236 --> 41:20.338
Twelve years I've been practicing my shot.

41:20.383 --> 41:21.529
And then one day,

41:21.806 --> 41:23.694
I saw their faces

41:23.814 --> 41:26.191
- on a poster for your show.
- Theodore,

41:26.388 --> 41:28.708
- I had no idea.
- Yeah, I don't suppose you did.

41:29.048 --> 41:31.062
But then again, how could you?

41:31.182 --> 41:33.156
You never were much on asking questions.

41:33.192 --> 41:36.166
Teddy, what happened to your
father was a terrible crime.

41:38.466 --> 41:40.336
But Buffalo Bill had nothing to do with it.

41:40.345 --> 41:42.439
He used my father's death to make heroes

41:42.466 --> 41:45.174
out of two cowardly murderers.

41:46.940 --> 41:49.849
Teddy, your father was a good man.

41:49.969 --> 41:51.997
A peaceful man.

41:52.212 --> 41:54.941
He never would have wanted
things to end this way.

41:55.553 --> 41:59.208
For his son to give rise
to another wild west story.

42:00.694 --> 42:03.128
One where a young man would shoot and kill

42:03.128 --> 42:05.607
Buffalo Bill Cody in cold blood.

42:06.565 --> 42:09.195
Because that's all anyone
would ever remember.

42:11.039 --> 42:12.605
The myth

42:12.900 --> 42:16.328
would last much longer than the truth.

42:17.643 --> 42:19.665
Give me the gun.

42:22.931 --> 42:25.043
Give me the gun.

42:50.784 --> 42:53.379
Well, I have to admit, this
might just be my favourite part:

42:53.415 --> 42:55.482
when the whole thing comes down.

42:55.509 --> 42:56.824
I should think the end would be somewhat

42:56.824 --> 42:58.202
tinged with disappointment.

42:58.322 --> 43:01.272
Well, the wild west ended a
long time ago, Mr. Murdoch.

43:01.308 --> 43:03.312
But people still want
to know what it was like.

43:03.357 --> 43:05.460
So every time we pull
up like this and move on,

43:05.495 --> 43:07.777
it gives me a chance to bring
a little bit of it to 'em,

43:07.822 --> 43:09.702
and that's what gives me my pleasure now.

43:09.970 --> 43:13.362
Going to New York and Chicago and Boston,

43:13.845 --> 43:15.071
the entire continent of Europe.

43:15.098 --> 43:16.789
If I want to, I can go back to London

43:16.798 --> 43:18.400
and drop in on my old friend Victoria.

43:18.418 --> 43:19.992
Mr. Cody, it's been a pleasure.

43:20.112 --> 43:21.988
- If you'll excuse me?
- All right, Inspector.

43:23.321 --> 43:24.448
Mr. Murdoch, ?

43:24.797 --> 43:27.195
what do you think's
gonna become of that boy

43:27.315 --> 43:29.978
Well, he'll stand trial for
the crimes he's committed,

43:30.005 --> 43:31.678
receive the appropriate punishment.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.774
Same old thing. Another life wasted.

43:34.894 --> 43:37.682
- And who will replace Hank and Jaws?
- Well,

43:38.523 --> 43:40.322
perhaps it's best if some stories

43:40.340 --> 43:41.986
from the wild west are left untold.

43:42.201 --> 43:44.071
Thank you, Sir.

43:50.255 --> 43:51.848
Inspector.

43:53.047 --> 43:55.051
You know, last night was
the most fun I had since

43:55.087 --> 43:57.521
Bill Hickock and I cracked
a bottle back in Tucson.

43:57.557 --> 44:00.469
- The pleasure was all mine.
- Perhaps a farewell drink is in order.

44:00.589 --> 44:02.268
While I am sorely tempted,

44:02.313 --> 44:04.093
I'm afraid the answer must be no.

44:05.950 --> 44:08.093
A friend of mine once
gave me a piece of advice.

44:08.213 --> 44:10.652
He said, Don't try to be good;

44:11.476 --> 44:15.601
- Try not to be bad.
- Sage advice indeed. Miss Oakley.

44:17.570 --> 44:20.075
Say Hi to the missus for me.

44:27.056 --> 44:29.508
You should have seen the look in his eyes.

44:29.628 --> 44:33.436
Like he was possessed with a
bravery from the great beyond.

44:33.678 --> 44:36.416
With no gun, no night stick;

44:36.536 --> 44:38.573
armed only with his quick wits,

44:38.693 --> 44:41.946
a silver tongue, and a
firm belief in the law;

44:42.066 --> 44:43.575
he faced the lone gunman.

44:43.602 --> 44:45.222
They called him

44:45.562 --> 44:46.886
Murdoch.

44:47.826 --> 44:49.975
George,

44:50.628 --> 44:52.579
that's quite enough.
