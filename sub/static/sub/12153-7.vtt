<i>Friends, enemies.</i>

<i>There's no Better Business Bureau</i>

Customer complaints

00:30.300 --> 00:34.900
killing, torture, beating...

00:34.900 --> 00:37.100
sometimes fire.

00:38.800 --> 00:42.400
We call it word-of-mouth advertising.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.400
If I'd known this was going to be a seminar,
I'd have worn my name tag.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.500
[ Chuckles ] Just want to make sure
we know where we stand.

00:50.500 --> 00:53.400
Right now you're standing
on the brink of my patience.

00:53.400 --> 00:58.100
I agreed to meet with your distributor,
Emil, not your muscle.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.200
What? Dante and Philip?

01:01.200 --> 01:03.300
They're assistants...

01:03.300 --> 01:05.700
here to make us more comfortable.

01:05.700 --> 01:08.700
Don't think of them as muscle.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.800
Are you hungry?

01:11.800 --> 01:15.000
I could get Dante to fix you
a fish sandwich of some sort.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.500
- This is a waste of time.
- Please. Please.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.700
<i>My distributor is simply cautious.</i>

01:21.700 --> 01:24.900
He'd like me to verify the merchandise
before we move forward.

Now... who is this?

01:36.700 --> 01:39.100
My muscle.

01:39.100 --> 01:43.600
What we've got here is a modification
of the TS-1 1 3 sniper rifle.

01:43.600 --> 01:48.600
We've altered its targeting and firing
mechanisms to fit the parameters you gave us.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.600
The scope works along
amplified thermal wavelengths.

01:51.600 --> 01:55.900
Girl... you're making me
so hot right now.

01:55.900 --> 01:57.800
Wow.

01:57.800 --> 02:01.500
Turned on by a woman holding
an enormous gun. What a surprise.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.900
<i>We replaced the delivery system</i>
<i>with a balantine energy charge...</i>

02:05.900 --> 02:08.600
eliminating the need
for conventional ammunition.

02:08.600 --> 02:10.800
<i>[ Wesley ] Wolfram and Hart</i>
<i>has 200 units ready now.</i>

02:10.800 --> 02:13.700
We'll begin making more
once we receive payment.

02:13.700 --> 02:18.400
And your boss doesn't mind selling this
exciting weaponry to someone like me?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.600
As long as it doesn't show up in L.A.

02:20.600 --> 02:24.500
We choose our battles, Emil,
and you sidestepped the issue of payment.

02:24.500 --> 02:27.200
You'll get your money.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.400
You'll get nothing until I meet
with your distributor.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.700
- I'm not going through middlemen.
- Ah!

02:32.700 --> 02:36.500
Did you just refer to me as a middleman?

02:39.600 --> 02:43.400
You are lucky Wolfram and Hart has
such good word-of-mouth advertising.

02:44.700 --> 02:47.900
<i>Here. Call this number.</i>

02:47.900 --> 02:50.200
He'll arrange everything.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.800
To think, I used to sell this guy
collapsible swords.

<i>-Almost makes me--</i>

- I'm not sure.

Down!

03:10.300 --> 03:12.300
Yes, thank you, Wesley.
I'd love a gun.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.400

04:35.200 --> 04:37.000
[ Moans ]

05:35.100 --> 05:37.100
<i>[ Angel ]</i>
<i>She could've been killed.</i>

05:37.100 --> 05:39.400
<i>[ Eve ] Medical's optimistic.</i>
<i>She should be up and about soon.</i>

05:39.400 --> 05:42.400
<i>That's not the point. What the hell</i>
<i>was Fred doing there in the first place?</i>

05:42.400 --> 05:45.000
I needed someone who could explain
the weapon convincingly.

05:45.000 --> 05:47.200
Nobody else here knows
how to explain a gun?

05:47.200 --> 05:51.200
I needed someone who wouldn't arouse
Emil's suspicions, someone I could trust.

05:51.400 --> 05:55.800
And so, conveniently, the only person
who could go with you... was Fred.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.500
- What does that--
- She shouldn't have been there.
It was a reckless decision.

05:59.500 --> 06:03.100
Fred has more than proven herself
in the field. There was no reason to think--

06:03.100 --> 06:06.300
We found her bleeding to death
on the ground.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.600
<i>From now on,you clear it with me</i>
<i>before using any of my people.</i>

06:11.600 --> 06:13.600
- Your people?
- Got it?

06:22.800 --> 06:25.200
- Kind of hard on him, weren't you?
- Well, she could've--

06:25.200 --> 06:27.600
Been killed. So you said.

06:28.800 --> 06:31.400
I think you're making
too big a deal about this.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.600
From what I understand,
her wound wasn't all that severe.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.700
- You weren't there. You didn't see her.
- But she's okay.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.700
- You're still beating him up.
- He can be careless.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.200
Focuses too much
on the big picture?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.900
- Overlooks the people involved?
- Something like that.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.100
Willing to risk anything or anyone...

06:48.100 --> 06:50.000
for the greater good.

06:50.000 --> 06:54.000
But, hey, I'm just asking.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.300
Could it be there is another reason...

06:56.300 --> 06:59.200
you're getting so mad at him
about this?

06:59.200 --> 07:01.100
Hmm.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.700
Stealing your son, for instance?

07:03.700 --> 07:05.600
We don't talk about my son.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.300
You don't trust Wesley, do you?

07:08.300 --> 07:12.600
I mean, I can see that. He did
turn Connor over to your sworn enemy.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.900
He didn't mean for that to happen.
He thought he was doing the right thing.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.100
And I guess it all worked out.
Connor's okay.

07:19.100 --> 07:23.100
<i>You're happy. Maybe Wesley knew</i>
<i>what he was doing after all.</i>

07:24.600 --> 07:26.900
Even if he doesn't remember any of it.

07:26.900 --> 07:30.200
That's got nothing to do with--

07:30.200 --> 07:33.100
I just want to be kept informed.
That's all.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.200
<i>Is it?</i>

07:35.200 --> 07:39.500
Or are you worried about the next time Wesley
betrays you, trying to do the right thing?

07:43.500 --> 07:47.400
- They gave me the all clear.
- I was just coming down to find you.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.300
Though I do have to take
a boatload of antibiotics.

07:50.300 --> 07:53.800
Apparently there's some concern
about where that grappling hook's been.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.200
We're taking the cyborg apart
in the lab right now.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.400
You should see how intricate it is.

07:58.400 --> 08:02.100
It's like an M.C. Escher picture,
but with wires and flesh instead of geese.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.300
I'm sorry about what happened, Fred.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.400
Are you kidding me?

08:06.400 --> 08:09.800
I feel bad because all I had to do was hide,
and I couldn't even do that right.

08:09.800 --> 08:13.400
- I should have done a better job protecting you.
- What?

08:13.400 --> 08:16.200
[ Groans ]
That didn't come out--

08:16.200 --> 08:19.500
Do you realize how patronizing that sounds?
Protecting me?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.700
I just meant you shouldn't have
been there in the first place.

08:21.700 --> 08:25.000
- That's not for you to decide.
- Yes, it is, actually.

08:25.000 --> 08:28.000
<i>I made the call. I screwed up.</i>

08:28.000 --> 08:31.900
Listen to you. You're blaming yourself
because poor Fred got hurt.

08:31.900 --> 08:35.900
Stop trying to be all valiant.
You're coming off like a self-pitying child.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.900
- Hello, Father.
- Oh, yeah. That's mature.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.700
I wish I was your father.
I'd tell you to grow up.

08:43.700 --> 08:46.800
It doesn't work. I've tried.

08:46.800 --> 08:48.800
What are you doing here?

08:48.800 --> 08:52.800
- You're Wesley's--
- I see manners are still my son's strong point.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.400
Roger Wyndam-Pryce.
How do you do?

08:57.400 --> 09:00.500
Winifred Burkle.
I-I didn't realize you were--

09:00.500 --> 09:02.600
Um, we were just--

09:02.600 --> 09:07.600
I, um, have an employee
that I have to belittle...

09:07.600 --> 09:10.400
<i>and to show him I'm in charge.</i>

09:10.400 --> 09:13.200
I-- I should let you two catch up.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.300
It was really nice to meet you.

09:15.300 --> 09:18.700
- I'm sure I'll see you again soon.
- The pleasure is mine.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.800
''Self-pitying child''?

09:25.800 --> 09:30.200
Imagine how humiliating
that will be for her employee.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.800
What are you--
Is Mom all right?

09:33.800 --> 09:36.500
She's fine.

09:36.500 --> 09:38.400
Sturdy as ever.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.200
No, you and I
have business to discuss.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.500
Business.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.600
Oh. Of course. Please.

09:49.900 --> 09:52.300
Sit down.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.800
As you may well know...

09:54.800 --> 09:57.600
the Watchers Council
was destroyed last year.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.500
I heard.

09:59.500 --> 10:02.000
The remaining former Watchers,
myself included...

10:02.000 --> 10:05.000
have decided to re-form the Council...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.100
and I've been sent to contact you.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.300
Are you saying the Council
wants me to come back?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.300
Not necessarily.

10:14.300 --> 10:16.800
Your name's proven to be
a point of contention.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.600
There are some who believe
that your tenure as Watcher...

10:19.600 --> 10:21.500
ranks as our most embarrassing failure.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.100
Really?

10:25.100 --> 10:28.400
I beat out everybody dying
in an explosion...

10:28.400 --> 10:30.500
as most embarrassing failure.

10:30.500 --> 10:34.200
Friends and colleagues lost their lives
in that event, Wesley.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.500
A little respect.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.200
Sorry.

10:39.200 --> 10:43.700
The Council have agreed to take you back,
pending my assessment.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.600
I'm here to evaluate you.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.500
I see.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.300
Well, I'll save you the trouble.
I'm not interested.

10:57.300 --> 11:02.000
This is no time to be stubborn, boy.

11:02.000 --> 11:05.400
The Council are giving you
a chance to clear your name.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.700
<i>Our</i> name.

11:07.700 --> 11:11.000

but I'm perfectly happy where I am.

[ Chuckles ]
Wolfram and Hart?

11:14.700 --> 11:18.100

11:18.100 --> 11:21.000
Not anymore.
This isn't the Wolfram and-- [ Groans ]

11:21.000 --> 11:23.500
- Oh!
- Sorry.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.800
It's okay. It's no problem.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.800
Sorry.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.300
I'm sorry.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.500
- You have the wrong idea about this place.
- Do I?

11:38.500 --> 11:42.400
The atrocities committed by Wolfram and Hart
are quite well documented.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.400
We're working to change that.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.500
Under our control, this firm's
becoming a... powerful weapon...

11:47.500 --> 11:50.000
one that I think
can make a difference.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000

No, don't tell him that.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.200
Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,
you should be ashamed.

12:14.200 --> 12:18.700
- I didn't know you had a younger brother.
- Lorne. Yes.

12:18.700 --> 12:21.700
This is my father,

12:21.700 --> 12:24.400
- How do you do?
- Father?

12:24.400 --> 12:26.400
Oh, I don't believe it.

12:26.400 --> 12:29.600
Okay, I do believe it, but only 'cause
I heard you were in the building.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.100
[ Chuckling ]
Well, look at you.

12:32.100 --> 12:35.600
It's like Winston Churchill
and a young Richard Harris...

12:35.600 --> 12:37.700
had a beautiful love child...

12:37.700 --> 12:42.800
which, according to my sources,
may not be as ridiculous as it sounds.

12:42.800 --> 12:46.800
- Lorne runs our entertainment division.
- Entertainment division?

12:46.800 --> 12:50.300
I can see how that would be very useful
in the fight against evil.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.800
You'd be amazed at how many
horrible movies we've stopped.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.200
- Gunn, this is my father.
- It's an honor.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.700
This place is buzzing about you.
You better watch out.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.500
If you're anything like your son here,
we might put you to work.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.900
- You might be out of luck.
- Listen, the lab called for you.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.300
They're working on RoboCop upstairs,
need your help.

13:05.300 --> 13:08.600
- RoboCop?
- We had an encounter with a cyborg last night...

13:08.600 --> 13:11.900
while we were infiltrating
a weapons ring.

13:11.900 --> 13:15.200
I should head up there.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.900
- Would you like to come along?
- Yes.

13:17.900 --> 13:22.200
- If I'm not in the way.
- No. Not at all.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.900
<i>[ Fred ]</i>
<i>We found cybernetics throughout the body...</i>

13:28.900 --> 13:31.300

replacing entire organic systems.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.400
- Was it human?
- We think so.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.600
The nervous system
seems human at least...

13:35.600 --> 13:40.000
but the rest of the technology's so foreign
to us, we can't be sure of anything right now.

13:40.000 --> 13:43.500
This thing really blurs the line
between human and robot.

13:43.500 --> 13:47.800
Aha. So you're not ruling out that
a human being could have boffed a robot.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.500
Sex with robots is more common
than most people think.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.400
Um...

13:55.400 --> 13:59.100
the cybernetics require
central processing to function...

13:59.100 --> 14:01.400
which means
if we can crack its memory...

14:01.400 --> 14:04.700
we may find a record of everything
it's done until this point.

14:04.700 --> 14:07.900
