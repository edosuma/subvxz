Two firearms
for two gift cards.

00:12.620 --> 00:15.000
Thanks for making our streets
a little safer.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.670
So, we're just
gonna destroy these?

00:16.670 --> 00:19.000
What if one
was used in a crime?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.540
Hey, "no questions asked"
means just that.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.920
And it's the best way
to get people

00:22.920 --> 00:24.460
to turn in
their unregistered weapons.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.540
That and the $100 gift cards.

00:28.580 --> 00:32.170
Nolan:
Oh. Hang on a second. Sorry.

00:32.170 --> 00:33.170
Let me help you with those.

00:33.170 --> 00:35.670
Oh. Thank you...
Officer Nolan.

00:35.670 --> 00:37.290
-Yeah. And you are?
-I'm Alma.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.830
Nice to meet you.
Are all these yours?

00:39.830 --> 00:42.330
Oh, no, no.
They -- They were my father's.

00:42.330 --> 00:45.750
He was a paratrooper
back in World War II.

00:46.750 --> 00:48.250
And when he came back
from the war,

00:48.250 --> 00:49.670
he brought all this
with him.

00:49.670 --> 00:51.580
I've been carrying it
with me

00:51.580 --> 00:53.460
since he passed in '74.

00:53.460 --> 00:56.330
Oh, Alma...

00:56.330 --> 00:57.920
this is
in good condition.

00:57.920 --> 00:59.580
You could get real money
for this.
Oh, no.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.330
I wouldn't know
where to start.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.040
Besides, I'm moving in
with my son's family.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.000
I don't want these
around my grandkids.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.830
Well, we are here to help.

01:07.830 --> 01:10.500
Oh, those were his pistols.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.830
He brought them from Germany
to San Francisco.

01:13.830 --> 01:16.830
And that one there
is Ginny.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.040
Alma, is that a land mine?

01:20.040 --> 01:23.670
Yes, a claymore, I think.

01:23.670 --> 01:25.500
From his time in Vietnam.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.040
Uh, can we get a bomb squad
to the front lobby? Now.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.330
Well, I'm so glad
you brought this in,

01:29.330 --> 01:30.830
because these
are extremely unstable.

01:30.830 --> 01:32.920
Tell you what.
I'm gonna stay here
to dispose of this.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.920
Officer Chen is gonna get you
to a safe distance,

01:34.920 --> 01:37.000
and then we'll get you those
gift cards we talked about.

01:37.000 --> 01:41.000
Oh, uh, what about
the ones in my trunk?

01:43.250 --> 01:46.040
♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
whoa, oh, oh ♪

01:46.040 --> 01:48.170

No, no, no, I'm not upset.

01:56.330 --> 01:59.500
I'm just surprised
at how fast it happened.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.120
All right, text me
when you get back to campus.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.960
Love you, too.
Bye.

02:03.960 --> 02:05.330
-Hey.
-Hey!

02:05.330 --> 02:06.500
Oh.

02:06.500 --> 02:08.250
Oh, I know I said
Sedona had some easy hikes,

02:08.250 --> 02:09.830
but you should at least
put on shoes.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.500
Sarah just accepted
an offer on the house.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.170
That's my girl.
Well, it's a seller's market.

02:15.170 --> 02:18.460
Besides, it's not like you're
going back to Foxburg.

02:18.460 --> 02:21.250
Unless the house
was your safety net

02:21.250 --> 02:23.500
in case this didn't pan out.
-No.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.040
-Okay.
-I just always imagined

02:25.040 --> 02:27.080
Henry raising his own kids
there, you know?

02:27.080 --> 02:29.040
Mark their height
on the same doorjamb

02:29.040 --> 02:30.830
and camping
in the backyard like we did.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.210
Aww. That's sweet,
Mr. Cleaver.

02:33.210 --> 02:35.210
But Henry's 18.

02:35.210 --> 02:36.580
Like, the last thing
he's thinking about

02:36.580 --> 02:37.920
is inheriting your house.

02:37.920 --> 02:41.420
He's out there
starting a new life.

02:41.420 --> 02:43.170
As are you.

02:43.170 --> 02:45.210
So go get dressed.

02:45.210 --> 02:46.670
We have quite
an adventure ahead.

02:46.670 --> 02:49.920
Yes, we do.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.000
"Mandatory Emergency Callback
for all patrol."

02:53.000 --> 02:55.290
Huh.
What does that mean?

02:55.290 --> 02:58.880
It means we're having
different adventures today.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.830
Capt. Andersen: Thank you
for coming in on your day off.

03:00.830 --> 03:04.500
The Vice President is making an
unscheduled visit to our city.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.880
So it's all hands on deck.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.540
Agent Danvers.
Thank you, Captain.

03:08.540 --> 03:10.250
As always,
the Secret Service

03:10.250 --> 03:12.120
appreciates
the LAPD's assistance

03:12.120 --> 03:14.880
in clearing and securing
"Redwood's" route.

03:14.880 --> 03:17.620
These are your
Operation Plan Manuals.

03:17.620 --> 03:19.620
Each officer's name
has been listed

03:19.620 --> 03:21.750
under a specific
Quadrant and Zone,

03:21.750 --> 03:23.670
along with your
responsibilities.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.670
Your watch commander
will liaison with me

03:25.670 --> 03:27.670
throughout the day
as issues arise.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.290
Come on...

03:29.290 --> 03:32.170
I'm sorry.
Officer West.

03:32.170 --> 03:34.540
Is there something you want
to share with the group?

03:34.540 --> 03:36.380
Um, no, sir. Uh...

03:36.380 --> 03:37.500
I'm sorry.
I just, uh --

03:37.500 --> 03:39.710
I had plans
I needed to cancel.

03:39.710 --> 03:42.880
So did everyone here,
yet they're paying attention.

03:42.880 --> 03:44.670
Yes, sir.

03:44.670 --> 03:47.540
These assignments
are your sole priority today.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.580
You will not field calls
from dispatch.

03:49.580 --> 03:51.750
Let the day shift
deal with that.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.500
Captain?

03:53.500 --> 03:54.830
Most of you
know the drill.

03:54.830 --> 03:58.670
For our rookies --
Today is going to be ugly.

03:58.670 --> 04:01.250
Everything we do to ensure
the safety of Redwood

04:01.250 --> 04:03.000
will create gridlock.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.750
It's important to be patient
and vigilant.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.000
That's all.
You're dismissed.

04:09.210 --> 04:10.420
Bishop and Nolan.

04:10.420 --> 04:12.420
Agent Danvers has a special
assignment for you.

04:14.710 --> 04:18.170
We've got a Class 2 threat
we need chased down.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.750
Class 2?

04:19.750 --> 04:21.040
Class 1 is someone

04:21.040 --> 04:22.500
who's made overt
threatening statements

04:22.500 --> 04:24.080
but made no overt action.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.170
Class 2 are individuals

04:25.170 --> 04:27.080
who have a history of
assaultive behaviors

04:27.080 --> 04:28.080
toward authority figures.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.080
And Class 3?

04:29.080 --> 04:30.750
Had agents
on their doorsteps

04:30.750 --> 04:32.710
the second we learned
of this visit.

04:32.710 --> 04:33.750
Stanley Knott.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.620
Guy's made repeated threats
against the VP

04:35.620 --> 04:36.670
over the last few years.

04:36.670 --> 04:37.620
Nothing actionable,

04:37.620 --> 04:39.330
but he's got
previous assault charges

04:39.330 --> 04:41.250
against a host
of supervisors.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.500
I need you to make sure
he's not planning anything.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.710
-Happy to do it, ma'am.
-Great.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.210
Call me if you need
any assistance.

04:49.210 --> 04:50.830
-"Happy to do it"?
-What?

04:50.830 --> 04:53.540
Nothing. I've just never heard
you use that word before.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.380
Lucy:
I don't get all the fuss.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.000
It seems like we're getting
a day of overtime

04:57.000 --> 04:59.830
just to close roads
and hang signs.

04:59.830 --> 05:02.210
That's like saying being
drawn and quartered is
fun time with horses.

05:02.210 --> 05:03.920
We're literally creating
traffic jams

05:03.920 --> 05:06.080
during rush hour on purpose.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.210
Everything we do today
is gonna piss someone off.

05:09.210 --> 05:10.750
-Quadrant One.
-Quadrant Two.

05:10.750 --> 05:13.000
I mean, we deal with angry
people every shift,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.540
but a day of OT
means I can finally fix

05:15.540 --> 05:17.670
the air-conditioning on my car.

05:19.210 --> 05:21.830
What?
Air-conditioning
makes you soft.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.710
You gotta get comfortable
with being uncomfortable.

05:23.710 --> 05:25.920
That's the job.
-Is he serious?

05:25.920 --> 05:27.960
As a heart attack, Boot.
Which -- I gotta say --

05:27.960 --> 05:30.000
you almost gave the watch
commander back there.
Seriously.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.210
Playing with your phone during
a briefing is a cardinal sin.

05:32.210 --> 05:33.750
I-I lost focus.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.620
I only hope you were canceling
something important,

05:35.620 --> 05:37.670
because Grey won't forget that
for a while.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.500
Just, uh,
breakfast with my mom.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.960
-Is that all for us?
-Yep.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.960
Extra road flares
for the uptick in accidents.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.790
Extra ticket books
for the increase in idiots.

05:47.790 --> 05:50.080
Extra crime-scene tape
for blocking sidewalks.

05:50.080 --> 05:52.710
And cones for closing roads.
-Okay, okay, I get it.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.460
Oh, we're not done yet.
Hats and Bats.

05:54.460 --> 05:57.080
Tactical helmets and 42-inch
batons for riot control,

05:57.080 --> 05:59.460
along with heavy-duty vests
if things get ugly.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.290
And my personal favorite,

06:01.290 --> 06:02.830
the 40-millimeter
tear-gas launcher

06:02.830 --> 06:04.620
for when democracy
gets real.

06:04.620 --> 06:06.920
But, hey, at least you'll
be able to ride in comfort.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.710
Nolan: Do you think our Class 2
threat is actually a threat?

06:28.710 --> 06:30.210
Maybe.

06:30.210 --> 06:32.000
Maybe writing hate-letters
to the Veep

06:32.000 --> 06:34.330
is just his way
of blowing off steam.

06:34.330 --> 06:37.710
Did you just "glass half-full"
our suspect?

06:37.710 --> 06:40.000
Who are you and what have you
done with my T.O.?

06:40.000 --> 06:43.210
Look, I'm trying a much more
positive approach.

06:43.210 --> 06:45.830
But if you'd rather I go back
to yesterday's attitude...

06:45.830 --> 06:47.330
Oh, no, no, no, no.

06:47.330 --> 06:49.170
Uh, no one's a bigger fan
of positive than me.

06:55.330 --> 06:56.540
That cannot be right.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.080
-Problem?
-No. Sorry.

06:58.080 --> 06:59.750
My ex is selling our house.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.170
I largely stayed out of it

07:02.170 --> 07:03.460
because, honestly,
I didn't want her to,

07:03.460 --> 07:04.750
but I just saw the price
she's getting.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.580
The place has doubled
in value.

07:06.580 --> 07:07.670
Mm, that sounds like

07:07.670 --> 07:09.080
a good thing to me,
Officer Positive.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.750
N-No, it is. Yes.

07:10.750 --> 07:13.120
I was just thinking about trying
to buy her out, you know,

07:13.120 --> 07:15.120
keep it in the family,
but...

07:15.120 --> 07:16.620
I can't match that price.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.420
There's our guy.

07:18.420 --> 07:19.580
Hey, Stanley.

07:19.580 --> 07:21.420
Can we talk to you
for a minute?

07:21.420 --> 07:23.290
-What do you want?
-Haven't you heard?

07:23.290 --> 07:24.710
Your friend's in town.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.330
What friend?
I don't have a friend.

07:26.330 --> 07:27.330
Vice President.

07:27.330 --> 07:29.500
So what?

07:29.500 --> 07:31.250
So what's in the bag,
Stanley?

07:31.250 --> 07:32.500
Nothing.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.580
Show us.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.500
No.
We're not asking.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.580
We have probable cause
based on your prior actions

07:37.580 --> 07:38.830
and clear distress.

07:47.000 --> 07:50.670
Come on. Hands.
Let's go.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.040
-Weapon.
-It's just a flare gun.

07:53.040 --> 07:56.250
I don't need a license.
I looked it up online.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.420
Were you planning
on pointing that flare gun

07:58.420 --> 08:00.250
at the Vice President today,
Stanley?

08:00.250 --> 08:02.080
-He needs to be stopped.
-Sounds like a "yes" to me.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.290
You're under arrest,
Stanley.

08:03.290 --> 08:06.880
Did we just foil a real-life
assassination attempt?

08:06.880 --> 08:08.790
He's a nut with a flare gun
wrapped in underpants.

08:08.790 --> 08:11.000
Not Jason Bourne.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.670
But we just might have
prevented a tragedy.

08:13.670 --> 08:14.670
Was that so hard?

08:14.670 --> 08:15.790
Woman: Whose streets?

08:15.790 --> 08:17.540
All: Our streets!
Woman: Whose streets?

08:17.540 --> 08:19.540
Man: One, two, three!

08:19.540 --> 08:20.420
All: Our streets!

08:20.420 --> 08:21.420
Woman: No justice.

08:21.420 --> 08:22.790
All: No peace!

08:24.460 --> 08:26.290
Woman: No justice.
All: No peace!

08:26.290 --> 08:28.330
Woman: No justice.
All: No peace!

08:28.330 --> 08:30.330
Officer West, we're about
to walk into a volatile crowd,

08:30.330 --> 08:32.380
and you're answering
your phone?
Um, no, ma'am.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.670
No, I'm sorry.
It's just my mom.

08:34.670 --> 08:37.040
I never got
to call her back earlier.
Now is not the time
for personal calls.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.500
-Of course.
-Okay, folks, you can't be here.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.880
There's a designated
protest area across the street,

08:41.880 --> 08:44.000
behind the barriers.
We have a right
to free speech.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.880
This is public property.
Jackson: It's not.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.170
This is
the hotel's property,

08:47.170 --> 08:48.830
and blocking the entrance
is a fire hazard.

08:48.830 --> 08:50.710
-No justice!
-No peace!

08:50.710 --> 08:51.880
-No justice.

08:51.880 --> 08:53.290
-You got a dispersal card?
-Yes, ma'am.

08:53.290 --> 08:54.500
-No justice!
-No peace!

08:54.500 --> 08:56.670
I am Officer Jackson West.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.330
I hereby declare this
to be an unlawful assembly,

08:59.330 --> 09:02.040
and, in the name of the People
of the State of California,

09:02.040 --> 09:04.880
command all those assembled
to immediately disperse.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.460
You heard him.
Break it up or go to jail.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.080
Who has a key
for the handcuffs?

09:11.750 --> 09:13.620
Notify
the mobile field force.

09:13.620 --> 09:16.880
-Arnold?! What's wrong?
-He's choking.

09:16.880 --> 09:19.460
Oh, my God, Arnold...
Miss, give Officer Lopez
some space.

09:32.040 --> 09:35.040
Tim: All right, listen up.
Listen up!

09:35.040 --> 09:37.500
Until tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.,
the stretch of Vine

09:37.500 --> 09:40.830
between Melrose and Franklin
will be off limits.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.170
Sanitation services will be
arriving in 20 minutes.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.540
You'll have until then
to pack up.

09:45.540 --> 09:47.290
Rope off the block.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.830
Make sure everyone moves off.

09:54.420 --> 09:57.330
Sir? Sir?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.540
Sorry to wake you,

09:58.540 --> 10:00.330
but I'm gonna need you
to start packing up, all right?

10:03.000 --> 10:05.460
-Bitch, those are my sneakers!
-Get out!

10:05.460 --> 10:07.830
Oh, hey! Hey, hey!

10:07.830 --> 10:09.380
Hey! Stop it!

10:09.380 --> 10:11.380
Just stop.

10:13.460 --> 10:15.380
That's enough!
Hey. That's enough.

10:15.380 --> 10:18.040
Woman: Ow. Ow.
Hands behind your back.
Don't move.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.540
All right. Stand up.

10:21.540 --> 10:22.790
Here we go.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.750
-Chen.
-What?

10:26.750 --> 10:29.000
Stop. Don't move.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.380
Tim: Chen.

10:43.380 --> 10:44.500
Chen.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.420
Chen.

10:46.420 --> 10:49.040
I didn't see it.
I mean, it was...

10:49.040 --> 10:50.830
it was on the ground, and --
-It's okay,

10:50.830 --> 10:52.420
but I need to pull
the needle out.

11:05.460 --> 11:08.080
What's the procedure when
an officer is exposed on duty?

11:09.670 --> 11:12.170
-What?
-Focus.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.080
What do we do now?

11:14.080 --> 11:16.170
Um...

11:16.170 --> 11:17.830
"Collect the evidence.

11:17.830 --> 11:20.620
Bring the officer and the item
to the nearest hospital

11:20.620 --> 11:24.000
to test for infections
and diseases

11:24.000 --> 11:25.500
that may
have been transmitted."

11:25.500 --> 11:27.420
And where's
the nearest hospital?

11:27.420 --> 11:28.710
Shaw Memorial.

11:30.460 --> 11:31.790
Make sure an officer
posts up here

11:31.790 --> 11:33.000
until Veep passes through.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.120
-Got it.
-Come on. Let's go.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.120
Jackson:
Hey, Mom, it's me.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.620
Um,
sorry about this morning.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.620
Uh, just call me back, okay?
I need t--

11:46.620 --> 11:50.960
Um, just --
just call me back, okay?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.540
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

11:52.540 --> 11:54.960
Nothing.
Just family stuff.

11:54.960 --> 11:57.330
I can't believe I have to wear
this bulky vest all day.

11:57.330 --> 12:00.170
That's why you always
carry an extra uniform
on days like today.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.170
Yeah, I know.
I, uh -- I just --

12:02.170 --> 12:03.960
Forgot?

12:03.960 --> 12:05.080
Get it together,
Officer West.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.670
You can't afford
to lose focus out here.

12:13.750 --> 12:17.790
Which side of the building
faces the street?
To the right.

12:17.790 --> 12:20.580
Should we really be
penalizing these people
for their civic engagement?

12:20.580 --> 12:23.500
Supreme Court ruled that
displaying anatomically
impossible pictures

12:23.500 --> 12:24.830
qualifies as obscene,

12:24.830 --> 12:26.750
so hanging erotic banners
of the V.P.

12:26.750 --> 12:28.670
in 10 windows
of an apartment building

12:28.670 --> 12:30.290
definitely isn't protected
by the First Amendment.

12:30.290 --> 12:31.880
I'm just saying,
the guy should be flattered.

12:33.080 --> 12:34.620
Police. Open up.

12:39.170 --> 12:40.500
What's up?

12:40.500 --> 12:42.000
You have an obscene banner
hanging in your window.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.170
It needs to come down.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.580
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

12:44.580 --> 12:46.830
My neighbor offered me 100 bucks
to put that there.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.120
Well, it's illegal.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.330
No problem.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.920
I'll make sure
to take care of it.

12:50.920 --> 12:53.500
Sir, is there something inside
you don't want us to see?

12:53.500 --> 12:56.210
No.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.500
Step back.
Hands where I can see them.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.380
What the hell is this?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.670
Sir, how many people
live here?

13:02.670 --> 13:05.000
-Um...not many.
-Pat him down.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.670
Polícia! Polícia!
Jackson: So much
for the element of surprise.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.540
It's okay.
We're not here for them.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.250
Go get the banner.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.210
What do you charge
these people?

13:34.210 --> 13:36.210
$500 a month times 20?

13:36.210 --> 13:37.460
That's taking
advantage of people

13:37.460 --> 13:39.000
too afraid to call the police
on your ass.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Got it.
Do we have to call ICE?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.670
No, L.A.'s
a sanctuary city.

13:42.670 --> 13:44.040
Our job is
to police the streets,

13:44.040 --> 13:45.250
not check status.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.880
But we're not
letting this go.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.420
Get his driver's license
and do an F.I.

13:50.420 --> 13:54.460
We'll be back tomorrow
with code enforcement.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.380
Hi. Um, I need to get
my blood tested.

14:01.380 --> 14:03.460
I got stuck with a used
hypodermic needle.

14:03.460 --> 14:07.670
Oh. Uh, yeah, one sec.

14:07.670 --> 14:10.170
Um, where did that --

14:11.170 --> 14:12.670
If you could fill this out.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.620
Have a seat in the waiting room,
and we'll be right with you.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.250
You must be new,

14:16.250 --> 14:17.380
because
no experienced nurse

14:17.380 --> 14:18.830
lets an armed cop
sit with civilians.

14:18.830 --> 14:19.960
What do you think happens

14:19.960 --> 14:21.500
if somebody attempts
to grab her weapon?

14:21.500 --> 14:22.670
I-I-I --

14:22.670 --> 14:23.830
The hospital protocol
dictates

14:23.830 --> 14:25.330
that an armed officer
be seen immediately.

14:25.330 --> 14:28.080
So set her up in a room
right now and find a doctor.

14:29.670 --> 14:32.170
Yes, sir.

14:32.170 --> 14:33.880
Right this way.

14:37.670 --> 14:40.170
Nolan: When do rookies
get a step increase in pay?

14:40.170 --> 14:42.000
Not until
you're off probation.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
This about the house?
Yeah.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.380
I'm thinking about buying it
as an investment.

14:45.380 --> 14:46.580
I'm sure Sarah
will sell it to me

14:46.580 --> 14:48.380
if I can just...
match the offer.

14:48.380 --> 14:50.620
It's not an investment
if you can't afford it.

14:50.620 --> 14:52.500
Well, I have some savings.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.670
Maybe Ben
will give me a loan.

14:54.670 --> 14:56.330
The only thing
worse than going into debt

14:56.330 --> 14:58.210
is doing it with a friend.
I get it.

14:58.210 --> 15:01.620
It's just I built that house
from the ground up.

15:01.620 --> 15:02.790
You know, everything --

15:02.790 --> 15:05.500
The tree house
in the backyard.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.880
My son's whole life
was at that place.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.000
Sounds nice.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.790
It was.

15:13.790 --> 15:15.880
We never really talk about
where you're from.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.460
Let's just say
it didn't have a tree house.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.500
It's a good job
on the Class 2.

15:20.500 --> 15:23.120
As a reward,
you get another assignment.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.500
Look,
it's not so special.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.460
Every job
is an opportunity, sir.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.670
Is she feeling okay?
Being positive.

15:29.670 --> 15:31.500
Positive? Good.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.330
'Cause I'm assigning you both
to rover duty.

15:33.330 --> 15:36.170
-What's that?
-LAPD version of a Gofer.

15:36.170 --> 15:37.460
You'll spend
the rest of your shift

15:37.460 --> 15:38.880
assisting officers
all over the city --

15:38.880 --> 15:40.040
bringing them
food and water,

15:40.040 --> 15:42.120
giving them
bathroom breaks.

15:42.120 --> 15:44.290
Here's a backlog
of requests.

15:44.290 --> 15:45.580
Get to it.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.080
Well, it's an opportunity

15:49.080 --> 15:50.830
to support
our fellow officers.

15:50.830 --> 15:52.250
Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.960
It's starting
to freak me out.

15:59.710 --> 16:01.380
Can I help you,
officers?

16:01.380 --> 16:03.380
Ma'am, there's an obscene banner
hanging in your window.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.830
We need you
to remove it.

16:04.830 --> 16:06.830
I'm sorry,
but I can't do that.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.500
Jackson: We know
your neighbor paid you.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.330
But it's a violation
of Penal Code 415.5.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.000
We can arrest you
for having it up.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.750
-I need that money.
-Ma'am, it's only $100.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.040
Only?!

16:18.330 --> 16:20.330
Have you ever been broke,
Officer?

16:20.330 --> 16:22.290
Because I'm on the edge
of living on the street.

16:22.290 --> 16:23.960
And that $100
is the difference

16:23.960 --> 16:25.830
between me being able to pay
my rent this month

16:25.830 --> 16:27.120
and getting evicted.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.460
Look, ma'am, I'm very sorry
to hear that,

16:28.460 --> 16:30.710
but, um, you have to take
the banner down.

16:34.960 --> 16:37.210
But we just became aware
of major code violations

16:37.210 --> 16:38.960
in one of these apartments.

16:38.960 --> 16:41.000
I see no reason why forgiving
your rent for a few months

16:41.000 --> 16:42.830
couldn't be part of
the building owner's penalty.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.500
Really?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.080
Really.

16:46.080 --> 16:47.750
Now go take down
that banner.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.540
Officers.

16:57.540 --> 16:59.170
Let us know if you need
anything else.

16:59.170 --> 17:02.540
So, what's with
the positive attitude?

17:02.540 --> 17:04.000
Do I need a reason?
No.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.670
It's just after
four months together,

17:05.670 --> 17:07.040
it's the first day
you've rolled in with it.

17:07.040 --> 17:08.960
I figured
something must be up.

17:10.830 --> 17:12.210
That can't be good.

17:12.210 --> 17:14.210
How the hell did you
not see me?!
You cut in front of me!

17:14.210 --> 17:15.880
You wouldn't let me in!
Yeah?

17:15.880 --> 17:17.750
Yeah!
Learn how to drive, man!

17:17.750 --> 17:18.750
Whoa. Hey, man, I --

17:18.750 --> 17:20.210
Gun!

17:20.210 --> 17:21.580
Praveen: I'm sorry.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.080
Nolan: Drop the gun!

17:24.080 --> 17:26.710
Put the gun on the ground
right now.

17:26.710 --> 17:29.290
Hands behind your head.
Interlace your fingers.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.000
Do not move.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.500
I-I was just trying
to scare him.

17:38.330 --> 17:39.750
Nolan!

17:39.750 --> 17:41.120
Over here. With me.
Come on.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.290
Control, 7-Adam-15.
We have a gunshot victim --

17:42.290 --> 17:45.000
female, adult,
shotgun wound to the chest.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.250
We need fire and ambulance.
ETA?

17:46.250 --> 17:47.750
Dispatch: 7-Adam-15,
at least 10 minutes.

17:47.750 --> 17:49.380
Talia: Okay, help me
get her out of the car.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.960
We need to stop
the bleeding.

17:50.960 --> 17:54.170
Come on. I got you.
I got you. Come on.

17:54.170 --> 17:55.670
-Got that?
-Uh-huh.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.880
I didn't mean
to hurt her!

17:58.880 --> 18:00.790
Shut up! Look away.

18:00.790 --> 18:02.580
All right, stay with us.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.210
We're gonna get you
to a hospital.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.210
It's a chest wound.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.500
It sounds like
her lung's collapsed.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.830
Put pressure on it.

18:07.830 --> 18:08.920
We're gonna need to put
something in the wound --

18:08.920 --> 18:10.380
keep her alive
till EMTs get here.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.580
-Officer Bishop.
-Get the kit bag --

18:13.580 --> 18:14.960
There's gotta be something
in there we can use.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.120
Talia.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.540
She's gone.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.830
-You okay?
-What do you think?

18:40.830 --> 18:43.460
Sorry.
It was a dumb question.

18:49.880 --> 18:53.170
Sorry, I didn't mean
to snap at you.

18:53.170 --> 18:55.710
My therapist is trying
to get me to be more positive.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.540
You asked why I was acting
differently today.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.460
No, I just --
I didn't know you went.

19:01.460 --> 19:05.040
No reason you should.
'Cause the job frowns on it?

19:05.040 --> 19:07.830
'Cause it's nobody's business.

19:07.830 --> 19:09.750
But, yeah...

19:09.750 --> 19:12.750
it is looked at as a weakness
amongst the boys in blue.

19:12.750 --> 19:15.290
Well, that's stupid.

19:15.290 --> 19:16.540
Lot of stressful stuff
we deal with,

19:16.540 --> 19:17.670
what we just went through,

19:17.670 --> 19:21.210
it's unhealthy
not to talk about it.

19:21.210 --> 19:23.880
Does that mean
you see someone?

19:23.880 --> 19:25.830
Sarah and I used to go
to couples' counseling.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.830
And I used to look down on it --

19:27.830 --> 19:29.620
thought it was like paying
someone to be your friend,

19:29.620 --> 19:31.000
but I was wrong.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.920
It was helpful.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.120
Just, in our case,
not helpful enough.

19:39.620 --> 19:41.290
So, what, you think
less of me now?

19:41.290 --> 19:44.120
No. The opposite.

19:44.120 --> 19:46.830
I think anyone brave enough to
confront their problems head-on

19:46.830 --> 19:48.250
deserves respect.

19:57.080 --> 19:58.880
She's all set.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.500
We're gonna put a rush
on the tests.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.330
We should have results
in a few hours.

20:03.330 --> 20:06.170
I'm sorry about earlier.
I...

20:06.170 --> 20:07.710
I didn't know.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.170
It's okay.

20:09.170 --> 20:10.380
Thanks.

20:21.830 --> 20:23.750
Falling down
the WebMD rabbit hole

20:23.750 --> 20:25.170
isn't gonna change
your results.

20:25.170 --> 20:27.750
HIV is three times
more prevalent

20:27.750 --> 20:28.830
in the homeless community

20:28.830 --> 20:30.580
than it is
in the general population.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.420
Hepatitis is five times
more prevalent --

20:32.420 --> 20:34.170
And cows kill more people
a year than sharks.

20:34.170 --> 20:36.210
The facts are whatever
you make them.
What --

20:36.210 --> 20:37.830
What if I get hep C
from this needle,

20:37.830 --> 20:39.170
and one day I get shot,

20:39.170 --> 20:40.580
and you're trying
to stop the bleeding

20:40.580 --> 20:42.210
and you forget that, you know,
you have a --

20:42.210 --> 20:43.830
you have a cut on your hand?
Or worse --

20:43.830 --> 20:45.710
a kid gets shot
and I'm the one with the cut?

20:45.710 --> 20:49.580
And it's just --
Then you'll be a cop
with hep C and a cut.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.250
You signed up to put
your life on the line.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.330
That means
your health, too.

20:54.330 --> 20:56.210
Focusing on fear

20:56.210 --> 20:58.040
isn't gonna change
the outcome.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.000
Lab results
are gonna take hours.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.880
Do you want to hang out in the
worst-case-scenario panic room,

21:06.880 --> 21:09.040
or you want
to get back to work?

21:09.040 --> 21:11.080
Get that
air-conditioning fixed?

21:11.080 --> 21:14.960
I thought air-conditioning
made me soft.

21:14.960 --> 21:18.210
Well, it does, but I can't solve
all your problems today.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.380
Go splash some water
on your face.

21:22.380 --> 21:24.920
Let's get back out there.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.170
Okay.

21:40.210 --> 21:43.290
Just this apartment
and we're done.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.620
Can we kick it down?

21:47.620 --> 21:49.420
We have legal right.

21:49.420 --> 21:51.120
Let's check
with the neighbor first.

22:02.290 --> 22:03.540
Guess we're kicking it.

22:03.540 --> 22:06.210
-Wait. Do you hear that?

22:06.210 --> 22:08.880
-Ma'am?

22:08.880 --> 22:12.000
Ma'am, I'm Officer Angela Lopez.
I'm with the LAPD.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.830
Can you open the front door?

22:13.830 --> 22:17.210
Ruth:
I can't. I can't.

22:17.210 --> 22:20.170
Please, ma'am.
It would really help us out.

22:20.170 --> 22:23.290
Oh, I can't. The knots --

22:23.290 --> 22:25.540
Kick it down.

22:29.170 --> 22:31.500
Lopez: Take care of her.
I'll clear the apartment.

22:34.170 --> 22:35.710
Okay.
I'm Officer Jackson West.

22:35.710 --> 22:36.920
Can you tell me your name,
please?

22:36.920 --> 22:38.790
R-Ruth.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.670
Ruth. Okay, Ruth, I'm gonna
get you out of these.

22:40.670 --> 22:42.500
If you could just
stay calm for me.
Oh. No, no.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.670
-Clear.
-Please, no. No.

22:44.670 --> 22:47.330
Luke said
I had to stay here...

22:48.380 --> 22:51.170
Who's Luke, ma'am?
He's my son.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.170
Where is he?
Okay...

22:54.170 --> 22:56.460
What's going on?
What happened to my door?

22:56.460 --> 22:58.500
-Ohh.
-Are you Luke?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.460
-Yeah.
-You did this to your mother?

23:00.460 --> 23:02.040
So she won't hurt herself.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.540
She's in the early stages
of dementia.

23:04.540 --> 23:06.750
I had a job interview.
I couldn't take her with me.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.790
I got stuck in traffic
getting back.

23:08.790 --> 23:10.960
The damn V.P. --
If your mother
has health issues,

23:10.960 --> 23:12.460
then you need to get her
a caretaker.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.170
Or a neighbor to watch her.

23:14.170 --> 23:16.000
You know how much that costs?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.080
I do the best I can
with what I got.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.080
This is your mother.
What kind of garbage
treats his mom like --

23:20.080 --> 23:22.120
-Officer West!
-Oh...

23:22.120 --> 23:23.830
You're under arrest
for elder abuse.

23:23.830 --> 23:24.710
Hook him up.

23:27.830 --> 23:29.170
Oh, no, no! Don't do that!

23:29.170 --> 23:30.920
Oh, ma'am. It's okay.
It's all right, ma'am.

23:30.920 --> 23:31.920
No!

23:31.920 --> 23:34.420
Oh, my God.
It's okay, ma'am.

23:42.790 --> 23:45.620
You're gonna be fine.

23:52.290 --> 23:54.670
Sorry, I didn't realize
someone else was in here.

24:05.500 --> 24:08.500
Thanks.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.120
I'm sorry.

24:10.120 --> 24:13.170
It's just...

24:13.170 --> 24:16.170
my brother, he was...

24:16.170 --> 24:19.000
He was in a car accident.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
I'm sorry.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.040
Is he gonna be okay?

24:25.500 --> 24:26.750
No.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.830
Hey!

25:03.830 --> 25:05.170
What are you doing?

25:05.170 --> 25:06.830
This is what he wants.

25:06.830 --> 25:09.000
Stop.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.620
7-Adam-19, A to B,
Tim, I need you. Room 113.

25:15.620 --> 25:18.000
Hey. Hey. Look, just put down
the needle, okay?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.670
You don't need to do this.
Rachel: Yes, I do.

25:19.670 --> 25:21.330
My brother wouldn't want this.

25:21.330 --> 25:23.210
He ran triathlons.

25:23.210 --> 25:25.120
Being stuck in bed,
brain-dead,

25:25.120 --> 25:26.170
hooked up to machines forever,

25:26.170 --> 25:27.380
that's his idea of Hell.

25:27.380 --> 25:29.960
Okay. Listen to me.
Look, I know you're in pain,

25:29.960 --> 25:31.880
but this is not
your decision to make.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.170
Page a trauma surgeon
and get an O.R. on standby.

25:34.170 --> 25:36.380
Incoming gunshot wound.

25:36.380 --> 25:38.460
Please. Please.

25:38.460 --> 25:40.330
Mike never had a chance
to sign a DNR.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.540
He and my sister-in-law
got married six months ago.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.960
She's his medical proxy,
but she can't let him go.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.880
She doesn't see
that she's hurting him.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.830
And you think that injecting him
with bleach is better?

25:49.830 --> 25:52.710
Listen,
you have no right to decide

25:52.710 --> 25:54.670
if he lives or dies.

25:54.670 --> 25:56.250
What you're talking about
is murder.

25:56.250 --> 25:57.750
He's already dead.

25:57.750 --> 26:00.540
Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey,
put the needle down.

26:00.540 --> 26:02.080
Put it down.

26:02.080 --> 26:04.210
Hey. Look at me.
Right here. Right here.

26:04.210 --> 26:06.540
Put the needle down, okay?
No.

26:15.580 --> 26:18.540
Did she push the plunger?
No.

26:18.540 --> 26:20.120
Can't leave you alone
for a minute.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.710
Dispatch:
7-Adam-15, I'm reattaching you
to the motorcade detail.

26:34.710 --> 26:38.750
7-Adam-15, copy.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.080
Turn around.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.580
We've got to go
to Wilshire and Western.

26:41.580 --> 26:43.500
They're changing
the Vice President's route.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.000
So what does that mean
we have to do?

26:45.000 --> 26:47.290
Put out cones,
block off streets,

26:47.290 --> 26:49.500
check the area for any
suspicious activity.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.540
Isn't that what the department's
been doing all day?

26:51.540 --> 26:53.670
Yeah, but this is what happens
when the Vice President

26:53.670 --> 26:56.830
decides to stop at Philippe's
for a French Dip and a photo op.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.330
So basically, you're saying

26:58.330 --> 27:00.380
we have to clear out
a whole new section of town

27:00.380 --> 27:01.960
because he wants to stop
for a sandwich?

27:01.960 --> 27:03.750
Yep.

27:04.500 --> 27:06.580
You know, I've always liked it
when politicians stop

27:06.580 --> 27:08.380
at these little
mom-and-pop shops.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.460
It makes them
seem more human.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.750
But now...

27:12.750 --> 27:14.460
not so much.

27:18.330 --> 27:20.210
Last one.

27:20.210 --> 27:22.330
Do we need to track down the guy
that paid to have them put up?

27:22.330 --> 27:26.170
No. Situation's been remedied.
Detectives will follow up.

27:26.170 --> 27:29.170
You want to really tell me
what's going on?

27:29.170 --> 27:31.380
You've been distracted all day.
Losing control.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.460
That's not like you.

27:34.460 --> 27:36.210
My mom and I haven't spoken

27:36.210 --> 27:38.920
since before I, uh,
started the Academy.

27:38.920 --> 27:41.710
Breakfast was gonna be
my chance to change that.

27:41.710 --> 27:44.750
I, um, was up all night
worrying about it

27:44.750 --> 27:46.330
and finally got
in the right head space,

27:46.330 --> 27:47.670
only to get called
in to work.

27:47.670 --> 27:49.460
She's been married
to a cop for 30 years.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.920
She should know
how the job works.

27:50.920 --> 27:54.000
She does...but, um,
this is different.

27:54.000 --> 27:55.210
How so?

27:56.830 --> 27:59.170
It just is.

27:59.170 --> 28:01.880
Look, I know what it's like
to have family drama.

28:01.880 --> 28:04.420
But you have to keep it in check
when you're at work.

28:04.420 --> 28:05.960
In some ways,
it's even harder

28:05.960 --> 28:08.500
than not bringing this mess
home with you after shift.

28:08.500 --> 28:11.080
But being distracted on the job
will get you killed.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.120
I understand.
It won't happen again.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.500
-Officers Lopez, West?
-Yes?

28:18.500 --> 28:21.080
You're being reassigned
to counter-assault detail.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.330
Redwood has decided
to make a stop

28:22.330 --> 28:23.670
at the restaurant
across the street,

28:23.670 --> 28:26.250
so we have to clear
every apartment with a view.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.620
Grey's calling me back
to the station.

28:32.620 --> 28:34.170
Okay.
Should I come with you?

28:34.170 --> 28:36.210
No. You stay here,
wait for your results.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.500
I'll be back
when I'm done.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.000
Tim?

28:42.670 --> 28:44.000
Thanks.

28:46.250 --> 28:48.040
For what?

28:48.040 --> 28:49.830
Doing my job?

29:00.920 --> 29:02.960
How much time till
the motorcade passes through?

29:02.960 --> 29:04.790
20 minutes.

29:04.790 --> 29:07.290
7-Adam-15, new route
appears to be clear.

29:07.290 --> 29:09.040
Stand by
for final confirmation.

29:17.420 --> 29:18.920
Nolan,
take a glance to your right,

29:18.920 --> 29:21.040
tell me what you see.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.960
Car, single male occupant
sitting behind the wheel.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.750
Engine running.
What else?

29:25.750 --> 29:27.880
He's behind
the weed dispensary.

29:27.880 --> 29:29.380
And was that dispensary
open or closed

29:29.380 --> 29:30.830
when we drove past it
a minute ago?

29:30.830 --> 29:32.580
-Closed.
-Good.

29:32.580 --> 29:34.670
So why is a lone male
sitting in a running vehicle

29:34.670 --> 29:36.620
behind a closed business
that deals in cash?

29:38.620 --> 29:40.000
The store's being robbed.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.120
7-Adam-15, we have
a possible 4-5-9 in progress

29:48.120 --> 29:49.790
behind the Ganja Garden
dispensary.

29:49.790 --> 29:51.540
Requesting backup.

29:51.540 --> 29:53.040
Dispatch: Copy.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.080
Be advised backup is delayed
due to the road closures.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.670
What a surprise.

29:59.460 --> 30:01.290
The driver's gonna be
checking his mirror,

30:01.290 --> 30:02.920
so stay low
in the blind spot.

30:02.920 --> 30:05.080
We need to get to him before
he can alert his friends.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.710
Let's get behind
the dumpster.

30:28.540 --> 30:30.830
I'll get the driver.
Cover me.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.580
Police.
Give me your cellphone.

30:42.750 --> 30:44.250
Turn off the car.
Give me your keys.

30:46.920 --> 30:49.580
What's your name?
Freddy.

30:49.580 --> 30:51.460
You trying to rob
this place, Freddy?

30:51.460 --> 30:53.040
You got friends inside?

30:55.460 --> 30:56.960
I'm about to pull you
out of this car.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.670
Do not attempt
to warn them.

31:06.880 --> 31:08.330
Hands up.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.500
Gun.

31:16.670 --> 31:19.790
How many are inside?

31:19.790 --> 31:22.170
Your best shot at leniency
is to help us right now.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.540
-There's three people inside.
-Are they hardened felons

31:26.540 --> 31:27.830
or are they
just a bunch of stoners?

31:27.830 --> 31:29.540
Don and Tyreek
have done time.

31:29.540 --> 31:30.880
How long have they
been in there?
Five minutes?

31:30.880 --> 31:31.960
They said they'd be fast.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.000
You know,
just grab the cash and go.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.120
-Let's get out of here.
-Here we go.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.330
Police!

31:42.670 --> 31:44.210
Freddy!

31:44.210 --> 31:45.830
Freddy's down.
Get him.

31:48.380 --> 31:51.710
Come on.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.830
Nolan:
They got him in the neck.
Freddy looks bad.

31:53.830 --> 31:56.620
There's first aid
in the shop.

31:56.620 --> 31:59.790
Ready?

32:01.790 --> 32:04.420
Nolan:
7-Adam-15, we have shots fired.

32:04.420 --> 32:06.580
Dispatch: Need backup
and ambulance. Code 3.

32:06.580 --> 32:09.790
Copy. Be advised nearest backup
is 8 minutes away.

32:09.790 --> 32:12.460
8 minutes is a lifetime.
They're right around the corner.

32:12.460 --> 32:15.500
Agent Danvers? We're
getting a distress call
from one of our units.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.290
Do you have anyone
that can cover us?
No.

32:17.290 --> 32:19.380
The Vice President's motorcade
is passing through soon.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.290
You've got every window
in this building secured.

32:21.290 --> 32:23.250
We're redundant
standing around in a hallway.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.000
Our people are in a gunfight.
They need help.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.330
I don't care.

32:26.330 --> 32:28.880
I need you to stay
at your post.

32:41.210 --> 32:44.120
Remind me
to never do that again.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.460
How is he?
Not good.

33:00.250 --> 33:02.040
You okay?!

33:02.040 --> 33:03.670
I'm good! I'm good!

33:03.670 --> 33:05.420
We're gonna need
to get him to a hospital!

33:05.420 --> 33:07.380
We'll take him!
Backup's only a few minutes out!

33:08.750 --> 33:09.670
Go!

33:12.880 --> 33:14.750
Man:
Keep them pinned down!

33:14.750 --> 33:16.000
Nolan: Cover me.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.170
Come on! Get in here!

33:32.540 --> 33:34.330
Man: Move! Move! Shoot!

33:36.000 --> 33:38.500
They've gone back inside.
We go in after them?

33:38.500 --> 33:41.000
No. We make them
come to us.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.170
7-Adam-07,
let Shaw Memorial know

33:43.170 --> 33:45.170
that we are five minutes away
with a juvenile male,

33:45.170 --> 33:46.580
gunshot to the neck.

33:46.580 --> 33:47.830
Dispatch:
7-Adam-07, copy.

33:47.830 --> 33:49.460
They've been advised
and are ready.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.460
-We're still five out?
-At least.

33:51.460 --> 33:53.670
-You ready?
-Yep.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.170
-Hey! Get out of here!
-Hit 'em again.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.080
-Come on!
-Let's move!

34:03.080 --> 34:04.420
Nolan:
Get on the ground.

34:04.420 --> 34:06.170
Crawl toward the sound
of my voice.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.580
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Nice and easy.

34:12.000 --> 34:13.250
Okay! Okay.

34:16.420 --> 34:19.040
-How's he doing?
-He's losing consciousness.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.080
Pulse is increasing.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.000
Eyes already dilated.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.750
Elevate his legs,
monitor his breathing.

34:25.750 --> 34:27.880
Yo, what's going on?

34:27.880 --> 34:30.170
The traffic stopped
for the motorcade.
I can't get through.

34:44.380 --> 34:45.920
We can't move.

34:45.920 --> 34:47.710
I'm gonna reverse
and loop around Cahuenga.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.920
That's the opposite direction.
There's no time.

34:49.920 --> 34:52.080
Look, he's bleeding out.
We're just a block away.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.460
Hang on.

35:01.580 --> 35:05.120
He went into shock a minute ago.
Pulse is weak but steady.

35:21.670 --> 35:25.170
Hey,
what are you doing here?

35:25.170 --> 35:27.750
I got stuck with
a hypodermic needle
this morning,

35:27.750 --> 35:30.790
so now I'm just...

35:30.790 --> 35:32.120
I'm waiting.

35:35.830 --> 35:37.420
I, um...

35:37.420 --> 35:39.000
I can wait with you.

35:47.170 --> 35:48.920
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.790
Sergeant Grey, a word?

35:54.790 --> 35:56.120
Of course.

35:56.120 --> 35:57.670
Is Redwood wheels up?

35:57.670 --> 35:59.500
Yeah, heading back
to D.C. now.

35:59.500 --> 36:02.420
Look, earlier today,
I gave a direct order

36:02.420 --> 36:04.790
to two of your officers
that was disregarded.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.670
I'm aware.

36:06.670 --> 36:09.250
And I support
their decision.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.880
They abandoned a post

36:10.880 --> 36:13.080
that had a direct line of fire
on the Vice President.

36:13.080 --> 36:17.000
And you had snipers
with long guns set on that post.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.420
See, I train my people
to make educated decisions

36:19.420 --> 36:21.080
regarding threat assessment.

36:21.080 --> 36:22.670
My guys were under fire.

36:22.670 --> 36:25.670
Your guy?
Was going for a sandwich.

36:25.670 --> 36:27.170
It's a no-brainer.

36:39.710 --> 36:43.040
I've been here before.

36:43.040 --> 36:44.580
Waiting for news.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.670
Uh, before we started
the Academy,

36:48.670 --> 36:50.330
my, uh, brother, Marshall,

36:50.330 --> 36:52.500
was diagnosed
with diabetic nephropathy.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.750
It's a kidney disease.

36:54.750 --> 36:57.670
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

36:57.670 --> 36:59.500
Yeah. Now.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.920
But at the time,

37:00.920 --> 37:02.880
it looked like he needed
a kidney transplant,

37:02.880 --> 37:07.670
and I was the only one
in my family that was a match.

37:07.670 --> 37:09.960
That is a lot to carry.

37:09.960 --> 37:13.250
-Man, I was not ready for it.
-Mm-hmm.

37:13.250 --> 37:14.710
I'd been counting the days

37:14.710 --> 37:16.040
until I could start
the Academy,

37:16.040 --> 37:18.170
and suddenly,
I was facing the idea

37:18.170 --> 37:20.040
of putting it all on hold.

37:21.500 --> 37:24.540
I agonized over it.

37:24.540 --> 37:27.670
But Marshall said
that he could wait.

37:27.670 --> 37:29.670
That it really wasn't
that serious.

37:29.670 --> 37:33.380
So...I took the out.

37:33.380 --> 37:36.460
He was looking out
for you.

37:36.460 --> 37:39.880
He suffered
acute renal failure

37:39.880 --> 37:42.540
two months
after we started.

37:42.540 --> 37:44.000
He almost died.

37:44.000 --> 37:46.960
Whoa,
why didn't you tell us?

37:46.960 --> 37:49.120
I was ashamed.
I mean, it was my fault.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.830
I...

37:50.830 --> 37:53.040
Luckily, the hospital
found another donor

37:53.040 --> 37:55.540
and he got the transplant,

37:55.540 --> 37:58.420
but my mom
still hasn't forgiven me.

37:58.420 --> 38:01.460
Which is why missing brunch
was such a big deal.

38:01.460 --> 38:03.580
Yeah.

38:03.580 --> 38:04.880
And in her mind,

38:04.880 --> 38:07.380
I chose the job
before family.

38:07.380 --> 38:09.170
Again.

38:09.170 --> 38:11.250
It's not the same.

38:11.250 --> 38:12.960
It's not.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.420
Deep down
she knows it's true.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.250
Have you told her
how heartbroken you are

38:21.250 --> 38:22.670
about all of this?

38:25.330 --> 38:27.830
She hasn't really given me
the chance.

38:27.830 --> 38:30.500
Well, then take it.

38:30.500 --> 38:33.920
Trust me, as unpleasant
as it's gonna be,

38:33.920 --> 38:37.040
the waiting
is so much worse.

38:39.790 --> 38:42.790
-Officer Chen?
-Yeah, that's -- that's me.

38:42.790 --> 38:44.500
I have the results
of your test.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.830
So if you come with me,
we can set you up in a room.

38:46.830 --> 38:47.830
Uh, no. Sorry. No.

38:47.830 --> 38:50.000
Uh, can you just
tell me, like, now?

38:50.000 --> 38:52.120
Okay.

39:00.330 --> 39:03.380
So, your initial test

39:03.380 --> 39:05.790
came back negative
for any viral infections,

39:05.790 --> 39:08.080
like HIV or hepatitis.

39:11.880 --> 39:14.000
But...

39:14.000 --> 39:15.460
your blood work indicated

39:15.460 --> 39:16.880
the presence
of a staph infection.

39:16.880 --> 39:18.000
What does that mean?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.830
We need to get you started

39:19.830 --> 39:22.170
on intravenous antibiotics
immediately.

39:22.170 --> 39:25.330
Some strains of staph
are drug-resistant,

39:25.330 --> 39:26.670
so we'll monitor the wound

39:26.670 --> 39:28.880
for any abscesses
or cellulitis.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.380
Okay?
-Okay...

39:31.380 --> 39:34.000
Um, go.
I'll, uh -- I'll call Tim.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.170
He'll be here for you
when you come out.

39:35.170 --> 39:37.830
Thank you
for staying with me.

39:37.830 --> 39:39.040
Of course.

39:48.330 --> 39:50.500
Dispatch is sending another unit
to watch our suspect

39:50.500 --> 39:52.500
when he gets
out of surgery.

39:52.500 --> 39:55.330
Looks like getting puked on
saved your life.

39:55.330 --> 39:56.830
You don't put on
that tactical vest,

39:56.830 --> 39:58.880
that shot to the shoulder
goes through your heart.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.710
You've come a long way,
Officer West.

40:03.710 --> 40:08.040
I guess I have.
Thanks to you.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.670
Hey. Good job today.

40:15.670 --> 40:17.580
Are you being for real,
or are you just being positive?

40:17.580 --> 40:19.880
-For real.
-Thanks.

40:19.880 --> 40:22.040
What did you decide
about the loan from
your rich friend?

40:22.040 --> 40:23.960
Oh.
That you were right.

40:23.960 --> 40:27.210
Money and friendships
just don't mix.

40:27.210 --> 40:29.040
Look, your son is never
gonna forget that house.

40:29.040 --> 40:30.960
I moved around so much,

40:30.960 --> 40:33.330
I never had a place
that was special like that.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.210
But it's not about
the place,

40:35.210 --> 40:37.000
it's about
what happened there.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.790
You own those memories.

40:38.790 --> 40:42.330
That's actually...
an excellent perspective.

40:42.330 --> 40:44.290
Hmm.
I'll send you a bill.

40:47.330 --> 40:49.920
♪ Give it to you rougher ♪

40:53.330 --> 40:55.540
-All done?
-All done.

40:55.540 --> 40:59.170
The house is now in the hands
of a lovely young couple,

40:59.170 --> 41:00.790
their kids,
and a French bulldog.

41:00.790 --> 41:03.210
Well, I'm sure they'll take
good care of it.

41:03.210 --> 41:04.250
Yeah.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.790
Wow. What a day.

41:07.790 --> 41:10.290
Wait till
the President comes.

41:10.290 --> 41:13.080
I hear it's twice as bad.
That's not possible.

41:13.080 --> 41:15.920
Well, you missed
all the drama altogether.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.080
I got stuck
with a dirty needle.

41:18.080 --> 41:19.460
Yes, that's right,
I forgot.

41:19.460 --> 41:21.120
Tell me, is it too soon
to make jokes about that?

41:21.120 --> 41:23.540
-A little.
-Of course. That's my bad.

41:23.540 --> 41:25.170
-How about now?

41:25.170 --> 41:26.500
-Will you stop that?

41:26.500 --> 41:28.040
Ben: Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.
Hey.

41:28.040 --> 41:29.330
Just got off the flight
from Sedona.

41:29.330 --> 41:30.830
You know, I found this
outside the gate.

41:30.830 --> 41:32.500
I think it's for you.

41:32.500 --> 41:34.420
It's from Henry.

41:34.420 --> 41:36.000
If you would?
Mm-hmm.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.500
♪ A little love
would go a long way ♪

41:41.500 --> 41:44.790
It's the doorjamb...
from his room

41:44.790 --> 41:46.710
where I marked his height
every year.

41:46.710 --> 41:49.710
This is --
This is the best.

41:49.710 --> 41:51.670
Oh, my God, I can tear
a doorjamb down right here

41:51.670 --> 41:52.830
and I can install this.

41:52.830 --> 41:54.170
Um, did I mention
that this house

41:54.170 --> 41:56.120
is featured
in Architectural Digest?

41:56.120 --> 41:58.880
-Master bedroom.
-John. No.

41:58.880 --> 42:03.210
How about just a shadow box
to put it in?
