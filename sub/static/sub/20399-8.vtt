WEBVTT

00:06.306 --> 00:08.007
     - WE'RE HERE TO LOOK       

00:08.074 --> 00:09.541
  AT TWO VERY ICONIC WARRIORS   
         OF HISTORY--           

00:09.609 --> 00:11.877
        PANCHO VILLA...         

00:11.945 --> 00:13.779
      VERSUS CRAZY HORSE.       

00:13.847 --> 00:16.215
- WHENEVER I LOOK AT A MATCHUP, 
     I ALWAYS WANT TO LOOK      

00:16.282 --> 00:17.683
      AT THEIR PHYSIQUE,        

00:17.751 --> 00:20.419
  THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKEUP,   
          THEIR DIET.           

00:20.487 --> 00:22.721
         ALL OF THESE           
      ARE VERY IMPORTANT        

00:22.789 --> 00:24.857
 WHEN IT COMES TO TWO WARRIORS  
      CLOSELY MATCHED UP.       

00:24.924 --> 00:25.958
        - I THINK IT'S          
    A GREAT MATCHUP.            

00:26.026 --> 00:27.359
    YOU'VE GOT CRAZY HORSE.     

00:27.427 --> 00:29.661
  AMERICAN SETTLERS HAD MOVED   
      INTO HIS TERRITORY,       

00:29.729 --> 00:32.264
         AND IT LEADS           
    TO A FLAT-OUT WAR           

00:32.332 --> 00:34.500
BETWEEN HIM AND THE U.S. ARMY.  

00:34.567 --> 00:36.869
- WHEN YOU LOOK AT PANCHO VILLA,
        HE WAS A BANDIT         

00:36.936 --> 00:38.504
  WHO HAD TO BUILD HIMSELF UP   
         FROM NOTHING           

00:38.571 --> 00:41.073
      AND THEN COLLECTED        
  THIS INCREDIBLE FOLLOWING.    

00:41.141 --> 00:43.642
  TWO OF THE MOST WANTED MEN    
         IN HISTORY--           

00:43.710 --> 00:46.845
      AND THAT'S WHY THIS       
     IS A PERFECT MATCHUP.      

00:46.913 --> 00:48.680
         - [whooping]           
        - CRAZY HORSE,          

00:48.748 --> 00:51.550
THE FIERCE LAKOTA WARRIOR       
         OF THE 1870s           

00:51.618 --> 00:54.520
 WHOSE BRILLIANT BATTLE PLANS   
    AND FEARLESS OFFENSIVES     

00:54.587 --> 00:58.524
  ANNIHILATED GENERAL CUSTER    
      AT LITTLE BIGHORN,        

00:58.591 --> 01:00.159
     VERSUS PANCHO VILLA,       

01:00.226 --> 01:02.694
THE MEXICAN REVOLUTIONARY       

01:02.762 --> 01:05.263
WHOSE GUERRILLA ARMY DESTROYED  
    CORRUPT DICTATORS           

01:05.331 --> 01:06.732
IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY       

01:06.800 --> 01:10.069
    AND THEN INVADED            
      THE UNITED STATES.        

01:13.773 --> 01:16.475
         TO FIND OUT,           
      THE HISTORY OF WAR        

01:16.543 --> 01:18.577
  AND MODERN SCIENCE COLLIDE,   

01:18.645 --> 01:21.413
      AS FORMER NAVY SEAL       
RICHARD "MACK" MACHOWICZ        

01:21.481 --> 01:23.715
  DIVES DEEP INTO THE TACTICS   
        OF THE WARRIORS         

01:23.783 --> 01:25.017
      BEHIND THE WEAPONS.       

01:25.085 --> 01:27.920
      BIOMEDICAL ENGINEER       
        GEOFF DESMOULIN         

01:27.987 --> 01:30.489
APPLIES 21ST-CENTURY TECHNOLOGY 

01:30.557 --> 01:33.692
      TO UNLOCK NEW DATA        
ON ARSENALS OF THE PAST.        

01:33.760 --> 01:36.328
      AND E.R. PHYSICIAN        
         ARMAND DORIAN          

01:36.396 --> 01:38.097
      DISSECTS THE TRAUMA       

01:38.164 --> 01:41.066
AND REVEALS THE PHYSICAL        
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAITS        

01:41.134 --> 01:43.502
THAT SHAPED THESE LEGENDS       
            OF WAR.             

01:43.570 --> 01:44.937
THIS GROUNDBREAKING DATA        

01:45.004 --> 01:47.806
        WILL BE PAIRED          
WITH HISTORICAL RESEARCH        

01:47.874 --> 01:50.509
  AND ENTERED INTO AN ALL-NEW   
    DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE.      

01:50.577 --> 01:52.578
TWO LEGENDARY COMBATANTS        
     WILL BE RESURRECTED.       

01:52.645 --> 01:54.746
  HISTORY WILL BE REWRITTEN.    

01:54.814 --> 01:59.685
 BUT ONLY ONE WILL BE CROWNED   
      DEADLIEST WARRIOR.        

02:01.888 --> 02:04.189
WELCOME TO THE HIGH-TECH        
         BATTLE ZONE.           

02:04.257 --> 02:06.859
      OUR EXPERTS PREPARE       
     TO UNLOCK NEW TRUTHS       

02:06.926 --> 02:10.762
      TO DETERMINE WHICH        
FREEDOM FIGHTER IS DEADLIEST--  

02:10.830 --> 02:12.030
         CRAZY HORSE,           

02:12.098 --> 02:14.233
     WHO FOUGHT TO PROTECT      
    THE LAKOTA NATION           

02:14.300 --> 02:16.869
      FROM EXTERMINATION        
     BY THE U.S. CAVALRY,       

02:16.936 --> 02:18.337
    OR PANCHO VILLA,            

02:18.404 --> 02:21.840
        THE ROBIN HOOD          
  OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION,    

02:21.908 --> 02:23.342
        WHO WENT                
    FROM SMALL-TOWN BANDIT      

02:23.409 --> 02:27.112
TO LEADER OF A 40,000-MAN       
          REBEL ARMY.           

02:27.180 --> 02:29.348
        - FOR ME,               
EVERY MATCH HAS TO START        

02:29.415 --> 02:31.083
  WITH THE TALE OF THE TAPE--   

02:31.151 --> 02:33.919
      AGE, SIZE, WEIGHT,        
 ILLNESSES THAT THEY MAY HAVE.  

02:33.987 --> 02:37.656
         PANCHO VILLA,          
      5'10", 170 POUNDS.        

02:37.724 --> 02:39.758
         CRAZY HORSE,           
      ON THE OTHER HAND,        

02:39.826 --> 02:41.827
    5'8", 140 POUNDS.           

02:41.895 --> 02:43.262
    THEN YOU THINK ABOUT--      

02:43.329 --> 02:45.531
         PANCHO VILLA           
HAD RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,       

02:45.598 --> 02:47.299
          A SEVERELY            
     DEBILITATING DISEASE.      

02:47.367 --> 02:49.001
         CRAZY HORSE,           
      ON THE OTHER HAND--       

02:49.068 --> 02:51.770
 DURING HIS REIGN, THE BUFFALO  
    ALMOST BECAME EXTINCT.      

02:51.838 --> 02:53.038
  HIS FOOD SUPPLY DIMINISHED.   

02:53.106 --> 02:55.574
HE BECAME EXTREMELY THIN.       

02:55.642 --> 02:57.109
    AND THESE ARE ALL           
      CRUCIAL "X" FACTORS       

02:57.177 --> 02:58.610
 THAT'LL BE PUT INTO THE SIM.   

02:58.678 --> 03:00.779
    - FOR ME, THOUGH,           
    IT'S THE WARRIOR.           

03:00.847 --> 03:03.048
WHAT IS THE STRATEGY AND TACTICS
        THEY LIKE BEST?         

03:03.116 --> 03:04.583
HOW IS THEIR FIELD CRAFT?       

03:04.651 --> 03:06.218
    WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING      

03:06.286 --> 03:07.719
    AT CRAZY HORSE'S            
      HIT-AND-RUN TACTIC        

03:07.787 --> 03:10.756
    AGAINST PANCHO VILLA'S      
      <i>EL GOLPE TERRIFICO.</i>       

03:10.823 --> 03:12.424
- MACK, MOST INTERESTING        
ABOUT THIS MATCHUP FOR ME       

03:12.492 --> 03:13.759
IS THE REPEATING RIFLES.        

03:13.826 --> 03:16.261
     YOU'RE ABLE TO CARRY       
         MORE ROUNDS,           

03:16.329 --> 03:19.364
SPEEDING UP YOUR ABILITY        
TO SEND ROUNDS DOWNRANGE.       

03:19.432 --> 03:21.967
WE'RE GONNA SEE JUST HOW LETHAL 
     THESE WEAPONS CAN BE.      

03:22.035 --> 03:25.637
- THE NEW DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE 
          WAS CREATED           

03:25.705 --> 03:27.639
        BY ROBERT DALY,         
     A FORMER GREEN BERET       

03:27.707 --> 03:32.044
AND DESIGNER OF MORE THAN       
30 MILITARY-BASED VIDEO GAMES,  

03:32.111 --> 03:34.947
        INCLUDING               
  THE <i>DEADLIEST WARRIOR</i> GAME.   

03:35.014 --> 03:37.216
    THE COMBAT ENGINE           
  WILL EVALUATE WEAPONS DATA,   

03:37.283 --> 03:41.253
  PLUS UP TO 100 "X" FACTORS    
THAT ARE ASSIGNED VALUES        

03:41.321 --> 03:43.722
      BASED ON EXTENSIVE        
      HISTORICAL RESEARCH       

03:43.790 --> 03:45.624
    OF EACH WARRIOR'S LIFE,     
        TACTICS,                

03:45.692 --> 03:47.859
  AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE.    

03:47.927 --> 03:49.161
      - WHAT "X" FACTORS        
        ARE GONNA MAKE          

03:49.229 --> 03:51.163
THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE TO YOU?  

03:51.231 --> 03:52.864
- THE LOGISTICS THAT BOTH       
     OF THESE WARRIORS HAD      

03:52.932 --> 03:54.766
    IS SOMETHING THAT COMES     
          INTO PLAY,            

03:54.834 --> 03:56.735
  LOGISTICS BEING THE SUPPLY    
    OF THE OPERATION.           

03:56.803 --> 03:59.638
WHEN YOU'RE LIMITED ON SUPPLIES,
      YOU HAVE AN ISSUE.        

03:59.706 --> 04:02.407
  - REPRESENTING CRAZY HORSE,   

04:02.475 --> 04:03.775
     HIS DIRECT DESCENDANT      

04:03.843 --> 04:06.511
AND AN EXPERT AT WIELDING       
    WEAPONS FROM HORSEBACK,     

04:06.579 --> 04:09.281
     MOSES BRINGS PLENTY.       

04:09.349 --> 04:12.951
 - CRAZY HORSE WOULD ALWAYS BE  
  THE FIRST ONE INTO BATTLE.    

04:13.019 --> 04:15.687
AND CRAZY HORSE WOULD ALWAYS BE 
    THE LAST ONE TO LEAVE.      

04:15.755 --> 04:19.658
     - JOINING THE FIGHT,       
    LAKOTA TRIBESMAN            

04:19.726 --> 04:24.529
  AND DECORATED FORMER MARINE   
      DELANO "BLU" EAGLE.       

04:24.597 --> 04:25.964
- CRAZY HORSE IS FIGHTING       
     TO PROTECT HIS PEOPLE      

04:26.032 --> 04:27.132
     AND HIS WAY OF LIFE.       

04:27.200 --> 04:29.301
     AND NOTHING GIVES YOU      
        MORE STRENGTH.          

04:29.369 --> 04:31.870
HE WAS BORN FOR WARFARE.        

04:31.938 --> 04:34.072
     - CRAZY HORSE GREW UP      

04:34.140 --> 04:37.009
          AS SETTLERS           
AND GREAT PLAINS INDIAN TRIBES  

04:37.076 --> 04:38.710
     FOUGHT FOR TERRITORY.      

04:38.778 --> 04:41.647
      WHEN THE U.S. ARMY        
    SLAUGHTERED 85 INDIANS      

04:41.714 --> 04:45.584
  AT THE BLUE WATER MASSACRE    
      IN SEPTEMBER 1855,        

04:45.652 --> 04:49.554
    15-YEAR-OLD CRAZY HORSE     
    DISCOVERED THE CARNAGE.     

04:49.622 --> 04:50.822
     AND IN THAT MOMENT...      

04:50.890 --> 04:53.792
          - [screams]           
- AN AVENGING WARRIOR WAS BORN. 

04:53.860 --> 04:56.762
- IT COMPLETELY BROKE HIM       
         ON THE INSIDE          

04:56.829 --> 05:00.866
  HOW SAVAGE THESE STRANGERS    
     CAN BE TO HIS PEOPLE.      

05:00.933 --> 05:02.668
        AND AFTER THAT,         
    THERE WAS NO WAY            

05:02.735 --> 05:04.503
      TO STOP CRAZY HORSE       
        FROM WAGING WAR         

05:04.570 --> 05:05.570
    ON THE BLUECOATS.           

05:05.638 --> 05:07.172
- THOUGH THE U.S. CAVALRY       

05:07.240 --> 05:09.941
        WAS MUCH LARGER         
    AND BETTER ARMED,           

05:10.009 --> 05:13.011
    CRAZY HORSE'S EVOLVING      
      HIT-AND-RUN TACTICS       

05:13.079 --> 05:16.181
      LEFT A BLOODY TRAIL       
    OF SOLDIERS BEHIND HIM.     

05:16.249 --> 05:18.450
    - EARLY SETTLERS            
    WERE USED TO FORMING UP     

05:18.518 --> 05:19.584
        ON TWO COLUMNS          

05:19.652 --> 05:21.253
    AND JUST BLASTING AWAY      
        AT EACH OTHER.          

05:21.321 --> 05:22.854
    THAT WAS THEIR VERSION      
            OF WAR.             

05:22.922 --> 05:24.556
    BUT LAKOTAS ARE SMART.      

05:24.624 --> 05:27.693
 INSTEAD, THEY'RE GONNA HIDE,   
         MOVE IN FAST,          

05:27.760 --> 05:29.394
    HIT YOU WHEN YOU LEAST      
          SUSPECT IT.           

05:29.462 --> 05:31.129
     [gunshot, war cries]       

05:31.197 --> 05:32.931
  AND AS THEY'RE TAKING OFF,    
    ANOTHER GROUP IS COMING     

05:32.999 --> 05:35.200
        FROM THIS SIDE          
  TO DO THE EXACT SAME THING.   

05:35.268 --> 05:36.635
    TOTAL CONFUSION.            

05:36.703 --> 05:39.438
    - THE GUERRILLA WARFARE     
          INNOVATOR,            

05:39.505 --> 05:41.406
 CRAZY HORSE, EARNED HIS PLACE  
    IN COMBAT HISTORY           

05:41.474 --> 05:43.775
        WHEN, IN 1876,          

05:43.843 --> 05:46.311
    HE GAVE GENERAL CUSTER      
        HIS LAST STAND          

05:46.379 --> 05:48.947
      AT LITTLE BIGHORN.        

05:49.015 --> 05:51.416
     CAN CRAZY HORSE CRUSH      
    ANOTHER FREEDOM FIGHTER     

05:51.484 --> 05:52.884
FROM THE SAME CONTINENT?        

05:52.952 --> 05:54.019
        [gunshot]               

05:54.087 --> 05:55.520
         PANCHO VILLA,          

05:55.588 --> 05:57.556
    THE 20TH-CENTURY            
        MILITARY GENIUS         

05:57.623 --> 05:58.790
  OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION,    

05:58.858 --> 06:01.460
     WHOSE INNOVATIVE USE

06:01.527 --> 06:03.695
  AND DEVOTED PEASANT MASSES    

06:03.763 --> 06:06.131
     DEFEATED MUCH LARGER       
      GOVERNMENT ARMIES.        

06:06.199 --> 06:08.467
  [men shouting and groaning]   

06:08.534 --> 06:10.569
    CARRYING THE FLAG           
    FOR PANCHO VILLA,

    FERNANDO VAZQUEZ.           

06:17.543 --> 06:20.112
    - THE PEOPLE THAT HATED     
         PANCHO VILLA           

06:20.179 --> 06:22.214
  WERE THOSE THAT WERE AFRAID   
            OF HIM.             

06:22.281 --> 06:25.317
    THE THING IS THAT           
     MORE PEOPLE LOVED HIM      

06:25.385 --> 06:26.351
        THAN HATED HIM.         

06:26.419 --> 06:28.253
  HIS STRATEGY, HIS INTELLECT   

06:28.321 --> 06:30.555
        MAKE HIM                
    THE DEADLIEST WARRIOR.      

06:30.623 --> 06:33.091
      - JOINING FERNANDO,       

06:33.159 --> 06:35.360
  EARLY-20TH-CENTURY-FIREARMS   
            EXPERT              

06:35.428 --> 06:37.763
      AND GREAT-GRANDSON        
  OF ONE OF VILLA'S GENERALS,   

06:37.830 --> 06:42.534
     SANTIAGO VILLALOBOS.       

06:42.602 --> 06:44.436
        - PANCHO VILLA,         
    TO THE MEXICAN PEOPLE,      

06:44.504 --> 06:47.172
        IS KNOWN                
  AS THE MEXICAN ROBIN HOOD.    

06:47.240 --> 06:50.942
HE'D TAKE ALL THE RICHES        
FROM THE RICH LANDOWNERS,       

06:51.010 --> 06:52.878
      AND HE'D MAKE THEM        
     SIGN EVERYTHING OVER       

06:52.945 --> 06:54.846
    TO THE PEASANTS.            

06:54.914 --> 06:57.349
         - GROWING UP           
      AN INDENTURED PEON        

06:57.417 --> 06:59.117
    ON A MEXICAN HACIENDA,      

06:59.185 --> 07:01.953
         PANCHO'S RAGE          
      AGAINST THE WEALTHY       

07:02.021 --> 07:03.722
  WAS IGNITED WHEN HIS SISTER   
         WAS ASSAULTED          

07:03.790 --> 07:05.323
    BY THE RICH LANDOWNER.      

07:05.391 --> 07:07.159
          - [crying]            
        NO, PANCHO, NO.         

07:07.226 --> 07:08.827
     - WHAT SET HIM APART       

07:08.895 --> 07:10.862
    WAS THAT HE SAID,           
        "THIS IS WRONG.         

07:10.930 --> 07:12.364
  "I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE.    

07:12.432 --> 07:13.865
    "YOU MAY BE RICH.           
     YOU MAY BE POWERFUL.       

07:13.933 --> 07:15.167
"BUT YOU ARE DOING WRONG,       

07:15.234 --> 07:17.102
     AND I'M GONNA CORRECT      
         THAT WRONG."           

07:17.170 --> 07:19.771
         [man screams]          

07:19.839 --> 07:23.008
      - LIKE CRAZY HORSE,       
    THIS CHILDHOOD TRAGEDY      

07:23.075 --> 07:26.545
        CATAPULTED HIM          
    TO A LIFE OF WAR.           

07:26.612 --> 07:29.915
      WHEN MEXICO ERUPTED       
  IN REVOLT AGAINST DICTATORS   

07:29.982 --> 07:31.750
        IN 1910,                

07:31.818 --> 07:33.452
        VILLA ORGANIZED         
    ORDINARY PEASANTS           

07:33.519 --> 07:35.854
INTO A DEADLY REBEL ARMY.       

07:35.922 --> 07:37.556
- WHAT MADE PANCHO VILLA        
    A GREAT WARRIOR,            

07:37.623 --> 07:38.824
    THAT HE WAS RELENTLESS,     

07:38.891 --> 07:42.127
    HE WOULD NOT STOP           
      UNTIL THE DICTATORS       

07:42.195 --> 07:44.429
      WERE OUT OF <i>MEXICO.</i>       

07:44.497 --> 07:45.897
    - AS A SCIENTIST,           

07:45.965 --> 07:47.699
    I REALLY LOVE THE FACT      
    THAT WE'RE HITTING THIS     

07:47.767 --> 07:48.800
    FROM ALL ANGLES.            

07:48.868 --> 07:50.702
          AND TO ME,            
    THE MORE DATA YOU HAVE,     

07:50.770 --> 07:52.637
    THE MORE ACCURATE           
      THE SIM'S GONNA BE.       

07:52.705 --> 07:54.072
  - THE TRUTH IS RIGHT THERE.   

07:54.140 --> 07:55.407
- SO WHAT ARE WE MISSING?       

07:55.475 --> 07:57.142
         THE HARD DATA          
    OFF THE WEAPONS.            

07:57.210 --> 07:58.410
    LET'S GET TO IT.            

07:58.478 --> 08:01.012
     - THESE TWO WILD WEST      
    FREEDOM FIGHTERS            

08:01.080 --> 08:03.949
        KICK OFF                
    THIS HISTORIC SHOWDOWN      

08:04.016 --> 08:07.085
WITH THE BEST LONG-RANGE        
 FIREPOWER ON THE FRONTIER...   

08:07.153 --> 08:09.521
     THE REPEATING RIFLE.       

08:09.589 --> 08:11.089
     WHEN CRAZY HORSE SAW       

08:11.157 --> 08:13.291
     THE DEADLY ADVANTAGE       
         OF FIREARMS,           

08:13.359 --> 08:14.693
      HE QUICKLY REPLACED       
 THE TRADITIONAL BOW AND ARROW  

08:14.760 --> 08:17.896
     WITH THE 1860 HENRY--      

08:17.964 --> 08:20.065
     A WEAPON SO PROLIFIC,      

08:20.132 --> 08:22.501
A SECTION OF THE LITTLE BIGHORN 
          BATTLEFIELD           

08:22.568 --> 08:24.035
         BECAME KNOWN           
        AS HENRY HILL.          

08:24.103 --> 08:26.738
    - REPEATING RIFLES ARE      
A BIG JUMP IN TECHNOLOGY.       

08:26.806 --> 08:28.240
I MEAN, ALL OF A SUDDEN,        
      YOU'RE NOT LOADING        

08:28.307 --> 08:29.708
      ONE ROUND AT A TIME       
     AND SHOOTING IT OFF.       

08:29.775 --> 08:31.943
  NOW YOU'VE GOT MORE ROUNDS    
        AND MAGAZINES.          

08:32.010 --> 08:34.011
    NOW YOU GOT MORE ROUNDS     
      TO THROW DOWNRANGE.       

08:34.080 --> 08:36.280
        MOSES, TELL ME          
    ABOUT YOUR HENRY.           

08:36.349 --> 08:37.816
      - HOLDS 15 ROUNDS.        

08:37.884 --> 08:40.619
    UNION SOLDIERS CARRIED      
        THIS 1860 HENRY         

08:40.686 --> 08:42.254
      INTO THE CIVIL WAR.       

08:42.321 --> 08:43.621
 AND THE CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS   
          WOULD SAY,            

08:43.688 --> 08:45.223
    "THAT DAMN YANKEE GUN--     

08:45.291 --> 08:48.560
 THEY WOULD LOAD IT ON SUNDAY   
  AND SHOOT AT US ALL WEEK."    

08:51.831 --> 08:53.465
     - IT WAS THIS BARRAGE      
          OF BULLETS            

08:53.533 --> 08:55.367
  THAT MADE REPEATING RIFLES    
         SO EFFECTIVE           

08:55.434 --> 08:57.402
    IN HIT-AND-RUN TACTICS.     

08:57.470 --> 09:00.005
TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR FIREPOWER, 

09:00.072 --> 09:01.940
    FOUR TARGETS ARE SET UP     
        50 YARDS AWAY--         

09:02.008 --> 09:05.110
  THE MINIMUM EFFECTIVE RANGE   
    OF THESE RIFLES.            

09:05.177 --> 09:06.511
    - LET'S DO THIS.            
        - WE GOT THIS.          

09:06.579 --> 09:08.780
    - THE TEST WILL MEASURE     
      THE HIT PERCENTAGE        

09:08.848 --> 09:10.515
OF EACH RIFLE'S MAGAZINE.       

09:10.583 --> 09:12.450
    SPEED IS ALSO A FACTOR.     

09:12.518 --> 09:14.386
      MOSES WILL BE TIMED       

09:14.453 --> 09:17.956
TO SEE HOW MANY OF HIS 15 ROUNDS
     WILL HIT THE TARGETS?      

09:18.024 --> 09:20.926
      - THREE, TWO, ONE.        

09:20.993 --> 09:21.960
              GO!               

09:22.028 --> 09:23.562
            - NICE.             
            - NICE.             

09:23.629 --> 09:24.796
          - NICE ONE.           

09:24.864 --> 09:26.431
             - OH.              
     - THERE'S A GOOD HIT.      

09:26.499 --> 09:28.133
            - NICE.             

09:35.107 --> 09:38.176
          NICE. NICE!           

09:38.244 --> 09:40.645
        - ARE YOU DONE?         
        - KEEP FIRING.          

09:40.713 --> 09:41.813
    IF YOU GOT MORE ROUNDS,     
        FIRE 'EM.               

09:41.881 --> 09:45.283
- NOPE, STILL GOT MORE ROUNDS.  

09:45.351 --> 09:47.619
        - IT'S JAMMED.          
        - JAMMED.               

09:47.687 --> 09:49.020
        [gunshot]               
            - NICE.             

09:49.088 --> 09:50.388
        - THERE YOU GO.         
        THAT WAS A HIT.         

09:50.456 --> 09:51.690
        BRING IT HOME.          
        BRING IT HOME.          

09:51.757 --> 09:52.991
            - DONE!             

09:53.059 --> 09:55.026
        - OKAY, MOSES,          
 THAT WAS 1 MINUTE, 15 SECONDS  

09:55.094 --> 09:57.862
          TO GET OFF            
    THOSE 15 ROUNDS, OKAY?      

09:57.930 --> 09:59.364
  LET'S CHECK OUT THE DAMAGE.   

09:59.432 --> 10:02.233
  - THIS IS WHERE YOUR AORTA    
  SPLITS OFF TO YOUR KIDNEYS.   

10:02.301 --> 10:03.735
 YOU HIT THOSE RENAL ARTERIES.  

10:03.803 --> 10:04.970
    WHEN THOSE BLEED,           

10:05.037 --> 10:06.605
     YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE'S      
          GONNA DROP.           

10:06.672 --> 10:07.906
    AND THAT WILL BE            
    AN INSTANT KILL.            

10:07.974 --> 10:10.942
    - TARGETS TWO AND THREE     
     ARE SEVERELY WOUNDED,      

10:11.010 --> 10:12.644
  BUT COULD STILL FIRE BACK.    

10:12.712 --> 10:14.179
    - SLAB OF MEAT--            

10:14.246 --> 10:15.780
     THIS WOULD CLEANLY GO      
     THROUGH A HUMAN BODY.      

10:15.848 --> 10:17.082
PERHAPS NOT A KILL SHOT.        

10:17.149 --> 10:18.984
    IF IT WAS CHEST LEVEL,      
THIS IS AN INSTANT KILL.        

10:19.051 --> 10:21.820
- MOSES, WHAT WORRIES ME        
        ABOUT THIS TEST         

10:21.887 --> 10:23.722
     IS THERE'S 15 ROUNDS       
        IN THAT HENRY,          

10:23.789 --> 10:25.156
     AND WE'RE ONLY SEEING      
            6 HITS.             

10:25.224 --> 10:26.524
        WHAT HAPPENED?          

10:26.592 --> 10:29.127
     - AH, FOUR TARGETS--       
ALL FOUR OF 'EM ARE HIT.        

10:29.195 --> 10:31.963
  THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME,    
    AS LONG AS WE STOP 'EM.     

10:32.031 --> 10:34.766
- THAT GUN IS SUSCEPTIBLE       
          TO JAMMING.           

10:34.834 --> 10:37.502
 I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS ONE  
      WILL JAM AS EASILY.       

10:37.570 --> 10:40.305
        - PANCHO VILLA          
        STAKED HIS LIFE         

10:40.373 --> 10:43.008
ON THE 1894 MODEL WINCHESTER--  

10:43.075 --> 10:45.276
    A REPEATING RIFLE           
          SO LETHAL,            

10:45.344 --> 10:47.779
         IT'S KNOWN AS          
  THE GUN THAT WON THE WEST.    

10:47.847 --> 10:51.916
 - EVEN THOUGH IT DID NOT FIRE  
  THE 15 ROUNDS--IT WAS 10--    

10:51.984 --> 10:55.053
  THIS ACTION COULD TAKE HIM    
        THROUGH FASTER,         

10:55.121 --> 10:57.255
          MUCH EASIER           
     THAN THE OTHER RIFLE.      

10:57.323 --> 11:00.425
    - WITH A MAGAZINE           
        OF TEN ROUNDS,          

11:00.493 --> 11:02.694
  FERNANDO WILL HAVE TO SCORE   
      MORE THAN FOUR HITS       

11:02.762 --> 11:05.130
        TO BEAT MOSES'          
    40% SUCCESS RATE.           

11:05.197 --> 11:06.331
        - <i>ORALE!</i>                

11:06.399 --> 11:08.867
            - WHOO!             

11:14.440 --> 11:17.142
        - OH, YEAH, ONE         
IN THE BELLY THERE, YEAH.       

11:17.209 --> 11:18.343
        - <i>ESO, CARNAL!</i>          

11:18.411 --> 11:21.112
             <i>PONLE!</i>             

11:21.180 --> 11:22.280
              <i>SI!</i>               

11:22.348 --> 11:23.381
    - KNOCK 'EM DOWN.           
        KNOCK 'EM DOWN.         

11:23.449 --> 11:26.084
         - [laughing]           

11:28.621 --> 11:30.422
            - DONE.             
            - NICE!             

11:30.489 --> 11:33.458
THAT'S 48 SECONDS TO GET THOSE  
     TEN ROUNDS DOWNRANGE.      

11:33.526 --> 11:34.659
     NICE WORK, FERNANDO.       

11:34.727 --> 11:36.528
      LET'S GO CHECK OUT        
         THE TARGETS.           

11:36.595 --> 11:39.798
 - THIS IS DESCRIBED AS A WAY   
         TO DECAPITATE          

11:39.865 --> 11:40.865
        WITH A BULLET.          

11:40.933 --> 11:42.233
 THIS GUY IS INSTANTLY KILLED.  

11:42.301 --> 11:44.302
  - LIKE CRAZY HORSE'S RIFLE,   

11:44.370 --> 11:47.138
     TARGETS TWO AND THREE      
    ARE NOT INSTANT KILLS.      

11:47.206 --> 11:48.840
        - I CAN SEE IT          
      FROM HERE ALREADY--       

11:48.908 --> 11:50.075
        THE EXIT WOUND.         

11:50.142 --> 11:51.543
      YOU SEE THAT RING,        
      SIZE OF THE BULLET,       

11:51.610 --> 11:52.644
      THE BURN AROUND IT.       

11:52.712 --> 11:54.012
IT GOES THROUGH ALL THE LAYERS, 

11:54.080 --> 11:57.015
    BUT THE BACK END,           
 YOU GET A MUCH LARGER WOUND.   

11:57.083 --> 11:59.451
 THIS WOULD BE A MORTAL WOUND,  
     NOT AN INSTANT KILL,       

11:59.518 --> 12:03.421
BUT IT IS REALLY NICE TO LOOK AT
    ON ACTUAL TISSUE.           

12:03.489 --> 12:06.257
    - SO ONE INSTANT KILL,      
     THREE MORTAL WOUNDS.       

12:06.325 --> 12:08.126
    BUT I GOT TO SAY, MAN,      
        ONLY FOUR HITS.         

12:08.194 --> 12:11.329
- TEN ROUNDS, FOUR HITS--       
    THAT'S STILL 40%.           

12:11.397 --> 12:13.498
  - THERE'S A REASON WHY THEY   
 STILL MAKE THIS WEAPON TODAY.  

12:13.566 --> 12:14.899
    IT'S STILL BEING MADE.      

12:14.967 --> 12:16.201
  IF YOU EVER GO INTO BATTLE,   

12:16.268 --> 12:18.036
      THIS IS THE WEAPON        
    TO TAKE WITH YOU.           

12:18.104 --> 12:19.337
    - BUT, YOU KNOW,            
    DURING THAT TIME,           

12:19.405 --> 12:21.339
    DISEASE ACTUALLY KILLED     
          MORE PEOPLE           

12:21.407 --> 12:23.541
        THAN EITHER ONE         
    OF THESE RIFLES,            

12:23.609 --> 12:25.777
 WHICH HAS TO COME INTO FACTOR  
      AND COME INTO PLAY.       

12:25.845 --> 12:26.978
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG.        

12:27.046 --> 12:29.280
    CRAZY HORSE JUST MISSED     
    THE BIG EPIDEMIC            

12:29.348 --> 12:31.149
  WITH REGARDS TO SMALLPOX...   
        - MM-HMM.               

12:31.217 --> 12:32.550
- AND THEN TUBERCULOSIS.        

12:32.618 --> 12:35.120
  YOU WANT TO BE INEFFECTIVE    
      IN THE BATTLEFIELD?       

12:35.187 --> 12:37.122
 TRY FIGHTING WHEN YOUR LUNGS   
  ARE FILLING UP WITH BLOOD.    

12:37.189 --> 12:39.224
 - FOR ME, WHAT REALLY MATTERS  
    IN THESE KIND OF TESTS      

12:39.291 --> 12:40.959
  IS PRECISION AND LETHALITY.   

12:41.026 --> 12:42.660
    SO WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING      
      AT THIS RIGHT NOW,        

12:42.728 --> 12:43.928
     AS FAR AS PRECISION,       

12:43.996 --> 12:45.130
  IT'S KIND OF A WASH, RIGHT?   

12:45.197 --> 12:46.731
SO IT'S REALLY GONNA COME DOWN  

12:46.799 --> 12:48.733
      TO HOW THE WEAPONS        
      THEMSELVES OPERATE,       

12:48.801 --> 12:51.569
HOW QUICKLY YOU CAN GET ONLINE, 
     AND HOW YOU DO THAT.       

12:51.637 --> 12:54.038
- I'M CONVINCED THAT THIS       
IS STILL A BETTER WEAPON.       

12:54.106 --> 12:55.840
YOU CAN CARRY IT ALL DAY.       

12:55.908 --> 12:58.476
  THAT'S A VERY HEAVY WEAPON    
        TO LUG AROUND.          

12:58.544 --> 13:00.445
          - THE HENRY           
      IS A HEAVIER RIFLE.       

13:00.513 --> 13:02.714
BUT US LAKOTA WARRIORS--        
      WE HUNTED BUFFALO.        

13:02.782 --> 13:04.382
         WE DIDN'T SIT          
    IN SOME HACIENDA            

13:04.450 --> 13:06.785
  AND HAD SOMEONE FEEDING US    
    FOOD EVERY DAY...           

13:06.852 --> 13:08.720
          - [laughs]            
 - SO WE CAN HANDLE THIS GUN.   

13:08.788 --> 13:09.821
  - YOU'RE MISSING SOMETHING.   

13:09.889 --> 13:12.090
          <i>CON PERMISO.</i>          

13:12.158 --> 13:14.726
    LOOK AT THE SIZE            
    OF THESE WEAPONS.           

13:14.794 --> 13:17.896
THIS WEAPON IS MUCH MORE        
  MANEUVERABLE ON HORSEBACK.    

13:17.963 --> 13:19.164
         - COMING UP,           

13:19.231 --> 13:21.266
     THE GUNSLINGERS DUEL       
    FROM THE SADDLE,            

13:21.333 --> 13:23.468
        MACK DISCOVERS          
    THE DARING BATTLE PLANS     

13:23.536 --> 13:25.036
    THAT CHANGED THE COURSE     
          OF HISTORY,           

13:25.104 --> 13:28.973
AND WILD WEST FREEDOM FIGHTERS  
BLAST ACROSS THE DECADES        

13:29.041 --> 13:31.810
      IN AN EPIC FACE-OFF       
TO DETERMINE WHO IS DEADLIEST.  

13:50.262 --> 13:52.297
    - PANCHO VILLA...           

13:52.364 --> 13:54.065
        CRAZY HORSE...          

13:54.133 --> 13:56.601
    TWO OF HISTORY'S            
 MOST FEARED FREEDOM FIGHTERS   

13:56.669 --> 13:58.303
    TERRORIZED THE OLD WEST     

13:58.370 --> 14:01.873
     AND REWROTE THE BOOK       
     ON GUERRILLA WARFARE.      

14:01.941 --> 14:03.441
         - CRAZY HORSE          
     MAY HAVE NOT INVENTED      

14:03.509 --> 14:05.243
    THE GUERRILLA WAR           
    FIGHTER TACTICS,            

14:05.311 --> 14:08.379
BUT HE WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR  
TO ITS DEVELOPMENT TODAY.       

14:08.447 --> 14:10.448
      - USING THE ELEMENT       
          OF SURPRISE           

14:10.516 --> 14:14.185
    TO HIT FAST, HIT HARD,      
         AND DISAPPEAR          

14:14.253 --> 14:16.554
      PROVED SO EFFECTIVE       
    THAT IT'S BEEN ADOPTED      

14:16.622 --> 14:18.323
        BY NEARLY               
EVERY MODERN-DAY REBEL...       

14:18.390 --> 14:19.524
        [remote beeps]          

14:19.592 --> 14:21.726
  FROM THE JUNGLES OF VIETNAM   

14:21.794 --> 14:24.329
    TO THE MOUNTAINS            
        OF AFGHANISTAN.         

14:24.396 --> 14:27.265
         BOTH WARRIORS          
     WERE MASTER HORSEMEN.      

14:27.333 --> 14:29.567
      THE TEAMS WILL TEST       
         THE ACCURACY           

14:29.635 --> 14:31.369
        OF THEIR RIFLES         
        FROM HORSEBACK.         

14:31.437 --> 14:32.570
      - OKAY, GENTLEMEN,        

14:32.638 --> 14:34.372
          EACH OF YOU           
     WILL GET FIVE ROUNDS.      

14:34.440 --> 14:36.207
         YOU WILL RIDE          
    DOWN THIS COURSE,           

14:36.275 --> 14:38.076
 SHOOTING THESE FIVE TARGETS.   

14:38.143 --> 14:40.511
 MOSES, YOU'LL BE GOING FIRST.  

14:40.579 --> 14:43.381
SO WE'VE GOT OUR FERNANDO       
     TARGETS SET UP HERE--      

14:43.449 --> 14:46.050
     ABOUT THE RIGHT SIZE.      

14:46.118 --> 14:47.452
          [chuckles]            
             OKAY.              

14:47.519 --> 14:49.354
    - FIRST TO BE TESTED--      

14:49.421 --> 14:52.457
  THE LONGER, HEAVIER HENRY.    

14:55.628 --> 14:56.694
            - NICE.             

14:56.762 --> 14:58.863
      HE GOT IT, I THINK.       

14:58.931 --> 15:00.198
        - THERE YOU GO.         
            - WOW.              

15:00.266 --> 15:02.667
        - SO FAST, BRO.         

15:02.735 --> 15:05.603
      - NICE AND SMOOTH.        
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

15:05.671 --> 15:07.772
  - MOSES SCORES THREE HITS--   

15:07.840 --> 15:09.207
      A BROKEN CLAVICLE,        

15:09.275 --> 15:10.642
      A PERFORATED LIVER,       

15:10.709 --> 15:12.577
    AND AN ARM WOUND.           

15:12.645 --> 15:14.913
- MOSES, THE THING I SAW        
     WHEN I WATCHED YOU--       

15:14.980 --> 15:18.082
YOU ACTUALLY JUST TRUSTED       
THE HORSE TO DO THE HORSE'S JOB.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.517
    YOU DIDN'T FIDDLE           
        WITH THE REINS.         

15:19.585 --> 15:21.319
  YOU JUST STARTED COMMITTING   
        TO THE TARGET.          

15:21.387 --> 15:22.954
     - WELL, THAT WAS ONE       
     OF THE BIGGEST THINGS      

15:23.022 --> 15:24.255
FOR US AS LAKOTA PEOPLE.        

15:24.323 --> 15:27.425
        THERE'S A TRUST         
BETWEEN THE RIDER AND THE HORSE.

15:27.493 --> 15:28.927
        YOU KNOW,               
    THERE'S A BROTHERHOOD.      

15:28.994 --> 15:30.194
        - THAT'S GREAT.         

15:30.262 --> 15:31.930
     ALL RIGHT, FERNANDO,       
      WHAT DO YOU THINK?        

15:31.997 --> 15:34.165
- WELL, THREE OUT OF FIVE       
          IS NOT BAD.           

15:34.233 --> 15:36.701
 BUT WITH A GUN THAT WAS MADE   
  FOR SHOOTING OFF HORSEBACK,   

15:36.769 --> 15:39.938
     I HOPE TO DO BETTER.       

15:40.005 --> 15:42.807
      - WILL THE SHORTER,       
      LIGHTER WINCHESTER        

15:42.875 --> 15:44.776
      OUTSHOOT THE HENRY?       

15:44.843 --> 15:47.745
     - WHOA, HE'S MOVING.       

15:47.813 --> 15:50.114
     NICE. THAT WAS A HIT.      
        THAT WAS A HIT.         

15:53.152 --> 15:56.387
- FERNANDO ALSO REGISTERS       
         THREE HITS--           

15:56.455 --> 15:57.855
    A COLLAPSED LUNG,           

15:57.923 --> 15:59.590
     GRAZING TRICEP WOUND,      

15:59.658 --> 16:01.092
    AND A FRACTURED ELBOW.      

16:01.160 --> 16:03.161
          - WE'VE GOT           
    VERY SIMILAR WEAPONS--      

16:03.228 --> 16:05.163
    SOME ADVANTAGES,            
      SOME DISADVANTAGES.       

16:05.230 --> 16:06.764
     THIS ONE, IN MY MIND,      

16:06.832 --> 16:08.232
IS PROBABLY THE CLOSEST MATCHUP 
          WE'VE SEEN.           

16:08.300 --> 16:11.502
 - SO WHICH LONG-RANGE WEAPON   
        TAKES THE EDGE?         

16:11.570 --> 16:14.372
THE GUNS ARE SO EVENLY MATCHED, 

16:14.440 --> 16:16.808
    THE DECISION COMES DOWN     
        TO WHICH RIFLE          

16:16.875 --> 16:18.743
        PERFORMS BETTER         
    IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE.      

16:18.811 --> 16:20.011
    - WITH THE WINCHESTER,      

16:20.079 --> 16:21.245
        YOU KNOW,               
JUST WORKING THIS ACTION,       

16:21.313 --> 16:23.114
I FEEL LIKE I CAN WORK IT       
        WITH MY PINKIE.         

16:23.182 --> 16:24.615
        IN FACT, I CAN.         

16:24.683 --> 16:26.584
AND IF I GO TO THE HENRY,       

16:26.652 --> 16:27.986
     WORKING THAT ACTION,       

16:28.053 --> 16:30.655
          IT'S MUCH,            
MUCH MORE COARSE ACTION.        

16:30.723 --> 16:32.957
 I'M GIVING MY EDGE TO THE GUN  
      THAT WON THE WEST.        

16:33.025 --> 16:34.559
    THAT'S THE WINCHESTER.      

16:34.626 --> 16:36.961
- THIS WEAPON RIGHT HERE,       
          THE HENRY--           

16:37.029 --> 16:38.329
         YOUR MAGAZINE          
    IS EXPOSED RIGHT HERE.      

16:38.397 --> 16:39.497
         YOU SEE THIS?          
            - YEP.              

16:39.565 --> 16:41.265
         - WHICH MEANS          
     IF I'M IN THE FIELD,       

16:41.333 --> 16:43.735
  YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALL KINDS   
    OF BRUSH, DEBRIS, DIRT.     

16:43.802 --> 16:44.969
  ANYTHING THAT GETS IN THERE   

16:45.037 --> 16:46.437
  AND STARTS GUMMING UP THIS    

16:46.505 --> 16:48.439
          MAKES THIS            
    A DEAD MAN'S GUN.           

16:48.507 --> 16:50.408
    PERSONALLY, I GOT TO GO     
    WINCHESTER ALL THE WAY.     

16:50.476 --> 16:54.712
- FOR LONG-RANGE WEAPONS,       
      EDGE--PANCHO VILLA        

16:54.780 --> 16:56.914
      FOR THE WINCHESTER        
    REPEATING RIFLE.            

16:56.982 --> 16:59.617
 CAN PANCHO MAINTAIN HIS EDGE   

16:59.685 --> 17:02.286
    WHEN THE WARRIORS FIRE      
THEIR MID-RANGE WEAPONS--       

17:02.354 --> 17:04.255
          REVOLVERS?            

17:04.323 --> 17:07.858
         PANCHO DRAWS           
     A BISLEY MODEL COLT--      

17:07.925 --> 17:09.861
A WEAPON THAT DEALT DEATH       
          TO TYRANTS            

17:09.928 --> 17:11.396
    SIX BULLETS AT A TIME.      

17:11.463 --> 17:14.232
        - COLT BISLEY,          
        1894 VINTAGE--          

17:14.299 --> 17:15.266
        EXCELLENT GUN.          

17:15.334 --> 17:16.733
  IT WAS NOT MILITARY ISSUE,    

17:16.801 --> 17:18.736
    FOR COMPETITION,            
    FOR MARKSMANSHIP.           

17:18.804 --> 17:22.607
    AND IT BECAME ONE           
 OF PANCHO'S FAVORITE WEAPONS.  

17:22.674 --> 17:24.976
 PANCHO HAD COMPROMISED HANDS   

17:25.044 --> 17:26.611
BECAUSE OF THE ARTHRITIS.       

17:26.678 --> 17:28.913
- PANCHO, FROM MY UNDERSTANDING,
HAD RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS,       

17:28.981 --> 17:30.748
     AND THAT'S A SEVERELY      
      DISABLING DISEASE.        

17:30.816 --> 17:32.550
    SO WITH A WIDER HAMMER,     

17:32.618 --> 17:34.452
 IT'LL MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.  

17:34.520 --> 17:39.057
    - CRAZY HORSE COUNTERS      
 WITH THE 1873 COLT REVOLVER,   

17:39.124 --> 17:41.426
      A GUN LAKOTAS TOOK        
      FROM DEAD SOLDIERS        

17:41.493 --> 17:44.629
 TO CREATE MORE DEAD SOLDIERS.  

17:44.696 --> 17:46.831
            - AGH!              

17:46.899 --> 17:48.633
        - WE HAVE               
ABOUT A 30% LONGER BARREL       

17:48.700 --> 17:51.235
 THAN WHAT PANCHO VILLA USED.   

17:51.303 --> 17:54.105
      IT WAS ABLE TO GIVE       
    A LOT BETTER ACCURACY.      

17:54.173 --> 17:56.107
 AND OUT THERE ON THE PLAINS,   
    ACCURACY IS EVERYTHING.     

17:56.175 --> 17:57.608
            - WHOO!             
        [gunshot]               

17:57.676 --> 18:01.045
  - GEOFF WILL FIRST MEASURE    
  THE POTENTIAL KILLING POWER   

18:01.113 --> 18:03.014
        AND SPEED               
OF EACH REVOLVER'S BULLET       

18:03.082 --> 18:05.616
  BY FIRING THEM INTO A BLOCK   
      OF BALLISTICS GEL.        

18:05.684 --> 18:08.119
      - WE'RE GONNA HAVE        
      THIS REVOLVER FIXED       

18:08.187 --> 18:09.654
        AND LOCKED DOWN         
        TO THIS TABLE.          

18:09.721 --> 18:12.356
    THIS ROUND'S GONNA MOVE     
      THROUGH THE CRONY.        

18:12.424 --> 18:14.425
 WE'LL GET THE MUZZLE VELOCITY  
        OF THIS WEAPON.         

18:14.493 --> 18:16.761
  FERNANDO, YOU'RE UP FIRST.    

18:22.468 --> 18:24.502
      - THE TEST DELIVERS       
      SURPRISING RESULTS.       

18:24.570 --> 18:26.504
          THE BULLET            
  FROM PANCHO VILLA'S BISLEY    

18:26.572 --> 18:27.905
    PASSES THROUGH CLEANLY.     

18:27.973 --> 18:30.208
     - I CAN ACTUALLY SEE       
     THE PERMANENT CAVITY       

18:30.275 --> 18:31.843
 DRAW ALMOST A STRAIGHT LINE.   

18:31.910 --> 18:34.879
THERE IS NO REAL TUMBLING       
        GOING ON HERE.          

18:34.947 --> 18:37.648
 AND I WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED  
    THAT FROM A LEAD ROUND.     

18:37.716 --> 18:39.350
         - ALL RIGHT,           
        LET'S DO THIS.          

18:39.418 --> 18:43.554
    - HOW MUCH DAMAGE           
WILL CRAZY HORSE'S COLT INFLICT?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.490
            - NICE!             
        - THERE WE GO.          

18:45.557 --> 18:47.592
     - THE BULLET TUMBLES.      

18:47.659 --> 18:50.261
IN THE BODY, THE RESULTS        
     WOULD BE DEVASTATING.      

18:50.329 --> 18:52.296
  - TAKE A LOOK AT THE PATH,    

18:52.364 --> 18:53.731
        AND TAKE A LOOK         
      HOW IT GOES THROUGH       

18:53.799 --> 18:55.666
    PRETTY STRAIGHT.            

18:55.734 --> 18:57.835
    AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS?      
         - BOOM, BABY.          

18:57.903 --> 18:59.337
  - "BOOM, BABY" IS CORRECT.    

18:59.404 --> 19:01.706
     I LOVE THIS, BECAUSE       
WITHOUT HAVING TO KILL SOMEBODY,

19:01.773 --> 19:04.442
WE'RE SHOWING YOU EXACTLY WHAT  
WOULD HAPPEN INSIDE YOUR BODY.  

19:04.510 --> 19:06.878
     THE DIAMETER OF THAT       
    JUST REALLY WIDENS OUT.     

19:06.945 --> 19:08.980
THAT CAVITY JUST BECOMES HUGE.  

19:09.047 --> 19:11.182
     - CRAZY HORSE'S COLT       
          GOT A SPEED           

19:11.250 --> 19:14.652
          SLOWER THAN           
     PANCHO VILLA'S COLT.       

19:14.720 --> 19:16.454
    BUT WHAT MATTERS            
      IS INSIDE THE GEL.        

19:16.522 --> 19:17.788
AND WHAT I'M SEEING HERE        

19:17.856 --> 19:21.926
    IS THE TEMPORARY CAVITY     
     OF CRAZY HORSE'S COLT      

19:21.994 --> 19:23.594
     IS, IN FACT, LARGER.       

19:23.662 --> 19:25.196
  AND IT REALIZES THE DAMAGE    

19:25.264 --> 19:27.165
      INSIDE THE TARGET,        
     WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE       

19:27.232 --> 19:29.066
     TO PUT THE MAN DOWN.       

19:29.134 --> 19:30.535
      - THERE'S SOMETHING       
 ABOUT SLOWING THAT ROUND DOWN  

19:30.602 --> 19:31.536
         JUST ENOUGH.           

19:31.603 --> 19:33.037
    ONCE IT HITS THAT BODY,     

19:33.105 --> 19:34.872
 YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MORE DAMAGE  
         IN THAT BODY.          

19:34.940 --> 19:37.842
- COMING UP, GUNS BLAZE,        

19:37.910 --> 19:40.144
    AS OUR FREEDOM FIGHTERS     
      TURN HORSE THIEVES.       

19:40.212 --> 19:41.612
    - OH, I LOVE IT.            

19:41.680 --> 19:43.948
    - AND AFTER MORE            
        THAN A CENTURY,         

19:44.016 --> 19:46.017
    CRAZY HORSE'S WAR CLUB      
        IS RESURRECTED          

19:46.084 --> 19:47.385
        TO KILL AGAIN.          

19:51.190 --> 19:53.291
        - IT'S A BATTLE         
          BETWEEN TWO           

19:53.358 --> 19:57.361
 OF HISTORY'S MOST INNOVATIVE   
      FREEDOM FIGHTERS...       

19:57.429 --> 20:00.364
CRAZY HORSE, WHOSE FIERCE       
    HIT-AND-RUN RAIDS           

20:00.432 --> 20:01.599
  WERE EMBOLDENED BY A VISION   

20:01.667 --> 20:04.068
         THAT BULLETS           
     COULDN'T KILL HIM...       

20:04.136 --> 20:06.103
     VERSUS PANCHO VILLA,       

20:06.171 --> 20:09.140
 THE MEXICAN REBEL WHO RAIDED   
    A U.S. WEAPONS ARSENAL      

20:09.208 --> 20:11.075
AND KILLED 17 AMERICANS,        

20:11.143 --> 20:14.679
LAUNCHING ONE OF THE COUNTRY'S  
    BIGGEST MANHUNTS.           

20:16.281 --> 20:18.249
    IN THE BALLISTICS TEST,     

20:18.317 --> 20:22.119
    CRAZY HORSE'S 1873 COLT     
      CAUSED MORE DAMAGE.       

20:22.187 --> 20:24.088
         - BOOM, BABY.          

20:24.156 --> 20:27.491
  - BUT HOW WILL IT MATCH UP    
 AGAINST PANCHO'S COLT BISLEY   

20:27.559 --> 20:30.361
    WHEN THE WARRIORS TURN      
      TO HORSE THIEVERY?        

20:30.429 --> 20:32.697
  - GENTLEMEN, THESE WARRIORS   
 WERE BOTH GUERRILLA FIGHTERS.  

20:32.764 --> 20:34.365
      THEY HAD TO OBTAIN        
 THEIR RESOURCES ON THE RUN--   

20:34.433 --> 20:35.967
  NO GOVERNMENT BACKING HERE.   

20:36.034 --> 20:38.202
  SO HOW WOULD THEY RESUPPLY    
         WITH HORSES?           

20:38.270 --> 20:39.770
    - THE LAKOTA MOTTO IS,      

20:39.838 --> 20:41.973
  "TAKE THE HORSES FROM THOSE   
WHO CANNOT PROTECT THEM,        

20:42.040 --> 20:43.374
         BECAUSE THEY           
     DIDN'T DESERVE THEM,"      

20:43.442 --> 20:46.143
      WHICH PRIMARILY WAS       
    THE U.S. CAVALRY.           

20:46.211 --> 20:47.812
  - WELL, THE WAY <i>EL GENERAL</i>    
         WOULD DO IT,           

20:47.879 --> 20:50.147
         HE WOULD RIDE          
  UP TO THESE RICH HACIENDAS    

20:50.215 --> 20:51.482
         AND BASICALLY          
      JUST TAKE IT OVER.        

20:51.550 --> 20:53.517
      THESE HACIENDAS HAD       
    THE BEST HORSES.            

20:53.585 --> 20:55.886
BUT HE WOULD DISTRIBUTE ALL THE 
HORSES TO HIS MEN IN THE ARMY.  

20:55.954 --> 20:57.355
    WHATEVER WAS LEFT OVER,     

20:57.422 --> 20:59.290
 HE WOULD GIVE TO THE PEOPLE,   
        TO THE <i>PEONES.</i>          

20:59.358 --> 21:01.325
- GREAT. WELL, WE'VE GOT        
    A PERFECT TEST SET UP.      

21:01.393 --> 21:03.694
          BEHIND ME,            
YOU'LL SEE FIVE TARGETS.        

21:03.762 --> 21:05.329
      YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE        
        THOSE GUYS OUT          

21:05.397 --> 21:06.831
     WITH YOUR SIX ROUNDS.      

21:06.898 --> 21:08.332
          THE PRIZE?            
          THE HORSE.            

21:08.400 --> 21:09.433
         DON'T HIT IT.          

21:09.501 --> 21:10.801
      SPEED IS A FACTOR.        

21:10.869 --> 21:12.903
          YOU WILL BE           
ON THE CLOCK, GENTLEMEN.        

21:12.971 --> 21:14.672
SANTIAGO, ARE YOU READY?        

21:14.740 --> 21:15.940
        - <i>LISTO!</i>                

21:16.008 --> 21:19.343
         - <i>VIVA VILLA!</i>          

21:19.411 --> 21:21.045
            - YEAH!             

21:24.416 --> 21:26.484
            - NICE.             
        - THERE YOU GO.         

21:26.551 --> 21:29.453
    - OH, NICE SHOT.            

21:32.157 --> 21:34.091
            - YEAH!             
         - WELL DONE.           

21:34.159 --> 21:36.460
 - SANTIAGO SPARED THE HORSE.   

21:36.528 --> 21:39.797
        IN 17 SECONDS,          
    HE SCORED 5 HITS.           

21:39.865 --> 21:41.899
BUT HOW MANY WERE LETHAL?       

21:41.967 --> 21:44.702
        - THIS IS               
  A VERY NICELY PLACED SHOT.    

21:44.770 --> 21:46.871
  YOU'RE GETTING THAT AORTA,    
WHICH IS AN INSTANT KILL.       

21:46.938 --> 21:48.005
  THIS GUY'S GONNA BLEED OUT    

21:48.073 --> 21:49.740
      IN ABOUT 20 SECONDS       
         TO A MINUTE.           

21:49.808 --> 21:51.375
      - KILL NUMBER ONE.        
            - YES.              

21:51.443 --> 21:55.212
    - THIS GUY YOU ACTUALLY     
    DELIVERED TWO SHOTS TO.     

21:55.280 --> 21:56.614
BUT ALL YOU REALLY NEEDED       
      WAS THE FIRST ONE.        

21:56.682 --> 21:59.183
IT WENT RIGHT THROUGH THE BOTTOM
      POLE OF THAT HEART,       

21:59.251 --> 22:00.651
  PROBABLY, AGAIN, IN, LIKE,    
 15, 20 SECONDS UNCONSCIOUS--   

22:00.719 --> 22:01.719
             DEAD.              

22:01.787 --> 22:03.321
      - KILL NUMBER TWO.        
            - WHOO.             

22:03.388 --> 22:06.457
        - SANTIAGO ADDS         
     ANOTHER MORTAL WOUND,      

22:06.525 --> 22:10.294
 A GRAZE, AND A COMPLETE MISS   
         TO HIS TALLY.          

22:10.362 --> 22:11.996
 - I THINK WHEN YOU STILL HAVE  
      GUYS THAT ARE ABLE        

22:12.064 --> 22:13.097
        TO RETURN FIRE,         

22:13.165 --> 22:14.432
 YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE   

22:14.499 --> 22:17.101
        TO ACTUALLY GET         
    A BETTER RESULT.            

22:17.169 --> 22:18.769
     IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE      
    IF YOU'D HAVE BEEN ABLE     

22:18.837 --> 22:20.438
         TO CLEAN OUT           
     THE REST OF THE GUYS       

22:20.505 --> 22:21.906
      AND KNOWN THAT YOU        
      WERE GONNA BE ABLE        

22:21.973 --> 22:22.973
 TO WALK OUT WITH THAT HORSE.   

22:23.041 --> 22:25.810
    - NEXT, MOSES TAKES AIM     

22:25.877 --> 22:30.448
      WITH CRAZY HORSE'S        
LONG-BARRELED 1873 COLT.        

22:30.515 --> 22:33.084
    - [shouting in Lakota]      

22:33.151 --> 22:34.552
             - OH.              

22:34.619 --> 22:38.055
        - THERE YOU GO.         

22:38.123 --> 22:42.126
         - NICE, YES.           
    - THAT'S THE ONE.           

22:42.194 --> 22:45.396
            - NICE.             

22:47.599 --> 22:48.899
         - WHOO, YEAH!          

22:48.967 --> 22:51.569
      - YEAH, NICE WORK.        

22:51.636 --> 22:54.839
    - MOSES TOOK 21 SECONDS     
     AND MISSED THE HORSE.      

22:54.906 --> 22:56.340
            - BOOM.             

22:56.408 --> 22:59.043
- THIS IS GOING STRAIGHT BEHIND 
  THE CHEEKBONE, THE ZYGOMA.    

22:59.111 --> 23:01.278
      SO YOU'RE GONNA HIT       
THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE SKULL.

23:01.346 --> 23:02.980
            PHOO--              
         INSTANT KILL.          

23:03.048 --> 23:04.448
  - CHECK OUT THE EXIT WOUND.   

23:04.516 --> 23:06.183
     - AND THE EXIT WOUND       
         IS BEAUTIFUL.          

23:06.251 --> 23:08.185
      TARGET NUMBER TWO,        

23:08.253 --> 23:09.720
     YOU GOT YOUR CAROTID,      
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL JUGULAR.  

23:09.788 --> 23:12.123
        YOU HIT THESE,          
    YOU'RE GONNA BLEED OUT.     

23:12.190 --> 23:13.557
    IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE      
          TO CONTROL.           

23:13.625 --> 23:15.593
 THIS IS ANOTHER INSTANT KILL.  

23:15.660 --> 23:18.929
- MOSES' NEXT TWO TARGETS       

23:18.997 --> 23:21.565
 REVEAL TWO NONLETHAL WOUNDS,   

23:21.633 --> 23:23.134
     SAVING HIS BEST SHOT       
        FOR LAST.               

23:23.201 --> 23:24.502
    - OH, I LOVE IT.            

23:24.569 --> 23:26.203
      THAT'S GONNA SQUIRT       
        LIKE A SPIGOT.          

23:26.271 --> 23:28.005
    IT'S FLYING IN THE AIR.     

23:28.073 --> 23:29.340
     BUT LOOK AT THE BACK.      

23:29.408 --> 23:31.876
        BOO-YAH,                
RIGHT THROUGH THE SPINE.        

23:31.943 --> 23:33.177
    YOU CUT THROUGH THERE,      

23:33.245 --> 23:34.779
  YOU'RE GONNA STOP BREATHING   
          INSTANTLY.            

23:34.846 --> 23:35.946
    YOU'RE GONNA DIE.           

23:36.014 --> 23:37.348
        TELL ME, GUYS,          
      ABOUT PANCHO VILLA        

23:37.416 --> 23:38.783
 AND WHAT HE HAD ACTUALLY DONE  

23:38.850 --> 23:40.918
 WITH REGARDS TO MEDICAL CARE   
    FOR HIS MILITARY.           

23:40.986 --> 23:44.088
     - HE TRIED TO PREPARE      
FOR EVERY WOUNDED PERSON        

23:44.156 --> 23:46.424
      THAT WAS OUT THERE        
    WITH MEDICAL SUPPLIES.      

23:46.491 --> 23:49.293
    ON SOME OF HIS TRAINS,      
THEY HAD AT LEAST ONE CAR       

23:49.361 --> 23:51.695
        THAT WAS SET UP         
      AS A HOSPITAL CAR.        

23:51.763 --> 23:53.330
AND MORE PEOPLE SURVIVED        
    BECAUSE OF THAT.            

23:53.398 --> 23:54.432
      - WITHOUT A DOUBT.        

23:54.499 --> 23:55.766
 IT'S GOT TO BE AN "X" FACTOR,  

23:55.834 --> 23:57.468
  AND IT'S GOT TO BE FACTORED   
         INTO THE SIM.          

23:57.536 --> 23:59.904
    - PANCHO VILLA'S            
        BISLEY REVOLVER         

23:59.971 --> 24:04.141
          WAS FASTER            
 THAN CRAZY HORSE'S 1873 COLT.  

24:04.209 --> 24:07.244
         BUT THE 1873           
      WAS MORE ACCURATE.        

24:07.312 --> 24:08.712
    SO WHICH GETS THE EDGE?     

24:08.780 --> 24:10.314
            - WHOO!             

24:10.382 --> 24:13.417
- I THINK THE ADVANTAGES,       
 FRANKLY, GO WITH THE BISLEY.   

24:13.485 --> 24:14.685
    THE THING THAT'S REALLY     
    INTERESTING TO ME           

24:14.753 --> 24:16.320
      IS THAT THE .44-40        

24:16.388 --> 24:17.822
    IS THE SAME ROUND           
    THAT GOES IN HIS PISTOL     

24:17.889 --> 24:19.623
    AND GOES IN HIS RIFLE.      

24:19.691 --> 24:21.692
IF I'M GONNA HAVE TO DRAW       
         THIS WEAPON,           

24:21.760 --> 24:23.027
    IT'S A SHORTER BARREL.      

24:23.094 --> 24:24.428
    I'M GONNA BE ABLE           
     TO GET THIS THING UP       

24:24.496 --> 24:26.030
    AND ONTO TARGET SOONER.     

24:26.097 --> 24:27.898
I THINK THAT WIDER HAMMER       
         IS GONNA MAKE          

24:27.966 --> 24:29.233
  A BIGGER DIFFERENCE FOR ME.   

24:29.301 --> 24:30.601
         - SO FOR ME,           
      I'M GIVING MY EDGE        

24:30.669 --> 24:32.169
         TO THE 1873.           

24:32.237 --> 24:35.706
  IT'S GIVING ME MORE DAMAGE    
    IN THE BALLISTICS GEL.      

24:35.774 --> 24:37.274
        AS FAR AS WHEN          
     THE OPERATOR USED IT,      

24:37.342 --> 24:39.210
  ALL FIVE TARGETS WERE HIT.    

24:39.277 --> 24:40.744
  THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES FOR ME.   

24:40.812 --> 24:42.613
        - FOR ME,               
I HAVE TO AGREE WITH YOU.       

24:42.681 --> 24:44.281
          I GOT TO GO           
 WITH WHAT CAUSED MORE MAYHEM,  

24:44.349 --> 24:45.516
         MORE TRAUMA.           

24:45.584 --> 24:46.750
        AND IN THE END,         

24:46.818 --> 24:48.385
         IT COMES DOWN          
    TO THE COLT 1873.           

24:48.453 --> 24:51.522
- FOR ME, THE EDGE STILL STAYS  
    WITH THE BISLEY.            

24:51.590 --> 24:53.657
  - BY A VOTE OF TWO TO ONE,    

24:53.725 --> 24:57.862
    EDGE--CRAZY HORSE           
      FOR THE 1873 COLT.        

24:57.929 --> 25:00.831
      THE KEY "X" FACTOR        
      THAT WILL BE ADDED        

25:00.899 --> 25:03.701
 TO THE DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE   
    IS BATTLEFIELD TACTICS.     

25:03.768 --> 25:05.302
    MACK WILL ANALYZE           

25:05.370 --> 25:08.038
     ONE OF PANCHO VILLA'S      
 MOST EFFECTIVE BATTLE PLANS.   

25:08.106 --> 25:11.008
- WHAT IS PANCHO VILLA'S        
 FAVORITE STRATEGY AND TACTIC?  

25:11.076 --> 25:12.977
        - IT IS CALLED          
      <i>EL GOLPE TERRIFICO,</i>       

25:13.044 --> 25:15.279
          WHICH MEANS           
     "THE TERRIFIC BLOW,"       

25:15.347 --> 25:17.314
OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT,        
      THE FEROCIOUS BLOW.       

25:17.382 --> 25:19.750
  - WHAT IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE   
            OF IT?              

25:19.818 --> 25:21.552
  - SECOND BATTLE OF TORREON.   

25:21.620 --> 25:23.387
         - ALL RIGHT,           
WE'RE GONNA USE THE TOUCHTABLE  

25:23.455 --> 25:24.455
    AND GO THERE NOW.           

25:24.523 --> 25:25.856
    - IT IS MARCH 20, 1914.     

25:25.924 --> 25:28.959
    IT IS THE MIDDLE            
  OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION.    

25:29.027 --> 25:33.030
 - PANCHO'S VILLISTAS TAKE ON   
    10,000 ENEMY FEDERALES      

25:33.098 --> 25:35.466
     AT THE RAILROAD TOWN       
         AT TORREON--           

25:35.534 --> 25:38.168
        THE KEY GATEWAY         
 TO MEXICO'S NORTHERN STATES.   

25:38.236 --> 25:39.403
- HE SENDS HIS INFANTRY,        

25:39.471 --> 25:41.171
     AND IT'S PRETTY MUCH       
          A DISASTER.           

25:41.239 --> 25:43.207
      HE CANNOT ADVANCE.        
THEY ARE OUTMANNED HERE.        

25:43.275 --> 25:45.643
 - FEDERALES START ATTACKING,   

25:45.710 --> 25:47.444
    AND THEY START DROPPING     
    ARTILLERY ON IT.            

25:47.512 --> 25:48.979
      PEOPLE ARE STARTING       
TO GET WIPED OUT, RIGHT?        

25:49.047 --> 25:50.447
          - EXACTLY.            
 HE LEARNS FROM HIS MISTAKES.   

25:50.515 --> 25:52.149
- HE ADAPTS VERY QUICKLY.       
          - EXACTLY.            

25:52.217 --> 25:54.118
      - THEY HAVE EXPOSED       
    THEIR POSITIONS.            

25:54.185 --> 25:55.352
        HE KNOWS WHERE          
THE ARTILLERY PIECES ARE.       

25:55.420 --> 25:56.587
 HE WANTS TO SURROUND THIS...   
          - EXACTLY.            

25:56.655 --> 25:58.088
      - TO THE VERY BEST        
        OF HIS ABILITY.         

25:58.156 --> 26:00.257
- HE KNOWS HE CAN'T TAKE        
 THIS POSITION DURING THE DAY,  

26:00.325 --> 26:02.326
     SO HE COMES AT NIGHT.      
            - BOOM.             

26:02.394 --> 26:04.361
  HE'S GOT THIS ONE POSITION    
  COMPLETELY SURROUNDED NOW.    

26:04.429 --> 26:05.863
- HE'S GOT IT SURROUNDED.       

26:05.931 --> 26:09.066
THIS IS WHERE HE LAUNCHES       
      <i>EL GOLPE TERRIFICO.</i>       

26:09.134 --> 26:11.135
         - HE ATTACKS           
AND USES THE COVER OF DARKNESS  

26:11.202 --> 26:13.837
         AGAINST THEM,          
  CONSTANTLY HARASSING THEM.    

26:13.905 --> 26:15.406
THESE GUYS AREN'T GETTING       
          ANY SLEEP.            

26:15.473 --> 26:17.074
    - THE FEDERALES--           
  THEY'RE GETTING SCARED NOW.   

26:17.142 --> 26:19.243
- PANCHO CRUSHES THIS POSITION, 

26:19.311 --> 26:22.880
    AND THIS TERRIFIC BLOW      
 BECOMES THIS LEGENDARY THREAT  

26:22.948 --> 26:25.716
  ANYTIME PANCHO VILLA COMES    
         INTO AN AREA.          

26:25.784 --> 26:27.418
- WHEN A MAN LIKE PANCHO VILLA  
         COMES ALONG,           

26:27.485 --> 26:29.787
  THE PEOPLE ARE GONNA RALLY    
        AND FOLLOW HIM,         

26:29.854 --> 26:31.922
    BECAUSE HE FIGHTS           
    FOR WHAT'S RIGHT.           

26:31.990 --> 26:33.991
     - LIKE NO ONE BEFORE,      

26:34.059 --> 26:36.126
    VILLA RALLIED PEASANTS      
    TO FIGHT FOR THE DEATH      

26:36.194 --> 26:39.263
  FOR HIM AND HIS REVOLUTION.   

26:39.331 --> 26:41.865
      NEXT, CRAZY HORSE'S       
    CREATIVE TACTICS            

26:41.933 --> 26:44.068
     BLOODY THE BLUECOATS.      

26:44.135 --> 26:46.437
    AND PANCHO VILLA TAKES      
         HIS HACKS...           

26:46.504 --> 26:47.905
        - HACK HIM UP!          

26:47.973 --> 26:53.010
    - WITH AN EVERYDAY TOOL     
     TURNED LETHAL WEAPON.      

26:53.078 --> 26:56.780
     - CRAZY HORSE, LEADER      
OF THE LAKOTA RESISTANCE,       

26:56.848 --> 26:59.316
      WHO FOUGHT SETTLERS       
         AND SOLDIERS           

26:59.384 --> 27:02.486
      WHO BROKE TREATIESS       
     AND STOLE HIS LAND...      

27:02.554 --> 27:03.988
         PANCHO VILLA,          

27:04.055 --> 27:06.557
            WARLORD             
  OF THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION,    

27:06.625 --> 27:08.225
 WHO INVADED THE UNITED STATES  

27:08.293 --> 27:11.362
    TO STEAL WEAPONS            
    FOR HIS GUERRILLA ARMY.     

27:11.429 --> 27:12.630
          IN A BATTLE           

27:12.697 --> 27:15.232
    BETWEEN AMERICA'S           
    TWO MOST WANTED REBELS,     

27:15.300 --> 27:17.401
        WHO WOULD WIN?          

27:17.469 --> 27:19.403
        EACH WARRIOR'S          
      BATTLEFIELD TACTICS       

27:19.471 --> 27:21.171
WILL PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE        

27:21.239 --> 27:23.440
      IN OUR FIVE-ON-FIVE       
    SIMULATED BATTLE.           

27:23.508 --> 27:25.643
         - CRAZY HORSE          
      HAD TO GET CREATIVE       

27:25.710 --> 27:26.910
    WITH HIS TACTICS,           

27:26.978 --> 27:29.279
    BECAUSE HE DIDN'T HAVE      
         THE RESOURCES          

27:29.347 --> 27:33.317
        AT HIS DISPOSAL         
 TO TAKE ON THE U.S. CAVALRY.   

27:33.385 --> 27:36.186
    - HE IS A MASTER            
 AT THE HIT-AND-RUN STRATEGY.   

27:36.254 --> 27:38.722
        PERFECT EXAMPLE         
IS THE BATTLE OF ROSEBUD CREEK. 

27:38.790 --> 27:40.524
        JUNE 17, 1876.          

27:40.592 --> 27:43.427
- IN PRESENT-DAY MONTANA,       

27:43.495 --> 27:46.196
    GENERAL CROOK'S CAVALRY     
    ENCOUNTERS A BAND           

27:46.264 --> 27:48.899
      OF LAKOTA WARRIORS        
      LED BY CRAZY HORSE.       

27:48.967 --> 27:50.367
 - WHAT DOES GENERAL CROOK DO?  

27:50.435 --> 27:53.771
    - HE PUT HIS MEN ONLINE     
    UP ROSEBUD CREEK.           

27:53.838 --> 27:55.673
 - SO HE WANTS TO SEND HIS MEN  
         INTO POSITION          

27:55.740 --> 27:58.242
    WHERE THEY CAN LAY DOWN     
        A BASE OF FIRE.         

27:58.309 --> 28:00.778
    BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT     
 CRAZY HORSE WANTS, ISN'T IT?   

28:00.845 --> 28:02.980
- YES, COMMUNICATION'S OBVIOUSLY
 BREAKING DOWN AT THIS POINT,   

28:03.048 --> 28:05.049
'CAUSE CRAZY HORSE IS COMING IN 
WITH HIT-AND-RUN PARTIES.       

28:05.116 --> 28:06.517
- HE WANTS TO DRAW FIRE.        

28:06.584 --> 28:08.919
  HE WANTS THEM TO EMPTY OUT    
THEIR MAGAZINES, CORRECT?       

28:08.987 --> 28:10.320
          - CORRECT.            

28:10.388 --> 28:12.356
  AND AS SOON AS THEY'RE DONE   
    SHOOTING AND RELOADING,     

28:12.424 --> 28:13.924
      THE FULL-ON CHARGE        
        COMES THROUGH.          

28:13.992 --> 28:15.859
- CRAZY HORSE HEADS BACK,       
        AND HE ATTACKS          

28:15.927 --> 28:17.194
  FROM A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.   

28:17.262 --> 28:20.230
     HE WANTS TO HIT, RUN,      
    HIT, RUN, ALL DAY LONG.     

28:20.298 --> 28:22.700
GUYS ARE BASICALLY TRYING       
    TO SHOOT AT THE LAKOTA      

28:22.767 --> 28:24.134
    AS THEY'RE COMING           
      THROUGH THE LINES.        

28:24.202 --> 28:25.669
     AND THEY'RE SHOOTING       
        AT EACH OTHER.          

28:25.737 --> 28:27.971
- WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS THEIR 
 LINES ARE BEGINNING TO FAIL.   

28:28.039 --> 28:30.240
 - THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD  
 FOR GENERAL CROOK RIGHT NOW.   

28:30.308 --> 28:31.675
     HE CAN'T COMMUNICATE.      

28:31.743 --> 28:33.043
    HE CAN'T GET MORE AMMO.     
             - NO.              

28:33.111 --> 28:35.446
- AT THIS POINT, THE UPPER HAND 
    HE THOUGHT HE HAD           

28:35.513 --> 28:37.448
      WITH VOLUME OF FIRE       
         AND MORE MEN           

28:37.515 --> 28:39.416
     IS ACTUALLY STARTING       
     TO PLAY AGAINST HIM.       

28:39.484 --> 28:41.385
    - THERE'S NO WAY            
    HE CAN REINFORCE CUSTER     

28:41.453 --> 28:43.120
      AT LITTLE BIGHORN--       
      WHAT'S HE GONNA DO?       

28:43.188 --> 28:45.255
          HE'S GONNA            
START PULLING OUT, RIGHT?       

28:45.323 --> 28:47.291
          - EXACTLY.            
THIS BATTLE ACTUALLY LED        

28:47.358 --> 28:50.227
      TO CUSTER'S DEFEAT        
AT LITTLE BIGHORN A WEEK LATER. 

28:50.295 --> 28:53.630
    - SO HIT-AND-RUN WORKS.     
         - PRECISELY.           

28:53.698 --> 28:56.200
     - SO WHICH WARRIOR'S       
      BATTLEFIELD TACTICS       

28:56.267 --> 28:59.670
    WILL GIVE HIM THE EDGE      
     IN THE COMBAT ENGINE?      

28:59.738 --> 29:01.305
        - PANCHO VILLA          
     CLEARLY DEMONSTRATES       

29:01.372 --> 29:03.841
 HE IS A FORCE TO BE RECKONED   
    WITH ON A BATTLEFIELD.      

29:03.908 --> 29:07.377
     BUT CRAZY HORSE'S USE      
          OF TACTICS            

29:07.445 --> 29:09.213
      THAT ARE CREATIVE,        
        ADAPTIVE,               

29:09.280 --> 29:10.814
      HIS USE OF TERRAIN        

29:10.882 --> 29:14.184
AGAINST A TECHNOLOGICALLY       
        SUPERIOR FORCE,         

29:14.252 --> 29:18.122
REALLY SHOWS WHAT HE'S CAPABLE  
        OF AS A LEADER.         

29:18.189 --> 29:21.725
     - FOR THE "X" FACTOR       
     BATTLEFIELD TACTICS,       

29:21.793 --> 29:23.494
      EDGE--CRAZY HORSE.        

29:23.561 --> 29:26.330
    WHEN IT WAS TIME            
TO MOVE IN FOR THE KILL,        

29:26.397 --> 29:28.732
        THESE WARRIORS          
     TURNED EVERYDAY TOOLS      

29:28.800 --> 29:30.901
  INTO CLOSE-COMBAT SLAYERS.    

29:30.969 --> 29:34.304
    CRAZY HORSE LEADS           
    WITH THE <i>INYANKAPEMNI--</i>     

29:34.372 --> 29:37.441
    A HUNTING CLUB PERFECT      
  FOR BLUDGEONING BLUECOATS.    

29:37.509 --> 29:40.577
 TO ENSURE TEST AUTHENTICITY,   

29:40.645 --> 29:42.880
     OUR WEAPONS DESIGNER,      
          DAVE BAKER,           

29:42.947 --> 29:46.283
        HAS RE-CREATED          
THE CENTURIES-OLD BATTLE CLUB,  

29:46.351 --> 29:49.853
    WITH PERSONAL GUIDANCE      
    FROM LAKOTA TRIBESMEN.      

29:49.921 --> 29:51.655
         - WHAT IT IS,          
    IS A BOXITE HEAD,           

29:51.723 --> 29:54.892
  SHAPED INTO A TWO-POINTED,    
    ALMOST FOOTBALL SHAPE,      

29:54.959 --> 29:55.859
          AND A HOLE.           

29:55.927 --> 29:58.695
    NOW, INTO THAT WAS FIT      

29:58.763 --> 30:01.832
         A CHOKECHERRY          
     OR NATIVE PLUM SHAFT,      

30:01.900 --> 30:03.834
AND THEN THE ENTIRE THING       
     IS WRAPPED IN RAWHIDE      

30:03.902 --> 30:05.235
         AND SEWN UP,           

30:05.303 --> 30:08.505
 CREATING AN INCREDIBLY STRONG  
      AND FLEXIBLE CLUB.        

30:08.573 --> 30:09.907
      WHEN YOU SWING IT,        

30:09.974 --> 30:12.109
        IT ALMOST TAKES         
      A WHIPPING EFFECT,        

30:12.177 --> 30:14.311
WHICH WOULD ADD A LOT OF FORCE  
         TO THAT BLOW.          

30:14.379 --> 30:16.480
            - UGH!              

30:16.548 --> 30:18.148
  - OKAY, BLU, ON THIS TEST,    

30:18.216 --> 30:21.018
  WHAT WE'VE GOT SET UP HERE    
  IS A BALLISTICS-GEL TORSO.    

30:21.085 --> 30:23.520
     BALLISTICS GEL MIMICS      
BOTH THE DENSITY AND VISCOSITY  

30:23.588 --> 30:25.088
     OF REAL HUMAN TISSUE.      

30:25.156 --> 30:27.758
  I WILL GIVE YOU 15 SECONDS    
     TO DO AS MUCH DAMAGE       

30:27.826 --> 30:29.259
     ON THIS TORSO, OKAY?       

30:29.327 --> 30:31.528
I WANT TO SEE HEAD SHOTS.       
I WANT TO SEE BODY SHOTS.       

30:31.596 --> 30:34.598
    - GEOFF ATTACHES            
     AN ORIENTATION SENSOR      

30:34.666 --> 30:37.067
TO REGISTER THE WEAPON'S        
    IMPACT VELOCITY.            

30:37.135 --> 30:39.903
     - ON THREE, TWO, ONE.      

30:39.971 --> 30:42.639
        KILL IT!                

30:42.707 --> 30:44.608
      - HARD, BLU, HARD!        

30:44.676 --> 30:45.676
        - GET IT.               
            - AGH!              

30:45.743 --> 30:47.144
        - THERE YOU GO.         
            - YEAH!             

30:47.212 --> 30:48.512
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
    - MORE! BUST IT!            

30:48.580 --> 30:50.013
    - EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT.     

30:50.081 --> 30:52.115
        - THERE YOU GO!         
    KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING!     

30:55.587 --> 30:57.654
        - THERE YOU GO!         
            - TIME.             

30:57.722 --> 30:58.822
    - OH, HO, HO, HO!           

30:58.890 --> 31:00.357
    - THERE IT GOES.            

31:00.425 --> 31:01.658
             - OH.              
            - YEAH.             

31:01.726 --> 31:04.161
- THE <i>INYANKAPEMNI</i> WHIPS        

31:04.229 --> 31:06.063
    INTO THE GEL HEAD           
        AND TORSO               

31:06.130 --> 31:08.999
    AT 104 MILES PER HOUR.      

31:09.067 --> 31:10.467
      - THIS HEAD INJURY?       
         THAT'S REAL.           

31:10.535 --> 31:11.869
          - OH, YEAH.           

31:11.936 --> 31:14.004
     YOU DON'T HAVE TO DIE      
    FROM A FRACTURED SKULL.     

31:14.072 --> 31:15.539
WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME.       

31:15.607 --> 31:16.907
        BUT IF YOU GET          
  A DEPRESSED SKULL FRACTURE,   

31:16.975 --> 31:19.476
  IT'S AN EXPONENTIAL CHANCE    
        OF THE BLEEDING         

31:19.544 --> 31:20.744
      INSIDE YOUR BRAIN'S       
ACTUALLY GONNA KILL YOU.        

31:20.812 --> 31:22.446
    IT'S GONNA CAUSE            
    THAT HERNIATION.            

31:22.513 --> 31:25.983
  SO THIS IS A KILLING WEAPON   
  WHEN YOU STRIKE THE SKULL.    

31:26.050 --> 31:27.985
        ANYWHERE ELSE,          
        IT HURTS A LOT,         

31:28.052 --> 31:29.086
      BUT IT WON'T KILL.        

31:29.153 --> 31:30.354
- WHEN YOU WERE ACTUALLY        

31:30.421 --> 31:31.955
      MEASURING YOUR PACE       
         A LITTLE BIT,          

31:32.023 --> 31:34.157
 YOU WERE ABLE TO CONTROL THAT  
         A LOT BETTER.          

31:34.225 --> 31:36.093
WHEN YOU REALLY UNLOADED,       

31:36.160 --> 31:38.962
    THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES      
    MUCH MORE UNRULY.           

31:39.030 --> 31:40.731
  YOU HAVE TO REALLY REGROUP    

31:40.798 --> 31:42.966
AND RECOLLECT THE WEAPON        
  BEFORE YOU LAUNCH IT AGAIN.   

31:43.034 --> 31:44.601
- OH, I'M STILL NOT IMPRESSED.  

31:44.669 --> 31:46.136
          IT TOOK HIM           
     QUITE A BIT OF WHACKS      

31:46.204 --> 31:47.504
     TO GET THE JOB DONE.       

31:47.572 --> 31:48.739
     WITH THE BOLO KNIFE,       

31:48.806 --> 31:49.673
         IT'S GONNA DO          
      A LOT MORE DAMAGE,        

31:49.741 --> 31:50.974
    GONNA BE MORE ACCURATE.     

31:51.042 --> 31:52.809
          AND I HAVE            
     THE LONG BLADE HERE,       

31:52.877 --> 31:54.344
 WHICH WILL GET THE JOB DONE.   

31:54.412 --> 31:56.847
    - GETTING THE JOB DONE      
    FOR GENERATIONS,            

31:56.915 --> 31:59.983
    THE MEXICAN BOLO KNIFE,     

32:00.051 --> 32:02.920
    A PEASANT'S TOOL            
     TURNED REBEL WEAPON.       

32:02.987 --> 32:04.421
- WHILE RESEARCHING THIS,       

32:04.489 --> 32:05.856
      I TALKED WITH A LOT       
    OF OUR <i>VAQUERO</i> EXPERTS      

32:05.924 --> 32:07.357
 AND OUR PANCHO VILLA EXPERTS.  

32:07.425 --> 32:09.660
  AND THEY SAID THIS WAS ONE    
OF THE MOST COMMON TOOLS        

32:09.727 --> 32:11.862
CARRIED BY THE <i>VAQUEROS,</i>        
   OR THE COWBOYS, IN MEXICO.   

32:11.930 --> 32:13.430
         THIS WAS MADE          
OUT OF ANY KIND OF STEEL        

32:13.498 --> 32:14.898
THEY COULD GET THEIR HANDS ON.  

32:14.966 --> 32:16.066
    ANY HIGH-CARBON STEEL.      

32:16.134 --> 32:18.635
 BUGGY SPRINGS, KNIFE BLADES,   

32:18.703 --> 32:20.003
         FILE BLADES.           

32:20.071 --> 32:22.372
      AND IT WAS HAMMERED       
INTO A HEAD-HEAVY DESIGN,       

32:22.440 --> 32:24.775
         WHICH GAVE IT          
  A LOT OF POWER ON THE CHOP.   

32:24.842 --> 32:26.910
  - SANTIAGO, ARE YOU READY?    

32:26.978 --> 32:28.712
        - <i>LISTO!</i>                

32:28.780 --> 32:31.148
     - ON THREE, TWO, ONE!      

32:31.215 --> 32:32.816
         HACK HIM UP!           

32:32.884 --> 32:37.020
         - <i>VIVA VILLA!</i>          

32:37.088 --> 32:40.190
         - OH, HO, HO!          

32:40.258 --> 32:42.826
          HO, HO, HO.           

32:42.894 --> 32:47.264
            - OOH.              

32:47.332 --> 32:51.768
            - TIME!             

32:51.836 --> 32:53.170
      - IT'S A FUNCTIONAL       
         DECAPITATION.          

32:53.237 --> 32:54.371
  THE HEAD'S NOT GONNA FALL.    

32:54.439 --> 32:55.672
    THE LIGAMENT INTEGRITY      
    IS VERY DIFFICULT           

32:55.740 --> 32:56.740
        TO CUT THROUGH.         

32:56.808 --> 32:57.741
    HAVING SAID THAT,           

32:57.809 --> 32:59.042
  HE WILL BE GETTING IT PAST    

32:59.110 --> 33:00.110
THE SIGNIFICANT ARTERIES,       

33:00.178 --> 33:01.578
  THE CAROTIDS, THE JUGULARS.   

33:01.646 --> 33:03.680
         BUT LET'S GET          
TO THE BODY TRAUMA HERE.        

33:03.748 --> 33:06.483
     YOU'RE GETTING A LOT       
        OF LACERATIONS          

33:06.551 --> 33:08.352
     THAT ARE GONNA GO IN       
    RIGHT TO THE RIB.           

33:08.419 --> 33:10.721
     SO A LOT OF BLEEDING,      
        A LOT OF PAIN.          

33:10.788 --> 33:13.090
     EVENTUALLY, THIS GUY       
WOULD BE IN DEEP TROUBLE        

33:13.157 --> 33:14.658
        FROM INFECTION,         
        FROM BLEEDING.          

33:14.726 --> 33:16.226
        BUT THIS ITSELF         
        IS NOT THE WAY          

33:16.294 --> 33:17.394
  YOU'RE GONNA KILL THIS GUY.   

33:17.462 --> 33:18.829
        THIS IS THE WAY         
    YOU'RE GONNA KILL HIM.      

33:18.896 --> 33:20.130
        - WHEN YOU LOOK         
     AT THE SURFACE AREA,       

33:20.198 --> 33:23.300
     THERE'S JUST SO MUCH       
     KILLING SURFACE AREA.      

33:23.368 --> 33:25.202
    ALSO, IT'S MUCH HARDER      
        TO BREAK.               

33:25.269 --> 33:26.670
      THAT'S A BIG FACTOR       
            FOR ME.             

33:26.738 --> 33:28.038
            - AGH!              

33:28.106 --> 33:30.273
        - CRAZY HORSE'S

 OR PANCHO VILLA'S BOLO KNIFE?  

33:32.577 --> 33:34.277
         - [grunting]           

33:34.345 --> 33:36.580
  - WHICH CLOSE-RANGE WEAPON    
        GETS THE EDGE?          

33:36.647 --> 33:38.782
        - <i>INYANKAPEMNI,</i>         
         YOU GOT TO HIT         

33:38.850 --> 33:41.551
"INYABRAINY" TO ACTUALLY        
        CAUSE A DEATH.          

33:41.619 --> 33:42.719
    - FROM SOMETHING            
    THAT DOESN'T BREAK DOWN     

33:42.787 --> 33:43.787
    TO SOMETHING THAT DOES      
          BREAK DOWN,           

33:43.855 --> 33:44.788
  WHAT ARE YOU GONNA CHOOSE?    

33:44.856 --> 33:45.789
    - AND IF YOU'RE TALKING     

33:45.857 --> 33:47.257
    ABOUT FACING THAT CLUB,     

33:47.325 --> 33:49.326
    IF I CAN GET PAST           
        THAT ROCK               

33:49.394 --> 33:50.961
    AND GET THAT BEHIND ME,     

33:51.029 --> 33:52.329
     CLOSE THAT DISTANCE,       

33:52.397 --> 33:53.730
    NOW I CAN DO SOMETHING.     

33:53.798 --> 33:55.732
     BUT IF YOU'RE FACING       
        THE BOLO KNIFE,         

33:55.800 --> 33:59.436
    THERE'S 14 INCHES           
    OF REAL DANGEROUS AREA      

33:59.504 --> 34:01.838
THAT I'VE GOT TO SOMEHOW CROSS. 

34:01.906 --> 34:03.940
    IT MAKES IT MUCH HARDER     
      FOR ME TO STEP IN,        

34:04.008 --> 34:05.208
    TO GET IN CLOSE.            

34:05.276 --> 34:06.910
    AND WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING     
         AT THE CLUB,           

34:06.978 --> 34:08.145
    THAT THING BROKE.           
         - DONE DEAL.           

34:08.212 --> 34:10.347
  - FOR CLOSE-RANGE WEAPONS,    

34:10.415 --> 34:12.681
EDGE: PANCHO VILLA'S BOLO KNIFE.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.952
          COMING UP,            
    THE FINAL BATTLE.           

34:16.020 --> 34:18.054
         CRAZY HORSE,           
     THE AVENGING WARRIOR       

34:18.121 --> 34:19.623
     OF THE LAKOTA NATION,      

34:19.690 --> 34:21.058
 WHOSE BLOODTHIRSTY SLAUGHTER   

34:21.125 --> 34:22.692
    OF INVADING U.S. FORCES     

34:22.760 --> 34:25.629
MADE HIM THE MOST FEARED ENEMY  
    OF THE OLD WEST,            

34:25.696 --> 34:27.164
     VERSUS PANCHO VILLA,       

34:27.231 --> 34:29.833
THE REBEL WHO TERRORIZED        
     TWO NATIONS AT ONCE,       

34:29.900 --> 34:31.501
CRUSHED MEXICAN TYRANTS,        

34:31.569 --> 34:35.972
    AND PROVOKED A MANHUNT      
  BY 10,000 AMERICAN TROOPS.    

34:36.040 --> 34:38.809
      GUERRILLA FIGHTERS        
    UNLEASH THEIR SAVAGERY      

34:38.876 --> 34:41.143
  IN A SHOWDOWN FOR THE AGES.   

34:41.212 --> 34:43.513
          WHO WILL BE           
    THE <i>DEADLIEST WARRIOR?</i>      

35:02.733 --> 35:04.101
         - [grunting]           

35:04.168 --> 35:07.804
        - PANCHO VILLA          
      VERSUS CRAZY HORSE.       

35:07.872 --> 35:11.274
    WHO IS DEADLIEST?           

35:11.342 --> 35:12.609
        - HACK HIM UP!          

35:12.677 --> 35:16.113
- OUR TEAM HAS COMPLETED        
        EXTENSIVE TESTS         

35:16.180 --> 35:18.014
    OF THE LETHAL ARSENALS      
THESE WILD WEST WARRIORS        

35:18.082 --> 35:20.350
          WILL BRING            
 TO THEIR LEGENDARY SHOWDOWN.   

35:20.418 --> 35:22.552
    FOR LONG-RANGE WEAPONS,     

35:22.620 --> 35:25.188
      THE WINCHESTER 1894       
        REPEATING RIFLE         

35:25.256 --> 35:27.557
     PROVED MORE RELIABLE       

35:27.625 --> 35:30.927
      THAN CRAZY HORSE'S        
  1860 HENRY REPEATING RIFLE.   

35:30.995 --> 35:33.964
      EDGE: PANCHO VILLA.       

35:34.031 --> 35:36.233
FOR MEDIUM-RANGE WEAPONS,       

35:36.300 --> 35:39.803
      THE MODEL 1873 COLT       
      CAUSED MORE DAMAGE        

35:39.871 --> 35:43.073
         THAN PANCHO'S          
    BISLEY MODEL REVOLVER.      

35:43.141 --> 35:46.109
      EDGE: CRAZY HORSE.        

35:46.177 --> 35:47.777
FOR CLOSE-RANGE WEAPONS,        

35:47.845 --> 35:50.113
THE BOLO KNIFE CARVED UP        

35:50.181 --> 35:53.049
  CRAZY HORSE'S <i>INYANKAPEMNI</i>    
           WAR CLUB.            

35:53.117 --> 35:56.319
      EDGE: PANCHO VILLA.       

35:56.387 --> 35:59.623
    THE WEAPONS DATA            
AND OVER 100 "X" FACTORS        

35:59.690 --> 36:02.359
         HAVE BEEN FED          
INTO THE DIGITAL COMBAT ENGINE. 

36:02.426 --> 36:04.594
- WE LOOK AT "X" FACTORS        

36:04.662 --> 36:08.565
 LIKE BATTLEFIELD EXPERIENCE,   
     LOGISTICS, TENACITY.       

36:08.633 --> 36:10.667
        WE LOOK AT ALL          
      THE HISTORICAL DATA       

36:10.735 --> 36:12.068
     ABOUT THEIR BATTLES,       
    THEIR FIGHTING STYLES,      

36:12.136 --> 36:14.070
          THE WEAPONS           
      THAT THEY'RE USING.       

36:14.138 --> 36:16.907
    WE THEN RATE THEM           
    ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 100,     

36:16.974 --> 36:18.842
        WITH 100 BEING          
     THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR.      

36:18.910 --> 36:20.810
        - FOR ME,               
    LOGISTICS IS GONNA PLAY     

36:20.878 --> 36:22.078
  A HUGE ROLE IN THIS BATTLE.   

36:22.146 --> 36:23.213
          - YOU KNOW,           
THAT'S ONE OF THE FACTORS       

36:23.281 --> 36:24.514
      THAT I REALLY LIKE.       

36:24.582 --> 36:27.784
  THAT BISLEY ACTUALLY SHOOTS   
        THE 4-40,               

36:27.852 --> 36:29.386
          AND AGAIN,            
     PANCHO VILLA'S RIFLE       

36:29.453 --> 36:30.654
     ALSO SHOOTS THE 4-40.      

36:30.721 --> 36:31.888
    SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING      

36:31.956 --> 36:33.123
     ABOUT OPERATIONALLY,       
         IN THE FIELD,          

36:33.191 --> 36:35.058
    I'M NOT HAVING TO CARRY     
      A BUNCH OF ROUNDS.        

36:35.126 --> 36:36.393
    I LITERALLY TAKE            
        THE SAME ROUND,         

36:36.460 --> 36:37.961
     PUT IT IN THE WEAPON,      
          AND USE IT.           

36:38.029 --> 36:41.531
- PANCHO VILLA REALLY WAS       
    DOMINANT IN THIS SPACE.     

36:41.599 --> 36:43.934
PANCHO VILLA'S "X" FACTOR       
    FOR THE LOGISTICS           

36:44.001 --> 36:45.535
      WE RATED AT AN 87.        

36:45.603 --> 36:47.837
         CRAZY HORSE,           
BECAUSE HE WAS FORAGING,        

36:47.905 --> 36:49.139
      WE RATED HIM A 54.        

36:49.207 --> 36:52.876
- FOR ME, A CRUCIAL "X" FACTOR  
          IS DISEASE.           

36:52.944 --> 36:55.378
     CRAZY HORSE WAS ABLE       
      TO NARROWLY ESCAPE        

36:55.446 --> 36:57.914
         THE SMALLPOX           
  AND TUBERCULOSIS EPIDEMICS.   

36:57.982 --> 36:59.316
    BUT PANCHO VILLA,           

36:59.383 --> 37:03.353
     WE DISCUSSED EARLIER       
ABOUT HIS RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. 

37:03.421 --> 37:05.422
- CRAZY HORSE WAS NOT AFFECTED  
    BY THESE THINGS.            

37:05.489 --> 37:07.390
     SO WE RATED HIM A 73.      

37:07.458 --> 37:08.425
      ON THE OTHER HAND,        
         PANCHO VILLA,          

37:08.492 --> 37:10.627
     HE DID HAVE INSOMNIA.      

37:10.695 --> 37:12.462
    HE DID HAVE ARTHRITIS.      

37:12.530 --> 37:13.797
     SO WE HAD TO RATE HIM      
          REALLY LOW,           

37:13.864 --> 37:15.498
     AND WE GAVE HIM A 44.      

37:15.566 --> 37:16.566
        - FOR ME,               
    WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT     

37:16.634 --> 37:17.601
    WITH THE WARRIORS           

37:17.668 --> 37:18.702
          IS TACTICS.           

37:18.769 --> 37:20.737
    WHO SETS UP THE MOMENT      
        THE BEST?               

37:20.805 --> 37:22.606
         WHO EXECUTES           
      AND FOLLOWS THROUGH       

37:22.673 --> 37:23.673
        IN THAT MOMENT?         

37:23.741 --> 37:24.874
     HOW DID YOU RATE 'EM?      

37:24.942 --> 37:26.509
  - BOTH OF THESE COMMANDERS    

37:26.577 --> 37:29.412
        REALLY ADAPTED          
    TO THE SITUATION,           

37:29.480 --> 37:32.182
     AND FROM TACTICALLY,       
  THEY WERE EXTREMELY SOUND.    

37:32.250 --> 37:34.284
    SO WE RATED CRAZY HORSE     
            AN 85,              

37:34.352 --> 37:36.319
        VERSUS THE 81.          

37:36.387 --> 37:37.487
    - OKAY, WE'RE UP.           

37:37.555 --> 37:38.788
    WE'VE ENTERED IN            
    THE "X" FACTORS.            

37:38.856 --> 37:40.423
WE'VE GOT OUR HARD DATA.        
      LET'S RUN THE SIM.        

37:40.491 --> 37:42.492
          - LET'S GO.           

37:42.560 --> 37:45.729
     - IT'S TIME TO LAUNCH      
    A FIVE-ON-FIVE BATTLE.      

37:45.796 --> 37:47.764
 CRAZY HORSE AND FOUR LAKOTAS   

37:47.832 --> 37:50.533
     TAKE ON PANCHO VILLA       
     PLUS FOUR <i>VILLISTAS.</i>       

38:16.994 --> 38:21.031
         - [whooping]           

38:21.098 --> 38:25.802
     - [speaks in Spanish]      

38:25.870 --> 38:28.171
      [Lakotas whooping]        

38:31.075 --> 38:32.976
         - [whooping]           

38:33.044 --> 38:36.713
        [all shouting]          

39:05.710 --> 39:08.611
         [tense music]          

39:08.679 --> 39:11.314
         [twig snaps]           

39:11.382 --> 39:12.515
          [rustling]            

39:12.583 --> 39:15.251
            - AGH!              

39:15.319 --> 39:16.853
      [bullet ricochets]        

39:21.425 --> 39:22.625
      [bullet ricochets]        

39:24.061 --> 39:25.095
          - [grunts]            

39:25.162 --> 39:26.596
            - AGH!              

39:26.664 --> 39:28.098
             YAH!               

39:28.165 --> 39:29.966
     [bullets ricocheting]      

39:36.807 --> 39:38.742
      [horses whinnying]        

39:43.414 --> 39:45.682
            - UGH!              

39:45.750 --> 39:47.350
            - YAH!              

39:47.418 --> 39:48.251
     [bullets ricocheting]      

39:56.761 --> 39:59.963
      [gunshots continue]       

40:06.971 --> 40:08.171
            - UGH!              

40:15.346 --> 40:16.846
            - YAH!              

40:16.914 --> 40:19.149
        [both shouting]         

40:23.154 --> 40:25.989
            - YAH!              

40:26.056 --> 40:28.625
 [both shouting and grunting]   

40:40.671 --> 40:44.474
        - AH, <i>VICTORIA!</i>         

40:44.542 --> 40:46.042
    - PANCHO VILLA TRIUMPHS     

40:46.110 --> 40:47.677
         IN THE 5,000           
      SIMULATED BATTLES,        

40:47.745 --> 40:51.948
     WITH 2,684 VICTORIES.      

40:52.016 --> 40:55.285
PANCHO'S WINCHESTER RIFLE       
        AND BOLO KNIFE          

40:55.352 --> 40:56.686
         WON THE DAY,           

40:56.754 --> 40:59.756
      WHILE CRAZY HORSE'S       
        1873 COLT               

40:59.824 --> 41:03.226
    OUTSHOT PANCHO'S            
    BISLEY REVOLVER.            

41:03.294 --> 41:04.828
    IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS,      

41:04.895 --> 41:08.565
  THE "X" FACTOR OF LOGISTICS   
HELPED CARRY PANCHO TO VICTORY. 

41:08.632 --> 41:11.468
 CRAZY HORSE JUST DID NOT HAVE  
         THE SUPPLIES           

41:11.535 --> 41:13.703
    THAT PANCHO VILLA DID.      

41:13.771 --> 41:16.339
PANCHO VILLA'S LOGISTICS        
      WERE MUCH STRONGER        

41:16.407 --> 41:17.707
      THAN CRAZY HORSE'S,       

41:17.775 --> 41:19.709
      WHO WAS SCAVENGING        
  MOSTLY OFF THE BATTLEFIELD.   

41:19.777 --> 41:21.478
         FOR EXAMPLE,           

41:21.545 --> 41:22.745
      YOU WOULD GO, "OH,        
     DISEASE IS GONNA PLAY      

41:22.813 --> 41:23.746
    A MAJOR FACTOR."            

41:23.814 --> 41:25.081
     BUT THEN YOU GO, "OH,      

41:25.149 --> 41:26.749
     BUT PANCHO VILLA HAS       
A MEDICAL SUPPLY TRAIN."        

41:26.817 --> 41:28.451
         - IF YOU GOT           
     THE BETTER RESOURCES,      

41:28.519 --> 41:29.752
     THE BETTER TRAINING,       
THE BETTER MEDICAL CREW,        

41:29.820 --> 41:31.421
  MAKES SENSE YOU SHOULD WIN.   

41:31.489 --> 41:34.123
 - EVEN THOUGH CRAZY HORSE HAS  
          THE HEART--           

41:34.191 --> 41:36.259
    I MEAN, HE'S GOT            
      THE WARRIOR ETHOS--       

41:36.327 --> 41:37.894
    IT'S PANCHO VILLA           
    THAT GOT WHAT HE NEEDED     

41:37.962 --> 41:39.496
        TO GET IT DONE          
      ON THE BATTLEFIELD.       

41:39.563 --> 41:41.764
  [men grunting and shouting]   

41:41.832 --> 41:42.966
     HE WALKED A FINE LINE      

41:43.033 --> 41:46.269
        BETWEEN BANDIT          
      AND REVOLUTIONARY.        

41:46.337 --> 41:48.805
      AND HE FOUND A WAY        
  TO NAVIGATE IT PRETTY WELL.   

41:48.873 --> 41:50.206
         AND, I MEAN,           
HE'S A NATIONAL HERO NOW.       

41:50.274 --> 41:52.842
          - <i>VICTORIA!</i>           

41:52.843 --> 41:55.512
