WEBVTT

00:11.633 --> 00:14.833
- GREAT PRACTICE, TAYLOR.
- THANKS, LILLY.

00:14.867 --> 00:16.833
- I'M SO PSYCHED YOU'RE JOINING
OUR GYMNASTICS TEAM.

00:16.867 --> 00:19.433
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE
BEING A FIGHTING INCHWORM.

00:19.467 --> 00:21.567
- I ALREADY DO.
AT MY LAST SCHOOL,

00:21.600 --> 00:22.600
THE MASCOT WAS THE SQUIRRELS.

00:22.633 --> 00:23.767
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS

00:23.800 --> 00:25.367
TO LOOK COOL WHILE DOING THIS?

00:29.700 --> 00:31.000
- PSST, TAYLOR.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.567
I LEFT MY PHONE
ON PINCH MODE.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.900
IT'S A THING.
I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

00:38.933 --> 00:42.300
MILES, I HAVE COMPANY.

00:42.333 --> 00:43.733
- BUT THEY CAN'T SEE ME.

00:43.767 --> 00:45.433
ONLY PEOPLE WHO LIVE
IN THE HOUSE, REMEMBER?

00:48.833 --> 00:50.900
DO YOU REMEMBER HOW WE TALKED
ABOUT SNEAKING UP ON ME

00:50.933 --> 00:53.467
AND BEING ALL GHOSTY?

00:53.500 --> 00:56.667
- GREAT FEEDBACK.
I'LL TAKE A NOTE.

00:56.700 --> 01:00.400
LESS GHOSTY.

01:04.567 --> 01:06.067
- YOUR MOM SAYS
SHE NEEDS YOU UPSTAIRS

01:06.067 --> 01:07.533
TO HELP UNPACK.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.333
SO WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT DOWN HERE?

01:10.367 --> 01:11.900
- BYE, MILES.

01:13.933 --> 01:16.633
SORRY, GUYS.
I HAVE TO GET GOING.

01:16.667 --> 01:19.867
- NO PROBLEM.
BUT BEFORE YOU DO,

01:19.900 --> 01:20.867
WE HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.667
- A BIG SURPRISE.

01:22.700 --> 01:24.500
- IT'S A TRADITION
TO HAVE A SLEEPOVER

01:24.533 --> 01:25.833
WHEN A NEW INCHWORM
JOINS THE TEAM.

01:25.867 --> 01:27.333
- TOTAL TRADITION.

01:27.367 --> 01:30.600
WHOO-HOO!

01:30.633 --> 01:32.067
- EMMA'S EXCITED ABOUT IT.

01:32.067 --> 01:34.767
- I AM.

01:34.800 --> 01:37.733
- THAT'S AWESOME.
I LOVE SLEEPOVERS.

01:37.767 --> 01:39.300
- GREAT.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

01:39.333 --> 01:40.633
- TONIGHT TOTALLY WORKS FOR ME.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.700
- GREAT.
WE'LL BE HERE AT 6:00?

01:42.733 --> 01:45.067
COME HERE?

01:45.100 --> 01:46.733
- IT'S A TRADITION.

01:46.767 --> 01:48.767
THE NEWEST INCHWORM
ALWAYS HOSTS THE SLEEPOVER.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.967
OH, I CAN'T.

01:51.067 --> 01:56.700
I'VE GOT A THING AT THE THING
WITH A THING.

01:56.733 --> 01:59.067
SO MANY THINGS.

01:59.067 --> 02:03.567
- TAYLOR, IS THERE SOME REASON
YOU DON'T WANT US COMING OVER?

02:03.600 --> 02:05.767
- I FORGOT MY PENCIL.

02:06.933 --> 02:09.067
- CAN'T THINK OF ONE.

02:09.067 --> 02:11.633
- THEN WE'LL BE HERE TONIGHT.

02:11.667 --> 02:13.900
AND BY TOMORROW
YOU'LL BE AN OFFICIAL INCHWORM.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.600
- OR THE OFFICIAL WEIRDO
WHO LIVES WITH GHOSTS.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.900
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:26.933 --> 02:29.933
* YOU'VE GOT TO TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:29.967 --> 02:32.500
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:32.533 --> 02:36.067
both: * YOU GOT TO BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:36.067 --> 02:38.467
* DON'T KNOW HOW WE ENDED UP
THIS WAY *

02:38.500 --> 02:42.600
* BUT GUESS YOU COULD CALL US
THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS *

02:42.633 --> 02:45.667
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:45.700 --> 02:48.067
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:48.067 --> 02:51.333
*

02:51.367 --> 02:54.767
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

03:01.067 --> 03:02.667
- THANKS FOR HELPING US
MOVE IN, GUYS.

03:02.700 --> 03:05.900
YOU LIGHTEN THE LOAD LITERALLY.

03:05.933 --> 03:08.900
- HEY.
WHAT ARE GHOSTS FOR?

03:08.933 --> 03:11.167
- UM, SCARING.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.700
ANYTHING BUT HELPING.

03:12.733 --> 03:14.300
THIS IS A TRAVESTY.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.133
GHOSTS SHOULD BE FEARED.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.967
- OKAY, LOUIE,
BUT THE LITTLE DUCKIES

03:20.067 --> 03:21.933
ON YOUR SOCKS
ARE NOT HELPING.

03:21.967 --> 03:26.767
- THEY AREN'T DUCKIES.
THEY'RE YELLOW MONSTERS.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.600
OH.

03:29.633 --> 03:31.200
- WE ALL KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL, SON,

03:31.233 --> 03:33.833
BUT REGARDLESS WE AGREED
TO SHARE THE HOUSE

03:33.867 --> 03:35.767
WITH MICHELLE AND THE GIRLS.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.233
- THAT'S RIGHT.
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS WORK.

03:37.267 --> 03:38.933
I PROMISE.
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW WE'RE HERE.

03:38.967 --> 03:40.167
- MOM!

03:40.200 --> 03:42.200
- STARTING
AFTER WHATEVER THIS IS.

03:42.233 --> 03:44.867
- MOM, THE GYMNASTICS TEAM
IS COMING OVER

03:44.900 --> 03:46.200
FOR A SLEEPOVER TONIGHT.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.233
- THAT'S GREAT.

03:47.267 --> 03:49.867
THAT'S HORRIBLE?

03:49.900 --> 03:52.500
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME?
I'M NOT GOOD AT READING YOU.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.233
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE KIDS
AT SCHOOL WOULD SAY

03:54.267 --> 03:56.067
IF THEY FOUND OUT
I LIVE WITH GHOSTS?

03:56.067 --> 03:58.133
NO OFFENSE.

04:00.067 --> 04:01.233
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.667
IF THEY SAW SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

04:03.700 --> 04:07.567
MY SUPREME AWESOMENESS?

04:07.600 --> 04:11.067
- ARE THOSE YELLOW DUCKIES
ON YOUR SOCKS?

04:11.067 --> 04:12.333
- FORGET IT.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.800
- TAYLOR, HAVE YOUR SLEEPOVER.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.067
MY BOYS WILL BEHAVE.
IT'LL BE FINE.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.700
- BETTER THAN FINE.
IT'LL BE GREAT.

04:21.733 --> 04:26.167
SO WHAT TIME SHOULD I SWING BY?

04:26.200 --> 04:31.067
- MILES, THIS SLEEPOVER
IS FOR MY GYMNASTICS TEAM.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.633
- COME ON, TAY.

04:32.667 --> 04:34.300
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG IT'S BEEN

04:34.333 --> 04:36.067
SINCE I'VE BEEN TO A PARTY?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.067
- IT'S NOT REALLY A PARTY.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.833
- IT WILL BE
WHEN I GET THERE.

04:39.867 --> 04:42.233
HE SAID WHAT?

04:43.667 --> 04:45.133
HE'LL BE THE HIT OF THE PARTY.

04:45.167 --> 04:46.833
- MOM.
- TAYLOR.

04:46.867 --> 04:48.633
RAY'S RIGHT.
IF WE'RE GONNA SHARE THIS HOUSE,

04:48.667 --> 04:50.133
WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
TO BE FLEXIBLE

04:50.167 --> 04:51.833
AND MAKE COMPROMISES.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.267
- OKAY, FINE.
- YES!

04:54.300 --> 04:56.933
- WHEN I SAY, "PARTY,"
YOU SAY, "MILES."

04:56.967 --> 04:59.167
PARTY.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.100
MILES.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.267
WE'LL PICK THIS UP LATER.

05:09.067 --> 05:12.600
- OH.
THOSE ARE MY MANNEQUIN HEADS.

05:12.633 --> 05:15.633
- FRANKIE, WHY DO YOU HAVE
MANNEQUIN HEADS?

05:18.333 --> 05:22.833
- I'M GONNA KEEP MY EYE ON YOU.

05:22.867 --> 05:24.833
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE THESE
TO YOUR ROOM.

05:24.867 --> 05:27.900
- THANKS, RAY. IT'S THE BIG ONE
AT THE END OF THE HALL.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.567
- NICE TRY, FRANKIE.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.767
MOM, I'M OLDER.
I SHOULD GET THE BIGGER ROOM.

05:31.800 --> 05:33.067
- I'M WITH TAYLOR
ON THIS.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.100
SHE'S GOT SENIORITY.

05:34.133 --> 05:35.833
- FINE.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.300
BUT THIS ISN'T OVER.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.133
AND, REMEMBER,

05:39.167 --> 05:41.567
I KNOW WHERE YOU SLEEP.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.200
- ME TOO.
THE BIG ROOM.

05:49.067 --> 05:52.067
- OKAY, SON, CONCENTRATE
ON THE GHOST BALLOON

05:52.067 --> 05:53.200
AND THE TARGET.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.867
NOW THE KEY TO MOVING OBJECTS

05:54.900 --> 05:56.567
IS FOCUS.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.800
- BE THE WATER BALLOON, LOUIE.

06:04.667 --> 06:06.967
OKAY.

06:07.067 --> 06:10.900
SO LET'S TALK
ABOUT WHAT WENT WRONG THERE.

06:10.933 --> 06:13.600
I'M NEVER GONNA GET THIS.

06:13.633 --> 06:17.167
- LOOK, SON,
THIS IS WHY WE DO DRILLS.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.567
YOU'LL GET BETTER.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.067
BUT ONLY IF YOU PRACTICE.

06:20.067 --> 06:22.133
- I SHOULD BE PRACTICING
ON REAL PEOPLE,

06:22.167 --> 06:27.233
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW, THE ONES
LIVING IN OUR HOUSE.

06:27.267 --> 06:30.767
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S HARD
FOR YOU, LOUIE,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.767
BUT WE MADE A PROMISE
NOT TO SCARE AWAY THE HATHAWAYS.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.067
YOU'LL SEE.
LIVING WITH THEM WILL BE FINE.

06:39.100 --> 06:42.500
STARTING AFTER
WHATEVER THIS IS.

06:42.533 --> 06:44.533
BE RIGHT BACK.

06:46.967 --> 06:48.067
- HELLO.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.800
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF KNOCKING?

06:52.833 --> 06:56.567
- I COULDN'T HELP BUT OVERHEAR
YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.067
- THAT WAS ONE TIME.

06:58.067 --> 07:00.733
I DRANK A LOT OF WATER
BEFORE I WENT TO BED.

07:00.767 --> 07:03.067
- NOT THAT.

07:03.067 --> 07:04.767
YOUR LITTLE PROBLEM
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE

07:04.800 --> 07:06.167
TO PRACTICE YOUR GHOSTING.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.600
I THINK I HAVE THE SOLUTION.

07:08.633 --> 07:10.333
- DO YOU THINK I NEED
A LITTLE GIRL

07:10.367 --> 07:12.200
TO HELP ME SOLVE MY PROBLEMS?

07:12.233 --> 07:15.333
- WE BOTH KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

07:15.367 --> 07:17.233
IF YOU WANT TO PRACTICE,

07:17.267 --> 07:19.167
YOU SHOULD HAUNT
MY SISTER'S SLEEPOVER.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.900
- BUT I PROMISED MY DAD
I WOULDN'T SCARE YOU GUYS.

07:21.933 --> 07:24.933
- RIGHT, BUT TAYLOR'S FRIENDS
ARE FAIR GAME,

07:24.967 --> 07:27.933
AND THEY'LL ALL
BE HERE TONIGHT

07:27.967 --> 07:33.200
IN HER BIG, STUPID ROOM THAT
SHE VICIOUSLY STOLE FROM ME.

07:33.233 --> 07:37.333
- SO I COULD SCARE THE SNOT
OUT OF THOSE GIRLS

07:37.367 --> 07:39.767
AND SHOW MY DAD
I'VE GOT GAME.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.067
LET'S DO THIS.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.067
IT'S TIME TO TURN
THESE INCHWORMS

07:43.100 --> 07:45.800
INTO FLINCHWORMS.

07:45.833 --> 07:48.100
THAT WAS GOOD.

07:48.133 --> 07:51.167
NOTE TO SELF:
COPYRIGHT "FLINCHWORMS."

07:55.533 --> 07:56.700
- COME ON.

07:56.733 --> 07:58.100
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.800
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:59.833 --> 08:00.933
- I THOUGHT THE PIANO MIGHT LOOK

08:00.967 --> 08:02.567
A LITTLE BETTER TO THE LEFT

08:02.600 --> 08:05.067
AND ON THE CURB.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.733
- THIS PIANO ISN'T GOING
ON THE CURB.

08:07.767 --> 08:10.067
I PLAYED THIS BEAUTY
IN FOUR DIFFERENT BANDS.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.067
- IT'S JUST THAT IT'S TAKING UP
A LOT OF MY LIVING ROOM.

08:13.067 --> 08:14.567
- OUR LIVING ROOM.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.767
- YEAH, MOM.
RAY'S RIGHT.

08:16.800 --> 08:19.267
IF WE'RE ALL GOING TO GET ALONG,
WE HAVE TO MAKE COMPROMISES

08:19.300 --> 08:21.567
AND BE FLEXIBLE, RIGHT?

08:21.600 --> 08:24.633
- DON'T YOU HAVE A SLEEPOVER
TO GET READY FOR?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.767
- THE GIRLS WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.967
NOTHING'S FLOATING OR FLYING.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.233
I GUESS THAT'S GOOD.

08:30.267 --> 08:32.733
- SWEETIE, YOU JUST NEED
TO RELAX

08:32.767 --> 08:34.600
AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

08:34.633 --> 08:36.833
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'LL BE FINE.

08:36.867 --> 08:38.333
THEY'RE HERE.

08:38.367 --> 08:39.867
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

08:39.900 --> 08:41.167
TELL 'EM I MOVED TO MEXICO.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.200
- TAYLOR, THE DOOR.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.800
- SO ABOUT THE PIANO...
- MM-HMM.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.867
- I BET YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND
IF YOU KNEW HOW TO PLAY.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.833
LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW LESSONS,

08:52.867 --> 08:54.200
AND, IF YOU DON'T FALL
IN LOVE WITH IT,

08:54.233 --> 08:55.933
THE PIANO GOES.

08:55.967 --> 08:58.833
- FINE.
I'LL BE FLEXIBLE.

08:58.867 --> 09:03.833
* THIS IS ME
PLAYING A SCALE *

09:03.867 --> 09:08.200
- * THIS IS ME
LOSING MY MIND *

09:10.367 --> 09:12.167
- I DON'T KNOW
IF HE LIKES ME.

09:12.200 --> 09:16.067
HE ALWAYS LOOKS AT ME,
BUT HE NEVER SAYS ANYTHING.

09:16.100 --> 09:19.700
- EMMA, HE'S YOUR DOG.

09:24.233 --> 09:25.300
- I BROUGHT GRAHAM CRACKERS

09:25.333 --> 09:28.867
AND MY BOOK OF GHOST STORIES.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.633
- PHONE CALL.

09:30.667 --> 09:32.900
MILES, CAN YOU BE
MORE CAREFUL?

09:32.933 --> 09:35.167
THEY MAY NOT SEE YOU, BUT THEY
CAN SEE THINGS FLOATING.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.333
- SORRY.
I'M STILL ADJUSTING

09:37.367 --> 09:39.867
TO THIS WHOLE
"LIVING WITH NON-GHOSTS" THING.

09:39.900 --> 09:43.067
SO WHAT GOES ON AT THESE THINGS?

09:43.100 --> 09:44.800
PILLOW FIGHT?

09:44.833 --> 09:46.300
- NO.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.167
GOOD,
'CAUSE THAT DOES NOT SOUND FUN

09:48.200 --> 09:50.167
TO ME AT ALL.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.967
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

09:54.067 --> 09:55.333
- I DON'T KNOW.
HANG OUT.

09:55.367 --> 09:57.167
WE CAN KEEP THINGS CHILL.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.700
OR...

10:03.967 --> 10:06.067
IT'S PARTY TIME.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.967
HOW PSYCHED ARE YOU
THAT I'M HERE?

10:14.067 --> 10:16.667
- OKAY. YOU READY
TO GET YOUR SCARE ON?

10:18.167 --> 10:20.267
LOUIE'S THE NAME,
AND SCARING'S MY GAME.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.600
I GOT MORE BOOS THAN SHOES.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.567
I'M THE GHOST WITH THE MOST.

10:24.600 --> 10:28.200
THE PHANTOM WITH THE--

10:28.233 --> 10:30.900
THE GIRLS ARE ONLY HERE
FOR TEN HOURS.

10:37.267 --> 10:40.167
- OH, MY GOSH, EMMA AND I
JUST WATCHED THAT LAST WEEK.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.033
IT'S LIKE OUR FAVORITE MOVIE.

10:42.067 --> 10:45.933
- THE END, WHEN LUCAS PROPOSES
TO APRIL IN FRONT OF EVERYONE

10:45.967 --> 10:49.267
AT THE LAKE.

10:49.300 --> 10:52.967
- WHOA!
SPOILER ALERT.

10:53.000 --> 10:56.200
THAT'S SO EMMA.

10:56.233 --> 10:59.633
- ALL RIGHT.
HERE'S HOW IT'S GOING DOWN.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.933
WHILE THEY WATCH THE MOVIE,

11:00.967 --> 11:03.667
YOU'RE GONNA SNEAK
INTO THE TV,

11:03.700 --> 11:06.800
THEN JUMP OUT
WHEN THEY LEAST EXPECT IT.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.100
- BUT HOW WILL THEY SEE ME
COME OUT OF THE TV?

11:09.133 --> 11:10.800
I'M INVISIBLE TO THEM.

11:10.833 --> 11:16.067
- YOU'LL BE WEARING THIS.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.733
I MADE MY GRANDMOTHER FAINT
WITH THAT MASK.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.933
GOOD TIMES.

11:24.167 --> 11:27.700
- JUST A GIRL WITH
A SLIGHTLY SMALLER BEDROOM.

11:27.733 --> 11:31.767
FOR NOW.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.067
- THEY'RE GOING TO KISS.

11:34.067 --> 11:35.833
- YEAH, KISS
THE BAD BOY, APRIL.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.067
GOOD MOVE.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.267
HOPE THAT WORKS OUT FOR YOU.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.833
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
I ACTUALLY THINK

11:41.867 --> 11:43.500
THIS COULD BE A GOOD NIGHT.

11:43.533 --> 11:47.067
- READY OR NOT,
IT'S LOUIE TIME.

12:00.567 --> 12:04.067
- EVERYONE, TRY TO RELAX.

12:04.067 --> 12:05.100
- I THINK I'M STUCK IN HERE.

12:05.133 --> 12:06.867
HELP!

12:06.900 --> 12:10.533
HELP!
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS NOT COOL.

12:13.300 --> 12:16.467
- PHONE CALL.
I'M POPULAR TONIGHT.

12:16.500 --> 12:19.433
MILES, WHAT IS YOUR BROTHER
TRYING TO PULL?

12:19.467 --> 12:22.800
- I'M NOT SURE, BUT HE'S
TOTALLY GONNA RUIN OUR PARTY.

12:24.100 --> 12:27.267
- OH, RIGHT.
SLEEPOVER.

12:27.300 --> 12:28.733
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HIM.

12:28.767 --> 12:30.800
THIS ENDS NOW.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.467
- TAKE ME WITH YOU.

12:41.500 --> 12:44.367
- WELL, RAY,
WHAT CAN I SAY?

12:44.400 --> 12:45.467
YOU WERE RIGHT.

12:45.500 --> 12:47.133
I AM LOVING THIS.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.067
- ALL RIGHT, THEN,
THE PIANO STAYS.

12:49.067 --> 12:52.867
WHY DON'T WE PICK UP THIS LESSON
AGAIN IN, SAY, SIX MONTHS?

12:54.200 --> 12:55.833
I AM TOTALLY HOOKED.

12:55.867 --> 12:58.067
I'M GOING TO BE PRACTICING
EACH AND EVERY DAY

12:58.067 --> 12:59.467
FOR HOURS AND HOURS.

13:01.867 --> 13:04.800
OH, LOOK AT YOU
GETTING EMOTIONAL.

13:04.833 --> 13:09.567
- MM-HMM, THIS EXPERIENCE
HAS AFFECTED ME.

13:14.433 --> 13:16.800
- THAT FISH MASK
MESSED UP MY POWERS.

13:16.833 --> 13:20.933
- YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

13:23.167 --> 13:25.200
- WELL, WELL.

13:25.233 --> 13:27.800
IF IT ISN'T THE SCARE BEARS.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.067
LOOK, YOU TWO,

13:30.067 --> 13:32.133
I FINALLY HAVE SOMETHING COOL
TO DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT,

13:32.167 --> 13:34.333
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
RUIN IT.

13:34.367 --> 13:37.333
- YOU CAN'T PROVE
I WAS IN THAT TV.

13:37.367 --> 13:41.300
I MEAN, WHAT TV?

13:41.333 --> 13:44.700
- LISTEN,
THE HAUNTING ENDS NOW.

13:44.733 --> 13:47.067
THIS PARTY'S IMPORTANT
TO TAYLOR.

13:47.067 --> 13:49.700
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:49.733 --> 13:51.100
WE WERE BEING INSENSITIVE.

13:51.133 --> 13:54.433
WE'LL STAY AWAY, MILES.
WE PROMISE.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.400
- HMM.
WASN'T EXPECTING THAT,

13:56.433 --> 13:59.233
BUT LOVING THE ATTITUDE,
FRANKENBERRY.

13:59.267 --> 14:03.367
- THANKS SO MUCH
FOR SETTING US STRAIGHT.

14:06.367 --> 14:09.400
WHAT A SAP.

14:09.433 --> 14:13.200
OKAY, PLAN "B," SCARING THE POOP
OUT OF THOSE GIRLS.

14:14.433 --> 14:17.333
THAT TV STUNT
WAS A DISASTER.

14:17.367 --> 14:18.967
I'M JUST GLAD
MY DAD DIDN'T SEE IT.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.133
I'LL NEVER BE
A GREAT GHOST.

14:21.167 --> 14:23.867
- HEY, THAT'S QUITTER TALK.

14:23.900 --> 14:26.067
ARE WE GOING
TO LET MILES AND TAYLOR

14:26.067 --> 14:28.933
PUSH US YOUNGER KIDS AROUND
AND TAKE OUR BEDROOMS?

14:28.967 --> 14:31.433
- NO!
WAIT, BEDROOMS?

14:31.467 --> 14:33.267
- EXACTLY.
US YOUNGER KIDS

14:33.300 --> 14:34.700
HAVE TO STICK TOGETHER.

14:34.733 --> 14:35.833
WHEN THE GHOSTING GETS TOUGH,

14:35.867 --> 14:37.300
THE TOUGH GET GHOSTING.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.700
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO ONE TELLS LOUIE WHAT TO DO

14:40.733 --> 14:43.467
BUT LOUIE...AND MY DAD

14:43.500 --> 14:46.433
AND MY GRANDMA
WHEN SHE'S VISITING.

14:46.467 --> 14:48.133
BUT THAT'S IT.

14:48.167 --> 14:52.133
THIS SLEEPOVER IS ABOUT TO
TURN INTO A CREEPOVER.

14:52.167 --> 14:54.400
FLINCHWORMS, CREEPOVER.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.933
I'M ON FIRE TONIGHT.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.233
OH, COME ON.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

15:10.067 --> 15:13.067
OH, WOW, THAT IS A LOT
OF GARLIC.

15:16.133 --> 15:18.833
- OKAY, WE'RE BACK ON TRACK.

15:18.867 --> 15:21.333
IS THIS GOING GREAT OR WHAT?

15:21.367 --> 15:24.333
- WOW. IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN TO A PARTY.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.900
- THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S TIME FOR?

15:26.933 --> 15:28.467
- DO NOT SAY PILLOW FIGHT.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.767
WHY WOULD I SAY IT

15:29.800 --> 15:31.167
WHEN I CAN DO IT?

15:31.200 --> 15:33.267
- MILES, STOP IT.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.500
SERIOUSLY.

15:41.067 --> 15:43.500
YEAH.
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

15:46.433 --> 15:49.700
MILES!
LOOK WHAT YOU MADE ME DO.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.067
- SORRY.

15:52.833 --> 15:56.933
WAIT.
YOU NAME YOUR PILLOW TOO?

16:02.800 --> 16:04.533
- OH, I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.800
GHOSTS ARE ABLE
TO CREATE ILLUSIONS

16:06.833 --> 16:08.267
THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.933
SO I'M GONNA APPEAR TO THEM

16:09.967 --> 16:11.967
AS A FIRE-BREATHING MONSTER.

16:12.067 --> 16:13.900
- WHOA.
YOU CAN DO THAT?

16:13.933 --> 16:17.967
- SCARY MONSTER
ABOUT TO POUNCE.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.067
- IS THIS WHAT SLUMBER PARTIES
ARE LIKE IN NEW YORK?

16:26.067 --> 16:30.867
- TAYLOR, WHY IS THERE A GOAT IN
YOUR ROOM WEARING A COWBOY HAT?

16:30.900 --> 16:35.067
- I ALWAYS SAY IT'S NOT A PARTY
TILL THE GOAT SHOWS UP.

16:35.067 --> 16:37.900
- TAYLOR, I'M REALLY STARTING
TO GET WEIRDED OUT.

16:37.933 --> 16:40.333
THERE'S SOME ODD STUFF
GOING ON IN THIS HOUSE.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.100
- MAYBE WE SHOULD GO HOME.

16:42.133 --> 16:44.867
- YEAH.

16:44.900 --> 16:49.300
- HEY, SO YOU GUYS NEVER DISCUSS
WHAT HAPPENS AT SLEEPOVERS

16:49.333 --> 16:51.900
AT SCHOOL, DO YOU?

16:51.933 --> 16:54.300
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

16:54.333 --> 16:58.467
- WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU, TAYLOR.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.233
- DON'T WORRY, TAY.
I GOT THIS.

17:04.067 --> 17:06.833
TRUST ME.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.833
JUST READ.
I'LL DO SOUND EFFECTS.

17:08.867 --> 17:10.933
WE COULD SAVE THIS.

17:10.967 --> 17:12.733
- GIRLS, WAIT.

17:12.767 --> 17:16.233
YOU CAN'T LEAVE
BEFORE WE READ A GHOST STORY.

17:16.267 --> 17:21.900
THE STORY IS CALLED
THE SWAMP WITCH OF NEW ORLEANS.

17:21.933 --> 17:24.267
"FEEDING ON YOUNG CHILDREN,

17:24.300 --> 17:26.700
SHE TRAVELS ON THE WIND."

17:30.200 --> 17:31.767
- THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.700
- OH, MY GOSH.

17:35.733 --> 17:37.933
THIS IS
TOTALLY FREAKING ME OUT.

17:37.967 --> 17:41.900
KEEP READING.

17:48.333 --> 17:50.900
- YEAH, I WAS EMBARRASSED
FOR YOU IN THAT ONE TOO.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.467
- I'M SICK OF MESSING UP.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.267
I JUST WISH ONE OF MY SCARES
WOULD GO RIGHT.

17:57.400 --> 17:59.200
- NO, I'M NOT OKAY.

17:59.233 --> 18:02.067
I'M TRYING TO BE SCARY,
AND I CAN'T.

18:04.467 --> 18:07.533
- I TRIED FOR A MONSTER
AND GOT A GOAT.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.933
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

18:12.967 --> 18:17.333
THIS PIANO LESSON IS OVER.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.433
- WHOA, LOUIE.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.067
YOU DID THAT?

18:25.067 --> 18:27.067
- I DID.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.700
I MEAN TO WRAP
THOSE CURTAINS AROUND HER,

18:29.733 --> 18:30.733
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

18:30.767 --> 18:34.267
DAD, I DID IT.
- LOUIE!

18:34.300 --> 18:39.133
- NOW, SON, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT TO MICHELLE.

18:39.167 --> 18:41.133
BUT BLESS YOU.

18:42.900 --> 18:46.700
- LOUIE, GET ME
OUT OF THESE NOW.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.767
- YES, MY DAD SAW ME
BE AN AWESOME GHOST.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.067
VICTORY DANCE.

18:51.067 --> 18:54.067
- LOUIE.

18:54.067 --> 18:57.167
LOUIE.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.867
- "AS THE SWAMP WITCH
GOT CLOSER,

18:59.900 --> 19:03.100
THE GIRLS COULD HEAR
HER FOOTSTEPS ON THE STAIRS."

19:08.067 --> 19:13.200
"HER ANGUISHED CRIES GOT LOUDER
UNTIL FINALLY SHE SCREAMED."

19:13.233 --> 19:15.500
WHERE'S THE LITTLE ONE?

19:19.500 --> 19:22.533
- THE SWAMP WITCH!
SHE'S COME FOR US!

19:22.567 --> 19:25.433
TAKE EMMA!

19:31.967 --> 19:34.067
- SO I JUST CAME FROM PRACTICE.

19:34.100 --> 19:35.900
- YIKES, SWEETIE.
WAS IT ROUGH?

19:35.933 --> 19:38.500
I'M SORRY I CHASED AWAY
ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

19:38.533 --> 19:40.233
- DON'T BE SORRY.

19:40.267 --> 19:41.867
EVERYBODY LOVED IT.

19:41.900 --> 19:43.967
THEY'RE CALLING IT
THE BEST SLEEPOVER EVER.

19:44.067 --> 19:47.100
A FEW PARENTS HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU.

19:47.133 --> 19:48.967
BUT THE HAUNTED HOUSE THEME
WAS A HIT.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.233
CHECK IT OUT.

19:50.267 --> 19:53.100
I'M AN OFFICIAL INCHWORM.
- NICE.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.900
YOU DESERVE IT.
- THANKS.

19:54.933 --> 19:56.333
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

19:56.367 --> 19:59.500
AND I REALLY AM GLAD
YOU CAME TO MY SLEEPOVER.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.000
- ME TOO.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.400
- SEE, AND YOU THOUGHT

20:02.433 --> 20:04.467
LIVING WITH GHOSTS
WOULD BE WEIRD.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.000
- YEAH.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

20:09.800 --> 20:13.700
- DAD'S GOT YOU
ON CLEANING DUTY, HUH?

20:13.733 --> 20:17.033
- MAYBE HE'LL THINK TWICE BEFORE
TYING ME UP WITH CURTAINS.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.867
- YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
YOUR FACE.

20:19.900 --> 20:23.733
YOUR PRETTY, PRETTY FACE.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.433
- FRANKIE, THERE YOU ARE.

20:26.467 --> 20:28.200
SO I'VE BEEN THINKING,

20:28.233 --> 20:30.267
AND I'VE DECIDED
TO GIVE YOU THE BIGGER ROOM.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.733
- YOU TRULY DESERVE IT.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.367
- YES! I HAD A FEELING
YOU'D COME TO YOUR SENSES

20:35.400 --> 20:36.467
AND DO THE RIGHT THING.

20:36.500 --> 20:39.100
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:39.133 --> 20:43.200
- THAT ROOM STILL REEKS
OF GARLIC DIP, DOESN'T IT?

20:43.233 --> 20:45.767
- OH, YEAH.
THAT SMELL'S NEVER COMING OUT.

20:55.133 --> 20:58.500
I THINK
I'M GETTING EVEN BETTER.

20:58.533 --> 21:00.467
- SMILE, EVERYBODY.

21:00.500 --> 21:03.500
SHE HAS NO IDEA
WE CAN'T HEAR HER.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.067
- NOW THAT'S
MY KIND OF GHOSTING.
