00:14.318 --> 00:15.754
What you watching, Mol?

00:15.841 --> 00:19.236
Oh, a documentary on,
uh, natural childbirth

00:19.323 --> 00:20.455
when I do finally get pregnant

00:20.542 --> 00:22.109
I want to know
what all my options are.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.762
Well, I'm gonna do it
the old-fashioned way

00:23.849 --> 00:25.068
loaded on painkillers,
screaming

00:25.155 --> 00:27.070
"Get this thing out of me!"

00:27.157 --> 00:28.985
Well, that's always
a fallback, but..

00:29.072 --> 00:32.249
I'm actually curious about
this underwater birthing.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.686
Oh, that's why
she's squatting naked

00:34.773 --> 00:36.949
in that swimming pool.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.690
Correct. Yeah.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.823
They say that the warm water
helps relax you

00:40.910 --> 00:42.520
and, you know, makes for a..

00:42.607 --> 00:44.740
...a less traumatic
transition for the baby.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.959
Sure. I guess, as long as
all the other people

00:47.047 --> 00:49.527
at the pool don't mind.

00:49.614 --> 00:51.573
No, you're not doing it
at the Y.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.270
They won't even let you swim
without a cap..

00:53.357 --> 00:56.534
[gasps]
Oh, she's going into labor.

00:56.621 --> 00:57.840
This is so beautiful.

00:57.927 --> 00:59.755
I think I'm getting
a little choked up.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.670
Right.
This really is a miracle.

01:14.117 --> 01:15.901
- Oh, God!
- What are you watching?

01:15.988 --> 01:18.121
Is it shark week again?

01:18.208 --> 01:21.255
No, it's a video
of natural childbirth.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.300
That's horrifying!
Thanks a lot.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.868
I was just going to the kitchen
to get something to eat.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.217
What are you doing now?

01:27.304 --> 01:30.090
Going to the kitchen
to get something to eat.

01:30.177 --> 01:32.570
Forget this. Just pump me
full of drugs and booze.

01:32.657 --> 01:34.442
Done and done.

01:34.529 --> 01:36.661
Oh, my god, she's biting
through the umbilical cord!

01:36.748 --> 01:40.709
Yuck! It's like watching
mike eat calamari.

01:40.796 --> 01:42.667
Seriously, just give me
a spine full of morphine

01:42.754 --> 01:44.974
and a bellyful of hooch,
I want that baby coming out

So, you and molly got any
big plans for Valentine's Day?

02:11.087 --> 02:12.915
We're having dinner at home
and then baby sex

02:13.002 --> 02:15.135
which is just like regular sex
but with half the passion

02:15.222 --> 02:17.876
and twice the worry.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.269
It's still sex, though.

02:19.356 --> 02:20.662
I didn't say bad,
just different.

02:20.749 --> 02:23.665
Like pineapple on pizza.

02:23.752 --> 02:26.015
Since I don't have a special
lady in my life this year

02:26.102 --> 02:27.451
I'm just gonna lay low.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.105
By "laying low,"
you mean driving around

02:29.192 --> 02:32.891
trolling for sad, dateless women
at bus stops and bridges?

02:32.978 --> 02:36.417
If they're ready to jump,
they might as well jump on me.

02:36.504 --> 02:37.461
And pardon me
for caring about ladies

02:37.548 --> 02:38.810
going through a rough patch.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.203
Yeah, you're quite
the humanitarian

02:40.290 --> 02:43.424

a helping penis.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.643
Say whatever you want but
I've cleaned up my act a lot.

02:45.730 --> 02:50.082
It's been a long time since
I've trolled for bus-pass ass.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.476
Not since the "she-male
incident" of '08.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.043
[laughs]

02:54.130 --> 02:57.307
You spent the whole night
crying and gargling.

02:59.353 --> 03:01.833
Learned a lot of lessons
that night.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.487
Which I'm gonna
pass on to Samuel.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.924
That boy is desperate
for an experienced mentor.

03:06.011 --> 03:07.926
Carl, please quit
talking about me

03:08.013 --> 03:10.407
like I'm your make-a-wish kid.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.322
Don't let him drag you
into his sickness.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.238
It's not right taking advantage
of sad, vulnerable women.

03:15.325 --> 03:17.240
Don't listen to him, I got
plans to meet ladies this year

03:17.327 --> 03:20.287
that's so good
it surprised even me.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.419
Alright, but I am not
going to throw myself

03:22.506 --> 03:24.421
in front
of a hot woman's car again.

03:24.508 --> 03:29.470
That was dangerous, stupid,
and she didn't even slow down.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.732
Well, that says
more about society

03:30.819 --> 03:32.255
than it does about the plan.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.343
You take that scheme to Europe

03:33.430 --> 03:35.998
and we'd get all kinds of tail.

03:36.085 --> 03:38.130
Here's an idea, Samuel,
find a girl you like

03:38.218 --> 03:40.307
ask her out on a date...
on your own.

03:40.394 --> 03:43.048
Man, quit filling his head
with crazy ideas!

03:43.135 --> 03:45.312
You're gonna have him going
to singles bars and nightclubs

03:45.399 --> 03:47.575
which is a lot of work,
a lot of money, a lot of talk

03:47.662 --> 03:49.141
and not to mention
the competition.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.014
I do have certain
financial restrictions.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.624
And the accent gets them
to look at me

03:53.711 --> 03:55.496
but eventually they realize
my credit cards

03:55.583 --> 03:58.107
are made of cardboard
and came with my wallet.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.458
That's why you and me
are going off the grid.

04:01.545 --> 04:02.677
A place where lonely women go

04:02.764 --> 04:04.592
to forget all about
Valentine's Day.

04:04.679 --> 04:08.726
You talking a liquor store
or Baskin-Robbins?

04:08.813 --> 04:10.598
Better. A place where
a single man can stroll in

04:10.685 --> 04:11.816
with no agenda other than

04:11.903 --> 04:13.557
"Hey, can I borrow
a cup of detergent?"

04:13.644 --> 04:18.214
Oh, no. You're gonna try
and get laid at a laundromat?

04:18.301 --> 04:21.391
Two quarters in a dryer gets you
30 minutes to chat up a gal.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.611
At a club, you're buying
five-dollar appletinis

04:23.698 --> 04:25.308
which gets you maybe three
minutes and she can walk away

04:25.395 --> 04:28.180
whenever she wants.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.748
That dryer full of underpants
is like a chain around her neck.

04:37.364 --> 04:41.150
I'm sorry, you can't argue
with the math or the logic.

04:42.499 --> 04:46.373
You, sir,
are a perverted genius.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.766
I've got a beautiful,
filthy mind.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.294
Hi. My name's Mike,
and I'm an overeater.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.599
[all]
Hi, Mike.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.384
Well, I sailed
through the holidays

04:57.471 --> 04:59.124
without over-stuffing
my stocking.

04:59.211 --> 05:00.865
And the great thing
about tofurkey is

05:00.952 --> 05:03.172
you never want seconds.

05:03.259 --> 05:07.611
But it did help me lose what
is now a total of 40 pounds.

05:07.698 --> 05:10.005
Did he really crack
the big 4-0?

05:10.092 --> 05:11.398
Actually, thirty-eight
and a half

05:11.485 --> 05:13.878
but I'm gonna let him
have his moment.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.184
But I didn't come here to brag.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.578
Yes, he did.

05:17.665 --> 05:19.884
I'm just here
to inspire and encourage

05:19.971 --> 05:21.973
because if I can do it,
you can do it.

05:22.060 --> 05:24.585
All it takes is submitting
to this simple program

05:24.672 --> 05:26.151
and being married
to a wonderful woman

05:26.238 --> 05:29.372
who will actually
slap pizza out of your hand.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.593
Truthfully, I had to tear it out
of his teeth.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.509
Yeah, it's like getting
a sock away from a dog.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.989
Alright, I think we have time
for one more share.

05:38.076 --> 05:39.643
I better get
this over with.

05:39.730 --> 05:41.645
Walk of shame...
I'm up four pounds.

05:41.732 --> 05:45.345
- Stay strong.
- We can't all be winners.

05:45.432 --> 05:48.086
Hi. My name is Harry,
and I am an over-eater.

05:48.173 --> 05:49.218
[all]
Hi, harry.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.959
I had a rather tumultuous week

05:51.046 --> 05:55.267
and I'm sad to report...
that I am up four pounds.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.878
- 'That is fine..'
- This is depressing.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.358
You want to get out of here?

05:58.445 --> 06:00.882
It's a support group.
He sat through yours.

06:00.969 --> 06:04.320
But mine was inspiring.
I gave these people a hero.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.323
Valentine's day is a particular
trigger for me.

06:07.410 --> 06:10.587
For, on that fateful day,
I gave my heart

06:10.674 --> 06:12.937
to the love of my life

06:13.024 --> 06:16.767
'only to have her crush it
like an empty slim-fast can.'

06:16.854 --> 06:19.770
Which she could do...
on her forehead, even.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.598
'God, I loved that woman.'

06:21.685 --> 06:25.254
See? He's losing the room.
He can't follow me.

06:25.341 --> 06:26.734
'I showed up
at our romantic dinner'

06:26.821 --> 06:28.953
with a two-pound box
of chocolates

06:29.040 --> 06:31.391
and a three-quarter-carat
engagement ring.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.567
I'm guessing it ended
with she threw the ring at him

06:33.654 --> 06:35.699
and he ate
the two-pound box of candy.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.832
She threw the ring at me

06:37.919 --> 06:40.051
and I ate the two-pound
box of candy.

06:40.138 --> 06:41.401
I called it, right?

06:41.488 --> 06:44.099
Get off your high horse,
this man is hurting.

06:44.186 --> 06:48.277
That was ten years
and 113 pounds ago.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.627
As hard as it is
for me to even think

06:50.714 --> 06:53.717
of putting myself out there..

06:53.804 --> 06:57.373
...somewhere underneath
this protective layer..

06:57.460 --> 07:00.332
...there's still a beating heart

07:00.420 --> 07:02.465
'ready to love again.'

07:04.424 --> 07:06.948
Grab your purse.
Let's beat the traffic.

07:12.127 --> 07:14.172
I'll bet Harry trotted out
that sob story

07:14.259 --> 07:17.001
so everyone would forget about
the guy that lost 40 pounds.

07:17.088 --> 07:18.699
Mike!

07:18.786 --> 07:21.223
Too bad stealing spotlights
doesn't burn calories.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.921
You know, this weight loss
is making you kind of a jerk.

07:24.008 --> 07:26.315
[chuckles]
Right?

07:26.402 --> 07:28.404
You know, my heart
really goes out to Harry.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.319
I-I get that he can be
a little annoying

07:30.406 --> 07:32.060
and kind of a know-it-all..

07:32.147 --> 07:35.411
And his clothes are weird
and his breath is bad.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.240
Sometimes he forgets to wipe
those little crusty things

07:38.327 --> 07:40.895
out from the corner of his eyes.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.984
His nose hairs looks like
there's a family of spiders

07:43.071 --> 07:44.725
living in there.

07:44.812 --> 07:47.467
But nevertheless,
he still deserves love.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.251
I agree. You know,
I told him to try

07:49.338 --> 07:51.209
one of those international
dating sites.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.820
Really? Even with
all the single women

07:52.907 --> 07:54.125
right here in Chicago?

07:54.212 --> 07:55.518
Well, I think
the language barrier

07:55.605 --> 07:57.172
would really play in his favor.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.653
Vietnamese girl,
maybe Cambodian..

07:59.740 --> 08:02.177
Any of your war-ravaged
countries.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.964
I think it's a horrible idea

08:07.051 --> 08:08.618
fixing your sister up
with Harry.

08:08.705 --> 08:11.142
Why not? They're both
available, lovely people.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.753
Yeah, but this
isn't a fairy tale.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.276
The troll doesn't get
the princess.

08:14.363 --> 08:17.105
He stays under the bridge
with his riddles.

08:17.192 --> 08:19.281
Look, if she got to know
the guy I saw tonight

08:19.368 --> 08:20.848
she could look past
all the other..

08:20.935 --> 08:23.633
- Atrocities?
- Quirks. Okay?

08:23.720 --> 08:25.983
He's a very sweet soul,
and so is Victoria.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.769
Victoria is a show pony,
Harry is a three-legged mule

08:28.856 --> 08:30.597
with an ass
covered in flies.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.773
Victoria has dated nothing
but jerks her entire life.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.992
Maybe what she needs right now
is a three-legged mule.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.690
Are we making
three-legged mules?

08:36.777 --> 08:40.128
Because I think we're out of
grapefruit juice and grenadine.

08:40.215 --> 08:43.871
See? There's already kind of
a language barrier built in.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.829
Victoria, you don't want
to go out with Harry, do you?

08:45.916 --> 08:48.266
Mike, that's not how we do it,
you ease into it.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.572
Who's Harry?
Are we done here?

08:49.659 --> 08:51.182
Okay, alright.

08:51.269 --> 08:54.925
He is a really nice guy
that we know from OA.

08:55.012 --> 08:58.668
And he's been over
here several times.

08:58.755 --> 09:01.192
He bought you a karaoke machine
at Christmas.

09:01.279 --> 09:03.455
Oh, the chunky guy
with the sweater vest

09:03.543 --> 09:05.153
and matronly upper arms?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.677
Oh, you noticed his arms.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.680
Well, turns out,
he is currently unattached.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.988
Yeah. Catch him between
disappointments.

09:14.075 --> 09:15.772
I got this.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.948
I know he's not the kind of guy
you usually go out with

09:18.035 --> 09:19.646
but, you know,
I thought it's Valentine's Day

09:19.733 --> 09:21.125
and you're not doing anything.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.779
I am not gonna take
his virginity

09:22.866 --> 09:25.347
'cause I don't do that anymore.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.740
It's like feeding squirrels
at the park.

09:26.827 --> 09:30.221
Once word gets out,
you're surrounded.

09:30.308 --> 09:32.180
I don't blame her...
that guy's been storing his nuts

09:32.267 --> 09:34.356
for 35 winters.

09:34.443 --> 09:36.227
Shush!

09:36.314 --> 09:39.883
I just thought you might enjoy
dinner out with a nice guy.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.104
He is always
very sweet to me.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.714
I know he's a little
rough around the edges

09:44.801 --> 09:46.498
but just look what
I did with Mike.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.718
- What did you do?
- He has come a long way.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.242
Remember when he used to eat
ravioli out of the can?

09:51.329 --> 09:54.158
I remember when he used
to eat ravioli on the can.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.740
Look, if this is some sort of
elaborate prank to see me cry

10:10.827 --> 10:12.916
you could have just played
"wind beneath my wings"

10:13.003 --> 10:16.311
and saved us all
a lot of time.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.486
Look, this is on the up-and-up.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.096
Victoria said yes,
and quite frankly

10:19.183 --> 10:21.229
I'm as surprised as you are.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.231
You know, "surprise"
doesn't even begin to address

10:23.318 --> 10:25.494
what's going on here.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.714
No, this is matrix type stuff.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.673
This is an upside-down
parallel universe.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.240
Speaking of the matrix

10:32.327 --> 10:34.372
should I get one of those
long, black leather dusters?

10:34.459 --> 10:35.896
- It's very slimming.
- No.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.159
Leather's not flattering
on guys like you and me.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.595
No, he's right, if you're
shaped like a football

10:39.682 --> 10:41.597
you shouldn't dress like one.

10:41.684 --> 10:43.338
Gentlemen.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.296
Welcome back
to Andre's Big And Tall.

10:45.383 --> 10:46.341
Are you here
to take advantage of our

10:46.428 --> 10:47.385
saint Valentine's Day blowout?

10:47.472 --> 10:48.996
And what's that, Cousin Andre?

10:49.083 --> 10:51.520
For every suit purchased,
you get two boxes of candy.

10:51.607 --> 10:56.481
One for the lady and one for the
car ride to pick up the lady.

10:56.568 --> 11:00.094
That is so smart. That way,
you don't eat any of hers!

11:00.181 --> 11:03.663
- Man knows his clientele.
- He's a marketing genius.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.968
Actually, Andre,
we're here to give

11:05.055 --> 11:06.970
our lucky lotto winner
a complete makeover.

11:07.057 --> 11:08.363
Nothing too fancy, though.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.712
Just enough to get her
to open the door

11:09.799 --> 11:11.583
after she peeks
through the window.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.282
Just so you know, I'm not afraid
to take a fashion risk.

11:14.369 --> 11:15.718
I had you pegged as a daredevil

11:15.805 --> 11:18.199
the minute you walked
in the door.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.722
Now, I'm thinking
cocktail casual

11:19.809 --> 11:21.506
with just
a splash of color.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.553
I've been told I look
very good in turtlenecks.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.642
I'm afraid your mama
lied to you.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.603
Why don't I grab a couple
of sporty options for you.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.997
Meanwhile, dip a marshmallow
or a piece of sponge cake

11:34.084 --> 11:37.566
into our complimentary
chocolate fountain.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.568
- Ah, ah, ah.
- Stay strong.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.352
You got a date with Victoria
and your goal should be

11:41.439 --> 11:43.311
never having to shop here again.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.052
You are my rock.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.967
This is turning into
an amazing day.

11:47.054 --> 11:51.014
And to think, last week, I was
gonna jump in front of a bus.

11:51.101 --> 11:53.103
Don't build this up
too much in your head, okay?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.236
It's just dinner out
with a nice woman.

11:55.323 --> 11:59.240
"Nice woman?"
No, she's a stone-cold fox.

11:59.327 --> 12:02.373
Just be yourself with Victoria,
and everything will be fine.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.636
Be myself?
I'm a socially awkward fat man

12:04.724 --> 12:06.813
who has a tendency
to talk too much!

12:06.900 --> 12:09.076
So you are aware
of the talking thing?

12:10.468 --> 12:11.861
Yeah, you shouldn't
talk at all.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.254
Women like the strong,
silent type

12:13.341 --> 12:15.560
like Harrison Ford
or Clint Eastwood.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.040
There you go,
just pick a movie star

12:17.127 --> 12:19.129
and try to emulate them.

12:19.216 --> 12:22.742
I certainly love
Olympia Dukakis.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.221
Alright, let's see
if we can't turn

12:24.308 --> 12:26.571
our portly duckling
into a sexy swan.

12:26.658 --> 12:28.573
I chose a breathable fabric
'cause you look like

12:28.660 --> 12:32.229
the kind of a fella
that moistens under pressure.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.318
Are you kidding?
I pitted out as soon as I saw

12:34.405 --> 12:36.103
the chocolate fountain.

12:39.671 --> 12:40.585
[Joyce]
Don't wait up.

12:40.672 --> 12:41.891
Vin and I are going to dinner

12:41.978 --> 12:45.503
and then seeing
Dirty Cirque Du Soleil.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.984
It's basically the same
as regular Cirque Du Soleil

12:48.071 --> 12:51.814
but you see everybody's junk.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.861
Sounds romantic. I hope at least
the clowns are covered up.

12:54.948 --> 12:59.213
Oh, yeah, you can stick
a red nose on anything.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.693
You and Mike are just
staying in tonight?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.435
Yeah, if we can get
the rest of you on your way.

13:04.522 --> 13:06.611
That's her sweet way of
saying, "get the hell out."

13:06.698 --> 13:09.092
To me, she always just says,
"get the hell out."

13:09.179 --> 13:11.878
aw, Vince, get the hell out.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.186
I'm ready.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.797
Is Larry here?

13:17.884 --> 13:19.320
Hey, first of all, it's Harry.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.104
And second of all,
you can't let him see you

13:21.191 --> 13:22.497
dressed like that.

13:22.584 --> 13:24.020
What's wrong with my outfit?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.413
Nothing, but these
are supposed to look like

13:25.500 --> 13:26.762
they're on the inside
trying to get out

13:26.849 --> 13:30.461
not on the outside
trying to get in.

13:30.548 --> 13:32.289
I've tried controlling them,
but they kind of have

13:32.376 --> 13:34.378
a mind of their own.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.771
Well, if you can't
reason with them

13:35.858 --> 13:36.859
then strap them down.

13:36.946 --> 13:37.947
Are you talking about a bra?

13:38.034 --> 13:39.819
At least. Go.

13:41.951 --> 13:45.563
Am I doing a good deed or taping
a hamster to a skyrocket?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.704
Ah, good, we
beat the crowd.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.142
Man, this place
gonna be hopping

13:59.229 --> 14:00.709
in a couple of hours.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.276
A couple of hours?

14:02.363 --> 14:05.409
I should've brought
my comforter and bed linens.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.150
No, man. You don't want
to bring your bedroom here.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.457
You want to bring them
to your bedroom.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.372
Socks, blue jeans,
underpants.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.416
And everything prewashed

14:12.503 --> 14:15.376
so there's no nasty surprises.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.943
A piece of information
you might've shared

14:17.030 --> 14:19.684
with me before we got here.

14:19.771 --> 14:23.036
I'm carrying
a basket full of funk.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.951
No worries, your untidy-whities
are gonna get washed

14:25.038 --> 14:27.127
like, three or four times
before the evening's out.

14:27.214 --> 14:29.259
I might have to borrow
some quarters from you.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.435
[chuckles]
I don't have any quarters.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.524
See, I just got a crisp
$100 bill, so I can walk up

14:33.611 --> 14:34.961
to a lady and say, "Excuse
me, can you break a hundred?

14:35.048 --> 14:37.964
'Cause I don't have
anything smaller."

14:39.791 --> 14:41.924
If you didn't have
anything smaller

14:42.011 --> 14:44.927
why wouldn't you own
your own washer and dryer?

14:47.799 --> 14:49.410
Hey, you gonna ask a lot of
questions or you want to listen

14:49.497 --> 14:50.890
and learn something?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.848
I'm sorry.
I'm just nervous.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.545
Now, just remember, they
call it "getting lucky"

14:54.632 --> 14:56.721
but luck is the residue
of design.

14:56.808 --> 14:59.550
That's why I brought
a bottle of woolite

14:59.637 --> 15:03.119
so I can offer a little cap
full for their delicates.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.425
Thus bringing up the topic

15:04.512 --> 15:06.253
of their panties
and undergarments

15:06.340 --> 15:09.996
without mentioning
their unmentionables.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.823
This is not my first time
at the laundromat.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.825
Hey-ey-ey, don't load
the dryer next to mine.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.392
Why not?

15:15.479 --> 15:19.092
Questioning me again.
We've got to spread out.

15:19.179 --> 15:22.095
Otherwise, they're gonna
think we're a gay couple.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.619
Got it.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.229
But if we were a gay couple

15:26.316 --> 15:29.798
we would not be spending
Valentine's Day in a laundromat.

15:29.885 --> 15:31.365
- What?
- I'm just saying..

15:31.452 --> 15:33.628
I'd insist you take me
someplace nice.

15:44.421 --> 15:45.770
[sighs]
You know what?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.250
I don't think he's coming.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.860
Oh, it's probably just traffic

15:48.948 --> 15:51.472
it being, you know,
Valentine's Day and all.

15:51.559 --> 15:55.258
Yeah. Could be anything. Maybe
he stepped in front of a bus.

15:55.345 --> 15:57.869
Or maybe the line
at the florist is long.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.872
I'm-I'm sure he's not standing
you up, right, Mike?

16:00.960 --> 16:01.961
No way.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.353
Well, I'm not just gonna

16:03.440 --> 16:04.833
sit around here
wasting my time.

16:04.920 --> 16:08.054
I'll be upstairs
smoking a bowl.

16:08.141 --> 16:09.794
Don't get too comfortable.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.796
Any minute,
that-that sweet fella

16:11.883 --> 16:13.973
is gonna be at our front door.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.018
[whispers]
Where is that idiot?

16:16.105 --> 16:17.367
I didn't want to set Harry up

16:17.454 --> 16:18.716
with your sister
in the first place.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.109
Don't split hairs.
Just call him.

16:20.196 --> 16:21.458
I'm not getting
in the middle of this.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.243
Hey, it's Valentine's Day.

16:23.330 --> 16:24.766
Do you want to get
lucky tonight or not?

16:24.853 --> 16:28.030
You're ovulating now,
you got no choice.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.250
Damn it. Just call him!

16:31.120 --> 16:32.948
Fine.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.171
[cell phone ringing in distance]

16:43.698 --> 16:46.048
[ringing continues]

16:49.225 --> 16:50.487
Don't be mad at me.

16:50.574 --> 16:52.446
And if you hit me,
don't hit me in the face

16:52.533 --> 16:56.189
'cause I'm getting
a new Costco Card on Monday.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.494
What are you doing
out here, Harry?

16:57.581 --> 16:59.627
Victoria's been waiting
for you all night.

16:59.714 --> 17:02.064
I can't do this, Mike.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.023
I'm standing on a crescent moon
reaching for a star

17:04.110 --> 17:06.068
and it's too far to fall.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.288
'Kay, save the poetry
for the lady.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.550
And why are you
getting so nervous?

17:09.637 --> 17:10.855
It's just dinner.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.727
Dinner with an angel.

17:12.814 --> 17:14.163
And I'm just a troll

17:14.250 --> 17:17.253
with an inordinate amount
of ear hair.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.299
Don't talk about my friend
Harry that way.

17:19.386 --> 17:20.604
You're a great guy.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.172
You're kind
and you're sensitive..

17:23.259 --> 17:26.610
...and one other thing.

17:26.697 --> 17:30.614
But what if I blow it and ruin
my last chance at love?

17:30.701 --> 17:33.313
Well, pal, I can't guarantee

17:33.400 --> 17:36.142
that you and Victoria
are gonna be a couple.

17:36.229 --> 17:38.100
But I do know you're
both good people

17:38.187 --> 17:40.668
who deserve to be happy.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.365
It's so easy for you.

17:42.452 --> 17:43.845
What are you talking about?

17:43.932 --> 17:45.325
You didn't know me
before I met Molly.

17:45.412 --> 17:47.196
- I was a mess.
- Impossible.

17:47.283 --> 17:49.546
It's true,
I'd hide out in my apartment

17:49.633 --> 17:53.507
with my two best friends,
Ho Ho and Ding Dong.

17:53.594 --> 17:56.379
Are they really spending
tonight at the laundromat?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.252
Yes, they are.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.080
But you're not.

18:01.167 --> 18:04.561
You're here,
you're looking good

18:04.648 --> 18:07.086
and you got a sweet
woman waiting for you.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.870
You really think
I can do this?

18:08.957 --> 18:10.611
Hey, before I went
out with Molly

18:10.698 --> 18:12.787
I had the same doubts as you.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.094
It's scary to put
yourself out there.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.705
But I did,
and look at us now.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.100
Completely and totally in love.

18:23.406 --> 18:26.453
Where the hell
have you been?

18:26.540 --> 18:29.238
- Harry's here.
- Oh, hi!

18:29.325 --> 18:30.457
Come on in.
Victoria!

18:30.544 --> 18:32.633
He's here!

18:32.720 --> 18:35.244
Aw, don't you look great. Oh,
she's gonna love the flowers.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.420
Actually, these are for you.

18:37.507 --> 18:41.250
Thank you for making a dream
come true.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.428
There it is.
There's that sweet side.

18:45.515 --> 18:48.257
Just...just show her that

18:48.344 --> 18:49.867
and she won't even
notice that hair.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.565
[blowing]

18:54.524 --> 18:57.092
Hey, Harry.

18:57.179 --> 19:00.400
You look very handsome.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.793
Just breathe
and don't lock your knees.

19:02.880 --> 19:05.492
Olympia Dukakis,
Olympia Dukakis..

19:21.725 --> 19:24.554
Probably this location.

19:24.641 --> 19:25.947
[sighs]

19:26.034 --> 19:27.557
I bet the laundromat
near the bus station

19:27.644 --> 19:29.342
is crawling with
lonely, dejected tail

19:29.429 --> 19:31.866
looking to get out of town.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.041
Plus, if they can't
afford to fly

19:33.128 --> 19:36.305
they ain't gonna
be too picky.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.177
Carl, can we please
just go home

19:38.264 --> 19:39.569
while we have
a little bit of dignity

19:39.656 --> 19:42.746
and some of our clothes
still fit us?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.531
Hey, don't be a quitter.

19:44.618 --> 19:47.273
This is the time of night
when Valentine's dates go bad.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.536
Soon, the streets are gonna
be filled with crying women

19:49.623 --> 19:52.539
walking home carrying
their high heels.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.367
So, you're suggesting
we drive around

19:54.454 --> 19:56.238
offering sobbing women
a ride home?

19:56.325 --> 19:59.067
Well, not from inside
the car. That's creepy.

20:00.460 --> 20:02.201
No, y-you park
around the corner

20:02.288 --> 20:03.854
get out and just happen to be
walking in the opposite

20:03.941 --> 20:06.379
direction when they pass by.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.816
"Excuse me, miss.
Is everything okay?

20:08.903 --> 20:11.210
"Aw.

20:12.254 --> 20:14.387
"There, there.

20:15.779 --> 20:18.608
"Everything's just
gonna be fine.

20:18.695 --> 20:22.482
Carl's here."

20:22.569 --> 20:24.614
I've said it once,
I'll say it again

20:24.701 --> 20:27.617
you, sir,
are a perverted genius.

20:27.704 --> 20:28.792
[dryer buzzes]

20:28.879 --> 20:31.273
Oh! My thong
underwear's dry.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.368
[theme music]
