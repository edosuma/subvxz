WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:06.787
(Rick breathing heavily)

00:34.660 --> 00:36.651
(footsteps approach)

00:37.996 --> 00:39.862
(lock clicks)

00:39.957 --> 00:41.698
(door opens)

01:01.895 --> 01:03.932
Rick: It's not too late for you.

01:04.855 --> 01:07.223
My offer still stands.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.101
You can join us...

01:10.195 --> 01:12.607
or you can die.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.131
Turn.

01:51.820 --> 01:54.357
(flash bulb pops)

01:59.453 --> 02:00.693
(doors creaking)

02:07.628 --> 02:08.913
Why?

02:09.003 --> 02:10.836
Why the pictures?

02:10.922 --> 02:13.289
Sculpt you, after.

02:14.926 --> 02:17.042
After what?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.423
After.

02:20.015 --> 02:21.676
(theme music playing)

03:01.056 --> 03:03.047
(walkers growling in distance)

03:43.473 --> 03:45.384
(knock on door)

03:45.475 --> 03:47.136
(door opens)

03:53.734 --> 03:55.725
(walkers growling in distance)

03:57.612 --> 03:59.899
I'm well-aware you're the fifth columner.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.815
Green duffel, red paint, workers' guns.

04:04.619 --> 04:06.826
Doesn't require Turing-grade decryption

04:06.913 --> 04:09.029
to grok the truth that you're the traitor

04:09.124 --> 04:10.910
creeping and colluding with AHK.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.910
It's an acronym I've concocted--
Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.416
I considered going with KAH,

04:16.505 --> 04:18.964
but it remains
a hair too onomatopoeiac.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.841
I've been charged
by no less than Negan himself

04:21.928 --> 04:23.635
with cracking the very calamity

04:23.722 --> 04:26.305
you more than likely
had a heavy hand in creating.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.311
So I need you to cease and desist

04:32.397 --> 04:34.855
all betrayals and backstabbery,

04:34.941 --> 04:37.182
fronting and Judas-ness A.S.A.P.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.067
In exchange,
I offer to keep what I know

04:42.157 --> 04:44.899
from Negan and the others.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.207
(gasps)

05:03.428 --> 05:06.011
The Saviors are finished.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.181
Megan's finished.

05:11.603 --> 05:14.095
And this place...

05:14.189 --> 05:16.100
what it's been...

05:16.191 --> 05:17.932
that's all over.

05:19.778 --> 05:23.271
Food and water's runnin' low,
workers are angry,

05:23.365 --> 05:25.902
the Saviors, they're gettin' scared.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.905
And this place is gonna fall,

05:28.995 --> 05:31.908
and all you have to do
to be on the winning side

05:31.998 --> 05:33.363
is to stand down.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.701
All you have to do is nothing.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.206
Wait.

05:38.964 --> 05:41.296
Let it play out.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.750
Can you do that?

05:47.806 --> 05:50.468
You've seen what happens here...

05:53.311 --> 05:55.302
heard the screams...

05:56.982 --> 05:59.519
smelled the burning skin.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.729
You don't got blood on your hands yet,

06:04.823 --> 06:07.611
<i>but that's comm'.</i>

06:07.701 --> 06:11.319
Once you do those things,
you become those things,

06:11.413 --> 06:13.199
and there's no goin' back.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.623
No forgettin' it.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.752
What cranks my shaft is bein' safe.

06:22.591 --> 06:25.253
And here, me bein' safe

06:25.343 --> 06:27.960
means a whole lot
of other people are safe.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.136
I think about that a great deal.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.642
(chair creaks)

06:41.067 --> 06:43.809
Yes, I'm Negan...

06:45.739 --> 06:48.071
and it ain't perfect,

06:48.158 --> 06:50.240
but we are Saviors.

06:52.662 --> 06:54.244
We save.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.795
Like I said...

07:05.467 --> 07:07.378
your cloak-and-dagger's on the Q.T.

07:10.513 --> 07:13.005
All I ask is that you do nothin'
that results in harm

07:13.099 --> 07:16.217
to anyone inside these walls,
and it'll stay that way.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.726
(muffled walkers growling)

07:51.096 --> 07:53.383
What do you think?

07:54.516 --> 07:56.257
A day.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.718
Maybe two.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.803
(growling continues)

08:06.778 --> 08:08.769
(walkers growling in distance)

08:12.534 --> 08:14.116
Dr. Carson: Eugene.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.365
I could use a little help.
Can you come in?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.036
He's getting worse.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.371
It's an infection.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.502
Maybe more than one.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.875
It's attacking his organs.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.052
It's only a matter of time
until one fails.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.096
- Just wish we had some damn meds.
- Mm.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.923
I wish he hadn't assisted

08:38.018 --> 08:40.885
in the ill-conceived caper
to trap us in here.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.686
I also wish for Razzles,

08:42.772 --> 08:45.730
but if wishes were horses and all that...

08:45.817 --> 08:48.684
- What, you think this is his fault?
- It is.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.486
Not the whole of it,
but he was a member of the campaign.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.898
I do get it...

08:54.993 --> 08:57.280
but I shan't forget it.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.986
Would you sit with him?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.286
How's that?

09:00.373 --> 09:01.909
I'm gonna head to the marketplace,

09:02.000 --> 09:03.707
see if they have any herbs down there,

09:03.793 --> 09:05.909
try some Eastern medicine on him.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.836
He shouldn't be alone.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.914
- And he's your friend.
- Traveling companion.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.750
Okay. Do you want him to die?

09:12.844 --> 09:15.131
No.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.383
I'll be back soon.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.426
(door closes)

09:22.520 --> 09:24.511
(walkers growling in distance)

09:29.235 --> 09:31.101
(coughing)

09:38.119 --> 09:39.484
(groans)

09:39.579 --> 09:41.161
Sit.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.457
You look worse than me.

09:45.543 --> 09:46.749
Mm.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.497
I don't appreciate that,

09:48.588 --> 09:51.626
because you look like
a potato and shit casserole.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.505
Sit.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.747
(coughing)

10:39.097 --> 10:42.010
Are you gonna help me
get Dr. Carson out of here?

10:43.268 --> 10:45.600
Given that this building
is currently surrounded

10:45.687 --> 10:48.019
by a Wilkes-Barre of walkers,

10:48.106 --> 10:51.019
I don't see an escape attempt
without putting to use

10:51.109 --> 10:52.816
the same flawed technique of innards

10:52.902 --> 10:55.439
which landed you
in your status-quo piss-poor condition.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.859
What you may have forgotten
in your request

10:58.950 --> 11:01.612
is that I am a small person
who does not stick his neck out

11:01.703 --> 11:03.660
for anyone other than himself.

11:03.746 --> 11:05.612
I stick firmly within my lane

11:05.707 --> 11:09.075
without any need for a signal,
hand or automatic.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.458
All I want is for you
to do the right thing.

11:13.548 --> 11:16.461
And what is said definition on that?

11:16.551 --> 11:18.883
Can't say I ever sussed it out.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.257
Right for some can be
downright horrific for others,

11:21.347 --> 11:24.590
and knowing that has kept me vertical
when so many have gone horizontal.

11:26.144 --> 11:30.388
It requires faith, trusting yourself.

11:32.859 --> 11:37.069
Believing that God
is inside of you...

11:37.155 --> 11:39.522
guiding you...

11:39.616 --> 11:42.984
and knowing that he has a plan
for all of us.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.318
Is that so hard?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.871
It's absurd.

11:47.957 --> 11:49.493
Is it?

11:49.584 --> 11:53.452
You're a man of science...

11:53.546 --> 11:58.086
who not too long ago would've found it

11:58.176 --> 12:01.840
impossible to believe
that the dead could walk.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.300
So maybe...

12:08.519 --> 12:11.011
maybe it's not impossible to believe

12:11.105 --> 12:14.564
that you will know
what the right thing is

12:14.651 --> 12:16.517
when the time comes.

12:17.528 --> 12:20.111
And then...

12:20.198 --> 12:25.113
you will-- you'll act.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.062
Man on radio: Got something.

12:55.149 --> 12:57.937
<i>Looked like a truck,
but I lost visual from the water tower.</i>

13:06.077 --> 13:07.567
(bird squawking)

13:18.047 --> 13:20.459
It's one of ours.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.757
(knock on door)

13:25.930 --> 13:27.170
Tanya,heHo.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.848
You said a week.
It's been a week.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.846
Our deal? My boombox?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.682
- Well, yes, I mean--
- Did you fix it?

13:40.695 --> 13:42.026
A-Are you serious?

13:42.113 --> 13:43.399
Yeah.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.355
Well, it's not ready.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.906
Our neck is
in the noose of the deceased,

13:46.993 --> 13:48.404
and it is tightening
with every ticktock.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.283
Are you not distressed
that we're trapped?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.284
I was already trapped here.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.077
You've got until tomorrow, Eugene,
and then we renegotiate.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.083
Wait.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.792
Would it be possible to take possession
of the second bottle

14:05.887 --> 14:08.800
despite the delivery delinquency?

14:08.890 --> 14:11.382
The deal was one bottle up front

14:11.476 --> 14:13.968
and one bottle after you fix it.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.099
I need it.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.609
You making it into jet fuel or something?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.813
I've taken to throwing 1.5 fluid ounces
down my gullet most P.M.s

14:25.907 --> 14:27.443
as a necessary requirement

14:27.533 --> 14:30.116
to catching
some increasingly elusive 2's.

14:32.747 --> 14:35.114
Ergo, I need the giggle juice.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.469
I get it.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.013
I need help sleeping, too.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.682
I don't get it.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.759
Yes, you do.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.639
You help them, Eugene.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.562
You help him.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.767
I tried to stop this.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.602
Me and Frankie,
we came to you,

15:05.696 --> 15:08.358
and we asked you for your help.

15:08.449 --> 15:12.067
You could've changed this place
into something else,

15:12.161 --> 15:13.822
something better.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.779
But you took care of you,

15:15.873 --> 15:18.285
and now you've got to live with that.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.869
I hope this helps.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.376
- But it won't.
- (door opens)

15:28.970 --> 15:30.711
Negan wants you.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.100
Tara: Our people are gonna be
at the Sanctuary soon,

15:38.187 --> 15:40.519
asking for their surrender.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.893
We're almost there.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.645
That's why we do it.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.351
We make it happen.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.404
So we cover you with crossfire
from the upper windows,

15:49.490 --> 15:51.902
you crash the truck into the walkers

15:51.993 --> 15:53.483
and through to the building.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.660
Yep, crack it open, Savior buffet.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.330
Rosita: You know the workers
will make it away, up the stairs?

15:59.417 --> 16:01.033
They're on the other side of the building.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.368
- They should make it.
- You sure?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.750
After we do this,
their only choice is to give up.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.832
It's risky.
They could see the truck comin'.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.543
There weren't any more weapons
at the Saviors' warehouse, right?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.423
No more rockets for the RPGs.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.130
We work with what we got.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.340
You got me.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.685
Other snipers, too.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.722
<i>Saviors see you comm',
we got you covered,</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:25.022
whatever it takes.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.567
I want it done.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.564
I want them done.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.771
Daryl: Good.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.573
So, we doin' this or what?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.777
W-Why don't we just wait it out
like we planned?

16:36.871 --> 16:38.782
(scoffs)
Michonne's right.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.784
What you're talking about is risky.
Things could go bad.

16:40.875 --> 16:44.539
The truck with the speakers
almost took all those walkers away.

16:44.629 --> 16:46.791
It almost did go bad.
Something else could.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.873
Even if it don't, we don't got
the Kingdom fighters no more.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.378
I mean, if the Saviors
want to put up a fight,

16:51.469 --> 16:53.426
we don't got the numbers
to make 'em surrender.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.424
That's why Rick's talking
to the Scavengers.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.597
Tara: You got shot. They lied to us.

16:57.683 --> 17:00.550
- You-- You believe 'em now?
- I believe in Rick Grimes.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.727
I could've done something...

17:02.813 --> 17:04.520
sooner, to end this.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.395
I knew about those weapons at Oceanside,

17:07.484 --> 17:09.601
and I waited.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.857
I didn't do shit about it.

17:11.948 --> 17:15.236
With or without you,
I'm not letting that happen again.

17:15.326 --> 17:17.693
Then it's without me.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.240
I'm out.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.704
We got some cars parked
near the east-side lookout.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.586
You can take one and go home.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.667
(insects chirping)

17:35.721 --> 17:36.927
You staying?

17:37.014 --> 17:39.346
You good with all this?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.095
I helped get this started.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.769
Got to see it through.

17:44.855 --> 17:48.018
You think it's easier
to come out here and risk

17:48.109 --> 17:50.476
than to stay back there and wait.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.733
And I get it--
I used to believe that, too.

17:53.823 --> 17:56.815
Thing is sometimes,
you just have to wait.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.276
Sometimes you don't get to know.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.952
I just wish it didn't take

18:01.038 --> 18:03.450
seeing Sasha walk out
of that coffin to realize it.

18:08.129 --> 18:09.665
Daryl: Come on.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.245
Let's go.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.331
(truck door opens)

18:36.365 --> 18:38.902
If things don't get fixed soon,

18:38.993 --> 18:41.485
a lot of people are gonna die.

18:41.579 --> 18:43.695
My People.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.121
Not me, of course.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.291
I'm livin' no matter what.
lam too good at this shit.

18:49.378 --> 18:53.588
But others... I can't have that.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.507
I don't want to see people
get shot up, chewed up,

18:56.594 --> 18:58.084
and chewing up the rest.

18:58.179 --> 19:01.171
I don't want to see you
get eaten, Eugene.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.762
This place, it's about pooling

19:08.856 --> 19:11.894
and organizing strength.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.815
And you...

19:16.906 --> 19:19.898
my friend, are strong.

19:21.202 --> 19:26.538
That spongy organ between your eyes
and your spectacular mullet

19:26.624 --> 19:28.285
is strong,

19:28.376 --> 19:31.744
and I just want to make sure
that you know...

19:31.837 --> 19:34.795
that I know that.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.340
Consider me made.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.839
Our pages are utterly
and completely one and the same.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.363
Eugene...

20:00.449 --> 20:03.032
I was going for a handshake.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.240
Stand up.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.162
Now, I can see
where you'd be confused,

20:16.257 --> 20:18.464
as I rarely do that shit.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.794
A handshake is a sign of mutual respect.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.551
Not many people get that from me.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.848
There's work that needs getting to.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.399
(Sasha growling)

22:00.486 --> 22:02.443
(breathes shakily)

22:10.788 --> 22:12.779
(exhales deeply)

22:23.968 --> 22:25.959
(walkers growling in distance)

22:40.568 --> 22:43.060
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Hey, cut that engine.

22:43.153 --> 22:45.815
Any closer,
you'll draw walkers from the yard.

22:47.408 --> 22:50.150
(brakes squeal, engine shuts off)

22:58.794 --> 23:00.410
Here.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.757
You take fire from the windows,
we fire back.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.338
Come on.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.849
There's a spot for cover by the chutes.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.064
You up for this?

23:28.866 --> 23:32.279
I came here 'cause I wanted
to see things for myself.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.370
I wanted to know
that things were gonna work.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.245
But you know what?

23:41.670 --> 23:44.002
I don't get to know that.

23:44.089 --> 23:46.581
None of us do.

23:46.675 --> 23:49.713
What I do know
is that things are working now.

23:51.305 --> 23:53.012
So maybe...

23:53.098 --> 23:55.305
we just need to trust

23:55.392 --> 23:57.008
that things are gonna keep working,

23:57.102 --> 23:59.810
because this...

23:59.897 --> 24:02.013
what we're about to do...

24:03.901 --> 24:06.984
it's not worth risking us.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.654
It is for me.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.026
Just is.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.747
I hope it works.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.044
L-I really, really do,

24:26.131 --> 24:28.042
but I-l can't do it.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.418
I just can't.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.761
Then you shouldn't.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.078
(truck door closes)

25:14.471 --> 25:17.088
We got Morgan and the snipers.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.468
We can do this.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.884
Yeah.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.890
We will.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.737
(walkers growling)

25:38.954 --> 25:41.070
<i>Eugene:
Audio recording for transcription.</i>

25:41.165 --> 25:43.156
<i>Emergency operations manual, first entry.</i>

25:43.250 --> 25:47.494
<i>Countermeasure approach
for fence incursion.</i>

25:47.588 --> 25:51.331
High pop of undead, good 40,
50 deep to the former fence.

25:53.844 --> 25:57.633
Note to accompany schematics
for audio glider emergency binder.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.514
Audio glider activated for sound,

26:00.601 --> 26:03.343
utilizing music as 96 decibel redirection,

26:03.437 --> 26:07.351
drawing active deceased along with it
away from all exits,

26:07.441 --> 26:11.526
allowing immediate free passage
for permanent redirection,

26:11.612 --> 26:12.943
if successful.

26:14.615 --> 26:17.949
Scratch the if--
when-- when successful.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.400
Hell, yes.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.740
Dwight: Don't turn around.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.956
(walkers growling in distance)

26:44.478 --> 26:45.968
(walkie-talkie clicks)

26:46.063 --> 26:47.553
(whispers) I'm here.

26:47.648 --> 26:50.140
I'm ready.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.145
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- South lookout--

26:52.236 --> 26:54.978
ready for go.

26:55.072 --> 26:56.983
<i>Man on radio: East lookout, ready.</i>

26:58.867 --> 27:01.199
<i>Woman on radio: North lookout, ready.</i>

27:01.286 --> 27:04.574
<i>Man on radio #2: West lookout, ready.</i>

27:04.665 --> 27:06.576
(brakes squeal)

27:09.336 --> 27:13.125
Dwight:
Get up, back away from that thing.

27:17.261 --> 27:19.628
Back away from it!

27:29.523 --> 27:32.015
I'm attempting to save people, Dwight.

27:34.111 --> 27:36.648
And killin' me is killin'
a great many innocents.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.235
When this bird slips its surly bounds,

27:41.326 --> 27:43.613
it's gonna Pied Piper away
their cold corpses

27:43.704 --> 27:45.445
and free this place.

27:45.539 --> 27:49.248
And Negan will kill Rick
and Daryl and Rosita

27:49.334 --> 27:51.120
and all your old friends.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.124
They're former traveling companions,
nothing more.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.923
I'm working with them

27:58.010 --> 28:01.423
to keep them and the people here alive.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.255
We can get rid of Negan.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.590
Just Negan.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.052
And we're almost there.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.938
Negan ain't the dyin' type, Dwight.

28:13.025 --> 28:14.481
Oh, but you are, Eugene.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.605
(voice breaking)
I am.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.528
That's exactly why I've not yet
stepped back, as it were.

28:22.159 --> 28:25.493
By my reckoning,
I have two selects on facin' my fate.

28:26.330 --> 28:28.492
One, I abort launch on this glider,

28:28.582 --> 28:31.620
don't free this place from
the stranglehold of cold teeth/tongues,

28:31.710 --> 28:33.292
and Negan will likely execute me

28:33.378 --> 28:35.961
as what he considers to be
a personal favor.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.460
Or I could go for
what's behind door number two,

28:38.550 --> 28:40.086
take my chances being shot in the back

28:40.177 --> 28:42.088
by a sometime-ally, despite any injury

28:42.179 --> 28:43.886
I may have caused in the past

28:43.972 --> 28:46.384
by delivering a chomp down
on your chode.

28:57.361 --> 28:59.352
(upbeat music plays loudly)

28:59.446 --> 29:01.153
(motor whirring)

29:03.700 --> 29:05.691
(walkers growling)

29:16.546 --> 29:17.786
NQW!

29:17.881 --> 29:20.714
(engine revving)

29:23.387 --> 29:26.129
(music continues)

29:29.977 --> 29:31.513
(music stops)

29:31.603 --> 29:33.594
(walkers growling)

29:43.198 --> 29:44.905
(gunshots)

30:00.757 --> 30:02.623
(gunshots)

30:23.780 --> 30:25.691
Daryl, you're clear to the south.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.023
<i>You and Tara should head home.</i>

30:48.055 --> 30:50.968
(people screaming)

30:51.058 --> 30:53.641
Let's go! Move it! Let's go!

30:55.729 --> 30:58.471
Fall back! Move!

30:58.565 --> 31:00.306
Move!

31:02.444 --> 31:05.277
Fall back! Move! Move!

31:05.364 --> 31:08.072
(screaming continues)

31:29.846 --> 31:31.837
(man screaming)

31:50.992 --> 31:52.983
Move! Move!

32:11.346 --> 32:12.632
The answer is no!

32:12.722 --> 32:15.054
I will never, not on your Nelly,
be on board with your plan.

32:15.142 --> 32:17.224
Your invite is declined.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.802
I will not end up like Sasha or you.

32:19.896 --> 32:20.886
You both made your choices,

32:20.981 --> 32:23.518
what I imagine most will
calculate as the right thing,

32:23.608 --> 32:25.269
rolled your D20s and came up dead

32:25.360 --> 32:26.646
and seemingly soon to be.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.318
I cannot do the same.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.737
Now, judge me if you choose,
but I'm seeing 20 for 20,

32:30.824 --> 32:32.906
I'm feeling ten for ten,
I'm receiving five by five

32:32.993 --> 32:34.700
that staying safe means staying alive,

32:34.786 --> 32:37.904
and I'm A-okay with doing
whatever it takes to lock that down.

32:37.998 --> 32:39.659
So I will obey Negan.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.786
I will not cover for anyone's U-turn
on loyalties,

32:41.877 --> 32:44.414
and I will damn well make sure that
Dr. Carson stays cozy,

32:44.504 --> 32:48.919
comfy right here in case
I ever require his healing expertise!

32:49.009 --> 32:51.922
And I won't feel bad about it.

32:52.012 --> 32:54.174
Because I will survive.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.676
It's in my biological imperative.

32:57.642 --> 32:59.758
It's all I know how to do.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.769
(door slams)

33:06.776 --> 33:09.518
Negan: It'll take an ass-load of ammo.

33:09.613 --> 33:11.729
It will.

33:12.824 --> 33:16.067
Even with shot discipline
and P and Q minding.

33:16.161 --> 33:20.655
Can my bullet maker
fill my guns back up?

33:24.044 --> 33:27.002
If you give my machines to me
or me to my machines...

33:28.757 --> 33:30.668
that is an affirmative.

33:34.679 --> 33:38.798
You do realize the storm of shit
I'm gonna dump on Rick

33:38.892 --> 33:43.432
as soon as I am clear of
the shit storm he dumped on me.

33:44.314 --> 33:45.600
I do, indeed.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.724
Goddamn, Eugene.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.400
How does it feel

33:50.487 --> 33:52.194
to be the second-most
important person here?

33:52.280 --> 33:54.362
How does it feel

33:54.449 --> 33:56.861
to save these good people?

33:58.078 --> 33:59.989
It feels great.

34:00.997 --> 34:03.455
Got something else of urgency for you.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.283
Another item solved.

34:05.377 --> 34:09.335
More than a way out
and a promise of bullets on the way?

34:10.507 --> 34:16.002
Jesus, Eugene, you are magnificent.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.757
I am.

34:21.434 --> 34:23.050
So, what is it?

34:23.143 --> 34:24.760
Tell me.

34:25.855 --> 34:28.141
(knock on door)

34:28.233 --> 34:29.438
- What?
- (door opens)

34:30.485 --> 34:31.850
We have the stairs.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.186
But the dead ones have the lower level--

34:34.281 --> 34:35.442
the whole thing.

34:35.532 --> 34:37.022
Not much longer.

34:37.117 --> 34:40.326
See, Eugene has solved us
a way out of this mess.

34:40.411 --> 34:45.121
And... he actually says he has a topper.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.449
Yeah?

34:55.135 --> 34:56.967
I think I could fix the intercom system.

34:58.221 --> 35:00.303
Which, uh...

35:00.390 --> 35:03.803
would absolutely change the face
of communications here.

35:05.020 --> 35:07.352
That's it?

35:07.439 --> 35:08.679
Sorry.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.105
That kind of thing, uh...

35:11.192 --> 35:13.274
well, cranks my shaft.

35:15.905 --> 35:18.146
I'll leave you to the last action item.

35:20.577 --> 35:22.568
(machine-gun fire in distance)

36:03.286 --> 36:05.277
(machine-gun fire continues)

37:35.545 --> 37:38.378
(walker growling)

37:46.055 --> 37:48.046
Time for after.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.991
Jadis: Subdue!

38:47.116 --> 38:49.198
I'm walking out now,

38:49.285 --> 38:51.447
and me walking out means all of you die.

38:52.705 --> 38:55.538
My people-- there's a lot of them--

38:55.625 --> 38:59.289
won't attack today, but we will attack.

39:02.715 --> 39:04.205
(walker growling)

39:04.300 --> 39:07.884
You can play your games,
draw your pictures,

39:07.971 --> 39:10.759
sculpt whatever shit you want,

39:10.849 --> 39:12.681
but I am leaving!

39:14.811 --> 39:17.473
After that...

39:17.564 --> 39:20.898
maybe you should just run.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.285
We done?

39:43.089 --> 39:44.921
Yes.

39:58.438 --> 40:00.930
Join you.

40:01.024 --> 40:02.560
What then?

40:04.360 --> 40:06.943
The Sanctuary is surrounded.

40:07.030 --> 40:08.191
Walkers.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.522
20 deep around the compound.

40:10.617 --> 40:12.574
You'll come with me there...

40:13.536 --> 40:15.152
we'll wait till the others meet us.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.455
When they do,
we'll ask the lieutenants to surrender.

40:18.541 --> 40:21.329
All of us, together.

40:22.670 --> 40:26.083
Then I kill Negan, me alone.

40:30.303 --> 40:32.044
We have a deal?

40:33.181 --> 40:37.300
After, Saviors' things our things.

40:37.393 --> 40:40.306
If yes, then yes.

40:40.396 --> 40:43.229
It'll be all of ours. You'll get a fourth.

40:43.316 --> 40:46.183
- Half.
- A fourth.

40:47.779 --> 40:50.487
Fourth, and I sculpt you after.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.190
Stand for me, those off.

40:54.577 --> 40:57.239
These off, no sculpting.

40:58.414 --> 41:02.157
My boots and my clothes now.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.036
Fourth.

41:07.173 --> 41:08.914
Fourth.

41:27.193 --> 41:29.434
(brakes squeal)

41:31.030 --> 41:33.021
