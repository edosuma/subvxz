century, they vowed to cure the planet</i>

01:05.182 --> 01:07.251

01:07.385 --> 01:10.187
<i>While they made
their bold promises in public,</i>

01:10.321 --> 01:12.622
<i>in secret,
they planned their escape.</i>

01:12.756 --> 01:15.126
<i>And so today,
after years of unrest,</i>

01:15.259 --> 01:17.727
<i>society has reached
its breaking point</i>

01:17.861 --> 01:19.896
<i>as the last shuttle
departs for New Earth,</i>

01:20.031 --> 01:23.467
<i>damning 19 billion people
to extinction.</i>

02:07.777 --> 02:09.180
We stick to the plan.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.797

Positive. Take him in.

02:45.682 --> 02:47.985
- <i>Have your papers ready.</i>
- Move. Move.

02:48.119 --> 02:50.787
<i>Stowaways will be

- Hey! Hey!

02:55.859 --> 02:57.394

03:04.235 --> 03:05.635
- She's plague-free.
- Get in.

03:05.768 --> 03:07.438
No! I'm not leaving
without him!

03:07.571 --> 03:09.306
No! No!

03:09.440 --> 03:11.841
Hold them!
Don't let them through!

03:11.976 --> 03:13.810
Stop them!

All passengers
report to Cryo immediately!

03:47.710 --> 03:49.313
How do I get off the ship?

03:49.446 --> 03:52.815
Sir, we have stowaways
trying to breach the vents.

03:52.949 --> 03:54.817
Just report to Cryo.

04:01.559 --> 04:03.060
Come here.

04:03.194 --> 04:04.228
Ahh.

04:05.695 --> 04:07.665
Where's your mama?

04:08.999 --> 04:10.968
We'll find your mama, okay?

04:16.005 --> 04:17.440
<i>Welcome.</i>

04:17.575 --> 04:19.577
<i>You are the last
1,000 passengers to board.</i>

<i>The other passengers
are already in Cryo.</i>

04:23.414 --> 04:26.783
<i>Please proceed to main hall
before reporting to Cryo.</i>

04:36.893 --> 04:39.430
I am Admiral Kiernan Adams.

04:39.563 --> 04:44.101
Welcome to my home,
the <i>U.S.S. Hercules.</i>

04:44.235 --> 04:48.372
The <i>Herc</i> is the last
quant-engine-enabled ship

04:48.505 --> 04:51.175
capable of making
the journey to New Earth.

04:51.308 --> 04:53.277
As to the 41 other shuttles

04:53.410 --> 04:55.145
that have gone ahead
to New Earth,

04:55.279 --> 04:59.450
well, I hope it's the paradise
they said it would be.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.118
For the next six months,

05:01.252 --> 05:03.954
we will blaze
across space and time.

05:04.088 --> 05:05.755
For most of us in Cryo,

05:05.888 --> 05:07.958
this journey
will be but a dream.

05:08.092 --> 05:12.730
For our children, it will be
the journey that gave them life.

05:12.862 --> 05:14.465
The worst is behind us.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.501
All hands to their stations.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.803
Hayley!

05:21.605 --> 05:23.374
- Hayley.
- Noah?

05:26.277 --> 05:28.012
Ohh.

05:29.313 --> 05:31.015
- You okay? You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

05:31.148 --> 05:33.450
- We're fine. The baby's fine.
- Yeah.

05:38.022 --> 05:39.323
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:42.892 --> 05:44.662
- I thought I lost you.
- Me, too.

05:44.794 --> 05:46.929
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
You gotta go.

05:47.064 --> 05:48.465
One second.

05:58.976 --> 06:00.444
- Are you okay?
- I got her onboard,

06:00.577 --> 06:02.212
so where's that ship
you promised me?

06:02.346 --> 06:04.214
You're lucky you're
standing on this one.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.417
- Hold on. You promised me...
- I expect you to fucking move.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.252
Go on.

06:08.385 --> 06:09.852
Move.

06:12.523 --> 06:13.590
You're late.

06:15.925 --> 06:18.028
Hi, sir. I'm, uh, Noah.

06:18.162 --> 06:20.830
Let me guess.
You are the dead man walking

06:20.964 --> 06:22.832
that knocked up
my unmarried daughter

06:22.966 --> 06:24.301
and made her drop out
of West Point.

06:24.435 --> 06:26.303
No, this is not.
This man helped us.

06:26.437 --> 06:28.871
He helped us get on the ship,
saved my life,

06:29.006 --> 06:30.907
saved our lives.

06:32.409 --> 06:33.610
Is that right?

06:36.213 --> 06:38.182
I guess I owe you.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.849
No, sir.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.420
Glad you're safe.

06:44.488 --> 06:45.855
All right.

07:13.450 --> 07:15.352
I don't get
why you don't tell him.

07:15.486 --> 07:16.954
Your dad's
gonna find out eventually.

07:17.087 --> 07:19.590
I know. I can't wait
for him to know you.

07:19.723 --> 07:22.025
I just want that
to be in an environment

07:22.159 --> 07:23.761
where he can't
open a window and...

07:23.893 --> 07:26.330
boot you into space.

07:31.635 --> 07:33.704
- You excited for the mission?
- My "mission."

07:33.837 --> 07:34.872
Mm-hmm.

07:35.005 --> 07:36.173
You mean
the custodial department?

07:36.306 --> 07:39.009
Yeah. Man in overalls...

07:39.143 --> 07:42.079
cleaning toilets,
so much responsibility.

07:43.647 --> 07:45.215
It's gonna be fine.

07:45.349 --> 07:47.418
We're gonna get to New Earth,

07:47.551 --> 07:49.219
pop this sucker out,

07:49.353 --> 07:52.022
and then we get
to be a family.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.991
You promise?

07:55.025 --> 07:56.560
I promise.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.096
Okay.

08:05.436 --> 08:08.972
Six months from now,
it's you, me, and the little one

08:09.106 --> 08:11.074
on a New Earth beach.

08:13.744 --> 08:14.711
Hayley?

08:14.845 --> 08:16.113
Hayley!

08:23.954 --> 08:25.522
I love you.

08:48.779 --> 08:51.448
<i>50% of passengers in Cryo.</i>

09:46.336 --> 09:47.504
Yeah, Torpedo Clay.

09:47.638 --> 09:49.072
Thought you were
in fucking jail.

09:49.206 --> 09:51.141
Oh, my God.
You made it, motherfucker.

09:51.275 --> 09:52.609
- You all right?
- Clay Young,

09:52.743 --> 09:54.778
you beautiful soul.
How long's it been?

09:54.912 --> 09:57.414
Oh!

09:57.548 --> 09:59.216
Okay, all right. Fair enough.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.817
- I probably deserve that.
- All right?

10:06.958 --> 10:08.692
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.461
First jump?

10:11.595 --> 10:13.530
Just a little friendly advice.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.900
Would you get the fuck
out of my seat?

10:17.035 --> 10:18.402
Come on.

10:20.804 --> 10:22.806
There you go. Okay.

10:22.940 --> 10:24.374

Whoa.

11:41.019 --> 11:42.319
Holy shit.

11:42.452 --> 11:43.387
What happened?

11:43.520 --> 11:45.522
About 30 years.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.892
We're 30 years older?

11:49.027 --> 11:51.228
No, meatball,
30 years on Earth.

11:51.361 --> 11:52.796
It's quantum-release
time dilation.

11:52.929 --> 11:54.966
So if 30 years
passed on Earth...

11:55.099 --> 11:56.900
Everybody on Earth is dead.

11:57.035 --> 11:58.468
Look on the bright side, though.

11:58.602 --> 12:00.704
They're serving pancakes today.

12:15.352 --> 12:16.887
Think we'll ever return?

12:17.021 --> 12:20.290
We just left, and this
motherfucker wants to go back.

12:20.424 --> 12:21.458
- Home is Earth.
- Yeah?

12:21.591 --> 12:23.094
Well, we could wake the admiral,

12:23.226 --> 12:24.628
and we could see if he'll
flip this bitch around.

12:24.761 --> 12:26.229
Why are we even
going to New Earth?

12:26.363 --> 12:28.132
Just gonna fuck it up
like we did the last one.

12:28.265 --> 12:29.933
Earth, we hardly knew you.

12:30.068 --> 12:31.568
Maybe we're going 'cause we
don't wanna fucking die.

12:31.702 --> 12:33.570
Yeah, I thought
that was obvious.

12:33.704 --> 12:36.440
You're right, you know.
It's not like we learned anything.

12:36.573 --> 12:38.308
We're just a bunch
of intergalactic monkeys

12:38.442 --> 12:39.843
setting fires
across the universe.

12:41.211 --> 12:43.081
Clay telling
war stories again?

12:43.213 --> 12:45.183
I love the one about the admiral

12:45.315 --> 12:47.584
demoting his ass
for insubordination.

12:47.718 --> 12:51.022
Amazing.
We leave 19 billion behind,

12:51.155 --> 12:54.224
but this space Nazi,
he gets a seat.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.892
"Oh, I don't know, Admiral.

12:56.027 --> 12:58.662
I guess Clay just couldn't
cope with leaving Earth.

12:58.795 --> 13:03.700
Drank himself stupid
and jumped. Suicide."

13:10.074 --> 13:12.176
A stowaway, sir, the last one.

13:14.112 --> 13:15.545
Now...

13:15.679 --> 13:19.282
this is what happens
to stowaways,

13:19.416 --> 13:23.553
fuck-ups, and anyone plotting
against the admiral!

13:25.255 --> 13:27.457
- Take him away.
- Fuck you!

13:27.591 --> 13:29.426
Fuck you!

13:32.562 --> 13:35.099
All right! Listen up!

13:35.233 --> 13:39.103
The <i>Herc</i> will hit New Earth
in 182 days.

13:39.237 --> 13:42.405
Damn near all the ship,
including the admiral,

13:42.539 --> 13:43.607
will be in Cryo,

13:43.740 --> 13:46.610
which means I'm your commander,

13:46.743 --> 13:49.646
your king, your God Almighty.

13:49.780 --> 13:53.416
Your fellow crew members
will consist of six medics...

13:53.550 --> 13:54.918
Where are my medics?

13:55.052 --> 13:56.120
Six engineers...

13:56.254 --> 13:57.287
Where are my monkeys?

13:58.889 --> 14:02.392
Which leaves
five JAG officers and myself

14:02.526 --> 14:04.594
to police your sorry asses

14:04.728 --> 14:08.732
and five janitors to question
their lives' decisions.

14:08.865 --> 14:12.203
Any problems come up,
you fix 'em your damn selves.

14:12.369 --> 14:13.870
Understood?

14:14.005 --> 14:15.806
Breakfast is over.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.440
Move!

14:22.213 --> 14:24.414
Motherfucker.

14:30.988 --> 14:32.023
Well...

14:46.870 --> 14:51.842
<i>Arrival to
New Earth, T-minus 171 days.</i>

15:17.068 --> 15:18.368
Okay.

15:42.392 --> 15:43.793
What are you doing?

15:47.131 --> 15:50.101
I was just gonna ask you
the same thing.

15:53.570 --> 15:55.906
The shift starts in 60.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.608
Stanley will break your legs
if you're late.

15:58.742 --> 16:00.111
Hey, so if we're
gonna be bunk buddies,

16:00.244 --> 16:01.678
that mean we're working
the same shift?

16:01.811 --> 16:03.080
- Well, what do you think?
- Hey, how 'bout...

16:03.214 --> 16:04.982
- how 'bout we start over?
- Let's not.

16:05.116 --> 16:06.449
Hi. I'm Noah.

16:06.583 --> 16:08.685
Look, you want to get along,
do your job,

16:08.818 --> 16:11.188
don't touch my stuff,
don't talk to me,

16:11.322 --> 16:12.789
and do not snore.

16:12.923 --> 16:14.358
How will I know I'm snoring
if I'm asleep?

16:14.491 --> 16:16.360
Well, you'll know it
when I kick your teeth in.

16:16.493 --> 16:20.830
We got 59 minutes. Papa Clay
needs his beauty sleep.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.542
Start work tomorrow.

16:32.676 --> 16:34.378
Only two bathrooms
for the entire crew,

16:34.511 --> 16:36.347
so that's wonderful.

16:36.479 --> 16:37.514
Also, um...

16:37.647 --> 16:40.251
they say, 'cause of quant-speed,

16:40.384 --> 16:43.753
that time moves differently
for us than it does on Earth...

16:44.621 --> 16:46.090
so...

16:48.259 --> 16:49.726
your mom...

16:51.429 --> 16:53.697
the plague probably got her...

16:55.299 --> 16:56.900
along with everyone else.

17:00.704 --> 17:02.139
I had a dream last night.

17:03.807 --> 17:05.742
Yeah, I dreamt it was a girl.

17:06.876 --> 17:08.778
What are you doing, rook?

17:08.912 --> 17:11.048
You're late.
Let's go. Chop-chop.

17:11.182 --> 17:12.582
I'm going.

17:18.688 --> 17:20.723
Don't push me, rook.

17:20.857 --> 17:22.659
I'm a real nice guy.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.262
Just don't push me.

17:25.396 --> 17:28.265
All right?
You know what you're doing?

17:28.398 --> 17:29.566
Bathrooms, linens, mess hall.

17:29.699 --> 17:31.002
Maybe there's hope
for you yet.

17:31.135 --> 17:32.635
Not likely, but...

17:33.536 --> 17:34.871
maybe.

17:35.006 --> 17:37.607
There's your mop.
Here's your bucket.

17:37.741 --> 17:39.243
Time to rock-'n'-roll, kid.

17:41.544 --> 17:42.846
Here we go.

18:26.623 --> 18:30.627
Oh, no.

18:37.901 --> 18:40.371
Three, two, one...

18:40.504 --> 18:45.242
<i>Arrival to
New Earth, T-minus 86 days.</i>

18:46.576 --> 18:48.711
Made it to the halfway mark.

18:54.485 --> 18:55.718
We're almost home.

19:30.254 --> 19:32.156
<i>Access denied.</i>

19:33.491 --> 19:35.792
<i>Access denied.</i>

19:36.961 --> 19:38.996
What the fuck
is wrong with you guys?

19:39.130 --> 19:40.431
<i>Access denied.</i>

19:40.564 --> 19:43.134
Only the admiral
has access to the reactor!

20:56.806 --> 20:58.609
Hey, son...

20:58.741 --> 21:01.579
you snooping around
the reactor room?

21:01.711 --> 21:02.912
No, sir.

21:03.047 --> 21:04.181
I don't even know
where that is.

21:04.315 --> 21:07.017
If you saw anyone
acting strange or...

21:08.252 --> 21:09.954
messing with things
they shouldn't mess with,

21:10.087 --> 21:11.388
you'd tell me, right?

21:11.522 --> 21:12.755
Of course, sir.

21:14.391 --> 21:17.727
Lot of people are upset
about us leaving Earth.

21:19.129 --> 21:22.333
They think humankind
had its shot...

21:23.667 --> 21:24.934
that it's unnatural for us

21:25.069 --> 21:27.870
to be colonizing another planet.

21:30.407 --> 21:34.811
They'd rather torpedo this ship
than see us start over.

21:35.679 --> 21:37.481
So like I said...

21:38.549 --> 21:40.950
you see anyone acting strange...

21:41.952 --> 21:45.922
you'd tell me, right?

21:48.392 --> 21:49.826
Yes, sir.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.195
Good.

21:52.862 --> 21:54.198
Good.

22:05.042 --> 22:07.278
- What'd Stanley want?
- Nothing.

22:08.178 --> 22:09.380
If it's not coming off,

22:09.513 --> 22:10.847
you're not using
the strong stuff.

22:10.981 --> 22:12.416
Like what?

22:12.549 --> 22:15.619
Did you completely
dick off in training?

22:15.753 --> 22:20.591
Moxacell. You got to be careful,
or that shit'll melt your face.

22:23.027 --> 22:27.498
All I'm saying is the
Fermi paradox makes sense.

22:27.631 --> 22:31.101
What if... What if they're
not hiding in space, huh?

22:31.235 --> 22:33.370
Could they be hiding
in another time,

22:33.504 --> 22:34.705
another dimension?

22:34.837 --> 22:38.008
Well, everyone on the ship
is now a lot dumber

22:38.142 --> 22:39.576
from listening
to that conversation.

22:39.710 --> 22:42.546
Or could
another alien civilization

22:42.680 --> 22:45.882
have been hit
with an extinction-level event?

22:47.151 --> 22:49.787
I mean, we barely fucking
survived the Nuclear Age.

22:51.355 --> 22:52.956
The plague,
we still haven't cured...

22:53.090 --> 22:55.359
Right?

23:57.688 --> 23:58.655
Hmm...

23:58.789 --> 24:00.557
Moxacell.

24:00.691 --> 24:02.393
"Extreme cleaning power."

24:09.099 --> 24:10.734
Fuck.

24:10.868 --> 24:12.169
Oh, shit.

24:13.103 --> 24:14.338
Shit.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.582
"One drop per gallon of water."

24:27.117 --> 24:28.619
Come on.

24:41.665 --> 24:43.200
- Blue!
- Huh?

24:43.333 --> 24:45.002
Hurry it up, will you?

24:45.135 --> 24:47.337
What the fuck is the rush?

24:50.073 --> 24:52.376
Oh, God.

24:53.710 --> 24:56.613
Oh, yeah.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.950
We ain't
getting anything done.

25:05.422 --> 25:06.723
Anyway, I'm so fucking high,

25:06.857 --> 25:08.826
I couldn't even think
about working right now.

25:08.959 --> 25:10.627
Fuck that.

25:12.296 --> 25:13.597
What's up, man?

25:13.730 --> 25:15.599
I drank something earlier.

25:15.732 --> 25:17.100
You're starting
to freak me out, brother.

25:17.234 --> 25:18.402
Whoa!

25:18.535 --> 25:19.803
Seriously,
you fucking with me?

25:19.937 --> 25:21.905
Whoa! What, what, what?

25:22.039 --> 25:23.207
Oh, God! Ohh! Call Chambers!

25:23.340 --> 25:24.274
What do you mean,
"Call Chambers?"

25:24.408 --> 25:25.442
Call her now!

25:25.576 --> 25:27.344
What? Whoa, whoa!
Just get it out!

25:27.478 --> 25:28.912
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Get it out!

25:29.046 --> 25:31.315
Get what out?
You're fucking freaking me out!

25:32.816 --> 25:36.253
I'm burning! Agh!
Agh! It's burning!

25:36.386 --> 25:37.554
- Drink this!
- It's burns!

25:37.688 --> 25:39.223
Drink this!

25:44.595 --> 25:46.163
Good. Drink it.

25:48.932 --> 25:50.067
Oh, my God.

25:50.200 --> 25:52.669
Are you all right? You okay?

25:52.803 --> 25:54.304
Say something, bro.

25:54.438 --> 25:56.273
Say something. Shady.

25:56.406 --> 25:57.841
Shady!

25:59.978 --> 26:01.478
What do you know?

26:03.213 --> 26:05.048
Heartburn.

26:05.182 --> 26:06.116
Heartburn?

26:07.684 --> 26:09.119
You fucking idiot.

26:09.253 --> 26:11.655
What...

26:49.893 --> 26:52.596
Clay, I finished the floors.

26:57.067 --> 26:59.236
Clay, can I go?

27:10.147 --> 27:11.448
Clay!

27:31.401 --> 27:33.337
Clay, you in there?

28:26.189 --> 28:28.158
What are you doing?

28:30.694 --> 28:33.196
- Uh...
- You following me?

28:33.330 --> 28:35.899
- I...
- Let me ask you a question.

28:39.770 --> 28:41.905
- Sit down.
- What is all this?

28:42.439 --> 28:44.174
I said sit down!

28:58.388 --> 28:59.656
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

28:59.790 --> 29:01.425
- I just finished my shift. I...
- I saw Clay

29:01.558 --> 29:02.960
stealing jet fuel,
and he had Moxacell.

29:03.094 --> 29:05.228
- What? Spit it out.
- Clay's making a fucking bomb!

29:09.000 --> 29:10.467
Is that true, Clay?

29:15.039 --> 29:16.373
You got him?

29:21.344 --> 29:22.412
Right. Let's go.

29:22.546 --> 29:24.548
Come on! Stand up!

29:33.623 --> 29:35.358
I didn't see anything.

29:36.526 --> 29:37.694
Did you bring it?

29:37.828 --> 29:40.263
Do you want to start,
or should I?

29:40.397 --> 29:41.498
You know, he knows about you.

29:41.631 --> 29:43.567
What exactly
does the commander know?

29:43.700 --> 29:45.569
That you're
with the rebellion.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.671
That you're trying
to blow up the ship,

29:47.804 --> 29:49.974
trying to get revenge for all
those people you left behind.

29:50.108 --> 29:51.075
He said all that, huh?

29:51.209 --> 29:52.409
And if anything happens to me,

29:52.542 --> 29:53.844
he's gonna go looking.

29:56.480 --> 29:59.382
You guys should move back.
This could get messy.

30:06.958 --> 30:08.325
Make it easy, kid.

30:08.458 --> 30:10.427
Open your mouth.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.230
No, please.
I'm not gonna say anything.

30:12.362 --> 30:14.331
Open your mouth.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.100
Please, I have a family.
I have a family.

30:27.344 --> 30:28.980
What the fuck?

30:30.313 --> 30:32.183
Wait. So you're not making
a bomb. You're making...

30:32.315 --> 30:33.784
Moonshine.

30:33.917 --> 30:35.987
Well,
it's mostly acid cleaner.

30:36.120 --> 30:38.455
So... So you're not trying
to blow up the ship?

30:38.588 --> 30:39.723
What the hell
are you talking about?

30:39.856 --> 30:41.192
I saw you stealing fuel cells.

30:41.324 --> 30:43.326
Jet fuel,
gives it a good kick.

30:43.460 --> 30:45.029
Torpedo Clay's special recipe.

30:46.663 --> 30:50.234
So now that we know
and we know that you know,

30:50.367 --> 30:55.206
we, uh, think it's best
that we keep this between us.

30:55.338 --> 30:56.606
If Commander Stanley finds out,

30:56.740 --> 31:00.677
we are all looking
at a court-martial,

31:00.811 --> 31:02.579
all of us.

31:02.712 --> 31:03.914
And if I don't?

31:06.284 --> 31:07.551
Blackmailing me?

31:13.590 --> 31:15.592
Got 84 days.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.328
What do you say?

31:26.304 --> 31:27.504
All right!

31:27.637 --> 31:28.805
Let's have some fun.

31:28.939 --> 31:31.275
What do you think?

31:38.983 --> 31:40.684
- Oh, what was that?
- Hear, hear.

31:54.631 --> 31:56.133
We can confiscate their booze.

32:01.571 --> 32:02.974
So they paid an ad agency

32:03.107 --> 32:05.076
to come up with
the phrase "New Earth."

32:05.209 --> 32:07.011
I mean, shit,
I could come up with that.

32:07.144 --> 32:09.446
New Earth.
We fucked up the old,

32:09.579 --> 32:11.581
so here's a new one.

32:11.715 --> 32:13.383
My brother made it
on the first ship.

32:13.516 --> 32:15.452
Who do you have
waiting for you?

32:16.853 --> 32:17.587
Nobody.

32:17.721 --> 32:18.688
Just your family?

32:18.822 --> 32:20.091
I don't have a family.

32:20.224 --> 32:22.492
I thought you told us
you had a family.

32:23.526 --> 32:26.030
Um, back on Earth.

32:26.163 --> 32:28.798
Just my mom,
and she had to stay behind.

32:29.766 --> 32:31.601
So it's just me now.

32:35.705 --> 32:37.008
There was a girl.

32:37.141 --> 32:38.942
Ah, here we go.

32:39.076 --> 32:40.744
Alex.

32:42.113 --> 32:43.413
A real lady.

32:43.546 --> 32:45.149
Hmm.

32:45.283 --> 32:47.450
She married my brother.

32:48.852 --> 32:51.055
She married your brother?

32:51.188 --> 32:52.189
Is he still breathing?

32:52.323 --> 32:54.457
Clay's a lover, not a fighter.

32:54.591 --> 32:55.859
Ain't that right?

32:55.993 --> 32:58.528
One day, you're young, and...

32:58.662 --> 32:59.863
you got the world at your feet.

32:59.997 --> 33:04.068
And the next, you're, well...

33:04.935 --> 33:06.903
whatever the fuck we are.

33:07.904 --> 33:10.540
I'm gonna go find me some Blue.

33:10.674 --> 33:12.575
Where are those jackasses?

33:14.278 --> 33:16.646
If it's gonna fail, why go?

33:18.082 --> 33:20.217
Because I'm good
at failing up.

33:21.751 --> 33:23.687
Where are you
getting reassigned?

33:23.820 --> 33:25.522
- Reassigned?
- You know, the new job

33:25.655 --> 33:27.124
we get when we land.

33:27.258 --> 33:29.459
Oh. Um, butcher.

33:31.494 --> 33:33.630
Just not too fucking sharp.

33:43.207 --> 33:45.608
Blucher.

33:55.618 --> 33:56.753
Blucher!

33:58.189 --> 33:59.656
Where are you?

34:02.492 --> 34:05.196
Hey, where you been hiding?

34:07.098 --> 34:07.931
Blue.

34:08.065 --> 34:10.934
You only get one chance at this.

34:13.503 --> 34:15.538
Oh, jeez.

34:35.326 --> 34:38.628
<i>Locating New Earth assignment.</i>

34:42.065 --> 34:43.300
Garbageman.

34:43.434 --> 34:44.435
That's more like it.

34:44.567 --> 34:45.969
- Clay.
- Should have known.

34:46.103 --> 34:48.472
First jump.
You don't know your assignment.

34:48.638 --> 34:49.706
Can't clean for shit.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.541
Please. I-I can explain.

34:51.674 --> 34:53.511
Good.
I'm giving you 10 seconds

34:53.643 --> 34:54.811
before I call Stanley.

34:54.944 --> 34:56.347
No, look,
you don't understand.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.883
Five, four, three,
two, one.

35:00.017 --> 35:02.153
Okay, I wasn't picked
for New Earth.

35:03.054 --> 35:06.923
I'm...
I'm technically a stowaway.

35:07.058 --> 35:08.792
Do you know
what they do to stowaways?

35:08.925 --> 35:11.095
Okay, I lied before, okay?

35:11.228 --> 35:13.663
I do have a family,
and she's on the ship.

35:13.797 --> 35:15.099
Her name is...

35:16.833 --> 35:18.135
Hayley Adams.

35:23.307 --> 35:24.542
You idiot.

35:24.674 --> 35:28.279
You knocked up
the admiral's daughter.

35:28.412 --> 35:30.014
Are you suicidal?

35:30.147 --> 35:32.450
- I didn't know who her dad was.
- His face is everywhere!

35:32.582 --> 35:34.318
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here, okay?

35:34.452 --> 35:36.619
<i>Clay, report.</i>

35:36.753 --> 35:39.957
- Please, Clay.
- You know the shit you just put me in?

35:40.091 --> 35:41.925
Look, I'm just trying
to do right by them.

35:42.059 --> 35:44.794
<i>Clay, Goddamn it!
Where are you?</i>

35:44.928 --> 35:47.131
If you're gonna
tell him, just...

35:48.165 --> 35:51.168
I don't know, give me
a head start, at least, okay?

35:52.336 --> 35:53.703
Please?

35:54.871 --> 35:56.906
Clay? Clay.

36:05.282 --> 36:07.318
Jesus.

36:09.253 --> 36:10.387
Oh, what is this?

36:12.456 --> 36:13.424
Where's Blue?

36:13.557 --> 36:16.127
It's, um... it's Shady.

36:16.260 --> 36:18.028
What the hell
did you do to him?

36:18.162 --> 36:19.463
Teek found him like this.

36:19.597 --> 36:22.199
Shady is everywhere.

36:22.333 --> 36:24.934
So where the fuck
is Ensign Blucher?

36:25.069 --> 36:26.703
Blue couldn't have done this.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.606
I don't know
what could have done this.

36:28.771 --> 36:30.407
Uh, decompression, maybe,

36:30.541 --> 36:33.210
but, uh, if there
was a leak in the <i>Herc,</i>

36:33.344 --> 36:35.645
- we'd all be dead.
- Ortega's also missing.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.647
No, she's not.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.883
She just went
looking for Blue.

36:44.255 --> 36:46.056
Clay, we're calling up
the footage now,

36:46.190 --> 36:48.325
trying to figure out what happened,
but it might take a minute.

36:48.459 --> 36:50.760
We need to get
all the crew in on the search.

36:55.665 --> 36:57.601
I worked with Blue
for 10 years.

36:57.734 --> 36:59.270
He didn't do this.

37:04.108 --> 37:07.978
Kid, just in case I'm wrong,

37:08.112 --> 37:09.746
Blue's a big boy.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.248
Give him some room.

37:17.787 --> 37:19.056
Mmm.

37:23.594 --> 37:25.596
<i>Attention, all crew.</i>

37:25.728 --> 37:29.933
<i>Engineer Blucher Macon and
Senior Doctor Isabella Ortega</i>

37:30.067 --> 37:31.368
<i>have gone missing.</i>

37:32.503 --> 37:36.040
<i>Report at once
to begin a sweep of the ship.</i>

38:16.046 --> 38:17.281
Nothing. You?

38:17.414 --> 38:18.815
No.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.850
<i>Is the feed
telling us anything yet?</i>

38:20.985 --> 38:22.253
Not yet.
We're still searching.

38:22.386 --> 38:24.722
<i>All right.
Well, I found Ortega.</i>

38:24.854 --> 38:26.957
- What'd she say?
- Nothing.

38:31.996 --> 38:34.098
Blue bashed her head in.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.283
What do you think
he wants with the admiral?

40:03.320 --> 40:05.055
Blue, what the fuck
are you doing?

40:06.190 --> 40:07.491
We found Shady and Ortega.

40:08.325 --> 40:09.493
Come on, buddy.

40:09.626 --> 40:10.961
You want Stanley
to use his cannon?

40:11.095 --> 40:12.563
Drop the cutter.

40:14.965 --> 40:16.233
Turn around!

40:21.372 --> 40:24.575
Oh, fuck.
What happened to him?

40:24.708 --> 40:26.876
I'm ordering you
to lay down your weapon.

40:30.114 --> 40:32.182
Put your weapon down,
and surrender.

40:32.316 --> 40:34.651
It's your final warning.

40:34.785 --> 40:36.086
Lay down your fucking weapon!

40:36.220 --> 40:37.821
I don't think
he's gonna listen.

40:37.955 --> 40:41.525
Goddamn it, Blue.
He's gonna kill you.

40:48.098 --> 40:49.932
Shoot him!

40:57.508 --> 40:58.976
Jesus Christ,
how did he do that?

40:59.109 --> 41:00.477
We need to stop the bleeding.

41:03.447 --> 41:05.149
Can't find an artery.

41:07.950 --> 41:09.520
Is he dead?

41:14.224 --> 41:15.959
Is he dead?

41:16.593 --> 41:18.295
Yeah, he's gone.

41:20.898 --> 41:22.132
So is Xu.

41:33.143 --> 41:34.645
That's not just cabin fever.

41:34.778 --> 41:36.413
He ate Xu's neck.

41:37.614 --> 41:38.582
He ate it.

41:38.715 --> 41:40.484
We need to find out
what happened.

41:43.287 --> 41:46.056
What's taking so long
with the feed?

41:46.190 --> 41:47.991
I'm going as fast as I can.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.960
It's one room, Teek.

41:51.261 --> 41:53.197
Why does he look like that?

41:53.330 --> 41:54.598
Something seems to be

41:54.731 --> 41:56.500
dissolving him
from the inside out.

42:01.338 --> 42:03.740
We have to do an autopsy.
You guys go.

42:03.874 --> 42:05.342
I need to be alone.

42:29.766 --> 42:31.101
You okay?

42:56.827 --> 43:00.731
<i>Arriving to
New Earth, T-minus 85 days.</i>

43:13.076 --> 43:14.444
Anything?

43:14.578 --> 43:15.679
Not yet.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.781
Goddamn it.

43:24.755 --> 43:26.256
Dr. Susan Chambers,

43:26.390 --> 43:29.192
12:30 a.m., May 4th.

43:29.326 --> 43:30.861
I am beginning the autopsy.

43:30.995 --> 43:35.566
I will start collecting samples
for DNA sequencing.

44:23.880 --> 44:24.948
What happened?

44:25.083 --> 44:27.718
Stanley just locked us in.

44:50.774 --> 44:54.778
More time is needed
to evaluate these results.

44:54.911 --> 44:57.914
I will begin now
to make my first incision

44:58.049 --> 45:00.417
and visual assessment.

45:38.789 --> 45:39.856
<i>Just get it out!</i>

45:39.991 --> 45:41.358
- <i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>
- <i>Get it out!</i>

45:41.491 --> 45:43.027
<i>Get what out?</i>

45:45.929 --> 45:47.364
<i>There's nothing inside him.</i>

45:47.497 --> 45:49.433
<i>Drink that! Drink that!</i>

45:49.566 --> 45:51.368
What do you mean, nothing?

45:55.139 --> 45:57.340
What...

46:06.084 --> 46:08.318
I know you can hear me!

46:08.452 --> 46:10.253
How long
are we supposed to sit here?

46:10.387 --> 46:11.922
Hey, do you think
something happened?

46:12.056 --> 46:13.724
How the fuck would I know?

46:15.225 --> 46:16.560
Chambers!

46:17.028 --> 46:19.163
Teek! Somebody!

46:19.296 --> 46:21.364
Open the goddamn door!

46:26.037 --> 46:27.437
Let's go.

46:30.807 --> 46:33.343
So you misplaced some organs?

46:33.477 --> 46:35.746
No. I was alone
with Blue all night.

46:35.879 --> 46:37.581
When I cut him open,
his spleen, his heart,

46:37.714 --> 46:39.449
his nervous system, his blood

46:39.583 --> 46:41.485
had basically
been eaten down to nothing.

46:41.618 --> 46:43.687
Eaten? Like "eaten"?

46:43.820 --> 46:45.722
Wait. So if Blue didn't
have anything inside him...

46:45.856 --> 46:47.691
Then how could he still move?

46:47.824 --> 46:50.128
It's 'cause he was being
controlled from the inside.

46:50.260 --> 46:52.262
Let me show you something.

46:56.433 --> 46:58.635
The strand on the left
belongs to Blue,

46:58.769 --> 47:01.371
just like yours and mine...
proteins, lipids,

47:01.505 --> 47:04.441
the building blocks
of all life in the universe.

47:04.574 --> 47:07.778
Strand on the right, also Blue,

47:07.911 --> 47:10.214
except it's
not even carbon-based.

47:10.347 --> 47:11.915
It's not human.

47:14.185 --> 47:16.353
If I'm guessing...

47:16.486 --> 47:18.956
Blue picked up some sort
of virus or a parasite.

47:19.090 --> 47:22.526
Invades the body of the host and
then wears it like a cheap suit.

47:22.659 --> 47:23.760
So how did it get onboard?

47:23.894 --> 47:25.395
I had the ship
do a head count

47:25.529 --> 47:26.797
after you found Ortega,
just to make sure

47:26.930 --> 47:28.799
that nobody else
had gone missing,

47:28.932 --> 47:30.567
and I found this.

47:33.804 --> 47:35.605
Noah's not in the system.

47:35.739 --> 47:38.909
He's using forged papers.

47:39.043 --> 47:40.510
Don't fucking move!

47:40.644 --> 47:41.845
Wait, wait, wait.
I can explain...

47:41.979 --> 47:43.513
- I can explain.
- Hey, hey! Oh, whoa, whoa.

47:43.647 --> 47:45.682
- What was the fucking plan?
- No! I don't know!

47:45.816 --> 47:47.884
Infect the crew?
Then eat our guts

47:48.019 --> 47:49.053
while you sink the ship?

47:49.187 --> 47:50.188
No! Fucking no!

47:50.320 --> 47:51.255
He's not trying to kill us.

47:51.388 --> 47:52.489
He's just a scared kid

47:52.622 --> 47:54.424
trying to survive,
like the rest of us.

47:56.893 --> 47:58.328
Any more secrets?

48:06.736 --> 48:09.140
So if this asshole
didn't let it in,

48:09.273 --> 48:13.110
we need to find out who did
and what we're dealing with.

48:13.944 --> 48:15.512
Show them.

48:16.147 --> 48:17.881
They deserve to know.

48:30.360 --> 48:32.362
Holy shit.

48:39.736 --> 48:41.705
And look.

48:43.740 --> 48:44.976
They're not alone.

48:46.077 --> 48:48.478
So when you said parasite,
you meant...

48:48.612 --> 48:51.048
Alien. And it might
still be out there.

48:51.948 --> 48:55.019
If it's out there,
we kill it.

48:55.152 --> 48:56.220
What is it?

48:57.154 --> 48:59.123
- I don't know.
- Where did it come from?

48:59.257 --> 49:00.857
Again, I don't know.

49:00.992 --> 49:03.727
So how does a thing like that
sneak onboard without us knowing?

49:03.860 --> 49:06.130
Because somebody
had to bring it onboard.

49:08.732 --> 49:10.834
Do we know who did it?

49:12.569 --> 49:14.205
What are you doing?

49:14.338 --> 49:16.573
We have to wake up
the admiral.

49:16.706 --> 49:18.608
- No, we don't.
- Something is on this ship

49:18.742 --> 49:21.778
killing his men.
This is his responsibility.

49:21.912 --> 49:23.580
Well, the paranoid bastard

49:23.713 --> 49:26.217
made sure we couldn't
break into his quarters,

49:26.350 --> 49:28.052
let alone wake him from Cryo.

49:28.185 --> 49:29.486
And I don't trust
the stowaway,

49:29.619 --> 49:32.589
so he goes out the air lock.

49:33.357 --> 49:34.758
Stanley, let him go!

49:35.960 --> 49:37.028
Guys.

49:39.297 --> 49:40.530
Guys!

49:46.103 --> 49:48.005
Clay, look up!

50:05.256 --> 50:06.290
Fuck you, motherfucker!

50:50.867 --> 50:51.901
Get to the arsenal.

50:52.036 --> 50:53.670
Hey, the crew
are still locked in.

50:53.803 --> 50:55.572
<i>Cabin doors opening.</i>

50:55.705 --> 50:57.308
What's happening?

50:57.441 --> 50:58.742
Someone's letting them out.

50:58.875 --> 51:00.643
That's impossible.
Only Stanley can do that,

51:00.777 --> 51:01.945
and he's dead.

51:03.147 --> 51:04.848
Not anymore.

51:22.832 --> 51:24.235
Move! Move!

51:26.037 --> 51:28.671
- Did you find Blue yet?
- Run, you fucking idiots!

51:28.805 --> 51:30.041
Get inside! Lock the doors!

51:40.617 --> 51:42.086
What the fuck?

51:48.292 --> 51:49.326
- Go.
- What is it?

51:49.460 --> 51:50.593
I already told you I don't know.

51:50.727 --> 51:52.229
Blue, Ortega, and Xu
were all dead,

51:52.363 --> 51:54.697
so how the fuck is it
still able to control them?

51:54.831 --> 51:56.434
- I didn't bring it on the ship.
- Think! Try anything!

51:56.566 --> 51:58.768
- I said I don't know!
- Everybody knock it off!

51:58.902 --> 52:00.371
He doesn't know anything!

52:00.504 --> 52:02.239
Look, I didn't
fight my way onto the ship

52:02.373 --> 52:04.275
so I could kill anyone.

52:04.408 --> 52:06.177
I'm here so I could
protect my family.

52:06.310 --> 52:08.546
We won't have long
before they find us.

52:08.678 --> 52:10.713
Okay. Then what are we
supposed to do?

52:10.847 --> 52:12.749
- We need to get to security.
- What, and send a message?

52:12.882 --> 52:13.984
There's no signal
with JAG command

52:14.118 --> 52:15.519
until we're closer to New Earth.

52:15.652 --> 52:17.188
All right, Doc,
how do we kill it?

52:17.321 --> 52:19.223
I don't know.
Bullets only slowed them down.

52:19.356 --> 52:20.690
Brute force didn't work.

52:20.824 --> 52:22.293
What about fire?

52:23.360 --> 52:25.862
- Might work.
- Good enough for me.

52:25.996 --> 52:27.630
You remember how to use
one of those things?

52:27.764 --> 52:29.133
What do you think?

52:29.266 --> 52:30.434
Where are you going?

52:30.568 --> 52:32.103
- To get Hayley!
- Noah, stop!

52:32.236 --> 52:34.105
Listen.

52:38.509 --> 52:39.742
What is that?

52:39.876 --> 52:41.245
Get away from the door.

52:52.689 --> 52:54.924
Jesus Christ.

52:55.725 --> 52:57.194
They're all dead.

52:57.328 --> 52:59.463
Don't let 'em
trap us below-deck.

52:59.597 --> 53:01.298
We need to get
to the security bay.

53:10.807 --> 53:12.309
Light 'em up!

53:13.544 --> 53:16.013
Ahh! You fuckers!

53:16.547 --> 53:17.847
Stand back.

53:23.720 --> 53:26.056
It's not working! Keep firing!

53:31.529 --> 53:33.930
Fire alarm! Cover your eyes!

53:41.405 --> 53:43.240
Okay, it looks
like they're gone.

53:43.374 --> 53:44.874
We're sitting ducks in here.
We gotta move.

53:45.009 --> 53:46.243
Let's get to the security bay.

54:07.231 --> 54:08.798
- Can't see!
- Neither can they,

54:08.932 --> 54:10.767
so shut the fuck up.

54:30.387 --> 54:31.655
Where are you?

54:54.545 --> 54:56.213
I'll cover.

54:56.347 --> 54:58.082
Hey, guys,
can somebody tell me

54:58.215 --> 54:59.882
what the fuck is going on?

55:02.086 --> 55:03.687
Teek!

55:03.820 --> 55:05.356
I can't see him.

55:06.957 --> 55:08.259
Cover me.

55:09.693 --> 55:11.428
Wait!

55:11.562 --> 55:13.464
- Should we go after him?
- No. No, they're gone.

55:13.597 --> 55:14.531
Clay?

55:17.701 --> 55:18.736
We have to get out of here.

55:18.868 --> 55:20.803
- Just wait! Clay!
- Clay?

55:20.937 --> 55:22.172
If you can hear us...

55:22.306 --> 55:23.440
duck!

55:30.581 --> 55:31.814
Something's coming.

55:34.851 --> 55:37.054
- We gotta get off the ship.
- Escape pods are over there.

55:37.187 --> 55:39.156
Where are we gonna go?
We're nowhere near New Earth.

55:39.290 --> 55:40.890
All right, let's go
to the, uh, security bay.

55:41.025 --> 55:42.426
- Okay. Okay, this way.
- Come on. Let's go.

55:42.559 --> 55:43.761
Follow me. Follow me.

55:43.893 --> 55:46.130
I'm outta here.
You coming, kid?

55:48.966 --> 55:50.534
Good luck.

56:30.974 --> 56:33.444
- Where's your access card?
- Top right pocket.

56:36.347 --> 56:37.214
Got it.

56:37.348 --> 56:39.216
We gotta patch him up.

56:40.818 --> 56:42.186
I'm locking us in.

56:52.329 --> 56:55.299
Jesus! You been
working out, Stanley?

56:58.702 --> 57:00.371
Hey, Stanley.

57:02.872 --> 57:04.108
Come on.

57:05.809 --> 57:10.047
<i>Arrival to
New Earth, T-minus 84 days.</i>

57:16.286 --> 57:17.755
We have
nowhere left to go,

57:17.887 --> 57:20.491
and we have no one to call.
We need to be strategic.

57:20.624 --> 57:22.493
So tired
of fucking running.

57:22.626 --> 57:25.062
We need to face
these bastards head-on.

57:27.131 --> 57:28.931
We're all gonna die.

57:33.404 --> 57:34.838
Bullets won't work...

57:34.972 --> 57:36.206
fire...

57:37.608 --> 57:39.109
Can't be killed.

57:40.711 --> 57:41.979
It's death.

57:45.948 --> 57:47.251
Hey, guys...

57:49.019 --> 57:50.220
come up with a plan?

57:50.354 --> 57:52.289
I-I can't tell you
how to kill it

57:52.423 --> 57:54.291
if I don't know what it is.

57:57.728 --> 58:01.999
If someone brought it,
they had to have a reason.

58:06.170 --> 58:07.438
Well, we had a good run.

58:08.272 --> 58:09.973
Not bad for
a bunch of drunks.

58:10.107 --> 58:12.643
So we're supposed to sit here and
wait for them to tear us apart?

58:12.776 --> 58:13.844
No. We're gonna get drunk

58:13.977 --> 58:15.612
and wait for them
to tear us apart.

58:15.746 --> 58:17.681
- You think this is funny?
- You hear anyone laughing?

58:17.815 --> 58:19.650
We are outmatched, outgunned,

58:19.783 --> 58:22.319
and we need reinforcements.

58:22.453 --> 58:24.655
Aren't you supposed to be
some sort of fucking badass?

58:26.457 --> 58:27.825
You just looking out
for yourself?

58:27.958 --> 58:30.461
Yeah, so were you
when you snuck on the ship.

58:31.428 --> 58:33.664
No, I'm looking out
for my family.

58:35.699 --> 58:37.301
Who are you looking out for?

58:46.076 --> 58:47.578
Wait. Where does that go?

58:49.112 --> 58:50.614
The vent, where does it go?

58:50.747 --> 58:52.216
Vents go a lot of places.

58:52.349 --> 58:54.117
- Does it reach the admiral?
- Oh, shit.

58:54.251 --> 58:56.153
All right, damn you.

58:57.054 --> 58:58.957
Have it your way.
For the record,

58:59.089 --> 59:00.357
this is a terrible idea.

59:00.491 --> 59:01.859
But I'll give you a shot.

59:01.992 --> 59:04.695
You wake the admiral.
He blows 'em all up.

59:04.828 --> 59:05.996
You get your girl.

59:06.129 --> 59:07.931
Yeah. Easy.

59:08.065 --> 59:09.566
It's gonna be tight.

59:09.700 --> 59:13.303
Just keep moving,
and do exactly what I say.

59:13.437 --> 59:15.506
Aw, what are you
waiting for?

59:17.875 --> 59:19.576
Up and at 'em, hero.

59:42.399 --> 59:44.101
Which way do I go?

59:44.234 --> 59:45.536
Clay, can you hear me?

59:46.904 --> 59:48.438
Please stop doing that.

59:48.572 --> 59:50.140
First turn's coming up.

59:50.274 --> 59:53.110
After that, go 200 feet.

59:55.078 --> 59:57.080
Take your next two lefts.

59:57.214 --> 59:58.849
You wanna hurry it up, son?

01:00:01.118 --> 01:00:02.085
Taking first left.

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:03.453
- Now where?
- Stop.

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.489
- They're coming.
- What?

01:00:05.622 --> 01:00:08.191
They're all
around you. Move.

01:00:11.929 --> 01:00:13.397
Taking second left. Now what?

01:00:13.530 --> 01:00:15.699
Clay, what's happening?

01:00:18.468 --> 01:00:20.370
Hope they eat you first.

01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:41.491
I'm sorry.

01:00:49.499 --> 01:00:51.401
God, please forgive me.

01:00:51.535 --> 01:00:54.271
Don't start praying yet, Teek.

01:00:55.138 --> 01:00:56.807
Kid might be onto something.

01:01:07.451 --> 01:01:09.486
Clay.

01:01:09.620 --> 01:01:11.688
- Clay?
- I'll tell you when to stop.

01:01:11.822 --> 01:01:13.091
Listen to me.

01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:15.692
Xu and Ortega, they're here.

01:01:19.796 --> 01:01:22.132
They didn't see you.
Keep moving.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.209
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:01:34.979 --> 01:01:37.015
Almost there, kid.

01:01:37.147 --> 01:01:38.682
Keep going.

01:01:38.815 --> 01:01:41.184
I have to tell you
something. I...

01:01:46.323 --> 01:01:48.158
I did it. It was me.

01:01:51.828 --> 01:01:52.796
Teek.

01:01:52.929 --> 01:01:54.098
What did you do?

01:01:54.231 --> 01:01:55.198
Tell us.

01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:57.969
I-I thought it would be quick.

01:01:58.102 --> 01:01:59.803
I-I thought it would...

01:01:59.936 --> 01:02:01.505
I thought it would
kill us fast.

01:02:01.638 --> 01:02:02.739
Teek...

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.608
tell me what you did.

01:02:04.741 --> 01:02:06.309
- Teek.
- You're lying.

01:02:06.443 --> 01:02:08.512
- You didn't do it.
- It was me!

01:02:10.247 --> 01:02:12.215
They found me.

01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:15.252
Run!

01:02:22.259 --> 01:02:24.294
Left or right?
Left or right?

01:02:24.428 --> 01:02:25.762
Take a right.

01:02:29.933 --> 01:02:33.670
We're gonna die
because of you.

01:02:41.344 --> 01:02:42.679
Get up!

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.915
<i>Clay, what's going on?</i>

01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:46.650
I'll deal with you later.

01:02:47.718 --> 01:02:49.087
<i>Think I'm lost.</i>

01:02:49.619 --> 01:02:52.023
Where's Xu and Ortega?

01:02:59.496 --> 01:03:01.331
Which way do I go?

01:03:01.465 --> 01:03:03.333
There should be a vent
to your right.

01:03:28.391 --> 01:03:29.793
What's the holdup?

01:03:57.221 --> 01:03:59.890
You again.

01:04:08.532 --> 01:04:10.500
<i>Why would you
want to hurt us?</i>

01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:15.372
Everything's not about "us."

01:04:15.505 --> 01:04:18.341
There are 300,000 souls
on this ship,

01:04:18.475 --> 01:04:20.911
<i>good people just trying
to make a fresh start</i>

01:04:21.045 --> 01:04:22.445
<i>on a better planet.</i>

01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:24.048
Isn't that what you maniacs
preach about?

01:04:24.182 --> 01:04:25.283
What about them?

01:04:25.415 --> 01:04:27.018
Maybe mankind
had its chance.

01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:30.654
See, we can't keep destroying
everything that we touch.

01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:33.356
There's a lot of us who get it.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:36.793
We see humanity
for the parasite that it is.

01:04:38.229 --> 01:04:39.329
Shame on you.

01:04:39.462 --> 01:04:40.998
We get what we deserve.

01:04:41.132 --> 01:04:42.699
What is it?

01:04:43.533 --> 01:04:44.935
You brought it here.

01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:46.703
You don't know?

01:04:47.704 --> 01:04:48.973
Where'd it come from?

01:04:49.106 --> 01:04:52.375
<i>Did you find it?
You cook it up in a lab?</i>

01:04:52.509 --> 01:04:55.912
Did it fall from the sky?
Where is it from?

01:04:56.047 --> 01:04:57.380
The experiments.

01:04:57.514 --> 01:04:59.016
So they made it.

01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:01.319
No, we didn't make it.

01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:02.485
We brought it back.

01:05:02.619 --> 01:05:04.487
You brought it back
from where?

01:05:04.621 --> 01:05:08.658
Another planet?
Another universe?

01:05:09.793 --> 01:05:12.596
Maybe it was here
from before the universe.

01:05:12.729 --> 01:05:15.432
And it's gonna kill us all,
even you,

01:05:15.565 --> 01:05:17.969
because you told it to.

01:05:18.102 --> 01:05:19.170
No.

01:05:19.303 --> 01:05:21.005
Because it wants to.

01:05:21.938 --> 01:05:24.075
Because that's all it knows.

01:05:26.476 --> 01:05:29.046
<i>All right, all right,
I heard enough of this monster.</i>

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:32.016
Are you sober enough to return
to active service, Captain?

01:05:32.149 --> 01:05:33.583
Just like the old days.

01:05:33.717 --> 01:05:34.784
Anything else I should know?

01:05:34.918 --> 01:05:36.419
<i>It's getting smarter.</i>

01:05:36.553 --> 01:05:38.388
We've already found it
targeting the reactor

01:05:38.521 --> 01:05:39.756
and your bunker, sir.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:41.993
And where is this horde now?

01:05:46.197 --> 01:05:47.231
All right.

01:05:48.798 --> 01:05:50.634
There's no need
to complicate things.

01:05:51.668 --> 01:05:53.170
Let's kill 'em all,

01:05:53.304 --> 01:05:55.206
flush 'em out the air-vac.
How's that sound?

01:05:55.339 --> 01:05:57.108
Works for me, sir.

01:05:58.109 --> 01:06:00.044
Ah, look here.

01:06:01.845 --> 01:06:05.415
Wake 'em up. Strap up. Move out.

01:06:14.925 --> 01:06:19.263
We, uh, graduated
from the same academy.

01:06:19.397 --> 01:06:22.632
Majored in orbital warfare.

01:06:22.766 --> 01:06:24.969
- Clay?
- Once upon a time...

01:06:26.170 --> 01:06:27.837
he was a warrior.

01:06:27.972 --> 01:06:31.175
He disobeyed orders
during the Eos uprising.

01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:34.979
He refused to fire on
protestors during the riots.

01:06:35.112 --> 01:06:38.115
He got blue falconed
back to rear detachment.

01:06:38.249 --> 01:06:40.117
Wait a second.

01:06:40.251 --> 01:06:42.919
Hey, what's the status
on Cryo?

01:06:43.054 --> 01:06:45.189
Don't worry. She's fine.

01:06:45.323 --> 01:06:47.124
Who's fine?

01:06:47.258 --> 01:06:49.060
Hayley.

01:06:50.261 --> 01:06:51.628
You...

01:06:52.929 --> 01:06:54.597
you're the father.

01:06:54.731 --> 01:06:56.233
Whoa, sir.

01:06:56.367 --> 01:06:58.868
He's an idiot,
but he's our idiot.

01:07:01.105 --> 01:07:02.772
We might need him.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.809
I'll deal with you later.

01:07:06.676 --> 01:07:07.944
Commander!

01:07:09.013 --> 01:07:11.415
Orbital 1701,
ready to maim, murder,

01:07:11.548 --> 01:07:13.017
and kill on your command, sir.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:15.252
We are here to hunt.

01:07:15.386 --> 01:07:16.753
We are here to kill.

01:07:16.886 --> 01:07:18.755
We are here to survive.

01:07:18.888 --> 01:07:20.690
Lead the way, son.

01:07:31.668 --> 01:07:33.337
How much time do we have?

01:07:33.471 --> 01:07:36.706
About two seconds longer
than him.

01:08:09.173 --> 01:08:10.241
Here goes nothing.

01:08:17.281 --> 01:08:18.548
Watch your six.

01:08:19.417 --> 01:08:20.817
Safeties off.

01:08:57.121 --> 01:08:58.322
My God.

01:09:15.238 --> 01:09:16.673
Captain Stanley?

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.942
Is that you?

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:29.153
Okay. Have it your way.

01:09:52.243 --> 01:09:54.944
Secondary positions!
Go! Go!

01:09:57.181 --> 01:09:58.781
No, no, no!

01:11:53.197 --> 01:11:55.232
- Get inside!
- I know how to kill it!

01:11:58.569 --> 01:12:00.170
Little closer. Come on.

01:12:00.304 --> 01:12:03.940
Hey, kid, you tell Hayley
I think she'll be all right.

01:12:09.413 --> 01:12:10.981
W-wait!

01:12:44.847 --> 01:12:45.848
He blew himself up.

01:12:45.983 --> 01:12:48.385
That crazy motherfucker.

01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:52.855
So I guess it's over now.

01:12:54.857 --> 01:12:56.293
Hey! Where you going?

01:12:56.427 --> 01:12:58.962
- Get Hayley!
- Who's gonna mop this up?

01:13:14.144 --> 01:13:16.313
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

01:13:18.248 --> 01:13:19.983
What is this thing?

01:13:20.117 --> 01:13:21.918
We have to get out of here.

01:13:23.153 --> 01:13:25.589
Come on! Let's go!

01:13:31.995 --> 01:13:33.197
Where are we going?

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:34.798
To get Hayley
and get off the ship.

01:13:34.931 --> 01:13:38.935
Go where? We're a billion
miles from everywhere.

01:13:39.069 --> 01:13:41.338
What was that?

01:13:43.140 --> 01:13:44.441
Something new.

01:13:46.610 --> 01:13:47.877
Moxacell.

01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:49.213
Moxacell?

01:13:49.346 --> 01:13:50.848
I used it on Blue,
and it worked.

01:13:50.981 --> 01:13:52.483
And you're
just now telling us?

01:13:52.616 --> 01:13:53.883
You sure he was dead?

01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:55.252
This thing
has tricked us before.

01:13:55.386 --> 01:13:57.154
I watched him
melt away to nothing.

01:13:57.287 --> 01:14:00.190
Wh-where is it?

01:14:00.324 --> 01:14:01.392
That way.

01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:03.594
Clay, what about your stash?

01:14:03.727 --> 01:14:05.295
Where's the moonshine?

01:14:06.597 --> 01:14:08.265
Down in the arsenal.

01:14:30.721 --> 01:14:32.890
<i>Access to reactor granted.</i>

01:14:33.023 --> 01:14:34.625
<i>Welcome, Admiral.</i>

01:14:34.758 --> 01:14:37.895
<i>Be advised.
High counts of radiation.</i>

01:14:38.028 --> 01:14:39.963
<i>Do not expose skin.</i>

01:14:44.535 --> 01:14:46.136
We tried fire.

01:14:47.638 --> 01:14:50.607
Yeah, but this, this'll
melt them to jelly. Trust me.

01:14:50.741 --> 01:14:52.743
We just have to get close.

01:14:57.614 --> 01:14:58.682
Are they coming?

01:15:01.852 --> 01:15:03.454
What the fuck was that?

01:15:05.322 --> 01:15:06.890
The ship is shaking.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:09.593
<i>Estimated time
of arrival to New Earth</i>

01:15:09.726 --> 01:15:13.730
<i>has been updated to
T-minus 80 days and counting.</i>

01:15:13.864 --> 01:15:16.500
Eighty days?
Does that sound right?

01:15:18.268 --> 01:15:22.406
<i>Arrival in T-minus
79 days and counting.</i>

01:15:22.539 --> 01:15:25.375
No, how is that possible?

01:15:25.509 --> 01:15:28.812
<i>Updated. Seventy-eight days
and counting.</i>

01:15:28.946 --> 01:15:30.080
What's happening?

01:15:30.214 --> 01:15:32.182
They're hitting
the fucking gas.

01:15:39.656 --> 01:15:43.293
<i>Reactor power
increased to 60%.</i>

01:15:46.463 --> 01:15:50.334
<i>Reactor power increased to 67%.</i>

01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:55.305
They're overheating
the reactor.

01:15:55.439 --> 01:15:56.840
We can't take much more of this.

01:15:56.975 --> 01:15:58.542
- How did they even get inside?
- We let it.

01:15:58.675 --> 01:16:00.210
It tried for the reactor
with Blue.

01:16:00.344 --> 01:16:01.912
When that failed,
it went for the admiral,

01:16:02.045 --> 01:16:03.680
the only person on this ship
with access to the reactor,

01:16:03.814 --> 01:16:05.516
and when we stopped it,
it came for us,

01:16:05.649 --> 01:16:08.352
because it knew we would find
some way to wake him up.

01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.088
It's been playing us all along.

01:16:11.889 --> 01:16:13.423
Get away from the door.

01:16:17.828 --> 01:16:19.229
You gonna grab one of these?

01:16:21.899 --> 01:16:22.967
Has the ship changed course?

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:24.434
- What?
- No.

01:16:24.568 --> 01:16:26.069
And there's no aliens
trying to eat us?

01:16:26.203 --> 01:16:28.272
- They've left us alone?
- What the fuck?

01:16:28.405 --> 01:16:30.207
So we're on a ship
headed to New Earth

01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:32.977
at the speed of light
with an unstable reactor

01:16:33.143 --> 01:16:34.478
- and an alien?
- Yeah, we got it.

01:16:34.611 --> 01:16:37.180
So why kill 300,000 when you
can kill an entire planet?

01:16:37.314 --> 01:16:40.617
You're talking
about 50 million people.

01:16:40.751 --> 01:16:42.686
The last 50 million.

01:16:53.597 --> 01:16:55.332
All right.

01:16:55.866 --> 01:16:57.801
Who wants barbecue?

01:17:11.081 --> 01:17:12.649
I guess that worked.

01:17:17.087 --> 01:17:18.522
So that's it?

01:17:18.655 --> 01:17:20.157
No, this is
just what it looks like

01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:22.326
when everything's
been boiled in acid.

01:17:22.459 --> 01:17:24.728
All right, Doc. Wrap it up.

01:17:32.235 --> 01:17:34.072
Who in the hell
are these people?

01:17:34.204 --> 01:17:35.505
It must have run out of crew.

01:17:35.639 --> 01:17:37.075
It's infecting the passengers.

01:17:37.207 --> 01:17:39.077
Hayley.

01:17:39.209 --> 01:17:40.777
Goddamn it.

01:17:46.316 --> 01:17:48.251
We need to get them
away from the reactor.

01:17:48.385 --> 01:17:49.786
Come on!
We're right here!

01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:52.255
- Hey! Over here!
- Over here!

01:17:52.389 --> 01:17:53.657
They're not gonna stop.

01:17:55.892 --> 01:17:56.827
Burn 'em.

01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:09.172
It's working!

01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:20.084
There are too many.
We won't be able to get through.

01:18:20.217 --> 01:18:21.952
Get Hayley
to the escape pod.

01:18:22.086 --> 01:18:23.587
We'll cover you.

01:18:25.255 --> 01:18:27.724
Go!

01:18:47.277 --> 01:18:48.345
Hayley.

01:18:48.478 --> 01:18:50.614
Hayley. Hayley!

01:18:52.616 --> 01:18:53.884
I'll get you out.

01:18:58.056 --> 01:18:59.023
Hi.

01:18:59.157 --> 01:19:00.924
- Hey.
- We made it?

01:19:01.059 --> 01:19:02.693
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm.

01:19:08.799 --> 01:19:09.633
Here.

01:19:09.766 --> 01:19:11.468
- What is this for?
- We have to go.

01:19:11.601 --> 01:19:12.869
- Come on. Just trust me.
- What?

01:19:13.004 --> 01:19:14.571
Just trust me, all right?
We have to go.

01:19:14.705 --> 01:19:16.573
Right now, we have to go.

01:19:23.947 --> 01:19:25.482
Wait. Where's Dad?

01:19:26.349 --> 01:19:27.584
We gotta go.

01:19:29.053 --> 01:19:30.287
Noah.

01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:32.222
Come on.

01:19:32.957 --> 01:19:34.591
Where is he?

01:19:36.293 --> 01:19:40.363
Look, he sacrificed himself
so we could have a chance.

01:19:40.497 --> 01:19:41.732
I-I'm sorry,
but we have to go.

01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:43.201
Otherwise, it'll be
for nothing. Please.

01:19:43.333 --> 01:19:44.267
Wait.

01:19:44.401 --> 01:19:45.936
Watch out.

01:19:50.540 --> 01:19:52.110
What the fuck is that?

01:19:52.242 --> 01:19:53.510
We have to go!

01:19:56.446 --> 01:19:57.748
Clay, let's go!

01:19:57.881 --> 01:19:59.883
Let's get the fuck
off this ship!

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:09.259
Get to an escape pod.

01:20:09.392 --> 01:20:11.461
- What are you gonna do?
- Improvise!

01:20:13.197 --> 01:20:14.165
It's behind you!

01:20:22.305 --> 01:20:24.474
That is an ugly motherfucker.

01:20:24.608 --> 01:20:27.477
Clay. Clay, we've gotta go.

01:20:27.611 --> 01:20:29.780
Clay, we have to go
right fucking...

01:20:36.353 --> 01:20:37.420
Watch out.

01:20:37.554 --> 01:20:39.723
Fucking motherfucker.

01:20:42.325 --> 01:20:44.061
Get into the escape pod.

01:20:50.367 --> 01:20:53.370
Clay. Clay!

01:20:53.503 --> 01:20:54.771
Clay!

01:20:56.706 --> 01:20:59.309
Noah.
Noah, we have to go.

01:20:59.442 --> 01:21:01.878
Noah, we have to go!

01:21:03.247 --> 01:21:04.748
Hey!

01:21:05.849 --> 01:21:07.617
<i>Arrival to New Earth updated,</i>

01:21:07.751 --> 01:21:10.087
<i>T-minus 17 days and counting.</i>

01:21:12.190 --> 01:21:17.594
<i>Arrival to New Earth updated,
T-minus 15 days and counting.</i>

01:21:44.055 --> 01:21:45.422
Okay.

01:21:47.091 --> 01:21:49.026
- Get inside. Let's go.
- What are you doing?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:51.895
I have to hit the launchpad.
It's the only way to get us out of here.

01:21:52.029 --> 01:21:53.496
Be right back, okay?

01:22:33.436 --> 01:22:34.804
Come on.

01:24:52.575 --> 01:24:53.576
Oh, my God.

01:24:53.710 --> 01:24:55.346
Oh, my God. Okay.

01:25:00.317 --> 01:25:01.651
How you doing, kid?

01:25:02.386 --> 01:25:03.988
Clay, you're alive?

01:25:04.754 --> 01:25:07.091
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

01:25:07.224 --> 01:25:08.691
Can you get to us?

01:25:08.825 --> 01:25:11.128
The chambers are overrun.

01:25:12.363 --> 01:25:15.732
The ship's moving
too fast to stop it.

01:25:15.865 --> 01:25:17.168
It's over.

01:25:17.301 --> 01:25:19.437
Clay, there's 300,000
fucking people onboard.

01:25:19.569 --> 01:25:20.904
And you gotta save three.

01:25:21.038 --> 01:25:22.906
If you stay onboard,
you're gonna die.

01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:25.942
It'll talk a lot more
than aliens to kill me.

01:25:28.345 --> 01:25:29.447
<i>Adios, padre.</i>

01:25:29.579 --> 01:25:31.248
Clay, wait!

01:25:39.789 --> 01:25:41.158
Whoo-hoo!

01:25:52.503 --> 01:25:56.207
<i>Trajectory change detected.

<i>on a collision course

01:26:05.483 --> 01:26:06.850
Hey, Stanley.

01:26:07.351 --> 01:26:08.385
How you doing?

01:26:08.519 --> 01:26:09.487
You're looking good.

01:26:42.586 --> 01:26:43.887
Noah.

01:26:58.035 --> 01:27:01.138
<i>Commencing reentry
to New Earth.</i>

01:28:25.788 --> 01:28:27.324
Is that a little kid?

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:30.494
Hey!

01:28:32.029 --> 01:28:33.863
We were on the ship from Earth!

01:28:33.998 --> 01:28:35.466
We need help.

01:29:05.729 --> 01:29:07.398
Noah, it's the baby.

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.008
What are we gonna do?

01:29:26.150 --> 01:29:27.518
Burn 'em all.
