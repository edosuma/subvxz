00:02.168 --> 00:03.835
The prophecy says
that the seeker

00:03.836 --> 00:05.036
<i>Will defeat darken rahl.</i>

00:05.037 --> 00:07.038
Thanks to the seeker,
that monster is dead

00:07.039 --> 00:08.940
<i>And rotting for all eternity
in the underworld.</i>

00:08.941 --> 00:10.609
Kneel before the keeper.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.611
Forgive me, master.
I have failed you.

00:12.612 --> 00:14.546
No, you have succeeded

00:14.547 --> 00:16.146
<i>Exactly as I intended.</i>

00:16.148 --> 00:17.349
It's a tear in the veil

00:17.350 --> 00:19.217
That separates the underworld
from the living.

00:19.218 --> 00:20.552
This happened
when I killed rahl.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.020
As long as it's open
there's no way

00:22.021 --> 00:23.555
To prevent the keeper
of the underworld

00:23.556 --> 00:25.423
<i>From sending his minions
to bring death</i>

00:25.424 --> 00:26.958
<i>To every living thing.</i>

00:26.959 --> 00:28.059
The only way to close the rift

00:28.060 --> 00:29.828
Is the way the creator
sealed the underworld.

00:29.829 --> 00:32.430
The stone of tears.
We'll find it.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.032
Seek out the abbot of ulrich,

00:34.033 --> 00:36.201
<i>For he keeps the secret of
the stone close to his heart.</i>

00:36.202 --> 00:39.004
She's the one who helped me
kill darken rahl.

00:39.005 --> 00:40.605
She did it to save
her own skin.

00:40.606 --> 00:42.274
If you're foolish enough
to turn down

00:42.275 --> 00:44.542
The throne of d'hara,
then you need me all the more.

00:44.543 --> 00:45.710
If this is some sort of trick,

00:45.711 --> 00:46.878
I will kill you.

00:48.114 --> 00:49.147
Mark of the keeper.

00:49.148 --> 00:51.716
The one who would
destroy all life.

00:51.717 --> 00:56.454
Richard cypher,
you are the true seeker.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.844 --> 01:20.278
Thanks for letting me
borrow this.

01:20.279 --> 01:24.416
Although I can't say it helped
me sleep more soundly.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.817
It's gonna take a while
to get used

01:25.818 --> 01:28.253
To having
a mord-sith in camp.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.855
Well, if richard trusts cara,

01:30.856 --> 01:34.559
I suppose we'll have
to learn to as well.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.808
Does it hurt?

01:49.809 --> 01:50.975
It's nothing.

01:55.281 --> 01:57.082
The spirit of the tyrant
you killed

01:57.083 --> 01:58.249
Comes back from the grave

01:58.250 --> 02:01.886
And burns the mark of the keeper
in your chest?

02:01.887 --> 02:04.489
It's not nothing, richard.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.094
I wish I knew
what it meant.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.229
What we do know is that we need
to seal the rift

02:11.230 --> 02:12.997
Between this world
and the underworld.

02:12.998 --> 02:15.233
And to do that, we need to find
the stone of tears,

02:15.234 --> 02:20.372
And to find the stone, we need
to get to the abbot of ulrich.

02:35.988 --> 02:38.223
It must have burned at least
three months ago.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.658
These weeds
are at least that old.

02:40.659 --> 02:41.893
D'harans did this.

02:41.894 --> 02:44.729
Then where are the corpses?

02:44.730 --> 02:45.930
If the abbot isn't here,

02:45.931 --> 02:47.999
Then we've come a long way
for nothing.

02:50.202 --> 02:52.303
If d'harans did this,

02:52.304 --> 02:54.339
And they didn't
kill the monks,

02:54.340 --> 02:55.974
Where would they
have taken them?

02:55.975 --> 02:58.810
From here, they would have been
taken to tothrayne.

02:58.811 --> 03:00.745
What's tothrayne?

03:00.746 --> 03:03.581
A death camp.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.197
No, please, no!

03:19.198 --> 03:21.099
I have a son!

03:21.100 --> 03:24.169
The war is over!

03:24.170 --> 03:26.337
I don't want to die!

03:34.480 --> 03:36.815
Move! The faster
you get this loaded,

03:36.816 --> 03:38.716
The faster
you'll get your reward.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.332
General, why are we still

03:54.333 --> 03:56.301
Executing prisoners?

03:56.302 --> 03:58.803
The war is over.

03:58.804 --> 04:02.674
We should be getting
far away from this place.

04:02.675 --> 04:06.377
You've heard the reports
of reprisals against d'harans.

04:06.378 --> 04:09.280
The best way to ensure
there are no reprisals

04:09.281 --> 04:11.382
For what's been done here

04:11.383 --> 04:13.818
Is to make certain that no one
lives to tell the tale.

04:15.387 --> 04:17.021
Don't worry, commander.

04:17.022 --> 04:20.692
We'll take this treasure
and we'll be faaway from here

04:20.692 --> 04:23.895
By the time anyone comes
looking for retribution.

04:28.434 --> 04:32.170
Just as soon as we've finished
the task at hand.

04:32.171 --> 04:34.105
Stay there!

04:41.547 --> 04:43.047
And now
here's your reward.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.021
All right,
I'll do you a favor.

04:50.022 --> 04:51.623
I'll leave it loose.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.558
You'll take longer to die.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.400
The seeker. Kill him!

05:16.315 --> 05:17.549
Thanks for the favor.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.053
Bless you, seeker.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.824
We're looking
for the abbot of ulrich.

07:06.825 --> 07:09.427
We believe
he was brought here.

07:09.428 --> 07:13.531
I'm sorry, I don't know
anything about the abbot.

07:13.532 --> 07:16.067
There are children here
we have to free.

07:16.068 --> 07:19.737
The d'harans didn't just come
for resistance fighters.

07:19.738 --> 07:20.905
They took our families too.

07:20.906 --> 07:22.507
Where are they?

07:24.109 --> 07:25.777
Come. I'll show you.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.647
it's all right.

07:29.648 --> 07:31.382
You're safe.

07:31.383 --> 07:34.285
I need to find my son.

07:34.286 --> 07:35.620
What's his name?

07:35.621 --> 07:38.222
William. I'm eleanor.

07:38.223 --> 07:40.591
Don't worry.
I'll help you find him.

07:40.592 --> 07:42.794
Mother!

07:42.795 --> 07:45.396
William! William!

07:45.397 --> 07:46.631
Oh!

07:50.703 --> 07:53.938
I thought I'd lost you.

07:53.939 --> 07:57.542
Oh, thank the spirits
you're safe!

08:01.180 --> 08:02.613
The abbot of ulrich.

08:02.614 --> 08:04.415
He was brought here.

08:04.416 --> 08:06.150
Where is he?

08:06.151 --> 08:09.854
The general had him
executed yesterday.

08:11.824 --> 08:13.791
I tried to stop
the executions.

08:13.792 --> 08:16.728
You didn't try hard enough.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.063
We all lived in fear
of the general.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.699
There's a reason
that we called him the butcher.

08:21.700 --> 08:23.801
If we hadn't
followed his orders

08:23.802 --> 08:25.336
It would've been our necks
in nooses.

08:25.337 --> 08:27.772
It may still be.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.608
But that's for
the mother confessor to decide.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.513
Lock them in the cells.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.183
We came here
for the abbot.

08:40.184 --> 08:42.120
He's dead.

08:42.121 --> 08:44.087
There's no reason
for us to stay.

08:44.089 --> 08:46.357
Look at these people.

08:46.358 --> 08:48.426
They're sick, they're scared.

08:48.427 --> 08:49.794
They have no place to go.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.729
We can't just
leave them here.

08:53.999 --> 08:55.933
There's already enough sickness
in this place.

08:58.837 --> 09:01.706
Let's bury these bodies
before it gets any worse.

09:58.297 --> 09:59.530
Lord rahl?

09:59.531 --> 10:03.100
You served me well in life,
general.

10:04.603 --> 10:07.271
It is my hope that you will
do the same for the keeper,

10:07.272 --> 10:09.006
Now that you are dead.

10:09.007 --> 10:11.342
I don't understand.

10:11.343 --> 10:12.810
It's quite simple.

10:12.811 --> 10:15.613
The keeper of the underworld

10:15.614 --> 10:18.583
Wants to make you an offer.

10:29.423 --> 10:30.924
Those of you
that are well enough

10:30.925 --> 10:33.259
To travel are free to leave,
but those of you that aren't,

10:33.260 --> 10:35.695
We'll be making a camp
just outside the prison.

10:38.799 --> 10:41.034
If these prisoners are going
to gain their strength back,

10:41.035 --> 10:43.269
We're gonna have to feed them
something more substantial

10:43.270 --> 10:47.173
Than d'haran gruel.
Should we draw them warm baths?

10:47.174 --> 10:49.676
Do you know of anyone heading
in the direction of deerfork?

10:50.050 --> 10:52.864
The dragon corps wiped out
deerfork months ago.

10:55.015 --> 10:56.716
But that's
my father's village.

10:56.717 --> 11:00.253
We'll try to find out where
the survivors have relocated.

11:00.254 --> 11:02.855
Deerfork was a resistance
stronghold.

11:02.856 --> 11:05.358
No one would've been
left alive.

11:06.493 --> 11:08.394
My father wasn't
a resistance fighter.

11:08.395 --> 11:10.830
He was just a locksmith.

11:10.831 --> 11:12.932
That would've made no difference
to the dragon corps.

11:14.668 --> 11:16.469
Where will we go?

11:16.470 --> 11:20.339
The rest of my family
died here.

11:23.844 --> 11:27.013
I am so sorry
for your loss.

11:27.014 --> 11:29.749
But you need to be strong
for your son.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.318
We'll see what we can find out
about your father.

11:37.591 --> 11:39.859
You shouldn't give her
false hope.

11:42.429 --> 11:43.796
It wasn't so long ago

11:43.797 --> 11:45.798
That you served the one
who caused all this misery.

11:45.799 --> 11:48.801
At least try to show
some compassion.

11:51.872 --> 11:53.005
Come with me.

12:00.414 --> 12:01.681
I checked the store rooms.

12:01.682 --> 12:03.150
There's barely enough
to feed the rats.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.113
How can there be this many
people with no food?

12:06.113 --> 12:09.123
When the war ended,
supply shipments stopped.

12:09.733 --> 12:11.160
What food there was
went to the guards.

12:11.836 --> 12:13.259
The d'harans would sooner
put a knife in our bellies

12:13.260 --> 12:15.345
Than a hot meal.
I'm sending cara out

12:15.345 --> 12:16.160
To get provisions.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.464
Hopefully there'll be enough
for everyone.

12:18.465 --> 12:20.132
Move.

12:22.769 --> 12:23.703
Everyone?

12:25.505 --> 12:28.007
We'd have more if we didn't have
so many mouths to feed.

12:28.008 --> 12:30.309
The d'harans will be brought
to justice,

12:30.310 --> 12:32.511
But we're not gonna
starve them to get it.

12:33.619 --> 12:35.314
Yes, mother confessor.

12:37.484 --> 12:39.251
I need a horse.

12:43.423 --> 12:45.992
We need the horses
to get provisions.

12:45.993 --> 12:48.728
You can bury him outside
with the others.

12:48.729 --> 12:51.530
I'm not burying my brother

12:51.531 --> 12:53.299
Alongside the d'harans
who killed him.

12:53.300 --> 12:55.668
He should be laid to rest
beside our mother and father.

12:55.669 --> 12:57.570
We're going to need fresh water.

12:57.571 --> 12:59.372
My village is half a day's ride.

12:59.373 --> 13:01.507
I'll have the horse back
to you by morning.

13:01.508 --> 13:02.775
Check on the sister.

13:05.545 --> 13:07.013
Do it quickly.

13:11.952 --> 13:14.387
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:35.069 --> 13:35.441
Seeker?

13:38.913 --> 13:40.546
I heard you were looking
for abbot henry.

13:42.816 --> 13:44.684
I was a member of his order.

13:44.685 --> 13:46.986
We need to confide in you
a great secret.

13:46.987 --> 13:48.354
There's been a tear
in the veil

13:48.355 --> 13:50.156
Between this world
and the underworld.

13:50.157 --> 13:53.259
The keeper is waging war
on the land of the living.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.795
He's using the rift to send
horrible creatures

13:55.796 --> 13:57.063
Into our world.

13:57.064 --> 13:59.498
And the only way
to close this rift

13:59.499 --> 14:01.600
Is for us to find
the stone of tears.

14:01.601 --> 14:03.703
We were told that abbot henry
had knowledge

14:03.704 --> 14:05.504
Of the secret location
of the stone.

14:05.505 --> 14:09.508
The abbots of our order
always wore a locket.

14:09.509 --> 14:12.244
It has a rose inscribed
on its face

14:12.245 --> 14:15.114
And it was passed down
from abbot to abbot.

14:15.115 --> 14:18.017
Shota said the abbot would keep
the secret close to his heart.

14:18.018 --> 14:20.953
The d'harans took the locket

14:20.954 --> 14:22.955
When they brought us
to this awful place.

14:24.691 --> 14:27.493
We lived in peace until
the d'harans came.

14:28.729 --> 14:29.762
Seize the abbot.

14:29.763 --> 14:30.863
What is this?

14:30.864 --> 14:32.932
What is the meaning of this?

14:32.933 --> 14:33.966
You have no authority here.

14:36.303 --> 14:37.570
There's no need for this.

14:37.571 --> 14:38.971
We're men of peace.

14:40.440 --> 14:43.409
No! No! Please!

14:43.410 --> 14:45.811
Please! That's sacred!

14:45.812 --> 14:47.446
Anything taken from the abbot

14:47.447 --> 14:49.048
<i>Would've been kept
with the valuables</i>

14:49.049 --> 14:51.717
<i>We took from the other
prisoners.</i>

14:51.718 --> 14:55.221
It was the butcher's plan
to escape with the treasure.

14:55.222 --> 14:56.889
To disappear,

14:56.890 --> 15:01.227
And use it to make new lives
for himself and his men.

15:01.228 --> 15:03.062
Now the treasure can help us
give the prisoners

15:03.063 --> 15:05.965
Their lives back. Open it.

16:05.125 --> 16:07.426
I've seen him before.

16:11.398 --> 16:12.865
A man came to the stables

16:12.866 --> 16:15.568
Asking for a horse so he could
take his brother to be buried.

16:15.569 --> 16:17.570
Apparently he took
the treasure instead.

16:17.571 --> 16:18.671
And you believed
his story?

16:21.842 --> 16:24.076
The confessor told me
I had to show more compassion.

16:24.077 --> 16:26.679
Are you saying
this is my fault?

16:26.680 --> 16:28.347
Yes.

16:28.348 --> 16:31.083
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

16:31.084 --> 16:32.384
We need to find him.

16:47.616 --> 16:49.322
I came to give them some food.

16:50.003 --> 16:51.136
Did you see who did this?

16:55.842 --> 16:56.976
It was the butcher.

16:59.913 --> 17:02.781
He's come back
from the grave.

17:07.346 --> 17:10.548
Quickly, everyone get inside.

17:10.549 --> 17:12.817
This way.

17:18.857 --> 17:20.825
Is it true
what they're saying?

17:20.826 --> 17:23.461
That the butcher
killed those people?

17:23.462 --> 17:25.363
I don't know.

17:25.364 --> 17:26.830
But you'll be safe
inside the prison.

17:30.435 --> 17:32.069
We need to set up a guard
through the night,

17:32.070 --> 17:33.604
Make sure no one
gets in or out.

17:33.605 --> 17:34.839
I can take first watch.

17:36.041 --> 17:38.743
Keep the doors locked.
Keep everyone inside.

17:38.744 --> 17:39.977
That won't stop him.

17:39.978 --> 17:41.813
I got to see what
the butcher was capable of

17:41.814 --> 17:43.581
When he killed my friends.

17:43.582 --> 17:45.116
If he has come back
to take his revenge,

17:45.117 --> 17:47.518
He won't stop
until he's killed us all.

17:47.519 --> 17:50.087
Whoever it is,
we'll keep them out.

17:50.088 --> 17:51.589
But just in case.

18:02.801 --> 18:04.435
I've looked everywhere.

18:04.436 --> 18:07.071
There's no sign of whoever
murdered these men.

18:07.072 --> 18:09.073
Is it possible
the rumors are true?

18:09.074 --> 18:10.641
The butcher's come back
from the grave?

18:10.642 --> 18:12.743
Like darken rahl did.

18:12.744 --> 18:14.912
Darken rahl was just a spirit.

18:14.913 --> 18:17.248
Spirits don't have bodies.

18:17.249 --> 18:20.818
They can't pick up knives
and slaughter people.

18:20.819 --> 18:23.187
Well, we're going to find
who did.

18:23.188 --> 18:24.755
In the meantime,

18:24.756 --> 18:27.191
I need you to find the man
who stole the abbot's locket.

18:27.192 --> 18:29.527
He can't
have gotten far.

18:31.630 --> 18:33.798
I don't want him tortured
or killed.

18:33.799 --> 18:35.199
Bring him back alive.

18:35.200 --> 18:38.069
I'll do my best.

18:40.973 --> 18:42.740
If this butcher's escaped
from the grave,

18:42.741 --> 18:46.244
I'd like to see it
for myself.

18:53.285 --> 18:55.720
Someone dug him up.

18:55.721 --> 18:58.022
No.

18:58.023 --> 18:59.624
He clawed his way out.

19:09.501 --> 19:12.803
So did the rest
of the d'harans we buried.

19:18.243 --> 19:20.344
Could this be the work
of the keeper?

19:20.345 --> 19:21.512
Darken rahl?

19:23.081 --> 19:24.282
It's possible.

19:27.686 --> 19:29.687
Who else could bring
the dead back to life?

19:29.688 --> 19:32.123
The mord-sith.

19:34.092 --> 19:36.327
Cara's with us now.

19:36.328 --> 19:38.562
Why would she come all this way
to resurrect some d'harans

19:38.563 --> 19:39.897
With the breath of life?

19:39.898 --> 19:43.301
She served rahl
and fought side-by-side

19:43.302 --> 19:45.202
With the d'harans for years.

19:45.203 --> 19:47.405
Cara helped me defeat rahl.

19:47.406 --> 19:48.673
That should earn her
some trust.

19:53.145 --> 19:56.180
Whoever did this,
however it happened,

19:56.181 --> 19:57.481
We have a big problem.

20:00.619 --> 20:03.054
How do you kill something
that's already dead?

20:05.924 --> 20:08.092
We have to find them first.

20:12.631 --> 20:15.299
I'm not here to harm you.
Who are you?

20:15.300 --> 20:18.269
I am abbot henry.

20:21.773 --> 20:24.875
The d'harans told us
that you had been hung.

20:26.678 --> 20:28.612
After the d'harans
executed me,

20:28.613 --> 20:31.482
I awoke in the underworld.

20:31.483 --> 20:36.921
<i>In a pit of unimaginable
suffering,</i>

20:36.922 --> 20:41.125
<i>I was greeted
by darken rahl himself.</i>

20:41.126 --> 20:42.660
Rahl?

20:42.661 --> 20:47.164
He told me that the keeper
wished to make me an offer.

20:47.165 --> 20:52.970
He would allow me to return
to the land of the living,

20:52.971 --> 20:55.840
But he demanded
an awful price.

20:58.710 --> 21:00.511
In exchange
for letting me live again,

21:02.481 --> 21:06.484
I had to agree
to kill for the keeper.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.653
He made you a baneling.

21:12.758 --> 21:15.159
Banelings are dead souls

21:15.160 --> 21:17.862
Who selfishly bargain
for a second life

21:17.863 --> 21:21.599
In exchange for killing others.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.601
I thought they were
just a legend.

21:23.602 --> 21:25.036
So did I,

21:25.037 --> 21:27.471
But it seems the keeper
is using the tear in the veil

21:27.472 --> 21:29.507
To give the dead a chance

21:29.508 --> 21:31.442
To return to the world
of the living.

21:31.443 --> 21:34.078
I guess the butcher and his men
accepted his offer.

21:36.248 --> 21:39.316
So can anyone who die
become a baneling?

21:39.317 --> 21:41.352
Maybe not.

21:41.353 --> 21:44.155
Maybe only
in places like tothrayne.

21:44.156 --> 21:47.091
The veil between our world
and the underworld

21:47.092 --> 21:49.894
Is weakest in places
of great death.

21:49.895 --> 21:51.862
The rift is growing.

21:51.863 --> 21:53.397
If we don't close it soon,

21:53.398 --> 21:55.366
The keeper could send banelings
back anywhere.

21:59.171 --> 22:01.272
We need to find
the stone of tears

22:01.273 --> 22:03.340
To close the rift in the veil.

22:03.341 --> 22:05.843
Brother bertrand told us
that the secret of the stone

22:05.844 --> 22:07.311
Was inside your locket.

22:07.312 --> 22:09.280
Yes.

22:09.281 --> 22:12.983
That's why I had to take
the keeper's offer.

22:12.984 --> 22:17.755
To reclaim the locket and ensure
the stone's location

22:17.756 --> 22:19.356
Wasn't lost forever.

22:19.357 --> 22:21.559
Well, we're trying to find
the locket right now.

22:22.928 --> 22:24.929
what's wrong?

22:29.401 --> 22:32.303
I haven't fulfilled my end
of the keeper's bargain.

22:33.672 --> 22:37.208
I haven't killed anyone yet.

22:37.209 --> 22:41.045
I'm being called back
to the underworld.

22:50.522 --> 22:53.691
Tell us what we need to do
with the locket.

22:53.692 --> 22:55.926
I spent years learning
the rituals I would need

22:55.927 --> 22:57.828
To pass on to you.

22:57.829 --> 23:00.231
There's simply not enough time.

23:03.435 --> 23:05.769
Well, we have to buy you time.

23:07.172 --> 23:09.173
How?

23:12.744 --> 23:14.211
You have to kill someone.

23:28.593 --> 23:30.261
I'm not sure I can do this.

23:30.262 --> 23:31.662
You'll be killing a d'haran

23:31.663 --> 23:34.064
Guilty of horrible crimes.

23:35.433 --> 23:37.468
It may be the only way
to defeat the keeper.

23:51.116 --> 23:53.384
They're already dead.

24:04.309 --> 24:07.211
We have to find someone else
for him to kill.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.080
There's no time.

24:10.081 --> 24:13.684
You must listen to me.

24:13.685 --> 24:17.888
The locket contains
a runescriber.

24:17.889 --> 24:21.492
The magic imprints a rune

24:21.493 --> 24:23.761
Onto the palm
of the one who opens it.

24:25.297 --> 24:30.034
You must take the rune
to the province of pamorah.

24:30.035 --> 24:33.170
The rune is the key

24:33.171 --> 24:35.372
That will open the--

24:59.297 --> 25:01.131
What about me?

25:03.101 --> 25:04.735
Don't I get any?

25:04.736 --> 25:08.005
Oh, there's plenty
to go around.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.717
Sorry to interrupt.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.986
I know you're mourning
the loss of your brother.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.856
We all grieve
in our own way.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.999
Where's the treasure?

25:37.035 --> 25:38.469
I'm not afraid of you.

25:38.470 --> 25:42.039
Do you know what horrible things
they did to me at tothrayne?

25:42.040 --> 25:43.507
Intimately.

25:43.508 --> 25:46.410
I didn't break when
they put me on the rack

25:46.411 --> 25:48.245
Or when they threw me
in the drowning pool,

25:48.246 --> 25:51.515
Or when they spun me
on the wheel of pain.

25:51.516 --> 25:54.418
Torture me all you want.

25:54.419 --> 25:56.253
You'll be wasting
your time.

25:56.254 --> 25:58.923
Oh, I don't want
to torture you.

25:58.924 --> 26:01.358
I have other ways
of loosening your tongue.

26:03.628 --> 26:08.465
After the awful way
they treated you in that place,

26:08.466 --> 26:10.000
I can see why you would hire
those women

26:10.001 --> 26:11.468
To bring you some comfort.

26:13.204 --> 26:15.806
But I'll do things to you
those women can't even imagine.

26:17.175 --> 26:20.144
Many know of a mord-sith's
ability to bring pain,

26:20.145 --> 26:24.214
But few know we are equally
skilled at bringing pleasure.

26:26.785 --> 26:29.920
First, I'm going to...

26:38.830 --> 26:41.332
And then I'll...

26:49.374 --> 26:52.576
But first
you need to tell me where--

26:52.577 --> 26:54.878
In a cave
three leagues outside town.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.313
At the fork in the river.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.249
Get dressed.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.185
But I told you
where the treasure was.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.953
Take me to it.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.255
Now.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.658
What about that thing
you were going to do?

27:07.659 --> 27:10.227
And that other thing
sounded good too.

27:10.228 --> 27:14.098
All right, all right.
Just the first thing, then.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.038
The rune is the key,
but a key to what?

27:16.038 --> 27:18.602
We have no idea what to do
with it once we get there.

27:18.602 --> 27:19.567
We have a bigger problem:

27:19.567 --> 27:21.381
The butcher and his men are
out somewhere

27:21.381 --> 27:22.283
And they need to kill.

27:23.900 --> 27:25.210
But who killed these men?

27:26.940 --> 27:28.629
The butcher wouldn't bother
with a locked cell

27:28.629 --> 27:30.577
When there's much easier prey
within these walls.

27:30.577 --> 27:33.250
Who else would
want them dead?

27:33.251 --> 27:35.953
I'm sure any prisoner would want
revenge against the d'harans.

27:40.522 --> 27:42.674
But only one of them
had keys to the cells.

27:43.082 --> 27:44.100
Who?

27:44.402 --> 27:45.531
A prisoner.

27:45.764 --> 27:47.131
A resistance fighter.

27:47.132 --> 27:48.832
Find him.

27:53.104 --> 27:54.698
What's stopping
these dead d'harans

27:54.698 --> 27:56.380
From taking the keeper's deal

27:56.380 --> 27:58.443
And becoming banelings
themselves?

28:00.791 --> 28:02.789
You said banelings are creatures
of the flesh.

28:04.387 --> 28:08.324
When their souls return to this
world, they need a body.

28:09.359 --> 28:10.320
What are you thinking?

28:11.457 --> 28:13.190
We burn them, zedd.

28:32.677 --> 28:33.811
Richard.

28:38.616 --> 28:39.850
This is what
you're looking for.

28:44.322 --> 28:46.523
Did you open this?

28:46.524 --> 28:47.925
Answer me.

28:47.926 --> 28:49.526
Yes.

28:49.527 --> 28:51.862
Some strange ink came out
and did this.

28:53.698 --> 28:54.965
What?

28:54.966 --> 28:58.669
You've been marked
by powerful magic, boy.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.838
We have to take him
with us to pamorah.

29:00.839 --> 29:02.372
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.878
Take him to kahlan.
Have her confess him.

29:07.879 --> 29:10.547
No. We don't know how
the confessor's touch

29:10.548 --> 29:12.449
Will affect the rune's magic.

29:12.450 --> 29:15.352
Seems this is worth
quite a bit to you.

29:15.353 --> 29:16.854
At least as much
as the treasure.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.790
You want me to go with you
to this pamorah?

29:19.791 --> 29:20.958
It'll cost you.

29:20.959 --> 29:22.659
You're not getting
the treasure.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.395
Well, then, I guess I'm not
going anywhere.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.397
And this hand goes
where I go.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.032
Not if I cut it off.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.002
When do we leave?

29:32.003 --> 29:33.737
Lock him
in the warden's office

29:33.738 --> 29:35.005
Until we deal
with the banelings.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.851
You know,
this would be a good place

29:47.852 --> 29:49.419
For you to keep up
your end of our bargain.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.291
Hey. Hey!

29:56.194 --> 29:58.562
Hey! Hey!

29:59.998 --> 30:02.900
Our thief won't be going
anywhere without us.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.434
You brought him back
without a scratch.

30:04.435 --> 30:05.803
How'd you manage that?

30:05.804 --> 30:08.005
I have other methods.

30:09.374 --> 30:10.641
What kind of methods?

30:14.012 --> 30:16.113
Well, however you did it,

30:16.114 --> 30:17.414
It's good work.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.650
Did you expect anything less?

30:19.651 --> 30:21.852
I'm just glad to have you
on our side.

30:21.853 --> 30:23.720
Maybe you can tell
zedd and kahlan

30:23.721 --> 30:26.156
That they can stop sleeping with
weapons under their pillows.

30:28.594 --> 30:31.095
The d'haran guards
were killed on your watch.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.364
I gave you keys
to the cells and a weapon.

30:33.365 --> 30:37.301
You wanted revenge
for the death of your friends?

30:37.302 --> 30:39.737
I won't lie to you,
mother confessor.

30:39.738 --> 30:41.539
After what they did
to my friends,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.174
I'm not sorry
they're dead.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.943
I'm just sorry I wasn't
the one who did it.

30:50.882 --> 30:53.317
I believe you.

30:53.318 --> 30:56.687
Which means there's still
a killer out there.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.046
Look, you can let me out.

31:22.047 --> 31:24.682
I'm not going to try
to escape.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.234
I'll go with you
to this pamorah.

32:01.700 --> 32:02.650
He's dead.

32:04.564 --> 32:06.691
He was the key
to the stone of tears.

32:28.856 --> 32:30.056
Please, don't hurt me.

32:33.761 --> 32:35.528
There's nothing to fear here.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.049
Where am I?

32:40.335 --> 32:41.165
In the underworld.

32:43.004 --> 32:45.438
I-- I'm dead?

32:45.439 --> 32:47.173
Yes.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.309
But you don't have
to remain that way.

32:49.310 --> 32:53.413
All the keeper asks is that
in exchange for life,

32:53.414 --> 32:55.882
You kill for him.

32:57.218 --> 32:58.418
No, please!

33:00.087 --> 33:01.388
You bear the rune.

33:11.799 --> 33:13.566
No!

33:18.906 --> 33:21.074
Are you all right?
Can you talk?

33:24.578 --> 33:27.147
I-- I thought I was dead.

33:27.148 --> 33:28.248
I brought you back.

33:30.952 --> 33:32.786
You're welcome.

33:38.459 --> 33:39.793
I saw darken rahl.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.063
Darken rahl?

33:43.064 --> 33:45.198
Who stabbed you?

33:47.335 --> 33:49.302
At first I couldn't figure out

33:49.303 --> 33:53.340
How you got into a locked cell
to kill the d'harans.

33:53.341 --> 33:56.343
But then I remembered.

33:56.344 --> 33:58.745
You're the daughter
of a locksmith.

34:00.414 --> 34:04.017
You must have died
before we arrived.

34:04.018 --> 34:06.920
I only accepted
the keeper's offer

34:06.921 --> 34:08.922
So that I could
watch over william.

34:08.922 --> 34:13.525
This war has already made
so many orphans.

34:13.527 --> 34:15.527
I couldn't bear the thought
of my son

34:15.529 --> 34:19.766
Being so alone
and helpless.

34:21.335 --> 34:24.371
I had to keep killing
to satisfy the keeper.

34:24.371 --> 34:28.108
But after what
the d'harans did to us,

34:28.109 --> 34:29.576
They deserved it.

34:29.577 --> 34:32.445
And when you ran out
of d'harans?

34:32.446 --> 34:36.850
Wouldn't you kill to protect
the ones you love?

34:42.857 --> 34:46.159
You know we can't let you
kill any more people.

34:49.597 --> 34:52.264
Promise me

34:52.266 --> 34:56.268
That you'll make sure
my william is safe.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.929
We need to get to the armory and
grab every weapon we can find.

35:22.930 --> 35:24.764
And how will we find
the butcher and his men?

35:24.765 --> 35:26.533
Well, they need to kill.

35:26.534 --> 35:28.568
They'll go where they can find
the easiest prey.

35:47.088 --> 35:48.655
That's the last of them.

35:48.656 --> 35:50.523
We'll need more.

35:50.524 --> 35:54.294
Then we'll head north.

35:54.295 --> 35:56.596
I have a more important task
for you, general.

35:57.932 --> 35:59.032
My lord.

36:01.035 --> 36:03.837
You must capture the one who
bears the rune of pamorah.

36:03.838 --> 36:06.940
Tell me where
I can find him.

36:06.941 --> 36:09.008
He's in tothrayne.

36:09.009 --> 36:12.479
But my lord,
the seeker is there.

36:14.482 --> 36:16.116
Then you don't have much time.

36:16.117 --> 36:19.219
The runebearer is the key
to finding the stone of tears.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.387
If the seeker
should acquire the stone,

36:21.388 --> 36:24.691
Then the rift between
the two worlds will be closed,

36:24.692 --> 36:28.495
And all of you returned
to the underworld.

36:28.496 --> 36:30.230
I will not fail you.

36:32.100 --> 36:33.767
Kahlan is keeping
everyone safe.

36:33.768 --> 36:36.452
You, cara and I are going
to track the banelings.

36:36.452 --> 36:37.774
And when we find them?

36:37.774 --> 36:40.260
We trap them and burn them.

36:42.276 --> 36:43.718
We're not gonna
need the horses.

36:55.022 --> 36:57.372
Give us the one
who bears the rune.

37:10.279 --> 37:12.948
Again!
Put your backs into it, men!

37:15.451 --> 37:16.818
When flynn was in
the underworld,

37:16.819 --> 37:18.086
Rahl must've seen the rune.

37:18.087 --> 37:19.712
He must know it's the key
to the stone of tears.

37:19.712 --> 37:20.463
These walls are strong.

37:20.463 --> 37:22.242
If the banelings can't
get to us, they can't kill

37:22.242 --> 37:23.855
And they'll die again.

37:23.855 --> 37:25.750
He'll just send his men
to find more victims.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.867
They'll grown stronger out there
while we grow weaker in here.

37:30.006 --> 37:31.208
They're not gonna stop
until they get in.

37:31.744 --> 37:33.560
Well, if they want in,
we'll let them come.

37:34.518 --> 37:35.948
And what about kahlan
and all the others?

37:36.374 --> 37:37.528
We'll get them out the back way.

37:38.490 --> 37:40.698
This is a prison.
There is no back way.

37:41.635 --> 37:42.600
We can make one.

37:49.619 --> 37:52.954
Quickly!
Let's go, come on.

37:52.955 --> 37:54.723
Hang on.

37:54.724 --> 37:56.424
Hurry.

37:58.628 --> 37:59.995
Come on.

38:11.274 --> 38:13.208
They've all gone.

38:13.209 --> 38:14.209
Not all of us.

38:22.318 --> 38:23.685
Welcome back to tothrayne.

39:02.291 --> 39:03.658
After all the suffering

39:03.659 --> 39:05.593
These people have been through,

39:05.594 --> 39:07.595
Now they'll have a chance
to rebuild their lives.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.464
Zedd's already helping them
with that.

39:13.402 --> 39:14.602
That's for you.

39:14.603 --> 39:15.770
Thank you.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.806
For your family.

39:17.807 --> 39:19.040
Thank you.

39:19.041 --> 39:20.475
You know,

39:20.476 --> 39:22.844
It's a long road to pamorah.

39:22.845 --> 39:24.946
It could get
a little lonely.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.414
You're right.

39:28.984 --> 39:32.153
It is a long road
to pamorah.

39:33.589 --> 39:35.490
aah!

39:35.491 --> 39:37.258
And if you want to make
it there in one piece,

39:37.259 --> 39:39.427
You won't try my patience.

39:39.428 --> 39:41.596
The seeker said
you needed me alive.

39:41.597 --> 39:43.631
Yes.

39:43.632 --> 39:46.568
But he didn't say
you had to be comfortable.

39:59.615 --> 40:02.917
William, this is bertrand.

40:02.918 --> 40:05.019
He's gonna take you
to a place called timberfalls.

40:05.020 --> 40:07.689
There's a family there
that can't wait to meet you.

40:07.690 --> 40:09.891
I think
you'll like it there.

40:09.892 --> 40:11.393
Lots of children
to play with.

40:11.394 --> 40:13.695
Does that sound all right?

40:22.071 --> 40:23.671
Thank you. Goodbye.

40:47.797 --> 40:49.197
Now I know what rahl meant

40:49.198 --> 40:50.965
When he said I was marked
for the keeper.

40:52.435 --> 40:54.803
With every person I kill,

40:54.804 --> 40:57.672
I'm giving the keeper another
soldier to add to his army.

41:01.343 --> 41:04.012
Killing my enemies
only makes him stronger.

41:04.013 --> 41:06.514
It's not just your enemies.

41:06.515 --> 41:08.283
It's people like eleanor.

41:08.284 --> 41:10.652
Good people desperate enough
to accept the keeper's offer.

41:10.653 --> 41:15.523
He's using their desire for life
to create more death.

41:17.827 --> 41:20.395
Then can we risk
killing our enemies?

41:21.831 --> 41:24.532
We don't have a choice.

41:24.533 --> 41:27.435
If we have to kill to save
an innocent life, we'll do it.

41:29.438 --> 41:32.273
No matter how many souls
the keeper claims,

41:32.274 --> 41:34.676
As long as there are even a few
people left to create life,

41:34.677 --> 41:38.213
<i>And as long as people are
willing to protect that life,</i>

41:38.214 --> 41:39.547
<i>The keeper can't win.</i>

41:39.548 --> 41:42.116
It's just over
this next hill.

41:43.619 --> 41:47.021
You know, the other children
will be so excited to see you.

41:49.558 --> 41:50.892
Hey, uh...

41:56.265 --> 41:57.565
You all right, william?

42:03.038 --> 42:04.138
Are you hurt?

42:13.082 --> 42:14.315
You're a baneling.
