00:02.045 --> 00:04.255
<i>Previously on Marvel's</i>
Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:04.422 --> 00:06.049
Fitz, it's been 10 years.

00:06.132 --> 00:08.218
We can't waste any more time.

00:08.468 --> 00:10.804
Alisha came to us.
She was worried about her friends.

00:10.929 --> 00:12.263
<i>Nobody saw that attack coming.</i>

00:14.391 --> 00:15.433
<i>His name's James.</i>

00:15.558 --> 00:16.685
He was never given powers.

00:16.768 --> 00:18.144
- That's Kree.
- What does it do?

00:18.269 --> 00:20.814
Well, if I could figure that out,
I would be doing that instead of this.

00:20.939 --> 00:22.982
He connects to the Inhumans.

00:23.108 --> 00:25.151
<i>And they instantly joined the hive.</i>

00:25.819 --> 00:27.195
I have to get back to the base.

00:27.278 --> 00:28.321
<i>They have something we need.</i>

01:00.103 --> 01:01.479
How's it coming?

01:01.604 --> 01:02.939
Just needs a quick reboot.

01:08.653 --> 01:10.155
Thank you.

01:17.454 --> 01:18.496
Tests come back?

01:18.621 --> 01:19.914
Daisy's the only one infected.

01:19.998 --> 01:21.249
So Joey and Elena...

01:21.332 --> 01:22.876
Touched down at the Cocoon.
But Lincoln...

01:23.001 --> 01:24.335
Refused to leave. I know.

01:24.461 --> 01:25.628
How's he holding up?

01:25.712 --> 01:27.130
No one comes to me with their feelings.

01:27.213 --> 01:28.673
Yeah, that makes sense.

01:28.798 --> 01:29.841
What about the base?

01:29.966 --> 01:31.301
Still working on fortifying it.

01:31.384 --> 01:34.262
In the meantime, all vital data's
been transferred to Zephyr One.

01:34.345 --> 01:35.513
And we're easy prey.

01:35.638 --> 01:37.974
Daisy could lead
that giant maggot here any second.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.893
- I thought he was a parasite.
- Yeah, but aren't maggots...

01:40.018 --> 01:41.060
- I don't really...
- Me either.

01:41.186 --> 01:43.062
My take? That thing
could care less about S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:43.188 --> 01:44.606
You think this because...

01:44.689 --> 01:47.108
No one's digging any graves.

01:47.192 --> 01:49.611
We both know Daisy's strength,
what she could've done.

01:49.694 --> 01:52.071
And she took the Terrigen
and that ancient Kree, whatever it is.

01:52.197 --> 01:53.281
And then she left.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.700
Yeah, but not before she busted
the hydraulics on the hangar doors.

01:55.825 --> 01:56.826
We lost our exit.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.745
Because she doesn't want us
to follow her.

01:58.870 --> 02:00.663
Daisy's my partner.

02:00.747 --> 02:02.040
I should've known. I should've seen...

02:02.165 --> 02:04.709
Don't. We've all taken
enough beatings as it is.

02:05.710 --> 02:07.545
I noticed Coulson wasn't in the med bay.

02:07.670 --> 02:08.797
He shouldn't be up and around.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.006
He's readying the Zephyr.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.592
You saw the bone sticking out of
his leg, right? I mean, he should be...

02:12.717 --> 02:14.469
Resting? I told him that. Didn't sit well.

02:14.552 --> 02:15.970
He said he needs everyone in the air.

02:16.054 --> 02:17.806
The hangar doors are still jammed.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.432
We managed to pry them open halfway,

02:19.557 --> 02:21.684
but until I get a new feed pump,
we're grounded.

02:21.768 --> 02:23.269
Not necessarily.

02:23.394 --> 02:24.604
Coulson has another way.

02:24.729 --> 02:26.022
But it's risky

02:26.105 --> 02:27.565
and irresponsible.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.236
Then, why are you smiling?

02:32.445 --> 02:34.864
Daisy's still one of us.

02:34.948 --> 02:36.741
What she did here
was not of her own free will.

02:37.408 --> 02:39.619
Hive infected her. She's his hostage.

02:40.078 --> 02:41.371
We need to remember that.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.207
But this alien creature
messed with the wrong team.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.254
It thinks if it breaks our legs,
we'll stop fighting,

02:50.213 --> 02:52.549
<i>but it doesn't know
how damn stubborn we are,</i>

02:52.632 --> 02:54.592
<i>especially when it comes to
protecting our own.</i>

02:54.717 --> 02:56.469
Hive is building an Inhuman army,

02:56.803 --> 02:58.388
but we're not gonna let that happen.

02:59.138 --> 03:00.306
So strap in.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.434
Because you might feel
a little sick after this.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.308
You came here often.

03:44.142 --> 03:45.768
I see why.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.980
I was a different person
the last time I was here.

03:50.607 --> 03:52.650
That's how you know
about this place, right?

03:53.192 --> 03:54.652
Because I told my S.O.

03:55.486 --> 03:57.947
You used to drive
your van up here to sleep.

03:59.324 --> 04:01.284
You don't just have his face.

04:02.285 --> 04:03.328
You have his memories.

04:06.956 --> 04:08.166
He was fond of you,

04:08.875 --> 04:10.001
Grant Ward.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.378
And I'm glad he's dead.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.673
He is, too. In a way.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.384
Grant was a thirsty soul.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.345
And he suffered for it.

04:21.471 --> 04:23.181
You're so different from him.

04:23.556 --> 04:25.683
Just being around you, I can feel it.

04:26.684 --> 04:29.228
It's like this emptiness
I've always had is gone.

04:29.354 --> 04:31.022
<i>You're saying
Daisy's addicted to this thing?</i>

04:31.522 --> 04:33.691
It's the closest scientific explanation
that we've got.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.318
She said she was happier
than she's ever been.

04:35.401 --> 04:36.986
Wanted me to experience
the same thing.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.322
Most parasites have one goal,
attack and weaken its host.

04:39.405 --> 04:40.615
But Hive does the opposite.

04:40.698 --> 04:42.575
Its parasites swarm
the brain's pleasure centre,

04:42.700 --> 04:43.910
releasing so much dopamine that...

04:44.035 --> 04:47.163
Infected Inhumans not only feel
bulletproof, they actually are.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.165
Well, at least when it comes
to a dendrotoxin.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.917
We took tissue samples
from Lucio and...

04:51.042 --> 04:52.210
So ICERs don't work on them.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.378
- No.
- I'm afraid not.

04:55.088 --> 04:57.340
Okay. Then, how do we disinfect Daisy?

04:57.423 --> 04:59.258
Well, meet Dr Holden Radcliffe,

04:59.384 --> 05:00.593
a fellow Scotsman.

05:00.718 --> 05:02.929
He was lead researcher
on parasitic organisms

05:03.054 --> 05:04.806
at the agrochemical lab we raided.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.057
Based on his expertise,

05:06.182 --> 05:08.351
we believe he's our key
to finding a cure for Daisy.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.269
That facility and everyone in it
were wiped clean.

05:10.395 --> 05:11.396
How did Radcliffe escape?

05:11.521 --> 05:13.189
He didn't have to,
'cause he wasn't actually there.

05:13.272 --> 05:14.857
He was asked to step down
a month before

05:14.941 --> 05:17.026
for conducting irregular experiments.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.236
"Irregular," meaning?

05:18.361 --> 05:19.612
He's a rumoured transhumanist.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.322
A what?

05:21.406 --> 05:23.282
People who believe in using
science and technology

05:23.408 --> 05:25.994
to transcend our biological limitations.
Their goal is to...

05:26.077 --> 05:28.413
Become more than human. Timely.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.790
Digital immortality, super intelligence...

05:30.915 --> 05:32.625
Okay, I'm glad
everyone knows what it is.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.877
So, where is Dr Radcliffe?

05:34.961 --> 05:37.380
We think Romania, but his exact
whereabouts are unknown.

05:37.463 --> 05:39.799
Okay. That's enough to go on.
You two are taking point.

05:40.717 --> 05:43.219
I'll send Mack with you to run back-end,
whatever you need.

05:43.302 --> 05:45.930
Just find Dr Radcliffe and get us a cure.

05:50.727 --> 05:52.020
You're awfully quiet.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.813
Just got a lot on my mind.

05:56.274 --> 05:57.984
- I'll see you in the Quinjet, buddy.
- Yeah.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.445
Uh, Jemma,

06:00.570 --> 06:01.821
I know it's not a good time,
but can we speak

06:01.946 --> 06:04.032
about what happened
between us last night?

06:04.115 --> 06:06.075
Professionally speaking, I mean.

06:06.159 --> 06:07.493
Of course, Dr Fitz.

06:07.618 --> 06:09.787
We are colleagues, after all.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.290
That we are, Dr Simmons, and...

06:12.415 --> 06:14.125
Uh, that we are.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.420
It's that working relationship
which I would like to keep intact.

06:17.503 --> 06:19.797
Yes, we wouldn't want anything
to interfere with it.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.507
Exactly. Um...

06:21.632 --> 06:24.719
So, that's why, as... As...

06:24.802 --> 06:27.430
As things progress with our...

06:28.806 --> 06:30.683
We should consider

06:31.517 --> 06:33.644
all variables as we move forward,

06:33.770 --> 06:35.980
because things are bound to get

06:36.606 --> 06:37.732
complicated.

06:37.815 --> 06:39.150
You mean once we have sex?

06:39.984 --> 06:40.985
Simmons.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.653
I'll see you in the Quinjet.

06:45.156 --> 06:47.658
Here. Remember your training.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.704
But we're just going to have
a chat with a scientist.

06:51.829 --> 06:53.331
And how would I ever know if I need to...

06:53.456 --> 06:54.707
If it makes sense here.

06:56.042 --> 06:57.335
Sorry. I'm not sure
where you're pointing.

06:57.877 --> 06:59.003
Your gut.

07:14.727 --> 07:16.312
Do you think they'll come after you?

07:18.356 --> 07:19.649
I don't know.

07:20.149 --> 07:22.735
- Coulson, he's...
- A driven man.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.195
Especially when it comes to you.

07:24.904 --> 07:26.864
He thinks I need protecting.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.744
It's a shame he doesn't know
how strong you are, Skye.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.122
But your home is with me now.

07:34.205 --> 07:35.248
It's...

07:35.540 --> 07:37.375
It's actually Daisy.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.252
My name is Daisy.

07:40.878 --> 07:41.879
Grant knew you as...

07:42.004 --> 07:43.673
Yeah, I changed it.

07:43.756 --> 07:46.384
Or I guess you could say I found it.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.721
It was the name
they always intended for me.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.391
Who?

07:56.686 --> 07:57.895
I got so used to being alone.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.649
And then my dad
made good on his word,

08:01.732 --> 08:03.734
and for a second, I had parents.

08:04.026 --> 08:05.361
Ones who wanted me.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.780
They weren't what I imagined,
but they were real.

08:08.239 --> 08:12.076
Not some fantasy
that I drummed up, you know?

08:12.702 --> 08:14.036
But it didn't end well.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.538
I just...

08:15.955 --> 08:17.748
I don't have parents any more.

08:17.874 --> 08:20.459
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm telling you all this.

08:22.920 --> 08:24.046
Connection.

08:28.259 --> 08:30.970
You and I are one organism now.

08:33.097 --> 08:34.724
<i>Look, this is real world, Coulson.</i>

08:34.807 --> 08:36.142
<i>Malick's intel is actionable.</i>

08:36.392 --> 08:37.894
I have some other matters to attend to.

08:37.977 --> 08:39.687
<i>What could possibly
be more important?</i>

08:39.770 --> 08:41.105
<i>This is HYDRA we're talking about.</i>

08:41.272 --> 08:43.274
<i>You started this, Director.</i>

08:43.399 --> 08:44.650
<i>You need to see it through.</i>

08:44.775 --> 08:46.944
You have all the resources you need.
Update me as you learn more.

08:47.445 --> 08:48.446
<i>Update...</i>

08:54.911 --> 08:55.953
Feel like sharing?

08:56.787 --> 08:58.581
If it becomes a thing, I'll let you know.

08:59.165 --> 09:00.499
You didn't tell him about Daisy.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.792
No, I didn't.

09:05.296 --> 09:08.966
- You think they'll go after Alisha?
- After Lash killed one of her doubles,

09:09.091 --> 09:11.552
I put her in protective housing
to give her time to recover.

09:11.636 --> 09:13.679
Hypothetically, I'm the only one
who knows where she is, but...

09:14.138 --> 09:15.139
Daisy has her ways.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.767
And Alisha's four Inhumans
for the price of one.

09:19.185 --> 09:20.937
We need to get to her before Hive does.

09:21.020 --> 09:25.149
Humans, especially those
with war in their hearts,

09:25.274 --> 09:27.276
presume I want an army.

09:28.027 --> 09:30.655
But there's no need for war
when everyone shares a common goal.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.491
And after we're finished,

09:34.158 --> 09:35.993
there will be no more war.

09:36.452 --> 09:38.287
No more pain.

09:38.788 --> 09:40.206
Especially now that we're together.

09:43.334 --> 09:44.835
It's time we took back this planet.

09:45.336 --> 09:47.838
Make it the home Inhumans
have always deserved.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.229
<i>Under
the communist regime,</i>

10:03.354 --> 10:05.231
public gatherings
were prohibited in Bucharest,

10:05.356 --> 10:07.817
and people were forced to meet
in private homes or secret clubs.

10:07.900 --> 10:12.697
Satellites caught Dr Radcliffe entering
one of those old clubs an hour ago.

10:12.822 --> 10:14.949
We think transhumanists
have turned it into

10:15.032 --> 10:17.535
an upscale black market
for emerging technologies.

10:17.868 --> 10:18.911
Oh, good.

10:19.036 --> 10:22.206
So Simmons and I will pose as top-level
geneticists looking to make a sale.

10:22.373 --> 10:24.959
Okay, but, remember,
this is a high-class establishment,

10:25.042 --> 10:26.419
so you got to dress the part,

10:26.544 --> 10:27.962
which means no lab coats on this one.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.298
Well, do you think scientists
only wear lab coats?

10:30.381 --> 10:31.507
Are we wearing them now?

10:31.590 --> 10:34.010
Yeah. What, we walk around all day
with goggles and gloves on, do we?

10:34.093 --> 10:35.177
I'm sorry.

10:35.261 --> 10:37.388
Well, like you, Radcliffe's
not easy to please.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.890
He has refined tastes
when it comes to human modifications.

10:40.016 --> 10:41.434
Yeah, and he's also a known recluse,

10:41.559 --> 10:44.437
which is why I'm hoping
these little cybernetic bad boys

10:44.562 --> 10:47.189
will pique his interest
enough to get him out of his shell.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.525
They're a variation
of what's inside Deathlok.

10:49.608 --> 10:51.694
That's a different
kind of carrot on a stick.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.863
Innovation's the quickest way
to a scientist's heart.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.656
If we can get him
to appreciate what we do,

10:55.740 --> 10:56.907
hopefully, he'll help us with Daisy.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.951
Yeah, and if that doesn't work,

10:59.076 --> 11:00.578
you can go and beat him up
and drag him out,

11:00.703 --> 11:02.079
'cause all you are is big and strong.
Hmm?

11:04.081 --> 11:05.124
Okay.

11:05.249 --> 11:07.251
Okay, I'll never say another word
about the lab coats again.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.920
All right,
this room is our rendezvous point.

11:10.046 --> 11:11.172
If we get Radcliffe...

11:11.255 --> 11:12.340
We bring him back here.

11:12.423 --> 11:14.050
- And if something goes wrong...
- We meet here.

11:14.133 --> 11:15.217
Good.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.888
'Cause I'm not ready
to lose another teammate today.

11:19.972 --> 11:21.307
Lincoln, what are you doing?

11:21.640 --> 11:23.434
Alisha and I are friends. She trusts me.

11:23.601 --> 11:26.812
- Hive can infect you. You can't come.
- I won't let him get to me.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.981
You think you have a say in that?
You think Daisy did?

11:29.106 --> 11:30.483
He's coming.

11:31.108 --> 11:32.234
With one caveat.

11:32.735 --> 11:34.737
You want in, you wear this.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.698
It's lined with nano-thermites.

11:37.782 --> 11:39.325
Nano-what?

11:39.450 --> 11:40.993
They're miniscule explosives.

11:41.786 --> 11:43.412
You want me to wear a suicide vest?

11:43.496 --> 11:44.622
It's only if Hive infects you.

11:45.289 --> 11:48.250
And technically,
a suicide vest is something you control.

11:49.126 --> 11:50.336
So it's a murder vest.

11:51.087 --> 11:52.296
This watch is the trigger.

11:52.838 --> 11:53.923
Phil.

11:54.298 --> 11:55.466
If Hive gets its hands on him...

11:55.591 --> 11:56.842
I go kaboom?

11:57.134 --> 11:58.928
That'd make you both real happy,
wouldn't it?

11:59.804 --> 12:01.138
Then you'd get Daisy back,

12:01.263 --> 12:03.682
and the three of you can live
as one small, messed-up family again?

12:03.808 --> 12:05.309
- It's a last resort.
- It's insane.

12:07.019 --> 12:08.104
I want your help.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.855
I need it.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.774
But if Hive sways you, that's it.

12:12.149 --> 12:14.110
No one's gonna force you to do
anything you don't want to do.

12:14.193 --> 12:16.695
That's the whole point.
But if you want in the field,

12:16.821 --> 12:19.323
then this is a risk
you've got to be willing to take.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.798
What is it?

12:35.881 --> 12:37.007
Do I look weird?

12:37.133 --> 12:38.217
I feel a bit weird
all dressed up like this.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.010
No.

12:40.678 --> 12:43.180
You look nice. That's all.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.475
Mack, do you have a visual?

12:47.143 --> 12:48.185
Affirmative.

12:48.811 --> 12:49.854
I see what you see.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.524
<i>Turn on multi-spectral imaging.</i>

12:53.858 --> 12:54.900
All right.

12:59.405 --> 13:01.866
I don't know what I expected, but...

13:02.324 --> 13:04.493
This is not what I expected.

13:04.994 --> 13:06.579
Let's just say
most of the people in this room

13:06.704 --> 13:07.997
are more than what they seem.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.207
<i>You two stay alert.</i>

13:10.332 --> 13:12.209
<i>I'm not sure what you're walking into.</i>

13:22.219 --> 13:23.762
Looks clear from out here.

13:23.888 --> 13:25.139
<i>Lincoln?</i>

13:25.222 --> 13:26.807
<i>I'm in position by Alisha's car.</i>

13:26.891 --> 13:28.142
You take the stairwell.
I'll follow you in...

13:28.225 --> 13:30.227
What happens if they show up?

13:31.729 --> 13:33.606
We neutralise Hive and extricate Daisy.

13:34.023 --> 13:35.399
It's that simple, huh?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.568
We'll figure it out. We always do.

13:38.527 --> 13:40.529
And if Daisy won't come quietly?

13:41.030 --> 13:42.072
What are you getting at?

13:43.908 --> 13:46.076
This is a potentially volatile situation,

13:46.410 --> 13:48.787
and I need to know
what you expect from me.

13:49.747 --> 13:51.415
You're always so quick to the trigger,
you know that?

13:51.957 --> 13:53.000
Excuse me?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.711
If you're asking whether
you shoot Daisy, the answer's no.

13:55.794 --> 13:56.921
Daisy is not Andrew.

13:59.215 --> 14:02.343
I pull the trigger
because you order me to.

14:02.426 --> 14:03.469
You're the Director.

14:03.594 --> 14:06.430
I didn't ask for the kill switch
to Lincoln's vest. You gave it to me.

14:06.555 --> 14:09.308
Because somehow,
sacrificing him is okay with you.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.477
- That's not what I meant.
- I'll do your dirty work, Phil,

14:11.602 --> 14:13.938
but don't you dare pretend
your hands are clean.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.619
Lincoln?

14:29.662 --> 14:30.788
How'd you know where I was?

14:30.913 --> 14:32.289
Have you seen Daisy recently?

14:33.082 --> 14:34.667
No. Why?

14:35.793 --> 14:37.127
I thought they'd come for you.

14:41.131 --> 14:42.174
How you been, James?

14:42.299 --> 14:44.426
You know, just catching up on my soaps.

14:44.802 --> 14:46.470
What brings you out here
to the middle of nowhere?

14:46.762 --> 14:49.306
Did you break things up with blondie?
You're looking for a lap to cry on?

14:49.431 --> 14:50.599
Are you drunk?

14:50.683 --> 14:52.351
Well, I'm Australian, so...

14:52.476 --> 14:53.936
Yes.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.397
Ugh.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.982
Who's Aladdin?

14:58.107 --> 15:01.151
This is actually the ancient Inhuman
you were telling me about.

15:01.819 --> 15:02.987
Thought you two should meet.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.656
<i>He looks like Grant Ward,
but he is most definitely</i>

15:05.781 --> 15:07.825
not Grant Ward.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.368
I know it sounds crazy,

15:09.493 --> 15:11.161
but he controls Inhumans,

15:11.287 --> 15:13.455
forces us to do things
we wouldn't otherwise do.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.165
I can keep you safe, but...

15:22.339 --> 15:24.174
You're not the first one
we've paid a visit to.

15:25.217 --> 15:27.845
But don't worry.
I didn't forget about you.

15:28.679 --> 15:29.888
Hey, flower,

15:30.389 --> 15:32.975
I get that you're attracted to danger.
I know the type.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.185
But if Jiaying feared this guy,

15:35.394 --> 15:36.562
it was probably for a reason.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.064
James.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.069
Daisy showed me
the Kree artefact you gave to her,

15:44.194 --> 15:46.238
and it's missing its companion piece.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.617
But you already knew that.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.494
What? No, no, no, no.
I gave this chickadee everything.

15:52.578 --> 15:53.662
I swear on my nana's life.

15:53.746 --> 15:55.748
I'm not the type to sell you
some bill of goods.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.334
I mean, that reminds me of a story
that I think you'll particularly dig,

15:58.417 --> 15:59.585
'cause it's absolutely...

16:04.089 --> 16:05.215
You talk too much.

16:16.435 --> 16:18.062
We don't want to have to hurt you.

16:19.063 --> 16:20.606
We want you to join us.

16:20.731 --> 16:22.441
Hang tight, Lincoln. I'm almost there.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.902
- Coulson.
- On my way.

16:27.905 --> 16:30.324
There's no reason for you
to stay loyal to humans.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.409
They're a lesser species.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.495
Lesser species, my ass!

17:01.105 --> 17:02.106
Where's the original?

17:03.107 --> 17:04.441
We can find her and...

17:06.859 --> 17:07.903
Stop!

17:08.945 --> 17:10.446
Gun down!

17:11.240 --> 17:12.281
Now!

17:13.282 --> 17:14.367
Don't.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.618
Where's Daisy?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.623
Tell me now, or I swear to God,
I'll make her suffer!

17:20.124 --> 17:21.208
We can't.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.459
Hive won't let us.

17:22.584 --> 17:23.961
I just need to get her back.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.378
Whatever it takes.

17:31.719 --> 17:33.095
No. No.

17:33.429 --> 17:34.471
Oh, my God.

17:35.264 --> 17:36.306
Why would you...

17:36.890 --> 17:37.933
You made us.

17:39.226 --> 17:40.394
No!

17:48.444 --> 17:50.154
I lost them.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.822
I lost them.

17:53.449 --> 17:54.491
S.H.I.E.L.D. came looking?

17:56.160 --> 17:57.911
Is Lincoln alive?

18:00.330 --> 18:01.623
Good.

18:04.585 --> 18:05.794
And how do you feel?

18:07.004 --> 18:08.756
Happy to make the sacrifice.

18:10.007 --> 18:11.133
Now rest up.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.010
We need your strength.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.183
James is breaking out of his husk,

18:19.349 --> 18:20.684
like, in a really aggressive way.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.194
No!

18:30.277 --> 18:31.361
What's happening?

18:31.695 --> 18:34.156
My insides, they're on fire!

18:38.160 --> 18:39.787
Oh, crap. I didn't... I didn't mean to...

18:39.995 --> 18:41.038
Ah!

18:43.540 --> 18:45.793
Guess you won't be needing
all that C-4 any more.

18:45.876 --> 18:46.877
My hands!

18:47.002 --> 18:48.170
Everything I touch...

18:59.389 --> 19:00.516
Thank you.

19:01.225 --> 19:02.226
Now,

19:03.227 --> 19:05.479
we can't leave here
until you give us the missing...

19:05.562 --> 19:07.189
I buried it.

19:22.871 --> 19:24.665
So, what is it?

19:26.416 --> 19:28.585
The only thing that can destroy me.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.380
<i>Well, that's a rather
ominous thing to say.</i>

19:31.755 --> 19:33.215
It's true.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.342
These guys keep staring at us.

19:35.425 --> 19:37.427
Or maybe they're staring at the case.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.848
Well, they could work for Dr Radcliffe,
presuming he's even here.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.266
We've looked everywhere.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.936
There's only one way to find out.

19:49.731 --> 19:50.899
Excuse me.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.901
Looking for Dr Holden Radcliffe.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.403
We're scientists.

19:54.778 --> 19:56.446
Hello.

19:56.530 --> 19:58.031
My name is Anon.

19:58.115 --> 20:00.117
Do you have an appointment
with the doctor?

20:00.742 --> 20:02.119
Not exactly.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.288
We're fellow geneticists.

20:04.538 --> 20:08.458
Like Dr Radcliffe,
we dabble in human enhancements.

20:08.542 --> 20:11.712
<i>Guys, this woman has been
heavily modified,</i>

20:11.795 --> 20:13.630
in ways you wouldn't anticipate.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.466
Man, I need to get out more.

20:16.592 --> 20:18.468
Are you a patient of Dr Radcliffe?

20:19.219 --> 20:22.973
We have quite innovative
eye technology.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.434
Perhaps it will serve you, as well.

20:26.310 --> 20:27.936
I can take it to the doctor.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.397
Respectfully, it's for Dr Radcliffe.

20:31.148 --> 20:32.482
Or no one at all.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.325
Wait in the bar area.

20:41.408 --> 20:44.995
If the doctor expresses interest,
I will find you.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.503
<i>Doesn't make any sense.</i>

20:53.837 --> 20:57.007
Alisha never would've killed herself.
She feels all of it.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.134
Every death.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.428
It's Hive.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.472
That thing forced her.

21:04.264 --> 21:05.265
We've got to stop it.

21:05.349 --> 21:07.684
I'm taking you out of the field
until Fitz-Simmons find a cure.

21:07.976 --> 21:09.519
What? No.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.023
Look, I know I went overboard today,

21:13.523 --> 21:15.025
and I'm sorry.

21:15.108 --> 21:17.694
Without Daisy, I...

21:17.945 --> 21:19.696
I'll do better. Please.

21:19.863 --> 21:21.198
She'd want me to keep you safe.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.783
You can't do this.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.534
I just did.

21:36.546 --> 21:38.298
You're sitting in here for the view?

21:38.799 --> 21:40.300
You haven't given me a destination.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.886
That's 'cause I don't have one.

21:46.056 --> 21:47.057
How you holding up?

21:47.891 --> 21:49.518
Just another day at the office.

21:51.395 --> 21:53.897
I'm sorry about earlier.
I was out of line.

21:54.982 --> 21:56.984
I'm frustrated with the...

21:58.151 --> 21:59.194
We all are.

22:00.487 --> 22:02.489
You're not the only one who cares.

22:02.572 --> 22:04.241
I know. And you're right.

22:05.659 --> 22:07.202
The things I expect of you...

22:07.744 --> 22:09.246
On some level, I'm no better than Hive.

22:10.580 --> 22:12.916
No one forces me to do anything.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.168
I took advantage.

22:17.504 --> 22:20.424
When it comes to Daisy, she's young.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.426
I forget that sometimes.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.261
And from what Fitz-Simmons have said,

22:24.386 --> 22:27.764
Hive's infections only heightens
feelings she already has.

22:28.890 --> 22:30.851
Daisy's always longed for a family,

22:30.934 --> 22:32.853
for connection.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.938
I thought I could give it to her
with S.H.I.E.L.D.

22:37.858 --> 22:39.276
Phil...

22:41.862 --> 22:43.405
You're not her father.

22:44.573 --> 22:46.283
No.

22:46.408 --> 22:48.452
But she's the closest thing
I have to a daughter.

22:49.619 --> 22:50.704
Sir?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.708
You told me to monitor any unusual
seismic activity.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.792
- We found...
- Where?

22:55.917 --> 22:56.960
South Dakota.

22:58.211 --> 22:59.629
They're after the potential Inhuman.

23:11.808 --> 23:14.603
Mack, are you getting
feedback on comms?

23:16.063 --> 23:18.315
Simmons, you hear that?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.984
Oh, yeah, it's terribly loud.

23:21.151 --> 23:24.321
- Probably best if we go offline to reboot.
<i>- Looks fine on my end.</i>

23:24.404 --> 23:25.489
Back in a jiff.

23:28.575 --> 23:31.995
Got a long history
of unfinished conversations, so...

23:32.120 --> 23:33.246
I thought it was about time that...

23:33.330 --> 23:34.790
We finish one.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.126
So, um,

23:39.002 --> 23:40.337
I've been thinking about it...

23:40.420 --> 23:42.923
About us and, um...

23:44.091 --> 23:45.133
It clicked.

23:48.762 --> 23:52.349
The crux of our relationship is like
the singularity in transhumanism.

23:52.849 --> 23:54.476
- It is?
- Yeah, think about it.

23:54.810 --> 23:57.771
Singularity is the defining moment.

23:57.854 --> 24:00.440
The point at which a measurable
variable becomes infinite.

24:00.524 --> 24:04.152
Right. So, our friendship is

24:04.486 --> 24:06.029
linear.

24:06.154 --> 24:09.282
It's simple, comfortable.

24:09.366 --> 24:10.951
Effortless, really.

24:11.034 --> 24:13.453
As soon as we deviate from that path...

24:13.703 --> 24:15.455
Change becomes exponential.

24:15.539 --> 24:16.873
The point of no return.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.461
Just to be clear.

24:22.546 --> 24:26.550
Are you comparing us sleeping together
to crossing the event horizon?

24:28.885 --> 24:29.970
Yeah.

24:30.887 --> 24:33.640
It's quite lovely
when you think about it like that.

24:34.391 --> 24:35.517
And also terrifying.

24:35.976 --> 24:37.394
Yeah, exactly.

24:38.228 --> 24:39.729
So...

24:42.983 --> 24:44.359
We should stop thinking altogether...

24:44.526 --> 24:46.153
And just do.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.405
Yeah. Of course.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.323
Hello.

24:50.991 --> 24:52.200
Please follow me.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.499
Back online and on the move.

24:59.583 --> 25:00.584
<i>Copy that.</i>

25:11.094 --> 25:12.721
This wasn't in the schematics.

25:18.935 --> 25:20.061
You first.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.276
Are we meeting Dr Radcliffe?

25:43.251 --> 25:44.419
After you.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.274
I'm not sure we understand.

26:06.983 --> 26:10.278
You are looking to sell the doctor
eye technology, are you not?

26:11.321 --> 26:12.447
Yes, but...

26:12.906 --> 26:15.992
The doctor will meet you
once I've seen the surgery is complete

26:16.117 --> 26:18.662
and your cybernetic eye is in place.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.080
Surgery.

26:20.163 --> 26:22.249
You want us to remove...

26:22.332 --> 26:23.416
And replace it with...

26:23.500 --> 26:27.504
Dr Radcliffe needs assurance that your
technology meets his standards.

26:28.338 --> 26:29.673
The only way to do this

26:29.798 --> 26:32.926
is to test it on a live human specimen.

26:35.178 --> 26:36.429
Whenever you're ready.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.483
Uh, can you give us a minute to prep?

26:52.529 --> 26:54.614
This seems extremely unethical.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.950
We've done far more questionable
things for our employer.

26:58.368 --> 27:00.620
A third opinion would be welcome.

27:01.121 --> 27:03.164
Well, if Radcliffe's our only way
to cure Tremors,

27:03.707 --> 27:04.791
you know where I stand.

27:06.876 --> 27:08.336
<i>Then it's decided.</i>

27:10.880 --> 27:12.173
All right, sir,

27:12.299 --> 27:15.635
I'm just going to need to numb the area
before we begin.

27:22.392 --> 27:23.393
Okay.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.354
You might feel a slight pinch.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.196
Jemma.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.752
What kind of a sick game is this?

27:48.877 --> 27:50.003
Simmons, what's going on?

27:50.086 --> 27:51.087
It's a prosthetic.

27:51.212 --> 27:53.006
Well, you certainly weren't afraid
you were wrong.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.592
What tipped it?

27:56.384 --> 27:58.762
That your eye's not entirely human.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.513
What?

28:00.597 --> 28:03.933
Mammals don't have ciliary muscles
in their vascular layer,

28:04.017 --> 28:07.520
but that eye does, so what is it?
Some kind of avian hybrid?

28:07.604 --> 28:08.688
Why would... Why would you...

28:08.772 --> 28:11.191
Birds' visual acuity
is superior to mammals.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.027
I was envious.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.196
But I don't... Why all the...

28:16.279 --> 28:17.864
Smoke and mirrors?

28:17.947 --> 28:19.115
It's a fair question.

28:19.240 --> 28:23.453
To put it simply,
I'm selective about who I work with.

28:23.536 --> 28:27.040
I believe that art and science
are entwined.

28:27.582 --> 28:30.627
The devil, and God, is in the details.

28:30.794 --> 28:33.296
I don't want people to see my work
and know it's work.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.634
If they give a second glance,
I want it to be out of awe, not disgust.

28:39.135 --> 28:40.595
May I?

28:50.146 --> 28:51.648
You really are a stubborn bastard.

28:51.815 --> 28:53.316
That's why
we get on so well.

28:54.275 --> 28:57.070
I'm telling you, it's fine.
It doesn't even hurt.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.495
Check the perimeter.

29:06.329 --> 29:07.914
I'll take point.

29:27.600 --> 29:28.977
They've unearthed something.

29:29.185 --> 29:31.604
I can see how its
surveillance capabilities are appealing.

29:34.190 --> 29:37.444
But there was a company
that had something eerily similar.

29:38.695 --> 29:40.780
Cybertek. Heard of them?

29:41.823 --> 29:42.949
Turns out they were HYDRA.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.367
We're not HYDRA, I assure you.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.786
They connected explosives
to soldiers' eyes.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.539
Violence for violence's sake,
an ugly misuse of science.

29:49.664 --> 29:52.041
- We're S.H.I.E.L.D.
- Same thing.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.294
No. That's a common mistake, actually.

29:54.377 --> 29:56.296
- Mack.
- You're on comms with someone.

30:12.187 --> 30:13.229
Please stop.

30:13.354 --> 30:14.898
Listen, we know about
the research you were conducting.

30:14.981 --> 30:17.984
You were genetically engineering
animals that can resist parasites,

30:18.067 --> 30:19.736
which is quite appropriate,
really, because...

30:19.861 --> 30:21.404
Well, there's a man-eating parasite
on the loose.

30:21.488 --> 30:24.157
It can inhabit dead humans
and control Inhumans.

30:24.240 --> 30:26.409
- It can force...
- Inhumans? They're real?

30:27.368 --> 30:29.162
Take them. They're not welcome here.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.663
- Stop. Please.
- No, hold on. Hold on.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.582
- Dr Radcliffe!
- Jemma!

30:32.707 --> 30:33.917
I'll meet you at the rendezvous point!

30:34.042 --> 30:35.084
Fitz! Ah!

30:39.172 --> 30:40.715
You have to hear me out.

30:45.595 --> 30:47.180
We're chasing
our own damn tail.

30:48.598 --> 30:50.266
Coulson.

30:53.603 --> 30:55.438
Clear the area.
This place is rigged to blow.

30:55.605 --> 30:56.773
- We got to get out of here.
- There's no time.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.024
Then get in.

31:17.252 --> 31:18.294
When did you...

31:18.419 --> 31:20.964
I thought it would be cool if the Director
of S.H.I.E.L.D. had a shield.

31:21.089 --> 31:23.299
- Fitz agreed, so...
- Handy.

31:24.384 --> 31:26.135
Okay. The leg hurts a little.

31:26.302 --> 31:28.221
Maybe you should get a cybernetic one.

31:28.555 --> 31:29.639
Too soon.

31:32.767 --> 31:33.810
You gonna get that?

31:36.604 --> 31:37.647
- <i>Coulson!</i>
- Talbot?

31:37.730 --> 31:38.898
This isn't a good time.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.441
<i>You have to listen to me.</i>

31:40.608 --> 31:42.151
Yes, Inhumans are real.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.988
But that's barely scratching the surface,
'cause I've stood on alien soil,

31:45.113 --> 31:46.823
and I've jumped through
a portal to get there.

31:46.990 --> 31:49.075
So if it's discovery that you want
and the science behind it...

31:49.158 --> 31:50.660
It's both. It's all of it.

31:50.785 --> 31:51.911
Okay, well, I can give you that.

31:51.995 --> 31:53.830
But first I need your help.

31:54.163 --> 31:55.790
Okay? 'Cause...

31:56.916 --> 31:58.334
You're the only one
that can save my friend.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.763
Stop! I'm...
I'm not going anywhere without Fitz!

32:13.349 --> 32:15.310
You once said the same thing about me.

32:20.023 --> 32:21.190
Ooh.

32:29.532 --> 32:30.533
Hey.

32:33.369 --> 32:34.537
I just wanted a little sip.

32:34.662 --> 32:37.290
I didn't know you were
an officer of the law.

32:37.373 --> 32:39.876
You think you're some kind of
designer humans, huh?

32:39.959 --> 32:41.711
But you're just playing dress-up.

32:42.545 --> 32:43.671
You'll never be able to do it.

32:45.506 --> 32:46.549
Well...

32:50.637 --> 32:53.306
What? He started it.

32:58.394 --> 32:59.479
Stop!

32:59.562 --> 33:01.230
You're that Inhuman.

33:01.314 --> 33:02.899
Where's Daisy?

33:03.566 --> 33:06.069
That bird has so many male suitors.

33:07.862 --> 33:09.238
And what are your muscles made out of?

33:10.031 --> 33:11.324
Me?

33:17.163 --> 33:18.206
Anon.

33:20.833 --> 33:23.753
- Take him.
- No. Wait.

33:29.342 --> 33:30.510
We need to talk.

33:30.593 --> 33:32.762
Stay the hell away from me.
If you try to hurt me, I swear...

33:32.845 --> 33:34.263
Yeah, I'm doom.

33:35.598 --> 33:37.433
You're hope. Remember?

33:40.728 --> 33:41.771
Will?

33:42.438 --> 33:43.523
No, it's not...

33:45.274 --> 33:46.401
It's not possible.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.445
Never been able to resist
doing something

33:51.447 --> 33:52.782
when the odds are impossible.

33:59.247 --> 34:01.708
Now, I want your honest opinion on this.

34:01.791 --> 34:04.043
What do you think
of the name "Inferno"?

34:04.127 --> 34:06.462
I like it, but I don't love it.

34:06.587 --> 34:09.297
Firestarter? Well, feels a little '90s.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.134
And Burning Man...
I mean, that would've been perfect

34:11.217 --> 34:13.928
if it wasn't for some
bloody desert hippy fest.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.097
How about Blowhard?

34:19.141 --> 34:20.143
<i>I don't have much time.</i>

34:22.978 --> 34:25.606
This isn't you. We can...

34:27.900 --> 34:30.277
- What are you...
- Stop trying to save me.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.072
Daisy...

34:35.074 --> 34:36.492
I know what I'm saying.

34:37.409 --> 34:38.828
I know what I feel.

34:40.329 --> 34:42.998
I finally have a family, Fitz.
You don't need to pity me any more.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.168
It happened so quickly.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.753
The storm,

34:47.128 --> 34:48.588
the portal opening.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.132
I guess you were right about Fitz, huh?

34:53.467 --> 34:54.635
Stop it.

34:54.844 --> 34:57.764
Jemma, listen.

34:58.431 --> 35:00.266
I'm glad you made it back to him.

35:00.808 --> 35:02.643
All I want is for you to be happy.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.312
Safe.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.522
That's why I'm glad we're here now.

35:07.690 --> 35:09.192
I never got a chance to say good-bye.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.694
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you, I swear,

35:11.778 --> 35:13.279
but you and Simmons...

35:13.362 --> 35:15.198
Well, I've seen the future,

35:15.281 --> 35:17.200
and someone in S.H.I.E.L.D.
is gonna die.

35:18.201 --> 35:20.787
And if you love her,
you will leave us alone.

35:20.870 --> 35:22.830
I'm the only thing protecting you.

35:23.206 --> 35:25.124
No, that's not...

35:25.208 --> 35:27.043
He said you'd do anything to fool me.

35:27.543 --> 35:29.504
Jemma, please.

35:30.463 --> 35:31.672
I wouldn't trick you.

35:32.381 --> 35:34.217
I don't want you to end up dead like me.

35:37.178 --> 35:40.681
We don't want that to happen to you.

35:43.684 --> 35:45.561
It's in your best interest...

35:45.686 --> 35:47.063
...to stay away.

35:47.522 --> 35:50.233
We don't want to hurt you, any of you.

35:51.984 --> 35:53.319
But we will.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.657
This is your last warning.

35:58.991 --> 36:01.410
Next time, I snap your neck.

36:22.348 --> 36:24.100
It's time to let me go.

36:26.602 --> 36:30.731
Just because you stole Will's memories,

36:31.107 --> 36:34.068
it doesn't give you the right to be him.

36:36.279 --> 36:37.864
Will is dead.

36:56.465 --> 36:58.968
HQ is fortified.
Nothing's getting in here.

37:01.804 --> 37:03.055
It's a thing.

37:03.139 --> 37:05.641
This is why Talbot's
been so bent out of shape.

37:05.725 --> 37:08.311
- Malick's intel?
- He gave us everything.

37:08.436 --> 37:10.313
You mess with a man's family,
all bets are off.

37:10.897 --> 37:12.148
I don't think aliens get that.

37:13.399 --> 37:14.442
What are you saying?

37:15.818 --> 37:18.446
We're about to take down
HYDRA's infrastructure.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.156
Want to watch?

37:20.239 --> 37:21.949
<i>All units in position, Director.</i>

37:22.074 --> 37:23.451
<i>Two mikes to launch.</i>

37:23.576 --> 37:25.661
Roger that. HQ has visual.

37:25.828 --> 37:27.246
<i>All stations report.</i>

37:27.330 --> 37:28.664
<i>Echo 1,
on your order.</i>

37:28.748 --> 37:30.333
<i>Red 6,
prepping to breach.</i>

37:30.458 --> 37:32.251
<i>QJ-4, locked in and ready.</i>

37:32.335 --> 37:33.586
<i>All operations a go.</i>

37:33.669 --> 37:35.171
<i>Commence DECAP.</i>

37:44.680 --> 37:45.848
Oh, thank God.

37:45.973 --> 37:47.600
- Is Fitz with you?
- No.

37:47.683 --> 37:49.018
But this is the rendezvous point.

37:49.143 --> 37:51.771
Wait. Hold on, hold on. I just got back.
He can't be too far behind.

37:52.521 --> 37:54.857
Plus, if you go out there looking for him
and he comes back here,

37:54.982 --> 37:56.692
then this will go on all night.

38:02.782 --> 38:03.824
You okay?

38:06.369 --> 38:07.662
You see Daisy?

38:12.208 --> 38:14.627
Hive,

38:14.710 --> 38:17.171
or whatever it is.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.548
I shot him.

38:21.217 --> 38:22.635
Doubt it did anything.

38:22.969 --> 38:24.845
Always said I'd shoot Ward.

38:28.516 --> 38:29.976
You think we'll get her back?

38:30.059 --> 38:31.352
We have to.

38:34.897 --> 38:37.817
I guess sometimes it's easier to think
the world wants you to suffer

38:37.900 --> 38:40.736
than to believe it's got your back.

38:41.737 --> 38:42.863
You should tell that to Fitz.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.324
He thinks we're cursed,

38:45.408 --> 38:48.661
which I know is ridiculous, but...

38:48.744 --> 38:50.162
I don't know.

38:52.707 --> 38:54.333
So, how long have you two...

38:55.543 --> 38:57.837
Oh, no. No, we've...

38:58.212 --> 38:59.338
It's not...

38:59.422 --> 39:01.048
You know how many times
Bobbi and Hunter pulled

39:01.173 --> 39:02.883
the "my comms are broken" trick?

39:05.177 --> 39:06.512
Come on.

39:06.846 --> 39:09.890
Right. Well, I don't know.

39:11.726 --> 39:13.519
I suppose it's very new.

39:16.772 --> 39:17.898
No, it isn't.

39:29.452 --> 39:31.704
<i>All stations, targets secure.</i>

39:31.787 --> 39:33.622
<i>The head has been cut.</i>

39:33.706 --> 39:35.458
<i>I repeat, the head has been cut.</i>

39:35.583 --> 39:37.043
<i>HYDRA has been eliminated.</i>

39:38.127 --> 39:40.212
Just like that.

39:40.296 --> 39:41.922
Just like that.

39:44.925 --> 39:46.969
This should've been a great day.

39:53.642 --> 39:54.727
Jemma?

39:56.395 --> 39:57.438
Where have you been?

39:59.607 --> 40:00.816
Looking for you.

40:00.941 --> 40:03.778
Oh, well, I've been here at
the rendezvous point like we discussed.

40:03.944 --> 40:06.238
- What? And Mack?
- In the Quinjet, unloading equipment.

40:09.325 --> 40:12.661
Well, we've got a lot to talk about.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.517
Jemma.

40:35.476 --> 40:36.519
Yeah?

40:38.020 --> 40:39.688
Your hands are freezing.

40:42.358 --> 40:43.609
Are they?

40:47.196 --> 40:48.864
They're like little ice buckets,
aren't they?

40:53.869 --> 40:55.538
Do you think you can brave it?

40:56.664 --> 40:58.707
I'll do my best to power through.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.474
All right, then what about "Hellfire"?

41:16.642 --> 41:19.562
It's better than "Scorch,"
but I'm worried it's too much.

41:19.645 --> 41:21.063
You're a difficult man
to find, Doctor.

41:21.981 --> 41:24.650
You're Inhuman, all of you.

41:24.733 --> 41:25.985
Well, technically,

41:26.068 --> 41:28.737
I'm one of the first genetically altered
human beings on the planet.

41:29.655 --> 41:32.658
Scientifically, humans have advanced
almost to the level The Kree reached

41:32.741 --> 41:34.660
when they made me.

41:34.743 --> 41:36.912
You, Doctor, seem to be the closest.

41:38.038 --> 41:39.415
Very flattering, and I agree.

41:39.748 --> 41:41.167
But genome editing,

41:41.250 --> 41:44.003
we've only just begun
that kind of DNA modification.

41:44.086 --> 41:46.005
To make something of your kind, that's...

41:47.673 --> 41:50.384
We can only dream.

41:51.010 --> 41:53.262
You don't need to dream any more.

41:54.597 --> 41:57.266
We are one organism, seeking change.

41:58.100 --> 42:00.561
And with your help,
we're going to redefine humanity.

42:01.353 --> 42:02.771
Permanently.

42:03.022 --> 42:05.274
Is that even possible? How could you...

42:05.357 --> 42:08.277
By re-creating the same
Kree experiment that was done to me.

42:11.113 --> 42:12.907
And this is where it all begins.

42:15.367 --> 42:16.702
Bought us a house?

42:16.785 --> 42:18.078
No.

42:18.954 --> 42:20.289
I bought us a whole town.
