[Voiceover]
Previously on "Nashville..."

00:01.462 --> 00:02.713
- This is Randall St. Clair.

00:02.713 --> 00:04.335
He'll be
our new social media

00:04.335 --> 00:05.886
and digital marketing man.

00:05.886 --> 00:07.428
- Ms. Jaymes,
I'm your biggest fan.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.892
- You sold it to Google
for $2 billion?

00:11.892 --> 00:13.184
- Zach Welles.
- Hi.

00:13.184 --> 00:14.595
- I had the idiotic notion

00:14.595 --> 00:15.896
that I could do something
in the music business.

00:15.896 --> 00:17.098
I was hoping
we could meet up.

00:17.098 --> 00:18.769
- We got to look
for a place together.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.941
- The keep telling you
to be patient.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.943
- I'm sick of being patient.

00:22.943 --> 00:25.106
I'm never gonna get better.
- Don't say that.

00:25.106 --> 00:28.739
- She just peed on my legs,
and I felt it.

00:30.611 --> 00:34.115
- (groans)

00:36.207 --> 00:39.710
You can go further.
I can take it. Aah!

00:39.710 --> 00:42.503
- Okay.
(baby fusses)

00:42.503 --> 00:44.625
- It's okay, baby.
Mama's all right.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.217
-I got her.
Come here, baby girl.

00:46.217 --> 00:47.428
- Did you remember
to take your oxycodone

00:47.428 --> 00:48.669
before we started
this morning?

00:51.132 --> 00:53.804
- Oh, right.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.846
- We can't do our best work

00:55.846 --> 00:56.937
if you're in too much pain.

00:56.937 --> 00:59.770
- I'm not. I swear.

00:59.770 --> 01:03.444
I think I could do something
even more advanced.

01:03.444 --> 01:04.645
- Maybe next session.

01:04.645 --> 01:08.899
- I just feel like
I'm lying here

01:08.899 --> 01:10.991
all the time like a lump.
- I know it's frustrating.

01:10.991 --> 01:13.994
But you got to crawl
before you can walk.

01:13.994 --> 01:16.117
Not literally.
- Good.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.998
- You just
regained sensation.

01:17.998 --> 01:19.460
You can't put any weight
on this

01:19.460 --> 01:20.871
until the fixator comes off.

01:20.871 --> 01:23.414
- Okay, but I saw
something online.

01:23.414 --> 01:27.878
There's a device
that they put people in

01:27.878 --> 01:30.421
where they can walk without
gravity or something like that?

01:30.421 --> 01:32.423
- It's not exactly
without gravity.

01:32.423 --> 01:35.556
You're thinking of a device
that redistributes weight.

01:35.556 --> 01:37.558
- I don't care!
Just get me in one!

01:39.059 --> 01:44.064
I mean,
I would appreciate

01:44.064 --> 01:47.278
if I could try it out.

01:47.278 --> 01:49.650
- The clinic does have one,
but it's really for patients

01:49.650 --> 01:51.071
who are further along
in their recovery.

01:51.071 --> 01:53.734
- How much further along?

01:53.734 --> 01:55.406
- Let's just focus on
where you're at right now.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.117
- Yeah.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.953
- I think I found it.
- Huh?

02:02.953 --> 02:04.665
- I just came from
a place on Greenwood.

02:04.665 --> 02:06.126
It's gorgeous in person.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.340
- Is that the one
with the gym?

02:09.340 --> 02:11.302
- No, that's the big complex
near Hadley Park.

02:11.302 --> 02:13.594
But we crossed that
off the list.

02:13.594 --> 02:16.136
I thought we agreed we didn't
want to be that far west.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.808
- Oh, right.

02:17.808 --> 02:19.139
- You're gonna love it.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.061
I made an appointment
to go back on Friday.

02:21.061 --> 02:23.604
Hey, don't go back to sleep.
- (groans)

02:23.604 --> 02:25.065
- What, were you up partying
all night?

02:25.065 --> 02:28.689
- No. I had a gig.

02:28.689 --> 02:32.233
- Well,
why didn't you tell me?

02:32.233 --> 02:35.115
- You don't have to come
to every show I play.

02:35.115 --> 02:36.487
- What if I want to?

02:36.487 --> 02:38.199
- You hate those loud clubs.

02:38.199 --> 02:42.453
- I don't hate them.
I just don't like them.

02:42.453 --> 02:44.285
- I figured it'd be better

02:44.285 --> 02:47.628
if we spend time
doing things we both enjoy.

02:47.628 --> 02:49.920
- Like what?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.342
(knock on door)

02:51.342 --> 02:53.634
- Hey, Will,
you seen my keys?

02:53.634 --> 02:55.256
- No!

02:57.428 --> 02:59.850
- I can't wait for you
to get out of here.

03:03.894 --> 03:06.897
♪ Maybe I'll move
to California ♪

03:06.897 --> 03:11.232
♪ With the unbroken part of
my heart I still have left ♪

03:11.232 --> 03:14.615
♪ Maybe I'll fall in love
again someday ♪

03:14.615 --> 03:18.949

hold my breath ♪

03:18.949 --> 03:22.453

03:22.453 --> 03:23.784

03:23.784 --> 03:25.165
- See, that's just
so beautiful.

03:25.165 --> 03:27.668
- I know. We can't
afford her, though.

03:27.668 --> 03:29.290
- I know. We can't afford

03:29.290 --> 03:31.712
the first 10 directors
on our list.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.883
Hey, Randall?

03:32.883 --> 03:34.965
- Yes?
- Hey, I just wanted to say

03:34.965 --> 03:37.097
I love what you did
with the Exes' site,

03:37.097 --> 03:39.550
all the graphics and everything
on the new single.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.221
It's so cool.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.514
- Oh, my gosh.
Thank you.

03:43.514 --> 03:45.686
- Yeah.
Keep up the good work.

03:45.686 --> 03:49.149
- Absolutely. I will.

03:49.149 --> 03:51.812
- He just seems
terrified of me.

03:51.812 --> 03:54.525
- I think he's just
eager to please.

03:54.525 --> 03:56.567
- Oh, I don't know.
I can't watch these anymore.

03:56.567 --> 03:57.818
It's too depressing.

03:57.818 --> 03:59.530
- I mean,
what do you want to do?

03:59.530 --> 04:01.071
You want to tell Scarlett
and Gunnar we can't do a video?

04:01.071 --> 04:03.364
- No. I mean,
I think we keep looking.

04:03.364 --> 04:06.867
We'll find somebody who's young
and hungry and cheap.

04:06.867 --> 04:09.079
Oh, by the way, I'm gonna see
Scarlett and Gunnar

04:09.079 --> 04:10.371
this weekend
at the Bluebird.

04:10.371 --> 04:12.503
With Zach Welles,
incidentally.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.084
- Oh, your new best friend.

04:14.084 --> 04:16.337
- Well, you know all my best
friends are billionaires.

04:16.337 --> 04:17.798
- (chuckles)
Why don't you ask him

04:17.798 --> 04:19.139
if he's got 100 grand
laying around someplace

04:19.139 --> 04:21.091
he wouldn't mind us
using on the video?

04:21.091 --> 04:23.223
- Yeah.

04:23.223 --> 04:26.226
- Why would you tell someone
they're not ready?

04:26.226 --> 04:29.149
Isn't it her job
to be encouraging?

04:29.149 --> 04:30.851
- I'm sure she didn't
mean it that way.

04:30.851 --> 04:33.233
- I should call Tom Ericson.
- Who?

04:33.233 --> 04:34.695
- The medical director

04:34.695 --> 04:36.777
who asked me to send
the poster for his daughter.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.489
He runs the whole place.

04:38.489 --> 04:41.662
- You sure you want
to go over her head?

04:41.662 --> 04:43.574
- You don't have to do that.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.036
- I'm not doing anything.

04:46.036 --> 04:49.370
- No. I mean
cut the crust off.

04:49.370 --> 04:53.123
- Oh. Well, I know that's
how you like it, so...

04:53.123 --> 04:55.295
- But, really, it's fine.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.339
- Okay. Better eat fast.

04:58.339 --> 05:01.181
Emily's coming by
to drive you to psych.

05:02.683 --> 05:04.184
- I canceled my appointment.

05:05.686 --> 05:08.098
All the shrink wants
to talk about is the crash.

05:08.098 --> 05:10.230
I don't feel like
reliving it every week.

05:10.230 --> 05:11.602
- Yeah, but you can't
just not go.

05:11.602 --> 05:13.394
I mean, it's your treatment.

05:13.394 --> 05:15.195
- Well, shouldn't I have
some say over my treatment?

05:15.195 --> 05:16.987
- Of course.

05:16.987 --> 05:20.280
- Okay, well, I'd like to spend
the little energy that I have

05:20.280 --> 05:21.742
on things
that are more important.

05:21.742 --> 05:23.534
Like getting
out of that chair.

05:23.534 --> 05:26.707
- Right. Sorry.

05:26.707 --> 05:27.948
- What?

05:29.540 --> 05:30.791
- What?

05:30.791 --> 05:32.623
- You have a look
on your face.

05:32.623 --> 05:35.255
- This is just my face.

05:35.255 --> 05:38.088
- Oh. I guess
I never noticed.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.011
- I'm gonna go
check on Cadence.

05:51.522 --> 05:53.063
(groans)

06:24.465 --> 06:27.968
- Tell me again why we gotta
wine and dine this dude.

06:27.968 --> 06:29.349
- Well, we don't have to,

06:29.349 --> 06:31.512
but, you know,
he's in Nashville,

06:31.512 --> 06:33.724
and he's interested in
the country music business.

06:33.724 --> 06:35.686
- Or is he interested
in you?

06:35.686 --> 06:37.978
- Oh, please.
He's 12 years old,

06:37.978 --> 06:39.780
and I've made it very clear

06:39.780 --> 06:42.112
that you and I together
are taking him out.

06:42.112 --> 06:43.864
- Seems like
he's a little odd.

06:43.864 --> 06:46.487
In all these articles, they talk
about the off-beat entrepreneur,

06:46.487 --> 06:48.078
like that's his thing
or something.

06:48.078 --> 06:49.660
- Well,
it's probably accurate.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.702
You know, he's a nice guy.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.875
Seems smart.
I don't know.

06:54.875 --> 06:56.376
- I don't know what?

06:56.376 --> 07:01.882
- He is a big fan
and he's got a lot of money.

07:01.882 --> 07:03.003
- You're thinking maybe
he'll be able to help

07:03.003 --> 07:04.094
the company a little bit.

07:04.094 --> 07:08.098
- I think that
sometimes, yes.

07:08.098 --> 07:10.180
And then I think
it's guys like him

07:10.180 --> 07:11.852
and the whole digital world

07:11.852 --> 07:13.514
that have screwed up
the country music business

07:13.514 --> 07:14.725
in the first place.

07:14.725 --> 07:17.357
- Then you think
about the money again.

07:17.357 --> 07:20.060
- Shut up.
- (laughs)

07:23.524 --> 07:25.025
- Kevin, it's 10 A.M.

07:25.025 --> 07:26.987
I'm here.
Where are you?

07:26.987 --> 07:28.949
- I'm so sorry.
I got called in to work

07:28.949 --> 07:30.741
on that song
with Kacey Musgraves.

07:30.741 --> 07:32.202
- Well, should I reschedule?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.535
- No, no. You go.
I've already seen it.

07:34.535 --> 07:35.956
- Okay.

07:35.956 --> 07:40.290
- Oh, and I told the guy
that we were roommates.

07:40.290 --> 07:41.882
- What?

07:41.882 --> 07:43.714
- You never know what
peoples' biases are gonna be.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.756
They can decide not to rent
to you for any reason,

07:45.756 --> 07:47.718
and I didn't want
to give them one.

07:47.718 --> 07:49.009
- Yeah, well,
if they're homophobic,

07:49.009 --> 07:50.220
why would we even
want to live here?

07:50.220 --> 07:53.053
- Hardwood floors,
underground parking,

07:53.053 --> 07:54.354
incredible views.

07:54.354 --> 07:55.936
- Kevin?

07:55.936 --> 07:57.477
- Hey, I got to go.
- Okay.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.560
- Hi. I'm Frank.
You must be Kevin.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.863
- No, actually,
I'm his...roommate.

08:02.863 --> 08:03.864
- All right.
Well, come on in.

08:03.864 --> 08:05.776
Let's show you around.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.205
Floor to ceiling windows,
fireplace, of course.

08:15.205 --> 08:19.249
There is the second bedroom,
or study if you'd like.

08:19.249 --> 08:23.173
By the way, the kitchens here
are amazing for entertaining.

08:23.173 --> 08:26.176
And last but not least,
we have the master bedroom.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.178
- Hmm.

08:28.178 --> 08:30.891
- What a view, huh?

08:30.891 --> 08:34.935
Picture waking up to that
every single morning.

08:34.935 --> 08:37.187
Taking a shower
in the master bath.

08:37.187 --> 08:39.099
Going into the kitchen.

08:39.099 --> 08:40.520
Making pancakes.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.523
- Yeah,
I can really picture it.

08:43.523 --> 08:45.946
- Okay, I know exactly
what you're thinking.

08:45.946 --> 08:48.068
What's the catch?

08:48.068 --> 08:51.321
- (chuckles) No, that's
not what I was thinking.

08:51.321 --> 08:53.323
No, it all seems great.

08:53.323 --> 08:54.534
- And it is great.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.536
Did I mention it comes
fully furnished?

08:56.536 --> 08:57.918
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

08:57.918 --> 09:00.000
You have got to try
this Sleep Number bed.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.042
It is beyond comfortable.

09:07.588 --> 09:09.800
- Wow.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.552
(chuckles)

09:12.552 --> 09:15.345
Yeah, the thing is,
I'm not sure it's really...

09:15.345 --> 09:16.677
- What you're looking for?

09:16.677 --> 09:18.058
- Exactly.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.391
- Well,
what are you looking for?

09:21.391 --> 09:24.314
- (chuckles)

09:24.314 --> 09:26.026
That's a good question.

09:26.026 --> 09:27.487
- Well, no pressure.

09:27.487 --> 09:30.651
But just so you know,
there is a lot of interest.

09:30.651 --> 09:32.743
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:32.743 --> 09:34.284
The neighborhood's
really hot right now.

09:34.284 --> 09:36.406
Some great restaurants,
clubs in the area,

09:36.406 --> 09:38.619
if you like to go out.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.701
- Yeah, I do.

09:40.701 --> 09:42.332
- Well, think it over.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.544
I live in the building,
so I'm always available

09:44.544 --> 09:46.797
if you want to come back
with your roommate.

09:46.797 --> 09:49.009
- Right.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.844
Well, I should...

09:53.844 --> 09:56.596
- Yeah, sure. Well,
you have my number, so...

09:56.596 --> 09:59.019
- Yeah.

09:59.019 --> 10:01.932
- I'd love to have you
in the building.

10:08.729 --> 10:12.192
- Now, don't be disappointed
if you don't get very far.

10:12.192 --> 10:15.325
It's normal since you're doing
this way ahead of schedule.

10:15.325 --> 10:17.157
- Well, the medical director

10:17.157 --> 10:19.199
doesn't seem to think
it's too soon.

10:19.199 --> 10:22.332
- Yeah, he's got
all those degrees.

10:22.332 --> 10:24.584
I just work with people.

10:24.584 --> 10:26.957
Okay,
you are fully supported,

10:26.957 --> 10:29.009
so you don't have
to worry about falling.

10:29.009 --> 10:31.091
The harness will automatically
lock and catch you.

10:31.091 --> 10:33.423
I'm gonna be right here
beside you the whole time.

10:36.346 --> 10:38.558
You ready to take
your first step?

10:38.558 --> 10:40.310
- Hell, yes.

10:46.566 --> 10:49.399
- Okay, let's do it.

10:53.033 --> 10:54.654
Try to walk.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.489
You can do it.

11:00.831 --> 11:02.122
Does it hurt?

11:03.994 --> 11:05.245
- Want me to help
lift your foot?

11:05.245 --> 11:06.246
- No.

11:06.246 --> 11:07.587
- Just remember to breathe.

11:07.587 --> 11:11.051
Trust that
you're not gonna fall.

11:11.051 --> 11:12.592
Juliette.
- I can't breathe!

11:12.592 --> 11:14.174
I can't breathe!

11:14.174 --> 11:15.756
I can't breathe!
- It's okay.

11:15.756 --> 11:17.387
- I can't breathe!
- It's okay. You're okay.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.299
I'm gonna get your chair.

11:19.299 --> 11:22.222
- (gasping)

11:29.069 --> 11:31.691
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.693
- You went through
something terrifying.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.155
You're still processing it.

11:35.155 --> 11:36.406
That's what flashbacks are.

11:36.406 --> 11:37.738
It's your mind
trying to protect you.

11:37.738 --> 11:42.202
- How'd you know
that's what it was?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.624
- I was in
my own kind of accident.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.326
I mean,
not exactly like yours,

11:46.326 --> 11:49.169
but I know that it's easy

11:49.169 --> 11:51.591
to get so focused
on fixing your body,

11:51.591 --> 11:53.924
you forget that your soul
needs to heal, too.

11:53.924 --> 11:56.636
- So how long
is it gonna last?

11:56.636 --> 11:59.219
When am I gonna be
back to normal?

11:59.219 --> 12:00.600
- I wish
I had a good answer.

12:00.600 --> 12:02.222
It's gonna take time.

12:04.434 --> 12:07.397
- Well, thank you
for not saying I told you so.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.850
- (laughs) You thought
I was gonna say that?

12:09.850 --> 12:17.117
- I don't know.
You seem so...tough.

12:17.117 --> 12:19.359
- I thought you seemed
pretty tough, too.

12:19.359 --> 12:22.742
Hey, you weren't ready
today, but you will be.

12:29.669 --> 12:32.292
- Oh, there he is.
Welcome to Nashville.

12:32.292 --> 12:34.254
- Thank you so much.
So cool to be here.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.176
- Yeah.
Oh, this is Deacon, Zach.

12:36.176 --> 12:37.677
- How you doing?
- Oh, my God.

12:37.677 --> 12:39.179
I cannot believe
I'm shaking hands

12:39.179 --> 12:40.760
with Deacon Claybourne.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.382
No, I feel like I know you
from your songs,

12:42.382 --> 12:44.344
although you probably
get that all the time.

12:44.344 --> 12:46.016
- 24/7.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.437
- How was your flight in?

12:47.437 --> 12:49.019
- Pretty chill.
We stopped off in Jackson Hole

12:49.019 --> 12:50.020
to surprise my cousin
for his birthday.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.441
- Oh, fun.
- Yeah.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.443
- Megan's here.
- Oh, there's the mayor.

12:53.443 --> 12:55.695
- Megan?
Hey, you look amazing.

12:55.695 --> 12:56.736
- It's so good to see you.

12:56.736 --> 12:58.398
- I'm hoping it's cool
I invited her to join us.

12:58.398 --> 12:59.900
You guys know each other,
right?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.822
- Of course. Hey.
- Good to see you guys.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.613
- You, too.
- They're starting.

13:03.613 --> 13:04.905
- How do you know Zach?

13:04.905 --> 13:06.076
- Oh, we met at a benefit.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.287
- You know,
I'm not surprised.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.578
He knows everybody.
- He really does.

13:08.578 --> 13:09.870
- It's that time.

13:09.870 --> 13:11.711
Please
put your hands together

13:11.711 --> 13:13.964
for Scarlett O'Connor
and Gunnar Scott,

13:13.964 --> 13:15.335
the Exes.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.878
- Whoo! Whoo!
(cheers and applause)

13:20.010 --> 13:21.631
- Hey, y'all.

13:21.631 --> 13:23.513
It is such a pleasure
to be here tonight.

13:23.513 --> 13:24.724
Thank you for coming.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.346
It's a real special night
for us,

13:26.346 --> 13:28.808
'cause this stage
is where we really started.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.731
And my sweet family is here.
I love you guys.

13:31.731 --> 13:33.353

15:49.949 --> 15:52.372
and says as nicely as possible,
"It's no biggie,

15:52.372 --> 15:54.414
but it's pronounced
Hermes."

15:54.414 --> 15:56.626
(laughter)

15:56.626 --> 15:57.917
- Whenever you are ready,
Mr. Welles.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.249
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, no, no!

15:59.249 --> 16:01.341
- Uh-uh-uh.
It's already done.

16:01.341 --> 16:03.503
- Oh, my gosh. Thank you.

16:03.503 --> 16:06.586
- Thank you for gracing us
with those epic pipes.

16:06.586 --> 16:08.508
- Thank you again.

16:08.508 --> 16:10.470
- Well, we should probably
get going, right?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.472
- Yeah. It's delightful
to meet you both.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.723
- Likewise, man.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.095
- Really nice
to have met you.

16:15.095 --> 16:16.806
- Mwah. (laughs)

16:16.806 --> 16:18.398
- Beautiful as always.

16:18.398 --> 16:21.811
Talk to y'all soon, okay?
Bye.

16:21.811 --> 16:24.984
- See you, guys.
- Bye, guys.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.237
Wow. They are phenomenal.
- Yeah.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.869
- What's your plan for them?

16:29.869 --> 16:31.571
- We're trying to put together
a music video.

16:31.571 --> 16:34.204
We just have to find
a really great director.

16:34.204 --> 16:37.117
- Totally. This has been
such a great night.

16:37.117 --> 16:39.379
Thank you, guys.
- Thank you.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.831
- Okay, look,
this might sound crazy,

16:41.831 --> 16:43.173
but I'm just gonna say it.

16:43.173 --> 16:44.754
I see an opportunity

16:44.754 --> 16:49.389
and I would like to explore it
with you, with Highway 65.

16:49.389 --> 16:51.391
- Oh.

16:51.391 --> 16:52.592
- I've reached
a point in my life

16:52.592 --> 16:54.264
where I only want to do things
that I'm passionate about,

16:54.264 --> 16:55.805
and I do not want
to waste any time.

16:55.805 --> 16:59.729
And I got this instinct
about you, the company and me,

16:59.729 --> 17:01.941
I think it could make
a good marriage.

17:01.941 --> 17:06.446
So if you are interested,
let's talk.

17:17.327 --> 17:23.163
- The guy has spent like
three hours with you total.

17:23.163 --> 17:24.164
- Well, he also says

17:24.164 --> 17:25.545
that he's been obsessed
with our music for years.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.127
He said he feels
like he knows us.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.379
- So he decides to go
in business with you

17:29.379 --> 17:31.431
just based on this feeling
he's got?

17:31.431 --> 17:33.303
That's it?
What's in it for him?

17:33.303 --> 17:36.226
- He said he wants
to do what he loves.

17:36.226 --> 17:37.597
- And that's enough?

17:37.597 --> 17:39.889
You think he got his billions
by doing what he loves?

17:39.889 --> 17:41.601
- Honey, I have no idea.

17:41.601 --> 17:44.274
I hope he did.
I would respect that.

17:44.274 --> 17:46.356
I think it's worth
hearing him out.

17:48.238 --> 17:50.240
You really didn't like him,
did you?

17:50.240 --> 17:51.821
- It's not that
I didn't like him.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.693
I mean, he's a nice enough guy
and everything.

17:53.693 --> 17:56.956
But it's just
a little weird, that's all.

17:56.956 --> 17:58.788
- I agree.
It's a little weird.

17:58.788 --> 18:01.331
I'm not even sure I want to
go into business with him.

18:01.331 --> 18:04.374
But the idea of
actually having some money

18:04.374 --> 18:05.705
for my business is exciting.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.756
- Mm-hmm.

18:09.048 --> 18:10.630
Come here.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.807
"Make a good marriage."

18:17.807 --> 18:22.182
- That was
a figure of speech.

18:22.182 --> 18:25.645
(doorbell rings)

18:28.688 --> 18:30.610
- Psst. Hey.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.111
I'm not here.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.193
- Okay.

18:34.694 --> 18:36.236
Hey.
- Hey, man.

18:36.236 --> 18:39.038
Hey, Will around?
- No. He left earlier.

18:39.038 --> 18:41.331
- Damn it. I've been trying
to reach him all day.

18:41.331 --> 18:43.413
- Yeah.

18:43.413 --> 18:47.547
(cell phone rings)

18:47.547 --> 18:48.628
- Is that his phone?

18:48.628 --> 18:51.711
- Well, maybe he is here.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.513
- Hey!

18:56.596 --> 18:58.178
- So you are alive.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.139
I texted you like 12 times.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.392
- Yeah, sorry.
My phone was dead.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.106
- So what did you think?

19:07.106 --> 19:08.898
- About what?

19:08.898 --> 19:13.233
- About the controversy
surrounding stem cell research.

19:13.233 --> 19:16.035
About the apartment.
Did you love it?

19:16.035 --> 19:18.117
- It was fine.

19:18.117 --> 19:19.449
- Just fine?

19:19.449 --> 19:21.451
- Well, I don't know.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.042
Can I get to the...

19:23.042 --> 19:24.624
- So what's wrong
with this one?

19:24.624 --> 19:26.206
- Nothing.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.628
- Clearly there's something.
- No, it was great.

19:28.628 --> 19:30.550
- Then why do you
look like that?

19:33.002 --> 19:34.924
- I woke up with a headache.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.387
- Oh, penguin.

19:39.349 --> 19:41.681
I'll start filling out
the application, okay?

19:41.681 --> 19:44.604
And then you can fill in
your part.

19:47.227 --> 19:48.568
- Cool.

19:52.732 --> 19:54.814
- Mmm.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.946
Mmm. (chuckles)

19:56.946 --> 19:59.078
- Mm-hmm.
- Best ribs in the city.

19:59.078 --> 20:00.159
- Mm-hmm.

20:00.159 --> 20:01.581
- Thank you
for meeting me here.

20:01.581 --> 20:03.493
I was starving.

20:03.493 --> 20:05.084
- Oh, yeah, of course.
I love this place.

20:05.084 --> 20:06.586
- Okay,
so I just keep thinking

20:06.586 --> 20:08.958
what you've built here
is so special,

20:08.958 --> 20:11.831
so pure of intent, the way
you put the artists first,

20:11.831 --> 20:13.002
it should be protected.

20:13.002 --> 20:15.295
And I know you're struggling

20:15.295 --> 20:17.387
like everyone else
in the industry,

20:17.387 --> 20:19.509
so here's my pitch.

20:19.509 --> 20:21.641
I lay out a certain amount
of money each year,

20:21.641 --> 20:22.842
enough to keep you afloat,

20:22.842 --> 20:24.344
to keep investing
in new artists.

20:24.344 --> 20:27.397
In exchange, I get 20%
of the company.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.349
Now, you still make
all of the decisions.

20:29.349 --> 20:30.810
I just have the right
of consultation,

20:30.810 --> 20:34.774
and I ask that you consider
the advice of my team.

20:34.774 --> 20:36.566
Which doesn't mean
that you have to take it.

20:36.566 --> 20:38.197
I mean, if this didn't work
for whatever reason,

20:38.197 --> 20:40.360
either of us could end it
with 90 days notice.

20:40.360 --> 20:41.911
Because I only want
to be in business

20:41.911 --> 20:43.783
with people who want to be
in business with me.

20:43.783 --> 20:44.914
- Good philosophy.

20:44.914 --> 20:46.576
- Yeah. That's it.

20:46.576 --> 20:49.579
If you will let me,
I think I can help Highway 65

20:49.579 --> 20:52.752
flourish in the way
it deserves to.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.004
- It's an interesting
proposition.

20:55.004 --> 20:58.177
You have a little sauce
right on the--

20:58.177 --> 21:00.930
Other side.
Yeah, yeah.

21:00.930 --> 21:03.643
- Thank you.
Yeah, see? You get it.

21:03.643 --> 21:04.644
When you have money,

21:04.644 --> 21:06.306
no one tells you when
you have sauce on your face.

21:24.664 --> 21:27.787
- Oh! Aah!

21:27.787 --> 21:30.209
- Juliette? Oh!

21:30.209 --> 21:32.712
- Oh, I'm fine.
- No, that's okay.

21:32.712 --> 21:35.084
- Don't touch me!
I can do it myself!

21:35.084 --> 21:37.377
- Okay. Okay.

21:37.377 --> 21:39.919
Here,
let me get you a pill.

21:39.919 --> 21:44.303
- No. No. No.
Avery, it's not that bad.

21:46.686 --> 21:49.098
- You haven't been
taking them, have you?

21:49.098 --> 21:51.431
- I can't.

21:51.431 --> 21:52.812
- Juliette.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.273
- I can't rely on a drug

21:54.273 --> 21:57.146
to get me through
the pain, okay?

21:57.146 --> 21:58.358
I've been through that.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.609
You want to go through that
again?

21:59.609 --> 22:00.900
You want Cadence
to go through that?

22:00.900 --> 22:02.402
- Look,
we've been through this.

22:02.402 --> 22:04.283
The doctor said as long as
your dosage is monitored--

22:04.283 --> 22:06.245
- Yeah, that's easy
for her to say.

22:06.245 --> 22:08.748
I'm the one
who has to live with myself.

22:08.748 --> 22:12.832
You have no idea what it's like
to want to escape,

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
to be so tempted
to take them.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.166
- Look,
I know it's not easy,

22:17.166 --> 22:19.669
but I also know
that you can't get better

22:19.669 --> 22:20.960
unless you take what
the doctor prescribed you.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.423
- It's my decision, okay?

22:23.423 --> 22:26.095
I might not be able to do
anything for myself,

22:26.095 --> 22:28.598
but I sure as hell can keep
myself off those pills!

22:28.598 --> 22:30.890
- Listen,
I am trying to help you.

22:30.890 --> 22:33.102
- Stop! Stop helping!

22:33.102 --> 22:36.105
It makes me--
I hate it!

22:36.105 --> 22:38.778
And we both know
you don't want to do it!

22:38.778 --> 22:39.979
- What?

22:39.979 --> 22:42.071
- Oh, come on!
Just admit it!

22:42.071 --> 22:43.613
You feel obligated!

22:43.613 --> 22:44.944
Like it's your job
to take care of me!

22:44.944 --> 22:46.035
- What are you
talking about?

22:46.035 --> 22:47.447
That is not how I feel!

22:47.447 --> 22:48.868
- That's how anyone
would feel!

22:48.868 --> 22:50.910
- God, you are such
a pain in the ass!

22:50.910 --> 22:52.161
You know that?
And don't worry.

22:52.161 --> 22:53.793
It has nothing to do
with you being hurt.

22:53.793 --> 22:56.165
Because you've been like this
since the day I met you.

22:56.165 --> 22:57.707
You just push people away,

22:57.707 --> 23:00.259
because God forbid
you might ever need anyone!

23:13.973 --> 23:16.065
- What?

23:16.065 --> 23:17.777
The listing went down.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.899
They must have given it
to someone else.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.400
- Oh.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.732
- How did we not get it?

23:22.732 --> 23:24.694
You sent the application
Monday, right?

23:24.694 --> 23:26.155
- Yeah.

23:26.155 --> 23:27.657
- Damn.

23:27.657 --> 23:31.621
- You know, that place
wasn't that great anyway.

23:31.621 --> 23:33.623
The bathroom was cramped,

23:33.623 --> 23:37.126
and the kitchen
kind of had a weird smell.

23:37.126 --> 23:38.458
Did you notice that?

23:38.458 --> 23:42.001
- No. I thought
it was pretty perfect.

23:42.001 --> 23:44.253
- Sorry.

23:44.253 --> 23:45.925
- Yeah,
I'm just disappointed.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.426
- I know.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.180
- Well, back to Craigslist.

23:59.058 --> 24:01.360
- You don't have to come in
with me.

24:01.360 --> 24:03.362
- No, it's no big deal,
really.

24:03.362 --> 24:05.945
- No. I mean,
I don't want you to.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.406
- Oh.

24:07.406 --> 24:10.780
- I'm sorry. I just
got to do this by myself.

24:41.771 --> 24:44.774
- Well, hello.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.946
Sorry to interrupt.

24:46.946 --> 24:48.447
I just wanted you to know

24:48.447 --> 24:52.031
that I was here just in case
you'd like to talk.

24:52.031 --> 24:53.282
- Okay.

24:55.535 --> 24:57.827
Wait.

25:00.540 --> 25:02.381
Actually, never mind.

25:02.381 --> 25:05.044
- Well, you might as well ask
just what you want to ask.

25:05.044 --> 25:06.465
It's what I'm here for.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.628
- (sighs)

25:08.628 --> 25:10.630
I hardly ever do this.

25:10.630 --> 25:12.892
- Do what?

25:12.892 --> 25:14.473
- Pray.

25:14.473 --> 25:17.727
- You want to pray?

25:17.727 --> 25:23.022
- Yeah,
but I don't know how to.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.815
- There's no way how,
no one way.

25:25.815 --> 25:31.030
It's just a conversation
between you and God.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.413
- How do I start?
What am I supposed to do?

25:34.413 --> 25:37.456
- There's nothing to do.

25:37.456 --> 25:39.328
Just say what you feel.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.977
- I just have one question.

26:03.983 --> 26:06.065
Why me?

26:09.859 --> 26:14.784
Why me and not the other people
on that plane?

26:14.784 --> 26:18.077
It's not 'cause
I'm a better person.

26:20.750 --> 26:22.662
I don't understand.

26:27.206 --> 26:29.258
I'm lost.

26:31.971 --> 26:35.765
Help me, please?

27:03.582 --> 27:08.337
(cell phone rings)

27:11.380 --> 27:13.342
- Hello?

27:13.342 --> 27:15.464
- Rayna.
Hey, it's Zach Welles.

27:15.464 --> 27:17.757
- Oh, hey, Zach.

27:17.757 --> 27:19.849
- Listen, it just hit me.

27:19.849 --> 27:22.561
I got the perfect director
for you: Damien George.

27:22.561 --> 27:23.933
- Damien George?

27:23.933 --> 27:26.185
- Yeah, his movie with
J-Law just fell apart.

27:26.185 --> 27:27.436
- I don't think
Damien George

27:27.436 --> 27:29.398
is gonna want to do
a music video, Zach.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.230
- You have no idea
the favor this guy owes me.

27:31.230 --> 27:32.441
He was two weeks into shooting
"Night Dogs"

27:32.441 --> 27:33.693
when the bond company--

27:33.693 --> 27:35.234
- Look, that's
so generous of you,

27:35.234 --> 27:36.655
but I just think--

27:36.655 --> 27:38.657
- No, seriously, they
were gonna shut him down.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.159
I mean, they came to set--

27:40.159 --> 27:41.991
- I just think we have to
slow it down a little bit.

27:41.991 --> 27:45.204
I mean, I'm still considering
your proposition.

27:45.204 --> 27:48.047
- Right, of course you are.

27:48.047 --> 27:50.459
Sorry. This is what happens
when I get excited.

27:50.459 --> 27:51.751
I get ahead of myself.

27:51.751 --> 27:53.092
Hey, listen,
I want you to know

27:53.092 --> 27:55.294
I'm honestly not trying
to pressure you

27:55.294 --> 27:57.426
or influence
your decision in any way.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.428
I respect you too much
for that crap.

27:59.428 --> 28:00.850
- Well, I appreciate it.

28:00.850 --> 28:02.681
- Yeah,
and this Damien thing,

28:02.681 --> 28:05.014
it has nothing to do
with our deal

28:05.014 --> 28:06.856
or lack thereof.

28:06.856 --> 28:08.858
You could say no right now
and I'd be totally willing

28:08.858 --> 28:11.440
to hook you up with Damien
no strings attached.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.233
- Thank you. Well, I'm gonna
keep thinking about all of it.

28:14.233 --> 28:16.405
And you have a good time,

28:16.405 --> 28:18.117
and I'll see you
when you get back here.

28:18.117 --> 28:19.448
- Sweet. See you later.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.740
- Bye.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.534
- What's all this?

28:25.534 --> 28:27.206
- I don't know.

28:31.250 --> 28:32.331
- (sighs)

28:37.676 --> 28:40.299
- Wow.

28:40.299 --> 28:43.102
It's been a while
since we got one of these.

28:43.102 --> 28:45.684
You remember that woman
who sent you her socks?

28:45.684 --> 28:48.147
Sure was easy to keep
your address private

28:48.147 --> 28:49.398
before the internet.

28:49.398 --> 28:50.519
- Well, this didn't even
come through the mail.

28:50.519 --> 28:51.650
It didn't have a stamp on it
or anything.

28:51.650 --> 28:52.982
- Which means
they were here.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.273
- I don't know.

28:54.273 --> 28:56.235
This stuff
makes me nervous these days.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.407
- I know. I mean,
chances are he's harmless,

28:58.407 --> 29:00.029
but if it makes you
feel better,

29:00.029 --> 29:01.991
you might want to beef up your
home security just in case.

29:01.991 --> 29:04.163
I mean, I don't think you
should lose any sleep over it.

29:04.163 --> 29:06.745
Better to lose sleep

29:06.745 --> 29:08.287
over what's gonna happen
with the label.

29:08.287 --> 29:09.999
- Nice.

29:09.999 --> 29:12.541
- Don't worry. I'm losing sleep
over that too, Bucky.

29:12.541 --> 29:14.173
- Any closer
to making a decision?

29:14.173 --> 29:15.835
- Oh, I don't know.

29:15.835 --> 29:17.877
I just can't help but think
this whole thing with Zach

29:17.877 --> 29:19.718
is just too good to be true.

29:19.718 --> 29:21.971
- Yeah, well, sometimes those
things turn out to be true.

29:21.971 --> 29:23.222
You did.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.554
- What? You think
I should do it now?

29:25.554 --> 29:27.226
- Well, I was listening
to him on the phone,

29:27.226 --> 29:29.648
and I started thinking maybe
this is right, you know.

29:29.648 --> 29:32.231
Maybe we should just
accept our good fortune.

29:32.231 --> 29:34.023
- Just not before
we talk to Sheila, though.

29:34.023 --> 29:35.734
- Oh, of course, I'm gonna have
a lawyer look at the contract.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.736
I have a feeling she'll find
a million loopholes

29:37.736 --> 29:39.358
that are just gonna
screw us over.

29:39.358 --> 29:41.160
- What if she doesn't?

29:41.160 --> 29:42.571
- Well, if she doesn't,

29:42.571 --> 29:44.533
then we're just gonna
have to make damn sure

29:44.533 --> 29:47.456
that Zach and I want
the same thing for the label.

29:47.456 --> 29:50.409
- It sure would help us
make this album of ours.

29:58.337 --> 30:00.549
- It's a visual love letter

30:00.549 --> 30:03.342
to a woman
so electric and alive,

30:03.342 --> 30:04.924
she can't be contained.

30:04.924 --> 30:07.847
She's messy,
she's passionate.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.558
She's feeling
everything at once.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.021
- You got all that
from the song?

30:12.021 --> 30:13.893
- The song's just
the jumping off point.

30:13.893 --> 30:15.314
It's like a dream.

30:15.314 --> 30:18.027
I'm seeing
this wild creature

30:18.027 --> 30:19.528
who doesn't know
how to be in the world,

30:19.528 --> 30:21.360
and the man who loves her,

30:21.360 --> 30:23.532
who wants to hold onto her,
but can't.

30:23.532 --> 30:26.785
And it's set in one of those
grand sweeping mansions,

30:26.785 --> 30:31.160
this sort of backdrop
of old world propriety.

30:42.631 --> 30:44.263
- I'm a terrible person.

30:44.263 --> 30:45.764
- No, you're not.

30:45.764 --> 30:47.176
- Well,
you have to say that

30:47.176 --> 30:48.387
'cause you're my friend.

30:48.387 --> 30:49.728
- You did the right thing
in a way.

30:49.728 --> 30:51.971
I mean, you knew
if you stayed in that place,

30:51.971 --> 30:53.933
you'd always be tempted.

30:53.933 --> 30:55.644
- Yeah, but it's not
just that guy.

30:55.644 --> 30:58.737
It's guys on the street,
at my gigs,

30:58.737 --> 31:00.479
at the ATM just now.

31:00.479 --> 31:02.111
- Being tempted
isn't the same thing

31:02.111 --> 31:03.532
as following through
with it.

31:03.532 --> 31:06.195
- Yeah, but I can't
stop thinking about it.

31:06.195 --> 31:08.367
I keep thinking

31:08.367 --> 31:11.620
what would life be like
with someone else?

31:11.620 --> 31:13.082
- Sounds like you have FOMO.

31:13.082 --> 31:14.914
- What'd you call me?

31:14.914 --> 31:17.456
- Oh, FOMO.

31:17.456 --> 31:19.758
Fear of Missing Out.

31:19.758 --> 31:21.050
- (laughs) Oh.

31:21.050 --> 31:22.671
- Which makes sense.

31:22.671 --> 31:25.004
You know, he's your first
real relationship.

31:25.004 --> 31:26.425
It's not like you been
with a lot of dudes.

31:26.425 --> 31:28.347
- Yeah, but I never
even cared about that.

31:28.347 --> 31:31.010
All I wanted
was to be with him.

31:31.010 --> 31:33.602
He does this thing

31:33.602 --> 31:37.356
we saw in a documentary
about penguins.

31:37.356 --> 31:40.279
They touch foreheads.

31:40.279 --> 31:42.731
That's how they kiss.

31:42.731 --> 31:45.154
- That's nauseating.

31:45.154 --> 31:46.986
- Yeah, I know.

31:49.328 --> 31:51.660
I just gotta focus
on what's real.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.032
Me and him.

31:53.032 --> 31:55.534
You know,
once we're living together

31:55.534 --> 31:57.246
and we're with each other
every day,

31:57.246 --> 31:58.837
it's gonna be different.

31:58.837 --> 32:00.539
- Will, listen,

32:00.539 --> 32:03.422
I can't tell you
if you should stay with Kevin,

32:03.422 --> 32:06.135
but I can tell you that never
in the history of the world

32:06.135 --> 32:09.008
has moving in together
made things easier.

32:09.008 --> 32:11.470
Believe me,
it only gets harder.

32:11.470 --> 32:14.433
And if you love the person,
then it's worth it.

32:14.433 --> 32:19.228
But it will test you more
than you ever thought possible.

32:19.228 --> 32:21.480
- I'm such an ass
going on about this.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.941
You got real problems.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.063
- Well, I didn't
come out tonight

32:24.063 --> 32:25.234
to talk about my problems.

32:25.234 --> 32:26.775
Yours
are a welcome distraction.

32:26.775 --> 32:28.237
- I just don't know
if it's normal

32:28.237 --> 32:32.201
or if it means
something more,

32:32.201 --> 32:37.206
like...maybe we're not
meant to be together.

32:37.206 --> 32:39.538
- You got to figure out
what you want.

32:39.538 --> 32:41.960
I mean,
what you actually want,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.422
not what
you think you should.

32:45.084 --> 32:48.137
(pinball machine dings)

32:54.093 --> 32:55.514
- [Man on TV]
If you'd like to add

32:55.514 --> 32:58.017
more of Nick's recipes
in culinary adventures

32:58.017 --> 33:00.269
to your collection,
now you can.

33:00.269 --> 33:02.441
It's just this easy.

33:02.441 --> 33:05.404
The companion cookbook to
"Cooking With Nick Stellino"

33:05.404 --> 33:09.238
is available for 34.95
plus shipping and handling.

33:09.238 --> 33:12.241
The two disk DVD set
of the complete series

33:12.241 --> 33:13.492
and the CD-Rom of recipes...

33:13.492 --> 33:15.914
- Buy one now,
you get a bonus gift.

33:15.914 --> 33:18.747
- Don't tempt me.

33:18.747 --> 33:20.919
(turns off TV)

33:20.919 --> 33:22.921
The other day--
- Listen, Juliette--

33:22.921 --> 33:24.002
Oh, I'm sorry.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.884
- No, you go.

33:25.884 --> 33:28.927
- I'm just sorry.

33:28.927 --> 33:30.929
I shouldn't
have yelled like that.

33:30.929 --> 33:34.133
- You were right about me,

33:34.133 --> 33:39.598
about why I hate
being like this, helpless.

33:39.598 --> 33:41.560
- You're not helpless.
- You know what I mean.

33:41.560 --> 33:45.944
I don't want to need you,
but I do.

33:45.944 --> 33:47.276
I always have.

33:47.276 --> 33:49.608
- Come here.

33:53.862 --> 33:55.454
- I'm just so scared

33:55.454 --> 33:57.456
you're gonna start to feel
like I'm this burden.

33:57.456 --> 33:59.658
- No, never.

33:59.658 --> 34:01.290
I could never feel that way.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.581
You got to know that.

34:02.581 --> 34:04.123
- So I took it out on you.

34:04.123 --> 34:05.544
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry.

34:05.544 --> 34:07.546
I'm sorry that I lied to you
about the pills.

34:07.546 --> 34:10.879
- It's okay.
I know how hard it's been.

34:10.879 --> 34:14.263
I mean, I don't know.
I can only imagine.

34:14.263 --> 34:17.226
- It's been harder on you.
- What?

34:17.226 --> 34:20.769
- You're the one
who has to do everything.

34:20.769 --> 34:25.184
Feed me, make my appointments,
take care of the baby.

34:25.184 --> 34:27.816
- Juliette, I want to.

34:27.816 --> 34:30.989
- You do?

34:30.989 --> 34:32.451
- Yes.

34:41.830 --> 34:44.002
Whoa.

34:44.002 --> 34:45.914
Your arms
are getting strong.

34:45.914 --> 34:48.667
- One of the perks
of physical therapy.

34:48.667 --> 34:51.670
- You sure
you want to do this?

34:51.670 --> 34:53.091
- Yes.

34:56.595 --> 35:00.599
- I just...
I don't want to hurt you.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.311
- You won't.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.530
- Wait, wait.

35:11.530 --> 35:12.941
- Oh, I knew it.

35:12.941 --> 35:14.653
- No, it's not
what you think.

35:14.653 --> 35:16.074
- I'm just this broken thing

35:16.074 --> 35:17.946
that you're too afraid
to even touch.

35:17.946 --> 35:21.290
- You are the most beautiful
woman in the world to me.

35:21.290 --> 35:23.202
- Then what is it?

35:23.202 --> 35:24.873
- It's stupid.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.004
- Tell me.

35:26.004 --> 35:27.456
- (sighs)

35:30.249 --> 35:34.092
I just...

35:34.092 --> 35:37.306
I feel...

35:37.306 --> 35:43.101
It's like with everything
that happened with us...

35:43.101 --> 35:44.263
- Oh, my God.

35:44.263 --> 35:45.764
- It's okay.

35:45.764 --> 35:47.646
- I never wanted
to hurt you.

35:47.646 --> 35:52.070
- I wouldn't trade it,
not for a second.

35:54.533 --> 35:59.077
I don't think you have any idea
how much I love you.

36:01.830 --> 36:03.242
But I just--

36:03.242 --> 36:04.743
- You need time.

36:07.706 --> 36:08.957
- Yeah.

36:20.719 --> 36:23.181
- It's a pretty
straightforward contract.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.513
No surprises I can see.

36:24.513 --> 36:25.854
There's an escape clause

36:25.854 --> 36:27.726
that protects you
if you want to get out.

36:27.726 --> 36:30.399
There's no such thing
as free money,

36:30.399 --> 36:34.022
but this is about
as close as it gets.

36:39.027 --> 36:42.531
- You are cordially invited
to a loud club

36:42.531 --> 36:44.082
to come see
your boyfriend play.

36:53.592 --> 36:55.384
What's wrong?

36:57.836 --> 36:59.548
- I found this in the trash.

37:01.840 --> 37:04.343
You never sent it.

37:04.343 --> 37:06.014
- I didn't know what to do.

37:06.014 --> 37:09.898
I didn't...I didn't know
how to tell you.

37:09.898 --> 37:11.059
- Tell me what?

37:14.022 --> 37:16.234
There's someone else.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.736
- No.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.117
- It's so obvious.
- No, that's not it.

37:19.117 --> 37:20.409
- How can I believe you?

37:20.409 --> 37:21.950
You know how much
I wanted that apartment.

37:21.950 --> 37:24.533
- Look, you have every right
to hate me.

37:24.533 --> 37:28.457
I can't even explain why.
I just...

37:28.457 --> 37:32.250
- What? Just be real
with me, Will.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.542
- I don't...

37:36.254 --> 37:38.797
I don't want
to live with you.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.262
- This was your idea.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.644
- I know.

37:45.644 --> 37:47.886
- How long
have you felt this way?

37:47.886 --> 37:48.977
- A while, I guess.
I don't know.

37:48.977 --> 37:51.940
I didn't want it to be true.

37:51.940 --> 37:53.982
- Well,
I thought we were fine.

37:53.982 --> 37:56.655
I thought you were happy.
- I am.

37:56.655 --> 38:02.451
I just feel like
I need a little space or...

38:02.451 --> 38:04.282
- Are you breaking up with me?
- No.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.075
- It sure as hell feels like it.
- No, no, Kevin, Kevin.

38:07.075 --> 38:10.539
- If I hadn't found that
application in the trash,

38:10.539 --> 38:13.041
would you have told me
any of this?

38:18.417 --> 38:20.799
- I was trying
to find the right way.

38:20.799 --> 38:25.764
- You know, I had a feeling
from the beginning

38:25.764 --> 38:28.427
that you weren't ready
for a real relationship.

38:28.427 --> 38:31.890
I should have
trusted my gut.

38:31.890 --> 38:33.812
This isn't about
just moving in.

38:33.812 --> 38:37.315
This is the whole thing,
isn't it?

38:47.366 --> 38:49.207
- I'm sorry.

38:52.120 --> 38:54.953
[Emcee] All right. Y'all
having a good time tonight?

38:54.953 --> 38:58.377
Ha ha. All right,
let's keep things going.

38:58.377 --> 39:01.129
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the stage

39:01.129 --> 39:04.092
Will Lexington!

39:04.092 --> 39:06.224
(cheers and applause)

39:09.598 --> 39:12.180
(band plays upbeat music)

39:13.812 --> 39:14.933
- All right!

39:30.909 --> 39:34.292
(band stops playing)

39:40.208 --> 39:44.302
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just
not feeling that one tonight.

39:54.012 --> 39:57.436
I, uh...
I'd like to play you a song

39:57.436 --> 40:02.731
that I wrote with someone
real special,

40:02.731 --> 40:04.282
