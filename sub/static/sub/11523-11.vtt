WEBVTT

00:07.382 --> 00:10.051
Okay, Mom.

00:10.135 --> 00:13.138
My therapist thinks I should deal
with some stuff I've been avoiding.

00:13.221 --> 00:17.183
So I guess next, I'll be talking
to a picture of broccoli.

00:17.267 --> 00:21.229
But seriously, I do wish I had
an actual photograph of you for this.

00:22.647 --> 00:25.150
It would be cool if Geena Davis
were my mom, though.

00:25.233 --> 00:28.611
I'll be all, "I don't want to do
my homework, Geena Davis!"

00:28.695 --> 00:30.572
What are you doing to Geena?

00:30.655 --> 00:32.949
I did not get this
so you could talk to it.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.052
I got it because the dry cleaner guy's
back was turned

00:35.076 --> 00:36.595
and they owed me
for shrinking all my pants.

00:36.619 --> 00:37.871
Shut up.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.081
Well, Andrea wants me
to pretend to talk to my mom,

00:40.165 --> 00:43.042
so it's either this or that water stain
that looks like a face.

00:43.126 --> 00:45.003
Kimmy, that does not look like...

00:45.086 --> 00:47.088
Oh, my God, what do you want?

00:47.172 --> 00:48.465
I'll do whatever you say.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.176
Titus, my therapy homework is hard enough.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.778
I don't have time for you
to freak out at the wall...

00:52.802 --> 00:54.220
Who sent you?

00:54.304 --> 00:55.722
You're not welcome here! Aah!

00:55.805 --> 00:57.682
Look, if you want to talk to your mom,

00:57.766 --> 00:58.933
do regression therapy.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.518
It's something I saw on TV backwards.

01:00.602 --> 01:01.686
What do you mean backwards?

01:01.770 --> 01:04.081
I set up a system of mirrors so I could
see the TV from the toilet, okay?

01:04.105 --> 01:05.565
- Do you want my help or not?
- No.

01:05.648 --> 01:06.648
Too late!

01:08.401 --> 01:10.361
We're giving birth to baby Kimmy.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.946
This is dumb, Titus.

01:12.030 --> 01:14.449
I set aside today
for some serious Kimmy time.

01:14.532 --> 01:17.577
You can hear your mother's voice.

01:18.870 --> 01:20.723
"My baby, she's a-coming.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.583
And she's gonna be sweeter
than Mee-Maw's shoo-fly pie!"

01:23.666 --> 01:25.001
Are you trying to help me,

01:25.084 --> 01:27.045
or are you just practicing accents?

01:28.338 --> 01:29.815
Her vital signs are very good.

01:29.839 --> 01:31.549
I'm the hospital's top scientist.

01:32.717 --> 01:36.513
I'm the top nurse,
and I never seen ya before in my life!

01:36.596 --> 01:39.682
Someone call the Irish priest
who also does impressions!

01:41.184 --> 01:43.728
You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me?

01:44.729 --> 01:46.439
- Snap out of it!
- Hello?

01:46.523 --> 01:47.982
Surprise! It's Cyndee.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.651
Pokorny? From kidnapping?

01:49.734 --> 01:51.754
- I'll be back.
- I'm in New York!

01:51.778 --> 01:53.029
Wait, you're here?

01:53.113 --> 01:54.239
Like, now?

01:54.322 --> 01:56.199
"E.T. phone home."

02:29.524 --> 02:31.734
Unbelievable! A surprise visit?

02:31.818 --> 02:32.735
I like Cyndee.

02:32.819 --> 02:34.547
She's who I got
when I took the Mole Women Quiz.

02:34.571 --> 02:35.613
You were a Gretchen.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.700
Andrea gave me this sticker
at our last session.

02:38.783 --> 02:39.951
It's a sheep with a guitar,

02:40.034 --> 02:41.744
and it says, "Ewe rock!"

02:41.828 --> 02:43.746
How? It's not even plugged in.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.331
The plug's behind her, Titus!

02:45.415 --> 02:47.041
Andrea told me so!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.501
But it doesn't even matter.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.212
I can't rock now 'cause I'm gonna
get sucked into Cyndee's

02:51.296 --> 02:52.714
shenanigans againigans.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.757
Well, maybe this time,
you let Cyndee do Cyndee.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.551
That's the problem. She can't.

02:56.634 --> 02:57.719
She never could.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.139
Where have you been?

03:01.222 --> 03:02.223
It's Penance Night.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.725
We have to crank until dawn.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.184
I can't do it.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.769
Can Man dumped me.

03:06.853 --> 03:08.897
What? Cyndee, he's made of cans.

03:08.980 --> 03:12.191
I just want to lie in bed
and watch <i>Titanic </i> and cry.

03:16.195 --> 03:19.490
What do you want,
Bill Pullman or Paxton?

03:20.992 --> 03:22.869
I'm an old lady with no necklace.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.040
That movie is so sad.

03:27.123 --> 03:30.335
When Leonardo DiCaprio
has to draw that fat white girl...

03:30.418 --> 03:32.187
And she doesn't even want to hear
what I really think,

03:32.211 --> 03:34.464
'cause it's super
that she's engaged to a gay guy

03:34.547 --> 03:36.966
and her job is crying
and telling people she's a Mole Woman.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.093
Oh, and she's definitely fluent
in French now,

03:39.177 --> 03:40.845
'cause she went to college in a dream.

03:40.929 --> 03:44.057
Kimmy, I don't know what to say.

03:44.140 --> 03:46.643
So I'm hoping that the tone of my voice

03:46.726 --> 03:48.645
makes you think that I do, okay, sweetie?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.896
Thanks, Titus.

03:50.605 --> 03:51.898
Knock, knock!

03:51.981 --> 03:53.441
I always wanted to say that,

03:53.524 --> 03:56.027
but I was never on the other side
of a door from you!

03:59.906 --> 04:01.282
Grab it.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.283
I've been saving that for you

04:02.367 --> 04:05.286
ever since I caught it
at a Backstreet Boys concert.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.455
Did you know they're all the old one now?

04:07.538 --> 04:09.582
Oh...

04:09.666 --> 04:11.084
Titus!

04:24.013 --> 04:25.682
Hey, Titus!

04:25.765 --> 04:27.100
What's with the hair?

04:29.811 --> 04:32.272
You look Travolta with his wig off.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.691
I'll have you know

04:34.774 --> 04:36.317
this hairstyle is all the rage

04:36.401 --> 04:39.237
among hipsters and Pentecostal elders.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.989
Ha.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.157
Fine.

04:44.325 --> 04:47.245
I signed up for a drug trial
to make money.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.123
I can't shave my hair
because it might be a side effect.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.124
A drug trial?

04:51.207 --> 04:55.378
So you're helping Big Pharma
give old men boners?

04:55.461 --> 04:56.879
That's my job.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.465
You think I want to be doing this?

04:59.549 --> 05:02.176
I thought helping cure cancer or whatever

05:02.260 --> 05:03.678
would bring me respect.

05:03.761 --> 05:05.179
But it's humiliating.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.140
They treat me like a piece of meat

05:07.223 --> 05:09.350
but in a bad way.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.245
And I'm broke,
so I have to sit there and take it

05:11.269 --> 05:12.729
but in a bad way.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.605
Count your blessings.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.899
I chained myself to a bulldozer.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.860
I can't get anybody to notice.

05:18.943 --> 05:21.154
I mean, where is everybody?

05:21.237 --> 05:24.198
Mikey told me Shark Week
is now a union holiday.

05:24.282 --> 05:26.868
So I got to spend a whole week out here?

05:27.910 --> 05:30.413
It'll be all right.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.540
I'm doing this for the neighborhood,

05:32.623 --> 05:35.668
so the neighborhood will take care of me.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.253
Ah! See?

05:37.336 --> 05:38.796
I'm bored.

05:38.880 --> 05:42.008
The neighborhood brings me a newspaper.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.762
Oh, it's just a Learning Annex brochure.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.972
And I'm supposed to be teaching

05:48.056 --> 05:51.517
"Dress for Success" right now.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.520
Hey! Hey!

05:54.604 --> 05:55.646
Pff!

05:56.522 --> 05:59.150
The way I see it, being a Mole Woman
is a full-time job.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.360
When I get home, I have to cut the ribbon

06:01.444 --> 06:04.155
at the grand opening
of a new ribbon store.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.948
But how will I know when to stop cutting?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.700
And how's Brandon?

06:07.784 --> 06:08.701
Is he in New York?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.328
Mentally, always.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.788
And also, yeah.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.111
We still haven't set a date yet

06:13.164 --> 06:14.844
because he keeps planning bachelor parties

06:14.916 --> 06:17.376
with guys he meets on the Internet.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.088
Well, I'm just so happy for you...

06:20.171 --> 06:22.131
...kulele music.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.549
Thanks, Kimmy.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.051
My life's perfect.

06:25.134 --> 06:26.219
The only thing left to do

06:26.302 --> 06:28.888
is get married and start a family.

06:28.971 --> 06:30.681
Wow, family...

06:30.765 --> 06:32.350
with Brandon.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.185
And you'll be some kid's mother.

06:34.268 --> 06:36.354
Actually, I read
the average American family

06:36.437 --> 06:37.647
has two and a half kids,

06:37.730 --> 06:39.208
so I hope we get to choose which half,

06:39.232 --> 06:40.441
because I like the top.

06:40.525 --> 06:41.859
That's where the face is.

06:41.943 --> 06:42.985
Cyndee...

06:43.069 --> 06:46.823
But, um, my therapist
has his own ideas about that.

06:46.906 --> 06:48.449
You're in therapy?

06:48.533 --> 06:49.826
Mm-hmm.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.178
Get out back and hold the monkey!

06:51.202 --> 06:52.202
I'm in therapy!

06:52.245 --> 06:53.746
You?

06:53.830 --> 06:54.830
Wow!

06:54.872 --> 06:57.667
I was afraid you were gonna judge me
for getting help,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.544
'cause you were always so tough and...

06:59.627 --> 07:00.878
...in the bunker.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.214
And not just on the toilet pumpkin.

07:03.297 --> 07:04.340
Okay.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.467
You're getting help. That's great.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.219
So how long have you been in therapy?

07:08.302 --> 07:10.430
Well, I've only been doing it
a couple of weeks.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.824
And it's only been over the phone,

07:11.848 --> 07:13.474
because his office is actually here

07:13.558 --> 07:14.475
in Jew York.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.144
You should come with me.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.228
I'm meeting him today.

07:17.311 --> 07:18.311
That's great!

07:18.354 --> 07:20.022
And if you work super hard,

07:20.106 --> 07:21.524
maybe you'll get a sticker

07:21.607 --> 07:23.317
of a sheep with a plugged-in guitar

07:23.401 --> 07:26.237
and it says, "Ewe rock!"

07:29.949 --> 07:31.701
I don't get it.

07:33.202 --> 07:37.039
Tragedy can shape our minds,

07:37.123 --> 07:39.625
but it doesn't have to shape our futures.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.629
And that's what I want
to talk to you about today

07:41.711 --> 07:43.588
and all this week

07:43.671 --> 07:46.299
on <i>The Dr. Dave Show!</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:56.225
Please welcome your Superstars of Tragedy.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.103
A Celebration of Courage sponsored by

07:59.187 --> 08:00.980
Splotchguard Stain Blaster:

08:01.063 --> 08:04.317
"Life is messy.
Your clothes don't have to be."

08:04.400 --> 08:07.028
As a child, she spent three weeks
trapped in a well.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.280
It's well-baby, "Baby Debbie,"

08:09.363 --> 08:10.698
Deborah Wells!

08:15.703 --> 08:17.497
He has a disease so rare

08:17.580 --> 08:19.123
that they named it after him.

08:19.207 --> 08:22.210
Please welcome Thomas Vletchen
and his syndrome.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.052
You first met them as twins
conjoined at the crotch.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.553
Now one of them wants back in.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.554
It's Bob and Bub Kittle.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.102
She was eaten and then pooped out

08:41.187 --> 08:42.897
by the orca that she raised at SeaWorld...

08:42.980 --> 08:45.024
please do not applaud, it's a trigger...

08:45.107 --> 08:46.107
Holly Krieger.

08:48.986 --> 08:52.198
It's because Tonku kept doing shows
when I was in him

08:52.281 --> 08:54.575
and I could hear the crowd applaud.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.761
Totally understandable.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.870
Finally, Buzzfeed ranked her tragedy

08:57.954 --> 09:00.164
one of the top ten most disturbing

09:00.248 --> 09:02.333
bunker kidnappings of 2015.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.294
It's Indiana Mole Woman Cyndee Pokorny!

09:15.137 --> 09:19.016
Are you ready to heal?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.828
Forget blood cancer, Judy.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.706
We might just have a hair thickness drug
on our hands.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.584
Mr. Doctor, we have been standing here
for an hour.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.752
Give us our clothes, or turn up the heat.

09:46.836 --> 09:47.753
Take note.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.214
Meat Slab 35 is sensitive to temperature

09:50.298 --> 09:53.009
in addition to the obvious bloating
and shoulder loss.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.927
Lookit. Can I at least shave my head?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.447
I'm sorry, meat slabs,
but we have to continue monitoring this.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.307
I do apologize if it interferes

09:59.390 --> 10:01.851
with your fast-paced lifestyles
of subway masturbation

10:01.934 --> 10:03.894
and being set on fire by prep school kids.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.563
Now take your clothes.

10:05.646 --> 10:08.149
How dare you?

10:08.232 --> 10:10.109
I am a person who deserves respect.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.861
I will not be treated like an animal

10:11.944 --> 10:14.989
unless it's a glistening panther
emerging from an infinity pool.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.949
So I say to you, good day, sir.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
Patients who fail to complete the trial

10:19.243 --> 10:21.412
will not receive the other half
of their $20 bill.

10:22.496 --> 10:23.789
Very well.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.458
Do what you will with my body,

10:25.541 --> 10:27.752
but you will never take away my dignity.

10:29.920 --> 10:31.672
Who stole my clothes?

10:33.507 --> 10:35.926
Stupid hospital lost and found.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.264
What does it want?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.600
Titus, I don't know what I just saw.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.018
Okay.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.896
When two homeless men
love each very much...

10:46.979 --> 10:48.064
No, not this time.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.066
Have you ever heard of Dr. Dave?

10:50.149 --> 10:51.484
Heard <i>of </i> him?

10:51.567 --> 10:53.110
I heard <i>him...</i>

10:53.194 --> 10:54.070
on TV.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.363
Well, he's Cyndee's therapist,

10:55.446 --> 10:56.906
<i>and I'm real confused.</i>

10:56.989 --> 10:59.367
Dr. Dave's show is different

10:59.450 --> 11:00.576
from my therapy.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.995
Cyndee, in your pre-interview,

11:03.079 --> 11:04.580
you said that you hate the man

11:04.664 --> 11:06.791
that kept you captive for 15 years

11:06.874 --> 11:08.918
but that you love coconut.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.509
Just something to think about.

11:16.592 --> 11:17.861
Of course I want to get reattached to him.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.345
He got the genitals!

11:19.428 --> 11:20.596
Ooh!

11:20.679 --> 11:22.890
Uh-oh!
Guys, guys.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.017
So you're gonna see someone now.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.937
No. No!

11:28.020 --> 11:29.939
- Stop running, Holly.
- No!

11:30.022 --> 11:31.690
- Let Tonku swallow you.
- No! No!

11:34.235 --> 11:35.528
Thomas, the audience has spoken.

11:35.611 --> 11:36.987
You are the worst singer.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.040
What the Helvetica Bold
did I just applaud at?

11:48.124 --> 11:49.917
<i>People go to therapy on TV now?</i>

11:50.000 --> 11:51.127
What's next,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.130
watching people H-U-M-P on your computer?

11:54.213 --> 11:55.756
It's called therapy-tainment, girl.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.819
It's a legitimate form of entertain-apy
that started while you were in the bunker.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.719
Are you even studying
the flash cards I made?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.721
Yes, but they're mostly about Tyrese.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.348
Well, Dr. Dave is a miracle worker.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.201
His episode about
getting out of your depression

12:06.225 --> 12:07.810
got me to flip my mattress.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.271
He changes lives, Kimstagram.

12:10.354 --> 12:13.607
Well, that's what I want for Cyndee.

12:13.691 --> 12:16.235
And obviously she listens to him.

12:16.318 --> 12:17.945
<i>Must be nice for Dr. Dave.</i>

12:18.028 --> 12:19.530
People listen to him,

12:19.613 --> 12:21.240
treat him with respect.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.176
They don't tell him
to poop in a cup up to a line

12:23.200 --> 12:26.162
and then get all mad and accuse him
of not following instructions.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.955
Excuse me, sir?

12:28.038 --> 12:29.748
"Sir"?

12:29.832 --> 12:31.542
I think he's talking to you.

12:31.625 --> 12:32.751
No, sir, you...

12:32.835 --> 12:33.961
the person.

12:34.044 --> 12:36.797
Oh, because I've only heard
the kind of "sir"

12:36.881 --> 12:38.132
that comes before

12:38.215 --> 12:40.342
"the store microwave
is for breakfast sandwiches only.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.511
Please remove your wet laundry and wigs."

12:42.595 --> 12:43.595
Why would you...

12:47.892 --> 12:49.310
<i>Titus, you still there?</i>

12:49.393 --> 12:50.769
I'm gonna have to call you back.

12:53.689 --> 12:54.607
Where were we?

12:54.690 --> 12:56.150
Something about me being a person.

12:56.233 --> 12:57.276
Say it again.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.777
Um, can you buy me movie tickets?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.404
It's rated R, and my dad is...

13:00.488 --> 13:03.032
- In jail.
- No, in Hong Kong for work.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.617
They have jails there.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.461
I just need you to buy the tickets
and take me and my friend in later.

13:07.495 --> 13:08.787
I have my dad's credit card.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.878
So you just have to see
<i>The Human Centipede 5:</i>

13:15.961 --> 13:17.046
<i>A Need for Pede?</i>

13:17.129 --> 13:19.632
In this one, he makes all the women
into a sports car.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.509
Tyler, when I was your age,

13:21.592 --> 13:23.093
a terrible movie was something like

13:23.177 --> 13:24.512
Britney Spears' <i>Crossroads,</i>

13:24.595 --> 13:26.680
and it was extraordinary.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.390
But this is simply garbage.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.560
Your father knows what he's talking about.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.312
And that's not all I know.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.074
This way, all the popcorn
gets nutrition on it.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.992
Huh, smart.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.410
That's right.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.703
I'm smart,

13:49.787 --> 13:51.580
like that Jennifer Aniston water.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.376
So we've covered popcorn,
pre-Federline Britney,

13:55.459 --> 13:58.212
and the appropriate reaction
to a broken escalator...

13:58.295 --> 14:01.090
Yell, "Who stole my wheelchair?"
and wait to be carried up.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.385
What else can I pour
into your little mind sponge?

14:04.468 --> 14:05.844
Well, uh...

14:05.928 --> 14:07.972
that other ticket is for a girl I like.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.057
Oh, I get it.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.559
Take her to an R-rated movie

14:11.642 --> 14:14.103
and she's all, "You're so grown up."

14:14.186 --> 14:18.065
And you're like, "Baby, your neck
is so thin and bumpless,"

14:18.148 --> 14:20.401
or whatever it is you straights
like about women.

14:20.484 --> 14:23.112
So do you think I'm dressed okay?

14:23.195 --> 14:24.780
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.490
You look perfect...

14:26.574 --> 14:28.826
for a bus ride to Atlantic City
on Christmas.

14:28.909 --> 14:30.452
First off, you need to put on a tie.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.222
Women like a little effort
but not too much.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.163
They hate that.

14:33.247 --> 14:34.748
They also hate trying on jeans,

14:34.832 --> 14:36.000
the word "moist,"

14:36.083 --> 14:37.644
and sitting at the table under the vent.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.461
But I don't actually own a tie.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.064
Can you take me shopping or something?

14:41.088 --> 14:44.008
Oh, you've made me and your mother
so happy.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.343
"Your mother" is what I call
your father's credit card.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.264
Ugh.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.558
I'm so hungry, I could eat a horse...

14:52.641 --> 14:54.268
out of hunger this time

14:54.351 --> 14:58.063
and not just 'cause I can't read
Portuguese.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.316
Pizza Rat!

15:00.399 --> 15:04.028
I knew the neighborhood would provide.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.237
Come here, girl.

15:05.321 --> 15:06.697
Come here.

15:06.780 --> 15:07.907
No, no, no, no, no.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.075
Bring me the pizza.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.954
Oh, come on, I introduced your parents.

15:14.038 --> 15:16.040
Pfff!

15:16.123 --> 15:19.126
You know, when my assistant told me
the second Mole Woman wanted to see me,

15:19.209 --> 15:22.504
at first, I thought it must be
another delightful prank

15:22.588 --> 15:24.173
played by my very dear friend,

15:24.256 --> 15:26.008
William Joel.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.344
It's Billy... Billy Joel.

15:28.427 --> 15:31.138
His friends call him William.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.806
Have a seat, please, Kimmy.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.353
Ah, what seems to be troubling you?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.479
Here, let me guess.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.482
Since the bunker,
you've been trying to gain control

15:41.565 --> 15:44.151
through countless serial sexual partners?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.195
Cereal what? No.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.990
I mean, yeah,
I've thought about Tony the Tiger.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.743
We meet at a provocative art opening...

15:52.826 --> 15:54.203
Okay, hang on right there.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.121
Ooh.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.307
Yeah, we could do a show about you.

15:57.331 --> 15:58.415
Oh, no. No, no, no.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.750
I don't want to be on TV.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.918
I'm here about Cyndee.

16:01.001 --> 16:01.835
Mm-hmm.

16:01.919 --> 16:04.314
But she would kill me if she knew
I was going behind her back.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.066
The only person
who's ever killed on this show

16:06.090 --> 16:08.842
is the hilarious Louie Anderson,
and that woman deserved it.

16:08.926 --> 16:09.926
Go on.

16:09.969 --> 16:12.429
Okay, you've got to get Cyndee
to change her life.

16:12.513 --> 16:14.181
Kimmy, I'm not a magician...

16:14.264 --> 16:15.140
during the week.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
But what I hear

16:17.434 --> 16:19.728
is that you feel responsible
for your friend?

16:20.938 --> 16:22.749
You don't have to take all that on,
my darling.

16:22.773 --> 16:23.774
Thank you.

16:23.857 --> 16:24.984
It's not fair.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.568
I've got my own me to be.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.652
Mm!

16:27.695 --> 16:29.089
I think you just named my next book.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.906
Ah, the cover, is a, uh...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.133
a bee climbing up a mountain.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.659
Now, look.

16:33.742 --> 16:34.910
Help me help Cyndee,

16:34.994 --> 16:38.205
and we'll make her the focus
of tomorrow's show.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.332
And since we tape five shows in a day,

16:40.416 --> 16:41.417
tomorrow's in 20 minutes.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.794
- What do you think?
- Tomorrow is today?

16:43.877 --> 16:45.879
In more ways than one.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.716
Kimmy, tell me everything.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.930
Now wrap the big-boned, healthy end

16:55.014 --> 16:57.391
around the scrawny little part

16:57.474 --> 17:00.769
that magazine covers
tell us ties should look like.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.189
Tuck it back through this bulgy part...

17:04.272 --> 17:05.482
that's what she said...

17:05.566 --> 17:09.361
and Viola Davis, you're done.

17:11.613 --> 17:14.657
You look like a young Morgan Freeman,
which many say never existed.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.367
I'm so nervous.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.304
How will I know if Vanessa
wants me to kiss her?

17:18.328 --> 17:20.955
Mm, in my experience,

17:21.040 --> 17:23.018
you wait so long that the girl
eventually kisses you

17:23.041 --> 17:24.792
and then yells, "What's your deal?"

17:24.877 --> 17:27.003
But in this case,
that movie's gonna scare her.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.213
She'll get all clingy.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.466
So you put your arm around her

17:30.549 --> 17:33.469
and look at her like
she's the only woman in the world.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.804
That's when it's time to put your mouth

17:35.888 --> 17:36.888
on her mouth,

17:36.930 --> 17:39.266
like <i>The Human Centipede's </i> Dr. Heiter

17:39.349 --> 17:41.101
puts mouths on butts.

17:41.185 --> 17:44.188
I think today is the first time
I've ever gotten advice about girls.

17:45.189 --> 17:46.791
Oh, and never buy them a cell phone case.

17:46.815 --> 17:48.901
They are very particular.
You will not be right.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.445
You know, the last time my dad

17:51.528 --> 17:53.405
had to take me to school,

17:53.489 --> 17:55.616
he tried to drop me off
at my old elementary school.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.619
I wish I had a dad like you, Titus.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.789
I wish I had a son like you, Tyler.

18:03.874 --> 18:05.334
I wish I had a son.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.169
I should have a baby.

18:08.420 --> 18:10.380
Then I'd feel like this all the time...

18:10.464 --> 18:12.716
respected, listened to,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.301
adored...

18:14.384 --> 18:16.470
everything a Titus should be.

18:16.553 --> 18:17.846
Cyndee was right.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.657
A baby is always a great idea!

18:19.681 --> 18:21.517
Titus, that's her.

18:37.074 --> 18:41.161
It was days before they realized
where I was,

18:41.245 --> 18:44.957
which is why I started a charity
that goes around the country

18:45.040 --> 18:47.543
throwing roast beef sandwiches down wells.

18:47.626 --> 18:48.460
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

18:50.129 --> 18:51.171
<i>That's, uh...</i>

18:51.255 --> 18:53.340
So I'll just watch on this puppy?

18:53.423 --> 18:55.676
What are you working with here, a Sears?

18:55.759 --> 18:57.386
Titus and I have a Sears.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.680
How's the tint? Nice.

18:59.763 --> 19:00.806
<i>Cyndee,</i>

19:00.889 --> 19:03.892
when we flew you to New York
on Delta Airlines...

19:03.976 --> 19:06.895
Delta: "We hate this as much as you do"...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.356
you said that you wanted closure.

19:09.439 --> 19:11.817
I said "overness" and "done-itude."

19:11.900 --> 19:14.403
- Is that the same thing?
- Sure it is.

19:14.486 --> 19:16.738
But it's not all about the past.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.383
How do you feel about the future, Cyndee?

19:18.407 --> 19:19.408
Real good.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.827
"So bright, I need shades" good.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.630
Yeah, that's so interesting,
because I heard

19:23.704 --> 19:25.497
that your future is so dim

19:25.581 --> 19:27.749
<i>that you need night vision goggles...</i>

19:27.833 --> 19:30.085
Donaldson's Night Vision Goggles:

19:30.169 --> 19:31.587
"Own the night, perv."

19:31.670 --> 19:33.338
Wait, who said that about me?

19:33.422 --> 19:34.506
I promised I wouldn't tell,

19:34.590 --> 19:37.217
but this Mole Woman... or man...

19:37.301 --> 19:38.886
<i>said, and I quote,</i>

19:38.969 --> 19:41.388
"Cyndee's not ready for a baby,

19:41.471 --> 19:42.681
<i>wherever they come from,</i>

19:42.764 --> 19:44.924
'cause there's no way
that what Titus told me is right.

19:44.975 --> 19:45.809
How could it fit?"

19:45.893 --> 19:47.728
Sun on a beach! What the fudge?

19:47.811 --> 19:49.521
Kimmy!

19:50.981 --> 19:52.191
- Schmidt!
- Hang on.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.151
I didn't say that,
and I certainly don't want

19:54.234 --> 19:56.820
some big fight on my stage,

19:56.904 --> 19:57.738
<i>because Kimmy...</i>

19:57.821 --> 19:58.989
Uh-oh, here she comes!

19:59.072 --> 20:01.158
Magic wall... No!

20:04.745 --> 20:06.747
What is wrong with you?

20:06.830 --> 20:09.625
You went behind my back
and lied to my front?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.418
You better stay away from my sides.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.253
Ooh!

20:13.337 --> 20:15.631
You think me and Brandon
having a baby is crazy?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.257
Look, can we do this in private?

20:17.341 --> 20:19.593
Guess what, Kimmy.
Gay guys can have babies.

20:19.676 --> 20:20.969
I saw it at the airport.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.638
They just come out Chinese!

20:22.721 --> 20:23.639
Ladies, ladies... Please, please.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.432
Let's not do something
that could go viral.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.515
#MoleFight.

20:26.558 --> 20:27.558
No, Cyndee.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.977
You shouldn't have a baby,

20:29.061 --> 20:30.103
because you're a baby!

20:30.187 --> 20:31.021
Why?

20:31.104 --> 20:32.439
Because I cry sometimes

20:32.522 --> 20:33.565
and laugh at keys

20:33.649 --> 20:35.651
and spit up milk a lot?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.070
I was gonna name my first kid after you!

20:38.153 --> 20:39.780
But now I wouldn't even name

20:39.863 --> 20:42.157
a bottom-half half kid after you!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.825
And that's where the butt is!

20:43.909 --> 20:45.269
- Ooh!
- Oh, snap!

20:45.327 --> 20:47.663
That "oh, snap" moment
was brought to you by

20:47.746 --> 20:49.623
Spine-Snap Possum Traps:

20:49.706 --> 20:50.706
"When you hear the snap,

20:50.749 --> 20:52.251
you got a possum to bury."

20:53.961 --> 20:55.587
I'm gonna freeze to death.

20:55.671 --> 20:59.049
I feel like I'm sitting under a vent.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.551
Oh, Meth-Head Charlie!

21:01.635 --> 21:04.513
You brought me all my stuff...

21:04.596 --> 21:07.724
my winter coat, my stereo,

21:07.808 --> 21:10.519
my copper pipes!

21:10.602 --> 21:12.938
You robbed me!

21:14.648 --> 21:16.441
Methadone H. Charles,

21:16.525 --> 21:18.568
you bring back my radiator

21:18.652 --> 21:20.237
this instant!

21:20.988 --> 21:23.365
<i>♪ I am a soda inventor ♪</i>

21:23.448 --> 21:26.618
<i>♪ Prepare your mouth
for a soda adventure ♪</i>

21:27.536 --> 21:29.121
Tyler, what happened?

21:29.204 --> 21:30.539
I hate you.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.707
I did everything you said.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.351
I put my arm around her
and looked at her eyeballs,

21:33.375 --> 21:35.015
and she goes, "You think this is a date?"

21:35.085 --> 21:36.896
She never even liked me,
and it's all your fault!

21:36.920 --> 21:38.380
And I wish I never met you!

21:38.463 --> 21:41.133
Tyler Middle Name Last Name,
I know you didn't mean that.

21:42.634 --> 21:43.802
Young man, you come back here

21:43.885 --> 21:45.029
and say something nice about me

21:45.053 --> 21:46.680
this instant!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.393
Look, you're mad at the wrong person.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.395
Why are you even still here?

21:53.478 --> 21:55.248
You think of a new way
to stab me in the back...

21:55.272 --> 21:57.107
maybe with a fork glued to a boomerang?

21:57.190 --> 22:00.110
You're the one who stabs yourself
in the back, Cyndee,

22:00.193 --> 22:02.070
with... I don't know... a sword

22:02.154 --> 22:03.780
that goes all the way around the world!

22:03.864 --> 22:06.116
Why can't you just support me?

22:06.199 --> 22:08.327
Nope, not interested.

22:08.410 --> 22:10.203
What? I'm not crying for you.

22:10.287 --> 22:11.580
I'm crying for me.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.249
Sometimes it feels good
to feel feelings, Kimmy.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.085
Brandon says the ancient Greeks
called it "catharsis,"

22:17.169 --> 22:20.088
and it's just one of the many ways
they were real smart about stuff.

22:20.172 --> 22:23.550
No, this is you letting another man
manipulate you.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.093
The Reverend made you cry.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.762
Can Man made you cry.

22:26.845 --> 22:29.848
Donna Maria wearing
that cardboard mustache made you cry.

22:29.931 --> 22:32.184
Don Mario,
the Spanish-language insult comic,

22:32.267 --> 22:33.435
was mean.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.687
I don't let other people
tell me how I feel.

22:35.771 --> 22:38.315
That's why I never cried in the bunker.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.317
Never?

22:40.400 --> 22:42.319
Not even when you were alone?

22:42.402 --> 22:43.945
- That's...
- That's nuts.

22:44.029 --> 22:47.157
Seriously, Kimmy, if you ever want
to come back on the show...

22:47.240 --> 22:48.825
I thought you were a good doctor.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.327
But you're a creep,

22:50.410 --> 22:52.621
like Doc Brown from <i>Back to the Future.</i>

22:52.704 --> 22:54.873
Why is he asking a 16-year-old boy

22:54.956 --> 22:57.042
to meet him alone in an empty parking lot

22:57.125 --> 22:58.376
with a video camera?

22:58.460 --> 22:59.336
Right.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.296
Cyndee, Cyndee...

23:01.379 --> 23:03.131
I know that was very difficult for you,

23:03.215 --> 23:06.968
but now that you've confronted
your greatest nemesis, Kimmy,

23:07.052 --> 23:08.720
I think you're finally ready

23:08.804 --> 23:11.556
to move forward and start a new life,

23:11.640 --> 23:13.517
which is why I want this Thursday's show,

23:13.600 --> 23:15.060
which tapes in 12 minutes,

23:15.143 --> 23:17.646
to be your dream wedding
to Brandon Yeagley,

23:17.729 --> 23:20.357
brought to you by all-new episodes

23:20.440 --> 23:23.151
of <i>American Horror Story: Ghost Bus!</i>

23:25.028 --> 23:26.113
Oh!

23:26.196 --> 23:28.949
- Yay!
- Not before the wedding!

23:29.032 --> 23:30.992
You know what? I tried.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.619
I'm not gonna be part of this.

23:32.702 --> 23:35.413
Good, 'cause this wedding's
gonna be real emotional.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.040
And I'm totally gonna cry.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.167
Yeah, I'm crying on the inside right now.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.128
Because we're not robots, Kimmy,

23:41.211 --> 23:42.254
unlike you.

23:42.337 --> 23:45.215
Oh, so my brain's a computer,

23:45.298 --> 23:46.338
I have a built-in jetpack,

23:46.383 --> 23:48.301
and my name stands for something cool,

23:48.385 --> 23:52.973
like "Killer Imagination Mega-Machine,
Ya heard"?

23:53.056 --> 23:54.391
Nice insult!

24:03.275 --> 24:04.442
If you're dead,

24:04.526 --> 24:07.279
may I have your hair for a wig I dreamed?

24:07.362 --> 24:08.362
Please.

24:08.405 --> 24:09.698
If anything's gonna kill me,

24:09.781 --> 24:11.867
it'll be my lover, Bobby Durst.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.244
Why did you never have children?

24:15.453 --> 24:19.666
Oh, I'm not a mom type.

24:19.749 --> 24:23.253
I guess I wanted to hold on to my freedom.

24:23.336 --> 24:24.754
To this day,

24:24.838 --> 24:26.339
if I see a raccoon,

24:26.423 --> 24:30.177
I can follow it,
see where it takes all that stuff,

24:30.260 --> 24:32.470
and then that's my stuff.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.723
Kids can make you feel like
you're king of the world,

24:34.806 --> 24:36.600
like Leonardo DiCaprio

24:36.683 --> 24:38.810
before chubs took over
the whole floating door.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.812
And then they turn on you for no reason,

24:40.896 --> 24:42.397
like me with Kate Winslet.

24:42.480 --> 24:45.150
You know, I do have a child...

24:45.233 --> 24:46.610
this neighborhood.

24:46.693 --> 24:47.986
Lame.

24:48.069 --> 24:49.321
I take care of it.

24:49.404 --> 24:51.948
I protect it.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.160
I'd do anything for it.

24:55.243 --> 24:57.287
But I was stupid to think

24:57.370 --> 24:59.581
I'd get anything back,

24:59.664 --> 25:01.333
'cause kids are selfish,

25:01.416 --> 25:03.293
and they take you for granted.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.253
And you love them anyway.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.923
That's what parenting is all about.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.966
You give and you give,

25:10.050 --> 25:12.177
and you end up cold, hungry,

25:12.260 --> 25:14.721
and handcuffed to a bulldozer.

25:15.972 --> 25:18.183
What if you still think
maybe it's worth it?

25:18.266 --> 25:20.977
Well, then you're a sucker.

25:21.061 --> 25:24.481
Hey, what's with all this kid talk?

25:24.564 --> 25:26.191
Mikey knock you up?

25:26.274 --> 25:27.525
No.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.152
We're being careful.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.613
It's just, after I ran away from Vonda,

25:31.696 --> 25:33.323
I thought my only chance for a family

25:33.406 --> 25:35.951
was a Klumps scenario.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.536
Now I'm 30-mumble.

25:38.620 --> 25:41.414
- I could get married.
- Hmm.

25:41.498 --> 25:42.707
I could have a kid.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.167
I know it would come out Chinese,

25:44.251 --> 25:46.711
but it'd still be a little Titus.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.130
The world could use more Tituses.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.091
The plural is Titi.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.013
Fine! Have a nice life, Cyndee!

25:57.097 --> 25:58.598
Good rid-dance.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.895
Now I can get back to focusing on me.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.146
I'll start with you, hands.

26:05.230 --> 26:06.439
How's it going?

26:06.523 --> 26:07.523
Nice!

26:09.109 --> 26:09.943
Aww...

26:10.026 --> 26:12.821
Cyndee, what happened to us?

26:15.156 --> 26:17.325
I can't just abandon her.

26:18.743 --> 26:19.786
Dang it.

26:19.869 --> 26:21.069
I've got to stop this wedding!

26:27.377 --> 26:29.462
Oh, Mole Two is back.

26:29.546 --> 26:31.214
Quick, get some makeup on her.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.938
Under the lights, she looks like
a glow-in-the-dark Happy Meal toy.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.802
Good, good!

26:35.885 --> 26:38.972
Are you ready to heal?

26:39.055 --> 26:40.181
Oh, my gosh.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.933
This is exactly what he wants

26:42.017 --> 26:43.810
for his dumb show.

26:43.893 --> 26:45.103
I'm not his puppet.

26:45.186 --> 26:49.149
<i>On today's show,
a Mole Woman wedding.</i>

26:52.027 --> 26:53.361
No.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.947
This is not how Cyndee Pokorny
gets married.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.620
But if I wreck her wedding,

27:02.704 --> 27:04.456
Cyndee will never talk to me again.

27:05.874 --> 27:08.335
No matter what I do, she's gone.

27:09.461 --> 27:11.504
Either way, I'll lose her forever.

27:13.757 --> 27:16.301
Um, as part of my vows,

27:16.384 --> 27:19.971
I'd like to ask again
if anyone objects to this union.

27:26.853 --> 27:29.064
Boy, you're lucky you have friends

27:29.147 --> 27:31.107
who know what you've been through.

27:31.191 --> 27:33.068
In the well, I was all alone,

27:33.151 --> 27:35.904
until they started
throwing down sandwiches.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.989
They were my friends.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.700
And then I ate them.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.160
I ate my friends.

27:42.243 --> 27:44.287
And the next time I saw them,
they had changed.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.205
Yeah, Debbie.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.915
Cyndee's special to me.

27:46.998 --> 27:48.500
But she's making a huge mistake,

27:48.583 --> 27:50.418
and there's nothing I can do.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.337
I hate this!

27:52.420 --> 27:54.381
I'm trapped!

27:54.464 --> 27:55.757
There's nothing I can do.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.051
I'm just...

27:58.134 --> 28:00.720
helpless and sad.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.265
And I want my Geena Davis.

28:09.646 --> 28:10.730
Kimmy?

28:10.814 --> 28:12.357
Are you crying?

28:13.358 --> 28:15.402
Because I want to help my friend

28:15.485 --> 28:17.404
and I can't help my friend.

28:17.487 --> 28:19.531
And I love my friend!

28:19.614 --> 28:21.825
You're crying for me?

28:24.744 --> 28:27.372
Fifteen years in the bunker
didn't make you cry,

28:27.455 --> 28:28.456
but this did?

28:28.540 --> 28:30.959
Because I care about you!

28:33.002 --> 28:34.838
Aww.

28:34.921 --> 28:37.507
If this wedding
is making my friend Kimmy cry,

28:37.590 --> 28:39.384
then I'm not getting married.

28:42.887 --> 28:44.556
Thank you, Kimmy!

28:44.639 --> 28:46.558
Oh, God, thank you!

28:46.641 --> 28:48.268
Ladies and gentlemen,

28:48.351 --> 28:50.603
this is why

28:50.687 --> 28:52.439
I went to pharmacy school.

28:57.819 --> 28:58.820
Yes!

29:01.656 --> 29:03.241
<i>Next week on </i> Dr. Dave:

29:03.324 --> 29:06.202
<i>Does your raccoon have OCD?
Maybe?!</i>

30:14.896 --> 30:16.856

- Good night!</i>
