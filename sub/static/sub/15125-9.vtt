WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:04.338
Whoo!

00:04.372 --> 00:05.573
* Here we go

00:05.606 --> 00:08.709
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:10.211 --> 00:11.645
No, it's not
in the checkers.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.314
Maybe it's in
the backgammon?

00:13.347 --> 00:15.149
That makes no sense.
Check the Snakes and Ladders.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.185
I did. It's all Dad's
business receipts.

00:17.218 --> 00:19.187
Well, you must've put it
back in the wrong game,

00:19.220 --> 00:21.722
because I always keep it
in the checkers box.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.257
This might be crazy talk,

00:23.291 --> 00:25.359
but why wouldn't you keep
Hope's birth certificate

00:25.393 --> 00:26.894
in the file cabinet?

00:26.927 --> 00:28.196
That's where
we lock up

00:28.229 --> 00:29.997
all the bite-sized
board game pieces

00:30.030 --> 00:31.732
so Maw Maw doesn't
mistake 'em for treats.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.067
Of course.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.668
Maybe you put it in
the Chinese checkers

00:34.702 --> 00:35.903
instead of
the regular checkers.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.271
Nope.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.607
Chinese checkers is where
Maw Maw's papers go.

00:39.640 --> 00:41.542
Because,
like Maw Maw,

00:41.575 --> 00:42.610
the Chinese
checkers game

00:42.643 --> 00:43.911
has lost most
of its marbles.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.347
That makes a frightening
amount of sense.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.915
Found it!

00:47.948 --> 00:49.517
That's right!
I put it in Clue,

00:49.550 --> 00:50.951
because her mother
beat someone to death

00:50.984 --> 00:52.019
with a
candlestick.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.387
(panting)

00:53.421 --> 00:54.422
They're all dead!

00:54.455 --> 00:55.456
They're dead!

00:55.489 --> 00:56.790
It was horrible!

00:56.824 --> 00:58.559
Who's dead?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.794
Besides everyone
I've ever loved?

01:00.828 --> 01:02.130
Just take a deep breath, Burt.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.631
Start from the beginning.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.866
I was trimming some
bushes at the Ericksons'--

01:05.899 --> 01:07.401
you know, the rich people
with the big house

01:07.435 --> 01:08.436
down by the river?

01:08.469 --> 01:10.904
(imitating electric guitar)

01:10.938 --> 01:13.374
(whistling)

01:13.407 --> 01:16.210
No!

01:16.244 --> 01:17.478
I can't save all of you,

01:17.511 --> 01:19.079
but I can save some of you!

01:19.113 --> 01:21.649
Which ones of you
are women and children?

01:23.284 --> 01:25.619
Ah... you'll have to do, buddy.

01:25.653 --> 01:28.122
One, two, one, two...

01:28.156 --> 01:29.423
(screams, sobs)

01:29.457 --> 01:31.225
I'm trying to help you!

01:31.259 --> 01:33.927
I'm sure they're
all up in bee heaven,

01:33.961 --> 01:36.664
where the streets
are lined with pollen

01:36.697 --> 01:38.566
and all the little bees
get their wings.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.402
Or their... extra wings,
or something.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.305
I hate those
black and yellow bastards.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.573
Invading our
neighborhood,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.941
scaring the heck
out of everybody...

01:49.009 --> 01:50.444
We were talking
about bees, right?

01:51.212 --> 01:52.646
I know it's hard, Burt,

01:52.680 --> 01:54.182
but death is a part of life.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.250
Oh, you guys
don't understand.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.085
Without bees,
there's no flowers.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.287
No flowers, no gardeners.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.189
No gardeners, no job.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.957
And one other thing:
no bees,

02:03.991 --> 02:06.327
all life on Earth
will cease to exist.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.828
This could be great news.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.763
You're happy about
all the bees dying?

02:09.797 --> 02:11.632
No, that environmental group
that I'm part of,

02:11.665 --> 02:13.133
they think that
the kazoo factory

02:13.167 --> 02:14.968
has been dumping
chemicals into the river.

02:15.002 --> 02:17.271
And if they hear about
all these bees dying,

02:17.305 --> 02:18.839
I'm sure they're gonna
want to start a protest.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.341
You should definitely
do a protest.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.042
Paint signs, chain
yourself to each other,

02:22.075 --> 02:23.477
Even if it takes all day

02:23.511 --> 02:25.879
marching around in
the hot, blazing sun.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.048
God, I'm so glad
you're into this.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.884
We should get started.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.553
Wait...

02:32.586 --> 02:33.721
I have to go with you?

02:33.754 --> 02:34.722
(door opens)

02:34.755 --> 02:35.889
(moans)

02:37.157 --> 02:38.859
Good for them,
with their protest.

02:38.892 --> 02:41.195
I wish we could do something
that would actually work.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.163
We should write a letter
to our senator.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.833
Do you know
who that is?
No. Do you?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.000
BURT:
I seem to recall

02:47.034 --> 02:48.369
he has gray hair

02:48.402 --> 02:49.670
and he points
with his thumb.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.339
But other than that,
I'm drawing a blank.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.973
We could just go
down to that company

02:53.006 --> 02:54.007
and complain.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.309
I don't know, Virginia.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.977
What can two little
people like us do

02:57.010 --> 02:58.579
against a giant
kazoo conglomeration?

02:58.612 --> 03:00.348
We can give 'em
a piece of our minds.

03:00.381 --> 03:01.849
Remember when
you went down

03:01.882 --> 03:03.517
to the video store
'cause you wanted to return

03:03.551 --> 03:05.353
Police Academy 5:
Assignment: Miami Beach?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.020
Yeah, they didn't
want that video back,

03:07.054 --> 03:08.656
but I wouldn't take no
for an answer.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.724
But they did take it back.

03:10.758 --> 03:11.892
Even though the video store

03:11.925 --> 03:13.093
turned into an ice cream parlor.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.728
I was so sick of
watching that movie.

03:14.762 --> 03:17.531
No, the point is, Burt,
you convinced them.

03:17.565 --> 03:18.732
You're right.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.167
If a rag-tag bunch
of police recruits

03:20.200 --> 03:21.835
can take down a ring
of jewelry thieves...

03:21.869 --> 03:23.771
In a fifth sequel
that's so bad

03:23.804 --> 03:25.839
even Steve Guttenberg
refused to be in it...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.242
Then we could stand up
to a kazoo factory!

03:32.112 --> 03:34.248
All right, just remember,
Burt, be forceful.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.183
Ask their name,
look 'em in the eye,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.351
and stick
your chest out.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.352
I hope this works.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.453
Oh, trust me,
it will.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.854
I read it on
the back flap of

03:40.888 --> 03:42.256
How to Win Friends
and Influence People.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.693
Excuse me,
what's your name?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.395
Kelly.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.729
Well, Kelly,

03:48.762 --> 03:50.264
we have some serious
issues to discuss

03:50.298 --> 03:51.732
with how your company
conducts its business.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.734
Yes, we do, Kelly.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.436
I'm just in Personnel.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.937
You're gonna want
to talk to Mr. Gunderson.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.539
He's the top guy
around here.

03:58.572 --> 03:59.773
Around the corner,

03:59.807 --> 04:00.941
past the second set
of elevators.

04:00.974 --> 04:02.075
Okay.

04:02.109 --> 04:05.012
Have a nice day.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.948
Mr. Gunderson...

04:07.981 --> 04:09.283
We need to talk
to you about...

04:09.317 --> 04:10.951
Who the hell are you?

04:10.984 --> 04:12.953
Kelly from Personnel
sent us.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.055
Right.
The new hires.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.390
You're early, I like that.

04:16.424 --> 04:18.125
What fantastic
résumés.

04:18.158 --> 04:19.827
Uh... U. Penn?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.261
I pen, I pencil.

04:21.295 --> 04:22.563
Whatever it takes.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.765
I love the Ivy League
sense of humor.

04:24.798 --> 04:25.966
I'm gonna grab your key cards

04:25.999 --> 04:27.100
and we'll get you started.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.303
Thanks. Glad
to be here!

04:29.337 --> 04:30.771
(whispers):
What the hell are you doing?

04:30.804 --> 04:32.072
We can infiltrate the hive.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.074
Burt, we will
never pull this off.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.576
I used to
clean offices

04:35.609 --> 04:37.511
like this--
these people went to college.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.179
We just want to get
a little dirt.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.981
I don't want to retire here
and get a golden kazoo.

04:41.014 --> 04:44.618
Here are your key cards, and
welcome to Amalgamated Kazoo.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.688
Thank you. Amalgamating
kazoos has been

04:47.721 --> 04:50.157
a lifetime dream of mine.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.930
Uh, do you know if
Mr. Gunderson is available?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.332
Oh, you must be
the new hires.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.767
Yeah.
Hi.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.335
I'm Kelly
from Personnel.

05:01.369 --> 05:04.472
Uh, those positions have
been filled. I'm sorry.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.649
Mom and Dad were
inside the kazoo factory

05:15.683 --> 05:18.051
trying to uncover the buzz
about the dead bees.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.353
VIRGINIA:
Wow.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.389
All this work
for kazoos?

05:21.422 --> 05:25.058
Can you imagine what
a harmonica company
must look like?

05:25.092 --> 05:26.460
Time to get to work.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.462
These are the office
protocol manuals.

05:28.496 --> 05:31.064
Walk with me. They cover
the rules and the regs,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.233
grievance procedures,
sexual harassment,

05:33.266 --> 05:36.003
workers comp, optical,
dental and COBRA.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.338
Snakes!
Karen Anderson,

05:38.372 --> 05:40.140
advertising.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.909
Gary Dilford, product testing.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.745
(kazoos buzzing)

05:44.778 --> 05:46.380
(quacks)

05:46.414 --> 05:47.748
Wayne Hill,
customer service.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.518
Have you tried
blowing in the other end?

05:50.551 --> 05:53.421
And this is your cubicle.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.823
So, you'll have
until 1300 hours to set up

05:55.856 --> 05:57.324
your voice mail
and e-mail accounts,

05:57.357 --> 05:58.692
and I'll see you then.

05:58.726 --> 06:02.730
1300 hours
to set up voice mail?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.364
That sounds pretty
complicated.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.600
I knew we'd
be in over our heads.

06:06.634 --> 06:08.035
We're gonna get caught.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.070
He's gone!

06:10.103 --> 06:11.739
(clapping, whooping, whistling)

06:11.772 --> 06:13.240
What just happened?

06:13.273 --> 06:15.609
Oh, if we don't look busy
when Gunderson's around,

06:15.643 --> 06:17.244
he thinks
we're not trying.

06:17.277 --> 06:19.179
I'm, uh, here to set up
your computers.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.581
I'm Candy from I.T.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.052
(quietly): See? I told you
they'd look down on us.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.087
Even the computer lady
thinks we're so stupid

06:27.120 --> 06:29.089
she needs to spell
out the word "it."

06:29.122 --> 06:31.024
I'm gonna snoop around
for some dirt.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.694
Just hurry up-- the sooner
we get out of here, the better.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.896
*

06:45.939 --> 06:47.641
(hinges squeak)

06:53.681 --> 06:55.549
(beep)

06:55.583 --> 06:57.751
(copier whirring)

07:00.153 --> 07:01.154
(beeping)

07:01.188 --> 07:03.657
(quietly):
Oh, no!

07:03.691 --> 07:05.826
Oh, no!

07:05.859 --> 07:08.261
(gasping)

07:09.162 --> 07:11.331
*

07:16.136 --> 07:18.138
(grunting)

07:22.510 --> 07:24.011
Hey! New guy!

07:24.044 --> 07:25.445
Buy you a drink?

07:25.479 --> 07:26.647
(chuckles)

07:26.680 --> 07:28.582
How is your first day going?
Great.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.818
Except I can't seem
to find the copier room.

07:30.851 --> 07:31.919
I've never
seen it.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.854
Never been there.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.360
So, I could just name these
files whatever I want, like...

07:40.393 --> 07:43.096
"Parcheesi" or "checkers"
or "backgammon"?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.699
Yeah, I guess.
But most people name them, like,

07:45.733 --> 07:48.502
"accounts payable"
or "customer contacts."

07:48.536 --> 07:50.103
Those aren't
fun board game names.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.271
It's based

07:51.304 --> 07:52.673
on a system I use at home.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.708
Clever. It's nice
to meet someone else

07:54.742 --> 07:56.810
who's smart and hot.
(clicks tongue)

08:00.013 --> 08:01.214
(gasps):
Oh!

08:01.248 --> 08:03.617
(exhales)
Did you find anything?

08:03.651 --> 08:06.554
Yeah. People around here
love free water.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.322
And there's no way
to put these cups down.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.867
Okay, so, like I said
in the e-mail blast,

08:19.900 --> 08:22.636
it looks like we may
finally have a breakthrough

08:22.670 --> 08:25.372
in our fight to save
the bees of Natesville.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.807
(low, excited chatter)

08:26.840 --> 08:28.175
Does anybody have any questions?

08:29.577 --> 08:32.880
Does anyone feel like
having their spouse there

08:32.913 --> 08:35.015
would be a distraction?

08:35.048 --> 08:37.050
OTHERS:
No. Mm-mm. Nope.

08:37.084 --> 08:38.518
Great.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.555
This is going to be
a peaceful protest.

08:41.589 --> 08:44.024
We will not be threatening cops
or throwing bricks.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.193
We get...

08:51.064 --> 08:54.034
Drastic situations
call for drastic measures.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.870
I, for one, am prepared
to put on a bee costume
and chant profanity.

08:56.904 --> 08:58.872
I may use the "D" word.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.908
And if pushed, the "H" word.

09:00.941 --> 09:04.077
See, guys, this is exaclty
the attitude that we need

09:04.111 --> 09:06.947
if we are going to close down
Amalgamated Kazoo.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.382
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell!

09:09.416 --> 09:11.919
No one ever said a damn thing
about Amalgamated Kazoo!

09:11.952 --> 09:13.787
We can't shut them down--

09:13.821 --> 09:15.856
they make the best kazoos
in the world.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.358
Those are the only kazoos
our jazz quartet,

09:18.391 --> 09:20.527
Jazzoo, ever uses.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.964
*

09:23.997 --> 09:26.867
Come on, Barney,
this is very important.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.535
Well, I wouldn't
expect someone

09:28.568 --> 09:30.771
who's never made
the wax paper dance
to understand.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.706
Yeah. You can
have my kazoo

09:32.740 --> 09:35.909
when you pry it from
my cold, chapped lips.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.081
Does anyone else here have an
unnatural attachment to kazoos?

09:42.315 --> 09:43.951
Where have you guys
been all day?

09:43.984 --> 09:45.886
We have been trying
to call you.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.055
We accidentally got a job
at the bee-killing place.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.323
What?! You guys are
siding with the enemy?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.993
No, no! We are
deep undercover.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.295
I spent all day learning
how to use the computer.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.396
You know
how you were

09:56.429 --> 09:57.631
giving me such a hard time

09:57.665 --> 09:59.132
about my board game
filing system?

09:59.166 --> 10:00.300
Turns out...

10:00.333 --> 10:03.003
that's exactly
how computers work.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.405
Even the "it" girl
said I was smart.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.074
Oh, Breaking Bad
marathon's about to start.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.976
JIMMY:
What, you guys are
just gonna watch TV?

10:09.009 --> 10:10.477
Wh-What about
the bees?

10:10.510 --> 10:12.579
This is for the bees.
We have to watch it

10:12.612 --> 10:14.347
to keep up
with the water cooler crowd.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.684
Water cooler's the nerve center
of the whole office.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.518
First they recap last
night's cable TV,

10:18.551 --> 10:20.353
then they plunge
right into office gossip.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.656
So, our ticket
into this elite circle

10:22.690 --> 10:23.957
is knowing
what's going on

10:23.991 --> 10:25.826
with this crystal math teacher.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.761
Which one's Walt?
Which one's Jesse?

10:27.795 --> 10:29.797
Walt is the schoolteacher-

10:29.830 --> 10:31.665
slash meth cook.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.467
And Jesse is
his stoner assistant.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.437
What?

10:37.470 --> 10:39.372
While you guys
are running around town

10:39.406 --> 10:43.977
doing silly crap every week,
I'm watching quality television.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.380
Everybody says the paradigm

10:47.414 --> 10:50.283
is that Walt is
the modern-day Scarface,

10:50.317 --> 10:51.785
but in a
deeper sense,

10:51.819 --> 10:54.621
I think he represents
the evil that resides

10:54.654 --> 10:56.690
in all of us.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.692
(laughing):
How about...

10:58.726 --> 11:01.194
when that ATM fell
on that meth lady?

11:01.228 --> 11:02.395
(Burt laughs)

11:02.429 --> 11:05.298
I was like, "What?
Science, bitch!"

11:05.332 --> 11:06.734
(all laugh)

11:06.767 --> 11:08.368
Listen up, everyone.

11:08.401 --> 11:10.170
It's come to my attention that
there are two employees

11:10.203 --> 11:11.972
that have been hiding
something from us.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.042
Now, I didn't want to out them
until I had proof from HR,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.677
but Karen and Gary
are getting married!

11:17.711 --> 11:19.379
GARY:
Ah!

11:19.412 --> 11:22.182
Thanks, gang. I've got some
other great news...

11:22.215 --> 11:25.018
is that Karen isn't getting fat.
She's pregnant!

11:25.052 --> 11:27.087
Oh-ho-ho.
Yeah. And I am

11:27.120 --> 11:30.257
taking us all out to Sombrero
Junction to celebrate.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.659
Oh, my God, I've always wanted
to go to Sombrero Junction!

11:32.692 --> 11:35.028
Yeah! It's like all the fun
of Mexico without worrying

11:35.062 --> 11:36.529
about getting
your head cut off.

11:36.563 --> 11:37.397
(all laugh)

11:37.430 --> 11:40.067
(laughs)
Just great.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.769
But you know what?
With everyone gone,

11:41.802 --> 11:43.904
it might be the perfect chance
for us to look around.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.773
Yeah, you're right, it would.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.074
If we find what we need tonight,

11:47.107 --> 11:48.608
we don't have to come back
tomorrow.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.677
Finding evidence is the reason
we came here.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.880
But if they're drinking...

11:52.913 --> 11:55.682
they might loosen up
and spill some company secrets.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.685
And if we go out,
we can buy them shots,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.053
then tomorrow
they'll be hung over

12:00.087 --> 12:02.022
and sloppy
with incriminating documents.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.424
We might never get another
chance to go out with them.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.027
I mean, how often do office
employees go to happy hour

12:07.060 --> 12:08.095
at nearby Mexican restaurants?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.562
I've never heard of it.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.264
It's like, God's practically
begging us to go.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.565
It's the responsible thing
to do.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.734
Yeah.
Hey, wait for us!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.073
(Virginia laughs)

12:22.309 --> 12:25.378
Where were you guys?!
We were supposed to meet
three hours ago to talk about

12:25.412 --> 12:27.414
what evidence you guys
might have found,

12:27.447 --> 12:29.549
and our protest is tomorrow.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.219
And where did you get
those cool hats?

12:32.252 --> 12:35.388
We were at
Sombrero Junction

12:35.422 --> 12:40.093
with our professional colleagues
having a business dinner.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.628
Well, you didn't get
any information?

12:41.661 --> 12:43.763
Oh, we got some information.

12:43.797 --> 12:47.267
You're not gonna believe
what's going on in that place.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.202
Brad in accounting...

12:50.337 --> 12:51.671
is sleeping with Sarah
from H.R.

12:51.704 --> 12:54.741
H.R. obviously stands for
"Home Wrecker"!

12:54.774 --> 12:56.844
Plus Jeff with a "J"
steals pens

12:56.877 --> 12:59.012
and Geoff with a "G"
hates kazoos.

12:59.046 --> 13:00.480
Who's Geoff with a "G"?

13:00.513 --> 13:01.514
Do you mean Ge-off?

13:01.548 --> 13:03.150
You guys!

13:03.183 --> 13:05.018
You were supposed to go in there
and get the goods

13:05.052 --> 13:07.287
on the company, and instead
all you're coming back with

13:07.320 --> 13:08.421
is drunk-person office gossip.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.323
No!

13:10.357 --> 13:12.492
We came back with the trust
of our coworkers.

13:12.525 --> 13:15.128
So tomorrow,
we can go in there

13:15.162 --> 13:17.797
and get them to spill the beans!

13:17.831 --> 13:18.866
I spilled the beans.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.168
They told me
the plate was hot.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.303
(laughs) I thought
they meant spicy!

13:23.336 --> 13:25.672
So you just worry about
your protest tomorrow, okay?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.240
Trust us.

13:28.741 --> 13:32.045
We are gonna take care
of everything from the inside.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.314
We'd probably have a lot more
confidence in you

13:34.347 --> 13:36.183
if you both weren't wearing
flashing sombreros.

13:36.216 --> 13:40.820
Hey! We're immersing ourselves
in a corporate culture, okay?

13:40.854 --> 13:44.324
So tomorrow I'm gonna learn how
to spread sheets

13:44.357 --> 13:46.526
while I'm sitting on
an exercise ball.

13:46.559 --> 13:51.364
Oh, Lord, I passed out and
woke up in Tijuana again.

13:51.398 --> 13:55.835
¿Donde esta embassy,
por favor? Embassy?

13:55.869 --> 13:57.670
Yee-haw!

13:58.771 --> 14:01.308
ALL:
Save the bees! Save the bees!

14:01.341 --> 14:05.245
Murderers!
Environmental terrorists!

14:05.278 --> 14:07.347
Save the bees!
This is going really well.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.716
Yeah, all that screaming
has to work.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.019
I can't imagine
that they're not
annoyed by this.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.554
But you really believe
that overregulating business

14:14.587 --> 14:16.856
won't lead
to the destruction of jobs

14:16.890 --> 14:19.192
and the end of capitalism?

14:19.226 --> 14:20.027
Yes.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.828
I'm so sick of you

14:21.861 --> 14:23.563
and your liberal agenda.
(scoffs)

14:23.596 --> 14:24.531
Ooh!

14:24.564 --> 14:25.498
Save the environment!

14:25.532 --> 14:26.766
Fascist pigs!

14:26.799 --> 14:28.368
Hey, get some really good stuff
today.

14:28.401 --> 14:29.702
Don't worry, I'm on it.

14:29.736 --> 14:31.704
We're just trying
to make a decent living,

14:31.738 --> 14:32.906
you dirty liberals!

14:32.940 --> 14:35.075
Yeah. Yeah, get a job, losers!

14:35.108 --> 14:36.709
(whispers):
See you at dinner tonight.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.211
(whispers):
You're destroying
the environment.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.612
(loudly):
I love you guys!

14:39.646 --> 14:40.847
Uh, not!

14:40.880 --> 14:42.849
Bee killers!

14:42.882 --> 14:44.251
Can you believe that protest?

14:44.284 --> 14:45.585
What a bunch of loons.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.587
Ge-off couldn't even
get out of his car.

14:47.620 --> 14:48.855
I can't figure out
why they're here.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.290
Maybe because we dump a lot

14:50.323 --> 14:52.092
of toxic waste in the river.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.694
It'd be hilarious
if that killed a ton of bees.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.429
(chuckling)

14:58.598 --> 15:00.533
Anybody?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.401
Anything?

15:01.434 --> 15:02.769
Nothing?

15:02.802 --> 15:04.071
Hey, Burt.

15:05.672 --> 15:07.607
The "it" girl just taught me
how to do a spreadsheet program

15:07.640 --> 15:10.410
and I Excel at it.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.213
If you understood computers
the way I do,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.381
that would've been hysterical.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.249
Oh, I got it.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.318
(quietly):
Hey, I was just talking
about the toxic waste thing.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.453
It looked like they had no idea
what I was talking about.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.589
It's no hurry. After lunch,
Candy's gonna show me

15:22.622 --> 15:24.157
something called
a "right click."

15:24.191 --> 15:26.293
Apparently I've been
clicking wrong this entire time.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.827
I'm starting to think
Sabrina might've been wrong

15:27.860 --> 15:29.029
about this place.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.931
Oh, good.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.000
I need your help.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.334
Those protesters
outside

15:34.367 --> 15:35.835
are making me nervous.

15:35.868 --> 15:38.205
You two shred these,
ASAP.

15:43.843 --> 15:46.646
(whistling)

15:52.352 --> 15:54.821
I think this is the evidence
Sabrina was talking about.

15:54.854 --> 15:56.523
We can't shred this.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.857
How are we gonna get
a whole box out of here?

15:57.890 --> 15:59.859
Oh...
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.329
When you're done with those,
you can start on these.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.464
These are the most sensitive.

16:06.566 --> 16:09.802
ALL (chanting):
Save the bees! Save the bees!

16:09.836 --> 16:11.171
Sabrina?

16:11.204 --> 16:13.973
Uh, can I not carry
this sign anymore?

16:14.007 --> 16:15.942
Maybe you should take a turn
in the bee suit.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.144
(buzzing)

16:17.177 --> 16:18.678
What is that noise?

16:18.711 --> 16:21.981
Yeah, it's like a...
like a buzz or a-a humming.

16:22.015 --> 16:24.184
Oh, my God. Jimmy, look.

16:24.217 --> 16:28.121
(playing "The Battle Hymn
of the Republic ")

16:28.155 --> 16:30.157
Hey, guys,
what are you doing?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.792
Look, we have a right
to protest.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.661
And we have the right
to play sweet music

16:34.694 --> 16:36.829
on American-made kazoos.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.698
Oh, please. You guys don't want
to play music.

16:38.731 --> 16:40.700
You're just trying
to help this company

16:40.733 --> 16:43.203
that's gonna destroy the planet
that we leave our children.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.637
Spoiler alert.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.339
I don't have children.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.875
We're here to protest
your protest.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.977
They can do that?
Yes.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.645
Stupid free country.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.681
But you know what? We don't have
to make it easy for them.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.249
Give me your sign.

16:56.283 --> 16:59.018
Bees are people, too!

16:59.052 --> 17:02.422
("Battle Hymn of the Republic"
continues)
OTHERS: Bees are people, too!

17:02.455 --> 17:06.859
Shove your poison up your kazoo!

17:08.061 --> 17:10.697
Bees...
OTHERS:
Bees are people, too!

17:10.730 --> 17:15.868
Shove your poison up your kazoo!

17:20.740 --> 17:22.342
All right...

17:22.375 --> 17:25.845
Yet another useless invoice
that smells like cinnamon.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.281
Excuse me for making
a bold deodorant choice.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.850
I like it. It's like sleeping
next to a snickerdoodle.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.552
Wait a second.
I think I found something.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.555
"Waste disposal procedure.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.290
Must be dumped in the..."

17:37.324 --> 17:39.058
We need the second page.

17:39.092 --> 17:41.228
(mutters)

17:48.735 --> 17:52.605
Well, it's not here.
How can it not be here?

17:52.639 --> 17:54.874
Maybe they have other copies
of it hidden somewhere else.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.075
I bet they do.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.645
Candyland.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.080
That's what Candy the "it" girl
calls the backup servers.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.057
See the file path
in the footnote?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.625
Tells you where it is
in the network.

18:12.659 --> 18:17.330
So I can log in from here
using the VPN.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.933
It's like someone put
the document inside Parcheesi,

18:20.967 --> 18:21.768
which is inside

18:21.801 --> 18:22.835
Snakes and Ladders,

18:22.869 --> 18:24.937
which is inside the Internet.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.607
Nothing.

18:27.640 --> 18:29.609
(groans)
Can't find it anywhere.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.445
Well, Virginia, guess it's back
to the drawing board.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.080
That's the bar next
to Sombrero Junction

18:34.113 --> 18:35.848
where the gang hangs out.

18:35.882 --> 18:38.151
Look, if that Gunderson guy had
you shred all those documents

18:38.185 --> 18:40.253
I'm sure he deleted
all the files, too.

18:40.287 --> 18:43.256
I feel kind of silly thinking
we could make a big corporation

18:43.290 --> 18:45.024
stop polluting.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.260
Maybe it'll make us feel better
if we throw all that trash

18:47.294 --> 18:48.261
in a landfill.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.696
I got it!

18:49.729 --> 18:51.198
I've been a maid long enough
to know

18:51.231 --> 18:53.533
there's two things
powerful people never do:

18:53.566 --> 18:57.304
notice spare change is missing
and take out the trash.

18:57.337 --> 18:59.472
(keys clacking)

19:01.341 --> 19:02.209
There it is!

19:02.242 --> 19:03.476
Oh!

19:03.510 --> 19:05.044
Oh, my God.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.180
They've been dumping
in the river every time it rains

19:07.214 --> 19:08.848
to cover their tracks.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.118
And there you go.
Your friend Gunderson signed it.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.620
Damn you, Gunderson.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.054
You're gonna be the first
one to betray our race

19:15.087 --> 19:16.623
when the apes take over.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.391
Which is bound to happen now
that the bees are gone.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.527
Well, hey, don't worry.
This is exactly what we need

19:20.560 --> 19:21.861
to close down
the factory.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.296
Close down the factory?

19:23.330 --> 19:25.232
Can't we just get 'em
to stop dumping chemicals?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.234
Yeah, we don't want our friends
to lose their jobs.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.303
Look, you guys, these people
are knowingly dumping chemicals

19:30.337 --> 19:32.672
into a river-- they have
to be shut down.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.040
Wait.

19:34.073 --> 19:35.742
What if we found a memo

19:35.775 --> 19:39.212
that said they didn't do it
knowingly?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.150
This is Dave Davidson
with a Channel 3 exclusive.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.854
It's a dirty story
about dirty water.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.822
We are the
employees responsible

19:49.856 --> 19:52.158
for dumping toxins in
the Natesville River.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.362
But we didn't know
we were doing anything wrong.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.697
The memo said, "Why don't
you just dump the waste

19:57.730 --> 20:01.368
in the river? Semicolon
right parentheses."

20:01.401 --> 20:03.403
But we-we were
new to office work

20:03.436 --> 20:06.739
and hadn't really gotten
down the technical jargon.

20:06.773 --> 20:10.109
Now if we got that message,
we'd probably "LOL."

20:10.142 --> 20:13.380
We really feel
colon left parentheses.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.383
That means we're sad.

20:16.416 --> 20:20.086
Amalgamated Kazoo has fired
the two employees responsible,

20:20.119 --> 20:22.755
yet no criminal charges
were filed

20:22.789 --> 20:25.592
as the state deemed it
an act of idiocy

20:25.625 --> 20:28.194
rather than a crime of malice.

20:28.227 --> 20:31.698
The board of directors also came
down hard on the man responsible

20:31.731 --> 20:34.567
for hiring the two idiots
in the first place.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.803
This is Dave Davidson,
reporting.

20:36.836 --> 20:40.640
And now back to Sandy Sanderson
with Tuesday's Puppy.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.008
Sandy?

20:42.909 --> 20:45.478
You did it.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.547
You guys did what my
environmental group

20:47.580 --> 20:48.715
could never do,

20:48.748 --> 20:49.716
something.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.250
It feels kind of good.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.886
On the downside, we look
like idiots on the news.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.755
Everybody looks like idiots
on the news.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.291
Yeah, but in a week some fat kid
will get stuck in a water slide

20:58.325 --> 20:59.992
and everybody will forget all
about you.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.128
You're right. That's what
finally got Iraq off the news.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.464
Very impressive
how you planted backdated memos

21:04.497 --> 21:05.965
on a corporate server, Virginia.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.935
Yeah, I guess I'm kind
of an "it" girl now, too.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.236
Maybe later
you could help me, uh,

21:10.269 --> 21:11.304
get a picture off the Internet?

21:11.338 --> 21:12.639
Word to the wise:

21:12.672 --> 21:14.073
never let anyone photograph you

21:14.106 --> 21:15.942
while you're yodeling
and juggling cucumbers.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.745
Well, I'm gonna miss working
at that office.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.947
But we brought
the best part home.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.451
(grunts)

21:24.484 --> 21:26.953
So, did you guys see
Downton Abbey last night?

21:27.887 --> 21:29.689
That Dowager Countess,

21:29.722 --> 21:32.291
she's spinning a dangerous web.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.795
