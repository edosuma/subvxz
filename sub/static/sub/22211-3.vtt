WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:02.967
How will we be remembered?

00:02.969 --> 00:05.796
Will it be for saving the world twice?

00:05.799 --> 00:09.063
Nope, we're the team who broke time.

00:09.065 --> 00:12.399
That's right, history
has been torn to shreds,

00:12.401 --> 00:14.201
which means it's up to us

00:14.203 --> 00:17.148
to put it back together
again piece by piece,

00:17.151 --> 00:19.373
fixing these so-called anachronisms

00:19.375 --> 00:21.142
before we get torn to shreds.

00:21.144 --> 00:24.311
So please don't call us heroes.

00:24.313 --> 00:25.679
We're legends.

00:26.882 --> 00:28.546
Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:28.549 --> 00:30.914
I told you, I was leaving
to create an organization

00:30.917 --> 00:32.093
to replace the Time Masters.

00:32.095 --> 00:33.963
- 15 minutes ago.
- For you.

00:33.966 --> 00:35.756
Forming the Time
Bureau has been the work

00:35.758 --> 00:37.375
of the last five years of my life.

00:39.001 --> 00:41.234
They are undependable,
unpredictable, dangerous.

00:41.237 --> 00:42.789
Yeah.

00:42.792 --> 00:46.032
My decision to leave had
nothing to do with you.

00:46.035 --> 00:48.468
I could feel myself losing control.

00:48.471 --> 00:50.460
The animal was in charge, not me.

00:50.463 --> 00:51.862
Tell me what we're facing here.

00:51.865 --> 00:53.740
That information is need-to-know.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.710
Welcome back, Kuasa.

01:00.665 --> 01:03.533
_

01:06.239 --> 01:07.872
This is A.R.G.U.S.

01:07.875 --> 01:10.381
Anti-meta-human curfew is in effect.

01:10.383 --> 01:12.850
Citizens, please stay in your homes.

01:14.888 --> 01:17.355
HQ, this is Transport X-17.

01:17.357 --> 01:18.689
En route to facility.

01:18.691 --> 01:20.224
Copy, X-17.

01:20.226 --> 01:21.950
Standing by to receive prisoner.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.445 --> 01:39.671
What the hell?

01:58.765 --> 02:00.331
Hey!

02:31.664 --> 02:33.998
Code 99.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.251
We have a code 99!

02:39.798 --> 02:44.748
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:50.850 --> 02:52.350
So there's this theory

02:52.352 --> 02:54.485
that the phrase "bring home the bacon"

02:54.487 --> 02:57.155
started in a town in Old England.

02:57.157 --> 03:00.381
Bacon was awarded to any
man who can truthfully say

03:00.384 --> 03:02.994
he and his wife had not
argued that past year.

03:02.996 --> 03:06.230
The same cannot be said of
you and Ms. Jiwe, however.

03:06.232 --> 03:08.733
No, because I'm eating bacon.

03:08.735 --> 03:10.623
- But since you asked...
- I didn't.

03:10.626 --> 03:12.837
Hey, it is a little awkward.

03:12.839 --> 03:14.639
I mean, I am a little resentful...

03:14.641 --> 03:17.508
Please, if you need to
discuss this with someone,

03:17.510 --> 03:20.100
- I would suggest Amaya.
- Yeah, I know.

03:20.103 --> 03:21.946
We should talk things out, but...

03:22.949 --> 03:24.248
Amaya.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.551
Acute arachnoid somnambulism.

03:26.553 --> 03:28.818
Now, this really is fascinating.

03:28.821 --> 03:30.087
Oh, my God.

03:30.089 --> 03:32.156
She's having a dream she's a spider.

03:32.158 --> 03:34.525
We gotta wake her up before
she crawls into the engine.

03:34.527 --> 03:35.564
Amaya!

03:35.567 --> 03:37.251
You're not supposed
to wake a sleepwalker,

03:37.254 --> 03:38.729
especially when they're
stuck to the ceiling.

03:38.731 --> 03:39.830
Why not? Amaya!

03:42.368 --> 03:44.035
That's why.

03:44.037 --> 03:45.169
Are you okay?

03:46.306 --> 03:48.472
I... I was... I was having a nightmare.

03:48.474 --> 03:51.709
And in the process, summoned
the ashe of a spider.

03:51.711 --> 03:52.743
Astonishing!

03:52.745 --> 03:54.779
No, Martin. It isn't.

03:54.781 --> 03:56.247
What if I summoned a rhino

03:56.249 --> 03:57.982
and I crashed through
the hull of the ship?

03:57.984 --> 03:59.629
Or a lion and I mauled someone?

03:59.632 --> 04:01.485
Well, if the victim was
Mr. Rory, I can imagine...

04:01.487 --> 04:03.487
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure out

04:03.489 --> 04:05.022
what's going on with you and your totem.

04:05.024 --> 04:06.090
What do you think I've been trying to do

04:06.092 --> 04:07.158
for the past six months?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.145
In my experience,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.748
there is no problem
that cannot be solved

04:09.751 --> 04:11.828
by the rigorous application of science.

04:11.831 --> 04:13.634
It's a mystical totem, Martin.

04:13.637 --> 04:16.367
I believe we should
start in the med bay.

04:16.369 --> 04:18.668
Please, please. Come
with me. Come with me.

04:24.410 --> 04:27.745
Code 99. This is Agent Gary Green.

04:27.747 --> 04:29.743
Seattle, Washington, 2042.

04:29.746 --> 04:32.817
I just witnessed a female
meta of unknown origin.

04:32.819 --> 04:34.385
She killed everyone.

04:35.556 --> 04:37.188
Hey. What's going on?

04:37.190 --> 04:39.056
We intercepted a distress call

04:39.058 --> 04:40.725
from one of Rip's Time Bureau agents.

04:40.727 --> 04:41.613
Why?

04:41.616 --> 04:43.696
Actually, forget it. I don't care.

04:43.699 --> 04:45.863
It's the dweeby one, Gary.

04:45.865 --> 04:46.801
Still don't care.

04:46.804 --> 04:48.606
Yeah, I gotta go with Mick on this one.

04:48.609 --> 04:50.234
Why would we help those ass clowns?

04:50.236 --> 04:51.669
I mean, that's not our job.

04:51.671 --> 04:53.137
Hopefully that little time dweeb

04:53.139 --> 04:54.472
learns his lesson.

04:54.474 --> 04:56.574
Agreed, but last time I checked,

04:56.576 --> 04:58.876
we help people who are in trouble.

04:59.679 --> 05:01.779
I don't.

05:10.923 --> 05:13.124
Something feels off about this place.

05:13.126 --> 05:15.593
Yeah. Like, where is everybody?

05:15.595 --> 05:17.895
Martial law. It's a police state.

05:17.897 --> 05:18.963
How do you know?

05:18.965 --> 05:20.665
I can smell pigs.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.099
He's right.

05:22.101 --> 05:24.268
All the cars on the street are military.

05:24.270 --> 05:26.370
More pigs! Get down! Get down!

05:33.746 --> 05:36.652
That's A.R.G.U.S.... covert
paramilitary organization.

05:36.655 --> 05:39.118
Yeah, but it seems they've
forgotten how to be covert.

05:39.121 --> 05:41.819
The signal we intercepted
came from over there.

05:45.686 --> 05:47.186
Should be here somewhere.

05:47.860 --> 05:50.061
Gary! Gary!

05:51.064 --> 05:52.152
Gary!

05:52.155 --> 05:54.265
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:54.267 --> 05:55.633
She's gonna kill me.

05:55.635 --> 05:57.068
The chick from your distress call?

05:57.070 --> 05:58.777
Agent Sharpe.

05:58.780 --> 06:02.048
- She hates you guys.
- Well, feeling's mutual.

06:02.051 --> 06:03.641
Look, you said there was a female meta

06:03.643 --> 06:05.343
killing everyone. What's going on?

06:05.345 --> 06:07.470
No, this is classified
Time Bureau business.

06:07.473 --> 06:09.980
Open your mouth and say some words.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.082
Guess you're gonna have to decide

06:12.085 --> 06:13.284
who you're more afraid of,

06:13.286 --> 06:15.986
Agent Sharpe or Mick here.

06:15.988 --> 06:17.788
Uh...

06:17.790 --> 06:20.634
the Bureau got a ping on
some unregulated time travel.

06:20.637 --> 06:22.760
But when I got here, the person
I was supposed to arrest...

06:22.762 --> 06:25.463
Was a meta-human who had
no problem murdering people?

06:25.465 --> 06:28.899
Her powers let her control water.

06:28.901 --> 06:31.235
A human squirt gun. Big deal.

06:31.237 --> 06:32.536
No, you guys really have no idea

06:32.538 --> 06:34.472
how dangerous this woman is.

06:35.718 --> 06:37.775
Dweeb's right. That chick's dangerous.

06:37.777 --> 06:40.770
She just blew through those
pigs like it was nothing.

06:40.773 --> 06:42.192
Actually, I fought someone

06:42.195 --> 06:44.047
with water powers like
this a few years ago.

06:44.050 --> 06:45.387
It was not very pleasant.

06:45.390 --> 06:47.385
Well, why would a
time-traveling meta-human

06:47.387 --> 06:49.687
come to 2042 to kill a
bunch of A.R.G.U.S. agents?

06:49.689 --> 06:51.822
She didn't.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.924
She came here to kill their prisoner.

06:53.926 --> 06:55.426
Well, it looks like she struck out.

06:55.428 --> 06:56.520
Something tells me

06:56.523 --> 06:58.796
our assassin doesn't give up so easily.

06:58.798 --> 07:00.965
- You got a plan, Captain?
- Why?

07:00.967 --> 07:03.367
We saved Four-eyes.
Mission accomplished.

07:03.369 --> 07:08.439
And Four-Eyes' mission was
to prevent the anachronism.

07:08.441 --> 07:10.374
You mean stop the water witch

07:10.376 --> 07:12.743
before she kills whoever was
in the back of that truck?

07:12.745 --> 07:15.079
Gideon, scan A.R.G.U.S.' logs.

07:15.081 --> 07:16.580
See if you can ID the prisoner.

07:16.582 --> 07:18.379
I can do better than that, Captain.

07:18.382 --> 07:21.051
I can project the prisoner's
most likely destination.

07:21.053 --> 07:22.887
Even better.

07:41.107 --> 07:43.240
Zari Tomaz?

07:46.512 --> 07:48.446
Come with us if you want to live.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.147
Yeah, I used that one once.

07:50.149 --> 07:52.121
Come on, let's get out of here.

07:52.124 --> 07:54.218
Yeah, I don't know who you
are or what you're doing,

07:54.220 --> 07:56.120
but you're gonna lead
A.R.G.U.S. right here.

07:56.122 --> 07:58.027
No, don't worry. We can protect you.

07:58.030 --> 07:59.757
Who's gonna protect you?

08:02.595 --> 08:04.695
This is A.R.G.U.S.

08:04.697 --> 08:06.892
Sara Lance, Nathaniel Heywood,

08:06.895 --> 08:09.533
Raymond Palmer, and Mick
Rory, you are listed

08:09.535 --> 08:11.595
in the Meta-human Registry as missing.

08:11.598 --> 08:13.070
You are hereby under arrest

08:13.072 --> 08:15.139
for violating the Anti-Meta-human Act.

08:15.141 --> 08:16.215
Anti-Meta-human?

08:16.218 --> 08:18.074
Yeah, meta-humans have
been illegal since 2021.

08:18.077 --> 08:19.376
Didn't you guys get the memo?

08:19.378 --> 08:21.712
No.

08:21.714 --> 08:23.824
Well, nice to meet you. I'm out.

08:23.827 --> 08:25.415
Wait, your life is still in danger!

08:26.752 --> 08:28.649
- Remain where you are.
- Ditto. Bye.

08:28.652 --> 08:30.654
Detainment units have been notified.

08:30.656 --> 08:32.823
Hate to destroy futuristic
technology, but...

08:34.994 --> 08:37.561
- Stand down!
- Go! Go!

08:37.563 --> 08:40.498
You are surrounded.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.666
Under the Meta-human Act of 2021,

08:42.668 --> 08:44.168
you are under arrest.

08:44.169 --> 08:47.471
On the ground! Hands behind your head!

08:47.473 --> 08:49.440
Final warning!

08:50.610 --> 08:51.809
Do as they say.

08:51.811 --> 08:53.244
You gotta be kidding me.

08:53.246 --> 08:54.712
That's an order.

09:06.611 --> 09:08.644
Don't suppose I get to call my lawyer.

09:35.740 --> 09:38.507
- What?
- I wanted to shoot someone.

09:38.509 --> 09:40.242
All right, let's get
back to the Waverider,

09:40.244 --> 09:42.044
see if we can get a line on Tomaz.

09:42.046 --> 09:45.014
Why? Pretty sure she
just told us to screw off.

09:45.016 --> 09:47.182
Doesn't change the fact that
there's a rogue time traveler

09:47.184 --> 09:48.217
trying to kill her.

09:48.219 --> 09:49.318
I can see why.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.920
Let's go.

09:54.825 --> 09:56.692
There's nothing to worry about.

09:56.694 --> 09:59.228
Gideon can't find anything
medically wrong with you.

09:59.230 --> 10:01.964
I told you, Martin,
my problem is mystical.

10:01.966 --> 10:03.465
It's not scientific.

10:03.467 --> 10:05.134
Believe me, mysticism is merely science

10:05.136 --> 10:06.902
that hasn't been understood yet.

10:06.904 --> 10:08.837
Hey! Did you figure out
what's wrong with her?

10:08.839 --> 10:10.539
I'm sitting right here, Nathaniel.

10:10.541 --> 10:12.808
I suggest we consider
a new battery of tests...

10:12.810 --> 10:13.892
I don't think there's...

10:13.895 --> 10:15.477
To check on an overactive hippocampus,

10:15.479 --> 10:16.912
latent chromosomal imbalance,

10:16.914 --> 10:19.017
not to mention temporal dysplasia.

10:19.020 --> 10:21.984
I'll ask Jax to adjust
Gideon's diagnostic algorithm.

10:21.986 --> 10:24.420
There's no algorithm
for what's wrong with me.

10:25.690 --> 10:28.123
It's my totem.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.459
It's the legacy of my ancestors.

10:30.461 --> 10:34.063
Great, so let's go
talk to your ancestors.

10:34.065 --> 10:35.597
We're on a time ship.

10:37.068 --> 10:39.301
This totem means I protect my village,

10:39.303 --> 10:41.036
not mess with its history.

10:42.406 --> 10:44.106
What is her problem?

10:44.108 --> 10:47.970
Side effect of temporal
dysplasia, I suspect.

10:52.616 --> 10:54.720
Hey, how you feeling?

10:54.723 --> 10:56.189
Like I just understood

10:56.192 --> 10:58.787
what you meant by the
term "mansplaining."

10:59.724 --> 11:02.124
I take it from Nathaniel's
premature return,

11:02.126 --> 11:04.693
you didn't have much
luck with Ms. Tomaz.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.495
Well, that was interesting.

11:06.497 --> 11:09.631
Turns out Zari's a bit of
a... not very nice person.

11:09.633 --> 11:13.168
Apparently it's illegal
to be a meta-human in 2042.

11:13.170 --> 11:14.903
You know what I don't get? A.R.G.U.S.

11:14.905 --> 11:16.972
- In 2016, they weren't...
- Idiots.

11:16.974 --> 11:18.741
Well, I was gonna say
they weren't trying

11:18.743 --> 11:20.657
to control the city with
killer drones, but...

11:20.660 --> 11:24.646
Any authoritarian organization
always goes bad... always.

11:24.648 --> 11:26.290
Which means it's only a matter of time

11:26.293 --> 11:29.984
before Rip and his Time Bureau
turn into the Time Gestapo.

11:29.987 --> 11:32.521
In case you've forgotten,
the Time Bureau only exists

11:32.523 --> 11:34.490
to clean up your time mess.

11:34.492 --> 11:36.639
Which now includes an
at-large time assassin

11:36.642 --> 11:38.093
and a fugitive hacker!

11:38.095 --> 11:41.663
Is that your way of
thanking us for rescuing you?

11:41.665 --> 11:44.666
Gideon, do we have a
location on Zari yet?

11:44.668 --> 11:46.040
Negative, Captain.

11:46.043 --> 11:48.137
I'm afraid Ms. Tomaz has
stepped up her efforts

11:48.139 --> 11:49.838
to remain undetected.

11:49.840 --> 11:52.374
Damn, I can see why.
Look at this rap sheet.

11:52.376 --> 11:56.445
Burglary, larceny, grand
larceny, identity theft,

11:56.447 --> 11:58.847
trespassing, digital trespassing,

11:58.849 --> 12:01.216
meta-human smuggling, conspiracy...

12:01.218 --> 12:02.584
Impressive.

12:02.586 --> 12:04.920
Multiple religious infractions.

12:04.922 --> 12:07.156
- What do you mean?
- Zari's Muslim.

12:07.158 --> 12:10.426
And apparently religion
is illegal in 2042.

12:10.428 --> 12:12.061
Rory, if you had this much heat on you,

12:12.063 --> 12:13.162
where would you go?

12:19.303 --> 12:21.937
My bar.

12:21.940 --> 12:23.952
What have they done to my bar?

12:28.245 --> 12:30.479
Too much, Ray, too much.

12:30.481 --> 12:32.714
What? I look like I just robbed a bank.

12:32.716 --> 12:34.216
Or a costume store.

12:38.022 --> 12:39.955
There she is.

12:48.566 --> 12:51.700
You run, scream, or sic
one of those drones on us,

12:51.702 --> 12:54.269
I'll light you up. You got that, missy?

12:54.271 --> 12:56.205
Are you guys stalking me?

12:56.207 --> 12:59.074
Not me, but for some reason,
my boss has a bee in her bonnet

12:59.076 --> 13:01.946
about protecting you from that, uh,

13:01.949 --> 13:03.214
water bitch.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.517
Not you, sweetheart.

13:06.417 --> 13:09.184
Yeah, I can take care of myself.

13:09.186 --> 13:10.419
Is that right?

13:10.421 --> 13:12.212
That why you're in this bar?

13:12.215 --> 13:13.981
Looking to hire muscle?

13:15.493 --> 13:18.759
Look, you can trust us,
okay? We're the good guys.

13:18.762 --> 13:22.331
Oh, don't be fooled by our disguises.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.432
Good guy!

13:24.869 --> 13:26.168
It's her.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.275
Let's get out of here. Come on.

13:45.456 --> 13:47.829
Oh, a pool party.

13:49.463 --> 13:50.962
Cute tricks.

14:00.304 --> 14:01.623
Get her to the ship!

14:01.626 --> 14:03.238
You guys have a ship?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.840
Is it a big ship?

14:23.702 --> 14:25.502
How about a diversion, Rory?

14:27.164 --> 14:30.666
Who wants to fight?

14:34.038 --> 14:35.504
Go!

14:41.747 --> 14:44.963
Okay, this is...

14:44.965 --> 14:46.465
almost amazing.

14:46.467 --> 14:47.933
What do you mean, "almost"?

14:47.935 --> 14:50.043
Don't worry. You'll be safe here.

14:50.046 --> 14:51.762
Who's the woman that's after you?

14:51.765 --> 14:53.458
No idea.

14:53.461 --> 14:55.906
Any idea of why someone
would want to kill you?

14:55.909 --> 14:57.676
Yeah, I can think of
quite a few, actually.

14:57.678 --> 14:59.043
Look, if we're gonna help you,

14:59.046 --> 15:02.036
you need to start being
more straightforward.

15:02.039 --> 15:03.605
What is she doing here?

15:03.608 --> 15:05.449
Uh, water woman was trying to kill her,

15:05.452 --> 15:07.762
so we're, um, protecting her.

15:07.765 --> 15:11.255
No, this is technology
you are not allowed to see.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.825
Civilians are not allowed
to know about time travel.

15:16.590 --> 15:18.597
Wait, you guys are time travelers?

15:18.599 --> 15:20.298
Nice one, Gary.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.114
Okay, that's on me.

15:22.117 --> 15:25.570
Uh, b-but still, our job is
to prevent the anachronism,

15:25.572 --> 15:28.540
which means capturing the
assassin, not the target.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.842
I can't believe...

15:30.844 --> 15:33.612
You guys are
time-traveling superheroes?

15:33.614 --> 15:36.448
Yeah, we've actually
saved the world twice.

15:36.450 --> 15:37.817
Not that we're counting.

15:37.820 --> 15:39.718
Really? You saved the world.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.254
- Twice!
- Then why does it still suck?

15:42.256 --> 15:44.389
Uh, just for the record,

15:44.391 --> 15:46.458
dealing with that messed-up
police state of yours,

15:46.460 --> 15:48.309
that's on our to-do list, so...

15:48.312 --> 15:50.662
But after we capture the
person trying to kill you.

15:50.664 --> 15:53.059
And we need your help to do it.

15:54.096 --> 15:56.330
Oh, I get it.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.904
Since you have no way of
tracking this water psycho,

15:58.906 --> 16:01.740
you plan to use me as bait, right?

16:01.742 --> 16:03.608
Right.

16:03.610 --> 16:06.211
Okay, I'll help you, on one condition.

16:06.213 --> 16:09.047
You help me break my brother
out of the A.R.G.U.S. facility

16:09.049 --> 16:11.416
where they're holding him.

16:11.418 --> 16:14.553
Prison break.

16:14.555 --> 16:16.188
I'm in. No, no.

16:16.190 --> 16:17.656
No, no, no, no, no,
they're not helping you,

16:17.658 --> 16:19.192
because they're still helping me.

16:19.195 --> 16:22.327
Guys, this mission has gone
way off the rails as it is.

16:22.329 --> 16:24.462
Zari's brother is not the priority.

16:24.464 --> 16:27.275
If you really want my
help, then that's my price.

16:30.088 --> 16:32.704
Guess we're breaking
into an A.R.G.U.S. prison.

16:37.244 --> 16:40.111
Okay, so I've been doing some research.

16:40.113 --> 16:43.915
Turns out there's a root
from your region of Zambesi

16:43.918 --> 16:46.300
that's known for its
spiritual healing properties.

16:46.303 --> 16:48.111
- The Lyoga root?
- That's the one.

16:48.114 --> 16:49.847
It's a powerful hallucinogen.

16:49.850 --> 16:51.956
Yes, and people use
it to go vision quests.

16:51.959 --> 16:54.059
Oh, so you admit that my problem

16:54.061 --> 16:55.560
might be mystical in nature?

16:55.562 --> 16:56.828
Well, if you say it's mystical,

16:56.830 --> 16:58.663
then it's mystical.

16:58.665 --> 17:00.465
Anyways, I was having
a chat with Gideon,

17:00.467 --> 17:03.201
and it turns out our
favorite talking supercomputer

17:03.203 --> 17:07.439
is really great at synthesizing
pretty much anything.

17:07.441 --> 17:10.557
No. Please tell me you didn't.

17:10.560 --> 17:12.877
We re-created the Lyoga root extract

17:12.880 --> 17:15.057
right here on the ship.

17:15.060 --> 17:16.580
I mean, Gideon did most of the work.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.116
I pushed, like, seven buttons.

17:18.117 --> 17:20.318
Nate, this is a really bad idea.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.287
A single miscalculation could be lethal.

17:22.289 --> 17:26.191
Which is why I did a quality
control test on myself first.

17:26.193 --> 17:28.108
What? You already took it?

17:28.111 --> 17:31.229
Yeah. I just had to
make sure it was safe.

17:32.332 --> 17:33.760
So far, pretty good.

17:33.763 --> 17:36.601
Um, the tongue, getting a little numb.

17:36.603 --> 17:38.837
But, um, you should drink it now

17:38.839 --> 17:41.039
so we peak at the same time, please.

17:43.810 --> 17:45.377
Okay.

17:48.982 --> 17:51.516
Whoa. Ah!

17:51.519 --> 17:54.088
Right, we should be
sitting down for this.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.224
The room should be dark.

17:59.226 --> 18:00.959
Gideon?

18:05.299 --> 18:06.398
Okay.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.033
So what do we do now?

18:08.035 --> 18:11.846
Believe it or not, this
is my first vision quest.

18:11.849 --> 18:13.149
Do we chant?

18:13.152 --> 18:14.472
- No.
- No.

18:14.474 --> 18:16.541
We stop talking.

18:16.543 --> 18:21.246
Close your eyes and just... breathe.

18:21.248 --> 18:24.382
Breathing in. Breathing out.

18:24.384 --> 18:25.350
Breathing in again...

18:25.352 --> 18:26.484
Nate.

18:27.921 --> 18:29.154
Sorry.

18:41.768 --> 18:44.636
_

18:52.612 --> 18:54.312
Rory, don't.

18:54.314 --> 18:55.447
Just a little.

18:55.449 --> 18:57.893
Maybe later. Which way?

18:57.896 --> 18:59.395
My brother's in the east wing annex.

18:59.398 --> 19:00.731
The blueprints Gideon downloaded

19:00.734 --> 19:02.219
said the control panel's this way.

19:02.222 --> 19:04.122
You guys open the cell.

19:04.124 --> 19:05.523
Let's go talk to your brother.

19:09.096 --> 19:11.796
Now.

19:11.798 --> 19:14.499
Hey! How's it going?

19:14.501 --> 19:16.935
There's no maintenance
scheduled here till tomorrow.

19:16.937 --> 19:20.772
Really? We got a call that,
uh, something was broken.

19:20.774 --> 19:22.207
Yeah? What?

19:22.209 --> 19:23.942
Your nose.

19:30.350 --> 19:34.471
Says here my brother's
being held in cell 4587.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.799
You guys got a location on
the other security console?

19:36.802 --> 19:40.257
Yep, all clear.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.061
All right, which cell
do we need to open?

19:43.063 --> 19:45.697
It's room 4587.

19:45.699 --> 19:47.088
Okay, I'm on it.

19:50.937 --> 19:52.037
Wait a minute.

19:54.440 --> 19:57.942
You mean everybody locked
up in here is a meta?

19:57.944 --> 19:59.677
Yeah. Looks like A.R.G.U.S.

19:59.679 --> 20:01.679
is conducting experiments on them.

20:01.681 --> 20:04.616
Guys, open the cell now.

20:04.618 --> 20:06.785
I can do a lot better than that.

20:09.489 --> 20:11.122
What are you doing?

20:12.025 --> 20:14.225
What does it look like?

20:26.640 --> 20:28.807
Hurry! This way. Come on.

20:28.809 --> 20:30.642
Come on. Let's go!

20:30.644 --> 20:32.977
I thought you were just
gonna open her brother's cell.

20:32.979 --> 20:35.480
You didn't see what
we saw on the monitors.

20:35.482 --> 20:39.017
A.R.G.U.S. is experimenting
on these prisoners.

20:39.019 --> 20:41.019
Hey, where's Zari?

20:56.636 --> 20:57.971
What the hell is going on?

20:57.974 --> 21:00.371
I thought this was just
about grabbing your brother.

21:00.373 --> 21:02.974
Yeah, about that... sorry.

21:02.976 --> 21:05.110
- Sorry for what?
- There is no brother.

21:05.112 --> 21:08.680
There is no prison break. It's a heist.

21:08.682 --> 21:09.981
You used us.

21:09.983 --> 21:12.517
We bent over backwards to help you.

21:12.519 --> 21:14.619
As lies go, this was a pretty white one.

21:14.621 --> 21:17.889
This used to be my
brother's. Now it's mine.

21:27.267 --> 21:28.600
Wha...

21:30.904 --> 21:32.370
Oh, my God.

21:32.372 --> 21:34.706
- Nate?
- Not supposed to talk.

21:34.708 --> 21:36.241
Nate, look.

21:36.243 --> 21:38.009
Not supposed to open your eyes either.

21:39.146 --> 21:43.248
Oh! I think I'm starting to peak.

21:58.732 --> 22:01.268
Amaya, you okay?

22:02.702 --> 22:08.640
Nananom ba ho ban me.

22:08.642 --> 22:10.975
Oh, boy.

22:10.977 --> 22:12.697
Where's Zari?

22:12.700 --> 22:15.747
- Go! Go!
- Oh, man!

22:15.749 --> 22:17.382
Knock yourself out.

22:17.384 --> 22:20.218
'Bout time.

22:20.220 --> 22:21.522
Uh, Nate, buddy?

22:21.525 --> 22:24.069
We need you to bring the
Waverider to us... now.

22:24.072 --> 22:26.539
Um...

22:26.542 --> 22:28.726
Stay.

22:28.728 --> 22:30.728
Uh...

22:30.730 --> 22:33.198
Okay, um...

22:33.200 --> 22:36.561
Yeah, I can, um... I can do that.

22:43.510 --> 22:45.977
My face! My face!

22:49.015 --> 22:52.150
This room is huge!

22:55.855 --> 22:58.022
Pulling up the anchor!

22:58.024 --> 23:00.158
Raising the sails!

23:00.160 --> 23:01.626
Full speed ahead!

23:04.631 --> 23:06.798
That's enough, Zari!

23:06.800 --> 23:09.033
You're not going anywhere without us.

23:09.035 --> 23:10.448
Is that right?

23:16.687 --> 23:18.187
That's a cool getaway.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.091
Don't worry. I'll follow her.

23:21.094 --> 23:22.209
Where's Pretty?

23:22.212 --> 23:24.248
Nate, how are we doing with that rescue?

23:24.251 --> 23:26.651
I'm givin' her all she's got, Cap'n!

23:26.653 --> 23:28.786
The ship can't take much more of this!

23:28.788 --> 23:32.924
Actually, Dr. Heywood, the
engines are still idling.

23:36.429 --> 23:39.264
Then why does it feel like
my face is peeling off?

23:39.266 --> 23:40.798
Yo, are you high or something, man?

23:40.800 --> 23:42.867
You have no idea.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.369
Gideon, take command of the ship.

23:44.371 --> 23:46.037
I'll arrange a rendezvous point.

23:46.039 --> 23:47.912
Let's get out of here.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.196
Where's Stein anyway?

23:54.199 --> 23:55.884
I believe he's checking on Ms. Jiwe.

23:55.887 --> 23:59.837
She seems to be experiencing
a, well, unusual side effect.

23:59.840 --> 24:01.602
And as for Mr. Heywood, he's in...

24:01.605 --> 24:04.776
We got bigger fish to fry.
Ray, you have eyes on Zari?

24:04.779 --> 24:07.146
Yep, I'm on her tail... Not literally.

24:07.148 --> 24:09.882
I'm following her posterior
from a respectable distance.

24:09.884 --> 24:11.784
I can't believe she played us like that.

24:11.786 --> 24:13.291
The whole sob story about her brother,

24:13.293 --> 24:15.921
just an excuse to get her
hands on some magical necklace.

24:15.923 --> 24:18.430
When we find that chick,
I am gonna kill her.

24:18.433 --> 24:19.618
I like her.

24:19.621 --> 24:23.031
Uh, when you say kill her,
what you really mean is...

24:23.034 --> 24:25.509
Kill her. And slowly.

24:25.512 --> 24:28.157
No, no, no, no, no, no, we
have to restore the timeline,

24:28.160 --> 24:29.563
which means getting Ms. Tomaz

24:29.566 --> 24:31.587
back to the A.R.G.U.S.
black site where she belongs

24:31.590 --> 24:33.390
and tracking down your time assassin.

24:33.393 --> 24:36.098
Oh, and cleaning up the prison debacle!

24:36.100 --> 24:38.040
Don't worry, Gary. We got this.

24:39.704 --> 24:41.771
Jeez Louise, this disaster
keeps getting bigger

24:41.773 --> 24:43.384
and bigger and bigger.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.110
What are you doing?

24:51.549 --> 24:54.790
Well, I hate to say
it, but Gary's right.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.719
We gotta put Zari back in the bottle.

24:56.721 --> 24:58.187
Look, she's not exactly

24:58.189 --> 24:59.989
my favorite person either right now.

24:59.991 --> 25:04.193
But you didn't see
how it was back there.

25:04.195 --> 25:06.662
The way A.R.G.U.S. was
treating those people?

25:06.664 --> 25:08.898
She played us, Jax.

25:08.900 --> 25:11.801
We're lucky that it's not
us in that prison instead.

25:11.803 --> 25:15.071
She had a water witch travel
through time to hunt her down.

25:15.073 --> 25:17.807
I mean, did Zari really
act any differently

25:17.809 --> 25:20.610
than you would've in that situation?

25:20.612 --> 25:24.213
I'm just saying, do we
really want to be the people

25:24.215 --> 25:26.582
who put her back in a meta prison?

25:26.584 --> 25:28.384
Is that who we are?

25:32.390 --> 25:33.823
I can see through my hand.

25:37.495 --> 25:39.428
Are you on drugs?

25:42.266 --> 25:45.368
Your face.

25:45.370 --> 25:48.618
Okay, buddy. Not a good idea.

25:48.621 --> 25:49.880
Gideon!

25:49.883 --> 25:51.313
As I was trying to tell you,

25:51.316 --> 25:52.748
Mr. Heywood is under the influence

25:52.751 --> 25:55.085
of a hallucinogenic compound.

25:55.088 --> 25:58.514
To help Amaya with her totem problem.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.049
Okay? It's totally safe.

26:00.051 --> 26:01.851
People in her village
do it all the ti...

26:05.957 --> 26:07.657
It's safe, I think.

26:07.659 --> 26:09.063
As for Ms. Jiwe,

26:09.066 --> 26:11.394
Professor Stein helped
her to the medical bay.

26:11.396 --> 26:13.329
Get him to his quarters now!

26:13.331 --> 26:16.599
Give him some water and
maybe his fidget spinner.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.038
Told you, bro. Let's go. Come on now.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.239
Cobra!

26:23.241 --> 26:25.141
All right, all right. Just...

26:27.311 --> 26:30.112
Amaya.

27:01.946 --> 27:04.313
Amaya.

27:09.587 --> 27:11.420
What is this place?

27:11.422 --> 27:15.324
You are in the world between worlds.

27:15.326 --> 27:16.892
Who are you?

27:16.894 --> 27:18.461
I am your blood.

27:18.463 --> 27:20.649
I am all who have come before you.

27:25.436 --> 27:29.004
I can feel the fear inside you.

27:29.013 --> 27:32.381
It is a burden that
weighs heavy on your heart.

27:33.644 --> 27:37.813
My totem, I can feel
it growing stronger.

27:37.815 --> 27:40.483
I fear that I'm losing control over it.

27:41.586 --> 27:44.687
You can't stop the forces of nature,

27:44.689 --> 27:48.357
no more than you can
stop a charging stallion.

27:48.359 --> 27:51.961
You must learn to run beside it.

27:51.963 --> 27:54.263
But why is it getting stronger?

27:54.265 --> 27:56.665
The totem's strength grows

27:56.667 --> 28:00.436
when the threats that you
must face become more powerful.

28:00.438 --> 28:05.167
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

28:05.170 --> 28:07.728
You must find the girl.

28:07.731 --> 28:11.680
She needs your protection.

28:11.682 --> 28:15.284
Do not fail this new totem-bearer.

28:16.888 --> 28:19.989
Do not resist your power.

28:21.759 --> 28:24.193
Trust in it.

28:34.906 --> 28:36.472
Zari.

28:36.474 --> 28:39.073
Look, I don't want to
fight, but we gotta go.

28:39.076 --> 28:40.643
We can't stay here. It's not safe.

28:40.645 --> 28:42.511
I don't understand.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.981
They're not here.

28:45.983 --> 28:47.650
Nobody's here.

28:49.821 --> 28:51.453
They were supposed to meet me here.

28:51.455 --> 28:53.789
This was supposed to be our Jannah.

28:53.791 --> 28:55.191
Jannah?

28:56.928 --> 28:59.236
It means "sanctuary" in Arabic.

29:07.672 --> 29:10.840
My brother had powers
because he wielded this.

29:10.842 --> 29:14.677
He fought against A.R.G.U.S.'
injustices, so he was hunted.

29:14.679 --> 29:16.512
We all were.

29:16.514 --> 29:20.249
The night we were leaving,
A.R.G.U.S. raided our house.

29:20.251 --> 29:23.786
Killed my brother

29:23.788 --> 29:27.022
and took the only part
that's left of him.

29:27.024 --> 29:28.757
And that's how you got caught...

29:28.759 --> 29:30.392
Trying to steal it the first time?

29:30.394 --> 29:32.862
Yeah, I couldn't let A.R.G.U.S. keep it.

29:32.864 --> 29:35.264
With my brother gone, I needed its power

29:35.266 --> 29:38.100
to help me protect my parents, but...

29:38.102 --> 29:40.087
- Maybe they got away.
- Where?

29:40.090 --> 29:42.538
Can't you see there's
nowhere left to go?

29:42.540 --> 29:44.940
This was our last hope.

29:44.942 --> 29:47.243
Zari, I'm sorry about everything

29:47.245 --> 29:49.645
that's happened to your
family, but we really have to...

29:53.017 --> 29:54.917
Sara, the water woman just showed up,

29:54.919 --> 29:56.540
and she looks pretty grumpy.

29:56.543 --> 29:59.021
Like "kill anyone that
gets in her way" grumpy.

29:59.023 --> 30:00.856
Send us your coordinates.
We're on our way.

30:00.858 --> 30:03.931
What's going on now?

30:03.934 --> 30:06.495
Unidentified ship approaching, Captain.

30:06.497 --> 30:08.731
- A.R.G.U.S.?
- No, Captain.

30:08.733 --> 30:10.799
It's the Time Bureau.

30:19.505 --> 30:21.072
I don't understand.

30:21.075 --> 30:23.231
How does the Time Bureau
know where we were?

30:26.043 --> 30:27.676
Gary!

30:27.678 --> 30:30.045
I'm sorry. I know you
said you could handle it,

30:30.047 --> 30:32.848
but you guys can't handle anything!

30:32.850 --> 30:34.716
I should go.

30:39.023 --> 30:40.689
Sara Lance.

30:40.691 --> 30:42.591
I see that you and
your team have managed

30:42.593 --> 30:45.027
to get yourselves in
over your heads again.

30:45.029 --> 30:47.296
- Chill, lady.
- We were just trying to help.

30:47.298 --> 30:49.545
By starting a prison riot
at the A.R.G.U.S. facility?

30:49.548 --> 30:52.034
When are you going
to learn that the Legends

30:52.036 --> 30:54.169
should not be interfering
with Bureau affairs?

30:54.171 --> 30:56.413
Maybe when you stop screwing things up.

30:56.416 --> 30:59.308
Uh, perhaps it's best
not to antagonize someone

30:59.310 --> 31:02.077
on such a large time ship.

31:02.079 --> 31:06.048
I don't care what Gary
says. We don't need backup.

31:06.050 --> 31:08.408
Sara! I need backup!

31:08.411 --> 31:10.010
Sara!

31:11.155 --> 31:12.387
Where are you guys?

31:13.501 --> 31:15.657
Interesting... sounds like
one of your team members

31:15.659 --> 31:17.720
has stumbled sideways
into finding our assassin.

31:17.723 --> 31:19.427
Yes, that's rather our style.

31:19.430 --> 31:21.280
Just give us his coordinates.

31:21.283 --> 31:23.398
We would be happy to save him for you.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.500
You know these guys are
just gonna hand Zari back

31:25.502 --> 31:26.969
to those A.R.G.U.S. bastards,

31:26.971 --> 31:28.492
who are gonna do God knows what to her.

31:28.494 --> 31:29.736
And if you don't comply,

31:29.739 --> 31:32.407
we would also be happy to
scatter you all into space.

31:35.312 --> 31:37.212
Did you just shoot at us?

31:37.214 --> 31:40.182
I am not screwing around.
Give us those coordinates.

31:40.184 --> 31:41.984
The next one will not
be a warning, Ms. Lance.

31:41.986 --> 31:44.453
I knew we shouldn't have
trusted that time dweeb.

31:44.455 --> 31:46.556
Just give her what she wants.

31:47.925 --> 31:50.359
Fine.

31:50.361 --> 31:53.862
I'll uplink their coordinates to you now.

31:53.864 --> 31:56.631
You gotta be kidding me.

31:58.102 --> 31:59.623
Ready?

31:59.626 --> 32:02.471
Ready to receive.

32:06.643 --> 32:09.277
Whoa, they're gone.

32:09.279 --> 32:10.392
I can see that, Gary.

32:10.395 --> 32:11.947
Track their signature and follow them.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.887
That was easier than I thought it'd be.

32:30.901 --> 32:33.402
Is this what you're looking for?

32:41.412 --> 32:43.245
So you do have it.

32:43.247 --> 32:45.347
But are you capable of using it?

32:45.349 --> 32:47.449
What are you offering for the totem?

32:47.451 --> 32:50.619
I can give you what
you really want, Zari.

32:50.621 --> 32:53.822
What you want more than
that little trinket.

32:53.824 --> 32:55.924
I can give you revenge.

32:55.926 --> 32:58.360
Revenge on A.R.G.U.S.

32:58.362 --> 33:00.295
They targeted you and your family.

33:00.297 --> 33:02.998
Turned you all into
fugitives and criminals.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.666
They should die.

33:05.903 --> 33:08.837
In exchange for your
help, I give you this?

33:08.839 --> 33:11.273
You can't control this power.

33:11.275 --> 33:12.974
It wasn't meant for you.

33:12.976 --> 33:15.710
I can free you from this burden

33:15.712 --> 33:19.448
and help you get
justice for your family.

33:25.089 --> 33:27.022
Maybe picking a fight
with the Time Bureau

33:27.024 --> 33:28.423
wasn't the best strategy.

33:28.425 --> 33:30.631
Yep, well, they fired on us first.

33:30.634 --> 33:32.134
And if they continue to do so,

33:32.137 --> 33:35.130
we will sustain critical damage
in less than five minutes.

33:36.867 --> 33:38.567
Four minutes.

33:39.336 --> 33:40.769
Well?

33:40.771 --> 33:43.605
I-I guess I have to say...

33:45.642 --> 33:47.342
Sorry.

33:52.282 --> 33:54.049
Come on, Ray. She's too much for us.

33:54.051 --> 33:54.960
We gotta move.

33:54.963 --> 33:56.384
And she tastes terrible!

34:00.591 --> 34:01.733
What's happening?

34:01.736 --> 34:03.692
Time pukes are shooting at us.

34:03.694 --> 34:05.660
At least you seem to be
feeling better, Ms. Jiwe.

34:05.662 --> 34:08.929
Yeah, Nathaniel's
plan, while ill-advised,

34:08.931 --> 34:10.331
was beneficial.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.199
Quiet! The marshmallows are talking.

34:12.202 --> 34:15.070
Get to the jump ship! Get
a fix on Ray's position

34:15.072 --> 34:17.539
while Stein and I keep our
Time Bureau friends busy.

34:17.541 --> 34:20.675
Not you, space ranger. Sit!

34:24.348 --> 34:26.648
Whoa.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.327
I really love this show.

34:30.507 --> 34:31.974
Gideon, status.

34:31.976 --> 34:33.577
The jump ship has been deployed.

34:33.580 --> 34:36.114
I don't believe our pursuers noticed.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.627
Oh, dear! I'm afraid our rear deflectors

34:38.629 --> 34:40.362
have been completely lost, Captain.

34:40.364 --> 34:42.130
Sara, please. We still have enough time

34:42.132 --> 34:44.322
to arrange a détente
with the Time Bureau.

34:44.324 --> 34:46.033
A compromise, if you will.

34:46.036 --> 34:48.003
Sorry, Martin. I don't compromise.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.967
Would you please help me
talk some sense into her?

34:49.971 --> 34:51.606
I like broccoli!

34:51.608 --> 34:54.275
Gideon, divert everything
to our forward shields.

34:54.277 --> 34:56.844
You guys might want to hold on.

35:03.086 --> 35:04.853
Gideon, hail the Time Bureau.

35:04.855 --> 35:06.354
What are you doing?

35:06.356 --> 35:07.856
Being true to who we are.

35:07.858 --> 35:10.192
My team doesn't roll over on their own.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.661
Zari Tomaz is not one of your own.

35:12.663 --> 35:15.030
Either way, we're not gonna let you,

35:15.032 --> 35:16.631
A.R.G.U.S., or anyone else

35:16.633 --> 35:18.700
put her behind bars for who she is.

35:18.702 --> 35:21.369
So you'd rather kill your team and mine?

35:27.644 --> 35:30.143
Collision in ten seconds, Captain.

35:30.146 --> 35:31.746
Last chance, Ms. Lance!

35:31.748 --> 35:33.481
Sara, this is madness!

35:36.186 --> 35:37.652
Change your course!

35:37.654 --> 35:39.588
I'm good.

35:46.496 --> 35:50.265
Impact in three, two, one.

35:56.073 --> 35:58.540
Are we dead? Did... did we die?

35:58.542 --> 36:00.542
The Time Bureau vessel jumped away.

36:00.544 --> 36:02.777
Gideon, make sure
they're not following us.

36:02.779 --> 36:05.072
Professor, you all right?

36:05.075 --> 36:07.849
Nothing that a cup of tea won't fix.

36:07.851 --> 36:10.752
One cup of Lyoga root tea
for the professor coming up,

36:10.754 --> 36:12.153
'cause you're my best friend!

36:18.774 --> 36:20.150
What made you change your mind?

36:20.153 --> 36:22.078
Thought about what my
brother would want me to do.

36:24.013 --> 36:26.117
Weren't your friends supposed
to be coming to rescue us?

36:26.119 --> 36:27.235
Good point.

36:27.237 --> 36:28.770
You had your chance.

36:28.772 --> 36:31.106
I was willing to offer you a compromise.

36:31.108 --> 36:32.674
But now I have to kill you.

36:32.676 --> 36:34.909
I'm afraid we can't let you do that!

36:37.447 --> 36:39.781
If anyone's gonna kill
Haircut, it's me, lady.

36:39.783 --> 36:42.250
- Aw, thanks, Mick.
- Pleasure.

36:42.252 --> 36:43.685
You think you could stop me?

36:48.225 --> 36:50.369
Trust in it.

36:53.964 --> 36:55.263
Whoa, what are you doing?

36:55.265 --> 36:56.831
Trusting it.

37:05.609 --> 37:07.542
How?

37:15.419 --> 37:19.087
Stay down. I can do this all day.

37:19.089 --> 37:20.488
I would kill you.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.894
But I'd just be killing myself.

37:39.747 --> 37:41.981
All right, Gideon. How are we doing?

37:41.983 --> 37:45.001
Our time jump from Jannah
remained undetected, Captain.

37:45.004 --> 37:47.987
I think we can safely say
our Time Bureau problem is...

37:47.989 --> 37:49.457
Oh, bollocks.

37:49.460 --> 37:51.390
- Perhaps I spoke too soon.
- What is it?

37:51.392 --> 37:53.759
Incoming transmission from Agent Sharpe.

37:53.761 --> 37:56.223
Put her on.

37:58.232 --> 38:01.867
Oh, hey, Ava.

38:01.869 --> 38:03.301
How was your day?

38:03.304 --> 38:05.037
You do realize that that
little stunt of yours

38:05.039 --> 38:06.305
could've destroyed us both.

38:06.307 --> 38:08.040
You tried to kill us first.

38:08.042 --> 38:09.675
No, I tried to warn you first.

38:09.677 --> 38:11.310
But you don't take warnings, do you?

38:11.312 --> 38:12.848
Now you're starting to get it.

38:12.851 --> 38:14.714
Well, this isn't a warning. It's a promise.

38:14.716 --> 38:16.782
If I ever track you down again,

38:16.784 --> 38:18.584
you and your band of
idiots will be exiled

38:18.586 --> 38:20.067
to the dawn of time.

38:20.070 --> 38:23.122
Whatever leniency
Hunter gave you is over.

38:23.124 --> 38:24.623
What a bitch.

38:27.595 --> 38:30.997
You took the words right
out of my mouth, Gideon.

38:30.999 --> 38:33.278
Plot a course to 2042.

38:35.536 --> 38:38.204
Hey, how do you feel?

38:38.206 --> 38:40.639
Yeah, much better. And you?

38:40.641 --> 38:44.443
Ugh, I thought the hangover I
got drinking with P.T. Barnum

38:44.445 --> 38:47.346
was bad, oof.

38:47.348 --> 38:50.616
Hey, I wanted to thank you.

38:50.618 --> 38:52.942
I've gotten a handle on my totem again.

38:54.622 --> 38:56.789
That's great.

38:56.791 --> 39:00.426
You can at least try not
to sound so disappointed.

39:00.428 --> 39:03.963
It's cool. I just thought
you were staying on the ship

39:03.965 --> 39:05.817
because your totem was out of whack,

39:05.820 --> 39:09.920
and now that it's back in whack...

39:09.923 --> 39:12.438
I can't go.

39:12.440 --> 39:15.241
This whole experience
has made me realize

39:15.243 --> 39:17.910
that my fate is entwined
with someone else's.

39:20.381 --> 39:21.781
Zari's.

39:25.019 --> 39:26.619
Well, um...

39:26.621 --> 39:30.322
Sara said we're dropping
her back off in 2042.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.633
_

39:41.636 --> 39:43.736
We could've dropped you off anywhere.

39:43.738 --> 39:45.271
Why this dump?

39:45.273 --> 39:49.341
With Jannah gone, this is home.

39:49.343 --> 39:52.578
Oh. Well, you got a lot of heat on you.

39:52.580 --> 39:54.213
I can handle heat.

39:55.616 --> 39:57.016
Thanks.

39:57.018 --> 39:58.584
Wait!

39:58.586 --> 40:00.986
It's not safe for you here.

40:00.988 --> 40:02.321
There's no reason to suggest

40:02.323 --> 40:04.023
that sorceress won't return for you.

40:04.025 --> 40:08.060
Well, it's not like I
have any other options.

40:08.062 --> 40:11.530
That amulet, it's not an amulet.

40:11.532 --> 40:14.700
It's a totem, like mine.

40:14.702 --> 40:16.435
We're bound together somehow,

40:16.437 --> 40:20.372
in a way that I have yet to understand.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.041
Come with us.

40:23.478 --> 40:26.645
That's all nice and weird, but...

40:26.647 --> 40:30.049
Totems, they guide us in strange ways.

40:30.051 --> 40:32.351
What if yours guided you to us?

40:32.353 --> 40:33.686
What would you rather do?

40:33.688 --> 40:35.321
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your whole life

40:35.323 --> 40:38.924
or do something really
stupid, like time travel?

40:38.926 --> 40:41.961
- I'm not a superhero.
- Neither am I.

40:54.742 --> 40:55.875
Good.

40:59.582 --> 41:02.247
_

41:14.328 --> 41:16.395
You can't pedal
forever, you little nerd!

41:16.397 --> 41:17.763
Come on! Come on!

41:18.900 --> 41:21.800
Where are you, nerd?

41:21.802 --> 41:24.203
I think he went down this way!

41:24.205 --> 41:27.072
Come out, come out wherever you are!

41:28.476 --> 41:30.409
He went down here! Down here!

41:35.349 --> 41:36.448
Hello?

41:39.053 --> 41:42.188
Hi, what's your name?

41:43.824 --> 41:45.750
Mine's Ray Palmer.
