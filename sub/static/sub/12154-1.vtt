00:48.937 --> 00:49.965
Synchro: mpm

00:58.064 --> 00:59.614
Be careful with that.

01:00.891 --> 01:03.479
That was our bed, you know, guys?

01:04.759 --> 01:07.685
I had heard that the Israelis
had cornered the moving business

01:07.810 --> 01:12.164
like the Greeks had diners, but it seems
unusual to have Jewish movers,

01:12.289 --> 01:15.282
right,
doing such muscle-oriented work?

01:15.990 --> 01:19.245
What are you,
another self-hating New York Jew?

01:21.044 --> 01:22.107
Yes, I am.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.011
Bye.

02:07.169 --> 02:08.655
Are you sure about this?

02:09.088 --> 02:11.547
You're saying this now,
after the truck is loaded?

02:11.715 --> 02:14.383
I don't know. Yes. I don't know.
I don't want to lose you.

02:14.771 --> 02:16.268
But, see, this is the problem.

02:16.393 --> 02:19.513
It's only because I'm out the door
that you're finally asking me to stop.

02:19.638 --> 02:21.879
It's like you don't take action
until it's too late.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.595
I'm taking action now.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.618
- Don't go.
- Jonathan...

02:26.547 --> 02:28.029
It doesn't matter.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.373
What?

02:29.646 --> 02:32.489
I told you months ago
that if we were gonna make this work

02:32.614 --> 02:34.554
you had to stop drinking
and smoking pot.

02:34.679 --> 02:35.929
And you didn't.

02:36.426 --> 02:37.687
That was our deal.

02:37.812 --> 02:40.433
It's dangerous to go cold turkey.

02:40.558 --> 02:42.164
I'm down to white wine.

02:42.289 --> 02:44.071
I can't help it, all right?

02:44.196 --> 02:46.523
I still like the way
pot makes me think.

02:46.801 --> 02:47.917
Maybe it's healthy.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.543
Pot is not healthy.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.212
They give it to cancer patients.

02:51.525 --> 02:53.125
You don't have cancer.

02:54.156 --> 02:55.156
Not yet.

02:56.768 --> 02:58.015
Goodbye, Jonathan.

02:58.140 --> 02:59.011
Let's go.

02:59.824 --> 03:00.679
Please.

03:03.535 --> 03:04.535
Come on.

03:04.983 --> 03:06.716
I get it, all right?

03:07.750 --> 03:08.750
I'm sorry.

03:09.059 --> 03:10.433
I'm sorry.
I'm crazy.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.908
I'll quit the pot

03:12.424 --> 03:13.874
and the white wine.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.399
She left you?

03:22.524 --> 03:25.643
Yeah. I'm an idiot...
too much pot and white wine.

03:25.768 --> 03:27.498
She was sweet.
I liked her.

03:27.828 --> 03:29.678
But you gotta rebound fast.

03:30.199 --> 03:31.749
That's the best cure.

03:32.008 --> 03:33.254
Go on Craigslist.

03:33.577 --> 03:36.682
Yeah, I don't know.
Maybe it's too soon.

03:36.807 --> 03:39.969
- You know, I feel like...
- Jo, what did you do?

05:08.290 --> 05:09.266
Hey, Ray.

05:10.296 --> 05:12.709
That sucks, man.

05:13.534 --> 05:16.341
- I thought you were mildly unhappy.
- It happened all of a sudden.

05:16.466 --> 05:18.400
She announced the move two days ago.

05:18.525 --> 05:19.925
Are you destroyed?

05:20.050 --> 05:22.112
You gotta be destroyed, right?
Are you destroyed?

05:22.599 --> 05:23.906
Last time I was heartbroken

05:24.171 --> 05:28.163
I felt like someone had put on my head
one of those falcon hoods, you know,

05:28.844 --> 05:30.820
and all I could see
was complete darkness.

05:30.945 --> 05:32.115
A falcon hood?

05:33.278 --> 05:34.875
Anyway, why didn't you tell me?

05:35.374 --> 05:36.809
I thought she was bluffing.

05:36.934 --> 05:40.378
I didn't think she would move out.
And then out of nowhere

05:40.503 --> 05:43.299
these super-efficient Israeli
mover guys show up.

05:43.424 --> 05:47.224
All of a sudden it's like the raid
on Entebbe in my own apartment.

05:48.104 --> 05:50.538
Let me get my computer.
What is the raid on Entebbe?

05:50.976 --> 05:53.477
It's...
It was an Israeli tactical...

05:55.528 --> 05:57.398
group of people...
fuck it, I don't know.

05:57.589 --> 06:00.584
- You used the words "falcon hood".
- I know what a falcon hood is.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.319
Everybody knows what it is.

06:02.529 --> 06:03.643
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:03.768 --> 06:05.925
Falcon hood, anyone?

06:07.261 --> 06:08.561
Raid on Entebbe?

06:10.319 --> 06:11.669
Okay, we're even.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.322
- You think you can get her back?
- I don't think so.

06:14.447 --> 06:16.666
I feel like Suzanne
started to think that I was a loser

06:16.791 --> 06:18.324
because I'm struggling to write.

06:18.449 --> 06:20.587
- I mean, this second novel...
- Yeah, listen,

06:20.756 --> 06:23.797
yesterday Leah was like, "why don't you
go teach art in a public school?"

06:23.922 --> 06:25.705
I'm not gonna teach
art at a public school.

06:25.830 --> 06:27.886
I don't wake up till 11:00 a.m.
"Go teach art."

06:28.315 --> 06:30.806
But if you did teach
it would be a steady income.

06:31.846 --> 06:33.346
Don't be disgusting.

06:34.467 --> 06:37.115
Those women were into us
because we were artists.

06:37.240 --> 06:39.086
And then reality hits

06:39.211 --> 06:42.434
and no money and no real future,
and then, you know...

06:42.891 --> 06:45.389
Leah is gonna break up with me
any minute now.

06:45.514 --> 06:48.463
- I mean, we haven't had sex in weeks.
- We are losers.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.891
We're not losers, okay?

06:51.016 --> 06:53.687
Look, you're gonna be
on my website next week.

06:53.812 --> 06:55.206
I made you a therapist.

06:56.184 --> 06:57.334
Look at that.

06:59.117 --> 07:01.549
I wish you'd made me
someone more heroic.

07:01.674 --> 07:02.924
You are heroic.

07:03.486 --> 07:06.582
Therapists are heroic.
They're the heroes of listening.

07:07.728 --> 07:11.223
Next time give me some big muscles,
some superpowers.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.798
At least in your comic
I could be a hero.

07:14.643 --> 07:17.436
But look at that picture of me.
It's pretty cool, isn't it?

07:32.625 --> 07:33.833
<i>I saw your ad.</i>

07:33.958 --> 07:35.646
What?
What ad?

07:35.771 --> 07:37.456
<i>Craigslist, missing persons.</i>

07:38.866 --> 07:40.514
Yes, of course.
I'm sorry.

07:40.924 --> 07:44.524
Most of my clients are word-of-mouth,
so I forgot about my ad.

07:45.062 --> 07:46.512
How can I help you?

07:46.729 --> 07:49.160
<i>It's about my sister.
I think she's missing.</i>

07:49.386 --> 07:51.006
What do you mean, "you think"?

07:51.131 --> 07:54.089
<i>She hasn't answered her phone
for two days and her voicemail is full.</i>

07:54.214 --> 07:56.558
<i>And I came up from Philadelphia
to go to a concert with her</i>

07:56.727 --> 07:58.093
<i>and she's not in her dorm.</i>

07:58.218 --> 08:00.755
Where are you?
Let's discuss this in person.

08:38.429 --> 08:39.183
Rachel?

08:39.768 --> 08:41.227
- Mr. Ames?
- Yes.

08:41.397 --> 08:42.638
Can I sit down?

08:42.763 --> 08:43.763
Okay.

08:44.073 --> 08:45.632
Very nice to meet you.

08:45.757 --> 08:47.444
I'm glad you found me on Craigslist.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.945
I love Craigslist.
I use it for everything.

08:50.438 --> 08:54.442
I didn't know what to do so I typed
in "missing persons" and found you.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.617
And you said
your rates were reasonable.

08:56.742 --> 08:59.042
They're very reasonable.
They're...

08:59.524 --> 09:01.345
$100 for the day.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.227
- I guess I can afford that.
- Great, okay.

09:04.503 --> 09:07.421
Then down to business.
Do you have a picture of your sister?

09:09.901 --> 09:11.466
Wait, I do on my phone.

09:12.231 --> 09:13.093
Great.

09:18.017 --> 09:20.730
- Who's that?
- Her gross boyfriend Vincent.

09:21.244 --> 09:23.762
What's gross about him
besides that tattoo?

09:23.887 --> 09:24.813
I don't know.

09:24.982 --> 09:27.697
He's english and he's a bartender.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.610
And he's old... like, 30.

09:30.187 --> 09:31.695
That's not old.
I'm 30.

09:33.618 --> 09:35.718
Anyway, they fight all the time.

09:36.489 --> 09:39.120
My sister says even though Vincent
is a total jerk

09:39.314 --> 09:41.121
they have amazing sex.

09:41.669 --> 09:44.289
Guys who are assholes
are always the best at sex.

09:44.414 --> 09:45.414
It sucks.

09:45.711 --> 09:47.547
I don't know
why the world is like that.

09:47.672 --> 09:49.465
But nice guys can be good too...

09:49.590 --> 09:52.591
thoughtful, attentive, just loving.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.786
Whatever.
I think Vincent's a meth head.

09:54.911 --> 09:56.886
And she wanted to break up with him.

09:57.011 --> 09:59.389
And maybe he went homicidal on her.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.765
Breakups can be hard on a guy.

10:02.110 --> 10:02.935
What?

10:03.573 --> 10:05.146
My girlfriend moved out today.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.223
It's actually kind of upsetting.

10:08.378 --> 10:11.072
Are you really a private detective?

10:13.864 --> 10:16.555
I think the thing to do
is find this Vincent.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.775
Find him... we find her.

10:20.235 --> 10:21.370
<i>Cherchez l'homme.</i>

10:22.071 --> 10:23.330
I don't understand you.

10:23.726 --> 10:27.432
Instead of <i>"cherchez la femme"</i>
I'm gonna try something different...

10:27.730 --> 10:29.044
<i>"cherchez l'homme".</i>

10:29.213 --> 10:32.422
- Do you speak French?
- No, I'm taking Spanish.

10:32.650 --> 10:35.684
<i>Espa√±ol.</i>
It means "find the man".

10:43.852 --> 10:45.390
Where did Lisa meet Vincent?

10:45.515 --> 10:48.623
At the bar where he works...
the Parkside Lounge.

10:48.748 --> 10:51.655
Everyone at N.Y.U.
Goes there because they don't card.

10:52.664 --> 10:53.742
Hi, George.

10:53.867 --> 10:56.872
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm working... a job.

10:57.423 --> 11:00.043
<i>Don't forget you're working for me
tonight. It's important.</i>

11:00.168 --> 11:02.481
Right, I know.
I'll be there, okay?

11:05.501 --> 11:07.161
Another case closed.

11:09.406 --> 11:11.406
Are you really a professional?

11:12.282 --> 11:14.576
As I put in my ad, I'm not licensed.

11:15.456 --> 11:17.906
But I will find your sister,
I promise.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.886
I want to help you.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.375
I hope everything will be all right.

11:27.500 --> 11:30.230
This whole thing is really weird.
Don't worry.

11:30.399 --> 11:32.774
Get home.
I'll call you later tonight, okay?

11:33.366 --> 11:34.515
Penn station.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.041
Hey, Niko.

11:53.895 --> 11:55.267
Where have you been?

11:55.392 --> 11:56.742
George is pissed.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.697
- He's drunk already?
- Don't pull that Anglophile bullshit.

11:59.822 --> 12:02.769
He's pissed as in "angry at you."
They party is almost over.

12:02.894 --> 12:04.640
All we've got left
are d-list celebrities

12:04.765 --> 12:06.687
and he wanted good quotes
for the party page.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.746
I know. I'm sorry.
I've had a bad day.

12:08.871 --> 12:10.057
What happened?

12:10.182 --> 12:12.927
Suzanne moved out, broke up with me.

12:13.052 --> 12:15.427
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's all right.

12:15.853 --> 12:17.110
How are you and Sam doing?

12:18.086 --> 12:19.613
Actually, we broke up too.

12:19.916 --> 12:21.537
That's strange...

12:21.662 --> 12:24.409
that we should both be going through
breakups at the same time.

12:24.596 --> 12:26.468
Actually, I'm happier alone.

12:26.593 --> 12:30.274
The only reason to be with somebody
is to have sex, and I don't need sex.

12:30.399 --> 12:33.585
When you're doing it it's okay, but
when you're not it's  what's the point?

12:35.802 --> 12:36.802
I guess.

12:37.575 --> 12:40.225
Here comes George.
I'd better get to work.

12:42.890 --> 12:44.378
Do you have any pot?

12:46.304 --> 12:47.140
Of course.

12:53.726 --> 12:56.108
- That's very clever of you.
- That's what you used to do

12:56.276 --> 12:59.403
- before you quit smoking pot.
- That's why I thought it was clever.

12:59.571 --> 13:01.474
I'm still off pot, by the way,

13:01.599 --> 13:05.045
except when you tempt me,
which is very very bad of you.

13:06.594 --> 13:07.594
What...?

13:08.089 --> 13:09.839
This is my Viagra bottle.

13:10.398 --> 13:13.331
What are you doing with marijuana
in my Viagra bottle?

13:13.502 --> 13:15.951
You gave me that bottle months ago.
There were 2 pills left in it.

13:16.076 --> 13:17.423
You told me I should try.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.798
- Now I'm putting my pot in that...
- Are you insane?

13:20.382 --> 13:23.002
What if you got arrested
for marijuana possession?

13:23.127 --> 13:25.890
"Page six" would have a field day.
I can't have...

13:32.489 --> 13:35.439
I can't have the world knowing
that I use Viagra.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.728
- Do you really need to take so much?
- Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.586
My heart medicine

13:41.035 --> 13:43.585
and my heavy drinking
have taken a toll.

13:44.530 --> 13:46.230
I'm not what I once was.

13:46.798 --> 13:48.365
But I accept that.

13:48.589 --> 13:50.139
It's called humility.

13:51.332 --> 13:53.248
Then why are you back on pot?

13:54.889 --> 13:56.289
Because I'm bored.

13:56.886 --> 13:58.136
God, I'm bored.

13:58.946 --> 14:01.423
Death by 1000 dull conversations.

14:02.127 --> 14:03.800
I don't knowwhat's going on,

14:03.969 --> 14:06.625
but almost everybody
has bad wine breath tonight.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.472
It's like Chernobyl out there.

14:09.092 --> 14:11.124
Do you think we drink too much?

14:11.810 --> 14:13.427
No, we don't drink too much.

14:15.357 --> 14:17.440
Men face reality and women don't.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.024
That's why men need to drink.

14:19.376 --> 14:20.859
That's a line from my novel.

14:21.535 --> 14:23.737
- Yeah, well, you stole it from me.
- No, I didn't.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.298
- Yeah, actually you did.
- Actually no, I didn't.

14:26.423 --> 14:27.922
Fine, Jonathan.

14:28.047 --> 14:29.034
Anyway,

14:29.203 --> 14:31.536
Suzanne moved out today
because, she says, I drink too much.

14:32.019 --> 14:33.719
Well, I'm not surprised.

14:34.513 --> 14:35.707
Why do you say that?

14:36.267 --> 14:38.292
Because you're like me, Jonathan...

14:38.417 --> 14:40.874
We enthrall and then we disappoint.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.673
It used to take me several years.

14:43.842 --> 14:45.475
Now it's a couple of weeks.

14:45.678 --> 14:48.743
If I'm with a woman longer than that
then there's something wrong with her.

14:48.868 --> 14:51.690
But why?
Why are your relationships so short now?

14:56.192 --> 14:58.320
I don't lie as well as I used to,
I guess.

14:58.787 --> 15:00.975
Well, that means you're more honest.

15:10.144 --> 15:13.139
These one-hitters
should really be called three-hitters.

15:14.017 --> 15:16.638
You may steal that line too
if you want.

15:18.294 --> 15:21.121
- I hope that answered your question.
- Thank you.

15:30.410 --> 15:32.648
Parkside Lounge, Manhattan.

15:50.628 --> 15:52.778
Is Vincent Ellis working tonight?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.175
What would you like?

16:10.104 --> 16:11.537
Just some white wine.

16:11.858 --> 16:12.731
No, wait.

16:12.856 --> 16:14.973
Whisky, no ice.

16:28.740 --> 16:29.740
Excuse me.

16:31.075 --> 16:32.389
I called earlier tonight.

16:32.514 --> 16:35.118
Someone told me that Vincent
started working at 9:00.

16:35.287 --> 16:36.559
You spoke to me.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.820
He called a little while ago,
said he wasn't coming in.

16:40.522 --> 16:42.000
Do you know where he might be?

16:53.167 --> 16:54.352
What do you want?

16:54.477 --> 16:57.488
Do you know where he lives?
He's not listed in the phone book.

16:58.186 --> 17:00.352
I'll tell you one thing...
he's not home.

17:01.529 --> 17:04.647
Can you tell me another thing then,
like where he's at?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.771
He's at the velma hotel.

17:06.896 --> 17:09.277
He didn't tell me,
but it came up on the caller I.D.

17:09.953 --> 17:12.618
Thanks for the information.
You've been very helpful.

17:22.046 --> 17:25.962
I've been laying off the whisky.
I've been on a white wine regimen,

17:26.130 --> 17:28.130
trying to save a relationship.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.731
Good for you.

18:00.182 --> 18:02.163
Is there a Vincent Ellis
staying here?

18:07.864 --> 18:08.923
Fuck you.

18:13.165 --> 18:14.865
Have you seen these two?

18:15.660 --> 18:16.594
Fuck you.

18:16.764 --> 18:18.763
Come on, man,
you don't have to curse so much.

18:21.502 --> 18:24.519
Can I sit in the lobby and see if they
come out for cigarettes or something?

18:26.182 --> 18:27.856
No, you can rent a room...

18:28.025 --> 18:29.858
$60 for three hours,
$90 for the night.

18:30.077 --> 18:31.860
You do that...
you can sit in that chair.

18:36.879 --> 18:39.629
Do people use their real names
in this place?

19:22.711 --> 19:24.496
Did I Miss anything?
Did they go out?

19:25.299 --> 19:26.449
Don't say it.

19:28.088 --> 19:29.042
I saw the man.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.586
He went out and came back in already...
with beer.

19:32.470 --> 19:34.660
- Wait, what about the girl?
- No girl.

19:35.009 --> 19:36.635
What room is he staying in?

19:39.626 --> 19:40.512
313.

19:58.746 --> 20:00.615
What the hell is going on out here?

20:00.930 --> 20:02.492
Nothing.
I'm sorry.

20:04.302 --> 20:05.902
You want a date, baby?

20:06.263 --> 20:08.206
I just had a client cancel on me.

20:09.355 --> 20:11.481
You know, I can't right now,

20:12.249 --> 20:13.449
but thank you.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.720
- What the fuck is going on?
- Are you Vincent Ellis?

20:23.432 --> 20:25.014
It's okay.
I'm here to help you.

20:25.184 --> 20:27.016
Your sister sent me.
Everything is fine.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.977
- I'm a private detective.
- What?

20:30.564 --> 20:31.517
Wait.

20:31.943 --> 20:33.731
- Get out of my room.
- Put that out.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.193
- Get out of our room.
- Put that out. Put that out, come on.

20:37.363 --> 20:39.445
Get out of our fucking room.

20:50.935 --> 20:52.834
Who the fuck is calling you?

20:53.458 --> 20:55.920
Can you wait one second, please?
It's my boss calling.

20:56.092 --> 20:58.627
I'm gonna answer it.
He hates if I don't answer it.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.207
I'm craving marijuana.
I can't sleep.

21:03.389 --> 21:04.890
You got me started again.

21:05.015 --> 21:06.180
Can you come over?

21:06.392 --> 21:08.574
Don't blame me.
You're the one who asked for pot.

21:08.699 --> 21:11.561
- But I can't come over right now.
- <i>Don't be a milquetoast.</i>

21:11.730 --> 21:14.105
Where are you, Brooklyn?
Hop in a car service.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.311
<i>I'll pay.</i>

21:17.933 --> 21:20.361
Are you at a party?
Are there women?

21:20.531 --> 21:21.531
Get out.

21:22.990 --> 21:23.865
I have to go.

21:24.034 --> 21:26.226
- No, I'll come to you.
- I have to go. Bye.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.924
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm a private detective.

21:29.049 --> 21:31.748
Rachel Klein asked me to look for Lisa.
Why is she tied to the bed?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.737
I don't believe you're a detective.

21:33.862 --> 21:36.377
I'm not a licensed
private detective.

21:36.652 --> 21:37.802
I'm a writer.

21:41.168 --> 21:42.425
What kind of writer?

21:42.594 --> 21:44.010
A novelist, some journalism.

21:44.854 --> 21:48.473
I've been struggling with my 2nd novel.
They're the hardest to write.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.633
I write.

21:50.068 --> 21:51.568
Yeah, I write songs.

21:52.443 --> 21:54.373
It's really what I want to do
with my life.

21:54.498 --> 21:55.598
That's cool.

21:56.766 --> 21:57.910
But listen,

21:58.035 --> 21:59.567
what's going on?

21:59.737 --> 22:01.277
Lisa's sister is really worried.

22:01.447 --> 22:03.174
They were supposed
to go to a concert.

22:03.299 --> 22:05.599
Well, I'll tell you what's going on.

22:05.944 --> 22:07.494
She broke up with me.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.463
- I try to put things back together.
- Really?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.634
My girlfriend broke up with me.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.654
She moved out today.

22:14.779 --> 22:16.129
I'm pretty upset.

22:16.465 --> 22:18.112
And you just let her go?

22:19.214 --> 22:20.514
That's not cool.

22:20.942 --> 22:22.924
You have to be a man
when that happens.

22:26.131 --> 22:27.581
Yeah, I let her go.

22:28.105 --> 22:30.932
Why is Lisa tied to the bed?
I don't like the looks of that.

22:32.199 --> 22:33.619
Who are you to judge?

22:33.744 --> 22:36.479
We're role-playing...
the Stockholm syndrome.

22:36.787 --> 22:39.232
That's why we got this sleazy room...
to make it authentic.

22:40.488 --> 22:43.027
I've always been intrigued
by the Stockholm syndrome.

22:43.421 --> 22:45.167
It makes me think of my childhood.

22:46.408 --> 22:49.847
She's supposed to fall in love
with her captor... here fall back.

22:51.337 --> 22:53.087
I should have tried that.

22:54.619 --> 22:55.623
Can I come out?

22:57.837 --> 22:58.793
All right.

22:58.963 --> 23:00.628
But you'd better be cool.

23:07.781 --> 23:09.137
What's that smell?

23:09.616 --> 23:10.616
Meth.

23:10.976 --> 23:13.934
Come on, man, you can't smoke meth.
It's all chemicals.

23:14.059 --> 23:16.394
I have pot. It's natural.
It's better for you.

23:16.684 --> 23:17.770
Can I have a hit?

23:20.731 --> 23:21.898
Do you want a hit?

23:22.023 --> 23:23.943
Can we take the washcloth
out of her mouth?

23:24.762 --> 23:27.030
No, we need to stay in our roles.

23:28.099 --> 23:29.782
She still wants to break up with me

23:29.952 --> 23:32.103
and I really don't want
to hear about it.

23:33.642 --> 23:35.180
My girlfriend broke up with me

23:35.305 --> 23:38.645
because, she says, I smoke too much pot
and drink too much white wine.

23:38.770 --> 23:39.860
She's right.

23:40.456 --> 23:43.311
How can you love someone
if you're in a fog the whole time?

23:46.618 --> 23:48.022
You want a hit of meth?

23:48.816 --> 23:50.999
- I've never, but if...
- Police!

23:51.124 --> 23:51.983
Shit.

23:52.528 --> 23:54.515
- Coming.
- Open up.

23:54.973 --> 23:56.225
Get rid of this.

24:09.957 --> 24:11.342
Can I help you, officers?

24:11.467 --> 24:13.686
There was some kind of fight
going on up in there.

24:13.811 --> 24:14.702
Excuse me.

24:23.037 --> 24:25.088
- Are these two men abusing you?
- I'm fine.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.990
They're not abusing me.

24:27.292 --> 24:29.133
That is my ex-boyfriend.

24:29.314 --> 24:30.343
Don't say that.

24:30.725 --> 24:33.096
But I don't even know
who that guy is.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.241
I think
there's something wrong with him.

24:36.366 --> 24:39.352
- Step out in the hallway, sir.
- I was just trying to help.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.510
- I'm a writer.
- Let's go.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.255
So let me ask you...

24:52.216 --> 24:53.950
Why'd you pull
this Craigslist stunt?

24:54.635 --> 24:56.828
- For the money?
- No, not at all.

24:57.264 --> 24:58.692
I wasn't in my right mind.

24:58.817 --> 25:02.250
- My girlfriend just broke up with me.
- I don't to hear about your love life.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.196
I lost money on this whole thing.

25:04.321 --> 25:06.546
I forgot to tell the little sister
about expenses.

25:06.715 --> 25:09.966
In the books I've read the private
detective always asks for expenses.

25:10.135 --> 25:13.050
I've spent $80 on bribes,
$60 on a hotel...

25:13.175 --> 25:14.539
all right, shut up.

25:14.673 --> 25:15.513
Listen.

25:15.683 --> 25:17.561
You didn't actually break any laws.

25:17.686 --> 25:20.757
And the girl and her boyfriend
are not filing a complaint after all.

25:21.669 --> 25:23.187
So we'll do some paperwork...

25:23.357 --> 25:25.982
I'm not breaking up, but you had better
get that tattoo changed.

25:26.161 --> 25:28.484
I'm sick of looking
at that "Lisa" right on your belly.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.000
It's your name.

25:30.385 --> 25:31.654
But that's the other Lisa.

25:32.026 --> 25:34.055
Can you wait one second, sir?

25:37.177 --> 25:39.418
Call your sister
and let her know you're all right.

25:39.543 --> 25:42.593
- Or I can call her...
- I already called her, asshole.

25:47.933 --> 25:50.673
- Thanks for not pressing charges.
- What is your problem?

25:52.134 --> 25:54.366
Don't you ever pull
a stunt like this again.

25:54.491 --> 25:57.471
If you go back on that Craigslist
and impersonate an investigator,

25:57.641 --> 25:58.919
you'll end up in Rikers.

25:59.044 --> 26:01.851
And I don't see you thriving
in that environment.

26:21.761 --> 26:23.289
We gotta sit outside.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.549
Some early-morning
post-natal yoga class exploded.

26:28.674 --> 26:30.557
It's like a nursery in there.
I got you coffee.

26:30.682 --> 26:31.682
Thank you.

26:31.807 --> 26:34.717
I'm glad you called me 'cause I want
to talk to you about something too.

26:34.925 --> 26:38.429
You can go first, but I gotta tell you
I had really wild night last night.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.916
Let me go first and then you, okay?

26:41.310 --> 26:43.328
So I'm at Leah's last night.
I'm lying in bed.

26:43.453 --> 26:45.269
I'm waiting for her
to put her kids to sleep.

26:45.439 --> 26:48.814
Last night was supposed to be the night
that we broke our cold streak sexwise.

26:49.354 --> 26:51.150
So she's putting her kids to sleep

26:51.320 --> 26:53.546
and I'm thinking,
"I want to be put to sleep.

26:53.709 --> 26:56.656
I want to be tucked in. I want to be
the only child in a woman's life."

26:56.829 --> 26:58.059
I'm waiting and waiting.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.409
She finally comes to the bedroom
around 10:30 and she goes,

27:00.579 --> 27:03.686
"Can I shut my eyes for 10 minutes?"
That turns into the rest of the night.

27:03.811 --> 27:06.707
- She passed out cold.
- That's terrible, but can I tell you?

27:06.877 --> 27:08.421
You would not believe.

27:09.046 --> 27:10.086
Do you want...?

27:10.255 --> 27:12.255
- No, if you're not...
- Okay, just let me...

27:12.424 --> 27:14.882
So then I leave around 1:00 a.m.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.235
She's been calling me,
"How can you abandon me?

27:17.360 --> 27:20.117
"How can you be so insensitive
to my abandonment issues?"

27:20.337 --> 27:22.306
And there's only so much that,
you know...

27:22.881 --> 27:25.059
It sounds so awful,
but listen to me.

27:25.408 --> 27:28.062
- I got into a really... what?
- There's Leah.

27:28.187 --> 27:29.137
What?

27:35.704 --> 27:39.385
How dare you leave me in the middle
of the night like a one-night stand?

27:39.510 --> 27:41.319
One-night stand?
I wish it was.

27:41.444 --> 27:43.119
You should have stayed and held me.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.946
What, am I a hot-water bottle?

27:45.071 --> 27:46.539
I'm a man.
I have needs.

27:46.749 --> 27:48.207
You call this monogamy?

27:48.377 --> 27:49.714
I call it celibacy.

27:49.994 --> 27:51.431
Those are big words for you.

27:51.556 --> 27:53.796
Did you read them
in one of your comic books?

27:56.109 --> 27:57.716
I read them in my diary.

28:40.054 --> 28:41.862
{\Need your help.
Please call me.}

28:41.987 --> 28:43.637
{\Any time day or night.
I need help.}

28:56.233 --> 28:57.449
Jane lessing?

28:57.574 --> 28:58.774
Jonathan ames.

29:00.132 --> 29:02.182
Yeah, I believe I can help you.
