WEBVTT

00:06.548 --> 00:08.299
[chirping]

00:09.801 --> 00:11.761
I want to say to everyone,

00:11.845 --> 00:14.556
and this actually includes
any crew that's here,

00:14.639 --> 00:16.141
including even the camera people,

00:16.224 --> 00:18.226
that we're all in the field.

00:20.061 --> 00:23.815
If you have feelings that aren't
your own, don't be worried,

00:24.399 --> 00:29.779
but if you feel heavy
or tired or angry or sad,

00:29.863 --> 00:32.866
let it come through you
and make yourself permeable.

00:34.159 --> 00:38.163
The only time it's difficult
is if we resist it, so don't resist.

00:38.246 --> 00:42.167
Allow it to come through,
and you'll be fine. It'll move through.

00:42.250 --> 00:43.585
You're gonna see.

00:47.797 --> 00:51.342
There's always ways
to optimize your relationship

00:51.426 --> 00:54.387
by being accountable yourself.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.306
Particularly newer relationships,

00:56.389 --> 01:00.226
one aspect in communication
is learning how

01:00.310 --> 01:04.272
to not trigger
somebody else's insecurities

01:04.355 --> 01:06.441
or traumas or things like that.

01:07.067 --> 01:11.571
When you commit to the process,
we can really grow as people,

01:11.654 --> 01:15.492
and we can really become
the next best versions of ourselves.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.119
-I mean, this has been amazing already.
-Yeah.

01:18.203 --> 01:23.583
I'm recognizing so much that
we have in common with all of you.

01:23.666 --> 01:26.211
I think we've been together
the least amount of time.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.963
-Hi, I'm Sera.
-I'm Dash.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.008
And we've been together
for a year and a half.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.554
[Sera] We'd seen each other
out at, like, queer parties.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.681
-I wasn't ready to, like, hit on Sera.
-[laughs]

01:38.765 --> 01:42.727
I have no problem hitting on somebody,
but, like, I just wasn't quite ready.

01:42.811 --> 01:45.647
But then we had this moment
on the dance floor which--

01:45.730 --> 01:46.689
[Sera] The week later.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.983
When we met and our love was so special,

01:49.067 --> 01:51.194
I was like, "Wow, we really
have to put in the work."

01:51.277 --> 01:54.447
I never saw, like, a queer couple
walking around that I could be like,

01:54.531 --> 01:56.533
"Oh, that's, like, what I could be like."

01:56.616 --> 01:57.575
We didn't have that.

01:57.659 --> 02:00.328
I'm really proud
of who we are as a couple.

02:00.995 --> 02:06.376
We both have been married, uh, prior to
being together, and gone through divorces.

02:06.876 --> 02:12.006
You know, for me, I have a tendency,
when things start to feel emotional,

02:12.090 --> 02:15.635
to get really scared,
and I can be a little bit avoidant.

02:15.718 --> 02:19.973
I have a history of doing that,
and I don't want to do that with Sera.

02:20.515 --> 02:24.102
You know, I came to Dash
with, like, a really bad track record.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.479
Like, I was…
You know, sex and love addict,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.315
um, left relationships by cheating.

02:29.941 --> 02:30.984
Completely avoidant.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.403
And when we met, I was like,

02:33.486 --> 02:37.699
I'd had a tutor all through school,
why didn't I have a tutor or help in love?

02:37.782 --> 02:41.744
And amazing that you're both
so aware of your stuff so early.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.455
I mean, it's like the old adage about

02:45.248 --> 02:47.792
starting to dig a well
when you're already thirsty.

02:47.876 --> 02:50.420
It's like you guys are…
"Let's dig the well now

02:50.503 --> 02:53.631
so that when we get thirsty,
it's there and we have that resource."

02:53.715 --> 02:54.716
That's amazing to see.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.259
-Thank you.
-[Michaela] Yeah.

02:56.342 --> 03:00.805
I'm really, really excited for them.
They both know it's time to go deeper.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.806
Right.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.309
We recognize it is still,
you know, honeymoon time.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.685
Mushy-crushy.

03:05.768 --> 03:09.355
-We also know--
-I know, the eye contact is mesmerizing.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.150
-I was gonna point it out to you.
-[all laughing]

03:12.233 --> 03:14.027
Sera told me…

03:14.110 --> 03:18.531
And this has stuck with me ever since.
She was like, "I get bored easily."

03:18.615 --> 03:21.284
Like, "You better keep it fun."

03:21.367 --> 03:26.664
As a person who, you know, has
a fear of being, like, left, um,

03:26.748 --> 03:27.790
that's scary.

03:27.874 --> 03:32.712
You know, like, what if things
get too hard and she bounces?

03:32.795 --> 03:35.673
I'm obsessed with Sera.
We're both obsessed with each other.

03:35.757 --> 03:38.676
[Gwyneth] Yours is
clearly not a sex issue.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.094
[laughs]

03:40.178 --> 03:43.389
[Dash] We adore one another
and are really madly in love.

03:43.473 --> 03:46.976
We haven't made things always work
in the past, in past relationships.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.771
-You don't wanna fuck it up.
-[Dash] We don't wanna fuck it up.

03:49.854 --> 03:51.940
You know, I've been good
at fucking up in the past.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.483
[Gwyneth] Yeah. Same.

03:53.566 --> 03:56.027
I feel you. I think we're…
I was listening to you like,

03:56.110 --> 03:59.113
"Avoidant, have a hard time
being vulnerable." It's like…

03:59.197 --> 04:02.450
[Dash] I'm sure that
a lot of that comes from my own trauma.

04:02.533 --> 04:03.534
I believe, you know…

04:03.618 --> 04:05.286
-We know trauma is passed down.
-Yeah.

04:05.370 --> 04:10.041
Whatever we can learn about
our history or historical lines

04:10.124 --> 04:13.461
that could, like, give us more insight
into, like, who we are as people

04:13.544 --> 04:18.299
and, like, why we feel the way we do,
or maybe have the reactions that we have,

04:18.383 --> 04:20.843
to help us grow more as a couple.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.554
Like, I think that goop can do that for us

04:23.638 --> 04:26.724
and can provide us
with that type of experience.

04:26.808 --> 04:31.562
You know, I can probably be a little
more skeptical to alternative therapy,

04:31.646 --> 04:35.191
uh, but I'm open to it,
and I'd love to see what happens.

04:35.275 --> 04:39.988
["Gnossienne No. 1 (A Cappella)"
by James Oxborrow playing"]

04:49.789 --> 04:51.541
My name is Katarina Wittich.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.252
Kato is my nickname,
which is what everybody calls me.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.671
And I'm a Family
Constellations facilitator.

04:57.588 --> 05:01.092
Family Constellations is a group practice

05:01.175 --> 05:06.597
that helps investigate what it is
that's stuck in an individual's life,

05:06.681 --> 05:11.561
and it does it not by talk therapy
or thinking or trying to figure out,

05:11.644 --> 05:14.939
but it does it by using
other members of a group

05:15.023 --> 05:17.900
to represent members
of your family of origin,

05:17.984 --> 05:20.153
so that you can see, literally,

05:20.236 --> 05:22.905
the patterns that led
to you being who you are.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.241
[softly drumming]

05:25.325 --> 05:28.661
So, the thing about Family Constellations
is it was created by Bert Hellinger,

05:28.745 --> 05:32.790
who was a Jesuit priest, a psychoanalyst,

05:32.874 --> 05:37.003
and he went and he lived with the Zulu
for about 16 years as a missionary.

05:37.086 --> 05:41.257
And in living with them,
he, as a very Western human,

05:41.341 --> 05:45.678
experienced a very different world,
because in the Zulu healing ceremonies,

05:45.762 --> 05:51.893
healing happens in interdependent,
intergenerational group reality.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.311
It doesn't happen just solo.

05:53.936 --> 05:58.358
So he took this experience
that he had and he created this work.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.194
And the way that
that looks is that normally,

06:01.277 --> 06:05.031
we will sit in a circle with
all these people that we call "resonators"

06:05.114 --> 06:08.951
because they're going to be
available to resonate for the client.

06:09.035 --> 06:11.079
Anyone can be a resonator.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.124
We keep all information
away from the resonators.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.461
I and the client are the only two
with the actual information.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.254
Nobody else knows anything

06:20.338 --> 06:24.634
so that they can allow things that
are not their own come through them.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.101
The grand adventure begins.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.519
[chuckling]

06:34.602 --> 06:36.104
It's really exciting to be here.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.606
It's really exciting,
Dash and Sera, that you're

06:39.607 --> 06:44.320
so openly willing to start this voyage
that is not like anything else.

06:44.821 --> 06:49.617
I really hope that it will
give you this deep relationship,

06:49.700 --> 06:51.869
and that the main thing
that gets in the way

06:51.953 --> 06:54.163
of our having relationships that flourish

06:54.247 --> 06:58.209
is the patterns that come down
to us through our ancestors,

06:58.292 --> 07:01.587
through our family system,
through our family culture,

07:02.171 --> 07:07.343
and each of us separately has our patterns
that have come down from our family.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.680
So, we're not gonna work
with the two of you together,

07:10.763 --> 07:16.060
because it's all about individuation
so that you can love and connect well.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.355
So, we will do
two separate constellations,

07:19.439 --> 07:20.565
one for each of you.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.401
That said, Dash, are you ready?

07:23.484 --> 07:24.610
Yeah.

07:24.694 --> 07:25.528
Come on.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.198
[Dash] My parents didn't talk a lot
about our family history growing up.

07:29.282 --> 07:32.702
It would be nice to know
if the patterns that I have

07:32.785 --> 07:34.454
have been handed down from them.

07:35.079 --> 07:37.748
You're going to pick someone
to resonate for you.

07:37.832 --> 07:41.294
Everyone in my family
is avoidant like… like me.

07:41.377 --> 07:44.797
I've always been a person that's like,
you gotta kind of earn my trust.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.507
I have a lot of judgment,

07:46.591 --> 07:51.929
the voice inside my head, when you talk
to yourself and you're like, "You idiot."

07:52.013 --> 07:54.223
And I can be very, very hard on myself.

07:54.307 --> 07:59.270
I do feel like that extends probably
to other people, or they pick up on it.

07:59.353 --> 08:04.400
I don't think I really ever understood
the distance that I had from that.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.736
And there's just something
kind of underlying.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.532
[Kato] When you pick your person
who's gonna resonate for you,

08:11.616 --> 08:15.119
you can pick and choose
anyone of the group.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.414
So, just feel into, in your body,

08:18.498 --> 08:22.627
how it would feel to be in the world
the way you'd like to be.

08:23.377 --> 08:28.466
Dash wanted very clearly to get rid
of these criticisms in their head.

08:28.549 --> 08:31.886
And we don't say mean things
to ourselves for no reason.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.889
We say mean things to ourselves
because it's a survival strategy.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.226
It helps Dash stay separate,

08:39.101 --> 08:43.564
not get too immersed in an other.

08:43.648 --> 08:46.859
So, Dash put their hands
on their resonator,

08:46.943 --> 08:50.863
and they felt into what it would feel like
in their body to just feel

08:50.947 --> 08:53.032
how Dash experiences the world.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.244
So, what are you feeling, Soo Hyun?

08:57.078 --> 08:59.664
Wow, like… [imitates heart pounding]

09:01.666 --> 09:04.961
I wanna get a little grounded,
'cause I feel like everything's going up.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.462
Like everything's going up.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.423
So, it's like just trying
to sort of find my feet again.

09:10.383 --> 09:14.011
Like, a lot of everything is happening,
feels like it's here.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.639
Like, it's like a flickering,
a constant energy,

09:16.722 --> 09:21.310
a lot of energy flow right across here,
but it feels so concentrated.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.230
So even when I close or open it,

09:24.313 --> 09:26.732
it's hard for me
to feel the rest of my body.

09:27.900 --> 09:28.734
[Kato] Yeah.

09:28.818 --> 09:30.945
This sounds familiar? Yes.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.321
Yeah.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.615
I tried to not put
too much thought into who I picked.

09:34.699 --> 09:36.826
I felt like whatever's
meant to happen was gonna happen,

09:36.909 --> 09:38.578
and I just kinda went to her.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.289
And then I sat down,

09:41.872 --> 09:46.711
and she said a couple of things,
and it really tripped me out.

09:46.794 --> 09:50.381
I could right away tell that,
like, that's… She was me.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.509
[Kato] We put in Dash's resonator,

09:53.593 --> 09:58.723
who immediately showed
the discomfort, the lack of safety.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.100
So, we knew, "Okay, we know exactly…"

10:01.183 --> 10:04.812
"This person is showing us exactly
how it is for Dash in the world."

10:05.438 --> 10:06.606
So…

10:06.689 --> 10:09.483
[whispering] So, let's have you
pick someone to be your mom.

10:10.985 --> 10:15.948
[Kato] Resonators, they have absolutely
no idea which family member they're being,

10:16.032 --> 10:18.159
so they can't shape things by knowing.

10:19.744 --> 10:22.288
So, do you notice that person, Soo Hyun?

10:22.371 --> 10:25.291
Yeah, there's definitely,
like, heat and tingling.

10:30.379 --> 10:34.216
Well, I feel I must avert my eyes.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.261
I feel I must keep my chin up.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.685
My job is to make sure no one affects me.

10:44.769 --> 10:47.396
-[Kato] Yeah.
-No one's gonna affect me.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.901
So, I feel kind of sorry for you…

10:53.944 --> 10:55.071
that you need that.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.949
[Kato] And what happens
when she says that, Angie?

10:59.909 --> 11:00.910
[Angela] Well…

11:02.036 --> 11:05.915
I feel humiliated,
because she feels sorry for me.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.917
I didn't think that was really…

11:08.876 --> 11:11.045
Like, why would anyone feel sorry for me?

11:14.298 --> 11:19.178
[whispering] So, what's really clear
is her sense of unsafety as well, right?

11:19.261 --> 11:22.515
So, I think we need to put
her mother in behind her.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.603
The greatest mystery
of Family Constellations

11:27.687 --> 11:29.105
is what I call the field.

11:29.188 --> 11:32.566
I call it the field because
I need one word to talk about it,

11:32.650 --> 11:34.068
and it needs to be easy.

11:34.151 --> 11:38.114
I have no idea what it is.
I only know it works.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.033
As a resonator,
you don't know what the facts are,

11:41.117 --> 11:44.036
so they can't shape things by knowing.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.581
And what happens is feelings come
through you that are not your own.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.838
So, what's happening for you, Angie?
Do you feel that person who came in?

11:53.921 --> 11:57.341
Even though I was more upset,

11:58.092 --> 12:01.095
I actually feel better
with more connection,

12:02.138 --> 12:05.057
and I keep thinking I'm put together.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.184
If I can just stay put together,

12:07.727 --> 12:10.771
you know, maybe I can be okay
with a little more connection.

12:11.355 --> 12:16.485
Relate that also to how, for you,
there's that needing to control the panic.

12:16.569 --> 12:20.322
She's basically saying the same thing,
the needing to control the panic,

12:20.406 --> 12:21.991
then she can have connection.

12:22.074 --> 12:26.412
But, so we're already seeing,
sort of, an origin of it in her…

12:26.495 --> 12:27.496
One hundred percent.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.789
[Kato] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:29.832 --> 12:35.296
In that moment, what the mother was doing
was exactly what Dash does.

12:35.379 --> 12:38.257
Controlling things,
making sure it was okay,

12:38.340 --> 12:42.803
not being okay with being
fully present and not protecting.

12:42.887 --> 12:46.515
So, then we know that
if a mother feels unsafe

12:46.599 --> 12:49.935
and has to control like that,
that something happened to her.

12:51.061 --> 12:52.605
Well, don't laugh at me.

12:56.817 --> 13:01.071
Maybe I'll agree to sit down,
but that doesn't mean I'm make-believing.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.409
[Kato] So, we put in
the mother of Dash's mother.

13:05.493 --> 13:07.495
That mother sure didn't act like a mother.

13:07.578 --> 13:11.040
Like, right from the start,
that mother acted like a little kid,

13:11.123 --> 13:14.752
which indicates that
the trauma happened really young,

13:14.835 --> 13:17.379
that something happened
really young that was not okay.

13:18.672 --> 13:20.716
What do you do
with a kid to try to figure out

13:20.800 --> 13:23.010
what's happening, why they're like that?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.720
[chuckles] You put in their mother,

13:24.804 --> 13:26.722
and you see
what happens with their mother.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.642
So, Ava, what are you feeling?

13:30.893 --> 13:31.769
I… [sighs]

13:31.852 --> 13:36.398
I'm not feeling a lot of emotions
towards anyone, because I just…

13:37.274 --> 13:41.195
I don't feel like I'm in it.
Like, I just feel like I'm above it.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.741
It's obvious that something…
That there was still something behind.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.702
And we actually put in
their mother and father.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.415
I want… I want him.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.751
-[Kato] You want him?
-[Miven] Mm-hmm.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.003
I feel like I'm losing them.

13:59.004 --> 13:59.922
[Kato] Yeah.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.549
Like I… Like I can't--

14:01.632 --> 14:03.801
-[Kato] You're losing them.
-I've lost. I'm losing.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.178
-There's lost feelings around him.
-[Kato] Yeah.

14:06.929 --> 14:12.351
[Dash] Starting to go kind of down
my maternal line was just

14:12.434 --> 14:13.727
really eye-opening.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.981
I don't know anything about my grandma,
really, when she was young,

14:17.064 --> 14:19.984
and I'm now witnessing
her with her parents.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.652
My great-grandparents' coming out.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.487
It just doesn't feel right.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.489
I don't even like the way she's sitting.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.493
[Kato] Mm. Yeah, look at that.

14:30.452 --> 14:35.165
[Dash] Seeing them sort of
distance themself a little bit from her,

14:35.249 --> 14:40.671
that just started to give
additional information about these people,

14:40.754 --> 14:43.632
building on these little bits
and pieces that I've known,

14:43.716 --> 14:46.385
that really put things
in a different perspective.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.889
[Kato] And what are you doing there?

14:52.725 --> 14:54.268
[Camilo] I think she's all fucked up.

14:54.351 --> 14:56.896
Like, I need to… Yeah, I need to be away.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.024
Really toxic.
I don't even want to hear them talking.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.567
So, I'm over here.

15:02.735 --> 15:03.736
[Kato] Yeah.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.698
-[Kato] Yeah.
-She needs to get up and get out of there.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.782
[Kato] Right.

15:09.867 --> 15:10.868
Right.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.204
Then I don't have a mom.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.289
[Kato] Yeah.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.835
I'm not really a mom.

15:20.794 --> 15:23.422
[Dash whispering] 
If I'm remembering correctly,

15:23.505 --> 15:25.925
both of them almost died during childbirth.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.636
Because there was something that went wrong
during the birth.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.597
[whispering] Do you know,
since she almost died giving birth to her…

15:31.680 --> 15:34.016
Do you know
whether there was a separation?

15:34.099 --> 15:37.353
Do you know what happened after that?
Was she hospitalized?

15:37.978 --> 15:40.064
Yeah, I mean, likely. Yeah.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.400
-I mean, it fits the picture. But… Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.781
[Kato] Dash said, you know, "That mother
and baby almost died in pregnancy."

15:48.864 --> 15:51.367
And that, for me,

15:51.450 --> 15:56.372
was the piece that flows through,
straight through to Dash,

15:56.455 --> 15:59.667
because there's no greater trauma
than almost dying giving birth

15:59.750 --> 16:02.544
and having your baby almost die.

16:02.628 --> 16:08.050
So, it may be that
all of this anxiety, hyper-vigilance,

16:08.133 --> 16:13.305
just comes from this simple fact that
that mother and baby almost died.

16:13.389 --> 16:18.310
Once that started to change, other things
down the road started to change.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.937
And that's how it works.

16:20.020 --> 16:25.275
How would it feel to look at Miven
and say, "You're my daughter"?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.235
You're my daughter.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.364
[Kato] "And my mental illness
is my mental illness."

16:30.447 --> 16:32.032
"You don't have to carry it."

16:32.616 --> 16:34.952
And my mental illness
is my mental illness.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.787
You don't have to carry it.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.044
[Kato] The ability to be in relationship,

16:44.128 --> 16:49.341
the ability to stand in yourself and
love someone else and see them clearly

16:49.425 --> 16:53.345
is dependent on you feeling
safe enough to see outside of yourself.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.306
The possibility that opened up for Dash

16:56.390 --> 17:00.936
is for Dash to no longer
carry this family pattern.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.856
So, we're gonna do a closing circle.

17:03.939 --> 17:07.818
Feel like you guys are gonna need
an exorcism from my family out of your…

17:07.901 --> 17:08.986
[chuckling]

17:09.069 --> 17:14.324
So, we thank Dash for bringing
their family system into the field,

17:14.408 --> 17:17.578
and we bow to the wisdom of the field,

17:17.661 --> 17:22.082
and we leave the past where it belongs,
supporting us, behind us,

17:22.166 --> 17:25.169
and we turn and
we move forward into the future.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.378
Yay!

17:27.129 --> 17:30.632
You know, in my life, I've had a, sort of…

17:30.716 --> 17:35.512
It's felt like an innate
wanting to run away from emotion.

17:35.596 --> 17:42.061
So this line I'm witnessing and getting
to step out and watch with everybody,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.313
this, um, this sort of…

17:46.023 --> 17:48.734
keeping each other at a bit of a distance,

17:48.817 --> 17:53.572
and not being able
to really hold each other,

17:53.655 --> 17:58.660
and, um, and comfort one another…

18:00.245 --> 18:02.664
It just totally… Like, I see it.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.918
I see it really clearly,
and I see how it affected

18:06.001 --> 18:08.003
in a way that I hope to break,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.589
because I want that closeness with people.

18:10.672 --> 18:11.799
Mm-hmm.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.343
-[Kato] That's… that's the future.
-[Dash] Mm-hmm.

18:15.552 --> 18:17.429
I think one of the big problems is that

18:18.013 --> 18:20.724
people aren't conscious
of the patterns they're repeating.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.852
When people get educated

18:23.936 --> 18:27.689
around, uh, what patterns
they pick up from their parents,

18:27.773 --> 18:32.027
they often have
huge "aha" moments, right?

18:32.111 --> 18:36.740
So, we get a series of imprints
from our upbringing,

18:36.824 --> 18:42.871
and specifically, we get an imprint
from how we were first loved.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.248
-Oh boy.
-Yes.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.793
Then, you are either going
to rebel against that or want that.

18:47.876 --> 18:51.338
Right. Whether it's… We experience it,
positively or negatively.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.422
[Michaela] Or negatively.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.467
In Family Constellation work,
you get to see it,

18:55.551 --> 18:58.095
examining what your parents did,

18:58.178 --> 19:03.100
looking at previous relationships
and how they ended or what played out.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.562
And so over time, you can really
understand what you're doing.

19:06.645 --> 19:08.939
-Yes.
-Which is really, really amazing.

19:09.022 --> 19:11.024
[percussive music playing]

19:15.154 --> 19:16.905
[interviewer]
How did you get into this work?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.031
[laughs]

19:18.615 --> 19:23.370
So, I'm one of those children, you know,
who really needed to know everything,

19:23.453 --> 19:28.250
understand everything, and I come from
a very intellectual, very rational family.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.087
But I knew that
I was hurting all the time.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.673
So I started looking for,
"How do I have a better life?"

19:36.175 --> 19:39.094
And I knew someone
who kept bugging me and saying,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.264
"Ah, Kato, you gotta come
see this amazing work."

19:42.347 --> 19:44.516
And I went and I watched a constellation

19:44.600 --> 19:49.313
in which a complete stranger
echoed in somebody's family

19:49.396 --> 19:51.148
a twin brother and a death

19:51.231 --> 19:54.151
and all these things
that they couldn't have ever known.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.777
And that was it. It was just like,

19:55.861 --> 19:59.781
"Okay. I don't know what that is,
but I have to know what that is."

19:59.865 --> 20:03.202
And I started going
to constellations and resonating,

20:03.285 --> 20:07.289
and every time I resonated,
I could feel myself change.

20:07.372 --> 20:11.793
I decided I have to learn how to do this,
partly, because I'm such a skeptic

20:11.877 --> 20:14.504
that I don't trust anything
anyone else does,

20:14.588 --> 20:19.009
and I am less "woo-woo" than every
constellations facilitator that I've met.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.679
So, for me,
my doubt quotient had to be fulfilled.

20:22.763 --> 20:25.140
I had to know there was no manipulation,

20:25.224 --> 20:28.602
and the only way I could know that
was if I was actually running it myself.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.063
So, are you ready?

20:31.146 --> 20:32.773
Yeah. I'm excited. [giggles]

20:32.856 --> 20:33.690
[Kato giggles]

20:41.573 --> 20:43.659
Growing up, my dad had an affair.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.204
My mom and dad just split.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.332
I sort of became my mom's main focus,

20:50.415 --> 20:53.293
and, you know, I am her whole world,

20:53.377 --> 20:56.255
and there's a lot of pressure
that goes along with that.

20:57.130 --> 21:00.008
[Kato] Pick a resonator,
bring them and put them in the field.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.427
Put your hands on their shoulders

21:02.511 --> 21:05.764
and really feel it in your body
how that would feel,

21:05.847 --> 21:07.683
to be inhabiting your goal.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.934
Okay.

21:09.017 --> 21:14.147
So, before I was definitely
sort of, like, a love monster.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.148
[laughs]

21:15.232 --> 21:17.567
My relationships…

21:17.651 --> 21:22.072
I would, you know, start a relationship,
it would be really amazing,

21:22.155 --> 21:24.074
and I would just sort of get caught up.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.952
I could just have some weird affair,

21:27.035 --> 21:29.496
and then all of a sudden
I was, like, out… [snaps]

21:29.579 --> 21:31.123
…and they had no idea.

21:31.707 --> 21:37.504
I mean, I, like, loved
being in love or infatuation,

21:37.587 --> 21:42.592
or being, like, obsessed or like…
And I think it came from my childhood.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.014
I mean, I'm just sort of happy being here.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.767
I, kind of, don't need… I don't…

21:53.312 --> 21:55.814
I just don't need to interact
if I don't have to, you know?

21:55.897 --> 21:58.025
-But I can feel everything. You know?
-[Kato] Mm-hmm.

21:59.943 --> 22:02.321
So, in Sera's constellation,
it was fascinating,

22:02.404 --> 22:04.906
because I've actually
never had this situation

22:04.990 --> 22:10.245
where a couple were working and picked
the same resonator to be themselves.

22:10.746 --> 22:13.498
When I chose the woman to play me,

22:13.582 --> 22:18.253
I just, like, had this, like, feeling of,
like, wanting to go straight towards her.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.466
I didn't know why I did it. It was
just, like, this out-of-body experience.

22:22.549 --> 22:26.678
Would you be willing to, you know,
just take a look behind you

22:26.762 --> 22:30.182
and see what it feels like
to see the people that are there?

22:41.693 --> 22:45.113
And that changes your hands.
Now your hands are doing, like, fists.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.199
I'm wondering what everyone's thinking.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.700
Like, I feel very, like…

22:48.784 --> 22:51.953
Is everyone okay?
Like, they look so serious.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.832
Like, everyone has such different moods.
It's just a lot, you know?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.460
So, it does make me
a little bit more, like,

22:59.169 --> 23:00.629
unsteady.

23:00.712 --> 23:02.839
[Kato] And Soo Hyun was very different,

23:02.923 --> 23:05.884
did not have the same
physical reactions at all.

23:05.967 --> 23:10.639
There was this real
just wanting to stay in… in that state,

23:10.722 --> 23:13.266
and then you can't stay in that state.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.812
So… [laughs]
So, I put in her mother.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.272
I expected that
this was going to show us a lot.

23:19.356 --> 23:21.233
So, just think of that person.

23:23.735 --> 23:29.199
Sera picked Bryce to be her mother,
which was a very interesting choice.

23:29.282 --> 23:35.080
I think, less about gender, me personally,
than because she felt something in Bryce

23:35.163 --> 23:39.501
that reminded her not of her external
mother, but her internal mother.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.671
I think her mother is
a very active person in the world,

23:42.754 --> 23:45.173
but I think she picked the sadness.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.218
I think she felt Bryce carries
a sadness that we can see.

23:48.301 --> 23:50.095
So, I think she put Bryce in for that.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.098
As I stepped into the field

23:53.181 --> 23:55.892
and I was feeling Sera's hands on me,

23:55.976 --> 23:59.563
what I could see was
me going down this tunnel.

23:59.646 --> 24:03.692
It's a dark tunnel, and I can see
light at the end of the tunnel.

24:03.775 --> 24:08.947
And I want to stay focused
on that light and not look at her.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.201
So, it's almost like
there's a way out of here,

24:13.285 --> 24:15.704
and it's straight down the… Down.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.874
So, the light
is calling to you or the-- Uh-huh.

24:18.957 --> 24:19.875
-[Bryce] Yes.
-Uh-huh.

24:20.959 --> 24:21.960
Mm-hmm.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.715
How do you feel when she looks at you?
Do you feel anything?

24:28.675 --> 24:30.093
I feel a softening.

24:30.177 --> 24:33.305
[clears throat]
When she turned and looked at me,

24:33.388 --> 24:38.518
um, interestingly enough,
the sunlight really lit her face up,

24:38.602 --> 24:41.062
and it was that light calling to me.

24:41.146 --> 24:44.149
So, I felt lighter by looking at her.

24:44.232 --> 24:45.066
[Kato] Uh-huh.

24:45.150 --> 24:46.526
She's the light now.

24:47.819 --> 24:51.239
[Sera] When Bryce said,
"She's the light now,"

24:51.323 --> 24:56.620
it felt so familiar to the way that my mom
always made me the center of her world.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.790
So, we don't know exactly,
but this looks like it resonates for you

25:00.874 --> 25:03.376
[laughs] quite a bit as an image.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.294
-Yeah.
-Yep.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.464
Just seems like…
could be a little bit of a burden.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.674
It's a very nice thing to say,
so thank you.

25:09.758 --> 25:12.093
But it's just like,
uh, a lot of attention.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.261
[Kato] It's a lot.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.722
That's a big burden, to be the light.

25:15.805 --> 25:18.683
And it wasn't going to go
a whole lot further.

25:18.767 --> 25:20.936
So, it was time to put in Sera's dad.

25:21.019 --> 25:21.895
[sniffs]

25:24.898 --> 25:26.274
Do you feel that person?

25:26.358 --> 25:27.526
-[Soo Hyun] Yes.
-[Bryce] No.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.818
-No.
-No.

25:28.902 --> 25:29.778
[Kato] Uh-huh.

25:30.237 --> 25:31.947
And, Soo Hyun, do you?

25:32.822 --> 25:34.491
Yeah, I definitely feel her.

25:35.408 --> 25:39.079
But there's, like, an agitation to it,
so I'm, like, worried about her.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.205
[Kato] Uh-huh.

25:40.288 --> 25:43.375
I'm really interested
in any direction except for this one.

25:43.458 --> 25:46.378
[both laugh]

25:46.461 --> 25:48.838
-[Kato] Uh-huh.
-Really curious about what's behind me.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.966
[Kato] You're curious
about what's behind you. Uh-huh.

25:51.049 --> 25:52.801
[Jessica]
I could look at them for a long time.

25:54.052 --> 25:55.387
I don't feel very emotional.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.389
I feel like an observer or…

25:58.056 --> 26:01.893
In some ways, this is how so much
your dad is always looking in the affairs

26:01.977 --> 26:06.690
for other people, for other something.
Some something. Yeah.

26:07.274 --> 26:09.818
I don't…
I don't want her here, actually.

26:09.901 --> 26:10.735
[Kato] Yeah.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.989
It's almost like
she's invading this space.

26:14.072 --> 26:18.910
I was just beginning to enjoy her company,

26:18.994 --> 26:21.204
and then this one comes along
and steps in.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.707
And now, she's kind of
pushing me around, and…

26:24.708 --> 26:25.875
-It just…
-[Kato] Yeah.

26:25.959 --> 26:28.628
-You'd rather have it be just you two.
-Yeah.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.297
-[Kato] Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.800
Sera picked Jessica to be her dad,

26:33.883 --> 26:37.929
and she was not interested
in this mushy female business

26:38.013 --> 26:41.725
of family and having to,
you know, pay attention to all of that.

26:41.808 --> 26:45.812
She was interested in that row
of very interesting resonators behind her

26:45.895 --> 26:48.773
where maybe she could pick and choose
who to have an affair with

26:48.857 --> 26:51.693
and what would spark her interest,
you know?

26:52.402 --> 26:55.864
You know, I think there's
something fun and provocative,

26:55.947 --> 26:58.366
but I think underneath it is this kind of…

26:58.491 --> 26:59.993
[Jessica] I don't like being analyzed.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.786
-[Kato] You don't like…
-[laughter]

27:01.870 --> 27:03.622
-[Kato] I'm sure that's true.
-I really wanna…

27:03.705 --> 27:05.540
I like… I got room.

27:06.082 --> 27:07.542
-[Kato] Uh-huh.
-This territory.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.793
[Kato] Uh-huh.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.171
I feel a little like prowling.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.591
[Kato sighs] Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

27:15.717 --> 27:19.220
It became clear to Sera
that she can see herself

27:19.304 --> 27:21.431
where she has allegiance to her father,

27:21.514 --> 27:23.600
where she goes and does those affairs,

27:23.683 --> 27:25.977
not as something terrible,

27:26.061 --> 27:31.566
but as a misguided way of staying alive.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.988
So, I could feel that Sera had received

27:37.072 --> 27:39.366
what she needed to receive
around her father,

27:39.449 --> 27:41.326
but nothing more was happening there.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.745
So it was clear to me
we need to go back to the mom.

27:43.828 --> 27:47.165
We put in the grandmother and grandfather.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.460
And Angela, what's happening for you?

27:50.543 --> 27:53.296
-I feel overwhelmed by Bryce.
-You just feel overwhelmed.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.215
And I have this feeling like,

27:56.758 --> 27:59.761
why does anybody become a family?

27:59.844 --> 28:03.515
Like, it's something like that.
Like, it's just too hard.

28:03.598 --> 28:04.474
[Kato] Yeah.

28:05.308 --> 28:08.812
[Bryce] I feel like she's,
uh, mourning something.

28:08.895 --> 28:11.356
Yeah, she's in a state of mourning.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.942
Grieve… She's grieving something.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.486
-Yeah.
-[Bryce] And…

28:17.070 --> 28:18.655
I feel sorry for her.

28:23.785 --> 28:27.330
[Kato] Bryce, would you be willing
to try sitting down in front of them

28:27.414 --> 28:28.790
and see how it feels?

28:29.833 --> 28:32.502
Putting Bryce in
the appropriate position as a child

28:32.585 --> 28:38.591
to his mother's need
for him to carry her suffering.

28:40.885 --> 28:44.139
Watching her grieve from here is…

28:45.265 --> 28:46.683
It's twice as hard.

28:47.308 --> 28:51.563
It's harder for me too.
I now feel somewhat, like, nauseous.

28:51.646 --> 28:56.109
Before, it was just lamenting,
but now it's, like, worse.

28:57.485 --> 29:01.614
[Bryce] I'm just burdened by her grief.

29:02.365 --> 29:04.868
I just wanna pour all this into you.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.869
[Kato chuckles] Ah.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.164
I want to pour all this into you and I…

29:09.956 --> 29:12.834
I feel like you… [sighs]
You are helping me.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.920
Like, I could just
keep pouring it into you.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.673
[Sera] When I saw Angela,

29:18.757 --> 29:23.720
seeing the amount of grief
that she inflicted on my mom,

29:23.803 --> 29:25.847
just really… It was very eye-opening.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.682
[exhales]

29:29.100 --> 29:31.686
[Angela] I want you to carry my grief.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.188
I want you to…

29:35.106 --> 29:36.816
I don't wanna ruin your life with it,

29:36.900 --> 29:40.236
but, like, maybe you can do
something with it better than I could.

29:41.571 --> 29:44.115
[sighs] It feels better to give it to you.

29:44.199 --> 29:45.950
[exhales]

29:46.993 --> 29:47.994
Bryce?

29:48.661 --> 29:49.913
[Bryce] My body's trembling.

29:49.996 --> 29:50.997
Yes.

29:52.248 --> 29:54.292
It's literally trembling.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.293
Yes.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.630
Yes. Yes. Yes.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.131
[exhales]

30:00.215 --> 30:04.260
[Kato] I will often give the actual person
something very heavy to carry.

30:04.344 --> 30:07.597
It helps the nervous system to know
this is really what you're doing.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.641
So I gave that to Bryce, and it was like,

30:09.724 --> 30:11.768
"Oh my God. This burden of grief."

30:12.852 --> 30:17.357
And as soon as I did that, you'll notice,
then she could really just push.

30:17.440 --> 30:18.983
She was, like, all over the…

30:19.067 --> 30:22.946
Just pouring
the grief out on him for him to carry.

30:23.029 --> 30:26.950
Well, that grief has been
channeling through to Sera her whole life.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.078
[Camilo] Yeah. I feel like
saying that too right now.

30:30.161 --> 30:33.706
I feel like he shouldn't
be listening to this, actually.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.750
This is toxic right here, for me.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.628
And I feel like
I'm almost getting a massage now.

30:38.711 --> 30:42.131
You don't need to carry anything from her.
You don't need to carry that bag.

30:42.215 --> 30:46.052
I even feel like carrying the bag for you,
but I know that would be bad too.

30:47.554 --> 30:48.513
[Kato] Yes.

30:48.596 --> 30:50.098
Put it down. Put it down.

30:50.849 --> 30:54.769
[Bryce] I don't know how to put it down.
That's the problem. It was put on me.

30:56.187 --> 30:57.188
[Kato] Yes.

30:57.272 --> 31:01.234
[exhaling dramatically]

31:01.317 --> 31:05.655
[Kato] Yeah, and she's really powerful,
this one that put it on you. Yeah?

31:05.738 --> 31:06.948
Ah!

31:07.031 --> 31:09.576
[Kato] Yeah. Yeah.

31:10.285 --> 31:14.080
So, just feel what you're feeling
in your body, Bryce. Stay with it.

31:16.749 --> 31:19.878
-I want to stand up with this weight.
-[Kato] Go. Go. Go.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.881
[Angela exhales rapidly]

31:27.260 --> 31:30.305
[sighs] There's no way to… Me…

31:30.388 --> 31:33.057
There's no way for me
to sling this on her.

31:35.560 --> 31:40.773
So, say to her, "Mom. I'm giving you
your grief back. I'm putting it on you."

31:42.859 --> 31:44.694
I'm giving you your grief back.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.906
This is not for me to carry.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.245
And you have to take this from me.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.291
[exhales]

31:58.374 --> 31:59.751
[Bryce] It's getting heavier.

32:02.879 --> 32:04.589
I can't stand here forever.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.722
I was willing to kill you…

32:15.266 --> 32:16.684
to save myself.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.604
But I didn't want to kill you.

32:20.605 --> 32:23.107
But once I could get it off me,

32:23.191 --> 32:26.194
I just felt like
I couldn't stop getting it off.

32:28.821 --> 32:31.783
And I…And I am real…
I am sorry for that.

32:33.576 --> 32:36.996
I want to jet out of here now
and I want to go--

32:37.080 --> 32:38.873
[Kato] So, go where you want.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.501
Let's see how it feels
to go where you want to go.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.004
[Kato] Ha!

32:45.088 --> 32:46.297
[Sera chuckles]

32:47.048 --> 32:50.301
She's been carrying that grief
for her mother,

32:50.385 --> 32:52.595
because she's the light
at the end of the tunnel.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.889
Thank you. [laughs]

32:55.765 --> 33:00.520
My grandma, who was, like,
constantly contemplating suicide,

33:00.603 --> 33:04.023
my mom said that she would come in
and she was trying to kill herself.

33:04.774 --> 33:06.985
You know, 'cause it was
just that sort of, like, dark,

33:07.068 --> 33:09.487
and my mom just, like,
carried that heaviness.

33:09.570 --> 33:12.991
And my mom actually
hasn't even told me how dark it is.

33:13.074 --> 33:16.077
Recently, I'm kind of starting
to put some pieces together

33:16.160 --> 33:19.163
of just how hard it was
for my mom as a child.

33:19.247 --> 33:20.832
But because I'm an only child,

33:20.915 --> 33:25.128
the focus was more on me
and not her past. And, um…

33:25.211 --> 33:27.213
[Kato] And not just
because you're an only child,

33:27.296 --> 33:29.215
because you're the light
at the end of the tunnel.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.551
-[laughter]
-Yeah. Totally.

33:32.760 --> 33:37.265
She doesn't want to follow
the pattern she's had in her life

33:37.348 --> 33:41.769
of exiting relationships
by having an affair and going.

33:41.853 --> 33:44.480
The focus that her mother has had on her

33:44.564 --> 33:47.984
her whole life, where she's
going to be, sort of, the answer…

33:48.067 --> 33:51.237
Because it's the only place
her mother could make okayness

33:51.320 --> 33:53.656
in a difficult marriage,
in a difficult life.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.158
And it was a huge burden.

33:55.241 --> 33:59.912
So, she gives herself away to people,
and then she's trapped just like her dad.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.497
And then she has to leave.

34:01.581 --> 34:05.793
That was the key
to that piece of trauma in Sera's family

34:05.877 --> 34:08.880
that came through Sera's grandmother,
to Sera's mother, to Sera,

34:09.797 --> 34:12.842
this enormous grief that nobody wanted

34:12.925 --> 34:16.888
that had to be accepted by
the person who had it in the first place.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.475
What is your advice for people?

34:20.558 --> 34:25.980
If this feels resonant, understanding
that they want to explore or heal,

34:26.064 --> 34:29.025
or, you know,
take their relationship to the next level?

34:29.108 --> 34:31.194
So, for a relationship to work,

34:31.277 --> 34:33.988
a solid base is super important,

34:34.072 --> 34:37.116
and it's starting
early in the relationship.

34:37.200 --> 34:42.413
On one end,
you need to work on your own patterns.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.834
Then you have to learn how to catch
that pattern with the other person.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.338
So, it takes quite a bit of work
for the sake of the relationship.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.174
I think it's the internal experience

34:53.257 --> 34:59.180
and really knowing yourself and knowing
who you are and what's true for you and…

34:59.263 --> 35:02.183
This is something
that will not only serve you,

35:02.266 --> 35:05.895
but your partner, your children,
your community, your family.

35:07.563 --> 35:13.319
I think a lot of couples will look
for therapy and will look for ways to heal

35:13.402 --> 35:16.322
a lot of times in the relationship
when it's too late.

35:16.405 --> 35:18.491
You know, it's towards the end.

35:18.574 --> 35:22.537
And family, and family history
is such a huge part of who we are,

35:22.620 --> 35:27.083
so if you can really connect with it
and then share that with your partner

35:27.166 --> 35:29.669
and then you can have
this experience together, I feel like…

35:29.752 --> 35:33.965
Because when you're in a couple,
you're essentially making a new family,

35:34.048 --> 35:36.300
so you don't want
to just, like, repeat the past.

35:36.384 --> 35:39.554
You want to make a new future
and a new family with them.

35:39.637 --> 35:42.223
Thank the past, but just move forward.

35:42.306 --> 35:44.976
-Totally.
-So, that's what feels really special.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.854
When you can both be "who I am,"

35:47.937 --> 35:52.233
then you can have a very long time
of constant discovery.

35:52.316 --> 35:54.777
It's only, like,
when you give yourselves away…

35:54.861 --> 35:57.822
-Yeah.
-…that that stops being able to happen.

35:57.905 --> 36:02.702
But if you stay, you're here, you're here
and we love, you can go on forever.

36:02.785 --> 36:03.911
-All right.
-[Sera] Thank you.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.621
-Yeah.
-[Dash] Thank you so much.

36:05.746 --> 36:08.958
[Sera] It's been four months
since we did the constellation.

36:09.041 --> 36:12.378
The experience is now
part of our foundation as a couple.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.176
The greatest sense of relief

36:18.259 --> 36:24.348
is being able to let go of things
that I thought were my issues.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.601
Like, these were things
that were handed down

36:26.684 --> 36:28.269
that at one point served a purpose,

36:29.103 --> 36:31.898
and no longer serve me
as a person in the world.

36:34.984 --> 36:38.279
[upbeat vocal music playing]
