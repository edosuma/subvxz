00:05.040 --> 00:07.120
I've seen comedy shows.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.480
That's the problem.

00:08.560 --> 00:11.560
If I'd never seen them in my life,
I just wouldn't know anything.

00:11.840 --> 00:13.080
That would be a lot better.

00:13.160 --> 00:16.560
Usually, people do their
first comedy shows at open mics.

00:16.640 --> 00:19.520
But now I'm saying my
whole skit to a full house!

00:19.600 --> 00:21.800
And that's scary shit, man!

01:00.400 --> 01:04.160
Hi! I'm your host and part-time
Instagram stalker, Sapan Verma.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.040
And this is One Mic Stand.

01:06.240 --> 01:10.160
On today's episode, we have two
charismatic and unconventional women,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.440
who like living life on their own terms.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.160
Celebrity guest Sunny Leone.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.560
An actor, a businesswoman,
and a mother of three kids.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.560
And guiding her in her stand-up journey,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.880
we have an almost civilized
stand-up comedian,

01:22.120 --> 01:25.840
a Comicstaan judge
and mother of three dogs: Neeti Palta.

01:26.560 --> 01:30.600
As women, we are not so worried whether
our flight will land safely or not.

01:30.760 --> 01:33.200
Bigger concern:
Who's going to come sit next to me?

01:34.160 --> 01:35.480
Am I right, ladies?

01:35.680 --> 01:37.320
I get judgmental!
I'm looking at people.

01:37.400 --> 01:40.600
Oh! Tall fellow!
He will take up all my legroom.

01:41.360 --> 01:44.960
Oh! Fat fellow. He will overflow
over the armrest into my chair.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.800
I think the only co-passenger
we want at that time is

01:48.880 --> 01:50.360
Thakur from <i>Sholay.</i>

01:53.120 --> 01:54.480
And guys, don't do this, please.

01:54.560 --> 01:55.520
What is it with you people?

01:55.600 --> 01:57.440
You have no sense of body space.

01:57.520 --> 01:58.320
None.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.680
I'm just putting my
luggage in the overhead bin

02:00.760 --> 02:02.200
and you are standing
behind so close to me.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.720
Dude, I really get to know

02:04.800 --> 02:06.760
whether the person behind
is <i>bhaiya</i> or <i>bhaijaan.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:15.440
I loved how that went.

02:18.160 --> 02:20.520
I ordered my plate of non-veg, right?

02:20.600 --> 02:21.400
This-- On the flight.

02:21.440 --> 02:22.600
And this lady freaks out!

02:22.880 --> 02:26.600
"I don't believe in putting
dead meat in my mouth!"

02:33.160 --> 02:35.040
I'm keeping it clean, guys!

02:36.000 --> 02:36.840
Have you noticed?

02:36.880 --> 02:39.760
The call of your bladder
is directly proportional to…

02:40.000 --> 02:43.000
"The seat belt signs have been turned on."

02:44.000 --> 02:46.240
So, I'm like, okay, man.
Let me just get out and use the loo.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.240
But this guy in the
aisle seat was fast asleep.

02:49.320 --> 02:50.680
I could do nothing to shake him.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.560
So, I'm like, okay, man.

02:51.640 --> 02:53.560
Never mind.
Let me just jump across, okay?

02:53.760 --> 02:56.120
I swear to you guys,
I put one foot in the middle.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.560
I put one foot across him in the aisle.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.880
At this point, he woke up!

03:04.680 --> 03:06.720
His expression actually went from…

03:08.000 --> 03:08.800
to…

03:10.960 --> 03:12.640
"Upgrade within the budget?!"

03:14.400 --> 03:17.360
And before I sign off, guys,
I saw you locked down a bit.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.400
I have nothing against men, seriously.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.560
I love North Indian men.

03:23.480 --> 03:26.080
Don't laugh, seriously,
they are the easiest to please.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.040
You'll be walking on the road,
you brush up against them a little bit,

03:29.120 --> 03:30.600
they'll go, "That was fun!"

03:34.880 --> 03:37.200
Guys, do you agree that
we belong to a society

03:37.280 --> 03:40.600
that believes in telling its women
what to do to stay safe,

03:40.680 --> 03:42.680
rather than telling its men
what not to do?

03:42.960 --> 03:44.000
-Yeah.
-Yes.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.280
I'm not making this up.

03:45.360 --> 03:48.920
There is actually an invention
out there called, "The Electric Bra".

03:50.480 --> 03:53.960
So, if a potential molester comes at you,
he gets an electric current.

03:55.040 --> 03:56.960
I'm thinking, "This is great, brother!"

03:57.040 --> 03:58.360
Why don't you reverse it?

03:59.040 --> 04:01.960
Why don't you create
an electric underwear instead?

04:02.480 --> 04:04.640
So, the next time the
bugger is coming at you,

04:04.720 --> 04:07.000
the AC/DC gets the BC!

04:08.960 --> 04:10.120
Thank you so much, guys!

04:10.200 --> 04:12.560
I'm Neeti Palta. You've been fabulous!

04:22.360 --> 04:24.560
I came to you last year
when we were

04:24.640 --> 04:26.120
-shooting season one of this show.
-Yeah.

04:26.200 --> 04:27.120
And you didn't do it.

04:27.480 --> 04:29.240
And now here you are on season two.

04:29.360 --> 04:30.240
What changed?

04:30.360 --> 04:32.520
Well, you know, a lot changes in a year.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.920
-People grow.
-Right.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.080
Things happen.

04:35.240 --> 04:36.080
I also think,

04:36.200 --> 04:38.440
-I'm in a different mind frame now.
-Right.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.920
Or maybe I just don't give a shit.

04:41.080 --> 04:44.600
I give less of a shit
now than I did last year.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.920
Maybe you didn't have
a good enough mentor last year.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.440
-Fine, Neeti…
-Yeah, you came along, actually.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.040
-You came along.
-Thank you very much!

04:52.120 --> 04:53.440
Fine, so you are the…
You are the lucky charm.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.760
-Comedy gold comes from real-life stories.
-Yeah.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.120
And I am sure you have
like a trillion of them.

04:59.240 --> 05:02.800
So, I actually just wanted to find out
things that you want to talk about

05:02.880 --> 05:04.720
that we could weave into
your set and stuff.

05:04.920 --> 05:06.920
Okay. I've seen a lot of comedy.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.080
-You have?
-And-- Yeah.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.560
-Where?
-In the US.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.920
I dated a comedian.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.440
But it was for like a hot second.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.320
-It wasn't for a very long time.
-Who was it?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.600
His name is Russell.

05:16.440 --> 05:17.560
Russell Peters.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.120
-Yeah.
-You dated Russell Peters?

05:20.240 --> 05:21.480
Yeah, but it was like--

05:21.560 --> 05:23.440
You know, I messed--
We messed it up!

05:23.600 --> 05:25.760
I mean, we were friends for years.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.360
Why the hell would we start dating?

05:28.520 --> 05:31.480
It was the worst thing ever that
we could have ever done

05:31.560 --> 05:32.840
-and I'm still mad
-Shit!

05:33.000 --> 05:36.280
to this day, because we
would be such good friends still.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.680
Are you in any of his jokes?

05:37.800 --> 05:40.320
I have heard that I am in a
couple of his jokes.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.680
Man, now I have to see
all his videos all over again.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.800
Okay, I have been thinking about
a lot of different ways

05:45.920 --> 05:48.200
-this, you know, whole thing can go.
-Okay.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.960
And one of the things, if I can
visually give them something…

05:52.040 --> 05:53.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.760
Like, one of the things
when I was growing up

05:55.960 --> 05:57.600
I was like, unibrow.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.120
Extremely hairy.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.440
Now I've lasered everything off.
There's no hair left.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.000
-It's only here and my eyebrows.
-Punjabi stereotypes!

06:03.080 --> 06:05.400
-The Punjabiness is coming out.
-Punjabi stereotypes!

06:05.480 --> 06:09.120
Right!
So, typical Punjabi stereotype.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.560
And-- Do you guys know who Chewbacca is?

06:11.640 --> 06:12.480
-Yes.
-Of course!

06:12.560 --> 06:14.440
I was like Chewbacca with two pigtails.

06:15.080 --> 06:15.960
Okay!

06:16.280 --> 06:18.720
I love it when you break
into a little Punjabi or Hindi.

06:18.800 --> 06:19.840
Can you break into Punjabi?

06:19.920 --> 06:21.560
[In Punjabi] What the hell?

06:21.640 --> 06:23.880
-That's not a line, Sunny!
-Oh! It's not?

06:24.200 --> 06:25.360
-Okay.
-That's great!

06:25.440 --> 06:27.080
[In Punjabi] What the pant-shirt!

06:27.400 --> 06:28.720
[In Punjabi] Your mother's lentils!

06:28.920 --> 06:30.240
Is this all you know in Punjabi?

06:30.320 --> 06:31.720
Oh! <i>Aaloo paratha!</i>

06:33.960 --> 06:35.000
Stand-up is payback.

06:35.160 --> 06:37.280
We'll just be unleashing
you on stage, I think.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.840
-This is going to be so much fun.
-Yeah.

06:38.920 --> 06:39.720
I know!

06:39.800 --> 06:41.560
Just go to town
with everything that has happened.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.240
Yeah, use all your emotions, you know.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.880
The audience will connect like that.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.200
You win them over through sheer truth.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.440
-Cheers! Cheers!
-Cheers!

06:48.520 --> 06:49.840
-Okay, cheers!
-I've already sipped.

06:49.920 --> 06:51.560
-Sorry, I started because-- Okay.
-Cheers!

06:52.200 --> 06:55.240
How's it like having
Daniel as your manager?

06:55.320 --> 06:57.840
It's great!
We have everything separated into two.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.640
I'm the creatives, he's business.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.480
He would never get in the middle of

07:01.640 --> 07:06.200
how this is all gonna
end up being on screen.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.720
He did the back-end of it.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.680
-Right.
-Okay.

07:09.800 --> 07:10.800
That's not a joke!

07:11.760 --> 07:12.600
I'm getting slower.

07:12.680 --> 07:15.760
-Get your mind out of the gutter!
-You said it, I didn't say it.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.160
-Look at your face!
-I didn't even realize.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.120
But because--
This is so cool that you can do this.

07:19.520 --> 07:20.360
Yeah.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.840
It's a very different side of
you that people have not seen before.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.520
…So, I feel like that'll
also be interesting

07:24.600 --> 07:26.400
cause they'll be like,
"Oh! One, she's obviously funny!

07:26.720 --> 07:30.400
And two, she's being so open and she's
exposing all the truths about her

07:30.480 --> 07:31.880
that people say this, or say that."

07:31.960 --> 07:34.640
If you put a set together
with just a bunch of jokes,

07:34.800 --> 07:36.040
that's the three-second laughs.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.960
-But in your case, you can actually
-Story.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.560
take them through a story.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.960
You're making them travel
through your life story.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.520
So, that's one way to remember
the show flow for starters.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.320
-That's great!
-And it's not just a collection of jokes.

07:47.440 --> 07:50.280
Even if you have silences where
they're listening to the life story,

07:50.360 --> 07:51.200
-Yeah.
-that's what you want.

07:51.280 --> 07:53.520
Because then they laugh
harder at the punchline.

07:53.600 --> 07:54.400
Yeah.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.440
So, I think you're
actually going to be fine!

07:56.600 --> 07:58.440
Before we wrap up,
we want to do one more thing with you.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.240
We do one thing called
role reversal, where--

08:00.320 --> 08:01.680
Since we're teaching
you how to do stand-up,

08:01.840 --> 08:03.040
you should teach us something as well.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.320
And you already look too excited!

08:04.400 --> 08:05.720
This is gonna be amazing!

08:05.800 --> 08:09.520
Cause I'm gonna make you guys do
something that you've never done before.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.320
Or I'm gonna guess
you've never done before.

08:11.400 --> 08:12.840
Or maybe you have done it before,

08:12.920 --> 08:14.680
except nobody knows
you've done it before.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.600
Okay!

08:15.680 --> 08:18.320
Because you do it in the
privacy of your own home, maybe…

08:18.400 --> 08:20.360
Okay, this sounds very dubious now.
Where are we going?

08:20.440 --> 08:21.360
We're gonna go outside.

08:21.640 --> 08:22.680
-Okay, let's do it!
-Okay.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.160
I have set everything up for you
and ta-da!

08:28.400 --> 08:29.560
Come closer.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.040
Come closer.

08:31.200 --> 08:34.440
You know, since I'm
gonna be so uncomfortable

08:34.800 --> 08:36.520
doing stand-up for the first time,

08:36.720 --> 08:39.120
you know, I thought,
payback's a bitch!

08:39.520 --> 08:42.720
So, I've brought out the pole!

08:43.520 --> 08:45.320
So, you can walk around the pole.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.440
That's easy!

08:46.600 --> 08:48.080
Okay?
You can do a dip.

08:48.600 --> 08:49.440
Okay.

08:49.520 --> 08:50.840
Or you can go like this.

08:51.840 --> 08:52.880
You can, like, shimmy down!

08:53.080 --> 08:54.280
-I can do that.
-Okay? Shimmy shimmy.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.640
But you've to put your butt out.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.120
This is not sexy.

08:57.480 --> 08:58.640
This is sexier.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.000
And if you feel like
you're really up to it,

09:01.080 --> 09:03.640
you can hold
on to it and go like this.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.120
-Oh!
-Okay.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.640
-So, who's going first?
-I volunteer Sapan.

09:08.760 --> 09:11.160
-First, I'll start with the basics, okay?
-Ready, set, go.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.480
Shimmy! Alright!

09:19.760 --> 09:21.000
I did it! Did it!

09:21.120 --> 09:22.000
-Come on!
-Alright.

09:22.080 --> 09:22.880
Do it.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.480
This is not Kabaddi, Neeti.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.480
-What the hell--
-Okay, yeah.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.240
I'll just stick to the…

09:31.480 --> 09:33.520
-Now you're too cute!
-I'm too cute?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.080
Sexy, Neeti, sexy!

09:36.640 --> 09:38.320
-She can do it. Not bad.
-Did that work?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.360
You guys did a good job!

09:40.520 --> 09:42.640
Okay!
Now that we're done with this,

09:42.760 --> 09:45.280
you have a show to do,
which is this weekend.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.600
Oh, my gosh!

09:46.640 --> 09:47.520
It'll be fun!

09:47.600 --> 09:48.440
-They'll love you!
-Okay

09:48.520 --> 09:50.080
-That makes me feel better.
-Yeah!

09:50.160 --> 09:51.040
-I'm just kidding.
-Okay.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.520
We'll see you on the stand-up day.

10:02.600 --> 10:03.520
-Hi!
-Hi!

10:03.720 --> 10:04.640
How are you doing?

10:05.120 --> 10:06.200
What's the biggest worry right now?

10:06.280 --> 10:09.280
Two days is not enough to
prepare for something like this.

10:09.360 --> 10:10.480
-This is insane!
-Yeah, fair enough!

10:10.520 --> 10:11.640
But you know, the best part is,

10:11.720 --> 10:13.600
you're telling those
stories in your own words.

10:13.640 --> 10:16.880
I know, but the parts that
are funny are the punchlines.

10:16.960 --> 10:19.160
So, if you don't even remember that,

10:19.320 --> 10:21.120
you can tell the story all day long,

10:21.200 --> 10:23.400
but the story is not
funny without the punchlines!

10:23.520 --> 10:24.360
This is--

10:24.440 --> 10:25.760
I don't know why I said yes.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.520
I like you two!
I think you both are so nice!

10:28.760 --> 10:30.120
But this is a mistake.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.720
Look at this, it's going to be full.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.200
There will be people sitting 180 degrees.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.520
You can look there, there, there.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.840
Or you can easily walk up to here.
No problem.

10:41.880 --> 10:43.520
See, this is more stand-upy.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.240
But if you think you are going to
use your hands more--

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
I like to do this.

10:46.400 --> 10:47.480
-So, we'll do that.
-You know.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.760
I am Indian,
I do talk with my hands

10:49.880 --> 10:51.520
Where am I going to put the mic,
when I am like…

10:53.120 --> 10:53.960
Yeah.

10:54.760 --> 10:58.720
I am from Canada
and my parents used to speak in Punjabi.

10:58.840 --> 10:59.880
Damn you!

11:03.760 --> 11:04.800
Babydoll.

11:06.200 --> 11:07.920
-When the interview happened, it was here.
-Yeah.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.560
Happiness.
Now, like an hour ago, it was like this.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.120
Now, somewhere here.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.360
Because of the soundcheck and we've,
like, kind of reassured her it'll be good.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.400
I want to see after the show,
does it go here, here?

11:17.480 --> 11:18.360
What happens?

11:18.440 --> 11:20.080
-Yeah, it won't break…
-You can break it.

11:21.720 --> 11:24.120
To avoid criticism, avoid trying.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.640
Alright! Goodbye!

11:26.280 --> 11:29.040
See you later. I'll just leave now.

11:30.040 --> 11:33.040
I mean, who wants
to stay here and do this?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.480
This is like a sign from God, everyone!

11:36.840 --> 11:38.440
Just cancel, now!

11:42.120 --> 11:43.840
I usually like challenges.

11:44.160 --> 11:46.880
I think that challenges
and stepping out of your comfort zone

11:46.960 --> 11:49.080
are great for growing.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.960
I like to feel confident
when I'm going up on stage.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.920
And I don't feel confident,
so that's my problem.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
We used to retake
if I messed something up.

11:59.400 --> 12:00.600
There's no retake here.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.640
It's just, "Go!"

12:01.720 --> 12:02.800
It's go time!

12:03.840 --> 12:06.720
The one thing that I just can't tolerate
when I go to watch movies

12:06.800 --> 12:08.440
is the anti-smoking ads.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.200
I'm tired of that shit, dude!

12:11.320 --> 12:13.160
It's annoying, right?
Because you go with your family,

12:13.240 --> 12:15.360
you've taken food,
you go inside, settle down.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.360
You're about to put
that samosa into your mouth.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.800
And just then, they go,

12:19.920 --> 12:22.040
"Look at these rotten
lungs being squeezed."

12:23.200 --> 12:24.160
I'm like, why?

12:24.320 --> 12:25.840
I've never smoked anyway.

12:26.080 --> 12:28.280
After watching this ad,
I've stopped drinking Pepsi as well.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.000
And my problem is,
half of us don't even smoke.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.480
Why are we being subjected to this?

12:33.880 --> 12:34.840
I have a new idea.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.320
You know how airlines
board people sequentially?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.560
Like, "Senior citizens will board first,
wheelchair-bound will board first."

12:39.880 --> 12:42.600
Like that, multiplexes
should board, "Only smokers inside."

12:44.480 --> 12:46.240
Then show these ads for two hours.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.400
Give them counseling.

12:49.240 --> 12:51.560
Blow smoke rings on their faces.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.080
Do all that.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.440
Call their parents…

12:57.520 --> 12:59.680
"Aunty, look at your
idiot son, he's smoking!"

13:00.600 --> 13:02.000
Just ruin their lives!

13:02.720 --> 13:03.880
Then send us inside.

13:04.920 --> 13:06.320
And the problem is,
now we all know.

13:06.400 --> 13:08.720
We all know that first fifteen minutes,
they will play these ads.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.440
So, nobody enters the theater on time.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.320
I was outside the theater.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.320
Two guys were like, "Bro, they must
be showing the anti-smoking ad."

13:14.400 --> 13:16.000
"Let's have another
smoke before we go in."

13:18.720 --> 13:19.720
What's the point?

13:21.520 --> 13:24.400
Also, I feel like we need to
change the word <i>"Dhoomrapaan"</i>.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.040
It sounds too cool…

13:28.080 --> 13:30.680
for something that is supposed
to be injurious to health.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.040
Like, <i>dhoomrapaan</i>
doesn't sound like a threat.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.560
It sounds like a skill that you have!

13:35.400 --> 13:38.520
"My daughter can perform Bharatanatyam,
Kuchipudi and Dhoomrapaan!"

13:42.080 --> 13:43.480
That's what that sounds like.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.160
My favorite,
my favorite anti-smoking ad though,

13:46.560 --> 13:48.280
is this new one featuring Akshay Kumar.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.640
Have you guys seen the ad?

13:51.720 --> 13:52.560
It's amazing!

13:52.640 --> 13:54.920
Akshay Kumar comes on a bicycle,
tells a guy, "Stop smoking

13:55.040 --> 13:56.720
and buy a sanitary pad instead."

13:57.240 --> 14:00.040
Akshay Kumar promoted three
social causes in a single ad.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.920
No smoking, sanitary pads, and cycling!

14:04.560 --> 14:06.280
And my favorite is
the tagline of the ad is,

14:06.440 --> 14:08.800
"Smoking does not make you a hero,
buying this does."

14:09.440 --> 14:12.400
Basically, he's saying, instead of
buying cigarettes, buy a sanitary pad.

14:12.800 --> 14:14.120
Which is great advice…

14:14.800 --> 14:17.760
if you or someone you
know is on their period.

14:19.520 --> 14:20.440
Otherwise…

14:22.960 --> 14:24.080
if you're just a guy…

14:25.560 --> 14:27.080
who is stressed at work,

14:28.960 --> 14:30.000
you can't go out and be like,

14:30.080 --> 14:31.800
"Dude! Boss has given me too much work!"

14:32.840 --> 14:34.280
"Hey, give me a pack of Stayfree."

14:35.520 --> 14:36.480
Can't do that!

14:39.160 --> 14:40.040
Alright.

14:40.720 --> 14:41.560
Ladies and gents.

14:41.640 --> 14:44.040
Are you guys ready for your
final act of the evening, yes?

14:45.960 --> 14:48.640
You guys know the format of the show.
This is One Mic Stand.

14:48.720 --> 14:51.760
We have a celebrity coming and performing
stand-up for the first time ever.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.400
She is nervous, she is petrified.

14:53.480 --> 14:54.760
She's been working really hard at it.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.640
So, you guys have to be
extra supportive and loud.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.800
Can we do that tonight, yes?

14:57.920 --> 14:58.920
-Yes!
-Yes!

14:59.000 --> 14:59.800
Awesome.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.600
So, I thought of multiple
ways of introducing her.

15:01.680 --> 15:03.160
But I just don't know
how to introduce her.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.080
She's amazing!

15:04.160 --> 15:06.120
And this is so unexpected
and I'm so excited!

15:06.200 --> 15:07.040
So, ladies and gents,

15:07.200 --> 15:09.480
please put your hands together
and please welcome to the stage,

15:09.600 --> 15:13.440
the very funny Sunny Leone!

15:22.920 --> 15:23.760
Wow!

15:26.560 --> 15:28.080
Yeah, I'm here.

15:29.120 --> 15:32.040
I, never in my life,
thought I'd be doing this, by the way.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.920
So, my name is Sunny Leone.

15:35.360 --> 15:40.400
And, you all know me for
something I've done in my past.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
That you've all judged me for,

15:45.040 --> 15:47.880
and that I might be a little ashamed of.

15:48.680 --> 15:49.840
"Mastizaade."

15:54.560 --> 15:57.640
So, I just want to
get this out of the way.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.920
Because I know what you all are thinking.

16:00.480 --> 16:04.000
Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex. Sex.

16:04.400 --> 16:05.320
Little guy!

16:11.320 --> 16:12.800
How did you get here?

16:17.680 --> 16:19.760
You know,
this is going to be the most action

16:19.880 --> 16:21.080
you're going to get in your life, buddy.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.760
I do have a husband.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.000
And I have to say that I'm pretty lucky.

16:29.360 --> 16:32.600
He's really nice and he's
a dream-come-true husband.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.320
So, ladies and gentlemen,
can we please give it up for Daniel Weber?

16:40.200 --> 16:41.920
The men here, probably…

16:42.120 --> 16:44.240
you know, you guys probably hate him.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.640
But your wife next to you
probably loves him!

16:51.400 --> 16:52.280
And you know,

16:52.400 --> 16:56.960
Daniel not only deals
with me and our crazy children,

16:57.560 --> 17:00.480
but he also deals with
every weirdo out there.

17:01.360 --> 17:05.000
I mean, on a daily basis,
you will not believe

17:05.160 --> 17:08.520
how many pictures of
naked men he gets all day!

17:10.240 --> 17:13.040
I mean, Daniel could
be India's leading urologist

17:13.080 --> 17:15.240
based on the amount
of dick pics he sees.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.640
It's the craziest thing!
You know what, screw it.

17:23.320 --> 17:26.240
The only way this is going to
make sense is if I paint you the picture.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.440
Alright?

17:27.520 --> 17:29.080
So, imagine this fan.

17:29.800 --> 17:34.560
He decides, "Screw it.
I am going to do this."

17:34.800 --> 17:38.520
Alright? He pulls his camera out.
He sets it down.

17:38.560 --> 17:41.520
He picks the best spot
with the best light, alright?

17:41.720 --> 17:43.800
And then he starts taking pictures.

17:48.320 --> 17:49.240
And then…

17:57.200 --> 17:58.760
The best part is the smile!

17:59.920 --> 18:03.640
And then he thinks, "You know what?
I'll just send this picture to Daniel.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.400
And he'll just pass it to Sunny!

18:09.400 --> 18:11.400
And she'll decide to have sex with me.

18:11.480 --> 18:13.760
Or maybe… just maybe…

18:14.160 --> 18:15.720
that might get me into porn."

18:16.720 --> 18:20.320
I mean, Daniel is so used to
getting dick pics in his e-mail

18:20.560 --> 18:23.560
that he opens his
G-mail in incognito mode.

18:31.080 --> 18:33.480
And porn, on a normal page.

18:36.240 --> 18:39.880
But really, guys, this is how people
think castings happen in adult films.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.640
There's just somebody
sitting around going,

18:43.320 --> 18:44.080
"Nope."

18:44.640 --> 18:45.640
"Too fat."

18:47.040 --> 18:47.960
"Nope."

18:49.040 --> 18:49.880
"Too short."

18:51.040 --> 18:51.800
"Nope."

18:52.160 --> 18:53.160
"Too dark."

18:54.160 --> 18:56.000
But really, that's not what happens.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.160
It's porn, not Bollywood!

19:04.080 --> 19:07.000
Bollywood and adult films
are very different.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.920
In adult films,
you know who's gonna screw you.

19:16.280 --> 19:19.040
I have the greatest fans!

19:19.400 --> 19:20.920
You guys…
Do I have any fans out here?

19:21.280 --> 19:22.400
Any? Couple?

19:23.680 --> 19:25.200
But I do. I have the greatest fans.

19:25.320 --> 19:26.320
-But some of them--
-I love you!

19:26.480 --> 19:27.560
I love you.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.520
Little guy, I love you!

19:36.160 --> 19:37.640
But some of these fans…

19:37.760 --> 19:39.200
they can be scary too!

19:39.640 --> 19:42.560
I mean, there was this one time
I was supposed to perform in Bangalore.

19:42.760 --> 19:46.560
But these protesters
threatened mass suicide

19:47.000 --> 19:49.800
because I was assaulting their culture!

19:50.400 --> 19:54.520
What would happen if this
guy called a suicide helpline?

19:55.440 --> 19:57.960
"Hello! Sir, I want to commit suicide."

19:58.440 --> 20:01.080
"Why, sir?
Why do you want to commit suicide?"

20:01.880 --> 20:05.280
"Sunny Leone is coming to perform,
so I'll kill myself!"

20:06.400 --> 20:07.240
Really?

20:07.320 --> 20:10.800
And in all this, I'm thinking,
"Am I such a bad dancer?"

20:18.080 --> 20:21.920
So, basically, I get a lot of
these extreme reactions from people.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.680
Either I have fans
who are die-hard fans.

20:24.800 --> 20:25.800
They love me.

20:26.560 --> 20:29.000
They're going to send me
nude pictures of themselves.

20:30.080 --> 20:32.880
Or they are threatening
to kill themselves.

20:33.480 --> 20:37.080
I mean, my fans take
"Do or Die" to the next level!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.160
But this fan really sticks out in my mind.

20:43.920 --> 20:47.480
She comes up to me with her baby,
and she goes,

20:48.280 --> 20:50.320
"Take a picture, she's your fan."

21:02.160 --> 21:04.000
I mean, fan from where?

21:05.800 --> 21:07.720
Does she not know who I am?

21:08.520 --> 21:11.880
I mean, all I want to do is,
tell this cute little baby is,

21:12.640 --> 21:14.560
"Watch Captain America…

21:15.760 --> 21:17.480
not Naughty America."

21:23.960 --> 21:25.760
You know, as an entertainer…

21:26.680 --> 21:29.040
we have to do so many
different interviews.

21:29.160 --> 21:32.200
But, you know,
some of them don't go as planned.

21:32.880 --> 21:37.800
Talking to them feels more like
a guilt trip than an actual interview.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.520
They go,
"Do you regret, you know… that?"

21:42.560 --> 21:43.480
I'm like, "What?"

21:43.960 --> 21:45.680
"Eating <i>chhole</i> before a flight?"

21:46.400 --> 21:47.200
"Yes!"

21:49.320 --> 21:51.200
"No, no, no, no. The P-word."

21:51.280 --> 21:52.080
"Panda?"

21:53.240 --> 21:54.800
"No, the P-word,

21:55.000 --> 21:59.160
which is morally corrupt and
you have to compromise all your values."

22:01.720 --> 22:02.800
Politics!

22:09.920 --> 22:12.000
You know, these guys, they ask me,

22:12.080 --> 22:15.280
"If there was one thing
you could change in your life,

22:15.360 --> 22:16.800
what would it be from your past?"

22:17.200 --> 22:18.840
And I'm like, to be honest,

22:19.360 --> 22:22.880
I would go back in my past
and not come for this interview.

22:23.520 --> 22:24.400
So…

22:24.960 --> 22:25.800
you know…

22:29.640 --> 22:33.600
Some of these guys,
they come up with the craziest headlines!

22:33.760 --> 22:37.800
I mean, they twist and turn
around all the things that I say.

22:37.880 --> 22:40.960
And they come up with
these very creative headlines.

22:41.080 --> 22:42.840
So, this one guy
comes up to me and he goes,

22:43.160 --> 22:44.840
"Sunny, Sunny, Sunny…

22:47.040 --> 22:49.760
what's 68 plus 1?"

22:53.360 --> 22:54.680
So, the headline reads,

22:54.800 --> 22:58.960
"Sunny Leone talking about
69 will blow your mind!"

23:00.800 --> 23:03.360
Or this other guy.
He's like, "Sunny, Sunny!

23:04.400 --> 23:06.400
How do fairy tales end?"

23:07.280 --> 23:09.720
"Sunny Leone wants happy ending!"

23:11.600 --> 23:14.200
It's… I know! So creative, right?

23:17.800 --> 23:20.800
So, talking about these shady people,

23:21.400 --> 23:25.440
I had this one famous
nightmare interview with a journalist.

23:26.080 --> 23:27.040
Super-annoying!

23:27.120 --> 23:30.080
Kept asking me questions,
then answering them himself.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.000
He mentions after the interview that

23:36.120 --> 23:38.880
he won't watch my movies
because he has kids at home.

23:39.560 --> 23:40.960
Forget my videos,

23:41.320 --> 23:45.040
you should be worried about
your kids watching your videos!

23:51.840 --> 23:55.640
How is it that
I am the reason for all problems?

23:55.800 --> 23:56.600
So, you know what?

23:56.680 --> 23:58.240
Let me just apologize now.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.800
I'll just apologize in front of you

23:59.880 --> 24:01.880
and the millions of people
that will watch this at home.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.440
I am sorry for divorce.

24:04.800 --> 24:07.720
I am sorry for mass suicides.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.560
I am sorry for corrupting minds.

24:10.840 --> 24:13.440
I am sorry for
leap years and TikTok!

24:19.520 --> 24:23.360
And, sexuality in Bollywood
is very different.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.080
Bollywood is obsessed with water.

24:26.480 --> 24:27.840
I mean, they think you just…

24:28.480 --> 24:31.880
throw some water on
an actress and it's sexy!

24:33.360 --> 24:35.400
I mean, Bollywood and my vegetable vendor…

24:42.520 --> 24:44.320
You know, they think on the same lines.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.520
Just sprinkle some water on it,
it'll sell.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.520
One of the best lines I get
from producers and directors is,

24:52.600 --> 24:54.960
"This role is going to change your image."

24:55.520 --> 24:58.160
I just don't even know
what to do with people like this.

24:58.640 --> 25:02.200
Has anybody ever thought
that I don't want to change my career?

25:02.280 --> 25:04.680
That I am perfectly happy the way I am?

25:09.040 --> 25:09.880
So…

25:12.040 --> 25:15.840
people keep reminding me
about my career in porn

25:16.240 --> 25:17.840
as if I should be ashamed of it.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.800
As if, you know,

25:20.000 --> 25:22.960
they're judging me thinking,
"Oh, that Sunny!

25:23.280 --> 25:25.200
She's everywhere in a bikini.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.760
Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! Yuck!

25:27.440 --> 25:31.920
In the ATM line,
at grocery stores, at funerals."

25:33.440 --> 25:35.960
Yes, I just wake up in
the morning and don a bikini.

25:37.760 --> 25:40.800
But the reality
will blow your mind that actually

25:41.240 --> 25:42.720
might change my image.

25:43.040 --> 25:46.440
Because I actually
spend my whole day with my three kids,

25:46.720 --> 25:49.840
who are either puking, pissing or pooping.

25:51.160 --> 25:54.680
Or hysterically laughing
at the other one because they are

25:55.000 --> 25:57.080
puking, pissing or pooping.

26:04.520 --> 26:07.920
So, I could care less about the haters.

26:08.520 --> 26:12.680
Because I'm sitting on my
couch with my oh-so-sexy husband

26:12.960 --> 26:16.920
and three beautiful children,
a glass of wine, zero regrets.

26:17.080 --> 26:20.080
And that, my friends, is my happy ending.

26:27.600 --> 26:30.040
Give it up for Sunny Leone, everyone!

26:31.200 --> 26:32.680
You did it! You did it!

26:33.360 --> 26:34.640
-Oh, my gosh!
-You survived!

26:37.400 --> 26:38.560
Are you kidding?

26:38.920 --> 26:40.560
I'm so happy it's over.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.080
My God!

26:42.680 --> 26:44.320
Thank you so much for doing this!
Did you have a good time?

26:44.520 --> 26:47.320
Yeah, I did.
You guys are amazing, thank you so much!

26:49.720 --> 26:51.800
Sunny, you plan to do this
again anytime soon?

26:51.880 --> 26:54.000
No, no.
You only can pop your cherry once.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.280
Alright, give it up for Sunny Leone,
everyone!

27:00.240 --> 27:02.120
Let's give it up for Neeti Palta!

27:02.520 --> 27:03.720
And I'm your host, Sapan Verma.

27:03.800 --> 27:05.800
This is One Mic Stand.
Thank you so much, bye-bye!

27:06.200 --> 27:07.200
Good night.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.160
Do it again?

27:20.440 --> 27:23.240
What? No! That's why I said
you can only pop your cherry once.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.240
Man!

27:24.320 --> 27:25.760
How did it feel though?
When you got on the stage?

27:25.840 --> 27:27.200
-You were very nervous before.
-Yeah.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.040
How did it feel when you got
on the stage and got your first laugh?

27:29.120 --> 27:31.120
I was just hoping
it would continue that way.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.120
-But, I saw your body language change.
-Yeah.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.480
Firstly, when you walked on itself,
there was confidence.

27:35.680 --> 27:37.840
But at what point did you
feel the change in yourself?

27:37.960 --> 27:38.880
I know my stories.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.960
-It's just, the punchlines were like…
-Yeah.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.040
Shit! Am I going to remember?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.600
I think you were as nervous as her?

27:44.720 --> 27:46.120
Yeah. I was sweating!

27:46.240 --> 27:47.160
Before, I was…

27:47.240 --> 27:49.080
"Oh, my God!"
I'm like, sitting there like this.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.600
Then midway through, I was like…

27:50.800 --> 27:52.280
almost embarrassed for myself!

27:54.360 --> 27:56.440
Awesome!
Thank you so much for doing this!

27:56.600 --> 27:58.680
-This is amazing!
-Thank you for having me!
