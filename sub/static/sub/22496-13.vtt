00:37.154 --> 00:39.622
James, Sirius, Peter ...
the moon is out!

00:39.624 --> 00:42.749
I'm... turning into a werewolf!

00:43.395 --> 00:47.505
Don't worry, friend!
We'll transform into animals with you!

00:48.233 --> 00:50.133
Follow him!
We have to get somewhere isolated!

00:50.135 --> 00:52.135
Hold on. Where's James?

00:52.137 --> 00:54.337
Okay. That's it. Easy, girl...

00:54.339 --> 00:56.473
James!
What the hell are you doing?!

00:56.475 --> 00:58.174
I'm going to [bleep] this deer.

00:58.176 --> 01:00.710
- You know, when in Rome...
- What do you mean, "when in Rome"?

01:00.712 --> 01:04.001
Like, I wouldn't normally
do shrooms, but if I went to

01:04.001 --> 01:07.650
- burning man, of course I'd do shrooms.
- This isn't shrooms!

01:07.652 --> 01:10.286
- It's bestiality!
- No! Bestiality would be if

01:10.288 --> 01:12.105
I were a human [bleep] a deer.

01:12.106 --> 01:13.923
But I'm a deer [bleep] a deer.

01:13.925 --> 01:16.760
- Now, if you'll excuse me...
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:16.762 --> 01:18.495
- That's gross!
- Oh, come on.

01:18.497 --> 01:21.431
- You've never [bleep] a dog?
- No!

01:21.433 --> 01:23.533
- Liar!
- Okay, I led him far into

01:23.535 --> 01:25.368
the woods where he can't hurt anyone.

01:25.370 --> 01:27.237
Peter, you [bleep] rats, don't you?

01:27.239 --> 01:29.939
- Ew! No!
- I mean, when you're a rat.

01:29.941 --> 01:32.242
- Oh, yeah, of course.
- Gentlemen, are we going to

01:32.244 --> 01:35.271
- bone or what?
- All: Professor McGonagall?!

01:35.614 --> 01:37.380
The female anatomy looks like this.

01:37.382 --> 01:39.215
Come on, guys.

01:39.217 --> 01:42.719
- Let's try to be mature here.
- It's pink.

01:42.721 --> 01:45.155
But, Bruce, there's a party going on!

01:45.157 --> 01:48.224
Sorry, doll, I need
to check on my piano.

01:48.226 --> 01:55.932
I just had it tuned.

01:55.934 --> 01:59.169
Have you guys seen
Bruce Wayne's piano?!

01:59.171 --> 02:02.205
All right, Joker, you can
run, but you can't hide.

02:03.345 --> 02:05.875
Uh-oh.

02:05.877 --> 02:08.913
And that's just a warm-up.

02:09.781 --> 02:11.448
Crap! Crap! Crap! Crap!

02:11.449 --> 02:13.116
Who is touching my things?!

02:18.657 --> 02:20.256
Stop playing the piano!

02:20.258 --> 02:22.592
I hate bats!
And yet they motivate me!

02:22.594 --> 02:24.627
I'm so complicated!

02:24.629 --> 02:28.498
Mr. Wayne, what's happening?!

02:30.735 --> 02:32.969
And now a little something

02:32.971 --> 02:36.773
from my own album!

02:38.542 --> 02:41.244
Please, I've been walking since July!

02:41.246 --> 02:43.813
I ... I can't get down! Please!

02:43.815 --> 02:46.114
Why won't anyone help me?

02:48.553 --> 02:50.553
Back, beast!
Nothing will stop me from

02:50.555 --> 02:51.662
avenging my family!

02:51.663 --> 02:54.678
<i>Family... Family...

- Fighting aliens is fun and

03:58.857 --> 04:02.725
all, but I'll always regret
never becoming an artist.

04:02.727 --> 04:06.229
Someone hungry for a bite of killdozer?!

04:09.600 --> 04:14.170
- Take a bite of this juicy apple!
- Is it organic?

04:14.172 --> 04:17.072
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- Was it made with growth hormones?

04:17.075 --> 04:19.309
I don't think so.

04:19.310 --> 04:21.177
- Look, just eat the apple.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:21.178 --> 04:23.546
I really can't eat this apple
unless I know it's free of

04:23.548 --> 04:26.082
- hormones or pesticides.
- Oh, that's fair.

04:26.084 --> 04:29.252
Yes, I have the apple's
paperwork right here in my...

04:29.254 --> 04:32.040
Ohh! Ohh!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:32.298 --> 04:35.191
<i>We've crashed into
Dune's Southern desert.</i>

04:35.193 --> 04:38.194
We must get to the rocks.
Only there will we be safe from

04:38.196 --> 04:40.496
- the giant sandworms.
- They're attracted to the sound

04:40.498 --> 04:43.499
- of our footfalls, right?
- Yes, but as long as you walk

04:43.501 --> 04:47.637
without rhythm, you
won't attract the worm.

04:48.039 --> 04:52.075
Uh, Jamal, why don't you hang
back and give us a head start?

04:52.077 --> 04:54.544
What?
I can walk without rhythm.

04:54.546 --> 04:57.247
- Watch this!
- Look at me! I'm doing it!

04:57.249 --> 04:59.282
Yes, one foot in front
of the other, see?

04:59.284 --> 05:01.618
Just makin' my way ... uh-oh.
Oh, no. Wait.

05:01.620 --> 05:06.155
H-hold on.

05:06.157 --> 05:08.558
<i>Jamal!</i>

05:08.560 --> 05:11.160
He died.
But, damn, he looked cool doing it.

05:11.662 --> 05:15.232
Welcome to
"Legends of the hidden temple"!

05:15.233 --> 05:17.033
I'm your host, Kirk Fogg, and

05:17.035 --> 05:20.903
this is Olmec, guardian of
the temple and its legends.

05:20.905 --> 05:23.473
- Hey, there, Kirk.
- Olmec and I have been buddies

05:23.475 --> 05:25.575
for a long time, isn't
that right, Olmec?

05:25.577 --> 05:28.011
<i>Long time.... Long time...</i>

05:28.013 --> 05:30.577
- Long time...
- Doba una nabayuma chuk laka Olmec.

05:30.612 --> 05:33.684
He says that he is
showing you the statue of Olmec,

05:33.685 --> 05:35.351
the all-powerful god of the

05:35.353 --> 05:37.654
- Nabayuma people.
- He will be perfect for our

05:37.656 --> 05:40.423
- children's game show.
- Wait. What?

05:42.827 --> 05:45.739
All right! Move, move, move!

05:45.740 --> 05:49.098
Slime them!
Slime them all!

05:55.005 --> 05:56.606
<i>Olmec? Olmec!</i>

05:56.608 --> 05:59.809
- I said, what's today's legend?
- Uh, oh!

05:59.811 --> 06:02.745
Uh, sorry, Kirk. Today's legend is...

06:02.747 --> 06:06.716
- "The necklace of Marie Curie."
- Thank you, Olmec!

06:09.624 --> 06:11.858
What's the matter, Lassie?

06:11.860 --> 06:13.960
Nope. I ain't coming, girl.

06:13.962 --> 06:16.563
I told him a thousand times to
stop playing around that well.

06:16.565 --> 06:18.565
It's dangerous. He'll
have to figure something

06:18.567 --> 06:21.501
out for himself, [bleep] punk kid.

06:26.841 --> 06:29.326
<i>Lassie! Help!</i>

<i>* We are the Chipmunks *</i>

06:31.813 --> 06:35.148
<i>October 27, 2013. Salt Lake City.</i>

06:35.150 --> 06:38.251
<i>Alvin falls onstage.
Word quickly spreads that he</i>

06:38.253 --> 06:41.688
<i>has, in fact, died.
October 29, 2013.</i>

06:41.690 --> 06:44.190
<i>San Diego. Alvin is back.</i>

06:44.192 --> 06:46.593
<i>The rumors, it seems, were false.</i>

06:46.595 --> 06:49.729
<i>But in November, a photograph
from Chipmunks manager</i>

06:49.731 --> 06:52.198
<i>David Seville's backyard goes viral.</i>

06:52.200 --> 06:54.667
<i>Pressure mounts.
By early December, Seville can</i>

06:54.669 --> 06:57.871
- no longer dodge the scrutiny.
- I'm surprised nobody called

06:57.873 --> 07:01.241
me out on this earlier.
The Chipmunks have been

07:01.243 --> 07:04.177
touring since 1958.
The average life-span of

07:04.179 --> 07:06.613
a Chipmunk is three years.
You can do the math.

07:06.615 --> 07:08.515
Is it true you destroyed
the death certificates?

07:08.517 --> 07:10.150
There are no death certificates.

07:10.152 --> 07:12.318
- They are rodents.
- Will you surrender the

07:12.320 --> 07:14.521
corpses to authorities
for full autopsies?

07:14.523 --> 07:18.057
Again, they are rodents.
Legally speaking, I could throw

07:18.059 --> 07:20.777
them down a well. In fact, I
accidentally ran over one of

07:20.778 --> 07:23.496
the Simons, and I simply
replaced him with a new Chipmunk

07:23.498 --> 07:26.132
from the crate of spare
Chipmunks I keep in the

07:26.134 --> 07:28.001
back of my jeep.

07:28.003 --> 07:29.670
My jeep smells awful.

07:35.677 --> 07:38.645
Welcome to the Princess Summit,
where we address the

07:38.647 --> 07:41.181
complex political issues
facing our kingdoms.

07:41.183 --> 07:43.082
- Hairstyles!
- Talking pets!

07:43.084 --> 07:45.385
Hairstyles for our talking pets!

07:45.387 --> 07:47.287
Crabs! I've got crabs.

07:47.289 --> 07:52.158
Well, isn't that just, um...
And where's our newest princess?

07:52.160 --> 07:55.762
Ach! Sorry I'm late!
I killed a boar on the way here.

07:55.764 --> 07:58.731
Oh, you're so
feminist and empowered...

07:58.733 --> 08:01.100
- Great.
- 'Ey, wee beastie!

08:01.102 --> 08:04.103
Have we got to grievances yet?
A bunch of wee dwarves are

08:04.105 --> 08:08.074
- illegally mining me territory!
- Oh, Merida, you have far

08:08.076 --> 08:10.977
bigger problems.
Let me tell you about them.

08:10.979 --> 08:14.581
- Not a damn song.
- # Here's a list of things to drop #

08:14.583 --> 08:17.550
* your accent, bow, that tangled mop *

08:17.552 --> 08:20.320
* fifteen pounds from off your hips *

08:20.322 --> 08:23.156
* those ginger afros 'neath your pits *

08:23.158 --> 08:25.592
* and no prince will want to mingle *

08:25.594 --> 08:28.061
* with a girl with no hit single *

08:28.063 --> 08:32.732
- And your pet's hair is a disaster.
- That's me mother!

08:32.734 --> 08:36.535
She's a bear!
The trailer was very misleading!

08:36.538 --> 08:41.073
I came here lookin' for justice!
Instead, I found treachery.

08:41.076 --> 08:45.311
- Prepare yourself... for war.
- Someone finally said it!

08:45.313 --> 08:47.480
See you on the killing
fields, round eyes!

08:47.482 --> 08:50.216
- Amen, sister!
- Stuck up bitches.

08:52.170 --> 08:54.120
Ooh, that Merida!

08:54.122 --> 08:57.557
I'll show her!
Send in my war council!

08:57.559 --> 09:00.268
What shall I do, little one?

09:00.375 --> 09:01.914
_

09:01.949 --> 09:03.165
Oh, my.

09:03.166 --> 09:04.636
_

09:04.671 --> 09:06.666
Okay, okay, I get it, I get it.

09:06.668 --> 09:09.602
- We need weapons!
- I've got a guy.

09:09.604 --> 09:13.406
Oh! Good idea!
We'll fight them with magic.

09:13.408 --> 09:16.309
Bibbity boppity boo.
That's 20 grand.

09:16.311 --> 09:18.611
- Oh, wow.
- Do you need thingamabobs?

09:18.613 --> 09:21.214
- I've got thingamabobs!
- Nobody cares about the dildo

09:21.216 --> 09:24.851
collection you dredged up from
the Atlantic, you fishy bitch.

09:27.155 --> 09:30.723
- Anyone else have cold tits?
- All right, ladies!

09:30.725 --> 09:34.794
- Show me what you've got!
- Hyah! Hyah!

09:34.796 --> 09:39.332
I finally found the perfect
conditioner ... blood!

09:39.334 --> 09:42.568
- Oh, curse these stubby arms!
- You're an alligator.

09:42.570 --> 09:46.439
- Be an alligator!
- Wait! Don't ...

09:46.441 --> 09:49.375
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no. It was a ...

09:49.377 --> 09:50.655
It was a good kill.

09:50.656 --> 09:54.186
Not all of us will
live to wish upon a star

09:54.187 --> 09:57.717
tonight, but we give our
lives for a greater good.

09:57.719 --> 10:00.414
Oh, dear.
I think I'm getting sleepy.

10:00.415 --> 10:02.255
I might have to sit
this one out, guys...

10:02.257 --> 10:06.225
- Don't you pull that shit now!
- Just teasing ... unh!

10:06.227 --> 10:09.195
Bring me the scalp
and/or weave of Snow White!

10:09.197 --> 10:12.532
- Charge!
- I will show you a world of death!

10:12.534 --> 10:14.033
Look everyone!

10:14.035 --> 10:17.103
I brought my thingamabob!
My weapons-grade thingamabob!

10:17.105 --> 10:19.672
Oh, you just don't
know what words are.

10:19.674 --> 10:22.275
That's your thing.

10:22.277 --> 10:24.377
Run away! Run away!

10:24.379 --> 10:27.141
* Bend over and grab your ankles ... *
