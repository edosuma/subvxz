"Thank you" for letting Freddie

00:09.643 --> 00:11.143
It's the miracle worker
with the big, blue eyes.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.212
- Does he seem like
he's kind of a player?

00:13.214 --> 00:14.480
- A player's what you need.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.148
- Jamie, I need your help.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.183

- Not by a long shot.

01:02.596 --> 01:06.565
- The problems Chief Boden faces
are regrettable.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.100
Our thoughts are with him

01:08.102 --> 01:11.070
as he deals
with his private legal matters,

01:11.072 --> 01:13.605
but those thoughts
are for outside these walls.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.574
In here, we have sworn

01:15.576 --> 01:18.077

personal troubles aside

01:18.079 --> 01:20.612

the citizens of Chicago.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.281
Now, in order to do that,

01:22.283 --> 01:25.384
we have to have
unassailable leadership.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.321
- How'd you get the money?

01:29.323 --> 01:30.456

against the house.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.590
- What?

01:31.592 --> 01:32.791
- I wasn't gonna let you
sit in a jail cell

01:32.793 --> 01:36.728
one minute longer.
I just wasn't.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.630

it is my honor

01:38.632 --> 01:41.400

01:41.402 --> 01:43.669

02:03.424 --> 02:05.290
They're saying
aggravated assault,

02:05.292 --> 02:07.843

Now that witness is missing.

02:10.397 --> 02:14.800
We'll get through this.
Okay?

02:14.802 --> 02:17.503

about the past.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.672
What I can do,
is affect the future.

02:20.674 --> 02:24.776
Professionalism, respect,

I'm asking you to trust me.

02:34.321 --> 02:38.190

03:03.918 --> 03:05.784

- Dismissed.

03:10.724 --> 03:15.194
Joe.

- Yeah, I know.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.902
I feel badly about this,
I do.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.771
But Freddie came
by when First Watch was here,

03:25.773 --> 03:28.240

what to do with him.

what's all this?

07:01.688 --> 07:03.789
- Dough ornaments.

07:03.790 --> 07:05.891
I paint them and bake them
so they harden, then I add hooks

07:05.893 --> 07:08.760
and you can hang--
- You can't have these here.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.096
- But Chief Boden lets
me use the bullpen every year.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.631
My apartment's too small to--

07:12.633 --> 07:16.101

I have to deal with,

07:16.103 --> 07:18.670
this is not one of them.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.672

but there are children

07:41.929 --> 07:44.062
I need to pull my car
around and load these up.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.231
There's about a dozen more
containers in the bullpen.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.834
- Actually,
we have a different plan.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.235
- But Chief Patterson
said I couldn't use--

07:50.237 --> 07:51.670

we heard what he said,

07:51.672 --> 07:53.972
but, uh, what he doesn't know
won't hurt him.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.707

ornaments this year...

07:55.709 --> 07:58.109
- Yup.
- Hell or high water.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.479

08:01.782 --> 08:04.683
- My first year on the job,
we were at Jewel getting food

08:04.685 --> 08:08.086

just started screaming at us.

the same thing.

you looking into her guys?

she needs me to do it, okay?

She's a good girl.

we can talk? private?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.342
You okay?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.810

10:11.812 --> 10:13.945
The allegations,
that he was arrested.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.080
- Yeah.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.716
- Something's going on.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.050
- What do you mean?

10:19.052 --> 10:21.119
- Yesterday, I was hit
with two separate lawsuits

all saying I have unpaid bills
on credits cards I don't own.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.392

I got a third.

there's a connection?
