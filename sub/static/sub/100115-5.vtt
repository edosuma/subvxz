WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.524
[Archie]
Previously onRiverdale...

00:02.567 --> 00:03.438
Jughead?

00:04.091 --> 00:05.614
Moose!

00:05.657 --> 00:06.919
What the hell?

00:06.963 --> 00:08.834
[Jughead]
Wait, are you my roommate?

00:08.878 --> 00:11.185
Hermione Lodge,
you're under arrest for
conspiracy to commit murder.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.534
Your own husband's.

00:12.577 --> 00:14.710
Mija,I'm not paying
for your crimes.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.191
I told the world what you are.

00:17.234 --> 00:18.931
Deal with it.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.411
I think you'd make
an excellent candidate

00:20.455 --> 00:22.109
for the Junior
FBI Training Program.

00:22.152 --> 00:24.415
So are you warming up
to our half-brother now?

00:24.459 --> 00:26.200
[Betty on headphones]
Yeah. Kind of.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.637
[Jughead] I'm just glad that
Charles was there for you.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.291
[Munroe] Didn't we say
we were gonna turn this place
into a community center?

00:30.334 --> 00:31.335
[Archie] Feels like it's time.

00:31.379 --> 00:32.902
No one is safe here.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.165
Is that really the town
that you want to invest in?

00:35.209 --> 00:38.255
You're not actually
considering fighting crime
in those tights, are you?

00:38.299 --> 00:39.039
Of course not.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.780
I'm going to need a mask.

00:43.608 --> 00:46.568
[Jughead] They say every town
gets the hero it deserves.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.135
Riverdale's was Archie Andrews.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.138
High school athlete by day,

00:51.181 --> 00:53.662
would-be crime fighter
by night.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.577
Patrolling the shadows
of Sketch Alley,

00:55.620 --> 00:57.187
down by the Southside Docks,

00:57.231 --> 00:59.320
where Archie's
community center is.

00:59.363 --> 01:02.279
You wouldn't want
to be caught there
too long after dark.

01:02.323 --> 01:04.107
That's when the rats came out.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.632
[footsteps approaching]

01:13.160 --> 01:14.074
[screams]

01:19.166 --> 01:21.168
[breathing heavily]

01:24.823 --> 01:26.347
-Here.
-Stay away from me.

01:26.390 --> 01:27.652
[groans]

01:29.959 --> 01:31.308
[gasping]

01:31.352 --> 01:32.788
[Jughead] All in all,

01:32.831 --> 01:35.051
not an auspicious
second outing

01:35.095 --> 01:37.314
for Riverdale's
dark-suited vigilante.

01:39.969 --> 01:42.058
[school bell ringing]

01:42.102 --> 01:43.712
And speaking
of crime-fighting...

01:43.755 --> 01:47.498
Kev, what are your
after-school plans?

01:47.542 --> 01:49.413
Cruising the bathrooms
at Sheds and Royal.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.936
Perfect.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.939
Then you can join me
for my first Junior FBI class.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.941
The one that your hot
half-brother is teaching?

01:55.985 --> 01:57.160
Yes.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.379
I asked Charles
if you could enroll,

01:58.422 --> 02:00.163
and he said everyone's welcome.

02:00.207 --> 02:02.209
Remind me, is your brother
gay or straight?

02:04.428 --> 02:06.387
I actually have no idea,

02:06.430 --> 02:08.389
but seniors from a bunch
of different high schools

02:08.432 --> 02:09.825
have signed up,
so who knows?

02:09.868 --> 02:12.262
Maybe you'll meet a cute,
gay FBI agent-in-training.

02:12.871 --> 02:13.959
I'm in.

02:14.003 --> 02:15.178
When and where?

02:15.222 --> 02:16.875
Seems that
the District Attorney

02:16.919 --> 02:18.225
is pinning her entire case

02:18.268 --> 02:20.314
on linking you
to Hiram's would-be murderer,

02:20.357 --> 02:23.404
-Tall Boy Petite.
-Which is absurd.

02:23.447 --> 02:25.319
I mean, I've never even had
any interaction with the man.

02:25.362 --> 02:28.235
Well, there is still the issue
of the large sum of money

02:28.278 --> 02:30.237
the police found in
your monogrammed Tucci bag

02:30.280 --> 02:31.542
in Tall Boy's apartment.

02:31.586 --> 02:33.196
Obviously, Hiram planted it
there to frame me.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.851
FP will testify
that he searched
Tall Boy's apartment

02:35.894 --> 02:37.722
right after he died.

02:37.766 --> 02:40.203
He'll swear that there
was no bag of money
in evidence at that time.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.292
This week is insane.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.860
I've got two papers due,

02:44.903 --> 02:46.078
your trial's starting,

02:46.122 --> 02:47.645
Daddy's trial
is around the corner.

02:47.689 --> 02:49.256
From what I've heard,
the federal prosecutor's

02:49.299 --> 02:51.214
going after your father
pretty hard.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.433
Oh, believe me, I know,

02:52.476 --> 02:53.869
I've been meeting
with her on the DL.

02:53.912 --> 02:55.784
Goals for this week?

02:55.827 --> 02:57.394
Get Mom out of jail,

02:57.438 --> 02:59.701
and make sure Daddy
stays rotting in his.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.443
[Donna] What you working on?

03:02.486 --> 03:05.272
Same thing as when
you drugged me, Donna.

03:05.315 --> 03:07.056
Except this time
I actually found something.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.624
I know the Stonewall Four
is supposed to be
an urban legend,

03:09.667 --> 03:11.669
but when I checked
the town paper,

03:11.713 --> 03:14.237
four people had
actually gone missing

03:14.281 --> 03:15.369
over the last 30 years.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.022
That's exactly
what happened to Moose.

03:17.066 --> 03:18.241
Marmaduke is fine.

03:18.285 --> 03:20.678
He's just busy
in basic training.

03:21.505 --> 03:22.332
Look...

03:23.899 --> 03:25.117
We've been texting.

03:27.424 --> 03:31.254
[Mr. Chipping] You guys
are in for a treat.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.475
Advanced copies
of my latest novel.

03:34.518 --> 03:35.954
It doesn't hit stores
till Christmas,

03:35.998 --> 03:37.217
so no spoilers.

03:39.306 --> 03:40.611
Wait. Mr. Chipping,

03:40.655 --> 03:42.874
you wrote a
Baxter Brothers Mystery?

03:42.918 --> 03:44.267
Were you Franklin P. Paxton?

03:44.311 --> 03:45.964
I am. Well...

03:46.704 --> 03:48.489
It's my nom de plume.

03:48.532 --> 03:51.100
But The Secret of the Old
Windmillcame out like, what,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.015
decades ago?
How's that possible?

03:53.058 --> 03:56.192
I'm merely the latest
in a long line of ghostwriters
over the decades.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.281
My mind is blown.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.935
Mr. Chipping, I used
to love these books
when I was a kid.

03:59.978 --> 04:03.286
They were my gateway drug
into serious crime fiction.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288
[snorts]

04:05.332 --> 04:07.551
[Mr. Chipping]
Well, then you're in luck.

04:07.595 --> 04:10.075
To celebrate the publication
of Ten Little Boy Scouts,

04:10.119 --> 04:12.687
Stonewall Prep is throwing me
a little wine and cheese,

04:12.730 --> 04:14.166
to which you all are invited,

04:15.124 --> 04:16.995
as are previous ghostwriters.

04:19.563 --> 04:22.000
-[door opens]
-[bell chimes]

04:22.044 --> 04:23.263
[music plays on radio]

04:24.916 --> 04:26.135
What's wrong, Pop?

04:27.179 --> 04:29.486
It's a subpoena.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.358
From your father's
defense team.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.402
Oh, no. [sighs]

04:34.535 --> 04:36.885
They're probably gonna
ask if you doctored
La Bonne Nuit's books

04:36.928 --> 04:38.321
to make my father look guilty.

04:38.365 --> 04:39.627
Which I did.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.455
And I have no regrets
about that, Veronica,

04:41.498 --> 04:43.326
you needed the help.

04:43.370 --> 04:47.330
But I cannot place my hand
on a Bible and say otherwise.

04:47.374 --> 04:49.376
Let me get into it
with the federal prosecutor.

04:49.419 --> 04:50.725
But don't worry, Pop.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.292
I'm not going to let you
get caught up in this.

04:54.381 --> 04:58.210
Just when I thought
you couldn't possibly
go any lower,

04:58.254 --> 04:59.603
you proved me wrong, Daddy.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.388
Pop Tate is a good man.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.738
There is no need to drag him
into the mess of your trial.

05:03.781 --> 05:05.392
I'm fighting for my freedom.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.480
And to be clear,

05:06.523 --> 05:08.264
I didn't drag Pop into this,
you did.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.353
Because you were extorting me.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.574
You can spare Pop
and end this right now, mija.

05:13.617 --> 05:16.011
Come clean to the Feds,
admit you framed me.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.360
Hard pass.

05:17.404 --> 05:20.189
Well, then I'll be seeing
Pop Tates in court.

05:20.232 --> 05:23.148
And tell your mom
good luck on her case.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.280
I'll be rooting for her.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.720
[Veronica] We have a problem.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.462
If Pop takes the stand,
he'll tell the truth.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.638
And before you ask, no,

05:34.682 --> 05:37.598
Ms. Federal Prosecutor,
I won't tell Pop to lie.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.426
Your father's broken
many laws, Veronica,

05:39.469 --> 05:41.515
but those books
you provided the FBI,

05:41.558 --> 05:43.255
proving Hiram's guilt,

05:43.299 --> 05:44.431
are at the heart of our case.

05:44.474 --> 05:45.606
Call me as a witness.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.608
I'll testify that
I was the one

05:47.651 --> 05:49.653
who tasked Pop
with doctoring the books

05:49.697 --> 05:51.089
as a last resort

05:51.133 --> 05:52.656
because my father
was extorting me.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.005
Which is the truth.

05:56.921 --> 05:59.402
Once I do that,

05:59.446 --> 06:01.012
I doubt they'll want
to spend much time

06:01.056 --> 06:02.231
talking about any books.

06:02.274 --> 06:03.624
Okay.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.278
Meanwhile, good luck
with your mother's case.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.631
For our first session,
I thought we'd start

06:10.674 --> 06:12.763
right in the deep end
of the swimming pool.

06:12.807 --> 06:14.504
With serial killers.

06:14.548 --> 06:17.464
[softly]
Your half-brother is so hot.

06:17.507 --> 06:20.118
Now, I've put together a little
exercise to kick us off.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.078
This is a crime scene

06:23.121 --> 06:25.472
where six victims were found
buried along a riverbank

06:25.515 --> 06:27.474
in the Pacific Northwest.

06:27.517 --> 06:30.477
Now, before I start
filling in all the details,

06:30.520 --> 06:32.696
any guesses on
which one of these men
is the murderer?

06:36.700 --> 06:38.136
It's the third man.

06:39.486 --> 06:40.965
That's correct, Betty.
How did you know that?

06:42.619 --> 06:43.794
I don't know.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.187
Just intuition.

06:45.709 --> 06:46.884
Okay, then.

06:47.929 --> 06:49.147
Let's try another one.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.455
Which one's the serial killer?

06:54.588 --> 06:57.460
[Charles, echoing]
The term "serial killer"
is relatively new.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.331
It wasn't until the 1970s

06:59.375 --> 07:01.464
that the phrase
"serial murderer"
or "serial homicide..."

07:02.552 --> 07:03.597
It's the one in the middle.

07:04.511 --> 07:05.686
Correct again.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.514
Your intuition
is like a sixth sense.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.473
Let's go again.

07:10.517 --> 07:11.561
[projector slide changes]

07:13.171 --> 07:14.956
[Charles, echoing]
When defining a serial killer,

07:14.999 --> 07:18.089
it usually refers to someone
who committed three or--

07:18.133 --> 07:19.482
None of them did it.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.832
Excellent work, Betty.

07:21.876 --> 07:24.661
Not many people have
that kind of raw instinct.

07:24.705 --> 07:29.666
You're like Beautiful Mind,
but... for serial killers.

07:29.710 --> 07:32.669
Now, can any of you guess
what the murderers
all have in common?

07:32.713 --> 07:34.323
Nothing.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.760
Isn't that kind of the point?

07:36.804 --> 07:38.501
Actually, they all have
one thing in common.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.417
A specific set of genes.

07:43.550 --> 07:46.291
[doctor] They discovered
that you have the MAOA...

07:46.335 --> 07:48.642
-and CDH13 genes.
-...CDH13.

07:48.685 --> 07:49.556
Also known as--

07:49.599 --> 07:51.601
The serial killer genes.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.569
Hey, Dad.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.353
Have you seen
my Baxter Brothers books?

08:04.396 --> 08:06.616
I swear I took them
out of the trailer
before it burned.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.400
I don't know. I might've have
thrown them away.

08:09.663 --> 08:10.838
You threw away my books?

08:12.056 --> 08:13.188
All right, calm down, boy.

08:13.231 --> 08:14.755
Before you accuse me
of book burning,

08:14.798 --> 08:16.539
why don't you check the
storage room in the basement?

08:21.675 --> 08:23.677
I used to worship these guys.

08:23.720 --> 08:25.200
When all the kids wanted
to be superheroes,

08:25.243 --> 08:26.549
I wanted to be
a Baxter brother.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.159
[Betty] Oh, my God.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.335
They used to do, uh,
crossovers with Tracy True.

08:30.379 --> 08:32.163
Those were my favorites,
remember?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.905
Yeah. My Dad used
to get me one of these
each year for my birthday.

08:34.949 --> 08:36.080
Hey Dad, why'd you stop?

08:39.214 --> 08:40.432
You outgrew 'em, boy.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.609
I gotta run.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.437
I'm never gonna
outgrow these books.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.743
[Betty laughs]

08:46.787 --> 08:47.875
[Jughead]
This was my favorite.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.754
[Bret] Jones, lights out.

08:57.798 --> 08:59.190
Some of us are trying to sleep.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.648
[indistinct chatter]

09:22.649 --> 09:24.607
[yawns]

09:24.651 --> 09:25.608
Late night, Red?

09:27.001 --> 09:28.611
Algebra Three
is kicking my ass this year.

09:28.655 --> 09:29.830
[man] One of you named Archie?

09:31.875 --> 09:32.963
Yeah, that's me.

09:33.007 --> 09:34.486
This kid say's
you'll vouch for him.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.619
Yeah, that's Toby.
He hangs out here.
Is there a problem?

09:36.663 --> 09:38.882
Yeah, he was shoplifting
in my convenience store.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.450
I was reading comic books.

09:41.493 --> 09:42.669
[shop owner] You were loitering
and then you started to put

09:42.712 --> 09:44.322
this comic book in your jacket.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.672
Look, why don't
I go ahead and pay

09:45.715 --> 09:46.803
for whatever that
comic book costs?

09:46.847 --> 09:47.935
$4.99.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.850
And I don't want
any of you delinquents

09:49.893 --> 09:51.634
stepping foot in my shop.

09:51.678 --> 09:54.071
It's bad enough we have to
walk by this halfway house.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.468
[Munroe] Keep the change.

10:01.731 --> 10:02.863
Grab a brush.

10:11.045 --> 10:13.787
Here is the hero of the hour.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.267
Class, this is
Francis J. DuPont,

10:16.311 --> 10:19.140
the originator of
the Baxter Brothers franchise,

10:19.183 --> 10:22.665
and the very first
Franklin P. Paxton.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.842
Francis, this is Bret, Joan,
Jonathan, Donna, and Jughead.

10:25.886 --> 10:26.669
"Jughead."

10:27.714 --> 10:28.845
Is that a nickname?

10:28.889 --> 10:30.542
Uh, yes, sir. It is.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.849
And it's an honor to meet you.

10:32.893 --> 10:36.374
I didn't have the greatest
home life growing up,

10:36.418 --> 10:39.203
but your books
really helped me through it.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.599
Jughead is the newest addition

10:43.643 --> 10:45.688
to the most promising group of
students that I've ever taught.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.559
[Francis] Really?

10:47.603 --> 10:50.127
Well, is the successor
amongst us, then?

10:50.171 --> 10:51.738
Successor for what?

10:51.781 --> 10:55.785
Chipping has written the last
four Baxter Brothers books.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.352
It's time he pass on
the torch.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.920
Therefore, we're on the hunt
for the next ghostwriter

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
to continue the franchise.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.706
And you're going
to pick one of us?

11:03.750 --> 11:05.055
Keep it in your pants, Jones.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.753
[Mr. Chipping]
Every Baxter Brothers author,

11:06.796 --> 11:08.580
beginning with
Mr. DuPont himself,

11:08.624 --> 11:10.844
has gone to Stonewall Prep.

11:10.887 --> 11:13.150
We're always looking
for young and clever minds

11:13.194 --> 11:14.935
to keep our adventures fresh
and relevant.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.937
Now, if you're interested
in the job,

11:16.980 --> 11:19.069
you'll have to write
the first three chapters

11:19.113 --> 11:21.115
of the next
Baxter Brothers novel.

11:21.158 --> 11:23.073
And an outline
for the rest of it.

11:23.117 --> 11:24.596
[Bret] Well, obviously,
I'm winning this.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.425
Is there any particular style
or subject area?

11:28.862 --> 11:30.733
We have not yet
decided on a theme,

11:30.777 --> 11:31.691
but we'll let you know.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.656
I pulled your files,
Ms. Cooper.

11:40.700 --> 11:45.748
I can confirm that you do have
the MAOA and CDH13 genes.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.971
All good,
nothing to worry about.

11:51.014 --> 11:52.842
I don't have the genes.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.148
See, I told you.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.366
What a relief.

12:11.078 --> 12:12.601
You got to be kidding me.

12:20.217 --> 12:21.175
Hey!

12:21.218 --> 12:23.133
Get the hell away
from that car!

12:23.177 --> 12:24.874
-[tools clatter]
-[panting]

12:38.845 --> 12:39.759
[gun cocks]

12:40.411 --> 12:41.456
Who are you?

12:49.420 --> 12:50.291
You run with Dodger?

12:51.858 --> 12:52.989
Get the hell out of here.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.251
Go!

12:54.295 --> 12:55.775
Tell him it's over.
Tell him, he's done for.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.141
All right, listen up.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.232
Sheriff Jones gave us a call.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.711
Apparently some
of Dodger's crew

13:19.755 --> 13:21.409
was stealing hubcaps
last night.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.628
He suspects it was someone
from this center,

13:23.672 --> 13:25.717
and I gave him my word
that it wasn't any of you guys.

13:25.761 --> 13:26.762
And I hope that's true.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.546
Anyone running
with Dodger's crew

13:28.590 --> 13:30.200
is going to end up in juvie

13:30.244 --> 13:31.941
or in an early grave.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.030
And trust us,
you don't wanna go to juvie.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.640
Look, if even one of you guys
gets arrested,

13:35.684 --> 13:37.033
this whole place
gets shut down.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.687
So, new rule.

13:38.730 --> 13:40.732
If you run with Dodger's crew,
then you're not welcome here.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.952
That's it. No exceptions.

13:42.996 --> 13:44.301
Any questions?

13:44.345 --> 13:45.737
Yeah, I got a question.

13:46.956 --> 13:48.349
Aren't you guys seniors?

13:48.392 --> 13:49.741
What happens
when you graduate
and go to college?

13:52.092 --> 13:53.223
That's months away, Toby.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
Yeah, but what happens?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.313
You said it yourself,
they're trying
to shut you down.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.924
Why? Because of us.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.012
Because no one wants us.

13:59.055 --> 14:00.535
At least Dodger cares.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.754
Dodger only cares about
the money you can bring in.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.887
We want you here,
but you can't have it
both ways.

14:04.931 --> 14:05.888
You have to choose.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.116
One thing we see
in a lot of serial killers

14:16.159 --> 14:18.596
are instances of animal cruelty
in their youth.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.686
Jeffrey Dahmer,
the cannibal of Milwaukee,

14:21.730 --> 14:23.558
started killing dogs
when he was in grade school.

14:23.601 --> 14:26.082
Ian Brady,
the infamous Moors murderer,

14:26.126 --> 14:27.910
killed his first cat
when he was ten.

14:27.954 --> 14:31.131
I'm all the dark deeds
you did in our youths,

14:31.174 --> 14:33.698
like what we did
to our old cat, Caramel.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.396
Caramel ran away.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.833
I didn't do anything to her.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.271
Oh, Betty, we both know
that we drowned Caramel.

14:41.315 --> 14:43.143
[Charles] Robert Thompson
used to tie rabbits

14:43.186 --> 14:44.100
-to railway tracks...
-[gasps]

14:45.406 --> 14:47.147
Betty? Are you okay?

14:47.190 --> 14:48.278
I need a...

14:48.322 --> 14:49.845
I need some air. Sorry.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.722
[FP] I arrived
at the cabin alone.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.420
The suspect, Tall Boy,

14:59.463 --> 15:00.987
he got violent.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.163
Resisted arrest,

15:03.206 --> 15:04.991
and unfortunately,
I had to discharge my weapon.

15:05.034 --> 15:08.342
He expired on his way
to the hospital.

15:08.385 --> 15:11.388
And later, when you searched
Tall Boy's motel room,

15:11.432 --> 15:14.957
did you find
Hermione Lodge's
Tucci bag full of cash?

15:15.349 --> 15:16.959
No.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.831
And yet, the prosecution claims
they found the bag there.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.616
If it was,
it was planted later.

15:21.659 --> 15:22.704
Thank you, Sheriff.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.967
Your witness, Counselor.

15:28.101 --> 15:30.320
The cabin where you claim
to have shot Tall Boy,

15:30.364 --> 15:32.061
do you know who owns
that cabin, Sheriff?

15:32.105 --> 15:33.976
I assumed it was Hiram's.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.152
This is a copy of the lease.

15:36.196 --> 15:37.371
Kindly read the owner's name.

15:45.161 --> 15:46.554
"Hermione Lodge."

15:46.597 --> 15:48.686
-[gallery chattering excitedly]
-[judge] Order!

15:48.730 --> 15:50.862
-[banging gavel]
-Order!

16:10.447 --> 16:11.840
[Jughead]
Excuse me, Mr. DuPont.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.148
Did you happen to know
my grandfather?

16:16.105 --> 16:19.021
Forsythe Jones the First?

16:21.415 --> 16:24.418
That is why you look familiar.

16:24.461 --> 16:26.898
Your grandfather
was an excellent writer.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.292
Tell me, how's he doing?

16:29.336 --> 16:30.946
Does he still write?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.079
I... I actually I don't know,

16:33.122 --> 16:34.819
I've never met him.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.125
Up until this exact moment,
I didn't even know
he was a writer.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.127
Bit of a brawler, too.

16:38.171 --> 16:40.825
Forsythe got into
all kinds of rabble-rousing

16:40.869 --> 16:42.262
before he left Stonewall.

16:42.305 --> 16:43.828
Is that why he left?

16:43.872 --> 16:44.916
He was kicked out for fighting?

16:44.960 --> 16:46.092
Oh, it was so long ago,

16:46.135 --> 16:48.224
I don't remember
the exact circumstances.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.966
But I will never
forget his talent.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.837
We would read
his works in class

16:52.881 --> 16:55.405
and I couldn't believe
that a teenager wrote them.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.277
Does your father write?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.061
No, he's a sheriff.

16:59.105 --> 17:02.760
Would you invite your father
to the reception tomorrow?

17:02.804 --> 17:05.850
I would love to meet
Forsythe's son.

17:05.894 --> 17:07.896
[sighs] Yeah,
I'll see if he can come.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.031
Thank you.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.949
Mrs. Andrews
is back-channeling
with the DA's office.

17:17.993 --> 17:19.168
They're talking plea deals.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.474
Mom...

17:22.128 --> 17:23.259
why didn't you tell us

17:23.303 --> 17:24.130
that the cabin
was under your name?

17:25.261 --> 17:27.133
Because it wasn't.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.918
[chuckles] Veronica,
your father must have
forged the lease or...

17:29.961 --> 17:31.659
contract or something.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.139
So then why didn't you say

17:33.182 --> 17:34.923
that you'd never even
been to this cabin?

17:37.360 --> 17:38.057
Because I have.

17:44.150 --> 17:45.325
Mom...

17:45.368 --> 17:46.587
it's now or never.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.113
I need you
to tell me the truth

17:51.157 --> 17:52.288
about everything,

17:52.332 --> 17:53.811
so I can help you.

17:55.161 --> 17:56.988
[Mary] If everything
you've told me is true,

17:57.032 --> 17:58.512
then I have no moves left.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.296
The more the prosecutor digs,

18:00.340 --> 18:01.602
the guiltier
you'll be, Hermione.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.125
And that's for crimes

18:03.169 --> 18:05.171
that aren't even
on their radar yet.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.478
There's no magic wand
that can make this
just go away.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.263
What if there were one?

18:10.306 --> 18:12.482
And my mother changed
her plea to guilty?

18:12.526 --> 18:13.701
Veronica...

18:13.744 --> 18:16.051
Look, Mom, we've got
to be realistic here.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.142
Why not admit to what
everyone already knows

18:20.186 --> 18:23.319
before something else,
something worse comes out?

18:23.363 --> 18:25.713
Veronica, your mother
would go to prison,

18:25.756 --> 18:27.236
probably for
the rest of her life.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.411
Not if we get someone

18:28.455 --> 18:30.500
with a magic wand
to pardon her.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.502
But that can only happen
at the state level.

18:32.546 --> 18:35.201
So unless you're friends
with Governor Dooley...

18:35.244 --> 18:37.638
I wouldn't say friends exactly,

18:37.681 --> 18:39.988
but we do have a history.

18:41.207 --> 18:42.121
All of us.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.011
[cat yowling]

19:06.667 --> 19:07.798
Hey, are you okay?

19:09.713 --> 19:11.019
What are you doing?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.239
[meowing]

19:14.457 --> 19:15.197
[screams] No!

19:16.285 --> 19:17.373
[gasps]

19:18.809 --> 19:19.810
Caramel.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.251
[knock on door]

19:26.948 --> 19:27.905
[Jughead] Hey.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.299
You free for lunch?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.214
Do you want to go to Pop's
and get a burger?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.390
I got a lot on my mind,
Jug. What's up?

19:34.434 --> 19:36.697
I wanted to ask you
about Grandpa.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.046
Did you know he was a writer?

19:40.048 --> 19:40.831
Yeah.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.486
Where did you hear that?

19:43.530 --> 19:45.358
One of his old classmates
is visiting Stonewall Prep.

19:45.401 --> 19:46.794
Actually I have
a reception later,

19:46.837 --> 19:49.013
if you want to come hang out.

19:49.057 --> 19:51.059
And waste a day
with a bunch of blue bloods

19:51.102 --> 19:52.582
who think they're better
than me? No.

19:52.626 --> 19:54.628
You're the one that pushed me
to go to Stonewall Prep.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.064
Hell, you'd probably make me

19:56.107 --> 19:57.892
put on a tie and a blazer.

19:57.935 --> 20:01.156
And just so you know,
my old man wasn't a writer,

20:01.200 --> 20:03.114
he was a dropout, all right?

20:03.158 --> 20:04.594
He couldn't hold down a job.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.640
He was a mean, mean drunk

20:06.683 --> 20:10.687
who took all of his anger
out on me and on your grandma.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.820
It was the best day of my life
when he skipped out on us.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.300
So do I want to hear about

20:14.343 --> 20:16.693
what a great writer he was
back in high school? No.

20:17.868 --> 20:19.696
[softly] No, I'm...

20:19.740 --> 20:21.872
I'm good with my memories.
But you have fun.

20:29.184 --> 20:30.272
[door closes]

20:33.406 --> 20:35.408
[jazz musician singing]

20:36.496 --> 20:38.193
Governor Dooley! You made it.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.412
Oh, no, not again.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.936
Yes, again.

20:41.979 --> 20:44.547
I have a small favor
to ask you.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.333
I was told this meeting
was requested by the FBI.

20:47.376 --> 20:50.510
No, I'd rather keep
the FBI out of this,
if at all possible.

20:51.511 --> 20:53.295
So, in this folder,

20:53.339 --> 20:54.818
you'll find evidence

20:54.862 --> 20:57.430
that paints a rather corrupt
portrait of you, Governor.

20:57.473 --> 20:59.649
Ordering a bogus quarantine,

20:59.693 --> 21:01.651
accepting drug money
as a bribe,

21:01.695 --> 21:03.784
receiving kickbacks
from my father's jail.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.699
Young lady...

21:05.742 --> 21:08.136
how many times do you think
you can blackmail me?

21:08.179 --> 21:10.356
Help me now
and this will be the last.

21:10.399 --> 21:11.879
And I'll put that in writing.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.750
As you know,
my mother's on trial.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.186
If she pleads guilty,

21:15.230 --> 21:16.797
I need you
to grant her a pardon,

21:16.840 --> 21:17.754
immediately.

21:18.538 --> 21:19.930
In exchange,

21:19.974 --> 21:21.454
I won't release this file
of incriminating evidence.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.892
What do you say, Donald?

21:24.935 --> 21:26.328
Once more for old time's sake?

21:30.593 --> 21:32.726
-[glass clinking]
-May I have your attention?

21:33.727 --> 21:36.033
In literary society tradition,

21:36.077 --> 21:38.340
it wouldn't be a proper reunion

21:38.384 --> 21:41.604
without a little game
of Murder.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.737
[Mr. Chipping] For neophytes,
the rules are as follows.

21:43.780 --> 21:44.825
Everyone draws a card.

21:47.044 --> 21:48.872
Whoever picks "Murderer"

21:49.525 --> 21:51.527
must walk amongst us,

21:51.571 --> 21:53.181
winking at their prey.

21:53.747 --> 21:55.531
If you are winked at,

21:55.575 --> 21:57.577
you die five seconds later.

22:04.235 --> 22:05.585
[Francis] The object
of the game, of course,

22:05.628 --> 22:08.414
is to identify the murderer
before being killed.

22:09.589 --> 22:10.981
Happy hunting, everybody.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.551
[Donna] Enjoying
yourself, Jones?

22:15.595 --> 22:17.553
So this is what one-percenters
do for fun.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.207
They play murder, huh?

22:20.077 --> 22:21.035
Oh, by the way...

22:22.602 --> 22:23.342
Wicked, Jones.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.605
Yeah, go on then.

22:25.648 --> 22:26.693
Yeah, let me die in peace.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.569
[whimpers forcefully]

22:34.701 --> 22:35.876
[all clapping]

22:39.619 --> 22:41.229
[Mr. Chipping]
Down to the wire, boys.

22:45.059 --> 22:46.016
[coughs]

22:46.060 --> 22:47.235
[wheezes and thuds]

22:48.497 --> 22:49.498
It's Jughead!
He's the murderer.

22:49.542 --> 22:51.021
Yeah.
Because I just killed you.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.806
No, I knew it was him
beforehand, I win.

22:52.849 --> 22:55.417
I'm sorry, Bret,
I can't hear you.
Because you're dead.

22:55.461 --> 22:56.679
No, I'm not. I saw...

22:56.723 --> 22:59.421
[Francis] Boy, boys.
Let's be men about this.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.858
It's clear that Jughead Jones
won the game fair and square.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.861
And what a formidable
murderer he was.

23:06.472 --> 23:07.908
[all applauding]

23:14.480 --> 23:16.612
I'm disappointed I didn't
get to meet your father.

23:16.656 --> 23:19.006
Oh, yeah, he's been
busy with work.

23:19.049 --> 23:20.486
Oh, I understand.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.444
Well, I hope
you'll enter the contest

23:22.488 --> 23:23.576
to be our new ghostwriter.

23:23.619 --> 23:25.795
I mean, the grandson
of Forsythe Jones

23:25.839 --> 23:28.929
would be a worthy inheritor
of the mantle.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.539
[Charles] Serial killers
are compulsive.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.454
They leave clues,

23:32.498 --> 23:34.021
take trophies, keep records.

23:34.064 --> 23:34.935
Journals,

23:34.978 --> 23:36.327
diaries,

23:36.980 --> 23:38.634
letters.

23:38.678 --> 23:40.897
They see themselves
as the hero
in their own stories.

23:40.941 --> 23:44.597
Sometimes, it's difficult
for them to distinguish
between reality and fantasy,

23:44.640 --> 23:46.076
fact and fabrication.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.603
By studying childhood diaries
of serial killers,

23:50.646 --> 23:53.519
we can gain invaluable insight
into how their minds work.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.363
[Mary] Your Honor,

24:12.407 --> 24:14.496
in lieu of a closing statement,

24:14.540 --> 24:16.193
my client would like
to say something.

24:16.237 --> 24:17.107
Proceed.

24:21.416 --> 24:22.417
Your Honor,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.072
after careful consideration,

24:25.115 --> 24:26.552
I've decided
to change my plea.

24:26.595 --> 24:29.772
I, Hermione Apollonia Lodge...

24:31.774 --> 24:34.124
plead guilty
to the charges against me.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.517
[all chattering excitedly]

24:44.613 --> 24:46.702
I lied to you, Kevin.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.574
At the hospital,
Dr. Patel told me

24:48.617 --> 24:50.532
that I do have the genes.

24:51.620 --> 24:52.621
And there's more.

24:54.928 --> 24:58.192
Something that I think
I may have repressed.

25:00.803 --> 25:02.544
Do you remember
my cat, Caramel?

25:07.810 --> 25:09.899
A car hit her.

25:09.943 --> 25:12.772
And I found her
on our front lawn.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.425
She was in pain.

25:14.948 --> 25:15.949
Dying.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.387
And it sounded like...

25:20.301 --> 25:22.259
someone screaming. [sighs]

25:22.303 --> 25:26.568
-[yowling]
-So, I went to get
my dad for help.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.309
And he took me back outside.

25:28.614 --> 25:29.963
[meowing]

25:30.006 --> 25:31.747
[Hal] Caramel
is your cat, Betty.

25:32.792 --> 25:34.576
You need to take care of this.

25:35.272 --> 25:36.796
And he handed me a rock.

25:39.320 --> 25:40.582
[meowing]

25:44.325 --> 25:45.413
And he made me...

25:49.635 --> 25:50.679
[Caramel yowls]

25:51.811 --> 25:53.116
[Hal] Good girl, Betty.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.075
Very good girl.

25:55.684 --> 25:57.773
I killed Caramel.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.470
[Kevin] No, Betty.

25:59.514 --> 26:01.472
That wasn't you.
That was your...

26:02.561 --> 26:04.040
deeply screwed-up dad.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.782
Oh, and I'm not screwed up?

26:06.826 --> 26:09.655
I'm repressing memories
of killing animals, Kevin.

26:09.698 --> 26:10.786
[inhales sharply]

26:11.831 --> 26:13.876
Betty, I...

26:13.920 --> 26:15.399
I think this FBI Training thing

26:15.443 --> 26:17.314
might be getting
a little too intense right now.

26:17.358 --> 26:18.489
I think we should...

26:19.708 --> 26:21.797
maybe consider withdrawing.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.759
[Archie] That's it.
Keep your hands up.

26:27.847 --> 26:28.848
Protect your face.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.502
[muttering]

26:31.546 --> 26:32.852
[Munroe] Good job.

26:32.895 --> 26:34.114
[Archie] Keep those hands up.

26:35.855 --> 26:36.856
That's it.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.642
[FP] Red, you got a minute?

26:40.686 --> 26:42.122
Sure. What's up, Mr. Jones?

26:43.689 --> 26:45.429
Some of the local
business owners

26:45.473 --> 26:47.344
have lodged a few complaints
against your center.

26:47.388 --> 26:50.347
Littering, vandalism,
public urination.

26:50.391 --> 26:52.045
[scoffs]

26:52.088 --> 26:54.090
Due respect, Mr. Jones,
that's BS.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.527
I'm here every morning
and I lock up every night.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.877
These kids are not doing
any of that.

26:57.920 --> 26:59.443
Listen, when I rolled
with the Serpents,

26:59.487 --> 27:00.836
we dealt with the same crap.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.230
Wherever we set up,
complaints followed.

27:03.273 --> 27:04.840
Look, no one wants
a gang around.

27:04.884 --> 27:06.581
The problem isn't the kids,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.670
it's the thugs that show up
after we lock up.
They're gnarly.

27:08.714 --> 27:11.586
But this place,
it's supposed to make
the neighborhood better.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.327
Well, show 'em that.

27:13.370 --> 27:14.807
Do what the Serpents
used to do.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.330
Invite some of the yokels over

27:16.373 --> 27:18.158
for a get-to-know-you
clam bake.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.247
People are less likely
to call the cops

27:20.290 --> 27:21.857
if they've had
a conversation with you.

27:22.728 --> 27:23.685
All right?

27:28.995 --> 27:30.474
You think you really pulled
something off

27:30.518 --> 27:31.519
at the reception,
don't you?

27:33.173 --> 27:34.957
Bret, Bret, Bret. [sighs]

27:35.001 --> 27:37.090
Are you really still mad
about that Murder game?

27:40.310 --> 27:41.790
All right.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.400
Look, if it means
that much to you...

27:44.793 --> 27:46.055
Poof!

27:46.099 --> 27:47.927
Consider yourself raised
from the dead, preppy.

27:47.970 --> 27:49.493
"Preppy."

27:49.537 --> 27:50.886
You turn your nose up at us,

27:50.930 --> 27:52.714
you scorn us
for our privilege...

27:53.976 --> 27:55.325
But the only reason
you're here

27:55.369 --> 27:57.066
is because some
school benefactors

27:57.110 --> 27:59.765
thought it would look good
to take on a charity case.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.288
Some dirt-poor scholarship kid.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.681
I'm here because of my writing.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.291
Just get over it.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.509
No, Jughead,

28:05.553 --> 28:07.381
you're not here
because of your talent.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.035
The Admissions Committee?

28:09.078 --> 28:11.167
None of them have read
a single word
you've ever written.

28:11.211 --> 28:12.734
[chuckles] You're a statistic,

28:12.778 --> 28:14.083
a project.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.650
Every year there's one of you.

28:15.694 --> 28:19.610
Some welfare freeloader
who never amounts to anything.

28:19.654 --> 28:20.786
Just like your grandfather.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.309
He couldn't even
make it a semester.

28:22.352 --> 28:25.138
That is your past, present,
and future, Jughead--

28:25.181 --> 28:26.574
[grunting]

28:27.923 --> 28:29.359
[yells] Shut your mouth!

28:29.403 --> 28:31.361
Looks like you've inherited
his temper, too. Huh?

28:33.929 --> 28:35.757
They all know I'm right.

28:35.801 --> 28:37.977
And deep down,
you know it, too.

28:42.068 --> 28:43.504
[breathing heavily]

28:55.646 --> 28:56.952
Most of you know me by now,

28:56.996 --> 28:58.562
but my name is
Archie Andrews.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.173
I run this place
with Munroe Moore.

29:01.087 --> 29:02.871
And we invited you here today

29:02.915 --> 29:04.481
to set the record straight
about a few things.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.440
Starting with...

29:06.483 --> 29:09.269
Despite a few bogus complaints
that have been made,

29:11.053 --> 29:12.489
this community center
is not going anywhere.

29:12.533 --> 29:14.927
In fact, starting today,

29:14.970 --> 29:17.451
we will be expanding
our hours to 11:00 p.m.,

29:17.494 --> 29:19.018
and we'll be open on Sundays.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.977
So, to my neighbors, I say,

29:22.021 --> 29:23.631
instead of working against us,

29:23.674 --> 29:24.806
why don't you come in
and help out?

29:24.850 --> 29:26.503
Sponsor our baseball team.

29:26.547 --> 29:27.983
Donate your time.

29:28.027 --> 29:31.813
These kids need people
to show them that they care.

29:31.857 --> 29:32.988
Which is why we're starting

29:33.032 --> 29:34.250
a Big Brothers and
Big Sisters program.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.210
The Riverdale High Bulldogs
and Vixens

29:37.253 --> 29:39.081
have already volunteered,
so why don't you?

29:39.125 --> 29:40.909
And if you still want
to shut us down,

29:40.953 --> 29:42.650
then go ahead and try.

29:42.693 --> 29:44.391
My mom is a very good lawyer.

29:44.434 --> 29:46.001
Or you can try the cops,

29:46.045 --> 29:47.307
and I'll call
my best friend's dad,

29:47.350 --> 29:48.308
the Sheriff of Riverdale.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.397
Otherwise,

29:50.440 --> 29:52.181
my friendly advice to you

29:52.225 --> 29:53.792
is get out of my way.

29:55.097 --> 29:56.533
[press chattering indistinctly]

29:58.884 --> 30:00.015
[Archie] Can I help you?

30:00.059 --> 30:03.062
Look, I own
a hardware store on Drury,

30:03.105 --> 30:04.846
and I admire what you're
trying to accomplish here.

30:04.890 --> 30:06.674
And I'm not the only one.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.154
So why didn't you
say that, then?

30:08.197 --> 30:12.027
The thing is, many of us
business owners are getting...

30:12.071 --> 30:14.290
pressure to speak out
against your center.

30:14.334 --> 30:15.378
Not by Hiram Lodge?

30:16.902 --> 30:17.946
No. Uh...

30:18.729 --> 30:19.861
His name is Dodger.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.037
And we've been paying him
a protection fee.

30:22.081 --> 30:23.996
Lately, he's added a request.

30:24.039 --> 30:26.085
Protest your center,

30:26.128 --> 30:28.696
or risk losing his protection.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.698
And then maybe
our stores get robbed.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.874
Or burned to the ground.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.615
So, Dodger's the one
who wants us out of here?

30:36.182 --> 30:37.879
Every kid who sets foot
in your place

30:37.923 --> 30:40.882
is one less running scams
for him on the streets.

30:46.975 --> 30:48.281
[FP] Well...

30:49.282 --> 30:51.110
Look what the cat dragged in.

30:51.153 --> 30:52.981
I'm done with Stonewall Prep.

30:53.025 --> 30:54.591
Place is toxic.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.811
I'm going back
to Riverdale High to be
with my friends.

30:56.855 --> 30:57.899
No.

30:57.943 --> 30:59.553
Mmm-mmm.

30:59.596 --> 31:01.468
You're not throwing away
this opportunity.

31:01.511 --> 31:03.165
You're giving me whiplash, Dad.

31:03.209 --> 31:05.080
What opportunity?

31:05.124 --> 31:06.560
So I can be
buried alive in a coffin,

31:06.603 --> 31:07.735
or be told that I'm only there

31:07.778 --> 31:09.432
because I grew up
in a trailer park?

31:10.085 --> 31:11.086
Someone said that to you?

31:11.130 --> 31:12.696
Yeah. Bret did.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.394
Well...

31:14.437 --> 31:16.700
Who cares how you got in?
You're in.

31:16.744 --> 31:19.399
And those silver spoons,
they feel threatened.

31:19.442 --> 31:22.271
This Bret kid, he knows
you're better than him.

31:22.315 --> 31:23.925
That you're gonna
leave him in the dust.

31:23.969 --> 31:25.361
And you'll do it without the...

31:25.405 --> 31:28.147
Without the privilege
or the fancy name.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.365
But if you drop out now...

31:30.976 --> 31:32.064
you're no better
than my old man.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.935
If you hated him so much,

31:33.979 --> 31:36.111
then why would you
name me after him?

31:36.155 --> 31:37.286
It's my name, too,
don't forget.

31:37.330 --> 31:38.940
And yeah, I hate him,

31:38.984 --> 31:40.159
but he's still my old man.

31:40.202 --> 31:41.987
So it's gotta count
for something, huh?

31:45.164 --> 31:46.121
Also, uh... [sighs]

31:49.777 --> 31:51.866
Those books weren't from me.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.043
Your granddad sent them
from wherever the hell he was.

31:56.131 --> 31:57.350
I didn't tell you 'cause...

31:58.568 --> 31:59.569
'Cause I'm still angry

32:00.353 --> 32:01.745
at how he treated us.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.182
He was a hard man,

32:03.225 --> 32:04.966
and there was no love
lost between us,

32:05.010 --> 32:06.141
but I gotta give
the devil his due.

32:06.185 --> 32:07.273
Those books you love...

32:08.796 --> 32:09.884
were from him.

32:12.582 --> 32:13.888
And you have no idea
where he is now?

32:14.149 --> 32:15.759
No.

32:15.803 --> 32:16.978
Do you want me to look for him?

32:17.022 --> 32:19.154
No, I don't.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.243
But I'll tell you
what I do want.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.680
I want you to go back.

32:23.724 --> 32:25.639
I want you to do
what my father never did,

32:25.682 --> 32:26.857
what I never did.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.076
Graduate high school.

32:29.425 --> 32:31.688
Show those preppies

32:31.732 --> 32:33.908
what it means
to be a Jones man.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.954
Bring honor to our name.

32:46.921 --> 32:48.662
[footsteps approaching]

32:48.705 --> 32:50.359
I'm quitting
the program, Charles.

32:50.403 --> 32:51.708
But, Betty, you're a natural.

32:51.752 --> 32:53.145
Yeah, that's the problem.

32:53.188 --> 32:54.842
It's too easy for me.

32:54.885 --> 32:56.887
I could identify
every single killer
in your slideshow...

32:58.193 --> 33:00.021
because I'm like them.

33:02.154 --> 33:03.633
I have the same genes as them.

33:06.767 --> 33:08.682
All the more reason
for you to stay
in the program.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.685
To make sense
of that part of yourself.

33:11.728 --> 33:14.079
You couldn't understand,
Charles, okay?

33:14.122 --> 33:15.950
-You just don't get it.
-I can.

33:16.733 --> 33:17.865
And I do, Betty.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.435
I have the genes, too.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.437
In fact, it's why
I joined the FBI.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.700
To control those impulses.

33:26.743 --> 33:29.659
You have
the serial killer genes?

33:31.270 --> 33:32.314
[softly] Yeah.

33:32.358 --> 33:33.750
You can use this.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.056
Harness this...

33:35.100 --> 33:36.666
to keep the darkness in check.

33:37.580 --> 33:38.581
I did.

33:45.110 --> 33:47.068
[Veronica] Oh,
that's amazing news.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.592
Thank you so much, Governor,
I really appreciate it.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.292
No, that's fine,
I'll pick her up myself.

33:53.335 --> 33:54.510
Bye, now.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.124
Sounds like you just
got some good news.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.082
[chuckles] Yes, I did.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.998
My mother's been away
for a while

34:04.042 --> 34:05.826
and she's finally coming home.

34:06.522 --> 34:07.567
Same as your father.

34:10.178 --> 34:11.353
I'm sorry, do I know you?

34:11.397 --> 34:12.398
No.

34:13.138 --> 34:14.095
You do not.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.490
But I'll tell you
the same thing

34:17.533 --> 34:20.275
I told the federal prosecutor.

34:20.319 --> 34:22.756
That I'm a licensed
private investigator.

34:22.799 --> 34:25.106
That I was hired
by Hiram Lodge

34:25.150 --> 34:27.978
to uncover any malfeasance
against him.

34:28.022 --> 34:31.286
And that I can
unequivocally prove

34:31.330 --> 34:35.116
that the federal prosecutor
colluded with you

34:35.160 --> 34:38.293
to frame and bring
false charges against Hiram.

34:38.337 --> 34:39.512
That's not true.

34:39.555 --> 34:41.253
Yes, it is.

34:41.296 --> 34:47.302
I have many recordings
of you two... plotting.

34:47.346 --> 34:51.306
Including a conversation
you two had

34:51.350 --> 34:52.873
at that booth over there,

34:53.961 --> 34:56.137
discussing Pop Tate's subpoena.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.139
You had my place bugged?

34:58.183 --> 35:00.272
Yes. I did.

35:00.315 --> 35:02.796
So, here's what happens next.

35:02.839 --> 35:05.146
The federal prosecutor
has already told the judge

35:05.190 --> 35:07.322
that she's dropping
the charges against Hiram,

35:07.366 --> 35:08.758
thanks to...

35:09.890 --> 35:11.718
information I provided.

35:11.761 --> 35:12.849
Look.

35:13.894 --> 35:15.548
Whatever Hiram's paying you,

35:16.418 --> 35:17.202
I'll double it.

35:17.245 --> 35:18.638
Nice try.

35:20.422 --> 35:21.902
But that won't work with me.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.819
You see,
our father needed help,

35:26.472 --> 35:28.038
someone he could trust.

35:28.082 --> 35:29.518
So he had me come up
from Miami.

35:29.562 --> 35:30.780
I fix things.

35:32.217 --> 35:33.348
That's what I do.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.220
"Our father"?

35:37.787 --> 35:39.006
I don't understand.

35:39.049 --> 35:40.399
I'm Hiram's other daughter.

35:42.401 --> 35:43.141
Hermosa.

35:45.012 --> 35:45.839
He needed me.

35:47.449 --> 35:48.233
So I came.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.588
[sighs]

36:40.981 --> 36:42.374
"Li'l Forsythe III.

36:42.417 --> 36:43.679
Happy Birthday.

36:43.723 --> 36:45.855
Sorry, I'm not there
to celebrate with you.

36:47.509 --> 36:50.077
Never let anyone tell you
that you don't belong.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.210
Love, Grandpa.

36:54.734 --> 36:57.476
P.S. Trust few,

36:57.519 --> 37:00.218
and never let them take
anything from you."

37:11.490 --> 37:13.231
[indistinct chatter]

37:14.406 --> 37:16.625
Hiram, Hiram,
Alice Smith with RIVW.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.367
Please, tell our viewers,
what are you feeling right now?

37:19.411 --> 37:21.500
Well, I couldn't be happier
with the outcome.

37:21.543 --> 37:24.372
And now that you've been
vindicated of all your crimes,

37:25.330 --> 37:26.505
will you and your...

37:27.810 --> 37:28.898
Daughter.

37:29.464 --> 37:30.552
...be leaving Riverdale?

37:30.596 --> 37:31.901
On the contrary,

37:31.945 --> 37:35.296
I'm excited to fulfill
a lifelong dream of mine

37:35.340 --> 37:38.560
and announce my candidacy
for mayor of Riverdale.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.301
-[reporters clamoring]
-Sir, sir! Over here, sir.

37:47.613 --> 37:49.179
[Kevin] I'm confused.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.357
So we're not bailing on
your hot brother's FBI class?

37:52.400 --> 37:53.793
I thought, based on
what happened to Caramel--

37:53.836 --> 37:56.361
That was before
I got privileged information

37:56.404 --> 37:59.102
that made me realize
that we don't actually know

37:59.146 --> 38:00.713
anything about Charles.

38:00.756 --> 38:02.454
Forget, "Is Charles gay
or straight?"

38:02.497 --> 38:05.500
I'm interested in,
is he a serial killer or not?

38:06.414 --> 38:08.503
I'm serious, Kevin.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.332
The only places
I've ever seen him are Pop's,

38:11.376 --> 38:13.813
my house, and the FBI office.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.510
I mean,
what does he do all day?

38:15.554 --> 38:17.556
Where does he go?
Where does he live?

38:17.599 --> 38:20.472
And, again,
why is he still in Riverdale?

38:20.515 --> 38:22.648
[engine starts]

38:22.691 --> 38:24.519
[Kevin] I thought he was
helping out Jughead's dad
on some cases.

38:24.563 --> 38:25.303
[Betty] What cases?

38:26.869 --> 38:29.481
He's keeping secrets from me,
Kev, I know it.

38:30.525 --> 38:32.527
That's why we have
to stay close to him.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.659
[engine starts]

38:52.330 --> 38:53.592
[Archie] We need to talk.

38:57.639 --> 38:58.988
For too long
you've been preying

38:59.032 --> 39:01.164
on the youth of Riverdale.
That ends now.

39:01.208 --> 39:03.645
It's time for you
to book a one-way
bus ticket out of town.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.473
I've got manpower.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.041
The support of the people.

39:09.564 --> 39:10.478
You...

39:12.088 --> 39:13.394
whoever the hell you are,

39:14.221 --> 39:15.309
don't.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.485
Consider this
a declaration of war.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.966
Leave town,

39:20.009 --> 39:21.663
or the next time we meet,

39:21.707 --> 39:23.273
you won't be driving away.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.536
You won't even be walking.

39:25.363 --> 39:26.407
That's a promise.

39:29.497 --> 39:30.324
[gun cocking]

39:33.806 --> 39:35.155
I'm not going anywhere!

39:37.810 --> 39:39.725
You're a dead man, you hear me?

39:40.595 --> 39:42.031
[yells] You're a dead man!

39:44.382 --> 39:45.774
Mr. Chipping and I
have conferred

39:45.818 --> 39:47.210
and decided on the theme

39:47.254 --> 39:49.474
for our Baxter Brothers
writing competition.

39:49.517 --> 39:50.692
Who's interested?

40:00.398 --> 40:01.399
Jughead?

40:04.053 --> 40:05.272
Oh, no.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.316
I'm in...

40:07.187 --> 40:08.318
and I'm winning.

40:08.362 --> 40:09.885
And please, Mr. Chipping,
from here on,

40:09.929 --> 40:12.148
you can call me
Forsythe, the Third.

40:15.978 --> 40:17.197
It's after my grandfather.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.460
[Francis] Wonderful.

40:19.504 --> 40:22.289
Then you, and your classmates,
will be challenged to devise

40:24.073 --> 40:25.205
the perfect murder.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.381
That's your theme.

40:29.339 --> 40:30.515
Let the bloodbath begin.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.396
Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper,
and Veronica Lodge,

40:42.440 --> 40:43.876
you're under arrest

40:43.919 --> 40:46.574
for the cold-blooded murder
of my son, Jughead Jones.
