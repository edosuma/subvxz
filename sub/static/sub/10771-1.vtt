01:46.538 --> 01:50.625
This is the story of a man
named Hubert.

01:50.835 --> 01:52.586
Hubert Fiorentini.

01:53.212 --> 01:54.964
47 years old.

01:55.422 --> 01:56.966
202 pounds.

01:57.967 --> 02:00.344
6 foot 4.

02:00.845 --> 02:04.514
He's someone
who doesn't hurt a fly.

02:04.723 --> 02:07.684
The thing is, this woman is no fly.

02:14.691 --> 02:17.987
Hubert, you are exaggerating.
- You could have waited.

02:18.278 --> 02:19.696
I can't hear you.

02:23.868 --> 02:26.661
I'll bring you to a quiet place
to talk.

02:41.051 --> 02:44.638
I have to report to Squale. Interrogate him
and don't let him cheat you.

02:47.557 --> 02:50.394
Hello, Hubert.

02:55.274 --> 02:58.527
Mr. Fiorentini. Van Eyck here.

02:58.693 --> 03:01.488
I know you are busy
all day.

03:01.696 --> 03:05.284
That's why I forgive you
all the unanswered messages.

03:05.617 --> 03:08.954
Mr. Van Eyck, I don't have time.
Come to business.

03:09.621 --> 03:12.332
You are in debt.
For the third time this month.

03:12.666 --> 03:16.253
Clear the bills or your
account will be removed.

03:16.461 --> 03:18.713
Understood?
- I'm coming.

03:19.298 --> 03:20.715
No.

03:21.591 --> 03:23.010
I had to come?

03:23.343 --> 03:25.888
Hubert, what's the problem?
Are you nervous?

03:26.221 --> 03:30.350
No, not more than usual.
I'm quite calm.

03:31.143 --> 03:33.771
You can't just beat
up people.

03:33.938 --> 03:37.399
If it's about the woman,
or rather guy...

03:37.732 --> 03:39.193
Forget the transvestite.

03:39.526 --> 03:42.654
I'm talking about the others.
- Others? Which ones?

03:42.988 --> 03:45.615
Hubert, think very good.

03:54.124 --> 03:56.794
Yes there was a young man
disturbing me.

03:57.127 --> 03:59.254
Good. Go on...

04:05.510 --> 04:10.933
It's coming back. There was a fight.
- Yes, anything else?

04:13.435 --> 04:16.021
At the stairs there was a guy
who wanted to tell me something...

04:16.230 --> 04:18.732
but I didn't understand him.

04:19.066 --> 04:21.401
He said...
- My dad is the chief of police.

04:24.529 --> 04:26.531
Ah, it slipped my mind.
- He remembered.

04:26.698 --> 04:29.118
His dad is out of town.
You apologize to the kid.

04:29.451 --> 04:32.079
What should I say?
- Say whatever you want...

04:32.287 --> 04:34.331
That you thought he was a gangster.

04:34.664 --> 04:36.291
But the transvestite is waiting...

04:40.545 --> 04:43.173
Ok, where do I find him?
- What do you think?

04:48.846 --> 04:51.849
Hello there. It's me.
You remember me, right?

04:53.809 --> 04:56.103
I ran into you last night.

04:56.854 --> 04:59.481
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not here to arrest you.

04:59.689 --> 05:01.358
I'm here to...

05:04.569 --> 05:06.530
I came to apologize.

05:06.947 --> 05:10.575
I didn't recognize you in the dark.
I didn't know you were the son of...

05:10.743 --> 05:12.286
Water...

05:13.703 --> 05:16.749
I thought you were a bad guy.

05:16.957 --> 05:20.669
A gangster. Wears the same black suit.

05:22.129 --> 05:26.967
I'm really sorry.
I'll be going now, bye.

05:38.813 --> 05:41.648
Sounds like you are in a good mood today.
Can't you talk?

05:41.982 --> 05:44.526
Listen, Sofia.
I'm really busy with a case right now.

05:44.860 --> 05:48.322
Sure, you're always busy with work.
- Not on Sundays.

05:48.488 --> 05:51.408
True, but then you play a round of golf.
- I have to relax sometime, right?

05:51.575 --> 05:56.080
That's why I'm calling.
After golf we are going out for dinner.

05:56.413 --> 05:59.416
I'm not hungry. See you later.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.710
He's not hungry.

06:03.212 --> 06:04.755
First time I've heard that one.

06:06.841 --> 06:11.261
Nothing. We tried everything.
- Even the worst. He likes everything.

06:11.428 --> 06:13.931
May I?
- Sure, go ahead.

06:14.139 --> 06:16.058
If you got time to kill.

06:31.741 --> 06:33.492
Sigaret.

06:42.918 --> 06:45.379
You really have a way with women.

06:45.545 --> 06:49.466
Comes naturally. Men and women
are meant to get along.

06:50.384 --> 06:52.219
I'm listening. Where are your girlfriends?

06:53.262 --> 06:54.889
Wow, an impressive looking pen.

06:55.890 --> 07:00.269
It was a gift. Only for special
occasions. Now go ahead.

07:01.603 --> 07:03.647
Who did you get it from, a woman?

07:03.814 --> 07:07.234
The only one for me.
She just left one day.

07:09.611 --> 07:11.947
This is all she left behind.

07:14.408 --> 07:16.911
Come on.
Give me the name of the bank.

07:24.084 --> 07:25.878
Banque de I'Etoile.

07:26.545 --> 07:28.422
The whole gang will be there.

07:29.506 --> 07:32.092
It was our last job.
Our grand finale.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.345
When is it?

07:37.807 --> 07:40.309
It's today.
- What time?

07:41.811 --> 07:44.646
You're already 30 minutes too late.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.023
Put it out on the wire.

07:50.903 --> 07:54.990
Everything under control? They're all inside?
Did you check the place?

08:02.122 --> 08:03.623
Oh fuck, not him.

08:03.791 --> 08:09.296
Everything is going alright. No panic. They are
inside and we have contact now and then.

08:09.463 --> 08:11.423
Tell them we are sending someone.

08:12.132 --> 08:14.885
Why?
I didn't ask for anyone.

08:19.681 --> 08:23.769
What is this ladies? Why not just
work like everyone else.

08:23.936 --> 08:25.479
Go home. I'm working here.

08:27.147 --> 08:28.565
Go ahead.

08:31.443 --> 08:36.782
What are you doing? I'm in charge here.
Stay where you are or I'll make a hole in this man's head.

08:36.949 --> 08:41.495
No, you're not shooting anyone.
I'm the only one here who's allowed to do such a thing.

08:41.661 --> 08:47.667
This is all that's left of your girlfriend.
Now give up and surrender.

08:48.293 --> 08:50.670
Irene, my head is spinning.
He's going to hurt us.

08:51.005 --> 08:52.547
Honey, he's not going to do anything.

08:52.757 --> 08:55.885
We have all the dynamite and guns. What
can he do? He's bullshitting.

08:56.218 --> 09:00.430
Oh you have a gun?
From here it looks more like a piercing machine.

09:00.597 --> 09:03.768
Shut up.
Very funny. Now show yours.

09:08.022 --> 09:10.190
Oh my, look at that.
- Wow, that's big enough for a horse.

09:11.984 --> 09:14.904
Gonna hurt really bad.
Give it up guy.

09:15.237 --> 09:17.990
I'd rather not.
You could break your nails.

09:19.033 --> 09:23.203
Don't fool with me. Push it
gently my way.

09:23.370 --> 09:24.789
Okay, but I warned you.

09:32.087 --> 09:35.132
Haha, you saw that girls? How do I look?
Okay, game's over.

09:35.465 --> 09:39.887
I'll count to ten. Very slow.
We'll keep it at your level.

09:40.220 --> 09:43.390
What are you going to do,
I got your piece right here.

09:44.058 --> 09:46.726
1, 2...

09:47.061 --> 09:49.521
Stop fucking around. I'll blow us all up.
-3...

09:50.439 --> 09:51.857
and 10.

10:16.256 --> 10:19.009
Why did I expect to be left alone today.

10:24.681 --> 10:27.267
Hubert, Hubert...
- It's Sunday.

10:27.434 --> 10:31.563
Sure, but for us every day is Monday.
I just saw the police chief.

10:31.772 --> 10:35.275
Why did you rub salt in the wounds
instead of apologizing?

10:35.442 --> 10:37.319
All I did was pour him a glass of water.

10:37.486 --> 10:43.408
Thanks to you he has to stay at the hospital.
His old man questioned your methods.

10:43.575 --> 10:45.035
I don't know what you are talking about.

10:45.202 --> 10:47.662
Thanks to you the kid is in suspended
position for 2 months.

10:47.872 --> 10:51.291
The chief wants the same
for you.

11:04.471 --> 11:05.890
I see.

11:07.599 --> 11:10.227
Hubert, no-one can question your results,
but your methods...

11:13.773 --> 11:16.400
What's wrong with my methods?
- They are illegal.

11:18.903 --> 11:22.406
We're not in the far west.
There are laws and codes to apply to.

11:22.572 --> 11:24.909
And as a police officer you have to respect
those 2 things.

11:25.075 --> 11:29.872
Respecting those rules made me lose eight
guys 2 years ago. I bring them flowers very often.

11:30.039 --> 11:33.000
The dead don't live among us.
Accept reality.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.837
You don't have any friends, no wife,
no kids.

11:37.004 --> 11:40.925
Get a life.
Go start a family.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.635
It will do you good.

11:43.969 --> 11:47.681
Try it. You got a problem with women?

11:47.848 --> 11:49.391
Of course not, but...

11:49.724 --> 11:51.852
Have you been dating with anybody?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.149
I loved someone, but that was long ago...

11:57.316 --> 11:59.318
Come on everybody has heard that story.

11:59.484 --> 12:02.905
You met a woman while you were
on a job in Japan. One day she just left.

12:03.072 --> 12:05.449
But fifteen years have gone by.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.743
Nineteen years.
- Okay, nineteen.

12:07.910 --> 12:10.830
You should go try something new.
You can't spend your whole life crying about her.

12:11.038 --> 12:14.499
Do me a favor.
Use these 2 months to relax.

12:15.125 --> 12:17.377
Go shopping.
- I don't like shopping.

12:17.711 --> 12:21.799
Force yourself.
Buy yourself some new stuff for fun.

12:22.007 --> 12:27.179
With a nice Armani shirt you
won't be single for long.

12:27.346 --> 12:31.266
You're suspending me?
- No, I am saving you.

12:31.433 --> 12:35.813
Go be a man a while and
proof you're not just a cop.

12:40.525 --> 12:43.738
Don't you want to come in?
- Of course.

12:43.904 --> 12:46.991
I have never seen you
wear something like that before.

12:47.199 --> 12:51.411
All my T-shirts were dirty.
- Oh, I understand.

12:56.125 --> 12:59.795
What's wrong?
- Nothing, I was going to take your coat.

13:05.009 --> 13:07.762
What's that lovely smell?
- The food.

13:07.970 --> 13:10.430
No, I think it's you...

13:12.057 --> 13:15.602
You're wearing cologne?
- Yes, I found an old bottle.

13:15.936 --> 13:19.356
The bottle I gave you 2 years ago?
- Really?

13:19.523 --> 13:21.358
Yes.

13:34.413 --> 13:38.292
So now you're hungry.
- Can't live on bread alone.

13:39.459 --> 13:42.797
I'm out of champagne,
but I have some Shochu. Is that alright?

13:42.963 --> 13:44.381
Yeah.

13:56.393 --> 13:58.520
Everything alright at work?

13:59.396 --> 14:02.942
What's so funny?
- I don't work anymore.

14:03.108 --> 14:05.861
I stopped when my husband passed away.
5 years ago.

14:08.238 --> 14:12.409
How about a spring roll?
- That would be just great.

14:22.502 --> 14:23.963
Thanks.

14:27.716 --> 14:30.052
That was just perfect, Hubert.

14:30.219 --> 14:32.346
Thanks. It was no big deal.

14:32.512 --> 14:35.224
First dinner in 2 years.

14:35.850 --> 14:38.352
Time sure flies, huh?
- Yeah.

14:38.560 --> 14:41.856
Who taught you to cook like this, your ex?
- Right.

14:42.147 --> 14:47.319
I thought you only spent eight months with her.
- Believe me, you can learn a lot in eight months.

14:48.653 --> 14:50.364
I believe you.

14:51.949 --> 14:54.076
Will you call me a taxi?
- Right now?

14:54.243 --> 14:59.331
Why do you look so surprised?
- I thought...

14:59.539 --> 15:04.544
Now that we know each other a bit better,
I thought you might want to stay here tonight.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.422
I think I'll walk. It's nice weather.

15:07.589 --> 15:11.093
A perfect ending
to a perfect evening.

15:17.224 --> 15:18.642
Sofia, I don't understand.

15:18.809 --> 15:22.604
You're very cute when you try so hard.
But you don't trust women.

15:22.772 --> 15:26.025
It's not easy with women.
They leave me or break my heart.

15:26.191 --> 15:29.319
I don't want to do either, Hubert.

15:29.528 --> 15:33.490
All I want is to spend some time together.
That's love.

15:33.657 --> 15:36.285
Not crying over someone who has
been gone for over twenty years.

15:36.451 --> 15:39.288
Nineteen years.
- Nineteen years if you prefer.

15:39.496 --> 15:44.584
If she really loved you she would still be here.
And you would have had beautiful children.

15:45.502 --> 15:49.548
But she is gone and all she left were
a few memories and recipes.

15:52.760 --> 15:55.387
Call me when your heart is free again.

15:55.720 --> 15:57.848
I don't know how to cook.

15:58.057 --> 16:01.476
But I do know how to please a man.
Our kids would be beautiful.

16:02.686 --> 16:06.481
You really look burned out.
You should take a vacation.

16:49.817 --> 16:53.570
I think it's time we separated.

17:18.012 --> 17:21.265
Mr. Fiorentini?
Paris police department?

17:21.431 --> 17:22.850
Yes that's me.

17:23.017 --> 17:26.395
Do you know a woman named
Miko Kobayashi?

17:26.686 --> 17:28.773
Yes I know her.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.319
You know where she is?
- Yes, at the morgue.

17:35.738 --> 17:38.866
Ms. Kobayashi passed away
yesterday in Tokyo.

17:39.074 --> 17:41.410
Sorry to give you such sad news.

17:43.703 --> 17:48.667
I am Mr. Hishibashi, lawyer. Tomorrow
I will read her last wishes and will.

17:48.834 --> 17:53.338
You are the only one mentioned.
I'd like you to be present.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.550
She put me in her will?
Yes she did.

17:56.716 --> 18:00.304
Finding you wasn't easy.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.432
Tomorrow at three ok?
- I'm in Paris.

18:03.766 --> 18:07.895
There is a flight at 5 'clock
and one at 8.30.

18:08.103 --> 18:13.358
I made a reservation for both.
There is a ticket waiting for you.

18:13.567 --> 18:20.199
I can't just leave, I need to talk to my employer first.
- I already did. Mr. Squale, isn't it?

18:20.407 --> 18:24.745
He said you could go.
He told me you could stay as long as you want.

18:24.912 --> 18:28.373
I'll think it over, alright?
- Ok, but you have to hurry.

18:28.540 --> 18:31.418
What does it matter, why rush it?

18:31.585 --> 18:34.254
She will be cremated tomorrow.

18:34.421 --> 18:39.093
Don't you want to see her
one last time?

18:39.259 --> 18:40.719
I'll be there.

19:25.222 --> 19:28.642
Business or pleasure?
- Neither one.

19:39.194 --> 19:41.405
Where do you come from?

19:41.571 --> 19:46.118
The airplane.
- Your humor tells me you are french.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.955
Sorry?
- Where did your plane come from?

19:50.122 --> 19:55.377
If you look up you will see
only one plane arrived. From Paris.

19:55.585 --> 20:01.550
And if you look down you will see a ticket
with CDG on it. Charles de Gaulle, Paris.

20:01.884 --> 20:06.055
See I'm not only funny,
but also very observant.

20:08.098 --> 20:13.145
You will see I'm also very observant.
Open your luggage.

20:15.605 --> 20:20.569
Make it quick. I'm late.
- Hey, why hurry...

20:27.785 --> 20:29.703
Where is he?
- There, in room 17.

20:29.912 --> 20:32.957
I hope he's still in one piece.
- We're not savages.

20:33.123 --> 20:37.878
I haven't seen him in 15 years.
Wouldn't recognize him.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.303
Hang on one second.

20:46.470 --> 20:52.434
I am nervous. Like a virgin.
How do I look?

20:52.601 --> 20:54.436
Do I look presentable?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.626
Momo?

21:17.793 --> 21:19.544
You recognize me?

21:19.711 --> 21:21.630
How wonderful, Hubert.

21:25.592 --> 21:27.052
Let me look at you.

21:27.219 --> 21:31.015
You look good man, just arrived
and already in deep shit.

21:31.181 --> 21:34.018
Try to be a little more discreet
until we get out of here.

21:34.351 --> 21:37.187
You're right, we're gone.
It's ok, he's one of ours.

21:37.354 --> 21:40.024
When I was a rookie, he was
already a lieutenant.

21:40.190 --> 21:43.693
We were here in the 80's to
watch the Russians.

21:43.861 --> 21:46.030
I can't tell you the trouble we made.

21:46.196 --> 21:50.450
That's right you can't, now try to
keep your mouth shut for 5 minutes.

21:50.617 --> 21:53.746
I'm sorry for this. But your employee
didn't show me any respect.

21:53.913 --> 21:58.167
I taught him a lesson and I was a bit
out of line. Please except my apologies.

21:58.333 --> 22:02.963
You do have a reputation, Mr. Fiorentini.
Why are you here in Tokyo?

22:03.297 --> 22:05.966
Working?
- Vacation. But don't worry, I won't be long.

22:06.133 --> 22:08.302
That's right. With him nothing takes long.

22:08.510 --> 22:10.429
Respect.

22:20.105 --> 22:21.690
Fifteen years...

22:35.370 --> 22:36.789
You're still driving the same car.

22:37.122 --> 22:40.459
I love this car.
Never change a winning team.

22:40.625 --> 22:44.046
So what are you up to?
- Nothing really. I'm all done with the commando's.

22:44.254 --> 22:47.174
I'm just your average neighborhood cop.

22:47.341 --> 22:50.385
I finish my shift and go home.
- Quit fucking me around.

22:50.552 --> 22:54.974
Tell me you are knitting while you're at it.
- I play golf. And I love it.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.893
You poor thing.
It's a good thing you came back.

22:58.268 --> 23:02.773
So what do we blow up? Gonna sink a bot?
Sabotage a power plant?

23:02.940 --> 23:04.358
Do you remember that one time?

23:04.524 --> 23:08.612
We blew up the wrong building.
It was totally great.

23:09.279 --> 23:11.115
I'm here for a personal matter.

23:17.204 --> 23:21.041
You haven't heard of that little Japanese lately?
What was her name?

23:21.208 --> 23:22.626
Miko.

23:22.793 --> 23:27.339
Miko. She had you on a leash
like a dog.

23:27.672 --> 23:29.674
She passed away yesterday.

23:29.884 --> 23:34.429
I'm here for her cremation.
- I had no idea, sorry.

23:34.596 --> 23:36.807
I know.
How did you know I was coming?

23:36.974 --> 23:40.978
Well I still work with the intelligence.
Can I drop you off?

23:41.145 --> 23:42.562
Here's the address.

23:43.147 --> 23:47.151
Shinjuku. The red light district.
They got the best looking hookers in town.

23:48.652 --> 23:50.195
Of course that's not why you're here.

24:28.943 --> 24:30.652
Over there.

24:44.624 --> 24:47.461
Mister Hishibashi?

24:59.389 --> 25:01.976
Mr. Fiorentini, I assume.
- That's right.

25:02.142 --> 25:07.606
You look just like on the picture
Miko made 20 years ago.

25:07.773 --> 25:13.487
Nineteen.
- That's absolutely right. Sit down please.

25:15.364 --> 25:18.408
Miss Kobayashi named you as
her sole legatee.

25:18.617 --> 25:24.999
For practical reasons
everything is in this box.

25:26.458 --> 25:30.755
If you'd be so kind to sign
for acceptance.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.585
You were quite poetic.

26:11.586 --> 26:14.882
Personally I prefer the picture
of you in your uniform.

26:20.805 --> 26:24.892
Where it all began
and all shall end.

26:26.977 --> 26:29.814
Did she express any last wishes she
wanted me to carry out.

26:30.147 --> 26:32.107
Only one.

26:32.316 --> 26:35.569
That you will be the guardian of her
daughter until she becomes of age.

26:37.780 --> 26:40.115
Her daughter?
- Yes, that's right.

26:40.324 --> 26:44.078
How old is she?
- Nineteen and about 11 months.

26:44.244 --> 26:46.288
So her mother...

26:46.663 --> 26:50.459
So I...
So her mother...

26:50.960 --> 26:53.212
But how... what... what...

26:53.545 --> 26:55.756
You mean what's her name?
- Yes.

26:56.090 --> 26:58.968
Her name is Yumi. You will like her.

26:59.384 --> 27:02.763
Hang on. Where are you going?

27:02.930 --> 27:05.265
I was going to introduce her.

27:05.432 --> 27:06.851
You mean the daughter is here...

27:07.017 --> 27:10.229
Yes, in the other room. I got
her out of prison this morning.

27:10.395 --> 27:13.733
Prison?
- Don't worry. Nothing big.

27:13.899 --> 27:17.111
She was upset because
of the death of her mother.

27:17.277 --> 27:20.447
She drank too much and then
punched down a few police men.

27:20.614 --> 27:24.118
Police men?
- Yes, but I'll let her tell you about it.

27:24.326 --> 27:26.703
No, wait a second.

27:26.871 --> 27:31.125
You tell me I have a daughter of 19
that just got out of prison.

27:31.333 --> 27:36.255
I adapt to new situations pretty fast,
but I need some time here.

27:40.550 --> 27:45.305
How do you know she's my daughter?
- Because on the birth certificate...

27:45.472 --> 27:48.350
it says your name at 'father'.

27:48.517 --> 27:51.020
It says the same in the will...

27:51.186 --> 27:53.814
and it also says you were the only
man in her life.

27:53.981 --> 27:57.276
Why did she leave me then?
- She said nothing about that.

28:01.155 --> 28:06.701
Does she know I'm her father?
- No, I assumed you wanted the pleasure to tell her.

28:06.911 --> 28:11.373
Pleasure. I come back from Paris, after 19 years.
Hello, I'm your father.

28:11.540 --> 28:15.335
She just lost her mother.
Now she'll have a father.

28:15.502 --> 28:19.464
Maybe there was another man after me,
and is he the father.

28:19.631 --> 28:21.425
Who could remember?

28:21.591 --> 28:24.719
You could do a DNA-test.
that way you'll be sure.

28:24.929 --> 28:29.474
But from what I've seen,
I'm sure she's your daughter.

28:35.731 --> 28:38.358
She's right behind the door?
- Yes.

28:44.114 --> 28:47.617
Let's keep this for ourselves.

28:47.827 --> 28:49.453
Alright.

28:52.206 --> 28:55.167
Because I don't want to traumatize her.

29:01.006 --> 29:04.301
They are fragile at that age.
- I agree.

29:04.509 --> 29:07.888
Even if they pretend they're not.
- Very true.

29:08.055 --> 29:10.099
So, are you going to open the door?

29:34.414 --> 29:38.002
What did she say?
- She asked you who you are.

29:38.168 --> 29:43.298
Just tell her I'm a good friend of her
mother.

29:55.102 --> 29:59.356
So what's the name of this goofball.
- Just call me: Hubert from France.

29:59.523 --> 30:02.692
Mr. Fiorentini, she speaks French.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.406
Hello, I am Hubert.

30:11.035 --> 30:14.163
Yumi. Be polite or
you'll go back to the police.

30:14.371 --> 30:17.750
They can go to hell. I hate them.

30:19.459 --> 30:22.004
Do you have something to drink?

30:22.171 --> 30:23.881
Sake?
- Yeah great.

30:46.195 --> 30:48.155
Thanks, I feel better.

30:57.832 --> 31:01.418
Why didn't my mother tell me
about you?

31:01.585 --> 31:04.338
You speak French.
Maybe she had French friends.

31:04.504 --> 31:09.343
She worked at the French embassy.
- Me too. That's where I met her.

31:11.011 --> 31:12.471
Why are you here?

31:12.637 --> 31:16.141
Because your mother
wanted him...

31:16.308 --> 31:19.561
to take care of you until
you are of age.

31:19.729 --> 31:23.983
Which is in...
- Two days. I won't make it much longer.

31:24.149 --> 31:27.694
Yumi, that's not the way to speak to your...

31:27.862 --> 31:29.363
your guardian.

31:31.741 --> 31:33.826
It is your mothers last request.

31:34.034 --> 31:37.704
The fact that she chose him...

31:37.872 --> 31:42.292
means that she must have thought
very highly of him.

31:42.459 --> 31:48.173
If your mother trusted him,
you can do the same.

31:52.052 --> 31:54.805
For at least two days.

32:05.607 --> 32:08.736
Come on, let's go see her.

32:18.788 --> 32:22.624
We can walk there. It's only a few blocks.
- Don't you want to take a taxi?

32:22.833 --> 32:25.961
I am very fragile right now.
You have to be nice.

32:26.128 --> 32:27.629
Okay.

32:28.923 --> 32:30.465
Oh man, he doesn't waste any minute.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.760
Can I ask you a question?

32:32.968 --> 32:36.555
No, I'll ask the questions.
For two days.

32:36.764 --> 32:38.598
Oh. Ok.

32:47.441 --> 32:50.903
You still have it.
Five minutes and you got yourself a girl.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.363
That's Miko's daughter.
So mine too apparently.

32:53.572 --> 32:55.490
She's sexy
- What?

32:55.699 --> 32:58.410
I just didn't know
you had such a sexy daughter.

32:58.618 --> 33:02.206
Me neither.
Follow from a distance and shut up.

33:02.706 --> 33:04.959
Damn, this is about to get messy.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.966
Mama.

33:12.341 --> 33:14.969
Your friend from Paris is here.

33:35.740 --> 33:38.868
Hello Miko. It's good to see you again.

33:42.454 --> 33:46.416
Even in the worst cases she
still smiles.

33:51.171 --> 33:52.840
You have the same smile as your mother.

33:59.471 --> 34:03.642
Has it been long since you last saw her?
- Nineteen years.

34:07.772 --> 34:09.940
I'll leave you alone.

34:10.149 --> 34:13.110
It's been long, so you
must have a lot to say.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.497
Why did you keep it secret? Why?

34:30.920 --> 34:34.089
You wanted me to take care of her,
and I will.

34:34.464 --> 34:36.759
Because she's all that remains of you.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.561
Wait.

35:04.619 --> 35:09.208
What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just a professional habit.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.128
Are you a doctor?
- Yes that's right, a doctor.

35:13.337 --> 35:15.923
Do you know how she died?
- Yes, cancer.

35:16.090 --> 35:20.845
Do you have her medical file?
- Yes, at home.

35:21.053 --> 35:25.307
What's your specialization?
- Plastic surgery.

35:25.515 --> 35:28.602
Ah that's great.
You can give me advice.

35:28.811 --> 35:31.688
I want a better nose.
Look. I have a very big nose.

35:32.022 --> 35:37.694
It's not good for a young girl like me.
- I think your nose is very pretty.

35:37.862 --> 35:40.697
It's horrible.
I bet I got it from my father, the bastard.

35:40.865 --> 35:44.576
A bastard? I mean...
Do you know him?

35:44.910 --> 35:49.874
No. Lucky for him,
otherwise he'd be dead.

35:50.750 --> 35:55.712
What did he do wrong?
- He seduced my mother and raped her.

35:56.046 --> 35:57.714
No?
- Yes.

35:58.257 --> 36:02.094
It's true. Tomorrow I will become
of age and do whatever I want.

36:02.302 --> 36:05.347
I will get the whole country
to pay him back.

36:05.514 --> 36:07.892
I think I better sit down.

36:12.562 --> 36:16.191
You want some more sake?
- No, the chair is fine.

37:36.188 --> 37:40.484
Yumi, this is Maurice, or Momo.
- A friend from Tokyo.

37:42.694 --> 37:45.280
The resemblance is amazing.

37:45.489 --> 37:47.449
With your mother.
- Do you know her?

37:47.616 --> 37:50.285
Never met her, no.
- Let's go.

38:04.341 --> 38:08.178
Does she know you are a cop?
- No, if I tell her she will run away.

38:08.387 --> 38:10.890
I already lost her mother,
I would like to keep the daughter.

38:11.098 --> 38:15.685
She will understand. Whatever you do,
she will accept it because you're her father.

38:15.895 --> 38:17.646
She doesn't know I'm her father.

38:17.855 --> 38:20.232
Otherwise I'd be dead already.
- Nice.

38:23.110 --> 38:25.029
Does she know Miko is her mother?

38:25.237 --> 38:29.033
Sometimes you really are an idiot.
Of course she knows.

38:31.994 --> 38:35.372
Your story is so complicated.
No wonder I mix it all up.

38:51.931 --> 38:55.642
This is my mothers big sister.
- Oh my God.

39:01.899 --> 39:03.483
What did she say?

39:03.650 --> 39:07.487
She said she saw your ugly face
before, but doesn't know where.

39:07.654 --> 39:10.365
Good. I mean, that's ok.

39:10.532 --> 39:13.535
Her medical file?
- It's somewhere over there.

39:15.495 --> 39:18.207
Momo, wait for me in the car.
- Are you sure?

39:18.415 --> 39:20.250
Can I take a piss?
- No.

39:20.751 --> 39:23.003
I don't think I can hold it in.

39:32.512 --> 39:37.810
Nice room.
- I want something else on the wall.

39:38.685 --> 39:41.731
Sure why not? Something with animals.

39:42.064 --> 39:44.942
Sure, why not rabbits?

39:45.275 --> 39:49.989
No, no. I was thinking about
a picture of a nuclear cloud.

39:50.322 --> 39:55.119
With people around it,
dancing on techno.

39:56.453 --> 39:59.790
Sure, why not?
What's your mothers bedroom like?

39:59.957 --> 40:04.628
She lived in the city.
She came here in the weekends.

40:04.962 --> 40:08.007
Do you like music?
- Yes, absolutely.

40:21.353 --> 40:23.647
Well, maybe later...

40:23.981 --> 40:26.191
The file?
- Yeah.

40:31.155 --> 40:33.908
Ok, here it is.
- Right, thanks.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.410
What was her profession?

40:36.576 --> 40:40.873
I don't know.
Mama always was sort of mysterious.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.250
You can say that.

40:45.210 --> 40:49.799
What are you looking for?
- Nothing. Just routine.

40:52.802 --> 40:56.638
If you want these two days
to go right...

40:56.847 --> 41:00.810
you will have to quit
treating me like an idiot.

41:00.976 --> 41:05.605
You found a sample of crystal
at her nose and dirt under her nails.

41:05.940 --> 41:09.276
Look, there are strange
things in here.

41:09.484 --> 41:14.489
And as a doctor, you
need evidence.

41:14.656 --> 41:18.577
You mean like the police.
- Exactly.

41:19.954 --> 41:24.750
I will let them do some tests and when
I get the results, you will be the first to know.

41:24.917 --> 41:28.503
Agreed?
- Agreed.

41:30.547 --> 41:34.051
You are pretty clever, huh?
- Yes I try.

41:34.384 --> 41:37.805
Would you like to help me
track down my father?

41:38.013 --> 41:42.101
You just lost your mother. Don't you
want to wait before you kill your father?

41:42.434 --> 41:45.896
What's the difference,
he must be far away from here.

41:46.063 --> 41:50.109
Who said he raped your mother?

41:50.609 --> 41:53.738
My mother.
- She's got a lot of nerve... I mean, that's serious.

41:58.575 --> 42:02.412
Do you really think your mother
would just let someone rape her?

42:04.999 --> 42:07.417
Why would she lie?

42:07.584 --> 42:11.088
To protect you,
or to protect him.

42:11.421 --> 42:14.800
Why would she
protect such a mean guy?

42:15.009 --> 42:17.136
Maybe he's not that bad.

42:29.356 --> 42:33.819
Let's buy your ugly wallpaper.
- Right now.

42:49.251 --> 42:51.503
Give me your phone number
and have this analyzed.

42:51.711 --> 42:54.423
What is it?
- The analyze will say that.

42:54.631 --> 42:57.592
Ok, you will have it tomorrow,
- You have an hour.

42:58.343 --> 43:00.179
Good to have him back.

43:01.889 --> 43:04.349
I will transfer some money to your account.

43:04.516 --> 43:07.102
Are you rich?
- No, but the bank loves me.

43:07.269 --> 43:10.355
I will transfer money every week.

43:10.522 --> 43:14.318
That's funny, my mother did the same.
- Yes, funny.

43:14.484 --> 43:18.989
Every Friday she would give me 200
dollars, and in two days I spent it all.

43:19.156 --> 43:23.618
Judging by the will, there can't
be much on the account.

43:23.786 --> 43:25.788
Hello, lady Yoshimido.

43:25.955 --> 43:29.792
Would you tell him I need a balance
and then I will say how much to transfer.

43:30.000 --> 43:32.878
I speak French.
- Good.

43:36.256 --> 43:37.716
What's that?

43:37.925 --> 43:40.720
An electronic signature.

43:53.023 --> 43:56.318
Here you are.
- Thank you.

44:04.159 --> 44:08.247
How much is the yen worth?
- It's a dollar amount.

44:15.212 --> 44:18.465
Could you check it again?
There must be a mistake.

44:18.632 --> 44:21.802
Of course, I understand your surprise.

44:21.969 --> 44:26.140
This is the main account.
The interest is on a separate account.

44:26.306 --> 44:28.683
Should I get it for you?

44:30.685 --> 44:32.146
Sure, why not?

44:42.031 --> 44:43.573
Also in dollars?

44:43.741 --> 44:51.916
Should I print out a total?
- No, that's ok. I get the picture.

44:55.585 --> 44:57.712
Well? Is there enough?

45:00.257 --> 45:04.804
Yeah you are doing ok.
- How much would you like to transfer?

45:04.970 --> 45:06.513
What amount.

45:09.183 --> 45:11.518
Two thousand.
- Dollars?

45:11.685 --> 45:13.103
Franc.

45:15.647 --> 45:19.359
Thanks, Hubert.
I will never forget this.

45:19.526 --> 45:22.112
Oh it's nothing.
- It's great.

45:22.279 --> 45:23.906
You are like a real father.

45:24.073 --> 45:28.660
I think your father... Your real father
would have done the same.

45:28.828 --> 45:34.166
Yes, but he's not here.
And I am lucky to have you around.

45:34.333 --> 45:35.835
Signature?

45:38.754 --> 45:42.382
And now we are going shopping.
- Well be reasonable.

45:42.549 --> 45:47.429
I never spend more than I have.
- That's a good principle.

46:26.969 --> 46:28.971
200 million dollars.

46:30.765 --> 46:33.142
Pretty, huh?
- Very pretty.

46:45.029 --> 46:47.489
Could I use your phone for a second?

46:50.450 --> 46:52.995
Momo, do you have the results yet?

46:53.162 --> 46:56.456
For the crystals we know,
but not for the dirt.

46:56.623 --> 46:59.293
Iron, mercury, calcium... or rather...

46:59.459 --> 47:02.797
Cyanide. Can you cure liver
cancer with cyanide?

47:02.963 --> 47:06.926
I don't think so. But you are the doctor.
- As a cop what's your opinion?

47:07.092 --> 47:10.262
Cyanide under the nose,
a fake medical file...

47:10.429 --> 47:13.432
traces that lead to a fight.
What do you think?

47:13.598 --> 47:18.312
That she was murdered and the killers
didn't expect Hubert Fiorentini.

47:18.478 --> 47:20.773
We'll go to alarm phase one.

47:20.940 --> 47:23.275
Meet me at Hotel Imperial and
reserve a suite there.

47:23.442 --> 47:27.279
What equipment?
- Bring everything you can find.

47:27.446 --> 47:29.531
Oh my God, it's like my birthday.

47:33.035 --> 47:35.454
What's wrong?
- Nothing. But you've had enough fun now.

47:35.620 --> 47:38.916
How about trying a few sweaters?

47:39.083 --> 47:41.085
Here we go.

47:54.890 --> 47:57.727
I'm warning you.
We're going to do every floor.

50:08.023 --> 50:14.654
Fiorentini, Hubert. We have a reservation.
- That's right. Welcome to the Imperial.

50:14.822 --> 50:16.406
Thanks.

50:16.573 --> 50:22.788
I'm sorry to be indelicate, but is the
young woman of legal age?

50:22.955 --> 50:25.374
She's my daughter.

50:25.540 --> 50:28.627
Daddy.

50:28.794 --> 50:30.963
My apologies..

50:41.681 --> 50:43.893
Put all that in the other room.

50:58.032 --> 50:59.449
Thank you.

51:02.286 --> 51:05.915
Very good, about the daughter.
- I didn't have a choice.

51:12.212 --> 51:17.134
Still not smart, because we
don't even look like each other.

51:18.302 --> 51:22.139
Except for the nose,
maybe a little.

51:33.734 --> 51:36.403
You want orange juice?
- No, thank you.

51:39.073 --> 51:40.699
How about sake?

51:43.577 --> 51:47.581
Maybe later.
Don't you want to try the new clothes?

51:47.748 --> 51:51.085
Should I show them?
- Yeah, that's fine.

51:51.752 --> 51:54.046
guess who went shopping.

51:54.839 --> 51:58.592
I got all your favorite stuff.
You will like it.

52:02.387 --> 52:05.557
Bazooka, with heat seeker.

52:05.766 --> 52:08.728
weighs only a pound.
So I got two of them.

52:08.894 --> 52:10.813
Pressed air, mini missiles.

52:10.980 --> 52:15.567
Can destroy two city blocks,
knock out an army. Very efficient.

52:28.455 --> 52:32.251
You know for sure she's your daughter?
- Why?

52:32.417 --> 52:35.545
She doesn't look like you.
- Momo.

52:35.712 --> 52:38.924
Except for the nose. Let's go on.

52:39.091 --> 52:42.803
Anti-personnel bazooka, made in Korea.
It can stop a tank.

52:42.970 --> 52:49.226
You got something I can use in town?
- I have something small for that, very light.

52:49.393 --> 52:52.687
This is a classic. A 357 Magnum.

52:52.855 --> 52:55.983
The latest Uzi.
50 rounds per second.

52:56.150 --> 52:59.444
And from Russia with love,
you can use mustard gas with that.

53:19.882 --> 53:24.594
From Argentina, something to
use from a distance, and some grenades.

53:24.762 --> 53:27.389
I'll take this one.

53:27.556 --> 53:30.559
I knew it.
You don't want some grenades?

53:30.726 --> 53:35.731
No, maybe later. I have to stay discreet.
I don't want to scare her.

53:36.982 --> 53:39.651
Do you know what's going on?
- No I don't know much yet.

53:39.819 --> 53:42.279
The woman I love disappears
just like that...

53:42.446 --> 53:46.366
and about 19 years later she's dead. She
leaves me a daughter and 200 million dollars.

53:46.533 --> 53:50.245
200 million dollars?
- That's what's on the bank account.

53:50.412 --> 53:54.624
But at the rate she spends it
it won't last very long.

53:54.792 --> 53:57.878
200 million dollars.

53:58.045 --> 54:00.965
Yes and a bunch of idiots with sunglasses
are following us since we left the bank.

54:01.131 --> 54:05.344
I think they want the money.
- I get it. 200 million dollars.

54:05.510 --> 54:07.637
And there where it all began
it shall end.

54:07.805 --> 54:12.893
I'm not in her will for nothing.
I think she needed help.

54:13.102 --> 54:15.062
Someone or something
must have stopped her.

54:15.229 --> 54:19.108
She left me certain clues.
- Yes and 200 million dollars.

54:19.274 --> 54:23.403
Stop talking about that.
It's not for you. Forget it.

54:23.570 --> 54:26.406
Would you be able to get Miko's file?

54:26.573 --> 54:29.451
Yes I think so.
I know a guy for that.

54:29.618 --> 54:32.830
We will have to look into her past
to understand it.

54:34.915 --> 54:37.584
I'm ready.
- Ready for what?

54:37.752 --> 54:42.589
I'm going out tonight.
- Not like that. It's freezing at night.

54:42.798 --> 54:46.176
You have to wear a jacket.
- Yes a yellow one.

54:46.343 --> 54:50.055
I'm not going fishing. I'm going to dance.

54:50.222 --> 54:53.642
And it's always hot when I dance,
just like my mother.

54:53.809 --> 54:55.560
That's right.

54:55.728 --> 54:59.023
Aren't you afraid at night?
The streets are dangerous.

54:59.189 --> 55:02.192
No. A rape at every corner.
- What?

55:02.359 --> 55:07.990
Not every night.
- If I have to die, I'll do it partying.

55:08.532 --> 55:12.286
And if you are afraid, why not come with me.

55:12.452 --> 55:16.290
You can play daddy.

55:16.456 --> 55:18.375
I know you like that.

55:20.085 --> 55:21.754
Bring the grenades.

56:01.043 --> 56:03.587
Video games in a nightclub?

56:13.055 --> 56:15.808
This is uncle Hubert and uncle Maurice.

56:49.216 --> 56:51.343
Come on everyone on the dance floor.

57:32.301 --> 57:36.638
I'm too old for that.
And my knees are hurting.

57:36.806 --> 57:39.266
Come on. Do it for me please.

58:02.873 --> 58:04.959
Cross your knees.

58:14.969 --> 58:18.013
Very good for a beginner.
I'm proud of you.

58:18.180 --> 58:19.639
Hey Momo, it's your turn.

58:19.807 --> 58:22.727
Everything hurts on me.

58:26.981 --> 58:29.566
Oh okay, just one time.

59:04.434 --> 59:07.062
What did he say?
- He wants to challenge you...

59:07.229 --> 59:10.274
in a game where you don't use
your knees.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.067
Where is it?
- Over there.

59:12.234 --> 59:13.861
Ok let's go.

59:15.780 --> 59:19.449
I was winning.
What's going on?

59:19.616 --> 59:21.535
I'll explain later.

59:26.456 --> 59:29.251
No, go ahead.
I'll watch how you do it first.

1:00:28.811 --> 1:00:32.231
Don't panic. Don't move.

1:00:39.196 --> 1:00:42.783
If you don't mind,
we will play the rematch another time.

1:00:42.950 --> 1:00:45.828
Is there another exit?
- In the back.

1:00:52.709 --> 1:00:54.128
I am sure glad he's back..

1:01:01.510 --> 1:01:04.764
I'm sorry,
I didn't want to ruin your evening.

1:01:09.143 --> 1:01:11.937
Who are you?
- I'm not a doctor.

1:01:12.104 --> 1:01:15.775
Thanks.
I found that out myself.

1:01:17.401 --> 1:01:20.738
Who are you to
kill people like that?

1:01:20.905 --> 1:01:26.660
Besides, who were those men?
And why did they carry guns?

1:01:41.258 --> 1:01:44.887
Do you understand?
- No, but it doesn't matter. Calm down.

1:01:45.054 --> 1:01:47.681
I'll explain everything.

1:01:47.848 --> 1:01:49.558
Dry your tears.

1:01:52.895 --> 1:01:55.689
Now she reminds me of someone.

1:01:55.856 --> 1:01:58.150
Go look for Miko's file...

1:01:58.317 --> 1:02:01.028
and call the lab for the dirt
under her nails.

1:02:01.236 --> 1:02:04.740
In an hour at the Hotel.
- Come on I spend my life in the car.

1:02:31.976 --> 1:02:35.896
Your mother asked for me.
She didn't trust anyone else.

1:02:36.105 --> 1:02:38.983
Even after all these years,
I think she trusted me.

1:02:39.149 --> 1:02:43.070
She let me come here to tell me
something. A secret.

1:02:43.237 --> 1:02:47.950
But someone killed her before
she could tell me.

1:02:48.117 --> 1:02:51.746
Now the guys in the black suits
are after you.

1:02:51.912 --> 1:02:55.833
I didn't do anything.
Why do they want me?

1:02:58.502 --> 1:03:00.462
That's what I've been wondering.

1:03:01.546 --> 1:03:04.591
You told me she lived in
town during the week?

1:03:06.385 --> 1:03:10.305
Two years ago
she took me there.

1:03:10.472 --> 1:03:14.727
She forgot something important.

1:03:14.894 --> 1:03:18.522
We went there,
but I stayed outside.

1:03:18.731 --> 1:03:21.441
She wouldn't let me inside.

1:03:22.985 --> 1:03:27.907
And when I said I wanted to
see where she lived...

1:03:28.073 --> 1:03:30.367
she hit me in my face.

1:03:38.793 --> 1:03:41.378
That's the only time she ever hit me.

1:03:49.136 --> 1:03:50.679
Do you remember the address?

1:04:17.832 --> 1:04:20.625
Has she always been like this?

1:04:20.793 --> 1:04:26.256
She was pretty organized, but not like this.
- Then someone has been here already.

1:04:28.508 --> 1:04:33.013
Why is all the furniture gone?
- They were looking for something...

1:04:34.223 --> 1:04:36.934
but they don't know your mother.

1:04:37.101 --> 1:04:41.897
'Never place an object in another
object you can move. '

1:04:44.817 --> 1:04:47.694
What are you talking about.
- You will see.

1:04:53.826 --> 1:04:58.038
I still don't get it.
How did you know it was there?

1:04:58.205 --> 1:05:02.835
We had the same education.
Tell me, what is this?

1:05:07.631 --> 1:05:12.845
Numbers and names.
- Now it's starting to become clear.

1:05:13.012 --> 1:05:14.972
And less clear for me.

1:05:15.139 --> 1:05:17.432
My mother sent some
guy to look over me...

1:05:17.599 --> 1:05:20.394
that kills everyone
and makes holes in the wall.

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:24.231
Yumi, look. Trust me.

1:05:24.398 --> 1:05:27.484
The nightmare is almost over.

1:05:27.651 --> 1:05:30.237
Alright, let's go home.

1:05:35.617 --> 1:05:38.788
This time they left the furniture behind.

1:05:46.128 --> 1:05:51.425
What were they looking for?
- Probably nothing. Just intimidation.

1:05:52.885 --> 1:05:57.639
They will probably contact us soon.
- What will we do? Should we leave?

1:05:57.807 --> 1:06:00.309
No, we sit down and wait.

1:06:02.602 --> 1:06:05.856
Well they didn't make any 'holles'.

1:06:06.648 --> 1:06:08.275
Holles.

1:06:08.442 --> 1:06:10.652
Holes.
- Holles

1:06:11.320 --> 1:06:13.739
No, with a short L.

1:06:17.159 --> 1:06:19.161
Like in 'hold'.

1:06:23.457 --> 1:06:25.835
And then 'es', like in 'blames'.

1:06:29.922 --> 1:06:31.381
Very good.

1:06:33.968 --> 1:06:35.677
Take a deep breath.

1:06:41.809 --> 1:06:44.353
Welcome in Japan.
- Thanks.

1:06:44.519 --> 1:06:46.521
My name is Kazuhiro Takanawa.

1:06:46.688 --> 1:06:49.775
It will probably mean nothing to you.
- Nothing at all.

1:06:49.942 --> 1:06:53.821
I would like to meet you,
Mr. Fiorentini.

1:06:53.988 --> 1:06:55.405
With pleasure.

1:06:55.572 --> 1:07:00.077
I heard you like to play golf.
- I find it very relaxing.

1:07:00.244 --> 1:07:03.288
So do I.
Let's play a round together.

1:07:03.497 --> 1:07:07.209
My men are waiting downstairs.
- That's fine.

1:07:08.127 --> 1:07:09.544
Holes.

1:07:09.712 --> 1:07:12.089
That's better.
- What's going on?

1:07:12.256 --> 1:07:15.550
I've been invited for a round of golf.
- You're going to play golf now?

1:07:15.718 --> 1:07:20.848
Golfing helps with thinking.
Besides, in golf you have... holes.

1:07:23.183 --> 1:07:24.684
Forget it..

1:07:26.645 --> 1:07:28.939
Could you have the room made up for us?
- Right away sir.

1:07:37.948 --> 1:07:40.492
Clean out your ears. I got everything.

1:07:40.826 --> 1:07:43.412
Momo, they are waiting for us at the door.

1:07:46.916 --> 1:07:51.045
I saw it. I have the file and
and all the results.

1:07:51.378 --> 1:07:52.880
Here, and don't lose it.

1:07:53.213 --> 1:07:56.717
Follow us from a distance.
If there is any trouble, cover us.

1:08:21.742 --> 1:08:23.285
Oh come on. Not now.

1:09:26.932 --> 1:09:29.643
That position is totally wrong.

1:09:35.065 --> 1:09:38.944
And those legs... Like a duck.
We're not at the beach.

1:09:43.532 --> 1:09:45.409
At least keep your eyes on the ball.

1:09:46.911 --> 1:09:49.914
Go play with your Playstation.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:52.666
You won't lose any balls with that.

1:09:54.877 --> 1:09:58.505
You play very well, I've heard.
- At least I don't miss.

1:10:02.802 --> 1:10:06.471
So good that you're dangerous.
- Don't exaggerate.

1:10:08.682 --> 1:10:10.935
Give me a demonstration.

1:10:20.277 --> 1:10:24.073
Why come back to Japan
after all these years.

1:10:24.239 --> 1:10:28.327
Not enough bad memories?
- After a few years only the good remain.

1:10:28.493 --> 1:10:31.789
Aren't you here to make trouble?

1:10:33.082 --> 1:10:38.378
I don't know what you're talking about.
- About the 200 million dollars...

1:10:38.545 --> 1:10:41.131
on your daughters account.

1:10:42.758 --> 1:10:44.176
Daddy?

1:10:48.222 --> 1:10:52.226
Bastard, dirty liar. I hate you.
- Yumi, calm down.

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:57.732
I hate you.
- Calm down.

1:10:57.898 --> 1:11:01.151
I tried to tell you,
but you hated your father so much.

1:11:01.318 --> 1:11:04.029
Bastard. You left us.

1:11:04.196 --> 1:11:08.868
No. Your mother disappeared,
without telling anything.

1:11:09.034 --> 1:11:12.246
And no one ever told me,
that you existed.

1:11:12.412 --> 1:11:15.415
If I would have known
that I had such a great daughter...

1:11:15.582 --> 1:11:18.668
I would come back and looked
for you everywhere.

1:11:18.836 --> 1:11:21.130
And this would have never happened.

1:11:32.224 --> 1:11:34.018
My beautiful daughter.

1:11:35.895 --> 1:11:40.775
Very touching. But before you
fall into each others arms...

1:11:40.941 --> 1:11:42.777
I want my money back.

1:11:42.943 --> 1:11:48.783
That won't happen. The account
is blocked until she is twenty.

1:11:50.034 --> 1:11:53.412
Then we will have to wait nine hours.

1:11:53.578 --> 1:11:59.919
At 10 o'clock the bank will be open and your
daughter will be twenty. Congratulations.

1:12:02.337 --> 1:12:03.881
Bring the girl away.

1:12:13.390 --> 1:12:15.642
Kill him.

1:12:15.810 --> 1:12:17.728
Slowly.

1:12:29.656 --> 1:12:31.450
Wait.

1:12:40.375 --> 1:12:44.421
This one is tough,
but if you do it right...

1:12:44.588 --> 1:12:46.423
it's lethal.

1:13:32.803 --> 1:13:35.848
Don't move. French army!

1:13:37.516 --> 1:13:39.852
Damn it.

1:13:40.019 --> 1:13:41.561
Hubert, everything alright?

1:13:41.729 --> 1:13:46.316
Forget it. They are already down.
You're only a few seconds too late.

1:13:46.483 --> 1:13:48.027
Oh man.
- What?

1:13:48.193 --> 1:13:49.862
The grenade...
- What's with it?

1:13:50.070 --> 1:13:52.406
I took the pin out.

1:13:56.410 --> 1:14:00.664
Hell of a grenade.
- No, those were the grenades in the car.

1:14:00.831 --> 1:14:02.249
What did you find out?

1:14:03.042 --> 1:14:06.253
Miko left the department 19 years
ago because she was pregnant.

1:14:06.420 --> 1:14:08.130
Her file is missing.

1:14:08.297 --> 1:14:13.302
At that moment the department of
Defense opens a new file, top secret.

1:14:13.468 --> 1:14:16.680
I couldn't get my hands on it, however...

1:14:16.847 --> 1:14:18.265
I got pictures.

1:14:20.017 --> 1:14:23.020
Didn't you take the wrong file?
These are wedding pictures.

1:14:23.187 --> 1:14:27.399
The groom is the son of one of
the biggest gangsters in the north.

1:14:27.566 --> 1:14:33.405
Takanawa, the Zebra, because...
- He has a scar all over his face.

1:14:33.572 --> 1:14:35.532
Do you know him?
- I played golf with him.

1:14:35.699 --> 1:14:38.577
Go on.
- Fifth on the left.

1:14:39.870 --> 1:14:42.790
Miko?
- Amongst all the gangsters in town.

1:14:42.957 --> 1:14:46.126
She was so honest, what is this...
- Wait, there is more.

1:14:46.293 --> 1:14:47.837
Miko was with the mafia.

1:14:48.003 --> 1:14:54.760
Still not two months ago she got
a medal from the minister.

1:14:54.927 --> 1:14:57.637
Working undercover.

1:14:57.805 --> 1:15:02.768
She infiltrated the Yakuza
to get them from the inside.

1:15:02.935 --> 1:15:06.480
But to do that she
had to break up with her past.

1:15:06.646 --> 1:15:09.566
She left me to serve her country.

1:15:11.318 --> 1:15:14.113
You would have done the
same in her shoes.

1:15:14.279 --> 1:15:15.990
Yes maybe.

1:15:22.913 --> 1:15:27.793
The rest is simple. She did good
work, until they discovered.

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.130
So she transferred money from
the Zebra to another account...

1:15:31.296 --> 1:15:33.632
and left me some clues.

1:15:33.799 --> 1:15:35.968
Be careful. That's very spicy.

1:15:36.135 --> 1:15:39.847
Still I think there is something missing.

1:15:41.181 --> 1:15:42.892
What's that?

1:15:43.058 --> 1:15:45.102
I don't know.

1:15:45.269 --> 1:15:47.354
Why didn't she say
I have a daughter?

1:15:47.521 --> 1:15:50.733
I don't know. Maybe she didn't
want to involve you.

1:15:50.900 --> 1:15:55.780
And when she saw she couldn't
protect her anymore, you had to do it.

1:15:55.946 --> 1:15:59.616
Protect her? From herself.
She knows her daughter.

1:15:59.784 --> 1:16:03.328
If I wasn't there she would spend
the 200 million dollar very fast.

1:16:03.495 --> 1:16:07.124
Tell me, what's this?
- Wasabi.

1:16:08.083 --> 1:16:09.710
Really good.

1:16:09.877 --> 1:16:12.171
Really, delicious.

1:16:36.153 --> 1:16:39.239
The dirt under her nails,
where did it come from?

1:16:56.256 --> 1:16:58.342
Kyoto.

1:16:58.508 --> 1:17:01.887
Of course.
That's where I declared my love to Miko.

1:17:02.054 --> 1:17:05.599
That's where it all began
and all shall end. Let's go.

1:17:19.822 --> 1:17:23.408
Hurry. We have to be back in
Tokyo before 10.

1:18:12.541 --> 1:18:17.379
My dear Hubert. I sacrificed myself
for my country, and I regret it.

1:18:17.546 --> 1:18:21.967
All these years I wanted to be with you,
even though you weren't away.

1:18:22.134 --> 1:18:26.972
Because you never left me. You remained
in my heart and you always will.

1:18:27.139 --> 1:18:31.435
Take good care of our daughter. She is
great, but she spends too much money.

1:18:31.601 --> 1:18:34.646
Here is the number so you can keep
an eye on her account.

1:18:34.814 --> 1:18:39.609
There should be enough money
for you and our daughter.

1:18:39.777 --> 1:18:41.695
It isn't much compensation of course...

1:18:41.862 --> 1:18:45.699
but I hope that our daughter will
make all those bad memories go away.

1:18:45.866 --> 1:18:48.535
Because only the good memories
remain, right?

1:18:48.702 --> 1:18:51.663
Yours forever, Miko.

1:19:07.179 --> 1:19:08.931
Are there still any of the old guys?

1:19:09.098 --> 1:19:12.935
There are still a few alive.
- We will need them.

1:19:37.667 --> 1:19:39.544
Captain Yasumoto, please.

1:19:48.137 --> 1:19:51.265
Oh hello. Deposit or withdrawal.

1:19:51.431 --> 1:19:53.726
Withdrawal.
- Cash or transfer?

1:19:53.893 --> 1:19:55.394
Transfer.

1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:57.312
It's very simple.

1:19:57.479 --> 1:20:02.777
Left the account where the money is
and right where it has to go.

1:20:03.986 --> 1:20:05.654
You can handle that?

1:20:07.239 --> 1:20:09.658
Fill in... left.

1:20:17.041 --> 1:20:21.086
Lausanne... That's Swiss, isn't it?
- That's right.

1:20:21.253 --> 1:20:24.339
Great.
- Hurry up, we don't have much time.

1:20:24.506 --> 1:20:25.925
Of course sir, right away.

1:20:39.563 --> 1:20:41.023
All done.

1:20:41.190 --> 1:20:43.818
Now, how much do you want to transfer?
- Everything.

1:20:43.984 --> 1:20:47.612
Both accounts?
- Right, both accounts.

1:20:47.780 --> 1:20:50.115
You can buy a lot of hookers
for that.

1:20:50.282 --> 1:20:54.036
Buy what?
- I mean, you can have a lot of fun with that.

1:20:54.203 --> 1:20:57.247
200 million dollars. It's a fair amount.

1:20:58.665 --> 1:21:00.334
Here.

1:21:00.500 --> 1:21:03.337
You are 20 I hope?
- Yes, since this morning.

1:21:04.504 --> 1:21:07.341
Excellent. She may sign.

1:21:17.977 --> 1:21:19.394
Sign.

1:21:24.483 --> 1:21:25.901
Sign it.

1:21:28.362 --> 1:21:29.905
That's it. Finished.

1:21:30.072 --> 1:21:32.324
Congratulations, Yumi.
- Enough.

1:21:32.491 --> 1:21:35.369
Now give me my receipt.

1:21:35.535 --> 1:21:37.329
That's what I'm for.

1:21:39.039 --> 1:21:41.291
Talk to him for a receipt.

1:21:46.797 --> 1:21:48.673
I'd think twice about that.

1:22:01.645 --> 1:22:06.066
If your friend doesn't put down his gun,
you won't get out here alive.

1:22:06.233 --> 1:22:09.403
You are the one who won't get out alive.

1:22:17.912 --> 1:22:20.873
You win, Mr. Fiorentini. Very good.

1:22:21.040 --> 1:22:26.336
And to be a winner, you have to
lose something. Name your prize.

1:22:26.503 --> 1:22:28.130
I don't think you can't do anything
right now.

1:22:28.297 --> 1:22:31.675
The 200 million dollars
are in my account.

1:22:32.467 --> 1:22:34.636
Say good bye to your 200 million dollars.

1:22:37.139 --> 1:22:38.933
Yumi, it's alright, come here.

1:23:20.975 --> 1:23:26.063
You saw what I can do with golf.
Think about what I can do with a .45.

1:23:26.230 --> 1:23:28.065
Tell your men put down their weapons.

1:24:16.155 --> 1:24:18.073
It's over.

1:24:25.790 --> 1:24:27.249
Come on.

1:24:36.133 --> 1:24:37.676
Wait for me.

1:24:46.685 --> 1:24:48.187
I don't believe it.

1:24:48.353 --> 1:24:51.690
Takanawa, the Zebra? Does that ring a bell?
- Of course.

1:24:51.857 --> 1:24:55.444
He's inside on the floor.
They wanted to rob the bank.

1:24:55.610 --> 1:24:57.947
I sorted them.

1:24:58.113 --> 1:25:02.492
When is your vacation over?
Then we can clean up the country.

1:25:05.370 --> 1:25:08.082
Go ahead, it's all messed up.

1:25:17.216 --> 1:25:20.720
Mr. Fiorentini isn't in debt anymore.
- That's about time.

1:25:24.639 --> 1:25:27.476
200 million euros?

1:25:44.451 --> 1:25:46.954
Thanks for the police escort.
But we don't need protection.

1:25:47.121 --> 1:25:50.708
Well it's not for your protection.
It's for everyone around you.

1:25:52.626 --> 1:25:54.586
Thanks for coming, it was nice to see you.

1:25:54.754 --> 1:25:58.465
Now it's your turn to visit.
- If it will be as much fun, gladly.

1:26:00.342 --> 1:26:02.762
What's that?
- Wasabi.

1:26:02.928 --> 1:26:05.055
You said it tasted you good, so...

1:26:05.222 --> 1:26:09.268
Maybe you'd like to try it for breakfast...
- Very nice of you, thanks.

1:26:09.434 --> 1:26:12.938
Take good care of her.
- You can count on me.

1:26:26.493 --> 1:26:30.748
I have to say good bye to the father
I just met?

1:26:30.915 --> 1:26:33.834
First you want me dead
and now I have to stay.

1:26:34.001 --> 1:26:36.253
That's how teenagers are.

1:26:36.461 --> 1:26:40.465
Crying very often and changing
their mind all the time.

1:26:43.218 --> 1:26:45.721
I also have a present for you.

1:26:47.306 --> 1:26:50.100
I didn't really go shopping, but...

1:26:56.148 --> 1:27:00.069
It was your mothers. I kept it for 20 years.
Now I want you to have it.

1:27:06.241 --> 1:27:09.328
One month. Don't worry, just one month.

1:27:09.494 --> 1:27:13.540
You will finish school and I will search
that wallpaper for you and that's it.

1:27:14.249 --> 1:27:17.586
It will be the longest month of my life.

1:27:23.675 --> 1:27:25.928
For me too, Yumi.

1:28:10.555 --> 1:28:13.642
No problem sir. Go ahead. Have a good trip.
- Thank you.

1:28:25.362 --> 1:28:27.614
French newspaper sir? Champagne?

1:28:27.782 --> 1:28:30.951
No, thank you.
I'd like to relax until I'm in Paris.

1:28:31.118 --> 1:28:32.661
No problem, sir.

1:28:33.704 --> 1:28:36.040
Attention everyone, please.

1:28:36.206 --> 1:28:38.292
Who do these belong to?

1:28:38.458 --> 1:28:40.085
Oh, no.
