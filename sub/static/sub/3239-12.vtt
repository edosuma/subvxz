41:11.640 --> 41:13.141
HOW DARE YOU!

41:13.141 --> 41:16.264
I BEGGED YOUR FATHER TO GO
TO THE F.B.I., AND HE REFUSED.

41:16.264 --> 41:18.647
THE ONLY WAY TO APPEASE MALCOLM

TO SAVE YOUR FATHER!

IT WOULD ESCALATE.

THAT YOU WERE AMANDA CLARKE.
 OH, SAVE YOUR BREATH.

YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT TO RUN.

41:29.608 --> 41:30.949
FROM YOU? [ LAUGHS ]

WHAT YOU'VE DONE,

I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO STOP HIM.
