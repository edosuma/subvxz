WEBVTT

00:19.853 --> 00:21.687
(Marge groaning)

00:23.823 --> 00:24.990
D'oh!

00:24.992 --> 00:26.358
(tires screeching)

00:26.360 --> 00:28.193
(grunts)

00:29.696 --> 00:32.097
(sizzling, popping)

00:34.300 --> 00:35.701
(groans)

00:45.378 --> 00:46.812
Excuse me?

00:46.814 --> 00:48.047
I'm having trouble

00:48.049 --> 00:49.681
with the on-off button
on my phone.

00:49.683 --> 00:52.151
Okay, let me check your
settings, your photos.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.319
I don't see why
you need to do that.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.221
Wow, that guy's
really fat.

00:56.223 --> 00:58.824
That's my husband! Oh!

00:58.826 --> 01:00.526
Let me talk
to another salesman.

01:00.528 --> 01:01.827
Oh, I'm not a salesman.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.829
I'm just a guy
in a blue shirt.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.831
Oh!

01:05.833 --> 01:07.499
Okay, Maggie, from now on,

01:07.501 --> 01:10.169
we only talk to people at stores
with name tags.

01:10.171 --> 01:13.338
I've said it before,
but this time, I mean it.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.340
(tires screech)
(gasps) What happened?

01:15.342 --> 01:17.509
Oh, someone snuck into
the construction site,

01:17.511 --> 01:21.146
stole a bulldozer and went
joyriding all over town.

01:25.518 --> 01:27.886
(cat meows)

01:27.888 --> 01:31.256
Don't worry.
I have a suspect. Ha!

01:31.258 --> 01:33.092
(gasps)

01:33.094 --> 01:36.061
I can't stand
to see anything suffer.

01:36.063 --> 01:39.198
Now I've got everything I need
to convict your boy,

01:39.200 --> 01:42.034
except for motive,
means and opportunity.

01:42.036 --> 01:43.602
You also have
no evidence.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.104
That's implied!

01:45.106 --> 01:46.939
So, I'm remanding him...

01:46.941 --> 01:48.273
Is that a word-- "remanding"?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.209
Yeah, uh, to your custody.

01:50.211 --> 01:53.712
Maybe a mother can find out
what a police chief can't.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.447
(phone chimes)
Hmm?

01:55.449 --> 01:56.782
What?

01:58.384 --> 01:59.751
Oh!

01:59.753 --> 02:01.720
Let's go.

02:01.722 --> 02:04.389
Monarch butterfly, earwig,

02:04.391 --> 02:06.558
roly-poly, doodlebug,

02:06.560 --> 02:10.095
beer cap, ant,
beer bottle, Barney.

02:10.097 --> 02:11.897
All right, I'm on a list!

02:11.899 --> 02:13.899
(dog barking)

02:13.901 --> 02:16.802
(gasps)
Flanders got a new dog!

02:16.804 --> 02:19.371
(barking)

02:21.241 --> 02:23.075
Aw, what's her name?

02:23.077 --> 02:25.944
Mahershalalhasbaz.
We just call her Baz.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.946
Now it's time for her Christian
doggy training.

02:27.948 --> 02:29.581
This will be interesting.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.416
Sit. Kneel.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.919
Pray. Play dead.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.954
Now resurrect.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.690
And sit in glory at the
right hand of Todd.

02:40.126 --> 02:43.162
Finally, a religion
that makes sense.

02:43.164 --> 02:46.098
All right, Mr. Smarty,
what went on back there?

02:46.100 --> 02:48.934
Mom, why is it
the only time you call me smart

02:48.936 --> 02:50.335
is when you're
being sarcastic?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.104
Really? Do I do that?

02:52.106 --> 02:53.939
Because I really
shouldn't.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.475
You're the one in
trouble here, bub!

02:56.477 --> 02:58.844
Why don't you think
about what you just did?

02:58.846 --> 03:01.180
Why don't you think about
what <i>you</i> just did?

03:08.521 --> 03:11.823
Hmm. I will live
with that forever,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.625
but this is about you.

03:13.627 --> 03:16.862
I swear to you on my mother's
grave, I didn't do a thing!

03:16.864 --> 03:18.764
Sorry, sorry.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.136
So, the Flanderses got
a new dog, and it knows my name!

03:24.138 --> 03:27.172
Good for you,
little girl!

03:27.174 --> 03:28.507
Marge, Bart, I've noticed

03:28.509 --> 03:30.976
neither of you have said
a word all meal.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.812
Are there feelings
going unexpressed here?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.681
Because if there are...

03:35.683 --> 03:39.751
I believe someone at this table
isn't telling us the truth.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.955
Master Bart Simpson!

03:47.727 --> 03:49.661
Kids, could you
excuse us for a moment?

03:49.663 --> 03:53.365
Your mother and I need
to have an adult conversation.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.167
What'd he do?
What'd he do? (laughs)

03:55.169 --> 03:56.501
Your son stole
a bulldozer.

03:56.503 --> 03:59.004
How do you know?
A mother knows.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.173
Does a wife know things?
Yes.

04:01.175 --> 04:02.507
(shrieks)

04:02.509 --> 04:04.376
I believe
we were talking about Bart.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.745
I'm afraid I don't know
how to handle him anymore.

04:06.747 --> 04:10.015
Oh, Bart's ten.
He's too old to be <i>handled.</i>

04:10.017 --> 04:13.685
We should just think of excuses
for when he goes bonkers.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.020
Oh. "Acne medicine."

04:15.022 --> 04:16.922
When in doubt,
blame the acne medicine.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.390
No, I'm not giving
up on Bart,

04:18.392 --> 04:20.525
just like I didn't
give up on our marriage

04:20.527 --> 04:23.428
when you quit your job to start
the North American Sumo League.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.697
The NASL
would have made money

04:25.699 --> 04:29.701
if <i>someone</i> had washed
a few sumo loincloths for me!

04:29.703 --> 04:33.805
I said I would do yours,
but not the whole dojo.

04:36.576 --> 04:39.911
Bart, get in here!

04:39.913 --> 04:42.214
Look me in the
eye and tell me

04:42.216 --> 04:44.950
you know nothing
about that bulldozer.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.219
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

04:47.221 --> 04:48.754
MARGE:
<i>This is bad.</i>

04:48.756 --> 04:50.922
<i>He can't tell his mother</i>
<i>what he does.</i>

04:50.924 --> 04:53.225
<i>Where will that lead?</i>

04:53.227 --> 04:55.227
(with Irish accent):
Any last words, boyo?

04:55.229 --> 04:56.628
I know nothing
about that bulldozer.

04:56.630 --> 04:59.064
Give him the juice!
(electricity crackling)

04:59.066 --> 05:00.299
(laughs)

05:00.301 --> 05:01.900
Which one's yours?

05:01.902 --> 05:03.435
The one being
electrocuted!

05:03.437 --> 05:06.038
I've never seen
an eyeball pop so fast.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.741
I wish I could tell you
about that bulldozer,

05:09.743 --> 05:12.744
but how can I explain something
I know nothing about?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.446
I am not cable news.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.415
Stop it! Stop it!

05:16.417 --> 05:18.083
Stop lying right now!

05:18.085 --> 05:19.918
But-but you have
to believe me.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.586
You're my mom!

05:21.588 --> 05:24.456
All right, I will
believe you on this.
Smart.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.592
But until then, I'm going
to keep my eye on you.

05:27.594 --> 05:28.960
All the time.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.262
All the time?

05:30.264 --> 05:32.864
How are you gonna
change Maggie?

05:38.104 --> 05:40.505
Ah, close enough.

05:41.474 --> 05:44.009
OTTO:
All aboard.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.944
Mom, what
are you doing?

05:45.946 --> 05:49.281
I told you, to trust you,
I have to watch you.

05:49.283 --> 05:52.017
All the time.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.320
Mmm.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.855
You're gonna be
riding this bus?

05:56.857 --> 06:00.625
I'm going to be watching my son
wherever he goes.

06:00.627 --> 06:01.993
Then you'd better
go out the back,

06:01.995 --> 06:03.528
'cause that's where he went.

06:04.297 --> 06:05.897
D'oh!

06:10.303 --> 06:12.537
(barking)

06:14.140 --> 06:17.509
Oh, you must be
Flanders' new dog.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.378
I just want to
apologize in advance

06:19.380 --> 06:21.646
for the things I'm
gonna blame on you.

06:21.648 --> 06:22.981
Homer, meet Baz.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.050
(barking)
(laughing)

06:28.488 --> 06:30.155
Oh, sorry, Flanders.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.656
I'm sure she has
fun with you.

06:31.658 --> 06:33.825
(laughs)
She sure likes you.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.161
Must be the cheeseburgers
in your sweat.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.997
Cheeseburgers in my sweat.
Really?

06:38.999 --> 06:43.568
Now, apparently, I have
<i>cheeseburgers</i> in my sweat.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.341
I can leave
any time, Bart.

06:49.343 --> 06:52.043
Just tell me what happened
with that bulldozer.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.079
Next question.
Fine.

06:54.081 --> 06:56.081
Which papers
on the walls are yours?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.749
None of them.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.185
Is that the boy
who copies off you?

07:00.187 --> 07:02.020
<i>I</i> copy off <i>him?!</i>

07:02.022 --> 07:07.192
What brand of poppycock is this
miscreant feeding you, madam?

07:07.194 --> 07:09.027
Okay, Mom,
I admit it.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.696
There's a few lies I told you
that you're gonna find out.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.865
Simpson, you said
your mother was dead.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.534
(groans)

07:15.536 --> 07:18.036
She's become
a zombie! Run!

07:18.038 --> 07:20.105
(humming)

07:23.209 --> 07:25.877
Mom, churros are
good for you.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.379
They're ethnic.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.281
Hey, Simpson,
you need your mommy

07:29.283 --> 07:31.216
to cut your carrots
for you?

07:31.218 --> 07:33.051
He can cut his
own carrots.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.720
Baby carrots
'cause he's a baby!

07:35.722 --> 07:38.256
(laughter)

07:38.258 --> 07:39.257
Brilliant!

07:39.259 --> 07:40.792
Mom, Dad does plenty of stuff

07:40.794 --> 07:42.127
you don't like.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.562
Why don't you follow him?

07:43.564 --> 07:44.896
Following an
adult is creepy.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.566
Following your
kid is parenting.

07:47.568 --> 07:51.102
I'm so lucky my mom's
in Gainesboro, Florida...

07:51.104 --> 07:52.804
I think.

07:54.073 --> 07:55.740
Is my mom still outside?

07:55.742 --> 07:59.444
She's swinging on a swing,
and Ralph's pushing her.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.446
RALPH:
Hello! Good-bye!

08:01.448 --> 08:03.281
Hello!
Good-bye!

08:03.283 --> 08:04.950
Hello! Good-bye!

08:04.952 --> 08:07.152
Hello!
Good-bye!

08:07.154 --> 08:08.753
Hello! Good-bye!

08:08.755 --> 08:11.957
I am never leaving this tube.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.759
Sorry, lad. You've been in
more than five minutes,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.428
so I've got to remove you.

08:16.430 --> 08:20.432
And I'm authorized to use the
greatest weapon at me disposal.

08:20.434 --> 08:23.268
(playing "Highland March")

08:23.270 --> 08:24.936
No!

08:24.938 --> 08:27.506
Scotland! 1,200 years,

08:27.508 --> 08:29.608
and we've only written one song!

08:29.610 --> 08:32.177
(resumes playing)

08:32.945 --> 08:34.112
(loud gulping)

08:34.114 --> 08:35.780
Man. (gulps)

08:35.782 --> 08:39.618
Staying on this all-pork-chop
diet is easier than I thought.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.286
That diet doesn't work.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.622
You have to give it a year.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.123
So, how was
school today?

08:45.125 --> 08:46.625
Well, actually,

08:46.627 --> 08:49.127
I caused quite a ruckus
in the nurse's office

08:49.129 --> 08:51.296
by pointing out they
weren't putting fresh paper

08:51.298 --> 08:52.998
on the lay-down table.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.200
Very good, sweetie.
Could you lean back?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.801
I have to focus
on your brother.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.471
Sure, sure. No need
to worry about Lisa.

08:59.473 --> 09:01.006
Lisa's always fine.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.307
No worries there. Nah.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.210
(scratching sound)

09:06.312 --> 09:08.179
(barking)

09:08.181 --> 09:10.815
Aw. What are you doing here?

09:10.817 --> 09:13.685
I bet you escaped, and now
Flanders is worried sick.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.321
I should call him...
after I scratch your tummy!

09:16.323 --> 09:17.856
That's right!

09:17.858 --> 09:20.725
Who likes their tummy scratched
while Flanders is worried sick?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.662
You do! You do!
Yes, you do!

09:23.664 --> 09:25.497
Oh, he doesn't know
where you are.

09:25.499 --> 09:28.033
(laughing):
Yes, he's probably
crying right now.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.501
(growling)

09:29.503 --> 09:31.570
Come on, boy.
We'll go to my room.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.839
I can play jazz, or
give you a bath, or...

09:34.841 --> 09:36.174
(sighs)

09:36.176 --> 09:37.776
Never chooses jazz.

09:38.711 --> 09:39.678
Hmm?

09:39.680 --> 09:41.746
(grunts)
(groans)

09:42.748 --> 09:45.350
Middle child. No one cares
about the middle child.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.718
Never, ever gonna change.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.553
Lisa, can I talk to you?

09:48.555 --> 09:50.255
Oh, here it is,
the quick check-in

09:50.257 --> 09:52.223
every two years
just like clockwork.

09:52.225 --> 09:55.860
All right, let me speak to you
in a language you'll understand.

09:55.862 --> 09:58.530
Oh, boy, oh, boy,
Lisa never gets it.

09:58.532 --> 09:59.864
She's great,
and everyone knows that.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.700
Oh, man, trying to stay mad.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.535
I'm kind of impressed
that Dad's making an effort.

10:03.537 --> 10:05.036
It's not really like him.
I shouldn't say this.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.538
I should <i>never</i> say this,
but I will.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.872
She's my favorite child.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.874
Oh, now he's pulling out
the big guns.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.443
Oh, I don't want
to pout anymore.

ice cream? (whoops)
Yes!

Ice cream. Oh, yeah,
it's kid whiskey.
I knew he was gonna break.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.551

That makes them happy,

10:31.598 --> 10:34.232

11:07.601 --> 11:09.134
Just hand me
