00:03.658 --> 00:05.517
Man: <i>Previously on "Stitchers..."</i>

00:05.542 --> 00:08.048
His name was Ed Clark. My real father
parked me with him when I was eight.

00:08.073 --> 00:10.330
We're not teammates. We're not co-workers.

00:10.354 --> 00:11.767
Well, that definitely is clarifying.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.064
Kirsten: <i>Has anyone
ever done this before?</i>

00:13.089 --> 00:14.501
Cameron: <i>Her name's Marta.
She couldn't handle it.</i>

00:14.526 --> 00:15.796
What are you two doing here?

00:15.821 --> 00:17.511
I'm afraid that's above
your paygrade, Detective.

00:17.515 --> 00:19.783
Don't tell me. A secret
agency mission, right?

00:19.808 --> 00:21.806
- Is that the roommate?
- Camille, this is Linus.

00:21.831 --> 00:22.793
Woof!

00:22.818 --> 00:24.806
We're investigating
the death of Lisa Keller.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.564
- She was murdered.
- How do you know this?

00:26.589 --> 00:28.166
Cause we hacked into her brain

00:28.190 --> 00:30.326
after she died and read her memories.

00:30.351 --> 00:32.234
It's called stitching.

00:32.259 --> 00:34.759
You've gotta be freaking kidding me.

00:34.784 --> 00:38.595
You were under strict orders only to
observe Kirsten and report back to me.

00:38.620 --> 00:41.634
- How long have you been spying on me for?
- The entire last year.

00:41.659 --> 00:42.790
So, I'm being recruited?

00:42.815 --> 00:45.534
Hey, Fisher. Welcome to
the Stitchers program.

00:47.588 --> 00:50.040
(people laughing)

00:51.692 --> 00:53.704
Go, go, go. Move, move, move.

00:54.282 --> 00:56.082
Jewelry, now.

00:58.463 --> 01:00.815
- And the watch.
- Come on, man, not the watch.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.424
Wear it in good health.

01:03.668 --> 01:05.838
- You too, hurry up.
- Is that why you killed Lilly Ross?

01:05.863 --> 01:09.031
- Because she wasn't fast enough?
- Jewelry, now.

01:09.288 --> 01:10.830
Michelle from the hotel,

01:11.633 --> 01:14.575
what is she? Your wife? Your girlfriend?

01:15.620 --> 01:18.094
If you turn yourself in,
maybe we can help her.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.035
If I turn myself in,

01:20.060 --> 01:21.970
I'll rot in prison,

01:21.995 --> 01:23.962
and that is not happening!

God. There's like 50

01:53.498 --> 01:55.137
I'm gonna have to find a new place to park.

01:55.162 --> 01:56.842
This is all Ed's stuff from his apartment.

01:57.240 --> 01:59.192
Apparently, I am the closest thing

01:59.217 --> 02:00.342
he has to a living relative,

02:00.366 --> 02:02.965
so... Now it's mine.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.395
Well, great. I mean, we can add it

02:04.420 --> 02:05.664
to all the crap he left behind

02:05.689 --> 02:07.439
after the first time he moved out.

02:08.008 --> 02:09.387
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

02:09.412 --> 02:11.050
Aren't you just like a little curious

02:11.076 --> 02:11.980
what's in all these?

02:12.005 --> 02:13.942
Bringing that stuff into the
house was your idea, not mine.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.809
Yeah, come on, 'cause it's
kind of like a treasure hunt.

02:15.834 --> 02:18.715
I mean, maybe there's an old watch
in one of these you can sell.

02:19.448 --> 02:22.832
I mean, treasure forever
as a family heirloom.

02:23.047 --> 02:24.730
(mutters) I don't know.

02:24.755 --> 02:27.422
Ooh! See? <i>♪ Pictures! ♪</i>

02:31.201 --> 02:34.121
(gasps) No way.

02:34.146 --> 02:35.979
Do you even know what this is?

02:36.004 --> 02:38.233
A woman with no personal boundaries.

02:38.258 --> 02:41.677
This is a classic... (grunts)

02:41.702 --> 02:44.148
tube amp stereo system,

02:44.173 --> 02:45.794
and it's super high end.

02:45.819 --> 02:47.536
And super old.

02:47.561 --> 02:48.693
Well, let's fire this baby up.

02:48.718 --> 02:50.216
You know, I've been
meaning to get into vinyl.

02:50.241 --> 02:51.991
Oh. I thought you were into leather.

02:52.016 --> 02:54.322
Hilarious! Grab the turntable.

02:56.362 --> 02:58.996
- Mom?
- Huh?

03:00.107 --> 03:02.489
This is a picture of Ed and my mother.

03:03.494 --> 03:04.974
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

03:04.999 --> 03:07.249
The real "whoa," however, is...

03:07.501 --> 03:09.504
Who's been ripped out of the photo?

03:35.857 --> 03:38.830
This is a photo of Ed Clark and my mother.

03:39.660 --> 03:41.676
I see you've started
going through Ed's things.

03:41.712 --> 03:45.109
They're my things now. What was the
connection between him and my mother?

03:45.944 --> 03:48.374
Ed, your mother and father helped develop

03:48.399 --> 03:50.682
the Stitchers technology.
They were friends.

03:50.820 --> 03:53.393
- Just friends?
- As far as I know.

03:54.179 --> 03:57.030
And what does this mean? "Remember"?

03:58.417 --> 04:00.334
- I don't know.
- Gosh!

04:00.359 --> 04:03.276
Some days you are just
dripping with information,

04:03.301 --> 04:05.356
and then other days
you don't know anything.

04:05.381 --> 04:08.700
What possible motives could I have
to withhold information from you?

04:08.726 --> 04:11.068
Three, in descending order of probability:

04:11.093 --> 04:13.748
One, you know things about
me you don't want me to know;

04:13.773 --> 04:16.738
Two, you know things about me
you think I wouldn't want to know;

04:16.764 --> 04:19.358
And three, you legitimately know nothing.

04:19.382 --> 04:21.192
Four, I'm a Machiavellian bitch

04:21.218 --> 04:22.756
who believes that knowledge is power

04:22.780 --> 04:26.065
and wants to retain as much
power over others as I can.

04:26.282 --> 04:28.600
I stand corrected. Four motives.

04:29.316 --> 04:31.950
Well, it sounds like you
got me all figured out.

04:31.975 --> 04:34.092
Let me know when you settle on one.

04:34.381 --> 04:36.371
Ed ripped someone out of this picture.

04:36.396 --> 04:37.729
Any ideas who it was?

04:38.020 --> 04:41.974
No, but I assume it's someone
he didn't think very highly of.

04:42.776 --> 04:45.220
Keep it. I have a copy.

04:47.828 --> 04:50.630
In the late 1960s, William Zane Johnson

04:50.655 --> 04:53.656
began building modified
ST-70 tube systems.

04:53.681 --> 04:56.272
In 1983, he established the Hallmark

04:56.297 --> 04:58.959
of high definition sound
with the reference 600.

04:58.984 --> 05:02.709
It's 600 watts of
breathtaking thermionic power

05:02.734 --> 05:04.469
that has no peer. Ask anyone.

05:04.494 --> 05:06.389
I'm sorry I asked you.

05:08.317 --> 05:13.154
Hey, Stretch. Macchiato with just
the subtlest hint of Mexican cocoa?

05:13.802 --> 05:16.669
- Tell me about Maggie.
- I think she prefers chai lattes.

05:16.837 --> 05:19.478
She clearly knows more about
what we do here than she lets on.

05:19.503 --> 05:23.338
Maggie's inscrutable.
Seriously, she can't be scruted.

05:23.363 --> 05:25.396
So, are you ladies planning on setting up

05:25.421 --> 05:27.955
that old tube-based stereo
system all by yourselves?

05:27.980 --> 05:29.318
Of course.

05:31.874 --> 05:33.340
Uh, what?

05:33.461 --> 05:36.796
What if Cameron and I swing by later
tonight and we just do it for you?

05:37.654 --> 05:41.351
The implication being that
women aren't smart enough

05:41.376 --> 05:43.172
to hook up stereos themselves?

05:43.197 --> 05:44.595
(fake cough) Dumb-ass.

05:44.627 --> 05:48.084
No, no, no. It's just that
high-end audio is a guy thing.

05:48.109 --> 05:49.459
(fake cough) Double dumb-ass.

05:49.484 --> 05:51.284
It's true. It has to do with socialization.

05:51.309 --> 05:52.961
Girls listen to music for meaning.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.945
Guys listen to music for sonics.

05:55.656 --> 05:58.201
- (laughs)
- My God.

05:58.226 --> 06:00.259
We're working with cavemen.

06:00.284 --> 06:02.017
Yeah. Listen, boys,

06:02.042 --> 06:04.951
I studied electrical engineering
and acoustic wave theory.

06:04.976 --> 06:08.027
I think Kirsten and I can
handle setting up an old stereo.

06:08.052 --> 06:09.986
Well, if it's the system I'm thinking of,

06:10.011 --> 06:14.113
it has 16 separate tubes that have to
be placed into their proper sockets.

06:14.138 --> 06:17.324
I'd like to see you "acoustic wave theory"

06:17.349 --> 06:19.593
your way to figuring that one out.

06:21.388 --> 06:23.505
- (beeps)
- Oh, we're up, guys.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.633
So, what time should we come over tonight?

06:29.144 --> 06:30.665
(sighs)

06:30.690 --> 06:32.607
You really gotta learn
how to speak to women.

06:32.632 --> 06:34.991
What? I speak to a woman every night.

06:35.016 --> 06:36.527
Yeah, your mother.

06:37.478 --> 06:39.007
What's your point?

06:43.331 --> 06:46.315
Maggie: Lilly Ross, 25. Newlywed.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.536
Lilly and her husband, Scott,
were on their honeymoon,

06:48.561 --> 06:50.285
walking on Santa Monica Pier.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.676
Scott left her for a few minutes.

06:51.701 --> 06:54.901
When he returned, he found
her body in the alley.

06:54.926 --> 06:56.092
Why'd he leave her alone?

06:56.117 --> 06:58.951
He said that he was arranging
a romantic surprise for her.

06:58.976 --> 07:01.704
She died of blunt force trauma to
the head. Her jewelry was taken.

07:01.729 --> 07:04.480
- Sounds like a random robbery.
- Or made to look like one.

07:04.505 --> 07:08.396
70% of female murder victims are killed
by their boyfriends, exes, or husbands.

07:08.421 --> 07:10.337
So, why is this a Stitchers case?

07:10.362 --> 07:12.682
There's been a rash of tourist
robberies around the city.

07:12.707 --> 07:14.419
This is the first one
that's ended in a death.

07:14.444 --> 07:16.266
We don't know if they're connected,

07:16.291 --> 07:18.090
but if they are, we might
be able to stop them.

07:18.115 --> 07:19.418
Have the police questioned the husband?

07:19.443 --> 07:22.027
Briefly, but he was in
shock. He could barely talk.

07:22.052 --> 07:24.029
He's sedated, and he's
back in his hotel room.

07:24.054 --> 07:27.483
On her honeymoon. God, that just sucks.

07:27.508 --> 07:30.316
Why? Dead is dead, no
matter when it happens.

07:32.709 --> 07:36.628
You know... I don't think I'll ever
get used to that condition of hers.

07:36.663 --> 07:38.788
Man: Communications online.

07:39.313 --> 07:41.701
Cameron: I need a go,
no-go for stitch neurosync.

07:41.726 --> 07:43.522
- Life-sci.
- We are a go!

07:43.547 --> 07:45.048
- Cameron: Sub-bio.
- Go.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.576
- Engineering.
- Go!

07:46.601 --> 07:48.984
- Communications.
- Linus: Yeah, we're a go!

07:49.009 --> 07:50.288
- Cameron: Medical.
- Go.

07:50.531 --> 07:52.448
We are go for stitch neurosync.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.340
Okay, Pork Chop, you're on.

07:54.496 --> 07:56.902
I anticipate the blunt
force trauma to her head

07:56.927 --> 07:59.246
will make navigating
Lilly's memories tricky.

07:59.271 --> 08:03.250
I'll do what I can from here,
but be prepared for a bumpy ride.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.760
- Okay.
- Thunderbirds are go.

08:05.785 --> 08:07.708
Initiate stitch neurosync on my mark.

08:08.849 --> 08:11.285
Three, two,

08:11.607 --> 08:13.543
One...

08:15.387 --> 08:16.761
Mark!

08:18.614 --> 08:22.116
(distorted carnival music playing)

08:22.141 --> 08:23.652
(people whooping)

08:23.677 --> 08:26.207
What do you say we go
back to the hotel and...

08:26.232 --> 08:28.763
(scoffs) why does your
collar always do that?

08:31.416 --> 08:34.308
Oh! I left my phone at the
restaurant. I'll be right back.

08:37.037 --> 08:38.534
They're at the Santa Monica Pier.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.515
Scott just told Lilly he left his phone

08:40.539 --> 08:41.789
at a restaurant and left her alone.

08:41.815 --> 08:43.490
- (phone clicks)
- He lied.

08:43.515 --> 08:45.355
He's got his phone. He's making a call.

08:45.380 --> 08:47.488
I can't hear what he's saying.

08:47.513 --> 08:50.433
- (gasps)
- Someone's grabbing her.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.637
- Cameron: <i> Who?</i>
- (distortion)

08:53.777 --> 08:56.807
Where am I? Cameron, put me
back. I need to see the rest.

08:56.832 --> 08:58.404
That's the end of the line
for that memory thread.

08:58.429 --> 09:00.095
You're in an earlier memory now.

09:01.436 --> 09:03.187
You know what I hate about you?

09:08.209 --> 09:10.009
Her memories are going by too quickly.

09:10.034 --> 09:12.168
I was afraid this might happen. Sub-bio?

09:12.193 --> 09:14.048
Glutamate levels are increasing.

09:14.073 --> 09:15.816
Her brain is depolarizing fast.

09:15.841 --> 09:18.768
Okey. Her neurons are fizzling.
We can't slow them down.

09:21.481 --> 09:23.105
What are you doing?

09:23.798 --> 09:26.536
What is that? You know
what I hate about you?

09:26.952 --> 09:28.585
Show me.

09:29.696 --> 09:31.382
What's all this money for?

09:32.244 --> 09:33.992
I'm bouncing.

09:35.431 --> 09:37.832
- Lights to 100%.
- (gasps)

09:38.135 --> 09:39.718
What'd you see?

09:39.743 --> 09:41.693
Scott had an envelope filled with cash.

09:41.718 --> 09:43.966
Enough money to pay
someone to kill his wife.

09:44.107 --> 09:46.858
- Bastard.
- That's what it looks like,

09:47.097 --> 09:49.630
but I feel he's innocent.

09:56.616 --> 09:59.535
So, I guess Fisher's bringing Scott
in for questioning in the morning.

09:59.560 --> 10:03.072
- Mm-hmm.
- Damn it! This is antique technology.

10:03.097 --> 10:04.408
How hard can this be?

10:05.964 --> 10:07.702
Ugh! Okay, fine.

10:07.727 --> 10:11.127
What did you see in that stitch that makes
you think that douche didn't kill his wife?

10:11.139 --> 10:14.385
It wasn't something I saw.
It was something I felt.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.182
Yeah, but he lied to his wife,

10:16.207 --> 10:17.855
told her he left his
phone at the restaurant,

10:17.880 --> 10:20.550
then used it to make a call.
How do you explain that?

10:20.576 --> 10:21.888
I can't.

10:22.821 --> 10:24.521
But it doesn't make sense.

10:24.546 --> 10:26.783
I want to be there when
Fisher questions him.

10:26.808 --> 10:29.152
- Why?
- Cognitive dissonance.

10:29.203 --> 10:31.442
Scott's actions to Lilly don't match

10:31.466 --> 10:33.363
the emotions Lilly felt towards him.

10:33.388 --> 10:34.504
Mm-hmm.

10:34.753 --> 10:36.721
I need to be with Scott.

10:38.081 --> 10:40.519
Excuse me? You need to be with this guy?

10:40.544 --> 10:41.877
Not be with him, just...

10:41.902 --> 10:43.685
Be around when he's questioned.

10:43.710 --> 10:46.152
Okay, just, like, trust me on this one:

10:46.177 --> 10:48.365
Relationships are very messy.

10:48.389 --> 10:50.050
Yeah, that doesn't mean you turn psycho.

10:50.076 --> 10:51.910
You should meet my last boyfriend.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.022
That's what I'm talking about.
One down, 15 to go. Okay.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.190
- So, what do you think of Linus?
- Linus?

11:00.215 --> 11:03.318
- Mm-hmm.
- He's capable, good at what he does.

11:05.181 --> 11:06.531
Why?

11:08.064 --> 11:10.064
Are you interested in him?

11:10.943 --> 11:12.912
(laughs) What?

11:13.661 --> 11:15.884
No. I was just... (clears throat)

11:16.714 --> 11:17.884
No.

11:18.815 --> 11:21.649
- Okay.
- Ooh!

11:21.674 --> 11:24.334
Look what I found.

11:24.714 --> 11:26.291
Okay.

11:33.039 --> 11:34.709
Kirsten.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.672
(door opens, closes)

11:56.974 --> 11:59.986
Okay. You saw me question him.

12:00.011 --> 12:01.810
What do you think?

12:03.246 --> 12:04.738
I think he's innocent.

12:04.763 --> 12:07.547
(sighs) I'm not convinced.

12:07.572 --> 12:09.699
Yeah, that's because you
didn't ask the right questions.

12:09.724 --> 12:11.557
You didn't ask about the
envelope full of money,

12:11.597 --> 12:13.707
and you didn't ask about how he
treated Lilly in the hotel room.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.698
Are you serious? Is she serious?

12:15.723 --> 12:16.886
Almost always.

12:16.911 --> 12:18.843
I can't ask him about
things that you know of

12:18.868 --> 12:21.390
because you were in his
dead wife's memories.

12:21.415 --> 12:23.059
How do I explain how I know any of that?

12:23.084 --> 12:25.367
How will you prove his
innocence without asking?

12:25.392 --> 12:27.639
If he's guilty, eventually
we'll figure it out.

12:29.581 --> 12:31.481
He didn't ask for a lawyer.

12:31.742 --> 12:33.875
Guilty people ask for
lawyers. Innocent ones don't.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.699
That's not always the case.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.457
Need more convincing?

12:37.482 --> 12:39.176
Scott took out a life insurance policy

12:39.201 --> 12:40.956
on Lilly one week before their wedding.

12:40.981 --> 12:42.992
(cellphone ringing)

12:44.208 --> 12:46.292
(sighs) Wait here.

12:46.317 --> 12:48.400
My captain needs to chew
me out about something.

12:48.425 --> 12:51.134
(door opens, closes)

12:59.471 --> 13:01.147
(chuckles)

13:02.153 --> 13:04.477
He is innocent. I know it.

13:04.622 --> 13:08.741
You said it yourself: 70% of female
murder victims are killed by men they know.

13:08.766 --> 13:10.617
Not this one.

13:18.355 --> 13:20.323
What are you doing?

13:22.559 --> 13:24.225
(sighs)

13:27.510 --> 13:29.211
This'll end poorly.

13:39.576 --> 13:41.368
Mr. Ross?

13:41.956 --> 13:44.527
- Who are you?
- My name is Kirsten Clark.

13:44.552 --> 13:47.867
- Are you a cop?
- I want to talk to you about Lilly.

13:47.893 --> 13:51.102
I already told Detective
Fisher everything I know.

13:51.974 --> 13:54.785
When are you people gonna find
the man who killed my wife?

13:56.909 --> 13:58.489
We're working on it.

13:58.816 --> 14:00.825
He thinks that I killed her, doesn't he?

14:03.204 --> 14:05.337
He isn't sure, but maybe.

14:05.419 --> 14:06.820
Why?

14:07.643 --> 14:09.031
Why would he think that?

14:09.211 --> 14:12.671
You took out a life
insurance policy on Lilly.

14:12.696 --> 14:14.746
Yeah, and she took one out on me.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.655
We did it to take care of
each other, just in case...

14:18.385 --> 14:20.346
Look, I already told the
detective all of this.

14:20.371 --> 14:22.266
Why are you making me go through it again?

14:31.729 --> 14:35.397
Lilly found money in the hotel room,

14:35.422 --> 14:37.448
money you were hiding from her.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.797
It was for a present for her... a necklace.

14:41.822 --> 14:44.818
I told the detective that it was stolen.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.055
Diamond and sapphire.

14:54.910 --> 14:57.214
Lilly was wearing it when she was attacked,

14:57.239 --> 15:01.224
and you bought it with
that envelope of cash,

15:01.249 --> 15:03.989
so now it's hard to prove it even existed.

15:05.620 --> 15:07.237
How do you know this?

15:08.425 --> 15:10.459
Why did you say you hated her?

15:10.766 --> 15:13.653
"You know what I hate about
you?" you said that to her.

15:13.678 --> 15:15.357
Why... why did you say that?

15:15.949 --> 15:18.950
Who told you that? Were
you... were you watching us?

15:19.721 --> 15:22.421
- No.
- What kind of cop are you?

15:22.446 --> 15:24.602
- (door opens, closes)
- Fisher: Alright, you two.

15:24.627 --> 15:26.141
What the hell is she doing?

15:26.166 --> 15:29.102
(stammers)

15:29.355 --> 15:31.358
She's interrogating the witness.

15:31.383 --> 15:33.518
She's gonna compromise the whole case.

15:34.084 --> 15:36.359
I'm just trying to help you.

15:36.688 --> 15:38.642
You want to help me?

15:38.815 --> 15:41.416
Find the man who killed my wife.

15:42.385 --> 15:43.172
Scott.

15:43.197 --> 15:45.075
No! I am done talking to you
without a lawyer.

15:45.076 --> 15:47.181
Get out! Leave me alone!

16:03.336 --> 16:05.763
(sighs) Impersonating a police officer?

16:05.788 --> 16:06.922
Are you insane?

16:06.947 --> 16:08.482
I never said I was a cop.

16:09.107 --> 16:11.596
And he's innocent. I feel it.

16:11.803 --> 16:14.244
Kirsten, I have no dog in this fight.

16:14.269 --> 16:15.851
He's innocent, he's guilty...

16:15.876 --> 16:17.125
I just want the truth.

16:17.150 --> 16:19.867
But you're getting into
something that's over your head.

16:19.892 --> 16:21.808
What was going on with you in there?

16:25.334 --> 16:27.134
I don't know. I...

16:28.321 --> 16:30.238
I just felt this connection.

16:30.263 --> 16:32.213
It's residual emotion. That's all.

16:32.238 --> 16:33.750
What's residual emotion?

16:33.775 --> 16:38.030
From being stitched. Kirsten's inherited
some traces of Lilly's feelings.

16:38.164 --> 16:42.899
I could sense it... the way
that Lilly understood... Him.

16:42.924 --> 16:44.640
She knew who he was.

16:46.102 --> 16:48.440
There wasn't any anger or animosity.

16:48.658 --> 16:50.767
It... it wasn't that kind of relationship.

16:50.792 --> 16:55.279
She heard him say that he hated
her, and she knew that he didn't.

16:55.303 --> 16:57.565
Okay, well, maybe he said
that during an argument

16:57.598 --> 16:59.799
or in the heat of the moment.
Sometimes people get hurt.

17:01.565 --> 17:04.483
- Are we still talking about Lilly?
- What?

17:06.429 --> 17:07.945
Yeah.

17:11.917 --> 17:13.482
What was that about?

17:19.396 --> 17:22.240
Camille: Excuse me.
Everything okay down there?

17:23.742 --> 17:27.391
Yes. Just checking the
nanobot annealing processor.

17:27.946 --> 17:30.947
Oh. That's interesting.

17:30.972 --> 17:33.019
- We have nanobots.
- Of course.

17:33.222 --> 17:35.825
We use nanobot technology in the bodies

17:35.850 --> 17:37.547
to bridge their synaptic gaps.

17:37.572 --> 17:39.688
It's the key into stitching
into their memories.

17:39.713 --> 17:41.491
That's so interesting. Not really.

17:41.516 --> 17:43.386
So, red or white?

17:44.174 --> 17:47.633
I'm not sure what color our nanobots are.

17:47.658 --> 17:49.404
- They're microscopic.
- Wine.

17:49.429 --> 17:52.191
Which do you prefer, red or white?

17:53.078 --> 17:55.717
Actually, my favorite wine is beer.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.407
Why do you ask?

17:57.432 --> 17:59.870
Just because I'm trying
to figure out what to serve

17:59.896 --> 18:02.259
when you and Cameron come over
tonight to help set up the stereo.

18:02.283 --> 18:06.706
I knew it! That tube amp
system kicked your scrawny ass!

18:07.788 --> 18:09.671
I'm so sorry. I'm an idiot.

18:09.696 --> 18:13.748
Firstly, there is nothing
scrawny about this ass.

18:13.773 --> 18:16.277
Secondly, that thing has 16 sockets,

18:16.302 --> 18:19.104
which makes for 298 possible
tube-to-socket combinations.

18:19.129 --> 18:22.585
Make no mistake, I can do it, but
it'll be faster with your help.

18:22.614 --> 18:25.281
So, come over at 7:00 and tell Cameron.

18:26.929 --> 18:29.244
Oh, and I don't think you're an idiot.

18:29.836 --> 18:32.830
- Thanks.
- You're more of an imbecile.

18:34.337 --> 18:36.287
(shouts) Interesting distinction.

18:37.665 --> 18:39.415
When can I stitch back into Lilly?

18:39.440 --> 18:40.733
We need to prove Scott's innocent.

18:40.758 --> 18:42.965
You are getting way too close to this.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.823
I thought this was what we do here...

18:44.848 --> 18:47.094
Catch the bad guys, clear the
good guys. What am I missing?

18:47.120 --> 18:49.806
You're having trouble separating
Lilly's emotions from your own.

18:49.831 --> 18:52.528
You think she's the first person who got
dead by someone she desperately loved?

18:52.553 --> 18:57.137
He didn't do it, and you... Don't talk
to me about emotional voodoo.

18:57.162 --> 18:59.012
What was the deal with you
back at the police station?

18:59.037 --> 19:01.317
- What deal? There was no deal.
- "Sometimes people get hurt."

19:01.342 --> 19:02.471
What was that?

19:02.496 --> 19:04.957
Maybe I was just waxing poetic.

19:04.982 --> 19:07.740
- (alert buzzing)
- Oh! Refractory period's up.

19:07.765 --> 19:11.126
If you wanna stitch
back in, now's the time.

19:13.541 --> 19:15.674
Stitch neurosync in three...

19:16.375 --> 19:20.053
Two... One... Mark.

19:28.770 --> 19:31.600
- Talk to me, Sunshine.
- I'm getting memory flashes again.

19:31.633 --> 19:33.929
Okay, we're using a protocol to slow down

19:33.954 --> 19:36.592
the electrical depolarization
in Lilly's brain. Sub-bio?

19:36.617 --> 19:39.405
Glutamate levels are down. Increasing
sodium and calcium inhibitors.

19:39.430 --> 19:40.638
Her E.P.'s steady.

19:40.663 --> 19:42.605
Can you hold the memories longer this time?

19:42.630 --> 19:43.775
I'm on it.

19:46.171 --> 19:47.734
Brace yourself.

19:50.225 --> 19:51.841
You know what I hate about you?

19:51.866 --> 19:53.309
You know what he hates about her?

19:53.631 --> 19:55.207
What?

19:55.232 --> 19:57.088
- Nothing.
- (chuckles)

20:03.399 --> 20:05.603
Nothing.

20:18.568 --> 20:20.120
What are you doing?

20:23.041 --> 20:25.423
What is that, Lilly? Show me.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.410
What's all this money for?

20:29.435 --> 20:31.151
Oh, babe.

20:31.176 --> 20:33.092
It's for that necklace you wanted.

20:33.117 --> 20:35.166
It was supposed to be a surprise.

20:46.755 --> 20:49.173
He did buy her the necklace.

21:02.663 --> 21:05.331
Cameron, he didn't kill
her, I need to see who did.

21:05.356 --> 21:07.565
Time's running out. You need to bounce.

21:07.590 --> 21:10.445
- Not yet.
- Cameron, she's not Marta.

21:18.549 --> 21:20.332
They're on their way to the lunch.

21:20.357 --> 21:21.925
She wasn't killed until after.

21:21.950 --> 21:23.165
Put me into that memory.

21:23.190 --> 21:24.356
Bio, how is she?

21:24.381 --> 21:27.106
Her cerebral temp's normal,
but her heart rate is up.

21:27.132 --> 21:31.002
114 beats per minute.
Her B.P. is 150 over 90.

21:31.027 --> 21:34.069
You don't have time, make the bounce!

21:35.953 --> 21:38.341
Kirsten, make the bounce!

21:50.878 --> 21:53.085
They took an L.A. Wheels car to the beach.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.811
We need to find that driver.

22:00.623 --> 22:03.667
Guys, it's a dead end.

22:03.692 --> 22:06.887
Fisher says the LAPD questioned
the Ross' L.A. Wheels driver.

22:06.912 --> 22:09.534
He was at a sports bar three
miles away when Lilly was killed.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.026
Okay, well, I just hacked into
the L.A. Wheels mapping system.

22:12.051 --> 22:14.467
This shows the location of every
one of their cars in Los Angeles.

22:14.492 --> 22:16.129
That's the pier.

22:16.154 --> 22:21.168
I'm rolling the map back to
Saturday between 12:15 and 12:30 P.M.

22:21.193 --> 22:23.403
When Scott said the car dropped them off.

22:24.073 --> 22:25.707
And that's the Ross' car?

22:25.732 --> 22:28.274
Yeah. And here it is at the sports bar.

22:29.141 --> 22:31.034
His alibi holds.

22:31.059 --> 22:35.251
I need... want to see Scott again.

22:35.276 --> 22:37.067
Ask him about the car service.

22:37.092 --> 22:38.410
We can have Fisher call him.

22:38.435 --> 22:40.046
No, I should do this in person.

22:40.071 --> 22:42.134
I'll go to his hotel.

22:43.037 --> 22:45.697
I know what you're
thinking, and it's not that.

22:45.856 --> 22:48.709
He already thinks I'm a cop.
Plus, I feel like he'll talk to me.

22:48.734 --> 22:50.520
I feel...

22:50.545 --> 22:51.578
A connection?

22:51.603 --> 22:54.019
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm worried about.

22:54.044 --> 22:56.633
All right, stitching affects you,
makes you different for a little bit.

22:56.658 --> 22:59.222
It doesn't always last,
but it's noticeable.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.935
Okay, maybe you're right.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.334
Stitching does change me a little.

23:02.359 --> 23:04.589
But, I also can't stop
doing the job I need to do.

23:04.614 --> 23:05.674
- Yeah...
- I'm going to Scott's hotel.

23:05.699 --> 23:06.929
I'm telling you it's a bad idea.

23:06.954 --> 23:09.225
And that's why you shouldn't come.

23:12.249 --> 23:15.173
If you're worried, why
don't you go with her?

23:16.417 --> 23:18.953
It's obvious she doesn't want me to.

23:24.969 --> 23:26.634
So, what do we do now?

23:26.955 --> 23:29.232
Well, I guess let's go back
to my place and hook up...

23:29.257 --> 23:30.487
- Yes!
- The stereo.

23:30.512 --> 23:31.511
Right.

23:31.536 --> 23:33.447
That's what I was excited about.

23:34.273 --> 23:36.407
Yeah, me too.

23:46.924 --> 23:49.773
Is this what torturing
one's self looks like?

23:49.798 --> 23:52.222
When you pulled me from
my cozy research position

23:52.247 --> 23:54.204
and dropped me into the Stitchers program,

23:54.229 --> 23:56.489
you didn't warn me people could get hurt.

23:56.514 --> 24:00.850
One of the most crucial devices
in our lab, one you helped design,

24:00.875 --> 24:02.331
is called "the corpse cassette."

24:02.356 --> 24:05.104
I didn't think that I needed
to prepare you emotionally

24:05.129 --> 24:06.198
for what that implies.

24:06.223 --> 24:09.054
I studied neuroscience, I've
been around cadavers for years.

24:09.079 --> 24:11.235
It's not the already dead that bother me.

24:12.350 --> 24:15.185
Kirsten is different than
Marta. You know that, don't you?

24:15.210 --> 24:17.210
Yes, but is she different enough?

24:17.634 --> 24:20.494
Marta is in this condition
because she couldn't separate

24:20.519 --> 24:23.815
her emotions from the sample
that she stitched into.

24:24.994 --> 24:27.695
I'm worried Kirsten is
falling into the same trap.

24:30.241 --> 24:31.824
Cameron?

24:32.892 --> 24:34.319
I know that you don't like me.

24:34.344 --> 24:37.595
No, it... it's okay. You don't need to.

24:37.620 --> 24:39.821
And you don't trust me.

24:40.929 --> 24:44.038
But the things that we are
doing have a noble purpose,

24:44.063 --> 24:47.064
and anything with a
noble purpose has risks.

24:47.089 --> 24:50.472
Now, I can't tell you everything
about the Stitchers program,

24:50.497 --> 24:51.831
but when we are done,

24:51.856 --> 24:55.141
you will look back and know that you
were part of something very important.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.607
I can promise you that.

25:05.457 --> 25:08.392
What I can't promise you

25:08.417 --> 25:11.066
is that no one else will get hurt.

25:26.350 --> 25:29.373
<i>(Kirsten knocking) Mr. Ross?</i>

25:30.262 --> 25:31.664
Oh, it's you.

25:31.827 --> 25:34.795
Do you have any news or anything?

25:34.820 --> 25:36.619
May I come in?

25:52.965 --> 25:54.987
Do you know who killed Lilly?

25:55.595 --> 25:57.155
No.

26:00.567 --> 26:02.842
You're not even police, are you?

26:03.817 --> 26:05.700
No.

26:05.750 --> 26:07.644
But, I do work with them.

26:07.806 --> 26:09.908
They still think I'm guilty.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.180
But I don't.

26:15.511 --> 26:17.555
And how are you gonna prove that?

26:19.993 --> 26:24.108
The night that Lilly was murdered, you
took an L.A. Wheels car to the beach.

26:24.964 --> 26:27.265
Yeah, the concierge arranged it.

26:27.290 --> 26:30.058
Michelle. She had red hair.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.183
Lilly looked so beautiful that night.

26:32.663 --> 26:34.374
I know.

26:35.875 --> 26:37.989
What are you doing?

26:38.638 --> 26:40.438
I'm trying to help you.

26:40.463 --> 26:42.974
The police are right.

26:42.999 --> 26:44.760
I killed Lilly.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.316
No.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.655
That's impossible.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.464
You act like you know me,

26:51.489 --> 26:53.406
but you don't know anything.

26:54.099 --> 26:55.687
I did kill Lilly!

26:55.824 --> 26:57.740
I left her on that pier.

27:01.253 --> 27:04.237
She was... she was murdered
because I wasn't there...

27:04.706 --> 27:08.117
Because I snuck off to call the hotel

27:08.142 --> 27:10.797
just so they could send up
a stupid bottle of champagne!

27:12.859 --> 27:14.805
- Scott.
- Get out.

27:15.931 --> 27:17.821
You are not Lilly.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.485
You're not anyone.

27:19.510 --> 27:20.685
Get out.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.367
Hey, how do you like your beer?

27:35.392 --> 27:37.057
In my mouth and then in my stomach.

27:37.082 --> 27:39.082
Yeah, I meant bottle or glass?

27:39.107 --> 27:40.529
- Bottle's fine.
- Great.

27:41.199 --> 27:43.156
So, what time is Cameron coming over?

27:43.181 --> 27:45.920
I have no idea. He left the lab
all mysterious about something.

27:45.945 --> 27:47.944
He does that sometimes. He
doesn't tell me where he goes.

27:47.969 --> 27:50.312
He doesn't tell you? That's weird.
I thought you guys were friends.

27:50.337 --> 27:52.966
Oh, we are. We're like besties.

27:52.991 --> 27:54.926
Really? What's he do on the weekends?

27:54.951 --> 27:56.033
I have no idea.

27:56.058 --> 27:57.107
What kind of music is he into?

27:57.132 --> 27:58.422
- You got me.
- Is he seeing anyone?

27:58.447 --> 27:59.609
Okay, I barely know the guy.

27:59.634 --> 28:00.905
- (laughs)
- Jeez.

28:00.937 --> 28:03.128
It's the same with me and Kirsten.

28:03.153 --> 28:04.875
Look, we live together,

28:04.900 --> 28:07.226
we went to school together,
now we work together,

28:07.251 --> 28:09.709
and I still don't really
know that much about her.

28:09.734 --> 28:12.359
Everyone's connected 24/7

28:12.384 --> 28:14.370
with status updates and texting,

28:14.395 --> 28:17.563
but no one is really connected.

28:17.588 --> 28:19.010
It's sad.

28:19.035 --> 28:20.720
It's so sad.

28:21.146 --> 28:23.800
So very...

28:24.113 --> 28:25.946
Very...

28:25.971 --> 28:28.404
Unbearably sad.

28:30.483 --> 28:32.463
Okay! Uh...

28:32.488 --> 28:34.605
Looks like this is all set up.

28:34.841 --> 28:36.328
Let's light this candle.

28:36.353 --> 28:38.059
Yeah, let's do something.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.507
Whoa.

28:42.408 --> 28:44.208
That thing's drawing a ton of power.

28:44.233 --> 28:46.133
Yeah, let's kill the
lights, give it more juice.

Actually, you said you needed to,

29:19.844 --> 29:21.205
which is pretty much the reason I'm here.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.297
You find out anything from Scott?

29:23.329 --> 29:24.528
Yes.

29:24.553 --> 29:27.390
The concierge arranged the car
that took them to the beach.

29:28.452 --> 29:29.927
You sure?

29:30.455 --> 29:31.955
Yeah.

29:31.980 --> 29:36.271

jewelry, she looks like a target.

Eh, within seven days, assuming
that your plan doesn't get us killed.

30:15.901 --> 30:18.246
You sure we didn't overdo it a
little? We're not exactly subtle.

30:18.271 --> 30:20.238
We're not trying to be subtle,
we're trying to be targets.

30:20.263 --> 30:22.862
Mmm, I liked it better
when we were shopping.

30:23.933 --> 30:25.031

30:25.056 --> 30:27.485
We're thinking of

30:27.510 --> 30:30.384
maybe someplace by the Santa Monica Pier?

30:30.409 --> 30:31.566
Can you call us a cab?

30:31.591 --> 30:33.023
Are you guests of the hotel?

30:33.048 --> 30:35.806
Uh, not yet. We'll be checking in...

30:35.831 --> 30:37.982
Later-ish.

30:45.928 --> 30:50.010
The hotel has an account with
a car service. I'll call them.

30:50.035 --> 30:52.047
Sounds perfect.

30:58.603 --> 30:59.794
You don't have to do this.

It doesn't make sense.

32:32.641 --> 32:33.807
You're not seriously complaining

32:33.832 --> 32:35.383
because the guy didn't attack us?

32:36.129 --> 32:38.279
I saw him in the stitch.
It was the same guy.

32:38.304 --> 32:40.333
Maybe he's just a driver?

32:40.358 --> 32:42.275
If he was gonna rob us, he would have.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.902
Excuse me, do you have the time?

32:43.927 --> 32:45.009
Oh, yeah, sure, it's...

Don't make a sound.

32:46.869 --> 32:48.457
Let's go.

32:49.009 --> 32:50.634
The driver has a partner.

32:50.659 --> 32:52.889
Now it makes sense.

32:59.029 --> 33:00.028
Wow.

33:00.053 --> 33:02.186
Look at this place.

33:02.717 --> 33:07.252
You are deceptively athletic
for someone of your stature.

33:07.403 --> 33:09.478
- Ugh.
- Mm-hmm.

33:09.503 --> 33:12.166
Tomorrow, you will reflect on that comment

33:12.191 --> 33:13.857
- and cringe.
- Ah?

33:13.882 --> 33:15.672
Yeah.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.829
Oh, damn.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.447
Go, go, go. Move, move, move.

33:28.992 --> 33:30.692
Jewelry, now.

33:32.763 --> 33:33.729
And the watch.

33:33.754 --> 33:35.003
Come on, man, not the watch!

33:35.028 --> 33:36.527
Wear it in good health.

33:37.826 --> 33:39.158
You too. Hurry up.

33:39.183 --> 33:41.686
Is that why you killed Lilly Ross?
Because she wasn't fast enough?

33:41.711 --> 33:42.861
What?

33:42.886 --> 33:45.920
You threw her down, she hit her head.

33:45.945 --> 33:48.726
Stop talking!

33:48.751 --> 33:50.384
So, the concierge calls the car,

33:50.409 --> 33:52.718
the driver takes the victim somewhere
you're waiting, and then you rob them.

33:52.743 --> 33:54.390
I said shut up!

33:54.415 --> 33:56.113
I don't think he's in
the mood for chit-chat.

33:56.138 --> 33:58.858
People spend their whole
lives trying to find someone,

33:58.883 --> 34:00.673
to connect with someone,

34:00.698 --> 34:02.952
and you destroyed that.

34:02.977 --> 34:04.173
Kirsten, stop talking.

34:04.198 --> 34:06.109
You should listen to your girlfriend.

34:06.134 --> 34:07.065
Ouch.

34:07.090 --> 34:08.849
Jewelry, now.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.661
Now!

34:12.483 --> 34:14.092
Michelle from the hotel.

34:14.367 --> 34:18.063
What is she? Your wife? Your girlfriend?

34:18.773 --> 34:21.428
If you turn yourself in,
maybe we can help her.

34:21.628 --> 34:25.340
If I turn myself in, I'll rot in prison,

34:25.364 --> 34:27.858
and that is not happening!

34:40.777 --> 34:43.411
Thank you.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.420
Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go vomit.

35:09.186 --> 35:10.886
What about the driver?

35:10.911 --> 35:13.161
We put out an A.P.B. He won't get far.

35:13.186 --> 35:16.405
Turns out he and his two buddies
were running the same scam for weeks.

35:16.430 --> 35:19.397
Concierge booked the driver
for affluent hotel guests,

35:19.422 --> 35:21.747
he dropped them off, set up his alibi,

35:21.772 --> 35:23.383
and his partner would rob them.

35:24.342 --> 35:26.594
Kirsten, you were right about Scott.

35:28.034 --> 35:29.834
I almost misread him, but you didn't.

35:29.924 --> 35:31.668
I had an unfair advantage.

35:31.693 --> 35:34.044
Yeah. Residual emotions.

35:35.763 --> 35:37.197

35:46.995 --> 35:48.218
Thanks.

35:48.243 --> 35:50.210
Hey, so maybe you and I
can go grab a beer sometime?

35:50.235 --> 35:51.918
No.

36:01.267 --> 36:04.318
I owe you an apology, and a thank you.

36:04.659 --> 36:06.659
No, you don't owe me anything.

36:06.891 --> 36:08.829

believed that I was innocent,

36:08.854 --> 36:11.853

Peter and Julie,

and now Scott and Lilly.

37:59.062 --> 38:01.487
Is this what love is?

38:03.087 --> 38:06.889
Intense connection and
then heartbreaking loss?

38:07.561 --> 38:09.160
Maybe.

38:10.845 --> 38:12.527

Kirsten?

39:16.560 --> 39:17.759
I made you a tape.

39:17.784 --> 39:20.991
It's a recording of me reading
three of your favorite stories...

39:21.016 --> 39:23.328
One for each night for when I'm gone.

39:23.353 --> 39:26.247
And you can play it on my special stereo.

39:26.272 --> 39:29.360
But, I thought you said I
wasn't allowed to use it?

39:30.305 --> 39:32.479

40:46.969 --> 40:50.608
<i>They longed very much for a child,</i>

40:51.069 --> 40:53.696

had a little daughter,</i>

40:53.721 --> 40:55.655
<i>they were both delighted,</i>

40:55.680 --> 40:58.784

41:02.461 --> 41:03.594
<i>But...</i>

41:03.619 --> 41:08.000
<i>The Angry Fairy confronted
the king and queen</i>

41:08.025 --> 41:09.808
<i>and said,</i>

<i>"when the princess is 15 years old,</i>
