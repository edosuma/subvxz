Jesus said that my world
was gonna get a whole lot bigger.

01:49.776 --> 01:52.188
Well, we found that world.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.646
We found each other.

01:57.326 --> 02:02.196
That..."bigger world" is ours by right.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.826
That we've come together for it,

02:04.916 --> 02:07.453
all of us...

02:07.544 --> 02:09.955
it's that much more true...

02:49.461 --> 02:51.077
we end them.

02:53.173 --> 02:56.837
We don't... celebrate it.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.215
We don't have shame about it, either.

03:03.100 --> 03:05.592
There's only one person
who has to die...

03:07.020 --> 03:08.681

doesn't end this morning.

That we may have to live
in uncertainty for days, maybe more.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.994
That we have to keep our faith
in each other.

04:58.089 --> 05:01.207
If we can hold on to that
with everything we have...

05:02.677 --> 05:04.668

09:05.795 --> 09:06.910
I'm not, but...

09:08.256 --> 09:09.496
I've been shot at.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.465
Someone threw a microwave at me.

09:12.552 --> 09:15.465
So I-I'm just gonna say

09:15.555 --> 09:17.887
something my mom used to say

09:17.974 --> 09:19.885
and hope for the best here.

"Whatever you have of good,
spend on the traveler."

09:24.939 --> 09:28.898
My mom said that--
that helping the traveler,

09:28.985 --> 09:32.853
the person without a home--
that's everything.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.319
I'm sure you've seen things,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.696
been through things,
that you don't trust people.

09:38.787 --> 09:41.074

09:41.164 --> 09:42.825
I don't, either.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.951
I've been through things, too.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.413
My mom-- she also said that,

09:50.507 --> 09:52.498
"May my mercy prevail over my wrath."

09:55.261 --> 09:57.593

09:57.680 --> 10:00.092
Probably shouldn't have said that.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.924
I don't even know you,

10:02.018 --> 10:05.101
but I ha-- I haven't eaten in a few days.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.270
You might not even be real.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.606
Hands up.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.277
Listen. I'm gone.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.775
Huh? It's cool.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.196
I just--

10:17.283 --> 10:20.150

even just some food.

at the intersection.

10:38.429 --> 10:40.215
I shot over his head.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.138
- I just wanted him gone.
- He said that he was--

10:42.225 --> 10:44.592
I heard what he said. Most of it.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.014
But he could've been one of them.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.100
Like a spy?

10:53.611 --> 10:56.273
I shot above his head.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.152
If he isn't one of them,
I hope he makes it.

11:02.412 --> 11:05.029
- It's not gonna be enough, Dad.

Are you?

13:35.189 --> 13:38.181
It's one person who brought it to this.

13:38.276 --> 13:39.357
One person.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.560
It always starts with one person.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.612
This did.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.736
What we're doing here now.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.819
This... this isn't about me.

13:50.913 --> 13:53.746

to stand against the Saviors.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.006
I need to be there.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.209
At least for the first part.

19:40.137 --> 19:43.050

through the second trimester.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.346

19:44.433 --> 19:46.424
I've been fighting since the farm.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.385
Can't stop now.

19:48.479 --> 19:50.561
How about tomorrow?

19:50.648 --> 19:53.436
You been thinking about
what that looks like?

19:53.526 --> 19:54.937
Yes, I have.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.689
I don't know if I can wait for it.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.646
Just one more fight.

19:59.740 --> 20:02.357
And I'm gonna be there.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.783
At least for the first part.

Ezekiel:
I'm told the Hilltop lost their doctor.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.448
An obstetrician, no less.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.329
We have a doctor in the Kingdom.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.957
A woman of talent. Join us.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.833
We'll get ours back.

20:18.634 --> 20:19.749
Uaughs)

20:20.886 --> 20:22.718
Yes, Jesus.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.466
Yes, you will.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.891
As sure as the day defeats the night.

20:27.977 --> 20:32.016
And on this day,
we begin to reshape this world

20:32.106 --> 20:34.643
for your child
and the children to come.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.858
So let's get started.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.571
(sighs)

20:42.783 --> 20:44.365
What?

20:44.452 --> 20:46.534
Hilltop's lucky to have you.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.747
You showed me how to be
someone worth following.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.495
Good.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.372
After this...

20:55.463 --> 20:57.625

Shit.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.286
(wind whistling)

21:45.387 --> 21:46.877
No. There.

21:48.933 --> 21:51.721
Okay. Close enough.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.018
- All right, let's go.
- Got it?

21:54.104 --> 21:56.220
- Yeah.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.773
do you think you have the numbers
for this fight?

29:50.914 --> 29:52.655
You don't.

30:38.587 --> 30:42.421
they will no longer be welcome
in the colony.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.258
And?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.591
Their families will be thrown out

30:50.682 --> 30:52.923
and will be left to fend for themselves.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.472
And?

30:58.857 --> 31:01.224
Go home now.

31:01.318 --> 31:04.356
Or you won't have a home to go back to.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.905

31:22.798 --> 31:24.414
All I have at the Hilltop

31:24.508 --> 31:26.795
are a bunch of books
and an old lobster bib.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.712
Negan: You heard the man.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.218
Go back to separating wheat and shit

31:33.308 --> 31:36.300
or whatever the hell it is you people do.
