00:53.960 --> 00:58.682
With every sun comes a new day.
A new beginning.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.322
A hope that things will be better today
than they were yesterday.

01:03.520 --> 01:06.171
But not for me.
My name is Eep.

01:06.320 --> 01:09.449
And this is my family, the Croods.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.679
If you weren't clued in already by the
animal skins

01:11.680 --> 01:14.251
and sloping foreheads,
we're cavemen.

01:15.600 --> 01:20.003
Most days we spend in our cave,
in the dark.

01:20.160 --> 01:24.688
Night after night, day after day.

01:24.840 --> 01:28.890
Yep, home sweet home.

01:29.040 --> 01:33.841
When we did go out, we struggled to
find food in a harsh and hostile world.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.801
And I struggled to survive my family.

01:39.800 --> 01:42.963
We were the last ones around.
There used to be neighbors.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.686
The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.810
The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.207
The Erfs, mosquito bite.

01:51.360 --> 01:55.046
Throgs, common cold.

01:55.200 --> 01:57.965
And the Croods, that's us.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.806
The Croods made it, because of my dad.

02:01.960 --> 02:05.567
He was strong,
and he followed the rules.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.529
The ones painted on the cave walls.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.205
Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad.

02:10.400 --> 02:14.689
Going out at night is bad.
Basically, anything fun is bad.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.842
Welcome to my world.

02:17.000 --> 02:22.404
But this is a story about how
all that changed in an instant.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.723
Because what we didn't know
was that our world...

02:25.880 --> 02:28.406
was about to come to an end.

02:28.560 --> 02:33.851
And there were no rules on our
cave walls to prepare us for that.

02:53.440 --> 02:56.967
You are supposed to wait
for my signal. Eep?

02:59.760 --> 03:01.205
Boo.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.607
Ow! No!

03:08.920 --> 03:11.969
We've been in that cave forever.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.441
Three days is not forever.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.045
It is with this family.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.603
Eep, would you come down here?
You're being so dramatic.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.491
No, Sandy, come back here.

03:24.680 --> 03:28.526
Remember the signal.
Good girls wait for the signal. Ugga.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.479
As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
and you can give the signal.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.130
No, I mean, you're already out now.

03:33.280 --> 03:34.964
I'm waiting for the signal, Dad.

03:35.120 --> 03:37.327
Never mind, Thunk. Just come out.

03:37.480 --> 03:41.121
But if you don't give the signal,
how do I know you're my dad?

03:41.320 --> 03:42.970
The signal isn't so you know it's me.

03:43.160 --> 03:45.970
It's so you know I wasn't eaten
by an animal.

03:46.160 --> 03:50.051
Then why is the signal an animal noise?
Doesn't that just confuse things?

03:50.360 --> 03:53.569
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for the signal.

04:12.160 --> 04:15.084
Mom, we're ready to leave.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.445
Mom?

04:19.519 --> 04:21.887
Still alive.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.451
It's still early.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.331
And you're still fat.

04:26.480 --> 04:28.642
Breakfast formation!

04:29.880 --> 04:33.248
I want to see some real caveman action
out there. We do this fast.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.085
We do this loud.
We do this as a family.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.642
And never not be afraid!

04:58.400 --> 05:00.448
Yay, breakfast.

05:16.560 --> 05:17.561
Who's up?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.607
We'll flip for it.
Call her in the air.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.649
Heads!

05:23.440 --> 05:26.569
Tails. Thunk is in. Positions.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.842
Okay. Thunk...

05:29.000 --> 05:30.411
Go.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.246
Come on, Thunk.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.562
Way to go.
Take it to the cave.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.044
Release the baby!

05:48.520 --> 05:50.249
Get them, Sandy! Go!

06:13.440 --> 06:14.885
Get them, Mom!

06:41.440 --> 06:46.287
Old lady down!
Eep, avenge me!

06:54.800 --> 06:56.040
Thanks.

07:05.320 --> 07:06.526
Eep!

07:06.680 --> 07:08.409
Heads up!

07:46.360 --> 07:48.089
Hey Dad, can we eat now?

07:48.280 --> 07:50.282
Just wait till we get home.

07:50.440 --> 07:52.647
Eep, put on the brakes.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.081
Eep!

08:35.880 --> 08:38.690
- Who is hungry?
- All right! Good one, Dad.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.285
Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.447
- Sorry, Dad.
- Looks like fast food tonight.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.963
That's all right. I ate last week.

09:08.160 --> 09:10.162
Two knuckle warning!

09:10.360 --> 09:12.840
Come on, Croods. Go, go.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.124
Come on, come on. Darkness brings death.
We know this.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.480
The moon is full. Bath night.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.041
- Run for your life!
- You too, Mom.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.441
I don't want to lose
my protective layer.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.204
Mom, you've got ants.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.651
See? Sandy doesn't fuss.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.366
Is she still out there?

09:39.520 --> 09:41.682
You know she hates the cave, Grug.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.251
Please come back tomorrow.

10:09.400 --> 10:12.882
How could she not like the cave?
It's so cozy.

10:13.040 --> 10:16.203
It is a little dark, Grug.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.725
It's not that dark.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.241
Eep!

10:19.880 --> 10:21.120
Eep?

10:43.960 --> 10:47.203
Come on, I have to close the cave.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.241
Eep!

10:51.680 --> 10:53.364
Okay, okay.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.090
Come on.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.161
Eep! Come down!

11:22.280 --> 11:24.851
- That was too close.
- I was watching. I was fine.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.241
- What were you doing up there, Eep?
- I don't know.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.050
- What were you looking for?
- Nothing.

11:29.200 --> 11:30.850
- Then why did you go up there?
- I don't know.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.644
Why don't you know?

11:32.800 --> 11:34.370
Stop looking for things.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.491
Fear keeps us alive, Eep.
Never not be afraid.

11:38.920 --> 11:41.048
What is the point of all this?

11:41.600 --> 11:42.726
What was that?

11:42.880 --> 11:45.804
Why are we here?
What are we doing this for?

11:49.040 --> 11:51.088
No one said survival was fun.

11:51.240 --> 11:52.446
Nothing is fun.

11:52.720 --> 11:54.449
- Would you come down here?
- Grug.

11:54.600 --> 11:55.679
- Eap.
- Grug.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.759
- Yes.
- Off!

11:56.760 --> 11:58.479
- Yes, I know. Okay, I'm trying to...
- Off.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.721
I just don't see why
she needs her own ledge, that's all.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.729
- That's what this is about.
- She's working through some things...

12:02.880 --> 12:04.039
and she needs her own space.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.964
What things?
How long is this going to take?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.811
Really?
She already doesn't listen to me. Hey!

12:09.960 --> 12:11.485
See? She's listening.

12:11.680 --> 12:14.206
If she wants to survive,
she has to follow our rules.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.642
How about a story?
Eep loves those.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.002
That's a good ide...
How about a story, huh?

12:19.160 --> 12:20.844
Yeah, tell us a story.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.002
Okay. Can I borrow that? Thank you.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.050
Eep, your old favorite.

12:28.200 --> 12:30.328
I haven't played with that thing in years.

12:30.520 --> 12:33.171
Tonight we'll hear the story
of Krispy Bear.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.363
A long time ago,
this little bear was alive.

12:37.600 --> 12:40.365
She was alive
because she listened to her father...

12:40.520 --> 12:43.763
and lived her life in routine
and darkness and terror.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.729
So she was happy.

12:46.280 --> 12:50.524
But Krispy had one terrible problem.

12:50.680 --> 12:54.685
She was filled with... curiosity.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.569
- Grug.
- Yes. yes.

12:56.720 --> 12:59.883
And one day, while she was in a tree...

13:00.040 --> 13:03.806
the curious little bear
wanted to climb to the top.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.201
And no sooner than
she climbed to the top...

13:06.360 --> 13:10.206
she saw something new and died!

13:10.360 --> 13:12.203
- Just like that?
- Yes!

13:12.360 --> 13:16.570
Her last moments of terror
still frozen on her face.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.210
Same ending as every day.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.880
I get it, Dad. I will never do
anything new or different.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.326
Good man, Thunk.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.564
All right, everyone
sharpen your teeth, and let's pile up.

18:00.160 --> 18:01.161
Air.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.810
You talk.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.849
I'm a person, like you.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.527
Sort of like you.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.601
Okay, okay.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.841
Hey, hey, hey!

18:15.000 --> 18:16.365
Would you mind not...

18:19.080 --> 18:20.206
That tickles.

18:20.360 --> 18:21.964
Hey, hey, hey!

18:24.920 --> 18:25.921
Quiet!

18:26.040 --> 18:28.202
I'm not supposed to be out here.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.001
Eep is gone.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.207
What? Grug!

18:43.360 --> 18:44.486
Stay in the cave.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.848
Wow. You are really strong.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.485
Hey! No! It's mine.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.369
- Please! Wait.
- No!

19:04.520 --> 19:06.399
- It's dying! I can fix it!
- No! I caught it!

19:06.400 --> 19:07.765
Please! Please.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.206
I hate the dark.

19:19.160 --> 19:20.969
Come on, come on, come on.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.567
It does what you tell it?

19:25.720 --> 19:28.041
Yeah. Sort of.

19:28.200 --> 19:29.201
The sun?

19:29.720 --> 19:32.121
No, no, no. Fire.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.647
Hi, fire.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.488
It's not alive.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.529
But you said it was dying.

19:43.440 --> 19:44.601
Sorry.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.009
It comes from where you come from?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.248
No. No, I make it.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.119
- Make some for me.
- Okay.

19:51.120 --> 19:52.159
Make!

19:52.160 --> 19:53.241
It doesn't come out of me.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.209
Make! Make it!

19:56.760 --> 19:59.206
You do this a lot.

20:01.040 --> 20:02.883
Are you dead?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.122
Can I have your fire if you're dead?

20:09.320 --> 20:10.526
Clear!

20:10.880 --> 20:12.530
Hey, those are cold!

20:12.680 --> 20:15.206
You think? Listening shells, activate.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.201
I concur.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.602
Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.043
I don't even know you.

20:23.680 --> 20:24.681
I'm Guy.

20:24.840 --> 20:25.841
Guy?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.606
And this is Belt.
Cook, conversationalist, navigator.

20:29.280 --> 20:30.930
Also, keeps my pants up.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.005
What are "pants up"?

20:33.160 --> 20:34.491
Who are you?

20:35.120 --> 20:36.121
Eep.

20:36.280 --> 20:38.362
Let me clarify, Eep.
The world is ending.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.599
What?

20:39.600 --> 20:41.841
I'm calling it "The End."

20:45.120 --> 20:46.360
How do you know?

20:46.520 --> 20:48.000
I have seen it. It's coming this way.

20:48.120 --> 20:51.602
First, the ground is going to shake.
Then it breaks open. Everything falls in.

20:51.760 --> 20:52.921
Fire. Lava.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.760
I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but...

20:56.960 --> 21:00.681
Believe me, everything we are
standing on will be gone.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.968
We got to get to high ground.
I know a mountain, that way.

21:03.120 --> 21:04.804
It's our only chance.

21:05.520 --> 21:06.726
Come with me.

21:08.960 --> 21:11.281
I can't.

21:11.720 --> 21:12.767
Okay.

21:14.800 --> 21:15.961
Here.

21:20.080 --> 21:23.004
If you survive, call me.

21:28.280 --> 21:29.725
Thank you.

21:30.520 --> 21:31.851
Hello?

21:32.400 --> 21:33.640
Hey!

21:35.800 --> 21:36.879
Dad!

21:36.880 --> 21:38.530
Are you hurt? What took you?

21:38.680 --> 21:41.047
Nothing. I left on my own.

21:41.440 --> 21:43.488
You what?

21:43.640 --> 21:45.768
Dad, let me explain.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.724
You never let me talk.

21:54.880 --> 21:56.723
You're grounded.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.441
Hey!

22:03.440 --> 22:04.487
Eep!

22:04.640 --> 22:05.801
Mom.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.401
Grug! What happened?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.848
You know what, I am so mad right now
that I can't talk to her.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.167
Eep?

22:12.320 --> 22:15.399
You will never believe it.
I found something new.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.401
New!

22:16.520 --> 22:17.681
New is a big problem!

22:17.840 --> 22:18.841
Wait, wait!

22:19.000 --> 22:20.729
Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.803
- It wasn't bad.
-"New" is always bad.

22:22.960 --> 22:24.371
No. He was nice.

22:24.520 --> 22:26.488
What? Excuse me? He?

22:26.640 --> 22:30.645
I thought he was a warthog,
but then he turned into a boy.

22:30.800 --> 22:31.801
Strange.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.849
Usually it's the reverse.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.361
Eep's got a boy hog. Eep's got a boy...

22:36.800 --> 22:38.006
There was a boy.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.049
Watch. I'm going to call him.

22:56.720 --> 22:59.087
What is wrong with you?

22:59.240 --> 23:00.241
It was dangerous.

23:00.440 --> 23:02.283
It was beautiful!

23:02.480 --> 23:04.562
You want to see dangerous? Here!

23:06.040 --> 23:07.121
My sniffer!

23:07.320 --> 23:08.439
Okay, that's it!

23:08.440 --> 23:09.851
We're going back to the cave...

23:10.000 --> 23:12.526
and you're going to stay in there
until you're older than...

23:14.080 --> 23:15.159
her!

23:15.160 --> 23:16.241
What!

23:16.960 --> 23:19.725
You can't keep me inside forever!

23:31.200 --> 23:32.804
He said this would happen.

23:38.840 --> 23:40.410
Get to the cave!

23:42.200 --> 23:43.281
Go!

24:14.040 --> 24:15.371
Look out!

24:16.680 --> 24:17.681
Stop!

24:57.120 --> 24:58.485
Is everyone okay?

24:58.680 --> 24:59.886
Yes.

25:00.400 --> 25:03.563
Grug, the cave...

25:03.720 --> 25:05.370
it's gone.

25:07.600 --> 25:08.840
No.

25:44.640 --> 25:47.962
You really need to see this.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.481
We should go there!

26:05.640 --> 26:08.723
No. No one is going anywhere.

26:11.600 --> 26:13.682
What else did that boy say?

26:38.520 --> 26:39.521
Grug?

26:40.240 --> 26:41.685
Just go! Just go!

26:41.840 --> 26:42.887
Go!

27:02.240 --> 27:06.370
One, two, three, four, five...

27:09.760 --> 27:11.046
Six.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.803
Where are we?

27:13.960 --> 27:16.122
I don't know. I'm not sure.

27:16.320 --> 27:18.049
Down.

27:18.240 --> 27:20.481
In a lower place.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.928
But one thing is for sure,
we can't go back the way we came.

27:25.360 --> 27:27.601
Sandy? What is it?

27:29.160 --> 27:31.401
No, no, no. Wait. Come back, Sandy!

27:38.440 --> 27:41.046
We can't be out in the open like this.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.929
We need a cave.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.845
Now, step where I step.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.170
Okay. Stay quiet.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.800
Hopefully, nothing big
knows we're here yet.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.766
Wait.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.286
Okay.

28:06.440 --> 28:07.487
Wait.

28:08.240 --> 28:09.605
Okay.

28:09.760 --> 28:10.841
Wait!

28:16.000 --> 28:17.081
Wait.

28:19.800 --> 28:20.961
Okay.

28:21.120 --> 28:22.201
Wait.

28:26.360 --> 28:27.361
Wait.

28:37.560 --> 28:38.607
<i>So, Dad...</i>

28:38.960 --> 28:42.521
just to be clear, are we looking for
the exact same cave?

28:42.680 --> 28:45.160
If it was me...
I'm just throwing this out there...

28:45.320 --> 28:47.721
if it was me choosing the cave...

28:50.440 --> 28:53.046
I would go with a smaller cave.

28:54.560 --> 28:55.561
Wait.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.441
Dad?

29:00.800 --> 29:02.450
I'll take care of this.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.720
All right, Dad, get them! Go get them!

29:14.240 --> 29:15.605
Now you got them right...

29:15.760 --> 29:16.886
Man, they're really...

29:17.040 --> 29:18.405
I'm loving this.

29:19.360 --> 29:20.361
Dad, I got it.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.045
Just stop running into their fists.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.171
Grug, when you're done,
we should get going.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.530
That's right. You can't get past this!

29:55.000 --> 29:56.650
Climb! Climb! Climb!

30:05.720 --> 30:06.759
Cave!

30:06.760 --> 30:07.966
Go! Go!

30:08.360 --> 30:10.727
Come on! Hurry up. Let's go.

30:13.040 --> 30:16.010
Look! This cave has a tongue. Awesome!

30:32.320 --> 30:33.890
Okay.

30:34.040 --> 30:38.125
That's one, two, three, four, five, six.

30:38.280 --> 30:40.009
And seven...

30:40.160 --> 30:43.482
if we're counting Chunky the Death Cat.

30:53.960 --> 30:56.042
It's scared of the dark.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.651
Wait, we're scared of the dark.

31:36.560 --> 31:37.891
Kill circle!

31:48.080 --> 31:49.081
Eep!

32:09.960 --> 32:10.961
Eep!

33:10.920 --> 33:12.490
- Cavies!
-"Cavies"?

33:12.640 --> 33:15.166
Cavemen! Stand back!
They're practically animals.

33:15.320 --> 33:17.926
- You see their bony, sloping foreheads?
- Yeah.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.606
The huge primitive teeth?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.041
Yeah.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.770
The excessive body hair.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.366
That one has got a tail.

33:25.480 --> 33:26.559
Yeah.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.245
All right. Close your eyes.
I'm going to have to take their lives.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.284
No! It won't help.
They're my family.

33:32.440 --> 33:33.441
What?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.371
The sun is in his hands!

33:36.520 --> 33:38.921
No, no. It's "fire."

33:39.120 --> 33:40.406
Where did it come from?

33:40.560 --> 33:41.925
He made it.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.121
Make some for me!

33:43.280 --> 33:44.566
It doesn't come out of him.

33:44.720 --> 33:46.210
Make. Make it!

33:47.680 --> 33:50.126
You're a lot like your daughter.

33:50.280 --> 33:51.805
Great, now he's broken.

33:51.960 --> 33:53.689
It's a baby sun.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.806
Hey, stay back.
We don't know what it wants.

33:56.960 --> 33:59.804
Now, we'll all sit here
and wait for the sun to come back.

33:59.960 --> 34:02.361
And tomorrow we'll find a new cave...

34:02.560 --> 34:05.211
and pretend today never happened.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.646
Isn't this fun, Eep?

34:06.800 --> 34:08.085
Eep, don't touch him.

34:08.239 --> 34:09.571
Goodness knows where he's been.

34:09.719 --> 34:11.643
Dad, Sandy is hurting fire.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.641
Sandy, no. Fire is not a plaything.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.810
What a cute little guy.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.768
Hey. Stay back.

34:20.840 --> 34:22.763
No, no, no, wait!

34:25.760 --> 34:26.966
It likes me.

34:27.120 --> 34:28.485
Hey! It's biting me!

34:30.520 --> 34:34.047
Thunk! Try hiding from it
in the tall, dry grass!

34:37.639 --> 34:39.688
No, stop. Please, I'm only nine.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.841
They're biting me!

34:44.440 --> 34:45.851
More fire babies.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.199
Hi.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.328
So, your dad, he is trying to kill me.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.284
Yeah. But I won't let him.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.005
Hold on, son. Come back!

34:57.560 --> 34:59.005
No, stop! Let me go!

35:00.320 --> 35:02.368
Get out! Out! Out!

35:02.520 --> 35:04.409
Eat up, babies!

35:05.240 --> 35:07.083
No, stop touching me!

35:08.200 --> 35:09.201
Die!

35:11.480 --> 35:13.244
I win!

35:19.920 --> 35:22.491
They're not so scary
once you get to know them.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.202
Who are you people?

35:26.360 --> 35:27.771
I'm sorry.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.161
We're the Croods!

35:30.440 --> 35:31.680
And you are?

35:32.440 --> 35:33.519
Guy.

35:33.520 --> 35:34.885
Hi, Guy.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.487
Wow!

35:50.080 --> 35:51.684
It looks like magic.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.081
And smells like food.

35:59.880 --> 36:02.884
No, don't eat it, it's new.

36:06.880 --> 36:08.291
Still alive!

36:08.440 --> 36:10.363
Come on, keep eating.

36:13.960 --> 36:15.644
Hey, where is Guy?

36:22.280 --> 36:23.281
No!

36:23.440 --> 36:24.441
Going somewhere?

36:24.600 --> 36:27.126
The mountain? High ground?
End of the world, remember?

36:27.280 --> 36:30.284
That already happened.
It destroyed our cave.

36:30.440 --> 36:32.807
No. That was just the beginning of the end.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.446
The end of the end is still coming.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.728
Eep. Drop it.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.444
We can't let him go!

36:42.600 --> 36:45.809
What if we don't find a
cave before sunset?

36:45.960 --> 36:47.689
What if it takes a few days?

36:48.400 --> 36:50.767
What if the birds come back?

36:52.320 --> 36:55.324
We need his fire, dummy!

36:56.320 --> 36:59.483
Fine. You're staying with us
until we find a cave.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.689
What? No, I'm not.
Don't make me a part of this!

37:03.120 --> 37:04.724
Stay here if you want, but let me go.

37:04.880 --> 37:06.006
I've got a dream...

37:06.200 --> 37:08.248
a mission, a reason to live!

37:08.400 --> 37:09.526
Not anymore.

37:09.680 --> 37:11.364
I've got an idea.

37:11.520 --> 37:13.488
Let's go to that mountain.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.641
It's too far.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.644
Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.241
There are caves on that mountain.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.640
Have you been there?

37:22.840 --> 37:23.887
It's a mountain.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.361
Mountains are safe.
Mountains have caves.

37:26.520 --> 37:28.522
And water. And sticks.

37:28.720 --> 37:31.246
Mom? Did you hear that?
I can get my own stick!

37:31.400 --> 37:33.846
Yes. Sticks and caves.
Caves and sticks.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.161
Crazy sticks. Let's go.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.161
Quiet!

37:47.720 --> 37:49.131
That thing is weird.

37:51.200 --> 37:53.089
No, no, no. It's okay, Sandy.

37:53.240 --> 37:54.605
That's just Belt.

37:58.600 --> 37:59.931
I've made a decision.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.560
We're going to that mountain.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.242
Don't ask me why. Just a hunch.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.084
Just feels right.

38:07.240 --> 38:10.369
I don't know, Grug.
We've never really walked that far.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.568
I don't think my feet can do that.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.371
I'll never live long enough to get there.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.725
Let's do it.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.608
Come on, just think.

38:20.760 --> 38:24.765
Our whole family packed together
on a long, slow, trip across country?

38:24.920 --> 38:26.843
Days and nights with just each other.

38:27.000 --> 38:28.729
We'll tell stories. We'll laugh.

38:30.240 --> 38:33.289
We'll become closer as a family.

38:35.440 --> 38:36.441
Get her off!

38:36.600 --> 38:38.682
If you're not ready to challenge her,
then don't look her in the eye.

38:38.840 --> 38:41.889
Could you keep your big giant arms
on your side of the trail?

38:42.360 --> 38:45.682
Isn't this fun?
We're taking our first trip together.

38:46.400 --> 38:48.239
Stop shoving,
or I will pull out your tongue!

38:48.240 --> 38:50.402
Do you want me to
turn this family around? Do you?

38:50.560 --> 38:53.245
Because I will
turn this family around so fast!

38:53.400 --> 38:55.050
Dad, I gotta go!

38:55.200 --> 38:57.282
- Come on, you can hold it.
- I don't think so.

38:57.480 --> 38:58.641
Sandy, take that out of your mouth.

38:58.800 --> 38:59.926
- I'm touching...
- Gran.

39:00.080 --> 39:02.560
Dad, I still gotta go!

39:02.720 --> 39:05.564
Fine. Just go behind one of those
lumpy things and make it fast.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.883
- Something bit me!
- I don't blame it.

39:08.040 --> 39:10.599
Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?

39:10.600 --> 39:11.679
No.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.205
- How about now?
- No.

39:13.320 --> 39:14.679
- Now?
- No.

39:14.680 --> 39:15.759
Now?

39:15.760 --> 39:18.001
I can do this all day long.

39:18.160 --> 39:21.448
No, no, no and still no.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.762
I'm not dying on an empty stomach.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.281
Grug, we're all pretty tired!

39:26.440 --> 39:27.805
We'll eat when we get there.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.405
It's taking too long!

39:29.560 --> 39:31.289
I'm grabbing a snack.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.884
Don't do that. He will cut you.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.963
That's not food, he's a pet. My pet.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.201
What's a pet?

39:37.360 --> 39:39.124
An animal you don't eat.

39:39.280 --> 39:41.282
We call those "children."

39:42.600 --> 39:46.127
No man should have a pet.
It's weird and wrong.

39:46.960 --> 39:48.803
- It's food!
- No, please!

39:48.960 --> 39:50.724
Not that. That!

39:52.320 --> 39:53.810
Food fixes everything.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.485
Show me your hunting face.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.485
Not you. You're still grounded.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.971
Come on, Thunk.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.770
My feet hurt.

40:09.160 --> 40:10.844
- You look tense.
- I'm not tense.

40:11.400 --> 40:14.483
Angry girl wants to be doing
what they're doing.

40:15.280 --> 40:16.486
I wasn't ready.

40:17.760 --> 40:19.524
Hang on, Thunk, I'm coming!

40:19.800 --> 40:21.529
Why are you doing this?

40:22.800 --> 40:24.006
What are they doing?

40:24.160 --> 40:25.366
Hunting.

40:25.520 --> 40:27.522
Get it off! You stay away from me.

40:27.680 --> 40:28.841
No, seriously, what are they doing?

40:29.000 --> 40:32.004
You've got a ton of eggs.
Just make another egg.

40:47.040 --> 40:49.042
Now you're just rubbing it in.

40:50.360 --> 40:53.489
There, who's hungry for scorpion?

40:55.640 --> 40:58.120
What happened to the egg and the bird?

40:58.720 --> 40:59.881
We lost him.

41:00.040 --> 41:02.691
But when the bird stepped on me
and pushed me into the ground...

41:02.840 --> 41:04.922
the scorpion grabbed a hold of me...

41:05.080 --> 41:07.401
and one thing led to another
and here we are eating him.

41:07.560 --> 41:08.607
So, win-win.

41:08.760 --> 41:11.411
Not enough. Not enough!
I need more.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.370
I need more.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.411
Look at that.
She's not going to eat me, right?

41:17.560 --> 41:18.561
You're too skinny.

41:18.720 --> 41:20.768
If she was going to eat anyone
it would be...

41:21.520 --> 41:22.639
Mom!

41:22.640 --> 41:24.244
She's locked her jaw!

41:24.400 --> 41:26.209
Get a stick! Get a stick!

41:28.040 --> 41:29.246
Stay away!

41:29.560 --> 41:31.210
You sick old monster!

41:31.360 --> 41:33.169
Hurry! Put the stick in her mouth!

41:34.720 --> 41:36.324
Hold her still. Use a rock.

41:38.160 --> 41:40.367
Ugga, would you just hit her legs?

41:41.480 --> 41:42.766
Why are you rolling away?

41:42.920 --> 41:44.922
I just want something to eat.

41:45.080 --> 41:48.243
You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!

41:48.440 --> 41:49.441
Please.

41:50.400 --> 41:51.845
I'll let you help me hunt.

41:52.000 --> 41:53.081
Really?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.360
Don't wait on me. They're all over me.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.045
Tell my story.

42:04.840 --> 42:06.205
Okay.

42:07.280 --> 42:08.361
What do you call this?

42:08.520 --> 42:09.726
A trap.

42:09.920 --> 42:11.046
What does it do?

42:11.200 --> 42:12.201
Well...

42:21.080 --> 42:23.128
How long have you been alone?

42:27.040 --> 42:29.566
So, what do we do?

42:30.800 --> 42:32.450
How's your acting?

42:58.120 --> 42:59.326
You're good at this.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.130
No. Sorry.

43:05.280 --> 43:06.441
Okay.

43:06.640 --> 43:08.324
- Yeah, that's yours.
- Excuse me.

43:09.680 --> 43:11.011
Your other hand...

43:11.160 --> 43:13.561
- That's my arm.
- Okay, I'm moving it.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.725
Going under.

43:24.360 --> 43:27.648
It didn't step in your trap-y thing.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.246
Yeah, I noticed!

43:34.520 --> 43:35.646
Where's Eep?

43:42.240 --> 43:43.810
She's awesome.

43:45.120 --> 43:46.201
Eep!

43:46.920 --> 43:47.967
Dad,no!

43:59.640 --> 44:01.608
It's an avalanche of flavor.

44:29.520 --> 44:31.522
Looks like we won't be
having any leftovers.

44:31.680 --> 44:33.603
What are "left overs"?

44:33.760 --> 44:36.080
When you have so much food to eat,
you have some left over.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.602
We never have that much food.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.208
Grug, how about a story?

44:53.360 --> 44:55.727
That's a good idea. How about a story?

44:56.240 --> 44:58.163
Yeah, tell us a story!

45:00.840 --> 45:04.367
Once upon a time,
there was a little tiger...

45:04.520 --> 45:07.091
who lived in a cave with her family.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.446
There were a lot of rules...

45:08.640 --> 45:13.567
but the big, simple one
was to never leave the cave at night.

45:13.720 --> 45:18.521
And the door was so heavy,
you'd think it would be easy to remember.

45:18.680 --> 45:19.966
So easy to remember!

45:20.120 --> 45:21.360
I know.

45:22.160 --> 45:24.447
But, while everyone was asleep...

45:24.600 --> 45:25.965
she went out anyway.

45:26.160 --> 45:27.605
- No!
- Yes!

45:27.760 --> 45:30.525
And no sooner than she did,
their cave was destroyed...

45:30.680 --> 45:33.286
and everyone had to go
on this long, sucky walk...

45:33.440 --> 45:35.204
with some weirdo they met...

45:35.360 --> 45:36.805
and die!

45:38.840 --> 45:40.046
The end.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.728
I did not see that coming. Twist ending.

45:44.880 --> 45:46.484
My stories never end like that.

45:46.680 --> 45:48.489
Yes! Two stories in one night!

45:57.640 --> 46:01.247
Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.210
Once upon a time,
there was a beautiful tiger.

46:09.360 --> 46:12.284
She lived in a cave
with the rest of her family.

46:12.440 --> 46:16.206
Her father and mother told her,
"You may go anywhere you want..."

46:16.360 --> 46:19.921
"but never go near the cliff,
for you could fall."

46:20.080 --> 46:22.651
And die. Good story.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.282
But when no one was looking...

46:27.480 --> 46:29.801
she'd go near the cliff...

46:29.960 --> 46:31.883
for the closer she came to the edge...

46:32.040 --> 46:35.487
the more she could hear,
the more she could see...

46:35.640 --> 46:37.563
the more she could feel.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.966
Finally...

46:41.120 --> 46:44.329
she stood at the very edge.

46:44.480 --> 46:46.244
She saw a light.

46:46.400 --> 46:49.483
She leaned out to touch it...

46:50.040 --> 46:51.201
and she slipped.

46:51.520 --> 46:52.885
And she fell.

46:53.080 --> 46:54.969
And she flew.

46:57.280 --> 46:58.691
Where did she fly?

46:59.120 --> 47:00.281
Tomorrow.

47:00.440 --> 47:01.566
Tomorrow?

47:01.720 --> 47:04.610
A place with more suns in the sky
than you can count.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.165
It would be so bright.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.085
A place not like today, or yesterday.

47:09.240 --> 47:12.050
A place where things are better.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.689
Tomorrow isn't a place.

47:16.720 --> 47:18.051
You can't see it!

47:18.200 --> 47:20.089
Yes, it is.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.171
I've seen it.

47:25.000 --> 47:26.889
That's where I'm going.

47:36.240 --> 47:40.245
We are going to shut our eyes and sleep.

47:40.680 --> 47:41.841
And when we wake up...

47:42.040 --> 47:44.399
we're going to find the place
that has everything we want.

47:44.400 --> 47:45.519
Tomorrow?

47:45.520 --> 47:46.851
A cave.

48:25.920 --> 48:27.729
That was too close. it almost caught us.

48:27.920 --> 48:29.684
I was watching. We were fine.

48:29.880 --> 48:31.006
We gotta move faster.

48:31.160 --> 48:34.209
Do you people have any other speed
aside from "wander"?

48:34.360 --> 48:36.408
I'll take a shamble at this point.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.409
Hey, do you have a minute?

48:38.600 --> 48:40.409
How did the tiger fly?

48:40.600 --> 48:43.001
I only share when I'm outside the log.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.525
I'm funny that way.

48:44.680 --> 48:47.684
Leave this to me.

48:48.600 --> 48:49.886
Hey, Thunk...

48:50.040 --> 48:52.008
you have a spider on your face.

48:54.200 --> 48:55.361
Oops.

48:55.680 --> 48:57.125
He's loose!

49:01.920 --> 49:05.447
Do not step on those weird pointy rocks.

49:05.600 --> 49:06.886
Do you mean these rocks?

49:08.040 --> 49:09.883
Do not step on these rocks!

49:10.040 --> 49:11.769
Step aside, girls.

49:14.080 --> 49:17.050
Hello? Nobody's listening!
No one is listening.

49:17.200 --> 49:20.044
You cannot walk on those!

49:32.920 --> 49:34.081
Get back here now!

49:34.720 --> 49:37.405
There goes our chance for survival.

49:37.560 --> 49:39.403
And our log!

49:40.400 --> 49:41.401
Okay.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.604
Jumping doesn't help. It does briefly...

50:04.760 --> 50:06.091
but it doesn't get better.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.411
How about...

50:09.560 --> 50:12.086
Don't walk on your hands.
The hands do not help at all.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.130
Come on.

50:23.120 --> 50:24.451
I can help you...

50:24.600 --> 50:27.126
but we're going to have to
make a few changes around here.

50:27.280 --> 50:29.282
The log ride is over.

50:29.440 --> 50:30.771
Drop the log.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.128
Now, kick it away.

50:40.280 --> 50:41.770
Farther.

50:46.480 --> 50:47.641
Really?

50:48.320 --> 50:51.529
Okay, smart "Guy"...

50:51.680 --> 50:52.966
now what?

51:07.640 --> 51:09.688
Good fish, good fish.

51:13.200 --> 51:15.851
Okay. Now you can look.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.646
I love them!
Where are my feet?

51:22.800 --> 51:24.006
They're still there!

51:25.120 --> 51:26.121
Okay.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.720
You're really heavy.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.006
Really?

51:31.160 --> 51:32.321
Thank you!

51:33.360 --> 51:35.010
Hey. Wait!

51:38.360 --> 51:39.646
Okay.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.529
She's up. We're good. I'm good.

51:41.680 --> 51:45.321
These shoes are great!
Where do you get these ideas?

51:49.320 --> 51:51.402
I'm calling it a "brain."

51:51.560 --> 51:53.881
I'm pretty sure it's
where ideas come from.

51:54.040 --> 51:57.089
Dad, I don't have a brain.

51:57.360 --> 52:00.523
We've gotten along just fine
without brains until now.

52:00.720 --> 52:03.883
Cavemen don't need brains.
We have these.

52:04.880 --> 52:08.327
That's what I'm talking about!
Ideas are for weaklings.

52:08.520 --> 52:10.727
Now, let's get to that mountain!

52:13.880 --> 52:16.042
Wow! I love those!

52:16.200 --> 52:18.407
Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

52:55.240 --> 52:58.050
So, how did the tiger fly?

52:58.200 --> 53:00.043
She jumped on the sun...

53:00.200 --> 53:01.929
and rode it to Tomorrow.

53:03.880 --> 53:05.882
No,no,no.

53:38.520 --> 53:39.521
Hi, Dad!

53:40.840 --> 53:42.490
Bye. Dad!

53:47.320 --> 53:49.846
You've seen rain before, right?

53:50.000 --> 53:52.287
We don't get out much.

54:13.320 --> 54:14.845
Eep, looks dangerous.

54:15.800 --> 54:18.041
Dad, you say that about everything.

54:18.200 --> 54:19.201
Careful.

54:19.400 --> 54:20.686
Really? Okay.

54:54.880 --> 54:57.724
No, no, no. Not cool!

55:18.240 --> 55:22.086
So, the bear says, "Your cave? I've been
dumping my bones here since last week."

55:22.280 --> 55:23.406
Last week!

55:24.360 --> 55:25.885
That's a funny story!

55:26.040 --> 55:28.122
It's not a story. It's a joke.

55:28.280 --> 55:29.566
What's a "joke"?

55:29.760 --> 55:32.764
Just making something up
to make you laugh.

55:37.960 --> 55:39.121
- One for you.
- Thanks.

55:39.280 --> 55:42.250
One for you. And this one's for you.

55:42.960 --> 55:43.961
Okay.

55:44.120 --> 55:45.963
Okay! That's enough!

55:47.440 --> 55:49.442
I don't see why the kids
need their own shells.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.680
So if anyone gets in trouble,
we can call the others.

55:51.800 --> 55:54.610
Wait, you're saying we should split up?

55:54.760 --> 55:57.764
We can try more paths at once.
It's the fastest way through.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.446
Croods stick together.
Your way isn't safe.

56:00.600 --> 56:01.601
They can handle it.

56:01.760 --> 56:03.000
We can do it, Dad.

56:03.160 --> 56:04.764
No,no,no.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.962
It's my job to keep you safe.

56:07.120 --> 56:10.442
I'm still in charge
and we are not splitting up.

56:11.120 --> 56:12.246
Except for you two.

56:12.960 --> 56:14.291
And that's final.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.610
Hello?

56:35.760 --> 56:37.728
Is everyone all right?

56:37.880 --> 56:39.166
We're okay, Grug.

56:39.320 --> 56:41.402
Dad? I'm freaking out a little bit.

56:41.560 --> 56:44.131
Just tell me what to do.
What do I do? What do I do right now?

56:44.280 --> 56:46.169
Stay where you are. I'll find you.

56:46.320 --> 56:47.924
No. Too slow.

56:48.080 --> 56:51.004
Everybody, keep moving forward
and we'll get out.

56:51.160 --> 56:52.161
Dad?

56:54.160 --> 56:55.685
Yeah.

56:55.840 --> 56:57.205
Okay.

56:57.360 --> 56:59.840
Remember, never not be afraid.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.889
You can do this!

57:02.040 --> 57:04.202
It's going to be okay,
it's going to be okay.

57:04.360 --> 57:06.522
I'm going to pass out.

57:08.200 --> 57:10.123
Sandy. Sandy!

58:59.840 --> 59:01.444
Give me another one.

59:05.040 --> 59:06.405
You dropped these.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.565
Come with me.

59:44.480 --> 59:46.164
Here, boy! Catch!

59:48.520 --> 59:49.931
Yoo-hoo!

59:50.080 --> 59:51.320
Gran?

59:53.880 --> 59:54.881
Mom?

59:55.040 --> 59:56.530
Wow.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.451
Grug?

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.044
I'll go get him.

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:17.521
Good boy! Who's a good boy?

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.728
You are! Yes, you are! Look at you!

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:21.689
You need a name. You want a name?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.524
I'm going to call you Douglas.

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.007
Can you do tricks? Roll over.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.049
Come on, Douglas, roll over.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:35.042
Good boy, Douglas!

01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:40.370
I was in love once.

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:43.364
He was a hunter. I was a gatherer.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.921
It was quite a scandal.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.088
We fed each other berries, we danced.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:53.562
Then my father smashed him with a rock
and traded me to your grandfather.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.970
Croods!

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.406
Get down here.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.370
Grug, they're okay. Guy is with them.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:07.127
Guy is with them. Okay.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.721
Thank you.

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.771
Thank you for bringing me
that interesting Guy update.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.884
Okay. I'm going to go up...

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:19.728
and why don't you join us
when you stop being a big drag!

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.490
Sleep pile?

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.484
How about a story?

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.451
Anyone?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.085
And then Torg said,
"Know it? I drew it."

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.643
That makes no sense.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:54.483
I know it was hard for you
to bring us along...

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.530
but they had the
best day of their lives.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:01.320
Thank you for that.

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:26.171
I want to show you something.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.881
More suns in the sky than you can count.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:13.730
Every sun that crosses our sky
comes to rest up there.

01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:15.723
Tomorrow.

01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:17.723
That's where we'll be safe.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:20.403
I'm going with Guy.

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:23.246
No. Not my little girl.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.364
Come with us.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.245
I can't go without Grug.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:34.085
That makes one of us. Count me in.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.890
Really, Mom? Now?

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.287
Grug has no idea how to protect us.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.568
In fact, he has no ideas at all!

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:43.724
No, that's not true.
What about that one time when he...

01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.206
Face it.

01:03:47.360 --> 01:03:50.409
If he actually had an idea of his own...

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.767
I'd have a heart attack and die!

01:03:58.240 --> 01:03:59.241
Grug?

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.566
- Dad!
- Dad!

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.883
He's a big guy. How could he
just disappear like that?

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.806
Hey, wait! Let's ask that ugly lady
if she's seen Dad.

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.131
Haven't seen him.

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.644
What are you doing?

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:13.879
Yeah.

01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.601
I was up all night, because
all these ideas just kept coming to me.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.410
Is that a snake?

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:21.608
Belt, new and improved.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.086
It's even self-tightening!

01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.969
What is that on your head?

01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.088
It's called desperation.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:33.641
I call it a "rug." Rhymes with "Grug."

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.804
And this one, I call it a "ride."

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.121
Rhymes with "Grug."

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.281
That doesn't rhyme...

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.807
It's going to get us
places faster than shoes.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.489
Yeah! Try to keep up!

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:52.483
I wish I had a ride.

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.206
And painting is a thing of the past.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.806
I call this a "snapshot."

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.201
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.767
I call them "shades."

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.883
The sun doesn't hurt my eyes anymore.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.849
Where do you get these great ideas?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.286
Since I don't have a brain...

01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.841
they're coming from my stomach,
down deep below...

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.162
and then up again into my mind.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.002
Grug, we have to keep moving.

01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:22.971
See, I got ideas. I got thoughts.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:26.124
Like this. I call it a "mobile home."

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.009
Isn't that something?

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.719
And I'm calling this one a "lifterator."

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.799
Mom?

01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:35.961
I know. It's bad.

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:42.168
I almost feel sorry for him.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.525
No, I don't.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.362
What are you trying to do, Grug?

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:55.525
See, I thought if I could have ideas...

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.171
like Guy...

01:05:58.040 --> 01:06:00.168
maybe Eep would listen to me.

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.041
And maybe she wouldn't
want to go with Guy.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.565
Grug.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.200
Is that what this is all about?

01:06:11.560 --> 01:06:14.769
And I also thought
it would kill your mother.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.400
So win-win.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.005
We're here!

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.290
Wow.

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.639
Cave!

01:06:58.640 --> 01:06:59.641
Everyone inside.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.926
Hurry up. Let's go.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.326
Let's go. Go!

01:07:04.600 --> 01:07:05.726
No!

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.965
No more caves, Grug.

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.239
What?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:14.926
We're going to jump on the sun
and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy!

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.401
Wait. So you're all going to do this?

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.167
Thunk?

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:23.170
Sorry, Dad.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.281
You have to stop worrying for all of us.

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:30.165
It's my job to worry!
It's my job to follow the rules!

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.163
The rules don't work out here!

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.521
They kept us alive!

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.765
That wasn't living!
That was just not dying.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:39.285
There's a difference.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.966
Ugga, everyone,
you have to listen to me.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:45.209
We would be dead if we listened to you!

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.762
We have to follow Guy now.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:54.201
Guy.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.371
Guy? Run.

01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:07.321
This is pointless!

01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:09.284
We're running out of time.
Everything is collapsing.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.528
You're being irrational
and counterproductive!

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.011
Big words anger me!

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:14.721
Keep talking.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.120
Countermeasures!

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:19.884
You remember how you were
this morning? You changed.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.804
Idea man. Modern man.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.524
I am a caveman!

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:26.886
No, no, no, wait!

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:49.359
No!

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.363
What is this stuff that saves you
from my punches?

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:54.839
Tar.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:57.207
No. I have to get back to them.

01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:59.118
Stop struggling.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:00.121
No!

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.241
Grug, stop!

01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:10.567
No one gets out of this.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.568
Believe me...

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:15.210
I know.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:17.401
Your...

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:20.245
Family. Yeah.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.964
Sorry.

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.765
I was little when it happened.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.206
Last thing my parents told me was...

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:38.731
"Don't hide."

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.090
"Live."

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.287
"Follow the sun."

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:47.568
"You'll make it to Tomorrow."

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.921
You followed the light.

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:54.722
My daughter is a lot like you.

01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.927
No.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:57.605
She's like you.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.809
She loves you,
but always forgets to say it.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:03.486
Just like you forget to tell her.

01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.691
I guess I was just busy
keeping them all alive.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:15.607
It's okay. That's what dads do.

01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.090
That's right.

01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:27.487
But we can't do that from here.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:30.325
We need one of your ideas.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:36.004
Come on. You can do it.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:43.324
Belt! Emergency Idea Generator, activate!

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.126
I've got it.

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.319
Wow.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.290
Yeah, I know. But he's doing
the best with what he has.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.641
Let's go.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.684
There he is.

01:11:05.840 --> 01:11:08.571
Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity.

01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:09.721
Move me.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.205
Okay, he sees us.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.681
That's our cue. Now, work it!

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.240
He's not coming over.

01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.199
I don't think our puppet
looks scared enough.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.567
Scared? I'll show you scared.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.324
Hand me those acting sticks!

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.404
Hold on!

01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.122
Yes! You did it.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.201
- Grug!
- Dad!

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.607
Hey! We're okay!

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.445
Yeah.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:36.930
We're okay.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:51.451
Grug, your call.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.568
Take us to Tomorrow.

01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:01.966
Hurry!

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.327
Come on! We're going to make it!

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.530
You were right.

01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:10.126
There it is! The sun!

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.483
We can do it!
We can ride it to Tomorrow!

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.641
Run!

01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.041
I don't understand.

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.249
The sun was right here.
It was right here.

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:18.484
We have to go back to the cave.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:20.045
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:23.363
Stay together. Let's keep moving.
Move, move, move.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.005
Everybody, hold my hand.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.766
Thunk, let's go. Go, go, go.
Let's stay together.

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.048
Grug. What's wrong with you?

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.283
Grug, we'll die if we stay here!

01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.048
Grug, listen to me.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.885
We've got to get back to that cave.

01:15:06.240 --> 01:15:08.208
No more dark.

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.127
No more hiding.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.608
No more caves.

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:17.282
What's the point of all this?

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.767
To follow the light.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.124
I can't change.

01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:31.442
I don't have ideas.

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.567
But I have my strength.

01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:36.085
And right now...

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.561
that's all you need.

01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.851
No, we don't know what's over there.
Maybe nothing!

01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.968
It's too risky!

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:48.491
It's a chance.

01:15:58.120 --> 01:16:00.282
I'll take that chance.

01:16:01.680 --> 01:16:05.651
I've wanted to throw you away
ever since I met you.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.649
That's a joke, right?

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.689
What's a "joke"?

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.610
He made it!

01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:46.761
He made it.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.961
Okay, Thunk. Your turn.

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.645
You're not coming, are you?

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:56.640
When you make it, so will I.

01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.961
No!

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.210
You did good.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.051
Dadda!

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.201
Gran...

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:35.522
No mush. Just throw me.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.441
Wait.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:40.206
You surprised me today...

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:41.805
lunkhead.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:49.807
Still alive!

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.046
Time to go.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:53.281
No.

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:55.528
I have too much to say to you.

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:58.126
I need to fix everything,
and I don't have time.

01:17:58.280 --> 01:17:59.964
I can fix it.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:05.245
This works good.

01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.245
What do you call it?

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:12.402
I was thinking of calling it a "hug."

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:15.443
Because it rhymes with "Grug."

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.722
But you can change it if you want.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.650
No. I like "hug."

01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.885
I love you.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.601
I...

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.645
Dad...

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.124
I'm scared.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.766
Never be afraid.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.526
There!

01:19:26.680 --> 01:19:27.966
I see him!

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.761
Hey!

01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.331
Hey, I did it!

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.963
Back! Stay back!

01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.003
Stay back!

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.004
They're in trouble.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.481
Hang on, I'm coming!

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.649
How do I get across?

01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:34.969
I have to think. What would Guy do?

01:22:35.120 --> 01:22:37.851
What would Guy do, what would Guy do?

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.963
What would I do?

01:22:42.800 --> 01:22:44.290
Hold this.

01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:03.127
I have...

01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:03.904
an idea!

01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:29.681
Run!

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.205
Yes!

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:20.841
Douglas?

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.044
Hey, I know that guy.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.924
Hold on!

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:44.444
It's not safe here.

01:25:46.480 --> 01:25:48.130
I'll tell her.

01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.089
I never got to tell him.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:43.169
Eep, if your dad were here,
he would tell you to...

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.403
Get out of the way!

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.722
Wow. You sound just like him.

01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:52.646
Get out of the way!

01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.006
Dadda!

01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:55.400
He did it!

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:57.011
He's riding the sun.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:00.243
But, not very well.

01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:02.568
Everybody out of the way!

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:09.165
- Dad!
- Grug!

01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:12.168
Where's the danger?
Who blew their shell?

01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.883
I love you, too!

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.890
One, two, three, four...

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.565
five...

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:30.761
six...

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:33.922
and seven.

01:27:36.520 --> 01:27:37.726
And a half.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.525
And eight.

01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.401
Nine.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.688
Douglas! Dad, you saved him!

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.286
A boy has to have a pet.

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:53.846
Turns out I'm a cat person.

01:27:56.400 --> 01:27:57.561
No.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.888
You really need to see this.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.444
We should go there.

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:26.042
Yes! Coming through!

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.561
Wait!

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.890
<i>This is me. My name is Eep.</i>

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:41.289
<i>And this is my family, the Croods.</i>

01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:43.807
<i>If you weren't clued in
by the suntans and pets...</i>

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:46.651
<i>we're not exactly cavemen anymore.</i>

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:52.685
Let's do it again. I think I blinked.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:56.244
<i>Our world is still plenty harsh and hostile...</i>

01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:59.808
<i>but now we know the Croods will make it.</i>

01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:02.770
<i>Because we changed the rules...</i>

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.763
<i>the ones that kept us in the dark.</i>

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:11.685
<i>And because of my dad,
who taught us that anyone can change.</i>

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.524
Release the baby!

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.211
Sort of.

01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.288
<i>So, from now on,
we'll stay out here...</i>

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.562
<i>where we can follow the light.</i>
