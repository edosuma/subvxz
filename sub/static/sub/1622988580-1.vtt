03:01.107 --> 03:01.974
Pete!

03:03.109 --> 03:03.976
Hey Pete!

03:05.711 --> 03:06.979
Claire?

03:08.681 --> 03:10.549
Where are you?

03:10.615 --> 03:12.551
I'm in sci-fi.

03:20.126 --> 03:21.928
Doing some remodeling?

03:21.994 --> 03:23.461
I'm trying to.

03:29.035 --> 03:30.870
Hey, you're early!

03:30.937 --> 03:34.907
Did you hear? There were
two more murders last night!

03:34.974 --> 03:36.776
I know. It's awful.

03:37.910 --> 03:39.745
Do you realize
what this means?

03:39.812 --> 03:41.580
Hey, do you mind giving
me a hand with this?

03:41.647 --> 03:43.916
Four murders in our town
in less than two months!

03:43.983 --> 03:45.051
- Claire...
- It's him.

03:45.117 --> 03:46.686
- Hey...
- He's back!

03:46.752 --> 03:48.087
- Claire...
- Cutthroat!.

03:48.154 --> 03:48.955
Claire!

03:49.889 --> 03:50.990
Oh, sorry! Here, let me hope.

03:52.725 --> 03:54.060
It's all right.

03:55.895 --> 03:59.564
I'm just tying to get all
this stuff done before 6:00.

03:59.632 --> 04:00.599
It's 7:00.

04:00.666 --> 04:01.801
What?

04:01.868 --> 04:02.467
So the Cutthroat
Killer has to be somebody

04:02.534 --> 04:03.202
in Sheraton, right?

04:03.269 --> 04:04.237
Claire, please don't

04:04.303 --> 04:06.072
- start this again.
- But it has to be!

04:06.138 --> 04:06.739
I'm really not in the mood!

04:06.806 --> 04:07.472
But just listen!

04:07.539 --> 04:08.774
I don't wanna hear it!

04:08.841 --> 04:09.441
And neither does anyone
else who's coming tonight,

04:09.507 --> 04:11.143
which reminds me...

04:11.210 --> 04:12.912
Mikey can't make it.

04:14.080 --> 04:14.847
What?

04:14.914 --> 04:16.581
Mikey's seriously not coming?

04:16.649 --> 04:17.817
I'm afraid so.

04:17.884 --> 04:18.918
Why?

04:18.985 --> 04:20.552
Well, if your father
was the sheriff,

04:20.619 --> 04:21.586
do you think he'd allow you

04:21.654 --> 04:23.455
out of his sight
after last night?

04:23.521 --> 04:24.891
That's so lame!

04:24.957 --> 04:25.992
I know, I know.

04:26.058 --> 04:26.826
He was
really looking forward

04:26.893 --> 04:28.895
to sharing his story tonight.

04:28.961 --> 04:30.830
Oh, Hey. Sorry for your wait.

04:30.897 --> 04:32.665
No problem, man.

04:37.904 --> 04:39.805
Sorry, I got
stuck in the back.

04:39.872 --> 04:40.907
It's okay.

04:40.973 --> 04:42.909
I think I found what
I was looking for.

04:42.975 --> 04:45.745
- Oh yeah?
- Sure did.

04:45.811 --> 04:47.747
Okay, what do we have?

04:47.813 --> 04:49.916
"Tales of..."
something I can't pronounce.

04:49.982 --> 04:50.783
Oh yeah, this is...

04:51.717 --> 04:52.550
This is great!

04:52.617 --> 04:53.451
I love this book.

04:53.518 --> 04:55.988
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:59.557 --> 05:00.558
Here's that.

05:01.994 --> 05:03.729
Thank you so much.

05:04.964 --> 05:06.699
Here's your bookmark, and...

05:06.766 --> 05:07.565
enjoy.

05:07.633 --> 05:08.500
Awesome.

05:17.076 --> 05:18.576
He was awkward.

05:19.812 --> 05:20.813
You think?

05:21.948 --> 05:23.249
What are you doing
with all this anyway?

05:23.316 --> 05:26.786
Oh, I'm just trying to get
rid of this old inventory,

05:26.852 --> 05:28.788
make some room.

05:28.854 --> 05:31.657
Seems like a lot of
work to do on your own.

05:31.724 --> 05:32.658
Sure you don't need the services

05:32.725 --> 05:34.660
of a highly
enthusiastic, helpful,

05:34.727 --> 05:36.996
and yet reasonably
priced employee?

05:37.063 --> 05:38.764
Claire...

05:38.831 --> 05:42.001
if I could afford
you, you know I would.

05:42.068 --> 05:42.935
I know.

05:43.769 --> 05:46.538
Well, the place looks great.

05:46.604 --> 05:47.640
Ah, thanks.

05:49.241 --> 05:51.677
It's definitely been a lot.

05:51.744 --> 05:54.847
Your parents would
be really proud.

05:56.048 --> 05:58.317
Keep you face always
toward the sun...

05:58.384 --> 06:00.720
And the shadows
will fall behind you!

06:00.786 --> 06:01.687
Whitman!

06:01.754 --> 06:03.022
Very nice.

06:03.089 --> 06:04.290
Keep up on my reading.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.225
Well, as long as you
keep up on your writing...

06:06.292 --> 06:07.159
Maybe.

06:08.227 --> 06:10.896
Claire, every time
I read your work,

06:10.963 --> 06:14.133
I'm completely blown
away, and I read a lot.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.267
Yeah.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.135
I mean, you
have all the makings

06:16.202 --> 06:19.638
of a hugely successful author.

06:19.705 --> 06:22.074
You really think so?

06:22.141 --> 06:23.009
Yes.

06:25.144 --> 06:26.012
Thanks.

06:28.314 --> 06:32.151
- What's this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, forget it!

06:35.321 --> 06:36.789
Diego!

06:36.856 --> 06:38.590
Glad to see you could make it.

06:38.657 --> 06:39.792
Yeah.

06:39.859 --> 06:40.525
I...

06:40.592 --> 06:41.526
closed the shop early.

06:41.593 --> 06:44.263
There's no customers.
Damn curfew.

06:44.330 --> 06:45.264
What happened to your face?

06:45.331 --> 06:46.265
Claire!

06:46.332 --> 06:47.933
What?

06:48.000 --> 06:49.201
Pete...

06:49.268 --> 06:50.136
It's cool.

06:51.170 --> 06:54.640
Nothing hair of
the dog won't fix.

06:54.707 --> 06:55.808
Anyway, it gave me an
idea to get some things

06:55.875 --> 06:57.710
out of my head and...

06:57.777 --> 06:59.378
down on paper.

06:59.445 --> 07:00.479
Well, that's great to hear.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.949
Sounds like a true
writer in the making.

07:04.016 --> 07:04.884
Yeah.

07:04.950 --> 07:05.818
Right.

07:08.220 --> 07:10.122
Well, if you and Claire
wanna head to the back,

07:10.189 --> 07:12.624
I'm just gonna finish
up some stuff here

07:12.691 --> 07:14.794
and we'll begin shortly.

07:14.860 --> 07:16.629
But hey...

07:16.695 --> 07:18.264
I'm glad you're here.

07:19.465 --> 07:21.233
Yeah, Pete. Thanks.

07:43.722 --> 07:44.589
Hey!

07:51.030 --> 07:51.897
What?

07:59.004 --> 08:01.807
Okay, my writing warriors!

08:01.874 --> 08:04.410
Who's ready to get started?

08:04.477 --> 08:06.312
Oh, I put a fresh
pot of coffee on,

08:06.378 --> 08:09.048
so, as always, help yourselves

08:12.918 --> 08:13.919
Uh, Naomi?

08:16.155 --> 08:17.123
Hi.

08:17.189 --> 08:18.623
Would you mind?

08:22.261 --> 08:23.129
Thank you.

08:23.996 --> 08:25.231
Okay, guys, I have to tell you,

08:25.297 --> 08:28.334
I am so excited to hear
what you brought in tonight!

08:28.400 --> 08:30.736
So, who wants to go first?

08:42.347 --> 08:43.948
That's funny. I
thought I locked up.

08:45.050 --> 08:48.020
Hello? We're closed
for this evening!

08:49.455 --> 08:50.322
Hello?

08:53.058 --> 08:54.126
Give me just a minute.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.414
Hey, you made it!

09:15.481 --> 09:16.215
Sorry I'm late.

09:16.282 --> 09:17.249
No, you're just in time!

09:17.316 --> 09:18.884
Take a seat! We
haven't started yet.

09:18.951 --> 09:19.818
Cool.

09:26.458 --> 09:28.761
You know, Mikey, I'm
sorry, I have to ask.

09:28.827 --> 09:30.362
Does your father know
that you're here tonight?

09:30.429 --> 09:31.931
Yeah, he does.

09:31.997 --> 09:33.199
That's a lie.

09:34.867 --> 09:35.734
I'm a mom.

09:38.003 --> 09:38.672
Well?

09:40.606 --> 09:41.407
Okay, I snuck out hell.

09:41.473 --> 09:42.775
Hell yes!

09:42.841 --> 09:43.809
Before you freak out-

09:43.876 --> 09:45.110
- Eh, eh, eh, eh!
Absolutely not!

09:45.177 --> 09:46.512
Mikey, you're going home!

09:46.579 --> 09:47.813
It's not that big of a deal.

09:47.880 --> 09:48.914
Come on, just let him stay!

09:48.981 --> 09:50.316
Forget it!

09:50.382 --> 09:51.951
What would happen if your dad
found out that you were here?

09:52.017 --> 09:53.819
He's not gonna find out.

09:53.886 --> 09:54.920
He's working late
tonight anyway,

09:54.987 --> 09:56.222
and my mom's at a
double at the hospital.

09:56.288 --> 09:57.323
He already came all this way.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.357
Yeah, yeah.

09:58.424 --> 09:59.225
Besides, like,
wouldn't it be better

09:59.291 --> 10:01.794
if I was with you guys anyway?

10:01.860 --> 10:06.865
You really want me wandering
the streets alone at night?

10:07.533 --> 10:08.867
I gotta hand it to him, Pete.

10:08.934 --> 10:09.602
Kids got a point.

10:09.669 --> 10:10.803
Why am I not surprised

10:10.869 --> 10:13.939
that you would actually
side with a delinquent?

10:14.006 --> 10:15.040
Kiss my ass!

10:15.107 --> 10:17.142
Oh, real
mature there, Diego.

10:17.209 --> 10:19.912
Oh, man. Pete, I think I'm
coming down with something.

10:19.979 --> 10:22.481
Yeah, you know what? He
does look a little pale.

10:22.548 --> 10:24.416
I think it might be a
case of the dickless.

10:24.483 --> 10:26.418
Speaking of which, how
is your husband these days?

10:26.485 --> 10:27.853
Guys, that's enough!

10:27.920 --> 10:29.154
Please, Pete?

10:30.155 --> 10:32.124
Okay, I really need this.

10:32.191 --> 10:34.994
Things at home are crazy
right now with my dad

10:35.060 --> 10:37.029
and the case and just...

10:38.564 --> 10:42.368
I need to get away for a
couple hours, you know?

10:42.434 --> 10:43.102
Please!

10:45.938 --> 10:47.973
Okay, okay, okay, fine!

10:48.974 --> 10:50.075
Fine!

10:50.142 --> 10:52.244
But if I hear from the
sheriff, one call...

10:52.311 --> 10:53.212
I got it.

10:54.213 --> 10:55.981
I'm gonna go
close up the shop.

10:56.048 --> 10:58.484
Make sure nobody else walks in.

11:04.356 --> 11:05.692
Any updates? Who
are they thinking?

11:05.759 --> 11:09.194
They haven't released the
names of the victims yet but...

11:09.261 --> 11:11.297
I overheard my dad talking
on the phone this morning,

11:11.363 --> 11:13.899
and I know it's all just
speculation at the moment

11:13.966 --> 11:15.267
and I can't really
trust what he says,

11:15.334 --> 11:16.335
but it's not that-

11:16.402 --> 11:18.337
- Did we
already start sharing?

11:18.404 --> 11:20.439
No, we were just
talking about...

11:20.506 --> 11:21.307
This week's
writing assignment.

11:21.373 --> 11:22.709
Exactly. Yeah.

11:22.776 --> 11:24.644
Please tell me you're not
interrogating Mikey right now.

11:24.711 --> 11:25.712
He's just a kid.

11:25.779 --> 11:28.180
You shouldn't be
bringing this stuff up.

11:28.247 --> 11:30.349
Wait, bringing what up?

11:35.054 --> 11:35.888
Cutthroat.

11:35.954 --> 11:36.690
Seriously!

11:36.756 --> 11:38.023
Every week, the same shit!

11:38.090 --> 11:39.258
Why can't we talk about it?

11:39.325 --> 11:40.426
It's been all over the news!

11:40.492 --> 11:41.560
It has to be him!

11:41.628 --> 11:42.561
Or a copycat killer.

11:42.629 --> 11:43.429
You think?

11:43.495 --> 11:44.229
What's been all over the news?

11:44.296 --> 11:45.364
How have you not heard?

11:45.431 --> 11:47.900
Two more people were
killed last night!

11:47.966 --> 11:49.034
No shit?

11:49.101 --> 11:51.403
Okay, guys, let's
just get back on track.

11:51.470 --> 11:53.305
I overheard my dad saying
that the throats of the victims

11:53.372 --> 11:56.175
from last night were
cut from ear to ear.

11:56.241 --> 11:57.309
Jesus!

11:57.376 --> 11:59.144
See! I was right!

11:59.211 --> 12:01.080
I highly doubt that
was meant for us to hear

12:01.146 --> 12:02.348
Why are you so
interested in this?

12:02.414 --> 12:04.416
I mean, seriously, are
you trying to pick up tips

12:04.483 --> 12:06.952
for when you finally
crack and go psycho?

12:07.019 --> 12:07.886
No.

12:08.722 --> 12:09.521
I want this gut to get caught

12:09.588 --> 12:11.590
just as much as everybody else.

12:11.658 --> 12:14.259
What makes you
so sure it's a guy?

12:14.326 --> 12:16.995
What's happening is terrible.

12:18.997 --> 12:20.199
Still, you can't
help but find it all

12:20.265 --> 12:22.067
a bit fascinating, right?

12:22.134 --> 12:23.168
Think about it.

12:23.235 --> 12:25.170
13 years ago, Cutthroat
killed five people

12:25.237 --> 12:26.605
and then just disappeared
without a trace.

12:27.841 --> 12:29.475
And now we've had four
murders in our town.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.609
And from what it looks like,

12:30.677 --> 12:33.479
they've been killed
in the exact same way.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.013
Yeah.

12:35.080 --> 12:37.383
But you want to
know what I think?

12:37.449 --> 12:38.484
Yeah. What?

12:38.550 --> 12:40.219
You're crazy! And the killer!

12:40.285 --> 12:41.954
Case solved! You're all welcome!

12:42.020 --> 12:42.689
She is not!

12:42.756 --> 12:44.523
Okay, that's enough!

12:44.590 --> 12:46.492
We came here to hear
our stories, okay?

12:46.558 --> 12:47.359
And that's...

12:47.426 --> 12:48.762
that's what I really wanna do.

12:48.828 --> 12:53.633
In fact, you know what? That's
what we are gonna do, okay?

12:53.700 --> 12:54.967
Sorry.

12:55.033 --> 12:56.068
Sorry.

12:56.135 --> 12:58.003
Look, I know in
light of recent events,

12:58.070 --> 12:59.672
tonight's theme might
seem a little macabre,

12:59.739 --> 13:02.274
however, we're all writers,

13:02.341 --> 13:05.310
and we gotta stay
true to our work.

13:06.245 --> 13:07.112
Scare me.

13:07.980 --> 13:10.082
That was this week's assignment.

13:10.149 --> 13:11.718
You were all supposed
to write a short story

13:11.785 --> 13:15.988
that is not only scary
but very personal to you.

13:17.456 --> 13:18.658
Yeah, Pete...

13:20.025 --> 13:22.461
I'm not gonna lie, I really
wasn't feeling this one, man.

13:22.528 --> 13:24.062
Why not?

13:26.498 --> 13:27.767
I don't know.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.135
I guess there's just not a
whole lot that scares me.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.105
That's bullshit.

13:33.172 --> 13:34.173
Real bullshit!

13:34.239 --> 13:36.743
I don't remember
anybody asking you.

13:36.810 --> 13:37.877
Look, all I'm saying, guys,

13:37.943 --> 13:39.011
is maybe I shouldn't
read tonight is all.

13:39.077 --> 13:41.180
No, you totally
should! We all should.

13:41.246 --> 13:42.381
I mean, why
would you even come

13:42.448 --> 13:44.016
if you weren't gonna share?

13:44.082 --> 13:46.686
I really liked
this assignment.

13:48.086 --> 13:51.423
I just found it kind of
therapeutic, you know?

13:51.490 --> 13:52.692
I do.

13:52.759 --> 13:54.359
I think we all do.

13:55.494 --> 13:57.229
You have to share, Diego.

13:57.296 --> 14:01.166
There's no judgment here.
It's just open minds.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.637
This is a safe place.

14:07.506 --> 14:09.274
Yeah, Diego...

14:09.341 --> 14:10.409
Why don't you read?

14:10.476 --> 14:12.177
Look, if you're so
eager to get started,

14:12.244 --> 14:13.445
why don't you go first?

14:13.512 --> 14:14.179
Naomi?

14:15.280 --> 14:17.316
Would you do us the honor?

14:17.382 --> 14:18.250
Sure.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.353
'Cause I was actually
feeling this one.

14:21.420 --> 14:22.421
Well that's interesting.

14:22.488 --> 14:25.290
Okay, so, what was
your inspiration?

14:29.796 --> 14:30.663
Well...

14:31.831 --> 14:35.567
I guess you can say it's
about feeling trapped.

14:35.635 --> 14:36.502
About...

14:37.804 --> 14:41.473
being a prisoner
in your own skin.

14:41.540 --> 14:42.407
Okay.

14:44.777 --> 14:46.646
Whenever you're ready.

14:51.751 --> 14:53.218
It's called...

15:05.765 --> 15:07.032
What?

15:07.099 --> 15:07.767
Please,
please, just listen to me, okay?

15:07.834 --> 15:08.868
Stop calling!

15:08.935 --> 15:11.103
I
know how upset you are,

15:11.169 --> 15:13.806
but you're the
only woman I love.

15:15.574 --> 15:17.142
I was weak.

15:17.209 --> 15:18.410
I made a mistake.

15:18.477 --> 15:19.511
Bullshit!

15:19.578 --> 15:20.612
It
won't happen again.

15:21.513 --> 15:24.182
I love you. Please come home.

15:24.249 --> 15:25.652
You know what?

15:25.718 --> 15:26.986
Don't call again.

15:27.052 --> 15:29.154
Don't you
fucking dare hang up on me!

15:29.221 --> 15:31.590
You think you can just leave?

15:32.725 --> 15:34.661
Where are you gonna go, huh?

15:34.727 --> 15:38.263
You're nothing without
me, and you know it!

15:38.330 --> 15:41.400
You hear me? You
ungrateful bitch!

17:00.278 --> 17:01.146
Oh, hey.

17:02.214 --> 17:04.316
Yeah, we're closing
in like 10 minutes.

17:04.383 --> 17:06.550
So, place gets a
little...

17:06.617 --> 17:07.819
dark, you know?

17:09.989 --> 17:11.691
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

17:16.361 --> 17:17.429
Amen to that, right.

17:57.602 --> 17:59.739
Hallowed be thy name.

17:59.806 --> 18:02.809
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done...

18:19.624 --> 18:20.492
Hello?

18:23.361 --> 18:24.630
Are you all right?

18:24.697 --> 18:27.365
Do you want me to call of help?

18:30.368 --> 18:31.369
Stay back.

18:32.504 --> 18:33.271
Stay back I say.

18:33.338 --> 18:34.539
I'm just here to help you.

18:34.606 --> 18:35.507
You look like you're hurt.

18:35.574 --> 18:36.976
Stay back I say!

18:38.443 --> 18:39.712
Leave this place.

18:39.779 --> 18:41.914
Please, let me help you.

18:43.415 --> 18:44.282
Wait.

18:46.786 --> 18:48.320
Please, wait!

18:50.455 --> 18:51.423
Stop, please!

18:57.429 --> 18:58.731
Please!

18:58.798 --> 19:00.733
I just want to help. That's all.

19:07.405 --> 19:08.540
Father?

19:20.753 --> 19:21.620
Father?

19:28.728 --> 19:30.029
Oh my God!

19:54.887 --> 19:55.755
Father?

19:58.623 --> 19:59.491
Holy shit!

20:00.625 --> 20:01.761
Holy shit!

20:06.531 --> 20:07.700
Shit!

20:07.767 --> 20:08.634
Shit!

20:08.701 --> 20:10.402
Help! Somebody!

20:10.468 --> 20:12.138
Help! Please!

20:17.143 --> 20:18.945
Nice!

20:19.011 --> 20:20.612
Come on! See me!

20:24.116 --> 20:25.685
Shit.

20:25.751 --> 20:26.886
What the fuck?

20:47.807 --> 20:48.975
Hello?

20:49.041 --> 20:50.142
Please...

20:50.209 --> 20:51.043
help me.

20:54.647 --> 20:55.982
Where are you?

20:56.048 --> 20:59.852
Somewhere dark,
and I can't breathe.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.454
Help me. Help.

21:14.267 --> 21:15.735
Hello?

21:15.801 --> 21:16.601
I'm scared!

21:21.573 --> 21:23.541
It's okay, sweetie.
I'm gonna get you out.

21:24.277 --> 21:25.177
Shit!

21:25.244 --> 21:27.512
Please, hurry!

21:27.579 --> 21:28.848
Just hang tight.

21:31.250 --> 21:33.185
I'll get you out, okay?

21:59.912 --> 22:01.047
You must not.

22:20.132 --> 22:21.233
Hello?

22:21.300 --> 22:23.903
It's so dark in here!

22:29.675 --> 22:30.676
Oh, Jesus!

22:32.011 --> 22:33.511
Help me!

22:34.380 --> 22:36.015
It's okay, sweetie.

22:36.082 --> 22:37.249
I'm gonna get you outta here.

22:42.822 --> 22:43.823
I've got it.

23:03.009 --> 23:04.576
Hey...

23:04.643 --> 23:06.645
Sweetie, can you see me?

23:09.048 --> 23:09.915
Help!

23:10.916 --> 23:11.851
Please!

23:11.917 --> 23:13.052
Somebody help!

23:14.420 --> 23:15.921
I need your help!

23:18.257 --> 23:20.026
Sweetheart...

23:20.092 --> 23:23.295
I have to go find something
to break you out of this box.

23:23.362 --> 23:25.131
I'm gonna be right back.

23:25.197 --> 23:26.799
Okay?

25:28.187 --> 25:29.388
Come on!

25:40.900 --> 25:41.767
Fu...

25:44.570 --> 25:45.437
ck!

25:46.939 --> 25:48.240
College, I know!

25:48.307 --> 25:49.108
I want to go to college.

25:49.175 --> 25:51.143
Well, you should go to college.

25:51.210 --> 25:52.411
But I like stairs so much!

25:52.478 --> 25:54.413
I want to climb up stairs
all the fucking time!

25:54.480 --> 25:55.347
God dammit!

26:40.559 --> 26:41.427
Hello?

26:45.130 --> 26:45.998
All right.

26:51.170 --> 26:51.837
Whoa!

26:51.904 --> 26:53.439
Hey! You can't be here!

26:54.373 --> 26:55.040
Please!

26:55.107 --> 26:55.741
We're closed!

26:55.808 --> 26:56.875
No, please!

26:56.942 --> 26:57.677
- You've gotta help me!
- I told you before,

26:57.743 --> 26:58.143
we closed 10 minutes ago.

26:58.210 --> 27:00.145
Come on.

27:00.212 --> 27:00.779
- You gotta go.
- Please help me!

27:01.681 --> 27:02.682
No, come on. You gotta go.

28:13.319 --> 28:14.186
No!

28:41.113 --> 28:42.047
Please!

29:03.369 --> 29:04.403
Wow!

29:06.138 --> 29:07.306
Naomi!

29:07.373 --> 29:09.074
That was great!

29:09.141 --> 29:10.342
Thanks. It...

29:10.409 --> 29:11.410
It did get a little dark.

29:11.477 --> 29:13.212
That's what was
so great about it!

29:13.278 --> 29:14.647
Really good!

29:14.714 --> 29:15.581
Yeah.

29:17.015 --> 29:17.916
I liked it.

29:23.422 --> 29:24.724
Guess I'll go next?

29:24.791 --> 29:25.991
Of course!

29:27.192 --> 29:28.560
Before I start...

29:31.096 --> 29:35.000
I just wanted to thank you guys
for letting me in the group.

29:35.067 --> 29:36.602
Especially you, Pete.

29:36.669 --> 29:39.138
I know I'm the newest and...

29:40.372 --> 29:42.174
well, it's just
kind of nice to...

29:42.241 --> 29:46.979
actually be in a group
where my voice is heard.

29:47.045 --> 29:50.717
Yeah, communication isn't
really the best in my house...

29:50.784 --> 29:52.384
with my dad and...

29:53.285 --> 29:55.421
my whole family is just...

29:59.458 --> 30:00.959
Hey, it's okay.

30:02.127 --> 30:03.328
Take your time.

30:06.598 --> 30:08.467
Whenever you're ready.

30:22.448 --> 30:23.315
Here goes.

30:36.361 --> 30:38.096
Authorities
remain baffled tonight

30:38.163 --> 30:40.332
as yet another bizarre
instance of ritual suicide

30:40.399 --> 30:42.434
was discovered today
in Sugarton apartment

30:42.501 --> 30:44.303
off the highway into town.

30:44.369 --> 30:46.171
This brings the count
to now three cases

30:46.238 --> 30:47.272
in the last two months,

30:47.339 --> 30:49.241
with police having
found no apparent motive

30:49.308 --> 30:52.712
or understanding to the reasons
behind this brutal acts.

30:52.779 --> 30:53.813
We're learning now
that it was a neighbor

30:53.880 --> 30:56.181
who first discovered
the grizzly scene.

30:56.248 --> 30:58.450
A family of three dead,
with even the child's wounds

30:58.517 --> 31:01.220
appearing to have
been self-inflicted.

31:01.286 --> 31:02.588
Police on the scene
are continuing

31:02.655 --> 31:03.823
their investigation tonight

31:03.890 --> 31:06.091
in hopes of finding
answers as to the reasons

31:06.158 --> 31:09.328
behind this acts.

31:11.631 --> 31:12.799
What?

31:12.866 --> 31:14.266
They're home.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.401
Is he okay?

31:17.269 --> 31:18.504
I don't know.

31:23.242 --> 31:24.644
It wasn't supposed
to happen like that.

31:24.711 --> 31:25.577
I know.

31:26.713 --> 31:28.280
Just calm down.

31:30.717 --> 31:34.086
We'll get
this right away.

31:34.152 --> 31:34.787
I've got work to do.

31:34.854 --> 31:36.622
No. Hey, calm down.

31:37.857 --> 31:40.492
You heard what the Captain said.

31:40.559 --> 31:41.861
You need to rest.

31:41.928 --> 31:43.195
Okay?

31:43.262 --> 31:44.764
So, let me help you.

31:46.331 --> 31:47.165
Come on.

31:48.300 --> 31:49.368
There you go.

32:03.783 --> 32:04.784
Dad?

32:06.184 --> 32:06.786
Daniel?

32:06.853 --> 32:08.253
One egg or two?

32:09.488 --> 32:10.289
Thank you, Craig.

32:10.355 --> 32:11.658
Daniel!

32:11.724 --> 32:12.759
I'm standing
outside the police court...

32:12.825 --> 32:13.625
Hey...

32:13.693 --> 32:14.560
Dingus.

32:14.626 --> 32:15.427
What?

32:15.494 --> 32:16.361
Mom?

32:18.430 --> 32:19.866
Two eggs fine?

32:19.933 --> 32:21.133
Uh, yeah, that's fine.

32:21.199 --> 32:22.301
It appears
to be yet another case

32:22.367 --> 32:25.237
of ritualistic suicide
that has now spanned,

32:25.304 --> 32:27.506
over the course of two months...

32:28.875 --> 32:32.779
three confirmed families
having killed themselves.

32:32.845 --> 32:33.780
Hey, Mom?

32:34.847 --> 32:36.849
Is everything all
right with Dad?

32:36.916 --> 32:38.718
You father's just fine.

32:38.785 --> 32:40.687
I was a long night at work.

32:40.753 --> 32:44.724
So, it was a mutual decision
to take some time off.

32:44.791 --> 32:46.693
Which would be
great for all of us.

32:46.759 --> 32:48.293
What happened?

32:48.360 --> 32:49.428
Did he shoot someone?

32:49.494 --> 32:50.462
Really?

32:50.529 --> 32:51.530
Listen, I'm going
to need you both

32:51.597 --> 32:55.167
to ease off the
questions for now, okay?

32:55.233 --> 32:57.637
He's been under a
lot of pressure.

32:57.704 --> 32:59.538
He's had a lot of stress.

32:59.605 --> 33:02.608
And it won't do him any
good if you bother him.

33:02.675 --> 33:04.509
He's the
one asking, not me!

33:04.576 --> 33:05.945
Please.

33:06.012 --> 33:08.246
I need you both to agree.

33:10.549 --> 33:11.684
- Okay.
- Okay.

33:12.652 --> 33:13.686
Now...

33:13.753 --> 33:14.787
go give your father a hug

33:14.854 --> 33:16.488
and let him know that
breakfast is ready.

33:16.555 --> 33:17.356
A hug?

33:18.091 --> 33:19.625
Daniel...

33:22.929 --> 33:24.329
They hope to
have more information for us

33:24.396 --> 33:26.231
in the next 24 hours.

33:27.934 --> 33:28.868
Hey, Dad?

33:29.869 --> 33:30.670
Breakfast is ready.

33:31.570 --> 33:34.139
He was there. He was there.

33:35.307 --> 33:36.475
Dad?

33:43.750 --> 33:44.616
Jeez!

33:45.685 --> 33:46.485
Do you think he's-

33:48.453 --> 33:49.254
Hal!

33:50.657 --> 33:52.892
It's okay, it's okay, it's
okay, it's okay, it's okay.

33:52.959 --> 33:55.327
Hal, Hal, look at me.

33:55.394 --> 33:55.995
It's all right.

34:13.713 --> 34:15.648
What did you do?

34:15.715 --> 34:17.717
I don't know.

34:20.853 --> 34:22.822
I know.

34:22.889 --> 34:24.757
Just calm down.

34:24.824 --> 34:26.358
You need to rest.

34:26.425 --> 34:27.391
Okay?

34:29.527 --> 34:31.898
All right, I'm off to work.

34:31.964 --> 34:33.800
It's a double, so
I'm gonna be late.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.635
Spaghetti's in the fridge.

34:35.702 --> 34:37.569
Is dad okay?

34:37.637 --> 34:38.402
He's asleep.

34:38.469 --> 34:41.406
If anything happens, call me.

34:41.473 --> 34:42.340
Okay.

36:27.713 --> 36:28.513
Daniel?

36:29.882 --> 36:30.750
Daniel?

36:32.118 --> 36:33.351
Are you okay?

36:35.888 --> 36:37.757
I found something...

36:39.457 --> 36:40.726
in dad's office.

36:42.929 --> 36:43.963
What the hell?

36:44.030 --> 36:46.766
You know we're not
supposed to go in there!

36:46.833 --> 36:48.034
If Mom and Dad find out
that you were in there,

36:48.100 --> 36:50.803
you're gonna get
in huge trouble.

36:50.870 --> 36:51.737
So will I.

37:09.989 --> 37:10.857
Jesus.

37:12.992 --> 37:14.593
This is fucked up.

37:17.063 --> 37:19.665
You shouldn't have seen this.

37:19.732 --> 37:21.801
I couldn't help it.

37:21.868 --> 37:23.836
I just wanted to
know what he saw.

37:27.974 --> 37:30.375
Go to your room.

38:26.966 --> 38:27.833
Sarah!

38:31.270 --> 38:32.071
Sarah?

38:47.253 --> 38:48.120
Mom?

39:10.009 --> 39:10.876
Dad?

39:12.645 --> 39:14.146
Were you in my office?

39:17.283 --> 39:18.684
Was that you...

39:21.287 --> 39:22.688
or your sister?

39:28.928 --> 39:29.929
It was me.

39:31.831 --> 39:33.099
She didn't know.

39:42.408 --> 39:43.876
Do you feel...

39:45.311 --> 39:46.178
heavy?

39:48.347 --> 39:49.915
Heavy?

39:49.982 --> 39:50.850
Yes.

39:52.418 --> 39:53.285
Bound.

39:55.955 --> 39:56.822
Tethered.

40:04.030 --> 40:05.898
I have to cut loose...

40:06.899 --> 40:08.533
what keeps me here.

40:10.069 --> 40:11.037
We all do.

40:42.101 --> 40:43.069
I love you.

41:03.389 --> 41:06.158
I think something's happening.

42:39.118 --> 42:40.452
Daniel...

42:44.823 --> 42:45.991
Do you feel it?

42:47.593 --> 42:49.428
Do you feel...

42:49.495 --> 42:50.362
heavy?

42:53.465 --> 42:54.300
It's okay.

42:56.435 --> 42:57.269
Finish it.

43:06.946 --> 43:08.347
Cut yourself lose.

43:15.254 --> 43:16.455
Something's happening.

43:16.522 --> 43:17.556
It was
the neighbors who first...

43:17.623 --> 43:19.858
Do not go in
my fucking office!

43:19.925 --> 43:21.393
Do you understand that?

43:24.897 --> 43:26.298
Finish it.

43:37.009 --> 43:38.444
Fuck, man.

43:38.510 --> 43:40.479
That's a great story.

43:40.546 --> 43:42.448
Hey, thanks, man.

43:42.514 --> 43:44.516
Nice shiner, by the way.

43:57.296 --> 43:58.163
Hello?

44:05.904 --> 44:06.772
Hello?

44:13.479 --> 44:15.981
Oh, oh!

44:16.048 --> 44:16.849
Oh!

44:16.915 --> 44:17.717
Shoot.

44:17.783 --> 44:18.450
I'm so sorry I startled you.

44:18.517 --> 44:19.318
Sorry.

44:20.919 --> 44:22.454
Anyways, we're...

44:22.521 --> 44:24.123
We're getting ready
to start back up.

44:24.189 --> 44:25.958
Yeah, we probably should.

44:26.025 --> 44:28.861
I'll bet Naomi and Diego are
at each other's throats by now.

44:28.927 --> 44:31.130
That is an understatement

44:38.604 --> 44:39.905
Don't let Pete catch
you with your phone!

44:39.972 --> 44:41.006
You know he hates that!

44:41.073 --> 44:41.874
Just listen.

44:41.940 --> 44:43.275
My sister just texted me that...

44:43.342 --> 44:45.277
my dad still hasn't released
the names of the victims yet,

44:45.344 --> 44:48.947
by she said it was
Jasmin something and...

44:50.215 --> 44:51.016
Kyle Waterford.

44:51.083 --> 44:52.251
What?

44:52.318 --> 44:52.985
Yeah, I think the police
are gonna release it

44:53.052 --> 44:53.585
to the press tomorrow.

44:53.653 --> 44:55.020
What's that?

44:57.389 --> 44:59.258
Oh, nothing, just...

45:06.231 --> 45:07.099
Okay.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.036
Diego, you're up next?

45:11.103 --> 45:11.970
Yeah.

45:13.505 --> 45:15.007
Well, it...

45:15.074 --> 45:16.208
needs a little work.

45:16.275 --> 45:17.076
You know, don't worry.

45:17.142 --> 45:19.912
I'll be sure to give you input.

45:19.978 --> 45:21.980
So tell me, Diego...

45:22.047 --> 45:24.116
What inspired your story?

45:25.417 --> 45:28.153
Well, I guess you could say...

45:29.521 --> 45:30.122
quicksand.

45:30.189 --> 45:31.390
Ooh! Scary stuff!

45:31.457 --> 45:33.459
I heard you're just
supposed to like stand there

45:33.525 --> 45:34.927
and that's the best
way to stay safe.

45:34.993 --> 45:36.028
You just like sit there

45:36.095 --> 45:39.465
and nothing happens
if you just kinda...

45:39.531 --> 45:40.667
That's what I heard
about quicksand.

45:40.734 --> 45:43.102
I don't know that much, but...

45:43.168 --> 45:45.170
It's pretty cool, right?

45:47.406 --> 45:48.440
No.

45:48.507 --> 45:49.241
No, no.

45:49.308 --> 45:51.644
Not like actual quicksand.

45:52.511 --> 45:54.313
It's like when you...

45:56.181 --> 45:58.584
When you feel stuck, you know?

46:02.421 --> 46:06.091
It's like you try everything
to get out, but...

46:06.158 --> 46:08.394
the more you try...

46:08.460 --> 46:10.195
the deeper you sink.

46:11.497 --> 46:13.298
It just sucks you in.

46:15.567 --> 46:17.970
So, yeah, that's where I...

46:18.036 --> 46:21.039
I got my inspiration from that.

46:21.106 --> 46:21.974
Quicksand.

46:22.742 --> 46:24.610
That's actually...

46:24.677 --> 46:26.311
really interesting.

46:28.347 --> 46:30.382
Go ahead, whenever you're ready.

46:33.452 --> 46:36.455
All right.

46:36.522 --> 46:37.657
I call mine...

47:16.161 --> 47:17.396
I really
appreciate this, man.

47:17.463 --> 47:21.266
Yeah, man, no
problem. Where you headed?

47:21.333 --> 47:23.636
As far out
as you can take me, man.

47:23.703 --> 47:24.436
Need to get out of the city.

47:24.503 --> 47:26.038
- Thanks.
- No problem.

47:26.104 --> 47:27.306
It's the least I can do.

47:38.217 --> 47:39.284
Thanks, man.

47:39.351 --> 47:39.953
Yeah, good
luck out there, dude.

47:40.018 --> 47:41.386
I appreciate it.

49:54.519 --> 49:55.387
Hello?

50:20.947 --> 50:21.814
Hello?

50:48.841 --> 50:50.475
Whoa, whoa!

50:50.542 --> 50:51.778
The keys!

50:51.844 --> 50:52.577
What?

50:52.645 --> 50:53.578
Give me the fucking keys!

50:53.646 --> 50:56.448
Take 'em, take 'em!

51:04.957 --> 51:06.291
God damn it!

51:07.392 --> 51:08.961
Hey look, man, the
door was open, man.

51:09.028 --> 51:10.963
I didn't take anything.

51:19.639 --> 51:20.505
Here.

51:21.741 --> 51:24.811
You better get
outta here, kid.

51:24.877 --> 51:25.544
What?

51:29.115 --> 51:31.450
Hey, man, what's going on?

51:32.584 --> 51:33.485
Look, kid, if
you don't leave...

51:34.219 --> 51:34.887
you're gonna die!

51:34.954 --> 51:36.956
All right, all right.

51:41.027 --> 51:43.361
Hey, man what's out there?

51:44.130 --> 51:44.731
My wife!

51:47.566 --> 51:49.035
Russel?

52:01.413 --> 52:02.280
Russell!

52:10.388 --> 52:12.725
Please stop, Mary-Lynn!

52:12.792 --> 52:14.026
Please!

52:14.093 --> 52:15.594
Help!

52:15.661 --> 52:16.461
Russell!

52:20.666 --> 52:21.934
Help me, please!

52:31.677 --> 52:32.544
Russell?

52:35.915 --> 52:36.983
Help me.

52:40.052 --> 52:40.987
Russell!

52:43.488 --> 52:45.490
What the fuck are you?

53:36.943 --> 53:40.746
Russell...

53:44.750 --> 53:45.617
Russell...

53:54.126 --> 53:54.994
Help me.

54:56.822 --> 54:59.158
Better get outta here, kid.

55:14.307 --> 55:16.508
What the fuck?

55:18.110 --> 55:19.178
Jesus Christ!

55:29.722 --> 55:31.523
What the fuck?

55:33.926 --> 55:35.695
Oh, Jesus Christ!

55:35.761 --> 55:36.429
Come on!

55:36.494 --> 55:37.529
Come on, baby! Come on!

55:39.865 --> 55:42.567
Come on!

55:44.203 --> 55:45.171
Fuck!

55:45.237 --> 55:46.672
Jesus!

55:53.079 --> 55:55.214
Please go! Go away!

55:55.281 --> 55:59.584
Go away, go away, go
away, please go, go.

56:27.747 --> 56:28.748
Diego!

56:28.814 --> 56:31.117
Great, Diego! Really
thrilling stuff!

56:31.183 --> 56:32.251
Totally!

56:32.318 --> 56:33.886
Really see all the
different parallels.

56:33.953 --> 56:35.021
Actually...

56:36.022 --> 56:38.090
Yes, it was well-written.

56:39.358 --> 56:40.226
Thanks.

56:42.061 --> 56:43.629
Claire...

56:43.696 --> 56:45.931
Last but not least!

56:45.998 --> 56:48.801
What do you got
for us over there?

56:48.868 --> 56:50.169
Well...

56:50.236 --> 56:53.706
Mine's kind of a twist
on family legacy.

56:55.808 --> 56:58.878
I know we were supposed to
write something personal...

56:58.944 --> 57:00.980
in our truth, so...

57:01.047 --> 57:03.182
I hope you guys like it.

57:03.249 --> 57:04.884
Let's see...

57:07.286 --> 57:09.221
My story is entitled...

58:08.247 --> 58:11.050
I cannot wait
to see you again.

59:49.848 --> 59:51.116
Is that Helen?

59:52.151 --> 59:53.018
Judith.

59:54.153 --> 59:55.020
Oh yeah.

59:55.888 --> 59:57.022
Who's the guy?

59:57.990 --> 59:59.091
I don't know.

59:59.158 --> 01:00:02.328
I don't know a whole lot
about my birth mother.

01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:05.431
She did leave you this house.

01:00:05.497 --> 01:00:07.266
That was pretty cool.

01:00:18.110 --> 01:00:20.846
Maybe we should keep
some of this stuff.

01:00:20.913 --> 01:00:24.917
That'll save some money
on buying new furniture.

01:00:31.523 --> 01:00:32.858
Anne?

01:00:32.925 --> 01:00:34.360
Yeah.

01:00:34.426 --> 01:00:37.029
That's a good idea. We should.

01:00:39.598 --> 01:00:40.532
You okay?

01:00:48.774 --> 01:00:53.379
I spent my whole life
wondering who my mother was.

01:00:53.445 --> 01:00:54.513
Now it's all right
in front of me,

01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:58.150
and I still don't know
anything about her.

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:02.988
I'm only here because
there was nobody else

01:01:03.055 --> 01:01:04.490
to leave the house.

01:01:09.962 --> 01:01:11.463
Things take time.

01:01:13.065 --> 01:01:16.869
I'm sure it will all
get cleared up soon.

01:01:16.935 --> 01:01:19.138
Hey, do you have the
key to the basement?

01:01:19.204 --> 01:01:20.572
I couldn't open it.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.241
No.

01:01:22.308 --> 01:01:23.108
Can I help you?

01:01:23.175 --> 01:01:24.109
Oh.

01:01:24.176 --> 01:01:25.411
Hello!

01:01:25.477 --> 01:01:28.280
Would you be a dear and
take this from me, please?

01:01:28.347 --> 01:01:29.615
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:01:29.683 --> 01:01:31.550
I was going to ring the bell,

01:01:31.617 --> 01:01:36.455
but the door was left wide
open, so I let myself in.

01:01:36.522 --> 01:01:40.292
You two must be the new
owners of this lovely home.

01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:41.894
How wonderful!

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.195
Yes, I'm David.

01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:44.229
Charmed.

01:01:44.296 --> 01:01:45.964
And this is Anne.

01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:48.367
Hi.

01:01:48.434 --> 01:01:52.237
It is such a pleasure
to finally see you!

01:01:52.304 --> 01:01:54.139
I'm sorry, do I know you?

01:01:54.206 --> 01:01:56.008
I do apologize.

01:01:56.075 --> 01:01:57.376
I am...

01:01:57.443 --> 01:01:59.044
was...

01:01:59.111 --> 01:02:02.047
Judith's dear
friend and neighbor.

01:02:02.114 --> 01:02:04.350
When I found out her daughter
would be taking her place,

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:07.519
I could hardly contain myself!

01:02:07.586 --> 01:02:10.055
Oh, I sure do hope
you like apple pie.

01:02:10.122 --> 01:02:12.591
It's a conjuring of a
secret family recipe.

01:02:12.659 --> 01:02:14.493
My personal favorite.

01:02:17.664 --> 01:02:19.098
So you knew my mother?

01:02:19.164 --> 01:02:20.599
Judith?

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:21.533
Yes.

01:02:23.035 --> 01:02:24.436
She is a treasure.

01:02:26.338 --> 01:02:28.207
Such a generous woman.

01:02:30.142 --> 01:02:32.077
It was a shame...

01:02:32.144 --> 01:02:36.716
the conditions that this
life had presented her with.

01:02:36.783 --> 01:02:41.186
But the time does come to
us all when we must rest.

01:02:45.157 --> 01:02:48.427
I hope you have a
wonderful evening!

01:02:48.494 --> 01:02:53.232
It was certainly a gift to
welcome you to your new home.

01:02:54.366 --> 01:02:55.200
Wait!

01:02:58.036 --> 01:03:00.339
Do you want to come
over for dinner...

01:03:00.406 --> 01:03:01.073
tonight?

01:03:02.174 --> 01:03:04.276
Maybe, if you're not busy.

01:03:05.377 --> 01:03:09.114
I'd just like to
hear more about her.

01:03:09.181 --> 01:03:11.450
I didn't know her very well.

01:03:12.786 --> 01:03:15.921
I didn't know her
at all, actually.

01:03:20.092 --> 01:03:23.128
She was a secretive woman.

01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:26.999
Understandable, given
the times we live in.

01:03:27.065 --> 01:03:30.202
I would be honored to
come by for supper.

01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:32.271
I'll bring us some wine.

01:05:01.694 --> 01:05:02.561
David?

01:05:04.898 --> 01:05:06.298
Yeah?

01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.302
What's the neighbor's name?

01:05:10.369 --> 01:05:11.603
I don't know.

01:05:11.671 --> 01:05:14.273
Probably Agnes or something
old-fashioned like that.

01:05:15.274 --> 01:05:16.141
Why?

01:05:17.276 --> 01:05:18.243
Shouldn't we know
the name of the person

01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:21.446
who's coming over
for dinner tonight?

01:05:22.815 --> 01:05:26.786
I'm just starting to feel
really weird about this.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:30.155
What are you
feeling worried about?

01:05:30.222 --> 01:05:31.557
This!

01:05:31.623 --> 01:05:33.325
This house!

01:05:33.392 --> 01:05:34.259
My mother!

01:05:35.327 --> 01:05:36.128
I didn't even know
she was still alive

01:05:36.194 --> 01:05:39.398
until I found out she was dead.

01:05:39.464 --> 01:05:40.733
It's just a lot.

01:05:45.337 --> 01:05:46.839
Come here.

01:05:46.906 --> 01:05:47.774
Come here.

01:05:50.877 --> 01:05:54.747
I think you're just
stressed from the move.

01:05:54.814 --> 01:05:57.182
Try not to overthink it.

01:05:57.249 --> 01:06:00.085
And just hear what
she has to say.

01:06:01.754 --> 01:06:04.456
It's all gonna be okay.

01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:07.326
You'll get the answers
that you're looking for.

01:06:07.392 --> 01:06:08.594
Hey, I promise.

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:20.172
Look at that!
The bell works after all.

01:06:20.238 --> 01:06:21.573
Please come in.

01:06:21.641 --> 01:06:22.642
Thank you.

01:06:24.677 --> 01:06:26.411
I've always loved this home.

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:30.482
I know the two of you will
find great happiness here.

01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:31.951
David, will you be a dear

01:06:32.018 --> 01:06:33.753
and open this bottle
of wine, please?

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.954
Yes.

01:06:35.021 --> 01:06:36.488
Careful, love!

01:06:37.389 --> 01:06:39.291
That bottle is seen many miles

01:06:39.358 --> 01:06:42.227
and counted far too many
days along its journey here.

01:06:42.294 --> 01:06:45.698
It might very well be
older than yourself.

01:06:47.366 --> 01:06:52.204
I've been saving it for
such an occasion as this.

01:06:58.645 --> 01:06:59.946
Thank you guys so
much for eating the chicken!

01:07:00.013 --> 01:07:01.014
It was delicious!

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:02.314
That oven
cooks way too fast!

01:07:02.381 --> 01:07:05.517
Everything
was wonderful.

01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:06.853
Everything.

01:07:06.919 --> 01:07:09.588
It's been such a lovely evening.

01:07:09.656 --> 01:07:11.758
Thank you both
again for having me.

01:07:11.824 --> 01:07:13.760
Thank you for coming.

01:07:15.828 --> 01:07:18.263
I'm sorry. I can't
remember your name.

01:07:19.132 --> 01:07:19.732
That's quite all right.

01:07:19.799 --> 01:07:20.565
Oh, I'm horrible.

01:07:20.633 --> 01:07:22.669
My name is Esther, my dear.

01:07:22.735 --> 01:07:23.703
Oh, okay.

01:07:24.837 --> 01:07:28.240
It's very nice to meet
you again, Esther.

01:07:28.306 --> 01:07:30.777
And it's a pleasure to see you.

01:07:32.577 --> 01:07:33.612
Now...

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.715
time for one last course.

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:38.283
The pie!

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:38.951
That's right.

01:07:39.018 --> 01:07:40.285
Please, David.

01:07:40.352 --> 01:07:42.487
would you be a gentleman
and prepare a piece for us?

01:07:42.554 --> 01:07:43.622
Absolutely.

01:07:49.762 --> 01:07:50.562
- I know-
- Um-

01:07:51.731 --> 01:07:53.432
Please, continue.

01:07:58.037 --> 01:08:01.941
What can you tell
me about my mother?

01:08:14.619 --> 01:08:15.788
You mother...

01:08:17.522 --> 01:08:18.523
After the...

01:08:19.591 --> 01:08:22.627
unexpected passing
of her dear Adam...

01:08:25.698 --> 01:08:29.367
I wasn't sure how she
would handle herself.

01:08:30.803 --> 01:08:34.674
She just could not go on
without him, I'm afraid.

01:08:34.741 --> 01:08:35.607
Adam.

01:08:36.876 --> 01:08:40.612
That's the man in the
photo next to her, right?

01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:43.683
Were they married?

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:45.718
Inseparable.

01:08:47.787 --> 01:08:49.321
As all of us are.

01:08:51.423 --> 01:08:55.060
So, you guys were
all really close, then?

01:08:55.127 --> 01:08:57.328
Oh, we are very close.

01:08:59.665 --> 01:09:02.600
Nearly family. More
than that, even.

01:09:05.138 --> 01:09:07.106
I have known your mother for...

01:09:07.173 --> 01:09:10.109
what feels like an eternity.

01:09:10.176 --> 01:09:11.844
She's truly a dear.

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:17.984
Quit like yourself,
it would seem.

01:09:18.050 --> 01:09:20.019
Oh, you remind me of
her in so many ways.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.388
Good ways, I hope.

01:09:23.455 --> 01:09:24.724
The best ways.

01:09:26.192 --> 01:09:28.393
You share the same eyes.

01:09:29.162 --> 01:09:30.362
The same smile.

01:09:32.765 --> 01:09:33.698
The same...

01:09:35.001 --> 01:09:35.868
spirit.

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:47.412
You know...

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.783
they say the apple does
not fall far from the tree.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:52.984
I've heard that one.

01:09:53.051 --> 01:09:53.986
Yes.

01:09:55.021 --> 01:09:55.888
Yes.

01:09:57.156 --> 01:10:00.059
But they never do ask
what happens to the apple

01:10:00.126 --> 01:10:02.795
after it hits the ground below.

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:05.463
What happens?

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:07.399
That depends, I suppose,

01:10:07.465 --> 01:10:11.170
on this circumstances
surrounding the fall

01:10:11.237 --> 01:10:14.941
it may be swooped up
by a passing neighbor

01:10:15.007 --> 01:10:17.375
and devoured shortly after.

01:10:18.644 --> 01:10:20.880
Or it may be left to rot...

01:10:22.014 --> 01:10:25.550
and slowly decay into
the earth beneath it.

01:10:26.551 --> 01:10:28.754
Luck of the fall, it seems.

01:10:30.555 --> 01:10:32.024
But not always.

01:10:36.662 --> 01:10:37.997
Not always.

01:10:49.775 --> 01:10:50.776
Sometimes...

01:10:53.578 --> 01:10:54.947
the apple falls...

01:10:56.282 --> 01:10:58.951
only to be caught
by the branches.

01:10:59.018 --> 01:11:02.520
In its resting, the
branches tend to it...

01:11:03.521 --> 01:11:04.522
cradle it...

01:11:05.624 --> 01:11:08.794
until it is ready to
rejoin the vine...

01:11:09.996 --> 01:11:13.866
and regain life through
the roots once more.

01:11:14.734 --> 01:11:17.103
The roots give it strength.

01:11:18.204 --> 01:11:20.006
We are nothing
without our roots.

01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:24.542
Your mother...

01:11:25.978 --> 01:11:26.846
Helen...

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.181
Judith!

01:11:29.248 --> 01:11:32.617
Helen has known many
names over many lifetimes.

01:11:32.685 --> 01:11:36.956
In this very moment,
your mother is resting.

01:11:37.023 --> 01:11:39.158
She has fallen from her vine...

01:11:39.225 --> 01:11:42.560
and she patiently
awaits your arrival.

01:11:43.628 --> 01:11:44.830
You, my dear...

01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:48.100
are her roots...

01:11:48.167 --> 01:11:50.069
the blood of her blood!

01:11:51.704 --> 01:11:53.839
Only you can bring her.

01:11:56.676 --> 01:11:58.044
Oh, you poor dear.

01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:02.181
Don't be afraid, darling.

01:12:03.349 --> 01:12:06.953
You have been given
a wonderful purpose.

01:12:07.019 --> 01:12:10.022
We are not born for
ourselves alone.

01:12:14.994 --> 01:12:15.795
Adam?

01:12:18.764 --> 01:12:20.833
If you would be so kind.

01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:32.912
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:35.247
I can't wait to see you again.

01:17:13.559 --> 01:17:15.294
It was just the first draft.

01:17:15.361 --> 01:17:17.062
What a story, Claire!

01:17:18.632 --> 01:17:21.033
That was quite
impressive. Nicely done.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.303
Thanks, everybody.
It really means a lot.

01:17:24.370 --> 01:17:25.304
Claire...

01:17:26.673 --> 01:17:27.873
What can I say?

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.074
That was...

01:17:29.141 --> 01:17:30.476
That was amazing!

01:17:32.311 --> 01:17:33.879
Everybody! All of you!

01:17:33.946 --> 01:17:36.482
You guys did such an
amazing job today!

01:17:36.548 --> 01:17:39.418
I am, like,
completely blown away!

01:17:41.453 --> 01:17:45.424
Now, normally, this will
conclude our evening, but...

01:17:45.491 --> 01:17:46.425
if I may...

01:17:48.494 --> 01:17:50.496
I was wondering if
you guys might be up

01:17:50.562 --> 01:17:52.564
for just one more story.

01:17:52.632 --> 01:17:53.633
I know, I know.

01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.269
I know normally I
don't do this, but...

01:17:58.705 --> 01:18:01.040
I think you guys might
want to hear this.

01:18:01.106 --> 01:18:02.608
I, for one, wouldn't
want to have to follow

01:18:02.676 --> 01:18:04.310
Claire's story, but...

01:18:04.376 --> 01:18:07.012
You got the sudden
urge to scare us, Pete?

01:18:07.079 --> 01:18:10.082
Oh, you know,
something like that.

01:18:11.718 --> 01:18:14.253
I've actually been
working on this for...

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.587
quite some time.

01:18:16.989 --> 01:18:20.993
It's been just adding little
bits and pieces here and there.

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.895
Wow, that sounds intriguing.

01:18:24.963 --> 01:18:26.231
Okay.

01:18:26.298 --> 01:18:27.232
Here we go.

01:18:39.244 --> 01:18:42.147
The theater closed
around 10 o'clock.

01:18:42.214 --> 01:18:47.086
It was a night like any other
for the remaining employees.

01:18:50.389 --> 01:18:52.424
Kyle finished
sweeping up the lobby

01:18:52.491 --> 01:18:56.061
while Jasmin restocked
the concession stand.

01:18:57.129 --> 01:18:58.997
Finally done!

01:18:59.064 --> 01:19:00.199
I'm so over this gig.

01:19:00.265 --> 01:19:01.266
Did you see the smashed hot dog

01:19:01.333 --> 01:19:03.402
that little asshole
left in the lobby?

01:19:03.469 --> 01:19:04.704
I don't get paid
enough to do this shit!

01:19:04.771 --> 01:19:07.473
Can you just not right now?

01:19:07.539 --> 01:19:08.641
What?

01:19:08.708 --> 01:19:11.410
I'm tired. I wanna go home.

01:19:11.477 --> 01:19:13.946
Just take it up
with Joe tomorrow.

01:19:14.012 --> 01:19:14.613
Fine.

01:19:14.681 --> 01:19:15.948
We're done anyway.

01:19:16.014 --> 01:19:17.149
Think again.

01:19:19.184 --> 01:19:21.153
He's still in there?

01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.588
Movie ended like 10 minutes ago!

01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:24.189
All the while...

01:19:24.256 --> 01:19:26.425
unaware of the black eyes

01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:29.228
that watch them
from the darkness...

01:19:30.295 --> 01:19:32.231
How do you know that?

01:19:33.298 --> 01:19:34.366
Know what?

01:19:34.433 --> 01:19:36.034
It wasn't long before the two

01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:40.005
discovered one still
remained in the theater.

01:19:40.072 --> 01:19:41.407
Can you just
please do your job

01:19:41.473 --> 01:19:42.642
and go kick this
guy out already?

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:44.576
Jeez! All right!

01:19:44.644 --> 01:19:46.979
What do you got,
like a hot day tonight?

01:19:47.045 --> 01:19:48.981
Personally, I wouldn't go out.

01:19:49.047 --> 01:19:51.083
Not with a killer on the loose.

01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:52.017
Just go!

01:19:55.387 --> 01:19:57.122
All right, the movie's over!

01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:58.590
Time to go!

01:19:58.658 --> 01:19:59.759
Kyle...

01:19:59.826 --> 01:20:03.228
Well, he didn't really
put up much of a fight.

01:20:05.799 --> 01:20:06.598
Kyle?

01:20:08.768 --> 01:20:12.204
Can someone please tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:20:13.605 --> 01:20:15.340
Oh, poor Jasmin...

01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:18.444
she was a fighter...

01:20:19.344 --> 01:20:21.013
right up until the very end.

01:20:21.079 --> 01:20:21.681
Kyle?

01:20:29.288 --> 01:20:30.622
This isn't funny.

01:20:55.247 --> 01:20:56.181
Pete?

01:20:56.248 --> 01:20:58.484
But it was no use.

01:20:58.550 --> 01:21:00.118
Her time had come.

01:21:00.753 --> 01:21:02.387
Just like...

01:21:02.454 --> 01:21:04.657
so many before her.

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:22.374
Stop it, Pete!

01:21:22.441 --> 01:21:23.575
Just stop it!

01:21:23.643 --> 01:21:26.144
Oh, but I haven't finished.

01:21:27.379 --> 01:21:29.348
Wait, what's the matter?

01:21:29.414 --> 01:21:30.783
Do you guys not like my story?

01:21:30.850 --> 01:21:34.186
Please tell me that this is
some sort of sick joke, Peter.

01:21:40.425 --> 01:21:42.361
I was afraid
this might happen.

01:21:46.799 --> 01:21:50.302
Do you guys want to know
why Cutthroat wears a mask?

01:21:50.369 --> 01:21:52.237
Well, I'll tell you.

01:21:52.304 --> 01:21:54.106
It's not to hide who he is.

01:21:54.172 --> 01:21:55.541
No.

01:21:55.607 --> 01:21:58.377
It's to mock the ones
who really wear masks,

01:21:58.443 --> 01:22:02.347
masks that others don't
see, but Cutthroat does.

01:22:03.549 --> 01:22:05.417
He sees all of you.

01:22:05.484 --> 01:22:09.856
He sees the lies that you
tell, even to yourselves,

01:22:09.923 --> 01:22:13.693
so afraid of the things
that you wish you could do,

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.093
or say, or be.

01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:19.164
Except...

01:22:19.832 --> 01:22:20.700
for one...

01:22:22.835 --> 01:22:24.369
who's unafraid...

01:22:25.537 --> 01:22:27.139
who wears no mask.

01:22:33.478 --> 01:22:34.079
Fuck this!

01:22:39.217 --> 01:22:40.218
What the fuck?

01:22:40.285 --> 01:22:41.721
I'm gonna
call the police.

01:22:41.788 --> 01:22:42.521
Shit! I can't find it!

01:22:42.588 --> 01:22:43.555
- Claire!
- Damn it!

01:22:43.622 --> 01:22:44.289
Claire!
Claire, get up!

01:22:44.356 --> 01:22:45.324
Come on, we have to go!

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:47.426
- Come on, Claire!
- Guys, guys guys!

01:22:47.492 --> 01:22:48.828
- Claire!
- Shut the fuck up!

01:22:48.895 --> 01:22:50.162
Let's get the fuck
outta here now!

01:22:50.228 --> 01:22:51.496
This way, this way!

01:22:52.464 --> 01:22:53.265
Fuck!

01:22:54.934 --> 01:22:55.935
Uh...

01:22:56.002 --> 01:22:56.602
This way, this way.

01:23:01.239 --> 01:23:03.241
He's surrounding us!

01:23:11.651 --> 01:23:12.517
Diego, behind you!

01:23:15.688 --> 01:23:16.288
No!

01:24:27.927 --> 01:24:28.527
Naomi!

01:24:28.593 --> 01:24:30.562
Help me!

01:24:30.629 --> 01:24:31.798
I don't wanna die!

01:24:31.864 --> 01:24:32.899
I'm so sorry!

01:24:35.068 --> 01:24:36.368
Hello, Naomi.

01:24:37.536 --> 01:24:38.403
Claire!

01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:39.672
We have to go!

01:24:39.739 --> 01:24:41.641
Peter, stop!

01:25:08.134 --> 01:25:10.670
Please don't!

01:25:10.737 --> 01:25:12.038
Please!

01:25:12.105 --> 01:25:13.940
I'm begging you, stop.

01:25:15.007 --> 01:25:17.777
Please don't.

01:25:23.182 --> 01:25:23.783
Wait! No!

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:25.584
Claire!

01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:31.758
No! No!

01:27:57.203 --> 01:27:58.070
Mikey?

01:28:33.239 --> 01:28:34.606
Claire!

01:28:34.674 --> 01:28:35.775
Wait!

01:28:38.244 --> 01:28:39.679
Claire!

01:28:39.745 --> 01:28:40.813
Stop!

01:28:45.651 --> 01:28:46.786
No!

01:29:01.367 --> 01:29:02.668
Claire!

01:29:02.735 --> 01:29:03.535
Claire.

01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:05.204
Get back!

01:29:07.139 --> 01:29:08.841
I just wanna explain.

01:29:08.908 --> 01:29:10.710
I want you to
understand everything.

01:29:10.776 --> 01:29:11.576
Get away!

01:29:11.644 --> 01:29:12.544
Please.

01:29:14.981 --> 01:29:16.182
Oh my God.

01:29:16.248 --> 01:29:18.583
I didn't mean to hurt you.

01:29:20.186 --> 01:29:21.887
Just let me take a look, okay?

01:29:21.954 --> 01:29:24.556
Claire, it's me. I'm
not gonna hurt you.

01:29:24.622 --> 01:29:25.992
Please.

01:29:26.058 --> 01:29:26.926
Oh, shoot.

01:29:27.893 --> 01:29:28.894
Oh, I'm so sorry.

01:29:28.961 --> 01:29:31.097
I'm just gonna dress
this wound, okay?

01:29:31.163 --> 01:29:33.866
Sorry, sorry. I know it hurts.

01:29:33.933 --> 01:29:35.067
I know it hurts.

01:29:36.635 --> 01:29:38.337
You need to apply
pressure, okay?

01:29:38.404 --> 01:29:39.739
Just like that.

01:29:39.805 --> 01:29:41.240
You're going to be okay.

01:29:51.851 --> 01:29:54.053
I'm sorry for all of this.

01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.621
I don't believe you.

01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:59.692
Claire, of all people, I
thought you would understand.

01:29:59.759 --> 01:30:02.895
You see the world
for what it's like.

01:30:02.962 --> 01:30:03.896
Like me.

01:30:03.963 --> 01:30:05.798
I'm nothing like you!

01:30:08.801 --> 01:30:09.668
Mikey?

01:30:11.670 --> 01:30:13.005
Did you kill him?

01:30:20.279 --> 01:30:21.080
Yes.

01:30:24.683 --> 01:30:26.318
Tonight was inevitable.

01:30:26.385 --> 01:30:27.820
I didn't want Mikey
a part of this.

01:30:27.887 --> 01:30:29.755
I wanted him to leave!

01:30:29.822 --> 01:30:31.657
I tried to get him to leave!

01:30:31.724 --> 01:30:33.926
but everybody fought me on it!

01:30:33.993 --> 01:30:35.227
Especially you.

01:30:37.897 --> 01:30:39.165
I'm sorry.

01:30:39.231 --> 01:30:40.866
I know, it's not your fault.
You couldn't have known.

01:30:40.933 --> 01:30:43.502
Don't touch me!
Don't touch me!

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:49.642
My father always
kept me at a distance,

01:30:49.708 --> 01:30:53.712
and I never understood
why, until after he died.

01:30:56.248 --> 01:30:59.385
Even after the
murders stopped...

01:30:59.452 --> 01:31:01.320
nobody put it together?

01:31:02.721 --> 01:31:04.657
Even his own son.

01:31:05.391 --> 01:31:06.325
He was...

01:31:08.027 --> 01:31:09.195
Yes.

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:11.664
He was the first Cutthroat.

01:31:12.898 --> 01:31:15.701
You wanted to know
what this was.

01:31:16.735 --> 01:31:19.138
It was my father's journal.

01:31:19.205 --> 01:31:21.340
You wouldn't do this.

01:31:21.407 --> 01:31:23.175
What happened to you?

01:31:25.211 --> 01:31:26.879
I found my purpose.

01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:31.050
I see the importance
of his work...

01:31:31.117 --> 01:31:33.819
and the legacy that
he left behind.

01:31:33.886 --> 01:31:36.322
What kind of legacy is that?

01:31:38.157 --> 01:31:40.092
I want you to decide.

01:31:41.260 --> 01:31:44.096
You're an incredible
storyteller, Claire.

01:31:44.163 --> 01:31:45.898
It's all right here.

01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:59.145
I'm sorry.

01:32:14.426 --> 01:32:16.896
Cops are on the way and
they should be here...

01:32:16.962 --> 01:32:18.230
any minute.

01:32:18.297 --> 01:32:22.201
They're gonna take good care
of you, fix you right up.

01:32:22.268 --> 01:32:23.869
Take this gift.

01:32:23.936 --> 01:32:26.338
Free yourself from this place.

01:32:27.573 --> 01:32:29.041
Goodbye, Claire.
