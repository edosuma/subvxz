Perhaps later on we could pour
some water on her and watch her melt.

13:48.300 --> 13:51.700
Carlton, do you hear that?

13:51.900 --> 13:53.400
You mean your song on the radio?

13:54.000 --> 13:58.500
No, I mean the cash registers
racking up my record sales.

13:58.600 --> 14:00.700
Isn't she funny?

14:00.900 --> 14:05.100
Don't just stand there, Ashley.
Call him a good boy and toss him a treat.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.200
Will, don't be mad.
I'm thanking you on my album cover.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.400
Oh, really? So thanks.
What the hell is my problem?

14:15.600 --> 14:19.400
There she is, America's sweetheart.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.700
Watch the hair!

14:21.900 --> 14:24.400
I have some very exciting news for you.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.900
Make it quick.
Miss Banks has to mentally prepare...

14:27.100 --> 14:29.500
...for her appearance tomorrow
at Dad's record store.

14:30.100 --> 14:32.300
I have the greatest idea for my talk show.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.100
It's a salute to divas.

14:34.300 --> 14:38.000
Past, present and future.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.200
Hilary, that is my idea.

14:41.400 --> 14:46.200
Right, just like you launched
Ashley's career? So how about it, Ash?

14:46.300 --> 14:50.200
Hilary, it sounds really wonderful
and I'd love to do it...

14:50.400 --> 14:53.000
...but, well, my managers
have this silly little idea...

14:53.100 --> 14:55.500
...about me only doing important shows.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.900
<i>Oh, so, what you doing, 60 Minutes?</i>

15:01.700 --> 15:03.800
So young, so bitter.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.100
Carlton!

15:19.100 --> 15:22.400
Oh, she is so self-centered.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.400
I hear that.
After everything I've done for her.

15:25.500 --> 15:27.500
You? Who's talking about you?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.100
Well, I'm talking about Miss Thing.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.000
Somebody need to snatch her big
helium head down out the stratosphere.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.100
Excuse me, I need to talk to Queen Sheba.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.100
Alone.

15:51.500 --> 15:57.100
Will, I never wanted to fire you.

15:58.100 --> 16:00.500
- Really?
- Of course not.

16:00.700 --> 16:04.800
I would have been happy paying you a token
salary while someone else did the real work.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.900
I discovered you.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.700
And don't think I'm not grateful...

16:11.900 --> 16:15.400
...but it's time for me
to take my career to the next plateau.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.800
And, face it, you're small potatoes.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.600
Small potatoes?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.800
I'll show you how small my potatoes are.

16:32.300 --> 16:34.800
Carlton!

16:39.600 --> 16:41.100
Sorry, no. Next.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.500
Sorry, too tall.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.100
You're a little too big-boned.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.400
Well, okay. Okay.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.500
Get a tan.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.500
No. No.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.500
No. Would you think?

17:07.900 --> 17:10.400
Hey, Will, look what I found.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.700
Jazz, she looks just like Ashley.

17:14.099 --> 17:16.900
The resemblance, much like the beat,
goes on.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.599
Sing something, honey.

17:19.800 --> 17:25.000
<i>Although I'm crazy about ya
I can live without ya</i>

17:25.500 --> 17:28.099
<i>And you wasted my time</i>

17:28.900 --> 17:30.500
[LAUGHS]

17:30.800 --> 17:33.100
Jazz, she's great. I'm back!

17:33.300 --> 17:37.800
You? Get your own client.
This one's mine.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.500
Come on, Bashley.

17:45.600 --> 17:50.600
What are you doing here? Doesn't
Ashley got some boots that need licking?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.200
Well, she found out I was skimming money
off the top, so she fired me.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.300
Her own brother.

17:56.500 --> 18:01.100
Face it, man, family means nothing to
Ashley no more. Look what she did to me.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.500
Well, at least you still have
your 15 percent.

18:03.600 --> 18:06.200
All I got was a promise
she wouldn't press charges.

18:07.300 --> 18:09.200
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Whoa.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.000
What are you talking about?
I don't have no 15 percent.

18:12.200 --> 18:15.700
Will, you had an oral agreement
with Ashley. That's legally binding.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.700
Just ask Kim Basinger.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.300
You're right, man,
I didn't even think about that.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.700
Thanks a lot, C. I think I'll
slide down to this record store...

18:25.900 --> 18:28.500
...and give the good news
to Little Miss Fat Head.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.300
Where are all the people?

18:43.400 --> 18:45.900
Philip, I don't know,
but you've gotta do something.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.000
She's been sitting there for hours.

18:49.900 --> 18:54.400
Hey, kid, how'd you like to have your own
personal CD of "Make Up Your Mind"?

18:54.600 --> 18:57.000
Man, that song is weak.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.800
Last week.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.900
- I thought you said it was gonna be a hit.
- It was.

19:04.100 --> 19:08.000
We had such positive feedback that we
threw extra promotional muscle behind it...

19:08.200 --> 19:11.100
...saturated our key demo playlist
and topped out.

19:12.100 --> 19:15.200
- What does that mean?
- The kids got sick of her.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.300
Hey, what's up, y'all? How you doing?

19:21.400 --> 19:25.000
Man, let's see, I guess I'll get one of these.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.500
Nas in the house.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.000
<i>- Oh, Partners In Rhyme. I love that CD.
- What are you doing?</i>

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
Oh, I just want my piece of the pie.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.700
Well, you know, seeing as how Ashley and I
have a legally binding oral agreement...

19:37.900 --> 19:41.200
...which guarantees my 15 percent.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.800
[CHUCKLES]

19:43.200 --> 19:47.100
I guess you got me there.
So tell me something.

19:47.300 --> 19:49.500
How much is 15 percent of nothing?

19:49.600 --> 19:54.400
It's... Okay, 15.
Hold up, 15, carry the zero. Fifteen...

19:54.600 --> 20:00.200
Nothing, you math whiz.
Fifteen percent of nothing is nothing.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.400
All right, what are you talking about?

20:02.600 --> 20:05.100
PHIL: Well, evidently Ashley
is not gonna be as big a star...

20:05.300 --> 20:07.100
...as they thought she was going to be.

20:07.800 --> 20:11.500
- And I can't say that I'm not happy about it.
- Me either.

20:12.600 --> 20:17.700
Well, it's nice to know
my family was rooting for me to fail.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.900
Ashley, that is not at all what we...
Ashley.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.900
- This is all your fault, Will.
- This is all your fault, Will.

20:33.100 --> 20:37.200
<i>ASHLEY [SINGING ON RADIO]:
Tell me why you're playing with my mind, boy</i>

20:41.800 --> 20:44.200
Hey, Ashley.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.700
Hey, you mind signing my CD?

20:47.900 --> 20:50.000
Very funny.

20:50.500 --> 20:55.200
No, come on. I'm being serious. One day
you're gonna be famous in something...

20:55.300 --> 20:59.100
...and a signed CD is gonna be
worth some real dough.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.100
Or if not, we can use it to prop up
an unlevel table.

21:03.200 --> 21:04.600
You know, so it don't wobble.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.700
- Is that a smile?
- No.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.600
Yes.

21:14.900 --> 21:19.700
Why are you being so nice to me?
I was such a jerk.

21:19.900 --> 21:22.300
Well, you learned from the master.

21:24.500 --> 21:28.100
Look, this whole thing
had us all acting a little crazy.

21:28.300 --> 21:31.500
Hey, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we forget the apologies...

21:31.700 --> 21:34.700
...call it even. Deal?

21:35.000 --> 21:36.400
Deal.

21:36.600 --> 21:39.400
Come here. Come here. Come here.

21:41.700 --> 21:44.500
[CRYING]

21:45.500 --> 21:46.800
- Will?
- Hmm?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.200
Are you crying too?

21:50.800 --> 21:53.300
No, cold-and-flu season.

21:56.500 --> 21:59.700
Oh, you guys.
