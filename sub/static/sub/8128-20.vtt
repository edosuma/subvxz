How long has Lionel             
known this girl?                

00:56.356 --> 00:57.889
            About two months.   

00:57.891 --> 01:01.760
Only two months                 
and they're engaged already?    

01:01.762 --> 01:06.230
        That's right. I blame it
        on daylight-saving time.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.465
    Oh.                         

01:07.467 --> 01:09.668
Well, when I was young,         

01:09.670 --> 01:12.871
if a girl was going with a boy  
only two months,                

01:12.873 --> 01:15.306
they were still strangers.      

01:15.308 --> 01:18.810
Why, I knew Archie              
a whole year                    

01:18.812 --> 01:21.713
before I even found out         
he was ticklish.                

01:21.715 --> 01:22.847
                  How did you--?

01:22.849 --> 01:24.749
        How did you find out?   

01:24.751 --> 01:26.051
It was an accident.             

01:26.053 --> 01:27.451
We was on the beach,            

01:27.453 --> 01:31.222
and I was smearing suntan oil   
on Archie's back,               

01:31.224 --> 01:34.592
and my hand slipped             
and slid along his ribs.        

01:34.594 --> 01:36.828
        [BOTH LAUGHING]         

01:36.830 --> 01:38.262
You should have seen him!       

01:38.264 --> 01:41.800
He jumped 3 feet!               

01:41.802 --> 01:45.603
There's one other place         
that Archie's ticklish,         

01:45.605 --> 01:49.540
but I didn't find that out      
till after we was married.      

01:55.214 --> 01:58.683
The soles of his feet!          

02:00.853 --> 02:03.054
                    Well, Edith,

02:03.056 --> 02:05.757
             are gonna be home  
          in the next half-hour?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.058
Yeah. Why?                      

02:07.060 --> 02:09.127
            Because Lionel said 
          he wanted to drop over

02:09.128 --> 02:10.794
                and introduce   
                    his fiancée.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.030
Oh! Good.                       

02:12.032 --> 02:15.066
              Oh, by the way,   
        a week from Saturday,   

02:15.068 --> 02:16.901
            we are having       
          a big engagement party

02:16.903 --> 02:18.469
             and you're invited.

02:18.471 --> 02:19.637
  Wonderful.                    

02:19.639 --> 02:22.240
        You and Mike and Gloria.

02:24.110 --> 02:25.276
And...                          

02:25.278 --> 02:27.578
                 No ands, Edith.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.880
What about Archie?              

02:28.882 --> 02:30.715
          Archie is not invited.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.516
        Edith, let's face it.   

02:32.518 --> 02:34.919
            Archie and George   
         can't stand each other.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.488
      Put them in the same room 
     together, the party's over.

02:37.490 --> 02:38.757
But, Louise--                   

02:38.759 --> 02:41.092
      Even if we invited Archie,
        he wouldn't come.       

02:41.094 --> 02:43.995
         Believe me, Edith,     
    we'll be making Archie happy

02:43.997 --> 02:45.930
            by <i>not</i> inviting him.

02:45.932 --> 02:51.369
Well, that's very thoughtful    
of you, Louise.                 

02:51.371 --> 02:52.771
                  Well, I'm glad
                 that's settled.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.038
Well, can I help you            

02:54.040 --> 02:55.940
with any of the baking          
or cooking?                     

02:55.942 --> 02:57.375
          Oh, no. Not this time.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.010
                It's going to be
            a catered affair.   

02:59.012 --> 03:01.880
            We are hiring a room
        at the Monarch Hotel.   

03:01.882 --> 03:04.048
Oh, my!                         
                 So long, Edith.

03:04.050 --> 03:06.450
        Ah-ha! Back, back, back,
            the two of youse.   

03:06.452 --> 03:09.453
        Here's a surprise.      
 Get back there, get back there.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.556
  You'll never guess who I just 
met coming over here to see you.

03:12.558 --> 03:14.725
                     Lionel     
                and his fiancée.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.902
        That is so dumb,        
        answering quick         

03:23.904 --> 03:25.904
          without even          
     taking time to think!      

03:27.306 --> 03:29.407
          I'm sorry, Archie.    

03:29.409 --> 03:31.009
         What's the surprise?   

03:31.011 --> 03:34.145
    Lionel and his fiancée.     

03:34.147 --> 03:36.314
    Is the surprise over yet?   

03:36.316 --> 03:37.315
Yeah, yeah, get in here.        

03:37.317 --> 03:38.783
EDITH: Hello, Lionel.           
                Hi, Mrs. Bunker.

03:38.785 --> 03:40.318
            I'd like you to meet
            Jennie Willis.      

03:40.320 --> 03:42.620
Oh, how do you do,              
Jennie?                         

03:42.622 --> 03:43.788
      Hello, Mrs. Bunker.       

03:43.790 --> 03:45.890
        Lionel's told me        
    so much about you.          

03:45.892 --> 03:47.959
Nothing bad,                    
I hope.                         

03:47.961 --> 03:51.196
              Oh, don't put her 
             on the spot, Edith.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.264
Ain't she pretty!               

03:53.266 --> 03:55.200
  Yes. Lionel's a good picker.  

03:55.202 --> 03:57.335
     Just like his father!      

04:00.206 --> 04:03.107
Well, Jennie's                  
a good picker too.              

04:03.109 --> 04:04.242
     Oh, thank you, Mrs. Bunker.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.243
    I wanna tell you, Lionel,   

04:05.245 --> 04:06.377
              it's a good thing,

04:06.379 --> 04:08.313
and I like it very much,        
your getting engaged.           

04:08.315 --> 04:10.315
I hope you're gonna follow      
through and get married.        

04:10.317 --> 04:12.450
                    Oh, yeah.   

04:12.452 --> 04:13.684
     Right.                     

04:13.686 --> 04:17.154
      So, uh, when are youse two
          gonna tie the knot,   

04:17.156 --> 04:18.422
                 you and your   
              impending husband?

04:18.423 --> 04:20.358
    Well,                       

04:20.360 --> 04:22.560
Lionel and I had                
a long talk about that,         

04:22.562 --> 04:25.429
and we decided to wait          
until after Lionel graduates,   

04:25.431 --> 04:26.931
because A, statistics show      

04:26.933 --> 04:28.799
that the greatest amount        
of stress in a marriage         

04:28.801 --> 04:30.034
occurs during                   
that first year.                

04:30.036 --> 04:32.636
And that would be too much      
of a burden to put on Lionel    

04:32.638 --> 04:33.905
while he's still                
at school.                      

04:33.907 --> 04:37.175
B, if we wait,                  
I could quit school,            

04:37.177 --> 04:39.577
go to work so that we'll have   
that nice little nest egg       

04:39.579 --> 04:41.946
to fall back on until           
Lionel finds a position.        

04:41.948 --> 04:45.716
And C, after Lionel             
establishes himself,            

04:45.718 --> 04:48.286
I can go back to school,        
complete my education           

04:48.288 --> 04:50.788
and pick up                     
on my own career.               

04:54.426 --> 04:57.528
      Ain't she something?      

04:57.530 --> 05:01.399
        I guess you know        
      what you're doing, Lionel.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.901
Lionel, it's                    
really getting late,            

05:02.903 --> 05:04.302
and I've got                    
to be going, so...              

05:04.304 --> 05:05.469
EDITH:                          
So soon?                        

05:05.471 --> 05:07.605
            Oh, yes. I've got   
         a million things to do.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.540
        Would you believe       
      I still don't have a dress

05:09.542 --> 05:11.142
    for our engagement party?   

05:11.144 --> 05:12.143
                        Bye-bye.
              Bye.              

05:12.145 --> 05:13.411
EDITH: Goodbye.                 

05:17.049 --> 05:18.883
I must say that                 
that's a very nice thing        

05:18.885 --> 05:20.184
you're doing there,             
Mrs. J,                         

05:20.186 --> 05:21.786
giving the kids                 
an engagement party.            

05:21.788 --> 05:23.388
              Oh, it's not much.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.589
             We're just inviting
            the immediate family

05:25.591 --> 05:27.191
        and a few close friends.

05:27.193 --> 05:29.394
Oh, swell. I'll be there.       

05:29.396 --> 05:30.962
              Huh?              

05:32.231 --> 05:35.033
Yeah. I'll even bring           
the kids a present.             

05:35.035 --> 05:36.700
            Oh, no. You see--   

05:36.702 --> 05:38.303
Oh, no, no trouble at all.      

05:38.305 --> 05:40.939
     Mrs. J, you must know      
    how I feel about Lionel.    

05:40.941 --> 05:42.407
 I mean, I like him very much.  

05:42.409 --> 05:44.208
 I practically watched the kid  
            grow up.            

05:44.210 --> 05:48.246
Archie, you've only known Lionel
          four years.           

05:48.248 --> 05:51.249
    But them were four very     
    important years, Edith.     

05:51.251 --> 05:52.417
    Them were the four years    

05:52.419 --> 05:54.986
    when the boy was coming     
     into his pubertyhood.      

05:57.957 --> 05:59.357
             But really, Archie,
                 you don't--    

05:59.359 --> 06:00.891
No, no, no, no.                 

06:00.893 --> 06:02.660
I mean, it's gonna be           
a real pleasure,                

06:02.662 --> 06:04.562
    because after all,          
        Lionel and me--         

06:04.564 --> 06:06.464
     When Lionel first come     
     to this neighborhood,      

06:06.466 --> 06:09.367
         you remember,          
I took him under my wing.       

06:09.369 --> 06:13.271
    Being colored, naturally    
     he was a little green.     

06:15.807 --> 06:17.475
I taught him a few things,      

06:17.477 --> 06:18.642
    we become friends.          

06:18.644 --> 06:20.311
 No, I'm gonna make that party. 

06:20.313 --> 06:22.413
    I'm gonna be there          
    with the bells on.          

06:22.415 --> 06:23.714
            I gotta get home.   

06:23.716 --> 06:25.350
            George's dinner's

        something for granted   

06:38.331 --> 06:40.898
                about           
        the engagement party?   

06:40.900 --> 06:42.367
What are you talking about?     

06:42.369 --> 06:44.435
     Well, I heard you say      
        you was coming,         

06:44.437 --> 06:47.671
  but I didn't hear Louise say  
        you was invited.        

06:47.673 --> 06:49.607
Oh, use your head, Edith.

 You heard what the woman said. 

06:51.378 --> 06:54.078
      The immediate family      
    and a few close friends.

  Who could be closer than us?  
    We live next door.

  No way, Louise, you hear me?  

06:59.452 --> 07:01.119
No way!

07:06.626 --> 07:08.226

                George?

                  to me, George.

07:41.227 --> 07:44.495
     I am not crazy about Archie
     coming to our party either.

                 invite him.

            friend of mine,

            What can I do?      

07:57.277 --> 07:59.677
You can take your big mouth back
over there and uninvite him,

that's what you can do!         

08:01.448 --> 08:04.048
                I can't do that!

08:04.050 --> 08:05.716
Why? Because you're afraid      
of hurting his feelings?        

08:05.718 --> 08:07.017
You just blame it               
on me.                          

08:07.019 --> 08:08.819

12:15.201 --> 12:17.234
                      Yeah.     

12:21.973 --> 12:26.377
      Well, there you go.       
  What did I tell you, stupid?  

12:26.379 --> 12:28.879
            And you, Edith,     
    don't you feel dopey now?   

12:28.881 --> 12:33.684
Oh, yeah. I guess               
I got it all mixed up.          

12:33.686 --> 12:36.053
"Got it all mixed up." Mixed up.

12:36.055 --> 12:39.523
    I bet I miss a lot          
    of invitations this way.    

12:49.033 --> 12:51.335
[CONVERSATION & LAUGHTER]       

12:51.337 --> 12:54.204
         Oh, excuse me,         
    will you, please?           

12:55.774 --> 12:59.610
Oh, I'm so glad to see you      
      enjoying yourselves.      

12:59.612 --> 13:01.311
            Ted just told me    
              the funniest joke.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.646
                It's about these
            two white dudes--   

13:02.648 --> 13:06.216
      Shh! Not in front of      
        the help.               

13:12.891 --> 13:15.493
    Well, is everything okay,   
        Mother Jefferson?       

13:15.495 --> 13:17.795
  As well as can be expected    

13:17.797 --> 13:22.199
 considering nobody's paying    
    any attention to me.        

13:22.201 --> 13:26.003
My son George has hardly        
 said a word to me all night.   

13:26.005 --> 13:28.939
    But George can't help it.   
 He's very busy with the guests.

13:28.941 --> 13:31.409
    Too busy to speak           
    to his own mother?          

13:31.411 --> 13:33.544
                 How do you like
                    the food?   

13:33.546 --> 13:36.313
        Let's not start         
      an argument, Louise.      

13:36.315 --> 13:39.917
 Now, listen, you know all you  
had to do was come to me,       

13:39.919 --> 13:43.987
     and I would've fixed       
some real food for this party.  

13:43.989 --> 13:45.723
     You spend enough time      
        in the kitchen.         

13:45.725 --> 13:47.458
  We wanted you to be a guest.  

13:47.460 --> 13:49.192
    Hmph. What difference       
        does it make?           

13:49.194 --> 13:52.195
 Nobody talks to me, anyway.    

13:52.197 --> 13:54.665
                Excuse me.      

13:54.667 --> 13:57.367
        George. George!         

13:57.369 --> 13:58.636
George, what have               
you been doing?                 

13:58.638 --> 14:00.137
        Enjoying myself. Why?   

14:00.139 --> 14:02.840
Well, why don't you             
make yourself useful?           

14:02.842 --> 14:03.841
                 Like what?     

14:03.843 --> 14:07.377
Like getting your mother        
off my back.                    

14:07.379 --> 14:08.679
              What's the matter 
                 with Mama?     

14:08.681 --> 14:10.981
Oh, don't get me                
started on that, George.        

14:10.983 --> 14:12.583
Now get over there              
and talk to her.                

14:12.585 --> 14:15.686
                Let me get me   
                  a drink first.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.321
Hey. How's it                   
going, Pop?                     

14:17.323 --> 14:19.623
            Hey, son.           
              How are you?      

14:19.625 --> 14:21.625
      You take good care of this
        pretty little lady now. 

14:21.627 --> 14:22.927
Yeah,                           
I'll do that.                   

14:22.929 --> 14:25.863
  I like your family, Lionel.   
     They all seem so nice.     

14:25.865 --> 14:27.865
Oh, they got you                
fooled too, huh?                

14:27.867 --> 14:29.066
Listen, what happened           
to your folks?                  

14:29.068 --> 14:30.367
        They'll be here soon.   

14:30.369 --> 14:35.105
     Lionel, have you told your 
    father about my parents yet?

14:35.107 --> 14:36.640
Oh, you mean about them         
being werewolves?               

14:36.642 --> 14:38.175
                 Oh, be serious.

14:38.177 --> 14:39.577
No, no,                         
there's some things             

14:39.579 --> 14:41.779
you don't tell my father        
till it's too late.             

14:41.781 --> 14:43.413
                 But, Lionel,   
                 I'm worried!   

14:43.415 --> 14:45.649
Listen, relax.                  
Everything's gonna be okay.     

14:47.586 --> 14:50.220
    Here, here! Lionel, didn't I
     teach you better than that?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.255
Ain't I doing                   
it right?                       

14:55.927 --> 14:58.228
                Look, lighten up
                  on the girl.  

14:58.230 --> 15:01.031
        Leave her enough lips   
              to say, "I do."   

15:06.270 --> 15:09.239
        Hi, Mama.               
     Everything all right?      

15:09.241 --> 15:14.044
                  Oh, everything
                 is just lovely.

15:17.482 --> 15:19.617
But Louise said you were        
upset about something.          

15:19.619 --> 15:23.453
                Wherever did she
                 get that idea? 

15:23.455 --> 15:27.457
                Why, George,    
            it's a lovely party.

15:27.459 --> 15:30.427
    And don't you worry about   
         the food being skimpy. 

15:30.429 --> 15:33.531
                I'm sure nobody 
            will notice that.   

15:35.366 --> 15:37.001
                George, that's  
              your second drink?

15:37.003 --> 15:38.536
Yes, this is                    
my second drink, Ma.            

15:38.538 --> 15:39.937
                 I'll finish    
                 it for you.    

15:39.939 --> 15:41.939
Mama, you don't have            
to finish the drink for me.     

15:41.941 --> 15:43.774
          George, you know,     
    you're just like your daddy.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.912
  He couldn't drink. I had to do
all the drinking for him too.   

15:50.448 --> 15:55.019
    Come on, Archie,            
this is the party.              

15:55.021 --> 15:57.955
 Oh, Edith, you don't have to be
 nervous with the colored crowd.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.190
                    Just keep   
                 your eye on me.

16:00.192 --> 16:01.725
                    MAN: Hey.   
                 Hi.            

16:01.727 --> 16:04.294
     If you're looking for the  
  Elks Club, it's down the hall.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.631
        Ah, no, no. I ain't     
looking for that. No, ah, no.   

16:07.633 --> 16:09.934
                  Do I look like
                      an elk?   

16:09.936 --> 16:12.369
                      Oh, hello,
                    you two.    

16:12.371 --> 16:13.771
    Hi there, Mrs. J.           
Hello, Louise.                  

16:13.773 --> 16:15.405
             Oh, so nice of you 
              to come, Archie.  

16:15.407 --> 16:17.441
         Yeah, I know.          

16:18.910 --> 16:21.779
Where is Mike and Gloria?       
I don't see them.               

16:21.781 --> 16:24.181
Oh, they're over at our house   
      picking up some records.  

16:24.183 --> 16:25.583
Oh, that's nice.                
        Oh, yeah.               

16:25.585 --> 16:26.984
            Now, can I introduce
              you to everybody? 

16:26.986 --> 16:28.586
    Well, to tell you           
      the truth, Mrs. J--       

16:28.588 --> 16:30.387
             Or would you rather
             have a drink first?

16:30.389 --> 16:32.990
  That's the guy I wanna meet,  
the bartender. Yeah, yeah.      

16:32.992 --> 16:35.960
                Oh, look.       
        Hello, Mr. Jefferson.   

16:35.962 --> 16:36.994
         Oh, hi,                
    Mrs. Bunker.                

16:36.996 --> 16:38.796
          Hey, Jefferson, there.
            How are you?        

16:38.798 --> 16:40.030
                         Listen,

16:40.032 --> 16:42.365
 that formal invitation you sent
          by your wife,         

16:42.367 --> 16:45.535
        I think that was        
    very white of you.          

16:51.710 --> 16:55.746
 That's exactly the way I felt  
         when I did it.         

16:55.748 --> 16:58.548
        George, why don't you   
     take Archie over to the bar

16:58.550 --> 16:59.783
          and offer him a drink?

17:01.252 --> 17:02.786
                 Hey, Jefferson.

17:02.788 --> 17:05.222
          I seen you hosing down
        your porch yesterday.   

17:05.223 --> 17:08.391
Oh, yeah? When am I going to    
see you hosing down yours?      

17:09.560 --> 17:10.627
Bartender.                      

17:10.630 --> 17:11.662
                    Yes, sir?   

17:11.664 --> 17:12.863
Get the man                     
a drink, please.                

17:12.865 --> 17:14.464
        What will it be, sir?   
        Uh, whiskey.            

17:14.465 --> 17:15.699
     Any particular brand?      

17:15.701 --> 17:17.233
      Yeah. The expensive brand.

17:17.236 --> 17:19.136
                         Ha!    

17:22.440 --> 17:23.573
                  And what about
                     you, sir?  

17:23.575 --> 17:24.608
Scotch and soda,                
please.                         

17:24.609 --> 17:25.909
                    Yes, sir.   

17:25.911 --> 17:28.211
          Hey, hey, Jefferson,  
    there's a switch for you,   

17:28.213 --> 17:30.648
             this guy giving you
             the big "Yes, sir."

17:30.650 --> 17:32.516
Why? He's the bartender,        
ain't he?                       

17:32.518 --> 17:33.717
                  Yeah, but what
                    I meant was 

17:33.719 --> 17:36.186
        I'm used to having it   
            the other way round.

17:36.188 --> 17:37.454
Oh, yeah?                       

17:37.456 --> 17:39.723
How many servants you got       
in that mansion you living in?  

17:39.725 --> 17:41.959
    What do you mean by that?   

17:41.961 --> 17:43.593
Let me tell you                 
something about people.         

17:43.595 --> 17:46.030
                  There you are.
Thank you.                      

17:46.032 --> 17:48.231
That bartender's                
willing to work for me,         

17:48.233 --> 17:50.300
because if you got              
enough green in your pocket,    

17:50.302 --> 17:53.537
then black becomes              
his favorite color.             

18:00.845 --> 18:04.247
            George,             
    that's your third drink.    

18:04.249 --> 18:05.315
I know that!                    

18:05.317 --> 18:06.383
    Well, put it down.          

18:06.385 --> 18:07.851
Mama, will you                  
leave me alone, please?         

18:07.853 --> 18:09.619
      I said put it down.       
    You've had enough.          

18:09.621 --> 18:11.021
Look, Mama,                     
I'm a big boy now.              

18:11.023 --> 18:13.023
I don't need you                
to blow my nose for me.         

18:13.025 --> 18:14.224
Now, will you                   
leave me alone?                 

18:14.226 --> 18:15.592
        George...               

18:15.594 --> 18:16.994
     Hey, there, Jefferson.     

18:16.996 --> 18:18.195
     That ain't very nice,      

18:18.197 --> 18:20.764
        talking that way        
to your little mammy here.      

18:26.671 --> 18:29.639
    Who you calling "mammy"?    

18:29.641 --> 18:30.741
                            You.

18:30.743 --> 18:32.910
            Well, don't you dare
              call me "mammy."  

18:32.912 --> 18:35.846
             I'm nobody's mammy.
            I'm his mother.     

18:35.848 --> 18:38.015
              Now, if you got   
          anything to say to me,

18:38.017 --> 18:40.350
                you call me     
                 Mrs. Jefferson.

18:40.352 --> 18:41.651
     Jeez, Mrs. Jefferson--     

18:41.653 --> 18:42.720
    Don't talk to me.           

18:42.722 --> 18:43.921
That's telling him, Ma.         

18:43.923 --> 18:45.956
    And don't you try           
    to make up to me either.    

18:45.958 --> 18:47.524
     Oh, Mother Jefferson,      
         what's wrong?          

18:47.526 --> 18:49.093
Oh, don't.                      
I'm getting out of here.        

18:49.095 --> 18:50.894
 George, what's going on?       

18:50.896 --> 18:52.295
         He called Mama "mammy."

18:52.297 --> 18:54.164
         Oh!                    

18:54.166 --> 18:55.933
            I didn't think      
      I was doing nothing wrong.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.935
    I thought all colored people
      call their mothers Mammy. 

18:57.937 --> 18:59.436
         Well, I did, Jefferson.

18:59.438 --> 19:00.670
  That's what I always heard.   

19:00.672 --> 19:04.307
Jeez, Al Jolson called          
his mother Mammy for years.     

19:06.211 --> 19:07.711
            See that, Louise?   
                    You see?    

19:07.713 --> 19:10.214
             That's what you get
            for inviting whites.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.015
        Hi. How are you?        

19:12.017 --> 19:13.083
Fine.                           

19:13.085 --> 19:14.251
      Oh, hey!                  

19:14.253 --> 19:17.020
Uh, hey, if you're looking      
for the Elks Club,              

19:17.022 --> 19:18.222
it's down the hall.             

19:18.224 --> 19:20.824
            No, thanks.         
         I'm in the right place.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.893
Oh, yeah? What are you,         
the caterer?                    

19:22.895 --> 19:24.027
                             No.

19:24.029 --> 19:26.596
So, what are you                
doing here, a white guy?        

19:26.598 --> 19:27.631
                    I'm a guest.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.299
        What are you doing here,
              a white guy?      

19:29.301 --> 19:32.302
I'm the family's                
white friend.                   

19:34.572 --> 19:36.774
            Jennie!             

19:36.776 --> 19:39.810
                Oh, Mom! Hi!    
            You look beautiful! 

19:39.812 --> 19:42.079
Oh, so do you, baby.            
So do you.                      

19:42.081 --> 19:43.513
You see that little girl        
over there?                     

19:43.515 --> 19:45.115
That's the little girl          
Lionel's going to marry.        

19:45.117 --> 19:47.084
            I know. Know who    
    that lady is hugging her?   

19:47.086 --> 19:48.085
      No.                       

19:48.087 --> 19:49.319
                  She's my wife.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.354
Oh, that--                      
Huh?                            

19:56.194 --> 19:58.395
             Daddy!             
     Hey, Jennie!               

19:58.397 --> 20:00.197
              Hi.               
             Oh, hi, Mr. Willis.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.298
Hi, Lionel.                     

20:01.300 --> 20:02.766
                Oh, I see you've
                 met Mr. Bunker.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.867
      Oh, yeah,                 
      we've met.                

20:03.869 --> 20:05.269
Yeah, yeah.                     

20:05.271 --> 20:06.870
      Lionel, shouldn't we      
 introduce my parents to yours? 

20:06.872 --> 20:08.638
                      Oh, yeah, 
                     yeah, sure.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.407
Now, wait a minute.             
Wait a minute, Lionel!          

20:10.409 --> 20:14.678
Hey! Do you mean to tell me that
your father ain't met that man? 

20:14.680 --> 20:16.546
          Uh, no, I'm going to  
    introduce them right now.   

20:16.548 --> 20:18.816
This I got to see.              

20:18.818 --> 20:20.017
            Mom, Pop.           

20:20.019 --> 20:21.418
      Could you come over       
         here a second?         

20:21.420 --> 20:23.253
    I got some people           
      I want you to meet.       

20:23.255 --> 20:25.588
        Hey, Jefferson,         
    you're gonna love this.     

20:27.658 --> 20:29.693
     Okay, okay, Mom, Pop,      
this is Jennie's parents,       

20:29.695 --> 20:30.627
      Mr. and Mrs. Willis.      

20:33.731 --> 20:34.932
Uh...                           

20:34.934 --> 20:36.900
I'm very pleased                
to meet you.                    

20:36.902 --> 20:37.901
                  How do you do?

20:37.903 --> 20:40.103
Mrs. Jefferson.                 

20:40.105 --> 20:41.205
Mr. Jefferson.                  

20:44.275 --> 20:45.709
                You're white!   

20:46.945 --> 20:49.012
And you're black.               

20:49.014 --> 20:52.115
It's a kick in the head,        
ain't it?                       

20:58.323 --> 20:59.990
                         Lionel,

20:59.992 --> 21:01.225
            I want              
          to talk to you.       

21:01.227 --> 21:02.392
        You know,               
        Jefferson,              

21:02.394 --> 21:03.994
        all the chickens        
coming home to the roost--      

21:03.996 --> 21:05.028
            Please!             

21:05.030 --> 21:06.063
There's not one--               

21:06.065 --> 21:09.199
     Would you just             
excuse us, please?              

21:09.201 --> 21:10.734
        Listen, you know        
         what I think?          

21:10.736 --> 21:13.203
      Would you                 
  excuse us, please?            

21:13.205 --> 21:16.639
         What the hell?         
      I'll eat something.       

21:18.176 --> 21:20.077
Jennie, you didn't              
tell them, did you?             

21:20.079 --> 21:21.144
              No.               

21:21.146 --> 21:22.612
     Why? Are you ashamed of us?

21:22.614 --> 21:23.914
          No, you know          
    better than that.           

21:23.916 --> 21:25.015
                    Then why?   

21:25.017 --> 21:26.383
    Well, I wanted to.          

21:26.385 --> 21:28.551
    But Lionel thought          
it would be better to wait      

21:28.553 --> 21:30.220
    because his father is--     

21:30.222 --> 21:31.654
He certainly is.                

21:31.656 --> 21:33.957
    George, I thought           
you said you liked Jennie.      

21:33.959 --> 21:35.158
That's before I met him.        
                        Wait.   

21:35.160 --> 21:36.793
             You don't know him.
I don't want to.                

21:36.795 --> 21:38.929
     I don't want no white      
     in-laws in my family.      

21:38.931 --> 21:40.563
            They're going to be 
          my in-laws, not yours.

21:40.565 --> 21:42.966
    Think, son, think.          
What about your children?       

21:42.968 --> 21:44.201
     What they going to be?     

21:44.203 --> 21:46.669
  Oh, boys and girls, I hope.   

21:48.439 --> 21:50.740
Louis, we are                   
not wanted here.                

21:50.742 --> 21:52.709
                Helen, don't fly
                 off the handle.

21:52.711 --> 21:55.045
        I want to leave         
         and right now.         

21:55.047 --> 21:56.179
        But, Mom, you--         

21:56.181 --> 21:57.580
Jennie, you stay                
out of this.                    

21:57.582 --> 21:59.049
This is between                 
your father and me.             

21:59.051 --> 22:01.351
          Okay. Okay!           
    Have a good time.           

22:01.353 --> 22:03.186
Can't you tell                  
when you've been insulted?      

22:03.188 --> 22:04.788
                 Now, just don't
                get excited.    

22:04.790 --> 22:08.892
I am not getting excited.       
I am getting mad.               

22:08.894 --> 22:10.193
         Listen to them, Louise.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.062
        That's what happens     
when you mix black and white.   

22:12.064 --> 22:15.098
          Ten more seconds,     
    he's gonna call her, nigger.

22:18.502 --> 22:19.736
              Listen to that.   

22:19.738 --> 22:23.540
              I ain't used      
    that word in three years.   

22:28.313 --> 22:30.547
Louis! I'm getting madder.      

22:30.549 --> 22:32.115
        Listen to this dame     
            over here.          

22:32.117 --> 22:34.318
          Another minute,       
she's gonna call him a honky.   

22:35.553 --> 22:36.820
Hello!                          

22:36.822 --> 22:38.388
         Hi. We brought         
          the records.          

22:38.390 --> 22:39.489
    Did we                      
miss anything?                  

22:39.491 --> 22:41.959
          Only the beginning    
          of World War III.     

22:41.961 --> 22:43.160
        What?                   

22:43.162 --> 22:44.227
                I'll explain    
                  later.        

22:44.229 --> 22:45.462
          Just play something   
            quick, and loud!    

22:45.464 --> 22:46.663
        Oh, okay.               

22:46.665 --> 22:48.198
Louis--                         
              Just take it easy!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.532
             Or they'll think   
          we're really fighting.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.468
Who cares what they think?      

22:51.470 --> 22:53.003
        Ah, come on, now, Helen.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.772
 We've run into his kind before,
         black and white,       

22:55.774 --> 22:57.407
            and we've always    
    been able to handle them.   

22:57.409 --> 23:00.177
Sure, because we never          
let them walk all over us.      

23:00.179 --> 23:01.878
We did something                
about it.                       

23:01.880 --> 23:03.680
              You want me       
    to do something about it?   

23:03.682 --> 23:06.916
        All right, I am going to
          do something about it 

23:06.918 --> 23:08.352
                right now!

              a race riot.

Mrs. Jefferson.                 

23:18.197 --> 23:20.130
              Yes?              

23:20.132 --> 23:22.665
     May I have this dance?     

23:22.667 --> 23:24.301
    You certainly may.          

23:24.303 --> 23:26.069

Sorry, he asked me first.       

23:37.148 --> 23:41.118

No trouble at all.

23:44.323 --> 23:46.856
Mixed dancing!                  

23:46.858 --> 23:50.360
        Mrs. Willis, you have   
             a lovely daughter. 

23:50.362 --> 23:51.395
Thank you.                      

23:51.397 --> 23:52.795
I don't believe                 
we've met.                      

23:52.797 --> 23:54.831
            Oh. I'm Mrs. Bunker.

23:54.833 --> 23:58.335
I ain't one of the relatives.   
      I'm just a good friend.   

24:03.807 --> 24:07.244
              Bunker, what is   
        this world coming to?   

24:07.246 --> 24:08.978
Beats me, Jefferson.            

24:08.980 --> 24:13.683
All I got to say is             
here's to yesterday.            

24:22.393 --> 24:24.627
        Arch, you're wrong.     
         You're dead wrong.     

24:24.629 --> 24:27.330
  Forget it, Michael! There's   
  no sense arguing with Daddy.  

24:27.332 --> 24:29.533
There ain't                     
no sense arguing.               

24:29.535 --> 24:31.301
Because I'm right,              
and I know I'm right.           

24:31.303 --> 24:33.603
All this business               
of mixing the colors,           

24:33.605 --> 24:34.671
      you go on with that,      

24:34.673 --> 24:35.872
the first thing you know,       

24:35.874 --> 24:37.640
    the whole world's           
     going to be one color.     

24:37.642 --> 24:39.876
Well, what's wrong              
with that, Archie?              

24:39.878 --> 24:42.145
    Can't you use your head?    

24:42.147 --> 24:44.314
How the hell are we gonna       
     tell each other apart?     

25:02.567 --> 25:06.436
   <i>["REMEMBERING YOU" PLAYING]</i>  

25:06.438 --> 25:10.407
        ANNOUNCER:

 <i>on tape before a live audience.</i>
