WEBVTT

00:34.293 --> 00:38.089
Chlorine. Bromine. Crap.

00:39.674 --> 00:43.218
Astatine. How could I forget?
It has the words "teen" and "ass" in it.

00:44.386 --> 00:47.389
Steve, you are the worst
Hide and Seek player ever.

00:47.555 --> 00:51.059
I've been banging around in the dryer
for three hours. Feel how soft.

00:51.226 --> 00:54.436
Roger, I told you
I'm not playing with you.

00:54.603 --> 00:58.983
<i>Oh, my God, look what's on Lifetime.
Daphne Zuniga in Spooning with Anger.</i>

00:59.149 --> 01:00.442
- So?
- So?

01:00.609 --> 01:03.320
That's our favorite spousal-abuse movie
of all time.

01:03.487 --> 01:06.364
We gave it higher marks
than Valerie Bertinelli's classic...

01:06.531 --> 01:08.241
<i>...Please, Kevin, Not in the Face.</i>

01:08.408 --> 01:12.036
Leave me alone. I need to bone up
on my halogens for the science club.

01:12.203 --> 01:15.915
Well, you don't mind if I watch it
and turn it up as loud as it goes, do you?

01:16.082 --> 01:18.500
<i>I'm sorry dinner was late.</i>

01:19.835 --> 01:22.379
<i>I love you so much.</i>

01:22.546 --> 01:27.175
Why do they stay, Steve?
Why do they stay?

01:29.010 --> 01:31.637
I can't believe you're still upset.
It's been a week.

01:31.804 --> 01:34.390
- You called me a pig.
- I didn't say you were a pig.

01:34.557 --> 01:37.601
I said that dress
made you look like a pig.

01:37.768 --> 01:39.145
And those shoes didn't help.

01:39.311 --> 01:41.563
All your fat sweaty toes
shoved in there...

01:41.730 --> 01:45.608
...like 20 Hondurans
stuffed in a giant shoe.

01:45.775 --> 01:49.404
- Stop the car. I'm getting out.
- Francine, wait. I'll make it up to you.

01:49.571 --> 01:53.198
Stan, there is nothing you can do
that will ever make me forget this.

01:53.365 --> 01:55.409
Nothing, huh?

01:58.829 --> 02:03.500
Oh, Stan, the Mr. Pibb factory?
You are not playing fair.

02:03.667 --> 02:06.419
- I know.
- I'm not forgiving you.

02:11.007 --> 02:14.093
Mr. Pibb has really seen us
through some times, hasn't he?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.678
That he has. That he has.

02:50.126 --> 02:52.753
Mr. Pibb, the cornerstone of our love.

02:52.920 --> 02:55.714
Delicious, refreshing,
and totally lacking in pretension.

02:55.881 --> 02:57.716
He's not
one of those "doctor" sodas...

02:57.883 --> 03:01.720
...putting on airs and flashing around
his lvy League diploma.

03:01.887 --> 03:03.972
No, Mr. Pibb earns his paycheck.

03:04.139 --> 03:06.599
He's the kind of soda
I'd like to have a beer with.

03:06.766 --> 03:10.019
Welcome to the Mr. Pibb experience.

03:10.186 --> 03:13.606
- Stan? Francine?
- Evening, Bob.

03:13.773 --> 03:16.900
You get the e-mail I sent
with different ideas for Pibb T-shirts?

03:17.067 --> 03:20.862
Yes, I deleted it immediately.

03:21.029 --> 03:22.614
Classic Bob.

03:25.408 --> 03:27.494
Guess what we're doing right now,
this second.

03:27.661 --> 03:31.830
- I'm busy.
- No. We're playing Detective Agency.

03:31.997 --> 03:34.083
I said I've got my science project.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.627
Well, then, at least let me help.

03:36.794 --> 03:38.796
No, don't.

03:40.338 --> 03:42.632
Check it out.
I blinded us with science.

03:42.799 --> 03:46.803
- Roger, you ruined...
- Science. Up high.

03:46.970 --> 03:49.931
I've had it with you, Roger.
Get the hell away from me.

03:50.098 --> 03:54.601
Steve-o, you can't mean that.
I'm your alien.

03:54.768 --> 03:58.146
Yeah, well, I don't want an alien.
It's not cool anymore.

03:58.438 --> 04:03.986
Very well. If you need me, I'll be in the...
Oh, wait. You don't need me.

04:10.074 --> 04:14.412
<i>When I was his alien</i>

04:14.578 --> 04:18.748
<i>And the world was young and gay</i>

04:18.915 --> 04:22.961
<i>He thought I was as interesting</i>

04:23.128 --> 04:27.507
<i>As teddy bears were cute</i>

04:28.674 --> 04:32.469
<i>When I was his alien</i>

04:32.636 --> 04:37.307
<i>Every day was Tanqueray</i>

04:37.474 --> 04:41.561
<i>Every night Bacardi</i>

04:41.728 --> 04:44.856
<i>And the twilight Absolut</i>

04:45.690 --> 04:50.069
<i>Through the winter and the spring</i>

04:50.236 --> 04:54.322
<i>We'd make a game of everything</i>

04:54.489 --> 04:58.326
<i>Chowing down on Dunkaroos</i>

04:58.493 --> 05:01.955
<i>And watching Ricki Lake</i>

05:02.122 --> 05:06.500
<i>But now he's older, breaking free</i>

05:06.667 --> 05:10.713
<i>He'd rather play with boobs than me</i>

05:10.880 --> 05:18.052
<i>I can 't believe
our special bond must break</i>

05:19.929 --> 05:23.308
<i>Now I'm not his alien</i>

05:23.475 --> 05:28.021
<i>What we had must finally end</i>

05:28.188 --> 05:32.441
<i>I'm useless as a car on bricks</i>

05:32.608 --> 05:37.112
<i>Atop a redneck's lawn</i>

05:37.529 --> 05:41.574
<i>Now I'm not his alien</i>

05:41.741 --> 05:47.330
<i>Sadness is my only friend</i>

05:47.997 --> 05:52.375
<i>But life</i>

05:52.542 --> 05:59.841
<i>goes on</i>

06:04.970 --> 06:09.141
Well, that didn't solve anything.
Guess I'll just go out and get hammered.

06:09.308 --> 06:13.938
Flavored syrup is then mixed
with thousands of gallons of water.

06:14.104 --> 06:19.484
Bob, would you say this is where
they put the "Pibb" in "Mr. Pibb"?

06:20.360 --> 06:24.030
- Sure.
- I wonder if there's a real Mr. Pibb.

06:24.197 --> 06:27.867
I'll bet he couldn't handle the celebrity,
so he hid from the public eye.

06:28.034 --> 06:31.161
But every night,
he returns to this very factory...

06:31.328 --> 06:35.249
...to add a dash of magic
to every batch.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.961
Yeah. They're discontinuing Mr. Pibb.

06:39.127 --> 06:40.170
- What?
- What?

06:40.337 --> 06:42.964
The parent company decided
to go a different direction.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.966
This was actually my last tour anyway.

06:45.132 --> 06:47.510
Tomorrow I'm having
a sex-change operation.

06:47.677 --> 06:51.013
From now on,
I'll be living my life as a woman.

06:52.306 --> 06:55.225
Stan, how will we face the future
without Mr. Pibb?

06:55.392 --> 07:00.230
Don't panic. We'll start
a grassroots campaign to save Mr. Pibb.

07:00.397 --> 07:02.774
What if we got a million signatures
on a petition?

07:02.941 --> 07:05.901
The company would have to listen
to us then. Right, Bob?

07:06.819 --> 07:08.779
Oh, soon, my sweets.

07:10.656 --> 07:12.449
I can't wait to get started.

07:12.616 --> 07:16.161
But we're just two consumers.
How can we possibly do this alone?

07:16.328 --> 07:19.372
Oh, Francine, we are not alone.

07:20.039 --> 07:23.209
Behold the Pibbmobile.

07:31.550 --> 07:33.677
Get out. Get out of my bedroom.

07:48.566 --> 07:51.777
Hey, Mom, want to help me
build a birdhouse out of Popsicle sticks?

07:51.944 --> 07:56.031
Mommy's smoking, honey.
Go outside and play in the dark.

08:01.453 --> 08:02.787
Hello?

08:12.212 --> 08:16.216
An alien. My very own alien.

08:22.972 --> 08:24.515
We're gonna be best friends.

08:24.682 --> 08:29.269
Your name is Radblaster.
Can you say "Radblaster"?

08:29.436 --> 08:31.772
It's okay.
I'll teach you how to talk later.

08:32.355 --> 08:34.732
Where the hell am I?

08:34.900 --> 08:37.568
Oh, God. We didn't... you know?

08:37.736 --> 08:40.446
You can talk? But you're an alien.

08:40.613 --> 08:43.282
Alien? Don't be ridiculous.

08:43.448 --> 08:46.619
I'm Bill Cutler,
local midday news anchor.

08:46.786 --> 08:48.829
Oh, crap. Look, kid, I gotta go.

08:48.996 --> 08:51.165
This never happened.
It's all a hallucination.

08:51.332 --> 08:53.958
- You took expired Ritalin.
- Please don't go.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.376
I won't tell anyone.

08:55.543 --> 08:58.421
You're my alien, and I'm gonna
take care of you from now on.

08:58.588 --> 09:00.590
Thanks. I already have a kid
doing that...

09:00.757 --> 09:03.968
...and it's no walk in the...
I can't even get through that thought.

09:04.135 --> 09:07.763
I am hung-to-the-over.
Give me that juice bag.

09:10.682 --> 09:12.935
What is that, guava?

09:13.101 --> 09:15.479
If you were my alien,
I'd play with you all day...

09:15.646 --> 09:17.814
...and never let you out of my sight.

09:17.980 --> 09:21.150
So if we were to play,
say, Hide and Seek...

09:21.317 --> 09:24.195
...you'd actually try to find me?

09:24.362 --> 09:26.531
You're the coolest thing I ever saw.

09:26.697 --> 09:29.324
Do you really have to go
right this second?

09:29.491 --> 09:32.744
Well, I guess I could sit down
and let you make me some breakfast.

09:32.911 --> 09:35.497
Maybe an omelet?
Do you know "omelet" yet?

09:35.664 --> 09:37.874
How old are you? What do you know?

09:39.626 --> 09:41.335
I can't believe we stole a car.

09:41.502 --> 09:44.171
We didn't steal it.
We borrowed it for a higher purpose.

09:44.338 --> 09:46.799
We've got to get the word out
and save Mr. Pibb.

09:46.966 --> 09:51.470
Then I only have one question:
Do you have our tape of hot jams?

09:51.637 --> 09:54.138
I have our hot-jams tape.

10:29.713 --> 10:33.508
Roger. Thank God. Where were you?
You didn't come home last night.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.760
Oh, I was well looked after, Steven.

10:35.927 --> 10:37.262
I found a new boy...

10:37.429 --> 10:41.640
...a boy who won me something
worth 750 tickets at the arcade.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.642
That's more than you make in a year.

10:43.809 --> 10:45.811
Wait. Does this kid know
you're an alien?

10:45.978 --> 10:50.482
Yes, and his heart is filled with wonder
by that fact. Unlike some people.

10:50.649 --> 10:54.110
You know what my dad will do to us
if he finds out your cover was blown?

10:54.277 --> 10:56.195
Relax. Henry won't tell anyone.

10:56.362 --> 10:58.990
Roger, I forbid you
to ever see that kid again.

10:59.157 --> 11:01.284
You can't keep us apart.
You don't know me.

11:01.451 --> 11:03.161
You don't know him.

11:03.327 --> 11:07.372
Hey, have you seen my car mix?
No? Fine!

11:10.125 --> 11:15.088
This is so fun. Steve's too busy
with science and girls to play with me.

11:15.255 --> 11:18.215
I wrote a song about it.
I think it got the point across.

11:20.009 --> 11:22.053
- I got you cornered.
- Oh, yeah?

11:23.971 --> 11:27.683
Whoa, good move. Reese's Piece me.

11:28.225 --> 11:31.478
- You are so cool.
- It's about time someone noticed.

11:31.644 --> 11:35.065
I can also slow-roast a chicken
in my mouth.

11:37.067 --> 11:39.027
- I win.
- Let's have a rematch.

11:39.194 --> 11:42.988
No, let's do something else.
Let's play catch with a Koosh ball.

11:43.155 --> 11:46.033
I said I want a rematch!

11:47.076 --> 11:49.745
You're hurting me. Let go.

11:50.078 --> 11:53.831
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

11:53.998 --> 11:57.126
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you,
but that's what you've done.

11:57.293 --> 11:59.670
Because I am hurting. Very much so.

11:59.837 --> 12:02.548
It's just I hate to lose,
and I don't own a Koosh ball...

12:02.715 --> 12:06.051
...and I thought you wouldn't
wanna hang out with me anymore.

12:07.803 --> 12:10.639
Hey, hey, don't worry.
We all make mistakes.

12:10.806 --> 12:13.141
I took the better part
of a bottle of amaretto...

12:13.308 --> 12:17.061
...and busted a growler
in a museum donation box.

12:17.561 --> 12:19.063
Assembled liberal media...

12:19.230 --> 12:24.401
...as Mr. Pibb, I hereby exercise
my Pibbidential authority to declare war.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.196
On thirst.

12:28.322 --> 12:31.574
<i>Any other drink is little more
than a weapon of mass dehydration.</i>

12:32.951 --> 12:33.993
- Is that...?
- Yes.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.329
The couple always hanging around
the factory.

12:36.496 --> 12:39.332
- Is the Pibbmobile in the lot?
- Yeah, it's still there.

12:39.499 --> 12:43.919
Oh, wait, no, that's a Jetta.
No, the Pibbmobile's gone.

12:44.086 --> 12:48.590
Think, Gordon.
How would Mello Yello handle this?

12:50.133 --> 12:52.261
We're running out of air, lieutenant.

12:52.427 --> 12:54.762
All the other men are dead,
and the sonar's shot.

12:54.929 --> 12:57.515
All is lost. Okay, that was fun.

12:57.682 --> 13:00.518
Where are you going?
We're 40 fathoms under the sea.

13:00.685 --> 13:03.229
- It's getting late.
- It's that Steve, isn't it?

13:03.396 --> 13:06.731
- You're running off to see him.
- Well, I kind of live there.

13:06.898 --> 13:08.942
It's no wonder
he stopped playing with you.

13:09.109 --> 13:10.860
You're so fat and ugly.

13:11.027 --> 13:15.574
- You're as fat as a fart.
- I beg your pardon?

13:15.740 --> 13:19.076
You don't appreciate what I've done
for you. I made you lieutenant.

13:19.243 --> 13:21.370
You were a cook
when we started playing.

13:21.537 --> 13:23.455
Okay, Henry. Take it easy.

13:23.622 --> 13:27.918
This is your fault.
I have to teach you a lesson.

13:29.168 --> 13:31.296
I'm sorry, Henry.

13:36.217 --> 13:39.887
- Home from Henry's already?
- Henry has a full schedule today.

13:40.054 --> 13:41.972
Did you know he's in Sylvan?

13:42.139 --> 13:46.727
His report cards
have improved dramatically.

13:49.271 --> 13:52.441
Oh, my God, your eye. Did he hit you?

13:52.606 --> 13:56.152
It was my fault. I disobeyed captain's
orders and jeopardized the mission.

13:56.319 --> 13:58.195
Stop making excuses for him.

13:58.362 --> 14:01.365
You sound just like Daphne Zuniga
from that Lifetime movie.

14:01.532 --> 14:03.326
And you remember
what happened to her.

14:03.492 --> 14:06.870
Oh, my God.
She ended up on ABC Family.

14:07.037 --> 14:09.873
Well, I'm not gonna
let that happen to me.

14:11.499 --> 14:13.543
- Is Roger here?
- You must be Henry.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.046
Beat it.
Roger never wants to see you again.

14:16.212 --> 14:17.796
Hi, Henry.

14:17.963 --> 14:20.007
Roger, I'm sorry about what happened.

14:20.174 --> 14:23.177
We were playing,
and I didn't eat anything...

14:23.343 --> 14:25.095
...and I'm hypoglycemic.

14:25.888 --> 14:27.848
That explains everything.

14:28.015 --> 14:30.141
- No, it doesn't.
- I'll make it up to you.

14:30.308 --> 14:31.559
I brought my bike.

14:31.726 --> 14:34.062
You can jump in the basket,
and we'll go play.

14:34.228 --> 14:38.775
- Don't do it, Roger.
- You don't understand. He needs me.

14:39.317 --> 14:40.359
Roger.

14:40.525 --> 14:43.195
You come after us,
I'll turn him in to the government...

14:43.361 --> 14:45.280
...and rat out your whole family.

14:45.447 --> 14:49.659
Give it up, buttface.
He's my alien now.

14:51.036 --> 14:54.789
This is one sweet ride.
What is she, a Huffy?

14:55.081 --> 14:58.000
Baby, you treat me so fine.

15:03.172 --> 15:06.382
- What's wrong? You look horrible.
- I've had this flu for two weeks.

15:06.549 --> 15:10.553
I started to feel better on Tuesday, but
I pushed it and now I have this mucus...

15:10.720 --> 15:13.598
- I was talking to Steve.
- Sure you don't want to be a nurse?

15:13.765 --> 15:14.891
You're so caring.

15:15.058 --> 15:16.392
I lost Roger, Hayley.

15:16.558 --> 15:19.228
I was wrapped up in my science fair.
I yelled at him...

15:19.394 --> 15:23.023
...and I drove him right into the arms
of a kid who beats him.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.276
I just thought you got, like, a boner
in gym class or something.

15:26.443 --> 15:29.445
I don't know what to do.
Why does he stay, Hayley?

15:29.612 --> 15:31.072
Why does he stay?

15:31.239 --> 15:34.450
He's getting something from this kid
he wasn't getting from you.

15:34.617 --> 15:36.035
When you have codependency...

15:36.202 --> 15:39.705
...it can be hard to break free
from an abusive relationship.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.748
Can I come out of the pantry now,
babe?

15:41.915 --> 15:44.501
I said I'll get you when I'm ready!

15:45.126 --> 15:48.129
And so I say to you,
graduates of the Naval Academy...

15:48.296 --> 15:50.799
...I know you will all gladly
lay down your lives...

15:50.966 --> 15:55.427
...in the pursuit of signatures to save
Mr. Pibb for generations to come.

15:55.594 --> 15:57.847
Wasn't the speaker
supposed to be Colin Powell?

15:58.013 --> 15:59.473
No, no, no. That's him.

16:00.391 --> 16:03.018
Mr. Smith,
we're from the Mr. Pibb Company.

16:03.185 --> 16:06.396
I'm afraid we cannot allow you
to continue making pronouncements...

16:06.563 --> 16:07.897
...on behalf of our product.

16:08.064 --> 16:11.359
Return the Pibbmobile, and we'll keep
this matter out of the courts.

16:11.526 --> 16:15.196
I see your point.
That sounds perfectly reasonable.

16:15.363 --> 16:16.905
Run!

16:22.286 --> 16:23.620
Hello?

16:23.787 --> 16:26.415
He's gonna kill me!
You were right. Help!

16:26.582 --> 16:29.292
Open this door, damn it!

16:30.251 --> 16:32.253
Hang on. I'm coming.

16:32.920 --> 16:34.463
- Hello?
- Yeah, everything's cool.

16:34.630 --> 16:37.133
Henry and I made up.
He asked me to move in with him.

16:37.300 --> 16:40.428
Oh, for Pete's sake.
I'm coming anyway.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.101
Did you enjoy your Steak-umms,
Henry?

16:48.268 --> 16:52.730
I'll just clean up, then.
I know you like a tidy house.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.861
Steve, you can't be here.
What if he sees you?

16:59.028 --> 17:01.405
- We've gotta get you out of here.
- I would.

17:01.572 --> 17:03.198
If only it weren't for the baby.

17:03.365 --> 17:04.574
Roger, there's no baby.

17:04.741 --> 17:07.492
Oh, guess I didn't need
to give up smoking.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
You don't know
what Henry is capable of.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.332
He'll find me, Steve.
He'll find me and kill me.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.960
- Don't worry. I have a plan.
- Well, it's about time.

17:18.502 --> 17:22.674
The pain.
My moaning stems from pain.

17:22.840 --> 17:26.219
- What's wrong with you?
- I'm dying, Henry.

17:26.386 --> 17:28.846
I need to get back to my home planet.

17:29.013 --> 17:32.183
My alien is dying? Cool.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.770
Yeah, well, anyway, I called my people
and told them to pick me up.

17:35.936 --> 17:38.856
I had to build an interstellar
communication device.

17:44.903 --> 17:48.573
- They found us.
- It's over, Stan. We failed Pibb.

17:48.740 --> 17:50.575
Don't say that.
We'll get through this.

17:50.742 --> 17:52.534
We Pibbs are survivors.

17:52.701 --> 17:55.037
Hello? Anyone home?

17:55.204 --> 17:58.248
You can't treat me like this.
I'm Mr. Pibb.

17:58.415 --> 18:01.460
No, Stan, this is Mr. Pibb.

18:03.003 --> 18:06.214
Mr. Pibb? Is it really you?

18:06.380 --> 18:10.093
Yes, Stan, they brought me
out of the home to talk to you.

18:10.259 --> 18:13.930
First time anyone's come to see me
in a year and a half.

18:14.097 --> 18:16.349
Well, everybody's busy.

18:16.515 --> 18:18.266
This has gone too far.

18:18.433 --> 18:22.062
Now, thirst isn't a war
that can be won or lost.

18:22.229 --> 18:25.816
It's an ongoing dialogue
between man and beverage.

18:25.982 --> 18:28.360
But we've based so much of our love
on your soda.

18:28.526 --> 18:31.570
What are we supposed to drink together
once you're gone?

18:31.737 --> 18:33.364
Try Pibb X tra.

18:33.531 --> 18:36.283
Its bolder taste and graphics
appeal to young adults...

18:36.450 --> 18:38.786
...who are looking
to get the most out of life...

18:38.953 --> 18:41.329
...and the most out of their soft drink.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.748
Sounds off the hook.
But it's not Mr. Pibb.

18:43.915 --> 18:48.294
Soft drinks come and go, Stan.
It's not the brands that matter.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.339
It's having someone
to drink them with.

18:51.506 --> 18:56.343
I didn't fall in love with Mr. Pibb.
I fell in love with you, Francine.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.804
Whatever beverages the future holds...

18:58.971 --> 19:03.809
...as long as we're drinking
them together, we'll be just fine.

19:05.852 --> 19:08.688
So, where's the Pibbmobile?

19:09.105 --> 19:12.775
This is the spot. Where's the ship?

19:14.110 --> 19:16.611
Whoa, they're here.

19:24.661 --> 19:26.663
Oh, man,
he's never gonna fall for this.

19:26.830 --> 19:30.958
- Cool. A real spaceship.
- Then again, he is 9.

19:33.210 --> 19:35.421
Okay, Henry, gotta go.
Thank you. Be good.

19:35.588 --> 19:38.340
I'll be right here. You get the drift.

19:38.841 --> 19:40.259
My lungs.

19:40.550 --> 19:45.054
Wait a minute. You're not dying.
You were planning on ditching me...

19:45.221 --> 19:47.974
...and taking Steve with you
to your home planet.

19:48.141 --> 19:50.685
Okay.

19:51.519 --> 19:55.272
Roger, we better get going if you wanna
meet your parents at Space Cocoa's.

19:55.439 --> 19:58.358
Roger, don't go. I swear I'll change.

19:58.525 --> 20:01.862
We'll play all day,
and we'll make a fort out of pillows.

20:02.029 --> 20:06.365
And I'll never be too busy for you.
You're my alien.

20:07.575 --> 20:11.329
Oh, Henry, yes. Yes.
A thousand times, yes.

20:11.495 --> 20:14.665
No. God, Roger, what the hell?

20:14.832 --> 20:17.459
You're the most backward-ass
advanced life form ever.

20:17.625 --> 20:19.711
See? He doesn't care about you.

20:19.878 --> 20:21.880
I'm not gonna
make a bunch of promises...

20:22.047 --> 20:24.007
...about how
we're gonna play together...

20:24.174 --> 20:26.176
...and how every moment's
gonna be great.

20:26.343 --> 20:28.719
And if a girl calls
and there's a shot at boob...

20:28.886 --> 20:30.304
...I'm going for the boob.

20:30.471 --> 20:32.639
But I will come home
and tell you about it.

20:32.806 --> 20:34.350
Because you're not my alien.

20:35.392 --> 20:38.020
You're my friend, my best friend.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.980
I'm sick of this baloney.

20:41.147 --> 20:43.900
Now get your fat alien ass
in my bike basket!

20:44.067 --> 20:48.905
- No.
- I said, get in the basket.

20:52.866 --> 20:56.244
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

20:56.995 --> 21:00.415
- Ready to go home?
- You bet.

21:06.462 --> 21:08.756
Well, Roger,
it's good to have you back.

21:08.923 --> 21:10.382
Thanks, buddy.

21:10.549 --> 21:14.595
Steve, I think you're cleaning
your glasses with your mom's panties.

21:51.129 --> 21:53.213
