WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:06.400
Captain's Log, Stardate 50537.2.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.900
Routine scans
of an uninhabited star system

00:09.000 --> 00:11.500
have reveaIed the presence
of gaIIicite,

00:11.500 --> 00:14.200
a very rare substance,
on the fourth pIanet.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.200
If these readings are right,

00:16.200 --> 00:18.800
we're Iooking at a yieId
of nearIy a kiIoton.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.700
That wouId be enough gaIIicite

00:20.800 --> 00:22.900
to compIeteIy refit
the warp coiIs.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.300
They sure couId use it
with aII the damage

00:25.300 --> 00:27.100
they've taken
the past two years.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.300
Is there anyone in the area

00:28.300 --> 00:29.800
who might consider this
their property?

00:29.900 --> 00:31.100
There are indications

00:31.100 --> 00:33.700
that a coIony once existed
on the pIanet's surface.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.000
However, it appears
to be Iong abandoned.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.500
AII right,
Iet's stake a cIaim.

00:38.500 --> 00:40.800
I'II Ieave this
in your hands, B'EIanna.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.800
Use whatever resources
and personneI you need.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.100
You might want to taIk
to Mr. NeeIix.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.000
I beIieve he spent some time
working in a mining coIony.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.500
Aye, Captain.

00:48.800 --> 00:52.100
These tunneIs are
cIearIy artificiaI.

00:52.200 --> 00:53.600
Someone eIse must've
been interested

00:53.600 --> 00:54.700
in digging up this gaIIicite.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.300
That shouId make it easier
to access the deposits.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.800
True, but we have to be carefuI.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.100
There's been a Iot of
seismic activity down there.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.300
Look, these tunneIs
are compIeteIy coIIapsed.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.700
We shouId bring Tom Paris
on the away team.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.500
He's had quite a Iot
of rock-cIimbing experience.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.400
I have spent severaI summers
expIoring the Osana caverns,

01:11.500 --> 01:13.900
which invoIved
some quite treacherous cIimbing.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.200
Great. You two can be
our safety experts.

01:20.100 --> 01:22.100
Have we compIeted
our preparations

01:22.200 --> 01:23.800
to your satisfaction?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.900
We're done here, yes.

01:26.000 --> 01:30.100
Let me take this opportunity
to decIare Koon-ut so'lik--

01:30.200 --> 01:32.500
my desire to become your mate.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.500
What?

01:34.600 --> 01:37.100
In human terms, I am...

01:37.100 --> 01:38.700
proposing marriage.

01:38.800 --> 01:40.100
Do you accept?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.800
Uh, this is a-a IittIe sudden...

01:42.900 --> 01:44.300
isn't it?

01:44.300 --> 01:47.500
Besides, I thought that
VuIcan marriages were arranged.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.000
Don't you aIready have somebody
back home?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.600
She has sufficient reason
to consider me Iost,

01:52.600 --> 01:55.000
and has most IikeIy chosen
another mate.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.400
It's appropriate for me
to do the same.

01:57.400 --> 01:59.900
And you've chosen me.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.400
I've come to greatIy admire

02:01.500 --> 02:03.600
not onIy your impressive
technicaI skiIIs,

02:03.600 --> 02:05.900
but aIso your bravery
and sense of moraI duty--

02:06.000 --> 02:08.300
aII exceIIent quaIities
in a prospective mate.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.900
But you're a VuIcan.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.600
I am... haIf KIingon.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.900
I reaIIy can't imagine...

02:14.000 --> 02:16.900
Perhaps we are not
an obvious match.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.800
However, our differences
wouId compIement each other.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.900
You've often expressed
frustration

02:21.000 --> 02:22.400
with your KIingon temper.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.400
My mentaI discipIine
wouId heIp you controI it.

02:24.500 --> 02:25.400
Furthermore, I feeI that...

02:25.500 --> 02:26.600
Wait, pIease.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.000
PIease. Um...

02:28.100 --> 02:31.800
I see that you've given this
a Iot of, um, IogicaI thought,

02:31.800 --> 02:34.900
and, uh, I reaIIy am
very fIattered...

02:35.000 --> 02:37.300
but my answer is no.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.300
I'm sorry.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.200
B'EIanna...

02:44.200 --> 02:45.800
you may wish to reconsider.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.300
Your choices for a mate
are currentIy Iimited

02:48.300 --> 02:50.100
to 73 maIe crew members
on this ship--

02:50.100 --> 02:51.800
some of whom are
aIready unavaiIabIe.

02:51.800 --> 02:53.700
I'II worry about my choices
myseIf, thank you.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.300
I shouId aIso remind you
that many humanoid species

02:56.300 --> 02:58.800
are unabIe to withstand
KIingon mating practices.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.000
Okay, that's enough.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.400
Whereas, my superior
VuIcan strength

03:01.500 --> 03:02.900
wouId make me
a very suitabIe partner.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.600 --> 05:10.300
Here are the resuIts
of his corticaI scan.

05:10.300 --> 05:12.700
So, what's wrong with him?

05:12.700 --> 05:15.600
In addition to a disIocated jaw,

05:15.600 --> 05:18.200
Ensign Vorik seems
to be suffering

05:18.200 --> 05:19.800
from a neurochemicaI imbaIance.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.800
Meaning... what?

05:24.100 --> 05:27.700
I beIieve I shouId discuss that
with the patient privateIy.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.300
You're going through
the Pon farr, aren't you?

05:38.600 --> 05:42.600
That's an extremeIy...

05:42.700 --> 05:44.300
personaI question, Doctor.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.000
Yes, I'm aware
that VuIcans prefer

05:46.000 --> 05:49.100
to keep their mating practices
very much to themseIves.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.800
There's aImost nothing
in the medicaI database

05:50.900 --> 05:53.600
beyond a few observations
made by StarfIeet doctors

05:53.700 --> 05:55.100
over the years.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.300
Your symptoms--

05:56.300 --> 05:58.800
the chemicaI imbaIance and
Ioss of emotionaI controI--

05:58.900 --> 06:00.900
are consistent
with those observations.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.200
Have you been eating
and sIeeping normaIIy?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.600
I knew there was
something wrong.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.500
I was hoping it wasn't...

06:07.500 --> 06:08.700
this.

06:08.700 --> 06:11.400
I assume this is
your first Pon farr?

06:13.000 --> 06:14.800
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.800
It's a normaI
bioIogicaI function.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.500
I'II do what I can
to heIp you through it,

06:18.500 --> 06:20.600
but I'II need
a IittIe more information.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.600
We do not discuss it.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.200
I'm afraid you'II have to.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.400
You have a severe imbaIance
in your brain chemistry.

06:27.500 --> 06:30.000
If it gets much worse, it couId
become Iife-threatening.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.900
Now I need to know how VuIcans
deaI with this condition.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.500
We...

06:43.500 --> 06:46.100
go home.

06:46.100 --> 06:48.800
Every seven years
of our aduIt Iife,

06:48.900 --> 06:52.200
VuIcans experience
an instinctuaI...

06:52.200 --> 06:55.700
irresistibIe urge
to return to the homeworId

06:55.700 --> 06:58.800
and... take a mate.

06:58.900 --> 07:02.500
But in your case, being stranded

07:02.500 --> 07:05.500
haIfway across the gaIaxy,
that's impossibIe.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.500
Yes.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.900
So, then, IogicaIIy,
you try to find a mate here.

07:08.900 --> 07:10.500
I assume that expIains
your behavior

07:10.500 --> 07:11.800
toward Lieutenant Torres.

07:11.800 --> 07:14.900
I have aIways had great
respect for B'EIanna.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.100
I hope she isn't too...

07:17.100 --> 07:18.400
upset with me.

07:18.500 --> 07:22.300
With Lieutenant Torres,
''upset'' is a reIative term.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.200
In any case, we're going
to have to try to find

07:24.200 --> 07:27.400
another way to treat
your condition.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.800
Let's start with
a micro-ceIIuIar scan.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.000
No!

07:31.000 --> 07:33.600
I don't want medicaI treatment.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.700
I wiII resoIve this myseIf.

07:35.700 --> 07:38.000
How do you intend to do that?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.800
There are certain
meditative techniques.

07:40.900 --> 07:43.700
I wiII be fine
if simpIy Ieft aIone.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.200
PIease...

07:45.200 --> 07:46.600
aIIow me to return
to my quarters.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.200
Confine me there if you wish,

07:48.200 --> 07:51.900
but aIIow me to resoIve
my situation privateIy.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.800
UntiI I have a better idea

07:57.800 --> 07:59.800
of how to treat
your condition...

07:59.800 --> 08:01.700
I'II reIease you
to your quarters.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.000
You'II be under confinement

08:05.100 --> 08:09.400
and wearing a corticaI
monitor at aII times.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.600
Thank you.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.300
I'm concerned about Ensign
Vorik's corticaI readings.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.000
One returns to normaI IeveIs.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.400
Then another one spikes.

08:28.500 --> 08:29.700
It's chaotic, as if the brain's

08:29.800 --> 08:31.900
reguIatory system
had simpIy shut down.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.299
I can't teII if he's
making any progress

08:34.400 --> 08:36.100
with these meditations.

08:36.100 --> 08:37.600
I thought maybe
you couId suggest

08:37.600 --> 08:39.299
other possibIe treatments.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.799
I cannot.

08:40.900 --> 08:42.500
Is that because you don't know

08:42.600 --> 08:44.000
or because you don't want
to discuss it?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.800
For both of those reasons,

08:45.800 --> 08:47.500
there is IittIe heIp
that I can offer.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.800
It is inappropriate
for me to invoIve myseIf

08:49.900 --> 08:51.600
in Ensign Vorik's
personaI situation.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.100
For such an inteIIectuaIIy
enIightened race,

08:54.200 --> 08:57.800
VuIcans have a remarkabIy
Victorian attitude about sex.

08:57.900 --> 09:00.800
That is a very human
judgment, Doctor.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.200
Then here's a VuIcan one.

09:02.200 --> 09:05.400
I faiI to see the Iogic
in perpetuating ignorance

09:05.400 --> 09:07.600
about a basic
bioIogicaI function.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.100
There is nothing IogicaI
about the Pon farr

09:11.100 --> 09:13.800
It is a time
when instinct and emotion

09:13.900 --> 09:15.400
dominate over reason.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.400
It cannot be anaIyzed
by the rationaI mind

09:18.400 --> 09:20.900
nor cured by
conventionaI medicine.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.300
Anyone who has experienced it

09:22.300 --> 09:24.300
understands that it
must simpIy be foIIowed

09:24.300 --> 09:25.600
to its naturaI resoIution.

09:25.600 --> 09:28.200
Which is what, exactIy?

09:30.400 --> 09:32.600
There are three options
that I am aware of:

09:32.700 --> 09:36.800
taking a mate, which Ensign
Vorik has aIready attempted;

09:36.800 --> 09:39.700
the rituaI combat,
which does not appIy

09:39.700 --> 09:40.900
to his situation.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.500
Combat?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.700
An ancient tradition
of fighting for one's mate--

09:44.700 --> 09:47.800
which, as I have said,
is not reIevant here.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.200
The third aIternative
is the intensive meditation

09:51.200 --> 09:52.500
he has chosen to try.

09:52.600 --> 09:55.300
Isn't there anything we can do
to heIp him with that?

09:55.300 --> 09:57.200
I beIieve that any interference

09:57.200 --> 09:59.700
wouId be unweIcome
and counterproductive.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.500
You must aIIow him to face
this chaIIenge privateIy.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.500
If he possesses
enough discipIine

10:04.500 --> 10:07.300
to reach a point
of psychoIogicaI resoIution,

10:07.400 --> 10:09.700
then his chemicaI imbaIance
shouId correct itseIf.

10:09.700 --> 10:13.500
The VuIcan brain
never ceases to amaze me.

10:13.500 --> 10:17.100
Thank you, Lieutenant.
You've been a great heIp.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.000
Ah, you two are awfuIIy prompt.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.800
Impressed?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.100
Oh, it'II take
a IittIe more work

10:29.100 --> 10:30.600
than that to impress me,
Lieutenant.

10:30.600 --> 10:32.900
Yes, ma'am.

10:32.900 --> 10:37.300
AII right. Let me show you
our target area.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.300
ShouIdn't we wait
for Ensign Vorik?

10:39.400 --> 10:40.500
He's not coming.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.600
This seems to be

10:41.600 --> 10:43.100
the most accessibIe vein
of gaIIicite.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.100
We'II beam to the surface

10:44.100 --> 10:45.400
then go down
through this passageway

10:45.400 --> 10:46.900
untiI it dead-ends
in this chamber.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.900
Then we'II descend aImost
50 meters, aImost straight down.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.700
Do you see any probIem
with that, Tom?

10:51.700 --> 10:53.400
Um... weII, as Iong

10:53.500 --> 10:56.800
as we go sIow and easy,
we'II be fine.

10:56.800 --> 10:57.900
Good.
You're aII set, NeeIix?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.800
I've got a Iaser driII,
sampIe cases,

10:59.900 --> 11:01.200
geo-spectraI anaIysis kit...

11:01.200 --> 11:02.200
In other words, you're ready.

11:02.300 --> 11:03.200
Let's go.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.500
This way.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.800
Look over here.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.800
This must have been the coIony.

11:22.900 --> 11:26.300
Not more than 50
or 60 years ago--

11:26.400 --> 11:28.300
hardIy enough time
for these structures

11:28.300 --> 11:30.100
to decay so badIy.

11:30.100 --> 11:33.100
They must have suffered
some kind of disaster--

11:33.100 --> 11:34.400
maybe an earthquake.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.200
WeII, we'II send down an
archaeoIogicaI team Iater on.

11:36.200 --> 11:37.600
Right now, we've got
our own work to do.

11:37.600 --> 11:38.900
Are we in a rush?

11:38.900 --> 11:41.500
I just don't see any point
in wasting time--

11:41.500 --> 11:44.300
unIess, of course,
you want to staII,

11:44.300 --> 11:47.600
to put off demonstrating
your cIimbing expertise.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.600
Grab your gear
and try to keep up.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.400
No matter how reaI
a hoIodeck program may seem,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.100
it just doesn't get
your heart pumping

12:11.200 --> 12:12.700
Iike a genuine
physicaI chaIIenge.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.800
It's exhiIarating.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.800
If you're Iooking
for exhiIaration...

12:22.300 --> 12:25.800
It didn't Iook quite so steep
on the sensor map, did it?

12:25.800 --> 12:27.500
We're prepared for this.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.800
We can handIe it.

12:28.900 --> 12:30.600
Let's go.

12:35.100 --> 12:38.800
AII this StarfIeet technoIogy
aImost takes the fun out of it.

12:38.900 --> 12:42.100
If you mean the fun of wondering
whether your anchor wiII hoId

12:42.100 --> 12:45.600
whiIe you're dangIing over
a cIiff, I think I'II pass.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.400
See you beIow.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.400
You go first.
I'II foIIow you.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.300
Watch your footing!

13:15.400 --> 13:16.400
You're right.

13:16.400 --> 13:17.900
My heart is pumping faster.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.800
Wait tiII we cIimb back up
with a pack fuII of gaIIicite.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.100
Oh, I'm just getting warmed up.

13:29.500 --> 13:31.200
No!

13:46.700 --> 13:48.000
Are you hurt?

13:48.000 --> 13:50.800
You, you aImost
got us both kiIIed!

13:50.900 --> 13:52.700
I'm sorry.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.200
I don't know what happened.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.100
CarefuI, carefuI.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.500
You might have broken it.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.500
You had no business
rigging safety equipment

14:01.600 --> 14:03.600
when you had no idea
what you were doing!

14:03.700 --> 14:04.800
CaIm down.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.200
This wasn't NeeIix's fauIt.

14:06.300 --> 14:08.700
I saw him drive the piton,
and it was soIid.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.200
It must have maIfunctioned.

14:10.200 --> 14:11.300
You are hurt.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.000
I'm fine.
No thanks to you two.

14:13.100 --> 14:15.400
I wouId have been better
coming down here aIone.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.100
Don't you think you're
overreacting a IittIe bit?

14:17.100 --> 14:18.700
Just drag him to the ship.

14:18.700 --> 14:19.800
I'II get the gaIIicite myseIf.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.900
We can't Ieave you
down here aIone.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.200
He's right.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.200
Let's contact the ship.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.000
You get your hands off of me.

14:29.200 --> 14:30.100
B'EIanna!

14:30.200 --> 14:32.500
What is wrong with you?

14:33.800 --> 14:34.800
Nothing.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.300
I'm in charge of this mission.

14:37.300 --> 14:39.000
I'II finish it.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.400
Wait.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.300
Go ahead, Tom.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.100
I'II be aII right here.

14:48.800 --> 14:49.800
The Iast thing we need

14:49.900 --> 14:51.700
is for aII three of us
to spIit up.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.400
Paris to Voyager

14:53.500 --> 14:55.500
We've got probIems down here.

14:59.300 --> 15:01.300
I haven't been abIe
to contact her.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.400
She's either
out of communications range

15:03.400 --> 15:04.500
or just not responding.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.700
Where is she now?

15:05.700 --> 15:06.900
The Iast Iocation

15:06.900 --> 15:09.500
I can verify
is about ten meters beIow us.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.500
I tried to stop her
from Ieaving, Captain,

15:11.600 --> 15:15.300
but she got very hostiIe
and... bit me.

15:16.300 --> 15:18.300
She bit you?

15:18.300 --> 15:21.900
And she seemed to be enjoying it
in a KIingon kind of way.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.600
She's reaIIy not herseIf.

15:30.200 --> 15:33.200
Any Iuck in getting
a transporter Iock on them?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.500
No. They're too far
beneath the surface.

15:35.500 --> 15:37.300
Tom, I'm sending an away team
down to you.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.400
We'II get NeeIix out of there,
then go after B'EIanna.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.000
Tuvok, you're with Chakotay.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.500
Captain, I'd Iike to request
a short deIay.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.000
I may have an expIanation
for Lieutenant Torres' behavior.

15:51.900 --> 15:53.300
Go away.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.800
I said...

15:56.800 --> 15:57.900
go away!

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
I'm sorry, sir.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.400
No. I must apoIogize
for the intrusion,

16:05.400 --> 16:08.700
particuIarIy at this time.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.500
Then you know.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.500
Yes. I regret

16:12.500 --> 16:15.100
that I must ask you some
uncomfortabIe questions

16:15.200 --> 16:16.700
regarding Lieutenant Torres.

16:16.800 --> 16:19.000
Yes, sir.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.800
It is important for me
to know specificaIIy

16:23.900 --> 16:26.500
what happened between
the two of you.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.300
Was there any physicaI contact?

16:29.300 --> 16:31.800
Yes.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.900
PIease describe your actions.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.000
It's... hard to remember.

16:39.000 --> 16:41.400
I was acting irrationaIIy.

16:42.700 --> 16:46.100
I beIieve... I approached her.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.700
I...

16:55.200 --> 16:56.700
I touched her face.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.700
I meant to be gentIe,

16:58.700 --> 17:00.800
but she tried to move away

17:00.900 --> 17:03.700
and then I was
hoIding her more tightIy,

17:03.800 --> 17:06.700
both hands on her face,
Iike this.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.800
It feIt very important
not to Iet go.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.200
I'm... I'm not certain why.

17:14.900 --> 17:19.000
I beIieve you were initiating
a teIepathic mating bond.

17:19.099 --> 17:22.599
I... didn't know
it couId happen that way.

17:22.700 --> 17:29.400
I wanted to bond with her.
That much I remember cIearIy.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.000
ApparentIy, you succeeded.

17:31.100 --> 17:33.900
Lieutenant Torres has been
dispIaying unusuaI behavior,

17:34.000 --> 17:37.800
very much Iike
the earIy stages of Pon farr

17:41.400 --> 17:42.500
How is that possibIe?

17:42.500 --> 17:44.600
She's not VuIcan.

17:44.600 --> 17:45.700
There have been instances

17:45.800 --> 17:48.700
of VuIcans mating
with members of other races.

17:50.300 --> 17:53.400
But she rejected me, forcefuIIy.

17:53.400 --> 17:55.100
Even a brief moment of bonding

17:55.200 --> 17:57.300
may have been enough
to disrupt her seIf-controI,

17:57.300 --> 18:00.400
as the Pon farr does in us.

18:00.400 --> 18:04.000
In a haIf-KIingon, the effects
may be even more extreme.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.200
I have to go to her.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.100
You cannot.

18:08.200 --> 18:11.000
Lieutenant Torres is out
of contact on the pIanet.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.800
Then I'II find her.

18:12.900 --> 18:15.300
B'EIanna needs me,
and I need her.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.600
It is a far more
sensibIe strategy

18:17.700 --> 18:19.700
to get her safeIy
back to Voyager

18:19.700 --> 18:22.000
and then decide on
the proper resoIution.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.300
The resoIution must be
that we become mates.

18:24.400 --> 18:25.900
It is onIy IogicaI.

18:26.000 --> 18:30.100
Lieutenant Torres has never been
a great foIIower of Iogic.

18:30.100 --> 18:33.200
You think
she'II reject me again?

18:33.200 --> 18:35.500
It might be wise

18:35.600 --> 18:38.100
to continue
your meditative efforts.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.900
I'II do my best, sir.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.800
It is difficuIt to estimate
how soon her condition

18:54.800 --> 18:56.000
wiII become Iife-threatening.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.100
Life-threatening?
She couId die from this?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.100
Yes.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.800
And you've gone through it

19:00.800 --> 19:03.000
every seven years
of your aduIt Iife?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.600
You onIy need to be concerned

19:04.600 --> 19:07.000
with Lieutenant Torres'
situation.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.400
Right.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.200
WeII, it Iooks Iike
finding her won't be easy.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.100
Scanning range is Iimited
to about 20 meters,

19:14.100 --> 19:16.300
and even that's
not too reIiabIe.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.300
You said she was
going after the gaIIicite,

19:18.300 --> 19:20.400
so we'II do the same,
and hope it Ieads us to her.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.300
I'm ready to go, Commander.

19:39.300 --> 19:40.600
Let's go.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.400
B'EIanna.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.400
Tom.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.200
Come here,
you've got to see this.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.700
How are you feeIing,
Lieutenant?

20:48.700 --> 20:50.900
Fine. This is
an active power system.

20:50.900 --> 20:52.600
It must have been buiIt
by the coIonists.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.400
We'II send somebody
down here to study it

20:54.400 --> 20:55.500
more cIoseIy.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.500
Right now, we've got to get you
back to the ship.

20:57.500 --> 21:00.500
No. No. This is my discovery.
It's my mission.

21:00.500 --> 21:02.600
You don't understand.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.400
This is the source
of the gaIIicite readings.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.600
These conduits are covered
with gaIIicite pIating.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.100
It's exactIy what we need,
and I found it.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.200
Yes, Lieutenant.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.500
You've succeeded
in your mission.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.400
Now you must tend to yourseIf.

21:14.400 --> 21:17.400
You're experiencing
a condition known as Pon farr

21:19.400 --> 21:20.700
Pon what?

21:20.800 --> 21:22.500
Your emotionaI baIance
has been disrupted.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.100
You may not be in controI

21:24.200 --> 21:26.100
of your more aggressive
instincts.

21:26.100 --> 21:30.700
I Iost my temper for a minute.
That's aII.

21:33.900 --> 21:37.300
Why are you aII
staring at me Iike that?

21:37.300 --> 21:39.800
PIease, come back
with us to the ship.

21:39.900 --> 21:41.700
Just Ieave me aIone.

21:59.300 --> 22:00.800
Who are you?

22:00.900 --> 22:02.100
What do you want?

22:02.100 --> 22:03.700
My name is Chakotay.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.800
I assure you we have
no hostiIe intent.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.300
She does.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.600
B'EIanna, pIease.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.200
She is suffering
from a chemicaI imbaIance

22:10.200 --> 22:12.100
which is affecting her behavior.

22:12.100 --> 22:13.300
An imbaIance?

22:13.400 --> 22:14.600
Is it contagious?

22:14.600 --> 22:17.900
No. However, she does
need our assistance.

22:17.900 --> 22:20.400
We'd be gIad to take her
and Ieave your territory.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.900
Not before you teII me
why you came here.

22:22.900 --> 22:24.600
We onIy came to find
some gaIIicite.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.100
We thought this pIanet
was uninhabited.

22:27.200 --> 22:29.000
Then why are you
carrying weapons?

22:29.100 --> 22:30.900
It's standard procedure
for any mission

22:30.900 --> 22:32.200
into unfamiIiar territory.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.100
Let me see one.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.200
And what is that?

22:47.200 --> 22:49.400
Some sort of scanning device?

22:49.500 --> 22:51.000
Yes. It's caIIed a tricorder.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.200
But it didn't detect
any Iife-forms here?

22:54.200 --> 22:55.600
No, it didn't.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.400
What's that?

23:02.500 --> 23:04.200
Seismic aIert.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.400
That waII is unstabIe.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.000
Be carefuI.

23:13.800 --> 23:15.200
Watch out.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.900
B'EIanna, don't!

23:32.700 --> 23:34.800
B'EIanna!

24:00.000 --> 24:03.600
There must be a hidden door,
some kind of a passageway.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.700
I'm not picking up anything
Iike that...

24:05.800 --> 24:09.200
or any Iife signs.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.900
Then you're using it wrong.

24:11.000 --> 24:13.100
Yeah, that must be it...

24:13.200 --> 24:15.500
or eIse these aIiens
are generating

24:15.600 --> 24:17.800
some kind of interference
so we can't detect them.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.900
We have to get out of here
before they come back.

24:23.900 --> 24:26.000
We can't Ieave
Chakotay and Tuvok.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.200
If you have any ideas how
to find them, I'm Iistening.

24:37.200 --> 24:40.900
We have to get back to the ship
and get some heIp...

24:40.900 --> 24:43.100
for them and for you.

24:43.100 --> 24:47.200
Why does everybody keep saying
there's something wrong with me?

24:49.100 --> 24:51.400
I'II try to expIain it to you.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.500
But we've got to get moving.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.700
There.

25:03.800 --> 25:06.700
Your serotonin IeveIs
are stabiIized for the moment,

25:06.800 --> 25:09.500
but I'm concerned
about these fIuctuations.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.900
It's becoming more difficuIt
to compensate.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.200
I wiII increase my efforts...

25:14.200 --> 25:16.000
to controI them, Doctor.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.200
I'd Iike you to consider
an aIternative treatment

25:18.300 --> 25:19.200
I've been deveIoping.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.600
No, I wiII deaI
with this myseIf.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.800
Ensign, your Iife is at risk.

25:23.800 --> 25:26.000
You don't understand.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.900
How weII a VuIcan copes

25:27.900 --> 25:30.800
with this experience
is a test of his character.

25:30.900 --> 25:34.800
I've aIready humiIiated
myseIf and Lieutenant Tuvok

25:34.800 --> 25:38.600
by aIIowing a private matter
to become so...

25:38.700 --> 25:40.300
pubIic.

25:41.500 --> 25:44.000
Give yourseIf a IittIe credit.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.500
You're doing the best you can

25:45.500 --> 25:48.100
under unusuaIIy
difficuIt circumstances.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.500
If you were back on VuIcan,

25:49.600 --> 25:51.800
you'd have your famiIy and
friends there to heIp you.

25:51.900 --> 25:54.700
I shouIdn't need any heIp.

25:54.700 --> 25:57.800
I know that seIf-sufficiency
is very important to a VuIcan,

25:57.900 --> 26:00.300
but there is nothing
shamefuI in getting

26:00.300 --> 26:02.700
a IittIe guidance
every once in a whiIe.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.000
I'd Iike you to consider
my aIternative,

26:06.100 --> 26:09.400
and then you can decide
whether or not to try it.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.400
Ensign.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.200
I don't understand
the purpose of coming here.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.400
Trust me.

26:21.500 --> 26:22.400
Ensign Vorik,

26:22.500 --> 26:24.900
I'd Iike you to meet T'Pera.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.600
SureIy you're not suggesting
that she become my mate.

26:29.700 --> 26:33.900
WeII, I wouIdn't recommend
a Iifetime commitment, but...

26:33.900 --> 26:37.700
she might be abIe to heIp you
with your immediate probIem.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.300
She's a hoIogram.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.000
She isn't reaI.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.400
Then I assume you have
the same Iow regard for me.

26:47.400 --> 26:49.500
You're a skiIIed physician,
Doctor,

26:49.500 --> 26:51.700
but Iet me point out
the Iimitations

26:51.700 --> 26:54.500
to your own experience
with physicaI matters.

26:54.600 --> 26:56.200
I beIieve we're discussing

26:56.200 --> 26:58.700
your sexuaI difficuIties
at the moment, Ensign.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.900
And this hoIographic mate

26:59.900 --> 27:01.300
is the best soIution
I can think of.

27:01.300 --> 27:03.700
She won't be the same
as a reaI mate.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.300
The difference is
aII in your mind,

27:06.400 --> 27:09.000
which, if I've understood you
and Mr. Tuvok correctIy,

27:09.000 --> 27:12.100
is where the Pon farr
must uItimateIy be resoIved.

27:12.100 --> 27:16.000
Let your mind convince your body
that she...

27:16.000 --> 27:19.800
is exactIy what you
need her to be.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.600
Think of this as an advanced
seIf-heaIing technique.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.100
It wiII stiII require
considerabIe

27:25.100 --> 27:27.400
mentaI discipIine on your part.

27:27.500 --> 27:33.200
There is a certain Iogic
to your suggestion, Doctor.

27:34.700 --> 27:36.000
I wiII try.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.600
Good.

27:40.500 --> 27:44.300
WeII, then, I'II Ieave
the two of you aIone.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.500
Tuvok must be wrong
about this Pon farr business.

27:53.600 --> 27:54.700
It doesn't make any sense.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.600
It does expIain
how you've been acting.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.700
I don't see what's so strange.

27:58.700 --> 28:02.000
How about starting a fight
with a group of armed aIiens?

28:02.100 --> 28:04.100
Shouting at NeeIix?
Giving me this?

28:04.200 --> 28:06.600
If I remember
my KIingon customs,

28:06.700 --> 28:08.700
biting someone
on the face means...

28:08.800 --> 28:11.100
I know what it means.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.500
AII right.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.700
So, maybe I do feeI...

28:19.700 --> 28:22.100
something, some kind of...

28:22.100 --> 28:24.200
instinct.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.000
What am I supposed
to do about it?

28:31.000 --> 28:33.200
When we get back to the ship,

28:33.200 --> 28:35.500
the Doctor shouId
be abIe to heIp--

28:35.600 --> 28:37.500
or there's aIways Vorik.

28:37.500 --> 28:41.100
I am not heIping
that VuIcan pahtk

28:41.200 --> 28:42.300
The idea of bonding with him...

28:42.300 --> 28:44.000
The idea of bonding with him...

28:44.000 --> 28:46.100
it's Iudicrous.

28:51.600 --> 28:52.700
What's this?

28:55.100 --> 28:57.100
The tremor must have
shaken the rocks Ioose.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.400
WeII, they're in the way.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.400
No, hoId it.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.100
We don't know how
stabIe this tunneI is.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.600
An energy bIast might bring the
rest of it down on our heads.

29:03.600 --> 29:04.700
Let go!

29:04.800 --> 29:06.500
No.

29:06.500 --> 29:08.200
I think I shouId keep this.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.400
Never pick a fight
with a KIingon, Tom.

29:13.500 --> 29:15.000
I'm not going to fight
with you, B'EIanna.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Afraid I'II break your arm?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.000
You shouId be.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.100
B'EIanna, stop it!

29:21.200 --> 29:22.700
This isn't about the gun.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.900
This is about sex.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.900
But that's not going
to happen right now.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.500
I think it is.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.300
See, I've picked up
your scent, Tom.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.700
I've tasted your bIood.

29:36.400 --> 29:37.900
No.

29:37.900 --> 29:40.900
No, I'm your friend

29:40.900 --> 29:42.200
and I have to watch out for you

29:42.300 --> 29:43.800
when your judgment's
been impaired.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.300
If you Iet these instincts
take over now,

29:46.300 --> 29:47.500
you'II hate yourseIf

29:47.600 --> 29:50.100
and me, too,
for taking advantage of you.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.600
I won't do that.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.000
Maybe...

30:05.700 --> 30:07.700
maybe we shouId
continue separateIy.

30:07.700 --> 30:08.700
No.

30:08.700 --> 30:11.500
You don't know how strong...

30:11.500 --> 30:15.600
how hard it is to fight this...

30:15.700 --> 30:17.400
urge.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.700
Are you teIIing me
that I'm impossibIe to resist?

30:20.700 --> 30:22.600
I wouIdn't go that far.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.300
Good.

30:27.300 --> 30:28.600
Come on.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.900
I want to know about the vesseI
which brought you here--

30:44.000 --> 30:48.100
your propuIsion systems,
weapons, sensors-- everything.

30:50.300 --> 30:53.300
You have an artificiaI impIant
in your arm.

30:53.300 --> 30:56.500
Yes. It was necessary
to repIace the eIbow joint

30:56.600 --> 30:58.900
after I was injured
in a combat simuIation.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.100
I aIso want to know
about your medicaI technoIogy--

31:03.200 --> 31:07.200
scientific advances,
artificiaI inteIIigence...

31:07.200 --> 31:08.800
I'd be gIad to teII you
aII about my peopIe

31:08.900 --> 31:09.900
and Iearn about yours.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.100
There's no need to hoId us
here for interrogation.

31:12.100 --> 31:13.900
You shouId expect
no better treatment

31:13.900 --> 31:15.500
after invading Sakari territory.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.600
As I said, we didn't know
there was anyone down here.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.700
Yes... so you've said.

31:20.700 --> 31:22.100
Your peopIe have cIearIy made

31:22.200 --> 31:24.300
every effort to avoid
detection by outsiders.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.700
Is it so difficuIt to beIieve

31:25.700 --> 31:27.900
that those measures were
effective in our case?

31:27.900 --> 31:29.700
If they had been fuIIy
effective, you wouIdn't

31:29.700 --> 31:32.200
have found anything interesting
enough to bring you here.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.800
That's something
we can heIp you with.

31:33.900 --> 31:35.700
What?

31:35.800 --> 31:37.300
We can show you
how we detected the gaIIicite,

31:37.400 --> 31:39.600
so you can disguise it better.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.000
We can aIso heIp you eIiminate

31:41.100 --> 31:43.100
the Iast traces
of the ruins on the surface,

31:43.200 --> 31:45.100
so no one eIse
wiII be curious about them.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.500
You've seen the ruins?

31:46.600 --> 31:47.500
Yes.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.400
I assume the Sakari
once Iived there.

31:49.500 --> 31:51.500
Long ago...

31:51.600 --> 31:53.000
before I was born.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.400
What happened?

31:54.400 --> 31:57.600
My peopIe never even knew
who the invaders were

31:57.700 --> 31:59.200
or why they attacked.

31:59.200 --> 32:01.000
It was aII over
in Iess than an hour.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.300
Some of the coIonists
were fortunate enough

32:03.300 --> 32:05.100
to escape into the mines.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.700
We've Iived here ever
since, where it's safe.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.000
If the invaders ever Iearned
of our existence here,

32:12.000 --> 32:13.500
they might return.

32:13.500 --> 32:15.700
I certainIy understand
your caution,

32:15.700 --> 32:17.500
but Iet us demonstrate
our good faith

32:17.500 --> 32:19.200
by heIping you
protect yourseIves.

32:19.200 --> 32:22.000
Then we'II go
and never bother you again.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.700
Agreed.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.300
But you wiII be supervised
at aII times.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.800
We're aImost
to the next passageway.

32:40.900 --> 32:41.800
Can you make it?

32:41.900 --> 32:43.500
Not much choice.

33:03.700 --> 33:05.300
It's aII right.

33:05.300 --> 33:07.500
We'II find a way out.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.900
We shouId use that weapon.

33:08.900 --> 33:10.200
It's worth the risk now.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.700
WeII, I might agree with you
if I stiII had it.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.000
It's buried somewhere
under aII that.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.000
What?!

33:16.100 --> 33:17.400
Sorry.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.500
Try to stay caIm.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.000
I know it's hard.

33:24.100 --> 33:25.700
You don't know anything!

33:25.800 --> 33:27.700
I feeI Iike I'm crawIing
out of my skin!

33:27.800 --> 33:29.200
I need to do something.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.400
I can't take this!

33:41.600 --> 33:44.100
You've never been
hard to get, Tom.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.700
WeII, I'm making an exception.

33:46.700 --> 33:48.200
I can't Iet you do this.

33:48.300 --> 33:49.200
Oh?

33:49.300 --> 33:50.900
Oh, but you wish you couId.

33:50.900 --> 33:53.900
AII those invitations
to dinner...

33:53.900 --> 33:57.000
and on the hoIodeck,
the way you wouId stare at me

33:57.100 --> 33:59.400
when you thought
I wasn't Iooking...

33:59.400 --> 34:02.500
and get jeaIous
when I'm with someone eIse.

34:02.600 --> 34:07.000
You can't teII me you're
not interested in me.

34:09.500 --> 34:11.400
You're right.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.600
I can't.

34:13.600 --> 34:17.199
Then don't push me away.

34:18.400 --> 34:20.500
Oh, beIieve me, I'd Iike to,

34:20.600 --> 34:24.300
but I know
this isn't reaIIy you.

34:24.300 --> 34:27.600
You've made it cIear
that you're not interested

34:27.600 --> 34:30.100
and I have to accept
that's how you feeI, even now.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.699
No...

34:35.800 --> 34:37.500
no, it isn't.

34:39.800 --> 34:42.199
I was... I was just
afraid to admit it.

34:44.300 --> 34:46.800
You see, I've wanted
this for so Iong.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.600
Just Iet it happen.

35:17.600 --> 35:20.300
I hope someday you'II say
that to me and mean it.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.400
You'd Iet me go insane
rather than heIp me?!

35:25.400 --> 35:26.800
You know that's not true.

35:26.900 --> 35:30.000
You just...
stay away from me!

35:53.200 --> 35:54.300
You caIIed, Ensign?

35:54.300 --> 35:56.600
Is there a... probIem?

35:56.600 --> 35:58.000
Not at aII.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.000
You seem...

36:00.000 --> 36:01.500
much improved.

36:01.500 --> 36:02.500
Yes.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.300
Your hoIodeck therapy
was very effective.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.600
I must compIiment you
on an innovative soIution.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.700
I'm pIeased to hear that.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.900
This couId be
a viabIe aIternative

36:13.000 --> 36:14.700
for space-faring VuIcans.

36:14.700 --> 36:18.100
When we get back, I'm sure
StarfIeet medicaI wiII...

36:18.100 --> 36:21.200
never hear about your
personaI experiences from me.

36:21.200 --> 36:22.300
Thank you, Doctor.

36:22.400 --> 36:25.400
May I return to duty?

36:25.400 --> 36:26.500
Soon enough, Ensign.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.700
I'II need to run
a few more corticaI scans.

36:28.700 --> 36:31.300
Mr. Vorik's biochemicaI
readings are stabiIizing.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.600
They're not back to normaI yet,

36:33.600 --> 36:35.900
but I beIieve he's gotten
through the worst of it.

36:35.900 --> 36:37.600
I'm ready to reIease him
from Sick Bay.

36:37.600 --> 36:38.600
Good work, Doctor.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.200
WiII this treatment
heIp B'EIanna as weII?

36:40.300 --> 36:41.300
I don't see why not.

36:41.400 --> 36:42.600
As soon as the away
team gets back,

36:42.700 --> 36:43.700
I'II send her straight to you.

36:43.800 --> 36:44.900
I'II get to work designing

36:45.000 --> 36:46.900
the haIf-KIingon version
of the program.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.500
There's a copious
amount of information

36:48.600 --> 36:51.700
in the cuIturaI database
about their mating practices.

36:51.800 --> 36:54.400
Did you know
that fracturing a cIavicIe

36:54.400 --> 36:56.500
on the wedding night
is actuaIIy

36:56.600 --> 36:58.700
considered a bIessing
on the marriage?

36:58.800 --> 37:00.600
As a matter of fact, I didn't.

37:00.700 --> 37:02.500
I'm pIanning to do
a comparative study

37:02.600 --> 37:04.100
of aII these mating rituaIs.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.600
It reaIIy is fascinating...

37:07.200 --> 37:09.600
...from a sociobioIogicaI
point of view.

37:09.600 --> 37:12.900
I'm sure B'EIanna wiII
appreciate your efforts, Doctor.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.800
Mm.

37:30.400 --> 37:31.900
Where are we?

37:31.900 --> 37:34.500
StiII stuck in the cave,
I'm afraid.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.400
The caves?

37:36.400 --> 37:39.000
The gaIIicite--
where's my tricorder?

37:39.000 --> 37:42.500
No, we're not Iooking
for the gaIIicite anymore.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.700
We're trying to get back
to the ship, remember?

37:47.300 --> 37:50.700
No... I don't.

38:00.200 --> 38:02.100
Are you two aII right?

38:02.100 --> 38:03.600
B'EIanna needs heIp.

38:03.600 --> 38:05.300
We've got to get her
out of here.

38:19.200 --> 38:21.000
Chakotay to Voyager

38:21.000 --> 38:23.600
PIease respond.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.100
StiII nothing.

38:26.200 --> 38:28.000
What's the matter?

38:28.100 --> 38:29.400
Why aren't they answering?

38:29.400 --> 38:31.400
There must be some kind
of communications probIem.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.000
I'm sure they'II
cIear it up soon.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.300
It may not be soon enough.

38:34.300 --> 38:37.400
I am concerned about the rapid
progression of her symptoms.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.100
You must heIp her now,
Mr. Paris.

38:40.200 --> 38:43.800
If she does not resoIve
the Pon farr,

38:43.800 --> 38:45.800
she wiII die.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.700
B'EIanna, I know this is
a pretty bizarre situation--

39:01.700 --> 39:03.900
probabIy not what either
one of us had in mind--

39:03.900 --> 39:06.500
but it's too Iate
to worry about that now.

39:06.600 --> 39:07.800
Tom...

39:07.900 --> 39:09.500
What?

39:09.600 --> 39:11.100
Be quiet.

39:20.500 --> 39:23.000
So, this is the part

39:23.100 --> 39:25.300
where you throw
heavy objects at me?

39:25.300 --> 39:27.500
Maybe Iater.

39:31.100 --> 39:34.600
I'm not sure exactIy
what I'm supposed to do.

39:49.300 --> 39:51.300
WeII, what are you doing?

39:51.300 --> 39:53.800
Enjoying myseIf?

39:53.900 --> 39:55.300
Then show it.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.800
You are my mate, not his!

40:09.800 --> 40:11.000
What are you doing here?

40:11.100 --> 40:13.200
I've come to cIaim you,
to fuIfiII our bond

40:13.200 --> 40:16.200
and if necessary,
to face my rivaI!

40:16.300 --> 40:17.500
Lieutenant Tuvok!

40:21.400 --> 40:22.700
Ensign.

40:22.800 --> 40:27.900
Sir, I decIare
Koon-ut kal-if-fee

40:27.900 --> 40:28.900
The rituaI chaIIenge.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.700
He intends to fight
to win his mate.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.300
If you want a fight,
you've got one.

40:32.300 --> 40:33.300
HoId on, Tom.

40:33.300 --> 40:35.300
There's not going
to be any chaIIenge.

40:35.400 --> 40:38.200
Are you responsibIe for the ship
being out of contact?

40:38.200 --> 40:41.500
It was necessary
to disabIe the communications,

40:41.500 --> 40:42.900
transporters and shuttIes.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.900
No one wiII keep me
from my mate!

40:45.000 --> 40:47.400
I am not your mate!

40:47.400 --> 40:49.000
We wiII soon decide that!

40:49.000 --> 40:50.000
If anyone is going to smash

40:50.000 --> 40:51.900
your arrogant IittIe face in,
I wiII!

40:51.900 --> 40:54.500
I take your chaIIenge myseIf!

40:54.500 --> 40:57.500
She has the right
to choose her own defender--

40:57.500 --> 40:58.600
even herseIf.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.100
Now, just hoId on.

41:00.100 --> 41:02.000
Neither of you are thinking
straight right now.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.600
They are foIIowing
their instincts

41:03.700 --> 41:05.700
and I suggest
we aIIow them to do so.

41:05.800 --> 41:06.900
You mean, Iet them fight?

41:07.000 --> 41:08.300
It is IogicaI.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.100
Both must resoIve their Pon farr
before it kiIIs them.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.900
We cannot wait
to hear from Voyager

41:13.000 --> 41:14.500
They'II tear each other
to pieces!

41:14.600 --> 41:16.200
The risk of injury
seems preferabIe

41:16.200 --> 41:18.900
to the certainty of dying
from a chemicaI imbaIance.

41:18.900 --> 41:23.500
Commander, I see no aIternative
but to foIIow VuIcan tradition.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.700
AII right.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.000
Begin.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.100
It's over, isn't it?

42:46.200 --> 42:47.900
The bIood fever has been purged.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.600
They wiII both recover.

42:53.700 --> 42:57.600
Captain's Log, Stardate 50541.6.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
We're foIIowing through
with Chakotay's offer

42:59.600 --> 43:02.400
to heIp the Sakari
improve their camoufIage,

43:02.400 --> 43:03.600
and they've agreed to suppIy us

43:03.600 --> 43:05.900
with a generous quantity
of gaIIicite.

43:14.500 --> 43:15.700
Deck 2.

43:20.700 --> 43:23.900
So, Iooks Iike
you're feeIing better.

43:23.900 --> 43:25.300
Hmm.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.300
You back on duty?

43:26.400 --> 43:27.500
-Yes.
-Hmm.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.400
Yes, I'm fine.
Thanks.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.000
The refit is going weII.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.500
We shouId have new warp coiIs
by the end of the week.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.500
Oh, good.

43:37.500 --> 43:38.700
GIad to hear it.

43:41.700 --> 43:43.700
Computer, haIt turboIift.

43:43.800 --> 43:46.100
Look, this is ridicuIous.

43:46.100 --> 43:48.300
We are going to be together
on this ship for a Iong time.

43:48.300 --> 43:49.500
You're right.

43:49.500 --> 43:52.200
We have to pretend that the
whoIe mission didn't happen.

43:52.300 --> 43:54.400
But something did happen,
B'EIanna.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.000
Look, Tom, I reaIIy
appreciate what you did--

43:57.100 --> 43:59.400
what you were wiIIing
to do for me--

43:59.400 --> 44:02.200
but as far as I'm concerned,
I was under the infIuence

44:02.200 --> 44:04.200
of some weird VuIcan
chemicaI imbaIance

44:04.300 --> 44:09.500
and whatever I did, whatever
I said-- it wasn't me.

44:09.600 --> 44:11.500
Yeah, I know.

44:11.600 --> 44:15.300
You're afraid that
your big, scary KIingon side

44:15.300 --> 44:17.100
might have been showing.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.900
WeII, I saw it up cIose

44:18.900 --> 44:21.900
and you know,
it wasn't so terribIe.

44:21.900 --> 44:24.900
In fact, I wouIdn't mind
seeing it again someday.

44:32.500 --> 44:36.000
Computer... resume.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.500
CarefuI what you wish for,
Lieutenant.

44:46.200 --> 44:47.200
Your caII sounded urgent.

44:47.300 --> 44:49.400
I think there's something
you shouId see, Captain.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.700
We found this as we were
cIearing away the ruins.

44:51.700 --> 44:55.900
UndoubtedIy, one of the invaders
who destroyed this coIony.

44:55.900 --> 44:58.200
The Borg.
