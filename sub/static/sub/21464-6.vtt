WEBVTT

02:04.667 --> 02:06.836
- Hey, Fred.
- Hey, how are you?

02:13.801 --> 02:14.884
Hey!

02:14.885 --> 02:15.803
Hey, Ted.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.284
Hey, Theresa.

02:39.285 --> 02:41.620
Oh. Oh, my gosh. Ted.
I am so glad you're here.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.913
You know, would you mind
helping me a tiny bit today?

02:43.914 --> 02:46.082
It's going to be so crazy.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.542
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey. Good morning.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.127
Oh, great.
You brought the extras.

02:49.128 --> 02:50.296
Could you just pick these up?

02:52.882 --> 02:53.924
What's the big event?

03:08.230 --> 03:09.898
I read the whole thing.
I couldn't wait.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.567
I read it this morning
on the FBI's Internet web page.

03:12.568 --> 03:16.697
He's obviously very well-educated,
very intelligent man.

03:17.573 --> 03:19.200
A lot of what he says
makes sense to me.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.452
Sympathizing
with a serial bomber, now?

03:22.453 --> 03:23.912
Be careful.

03:23.913 --> 03:25.872
The FBI might come by
asking questions.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.833
We had to order
a ton of extra copies.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.711
There's actually a wait list for it.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.671
- For what?
- For the manifesto.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.049
You have to sign up.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.676
Well, they explained it in <i>The Times.</i>

03:38.677 --> 03:41.930
I guess he was choosing
representational targets,

03:41.931 --> 03:43.640
so, like, all the stuff he talks about,

03:43.641 --> 03:45.808
the environment, computers,
cloning, all that.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.686
He was sending bombs to people
who represented

03:48.687 --> 03:50.772
what he was fighting against.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.816
Robert Wright, "There's a little bit
of the Unabomber in most of us.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.985
"We may not share his approach
to airing a grievance,

03:55.986 --> 03:58.072
but the grievance itself
feels familiar."

03:58.614 --> 04:01.032
And then, here, look.
Robert Sale in <i>The Times.</i>

04:01.033 --> 04:03.243
"The manifesto's first sentence
is absolutely crucial

04:03.244 --> 04:04.869
"for the American public to understand

04:04.870 --> 04:07.580
and ought to be on the forefront
of the nation's political agenda."

04:07.581 --> 04:10.166
I forgot what the first
sentence was, but...

04:10.167 --> 04:13.294
"The Industrial Revolution
and its consequences

04:13.295 --> 04:15.798
have been a disaster
for the human race."

04:16.715 --> 04:17.799
See?

04:17.800 --> 04:19.050
See? You act like I'm crazy,

04:19.051 --> 04:21.136
but it's kind of true, right?

04:29.687 --> 04:31.271
Thank you.

04:31.272 --> 04:32.605
If you're here
for <i>The Washington Post,</i>

04:32.606 --> 04:34.524
you have to be on the list.
Did you sign up?

04:34.525 --> 04:35.526
No, not yet.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.499
<i>Dear David,</i>

04:52.626 --> 04:54.210
<i>I'll begin by saying</i>

04:54.211 --> 04:56.671
<i>this letter is not to be
construed as an apology,</i>

04:56.672 --> 04:59.550
<i>and my feelings about Linda
have not changed.</i>

05:00.426 --> 05:01.635
<i>However,</i>

05:02.928 --> 05:05.847
<i>I find myself at a strange
crossroads in my life,</i>

05:05.848 --> 05:09.267
<i>and I'm in need
of some fraternal advice.</i>

05:09.268 --> 05:12.895
<i>A certain activity which has
been very time-consuming</i>

05:12.896 --> 05:15.440
<i>for nearly the entirety
of my adult life</i>

05:15.441 --> 05:19.737
<i>now seems to have become
no longer necessary.</i>

05:20.237 --> 05:22.948
<i>Forgive me if I say no more than that.</i>

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
Hey, Ted.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.001
<i>David, you know
I've always had trouble</i>

05:35.002 --> 05:37.295
<i>connecting with people.</i>

05:37.296 --> 05:40.048
<i>I just can't tell
what they're feeling,</i>

05:40.049 --> 05:42.925
<i>what they're really
thinking about.</i>

05:42.926 --> 05:44.219
Come here.
How was school?

05:45.512 --> 05:48.014
Oh, did you talk to Miss Noble
about Saturday?

05:48.015 --> 05:49.974
Yeah, I did.
She said it was fine.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.436
<i>My whole life, I've felt like
I'm watching the world</i>

05:53.437 --> 05:56.147
<i>from the other side of a window,</i>

05:56.148 --> 05:59.192
<i>and I just don't know how
to pass through to the other side,</i>

05:59.193 --> 06:02.488
<i>where everything is effortless.</i>

06:04.948 --> 06:07.241
<i>David, I need to know.</i>

06:07.242 --> 06:11.037
<i>How do you know
if it's too late to change?</i>

06:11.038 --> 06:14.791
<i>How can you tell
if it's still possible</i>

06:14.792 --> 06:16.293
<i>to begin again?</i>

06:20.214 --> 06:23.341
<i>I was doomed
to be a freak from the start.</i>

06:28.514 --> 06:30.891
<i>I still blame Mom and Dad for that,</i>

06:31.809 --> 06:33.894
<i>skipping me two grades ahead.</i>

06:35.145 --> 06:36.522
<i>I wasn't ready.</i>

06:53.747 --> 06:55.082
That one over there.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.089
<i>But the worst part was</i>

07:02.339 --> 07:04.716
<i>I was still smarter
than everyone else.</i>

07:11.181 --> 07:13.142
<i>I never told you about Doug...</i>

07:14.685 --> 07:17.311
<i>but I think that's
where this all began.</i>

07:17.312 --> 07:19.313
<i>I</i> know <i>that's where
this all began,</i>

07:19.314 --> 07:22.693
<i>because that was my first one,</i>

07:23.610 --> 07:26.029
<i>my very first experiment.</i>

07:45.299 --> 07:47.342
<i>Even 40 years later,</i>

07:47.551 --> 07:52.222
<i>I guess you can say that Doug
was the only real friend I ever had.</i>

08:01.064 --> 08:05.067
Eight, seven, six, five,

08:05.068 --> 08:08.446
four, three, two, one!

08:08.447 --> 08:10.657
Lift off!

09:20.352 --> 09:21.395
Aah!

09:23.981 --> 09:25.189
Get him!

09:25.190 --> 09:26.524
Get him out of here!

09:26.525 --> 09:28.109
Get out of here!

09:28.110 --> 09:29.986
Leave! Leave!

09:29.987 --> 09:31.654
Throw it in his eye!

09:31.655 --> 09:33.073
Get out of here!

11:54.881 --> 11:56.216
Aah!

12:03.598 --> 12:05.976
- Hey, Timmy.
- Hey, Ted.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.022
What'd you learn in math today?

12:12.023 --> 12:15.276
Dang. Miss Chipman sucks,

12:15.277 --> 12:18.529
and these quadratics
are just giving me a headache,

12:18.530 --> 12:22.200
and she can't even explain
why we'd ever use one.

12:23.285 --> 12:24.618
She can't?

12:24.619 --> 12:25.620
Yeah.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.664
But they're everywhere.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.751
Wh-When you throw a ball,

12:31.752 --> 12:35.589
when you shoot a gun,
that's quadratics.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.840
<i>David, I keep asking</i>

12:37.841 --> 12:40.885
<i>how'd I go from this innocent
little kid to this?</i>

12:40.886 --> 12:42.428
...have the right equation.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.473
<i>I think it was Harvard that did it.</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:46.933
<i>You don't know about that, either,</i>

12:47.768 --> 12:49.102
<i>about Murray,</i>

12:49.811 --> 12:50.895
<i>about everything.</i>

12:53.523 --> 12:55.942
<i>Mom and Dad, they loved that,</i>

12:56.401 --> 12:58.861
<i>"My son attending Harvard."</i>

12:58.862 --> 13:01.155
<i>Can you imagine
how lonely that was,</i>

13:01.156 --> 13:03.824

- Thank you.

14:06.012 --> 14:10.558
<i>Professor Henry Murray,
he was everything I wanted to be,</i>

14:10.559 --> 14:13.144
<i>a beaming Greek god
of Harvardness.</i>

14:14.396 --> 14:17.356
Get these out as quickly
and as efficiently as possible.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.441
I have full confidence in you.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.406
<i>As soon as we entered the room,</i>

14:25.407 --> 14:27.783
<i>we were all desperate
to make the cut,</i>

14:27.784 --> 14:29.493
<i>for him to select us,</i>

14:29.494 --> 14:32.455
<i>bring us into the inner circle
of the fold.</i>

14:33.707 --> 14:35.958
<i>His was a hand of God,</i>

14:35.959 --> 14:38.920
<i>separating sheep from goats.</i>

14:52.767 --> 14:55.770
Gentlemen, if I call your number,
please stand and remain standing.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.648
Number 1...

14:59.733 --> 15:01.734
5,

15:01.735 --> 15:04.486
21, 24,

15:04.487 --> 15:07.073
47, and 89.

15:07.449 --> 15:08.365
If you are standing,

15:08.366 --> 15:10.910
thank you for your participation today.

15:10.911 --> 15:11.912
You may leave now.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.415
Please keep your papers facedown

15:16.124 --> 15:17.792
until I say begin.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.045
Begin.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.047
Number 4...

15:23.798 --> 15:25.007
7,

15:25.008 --> 15:26.759
8,

15:26.760 --> 15:28.260
15,

15:28.261 --> 15:29.638
23,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.765
37,

15:32.766 --> 15:34.350

15:36.770 --> 15:38.270
80,

15:38.271 --> 15:41.524
91, 96.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.694
Congratulations.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.989
If you're still here,
you've made the cut.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.952
Individual sessions
will start next week.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.334
<i>Nobody in my life ever asked me</i>

16:00.335 --> 16:02.711
<i>how I was doing or if I was okay</i>

16:02.712 --> 16:04.672
<i>or even if I knew what time it was.</i>

16:04.673 --> 16:07.257
Theodore,
thank you for coming by.

16:07.258 --> 16:11.178
<i>And here was this
Harvard professor asking me</i>

16:11.179 --> 16:13.222
<i>what I thought about the world,
listening.</i>

16:13.223 --> 16:14.807
It's a wonderful office you have.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.102
<i>Taking notes, even, when I spoke.
Imagine that.</i>

16:18.103 --> 16:23.399
<i>It was as if Christ himself came down
and asked me about my life.</i>

16:23.400 --> 16:27.903
Well, we work so hard to justify
emotional responses with morality

16:27.904 --> 16:30.864
that the--the moral code
becomes so attenuated

16:30.865 --> 16:32.324
as to be meaningless.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.577
And do you think that
that's an inevitability?

16:35.578 --> 16:37.705
I think it has to be specific
to each individual...

16:37.706 --> 16:39.498
<i>It was almost a year of that.</i>

16:39.499 --> 16:43.419
<i>Those weekly trips to the annex
were like heaven to me.</i>

16:43.420 --> 16:45.713
I mean, science thinks
it has this perfect,

16:45.714 --> 16:47.965
empirical evidence
of everything in the universe,

16:47.966 --> 16:50.885
but it actually can't tell us
anything about people.

16:54.014 --> 16:55.806
Two poodles
looking at each other.

16:55.807 --> 16:57.516
Don't you think
there's a sense

16:57.517 --> 17:00.185
in which freedom
is only what we call it?

17:00.186 --> 17:03.230
Call it prison and not,
say, a monastery.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.482
What makes a monastery
different from a prison

17:05.483 --> 17:07.860
is that the monks can leave
if they wanted to.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.737
They have self-determination.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.698
...science, we read this article
about stress effects in mice.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.366
You put two mice in a cage,

17:14.367 --> 17:17.077
and then they're fine--
happy, live long lives.

17:17.078 --> 17:20.289
You put 20 mice in the same cage,

17:20.290 --> 17:22.542
it messes them up psychologically.

17:26.629 --> 17:30.632
I basically feel
that technological society

17:30.633 --> 17:32.968
is incompatible
with individual freedom,

17:32.969 --> 17:34.762
and, therefore,
we have to destroy it

17:34.763 --> 17:36.722
and replace it with
a more primitive society

17:36.723 --> 17:38.265
so that people
can be free again.

17:38.266 --> 17:40.184
<i>Nothing was off-limits between us.</i>

17:40.185 --> 17:42.978
<i>We talked about everything,
every crevice of my life,</i>

17:42.979 --> 17:44.521
<i>my dreams, my fears.</i>

17:44.522 --> 17:46.732
I'm self-taught, you know.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.777
My father couldn't
comprehend chess.

17:49.778 --> 17:53.113
<i>And he appreciated me
for who I really was.</i>

17:53.114 --> 17:55.115
Personally, I never
understood the appeal

17:55.116 --> 17:57.242
- of a woman's backside.
- No?

17:57.243 --> 18:00.370
Except perhaps a Negro woman.

18:05.919 --> 18:07.211
Thank you
for joining us today, Judge.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.754
Oh, absolutely.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.757
Morning, Mr. Kaczynski.
We'll be right along.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.678
Well, maybe I'll have one, too,
if we have a minute.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.850
Balkan Sobranies, huh?

18:21.518 --> 18:23.435
Good man.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.145
These are some friends of mine, Ted,

18:25.146 --> 18:27.064
with the federal government.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.484
Theodore is one
of my star subjects.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.488
He's been sharing some
very interesting ideas with us.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.116
Let's go this way.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.244
We're trying something
a little different today.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.620
Those government men are here

18:41.621 --> 18:43.080
because this study
is not just about

18:43.081 --> 18:45.707
expanding the boundaries
of psychological sciences.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.378
You're part of something
much bigger than yourself, Ted.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.590
This is important for the future
of the free world.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.079
I can't really move.

19:23.454 --> 19:27.542
Well, you can walk out
anytime you want.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.543
You know that, right,
Theodore?

19:29.544 --> 19:31.670
Yeah. No, I'm--
I'm okay, Professor.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.797
Good man.

19:33.756 --> 19:38.678
Over the past year, you've provided us
with hundreds of pages of material

19:39.512 --> 19:41.764
laying out your philosophy of life,

19:42.182 --> 19:45.101
your dreams for your own future,
and the future of the world.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.187
It's been wonderful
getting to know you,

19:48.188 --> 19:51.356
getting to see inside the deepest
recesses of your mind.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.526
I hope that you feel that you've
been fully honest with me,

19:54.527 --> 19:57.279
that your work truly represents
who you are

19:57.280 --> 19:58.864
and what you believe.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.282
Of course.

20:00.283 --> 20:03.702
I've really enjoyed our conversations
and the assignments, too.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.621
I wouldn't hold anything
back from you.

20:05.622 --> 20:06.705
- Good.
- Yeah.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.499
Let's begin.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.302
I've taken the liberty
of sharing those pages

20:20.303 --> 20:22.054
with a panel of fellow scientists,

20:22.055 --> 20:25.182
some of Harvard's
most distinguished thinkers.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.267
I'm flattered.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.437
- Good morning.
- Unfortunately,

20:30.146 --> 20:32.232
their conclusions were unanimous.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.984
They found the majority
of your ideas to be derivative,

20:35.985 --> 20:38.320
clichéd, and juvenile.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.366
The remainder they found
self-evidently absurd.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.910
Well, Professor, I'd be happy
to explain myself further--

20:44.911 --> 20:47.121
Let's take a look at the film
from our last session.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.125
I'll help clarify their findings.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.426
<i>I basically feel
that technological society</i>

21:01.427 --> 21:04.263
<i>is incompatible
with individual freedom,</i>

21:04.264 --> 21:06.431
<i>and, therefore,
we have to destroy it</i>

21:06.432 --> 21:09.226
<i>and replace it
with a more primitive society</i>

21:09.227 --> 21:11.186
<i>so that people can be free.</i>

21:11.187 --> 21:13.438
Our reviewers found this
to be a tepid,

21:13.439 --> 21:16.900
sophomoric regurgitation
of Jacques Ellul.

21:16.901 --> 21:18.443
You talk so much about autonomy,

21:18.444 --> 21:21.238
but you've stolen all of your ideas

21:21.239 --> 21:23.865
from a third-rate thinker's
mass-market paperback.

21:23.866 --> 21:26.535
Well, I didn't claim
that my ideas were--

21:26.536 --> 21:28.412
Oh, wait.
Here's the best part!

21:28.413 --> 21:30.622
<i>Technology and the social structures
that it's created</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:34.668
<i>have made the individual passive,
powerless, trapped by rules.</i>

21:34.669 --> 21:36.461
Delusional self-justification.

21:36.462 --> 21:40.674
"If only I were born among cavemen,
then I would have been a star."

21:40.675 --> 21:43.593
It couldn't be your own inadequacy
that's to blame.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.220
Well, that's totally
ad hominem. I--

21:45.221 --> 21:47.889
It couldn't be just
a mediocre mathematician

21:47.890 --> 21:50.225
grasping to some justification
of his own failures.

21:50.226 --> 21:54.313
No, it must be that the whole system
is completely wrong,

21:54.314 --> 21:58.150
because, of course, you're more
perceptive than anybody else.

21:58.151 --> 21:59.609
Right, Ted?

21:59.610 --> 22:02.154
<i>We have to shed
all of the unnatural stuff</i>

22:02.155 --> 22:04.072
<i>and get back to nature.</i>

22:04.073 --> 22:06.491
If society broke down,
you wouldn't stand a chance...

22:06.492 --> 22:09.119
a creepy, beta-male shrimp like you!

22:09.120 --> 22:10.829
He'd be sodomized to death

22:10.830 --> 22:13.373
and turned into dog food
in 10 minutes.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.167
- He'd probably enjoy it.
- Now, now.

22:15.168 --> 22:16.835
Now, now.
I told you not to bring up

22:16.836 --> 22:19.838
Theodore's sadomasochistic
tendencies.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.882
That's not fair.

22:21.883 --> 22:24.343
<i>People will look at me,
and they'll respect me.</i>

22:24.344 --> 22:26.803
<i>They'll hear my ideas
and see that I'm right,</i>

22:26.804 --> 22:29.222
<i>and they'll make me
the ruler of the world.</i>

22:29.223 --> 22:32.517
When I wrote your mother
to get permission for this study,

22:32.518 --> 22:34.186
she didn't just sign
the permission slip.

22:34.187 --> 22:37.105
She sent a whole letter
back in return.

22:37.106 --> 22:39.107
"I'm afraid Theodore
is in desperate need

22:39.108 --> 22:40.985
"of psychological intervention.

22:41.986 --> 22:46.115
Many people regularly
call him a creep."

22:46.699 --> 22:48.742
Mom--Mom wouldn't say that.

22:48.743 --> 22:50.452
She wouldn't call me that.

22:50.453 --> 22:52.412
"He's a bed-wetter,

22:52.413 --> 22:55.791
"and he masturbates so excessively

22:55.792 --> 23:00.212
"that I worry about his mental
and physical ramifications.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.963
"He harbors delusions of grandeur

23:01.964 --> 23:06.635
"completely out of proportion to his
mental and physical capabilities.

23:06.636 --> 23:10.472
"Anything you could do
to fix my boy

23:10.473 --> 23:11.891
"would have my permission.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.142
Wanda Kaczynski."

23:34.122 --> 23:36.164
His mother really wrote that?

23:36.165 --> 23:38.751
Of course not.
We use the same letter for all of them.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.752
I imagine we could get
even better results

23:40.753 --> 23:42.379
with more customized verbiage,

23:42.380 --> 23:44.256
but I'd prefer to have
this phase be standardized.

23:44.257 --> 23:46.216
<i>Modern man has essentially
handed over the reins</i>

23:46.217 --> 23:47.968
<i>of how our society develops.</i>

23:47.969 --> 23:49.761
<i>I only found this out years later,</i>

23:49.762 --> 23:52.347
<i>but it's well documented.</i>

23:52.348 --> 23:54.099
<i>Murray was part of MKUltra,</i>

23:54.100 --> 23:57.227
<i>the CIA's vast
mind-control project,</i>

23:57.228 --> 23:59.521
<i>working to perfect
brainwashing techniques</i>

23:59.522 --> 24:02.190
<i>to use against Soviet spies</i>

24:02.191 --> 24:05.403
<i>to break them permanently
and change their core beliefs.</i>

24:06.362 --> 24:10.074
<i>And we were the guinea pigs.</i>

24:10.616 --> 24:14.953
<i>He selected the most vulnerable
to see if we could be broken.</i>

24:14.954 --> 24:19.875
<i>And the other kids,
they were at least 18 or 19.</i>

24:19.876 --> 24:21.918
<i>I was 16 years old.</i>

24:36.809 --> 24:38.519
Let's get those electrodes off.

24:53.451 --> 24:57.829
Theodore, you did a wonderful job.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.082
You truly exceeded my expectations.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.794
You did so very well.

25:04.795 --> 25:09.175
I couldn't have asked for more
as a subject or as a friend.

25:11.761 --> 25:14.096
I can't wait to see
how well you do next time.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.391
Next time?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.645
This phase will continue
for about 18 months.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.981
I'm anticipating more
great things from you, Ted.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.859
Oh. Um...

25:28.528 --> 25:30.988
I never believed any of that stuff
anyway, you know?

25:32.198 --> 25:35.325
Is that right?
I thought you believed strongly--

25:35.326 --> 25:37.078
I never really believed any of it.

25:38.287 --> 25:40.789
Those ideas were just--

25:40.790 --> 25:43.416
Well, they were stupid,

25:43.417 --> 25:44.669
juvenile.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.505
Well,

25:48.172 --> 25:49.340
either way.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.471
I will see you next week.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.227
Ted.

26:05.314 --> 26:07.108
Your cigarettes.

26:40.808 --> 26:42.393
- Ted.
- Huh.

26:43.352 --> 26:44.477
Ted. Hey, Ted.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.354
Uh, I'm finished,

26:46.355 --> 26:48.357
and I saw where you
tried to trick me.

26:48.608 --> 26:50.192
Nice try.

26:51.694 --> 26:54.572
Oh, uh, Timmy, see?

26:55.364 --> 26:58.159
You got a good head
for mathematics.

26:58.743 --> 27:00.953
That's special.
Not everybody has that.

27:02.246 --> 27:03.496
Very good.

27:03.497 --> 27:05.332
Actually, could I ask you
a question...

27:05.333 --> 27:06.583
- Sure.
- ...privately?

27:06.584 --> 27:08.711
I can't really ask my mom.

27:13.507 --> 27:14.800
Theresa.

27:15.676 --> 27:16.926
Can we go for a walk?

27:16.927 --> 27:18.929
Oh, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.893
They're on me
every single day.

27:24.894 --> 27:28.938
They call me pigeon-boy,
and they bend my fingers back.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.192
And my mom, she just says,
"Be yourself,"

27:32.193 --> 27:34.152
but that's mom stuff.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.488
I need man-to-man advice.

27:36.489 --> 27:39.032
These kinds of people,
they prey on fear and weakness,

27:39.033 --> 27:40.659
and they respect only strength.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.953
You should be doing push-ups,
sit-ups, every day.

27:43.954 --> 27:46.623
Soon, they'll sense your strength,
and they'll leave you alone.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.583
You won't even need to fight them.

27:48.584 --> 27:52.003
That's good dad advice.
I'll start tonight,

27:52.004 --> 27:55.132
and if they try to mess
with me, bam.

27:55.633 --> 27:57.676
- I'll make 'em pay.
- Well, you won't need to.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.553
That's the beauty of it.

28:00.554 --> 28:03.766
I want to.
I want to get even.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.105
You don't need to get even, Timmy.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.649
You don't.

28:16.404 --> 28:20.949
What the world thinks about you,
what those bullies say about you,

28:20.950 --> 28:22.785
none of it matters.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.955
You <i>are</i> different from those kids.
That's a good thing.

28:27.081 --> 28:29.249
You do see the world differently.

28:29.250 --> 28:33.003
That's a good thing,
and that's not "mom stuff."

28:34.338 --> 28:38.091
It takes incredible
strength and courage

28:38.092 --> 28:39.843
to be different
from everybody else,

28:39.844 --> 28:41.512
but it's a good thing.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.347
I promise you.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.850
Hey.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.768
I promise you.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.605
All right.

28:53.149 --> 28:55.985
Oh, hold on a second.

28:58.654 --> 29:02.031
Here. We're having a party
for my birthday.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.825
- Do you think you can come?
- Oh, well--

29:03.826 --> 29:05.785
You don't need to bring
a present or anything.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.370
- We'll have a cake.
- That's really--

29:10.458 --> 29:13.627
I'm--I'm not--
I'm not sure I can make it.

29:16.130 --> 29:17.839
It--It's just a small party.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.300
- Yeah.
- I don't have very many friends.

29:20.301 --> 29:22.051
Um, you don't have to come,
though.

29:22.052 --> 29:24.054
No, I want to come. I just...

29:25.347 --> 29:28.058
I'm...busy.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.187
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

29:32.229 --> 29:33.856
I'll try, okay?

29:35.107 --> 29:37.485
- Okay?
- Yeah.

29:39.487 --> 29:42.280
Now, you--
You get on back, now.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.491
All right.

29:45.743 --> 29:48.953
<i>Murray spent a year seducing me</i>

29:48.954 --> 29:51.415
<i>and then spent two years
breaking me.</i>

29:52.541 --> 29:53.793
<i>Two years.</i>

29:54.919 --> 29:57.171
<i>Why'd I keep going back?</i>

29:58.088 --> 29:59.631
<i>To prove to them</i>

29:59.632 --> 30:03.384
<i>that they can strap me
into an electric chair,</i>

30:03.385 --> 30:05.887
<i>but I will never give in.</i>

30:05.888 --> 30:08.807
<i>They will never break me.</i>

30:08.808 --> 30:10.142
<i>And they didn't.</i>

30:10.518 --> 30:11.936
<i>I didn't break.</i>

30:13.395 --> 30:16.982
<i>They did not break me.</i>

32:18.854 --> 32:20.314
<i>I can stop now.</i>

32:21.690 --> 32:23.651
<i>I</i> can <i>stop.</i>

32:24.693 --> 32:28.697
<i>But every time my mind drifts,</i>

32:28.906 --> 32:31.450
<i>it goes back to that room
at Harvard.</i>

32:32.868 --> 32:35.870
<i>Whenever I close my eyes,
I'm there,</i>

32:35.871 --> 32:37.830
<i>strapped to that chair,</i>

32:37.831 --> 32:41.417
<i>helpless, angry, impotent,</i>

32:41.418 --> 32:43.212
<i>stripped of all respect,</i>

32:44.129 --> 32:47.966
<i>and I feel so much anger.</i>

33:13.325 --> 33:16.286
<i>I've been living on anger
my whole life.</i>

33:19.164 --> 33:21.541
<i>Anyone I ever loved,</i>

33:21.542 --> 33:24.585
<i>anyone I ever admired</i>

33:24.586 --> 33:26.045
<i>betrayed me.</i>

33:26.046 --> 33:27.630
<i>- Mom...</i>
- You sold me out!

33:27.631 --> 33:29.507
You made me look bad
to Professor Murray!

33:29.508 --> 33:30.758
Why would you write that letter?

33:30.759 --> 33:32.885
What letter?
I signed a permission slip,

33:32.886 --> 33:33.886
because you asked me to.

33:33.887 --> 33:35.972
<i>Doug...</i>

33:35.973 --> 33:37.641
<i>Murray...</i>

33:38.684 --> 33:40.561
<i>and you, too, David.</i>

33:43.313 --> 33:44.523
<i>Even you.</i>

33:45.816 --> 33:48.526
I'm gonna get you!

33:48.527 --> 33:50.154
Now I'm gonna get you!

34:09.965 --> 34:12.384
Roll back.

34:13.427 --> 34:14.678
Couple times.

34:21.643 --> 34:24.521
Hey. How about a smile?

34:38.619 --> 34:40.703
You gotta take these down.
People are coming--

34:40.704 --> 34:41.704
Ted.

34:41.705 --> 34:44.165
Ted, stop it.
Come on.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.124
Stop.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.502
Ted.

34:49.338 --> 34:51.214
Hello? Hey!

34:51.215 --> 34:53.717
Hey! Okay, fine!
Then go home! You're fired.

35:11.151 --> 35:14.863
<i>Betrayal after betrayal
after betrayal...</i>

35:20.119 --> 35:22.329
<i>till I couldn't trust anyone.</i>

35:24.706 --> 35:26.458
<i>I want them to listen to me.</i>

35:28.710 --> 35:31.337
<i>I want them to pay
for what they did to me.</i>

35:59.408 --> 36:02.744
<i>Well, let them hate me,</i>

36:03.036 --> 36:04.538
