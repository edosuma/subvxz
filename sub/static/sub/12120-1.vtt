WEBVTT

00:51.710 --> 00:54.970
Remember this morning
when our lives were approaching normal?

00:55.050 --> 00:56.300
Vaguely.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.180
I have a feeling I moved out of my house,

00:59.260 --> 01:00.970
- had sex with Sol.
- Yeah.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.020
I still had a boyfriend.

01:03.140 --> 01:06.560
Wow, it was an eventful ten hours.

01:06.650 --> 01:10.360
Well, we're old.
We have to pack a lot of shit into a day.

01:10.440 --> 01:13.740
-I want a martini.
-You say that a lot.

01:13.820 --> 01:17.110
I mean it a lot.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.080
Hey, wait!
No, where are you going?

01:20.160 --> 01:22.620
You have to wash the sand
off your feet first.

01:22.700 --> 01:26.170
Oh, God, Grace, we have
so much more to wash off than sand.

01:26.250 --> 01:28.000
Well, let's start with the sand.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.960
-No, no, no! Drought, drought!
-Oh.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.760
You use this for the sand.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.260
Is that my baby powder?

01:36.340 --> 01:39.220
-It's our baby powder.
-It's got my name on it.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.810
So stop writing your name
on our baby powder. Oh--

01:42.890 --> 01:44.810
Hey, make a wish.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.350
Good idea.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.230
You too.
Here, let me get one of your--

01:50.310 --> 01:53.690
Yeah, no! No, you pull one
and the whole strip comes off.

01:53.780 --> 01:58.240
It's like pulling a thread,
my whole face starts to unravel.

01:58.320 --> 02:01.410
-But I wanted you to have a wish, too.
-No, I'm fine.

02:01.490 --> 02:02.790
Ow!

02:03.830 --> 02:06.620
Think of it as an eyelash
that grows out of your chin.

02:06.710 --> 02:09.169
Oh, my God, it's huge!

02:09.250 --> 02:10.750
How long has that been there?

02:11.670 --> 02:15.260
How many times do I have to tell you?
If you see something, say something.

02:15.340 --> 02:18.680
I was going to, I wanted to,
but I got attached to it.

02:18.760 --> 02:20.220
You looked like a kitty.

02:20.300 --> 02:23.350
-Oh.
-Make a wish, Mittens.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.230
So what'd you wish for?

02:30.310 --> 02:32.650
I wished for a baby smooth chin.

02:32.730 --> 02:35.400
-That's it?
-Well, I couldn't think of anything else.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.910
I mean, you were sitting there with
your lips all pursed over your finger.

02:38.990 --> 02:40.110
It was a lot of pressure.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.160
Oh, what about that guy
you were talking about?

02:43.240 --> 02:47.250
You know, the guy that you sorta,
kinda, mighta had a thing with?

02:47.330 --> 02:50.880
Bill? Will. Gil. Alan.

02:50.960 --> 02:54.920
Phil. No. Phil Milstein is not my wish.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.220
He was... something else
and that was a long time ago.

03:00.550 --> 03:02.010
How about you? What's your wish?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.510
Well, I was hoping you would ask.

03:06.520 --> 03:10.730
Grace, today I wish
to discover the real Frankie.

03:10.810 --> 03:12.940
The Frankie without Sol.

03:13.020 --> 03:15.020
I could be an entirely new person.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.650
Maybe my fingerprints will change. Again.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.280
- Maybe my voice will lower.
- Hello, Grace.

03:22.360 --> 03:25.530
-I've been working so--
-Shh. That's my wish.

03:25.620 --> 03:26.660
Shh.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.580
-Shh--
-No. Only I shush.

04:05.070 --> 04:06.370
Robert?

04:12.750 --> 04:14.040
Robert?

04:19.050 --> 04:22.180
Oh, God! Robert!

04:22.260 --> 04:24.840
You know what else I could be without Sol?

04:24.930 --> 04:28.970
Taller. And I will have
a totally new fashion sense.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.180
I'm not dressing for him anymore.

04:31.270 --> 04:34.900
Oh. I didn't realize
you were dressing for anyone.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.110
- <i> Don't enable him.</i>
- Oh, sweet mother of teenage Jesus,

04:38.190 --> 04:39.230
-it's him.
<i>-Don't enable him.</i>

04:39.320 --> 04:41.690
I'm not jumping every time he calls.

04:41.780 --> 04:44.820
Do me a favor, will ya?
Put that on vibrate?

04:44.910 --> 04:46.620
Absolutely not.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.490
Then I might be inclined to enable him.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.450
<i>-Don't enable him. Don't enable him.</i>
-Oh, that's...

04:51.540 --> 04:53.960
Sol, she doesn't want to talk.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.500
Oh-- OK. We'll be right there.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.840
No! We who? Not me.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.300
Robert's had a heart attack.

05:03.380 --> 05:04.380
Oh, come on.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.300
Wait, do you think Sol told Robert about,
you know, before?

05:07.390 --> 05:10.640
-The candles, the bed sex?
-I don't know, Frankie.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.230
Do you think that's why Robert
had the heart attack?

05:13.270 --> 05:16.150
-Do you think I'm responsible?
-I don't know, Frankie.

05:16.230 --> 05:20.230
But I'm the one that told Sol
he was a schmuck if he didn't tell Robert.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.780
Oh, wow. Oh, you must feel horrible.

05:25.820 --> 05:30.950
<i> Dr. Gold, dial 2-1-1.</i>
<i>Dr. Gold, dial 2-1-1.</i>

05:35.040 --> 05:38.290
Excuse me, the man in this bed
said he was very thirsty.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.000
-He can have ice chips.
-When ice chips melt,

05:40.090 --> 05:41.710
they become water,
so why can't he have water?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.590
He can have ice chips.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.590
It's like talking to your mother.

05:50.220 --> 05:52.470
Oh, God. Robert.

05:53.310 --> 05:54.980
How is he?

05:58.100 --> 06:00.110
- Stable.
- How bad was it?

06:00.190 --> 06:02.900
-They don't know.
-Well, when are they gonna find out?

06:02.980 --> 06:05.240
They have to do a test.
He might need surgery.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.070
- Oh, good Lord.
- What happened?

06:07.150 --> 06:10.870
I don't know. I walked in and he was
face down on the kitchen table.

06:10.950 --> 06:13.120
And you didn't say anything
that could cause his face

06:13.200 --> 06:15.410
to land on the kitchen table?

06:15.500 --> 06:18.040
No. I came home to tell him,
but I never had a chance.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.880
Grace? Is that you, sweetheart?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.630
-You didn't have to come.
-Of course I did.

06:26.260 --> 06:27.340
How you feeling?

06:27.420 --> 06:30.510
I'm warm and fuzzy all over.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.760
It's like I just came out of the dryer.

06:32.850 --> 06:36.270
-Well, you're sedated.
-And you're Frankie.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.980
-Hi, Robert.
-There's nothing to be afraid of, love.

06:41.060 --> 06:42.440
Come in.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.690
No, no.

06:43.770 --> 06:45.070
She'll be right there.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.660
Grace.

06:49.740 --> 06:53.580
-He just saw you. You have to go in.
-No, I don't think I can.

06:53.660 --> 06:56.250
He's an-- He's an Irish lawyer,
for God's sake.

06:56.330 --> 06:58.460
He's like a human lie detector.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.830
I can't go in there and face gay Matlock.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.540
Robert asked for cats for dinner.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.590
You'll be fine if you just
take it down a notch.

07:04.670 --> 07:08.050
No, you take it down a notch.
You're not the boss of my notches.

07:08.130 --> 07:09.800
OK, take it to any notch you want.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.220
You want me to go in there
and lie for you.

07:12.300 --> 07:14.390
This isn't for me, it's for Robert.

07:17.680 --> 07:18.980
OK.

07:22.900 --> 07:24.270
Mm.

07:27.030 --> 07:29.400
Hey, you. I'm here.

07:29.490 --> 07:31.410
There she is.

07:31.490 --> 07:33.780
Honestly, you didn't even have to come.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.990
Of course I did. Why wouldn't I come?

07:36.080 --> 07:38.080
What am I? A heartless monster...

07:38.750 --> 07:40.960
...with no moral compass?

07:44.040 --> 07:46.090
Forgive me. I...

07:48.050 --> 07:51.090
It's Robert Hanson. Not Robert Handsome.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.180
That's not a name for a person.

07:53.260 --> 07:56.390
He had a heart attack,
if you can search by that.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.520
OK. I--
Now you just typed in "Bobert."

08:00.600 --> 08:03.190
You did. That's-- What--

08:03.270 --> 08:04.900
Oh, my God.
Mallory, where the hell are you?

08:04.980 --> 08:06.520
Right behind you. Hi.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.570
How's Daddy?
Does he need surgery? Is--

08:10.650 --> 08:12.570
Still haven't taken him down for the test.

08:12.650 --> 08:14.530
OK, so we can see him? Right?

08:14.610 --> 08:17.160
Um, if she ever gives us his room number.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.450
Room twenty-two-eighty-four.

08:19.540 --> 08:21.250
-Thank you.
-OK.

08:21.330 --> 08:24.540
-Great. OK.
-Not a people-person, are you?

08:24.620 --> 08:26.380
I like that about you. Thank you.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.590
Seriously, you were in bed at 7:15?
That's how boring married life is?

08:31.670 --> 08:34.090
It was family themed dinner.
Tonight's like drama night.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.299
-It was-- Never mind.
-That's really sad. OK.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.679
You ready for this?

08:42.770 --> 08:43.770
Nope.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.940
- Where's Sol?
- He went to get some ice for you.

08:48.020 --> 08:49.110
What time is it?

08:50.530 --> 08:53.570
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Is he OK?

08:54.860 --> 08:56.620
-He's getting ready for a test.
-OK.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.820
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:57.910 --> 08:59.910
- Hi.
- Daddy.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.250
-Hi.
-Are you OK? Can I get you anything?

09:02.330 --> 09:03.540
-Are you in pain?
-I'm fine.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.210
I just want to get outta here.

09:05.290 --> 09:08.250
I can't believe this happened. We were
just at your house like an hour before.

09:08.340 --> 09:11.760
It's nobody's fault!
Stop blaming yourself!

09:11.840 --> 09:14.130
Frankie, you need to find
a way to calm down!

09:14.220 --> 09:16.090
No, you're gonna have to
find a way to calm down

09:16.180 --> 09:18.220
about me not calming down.

09:18.300 --> 09:20.350
What happened, Dad? Do you remember?

09:20.430 --> 09:24.270
I was practicing my vows.
Then I was in an ambulance.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.770
Girls, girls, don't hover.
He's gotta rest.

09:26.850 --> 09:29.980
-OK. Mom.
-I know.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.360
They're gonna find out what's wrong
and they're gonna fix it.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.190
-Goodness.
-What?

09:34.280 --> 09:35.610
You're a little meatier.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.360
I may have gained a little weight.

09:37.450 --> 09:39.530
Well, you can take it off easily.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.450
You've got my metabolism.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.000
Did my mother just call my sister fat?

09:44.080 --> 09:47.500
Just aside from my father almost dying,
this is the best day of my life.

09:47.580 --> 09:49.210
-Thank you.
-Look what I've got!

09:49.290 --> 09:50.880
There you are!

09:51.840 --> 09:56.430
Hi. I'm here to take Mr. Handsome down
for a heart, um...

09:56.510 --> 09:59.220
-cathe-ziration?
-Catheterization.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.810
And you need to know the last time
he ate was six hours ago, not eight.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.350
Is-Is that gonna be a problem?

10:05.140 --> 10:08.310
And, um, are there any potential risks
involved with these tests?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.980
-Hello?
-Uh, Marcus Welby,

10:11.060 --> 10:14.150
-you're talking to the orderly.
-I-I know that! I'm--

10:14.230 --> 10:15.820
I'm just trying to get answers.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.990
You know, like,
where are they gonna put the line?

10:18.070 --> 10:21.530
In the groin or the wrist?
'Cause the wrist is way more dangerous.

10:21.620 --> 10:25.540
- Where is the doctor?
- Does anybody work here?

10:25.620 --> 10:27.710
I'm sure she'll be here soon.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Welby.

10:27.790 --> 10:31.920
Grace, the ER doctor said they're
gonna put the tube through his groin.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.250
-Well, good. That's better.
-Better for whom?

10:34.340 --> 10:36.340
Don't worry, honey. It's going to be fine.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.090
I'll give you $500, young man,

10:38.180 --> 10:39.720
if you get 'em to put the tube
in my wrist.

10:39.800 --> 10:41.800
-Don't listen to him.
-Don't pay any attention to him.

10:41.890 --> 10:45.140
-Six hundred.
-Come on, Chubs. Let's walk with them.

10:45.220 --> 10:47.600
And we'll take little breaks
so you don't get winded.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.900
Are you OK?

10:49.980 --> 10:52.060
Me? I'm fine. I'm fine.

10:52.150 --> 10:55.690
-You're the one that--
-No. Shh-shh. Shh.

10:56.440 --> 11:00.110
You're very Grace right now.
I mean, there's a lot of Grace going on.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.280
Well,
that's better than lurking in the corner.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.990
I mean, somebody's gotta be responsible.

11:05.080 --> 11:09.330
OK, I vote for you. Go.
Do something. Be responsible.

11:09.420 --> 11:11.540
-I'm gonna go get us coffee.
-All right.

11:11.630 --> 11:14.590
-Calm down.
-Oh, will you--

11:14.670 --> 11:17.170
I will ask if they'll put ice cream in it.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.270
-Hey, Dad.
-Oh, hi.

11:30.350 --> 11:33.940
-Robert, how are you?
-They're gonna put a tube in my groin.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.650
I thought that he had a heart attack.

11:35.730 --> 11:39.070
-He's going for a test.
-It's to see if he needs surgery.

11:39.150 --> 11:40.570
Well, he's feisty.

11:40.650 --> 11:42.320
That's a-- That's a good sign, right?

11:42.410 --> 11:45.240
Yeah, if he's interviewing
for a job as a girl reporter.

11:45.740 --> 11:46.620
Whoa.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.950
What?

11:49.040 --> 11:51.370
-You clean up nice.
-What'd I do?

11:51.460 --> 11:53.630
-She was going on a date with--
-No one.

11:53.710 --> 11:56.670
-No one named Barry.
-Barry!

11:56.750 --> 11:57.960
The guy we met at the movie theater?

11:58.050 --> 12:00.340
The one that you're technically
sexually harassing?

12:00.420 --> 12:01.470
-Yes, that one.
-Ooh.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.430
<i>Code blue, room 2235.</i>

12:03.510 --> 12:06.180
-Excuse me.
<i>-Code blue, room 2235.</i>

12:09.100 --> 12:10.640
Hey.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.650
Your dad's gonna be OK.

12:12.730 --> 12:13.770
Yeah.

12:15.310 --> 12:16.980
Yeah.

12:17.070 --> 12:20.530
Any way you can do this
without breathing into my mouth?

12:22.490 --> 12:23.740
Ow.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.910
Mm.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.500
Nacho taco caliente.

12:32.580 --> 12:35.880
How do you do that?
You're like a useless machine.

12:37.840 --> 12:42.010
Kids, go home.
There's no reason to stay all night.

12:42.090 --> 12:45.090
He's right.
We'll call you if something happens, huh?

12:45.180 --> 12:47.010
You heard the man. Let's hit it.

12:47.100 --> 12:52.020
Frankie?
I think we really need to process.

12:53.850 --> 12:56.940
Oh, boy.
This could take a while. Go on.

12:57.020 --> 12:59.530
I'll walk you down. Come on.

12:59.610 --> 13:01.400
- I love you, Mama.
- Love you.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.280
- Good night.
- Love you, Bud.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.120
What?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.620
It's just I haven't seen you since...

13:15.710 --> 13:17.330
I want to make sure we're...

13:17.420 --> 13:20.750
And on top of everything
I can't believe I was so stupid.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.420
That's what you want to process?
Your stupidity?

13:24.510 --> 13:26.760
It's just, I risked everything.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.800
What was I thinking? I...

13:28.890 --> 13:30.760
I really fucked up.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.520
This was the fuck up?

13:34.600 --> 13:36.480
Not your 20 year affair?

13:36.560 --> 13:38.730
Not all the lies you told me?

13:38.810 --> 13:41.900
One night with the woman
you spent 40 years with

13:41.980 --> 13:46.570
in the house where we raised our children?

13:48.320 --> 13:49.870
That's the fuck up?

13:54.000 --> 13:56.040
That's fucked up.

14:14.310 --> 14:17.350
-Hi there. I'm Dr. Rossmore.
-Hello.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.650
Do you-- Do you--
Do you have the results of the test?

14:19.730 --> 14:21.610
Yes, I do. Are you Mrs. Hanson?

14:21.690 --> 14:26.320
No, I'm-- I'm his ex-wife. But I am
the most competent person in the room.

14:26.400 --> 14:29.700
-So you must be the wife.
-No, no, I'm-- I'm his... ex-wife.

14:29.780 --> 14:33.080
-But that is not how I define myself.
-I'm the one you talk to.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.120
I need to stop guessing.
I never get it anymore.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.080
It's OK. Everyone here is family.
Now please, tell me what the test said.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.290
We found some acute blockages
in your arteries

14:41.380 --> 14:43.710
-and you're gonna need a bypass.
-A bypass?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.710
- Yes.
- Oh, dear.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.720
I think it would be best
if we did this as soon as possible

14:48.800 --> 14:52.050
so we can probably get you
into an OR in a few hours.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.010
Oh, dear God.

14:54.100 --> 14:56.060
You're gonna have to open up my chest?

14:56.140 --> 15:00.270
No, we're gonna do an endoscopic bypass
which has a much quicker recovery.

15:00.350 --> 15:02.560
-We just go through the groin.
-Why not?

15:02.650 --> 15:04.360
Everyone else has been up in there today.

15:05.530 --> 15:07.900
Just hang in there, everybody.
Hopefully it won't be too long.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.200
Thank you. Thank you.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.370
I can't believe this is happening.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.910
You want me to rub your face?

15:14.990 --> 15:17.580
You want me to tie her down
so she won't rub your face?

15:17.660 --> 15:20.830
That's very sweet of both of you
but what I'd really like right now

15:20.920 --> 15:22.750
is to be alone with Sol, please.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.260
They're going into my heart, Sol.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.810
They're not taking a route
I would have preferred.

15:37.890 --> 15:40.520
-They're going to fix your heart.
-Of course.

15:40.600 --> 15:44.270
But the truth is, we don't know what's
going to happen in that operating room.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.900
Stop.

15:45.980 --> 15:48.690
You have to go in
with a positive attitude.

15:48.780 --> 15:52.780
-Studies have shown--
-Listen. I'm not afraid of dying.

15:52.870 --> 15:55.120
But I am afraid of dying

15:55.200 --> 15:57.870
before I get a chance to marry you.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.620
I've been waiting my whole life
to be with you.

16:02.710 --> 16:06.460
And I can't bear the thought
of never getting a chance to marry--

16:06.550 --> 16:08.630
We will get married.

16:08.710 --> 16:13.340
But you'll be fully recovered, and we'll
have all our friends and family there.

16:13.430 --> 16:15.970
I want to get married here.

16:16.050 --> 16:19.770
Today. Before the surgery.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.310
-We can't.
-Why not?

16:24.400 --> 16:27.860
- I, uh...
- "I, uh... I, uh..."

16:27.940 --> 16:30.070
-What?
-I don't have my dress!

16:34.070 --> 16:36.070
We already have the marriage license,

16:36.160 --> 16:38.370
and I'll bet there are plenty
of chaplains around here.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.910
I think your emotions
are getting the better of you.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.830
-From a man who knows.
-From a man who knows.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.290
You're going to deny a man
with a bad heart

16:47.380 --> 16:49.960
who's about to go under the knife?

16:51.550 --> 16:53.930
My heart may not be strong right now...

16:54.720 --> 16:56.600
but it knows what it wants.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.720
And that, my love, is you.

17:01.180 --> 17:04.140
-Fucknuts!
-And he wants to do it before the surgery.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.730
-Oh.
-If he wants to get married,

17:05.810 --> 17:06.859
let's get him married.

17:06.940 --> 17:10.530
-But without telling him what happened?
-Yes. Is there a problem?

17:10.609 --> 17:13.950
Yes, there's a problem when he finds out
the truth and I didn't tell him.

17:14.030 --> 17:16.700
-Talk about going through your groin.
-I can't do it.

17:16.780 --> 17:19.369
- What?
- What can't you do, Sol?

17:20.490 --> 17:22.119
Uh... a thing. Nothing.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.500
- Is this about the surgery?
- No, it's just a thing.

17:25.579 --> 17:27.670
-A nothing thing.
-A thing you can't tell us.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.340
-Yes.
-Mom?

17:29.420 --> 17:33.840
Robert wants to get married before
the surgery and Sol is refusing to do it.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.930
Because of the thing!

17:36.010 --> 17:37.470
-What thing?
-Holy shit, Sol,

17:37.550 --> 17:39.510
my father is having his heart stopped.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.470
If you know something that we need
to know and you don't tell us right now,

17:42.560 --> 17:45.020
I will reach in and stop yours
with my bare hands.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.610
Oh, cheese and rice!

17:54.690 --> 17:58.200
-Kids, brace yourselves.
-Frankie, I really don't think

17:58.280 --> 17:59.700
you should bring the kids into this.

17:59.780 --> 18:03.080
Your father and I...
Well, Sol, to you two.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.330
But I think if he marries Robert,
he would like it if you'd call him Dad.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.120
-Mom!
-It's not gonna happen.

18:08.210 --> 18:11.170
We slept together at the house.
Robert does not know.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.130
Whoa.

18:17.220 --> 18:21.180
Oh, no. No, no, no. No.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.810
-You slept together?
-Heterosexually?

18:23.890 --> 18:26.310
This is gonna sound weird
coming from me,

18:26.390 --> 18:28.390
but that shows very poor judgment,
Mom.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.860
You're right. But it was great.

18:31.940 --> 18:35.780
No, not the sex. The sex was... meh.

18:35.860 --> 18:37.360
-Eh.
-Stop!

18:37.450 --> 18:40.070
But it was good because now
there can be closure.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.830
Well, it was good for me.

18:41.910 --> 18:43.910
This one thinks he made a huge mistake.

18:43.990 --> 18:46.410
-Gigantic.
-So now there's a new secret?

18:46.500 --> 18:49.370
Which is exactly why
I shouldn't marry him right now.

18:49.460 --> 18:51.290
Yeah, but what is
he gonna think if you don't?

18:51.380 --> 18:54.170
He doesn't need to know why. Yet.

18:54.250 --> 18:56.720
Couldn't I just tell him
I couldn't find the marriage license?

18:56.800 --> 18:58.970
Or-- Or there were no chaplains available?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.430
Yea-- No. No.
And stop making this about you.

19:01.510 --> 19:03.560
This is not about you anymore, Sol.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.560
-He is sick.
-I know.

19:05.640 --> 19:07.930
The most important thing
is to get him through this.

19:08.020 --> 19:09.480
I know.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.650
I love him, too.

19:12.730 --> 19:14.190
Then marry him.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.030
-OK. Although--
-Stop it.

19:21.110 --> 19:24.370
- OK.
- All right.

19:24.450 --> 19:27.330
We have work to do.
Our venue is not exactly ideal.

19:27.410 --> 19:29.960
We need some festive, cheery things.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.830
Mal, you take charge.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.380
-Why her?
-I said "cheery."

19:33.460 --> 19:35.290
And you would find things
that look like scrotum.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.960
-They follow me everywhere.
-Why are you guys still standing here?

19:38.050 --> 19:39.550
-OK.
-Go. Go.

19:39.630 --> 19:43.430
And you go home and get something to wear
besides that Hawaiian shirt abomination.

19:43.510 --> 19:45.260
And I'll grab the marriage license.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.310
And we're gonna go
get someone to officiate.

19:47.390 --> 19:49.140
-We will?
-We will. Yeah.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.230
Go! Come!

19:51.600 --> 19:56.270
-I really wish I could help you.
-Well, don't wish. Do. Father.

19:56.360 --> 19:58.530
I can't. I'm a Catholic priest.

19:58.610 --> 20:01.070
I just can't join two men
in holy matrimony.

20:01.150 --> 20:03.780
There's no, like, leeway?
Even with this new pope?

20:03.870 --> 20:05.370
-Yeah.
-I mean, he really seems

20:05.450 --> 20:07.040
to be shaking shit up.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.160
Oh, Christ.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.590
We have to leave and change our names
and numbers and get out of town.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.250
-Like, forever.
-I have children.

20:18.340 --> 20:20.010
-Well, I have a dog.
-I have nothing.

20:20.090 --> 20:22.220
I have a major urge to drink cough syrup.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.470
OK, can we just do the job
we were assigned?

20:24.550 --> 20:26.050
Happy wedding decorations.

20:26.140 --> 20:28.600
-OK, Fatty.
-OK, would you stop?

20:28.680 --> 20:30.310
I'm not fat.

20:31.350 --> 20:32.640
I'm pregnant.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.780
- With twins.
- Whoa!

20:38.860 --> 20:40.530
-Nice!
-Congratulations!

20:40.610 --> 20:42.400
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Great! Amazing!

20:42.490 --> 20:45.360
- Yeah.
- Mal, are you crazy?

20:45.450 --> 20:48.120
You already have two kids.
That's like four kids.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.750
Yeah. OK, you guys,
can you please not say anything?

20:51.830 --> 20:53.120
- Not with everything going on.
- Yeah.

20:53.210 --> 20:54.210
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:54.290 --> 20:55.750
-OK.
-Yeah, of course.

20:56.540 --> 21:00.050
-I can hardly get my arms around you.
-Oh. So loving.

21:00.130 --> 21:02.130
Sorry. I got excited.
I thought you might be fat.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.760
-Do you have any issues marrying two men?
-No. Of course not.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.430
I am in complete support of gay marriage.

21:08.510 --> 21:09.970
Thank you, Rabbi.

21:10.060 --> 21:13.980
Now let's fill out some of this form
so as not to have your loved one

21:14.060 --> 21:15.940
worry about anything but healing.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.190
And who are these two men?

21:18.270 --> 21:20.480
-They're--
-No. No. Let me handle it.

21:20.570 --> 21:21.400
-OK.
-Talk to me.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.490
She likes to be in charge
of answering questions.

21:24.570 --> 21:25.700
Yeah. I do like that.

21:25.780 --> 21:27.910
Oh. OK.

21:27.990 --> 21:30.450
Uh, well, let's start with their--
their Hebrew names.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.160
-The...
-Hebrew names.

21:36.120 --> 21:41.250
- Sol's Sol Bergstein.
- His Hebrew name is...

21:41.340 --> 21:43.510
-Shlomo.
-Shlomo.

21:43.590 --> 21:47.140
-And the other gentleman?
-Uh... He's been circumcised.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.720
-I assumed. His name?
-His Hebrew name.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.520
Robert Hummel.

21:56.390 --> 21:58.350
OK. Uh...

21:58.440 --> 22:01.360
That's not a... a Hebrew name.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.480
That's not a name.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.910
-He's not Jewish, is he?
-Well, what does it matter?

22:08.990 --> 22:11.910
I mean, you said you'd marry
two men and they're both men.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.620
Let's go! Do this!

22:13.700 --> 22:17.000
I'm so sorry.
I don't do interfaith marriages.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.000
Are you fucking kidding me?

22:19.080 --> 22:21.750
Why not? You're supposed to be
so lefty and progressive.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.260
Well, ma'am, I became a rabbi

22:23.340 --> 22:25.420
-for three reasons--
-I don't care why you became a rabbi.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.550
I care about you marrying our husbands.

22:27.630 --> 22:30.720
I understand that
this is a disappointment for you and--

22:30.800 --> 22:32.220
Yes, it is a disappointment.

22:32.310 --> 22:36.310
And you know why? Because you're
being stubborn and unreasonable.

22:36.390 --> 22:39.480
And by the way, the Lord
does not like stubborn and unreasonable.

22:39.560 --> 22:42.190
-Grace, take it down.
-I understand you're having a hard time.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.740
-I am not having a hard time!
-You are yelling at a rabbi.

22:45.820 --> 22:48.530
Well, because there's a sick WASP upstairs

22:48.610 --> 22:50.820
that needs to marry the Jewish one.

22:51.740 --> 22:54.620
And it's--
it's not like I asked you to marry Jesus!

22:54.700 --> 22:57.120
God-- Grace. Grace, OK.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.710
Why is this so important to you?

22:59.790 --> 23:01.710
This man ruined your life.

23:01.790 --> 23:05.050
-Why are you so eager to get him married?
-Well, I...

23:10.470 --> 23:12.100
I don't want him to die.

23:14.350 --> 23:18.890
When he first told me about Sol,
I was so angry.

23:20.270 --> 23:21.440
I said-- Oh, God.

23:23.270 --> 23:25.400
It would have been easier if he died.

23:25.480 --> 23:27.320
-You actually said it?
-Yeah.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.700
I just thought it
and felt guilty about that.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.620
I'm scared for him, Frankie.
And there's nothing I can do.

23:32.700 --> 23:35.290
Yes, there is.
We'll find a way to do this wedding.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.700
How? I've pissed off
all the clergy people in this hospital.

23:38.790 --> 23:40.080
Well, let's think about it, then.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.630
We can find a patient who can help us.

23:42.710 --> 23:45.000
Maybe a judge who's having hernia surgery.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.460
God. Yeah, that'll be easy to find.

23:47.550 --> 23:51.510
OK, OK. Well, we could--
we could find someone online.

23:54.140 --> 23:56.470
And you know who? You!

23:56.560 --> 23:58.680
-What? No. No. No!
-Yeah. Not no! Yes!

23:58.770 --> 24:01.390
-You're ordained!
-No. By the Internet.

24:01.480 --> 24:04.270
I don't even know that
the Universal Life Church is a real thing.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.400
-It could be a cult.
-You married your cousin Donald, right?

24:07.480 --> 24:10.280
To his kidney donor.
That was real. Come on, Frankie!

24:10.360 --> 24:11.650
Oh, no. Stop.

24:11.740 --> 24:13.410
I don't even
want to go to their wedding.

24:13.490 --> 24:17.290
-Why would I want to perform it?
-Because you're the last option.

24:18.660 --> 24:20.960
Grace,
I can't even look Robert in the eye.

24:21.040 --> 24:22.290
So look at Sol!

24:22.370 --> 24:24.540
He's the whole reason
I don't want to do it.

24:24.630 --> 24:27.710
-I was at his last wedding.
-Yeah. OK. OK. OK.

24:29.300 --> 24:34.510
Think about this. Maybe, just maybe,
by giving this to Robert,

24:34.590 --> 24:36.930
you're gonna be making up
for some of the wrong you did him.

24:37.010 --> 24:41.770
And maybe... that'll help you
get some of your power back.

24:41.850 --> 24:43.730
And it'll help you move forward.

24:48.110 --> 24:49.070
OK.

24:50.440 --> 24:53.030
-I taught you well, Grace Hanson.
-Right?

24:53.110 --> 24:54.740
Yeah, I did. I did.

24:56.570 --> 24:58.030
-That's good.
-Thank you.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.160
Oh.

25:01.250 --> 25:02.830
A bouquet that doubles as hors d'oeuvres.

25:02.910 --> 25:04.420
- Nice.
- I'm here. I'm here.

25:04.500 --> 25:05.750
I don't have the right incense,

25:05.830 --> 25:08.130
but I can't light a match
around the oxygen anyway.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.260
-Robert wants to see you.
-Me?

25:14.340 --> 25:16.510
-Yes. You, Grace.
-Oh.

25:22.140 --> 25:23.980
You OK?

25:25.850 --> 25:28.230
-How are you?
-Honestly?

25:28.980 --> 25:31.480
-I'm scared.
-Yeah, I know.

25:31.570 --> 25:33.450
Grace, if something should happen to me--

25:33.530 --> 25:35.740
No. No. Nothing's gonna happen to you.

25:35.820 --> 25:38.570
We don't know that. And there are
a few things we should talk about.

25:38.660 --> 25:41.040
No. We are not having this conversation.

25:41.120 --> 25:43.000
-Excuse me?
-No, because you're not gonna die.

25:43.080 --> 25:45.750
And you know why?
Because I am not gonna let you.

25:45.830 --> 25:48.750
You are not getting off the hook
that easy, mister.

25:49.750 --> 25:52.800
First, I wasn't allowed to get angry
with you 'cause you're gay.

25:53.420 --> 25:55.720
Now I'm not allowed to 'cause you're sick.

25:55.800 --> 25:59.220
And I have 40 years of anger built up.

26:00.390 --> 26:03.640
And it would be really shitty
if you died before I get a chance

26:03.720 --> 26:06.350
to say everything
that I need to say to you.

26:09.610 --> 26:11.320
-OK. OK.
-OK?

26:11.400 --> 26:15.240
OK. Good.

26:21.030 --> 26:23.120
Last year, when-- when I said...

26:26.500 --> 26:27.460
I didn't mean it.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.170
I know that.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.580
Hello, witnesses. Beloved strangers.

27:06.660 --> 27:09.500
I'd like everyone to hum.

27:09.580 --> 27:12.040
A low hum.

27:18.380 --> 27:19.880
Now sway.

27:24.760 --> 27:30.140
We are here to join my ex-husband
with her ex-husband

27:30.230 --> 27:33.940
because they deeply
and truly love each other.

27:34.020 --> 27:37.780
And as infuriating as that is...

27:37.860 --> 27:40.070
it's surprisingly beautiful.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.410
There you are.

27:43.240 --> 27:44.200
This is nice.

27:44.910 --> 27:46.620
-It's time to go.
-Don't touch that bed!

27:47.450 --> 27:51.500
-Frankie, get moving. Speed it up.
-I've got it, just the meat.

27:51.580 --> 27:55.500
Robert, do you happily
make the decision with an open heart--

27:55.590 --> 27:57.630
Don't say "open heart."

27:58.260 --> 28:01.340
...a full heart to join your lives,

28:01.430 --> 28:03.510
to fulfill your dreams,

28:03.600 --> 28:07.600
to embrace adventures
and create memories together?

28:07.680 --> 28:09.930
I most certainly do.

28:11.140 --> 28:14.730
And do you, Sol,
happily make the decision

28:14.810 --> 28:16.770
with a full heart...

28:17.650 --> 28:21.110
to join your lives,
to fulfill your dreams,

28:21.200 --> 28:25.530
to embrace adventures
and create memories together?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.000
I do.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.420
OK then.

28:33.500 --> 28:38.380
By the power vested in me
by the magic of the world wide web,

28:38.460 --> 28:41.920
I now pronounce you... married.

28:53.980 --> 28:56.110
-Now you can go.
-Awesome.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.570
Dad.

29:21.670 --> 29:24.180
-You did good, Frankie.
-I did, didn't I?

29:24.260 --> 29:26.510
-Yeah, you were strong.
-I know.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.100
And you didn't think you could.

29:29.180 --> 29:30.180
How'd you do it?

29:30.260 --> 29:34.020
Well, I pushed my feelings down
and I built a stone wall around them.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.650
Basically, I channeled you.

29:36.730 --> 29:39.060
Well, you're welcome.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.740
- Would you channel me a martini?
- Probably can be arranged.
