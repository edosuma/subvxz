01:31.736 --> 01:34.136
Use lethal
force if necessary.

01:34.138 --> 01:34.941
Move in!

01:46.751 --> 01:48.719
- On the floor!
- It's mine!

01:48.721 --> 01:50.120
- He's got a gun!
- It chose me!

01:50.122 --> 01:52.189
- Drop your weapon, sir!
- I won't let you take it!

01:57.262 --> 01:59.732
We've got the pod.

03:34.326 --> 03:35.859
It is
another balmy Georgia night

03:35.861 --> 03:37.326
with temperatures
in the low 80s.

03:37.328 --> 03:39.596
Hopefully you're increasing
the heat personally

03:39.598 --> 03:41.198
here Augusta with
someone special.

03:41.200 --> 03:42.866
Hey, if you're by yourself,

03:42.868 --> 03:45.872
Bo Christine here sending this
one out to you on 95 Rock.

03:51.976 --> 03:53.011
She left me.

03:56.415 --> 03:58.848
Does that really surprise you?

03:58.850 --> 04:00.015
No, I guess not.

04:00.017 --> 04:02.551
Which girl are we
talking about here?

04:02.553 --> 04:05.254
Rachel or the new
girl from Reinhardts?

04:05.256 --> 04:06.092
Rachel.

04:08.059 --> 04:09.925
Because of that new
girl from Reinhardts.

04:09.927 --> 04:11.127
Amen to that, brother.

04:11.129 --> 04:14.197
Rachel never liked
me anyway, so...

04:14.199 --> 04:15.031
Good riddance.

04:15.033 --> 04:16.966
Aw, that's not true.

04:16.969 --> 04:18.067
She liked you a lot, bro.

04:18.070 --> 04:20.870
Please, please!

04:20.872 --> 04:22.504
She was always bothered by me.

04:22.506 --> 04:25.040
Everyone's bothered
by you, Marcus.

04:25.042 --> 04:26.276
We just tolerate you.

04:26.278 --> 04:27.276
Did you know that?

04:27.278 --> 04:29.045
Well, I know now.

04:29.047 --> 04:31.247
I mean, at least I get
a free beer out of it.

04:31.249 --> 04:34.050
But you know what, you gotta
stop being so damn cheap

04:34.052 --> 04:37.420
and get us some real beer
instead of this piss-water.

04:37.422 --> 04:38.420
I'm on a budget.

04:38.422 --> 04:40.055
What's it like
having your wife

04:40.057 --> 04:41.223
wear the pants of the family?

04:41.225 --> 04:42.928
I don't see you
workin' neither.

04:43.929 --> 04:45.127
I'm self-employed!

04:45.129 --> 04:47.930
Just another word
for unemployed.

04:47.932 --> 04:49.432
Shit.

04:49.434 --> 04:51.100
What are you laughing at?

04:51.102 --> 04:53.502
Last decent job you had
was cracking the skulls

04:53.504 --> 04:56.038
of horny lowlifes
at Crazy Eight's.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.007
Will and I had a good
laugh about that one.

04:58.009 --> 04:59.442
Speaking of which,

04:59.444 --> 05:00.576
you have any thoughts or plans

05:00.578 --> 05:02.177
on what you gonna do with 'em?

05:02.179 --> 05:03.913
We already had
this conversation.

05:03.915 --> 05:05.014
We're not having it again.

05:05.016 --> 05:06.682
I'm just concerned,
that's all.

05:06.684 --> 05:07.783
I know you're concerned.

05:07.785 --> 05:11.021
You've made that very
clear, over and over again.

05:11.023 --> 05:12.689
Look, all I'm saying
is the current situation

05:12.691 --> 05:13.990
might be making it worse.

05:13.992 --> 05:16.959
Mopin' and paintin' all day.

05:16.961 --> 05:19.129
Maybe he might benefit from
going to see a therapist.

05:19.131 --> 05:21.163
There you go again, Marcus!

05:21.165 --> 05:23.168
We're done talking
about it, okay?

05:49.093 --> 05:49.928
Terry!

05:51.429 --> 05:52.264
Teresa!

05:53.999 --> 05:55.598
Hey, what's up?

05:55.600 --> 05:57.100
I just...

05:57.102 --> 05:57.937
Oh.

05:59.037 --> 06:01.103
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

06:01.105 --> 06:03.473
I just
dropped the bottle.

06:03.475 --> 06:05.675
Yeah you did.

06:05.677 --> 06:08.077
You're burning the
midnight oil tonight.

06:08.079 --> 06:09.312
Did I wake you?

06:09.314 --> 06:12.148
Uh, no, I just
got home from work

06:12.150 --> 06:13.249
about a half hour ago.

06:13.251 --> 06:14.184
Late shift, huh?

06:14.186 --> 06:15.718
Tonight was my last night.

06:15.720 --> 06:18.754
Her regular caregiver is back
from vacation tomorrow morning

06:18.756 --> 06:21.156
so I have a bit of a break

06:21.158 --> 06:23.425
before I go back to
my regular shift.

06:23.427 --> 06:25.528
I'm sure the overtime
doesn't hurt either, right?

06:25.530 --> 06:28.430
No, thank God for that.

06:28.432 --> 06:30.235
Hey, get out!

06:35.674 --> 06:37.173
Look, I'm sorry to
bother you anyway.

06:37.175 --> 06:38.374
It's totally fine.

06:38.376 --> 06:41.043
I was reading, it's
not a big deal.

06:41.045 --> 06:43.648
Besides, I can't really
sleep until Brent gets home.

06:45.716 --> 06:47.716
Especially when he's
out with the boys.

06:47.718 --> 06:49.151
Yeah.

06:49.153 --> 06:51.286
He's been doing
that a lot lately.

06:51.288 --> 06:53.024
Yeah, he's got
a lot on his mind.

06:55.192 --> 06:57.560
Hey, you got a picture
of this new girl?

06:57.562 --> 06:58.694
I don't think I know her.

06:58.696 --> 06:59.665
Course you do.

07:00.631 --> 07:03.199
It's the redhead from
last Tuesday night.

07:03.201 --> 07:04.399
Man, that's too steep.

07:04.401 --> 07:08.103
I'll show you a picture,
trust me, you'll remember her.

07:08.105 --> 07:09.805
Timeline, hold on a sec.

07:09.807 --> 07:11.444
Signal's for shit out here.

07:18.050 --> 07:19.518
I got zero service.

07:20.549 --> 07:23.218
Your cellphone carrier's
just like Brent's beer.

07:23.220 --> 07:24.223
- Cheap.
- Hey!

07:32.064 --> 07:33.196
Good Lord!

07:33.198 --> 07:34.230
What the hell?

07:34.232 --> 07:35.167
Was that a plane?

07:36.367 --> 07:38.103
That's too small for a plane.

07:43.175 --> 07:45.208
Let's go, let's go!

07:45.210 --> 07:46.645
Hey, cooler, cooler!

08:25.650 --> 08:28.120
I told you it wasn't a plane.

08:32.389 --> 08:34.289
Either of you
getting any service?

08:34.292 --> 08:35.457
We should call the
police, shouldn't we?

08:35.460 --> 08:36.592
Don't worry about it.

08:36.594 --> 08:38.429
What the hell is it?

08:42.765 --> 08:44.366
Can you
feel that heat?

08:44.368 --> 08:45.203
Oh yeah.

08:47.271 --> 08:48.571
Grab the cooler.

08:48.573 --> 08:49.475
We'll ice it down.

09:05.924 --> 09:07.222
You better stand back.

09:07.224 --> 09:08.524
No problem.

09:08.526 --> 09:09.792
On three.

09:09.794 --> 09:12.098
One, two, three.

09:23.175 --> 09:25.243
What the hell was that?

09:29.414 --> 09:30.482
Is it a satellite?

09:37.255 --> 09:40.423
Since we're both awake,
do you want a rematch?

09:40.425 --> 09:42.424
So you can win back those Oreos

09:42.426 --> 09:46.262
you so poorly,
embarrassingly lost to me?

09:46.264 --> 09:48.431
That was pathetic.

09:48.433 --> 09:51.201
No, I'm just gonna stay up.

09:51.203 --> 09:52.634
I'm gonna finish this I think.

09:52.636 --> 09:54.140
What are you working on?

09:57.943 --> 09:59.341
I thought it'd be nice to
paint her younger, you know?

09:59.343 --> 10:00.879
Thought Jess would like that.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.715
Maybe I could give it to
her in person, you know?

10:05.717 --> 10:08.283
Do you know what
Jess would really like,

10:08.285 --> 10:10.155
- well, is...
- What, Terry, what?

10:11.356 --> 10:13.722
What would she like?

10:16.527 --> 10:20.263
- Over there.
- Is everything okay?

10:20.265 --> 10:22.631
Hey, hey, hey,
what are you doing?

10:22.633 --> 10:23.732
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

10:23.734 --> 10:24.933
What are you guys doing?

10:24.935 --> 10:25.969
We need a table,
bro, we need a table.

10:25.971 --> 10:27.570
Yo, yo, yo, come on!

10:27.572 --> 10:28.638
What is going on?

10:28.640 --> 10:29.871
You guys are scaring me.

10:29.873 --> 10:31.240
You might want to
grab your inhaler.

10:31.242 --> 10:32.741
Why do I need my inhaler?

10:32.743 --> 10:34.612
We brought you back
a little something.

11:15.587 --> 11:18.321
- This had better be good.
- We might have another...

11:18.323 --> 11:18.958
Ow!

11:24.462 --> 11:25.794
What?

11:25.796 --> 11:27.800
I said we
might have another one.

11:29.733 --> 11:30.636
What, this soon?

11:31.736 --> 11:32.871
Tell me you're joking.

11:34.039 --> 11:35.404
When have
you ever known me

11:35.406 --> 11:36.675
to have a sense of humor?

11:38.676 --> 11:40.475
Where?

11:40.477 --> 11:41.280
Augusta, Georgia.

11:42.747 --> 11:44.480
Atlanta has already sent a
team to lock down the site

11:44.482 --> 11:45.884
and set up a field office.

11:48.019 --> 11:51.387
All right.

11:51.389 --> 11:52.358
Give me a half hour.

12:00.765 --> 12:03.533
So wait, you didn't
call the police?

12:03.535 --> 12:06.068
We couldn't get a signal.

12:06.070 --> 12:08.337
No one's calling the police.

12:08.339 --> 12:09.339
Okay, but what if it's a...

12:09.341 --> 12:10.639
What if it's what?

12:10.641 --> 12:12.708
A satellite, a
piece of a rocket,

12:12.710 --> 12:14.844
a piece of the
International Space Station?

12:14.846 --> 12:17.879
It's definitely none of those
things, I can tell you that.

12:17.881 --> 12:19.514
How do you know?

12:19.516 --> 12:21.384
I watch the Discovery
Channel, Terry!

12:21.386 --> 12:22.684
Religiously.

12:22.686 --> 12:24.553
We should still try
and figure it out,

12:24.555 --> 12:27.856
I mean, there's a chance it
could be dangerous, right?

12:27.858 --> 12:29.524
Will could be right.

12:29.526 --> 12:32.297
What if there's some
kind of disease on there,

12:33.365 --> 12:34.800
radiation or something?

12:36.800 --> 12:39.501
Well if that's the case,
we're already screwed.

12:39.503 --> 12:40.836
We're already screwed?

12:40.838 --> 12:42.038
I didn't wash my hands.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.573
Did you guys wash your hands
after you touched it, or...

12:44.575 --> 12:46.377
No, I didn't...

12:48.545 --> 12:51.447
John, he's messing
with you, just relax.

12:52.684 --> 12:54.420
You're a douchebag.

12:56.453 --> 12:57.720
You know, we did
find it though,

12:57.722 --> 12:59.788
so there's gotta be
something to that.

12:59.790 --> 13:01.490
You mean like money?

13:01.492 --> 13:02.493
Maybe.

13:03.627 --> 13:08.563
So before we do anything
stupid, like calling the cops,

13:08.565 --> 13:09.934
we need to figure this all out.

13:11.136 --> 13:11.969
Are we agreed?

13:13.103 --> 13:14.405
Yeah, sure.

13:15.406 --> 13:16.441
John?

13:17.909 --> 13:21.411
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

13:21.413 --> 13:22.948
So what do we do?

13:24.549 --> 13:27.682
You know, maybe we
should all get some sleep.

13:27.684 --> 13:29.985
You guys want to go home,
or you want to crash here?

13:29.987 --> 13:31.421
I'd rather stay.

13:31.423 --> 13:34.590
You know, protect
our investment.

13:34.592 --> 13:37.493
It's a good point,
me too, I guess.

13:37.495 --> 13:39.995
Okay, well, Terry will set
you up in the living room.

13:39.997 --> 13:41.563
Are you guys serious?

13:41.565 --> 13:42.965
How are you gonna
be able to sleep?

13:42.967 --> 13:46.601
I mean there's a whatever-this-is
sitting right here.

13:46.603 --> 13:47.970
I guess you've got
first watch, then.

13:47.972 --> 13:49.438
Okay.

13:49.440 --> 13:52.207
No, it's cool, bro,
I'll take first watch.

13:52.209 --> 13:53.609
No, it's cool, I got it.

13:53.611 --> 13:55.043
No, seriously, I got it.

13:55.045 --> 13:57.547
Matter of fact, why
don't you take the couch?

13:57.549 --> 13:58.815
I already said I wasn't tired.

13:58.817 --> 14:00.482
I said it's cool.

14:00.484 --> 14:02.618
It's not cool, okay?

14:02.620 --> 14:04.519
Why don't you tell us
what you really think?

14:04.521 --> 14:06.624
- Marcus...
- No, no, no.

14:07.692 --> 14:09.458
Will can take it.

14:09.460 --> 14:11.626
- Ain't you, Will?
- Yeah.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.229
Okay, let's see, um...

14:13.231 --> 14:16.164
Maybe it's the fact that you
live in your sister's garage,

14:16.166 --> 14:18.467
painting pictures all damn day.

14:18.469 --> 14:20.870
You see, this the shit I've
been talking about, man.

14:20.872 --> 14:23.409
When was the last time this
dude had a decent rest?

14:24.575 --> 14:25.707
Wish I could get
up out of this chair

14:25.709 --> 14:27.078
and punch you in the mouth.

14:28.646 --> 14:31.949
You know, brother,
hand in my heart,

14:34.651 --> 14:35.720
I would love to see that.

14:37.588 --> 14:39.491
Okay, it's settled!

14:40.525 --> 14:41.760
Will gets first watch.

14:45.663 --> 14:46.965
Yeah, it's fine.

14:52.871 --> 14:55.941
- Goodnight, Will.
- Goodnight, John.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.019
Healing takes time, Will.

15:14.224 --> 15:15.758
Lights on or off?

15:15.760 --> 15:16.562
Off.

17:15.913 --> 17:20.919
Oh shit.

17:47.377 --> 17:52.384
God damn.

17:57.954 --> 17:58.790
Oh shit!

18:16.339 --> 18:17.242
No, no, no!

18:52.743 --> 18:54.943
I can't stay Will!

18:54.945 --> 18:56.878
- Let me go!
- Please don't leave me!

18:56.880 --> 18:58.015
Will, I can't!

19:06.290 --> 19:07.125
Help me!

19:52.036 --> 19:52.871
Will!

19:58.876 --> 20:00.511
Get him out of here!

20:07.952 --> 20:09.285
What are you doing,
what are you doing?

20:09.287 --> 20:11.519
You have to take me
back in there now!

20:11.521 --> 20:12.988
Do you think we should
take him to a doctor?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.990
And say what, he was
attacked by an alien?

20:14.992 --> 20:15.990
It didn't attack me!

20:15.992 --> 20:16.959
Well that's not what
it looked like to me.

20:16.961 --> 20:18.527
It didn't attack me,
you have to listen!

20:18.529 --> 20:20.229
Look, that's what
I call an attack!

20:20.231 --> 20:22.964
- Listen to me!
- Hey guys, come on fellas!

20:22.966 --> 20:23.833
- Break it up!
- Chill out!

20:23.835 --> 20:25.366
Listen to me, I
can feel my legs!

20:25.368 --> 20:27.869
Will, Will, let me go!

20:27.871 --> 20:29.104
Terry might be right.

20:29.106 --> 20:30.038
Ain't no telling what that thing

20:30.040 --> 20:31.207
could have done to him in there.

20:31.209 --> 20:33.378
It didn't do anything
to me, all right?

20:34.412 --> 20:35.877
Were you guys not in that room,

20:35.879 --> 20:37.346
did you not see
what just happened?

20:37.348 --> 20:38.314
Huh?

20:38.316 --> 20:41.016
Brent, I can feel my legs.

20:41.018 --> 20:42.984
I can feel it, okay?

20:42.986 --> 20:43.620
I can stand.

20:45.489 --> 20:46.555
Take me back in there, please.

20:46.557 --> 20:48.089
No.

20:48.091 --> 20:49.357
Just take me back in for
one more moment please.

20:49.359 --> 20:50.392
No.

20:50.394 --> 20:52.060
I'm fine, okay.

20:52.062 --> 20:54.128
Until a baby alien pops
out the back of your neck

20:54.130 --> 20:55.865
and tries to eat us!

20:55.867 --> 20:57.333
Marcus, anyone ever tell
you that you stick your nose

20:57.335 --> 20:59.034
into a lot of places
it don't belong?

20:59.036 --> 21:00.501
Many of times.

21:00.503 --> 21:01.470
But this doesn't
change the fact that

21:01.472 --> 21:02.872
that thing could be in there

21:02.874 --> 21:04.138
doing some body
snatching shit on you.

21:04.140 --> 21:05.406
Oh come on.

21:05.408 --> 21:07.009
I mean, how do we know
that Will is even real?

21:07.011 --> 21:08.009
He could be
pretending to be Will

21:08.011 --> 21:09.444
so he can take us over.

21:09.446 --> 21:11.212
You're not seriously listening
to this bullshit, are you?

21:11.214 --> 21:13.082
That's probably what
an alien would say!

21:13.084 --> 21:14.349
That's exactly what
an alien would say!

21:14.351 --> 21:16.085
No one asked you John!

21:16.087 --> 21:17.385
Will you all calm down?

21:17.387 --> 21:18.319
Hey man, I'm just saying...

21:18.321 --> 21:19.587
I said shut the hell up!

21:19.589 --> 21:20.425
I can't think!

21:26.998 --> 21:30.365
Marcus, if I am an alien,
I'm gonna eat you first.

21:30.367 --> 21:31.203
You hear that?

21:39.277 --> 21:41.009
- John, John.
- What?

21:41.011 --> 21:44.413
Is there someone from
Payne College we can talk to?

21:44.415 --> 21:45.413
What, what do you mean?

21:45.415 --> 21:46.915
Like one of your teachers?

21:46.917 --> 21:48.084
Dude, I'm taking
auto shop classes.

21:48.086 --> 21:50.085
What the hell would those
guys know about any of this?

21:50.087 --> 21:51.653
Yeah, but there's
gotta be other teachers.

21:51.655 --> 21:55.156
They teach a lot of
science stuff there, yeah?

21:55.158 --> 21:56.959
Yeah, I dunno, yeah, I guess!

21:56.961 --> 21:58.059
Think, there's
gotta be someone!

21:58.061 --> 21:59.929
I thought you said you
didn't want to tell anybody

21:59.931 --> 22:01.430
about any of this until we
got this all figured out!

22:01.432 --> 22:03.332
Well, the situation's
kind of changed, hasn't it?

22:03.334 --> 22:05.366
Hey, hey, didn't you
take some astrology class

22:05.368 --> 22:07.036
a few years ago
when you was trying

22:07.038 --> 22:09.404
to be an astronaut or some
stupid shit like that?

22:09.406 --> 22:11.640
No, it was an astronomy class.

22:11.642 --> 22:13.241
I never said I wanted
to be an astronaut.

22:13.243 --> 22:14.710
Yeah, right!

22:14.712 --> 22:16.077
Look, if it's anyone,
it's my old biology teacher

22:16.079 --> 22:17.313
we should be talking to.

22:17.315 --> 22:19.048
Okay, whatever,
what's his name?

22:19.050 --> 22:20.348
Um...

22:20.350 --> 22:22.250
It was only a few
years ago, John!

22:22.252 --> 22:23.184
I know, I know, hold on!

22:23.186 --> 22:24.420
Well what's his name, dumbass?

22:24.422 --> 22:25.421
Jesus Christ, give
me a second to think!

22:25.423 --> 22:27.455
Hey hey hey!

22:27.457 --> 22:29.159
Chill out with the
blasphemy, bro.

22:33.731 --> 22:35.230
- Westlake.
- What?

22:35.232 --> 22:37.432
Westlake, it was
Professor Westlake.

22:37.434 --> 22:38.267
Are you sure?

22:38.269 --> 22:39.535
Yeah, I'm sure.

22:39.537 --> 22:40.602
I mean, but who knows if
he's still there or not?

22:40.604 --> 22:42.136
Yeah, he is.

22:42.138 --> 22:44.038
Do you need his cell
phone, email address?

22:44.040 --> 22:45.074
Text it to me.

22:45.076 --> 22:45.708
Let's go.

22:45.710 --> 22:46.709
Wait, no, now?

22:46.711 --> 22:48.376
No, I don't think that's
such a good idea, Brent.

22:48.378 --> 22:49.644
And why not?

22:49.646 --> 22:52.580
For one, he failed me.

22:52.582 --> 22:55.683
And for two, what
are we gonna do here?

22:55.685 --> 23:00.055
No offense, but I don't
particularly feel safe

23:00.057 --> 23:02.559
being alone with um, him.

23:04.995 --> 23:06.030
Okay.

23:07.164 --> 23:08.396
You're going back to the field.

23:08.398 --> 23:09.664
And why would I do that?

23:09.666 --> 23:11.202
To see if we missed anything.

23:13.370 --> 23:14.405
That's a good idea.

23:17.174 --> 23:18.009
Go, go.

23:19.309 --> 23:21.143
I'm staying with Will.

23:21.145 --> 23:22.176
Are you okay with that?

23:22.178 --> 23:23.112
Yeah.

23:23.114 --> 23:24.249
I promise I won't eat her.

23:25.249 --> 23:27.115
Yeah, right.

23:27.117 --> 23:29.287
I'll be fine,
okay, I'll be fine.

23:31.789 --> 23:33.157
A gun, really?

23:34.325 --> 23:35.624
Just stay out of
the garage for now.

23:35.626 --> 23:37.192
I hope that's not for me.

23:37.194 --> 23:38.296
You would do the same.

23:39.629 --> 23:40.461
No I wouldn't.

23:40.463 --> 23:41.366
I won't be long.

23:44.034 --> 23:45.666
And you...

23:45.668 --> 23:47.104
Stay out of the garage.

23:48.271 --> 23:50.372
Next time
I got first watch.

23:50.374 --> 23:51.707
This dude's taking
about eating people...

23:51.709 --> 23:54.143
- Shut up Marcus!
- Shut up!

24:36.553 --> 24:38.720
Hello,
Professor Westlake?

24:38.722 --> 24:40.325
Come in, in here.

24:44.328 --> 24:46.561
Did we have an appointment?

24:46.563 --> 24:47.765
There wasn't any time.

24:51.301 --> 24:52.136
Now...

24:53.236 --> 24:54.638
What can I do for you?

24:58.175 --> 25:00.578
We need to talk to you
about a private matter.

25:01.511 --> 25:03.181
Are you students of mine?

25:04.147 --> 25:06.414
He used to be your student.

25:06.416 --> 25:08.252
Yeah, it was a few years ago.

25:09.220 --> 25:10.454
I wasn't here very much.

25:12.388 --> 25:14.222
Well, what do you want, then?

25:14.224 --> 25:15.459
What private matter?

25:16.726 --> 25:19.363
Oh, I do remember you.

25:21.197 --> 25:22.263
Brandt.

25:22.265 --> 25:23.699
Johnathan Brandt, right?

25:23.701 --> 25:25.901
Unfortunately, yeah.

25:25.903 --> 25:27.135
You know, I only failed you

25:27.137 --> 25:29.337
because you were
constantly absent.

25:29.339 --> 25:31.339
You actually showed
some promise.

25:31.341 --> 25:34.111
I just don't think I
was cut out for biology.

25:35.279 --> 25:38.547
I assume you went on
to grander things, then?

25:38.549 --> 25:43.484
Well...

25:43.486 --> 25:44.288
So.

25:45.188 --> 25:46.855
Why are we here?

25:46.857 --> 25:49.490
We're here because
we found something.

25:49.492 --> 25:52.730
We found it in a field
not far from here.

25:53.664 --> 25:55.200
Something otherworldly.

25:56.934 --> 25:57.769
Huh.

26:17.855 --> 26:20.191
I thought you guys
were all done by now.

26:21.357 --> 26:22.557
Done?

26:22.559 --> 26:23.759
Aren't you with
those government folk

26:23.761 --> 26:25.193
who were messin' my property?

26:25.195 --> 26:26.662
Well, I was actually coming

26:26.664 --> 26:30.399
to ask permission to look at
your field, the one back there.

26:30.401 --> 26:32.800
So government people came
to look at your field?

26:32.802 --> 26:34.836
Out here this morning
with their damn trucks

26:34.838 --> 26:36.270
making a whole racket.

26:36.272 --> 26:38.240
Digging up the place
and testing the soil.

26:38.242 --> 26:39.807
Only left about an hour ago.

26:39.809 --> 26:41.777
Thought you were one of
them back to annoy me

26:41.779 --> 26:43.211
or to dig up my field again.

26:43.213 --> 26:45.649
Can we just go look
at your field, please?

26:54.857 --> 26:56.895
I coulda sworn
it was right here.

27:08.405 --> 27:10.638
You know those
things will kill you.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.475
Yup.

27:19.582 --> 27:23.251
Big boy's awful interested
in that field, isn't he?

27:23.253 --> 27:24.355
Could be a farmhand.

27:26.322 --> 27:28.856
My gut says go with
the peanut farmer.

27:28.858 --> 27:30.328
My gut says...

27:32.963 --> 27:34.365
Save me some of those fries.

27:36.634 --> 27:39.034
That's a pretty wild story.

27:39.036 --> 27:40.902
Well, that's the
way it all happened.

27:40.904 --> 27:42.570
I would need to see it.

27:42.572 --> 27:43.872
We figured that.

27:43.874 --> 27:45.973
Could you come with us now?

27:45.975 --> 27:47.776
No, that's impossible.

27:47.778 --> 27:49.780
I have classes
until this evening.

27:51.415 --> 27:52.282
Well, tonight then?

27:53.550 --> 27:55.017
I...

27:55.019 --> 27:56.221
Please.

27:57.288 --> 27:58.856
All right then, all right.

28:07.298 --> 28:08.465
My address and cell.

28:10.667 --> 28:11.501
Okay.

28:15.705 --> 28:19.674
You wouldn't be making fun
of an old man, now would you?

28:19.676 --> 28:20.978
Text before you come.

28:29.386 --> 28:31.653
Are you sure you don't
want something to eat?

28:31.655 --> 28:32.456
No thank you.

28:34.692 --> 28:36.394
You really should
eat something.

28:37.328 --> 28:38.794
Can you just get
my wheelchair please?

28:38.796 --> 28:41.462
Brent said that we should
stay out of the garage.

28:41.464 --> 28:43.367
Always do everything
he tells you to do?

28:46.669 --> 28:48.372
I'm sorry, I just...

28:50.374 --> 28:51.605
I want my chair,

28:51.607 --> 28:52.973
I don't want to be on
the couch anymore, okay?

28:52.975 --> 28:55.977
I am sure that he
will be back soon.

28:55.979 --> 28:58.413
It's not gonna
hurt you Terry, okay?

28:58.415 --> 29:01.415
Just let me go back
in there for a second.

29:01.417 --> 29:03.684
I really don't think that
that's a good idea, Will.

29:03.686 --> 29:05.354
Why?

29:05.356 --> 29:05.990
Why?

29:07.357 --> 29:08.522
Just let me go back in there.

29:08.524 --> 29:09.524
Let me just see it for a second.

29:09.526 --> 29:11.425
It's probably frightened.

29:11.427 --> 29:12.062
Will.

29:14.464 --> 29:16.397
Please don't make
this difficult.

29:16.399 --> 29:17.766
I'm not making it difficult...

29:17.768 --> 29:20.434
You are making it difficult.

29:20.436 --> 29:21.836
Then just go in there
and get the chair.

29:21.838 --> 29:22.903
It'll take five seconds.

29:22.905 --> 29:24.138
Why don't you understand...

29:24.140 --> 29:25.509
I just don't want
to do the wrong thing.

29:26.777 --> 29:27.812
God damn it!

29:31.781 --> 29:32.617
I'm sorry.

29:35.018 --> 29:36.117
I'm sorry, Terry.

29:36.119 --> 29:36.953
It's okay.

29:42.459 --> 29:44.529
Hey, do you think I could
get some fresh clothes?

29:45.529 --> 29:46.761
I've been wearing these for days

29:46.763 --> 29:48.398
and I'm all sweaty,
I'm starting to stink.

29:49.566 --> 29:51.432
It's just driving me crazy.

29:51.434 --> 29:54.803
Okay, you want me
to draw you a bath?

29:54.805 --> 29:56.570
Yeah, you know what,
that sounds great.

29:56.572 --> 29:57.806
Okay.

29:57.808 --> 30:00.509
Yeah, I'm gonna need
your help with the...

30:00.511 --> 30:01.779
Yeah, of course.

30:48.759 --> 30:50.157
Hey, what's up sweetie?

30:50.159 --> 30:51.159
Hey Terry.

30:51.161 --> 30:54.962
Look, I'm sorry to bug
you again about this,

30:54.964 --> 30:57.031
but I got another notice.

30:57.033 --> 31:02.005
Oh, the bill for
the physical therapy.

31:03.072 --> 31:04.806
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

31:04.808 --> 31:06.575
I spaced on that.

31:06.577 --> 31:09.544
I promise I'll take
care of that right away.

31:09.546 --> 31:11.480
Honey, are you okay?

31:11.482 --> 31:12.950
You don't sound like yourself.

31:13.817 --> 31:15.616
You want to go grab a coffee?

31:15.618 --> 31:18.487
I could probably break from
this place in about an hour.

31:18.489 --> 31:22.624
It's not a good day, really.

31:22.626 --> 31:24.025
I can't leave the house.

31:25.928 --> 31:27.561
Can you hang on a sec?

31:27.563 --> 31:28.598
Yeah, of course.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.032
Is everything all right?

31:32.034 --> 31:32.867
Terry?

31:32.869 --> 31:33.703
Will?

31:35.739 --> 31:37.008
No, I gotta go!

31:38.207 --> 31:39.673
Will, Will!

31:39.675 --> 31:40.511
No, Will!

31:41.511 --> 31:42.914
Will, open the door!

31:44.013 --> 31:45.946
Will, open the door!

31:45.948 --> 31:48.616
Will, please open this door!

31:48.618 --> 31:50.551
Open the door please!

31:50.553 --> 31:52.589
Will, please open the door!

31:53.690 --> 31:55.493
Please open this door!

32:09.572 --> 32:12.540
So you're telling me you've
never seen this man before?

32:12.542 --> 32:13.674
Ever?

32:13.676 --> 32:14.675
You have no idea who he is,

32:14.677 --> 32:16.845
you have no idea why he
came out to your farm?

32:16.847 --> 32:19.146
You have no idea why he
was asking you questions?

32:19.148 --> 32:22.616
I told you, I don't know who
he was or why he was there!

32:22.618 --> 32:25.686
Mr. Cobb, you actually
expect me to believe

32:25.688 --> 32:27.689
that you didn't find it odd
that a perfect stranger...

32:27.691 --> 32:29.723
If it comes to
it, I've got authorization

32:29.725 --> 32:32.594
for a full tactical strike, I'm
talking ashes on the ground.

32:32.596 --> 32:33.631
I understand.

32:35.132 --> 32:37.535
Just keep me posted.

32:41.605 --> 32:43.971
To tell you the truth,
I find it more odd

32:43.973 --> 32:46.674
that that hole
wasn't there anymore.

32:46.676 --> 32:50.744
Maybe it's you who should tell
me what the hell is going on!

32:51.748 --> 32:52.650
What was that?

32:54.784 --> 32:56.317
Would you excuse
me for a second?

32:56.319 --> 32:57.221
I'll be right back.

33:04.060 --> 33:05.093
What?

33:05.095 --> 33:06.661
This guy knows crap.

33:06.663 --> 33:07.596
Well, obviously.

33:07.598 --> 33:09.698
Then why are you wasting time?

33:09.700 --> 33:11.068
What got up your ass?

33:14.370 --> 33:16.605
Just heard from
the guys in the lab.

33:16.607 --> 33:17.905
Things are getting pretty weird

33:17.907 --> 33:20.075
with our new friend
from Briar's Bluff.

33:20.077 --> 33:21.843
Like shit-your-pants weird.

33:21.845 --> 33:22.844
What does that even mean?

33:22.846 --> 33:24.645
Means we need to contain this.

33:24.647 --> 33:26.714
We are gonna need more
firepower than a SWAT team

33:26.716 --> 33:28.251
to save our asses this time.

33:31.187 --> 33:32.155
You all right?

33:34.625 --> 33:35.660
All right.

33:36.827 --> 33:38.596
What do we got on
the mystery gang?

33:39.896 --> 33:41.665
We have an address.

33:48.704 --> 33:51.205
We got a lot more than that.

33:51.207 --> 33:54.009
It always creeps me out
when you smile like that.

33:54.011 --> 33:54.845
Should.

34:04.721 --> 34:05.756
Hey.

34:07.758 --> 34:08.992
Hey, it's okay.

34:10.027 --> 34:11.125
I'm sorry.

34:11.127 --> 34:12.793
It's all right.

34:12.795 --> 34:14.763
Okay, it's all right.

34:14.764 --> 34:15.399
It's okay.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.603
This is not your fault, okay?

34:39.255 --> 34:43.661
I know you're scared, but
you don't have to be, okay?

34:44.860 --> 34:47.764
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

34:54.370 --> 34:55.770
It's not gonna hurt you.

34:55.772 --> 34:57.375
Not gonna hurt you.

34:59.242 --> 35:00.111
I promise, Terry.

35:03.814 --> 35:07.848
I promise it won't hurt you.

35:07.850 --> 35:08.685
Okay.

35:29.939 --> 35:31.305
You're such a disappointment!

35:31.307 --> 35:33.341
You see what you
make me do, see?

35:35.979 --> 35:36.814
Terry?

35:37.847 --> 35:42.049
Terry, where are you?

36:08.178 --> 36:09.013
Terry?

36:10.280 --> 36:12.482
What the hell is going on?

36:15.417 --> 36:16.250
What did you do?

36:16.252 --> 36:17.185
Brent, it's okay.

36:17.187 --> 36:18.419
- It's not okay!
- It's okay!

36:18.421 --> 36:19.854
I told you to
stay out of here.

36:19.856 --> 36:20.721
You don't need to
worry about anything...

36:20.723 --> 36:21.455
- That thing was touching you!
- Yeah.

36:21.457 --> 36:23.258
- What did it do to you?
- Relax.

36:23.260 --> 36:25.225
- What did it do to you?
- It didn't do anything.

36:25.227 --> 36:26.928
- What did you do to my wife?
- Nothing.

36:26.930 --> 36:28.796
- What did you do to my wife?
- Stop!

36:33.336 --> 36:33.970
Brent?

36:35.805 --> 36:38.305
Make it stop, make it stop!

36:38.307 --> 36:39.142
Stop.

36:43.879 --> 36:46.950
- Did you not hear that?
- Hear what?

36:49.285 --> 36:50.951
You hear that, right?

36:57.526 --> 36:59.028
What the hell is going on?

37:01.198 --> 37:03.865
Am I the only one
scared shitless right now?

37:03.867 --> 37:05.200
Where's my gun?

37:05.202 --> 37:06.334
- You don't need your gun.
- I'll decide.

37:06.336 --> 37:07.569
No, I will.

37:07.571 --> 37:08.602
You don't need it,
Will was right.

37:08.604 --> 37:10.205
It's not trying to hurt us.

37:10.207 --> 37:11.839
It didn't try to
hurt me, it's not...

37:11.841 --> 37:13.075
Well, it certainly
tried to hurt me, Terry.

37:13.077 --> 37:15.109
That's because it thought
that you were gonna punch Will.

37:15.111 --> 37:16.611
I wasn't gonna
try and punch him!

37:16.613 --> 37:18.011
No, I know, but it thought
that you were, that's all!

37:18.013 --> 37:19.314
Oh shit, she's one
of them now, isn't she?

37:19.316 --> 37:21.415
Shut up John,
you're not helping!

37:21.417 --> 37:22.252
Guys!

37:25.455 --> 37:29.057
Dammit, I just can't get used
to you walking around again.

37:29.059 --> 37:30.959
- It's...
- I know.

37:30.961 --> 37:32.029
It's amazing.

37:41.470 --> 37:44.809
Mr. Doyle, FBI, we'd like
to have a word with you.

37:56.452 --> 37:58.019
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

37:58.021 --> 37:58.988
Slow your roll, Geronimo.

38:00.189 --> 38:01.524
Easier way to do things.

38:03.426 --> 38:05.392
Listen, what happened
with the professor?

38:05.394 --> 38:06.928
He's coming over later.

38:06.930 --> 38:07.964
Okay, good.

38:08.999 --> 38:10.198
How did he take the news?

38:10.200 --> 38:12.267
How do you think he took it?

38:12.269 --> 38:14.002
I thought the man was
gonna have a stroke.

38:14.004 --> 38:16.037
Should we be worried
he might tell someone?

38:16.039 --> 38:16.970
He won't.

38:16.972 --> 38:18.141
You guys ain't gonna never...

38:19.242 --> 38:21.975
Holy mother of God!

38:21.977 --> 38:23.012
What the hell?

38:25.915 --> 38:28.084
Please tell me you guys
are still you guys.

38:29.685 --> 38:31.084
I am.

38:31.086 --> 38:32.986
Where have you been?

38:32.988 --> 38:34.124
I think we got a problem.

38:36.459 --> 38:39.964
Mr. Doyle, FBI, we're armed
so please announce yourself!

38:44.401 --> 38:45.269
He's not home.

38:47.569 --> 38:49.102
We need the kit.

38:49.104 --> 38:51.242
Whoa whoa, easy killer.

38:52.107 --> 38:53.640
I'll get the kit.

38:53.642 --> 38:55.011
You take a Valium.

38:56.713 --> 38:57.548
Good Lord.

38:59.582 --> 39:01.015
How do you know
you weren't followed?

39:01.017 --> 39:02.316
I just act like
I was in a movie

39:02.318 --> 39:04.084
and made myself hard to find.

39:04.086 --> 39:06.120
Yeah, that must've been easy.

39:06.122 --> 39:07.587
You might wanna
take that up with God

39:07.589 --> 39:09.390
if you have a problem
with the way that I look.

39:09.392 --> 39:11.028
You might want
to rethink that.

39:12.995 --> 39:15.229
Do we really gotta be
in here with that thing?

39:15.231 --> 39:17.698
I mean, why can't we just go
and talk in the living room?

39:17.700 --> 39:20.435
Because unfortunately
I'm not wireless.

39:20.437 --> 39:22.736
I mean, doesn't that
shit creep y'all out?

39:22.738 --> 39:25.339
Look man, I'm still not
convinced that that thing

39:25.341 --> 39:27.408
is the beginning of
some kind of invasion.

39:27.410 --> 39:28.241
It's not.

39:28.243 --> 39:29.176
Oh, and you know?

39:29.178 --> 39:30.981
I know because it showed me.

39:32.281 --> 39:33.613
What did it show you?

39:33.615 --> 39:35.582
Things about itself.

39:35.584 --> 39:37.151
About where it comes from.

39:37.153 --> 39:40.053
You see that?

39:40.055 --> 39:41.555
This the shit I'm talkin' about.

39:41.557 --> 39:42.959
Please, Marcus!

39:44.394 --> 39:46.093
Do you know what
he's talking about?

39:46.095 --> 39:48.261
Did it show you that
stuff too, or...

39:48.263 --> 39:49.066
I'm not sure.

39:50.165 --> 39:51.232
What does that mean?

39:51.234 --> 39:53.000
I saw flashes of something
when it touched me,

39:53.002 --> 39:56.104
but it was so fast I
couldn't make sense of it.

39:56.106 --> 40:00.107
Like a dream that you can't
remember in the morning.

40:00.109 --> 40:00.944
I still see it.

40:01.611 --> 40:04.178
You guys, you gotta see it.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.214
Just let it touch you.

40:06.216 --> 40:07.615
Hell nah!

40:07.617 --> 40:10.084
Man, I ain't going
near that thing.

40:10.086 --> 40:11.118
Right?

40:11.120 --> 40:12.086
Did it hurt?

40:12.088 --> 40:12.722
No.

40:14.089 --> 40:16.189
It actually made me feel better.

40:16.191 --> 40:17.024
Better?

40:17.026 --> 40:19.227
Yeah, like I could
breathe easier.

40:19.229 --> 40:22.662
Well, then why were
you shaking on the floor

40:22.664 --> 40:24.399
when it touched you?

40:24.401 --> 40:26.801
I mean, you were
flailing around in pain,

40:26.803 --> 40:28.602
I saw it, you were in pain!

40:28.604 --> 40:31.238
No, it was trying
to figure me out.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.109
My injury confused it.

40:35.111 --> 40:36.444
I don't get it.

40:36.446 --> 40:39.046
The doctor said you'd
never walk again...

40:39.048 --> 40:40.751
I don't have
the answers, okay?

40:42.151 --> 40:44.218
Trust me when I say
that you'll understand

40:44.220 --> 40:45.086
when you bond with it.

40:45.088 --> 40:46.053
Nope.

40:46.055 --> 40:47.788
No thank you.

40:47.790 --> 40:49.290
I don't trust that thing.

40:49.292 --> 40:51.825
Isn't this what they
teach you in church?

40:51.827 --> 40:53.093
Blind faith?

40:53.095 --> 40:54.130
Look here, bro.

40:55.698 --> 40:58.131
Don't talk about miracles to me,

40:58.133 --> 41:00.133
'cause this ain't even
in the same ball park.

41:00.135 --> 41:02.105
Why can't this
be a miracle, huh?

41:08.111 --> 41:10.444
Why can't this be God?

41:10.446 --> 41:12.383
You better talk to
your brother, man.

41:13.615 --> 41:16.250
I don't appreciate him
questioning my faith.

41:16.252 --> 41:17.752
You know, next
time we might have

41:17.754 --> 41:20.687
to test your little
miracle theory

41:20.689 --> 41:23.691
and see if you can talk with
a broken jaw, how about that?

41:23.693 --> 41:25.493
Relax, Marcus.

41:25.495 --> 41:27.197
That's not what
he's trying to do.

41:28.798 --> 41:31.167
That's not what you're
trying to do, right?

41:32.502 --> 41:34.134
I'm outta here.

41:34.136 --> 41:36.169
And where are you going?

41:36.171 --> 41:37.738
I'm going to feed my cat!

41:37.740 --> 41:38.573
Just let him go.

41:38.575 --> 41:40.241
Are you coming back?

41:40.243 --> 41:41.709
Obviously!

41:41.711 --> 41:44.113
Since I'm the only
sane one amongst us.

42:27.156 --> 42:27.790
Hmm.

42:29.591 --> 42:32.162
Well, if he's got it, it's
sure as shit not here.

42:37.167 --> 42:38.198
Nothin'.

42:42.738 --> 42:43.572
Okay.

42:45.475 --> 42:47.274
Westlake's coming
over around 5:00 pm.

42:47.276 --> 42:48.508
Great.

42:48.510 --> 42:50.178
You hungry, want
to eat something?

42:50.180 --> 42:51.345
Maybe something small.

42:51.347 --> 42:54.281
- I'm starving, thanks Terry.
- Yeah.

42:54.283 --> 42:56.316
- Will?
- I'm fine.

42:56.318 --> 42:58.319
Hey, I'm starting to
smell like that thing.

42:58.321 --> 43:00.654
Do you mind if I
borrow a fresh T-shirt?

43:00.656 --> 43:02.126
- Sure.
- Thanks.

43:05.260 --> 43:05.896
You know...

43:08.198 --> 43:10.363
I really hope you know
what you're doing.

43:10.365 --> 43:11.464
Let me show you.

43:11.466 --> 43:12.301
- No, no.
- Please.

43:13.836 --> 43:14.671
Will...

43:16.939 --> 43:17.773
No.

43:21.276 --> 43:22.609
Get some sleep.

43:22.611 --> 43:24.412
I'm...

43:24.414 --> 43:25.249
I'm not tired.

43:58.513 --> 43:59.649
What's that?

44:01.283 --> 44:03.220
Maybe this guy knows where
we could find Mr. Doyle?

44:04.287 --> 44:05.355
Let's track him down.

44:06.488 --> 44:07.921
Sure, sure.

44:07.923 --> 44:09.457
One of us should
probably stay here though

44:09.459 --> 44:12.292
in case Mr. Doyle comes back.

44:12.294 --> 44:14.729
In this really nicely
air-conditioned

44:14.731 --> 44:17.298
not-stupidly-hot apartment.

44:17.300 --> 44:18.301
We should flip for it.

44:20.269 --> 44:21.271
Okay.

44:22.004 --> 44:22.939
I take heads.

44:23.872 --> 44:25.508
- You always get heads.
- I do.

44:29.412 --> 44:30.377
FBI.

44:30.379 --> 44:31.879
What the hell?

44:31.881 --> 44:34.015
Mr. Doyle, this is Agent
Tevis, I'm Agent Banks.

44:34.017 --> 44:35.950
Mr. Doyle, we'd just like
to ask you a few questions,

44:35.952 --> 44:37.220
if you don't mind.

44:39.622 --> 44:41.055
What the hell?

44:41.057 --> 44:43.292
There's one here that
I wanted to show you.

44:49.631 --> 44:50.466
Here.

44:54.537 --> 44:56.272
I used to love going here.

45:03.412 --> 45:06.381
It's been a long
time since I've been.

45:10.452 --> 45:12.021
It's
such a perfect day.

45:14.089 --> 45:16.292
It's such a perfect day.

45:17.827 --> 45:19.363
It's too much.

45:25.468 --> 45:26.435
It's too much.

45:40.350 --> 45:42.850
Professor, nice to meet you.

45:42.852 --> 45:43.783
Whoa...

45:43.785 --> 45:45.785
Ask him anything you want.

45:45.787 --> 45:47.787
I think you guys have
a lot to talk about.

45:47.789 --> 45:49.857
Oh my...

45:49.859 --> 45:53.394
You found this in a field?

45:53.396 --> 45:54.627
Yeah, they did.

45:54.629 --> 45:56.029
It's grown since we found it.

45:56.031 --> 45:58.566
Have you ever seen
anything like it before?

45:58.568 --> 46:01.569
Could I get a drink of water?

46:01.571 --> 46:02.406
Yeah.

46:04.539 --> 46:05.605
What do you think
that it wants?

46:05.607 --> 46:07.607
Give the man a second.

46:07.609 --> 46:10.044
It's okay, it's
not gonna hurt you,

46:10.046 --> 46:11.647
so don't be afraid.

46:14.649 --> 46:16.852
Thank you, thank you.

46:19.622 --> 46:22.826
It's just marvelous.

46:23.593 --> 46:25.595
Simply marvelous.

46:26.963 --> 46:28.497
I'd like to examine it.

46:29.999 --> 46:31.702
I'd like to examine you all.

46:33.870 --> 46:35.839
You played for
Georgia Southern, huh?

46:37.406 --> 46:39.573
I know you did, I saw you play.

46:39.575 --> 46:42.575
Division one AA
national champions.

46:42.577 --> 46:45.081
Four out of six years,
'85 through '90.

46:46.848 --> 46:48.948
And that was some
of you, my friend.

46:48.950 --> 46:49.816
Boom!

46:49.818 --> 46:50.984
Don't strike me
as an Eagles fan.

46:50.986 --> 46:52.185
Oh, hell no.

46:52.187 --> 46:54.522
Georgia State all
the way. Go Panthers!

46:54.524 --> 46:55.359
Woo-hoo!

46:56.526 --> 46:58.591
No, seriously, you
were good, man.

46:58.593 --> 47:00.660
This dude right here,

47:00.662 --> 47:03.464
one of the best tied
ends in the conference.

47:03.466 --> 47:04.101
Mmm!

47:05.167 --> 47:06.901
Why didn't you go pro?

47:06.903 --> 47:09.437
Yeah, why didn't you go pro?

47:09.439 --> 47:11.138
Oh...

47:11.140 --> 47:13.042
That's right, the injury.

47:13.575 --> 47:15.109
What a shame.

47:15.111 --> 47:17.544
All that raw talent
gone to waste.

47:17.546 --> 47:21.583
From all-American to
peanut farmer like that, huh?

47:25.655 --> 47:27.921
Mr. Doyle, why
don't you have a seat

47:27.923 --> 47:29.557
and tell us what you were doing

47:29.559 --> 47:31.894
at Roger Cobb's
farm this morning?

47:32.861 --> 47:34.160
I'd rather stand.

47:34.162 --> 47:36.732
No, you're gonna sit down.

47:40.236 --> 47:41.569
So that's not causing you

47:41.571 --> 47:44.772
any abnormal sensations
or discomfort?

47:44.774 --> 47:45.573
No.

47:45.575 --> 47:46.807
Even in your legs?

47:46.809 --> 47:48.475
It's like I was
never paralyzed.

47:48.477 --> 47:49.111
Huh.

47:50.078 --> 47:53.980
Physiologically, this
is quite impossible.

47:53.982 --> 47:55.616
You do know that?

47:55.618 --> 47:56.820
Of course I know that.

47:57.819 --> 48:00.821
Always hated needles.

48:00.823 --> 48:01.892
Yeah, me too.

48:03.959 --> 48:04.794
Now...

48:06.729 --> 48:08.198
What do we do about you?

48:12.502 --> 48:14.834
I'm not ready for that yet.

48:14.836 --> 48:18.742
I think it would feel
reassured if it could touch you.

48:20.042 --> 48:22.008
Why do you think that?

48:22.010 --> 48:24.678
It's just a feeling, I guess.

48:24.680 --> 48:26.683
Did it tell you
to let it touch me?

48:27.550 --> 48:30.586
It's more like a suggestion.

48:31.821 --> 48:33.587
It's hard to explain.

48:33.589 --> 48:34.988
I'd like you to try.

48:34.990 --> 48:38.894
Okay, well, it's like...

48:41.097 --> 48:42.562
He says it shows him things.

48:42.564 --> 48:43.599
Right, Will?

48:44.267 --> 48:45.165
That's what you said.

48:45.167 --> 48:46.633
Is that true?

48:46.635 --> 48:48.167
It shows me things, yes.

48:48.169 --> 48:49.970
Shows you what?

48:49.972 --> 48:53.640
It's kinda like memories.

48:56.711 --> 48:59.248
Your memories,
or its memories?

49:00.615 --> 49:01.650
Both.

49:02.752 --> 49:05.185
It's confusing most of the time.

49:05.187 --> 49:07.123
Some things are
clearer than others.

49:08.024 --> 49:09.256
Professor, you'd understand

49:09.258 --> 49:11.828
if you just let
it bond with you.

49:15.698 --> 49:18.799
I'd be lying if I told
you I wasn't scared.

49:18.801 --> 49:23.337
I was scared too, but I
actually felt better after.

49:23.339 --> 49:25.272
That's not exactly reassuring.

49:25.274 --> 49:27.073
You see, the rational
side of me says

49:27.075 --> 49:30.611
it's pumping you full of
endorphins or who-knows-what.

49:30.613 --> 49:33.680
It could be giving you the
illusion of euphoria...

49:33.682 --> 49:35.616
There's really
nothing we can say

49:35.618 --> 49:37.718
that's gonna convince
you, is there?

49:37.720 --> 49:40.087
There's nothing you can say

49:40.089 --> 49:42.589
that I can't explain
away with science.

49:42.591 --> 49:46.997
How can science
explain me walking?

49:48.064 --> 49:50.667
Almost nothing, yes, I...

49:52.767 --> 49:54.670
You have to ask
yourself, Professor.

49:55.870 --> 49:59.809
When faced with the unknown,
do you step away from the void?

50:01.377 --> 50:02.279
Or do you dive in?

50:06.682 --> 50:08.218
I've already faced the void.

50:36.077 --> 50:38.013
Pancreatic, stage four.

50:38.881 --> 50:39.683
I'm sorry.

50:40.950 --> 50:43.019
I've had a good
life, I just...

50:44.754 --> 50:46.623
I wish it could've
been a little longer.

50:49.825 --> 50:50.426
Maybe...

50:57.332 --> 50:58.867
What the hell was that?

51:00.301 --> 51:01.200
Did you see it?

51:01.202 --> 51:02.301
Tell me you saw it!

51:02.303 --> 51:03.238
I saw it, I saw it!

51:04.205 --> 51:05.040
What?

51:06.776 --> 51:07.711
I saw it.

51:13.082 --> 51:15.852
- Will!
- Will, come on!

51:17.185 --> 51:18.722
- Get out of there!
- Come on!

51:26.729 --> 51:28.365
It's getting larger.

51:29.330 --> 51:30.165
It's marvelous.

51:32.001 --> 51:33.403
Just marvelous!

51:36.305 --> 51:39.006
Look, I already answered
all your questions.

51:39.008 --> 51:40.707
Only thing you're doing
is repeating yourself,

51:40.709 --> 51:41.709
so I think you're done here.

51:41.711 --> 51:43.046
Oh, I don't think we're done.

51:44.847 --> 51:46.245
Tell me Marcus, have you found

51:46.247 --> 51:48.982
any unusual bruises
on your body?

51:48.984 --> 51:50.316
No, but you about to.

51:50.318 --> 51:51.752
Easy, Mr. Doyle.

51:51.754 --> 51:52.785
Look, I just want
y'all to leave.

51:52.787 --> 51:54.321
All right.

51:54.323 --> 51:56.122
Oh, but there's so much
more to say, Mr. Doyle.

51:56.124 --> 51:57.424
All right, look,

51:57.426 --> 51:59.729
let me just talk to my
partner for a moment.

52:13.843 --> 52:15.274
Think we should let him go.

52:15.276 --> 52:16.509
I just rattled his cage.

52:16.511 --> 52:17.511
Come on, let's see
where this thing leads.

52:17.513 --> 52:19.846
Have you ever heard
of the fourth amendment?

52:19.848 --> 52:21.115
Screw the fourth amendment!

52:21.117 --> 52:23.350
The pod is not here,
we are wasting time!

52:23.352 --> 52:26.455
Look, I am telling you
my gut says go with this.

52:31.861 --> 52:33.696
We're gonna give
him some breathing room.

52:34.863 --> 52:36.129
Do you really think
that that's gonna help?

52:36.131 --> 52:37.466
Yes, yes I do!

52:39.868 --> 52:41.234
Fine.

52:41.236 --> 52:42.805
But for the record, I disagree.

52:48.010 --> 52:50.843
Thank you very much
for your time, Mr. Doyle.

52:50.845 --> 52:52.481
That's all we need for now.

52:54.517 --> 52:56.953
Don't let the door hit you
in the ass on the way out.

53:08.430 --> 53:11.098
So what do you think this
thing is doing to Will?

53:11.100 --> 53:12.966
I don't know yet.

53:12.968 --> 53:14.834
Haven't had a chance
to run all the tests.

53:14.836 --> 53:18.872
Ah, well, you must have
some kind of opinion about it.

53:18.874 --> 53:20.874
I'd like to think I'm
a little more empirical

53:20.876 --> 53:23.345
than just giving you my hunches.

53:25.347 --> 53:26.850
Can I tell you what I think?

53:27.883 --> 53:28.917
Sure.

53:32.287 --> 53:35.288
I think this thing
is studying us.

53:35.290 --> 53:36.490
Like, I don't believe

53:36.492 --> 53:38.959
all that Invasion of
the Body Snatchers crap

53:38.961 --> 53:40.796
that Marcus seems
so concerned about.

53:41.964 --> 53:45.535
I think it's using Will
to gather information.

53:46.868 --> 53:47.937
For what purpose?

53:50.004 --> 53:52.441
You think it has
nefarious intentions?

53:53.908 --> 53:54.877
Actually...

53:56.245 --> 53:57.910
I hadn't thought that far ahead.

53:57.912 --> 54:00.980
But that's an
astute observation.

54:00.982 --> 54:05.551
You know, I might have to
revisit that grade I gave you.

54:05.553 --> 54:06.986
Well, I think it might be

54:06.988 --> 54:07.988
a little late for
that, Professor.

54:07.990 --> 54:11.158
There's one thing I've
come to realize, son.

54:11.160 --> 54:12.892
Nothing is ever too late.

54:12.894 --> 54:14.962
Yeah, well...

54:14.964 --> 54:18.064
School administration
might think otherwise.

54:18.066 --> 54:21.567
The hell
do they know, anyway?

54:40.890 --> 54:43.323
Good job loser,
I think he saw you.

54:43.325 --> 54:44.892
Calm down, he didn't see me.

54:44.894 --> 54:46.095
Oh, he saw you.

54:50.131 --> 54:51.834
Come on Brent,
answer this, man.

54:56.037 --> 54:56.937
You've
reached Brent Fleming.

54:56.939 --> 54:58.037
Leave a message.

54:58.039 --> 55:00.108
Brent, hey man...

55:00.975 --> 55:03.343
Call me as soon as you get this.

55:03.345 --> 55:04.912
I gotta figure out a way
to get up outta here,

55:04.914 --> 55:06.345
so I think it's best

55:06.347 --> 55:08.649
that I leave the car
parked at the restaurant.

55:08.651 --> 55:10.886
Come and get me, man,
soon as you can, bro.

55:11.986 --> 55:13.021
Peace.

55:17.026 --> 55:18.625
Shit!

55:18.627 --> 55:21.662
What part of I told
you so didn't you understand?

55:21.664 --> 55:22.930
I got it.

55:22.932 --> 55:24.363
Just keep an eye on his car

55:24.365 --> 55:26.399
in case he decides
to make a run for it.

55:26.401 --> 55:28.234
- You're not going.
- I am going, I am!

55:28.236 --> 55:30.002
No, Brent, if he said
that we're in danger

55:30.004 --> 55:31.270
then you're not going!

55:31.272 --> 55:32.506
He didn't say danger,
he said there's trouble!

55:32.508 --> 55:34.107
What is the difference?

55:34.109 --> 55:35.609
Oh, so you just want
me to abandon Marcus?

55:35.611 --> 55:36.442
Is that what you want?

55:36.444 --> 55:38.345
I am not saying no.

55:38.347 --> 55:40.948
Why doesn't Marcus
just come here?

55:40.950 --> 55:43.482
I told you, he
doesn't think it's safe!

55:43.484 --> 55:45.051
He said they could be watching!

55:45.053 --> 55:48.455
Okay, and how do you expect
to not be seen by them?

55:48.457 --> 55:50.991
I'm a lot smarter than
you give me credit for.

55:50.993 --> 55:52.024
That's not...

55:52.026 --> 55:53.028
Brent, you're not going!

55:54.095 --> 55:55.028
Can you do something?

55:55.030 --> 55:56.062
What am I supposed to do?

55:56.064 --> 55:58.131
Talk to him!

55:58.133 --> 55:59.232
Talk to him?

55:59.234 --> 56:01.638
Thanks, thanks.

56:04.272 --> 56:07.977
Talk to him.

56:10.011 --> 56:11.914
I haven't seen any
movement for a while.

56:12.981 --> 56:14.050
He's gotta be in there.

56:17.653 --> 56:19.319
See, told ya.

56:19.321 --> 56:21.421
Hold up, we got a car coming.

56:21.423 --> 56:23.089
Maybe it's that friend of his?

56:23.091 --> 56:25.227
- Yeah, okay, run the plates.
- On it.

56:29.731 --> 56:32.299
I have a vehicle
registered to a Jay Lou Park.

56:32.301 --> 56:36.105
26 years old, 5'7, black
hair, brown eyes, no priors.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.008
Are you Marcus?

56:42.611 --> 56:44.276
God!

56:44.278 --> 56:45.312
Sir, get out of the car.

56:45.314 --> 56:46.546
Get out of the car right now.

56:46.548 --> 56:48.151
Banks, what the
hell are you doing?

56:49.051 --> 56:51.151
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

56:51.153 --> 56:52.386
- Please don't shoot me!
- Get on your knees!

56:52.388 --> 56:54.287
Sorry, I thought you
were the guy who called!

56:54.289 --> 56:55.788
What?

56:55.790 --> 56:57.559
He's a goddamn Uber driver!

56:59.694 --> 57:01.363
Oh son of a bitch!

57:03.097 --> 57:05.165
Here, have a nice day.

57:05.167 --> 57:06.235
I'll just wait here.

57:17.780 --> 57:18.613
Dammit!

57:25.521 --> 57:28.220
Hey, come on, it
was your bright idea

57:28.222 --> 57:30.390
to give him breathing
room, remember, huh?

57:30.392 --> 57:32.591
You know what, let's just
go find out where he went.

57:32.593 --> 57:33.695
That's all we gotta...

58:07.361 --> 58:10.596
Huh, well
that's encouraging.

58:10.598 --> 58:11.767
What's that?

58:13.568 --> 58:17.236
The good news is that
none of you show any signs

58:17.238 --> 58:20.573
of unusual toxins
in your bodies.

58:20.575 --> 58:22.308
No radiation damage.

58:22.310 --> 58:23.776
Not even Will and Teresa?

58:23.778 --> 58:24.611
Nothing.

58:24.613 --> 58:26.279
Completely normal.

58:26.281 --> 58:27.116
Huh.

58:28.649 --> 58:29.850
Is there any bad news?

58:29.852 --> 58:31.220
For you, there is.

58:32.386 --> 58:34.854
Your cholesterol is
through the roof.

58:34.856 --> 58:37.125
You should probably
get that checked out.

58:43.131 --> 58:44.564
Can I help you with anything?

58:44.566 --> 58:45.768
And are you warm enough?

58:47.301 --> 58:49.604
I don't suppose
you have any weed?

58:52.508 --> 58:54.908
Are you being serious?

58:54.910 --> 58:58.245
Purely for medicinal
purposes, I assure you.

58:58.247 --> 59:01.647
Yeah, um, I'm more
of a beer guy myself.

59:01.649 --> 59:04.250
Maybe Brent might
have something.

59:04.252 --> 59:06.088
Don't worry about it.

59:21.903 --> 59:23.338
Are you afraid?

59:25.240 --> 59:26.408
Are we all?

59:28.243 --> 59:29.609
Marcus believes that we see

59:29.611 --> 59:31.214
all our loved ones after we die.

59:38.287 --> 59:42.792
Then there's gonna be a
lot of people waiting on me.

59:43.624 --> 59:45.227
You believe that?

59:46.827 --> 59:51.833
I've noticed you've taken
a liking to my butterflies.

59:53.202 --> 59:55.171
Maybe that's what
death is, a rebirth.

59:55.836 --> 59:58.437
Maybe we all become butterflies.

59:58.439 --> 59:59.573
Butterflies?

59:59.575 --> 01:00:00.877
Metaphorically speaking.

01:00:04.278 --> 01:00:07.948
You know, if you
really want to help,

01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:09.582
there's a notebook
out there on my desk.

01:00:09.584 --> 01:00:12.651
If you could grab that
for me I'd appreciate it.

01:00:12.653 --> 01:00:13.488
Okay.

01:00:44.486 --> 01:00:45.288
Professor?

01:00:46.588 --> 01:00:47.390
Professor?

01:00:49.992 --> 01:00:50.792
No!

01:00:53.928 --> 01:00:54.729
Hey.

01:00:55.997 --> 01:00:58.298
I just talked to Brent,
he's getting Marcus.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.665
They're gonna get here
as soon as they can.

01:00:59.667 --> 01:01:01.570
Okay, that's good.

01:01:02.903 --> 01:01:04.372
John, it's gonna be okay.

01:01:06.374 --> 01:01:08.475
I don't know what to do!

01:01:08.477 --> 01:01:09.843
Just try to calm down.

01:01:09.845 --> 01:01:11.944
Can you please come too?

01:01:11.946 --> 01:01:13.279
You know how those guys can be.

01:01:13.281 --> 01:01:15.548
John, I don't think so.

01:01:15.550 --> 01:01:17.716
Please, Terry!

01:01:17.718 --> 01:01:19.254
I really need you.

01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:21.354
Hey, what's going on?

01:01:21.356 --> 01:01:22.591
Yeah, you know what, okay.

01:01:23.758 --> 01:01:25.961
Yeah, John, we'll
come right away.

01:01:28.330 --> 01:01:29.498
What's that all about?

01:01:30.598 --> 01:01:31.830
It's the professor.

01:01:31.832 --> 01:01:33.732
John had to take
him to the hospital

01:01:33.734 --> 01:01:36.403
and we need to go right away.

01:01:36.405 --> 01:01:37.303
We are?

01:01:37.305 --> 01:01:38.671
I'm not going.

01:01:38.673 --> 01:01:40.640
- What?
- I'm not going.

01:01:40.642 --> 01:01:42.875
Will, I'm not
arguing with you.

01:01:42.877 --> 01:01:44.810
Terry, I don't need to
go and I don't want to go.

01:01:44.812 --> 01:01:46.546
Will, are you coming?

01:01:46.548 --> 01:01:47.913
I said no.

01:01:47.915 --> 01:01:48.751
Forget it.

01:02:00.961 --> 01:02:01.830
Hey, you know...

01:02:03.597 --> 01:02:05.433
I've been thinking...

01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:08.435
I have a really
interesting thought

01:02:08.437 --> 01:02:10.039
that I wanted to share with you.

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.343
What do you think?

01:02:24.019 --> 01:02:25.384
What do you want, Will?

01:02:25.386 --> 01:02:26.421
Hi Jess.

01:02:27.388 --> 01:02:28.988
So good to hear your voice.

01:02:28.990 --> 01:02:31.794
I just got off of work
and I want to go home.

01:02:33.394 --> 01:02:35.063
Is this something we
can talk about later?

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:38.466
There's something I
really need to show you.

01:02:39.633 --> 01:02:41.500
I'm really tired, Will.

01:02:41.502 --> 01:02:43.937
Jess, I can't explain
it over the phone.

01:02:43.939 --> 01:02:45.437
Please just drop by.

01:02:45.439 --> 01:02:47.607
I promise it's not
another painting.

01:02:47.609 --> 01:02:48.808
You sound better.

01:02:48.810 --> 01:02:50.042
I am.

01:02:50.044 --> 01:02:51.414
I'm a lot better.

01:02:53.147 --> 01:02:55.383
Is everything okay over there?

01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:58.417
Something happened earlier.

01:02:58.419 --> 01:03:00.754
Something happened when I
was on the phone with Terry.

01:03:00.756 --> 01:03:02.524
You'll understand
when you see it.

01:03:16.537 --> 01:03:17.673
Come on Terry.

01:03:39.693 --> 01:03:42.095
I don't see his car.

01:03:42.097 --> 01:03:43.629
You sure this is
where he was going?

01:03:43.631 --> 01:03:45.432
That's
what the driver said.

01:03:45.434 --> 01:03:47.403
Rhinehart's Oyster
Bar, Washington Road.

01:03:50.805 --> 01:03:52.705
I'm starvin'.

01:03:52.707 --> 01:03:54.377
Can we eat here too?

01:04:03.484 --> 01:04:04.850
Bro, how close are you?

01:04:04.852 --> 01:04:07.021
I see you, I'm
pulling in right now.

01:04:10.758 --> 01:04:11.593
Oh, I see.

01:04:23.504 --> 01:04:27.506
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:04:27.508 --> 01:04:29.908
John called, we have
to meet him at the hospital.

01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:30.912
Hospital?

01:04:50.999 --> 01:04:51.897
How you doing?

01:04:51.899 --> 01:04:52.767
Rachel Clark?

01:04:54.202 --> 01:04:56.439
I'm Agent Tevis, this is
Agent Banks with the FBI.

01:04:57.638 --> 01:04:59.037
What do you want?

01:04:59.039 --> 01:05:00.939
Want to ask you some
questions, if you don't mind.

01:05:00.941 --> 01:05:02.008
I'm working.

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:03.044
We won't be long.

01:05:06.647 --> 01:05:07.814
What do you want to know?

01:05:07.816 --> 01:05:10.015
Your colleague over there
says that you are friendly

01:05:10.017 --> 01:05:11.519
with a Mr. Marcus Doyle?

01:05:12.586 --> 01:05:13.852
What about him?

01:05:13.854 --> 01:05:16.555
We happen to believe
that he might be here.

01:05:16.557 --> 01:05:17.624
Well, I haven't seen him.

01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:18.691
You positive?

01:05:18.693 --> 01:05:19.926
It's pretty busy.

01:05:19.928 --> 01:05:21.560
He's kinda hard to
miss, don't you think?

01:05:21.562 --> 01:05:23.062
Don't get snippy.

01:05:23.064 --> 01:05:24.296
It's a touchy subject.

01:05:24.298 --> 01:05:26.665
I dated his buddy and
it didn't end well.

01:05:26.667 --> 01:05:28.667
Once a cheater, always
a cheater, right?

01:05:28.669 --> 01:05:29.504
Hmm.

01:05:30.506 --> 01:05:31.941
It wouldn't happen to
be this guy, would it?

01:05:34.175 --> 01:05:35.109
Yep, that's him.

01:05:36.243 --> 01:05:37.146
What's his name?

01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:39.611
John.

01:05:39.613 --> 01:05:40.482
Johnathan Brandt.

01:05:41.649 --> 01:05:43.716
We're looking for him, too.

01:05:43.718 --> 01:05:45.187
Well, I haven't
seen him, either.

01:05:46.988 --> 01:05:48.787
He's probably with Brent.

01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:49.624
Brent who?

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:52.126
He wouldn't be a friend
of Marcus too, would he?

01:05:54.328 --> 01:05:55.995
Look...

01:05:55.997 --> 01:05:57.296
These are good guys
and I don't want

01:05:57.298 --> 01:05:59.064
to get them into
any kind of trouble.

01:05:59.066 --> 01:06:01.600
Darlin', they're
already in trouble.

01:06:01.602 --> 01:06:03.770
Yeah, we're trying to
get them out of trouble.

01:06:03.772 --> 01:06:06.275
Look, I promise you
we're here to help them.

01:06:07.642 --> 01:06:08.941
You know what, let's
start with an easy one.

01:06:08.943 --> 01:06:10.512
What's Brent's last name?

01:06:14.348 --> 01:06:15.615
Fleming.

01:06:15.617 --> 01:06:16.649
You sure?

01:06:16.651 --> 01:06:17.283
You hesitated a little.

01:06:17.285 --> 01:06:18.750
Brent Fleming?

01:06:18.752 --> 01:06:19.588
Yes.

01:06:22.691 --> 01:06:24.656
I want an APB
on a Brent Fleming

01:06:24.658 --> 01:06:27.093
in any vehicle
registered in his name.

01:06:27.095 --> 01:06:28.196
Oops.

01:06:32.600 --> 01:06:35.604
Hey, could you get me a
Diet Coke to go, please?

01:06:38.205 --> 01:06:39.040
Thank you.

01:06:41.676 --> 01:06:43.679
- Hello?
- In here.

01:06:44.879 --> 01:06:45.881
In the garage.

01:06:50.785 --> 01:06:52.588
Hey, thanks for coming.

01:06:53.321 --> 01:06:54.156
You sounded...

01:06:55.055 --> 01:06:56.788
It concerned me.

01:06:56.790 --> 01:06:57.957
So good to see you.

01:06:57.959 --> 01:07:00.993
I can't believe
it's been a year.

01:07:00.995 --> 01:07:02.662
Where are the others?

01:07:02.664 --> 01:07:03.895
I thought they'd be here.

01:07:03.897 --> 01:07:05.131
I don't know,
they're not here.

01:07:05.133 --> 01:07:06.799
They left you
here by yourself?

01:07:06.801 --> 01:07:10.039
Yeah, I mean, I'm a grown-up,
I can take care of myself.

01:07:11.906 --> 01:07:13.238
What did you want
to show me, Will?

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.243
I can't stay long.

01:07:16.044 --> 01:07:19.245
Still so hard to
look at me, huh?

01:07:19.247 --> 01:07:20.245
This is not the time for this.

01:07:20.247 --> 01:07:22.115
Haven't I been
punished enough?

01:07:22.117 --> 01:07:23.049
That's not fair.

01:07:23.051 --> 01:07:23.685
Fair to who?

01:07:24.752 --> 01:07:26.754
Since when is any of this fair?

01:07:27.789 --> 01:07:28.787
I don't want to do this.

01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:29.624
Jess, wait.

01:07:36.731 --> 01:07:38.300
What are you doing?

01:07:48.443 --> 01:07:50.109
What's it look like?

01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:51.343
How?

01:07:51.345 --> 01:07:52.780
That's what I'm
gonna show you.

01:07:55.249 --> 01:07:56.851
This is amazing.

01:07:58.185 --> 01:07:59.021
Ready?

01:08:08.363 --> 01:08:09.765
Oh shit.

01:08:15.169 --> 01:08:17.937
Apparently he doesn't
have any family.

01:08:17.939 --> 01:08:19.171
It's just him.

01:08:19.173 --> 01:08:20.840
So what do they
expect us to do?

01:08:20.841 --> 01:08:21.676
Nothing.

01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:25.010
The way the doctor explained,
it's just a matter of time.

01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:26.411
And John's with him?

01:08:26.412 --> 01:08:28.214
Yeah, room four.

01:08:28.216 --> 01:08:30.349
He was so alive
just a few hours ago.

01:08:30.350 --> 01:08:31.720
- You don't think...
- No.

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:35.758
The nurse said he was taking
a lot of pain medications.

01:08:36.423 --> 01:08:38.357
I know what you're thinking.

01:08:38.359 --> 01:08:40.361
This wasn't caused
by anything we did.

01:08:41.895 --> 01:08:43.895
Or it did.

01:08:43.897 --> 01:08:45.700
Then how can you be so sure?

01:08:47.033 --> 01:08:48.935
Let's just get
this over with, okay?

01:08:51.805 --> 01:08:54.372
My goal was to die teaching.

01:08:54.374 --> 01:08:57.777
But you already are a teacher.

01:08:57.779 --> 01:08:59.746
No, I mean
physically teaching,

01:08:59.747 --> 01:09:02.749
right in the middle
of a class, boom!

01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:03.849
Go out in a blaze of glory

01:09:03.850 --> 01:09:06.885
in front of a whole lecture
hall full of students.

01:09:06.886 --> 01:09:09.322
Yeah, that sounds
a little crazy.

01:09:09.323 --> 01:09:12.759
Yeah, but it's got a
certain amount of panache.

01:09:14.395 --> 01:09:15.327
Knock knock.

01:09:15.328 --> 01:09:17.330
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

01:09:17.332 --> 01:09:19.298
I wasn't expecting company.

01:09:19.300 --> 01:09:20.966
This is our friend Marcus.

01:09:20.968 --> 01:09:23.001
He was one of the people
who found the object.

01:09:23.002 --> 01:09:24.836
I've got someone
else to thank.

01:09:24.837 --> 01:09:26.005
Thank you, Marcus.

01:09:26.006 --> 01:09:28.174
We just want to let you
know that we're here for you

01:09:28.176 --> 01:09:29.809
if you need anything.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.045
Great, let's start with
getting me the hell out of here.

01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:34.246
What are you doing?

01:09:34.247 --> 01:09:35.947
I am not spending
the final hours

01:09:35.948 --> 01:09:37.416
of my life in a hospital.

01:09:37.417 --> 01:09:39.452
I don't think that
you can do that.

01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:40.923
I can do anything I want.

01:09:42.022 --> 01:09:43.890
That's the privilege
of the dying.

01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:49.997
We should
just go inside.

01:09:51.131 --> 01:09:52.835
Don't get your
panties in a twist.

01:09:53.834 --> 01:09:55.268
He'll be out in a minute.

01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:56.536
Visiting hours are over.

01:09:56.538 --> 01:09:59.205
We don't even know
if they're in there.

01:09:59.207 --> 01:10:00.441
Oh, he's in there.

01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:02.778
You know?

01:10:04.212 --> 01:10:05.944
Yeah.

01:10:05.946 --> 01:10:08.150
It's a gut thing, cops have it.

01:10:11.586 --> 01:10:14.586
I trust your gut like
I trust your smile.

01:10:14.588 --> 01:10:16.855
Look,
you know the type.

01:10:16.857 --> 01:10:18.523
Feel like he got one over on us.

01:10:18.525 --> 01:10:20.928
Instead he got sloppy
and make a mistake.

01:10:22.062 --> 01:10:23.996
We should just
go in and find out.

01:10:23.998 --> 01:10:25.598
Let's just see
how this Brent guy fits in.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.834
Look, we're wasting time,

01:10:27.836 --> 01:10:29.402
and you know we
don't have the time...

01:10:29.404 --> 01:10:30.205
Bingo.

01:10:41.882 --> 01:10:44.519
You should really
trust my gut more often.

01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.129
Hey, hey...

01:11:28.529 --> 01:11:30.299
It's okay, it's okay.

01:11:31.498 --> 01:11:34.599
I'm so sorry, that
was really uncool.

01:11:34.601 --> 01:11:35.870
What is going on?

01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:40.309
You were standing.

01:11:42.010 --> 01:11:44.042
Were you standing?

01:11:44.044 --> 01:11:45.044
And what was that thing?

01:11:45.046 --> 01:11:46.679
Just go easy, okay?

01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:48.947
You fell and hit your
head, so take it easy.

01:11:48.949 --> 01:11:50.349
- You were standing!
- Yeah.

01:11:50.351 --> 01:11:52.518
You were standing, I saw you!

01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:55.453
Yes, I was standing, okay?

01:11:55.455 --> 01:11:56.891
It's a miracle.

01:11:58.293 --> 01:12:00.059
Please tell me
what is going on.

01:12:00.061 --> 01:12:02.627
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to scare you.

01:12:02.629 --> 01:12:05.096
I'm really not trying
to scare you any more.

01:12:05.098 --> 01:12:06.001
I'm so sorry.

01:12:07.368 --> 01:12:10.568
What is going on?

01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:13.104
And what is that thing?

01:12:13.106 --> 01:12:13.941
This...

01:12:15.976 --> 01:12:17.578
I'm gonna explain
to you, I promise.

01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:22.380
This could be a
new start for us.

01:12:22.382 --> 01:12:25.084
I really think that this
could fix what we lost.

01:12:25.086 --> 01:12:26.318
What?

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.388
No, Jess...

01:12:28.455 --> 01:12:29.688
Don't look at me like that Jess.

01:12:29.690 --> 01:12:30.723
- Don't touch me.
- Listen Jess...

01:12:30.725 --> 01:12:32.390
No Will, don't touch me!

01:12:32.392 --> 01:12:33.662
Don't touch me!

01:12:34.995 --> 01:12:36.594
Jessica?

01:12:36.596 --> 01:12:38.630
What are you doing here?

01:12:38.632 --> 01:12:40.534
What is she doing here?

01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:43.105
I screwed up.

01:12:48.443 --> 01:12:50.608
Can we deal with
this later please?

01:12:50.610 --> 01:12:53.612
Can someone please just
tell me what is going on?

01:12:53.614 --> 01:12:55.246
Where should we put him?

01:12:55.248 --> 01:12:57.082
On the floor, by the alien.

01:12:57.084 --> 01:12:58.617
- Uh, really?
- What?

01:12:58.619 --> 01:12:59.655
Just do it.

01:13:00.687 --> 01:13:01.923
Easy, Professor.

01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.457
I can't really explain
it, but it's amazing.

01:13:05.459 --> 01:13:06.294
It's amazing.

01:13:14.668 --> 01:13:18.439
Will, Will, I discovered
something amazing.

01:13:19.606 --> 01:13:23.776
It's collecting your DNA.

01:13:23.778 --> 01:13:26.545
Our DNA.

01:13:26.547 --> 01:13:29.514
The samples I took,
they contained strands

01:13:29.516 --> 01:13:31.986
from you and from her.

01:13:33.421 --> 01:13:36.455
I don't understand it, but
it's there, it's there.

01:13:36.457 --> 01:13:37.389
Why?

01:13:37.391 --> 01:13:38.791
I don't know, I'm not sure,

01:13:38.793 --> 01:13:45.267
but I have a theory
that I wanted to test.

01:13:53.473 --> 01:13:55.644
What is it doing to him?

01:13:56.677 --> 01:13:58.246
It's helping him.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:04.486
But it wants our help, too.

01:14:09.723 --> 01:14:12.060
What do you mean our help?

01:14:14.061 --> 01:14:16.062
Hard to understand.

01:14:16.064 --> 01:14:19.165
It's telling me to
let it touch you.

01:14:19.167 --> 01:14:20.135
Telling you?

01:14:21.802 --> 01:14:22.636
Asking.

01:14:26.807 --> 01:14:28.709
- Terry...
- I want you to do it too.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:37.084
We're gonna do it
together, all of us.

01:14:40.721 --> 01:14:42.121
Look, I know you're scared.

01:14:42.123 --> 01:14:42.854
Damn right!

01:14:42.856 --> 01:14:44.126
Yeah, well, I was scared too.

01:14:46.194 --> 01:14:47.596
I've been scared all my life.

01:14:48.762 --> 01:14:50.731
I'm not gonna keep
living in fear.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.568
And whatever this thing is,

01:14:56.137 --> 01:14:58.206
I don't believe that
it means to hurt us.

01:14:59.306 --> 01:15:00.408
That's what I believe.

01:15:01.508 --> 01:15:02.541
Marcus, you have your faith.

01:15:02.543 --> 01:15:04.079
You know what I'm talking about.

01:15:05.445 --> 01:15:07.149
So stop being scared.

01:15:11.252 --> 01:15:13.055
Bro, do you believe this?

01:15:14.821 --> 01:15:16.425
I guess I do, yeah.

01:15:34.574 --> 01:15:35.577
I guess I do, too.

01:15:47.187 --> 01:15:48.390
If I'm right about this...

01:16:02.570 --> 01:16:03.801
No!

01:16:03.803 --> 01:16:05.437
No, I have no idea
what's going on!

01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:07.840
No, no, Will!

01:16:07.842 --> 01:16:08.677
No!

01:16:15.248 --> 01:16:16.249
It's time.

01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:24.226
I always wanted my life
to matter for something.

01:16:24.758 --> 01:16:26.427
To mean something.

01:16:29.262 --> 01:16:31.263
And I was afraid it
was too late for that,

01:16:31.265 --> 01:16:34.302
and I was afraid that I
was going to die alone.

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:38.606
And look how lucky I am!

01:16:54.221 --> 01:16:55.222
He's gone.

01:16:59.694 --> 01:17:00.992
It killed him!

01:17:00.994 --> 01:17:02.196
Did it kill him?

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.301
This exactly why I said I
should've had first watch.

01:18:16.303 --> 01:18:17.803
What's happening, Will?

01:18:17.805 --> 01:18:19.371
Do you know?

01:18:19.373 --> 01:18:20.339
I don't know.

01:18:20.341 --> 01:18:21.810
Maybe part of its life cycle.

01:18:23.043 --> 01:18:24.742
Maybe he needs to grow.

01:18:24.744 --> 01:18:26.745
I don't know.

01:18:26.747 --> 01:18:29.316
What, you telling me this
thing's gonna get bigger?

01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:37.723
Are you okay?

01:18:37.725 --> 01:18:39.358
Will, what is it doing?

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:40.328
Hold on, hold on.

01:18:41.361 --> 01:18:42.560
What do you mean hold on?

01:18:42.562 --> 01:18:43.362
Is it hurting you?

01:18:43.364 --> 01:18:45.333
It wants to touch...

01:18:47.068 --> 01:18:48.369
It wants to touch you.

01:18:52.405 --> 01:18:55.541
Oh, I don't give a shit
what that thing needs.

01:18:55.543 --> 01:18:56.711
Please just...

01:18:58.445 --> 01:18:59.280
Stay.

01:19:00.547 --> 01:19:01.380
Why is it hurting you?

01:19:01.382 --> 01:19:03.081
It's not hurting.

01:19:03.083 --> 01:19:05.552
It's just telling me so much.

01:19:08.355 --> 01:19:10.758
For some reason this
is important, though.

01:19:12.693 --> 01:19:13.858
No.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:15.027
- Please?
- No!

01:19:15.029 --> 01:19:18.900
We'll understand
what all this is about.

01:19:20.735 --> 01:19:22.533
- Please, just please.
- No!

01:19:22.535 --> 01:19:23.704
- Please!
- No!

01:19:24.739 --> 01:19:25.707
Fuck all of you!

01:19:28.943 --> 01:19:30.509
FBI, get on the floor now!

01:19:30.511 --> 01:19:32.643
Don't move, get
down, don't move!

01:19:32.645 --> 01:19:33.444
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, hey, be cool!

01:19:33.446 --> 01:19:34.848
Don't touch my wife!

01:19:35.982 --> 01:19:36.948
Don't touch me!

01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:39.417
I don't wanna be here!

01:19:42.589 --> 01:19:44.889
She needs her
inhaler, asshole!

01:19:44.891 --> 01:19:46.657
Get your hands off me!

01:19:46.659 --> 01:19:49.161
- Get back!
- Don't move!

01:19:49.163 --> 01:19:51.333
Shit, just lost picture.

01:19:52.165 --> 01:19:54.436
Screw it, I'm going in.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:01.543
No!

01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:10.685
Cease fire, cease fire!

01:20:30.137 --> 01:20:31.406
Hurry, hurry!

01:20:35.176 --> 01:20:36.544
Come on, baby.

01:20:46.686 --> 01:20:47.488
Will!

01:20:48.721 --> 01:20:50.054
Will!

01:20:56.564 --> 01:21:00.532
Just listen, please
just listen to me.

01:21:00.534 --> 01:21:01.403
There's no time.

01:21:02.735 --> 01:21:05.136
I need you to let it touch you.

01:21:05.138 --> 01:21:07.706
No, please, no, Will, no.

01:21:07.708 --> 01:21:11.876
Please, I can feel
it slipping away.

01:21:11.878 --> 01:21:13.480
Sorry, I can't!

01:21:17.083 --> 01:21:19.651
There's no time.

01:21:19.653 --> 01:21:21.122
No, I'm sorry, no!

01:21:22.489 --> 01:21:23.590
I need you.

01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.430
I don't know what to do.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.537
I don't want to
be alone anymore.

01:21:37.104 --> 01:21:38.636
Why?

01:21:38.638 --> 01:21:40.208
Why did you leave me?

01:21:43.977 --> 01:21:44.878
I need you.

01:21:45.812 --> 01:21:47.813
I'm so sorry.

01:22:20.681 --> 01:22:23.051
Please don't leave me.

01:22:28.087 --> 01:22:29.590
Hurry up slowpoke.

01:22:35.628 --> 01:22:36.830
Around, around...

01:22:38.598 --> 01:22:41.233
See, that's it, you'll get it.

01:22:41.235 --> 01:22:43.835
- Get some napkins.
- Do you have to ask?

01:22:43.837 --> 01:22:44.935
That's my girl.

01:22:44.937 --> 01:22:46.203
Sweetie, why don't you
hand your ice cream to Mama

01:22:46.205 --> 01:22:47.805
while you get buckled, huh?

01:22:47.807 --> 01:22:50.211
- I can do it.
- Listen to Daddy sweetie.

01:22:51.611 --> 01:22:54.580
- Don't take a bite.
- When do I do that?

01:22:54.582 --> 01:22:56.881
You always eat my ice cream.

01:22:56.883 --> 01:23:00.685
- Oh, you mean like this?
- Mommy, stop!

01:23:02.823 --> 01:23:06.325
Daddy, don't let
her eat my ice cream.

01:23:09.163 --> 01:23:11.630
I can't stay, Will.

01:23:11.632 --> 01:23:12.700
I can't stay!

01:23:13.734 --> 01:23:15.867
Please don't go.

01:23:20.074 --> 01:23:22.610
- I'm sorry.
- I am so sorry.

01:23:24.645 --> 01:23:27.312
It wasn't your fault, I know
it wasn't your fault Will.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:40.595
Will!

01:23:59.346 --> 01:24:00.615
Banks, Banks!

01:24:04.251 --> 01:24:06.921
- Good?
- Yeah, go, go!

01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:22.136
Marcus.

01:24:24.704 --> 01:24:26.774
You need to come with us.

01:24:28.107 --> 01:24:29.877
What have you done?

01:25:47.354 --> 01:25:48.189
Shannon?

01:25:51.158 --> 01:25:52.927
I don't understand.

01:25:58.498 --> 01:25:59.700
Who are you?

01:26:18.819 --> 01:26:19.854
I'm all of you.

01:26:34.534 --> 01:26:36.369
Please don't leave me.
