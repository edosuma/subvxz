WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:07.139
Yeah, I was just going over
to his place tonight.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.208
We're gonna netflix and chill.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.609
(Chuckles)

00:11.212 --> 00:12.711
- Thank you.
- Okay. See you.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.013
Customer: I know.

00:14.015 --> 00:16.048
So, are we still on
for <i>backgammon</i> tonight?

00:16.050 --> 00:19.118
Or maybe, instead, you and me,
we can netflix and chill.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.319
(Door closes)

00:20.321 --> 00:21.353
What?

00:21.355 --> 00:24.023
Yeah, watch
a netflix movie and chill.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.357
You see <i>the fugitive?</i>

00:26.227 --> 00:28.327
Mr. Kim.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.729
"Netflix and chill"
does not mean watch a movie.

00:30.731 --> 00:34.066
Yeah, netflix is stream movie.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.335
It's code for
the bedroom rodeo.

00:37.171 --> 00:38.370
Buttering the biscuit.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.074
The beast with two backs.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.076
- Sex.
- No!

00:44.078 --> 00:46.045
It's a very popular euphemism,
if I understand correctly.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.646
(Inhales)
I think it's a meme.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.215
- Yo, umma!
- Uh?

00:50.217 --> 00:52.284
What's "netflix and chill"?

00:52.286 --> 00:53.419
Sex.

00:53.788 --> 00:55.788
- How you know that?
- Everybody know that.

00:55.790 --> 00:57.222
I don't know that.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.291
You is old.
Young people talk,

00:59.293 --> 01:01.060
I listen, I learn.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.327
And I told her.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.462
(Laughs)

01:04.198 --> 01:05.731
You is old, too!

01:08.302 --> 01:09.601
- What's a "meme"?
- Hmm?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.837
(Theme music playing)

01:30.257 --> 01:35.494
So, I'm thinking we can do
a sea foam green.

01:35.663 --> 01:38.330
With an apocalypse sunrise
for the accent wall.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.666
- Accent wall?
- Just don't buy too much.

01:40.668 --> 01:43.802
Remember to give us phone
number for new apartment.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.471
You've got my cell number.

01:45.473 --> 01:47.806
Not a cell number,
home number.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.141
We're getting a home phone?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.409
I don't think they
make those anymore.

01:50.411 --> 01:52.277
Yeah, for calling home.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.378
You could just text me.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.281
I don't want to text you,
I want to talk to you.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.118
You could wait until
I come to work every day.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.352
You know, someone called
my phone the other day.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.453
I freaked.

02:01.455 --> 02:02.521
Who was it?

02:02.523 --> 02:05.090
I didn't answer. What kind
of weirdo calls people?

02:05.092 --> 02:06.125
I think that was me.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.967
Can we just pick out
some things for our place?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.395
- Is that okay, appa?
- Hmm.

02:10.397 --> 02:13.799
I don't know. Text me,
I'll get back to you.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.305
(Door opening)

02:27.815 --> 02:29.181
Shannon: Morning.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.349
Good, thanks. You?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.219
(Sighs)

02:34.889 --> 02:36.288
- Dude.
- I know.

02:36.290 --> 02:38.357
- Get it together.
- It's together.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.728
Hey, what do you think
those boots say?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.830
"I'm not a vegetarian."

02:44.832 --> 02:46.465
I think she broke up
with Alejandro.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.834
Fresh look, fresh start.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.335
The time has Jung.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.904
- Stop saying that.
- You love it.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.973
Hey, Jung,
are you free Friday night?

02:56.310 --> 02:59.278
Uh... maybe.
What did you have in mind?

02:59.280 --> 03:01.747
There's this great new rooftop
restaurant downtown,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.815
impossible to get into,
amazing tapas...

03:03.817 --> 03:05.150
Oh, I love
those little guys.

03:05.152 --> 03:07.319
(Chuckles) Same!

03:07.320 --> 03:09.560
Anyway, Alejandro somehow got
a Friday night reservation.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.290
For three?

03:11.292 --> 03:12.457
(Laughs)

03:12.459 --> 03:14.726
Funny.
So, can you close for me?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.595
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.497
Thank you.
You're the best!

03:18.732 --> 03:19.898
Nice boots, by the way.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.568
Oh, thanks.
They're from Spain.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.369
Alejandro has a hook-up.

03:24.371 --> 03:28.240
He has so many hook-ups,
he's hooked up with everybody.

03:28.442 --> 03:29.992
(Door closes)

03:29.993 --> 03:31.543
Jung/shannon doomsday clock
moved one minute closer

03:31.545 --> 03:33.212
- to midnight.
- What?

03:33.214 --> 03:35.581
You gotta make a move.
And soon.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.216
Man, she's with Alejandro.

03:37.218 --> 03:41.353
How with?
Is he on her screensaver?

03:41.355 --> 03:43.755
Does she say "we" did
something this weekend?

03:43.757 --> 03:46.358
Do her eyes light up
when she sees him?

03:47.828 --> 03:48.927
What are you doing?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.662
Lighting up my eyes.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.730
You look scared.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.933
Love is scary.
Get used to it.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.705
Why are the cans so small?

03:59.707 --> 04:01.807
They're testers.
To test paint on at home.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.909
But they're all
the same color.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.777
- Thought it'd be cheaper.
- And is it?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.279
No. Not at all, actually.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.314
- (Door bell tinkles)
- Hey.

04:09.316 --> 04:10.682
Hey. Check this out.

04:10.884 --> 04:11.950
(Door closes)

04:12.419 --> 04:13.485
Shower curtains.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.420
I think those
are just curtains.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.656
Oh...

04:17.658 --> 04:18.790
Still works.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.660
Yeah. I don't think
I can do this.

04:22.529 --> 04:23.862
Fine, we'll get
shower curtains.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.330
No, the apartment.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.432
What do you mean?

04:27.434 --> 04:29.268
Second year's
just so expensive,

04:29.270 --> 04:31.570
and I didn't even
think about things

04:31.572 --> 04:33.839
like hydro, or food,
or Internet,

04:33.841 --> 04:35.474
and the home phone.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.875
So, it is happening?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.243
We're not getting
a home phone.

04:38.245 --> 04:40.279
And if you guys are mad
at me, I get it.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.316
No, we're not mad.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.285
I mean,
it is super last minute.

04:46.287 --> 04:47.953
And we can't really afford it
without you.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.888
And some of us don't have
any other options.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.990
And now,
we're homeless people.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.559
Right.
And I know it sucks.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.862
But it just feels so good

04:56.864 --> 04:58.497
for me to get this
off my chest.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.731
- Great!
- Yeah.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.733
I have been wanting to say
something for weeks.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.001
Weeks.

05:03.370 --> 05:04.970
Thanks, guys.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.507
Jung: Thanks for taking the
time to talk to me, Shannon.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.677
I've been thinking about
a lot of things lately.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.880
Thinking about you...

05:16.250 --> 05:17.716
And me.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.220
I like you.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.622
I... (Clears throat)

05:23.624 --> 05:25.557
I like, like you.

05:25.959 --> 05:27.592
I like you.

05:27.594 --> 05:30.295
I like you. I like you.

05:30.297 --> 05:31.496
What's the matter, Terence?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.999
Guy can't practice
a love speech by himself?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.501
It's just... there's a family
waiting for the car.

05:36.503 --> 05:39.771
So what?
Are they dying?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.340
I didn't ask.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.842
Jung: I want to
take you on a date.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.044
Special guest, big towel.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.312
Thanks, Mrs. Kim.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.481
I really appreciate
you guys putting me up.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.749
But don't go in
the medicine cabinet.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.317
Okay.

05:52.318 --> 05:53.884
Yeah, he's really interested
in your Berry-flavored tums.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.620
And don't use my shampoo.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.755
You use sham...

05:57.758 --> 05:59.391
I mean, for sure.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.259
And, Gerald,
if you need snack,

06:01.261 --> 06:02.327
just take from store.

06:02.329 --> 06:03.862
Or you can ask
Janet to make.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.664
- I'm not making you anything.
- Yeah, I know.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.899
Why you give to him big towel?

06:07.901 --> 06:11.002
Appa, Gerald is homeless.
We have to help.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.804
Janet is supposed
to be moving out,

06:12.806 --> 06:14.706
not Gerald moving in.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.575
- Cramp style.
- What style?

06:16.710 --> 06:21.346
Empty-nest style, uh?
Kids all gone.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.349
We can have cozy time anytime.

06:24.351 --> 06:26.385
Morning, afternoon,

06:26.387 --> 06:29.421
even between national
and local news.

06:29.423 --> 06:30.956
Cozy time can wait.

06:31.325 --> 06:35.360
And only temporary until
they find a new roommate.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.062
And you know, sometime,

06:37.064 --> 06:41.099
you can have cozy time
before and after local news.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.502
No, only one.
Have to choose.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.537
(Mutters)

06:48.342 --> 06:49.875
Hey.

06:50.611 --> 06:54.813
Just filing my files...
In the filing cabinet.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.148
Sounds about right.

06:59.386 --> 07:01.686
Hey, look at those cuties.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.456
Oh! My cousins?

07:04.458 --> 07:05.857
Uh, those were cats before.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.826
I should put up
some new pictures.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.362
We got some great ones
at the cottage.

07:10.364 --> 07:11.430
"We"?

07:11.698 --> 07:14.533
Me and my cousins.
They're hilarious.

07:14.868 --> 07:15.934
Cool.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.069
Hey, here's something else
that you might find

07:18.071 --> 07:19.538
kind of funny.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.641
Or hopefully not.
But, uh... the...

07:23.677 --> 07:24.876
Okay.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.679
I've been thinking a lot
about a lot of things lately.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.841
- And...
- Terence: Found one.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.515
Oh, thank you so much.

07:30.517 --> 07:31.650
No problem.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.819
Do you need a ruler?

07:33.821 --> 07:35.353
No.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.989
Good. 'Cause it took me
all morning to find that one.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.860
So, as I was saying...

07:41.862 --> 07:43.161
Sorry, could this wait?

07:43.163 --> 07:44.463
I just remembered

07:44.465 --> 07:45.997
I have to make
a super important phone call.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.732
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

07:47.734 --> 07:48.967
Thanks.

07:50.604 --> 07:51.670
(Line ringing)

07:53.140 --> 07:54.806
- (Dead line beeping)
- Oh, my god!

07:56.510 --> 07:57.976
Oh, my god. Carol.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.645
I'm so sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.355
It says this apartment
is "unique."

08:10.357 --> 08:12.390
What do you think that means?

08:12.392 --> 08:14.593
I think it means there's
a toilet in the living room.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.627
Okay.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.862
Uh... oh!

08:16.864 --> 08:19.731
"New carpets, minutes
to subway, very intimate."

08:19.733 --> 08:20.866
It's a little expensive.

08:22.803 --> 08:24.002
You know I licked that.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.704
Good. Thank you.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.005
You're disgusting.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.406
Thank you. Yeah.

08:28.408 --> 08:29.875
"Fully furnished."
This one's fully furnished.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.444
"Open concept loft,
queen bed frame included."

08:32.446 --> 08:33.545
What about this one?

08:33.547 --> 08:34.846
"Cozy one bedroom plus den,"

08:34.848 --> 08:36.114
"perfect for couple,
hardwood's throughout..."

08:36.116 --> 08:38.416
Stop! What you doing?

08:38.418 --> 08:40.719
- Looking for a place.
- Just the two of you?

08:41.622 --> 08:43.455
We couldn't find
another roommate.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.190
So, now, I have no choice
but to live with Gerald.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.691
You don't need
to say it like that.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.594
You move in with Gerald
if you marry Gerald.

08:49.596 --> 08:50.729
I was always going
to live with Gerald.

08:50.731 --> 08:51.796
What's the difference?

08:51.798 --> 08:54.065
Two girl, one boy,
no problem.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.635
One girl, one boy,
that's a couple.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.936
'Cause Semira
is the only reason

08:57.938 --> 08:59.037
I don't sleep with Gerald.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.138
Again, it's the tone.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.674
I make my decision.
That's final.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.943
I'm 20.
I don't need your approval.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.745
We're getting an apartment
and we're moving out.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.613
Oh! So, you
don't need my approval?

09:08.615 --> 09:11.917
Okay. Maybe you don't need
my free grocery,

09:11.919 --> 09:15.153
my paying you good money,
my co-sign you lease.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.022
- We might need that.
- Oh, my god!

09:17.024 --> 09:19.024
- (Sighs)
- You, "oh, my god!"

09:19.026 --> 09:20.992
- (Screams)
- (Scoffs)

09:24.498 --> 09:26.731
Thanks again
for the hospitality.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.101
That's my big towel.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.706
I not overreact.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.108
Gerald's a pussycat.
They're just friends.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.813
Long time ago, in the forest,

09:41.815 --> 09:45.584
young man go on a camping trip
with a beautiful young woman,

09:45.586 --> 09:47.586
just as a friend.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.955
Then, first night in tent...

09:49.957 --> 09:51.256
I know this one.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.124
He wore a goalie mask
and attacked her

09:53.126 --> 09:54.259
with a canoe paddle.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.861
No, it's romantic.

09:56.863 --> 09:58.997
I just invite Mrs. Kim
on a camping trip

09:58.999 --> 10:00.165
with other friend.

10:00.167 --> 10:01.600
So, you were the attacker?

10:01.602 --> 10:04.002
I just forget to
invite other friend,

10:04.004 --> 10:06.171
and only bring one tent.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.173
So, you lied in order
to take advantage

10:08.175 --> 10:09.608
of an innocent young woman.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.276
She is not
innocent young woman,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.344
she is my wife.

10:12.813 --> 10:13.878
Why you say that?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.080
Why you come that way?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.181
So I can hear
what you're saying.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.882
- (Grumbles)
- Oh, he was just telling me

10:17.884 --> 10:20.819
about the time
he pounced on you in a tent.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.187
Why you telling him
that story?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.756
- (Exclaims)
- Classic Stockholm syndrome.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.324
Appa: Stockholm what?

10:26.326 --> 10:28.727
When a prisoner falls in love
with her captor.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.895
(Chuckles)
He is not my captor.

10:30.897 --> 10:32.998
That's what everyone
with Stockholm syndrome says.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.667
Point is boy and girl
always end up

10:35.669 --> 10:39.204
like me and Mrs. Kim
on camping trip.

10:39.206 --> 10:40.939
But you liked each
other the whole time.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.841
Yeah.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.342
Does Janet like
Gerald that way?

10:44.344 --> 10:46.111
I don't think so.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.113
But Gerald is still man.

10:48.115 --> 10:51.683
And if they living together,
then so easy to make mistake.

10:51.685 --> 10:54.285
And if girl make mistake,
that's it.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.954
Yeah, better to stay home.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.355
Better for who?

10:59.393 --> 11:00.659
That's my tea.

11:03.797 --> 11:04.863
Hey.

11:04.865 --> 11:06.631
Oh, hey.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.199
You can leave those.
My mom will change it.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.834
No, I don't mind.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.670
Speaking of change,

11:11.672 --> 11:13.838
did you ever meet
my cousin, Tim?

11:13.840 --> 11:14.939
No.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.208
Funny story. So,
he's in a frat house, right?

11:17.210 --> 11:19.644
And I guess there was
this hazing incident.

11:19.646 --> 11:22.681
He's not actually legally
allowed to talk about it,

11:22.683 --> 11:26.151
but the funny part is
they're a roommate short.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.089
You're pulling a Semira!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.424
Well, I still have to pledge.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.161
Just give me one more week.
And we'll find a place.

11:36.163 --> 11:37.328
And we can stay here
till we do.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.731
Yeah, I don't think so.

11:39.733 --> 11:42.100
I mean, your dad's always,
like, watching me

11:42.102 --> 11:44.736
and your mom won't stop asking
about my ex-girlfriends.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.237
Welcome to my life.

11:46.239 --> 11:48.440
(Sighs) It does feel good
to get this off your chest.

11:48.442 --> 11:50.108
I've been holding it in
since lunch.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.209
You just ate.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.044
Yeah, I just got the call.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.379
(Sighs)

12:02.389 --> 12:05.690
It's a great deal,
tons of character.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.158
And a couch in the backyard.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.259
So, when are you and, uh...

12:08.261 --> 12:09.327
Janet: <i>Gerald.</i>

12:09.329 --> 12:10.929
Gerald moving in?

12:10.931 --> 12:12.430
He's not. It's just me.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.332
I decided it's better
to be on my own.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.734
Less hassle.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.970
No one telling me what
to do, or not to do...

12:18.972 --> 12:20.905
And what do appa and umma
think about this?

12:21.808 --> 12:23.108
(Sirens wailing at a distance)

12:23.110 --> 12:24.175
They haven't seen it.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.177
It's like when you moved out.
You didn't ask them.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.414
But I was kicked out.
Well, it was complicated.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.416
- You could have stayed.
<i>- Not really.</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:33.017
Listen, don't go
doing anything stupid

12:33.019 --> 12:34.185
just to get back at appa.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.721
I'm not.
I'm just getting a place.

12:36.723 --> 12:37.789
A great place.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.925
You're not the only one
who can get

12:40.927 --> 12:42.647
their own great place
and do what they want.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.162
Okay.

12:45.198 --> 12:47.432
Also, I'm going to need a Van.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.570
(Sniffing) Mmm...

12:53.073 --> 12:55.206
Galbi-jjim,
just the way I like.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.809
Just the way Janet like.
Welcome home dinner.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.010
She never leave.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.111
Thanks to us.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.280
Also, goodbye
to Gerald dinner.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.116
Yeah!
He use half my old spice.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.920
He is a good boy.
But this is best.

13:08.922 --> 13:11.089
Sometime, have to be strict.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.757
That's what good parents do.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.059
Ah... if we don't say no,
who say no?

13:15.061 --> 13:17.195
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.330
Not my job to be best friend.

13:19.332 --> 13:22.934
Appa: Yeah, many friend,
but only one parent, huh?

13:22.936 --> 13:27.505
Okay, two.
Maybe three, if step-parent.

13:27.874 --> 13:29.140
(Door bell tinkles)

13:29.743 --> 13:30.842
- Hi.
- Hey.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.811
You're Janet, right?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.980
- Uh... yeah.
- I'm Keith from the house.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.348
57 Cornwall?

13:37.350 --> 13:40.451
Landlord sent me
to check your references.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.287
(Sighs)

13:42.289 --> 13:43.755
So, you work here?

13:43.757 --> 13:44.856
Yeah.

13:46.293 --> 13:47.492
That checks out.

13:49.462 --> 13:50.862
Do you live at the house, too?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.864
Oh, yeah, I've been
there for a while now.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.899
I'm sort of between rooms
at the moment,

13:54.901 --> 13:57.402
but you know,
you're gonna love it.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.903
There's, uh...

13:58.905 --> 14:03.408
There's me, Spencey, Juniper,
gnarls, the Sams.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.476
We've got, like, four Sam's.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.278
In a five-bedroom?

14:07.280 --> 14:08.346
Oh...

14:08.348 --> 14:09.914
You got a whole bedroom?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.916
Nice.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.852
Janet: So, it's just
the extension cord?

14:13.854 --> 14:16.754
We sort of borrow power
from the neighbours.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.823
So, you'll probably
want to bring a few of those.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.124
You have any super long ones?

14:20.126 --> 14:21.492
No. So, it's $12.50.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.961
Oh! Yeah.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.931
Hey, when you
drop off your deposit,

14:26.933 --> 14:27.999
you wanna see Spencey.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.868
He can probably pop
your ankle monitor.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.169
I don't have an ankle monitor.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.338
Oh, yeah.
No, me neither.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.475
See you around, roomie.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.447
Janet, what's happening?

14:42.582 --> 14:45.250
I found a place.
It's great.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.986
And you don't have to worry
about me living with one boy,

14:47.988 --> 14:50.054
because there's five at least.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.489
I'm assuming
Juniper is a girl,

14:51.491 --> 14:53.091
but I don't know that
for sure.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.425
It should be a fun surprise.

15:04.571 --> 15:05.870
(Knocks)

15:05.872 --> 15:08.206
Hey. We never did finish that
conversation the other day.

15:09.075 --> 15:10.241
(Sighs)

15:10.243 --> 15:11.542
Or if this is a bad time...

15:11.544 --> 15:12.944
No, it's not that.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.112
Can you please close the door?

15:14.114 --> 15:15.446
Uh, yeah, sure.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.417
- What's wrong?
- I just...

15:19.419 --> 15:21.920
I thought I could make
it work, but it's a bad fit.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.922
I think I was trying
to be someone I'm not.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.156
And now, I'm stuck.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.359
Hey, it's okay,
I'm here for you.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.329
Have you told him yet?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.398
- What?
- Alejandro.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.366
Oh!
'Cause he got me the boots?

15:36.603 --> 15:38.536
The boots!

15:38.538 --> 15:40.004
- You're stuck in the boots!
- Yes.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.072
Can you please help me?

15:41.074 --> 15:43.107
Yeah, yeah.

15:43.343 --> 15:45.610
Okay, why don't we just, um...

15:45.612 --> 15:47.979
Okay, maybe, if you
put two hands on the...

15:48.315 --> 15:50.081
Oh, my god!
Are you okay?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.916
Oh, my god!

15:51.918 --> 15:53.017
(Breathing heavily)

15:53.453 --> 15:56.554
Thank you.
You are the best!

15:59.592 --> 16:01.292
Shannon, I...

16:01.294 --> 16:03.027
Oh, my god!

16:03.029 --> 16:04.529
- Alejandro.
- Hey, man.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.032
Hey, wow... fun.

16:08.034 --> 16:09.167
Can you pass me the boot?

16:09.169 --> 16:10.601
- Seriously?
- Yeah, he's coming.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.136
Terence: Yeah, she's in there.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.138
Okay, get this back on...
Ow, ow.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.142
What are you
doing here, mister?

16:18.144 --> 16:19.610
I couldn't stay away.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.613
Thank you. I love them.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.349
Well, I'll see you two later.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.984
Oh, you were gonna
tell me something.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.919
Uh...

16:27.921 --> 16:29.887
It's okay, man.
Pretend like I'm not here.

16:29.889 --> 16:31.155
As if we could.

16:31.157 --> 16:35.093
We exceeded our rental quota
by 20% this month.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.095
So, good on us.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.998
Oh! I know. I told you
that in the staff meeting.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.201
I guess I'm still just riding
that high, you know?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.268
(Chuckles)

16:44.270 --> 16:46.104
Okay, back to work. Me.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.672
Good to see you, man.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.507
Good to see you, too.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.282
Well, I'm on my way.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.550
Gotta drop off a check
at my new place.

16:59.552 --> 17:01.552
- Okay, have a good time.
- I will.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.021
- Sounds good.
- Gonna be great.

17:03.289 --> 17:04.989
- Appa!
- What's this?

17:04.991 --> 17:06.624
It's her life,
she know what's best.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.259
You do you, Janet.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.128
- That's the plan.
- Stop!

17:10.530 --> 17:11.996
You don't want this.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.264
You don't want this!

17:13.266 --> 17:14.699
I don't want this.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.735
I know Gerald
is maybe mistake.

17:18.471 --> 17:21.305
But ankle monitor man
is definitely mistake.

17:22.409 --> 17:26.144
Janet, you're a smart girl.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.579
Best thing is stay home.

17:29.149 --> 17:31.449
Is that what <i>halmoni</i> told you
when you came here?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.084
No! She say...

17:33.086 --> 17:35.153
(Speaking Korean)

17:35.155 --> 17:36.988
That is different.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.723
I just want to move
across town.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.358
You crossed the ocean.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.594
We have to.
To make better life for you.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.731
Yeah, I know.
But wasn't it also for you?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.699
Because you wanted to move?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.338
I just wanted to move out.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.207
Maybe not into that house.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.576
And not without
you guys on board.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.278
(Sighs)

18:00.280 --> 18:01.479
So, I'll just stay home.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.648
Okay.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.984
Great, well,
then we're all happy.

18:06.986 --> 18:08.252
You not let me finish.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.725
Okay, go find a good place.

18:14.727 --> 18:16.160
For you and roommate.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.261
Even Gerald.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.230
Really?

18:20.767 --> 18:22.066
Thank you!

18:22.068 --> 18:25.103
But you can't use
apocalypse sunrise

18:25.105 --> 18:26.471
as accent wall.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.538
So terrible color.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.707
Ugh! Says the couple
with the furry toilet seat.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.750
How many guys
come out from a coma?

18:39.752 --> 18:42.253
I felt like I had to give him
his room back.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.255
Well, beta kappa phi's loss

Umma: Janet, come!

18:46.226 --> 18:48.126
Housewarming present.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.095
Very best roommate.

18:51.097 --> 18:52.330
So big.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.831
Also, rice cooker.

18:53.833 --> 18:55.766
Second one we have.
Now, it's yours.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.201
Okay, thanks.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.137
And vitamin. All kind.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.238

19:00.240 --> 19:02.073
Most favourite calendar

19:02.075 --> 19:04.342

19:04.344 --> 19:06.144
Different charger and cord.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.445
Okay, now, you're
just getting rid of junk.

19:07.447 --> 19:11.215
No. Not just junk. Look.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.217
Picture of your
umma and your appa.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.452
Janet: Oh.

19:15.088 --> 19:17.388
That is nice. Thank you.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.826
And for you, Gerald.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.729
Just me.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.499
Cool.
This is something I have now.

19:41.447 --> 19:42.513
(Sighs)

19:43.683 --> 19:45.216
All right,
all right, all right.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.285
I'm good. I don't need...

19:47.287 --> 19:50.221
Cut the wheel. Yeah, cut.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.090
All right,
all right, all right.

19:53.092 --> 19:54.525
Stop. Good.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.726
Thank you.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.396
Okay, turn the wheel.
Get close.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.167
All right,
all right, all right.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.235
Stop.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.406
(Car door opens)

20:12.612 --> 20:13.711
Hey.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.313
Hi.

20:16.849 --> 20:19.283
So, uh, how's the place?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.819
It's better than
the last place.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.625
Okay, see you.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.993
Yeah.

20:36.769 --> 20:38.269
(Appa sighs)

20:40.273 --> 20:41.572
So empty.

20:41.574 --> 20:42.673
Yeah.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.476
I miss having everyone here.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.579
House feel like
when we first move in.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.680
Mmm.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.583
But now,
I can have my office, huh?

20:52.585 --> 20:54.619
Your office?
No, it's my sewing room.

20:54.621 --> 20:55.686
You never sew.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.721
Because I don't
have sewing room.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.556
Because you don't sew.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.224
(Umma sighs)

21:00.226 --> 21:02.627
Maybe we should
just leave like this

21:02.629 --> 21:03.961
in case Janet come back.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.030
Yeah.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.533
Or we can make
into home theater.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.302
Surround sound.

21:11.304 --> 21:12.503
Cupholder in chair.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.772
Yeah, now, you talking.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.741
Empty-nest style!

21:16.743 --> 21:18.376
(Both laughing)

21:18.811 --> 21:20.778
- I miss Janet.
- Yeah. Who?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.880
