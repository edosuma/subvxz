NARRATOR:
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:06.255
- You took everything from me.
- Let bygones be bygones.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.049
- Resentment gets old.
STEFAN: You know what never gets old?

00:09.217 --> 00:10.467
- Revenge.
- No.

00:10.635 --> 00:11.969
What? Missing something?

00:12.137 --> 00:14.304
Three sleeping Originals, four coffins.

00:14.514 --> 00:16.056
Who is in the lockbox?

00:16.265 --> 00:18.267
I think I know who can open the coffin.

00:18.476 --> 00:19.852
STEFAN: Who is this?
BONNIE: My mom.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.771
- I wanna help you.
- You have no magic and I don't trust you.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.982
Maybe you can help me
get my magic back.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.651
To break the sire bond,
you gotta make yourself turn.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.028
[ROARS]

00:29.195 --> 00:30.571
- Oh, my God.
- Run!

00:31.781 --> 00:33.532
ALARIC: Is he gonna make it?
- Not on his own.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.242
- What is that?
MEREDITH: Vampire blood.

00:35.410 --> 00:36.452
Show me the coffins.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.079
- Where's the fourth?
- Not here.

00:39.289 --> 00:42.875
- I assume Klaus didn't get his coffins.
DAMON: I was able to get one of them out.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.210
- The locked one.
- Probably a good choice.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.838
- Why don't we talk about this?
- What did you do?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.382
[YELLS]

00:51.092 --> 00:52.926
Elijah.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.388
You look surprised to see me.

00:57.307 --> 01:00.559
So it wasn't you that removed
the dagger from my chest.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.853
You look like
you could do with a drink.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.230
And we have a lot to discuss,
so shall we?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.275
[BOTH GRUNTING]

01:09.694 --> 01:13.072
Easy. I just finished renovating.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.537
You know, you have every right
to be mad at me.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.582
But I kept my word.
I reunited you with our family.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.130
Don't make me do this
to you again, Elijah.

01:30.340 --> 01:34.343
Come on, use it. I dare you.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.262
You'll have Kol to deal with.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.020
- Mikael is dead.
- What did you say?

01:45.230 --> 01:49.399
I killed him with his own weapon.
He's gone, Elijah, forever.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.364
Why do our family remain
in these coffins?

01:55.532 --> 01:59.576
Finn for over 900 years,
Kol for over a century.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.495
Because of Stefan Salvatore.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.790
He holds the one thing
keeping me from freeing them.

02:04.999 --> 02:08.961
There are things that you do not know
about our past, Elijah.

02:09.169 --> 02:11.839
Our mother's death,
things I never wanted you to know.

02:12.006 --> 02:14.508
But I'm ready to tell you now.

02:16.719 --> 02:22.599
I only ask that you remember the oath
of loyalty you once swore to me.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.916
I need you to stand by my side.

02:48.084 --> 02:50.252
Be my brother.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.380
Help me destroy Stefan...

02:53.548 --> 02:57.176
...and I promise you
our family will be whole again.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.395
ELENA: Morning.
- Thought we had aspirin.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.480
Behind the vitamins.

03:14.944 --> 03:17.112
- You're hungover.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.072
It was a bit of a weird night.

03:19.240 --> 03:22.659
I told you, you don't have to feel guilty
about inviting Meredith here.

03:22.827 --> 03:25.037
I know. And I thank you for that.

03:25.205 --> 03:29.499
But I do feel guilty for whiskey-dialing
her at 2 in the a.m.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.252
- Ugh, no, you didn't.
- Oh, yes, I did.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.005
- Was she cool about it?
- As soon as these aspirin...

03:35.215 --> 03:37.758
...kick in and I
remember the conversation...

03:37.967 --> 03:39.259
...I'll let you know.

[DOORBELL RINGS]

03:46.309 --> 03:47.976
Sheriff Forbes, hi.

03:48.144 --> 03:49.228
Is everything okay?

03:49.395 --> 03:52.356
This is an unconventional conversation
we're about to have...

03:52.523 --> 03:54.983
...so I hope you'll protect me on it.
ALARIC: Of course.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.694
You've heard our medical examiner
was murdered...

03:57.862 --> 04:00.989
...the night of the fundraiser?
- Yeah, Brian Walters. Why?

04:01.157 --> 04:04.493
We've been investigating. Someone
drove this stake through his heart.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.290
That's one of ours.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.252
This is one of the set
from your parents' lake house.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.461
That's why I'm here.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.339
I haven't told anyone,
but forensics ran it for prints...

04:17.507 --> 04:19.048
...and found only one clean set.

04:21.469 --> 04:22.511
Yours.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.097
What?

04:25.306 --> 04:26.765
So you're the prime suspect?

04:26.933 --> 04:29.559
ELENA: She doesn't think I did it,
she's trying to find out...

04:29.727 --> 04:33.021
...why somebody used my family's
weapon to kill a Council member.

04:33.189 --> 04:38.235
Well, why don't you ask Ric if his dirty
little doctor had access to the weapons.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.696
- You're on speakerphone.
DAMON: I'm just saying...

04:40.905 --> 04:43.490
...first suspect is usually the right one.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.409
ALARIC:
Brian Walters was killed days ago.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.786
I didn't show Meredith
this until last night.

04:48.037 --> 04:50.414
- It wasn't Meredith.
- Brian was her ex-boyfriend.

04:50.581 --> 04:54.042
- Ric saw them fighting that night.
- It's not Meredith, okay?

04:54.210 --> 04:57.254
I refuse to believe that your luck
with women is that tragic.

04:57.463 --> 04:59.298
Who else knows
about your slayer stash?

04:59.465 --> 05:03.885
Who doesn't? I got weapons everywhere.
Here, the school, my loft, your car.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.972
It's Klaus. It has to be.
He's just screwing with us.

05:07.432 --> 05:08.807
What if it was Stefan?

05:09.058 --> 05:13.020
He was crazy that night. You know,
he was trying to get under Klaus's skin.

05:13.187 --> 05:15.397
He was capable
of pretty much anything.

05:15.565 --> 05:20.736
Ah, makes me nostalgic for the time when
Stefan was a bunny-snacking pacifist.

05:20.903 --> 05:24.239
- Anyway, gotta go. More later.
- Hey, where are you?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.408
Tea with an old friend.

05:27.785 --> 05:31.496
Elijah. My favorite Original.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.791
Back from the dead.
You clean up nice.

05:35.001 --> 05:39.129
- You left something in my jacket pocket.
- Yeah.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.508
"Dear Elijah, let's get together.

05:43.676 --> 05:47.095
Plot the destruction
of your brother. XOXO."

05:47.638 --> 05:49.639
- Damon.
- Was I right to undagger you...

05:49.807 --> 05:51.391
...or are we gonna have a problem?

05:52.101 --> 05:54.770
I'm here. Let's talk.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.606
I'll start with an easy question.

05:58.900 --> 06:01.068
Any idea what kind of
Klaus-killing weapon...

06:01.235 --> 06:03.820
...could be magically sealed
in a mystery coffin?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.657
ABBY: Slow down.
STEFAN: Keep up.

06:07.825 --> 06:08.909
We don't have much time.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.454
- Sorry, Stefan, I didn't have a choice.
STEFAN: There's always a choice, Bonnie.

06:12.622 --> 06:14.831
You made it
and now we have to live with it.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.126
You told Klaus where the coffins were
and he took them.

06:18.336 --> 06:21.254
- All of them except this one.
ABBY: That's the one that's sealed?

06:21.422 --> 06:25.300
STEFAN: Yup. Fortunately, it seems to be
the one he cares about most.

06:27.053 --> 06:30.305
- Aren't you coming inside?
- Vampires can't get in.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.475
Damon had to compel a couple
gardeners to bring the coffin in.

06:33.976 --> 06:35.102
This is a bad idea.

06:35.269 --> 06:37.729
If you're really the key
to opening that coffin...

06:37.897 --> 06:40.065
...it's a safe bet you're
on Klaus' hit list.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.944
I suggest you hide out here and figure
out a way to open the damn thing.

06:44.153 --> 06:48.281
- I told you. I don't have any powers.
- And I don't believe you.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.868
Look, time's ticking. Won't be long
before Klaus calls his hybrids...

06:52.036 --> 06:54.621
...to find that coffin and kill all of us.

06:54.789 --> 06:59.668
So dig deep, Abby Bennett,
scrape out whatever magic you have left.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.560
- What are you doing here?
- Bonnie told me you'd be here.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.397
- I need to talk to you.
- Well, there's nothing to talk about.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.693
- I'm focused on getting this coffin open.
- Did you kill the medical examiner?

07:30.533 --> 07:34.411
- Why would you think I did that?
- I don't know what you're capable of.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.706
- Believe what you want, Elena.
- I don't wanna believe any of it.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.624
But you had to ask me anyway.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.128
Stefan...

07:43.337 --> 07:47.257
Did you ask Damon
if he killed anybody lately?

08:04.859 --> 08:07.694
- Are you Caroline?
- Yes. Dr. Fell, hi.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.280
Elena told me you helped out my dad.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.575
I did. Do you think you can get him
to be a little grateful?

08:13.743 --> 08:17.746
He spent the night threatening to get
my license revoked for saving his life.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.166
Yeah, my dad's a little set in his ways.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.295
Um, he's spent his whole life
hating vampires so...

08:25.463 --> 08:28.673
So he's not psyched about it being
vampire blood that healed him.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.176
Yeah, he made that clear. Heh.

08:31.928 --> 08:36.640
I'm sorry. My bedside manner
sucks on no sleep.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.143
Um, so can I take him home?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.772
I signed his discharge papers
last night to shut him up.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.982
Oh, I...

08:46.150 --> 08:47.943
He didn't call or anything.

08:51.489 --> 08:52.989
That's gotta be hard.

08:53.157 --> 08:56.952
When your dad hates the one thing
you can't change about yourself.

08:57.161 --> 09:00.622
I make it my business to know
who the vampires are in this town.

09:00.790 --> 09:03.917
Medical curiosity. I don't blab.

09:04.085 --> 09:05.794
Yeah, we've had our ups and downs.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.213
Tell your dad I said "you're welcome."

09:10.049 --> 09:11.800
Thanks.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.974
- That was fast.
- Yeah, he's not here.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.017
He was already discharged.

09:21.185 --> 09:25.564
And she seems perfectly nice, by
the way. A little intense, maybe, but...

09:25.731 --> 09:28.608
It's sweet you wanna make sure
Alaric's not dating a psycho.

09:28.818 --> 09:33.113
- He's my family. I have to look out for him.
- Shh, shh.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.365
What?

09:35.533 --> 09:36.575
I hear it.

09:36.742 --> 09:38.034
[PHONE RINGING]

09:38.202 --> 09:39.869

Oh, my God. Daddy. Daddy. Dad.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.084
- Oh, my God.
- No. Don't be dead. Don't be dead.

Don't be dead. Oh, my God.

in his system.

What?

10:42.099 --> 10:43.600
[GASPS]

10:45.936 --> 10:48.480
This is the only grimoire you kept?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.774
It was the only one I needed.

10:51.233 --> 10:54.235
So, what is all of this?

10:54.403 --> 10:56.446
Family history.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.324
About a mother who
loved her children so much...

10:59.492 --> 11:01.951
...she couldn't bear the thought
she might lose them.

11:02.119 --> 11:04.371
So she turned them into vampires.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.498
One of them is Klaus.

11:06.666 --> 11:10.168
The one you're trying to kill
with whatever is in that coffin?

11:10.961 --> 11:14.756
There's nothing in here that's going
to help. I've seen most of these spells.

11:16.133 --> 11:19.594
- What was this?
- A spell I used to seal Mikael in a tomb.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.138
I burned it. Tried to get it out of my head.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.140
It didn't work, though.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.644
Wait. Do you see this?

11:27.895 --> 11:29.270
It's a sealing spell.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.773
We're trying to open something...

11:31.941 --> 11:33.316
...not seal it shut.
- No.

11:33.484 --> 11:35.944
Right here on the side. It's a blood knot.

11:36.112 --> 11:39.489
It means to bind it,
you need two generations.

11:39.657 --> 11:44.994
A bloodline.
Like two keys to a safety deposit box.

11:45.162 --> 11:51.626
So unbinding it would reverse the spell?

11:52.336 --> 11:55.463
Unseal it? If we did it together?

11:59.677 --> 12:03.054
DAMON: Get dressed. We're going out.
- Yeah, sorry, not interested.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.016
I didn't ask. Elijah and I have scheduled
a very old-fashioned sit down...

12:07.184 --> 12:09.853
...with you and Klaus.
I say you go with the black.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.688
Makes you look all villainy.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.732
Klaus won't make a deal, Damon.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.569
He doesn't have to.
All we're doing is buying a little time...

12:17.737 --> 12:21.489
...to give our wicked witches
a chance to pop the top off the coffin.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.533
STEFAN:
So that's your, uh, plan?

12:23.701 --> 12:26.035
- Stall Klaus?
- If you hadn't gone postal...

12:26.203 --> 12:27.662
...maybe I'd have options.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.081
So you unleash an Original
to help him out.

12:30.249 --> 12:33.835
Undaggering Elijah was smart, Stefan.
Are you kidding me?

12:34.003 --> 12:36.588
After what Klaus did to him?
He's in vengeance mode.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.674
There's nothing smart
about trusting Elijah, Damon.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.719
He screwed us over the last time
he promised to help us.

12:42.970 --> 12:45.680
The way you've been acting,
I trust him about as much as I trust you.

12:45.848 --> 12:49.058
Hmm. Well...

12:49.894 --> 12:52.896
...I guess that goes both ways,
doesn't it?

12:53.647 --> 12:58.067
Oh, yes. This is about me kissing Elena.

12:59.570 --> 13:02.363
If it wasn't for Klaus,
you wouldn't have become a dick...

13:02.531 --> 13:04.449
...and that kiss
would've never happened.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.869
So get ready and get happy.
We're going to negotiate a fake truce.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.497
I don't want your attitude
screwing it up.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.957
I compelled the nurse
to stay out of this room.

13:13.125 --> 13:16.586
- You'll be safe here.
- My wound is completely healed.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.340
- I need something to eat.
CAROLINE: Daddy, why don't you...

13:20.508 --> 13:22.550
...come lay down and just relax.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.887
I can't. I'm too wired.
My pulse is racing.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.473
It's the effect of my body
wanting to transition.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.601
- Maybe Dr. Fell can give you something.
- She's done enough.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.147
- I called your mom.
- Thanks.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.776
- Mr. Forbes, did you see your attacker?
BILL: I didn't see anything.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.403
I tried to sneak out.
Someone came from behind.

13:42.613 --> 13:45.281
We'll figure this out,
but in the meantime...

13:45.449 --> 13:47.158
...we need to get you some blood.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.954
I'm not gonna drink any blood.

13:51.163 --> 13:54.749
You have to. You died
with vampire blood in your system.

13:54.959 --> 13:59.629
If you don't feed and finish the
transition into a vampire then you'll die.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.798
I understand how it works.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.176
And that's what I'm prepared to do.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.973
Now get me out of this hospital.
I smell blood everywhere.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.445
- What are you doing?
- Taking inventory.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.949
- Did you bring it?
- Did I steal evidence from a crime scene?

14:28.117 --> 14:29.576
Yes.

14:31.453 --> 14:32.871
ALARIC:
You're right.

14:33.455 --> 14:34.497
It's a match.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.708
This is from a crawl space in the foyer.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.335
Which means Meredith
knew where it was.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.338
That doesn't mean she stole it.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.799
This is from the loft.

14:45.301 --> 14:50.680
- These are from a duffle in Damon's car.
- Identical to the one that killed Brian.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.516
Damon's car was
at the Wickery Bridge fundraiser.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.476
So was Meredith.

14:55.644 --> 14:59.898
And that was the night her ex-boyfriend,
the medical examiner, was killed.

15:00.107 --> 15:01.816
The one who called her psycho.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.360
She was trying to save Bill Forbes.

15:05.529 --> 15:08.531
Why would she turn around
and try to kill him?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.534
I don't know what to think either,
you know, but...

15:12.244 --> 15:14.370
...we'd be idiots
to ignore all these facts.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.039
So, what should we do?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.916
Well...

15:22.046 --> 15:26.382
Get this to the police.
You should probably be with Caroline.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.887
I'm sorry, Ric.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.935
Please be careful.

ELIJAH:
Niklaus. Our guests have arrived.

15:49.907 --> 15:55.453
KLAUS: Damon. Stefan. Elijah tells me
you seek an audience. Very bold.

15:55.704 --> 15:59.248
Let's discuss the terms of our
agreement like civilized men, shall we?

15:59.458 --> 16:01.751
It's better to indulge him.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.838
I didn't, uh, come here to eat, Klaus.

16:06.006 --> 16:11.094
In fact, I didn't want to come here at all,
but I was told I had to.

16:11.303 --> 16:12.929
Because you would hear us out.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.472
[CHUCKLES]

16:14.765 --> 16:17.600
Well, we can sit and eat...

16:17.768 --> 16:22.605
...or I can reach down your throats
and pull out your insides.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.607
The choice is yours.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.785
Thank you, love.

16:36.704 --> 16:37.829
You lost your appetite?

16:39.039 --> 16:43.042
Eat. I thought we agreed that we would
leave the grumpy Stefan at home.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.383
KLAUS:
That's the spirit.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.469
Isn't this nice?
The four of us dining together.

16:53.637 --> 16:56.014
Such a treat.
Is this what you had in mind...

16:56.181 --> 16:57.849
...when you pulled the dagger out?

16:58.017 --> 17:02.729
Well, I knew how he felt about you,
so I figured the more, the merrier.

17:02.896 --> 17:06.065
KLAUS: Elijah and I have had quarrels,
but we always make it through.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.527
STEFAN:
Kind of like, uh, you and Rebekah, right?

17:09.694 --> 17:11.904
Where is she, by the way?

17:12.071 --> 17:16.325
Last I checked she was still daggered
because you were afraid to face her.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.329
If you're referring to the fact
that Rebekah knows I killed our mother...

17:20.497 --> 17:22.582
...I've already come clean to Elijah.

17:22.790 --> 17:25.084
Hey, Stef,
remember when you killed Dad?

17:26.211 --> 17:29.922
- Dial down the judgment till dessert.
- We're here to make a deal, Damon.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.258
Doesn't mean we need to kiss his ass.

17:32.426 --> 17:36.596
I'm just saying, we have a long evening
ahead of us, pace yourself.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.100
So did you heard back from Tyler yet?

17:41.935 --> 17:45.521
No. And I've left messages
for him everywhere.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.860
So does Alaric really think
that Dr. Fell did it?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.112
He doesn't know what to think.

17:54.448 --> 17:56.866
- What about you?
- Heh.

17:58.368 --> 18:03.122
I wish the girl Alaric liked
wasn't in the middle of all this.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.292
He deserves to be happy.

18:07.461 --> 18:12.632
But, yeah, she looks guilty.
That's why I told your mom.

18:17.596 --> 18:21.140
My mom's in there sitting with my dad.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.184
[LAUGHS]

18:23.352 --> 18:29.315
I don't think they've been in the same
room this long since I was 10 years old.

18:39.451 --> 18:41.577
Is there any chance that Tyler did it?

18:43.497 --> 18:45.832
- What?
- If Klaus was trying to mess with you...

18:45.999 --> 18:49.252
...and he's sired to Klaus and...

18:49.586 --> 18:52.672
...I mean,
he does everything that he's told.

18:52.881 --> 18:58.344
No. No, I don't think Tyler did it.

19:01.348 --> 19:03.015
I can't just let my father die.

19:03.517 --> 19:05.476
I'm gonna force him to feed.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.437
ELENA:
Hey.

19:10.399 --> 19:13.025
He doesn't want to, Caroline.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.116
The only thing your dad has
is his choice.

19:23.704 --> 19:27.165
I hated him so much
for what he did to me.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.500
So much.

19:31.628 --> 19:34.213
Now all I wanna do is save his life.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.049
Of course you do. He's your dad.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.062
What was the hardest part for you?

19:50.230 --> 19:52.315
When you lost your dad?

19:52.983 --> 19:55.985
Realizing all the things
that he wouldn't be there for.

19:57.863 --> 20:03.409
The things that, um,
you just need your dad for, you know?

20:27.601 --> 20:31.938
Hey.

20:43.617 --> 20:46.786
Stefan, where is the lovely
Elena tonight?

20:46.995 --> 20:48.537
I don't know. Ask Damon.

One more word about Elena
and, uh, this dinner is over.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.926
DAMON: Hey, you know what?
Probably best just to keep Elena...

21:02.094 --> 21:04.136
...in the do-not-discuss pile.

21:04.304 --> 21:07.223
KLAUS: You're probably right.
- Yeah.

21:07.766 --> 21:13.104
It's just the allure of the
Petrova doppelgänger is still so strong.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.897
What do you say, brother?

21:15.065 --> 21:18.609
- Shall we tell them about Tatia?
- Now, why should we discuss matters...

21:18.777 --> 21:20.987
...long since resolved?

21:21.154 --> 21:23.990
KLAUS: Given their shared affection
for both Elena and Katerina...

21:24.157 --> 21:28.452
...our guests might be curious to learn
about the originator of the Petrova line.

21:28.620 --> 21:32.331
DAMON: We're not going
anywhere, Elijah. Please.

21:32.541 --> 21:34.292
Do tell.

21:34.835 --> 21:38.004
When our family first settled here,
there was a girl named Tatia.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.299
She was an exquisite beauty.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.343
Every boy of age desired
to be her suitor.

21:44.511 --> 21:48.014
Even though she'd had a child
by another man.

21:48.181 --> 21:49.807
None loved her more than Niklaus.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.977
Oh, I'd say there was one
who loved her at least as much.

21:53.145 --> 21:58.482
Wait a minute.
So you both loved the same girl?

22:00.610 --> 22:03.571
Our mother was a very powerful witch.

22:04.156 --> 22:09.035
She sought to end our feud over Tatia
and so she took her.

22:09.202 --> 22:12.163
Klaus and I would learn
it was Tatia's blood we consumed...

22:12.331 --> 22:14.874
...on the night where our
mother performed a spell...

22:15.083 --> 22:16.959
...which turned us into vampires.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.755
Tatia wouldn't make a decision
between the two of us...

22:20.922 --> 22:25.509
...so for a time,
Niklaus and I grew estranged.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.513
Harsh words were traded. We even
came to blows, didn't we, brother?

22:29.681 --> 22:34.018
But in the end, we recognized
the sacred bond of family.

22:34.186 --> 22:39.690

to have powers.

23:18.188 --> 23:20.940
I had all those dreams for a reason.

The spirits wanted me to find you
because you're my mom.

You won't open yourself up to it.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.748
Do you know Dad never talked
about you?

23:39.709 --> 23:41.919
Neither did Grams.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.797
I had no memories of you.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.924
So you know what I used to pretend?

23:47.092 --> 23:49.301
That you were dead.

23:49.761 --> 23:54.890
It was easier to do that
than to wonder...

23:56.268 --> 23:58.477
...why you never came back for me.
