AN AUTO REPAIR SHOP.

FOR THE FAINT OF HEART.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.710
SO IF I FAINT, THAT'S WHY.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.685
UH, A WEEK AGO,
THE HEADLESS BODY

02:40.720 --> 02:42.381
OF 20-YEAR-OLD LILY CHANG

02:42.430 --> 02:44.819
WAS DISCOVERED
IN A PLAYGROUND
IN ROXBURY,

02:44.860 --> 02:48.853
THEN TWO DAYS AGO
45-YEAR-OLD DENISE WAGNER

02:48.900 --> 02:50.720
WAS DISCOVERED
IN THE NORTH END.

02:50.770 --> 02:54.467
HER BODY, SANS HEAD,
WAS LEFI' ON AN OLD COUCH
BY THE CURB.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.263
THE NORTH END
AND ROXBURY

02:56.310 --> 02:57.208
ARE TWO DISTINCT
NEIGHBORHOODS
IN BOSTON.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.401
THEY'RE ONLY 5.1 MILES
APART GEOGRAPHICALLY,

02:59.440 --> 03:00.702
BUT THEY'RE WORLDS APART

03:00.740 --> 03:02.571
IN TERMS OF RACIAL
AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC MAKEUP.

03:02.610 --> 03:05.408
DID THE WOMEN LIVE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS
WHERE THE BODIES WERE FOUND?

03:05.450 --> 03:06.712
NO. LILY LIVED ACROSS
OVER IN CAMBRIDGE,

03:06.750 --> 03:08.240
AND DENISE WAS FROM
BEACON HILL.

03:08.280 --> 03:10.589
WELL, THE UNSUB
MUST HAVE USED A VAN
OR OTHER VEHICLE

03:10.620 --> 03:11.917
TO TRANSPORT THE BODIES.

03:11.950 --> 03:15.408
NOT TO BE INDELICATE,
BUT ANY SIGN OF THE HEADS?

03:15.460 --> 03:16.256
NO, NOTHING YET.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.428
HE DUMPED THE BODIES
IN PUBLIC,

03:29.470 --> 03:30.937
SO HE OBVIOUSLY
WANTS THEM FOUND.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.608
BUT WHY?
WHAT'S THE ENDGAME?

BETWEEN THEM, I'M NOT SEEING IT.

LILY CHANG, WAS A CHEMISTRY
MAJOR AT M.I.T.

05:43.640 --> 05:46.632
SHE WAS LAST SEEN
TUTORING KIDS IN
AN AFI'ERSCHOOL PROGRAM.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.476
DENISE WAGNER WAS A BANKER,

05:47.510 --> 05:49.068
DIVORCED, LIVED
WITH HER TEENAGE SON.

05:49.110 --> 05:51.544

05:51.580 --> 05:53.741
CUTTING OFF SOMEONE'S HEAD
ISN'T EASY.

05:53.780 --> 05:55.714
WHY PICK THAT METHOD
TO KILL?

05:55.750 --> 05:56.978
TERRORIST GROUPS OFI'EN
USE BEHEADINGS

05:57.020 --> 05:58.578
TO SEND A MESSAGE
OR A WARNING.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.383
HISTORICALLY IT'S BEEN
USED FOR THAT PURPOSE,

06:00.420 --> 06:01.682
STARTING WITH THE ANCIENT
GREEKS AND ROMANS.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.052

06:04.090 --> 06:05.785
WAS INTRODUCED BY
WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR.

06:05.830 --> 06:07.559
AND OF COURSE THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE WERE BEHEADED

06:07.600 --> 06:08.726
DURING THE FRENCH
REVOLUTION,

06:08.760 --> 06:10.398
INCLUDING LOUIS XVI
AND MARIE ANTOINETTE.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.762
COULD THE BE THE WORK OF
A TERRORIST CELL ON U.S. SOIL?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.563
NONE HAVE CLAIMED
RESPONSIBILITY.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.409
SO WHAT'S HE DOING
WITH THE HEADS?

06:16.440 --> 06:18.067
HE COULD BE KEEPING THEM
AS HUMAN TROPHIES,

06:18.110 --> 06:19.737
OR LIKE JEFFREY DAHMER
AND DENNIS NILSEN,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.099
HE MIGHT HAVE PARTIALISM
AND HE'S USING THEM

06:21.140 --> 06:22.801
FOR HIS SEXUAL GRATIFICATION.

06:22.850 --> 06:24.408
OR THEY COULD BE GIVING HIM
A SENSE OF OWNERSHIP

06:24.450 --> 06:25.747
OVER HIS VICTIMS.

06:25.780 --> 06:26.576
MAYBE HE'S GOT
AN EXAGGERATED FEAR

06:26.620 --> 06:28.576
OF FEMALE REJECT ION
AND A SEVERED HEAD

06:28.620 --> 06:29.780
CAN'T TALK BACK
OR SAY NO.

06:29.820 --> 06:32.755
THOSE ARE ALL VALID THEORIES,
BUT WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES,

06:32.790 --> 06:33.711
WHY IS HE KILLING NOW?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.581

OF A THIRD HEADLESS WOMAN

06:36.630 --> 06:37.483
WAS FOUND IN BOSTON.

ON A BENCH
IN BOSTON COMMON.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.063

07:22.940 --> 07:24.635
DOES THE FBI HAVE ANY LEADS?
WHERE ARE THE HEADS?

07:24.670 --> 07:25.932
NO COMMENT.

07:25.970 --> 07:28.677

07:30.050 --> 07:31.472

07:31.510 --> 07:33.046
THIS IS DR. SPENCER REID.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.115
WHO FOUND HER?

07:34.150 --> 07:35.811
COUPLE OF TEENAGERS.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.943
MY PARTNER BROUGHT THEM
DOWN TO THE STATION.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.787
BET THEY WISH THEY
HADN'T CUT SCHOOL TODAY.

07:39.820 --> 07:41.788
CUTTING OFF

07:41.820 --> 07:43.856
WICKED BRUTAL
IF YOU ASK ME.

07:43.890 --> 07:46.552
IT'S ALSO MESSY.
BUT THERE'S MINIMAL BLOOD HERE.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.953
SAME AS THE FIRST
TWO CRIME SCENES.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.797
THE UNSUB MOST LIKELY
HAS A SECLUDED PLACE

07:49.830 --> 07:52.492
TO DO HIS WORK
BEFORE DISPLAYING THE BODIES.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.963
BRUISING AND SWELLING
ON BOTH THEIR HANDS.

07:55.000 --> 07:56.968
MAYBE SHE TRIED
TO FIGHT HIM OFF.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.535
WELL, IT DOESN'T APPEAR
SHE WAS DRAGGED
THROUGH THE GRASS,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.901
SO THE UNSUB OBVIOUSLY
HAS THE STRENGTH
TO CARRY THE BODY.

08:01.940 --> 08:03.669
WITHOUT THE HEAD,
THE BODY WOULD BE
A LOT LIGHTER.

08:03.710 --> 08:05.143
NOT NECESSARILY.
THE AVERAGE ADULT HUMAN HEAD

08:05.180 --> 08:06.943
ONLY WEIGHS APPROXIMATELY
10 POUNDS.

08:06.980 --> 08:09.141
WELL, WE HAD A CANINE UNIT
OUT SEARCHING FOR HERS.

08:09.180 --> 08:10.989
DID YOU FIND ANY
PERSONAL EFFECTS?

08:11.020 --> 08:12.510
LIKE THE FIRST TWO
VICTIMS,

08:12.560 --> 08:13.982
HE LEI-T THE JEWELRY
IN HER BAG,

08:14.020 --> 08:14.816
MONEY AND CREDIT CARDS.

08:14.860 --> 08:15.986
WHAT ABOUT A CELL PHONE?

08:16.020 --> 08:16.987
WE DIDN'T FIND ONE.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.679
I THINK THEY'RE BURN MARKS,

08:18.730 --> 08:19.992
MOST LIKELY FROM TASER PRONGS.

08:20.030 --> 08:21.725
THE OTHERS HAD 'EM, TOO.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.523
WELL, IT'S GOTTA BE HOW
HE OVERWHELMS HIS VICTIMS.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.299
HE'S GETTING CLOSE ENOUGH
TO MAKE CONTACT.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.139
YEAH, BUT HOW?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.530
Man: I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

09:06.940 --> 09:09.033
SHE'S IN HERE.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.343
CUT LOOKS CLEAN, SURGICAL.

09:19.390 --> 09:23.053
AS IF AMY'S HEAD
WAS TAKEN OFF
WITH A SINGLE BLOW.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.921
DO YOU NEED TO HAVE
A MEDICAL BACKGROUND
TO DO THIS?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.895
NOT NECESSARILY,
BUT YOU'D NEED SOMETHING
RAZOR SHARP

09:27.930 --> 09:29.124
TO ACHIEVE THIS PRECISE
A WOUND.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.264
THE UNSUB WOULD NEED
A POWERFUL SWING,

09:31.300 --> 09:32.836
NOT TO MENTION
GREAT AIM.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.758
JJ: IT LOOKS LIKE
HER KNUCKLES ARE BROKEN.

09:34.800 --> 09:38.065
THEY ARE. THE OTHER VICTIMS
HAVE THE SAME INJURY.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.608
DEFENSIVE WOUNDS, POSSIBLY,

09:45.650 --> 09:48.949
OR THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO PUNCH THEIR WAY
OUT OF SOMEPLACE.

09:48.980 --> 09:51.778
IN THAT INSTANCE,
OTHER BONES IN THE HANDS
WOULD HAVE BEEN BROKEN,

09:51.820 --> 09:53.981
BUT THESE WOUNDS ARE
LOCALIZED TO THE KNUCKLES.

09:54.020 --> 09:56.079
LIKE THEY WERE REPEATEDLY
HIT WITH SOMETHING.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.621
PREMORTEM TORTURE.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.628
HE'S PUNISHING THEM
BEFORE HE BEHEADS THEM.

09:59.660 --> 10:01.252
NOW, THE SECOND VICTIM,
DENISE WAGNER,

10:01.300 --> 10:03.291
HAS THE SAME PRECISE
SEVERED NECK.

10:03.330 --> 10:06.959
HOWEVER, THE BEHEADING
OF LILY CHANG IS
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.228
HOW SO?

10:10.810 --> 10:14.007
SEE HOW JAGGED AND FRAYED
THE SKIN LIGAMENTS
ARE CARTILAGE ARE?

10:14.040 --> 10:17.100
THAT'S AN INDICATION
THAT THE KILLER USED
A SAWING MOTION

10:17.150 --> 10:18.845
BACK AND FORTH
TO REMOVE HER HEAD.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.974
SHE'S THE FIRST VICTIM.
HE'S LEARNED SINCE
WHAT WORKS BEST.

10:22.020 --> 10:25.046
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
THAT THE WOMEN
WERE DRUGGED OR SEDATED,

10:25.090 --> 10:26.284
WHICH MEANS THAT THEY...

10:26.320 --> 10:28.083
WERE AWAKE
WHILE IT WAS HAPPENING.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.052
I'M AFRAID SO.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.920
HERE YOU GO, MR. GIBB.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.325
THANK YOU.

10:38.330 --> 10:39.968
WHEN THE POLICE CALLED,

10:40.000 --> 10:43.163
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEONE
PLAYING A SICK JOKE.

10:45.340 --> 10:49.106
THEN THEY CAME TO
THE HOUSE AND SAID THEY
FOUND AMY'S WALLET...

10:49.140 --> 10:52.303
MR. GIBB, IF YOU COULD
TELL US ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER,

10:52.350 --> 10:55.171
IT MIGHT HELP
OUR INVESTIGATION.

10:57.790 --> 11:01.009
AMY WAS...

11:01.060 --> 11:04.086
SHE'S EVERYTHING
A PARENT
COULD HOPE FOR.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.920
OH, SHE WAS SMART.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.896
AND BEAUTIFUL.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.160
AND KIND.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.228
SHE LIT UP EVERY ROOM
JUST BY WALKING IN.

11:21.780 --> 11:24.772
BUT THERE WERE
SOME PROBLEMS?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.889
SHE'D BEEN
A LITTLE LOST LATELY.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.808
LOST? HOW SO?

11:31.850 --> 11:34.216
UH...SHE WAS DEPRESSED.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.049
MY WIFE, AMY'S MOTHER,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.056
SHE DIED A FEW MONTHS AGO.

11:42.100 --> 11:43.897
THEY WERE VERY CLOSE.

11:45.170 --> 11:48.059
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU TALKED TO YOUR DAUGHTER?

11:48.100 --> 11:49.738
WELL, IT WAS LAST NIGHT.

11:49.770 --> 11:53.171
UH, SHE, UH,
WAS ON HER WAY HOME
FROM WORK.

11:53.210 --> 11:54.234
WHERE'S THAT?

11:54.280 --> 11:57.841
JENSEN'S. IT'S A RESTAURANT
IN THE SEAPORT DISTRICT.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.816
SHE CALLED ME FROM
THE T AT MIDNIGHT.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.180
I TOLD HER I DIDN'T LIKE
HER TAKING IT SO LATE,

12:08.220 --> 12:09.380
BUT SHE'S SAY
I WORRIED TOO MUCH.

12:09.420 --> 12:12.856
I TOLD HER THAT'S
MY JOB, YOU KNOW?

12:14.800 --> 12:17.189
YEAH...

12:17.230 --> 12:19.164
I KNOW.

12:20.800 --> 12:22.336
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

12:22.370 --> 12:26.101
SIR, THE LIST OF MEN
IN BOSTON WITH
A HISTORY OF SEX CRIMES

12:26.140 --> 12:28.108
IS LONG, DISTURBINGLY SO.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.074
BUT NONE OF THEM
WITH A NOGGIN FETISH.

12:30.110 --> 12:32.943
WHAT DID GPS TELL YOU ABOUT
THE VICTIMS' CELL PHONES?

12:32.980 --> 12:33.810
UH, AMY'S PHONE

12:33.850 --> 12:37.217
LAST PINGED
AT HER FRONT DOOR IN FENWAY.

12:37.250 --> 12:39.115
LILY AND DENISE'S PHONES

12:39.150 --> 12:41.482
EACH STOPPED PINGING
ON DIFFERENT STREETS
IN SOUTH BOSTON.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.385
Lawlor:
WE LOCALS CALL IT SOUTHIE.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.183
Garcia: HERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S THE SAME
ACROSS THE BOARD.

12:46.230 --> 12:49.199
ALL 3 WOMEN, MINUTES BEFORE
THEIR CELL PHONES DIED,

12:49.230 --> 12:50.822
THEY WERE TALKING
ON THE PHONE.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.259
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHO THOSE VICTIMS
SPOKE TO LAST.

12:53.300 --> 12:54.858
COPY THAT.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.333
AMY WORKED
AT THE SEAPORT.
THAT'S IN SOUTHIE.

12:56.370 --> 12:58.258
SO WAS THE SCHOOL
WHERE LILY TUTORED

12:58.310 --> 13:00.835
AND THE CONVENTION
CENTER WHERE DENISE
ATTENDED A SEMINAR.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.007
IT COULD BE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

13:03.050 --> 13:05.143
YOU KNOW, SOUTHIE'S STILL
PREDOMINANTLY WORKING-CLASS
IRISH-AMERICAN.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.273
HOWEVER, LONG-TIME RESIDENTS
THERE ARE STRUGGLING
TO HOLD ON

13:07.320 --> 13:10.244
TO THEIR HOMES AND
TRADITIONS IN THE FACE
OF GENTRIFICATION.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.987
FANCY WORD FOR ORGANIC
GROCERY STORES, CONDOS,
AND JUICE BARS.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.385
AMY TOOK THE T
ABOUT ABOUT MIDNIGHT.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.978
THE UNSUB COULD HAVE
FOLLOWED HER HOME.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.827
IF LILY AND DENISE
ALSO TOOK THE TRAIN,

13:18.860 --> 13:20.293
MAYBE THAT'S WHERE
HE GRABBED THEM.

13:20.330 --> 13:23.265
HE USED A TASER.
TOO RISKY IN THE SUBWAY.

13:23.300 --> 13:25.393
AMY COULDN'T HAVE TAKEN
THE T AT THAT TIME.
SERVICE WAS SHUT DOWN.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.399
BUT ARTHUR GIBB SAID
HE SPOKE TO HER THERE.
GARCIA?

13:28.440 --> 13:32.137
AND HE DID. GPS CONFIRMS
THAT AMY WAS AT THE STATION.

13:32.170 --> 13:33.876
BUT DETECTIVE LAWLOR
IS CORRECT.

13:33.910 --> 13:35.377
RIGHT Al-TER AMY ARRIVED,

13:35.410 --> 13:38.504
SERVICE ON THAT LINE
WAS DISRUPTED
DUE TO A TRACK FIRE.

13:38.550 --> 13:40.017
WHERE DID AMY GO
AI-TER THAT?

13:40.050 --> 13:42.041
I HAVE HER MOVING AWAY
FROM THE STATION,

13:42.080 --> 13:44.014
ARRIVING AT HER HOUSE
20 MINUTES LATER.

13:44.050 --> 13:45.142
THAT'S WHEN THE SIGNAL DIES.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.441
MAYBE SHE TOOK
THE BUS HOME?

13:46.490 --> 13:48.879
IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN HER
LONGER THAN 20 MINUTES.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.888
GARCIA, DID SHE CALL
A TAXI OR CAR SERVICE?

13:50.930 --> 13:54.388
SHE DID. SHE ORDERED A CAR
FROM A RIDE-SHARE COMPANY
CALLED ZIMMER,

13:54.430 --> 13:56.352
BUT SHE CANCELED IT
MINUTES LATER.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.995
SO HOW DID AMY GET HOME?

14:09.010 --> 14:11.046
WAIT, WAIT. HEY, HEY, HEY!

14:14.980 --> 14:17.380
LISTEN, I'LL PAY CASH
AND DOUBLE THE TIP

14:17.420 --> 14:20.389
IF YOU DRIVE ME
TO DORCHESTER.
NAME YOUR PRICE.

14:20.420 --> 14:24.982
THE CAR I ORDERED
IS 10 MINUTES AWAY
AND I GOTTA GET HOME.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.021
GET IN.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.527
YES!

14:35.000 --> 14:39.061
MAN, YOU JUST SAVED MY LIFE.
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.001
AMY GIBB'S FATHER
SAID SHE WAS DEPRESSED

14:43.050 --> 14:44.972
AND A LITTLE LOST
AI-TER HER MOTHER DIED,

14:45.010 --> 14:46.375
BUT WHAT HE DIDN'T MENTION
IS THAT A MONTH AGO

14:46.410 --> 14:48.048
SHE GOT CAUGHT
FOR SHOPLII-TING.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.308
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN
A DIRECT CORRELATION

14:49.350 --> 14:50.647
BETWEEN SHOPLII-TING
AND DEPRESSION.

14:50.690 --> 14:54.319
IT'S OI-TEN A REACTION
TO SOME KIND OF LOSS
OR NEED TO FILL A VOID.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.112
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THE SECOND VICTIM,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.628
DENISE WAGNER, JUST
HAD HER ASSETS FROZEN
BY THE S.E.C.

14:58.660 --> 15:00.958
DUE TO ALLEGATIONS
OF INSIDER TRADING.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.298
ANYTHING HINKY
ON THE FIRST VICTIM?

15:03.330 --> 15:04.524
LILY CHANG'S TRANSCRIPTS
SHOW THAT SHE WAS

15:04.570 --> 15:07.494
ON ACADEMIC PROBATION
FROM M.I.T. AND CLOSE
TO FLUNKING OUT.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.633
WELL, I TAKE BACK WHAT I SAID
ABOUT NOT SEEING A CONNECTION

15:09.670 --> 15:12.639
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS.
ALL 3 WERE INVOLVED
IN UNETHICAL SITUATIONS

15:12.670 --> 15:14.035
THEY PROBABLY
WEREN'T PROUD OF.

15:14.080 --> 15:15.934
[BEEP]
HELLO, G-MEN AND G-WOMAN.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.299
HEY, WHAT UP, BABY GIRL?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.012
OK, I HAVE BEEN DOING
RESEARCH ON SUPER-SHARP

15:20.050 --> 15:21.244
POSSIBLE
HEAD-CHOPPING WEAPONRY.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.043
WHAT'D YOU FIND?

15:23.090 --> 15:25.149
[SIGHS] THERE ARE SO MANY
WAYS TO SLICE AND DICE.

15:25.190 --> 15:27.158
AXES, MACHETES, KNIVES, SWORDS.

15:27.190 --> 15:30.079
DO YOU KNOW THERE'S
A SWORD FROM ASIA
CALLED THE KATANA?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.984
IT CAN SLICE A PERSON
IN HALF.
WHO WOULD NEED THAT?

15:32.030 --> 15:34.157
COULD BE WHAT
THE UNSUB'S USING.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.952
WELL, IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS,
IN BOSTON,

15:36.000 --> 15:39.128
THERE HAVE BEEN 20 SWORDS
SOLD, BOTH REAL AND REPLICAS,

15:39.170 --> 15:40.990
MOSTLY TO BUYERS WHO JUST
WANTED TO ADD THEM

15:41.040 --> 15:42.268
TO THEIR PRIVATE COLLECTIONS.

15:42.300 --> 15:43.631
WELL, WHO ELSE
BOUGHT THEM?

15:43.670 --> 15:46.059
UH, PEOPLE LIKE MOI
WHO GO TO RENAISSANCE FAIRS

15:48.340 --> 15:50.171
DON'T JUDGE ME.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.041
I'M NOT, BUT WE'RE GONNA
NEED TO TALK TO EVERYONE,

15:52.080 --> 15:53.274
SO SEND US THE INFORMATION.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.174
DONE AND DONE
AND DONE AND DONE.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.211
YOU KNOW, THE UNSUB'S
METHOD OF KILLING

15:57.250 --> 15:59.184
HAS CERTAINLY EVOLVED
SINCE THE FIRST KILL,

15:59.220 --> 16:02.109
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S USING
ANY OF THE WEAPONS
THAT GARCIA FOUND.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.253
WHAT ABOUT THE KATANA?
THAT CAN SEVER A NECK
WITH PRECISION.

16:04.290 --> 16:08.021
IT WOULD GIVE HIM
THE EFFICIENCY AND
ACCURACY WE'VE SEEN, BUT...

16:08.060 --> 16:09.652
WHAT? WHAT ARE
YOU THINKING?

16:09.700 --> 16:11.395
DISPLAYING THE BODIES
IN PUBLIC

16:11.430 --> 16:13.068
SEEMS TO BE WHAT'S
IMPORTANT TO THE UNSUB.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.239
HE WANTS TO MAKE AN EXAMPLE
OUT OF HIS VICTIMS,

16:15.270 --> 16:18.159
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
HE'S USING A GUILLOTINE.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.666
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

16:19.710 --> 16:22.076
GUILLOTINES WERE ONCE
CONSIDERED INSTRUMENTS
OF JUSTICE.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.543
EXECUTIONS WERE PUBLIC EVENTS.

16:23.580 --> 16:26.378
CROWDS WOULD COME AND LITERALLY
BRING PICNIC BASKETS.

16:26.410 --> 16:28.116
PARENTS WOULD BRING
THEIR KIDS.

16:28.150 --> 16:30.186
NOW, HE CAN'T KILL
IN TODAY'S TOWN SQUARE,

16:30.220 --> 16:31.482
SO HE'S DOING
THE NEXT BEST THING.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.011
HE'S DUMPING THE BODIES
FOR THE PUBLIC TO FIND.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.051
OK, GUILLOTINES
AREN'T EXACTLY

16:36.090 --> 16:38.422
SOMETHING YOU SEE
BEING SOLD ON AMAZON
EVERY DAY.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.098
NO, BUT IT WOULD BE
SO EASY TO MAKE ONE.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.757
ALL YOU NEED IS WOOD,
ROPE, PULLEYS,
AND SHEET METAL

16:41.800 --> 16:44.268
FROM THE LOCAL
HARDWARE STORE.

16:46.270 --> 16:49.194
NO, I'M FINE, REALLY.

16:49.240 --> 16:51.435
SOME OUT OF THE WAY HOTEL
IN SOUTHIE.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.779
MY WIFE THINKS
I WAS MEETING A CLIENT
AI-TER WORK.

16:53.810 --> 16:59.168
NO, I DON'T THINK
SHE SUSPECTS.

16:59.210 --> 17:02.816
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
CURTIS, IT WON'T.

17:02.850 --> 17:05.546
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO.

17:05.590 --> 17:09.287
HEY, THIS ISN'T THE WAY
TO DORCHESTER.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.421
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:13.460 --> 17:15.121
WHY ARE WE STOPPING?

17:15.160 --> 17:16.229
HEY, WHERE THE HELL ARE WE?

17:16.260 --> 17:17.818
AAH! AAH!

17:17.870 --> 17:19.462
AAH!

17:24.110 --> 17:25.099
LIKE AMY GIBB,
THE FIRST TWO VICTIMS

17:25.140 --> 17:27.131
HAD CALLED FOR RIDE-SHARE
CARS AND THEN CANCELED.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.431
TO ME, THIS WHOLE
RIDE-SHARE THING'S

17:28.480 --> 17:31.301
NOT MUCH DIFFERENT
THAN HITCHHIKING,

17:31.350 --> 17:33.079
EXCEPT YOU GOTTA PAY.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.576
I GET THE APPEAL.
IT'S QUICK AND EASY.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.838
YOU JUST HAVE TO ENTER
YOUR LOCATION
VIA SMARTPHONE.

17:36.880 --> 17:39.246
RIGHT. AND THEN SOME
RANDOM CAR PULLS UP
AND YOU HOP IN.

17:39.290 --> 17:40.609
THAT SOUNDS SAFE.

17:40.660 --> 17:41.854
WELL, RIDERS ARE SENT
THE DRIVER'S NAME,

17:41.890 --> 17:45.189
PHOTO, LICENSE PLATE
NUMBER. THEY KNOW
WHO'S PICKING THEM UP.

17:45.230 --> 17:46.424
MAYBE THE VICTIMS
DIDN'T WANT TO WAIT

17:46.460 --> 17:48.724
FOR THEIR RIDE-SHARE
CARS TO ARRIVE
AND HAILED A TAXI INSTEAD.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.194
AND IF THE CABBIE
HAD A JAMMER,
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

17:51.230 --> 17:52.561
WHY THE VICTIMS'
PHONE SIGNALS DIED.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.489
HE COULD BLITZ ATTACK THEM
IN THE CAB AND THEN
DISABLE THEIR PHONES.

17:55.540 --> 17:57.861
EXCEPT AMY WAS
AT HER FRONT DOOR WHEN
HER CELL SIGNAL DIED.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.107
TAXI DRIVERS DON'T
USUALLY ESCORT PASSENGERS
TO THEIR DOOR.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.778
MAYBE THIS ONE DID FOR AMY.

18:02.810 --> 18:04.869
JJ: WALKING PASSENGERS
TO THEIR DOOR

18:04.910 --> 18:06.741
FEELS MORE LIKE SOMETHING
A RIDE-SHARE DRIVER WOULD DO

18:06.780 --> 18:08.270
IN HOPES OF GETTING
A POSITIVE REVIEW.

18:08.320 --> 18:09.810
Lewis: LET'S GO FIND OUT.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.254
ZIMMER DRIVERS GO THROUGH
RIGOROUS BACKGROUND CHECKS.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.429
DOES THAT INCLUDE
FINGERPRINT-BASED
BACKGROUND CHECKS

18:18.460 --> 18:19.757
THROUGH THE DOJ
AND FBI SYSTEMS

18:19.790 --> 18:21.758
LIKE TAXI COMPANIES
ARE REQUIRED TO DO?

18:21.800 --> 18:22.721
NO.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.899
WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL
SEX OFFENDER DATABASE?

18:24.930 --> 18:27.831
WE LEAD THE INDUSTRY
WITH OUR SCREENING PROCESS.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.895
WE'RE EVEN ABOUT
TO INTRODUCE AN APP
FOR CHILDREN

18:29.940 --> 18:31.805
WHOSE PARENTS ARE
TOO BUSY TO SHUTTLE
THEM AROUND.

18:31.840 --> 18:34.536
HOW DO YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM DRIVER?

18:34.580 --> 18:36.275
NEGATIVE CUSTOMER REVIEWS.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.278
TOO MANY AND YOUR ACCOUNT
IS SUSPENDED

18:38.310 --> 18:40.312
OR PERMANENTLY DEACTIVATED.

18:40.350 --> 18:43.478
BUT ZIMMER ISN'T RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE CONDUCT
OF ITS DRIVERS.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.613
AND WHY IS THAT?

18:45.650 --> 18:47.618
THEY'RE INDEPENDENT
CONTRACTORS.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.323
SO IF A DRIVER
WERE TO KIDNAP ME
OR GET DRUNK

18:51.360 --> 18:54.158
AND DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE
WITH ME SITTING
RIGHT NEXT TO HIM,

18:54.200 --> 18:56.259
YOU'RE CLAIMING
ZIMMER'S NOT RESPONSIBLE.

18:56.300 --> 18:58.666
A BIT DRAMATIC, BUT TRUE.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.498
ZIMMER IS MERELY
A TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM

19:01.540 --> 19:04.202
THAT MATCHES WILLING
DRIVERS AND PASSENGERS.

19:04.240 --> 19:06.936
WHAT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO HACK
YOUR RIDE-SHARE APP?

19:06.970 --> 19:09.177
THEY COULD BE PICKING UP
PASSENGERS

19:09.210 --> 19:11.474
BEFORE THEIR ACTUAL DRIVERS
EVER ARRIVE.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.843
YOUR ZIMMER APP WAS HACKED.

19:14.880 --> 19:17.815
WE HAD SOME TROUBLE
RECENTLY.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.386
WHEN?

19:20.390 --> 19:21.857
LAST WEEK.

19:21.890 --> 19:24.222
BUT OUR CYBER-SECURITY
TEAM WAS ABLE TO TRACE IT

19:24.260 --> 19:27.798
TO A RIVAL COMPANY
TRYING TO POACH
OUR CUSTOMER BASE.

19:45.610 --> 19:47.544
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:47.580 --> 19:50.811
OW! [MOANING]

19:53.260 --> 19:55.455
OF ALL THE CARS
YOU COULD HAVE GOT INTO,

19:55.490 --> 19:56.957
YOU GOT INTO MINE.

19:56.990 --> 20:00.892
SOME MIGHT SAY
THAT LUCK OR FATE
BROUGHT US TOGETHER.

20:03.470 --> 20:07.793
[SIGH] I LIKE TO THINK
THAT IT WAS DIVINE INTERVENTION.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.603
IT'S TIME WE GET STARTED.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.868
OH, NO, NO.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.581
OH, NO, NO, NO.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.918
IF THE UNSUB'S NOT HACKING
RIDE-SHARE APPS,

20:26.950 --> 20:29.612
THEN WHAT'S TO STOP HIM
FROM SIMPLY POSING
AS A DRIVER?

20:29.660 --> 20:31.924
I MEAN, ALL HE'D HAVE
TO DO IS THROW A DECAL
ON A CAR WINDOW

20:31.960 --> 20:33.825
AND CRUISE AROUND
TARGET-RICH ENVIRONMENTS

20:33.860 --> 20:35.623
LIKE RESTAURANTS,
CLUBS, AND BARS.

20:35.660 --> 20:37.628
YEAH, HE COULD JUST
PRETEND THERE WAS
A PROBLEM WITH THE APP

20:37.670 --> 20:39.467
AND THEN OFFER A DISCOUNT
IF THE RIDER PAYS CASH

20:39.500 --> 20:40.899
AND CANCELS THE CAR
THEY ALREADY ORDERED.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.329
MM-HMM.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.337
I LOVE YA!

20:44.370 --> 20:45.769
HEY, BABY GIRL, LISTEN.

20:45.810 --> 20:47.277
I NEED YOU TO LOOK
AT JOB APPLICATIONS

20:47.310 --> 20:48.800
SUBMITTED BY
RIDE-SHARE DRIVERS.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.775
THAT IS A TALL ORDER,
MY FAVORITE FLAVOR
OF HOT CHOCOLATE.

20:51.810 --> 20:53.619
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO GIVE ME
UN POQUITO MAS.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.777
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE APPLY
FOR THOSE JOBS EVERY DAY.

20:55.820 --> 20:58.288
WELL, FIND LOCAL DRIVERS
WHO WERE REJECTED.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.912
YEAH, ALSO CHECK FOR
CURRENT RIDE-SHARE
DRIVERS IN THE AREA

20:59.950 --> 21:03.920
WITH CRIMINAL HISTORIES
THAT DATE BACK PRIOR
TO 7 YEARS AGO.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.929
RIGHT. BECAUSE BACKGROUND
CHECKS OI-TEN DON'T GO
THAT FAR BACK.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.689
OK, I'LL CATCH YOU
ON THE FLIPSIDE.

21:08.730 --> 21:11.995
WELL, IT'S TIME
TO GIVE THE PROFILE.

21:12.030 --> 21:14.863
THE UNSUB WE'RE LOOKING FOR
MAY BE A RIDE-SHARE DRIVER

21:14.900 --> 21:18.563
OR POSING AS ONE
AND IS USING THAT SERVICE
TO HUNT FOR HIS VICTIMS.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.963
HE APPEARS
NON-THREATENING,

21:20.010 --> 21:22.308
WHICH ALLOWS HIM
TO GET CLOSE
TO HIS VICTIMS.

21:22.340 --> 21:23.944
THE SOPHISTICATED
NATURE OF HIS PLANNING

21:23.980 --> 21:26.073
SUGGESTS HE'S IN HIS
LATE 305 OR EARLY 40$.

21:26.110 --> 21:27.941
WE THINK HE'S
AN INJUSTICE COLLECTOR,

21:27.980 --> 21:31.643
UPSET BY WHAT HE CONSIDERS
TO BE THE UNFAIRNESS
OF HIS LIFE.

21:31.690 --> 21:32.941
HE HOLDS ON TO GRUDGES,

21:32.990 --> 21:35.686
AND HE MAGNIFIES SLIGHTS
WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

21:35.720 --> 21:38.757
HIS HYPERSENSITIVITY
COULD BE THE RESULT
OF PARANOIA

21:38.790 --> 21:40.326
OR DRUG-INDUCED PSYCHOSIS.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.499
RIDE-SHARE COMPANIES
USE SOFTWARE AND PHONE APPS

21:42.530 --> 21:44.669
TO TRACK THE DRIVERS
AND CUSTOMERS.

21:44.700 --> 21:46.497
COULD HE BE HACKING
THEIR SYSTEMS?

21:46.530 --> 21:48.839
WE'VE CHECKED EVERY RIDE-SHARE
COMPANY OPERATING IN BOSTON.

21:48.870 --> 21:50.098
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF THAT.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.005
HOWEVER, HE MAY BE GETTING
AROUND THE SOFTWARE

21:52.040 --> 21:54.531
BY PICKING HIS VICTIMS
OFF THE APP,

21:54.580 --> 21:56.070
SIMILAR TO WHEN
CONVENTIONAL TAXI DRIVERS

21:56.110 --> 21:57.577
GO OFF THE METER.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.407
EVEN THE MOST MINOR INSULT

21:59.450 --> 22:02.544
COULD CAUSE HIM TO FLY INTO
A MURDEROUS RAGE.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.081
Lewis: HE COULD ALSO
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN A HOME

22:04.120 --> 22:05.883
WHERE HE WAS EXCESSIVELY
DISCIPLINED.

22:05.920 --> 22:06.784
AAH!

22:06.820 --> 22:08.981
JJ: THE ACT OF STRIKING
HIS VICTIMS' HANDS

22:09.020 --> 22:10.681
MAY BE PART
OF THEIR PUNISHMENT.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.880
Rossi: AND THE BEHEADING
PROBABLY GIVES HIM THE POWER

22:12.930 --> 22:15.421
AND CONTROL
HE FEELS HE LACKS.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.564
THE PUBLIC IS ADVISED
TO TRAVEL IN PAIRS OR GROUPS

22:17.600 --> 22:19.659
AND TO USE PUBLIC
TRANSPORTATION
WHEN POSSIBLE.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.998
IF USING A TAXI,
PLEASE CALL THE COMPANY

22:22.040 --> 22:23.962
TO ORDER ONE IN LIEU OF
HAILING ONE IN THE STREET.

22:24.010 --> 22:25.034
AND IF YOU'RE A RIDE-SHARE
CUSTOMER,

22:25.070 --> 22:26.537
MAKE SURE THE CAR
THAT PICKS YOU UP

22:26.570 --> 22:27.935
IS THE ONE
THAT YOU RESERVED

22:27.980 --> 22:29.868
AND THE DRIVER
MATCHES THE PHOTO
THAT WAS SENT TO YOU.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.502
IF HE'S UPSET ABOUT CHANGES
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

22:31.550 --> 22:33.916
HE MIGHT CONSIDER
OUTSIDERS TO BE THE ENEMY

22:33.950 --> 22:36.874
AND HIS FORM OF PUNISHMENT
IS DECAPITATION.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.888
THANK YOU.

22:38.920 --> 22:41.013
AGENTS, THERE'S A WOMAN HERE,

22:41.060 --> 22:43.881
SHE'S CONVINCED THAT HER
HUSBAND'S BEEN KIDNAPPED
BY THE KILLER.

22:43.930 --> 22:47.081
UP TO NOW, THE UNSUB'S
ONLY BEEN ABDUCTING
AND BEHEADING WOMEN.

22:47.130 --> 22:48.950
SHE'S BEING
PRETTY INSISTENT.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.865
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET
A LOT MORE LIKE HER
COMING IN HERE.

22:50.900 --> 22:54.028
SHE ALSO MENTIONED
HER HUSBAND'S A FREQUENT
USER OF RIDE-SHARE.

22:54.070 --> 22:55.094
JJ, LEWIS, CHECK IT OUT.

23:02.110 --> 23:04.078
HE'S GONNA
CHOP OFF HIS HEAD!

23:04.110 --> 23:06.840
I SAW THE NEWS.
I KNOW THAT THE BEHEADER
HAS MY HUSBAND.

23:06.880 --> 23:09.212
MRS. SIMMONS,
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

23:13.090 --> 23:15.115
WILL YOU TELL ME
WHY YOU THINK THIS?

23:15.160 --> 23:17.014
ANTHONY DIDN'T COME HOME
LAST NIGHT.

23:17.060 --> 23:18.152
HE'S NEVER NOT COME HOME

23:18.190 --> 23:20.124
IN THE 10 YEARS
THAT WE'VE BEEN MARRIED.

23:20.160 --> 23:23.049
OK, WHEN DID YOU LAST
SPEAK WITH HIM?

23:23.100 --> 23:25.864
YESTERDAY AFTERNOON.
UM, HE SAID THAT
HE HAD A CLIENT DINNER

23:25.900 --> 23:29.063
AND THAT HE'D BE HOME LATE.
BUT HE NEVER CAME HOME.

23:29.100 --> 23:32.831
YOU TOLD THE POLICE
THAT YOUR HUSBAND USED
RIDE-SHARE SERVICES?

23:32.870 --> 23:36.806
YES. ALL THE TIME.
UM, IT'S THE ONLY WAY
HE GETS AROUND THE CITY.

23:36.840 --> 23:40.105
HE LOST HIS LICENSE
AFTER A DUI.

23:40.150 --> 23:43.039
WHERE WAS THIS DINNER
LAST NIGHT?

23:43.080 --> 23:45.219
CHINATOWN.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.115
CHINATOWN'S
NOWHERE NEAR SOUTHIE.

23:47.150 --> 23:49.948
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.

23:49.990 --> 23:53.187
BUT YOU'RE GOING
TO INVESTIGATE, RIGHT?

23:53.230 --> 23:55.448
SO, ARE WE DEALING
WITH A NUTCASE

23:55.500 --> 23:57.092
OR IS THE WIFE
ONTO SOMETHING?

23:57.130 --> 23:59.018
I'M HOPING GARCIA
CAN TELL US.

23:59.070 --> 24:01.038
GARCIA'S THE NAM E,
SERVICE THE GAME.

24:01.070 --> 24:04.107
HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR INFORMATION
ON AN ANTHONY SIMMONS.

24:04.140 --> 24:05.209
HE LIVES IN DORCHESTER.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.901
MM-HMM. ANTHONY J.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.635
428 NELSON COURT.
FIRE WHEN READY.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.808
OK, UH, HE HAD DINNER
WITH A CLIENT IN CHINATOWN
LAST NIGHT.

24:11.850 --> 24:14.114
ANYTHING TO SHOW HE WAS THERE?

24:14.150 --> 24:15.913
NO. I DON'T THINK
HE WAS DOING THAT.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.248
THERE ARE NO CREDIT CARD
RECORDS OF ANY BARS
OR RESTAURANTS

24:18.290 --> 24:19.939
IN CHINATOWN FOR HIM.

24:19.990 --> 24:22.151
WAS HE ANYWHERE
NEAR SOUTHIE?

24:22.190 --> 24:24.681
OH, HE WAS ALL OVER THAT
LIKE A CHEAP POLY-RAYON
BLEND SUIT.

24:24.730 --> 24:27.119
I HAVE HIM CHECKING
TO A HOTEL CALLED THE MARQUEE.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.957
HE ORDERED ROOM SERVICE
FOR TWO--

24:29.000 --> 24:30.661
SHRIMP COCKTAIL, STEAK DIANE,
CREME BRULEE,

24:30.700 --> 24:33.260
3 BOTTLES OF CABERNET,
AND HE ALSO ORDERED

24:33.300 --> 24:36.497
AN IN-ROOM ADULT
ENTERTAINMENT MOVIE
ON PAY-PER-VIEW.

24:36.540 --> 24:39.100
I DON'T THINK HE'LL
BE ABLE TO PUT THAT
ON HIS EXPENSE ACCOUNT.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.176
DID HE USE
A RIDE-SHARE SERVICE?

24:41.210 --> 24:42.973
YEAH. HE USED A PLACE
CALLED VOYAGE

24:43.010 --> 24:44.238
FROM DOWNTOWN BOSTON
TO THE HOTEL.

24:44.280 --> 24:46.077
WHAT TIME DID HE CHECK OUT
THIS MORNING?

24:46.110 --> 24:47.839
HE DIDN'T. HE CHECKED OUT
THE SAME NIGHT

24:47.880 --> 24:49.711
AND HE ORDERED A ZIMMER CAR
TO DORCHESTER.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.945
I BET IT WAS CANCELED
MINUTES LATER.

24:51.990 --> 24:54.982
YOU ARE CORRECT.
HIS GPS SHOWS HIM
HEADING TO DORCHESTER

24:55.020 --> 24:56.510
AND THEN POOF, SIGNAL DIES.

24:56.560 --> 24:58.027
ALL RIGHT.
THANKS, PENELOPE.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.528
SO MRS. SIMMONS WAS
RIGHT ABOUT HER HUSBAND
BEING ABDUCTED

25:00.560 --> 25:03.051
BUT WRONG
ABOUT CHINATOWN.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.538
UHH'
[CLANG]

25:18.650 --> 25:21.016
AAH! AAH!

25:21.050 --> 25:22.972
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

25:23.020 --> 25:24.180
NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.189
PLEASE, WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS?

25:27.220 --> 25:28.881
WHO ARE YOU?

25:28.920 --> 25:30.285
WHO'S TANYA?

25:30.320 --> 25:32.720
HUH?

25:32.760 --> 25:35.126
I DON'T KNOW
WHO THAT IS.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.799

25:51.610 --> 25:55.979
OK, OK, WAIT!
TANYA--TANYA IS
A WOMAN FROM WORK.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.208
IS THIS ABOUT HER?

26:00.250 --> 26:01.285
[BREATHING HARD]

26:01.320 --> 26:02.355
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

26:02.390 --> 26:05.223
GOD, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.227
ADMIT IT.

26:06.260 --> 26:07.921
ADMIT WHAT?

26:07.960 --> 26:09.257
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HER NAME?

26:09.300 --> 26:12.326
I LOOKED. YOU CALL
AND TEXT HER A LOT.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.930
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
THE OTHERS.

26:14.970 --> 26:16.938
YOU TALK ON YOUR PHONE,

26:16.970 --> 26:19.302
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE IN
SOME KIND OF PRIVATE
LITTLE BUBBLE,

26:19.340 --> 26:20.876
BUT YOU ARE NOT.

26:20.910 --> 26:23.208
YOU HEARD...

26:23.240 --> 26:24.946
CON FESS!

26:26.210 --> 26:27.871
YOU'RE HAVING SEX WITH TANYA!

26:30.280 --> 26:32.680
I'M NOT.

26:32.720 --> 26:35.109
I SWEAR.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.788

26:40.090 --> 26:41.819

26:41.860 --> 26:43.157
NO, NO, NO, NO--

26:43.200 --> 26:46.192
AAH!

26:52.770 --> 26:54.169
ALL RIGHT,
THANK YOU SO MUCH. BYE.

26:54.210 --> 26:55.336
DID YOU FIND OUT?

26:55.380 --> 26:56.301
LILY CHANG'S
CLASSMATE SAID

26:56.340 --> 26:58.001
THAT THEY THEY WERE TRYING
TO BUY AN ANSWER KEY

26:58.050 --> 26:59.642
TO AN UPCOMING CHEMISTRY
MIDTERM.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.342
DENISE WAGNER
WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH A CANADIAN BANKER

27:02.380 --> 27:04.985
WHO WAS HELPING HER
SET UP AN OFFSHORE ACCOUNT

27:05.020 --> 27:06.942
IN, UH, VANUATU?

27:06.990 --> 27:08.355
THE REPUBLIC
OF VANUATU.

27:08.390 --> 27:10.210
IT'S A TAX HAVEN
KNOWN FOR
ITS BANKING SECRECY.

27:10.260 --> 27:12.057
IT APPEARS SHE'D BEEN
SIPHONING OFF MONEY

27:12.090 --> 27:13.387
FROM HER CLIENTS FOR YEARS.

27:13.430 --> 27:14.556
WHAT ABOUT AMY GIBB?

27:14.600 --> 27:17.194
THE LAST PERSON
TO TALK TO AMY GIBB
WAS HER BEST FRIEND.

27:17.230 --> 27:18.367
SHE SAID THAT AMY
INVITED HER OVER

27:18.400 --> 27:20.732
TO DRINK A BOTTLE
OF CHAMPAGNE THAT
SHE STOLE FROM WORK.

27:20.770 --> 27:21.964
AND ANTHONY SIMMONS?

27:22.000 --> 27:24.309
HE LAST TALKED
TO A CURTIS PRICE,

27:24.340 --> 27:26.365
BUT HE HASN'T GOTTEN
BACK TO US YET.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.378
WHAT IF THE UNSUB KNEW ABOUT
WHAT HE CONSIDERED TO BE

27:28.410 --> 27:30.901
HIS VICTIMS' MORAL
TRANSGRESSIONS AND
HE WAS OFFENDED BY THEM?

27:30.950 --> 27:32.178
BUT HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT?

27:32.210 --> 27:33.871
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW PEOPLE
SPILL THEIR SECRETS

27:33.920 --> 27:36.241
TO BARTENDERS,
HAI RDRESSERS,

27:36.280 --> 27:38.339
THE STRANGER SITTING
NEXT TO THEM ON A PLANE.

27:38.390 --> 27:41.917
WHEN OUR PERSONAL SPACE
IS LIMITED, IT CAN TRIGGER
A FALSE SENSE OF INTIMACY.

27:41.960 --> 27:45.225
WELL, THE BACKSEAT
OF A TAXICAB IS Ol-TEN
LIKE A CONFESSIONAL.

27:45.260 --> 27:47.751
I IMAGINE IT'S LIKE THAT
WITH RIDE-SHARE CARS, TOO.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.893
THE VICTIMS COULD BE
CONFESSING THEIR WRONGDOINGS

27:49.930 --> 27:51.397
TO THE UNSUB
WHILE HE'S DRIVING.

27:51.430 --> 27:52.567
AND THEY COULD BE DOING IT
UNKNOWINGLY.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.239
HE COULD BE EAVESDROPPING,
AND DEPENDING ON WHAT HE HEARS,

27:55.270 --> 27:58.307
THEY GO FROM BEING A FARE
TO BEING A VICTIM.

28:03.410 --> 28:06.140
UHH! OH, GOD!

28:06.180 --> 28:07.738
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

28:07.780 --> 28:09.941
YOU CHEATED ON YOUR WIFE.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.242
THAT'S ADULTERY.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.453
YOU HEARD ME WRONG.
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX WITH TANYA.

28:14.490 --> 28:15.912
I WAS JUST JOKING, YOU KNOW?

28:15.960 --> 28:18.451
JUST GUY STUFF.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.720
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

28:20.760 --> 28:24.719

28:26.230 --> 28:28.767

28:28.800 --> 28:32.361
[BREATHING HARD, WHIMPERING]

28:32.410 --> 28:34.332
OHH...

28:34.380 --> 28:37.133
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

28:37.180 --> 28:38.977
ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.477
I DIDN'T DO IT.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.319
YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

28:42.350 --> 28:46.013
THAT'S WHAT THE GUILTY
ALWAYS SAY.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.779
BUT I CAN PROVE IT.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.524
JUST LET ME CALL
A BUDDY OF MINE.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.097
DO YOU THINK I'M STUPID?!

28:54.130 --> 28:55.825
NO.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.350
BUT HE'LL TELL YOU.

28:57.400 --> 28:59.868
I LOVE MY WIFE.
