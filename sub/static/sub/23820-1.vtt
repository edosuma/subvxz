01:33.959 --> 01:36.251
<i>The future belonged to him.</i>

01:36.876 --> 01:38.959
<i>He was respected worldwide,</i>

01:39.793 --> 01:43.084
<i>adored by Jean Renoir
as well as the Beatles,</i>

01:43.293 --> 01:45.626
<i>Fritz Lang and the Rolling Stones,</i>

01:46.126 --> 01:49.501
<i>unanimously regarded
as the most gifted of his generation.</i>

01:51.834 --> 01:54.084
<i>He was the Nouvelle Vague.</i>

01:54.543 --> 01:56.709
<i>Jean-Luc Godard.</i>

01:58.459 --> 02:01.543
<i>His very name
embodied a certain idea of Cinema.</i>

02:01.751 --> 02:05.293
<i>Indefinable, wild, fascinating,</i>

02:05.501 --> 02:09.126
<i>funny, unpredictable, disconcerting,</i>

02:09.334 --> 02:13.126
<i>political, charming, impertinent,</i>

02:13.334 --> 02:15.501
<i>young, free.</i>

02:19.334 --> 02:20.834
<i>And I loved him.</i>

02:21.043 --> 02:23.876
<i>I was lucky enough to admire my lover</i>

02:24.626 --> 02:26.543
<i>who had left a print on me.</i>

02:30.376 --> 02:35.084
<i>This man who had revolutionized film
10 years earlier,</i>

02:35.626 --> 02:37.501
<i>had shaken up my life too,</i>

02:38.251 --> 02:41.918
<i>and was about to revolutionize himself.</i>

02:54.709 --> 02:56.543
<i>I always knew she'd leave.</i>

02:57.084 --> 02:59.501
<i>I didn't know when, or how,</i>

02:59.959 --> 03:02.876
<i>or even why. But I was right.</i>

03:04.709 --> 03:07.001
<i>This girl, probably too beautiful,</i>

03:07.209 --> 03:09.459
<i>too young, too bourgeois,</i>

03:09.668 --> 03:11.126
<i>will soon be twenty.</i>

03:11.668 --> 03:13.084
<i>I'm in love with her.</i>

03:15.501 --> 03:18.668
<i>This image is in 1967,</i>

03:19.126 --> 03:20.959
<i>my first footage of her.</i>

03:21.834 --> 03:25.918
<i>The film is La Chinoise,
and she plays a Maoist student.</i>

03:26.876 --> 03:29.084
<i>In real life, she studies philosophy,</i>

03:29.293 --> 03:32.918
<i>she's the granddaughter
of a famous conservative author.</i>

03:34.043 --> 03:37.834
<i>Rebelling against her background,
youthfully carefree,</i>

03:38.043 --> 03:40.293
<i>she dared love a man like myself.</i>

03:41.001 --> 03:42.626
<i>Her name is Anne,</i>

03:42.834 --> 03:45.959
<i>and she's the one
who has decided to tell our story.</i>

03:46.876 --> 03:48.918
<i>Here she sees me as successful,</i>

03:49.126 --> 03:51.084
<i>confident and seductive,</i>

03:51.501 --> 03:54.043
<i>but I am no longer that Godard.</i>

03:55.084 --> 03:58.209
<i>Mozart died aged 35
and he got it right.</i>

03:58.751 --> 04:02.209
<i>Artists should die at 35
before becoming old farts.</i>

04:04.209 --> 04:07.334
<i>In a few months, I'll turn 37.</i>

04:10.459 --> 04:11.584
So are you pleased?

04:11.793 --> 04:14.001
Very. Anne is wonderful,

04:14.209 --> 04:16.834
she brings spontaneity and youth
to the film,

04:17.043 --> 04:18.459
I'm amazed.

04:19.209 --> 04:20.959
You amaze me, Anne.

04:21.834 --> 04:23.418
No really, I'm thrilled.

04:23.626 --> 04:26.334
I'm planning a Chinese tour
after Avignon.

04:27.001 --> 04:29.751
The Chinese are going to love the film.

04:31.793 --> 04:34.043
You'll be a revolutionary icon.

04:35.001 --> 04:37.584
Mauriac's granddaughter lauded by Mao…

04:38.376 --> 04:40.168
And your grandfather?

04:40.376 --> 04:41.543
Is he aware of the movie?

04:41.751 --> 04:44.001
No. But he can say what he likes.

04:44.209 --> 04:46.084
I'm proud to do this film.

04:46.959 --> 04:50.418
If he can't see that:
tough, Nobel prize or not.

04:51.168 --> 04:54.168
I adore him,
but I'm in love with Jean-Luc.

04:54.376 --> 04:56.334
He must accept that.

04:56.543 --> 04:58.168
All that and only 19!

04:58.918 --> 05:01.959
- So are you going to America?
- After shooting.

05:02.418 --> 05:03.876
Harvard first,

05:04.334 --> 05:07.793
I'm giving a lecture,
then 2 days in New York.

05:08.251 --> 05:10.626
Only two days in New York? Pity.

05:10.834 --> 05:13.834
It's not New York Pity,
it's New York City.

05:18.293 --> 05:22.543
And Anne must study,
she's back at university next year.

05:23.043 --> 05:25.668
I want her
to get a good political education.

05:27.584 --> 05:29.001
She's an actress now.

05:29.209 --> 05:32.084
Actress…
I'm not sure it's a real job.

05:32.293 --> 05:33.626
Real actors are dumb.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.084
They're beneath contempt.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.043
They cry and laugh on demand,

05:38.251 --> 05:39.709
even crawl…

05:39.918 --> 05:41.626
I find that grotesque.

05:42.334 --> 05:43.959
They aren't free.

05:45.126 --> 05:48.751
If you tell one to say actors are dumb,
I bet he'll do it.

05:49.376 --> 05:51.584
<i>SHEILA, HAPPY AT LAST</i>

06:43.793 --> 06:46.876
<i>Here, silence is the rule.</i>

06:47.876 --> 06:51.001
<i>Like a huge, Grey metal whale,</i>

06:51.209 --> 06:55.084
<i>the submarine Le Redoutable,
launched today, March 29th,</i>

06:55.293 --> 07:01.001
<i>imposes its silent supremacy
at a depth of several hundred meters…</i>

07:01.418 --> 07:03.959
<i>Calmness and serenity reign</i>

07:04.168 --> 07:07.084
<i>in this 128 meter-long cylinder.</i>

07:12.543 --> 07:16.584
<i>135 submariners
are given missions of 70 days.</i>

07:16.793 --> 07:20.543
<i>They must not be claustrophobic,
and need hard heads:</i>

07:21.918 --> 07:23.668
<i>in the maze of staircases</i>

07:23.876 --> 07:26.918
<i>ceilings are low, corridors narrow,</i>

07:27.126 --> 07:29.084
<i>and obstacles numerous.</i>

07:30.626 --> 07:34.751
<i>To stay sane, and to carry out
their mission successfully,</i>

07:34.959 --> 07:39.376
<i>the men must philosophically
accept the daily nuisances.</i>

07:41.501 --> 07:43.126
<i>Everyone mucks in,</i>

07:43.876 --> 07:46.876
<i>and the many leisure activities</i>

07:47.084 --> 07:50.043
<i>are aimed at maintaining
the high morale.</i>

07:55.751 --> 07:59.626
<i>An anticyclone of 1028/1000 bars</i>

07:59.834 --> 08:01.543
<i>is spreading to the east of France</i>

08:01.751 --> 08:02.918
<i>with little change.</i>

08:03.126 --> 08:05.626
<i>The south west Atlantic current</i>

08:05.834 --> 08:09.584
<i>is still moving to the north
of Ireland and Scotland.</i>

08:11.293 --> 08:12.126
Hello.

08:19.459 --> 08:21.543
<i>A revolutionary creature,</i>

08:21.751 --> 08:23.334
<i>the Redoutable submarine</i>

08:23.543 --> 08:27.543
<i>glides along peacefully,
conscious of its strength.</i>

08:28.209 --> 08:30.043
<i>Although ready to attack,</i>

08:30.251 --> 08:34.833
<i>it is distinguished by its calmness.</i>

08:36.708 --> 08:40.333
<i>Such is life
on board the Redoutable.</i>

08:44.918 --> 08:48.876
"Such is life
on board the Redoutable."

08:55.918 --> 08:57.626
This is unbelievable!

08:58.126 --> 08:58.793
What?

08:59.001 --> 09:03.209
The births column:
A Mr & Mrs Me have had a daughter,

09:04.168 --> 09:05.334
they've called her Mary.

09:06.709 --> 09:07.751
Mary Me?

09:07.959 --> 09:09.168
Yes, my darling.

09:09.376 --> 09:10.751
Marry me.

10:53.376 --> 10:55.584
<i>On the contrary
To be pro the cons</i>

10:55.793 --> 10:57.751
<i>Always never agreeing</i>

10:58.834 --> 11:00.251
Shall we go out?

11:00.876 --> 11:02.293
To do what?

11:03.376 --> 11:05.751
Just go out, like everyone else.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.834
Just because everyone does?

11:08.043 --> 11:10.334
You know what that's called?

11:10.543 --> 11:12.209
Alienation.

11:12.418 --> 11:16.251
Well I'm like everyone,
and it won't stop me living.

11:16.459 --> 11:18.918
Very spiritual.
But unlike you,

11:19.126 --> 11:22.084
I don't feel I have to be like everyone.

11:22.293 --> 11:25.418
I don't have to,
precisely because I'm living.

11:25.626 --> 11:28.251
Look, I feel like walking backwards,

11:29.043 --> 11:30.126
so I will.

11:30.334 --> 11:33.043
I like doing what other people don't do,

11:33.751 --> 11:37.376
everything which isn't allowed,
or isn't the done thing.

11:38.126 --> 11:40.251
Precisely because no-one does it.

11:40.459 --> 11:43.876
Apart from you,
the great Jean-Luc Godard.

11:44.084 --> 11:45.626
I know what you like.

11:45.834 --> 11:47.251
You do?

11:47.918 --> 11:49.584
I know what interests you.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.709
You want to live

11:53.959 --> 11:55.376
like they do in the movies.

11:55.918 --> 11:57.043
That's impossible.

11:57.668 --> 12:01.168
In real life, people forget their keys,
catch buses…

12:01.376 --> 12:03.834
There's no voice-over saying

12:04.043 --> 12:06.126
"Anne loved Jean-Luc."

12:06.334 --> 12:07.876
That doesn't happen.

12:08.418 --> 12:09.876
You do other things,

12:10.084 --> 12:12.959
you eat, see a movie, go shopping.

12:13.168 --> 12:15.709
But if you love me, it's different,

12:15.918 --> 12:18.043
you do things differently.

12:18.251 --> 12:20.584
You don't need a voice-over.

12:21.293 --> 12:22.959
<i>Anne loved Jean-Luc</i>

12:23.168 --> 12:24.626
<i>but he talked too much.</i>

12:24.834 --> 12:29.334
<i>At times she was surprised
by his desire to be different.</i>

12:30.459 --> 12:32.084
<i>As her friends said,</i>

12:32.293 --> 12:34.251
<i>she'd picked an oddball.</i>

12:36.334 --> 12:38.834
What are you doing? You're not ready?

12:42.626 --> 12:43.959
<i>Halt amigo!</i>

12:44.168 --> 12:47.126
<i>It won't do you any good.
There's 3 of us.</i>

12:47.584 --> 12:48.584
<i>Hey you!</i>

12:48.793 --> 12:52.751
<i>You know you got a face beautiful
enough to be worth $2000?</i>

12:55.001 --> 12:56.126
<i>Yes,</i>

12:57.918 --> 13:01.043
<i>but you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.</i>

13:01.751 --> 13:03.626
<i>Come on amigo, a couple steps back.</i>

13:06.959 --> 13:09.334
MAO'S ALL GREEK TO ME

13:09.543 --> 13:11.001
<i>Alice in Swann's Way.</i>

13:11.209 --> 13:12.876
<i>Don't mess with the 40 thieves.</i>

13:13.084 --> 13:14.834
<i>Ali Babe and Virginia Woolf.</i>

13:15.043 --> 13:16.876
<i>Love and a Country priest.</i>

13:17.084 --> 13:19.334
<i>24 hours in 80 days.</i>

13:19.543 --> 13:21.293
<i>1001 Midsummer Nights' Dream.</i>

13:21.501 --> 13:23.376
<i>Rise of the 3 Little Pigs.</i>

13:23.584 --> 13:24.876
You lose!

13:25.334 --> 13:27.459
<i>- 3 Little Pigs isn't a book.
- Really?</i>

13:27.668 --> 13:30.001
What is it then? An opera?

13:30.209 --> 13:32.168
No. A fairy tale. Not a book.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.876
You always change the rules.

13:36.918 --> 13:39.709
Yes I do. So?

13:48.334 --> 13:51.043
The advantage
of Marxist-Leninist rhetoric:

13:51.251 --> 13:53.418
it gets you out of anything.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.626
<i>In spite of La Chinoise,</i>

13:56.834 --> 13:58.626
<i>my bourgeois education kept me</i>

13:58.834 --> 14:01.126
<i>far from Mao's aphorisms</i>

14:01.959 --> 14:04.376
<i>and General Lin Bao's analyses.</i>

14:05.834 --> 14:09.626
<i>Jean-Luc had finally been invited
to the Chinese Embassy</i>

14:09.834 --> 14:13.501
<i>to arrange the film's tour of China.</i>

14:15.751 --> 14:17.168
Hello my love.

14:26.668 --> 14:27.834
Are you OK?

14:28.543 --> 14:29.793
No.

14:30.001 --> 14:32.334
The Chinese said my film was shit.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.168
What? Which Chinese?

14:35.751 --> 14:38.668
Which Chinese…
I have no idea which Chinese!

14:38.876 --> 14:40.334
I didn't catch their names.

14:40.543 --> 14:43.626
Chinese names are very complicated.

14:44.293 --> 14:46.418
The Chinese at the Embassy.

14:47.334 --> 14:48.668
Oh no.

14:49.126 --> 14:50.668
You said it.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.918
What did they say?

14:55.751 --> 14:59.043
They said it was the work
of a reactionary imbecile,

14:59.251 --> 15:01.293
I misunderstood the revolution,

15:01.501 --> 15:03.751
and that if they could,

15:04.293 --> 15:06.793
they'd ban the title of the film.

15:07.418 --> 15:09.418
Those Chinese are crazy!

15:09.626 --> 15:11.626
Stop with the Chinese!

15:11.834 --> 15:13.584
They aren't the problem…

15:14.001 --> 15:15.418
Sorry.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.501
I suppose the tour…

15:20.084 --> 15:24.376
Well, the tour will be limited
to the Avignon festival.

15:27.251 --> 15:28.876
Don't worry darling.

15:29.793 --> 15:31.293
I love your film.

15:31.501 --> 15:33.168
I'm proud to be in it.

15:34.418 --> 15:35.584
Yes I am.

15:36.126 --> 15:38.418
I'm sure plenty will love it.

15:38.626 --> 15:39.709
Really?

15:40.418 --> 15:42.084
I wonder who.

15:46.459 --> 15:47.793
Don't worry,

15:48.001 --> 15:50.918
such is life
on board the Redoutable.

15:52.668 --> 15:54.751
You got married in Switzerland?

15:54.959 --> 15:58.209
Is it true
you married Mauriac's granddaughter?

15:58.418 --> 16:01.334
Wait for the press conference!
We'll talk then.

16:02.376 --> 16:05.001
Like the Beatles.
We're not the Beatles.

16:05.209 --> 16:07.459
So Avignon is proud to welcome

16:07.668 --> 16:09.168
a world premiere,

16:09.376 --> 16:12.793
at the Palais des Papes,
for the first time ever

16:13.001 --> 16:14.459
film director Jean-Luc Godard.

16:14.668 --> 16:17.793
We are honored
to screen here in Avignon

16:18.001 --> 16:19.709
<i>his film: La Tonkinoise.</i>

16:19.918 --> 16:21.959
No. La Chinoise, Mr Vilar.

16:23.209 --> 16:24.376
<i>La Chinoise, sorry.</i>

16:25.793 --> 16:27.918
One question. You have just married

16:28.126 --> 16:30.876
Mauriac's granddaughter. The reaction?

16:31.084 --> 16:31.876
Of course,

16:32.084 --> 16:35.251
she was delighted,
she smiled, we kissed.

16:36.126 --> 16:38.751
I meant Frangois Mauriac's reaction.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.751
I know. Thank you.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.876
You don't want to reply or…?

16:44.084 --> 16:47.584
We're here to talk about art,
not showbiz gossip.

16:47.793 --> 16:49.376
Any questions

16:49.584 --> 16:52.668
must be about his film,
La Tonkinoise.

16:52.876 --> 16:54.501
- La Chinoise!
- What did I say?

16:55.168 --> 16:57.376
<i>- You said La Tonkinoise!
- Oh!</i>

16:57.584 --> 16:59.293
- It's impossible!
- Don't worry.

16:59.501 --> 17:01.876
Is it true you married in secret?

17:02.084 --> 17:06.209
<i>Please!
Only questions about La Chinoise!</i>

17:06.417 --> 17:08.167
<i>La Tonkinoise!</i>

17:10.167 --> 17:11.751
You're here to show

17:11.959 --> 17:16.209
a film which takes place
in Maoist circles.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.417
Are you a Maoist?

17:18.626 --> 17:20.001
If I am

17:20.792 --> 17:23.376
you'll want to know what Mauriac thinks?

17:24.459 --> 17:26.709
But are you a revolutionary?

17:26.917 --> 17:30.709
I'm for 100 flowers blooming
and 100 thoughts contending.

17:30.918 --> 17:31.793
A Mao thing?

17:32.001 --> 17:33.793
A Mao Tse thing.

17:35.626 --> 17:36.751
He's a jerk for example.

17:36.959 --> 17:39.626
What does Avignon mean for you?

17:40.334 --> 17:42.418
I'm glad to be here, with my wife.

17:43.084 --> 17:46.043
And I wanted to thank

17:46.251 --> 17:47.501
Hervé Vilar.

17:48.293 --> 17:49.876
Jean Vilar!

17:50.334 --> 17:52.876
- You're teasing me again!
- Exactly.

17:53.084 --> 17:54.501
Fair enough.

17:54.709 --> 17:57.043
<i>It's the Communist Party's fault.</i>

17:57.251 --> 18:00.168
<i>So we need to go
thousands of miles for our ideal.</i>

18:00.376 --> 18:01.584
<i>To Peking.</i>

18:02.418 --> 18:03.251
<i>Listen.</i>

18:04.293 --> 18:05.959
<i>Whatever his view,</i>

18:06.168 --> 18:09.584
<i>a communist cannot automatically treat</i>

18:10.334 --> 18:13.793
<i>the Chinese cultural revolution
as banal.</i>

18:14.001 --> 18:15.668
<i>As any other argument.</i>

18:15.876 --> 18:18.084
<i>It's unprecedented fact.</i>

18:18.293 --> 18:19.918
<i>And there's this:</i>

18:20.126 --> 18:22.584
<i>it's not about exporting the revolution,</i>

18:22.793 --> 18:24.751
<i>as it belongs to the Chinese,</i>

18:24.959 --> 18:28.334
<i>but its political lessons
concern us all.</i>

18:28.543 --> 18:29.876
<i>All communists.</i>

18:31.251 --> 18:32.959
<i>Answer it Guillaume!</i>

18:39.709 --> 18:43.376
<i>Vietnam is on fire
and I yell "Mao! Mao!"</i>

18:44.084 --> 18:47.293
<i>Johnson is laughing
and I'm high. Mao! Mao!</i>

18:47.501 --> 18:49.543
"It could have been a great film,

18:49.751 --> 18:52.751
"about tragedy, dreams and reality,

18:52.959 --> 18:57.001
"but that's just a cruel description,
sympathizing

18:57.209 --> 19:00.751
"with the foolishness
of bourgeois political puberty.

19:01.834 --> 19:05.376
"And when asked
how to change the world and revolt,

19:05.584 --> 19:09.126
"La Chinoise could have provided
a beautiful response.

19:09.709 --> 19:12.543
"With Godard,
it's just sickening platitudes.

19:12.751 --> 19:15.293
"We loathe the chattering classes

19:15.501 --> 19:17.876
"and their endless pathetic lecturing…"

19:23.709 --> 19:26.251
Well… it all goes on in the same vein.

19:26.459 --> 19:28.209
They don't like it either.

19:28.418 --> 19:29.959
Yes, but

19:30.168 --> 19:32.626
Les Lettres Frangaises loved it.

19:32.834 --> 19:34.668
Les Lettres Frangaises?

19:35.876 --> 19:39.501
- We wrote a good piece.
- But everyone knows we're pals.

19:39.709 --> 19:41.334
But what they say is good.

19:41.543 --> 19:43.126
Doesn't that count?

19:43.334 --> 19:45.334
That's not the point.

19:45.876 --> 19:47.209
I must accept my mistake.

19:47.709 --> 19:49.084
The Chinese,

19:49.293 --> 19:52.626
critics, students, Mao,
no-one likes the film.

19:53.251 --> 19:54.709
Not to mention the public…

19:54.918 --> 19:57.043
It's not that important.

19:57.251 --> 19:58.626
Well, it is in a way.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.293
Only the Commies like it.

20:00.501 --> 20:02.418
A perfect failure.

20:02.626 --> 20:04.334
I thought it was revolutionary,

20:04.543 --> 20:06.418
it's just conventional.

20:06.626 --> 20:08.043
Films aren't exciting.

20:08.251 --> 20:10.918
Actors, spotlights, stories, all dead.

20:11.126 --> 20:13.584
Today's cinema is dead,
I can't do it anymore.

20:13.793 --> 20:16.709
It'd be like
making love with a dead woman.

20:16.918 --> 20:18.418
You're being ridiculous!

20:18.876 --> 20:20.668
<i>You can't stop just for 3 jerks!</i>

20:20.876 --> 20:24.126
I agree! You're the talented one.
You're Godard.

20:24.334 --> 20:27.376
Stop saying that.
I'm not Jean-Luc Godard.

20:27.584 --> 20:31.168
He doesn't exist.
I'm just pretending to be Godard.

20:31.376 --> 20:34.334
I'm an actor playing Godard.

20:34.543 --> 20:37.793
Not even a particularly good actor.

20:44.084 --> 20:46.376
Let's go. We'll be late.

20:46.584 --> 20:47.793
Yes, let's go.

20:49.501 --> 20:51.209
I don't know what to do,

20:51.418 --> 20:53.084
it's very unsettling.

20:53.834 --> 20:57.709
Sometimes he doubts simple things,
like he forgets who he is.

20:59.251 --> 21:02.334
I just wish he'd enjoy
making films again.

21:02.543 --> 21:06.168
With charm and lightness,
which he does so well.

21:07.793 --> 21:10.543
I want to help him but…
I don't know how.

21:10.751 --> 21:12.751
Times are changing.

21:12.959 --> 21:16.334
In today's world,
lightness and charm…

21:17.168 --> 21:19.293
I feel he doesn't even want to.

21:19.501 --> 21:21.376
Or he doesn't like cinema any more.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.209
I don't think so.
Trust him, he's Godard.

21:24.418 --> 21:26.959
What else is he good at?

21:27.168 --> 21:29.084
He won't open a butcher's shop…

21:29.293 --> 21:31.709
You're right. I'm probably naive.

21:31.918 --> 21:33.084
Wait…

21:34.376 --> 21:36.751
- Are you OK, darling?
- Yes, carry on!

21:36.959 --> 21:39.626
The problem is I don't know what to do.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.376
I got La Chinoise wrong, that's all.

21:42.959 --> 21:45.334
I need to invent something new.

21:45.793 --> 21:47.043
True political cinema.

21:47.251 --> 21:49.876
- You've always been political.
- No I just pretended.

21:50.084 --> 21:52.626
I'm tired of amusing the middle class.

21:53.668 --> 21:57.043
Now I'd like to make a film
about the Canadian Indians

21:57.251 --> 21:59.418
refusing an oil well on their land.

21:59.626 --> 22:02.959
How do I turn that into cinema?
That's my question.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.751
Use Alain Delon
with a feather up his ass?

22:06.959 --> 22:09.459
No, but you do films. Not politics.

22:09.668 --> 22:11.751
Same thing. It's all political.

22:11.959 --> 22:15.043
Pretending it's not is bullshit.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.126
Opting out of politics
is a political choice.

22:19.793 --> 22:21.584
OK. But what about cinema?

22:21.793 --> 22:23.834
That's what Truffaut is for.

22:24.043 --> 22:27.959
Romantic films.
All people care about is love.

22:29.126 --> 22:32.126
As Guitry said,
it makes your heart weary.

22:33.834 --> 22:36.584
Enough of the dictatorship of sentiments.

22:36.793 --> 22:39.418
Sentiments don't make revolutions.

22:39.626 --> 22:42.626
- You believe in the revolution?
- Of course!

22:45.668 --> 22:48.418
I'll explain: politics is like shoes.

22:48.626 --> 22:52.834
There's left and right,
eventually you want to go barefoot.

22:54.126 --> 22:56.959
I think France
will soon want to go barefoot.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.126
- Well…
- Yes it will.

22:59.334 --> 23:02.876
If the workers wake up,
police and army will follow…

23:03.084 --> 23:04.418
It can happen fast.

23:07.959 --> 23:10.876
Shitting and farting soothe the stomach.

23:11.668 --> 23:12.793
Guitry again?

23:13.001 --> 23:15.043
No, that's Mao.

23:18.418 --> 23:20.626
JOIN THE ANGRY!

23:32.709 --> 23:34.126
Long live the revolution!

23:35.126 --> 23:39.376
<i>Jean-Luc was wrong about the workers,
the police and the army.</i>

23:39.876 --> 23:42.209
<i>But less than a year later,</i>

23:42.418 --> 23:44.459
<i>as sentiments were involved,</i>

23:45.001 --> 23:47.043
<i>the revolution came to Paris.</i>

23:47.584 --> 23:51.334
<i>At last Jean-Luc was in the right place,
at the right time.</i>

23:51.876 --> 23:54.918
<i>He felt in tune with the world.</i>

24:02.793 --> 24:04.626
De Gaulle is a shit pump!

24:04.834 --> 24:06.584
Pompidou is a shit pump!

24:06.793 --> 24:09.084
They're all shit pumps!

24:19.418 --> 24:21.751
Free our comrades!

24:21.959 --> 24:24.209
Free our comrades!

24:34.376 --> 24:36.334
Government must resign!

24:43.126 --> 24:45.584
Excuse me, are you Jean-Luc Godard?

24:47.376 --> 24:48.793
I knew it!

24:49.001 --> 24:52.209
When are you going to make
funny films again?

24:53.251 --> 24:56.959
When people can laugh in Vietnam,
Palestine and Yemen,

24:57.168 --> 25:00.584
or black people in America,
maybe then.

25:00.793 --> 25:02.334
Not for a while then.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.668
Who knows? Look around you…

25:06.876 --> 25:09.209
Do you only like funny films?

25:09.418 --> 25:13.293
No, but…
real life is not much fun as it is,

25:13.501 --> 25:15.084
so at the movies…

25:15.293 --> 25:18.001
Why should movies be different to life?

25:18.543 --> 25:20.751
Vietnam is part of your life, no?

25:20.959 --> 25:23.084
Don't the Kurds exist?

25:23.584 --> 25:25.376
OK, but you make movies,

25:25.584 --> 25:28.043
you're not Secretary of State.

25:29.251 --> 25:32.959
Maybe not, but I can take
an interest in people.

25:33.834 --> 25:36.918
But we want you to get
people interested.

25:37.126 --> 25:39.334
Before taking an interest in them.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.334
It's complicated talking to you.

25:49.251 --> 25:52.293
Stay close to me in these situations.

25:52.918 --> 25:54.084
I am close to you…

25:54.293 --> 25:56.501
That's what I said.

25:56.709 --> 25:57.793
We agree.

25:58.001 --> 26:01.126
De Gaulle resign!

26:08.751 --> 26:09.751
We're leaving!

26:09.959 --> 26:11.168
- What?
- We're off.

26:11.376 --> 26:13.209
See you later then.

26:13.418 --> 26:14.418
Not scared?

26:15.209 --> 26:16.626
Not at all.

26:16.834 --> 26:19.209
I think the atmosphere is great.

26:21.751 --> 26:23.709
Police: SS!

26:33.293 --> 26:35.918
Fucking fascists! Bastards!

26:38.418 --> 26:40.459
- Godard's not happy!
- I'm so angry!

26:40.668 --> 26:41.959
It shows!

26:42.793 --> 26:44.209
Are you OK darling?

26:44.418 --> 26:46.251
Police: SS!

27:16.293 --> 27:17.584
Motherfuckers!

27:42.418 --> 27:44.126
- OK?
- Yes!

27:53.209 --> 27:54.084
OK?

27:54.668 --> 27:56.376
- Yes.
- Need help?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.751
No, go on comrade.

27:58.959 --> 28:00.709
- OK?
- Yes.

28:00.918 --> 28:02.126
That really hurt.

28:02.334 --> 28:05.334
- Your glasses…
- They're screwed.

28:08.209 --> 28:11.959
- Does it still hurt?
- Yes, just the muscles seizing up.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.334
Oh shit…

28:16.376 --> 28:17.293
What?

28:21.584 --> 28:24.209
Sorry, I didn't recognize you
without your glasses.

28:26.043 --> 28:27.126
Pardon?

28:27.793 --> 28:29.751
No… do your job…

28:30.668 --> 28:33.209
My wife and I loved Contempt.

28:33.418 --> 28:35.209
Carry on the good work…

28:35.418 --> 28:36.543
Thank you.

28:40.251 --> 28:42.626
You actually said thank you?

28:43.209 --> 28:44.251
Well, yes…

28:44.459 --> 28:46.959
"Well yes"?
She says "well yes", too!

28:47.168 --> 28:48.334
Well what?

28:48.959 --> 28:51.168
Now it's "Well what"!
We're improving.

28:51.376 --> 28:54.584
Such progress.
From "well yes" to "well what".

28:54.793 --> 28:57.043
Why not make him a salad too?

28:57.626 --> 29:00.334
Never say thank you to a cop, OK?
Ever!

29:00.543 --> 29:03.543
Even if he helps you.
You never thank them.

29:03.751 --> 29:06.459
- So what should I say?
- Nothing!

29:06.668 --> 29:09.793
If you must speak,
say "Die, you piece of shit!

29:10.001 --> 29:13.293
<i>"I'll hang you by your balls
with the guts of the last priest."</i>

29:13.501 --> 29:15.459
That's all you should say!

29:15.668 --> 29:18.001
<i>Anger is adding to the tension,</i>

29:18.209 --> 29:20.084
<i>which has been rising all day.</i>

29:20.293 --> 29:22.043
<i>For the past 3 hours now</i>

29:22.251 --> 29:24.668
<i>students have occupied the boulevard,</i>

29:24.876 --> 29:26.959
<i>confronting the police.</i>

29:27.168 --> 29:29.376
<i>Over a thousand demonstrators</i>

29:30.084 --> 29:33.168
<i>just built a barricade from stones…</i>

29:34.001 --> 29:38.209
Sorry, the police have asked us
to pull down the shutters.

29:38.418 --> 29:40.084
- Why?
- The riots, madam.

29:40.918 --> 29:43.668
- What?
- Fighting in the neighborhood…

29:43.876 --> 29:46.834
- So you're obeying the police?
- Unbelievable.

29:47.043 --> 29:49.376
- It's OK, never mind.
- I'm sorry.

29:51.459 --> 29:55.168
You can order,
we just have to pull the shutter down.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.126
Good. Peace at last.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.251
What did he say?

30:04.209 --> 30:05.751
He said good.

30:05.959 --> 30:09.751
Then we won't hear those young idiots
playing at war.

30:12.209 --> 30:13.584
Asshole.

30:14.501 --> 30:15.501
Pardon?

30:17.751 --> 30:18.959
I said asshole.

30:19.168 --> 30:20.418
Very clever…

30:20.626 --> 30:22.376
You called us young idiots.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.251
You've proved me right.

30:24.459 --> 30:26.293
I'm proud to be a young idiot.

30:27.209 --> 30:29.793
Better than a traitor and his whore.

30:30.001 --> 30:31.751
My husband has a war medal!

30:31.959 --> 30:33.876
- I'm no traitor!
- You have medals?

30:34.084 --> 30:35.751
I fought in 2 wars!

30:35.959 --> 30:37.626
And look at the result!

30:38.126 --> 30:41.793
If you're still alive
you must have been hiding!

30:42.001 --> 30:45.793
You're lucky I'm too old
to teach you some respect.

30:46.001 --> 30:48.959
- Respect my ass.
- You little shit!

30:49.168 --> 30:51.293
That was totally uncalled for.

30:51.501 --> 30:54.001
You just called that old lady a whore.

30:56.126 --> 30:59.001
How could I know,
I don't have my glasses.

31:00.001 --> 31:03.209
Better to be a whore
than married to an asshole.

31:03.418 --> 31:04.751
Am I right, darling?

31:15.751 --> 31:19.209
Does a teacher exist
if his students negate him?

31:20.084 --> 31:21.668
He no longer exists!

31:21.876 --> 31:25.043
A boss doesn't exist
if the workers negate him.

31:25.668 --> 31:27.293
Same for the police!

31:27.834 --> 31:30.459
That's what we're doing here.

31:30.959 --> 31:33.543
We don't want things to stay the same,

31:33.751 --> 31:36.876
because as they are they're no good!

31:50.876 --> 31:53.501
Quiet!
I'm told Jean-Luc Godard is here.

31:53.709 --> 31:57.001
Where is he? We'd like him to speak.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.293
He's here!

31:59.501 --> 32:00.376
I'm here.

32:00.584 --> 32:01.918
Here Damien…

32:02.501 --> 32:04.001
We're bringing you a mike…

32:04.209 --> 32:07.084
<i>The director of Breathless. Contempt.</i>

32:08.334 --> 32:11.876
La Chinoise. I've not seen it
but I'm told it's very good.

32:17.251 --> 32:19.043
Thank you…

32:19.251 --> 32:22.126
I came here to listen.
But if you want me to speak…

32:23.334 --> 32:25.418
Well the thing is…

32:25.626 --> 32:30.793
I think the first question should be:
What is the revolution?

32:33.293 --> 32:35.168
Mao said "Revolution is a drama".

32:35.376 --> 32:37.834
MOVEMENT OF AN OBJECT

32:38.043 --> 32:39.459
Che Guevara said the same thing.

32:39.668 --> 32:42.251
AROUND A CENTRAL POINT

32:42.459 --> 32:44.334
"Create a Vietnam within us."

32:44.543 --> 32:47.584
BRINGING IT BACK PERIODICALLY

32:47.793 --> 32:49.584
Revolution starts with oneself!

32:49.793 --> 32:52.418
TO THE SAME POINT.

32:52.626 --> 32:54.418
As for me…

32:54.626 --> 32:56.668
"Me, me, me!"
It's always about you!

32:56.876 --> 32:58.543
Grow some balls Jean-Luc,

32:58.751 --> 33:00.084
instead of filming bullshit!

33:00.668 --> 33:02.293
Shut the fuck up!

33:03.084 --> 33:04.209
Quiet!

33:06.334 --> 33:08.293
Godard is a consumer product!

33:08.501 --> 33:09.668
Shut the fuck up!

33:09.876 --> 33:11.709
An accomplice of power!

33:11.918 --> 33:15.209
Just like Coca-Cola
or Mickey Mouse.

33:15.418 --> 33:16.334
That's what you are!

33:16.543 --> 33:17.626
Shut up!

33:18.209 --> 33:19.918
Quiet, please!

33:20.126 --> 33:21.251
You're no danger!

33:22.793 --> 33:24.793
You're pissing in the wind!

33:25.001 --> 33:26.043
Hey Godard!

33:26.251 --> 33:27.584
And my balls, you like them?

33:34.001 --> 33:35.376
What's wrong?

33:35.584 --> 33:36.876
Nothing.

33:37.084 --> 33:39.626
Why do you let them say those things?

33:39.834 --> 33:44.209
As soon as you're with a student
you lose all your confidence.

33:44.418 --> 33:46.709
You let them say anything.

33:49.751 --> 33:51.834
You're probably right.

33:53.043 --> 33:55.293
Maybe because he's young.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.959
He speaks from the heart so he's right.

33:58.543 --> 34:00.751
Even if he's wrong it doesn't matter.

34:02.543 --> 34:04.001
I don't like old people.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.251
So when the old guy is me…

34:09.168 --> 34:10.876
I don't like myself.

34:13.083 --> 34:17.333
<i>Deep down Jean-Luc liked
these young activists.</i>

34:18.418 --> 34:20.958
<i>They were political, witty,</i>

34:21.168 --> 34:22.918
<i>intelligent, arrogant,</i>

34:23.126 --> 34:25.668
<i>rowdy, incorrigible,</i>

34:25.876 --> 34:27.208
<i>pertinent,</i>

34:27.418 --> 34:29.126
<i>impertinent, caustic,</i>

34:29.793 --> 34:31.376
<i>subversive</i>

34:31.583 --> 34:33.001
<i>and young-</i>

34:33.876 --> 34:37.083
<i>Unfortunately
the activists despised Jean-Luc,</i>

34:37.751 --> 34:39.751
<i>and he agreed with them.</i>

34:40.668 --> 34:42.583
<i>He was at a dead-end.</i>

34:42.793 --> 34:44.376
<i>He had to change.</i>

34:44.583 --> 34:45.793
DANGEROUS LIAISONS

34:46.001 --> 34:47.668
It's not your films as such,

34:47.876 --> 34:51.668
it's just that
they're from another era.

34:51.876 --> 34:55.418
If we accept a revolution,
we must decide who we are.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.459
Either we're a cop, or a revolutionary.

34:58.959 --> 35:02.834
So either we make cop films
or revolutionary films.

35:03.043 --> 35:06.001
It's not about giving an account
of the revolution.

35:06.209 --> 35:07.293
It's about living it.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.543
Making films in a revolutionary way.

35:09.751 --> 35:13.293
Like workers freed from the patriarchy.

35:13.501 --> 35:15.584
It's not giving the workers a voice.

35:15.793 --> 35:17.543
The role of intellectuals now

35:17.751 --> 35:19.709
is to be a sounding board.

35:19.918 --> 35:22.501
Who is Jean-Luc talking to over there?

35:23.126 --> 35:24.209
He looks enthralled.

35:24.418 --> 35:26.501
J.P. Gorin, from Le Monde.

35:26.709 --> 35:29.376
- Le Monde des Livres.
- He's very young.

35:29.584 --> 35:31.709
A bit pedantic but charismatic.

35:31.918 --> 35:34.168
He worked with you on La Chinoise, no?

35:34.376 --> 35:35.626
As a consultant?

35:37.709 --> 35:38.959
Yes, but…

35:39.751 --> 35:42.168
it was mainly with Jean-Luc, I…

35:43.668 --> 35:44.543
Obviously.

35:51.501 --> 35:54.459
The problem is how to self-manage

35:54.668 --> 35:56.043
with a film crew.

35:58.876 --> 36:00.376
Do you want a drink?

36:00.584 --> 36:02.168
No thanks, my love.

36:02.376 --> 36:04.001
Sorry, carry on.

36:07.793 --> 36:12.501
Yes, I was saying the question is,
how do we apply the same line,

36:12.709 --> 36:14.293
for schools and factories,

36:14.501 --> 36:16.668
to a creative piece of work…

36:16.876 --> 36:18.084
Excuse me…

36:19.834 --> 36:23.293
Which implies an Author
with a capital

36:23.501 --> 36:25.876
but is also a group enterprise.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.418
So what do you do about power?

36:56.834 --> 36:59.584
Excuse me…
Who is that guy over there?

37:00.793 --> 37:02.959
A dancer. A very good one.

37:03.168 --> 37:06.334
A little cocksure, but very good.

37:09.418 --> 37:13.001
You're so annoying
when you idolize people like that.

37:13.209 --> 37:14.626
- Me?
- Oh please.

37:14.834 --> 37:17.793
You were staring at him,
practically drooling.

37:18.001 --> 37:21.376
You've got a nerve,
you hardly spoke to me at all.

37:21.584 --> 37:23.126
I was talking to Gorin.

37:23.751 --> 37:24.959
That's different.

37:25.418 --> 37:27.084
Not a ballerina!

37:28.376 --> 37:32.543
When you admire guys like that,
I wonder why you're with me…

37:33.626 --> 37:37.209
You're like a feather at the mercy
of the wind. Very reassuring.

37:44.709 --> 37:45.543
This way!

37:51.501 --> 37:52.876
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

37:53.084 --> 37:56.001
- Are you hurt?
- No, it's just my glasses.

37:56.209 --> 37:57.293
Where are they?

37:57.501 --> 38:00.543
On the ground probably.
I can't see a thing.

38:01.334 --> 38:02.709
I think they're here…

38:06.168 --> 38:07.709
I don't believe it.

38:08.543 --> 38:09.959
Now they've had it.

38:10.168 --> 38:12.043
Now they really are fucked.

38:17.001 --> 38:18.751
It's because of my shoes.

38:19.876 --> 38:22.959
I need some that don't slip when I run.

38:28.251 --> 38:30.334
They're very good, perfect.

38:30.543 --> 38:33.126
Thank you. I'll take them.

38:37.501 --> 38:39.626
Sorry for yesterday.

38:41.501 --> 38:42.959
It's OK.

38:44.959 --> 38:48.418
I didn't mean to make you jealous.

38:49.668 --> 38:51.084
But you ignored me.

38:54.459 --> 38:56.459
You need to be more independent,

38:59.001 --> 39:01.334
come out of your auto alienation.

39:02.168 --> 39:04.459
Especially as I was with Gorin.

39:05.501 --> 39:06.626
Yes.

39:08.876 --> 39:11.001
But I need you to love me.

39:11.209 --> 39:13.001
We'll love each other later.

39:14.209 --> 39:17.084
- Now it's the revolution.
- Who is this?

39:17.293 --> 39:20.376
Chairman Mao or General Lin Bao?

39:20.584 --> 39:23.334
Don't be so bourgeois.

39:25.043 --> 39:27.751
Some things are more important.

39:27.959 --> 39:29.584
Vietnam for example.

39:32.876 --> 39:33.959
Fine.

39:34.168 --> 39:36.459
But I married Godard the director,

39:37.084 --> 39:38.918
not a political commissar.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.668
Don't play the idiot.

39:50.418 --> 39:52.043
Freedom!

39:53.251 --> 39:55.668
Paris in the streets!

39:59.376 --> 40:01.126
Oh look! Jean-Luc!

40:01.334 --> 40:02.501
- Hello.
- Hi!

40:02.709 --> 40:05.001
- Hello, how are you?
- Hello Godard.

40:06.543 --> 40:09.043
- What's your name again?
- Jean-Jock.

40:11.959 --> 40:14.751
Michel, this is Jean-Jock, a comrade.

40:14.959 --> 40:17.876
This is Michel Cournot, film critic,

40:18.084 --> 40:21.793
<i>director. He's made a film
called Les Gauloises Bleues,</i>

40:22.001 --> 40:24.168
which is selected for Cannes.

40:24.376 --> 40:25.293
Oh, that…

40:25.501 --> 40:28.334
- Cannes… The film festival?
- Yes, well…

40:28.543 --> 40:29.959
That's ridiculous!

40:30.751 --> 40:32.334
Who cares about Cannes?

40:32.543 --> 40:34.876
Only a fool would go this year!

40:35.084 --> 40:37.001
With all that's going on now!

40:38.126 --> 40:39.418
That is hilarious!

40:39.626 --> 40:41.126
He's got a point.

40:47.751 --> 40:50.543
OK, we're not going to laugh all day!

40:54.543 --> 40:55.959
Bravo for La Chinoise.

40:56.168 --> 40:58.418
My friends and I enjoyed it.

40:58.626 --> 40:59.418
Thanks.

40:59.626 --> 41:00.834
Seriously…

41:01.751 --> 41:03.293
Seriously thanks then.

41:03.501 --> 41:04.834
You're welcome.

41:06.751 --> 41:11.001
Are you going to make any more films
like Breathless?

41:13.501 --> 41:14.668
I don't know.

41:14.876 --> 41:17.126
Because that really was good.

41:17.334 --> 41:19.001
Really, it was excellent.

41:19.209 --> 41:20.959
Alright, thank you.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.668
You should use Belmondo, he's good.

41:25.876 --> 41:28.959
Funny too!
You should make more with him.

41:29.168 --> 41:31.501
I'll think about it.

41:32.918 --> 41:35.626
I won't bother you any longer Mr Godard.

41:35.834 --> 41:37.584
- Yes. Goodbye.
- Bye.

41:39.668 --> 41:41.376
He was nice.

41:41.584 --> 41:43.584
Oh yes, very nice.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.751
A good producer too.
I should have asked for his card.

42:07.584 --> 42:09.293
Are you Jean-Luc Godard?

42:11.918 --> 42:14.126
I just want to say you're amazing.

42:14.834 --> 42:16.334
Especially your films.

42:16.543 --> 42:17.959
Well… thank you.

42:19.584 --> 42:21.209
But I'm not…

42:21.418 --> 42:24.418
I'm a film student. My thesis is on you.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.209
Seeing you is amazing,

42:26.418 --> 42:29.293
to me your films embody freedom.

42:29.501 --> 42:32.251
For example, the subjects you treat

42:32.459 --> 42:35.293
such as, for instance… urbanism!

42:35.501 --> 42:38.709
Sorry, what exactly do you want from me?

42:38.918 --> 42:42.251
Nothing. I just love your films,
I've studied them.

42:42.459 --> 42:43.751
I sent you a letter…

42:43.959 --> 42:46.209
This is all very annoying.

42:47.918 --> 42:49.793
Sorry. I didn't mean to…

42:50.001 --> 42:52.543
Yes, but that kind of cinema is dead.

42:52.751 --> 42:55.959
It's irrelevant. Dead.

42:56.168 --> 42:59.918
Like you. You may think you're alive
but you're a zombie.

43:03.709 --> 43:05.043
Come on, let's go.

43:05.751 --> 43:07.626
And you ruined my shot by the way.

43:16.168 --> 43:18.876
That's better. My feet were so sore…

43:19.793 --> 43:22.459
I don't know how far we walk each day…

43:22.668 --> 43:24.209
It's not even that,

43:25.709 --> 43:27.168
it's my new shoes.

43:29.876 --> 43:32.418
I should put some wet newspaper inside

43:34.543 --> 43:35.959
to stretch them.

43:38.168 --> 43:40.584
EVERYTHING IS BRIGHTER WITH MAO

43:40.793 --> 43:42.668
This generation is bored.

43:42.876 --> 43:45.709
Who cares about Vietnam
when it's so sunny?

43:46.334 --> 43:47.834
I love young people!

43:48.043 --> 43:49.293
They're so funny!

43:49.501 --> 43:52.209
On a wall near my home someone wrote:

43:52.418 --> 43:54.626
"God also created shit".

43:54.834 --> 43:56.459
Isn't that great?

43:56.668 --> 43:58.501
God also created shit.

44:00.501 --> 44:01.459
Coming to Cannes?

44:01.668 --> 44:03.459
- I don't know.
- You must.

44:03.668 --> 44:05.543
At least for Cournot's sake…

44:05.751 --> 44:09.251
Jean-Luc won't agree.
They want to stop the festival.

44:10.751 --> 44:11.918
Do you want to go?

44:13.209 --> 44:14.251
Yes, I think so.

44:14.459 --> 44:16.543
Then go. Just tell him.

44:16.751 --> 44:18.834
And it's not fair on Cournot.

44:20.543 --> 44:23.126
You can come with us if you want…

44:23.876 --> 44:26.459
They might not even manage to stop it.

44:29.626 --> 44:33.293
Godard! Are you going to make a film
about all this?

44:33.501 --> 44:36.751
The film-maker for young people
and rebellion.

44:36.959 --> 44:38.543
No, I won't make a film.

44:38.751 --> 44:41.626
I'll start a revolution.
Like everyone else.

44:42.709 --> 44:45.876
But that means chopping off heads.

44:46.084 --> 44:47.376
Can you do that?

44:47.584 --> 44:51.209
I'm ready to start with my own.
Afterwards, I'll see.

44:51.418 --> 44:52.834
Nice motto…

44:54.209 --> 44:56.709
What do you do
to have such a nice sweater?

44:56.918 --> 44:58.543
Who's he talking to?

44:59.001 --> 45:00.918
Eric De la Meigniére.

45:01.126 --> 45:02.709
He works for Publicis.

45:03.334 --> 45:04.251
Ouch.

45:04.459 --> 45:05.793
You said it.

45:06.001 --> 45:07.209
I hate advertising.

45:07.418 --> 45:09.751
Really? But you're an expert.

45:09.959 --> 45:13.168
No. Advertising is fascism.

45:13.376 --> 45:15.751
So what is fascism then?

45:15.959 --> 45:18.084
Fascism is…

45:18.918 --> 45:21.751
it's fascism too…
You think you're funny?

45:21.959 --> 45:23.626
No, but your rhetoric is.

45:23.834 --> 45:26.584
So mock me. It won't change anything.

45:26.793 --> 45:29.293
You'll just look stupid.

45:29.501 --> 45:32.084
I'm not mocking you. Mao's the problem.

45:32.293 --> 45:36.084
Exactly, Mao means revolution.
It means your death.

45:36.293 --> 45:39.709
You must hate the Chinese
to plug Mao like this.

45:39.918 --> 45:42.793
Hang on… Plugging Mao?

45:43.001 --> 45:45.543
Who's talking here?

45:45.751 --> 45:47.626
Is it you talking?

45:47.834 --> 45:50.793
Or Publicis? Is it Pompidou?
Where are you?

45:51.001 --> 45:54.959
I'm down here. But you're
sitting on a pile of corpses…

45:56.918 --> 45:58.959
The defeat of intelligence.

46:03.751 --> 46:05.126
Those two are such jerks.

46:28.751 --> 46:32.126
You can't go to Cannes, it's impossible.

46:32.668 --> 46:37.084
Solidarity with the students is vital.
Cinema must be in touch.

46:39.418 --> 46:42.251
No, don't say hush.

46:42.876 --> 46:46.251
Why invent talking movies
if no-one speaks…

46:47.751 --> 46:49.293
Sorry, but…

46:49.918 --> 46:51.209
OK.

46:52.459 --> 46:53.668
I didn't realize.

46:55.126 --> 46:57.043
OK, I'll ask him.

46:57.251 --> 46:58.334
I'll call you back.

46:59.209 --> 47:00.543
Talk later…

47:06.834 --> 47:10.459
Rosier says the strike will cause
travel chaos.

47:11.626 --> 47:12.626
So?

47:14.168 --> 47:16.459
She thinks we should leave today.

47:16.668 --> 47:18.918
Tomorrow at the latest.

47:19.126 --> 47:20.584
So my opinion doesn't count?

47:21.084 --> 47:24.001
I may as well just piss in the wind.

47:26.126 --> 47:27.959
No, I heard.

47:29.501 --> 47:30.668
But I want to go.

47:33.751 --> 47:35.418
If only for Cournot's sake.

47:35.626 --> 47:37.584
Cournot's sake…

47:38.251 --> 47:41.168
Anyway you can't.
Nothing is organized.

47:41.668 --> 47:43.834
She says I just need a dress.

47:44.043 --> 47:45.834
We can stay with her stepfather.

47:46.043 --> 47:47.293
You mean father-in-law…

47:47.501 --> 47:49.418
- Bamban's father, or…?
- No.

47:49.626 --> 47:52.376
Her stepfather, Pierre Lazareff.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.293
<i>50 years of journalism.</i>

47:57.501 --> 48:00.334
<i>Pierre Lazareff wrote his first article
aged 15.</i>

48:00.543 --> 48:02.334
<i>By 20 he was head of news.</i>

48:02.543 --> 48:04.709
<i>In 1940, as Europe slid into war,</i>

48:05.668 --> 48:07.376
<i>Lazareff went to America.</i>

48:07.584 --> 48:11.543
<i>He came back in 1944
and created the France Soir newspaper.</i>

48:11.751 --> 48:14.501
<i>Staunch Gaullist, above all loyal.</i>

48:15.251 --> 48:17.918
<i>To his friends, colleagues, wife,</i>

48:18.543 --> 48:22.084
<i>but especially to General De Gaulle.</i>

48:24.834 --> 48:26.293
Pierre Lazareff…

48:26.709 --> 48:28.543
This takes the biscuit…

50:54.626 --> 50:55.709
Hello!

50:56.459 --> 50:58.209
Jean-Luc called. He's in Cannes.

51:02.168 --> 51:03.876
End of the holiday…

51:08.043 --> 51:09.293
<i>Now to cinema.</i>

51:09.501 --> 51:13.459
<i>Today in Cannes, a delegation
comprising Truffaut, Resnais,</i>

51:13.668 --> 51:15.334
<i>Lelouch and Godard,</i>

51:15.543 --> 51:19.209
<i>demanded the immediate cancellation
of the film festival.</i>

51:19.418 --> 51:23.543
<i>Mr Godard began the conference jovially,
even playfully,</i>

51:23.751 --> 51:25.376
<i>with irony, and I quote:</i>

51:25.584 --> 51:28.876
<i>"It was a hard-fought struggle
to conquer the hall,</i>

51:29.084 --> 51:31.543
<i>"Only ice cream can get us to leave!"</i>

51:31.751 --> 51:33.084
<i>But things heated up.</i>

51:33.293 --> 51:36.584
<i>As you will hear,
the subject turned to politics:</i>

51:37.126 --> 51:40.001
<i>The action committee for French film</i>

51:40.209 --> 51:41.793
<i>asks all the directors,</i>

51:42.001 --> 51:44.959
<i>producers, actors, journalists
present here</i>

51:45.168 --> 51:47.584
<i>to oppose the festival</i>

51:48.084 --> 51:51.209
<i>in protest against
the De Gaulle government</i>

51:51.751 --> 51:54.418
<i>and the structure of the film industry.</i>

51:55.668 --> 51:56.668
We are late!

51:56.876 --> 52:01.043
<i>It is time to show
the film industry's solidarity</i>

52:01.251 --> 52:03.918
<i>with the student and worker movements.</i>

52:04.126 --> 52:07.543
<i>The only way
is to stop all screenings now!</i>

52:08.084 --> 52:10.209
<i>I demand the festival stops!</i>

52:12.459 --> 52:15.043
<i>I'm talking about
solidarity with workers,</i>

52:15.251 --> 52:18.793
<i>you're talking tracking shots
and close-ups, assholes!</i>

52:19.001 --> 52:20.334
<i>In this toxic context,</i>

52:20.543 --> 52:24.168
<i>the festival was officially cancelled.</i>

52:24.376 --> 52:26.418
<i>Fortunately no-one was hurt,</i>

52:26.626 --> 52:29.834
<i>but Mr Godard was jostled in the clash,</i>

52:30.043 --> 52:31.459
<i>and broke his glasses.</i>

52:31.668 --> 52:33.709
<i>Luckily it was no worse.</i>

52:34.334 --> 52:36.084
<i>Over to you in Paris.</i>

52:40.418 --> 52:43.709
PIERROT THE CONTEMPT

52:50.834 --> 52:52.084
Goodbye.

52:52.293 --> 52:53.459
Yes, bye.

52:59.376 --> 53:00.584
But you're tanned!

53:00.793 --> 53:02.709
It looks good, doesn't it?

53:03.334 --> 53:04.376
No.

53:16.959 --> 53:19.251
You'll look like Ursula Andress.

53:20.751 --> 53:21.751
Great.

53:21.959 --> 53:24.709
What's the problem?
You achieved your aim.

53:25.209 --> 53:28.543
I just did what I had to.

53:28.751 --> 53:32.001
But you don't get a suntan
in a revolution.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.793
Maybe not Lenin, but Che was tanned…

53:35.001 --> 53:38.418
Very funny.
Has anyone got a car to get us to Paris?

53:38.626 --> 53:40.584
Yes, but there's no gas.

53:40.793 --> 53:43.168
That's impossible. There must be!

53:43.709 --> 53:45.251
Not enough for Paris.

53:45.459 --> 53:46.959
That's absurd.

53:48.126 --> 53:50.418
It can't be that hard to get.

53:57.959 --> 53:59.168
How long will it take?

53:59.793 --> 54:01.168
No blinking idea!

54:01.959 --> 54:03.043
Blinking idea?

54:03.251 --> 54:06.543
You wanted a general strike.
You should be happy.

54:06.751 --> 54:10.626
I am! That's why I don't want to sleep
in Lazareff's bed.

54:10.834 --> 54:13.168
You're in the guest room.

54:13.376 --> 54:15.959
By the way we're very fond of him.

54:16.584 --> 54:18.959
So watch what you say about him!

54:30.834 --> 54:33.918
I'm just impatient to get back.
I'm sorry.

54:34.126 --> 54:35.084
It's OK.

54:35.293 --> 54:37.793
But with no car, you'll have to walk.

54:38.251 --> 54:39.501
Feel free.

54:40.001 --> 54:41.626
If you can wait for a car,

54:41.834 --> 54:43.043
you're welcome

54:43.251 --> 54:45.251
to stay in Lazareff's house.

54:50.668 --> 54:51.793
Life's funny.

54:52.001 --> 54:53.793
You love Mao,
now you have a kimono.

54:54.376 --> 54:55.793
Oh shut up.

54:57.459 --> 54:59.876
Anyway, kimonos are Japanese.

55:01.043 --> 55:02.751
And between you and me,

55:02.959 --> 55:05.834
why has Lazareff got a kimono
in his closet?

55:38.626 --> 55:39.709
Are you OK?

55:40.459 --> 55:41.834
Yes, fine.

55:42.376 --> 55:43.376
I'm reading.

55:45.959 --> 55:47.959
I'm going to the bedroom.

55:49.293 --> 55:50.626
OK.

55:56.959 --> 55:59.334
<i>It's all going sour</i>

56:03.709 --> 56:05.626
<i>Strategy of violence</i>

56:11.543 --> 56:13.501
<i>Sparks will fly</i>

56:15.168 --> 56:17.376
<i>Grapes of wrath</i>

56:26.626 --> 56:28.668
<i>Desires and envy</i>

56:35.959 --> 56:37.126
<i>Misfortune</i>

56:48.376 --> 56:50.001
What are you doing?

56:54.876 --> 56:56.918
- Want to come swimming?
- No.

56:59.209 --> 57:00.793
I'm expecting a call.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.626
Makes no difference if you come down.

57:04.209 --> 57:08.001
It makes a big difference to me.

57:08.209 --> 57:10.084
But you go ahead.

57:11.001 --> 57:13.293
It's just what we need right now.

57:13.959 --> 57:17.126
You go swimming, relax.
It's vital to the country.

57:17.334 --> 57:18.334
OK, I will.

57:18.959 --> 57:22.459
With Rosier
my fellow bourgeois revisionist.

57:23.043 --> 57:24.209
Stupid little twat.

58:34.626 --> 58:35.834
Are you OK?

58:41.376 --> 58:42.959
Look, I'm sorry.

58:44.834 --> 58:46.543
I regret what I said.

58:51.376 --> 58:52.793
It's OK.

59:02.543 --> 59:04.084
What's going on?

59:04.293 --> 59:07.793
Emile can find us enough gas
to get us to Paris.

59:08.001 --> 59:09.876
Very good. Wonderful.

59:10.084 --> 59:11.293
Well done Emile.

59:12.126 --> 59:13.626
- Hello.
- Yes, sorry.

59:14.668 --> 59:17.793
We'll pick up Cournot in Cannes
on the way.

59:18.001 --> 59:19.584
We're taking Cournot?

59:25.001 --> 59:26.751
What kind of car is it?

59:33.126 --> 59:35.293
No, fine, we'll pick up Cournot.

59:42.751 --> 59:45.543
The thing is, the film is fragile.

59:45.751 --> 59:47.959
The Cannes festival

59:48.668 --> 59:51.293
would have put it in the spotlight.

59:51.501 --> 59:55.376
But the film is great.
Lots of people will go and see it.

59:55.584 --> 59:57.418
It's not really about that,

59:57.626 --> 01:00:00.626
it would have helped the film
make a mark.

01:00:02.043 --> 01:00:03.793
And premiering in Cannes,

01:00:04.959 --> 01:00:06.959
for a film, for a director

01:00:07.168 --> 01:00:10.126
is something rather special. I think.

01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:12.584
That's just the way it goes…

01:00:12.793 --> 01:00:14.084
Of course…

01:00:20.709 --> 01:00:24.959
From a collective angle,
I understand it was the only way.

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:31.501
From a personal angle, however,

01:00:32.459 --> 01:00:33.959
I'm a bit disappointed.

01:00:35.918 --> 01:00:37.501
A bit frustrated.

01:00:40.209 --> 01:00:41.501
It's understandable.

01:00:45.334 --> 01:00:47.626
If I could've shown the film at least.

01:00:47.834 --> 01:00:49.793
Is he going to piss us off all night?

01:00:50.001 --> 01:00:50.918
Oh, Jean-Luc.

01:00:51.126 --> 01:00:55.293
Otherwise I'd rather walk.
You can't whine for 800 km, Michel.

01:00:55.501 --> 01:00:57.876
I'm not whining! Try to understand me.

01:00:58.084 --> 01:01:00.584
No. Sorry. You would've looked a fool.

01:01:00.793 --> 01:01:04.043
Your film in Cannes,
with the country in turmoil.

01:01:04.251 --> 01:01:06.834
We've saved you from looking like a ass.

01:01:16.543 --> 01:01:19.751
Of course Renoir's films are bourgeois!

01:01:19.959 --> 01:01:24.209
He uses the dominant bourgeoisie's
system like everyone else.

01:01:24.418 --> 01:01:26.668
Only a fool can't understand that…

01:01:26.876 --> 01:01:30.168
A revolution means
killing existing forms of film,

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:33.084
including me, but also Lang,
Renoir, Ford.

01:01:33.584 --> 01:01:34.668
You can scoff, but…

01:01:34.876 --> 01:01:38.584
Only some of the subversive comedies
are worth saving.

01:01:38.793 --> 01:01:41.918
Jerry Lewis, Marx brothers…
The rest: in the trash.

01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:45.501
If Renoir's fit for trash,
there's no point talking.

01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:47.376
Not easy talking to Jean-Luc.

01:01:47.584 --> 01:01:49.709
Of course if you can't understand…

01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:53.668
We've got 800 km to go, so…

01:02:02.543 --> 01:02:03.751
Well I…

01:02:04.959 --> 01:02:06.584
You… I…

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:09.626
I don't go to the cinema much.

01:02:09.834 --> 01:02:11.751
I don't know anything.

01:02:11.959 --> 01:02:15.959
But I know, for example,
that I like nice stories.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:20.793
Because there is enough bad stuff
in life already,

01:02:21.001 --> 01:02:23.876
I don't want to see that in a film too.

01:02:24.918 --> 01:02:27.668
Well that's how I choose a film anyhow…

01:02:29.668 --> 01:02:30.918
When I go.

01:02:38.668 --> 01:02:40.376
Yes of course.

01:02:40.834 --> 01:02:44.209
It's true,
cinema is also for entertainment,

01:02:44.626 --> 01:02:46.959
one doesn't want to… of course.

01:02:47.418 --> 01:02:48.501
What do you think?

01:02:48.709 --> 01:02:52.126
Nothing. I'm not going to view cinema
in relation to Emile.

01:02:52.334 --> 01:02:55.376
I don't tell peasants how to run a farm.

01:02:55.584 --> 01:02:57.459
- You're such an asshole!
- Come on…

01:02:57.668 --> 01:03:01.959
He's getting you back to Paris
and this is how you treat him!

01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:05.209
You're only interested in yourself.

01:03:05.418 --> 01:03:08.459
- Oh, a lecture from the bourgeoisie.
- Fuck you!

01:03:08.668 --> 01:03:12.043
- You're not bourgeois?
- Yes but I'm aware of it!

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:15.793
You talk about peasants
but you don't see them!

01:03:19.834 --> 01:03:21.709
I'm always the scapegoat.

01:03:23.501 --> 01:03:26.334
Once you had a super-ego,
but that's gone.

01:03:26.543 --> 01:03:28.168
Now you're just an asshole!

01:03:28.376 --> 01:03:29.876
It's hard to talk to you.

01:03:30.084 --> 01:03:33.751
Doesn't anyone ever think
maybe I'm right?

01:03:38.668 --> 01:03:41.751
You're lucky we're friends,
otherwise your film,

01:03:41.959 --> 01:03:43.793
I'd say what I really thought.

01:03:44.001 --> 01:03:46.793
And you'd have experienced
the taste of shit.

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:41.209
SAVE YOUR ASS
(AND YOUR MARRIAGE)

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:48.168
I'm sorry, darling.

01:04:48.376 --> 01:04:50.334
I'm stressed at the moment.

01:04:50.918 --> 01:04:53.293
I'm totally on edge, sorry.

01:04:55.084 --> 01:04:58.084
Don't worry darling. I'm patient.

01:04:58.293 --> 01:05:01.376
Things will soon go back to normal.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:09.918
No they won't.

01:05:10.126 --> 01:05:12.668
It's a revolution. A permanent state.

01:05:14.626 --> 01:05:15.793
Sure…

01:05:25.709 --> 01:05:28.501
This may be a historic moment.

01:05:28.709 --> 01:05:32.209
Perhaps right as we speak

01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:34.959
the miracle of life is beginning.

01:05:35.584 --> 01:05:37.501
Perhaps we just made a baby.

01:05:38.084 --> 01:05:40.334
The thought did occur to me.

01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:43.918
If it's a boy we'll call him Salvador.

01:05:44.376 --> 01:05:45.501
Why?

01:05:45.709 --> 01:05:48.168
I've always wanted to be Salvador Daddy.

01:05:50.376 --> 01:05:52.709
You're so silly Mr Godard!

01:05:56.876 --> 01:05:59.501
Don't say we stayed at Lazareff's, OK?

01:06:00.293 --> 01:06:02.626
We already look like tourists…

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:04.459
Paul!

01:06:05.084 --> 01:06:06.918
- Anne, how are you?
- Good!

01:06:08.834 --> 01:06:10.043
You look lovely,

01:06:10.251 --> 01:06:12.501
you've been in the sun,
it suits you.

01:06:12.709 --> 01:06:14.876
- Thanks.
- You look rested,

01:06:15.084 --> 01:06:16.251
it's good.

01:06:17.959 --> 01:06:19.501
You're very kind.

01:06:23.918 --> 01:06:25.126
OK then…

01:06:25.334 --> 01:06:26.376
Bye!

01:06:32.584 --> 01:06:35.918
We must talk about the world,
not just France!

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.834
About Vietnam,

01:06:38.334 --> 01:06:40.626
Yemen, the Black Panthers,

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:43.043
the Kurds, Sudan…

01:06:43.251 --> 01:06:45.168
and also about Palestine.

01:06:46.668 --> 01:06:47.834
We must!

01:06:50.668 --> 01:06:51.668
We must say,

01:06:51.876 --> 01:06:54.751
without fear, that the Jews

01:06:56.084 --> 01:06:57.751
have become today's Nazis!

01:06:59.084 --> 01:07:00.501
We have to say it!

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:05.501
Hang on,
do you seriously think our committee

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:07.584
will say the Jews have become Nazis?

01:07:09.084 --> 01:07:09.793
Why not?

01:07:10.001 --> 01:07:13.293
No-one minds saying
we're all German Jews.

01:07:13.501 --> 01:07:15.626
So we should all be Palestinians too.

01:07:15.834 --> 01:07:18.751
Today's Jews are yesterday's Nazis!

01:07:19.918 --> 01:07:21.293
Or more precisely,

01:07:21.501 --> 01:07:23.793
Yesterday's Jews are today's Nazis.

01:07:24.001 --> 01:07:24.918
No. That's it!

01:07:25.126 --> 01:07:28.709
Yesterday's Jews today,
are yesterday's Nazis.

01:07:32.209 --> 01:07:37.126
Anyway we have to ask
who are the Jews today?

01:07:37.334 --> 01:07:39.459
And who are yesterday's Nazis?

01:07:39.668 --> 01:07:42.126
No! Just who are the Nazis.

01:07:42.543 --> 01:07:43.709
Today.

01:07:50.918 --> 01:07:52.084
No?

01:07:56.751 --> 01:07:58.418
Thank you Jean-Luc, very good.

01:07:58.626 --> 01:08:00.376
But it's not really today's subject.

01:08:01.626 --> 01:08:03.501
It's never today's subject!

01:08:03.709 --> 01:08:07.668
Remember Che Guevara said
we must create inner Vietnams?

01:08:07.876 --> 01:08:09.459
And so first we must

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:10.918
we must begin… What?

01:08:11.126 --> 01:08:13.001
Begin with our own Vietnam!

01:08:13.209 --> 01:08:16.917
Now we're going to listen to
Frangois Berthier,

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.001
a worker from Sud-Aviation.

01:08:23.917 --> 01:08:25.876
Is Frangois here?

01:08:26.417 --> 01:08:28.501
It's important to hear his story.

01:08:30.126 --> 01:08:33.209
We won't get anywhere,
we're too sentimental…

01:08:37.459 --> 01:08:40.501
<i>Godard: the supreme Swiss-Maoist jerk</i>

01:08:45.084 --> 01:08:45.751
<i>Godard:</i>

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:46.501
<i>the supreme</i>

01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:47.167
<i>Swiss-Maoist</i>

01:08:47.376 --> 01:08:47.792
<i>Jerk</i>

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:56.459
There's no point staying here…

01:09:07.584 --> 01:09:09.376
It's just a slogan,

01:09:09.584 --> 01:09:12.626
it's unfair, flippant, underhand.

01:09:12.834 --> 01:09:16.334
True. But the problem is, they're right.

01:09:17.667 --> 01:09:21.001
That's what Godard has become.
A teen idol.

01:09:21.834 --> 01:09:24.792
A celebrity pretending to be
a revolutionary.

01:09:25.959 --> 01:09:27.501
I can't stand the jerk.

01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:38.834
I'll change the record.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:41.792
Leave it like that.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:09:58.334
THE FIRST OF THE MOHICANS

01:09:58.543 --> 01:10:00.418
We can't aspire to freedom of speech,

01:10:00.626 --> 01:10:04.334
while begging money from producers

01:10:04.543 --> 01:10:07.168
like tenants begging from landowners.

01:10:07.376 --> 01:10:11.918
It's a disgrace! This 19th century
paternalism is shameful.

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:14.668
We must reclaim cinema.

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:16.959
Cinema should be like a hammer.

01:10:17.168 --> 01:10:20.959
A simple tool that everyone can
and should use.

01:10:21.168 --> 01:10:22.168
You're right,

01:10:22.376 --> 01:10:25.209
It's the only legitimate type of cinema,

01:10:25.418 --> 01:10:27.168
and it's exciting too.

01:10:29.918 --> 01:10:31.543
For the first time in ages

01:10:31.751 --> 01:10:35.918
I've got the right conditions
and I'm going in the right direction.

01:10:36.126 --> 01:10:37.668
Where I'm meant to be.

01:10:38.293 --> 01:10:39.959
<i>RINGO: I MADE A MISTAKE.</i>

01:10:46.918 --> 01:10:48.918
Here come the Marx Brothers.

01:10:49.126 --> 01:10:51.126
Great idea!

01:10:51.334 --> 01:10:52.751
Very jaunty!

01:10:56.168 --> 01:10:57.584
How are you, Jean-Jock?

01:10:58.334 --> 01:10:59.418
Good, and you?

01:11:00.084 --> 01:11:02.418
Couldn't be better. I've just died!

01:11:02.626 --> 01:11:03.793
What?

01:11:04.001 --> 01:11:05.959
Not me.

01:11:06.168 --> 01:11:07.751
But Godard is dead.

01:11:09.209 --> 01:11:12.751
We've set up a group
and I'll only work within it.

01:11:13.251 --> 01:11:15.501
So I feel like I'm reborn.

01:11:16.084 --> 01:11:17.543
What is this group?

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:19.084
Dziga Vertov.

01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:20.751
Dziga what?

01:11:20.959 --> 01:11:22.543
The Dziga Vertov Group.

01:11:22.751 --> 01:11:24.668
- Bless you!
- You don't know it?

01:11:24.876 --> 01:11:26.251
That's normal.

01:11:26.459 --> 01:11:27.376
Dziga Vertov.

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:29.001
Russian avant-garde?

01:11:31.168 --> 01:11:34.334
The man with the camera.
Cine-eye theories?

01:11:34.543 --> 01:11:36.459
No, I've never heard of it!

01:11:37.084 --> 01:11:39.584
Cinema with no script, no actors,

01:11:39.793 --> 01:11:41.459
no theater, no literature.

01:11:41.668 --> 01:11:43.043
No spectators either?

01:11:45.126 --> 01:11:47.668
- Stop joking around.
- It's annoying.

01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:50.751
Who's in the group?

01:11:50.959 --> 01:11:53.709
Just Jean-Luc and me for now.
You too?

01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:54.959
That's right.

01:11:59.376 --> 01:12:01.501
I don't know. What do you think?

01:12:02.626 --> 01:12:05.668
I think… what he just said…

01:12:13.293 --> 01:12:14.876
What's wrong?

01:12:15.084 --> 01:12:17.459
I just learned you're dead.

01:12:17.668 --> 01:12:20.751
Well, if you put it like that,
I understand…

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:23.084
It's a renaissance.

01:12:23.584 --> 01:12:26.334
The Renaissance.
You're completely off.

01:12:33.251 --> 01:12:35.668
- What time is it?
- Almost two.

01:12:36.334 --> 01:12:40.001
I've got to go.
Meeting with the directors' union.

01:12:40.418 --> 01:12:43.168
- I thought you didn't like them?
- I don't.

01:12:43.793 --> 01:12:46.293
That's why I've got to see them.

01:12:46.709 --> 01:12:48.293
Have fun, darling.

01:12:54.709 --> 01:12:56.626
<i>As May wore on,</i>

01:12:56.834 --> 01:13:00.084
<i>maybe due to the rising costs
of opticians,</i>

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:01.334
<i>Jean-Luc</i>

01:13:01.543 --> 01:13:04.876
<i>lost interest
in the student demonstrations.</i>

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:11.001
<i>He became a radical, dedicating himself
to the Dziga Vertov group.</i>

01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:12.126
<i>As always,</i>

01:13:12.334 --> 01:13:15.543
<i>he summed up his ideas in slogans.
The latest:</i>

01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:20.001
<i>What I like about the student movement
is the movement,</i>

01:13:20.209 --> 01:13:21.793
<i>not the students.</i>

01:13:23.043 --> 01:13:25.834
<i>That's how May ended for us,</i>

01:13:26.043 --> 01:13:29.126
<i>without us knowing
what we had revolutionized.</i>

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:31.959
What are you doing?

01:13:33.043 --> 01:13:34.709
It's an activist trick.

01:13:35.834 --> 01:13:37.626
Glue on the fingertips,

01:13:38.126 --> 01:13:40.376
to hide your fingerprints.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.459
What for?

01:13:43.501 --> 01:13:44.834
What for…

01:14:06.126 --> 01:14:10.126
As you can imagine:
a bit chaotic, but very interesting.

01:14:11.626 --> 01:14:14.668
I'm very excited
by what's happening here.

01:14:21.834 --> 01:14:24.543
Yes, why not?
That could be interesting.

01:14:25.626 --> 01:14:27.501
OK, I'll talk to her.

01:14:29.501 --> 01:14:31.834
I'll ask her then call you back.

01:14:37.501 --> 01:14:38.834
This stupid glue…

01:14:40.293 --> 01:14:41.834
That was Bertolucci.

01:14:42.043 --> 01:14:44.084
We're invited to a conference.

01:14:44.293 --> 01:14:45.293
Want to go?

01:14:45.501 --> 01:14:48.209
I don't know. Conferences and debates…

01:14:48.418 --> 01:14:49.459
Please come.

01:14:49.668 --> 01:14:52.543
Bernardo and Paola want us.
It'll do us good,

01:14:52.751 --> 01:14:54.168
a few days in Rome.

01:14:54.376 --> 01:14:55.876
I don't know…

01:14:56.084 --> 01:14:58.334
Please… You're my wife,

01:14:58.543 --> 01:15:00.168
don't make me go alone.

01:15:00.793 --> 01:15:03.876
They love us over there.
It could be great.

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.668
I have nothing…

01:15:06.876 --> 01:15:10.168
I have nothing to do with
what you just said.

01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:13.293
You have a revision…

01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:18.793
You have a revisionist idea of cinema.

01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:22.709
It makes me sick,

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:26.418
your romantic idea of cinema
and art in general.

01:15:26.626 --> 01:15:29.001
What?
How can you say that?

01:15:29.209 --> 01:15:31.709
You're insulting your own masterpieces!

01:15:32.209 --> 01:15:35.043
<i>Pierrot Le Fou! Contempt!
Breathless!</i>

01:15:35.251 --> 01:15:36.459
Shall I go on?

01:15:36.668 --> 01:15:38.334
I disown them,

01:15:38.543 --> 01:15:41.084
and all my other films! They're shit!

01:15:51.876 --> 01:15:53.709
I don't agree with Jean-Luc.

01:15:53.918 --> 01:15:55.668
They matter to us.

01:15:55.876 --> 01:16:00.001
They've shown us a new way
of making films.

01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:03.626
I've said all I had to say,

01:16:03.834 --> 01:16:05.209
I've nothing to add.

01:16:05.418 --> 01:16:07.334
On with the struggle, comrades.

01:16:16.084 --> 01:16:17.668
I'm starving,

01:16:17.876 --> 01:16:20.168
I hope they've booked dinner. Coming?

01:16:34.626 --> 01:16:36.251
Why did you do that?

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.959
No-one merits such scorn.

01:16:38.168 --> 01:16:40.418
Who decides that? You?

01:16:40.626 --> 01:16:44.334
You can thank me,
as I didn't address you directly.

01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:47.209
Because of Paola and Anne.

01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:49.959
But now here's the truth.

01:16:50.543 --> 01:16:52.918
You and I have been making shit.

01:16:53.793 --> 01:16:56.084
But you'll carry on doing it,

01:16:56.293 --> 01:16:59.251
knowing perfectly well
what you're doing.

01:17:00.043 --> 01:17:03.293
You've betrayed the ideals
of your youth.

01:17:03.501 --> 01:17:05.126
I'll tell you something,

01:17:05.959 --> 01:17:07.501
we've become enemies.

01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:08.668
Finished?

01:17:08.876 --> 01:17:10.251
Fuck you!

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:13.459
You and your pretentious sermons.

01:17:13.668 --> 01:17:16.001
You're not even aware
you're spouting bullshit.

01:17:16.209 --> 01:17:19.251
You talk about the working classes,
but you don't know them.

01:17:19.459 --> 01:17:22.418
You don't realize how they despise you.

01:17:22.626 --> 01:17:23.459
You're a little…

01:17:23.668 --> 01:17:25.543
You're an ignorant little shit.

01:17:25.751 --> 01:17:27.084
Fuck off.

01:17:28.168 --> 01:17:30.209
Well at least things are clear.

01:17:31.834 --> 01:17:33.584
Time to part company.

01:17:34.543 --> 01:17:35.709
Coming?

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:36.793
No.

01:17:39.001 --> 01:17:40.043
I'm staying…

01:17:57.084 --> 01:17:58.168
Let's go.

01:18:43.126 --> 01:18:46.668
Listen, we'll go to Prague with Gorin,

01:18:46.876 --> 01:18:49.918
it'll do us good
to make a film together.

01:18:52.126 --> 01:18:54.126
Exciting things are in store,

01:18:54.668 --> 01:18:56.876
more exciting than this bullshit.

01:18:57.501 --> 01:19:00.251
We're going to invent something new.

01:19:02.459 --> 01:19:04.209
What do you think?

01:19:07.626 --> 01:19:08.876
I don't know.

01:19:10.001 --> 01:19:11.751
I don't know what I want.

01:19:17.376 --> 01:19:20.251
Don't worry,
I know I was hard on Bernardo,

01:19:20.459 --> 01:19:22.126
but he's a revolutionary.

01:19:22.834 --> 01:19:25.834
I promise to call him
for a real discussion…

01:19:26.251 --> 01:19:28.334
and apologize. OK?

01:19:30.876 --> 01:19:34.876
Or even apologize first,
then have a real discussion.

01:19:45.001 --> 01:19:47.043
You're attracted to him, right?

01:19:49.043 --> 01:19:50.459
He's handsome…

01:19:54.876 --> 01:19:58.459
What can you do?
Such is life on board the Redoutable.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:08.834
<i>Any plans today?
Are you in a good mood today?</i>

01:20:10.584 --> 01:20:12.209
<i>No.
What's it to you?</i>

01:20:13.334 --> 01:20:16.709
<i>Is the bread fresh?
I choose the conversation. I'm your master.</i>

01:20:21.043 --> 01:20:23.084
<i>Want some'?
I don't want you to get angry.</i>

01:20:24.959 --> 01:20:28.418
No thanks. I'm fine.
That's all we need…

01:20:34.459 --> 01:20:36.918
<i>Nothing planned?
I'd like to be alone.</i>

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:39.876
<i>No.
No, I'm staying with you.</i>

01:20:40.084 --> 01:20:42.084
<i>Nothing.
I'll keep an eye on you.</i>

01:20:46.834 --> 01:20:48.543
<i>Ferreri sent a telegram.
I have bad news…</i>

01:20:48.751 --> 01:20:51.293
<i>He's sending round a script today.
I want to be free.</i>

01:20:53.043 --> 01:20:56.251
<i>Good.
Don't even try it, sweetheart.</i>

01:21:02.126 --> 01:21:05.376
<i>No idea what…
Better to talk about it later I guess.</i>

01:21:06.001 --> 01:21:08.501
<i>You'll soon see.
Yes, you're right. Let's do it this way.</i>

01:21:25.584 --> 01:21:27.668
<i>I loved him as much as I could.</i>

01:21:27.876 --> 01:21:29.793
<i>For as long as I could.</i>

01:21:30.001 --> 01:21:34.668
<i>Although this man had opened up my mind
and showed me the world,</i>

01:21:34.876 --> 01:21:37.084
<i>our horizon began to shrink.</i>

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.793
<i>Insidiously.</i>

01:21:39.001 --> 01:21:40.293
<i>Little by little.</i>

01:21:44.418 --> 01:21:45.626
Look who it is!

01:21:46.959 --> 01:21:48.543
Hello! How are you?

01:21:48.751 --> 01:21:50.584
- And you?
- We're great.

01:21:50.793 --> 01:21:53.501
- How about you?
- Fine.

01:21:58.084 --> 01:21:59.001
Good…

01:21:59.626 --> 01:22:01.543
It's sad it's ending this way.

01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:03.876
No, this is just the beginning!

01:22:04.084 --> 01:22:05.126
Yes, perhaps.

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:07.793
Not as spectacular,
but change is coming.

01:22:08.001 --> 01:22:10.543
I feel it's all gone back to how it was.

01:22:10.751 --> 01:22:13.334
It's the opposite! I think something

01:22:13.543 --> 01:22:16.668
in peoples' minds is really changing.

01:22:16.876 --> 01:22:19.668
Maybe… I don't know.

01:22:23.584 --> 01:22:24.668
We've got to go.

01:22:24.876 --> 01:22:26.126
We'll talk soon.

01:22:26.334 --> 01:22:28.501
- Bye, Jean-Luc.
- See you soon.

01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:29.876
Bye Anne.

01:22:30.084 --> 01:22:31.793
- See you.
- See you.

01:22:39.543 --> 01:22:42.043
This guy is completely crazy!

01:22:43.501 --> 01:22:45.084
Every single scene!

01:22:46.001 --> 01:22:47.709
Naked in every one!

01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:49.959
You'll turn it down?

01:22:50.168 --> 01:22:51.751
Yes, of course.

01:22:54.334 --> 01:22:57.501
Actually, could you phone him for me?

01:22:58.043 --> 01:23:00.626
- Tell him no for us both.
- Of course.

01:23:04.751 --> 01:23:07.418
And I'll even enjoy telling him.

01:23:08.126 --> 01:23:10.626
The guy may be talented,
but he's insane.

01:23:12.043 --> 01:23:13.418
Needs locking up.

01:23:15.293 --> 01:23:16.626
It's Jean-Luc.

01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:23.834
I'm calling because we've read it.

01:23:26.043 --> 01:23:28.668
I think it's a wonderful script.

01:23:29.834 --> 01:23:33.751
This shipwreck story,
it's political, metaphorical, romantic…

01:23:33.959 --> 01:23:36.001
It's superb, very strong.

01:23:36.959 --> 01:23:40.251
But my wife doesn't want
to do nude scenes.

01:23:45.668 --> 01:23:48.709
She's very young,
it would be inappropriate.

01:24:00.626 --> 01:24:02.418
Yes, that would be different,

01:24:02.626 --> 01:24:05.293
but I don't see how,
it's for every scene.

01:24:05.501 --> 01:24:07.793
That's the beauty of the script,

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:11.793
the Adam and Eve allegory,
the return to nature…

01:24:15.834 --> 01:24:18.001
Call us if you find a solution.

01:24:18.209 --> 01:24:20.543
But please don't spoil it
on our account.

01:24:22.751 --> 01:24:24.376
<i>Yes, I'll tell her.</i>

01:24:26.126 --> 01:24:27.709
Ciao Maestro, then!

01:24:29.001 --> 01:24:30.001
What did he say?

01:24:30.209 --> 01:24:31.876
That he'll get around it.

01:24:32.084 --> 01:24:34.959
I don't know how,
the movie is radically nudist.

01:24:38.834 --> 01:24:43.709
It's always surprising, this obsession
directors have with undressing actors.

01:24:44.543 --> 01:24:45.751
I don't get it.

01:24:46.793 --> 01:24:49.959
Sometimes a script justifies it,
don't you think?

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:51.501
I don't think so.

01:24:52.251 --> 01:24:54.126
Except for porn films,

01:24:54.334 --> 01:24:57.001
where the story needs it,
but apart from that…

01:24:57.584 --> 01:24:59.876
Probably my Swiss Calvinist side,

01:25:00.293 --> 01:25:02.626
but I find it ridiculous.

01:25:02.834 --> 01:25:05.959
Well if I was offered a film
with a nude scene

01:25:06.168 --> 01:25:08.334
which the script justified,

01:25:10.543 --> 01:25:12.251
I think I'd do it.

01:25:12.668 --> 01:25:14.126
Really? I wouldn't.

01:25:14.334 --> 01:25:15.668
Well I would.

01:25:27.584 --> 01:25:29.251
Hello Marco.

01:25:34.876 --> 01:25:37.251
What a good idea! That's great!

01:25:43.168 --> 01:25:45.584
I'm really pleased.

01:25:46.376 --> 01:25:47.959
I'll tell him.

01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:50.293
OK. Bye Marco.

01:25:54.043 --> 01:25:55.876
Ferreri's found a solution.

01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:58.959
A trunk of women's clothes is found.

01:25:59.168 --> 01:26:02.251
So I'll be dressed.
Only the man will be naked.

01:26:02.918 --> 01:26:04.709
He says hello by the way.

01:26:04.918 --> 01:26:06.418
The son of a bitch.

01:26:07.293 --> 01:26:08.626
Damn it.

01:26:14.376 --> 01:26:15.376
Will you accept?

01:26:15.959 --> 01:26:17.126
Why not?

01:26:18.209 --> 01:26:21.293
We're supposed to be going
to Czechoslovakia…

01:26:23.251 --> 01:26:24.751
You're going to do it?

01:26:25.376 --> 01:26:27.501
You'll abandon me?

01:26:28.876 --> 01:26:32.376
You in Italy and me in Czechoslovakia?
It's absurd. We're married.

01:26:32.584 --> 01:26:35.793
It's a lead role. I can't refuse it.

01:26:37.751 --> 01:26:40.168
I suppose I can't forbid you to do it…

01:26:41.709 --> 01:26:43.584
It means two months apart!

01:26:52.001 --> 01:26:54.709
KILL GODARD

01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:59.751
<i>Jean-Luc was in Czechoslovakia,</i>

01:26:59.959 --> 01:27:03.084
<i>making the film not yet called Pravda.</i>

01:27:04.126 --> 01:27:06.376
<i>I was in Italy…</i>

01:27:06.584 --> 01:27:09.001
<i>shooting Marco Ferreri's film,</i>

01:27:09.209 --> 01:27:12.084
already called The Seed of Man.

01:27:12.293 --> 01:27:15.501
So, do you have the scene?

01:27:16.168 --> 01:27:17.751
You go over there,

01:27:17.959 --> 01:27:19.626
you kiss him.

01:27:27.168 --> 01:27:29.043
Silence! Camera!

01:27:29.251 --> 01:27:30.043
Turning!

01:27:30.251 --> 01:27:30.959
Clap!

01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:34.126
<i>The Seed of Man,
24 - 1, first.</i>

01:27:37.459 --> 01:27:38.376
Action!

01:27:44.959 --> 01:27:47.751
<i>Jean-Luc had called
to say he was coming,</i>

01:27:48.168 --> 01:27:49.751
<i>he'd seemed agitated.</i>

01:27:49.959 --> 01:27:53.001
<i>I could immediately tell
he was in a bad mood.</i>

01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:20.293
Excuse me Miss!

01:28:20.501 --> 01:28:22.543
Your husband's in your room.

01:28:22.751 --> 01:28:24.126
Godard's here!

01:28:24.334 --> 01:28:27.293
Tell him you're very welcome
to join us for dinner.

01:28:27.501 --> 01:28:29.584
But if you'd rather be alone…

01:28:29.793 --> 01:28:31.418
We'll be very discreet.

01:28:38.959 --> 01:28:40.043
How are you?

01:28:40.751 --> 01:28:42.043
Been here long?

01:28:46.959 --> 01:28:48.251
What's wrong?

01:28:48.459 --> 01:28:49.584
Nothing.

01:28:54.001 --> 01:28:56.793
If you've just come to sulk…

01:28:57.001 --> 01:28:58.418
I didn't say anything.

01:29:05.918 --> 01:29:07.084
What is it?

01:29:18.876 --> 01:29:20.126
What is it?

01:29:21.251 --> 01:29:23.293
You're never in when I phone.

01:29:23.501 --> 01:29:24.876
It's strange.

01:29:29.084 --> 01:29:30.918
You think I'm cheating on you?

01:29:31.334 --> 01:29:32.668
I don't know.

01:29:33.959 --> 01:29:35.293
You don't know?

01:29:38.126 --> 01:29:39.626
I'm sorry…

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.209
I'm sorry.

01:30:07.084 --> 01:30:08.459
How's your film going?

01:30:09.876 --> 01:30:11.626
It's going without you.

01:30:11.834 --> 01:30:13.501
So it's slow…

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:16.001
lonely…

01:30:22.293 --> 01:30:24.209
But you all seem happy.

01:30:24.834 --> 01:30:27.626
Yes. Everyone is very jolly on set.

01:30:29.418 --> 01:30:31.751
Marco always tries to make it fun.

01:30:33.501 --> 01:30:35.418
I know that type of cinema.

01:30:36.168 --> 01:30:38.334
The set is like a holiday camp.

01:30:40.001 --> 01:30:42.751
If only his films were as fun to watch!

01:30:45.834 --> 01:30:47.459
Which one is the actor?

01:30:48.168 --> 01:30:50.084
Brown hair, opposite Marco.

01:30:51.793 --> 01:30:53.251
Why are you pointing?

01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:02.751
Wonderful. That's all we need.

01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:07.626
Evening, maestro.
I'm the actor from the film.

01:31:07.834 --> 01:31:10.709
It's an honor to shake your hand.

01:31:10.918 --> 01:31:12.918
I love your films.

01:31:13.126 --> 01:31:14.043
All of them.

01:31:14.251 --> 01:31:16.876
If you ever need an Italian actor…

01:31:17.751 --> 01:31:18.834
I'm here.

01:31:19.043 --> 01:31:20.793
Even just to open a door…

01:31:21.334 --> 01:31:22.751
Good.

01:31:36.751 --> 01:31:40.001
Sorry, I have to get back to the others.

01:31:40.209 --> 01:31:43.001
I promised to dance with the girl.

01:31:43.459 --> 01:31:44.834
It was an honor…

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:48.334
I hope I haven't bothered you.

01:31:53.751 --> 01:31:55.501
Sweaty palms, the actor.

01:31:57.251 --> 01:31:58.043
Finished?

01:31:58.251 --> 01:31:59.918
Yes, we're finished.

01:32:02.876 --> 01:32:04.459
The dessert menu?

01:32:04.668 --> 01:32:06.709
No. Do you want anything?

01:32:07.584 --> 01:32:08.918
Nothing else thanks.

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.793
- Shall we go?
- Yes please.

01:32:43.209 --> 01:32:46.084
That actor… Have you slept with him?

01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:57.168
You're not answering.

01:32:58.793 --> 01:33:00.834
What you say is disgusting.

01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:02.543
I don't see why.

01:33:02.751 --> 01:33:06.126
It's a simple question.
You just need to reply.

01:33:06.334 --> 01:33:08.168
I note that you're not.

01:33:13.126 --> 01:33:14.459
You're sick.

01:33:14.668 --> 01:33:16.418
That's right.

01:33:16.626 --> 01:33:18.209
We all are.

01:33:20.251 --> 01:33:21.918
What do you want me to say?

01:33:22.126 --> 01:33:23.876
The truth, that's all.

01:33:24.084 --> 01:33:28.584
So you won't be satisfied till I say
I've slept with everyone here?

01:33:28.793 --> 01:33:30.543
OK. Make me out to be crazy.

01:33:31.793 --> 01:33:35.209
If you want to kill your dog,
say it's got rabies.

01:33:35.418 --> 01:33:37.001
Same old story.

01:33:37.209 --> 01:33:39.293
You're acting like a jerk.

01:33:39.501 --> 01:33:40.959
You're not the man I married.

01:33:41.168 --> 01:33:43.168
Well I'm still your husband.

01:33:43.376 --> 01:33:45.001
That counts for something.

01:33:45.209 --> 01:33:48.668
You also have a duty to me.
You seem to forget this.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:53.043
What happened to you?

01:33:53.251 --> 01:33:56.293
Me? Look at you!
You look like a starlet,

01:33:56.501 --> 01:33:57.918
a little floozy.

01:33:58.668 --> 01:34:01.084
I made a choice.

01:34:01.293 --> 01:34:03.751
So no-one can tell me anything.

01:34:03.959 --> 01:34:06.793
Go on making shit
with that jerk Ferreri.

01:34:07.001 --> 01:34:08.668
That holiday camp host.

01:34:08.876 --> 01:34:11.168
Having fun on your holidays?

01:34:11.834 --> 01:34:13.418
You really want that?

01:34:13.626 --> 01:34:15.668
That mediocrity? Crappy films?

01:34:15.876 --> 01:34:18.126
Your aim in life is having fun?

01:34:18.334 --> 01:34:19.751
You're mixing everything up.

01:34:19.959 --> 01:34:23.126
I'm talking about us.
You're talking about cinema.

01:34:23.334 --> 01:34:26.376
You've gone over to the other side.

01:34:26.584 --> 01:34:27.751
Other side of what?

01:34:28.668 --> 01:34:31.501
I knew if I let you go
it would end like this.

01:34:31.959 --> 01:34:35.126
You're such a cliché, my dear.

01:34:35.751 --> 01:34:37.084
An actor!

01:34:37.293 --> 01:34:40.959
You've turned into a stupid,
common little actress.

01:34:50.793 --> 01:34:53.293
You've turned me into a jealous loser,

01:34:53.501 --> 01:34:55.626
it's so clichéd it's pathetic.

01:34:56.168 --> 01:34:57.959
Stop crying, it's annoying.

01:35:00.126 --> 01:35:02.876
You women think crying makes you right.

01:35:03.084 --> 01:35:05.043
It just makes us pity you.

01:35:05.251 --> 01:35:07.918
You're the one who is being disgusting,

01:35:08.126 --> 01:35:10.543
putting us in an impossible situation.

01:35:10.751 --> 01:35:13.293
There's surely a reason
I don't trust you!

01:35:13.501 --> 01:35:14.959
I'm not crazy!

01:35:40.168 --> 01:35:41.959
I don't love you anymore,

01:35:43.001 --> 01:35:44.543
there's no magic left,

01:35:46.543 --> 01:35:48.626
you no longer try to seduce me,

01:35:49.334 --> 01:35:50.959
or anyone else.

01:35:53.251 --> 01:35:55.418
You complain of being lonely,

01:35:55.626 --> 01:35:57.709
but you reject the whole world.

01:35:59.126 --> 01:36:02.084
Of course it's my fault people hate me.

01:36:02.293 --> 01:36:04.918
The truth is you don't love me anymore,

01:36:05.126 --> 01:36:06.918
that's your choice.

01:36:07.126 --> 01:36:09.293
I'm not at all sure it's my fault.

01:36:09.834 --> 01:36:11.959
I won't let you talk to me like that.

01:36:24.001 --> 01:36:25.418
There you go!

01:36:26.209 --> 01:36:28.793
You've found an excuse to abandon me!

01:36:31.251 --> 01:36:32.959
You're like all the others.

01:36:33.501 --> 01:36:35.876
You match your thoughts to your acts,

01:36:36.334 --> 01:36:37.709
instead of the opposite.

01:36:37.918 --> 01:36:40.668
I have to get up early, I need to sleep.

01:36:41.668 --> 01:36:43.668
You're impossible to argue with.

01:36:43.876 --> 01:36:45.918
You're so cruel and mean.

01:36:46.126 --> 01:36:47.501
You're cold.

01:37:49.376 --> 01:37:51.543
<i>A domestic dispute is like a phrase:</i>

01:37:51.751 --> 01:37:55.001
<i>there's no obligation for it to stop.</i>

01:37:55.501 --> 01:37:58.584
<i>Each partner dreams
of having the last word.</i>

01:37:58.793 --> 01:38:03.043
<i>"Concluding" assigns a destiny
to all that has been said.</i>

01:38:03.251 --> 01:38:05.876
<i>The dispute proceeds with this in view,</i>

01:38:06.418 --> 01:38:09.959
<i>There is no question
that each remark should contribute</i>

01:38:10.168 --> 01:38:12.209
<i>to the victory of a truth,</i>

01:38:12.418 --> 01:38:15.418
<i>only that the last remark
be the right one.</i>

01:38:15.626 --> 01:38:17.626
<i>The last roll of the dice counts.</i>

01:38:17.834 --> 01:38:20.209
Jean-Luc, I'm going.

01:38:21.959 --> 01:38:26.668
<i>For a last word to be truly peremptory,</i>

01:38:27.376 --> 01:38:29.793
<i>only suicide will suffice.</i>

01:39:17.334 --> 01:39:19.584
<i>Jean-Luc didn't totally die that day.</i>

01:39:19.793 --> 01:39:23.501
<i>But the Jean-Luc I had loved
vanished for ever.</i>

01:39:24.043 --> 01:39:28.793
<i>His suicide attempt was too violent
an act against me. I never forgave him.</i>

01:39:34.709 --> 01:39:38.959
<i>We split up almost a year later,
while filming Vent d'Est,</i>

01:39:39.376 --> 01:39:43.584
<i>an attempt at a Maoist western
by the Dziga Vertov Group.</i>

01:39:46.376 --> 01:39:48.751
<i>The Jean-Luc who had survived won.</i>

01:39:48.959 --> 01:39:52.459
<i>It was auto-managed cinema,
there was no boss,</i>

01:39:52.668 --> 01:39:55.084
<i>all decisions were made collectively.</i>

01:39:58.293 --> 01:40:01.293
<i>Every morning, in the name of democracy,</i>

01:40:01.501 --> 01:40:03.959
<i>the crew held a general meeting</i>

01:40:04.168 --> 01:40:06.959
<i>to decide on the afternoon's shooting.</i>

01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:12.543
<i>So every morning, Jean-Luc
was confronted with the same dilemma:</i>

01:40:12.751 --> 01:40:16.501
<i>respect the revolution
in defiance of cinema,</i>

01:40:16.709 --> 01:40:19.709
<i>or making a film
in defiance of the revolution.</i>

01:40:19.918 --> 01:40:22.793
Try to understand him.
You're making no effort.

01:40:23.001 --> 01:40:24.751
If you're the only one defending it…

01:40:24.959 --> 01:40:26.543
No, there is a language!

01:40:26.751 --> 01:40:29.793
If you decide to use it,
you must learn it.

01:40:30.543 --> 01:40:31.959
You're pissing us off.

01:40:33.918 --> 01:40:36.834
We earn peanuts,
we can't afford dead Indians.

01:40:37.043 --> 01:40:40.584
We have to! The film must mention
the Indian genocide.

01:40:40.793 --> 01:40:41.876
We can't cut corners.

01:40:42.084 --> 01:40:43.834
So pay them with your money.

01:40:44.043 --> 01:40:46.918
If you make the decisions, you pay.

01:40:47.126 --> 01:40:48.668
These tracking shots!

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:52.334
Talk about the Indian genocide
if you want,

01:40:52.543 --> 01:40:56.334
but without all the extras,
and endless tracking shots!

01:40:56.543 --> 01:41:00.126
Revolutionary cinema is still cinema.

01:41:00.334 --> 01:41:03.168
There's no rule against tracking shots.

01:41:03.793 --> 01:41:05.751
Especially if it has a meaning,

01:41:05.959 --> 01:41:07.834
and means the revolution.

01:41:08.043 --> 01:41:10.209
You don't want to change anything…

01:41:10.418 --> 01:41:14.209
You're pissing everyone off
with your tracking shot!

01:41:14.418 --> 01:41:16.043
Aren't you acting like a boss?

01:41:16.251 --> 01:41:19.334
No, I feel like I'm the lone man…

01:41:19.876 --> 01:41:23.584
Yes I'm alone,
because I can see things you can't.

01:41:23.793 --> 01:41:26.084
I understand things you can't.

01:41:28.334 --> 01:41:29.293
At least I have doubts.

01:41:29.501 --> 01:41:31.876
We have to make a decision now.

01:41:32.084 --> 01:41:33.584
You've got to choose.

01:41:33.793 --> 01:41:36.709
Either accept what the majority wants

01:41:36.918 --> 01:41:41.043
or go on acting like the boss,
which means forget the revolution.

01:41:41.251 --> 01:41:45.126
You have to choose:
either it's politics, or cinema.

01:41:55.918 --> 01:41:58.793
OK. I'll go with the majority.

01:42:12.293 --> 01:42:14.959
<i>I'm not sure when I lost the plot.</i>

01:42:15.668 --> 01:42:19.626
<i>Something broke
and was never the same again.</i>

01:42:21.334 --> 01:42:24.251
<i>Maybe that's what
the revolution is about.</i>

01:42:25.084 --> 01:42:27.959
<i>I killed Godard, I killed Jean-Luc.</i>

01:42:28.626 --> 01:42:30.668
<i>But that's how I became myself.</i>

01:42:31.751 --> 01:42:36.001
<i>And it's not because I was mistaken
that I was wrong.</i>

01:42:36.418 --> 01:42:38.418
<i>I did disappoint many people.</i>

01:42:38.626 --> 01:42:40.834
<i>Some felt betrayed,</i>

01:42:41.043 --> 01:42:42.793
<i>but you know what?</i>

01:42:43.001 --> 01:42:45.084
<i>It doesn't matter in the end,</i>

01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:49.418
<i>for such is life
on board the Redoutable…</i>
