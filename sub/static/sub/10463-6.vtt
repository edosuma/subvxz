WEBVTT

00:07.134 --> 00:09.863
Bailey... Bailey, come on.

00:09.887 --> 00:11.605
Coit Tower.

00:15.309 --> 00:17.913
Without question the
most pointless landmark

00:17.937 --> 00:19.539
in the San Francisco skyline,

00:19.563 --> 00:21.667
Coit Tower was
completed in 1944...

00:21.691 --> 00:23.126
1934.

00:23.150 --> 00:25.921
At the bequest of Coit S.
Interruptus.

00:25.945 --> 00:28.548
Bailey, you're not
taking this seriously.

00:28.572 --> 00:30.374
No, I'm not,

00:30.491 --> 00:33.377
but I do take you
very seriously.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.683
I thought you wanted this job.

00:37.707 --> 00:39.883
Who knew you had to
take a stupid test?

00:39.917 --> 00:41.311
What did you think?

00:41.335 --> 00:42.813
They'd just stick
you in a tour bus

00:42.837 --> 00:44.981
and hand you a microphone
and let you say stuff like,

00:45.005 --> 00:46.608
"On your right, the
Golden Gate Bridge.

00:46.632 --> 00:49.226
It's tall, it's
long, it's orange"?

00:51.095 --> 00:52.698
Forget me driving you to school.

00:52.722 --> 00:57.067
What do you say we take a
drive through the Presidio,

00:57.643 --> 01:01.415
"One of the oldest military
installations in the United States"?

01:01.439 --> 01:03.073
Oh, God.

01:03.315 --> 01:04.376
Or not.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.201
No, I mean, it's my dad.

01:10.781 --> 01:12.259
Barley, isn't it?

01:12.283 --> 01:14.845
Uh, Bailey, sir.

01:14.869 --> 01:16.295
Bailey Salinger.

01:16.495 --> 01:17.848
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

01:17.872 --> 01:19.465
Yes, well...

01:19.623 --> 01:22.144
Bailey was gonna give
me a lift to school.

01:22.168 --> 01:25.220
Yeah. I'm an excellent driver.

01:26.714 --> 01:30.392
Katie, why don't you invite your
friend for dinner tomorrow?

01:30.634 --> 01:33.479
The street is no place to
get to know each other.

01:34.472 --> 01:37.775
Well, I'm late for City Hall.

01:40.728 --> 01:42.696
City Hall.

01:42.897 --> 01:44.499
Completed in 1915,

01:44.523 --> 01:48.410
its dome is taller than
our nation's Capitol.

01:51.447 --> 01:53.332
Not to worry.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:06.253 --> 02:08.231
I didn't know you worked here.

02:08.255 --> 02:10.025
Yeah, well, I do.

02:10.049 --> 02:11.433
Cool.

02:12.384 --> 02:14.103
They know how old you are?

02:16.639 --> 02:18.075
Hey, can I get a
Beck's over here, Sam?

02:18.099 --> 02:20.484
Yeah, you got it. There you go.

02:20.559 --> 02:22.903
They let you cop drinks
for your friends?

02:25.397 --> 02:29.576
Well, that's too bad because
I'm totally out of cash.

02:32.655 --> 02:34.331
You look good.

02:34.448 --> 02:36.301
What, now that I can buy
you a drink, you like me?

02:36.325 --> 02:37.835
Is that it?

02:38.244 --> 02:39.596
What's your problem?
I just said...

02:39.620 --> 02:42.265
I didn't deserve you dumping
me the way you did.

02:42.289 --> 02:43.767
Oh, right. That.

02:43.791 --> 02:44.726
Yeah, that.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.061
I mean, I liked
you, and you just...

02:46.085 --> 02:47.594
Oh, you liked me, huh?

02:47.711 --> 02:50.482
Did you like me, or did
you really like me?

02:50.506 --> 02:51.775
Because if you really liked me...

02:51.799 --> 02:53.976
Oh, God, there's something
wrong with you.

02:57.429 --> 02:59.648
Why do you have to
be such a jerk?

03:09.525 --> 03:12.587
<i>♪ Everybody wants to live ♪</i>

03:12.611 --> 03:14.172
<i>♪ Like they want to live ♪</i>

03:14.196 --> 03:17.759

03:17.783 --> 03:19.427

03:45.144 --> 03:46.955
A jacket adds elegance.

03:46.979 --> 03:48.655
Jacket. Right.

03:49.815 --> 03:53.702
Charlie, can you tell me what a
lowest common denominator is?

03:53.944 --> 03:56.381
You mean like when something
appeals to everyone,

03:56.405 --> 03:58.884
like in sex or violence?

03:58.908 --> 04:01.543
Like in fractions. I'm
doing my math homework.

04:01.827 --> 04:03.680
Oh. Then I don't remember.

04:03.704 --> 04:04.723
Claud, what do you think?

04:04.747 --> 04:05.724
Needs a tie.

04:05.748 --> 04:07.049
Needs a tie.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.103
Could you just take a look
at what it says here?

04:10.127 --> 04:12.012
Maybe you can figure it out.

04:12.213 --> 04:14.065
Claud, I've got to split.
I'm late.

04:14.089 --> 04:15.192
It'll just take a second.

04:15.216 --> 04:16.817
It never takes a second, Claud,

04:16.841 --> 04:18.111
and I really don't
know this stuff.

04:18.135 --> 04:20.113
Dad used to help me
with my homework.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.563
Claud...

04:21.764 --> 04:22.741
Ditch the jacket.

04:22.765 --> 04:23.950
The jacket's out.

04:23.974 --> 04:26.328
He taught me the
multiplication tables

04:26.352 --> 04:27.913
with all those
colored flash cards.

04:27.937 --> 04:30.207
Look, I'm really busy and
I've got to get to work,

04:30.231 --> 04:31.750
so I can't do this with you.

04:31.774 --> 04:33.376
Ask someone else. Ask Julia.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.420
Dad used to sit with me
for as long as it took

04:35.444 --> 04:37.120
till I got them all right,

04:37.571 --> 04:39.665
especially the sevens.

04:41.116 --> 04:42.969
He let me sit in the
kitchen at the restaurant

04:42.993 --> 04:44.586
while he cooked.

04:45.871 --> 04:46.932
Remember that?

04:46.956 --> 04:47.933
Look, you know what, Claudia?

04:47.957 --> 04:49.925
I don't need a guilt
trip from you, okay?

04:50.376 --> 04:51.760
Okay?

04:51.919 --> 04:53.262
Sorry.

04:57.925 --> 04:59.351
Lose the tie.

04:59.718 --> 05:01.478
The tie.

05:04.807 --> 05:06.066
They'll love you.

05:06.183 --> 05:07.526
Thanks.

05:07.768 --> 05:09.319
See you later.

05:10.813 --> 05:11.957
Kind of quiet, huh?

05:11.981 --> 05:12.999
Yeah.

05:13.023 --> 05:15.126
Hey, listen, last night,
a bunch of your checks,

05:15.150 --> 05:17.003
they were off a couple
of bucks here and there,

05:17.027 --> 05:18.380
but, you know, adds up.

05:18.404 --> 05:20.173
I'm sorry. I'll watch it.

05:20.197 --> 05:23.542
You know, Charlie, sometimes I
get the feeling you're bored.

05:24.159 --> 05:27.296
Your mind is elsewhere. There are
times you'd rather not be here.

05:28.914 --> 05:31.925
What are you doing, Joe? I said
I was sorry about the checks.

05:33.043 --> 05:34.187
You firing me?

05:34.211 --> 05:35.762
I'm promoting you.

05:36.463 --> 05:37.440
You're kidding.

05:37.464 --> 05:39.818
No. I think it'd be
a really good idea.

05:39.842 --> 05:41.027
I mean, I've seen you.

05:41.051 --> 05:42.362
You can do a pretty
damn good job

05:42.386 --> 05:43.863
when it's something
you care about.

05:43.887 --> 05:44.864
Thanks, but...

05:44.888 --> 05:47.649
It'd be a lot more work, but it's
something you can take some pride in.

05:48.142 --> 05:50.036
Joe, thanks, but I
don't think so.

05:50.060 --> 05:51.945
I mean, I'm happy tending bar.
Really.

05:51.979 --> 05:54.448
I think you should expect
more of yourself, too.

05:54.606 --> 05:56.710
You know, your dad taught me
how to manage this place.

05:56.734 --> 05:57.961
It's an art, Charlie.

05:57.985 --> 06:01.705
Handling people, ordering
supplies, managing crises...

06:01.780 --> 06:03.383
He was really good at it too.

06:03.407 --> 06:04.551
- Was he?
- Yeah.

06:04.575 --> 06:06.594
I think if you put
your mind to it,

06:06.618 --> 06:08.628
you might find that
you're just as good.

06:13.167 --> 06:14.843
One night a week.

06:16.336 --> 06:17.397
Tennis.

06:17.421 --> 06:18.815
We've been really into tennis.

06:18.839 --> 06:20.807
It's sort of an
obsession with us.

06:21.341 --> 06:22.736
What's your sport, Bailey?

06:22.760 --> 06:23.737
Football.

06:23.761 --> 06:26.855
Mm. No kidding. You
play football,

06:26.889 --> 06:29.868
for, uh, what is it,
uh, Grant High?

06:29.892 --> 06:32.287
Uh, no. Not...

06:32.311 --> 06:34.247
Not really. Not anymore.

06:34.271 --> 06:36.573
There was this incident, Dad.

06:37.149 --> 06:39.368
It's kind of hard to explain.

06:39.610 --> 06:42.704
You see, there was this
fight, and I saw it,

06:42.821 --> 06:45.425
and there was sort of a
philosophical difference

06:45.449 --> 06:46.968
between the school
principal and I

06:46.992 --> 06:50.055
over whether or not
I should tell,

06:50.079 --> 06:52.214
and the whole thing
was sort of a mess.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.184
I really don't know how to
describe what happened.

06:54.208 --> 06:56.051
You were suspended.

06:57.419 --> 06:59.471
You could put it that way, yeah.

07:02.508 --> 07:05.685
I suppose my feeling is, sir,

07:06.261 --> 07:09.398
that I want to keep my
options open at this point.

07:09.556 --> 07:11.525
That is so smart.

07:12.059 --> 07:14.204
Yeah. I mean, I'm young.

07:14.228 --> 07:16.029
Now's the time to experiment.

07:16.146 --> 07:19.000
I don't think I need to make any
definite decisions about my future.

07:19.024 --> 07:20.575
I couldn't disagree more.

07:22.486 --> 07:23.912
No kidding.

07:23.946 --> 07:26.039
The world is no place
for dilettantes.

07:26.448 --> 07:29.084
The sooner you decide what
you want to specialize in,

07:29.284 --> 07:31.378
the sooner you get the
skills necessary,

07:32.204 --> 07:34.214
the better your chances
are for success.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.094
That would be the other
way to look at it.

07:40.963 --> 07:42.899
Well, I'm hoping to become
a licensed tour guide

07:42.923 --> 07:45.308
for the Spirit of San
Francisco tour bus company.

07:45.759 --> 07:49.438
"Give us an hour, and we'll give
you that San Fran-tastic feeling!"

07:50.514 --> 07:52.566
Really? Tourism.

07:52.683 --> 07:54.234
Yeah, and, uh...

07:54.309 --> 07:56.653
and I did work in this little
shoe store for a while.

07:59.106 --> 08:02.951
I know that doesn't immediately
suggest an exciting future, but...

08:07.781 --> 08:12.210
That's some job, being the only adult
in a house with three kids and a baby.

08:12.828 --> 08:14.463
Exactly how much older is he?

08:15.330 --> 08:19.968
- He's 24.
- And a great guy, Dad.

08:20.127 --> 08:24.848
He is. You'd swear he was like
40 the way he's so mature,

08:24.923 --> 08:30.353
and, you know, he's responsible and,
you know, levelheaded and competent.

08:30.637 --> 08:32.688
Nothing fazes him.

08:33.182 --> 08:36.067
God, he's there for us
like 24 hours a day.

08:36.101 --> 08:38.028
No one has bad things
to say about Charlie.

08:38.061 --> 08:39.696
Mm-hmm.

08:40.397 --> 08:42.532
I think I'd like to meet him.

08:44.275 --> 08:45.911
Great.

08:57.623 --> 08:58.924
What happened to you?

09:01.376 --> 09:03.011
I, uh...

09:03.629 --> 09:05.055
I can't...

09:06.048 --> 09:07.641
P.K.?

09:10.844 --> 09:12.729
Can I come in?

09:13.096 --> 09:14.731
Please?

09:17.309 --> 09:19.110
I've got nowhere else to go.

09:41.542 --> 09:43.019
How's that feel?

09:43.043 --> 09:44.427
Cold.

09:47.256 --> 09:48.890
That the only place that...

09:49.466 --> 09:50.985
He hit me?

09:51.009 --> 09:52.435
Yeah.

09:53.929 --> 09:56.690
Your stepfather, he,
um, do this a lot?

09:57.474 --> 09:58.942
It happens.

09:59.351 --> 10:00.662
Have you ever tried...

10:00.686 --> 10:02.654
Look, I don't want to
talk about it, okay?

10:02.938 --> 10:04.948
I just don't want
to talk about it.

10:09.611 --> 10:11.538
Would it be cool if I, uh...

10:12.072 --> 10:13.498
Crashed on your sofa?

10:17.160 --> 10:18.837
Uh...

10:19.371 --> 10:21.298
I'll get some blankets.

10:24.585 --> 10:26.354
You'll have to be quiet, though.

10:26.378 --> 10:28.930
My sister sleeps in the
dining room in a tent.

10:29.923 --> 10:31.683
Your sister sleeps in a tent?

10:32.009 --> 10:33.977
Kind of a weird family.

10:37.848 --> 10:40.191
Well, you have no idea.

10:42.477 --> 10:43.705
Humor me.

10:43.729 --> 10:46.416
If he asks you about your
job, what are you gonna say?

10:46.440 --> 10:47.584
Just walk me through it.

10:47.608 --> 10:49.043
I'll tell him I'm
managing a restaurant.

10:49.067 --> 10:50.285
The truth.

10:50.527 --> 10:51.879
Perfect. That's good.

10:51.903 --> 10:53.423
We'll play up the
small business angle,

10:53.447 --> 10:55.425
and don't mention bartending.

10:55.449 --> 10:56.467
This is ridiculous.

10:56.491 --> 10:59.012
The man is stopping by the
restaurant to meet your family.

10:59.036 --> 11:00.096
It's a friendly gesture.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.932
I don't think so. I made a very
bad impression last night,

11:02.956 --> 11:05.518
and I kind of think he's nervous
about the atmosphere around here.

11:05.542 --> 11:06.519
Why would he be nervous?

11:06.543 --> 11:10.481
Listen, you guys, P.K.'s afraid that people are gonna
start asking questions about where he's hiding out,

11:10.505 --> 11:13.016
so he's gonna cut school
today and stay here.

11:13.842 --> 11:15.028
Point taken.

11:15.052 --> 11:17.613
Look, not having parents
around doesn't help,

11:17.637 --> 11:19.157
so the illusion of an
authority figure...

11:19.181 --> 11:21.024
- Hey, you know what?
- I'm sorry.

11:21.141 --> 11:27.364
It just... Look, if he asks how you're planning
for the future, just say something like,

11:27.731 --> 11:30.075
"The world is no place
for debutantes."

11:31.526 --> 11:33.286
Trust me on this one.

11:35.781 --> 11:37.916
And you think he'll
look at outside bids?

11:38.283 --> 11:39.260
Uh-huh.

11:39.284 --> 11:41.211
Um, what's the address?

11:44.790 --> 11:46.883
Okay. How about 20 minutes?

11:47.417 --> 11:49.302
Hey, thanks for the tip, man.

11:49.586 --> 11:51.429
What, are you going somewhere?

11:51.463 --> 11:54.192
I just got a lead on a big restoration
job over on Russian Hill.

11:54.216 --> 11:56.277
I'm going to check it out, see if
it's something I want to bid on.

11:56.301 --> 11:57.278
I'll be back in an hour.

11:57.302 --> 11:58.321
Wait. Hold the phone.

11:58.345 --> 12:00.146
Did you do the table
assignments, yet?

12:00.263 --> 12:01.824
Chart's in the kitchen.

12:01.848 --> 12:03.701
Did you confirm
tonight's reservations?

12:03.725 --> 12:05.620
We got a full house till 9:45.

12:05.644 --> 12:07.779
Are you familiar
with the specials?

12:08.397 --> 12:10.458
Salmon, veal chops,
Mediterranean chicken.

12:10.482 --> 12:12.200
What is this, a test?

12:12.484 --> 12:14.295
I'll be back in two hours, tops.

12:14.319 --> 12:16.246
Charlie, you said an hour.

12:26.665 --> 12:29.342
It's not polite to smoke
in the house, you know.

12:30.502 --> 12:33.430
Other people breathe
that stuff in.

12:35.924 --> 12:37.308
Happy?

12:38.218 --> 12:40.353
Have you ever done drugs?

12:42.681 --> 12:44.566
Hard drugs?

12:46.852 --> 12:48.570
Anything intravenous?

12:50.188 --> 12:51.416
Yeah,

12:51.440 --> 12:53.783
and I killed a guy
once for a cigarette.

12:57.112 --> 12:58.705
You just love me, don't you?

12:59.322 --> 13:01.583
You were kind of
creepy to my sister.

13:03.034 --> 13:05.587
Yeah, I was stupid, huh?

13:09.499 --> 13:11.843
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

13:13.128 --> 13:14.888
Yeah.

13:16.423 --> 13:17.932
Me too.

13:21.928 --> 13:23.281
I don't mind if you stay here.

13:23.305 --> 13:24.689
Claudia.

13:24.890 --> 13:27.994
Hey, P.K. Claud, you ready?

13:28.018 --> 13:29.787
Bailey's going to meet us there.

13:29.811 --> 13:31.622
We're going for dinner
at our dad's restaurant.

13:31.646 --> 13:33.573
It's kind of a thing.
Want to come with?

13:33.940 --> 13:35.700
I don't think so.

13:35.817 --> 13:37.702
Okay. I'll bring something back.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.913
See you.

13:41.781 --> 13:44.584
There'd better not be anything
missing when we get back.

13:44.951 --> 13:46.252
Yes, ma'am. Right away.

13:48.830 --> 13:49.974
Sorry. Sorry.

13:49.998 --> 13:51.142
Charlie, you got a minute?

13:51.166 --> 13:52.550
Not now, Bay.

13:53.835 --> 13:56.022
It's the pressures of
running a small business.

13:56.046 --> 13:57.398
Can you imagine?

13:57.422 --> 14:00.234
You know, we ordered our
appetizers 30 minutes ago.

14:00.258 --> 14:01.935
I'll check on it.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.686
Some problem in the kitchen.

14:03.887 --> 14:06.272
Yes, well, we probably
shouldn't stay for dinner.

14:06.389 --> 14:07.700
Maybe tonight is a mistake.

14:07.724 --> 14:09.692
No. No, it isn't. Charlie?

14:09.726 --> 14:12.320
Mr. Bishop. Charlie Salinger.

14:12.771 --> 14:15.406
Sorry about the, uh, chaos.

14:15.982 --> 14:17.043
That's okay.

14:17.067 --> 14:18.961
I was just anxious to meet
the person in charge...

14:18.985 --> 14:21.088
Actually, could you
give me a minute?

14:21.112 --> 14:22.215
Charlie, I'm starving.

14:22.239 --> 14:23.841
I thought you said 10 minutes.

14:23.865 --> 14:25.134
Claudia.

14:25.158 --> 14:26.636
He is so resourceful.

14:26.660 --> 14:28.054
Cancel the appetizers!

14:28.078 --> 14:29.639
Just bring us the entrees.

14:29.663 --> 14:30.890
Fine.

14:30.914 --> 14:32.308
Sorry about Charlie.

14:32.332 --> 14:34.101
He doesn't usually
manage the restaurant.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.353
He's just a bartender.

14:35.377 --> 14:36.646
Claudia!

14:36.670 --> 14:38.981
Talk about moving up
quickly in a job.

14:39.005 --> 14:40.849
Your brother tends
bar every night?

14:40.882 --> 14:43.226
He calls home frequently.

14:43.677 --> 14:45.530
I really want get a
chance to talk with you.

14:45.554 --> 14:46.697
Same here.

14:46.721 --> 14:48.908
Bailey has told me so much about
you that I feel as though...

14:48.932 --> 14:50.358
Hey!

14:50.559 --> 14:52.652
Actually, could you give
me one more minute?

14:53.061 --> 14:56.040
Sir, your entrees are not ready, but
as soon as they are, I promise...

14:56.064 --> 14:57.917
You know what? This is insane.

14:57.941 --> 14:59.585
I get better service
eating at home.

14:59.609 --> 15:00.878
Then why don't you just leave?

15:00.902 --> 15:05.123
My apologies. Your dinner will be
here in a few minutes, on the house.

15:05.490 --> 15:06.843
What was that about?

15:06.867 --> 15:08.094
The guy was in my face.

15:08.118 --> 15:10.847
Will you pull your act together? We've
got a big problem here, thanks to you.

15:10.871 --> 15:12.849
It's not my fault the damn
range blew in the kitchen.

15:12.873 --> 15:14.642
Well, maybe if you had stuck
around this afternoon...

15:14.666 --> 15:15.643
Can we talk about this later?

15:15.667 --> 15:19.230
Instead of running off the first chance you got,
you would have taken care of it three hours ago.

15:19.254 --> 15:21.107
You were out too, Joe. You
could have seen to it.

15:21.131 --> 15:22.608
This was your night to manage.

15:22.632 --> 15:25.945
You know, this irresponsible kid act
of yours is starting to wear thin.

15:25.969 --> 15:27.405
Thanks for the advice, Joe.

15:27.429 --> 15:28.865
Do you think your father...

15:28.889 --> 15:31.649
Hey, you know what? I don't want to
hear it. I've got to get back to work.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.568
That's Charlie.

15:33.602 --> 15:35.069
Claudia.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.533
I think you still like him.

15:40.817 --> 15:42.869
Throw me a towel, would you?

15:43.069 --> 15:45.590
I think you still want
to go out with him.

15:45.614 --> 15:47.174
- I do not.
- Do too.

15:47.198 --> 15:49.176
- Claudia...
- Do too. Do too.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.177
Shh.

15:50.201 --> 15:52.128
You're so obnoxious.
You know that?

15:54.497 --> 15:56.758
So I guess he apologized, huh?

15:58.126 --> 15:59.969
For what he did to you.

16:00.879 --> 16:03.139
- Before.
- No.

16:04.716 --> 16:06.569
Then how come you're
not still mad at him?

16:06.593 --> 16:08.362
I'm just not, okay?

16:08.386 --> 16:09.896
Why?

16:10.597 --> 16:14.317
Maybe all that stuff going on with
him at home just made him act...

16:15.310 --> 16:16.653
I don't know.

16:19.981 --> 16:22.742
I guess he kind of doesn't
have any parents either.

16:28.823 --> 16:31.417
What does that mean, a curfew?

16:32.953 --> 16:35.713
You can't stay later
than six p.m.? No.

16:36.164 --> 16:38.633
God, Katie, you got to
talk him out of that.

16:40.251 --> 16:44.597
Okay, okay, so Charlie isn't
exactly a model parent.

16:46.424 --> 16:48.361
Okay, so there's no
adult in the house.

16:48.385 --> 16:50.979
What does your dad think happens
here when you come over?

16:51.638 --> 16:55.942
Don't answer that. Okay.

16:57.185 --> 16:59.112
Okay, okay, here's what we do.

16:59.562 --> 17:03.491
What? Now? Well, just...

17:04.067 --> 17:07.578
Just tell him you're on the phone...
with your priest.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.457
Okay, okay. Okay.

17:12.157 --> 17:15.752
I'm sorry. Good night.

17:41.187 --> 17:42.655
Can't sleep?

17:44.566 --> 17:45.950
You play?

17:46.276 --> 17:48.953
A little. Not anymore.

17:49.237 --> 17:50.872
You take lessons and stuff?

17:51.322 --> 17:53.958
- My mom kind of taught me.
- Yeah?

17:55.493 --> 17:57.795
It's two in the morning.
Aren't you tired?

18:00.623 --> 18:06.554
My dad... my step dad, Frank,
he taught me how to smoke.

18:08.465 --> 18:10.224
Camel Straights.

18:13.386 --> 18:16.689
And darts. We played darts once.

18:21.936 --> 18:25.323
- Maybe you should lie down.
- No.

18:26.357 --> 18:28.659
- Maybe if you tried?
- No.

18:30.904 --> 18:32.288
Why not?

18:37.035 --> 18:39.295
I don't want to close my eyes.

18:43.541 --> 18:46.094
I have this dream all the time

18:47.879 --> 18:51.108
when I'm just going along,
you know, just going along,

18:51.132 --> 18:53.059
and out of nowhere, he hits me.

18:56.471 --> 18:58.481
You should tell
someone about it.

18:59.474 --> 19:01.818
- Your mom.
- She knows.

19:02.102 --> 19:03.079
But...

19:03.103 --> 19:07.407
She knows, okay? She knows.

19:18.368 --> 19:20.545
I bought Frank...

19:21.830 --> 19:26.050
this really good bottle of
whiskey for his birthday.

19:27.627 --> 19:29.429
He punched me out,

19:32.590 --> 19:36.978
because he figured
that I stole it.

19:41.516 --> 19:44.569
But he drank it, you know?

19:46.646 --> 19:48.322
He hates me.

19:48.898 --> 19:51.576
- No.
- Yes, he does.

19:52.110 --> 19:53.995
He hates me.

19:55.196 --> 19:57.123
He's got a problem,
and he needs help.

19:59.450 --> 20:02.670
We've all got problems,
and we all need help.

20:05.582 --> 20:11.637
The one thing that I, I
can't figure out, is...

20:13.548 --> 20:17.560
What did I do? What did I do?

20:17.677 --> 20:21.981
What thing did I do that was so
bad that he can't forgive me?

20:27.687 --> 20:30.531
Shh. It's okay.

20:34.694 --> 20:36.454
It's okay.

20:46.372 --> 20:48.132
No.

20:51.711 --> 20:53.387
Okay.

20:56.132 --> 20:58.059
God, I'm tired.

21:01.012 --> 21:02.480
I'll stay up.

21:10.980 --> 21:12.823
You go to sleep.

21:28.331 --> 21:30.341
Go to sleep.

21:47.225 --> 21:49.819
- Joe, you got a minute?
- Later, huh?

21:51.646 --> 21:53.614
I'd kind of like to
talk to you now.

21:53.940 --> 21:56.126
Look, I don't think you're being
very reasonable about this.

21:56.150 --> 21:58.087
- I don't think this range is...
- I said later.

21:58.111 --> 21:59.046
It'll only take a sec...

21:59.070 --> 22:00.756
I got other things to
worry about, Charlie.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.123
I'll talk to my client.

22:02.949 --> 22:04.333
Well?

22:04.617 --> 22:07.346
Getting a lawyer involved
just antagonized the S.O.B.

22:07.370 --> 22:08.879
He's not budging, Joe.

22:11.207 --> 22:12.893
You in trouble or
something, man?

22:12.917 --> 22:16.220
If he thinks he's getting somebody else in
here to pay that kind of rent, he's crazy.

22:16.796 --> 22:18.723
200 percent increase.

22:19.257 --> 22:20.943
19 years we've been here.

22:20.967 --> 22:23.561
Yeah, he's got you over a
barrel, Joe, and he knows it.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.313
The landlord?

22:25.847 --> 22:27.866
I thought we had a 10-year
lease on this place.

22:27.890 --> 22:33.372
Well, you did, but then your dad had a bad year
a few years back, and he renegotiated a lease.

22:33.396 --> 22:37.835
And what he should have done was taken out
a small loan or a second on the house.

22:37.859 --> 22:39.535
It was a mistake.

22:40.028 --> 22:44.457
He got short-term relief, and now...
we're at this guy's mercy.

22:46.075 --> 22:47.386
Dad did that?

22:47.410 --> 22:51.432
You know, if I jack up the
prices, then I lose customers,

22:51.456 --> 22:54.476
and if I cut prices, then I
don't make enough profits,

22:54.500 --> 22:58.804
and if we move, it's like
starting all over again.

22:59.589 --> 23:01.390
So he screwed up, huh?

23:03.926 --> 23:07.239
Hey, Bay, is it so much to ask that
you put my wet stuff in the dryer

23:07.263 --> 23:08.574
when you want to do a load?

23:08.598 --> 23:10.149
Julia...

23:13.978 --> 23:15.414
This is Officer Garret.

23:15.438 --> 23:17.365
We're looking for
Peter Strickler.

23:17.565 --> 23:20.451
P.K. I'm his mother. Is he here?

23:20.860 --> 23:23.245
- No, he's not.
- But he was?

23:23.404 --> 23:26.759
We know he was here as of early this
morning, because we traced a phone call

23:26.783 --> 23:29.168
from your residence to Mrs.
Strickler's home.

23:29.452 --> 23:32.797
He called to let me know he
was okay, and not to worry.

23:34.916 --> 23:37.186
- He was here, yes.
- But he left.

23:37.210 --> 23:39.970
He was gone when we
woke up this morning.

23:41.047 --> 23:45.059
He left. Take a look.
He slept on the sofa.

23:46.094 --> 23:48.646
You can see for yourself.
He's not here.

23:48.930 --> 23:51.617
- Is he coming back?
- No.

23:51.641 --> 23:55.486
He mentioned something about a friend.
Uh, he was going to crash there.

23:55.561 --> 23:57.164
I don't know the guy's name.

23:57.188 --> 24:00.658
If you see him or hear from him, you
need to contact the station immediately.

24:00.900 --> 24:05.246
He's a missing person and a minor. Housing
him could have serious implications.

24:05.822 --> 24:08.791
If you know where he is, you have a
responsibility to report his whereabouts.

24:09.575 --> 24:11.252
We'll be sure to
do that, Officer.

24:12.703 --> 24:15.005
Uh, Mrs. Strickler...

24:17.041 --> 24:19.301
P.K. told me what's
been going on at home.

24:21.796 --> 24:23.764
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:25.007 --> 24:27.685
He told me about his
stepfather, how he hits him.

24:28.344 --> 24:29.979
Hits him?

24:31.139 --> 24:34.275
Well, that's a bit
of an exaggeration.

24:34.350 --> 24:36.745
That boy is out of control.

24:36.769 --> 24:39.456
My husband does what he
can to keep him in line.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.041
I saw what he does.

24:41.065 --> 24:42.408
Julia...

24:43.192 --> 24:44.952
He's your son.

24:46.654 --> 24:49.457
You tell him to come home, okay?

24:58.875 --> 25:01.478
Look, it's not as bad as
you make it out to be.

25:01.502 --> 25:03.605
Really? Give me the plus side.
I'm all ears.

25:03.629 --> 25:06.275
Well, first of all, I'm at my
mom's half the time anyway.

25:06.299 --> 25:09.111
Great, so every other week I
can see you whenever I want.

25:09.135 --> 25:14.741
And I have a million after-school activities, from
track to junior class, every one of them an alibi.

25:14.765 --> 25:16.785
He doesn't need to know
where I am all the time.

25:16.809 --> 25:19.445
He'll find out. He has ways.

25:20.062 --> 25:24.293
All right, so we'll meet in the
shadows, hide from a world

25:24.317 --> 25:25.627
that wants to keep us apart.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.953
I'm glad you're not
over-dramatizing this.

25:28.029 --> 25:30.549
I just don't like the feeling
of not being trusted, you know?

25:30.573 --> 25:33.385
Bailey, this isn't even about you.
I'm his only kid.

25:33.409 --> 25:35.794
He thinks he lost me
after the divorce.

25:35.995 --> 25:39.089
Laying down the law is the only way
he knows how to show he cares.

25:39.248 --> 25:42.009
It's kind of confused,
but it's him.

25:42.668 --> 25:44.855
I'm sure he'll warm up to you.

25:44.879 --> 25:46.982
Yeah. Right.

25:47.006 --> 25:48.682
Hey.

25:49.133 --> 25:53.103
He doesn't have to fall
in love with you. I do.

25:58.476 --> 25:59.860
Charlie...

26:00.519 --> 26:04.082
All right, the cobwebs have cleared.
I got it all figured out.

26:04.106 --> 26:05.626
We're not going to
close the place.

26:05.650 --> 26:06.877
Joe, wait. Just listen to me.

26:06.901 --> 26:11.924
Now, I don't know if that means raising the prices
a little or putting out a couple more tables,

26:11.948 --> 26:15.969
or maybe doing some more advertising,
but I do know that, um...

26:15.993 --> 26:19.672
it's gonna be a lot more work,
and I also know that you and I,

26:20.581 --> 26:23.759
have got to put our problems
behind us, so what do you say?

26:25.461 --> 26:28.013
- Joe, come on.
- What?

26:28.756 --> 26:31.600
What, are you not
seeing what's going on?

26:31.759 --> 26:33.769
I mean, you were
there last night.

26:34.136 --> 26:38.232
You're not happy with me, and...
and I don't want this.

26:39.558 --> 26:42.570
I'm done. I'm not
doing it anymore.

26:42.937 --> 26:44.321
You've got to be kidding me.

26:44.647 --> 26:45.582
Joe, I...

26:45.606 --> 26:47.783
You going to walk out on me now?

26:49.443 --> 26:54.582
Oh. Oh, excuse me. I forgot
who I was talking to.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.960
Hey, you know what? I am sick of you
telling me what's wrong with me,

26:58.494 --> 27:02.590
and I'm fed up with being reminded every day
that I'm not half the man my father was,

27:03.124 --> 27:06.719
especially when it turns out when he
wasn't everything he was cracked up to be.

27:07.712 --> 27:10.097
I'm not the one who
screwed up your business.

27:10.923 --> 27:15.269
Blame that on the management whiz, the guy who
never lost his cool, saw everything coming.

27:16.053 --> 27:18.105
My father did this to you.

27:19.432 --> 27:21.317
Why don't you sit down?

27:22.101 --> 27:24.111
Come on, go ahead.

27:33.279 --> 27:37.333
This place is about to go under.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.627
Your dad's place.

27:39.744 --> 27:41.596
Now, you tell me

27:41.620 --> 27:45.924
that you're going to stick around and
help me save it or you're going to walk.

27:47.418 --> 27:48.437
Joe...

27:48.461 --> 27:52.264
Because I want to see
just how selfish you are.

27:55.134 --> 27:56.685
Selfish.

28:03.434 --> 28:04.985
Are you kidding me?

28:06.771 --> 28:12.660
I live in his house, I take care of
his kids, I work in his restaurant.

28:13.903 --> 28:17.915
I'm 24 years old. I have a right to
figure out what I want out of my life.

28:20.701 --> 28:22.503
I came through for you, Charlie.

28:23.371 --> 28:25.422
Are you going to come
through for me or not?

28:40.221 --> 28:42.606
- Mr. Bishop.
- Bailey.

28:43.391 --> 28:46.119
What are you, uh... What
are you doing here?

28:46.143 --> 28:48.988
I was, uh... hoping you might
have time for a match.

28:49.522 --> 28:50.823
Uh, for a set.

28:51.357 --> 28:52.950
For a round.

28:53.359 --> 28:57.162
Uh, you know, to hit
a few balls, sir.

28:57.822 --> 28:59.498
This is a private club, son.

28:59.865 --> 29:03.168
Look, uh, we don't have to play
or anything if you're tired.

29:03.244 --> 29:06.422
Maybe we could just have a couple
iced teas and hang out a little.

29:06.956 --> 29:09.768
Kate tells me that your
specialty is maritime law.

29:09.792 --> 29:10.852
That's always interested me.

29:10.876 --> 29:12.312
How does someone get into that?

29:12.336 --> 29:14.054
What are those,
basketball shoes?

29:14.255 --> 29:17.943
Oh. Yeah. Well, it was either
these or cleats, so I figured...

29:17.967 --> 29:19.309
Look, uh,

29:21.345 --> 29:25.149
you want to play tennis, at least
get yourself a pair of shoes.

29:27.226 --> 29:28.620
No, thank you, sir.

29:28.644 --> 29:30.195
I don't want your money.

29:31.939 --> 29:35.743
Then what do you want?
What are you doing here?

29:38.571 --> 29:41.591
I know you don't have a very good
impression of me, sir, so I figured

29:41.615 --> 29:43.510
that maybe if you got to know
me a little better, then...

29:43.534 --> 29:44.845
Oh, I think I know you
pretty well, son.

29:44.869 --> 29:49.923
I'm only asking for a few seconds, Mr. Bishop,
to let you know just what kind of guy I am.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.845
See, when something
goes wrong, I fix it.

29:55.504 --> 29:58.483
I make sure that my little sister's
got her milk money in the morning

29:58.507 --> 30:00.559
and that all our doors
are locked at night,

30:00.718 --> 30:04.396
and you know what, Mr. Bishop? I don't
have a clue what I'm good at besides that,

30:04.555 --> 30:06.982
but it seems to me that
should count for something.

30:11.437 --> 30:14.406
That, and the fact that
I am nuts about Kate,

30:14.732 --> 30:18.044
and I'd think that'd make me exactly the kind of guy
a father would want his daughter to go out with,

30:18.068 --> 30:21.455
and the fact that you don't think so means
that you don't know anything about me.

30:22.156 --> 30:23.916
Nothing at all.

30:31.123 --> 30:33.133
I don't know, Charlie.

30:34.293 --> 30:36.053
I mean, do we have to?

30:36.212 --> 30:38.263
Yeah, I think so, Claud.

30:38.506 --> 30:39.983
Bay, don't you think so?

30:40.007 --> 30:41.600
Think so what?

30:41.675 --> 30:43.195
That we've got to do something.

30:43.219 --> 30:44.613
I wasn't there this
morning, but...

30:44.637 --> 30:45.739
No.

30:45.763 --> 30:46.948
No, we've got to.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.200
Hey, there you guys are.

30:48.224 --> 30:50.911
Listen, we ordered pizza for dinner,
so we're going to go pick it up.

30:50.935 --> 30:53.695
Hey, you know what, Jule? We've got
some stuff we've got to talk about.

30:53.854 --> 30:55.489
P.K., you mind?

30:57.441 --> 30:59.159
Yeah, no problem.

31:00.820 --> 31:02.371
That ought to cover it.

31:13.082 --> 31:14.675
What was that all about?

31:19.213 --> 31:20.315
We, uh...

31:20.339 --> 31:22.307
We don't think P.K.
should stay here anymore.

31:22.424 --> 31:23.767
What?

31:24.093 --> 31:26.228
I heard about what happened
with the police this morning.

31:26.345 --> 31:28.647
Yeah, so we had a little scare.

31:28.764 --> 31:30.200
We could get in big trouble.

31:30.224 --> 31:31.660
We're not going to
get in trouble.

31:31.684 --> 31:32.994
You don't know that, Julia.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.319
He's a minor.

31:34.478 --> 31:36.780
He's missing and the police
are looking for him.

31:37.147 --> 31:39.709
No, you can't be serious. I can't
believe you would do this.

31:39.733 --> 31:40.919
Bailey...

31:40.943 --> 31:42.087
Be reasonable, Julia.

31:42.111 --> 31:44.329
We're not exactly on
steady ground here.

31:45.030 --> 31:48.083
I mean, if they find out we lied to the
police, who knows what they'll do to us.

31:48.242 --> 31:51.128
They might decide Charlie wasn't
being a good enough parent.

31:54.582 --> 31:56.133
Please don't do this.

31:57.668 --> 31:58.969
Please?

31:59.628 --> 32:01.471
Where else is he going to go?

32:01.630 --> 32:03.265
There must be places.

32:03.591 --> 32:05.777
I mean, if he's being abused,
I'm sure there are places.

32:05.801 --> 32:08.061
You're sure there are places?
That's great.

32:08.888 --> 32:10.814
You guys are really brave.

32:13.017 --> 32:16.153
You know how it must feel
to not have anyplace to go?

32:18.105 --> 32:19.573
Please.

32:22.359 --> 32:24.119
Please.

32:37.875 --> 32:40.636
The kid made it clear she didn't
want me smoking in the house.

32:42.546 --> 32:45.933
You know, I was thinking, In a little
while, I might go up the street

32:46.133 --> 32:47.768
and get some ice
cream for you guys.

32:48.302 --> 32:50.229
Kind of a thank you.

32:56.226 --> 32:58.987
P.K., you can't stay with us.

33:02.900 --> 33:04.451
What did I do?

33:05.069 --> 33:07.871
Nothing. You didn't do anything.

33:11.367 --> 33:13.585
It's because of what happened
with the police this morning.

33:15.663 --> 33:17.015
All right.

33:17.039 --> 33:19.591
My family kind of
freaked about that.

33:21.168 --> 33:23.971
Your staying here,
it's kind of risky.

33:25.255 --> 33:28.360
See, the Department of Social Services,
they check up on us all the time,

33:28.384 --> 33:30.227
and if they found out,

33:31.303 --> 33:33.397
well, they might not
let us stay together.

33:35.683 --> 33:37.693
Sure. I understand.

33:38.852 --> 33:40.362
I'm sorry.

33:42.189 --> 33:45.158
Don't sweat it. I've got plenty
of friends who can put me up.

33:45.776 --> 33:47.411
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:47.486 --> 33:49.579
There's Johnny Brancotto.

33:50.239 --> 33:51.581
He's cool.

33:51.615 --> 33:54.710
I would've went there in the
first place, but, you know,

33:54.827 --> 33:58.380
I figured they'd look for me there,
but it's been a few days, so...

33:58.539 --> 34:00.674
Yeah, he'd definitely
let me hang.

34:05.921 --> 34:09.391
You think maybe I could,
uh, stay in your garage?

34:12.719 --> 34:14.146
Guess not, huh?

34:14.804 --> 34:16.315
Never mind.

34:17.391 --> 34:19.109
Tell someone.

34:20.643 --> 34:22.404
Don't tell me what to do, okay?

34:22.603 --> 34:24.072
I'm not your problem.

34:24.898 --> 34:26.491
You saw my mom.

34:28.068 --> 34:31.204
You saw her. She's never
going to kick him out. Ever.

34:34.283 --> 34:35.958
What are you going to do?

34:36.409 --> 34:38.378
Well, I've made it
this far, haven't I?

34:38.536 --> 34:40.839
So just don't worry
about me, okay?

34:53.342 --> 34:56.313
Hey. You got a minute?

34:59.391 --> 35:02.027
It's the rest of what I
owe you from the loan.

35:03.145 --> 35:04.654
$2,000.

35:05.856 --> 35:09.409
I can't pay you back for all the times
you've come through for me, Joe,

35:09.902 --> 35:13.330
but at least we're
square on the money.

35:13.489 --> 35:15.332
- Come on, Charlie.
- Take it.

35:16.325 --> 35:19.429
I won't leave you in the lurch.

35:19.453 --> 35:21.755
I'll train my replacement
before I go.

35:22.831 --> 35:24.925
And, listen, I...

35:26.668 --> 35:29.606
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me. I really do.

35:29.630 --> 35:32.484
This isn't a personal thing.

35:32.508 --> 35:34.601
It is personal, Charlie.

35:34.802 --> 35:38.438
- Joe...
- I don't want the money.

35:39.348 --> 35:42.359
And I don't want to talk
about who owes who what.

35:42.518 --> 35:44.037
That was stupid of me.

35:44.061 --> 35:46.321
Joe, you got to cut
this out, man.

35:47.106 --> 35:52.536
You think that I moved you up to manager because
there was nobody else I could find to do the job?

35:57.116 --> 36:02.587
Charlie, I wanted to do for you
what your old man did for me.

36:02.746 --> 36:06.883
He took me in, he taught me the
business, he made me a partner.

36:11.505 --> 36:13.598
He was my best friend.

36:15.050 --> 36:16.528
I know he was.

36:16.552 --> 36:19.938
Yeah, and you kids,

36:20.055 --> 36:23.233
you're the only ones I
got, and that place...

36:25.018 --> 36:28.363
is the one thing that I have
that I can leave behind,

36:28.730 --> 36:30.166
and, uh...

36:30.190 --> 36:34.119
maybe it's dumb, but I
wanted to leave it to you.

36:35.237 --> 36:37.038
The way your dad would have.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.254
Lopez.

36:44.872 --> 36:45.932
Rock 'n' roll.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.632
Salinger.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.396
Okay, Julia, here's your salary,

36:51.420 --> 36:56.192
it's in there, and I split tips based on how
many hours and days you worked, so you worked...

36:56.216 --> 36:57.944
- Just Saturday.
- Just Saturday.

36:57.968 --> 37:01.188
20, 40, 60, 80, 100.

37:01.597 --> 37:03.241
- Go crazy.
- Thanks.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.524
All right.

37:04.558 --> 37:05.869
Okay. Reviewing.

37:05.893 --> 37:09.321
Red wine, white
wine, water glass.

37:09.563 --> 37:10.707
Okay.

37:10.731 --> 37:12.000
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

37:12.024 --> 37:15.035
You remember Gil, right? He
applied for a job last week.

37:15.485 --> 37:16.912
Oh, yeah.

37:17.738 --> 37:19.706
Charlie told you your hours?

37:19.781 --> 37:22.501
Five o'clock means five
o'clock, not 10 after.

37:22.993 --> 37:24.669
Well, what do you mean by...

37:24.912 --> 37:27.432
What's he mean by five o'clock?
I thought was going to work...

37:27.456 --> 37:29.549
Gil's going to handle
the lunch shift.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.436
The dinner shift's my gig.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.178
It's better tips.

37:33.462 --> 37:35.899
Hey, just go on and take off.
I'll take care of this stuff.

37:35.923 --> 37:37.432
Great. Thanks.

37:43.013 --> 37:44.648
You're staying?

37:45.098 --> 37:46.775
I'm staying.

37:47.768 --> 37:50.195
How long? For the long haul?

37:50.854 --> 37:54.866
For now. I don't want to see this restaurant
go down the tubes without a fight.

37:58.528 --> 38:01.915
He would be very happy to know
that it means something to you.

38:02.783 --> 38:05.710
It does, but, uh...

38:06.912 --> 38:09.381
I'm telling you something,
Joe, and I want you to listen.

38:09.665 --> 38:12.717
This isn't where I see
myself ending up.

38:12.751 --> 38:14.636
It's not what I want for myself.

38:15.087 --> 38:19.808
I'm not him, and I'm staying
behind the bar. That's it.

38:20.884 --> 38:23.061
I hope that's enough for you.

38:37.192 --> 38:40.036
- What you doing?
- Reading comprehension.

38:41.446 --> 38:45.510
"The main idea of this article
is, A, the American government

38:45.534 --> 38:48.096
frequently broke its
promises to the Indians,

38:48.120 --> 38:51.756
or B, Arizona is
no place to live."

38:52.916 --> 38:55.468
- Any problems?
- I can handle it.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.096
I don't want to
take up your time.

38:58.630 --> 39:00.807
- Hey.
- Just kidding.

39:00.966 --> 39:02.392
Just a joke.

39:02.718 --> 39:05.395
I'll let you know if I have any
problems with my math homework.

39:05.721 --> 39:07.022
Okay,

39:07.472 --> 39:12.027
but I'm telling you right now, I don't know
anything about that base 3, base 4, base 5 stuff.

39:12.102 --> 39:13.945
Dad didn't know
that stuff either.

39:15.731 --> 39:17.490
Well, then I guess
I'm off the hook.

39:21.945 --> 39:24.914
Don't you think Dad would have
known what to do to help P.K.?

39:26.533 --> 39:29.878
I don't know, Claud. I
mean, sometimes there just

39:31.163 --> 39:33.089
aren't any good answers.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.800
I bet he would have
known what to do,

39:37.085 --> 39:39.763
like that time Gretchen
Bassett kept beating me up,

39:39.963 --> 39:42.891
and I wanted to learn how to
box so I could beat her up.

39:43.633 --> 39:49.189
Instead, Dad took us both out to lunch and the
movies, and we became best friends for two years,

39:50.098 --> 39:52.442
until she had to
move to New Jersey.

39:54.436 --> 39:56.780
Dad would have figured
something out.

39:59.983 --> 40:03.453
Yeah. I bet he would have.

40:15.082 --> 40:17.258
I never brought anyone
home to meet my folks.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.428
- No?
- No.

40:22.381 --> 40:27.352
Well, friends, guys, but girls?

40:29.179 --> 40:31.731
I never really had
anyone before you.

40:35.769 --> 40:38.279
You know what would have happened
if I had brought you home?

40:39.398 --> 40:42.877
Right off, my dad would have made you stay for
dinner. Didn't matter if you'd already eaten.

40:42.901 --> 40:44.661
What would he make?

40:45.737 --> 40:48.415
Something with all of your
favorite stuff in it,

40:49.491 --> 40:55.422
and then he would have named it after you,
like Veal a la Kate or Pasta a la Kate.

40:56.248 --> 40:58.133
He was always doing
stuff like that.

41:01.169 --> 41:05.306
Of course, he'd want to know where
you stood on the garlic issue.

41:05.465 --> 41:09.102
None, a little, or there
can never be too much.

41:09.845 --> 41:12.814
C. Definitely C.

41:20.439 --> 41:24.784
He would have made you tell him the
stupidest joke you had ever heard

41:26.903 --> 41:29.414
and he would've been totally
interested in your running.

41:32.367 --> 41:36.713
And he would have showed you some gizmo
that he'd bought off the TV, like...

41:38.081 --> 41:40.550
Something we all thought
was stupid, like a...

41:41.293 --> 41:44.095
like a rock polisher
or something.

41:47.340 --> 41:49.559
And when he thought
I wasn't looking,

41:51.595 --> 41:54.981
he would have winked at my mom
across the table, like...

41:56.099 --> 42:01.070
"Good for Bay. He's
found someone great."

42:05.484 --> 42:09.078
Look. There's Cassiopeia.

42:12.657 --> 42:14.626
He would have loved you.

42:18.788 --> 42:21.049
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.926
- No.
- Please?

42:28.715 --> 42:30.099
Please.

42:32.093 --> 42:34.312
Take it. I want you to have it.

42:44.689 --> 42:46.115
Thanks.

42:49.945 --> 42:51.579
Where will you go?

42:53.782 --> 42:55.458
I don't know.

42:56.826 --> 42:59.003
I was thinking about
trying to find my dad.

42:59.955 --> 43:01.756
He's in New Orleans somewhere.

43:05.043 --> 43:07.095
Well, you've got to go, huh?

43:08.296 --> 43:10.181
My break's almost over.

43:35.323 --> 43:37.584
You take care of yourself, okay?

43:39.953 --> 43:41.462
Okay?

43:49.671 --> 43:51.139
Okay.
