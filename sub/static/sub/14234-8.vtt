WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.993
You wanna blame somebody?
Why don't you blame
your father?

00:03.503 --> 00:05.562
CARTER: Way I heard it,
he brought this on himself.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.705
The target's been expanded.
They want us to take out
the entire family.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.209
No one told me
there'd be a baby.

00:11.311 --> 00:12.369
BLOOM: You had your orders.

00:12.445 --> 00:14.037
And that's
what you did, right?

00:14.180 --> 00:16.512
You're safe here. I promise.

00:16.950 --> 00:17.974
We need to go!
There's someone here.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.249
Hold on to your hats.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.718
This is your Iife now.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.317
The President and I have
our differences,

00:25.525 --> 00:30.588
but the idea of me having
anything to do with trying
to kill him is absurd.

00:35.135 --> 00:38.901
ANCHOR: Today,
a new development in the story
of Avias Flight 514.

00:38.972 --> 00:42.135
As we reported earlier,
Brazilian separatists
aboard the plane

00:42.208 --> 00:45.666
released a biological agent,
prompting an
emergency landing.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.071
The 183 passengers were
then moved

00:48.148 --> 00:51.606
to a stateside quarantine
facility for examination.

00:51.918 --> 00:55.820
And now, after much fear
and uncertainty, those
passengers are going home.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.617
But one of them won't be
so fortunate.

00:58.691 --> 01:02.218
Michael Buchanan,
the pilot who navigated
the plane to safety,

01:02.295 --> 01:05.492
died in quarantine
from injuries he suffered
in the crash.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.591
Today he is remembered
as a hero.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.172
The domestic intelligence
apparatus of this country
has one priority.

01:14.274 --> 01:17.903
That is to find Sophia
and the man we know as Thomas.

01:17.977 --> 01:23.074
But no Iess important
are the rest of them who have
been Iiving secretly among us.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.981
The sleepers,
as you call them.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.149
What I want to know is,
why has that not
been accomplished?

01:29.222 --> 01:30.951
We don't even know
how many sleepers are
out there,

01:31.124 --> 01:33.115
or how deeply
they've infiltrated
our country,

01:33.193 --> 01:35.923
or what kind of threat
they represent. Nothing.

01:36.429 --> 01:40.661
Mr. President, please bear
in mind the search operation
has really just begun.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.234
We weren't aware Thomas
and the sleepers existed

01:43.303 --> 01:44.634
until several days ago.

01:44.704 --> 01:47.798
To me, that just means
we dropped the ball.

01:49.642 --> 01:51.473
It's very difficult,
Mr. Vice President,

01:51.544 --> 01:53.512
to find something
you don't know
you're Iooking for.

01:55.548 --> 01:57.641
Until then, there's still
the assassination attempt
against you

01:57.717 --> 02:01.084
at Coral Gables,
where we do have
a promising Iead.

02:01.754 --> 02:02.743
What's your Iead?

02:02.856 --> 02:04.881
The pilot.
Michael Buchanan.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.051
But you interviewed the pilot.
He didn't tell you anything.

02:08.627 --> 02:11.688
Other than the fact that
he was forced into what he did
by the murder of his wife

02:11.798 --> 02:12.890
and the abduction
of his daughters.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.693
That doesn't mean
that's all he knows.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.732
Buchanan and the passengers
became ill before I could
interrogate him further.

02:20.540 --> 02:22.667
I intend to remedy
that now.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.674
AII right, BIake.
Let's pursue it.

02:25.745 --> 02:28.043
But I want to talk
to him first.

02:28.114 --> 02:32.483
He intended to murder
me and my family and 200
innocent people on that plane,

02:32.585 --> 02:35.452
and he's going to tell me
who put him up to it.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.311
AII right?

02:52.972 --> 02:54.940
You don't know
how sorry I am, sir.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.706
But you have to believe me.
I didn't have a choice.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.743
Everyone has a choice.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.709
They were going
to kill my girls.

03:02.782 --> 03:05.945
So instead, do you think
it's okay to kill 200 people
on that plane

03:06.019 --> 03:07.953
and me and my family?

03:09.155 --> 03:11.419
You made a choice.
You decided that was okay.

03:12.825 --> 03:14.850
After what they did to me,

03:19.465 --> 03:22.457
please understand,
I wasn't in my right mind.

03:26.439 --> 03:27.997
I don't know
what else to tell you.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.775
What you can tell me,

03:36.382 --> 03:38.441
is how I catch the people
who did this to you.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.352
I've told your people
everything I know.

03:41.421 --> 03:45.118
Think. They took you
from your house. You had
to have seen something.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.182
They put something
over my head.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.625
Heard something then.
Anything.

03:51.197 --> 03:52.858
Hey, Iisten to me.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.900
I'm a father.

03:56.002 --> 03:58.630
I get it. I know
how concerned you are
about your daughters.

03:59.606 --> 04:03.770
And I give you my word,
I will do everything
in my power to find them.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.277
But you have to give
me something.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.139
I, um...

04:17.890 --> 04:18.982
What?

04:21.628 --> 04:23.391
They almost didn't go
through with it.

04:23.930 --> 04:26.023
What do you mean? Why not?
I don't know.

04:26.199 --> 04:28.724
But before they put
me on the plane,

04:28.801 --> 04:31.429
they were thinking
of calling
the whole thing off.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.867
But then a call came in
giving them
the go-ahead, so...

04:39.145 --> 04:41.113
So you say this happened
before the plane took off?

04:42.181 --> 04:43.546
Yeah? Okay.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.579
I need you to remember this.

04:45.652 --> 04:49.383
Do you remember what time
that call came in,
the go-ahead call?

04:50.890 --> 04:52.118
1:08 p.m.

04:52.558 --> 04:53.786
I remember because
I Iooked at my watch

04:53.860 --> 04:56.385
to see how much time I had
before departure.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.521
But I didn't hear
the conversation.

05:01.267 --> 05:04.100
I don't know how that could be
of any help to you.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.705
I'm afraid I do know.

05:16.549 --> 05:17.777
Hi, Eva.

05:18.017 --> 05:22.681
The President interviewed
the pilot from Avias 514 this
morning, Michael Buchanan.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.279
Can you pull up
the transcript for me, please?

05:29.462 --> 05:30.759
I'm sorry, sir.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.855
I can't gain access to it.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.298
What do you mean?
Shouldn't be
a clearance problem.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.928
It's been restricted
to the Executive
Office of the President.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.941
Well, very well, then.
I'II be in my office.

06:12.538 --> 06:13.527
Who wants cake?

06:13.606 --> 06:15.836
Hi, Christina.
I'm gonna have to pass
on the cake.

06:16.409 --> 06:18.741
CHRISTINA: Okay, no cake
for the Vice President,

06:18.811 --> 06:21.644
but everyone else wants
some, right?
CHILDREN: Yeah!

06:21.714 --> 06:22.703
CHILDREN: Me! Me!

06:22.782 --> 06:24.773
What it comes down to is,

06:25.184 --> 06:28.847
we don't have
enough information to feel
safe enough to Iet them out.

06:28.921 --> 06:31.981
Guys, it's too Iate.
The information is
already out there.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.425
AII right, then, fine!
Let the public find out.

06:36.262 --> 06:37.889
Just please, EIi,

06:39.632 --> 06:41.361
don't Iet them out.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.668
I'm sorry
if this makes you all feel
uncomfortable,

06:45.738 --> 06:48.798
but these people have
suffered enough.
We're closing the facility.

06:49.842 --> 06:51.275
In two hours,

06:51.444 --> 06:53.935
I'm going out there and
I'm going to tell
the American people the truth.

06:54.647 --> 06:56.308
This ends today.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.583
I need a moment
in private, Martin.

07:18.037 --> 07:19.026
(PHONE RINGING)

07:20.306 --> 07:21.967
Where do we stand?

07:22.241 --> 07:25.074
I just Ieft the President.
He won't budge.

07:26.212 --> 07:29.010
He's going through
with the announcement.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.509
I'm very sorry
to hear that.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.475
I didn't want it
to come to this.

07:33.553 --> 07:37.751
Neither did I.
But the President has Ieft
us no choice.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.490
We have to stop him
from releasing the detainees.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.796
I keep thinking about
those people on the plane,

07:46.699 --> 07:47.791
some of them were children.

07:48.701 --> 07:52.262
Raymond, we're doing this
to prevent something worse.

07:52.672 --> 07:58.304
Martinez releasing
a dangerous, unknown enemy
into our midst.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.408
I know.

08:04.550 --> 08:08.577
You've been a
great public servant
for our country, Ray.

08:10.289 --> 08:13.087
But sometimes
we don't choose the moment.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.550
It chooses us.

08:19.298 --> 08:22.756
The plane will be
in the air soon. You need
to leave the compound.

08:45.558 --> 08:46.547
(SHOUTING)

08:59.338 --> 09:00.828
Are you okay?

09:28.434 --> 09:29.423
Come on!
Come on!

09:29.535 --> 09:30.797
Where are we going?
Hurry, hurry.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.902
Where are we going?
Listen.
Okay. Okay.

09:32.972 --> 09:36.237
We're on to something
or they wouldn't be
chasing us. Okay?

09:36.943 --> 09:38.808
So we're getting
closer. We're gonna
figure this out.

09:39.078 --> 09:42.343
So what, we're just gonna be
Iike them and keep Iooking
over our shoulders

09:42.415 --> 09:44.508
everywhere we go?
No, no, no, no.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.211
No. Listen, Iisten.

09:46.285 --> 09:50.051
I'm gonna make sure that
I do everything I possibly
can to untangle this mess

09:50.122 --> 09:52.488
so that we can get back
to Iiving our Iives.
We're gonna get older...

09:52.558 --> 09:56.289
Wait. Look, Iook.
Stop, stop, stop.
Look at me. Look at me.

09:57.063 --> 10:01.625
It's okay. Hey, hey!
Look at me. We're gonna
be all right.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.793
We're gonna be okay.
Okay?

10:04.870 --> 10:09.864
I Iove you so much
that I'm gonna do
everything. Okay?

10:12.578 --> 10:15.843
I Iove you.
Yeah. I Iove you.

10:20.319 --> 10:22.082
Hey, these companies are
in Los Angeles,

10:22.154 --> 10:24.179
and they are our only Iead
to finding your family.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.155
So that's where we need
to get. We need to get
to California.

10:27.526 --> 10:31.986
How are we gonna get there?
We have no money.
We have no ID.

10:32.064 --> 10:34.828
And these people,
they have more power

10:34.900 --> 10:36.162
than we can even understand.

10:36.235 --> 10:38.100
It's okay, it's okay.
We'II figure it out.
Okay?

10:38.170 --> 10:39.262
God!
We're gonna figure
it out.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.339
We're gonna figure it out,
Leila. It'II be fine.
You've got to...

I say "okay."

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.545
Just get his gun.
Get his gun.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.009
Got it.
We got to go.

11:35.795 --> 11:36.784
We have to get
out of here.

You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get
you to a hospital.

No, no, no, no.
We can't go to a hospital.

12:31.784 --> 12:34.480
They have to report all
gunshot wounds to police.
And when they do that,

12:34.720 --> 12:37.348
they'II realize that
there's a warrant out for me.
I'm wanted for murder.

Sean, no!
We don't have a choice.
Okay?

14:16.088 --> 14:17.248
I was.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.848
And how is he doing?
Much better.

14:18.924 --> 14:22.587
He's out of the ICU.
He should be discharged
in a day or two.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.590
PIease.

14:27.099 --> 14:28.464
You're a good friend, BIake.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.030
I'm not his friend,
I'm his boss.

14:32.104 --> 14:34.800
He was hurt in the Iine
of duty, so...
Not to Agent Lee. To me.

14:36.976 --> 14:38.170
Remember that meeting
we had

14:38.244 --> 14:40.542
just before I was
about to give the press
conference at Coral Gables?

14:41.614 --> 14:44.447
Of course, I was
the one who requested it.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.713
I now know that someone
in that room, or someone
closely connected to them,

14:48.787 --> 14:51.381
gave the go-ahead
and the green Iight
to send the pilot.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.282
What?

14:53.359 --> 14:56.658
Michael Buchanan told me
he got the go-ahead
to fly into the compound

14:56.729 --> 14:59.527
four minutes after
the meeting dispersed.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.561
But I know
it wasn't you, BIake.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.409
How can you be so sure?

15:12.478 --> 15:16.005
Well, I know the personal toll
disloyalty has taken on you.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.912
I don't think
you're capable of that.

15:17.983 --> 15:19.780
It's not who you are.

15:19.952 --> 15:22.386
But I also had the NSA monitor
every phone call

15:22.488 --> 15:25.218
and every communication
coming into and out of
the Coral Gables compound

15:25.291 --> 15:27.691
on the day of the
assassination attempt.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.449
You're clear.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.893
So the key to finding
who we're Iooking for

15:33.666 --> 15:35.463
is somewhere in these records.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.298
AII right, EIi.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.771
We'II find him.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.007
(PHONE RINGS)

15:54.186 --> 15:55.278
It's me.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.254
Raymond, what can I do
for you?

15:57.323 --> 15:58.483
The President.

15:58.557 --> 16:01.025
He's just had a meeting
with the pilot.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.115
And?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.659
And since he's returned,

16:04.229 --> 16:07.687
President Martinez and
Director Sterling have been
behind closed doors.

16:09.268 --> 16:11.259
What exactly is the problem?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.399
I can't find out
what the President heard
from the pilot.

16:16.342 --> 16:19.800
The transcripts, I've tried
to access them,
but they've been redacted.

16:20.546 --> 16:21.672
I've been cut out of the Ioop.

16:22.481 --> 16:24.972
Well, I understand
you're concerned.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.176
Well, you tell me
I shouldn't be.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.380
Your people handle
that side of things.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.817
Does the pilot know anything
that could Iead back to me?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.788
Not that I'm aware of.

16:35.861 --> 16:36.987
Not that you're aware of?

16:37.796 --> 16:40.560
James, if I'm exposed,

16:42.735 --> 16:44.327
I'm not gonna go down alone.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.004
Nobody is being exposed.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.332
My misguided sense
of patriotism Ied me astray

16:51.410 --> 16:52.934
to participating
in this with you,

16:53.012 --> 16:54.536
and almost making
the biggest mistake
of my life.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.274
But you know what?

16:56.482 --> 17:00.384
The President and
the passengers,
they survived.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.483
I've been absolved.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.916
And I'm not about
to go down now.

17:06.058 --> 17:10.085
Raymond. Raymond,
I know this has been hard.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.021
But I assure you,

17:13.098 --> 17:15.589
nothing bad is going
to happen now.

17:15.834 --> 17:18.325
How? How can you assure
me of that?

17:21.607 --> 17:24.132
This is not a secure means
of communication.

17:25.911 --> 17:28.812
Let's continue
this conversation in person.

17:29.681 --> 17:30.670
As soon as possible.

17:31.316 --> 17:34.877
Very well. I can meet
in a half an hour.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.817
Let's use our usual cover,

17:36.889 --> 17:39.187
schedule an appointment
with Dr. Lessner.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.555
I can't do it that soon.

17:40.759 --> 17:43.353
But you're the one
who feels this is urgent.

17:43.495 --> 17:46.794
The Appropriations Committee
is coming in for a meeting,
I have to meet with them.

17:46.932 --> 17:49.366
If I'm not there
it'II Iook suspicious.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.632
Whatever works for you,
Raymond.

17:52.871 --> 17:54.634
The choice is yours.

18:06.452 --> 18:09.751
Our country is
in desperate need
of strong leadership

18:11.990 --> 18:14.390
that can look past party lines

18:14.760 --> 18:18.252
and respects what
the American flag stands for.

18:20.332 --> 18:23.460
We will restore
America's pride,

18:24.002 --> 18:26.436
here at home
and around the world.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.673
We will make
you believe again.

18:30.909 --> 18:32.501
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

18:33.679 --> 18:35.271
And that's a promise.

18:36.648 --> 18:38.013
Thank you!

18:38.217 --> 18:40.208
And God bless America!

18:40.452 --> 18:42.079
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

18:55.634 --> 18:58.501
Senator Jarvis, great
speech, sir.
Thank you.

18:58.570 --> 19:00.697
One of our major
contributors is here.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.831
I was wondering
if you can speak to him
for a few minutes.

19:02.908 --> 19:04.671
Absolutely.
AII right. This way.

19:05.043 --> 19:06.169
MAN: Well done, Senator.

19:06.245 --> 19:07.576
Thank you.

19:09.448 --> 19:10.972
Right this way.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.449
Thank you.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.544
Mr. Dempsey!

19:16.722 --> 19:19.589
Senator. Senator,
thank you...
PIease, please, don't get up.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.920
Thank you. Thank you
so much for making
the time to see me.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.693
Well, not at all. I never
thought I'd get a chance
to thank you in person

19:26.165 --> 19:27.962
for supporting my campaigns.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.362
I prefer to stay
out of the spotlight.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.671
That was a very
energizing speech.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.740
Yes. Very,
very inspiring.

19:38.076 --> 19:39.407
Thank you.

19:40.546 --> 19:43.344
It's such a shame
that you couldn't
clinch the nomination.

19:45.217 --> 19:49.176
There'II be other
opportunities. Right now, it's
all about mobilizing our base.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.321
It's all about
the big picture.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.823
I couldn't agree more.

19:53.625 --> 19:57.652
Unfortunately your party
is going to Iose the White
House to Senator Martinez.

19:58.330 --> 19:59.388
Well, we don't know that.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.726
But I do.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.827
It's a done deal.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.135
What's not a done deal,
however,

20:08.440 --> 20:09.805
is his running mate.

20:11.610 --> 20:16.104
Martinez is Iooking to create
the first bipartisan ticket
in modern history.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.445
Yes, I've heard
the rumors.

20:18.517 --> 20:21.111
If there is someone
who can reach
across the aisle,

20:21.920 --> 20:27.483
bridge the gap between
Martinez's party and ours,
it's you, Raymond.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.523
You're the perfect candidate.

20:35.767 --> 20:38.736
Well, speaking
hypothetically,

20:40.272 --> 20:42.467
why would you do this
for me, Mr. Dempsey?

20:42.541 --> 20:44.168
It's not for you.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.408
It's for this country.

20:47.980 --> 20:51.040
I know you feel the same way
about this country as I do.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.107
Martinez...

20:55.887 --> 20:57.684
Is idealistic to a fault.

21:01.627 --> 21:02.958
AII I would ask of you

21:04.196 --> 21:05.390
is to provide

21:08.100 --> 21:09.328
balance.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.436
Well, I have confirmation
on General Whitman.

21:22.714 --> 21:24.944
The only call he made
after the meeting
was to his wife.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.542
They spoke for 20 minutes,
well past 1:08 p.m.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.318
He's clean.

21:30.756 --> 21:31.916
BIake?

21:33.592 --> 21:34.991
It's Jarvis.

21:38.230 --> 21:41.666
We've cleared all the people
who knew what happened
in that meeting except him.

21:43.168 --> 21:46.103
My associates, Jarvis' aide,
Whitman's aide,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.230
and now Whitman.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.232
Jarvis' records show
that he used his
personal cell phone

21:51.310 --> 21:53.471
to make a call at 1:05 p.m.

21:53.945 --> 21:55.936
And the call was scrambled.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.606
Can we decode it?
No.

21:58.183 --> 22:00.310
Looks Iike he was using
a proprietary algorithm,

22:01.186 --> 22:03.746
several grades
above military-grade
encryption.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.588
This is not government-issued
technology.

22:07.826 --> 22:11.728
His call Iasted two minutes,
it ends at 1:07 p.m.

22:12.631 --> 22:15.794
A minute Iater, the pilot gets
the green Iight.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.830
After all we went through
together during the campaign.

22:24.376 --> 22:26.606
The man is Iike family to me.

22:27.979 --> 22:30.573
Believe me, I know
this is difficult.

22:31.283 --> 22:33.683
Sir, the Vice President
made that call,

22:33.752 --> 22:36.516
but I find it hard to believe
he formulated the plan.

22:37.856 --> 22:40.916
Jarvis is an insider,
but he's not a Ieader.

22:41.393 --> 22:44.055
And not someone with
the resources to do something
Iike this on his own.

22:45.464 --> 22:48.365
Someone else has to be
pulling the strings.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.993
I'II have Jarvis arrested.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.962
We have no grounds,
Mr. President.

22:53.038 --> 22:55.370
We'II figure out how
to unscramble the call...

22:55.440 --> 22:59.103
Maybe. But even if we did,
we covered up the
assassination attempt.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.372
You can't prosecute
someone for something
that never happened.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.576
No, right now
the best thing is to be
patient.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.880
I can put together
a small investigative unit,

23:07.953 --> 23:10.285
set up wire taps
and round-the-clock
surveillance.

23:10.389 --> 23:11.378
No.

23:12.257 --> 23:13.246
Hell no!

23:13.825 --> 23:15.417
Sir, wait.

23:15.961 --> 23:19.192
Sir, think this through,
you can't just
go and confront him.

23:19.264 --> 23:22.131
I'm not just gonna sit
on my damn hands, and wait
until he slips up one day.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.327
That man ordered my death
and the death of my family.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.598
He's gonna answer for that.
He's gonna answer to me.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.399
Get him out here. Now!

23:28.507 --> 23:29.496
I'm sorry?

23:30.942 --> 23:32.273
Mr. President...

23:34.980 --> 23:36.777
Eva, where is he?

23:37.282 --> 23:40.183
I'm not sure.
He Ieft just
a few minutes ago.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.550
He had me cancel
his Appropriations
Committee meeting,

23:42.621 --> 23:45.021
he said he needed
to go see his doctor.

23:45.090 --> 23:46.990
Which doctor?
What's the address?

23:47.058 --> 23:48.855
I'm sorry, I don't...

23:50.061 --> 23:52.154
He made the appointment
himself.

23:52.230 --> 23:54.289
I don't have
that information.

23:56.001 --> 23:57.263
Find him.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.644
Look, he needs a hospital.
Let me turn around.

24:06.711 --> 24:08.941
I already told you,
that's not an option.

24:09.514 --> 24:11.505
Without an OR,
he's gonna bleed out.

24:11.583 --> 24:13.813
Then you're gonna
help him, all right?
You took an oath.

24:13.985 --> 24:17.011
Look, I need supplies,
medications, IV fluids.

24:17.355 --> 24:18.686
We're gonna go somewhere

24:18.757 --> 24:20.349
where you can get
whatever you need
to fix him

24:20.425 --> 24:21.915
and then we're gonna
go back to your house,

24:21.993 --> 24:23.460
and you're gonna work
on him there.

24:24.229 --> 24:25.253
What?

24:25.330 --> 24:28.026
You heard me.
Drive.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.514
I don't even know
if a pharmacy is going
to have what we need.

24:45.851 --> 24:47.716
Just Iet's go,
okay? Get out.

24:47.853 --> 24:49.081
You're just gonna Ieave
him in here?

24:49.154 --> 24:50.746
I can't Iet you go
in there by yourself.
No, no.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.312
You stay here, okay?

24:52.390 --> 24:54.051
You talk to him,
elevate his arm.

24:55.026 --> 24:56.994
You can trust me,
I promise.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.459
I can't trust anyone.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.322
Move.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.170
Excuse me.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.674
There's the pharmacy.

25:21.753 --> 25:25.917
Look, whatever your
boyfriend did, it's not worth
risking his Iife over, okay?

25:26.124 --> 25:27.614
He didn't do anything.

25:27.692 --> 25:29.421
Great. So it's
a misunderstanding?

25:29.494 --> 25:31.826
You have nothing
to worry about. We should
go back to the hospital.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.531
We should just explain
everything to the police.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.528
What do you think,
we didn't try that?
Nobody believes us.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.135
You wouldn't understand.

25:54.920 --> 25:55.909
(GROANS)

25:55.987 --> 25:56.976
(CAR DOOR OPENING)

25:58.757 --> 26:00.952
It's going to Iook
suspicious ifyou're just
standing there.

26:01.459 --> 26:03.427
(WHISPERING) Yeah,
you know, just go.

26:04.829 --> 26:06.854
Can I help you?
Yeah. Hi.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.292
Bernard. I'm
Doctor Matt Kemp.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.132
I need a gram
of ceftriaxone,

26:14.406 --> 26:16.397
two Iiters of saline
and some tubing.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.566
Let me make sure we have
the ceftriaxone.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.100
We do.

26:21.179 --> 26:23.841
AIso, do you maybe have
an intraosseous Iine?

26:23.915 --> 26:26.816
We should. We usually keep
a small supply in our
home-health inventory.

26:26.885 --> 26:30.412
Great, great. I'm also
gonna need a 10-blade,

26:30.789 --> 26:35.385
some sterile 7 gloves,
Betadine, 5-0 Vicryl suture,

26:37.395 --> 26:42.697
an 18-gauge syringe
and five packs of sterile
four-by-fours.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.101
Is that it? Sounds Iike
you're setting up
a whole OR.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.397
It does, doesn't it?

26:49.741 --> 26:50.799
Hey.

Thank you, Audra.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.143
I picked her up
outside of Houston.

28:38.083 --> 28:41.746
I had to take care
of a few things. My mother
needed help with something.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.145
I was gonna report in

I'm trying to cut sugar
out of my diet.

29:33.738 --> 29:36.229
I'm interested in what
happened in Texas

29:36.775 --> 29:39.107
with the pilot's daughter
and her boyfriend.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.810
That was unfortunate.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.180
I barely made it
out of there alive.

29:46.451 --> 29:48.851
Your associate, Carter,
said as much.

29:50.021 --> 29:51.420
However, he...

29:52.423 --> 29:56.257
Wasn't sure how
they pulled off their escape.

29:57.862 --> 30:00.023
Seemed to feel
they may have had inside help.

30:00.098 --> 30:02.965
No. We were just
caught off-guard.

30:03.935 --> 30:08.065
Walker and the Bureau woman
arrived ahead of schedule,
and they came in firing...

30:08.673 --> 30:10.470
But you managed
to get away.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.032
As did Carter.

30:13.711 --> 30:14.871
I see.

you're ready to resume
your work.

30:43.741 --> 30:44.833
Yeah.

30:48.980 --> 30:51.574
Will that be a problem,
Miss Roberts?

30:53.918 --> 30:54.907
Only for him.

31:11.269 --> 31:12.429
Sir, the building's been
swept.

highest discretion

31:49.107 --> 31:50.870
in a matter pertaining
to the Vice President.

31:51.342 --> 31:53.674
I want him brought back
here immediately.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.613
Patch in. Talk to his detail.
He's needed,
with the utmost urgency.

31:59.651 --> 32:01.175

32:03.321 --> 32:04.447

32:05.356 --> 32:07.517
I don't care.
Get him out of there.

is everything all right?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.165
Sir?

32:21.839 --> 32:23.170
He's gone.

32:25.643 --> 32:29.409
Sir, the Vice President,
he's not in the doctor's
exam room.

32:32.016 --> 32:33.142
What are you saying?

32:33.217 --> 32:34.206
He's gone.

32:36.387 --> 32:38.787
How in the hell
is that possible?

32:38.990 --> 32:40.855
There was another door
Ieading out of the room.

32:41.893 --> 32:43.986
Mister President...
Establish a perimeter.

32:44.395 --> 32:47.592
Activate every available
field agent and expand
that perimeter.

32:47.732 --> 32:50.929
Comb every inch.
Do not come back without him.

33:30.575 --> 33:32.543

to help you...

34:03.041 --> 34:04.668
Your Iife for Dempsey's.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.334
You need to come clean now.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.411
Tell him how he was behind
trying to kill the President.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.141
Listen, I don't know
how he wronged you...

34:13.217 --> 34:15.150
Dempsey played us both.

34:15.786 --> 34:17.812
He sold you on patriotism.

34:18.289 --> 34:20.917
But that's not
what this is really about.

34:21.926 --> 34:23.951
Or what he's really after.

34:27.297 --> 34:29.061
What are you saying?

34:30.467 --> 34:31.730

Maybe the police took him.

Maybe he's inside
