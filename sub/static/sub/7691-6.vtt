15:45.436 --> 15:49.827
Harry, he... He tried
to crawl through it.

15:49.941 --> 15:52.330
He fell down
a vent and died.

15:56.314 --> 15:58.703
Aw, look, man.

15:59.617 --> 16:02.199
We're all gonna be dead
before we find any gold.

16:03.654 --> 16:05.394
Just like Harry.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.319
You better eat something.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.863
l wouldn't feed
this stuff to a dog.

16:24.976 --> 16:26.921
Well, you're not
helping yourself any.

16:27.011 --> 16:28.353
lf you really
wanna get out of here,

16:28.446 --> 16:30.346
you have to keep
up your strength.

16:30.448 --> 16:33.599
l don't plan on
staying here long
enough to starve.

16:33.718 --> 16:35.663
Remember l told you
that wasn't my car?

16:36.421 --> 16:38.002
Well, it belongs to
this guy in LA,

16:38.122 --> 16:39.589
a real big shot in
the record business.

16:39.690 --> 16:41.954
Mmm-hmm:
lf l told you
his name, you'd just die.

16:42.060 --> 16:43.721
Well, see,
l met him when
l was looking for a job,

16:43.828 --> 16:45.978
and one thing just
kind of led to another,

16:46.097 --> 16:49.487
till l found
myself in Vegas
about to get married.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.670
Everything was going
real fine until, uh,

16:51.769 --> 16:55.557
the other night the phone
rang in the hotel
and it was his wife calling.

16:55.673 --> 16:57.140
Oh.
Mmm-hmm.

16:57.241 --> 16:58.981
So l took
his wheels and split.

16:59.944 --> 17:03.175
And l got
a funny feeling
he's gonna want them back.

17:03.781 --> 17:04.930
Yeah.

17:06.184 --> 17:08.414
Well, one way or another,
we're gonna get out of here.

17:08.519 --> 17:11.339
And that Mr. Ross
is gonna be in
a lot of trouble.

17:11.455 --> 17:13.845
Just as soon as
Jack finds his car.
Mmm-hmm.

17:13.925 --> 17:16.473
Roy took care
of that hours ago.

17:17.929 --> 17:19.078
Now, is there
anything else l can do

17:27.505 --> 17:31.817
These, uh,
clothes may not fit you
exactly like your own,

17:31.909 --> 17:35.857
but, uh, l assure you
that you're gonna find
them functional.

17:35.980 --> 17:37.083
Real functional.

17:37.181 --> 17:38.489
Somebody's gonna find us.

17:38.583 --> 17:40.403
You can't just
hide a whole town.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.224
No, no.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.107
But l can hide you
in the mine.

We deeded the land to me.

35:09.599 --> 35:12.466
l quit my job, remember?

35:12.569 --> 35:15.800
You own the land in name
because l'm a convict.

35:15.906 --> 35:17.931
But don't you go
getting the idea that

35:18.041 --> 35:19.508
you can run
this thing yourself,

35:19.609 --> 35:21.031
because you can't.
Why not?

35:21.144 --> 35:24.693
Because without me
telling you what to do
every minute of the day,

35:24.781 --> 35:27.727
you'd screw up everything,
just like today.

35:27.851 --> 35:30.479
You are nothing.
Remember that.

35:30.587 --> 35:32.657
Nothing without me.

35:32.756 --> 35:35.702
Now, you get out of
my face, boy!

36:03.653 --> 36:05.393
(GRUNTlNG)

36:08.124 --> 36:10.274
Once again. Ready?
All right.

36:10.360 --> 36:11.622
Go!

36:14.598 --> 36:17.419
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.587
...thinking he can make
a fool out of me.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.540
What's going on here?

36:25.642 --> 36:27.507
Why ain't you sleeping?

36:32.015 --> 36:35.963
You folks think
you're pretty smart,
don't you, huh?

36:36.853 --> 36:38.798
About as smart as Harry.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.561
Back in prison,
we knew how to take care of

36:42.659 --> 36:45.321
smart alecks like you.

36:45.662 --> 36:48.005
Didn't take no guff
from anybody.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.141
Not when l was a guard,
l didn't.

36:54.337 --> 36:56.885
No, they jumped
when l snapped.

37:01.945 --> 37:04.209
Even ol' lsaac shuffled.

37:06.750 --> 37:11.983
Thinks he's a big man now,
a real big man.

37:12.555 --> 37:14.864
Yeah, he wasn't so big

37:14.958 --> 37:17.461
when he needed me
to bust him loose.

37:19.562 --> 37:21.666
Couldn't have done
it without me.

37:22.265 --> 37:24.415
lsaac giving you
a rough time?

37:26.036 --> 37:30.587
Yeah, yeah... But that...
That's all gonna change.

37:30.774 --> 37:31.957
l...

37:32.309 --> 37:34.698
l got me some plans.

37:35.178 --> 37:37.646
What kind of plans,
Mr. Darnell?

37:37.747 --> 37:39.647
(MOCK LAUGHTER)

37:41.117 --> 37:44.746
Come tomorrow,
this whole place
is gonna be

37:44.854 --> 37:48.403
one big rock pile.

37:49.826 --> 37:51.976
Well, what about
the gold?

37:52.095 --> 37:53.756
Oh, it'll still be here.

37:53.863 --> 37:58.812
We'll just bring in
some heavy equipment
and get it out.

37:58.935 --> 38:00.800
And what happens to us?

38:01.838 --> 38:03.783
Why... Why, honey.

38:05.141 --> 38:07.245
You're gonna stay
right here.

38:09.346 --> 38:10.847
(ROY LAUGHlNG)

38:25.195 --> 38:26.696
MARTY: Come on,
give it to me!

38:45.281 --> 38:47.863
DAVlD: Roy has
dynamite, lsaac.

38:48.184 --> 38:49.526
(LAUGHlNG)

38:50.453 --> 38:54.446
You know, l used to
lay in my bunk at night
in prison just thinking,

38:54.557 --> 38:57.264
just wondering
what it was gonna be
like when l found this.

38:57.360 --> 38:58.509
The freedom
it was gonna give me...

38:58.595 --> 39:01.143
No, lsaac, that's not
freedom. That's another
kind of slavery.

39:01.231 --> 39:03.734
No. No, this gold means
being able to have

39:03.833 --> 39:06.939
the choice to live
my own life
the way l want to.

39:07.036 --> 39:08.936
That's very good for you.
We don't have that choice.

39:09.038 --> 39:10.983
And if you don't stop him,
you won't have any either.

39:11.107 --> 39:15.009
lSAAC: Ah, you shouldn't
believe everything Roy says.
He's all mouth.

39:15.145 --> 39:17.045
Oh, hiya, lsaac.

39:17.447 --> 39:21.156
Oh, l mean, uh,
Mr. lsaac.

39:21.618 --> 39:23.324
lSAAC: You're late.

39:23.653 --> 39:27.601
Oh, well, excuse me,
but l was up
kind of late last night

39:27.724 --> 39:30.272
with your slaves here.

39:31.294 --> 39:34.479
Seems like they were
getting a bit uppity.

39:34.597 --> 39:36.906
Tried to
bust out again.

39:37.600 --> 39:41.104
But don't you
worry your shiny
little head none.

39:43.106 --> 39:45.006
'Cause l fixed things.

39:45.108 --> 39:49.181
Oh, yeah,
l fixed 'em real good.

39:49.279 --> 39:50.746
You get out of here.

39:50.847 --> 39:53.031
You're in no condition
to work.

39:53.149 --> 39:56.812
Oh, l don't work.
l's the overseer.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.865
You get up to your room.
Sleep it off.

39:58.988 --> 40:02.776
There you go, telling me
what to do again.

40:02.859 --> 40:06.010
l don't got to take this.

40:06.095 --> 40:07.244
No, why should you?

40:07.363 --> 40:09.308
After all,
you're partners,
you're equal.

40:09.432 --> 40:11.377
That's enough
out of you, David.

40:11.501 --> 40:14.732
Now, you do as l say.
You get up to your room
and sleep it off.

40:14.838 --> 40:16.226
You're no good drunk.

40:16.339 --> 40:17.840
You're not
much better sober.

40:17.974 --> 40:20.716
Yeah, l'll sleep it off,
all right.

40:22.111 --> 40:23.976
We'll all sleep it off.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.805
Sweet dreams.

(ROY LAUGHlNG)

40:41.231 --> 40:43.335
So you're sure
he's not making
a fool of you, hmm?

40:43.433 --> 40:45.742
l told you not to
worry about it.

40:46.035 --> 40:48.856
We used all the dynamite
when we opened up
this shaft, here.

40:48.972 --> 40:50.394
lSAAC: Now,
don't mess with me.

40:50.507 --> 40:51.656
l'm worried.

40:51.741 --> 40:53.606
He said he was gonna
blow us all up.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.975
Roy is a drinker, Marty.
He talks a lot.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.947
Look, it won't hurt
to just check it out.

41:00.049 --> 41:02.119
We're gonna be here anyway.

41:03.920 --> 41:06.502
l think you should go,
Mr. Ross.

41:07.991 --> 41:09.492
Roy's a coward.

41:11.528 --> 41:13.473
He'll always do as l say.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.740
You're sure you
can believe that?

41:19.435 --> 41:21.096
lf you're right...

41:22.105 --> 41:24.209
Well, then the game
is over.

41:32.649 --> 41:35.550
All right, come on.
We have no time to waste.

41:49.766 --> 41:50.869

Put that down.

42:07.584 --> 42:08.972
lSAAC: Stop it! Stop it!

42:11.321 --> 42:12.902
Catch!

42:50.493 --> 42:51.915
Come on,
give me a hand!

42:52.028 --> 42:54.770
This whole thing's
gonna go. We gotta
get out of here!

42:54.897 --> 42:57.161
Now! Come on!

43:11.681 --> 43:13.262
David!
Look, he's dead.

43:16.352 --> 43:19.742
They're both dead.

46:08.291 --> 46:09.918
That ought to do it.

the Sheriff's station.

46:14.597 --> 46:15.825
(SlGHS)

46:17.200 --> 46:19.509
Maybe he just took off,
you know?

46:19.802 --> 46:21.986
No, see, David
wouldn't do that.

46:22.104 --> 46:25.335
He'd stay and help us,
like he stayed in the mine.

46:25.441 --> 46:27.386
And that's why
he's dead.

46:29.212 --> 46:30.759
Come on.

46:38.521 --> 46:40.512
lf it wasn't for you
and your games,

46:40.623 --> 46:42.693
we wouldn't be
in this fix.

46:42.792 --> 46:44.259
We'd be rich.

46:44.961 --> 46:47.145
lnstead, we're
going to prison.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.913
Well, the price of arrogance.

46:52.335 --> 46:53.677
(SlGHlNG)

46:56.505 --> 46:58.894
Feels good to be
in a truck again.

looking for a new partner.

47:05.147 --> 47:06.648
What about you?

47:10.119 --> 47:11.620
l'm going home.
