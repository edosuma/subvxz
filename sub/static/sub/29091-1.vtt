         (guns firing)
        (sirens wailing)

00:27.094 --> 00:30.562
    (tense orchestral music)

00:33.067 --> 00:34.633
         (guns firing)

00:34.635 --> 00:35.634
            - Fuck!

00:36.771 --> 00:37.770
           The gate.

00:52.453 --> 00:53.502
         - Right, boys.

00:53.503 --> 00:54.552
      I think this is it!

00:54.553 --> 00:55.602
- What do you mean, this is it?

00:55.603 --> 00:56.652
 How the fuck did this happen?

00:56.657 --> 01:00.059

01:00.061 --> 01:02.061
           (grunting)

01:02.063 --> 01:04.730

01:12.306 --> 01:13.405
      - Sergeant Spitter.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.505
   - [Man] What's up, Darcy?

01:14.506 --> 01:15.605

           You ready?

01:17.166 --> 01:18.722

 (light acoustic guitar music)

01:33.627 --> 01:34.526
        (phone ringing)

01:34.528 --> 01:35.394

01:42.435 --> 01:44.368
     How's everything goin'

01:44.371 --> 01:46.772
- Oh yeah, we're good over here,
             buddy.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.675
     - Hey, you don't mind,
      like to eat tonight.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.643
- You just ate an entire bag of
            Doritos.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.462
      - So, I'm on a diet.

01:53.463 --> 01:55.280
  It's called the fuck you and
         feed me diet.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.316
 I've already gained 20 pounds.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.251
  - Everything all right over
             there?

01:59.253 --> 02:01.031
            - Yeah.

02:01.032 --> 02:02.810
Everything's good over here man,
             just,

02:02.811 --> 02:04.589
   trying to get some huntin'
  in before the season closes.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.125
  Gotta feed fat boy somehow.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.660
- Yeah, I gotta deal for us, big
             money.

02:08.662 --> 02:11.597
   I'm gonna need you down at
  the shop tomorrow, two p.m.

           You down?

02:13.234 --> 02:14.533
           - No shit?

02:14.535 --> 02:15.868
All right, yeah, I'll be there.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.169
        - [Darcy] Roger.

02:17.171 --> 02:18.737
       I'll see ya then.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.189
  - You gonna try and tell me

02:20.190 --> 02:21.640
there's no such thing as a fifth
             meal?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.408
You made up some major problems.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.244
 - There is no such thing as a
          fifth meal.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.745
 Literally fat people make it a
             thing

02:26.747 --> 02:28.547
    so they had an excuse to
            overeat.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.883
           (thudding)

02:33.420 --> 02:34.820
        - Son of a dick!

02:36.590 --> 02:39.658
       (tense rock music)

02:41.295 --> 02:42.628
       - [Jesse] Hey now.

02:42.629 --> 02:43.962
   - Bag on that fool, dude.

02:43.963 --> 02:45.296
 - T-bag him, dude, T-bag him.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.165
            - Spent.

02:46.167 --> 02:46.832
        (phone ringing)

02:46.834 --> 02:48.167
          Oh, hold on.

02:49.703 --> 02:51.587
      Yo, what up, Darcy?

02:51.588 --> 02:53.472
     Is there a reason your
  beautiful face is callin' us

02:53.474 --> 02:55.240
   while we're hard at work?

02:55.242 --> 02:57.376
- Yo, Darcy, where you at, man?

02:57.378 --> 02:58.594
           Come over.

02:58.595 --> 02:59.811
  We're getting high as fuck.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.180
            - Baby.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.548
- [Darcy] I have more important
           shit to do

03:02.549 --> 03:03.916

              day

03:03.917 --> 03:05.284
   like you two fuckin' life
            wasters.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.419
   - Hey, it's a great career
          choice, bro.

03:07.421 --> 03:09.221
         - Tits, money.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.678
 - [Darcy] Listen, fucksticks.

03:10.679 --> 03:12.134
I need you both to get off your
             asses

03:12.135 --> 03:13.590

            two p.m.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.661
   - Yeah, for sure dude, is
        everything okay?

03:15.663 --> 03:16.695
 - [Darcy] Everything is fine.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.363
    I just talked to Outlaw.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.498
      He'll be there, too.

03:19.499 --> 03:20.632
     - Oh, shit, sick dude.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.084
         - Cool, dude.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.535
     We'll see ya tomorrow.

03:25.506 --> 03:28.507
       (faint pop music)

03:29.543 --> 03:30.676
          - Big money.

03:32.313 --> 03:33.479
           Hey, hey!

03:33.480 --> 03:34.646
     - Hey, what's up guys?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.515
 - [Jesse] What are you doin',
             dude?

03:36.517 --> 03:37.916
- I ain't seen y'all in a while.

03:37.918 --> 03:40.419
      - How you doin' man?

03:40.421 --> 03:42.254
- So, you guys know what's goin'
              on?

03:42.256 --> 03:43.989
     - Ah, once he get off

03:43.991 --> 03:44.856
     find out pretty quick.

03:44.858 --> 03:46.245
            - Yeah.

03:46.246 --> 03:47.633
  - Better hurry the fuck up,
             dude.

03:47.634 --> 03:49.021
          I'm hungry.

03:49.022 --> 03:50.409
        - 'Course he is.

03:50.410 --> 03:51.797
  - By the way, how's huntin'
     Bambi goin', asshole?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.732
   You're a real dirty human
     being, you know that?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.267
 - What the fuck is wrong with
          you, Jesse?

03:55.269 --> 03:57.937
You take your medication today?

03:57.938 --> 04:00.606
   - Hey, my medication is my
   daily dose of cholesterol.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.473
          (chuckling)

04:01.475 --> 04:03.642
         I need to eat.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.810
    - Hey, this is gonna be
   the shit, whatever it is.

04:05.813 --> 04:06.678
          - Hey guys.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.002
         How you doin'.

04:08.003 --> 04:09.325
   - [Jesse] Hey, what's up?

04:09.326 --> 04:10.648
- Darcy just got off the phone,
  and he's ready for you now.

04:10.651 --> 04:11.667
        - [Chris] Okay.

04:11.668 --> 04:12.684
    - Have fun on your trip.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.669
        - [Jesse] Trip?

04:13.670 --> 04:14.653
       - What kinda trip?

04:14.655 --> 04:15.654
            - Trip?

04:19.793 --> 04:20.858
             Darco!

04:20.861 --> 04:22.152
             - Hey!

04:22.153 --> 04:23.444
      - [Jesse] Hey, man!

04:23.445 --> 04:24.736
   - [Darcy] What's up, boys?

04:24.737 --> 04:26.028
    - How's it goin', dude?

04:26.033 --> 04:27.032
          'Sup, dude?

04:27.034 --> 04:28.000
     What's goin' on, man?

04:28.002 --> 04:29.057
          - 'Sup, man?

04:29.058 --> 04:30.113
   - [Outlaw] How you doin'?

04:30.114 --> 04:31.169
     - How was your flight?

04:31.170 --> 04:32.225
  Run into any weirdos beside
             Jesse?

04:32.226 --> 04:33.281
          (chuckling)

04:33.282 --> 04:34.337
    - It was all right, man.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.474
          So, tell us.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.610
  What's up with this deal you
              got?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.746
      - Well, I think this
    is our big break, boys.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.648
     I been in contact with
      some big league guys

04:42.650 --> 04:44.449
    about a huge shipment of
            tobacco.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.386
  Talking potentially millions
          every year.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.788
 Sell that shit on our website.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.456
       - So, these guys,

04:52.459 --> 04:53.892
  who do they distribute for?

04:53.894 --> 04:55.360
- Well, they didn't give me any
             names,

04:55.362 --> 04:57.546
      which is fine by me,

04:57.547 --> 04:59.731
     especially for 150,000
   cans of dip for only 100K.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.099
            - Dude!

05:01.100 --> 05:02.466
  That's like, 70 cents a can.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.969
   That's a shit ton of dip.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.505
 - Order it now, next delivery
           that shit.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.207
      They got drones now.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.908
    - It close enough for us
     to check it out today?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.977
 'Cause I wanna flog that shit.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.679
   - Well, that's the thing.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.380
The dealer's in Kentucky and he
           definitely

05:15.381 --> 05:17.081
   won't ship it to us, least
   not the first time around.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.817
    So, we'll have to drive
      across the country,

05:18.819 --> 05:20.485
       pick that shit up.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.821
 Pretty simple plan, if you ask
              me.

05:22.823 --> 05:27.025
 Besides, what's the worse that
          can happen?

05:27.027 --> 05:29.628
- Why do in the hell do we have
  to drive across the country?

05:29.630 --> 05:31.830
- Yeah, why don't we just rent a
             truck?

05:31.832 --> 05:33.398
    Maybe a big yellow one.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.434
           (laughing)

05:35.436 --> 05:37.670
     - Well, I can't get a
     driver 'til next week

05:37.671 --> 05:39.905
   and this deal needs to go
  down in the next four days.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.474
 Second of all, you guys are my
             boys.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.943
    Lastly, I think we need
    to disconnect ourselves

05:44.944 --> 05:47.411
from the negative bullshit goin'
  on in this world right now.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.582
Plus, little R and R won't be so
              bad.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.483
   - What are we rolling in?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.602
           The truck?

05:53.603 --> 05:55.720
     - Nope, we're goin' in
     that thing out there.

05:55.723 --> 05:56.722
            - What?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.361
        Oh my God, dude.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.396
     You can't be serious.

06:04.398 --> 06:06.665
  That was a hobo's outhouse.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.667
 At least tell me it's stocked
          with snacks.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.080
          - No snacks.

06:10.081 --> 06:11.492
      - Where the fuck did
    you even get that thing?

06:11.493 --> 06:12.904
      - Hey man, don't bag
    on it 'til you ride it.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.340
 That thing runs like a champ.

06:15.341 --> 06:17.775
    - So, you're tellin' me
   we gotta pack our shit up,

06:17.778 --> 06:19.611
    leave everything behind,

06:19.613 --> 06:21.513
drive halfway across the country

06:21.515 --> 06:23.582
 to some dude who doesn't even
           like names

06:23.584 --> 06:27.853
 and then pick up 150,000 cans
   of dip to sell for profit?

06:27.855 --> 06:29.554
       - And, no snacks.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.922
        - And no snacks.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.494
          I'm with it.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.561
          - I'm down.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.731
     - Oh damn, road trip?

06:39.733 --> 06:42.601
    - Let go of your cocks,
     pack your socks, boys.

06:42.603 --> 06:44.136
   We're goin' on a dip run.

08:32.645 --> 08:33.979
        This is boring.

Where in the fuck did we get hot
             dogs?

08:40.254 --> 08:42.187
- Man, how long do we have 'til
           Kentucky?

08:42.188 --> 08:45.624
- GPS says we got a couple days,
            bitches.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.926
  Suggest you try meditating.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.828
 - And why can't we turn on the
             radio?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.263
- Maybe we should just take this
              time

08:51.265 --> 08:52.931
   to appreciate each other's
            company?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.866
    - 'Preciate this, dick.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.168
 - Hey, I know what we can do.

08:57.170 --> 09:01.706
We got a whole case of 90 proof
  American made bourbon, baby.

09:01.708 --> 09:02.807
       - Holy shit, dude.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.109
Is that America Barrels bourbon?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.711
       - [Jesse] Mmm-hmm.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.312
  - Last time I drank this, I
  felt like George Washington

09:07.313 --> 09:08.913
  flying a bald eagle over Mt.
            Rushmore

09:08.916 --> 09:10.582
       waving at myself.

09:11.585 --> 09:12.884
    And no hangover, either.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.808
         - [Jesse] Hmm.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.311
    But wait, don't we gotta
     go to Kentucky first?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.346
 Why not just hit it up on the
           way back?

10:48.348 --> 10:52.050
    - Chris, we gotta hit up
     the Culche Club, dude.

10:52.052 --> 10:53.985
     - Damn, you're right.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.054

13:28.008 --> 13:30.542

13:32.412 --> 13:35.013
  - [Jesse] Oh, what the fuck?

13:36.216 --> 13:38.516

You are not getting the drop on
              me!

13:45.492 --> 13:48.193
   (uptempo electronic music)
          (chuckling)

13:48.195 --> 13:49.194

         (tense music)

13:56.436 --> 13:58.036
        - What the fuck?

13:58.038 --> 13:59.571
        - What the dick?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.973
Where the fuck did you guys take
              me?

14:01.975 --> 14:04.426
         - Okay, relax.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.878
  Let's just calmly leave this
          place, now.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.249
 - You boys ready to have some
              fun?

14:11.251 --> 14:13.384
 - No, I think we're gonna call
          it a night.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.320
- You guys ain't goin' nowhere.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.021
 - We know you got some money.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.958
You ain't leavin' 'til you spend
           it on us.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.492
        And guess what?

14:21.494 --> 14:22.894
         I'm pitchin'.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.229
  - But I don't play baseball.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.680
        - Hey, fuck you.

14:25.681 --> 14:27.130
   - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.867
           (thudding)
           (grunting)

14:28.868 --> 14:30.602
Get him off me, get him off me!

14:32.906 --> 14:35.139
    - Guys come on, there's
     a back door back here.

14:35.141 --> 14:38.076
     - Ooh, did I just hear
     someone say back door?

14:38.078 --> 14:38.994
         - Yes, I did.

14:38.995 --> 14:39.911
       (excited mumbling)

14:39.913 --> 14:41.379
       - [Man] Go go go!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.984
- Man, we just had crazy night.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.519
        Check this out.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.053
 Jesse got tranny piss all over
              him.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.989
Chris got cock slapped and Darcy

14:50.991 --> 14:52.590
  well, you know how Darcy is.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.058
 - Hey, tell 'em what you were
              into

14:54.060 --> 14:55.159
   before all that happened.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.661
          - Well, uh,

14:56.663 --> 14:58.046
 hey, crazy shit's going down,
              so,

14:58.047 --> 14:59.430
 we're gonna pack it in for the
             night,

14:59.432 --> 15:02.367
    but catch ya on the next
            venture.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.460
  What the hell just happened?

15:06.461 --> 15:08.717
 Jesse, you said the place was
             legit.

15:08.718 --> 15:10.974
  - Culche's never like that,
    man, but it is 2018 now.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.410
   - Dude, I never said shit.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.912
I went and took a piss and damn
              near

15:13.914 --> 15:15.046
     got raped by a tranny.

15:15.048 --> 15:17.916
        (phone ringing)

15:18.585 --> 15:19.484
        - [Darcy] Hello?

15:19.486 --> 15:21.252
        Hey, what's up?

15:21.254 --> 15:22.921
          Roger that.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.390
 I'll see ya in about an hour.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.826
  - Dude, when I saw that dick
            shadow,

15:27.827 --> 15:29.494
   I was trying not to stare,
         unlike Darcy.

15:29.496 --> 15:31.329
          (chuckling)

15:31.331 --> 15:33.131
          - Fuck you!

15:33.133 --> 15:36.334
     So, I just got word of
     some fast cash, boys.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.936
     There's an underground
      poker game happening

15:37.938 --> 15:39.270
       in about an hour.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.438
          We're going.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.040
        - What the hell?

15:42.041 --> 15:43.641
 After all this shit went down,

15:43.642 --> 15:45.242
 you wanna go to an underground
          poker game?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.644
     - I ain't doin' shit.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.146
     - I'm with them, dude.

15:48.147 --> 15:49.647
      I ain't doin' shit.

15:49.648 --> 15:51.148
    - So, there's no way to
  talk you into it, huh boys?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.150
            - Nope.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.297
           - Nothin'.

15:54.298 --> 15:56.443
 - Well, I guess I'm gonna have
   to enjoy those free drinks

15:56.444 --> 15:58.589
     served up by beautiful
      women all by myself.

15:59.526 --> 16:03.328
   (uptempo percussive music)

16:10.337 --> 16:13.338
     All right, try and act
     normal in this place.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.239
   I hear these guys are some
         serious dudes.

16:15.241 --> 16:17.442
   - Hey, you focus on making
             money.

16:17.444 --> 16:18.977
  We'll focus on bein' normal.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.545
 - Fuck normal, this is Vegas.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.313
 Let's just pretend that we're
            gambling

16:22.315 --> 16:23.614
and they'll keep giving us free
            drinks.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.617
    - [Outlaw] Oh, let's get
           hammered.

16:30.523 --> 16:31.622
         - Hey, Darcy.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.258
     Good to see you again.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.293
           You ready?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.228
     - Yeah, I'm good, Cal.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.162
  We're all kinda countin' on
             this.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.631
    There's a deal I'm into.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.201
 Boys don't know, but I'm short
           about 50K.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.402
            - Relax.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.070
       You got my money?

16:47.173 --> 16:48.272
             Nice.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.274
        You're all set.

16:50.276 --> 16:52.110
   Wait 'til around two a.m.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.478
 That's usually the time these
          high-rollers

16:53.480 --> 16:56.414
 wanna go home, they'll go all
              in.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.150
  You're playin' with a whale
            tonight.

16:59.152 --> 17:02.220
  He hates to fold, like last
             time.

17:02.222 --> 17:05.390
    Gimme the sign and I'll
     create a distraction,

17:05.392 --> 17:09.227
     switch out them cards
    on the table real quick,

17:09.229 --> 17:11.496
     they'll be a couple of
      aces waitin' for ya.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.797
         - Roger that.

17:12.799 --> 17:13.731
          - All right.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.266
        Go get 'em boy.

17:15.801 --> 17:18.536
         (tense music)

17:31.484 --> 17:33.217
          - Hundreds.

17:33.219 --> 17:34.318
         Five hundreds.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.319
           Thousands.

17:37.123 --> 17:39.657
         (tense music)

17:44.764 --> 17:47.832
       (chips clattering)

18:03.817 --> 18:06.551
 - You win some, you lose some.

18:27.507 --> 18:30.475
 - You might wanna fold on this
          one, buddy.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.143
        - I'm committed

18:32.145 --> 18:35.613
      and if that was your
     play to get me to fold

18:35.615 --> 18:38.449
  by throwing all that money,

18:38.451 --> 18:40.118
       well, guess what?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.424
    - Go all in, I'm tired.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.426
      - Do not go all in.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.427
  - Oh, just go all in, pussy.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.763
           (crashing)

18:56.136 --> 18:57.268
          - I'll call.

18:57.270 --> 19:02.807
 And since you're so committed,
     how 'bout another 30K?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.913
          I'm all in.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.581
    It's okay, you can fold.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.184
  You win some, you lose some.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.622
      - If you only knew.

19:20.460 --> 19:21.326
          I'm all in.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.193
- [Chris] Did he just sink 30K?

19:22.195 --> 19:24.662
     - That our fuckin' dip
      deal money, asshole?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.632
    - Don't worry boys, this
      guy don't have shit.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.568
        (dramatic music)

19:31.504 --> 19:32.503
             Fuck!

19:34.774 --> 19:36.607
    What the fuck, asshole?

19:36.609 --> 19:38.543
    - Well, this is one for
      you to go all in on,

19:38.545 --> 19:39.844
   but not for you to win on.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.711
    - [Darcy] You fucked us!

19:40.713 --> 19:42.246
        - Go home, kid.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.918
   - Welcome to Vegas, boys.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.886
 Hope to see ya back real soon.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.296
      - Wait, wait, wait.

19:50.297 --> 19:51.705
      We need that money.

19:51.706 --> 19:53.114
 - [Man] It's time for you boys
             to go.

19:53.115 --> 19:54.523
         (tense music)

20:08.508 --> 20:09.807
 - What the hell just happened?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.710
   Was that our damn dip deal
             money?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.712
       Fuckin' answer the
    question, mother fucker.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.514
     - Who the fuck do you
    think you're talkin' to?

20:16.516 --> 20:18.683
You fucks told me to go all in.

20:18.685 --> 20:20.751
 - We didn't know it was gonna
  be the money from the deal.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.287
    We thought it was just a
    friendly game, asshole.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.323
       - All right, shit.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.025
      Calm the hell down.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.726
   Let's just go grab a beer
           somewhere.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.727
        I can fix this.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.362
      - We just lost 100K.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.464
 How are you going to fix this?

20:33.466 --> 20:34.932
       - I can fix this.

20:35.969 --> 20:39.503
     (upbeat country music)

20:47.647 --> 20:49.914
   - Yeah, I'll have another.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.652
     Hey guys, checkin' in.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.654
 Oh, we got some problems with
           this deal,

20:56.656 --> 20:58.856
    and I reckon this dude's
          handlin' it.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.324
           - Not now.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.104
  - I guess it's just us guys.

21:02.105 --> 21:03.883
    We're sittin' at the bar
     havin' a couple brews.

21:03.884 --> 21:05.662
   'Bout to head home, 'cause
   this journey's about over,

21:05.665 --> 21:08.366
so I reckon catch ya on the next
              one.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.367
            Holler.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.470
           (sighing)

21:12.472 --> 21:14.338
 What the hell are we gonna do?

21:14.340 --> 21:15.990
      - I don't know, man.

21:15.991 --> 21:17.641
   Hopefully, this dumbass'll
     figure somethin' out.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.876
             Soon.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.689
          - I hope so.

21:20.690 --> 21:22.501
 'Cause losing out on this deal

21:22.502 --> 21:24.313
is losing out on a lot more than
             100K.

21:26.552 --> 21:29.954
- So, Vegas got the best of ya,
              huh?

21:29.956 --> 21:32.390
 I'm sorry, I couldn't help but
            overhear

21:32.392 --> 21:34.859
 that you guys lost some money.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.927
 Ah, happens to the best of us.

21:36.929 --> 21:38.929
It happens to everybody at least

21:38.931 --> 21:40.564
   once in a lifetime, right?

21:40.566 --> 21:43.401
     For some others, more
          frequently.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.804
    - Yeah, more frequently
    would be our dumbasses.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.673
 - Let me guess, you lost some
             money

21:48.675 --> 21:52.677
  at a high stakes after-hours
     place down the street

21:52.679 --> 21:54.712
    called the Golden Hole.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.448
 - Wait, what did you just say?

21:58.318 --> 21:59.584
     Who the fuck are you?

21:59.585 --> 22:00.851
 - Yeah, who the hell are you?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.486
 You can't just be imposing on
            peoples'

22:02.488 --> 22:05.022
 misfortunes like that, bitch.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.693
 - If you're with a casino, we
 got nothin' to give you, man.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.494
      We lost everything.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.864
 - Talkin' 'bout the 100 grand.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.600
   I'm not interested in your
             money.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.436
  - How the fuck did you know
          about that?

22:18.438 --> 22:20.037
     - 'Cause it's been the
     same hustle for years.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.840
  They lure you in, they take
          their money,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.909
       they spit ya out.

22:24.911 --> 22:25.910
            But um,

22:28.748 --> 22:31.949
if you're interested, I may know
            of a way

22:31.951 --> 22:34.385
to help you guys get your money
             back.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.620
    - Why the fuck would we
  trust a douche bag at a bar

22:36.622 --> 22:38.622
     to get our money back?

22:40.493 --> 22:44.128
- Well, because like you, I also
            believe

22:44.130 --> 22:46.797
 in the American dream, Darcy.

22:48.134 --> 22:51.469
 - How the fuck did you know my
             name?

22:52.472 --> 22:55.072
- I know a lot of things and one
            of them

22:55.074 --> 22:57.808
 is how to get your money back.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.045
    - All right, random man
  who knows everyone's names.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.147
How the hell do we get our money
              back

23:03.149 --> 23:07.151
and what the fuck do you want in
            return?

23:07.153 --> 23:08.986
'Cause I believe in the American
             dream

23:08.988 --> 23:11.655
and eagles and shit, but why the
              fuck

23:11.657 --> 23:13.657
   are you helping us, again?

23:13.659 --> 23:15.860
     'Cause even though I'm
    drunk, I can still smell

23:15.862 --> 23:18.062
       shit a mile away.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.031
  - And he's good at smellin'
             shit.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.166
          But I agree.

23:23.469 --> 23:25.569
   - This smells funny to me.

23:25.571 --> 23:26.904
I think we need to pack our shit
               up

23:26.906 --> 23:28.806
     and go the fuck home.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.925
         - Wait, wait.

23:30.926 --> 23:33.043
Let's just hear this guy out for
           a second.

23:33.045 --> 23:35.846
  - Well if you are interested
       in hearing me out,

23:35.848 --> 23:38.115
  why don't we find some place

23:38.117 --> 23:41.185
 a little more private to talk,
              huh?

23:42.488 --> 23:44.155
 (suspenseful orchestral music)

23:44.157 --> 23:45.907
           All right.

23:45.908 --> 23:47.658
So I've been planning this for a
             while.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.160
     I've just been looking
   for a crew to help me out

23:49.162 --> 23:50.945
and I've been watching you guys
           all night

23:50.946 --> 23:52.729
   at the casino, and I think
  you might be the right team

23:52.732 --> 23:54.376
          for the job.

23:54.377 --> 23:56.021
  But we're gonna have to move
              fast

23:56.022 --> 23:57.666
   before they move the cash.

23:57.670 --> 23:59.670
    - All right, you got our
           attention.

23:59.672 --> 24:00.671
           - Ah shit.

24:02.809 --> 24:05.943
 - Hey, enough crosstalk, okay?

24:05.945 --> 24:09.480
      Now as I was saying,
   these guys have been at it

24:09.482 --> 24:11.515
      for a long time now.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.818
   And they actually recently
  took me for about 250 grand

24:13.820 --> 24:16.787
    so needless to say, I'm
   eager to get back at them.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.722
     - 250 freaking grand?

24:18.724 --> 24:20.524
      You have a problem?

24:20.526 --> 24:21.826
 I lose 20 dollars and I'm out.

24:21.828 --> 24:23.961
    - Pipe down, John Candy.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.064
  Now I know you guys are just
          average Joes

24:27.066 --> 24:29.700
     but if you're able to
   follow simple instructions

24:29.702 --> 24:31.502
    you should be just fine.

24:31.504 --> 24:34.004
    You just gotta know your
    rights from your lefts.

24:34.006 --> 24:37.074
   Hey, put down the fucking
           Instabook!

24:37.076 --> 24:40.478
   Your fans aren't gonna be
  able to help you out there.

24:40.480 --> 24:43.581
  Guys, you're gonna run into
  some serious shit out there,

24:43.583 --> 24:45.149
 some gangster type characters,

24:45.151 --> 24:47.184
 automatic weapons and whatnot.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.653
 So it would behoove you to pay
           attention.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.689
 - Automatic weapons, what the
             hell?

24:51.691 --> 24:53.691
     I can't believe we're
  listening to this bullshit!

24:53.693 --> 24:54.692
        We have nothing.

24:54.694 --> 24:55.943
      - Yeah, he's right.

24:55.944 --> 24:57.193
- Well the way I look at it is,

24:57.196 --> 24:59.864
what have you got to lose, huh?

24:59.866 --> 25:02.032
 And I have the perfect route,
             okay?

25:02.034 --> 25:04.735
     I know this place like
      the back of my hand.

25:04.737 --> 25:07.538
     There's gonna be some
   guys here, here and here.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.707
  But if you keep on a steady
             path,

25:09.708 --> 25:11.875
 about a half hour to an hour,
  everything's gonna loosen up

25:11.878 --> 25:14.111
    for you guys and you'll
      have a steady track

25:14.113 --> 25:18.582
     nice and clear all the
     way to Grand Central.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.252
   - That's a lot of fucking
           firepower.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.187
   How are we supposed to get
         through that.

25:23.189 --> 25:26.190
   And what the hell is Grand
            Central?

25:26.192 --> 25:28.125
  - It's where your money is.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.227
    Just keep the questions
      until the end, okay?

25:30.229 --> 25:33.097
 Let me just tell you the plan
             first.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.232
  I'm gonna drop you guys off
           right here

25:35.234 --> 25:37.668
    at the south end of the
           warehouse.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.103
   Now once you guys get into
            position

25:39.105 --> 25:40.771
  at the employees only door,

25:40.773 --> 25:43.240
you're gonna be on your own from
             there.

25:43.242 --> 25:45.809
   - How do we know which one
  is the employees only door?

25:45.811 --> 25:47.778
  - It'll say employees only,
            dumbass.

25:47.780 --> 25:48.979
         - Oh, gotcha.

25:48.981 --> 25:53.918
  - Outlaw, here's the keycode
     to the security door.

25:53.920 --> 25:58.055
    Now inside, you're gonna
    use this aerosol device

25:58.824 --> 26:01.225
 to reveal the security lasers.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.327
     You fail at that, the
    place is gonna light up

26:03.329 --> 26:05.829
  like Rockefeller Center, all
             right?

26:05.831 --> 26:08.999
   Now once you disable that
   sensor, you guys are clear

26:09.001 --> 26:11.201
       to open the door.

26:11.203 --> 26:14.572
 Now I'll be watching you guys
           over here.

26:14.574 --> 26:16.173
     Now once you're in the
  clear, you're gonna be able

26:16.175 --> 26:18.109
       to make your move.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.044
 You're gonna need to file down
          the hallway

26:20.046 --> 26:21.312
 and you're gonna need to do it
             quick.

26:21.314 --> 26:24.048
Remember, 30 minutes to an hour

26:24.050 --> 26:25.950
  is all the time you've got,

26:25.951 --> 26:27.851
so you don't have a lot of play
           room here.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.254
 So you're gonna move fast and
             quick,

26:30.256 --> 26:32.990
    but most of all, quiet.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.592
            Got it?

26:34.594 --> 26:36.226
   You guys following so far?

26:36.228 --> 26:37.227
           All right.

26:38.230 --> 26:41.298
       (thunder rumbling)

26:43.135 --> 26:45.636
        (door creaking)

26:45.638 --> 26:48.639
       (device clicking)

27:12.832 --> 27:15.366
         (tense music)

27:25.144 --> 27:26.143
             - Go.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.863
  - [Announcer] No men left on
              base

27:45.865 --> 27:47.998
    after eight more steals.

28:00.012 --> 28:01.812
      - I hate being fat.

28:02.982 --> 28:04.181
         Sorry, sorry.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.066
              Oh.

28:22.068 --> 28:23.067
            Oh shit!

28:24.336 --> 28:26.020
           I pissed!

28:26.021 --> 28:27.705
- Hey dude, you just pissed your
             pants?

28:27.707 --> 28:29.840
    - What the fuck, Jessie?

28:33.779 --> 28:36.113
           (laughing)

28:38.150 --> 28:38.982
            - Stop.

28:38.984 --> 28:41.151
             Stop!

28:41.152 --> 28:43.319
 - Fucking smells like fucking
             lead!

28:55.901 --> 28:57.901
       (pants squishing)

28:57.903 --> 28:59.987
  - You shut the fuck up, piss
              boy.

28:59.988 --> 29:02.072
 Take your fucking shoes off or
           something.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.208
    Hurry up dude, hurry up.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.346
     - Shh, are you ready?

29:09.348 --> 29:10.314
             Okay.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.092
           (clacking)

29:22.094 --> 29:24.795
   (quirky orchestral music)

29:24.797 --> 29:26.797
       - Fucking asshole.

29:26.799 --> 29:27.665
           Oh my god.

29:27.666 --> 29:28.532
 - On my fucking fingers, dude.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.767
          - Sorry man.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.001
      - Shut the fuck up!

29:31.003 --> 29:32.269
  You're gonna get us fucking
            killed!

29:32.271 --> 29:33.837
      - Fuck you, asswad.

29:33.839 --> 29:34.505
 My pants are soaked with piss

29:34.507 --> 29:36.140
        and I'm chafing.

29:36.142 --> 29:39.443
        (all chattering)

29:39.445 --> 29:40.477
            - Guys.

29:40.479 --> 29:41.345
             Guys!

29:41.347 --> 29:42.279
           Dumbasses!

29:42.281 --> 29:43.547
         - Piss in my--

29:44.984 --> 29:46.416
            - Shit.

29:46.418 --> 29:49.153
  - What the hell are you guys
             doing?

29:49.155 --> 29:51.922
 Who let you fucknuts in here?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.991
- We're gonna get to the bottom
             of it.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.793
      Don't fucking move.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.228
       Johnny, come here.

29:58.230 --> 30:01.098
          (gun firing)

30:01.100 --> 30:03.333
     - Shit what happened?

30:03.335 --> 30:05.803
- Holy shit, what the fuck dude?

30:05.805 --> 30:08.071
    I thought you were gonna
    take care of these guys.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.523
       - I did, didn't I?

30:09.524 --> 30:10.974
     - So you used us as a
          distraction?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.376
   - Yeah, sorry about that.

30:12.378 --> 30:13.844
I had to figure out their weight

30:13.846 --> 30:15.112
      for the tranq darts.

30:15.113 --> 30:16.379
   I didn't wanna kill them.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.515
So let's go inside, see what we
              got.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.418
           (grunting)

30:21.420 --> 30:23.086
       - [Chris] Dammit.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.489
         Fucking dick.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.291
      - Okay, here we go.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.460
    I believe this is yours.

30:32.164 --> 30:34.965
 Go ahead and put it in a nice
 little suitcase here for you.

30:34.967 --> 30:38.302
  And you guys will be on your
           merry way.

30:41.841 --> 30:42.840
         There you go.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.692
       - Well shit, man.

30:44.693 --> 30:46.543
   It's definitely a fucking
           challenge.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.178
 - What happened to your shoes?

30:48.180 --> 30:51.014
- Peabody here pissed his pants.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.016
           (laughing)

30:53.018 --> 30:55.085
    - All right, all right.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.820
     Why don't you guys get
      the hell out of here

30:56.821 --> 30:58.554
   and I'll take care of the
     other guys, all right?

30:58.557 --> 31:00.490
         - Thanks, man.

31:00.492 --> 31:01.992
        Here's my card.

31:01.994 --> 31:03.444
      Hit me up sometime.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.895
   Maybe we can repay you for
        helping us out.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.030
- Well it's my pleasure, believe
               me

31:07.032 --> 31:08.866
  and I'm sure our paths will
          cross again

31:08.868 --> 31:10.668
   in a future day, you know.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.469
 The universe is mysterious and
           all that.

31:12.471 --> 31:13.337
      - Thanks again, man.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.688
            - Sure.

31:14.689 --> 31:16.038
  - I didn't catch your name.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.040
            - Susan.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.078
 No names, get the fuck out of
             here!

31:21.080 --> 31:23.514
        (hip hip music)

31:23.515 --> 31:25.949
      ¶ Face reality, so I
   just reminiscence about ¶

31:25.951 --> 31:31.088
    ¶ The good times, yeah ¶

31:32.057 --> 31:34.057
¶ I'm sitting, countin' marys in
           a motel ¶

31:34.059 --> 31:36.093
    - You know, at the end,

31:36.095 --> 31:38.528
  when we were on our fucking
             knees,

31:38.530 --> 31:40.530
  I thought we were done for,
             boys.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.432
 - That was some serious shit,
             dude.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.468
Craziest thing I've ever done in
            my life.

31:44.470 --> 31:48.272
    I never felt that close
     to death before today.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.607
 - I've never smelled piss that
          bad before.

31:50.609 --> 31:51.959
       - [Jesse] Oh yeah?

31:51.960 --> 31:53.310
How's them fingers doing, bitch?

31:53.312 --> 31:54.495
      - [Chris] Fuck you.

31:54.496 --> 31:55.679
 Are we gonna start drinking or
             what?

31:55.681 --> 31:57.915
      Hand me the bottle!

31:57.917 --> 31:59.583
  - Let's get the hell out of
          dodge first.

31:59.585 --> 32:02.119
- Shit, that ain't stopping me.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.353
  - Well that's great for you.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.223
I still got to drive this bitch.

32:07.459 --> 32:09.459
      - Hey, you guys want
     to do something crazy?

32:09.461 --> 32:11.879
   - Shit dude, we just did.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.298
    - Why don't we pick up a
 hitchhiker to drive the RV for
               us

32:14.300 --> 32:15.933
       so we could party?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.251
            - What?

32:17.252 --> 32:18.568
   - I don't know about that.

32:18.569 --> 32:19.885
    You really wanna trust a
           stranger?

32:19.886 --> 32:21.202
   - Come on guys, we're on a
   once in a lifetime dip run

32:21.206 --> 32:23.340
   and we're already a little
      bit behind schedule.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.475
  - Well, this thing is pretty
         easy to drive

32:25.477 --> 32:27.945
     and it would be a good
     idea to have a driver.

32:27.947 --> 32:30.113
 Screw it, let's find someone.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.215
     Keep your eyes peeled.

32:31.216 --> 32:32.316
 - Won't be long on this road.

32:32.318 --> 32:34.451
    I've already seen a few.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.157
       Oh, hold on, wait.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.893
  Right here, there's a dude.

32:42.894 --> 32:45.628
  Man I told you guys, there's
    hitchhikers everywhere!

32:56.608 --> 32:58.041
       - What's up, guys?

32:58.042 --> 32:59.475
  It's your boy Big Rob here.

32:59.478 --> 33:01.278
      Thanks for stopping,
     I've been on this road

33:01.280 --> 33:03.246
for two days looking for someone

33:03.248 --> 33:05.248
     to pick my fat ass up.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.518
- Where are you headed, Big Wob?

33:08.520 --> 33:10.587
- I heard Hawaii's a great place
            to rock

33:10.589 --> 33:12.155
       from time to time.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.113
        - Wait a minute.

33:14.114 --> 33:16.070
 You're hitchhiking to Hawaii,
            Big Rob?

33:16.071 --> 33:18.027
   - Yeah, my coworkers told
  me keep walking on this road

33:18.030 --> 33:20.330
      and I can't miss it.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.400
     - First of all, Hawaii
      is a fucking island.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.536
      Second of all, your
   coworkers don't like you.

33:26.538 --> 33:29.639
And thirdly, get the fuck out of
             my RV!

33:29.641 --> 33:32.042
  - Fuck you guys, and I find
         other bitches

33:32.044 --> 33:34.244
   who'll schnob on my knob.

33:35.547 --> 33:37.097
        (door slamming)

33:37.098 --> 33:38.648
      - Holy shit, you see
    the udders on that guy?

33:38.650 --> 33:40.650
      Man, fuck him, we'll
    find another hitchhiker

33:40.652 --> 33:42.252
  down the road, keep driving.

33:42.254 --> 33:45.322
  - What a weirdo, walking to
            Hawaii?

33:45.324 --> 33:47.357
    Inbreeding is dangerous.

33:47.359 --> 33:48.475
        - I heard that.

33:48.476 --> 33:49.592
   You guys hear that voice?

33:49.595 --> 33:51.461
       Schnob on my nob.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.797
           (laughing)

33:57.302 --> 33:59.269
 - [Outlaw] Oh shit, wait, here
             we go.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.471
          Here we go.

34:01.472 --> 34:03.672
 - Hold on bitches, I'm pulling
             over.

34:08.480 --> 34:11.614
      (upbeat rock music)

34:17.089 --> 34:20.223
      (breathing heavily)

34:21.827 --> 34:23.793
 - Hey what's up, girl, need a
             ride?

34:23.795 --> 34:26.230
            - Fuck!

34:26.231 --> 34:28.665
  Yeah, I've been waiting for
  a ride, all, shit buff, day!

34:28.667 --> 34:29.766
           I'm sorry.

34:29.768 --> 34:31.635
  I don't know what happened.

34:31.637 --> 34:33.303
 - You all right, you want some
             water?

34:33.304 --> 34:34.804
- Yeah, I just have Tourette's.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.239
It's only bad when I'm nervous.

34:37.242 --> 34:38.742
 - This should be entertaining.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.411
     - No, this could work,
     and I'm getting tired.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.847
      Besides, what's the
    worst that could happen?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.532
     - Well, get in, woman.

34:45.533 --> 34:47.216
  The only thing is you gotta
             drive.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.351
 And I didn't catch your name.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.154
  - [Erica] Yeah, I'll drive.

34:51.156 --> 34:54.357
  I'm just happy to be off the
            streets!

34:55.127 --> 34:56.525
        My name's Erica.

34:58.397 --> 35:00.263
    - All right then, Erica.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.288
   Get in the driver's seat.

35:02.289 --> 35:04.312
     I'll teach you all the
           mechanics.

35:04.313 --> 35:06.336
Super easy, just drive nice and
            steady.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.140
   - Is it okay if I use the
   little girl's room first?

35:10.142 --> 35:11.408
         I'm just gonna

35:15.380 --> 35:16.379
             bust!

35:18.417 --> 35:19.783
     - [Darcy] Yeah, sure.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.586
- [Erica] All right, thank you.

35:29.328 --> 35:30.327
          - The fuck?

35:30.329 --> 35:32.796
          (rock music)

35:44.843 --> 35:46.843
     - Are you ready, boys?

35:48.714 --> 35:50.881
          (rock music)

35:50.883 --> 35:53.416
  - Okay, I'll sleep up here.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.798
       - [Erica] Smegma!

36:08.800 --> 36:10.367
            Smegma!

36:10.369 --> 36:11.368
            Smegma!

36:13.539 --> 36:14.538
             Titty!

36:19.344 --> 36:20.343
             Shit!

36:21.547 --> 36:22.946
        Titty bang bang.

36:24.550 --> 36:27.284
    Shit, titty titty titty.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.285
            Tit tit.

36:29.254 --> 36:30.587
        Pee in my butt!

36:34.226 --> 36:35.358
          Cumdumpster.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.296
          Cock, cock.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.764
       Cuck, cuck, cuck.

36:42.801 --> 36:44.201
         Cuck Trudeau.

36:45.370 --> 36:46.836
       Rape, rape, rape.

36:48.707 --> 36:49.906
       Rape, rape, rape,

36:49.908 --> 36:51.575
       rape, rape, rape,

36:52.544 --> 36:54.844
     rape this bitch, rape!

36:54.846 --> 36:56.513
        - What the fuck?

36:56.515 --> 36:59.783
 Goddamn it, pull the fuck over
           right now!

36:59.785 --> 37:01.484
   - What the hell happened?

37:01.486 --> 37:02.719
  - What's going on here, man?

37:02.721 --> 37:04.805
     - I'm okay you, guys.

37:04.806 --> 37:06.890
 I'm fine, I just need balls in
            my ass!

37:12.364 --> 37:13.797
        - You gotta go.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.865
   Here, take this Cannadips.

37:15.867 --> 37:17.367
      It'll calm you down.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.302
     Now get the fuck out!

37:22.674 --> 37:24.341
   - I'm really sorry, guys.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.643
 I hope you have a great, rape,
             trip!

37:26.645 --> 37:28.245
        Trip, rape trip.

37:31.450 --> 37:32.933
   - What was that all about?

37:32.934 --> 37:34.417
  - [Jesse] What the hell was
             that?

37:34.419 --> 37:35.852
    - My kind of girl, bro.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.854
     - I think I'm in love.

37:38.957 --> 37:43.693
¶ Welcome to the mothertruckin'
            woods ¶

37:43.695 --> 37:45.195
  - Well, we'll be right back.

37:45.196 --> 37:46.696
 Wanna get some food, you want
           anything?

37:46.698 --> 37:49.132
        - No man I good.

37:49.133 --> 37:51.567
   I got this Redcon1 protein
             shake.

37:51.568 --> 37:54.002
    And hurry, we're leaving
 after I make this phone call.

37:55.007 --> 38:00.377
  ¶ Four wheel drive and good
            times ¶

38:00.379 --> 38:03.046
¶ Welcome to the mothertruckin'
            woods ¶

38:03.048 --> 38:05.782
        (phone ringing)

38:05.784 --> 38:06.783
         - [Man] Hello?

38:06.785 --> 38:07.984
    - Hello, is this Cyrus?

38:07.986 --> 38:09.853
- [Cyrus] Yes it is, who's this?

38:09.855 --> 38:11.454
    - Cyrus, this is Darcy.

38:11.456 --> 38:12.989
I was given your number and was
              told

38:12.991 --> 38:15.892
    that you'd be expecting
     a call from me today?

38:15.894 --> 38:19.796
       - [Cyrus] Oh shit,
   Darcy, yeah that's right.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.531
     - So what's the plan?

38:21.533 --> 38:24.000
 - [Cyrus] Well shit, sorry to
           say this,

38:24.001 --> 38:26.468
but the deal needs to be pushed
             back.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.488
         - No problem.

38:28.489 --> 38:30.506
We got other shit we can do out
             here.

38:30.509 --> 38:32.309
Where we meeting and what time?

38:32.311 --> 38:33.777
     - [Cyrus] Okay we will
   be meeting in three days.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.612
      Friday at eight p.m.

38:35.614 --> 38:39.416
  26566 Joseph Avenue in Lilo,
           Kentucky.

38:39.418 --> 38:40.717
         Don't be late.

38:40.719 --> 38:41.918
      - That won't happen.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.853
     We'll see you Friday.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.894
           (grunting)

39:02.474 --> 39:03.873
       The fuck is this?

39:03.875 --> 39:05.041
- [Outlaw] We found him outside.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.043
        He needs a ride.

39:07.045 --> 39:09.346
       - No shit, really?

39:09.348 --> 39:11.548
   - He needs a ride, Darcy.

39:13.085 --> 39:15.485
      - Where you headed?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.621
      - I'm going wherever
    that road might take me.

39:18.623 --> 39:19.934
        - Can you drive?

39:19.935 --> 39:21.246
 - As a matter of fact, yeah I
              can.

39:21.247 --> 39:22.558
  I was the only soldier in my
              unit

39:22.561 --> 39:25.562
 in the global war on terrorism

39:25.563 --> 39:28.564
 to take that deuce and a half
   across some sands of Iraq.

39:28.767 --> 39:30.100
        - You're hired.

39:32.637 --> 39:33.636
            - Okay.

39:34.673 --> 39:38.007
     (upbeat country music)

39:40.912 --> 39:43.780
        (keys clinking)

39:43.782 --> 39:45.515
     - So it's Dave, right?

39:45.517 --> 39:47.484
  What kind of work you into?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.552
  - I do a little bit of this
   and a little bit of that.

39:49.554 --> 39:51.121
  I'm kind of a living legend

39:51.123 --> 39:53.623
 from my time spent back in the
           military.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.624
           - Oh yeah?

39:54.626 --> 39:55.692
          How's that?

39:55.694 --> 39:59.662
 - When I was overseas fighting
  the global war on terrorism

39:59.664 --> 40:01.664
pinned down an entire platoon of
            Taliban

40:01.666 --> 40:03.099
  till took a stray round the
             nads,

40:03.101 --> 40:04.100
  blew one of them clean off.

40:04.102 --> 40:04.968
             - Ooh.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.803
        - I'm good now.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.406
     Platoon mates nickname
   me, Lance Small Armstrong.

40:09.408 --> 40:11.191
          (chuckling)

40:11.192 --> 40:12.975
  Unfortunately kind of cut my
         career short.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.429
      - Well, it's good to
    know you were serving up

40:15.430 --> 40:17.881
   our country with a beating
    on them sons of bitches.

40:17.883 --> 40:19.682
      But uh, I must ask.

40:22.120 --> 40:24.921
Why is your hand in your pants?

40:26.558 --> 40:28.141
        - Oh this thing?

40:28.142 --> 40:29.725
 My therapist she says it's for
              PTSD

40:29.728 --> 40:32.195
  but I just think it's 'cause
   I'm a horny son of a bitch

40:32.197 --> 40:33.563
    but for me I just do it

40:33.564 --> 40:34.930
 because it helps me deal with
           them bombs

40:34.931 --> 40:36.297
  going off all around me you
             know?

40:36.298 --> 40:37.664
  - Well it looks like you got
           some bombs

40:37.669 --> 40:39.736
    going off in your pants.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.438
   Just as long as you don't
      have a rape episode,

40:41.440 --> 40:43.640
you keep it in your pants, we're
             good.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.809
 - You ain't got to worry about
          it, Cletus.

40:45.811 --> 40:47.344
 You don't even know it's here

40:47.345 --> 40:48.878
   and you won't even see it
            coming.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.514
  Kind of like that platoon of
            Taliban.

40:51.516 --> 40:53.183
     They didn't even know
     before I drop lug 556

40:53.185 --> 40:54.918
      on their foreheads.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.454
           (laughing)

40:59.891 --> 41:01.858
- Hey, thanks again for driving,
              man.

41:01.860 --> 41:03.510
     Darcy needs some sleep

41:03.511 --> 41:05.161
     and you are crucial to
   us getting there on time.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.896
     I'm Jessie by the way.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.932
  - I'm Dave, what's going on?

41:08.934 --> 41:10.951
      - You nervous, man?

41:10.952 --> 41:12.969
 Why are your hands so clammy?
           (laughing)

41:12.971 --> 41:14.838
  Anyways, those guys sleeping
          back there,

41:14.840 --> 41:16.739
  that's Darcy, that's Chris.

41:16.741 --> 41:18.708
Again, you are really saving our
             asses

41:18.710 --> 41:20.076
   by driving, man, big time.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.645
        - Yeah, you are.

41:21.646 --> 41:23.213
   We're stopping at a couple
           locations.

41:23.215 --> 41:25.849
     Here's our first one.

41:25.851 --> 41:27.050
 - You sure you don't wanna get
          some sleep?

41:27.052 --> 41:28.952
   Won't you wanna get that?

41:28.953 --> 41:30.853
   - Yeah, sounds good, man.

41:30.856 --> 41:31.855
           Thank you.

41:33.558 --> 41:35.892
           (grunting)

41:44.836 --> 41:46.603
           (sniffing)

41:46.605 --> 41:47.604
           - Oh god.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.707
      (crickets chirping)

41:50.709 --> 41:52.876
- Well shit boys, this trip has
           completely

41:52.878 --> 41:55.678
turned around, don't you think?

41:55.680 --> 41:58.248
   - Damn right, starting to
   feel like a road trip now.

41:58.250 --> 42:00.039
 So what are we doing tomorrow?

42:00.040 --> 42:01.829
    - Think we're heading to
    the rattlesnake museum.

42:01.830 --> 42:03.619
  But first we gotta get some
 spicy ass food in the morning,

42:03.622 --> 42:05.255
   get rid of this hangover.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.790
      - Why does everyday
    got to be about eating?

42:07.792 --> 42:09.042
    I don't care what we do

42:09.043 --> 42:10.293
      as long as you don't
   throw up in the sink again

42:10.295 --> 42:11.895
      like a little bitch.

42:11.897 --> 42:14.030
 - I'm a pro at throwing up in
             sinks.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.165
    But those days are over.

42:18.303 --> 42:19.802
           (coughing)

42:19.804 --> 42:21.237
    - Chris, you all right?

42:21.239 --> 42:22.722
             Good?

42:22.723 --> 42:24.206
     Chris, you all right?

42:24.209 --> 42:26.709
  Dude, I think he's choking.

42:26.711 --> 42:28.044
     - Everybody get back!

42:28.046 --> 42:29.129
          I got this.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.213
  Save many a life in my day.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.749
           (grunting)

42:34.019 --> 42:35.318
     Spit it out, baby boy.

42:35.320 --> 42:36.719
     Spit it out, come on.

42:36.721 --> 42:38.788
             - Oh!

42:38.789 --> 42:40.856
- Ew, Dave, is that your jerkoff
             hand?

42:40.859 --> 42:41.969
            - Maybe.

42:41.970 --> 42:43.080
   - Hey, you're choking on a
        little bit more

42:43.081 --> 42:44.191
      than just chips now.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.161
           (groaning)

42:45.163 --> 42:46.913
          - Oh, yeah.

42:46.914 --> 42:48.664
 - Don't throw up in the sink.

42:48.667 --> 42:51.200
- All right, going back to bed.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.602
       Try not to choke.

42:52.604 --> 42:53.937
 - Yeah, don't worry, we won't.

42:53.939 --> 42:55.638
  Just keep your hand in your
             pants.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.574
        Fucking weirdo.

42:57.576 --> 42:58.792
   - What's up with that guy?

42:58.793 --> 43:00.009
    - Well he's got a little
      problem that he got

43:00.011 --> 43:01.878
    from the war on terror.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.581
- What kind of problem is that?

43:04.583 --> 43:08.284
   - See, Dave's got chronic
         masturbation.

43:08.286 --> 43:09.953
         He can't stop.

43:09.955 --> 43:11.721
 So don't ever touch his right
             hand.

43:11.723 --> 43:13.039
        - What the fuck?

43:13.040 --> 43:14.356
- [Darcy] Not in the sink, dick
            breath!

43:14.359 --> 43:15.342
 - Hey Chris, when you're done

43:15.343 --> 43:16.326
  let's go down to that river!

43:16.328 --> 43:17.711
            - River?

43:17.712 --> 43:19.095
   - Well yeah, we wanted to
    get a little fishing in.

43:19.097 --> 43:20.763
       You guys wanna go?

43:20.765 --> 43:21.864
 - Nah, I'm done for the night.

43:21.866 --> 43:23.866
      - Yeah I'm good too.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.501
     - You guys are dicks.

43:25.502 --> 43:27.135
 Outlaw, grab the poles, let's
              go.

43:27.138 --> 43:28.655
    - Grab them poles, huh?

43:28.656 --> 43:30.173
Sounds like something Dave would
              do.

43:30.175 --> 43:32.709
           (laughing)

43:37.315 --> 43:39.782
  - Oh, dude, this is perfect.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.784
    Bet there's all types of
   fish up in this sumbitch.

43:41.786 --> 43:43.386
    - Yeah, fish'll be cool.

43:43.388 --> 43:45.788
   - Hey, tie that rope off.

43:46.958 --> 43:49.192
  - Oh dude, look what I got.

43:49.194 --> 43:50.827
  Some edibles, you want some?

43:50.829 --> 43:51.928
           - Nah man.

43:51.930 --> 43:53.262
     I got me some of this.

43:53.264 --> 43:54.130
    - [Chris] What is that?

43:54.132 --> 43:55.220
        - It's Cannadip.

43:55.221 --> 43:56.309
  - [Chris] What is it though?

43:56.310 --> 43:57.398
     - It's weed dip, dude.

43:57.402 --> 44:00.136
 It's THC CBD infused dip, bro.

44:01.272 --> 44:04.641
 - [Chris] Hell yeah, let's try
             some.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.143
            Woohoo!

44:06.144 --> 44:07.644
- [Outlaw] Woo, that was a scary
              one!

44:07.645 --> 44:09.145
 Ah, we're gonna catch us some
           fish now.

44:09.147 --> 44:10.747
  Gotta feed Jessie's fat ass.

44:10.749 --> 44:12.682
     - [Chris] Heard that.

44:13.852 --> 44:16.986
Let's try some of that cannabis
              dip.

44:18.023 --> 44:20.289
   Get you some of that, ooh.

44:21.126 --> 44:22.659
        Mmm, it's good.

44:25.730 --> 44:28.665
        (birds chirping)

44:36.174 --> 44:38.525
     - Hey, get up, fatass!

44:38.526 --> 44:40.877
   Don't you know only whores
   make money on their backs?

44:40.879 --> 44:41.878
           - God, ah!

44:43.014 --> 44:44.280
         The fuck, man?

44:45.817 --> 44:49.452
   What's going on here, what
           happened?

44:49.454 --> 44:51.754
I'm trying to sleep here, bitch.

44:51.756 --> 44:53.022
         - Not no more.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.225
       Here, drink this.

44:56.227 --> 44:57.994
       It'll wake you up.

44:57.996 --> 45:00.196
  You don't need none of that
          spicy food.

45:00.198 --> 45:02.198
Get that shit out of your head.

45:02.200 --> 45:04.534
     Diet is psychological.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.869
   Trust me, all you need is
    this Redcon1 Total War.

45:06.871 --> 45:08.805
   You're up and ready to go.

45:08.807 --> 45:10.106
 You know that this shit is all
            you need

45:10.108 --> 45:11.608
      throughout the day--

45:11.609 --> 45:13.109
      - Shut the fuck up!

45:13.111 --> 45:14.944
I don't need to hear any of your
            speeches

45:14.946 --> 45:16.746
        about my health.

45:16.748 --> 45:18.081
        I just woke up.

45:22.921 --> 45:25.254
   - Fucking Chris and Outlaw
          aren't here.

45:25.256 --> 45:26.823
         Where they at?

45:26.825 --> 45:28.074
      - I don't know, man.

45:28.075 --> 45:29.324
Probably still out on their pow
              wow

45:29.327 --> 45:31.360
     fishing or some shit.

45:31.362 --> 45:33.329
        They out front?

45:33.331 --> 45:35.215
      - I don't see them.

45:35.216 --> 45:37.100
     Why do I always gotta
   babysit you motherfuckers?

45:37.102 --> 45:39.836
  - Relax, you know Outlaw is
            fishing.

45:39.838 --> 45:41.237
        They'll be back.

45:49.380 --> 45:51.247
      - Oh, what the fuck?

45:52.951 --> 45:55.284
    - Looks like you missed
      a spot on your face.

45:55.286 --> 45:57.637
     - Think this is funny?

45:57.638 --> 45:59.989
   Wipe your mouth off, dick
            breath.

45:59.991 --> 46:00.990
           - Ah shit!

46:01.793 --> 46:02.792
           - Exactly.

46:03.995 --> 46:05.261
    - Where the hell are we?

46:05.263 --> 46:06.829
    I think we fell asleep.

46:06.830 --> 46:08.396
  - I thought you secured the
             rope.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.399
      - Ah shit, I forgot.

46:10.401 --> 46:11.467
           Now what?

46:11.468 --> 46:12.534
   How are we gonna get back?

46:12.537 --> 46:13.903
    Darcy's gonna be pissed.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.371
      - Yeah, fuck Darcy.

46:15.373 --> 46:17.406
I need to figure this shit out.

46:17.408 --> 46:19.142
   - Can't we just row back?

46:19.144 --> 46:20.476
        - Upstream, no!

46:24.449 --> 46:27.884
   Ah dude, I don't have any
            service.

46:27.886 --> 46:29.852
Just walk up this bank until we
           find them.

46:29.854 --> 46:32.188
           (grunting)

46:41.199 --> 46:42.865
         - Damn, dude.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.467
    It's been like an hour.

46:44.469 --> 46:46.536
  So what, we just keep going?

46:46.538 --> 46:48.521
           - Uh yeah.

46:48.522 --> 46:50.505
     It's kind of our only
     option at this point.

46:50.508 --> 46:52.508
      (creature growling)

46:52.510 --> 46:54.310
   - Oh shit, what was that?

46:54.312 --> 46:57.313
     - I think that was an
    Appalachian Moose Bear.

46:57.315 --> 47:00.183
     - What the hell is an
    Appalachian Moose Bear?

47:00.185 --> 47:03.519
 - I don't know, but it sounded
             good.

47:03.521 --> 47:04.520
             - Ugh.

47:14.065 --> 47:15.031
           Oh, shit.

47:15.033 --> 47:18.034
  - Oh dude, that's boar shit.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.602
   And from the looks of it,

47:19.604 --> 47:21.204
  that's a big mother trucker.

47:21.206 --> 47:22.205
             - Aw.

47:23.374 --> 47:25.474
Fuck asshole, you just leave me?

47:25.476 --> 47:28.377
   (intense orchestral music)
 (boar snorting and squealing)

47:28.379 --> 47:29.378
             - Run!

47:30.248 --> 47:32.481
       Run, it's morning!

47:32.483 --> 47:35.618
  The boars are hungry in the
            morning!

47:44.429 --> 47:45.428
            - Shit!

47:50.301 --> 47:51.167
           (grunting)

47:51.169 --> 47:53.052
           - Ah yeah.

47:53.053 --> 47:54.936
 Ah, this Total War's the shit!

47:55.874 --> 47:58.041
         Ah, big time!

47:58.042 --> 48:00.209
    (light orchestral music)

48:05.083 --> 48:06.983
           (panting)

48:06.985 --> 48:10.386
  - Hey, shut the fuck up, I'm
          meditating.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.221
I don't even wanna hear you guys
             speak.

48:12.223 --> 48:14.257
  How very responsible of you.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.994
   - We just got chased by a
         fucking boar!

48:17.996 --> 48:20.429
   - Is that the story you're
    sticking to, fucksticks?

48:20.431 --> 48:22.490
             - No!

48:22.491 --> 48:24.550
   We fell asleep in the boat
     and floated downriver.

48:24.551 --> 48:26.610
  Then we hiked our asses back
            upstream

48:26.611 --> 48:28.670
  into the woods with nothing
     but our fucking cocks

48:28.673 --> 48:33.209
  in our hands being chased by
   an Appalachian Moose Bear!

48:33.211 --> 48:35.077
     - An Appalachian what?

48:35.079 --> 48:37.046
  You are totally high, dude.

48:37.048 --> 48:39.148
  There's nothing fucking out
             there.

48:39.150 --> 48:40.650
          - Whatever.

48:40.651 --> 48:42.151
      Go see for yourself.

48:42.153 --> 48:43.019
           He'll see.

48:43.021 --> 48:44.687
        (boar growling)

48:44.688 --> 48:46.354
  - Oh shit, fucking boar out
             there!

48:46.357 --> 48:47.356
      - What'd I tell you?

48:47.358 --> 48:48.680
     - [Darcy] We gotta go!

48:48.681 --> 48:50.003
 - We gotta get the hell out of
             here!

48:50.004 --> 48:51.326
 - You're stepping on my chips,
            asshole!

48:51.329 --> 48:52.461
 - Chill the fuck out, Jessie!

48:52.463 --> 48:54.196
(boys shouting over each other)

48:54.198 --> 48:56.299
          (screaming)

48:56.301 --> 48:57.500
         - [Jesse] Go!

49:05.043 --> 49:07.476
       - So, we still got
   another day to kill, boys.

49:07.478 --> 49:09.078
 What you guys feel like doing?

49:09.079 --> 49:10.679
 - Don't you remember anything,
             dummy?

49:10.682 --> 49:12.715
What, can't handle your liquor,
             dude?

49:12.717 --> 49:14.717
    I said last night, while
     I was getting hammered

49:14.719 --> 49:16.485
  that we were gonna get some
         spicy ass food

49:16.487 --> 49:17.687
   and hit up the rattlesnake
            museum.

49:17.689 --> 49:18.554
           (slapping)

49:18.556 --> 49:19.806
              Ow!

49:19.807 --> 49:21.057
     Fuck dude, that hurt!

49:21.059 --> 49:22.625
        - I bet it does.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.192
You had that coming you fucking
             fucko.

49:24.195 --> 49:26.279
         - Yeah he did.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.364
   Anyways, what the hell is
    in a rattlesnake museum?

49:28.366 --> 49:30.099
 - Dead rattlesnakes, dum dum,
           you dummy.

49:30.101 --> 49:31.367
         The fuck, man?

49:32.303 --> 49:33.502
         Jesus Christ.

49:35.273 --> 49:38.107
 Anyways, it's gonna be pretty
             cool.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.408
   A buddy said it's awesome.

49:39.410 --> 49:40.977
     I even seen the pics.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.545
       He says they got a
    world record rattlesnake

49:42.547 --> 49:44.680
    in one of the exhibits.

49:44.682 --> 49:46.682
    - I got the world record
   snake right here, skippy.

49:46.684 --> 49:47.717
 We don't need no damn museum.

49:47.719 --> 49:48.985
           (laughing)

49:48.987 --> 49:50.319
     - Screw it, let's go.

49:50.321 --> 49:51.754
I need some vlog footage anyway.

49:51.756 --> 49:52.739
         - Let's do it?

49:52.740 --> 49:53.723
       - All right then.

49:53.725 --> 49:55.424
   Rattlesnake museum it is.

49:55.426 --> 50:00.563
        (snake rattling)
       (machine beeping)

50:09.040 --> 50:10.439
          - Hey dude.

50:10.441 --> 50:12.375
        Yo Mad, you up?

50:12.377 --> 50:15.077
   - Dude, he got fucked up.

50:15.079 --> 50:17.713
- How the hell does someone get
              bit

50:17.715 --> 50:19.715
     by a dead rattlesnake?

50:21.352 --> 50:22.284
        - Fucking loser.

50:22.286 --> 50:23.986
          (chuckling)

50:23.987 --> 50:25.687
      - Hey I call dibs on
    all of his gaming shit.

50:25.688 --> 50:27.388
    You think he wants this
   sausage I brought for him?

50:27.392 --> 50:29.759
  - Hmm, give me the sausage.

50:29.761 --> 50:31.394
      I'm starving, dude.

50:31.396 --> 50:33.262
  I haven't eaten in four five
             days.

50:33.264 --> 50:34.447
          - Starving?

50:34.448 --> 50:35.631
     You've been here like
     five fucking minutes.

50:35.633 --> 50:37.366
        - What happened?

50:37.368 --> 50:39.201
- Apparently, you walked through
            the door

50:39.203 --> 50:43.305
    and tripped and you fell
     into the damn exhibit.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.808
   Now we're behind schedule
   and this shit ain't funny.

50:45.810 --> 50:48.310
    - Hey, fuck you asshole,
    I almost died right now

50:48.312 --> 50:51.180
   and all you care about is
 getting that stupid dip deal?

50:51.182 --> 50:53.038
           I'm sorry.

50:53.039 --> 50:54.895
But my life is a little bit more
           important

50:54.896 --> 50:56.752
than any amount of tits, money,
            and dip.

50:56.754 --> 50:58.688
I'm sitting in this gurney right
              now

50:58.689 --> 51:00.623
   and all I can think about
     is getting home alive.

51:00.625 --> 51:02.658
That being said, Chris, give me
           my phone.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.360
   I need to get out of here.

51:04.361 --> 51:06.061
- Dude, you just can't leave us
           right now.

51:06.064 --> 51:08.564
  - Yeah, come on dude, just a
          little bite.

51:08.566 --> 51:11.600
     - We're doing this to
  achieve the American dream.

51:11.602 --> 51:14.203
         Come on, man.

51:14.204 --> 51:16.805
     Your fans and everyone
      are gonna love this.

51:17.775 --> 51:19.642
 Sometimes we go through things
           to make us

51:19.644 --> 51:22.344
      a better person and
    learn from our mistakes.

51:22.346 --> 51:24.480
We go through life and at times

51:24.482 --> 51:27.383
  come across major problems.

51:27.385 --> 51:30.786
But in the end we come out more
           polished.

51:30.788 --> 51:34.490
    I mean, in order to get
   gold to a moldable state,

51:34.492 --> 51:37.493
   it must get to an extreme
          temperature.

51:37.495 --> 51:40.329
   This is your moment where
   you get to mold your life

51:40.331 --> 51:44.300
 into something better for your
            future.

51:44.302 --> 51:46.836
 Today is your defining moment.

51:47.705 --> 51:50.273
     Quitting will only end

51:50.274 --> 51:52.842
  what you just nearly killed
         yourself over.

51:52.844 --> 51:56.245
   Now is when you become the
        greater person.

51:56.247 --> 51:59.315
  Besides, if you get up, keep
             going,

52:00.451 --> 52:03.686
  what's the worst that could
            happen?

52:03.688 --> 52:07.690
    - I never really wanted
     to be a nurse, dammit.

52:08.526 --> 52:11.260
 - You know what, you're right,
             dude.

52:11.262 --> 52:13.629
I have quit at some low times in
            my life.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.465
  And I've started some things
  that I just couldn't finish.

52:16.467 --> 52:17.600
 People always say I'm nothing

52:17.602 --> 52:19.802
and I'm just a fat motherfucker.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.638
     And I always think I'm
   the one that's gonna quit.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.273
       But you know what?

52:24.275 --> 52:26.876
  I'm gonna finish this shit.

52:26.878 --> 52:28.410
 We've been this far together,

52:28.412 --> 52:30.713
I'm not gonna quit now or ever.

52:30.715 --> 52:32.314
   Let's stop dicking around.

52:32.316 --> 52:34.150
    Let's get to this deal.

52:34.152 --> 52:37.553
 - You can't really go out like
           that, sir.

52:37.555 --> 52:39.155
   - I'm going on a dip run!

52:39.157 --> 52:42.525
     (upbeat hip hop music)

52:56.207 --> 52:57.740
   - [Chris] Hold on dude, I
   need to piss really quick

52:57.742 --> 53:01.544
      and Dave's in there
    taking a fricking shit.

53:05.449 --> 53:08.584
 - [Jesse] Hey me too, hold on
             Chris!

53:20.431 --> 53:22.198
    Hey, how you doing, man?

53:22.200 --> 53:24.366
     - Oh god, really dude?

53:24.368 --> 53:25.918
 Of all the places you can piss
              at,

53:25.919 --> 53:27.469
 you're gonna piss next to me?

53:27.471 --> 53:29.338
      - Chill, relax, huh?

53:31.375 --> 53:34.243
      Yeah I'm having some
   major gaming withdrawals.

53:34.245 --> 53:35.511
  - [Chris] Tell me about it,
             dude.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.680
 Hey, quit staring at my dick!

53:37.682 --> 53:38.581
   What's your problem, man?

53:38.583 --> 53:40.649
           (laughing)

53:40.651 --> 53:41.750
       Hey what is that?

53:41.752 --> 53:43.486
        - [Jesse] What?

53:43.487 --> 53:45.221
      - I don't know, man.

53:45.222 --> 53:46.956
    - What the hell are you
     doing on my property?

53:46.958 --> 53:48.524
      - [Chris] Looks like
     he's coming over here.

53:48.526 --> 53:49.858
- [Jesse] Hey, fuck off, this is
            America!

53:49.860 --> 53:51.694
  I can piss anywhere I want.

53:51.696 --> 53:53.562
- Kind of looks like an inbred.

53:53.564 --> 53:54.863
  You think he likes sausage?

53:54.865 --> 53:55.998
      - I don't know, man.

53:56.000 --> 53:57.617
    But he's getting closer.

53:57.618 --> 53:59.235
    - [Chris] Oh shit dude,
   he has a fricking shovel.

53:59.237 --> 53:59.902
       - [Jesse] Oh shit!

53:59.904 --> 54:00.869
             Go go!

54:00.871 --> 54:02.972
         (tense music)

54:02.974 --> 54:04.907
  - You know what, I bet you,
         let's do this.

54:04.909 --> 54:07.193
 I bet you I can pack four cans

54:07.194 --> 54:09.478
 quicker than you can pack one,
            skippy.

54:09.480 --> 54:12.181
 - You fucking kidding me right
              now?

54:12.182 --> 54:14.883
     - Nope, put your money
  where your mouth is, pussy.

54:14.885 --> 54:16.485
      I'm the king of dip.

54:16.487 --> 54:17.753
   - Well I'm the god of dip.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.238
   - I'm the superman of dip!

54:19.239 --> 54:20.722
  - Well where's your fricking
          cape, then?

54:20.725 --> 54:22.858
      - I'm the souza dip!

54:22.860 --> 54:24.627
  No wait, I'm the dip doctor.

54:24.629 --> 54:25.861
    - Oh does the dip doctor
     prescribe that sitdoll

54:25.863 --> 54:27.429
    on your freaking biceps?

54:27.431 --> 54:28.564
How about this, how about this?

54:28.566 --> 54:29.615
    Grab this fricking can.

54:29.616 --> 54:30.665
All right listen, we're gonna go

54:30.668 --> 54:32.801
     on the count of seven.

54:32.803 --> 54:33.936
            - Okay.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.771
       - One, two, seven!

54:35.773 --> 54:37.640
      - Oh you cocksucker.

54:38.876 --> 54:40.576
    - Oh, that's good, yeah.

54:40.578 --> 54:41.577
              Mmm.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.513
      God, it's so juicy.

54:44.515 --> 54:45.881
        - Juicy as fuck!

54:49.020 --> 54:51.420
     - Help us you fucking
    dicks, open up the door!

54:51.422 --> 54:52.538
       - [Darcy] Oh shit!

54:52.539 --> 54:53.655
   - Oh shit, open the door!

54:53.658 --> 54:54.923
         Open the door!

54:55.760 --> 54:57.426
   - [Jesse] Darcy, let's go!

54:57.428 --> 54:58.961
  What the hell are we waiting
              for?

54:58.963 --> 55:00.562
  We gotta get the hell out of
             here!

55:00.564 --> 55:01.864
            Go, go!

55:01.866 --> 55:02.765
      - [Chris] Let's go!

55:02.767 --> 55:04.033
         - [Outlaw] Go!

55:10.541 --> 55:11.907
     - Oh shit yo, hold up!

55:11.909 --> 55:13.676
          - What the?

55:13.678 --> 55:15.010
        Hit the brakes!

55:15.012 --> 55:16.679
       (tires screeching)

55:16.681 --> 55:19.481
         (horn honking)

55:22.520 --> 55:23.919
         What the hell?

55:23.921 --> 55:24.987
        - [Darcy] Shit!

55:24.989 --> 55:26.789
      - Oh, what happened?

55:26.791 --> 55:28.590
      What the hell, Dave?

55:28.592 --> 55:30.392
       - Freaking psycho.

55:30.394 --> 55:31.644
     - Everybody all right?

55:31.645 --> 55:32.895
 - Man, there was a car coming
          right at me.

55:32.897 --> 55:34.496
   What was I supposed to do?

55:34.498 --> 55:35.748
   - The fuck were you doing

55:35.749 --> 55:36.999
 where you just barely seen the
              car?

55:37.001 --> 55:39.001
     Straight fucking road!

55:40.771 --> 55:42.705
 I'm gonna go out and check the
            damage.

55:42.707 --> 55:44.973
   I know something's broken.

55:47.878 --> 55:49.845
          - You good?

55:49.846 --> 55:51.813
   - Dude what the hell, it's
          crazy, man.

55:51.816 --> 55:54.817
 - I gotta go uh, clean myself
              off.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.888
     - Really Dave, really?

55:59.889 --> 56:01.989
 - [Dave] I gotta wash up real
             quick.

56:06.030 --> 56:08.130
    - What the hell is that?

56:08.899 --> 56:11.633
    - The hell is that shit?

56:11.635 --> 56:14.503
             - Oh!
           (laughing)

56:14.505 --> 56:16.505
           The fuck!

56:16.506 --> 56:18.506
- Oh, damn, get it off me, man.

56:18.509 --> 56:20.776
- Oh my god, look at it, it's so
             slimy.

56:20.778 --> 56:22.711
 - Oh I'm so glad I didn't sit
          there, dude.

56:22.713 --> 56:23.712
           Oh my god.

56:24.548 --> 56:25.547
              Oh.

56:26.584 --> 56:28.084
        He blew a load.

56:28.085 --> 56:29.585
      - Oh what up, Darc?

56:29.587 --> 56:30.586
           - Asshole.

56:30.588 --> 56:33.055
Well, we got a flat tire, boys.

56:33.057 --> 56:34.523
          - Flat tire?

56:34.525 --> 56:36.525
 The tits are we gonna do now?

56:36.527 --> 56:38.994
 - We got a spare, but no tire
             iron.

56:38.996 --> 56:40.529
           (groaning)

56:40.531 --> 56:41.764
I don't have any phone service.

56:41.766 --> 56:43.966
   You guys got any service?

56:44.869 --> 56:46.452
             - No.

56:46.453 --> 56:48.036
 - I saw a light up the hill a
          little ways.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.037
      Looked like a farm.

56:49.039 --> 56:50.589
      - I'll go with you.

56:50.590 --> 56:52.140
Hey you guys stay here and watch
           our shit.

56:52.143 --> 56:53.976
  And try to flag down a car.

56:53.978 --> 56:55.144
      We'll be right back.

56:55.146 --> 56:56.612
  What time you think, Darcy?

56:56.614 --> 56:57.679
          - Not long.

56:59.617 --> 57:00.749
          - Good luck.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.021
             - So.

57:06.891 --> 57:08.824
      Wanna play Go Fish?

57:08.826 --> 57:10.659
         - Really dude?

57:10.661 --> 57:13.329
  Out of all things we can do

57:13.330 --> 57:15.998
   at this moment of tragedy,
    you wanna play Go Fish?

57:16.834 --> 57:18.100
          Let's do it.

57:18.102 --> 57:20.903
         (wolf howling)

57:24.508 --> 57:27.009
      - Fuck man, I never
  realize how loud nature is.

57:27.011 --> 57:28.527
You're used to this shit, aren't
              you?

57:28.528 --> 57:30.044
      - Yeah man, you get
    used to shit real quick

57:30.047 --> 57:31.547
  when you're out here in the
           backwoods.

57:31.549 --> 57:32.781
         (crow cawing)

57:32.783 --> 57:33.982
         What was that?

57:33.984 --> 57:34.983
            - What?

57:36.053 --> 57:37.920
 - No, it's probably other men.

57:37.922 --> 57:40.522
It's just the locals doing what
            they do.

57:40.524 --> 57:42.191
   - What do you mean locals
      doing what they do?

57:42.193 --> 57:43.642
   - Well if I'm not mistaken

57:43.643 --> 57:45.092
  we're out here in the Ozarks
             right?

57:45.095 --> 57:47.162
Been down here hunting a couple
             times.

57:47.164 --> 57:49.631
    They told me some crazy
   stories about what goes on

57:49.633 --> 57:51.250
        in these parts.

57:51.251 --> 57:52.868
     But you probably don't
   wanna hear that right now.

57:52.870 --> 57:54.770
   - Dude, I ain't no pussy.

57:54.772 --> 57:57.973
    - Well see this used to
     be an old mining town.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.631
  These city slickers came in

57:59.632 --> 58:01.288
   and they bought up all the
             mines.

58:01.289 --> 58:02.945
    The miners wanted to get
  revenge on the city slickers

58:02.947 --> 58:05.214
   so what they did was they
   tied them up by their feet

58:05.216 --> 58:08.750
    to a gosh dang tree and
 burned them over a giant fire!

58:08.752 --> 58:11.587
 And they still haven't caught
    the miners to this day.

58:11.589 --> 58:14.523
     People come here every
   year camping and fishing,

58:14.525 --> 58:18.193
   trying to find the remains
  for some gosh dang answers.

58:18.195 --> 58:21.864
Well, it's weird hillbilly shit,
             dude.

58:21.866 --> 58:23.665
 - Bro, you're bullshitting me.

58:23.667 --> 58:25.551
         - No I swear.

58:25.552 --> 58:27.436
 I'll show you the FBI article
           right now

58:27.437 --> 58:29.321
but we ain't got no service out
             here.

58:29.322 --> 58:31.206
 I'll show you when we get back
           to the RV.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.074
      Dude, what is that?

58:32.076 --> 58:33.442
        - Where, where?

58:33.443 --> 58:34.809
   - I think that's a house.

58:34.812 --> 58:36.044
      - It is that house.

58:36.046 --> 58:38.046
  See that walk wasn't so bad.

58:38.048 --> 58:41.650
 They better have something we
           could use.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.623
    - [Jesse] Two of hearts.

58:47.625 --> 58:48.924
       - Go fish, bitch!

58:48.925 --> 58:50.224
       - Fuck, goddamit!

58:50.227 --> 58:51.260
       - [Chris] Sucker.

58:51.262 --> 58:52.594
      - I'ma grab a beer.

58:52.596 --> 58:54.129
       - Grab me one too.

58:59.970 --> 59:01.970
  Dude, I think they're back.

59:01.972 --> 59:03.839
       - [Jesse] No way.

59:03.841 --> 59:05.191
      Oh shit it is them.

59:05.192 --> 59:06.542
    - Dude, we should scare
     the shit out of them.

59:06.544 --> 59:07.766
      - Dude I'm so down.

59:07.767 --> 59:08.989
We can hide in those bushes out
             there

59:08.990 --> 59:10.212
 and scare the shit out of them
            so bad.

59:10.214 --> 59:12.014
      - Yes, let's do it.

59:14.718 --> 59:17.252
         (eerie music)

59:29.166 --> 59:31.700
           (knocking)

59:34.972 --> 59:36.972
 - Well praise the Lord above.

59:36.974 --> 59:40.008
   He's blessed us with some
           visitors.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.677
             Danny!

59:41.679 --> 59:45.147
   Danny, Dan, we've got some
         visitors here.

59:47.017 --> 59:48.750
    - Well hey there, guys.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.953
     What's got you two out
    here deep in the woods?

59:50.955 --> 59:53.055
Look like you ain't from around
             here.

59:53.057 --> 59:55.074
    What can we do you for?

59:55.075 --> 59:57.092
 - Uh, our RV broke down up the
             road.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.193
We were kind of hoping that you
              guys

59:58.195 --> 59:59.861
  might be able to help with--

59:59.863 --> 01:00:01.964
  - You know what, enough chit
             chat.

01:00:01.966 --> 01:00:03.899
 Colder than a donkey's bottom
           out there.

01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:06.201
 Come in, have a meal, and then
          we can talk

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.170
   about your broke down RV.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.939
 - Well you see we kind of have
   to be somewhere right now.

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:12.374
    - We'd love to sit down.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:14.159
    Dude, shut the fuck up.

01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:15.943
  Just go in there, eat their
             shit,

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:17.779
   get the fuck out of here.

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:19.648
      Remember the Ozarks.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:24.353
        - [Woman] Here.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:29.257
         (eerie music)

01:00:38.836 --> 01:00:40.202
  - [Danny] Let's have a word
  of prayer to the great lord

01:00:40.204 --> 01:00:42.554
    for this bountiful food.

01:00:42.555 --> 01:00:44.905
 - Dude, they're going to take
   your kidneys and my liver.

01:00:44.908 --> 01:00:47.042
   And we're about to eat the
    last visitors they had.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:48.043
            - M-hmm.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.247
  - We also thank you for our
            visitors

01:00:52.249 --> 01:00:54.883
 as you know damn well we don't
  get a lot of them out here.

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:55.751
             Amen.

01:00:55.753 --> 01:00:57.152
            - Amen.

01:00:57.154 --> 01:00:58.286
           - Oh shit.

01:00:58.288 --> 01:00:59.287
             Amen.

01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:02.257
 - So what brings you two boys
            out here

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:04.726
   on a cold night like this?

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:09.064
    You all must be working
   on the oil rigs out there.

01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:12.134
  Mighty fine work they do out
             there.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.804
 - Well actually, we were just,

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:19.107
  we're driving our RV back to
              camp

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:21.043
    so we can get back home.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:25.447
     Yeah, it's been a long
  work week, that's for sure.

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:27.315
      - [Woman] Oh, Bobby!

01:01:28.819 --> 01:01:30.852
      - Hey Paw, hey Maw.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.054
           - Oh son.

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.455
- I see we got us some visitors.

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:34.890
        - [Woman] Yeah.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.958
 - How you boys doing tonight?

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.093
          - Ah yellow.

01:01:39.329 --> 01:01:40.328
             - Hi.

01:01:41.231 --> 01:01:43.120
         - Hey, Bobby.

01:01:43.121 --> 01:01:45.010
   These boys here are having
     some vehicle problems

01:01:45.011 --> 01:01:46.900
     so invited them in for
   dinner till you got home.

01:01:46.904 --> 01:01:48.136
     What do you boys need?

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.038
  Bobby here can fix anything.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.240
   - Well we got a flat tire.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:54.209
    Don't have a tire iron.

01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:55.877
  We do have a spare, though.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.013
      - I got a tire iron
    right here in the back.

01:01:58.015 --> 01:02:00.849
  I'll grab it, take you boys
             back,

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:03.151
   and I'ma help you fix it.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:04.686
           (laughing)

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.220
    - We gotta get the fuck
     out of here, like now!

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.222
           - I know.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:16.865
    - Dude, this is gonna be
           hilarious.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:18.233
  I can't wait to see Darcy's
             face.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.068
           - I know.

01:02:20.069 --> 01:02:21.902
We'll get those idiots so good.

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.948
     (eerie ambient music)

01:02:32.950 --> 01:02:35.350
     - Dude, I don't think
    that's Outlaw and Darcy.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.052
            - What?

01:02:37.054 --> 01:02:38.053
             Shit.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:45.060
Holy shit, are you seeing this?

01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:53.335
- No way, that's a fucking dude,
             dude.

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.103
 - We gotta get the fuck out of
             here.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:56.605
           (chanting)

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:58.106
- Let's get back to the RV, get
              Dave

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.508
  and then wait for the guys.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:00.909
  This is none of our fricking
           business.

01:03:00.911 --> 01:03:02.561
  I don't wanna die out here.

01:03:02.562 --> 01:03:04.212
    I still haven't gotten a
  soul of chicken dinner yet.

01:03:04.214 --> 01:03:05.380
  And there's no revising this
             shit.

01:03:05.382 --> 01:03:06.481
           (chanting)

01:03:06.483 --> 01:03:08.450
      - Hey, I agree 100%.

01:03:08.452 --> 01:03:10.285
     - [Both] We gotta go.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.386
        (phone chiming)

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.486
- [Man] Different quadrant nine,

01:03:12.489 --> 01:03:13.822
     this is your reminder.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:15.457
      Your pizza's ready.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.225
      Your pizza's ready.

01:03:28.806 --> 01:03:30.356
           (scraping)

01:03:30.357 --> 01:03:31.907
    - [Bobby] Just stick to
   this iron back here, boys,

01:03:31.909 --> 01:03:33.208
       it's a little big.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.610
           (banging)

01:03:34.611 --> 01:03:36.011
     - Sharpening that ax.

01:03:37.447 --> 01:03:39.481
           (grinding)

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.348
           (booming)

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:42.167
         - [Woman] Ooh.

01:03:42.168 --> 01:03:43.985
    - [Outlaw] Ah shit, fuck
   this, what the fuck Darcy?

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.453
      (plates shattering)

01:03:45.455 --> 01:03:48.390
           (bashing)

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:50.859
           (panting)

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:58.466
        - [Darcy] Dude.

01:03:59.937 --> 01:04:01.870
- [Outlaw] Oh dude, is it over?

01:04:01.872 --> 01:04:03.488
          Is it over?

01:04:03.489 --> 01:04:05.105
- We need to get the fuck out of
             here.

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.107
            Come on.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.277
        - What the fuck?

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:22.991
           - Oh, oh.

01:04:25.262 --> 01:04:27.996
 I'ma kill these motherfuckers.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:34.469
       You boys can run!

01:04:34.471 --> 01:04:36.271
      But you can't hide!

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:54.289
  - Wake the fuck up, Dave, we
           gotta go!

01:04:54.291 --> 01:04:55.357
          - The fuck?

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.599
       Is this dip spit?

01:05:04.601 --> 01:05:06.201
 Did you fucking throw dip spit
             on me?

01:05:06.203 --> 01:05:07.369
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:08.370
            - Fuck!

01:05:09.306 --> 01:05:11.239
      What the hell, Dave?

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:13.325
  We gotta get the fuck out of
             here,

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:15.410
 there's inbreds trying to kill
              us!

01:05:18.982 --> 01:05:20.140
          - The fuck?

01:05:20.141 --> 01:05:21.299
     The guys are in there.

01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.458
- [Outlaw] What are we gonna do
              now?

01:05:22.459 --> 01:05:23.617
 - We're gonna run up in there,

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.421
we're gonna save those pussies.

01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.466
  - Holy shit, it's you guys.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.235
- The hell's going on out there,
              man?

01:05:40.237 --> 01:05:41.837
We thought you were coming back,

01:05:41.838 --> 01:05:43.438
we went out there to scare you.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:45.039
    Next thing you know, we
    got cults on our asses.

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:47.042
     - They killed someone
     right in front of us.

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.577
           (knocking)
            - Whoa!

01:05:49.579 --> 01:05:51.346
         - Come on now.

01:05:51.348 --> 01:05:53.214
I don't know that kind of rabid
           ass ideas

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:54.833
       entered your mind,

01:05:54.834 --> 01:05:56.451
     but why don't you boys
   step on out of the vehicle

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.286
        so we can talk?

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.688
    - [Jesse] Fuck you man,
     you're gonna kill us.

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:01.356
      We ain't doing shit.

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:04.159
       - Now why on earth
    would we wanna kill you?

01:06:04.161 --> 01:06:05.660
 - [Darcy] The Ozarks, asshole.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:07.112
    - [Jesse] Yeah we know.

01:06:07.113 --> 01:06:08.563
     We saw what you did to
    that dude in the woods,

01:06:08.565 --> 01:06:09.631
          tied him up.

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:10.698
 That little demon kid slit his
            throat.

01:06:10.701 --> 01:06:13.201
           (laughing)

01:06:13.203 --> 01:06:15.237
     - Well I'll be damned.

01:06:15.238 --> 01:06:17.272
  You all are a bunch of funny
            fellers.

01:06:17.274 --> 01:06:19.240
  That dude you saw strung up?

01:06:19.242 --> 01:06:22.177
 That was a boar from tonight's
             hunt.

01:06:22.179 --> 01:06:25.981
  And that damn demon kid was
    my youngest boy Rutabar.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:29.451
   It was his first kill and
  we have a first kill ritual.

01:06:29.453 --> 01:06:32.487
He got to drink the blood of the
             boar.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:33.989
     As far as the Ozarks,

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:35.690
           (laughing)

01:06:35.692 --> 01:06:37.192
 ain't your parents ever taught
              you

01:06:37.194 --> 01:06:40.095
not to believe in ghost stories?

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.564
 All this commotion over that?

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.167
 Come on now, we see you got a
             flat.

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:48.103
    We got a tire iron here.

01:06:48.105 --> 01:06:50.138
    Why don't you boys step
     on out of the vehicle,

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.606
 throw back some drinks with us

01:06:51.608 --> 01:06:53.274
and we'll get this beater fixed
               up

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:55.477
   and send you on your way.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:08.790
          - Thank god.

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:11.126
  Good thing for you fuckers.

01:07:11.127 --> 01:07:13.461
    'Cause I was about to go
     apeshit on your asses.

01:07:13.463 --> 01:07:16.131
 - I thought we were done for.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:22.370
     - I don't give a rat's
     ass about any of this.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:23.371
           I'm done!

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:27.108
    Dip spit in the face is
     where I draw the line.

01:07:27.110 --> 01:07:29.244
 So adios, and have fun on your
             random

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:32.213
  road trip of clusterfuckery!

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.948
- [Man] What the hell crawled up
            his ass?

01:07:33.949 --> 01:07:35.682
     We're about to have a
         get-together!

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:37.902
     Come on now, drink up.

01:07:37.903 --> 01:07:40.120
  The beer's getting warm but
 the moonshine's getting cold.

01:07:40.123 --> 01:07:41.489
        Am I right boys?

01:07:41.491 --> 01:07:42.490
            Woohoo!

   Can we do this every year?

01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:53.535
        - Sure, Skippy.

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:55.136

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:01.810
    But I can honestly say,

01:08:01.812 --> 01:08:03.611
  it's a little bit worth it.

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:05.480
Hell I can't wait to get back on
           the road.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:08.516
    - Hey, little less deal
  talk, little more drinking.

01:08:08.518 --> 01:08:10.385
      We need a night off.

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:14.523

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:46.321
       - Hey, watch this.

01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:49.256
  Who the fuck thinks they can
          outdrink me?

01:08:49.259 --> 01:08:50.859
      I'm a drinking god!

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.462
            Nobody?

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.131
  That's what I thought, huh.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.633
  - [Darcy] I guess the Ozarks
          ain't shit.

01:08:58.635 --> 01:08:59.634
            - Nope.

01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:04.439
  - All right boys, looks like
  we got ourselves a drinker!

01:09:04.441 --> 01:09:07.375
    These pussy ass bitches
  think they can outdrink us?

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:09.310
     BeersCo, get in here.

01:09:10.913 --> 01:09:13.448
     - You really think you
    can outdrink the south,

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.483
   you sloppy soy boy fatass?

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.002
           (laughing)

01:09:17.002 --> 01:09:18.520
   - [Darcy] All right, let's
     get this thing going,

01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:19.520
        you guys ready?

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:20.622
           All right!

01:09:20.624 --> 01:09:22.423
         When I say go.

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:23.424
            And go!

01:09:24.528 --> 01:09:25.527
    - [Chris] Come on Jesse!

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:26.394
       Come on, come on!

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:27.428
           - Chug it!

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:28.462
         Chug it, dude!

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:29.330
           (spitting)

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.465
          - [All] Aww!

01:09:33.703 --> 01:09:35.687
   - Yellow, what's cracking,
      mother truckers hey!

01:09:35.688 --> 01:09:37.671
    We are here in the south
      partying with these

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.457
     crazy Southern folks.

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:41.241
They are crazy much, I tell you
             what.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.777
I'll check back with you guys in
             a bit.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.279
          I gotta go.

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:45.813
  Yes, I do have a girlfriend.

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:49.484
 And no, I don't go both ways,
             okay?

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:50.897
           Hey Darcy.

01:09:50.898 --> 01:09:52.309
    When do you think we're
     gonna get outta here?

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.720
        (gunshot firing)

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:56.591
         (tense music)

01:09:56.593 --> 01:09:58.760
  - We got ourselves a problem
          here, boys.

01:09:58.762 --> 01:10:00.595
- [Outlaw] Oh that does not look
             good.

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:03.464
   Chris, let's go, let's go.

01:10:03.466 --> 01:10:05.800
    - It seems as if we got
   some snakes in our grass.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:08.336
 There are some outsiders down
             here.

01:10:08.338 --> 01:10:09.671
They're not here on good terms.

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:11.339
 They done knocked out Ma, Pa,

01:10:11.341 --> 01:10:13.325
 they're up there hunched over

01:10:13.326 --> 01:10:15.310
    with welts on their face
  bigger than a Georgia Peach.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:16.311
            - Jesse!

01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.546
          - Holy shit!

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:19.813
       - Hey, that's that
   mothertrucker right there!

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:21.683
         - Run, fatass!

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.551
   (ominous orchestral music)

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.287
         (RV starting)

01:10:27.257 --> 01:10:28.840
       - Fuck you, bitch!

01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:30.424
     - [Man] I'm gonna kill
      you sons of bitches!

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:32.994
   Stop the RV, come back and
        fight, sissies!

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:36.531
     (upbeat country music)

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:41.536
     - So, this is it, huh?

01:10:41.538 --> 01:10:43.538
     We made it, holy shit.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:45.873
  - Yeah, let's hope so, man.

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.775
 It's been a long time coming.

01:10:47.777 --> 01:10:49.877
It's like this is our big break.

01:10:49.879 --> 01:10:51.412
  Been struggling for so long

01:10:51.413 --> 01:10:52.946
 to get MudJug off the ground,
             Chris.

01:10:52.949 --> 01:10:55.683
 Things are finally starting to
            pay off.

01:10:55.685 --> 01:10:56.801
       - I hear you, man.

01:10:56.802 --> 01:10:57.918
 Feels good knowing that we're
           that close

01:10:57.921 --> 01:11:00.238
        to our big win.

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.556
 Too bad we couldn't have found
 a better group of douchebags.

01:11:02.559 --> 01:11:04.743
- I wouldn't have wanted to done
           this deal

01:11:04.744 --> 01:11:06.928
   with any other douchebags
  in the entire world, buddy.

01:11:06.930 --> 01:11:08.630
 - We're some badass ones too.

01:11:08.632 --> 01:11:10.565
I mean we got chased by rednecks

01:11:10.567 --> 01:11:12.533
      not once, but twice.

01:11:12.535 --> 01:11:14.435
  We broke into a mob hideout.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.571
   Nearly raped by trannies,

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:20.575
     and you, knocking out
    that family of inbreds.

01:11:20.577 --> 01:11:22.010
    - I had no choice, dude,

01:11:22.012 --> 01:11:23.945
 considering the circumstances.

01:11:23.947 --> 01:11:26.481
  Damn, we are some badasses.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.483
         - Yes, we are.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.686
   - Hey, sleeping beauties.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:34.722
 We're pulling over to get some
             grub.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:37.592
And I need to make a phone call.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:46.901
  - [Cyrus] Yeah, it's Cyrus.

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:48.620
    - Yo Cyrus, it's Darcy.

01:11:48.621 --> 01:11:50.338
  Hey man, we're about an hour
              out.

01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:51.572
 Just wanna make sure we're on

01:11:51.574 --> 01:11:53.691
   for tonight at eight p.m.

01:11:53.692 --> 01:11:55.809
   - [Cyrus] When I say eight
    p.m., I mean eight p.m.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.512
     No later, no earlier.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:59.347
  I've been looking forward to
            meeting

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:01.349
      Mr. Compton himself.

01:12:01.351 --> 01:12:03.134
   - Should be a good night.

01:12:03.135 --> 01:12:04.918
   I'm pretty juiced to meet
  up and get this thing going.

01:12:04.921 --> 01:12:06.621
 - [Cyrus] Well see you on the
           dip side.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.489
      - Roger, you got it.

01:12:12.762 --> 01:12:16.831
    - Dude, get the fuck in
    here, the money's gone!

01:12:19.469 --> 01:12:22.103
 - The fuck you talking about,
            asshole?

01:12:22.105 --> 01:12:23.971
  The hell's going on in here,
              man?

01:12:23.973 --> 01:12:25.490
        - I don't know.

01:12:25.491 --> 01:12:27.008
We were getting ready, came back
            in here

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.577
to grab my Mudjug and the money
           was gone.

01:12:29.579 --> 01:12:31.045
 We searched the RV everywhere.

01:12:31.047 --> 01:12:32.347
           It's gone!

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.648
  - Betcha it was one of them
           rednecks.

01:12:33.650 --> 01:12:35.316
            - Fuck!

01:12:35.317 --> 01:12:36.983
 Every fucking time, so close!

01:12:36.986 --> 01:12:38.619
       This is bullshit!

01:12:38.621 --> 01:12:39.954
- Chill, we should all just calm
             down.

01:12:39.956 --> 01:12:42.023
  Let's get our shit together
             here.

01:12:42.025 --> 01:12:43.024
        - I heard that.

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:44.859
    I need to eat something.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:48.863
 (light acoustic guitar music)

01:12:49.766 --> 01:12:51.666
           (sighing)

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:52.967
     - So what's the plan?

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:54.936
 We're still doing this, right?

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.838
      - We don't have any
    fricking money, Outlaw.

01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.106
Unless you wanna empty your bank
            account,

01:12:58.108 --> 01:12:59.841
       we're all screwed.

01:13:01.644 --> 01:13:03.945
     - Come on guys, let's
  figure out our options here.

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:06.814
We came too far, too damn close.

01:13:08.118 --> 01:13:10.618
    Hey Darcy, what are you
         thinking, man?

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:11.986
        Yo Darce, Darcy?

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.056
             Darce?

01:13:15.058 --> 01:13:16.691
 - [Darcy] I got nothing, boys.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.493
      I think we're done.

01:13:22.966 --> 01:13:24.749
        - Well, I'm out.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.533
  I'll pull my cards and leave
          while I can.

01:13:26.536 --> 01:13:29.103
Sorry Darcy, I just can't do it
            anymore.

01:13:29.105 --> 01:13:32.040
  If anybody wants to go home,

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.976
  I'm about to get up the bus
    and wallow in my sorrow.

01:13:41.885 --> 01:13:44.552
 - Well, sorry boys, we tried.

01:13:48.691 --> 01:13:51.092
       We really did try.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.494
    - [Darcy] Probably gonna
  leave now too, I guess, huh?

01:13:53.496 --> 01:13:56.798
- You know, you taught me a lot,
              man.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.066
 You helped me when I was down.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.903
You were there for me when shit
           was rough.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:04.906
 You've taught me self control.

01:14:04.908 --> 01:14:07.608
     But the most important
     thing you've taught me

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.978
   is when to pull your cards
   and take what you've got.

01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.681
     I think it's time for
    me to take what I've got

01:14:13.683 --> 01:14:15.950
      and go with it, man.

01:14:15.952 --> 01:14:17.885
      I'm sorry, brother.

01:14:17.887 --> 01:14:19.754
      But I wanna go home.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:22.757
  - I'll meet up with you guys
             later.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:25.560
Let me unload this RV somewhere
             first.

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.895
    Fuck it, man, that thing
      was our kryptonite.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:29.397
 We should have never partied,

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:30.898
 we should have just focused on
           the deal.

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.767
      And that's my fault.

01:14:34.504 --> 01:14:37.905
        (phone ringing)

01:14:37.907 --> 01:14:38.906
             Hello.

01:14:38.908 --> 01:14:41.025
- [Man] Your journey's not over
              yet,

01:14:41.026 --> 01:14:43.143
 you got one more hand to play.

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.912
   Hard times, huh, oh well,

01:14:44.914 --> 01:14:46.948
     I just happen to know
     where your money is at

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.500
  and how you can get it back.

01:14:48.501 --> 01:14:50.051
 And again, I'm gonna text you
          the address.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:51.786
 Follow this to get your money.

01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:53.654
      And you're welcome.

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:56.157
 - Wait, who the fuck is this?

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:57.024
     - [Chris] Who's that?

01:14:57.026 --> 01:14:57.892
            - Hello?

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:58.776
         - Who is that?

01:14:58.777 --> 01:14:59.659
      Is everything cool?

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:00.595
        (phone chiming)

01:15:00.597 --> 01:15:02.129
          - Shit, man.

01:15:02.131 --> 01:15:03.898
You know how the universe works,

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.666
everything happens for a reason?

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:06.767
- The hell you're talking about,
              man?

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:08.069
     You're sounding crazy.

01:15:08.071 --> 01:15:10.571
      Let's go home, dude.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.230
          We're done.

01:15:13.231 --> 01:15:15.888
   - Well we just got another
             break.

01:15:15.889 --> 01:15:18.546
  The guy on the phone told me
  that our money's still here.

01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:22.250
           (knocking)

01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:26.888
           (laughing)
            - Great.

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:28.434
     - [Outlaw] What's up?

01:15:28.435 --> 01:15:29.979
We're about to hoover to the bus
            station.

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:31.524
       - Well, I just got
   another random phone call,

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:32.894
saying if we want our money back

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:35.263
     to go to this address.

01:15:35.265 --> 01:15:38.799
     (upbeat country music)

01:15:40.803 --> 01:15:42.670
      - Man, do you really
   think our money is there?

01:15:42.672 --> 01:15:44.772
    We already lost it once.

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.873
 What the hell are the odds of
  getting our shit back again?

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.876
 - Yeah it sounds like a total
          setup, dude.

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:50.912
      - Hey, it's the only
   card we got left to play.

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:53.014
      Besides, what's the
    worst that could happen?

01:15:53.016 --> 01:15:55.816
   It's not like your ass got
  a hot date waiting for you.

01:15:55.818 --> 01:15:58.286
 - Hey, pitch a right up here.

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:00.888
      I think this is it.

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:20.107
        (flies buzzing)

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:28.583
   - The hell is this place?

01:16:29.185 --> 01:16:31.252
    - Is this a sex dungeon?

01:16:31.254 --> 01:16:33.187
      - It does smell like
    leather and latex, huh?

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:36.057
  - [Darcy] Hey, stop fucking
around and find a light switch.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:38.960
      - [Jesse] Hold on, I
     think I got something.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.996
           (thudding)
             - Aw.

01:16:41.998 --> 01:16:44.732
  What the hell, is that Dave?

01:16:44.734 --> 01:16:47.235
      - Guys, is that you?

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.737
   Guys please, you gotta let
    me out of here, please.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:50.605
       - Fuck you, Dave!

01:16:50.607 --> 01:16:52.173
           (grunting)

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:53.740
    - What the hell are you
     doing with our money?

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:55.043
       - Ah, your money?

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:56.344
You can have your money, please.

01:16:56.346 --> 01:16:57.845
The guy who tied me up is crazy.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:16:59.347
      He's gonna kill me!

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:01.549
 - Why the fuck would you take
           our money?

01:17:01.550 --> 01:17:03.750
    You're supposed to be a
   veteran, an American hero!

01:17:03.753 --> 01:17:05.236
        We trusted you!

01:17:05.237 --> 01:17:06.720
- No man, I'm sorry, no I'm not
           a veteran.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:08.990
I didn't even make it past ROTC!

01:17:08.992 --> 01:17:11.759
   I couldn't stop beating my
    tallywhacker, I'm sorry.

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:13.728
 - Stolen valor, motherfucker!

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:15.396
           (grunting)

01:17:15.398 --> 01:17:17.398
- You know what, leave him tied
               up

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.233
    to be eaten by the dogs.

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:21.235
   You're a lucky man, Dave.

01:17:21.237 --> 01:17:22.870
    You have no idea what I
     would have done to you

01:17:22.872 --> 01:17:24.255
        five years ago!

01:17:24.256 --> 01:17:25.639
Let's get the fuck out of here,
             boys.

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.023
     We got a deal to make!

01:17:27.024 --> 01:17:28.407
   - Guys please, no please.

01:17:28.411 --> 01:17:29.710
         Please, Jesse.

01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:30.378
          Please, no.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.780
          (screaming)

01:17:32.782 --> 01:17:34.048
         Jesse, please!

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:36.751
            Please!

01:17:37.787 --> 01:17:38.886
      Untie my right hand?

01:17:38.888 --> 01:17:41.756
   - [Jesse] Fuck you, Dave!

01:17:41.758 --> 01:17:44.925
      (upbeat rock music)

01:17:44.927 --> 01:17:46.827
 - Holy shit, I didn't believe
           the money

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:48.429
    would actually be there.

01:17:48.431 --> 01:17:49.964
  Who was that dude who texted
              you?

01:17:49.966 --> 01:17:52.033
- I don't know, man, and I don't
             care.

01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:53.234
     We got our money back

01:17:53.236 --> 01:17:55.770
  and that's all that matters.

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:57.372
    - So what's the details?

01:17:57.373 --> 01:17:58.973
 What else we gotta know about
           this deal?

01:17:58.975 --> 01:18:02.109
   - The details are we show
     up, we drop the dough,

01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:05.112
  we grab our dip and we skip
             town.

01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.014
What other details do you need?

01:18:07.015 --> 01:18:08.915
     Should we stop off and
     buy him a dozen roses?

01:18:08.918 --> 01:18:11.419
   Maybe a box of chocolates
     too while we're at it?

01:18:11.421 --> 01:18:12.953
       - Oh, chocolates?

01:18:12.955 --> 01:18:13.954
           I'm down.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:19.860
    (tense electronic music)

01:19:01.037 --> 01:19:04.939
   - Hey man, we're here for
   Cyrus to pick up an order?

01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:08.008
 - Just wait here and shut the
            fuck up.

01:19:08.010 --> 01:19:09.210
         They're here.

01:19:11.414 --> 01:19:13.447
 - The hell did he get us into?

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:15.116
   - This does not look good.

01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:17.518
- He just told Darcy to shut the
            fuck up.

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.220
    - Glad you can make it.

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:20.488
         Right on time.

01:19:21.491 --> 01:19:23.090
        I dig that shit.

01:19:24.393 --> 01:19:26.160
What the fuck are you doing with
            that RV?

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.196
       - Yeah man, sorry.

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.231
     It's the best I could
    do on such short notice.

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.767
But I think we can pack the shit
           in there.

01:19:32.769 --> 01:19:35.369
- All right, where's the money?

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:38.139
     - I got it right here.

01:19:39.308 --> 01:19:40.641
           - Perfect.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:41.975
  Joel, check it up, make sure
           it's fine

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:44.779
while I make my way down there.

01:19:55.158 --> 01:19:56.223
      They mean business?

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:57.925
    - Yeah, it's all there.

01:19:57.927 --> 01:19:59.393
            - Good.

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:00.561
          I like you.

01:20:00.563 --> 01:20:02.380
       I like you a lot.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.198
   You see how this man does
           business?

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.067
 Straight cut and to the point.

01:20:07.069 --> 01:20:11.238
     First, you three need
     to step the fuck back.

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.373
   This doesn't concern you.

01:20:17.246 --> 01:20:19.480
Now this is how it shall always
              be.

01:20:19.482 --> 01:20:22.249
     You give me my money I
     give you your product.

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:24.018
     See how easy that was?

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.921
      Darcy here is a true
          businessman.

01:20:26.923 --> 01:20:30.191
    I think we can all learn
      from this endeavor.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:31.525
 Do you wanna see your product?

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.044
          - Of course.

01:20:33.045 --> 01:20:34.562
  I hear it's some good shit.

01:20:34.564 --> 01:20:38.232
- Straight off of the fields of
           Kentucky.

01:20:49.445 --> 01:20:52.346
  - Wow man, that is some good
             shit.

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:54.415
    My boys here, they're my
           partners.

01:20:54.417 --> 01:20:57.051
      They'll be handling
   logistics moving forward.

01:20:57.053 --> 01:20:58.953
 I'm gonna share this with them
          real quick.

01:20:58.955 --> 01:21:00.644
       - Take your time.

01:21:00.645 --> 01:21:02.334
 We're almost done filling them
             boxes

01:21:02.335 --> 01:21:04.024
  and then we'll start loading
            them up.

01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:06.327
     Wait a second, Darcy.

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:08.262
I wanna ask you a little favor.

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.598
 I'll be sure to make it worth
          your while.

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:12.433
  - What kind of favor are we
            talking?

01:21:12.435 --> 01:21:14.802
       - Nothing too big.

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:17.170
 Something you could definitely
            handle.

01:21:18.474 --> 01:21:21.175
    I just need you to take
     that pallet over there

01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:23.110
 to a buddy of mine in Arizona.

01:21:23.112 --> 01:21:24.311
         - What is it?

01:21:25.915 --> 01:21:28.382
     - Just behind schedule
           inventory.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:31.652
        (phone chiming)

01:21:31.654 --> 01:21:33.187
     - What's in the boxes?

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:34.588
        - Just more dip.

01:21:34.590 --> 01:21:38.058
   I really need you to do me
   this little favor, Darcy.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.960
   I mean, you're a business
      man, you understand.

01:21:39.962 --> 01:21:43.163
        (phone chiming)

01:21:43.165 --> 01:21:44.932
  - [Darcy] Can I at least see
  what's in the fucking boxes?

01:21:44.934 --> 01:21:46.400
  - Who the fuck keeps texting
              you?

01:21:46.402 --> 01:21:48.535
    We're doing a deal here.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:52.106
           (clanging)

01:21:52.642 --> 01:21:54.642
            Ah damn.

01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:56.643
   You really gone and wasted
  some perfectly good product.

01:21:56.646 --> 01:21:58.145
  You weren't supposed to see
             that.

01:21:58.147 --> 01:22:00.114
    - Hey, hey, hey, listen.

01:22:00.116 --> 01:22:02.249
We're just here to get the dip.

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.385
 We don't care what else you're
             into.

01:22:04.387 --> 01:22:06.654
Just take the money, we'll take
            the dip

01:22:06.656 --> 01:22:09.990
 and pretend like we never saw
           anything.

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:13.127
 - I wish it were that simple.

01:22:13.129 --> 01:22:15.062
Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:22:15.064 --> 01:22:16.831
      - I don't know, man.

01:22:16.832 --> 01:22:18.599
   I just keep getting random
    texts and random calls.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.035
 Thought it was a wrong number.

01:22:21.037 --> 01:22:23.637
     - You really think you
    can do a one over on me?

01:22:23.639 --> 01:22:25.606
You got three seconds to tell me

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.574
  what the fuck you're really
          doing here!

01:22:27.576 --> 01:22:28.575
           One, two!

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:34.114
 - DEA, everyone put your guns
             down.

01:22:34.116 --> 01:22:35.549
Everyone put your guns down now

01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.584
        or we open fire!

01:22:37.586 --> 01:22:40.654
    I repeat, everybody put
    your fucking guns down!

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:42.289
  - We all know how this turns
              out.

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.291
         (guns firing)

01:22:44.293 --> 01:22:49.430
       - [Chris] Go, go!
 (suspenseful orchestral music)

01:23:00.142 --> 01:23:05.279
          (gun firing)
        (siren wailing)

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:11.485
        - [Jesse] Gate.

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:12.753
         Open the gate!

01:23:16.525 --> 01:23:18.025
      - Hey, there's those
   motherfuckers right there!

01:23:18.027 --> 01:23:19.026
           Fuck them!

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.431
  - Fuck, we're cornered, get
    under the fucking truck.

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:27.167
         (guns firing)

01:23:32.174 --> 01:23:34.508
           (grunting)

01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:39.313
         (guns firing)

01:23:56.432 --> 01:23:58.098
Oh god boys, I think this is it.

01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.400
 - What do you mean this is it?

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:00.418
       (gunshots firing)

01:24:00.419 --> 01:24:01.435
 How the fuck did this happen?

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:02.569
       - [All] Oh, shit!

01:24:02.571 --> 01:24:03.704
    - What the fuck, Darcy?

01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.456
          - Holy shit!

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.207
    - What's the worst that
    can happen, right Darcy?

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:08.575
         (guns firing)

01:24:08.577 --> 01:24:10.077
   Where the hell's he going?

01:24:10.079 --> 01:24:11.078
           What dude?

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:17.818
          (gun firing)

01:24:19.255 --> 01:24:20.587
        - Motherfucker!

01:24:21.690 --> 01:24:25.359
    (grand orchestral music)

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:30.497
     - Take that dick, you
          cocksucker!

01:24:37.273 --> 01:24:39.796
            - Clear.

01:24:39.797 --> 01:24:42.320
        (siren wailing)
   (police radio chattering)

01:24:42.321 --> 01:24:44.844
   Well, looks like you guys
handled yourselves pretty well.

01:24:44.847 --> 01:24:46.246
        - Wait a second.

01:24:46.248 --> 01:24:47.648
 You're the fuck from the bar!

01:24:47.650 --> 01:24:50.484
- Okay, I'll take that, cowboy,
           thank you.

01:24:50.486 --> 01:24:52.153
             - Oh.

01:24:52.154 --> 01:24:53.821
You helped us get our money back
           in Vegas.

01:24:53.823 --> 01:24:56.590
 - What the hell man, you dirty
             bitch.

01:24:56.592 --> 01:24:58.459
    - What can I say, I just
      needed a little help

01:24:58.461 --> 01:25:00.194
       catching this guy.

01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:02.162
 Look I didn't expect it to go
           this far.

01:25:02.164 --> 01:25:04.765
  I had no idea an RV could go
           that fast.

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:06.100
We're just trying to figure out

01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:07.818
 where they package the stuff.

01:25:07.819 --> 01:25:09.535
 - What the fuck man, you used
           us, again!

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:10.838
        We almost died!

01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:12.707
  - Ah, you didn't almost die.

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:14.575
    We were watching you the
   whole time, you were fine.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:17.211
   This guy and his crew have
   been doing the same thing

01:25:17.213 --> 01:25:20.114
    for years, running drugs
 through legitimate businesses.

01:25:20.116 --> 01:25:22.649
   And now their new deal is
  apparently smuggling heroin

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:24.351
          in dip cans.

01:25:24.353 --> 01:25:26.553
     That little favor you
    were gonna do for Cyrus

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:30.824
   is worth about 26 million
    dollars on the streets.

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:32.593
   And he was just gonna turn
     around and do it again

01:25:32.595 --> 01:25:35.362
  because the dip always comes
          back to him.

01:25:35.364 --> 01:25:37.431
  And you guys, well, you were
         gonna wind up

01:25:37.433 --> 01:25:38.832
        with four holes.

01:25:40.302 --> 01:25:42.069
          - Well shit.

01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:43.837
 Good to know law enforcement's
    doing their fucking job.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:45.339
    - What the fuck, Darcy?
          - Ow, shit.

01:25:45.341 --> 01:25:47.741
  - This guy is fucking dead!

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:48.742
             Whoo.

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:51.545
- What the hell are we gonna do?

01:25:51.547 --> 01:25:54.248
I just wanna grab my dip, get in
             the RV

01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:55.966
     and go the fuck home!

01:25:55.967 --> 01:25:57.683
    - Can I get this fucking
  bullet out of my arm first?

01:25:57.686 --> 01:25:59.820
 - We'll get that bullet out of
           your arm.

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:02.756
 About that dip, I got bad news
            for you.

01:26:02.758 --> 01:26:04.358
   I know you guys have been
         through a lot

01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.759
 but unfortunately, we're gonna
              have

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:07.628
     to confiscate the dip.

01:26:07.630 --> 01:26:09.213
         (all groaning)

01:26:09.214 --> 01:26:10.797
 It's now considered a Federal
          crime scene

01:26:10.799 --> 01:26:11.798
      and that's evidence.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.700
      So look, I'm sorry.

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:15.502
      - This is bullshit!

01:26:16.672 --> 01:26:18.372
 - Tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:26:18.374 --> 01:26:20.474
     When all this is over,

01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:22.709
  I will pay you guys a visit.

01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:26.213
Your country owes you a debt of
           gratitude.

01:26:26.215 --> 01:26:29.950
      All right, come on,
   let's get you patched up.

01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:37.224
  - So I know it's been a few
         months, boys,

01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:39.293
 but I'm glad you made it back
             here.

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:41.128
          - Ah, yeah.

01:26:41.129 --> 01:26:42.962
    Needed some time to cool
  off from that damn dip run.

01:26:42.963 --> 01:26:44.796
      - Yeah, it's good to
     be back with you guys.

01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.633
          Let's party.

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:48.467
   - Hey, as long as it's not
  transfusion night, I'm down.

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:50.304
       - Fuck that place.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:52.339
 Right, let's just keep it low
              key,

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:53.774
have a few beers in my backyard.

01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:57.344
No road trips for a while, boys.

01:26:57.346 --> 01:27:00.280
        (phone chiming)

01:27:00.282 --> 01:27:01.281
           Oh, shit.

01:27:02.418 --> 01:27:04.251
      Listen to this text.

01:27:04.253 --> 01:27:05.652
       "Don't go nowhere.

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:07.221
     "I'm still listening."

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:07.888
             Sorry.

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.145
           - Ah shit.

01:27:09.146 --> 01:27:10.401
I knew they were still listening
              in.

01:27:10.402 --> 01:27:11.657
- Is that that asshole DEA agent
             again?

01:27:11.660 --> 01:27:13.076
         - Oh hell no.

01:27:13.077 --> 01:27:14.493
   I'd rather do the opposite
     of what that guy says.

01:27:14.496 --> 01:27:15.495
            I'm out.

01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:20.734
     - Whoah, where do you
  think you're going, cowboy?

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:21.668
            - What?

01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.153
           What the?

01:27:23.154 --> 01:27:24.637
    - Oh, look at you guys.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.640
  So great to see that you're
    all back together again.

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:29.943
     But then again I knew
   that, that's why I'm here.

01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:31.612
   Why don't you have a seat?

01:27:31.614 --> 01:27:32.913
 - [Darcy] What's bring you out
             here?

01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:33.981
   Our dip run days are over.

01:27:33.983 --> 01:27:35.683
       - I know, I know.

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:37.384
  And believe me, I won't take
   up too much of your time.

01:27:37.386 --> 01:27:39.019
I know you're all eager to have
              beer

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:40.654
      in Darcy's backyard.

01:27:40.656 --> 01:27:42.856
The bust that you helped us with

01:27:42.858 --> 01:27:46.293
    helped us to locate the
     main distribution hub

01:27:46.295 --> 01:27:48.979
         of 22 states.

01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:51.664
     The Federal Government
          confiscated
   about 1.4 billion dollars

01:27:51.667 --> 01:27:53.617
        worth of heroin.

01:27:53.618 --> 01:27:55.568
    And we made 236 arrests
     all over the country.

01:27:55.571 --> 01:27:57.738
     So on behalf of the US
          Government,

01:27:57.740 --> 01:28:01.375
 I am here to offer you a piece
          of the pie.

01:28:01.377 --> 01:28:03.060
     A reward if you will.

01:28:03.061 --> 01:28:04.744
  - Finally, what's the reward
         looking like?

01:28:04.747 --> 01:28:06.280
   - Yeah, show us the money.

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:07.881
 - Well, don't get too excited.

01:28:07.883 --> 01:28:11.318
   It's probably not as much
    as you're hoping it is.

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:14.621
   I did what I could, but it
  is the government after all

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:16.556
so in the end you're only gonna
              see

01:28:16.558 --> 01:28:19.693
   right around seven million
            dollars.

01:28:19.695 --> 01:28:20.627
           (exhaling)

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:21.561
            - What?

01:28:21.563 --> 01:28:23.664
        (all chattering)

01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:25.082
     - And we got your dip.

01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:26.499
And we're gonna set you up with
           a company

01:28:26.502 --> 01:28:28.502
 with legitimate distribution.

01:28:28.504 --> 01:28:32.372
   Here is the paperwork for
     your 10 year contract.

01:28:32.374 --> 01:28:34.641
    Oh, and before I forget.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:35.642
             Angel.

01:28:36.745 --> 01:28:38.812
   Angel's got to bring you,

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.898
       yes, there we are.

01:28:40.899 --> 01:28:42.983
Oh and everything you make after
             today

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:46.586
 is going to be completely tax
             free.

01:28:46.588 --> 01:28:48.522
That's something that I did for
              you

01:28:48.524 --> 01:28:50.713
    just because I like you.

01:28:50.714 --> 01:28:52.903
   So please for the love of
    God, don't embarrass me.

01:28:52.904 --> 01:28:55.093
      Don't make me regret
     that I did this, okay?

01:28:56.398 --> 01:28:57.531
             - Oh!
            - Dick!

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.633
          - Holy shit.

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:04.638
Now that's how you do a dip run,
             boys.

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:11.645
   (upbeat electronic music)

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:26.626
          ¶ Rambler ¶

01:29:46.197 --> 01:29:48.447
- [Clapper] Scene 30 Bravo, take
              two.

01:29:48.450 --> 01:29:50.751
- Hard time reaching that button
           in front.

01:29:50.753 --> 01:29:51.669
       - [Man] All right.

01:29:51.670 --> 01:29:52.586
   - I was talking about sex.

01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:53.720

      - [Man] All right, I
  really can't see your head.

01:30:08.804 --> 01:30:10.971
You're gonna have to be a little
             more--

01:30:10.973 --> 01:30:13.573
  - Fuck, god damn, I knew it.

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:16.042
       - On the lap, boy.

01:30:17.112 --> 01:30:19.146

01:30:19.148 --> 01:30:20.013

      What you dippin' on?

   tobacco-free nicotine dip.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:35.762
   I've dipped a lot of stuff

01:40:35.763 --> 01:40:37.163

   Out of anywhere you could
   piss, you piss next to me?

       I don't know, man.

01:41:49.314 --> 01:41:51.359
   - [Man] What the hell are
   you doing on my property?

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.405
  - I can barely freaking see
  you with that camo shirt on.

 Do you think he likes sausage.

01:41:57.359 --> 01:41:58.675

    but he's getting closer.

01:41:58.680 --> 01:41:59.891
           - Thanks.

01:41:59.892 --> 01:42:01.103
You look pretty good in yellow,

            Oh shit.

01:42:19.534 --> 01:42:22.168

           four cans

01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:24.770
 quicker than you can pack one,
            Skippy.

Put your money where your mouth
              is.

01:42:29.153 --> 01:42:30.408
      I'm the king of dip.

            - What?

01:42:32.813 --> 01:42:34.079
    I'm the Superman of dip.

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:35.346
 - Well, where's your freaking
           cape then?

01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:37.517
- Hey, no, I'm the juice of dip.

01:42:37.519 --> 01:42:39.185

01:42:39.187 --> 01:42:40.186

              No!

01:42:42.624 --> 01:42:43.856

01:42:43.858 --> 01:42:45.191
    - [Chris] Jesse get up.

01:42:45.193 --> 01:42:46.425
   - [Jesse] Ow, he's on me.

01:42:46.427 --> 01:42:48.261
          Get him off!

01:42:48.263 --> 01:42:49.212
       Get him off of me!

01:42:49.213 --> 01:42:50.162
       - [Chris] Get off!

01:42:50.165 --> 01:42:51.548
     - I'm the dip doctor.

01:42:51.549 --> 01:42:52.932
 - Does a dip doctor prescribe
          that sitdoll

01:42:52.934 --> 01:42:55.201
    on your freaking biceps?

01:42:55.203 --> 01:42:56.269
          - Fuck off!

01:42:57.438 --> 01:42:58.471
