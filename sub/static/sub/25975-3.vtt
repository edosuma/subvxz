WEBVTT

00:11.170 --> 00:13.161
[chattering]

00:14.800 --> 00:16.631
[woman] Senator Blake, can we have a word?

00:16.720 --> 00:17.709
Yeah, the word is "no."

00:17.800 --> 00:19.427
The casino bill. You opposed it,

00:19.510 --> 00:21.091
called it another
Charles Wilkes boondoggle.

00:22.560 --> 00:23.800
I had a family emergency.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.471
[woman] There are whispers
you made a deal with Wilkes.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.266
Whispers? Is that what passes
for reporting now?

00:27.360 --> 00:29.646
I'm giving you a chance
to clear the record, Senator.

00:30.650 --> 00:32.106
God damn it, do I need to call security?

00:32.190 --> 00:33.600
If you'd just make a statement.

00:33.700 --> 00:34.735
You want my statement?

00:34.820 --> 00:35.980
Here ’5 my statement

00:36.070 --> 00:38.118
The media can go fuck itse/ﬁ

00:39.450 --> 00:41.691
Angie, call the Capitol Police.

00:44.080 --> 00:45.991
He is not gonna like how that looks
when it leads tonight.

00:46.080 --> 00:47.627
Do I really need to make this call?

00:47.710 --> 00:48.995
Okay, okay. We're leaving.

00:49.090 --> 00:49.988
But this is public property,

00:50.090 --> 00:51.205
-and the press is entitled--
-[gunshot]

00:51.300 --> 00:52.585
[gaSPSI

00:56.680 --> 00:57.795
[Angie]
Oh, my God!

01:20.620 --> 01:22.611
[doorbell rings]

01:24.750 --> 01:26.820
-[Wendy] Have you seen it?
-[Wilkes] Yeah. Come on in.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.490
[Wendy] It's running non-stop.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.837
And that reporter
was asking about our bill.

01:32.420 --> 01:35.969
-She was asking about you.
-Yeah. She called me for a statement.

01:36.550 --> 01:37.539
[Wendy] What did you say?

01:38.050 --> 01:39.677
[Wilkes] What did I say?
That it was a tragedy.

01:40.260 --> 01:43.343
My prayers go out to his family.
[breathes deeply]

01:43.430 --> 01:46.342
Blake had a history of depression
and hospitalizations, okay?

01:46.430 --> 01:47.340
No one knew.

01:47.850 --> 01:50.432
It's a sad fact, but sometimes
depressed people kill themselves.

01:51.940 --> 01:53.567
That's what you had on him?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.276
His psychiatric record?
That's what you were gonna expose?

01:57.360 --> 02:00.193
He was in a business
where there's no room for secrets.

02:00.280 --> 02:01.360
You know that.

02:02.240 --> 02:03.696
Let me get you some coffee.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.069
[sighs]

02:08.290 --> 02:09.325
[Wendy] What is this?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.789
[Wilkes] Oh.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.507
I wasn't ready to quite talk
about it yet, but, uh...

02:18.590 --> 02:19.796
That's our casino.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.714
Yeah, plus a 300-room hotel,
upscale mall, green space.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.461
Hmm. I've been waiting for something.

02:27.350 --> 02:28.419
It's just business, Wendy.

02:28.520 --> 02:31.182
Well, have you talked to the Snells?
It's their land.

02:31.270 --> 02:33.477
-I was counting on you for that.
-You're counting wrong.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.813
[stammers] The Snells are proud people.
They will never sell.

02:37.900 --> 02:40.232
-They haven't heard my offer.
-It doesn't matter.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.027
-We can discuss other possibilities--
-There's nothing to discuss.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.519
This is what I want.

02:46.830 --> 02:48.195
I don't wanna fight with you.

02:48.790 --> 02:52.248
You and your husband need this casino.
I can deliver it, or I can kill it.

03:10.060 --> 03:12.267
[door opens]

03:13.230 --> 03:15.266
You can't just walk in here like this.

03:16.190 --> 03:17.270
What if I was dressing?

03:19.070 --> 03:21.857
[Cade] You really think I'm gonna
see something that shocks me?

03:23.660 --> 03:26.072
And you got a fucking job to see about.

03:29.370 --> 03:30.906
[breathes deeply]

03:33.420 --> 03:37.299
I'm sorry I laid hands on you.

03:42.510 --> 03:44.250
You sound like your brother.

03:44.340 --> 03:48.709
Hmm. Ijust gotta
get myself re-socialized, I guess.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.972
There is no excuse.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.976
-Hmm.
-Can you forgive me?

04:01.900 --> 04:04.778
You wanna talk about a house,
all that shit?

04:05.370 --> 04:06.405
I'll listen.

04:09.290 --> 04:10.439
No.

04:12.290 --> 04:13.405
You're right.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.161
That's not for us.

04:28.930 --> 04:31.137
[Marty] You know, obviously,
we're in the off-season now,

04:31.220 --> 04:32.801
so most of the work's
gonna be maintenance.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.972
[Cade] Seems to me the eaves need cleaning

04:35.060 --> 04:37.802
and the, uh, cabins could use
a fresh coat of paint.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.686
Looks like you haven't
winterized that dock, either.

04:39.770 --> 04:42.147
There's gonna be hell to pay
if we get an early ice storm.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.480
[Marty] Yeah, that's true.

04:43.570 --> 04:46.562
Listen, um, all that sounds perfect.
How soon can you start?

04:46.660 --> 04:48.946
[Cade] Oh, I'm not interested.

04:51.160 --> 04:54.823
Manual labor, weather stripping cabins,
roofing work...

04:54.910 --> 04:56.457
You ever done anything like that?

04:57.170 --> 04:58.535
Ruth said that you were looking for a job.

04:58.630 --> 05:04.000
No. I need a paycheck, an employer,
as per conditions of my parole.

05:05.800 --> 05:06.960
-I see.
-Mmm.

05:07.050 --> 05:09.382
You expect me to just give you that
without the work part of the work?

05:09.470 --> 05:12.382
It seems about right,
after all my daughter done for you.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.589
I'm not sure I follow.

05:16.690 --> 05:17.975
I think you do.

05:19.650 --> 05:23.984
Patricide was my crime.
I learned that word in the prison library.

05:24.070 --> 05:27.028
But what the fuck is the word
for a girl killing her uncles?

05:33.080 --> 05:35.071
I'm sorry things didn't work out
for you here.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.827
I'd think about that offer if I was you.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.586
[Marty] I don't need to.

05:42.880 --> 05:44.757
[woman] That's Elena Del Rio
under that veil,

05:44.840 --> 05:46.159
stepping out of an Escalade.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.376
Mexico's archbishop blessing her.

05:48.970 --> 05:51.928
Jorge Mendoza and a few others
entering the cathedral.

05:52.510 --> 05:55.923
They don't have a body,but this was
definitely Del's memorial service.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.181
[woman 2] Financial structure,
Agent Evans?

05:58.270 --> 06:00.397
We've made some progress from last time.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.438
We now know Paradise LP,
a limited Delaware company,

06:04.530 --> 06:07.522
is owned, at least in part,
by this numbered company

06:07.610 --> 06:08.986
that we've named El Diablo.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.861
Based in Mexico City.

06:10.950 --> 06:14.408
-Who's the other owner of Paradise?
-That's the billion dollar question.

06:14.490 --> 06:17.243
Some operating capital
recently came out of Bermuda

06:17.330 --> 06:19.457
by way of Singapore and Panama.

06:20.040 --> 06:22.622
A pattern that we're hoping
to trace to Martin Byrde.

06:22.710 --> 06:25.793
-[woman 2] Agent Petty?
-Uh, I have a good new CI.

06:25.880 --> 06:28.257
How's this one different than the last?

06:28.760 --> 06:30.296
Other than not being dead.

06:31.090 --> 06:34.548
Well, they're much closer to Byrde.
Better access to the books.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.760
Revised time line?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.091
A month to a warrant. Two, tops.

06:40.850 --> 06:42.727
[FBI agent] Agent Evans, do you concur?

06:44.400 --> 06:46.812
Two or three months seems possible.

06:51.360 --> 06:53.442
Do better than you've been doing.

06:55.870 --> 06:57.497
See you all in a month.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.753
[Petty clears throat] Hey.

07:11.550 --> 07:12.710
Thanks for the backup.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.556
With the shit you pulled,

07:15.640 --> 07:17.631
you're lucky
I haven't taken your knees out.

07:17.720 --> 07:18.709
[Petty scoffs]

07:19.980 --> 07:23.552
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go. Follow.

07:33.700 --> 07:34.985
[Marty] You mind telling me
what you were thinking

07:35.070 --> 07:37.698
by telling your dad about Russ and Boyd?

07:37.790 --> 07:41.078
I mean, isn't the idea that
if you wanna get away with something,

07:41.160 --> 07:42.320
you don't tell anyone?

07:43.080 --> 07:45.412
I don't know, Marty, if you say so.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.627
I must have ditched that day
in crime school.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.666
Hey, Ruth, he's using it
to try to extort me,

07:49.760 --> 07:51.967
so I'd like to know
why you decided to tell him.

07:52.050 --> 07:53.756
He figured it out, okay?

07:55.390 --> 07:57.881
-How?
-I don't know. He just did.

07:57.970 --> 08:00.131
Well, how did you explain
killing his brothers?

08:01.140 --> 08:04.849
I told him the truth.
I thought Russ was a fucking rat.

08:07.610 --> 08:08.474
What are you talking about?

08:10.190 --> 08:14.729
I found a bug in his trailer.
That shit didn't get there by accident.

08:14.820 --> 08:17.061
You found a bug in Russ' trailer?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.367
You didn't think that you should
mention that to me, Ruth?

08:19.950 --> 08:21.110
He's fucking dead.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.241
Okay, but whoever he was working with,

08:24.330 --> 08:26.491
unless you killed them too,
is probably still around.

08:26.580 --> 08:27.626
[man] Hello.

08:28.130 --> 08:29.791
We ain't open till 1:00. Hello. Anybody here?

08:33.170 --> 08:36.253
Touch-squirts always show up here early.
It's a fucking thing.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.057
-Black Label, rocks, Calvin?
-[Marty] Ruth.

08:40.140 --> 08:42.096
Hey. Ruth.

08:42.180 --> 08:44.262
-You Martin Byrde?
-Yeah.

08:45.980 --> 08:51.225
You're hereby shut down pursuant
to Missouri Statute 573537.

08:53.440 --> 08:54.600
"Improper layout"?

08:55.490 --> 08:58.618
Fire hazard.
Ingress and egress and all that.

08:59.120 --> 09:00.235
We'll just move some tables around.

09:00.330 --> 09:01.945
You're gonna have to take it up
with the state board.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.787
[man] There's missing fire-retardant
insulation in half the cabins.

09:06.870 --> 09:08.371
We also have concerns
about the dock Wiring,

09:08.460 --> 09:09.666
considering the recent deaths.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.457
[Marty stutters] That wiring was fixed
the day after it happened.

09:12.550 --> 09:15.417
-I don't understand why that's a problem.
-Not by someone licensed by the county.

09:15.510 --> 09:16.465
Are you the owner?

09:16.550 --> 09:19.132
'Cause every piece of paper I have here
lists the owner as Rachel Garrison.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.053
Yeah, yeah. Well, she's...
You know, she's away, but I'm a partner.

09:22.140 --> 09:23.346
I'm a silent partner, 50--

09:23.430 --> 09:26.228
Well, you can go back to being silent.
I need Miss Garrison.

09:27.850 --> 09:30.853
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Well, you know, she is away, sir.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.726
Well, I'd give her a call.

09:32.820 --> 09:35.232
Tell her she's shut down until she gets
in touch with our department.

09:35.320 --> 09:38.562
Shut down? Hang on.
She's not reachable, and I'm fully auth--

09:38.660 --> 09:39.649
[engine starts]

09:45.200 --> 09:46.246
[camera shutter clicks] [Marty] Hey, Tuck...

09:52.750 --> 09:54.411
when's the last time you spoke to Rachel?

09:56.510 --> 09:58.171
They hit the funeral home, too?

09:58.760 --> 09:59.579
What did they say?

09:59.680 --> 10:03.753
"Unusually high levels of dioxin
and mercury in the surrounding soil"?

10:03.850 --> 10:04.760
I mean, it's just...

10:06.230 --> 10:08.221
It's not a_coincidence.
Somebody IS targeting us.

10:08.810 --> 10:10.892
Could be whoever was working
with Russ Langmore.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.312
It's somebody with pull.
Three state agencies all at the same time?

10:14.730 --> 10:18.939
It's not the Snells. It's not KC mob.
They have no reason to hit us.

10:19.530 --> 10:20.656
What about Wilkes?

10:21.530 --> 10:22.440
[Marty] Wilkes?

10:23.700 --> 10:26.362
He finally made his ask.
I wasn't very receptive.

10:26.790 --> 10:28.246
What was his ask?

10:29.710 --> 10:32.702
He wants to build a hotel _
and a shopping mall next to the casrno.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.410
The Snells are never gonna go for that.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.968
That's what I told him.
And then he threatened us.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.088
So he's just gonna jam up hundreds
of thousands of dollars in cash,

10:42.180 --> 10:44.967
and I gotta explain that
to Chicago and to the Snells?

10:45.060 --> 10:47.676
-They're not gonna be happy about that.
-We can get another business.

10:48.270 --> 10:49.635
[Wendy] Where?

10:49.730 --> 10:51.220
I think I might have something.

10:51.310 --> 10:53.608
Well, appreciate it. Thank you, Ruth.

10:53.690 --> 10:55.180
But, you know,
we gotta get this up and running.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.099
Wendy, why don't you go
talk to Wilkes, please, and see if you can work something out.

10:58.610 --> 11:00.908
I'll see _if the Snells
have any Wiggle room at all.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.696
We've gotta go pick up the kids.

11:02.780 --> 11:04.611
[sighs] Fuck.

11:05.990 --> 11:07.537
[exhales]

11:08.120 --> 11:10.827
[Kevin] I don't see why I have to pay
for a B plus, dude.

11:11.750 --> 11:14.787
[Jonah] I wrote you an 89 paper.
You have a 78 average.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.757
C to an A too fast
and they're gonna find out.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.377
Then we're all screwed
and my busmess goes bust.

11:22.300 --> 11:24.632
I want a solid A
on my history project, though.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.767
-[Wendy] Where's your sister?
-[Jonah] Wyatt's.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.339
Is that a new friend?

11:31.850 --> 11:34.227
-Sorta.
-Oh.

11:50.250 --> 11:52.662
[wood creaking]

11:54.040 --> 11:57.419
-Well, what can I do for you?
-Hey, Taylor.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.122
Last I heard,
you were shooting your mouth off

12:01.220 --> 12:04.508
about demanding
that I deliver your boat myself.

12:05.010 --> 12:09.458
[Ruth] Well, I'm not here for that.
I got a business proposition.

12:10.270 --> 12:14.183
I heard you had money trouble,
and I wanna invest in your business.

12:14.270 --> 12:18.855
And here I was, all concerned
that you could pay your boat repair bill.

12:18.940 --> 12:21.022
I guess it must be my lucky day.

12:21.110 --> 12:24.352
Well, I'm working in an office:
Marty Byrde Enterprises.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.406
And he wants to invest in your business.

12:26.490 --> 12:27.775
You're serious?

12:27.870 --> 12:31.988
I can see rot and bend in these supports.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.912
And I bet you don't have money
for a breakwater.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.707
-[Taylor] Don't need one.
-[Ruth] That's where you're wrong.

12:37.790 --> 12:41.794
You've got all those fancy yachts
tooling around here during the summer.

12:42.170 --> 12:45.378
They can't even stop here for gas
if you got no breakwater.

12:45.470 --> 12:48.462
And we'll get you that breakwater
and that business.

12:48.970 --> 12:51.632
The place ain't for sale, Ruthie.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.181
We're not buying.

12:56.100 --> 13:00.560
We're just injecting some capital
in something we know can improve.

13:00.650 --> 13:01.776
Your boat's out back.

13:01.860 --> 13:05.398
I'll tell the boys to make sure you pay
before they give you the keys.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.120
[Wendy] Oh, Jesus, now what?

13:23.710 --> 13:26.588
[Marty sighs] Jonah, I want you
to go straight to your room, okay?

13:28.590 --> 13:30.592
Jacob. Darlene.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.886
You left a message for us.

13:32.970 --> 13:35.552
[Marty] Well, you didn't need
to respond in person. Hi.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.880
It sounded important.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.049
Well, uh, listen, it's cold.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.892
Why don't we go inside.
We can discuss it. Okay? Hi.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.858
It wouldn't have anything to do with
the man who showed up on our property,

13:44.940 --> 13:47.943
looking to turn our land
into a theme park, would it?

13:50.200 --> 13:51.861
You know what today is?

13:52.950 --> 13:53.780
No.

13:54.370 --> 13:55.997
I'll bet the boy knows.

13:57.750 --> 14:00.571
-First day of hunting season.
-Jonah, go inside.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.548
I haven't missed one in 50 years.

14:04.050 --> 14:05.790
I don't intend to start now.

14:07.090 --> 14:10.173
-So, what I suggest, Martin...
-[gun cocks]

14:10.260 --> 14:13.889
is you join us in the woods,
and we can talk privately.

14:14.310 --> 14:15.709
Get some things worked out.

14:17.430 --> 14:19.227
[Jonah] Is that a Remington 700?

14:19.310 --> 14:20.550
It is.

14:22.980 --> 14:26.529
Nightforce scope. You hunt, son?

14:26.610 --> 14:28.601
[Wendy] No. No, he doesn't.

14:28.700 --> 14:29.815
I'd like to.

14:30.660 --> 14:32.400
[Jacob] Go ahead. Now...

14:33.490 --> 14:37.278
all you gotta do is put the vest on.

14:37.370 --> 14:40.749
Well, our talk is about business,
and he's got schoolwork to do.

14:40.830 --> 14:41.910
No, I don't.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.206
[Jacob] He's old enough to learn our ways.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.423
-Jonah, honey, you're not going.
-[gun cocks]

14:52.140 --> 14:54.005
Anybody mind if I tag along?

14:55.260 --> 14:57.308
[Jacob] We move quick, old-timer.

15:00.690 --> 15:01.725
Let's go.

15:21.290 --> 15:22.496
[gunshot in distance]

15:22.580 --> 15:25.208
[Jacob] So, he's shut down
your businesses.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.048
That means all our money's tied up.

15:28.130 --> 15:29.757
[Marty] Yeah, temporarily.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.250
Unacceptable.

15:32.130 --> 15:36.214
I know it.
Wilkes is definitely sending us a message.

15:37.060 --> 15:41.303
Well, maybe you need to send him one back.

15:41.390 --> 15:42.345
[gunshot in distance]

15:42.440 --> 15:45.648
Some people only respond
to a certain kind of pressure.

15:45.730 --> 15:48.858
Yeah. Well, listen,
we are going to need Wilkes

15:48.940 --> 15:51.818
to help push our bid
through the gaming commission,

15:51.900 --> 15:55.358
so, uh, maybe there is a middle ground.

15:56.030 --> 16:00.649
I'm not selling any more land, Martin.
We've sacriﬁced enough.

16:00.750 --> 16:01.739
[gunshots continue]

16:02.620 --> 16:06.033
Jacob, if he kills this bid,
it's gonna hurt us all.

16:06.130 --> 16:08.246
Not everything is negotiable.

16:08.340 --> 16:09.329
[loud gunshot]

16:10.710 --> 16:14.089
I gotta stop. [breathing heavily]

16:14.180 --> 16:16.045
Hold on. [sniffs, grunts]

16:16.140 --> 16:17.289
[Marty] Buddy, you all right?

16:17.390 --> 16:19.255
-You okay?
-[Buddy] Never better.

16:19.350 --> 16:22.513
-You tired?
-No. [exhales]

16:24.560 --> 16:27.267
-Getting close.
-Good, good.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.396
-Quiet.
-Yep.

16:33.570 --> 16:34.901
[Marty] Ready?

16:34.990 --> 16:36.059
[Jacob] The thing is, Martin...

16:38.200 --> 16:42.899
anyone who's your enemy is now our enemy.

16:44.920 --> 16:48.458
I appreciate that, but I don't need you
to do anything. I got this.

16:49.040 --> 16:53.659
You got 24 hours.
If you can't persuade him, we will.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.727
You know, I don't really believe
in this sort of thing.

17:06.310 --> 17:09.017
-No harm in trying.
-[gunshot in distance]

17:12.030 --> 17:15.272
-When will they be back?
-Well, it depends.

17:17.450 --> 17:19.315
Strong heart line...

17:20.740 --> 17:22.571
and long marriage.

17:24.580 --> 17:27.822
This little circle here indicates
there's been some sadness.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.582
-Yeah, that's true of any marriage.
-Yes, it is.

17:31.460 --> 17:34.372
Now, your lifeline got a couple
of breaks here.

17:35.920 --> 17:36.921
And... Huh.

17:41.970 --> 17:42.880
That's it.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.419
What?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.841
-What did you see?
-What does it matter?

17:47.940 --> 17:49.680
You don't believe in this, anyway.

17:49.770 --> 17:52.568
Come on. You can't do that.
What did you see?

17:56.110 --> 17:57.520
You lost a child.

18:06.540 --> 18:07.916
[rustling]

18:15.050 --> 18:16.460
[whispers] Nice-looking buck.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.847
No, let the boy take him.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.303
You don't have to do this, okay?
Don't feel any pressure.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.991
-[gunshot]
-[birds screeching]

19:10.520 --> 19:13.182
-Your boy's first kill.
-[Marty] Hmm.

19:13.270 --> 19:14.396
We believe in blood.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.722
[stutters] Oh, no, no.
We don't need the blood. Thank you.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.357
It'd be disrespectful to the deer.

19:21.450 --> 19:22.656
It's okay, Dad.

19:44.510 --> 19:46.137
My thighs feel like pillows.

19:46.220 --> 19:47.209
[Wyatt chuckles]

19:50.810 --> 19:54.803
Hey, how come in five months,
you've never tried to kiss me?

19:59.230 --> 20:00.106
[Wyatt] Uh...

20:03.610 --> 20:06.238
I don't wanna just be
some story you tell someday

20:06.330 --> 20:11.654
at some dinner party or whatever to...
[inhales sharply]

20:11.750 --> 20:16.915
I don't know, to show that you've got,
like, real grit in your life or something.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.989
[door opens]

20:18.090 --> 20:21.378
Jesus. You can't even fucking see in here.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.381
You're supposed to be writing your essay.

20:26.890 --> 20:29.256
It's in my head. [laughs]

20:31.430 --> 20:34.092
Can you excuse us for a second?

20:36.980 --> 20:37.935
Yeah.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.771
[Charlotte sighs]

20:52.250 --> 20:56.698
That girl never ever has to worry
about getting into a college.

20:57.630 --> 21:01.293
Her daddy can just donate
a fucking library or something.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.756
It's different for you.

21:02.840 --> 21:06.219
Yes, I'm well aware
that it's different, Ruth.

21:06.300 --> 21:09.212
No, you need to take your seat
at the fucking table, Wyatt,

21:09.300 --> 21:10.756
and make your place.

21:10.850 --> 21:13.762
Look, I got nothing to say to those people

21:13.850 --> 21:16.182
that'll change the way
that they see me, okay?

21:16.770 --> 21:20.558
Then be who they want, then. Pretend.
I don't know. Lie. Just...

21:21.480 --> 21:23.107
Just write the essay, okay?

21:27.200 --> 21:28.315
Where are you going?

21:28.410 --> 21:30.446
[Wyatt] I'll write the fucking thing.
I gotta drive Charlotte home.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.236
Wait. No, no, no. You're wasted.

21:32.330 --> 21:33.490
There's back roads.

21:37.620 --> 21:40.339
[doorbell rings]

21:43.840 --> 21:44.659
Mrs. Byrde.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.467
I wanna talk to Charlie.

21:49.800 --> 21:51.210
He's not returning my calls.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.801
Well, that probably means
he doesn't wanna talk to you.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.393
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm finishing up some work for him here--

21:58.480 --> 21:59.799
Is he shutting down our businesses?

22:00.400 --> 22:02.857
-I have no idea what you're talking about.
-You are full of shit.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.602
He is pressuring us
to get the Snells to sell him the land.

22:06.280 --> 22:09.738
-Has your answer changed?
-It's not possible.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.824
Mr. Wilkes doesn't believe
anything is impossible.

22:13.910 --> 22:16.788
That's Why he's been
as successful as he's been.

22:16.870 --> 22:19.202
Well, he's behaving like a spoiled brat.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.627
I'll pass along your message.

22:54.240 --> 22:56.231
[door opens]

22:58.710 --> 22:59.995
-[door closes]
-Tuck?

23:16.260 --> 23:17.170
Hi.

23:19.850 --> 23:22.057
You got a lot of nerve,
calling me back here.

23:22.150 --> 23:24.550
-[scoffs] I've got nerve?
-That's right.

23:24.650 --> 23:27.141
You stole $300,000 from me, Rachel.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.312
That I found in my wall of my business.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.359
Do you think that I'm afraid to tell
my partners that I lost their money?

23:33.450 --> 23:35.577
How does hanging from a bridge
sound to you?

23:35.660 --> 23:36.695
Fuck you, Marty.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.531
Hang on. Hey, hey. Rachel, Rachel.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.536
I'll keep them out of this

23:45.710 --> 23:48.918
if you help me
get this place up and running again,

23:49.010 --> 23:53.003
because apparently, you're the only person
that the inspector Will deal With.

23:54.430 --> 23:55.545
Okay? Please?

23:56.470 --> 24:01.635
And I need you to be the face
of this place for an investigation.

24:04.400 --> 24:05.856
Who's investigating you?

24:06.940 --> 24:11.525
The gaming commission.
I'm opening a casino somewhere else.

24:12.820 --> 24:14.230
-Of course you are.
-Mm-hmm.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.652
Preying on addicts and hillbillies.

24:19.700 --> 24:22.498
For the record, I'm only here
'cause Tuck said he needed me...

24:22.580 --> 24:24.536
-Okay.
-to protect his job.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.200
You threaten him?

24:28.170 --> 24:29.410
Of course not.

24:31.510 --> 24:33.876
You don't even know what's a lie
and what's the truth, do you?

24:38.760 --> 24:40.341
[sighs]

24:40.430 --> 24:41.761
Oh, fuck. God.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.438
[gasps] Oh, you scared me.

24:49.150 --> 24:50.310
I couldn't sleep.

24:52.320 --> 24:53.605
Are you okay?

24:57.910 --> 24:58.979
You know...

25:00.990 --> 25:03.709
I only went hunting once as a kid.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.837
I couldn't do it again after that.

25:16.380 --> 25:18.382
Why did you ask me to kill that man?

25:20.430 --> 25:23.263
You nodded at me to pull the trigger,
and I did.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.806
Honey, I thought he was gonna kill us.

25:31.440 --> 25:35.604
If I'd done it, would you have thought
of me as a murderer?

25:35.700 --> 25:36.985
No, no.

25:38.660 --> 25:43.029
I would have thanked you
for your unbelievable bravery.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.832
Mind ifI stay up a little longer?

25:58.800 --> 26:00.256
Can I sit up with you?

26:16.530 --> 26:18.771
[Marty] Okay. But, sir,
the weekend is the only time

26:18.860 --> 26:21.067
that the club makes any money
in the off-season.

26:23.030 --> 26:27.148
If you don't re-inspect,
then we can't get our clearance letter,

26:27.250 --> 26:29.912
and then we can't get our license back,
Which means we can't re-open,

26:30.000 --> 26:32.457
so, you know,
I'll meet you anytime that you want.

26:34.090 --> 26:35.705
Great. Thank you.

26:36.210 --> 26:37.290
Pnck.

26:37.840 --> 26:38.875
[knock on door]

26:40.220 --> 26:41.881
-Hel|o.
-Hi. Are you Wendy Byrde?

26:41.970 --> 26:44.256
-I am.
-I'm Janet Rayner with KZYO News.

26:44.350 --> 26:45.510
I know Who you are.

26:45.600 --> 26:46.760
I was hoping
I could ask you a few questions

26:46.850 --> 26:48.477
about Charles Wilkes and Tim Blake.

26:49.980 --> 26:53.768
I'm sorry. [stutters]
I don't really have anything to say.

26:53.860 --> 26:56.067
You and Wilkes worked together
to pass a casino bill?

26:56.900 --> 26:59.778
Well, we have no official relationship
With Charles Wilkes.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.693
Okay, but unofficially,
you lobbied senators with Wilkes.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.190
I'm sorry, I have no comment.

27:06.290 --> 27:09.077
Mrs. Byrde, we can talk on background
or off the record if you want.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.037
I don't mean to be rude, but...

27:11.120 --> 27:13.076
I really think
you should leave the property now.

27:13.170 --> 27:14.785
Did you know that Tim Blake's widow

27:14.880 --> 27:17.257
is filing a wrongful death suit
against Charles Wilkes?

27:17.760 --> 27:19.125
That's crazy.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.040
She's going to announce it at his funeral.

27:21.930 --> 27:23.295
But he was clinically depressed.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.250
How do you know that?

27:28.020 --> 27:29.840
Thank you so much for stopping by.

27:57.050 --> 28:01.293
"A mortgage applicant agrees to pay
to consult an attorney.

28:01.380 --> 28:02.961
Do not sign.

28:06.050 --> 28:08.052
If this is..."
[continues reading indistinctly]

28:22.240 --> 28:23.446
I was just looking.

28:23.530 --> 28:25.157
Yeah, looking to move.

28:26.070 --> 28:31.155
You wanna lie to me, girl,
[breathes deeply] fine, I get it.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.530
But you're lying to yourself,

28:34.580 --> 28:37.242
and you're filling Wyatt's head
With lies, too.

28:38.380 --> 28:39.290
College.

28:39.380 --> 28:44.465
I have a real job, Daddy,
in an office, With responsibilities.

28:45.090 --> 28:48.753
Tell me what they've ever asked you to do
'sides their dirty work.

28:52.560 --> 28:56.394
You're a Langmore, baby girl.
You carry the weight of that name.

28:58.110 --> 29:01.819
I know it. The rest of the world knows it.

29:01.900 --> 29:06.018
Seems like the only one
Who doesn't understand is you.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.956
[woman] So, you're here
to open a bank account.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.030
Yeah. I know I'm supposed
to have an adult present,

29:19.130 --> 29:21.291
but my mom's running errands.

29:21.380 --> 29:24.759
She gave me these papers and signed
all the forms she's supposed to.

29:25.720 --> 29:26.675
All right.

29:28.140 --> 29:30.005
Looks like everything is here.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.221
Filled out correctly.

29:34.890 --> 29:37.222
Let's just give your mom
a quick call to confirm.

29:37.310 --> 29:40.313
-What's her number?
-I have her on speed dial.

29:41.940 --> 29:44.067
-[line rings]
-[Woman] Oh.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.769
[Charlotte]
Hello.

29:46.860 --> 29:49.067
Hello. This is Connie at the bank.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.946
Hi. I'd be there myself, but I've been stuck
at the dog groomer's all day.

29:53.410 --> 29:55.492
He definitely has my permission.

29:55.580 --> 29:57.536
[Connie] And $5,000 is correct?

29:58.420 --> 30:00.126
$5,000, that's correct.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.955
[Connie]
All right; well, thank you.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.007
Your mom sounds nice.

30:06.090 --> 30:07.170
It's the weekend.

30:07.260 --> 30:08.750
Do you have a passport?

30:08.840 --> 30:10.592
Oh, yeah.

30:11.640 --> 30:13.767
And what name
do you want the account under?

30:13.850 --> 30:16.171
Mine. Michael Fleming.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.991
[chattering]

30:41.080 --> 30:44.083
Hi. I'm looking for Mrs. Blake.

30:45.000 --> 30:46.080
I'm Susan Blake.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.503
Mrs. Blake, I am so sorry
for your loss. I...

30:50.800 --> 30:54.054
I wanted to come and pay my respects.
I'm Wendy Byrde.

30:54.930 --> 30:56.841
-Hi.
-This is a shepherd's pie.

30:56.930 --> 31:00.388
Oh. Thank you. Were you friends With Tim?

31:01.650 --> 31:02.639
We met once.

31:04.150 --> 31:05.720
I know this is a terrible time,

31:05.820 --> 31:07.936
but is there a place
we could speak privately?

31:09.280 --> 31:12.317
[Wendy] Oh, what a beautiful family.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.480
[Susan chuckles] Thank you.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.321
How did you know Tim?

31:17.370 --> 31:18.780
Uh... [sighs]

31:19.710 --> 31:22.281
To be honest, we were
on the opposite sides of an issue.

31:23.330 --> 31:24.160
Oh.

31:25.380 --> 31:27.757
He was against a bill I was backing.

31:27.840 --> 31:32.425
-[chuckles] Tim could be a tough opponent.
-Yes. Yes, he could.

31:32.510 --> 31:33.499
Are you a lobbyist?

31:34.430 --> 31:39.800
No. My husband and I own a company
that's investing in a new casino.

31:43.020 --> 31:45.011
You work with Charles Wilkes, don't you?

31:47.320 --> 31:48.856
We have mutual interests.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.903
You know I'm gonna sue him.
Wrongful death.

31:53.820 --> 31:54.775
I heard.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.783
-Hmm.
-And you'll lose.

31:59.330 --> 32:02.367
When a clinically depressed person
kills themself,

32:02.870 --> 32:05.748
there's no way to Win that case in court.

32:05.840 --> 32:07.410
I don't care.

32:08.170 --> 32:10.411
The corruption, that's what Tim
fought against his entire life,

32:10.510 --> 32:12.501
and at least now it'll be out
in the public.

32:12.590 --> 32:16.299
Charles Wilkes has the money to fight you,
and he Will fight you.

32:17.180 --> 32:20.058
He will fight you until you are bankrupt.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.766
He killed my husband. Oh, Mrs. Blake...

32:25.690 --> 32:30.980
I am so sorry,
but he didn't kill your husband.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.190
[sighs]

32:36.200 --> 32:37.485
I have a brother.

32:37.990 --> 32:42.529
He is manic-depressive,
and he has been a mess his Whole life.

32:43.040 --> 32:45.326
And I have spent much of my life
resenting him

32:45.420 --> 32:46.785
and what he put my family through.

32:46.880 --> 32:51.544
To me, he was indulgent,
and he was embarrassing,

32:51.630 --> 32:53.541
and, quite frankly, he was weak.

32:55.130 --> 32:56.131
[chuckles]

32:57.100 --> 32:59.557
And then, ten years ago,

32:59.640 --> 33:03.679
I fell into my own depression
When I lost a child.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.300
And I learned very quickly

33:06.980 --> 33:12.429
that depression
is not a passive, lethargic state.

33:13.190 --> 33:16.899
Far from it. It might seem that way
to people on the outside.

33:16.990 --> 33:22.030
But to the person depressed,
it is an active state of roiling pain

33:22.120 --> 33:25.704
from the tip of your hair
to the bottom of your feet.

33:26.830 --> 33:30.584
And I think, deep down, you know,

33:32.260 --> 33:34.251
probably more than anyone,

33:35.300 --> 33:37.757
that Charles Wilkes
didn't kill your husband.

33:38.890 --> 33:44.305
Tim killed himself
because he wanted the pain to stop.

33:44.980 --> 33:49.053
He just wanted it to end.
I mean, it feels like torture.

33:49.860 --> 33:51.396
That's Why he killed himself.

33:53.030 --> 33:56.488
And... and we want to fund a foundation
in his name

33:56.570 --> 34:00.279
to take care of the mentally ill
in Missouri,

34:00.370 --> 34:04.033
With an emphasis
for those with depression.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.070
We're prepared to start
With a million dollars.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.872
-You're trying to buy me?
-Yes, I am.

34:14.510 --> 34:19.083
I am also trying to do some good here...

34:21.350 --> 34:23.636
so that Tim's suicide isn't in vain.

34:32.400 --> 34:33.856
Just think about it.

34:35.070 --> 34:36.185
Thank you for your time.

35:01.890 --> 35:04.176
[woman] I think this is a really great
opportunity for you.

35:04.260 --> 35:07.479
You can do so much with the landscaping
and the big trees.

35:07.560 --> 35:10.097
And you're really close
to everything, so...

35:10.190 --> 35:13.682
Thank you so much for coming.
It was great to meet you.

35:14.940 --> 35:16.225
Have a great day.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.613
Yeah. Well, I've tried everything, Jacob,

35:26.700 --> 35:30.033
and, uh, it's gonna be at least a week.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.781
Yes, I understand What that means.

35:47.470 --> 35:49.097
Hey, easy, creepy.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.887
A breast is a breast is a breast.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.932
It's not my sandbox.

35:57.650 --> 35:59.527
What time is he supposed to meet you?

36:00.570 --> 36:01.605
Nine.

36:03.110 --> 36:05.772
[Petty] This is
the "Terms of Compliance" letter.

36:08.660 --> 36:11.208
Just tell him you don't understand any
of the particulars.

36:14.250 --> 36:18.584
And try to act fucking natural.
Here, these Will help.

36:20.130 --> 36:21.666
And what if he gets suspicious?

36:21.760 --> 36:25.423
This Whole charade_
was so he would come calling you,

36:25.510 --> 36:26.670
Which he did.

36:29.390 --> 36:30.926
He's not gonna be suspicious.

36:32.020 --> 36:33.931
I hate your guts. You know that?

36:34.940 --> 36:36.430
That's my cue to go.

36:41.030 --> 36:47.777
[Jacob] Can you believe he spent $10,000
on that toy hotel and paddle boat?

36:49.290 --> 36:52.908
The man thinks he can wow people
into acquiescence.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.660
So did Hitler.

36:55.750 --> 36:58.662
He held on to his power
'cause no one stood up.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.548
People ain't afraid of autocrats.

37:01.630 --> 37:03.962
People are afraid of being different
from their neighbors.

37:04.550 --> 37:10.420
I think we are actually preserving
democracy in the fine state of Missouri.

37:46.180 --> 37:47.078
Shit.

37:54.020 --> 37:56.011
[explosion] [both moaning and grunting]

38:02.190 --> 38:03.179
[Jacob] Come on!

38:05.610 --> 38:07.851
-[Jacob laughing]
-[Darlene moaning]

38:08.530 --> 38:09.656
[Jacob exhales loudly]

38:12.790 --> 38:14.781
[both breathing heavily]

38:16.660 --> 38:18.457
[both laughing]

38:18.540 --> 38:20.167
Oh, Darlene.

38:21.380 --> 38:25.874
-You are a marvel to me. You know that?
-Mmm.

38:27.300 --> 38:28.119
[Jacob sighs]

38:28.220 --> 38:31.883
-[Darlene] Oh, your heart.
-It's beating like a jackhammer.

38:31.970 --> 38:34.052
-[Darlene moans]
-[Jacob grunts]

38:34.140 --> 38:36.096
[both laughing]

38:41.110 --> 38:43.396
[Jacob grunts] Easy now. Easy.

38:44.690 --> 38:47.818
-Whoa! Don't take 'em With you.
-[both laugh]

38:48.780 --> 38:52.329
-[Jacob exhales, sighs]
-Mmm.

38:56.540 --> 38:58.861
You know what I've been thinking about?

39:00.040 --> 39:04.579
My mind is an empty shell right now.

39:07.550 --> 39:09.211
I want a baby.

39:16.850 --> 39:20.593
-Don't you think we're a little past that?
-Mnh-mnh.

39:21.190 --> 39:25.263
-Huh?
-There are millions of ways to get a baby.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.949
And I'd be a wonderful mother.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.065
[Darlene sighs]

39:39.660 --> 39:42.163
I'm serious, Jacob.

39:44.630 --> 39:49.795
What is the point of all this
if we got no one to leave it all to?

39:55.180 --> 39:56.135
Rachel?

39:57.010 --> 39:58.420
[Rachel] You're late.

40:03.400 --> 40:05.721
Oh. Turn the lights off, man.

40:06.320 --> 40:09.357
Come on.
The place is shut the fuck down anyway.

40:09.440 --> 40:10.350
You okay?

40:10.990 --> 40:12.230
Turn it off.

40:13.360 --> 40:14.270
Yeah.

40:16.950 --> 40:17.985
[Rachel] You're late.

40:18.910 --> 40:20.195
[Marty] I'm sorry about that.

40:22.830 --> 40:27.164
That's the... letters. Compliance or...

40:27.250 --> 40:30.458
-some shit. I don't really get it.
-It's a bunch of things they asked for.

40:30.550 --> 40:32.427
This should get it done.
What are you doing?

40:32.510 --> 40:33.499
What are you doing? OW! Ow!

40:33.590 --> 40:35.080
-What the fuck are you doing?
-I'm just trying to see

40:35.180 --> 40:38.092
if Marty Byrde has some feelings.
That's all I'm trying to do.

40:38.180 --> 40:40.307
Ah, why don't we pick up
this conversation tomorrow?

40:40.390 --> 40:42.346
-Oh, shit.
-[Marty] Jesus.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.056
You all right? Hey. What's wrong with
you? I mean, you wrecked my fucking life,
but I'm okay.

40:48.270 --> 40:51.068
[Marty] I wrecked your life?
All right, |ook.Come here. Come here.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.525
Let's get you to bed.

40:53.610 --> 40:55.862
Sleep this off a little bit, okay?

40:55.950 --> 40:57.065
-Come on.
-Okay.

40:57.160 --> 40:59.481
-[Marty] Come on.
-You do not get to see me naked.

40:59.580 --> 41:00.899
You had your chance.

41:01.500 --> 41:04.116
-I'm fine. _
-[Marty] You're not fine.

41:04.210 --> 41:06.030
One foot in front of the other.

41:06.630 --> 41:09.246
-[Rachel] All right.
-I'll set you down. Come here.

41:09.340 --> 41:11.296
Come here. Right here.

41:11.380 --> 41:13.166
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

41:13.260 --> 41:15.171
-[Marty] Okay, all right?
-Okay.

41:15.260 --> 41:16.466
[Marty] Right there.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.460
-Thank you.
-Let go. Yeah.

41:18.550 --> 41:20.211
-Thank you.
-You all right?

41:24.560 --> 41:25.379
[Marty sighs] Yeah.

41:29.060 --> 41:30.891
You sleep this off.

41:31.480 --> 41:34.984
And you'll be back to normal, okay?

41:36.660 --> 41:37.945
All right.

41:38.030 --> 41:39.770
-Marty.
-Yep.

41:41.950 --> 41:43.247
They're gonna find you.

41:43.830 --> 41:44.649
Hmm?

41:44.750 --> 41:48.493
They're gonna lock you up.
Or they're gonna kill you.

42:37.550 --> 42:39.541
[engine rewing] [line ringing]

43:14.800 --> 43:17.667
Hello.
-What the fuck are you doing, Ruthie?

43:17.760 --> 43:20.797
I got $50,000 worth of damage here
on my dock!

43:20.880 --> 43:23.849
I have not the slightest idea
what you ’re talking about

43:23.930 --> 43:28.424
I was actually gonna call you to follow up
on our conversation from two days ago.

43:29.390 --> 43:30.550
Is now a good time?

43:31.150 --> 43:32.515
I ought to kick your ass.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.510
Your insurer will likely see

43:34.610 --> 43:37.738
that the damage was not caused
by an act of God,

43:37.820 --> 43:39.230
but a large boat.

43:39.820 --> 43:41.651
And if he's a suspicious type...

43:41.740 --> 43:43.776
You know those insurance fuckers.

43:43.870 --> 43:48.159
He might even think that it was caused
by a $300,000 wake boat.

43:49.540 --> 43:53.283
No payout coming from Allstate,
if you know What I mean.

43:53.790 --> 43:58.580
So, one option is to declare bankruptcy,
of course,

43:58.670 --> 44:02.549
and the other is to take
What I offered you two days ago.

44:02.640 --> 44:06.804
Marty Byrde Enterprises
Will replace all these boats out front

44:06.890 --> 44:08.926
before the owners know a thing.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.556
You're worse than your dad.

44:12.690 --> 44:14.476
We'll get you your brealoNater.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.851
[Susan]
Most of you knew 77m.

44:21.950 --> 44:25.943
When he believed in something,
nothing could dissuade him.

44:26.030 --> 44:29.238
-He was a bulldog with a bone. [chuckles]
-[congregation laughs]

44:30.540 --> 44:34.658
He loved being a senator,
serving his constituents.

44:36.130 --> 44:42.217
And he believed that systemic corruption
was destroying the thing he loved.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.539
What some of you may not know

44:46.640 --> 44:51.805
is that Tim also suffered...
from clinical depressmn.

44:53.940 --> 44:56.181
He was hospitalized several times.

44:56.900 --> 45:01.485
He didn't tell people, because he didn't
want to be defined by his condition.

45:02.530 --> 45:05.101
Now the reason I am telling you all this

45:05.200 --> 45:07.612
is because I have an announcement
to make today,

45:07.700 --> 45:09.531
and I think Tim would approve.

45:13.540 --> 45:16.122
We are starting the Tim Blake Foundation

45:16.210 --> 45:19.998
for the mentally ill
With a substantial endowment.

45:21.760 --> 45:23.546
As Father Bill says,

45:25.380 --> 45:29.635
"Though he were dead, yet shall he live."

45:33.680 --> 45:34.886
[ Wendy]
You owe me.

45:34.980 --> 45:36.299
Yeah, I owe you.

45:37.060 --> 45:39.642
You wouldn't know anything
about my boat being blown up, would you?

45:39.730 --> 45:42.358
About as much as you know
about my businesses being shut down.

45:43.280 --> 45:46.818
So, listen. I'm the one
Who convinced Mrs. Blake not to sue.

45:48.490 --> 45:50.617
-The foundation? That was your idea?
-Mm-hmm.

45:50.700 --> 45:53.942
We told her we'd donate a million.
You're gonna pony up half.

45:54.040 --> 45:54.995
I am, am I?

45:55.500 --> 45:59.163
Unless you want to be sued for a lot more.
Dragged through the mud.

46:00.500 --> 46:02.877
Listen, the Snells are a no-go, but...

46:03.760 --> 46:06.718
we have 3% of the profit.
We're Willing to give you 1.5%.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.540
-Oh.
-It's the best we can do.

46:08.640 --> 46:11.006
You're a very persuasive woman,
Wendy Byrde.

46:11.760 --> 46:12.966
What about my boat?

46:13.560 --> 46:15.175
That's Why you have insurance.

46:16.270 --> 46:19.728
Hey, for the record,
I didn't close down your businesses.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.568
Someone's got you in their crosshairs.

46:23.190 --> 46:24.600
The commission's gonna come at you hard,

46:24.690 --> 46:26.521
and I hope you have
everything buttoned up.

46:27.990 --> 46:29.981
That's What we're working on now.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.361
-We own a dry storage business.
-Um, good. I need to talk to you.

46:39.460 --> 46:42.452
Or at least we're investors
in a dry storage busmess.

46:42.540 --> 46:44.121
All we just need is new hydraulics

46:44.210 --> 46:45.916
-and a shit-ton of clock repair.
-Can you hold on for one second?

46:46.010 --> 46:47.295
-And I figure we can make up...
-Let me...

46:47.380 --> 46:49.462
-Hey, Ruth.
-...for most of the laundering we've
lost, with the businesses shut down,
just on repairs alone.

46:51.720 --> 46:53.551
Just stop for a second, okay?

46:53.640 --> 46:56.473
-Do you hear what I'm fucking saying?
-It's impossible not to.

46:56.560 --> 46:58.437
I got us a brand-new business

46:58.520 --> 47:00.397
-to launder through.
-Great!

47:00.980 --> 47:02.550
What the fuck is going on?

47:03.150 --> 47:06.779
We can't have you around the offices
for a little While, okay?

47:09.450 --> 47:11.156
Are you fucking firing me?

47:11.240 --> 47:14.573
No, I am not. The gaming commission
is launching, uh, an investigation.

47:14.660 --> 47:17.823
We can't have a convicted felon
on any paperwork. That's all.

47:17.910 --> 47:19.662
You're fucking firing me.

47:19.750 --> 47:21.661
_ Just in name. _
You're still gonna manage the strip club.

47:21.750 --> 47:23.081
You're still gonna get paid. We just...

47:23.170 --> 47:25.582
We need to have somebody else
be the face of the place.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.664
Okay?

47:28.590 --> 47:30.080
-I get it.
-Good.

47:38.390 --> 47:40.017
[Rachel]
Why are you yelling at me?

47:40.100 --> 47:42.182
Because he could've found the Wire.

47:42.270 --> 47:43.180
He didn't.

47:43.690 --> 47:45.260
How the fuck do you know?

47:48.820 --> 47:52.563
-Hey, look, I am not cut out for this.
-I don't care.

47:56.370 --> 47:58.577
It just makes me hate myself so much.

48:11.430 --> 48:13.216
Do better than you've been doing.

48:22.100 --> 48:23.977
[Jacob] Here's to our working partnership.

48:24.480 --> 48:26.857
-[Marty] Yeah. Sure. Cheers.
-[clinking]

48:26.940 --> 48:30.182
Absolutely, and to us
being up and running again.

48:33.660 --> 48:35.560
We appreciate you understanding

48:35.660 --> 48:38.902
that sometimes diplomacy has
to take a back seat to action.

48:39.910 --> 48:42.652
Well, maybe there was
a little diplomacy, too.

48:43.290 --> 48:46.339
The point is,
the man shut down your businesses.

48:46.840 --> 48:49.491
And now he knows the cost
of stepping out of line.

48:49.590 --> 48:50.659
Ain't that right?

48:51.260 --> 48:52.966
Charles Wilkes won't be a problem again.

48:54.340 --> 48:58.253
You know, I thought you'd be a real cunt.

48:59.220 --> 49:00.551
I was wrong.

49:01.390 --> 49:02.300
[chuckles]

49:05.190 --> 49:09.968
[chuckles] Well, thank you.
Thank you. This is delicious.

49:10.690 --> 49:13.773
Don't thank us. Thank your boy.
He shot it.

49:23.370 --> 49:24.325
[Ruth] Wyatt.

49:27.750 --> 49:33.211
"You ask why I belong at Mizzou.
The simple answer is I don't."

49:33.300 --> 49:35.461
-[Wyatt and Three chuckle]
-[Three] Dude, you really wrote that?

49:38.760 --> 49:42.014
"An undercurrent of savagery
pervaded my life

49:42.100 --> 49:44.261
long before the violence truly began.

49:44.350 --> 49:49.014
My dad made grand theft auto
seem like a good career path,

49:49.610 --> 49:53.023
like we were entrepreneurs in a start-up.

49:53.110 --> 49:57.399
Only our start-up
was the motor of someone else's car

49:57.490 --> 49:59.276
or truck or boat."

50:01.660 --> 50:03.321
You shouldn't be saying this, Wyatt.

50:03.410 --> 50:05.037
Keep reading. It gets better.

50:07.710 --> 50:10.918
"My childhood traumas are not like yours.

50:12.460 --> 50:16.544
My mother's leaving
is not like your mother's leaving.

50:17.970 --> 50:22.054
You see, I'm a cursed Langmore,

50:22.640 --> 50:26.724
long inured to violence and death.

50:26.810 --> 50:31.645
'Taken too soon?‘
people ask me of an untimely death.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.932
And in the case of a Langmore,

50:37.320 --> 50:39.561
perhaps not soon enough."

50:40.410 --> 50:42.025
[breathes deeply]

50:42.120 --> 50:44.361
You shouldn't be saying this shit, Wyatt.

50:44.450 --> 50:47.578
It sounds like you're ready
to off yourself,

50:47.660 --> 50:49.491
not get into college.

50:49.580 --> 50:51.707
I wrote the essay. I don't know
What else you want me to do.

50:51.790 --> 50:53.838
You're not fucking cursed, Wyatt.

51:02.390 --> 51:03.379
[slams door]

51:04.770 --> 51:06.761
[bobcats meowing]

51:28.080 --> 51:30.492
You believe in the Langmore curse?

51:31.630 --> 51:34.952
Walking the same fucking path
you always walked,

51:35.050 --> 51:37.701
'cause nothing's gonna change aanay.

51:39.590 --> 51:42.969
Are you losing your shit, baby girl? Hmm?

51:50.690 --> 51:55.468
To Hurn's, the dry dock
Russ and Boyd used to work at.

51:56.230 --> 52:00.564
You can make a job for yourself there.
Look all busy when your PO stops by.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.849
Look, I don't want to know
nothing about it.

52:02.950 --> 52:05.362
It ain't my business,
but, you know, after dark,

52:05.450 --> 52:10.205
if someone wanted to chop boats for parts,

52:10.290 --> 52:12.497
you could probably
make a fair amount of coin.

52:13.380 --> 52:15.587
I thought you didn't approve
of that shit no more.

52:18.420 --> 52:20.126
You want the keys or not?

52:50.870 --> 52:52.906
