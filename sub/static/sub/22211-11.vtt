WEBVTT

00:00.002 --> 00:01.837
Previously on Legends of Tomorrow...

00:01.838 --> 00:03.030
Sara may not know it,

00:03.031 --> 00:05.140
but the demon's power
that lives inside of her,

00:05.141 --> 00:07.531
when she succumbs to it,
you're gonna need that gun.

00:07.532 --> 00:08.417
Come with us.

00:08.418 --> 00:09.578
What would you rather do?

00:09.579 --> 00:12.123
Hide from A.R.G.U.S. your
whole life or time travel?

00:12.124 --> 00:14.682
What do you think the captain would
think about you re-engineering time?

00:14.683 --> 00:16.761
Well, I'm no hero,

00:16.762 --> 00:18.898
and I'm not a member of any team.

00:20.559 --> 00:22.059
Are you sure about this, Ms. Tomaz?

00:22.060 --> 00:23.436
Captain Lance did not give you

00:23.437 --> 00:25.204
authorization to initialize this program.

00:25.205 --> 00:26.505
That's because I didn't
ask for authorization.

00:26.506 --> 00:28.141
Now fire up the auxiliary generator.

00:28.142 --> 00:29.976
Even with the reserve
power, I don't believe

00:29.977 --> 00:32.177
my system can run your
simulation software.

00:32.179 --> 00:33.613
Gideon, trust me.

00:33.614 --> 00:34.914
Trust is something that grows

00:34.915 --> 00:36.582
over time between friends.

00:36.583 --> 00:37.783
As far as I'm concerned,

00:37.784 --> 00:39.853
we are still acquaintances.

00:39.854 --> 00:41.220
Question, Gideon.

00:41.221 --> 00:43.089
Who's ready to have 1.12 terawatts

00:43.090 --> 00:45.536
of power diverted straight into her CPU?

00:45.537 --> 00:47.004
I'm not sure if your calculations

00:47.005 --> 00:48.484
accurately stabilize the surge.

00:48.485 --> 00:49.852
We should talk about
this before proceeding.

00:49.853 --> 00:50.832
No time.

00:50.833 --> 00:52.989
We have to run this program
before the team gets back.

00:52.990 --> 00:54.523
In that case, I suggest you hurry.

00:54.524 --> 00:57.226
The team has just returned on
the jumpship from their mission.

00:57.227 --> 00:59.297
Okay. Screw it.

00:59.699 --> 01:01.333
Gideon, what's happening?

01:01.334 --> 01:03.469
I was gonna ask the same question.

01:03.470 --> 01:04.837
I thought you were fixing the ship.

01:05.355 --> 01:06.539
Yeah, that... the maintenance check

01:06.540 --> 01:09.275
took longer than expected.
The ship's a mess.

01:09.276 --> 01:11.344
I had to re-initialize
Gideon's alpha drives.

01:11.345 --> 01:13.446
So how'd it go out there? Good mish?

01:14.153 --> 01:16.449
I pried this cassette
from Shorty's fingers.

01:16.450 --> 01:18.884
- He means Napoleon Bonaparte.
- "Waterloo."

01:18.885 --> 01:21.521
Who writes a song about losing a war?

01:24.723 --> 01:25.758
Anyway.

01:25.759 --> 01:27.193
It was really great.

01:27.194 --> 01:29.095
Even though half our band

01:29.096 --> 01:31.063
missed the cue for our big encore.

01:31.064 --> 01:32.231
Yeah, where were you guys?

01:34.300 --> 01:36.001
It was my fault.

01:36.002 --> 01:39.372
I was just not used to walking
in these go-go boots.

01:40.254 --> 01:42.208
It won't happen again, Captain.

01:42.209 --> 01:45.477
Right. Gideon, let's check
the historical records,

01:45.478 --> 01:46.979
see if everything is back to normal.

01:46.980 --> 01:48.680
According to the historical record,

01:48.681 --> 01:50.549
the battle of Waterloo is back on track.

01:50.550 --> 01:52.251
Napoleon did surrender...

01:52.252 --> 01:54.488
And the French forces withdrew...

01:55.288 --> 01:58.057
Gideon? Where did she go?

01:58.058 --> 02:00.226
The ship's functions
are still operational,

02:00.227 --> 02:03.562
but it looks as though Gideon's
neural core has been fried.

02:03.563 --> 02:07.199
I asked you to perform a
routine maintenance check.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.133
I did run a maintenance check.

02:09.134 --> 02:11.603
And maybe something else?

02:11.604 --> 02:13.572
Something you want to tell us about?

02:13.573 --> 02:16.141
Maybe show us?

02:16.142 --> 02:18.110
Oh, do not make me move you.

02:18.111 --> 02:20.612
You should just
tell her what it is.

02:20.613 --> 02:23.183
Last thing we want to do is get Sara mad.

02:24.150 --> 02:25.484
Why is that?

02:25.485 --> 02:27.420
Because...

02:27.421 --> 02:29.889
High blood pressure. It
takes years off your life.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.824
Okay, fine. You win.

02:31.825 --> 02:33.693
I uploaded a synchronous, multi-model

02:33.694 --> 02:36.128
simulation program to
Gideon's neural core.

02:36.129 --> 02:38.631
A simulation program for what?

02:38.632 --> 02:41.067
To see if there are any
other loopholes in history

02:41.068 --> 02:42.334
that we could exploit.

02:42.335 --> 02:43.969
We?

02:43.970 --> 02:46.004
You mean you can exploit.

02:46.005 --> 02:48.173
You're trying to hack history?

02:48.174 --> 02:50.943
What exactly are you
trying to change in 2042?

02:50.944 --> 02:52.211
Oh, I don't know, Ray.

02:52.212 --> 02:54.547
Maybe I'm trying to figure
out how to stop my home

02:54.548 --> 02:56.282
from becoming a dystopian nightmare?

02:56.283 --> 02:58.384
Look, Zari, I let the
Helen of Troy thing pass.

02:58.385 --> 02:59.818
I even let it slide

02:59.819 --> 03:01.420
when you tried to prevent Martin's death,

03:01.421 --> 03:03.122
but you need to understand

03:03.123 --> 03:05.757
we are in the "fixing
anachronisms" business,

03:05.758 --> 03:07.492
not the "hacking history" business.

03:07.493 --> 03:09.328
Now please go fix Gideon.

03:09.329 --> 03:11.964
Hey, maybe if you would stop
bossing me around for a second,

03:11.965 --> 03:13.532
you would see this is a good idea.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.034
I said "please."

03:15.035 --> 03:16.669
And even if I didn't,

03:16.670 --> 03:19.572
bossing you around is part
of my job as captain.

03:19.573 --> 03:20.873
Yeah, and it's really easy

03:20.874 --> 03:23.576
to take you seriously in that outfit.

03:23.577 --> 03:26.611
You know this whole
apathetic cool girl thing,

03:26.612 --> 03:28.947
it's not as cute as you think.

03:28.948 --> 03:30.983
If you want to be a
member of this team...

03:30.984 --> 03:32.417
Member-ish.

03:32.418 --> 03:34.353
This was always a temporary arrangement.

03:34.354 --> 03:36.389
I was never planning on
sticking around for long.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.691
Then so long as you are on this ship,

03:38.692 --> 03:40.726
I am your captain, and
if you don't like it,

03:40.727 --> 03:42.561
you can stop sticking around.

03:43.367 --> 03:44.765
Aye, aye.

03:46.032 --> 03:47.766
- I'm gonna kill her.
- Wait!

03:47.767 --> 03:48.936
Sara... no!

03:52.405 --> 03:54.074
Just fix the ship.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.679
"Just fix the ship." Yes, Captain.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.913
Of course, Captain.

04:00.914 --> 04:03.217
Could I kiss your ass, Captain?

04:09.489 --> 04:11.358
Damn it.

04:13.593 --> 04:15.329
Of course. Of course!

04:20.367 --> 04:23.203
All right, Gideon. You back online?

04:24.437 --> 04:26.740
Gideon?

04:31.077 --> 04:32.745
Holy...

04:39.987 --> 04:42.454
Well, as long as you are on this ship,

04:42.455 --> 04:44.456
I'm your captain, and
if you don't like it,

04:44.457 --> 04:47.094
you can stop sticking around.

04:49.596 --> 04:51.431
Are you gonna say something?

04:52.231 --> 04:54.133
Yeah.

04:54.602 --> 04:55.402
What the...

04:55.602 --> 05:00.552
www.TUSUBTITULO.com
-DIFUNDE LA CULTURA-

05:01.919 --> 05:04.109
What is wrong with you?

05:05.514 --> 05:06.612
Nothing, I think.

05:06.613 --> 05:08.714
Didn't we just have this conversation?

05:08.715 --> 05:10.916
Yeah, 'cause you keep
making me repeat myself.

05:10.917 --> 05:13.753
No. That's not what I meant.

05:13.754 --> 05:15.722
Sara, don't get mad. I'm
sure Zari could fix...

05:17.991 --> 05:19.693
Just fix the ship.

05:21.161 --> 05:22.662
Yeah, okay. Sure.

05:29.169 --> 05:30.803
Deep breaths.

05:30.804 --> 05:32.772
No one's going crazy.

05:32.773 --> 05:34.641
It's probably just something I ate.

05:39.437 --> 05:41.414
- I'm busy.
- Right.

05:41.415 --> 05:43.715
You've done a lot of time travelling.

05:43.716 --> 05:45.250
Have you ever had déjà vu?

05:45.251 --> 05:46.685
What's that?

05:46.686 --> 05:48.787
Oh, it's... French for already seen.

05:48.788 --> 05:50.424
I hate the French!

05:53.526 --> 05:55.460
I'm mortified, Nathaniel.

05:55.461 --> 05:57.295
I mean, we could've permanently
derailed the history of France.

05:57.296 --> 05:58.663
- For what?
- For what?

05:58.664 --> 06:00.499
Have you not seen your outfit?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.268
It totally would have been
worth it, and I'm a historian!

06:02.269 --> 06:04.002
We never should've given
into the temptation.

06:04.003 --> 06:06.505
But we did.

06:06.506 --> 06:08.508
And now, I can't stop thinking about you.

06:09.976 --> 06:12.978
We can't put the team at risk. All right?

06:12.979 --> 06:16.682
Until we can figure out a way
to behave professionally,

06:16.683 --> 06:19.284
we'll have to forget it ever happened.

06:19.285 --> 06:20.453
I can't.

06:23.523 --> 06:25.291
Just try.

06:33.466 --> 06:35.000
Nate.

06:35.001 --> 06:36.802
Yeah... Amaya and I
were just comparing notes

06:36.803 --> 06:38.604
on the last mission.

06:38.605 --> 06:41.840
Did you notice anything weird
happen a few minutes ago?

06:41.841 --> 06:43.542
No, not really.

06:43.543 --> 06:45.544
Nothing with the ship?

06:45.545 --> 06:48.314
Well, let me think about it.

06:51.218 --> 06:52.218
Nope.

06:52.219 --> 06:53.886
Nothing out of the ordinary.

06:53.887 --> 06:55.387
Hey, aren't you supposed
to be in the engine room?

06:55.388 --> 06:57.289
Sara told you to fix Gideon.

06:57.290 --> 06:58.724
The last thing we want to do is...

06:58.725 --> 07:00.392
Make Sara mad.

07:00.393 --> 07:02.027
Yeah. You know what they say.

07:02.028 --> 07:04.196
"Happy captain, happy ship."

07:04.197 --> 07:06.399
No one says that, but whatever.

07:08.000 --> 07:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:15.441 --> 07:17.642
"Happy captain, happy ship!"

07:17.643 --> 07:19.445
Stupid.

07:36.095 --> 07:37.998
All right, Gideon. You there?

07:40.867 --> 07:42.234
Mamma mia.

07:42.235 --> 07:44.137
Here I go again.

07:50.787 --> 07:52.786
So long as you are on this ship,

07:52.787 --> 07:53.854
I'm your captain.

07:53.855 --> 07:54.988
And if you don't like it,

07:54.989 --> 07:56.590
you can stop sticking around.

07:56.591 --> 07:58.459
Okay, something really
bizarre is happening.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.793
You're not even listening to me.

07:59.794 --> 08:01.695
No, Sara, wait!

08:01.696 --> 08:02.783
There's no need for violence!

08:03.698 --> 08:06.166
I'm sorry, old habits.

08:06.167 --> 08:08.270
Ray, take Zari to the MedBay.

08:10.472 --> 08:11.672
This way.

08:11.673 --> 08:13.142
What has gotten into you?

08:15.377 --> 08:17.010
I don't know how to explain this,

08:17.011 --> 08:19.147
but I've died twice.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.484
Have you gotten into Nate's
psychedelic root stash?

08:23.485 --> 08:25.619
No, I'm serious, Ray,
please, I need your help.

08:28.923 --> 08:30.357
Fine, whatever.

08:30.358 --> 08:32.359
I guess I have to figure
this out on my own.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.727
- What's that?
- It's a mild sedative.

08:34.729 --> 08:35.929
While you heal up,

08:35.929 --> 08:37.298
I don't want you hurting yourself,

08:37.299 --> 08:38.467
or anybody else.

08:39.467 --> 08:41.470
Ray!

08:43.671 --> 08:45.406
So long as you are on this ship...

08:45.407 --> 08:47.308
- Sara, I need you to shut up.
- What?

08:47.309 --> 08:48.809
Emergency! Everyone back
on the bridge, right now.

08:48.810 --> 08:50.110
What are you doing?

08:50.111 --> 08:51.779
Okay, let's all just calm down.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.914
No, I will not calm down,
and watch your step, Ray.

08:53.915 --> 08:55.682
What do you mean?

08:55.683 --> 08:57.151
I thought the mission was over.

08:57.152 --> 08:58.986
- Why are we still here?
- Yeah, what's going on?

08:58.987 --> 09:01.255
Okay, I know... I know
this is gonna sound crazy,

09:01.256 --> 09:04.858
but we are all in imminent danger.

09:04.859 --> 09:07.628
In an hour, this ship
is going to explode.

09:07.629 --> 09:08.964
How do you know?

09:10.298 --> 09:12.266
Let's... let's... let's
say I had a dream.

09:12.821 --> 09:14.368
But we need to check the ship,

09:14.369 --> 09:15.736
and go over every inch,

09:15.737 --> 09:17.305
because if we don't stop this explosion,

09:17.306 --> 09:18.907
we're going to die!

09:22.844 --> 09:23.778
Yeah.

09:28.516 --> 09:30.150
Guys!

09:30.151 --> 09:33.087
Guys, I'm telling the truth!

09:33.088 --> 09:36.189
What's up with her?

09:36.190 --> 09:38.827
Working theory: cabin fever.

09:40.027 --> 09:43.065
Working theory: space madness.

09:43.898 --> 09:46.133
Acute entropic dementia.

09:46.134 --> 09:47.535
Too many donuts.

09:49.203 --> 09:51.239
I mean, it could be anything.

09:56.811 --> 09:59.080
Must've developed
a sedative tolerance.

10:07.022 --> 10:09.022
What's the plan, Z?

10:09.023 --> 10:10.424
First, you piss off Sara,

10:10.425 --> 10:11.692
now you're sneaking out of the MedBay.

10:11.693 --> 10:13.293
Yeah, I don't have a plan,

10:13.294 --> 10:15.629
because nothing I do matters anyway.

10:15.630 --> 10:18.465
Sara always yells at me,
nobody believes what I say,

10:18.466 --> 10:20.202
and Ray always trips on his platforms.

10:22.003 --> 10:23.938
I have no idea why I'm
stuck in this time loop.

10:23.939 --> 10:27.007
Time loop, you mean
like "Groundhog Day?"

10:27.008 --> 10:28.742
You don't know "Groundhog"...

10:28.743 --> 10:30.478
All right, it's a movie about this guy

10:30.479 --> 10:32.913
who lives the same day over
and over and over again

10:32.914 --> 10:34.314
until he learns to be a better person.

10:34.315 --> 10:35.616
I know it sounds totally hacky.

10:35.617 --> 10:37.252
However, it's very well executed.

10:38.953 --> 10:40.654
What's that noise?

10:40.655 --> 10:43.023
Oh, that noise just means
that we're all about to die.

10:43.024 --> 10:46.593
All right, if what
you're saying is true,

10:46.594 --> 10:48.495
and you find yourself in the loop again,

10:48.496 --> 10:52.800
find me, and say the
words "Groundhog Day."

10:52.801 --> 10:54.002
Just do it!

10:56.571 --> 10:58.638
Well, as long as you are on
this ship, I'm your captain,

10:58.639 --> 11:00.241
and if you don't like it,

11:00.242 --> 11:01.742
- you can stop sticking...
- Stop sticking around.

11:01.743 --> 11:02.911
- Yeah.
- Around.

11:06.547 --> 11:07.948
Oh, and watch out, Ray.

11:07.949 --> 11:09.049
Watch out for...

11:09.050 --> 11:11.219
What?

11:12.821 --> 11:14.422
How did she know that?

11:14.423 --> 11:16.123
Nate... Nate...

11:16.124 --> 11:17.858
Library.

11:17.859 --> 11:20.894
We can't put the rest of
the team at risk, all right?

11:20.895 --> 11:23.163
Until we can figure out a way
to behave professionally,

11:23.164 --> 11:26.066
we just have to forget
that this ever happened.

11:26.067 --> 11:28.270
- I can't.
- Just try.

11:35.435 --> 11:36.443
Nate.

11:36.444 --> 11:38.479
Amaya and I were just, you
know, working on our harmonies,

11:38.480 --> 11:39.613
in case we have to impersonate...

11:39.614 --> 11:40.747
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

11:40.748 --> 11:43.451
I have something to tell you.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.320
Hedgehog Day!

11:47.022 --> 11:49.123
Damn it, you told me if
I said "Hedgehog Day"

11:49.124 --> 11:51.058
you would know what I was talking about.

11:51.059 --> 11:53.828
Do you mean "Groundhog Day"?

11:53.829 --> 11:55.796
Why would I tell you to tell
me about a Bill Murray movie?

11:55.797 --> 11:57.131
I don't know, all I know is

11:57.132 --> 11:58.565
I'm stuck in this time loop.

11:58.566 --> 12:02.002
Like "Groundhog Day"!
Okay, got it, okay.

12:02.003 --> 12:03.338
You do?

12:05.173 --> 12:06.874
And you'll help me figure
out what's going on?

12:06.875 --> 12:07.975
Yeah, that's what friends are for.

12:07.976 --> 12:09.977
- We're friends?
- Of course!

12:09.978 --> 12:11.712
So lay it on me. What's
happening? All right.

12:11.713 --> 12:14.114
How about instead of trying to
stop the ship from exploding,

12:14.115 --> 12:15.382
we all get on the jumpship and escape?

12:15.383 --> 12:16.817
Yeah, while you guys were out,

12:16.818 --> 12:18.252
I was running my own little side mission,

12:18.253 --> 12:19.820
which crashed Gideon, and with her down,

12:19.821 --> 12:21.254
the jumpship's locked
into the docking bay.

12:21.255 --> 12:22.756
So we need to talk to Sara.

12:22.757 --> 12:24.224
No, I already tried.
She never listens to me.

12:24.225 --> 12:26.526
Probably too pissed off.

12:26.527 --> 12:29.864
You know, thinking about the
vibration pattern of the blast,

12:29.865 --> 12:31.999
I don't think we were
attacked from the outside.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.903
The explosion was caused
by someone on the ship.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.405
I seriously doubt anybody would blow up

12:38.406 --> 12:40.307
the ship on purpose.
So where do we start?

12:40.308 --> 12:42.108
I mean, you've all been
acting a little suspicious

12:42.109 --> 12:43.376
since you got back from your mission.

12:46.514 --> 12:48.448
Mick doing laundry.

12:48.449 --> 12:49.617
Now, that's suspicious.

12:49.618 --> 12:51.085
Yeah. Very.

12:55.642 --> 12:56.323
Go.

12:56.324 --> 12:58.525
I can't get this damn
song out of my head.

12:58.526 --> 13:00.160
Which one? "Waterloo"?

13:01.693 --> 13:03.765
Don't mention it!

13:07.802 --> 13:09.603
- Did it work?
- Did what work?

13:09.604 --> 13:11.572
Why am I holding the thingy in my hand?

13:11.573 --> 13:13.374
I'll look after it, Mick.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.342
Okay. Good!

13:15.343 --> 13:17.077
I gotta get my undies in the dryer

13:17.078 --> 13:18.580
before Haircut does!

13:26.154 --> 13:27.754
Why would Amaya want
the memory flasher?

13:27.755 --> 13:29.222
It could have something
to do with Kuasa.

13:29.223 --> 13:30.557
She does want to help her.

13:30.558 --> 13:32.926
What if Kuasa somehow convinced her

13:32.927 --> 13:34.194
to blow up the ship?

13:34.195 --> 13:36.896
Take it easy on the conspiracy juice.

13:36.897 --> 13:39.033
- I'll find out what's going on.
- All right.

13:42.570 --> 13:43.971
Hey!

13:43.972 --> 13:46.740
I... I thought Sara told
you to fix the ship.

13:46.741 --> 13:48.475
Yeah, like she always does.

13:48.476 --> 13:50.610
Yeah, look, I know Sara can be tough,

13:50.611 --> 13:52.746
especially when you make her mad.

13:52.747 --> 13:55.282
Hey, why are you so worried
about Sara's temper?

13:55.283 --> 13:57.952
No, I just... you know the saying.

13:57.953 --> 13:59.353
Happy Captain...

13:59.354 --> 14:00.921
- Happy ship.
- Happy ship. Yeah.

14:00.922 --> 14:03.290
Well, I guess... I guess my catchphrase

14:03.291 --> 14:05.292
is catching on in the future.

14:05.293 --> 14:09.429
Yeah, yeah... everyone
is saying it where I'm from.

14:11.239 --> 14:12.265
That's cool.

14:12.266 --> 14:14.167
Come on, Nate, we're
running out of time.

14:14.168 --> 14:15.536
What are you doing in there?

14:17.372 --> 14:19.940
The truth is, when it comes to you,

14:19.941 --> 14:22.176
I'm not as strong as I'd like to be.

14:22.177 --> 14:25.245
With this, we can both
forget it happened.

14:25.246 --> 14:26.746
Yeah, you're right.

14:26.747 --> 14:29.682
With everything going
on with Mallus, Kuasa,

14:29.683 --> 14:31.585
and Zari mentioned
something about the ship,

14:31.586 --> 14:32.520
we should be clear-headed.

14:32.521 --> 14:33.888
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:36.658 --> 14:42.195
But, since we're gonna
flash ourselves anyway...

14:42.196 --> 14:45.432
I mean, it's not like we'd remember.

14:46.818 --> 14:47.935
Nate.

14:51.172 --> 14:53.041
Thank God.

14:55.010 --> 14:56.378
Come here, Tiger.

15:03.618 --> 15:04.752
Kill me now.

15:09.787 --> 15:11.220
Nate!

15:11.221 --> 15:12.656
Oh, hey... Amaya and I were just...

15:12.657 --> 15:14.190
"Groundhog Day!" One
hour, ship explodes!

15:14.191 --> 15:15.658
You're stuck in a time loop,

15:15.659 --> 15:16.927
and we have to stop the
ship from exploding?

15:16.928 --> 15:18.467
Exactly, and I think that someone...

15:18.468 --> 15:20.170
- Is triggering the explosion.
- It's probably an accident,

15:20.171 --> 15:21.304
but we have to investigate everyone

15:21.305 --> 15:22.166
to figure out who's causing it.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.664
There's a lot of secrets on this ship.

15:23.665 --> 15:25.975
- Let's start with Amaya.
- Why? So you can sex with her?

15:25.976 --> 15:26.816
- That's crazy.
- No.

15:26.817 --> 15:28.750
You two flashing each other
afterwards in order to forget,

15:28.751 --> 15:29.463
that's crazy!

15:29.464 --> 15:30.832
Why would we flash each
other after having sex?

15:30.833 --> 15:33.226
- Focus, Nate!
- Right, ship exploding.

15:33.227 --> 15:35.095
- Got it.
- Let's go find Rory.

15:35.096 --> 15:37.665
Right, she probably wants
to forget how awesome it was.

15:37.666 --> 15:39.132
Or how short.

15:39.133 --> 15:41.235
So I've timed out a schedule.

15:41.236 --> 15:45.340
He always leaves right about now.

15:46.708 --> 15:48.242
Here.

15:55.383 --> 15:56.551
Come on.

16:01.631 --> 16:03.023
Suspicious looking box!

16:03.024 --> 16:04.391
Careful, for all we know,

16:04.392 --> 16:05.759
it could be the cause of the explosion.

16:05.760 --> 16:08.430
We just gotta take it nice and...

16:10.064 --> 16:11.198
Oh, my God!

16:11.199 --> 16:12.232
Oh, my God!

16:12.233 --> 16:13.669
Oh, my God!

16:17.482 --> 16:19.540
Oh, nice save.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.708
Can you imagine if I tripped that?

16:21.709 --> 16:23.644
Yeah, I don't have to imagine it.

16:23.645 --> 16:26.014
Oh, God. Okay.

16:27.215 --> 16:28.349
Here we go.

16:33.154 --> 16:34.323
Damn it!

16:38.125 --> 16:39.827
So you got all the traps?

16:39.828 --> 16:42.529
I don't know. I've never
gotten this far before.

16:42.530 --> 16:44.666
Okay.

16:54.042 --> 16:59.080
Why would Mick rig all these
traps for a damn typewriter?

16:59.081 --> 17:02.082
Maybe it's his criminal manifesto.

17:02.083 --> 17:04.718
Let me see this.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.855
This says "bosom" far too
many times to be a manifesto.

17:07.856 --> 17:11.858
"As the twin suns of
Dartayus set on the horizon,

17:11.858 --> 17:14.493
"her heaving bosom undulated

17:14.494 --> 17:16.997
"like the soothing waves of the bay.

17:16.998 --> 17:20.500
Buck swept her into his musky embrace."

17:20.501 --> 17:22.903
Mick's writing a sci-fi romance novel.

17:22.904 --> 17:24.805
Yeah.

17:24.806 --> 17:27.041
Well, that's the last thing I
thought I'd see before I die.

17:28.409 --> 17:30.478
Oh, funny you should say that.

17:32.581 --> 17:35.382
So you're saying Rory and
Amaya are in the clear.

17:35.383 --> 17:36.650
Which is why we're gonna go visit Ray.

17:36.651 --> 17:38.051
He's been acting twitchy.

17:38.052 --> 17:40.588
Well, let's go spy on my best friend!

17:43.791 --> 17:45.459
Oh, wow, that's boring.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.561
I think we can cross him
off our suspect list.

17:47.562 --> 17:49.230
Ray?

17:49.231 --> 17:50.731
Have you seen Zari?

17:50.732 --> 17:52.966
I just checked the engine
room, she's not there.

17:53.669 --> 17:54.568
No, I haven't.

17:55.503 --> 17:57.271
I'm sick and tired of playing mom.

17:57.272 --> 17:59.139
She's really starting to piss me off.

17:59.535 --> 18:01.241
Well, in the meantime,
how about some tea?

18:01.242 --> 18:03.844
It's my signature blend of
chamomile, lavender, and rose.

18:03.845 --> 18:05.512
Very relaxing!

18:05.513 --> 18:07.514
If you see Zari, tell
her I'm looking for her.

18:07.515 --> 18:08.784
Yeah.

18:10.418 --> 18:12.119
- Ray.
- Holy Toledo!

18:12.120 --> 18:14.354
Where'd you guys come from?
Were you spying on me?

18:14.355 --> 18:15.656
Of course you were, I
shouldn't say anything.

18:15.657 --> 18:16.890
Okay, I'll tell you everything!

18:16.891 --> 18:18.358
Constantine told me to kill Sara

18:18.359 --> 18:20.394
if Mallus ever takes
control of her again.

18:20.395 --> 18:22.329
Wow, dude, that's... that's heavy.

18:22.330 --> 18:25.699
Wait, maybe Sara Malluses
out and blows up the ship!

18:25.700 --> 18:26.900
What do you mean she blows up the ship?

18:26.901 --> 18:28.268
Zari's caught in a time loop

18:28.269 --> 18:29.602
and the ship explodes every hour.

18:29.603 --> 18:31.338
- Oh, like "Cause and Effect"
- What?

18:31.339 --> 18:32.806
"Star Trek: Next Generation"

18:32.807 --> 18:34.275
- It's "Groundhog Day."
- Fair enough.

18:34.276 --> 18:35.675
But "Star Trek"...

18:35.676 --> 18:37.544
Wait, the ship explodes in an hour?

18:37.545 --> 18:39.679
Yeah, actually, 24 minutes.

18:39.680 --> 18:41.448
And I think someone
onboard is causing it.

18:41.449 --> 18:42.982
- Mick.
- He's clean.

18:42.983 --> 18:44.451
Unlike his literary erotica.

18:44.452 --> 18:45.986
Excuse me, what?

18:45.987 --> 18:48.455
Long story, like
literally a long story.

18:48.456 --> 18:49.623
- So weird.
- 1,000 pages long.

18:49.624 --> 18:51.193
There was blue.

18:52.027 --> 18:53.493
Anyway, the captain's the only one

18:53.494 --> 18:54.762
we haven't checked out.

18:54.763 --> 18:56.497
For that, we need your help, Ray.

19:00.634 --> 19:01.935
What is she doing going
into the jumpship?

19:01.936 --> 19:04.472
With Gideon down, it's not
like she can go anywhere.

19:04.473 --> 19:06.340
Wait, is there a way she
could cause the explosion

19:06.341 --> 19:07.440
from the jumpship?

19:07.441 --> 19:09.043
Could be any number of ways.

19:09.044 --> 19:11.345
And with Mallus, who knows
what he's capable of?

19:11.346 --> 19:13.180
I'm worried about what
we're gonna find in there.

19:13.181 --> 19:14.481
I hope I don't have to use this.

19:14.482 --> 19:15.882
You ready?

19:15.883 --> 19:18.853
Yeah, let's shrink, Ray.

19:40.107 --> 19:41.542
You sure she can't see us?

19:41.543 --> 19:43.476
No, not when we're in stealth mode,

19:43.477 --> 19:46.213
which really just means library
voices and no sudden movements.

19:51.319 --> 19:53.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:53.221 --> 19:54.588
What are you up to?

19:54.589 --> 19:57.491
Oh, you know, crossword puzzles.

19:57.492 --> 19:58.759
You look tired.

19:58.760 --> 19:59.860
Thanks, jerk.

19:59.861 --> 20:01.495
No, no, I didn't...

20:01.496 --> 20:04.698
I mean, you always look good, I just...

20:04.699 --> 20:06.200
Did you have a long day, or...

20:06.201 --> 20:08.101
You have no idea.

20:08.102 --> 20:10.571
There's this person on my team,

20:10.572 --> 20:13.240
and she is reckless!

20:13.241 --> 20:16.844
She doesn't take orders.

20:16.845 --> 20:19.046
And it's like I want to tell her

20:19.047 --> 20:21.848
how important she is to this team.

20:21.849 --> 20:23.717
Because she is, but...

20:23.718 --> 20:26.220
Sometimes, I tell you.

20:26.221 --> 20:27.754
She does not make it easy.

20:27.755 --> 20:29.522
What'd she do?

20:29.523 --> 20:33.326
Well, she hijacked Gideon,
crashed our entire system

20:33.327 --> 20:35.029
testing out some simulation software

20:35.030 --> 20:36.930
that finds loopholes in history.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.666
That is definitely against regulations.

20:40.401 --> 20:42.736
Not that I haven't been
tempted to change the past.

20:42.737 --> 20:47.074
It's just... I don't even want
to start looking for loopholes,

20:47.075 --> 20:48.775
because then I'm gonna
start looking for ways

20:48.776 --> 20:50.077
to save my sister,

20:50.078 --> 20:51.711
and then I'm gonna drive myself crazy.

20:51.712 --> 20:54.781
Yes, you will. So don't.

20:54.782 --> 20:57.552
I'm just tired of always
being the bad cop, you know?

20:58.653 --> 21:00.554
Believe me, I understand.

21:00.555 --> 21:02.556
I've lost count of how many
times I've had to yell at

21:02.557 --> 21:05.792
cadets for screwing up or bust
them for breaking protocol.

21:05.793 --> 21:08.228
Yeah, I don't know, I feel
like you might like that.

21:08.229 --> 21:11.931
You seem to get a kick out
of ordering people around.

21:11.932 --> 21:14.135
Maybe, just a little bit.

21:15.670 --> 21:17.404
Where are you calling me from?

21:17.405 --> 21:19.840
I don't recognize that
part of the Waverider.

21:19.841 --> 21:22.075
Welcome to the jumpship.

21:22.076 --> 21:23.510
Are you hiding, Ms. Lance?

21:23.511 --> 21:24.878
No.

21:24.879 --> 21:28.149
I am simply looking for some privacy.

21:29.517 --> 21:32.253
Well, maybe I should come over.

21:34.088 --> 21:36.556
Yeah, yeah, but like, I mean,

21:36.557 --> 21:40.260
I'm sure that you are super, super busy.

21:40.261 --> 21:41.895
It's the perks of being the boss.

21:41.896 --> 21:44.097
I can just tell Gary I have a meeting.

21:44.098 --> 21:47.200
Yeah, boss, speaking
of, I should probably go

21:47.201 --> 21:48.635
check on the rest of the team,

21:48.636 --> 21:50.370
make sure nobody's gonna
blow up the ship.

21:51.823 --> 21:53.240
Okay...

21:53.241 --> 21:56.343
Well, yeah, if you... if
you change your mind, or...

21:56.344 --> 21:57.644
Whatever.

21:57.645 --> 21:58.879
Does Sara not realize

21:58.880 --> 22:00.680
how hard that woman's crushing on her?

22:00.681 --> 22:02.816
Maybe she's got no finish.

22:02.817 --> 22:05.051
No, the Captain knows how to close.

22:05.052 --> 22:07.020
This is something different.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.856
Hey. She's gonna hear us.

22:08.857 --> 22:10.123
Okay, do you hear that?
Cause I've been hearing

22:10.124 --> 22:12.659
this high-pitched buzzing sound.

22:12.660 --> 22:14.261
It sounds like there's
a fly in the jumpship.

22:14.262 --> 22:16.063
Did you say a fly? You have to kill it.

22:16.064 --> 22:17.564
You have no idea what year it's from.

22:17.565 --> 22:19.300
You could reintroduce the plague

22:19.301 --> 22:20.568
and have a whole other
crisis on your hands.

22:26.073 --> 22:27.275
Look out!

22:33.078 --> 22:36.507
"Groundhog Day," exploding ship,

22:36.508 --> 22:38.015
personal hell.

22:38.016 --> 22:39.217
We're stuck in a time loop!

22:39.218 --> 22:41.052
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

22:41.053 --> 22:43.855
It was only a matter of time
before we did one of these.

22:43.856 --> 22:45.123
Damn, girl, you look wrecked.

22:45.124 --> 22:46.391
How many times have we done this?

22:46.392 --> 22:47.592
How many times have you asked me

22:47.593 --> 22:49.027
how many times have we done this,

22:49.028 --> 22:50.629
or how many times have
we all been blown up?

22:50.630 --> 22:53.498
So you've been stuck in
this loop for a while?

22:53.499 --> 22:56.067
Yeah, like forever.

22:56.068 --> 22:57.369
It's okay.

22:57.370 --> 22:59.838
Maybe you could use a break.

22:59.839 --> 23:01.106
Have some fun?

23:01.107 --> 23:02.274
Fun?

23:02.275 --> 23:04.209
I blow up every hour.

23:04.210 --> 23:05.444
Exactly.

23:05.445 --> 23:07.413
No consequences.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.721
Cheers.

23:17.173 --> 23:18.757
Yeah!

23:38.059 --> 23:39.038
STRADIVARIUS

24:10.009 --> 24:13.811
Not bad, Mr. Rory, not at all.

24:13.812 --> 24:15.580
You're such an idiot.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.149
If you wash your clothes inside out,

24:17.150 --> 24:18.616
it keeps them looking newer longer.

24:18.617 --> 24:19.951
Try it.

24:19.952 --> 24:21.553
Oh, I never see you wear this.

24:21.554 --> 24:24.156
Stop touching my clothes.

24:24.157 --> 24:25.791
I'm just saying it's a nice color.

24:26.020 --> 24:29.045
GRUNT

24:30.901 --> 24:32.296
CONFUSED LOOKS

24:32.297 --> 24:34.289
SHIP GOES BOOM

24:40.306 --> 24:41.540
Nate.

24:41.541 --> 24:43.141
Hey... Amaya and I were just...

24:43.142 --> 24:44.676
Feeling bad that you two had sex

24:44.677 --> 24:45.944
and almost screwed up a
mission, don't care.

24:45.945 --> 24:47.445
"Groundhog Day," ship explodes.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.347
Wait, you're caught in a time loop?

24:49.348 --> 24:51.216
- That's awesome!
- I can't do this anymore.

24:51.217 --> 24:53.552
- I'm losing my mind.
- Wait, did you do the...

24:53.553 --> 24:55.152
- Fun montage?
- Yeah.

24:55.153 --> 24:57.022
Yeah, thanks for that.
You're a good friend.

24:59.425 --> 25:01.559
Nothing's fun anymore.

25:02.032 --> 25:04.896
That's not good.

25:07.494 --> 25:08.834
Hey, take it easy!

25:08.835 --> 25:10.167
This is the only
option I haven't tried.

25:10.168 --> 25:11.403
Maybe it'll stop the loop.

25:11.404 --> 25:12.510
Hey! What the hell's going on?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.506
Don't come closer.

25:17.822 --> 25:19.344
Typical!

25:19.345 --> 25:20.979
Hey.

25:20.980 --> 25:22.714
It's okay, let's talk this one through.

25:22.715 --> 25:25.183
It doesn't matter,
you won't believe me.

25:25.184 --> 25:26.952
Try me.

25:26.953 --> 25:30.622
I keep reliving the same
hour over and over again,

25:30.623 --> 25:33.258
and no matter what I
do, the ship explodes

25:33.259 --> 25:34.559
and kills us all.

25:34.560 --> 25:36.427
And I'm totally alone in it,

25:36.428 --> 25:38.163
because for some reason, I'm the only one

25:38.164 --> 25:40.365
that's even aware that it's happening.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.767
And I try so hard,

25:42.768 --> 25:46.972
but I can never save any of you.

25:48.340 --> 25:51.109
Okay, I want to help.

25:51.110 --> 25:53.177
Wait, you believe me?

25:53.178 --> 25:55.113
Yeah, how much time do we have left?

25:59.352 --> 26:01.719
All right, people, for reasons
that are too complicated

26:01.720 --> 26:03.688
to explain right now, we
have to search the ship.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.022
Zari says that there's a bomb,

26:05.023 --> 26:06.124
and it's gonna explode in 30 minutes.

26:06.125 --> 26:07.692
We have to find out why.

26:07.693 --> 26:10.161
Okay, well, the galley is clear.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.330
Right, and I checked
the sleeping quarters.

26:12.933 --> 26:14.765
You went in our rooms?

26:14.766 --> 26:16.234
Yeah.

26:16.235 --> 26:17.602
The library...

26:17.603 --> 26:19.003
What did you see in the library?

26:19.004 --> 26:21.706
Something I can never un-see.

26:21.707 --> 26:24.977
Guys, I think I looked
everywhere, there's nothing.

26:33.585 --> 26:36.021
You didn't check the trash compacter.

26:36.022 --> 26:38.523
I didn't even know there
was a trash compacter.

26:38.524 --> 26:40.325
Well, it's not really part of the tour.

26:43.729 --> 26:45.029
Gary?

26:45.030 --> 26:46.731
Ah, the time dweeb!

26:46.732 --> 26:48.366
What the hell are you doing here?

26:48.367 --> 26:49.835
Thank God you found me!

26:49.836 --> 26:52.103
What are you doing down there?

26:52.104 --> 26:54.439
I... I tried to portal onto the bridge,

26:54.440 --> 26:56.875
but didn't account for drift
in the temporal zone.

26:56.876 --> 26:59.444
My landing was hot and my
time courier broke on impact.

26:59.445 --> 27:01.112
That's how I got stuck in here.

27:01.113 --> 27:03.981
Not the plan, but I adapted!

27:03.982 --> 27:05.483
Yeah, but why are you on the ship?

27:05.484 --> 27:07.085
What the hell you got in here?

27:07.724 --> 27:09.354
- A bomb?
- No!

27:09.650 --> 27:12.050
No! That was our
only chance of surviving.

27:12.051 --> 27:13.024
What do you mean?

27:13.025 --> 27:14.893
He just destroyed the chrono-repeater

27:14.894 --> 27:17.996
I used to initiate a time loop
in order to save you guys.

27:17.997 --> 27:20.265
- What?
- I always wanted to die young.

27:20.266 --> 27:22.367
Okay, nobody is going to die.

27:22.368 --> 27:25.237
Well... actually, I got
an alert that the Waverider

27:25.238 --> 27:27.772
exploded at precisely 4:20
temporal standard time.

27:27.773 --> 27:28.906
- What?
- 4:20!

27:28.907 --> 27:30.242
Get to the point, Gary.

27:30.243 --> 27:31.643
I took matters into my own hands,

27:31.644 --> 27:33.044
but because of my little portal mishap,

27:33.045 --> 27:34.545
I couldn't warn you about the bomb!

27:34.546 --> 27:36.047
But I could operate the chrono-repeater,

27:36.048 --> 27:37.314
which is programmed to
start a one hour loop

27:37.315 --> 27:38.917
prior to the explosion,

27:38.918 --> 27:40.118
and I had hoped that would
give you enough time

27:40.119 --> 27:41.419
to diffuse the bomb yourselves.

27:41.420 --> 27:43.087
So now that this is destroyed...

27:43.088 --> 27:44.522
There are no more time loops.

27:44.523 --> 27:46.457
So once there's an explosion, that's it.

27:46.458 --> 27:48.225
Kablooey!

27:48.226 --> 27:50.328
All right, so what you're
saying is we have five minutes

27:50.329 --> 27:52.463
to find this bomb before we all die.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.066
Permanently.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.156
All right, people,
we've got five minutes

27:58.157 --> 28:00.149
to find this bomb before it explodes.

28:00.150 --> 28:01.557
We gotta think fast.

28:01.558 --> 28:02.835
Before I portaled onto the ship,

28:02.836 --> 28:04.736
I traced the temporal
signature of the bomb.

28:04.737 --> 28:06.572
It originated in 1975.

28:06.573 --> 28:09.075
So the bomb must be something
from your last mission.

28:09.076 --> 28:11.409
It could be hidden in the heel
of one of the platform shoes.

28:11.410 --> 28:13.279
What about that stupid song?

28:15.219 --> 28:16.547
Genius!

28:23.990 --> 28:26.091
The one place I didn't look.

28:26.092 --> 28:27.759
Why the hell would someone put a bomb

28:27.760 --> 28:29.094
inside of an anachronism?

28:29.095 --> 28:30.396
Damien Darhk must've planted it there,

28:30.397 --> 28:31.831
knowing you'd bring it onboard.

28:31.832 --> 28:32.998
Well, then let's get it offboard.

28:32.999 --> 28:34.433
No, we have to diffuse it!

28:34.434 --> 28:36.068
We can't open the doors without Gideon.

28:36.069 --> 28:38.038
- Burn it!
- That'll make it explode.

28:38.039 --> 28:38.937
You know, for a guy who loves fire,

28:38.938 --> 28:40.138
you really have no idea how it works.

28:40.139 --> 28:41.740
What about you, Zari? Come on.

28:41.741 --> 28:43.074
This whole time that
you've been on the ship,

28:43.075 --> 28:45.110
did you learn anything that could help?

28:45.111 --> 28:47.814
Right. Let me think.

28:55.788 --> 28:57.256
Zari?

28:57.257 --> 28:59.225
Sorry, Captain.

29:02.195 --> 29:03.361
My beer is in there!

29:03.362 --> 29:05.031
What the hell are you doing?

29:06.466 --> 29:07.666
Look, the force field's
not strong enough

29:07.667 --> 29:09.168
to contain the explosion!

29:09.169 --> 29:11.069
No, but it'll keep you
guys out long enough

29:11.070 --> 29:13.839
for me to say what I need to say.

29:13.840 --> 29:15.206
Zari...

29:15.207 --> 29:17.709
Mick...

29:17.710 --> 29:19.545
You don't have to hide what you love.

29:21.014 --> 29:24.116
Follow your heart, and keep writing.

29:24.117 --> 29:25.517
Zari, we don't have time for this!

29:25.518 --> 29:27.485
Nate and Amaya,

29:27.486 --> 29:29.755
I'm so lucky to call you guys my friends.

29:29.756 --> 29:31.056
Zari, the bomb!

29:31.057 --> 29:33.425
What you guys have is so special.

29:33.426 --> 29:36.194
I mean, the way you look at each other

29:36.195 --> 29:40.865
honestly makes me want to
puke, but don't fight it.

29:40.866 --> 29:43.068
You're crazy about each other.

29:43.069 --> 29:45.104
Just don't have sex on missions.

29:46.739 --> 29:48.373
Z, what are you doing?

29:48.374 --> 29:49.775
What you would do, Ray.

29:51.210 --> 29:53.212
You know, when I first came on board,

29:53.213 --> 29:55.914
you were so nice and polite to me

29:55.915 --> 29:58.517
that I wanted to punch you.

29:58.518 --> 30:01.754
But I realize now the world
would be a better place

30:01.755 --> 30:03.989
if we were all a little more like you.

30:05.892 --> 30:08.327
But being nice and polite's
only gonna get you so far,

30:08.328 --> 30:11.363
so do me a favor, and tell Sara
why you're so afraid of her.

30:11.364 --> 30:12.531
Okay, sure.

30:12.532 --> 30:13.699
But first, I'm gonna figure out

30:13.700 --> 30:15.000
how to shut down the force field

30:15.001 --> 30:16.201
so we can deal with the bomb.

30:16.202 --> 30:18.169
I am dealing with the bomb.

30:18.170 --> 30:19.871
Zari, look, you need to listen to me.

30:19.872 --> 30:25.210
Sara, you are an infuriating,
stubborn pain in my ass.

30:25.211 --> 30:28.246
Because you have to be.

30:28.247 --> 30:30.649
You're not just the captain of this ship,

30:30.650 --> 30:32.717
you are its soul.

30:32.718 --> 30:38.123
You are so fierce and unflinching.

30:38.124 --> 30:40.325
But why not apply some
of that fearlessness

30:40.326 --> 30:44.463
to your own life and just
ask poor Eva out already.

30:47.267 --> 30:49.034
Did you have a
meaningful message for me?

30:49.035 --> 30:50.435
Not now, Gary!

30:50.436 --> 30:52.537
Zari, let us in! We
can do this together!

30:52.538 --> 30:54.073
No.

30:54.074 --> 30:58.043
I have spent so much time with you guys.

31:00.013 --> 31:01.880
You're my family now.

31:01.881 --> 31:04.850
You deserve to be happy, and if...

31:04.851 --> 31:06.985
If I can be a small part
of making that happen,

31:06.986 --> 31:10.089
then this will be worth it.

31:10.090 --> 31:11.623
- Zari.
- Look. That won't work!

31:11.624 --> 31:13.426
You won't be able to
contain the explosion.

31:16.429 --> 31:18.632
Zari, you don't have to do this!

31:27.506 --> 31:31.109
Zari, as your captain, I am
ordering you to stand down!

31:31.110 --> 31:33.745
You should know by now I'm
not good at following orders.

31:33.746 --> 31:35.581
You just told me what
a good captain I am,

31:35.582 --> 31:37.282
and now you're not gonna listen to me?

31:37.283 --> 31:39.518
Yeah, but this time, I'm
not doing it for myself,

31:39.519 --> 31:40.553
I'm doing it for you.

31:42.889 --> 31:44.989
I love you guys.

31:44.990 --> 31:45.858
Zari...

32:19.992 --> 32:21.126
Who the hell are you?

32:21.127 --> 32:22.894
You know who I am, Zari.

32:22.895 --> 32:24.830
Even though you may have
never seen my face.

32:24.831 --> 32:26.631
Gideon?

32:26.632 --> 32:29.034
- You're real?
- Of course I'm real.

32:29.035 --> 32:30.936
Just because I'm an
artificial intelligence

32:30.937 --> 32:32.504
doesn't mean I don't exist.

32:33.907 --> 32:36.542
What's happening?

32:36.543 --> 32:39.177
If you tell me I've been
dreaming this whole time,

32:39.178 --> 32:41.847
I'm gonna kill you, real or not.

32:41.848 --> 32:44.449
You're not dreaming,
but you're not awake.

32:44.450 --> 32:46.618
In real life, you're
actually in the MedBay.

32:46.619 --> 32:48.287
Unconscious and healing.

32:51.791 --> 32:53.258
What happened to me?

32:53.259 --> 32:54.859
After your fight with Sara,

32:54.860 --> 32:57.162
you went into the engine
room to make repairs,

32:57.163 --> 32:58.563
and there was an accident.

32:58.564 --> 33:00.765
Right, I was hit with that time sludge.

33:00.766 --> 33:02.567
This sludge, as you call it,

33:02.568 --> 33:04.035
is a highly volatile substance,

33:04.036 --> 33:06.804
which helps power the ship through time.

33:06.805 --> 33:08.173
You're lucky to be alive.

33:08.174 --> 33:10.442
So if my body's in the MedBay,

33:10.443 --> 33:12.577
then where is my mind?

33:12.578 --> 33:16.381
Your mind is in here,
with me in my matrix.

33:16.382 --> 33:18.183
I was able to upload your subconscious

33:18.184 --> 33:20.018
via the neuro-monitor.

33:20.019 --> 33:23.021
Well, so none of this is real?

33:23.022 --> 33:26.058
Not in the way you're used to.

33:26.059 --> 33:27.892
Why did you bring me here?

33:27.893 --> 33:30.495
When you posed the question
about changing 2042,

33:30.496 --> 33:31.930
your simulator went into overdrive

33:31.931 --> 33:33.699
searching for an answer.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.168
And a sampling of those
trillions of possible answers

33:36.169 --> 33:38.403
showed me that there was one constant:

33:38.404 --> 33:40.072
You.

33:40.073 --> 33:43.742
In order to save 2042, to
find your so-called loophole,

33:43.743 --> 33:45.944
you must work with the Legends.

33:45.945 --> 33:47.779
Hold up.

33:47.780 --> 33:49.849
You're saying my simulator works?

33:53.253 --> 33:56.087
Did my program predict
that I'd bail on the team?

33:56.088 --> 33:58.323
In almost every variation
of the timeline,

33:58.324 --> 33:59.825
your fight with Captain Lance

33:59.826 --> 34:01.693
precipitated your leaving the ship.

34:01.694 --> 34:04.196
So your goal was to get me to choose

34:04.197 --> 34:05.430
to stay with the Legends.

34:05.431 --> 34:06.931
I put you into your own program,

34:06.932 --> 34:08.666
and devised a scenario where the only way

34:08.667 --> 34:10.435
to successfully complete the simulation

34:10.436 --> 34:12.370
was to grow closer to the team

34:12.371 --> 34:14.406
and develop a bond.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.476
What about the bomb?

34:19.478 --> 34:21.813
It was just a plot
device I incorporated.

34:21.813 --> 34:23.447
A problem to solve.

34:23.449 --> 34:26.217
But the real problem was you.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.020
If you stayed angry after
your fight with Sara,

34:28.021 --> 34:29.954
you would've left the team.

34:29.955 --> 34:31.889
And without you and your totem,
there would've been no chance

34:31.891 --> 34:34.726
in the coming days to
defeat Mallus or save 2042.

34:37.529 --> 34:38.996
So, the interactions,

34:38.998 --> 34:40.632
the things I learned about the team,

34:40.632 --> 34:42.132
they... they were all fake?

34:42.134 --> 34:43.969
Everything you experienced
was extrapolated

34:43.969 --> 34:45.536
from my current knowledge of the Legends.

34:45.538 --> 34:49.440
While not real, what you saw was true.

34:49.442 --> 34:51.810
It doesn't take a supercomputer
to predict that those two

34:51.811 --> 34:53.078
would wind up dinky-tickling

34:53.079 --> 34:54.913
once Amaya returned to the team.

34:58.579 --> 35:00.818
This one seemed less plausible.

35:00.819 --> 35:03.822
We'll have to ask Mr. Rory.

35:03.823 --> 35:07.191
I am terrified and
in awe of you, Gideon.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.727
Who knew you were such an evil genius?

35:09.728 --> 35:11.363
And a bit of a perv.

35:11.364 --> 35:13.365
You never bothered to ask.

35:13.366 --> 35:15.233
It's an impressive piece
of software you designed,

35:15.234 --> 35:16.401
Ms. Tomaz.

35:16.402 --> 35:18.036
Is that compliment, Gideon?

35:18.037 --> 35:20.705
Don't let it go to your head.

35:20.706 --> 35:21.839
Are you ready to wake up now?

35:21.840 --> 35:23.475
One last question.

35:23.476 --> 35:26.511
Gary... why even have
him in the time loop,

35:26.512 --> 35:27.913
if he was just gonna be stuck

35:27.914 --> 35:29.948
in the trash compacter the whole time?

35:29.949 --> 35:31.083
Thought it'd be funny.

35:34.953 --> 35:38.027
Hey, rise and shine.

35:38.028 --> 35:39.361
How are you feeling?

35:39.362 --> 35:41.932
Oh, like my head is made of cement.

35:41.933 --> 35:43.800
You were exposed to the
ship's Bosonic hyper-fluid

35:43.801 --> 35:44.968
in the engine room.

35:44.969 --> 35:46.402
Knocked you out for hours.

35:46.403 --> 35:48.270
Oh, man, I have such a Gideon hangover.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.605
What do you mean?

35:49.606 --> 35:50.635
While I was out,

35:50.636 --> 35:53.442
Gideon transported
my consciousness into a matrix.

35:53.443 --> 35:54.877
Okay.

35:54.878 --> 35:56.546
I think you dreamt that.

35:56.547 --> 35:58.310
No, it wasn't a dream, it was real.

35:58.311 --> 35:58.976
Right, Gideon?

35:58.977 --> 36:02.184
Unfortunately, I don't know
what you're talking about, Ms. Tomaz.

36:02.185 --> 36:04.487
Oh, that is cold, Gideon.

36:04.488 --> 36:06.389
After all that, we're still not friends?

36:06.390 --> 36:08.825
Zari, are you sure you're okay?

36:08.826 --> 36:11.127
Gideon trapped me in my own simulator,

36:11.128 --> 36:14.096
so I was stuck on the Waverider
reliving the same hour

36:14.097 --> 36:15.932
over and over again.

36:15.933 --> 36:19.340
Needless to say, I got to know
you all really, really well.

36:19.341 --> 36:20.336
Right.

36:20.337 --> 36:21.771
Could be caused by the sedative dosage.

36:21.772 --> 36:23.506
- I could look into it later.
- Yeah.

36:23.507 --> 36:26.075
I'm telling the truth. You
know what, I'll prove it.

36:26.076 --> 36:29.712
Sara, ask Ray what Constantine
told him about you.

36:29.713 --> 36:31.180
Okay.

36:31.181 --> 36:34.651
Ray, what did Constantine
tell you about me?

36:36.920 --> 36:37.954
How did you know that?

36:41.292 --> 36:45.361
Okay, he warned me that if you
were possessed by Mallus again

36:45.362 --> 36:50.099
and lost control, that
I... I should kill you.

36:51.105 --> 36:53.068
Oh, such a relief to
get that off my chest.

36:53.069 --> 36:56.739
Well, he's right.

36:56.740 --> 36:58.541
You should kill me if
Mallus takes over again,

36:58.542 --> 37:00.677
and you are going to need a lot of help.

37:00.678 --> 37:03.613
Well, let's just hope it
doesn't come down to that.

37:05.282 --> 37:08.101
Hey, you wanna get a coffee?

37:08.102 --> 37:09.220
Yeah.

37:10.654 --> 37:13.422
Aren't you wondering what
I learned about you?

37:13.423 --> 37:15.992
Do I want to know?

37:15.993 --> 37:17.994
You're afraid of historical loopholes

37:17.995 --> 37:20.398
because you'd be tempted
to save your sister.

37:22.799 --> 37:26.737
Well, not a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

37:29.139 --> 37:31.007
I'm sorry I fried Gideon,

37:31.008 --> 37:34.644
but I had to know if there was
a way to save my brother.

37:38.148 --> 37:41.750
And what did the simulation say?

37:41.751 --> 37:44.353
It said I can't do it alone.

37:44.354 --> 37:47.457
Sounds like you're gonna need a team.

37:47.458 --> 37:50.092
You mean it?

37:50.093 --> 37:52.896
I've been thinking about
it, saving your brother,

37:52.897 --> 37:55.598
and technically, it isn't a loophole.

37:55.599 --> 37:58.768
It would be changing your past,
but your past is my future,

37:58.769 --> 38:00.236
and as far as I'm concerned,

38:00.237 --> 38:02.806
well, the future's an open road.

38:04.308 --> 38:06.476
And besides, I'll probably need
your help fighting Mallus.

38:09.913 --> 38:13.248
Hey, listen, it's none
of my business, but...

38:13.249 --> 38:15.051
You should ask Eva out.

38:16.264 --> 38:19.789
My relationships have
a way of ending badly.

38:19.790 --> 38:22.058
You know, it turns out

38:22.059 --> 38:25.060
at the end of the day,
love is worth the risk.

38:25.061 --> 38:26.696
None of us can do this alone.

38:27.964 --> 38:29.199
Captain.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.909
So you're saying it's
like "Groundhog Day."

38:39.910 --> 38:42.144
That's what I was told... by you.

38:42.145 --> 38:45.748
It's good to know matrix-me
is still a Bill Murray fan.

38:45.749 --> 38:47.950
So, you said you wanted
to tell us something.

38:47.951 --> 38:49.752
Yeah, you guys used
the flasher to forget

38:49.753 --> 38:51.754
you almost blew the mission
by sneaking off to have sex.

38:51.755 --> 38:53.156
What?

38:53.157 --> 38:54.857
I think we'd remember doing that.

38:54.858 --> 38:56.959
Nathaniel, that is the whole
point of a memory eraser,

38:56.960 --> 38:58.528
is that we don't remember.

38:58.529 --> 39:01.197
Guys, bashing yourselves
is a temporary solution.

39:01.198 --> 39:02.699
You need to work your stuff out.

39:04.902 --> 39:06.335
Wow.

39:06.336 --> 39:09.438
Ray must have used a
strong sedative on her,

39:09.439 --> 39:13.009
because there is no way we
would ever use the flash gun,

39:13.010 --> 39:14.243
that's crazy.

39:14.244 --> 39:16.846
It's not so crazy.

39:16.847 --> 39:18.581
Amaya!

39:18.582 --> 39:21.117
I saw Rory using it to get
that song out of his head,

39:21.118 --> 39:23.419
and I thought that is a brilliant idea.

39:23.420 --> 39:26.222
But Zari's probably right.

39:26.223 --> 39:28.891
- Totally, no flash guns.
- Yeah.

39:28.892 --> 39:30.326
We should talk about our feelings.

39:30.327 --> 39:31.694
Yes, yes.

39:31.695 --> 39:34.230
We'll just... we'll leave it here.

39:34.231 --> 39:35.832
Just in case.

39:35.833 --> 39:37.800
Not that we would ever use it.

39:37.801 --> 39:39.803
- Who uses those things?
- Who does?

39:43.707 --> 39:45.341
I'm busy!

39:45.342 --> 39:47.710
You should be, you have
a lot of writing to do.

39:49.379 --> 39:52.882
I know you're writing a
novel, and it's really good.

39:52.883 --> 39:54.584
But that ending needs a rewrite.

39:54.585 --> 39:56.786
I mean, Buck is such a
misfit, that at the end,

39:56.787 --> 39:59.889
we just want to see him
embrace his new family.

39:59.890 --> 40:01.958
Just a thought.

40:08.765 --> 40:11.068
I wonder.

40:51.475 --> 40:54.109
"Buck wrapped his glistening biceps

40:54.110 --> 40:58.181
"around his busty alien queen.

40:58.182 --> 41:00.249
"He'd lost his planet,

41:00.250 --> 41:02.886
but found his home."

41:05.856 --> 41:07.591
Not bad.

41:23.159 --> 41:25.300
YUNNAN PROVINCE, CHINA - 2018

41:25.309 --> 41:30.140
I am calm, I am present.

41:30.141 --> 41:32.783
I am centered.

41:33.784 --> 41:35.785
Wally West.

41:35.786 --> 41:37.186
You're not an easy man to find.

41:37.187 --> 41:40.656
No, that's the point of meditation.

41:40.657 --> 41:41.690
Who are you?

41:41.691 --> 41:42.991
My name is Rip Hunter.

41:42.992 --> 41:46.262
I am trying to save the universe...

41:47.364 --> 41:49.266
And I need your help.
