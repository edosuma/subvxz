WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:01.894
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:03.500 --> 00:05.127
Emily: I KNOW I SCREWED UP THE
SCHOLARSHIPS IF I CAN'T SWIM.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.728
YOU STILL HAVEN'T TOLD US
THE WHOLE TRUTH

00:06.770 --> 00:07.794
ABOUT HOW IT HAPPENED.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.205
Emily: IT DOESN'T MATTER HOW.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.502
IT MATTERS TO US
AND TO FAMILY SERVICES.

00:10.540 --> 00:11.507
THOSE PEOPLE THINK THAT

00:11.540 --> 00:13.633
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU
HAPPENED IN THIS HOUSE.

00:13.680 --> 00:14.635
I'M NOT GOING TO UPENN.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.204
SPENCER THIS ISN'T FUNNY.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.649
I GOT MY REJECT ION LE'I'I'ER.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.046
VIENNA?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME WITH ME?

00:20.080 --> 00:21.342
YOU HAVE TO GO
TO VIENNA WITH ZACK.

00:21.380 --> 00:22.711
MIKE AND I, WE'RE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE WITH DAD.

00:22.750 --> 00:23.717
HEY WHAT'S THIS SONG?

00:23.750 --> 00:25.388
( bird whistling )

00:25.420 --> 00:26.409
IT'S NOT A SONG,
IT'S A PHONE NUMBER.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.654
WHERE IS THIS AREA CODE ANYWAYS?

00:27.690 --> 00:28.657
YORK COUNTY.

00:28.690 --> 00:30.351
DID ALI KNOW
ANYBODY FROM THERE?

00:30.390 --> 00:32.221
I'M GUESSING THAT SHE CALLED
HER BEACH HO'I'I'IE.

00:32.260 --> 00:33.227
BOARD SHORTS.

00:33.260 --> 00:34.397
LET IT GO, SPENCER.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.227
WHY DO YOU STILL
THINK ALI'S ALIVE?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.419
LET IT GO OR IT
WILL COME APART

00:37.470 --> 00:39.392
IN WAYS THAT YOU
CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.793
DID YOU KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN?

00:40.840 --> 00:42.705
I'VE BEEN PROTECTING YOU
SINCE IT STARTED.

00:42.740 --> 00:43.832
Hanna: THE POLICE HAVE
OUR NAMES ON A BOARD

00:43.870 --> 00:45.269
WITH ARROWS AND GRAPHS.

00:45.310 --> 00:46.777
AND NOT JUST OURS,
MY MOM'S UP THERE.

00:46.810 --> 00:49.278
I KNOW YOU WERE HERE THE NIGHT
THAT WILDEN WAS KILLED.

00:49.310 --> 00:52.074
SHE CALLED ME, CAME OVER,
SAID SHE NEED MONEY.

00:52.120 --> 00:53.849
AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN
YOU TOLD HER NO?

00:53.880 --> 00:55.313
I KEEP A GUN LOCKED
IN MY DESK.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.317
IT'S MISSING.

00:56.350 --> 00:59.217
HANNA, WHAT'S WRONG?
I THINK MY MOM KILLED WILDEN

00:59.260 --> 01:00.511
AND "A" KNOWS IT.

01:02.560 --> 01:05.552
( screaming )

01:08.330 --> 01:09.627
MOM!

01:22.510 --> 01:23.841
MOM?

01:31.250 --> 01:32.888
MOM?

01:32.920 --> 01:34.581
HMM?
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:34.620 --> 01:37.521
I HAD A NIGHTMARE.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.853
( screaming )

01:40.900 --> 01:43.596
( both screaming )

01:47.870 --> 01:49.406
MOM!

01:51.170 --> 01:52.307
HAN NA?

01:52.340 --> 01:53.432
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:53.480 --> 01:56.540
YEAH. YEAH, I'M FINE.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.468
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

01:58.510 --> 01:59.647
WHAT?

01:59.680 --> 02:01.477
NO.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.114
NO, NOT YET.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.714
OKAY.

02:13.330 --> 02:15.423
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

02:15.460 --> 02:17.894
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

02:17.930 --> 02:20.398
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

02:20.440 --> 02:23.159
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

02:23.210 --> 02:27.909
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

02:27.940 --> 02:30.500
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

02:30.550 --> 02:33.178
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

02:38.650 --> 02:41.619
Veronica:
GOOD MORNING.

02:41.660 --> 02:42.922
MORNING.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.383
I JUST SPOKE TO MELISSA.

02:45.430 --> 02:47.398
SHE STARTED
HER INTERNSHIP TODAY.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.261
YEAH?

02:49.300 --> 02:51.894
WHAT DID SHE SAY?

02:51.930 --> 02:55.468
LONDON IS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT VERY COLD.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.559
SOUNDS LIKE
A PERFECT MATCH.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.277
THIS IS FOR YOU.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.442
WHAT IS THAT?

03:06.580 --> 03:07.410
IT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO READ

03:07.450 --> 03:09.441
BEFORE YOUR MEETING WITH
BRENDAN MCGOWAN.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.219
UMM...

03:11.250 --> 03:12.581
WHO'S THAT?

03:12.620 --> 03:14.451
HE'S A PRIVATE
ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR.

03:14.490 --> 03:15.855
HE'S GOING TO HELP
YOU WITH COLLEGE.

03:17.260 --> 03:18.181
HOW?

03:18.230 --> 03:21.757
THE CARLYLES HIRED HIM
AFI'ER NORA GOT THAT DUI.

03:21.800 --> 03:24.268
WITH BRENDAN SHE WAS STILL
ABLE TO GO TO HER SECOND CHOICE.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.336
BUT I DON'T HAVE A DUI.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.564
NO.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.534
BUT YOU HAVE RADLEY.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.705
BRENDAN WILL KNOW
WHICH SCHOOLS TO TARGET

03:32.740 --> 03:34.332
AND HOW TO MAKE YOU
MOST ATTRACTIVE TO THEM.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.302
OH, HE'S LIKE
AN IW LEAGUE PIMP.

03:36.350 --> 03:38.409
SWEETIE,
YOU'VE WORKED HARD

03:38.450 --> 03:41.010
AND YOU DESERVE TO GO
TO A GOOD SCHOOL.

03:41.050 --> 03:42.540
WE JUST NEED TO
RE-POSITION YOU.

03:42.590 --> 03:46.583
MOM, I AM NOT A SOFA,
OKAY?

03:46.620 --> 03:49.657
AND NOBODY IS MORE UPSET
THAN I AM THAT I DIDN'T
GET INTO UPENN,

03:49.690 --> 03:52.022
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I CAN'T GET INTO
OTHER GOOD SCHOOLS.

03:52.060 --> 03:55.393
I AGREE,
AND SO DOES BRENDAN.

04:00.370 --> 04:01.860
( knocking )
Wayne: HEY.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.902
I WAS GONNA MAKE
US SOME BREAKFAST.
YOU GOT TIME?

04:03.940 --> 04:05.999
YEAH.
I THINK SO.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.804
WHAT ABOUT MOM?

04:08.840 --> 04:10.603
SHE IS AT THE GYM.

04:10.650 --> 04:12.470
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME
THIS WEEK

04:12.520 --> 04:13.544
SHE'S LEFT BEFORE
IT'S LIGHT OUT.

04:13.580 --> 04:14.672
I KNOW, SHE'S...

04:14.720 --> 04:16.517
REALLY WORKING HARD TO--

04:16.550 --> 04:17.881
AVOID THE NEIGHBORS?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.457
( Wayne sighs )
YEAH.

04:22.960 --> 04:25.349
LISTEN, IT WILL
ALL BLOW OVER, EMMY.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.789
I PROMISE.

04:26.830 --> 04:28.991
NOT WITHOUT HUMILIATING
YOU BOTH FIRST.

04:29.030 --> 04:32.067
I'VE BEEN IN SCARIER
COMBAT ZONES THAN THIS TOWN.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.694
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE THAN
A COUPLE OF DIRTY LOOKS

04:34.740 --> 04:36.628
AT THE HARDWARE STORE
TO TAKE ME OUT.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.799
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL CAMPUS.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.602
YEAH, IT'S OKAY.

04:53.820 --> 04:56.789
I'M SORRY THAT WE CAN'T
MAKE THAT WORK FOR YOU.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.492
DAD, IT'S OKAY.

04:59.530 --> 05:01.623
EVEN IF WE COULD AFFORD IT,

05:01.660 --> 05:02.467
I DOUBT I'D EVEN GET IN.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.388
WHY WOULD YOU SAY
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

05:04.430 --> 05:09.800
BECAUSE WITHOUT SWIMMING,
I'M...

05:09.840 --> 05:11.432
AVERAGE.

05:11.470 --> 05:14.633
THERE IS NOTHING AVERAGE
ABOUT YOU.

05:17.710 --> 05:20.918
I KNOW I CAN'T DO MUCH...

05:22.890 --> 05:24.039
BUT WANT YOU TO KNOW

05:24.090 --> 05:27.082
I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO HELP YOU.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.678
I'M GONNA GO MAKE
THAT BREAKFAST.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.753
THOSE EGGS AREN'T GOING
TO BURN THEMSELVES.

05:37.430 --> 05:39.398
YOU'RE REPRESENTING YOUR FAMILY,

05:39.440 --> 05:42.136
YOUR SCHOOL, AND YOUR COMMUNITY
DURING THESE COLLEGE VISITS.

05:42.170 --> 05:43.808
TRANSLATION?

05:43.840 --> 05:47.571
DO NOT USE THIS WEEKEND
TO DISCOVER BEER PONG.

05:47.610 --> 05:48.907
YOU ARE TO USE THIS TIME

05:48.940 --> 05:51.545
TO AUDIT CLASSES,
TOUR THE CAMPUS,

05:51.580 --> 05:53.969
AND DECIDE IF THIS IS
WHERE YOU WANT TO GO.

05:54.020 --> 05:56.011
( bell rings )

05:57.620 --> 05:59.918
HEY, YOU GUYS,
WHY WOULD I DREAM THAT?

05:59.960 --> 06:02.155
I MEAN, "A" IS ABOUT TO DROP
THE HAMMER ON MY MOM.

06:02.190 --> 06:03.782
THE ONLY THING YOUR DREAM
IS TELLING YOU

06:03.830 --> 06:06.025
IS THAT YOU SHOULD BE DRINKING
WARM MILK BEFORE BED.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.857
MY DAD'S GUN IS MISSING,
SPENCER.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.095
YEAH, AND THAT LOOK REALLY BAD,
BUT WE'VE GONE OVER THIS.

06:10.130 --> 06:11.859
"A" HAS TRIED
TO FRAME US BEFORE--

06:11.900 --> 06:13.458
NO, IT'S NOT FRAMING
IF YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!

06:13.500 --> 06:14.831
HANNA, THIS IS YOUR MOTHER.

06:14.870 --> 06:17.100
OKAY, LOOKED YOU IN THE EYE
AND TOLD YOU SHE DIDN'T.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.937
Ella: DON'T YOU GUYS
HAVE A CLASS TO GET TO?

06:18.970 --> 06:21.109
YEAH, WE'RE GOING.

06:21.140 --> 06:23.973
YOU'D GET THERE FASTER IF
YOUR FEET WERE ACTUALLY MOVING.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.877
WHOA, WHAT'S
WITH YOUR MOM?

06:26.920 --> 06:28.478
KIN DA HARSH.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.512
I DON'T KNOW. SHE'S BEEN
REALLY WEIRD THE PAST FEW DAYS.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.984
MAKES ME WONDER IF "A's" MOVED
ON FROM HANNA'S MOM TO MINE.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.523
WELL, "A" CAN MULTI-TASK.

06:36.560 --> 06:37.879
CAN YOU GUYS
COME OVER AFTER SCHOOL?

06:37.930 --> 06:39.022
I CAN'T.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.426
I HAVE A STRATEGY SESSION
AT THE BREW.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.668
MY MOM'S HIRED A SPIN-DOCTOR
TO MAKE ME SHINY AND NEW AGAIN.

06:44.700 --> 06:45.667
Aria: SORRY?

06:45.700 --> 06:47.065
IT'S AN ADMISSIONS COACH.

06:47.100 --> 06:48.590
SHE WANTS HIM
TO WAVE HIS MAGIC LOAFER

06:48.640 --> 06:50.835
AND GET ME INTO COLLEGE.

06:50.870 --> 06:52.872
Hanna: ALL RIGHT,
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, GUYS.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.002
Aria: OKAY.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.100
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK A
SPIN-DOCT OR LIKE THAT COST?

06:57.150 --> 06:58.208
IT'S THE HASTINGS,

06:58.250 --> 06:59.842
SO I'M GUESSING
IT COSTS THAN YOUR CAR.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.542
GUYS, THIS ISN'T
ABOUT MONEY, OKAY?

07:02.590 --> 07:05.184
I MEAN, THE LAST THING
ON MY MIND RIGHT NOW
IS TRYING TO SELL MYSELF.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.915
WITH EVERYTHING THAT
WENT DOWN WITH MELISSA,

07:06.960 --> 07:08.188
AND TIPPI BEING
BIRDNAPPED.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.858
DON'T EVEN BRING UP
THAT SINGING CANARY.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.152
PARROT.
WHATEVER.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.794
WE DON'T HAVE THE BIRD
OR THE BEAST.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.650
NOW THAT MELISSA'S GONE,
WE HAVE VERY LITTLE TO GO ON.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.668
WELL, IF MELISSA WAS TELLING
THE TRUTH ABOUT ANYTHING,

07:16.700 --> 07:18.065
THEN WE SHOULD BE
FOLLOWING THE ALI TRAIL.

07:18.100 --> 07:19.567
AND THAT TRAIL ENDS
WITH "BOARD SHORTS."

07:19.600 --> 07:20.794
AND OUR ONLY WAY
OF FINDING HIM

07:20.840 --> 07:21.966
WAS THROUGH TIPPI'S
PHONE NUMBER.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.069
I'VE ALREADY SPENT DAYS

07:23.110 --> 07:24.134
RESEARCHING THAT
STUPID NUMBER.

07:24.170 --> 07:26.638
I CAN'T FIND A SINGLE THREAD
THAT LINKS WILDEN, IAN,

07:26.680 --> 07:27.874
OR GARRETT TO YORK COUNTY.

07:29.110 --> 07:30.805
HOLD UP.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.569
WAIT, THERE'S A COLLEGE THERE,
I JUST SAW IT.

07:34.820 --> 07:36.173
CICERO.
CICERO COLLEGE.

07:36.220 --> 07:38.085
IS THERE A CONTACT NUMBER?

07:38.120 --> 07:39.485
YEAH.

07:41.860 --> 07:43.725
THAT'S INTERESTING.

07:43.760 --> 07:45.125
YEAH.
WHAT?

07:46.860 --> 07:47.724
YEAH, LOOK.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.728
THE AREA CODE
AND THE PREFIX ARE THE SAME.

07:52.870 --> 07:55.566
LOOKS LIKE WE JUST
GOT A LITTLE CLOSER.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.202
HEY!

07:58.240 --> 08:00.105
HEY.
HI.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.801
I CAME TO GRAB YOU FOR LUNCH,

08:01.840 --> 08:02.841
BUT HACKETT SAID
YOU WERE LEAVING EARLY.

08:02.880 --> 08:03.904
SHOULD I REWORRIED?

08:03.950 --> 08:06.100
I'M WAS JUST GOING TO
STOP BY THE BREW TO SEE ZACK.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.744
OH, OKAY.
COOL.

08:08.780 --> 08:10.247
SO, HOW'S THE TRIP
PLANNING GOING?

08:10.290 --> 08:11.939
YOU BET ON HOW MUCH
SCHNITZEL YOU CAN EAT

08:11.990 --> 08:13.287
BEFORE YOU'RE
CRAVING A PATTY MELT?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.709
NOT EXACTLY...

08:15.760 --> 08:18.149
I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO TO TELL
HIM THAT THE TRIP IS OFF.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.188
WHAT? WHY?

08:21.230 --> 08:22.925
DID YOU GUYS GET
IN A FIGHT?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.267
NO, NO. NOTHING LIKE THAT.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.267
IT'S JUST, UM...

08:25.300 --> 08:27.962
I JUST CHANGED MY MIND.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.201
HOLD IT.
LIKE TWO DAYS AGO

08:31.240 --> 08:32.901
YOU WERE MODELING
THERMALS AND MOON BOOTS.

08:32.940 --> 08:34.009
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:34.040 --> 08:35.598
I...

08:35.640 --> 08:37.744
I CAME TO MY SENSES.

08:39.050 --> 08:40.119
I GOTTA GO.

08:42.220 --> 08:44.142
MOM.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.179
MOM, WAIT.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.551
DID SOMEBODY...

08:50.590 --> 08:52.990
SAY OR DO SOMETHING THAT
WOULD MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.691
ACTUALLY, YES.

08:54.730 --> 08:56.960
I HAD A LONG TALK
WITH YOUR BROTHER

08:57.000 --> 08:59.298
AND HE'S JUST NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH ME LEAVING.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.139
WHAT?

09:01.170 --> 09:02.159
OH, PLEASE.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.804
MOM, MIKE CAN
TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.570
YOUR BROTHER'S STILL NOT
RECOVERED FROM ME MOVING OUT.

09:06.610 --> 09:10.068
AND PUTTING AN OCEAN IN BETWEEN
US IS NOT EXACTLY IDEAL.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.941
WHAT? WHAT? WHAT
ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

09:13.980 --> 09:15.914
IS THAT A FLY OR A BEE?

09:15.950 --> 09:18.089
IT'S A BEE.
OPEN YOUR WINDOW.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.653
SEE? THIS IS WHY I CAN'T
MOVE 5,000 MILES AWAY.

09:23.690 --> 09:24.759
LOOK, WE'RE NOT
LOSING YOU FOREVER.

09:24.790 --> 09:25.984
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.122
MIKE CAN DEAL WITH IT.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.798
ARIA, I CAN'T DISCUSS
THIS RIGHT NOW.

09:28.830 --> 09:31.799
BUT WE WILL TALK ABOUT IT
TOMORROW AT FAMILY NIGHT, OKAY?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.866
OKAY.

09:50.990 --> 09:54.050
( phone ringing )

09:58.130 --> 10:00.121
( buzzing )

10:15.280 --> 10:17.271
( screaming )

10:18.880 --> 10:21.872
Aria: MOM! MOM!

10:31.760 --> 10:33.296
SHE'S GOING TO BE
OKAY, RIGHT?

10:33.330 --> 10:34.729
Aria: YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.421
THEY PUT HER ON SOME
ANTI-INFLAMMATORIES.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.724
I'M THE ONE WHO NEEDS
A SHOT OF SOMETHING.

10:38.770 --> 10:39.839
I'M FREAKING OUT.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.189
CAN YOU TRY AND TALK
TO YOUR MOM?

10:41.240 --> 10:42.707
CAN YOU EXPLAIN--

10:42.740 --> 10:43.764
EXPLAIN WHAT, EM?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.869
THAT "A" GAVE HER
FOUR-WHEEL HIVE?

10:45.910 --> 10:48.333
I JUST... I HAVE TO
GET HER OUT OF TOWN

10:48.380 --> 10:49.335
BEFORE "A" DECIDES TO UNLEASH

10:49.380 --> 10:51.701
THE REST OF THEIR EVIL ARK.
( phone beeps )

10:51.750 --> 10:53.240
HEY, IT'S MY MOM'S DOCTOR
ON THE OTHER LINE.

10:53.280 --> 10:54.212
I GOTTA GO, OKAY?

10:54.250 --> 10:55.444
OKAY. GIVE HER
MY BEST, OKAY?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.913
YEAH.

11:08.230 --> 11:09.219
ARE YOU BRENDAN?

11:09.260 --> 11:12.297
YEAH... SPENCER?

11:12.330 --> 11:13.729
NO. I'M EMILY.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.431
SHE'S RUNNING A LITTLE LATE.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.734
AH.

11:17.770 --> 11:19.032
HOW'D YOU GUESS?

11:19.070 --> 11:20.708
WAS IT THE LARGE,
SCARY LOOKING BINDER?

11:20.740 --> 11:22.139
YEP. YEAH AND, UH...

11:22.180 --> 11:23.306
COMPANY NAME IS ON IT.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.874
( both chuckle )

11:24.910 --> 11:25.979
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?

11:26.010 --> 11:27.739
UH, NO THANKS. I'M GOOD.

11:30.250 --> 11:31.911
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING RUDE,

11:31.950 --> 11:33.781
WHAT IS IT THAT
YOU ACTUALLY DO?

11:33.820 --> 11:36.209
WELL, I HELP APPLICANTS
PUT THEIR BEST FOOT FORWARD

11:36.260 --> 11:37.784
AND TRY TO GET THEM FACE-TIME

11:37.830 --> 11:39.229
WITH PEOPLE WHO
CAN CHAMPION THEM.

11:39.260 --> 11:41.194
RIGHT.

11:41.230 --> 11:43.289
BUT HONESTLY,
MOST OF MY WORK IS EMOTIONAL.

11:43.330 --> 11:46.128
PEOPLE GET CRAZED
THROUGH THIS PROCESS,

11:46.170 --> 11:47.990
THEY NEED SOMEONE TO HELP
THEM OVER THE HOT COALS.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.338
YEAH, I GET THAT.

11:50.370 --> 11:52.304
I WAS READY TO SWIM
MY WAY INTO STANFORD

11:52.340 --> 11:53.830
BEFORE MY SHOULDER
GOT BUSTED.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.303
SO, NOW I DON'T
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.807
WELL, IF I WERE YOUR ADVISOR,

11:57.850 --> 11:59.147
I'D FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO RE-BRAND YOU.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.109
HOW DID YOU GET INTO ALL THIS?

12:02.150 --> 12:05.187
I MEAN, YOU LOOK LIKE YOU
JUST GRADUATED YOURSELF.

12:05.220 --> 12:07.780
IT'S A FAMILY BUSINESS,
SO I TRAINED EARLY.

12:07.820 --> 12:10.823
BUT THANKS FOR NOTICING
THAT I'M NOT COLLECTING
SOCIAL SECURITY YET.

12:10.860 --> 12:11.827
( chuckles )

12:11.860 --> 12:14.021
EVERY TIME I WALK
THROUGH A HIGH SCHOOL DOOR

12:14.060 --> 12:15.459
WITH A BLAZER AND TIE

12:15.500 --> 12:17.320
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT AS WELL
BE GRANDPA MUNSTER.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.099
( laughs )

12:19.130 --> 12:22.133
LOOK, IF YOU WANT...

12:22.170 --> 12:24.502
I COULD GO THROUGH SOME
OF THESE SCHOOLS WITH YOU.

12:24.540 --> 12:27.338
AT LEAST UNTIL
SPENCER SHOWS UP.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.871
YEAH. YEAH,
THAT'D BE GREAT.

12:35.580 --> 12:39.209
THANKS FOR AGREEING
TO DO THIS.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.515
I DIDN'T WANT ANYONE SEEING
ME COME TO YOUR OFFICE.

12:42.560 --> 12:45.427
ASHLEY, WHAT DID YOU COME
HERE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT?

12:45.460 --> 12:48.224
WILDEN.
DARREN WILDEN.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.458
I WANT TO TELL YOU
MY SIDE OF THE STORY.

12:54.140 --> 12:56.961
UNLESS YOU THINK
YOU ALREADY KNOW.

12:57.010 --> 13:01.276
I'VE--I'VE HEARD SOME RUMORS,
BUT...

13:01.310 --> 13:03.505
LOOK, I HAVE TO ASK
THIS AS A FORMALITY,

13:03.550 --> 13:05.404
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME
AS YOUR FRIEND

13:05.450 --> 13:06.542
OR AS YOUR LAWYER?

13:06.580 --> 13:09.879
HOPEFULLY BOTH.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.286
I-I THINK THE POLICE ARE
BUILDING A CASE AGAINST ME.

13:12.320 --> 13:13.389
WELL, LET ME LOOK INTO IT.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.854
I'VE GOT A CONTACT
AT ROSEWOOD PD.

13:17.960 --> 13:20.019
AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.527
WHAT?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.462
IF I'M GUILTY?

13:26.070 --> 13:28.038
I'LL CALL MY CONTACT.

13:28.070 --> 13:30.129
YOU SIT TIGHT UNTIL THEN, OKAY?

13:33.440 --> 13:35.533
VERONICA, I...

13:35.580 --> 13:37.571
I HAVE SOME SKELETONS
IN MY CLOSET.

13:37.610 --> 13:41.341
AND I JUST DIDN'T
WANT YOU TO BE SURPRISED.

13:42.380 --> 13:44.814
NOTHING SURPRISES ME ANYMORE.

13:46.150 --> 13:48.584
YOU NEED TO COVER YOUR BASES.

13:48.620 --> 13:50.850
I WOULD START
WITH THESE THREE.

13:50.890 --> 13:53.199
PLUS DAVOREN HAS
A POLYNESIAN STUDIES MAJOR.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.448
ARE YOU... HAWAIIAN?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.968
UH, FILIPINO, KOREAN,
IRISH, SCOTTISH.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.434
YEAH, BUT I'M NOT
REALLY INTERESTED

14:00.470 --> 14:01.596
IN POLYNESIAN STUDIES,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.505
I WANT TO MAJOR IN BIOLOGY.

14:03.540 --> 14:06.202
WELL, THERE'S NO HARM
IN FAKING IT

14:06.240 --> 14:07.332
FOR A LITTLE WHILE
THOUGH, RIGHT?

14:07.380 --> 14:09.905
( chuckles )

14:09.950 --> 14:11.349
Spencer: BRENDAN?
YEAH.

14:11.380 --> 14:13.211
I'M SPENCER.
SO SORRY I'M LATE.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.639
NO PROBLEM.
YOUR FRIEND IS GREAT COMPANY.

14:15.680 --> 14:16.886
NO, STAY.

14:20.620 --> 14:23.623
SO, I'VE GOT THIS WEEKEND'S
CAMPUS VISIT TO BROWN SET.

14:23.660 --> 14:26.049
YEAH, I WAS LOOKING OVER THAT
LIST OF STUFF YOU GAVE ME,

14:26.090 --> 14:28.229
AND I THINK I ACTUALLY
WANT TO CHECK OUT CICERO.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.659
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

14:29.700 --> 14:30.894
CICERO WASN'T EVEN ON YOUR LIST.

14:30.930 --> 14:33.933
I UNDERSTOOD FROM YOUR MOM THAT
WE WERE FOCUSING ON THE IVIES.

14:33.970 --> 14:36.632
YEAH, BUT IT NEVER HURTS
TO HAVE A SAFETY SCHOOL, RIGHT?

14:36.670 --> 14:38.968
SURE.

14:39.010 --> 14:42.070
WE'LL POSTPONE BROWN.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.941
WHY DON'T WE MEET
AT CICERO TOMORROW MORNING?

14:43.980 --> 14:45.208
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU
TO THE HEAD OF--

14:45.250 --> 14:48.139
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING THAT
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO BY MYSELF.

14:48.180 --> 14:50.216
YOU KNOW, TO GET A REAL FEEL
FOR THE PLACE.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.686
I THINK OUR TIME WOULD BE
BETTER SPENT MEETING WITH
SOME DEPARTMENT HEADS.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.553
THE DIRECTOR OF ADMISSIONS
HAPPENS TO BE A FAMILY FRIEND.

14:56.590 --> 14:57.682
OH.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.358
UH, DO YOU THINK CICERO
WOULD BE A GOOD FIT FOR ME?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.527
YEAH. YEAH.

15:02.560 --> 15:03.993
YOU SHOULD TOTALLY COME.

15:04.030 --> 15:05.019
I'LL DRIVE BOTH OF US.

15:07.170 --> 15:08.194
( chuckles )

15:10.040 --> 15:12.600
( beeping )

15:15.140 --> 15:16.573
I DON'T KNOW.
LIKE A MINUTE AGO.

15:16.610 --> 15:18.475
WHERE'S DAD?

15:18.510 --> 15:20.671
HE'S OUT.
HOW'S MOM?

15:20.720 --> 15:22.415
PUFFY.
CAN WE TALK?

15:22.450 --> 15:23.542
LATER, OKAY?

15:23.590 --> 15:26.081
I'M CRUSHING THIS LEVEL.

15:26.120 --> 15:27.155
WHAT THE HELL?!

15:27.190 --> 15:28.088
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO MOM

15:28.120 --> 15:29.280
TO MAKE HER CHANGE
HER MIND ABOUT EUROPE?

15:29.320 --> 15:31.151
GIVE THAT BACK TO ME.
STOP.

15:31.190 --> 15:33.590
DON'T YOU EVEN CARE THAT
SHE'S IN BED RIGHT NOW

15:33.630 --> 15:35.689
COVERED IN LIKE FIVE LAYERS
OF CALAMINE LOTION!

15:35.730 --> 15:37.027
OF COURSE I DO.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.697
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH EUROPE?

15:38.730 --> 15:41.039
NOTHING, I...

15:41.070 --> 15:43.402
LOOK, MIKE, MY POINT
IS YOU'RE BEING SELFISH.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.431
OKAY, YOU'RE SITTING HERE
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

15:45.470 --> 15:47.028
WHILE SHE'S TRYING
TO FIGHT HER SWELLING DOWN--

15:47.080 --> 15:48.206
SHE SAID SHE NEEDED TO REST!

15:48.240 --> 15:49.207
AND YOU WON'T LET
HER LEAVE FOR A TRIP.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.049
HOW IS THAT BEING SELFISH?

15:51.080 --> 15:52.445
BECAUSE YOU ONLY
WANT HER AROUND

15:52.480 --> 15:54.016
TO HOLD YOUR HAND WHILE
YOU'RE WRITING A PAPER.

15:54.050 --> 15:55.312
EXCUSE ME?

15:55.350 --> 15:57.386
I LIKE HAVING MOM HERE.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.688
WHY ARE YOU TRYING
TO SHIP HER OFF?

16:00.720 --> 16:02.358
'CAUSE I CARE ABOUT
HER HAPPINESS, THAT'S WHY.

16:02.390 --> 16:03.254
TRY YOUR OWN.

16:03.290 --> 16:05.258
THE ONLY REASON YOU
WANT HER TO GO SO BAD

16:05.290 --> 16:07.099
IS SO YOU CAN START
BOFFING YOUR TEACHER AGAIN.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.537
IT'S HARD TO GET FRISKY
WITH FITZ

16:14.570 --> 16:16.458
WHEN SOMEONE'S LOOKING OVER
YOUR SHOULDER, HUH?

16:36.220 --> 16:37.619
HAN NA?

16:37.660 --> 16:39.252
CAN YOU HELP ME
WITH THESE, PLEASE?

16:44.400 --> 16:47.597
SO, I HEARD SOME KIDS
FROM SCHOOL

16:47.640 --> 16:50.234
ARE GOING ON CAMPUS VISITS
THIS WEEKEND.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.339
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO GO?

16:51.370 --> 16:52.667
WELL, I DON'T REALLY LIKE

16:52.710 --> 16:54.268
WHEN THE TOUR GUIDES
WALK BACKWARDS.

16:54.310 --> 16:55.231
IT MAKES ME NAUSEOUS.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.175
ESPECIALLY IF THEY'RE
WEARING PLEATED JEANS.

16:59.210 --> 17:01.542
FINE, HAN NA.

17:01.580 --> 17:03.787
I DON'T NEED TO LOOK
AT COLLEGES.

17:03.820 --> 17:06.516
I ALREADY KNOW
WHERE I WANNA GO.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.814
WELL, UNTIL YOU GET INTO
THE FASHION INSTITUTE,

17:08.860 --> 17:10.555
YOU MIGHT WANT TO HAVE
SOME OTHER CHOICES.

17:10.590 --> 17:15.050
( phone ringing )

17:15.100 --> 17:16.453
HELLO?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.524
HI.

17:18.770 --> 17:19.691
NO, I CAN TALK.

17:19.730 --> 17:23.530
I JUST DIDN'T EXPECT
TO HEAR FROM YOU SO SOON.

17:23.570 --> 17:25.663
CAN YOU HANG ON A SECOND?

17:25.710 --> 17:28.474
I GOT YOU THE RICE SALAD
YOU LIKE.

17:28.510 --> 17:31.172
UM, START WITHOUT ME,
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

17:42.660 --> 17:44.150
Ashley: I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:44.190 --> 17:47.125
HOW BAD IS IT?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.297
Veronica: YOU SHOULD
COME TO MY OFFICE

17:53.700 --> 17:54.689
OKAY, SO I KNOW THAT THEY'RE
DIVORCED AND EVERYTHING,

17:55.740 --> 17:57.833
BUT DO YOU THINK YOUR DAD
WOULD COVER FOR YOUR MOM

17:57.870 --> 17:59.303
IF SHE WAS IN SERIOUS TROUBLE?

17:59.340 --> 18:01.331
HI.
GOOD MORNING.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.301
I NEVER WENT TO BED.

18:02.340 --> 18:04.479
DO YOU THINK YOUR DAD
WOULD STILL PUT HIMSELF

18:04.510 --> 18:06.705
ON THE LINE FOR YOUR MOM
IF SHE REALLY NEEDED IT?

18:06.750 --> 18:08.615
UM...

18:08.650 --> 18:09.639
I DON'T KNOW, HAN.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.114
YEAH, I MEAN,
I THINK HE WOULD.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.617
WHY? DID YOU
CALL YOUR DAD?

18:15.660 --> 18:17.855
NO, I DON'T KNOW
IF I SHOULD.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.118
I MEAN, WHAT IF CALEB'S RIGHT?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.821
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH
MY DAD TO HELP

18:20.860 --> 18:22.896
AND THEN HIM JUST
GO THE OTHER WAY.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.568
YEAH, WELL, WHY AREN'T
YOU WAKING UP CALEB?

18:24.600 --> 18:25.862
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE TRIED?

18:25.900 --> 18:27.231
HE'S CAMPING WITH HIS DAD.

18:27.270 --> 18:28.396
THE CLOSEST THING
HE HAS TO A PHONE

18:28.440 --> 18:30.567
IS AN EMPTY CAN OF BEANS.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.501
WHAT EXACTLY BROUGHT
ALL OF THIS ON?

18:34.540 --> 18:36.178
HER MUDDY SHOES, THEY'RE GONE.

18:36.210 --> 18:37.643
THEY'RE NOT UNDER THE SINK.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.147
DO YOU THINK
THAT "A" TOOK THEM?

18:39.180 --> 18:40.738
NO, THEY'RE PROBABLY
JUST IN HER CLOSET.

18:40.780 --> 18:41.872
DID YOU LOOK THERE?

18:43.520 --> 18:44.885
IT'S LOCKED.

18:44.920 --> 18:47.286
GOD, THIS IS SO WEIRD,
SHE NEVER LOCKS HER CLOSET.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.914
WELL, SHE PICKED
A GOOD TIME TO START.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.279
I GOTTA GO.

18:51.330 --> 18:53.548
OKAY, JUST CHECK IN
WITH ME LATER, OKAY?

18:53.600 --> 18:55.295
BYE.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.764
HEY, YOU NEED ME TO DROP
YOU OFF AT SPENCER'S?

19:00.800 --> 19:03.633
OH, I'M GOOD.
SHE'S COMING TO PICK ME UP.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.542
HERE.

19:13.580 --> 19:16.310
WHAT'S THIS?

19:16.350 --> 19:19.217
GAS MONEY.
AND A LITTLE EXTRA.

19:21.490 --> 19:24.687
WELL, I WANT YOU TO ENJOY
YOURSELF THIS WEEKEND.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.619
TAKE SPENCER OUT
FOR A PIZZA, MY TREAT.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.457
I'M GOOD.
I GOT PAID YESTERDAY.

19:29.500 --> 19:30.489
THEN TAKE IT,

19:30.530 --> 19:32.919
AND BUY YOURSELF SOMETHING
YOU ORDINARILY WOULDN'T.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.232
YOU KNOW?

19:34.270 --> 19:36.192
HANDBAG...

19:36.240 --> 19:38.208
I DON'T KNOW.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.332
THAN KS.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.774
HI.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.309
HOW'S SHE DOING?

19:56.360 --> 19:58.828
SHE'S FINE.

19:58.860 --> 20:01.693
SHE'S JUST TIRED
FROM THE MEDICATION.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.688
UMM...

20:05.730 --> 20:07.231
ARE YOU GOING TO GO SEE HER?

20:07.270 --> 20:08.862
YES, I WAS PLANNING TO LATER.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.606
WELL, COULD YOU
SOONER THAN LATER?

20:11.870 --> 20:12.962
SHE NEEDS YOU.

20:13.010 --> 20:14.739
UH, NO SHE DOESN'T.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.975
SHE NEEDS YOU TO TELL
HER TO GO TO EUROPE.

20:17.010 --> 20:18.807
I DO, TOO.

20:20.650 --> 20:23.483
ARIA, ARE YOU ASKING ME
TO CONVINCE YOUR MOTHER

20:23.520 --> 20:25.738
TO RUN OFF WITH
HER NEW BOYFRIEND?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.328
WELL, THAT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.282
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT ME TO DO THAT?

20:32.330 --> 20:33.558
BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

20:33.600 --> 20:35.329
WHAT SHE'S GIVING UP
IF SHE DOESN'T GO.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.624
WOULDN'T YOU MISS HER?

20:38.930 --> 20:42.229
YES, SO MUCH.

20:44.610 --> 20:45.838
LOOK SHE'S ONLY STAYING HERE

20:45.870 --> 20:47.576
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
THAT SHE HAS TO.

20:47.610 --> 20:50.306
AND YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO CAN RELEASE HER FROM THAT.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.499
ARIA...

20:52.550 --> 20:53.949
YOUR MOTHER IS A GROWN WOMAN

20:53.980 --> 20:56.642
WHO CAN MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.758
LOOK, I KNOW THAT THIS
IS A REALLY STRANGE REQUEST.

21:02.790 --> 21:05.657
BUT SHE VALUES YOUR OPINION.

21:05.690 --> 21:08.420
AND SHE STILL CARES A LOT ABOUT
WHAT YOU THINK OF HER.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.378
Brendan: OUR FIRST STOP TODAY
IS A REGENTS' TEA.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.945
HEAD OF THE HUMANITIES
DEPARTMENT'S GONNA BE THERE,

21:30.990 --> 21:34.653
SO IF YOU CAN CASUALLY SLIP
IN A REFERENCE TO KIERKEGAARD,

21:34.690 --> 21:35.952
YOU'LL MAKE HIS HEART
GO PITTER-PAT.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.719
YEAH.
YOU KNOW THOSE
SORORITY SCHOLARSHIPS

21:37.760 --> 21:39.387
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER?
YEAH.

21:39.430 --> 21:40.658
HOW DO I GET ONE OF THOSE?

21:40.700 --> 21:42.452
DO THEY REQUIRE POM-POMS?

21:42.500 --> 21:44.889
Brendan: NO, BUT
THERE ARE CERTAIN STEPS

21:44.930 --> 21:48.730
YOU COULD TAKE TO HELP
YOURSELF GET NOTICED.

21:48.770 --> 21:50.829
I'D BE HAPPY TO TALK
MORE ABOUT IT.

21:50.870 --> 21:52.599
MAYBE OVER A MEAL?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.301
YEAH, SURE.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.045
I'LL GET OUR BADGES.
COOL.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.509
OKAY, I THINK YOU
CAN DIAL IT BACK.

22:02.550 --> 22:05.383
HE DOESN'T NEED TO BELIEVE
THAT WE ACTUALLY WANT
TO GO TO THIS PODUNK SCHOOL.

22:05.420 --> 22:07.809
I JUST NEED YOU TO HELP ME
DISTRACT HIM LONG ENOUGH,

22:07.860 --> 22:09.851
SO THAT WE CAN TRACK DOWN THE
NUMBER THAT ALI KEPT CALLING.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.380
HEY, SPENCER, I --

22:11.430 --> 22:12.920
HE'S GONNA COME BACK ANY SECOND.
SO, HERE'S THE PLAN.

22:12.960 --> 22:14.518
I'M GONNA UP JAR JAR BINKS

22:14.560 --> 22:15.754
AND I NEED YOU TO OCCUPY BRENDAN

22:15.800 --> 22:17.495
AT S'MORES WITH
BORES OR WHATEVER.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.862
FIRST CHANCE YOU GET,
BRUSH HIM OFF,
MEET ME BACK HERE.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.458
GOT IT?

22:21.500 --> 22:22.660
YEAH, OKAY.

22:23.840 --> 22:24.864
READY TO GO?

22:24.910 --> 22:27.435
YEAH, ACTUALLY
I NEED TO FRESHEN UP.

22:27.480 --> 22:29.607
SO, I'M JUST GONNA
HEAD BACK OVER TO THE HOTEL,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.505
AND I WILL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS LATER, OKAY?

22:31.550 --> 22:32.642
OKAY.
OKAY.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.045
TA- DA.
GREAT.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.469
( line ringing )

23:38.510 --> 23:39.738
Aria: HI, IT'S ARIA.

23:39.780 --> 23:41.179
LEAVE A MESSAGE,
I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.939
( beep)

23:47.960 --> 23:50.986
( phone ringing )

23:51.030 --> 23:52.088
HELLO?

23:52.130 --> 23:53.529
OH, THANK GOD.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.925
HANNA, NOW'S NOT
THE TIME, OKAY?

23:54.960 --> 23:56.825
I NEED ANSWERS FROM A GUY
WHO SPENDS HIS WEEKENDS

23:56.860 --> 23:57.827
PRETENDING TO BE A HUFFLEPUFF.

23:57.870 --> 23:59.167
I'VE GOT TO FOCUS HERE.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.566
NO, SPENCER. I'M BUGGING OUT
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

24:01.600 --> 24:03.534
I WENT SNOOPING THROUGH
MY MOM'S CLOSET,

24:03.570 --> 24:04.605
LOOKING FOR THE SHOES.

24:04.640 --> 24:07.029
HANNA, WILL YOU PLEASE LEAVE
YOUR POOR MOTHER ALONE.

24:07.070 --> 24:09.675
YOU ALREADY GAVE HER A
BRITNEY SHEARS IN YOUR DREAM,

24:09.710 --> 24:10.972
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU GOING
TO DO TO THAT WOMAN?

24:11.010 --> 24:12.204
LOOK, I'VE GOTTA GO.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.218
THE NUMBER THAT ALI KEPT
CALLING IS IN THIS AREA CODE.

24:14.250 --> 24:15.615
IF WE CAN FIND BOARD SHORTS,

24:15.650 --> 24:16.742
WE CAN FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALI.

24:16.780 --> 24:17.986
WISH ME LUCK.
NO!

24:18.020 --> 24:20.716
SPENCER, WAIT!
1--

24:53.590 --> 24:54.682
HI.

24:57.260 --> 24:59.478
I LOVE YOUR SHIRT.

25:01.860 --> 25:02.827
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

25:02.860 --> 25:04.828
I WAS JUST WONDERING

25:04.870 --> 25:06.690
IF YOU COULD TELL ME

25:06.730 --> 25:09.290
WHOSE NUMBER THIS IS.

25:09.340 --> 25:12.207
THERE'S AN AUTOMATED DIRECTORY
RIGHT OVER THERE.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.107
OKAY, BUT EVEN THOUGH
IT'S A CAMPUS NUMBER,

25:15.140 --> 25:16.607
IT'S ACTUALLY UNLISTED.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.143
I KNOW, RIGHT?

25:19.180 --> 25:21.273
IF IT'S UNLISTED,
I DON'T HAVE IT EITHER.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.742
I CAN'T HELP YOU.

25:22.780 --> 25:23.986
YOU CAN'T?

25:24.020 --> 25:25.578
OR YOU WON'T?

25:26.850 --> 25:29.318
LOOK MAN, I TOTALLY
GET IT, OKAY?

25:29.360 --> 25:31.885
YOU SHALL NOT PASS.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.899
THE THING IS,
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

25:36.930 --> 25:37.999
SO PLEASE?

25:38.030 --> 25:40.999
FOR ALL I KNOW THAT NUMBER
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST ANYMORE.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.769
IT TOTALLY EXISTS.
I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHERE.

25:42.800 --> 25:44.131
WHY?
IT'S PERSONAL.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.161
YOU TRYING TO TRACK DOWN AN
OLD BOYFRIEND OR SOMETHING?

25:46.210 --> 25:47.905
NO, WHY WOULD YOU
EVEN THINK THAT?

25:47.940 --> 25:49.601
I KNOW GIRLS LIKE YOU.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.039
YOU GOT THE CRAZY EYES.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.048
THEY'RE NOT THAT CRAZY.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.638
CRAZY ENOUGH.

25:57.850 --> 25:59.340
FINE, LET ME SEE THAT THING.

25:59.390 --> 26:00.482
THANK YOU.

26:00.520 --> 26:04.149
ALL RIGHT, THE FIRST THREE
NUMBERS MEANS IT'S ON CAMPUS,

26:04.190 --> 26:07.318
AND THE NEXT THREE NUMBERS
MEANS IT'S ON GREEK ROW.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.452
REALLY?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE?

26:08.500 --> 26:12.061
NO, AT LEAST IT GIVES THE POOR
BASTARD A FIGHTING CHANCE.

26:13.770 --> 26:15.192
A LAN NISTER ALWAYS
PAYS HIS DEBTS.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.060
YOU WOULD LIKE THE LANNISTERS.

26:17.100 --> 26:19.307
I COULD GIVE YOU
THE ENTIRE TARGARYEN SPEECH

26:19.340 --> 26:21.274
FROM THE END OF SEASON ONE,
BUT I WILL NOT WASTE MY BREATH.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.372
SO, HOW IS IT?

26:24.410 --> 26:25.604
IT'S PRETTY GNARLY.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.379
BUT I DECIDED
TO TAKE A GAMBLE

26:27.410 --> 26:29.674
AND REJOIN THE HUMAN RACE.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.212
WELL, YOU DON'T LOOK... BAD.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.717
COMPARED TO WHAT?

26:34.760 --> 26:36.284
BLEU CHEESE?

26:37.390 --> 26:40.029
UM, I SPOKE WITH MIKE
THIS Al-TERNOON.

26:40.060 --> 26:44.224
OH, UM, BYRON,
IT'S A NON-ISSUE.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.830
AND HE UNDERSTANDS THAT
YOU NEED THIS TIME AWAY.

26:46.870 --> 26:49.031
SINCE WHEN?

26:49.070 --> 26:51.664
SINCE I SPOKE WITH HIM.

26:51.710 --> 26:54.076
THIS IS SILLY.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.975
I'M THE PARENT OF TWO TEENAGERS.

26:56.010 --> 26:57.102
IT'S MY JOB.

26:57.140 --> 26:59.347
AND I CAN COVER YOUR SHIl-T.

26:59.380 --> 27:03.316
CLOCK SOME OVERTIME,
STEAL SOME PAPERCLIPS.

27:03.350 --> 27:05.841
WHY?

27:05.890 --> 27:09.109
BECAUSE YOU HAVE SPENT
YOUR ENTIRE ADULT LIFE

27:09.160 --> 27:10.286
TAKING CARE OF OTHER PEOPLE.

27:10.320 --> 27:13.699
ME BEING ONE OF THEM.

27:13.730 --> 27:16.198
AND IT IS TIME FOR YOU
TO DO SOMETHING FOR YOURSELF.

27:16.230 --> 27:17.299
AND YOU DON'T THINK
IT MAKES ME,

27:17.330 --> 27:19.764
LIKE, THE WORST MOTHER
OF THE YEAR?

27:19.800 --> 27:21.734
ELLA...

27:21.770 --> 27:23.362
YOU AND I TALKED
ABOUT MOVING TO EUROPE

27:23.400 --> 27:25.004
WHEN WE WERE STILL IN COLLEGE.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.258
AND THEN ARIA HAPPENED.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.834
THEN MIKE.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.006
THEN A MORTGAGE.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.201
AND ICELAND DOESN'T COUNT.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.138
YOU WERE BUSY TAKING CARE
OF TWO TEENAGERS

27:34.180 --> 27:37.741
AND ONE NUTTY PROFESSOR.

27:37.790 --> 27:41.180
YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN
A SECOND CHANCE.

27:41.220 --> 27:43.950
TAKE IT.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.053
( indistinct shouting )

27:49.100 --> 27:50.249
LOOK, I'M SORRY, OKAY?

27:50.300 --> 27:51.858
I LOST TRACK OF TIME.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.458
WHATEVER. IT'S FINE.
FORGET IT.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.161
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS WE FIGURED OUT THAT

27:55.200 --> 27:57.134
THE NUMBER ON ALI'S LOOP
IS HERE SOMEWHERE.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.263
AND THAT "BOARD SHORTS"
WAS PROBABLY SOME FRAT BOY

27:59.310 --> 28:01.699
SHE WAS HAVING OVERNIGHTS WITH.

28:01.740 --> 28:03.776
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE WORN
SOMETHING MORE LADYLIKE.

28:03.810 --> 28:05.346
DOES THIS DRESS
LOOK SLUTTY TO YOU?

28:05.380 --> 28:07.245
NOT REALLY.

28:07.280 --> 28:08.770
BUT THE SLUTTIER THE BETTER.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.708
WE HAVE TO ZERO IN ON
THE SENIOR BROTHERS.

28:10.750 --> 28:12.047
SEE IF ANY OF THEM
REMEMBER ALI

28:12.090 --> 28:13.751
OR WHO SHE WAS HOOKING UP
WITH THAT SUMMER.

28:15.490 --> 28:18.323
LOOK, ARE YOU SURE THAT THIS
SORORITY PARTY IS THE WAY TO GO?

28:18.360 --> 28:20.419
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST KNOCK
ON THE FRAT HOUSE DOORS.

28:20.460 --> 28:21.222
THERE AREN'T THAT MANY OF THEM.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.366
I WANT TO GO
TO THE PARTY, OKAY?

28:25.830 --> 28:26.728
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.328
ALL THE GUYS WILL
PROBABLY BE THERE ANYWAYS.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.804
( shouting )

28:30.840 --> 28:33.809
UGH, LIKE MOTHS
TO THE FLAME.

28:33.840 --> 28:34.829
HERE...

28:37.540 --> 28:38.472
WHAT'S THIS?

28:38.510 --> 28:42.276
EMILY, IT IS A PHOTO,
TO JOG MEMORIES OF ALI.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.118
I THINK THIS WAS WHERE
SHE WAS GOING WITH
THE MONEY FROM HECTOR.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.812
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE GET THERE
WE SHOULD PROBABLY DIWY UP
THE WORKLOAD.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.078
DO YOU WANT TO TALK TO
THE DELTAS OR THE KAPPAS?

28:50.120 --> 28:51.257
NEITHER!

28:51.290 --> 28:52.780
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THIS IS IMPORTANT,

28:52.830 --> 28:54.229
BUT CAN WE PLEASE
PUT A PIN IN THIS?

28:54.260 --> 28:55.488
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THIS TONIGHT.

28:55.530 --> 28:57.794
WHY? THIS IS THE REASON
WE CAME HERE.

28:57.830 --> 28:58.990
NO, IT ISN'T!

28:59.030 --> 29:00.361
I CAME HERE TO TALK
TO SORORITY SISTERS

29:00.400 --> 29:02.095
ABOUT A SCHOLARSHIP.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.164
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,

29:03.200 --> 29:06.761
I ACTUALLY WANT TO GET
INTO THIS "PODUNK" SCHOOL.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.402
SO YOU'RE NOT HERE
TO HELP ME FIND A NUMBER?

29:08.440 --> 29:10.499
NO.
I'M HERE FOR ME.

29:10.540 --> 29:11.848
( laughs )

29:11.880 --> 29:14.246
OKAY, WELL, NOW
IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.145
WHAT MAKES SENSE?

29:16.180 --> 29:19.115
OH, YOU BATTING THOSE
CAMEL LASHES AT BRENDAN.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.084
SMILING, LAUGHING
AT EVERYTHING HE SAYS --

29:21.120 --> 29:22.155
IT'S CALLED BEING NICE.

29:22.190 --> 29:23.555
IT'S CALLED FLIRTING.

29:23.590 --> 29:25.979
I DON'T THINK BRENDAN CONFUSED
INTEREST WITH FLIRTATION.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.452
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I'M NOT CONFUSED ABOUT.

29:27.490 --> 29:29.048
THE FACT THAT ALL WEEKEND

29:29.100 --> 29:31.421
YOU'VE CONVENIENTLY FAILED
TO MENTION THAT YOU'RE GAY!

29:32.530 --> 29:34.066
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.136
I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT
YOU WERE THE TYPE OF PERSON

29:36.170 --> 29:38.035
WHO WOULD LEAD SOMEBODY ON
JUST TO GET WHAT YOU WANTED.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.265
NICE COMING FROM THE GIRL
WHO WHIPPED OFF HER BRA

29:40.310 --> 29:41.902
TO GET BACK ON
THE DECATHLON TEAM.

29:41.940 --> 29:43.271
OKAY, I WASN'T LEADING HIM ON.

29:43.310 --> 29:44.447
I WAS BEING CHARMING!

29:44.480 --> 29:45.879
COULD OF FOOLED ME.

29:45.910 --> 29:46.877
YOU WOULDN'T KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE,

29:46.910 --> 29:48.468
YOU'VE NEVER
HAD TO BE CHARMING.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.839
YOU GET TO ACT
LIKE A TOTAL SNOT-RAG,

29:49.880 --> 29:53.111
'CAUSE MOMMY AND DADDY
HAVE A SAFETY NET OF CASH
TO CATCH YOUR FALL!

29:53.150 --> 29:56.950
* SISTERS OF ZETA CHI

29:56.990 --> 29:59.982
* THE APPLE OF GOD'S EYE

30:02.200 --> 30:05.567

30:19.050 --> 30:20.244
Ashley: HANNA?

30:20.280 --> 30:21.542
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

30:21.580 --> 30:23.241
HI.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.214
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT YOU WERE HOME.

30:25.250 --> 30:28.117
UM, I'M GOING TO MEET
SPENCER AND EMILY.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.048
I WAS JUST GOING TO CALL
YOU FROM THE CAR.

30:30.090 --> 30:33.526
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
THAT REQUIRES LUGGAGE?

30:33.560 --> 30:35.323
A CAMPUS VISIT.

30:35.360 --> 30:36.622
CICERO COLLEGE.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.127
OH.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.627
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED

30:40.670 --> 30:42.968
IN LIBERAL ARTS COLLEGES.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.059
YEAH, WELL, LIKE YOU SAID.

30:45.110 --> 30:48.898
I SHOULD PROBABLY START
THINKING OF OTHER OPTIONS.

30:48.940 --> 30:51.101
HUH.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.072
UM...

30:53.110 --> 30:55.271
I'M JUST GONNA CALL YOU
WHEN I GET THERE, OKAY?

30:56.280 --> 30:57.269
OKAY.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.179
HONEY?

31:15.570 --> 31:16.093
( lively pop music plays )

31:16.900 --> 31:18.629
SO, THE FIRST YEAR
YOU HAVE A COMMUNAL,

31:18.670 --> 31:21.332
BUT Al-TER THAT YOU CAN
PETITION TO GET A SINGLE.

31:21.380 --> 31:23.530
COOL.
SO, HOW DO I APPLY?

31:23.580 --> 31:26.299
WELL, FIRST YOU'LL HAVE TO
MEET WITH ALL THE SISTERS.

31:30.250 --> 31:32.639
OH, THAT.

31:32.690 --> 31:35.352
THAT WAS THE GRUNWALD'S.

31:35.390 --> 31:36.982
WHAT'S A "GRUNWALD"?

31:37.020 --> 31:38.180
MRS. GRUNWALD.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.424
OUR FORMER HOUSE MOTHER.

31:39.460 --> 31:40.654
SHE WAS BEFORE MY TIME,

31:40.690 --> 31:42.920
BUT LEGEND HAS IT
SHE WAS FIRED.

31:42.960 --> 31:44.393
DID IT HAVE
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT?

31:44.430 --> 31:46.591
MAYBE.

31:46.630 --> 31:50.134
APPARENTLY YOU COULDN'T
GET ANYTHING PAST THAT BITCH.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.660
ONE GIRL SAID
IT WAS LIKE

31:51.710 --> 31:52.563
SHE KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SNEAK OUT

31:52.610 --> 31:54.430
BEFORE YOU EVEN GOT
THE IDEA YOURSELF.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.179
( sighs )
ANYWAYS. ..

31:58.210 --> 31:59.279
LET ME SHOW YOU OUR DEN.

31:59.310 --> 32:01.449
WE JUST GOT
A NEW FLAT SCREEN.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.557
( music plays,
indistinct chatter )

32:08.590 --> 32:11.388
EXCUSE ME, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW THIS GIRL WOULD YOU?

32:11.430 --> 32:13.648
UH-UH.
NO?

32:13.690 --> 32:15.624
THAN KS.

32:15.660 --> 32:18.527
SORRY, HEY, DO YOU
HAPPEN TO KNOW THIS GIRL?

32:20.230 --> 32:21.561
OH, THANK YOU.

32:23.340 --> 32:27.299
( indistinct chatter )

32:30.080 --> 32:31.308
HEY.

32:31.350 --> 32:32.339
OH, HEY.

32:32.380 --> 32:33.369
I...

32:33.410 --> 32:35.571
I THINK I JUST SAW SPENCER
IN ONE OF THE ROOMS.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.576
I WASN'T LOOKING FOR SPENCER.

32:37.620 --> 32:39.315
I'M OFF-DUTY FOR THE NIGHT.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.580
OH.

32:41.620 --> 32:44.453
CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

32:44.490 --> 32:45.980
SURE.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.259
HEY.

32:53.300 --> 32:54.528
'SUP?

32:54.570 --> 32:56.060
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU.

32:56.100 --> 32:57.135
COULD YOU LOOK AT THIS PHOTO

32:57.170 --> 32:58.307
AND LET ME KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS GIRL?

32:59.640 --> 33:01.505
YEAH, I'VE
SEEN THIS GIRL.

33:01.540 --> 33:02.609
REALLY?

33:02.640 --> 33:04.301
YEAH, IN MY DREAMS.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.339
OH!

33:05.380 --> 33:06.699
THANK YOU.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.274
MORONS.

33:18.260 --> 33:19.227
Hanna: SPENCER!

33:19.260 --> 33:20.284
HAN NA?

33:20.330 --> 33:21.297
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

33:21.330 --> 33:23.252
LOOKING FOR YOU!
WHERE'S EMILY?

33:23.300 --> 33:24.722
I HAVE NO IDEA.

33:24.770 --> 33:25.759
WELL, DIDN'T YOU
COME TOGETHER?

33:25.800 --> 33:27.119
YEAH, THOUGHT SO.

33:27.170 --> 33:29.195
WELL, I NEED
BOTH OF YOU NOW.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.389
WHY?

33:32.640 --> 33:34.176
HANNA,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.406
WHAT?

33:41.520 --> 33:43.249
IS THAT REAL?

33:43.280 --> 33:44.713
WHY WOULD YOU BRING A GUN
TO A SORORITY PARTY?

33:44.750 --> 33:46.240
BECAUSE IT'S THE GUN.

33:46.290 --> 33:47.643
THAT KILLED WILDEN.

33:47.690 --> 33:48.588
AT LEAST I THINK IT IS.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.759
WHY DO YOU HAVE THAT?!
BECAUSE I FOUND IT.

33:50.790 --> 33:52.257
IN MY MOM'S CLOSET.

33:52.290 --> 33:53.382
I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT.
GET RID OF IT?

33:53.430 --> 33:55.421
HANNA, NO, YOU HAVE TO GIVE
IT BACK TO YOUR FATHER.

33:55.460 --> 33:57.394
AND LET MY DAD TURN MY MOM
IN TO THE COPS? NO WAY.

33:57.430 --> 33:58.397
I DON'T THINK HE'D TO THAT.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.227
I'M NOT GIVING HIM
THE CHOICE.

34:00.270 --> 34:02.397
IT'S BETTER TO DUMP IT HERE,
MILES AWAY FROM ROSEWOOD.

34:02.440 --> 34:03.668
THAT WAY WHEN
THE POLICE QUESTION HIM,

34:03.700 --> 34:04.667
HE'S NOT GONNA
KNOW THE ANSWERS.

34:04.710 --> 34:05.631
AND HE WON'T HAVE TO LIE.

34:05.670 --> 34:07.661
OKAY. LOOK, HANNA,
JUST WAIT HERE, PLEASE?

34:07.710 --> 34:08.677
LET ME GO FIND EMILY.

34:08.710 --> 34:09.779
NO, I DON'T
WANT TO HOLD THIS.

34:09.810 --> 34:12.142
NO, HANNA. JUST STAY HERE.
OKAY? PLEASE DON'T MOVE.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.499
DON'T DO ANYTHING,
UNTIL I GET HER.

34:13.550 --> 34:15.438
AND WE'LL GO TOGETHER
TO YOUR FATHER'S.

34:15.480 --> 34:17.448
OKAY? WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT,
THE THREE OF US.

34:17.480 --> 34:19.186
OKAY. PLEASE JUST HURRY.

34:19.220 --> 34:20.209
OKAY.

34:26.790 --> 34:29.691
HEY, EXCUSE ME.
SORRY, HAVE YOU SEEN EMILY?

34:29.730 --> 34:31.698
WHAT?
MY FRIEND EMILY,
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

34:31.730 --> 34:35.268
UM, SHE WENT THAT WAY,
WITH SOME GUY.

34:42.740 --> 34:46.744
( music continues )

34:46.780 --> 34:49.112
EMILY?

34:49.150 --> 34:50.617
( girls laughing )

34:50.650 --> 34:52.208
EM?

34:59.360 --> 35:01.521
EM?

35:10.370 --> 35:12.167
EM?!

35:17.380 --> 35:20.872
( giggling )

35:20.910 --> 35:22.719
HEY, HAVE YOU GUYS--

35:22.750 --> 35:24.547
OW!

35:54.950 --> 35:56.372
HELLO?

36:06.290 --> 36:07.689
HELLO?

36:13.500 --> 36:16.936
( radio turns on )

36:18.570 --> 36:19.605
( radio stops )

36:34.860 --> 36:36.851
( dial tone )

36:39.830 --> 36:42.958
SO, ME AND DAD
AGAINST YOU AND MOM?

36:43.000 --> 36:44.661
FINE.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.224
( phone ringing )
Ella: OKAY.

36:46.270 --> 36:47.396
GAME ON. LET'S GO.

36:54.710 --> 36:56.928
WHO IS THIS?

37:04.690 --> 37:05.247
OKAY, SPENCER,
SLOW DOWN.

37:06.390 --> 37:09.450
IT'S LIKE SOME KIND OF
PANIC ROOM OR BUNKER
OR SOMETHING.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.481
WHY WOULD THE PHONE NUMBER
LEAD THERE?

37:11.530 --> 37:12.849
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE...

37:12.890 --> 37:15.688
MAYBE ALI SPENT SOME
TIME HIDING OUT HERE.

37:15.730 --> 37:17.789
BUT SOMEONE WAS
PICKING UP THAT LINE.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.866
ALI WAS NOT CALLING HERSELF.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.697
OKAY, BUT WHY WOULD
BOARD SHORTS NEED TO GO

37:21.740 --> 37:24.334
TO A SORORITY HOUSE
TO ANSWER HIS CALLS?

37:24.370 --> 37:25.462
( muffled laughter)

37:25.510 --> 37:26.602
LOOK, I HAVE TO GO, OKAY?

37:26.640 --> 37:28.733
I HAVE TO GO FIND
EMILY AND HANNA.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.599
HAN NA?

37:29.640 --> 37:30.971
WHAT THE HELL
IS HANNA DOING THERE?

37:31.010 --> 37:31.999
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.540
BYE.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.369
DUDE, I SCORED
A TOUCHDOWN, MAN!

37:59.410 --> 38:00.502
IT WAS AWESOME!

38:00.540 --> 38:02.974
( indistinct chatter )

38:03.010 --> 38:04.375
( laughing )
I'M SORRY.

38:14.690 --> 38:15.918
IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO

38:15.960 --> 38:17.587
I'VE ACTUALLY BECOME
A PRETTY GOOD COOK.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.928
( both chuckle )

38:18.960 --> 38:20.052
OH, YOU LOOK OUT.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.398
CAN I GET YOU ANOTHER?

38:21.430 --> 38:24.058
SURE.

38:25.430 --> 38:26.419
EMILY?

38:34.070 --> 38:37.073
( music plays,
indistinct conversations )

38:44.490 --> 38:46.378
EMILY?

38:46.420 --> 38:47.819
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT?

38:47.850 --> 38:51.013
OH, SORRY, I THINK I JUST
SAW ONE OF MY FRIENDS.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.527
YOU LOOK UPSET.

38:52.560 --> 38:55.552
NO, NO, IT'S JUST REALLY
STRANGE THAT SHE'D HERE.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.125
SO, I NEED TO FIND HER
AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

38:58.160 --> 38:59.388
DON'T STRESS.

38:59.430 --> 39:00.465
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

39:02.600 --> 39:04.431
UM...

39:04.470 --> 39:06.700
I'M SORRY, BRENDAN.

39:06.740 --> 39:08.139
YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY GREAT GUY,

39:08.170 --> 39:11.845
BUT I THINK I MAY HAVE GIVEN
YOU THE WRONG IMPRESSION.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.700
OKAY.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.047
I'M NOT AVAILABLE.

39:15.080 --> 39:16.570
I'M WITH SOMEONE.

39:16.620 --> 39:19.589
MAYBE HE'S NOT MAKING
YOU HAPPY ANYMORE.

39:19.620 --> 39:20.848
HE'S A SHE.

39:20.890 --> 39:22.448
AND SHE'S AMAZING.

39:22.490 --> 39:24.629
SORRY.

39:24.660 --> 39:27.549
HUH.

39:27.590 --> 39:31.424
I'LL STILL HELP YOU FIND
YOUR FRIEND, IF YOU WANT.

39:31.470 --> 39:34.735
IT'S PRETTY DARK OUT HERE,
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DRINKING.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.135
THESE PARTIES
CAN GET A LITTLE...

39:36.170 --> 39:38.138
OUT OF CONTROL.

39:38.170 --> 39:41.731
I'LL BE FINE.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.652
( music continues in distance )

40:05.530 --> 40:06.667
HAN NA?

40:08.800 --> 40:09.789
( footsteps approaching )

40:09.840 --> 40:11.193
HANNA, IS THAT YOU?

40:11.240 --> 40:15.006
( footsteps continue )

40:19.150 --> 40:20.902
( twig snaps )

40:29.620 --> 40:32.623
( indistinct shouting )

40:41.800 --> 40:43.131
HAN NA!

40:43.170 --> 40:44.933
HELLO?

40:44.970 --> 40:47.461
( footsteps continue )

40:52.250 --> 40:55.139
( twigs snapping )

40:55.180 --> 40:57.011
WHO IS THAT?

40:57.050 --> 40:58.745
TELL ME WHO YOU ARE!

41:01.990 --> 41:03.457
( twigs snapping )

41:27.680 --> 41:29.773
( both shouting )

41:29.820 --> 41:32.618
WELCOME TO COLLEGE, PRE-FROSH!

41:51.640 --> 41:53.130
Spencer: EMILY!

41:53.170 --> 41:55.001
WHERE'S HANNA?
I DON'T KNOW.

41:55.040 --> 41:56.837
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?
WE NEED TO FIND HER,

41:56.880 --> 41:59.007
BEFORE SHE DOES
SOMETHING REALLY STUPID.

42:08.660 --> 42:09.718
Man: HOLD IT!

42:09.760 --> 42:12.752
DON'T MOVE!

42:12.790 --> 42:13.950
GET DOWN ON THE GROUND,

42:13.990 --> 42:15.628
PUT YOUR HANDS IN FRONT OF YOU!

42:17.160 --> 42:19.025
Man over radio:
SUSPECT '5 LAST NAME IS MARIN,

42:19.070 --> 42:20.025
FIRST NAME HANNA.

42:20.070 --> 42:21.025

42:21.070 --> 42:21.991
Woman: COPY THAT.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.167
( indistinct radio transmission
conﬁnues)

42:24.200 --> 42:26.760
( indistinct murmuring )

42:27.940 --> 42:29.805
Man: BACK UP. BACK UP.
MAKE SOME ROOM.

42:31.610 --> 42:32.747
HAN NA, WAIT!

42:32.780 --> 42:34.042
HAN NA!
BACK UP, LADIES.

42:34.080 --> 42:35.547
POLICE BUSINESS.

42:41.350 --> 42:44.729
