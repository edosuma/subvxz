WEBVTT

00:14.140 --> 00:16.176
The trash goes
in the incinerator.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.673
Then the steam is
converted to electricity.

00:18.750 --> 00:21.344
Helps power New York City.
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.420 --> 00:23.149
Yeah. Real cool, Dad.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.438
Look, "Take your daughter
to work" day wasn't my idea.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.182
I'll be right back.
Don't touch anything.

00:51.610 --> 00:53.077
Have a great day.
Thanks.

00:53.150 --> 00:55.209
CARRIE: Hey.
Oh, morning, Carrie!

00:57.350 --> 00:59.045
How are you, Deedie?
How did you do on your exam?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.680
B-plus. That memory thing
you taught me really helped.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.978
I'll never be able
to get those formulas
out of my brain.

01:04.060 --> 01:05.288
Welcome to my world.

01:05.360 --> 01:06.520
Large skinny
mocha, please.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.329
DEEDIE: You got it.

01:10.730 --> 01:13.836
Excuse me, but I couldn't help
noticing your eyes.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.561
They're so...
Luminous?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.631
That's exactly what
I was going to say.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.371
Look at us,
on the same page already.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.328
Well, a man who notices
a woman's eyes...

01:21.410 --> 01:23.071
You must be
a real romantic.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.175
We're a dying breed.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.878
How about I take
you to dinner?

01:27.950 --> 01:30.316
That sounds so nice.

01:30.390 --> 01:31.743
Will Cindy
be joining us?

01:32.390 --> 01:33.618
Sorry?

01:33.690 --> 01:35.419
Cindy, your wife,

01:35.490 --> 01:37.355
who you married
two months ago
to this very day?

01:37.430 --> 01:38.556
Oh, I'm divorced now.

01:38.630 --> 01:39.619
Wow, that was fast.

01:41.300 --> 01:42.892
You should probably take
your wedding ring off, then.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.319
I, uh...

01:45.400 --> 01:47.391
In fact, I remember your
wedding was in the boathouse
in Central Park,

01:47.470 --> 01:50.701
overlooking the swans,
because swans mate for life,

01:50.770 --> 01:53.102
the symbolism of which
was apparently lost on you.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.171
I'm sorry.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.003
I had no idea you
were Cindy's friend.

01:57.080 --> 01:58.547
Oh!
Look, I was just,

01:58.610 --> 02:00.544
you know,
talking to you.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.349
I was just checking
my market value for Cindy.

02:02.420 --> 02:06.311
You were making sure
you were still attractive
to Cindy by hitting on me?

02:06.390 --> 02:07.789
Wow, what a thoughtful
husband.

02:07.860 --> 02:10.727
Cindy is a luclq,
luclq girl.

02:10.790 --> 02:13.623
Exactly. This was
completely innocent.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.520
Maybe don't tell her.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.797
Maybe stop hitting on people
when you're married, okay?

02:18.870 --> 02:21.395
I won't. I will.

02:21.470 --> 02:22.539
Keep the change.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.534
You're not really going
to tell Cindy, are you?

02:26.610 --> 02:28.498
Oh, I've never
met Cindy.
What?

02:28.580 --> 02:31.572
It's really sad. I read
the Sunday Times wedding
announcements every week,

02:31.650 --> 02:34.016
and, you know,
I remember everything.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.583
Cindy and Larry Carlin
of Montauk.

02:36.650 --> 02:39.517
Can't get any of the sappy
details out of my head.

02:39.590 --> 02:42.115
Thank you.
No, no, no.
It's on Larry.

02:42.190 --> 02:45.023
Larry's a generous guy,
isn't he?
He sure IS.

02:51.670 --> 02:55.436
Okay, so our Jane Doe is
Dr. Norah Al-Bayati, age 33,

02:55.500 --> 02:57.559
the only child
of Iraqi refugees.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.733
Cause of death?
We don't know yet.

02:59.810 --> 03:00.936
Delina's still
working on It.

03:01.010 --> 03:02.375
What do we know
about her?

03:02.450 --> 03:04.907
She got a full scholarship
to MIT at 16 years old.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.448
Got her PhD
by the time she was 24.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.681
Worked in the public
and private sector...

03:09.750 --> 03:11.741
in R&D for _
aerospace companies,

03:11.820 --> 03:14.152
as_a consultant
for military contracts,

03:14.220 --> 03:16.484
lead researcher
at Hudson UnIverSIty,

03:16.560 --> 03:18.983
where she also taught
aeronautical engineering.

03:19.060 --> 03:21.528
Wow, impressive.
High achiever.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.795
Which makes it
that much weirder.
I'm not following.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.589
In the week leading
up to her death,

03:26.670 --> 03:29.309
she had no phone calls,
no emails, nothing.

03:29.370 --> 03:31.031
And that wasn't
the first time
that it happened.

03:31.110 --> 03:34.136
This disappearance act
happened several times
in the past six months.

03:34.210 --> 03:37.600
An overachiever randomly
and periodically
falls off the grid.

03:39.110 --> 03:41.112
Maybe Norah was
leading a double life.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.619
Mr. and Mrs. Al-Bayati,
we're very sorry
for your loss.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.282
And thank you for
agreeing to let us

03:49.360 --> 03:50.952
take a look at your
daughter's place.

03:51.030 --> 03:52.258
Of course.
Oh, I'm sorry...

03:52.330 --> 03:54.059
Sit, please.
Thank you.

03:56.330 --> 03:59.731
So I understand your
daughter was a very
talented engineer.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.166
Oh, yes, ever since
she was a child.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.937
Planes, helicopters...
Anything that went
up in the air.

04:06.010 --> 04:07.875
MOTHER: Norah got
a scar on her forehead

04:07.940 --> 04:11.068
when she jumped off the couch
when she was four.

04:11.150 --> 04:15.371
It broke her heart
when she realized
that she couldn't fly.

04:15.450 --> 04:18.487
Can you tell me about what
your daughter was up to
these past few weeks...

04:18.550 --> 04:19.915
Anything out
of the ordinary?

04:19.990 --> 04:22.049
Well, it's hard
to know.

04:22.120 --> 04:25.351
Norah worked on projects
that she couldn't talk about.

04:25.430 --> 04:28.991
She had signed papers,
nondisclosure agreements.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.699
Yeah, she took them
very seriously.
Yeah.

04:31.770 --> 04:34.261
Oh, my God, her cat.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.501
We'll have to take her.

04:38.170 --> 04:41.139
Norah was very excited

04:41.210 --> 04:43.405
about the project that
she was working on.

04:43.480 --> 04:45.846
She couldn't say
anything about it,

04:45.910 --> 04:49.846
but she told us that it was
the opportunity of a lifetime.

04:51.650 --> 04:55.108
Uh, she said that
she would be gone weeks,

04:55.190 --> 04:58.079
maybe months,
if everything worked out.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.199
She have a boyfriend?
Was she romantically
involved with anyone?

05:02.260 --> 05:07.493
Norah was very private
about her personal life,

05:07.570 --> 05:10.437
uh, as most children
are with their parents.

05:10.510 --> 05:12.933
But there was that man
who came by.

05:13.010 --> 05:14.432
He was looking
for Norah.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.829
He came around
a couple months ago.

05:15.910 --> 05:18.174
Yes, yes, he was drunk.
I remember him.

05:18.250 --> 05:22.380
He was very upset.
He said that Norah
was ruining his life,

05:22.450 --> 05:24.338
and when I asked
Norah about it,

05:24.420 --> 05:25.944
she said not to worry,

05:26.020 --> 05:30.150
that he was another professor
just jealous over her work.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.527
Did you get a name?

05:31.590 --> 05:34.024
No.
No, but he was
in his 405.

05:34.100 --> 05:37.069
He was maybe overweight,
had a beard.

05:37.130 --> 05:39.860
And he had a white stripe
in his hair.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.737
Yes, like a skunk.

05:47.340 --> 05:51.049
Okay, so we're looking
for a Professor Gordon Dawes.

05:51.110 --> 05:53.510
Overweight aerospace professor
who looks like a skunk.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.548
Can't be too
many of those.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.012
Uh, Professor Dawes?

05:58.090 --> 05:59.751
Yeah, right there, man.
Thanks.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.285
Office hours
are at 3:00.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.726
Dawes? Police.
We need to talk to you.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.058
I did go by her
parents' place.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.937
How come?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.503
Well, I was up
for tenure, again,

06:16.570 --> 06:18.606
and I didn't get it,
again.

06:18.670 --> 06:22.447
Aerospace positions
are difficult to come by.

06:22.510 --> 06:26.742
Norah was on the selection
committee, and I was upset.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.344
Why, she didn't
vote for you?

06:28.420 --> 06:30.581
As a matter of fact,
no, she didn't.

06:32.150 --> 06:35.051
I shouldn't have gone by.
I was drunk.

06:35.120 --> 06:38.283
It's one of many regrets
I have in my life.

06:38.360 --> 06:39.850
You care to share
any other regrets?

06:39.930 --> 06:42.967
_How much
time you got?

06:45.170 --> 06:49.561
I was... Devastated
about what happened to Norah.

06:49.640 --> 06:50.902
She was a good friend.

06:50.970 --> 06:53.677
Even though she rejected
your tenure?

06:53.740 --> 06:55.571
Sounds like she had
some kind of pull on you.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.877
There was nothing
going on with Norah.

06:59.950 --> 07:01.645
Seems like you wish
there had been.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.711
Well...

07:05.150 --> 07:07.948
She wasn't into guys.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.557
You know, not that I would've
had a chance with her, anyway.

07:10.630 --> 07:12.518
She was...

07:12.600 --> 07:14.556
She was way
out of my league.

07:14.630 --> 07:16.564
Any idea who was
in her league?

07:16.630 --> 07:19.690
Well, yeah,
there was this one woman

07:19.770 --> 07:23.001
who, um, pursued her
like a pro...

07:23.070 --> 07:26.403
Uh, wine, flowers,
weekend getaway.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.835
Any idea
who this suitor was?

07:28.910 --> 07:32.846
Oh, no, I prefer not to know
who my competition is.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.775
We'll need to know
what you've been up to
these past few days.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.147
You think you can
get that to us?

07:37.220 --> 07:39.017
Oh, well, that won't
be difficult.

07:39.090 --> 07:43.322
You know, if I'm not here,
I'm at Rudy's Tavern
on 112th and Lexington.

07:43.390 --> 07:45.620
They can tell you.

07:45.690 --> 07:47.692
It's the longest
relationship I've had.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.765
Hey, Delina.
Hey.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.138
So what have we got?

07:53.200 --> 07:56.089
Based on rigor,
she died probably
about 72 hours ago,

07:56.170 --> 07:57.831
which means sometime
Friday afternoon,

07:57.910 --> 07:59.878
but the cause of death
is what got me beat.

07:59.940 --> 08:01.407
What do you mean?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.175
Well, she has a contusion
on the back of her head here,

08:03.250 --> 08:05.309
but it's not serious enough
to be the cause of death.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.847
She was naked
when she was found

08:06.920 --> 08:08.239
but no signs
of sexual assault.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.345
No gunshot wounds,
no lacerations,

08:10.420 --> 08:12.183
no injection points,
nothing.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.150
So we have no idea
what killed her?

08:14.220 --> 08:15.289
Tox screens will be
back tomorrow.

08:15.360 --> 08:16.554
Maybe that'll
give us something.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.656
As soon as they come in,
you call me, okay?
All right.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.921
All right,
what have you found?

08:24.000 --> 08:26.798
So off of that tip we got
from Professor Dawes,

08:26.870 --> 08:29.168
I looked into
all the deliveries
that Norah received

08:29.240 --> 08:31.868
while she was at
Hudson UniverSIty,
and most recently,

08:31.940 --> 08:35.501
she got a large package
from a place called
Stalwart Vineyards.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.548
At first, I didn't
think too much of it

08:37.610 --> 08:39.976
but then did some
digging,

08:40.050 --> 08:42.177
and guess who owns
Stalwart Vineyards.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.842
VVho?
Joyce Chen.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.083
Wait, Joyce Chen,
the billionaire
who created VistaView?

08:47.160 --> 08:50.288
The very same.
Guess what else I found.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.918
Ran Norah's
credit cards...

08:53.930 --> 08:55.955
And that weekend getaway
the professor
was talking about

08:56.030 --> 08:58.294
was to Joyce's Napa Valley
vineyard retreat,

08:58.370 --> 08:59.837
on her private jet.

08:59.900 --> 09:03.631
Wow. Dawes had no idea how
out of his league Norah was.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.928
And being in a relationship
with Joyce

09:06.010 --> 09:08.205
might not have been
a good thing for Norah.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.840
Joyce had
a pretty bad reputation
for some nasty breakups.

09:10.910 --> 09:13.470
You know the model
Christina Rodriguez?

09:13.550 --> 09:15.677
Well, apparently, they dated,
and when Christina left her,

09:15.750 --> 09:17.479
she got into this
really bad car accident...

09:17.550 --> 09:21.088
The circumstances of which,
very suspicious.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.129
_I think I know
just the person
to pay Joyce a visit.

09:27.330 --> 09:28.797
Kick.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.067
Carrie Wells.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.937
You spoke to my partner,
Al Burns, on the phone.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.069
Yeah, I'll give you
five minutes.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.630
Then I got a call
with Abu Dhabi.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.268
Okay.

09:39.340 --> 09:41.638
What was your relationship
with Norah Al

09:41.710 --> 09:43.678
Sure.
I don't have one.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.401
Really?
'Cause I heard
you took her away

09:46.480 --> 09:48.869
for a romantic weekend
at your Vineyard.

09:48.950 --> 09:50.679
Yeah, she's not my type.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.786
I'm more into models,
not nerds.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.511
And... Maybe cops.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.387
Oh.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.382
_You were interested
in her, weren't you?

09:59.460 --> 10:00.825
Professionally...

10:00.900 --> 10:04.324
I was trying to persuade her
to join my aerospace R&D team.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.890
And how did that
work out for you?

10:05.970 --> 10:09.906
She turned me down,
but Norah and I
parted ways amicably.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.801
You don't strike me
as the kind of woman

10:11.870 --> 10:14.430
who takes "no" amicably.

10:14.510 --> 10:16.205
Norah will come around.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.477
I tend to get what
I want in the end.

10:19.550 --> 10:20.949
So do I,
and what I want

10:21.020 --> 10:23.045
is to know who murdered
Norah Al-Bayati.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.439
Wait, Norah's dead?

10:25.890 --> 10:27.255
Interesting.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.254
Yeah, you seem
all broken up about it.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.753
I could pretend to be,

10:30.830 --> 10:32.695
but my real emotion
is relief.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.955
She's not working
for somebody else.
Wow.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.627
Now, if you'll excuse me.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.165
Nice left hook.

10:42.840 --> 10:44.034
Thanks.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.159
So, uh, she actually,
you know...

11:01.220 --> 11:02.482
Hit on you?

11:02.560 --> 11:05.085
No, I never said
she hit on me, okay?

11:05.160 --> 11:08.049
I said it was
more of a...VIbe.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.189
I don't know,
it was just a...
Ooh.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.999
Okay, you,
back to the case.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.197
You're like a teenager.
Focus, talk to me.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.807
Right, okay, right.
So, uh...

11:16.870 --> 11:19.100
Friday afternoon,
Joyce had a presentation

11:19.170 --> 11:20.603
for over 200 employees
in Hartford,

11:20.680 --> 11:21.931
so she doesn't look good
for Norah's murder.

11:22.010 --> 11:24.808
This came for you.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.371
"A beautiful red
for a beautiful red."

11:27.450 --> 11:29.884
Oh, boy.
"Hope to have
a taste myself."

11:29.950 --> 11:31.884
Oh, man!

11:31.950 --> 11:34.214
So, if there were
any lingering doubt,
Carrie,

11:34.290 --> 11:36.110
Joyce Chen
totally wants you.

11:36.190 --> 11:37.953
Or she totally wants
to not go to jail.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.658
Or she totally wants me!
Back to the case.

11:40.730 --> 11:42.652
Right, Joyce's alibi
checks out.

11:42.730 --> 11:43.958
Bringing us
back to square one.

11:44.030 --> 11:45.566
Not necessarily.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.565
When I was talking to Joyce,
she said...

11:48.640 --> 11:51.632
She was relieved
that Norah was dead,

11:51.710 --> 11:53.029
which is horrible,
I know,

11:53.110 --> 11:55.578
and she said it was because
she didn't want Norah

11:55.640 --> 11:57.471
working for one
of her competitors.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.700
What if Norah
was already working

11:59.780 --> 12:01.042
for one of her
competitors?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.212
Who have we got?

12:02.280 --> 12:04.339
Well, how about
these guys?

12:04.420 --> 12:09.312
Let me introduce you to
Meredith Hubert, Avra Feld,
and Phineas Capitan.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.857
Now, for the past decade,
these four have been

12:10.930 --> 12:12.124
neck and neck in
a technology race,

12:12.190 --> 12:13.726
and they've been
playing dirty...

12:13.800 --> 12:16.155
Corporate espionage,
poaching talent from
each other's teams.

12:16.230 --> 12:18.198
What kinds of projects
have they been competing on?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.192
Well, most recently,
they've been competing

12:20.270 --> 12:22.659
to create a pressurized suit
that would allow someone

12:22.740 --> 12:26.039
to free-fall
at supersonic speeds
from the edge of space.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.873
And the winner was...

12:27.940 --> 12:30.272
Avra Feld's SkyDive.

12:32.310 --> 12:35.313
MOTHER: Norah worked
on projects that she
couldn't talk about.

12:39.620 --> 12:42.828
Norah had a cap with
that same logo on it
in her apartment.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.248
She was working
for Avra Feld.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.925
And if Feld thought
Norah was jumping ship
to Joyce's crew,

12:49.000 --> 12:50.968
he may have killed
to protect his secrets.

12:51.030 --> 12:52.839
Let's go talk
to Avra Feld.

12:56.040 --> 12:57.564
AL: Thanks for
talking to us, Mr. Feld.

12:57.640 --> 13:00.803
We just want to ask you
a few questions about
Norah Al-Bayati.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.370
Norah Al

13:02.440 --> 13:04.271
It seems she might
have worked for you.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.908
I've got thousands of people
that work for me.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.948
I can't keep track
of them all.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.147
I was named Forbes' Most
Influential Businessman

13:10.220 --> 13:12.108
last year, if you
happen to recall.

13:12.190 --> 13:14.750
I do happen to recall.
And it was Forbes'
Most Influential Techies,

13:14.820 --> 13:17.323
and you were number two
underneath Joyce Chen.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.028
If you're looking
for a list of my employees,

13:19.090 --> 13:20.455
you can talk
to my secretary.

13:20.530 --> 13:23.192
No, we know your
employees sign NDAs,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.295
so chances are,
if Norah worked here,

13:25.370 --> 13:28.237
your secretary would have
no record of that.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.858
Then we're done here,
detectives.

13:35.140 --> 13:38.109
MOTHER: Norah worked
on projects that she
couldn't talk about.

13:38.180 --> 13:40.876
She had signed papers,
nondisclosure agreements.

13:42.920 --> 13:44.239
Oh, my God, the cat.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.651
Oh, my God.

13:52.730 --> 13:54.823
You're planning some kind
of mission to Mars,

13:54.900 --> 13:58.768
specifically to the volcano
Arsia Mons,

13:58.830 --> 14:00.263
and Norah was
helping you.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.133
That's an interesting theory,

14:04.210 --> 14:07.429
except the technology
to go to Mars is years away.

14:07.510 --> 14:09.330
That's what you want
your competitors to believe,

14:09.410 --> 14:10.900
but Norah's parents
told us

14:10.980 --> 14:13.119
that she was excited
about a prOJect at work,

14:13.180 --> 14:15.319
that it was going to take her
away for a few months.

14:15.380 --> 14:18.781
You know what I think?
I think she was helping you
fast-track the technology,

14:18.850 --> 14:20.784
and she was training
to go on the mission.

14:20.860 --> 14:21.986
This is absurd.

14:22.060 --> 14:24.119
When Joyce started
showing interest in Norah,

14:24.190 --> 14:26.556
maybe you killed her to
protect your little secret.

14:26.630 --> 14:29.849
Maybe one of my competitors
is trying to set me up
to take the blame here.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.364
Either way, you can direct
all future questions

14:32.430 --> 14:35.490
to my lawyer, Clay Hibbard
at Berkowitz and Etz.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.265
Great. We're so sorry
to have bothered you.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.762
You know what, though,
I think this is going to make

14:38.840 --> 14:40.637
an awesome story
for the press,

14:40.710 --> 14:43.201
and the thing is,
I love to be in the press.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.874
It's true. She does.
I do. I really do.

14:45.950 --> 14:47.076
You don't have
anything.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.516
An insider tip
from a well-known cop

14:49.580 --> 14:51.548
is gonna open
Pandora's box for you.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.656
So either you
start helping us,

14:53.720 --> 14:56.985
or I'm going to call
the press and share
my "theories."

14:59.230 --> 15:01.494
Okay.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.596
I am planning a mission
to Mars, and...

15:05.030 --> 15:06.566
Norah was gonna go.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.065
So Carrie and I
had to twist his arm,

15:12.140 --> 15:14.529
but Mr. Feld finally
told us about his plans.

15:14.610 --> 15:15.736
Uh-huh.

15:15.810 --> 15:19.007
It seems he's got
a secret training facility

15:19.080 --> 15:21.241
in a warehouse
in Yonkers

15:21.320 --> 15:23.788
that simulates
the conditions on Mars.

15:23.850 --> 15:26.580
Mars. You gotta
be kidding.

15:26.650 --> 15:28.288
Right now, he has
seven candidates.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.658
They've been participating
in a series of lockdowns

15:30.730 --> 15:33.153
to prepare for
an eventual mission.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.152
Norah was
one of the seven.

15:35.230 --> 15:38.597
Well, then, that explains her
mysterious time off the grid.

15:38.670 --> 15:41.537
Mmm-hmm, they were
locked in last week,
got out Friday,

15:41.600 --> 15:42.931
had a furlough
over the weekend,

15:43.010 --> 15:45.763
and started a new lockdown
at 6:00 this morning.

15:45.840 --> 15:50.539
Boy, you two really
got Mr. Feld to talk.

15:50.610 --> 15:52.373
I'm hoping you did this
by the book.

15:52.450 --> 15:56.147
Always. "By the book" is
Carrie's middle name.
Mmm-hmm.

15:56.220 --> 15:59.144
So are the candidates
in this facility monitored?

15:59.220 --> 16:01.450
Is there a camera?
Only on the out5ide.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.885
Jay's going through
the footage,

16:02.960 --> 16:05.281
trying to find any signs
of Norah's movements.

16:07.030 --> 16:08.019
Mars.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.521
Mars.

16:15.500 --> 16:18.264
Talk to me.
So I got those
test results back.

16:18.340 --> 16:20.103
Norah's
cause of death...

16:20.180 --> 16:22.068
Carbon dioxide
p0isoning.

16:22.140 --> 16:25.200
She suffocated on C02?
Exactly.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.441
This is going to sound
like something out of
a sci-fi film, okay,

16:27.520 --> 16:28.976
but just bear with me.
Okay.

16:29.050 --> 16:31.189
Avra Feld, that big tech guy
we've been talking to...

16:31.250 --> 16:33.514
He_ has a_secret_ _
Mars Simulation faCIlity.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.911
I kind of bullied him
into telling me.

16:35.990 --> 16:39.756
And guess what the atmosphere
of Mars consists of mostly.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.559
Carbon...
BOTH: Dioxide.

16:41.630 --> 16:44.292
Exactly. Now you said
she died last Friday.
Yeah.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.395
That facility was
on lockdown.

16:46.470 --> 16:48.438
No one coming in,
no one going out,

16:48.500 --> 16:50.365
_ which means
if she was murdered,

16:50.440 --> 16:52.169
someone on
the inside did it.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.208
And that narrows down
our list of suspects.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.838
Yes, it does.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.542
CARRIE: Norah never
left your facility,
at least not alive.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.453
Which means Norah's killer
is one of the six
other candidates.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.714
But now that
they've started,

17:08.790 --> 17:10.621
I can't interrupt
the lockdown.

17:10.690 --> 17:12.453
The candidates have
already begun isolation

17:12.530 --> 17:14.122
for_the next
training period.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.997
It would compromise
the entire...
You know what I think?

17:16.060 --> 17:18.858
I think that you don't want
anyone in your facility

17:18.930 --> 17:21.137
digging around that
might expose your secrets.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.599
That's assuming
that your theory

17:22.670 --> 17:24.661
has any connection
to reality.

17:36.150 --> 17:38.789
You know what does _have
a connection to reality?

17:38.850 --> 17:42.308
Me talking to Joyce Chen
about your reusable rocket.

17:42.390 --> 17:45.553
Nice try. Everyone who's
anyone is trying to develop
a reusable rocket.

17:45.630 --> 17:48.053
Not everybody's doing it using
a nuclear thermal rocket

17:48.130 --> 17:49.654
with a compact fission
reactor core

17:49.730 --> 17:53.439
using 93% enriched
uranium-235 fuel.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.694
How the hell
do you know that?

17:54.770 --> 17:57.466
You're not the only one
with secrets, Mr. Feld.

17:57.540 --> 18:02.079
You should know Joyce Chen
is a little smitten
with my partner here.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.142
More than a little smitten.
She sent me a box of wine.

18:04.210 --> 18:05.609
She's quite
the ladies' lady.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.569
She sent her
a box of wine.

18:08.650 --> 18:11.539
Do you know what that means?
Know what that means?

18:11.620 --> 18:15.158
I'll bet she wants to
talk to my partne
r about your formulas.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.687
That's corporate
espionage.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.284
It would only be
corporate espionage

18:18.360 --> 18:19.827
if we had signed
one of your

18:19.890 --> 18:22.029
ironclad nondisclosure
agreements when we came
to your office, but...

18:22.100 --> 18:24.796
Since we didn't,
if Carrie mentioned
it to her,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.929
it would just be,
I don't know...

18:27.000 --> 18:28.399
Pillow talk.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.869
What do you want?

18:30.940 --> 18:33.306
I want to go in.
Undercover.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.608
What?
What?

18:34.680 --> 18:36.534
What?
It's the best way.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.840
If we pull those
candidates out,
they lavwer up.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.571
Your secrets
are exposed, right?

18:40.650 --> 18:42.914
Now, if I go in
as a candidate,

18:42.980 --> 18:45.380
I can dig around,
find out who the killer is.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.883
It's very Agatha Christie.

18:46.950 --> 18:48.884
Okay, these people have been
in training for months.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.279
What do you think, huh?

18:50.360 --> 18:52.749
You think you can just walk
in there and join the team?

18:52.830 --> 18:55.048
Yeah, I know I can.
I'm kind of a genius.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.166
It's a long story.
He can fill you in.

18:57.230 --> 18:58.458
Listen, you don't
have a choice.

18:58.530 --> 19:00.794
Either I go in,
or we shut you down.

19:03.270 --> 19:04.760
I'll figure something out.

19:04.840 --> 19:06.865
Aw, thank you.
We'll be in touch.

19:11.510 --> 19:13.273
All right.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.511
You can't be serious about
gomg undercover in there.

19:15.580 --> 19:16.945
We'd be locked in
with a killer.

19:17.020 --> 19:19.147
That's exactly
how I like it.

19:19.220 --> 19:20.710
I need you
to convince Russo.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.314
Why am I always
doing your dirty work?

19:22.390 --> 19:23.652
'Cause I love it
when you talk dirty.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.049
Don't be cute.

19:25.130 --> 19:26.688
How'd you pull
all that stuff out?

19:26.760 --> 19:29.524
Uranium-235 fuel,
fission?

19:29.600 --> 19:31.966
I saw a diagram
on his desk.

19:32.030 --> 19:33.634
Wow.
Why so surprised?

19:33.700 --> 19:35.133
I remember crazy stuff
all the time.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.339
It just sounds so...

19:37.410 --> 19:39.366
Say it again.

19:39.440 --> 19:41.931
Compact fission
reactor core

19:42.010 --> 19:46.106
with a 93% enriched
uranium-235 fuel.

19:46.180 --> 19:49.308
God, I love it
when you talk dirty.

19:49.380 --> 19:51.086
All right, listen,
if we pull everyone out,

19:51.150 --> 19:52.845
you know,
they'll lawyer up

19:52.920 --> 19:54.785
and our investigation
will be stonewalled.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.158
But if we go in there
undercover,

19:57.230 --> 20:00.256
we can find the crime scene,
interact with the candidates,

20:00.330 --> 20:02.389
figure out access,
motives.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.189
Yeah, but don't you think
the candidates are gonna be

20:04.270 --> 20:06.192
suspicious of two
random people

20:06.270 --> 20:07.635
just joining
the lockdown?

20:07.700 --> 20:10.339
Well, yeah, if we go in
as fellow candidates,

20:10.410 --> 20:11.900
but we could go in
as scientists.

20:11.970 --> 20:14.006
If we could tell them
that Feld sent us in

20:14.080 --> 20:16.139
to assess the training
or something like that.

20:16.210 --> 20:19.907
So running tests
and observing people.

20:19.980 --> 20:23.814
Like maybe a psychologist
and a medical expert?

20:23.890 --> 20:25.619
You know, Carrie could be
a psychologist.

20:25.690 --> 20:28.011
Yeah, I mean, obviously,
she could memorize enough

20:28.090 --> 20:29.580
to pass
as a psychologist,

20:29.660 --> 20:31.457
but, um...

20:31.530 --> 20:33.657
There's no way I could
pass as a doctor, so...

20:33.730 --> 20:35.994
No, Delina.
Delina should go.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.192
Delina?

20:38.270 --> 20:40.534
Yeah. Delina has been
through Quantico training
and med school.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.067
But Carrie and I
are a team.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.300
No, this is perfect.

20:43.370 --> 20:44.803
_ You continue _
With your investigation

20:44.870 --> 20:46.462
of the candidates'
backgrounds,

20:46.540 --> 20:48.178
and you get your wish.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.208
Your girl Carrie's
going to Mars.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.612
Not bedtime yet!

21:00.690 --> 21:02.214
But I'm tired.

21:02.290 --> 21:03.552
I've seen you up
way later than this, okay?

21:03.630 --> 21:05.279
Remember last Thursday
at the club?

21:05.360 --> 21:09.057
No, because I blacked out.
And how can you compare
partying at a club

21:09.130 --> 21:10.666
to learning
all of this stuff?

21:10.730 --> 21:12.425
Oh, come on,
we get to pretend
to be other people,

21:12.500 --> 21:13.637
go to Mars,
and catch a killer.

21:13.700 --> 21:14.997
This is way more fun
than a club.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.697
All right. Refocus.

21:16.770 --> 21:18.499
Focus. Drink your coffee.
Got it.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.368
We have six candidates
who were in lockdown
with Norah last week.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.341
First one, Simon Sheffield,
aerospace engineer.

21:24.410 --> 21:26.002
He replaced Norah
in the food chain.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.514
With her out, he's in,
which makes him...

21:28.580 --> 21:30.616
Our prime suspect.
Exactly.

21:30.690 --> 21:34.353
CARRIE: Okay, Mike Wilcox,
mechanical engineer.

21:35.360 --> 21:36.759
And this one is...

21:36.820 --> 21:39.482
DELINA: Kristina Payne,
the other engineer.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.926
See? You're not tired.
You're awesome.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.458
Biologist Beth Leners.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.896
Erica Campbell,
Air Force-trained engineer,

21:47.970 --> 21:53.237
and her counterpart,
Navy-trained Randy Reynolds.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.709
All right.

21:54.780 --> 21:59.103
Behind one of these doors
is a killer.

21:59.180 --> 22:00.670
And we're gonna
catch 'em.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.547
CARRIE: I promise you,
I'll be careful.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.780
I don't like this, Carrie.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.282
You can't even take
your gun With you.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.123
Well, that's because
there's nowhere to hide a gun

22:11.190 --> 22:13.624
in my super-sexy,
skintight Mars jumpsuit.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.122
I'm kidding.

22:15.200 --> 22:17.156
There's no super-sew,
skintight Mars jumpsuit.

22:17.230 --> 22:19.528
But if I take a gun in there,
Al, and someone finds it,

22:19.600 --> 22:20.669
they'll make me as a cop.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.264
I'm not loving this plan.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.830
24 hours and I'm pulling you
out of there.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.708
Admit it, you want to be
in zero gravity with me.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.271
Number seven
on my bucket list.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.171
Number seven?
What's number one?

22:30.240 --> 22:31.605
I'll tell you
when you're out of there,

22:31.680 --> 22:33.819
safe and alive.

22:33.880 --> 22:37.418
I promise you,
I am not gonna get killed

22:37.490 --> 22:40.345
until I know what number one
on your bucket list is.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.291
Part of the simulation
is to have periods

22:48.360 --> 22:50.157
of total isolation
from the outside world.

22:50.230 --> 22:52.198
We're cut off
for 24 hours, got it.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.090
Somebody falls and breaks
a leg or gets sick,

22:54.170 --> 22:56.161
you've got to count
on your team
to see you through it.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.764
Well, I got that covered.
I'm a doctor.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.637
That's the Greenhouse Room
where they cultivate food.

22:59.710 --> 23:01.530
Here's the Atmosphere Room.

23:01.610 --> 23:02.804
This is the Cold Room.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.006
To simulate
the Martian climate,

23:04.080 --> 23:05.479
we keep it super-cooled
at a temperature

23:05.550 --> 23:07.302
of -100 degrees Fahrenheit.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.745
Well, at 100 below,
our body temperature

23:08.820 --> 23:10.845
will reach 65 degrees
in under three minutes.

23:10.920 --> 23:13.286
Game over.
Exactly.

23:13.350 --> 23:14.783
Cold enough for ya'?
That's cold.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.748
You guys
joining the party?

23:16.820 --> 23:18.583
They're here to observe.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.287
Evaluate.
Assess.
We're here to assess.

23:20.360 --> 23:22.794
Since this next phase
will be even more stressful,

23:22.860 --> 23:25.499
I've decided that in-person
evaluations and counseling

23:25.570 --> 23:26.889
will be necessary.

23:26.970 --> 23:29.530
Meet Dr. Bergs
and Dr. Smith.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.205
You'll have plenty of time
to get to know each other.

23:32.270 --> 23:35.603
Now as you know,
Norah didn't
show up yesterday,

23:35.680 --> 23:37.375
and I am sorry to inform you

23:37.450 --> 23:39.771
_ _she will not be
continumg With the program.

23:39.850 --> 23:41.112
WOMAN: Oh, no.
Wait, why?

23:41.180 --> 23:42.272
That's terrible.

23:42.350 --> 23:44.181
Better to lose her now
than discover later

23:44.250 --> 23:45.911
she couldn't hack it.

23:45.990 --> 23:48.413
Dr. Smith,
I'll show you to your pod.

23:48.490 --> 23:50.754
Erica, show
Dr. Bergs to hers.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.458
This was Norah's room.
Now it's all yours.

23:58.530 --> 24:01.237
Need I remind you,
Dr. Smith,

24:01.300 --> 24:03.860
once we go to lockdown,
if anything goes wrong,

24:03.940 --> 24:05.009
you're on your own.

24:05.070 --> 24:06.765
Good luck.

24:06.840 --> 24:08.307
Thanks, man.
Yeah, no problem.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.099
So, just check
the nitrogen output levels

24:11.180 --> 24:12.909
in the Cold Room
at 19:00 hours?

24:12.980 --> 24:14.777
I owe you one.

24:14.850 --> 24:16.477
COMPUTER: Lockdown initiating.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.513
Hey.

24:48.580 --> 24:51.981
What?
God, you gave me a fright.

24:52.050 --> 24:55.349
It's good to know
this pod is as small as mine.

24:55.420 --> 24:58.082
This was her room.
Norah's.

24:59.730 --> 25:01.550
This place is so...

25:01.630 --> 25:02.927
Claustrophobic.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.888
Cut off.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.538
So what do we do now?

25:07.600 --> 25:09.659
Well...

25:09.740 --> 25:12.664
Now we look around
and see if this place

25:12.740 --> 25:14.674
Will give up
any of its secrets.

25:19.950 --> 25:21.747
It's coming
from the Cold Room!

25:23.690 --> 25:25.544
You can't go in there
Without a suit. You'll freeze!

25:25.620 --> 25:27.611
Get us suits.
Get us swts!
Now!

25:38.930 --> 25:40.795
He's dead.

25:40.870 --> 25:42.838
By the angle of his fall
and the crack in his mask,

25:42.900 --> 25:44.538
I can tell
he was hit from behind.

25:49.310 --> 25:50.902
He was murdered.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.107
Someone is picking off
the members of this team,

25:53.180 --> 25:54.408
one by one.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.617
We gotta get
this lockdown lifted

25:55.680 --> 25:56.749
and get everybody out of here.

25:56.820 --> 25:58.981
No, we can't.

25:59.050 --> 26:00.688
We've still got 24 hours.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.785
We have to get
everybody out of here!

26:02.860 --> 26:06.580
Delina, if we don't catch
the killer in 24 hours,
we'll get them all out.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.888
We'll do it
more traditionally.

26:07.960 --> 26:10.019
Until then,
we're locked in.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.864
So we keep our cover,
and we tell everyone

26:12.930 --> 26:16.388
that Simon's_ death
was an aCCIdent.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.332
Okay?

26:19.410 --> 26:20.434
Okay.

26:23.440 --> 26:25.408
There's been
an aCCIdent.

26:25.480 --> 26:27.368
Simon Sheffield is dead.

26:27.450 --> 26:29.771
What?
No, that's impossible.

26:29.850 --> 26:31.989
Okay, wait, wait, everybody,
just hold on a second.

26:32.050 --> 26:35.451
It seems like he didn't
fasten his suit correctly

26:35.520 --> 26:37.829
in the Cold Room,
and,uh".

26:37.890 --> 26:39.027
Yeah, he...

26:39.090 --> 26:40.728
He died of
severe hypothermia.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.261
If any of you would
like grief counseling,

26:46.330 --> 26:48.992
I'm available
one-on-one, or...

26:49.770 --> 26:51.499
Mike

26:54.880 --> 26:57.872
We could talk now,
as a group?

27:00.550 --> 27:04.088
No takers?
Okay, wow, tough bunch.

27:04.150 --> 27:05.549
All right, guys,

27:05.620 --> 27:08.157
well, know that
I'm here, and...

27:09.020 --> 27:10.317
...go about your business.

27:23.070 --> 27:24.606
Hey.

27:24.670 --> 27:26.501
Randy, you okay?

27:26.570 --> 27:27.878
Fine, Doc.

27:29.880 --> 27:31.802
So what goes on in here?

27:32.380 --> 27:33.847
Breathing.

27:33.920 --> 27:35.945
Close the door.
Sure.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.239
Ooh!

27:40.320 --> 27:42.311
This room is airtight,
Which lets us play around

27:42.390 --> 27:43.652
With the Martian
atmosphere in here.

27:43.730 --> 27:47.655
95.3% carbon dioxide
doesn't sound that playful.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.789
Which is why we need this.

27:49.860 --> 27:51.589
It converts C02 to owgen.

27:51.670 --> 27:52.819
Wow.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.698
First, we replicate
Mars' atmosphere.

28:06.280 --> 28:08.840
CARRIE: I'm not a chemical
engineer or anything,

28:08.920 --> 28:13.380
but if that doesn't turn
this C02 into oxygen,

28:13.450 --> 28:14.951
aren't we both gonna die?

28:15.020 --> 28:18.387
Normally we wear
suits When we flood
the room with C02,

28:18.460 --> 28:21.850
but I bet you like
to live on the edge.

28:21.930 --> 28:23.329
Mmm.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.338
Let's get some owgen in here.

28:32.410 --> 28:33.775
Let's do that.

28:45.650 --> 28:48.653
You got a pretty good set
of lungs on you, Doc.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.880
Thank you.

28:49.960 --> 28:51.985
Yours aren't
so bad yourself.

29:00.730 --> 29:03.699
So it's_a small
space in here,

29:03.770 --> 29:05.260
all you guys
locked up together.

29:05.340 --> 29:06.364
Anybody hooking up?

29:06.440 --> 29:07.930
Is that an invitation?

29:08.010 --> 29:10.774
'Cause I know _
the no-fraternization policy.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.340
Grounds for dismissal.

29:12.410 --> 29:14.947
You spend a lot of time
in Norah's pod?

29:15.020 --> 29:16.976
I wasn't in her pod.
Really?

29:17.050 --> 29:19.018
Because I found
a stone just like...

29:19.090 --> 29:23.117
Just like the one on
your bracelet in her room.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.650
I was in there
looking for her notebook,

29:26.730 --> 29:28.095
Where she_wrote
down her ideas,

29:28.160 --> 29:30.253
and I thought that
ifI could just read it,

29:30.330 --> 29:32.560
then maybe I could
get an advantage.

29:32.630 --> 29:33.961
Why

29:34.040 --> 29:36.429
I don't know.
I never found it.

29:36.500 --> 29:39.833
I swear, please,
just don't tell Feld.

29:39.910 --> 29:43.801
I'm here for counseling
and support, that's all.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.676
That's all.

29:45.750 --> 29:47.741
To evaluate, so, uh,

29:47.820 --> 29:53.247
you know, if you want to talk,
about anything, I'm here.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.384
Hey.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.122
God,
you gotta quit sneaking
up on me like that.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.680
I'm sorry.
What are you reading?

31:06.760 --> 31:08.193
I found Norah's journal.

31:08.260 --> 31:10.728
_ It was hidden
in a secret panel.

31:10.800 --> 31:12.290
_It's a lot of
calculations and numbers,

31:12.370 --> 31:14.167
but I want you to
listen to this, okay?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.767
"Noticed Mike's tremor again.

31:17.840 --> 31:20.104
"Shaking, especially
in his hands.

31:20.170 --> 31:22.138
"Neurological condition?"

31:22.210 --> 31:24.804
And here, from Friday,
the day she was killed,

31:24.880 --> 31:28.316
"Need to talk to Mike
about my concerns."

31:28.380 --> 31:30.473
So if Mike had
a neurological condition,

31:30.550 --> 31:32.916
then he would be disqualified
from the mission.

31:32.990 --> 31:35.857
Exactly right,
and if Norah figured it out,

31:35.920 --> 31:38.718
maybe he killed her
to keep his secret.

31:44.900 --> 31:46.219
Wait a second.

31:46.300 --> 31:49.861
Mike inspected the
Atmosphere Room on Friday,

31:49.940 --> 31:51.339
the day she was killed.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.935
I saw his initials
on the sign-in sheet.

31:54.010 --> 31:56.877
Okay. So let's say she walks
in and he's in there, right?

31:56.940 --> 31:58.202
Shh.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.145
Okay,
let's say she walks in
and he's in there.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.677
She asks him
about his condition,

32:01.750 --> 32:03.445
he flies off the handle,
and then he kills her.

32:03.520 --> 32:06.944
Yes.
But Why would he kill Simon?

32:09.960 --> 32:13.157
That's something
Mike's going to have
to answer for us.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.424
Where is he now?

32:14.500 --> 32:16.024
He said he's training
in the pool.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.888
I think it's time I gave Mike
his psychological evaluation.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.404
Mike?

32:28.210 --> 32:29.700
Wait.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.099
He's not moving.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.148
Mike!

32:33.210 --> 32:34.814
MIKE: Thanks, man.
Yeah, no problem.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.371
So just check
the nitrogen output levels

32:37.450 --> 32:39.042
in the Cold Room
at 19:00 hours?

32:39.120 --> 32:41.156
I owe you one.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.482
Simon wasn't
the target.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.549
Mike is.

32:49.930 --> 32:50.897
Come on, Mike.

32:50.960 --> 32:51.995
Breathe, Mike.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.890
What happened?

32:53.970 --> 32:55.289
Look at me.
Look at me.

32:55.370 --> 32:57.395
I need you to
tell us what happened.

32:57.470 --> 32:58.869
Uh...

32:58.940 --> 33:00.862
I was working on
the ventilation endurance.

33:00.940 --> 33:03.135
Right.
My suit filled With water.

33:03.210 --> 33:06.077
I went for the surface,
but I must have blacked out.

33:07.010 --> 33:08.944
Thank you, by the way.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.749
You move fast for a shrink.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.787
Mike, you can't
hide this anymore, okay?

33:15.860 --> 33:17.111
You can't.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.522
It's dangerous to you,
it's dangerous to the mission,

33:19.590 --> 33:22.354
and now I need you
to talk to me.

33:22.430 --> 33:25.866
Okay. I started getting
the shakes a couple weeks ago.

33:25.930 --> 33:29.093
Okay. Did anybody else
on the team notice?

33:29.170 --> 33:30.432
Norah picked up on it.

33:30.500 --> 33:32.730
We... She was worried
about me, so we talked.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.506
When was the last time
you saw Norah before she left?

33:35.580 --> 33:37.832
Um, Thursday night.

33:37.910 --> 33:40.708
I remember
I was feeling really sick,

33:40.780 --> 33:42.668
so bad that I asked
if she could help me out,

33:42.750 --> 33:44.718
take my inspection shift.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.610
She fudged the log
to cover for me.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.817
She signed it
With my initials.

33:48.890 --> 33:50.050
All right, listen to me.

33:50.120 --> 33:52.588
I want you to go
wait over there.

33:52.660 --> 33:53.979
Dr. Berg is
going to join you.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.948
Don't go anywhere
Without her, okay?

33:56.030 --> 33:58.169
We want to make
sure you're all right.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.993
What is going on?
Mike's not the suspect.

34:04.070 --> 34:05.662
He's the target!
What?

34:05.740 --> 34:07.469
I heard him
talking to Simon.

34:07.540 --> 34:09.428
Mike was supposed to
be in the Cold Room.

34:09.510 --> 34:11.603
He asked Simon
to cover for him.
Okay.

34:11.680 --> 34:14.148
Whoever killed Simon
was after Mike.

34:14.220 --> 34:15.778
We gotta think
this through.

34:15.850 --> 34:17.670
Okay, so let's say
Norah goes in

34:17.750 --> 34:20.617
and does an inspection
of the Atmosphere Room, right?

34:20.690 --> 34:23.352
And she finds something,
and she goes to Mike With it.

34:23.420 --> 34:25.229
Right, and Whatever it
is that she told Mike

34:25.290 --> 34:26.552
is What got her killed.

34:26.630 --> 34:29.258
Right, and Mike knows
What she knows,

34:29.330 --> 34:31.867
but he's still alive, Which
means his life is in danger,

34:31.930 --> 34:33.659
and now so is ours.

34:33.730 --> 34:35.163
Okay. Okay.
Stay With him.

34:35.240 --> 34:36.935
Don't let him out of your
sight, and be careful.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.139
All right,
but where you going?

34:39.210 --> 34:42.475
I'm going to
go find whatever it is
that Norah found.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.632
All right.

34:45.510 --> 34:47.341
All right.

34:47.410 --> 34:48.775
Talk to me, room.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.078
What happened?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.365
Oh, hey.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.691
What are you doing in here?

35:10.770 --> 35:13.307
Oh, nothing.
I was just trying to...

35:13.370 --> 35:15.634
...get a lay of the land,
you know, figure out...

35:15.710 --> 35:18.201
What do these readings
mean over here?

35:18.280 --> 35:21.249
Those are related to our
oxygen conver5ion tests,

35:21.320 --> 35:24.710
making sure we
are successfully converting
C02 to oxygen,

35:24.790 --> 35:27.281
and then those
numbers indicate
the duration of the tests.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.250
Oh, that's quite
a range between numbers.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.457
How long is
a normal test?

35:30.520 --> 35:33.182
Varies, but on average,
10 to 20 minutes?

35:33.260 --> 35:34.522
Do you ever experience
any kind of problems

35:34.600 --> 35:36.522
When the conversions
run longer?

35:36.600 --> 35:38.488
As the data analyst,

35:38.570 --> 35:42.097
I can assure you, the system
has performed impeccably,

35:42.170 --> 35:44.309
no matter the length of test,
but if you're concerned,

35:44.370 --> 35:46.338
we can always just
test them ourselves.

35:46.410 --> 35:48.378
Great, yeah.
I'd love to see it, thanks.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.170
I'll just let the
C02 run for a bit,

35:51.250 --> 35:54.469
and then we'll turn
the oxygen converters on.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.858
They're gonna
work just fine.

36:05.660 --> 36:07.059
Great.

36:08.030 --> 36:09.429
Sounds great.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.699
So... So what happens if,

36:15.770 --> 36:19.308
I don't know, they found
out that the converter

36:19.370 --> 36:21.531
couldn't work for
a sustained period of time?

36:21.610 --> 36:23.009
I mean, that would...

36:23.080 --> 36:26.709
Well, that would
certainly delay
or even cancel out

36:26.780 --> 36:29.874
the possibility
of a mission to Mars, right?

36:29.950 --> 36:33.738
Well, yeah,
if the problem was serious.

36:35.390 --> 36:38.587
But I'm not following.

36:38.660 --> 36:40.753
You murdered Norah.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.388
You murdered Simon,

36:42.460 --> 36:45.497
and you tried
to kill Mike

36:45.570 --> 36:46.719
so that they didn't find out

36:46.800 --> 36:51.260
that your COZ converter
does not work.

36:51.340 --> 36:53.661
This is all Norah's fault.

36:56.340 --> 36:59.047
She was the only
friend I had in here.

36:59.110 --> 37:02.773
We were going to be
the first women on Mars.

37:04.450 --> 37:06.088
But she betrayed me.

37:06.150 --> 37:10.109
I told her I just needed
time to fix the problem!

37:10.190 --> 37:12.488
She didn't get that.
She didn't get the mission.

37:15.430 --> 37:16.897
It's bigger than all of us!

37:19.100 --> 37:20.419
I had to make a choice.

37:30.810 --> 37:31.970
Shit!

37:51.470 --> 37:53.529
Come on, come on.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.492
Let's get some owgen
in here.

38:15.920 --> 38:18.855
Open the door! Open the door!
Open the door!

38:18.930 --> 38:22.093
I'm okay, I'm okay.

38:22.160 --> 38:24.151
COMPUTER: Termination
sequence commenced.

38:24.230 --> 38:26.869
_Two minutes_
until Site termination.

38:26.930 --> 38:28.568
What the hell is that?
Feld's so paranoid.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.699
He rigged this place
With a self-destruct system.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.237
DELINA: Erica
must have set it off.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.164
Get everybody
out of here now.

38:34.240 --> 38:36.674
I'm not...
I'll be right behind you. Go!

38:40.310 --> 38:43.609
Come on, come on, come on!
Go, out, come on, let's go!

38:43.680 --> 38:47.787
COMPUTER:
There are now 90 seconds
until site termination.

38:58.400 --> 39:01.858
There are now 30 seconds
until site termination.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.471
Erica, come on!

39:14.550 --> 39:15.744
COMPUTER:
There are now ten seconds
until site termination.

39:15.820 --> 39:16.809
I committed
to dying on Mars

39:16.880 --> 39:17.915
the second
I joined this program!

39:17.980 --> 39:22.019
Nine, eight, seven,

39:22.690 --> 39:27.059
six, five, four,

39:27.130 --> 39:31.521
three, two, one.

39:55.020 --> 39:56.556
Whoa, no, Whoa,
wait a minute.
It was crazy.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.917
No, it was unbelievable.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.720
You let the countdown
get all the way down to one,

40:00.790 --> 40:02.257
and you're still inside.

40:02.330 --> 40:03.820
Well, I didn't let that
happen, that's what happened,

40:03.900 --> 40:04.969
and we barely
made it out of there,

40:05.030 --> 40:06.691
but I'm here, and I'm safe.

40:06.770 --> 40:09.967
And all the
trainees are fine?
They're perfect.

40:10.040 --> 40:12.338
See, this is what
I don't get, though.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.434
Why did she do it?

40:13.510 --> 40:15.205
So here's how
it went down, okay?

40:15.280 --> 40:18.033
Norah finds out the
atmosphere scrubber
isn't working properly, right?

40:18.110 --> 40:19.771
So she goes to Erica
With her concerns.

40:19.850 --> 40:21.374
Now Erica
isn't about to let

40:21.450 --> 40:23.372
a small breathable air
problem get in her way

40:23.450 --> 40:24.781
on her space
on the Mars mission.

40:24.850 --> 40:25.885
So you know what she does?

40:25.950 --> 40:27.281
She kills Norah
in the Atmosphere Room

40:27.350 --> 40:29.284
and dumps her body
down the trash chute.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.749
That's insane.
But you know What?

40:31.830 --> 40:33.786
You did a great job, Delina.

40:33.860 --> 40:34.997
Thank you, Jay.

40:35.060 --> 40:37.699
You and Carrie make
a pretty kickass team.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.888
You should--you should
ride along more often.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.096
See, I don't
know about that,

40:42.170 --> 40:43.569
'cause the thing
about dead people is,

40:43.640 --> 40:45.460
they don't try to kill you.

40:48.480 --> 40:50.698
Oh, can I get
some of your red?

40:50.780 --> 40:53.578
Yeah, you can taste
some of my red.

40:53.650 --> 40:55.641
Welcome back.
You okay?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.814
They said all I have
to do is breathe some
fresh air for a while,

40:58.890 --> 41:00.118
and I'll be fine.

41:01.090 --> 41:02.284
What about Feld?

41:02.360 --> 41:04.783
Well, considering he just
blew 300 million bucks

41:04.860 --> 41:08.023
and five years of work,
I'd say not bad.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.524
So? Tell me.

41:10.600 --> 41:11.919
Tell you What?

41:12.000 --> 41:14.594
Are there really little
green men on Mars or not?

41:14.670 --> 41:16.729
I'll tell you mine
if you tell me yours.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.097
What?

41:18.170 --> 41:20.331
What...

41:20.410 --> 41:23.072
...is number one
on your bucket list?

41:23.140 --> 41:24.539
Wouldn't you
like to know?

41:24.610 --> 41:25.599
Come on, tell me.

41:25.680 --> 41:26.942
Go ahead, take a guess.

41:28.980 --> 41:30.845
All right.

41:30.920 --> 41:33.241
Catching a down-and-out from
Eli Manning in the end zone.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.412
What's number one?

41:36.490 --> 41:39.152
Number one.

41:39.230 --> 41:42.154
Does it have anything to do
With those twins in Barbados?

41:42.230 --> 41:43.492
No way.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.595
That's nine.

41:44.670 --> 41:45.659
Nine?

41:47.970 --> 41:49.130
I know What it is.

41:49.200 --> 41:50.531
Oh, you do, do you?

41:50.600 --> 41:52.101
It involves me.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.268
Maybe.

41:54.340 --> 41:56.069
I know What it is.
It's that...

41:56.140 --> 41:57.676
No, no, no, no.
Don't say it.

41:57.740 --> 41:59.378
Won't happen.
Well, can I whisper it?

41:59.450 --> 42:01.179
No!
I can whisper it!

42:01.250 --> 42:02.239
If I whisper it,
it'll still happen.

42:02.320 --> 42:03.446
I'm telling you,
it doesn't matter.

42:03.520 --> 42:04.748
You don't know.
If I don't know
What it is,

42:04.820 --> 42:05.889
then you have nothing
to worry about.

42:05.950 --> 42:08.043
Let me whisper it to you.
Okay.

42:08.120 --> 42:09.985
That way, if I'm right,
it'll still happen.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.152
Right.

42:21.530 --> 42:22.929
That's it, isn't it?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.934
I'm gonna drink
some of your red.

42:25.010 --> 42:26.637
That's it, that's it!
Cheers.

42:26.710 --> 42:27.699
Cheers.

42:27.770 --> 42:29.306
Mmm!
