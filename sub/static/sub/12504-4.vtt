WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:07.575
[Lauren] Previously,
on Make It or Break It:

00:07.608 --> 00:09.543
- Is that...?
- Sasha Belov.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.579
We have only 49 days
until Nationals,

00:11.612 --> 00:15.449
and you will spend every
waking moment of it
in this gym, together.

00:15.483 --> 00:17.485
Lauren's daddy may have bought
her way back into The Rock,

00:17.518 --> 00:20.154
but she's not buying
her way back into our group.

00:20.188 --> 00:21.555
You are cordially invited.

00:21.589 --> 00:23.191
"Blast Off?" What's that?

00:23.224 --> 00:26.094
1962. Brian Jones named the band

00:26.127 --> 00:27.595
after the Muddy Waters song,
Rollin' Stone.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.597
I believe this belongs to you.

00:29.630 --> 00:31.132
How many beers have you had?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.600
[all chanting]
Kaylie! Kaylie! Kaylie!

00:32.633 --> 00:33.567
You said you couldn't
come out tonight,

00:33.601 --> 00:36.070
and then I find you
partying with other guys?

00:36.104 --> 00:37.004
We'll just cool it for a while.

00:37.037 --> 00:39.540
I am not interested
in your father's money.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.575
You have "ambition"
written all over you.

00:41.609 --> 00:43.411
She's gotta have everybody
chasing after her.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.114
Screw her. Why are
we even talking about her?

00:46.147 --> 00:48.082
Why are we even
talking at all?

00:48.482 --> 00:50.084
You OK?

00:53.554 --> 00:55.423
[phone ringing]

00:59.360 --> 01:01.362
[ringing continues]

01:06.534 --> 01:12.240
[man] "Oh, wash me,
cleanse me from this guilt.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.843
Let me be pure again.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.579
Forgive me my shameful deed,

01:18.612 --> 01:21.549
for it haunts me day and night.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.319
Wash me through your grace
and I shall be whiter than
snow.

01:29.390 --> 01:34.295
And after you have punished me,
give me back my joy again.

01:39.633 --> 01:42.570
Create in me a good,
clean heart,

01:42.603 --> 01:46.674
God-filled with clean
thoughts and right desires.

01:46.707 --> 01:49.543
Don't toss me aside,

01:49.577 --> 01:53.147
banished from
Your presence forever."

01:53.181 --> 01:54.682
Amen Amen.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.717
[indistinct chatter]

01:58.619 --> 02:00.554
- Hey, I'll be right back.
- OK.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.691
You know, there are
easier ways to get laid

02:03.724 --> 02:06.327
than having to go to church
and pretend you believe in God.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.562
I believe in God, and not that
it's any of your business,

02:08.596 --> 02:13.434
but Summer and I aren't...
having intimate relations.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.537
- Yeah, right.
- Summer doesn't believe
in premarital sex,

02:16.570 --> 02:20.308
which is actually refreshing
these days when women and girls

02:20.341 --> 02:23.211
are willing to give it up
to just about anybody

02:23.244 --> 02:25.513
who'll give them
the time of day.

02:25.546 --> 02:28.449
So, she's a 30-year old virgin?
I doubt it.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.319
She's just trying to get you
to marry her by withholding sex.

02:31.352 --> 02:33.721
You know, I bet she's never
even been to this church before.

02:35.623 --> 02:38.659
Pastor Harold, this is Steve
Tanner and his daughter Lauren.

02:38.692 --> 02:42.230
It's so nice to meet you.
Summer's told us so much
about you. Lauren.

02:42.263 --> 02:44.665
I don't know what we would
do without her help with the
children's ministry.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.668
She's a wonderful woman, but
I don't have to tell you that.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.571
- No, you sure don't.
- [Harold] A word of advice?

02:50.604 --> 02:53.374
You better marry this gal before
somebody snatches her out from
under you.

02:53.407 --> 02:55.209
Under him? No chance
of that apparently.

02:56.777 --> 02:59.680
I'm not kidding. If you feel
the ground shaking,

02:59.713 --> 03:03.617
it's the stampede of
young men racing to march
this gal to the altar.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.586
I don't doubt it.

03:05.619 --> 03:08.289
Well, we better get going
before we get trampled.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.258
Thanks, Pastor Harold. Bye.

03:11.259 --> 03:12.526
What are you, eHarmony?

03:13.661 --> 03:15.329
[phone ringing]

03:19.800 --> 03:22.336
- [button beeping]
- Hello?

03:22.370 --> 03:23.637
This is Emily.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.375
Now?

03:27.408 --> 03:30.311
Uh, no, no problem.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.746
I'll be right there.
OK, bye.

03:35.416 --> 03:36.317
Who was that?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.752
That was the new coach.
He's calling us in.

03:38.786 --> 03:40.721
But honey, it's Sunday
and you need a day off.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.457
What day off? I'm supposed
to being doing a double
at the Pizza Shack,

03:43.491 --> 03:44.658
and we really
need the money.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.561
The first shift is usually slow.
Maybe they won't need me.

03:47.595 --> 03:50.464
Look, why don't I drop you at
the gym and I'll go to the Shack

03:50.498 --> 03:52.766
and sweet-talk your boss.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.568
Don't sweet-talk anyone.

03:54.602 --> 03:57.671
And remember, they can't
know I train at The Rock.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.773
So, what do you
think's going on?

04:03.611 --> 04:06.547
- Do you think we're in trouble?
- Why would we be in trouble?

04:06.580 --> 04:09.317
We will be if Sasha catches you
with your phone on the floor.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.654
I seriously don't know how I'm
going to get through a practice.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.457
My head is pounding
and I feel like dog.

04:16.490 --> 04:20.528
- Well, whose fault is that?
- [whispering] Thanks.

04:20.561 --> 04:23.297
Hey, do you think the
boys got called in, too?

04:23.331 --> 04:26.534
Right now it looks like
it's just you and me.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.306
- And her.
- Is it just us?

04:32.340 --> 04:34.675
Well, why would Sasha
just call the three of us in?

04:34.708 --> 04:36.710
Because he found out
we went to the kegger.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.813
- What if he found out?
- Payson, how would he find out?

04:39.847 --> 04:41.515
No, there's no way.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.619
So what, it's just
the four of us?

04:46.754 --> 04:47.688
How would we know?

04:47.721 --> 04:50.458
I hate to say it but
I'm happy to see her here.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.726
She didn't go to the party,
which means we can't be in
trouble.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.480
Cheers.

05:17.785 --> 05:19.620
So what are we doing here?
I don't get it.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.122
Neither do I. I thought you
all wanted to be exceptional.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.091
I thought you wanted
to be Olympic gymnasts,

05:24.124 --> 05:25.593
but apparently I was wrong.

05:25.626 --> 05:26.794
Apparently you're
the kind of teenagers

05:26.827 --> 05:28.762
who want to go
to parties and get drunk.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.831
So, hey, let's get stupid!

05:38.739 --> 05:40.741
What's the matter? Why aren't
you drinking your beers?

05:40.774 --> 05:44.712
That's what you want,
isn't it? To be ordinary
teenagers who screw up?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.514
I don't want to be ordinary,

05:46.547 --> 05:49.116
and I never wanted to go to that
stupid party in the first place.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.651
Then why did you?

05:50.684 --> 05:52.920
I went to make sure
nobody got into any trouble.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.889
Oh, you went as a chaperone?
How noble.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.493
And you?

05:59.527 --> 06:01.595
I went because they went.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.932
Did you know that sheep are
so dumb that if the lead sheep
jumps off the cliff,

06:04.965 --> 06:06.667
the rest of
the flock will follow?

06:06.700 --> 06:07.468
[mimicking sheep noises]

06:07.501 --> 06:09.803
Is that what you are?
A little lamb?

06:09.837 --> 06:12.606
I don't even know what I'm
doing here, because wasn't
even at this party.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.841
[sighing]

06:20.748 --> 06:22.783
You're wasting my time!

06:24.585 --> 06:28.689
Give me one reason I shouldn't
get on a plane and go back
home right now?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.858
Because you can't!
We need you, and we're sorry

06:30.891 --> 06:32.826
and we'll never do
it again. We promise!

06:32.860 --> 06:35.829
Words. "I'm sorry,"
"I promise."

06:35.863 --> 06:39.733
You won't do it again because
you're all on probation

06:39.767 --> 06:44.438
and if just one of you screws
up, even a little bit, then I
am out of here.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.640
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

06:48.876 --> 06:51.845
- Is that clear?
- [all] Yes, sir.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.618
That's all I had to say.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.532
Excuse me.
Did I dismiss you?

07:11.565 --> 07:13.734
It's one thing
to say you're sorry,

07:13.767 --> 07:15.769
but I want you
to really feel it.

07:15.803 --> 07:19.439
And I promise,
after today, you will.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.571
Oh, excuse me?

07:50.604 --> 07:51.905
Um, you're the manager, right?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.007
Who wants to know?
Are you with the Feds?

07:54.041 --> 07:57.778
- What?
- Uh, look, we're slammed.

07:57.811 --> 08:02.282
- You want to order anything?
- No.

08:02.315 --> 08:05.819
- I'm Emily's mother.
- Where the hell is she?
We're slammed!

08:05.853 --> 08:07.855
Yes, you said that, hon.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.924
Um, look, she's not
gonna be able to make
her first shift, due to

08:10.958 --> 08:13.727
personal reasons of which
I'm not at liberty to say.

08:13.761 --> 08:18.566
We're slammed. If she doesn't
get someone to cover her shift,
she's fired!

08:21.635 --> 08:27.575
One large pepperoni and
pineapple pizza con extra queso.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.712
Damon Young reporting
for duty, boss lady.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.682
Oh, I'm not the boss, I'm...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.950
...Emily's... sister.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.753
- I'm filling in.
- Well, that makes two of us.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.622
I'm filling in
for my buddy, Razor.

08:41.655 --> 08:44.758
So, you have no idea
what to do, either?

08:44.792 --> 08:48.662
- Hm, nada.
- Great. Great.

08:50.731 --> 08:55.102
So, you must be Emily's,
uh, younger sister. Right?

08:55.135 --> 08:58.005
[chuckling] Aren't you adorable.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.741
Well, your older sister
is not bad, either.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.111
You know, you're the kind
of boy that mothers tell their
daughters to stay away from.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.847
But you're far too young
to be anyone's mother.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.984
Oh, you're good.
[chuckling] Really good.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.822
Oh, look, there's an art fair
downtown we could go to.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.325
Avery asked
me to go to the movies.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.828
But Sunday is family day.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.930
But Payson's at practice
and Dad's working.

09:22.963 --> 09:25.899
That doesn't mean you and I
can't do something fun together.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.035
That's the key word, Mom.
"Fun."

09:28.068 --> 09:32.039
- What about the planetarium?
- [fake snoring]

09:32.072 --> 09:35.876
OK, fine.
Go to the movies.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.814
You could come with us.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.051
I'll find something to do.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.723
- All alone.
- [door closing]

09:49.757 --> 09:52.626
On family day.

09:56.196 --> 09:59.733
- Hey, Maggie, how are you?
- Kaylie's not here.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.069
Uh, I'm here to see Leo.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.771
[Maggie] Sure you are.

10:05.873 --> 10:07.741
- Where's Kaylie?
- Remember when you
were my friend

10:07.775 --> 10:09.810
before you started sneaking
around with my sister?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.845
Carter, Carter.
Where's our love?

10:11.879 --> 10:14.782
- I'm serious.
- Don't worry.
She still loves you.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.918
She was freaking out last night
because you're so wonderful

10:17.951 --> 10:19.787
and she doesn't deserve you.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.855
But unfortunately your
kiss and make-up scene's

10:21.889 --> 10:24.925
gonna have to wait, because
"Sasha the Terrible"

10:24.958 --> 10:27.795
- called the girls to practice.
- The girls? Lauren, too?

10:27.828 --> 10:29.897
I'm assuming.
Since the bitch is back.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.131
[groaning]

10:32.232 --> 10:34.101
Dude, she'll
be home in a few hours.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.836
No, I need to
talk to her, now.

10:35.869 --> 10:37.971
So what's so urgent
that it can't wait?

10:40.841 --> 10:42.209
- I can't tell you.
- Hey, man,

10:42.242 --> 10:44.945
even though you
dumped me for my sister,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.113
we're still friends.

10:47.848 --> 10:51.018
I...
[sighing]

10:51.051 --> 10:53.120
Oh, man, uh...

10:55.022 --> 10:58.826
I did something
that I really regret...

10:58.859 --> 11:02.796
...something that

11:02.830 --> 11:06.066
I would just give
anything to take back.

11:06.099 --> 11:10.170
Something that when I tell you,

11:10.203 --> 11:13.841
you're probably gonna
want to kill me.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.677
[rock music]

11:21.849 --> 11:23.683
One hundred.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.154
One-ten.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.858
One-twenty.

11:30.891 --> 11:33.794
[Payson] I told you we shouldn't
have gone to that stupid party!

11:33.827 --> 11:36.730
[Emily grunting]
How in the hell did he find out?

11:36.764 --> 11:38.131
[Lauren] Someone must
have told him, Payson.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.801
You think it was me?
I'm in trouble here, too.

11:40.834 --> 11:41.902
As if you don't live
for punishment.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.138
- That's the truth.
- Hey? Whose side are you on?

11:45.172 --> 11:48.876
- Yeah, not hers.
- Lucky I did go
because you got trashed.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.745
I'd have loved to see
Miss Goody-Two-Shoes drunk
off her ass.

11:51.779 --> 11:54.114
I think this might be a little
bit easier if we all shut up.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.149
We didn't see you at the party.
Who were you there with?

11:56.183 --> 11:58.852
- I have friends.
- I think you mean frenemies.

11:58.886 --> 12:01.755
You know who
else was there? Carter.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.927
What's this? I said 300.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.262
- I can't.
- Did you say,
"I can't go to the kegger?"

12:09.296 --> 12:13.166
Or, "I can't drink beer?"
"I can't" is for losers.
Is that what you are?

12:13.200 --> 12:15.903
And seeing as your teammate
just stopped, you can all
start again from one.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.170
[all groaning]

12:17.204 --> 12:19.907
Legs up, ladies! Start again!

12:21.008 --> 12:22.943
[Leo] Oh, no, you didn't.

12:24.277 --> 12:27.948
Do not tell me that you hooked
up with Lauren last night.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.918
I was drinking and I don't know
what the hell made me do it.

12:30.951 --> 12:33.053
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't smash
your face in right now?

12:33.086 --> 12:34.922
You should hit me.
I deserve it.

12:34.955 --> 12:35.956
I'm not gonna hit you.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.296
- What do I do?
- [sighing]

12:43.330 --> 12:46.934
If you tell her,
she's gonna be devastated.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.136
She'll never
want to see you again.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.105
Which is impossible because
you guys both train at The Rock.

12:52.139 --> 12:56.076
So, in a way, what she
doesn't know can't hurt her.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.812
- On the other hand...
- What if Lauren tells her?

12:58.846 --> 12:59.880
If she didn't already.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.850
I gotta get to The Rock.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.818
I gotta tell Kaylie
before Lauren does.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.854
[sighing] Good luck.
Hey, one more thing.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.888
[grunting]

13:10.290 --> 13:12.059
I thought you said
you weren't gonna hit me.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.894
I changed my mind.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.365
[hip-hop music]

13:19.867 --> 13:21.401
Ten more minutes to get to 20.

13:22.970 --> 13:23.971
* You're crazy

13:24.004 --> 13:26.173
- * Oh, oh, oh, oh
- * You're crazy

13:26.206 --> 13:27.574
[all straining, panting]

13:27.607 --> 13:29.943
So, did you talk to Carter
last night at the party?

13:29.977 --> 13:32.279
Why do you care? It's not
like he's your boyfriend.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.848
At least that's what
you told everyone... that
I lied about you and Carter

13:34.882 --> 13:36.083
to get you kicked out
of the gym, right?

13:36.116 --> 13:38.618
I was just curious that somebody
else from the gym was there.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.387
So you don't want to
know what we talked about?

13:40.420 --> 13:43.256
Can you two just zip it before
Sasha makes us all start
over again?

13:43.290 --> 13:47.094
[grunting] What's up with him
anyway? Is he some sort of
sadist or something?

13:47.127 --> 13:48.996
We went to a party.
Big deal.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.865
It is a big deal. Do you think
Kelly Parker's going to parties?

13:51.899 --> 13:54.267
I doubt it. Not with
that horsey face.

13:54.301 --> 13:56.937
[gasping] That's a wrap
on me. Have fun ladies!

13:56.970 --> 13:57.971
[sighing]

13:58.972 --> 14:01.141
Thank God you're here.
The new coach is crazy.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.943
I hope you're here
to set him straight.

14:02.976 --> 14:04.644
I'm here to talk to him
about The Rock,

14:04.677 --> 14:06.379
not to get you
out of practice.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.882
[whispering] This isn't
practice, it's torture!

14:08.916 --> 14:13.887
Sasha? Could I have a word
with you? In private?

14:13.921 --> 14:16.256
- I'm a little busy right now.
- It won't take long.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.359
Daddy?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.996
Oh, you can all start again.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.864
Thirty climbs
in 15 minutes.

14:32.339 --> 14:36.143
You know who made
all of these possible, right?

14:37.677 --> 14:41.214
Me. I built The Rock
from nothing

14:41.248 --> 14:44.651
into one of the top five
gymnastics clubs in the country.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.988
I even personally
bankrolled most of it.

14:48.021 --> 14:51.458
- These are my dividends.
- Congratulations.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.961
Thanks.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.464
But it's not enough,
you know that.

14:57.497 --> 15:01.434
You need to convince
the board to reinstall me

15:01.468 --> 15:04.171
- as President and Manager.
- Why must I convince them?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.340
Politics.

15:07.374 --> 15:09.709
Some of the other parents
have personal agendas,

15:09.742 --> 15:13.280
Alex Cruz, for example,
is a real hothead,

15:13.313 --> 15:15.415
which is what tanked
his baseball career.

15:15.448 --> 15:20.988
But it's your call.
If you insist that
you need me to run this place,

15:21.021 --> 15:23.390
that'll be all it takes.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.158
Do you have a close
relationship with your daughter?

15:25.192 --> 15:27.727
- What?
- Can she talk to you?

15:27.760 --> 15:33.066
Yeah, I mean, yeah, of course.
But what's that got to do with
The Rock?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.202
I'm just wondering if
she has anyone to talk to.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.972
We talk, and she
has her friends.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.512
So you'll talk to the board?

15:45.545 --> 15:48.982
You make a very convincing
argument, Tanner.

15:49.016 --> 15:52.519
Tell you what.
Why don't I sleep on it

15:52.552 --> 15:55.155
and then I'll get back
to you in the morning.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.526
Excellent.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.162
That's enough on the ropes,
ladies.

16:02.195 --> 16:05.498
- Upper body work on the bar
till I get back.
- [all groaning, sighing]

16:05.532 --> 16:09.436
Oh, looks like this is
one coach Daddy can't buy.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.771
Oh, I'm sorry, did you
just say something?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.042
I was too busy thinking about
what Carter told me last night.

16:17.044 --> 16:21.014
So, uh, I'll look forward
to hearing from you, then.

16:21.048 --> 16:24.417
And, please don't forget,
I brought you here.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.586
And don't forget,
I agreed to come.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.001
May I help you?

16:43.536 --> 16:48.441
- Oh, hey. I'm a gymnast here.
- Yeah. Carter Anderson. I know
who you are.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.378
Oh. I just need to get
something I left in the gym.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.380
Something that
can't wait till tomorrow?

16:53.413 --> 16:56.049
Uh, it's something I need now.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.019
Tell me what it is.
I'll go get it for you.

17:00.420 --> 17:04.124
Uh, it's, uh...

17:05.492 --> 17:06.626
Um...

17:08.428 --> 17:10.630
Mustn't be that important if
you can't remember what it is.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.201
Besides, it's Sunday.
The gym's closed.

17:14.234 --> 17:19.506
Oh. OK. I'll just...
get it tomorrow.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.586
Leo? It's me.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.655
Does your dad still
have keys to The Rock?

17:40.127 --> 17:43.263
- OK, that's enough.
- [all sighing]

17:49.536 --> 17:53.106
No matter how brilliantly
I coach you,

17:53.140 --> 17:55.642
you won't succeed
without each other.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.546
You need your teammates
standing beside you,

17:59.579 --> 18:03.383
rooting you on to do the
superhuman feats this sport
requires to be great.

18:03.416 --> 18:08.388
And maybe it's just me, but
I'm sensing a certain lack
of bonding here.

18:08.421 --> 18:12.159
So I think we need
to clear the air.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.861
Now this is a little ritual
I like to do from time to time.

18:14.894 --> 18:19.399
Actually, I saw it on Ellen.
On that piece of paper, I want
you all to write down

18:19.432 --> 18:21.634
any resentments you're
harboring towards each other.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.571
We will then fold them up
and burn them in this bin.

18:24.604 --> 18:28.441
Then we can all start anew,
with a nice clean slate.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.348
Off you go.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.199
This is good.

18:52.232 --> 18:54.401
By putting your resentments
in this bin,

18:54.434 --> 18:56.436
you're pledging
to release the past.

18:56.469 --> 19:01.508
We will set them on
fire and burn the past away.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.376
But first, I'll read
them aloud.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.352
I thought they were secret.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.687
I don't recall saying
they were secret.

19:14.721 --> 19:18.591
Besides, how do you expect
to clear the air

19:18.625 --> 19:21.361
if you don't know
what's in it?

19:21.394 --> 19:24.364
Don't worry.
They'll still be anonymous.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.200
OK...

19:27.234 --> 19:29.302
"I resent that no one
trains as hard as I do,

19:29.336 --> 19:32.639
or wants this as much as I do.
I also resent that Sasha doesn't

19:32.672 --> 19:35.742
seem to realize I'm better
than everyone else."

19:35.775 --> 19:36.843
Gee, I wonder who
wrote that one.

19:36.876 --> 19:39.612
[Sasha] No comments
from the peanut gallery, please.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.582
"I resent that my best friend
tried to get me kicked out
of the gym

19:42.615 --> 19:44.751
and that she won't believe
I'm not dating Carter."

19:44.784 --> 19:46.519
Interesting.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.757
"I resent that my friends who
I've known and trained with
for ten years

19:50.790 --> 19:53.460
didn't stand up for me when
Miss Trailer Trash showed up

19:53.493 --> 19:54.994
and knocked me out
of third place,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.696
which only happened
because I had a bad day,

19:56.729 --> 19:59.599
not because she's better
than me, because she has
no technique

19:59.632 --> 20:03.503
and no consistency and
will tank at Nationals,"
exclamation mark.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.239
- Well, it's true.
- [Sasha] What did I say
about shutting your mouth?

20:06.273 --> 20:07.507
- Sor...
- [Sasha] Shush!

20:08.508 --> 20:13.513
OK, last but
I'm sure not least.

20:13.546 --> 20:17.284
"I resent that no one has
made me feel welcome here."

20:23.823 --> 20:25.425
Now, don't we feel better?

20:32.765 --> 20:36.303
OK. Now today's
conditioning is over.

20:38.805 --> 20:42.041
Whoa, whoa, whoa?
Where are you going?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.043
I said conditioning was over.
Now you'll clean all the mats.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.413
- [Kaylie] All the mats?
- [Lauren] That could
take hours!

20:46.446 --> 20:49.649
- I can't stay.
- You have something better
to do?

20:49.682 --> 20:51.718
Go to another party perhaps?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.753
I just... I have
somewhere I have to be.

20:53.786 --> 20:56.756
Does anybody else have
somewhere they have to be?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.625
- Yeah.
- You're in good company, then.

20:58.658 --> 21:01.060
You will all stay
and clean the mats

21:01.093 --> 21:03.696
or don't bother
showing up tomorrow or ever.

21:03.730 --> 21:06.433
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.702
All right, then. I'll notify
your parents that you're
staying late,

21:09.736 --> 21:13.440
and to avoid distractions,
if you'll just surrender
your cell phones.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.450
[buttons beeping]

21:23.483 --> 21:25.352
[Sasha] Kaylie, now.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.726
I don't have a cell phone.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.464
If you're expecting a call
from Carter, you may be
disappointed.

21:37.497 --> 21:39.732
- You don't know
what your talking about.
- Don't I?

21:39.766 --> 21:42.635
I'll check in on
you periodically.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.871
And I trust you know where
the cleaning supplies are?

21:44.904 --> 21:48.775
Oh, and they better
pass inspection.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.445
- This sucks!
- Ya think?

21:52.479 --> 21:54.747
Let's just get this done
as fast as possible.

21:54.781 --> 21:57.417
She's right. Let's stop
complaining and get it done.

21:57.450 --> 21:59.752
You know what, Pay,
why don't you do it,
since you seem to think

21:59.786 --> 22:01.788
you're so much better
than everybody else, right?

22:01.821 --> 22:04.357
As if that's
big news.

22:04.391 --> 22:07.460
I didn't know he was going
to read them out loud, OK?

22:07.494 --> 22:09.896
Well, I'm glad he did,
because now everyone knows
Kaylie's seeing Carter.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.665
I wrote that I wasn't
seeing Carter, actually.

22:12.699 --> 22:15.602
Sasha's not stupid like Marty.
He obviously knows what's
going on.

22:15.635 --> 22:16.836
Yeah, he knew we went
to that party.

22:16.869 --> 22:18.805
Because someone
must have told him.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.841
- It wasn't me!
- Oh, I guess he's
a psychic now.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.743
And by the way, Lauren.

22:23.776 --> 22:26.646
Emily beat you fair and
square in Marty's trials.

22:26.679 --> 22:30.750
I mean, do you expect us all
to walk out of Nationals when
you fall off the beam again?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.585
That's something different, OK?

22:32.619 --> 22:34.621
OK, it's not about
friendship or loyalty.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.789
When we're competing, we're
competing against ourselves,

22:36.823 --> 22:40.460
not each other. So let's band
together and get this done.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.395
Yeah, but she's all out
for herself anyways.

22:42.429 --> 22:44.897
Look who's talking! And you
think you're better than anyone.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.699
Because I work harder
than both of you!

22:46.733 --> 22:48.735
- Are you serious?
- Will you all just shut up?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.770
Have you ever stopped
to listen to yourself

22:50.803 --> 22:53.506
and all your stupid, petty
little problems you bitch about?

22:53.540 --> 22:56.509
You guys have somebody
to do everything for you.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.479
Cook, clean, pay your dues,
buy you clothes.

22:59.512 --> 23:01.414
All you have to do is train.

23:01.448 --> 23:05.752
Do you know how much I wish
that's all I had to worry about?

23:05.785 --> 23:08.688
But I have to work.
At a real job.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.691
Which, if I'm not at in 30
minutes, I'm gonna be fired.

23:11.724 --> 23:15.828
So would you please shut up?
And get going.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.471
Uh, table ten, six, could be
eight, I don't quite have the
numbers down,

23:24.504 --> 23:25.805
needs their fried
cheese sticks.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.841
Although I have to say,
anything fried is the last
thing they need.

23:28.875 --> 23:32.712
OK, got it, um... We need
fried queso sticks rápido!

23:32.745 --> 23:34.447
- [man] Si.
- You speak Spanish?

23:34.481 --> 23:36.916
Un poquito.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.586
I've been a waitress,
a hotel maid

23:39.619 --> 23:42.855
and I worked at the DMV
for a very short, dark period.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.992
- It helps to be bilingual.
- So, what brings you to
Boulder?

23:46.025 --> 23:47.960
And don't say temp work
at the Pizza Shack.

23:47.994 --> 23:50.597
My daughter
trains at The Rock.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.900
- Emily's a gymnast?
- She's a world class gymnast.

23:53.933 --> 23:56.669
She has a real shot at
the Olympics. That's why
we moved here.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.871
- Hm-hm.
- [man] Here you go.

23:58.905 --> 24:01.941
Oh, and all that was
supposed to be a secret.

24:01.974 --> 24:07.213
- Why?
- Because Emily's a
very private person.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.483
- You mean guarded.
- Yeah, it's my fault, OK?

24:10.517 --> 24:13.753
I'm the tell-all type and she
wants to be anything but me.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.888
- Razor...
- Damon.

24:15.922 --> 24:19.759
- Whatever, table six needs
their cheese sticks.
- Six, I knew it.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.227
And you!
Get back to work.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.530
And you, get some manners!

24:25.565 --> 24:27.867
- I'm takin' a five!
- [whistles]

24:27.900 --> 24:30.770
You know what her secret is?
She's a meth-head.

24:30.803 --> 24:33.005
- Honey, that is no secret.
- [chuckling]

24:38.678 --> 24:42.048
How are you going to work and
be at the gym every waking hour
until Nationals?

24:42.081 --> 24:45.017
- I don't know.
- You could get kicked out of
the gym for working a job.

24:45.051 --> 24:47.554
We could also get kicked out
of our apartment if I don't.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.823
Will your boss really fire you
if you don't show up to work?

24:50.857 --> 24:53.660
Yeah, that's how it works
in the real world.

24:53.693 --> 24:56.763
Look, I know you said we haven't
made you feel very welcome here

24:56.796 --> 24:58.965
but we've invited you places.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.801
You guys also completely
dissed me when I showed up here.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.070
[Payson] Well, we've tried since
then. And by the way,

25:04.103 --> 25:06.706
you don't really want to
share things about yourself.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.840
I think I just did.

25:11.644 --> 25:15.682
What's the point? I'm not
gonna get to work on time.
I'm screwed.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.717
Lauren, come on.
Get back to work.

25:19.652 --> 25:23.690
Why don't you go?
We'll cover for you.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.859
- Why?
- Because you covered for me
with Carter,

25:26.893 --> 25:28.127
and I haven't
forgotten that.

25:29.762 --> 25:32.965
All right, guys, listen up.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.568
Emily's going to work
and we're covering for her.

25:35.602 --> 25:36.836
[scoffing] Speak for yourself.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.572
For once I have to agree
with Lauren on this.

25:39.606 --> 25:40.840
Sasha's right
outside the door.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.074
What about
your all-for-one speech?

25:42.108 --> 25:43.976
What about supporting
each other?

25:44.010 --> 25:47.914
- In the gym.
- Is that where it stops?
In here?

25:47.947 --> 25:51.584
So outside these walls it
doesn't matter what we do
to each other?

25:51.618 --> 25:54.020
Guys, if we can't spot
each other out there,

25:54.053 --> 25:55.755
how can we trust
each other in here?

25:59.759 --> 26:00.860
Go.

26:02.028 --> 26:05.097
- Go.
- What about her?

26:08.768 --> 26:09.902
I guess
I owe you one.

26:11.871 --> 26:15.908
OK, so. You can't go out the
front door, back door's locked.

26:15.942 --> 26:18.010
- Which leaves...
- How about the windows?

26:18.044 --> 26:19.345
How're we gonna
get her up there?

26:19.378 --> 26:20.780
Since she's so awesome

26:20.813 --> 26:22.915
why doesn't she vault up there?

26:23.783 --> 26:25.818
I'm kidding.

26:25.852 --> 26:30.723
- She could...
- She could climb the rope,
and then we just kinda...

26:30.757 --> 26:32.759
...gotta swing her
over to the window.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.861
OK. I'll go look out for Sasha.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.831
[phone ringing]

26:38.865 --> 26:40.933
[rock music]

26:43.836 --> 26:47.807
- Sasha Belov.
- Ah, Mr. Cruz... Alex...

26:50.843 --> 26:53.646
No, I was not aware
he was a hothead.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.882
* I'm doing 90
And I'm coming for you *

26:55.915 --> 26:59.786
* No one to stop me,
'Cause I know what to do *

26:59.819 --> 27:03.189
* I'm running streets
Like a runaway train *

27:03.222 --> 27:07.026
* I'm like the devil
In this dangerous game *

27:07.059 --> 27:09.161
* Cold heart...

27:09.195 --> 27:12.699
Yeah, as a matter of fact,
Steve Tanner came and spoke
to me today.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.835
Thanks.

27:17.704 --> 27:19.238
He's coming!

27:22.842 --> 27:25.077
I understand.

27:25.111 --> 27:28.881
Well Alex, you make a very
convincing argument for why
you should manage the gym.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.950
The rope!

27:32.852 --> 27:36.155
Alex, Alex, Alex,
why don't I sleep on it

27:36.188 --> 27:38.124
and perhaps we can talk
in the morning.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.760
OK, great. Bye.

27:42.128 --> 27:46.165
* He told me to strike
He told me to strike **

27:51.804 --> 27:53.873
- Where's Emily?
- [together] In the bathroom.

27:55.808 --> 27:56.943
Carry on.

28:00.913 --> 28:03.249
What do you think Sasha
would do if he catches us?

28:03.282 --> 28:05.785
Besides kick us out of the gym?
Or go back to England?

28:05.818 --> 28:10.256
- Or tar and feather us?
- Well, he said to support
each other.

28:10.289 --> 28:14.894
- Maybe he'll be impressed.
- [groans] I'm gonna get
an ulcer. I just know it.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.809
- What is that?
- It's my house. They just
delivered it.

28:29.842 --> 28:32.011
- What do you think?
- You're gonna live
in the parking lot?

28:32.044 --> 28:36.916
- I prefer a short commute.
- No kidding.

28:36.949 --> 28:40.887
- I'm gonna pick up Payson.
- Oh, I left you a message.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.955
The girls are cleaning the mats.
They're gonna be a few more
hours.

28:42.989 --> 28:45.324
Cleaning mats?

28:48.895 --> 28:52.064
You didn't call them
in on Sunday for practice?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.532
Not exactly, no.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.168
- Look Mr. Belov...
- Sasha, please.

28:56.202 --> 28:59.906
Sundays aren't just the only day
these girls have to rest,

28:59.939 --> 29:03.309
it's the only day most of them
get to spend any time at all
with their families.

29:03.342 --> 29:06.212
They need that. We need that.

29:06.245 --> 29:11.984
Sundays are family day in our
house and speaking for us,
that is sacred.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.853
I understand.

29:15.922 --> 29:20.927
- So where is your husband?
- He had to work. But that was
an exception.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.830
- And Becca?
- She went to a movie
with a friend.

29:23.863 --> 29:26.098
So, you spent family
day all alone.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.835
Yes, I did, and it sucked.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.269
Please, sit.

29:34.874 --> 29:40.346
So, what do you do? I mean,
besides driving your children
to and from the gym.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.148
Well, that's a full time job.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.284
So, you wouldn't be interested
in managing the gym, then?

29:45.317 --> 29:49.822
- What?
- Look, I need someone
who cares about the children,

29:49.856 --> 29:52.959
not the politics. And you
seem like a capable woman.

29:52.992 --> 29:56.829
Well, thank you. But I don't
know anything about managing
a gym.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.298
And I haven't had a job
since before Payson was born.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.732
I don't know anything
about managing a gym, either.

30:00.766 --> 30:05.204
But you manage your family
and you seem to do a pretty
good job of that.

30:05.237 --> 30:08.107
- I'd have to talk to my
husband about it first.
- Of course.

30:08.140 --> 30:12.945
Could I sleep on this and
let you know in the morning?

30:12.979 --> 30:15.381
Absolutely.

30:15.414 --> 30:19.986
- So, Emily's working a double?
- Yeah, she should be here any
minute.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.122
Maybe I should hang around.
Help with the dinner rush.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.158
You know, I thought that
you were Razor's buddy.

30:26.192 --> 30:30.262
- I am.
- So, how would he feel about
you invading his territory?

30:30.296 --> 30:34.200
He's the one that asked me
to fill in. And it's not like
Razor's her boyfriend.

30:34.233 --> 30:39.638
Yeah, I wish.
Emily's never had time for boys.

30:39.671 --> 30:43.275
Ever since she was a little
girl, swinging like a monkey
on the jungle gym,

30:43.309 --> 30:47.313
gymnastics has been her whole
life. You know, I don't think
she's ever even been kissed.

30:49.081 --> 30:52.418
Mom? What are you doing?

30:52.451 --> 30:57.423
Uh... honey, I had
to fill in for you.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.892
If not, your boss
was going to fire you.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.294
You worked all day for me?

31:03.429 --> 31:06.632
With... him?

31:06.665 --> 31:10.903
Look, I'm just filling for
Razor. But it's cool.
Your mom's awesome.

31:10.937 --> 31:14.173
You know what? I'm just
gonna punch out, that's it.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.641
Oh...

31:15.674 --> 31:19.946
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing. I swear.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.915
Call me if you need a ride!
[giggling]

31:36.495 --> 31:39.065
What the hell
took you so long?

31:39.098 --> 31:40.933
It's not like I could
just go up to my dad

31:40.967 --> 31:43.202
and ask him for
the keys to The Rock.

31:43.235 --> 31:46.005
Dude, you sure
you wanna do this?

31:46.038 --> 31:48.240
I have to get in there before
Lauren tells Kaylie about us.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.076
You realize if you get caught
sneaking into the gym,

31:50.109 --> 31:52.478
Belov could throw you
out of the club entirely.

31:52.511 --> 31:56.382
Yeah, well, bring it on.

32:02.121 --> 32:05.958
I wonder what other secrets
the playground prodigy has.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.493
I bet having a
job is just one of them.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.997
- Everyone has secrets.
- Yeah, we know Kaylie.
Care to share?

32:11.030 --> 32:12.931
I don't have any secrets.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.535
Well, I have a secret.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.344
- I'm not a virgin anymore.
- What?

32:28.280 --> 32:30.983
You lost your virginity?

32:31.017 --> 32:33.752
- When?
- Last night, at the party.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.554
Last night at the party?
With who?

32:37.089 --> 32:39.558
Lo, you have to tell us.

32:44.530 --> 32:47.133
[stammering] Just some guy
I met. I didn't know him.

32:47.166 --> 32:49.401
- You had sex with a guy
you didn't even know?
- Yeah, so what?

32:49.435 --> 32:50.536
Lauren how could you?

32:50.569 --> 32:53.072
I was sick of being a virgin

32:53.105 --> 32:55.007
and I'm sick of
only doing gymnastics

32:55.041 --> 32:56.342
and just wanted to be
like other girls our age.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.744
Not all girls our age
are having sex.

32:58.777 --> 33:00.779
And we aren't
like every other girl.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.748
Well, at least
they have boyfriends.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.783
What do I have
besides gymnastics

33:04.816 --> 33:06.552
and a father who's
ready to replace me

33:06.585 --> 33:08.154
- with some Bible-beating
gold-digger!
- What?

33:08.187 --> 33:13.092
My dad's dating his secretary
and she's totally manipulating
him into marrying her.

33:13.125 --> 33:17.329
- Wow, that's a bummer.
- I can't believe you had sex.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.165
Don't feel sorry for me.
I'm glad I did it.

33:21.500 --> 33:26.238
- What was it like?
- It was OK.

33:26.272 --> 33:28.174
It's not exactly romantic.

33:28.207 --> 33:31.310
Yeah, I've heard it's never good
for girls their first time.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.445
Even if you're
in love with the guy.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.582
Aren't you afraid having sex
will stimulate your hormones
or something?

33:36.615 --> 33:41.553
I mean, what if you
get big boobs or big hips?

33:41.587 --> 33:43.822
That'd kill your gymnastics.

33:43.855 --> 33:48.060
Having sex doesn't suddenly
give you J-Lo butt or
Pam Anderson boobs.

33:48.094 --> 33:49.561
Especially not
the way we work out.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.597
[Payson]
How can you take a risk
on something like that?

33:51.630 --> 33:55.634
Our bodies are everything we
have. Everything we work for.

33:57.269 --> 33:58.570
I'm not having sex until I have
a gold medal,

33:58.604 --> 34:00.439
and maybe
not even after that.

34:02.174 --> 34:08.080
What? We have our entire
lives to have sex

34:08.114 --> 34:11.283
but only one chance
at the Olympics.

34:11.317 --> 34:15.521
At least Kaylie and I
aren't dumb enough to
blow it on boyfriends.

34:17.856 --> 34:23.395
OK! OK! I have a boyfriend.
Yes, I'm with Carter.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.132
- I don't believe this!
- Look, I'm sorry I lied to you,

34:26.165 --> 34:28.267
but I didn't think that
you would understand.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.337
Kaylie, I don't understand. Why
isn't gymnastics enough for you?

34:31.370 --> 34:33.439
And what about me?
Don't I deserve an apology?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.207
She totally lied
about her and Carter.

34:35.241 --> 34:37.343
No. You don't deserve an apology
for betraying your friend.

34:37.376 --> 34:39.511
- Thank you.
- And you're no better.

34:39.545 --> 34:43.249
You lied to your best friends.
What happened to us?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.451
We used to tell
each other everything.

34:45.484 --> 34:48.120
Now it's all
secrets and lies

34:48.154 --> 34:51.290
and we're acting like
a bunch of little bitches.

34:51.323 --> 34:55.261
Remember when we said we weren't
gonna be those girls who stabbed
each other in the back?

34:55.294 --> 34:58.330
Well, guess what?
We're those girls now.

34:58.364 --> 35:01.500
Is that really the way you
want things to be from now on?

35:01.533 --> 35:03.569
[sniffling]

35:03.602 --> 35:07.306
- No.
- No.

35:08.574 --> 35:11.877
I'm sorry I told Marty
about you and Carter.

35:11.910 --> 35:15.514
Yeah, and I'm
sorry I lied to you.

35:16.915 --> 35:19.418
- Both of you.
- OK.

35:21.520 --> 35:22.721
Kiss and make up.

35:26.625 --> 35:29.661
I missed you.
And Denver totally sucked.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.699
[laughing]

35:33.732 --> 35:36.502
You guys, we should stop messing
around and get back to work.

35:38.404 --> 35:40.672
Yeah.

35:40.706 --> 35:46.178
- Yeah, she's right.
- Yeah, we should really
stop messing around.

35:46.212 --> 35:48.647
[giggling, screeching]

35:54.453 --> 35:55.721
Carter?

35:57.656 --> 35:58.757
[gasping]

36:06.332 --> 36:08.634
It's OK, they know about us.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.337
We told all our secrets today.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.305
- How did you get in here?
- Leo gave me the keys.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.474
There's something that
I really need to tell you...

36:15.507 --> 36:18.310
I know. I know.
I'm so sorry about last night.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.646
- Me, too.
- It was all my fault.

36:20.679 --> 36:22.414
No, it was mine.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.452
Hey, can you two lovebirds
hash this out later?

36:26.485 --> 36:28.520
If Sasha catches him in here,
we're actually dead.

36:30.589 --> 36:33.325
- I'll call you later?
- OK.

36:36.262 --> 36:38.630
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.508
- So, who is Emily Kmetko?
- [sighing]

36:49.541 --> 36:51.577
Don't you have
somewhere to be?

36:51.610 --> 36:53.479
I'm sensing you don't
like talking about yourself.

36:53.512 --> 36:58.384
I'm sensing that your shift
was over a really long time ago.

36:58.417 --> 37:01.687
Ouch. Have you always
been such a snob?

37:01.720 --> 37:04.356
Have you always
been such an ass?

37:04.390 --> 37:06.792
I don't know. I was
told I was a sweet kid

37:06.825 --> 37:10.296
but I'm having
a hard time believing it.

37:10.329 --> 37:13.265
- Ditto.
- You don't like me.

37:13.299 --> 37:16.635
- I don't know you.
- So then, let's get to know
each other.

37:16.668 --> 37:19.271
Where'd you live
before you moved to Boulder?

37:19.305 --> 37:23.609
Fresno, San Diego, Vegas,
Tucson, Houston.

37:23.642 --> 37:25.311
My mom likes fresh starts.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.345
And your dad?

37:27.746 --> 37:29.281
Not in the picture.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.651
Was he ever?

37:32.684 --> 37:34.620
Not so much.

37:34.653 --> 37:38.424
Not exactly a stick-around
kind of guy, but not many
men are.

37:38.457 --> 37:41.293
- Am I sensing some man hate?
- Not hate.

37:41.327 --> 37:44.796
Just... observation
based on experience.

37:48.066 --> 37:52.671
So... how about you?

37:52.704 --> 37:55.307
Have you been
in Boulder your whole life?

37:55.341 --> 38:00.779
Ah, it feels like it. The minute
I'm 18, I'm outta here.

38:02.113 --> 38:04.650
- Where are you going?
- LA.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.485
Didn't you know,
I'm gonna be a rock star.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.821
It's gotta be hard
moving around all the time.

38:09.855 --> 38:12.491
Yeah, well, I've dealt with it.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.059
So you like being
an outsider.

38:14.092 --> 38:17.663
- I wouldn't say I like it.
- Sure you do.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.065
You can stand on the
sidelines and observe

38:20.098 --> 38:23.802
without having to belong because
that would mean exposing who you
really are.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.706
Somebody's been
watching a lot of Dr. Phil.

38:27.739 --> 38:30.742
[chuckling] Dr. Phil.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.712
It's gotta be difficult being
an outsider when you're a part
of a team,

38:33.745 --> 38:36.782
- at The Rock.
- How do you...

38:36.815 --> 38:39.618
Never mind, my mother
the blabbermouth.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.620
Give her a break.
She's proud of you.

38:41.653 --> 38:44.623
And don't worry.
I'm good at keeping secrets.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.826
I've really gotta
get out of here.
Do you know where Suzie is?

38:47.859 --> 38:51.730
Listen, I'll tell you what,
if you do a standing tuck
right here,

38:51.763 --> 38:55.867
- I'll cover for you.
- OK, how do you know
what a standing tuck is?

38:55.901 --> 38:57.803
'Cause I'm not stupid.

38:59.638 --> 39:02.741
- OK. So, if I do this...
- You're free to go.

39:12.584 --> 39:16.822
[people murmuring, clapping]

39:16.855 --> 39:19.458
Nice! Nice, that
was really good.

39:20.626 --> 39:21.927
You should see
my standing full twist.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.829
Hm. I'd love to.

39:28.800 --> 39:33.572
Did my mother say anything
else incredibly private or
embarrassing?

39:33.605 --> 39:36.408
No. Scout's honor.

39:36.442 --> 39:39.545
Why do I have a hard time
believing you were ever a
boy scout?

39:39.578 --> 39:41.713
Well, because you're
not a stupid girl.

39:42.848 --> 39:43.949
Thanks.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.787
So, what are you
gonna tell him?

39:54.560 --> 39:56.194
Looking good.

39:56.227 --> 39:57.729
The mats, that is.

40:09.841 --> 40:10.842
And Emily?

40:15.614 --> 40:16.882
Here I am.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.691
OK.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.961
I want to leave you with
something to think about.

40:29.995 --> 40:33.865
There's an old proverb that
says, "A candle loses nothing
by lighting another candle."

40:33.899 --> 40:38.837
That's what you're here to do:
light each other.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.906
Very good work today.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.913
I'll see tomorrow at five a.m.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.783
- [door closing]
- [all laughing]

40:53.752 --> 40:56.021
Hey, Kmetko. You're welcome
to get in on this.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.590
That's cool. I'm not really
that big on group hugs.

40:59.925 --> 41:03.829
All right, well
you asked for it.

41:03.862 --> 41:05.997
[screeching, laughing]

41:06.031 --> 41:08.500
[rock music]

41:11.670 --> 41:14.973
* It's a fantastic feeling

41:16.007 --> 41:17.976
[laughing]

41:26.317 --> 41:29.788
* What a fantastic feeling

41:29.821 --> 41:31.823
[indistinct chatter]

41:36.094 --> 41:38.697
- I'm glad
we're friends again.
- Me, too.

41:38.730 --> 41:41.299
I'm glad we're
all friend again.

41:41.332 --> 41:42.701
- Come here.
- [all chuckling]

41:43.735 --> 41:44.870
[Kaylie] I'm in the middle!

41:44.903 --> 41:47.673
- Bye.
- See ya, Emily.

41:47.706 --> 41:48.740
[Emily]
Bye, Payson.

41:48.774 --> 41:53.645
- How was your day?
- Great. How about you, Mom?

41:53.679 --> 41:55.914
It was interesting.

41:57.949 --> 42:01.720
How would you feel if
I started managing The Rock?

42:01.753 --> 42:05.657
- Ha! That's funny, Mom.
- Why is that funny?

42:05.691 --> 42:08.560
[* Miranda Lee Richards:
Breathless]

42:09.728 --> 42:13.565
- So, everything worked out OK?
- Yeah, thank God.

42:21.607 --> 42:23.842
That was really cool
of you to fill for me.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.977
If you hadn't, I would've
been fired. Thanks.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.779
You're welcome.
It was kinda fun.

42:27.813 --> 42:31.850
And that Damon boy is cute,
let me tell you. What do you
think?

42:31.883 --> 42:34.319
I think he's kinda
full of himself.

42:34.352 --> 42:37.122
Oh, and nice job on keeping
your mouth shut about The Rock.

42:37.155 --> 42:40.726
Honey, I'm really proud of you,
OK? It just kinda slipped out.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.094
- What else did you tell him?
- Nothing.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.764
- Mom?
- I swear. Nothing!

42:45.797 --> 42:47.065
- [Emily sighing]
- Come on!

42:48.967 --> 42:50.802
[sighing]

42:50.836 --> 42:54.606
- I offered to manage The Rock.
- Still mulling.

42:55.774 --> 42:57.843
Lauren?

42:57.876 --> 42:59.878
- Can I talk to you
for a second?
- Sure.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.813
I just...

43:01.847 --> 43:06.685
I wanted to say that
I feel awful about what
we did last night.

43:06.718 --> 43:08.854
And it was my fault.

43:08.887 --> 43:11.757
And I shouldn't have let
things get out of control.

43:11.790 --> 43:16.762
It was a mistake and I
take full responsibility.

43:16.795 --> 43:17.963
Relax.
It was no big deal.

43:17.996 --> 43:19.798
It's not like
it was my first time.

43:19.831 --> 43:23.702
Well, thanks for
not telling Kaylie.

43:23.735 --> 43:26.938
I didn't do it for you.
I did it for her.

43:26.972 --> 43:29.040
She's still my best friend.

43:30.909 --> 43:32.678
Right.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.783
Hey, did you happen to see
my cell phone last night?

43:37.816 --> 43:39.885
I went back today,
but it wasn't there.

43:39.918 --> 43:42.854
No. I guess you lost it.

43:44.823 --> 43:46.057
See ya.

43:46.091 --> 43:50.195
* And don't look down

43:50.228 --> 43:54.966
* You'll only scare yourself

43:55.000 --> 43:57.903
* Before I met you

43:57.936 --> 44:02.808
* My life
Was a series of chances *

44:02.841 --> 44:04.810
What was that all about?

44:04.843 --> 44:05.977
Nothing.

44:14.920 --> 44:16.855
Nothing at all.
