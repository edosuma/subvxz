00:02.503 --> 00:04.107
Tell me a story, Mr. Hawke.

00:04.171 --> 00:05.775
Tell me about Firestorm.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.981
Next, on Airwolf.

00:08.442 --> 00:09.512
Don't leave me!

00:09.576 --> 00:10.646
Easy, Eddie, easy.

00:10.711 --> 00:11.951
You remember I told you about the light?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.514
Well, this time it came back.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.786
Can't imagine anything being
out here we don't know about.

00:16.850 --> 00:19.126
Something’s throwing out interference.

00:20.053 --> 00:21.054
Get down!

00:22.623 --> 00:23.693
Hold on.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.536
Mother of God!

02:17.904 --> 02:20.180
Hey, there's nothing wrong with this chopper.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.844
It's got no pep, no pizzazz,

02:21.908 --> 02:23.649
I'm telling you, it's got no beans.

02:23.710 --> 02:26.350
Well, it's not Airwolf,
but that's not your problem.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.050
That's the subject we should be discussing.

02:29.182 --> 02:32.061
Any piece of machinery
gets rusty unless you use it.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
Dom, that's a very special piece of machinery.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.201
You don't just taxi it around.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.328
Regular maintenance flights,
that's all I'm proposing.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.497
You're incurable.

02:41.128 --> 02:42.732
I miss my baby.

02:42.963 --> 02:46.240
What the hell do you do with a man
who falls in love with a machine?

03:18.632 --> 03:19.702
Hey, String.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.040
Ev, how you doing?

03:21.101 --> 03:23.877
Good timing. You just got a call, Mr. Santini.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.110
- Angie, down at Four Corners.
- Oh, thanks, Ev.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.311
You got it.

03:32.079 --> 03:33.615
Keep me company?

03:36.616 --> 03:38.323
Mother Santini.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.989
I swear, you're gonna qualify for sainthood.

04:04.311 --> 04:08.817
They are out there, and nobody listens.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.793
Nobody listens!

04:11.952 --> 04:15.456
There's something going on, there's lights,

04:16.389 --> 04:18.391
and don't nobody say different.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.527
You're gonna be damn straight about that.

04:20.594 --> 04:21.937
Nothing gets past me.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.032
Instead of the shot, Eddie,
how about a sandwich?

04:24.097 --> 04:25.838
I make a mean ham on rye.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.816
What are you looking at?

04:33.373 --> 04:36.616
Hey, you think I'm maybe crazy
or something, is that right?

04:36.843 --> 04:38.447
What, are you deaf?

04:39.012 --> 04:41.424
Hey, I'm just minding my own business, okay?

04:41.481 --> 04:42.892
Eddie, leave it alone.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.326
Soldier?

04:45.285 --> 04:48.823
Weekend warrior. I was a
soldier. I'm telling you…

04:48.889 --> 04:51.165
Come on, don't. Hey, let
me pour you another beer.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.295
There is something out there in the desert.

04:53.360 --> 04:55.203
Lights on at night.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.171
Hey, I'm talking to you!

04:57.230 --> 04:59.232
Okay. Whatever you say.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.114
I'm gonna kill you now!

05:06.072 --> 05:09.212
Hey, stop it! Come on.

05:09.276 --> 05:10.778
Come on, come on, you guys.

05:10.844 --> 05:12.118
3 on 1.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.749
Come on, nice guy.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.725
Hey, he picked it, not me.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.353
Hey, look, why don't you guys just
sit down and enjoy your drinks.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.261
Come on, let's get some fresh air.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.095
Yeah, why'd you call Laurel and Hardy here?

05:22.155 --> 05:25.068
Eddie, every time you start
muttering about UFO's…

05:25.125 --> 05:26.160
I didn't say that.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.899
I know what's coming next.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.599
All right, all right, come on.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.404
You won another war. Let's go.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.875
I don't need a nursemaid!

05:32.933 --> 05:34.378
Why don't you guys get lost?

05:36.169 --> 05:37.648
I'll follow you.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.273
Follow yourself. I'll be fine.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.377
If I need a ride I'll phone
one of my friends from Mars.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.421
Look, you're not gonna get behind that wheel.

05:45.478 --> 05:46.821
- Give me those.
- Come on.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.223
Now, look, I'm your friend,

05:48.281 --> 05:50.818
but you want me to break your arm to prove it?

05:50.884 --> 05:52.420
Now, come on, get in there.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.644
Come on, Eddie, let's go.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.511
There you go.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.719
Dominic, how many times has it
been that you put me to bed?

06:55.782 --> 06:58.353
How many times have you promised to give up?

06:58.451 --> 07:01.227
You just think I'm a drunk with the DTs.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.925
But I… I'm not a lush that sees bugs,

07:05.025 --> 07:08.734
I see things in the desert.

07:11.865 --> 07:16.007
Yeah, the only monster is the
bottle from outer space.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.011
I see things

07:19.472 --> 07:21.383
in the desert at night.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.920
Sure you do, Eddie. Sure you do.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.809
You making this a life's work?

07:53.606 --> 07:57.213
Believe it or not, under all
that booze is a good man.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.756
Or once upon a time, he was.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.292
Yeah, once upon a time.

08:06.386 --> 08:08.764
Of course, you and I are perfect.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.130
Of course.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.542
Bottoms up.

09:27.867 --> 09:29.437
Oh, baby.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.029
Oh, no.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.270
No! Stop!

10:32.332 --> 10:33.834
Go away!

10:35.401 --> 10:37.745
No! No!

10:40.707 --> 10:43.278
No! No! Get out!

11:36.062 --> 11:38.167
You look like hell, you know that?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.972
I didn't wanna show up my friends.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.073
I just thought I'd drop by to
see if you needed anything.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.779
Couple of magazines here and…

11:49.142 --> 11:50.815
Thanks a lot, Dominic.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.223
I'm sorry I can't shake your hand.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.299
You know, the booze had worn off
by the time they found you.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.562
And still, you were yelling

12:08.628 --> 12:10.630
that snakes were crawling all over your body…

12:10.697 --> 12:12.108
Yeah, Dom, I know the story.

12:12.165 --> 12:13.769
You gotta get rid of that habit.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.404
You gotta knock it off, or you're gonna die.

12:16.469 --> 12:17.743
You gotta quit, Ed.

12:17.804 --> 12:20.182
Maybe this time I'll dream of dancing girls.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.413
What the hell's the use?

12:22.542 --> 12:24.749
You wanna commit suicide, go ahead.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.583
Last night you fell in a ditch.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.524
Maybe next time you'll hit your hard
head just a little bit harder…

12:32.752 --> 12:35.426
Hey Dominic, I wanna thank you.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.624
Thank you very much.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.169
Oh, it's nothing.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.903
I just want to know if I
can do anything for you.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.739
Uh-uh, no.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.037
Just get well, will ya?

12:48.101 --> 12:50.581
Get well, you dumb donkey.

12:52.939 --> 12:57.149
Dominic. Dominic, I didn't fall in
a ditch. That is not what happened.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.053
There was this thing.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.349
- Come on, come on.
- Dominic.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.791
You gotta calm down, will you?

13:03.850 --> 13:05.386
- I swear to God, you…
- Eddie.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.453
- I swear to God. You gotta listen to me.
- Calm down.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.466
- You gotta listen to me, Dominic.
- Calm down.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.523
You remember I told you about the light?

13:10.590 --> 13:11.933
Well, this time it came back.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.437
And not far this time. It came for me.

13:14.494 --> 13:15.666
Easy, Eddie, easy.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.207
It was blinding me.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.068
And the sound, the sound was so bad.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.705
I felt like my head was gonna
crack open from the pain!

13:23.770 --> 13:25.841
- You gotta believe me!
- Call Dr. Fredrickson.

13:25.905 --> 13:27.748
- I believe you.
- You don't believe me.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.514
- I believe you.
- Dominic, don't leave me!

13:29.575 --> 13:30.986
- Sir, please.
- All right, all right.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.614
- I believe you, Eddie.
- I felt it inside of me!

13:32.679 --> 13:36.320
Dominic, you gotta believe it
was nothing like this earth.

13:36.382 --> 13:39.295
I swear to it! You gotta believe me!

13:40.353 --> 13:43.994
Dominic, it's like nothing on
this earth, I swear to you.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.133
Come on, Dom.

13:46.359 --> 13:49.203
Eddie's a nice guy, I like
him too, but he's a drunk.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.333
I mean, who knows what he sees. Pink elephants?

13:51.397 --> 13:53.001
Well, if he says he saw something,

13:53.066 --> 13:54.773
then I say we ought to
check that something out,

13:54.834 --> 13:56.336
as a favor to me.

13:57.203 --> 13:58.705
You know, when he first started talking

13:58.771 --> 14:00.216
about these things he was seeing in the desert,

14:00.273 --> 14:01.684
you drove out there.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.118
And what did you find? Nothin’.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.156
That's a big desert, String.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.054
There's miles and miles of miles
and miles, you know that.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.855
And if you're gonna take a look around

14:09.916 --> 14:12.760
there's only one way to
cover that kind of country.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.498
You're incurable.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.791
I miss our baby.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.070
Hey, wait for me.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.252
Ready?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.625
Ready.

15:11.744 --> 15:14.623
I don't see much out there but cactus.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.284
An old abandoned mine.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.155
We're just spitting distance from the lair.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.892
I can't imagine anything being
out there we don't know about.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.490
Yeah, the scope's out,

15:23.556 --> 15:26.036
like something’s throwing out interference.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.038
What did I tell you about maintenance?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.971
Especially with this little lady.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.476
She's a prototype of which
there ain't any other.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.269
Parts break down, you know.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.143
Well, then we'll run video.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.310
Just like they did back in your day.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.045
Stick it in your hat.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.494
Run infrared, thermal, and standard.

16:00.493 --> 16:03.167
Infrared, thermal, and standard.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.166
We're approaching the mining camp.

16:05.231 --> 16:07.074
Let's start taking pictures.

16:22.849 --> 16:27.628
You know, all anybody sees
now in him is an old rummy,

16:27.687 --> 16:30.930
but Eddie Donahough was one of
the best pilots I ever saw.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.631
There was a crash and a
lot of people were hurt.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.133
It was a mechanical malfunction,

16:37.196 --> 16:39.733
but go tell Eddie about the screams.

16:41.067 --> 16:44.207
The doctors managed to put
everything back together again.

16:44.570 --> 16:46.311
Everything but his nerve.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.316
He tried to fly again, but he couldn't.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.552
After a while, all he wanted to do

16:56.782 --> 16:58.159
was disappear.

16:58.217 --> 16:59.525
What are you gonna do about it?

16:59.585 --> 17:00.825
I don't know.

17:01.087 --> 17:03.294
I suppose when I pick him up
at the hospital tonight

17:03.356 --> 17:06.394
I'll give him lecture number 111.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.230
Good luck.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.814
Yeah, that should get us a good look.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.553
I appreciate it, String.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.788
Let's head home and see what we got.

17:36.923 --> 17:39.529
Dom, I want you to know
I really appreciate this.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.835
I don't wanna hear that. All I want
to hear is that you're getting’ well.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.636
- Yeah.
- You know, it doesn't mean you can...

17:44.697 --> 17:47.075
- You hear what I'm tellin’ ya?
- Yeah, yeah. Yes.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.613
Don't give me the "Yeah, yeah, yes, yes."

17:49.869 --> 17:51.780
Other people have beaten this!

17:52.171 --> 17:54.583
You can, too, if you just get rid of the stuff.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.586
Then you won't see monsters out there anymore.

17:56.642 --> 17:59.919
Well, good night and thanks a lot, Dom.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.185
Okay.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.338
Now I'm not so crazy, huh?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.462
I'm not so crazy, huh?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.435
You see, I told you!

18:54.600 --> 18:55.738
Get down!

20:00.166 --> 20:01.804
Hey, Ev, you know where Dom's hiding?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.471
No. I was looking for him myself, earlier.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.641
I know last night he was
headed down to Eddie's place.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.881
Say, listen, if you see him tell him I
need authorization for these new parts.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.551
Yeah, I'll tell him.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.474
Hold it right there! You're trespassing!

23:52.097 --> 23:53.235
Get in the jeep.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.247
Dr. Grays to the launch pad.

24:37.376 --> 24:39.617
Dr. Grays to the launch pad.

24:50.389 --> 24:54.496
All crews, please notify your Section
Chief before leaving the compound.

24:54.660 --> 24:59.109
I repeat, all crews, check in with
your Section Chiefs before leaving.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.774
All coordinates confirmed, General.

25:20.085 --> 25:22.122
What do you want here, Mr. Hawke?

25:23.622 --> 25:24.760
You know me?

25:24.823 --> 25:26.359
Let's say we make it our business

25:26.425 --> 25:27.904
to know who's who in the neighborhood.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.371
Now, what do you want here?

25:29.428 --> 25:31.465
You've got a friend of mine here.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.877
Tell me a story, Mr. Hawke.

25:36.001 --> 25:38.413
Tell me about Firestorm.

25:42.174 --> 25:44.211
Firestorm, Mr. Hawke.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.653
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.351
Bamboo shoots under the fingernails are passé.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.626
But in a few moments you will tell me

26:26.685 --> 26:28.824
all I want to know about Firestorm,

26:29.721 --> 26:31.894
or about Stringfellow Hawke,

26:31.957 --> 26:33.903
or anything else I want to know.

26:41.166 --> 26:42.167
I…

26:43.702 --> 26:45.181
I think I know you.

26:47.172 --> 26:49.243
Tell me a story, Mr. Hawke.

26:49.942 --> 26:51.819
Tell me about Firestorm.

27:05.057 --> 27:06.934
Tell me a story, Mr. Hawke.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.097
Tell me about Firestorm.

27:12.164 --> 27:14.303
Talk to me, come on.

27:15.701 --> 27:16.975
I don't know.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.878
Your friend Eddie

27:20.072 --> 27:23.076
liked to talk about lights
in the desert, didn't he?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.621
Eddie,

27:26.345 --> 27:27.847
Eddie's a drunk.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.924
A resilient drunk. A drunk with a voice.

27:31.049 --> 27:33.256
We thought we'd killed him.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.432
What did he tell you?

27:37.523 --> 27:40.697
Lights were out of this world.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.372
Any more could kill him.

27:59.978 --> 28:02.390
Firestorm, Mr. Hawke.

28:02.714 --> 28:03.920
What did your friend see?

28:03.982 --> 28:05.120
What does he know?

28:05.184 --> 28:07.095
Did you tell anyone else?

28:07.219 --> 28:09.165
Who will be following you here?

28:20.933 --> 28:23.243
Firestorm.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.959
Are you still with us, Mr. Hawke?

28:49.761 --> 28:51.934
America is on fire, from within and without.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.103
It's a firestorm, and make no
mistake, it will engulf us all.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.909
You're Sand…

28:57.970 --> 28:59.677
The enemy is winning the war from within.

28:59.738 --> 29:01.945
They've subverted our media, our youth.

29:02.007 --> 29:05.284
The time is now or never
for a surgical first strike.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.517
Guy scares me to death.

29:09.848 --> 29:11.486
Sandhower.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.619
Talk to me, Mr. Hawke.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.123
What is your connection with
the intelligence community?

29:17.189 --> 29:18.497
General Sandhower.

29:18.557 --> 29:19.831
It's now "Mister.".

29:19.891 --> 29:22.462
Mr. Sandhower, you have been
relieved as a General of the Army

29:22.527 --> 29:24.438
because of your extreme views.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.500
All I will say is God bless America.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.705
And God help her.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.044
Will you now retire to private life, sir?

29:32.104 --> 29:34.812
I will serve my country, my way.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.885
I'm a soldier. And I'll save you once more.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.461
You're him.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.428
I'll make one final statement.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.092
Day by day America plays the peacemaker,

29:50.155 --> 29:51.862
while the enemy grows stronger.

29:51.923 --> 29:54.665
Now, ultimately, where do
you think this will lead?

29:54.726 --> 29:57.502
I will tell you. To a…

29:57.929 --> 29:59.374
Firestorm.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.771
You're Sandhower.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.475
Tell me a story, Mr. Hawke.

30:23.889 --> 30:26.028
Get up. Walk around.

30:26.558 --> 30:28.538
It takes a while to wear off.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.700
All crews, please notify your Section Chief

30:33.765 --> 30:35.608
before leaving the compound.

30:35.934 --> 30:40.713
I repeat, All crews, check in with
your Section Chiefs before leaving.

30:53.485 --> 30:56.022
Am I the guy who said you
were seeing pink elephants?

30:56.088 --> 30:57.499
All is forgiven. Now what?

30:57.556 --> 30:59.297
Anybody know you're here?

30:59.758 --> 31:03.331
Well, I couldn't go show the
pictures around we took from Airwolf.

31:04.129 --> 31:06.336
That guy Sandhower is crazy.

31:06.398 --> 31:09.811
He may seem crazy, but he
knows what he's doing.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.978
Did they bring you past a
missile on the way in?

31:13.739 --> 31:16.549
Would you believe it's nuclear armed?

31:17.309 --> 31:19.550
And they're getting ready to fire it,

31:19.611 --> 31:21.613
at Moscow, no less.

31:26.084 --> 31:29.691
A tactical first strike. World War III.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.059
You got it.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.926
Dr. Anderson, to the launch pad.

31:33.992 --> 31:36.768
Dr. Anderson, to the launch pad.

31:43.435 --> 31:44.743
Is that the only guard?

31:44.803 --> 31:46.146
Yeah, and he's armed.

31:46.204 --> 31:48.775
Boy, I need a straightener. I need a drink!

31:54.079 --> 31:55.888
You and your damn drunken friend.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.517
Hey, lay off!

31:57.582 --> 31:59.061
Your friend's a lousy lush.

31:59.117 --> 32:00.562
Cut it out, in there!

32:00.619 --> 32:02.292
Who are you calling a lush?

32:04.156 --> 32:06.636
Your drunken friend is gonna get us killed!

32:09.861 --> 32:11.704
Drunken old fart.

32:36.021 --> 32:37.261
- Okay.
- Freeze!

32:44.796 --> 32:48.403
- Thanks.
- You take that jeep. I'll give you cover.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.749
Stop them. Stop them!

32:59.444 --> 33:00.514
Stop them!

33:18.230 --> 33:19.607
Get out of the way!

33:21.800 --> 33:22.904
String!

33:35.213 --> 33:36.590
Set for launch!

33:36.648 --> 33:38.889
But you said you were
going to alert the media.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.361
They'll know it soon enough.

33:40.418 --> 33:43.024
But we have to explain. We have a purpose.

33:44.890 --> 33:46.494
Alert the launch crew.

33:47.926 --> 33:49.963
I said hurry, eject this!

33:50.028 --> 33:51.268
Get outta here.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.104
I'll pick you up at the trailer.

33:53.164 --> 33:54.472
Get outta here!

33:54.533 --> 33:55.773
Go on, go on!

34:19.623 --> 34:22.434
Disconnect the umbilical lines.
Make ready to launch.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.458
Attention, stand by for countdown.

34:43.514 --> 34:46.121
Repeat, stand by for countdown.

35:27.592 --> 35:29.469
We made it! Dom, we made it!

35:30.195 --> 35:31.401
We made it!

35:31.963 --> 35:33.169
Dom?

35:33.598 --> 35:36.340
Dom, you okay? Dom, you all right?

35:38.970 --> 35:42.144
- Can you get me inside?
- Sure, sure, sure. Put your leg there.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.949
Come on. The other leg, come on.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.316
Easy does it.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.481
We made it, baby.

35:51.082 --> 35:52.618
Put your arm up here.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.761
Take it easy. Just easy.

37:08.460 --> 37:09.939
Yeah, thanks.

37:10.562 --> 37:13.042
Mercy General's on its way.

37:13.098 --> 37:17.478
Now, let's improvise a little first aid here.

37:17.702 --> 37:19.545
Eddie, no booze.

37:19.604 --> 37:20.810
No lectures, Dom,

37:20.872 --> 37:24.081
we have been through one hell of
an afternoon of activity, pal.

37:24.142 --> 37:29.091
Eddie, just sit down and shut up and listen.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.720
I'm listening, I'm listening.

37:32.784 --> 37:36.231
Eddie, if String got away, he's gone for help.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.789
You think they'll get there in time?

37:37.856 --> 37:39.529
There's no "they."

37:39.591 --> 37:43.505
You and him are gonna have to
get rid of that madman yourselves.

37:43.595 --> 37:46.940
Me? Hey Dom, me?

37:46.998 --> 37:48.978
He can't do it alone.

37:50.602 --> 37:51.910
Dom, look at me.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.951
You're gonna have to help him fly, Eddie.

37:55.006 --> 37:56.144
Fly?

37:56.875 --> 37:59.116
No way. No way.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.653
It's only a chopper, sort of.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.134
Here they come. They're coming after us.

38:13.191 --> 38:14.295
You've gotta help.

38:14.359 --> 38:15.861
We've gotta get outta here.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.565
- Here, come on.
- Help me.

38:17.662 --> 38:18.834
- Put your hand…
- Help me up.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.240
My shoulder, here.

38:20.298 --> 38:23.541
Going out here. Come on.

38:23.601 --> 38:26.605
- No, no. Put me down.
- Easy now.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.927
Never seen anything like it.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.529
Dom, you okay?

39:56.127 --> 39:58.664
- Did you call for help?
- Yeah, and they're on their way.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.505
Meet your new copilot.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.873
What are you talking about, Dom?

40:01.933 --> 40:03.207
I can't fly that plane.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.077
I'm sorry, I can't help you,

40:05.136 --> 40:07.912
but I'd probably be unconscious
when you needed me.

40:07.972 --> 40:11.476
I can't fly that. I haven't flown in
10 years. What're you saying, Dominic?

40:11.542 --> 40:12.953
Hey, you've seen what's going on out there.

40:13.011 --> 40:15.116
We got one chance in a million to stop them.

40:15.179 --> 40:18.558
If I go alone, we got none.
You just do what I say.

40:19.317 --> 40:20.625
Dom, I can't go.

40:20.685 --> 40:25.100
Eddie, you've always kept crying
that you wanted to turn it around

40:25.156 --> 40:26.999
if I hung in there with you.

40:27.125 --> 40:31.471
But now, now's your chance.
Go on, turn it around.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.065
Go on, boy.

40:35.667 --> 40:38.079
I can't. I can't do it.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.212
Oh, forget it.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.287
All right. All right, I'll go.

41:23.681 --> 41:25.354
Hold on.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.593
Mother of God!

41:32.156 --> 41:34.659
3 minutes and counting down.

41:37.095 --> 41:39.302
Unidentified aircraft approaching.

41:39.364 --> 41:42.743
Approximately 18 miles out, speed Mach 1-plus.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.906
That fast, it's military.
They got the word out.

41:45.970 --> 41:47.643
No matter. We have Air Defense Systems.

41:47.705 --> 41:49.651
Now's the time to use them. Go!

41:56.481 --> 41:57.926
Launch as scheduled.

41:57.982 --> 42:00.428
2 minutes and 30, counting down.

42:05.923 --> 42:08.631
Can't count on me. It's flying too fast.

42:08.826 --> 42:10.897
Listen, I can fly this bird all by myself.

42:10.962 --> 42:12.771
I just need you to bring the weapons on line.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.208
Anyone who depends on a drunk is a fool.

42:15.299 --> 42:17.939
Unless you gotta count on that
drunk to save millions of lives.

42:18.002 --> 42:19.572
Buddy, you're it.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.014
Rockets. Rockets!

42:26.644 --> 42:28.021
We'll be killed.

42:29.981 --> 42:32.825
The panel on the right, It
says "sunburst." Pop one now.

42:32.884 --> 42:34.227
On the right. What?

42:34.285 --> 42:36.788
On the right, it says "sunburst," give me one.

42:47.799 --> 42:49.335
Give me another one.

43:09.887 --> 43:11.525
I thought we were goners.

43:13.057 --> 43:15.094
It's no time to celebrate yet.

43:15.827 --> 43:16.897
What is it?

43:16.961 --> 43:18.497
They've got ignition.

43:18.896 --> 43:20.773
I'm gonna lock on.

43:28.072 --> 43:30.746
Gotta get it while it's on
the ground. Bring up a Falcon.

43:30.808 --> 43:32.845
That panel, right in front
of you, you remember?

43:32.910 --> 43:34.548
Right.

43:36.447 --> 43:37.619
Fire.

43:55.166 --> 43:56.804
We have liftoff!

44:33.804 --> 44:35.613
We did it.

44:39.310 --> 44:40.880
We sure did, Eddie.

44:41.579 --> 44:43.616
Yes, we sure did.

44:53.124 --> 44:55.627
Government spokesmen today confirmed reports

44:55.693 --> 45:00.039
about the nuclear test in the
remote Crystal Sands desert basin.

45:00.831 --> 45:03.368
It is stressed that the test
was routine in nature

45:03.434 --> 45:07.610
and did not constitute any shift
in administration policy.

45:07.939 --> 45:11.648
In other news from Washington,
your taxes are going up…

45:13.377 --> 45:15.983
Well, Eddie, here you are.

45:16.047 --> 45:18.721
Well, guys, it was a great experience.

45:18.783 --> 45:21.525
But the next time you go,
don't call me, I'll call you.

45:21.586 --> 45:23.190
Oh, you loved it.

45:23.254 --> 45:25.700
Yeah, you did good, Eddie.
Present and accounted for.

45:25.756 --> 45:29.397
I got to admit I felt
pretty good in that machine.

45:29.460 --> 45:32.669
You know, it'd be probably the
best not to mention the machine.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.868
I understand.

45:33.931 --> 45:38.175
Now, you dumb donkey, you know
what it is to get it all together?

45:38.402 --> 45:40.177
I'm gonna be trying.

45:40.338 --> 45:43.683
Trying? I'm gonna take this one
good wing and I'm gonna...

45:43.741 --> 45:46.221
Uh-uh, we wouldn't want that would we?

45:49.981 --> 45:51.619
See ya.

46:15.940 --> 46:19.786
Eddie, I forgot to tell you, we're gonna…

46:26.484 --> 46:27.758
Eddie,

46:29.754 --> 46:31.859
nobody can live your life for you.

46:34.325 --> 46:36.601
You have to figure it out for yourself.

46:38.496 --> 46:41.602
When you do, call me.
