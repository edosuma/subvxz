18:45.667 --> 18:47.959
fuck.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.250
I swear to God,
I look back, and I'm like...

18:51.792 --> 18:53.667
I finally started
seeing this shrink.

18:53.667 --> 18:55.125
- Little late.
- Probably.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.959
Anyway, she seems smart.
I don't know.

18:56.959 --> 18:59.625
Mostly, we talk about you.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.792
Good.

19:00.792 --> 19:03.500
Even she couldn't believe
some of the shit I pulled.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.208
She says that's what I do
when I'm in love.

19:05.208 --> 19:08.375
It's some kind
of abandonment thing

19:08.375 --> 19:10.500
and all kinds of crap
with my father.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
Wait.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.792
You were in love?

19:12.792 --> 19:13.875
Oh, come on.

19:13.875 --> 19:14.792
Really?

19:14.792 --> 19:16.333
You knew that.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.834
- Nope.
- Yeah, you did.

19:17.834 --> 19:20.125
You never said it.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.166
- But you knew it.
- I did not.

19:22.166 --> 19:25.125
Come on.
Of course I love you.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.542
Loved. Loved.

19:26.542 --> 19:30.792
Da. Da.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.959
Fine.

19:35.959 --> 19:36.500
Love.

19:36.500 --> 19:37.625
[sniffles briefly]

19:38.834 --> 19:39.875
Really?

19:39.875 --> 19:42.041
I miss you so fucking much.

19:42.041 --> 19:42.333
I miss you too.

19:55.417 --> 19:58.333
[woman] Excuse me?
Um, can you keep talking?

19:58.333 --> 20:00.208
[woman] 'Cause I'm never
gonna be able to pee

20:00.208 --> 20:02.250

20:02.250 --> 20:03.291
[both] Sorry.

20:05.834 --> 20:06.333
Better?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.041
[woman] Thank you.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.208
I think about you all the time.

20:12.208 --> 20:13.959

I think about you too.

20:13.959 --> 20:15.166
Oh, my God.

20:15.166 --> 20:17.125
I can't even sleep
in my bed anymore.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.291
It's too depressing.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.375
That makes me so happy.

20:20.375 --> 20:23.959
And then that fucking movie
Carol  came out.

20:23.959 --> 20:26.083
I mean, seriously?

20:26.083 --> 20:28.375
Those two women,
and it's so hot,

20:28.375 --> 20:29.959
and it's called Carol?

20:29.959 --> 20:33.208
It fucking killed me.

20:33.208 --> 20:33.750
Aww.

20:33.750 --> 20:36.500

20:36.500 --> 20:38.000
I thought it was
kind of slow.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.417
It was slow.

20:39.417 --> 20:40.375
Yeah.

20:43.792 --> 20:48.625
I never gave you back
one of your T-shirts.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.917
It still smells like you.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.542
Oh, like in a gross way?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.625
No, not in a gross way.

20:54.041 --> 20:55.583
Which one?

20:55.583 --> 20:57.208
The blue James Perse.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.625
Oh, Jesus.

20:58.625 --> 21:00.542
I've been looking
all over for that.

21:00.542 --> 21:02.166

- No.

21:02.166 --> 21:03.291
- You sure?
- Yeah.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.917
I mean, if you want it--

- Really?

21:18.125 --> 21:19.834

21:19.834 --> 21:20.917
No.

21:20.917 --> 21:22.500
[woman] I have a mint!

21:22.500 --> 21:24.250
- Thank you.
- That's okay!

21:33.875 --> 21:34.959
[sighs]

21:34.959 --> 21:37.750
I want another chance.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.792
- No.
- No, it wouldn't be like--

21:39.792 --> 21:41.041
No. I can't.

21:42.792 --> 21:45.583
You wrecked me.

21:45.583 --> 21:48.166
I'm so fuckin' sorry.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.959
Look, if I could undo
everything--

21:50.959 --> 21:52.041
but if there's any way

21:52.041 --> 21:54.458
you'll let me show you

21:54.458 --> 21:56.250
that I don't have to be
that person--

21:56.250 --> 21:56.583
Oh, fuck it.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.000
All right.

22:08.000 --> 22:11.959
But if--
if we open this door again--

22:11.959 --> 22:13.000
Oh, please!

22:13.000 --> 22:14.583
Let's open the door.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.125
- Open the door!
- [laughs]

22:15.125 --> 22:17.500

22:17.500 --> 22:18.667
- If.
- Right.

22:18.667 --> 22:21.917
We are gonna take it slow.

22:21.917 --> 22:23.500
Absolutely.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.792
Slow.

22:26.166 --> 22:28.500
We're getting a dog."

22:28.500 --> 22:29.709
Totally.
Slow.

22:29.709 --> 22:31.917
Slow.

22:31.917 --> 22:33.667
We don't even have to sleep
together until--

22:33.667 --> 22:35.291
Well, I'm not saying that.

22:35.291 --> 22:37.000
[laughs]

22:37.000 --> 22:38.709
So this is happening?

22:38.709 --> 22:40.875
Slowly.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.667
But happening?

22:42.667 --> 22:43.959
But happening.

You made us a turd?

Yeah.

about me being like my father,

24:14.917 --> 24:16.667
and I fuckin' hate it.

24:17.667 --> 24:20.875
My father walked out on us,

24:20.875 --> 24:22.792
I fuckin' walked out on you.

I didn't know if you were
headed back home or not,

24:26.750 --> 24:28.375

we were doing the new show?

that's happened--

25:23.792 --> 25:25.667
You have treated us
so horrendously,

25:25.667 --> 25:28.834
and then you expect us
to just take you back?
