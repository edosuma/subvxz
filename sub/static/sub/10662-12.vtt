00:00.593 --> 00:05.330
The Carmichael Show is taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:05.331 --> 00:09.001
What the reverend said today
was absolutely disgusting!

00:09.002 --> 00:10.435
It was vile!

00:10.436 --> 00:12.070
If he'd said that 1,000 years ago,

00:12.071 --> 00:14.306
the church would've
hung him for heresy!

00:14.307 --> 00:17.009
Okay, Mom, well, I think you
are tremendously overstating

00:17.010 --> 00:20.078
what happened here today
and being quite irrational.

00:20.079 --> 00:21.913
No, I am not.

00:21.914 --> 00:23.057
Okay, well, I think you are.

00:23.058 --> 00:24.383
No, you do not.

00:24.384 --> 00:26.151
All right, well...

00:26.152 --> 00:28.186
I think it was pretty
brave of the reverend

00:28.187 --> 00:30.389
to get up there in front
of the congregation

00:30.390 --> 00:32.524
and admit he'd been
battling a porn addiction.

00:32.525 --> 00:36.528
Boy, oh, boy what that
reverend did today was brave!

00:36.529 --> 00:38.330
Somebody needs to make a meme of him

00:38.331 --> 00:40.299
standing in front of a tank
in Tiananmen square.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.534
Joe, it was

00:42.535 --> 00:44.770
not brave, it was disgusting.

00:44.771 --> 00:46.071
Not to mention

00:46.072 --> 00:48.305
the children had to hear that filth!

00:49.374 --> 00:50.575
Man, this is the first time

00:50.576 --> 00:53.578
I haven't fell asleep
in church in years.

00:53.579 --> 00:55.881
I wonder what the reverend
gonna confess to next week.

00:55.882 --> 00:57.783
I hope it's tax evasion.

00:57.784 --> 00:59.818
You know, tax evasion
is sexy right now.

00:59.819 --> 01:03.088
I loved how open and
honest that reverend was.

01:03.089 --> 01:04.855
Is church always this interesting?

01:04.857 --> 01:07.059
It's not supposed to be
interesting, Maxine.

01:07.060 --> 01:10.829
It's church. It's not a TED Talk.

01:10.830 --> 01:12.564
I wonder what type of pornography

01:12.565 --> 01:14.499
the reverend watches.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.502
I would've asked, but he never
opened the floor to questions.

01:17.503 --> 01:19.738
All right, well, hold on
to your question, Bobby.

01:19.739 --> 01:21.573
Maybe you'll get a chance
to ask it next week.

01:21.574 --> 01:23.475
Okay, look here, Jerrod,
if that's sarcasm,

01:23.476 --> 01:25.277
I don't appreciate it, okay?

01:25.278 --> 01:29.448
You stifle my curiosity,
and that belittles us both.

01:29.449 --> 01:32.951
Reverend Carlson is
supposed to be a leader.

01:32.952 --> 01:37.889
I've turned to him for moral
guidance for over 35 years.

01:37.890 --> 01:40.726
Now I'm gonna have to figure out

01:40.727 --> 01:43.795
where I can find a new
church home for every Sunday

01:43.796 --> 01:46.998
and Wednesday and Thursday.

01:46.999 --> 01:50.302
My entire social
calendar is in shambles.

01:50.303 --> 01:51.870
Well, Mom, you don't

01:51.871 --> 01:53.975
have to leave the church
just because the reverend

01:53.976 --> 01:55.639
admitted something
honest and made himself

01:55.640 --> 01:57.342
vulnerable to the congregation.

01:57.343 --> 02:00.912
Well, I can't think of a better
reason to leave a church.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.815
Sounds like somebody
hasn't seen <i>Spotlight.</i>

02:03.816 --> 02:05.359
Well, I don't think it's as big a deal

02:05.360 --> 02:06.885
as y'all are making it out to be.

02:06.886 --> 02:08.687
The reverend just admitted
to doing something

02:08.687 --> 02:12.057
that's perfectly normal
that every man does.

02:12.058 --> 02:14.526
Joe, how you gonna sit there
and say it was perfectly normal,

02:14.527 --> 02:16.328
something that every man does?

02:16.329 --> 02:18.462
You don't watch porno.

02:24.536 --> 02:26.003
Joe?

02:27.539 --> 02:29.907
You watch porno, Joe?

02:32.677 --> 02:35.147
Daddy?

02:35.148 --> 02:37.182
Well, you know what?

02:37.183 --> 02:39.684
I'm tired of being
ashamed anyway, damn it.

02:39.685 --> 02:42.354
And if this reverend can find
the strength to come clean,

02:42.355 --> 02:44.589
so can I.

02:44.590 --> 02:46.324
Joe Carmichael watches porn.

02:46.325 --> 02:47.791
There, I said it.

02:53.498 --> 02:55.633
Bobby!

02:56.668 --> 02:58.802

Subtitle sync and corrections by

03:11.389 --> 03:16.326
Joe, you are a sexual deviant,
just like my reverend.

03:16.327 --> 03:19.062
I'm not no sexual deviant.

03:19.063 --> 03:20.697
I don't watch anything too hard-core.

03:20.698 --> 03:22.732
I'm mostly into...

03:22.733 --> 03:25.000
lesbian stuff.

03:26.236 --> 03:28.338
Look, I enjoy the supple,
gentle nature of women.

03:28.339 --> 03:29.305
Joe!

03:29.306 --> 03:32.175
Look, Ma, Dad's right.

03:32.176 --> 03:34.944
It's not really that big of a deal.

03:34.945 --> 03:36.980
I know this is a weird thing to admit

03:36.981 --> 03:39.315
in front of your whole family, but...

03:39.316 --> 03:41.284
I watch porn, too, Ma.

03:41.285 --> 03:42.786
God.

03:42.787 --> 03:46.089
That is a weird sentence
to say out loud.

03:46.090 --> 03:49.259
Oh, no, Jerrod, not you!

03:49.260 --> 03:52.529
Maxine, did you know about this?

03:52.530 --> 03:55.765
I mean, we've never really
talked about it, but I assumed.

03:55.766 --> 03:58.133
That's why I always knock
before I enter our bedroom.

03:59.869 --> 04:01.404
Bobby.

04:01.405 --> 04:06.309
Sweet, innocent, pure-spirited Bobby.

04:06.310 --> 04:10.079
Tell me you don't watch pornography.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.283
Okay, Mama, you're putting
me in a tough spot.

04:13.284 --> 04:16.119
Uh, I don't want to lie to you,

04:16.120 --> 04:18.387
but I don't want to let you down.

04:18.389 --> 04:20.390
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna say no,

04:20.391 --> 04:22.224
and then I'm gonna
wink right after that.

04:24.794 --> 04:26.528
No.

04:29.265 --> 04:31.801
Now, you interpret
that how you see fit.

04:31.802 --> 04:33.436
Oh, my God!

04:33.437 --> 04:37.540
All my boys are watching the
lesbians on the Internet?!

04:37.541 --> 04:39.175
Now, look here, Mama.

04:39.176 --> 04:40.839
I actually don't really
like lesbian porn.

04:40.840 --> 04:42.111
It's just too many toys.

04:42.112 --> 04:44.681
I don't think lesbians
should be able to use toys.

04:44.682 --> 04:46.982
Look, you made a choice, stick with it!

04:51.488 --> 04:55.859
Is my entire family addicted to porn?!

04:55.860 --> 04:58.328
I don't think anyone here
is actually addicted to porn.

04:58.329 --> 05:00.730
And I think watching it in
moderation is a healthy way

05:00.731 --> 05:02.999
for people to explore
their own sexuality.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.635
You always have an opinion!

05:05.636 --> 05:06.970
Hey, Ma, look.

05:06.971 --> 05:08.972
No one in the family
is addicted to porn.

05:08.973 --> 05:11.134
In fact, I don't think the
reverend's addicted to porn.

05:11.135 --> 05:12.958
He just lives in this
environment where people

05:12.959 --> 05:15.178
judge him and make him
feel guilty for watching.

05:15.179 --> 05:16.212
JOE: Yeah, honey.

05:16.213 --> 05:19.282
Porn is not a-a real addiction.

05:19.283 --> 05:21.184
I mean, it's-it's...
sexuality is natural.

05:21.185 --> 05:23.152
It's a basic need.

05:23.153 --> 05:24.387
Next thing you're gonna say

05:24.388 --> 05:27.422
is people can get
addicted to air or food.

05:30.727 --> 05:33.263
Uh, actually, Joe,
people can be addicted to food.

05:33.264 --> 05:36.266
People go to programs
for overeating all the time.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.501
Overeating?

05:38.502 --> 05:40.837
There's no such thing as overeating.

05:40.838 --> 05:43.038
You eat till your hand gets tired.

05:45.742 --> 05:47.777
That is <i>not</i> when you're
supposed to stop eating.

05:47.778 --> 05:49.746
I mean, you can watch
as much porn as you want,

05:49.747 --> 05:51.180
but you need to eat better.

05:51.181 --> 05:54.150
Well, if you are telling me
that I can't eat a cheeseburger

05:54.151 --> 05:56.519
while watching two lesbians
make sweet love to each other

05:56.520 --> 05:59.454
on the Internet, kill me now.

06:00.857 --> 06:02.458
Ain't nobody want to live in a world

06:02.459 --> 06:06.496
without girl-on-girl
action and ground beef.

06:06.497 --> 06:07.864
No more porn, Joe.

06:07.865 --> 06:12.569
I will not stand for that
disgusting smut in my house!

06:12.570 --> 06:14.103
No! No! No, no.

06:14.104 --> 06:17.473
You may think that porn is harmless,

06:17.474 --> 06:20.276
but let me tell you, I've seen
it destroy too many marriages.

06:20.277 --> 06:21.511
Tammy's marriage, Denise's marriage...

06:21.512 --> 06:22.512
BOBBY: Whoa, whoa, wait.

06:22.513 --> 06:23.834
I thought Denise's marriage ended

06:23.835 --> 06:25.138
because her husband was abusive.

06:25.139 --> 06:26.583
No, her first husband was abusive.

06:26.584 --> 06:29.085
Her second husband was on that porn!

06:29.086 --> 06:31.421
(sighs) Look, y'all,

06:31.422 --> 06:32.455
Mom's right, okay?

06:32.456 --> 06:34.557
I mean, porn can mess you up.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.225
You know, I-I saw
professionals having sex

06:36.226 --> 06:38.161
before I even did it myself.

06:38.162 --> 06:41.598
And, I mean, it creates these
unrealistic expectations.

06:41.599 --> 06:44.634
How do they not take a water break?

06:44.635 --> 06:46.603
Well, Bobby is right.

06:46.604 --> 06:49.339
I mean, our generation
starts watching porn early.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.076
I saw my first porn before
I saw <i>The Lion King.</i>

06:53.077 --> 06:55.345
Well, that's why I never gave
Jerrod and Bobby the talk.

06:55.346 --> 06:57.146
I figure they gonna watch porn anyway,

06:57.147 --> 06:59.048
and a picture's worth a thousand words,

06:59.049 --> 07:01.517
and videos have thousands of images,

07:01.518 --> 07:03.686
so they got a very thorough sex talk.

07:03.687 --> 07:04.954
And thanks to the Internet,

07:04.955 --> 07:07.622
I didn't have to
participate in any of it.

07:08.992 --> 07:12.161
God, I wish my mom had left me
to figure it out on my own.

07:12.162 --> 07:14.530
She just had a couple martinis,
sat me down and said,

07:14.531 --> 07:16.099
"Sex is power."

07:16.100 --> 07:17.799
I was eight.

07:19.135 --> 07:21.970
All of you have lost your way.

07:23.072 --> 07:25.108
I'm gonna shut down that Internet.

07:25.109 --> 07:27.710
I'm gonna find us a
new place to worship.

07:27.711 --> 07:30.880
Because you all need church right now.

07:30.881 --> 07:34.117
'Cause you're nasty.

07:34.118 --> 07:37.020
You're just nasty!

07:37.021 --> 07:39.722
Uh, Cynthia, don't go searching
the history on our computer.

07:39.723 --> 07:41.991
I came clean. I told you everything.

07:41.992 --> 07:43.760
You think your mama
knows what a MILF is?

07:43.761 --> 07:45.561
- I...
- Cynthia?

07:45.562 --> 07:48.531
Cynthia, MILFs are the same age as us,

07:48.532 --> 07:50.298
so that's not nasty.

07:53.136 --> 07:54.671
(sighs): Oh.

07:54.672 --> 07:55.872
Church for the first time,

07:55.873 --> 07:57.507
talking about porn with your family.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.742
Not a bad Sunday, huh?

07:59.743 --> 08:02.545
Well, let's do neither of
those things again for a while.

08:02.546 --> 08:04.547
All right, Maxine, Netflix Sunday.

08:04.548 --> 08:05.848
Let's, uh, put on our sweats

08:05.849 --> 08:08.217
and watch <i>Friends</i>
<i>until we see a black person.</i>

08:08.218 --> 08:10.987
(chuckles)

08:10.988 --> 08:13.122
Last time, we got through
an entire season.

08:13.123 --> 08:17.126
You know, porn has such
a stigma attached to it

08:17.127 --> 08:19.996
because people in our country
are so uptight about sex.

08:19.997 --> 08:21.130
Mm-hmm.

08:21.131 --> 08:22.899
We should be able to talk about it.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.233
Mm-hmm.

08:24.234 --> 08:26.735
Let's talk about it.

08:27.603 --> 08:29.338
No.

08:29.339 --> 08:31.240
Come on, what kind
of porn do you watch?

08:31.241 --> 08:34.110
Maxine, why do you insist
on asking questions

08:34.111 --> 08:36.712
that will destroy us?

08:36.714 --> 08:38.280
Come on, this is ridiculous.

08:38.282 --> 08:40.416
We can have sex,
but we can't talk about sex?

08:40.417 --> 08:41.884
Yeah, because talking about sex

08:41.885 --> 08:43.686
is way more intimate than having it.

08:43.687 --> 08:46.889
In fact, people have sex
just to avoid talking about it.

08:46.890 --> 08:49.492
Do you have any fetishes?

08:49.493 --> 08:51.894
I'm not doing this with you, Maxine.

08:51.895 --> 08:53.996
Or, like, a favorite porn star?

08:53.997 --> 08:55.431
(sighs)

08:55.432 --> 08:57.633
Ariana Marie.

08:57.634 --> 08:58.968
Who's that?

08:58.969 --> 09:01.838
Actually, it's a tie
between her and Alexis Texas.

09:01.839 --> 09:03.773
Uh, they're both from Texas.

09:03.774 --> 09:06.042
Actually, Ariana is from
Clearwater, Florida.

09:06.043 --> 09:07.844
She grew up in Texas though.

09:07.845 --> 09:11.013
She's, like, five-four,
dark hair, green eyes.

09:11.014 --> 09:12.115
You know the type.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.282
What, what, do you have

09:13.283 --> 09:14.786
this girl's rookie card or something?

09:14.787 --> 09:16.452
Oh.

09:16.453 --> 09:18.087
Also, I really like Dani Daniels.

09:18.088 --> 09:19.822
She's really funny on Instagram.

09:19.823 --> 09:21.257
Oh, you follow her on Instagram?

09:21.258 --> 09:24.227
Yeah. Oh, honorary mention...
Cassidy Banks...

09:24.228 --> 09:26.229
and Harley Dean.

09:26.230 --> 09:28.865
Okay, how much porn are you watching?

09:28.866 --> 09:31.000
And when are you doing all this?

09:31.001 --> 09:33.870
Well, you know when I text you

09:33.871 --> 09:37.873
and I ask you, like, what time
are you coming home exactly?

09:40.943 --> 09:43.279
You send me those texts a lot.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.414
Yeah, because I'm a man, Maxine.

09:45.415 --> 09:46.949
I can't be pent up.

09:46.950 --> 09:49.085
You know what happens
when a man is pent up?

09:49.086 --> 09:50.585
People get killed.

09:52.021 --> 09:54.004
Like, the last mass shooting
could've been avoided

09:54.005 --> 09:56.692
by a visit to Pornhub.com.

09:56.693 --> 10:00.897
Well, Jerrod, women have just
as much need and desire as men.

10:00.898 --> 10:04.033
This might surprise you to
hear, but I watch porn, too.

10:04.034 --> 10:06.769
You watch porn?

10:06.770 --> 10:08.771
What type of porn are you watching?

10:08.772 --> 10:10.973
I search for more amateur stuff.

10:10.974 --> 10:12.975
I like it when they're,
like, real-life couples.

10:12.976 --> 10:15.378
'Cause I think an
honest human connection

10:15.379 --> 10:18.714
is a... huge turn-on.

10:18.715 --> 10:21.317
Maxine, that's disgusting.

10:21.318 --> 10:24.086
I mean, what I watch is fantasy.

10:24.087 --> 10:25.421
You're being a creepy third wheel

10:25.422 --> 10:27.690
in someone else's relationship.

10:27.691 --> 10:30.092
Okay, I thought we were having
an open, honest conversation

10:30.093 --> 10:31.494
without judgment.

10:31.495 --> 10:32.628
Who promised no judgment?

10:32.629 --> 10:33.812
I didn't promise no judgment.

10:33.813 --> 10:35.364
I am judging you right now.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.166
When are you finding all the time

10:37.167 --> 10:39.268
to watch these real
people have sex anyway?

10:39.269 --> 10:41.971
I don't know, like, last night.

10:41.972 --> 10:43.272
Last night?

10:43.273 --> 10:44.907
Uh, I was here last night.

10:44.908 --> 10:46.509
Yeah, I know you were home.

10:46.510 --> 10:50.079
I just... I drew myself a
bath, had a little me time.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.513
You were asleep.

10:53.382 --> 10:55.184
Well, why didn't you wake me up?

10:55.185 --> 10:57.787
Think I could've helped you
out with that, Maxine.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.149
Uh, you wake me up for everything.

10:59.150 --> 11:00.493
You woke me up 'cause you thought

11:00.494 --> 11:02.758
you solved <i>Making a Murderer.</i>

11:02.759 --> 11:04.060
Are you really uncomfortable

11:04.061 --> 11:05.761
with the idea of me watching porn?

11:05.762 --> 11:06.996
No, I'm not uncomfortable.

11:06.997 --> 11:08.965
I'm just worried about you having

11:08.966 --> 11:12.201
all these products near the bathtub.

11:12.202 --> 11:14.570
It voids the AppleCare.

11:14.571 --> 11:16.672
So you're just gonna take
all my Apple products?

11:16.673 --> 11:19.874
Steve Jobs didn't die for this!

11:26.008 --> 11:29.588
Dad, you're in here drinking whiskey?

11:29.589 --> 11:33.158
Well, your mama's mad
at me, so here we are.

11:33.159 --> 11:35.126
There are other ways to relieve stress,

11:35.127 --> 11:37.194
but your mama's holding
the computer hostage.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.432
She's really mad, huh?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.901
What happened after I left?

11:42.902 --> 11:45.003
She screamed, "You're
not the man I married,"

11:45.004 --> 11:48.239
and slammed the door to our
room and hasn't come out since.

11:48.240 --> 11:51.176
Your brother's, uh, sulking
because your mama's mad

11:51.177 --> 11:53.111
and nobody wants to go
to Red Robin with him.

11:53.112 --> 11:56.715
So it has been... a
rough day for everyone.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.316
- Yeah.
- (clears throat)

11:58.317 --> 12:00.385
Uh, kind of want to talk
to you about something

12:00.386 --> 12:02.887
between me and Maxine,
but I got to be honest,

12:02.888 --> 12:06.124
it's a little awkward to bring up.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.060
Jerrod, I gave you a
Diane Sawyer amount

12:09.061 --> 12:11.563
of access to my life today.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.198
Okay.

12:13.199 --> 12:16.234
Maxine told me that she watches porn.

12:16.235 --> 12:19.704
Well, a lot of your modern
women are into that now.

12:19.705 --> 12:22.941
Your Lena Dunhams,
your Rashida Joneses,

12:22.942 --> 12:25.877
that girl that works at the Rite Aid.

12:25.878 --> 12:28.146
No, but she doesn't just watch it.

12:28.147 --> 12:31.082
She, like, sneaks off and
does it while I'm still at home.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.685
You telling me that Maxine watches porn

12:33.686 --> 12:36.588
while her able-bodied boyfriend
is available in the next room?

12:36.589 --> 12:38.021
Yes.

12:42.761 --> 12:45.063
Thank you.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.966
Now, clearly you need sex advice.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.601
Now, you came to the right place.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.505
You see, son, good sex is
all about the calf muscles.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.140
Nope. Nope.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.742
I am not here for sex advice.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.044
I'm just concerned.

12:59.045 --> 13:02.280
I mean, Maxine and I
are going on two years,

13:02.281 --> 13:04.215
and I'm worried that this is a sign

13:04.216 --> 13:06.818
that maybe the passion is
fading in our relationship.

13:06.819 --> 13:08.787
Well, in my 34 years of marriage,

13:08.788 --> 13:12.057
I've had plenty of worries and fears.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.792
Am I good enough?

13:13.793 --> 13:15.727
Am I making her happy?

13:15.728 --> 13:19.164
Is ten minutes too long or too short?

13:19.165 --> 13:23.068
So worrying about the
passion fading is normal.

13:23.069 --> 13:24.669
Not for you.

13:24.670 --> 13:26.638
Y'all ain't even been
together barely two years.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.240
You should still be in
the honeymoon phase.

13:29.241 --> 13:31.910
This is a disaster.

13:31.911 --> 13:35.480
You know, you may want to
consider the possibility

13:35.481 --> 13:37.415
that you just bad at sex.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.050
Oh, no. No, no, no, Dad.

13:39.051 --> 13:40.685
I'm not bad at sex.

13:40.686 --> 13:41.986
Well, let me see your calves.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.189
No, no, don't...

13:44.190 --> 13:45.490
Are you serious right now?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.960
Do you really think that
maybe Maxine isn't satisfied?

13:48.961 --> 13:52.230
Jerrod, if your mama makes me dinner

13:52.231 --> 13:54.499
and I sneak out the house
for a cheeseburger,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.402
I'm unhappy with my dinner.

13:57.403 --> 14:00.771
Maxine is unhappy with
her dinner, <i>capisce?</i>

14:02.640 --> 14:03.975
(sighs) Yeah.

14:03.976 --> 14:05.276
Uh, and take this with you.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.579
I think you need it more than I do.

14:07.580 --> 14:08.580
Thank you.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.980
(clears throat)

14:11.149 --> 14:12.784
- And Jerrod.
- Yeah?

14:12.785 --> 14:14.085
Two short, one deep.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.153
I am not having this talk with you.

14:18.356 --> 14:22.927
Just to be clear, if I turn on
the parental control setting,

14:22.928 --> 14:26.930
I can block the lesbians
and still stream <i>Ellen?</i>

14:29.701 --> 14:30.835
Well, thank you.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.303
No, you've been incredibly helpful.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.572
(clears throat)

14:34.573 --> 14:36.875
(knocking on door)

14:36.876 --> 14:38.510
Mom, I need to talk to you.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.478
I'm not going to Red Robin.

14:40.479 --> 14:44.616
It's new, but it's a chain,
and they're all the same, Bobby.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.584
No, that's not it,
even though I will argue

14:46.585 --> 14:49.521
that each Red Robin got
their own distinct personality.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.456
(sighs) I just think you overreacted

14:51.457 --> 14:53.491
how angry you are
with us and the reverend.

14:53.492 --> 14:55.774
I don't want you to leave the
church; you love that place.

14:55.775 --> 14:57.278
It's been your second home for years.

14:57.279 --> 14:58.496
But I don't think

14:58.497 --> 15:02.367
you in a place to be,
um, so judgmental.

15:02.368 --> 15:04.636
Well, now, what is
that supposed to mean?

15:04.637 --> 15:06.237
(sighs)

15:06.238 --> 15:08.338
I got something to tell you.

15:10.141 --> 15:12.210
Ooh, okay, I hoped
this day would never come.

15:12.211 --> 15:14.145
What day?

15:14.146 --> 15:16.114
What are you talking about?

15:16.115 --> 15:20.018
All right, when I was 13, I came
up here looking for my VHS

15:20.019 --> 15:21.642
of all my favorite
Fresh Prince episodes.

15:21.643 --> 15:22.120
Uh-huh.

15:22.121 --> 15:24.422
You know, I wanted to watch
the one where Will got shot

15:24.423 --> 15:26.566
and-and Carlton got nervous
and ended up buying a gun.

15:26.567 --> 15:27.825
Well, what happened?

15:27.826 --> 15:29.427
Well, in a very emotional moment,

15:29.428 --> 15:30.728
when they got to the hospital,

15:30.729 --> 15:32.363
Will took the gun from Carlton, right?

15:32.364 --> 15:34.685
And listen, every time I think
about this, it makes me cry.

15:34.686 --> 15:36.749
He just, "Give me the gun,
Carlton! I saved your..."

15:36.750 --> 15:38.431
Bobby, Bobby!

15:43.074 --> 15:46.511
What happened in the story
you were telling me about?

15:46.512 --> 15:47.779
(sighs) All right.

15:47.780 --> 15:50.882
Uh, so I put the VHS in,

15:50.883 --> 15:54.152
expecting to see a
<i>Fresh Prince</i> episode,

15:54.153 --> 15:57.555
but it wasn't a <i>Fresh Prince</i> episode.

15:57.556 --> 16:00.123
It was, uh, you and Daddy...

16:03.695 --> 16:04.996
...in a sex tape.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.596
Oh!

16:09.234 --> 16:10.535
What?!

16:10.536 --> 16:13.605
Oh, I-I... I told Joe to get rid of it.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.074
Well, oh, God, I really
wish he would have.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.509
Those few seconds really messed me up.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.613
I haven't been able to watch
<i>Fresh Prince</i> for 20 years.

16:21.614 --> 16:24.415
Matter of fact, I can't see
anything that Will Smith was in.

16:24.416 --> 16:28.019
Do you know how bad I
wanted to see <i>Hancock?</i>

16:28.020 --> 16:31.456
Bobby, you shouldn't have seen that.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.091
I'm sorry.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.360
I don't want you to
think any less of me.

16:35.361 --> 16:37.495
It was just, your daddy,

16:37.496 --> 16:39.977
- you know, he was trying to...
- Okay, wait. Nope, nope, stop.

16:39.978 --> 16:42.841
- He had this thing with his calf muscle...
- Please, don't! Stop, stop!

16:42.842 --> 16:44.902
Mama, you don't have
to tell me anything, okay?

16:44.903 --> 16:47.126
(sighs) Look, I don't think
less of you because of this.

16:47.127 --> 16:48.139
It's your private life.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.108
But you shouldn't think
less of us either.

16:50.109 --> 16:53.477
It just feels so good to judge people.

17:01.386 --> 17:05.623
Until you get called on
it, you know what I mean?

17:05.624 --> 17:08.226
Look here, Ma, look, you have
nothing to worry about, okay?

17:08.227 --> 17:10.694
There's still plenty of
people you can judge.

17:10.695 --> 17:14.732
Matter of fact, your friend
Denise is back in rehab.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.034
Oh. (chuckles)

17:16.035 --> 17:19.102
Bobby, you always know
the right thing to say.

17:20.905 --> 17:23.174
Ah, come on, let's go to Red Robin.

17:23.175 --> 17:24.273
(laughs)

17:25.609 --> 17:27.111
I need some gas money, too, Ma.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.845
Oh...

17:30.715 --> 17:33.484
Maxine, am I bad at sex?

17:33.485 --> 17:36.321
Um, first of all, close the door.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.590
And secondly,
why are you asking me that?

17:39.591 --> 17:40.892
Because I want to know.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.827
I mean, you're in the
bathroom watching porn.

17:42.828 --> 17:44.896
You're not calling
Big J in that moment.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.865
Not gonna lie, Big J's ego
is hurt a little bit.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.500
I'm sorry I said anything.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.884
I should have never pushed us
into having this conversation.

17:51.885 --> 17:53.771
Yeah, but, like, why
are you watching it

17:53.772 --> 17:56.240
while I'm sitting there
in the next room?

17:56.241 --> 17:57.542
(sighs): Okay.

17:57.543 --> 17:59.677
How do I explain this?

17:59.678 --> 18:02.780
Okay, you know how sometimes you go out

18:02.781 --> 18:05.016
to brunch and mimosas
with friends, and it's great,

18:05.017 --> 18:06.951
but then other times
you just want to come home

18:06.952 --> 18:08.619
and have a glass of Bordeaux alone?

18:08.620 --> 18:10.254
Nah, I grew up poor.

18:10.255 --> 18:12.857
None of that really relates to my life.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.792
Okay, that's a bad example.

18:14.793 --> 18:16.094
Yeah.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.030
Okay, you know how sometimes
you need a workout partner,

18:19.031 --> 18:22.233
and then sometimes you just get
on the treadmill by yourself?

18:22.234 --> 18:24.469
Yeah, I don't really
work out like that.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.738
- I, like, tried...
- Do we have anything in common?

18:26.739 --> 18:28.673
Well, apparently just watching porn.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.508
(sighs)

18:30.509 --> 18:31.943
Jerrod,

18:31.944 --> 18:34.712
why does it have to signal that
something is wrong when I do it,

18:34.713 --> 18:37.014
but you list off the name
of ten porn stars...

18:37.015 --> 18:39.283
and I got to be honest,
it seems a little excessive...

18:39.284 --> 18:42.220
but it's okay?

18:42.221 --> 18:44.489
August Ames.

18:44.490 --> 18:46.758
I'm sorry, I left her
off the list earlier.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.559
Jerrod.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.597
(sighs) Why is it such a big
deal to you that I watch porn?

18:52.598 --> 18:57.335
Well, because women watch porn
because they're not satisfied.

18:57.336 --> 19:00.638
Men watch it because we're monsters.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.573
But that is just not true.

19:02.574 --> 19:05.042
It is such a fallacy that
women's sexual appetites

19:05.043 --> 19:06.477
are different than men's.

19:06.478 --> 19:09.013
This is just a classic
instance of society creating

19:09.014 --> 19:10.717
double standards in
order to control women.

19:10.718 --> 19:13.819
Okay, uh, Maxine, please do
not make porn sound boring.

19:14.952 --> 19:16.320
I'm not gonna lie.

19:16.321 --> 19:18.489
I think it's a little
weird that you watch it.

19:18.490 --> 19:20.591
Well, I think it's weird
that you watch it.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.660
I think it's weird
that any of us watch it.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.495
We're watching strangers
having sex on camera.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.764
It's weird. But we do it.

19:26.765 --> 19:30.001
And that doesn't mean that
there's anything wrong with us.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.636
I mean, what do you want to do?

19:31.637 --> 19:34.372
You want to both agree
to not watch it anymore?

19:34.373 --> 19:36.273
No.

19:37.809 --> 19:39.444
Okay. (chuckles)

19:39.445 --> 19:41.379
Uh, well, then how about this?

19:41.380 --> 19:44.949
I... I promise that I
will not watch it anymore

19:44.950 --> 19:45.950
while you are home,

19:45.951 --> 19:49.953
if you unfollow Dani
Daniels on Instagram.

19:52.123 --> 19:53.223
Deal.

19:55.059 --> 19:56.527
(sighs)

19:56.528 --> 19:58.496
But you're missing out on some
really funny posts, Maxine.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.630
Like, she's great...

19:59.631 --> 20:01.232
- Okay.
- Okay, fine, fine, fine.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.201
God, the things I do for love.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.902
(chuckles)

20:04.903 --> 20:07.637
So what time are you
getting home tomorrow?

20:11.676 --> 20:13.777
Exactly?

20:18.373 --> 20:21.641
(both laughing)

20:22.534 --> 20:24.203
We were so young.

20:24.204 --> 20:26.772
I know.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.708
- Oh, Joe, there your move!
- Oh!

20:29.709 --> 20:31.043
That's your move, baby!

20:31.044 --> 20:32.377
(laughs)

20:32.378 --> 20:33.879
I'm glad we got that on film,

20:33.880 --> 20:35.714
'cause I damn sure
can't do that no more.

20:35.715 --> 20:38.383
(laughs)

20:38.384 --> 20:41.720
WILL SMITH: ♪ Now this is
the story all about how... ♪

20:41.721 --> 20:44.389
What happened?

20:44.390 --> 20:46.058
Oh, if Bobby had hung in there,

20:46.059 --> 20:48.460
he could have seen
the rest of his show.

20:48.461 --> 20:50.529
Mm-hmm.

20:50.923 --> 20:58.123
