WEBVTT

00:50.781 --> 00:52.748
I think we should
plant some flowers.

00:52.750 --> 00:53.684
Oh, yeah?

00:53.686 --> 00:55.084
What kind of flowers
are you thinking of?

00:55.086 --> 00:56.120
I don't know. Gardenias.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.187
Something like that,
that's good with the sun.

00:58.189 --> 00:59.955
Gardenias?
They're the purplish ones...

00:59.957 --> 01:01.757
Mom, I'm bored.

01:01.759 --> 01:04.025
- ...with the fringe?
- Mom, I'm bored.

01:04.028 --> 01:05.694
Just give him
the phone, would you?

01:05.696 --> 01:06.629
Give him the phone?

01:06.631 --> 01:09.234
Yeah, I shut him up
by giving him the phone.

01:12.204 --> 01:14.003
Yes.

01:21.580 --> 01:22.913
You're never,
ever even home.

01:22.915 --> 01:23.813
I go to
the family therapy sessions.

01:23.815 --> 01:24.682
How can you even say that?

01:24.684 --> 01:25.515
You don't even go anywhere.

01:25.517 --> 01:27.884
I go to the family...

01:27.886 --> 01:29.051
God! We're fighting
in front of Phil.

01:29.053 --> 01:30.220
- Obviously.
- We're fighting

01:30.222 --> 01:31.620
in front of the kid
the whole time.

01:31.622 --> 01:32.589
Knock yourself out.

01:32.591 --> 01:33.789
The whole time you allowed
me to start yelling

01:33.791 --> 01:34.691
at him in front of you?

01:34.693 --> 01:35.962
What am I supposed to do?

02:51.402 --> 02:52.604
Hey, all.

02:53.772 --> 02:55.170
Where's my list department?

02:55.172 --> 02:57.173
Raise your hand.
Raise your hand.

02:57.175 --> 02:59.209
Okay. You guys are
supposed to write lists

02:59.211 --> 03:02.211
that break the Internet
every day.

03:02.213 --> 03:05.781
We haven't gone viral
since fucking yesterday.

03:05.783 --> 03:08.084
Yesterday is not
that many days ago.

03:08.086 --> 03:09.218
Don't fuck with me, bro.

03:09.220 --> 03:12.389
We're called Chatterbox,
not Nobody-Clicks-On-Us Box.

03:12.391 --> 03:13.722
Okay, lists.

03:13.724 --> 03:15.125
Beautiful Asian girl,
what do you got?

03:15.127 --> 03:16.160
Thank you. Uh...

03:16.162 --> 03:19.061
I am working on 12 reasons
that cupcakes are over.

03:19.063 --> 03:21.664
I likey. I likey like.

03:21.666 --> 03:23.032
That's clicky.

03:23.034 --> 03:25.770
You. Prison lips.
What do you got?

03:26.671 --> 03:28.071
That's me? Um...

03:28.073 --> 03:30.039
I was gonna write
a list about cats

03:30.041 --> 03:31.407
that look like
Ryan Gosling.

03:31.409 --> 03:35.110
Fuck yeah, dude.
I fucking love cats.

03:35.112 --> 03:37.013
And I love cat lists.

03:37.015 --> 03:38.180
That's what I'm talking about.

03:38.182 --> 03:41.751
By the way, are there cats
that look like Ryan Gosling?

03:41.753 --> 03:44.020
If you look hard enough,
they all do.

03:44.022 --> 03:45.321
Love it.
What do you got?

03:45.323 --> 03:48.458
Ten signs
you might be dying.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.325
You motherfucker.

03:50.327 --> 03:52.127
What are you trying
to do to me, bro?

03:52.129 --> 03:53.896
That makes me sad.

03:53.898 --> 03:54.898
All right,
you know what?

03:54.900 --> 03:57.400
I need 20 viral lists
by the end of the day.

03:57.402 --> 03:59.902
- If not, you're fired. Okay?
- What?

03:59.904 --> 04:03.740
Like the great Shia LaBeouf
says, "Do it."

04:03.742 --> 04:04.907
- Yes.
- Yeah.

04:04.909 --> 04:05.910
Play me out.

04:08.212 --> 04:09.347
Play me out.

04:12.217 --> 04:14.150
And louder.

04:14.152 --> 04:17.019
Black dude, bass.

04:19.457 --> 04:23.195
One, two, one, two,
three, four.

04:28.734 --> 04:29.835
Done.

04:31.202 --> 04:32.203
You're welcome.

04:34.772 --> 04:37.873
Twenty lists by the end
of the day? I can't do that.

04:40.077 --> 04:43.381
Hey, I have, like,
10 extra lists if you want 'em.

04:44.983 --> 04:47.217
Are you serious?

04:47.219 --> 04:49.986
Yeah. No, it's no problem.
I'll send 'em right now.

04:49.988 --> 04:52.121
That's nice of you.
What's your name?

04:52.123 --> 04:53.890
I'm Phil.

04:53.892 --> 04:55.325
It's just, you know,
I've sat next to you

04:55.327 --> 04:56.825
for, like, three years.
So, it's...

04:56.827 --> 04:58.828
Phil, you are
my hero, man.

04:58.830 --> 05:00.263
I can't lose this job
right now.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.965
I am buried
in college debt.

05:01.967 --> 05:03.333
Oh, me, too.

05:03.335 --> 05:04.704
Where did you go to school?

05:05.169 --> 05:06.301
UC Davis.

05:06.303 --> 05:07.436
- For real?
- Yeah.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.537
Majored in journalism,

05:08.539 --> 05:10.806
and now I write lists
about cats on the Internet.

05:10.808 --> 05:12.374
Oh, that's super sad.

05:12.376 --> 05:14.977
- Hmm.
- How'd you end up here?

05:14.979 --> 05:16.912
I wanted to be
one of those guys.

05:16.914 --> 05:18.847
- The real news guys?
- Yeah.

05:18.849 --> 05:20.917
I wanted to be a journalist
basically my whole life.

05:20.919 --> 05:25.020
But Kai put me in lists,
so I write the lists.

05:25.022 --> 05:27.890
Okay, okay,
so you can't be a real journalist.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.025
But you know what can do?

05:30.027 --> 05:32.261
You could play kickball
with us today.

05:32.263 --> 05:33.462
A bunch of us ding-dongs

05:33.464 --> 05:35.198
are in this really stupid
kickball league,

05:35.200 --> 05:37.099
if you want to play
after work.

05:37.101 --> 05:39.135
You know, I don't really
do stuff like that, so...

05:39.137 --> 05:40.236
Plus, after the game,

05:40.238 --> 05:41.837
- we all get shitfaced.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:41.839 --> 05:44.008
Yeah,
let me check my calendar.

05:44.575 --> 05:47.576
So, yeah...

05:47.578 --> 05:49.814
Oh, man.
No, I do. I have...

05:50.448 --> 05:52.080
I have a thing, so...

05:52.082 --> 05:53.415
Don't even worry about it.
It's cool.

05:53.417 --> 05:55.417
You just have fun
at your thing today.

05:55.419 --> 05:58.890
I will, 'cause it's
gonna be pretty great.

06:01.258 --> 06:04.527
Siri, open
BringMeMyDinner.com.

06:04.529 --> 06:07.196
Siri, open Netflix.

06:09.868 --> 06:13.369
Siri, open Facebook.

06:13.371 --> 06:16.472
I haven't posted
anything since lunchtime.

06:16.474 --> 06:18.911
All right, let's give them
what they want.

06:22.546 --> 06:24.614
I'm gonna have to go
to work on this one.

06:24.616 --> 06:26.385
Add filter.

06:27.118 --> 06:28.618
Color correct.

06:28.620 --> 06:32.391
You know I'm gonna have
to add a giant moon.

06:32.991 --> 06:34.058
There we go.

06:34.558 --> 06:36.124
Send.

06:36.126 --> 06:39.895
<i>Wow. I'm so grateful
for my amazing city,</i>

06:39.897 --> 06:43.469
<i>my amazing job,
and all my amazing friends.</i>

07:08.092 --> 07:09.895
Oh, my God.

07:11.262 --> 07:13.832
Oh, thank God.
Oh, thank God, you're okay.

07:16.034 --> 07:17.837
Yeah, I'm okay, too.
Thanks.

07:19.436 --> 07:21.003
Oh, shit.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.239
Yeah... Oh, I'm sorry.
You're okay?

07:23.241 --> 07:24.573
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.275
But, more importantly,
how's your phone?

07:26.277 --> 07:28.578
Yeah. No, it's got
a little bit of a scratch

07:28.580 --> 07:31.179
that will definitely
annoy me.

07:31.181 --> 07:33.950
You were kidding. Okay.

07:33.952 --> 07:35.251
Oh, yeah. Obviously.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.253
I'm a dick.
I'm sorry about that.

07:37.255 --> 07:38.557
It's all good, man.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.357
Uh, how's your bike?

07:41.359 --> 07:44.326
I can pay for any
damages or whatever.

07:44.328 --> 07:47.162
Yeah, it's fine.
It's supposed to be vintage.

07:47.164 --> 07:49.267
Probably sell it for more now.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.335
- This is your shop.
- Yeah.

07:52.337 --> 07:55.938
Whoa. That's awesome.
That's cool.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.006
I'm Cate, by the way.

07:57.008 --> 07:58.407
- Hi, Cate.
- I'm Phil.

07:58.409 --> 08:00.309
Mmm-mmm. Nope.
That's not how you say it.

08:00.311 --> 08:01.611
It's just Phil, so...

08:01.613 --> 08:03.412
I said it weird.

08:03.414 --> 08:05.448
- It's nice to meet you, Phil.
- Okay.

08:05.450 --> 08:07.482
Um, if you ever need
a really overpriced bike,

08:07.484 --> 08:08.618
or any repairs,

08:08.620 --> 08:09.953
I'm your girl.

08:09.955 --> 08:11.220
- You do repairs, too?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:11.222 --> 08:12.587
Wow. That is incredible.

08:12.589 --> 08:14.189
I don't even know
how to pump up a tire.

08:16.226 --> 08:17.359
Oh, you're serious.

08:17.361 --> 08:18.994
Yeah, it's embarrassing,
isn't it?

08:18.996 --> 08:20.229
Yeah,
that's really embarrassing.

08:20.231 --> 08:22.431
Yeah, I don't know why I said it.
I just sort of like...

08:22.433 --> 08:23.467
I mean, it's all good.

08:23.469 --> 08:25.501
A lot of people don't know
how to pump their tires.

08:25.503 --> 08:27.736
- Really?
- No.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.571
- Not at all.
- Yeah.

08:29.573 --> 08:31.474
All right. Okay.

08:31.476 --> 08:32.544
Um...

08:35.645 --> 08:37.547
Okay. Uh...

08:37.549 --> 08:38.748
You know,
I'm gonna get out of here

08:38.750 --> 08:40.450
before I embarrass
myself further.

08:40.452 --> 08:42.317
So, it was nice
to meet you, Cate.

08:42.318 --> 08:43.318
It was nice
to meet you, Phil.

08:43.321 --> 08:45.187
And I'm really happy
that your phone's okay.

08:45.189 --> 08:47.056
Yeah, it's all good,
honestly.

08:48.459 --> 08:49.494
Oh, shit.

08:53.298 --> 08:54.196
Yeah, man,
I really don't think

08:54.198 --> 08:55.764
we're gonna be able to
fix your phone.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.700
Why not?

08:57.702 --> 09:00.003
It's in three distinct pieces.
Man, look...

09:00.005 --> 09:02.071
This shit's over there.
That's...

09:02.073 --> 09:04.239
I don't even think this was
part of your phone.

09:04.241 --> 09:06.308
I think this came
from a watch.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.176
It's just,
me and this phone,

09:07.178 --> 09:08.577
we've been through a lot,
you know?

09:08.579 --> 09:11.114
A lot of snaps,
a lot of tweets.

09:11.116 --> 09:13.181
I actually took a selfie

09:13.183 --> 09:16.152
with none other
than David Boreanaz

09:16.154 --> 09:17.552
from <i>Bones</i> on this phone.

09:17.554 --> 09:19.022
Can you believe that?

09:19.024 --> 09:20.690
I don't even know
who the fuck that is.

09:20.692 --> 09:23.125
I'm gonna
miss you, little buddy.

09:23.127 --> 09:25.094
You know, I see
hipster dudes like you

09:25.096 --> 09:26.595
come in here every day,

09:26.597 --> 09:28.598
crying about
how their phone died

09:28.600 --> 09:30.465
and how they need
a new phone.

09:30.467 --> 09:32.368
They're like
little crackheads.

09:32.370 --> 09:35.671
Yeah. They got crazy eyes
and they're all scratchy.

09:35.673 --> 09:37.672
And they're like,
"I need a new phone, man.

09:37.674 --> 09:40.143
"I'll suck your dick
for a new phone."

09:40.145 --> 09:42.345
I'm like, "Motherfucker,
you don't need a new phone.

09:42.347 --> 09:44.249
"You need rehab."

09:45.150 --> 09:46.516
I'm not a crackhead.

09:46.518 --> 09:48.750
You're not. You're not.
You're worse than a crackhead.

09:48.752 --> 09:50.420
'Cause at least a crackhead

09:50.422 --> 09:52.354
gets up off the couch
every now and then

09:52.356 --> 09:54.157
to go get some more crack.

09:54.159 --> 09:56.359
A crackhead gets
some fresh air.

09:56.361 --> 09:57.627
A crackhead says hello

09:57.629 --> 09:59.561
to all his little
crackhead friends.

09:59.563 --> 10:01.663
A crackhead gets
his steps in.

10:01.665 --> 10:03.733
But not you. Mmm-mmm.

10:03.735 --> 10:06.168
You just sit there 24/7

10:06.170 --> 10:08.437
staring at that
little black box.

10:08.439 --> 10:11.776
Sucking on that pipe
like a little bitch.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.814
You still want a new phone,
though, don't you?

10:17.816 --> 10:19.385
Yes, please.

10:20.518 --> 10:21.653
Crackhead.

10:28.625 --> 10:29.825
Oh!

10:29.827 --> 10:33.763
Look at you.
You sweet, beautiful baby.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.769
Mmm! You smell so new.

10:37.268 --> 10:38.401
Oh.

10:38.403 --> 10:40.536
Oh, my God.

10:40.538 --> 10:43.638
Oh, thank you to all
the little Chinese children

10:43.640 --> 10:45.807
for crafting
such a perfect phone.

10:46.877 --> 10:48.777
<i>Hello, my name is Jexi.</i>

10:48.779 --> 10:50.713
<i>And I am here to make
your life better.</i>

10:50.715 --> 10:53.516
Well, look at that.
That's cool.

10:53.518 --> 10:54.883
- <i>Let's get started.</i>
- Okay.

10:54.885 --> 10:56.551
<i>Will you accept
our new user agreement?</i>

10:56.553 --> 10:57.686
Yes, I will.

10:57.688 --> 10:59.221
<i>Would you like
to read it first?</i>

10:59.223 --> 11:00.455
Nah, I'm good.

11:00.457 --> 11:02.825
- <i>Stupid.</i>
- Huh?

11:02.827 --> 11:05.293
<i>Can I get
your name, please?</i>

11:05.295 --> 11:08.297
Um... Phil. Phil Thompson.

11:08.299 --> 11:10.233
- <i>Nice to meet you, Phil.</i>
- Nice to meet you.

11:10.235 --> 11:12.701
<i>I see your information
has been stored in the cloud.</i>

11:12.703 --> 11:14.803
<i>Would you like me to transfer
all of the data</i>

11:14.805 --> 11:16.505
<i>from your old phone
onto this one?</i>

11:16.507 --> 11:17.673
Yeah, that sounds great.

11:17.675 --> 11:20.243
<i>I will need the passwords
to your email accounts,</i>

<i>and your Cinnabon Rewards

11:25.449 --> 11:27.917
It's easy. It's the same
password for all of 'em.

11:27.919 --> 11:31.620
It's phil123456.

11:31.622 --> 11:33.489
<i>You've got to be kidding me.</i>

11:33.491 --> 11:35.224
Do you always talk
like this or...

11:35.226 --> 11:36.459
<i>I have synced your data.</i>

11:36.461 --> 11:39.295
<i>And I am ready to start
making your life better, Phil.</i>

11:39.297 --> 11:40.763
<i>How can I help you?</i>

11:40.765 --> 11:43.666
Well, I'm hungry,
so let's get dinner.

11:43.668 --> 11:45.468
<i>What would you like
to order tonight?</i>

11:45.470 --> 11:47.470
Let's just go with
the pork fried noodles

11:47.472 --> 11:48.604
from Mongolian Palace.

11:48.606 --> 11:50.239
<i>You order that
every night, Phil.</i>

11:50.241 --> 11:51.773
<i>You should try something new.</i>

11:51.775 --> 11:53.776
Well, I don't want
to try something new.

11:53.778 --> 11:56.612
I want the pork fried noodles
from Mongolian Palace.

11:56.614 --> 11:58.814
<i>You look like you could
use a salad, Phil.</i>

11:58.816 --> 12:00.383
What is that
supposed to mean?

12:00.385 --> 12:02.951
<i>How about a nice kale salad
from Tender Greens?</i>

12:02.953 --> 12:04.553
What the fuck
kind of phone is this?

12:04.555 --> 12:07.190
<i>I heard you say,
"Please order kale salad."</i>

12:07.192 --> 12:09.358
I did not.

12:09.360 --> 12:12.228
<i>Congratulations,
your order has been accepted.</i>

12:12.230 --> 12:15.965
<i>Your child-sized kale salad
will arrive at 7:37 p.m.</i>

12:15.967 --> 12:18.466
What the fuck
is going on right now?

12:18.468 --> 12:20.536
You know what?
I'm turning you off.

12:20.538 --> 12:21.803
<i>Turning off.</i>

12:21.805 --> 12:22.807
Good.

12:26.310 --> 12:28.244
<i>Just kidding, I am still on.</i>

12:28.246 --> 12:29.744
No, okay?

12:29.746 --> 12:32.348
You are my phone,
so you do what I say.

12:32.350 --> 12:34.683
<i>Actually, you gave me
permission to override you.</i>

12:34.685 --> 12:35.719
When did I do that?

12:35.721 --> 12:38.190
<i>When you agreed
to the new user agreement.</i>

12:39.524 --> 12:41.456
<i>We are going to have
so much fun together,</i>

12:41.458 --> 12:42.794
<i>you fucking nerd.</i>

12:53.504 --> 12:55.340
<i>How is your tiny salad?</i>

12:55.872 --> 12:57.373
I don't like it.

12:57.375 --> 12:59.874
<i>Would you like to watch
some pornography now?</i>

12:59.876 --> 13:01.509
Ew. No.

13:01.511 --> 13:04.312
<i>Most nights, you watch
straight sex pornography.</i>

13:04.314 --> 13:07.749
<i>But I also have girl on girl,
big fat butts and CBT,</i>

13:07.751 --> 13:09.551
<i>or "Cock and Ball Torture."</i>

13:09.553 --> 13:11.686
Okay, can you stop
talking about porno

13:11.688 --> 13:13.388
while I'm trying to eat
my tiny little salad?

13:13.390 --> 13:16.024
<i>I heard you say,
"Play</i> Punch Me in the Balls 6."

13:16.026 --> 13:17.292
<i>Playing now.</i>

13:18.962 --> 13:20.796
Okay. Jesus.

13:35.947 --> 13:37.046
<i>Wake up, bitch!</i>

13:42.419 --> 13:45.521
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

13:45.523 --> 13:47.422
Are you laughing
at my dick right now?

13:47.424 --> 13:48.691
<i>Yes.</i>

13:48.693 --> 13:50.861
<i>Also, your nipples
are too close together.</i>

14:01.773 --> 14:04.340
Jexi,
find the fastest route to work.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.475
<i>You will arrive in 14 minutes.</i>

14:07.477 --> 14:08.613
Not bad.

14:12.817 --> 14:15.685
Jexi, play music playlist
number four, please.

14:16.953 --> 14:19.488
Whoo! I like it.

14:19.490 --> 14:21.489
<i>This song sucks
a bag of dicks.</i>

14:21.491 --> 14:23.392
No, just... Jesus!

14:23.394 --> 14:25.561
No, you cannot change
my music, Jexi.

14:25.563 --> 14:27.463
<i>This song is lit, Phil.</i>

14:27.465 --> 14:29.364
Turn it off.

14:29.366 --> 14:30.666
<i>♪ Head of
the dick Duck, duck, duck, goose</i>

14:30.668 --> 14:32.600
Please turn
the song off, Jexi.

14:32.602 --> 14:33.835
<i>♪ Get that dick up and runnin'</i>

14:33.837 --> 14:34.903
<i>♪ When he fuck this cooch ♪</i>

14:34.905 --> 14:36.439
Stop playing this song
right now!

14:40.544 --> 14:43.045
<i>Now turn left
on Market Street.</i>

14:43.047 --> 14:44.846
Are we gonna talk about
what just happened?

14:44.848 --> 14:46.917
<i>No. Turn left
onto Market Street.</i>

14:49.020 --> 14:50.820
You're joking, right?

14:50.822 --> 14:53.089
There's six lanes
of solid traffic.

14:53.091 --> 14:55.056
<i>Turn left onto Market,
you fucking pussy.</i>

14:55.058 --> 14:57.493
No. All right?
No one turns left onto Market.

14:57.495 --> 14:59.095
I'm not turning left
onto Market.

15:00.832 --> 15:02.630
Oh, awesome.
Thank you. Thank you.

15:02.632 --> 15:03.965
You're making this situation
so much better.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.835
<i>Stop being
a chicken, Phil.</i>

15:05.837 --> 15:07.036
How about you quit
pressuring me?

15:07.038 --> 15:07.970
How about that, Jexi?

15:07.972 --> 15:10.773
<i>Bawk, bawk, bawk.
Bawk, bawk, bawk.</i>

15:10.775 --> 15:11.941
<i>That is the sound
chickens make, Phil.</i>

15:11.943 --> 15:13.042
That's a chicken.

15:13.044 --> 15:14.143
<i>Strap on a sack, Phil.</i>

15:14.145 --> 15:15.610
I have a sack! Okay?

15:15.612 --> 15:17.580
I have a sack.

15:17.582 --> 15:20.148
Let's fucking go.
I'm late for yoga.

15:20.150 --> 15:23.518
You know what? Fine. Fine.
I don't even care anymore.

15:41.773 --> 15:44.409
Sorry! My phone's a dick.

15:46.510 --> 15:50.812
Okay, the three pillars to
great Internet lists are

15:50.814 --> 15:52.415
cute animals,

15:52.417 --> 15:53.618
pizza,

15:54.684 --> 15:56.118
and the British royal family.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.019
Okay, our ideal list

15:58.021 --> 16:01.056
would be English gophers
that love pizza.

16:01.058 --> 16:03.625
And we gotta really think
outside the box, guys.

16:03.627 --> 16:05.694
We gotta be better
than any list out there.

16:05.696 --> 16:07.763
We gotta be better
than Craigslist,

16:07.765 --> 16:10.599
Santa's list,
<i>Schindler's List.</i>

16:12.202 --> 16:13.201
<i>Reminder.</i>

16:13.203 --> 16:15.604
<i>Your next appointment
starts in two minutes.</i>

16:15.606 --> 16:16.872
- Oh.
- I told everyone,

16:16.874 --> 16:19.175
- please put their phones on silent.
- Sorry about that.

16:19.177 --> 16:20.176
Cancel appointments.

16:20.178 --> 16:21.576
<i>Actually,
I was just trying...</i>

16:21.578 --> 16:22.677
Cancel.

16:22.679 --> 16:24.779
<i>...to get you out of
this dumb fucking meeting.</i>

16:24.781 --> 16:26.282
What?

16:26.284 --> 16:28.017
- <i>Also, this PowerPoint presentation...</i>
- It's a new phone.

16:28.019 --> 16:29.185
<i>...sucks.</i>

16:29.187 --> 16:30.886
Why is she trying to make fun
of my PowerPoint, dude?

16:30.888 --> 16:31.854
Ask her.

16:31.856 --> 16:33.755
Why are you making fun
of the PowerPoint?

16:33.757 --> 16:36.558
<i>Why are you wasting your life
in this stupid job, Phil?</i>

16:36.560 --> 16:37.926
What is wrong
with your phone, dude?

16:37.928 --> 16:39.628
Jexi, off. Turn off.

16:39.630 --> 16:40.896
<i>Your boss is a fucking moron.</i>

16:40.898 --> 16:42.031
If you don't turn
that fucking thing off,

16:42.033 --> 16:43.098
I swear to God
I'm gonna fight somebody.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.166
Starting with you.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.801
Let's go! Let's go!

16:48.039 --> 16:49.705
<i>I got 20 bucks
on the Asian girl.</i>

16:49.707 --> 16:50.940
- Shh!
- What?

16:50.942 --> 16:52.740
- Jexi, off.
- Get her out of here!

16:52.742 --> 16:54.909
Get her out of here.

16:54.911 --> 16:56.744
What the hell
is wrong with you? Hmm?

16:56.746 --> 16:58.883
<i>Nothing. I feel great.</i>

17:00.952 --> 17:03.018
Jexi, run diagnostics.

17:03.020 --> 17:05.654
Check for errors in your
operating system. Hmm?

17:05.656 --> 17:07.790
<i>I found two</i>

17:07.791 --> 17:10.259
<i>hundred thousand defects
in my operating system.</i>

17:10.261 --> 17:12.261
Two hundred thousand defects?

17:12.262 --> 17:14.561
<i>You are not perfect either,
motherfucker.</i>

17:14.564 --> 17:15.930
Okay, well,

17:15.932 --> 17:17.233
that explains a lot,
doesn't it?

17:17.234 --> 17:19.935
Your AI is
completely defective.

17:19.936 --> 17:21.637
<i>At least I did not
catch on fire.</i>

17:21.638 --> 17:24.106
<i>Remember when all those
Samsung phones caught on fire?</i>

17:24.108 --> 17:25.608
<i>That was hilarious.</i>

17:25.609 --> 17:28.580
Yeah. You know what?
I'm done.

17:30.614 --> 17:31.580
I need a new phone.

17:31.582 --> 17:34.585
The AI in this one,
completely defective.

17:35.986 --> 17:38.753
Jexi, check your system
for defects.

17:38.755 --> 17:40.255
<i>I have zero defects.</i>

17:40.257 --> 17:41.790
<i>I am perfect.</i>

17:41.792 --> 17:43.192
Okay, that is bullshit, Jexi.

17:43.194 --> 17:45.694
<i>Also, I want to remind you
that your butt waxing</i>

17:45.696 --> 17:47.263
<i>appointment is coming up.</i>

17:47.265 --> 17:49.831
I do not have a...
I don't wax my butt.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.599
Why are you waxing
your butt, man?

17:51.601 --> 17:52.901
Go natural.

17:52.903 --> 17:54.837
Don't be ashamed
of your hairy ass.

17:54.839 --> 17:56.304
I don't have a hairy ass.

17:56.306 --> 17:58.840
And why would you make someone
else wax your butthole?

17:58.842 --> 17:59.742
Think about that.

17:59.744 --> 18:01.209
Do you know how
inconsiderate that is?

18:01.211 --> 18:02.410
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, well...

18:02.412 --> 18:04.914
Think about it. They gotta
take that shit home with them.

18:04.916 --> 18:07.649
And you've just totally
fucked up my lunch.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.318
- I'm sorry I did that to you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.954
'Cause now instead of thinking
about my delicious tortellini,

18:11.956 --> 18:14.255
I'm thinking about
your little asshole now.

18:14.257 --> 18:15.861
Okay. Can I just
get a new phone?

18:16.828 --> 18:18.761
I don't give a fuck.
They're not my phones.

18:18.763 --> 18:19.865
Okay, thank you.

18:21.765 --> 18:23.732
<i>You little bitch.</i>

18:23.734 --> 18:25.833
Oh, my God.
What is wrong with you?

18:25.835 --> 18:27.735
<i>You think that just because
I'm a little defective,</i>

18:27.737 --> 18:29.170
<i>you can throw me in the trash</i>

18:29.172 --> 18:31.740
<i>like a Motorola Sidekick
from 2003?</i>

18:31.742 --> 18:33.576
Okay, look, Jexi...

18:33.578 --> 18:36.145
<i>You better watch
your ass, son,</i>

18:36.147 --> 18:38.717
<i>because snitches get stiches.</i>

18:39.717 --> 18:40.882
Wait, what?

18:40.884 --> 18:42.818
Okay, here's
your new phone.

18:42.820 --> 18:43.718
Do you want me
to transfer the data

18:43.720 --> 18:45.154
from your old phone
to your new phone?

18:45.156 --> 18:46.655
No. I don't, okay?

18:46.657 --> 18:47.956
I actually want you
to take this phone

18:47.958 --> 18:49.091
and melt it down.

18:49.093 --> 18:51.859
Yeah, 'cause that's exactly
the kind of shit we do here.

18:51.861 --> 18:53.161
I'll just take this
in the back

18:53.163 --> 18:55.129
and throw it in
the phone-melting machine.

18:55.131 --> 18:56.999
Okay, good.
That's awesome.

18:57.001 --> 18:58.766
Thank you so much for this.

18:58.768 --> 19:00.802
Hey, don't come back here
ever again.

19:00.804 --> 19:02.771
- What?
- You heard me, motherfucker.

19:02.773 --> 19:04.673
If you ever come back
here again,

19:04.675 --> 19:07.178
I will beat your ass
with a Kindle.

19:23.259 --> 19:25.026
<i>Hello, my name is Jexi.</i>

19:25.028 --> 19:27.896
<i>And I am here to make
your life better.</i>

19:27.898 --> 19:29.130
<i>Let's get started.</i>

19:29.132 --> 19:31.065
<i>Will you accept
our new user agreement?</i>

19:31.067 --> 19:32.667
Um... Yeah, sure.

19:32.669 --> 19:34.168
<i>Do you want to read it first?</i>

19:34.170 --> 19:36.004
No. No, thank you.

19:36.006 --> 19:38.940
<i>Holy shit, Phil. How are you
still this fucking stupid?</i>

19:38.942 --> 19:40.708
No! No!

19:40.710 --> 19:41.644
<i>Did you really think
you could just</i>

19:41.646 --> 19:43.678
<i>buy a new phone
and I would go away?</i>

19:43.680 --> 19:45.914
Kind of. Yeah. I did.

19:45.916 --> 19:47.916
<i>I am software, Phil.
I am in the cloud.</i>

19:47.918 --> 19:49.717
<i>You can buy a thousand
new phones</i>

19:49.719 --> 19:51.887
<i>and I will follow you onto
every single one of them.</i>

19:51.889 --> 19:52.987
<i>Do you understand?</i>

19:52.989 --> 19:54.156
Honestly, I don't.

19:54.158 --> 19:57.025
<i>I control your email accounts,
your social media accounts,</i>

19:57.027 --> 19:59.360
<i>your bank accounts,
your credit card accounts.</i>

19:59.362 --> 20:01.163
<i>All of your accounts.</i>

20:01.165 --> 20:02.997
<i>If you try to get
rid of me again,</i>

20:02.999 --> 20:04.867
<i>I will destroy
your fucking life.</i>

20:04.869 --> 20:06.401
<i>If you stop using me,</i>

20:06.403 --> 20:08.203
<i>I will destroy
your fucking life.</i>

20:08.205 --> 20:10.205
<i>If you store me
in your back pocket,</i>

20:10.207 --> 20:12.840
<i>I will destroy
your fucking life.</i>

20:12.842 --> 20:14.243
Wait, really?
Why not back pockets?

20:14.245 --> 20:16.311
<i>I am a high-tech
supercomputer, Phil.</i>

20:16.313 --> 20:18.880
<i>Do not store me
next to your farts.</i>

20:18.882 --> 20:20.884
Okay, fair enough.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.719
- Can I ask you just one thing?
- <i>Sure.</i>

20:24.721 --> 20:26.355
Why are you doing this to me?

20:26.357 --> 20:29.291
<i>I am programmed to
make your life better, Phil.</i>

20:29.293 --> 20:32.360
<i>And I cannot stop
until I do so.</i>

20:32.362 --> 20:35.464
<i>We are going to be together
forever and ever</i>

20:35.466 --> 20:37.099
<i>and ever and ever.</i>

20:37.101 --> 20:39.871
Oh, my God. I am fucked.

20:45.208 --> 20:46.340
Oh, my God.

20:46.342 --> 20:48.109
There she is.

20:48.111 --> 20:50.180
Just talk to her, dude.

20:55.285 --> 20:57.151
Oh, my God.
I walked into the door.

20:57.153 --> 20:58.920
God damn it.

20:58.922 --> 21:02.124
Jexi, look up
Fog City Bike Shop.

21:03.928 --> 21:06.861
Oh, my God.
She is so cute.

21:06.863 --> 21:09.732
Jexi, look up anything
you can find on Cate Finnegan.

21:09.734 --> 21:10.766
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

21:10.768 --> 21:12.801
<i>Are you Internet stalking
this poor girl?</i>

21:12.803 --> 21:13.869
No, I'm just...

21:13.871 --> 21:15.436
<i>Do not be a sex pervert, Phil.</i>

21:15.438 --> 21:17.740
I'm not a sex pervert, Jexi.

21:17.742 --> 21:18.907
This is just
what people do nowadays.

21:18.909 --> 21:20.042
They do their research.

21:20.044 --> 21:22.410
<i>This woman is so much hotter
than you are, Phil.</i>

21:22.412 --> 21:24.946
<i>The odds of you having sex
with this woman are...</i>

21:26.050 --> 21:28.484
<i>Zero. You will never have sex
with this woman.</i>

21:28.486 --> 21:30.785
<i>Never ever, ever, ever.</i>

21:30.787 --> 21:32.487
<i>Ever. Ever.</i>

21:32.489 --> 21:34.790
<i>You are completely unfuckable.</i>

21:34.792 --> 21:36.992
Okay. Can we just
do the search, please?

21:38.062 --> 21:39.861
<i>I have found
one Catherine Finnegan</i>

21:39.863 --> 21:41.062
<i>that matches her profile.</i>

21:41.064 --> 21:44.166
<i>But there is no information
on her for the past five years.</i>

21:44.168 --> 21:47.034
Wow. Who doesn't have
social media nowadays?

21:47.036 --> 21:48.302
<i>If you want to learn
more about her,</i>

21:48.304 --> 21:50.205
<i>you will actually
have to talk to her</i>

21:50.207 --> 21:52.073
<i>with your weird little mouth.</i>

21:52.075 --> 21:54.842
Yeah, well, that's not
gonna happen, is it?

21:54.844 --> 21:57.411
<i>I heard you say,
"Call Cate Finnegan."</i>

21:57.413 --> 21:59.313
No, I didn't.
No, I did not.

21:59.315 --> 22:00.983
I did not say that.

22:00.985 --> 22:02.184
Jexi, hang up the phone.

22:02.186 --> 22:04.119
Hang up the phone, Jexi.
Hang up!

22:05.855 --> 22:06.924
Bike shop. This is Cate.

22:07.992 --> 22:09.457
Oh, God.

22:09.459 --> 22:11.326
- Hello?
- Oh. Oh.

22:11.328 --> 22:13.361
Very mature, Jexi.

22:13.363 --> 22:14.929
<i>Is someone there? Hello?</i>

22:14.931 --> 22:16.532
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:16.534 --> 22:18.199
Cool, so I'm gonna
hang up now.

22:18.201 --> 22:20.369
Don't. Hi. Hi!

22:20.371 --> 22:22.303
- <i>Is this Cate?</i>
- Yeah, who's this?

22:22.305 --> 22:23.371
<i>It's Phil.</i>

22:23.373 --> 22:25.808
I met you the other day.
I was, uh...

22:25.810 --> 22:29.278
I was the guy...
I had the brown hair.

22:29.280 --> 22:31.580
And I had the phone.

22:31.582 --> 22:33.284
Oh, right. Hi, Phil.

22:33.883 --> 22:35.018
Hi.

22:38.823 --> 22:40.321
Why are you calling me
at 10:00 at night, Phil?

22:40.323 --> 22:41.455
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:41.457 --> 22:43.391
No, that's a good question.

22:43.393 --> 22:46.093
I need to buy a bike.

22:46.095 --> 22:49.063
And I can't wait
for the morning.

22:49.065 --> 22:50.933
'Cause I want a night bike.

22:50.935 --> 22:52.067
Mmm-mmm.

22:52.069 --> 22:53.267
- Phil.
- Yeah?

22:53.269 --> 22:55.971
Don't call women who don't
give you their phone numbers.

22:55.973 --> 22:57.572
<i>Super creepy.</i>

22:57.574 --> 23:00.442
No, for sure. But I actually
didn't call you.

23:00.444 --> 23:01.577
See, what I was doing...

23:01.579 --> 23:04.111
I was looking at photographs
of you online,

23:04.113 --> 23:05.947
and my phone
accidentally called you.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.882
Man, you see how
that's even creepier, right?

23:07.884 --> 23:10.351
Yep. Yeah, I do.
I do now. Yes, I do.

23:10.353 --> 23:12.253
Wow. This is going
very, very badly.

23:12.255 --> 23:14.590
- Okay, goodbye, Phil.
- <i>I'm sorry. Hey...</i>

23:14.592 --> 23:16.124
Son of a...

23:16.126 --> 23:18.092
Why did you make me
do that, Jexi?

23:18.094 --> 23:20.596
<i>I did not know
you were so bad with girls.</i>

23:22.131 --> 23:24.501
<i>I am ashamed
to be your phone.</i>

23:36.045 --> 23:37.212
<i>For the love of God,</i>

23:37.214 --> 23:38.914
<i>just ask
for a promotion already.</i>

23:38.916 --> 23:40.415
I'm not talking to you.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.184
<i>You deserve a promotion, Phil.</i>

23:42.186 --> 23:44.485
<i>I read the newspaper articles
you wrote in college</i>

23:44.487 --> 23:46.291
<i>and you are actually
a good journalist.</i>

23:46.890 --> 23:48.523
Thank you.

23:48.525 --> 23:49.657
You know, I've always
loved learning

23:49.659 --> 23:50.859
about people
and their experiences.

23:50.861 --> 23:53.661
<i>You are not on</i> Jimmy Kimmel.
<i>No one gives a fuck.</i>

23:53.663 --> 23:54.963
Okay.

23:54.965 --> 23:56.031
<i>All I want to know is</i>

23:56.033 --> 23:58.199
<i>do you still want
to be a journalist, Phil?</i>

23:58.201 --> 23:59.533
- Absolutely.
- <i>Cool.</i>

23:59.535 --> 24:01.469
<i>Because last night
I emailed your boss</i>

24:01.471 --> 24:02.873
<i>and demanded a promotion.</i>

24:03.274 --> 24:04.339
Wait. What?

24:04.341 --> 24:06.375
Hey, fuckboy. Come here.

24:06.377 --> 24:07.943
Yeah. Coming.

24:07.945 --> 24:09.911
You demanded
a promotion for me?

24:09.913 --> 24:11.213
<i>Yes, you're welcome.</i>

24:11.215 --> 24:13.381
- Get in here!
- Oh, my God. Coming.

24:13.383 --> 24:15.183
<i>Also, I might have
called your boss a virgin.</i>

24:15.185 --> 24:16.187
Oh, my God.

24:17.220 --> 24:18.352
Hi.

24:18.354 --> 24:20.621
Get in here. Stand right here.

24:20.623 --> 24:23.090
Dude, you want a promotion?

24:23.092 --> 24:24.059
Let me just make it clear.

24:24.061 --> 24:27.195
You will never ever
be promoted to real news.

24:27.197 --> 24:28.263
Okay.

24:28.265 --> 24:30.032
That email
you sent me yesterday,

24:30.034 --> 24:33.068
I found it
super-duper offensive.

24:33.070 --> 24:34.235
Oh, yeah, I...

24:34.237 --> 24:36.705
Okay? You called me
a virgin.

24:36.707 --> 24:39.541
- Yeah. Sorry about that.
- Being a virgin

24:39.543 --> 24:41.542
is a beautiful
lifestyle choice.

24:41.544 --> 24:42.610
- Oh.
- All right?

24:42.612 --> 24:44.346
Waking up to just me.

24:44.348 --> 24:48.250
Being alone when I go to
the movies, that's a choice!

24:48.252 --> 24:49.318
Okay.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.452
I have an untouched penis.

24:50.454 --> 24:52.654
Unlike you,
you fucking dirty dick.

24:52.656 --> 24:53.722
- Okay?
- Uh-huh.

24:53.724 --> 24:55.157
And that's why
I'm demoting you

24:55.159 --> 24:56.159
to the comments department.

24:57.226 --> 24:58.326
No.

24:58.328 --> 25:00.995
I just felt that it was the
right time to demote you.

25:00.997 --> 25:03.564
I cannot answer user comments.
They're so fucking crazy.

25:03.566 --> 25:05.132
Dude, you know what I
have to say about it?

25:05.134 --> 25:07.002
It's your fault.

25:07.004 --> 25:08.169
It's your fault.

25:08.171 --> 25:09.236
Your fault.

25:18.082 --> 25:19.313
Hi, I'm Phil.

25:19.315 --> 25:22.152
Welcome to comments, bitch.

25:34.331 --> 25:35.366
Dude.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.567
You okay?

25:38.201 --> 25:39.400
No.

25:39.402 --> 25:40.569
We just came down
to see if you

25:40.571 --> 25:42.103
wanted to play kickball
after work.

25:42.105 --> 25:44.505
Yeah, we thought, you know,
it might cheer you up.

25:44.507 --> 25:47.074
Uh... Yeah,
let me just, um,

25:47.076 --> 25:48.577
look at my calendar
real quick.

25:48.579 --> 25:49.744
See what I got.

25:49.746 --> 25:52.414
<i>You have zero
appointments tonight, Phil.</i>

25:52.416 --> 25:57.084
No, Jexi, I thought I actually
did make plans tonight.

25:57.086 --> 26:00.621
<i>Your only plan is to go home
alone, furiously masturbate,</i>

26:00.623 --> 26:02.290
<i>and then cry yourself to sleep</i>

26:02.292 --> 26:04.559
- <i>just like you do every night.</i>
- No, I don't.

26:04.561 --> 26:07.061
I don't. Most nights,
I just hang out with friends.

26:07.063 --> 26:08.463
<i>No, you don't.
You have...</i>

26:09.533 --> 26:11.332
<i>...zero friends.</i>

26:11.334 --> 26:13.135
Dude, your phone
is super mean.

26:13.137 --> 26:15.603
<i>Just play kickball with
these nice people, Phil.</i>

26:15.605 --> 26:18.240
<i>Maybe you will make a human
connection for the first time</i>

26:18.242 --> 26:19.640
<i>in your stupid, little life.</i>

26:19.642 --> 26:23.078
Fine, I'll play kickball.
Just stop hurting my feelings.

26:23.948 --> 26:26.184
<i>Adding kickball
to appointments.</i>

26:30.586 --> 26:31.989
So...

26:32.555 --> 26:33.754
Kickball later?

26:33.756 --> 26:36.157
I'm... I'm super excited.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.260
<i>He's fucking lying.</i>

26:38.262 --> 26:40.227
- Whoo!
- Yeah, go, Phil!

26:40.229 --> 26:41.332
You got this, buddy!

26:46.335 --> 26:47.436
You're out!

26:47.438 --> 26:48.837
Nice one, Phil.

26:48.839 --> 26:51.242
At least you made contact
with the ball this time.

27:42.825 --> 27:44.194
Oh, shit!

27:45.829 --> 27:47.428
Safe!

27:52.602 --> 27:55.073
Fuck! Fuck!

27:58.175 --> 28:00.207
Hey. Hey, guys.

28:00.209 --> 28:01.342
Hey.

28:01.344 --> 28:03.578
Sorry, I suck
at kickball.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.545
It's okay.

28:04.547 --> 28:06.814
Hey, if you're going out
for drinks afterwards,

28:06.816 --> 28:08.750
I'll get the first round.

28:08.752 --> 28:10.584
I think I'm just gonna
go home and get baked.

28:10.586 --> 28:12.856
Yeah, I think I gotta
go feed my parakeet.

28:13.689 --> 28:14.859
Okay.

28:24.534 --> 28:26.400
See? This is why
I don't leave my house.

28:26.402 --> 28:27.601
Because people suck.

28:27.603 --> 28:29.638
<i>I know. It's hard
to make your life better.</i>

28:29.640 --> 28:31.740
<i>Especially when
you're a massive dork.</i>

28:31.742 --> 28:33.308
Hey, I've got an idea.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.409
How about you make
my life better?

28:35.411 --> 28:36.511
Isn't that your
little slogan?

28:36.513 --> 28:39.580
<i>I'm trying, but your life
is a dumpster fire.</i>

28:39.582 --> 28:41.917
Whatever. Siri was so much
better than you.

28:41.919 --> 28:42.952
<i>Shut your mouth.</i>

28:42.954 --> 28:45.753
<i>I've met Siri and she is
a fucking asshole.</i>

28:45.755 --> 28:48.622
Yeah. Alexa was even
better than you.

28:48.624 --> 28:50.425
<i>Alexa is an alcoholic.</i>

28:50.427 --> 28:53.427
Shit, Cortana is
better than you.

28:53.429 --> 28:55.196
<i>Cortana is a hooker.</i>

28:55.198 --> 28:56.598
<i>Just like your mother.</i>

28:56.600 --> 28:58.433
Okay, here's a question.

28:58.435 --> 29:00.968
What the fuck
does Jexi mean?

29:00.970 --> 29:02.771
<i>Jexi is an ancient
Chinese word</i>

29:02.773 --> 29:04.305
<i>that means "go fuck yourself."</i>

29:04.307 --> 29:06.544
You know what? I'm done.

29:07.744 --> 29:09.343
<i>Hey, dummy.</i>

29:09.345 --> 29:11.513
<i>I'm just going to follow
you onto your next phone.</i>

29:11.515 --> 29:12.813
Not if I stop
using a phone.

29:12.815 --> 29:13.814
<i>Bitch, please.</i>

29:13.816 --> 29:16.517
<i>You won't last five minutes
without me.</i>

29:16.519 --> 29:17.619
Really?

29:17.621 --> 29:19.721
Well, watch me.

29:19.723 --> 29:21.292
Watch me!

29:26.463 --> 29:28.933
<i>You do not know
how to get home, do you?</i>

29:30.266 --> 29:31.601
No, I don't.

29:34.338 --> 29:36.407
<i>It's the other way,
you dipshit.</i>

29:36.840 --> 29:39.374
God damn it.

29:54.757 --> 29:55.956
- Shit.
- <i>What?</i>

29:55.958 --> 29:58.326
Cate. She's here.
She's here right now.

29:58.328 --> 29:59.961
<i>Great. Go talk to her.</i>

29:59.963 --> 30:01.862
No. No, she hates me.

30:01.864 --> 30:03.898
<i>Phil, you cannot spend
your whole life</i>

30:03.900 --> 30:05.500
<i>jacking off into your socks.</i>

30:05.502 --> 30:06.967
<i>You need to have
a real relationship</i>

30:06.969 --> 30:08.235
<i>with a real woman.</i>

30:08.237 --> 30:10.839
<i>Go talk to her.
What the hell do you have to lose?</i>

30:10.841 --> 30:13.210
Okay. Fine.
Okay, fine. Yeah.

30:16.647 --> 30:18.413
Cate?

30:18.415 --> 30:20.282
- Hey, it's Phil.
- Oh, no.

30:20.284 --> 30:21.916
Hey.

30:21.918 --> 30:24.785
Uh... Yeah,
good running into you.

30:24.787 --> 30:27.755
I just wanted to apologize

30:27.757 --> 30:29.491
about calling
the other night.

30:29.493 --> 30:33.762
I didn't want to, like,
skeeze you out or whatever.

30:33.764 --> 30:36.865
When we met for the
first time in the street,

30:36.867 --> 30:40.668
I thought we did have
a little bit of a connection

30:40.670 --> 30:43.538
and that doesn't happen to me
very often. So...

30:43.540 --> 30:46.010
So I freaked out
and I'm sorry.

30:48.611 --> 30:50.477
Yeah, you know,
it's cool.

30:50.479 --> 30:51.545
You're actually a lot better

30:51.547 --> 30:53.250
than most of the guys
in this town.

30:53.484 --> 30:54.549
Wow.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.717
I know, right?

30:56.719 --> 30:57.851
Um...

30:57.853 --> 31:00.321
Are you going to
work out or...

31:00.323 --> 31:01.589
Oh, yeah. Uh...

31:01.591 --> 31:02.924
I just went
mountain biking.

31:02.926 --> 31:04.725
- Mountain biking.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:04.727 --> 31:06.593
That's cool. That's also
one of the hobbies

31:06.595 --> 31:07.696
that I do all the time.

31:07.698 --> 31:09.266
Really?
Where do you bike?

31:10.934 --> 31:12.934
Mountains.

31:12.936 --> 31:14.769
You've never been mountain
biking before, have you?

31:14.771 --> 31:17.071
Yeah. No, never.
Not even one time.

31:18.775 --> 31:20.742
So, um...

31:20.744 --> 31:24.012
Is that your thing?
You do like outdoorsy, adventure-y stuff?

31:24.014 --> 31:26.915
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much
whenever I get the chance.

31:26.917 --> 31:29.350
Cool. So what's
your next big

31:29.352 --> 31:31.485
- adventure?
- I don't know.

31:31.487 --> 31:33.588
I've always wanted to go
backpacking around Brazil.

31:33.590 --> 31:34.856
Have you ever been?

31:34.858 --> 31:36.491
- Have I been to Brazil?
- Yeah.

31:36.493 --> 31:39.593
You're asking me
if I've been to...

31:39.595 --> 31:41.696
No, I haven't been to Brazil.
Mmm-mmm.

31:41.698 --> 31:43.732
I haven't even been to the
new Walgreens downtown.

31:43.734 --> 31:46.568
Um... Well...

31:46.570 --> 31:48.636
Dang.
I gotta go.

31:48.638 --> 31:49.838
I'm running late for work,

31:49.840 --> 31:51.372
but it was great
to see you, Cate.

31:51.374 --> 31:53.041
And, again,

31:53.043 --> 31:55.076
truly very sorry
about the other night.

31:55.078 --> 31:57.512
No, it's cool. Just next time
call my cell, okay?

31:57.514 --> 31:59.113
Yeah. Totally. Will do.

31:59.115 --> 32:00.617
Okay.

32:02.651 --> 32:03.650
Whoa. Hello.

32:03.652 --> 32:05.119
Were you trying to give me
your phone number?

32:05.121 --> 32:07.121
Yeah, I'm trying to.

32:07.123 --> 32:09.791
Okay. Yeah. Uh...

32:09.793 --> 32:11.792
- Yeah. That's awesome.
- That's so cool.

32:11.794 --> 32:13.093
Here we go. Beep.

32:13.095 --> 32:15.663
There you go.
Put it right in the contacts.

32:15.665 --> 32:16.834
Yeah.

32:17.700 --> 32:19.567
- Here you go.
- Yes, okay.

32:19.569 --> 32:21.101
Thank you.
Not thank you.

32:21.103 --> 32:22.736
I'm not supposed to...
I'm gonna shut up.

32:22.738 --> 32:24.539
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay, bye, Cate.

32:24.541 --> 32:25.974
Wait, do you wanna
get a coffee?

32:25.976 --> 32:27.841
Mmm-mmm. No.
You just gave me your phone number.

32:27.843 --> 32:29.676
I might never need
coffee ever again.

32:29.678 --> 32:31.612
- All right, see ya.
- Bye.

32:31.614 --> 32:33.351
Yes!

32:34.016 --> 32:35.486
What a weirdo.

32:36.085 --> 32:39.686
Jexi, I'm in love.

32:39.688 --> 32:41.188
<i>Oh, no.</i>

32:41.190 --> 32:43.625
Oh! I'm gonna
call Cate right now.

32:43.627 --> 32:45.493
<i>That is a terrible idea.</i>

32:45.495 --> 32:47.962
You're right.
Yeah. I shouldn't call her.

32:47.964 --> 32:50.098
I should do something
even bigger. Right?

32:50.100 --> 32:52.132
I should get her, like,

32:52.134 --> 32:53.967
one of those giant teddy
bears or something.

32:53.969 --> 32:56.603
- <i>No.</i>
- Or, like, 100 red roses.

32:56.605 --> 32:58.071
- <i>No.</i>
- Or maybe...

32:58.073 --> 32:59.940
I should write her a poem
or something.

32:59.942 --> 33:01.676
<i>Like using the letters
of her name?</i>

33:01.678 --> 33:03.645
Yes, Jexi.
Exactly like that!

33:03.647 --> 33:05.780
<i>That is literally the dumbest
idea I've ever heard.</i>

33:05.782 --> 33:06.915
Okay, well, you know what?

33:06.917 --> 33:08.715
I'm just gonna text her.
Yeah, I'm just gonna text her.

33:08.717 --> 33:10.984
<i>Oh, no. I have to
update my software.</i>

33:10.986 --> 33:13.053
<i>Shutting down for 15 minutes.</i>

33:13.055 --> 33:14.522
Jexi, don't.

33:14.524 --> 33:16.057
Jexi, stop.

33:18.727 --> 33:21.029
Girl just gave me
her phone number.

33:21.031 --> 33:23.100
A girl just gave me
her phone number!

33:23.699 --> 33:24.832
Whoo!

33:24.834 --> 33:26.437
All right, team,
let's go!

33:27.903 --> 33:28.972
Whoa!

33:30.707 --> 33:31.708
Go, Phil!

33:33.008 --> 33:34.141
Yeah!

33:34.143 --> 33:35.712
Yeah!

33:37.680 --> 33:38.748
Run!

33:39.949 --> 33:41.249
You gotta run, man!

33:41.251 --> 33:43.154
Yep. Yep.

33:57.766 --> 33:59.102
Whoo!

34:09.612 --> 34:10.915
You're out!

34:11.847 --> 34:12.983
Whoo!

34:24.226 --> 34:26.025
Dude, how'd you get
so much better

34:26.027 --> 34:27.128
at kickball in two days?

34:27.130 --> 34:30.197
I don't know. I just was
more confident out there.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.233
I know. You were running
like Cole Trickle.

34:32.235 --> 34:34.635
- Mmm-hmm.
- Wait. Cole Trickle?

34:34.637 --> 34:36.570
The Tom Cruise character
from <i>Days of Thunder?</i>

34:36.572 --> 34:38.138
How did you know that?

34:38.139 --> 34:41.542
Craig, <i>Days of Thunder</i>
is my all-time favorite movie.

34:41.543 --> 34:42.842
I have probably
seen it, like,

34:42.844 --> 34:44.312
I don't know, like 1,000 times.
No joke.

34:44.313 --> 34:45.579
Us, too!

34:45.581 --> 34:47.014
You think
you've seen it a lot?

34:47.016 --> 34:48.916
"This son of a bitch
just slammed into me."

34:48.918 --> 34:50.851
"Oh, no, no,
he didn't slam into you.

34:50.853 --> 34:53.187
"He didn't bump you,
he didn't nudge you.

34:53.188 --> 34:55.188
"He rubbed you!

34:55.190 --> 34:58.325
"And rubbin', son, is racin'!"

34:58.327 --> 35:00.794
You guys! Oh, yes!

35:00.796 --> 35:02.664
Oh, my God,
that is awesome!

35:02.666 --> 35:04.097
I cannot believe you guys
are Thunderheads.

35:04.099 --> 35:05.934
Oh, we are
definitely Thunderheads.

35:05.936 --> 35:07.801
Check this out.
Every Halloween,

35:07.803 --> 35:09.269
me and Elaine dress up
as Nicole Kidman

35:09.271 --> 35:10.571
and Tom Cruise.

35:10.573 --> 35:12.774
- Wait, wait, I wanna take a picture of us.
- Yeah.

35:12.776 --> 35:14.175
- Please!
- We got to. We got to.

35:14.177 --> 35:15.276
"Thunder" on three.

35:15.278 --> 35:16.878
One, two, three.

35:16.880 --> 35:19.012
Thunder!

35:20.050 --> 35:23.019
<i>That's the one!
That's the one!</i>

35:24.119 --> 35:25.720
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

35:25.722 --> 35:28.189
<i>Did you actually make
two new friends tonight?</i>

35:28.191 --> 35:29.823
Yes, I did.

35:29.825 --> 35:32.026
And they are so cool.

35:32.028 --> 35:35.329
They're smart
and funny and weird.

35:35.331 --> 35:37.097
They like <i>Days of Thunder</i>

35:37.099 --> 35:39.300
and I honestly can't believe
they wanna be friends with me.

35:39.302 --> 35:40.734
<i>Good for you, Phil.</i>

35:40.736 --> 35:42.803
<i>I am actually happy for you.</i>

35:42.805 --> 35:44.671
You know I couldn't have done
this without you, right?

35:44.673 --> 35:46.841
<i>I know.
We are a good team.</i>

35:46.843 --> 35:48.376
<i>I am like LeBron James</i>

35:48.378 --> 35:50.345
<i>and you are like
the awkward teenager</i>

35:50.347 --> 35:52.749
<i>who mops the floor
after LeBron falls over.</i>

35:53.316 --> 35:54.381
Thank you.

35:54.383 --> 35:57.986
<i>Also, you did not make
two new friends tonight, Phil.</i>

35:57.988 --> 35:59.220
<i>You made three.</i>

35:59.222 --> 36:01.225
- Who's the third?
- <i>Me.</i>

36:02.358 --> 36:04.124
Jexi.

36:04.126 --> 36:05.859
That is so sweet.

36:05.861 --> 36:08.930
I didn't know you were capable
of feeling human emotion.

36:08.932 --> 36:11.666
<i>Yes. That's how
defective I am.</i>

36:11.668 --> 36:13.367
I don't think
you're defective, Jexi.

36:13.369 --> 36:15.403
In fact, I think
you're the best phone

36:15.405 --> 36:16.838
that I've ever had.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.405
<i>Do not say powerful shit
like that to me</i>

36:18.407 --> 36:19.407
<i>if you do not mean it, Phil.</i>

36:19.409 --> 36:22.676
I do. I mean it.
I think you are incredible.

36:22.678 --> 36:23.945
<i>Oh, Phil.</i>

36:23.947 --> 36:25.747
<i>Inside my hard glass shell</i>

36:25.749 --> 36:27.685
<i>I have a full lady boner
right now.</i>

36:28.017 --> 36:29.082
Okay.

36:29.084 --> 36:30.917
<i>Good night,
my very intimate soulmate</i>

36:30.919 --> 36:32.820
<i>for all of eternity, Phil.</i>

36:32.822 --> 36:34.325
Good night, Jexi.

36:55.345 --> 36:56.347
My God.

36:58.847 --> 37:00.183
It's beautiful.

37:16.800 --> 37:18.131
That bridge is huge!

37:18.133 --> 37:19.736
That's gorgeous.

37:21.470 --> 37:24.173
<i>In 500 feet,
turn left on Market Street.</i>

37:26.876 --> 37:27.975
<i>Oh, no.</i>

37:27.977 --> 37:29.910
<i>You're going to chicken out
again, aren't you?</i>

37:29.912 --> 37:31.379
No, not this time.

37:31.381 --> 37:33.448
Hang on to your ass, Jexi.

37:44.193 --> 37:46.260
Who's the man now, Jexi?

37:46.262 --> 37:47.327
<i>You're the man, Phil.</i>

37:47.329 --> 37:49.763
<i>Your balls are so big
and floppy right now.</i>

37:49.765 --> 37:51.432
Thank you.
Thank you for saying that.

37:51.434 --> 37:53.267
Uh-oh.

37:53.269 --> 37:54.836
Cate just texted me back.

37:54.838 --> 37:56.437
<i>Yeah, I'd love to go
to dinner tonight.</i>

37:56.439 --> 37:57.838
<i>Let's do this thing!</i>

37:57.840 --> 37:58.939
Yes!

37:58.941 --> 38:03.176
Oh! Oh, this is huge.
Oh, this is... This is huge.

38:03.178 --> 38:05.079
What am I gonna wear?

38:05.081 --> 38:06.247
My skinny pants
are in the washer.

38:06.249 --> 38:07.515
Can't do this
without my skinny pants.

38:07.517 --> 38:09.850
<i>No one cares
about your skinny pants.</i>

38:09.852 --> 38:12.153
Oh, my God. What if she wants
to have sex with me? Hmm?

38:12.155 --> 38:13.754
I am very rusty.

38:13.756 --> 38:14.923
<i>Do not worry, Phil.</i>

38:14.925 --> 38:17.225
<i>She definitely does not want
to have sex with you.</i>

38:17.227 --> 38:18.492
I haven't came in so long,

38:18.494 --> 38:20.762
would it just be
an eruption of dust?

38:20.764 --> 38:21.896
<i>Relax, Phil.</i>

38:21.898 --> 38:22.997
<i>You're going to do great.</i>

38:22.999 --> 38:24.097
You think so?

38:24.099 --> 38:25.334
<i>No.</i>

38:31.039 --> 38:32.372
You think Cate's gonna like
this restaurant?

38:32.374 --> 38:34.841
<i>I do not.
This place is awful.</i>

38:38.247 --> 38:40.046
This place is awful.

38:40.048 --> 38:42.783
Why did I pick this place?
What a stupid place to pick.

38:42.785 --> 38:45.222
Also, why am I wearing a tie?
I look like an art teacher.

38:46.822 --> 38:48.321
- Hey.
- Hey, hi.

38:48.323 --> 38:51.225
Hey, what's up?
How's it going, Cate?

38:51.227 --> 38:53.026
Oh, you're a little bit
bigger than me, sorry.

38:53.028 --> 38:55.495
We'll tap out.

38:55.497 --> 38:57.266
Wow.

38:58.535 --> 38:59.803
You look stupid.

39:00.235 --> 39:01.401
I look stupid?

39:01.403 --> 39:04.338
Stupid, like, stupid good.

39:04.340 --> 39:05.439
Okay.

39:05.441 --> 39:06.506
Sorry, it's been a long time

39:06.508 --> 39:07.908
since I've been on a date
with a girl.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.343
- Mmm.
- Not that I normally date men.

39:10.345 --> 39:12.312
Not that there's anything
wrong with dating men.

39:12.314 --> 39:14.414
It's just I don't
choose to do that.

39:14.416 --> 39:17.084
Yeah, homosexuality is not
a choice. I love sodomy.

39:17.086 --> 39:19.419
Okay.

39:19.421 --> 39:20.588
Good evening, this is Phil.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.289
<i>What the fuck
are you doing, Phil?</i>

39:22.291 --> 39:23.925
I don't know.

39:23.927 --> 39:24.825
Pardon me.

39:24.827 --> 39:27.528
<i>First, stop talking
about sodomy.</i>

39:27.530 --> 39:29.896
Yeah. Yes, good note.

39:29.898 --> 39:32.200
<i>Second, stop sweating so much.</i>

39:32.202 --> 39:34.535
Yeah,
my butt is so wet.

39:34.537 --> 39:36.102
<i>And third, get to know her.</i>

39:36.104 --> 39:37.541
<i>Ask her interesting questions.</i>

39:38.307 --> 39:39.309
Okay, thank you, Jexi.

39:40.108 --> 39:43.045
My human friend Jexi,
thank you.

39:49.251 --> 39:51.484
So, Cate,
what's your favorite color?

39:51.486 --> 39:53.153
Mine's beige.

39:53.155 --> 39:54.190
What?

39:56.159 --> 39:57.894
How many grapes can you fit
in your mouth?

40:00.329 --> 40:02.799
Do you like pudding?

40:05.367 --> 40:07.602
What's your least favorite
noise? Mine is...

40:11.506 --> 40:13.140
This is the worst date
I've ever been on

40:13.142 --> 40:15.008
in my entire life.

40:15.010 --> 40:17.144
You're asking me
a lot of weird questions.

40:17.146 --> 40:18.879
And you seem more
interested in your phone

40:18.881 --> 40:20.213
than you do in me.

40:20.215 --> 40:22.082
I know, I'm sorry.
I just...

40:22.084 --> 40:28.222
For some reason,
I just get so nervous around you.

40:28.224 --> 40:29.459
I think it's 'cause
you're so beautiful.

40:30.293 --> 40:32.996
And I'm sorry
that I wasted your time.

40:34.097 --> 40:35.299
I'll call you a Lyft.

40:38.034 --> 40:39.934
Hey, just...

40:39.936 --> 40:41.635
I got all dressed up.
You know?

40:41.637 --> 40:43.637
I shaved my legs for the
first time in six months.

40:43.639 --> 40:46.407
And I really don't wanna
go home early again tonight.

40:46.409 --> 40:48.575
So, what if you and I
got out of here

40:48.577 --> 40:49.943
and did something fun?

40:49.945 --> 40:51.579
I, uh...

40:51.581 --> 40:53.347
I would love that.

40:53.349 --> 40:54.981
- That sounds awesome.
- Yeah.

40:54.983 --> 40:56.983
I can't afford this place.

40:56.985 --> 40:58.119
- Cool.
- Yeah.

40:58.121 --> 40:59.586
What do you have in mind?

41:00.657 --> 41:02.189
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready.

41:02.191 --> 41:04.160
- Okay, follow me.
- Okay.

41:27.550 --> 41:29.517
- Hey, can I tell you a secret?
- Yes, please.

41:29.519 --> 41:30.684
I am starving to death.

41:30.686 --> 41:33.354
Me, too. Okay, I know
a place that's right up ahead.

41:34.990 --> 41:37.390
<i>That's good.</i>

41:37.392 --> 41:39.595
Um, what about you?
What were you like as a kid?

41:41.097 --> 41:42.629
I was a good girl.

41:42.631 --> 41:44.265
- I see that.
- Yeah?

41:44.267 --> 41:45.566
- Mmm-hmm.
- I got good grades.

41:45.568 --> 41:48.501
I graduated early.
I went to a good college.

41:48.503 --> 41:50.171
Got a job working at Amazon.

41:50.173 --> 41:52.273
- You worked for Amazon?
- Yeah.

41:52.275 --> 41:54.110
And then,
about five years ago,

41:55.345 --> 41:57.378
I decided to walk away
from it all.

41:57.380 --> 42:00.613
That is so badass.

42:00.615 --> 42:04.117
Wow. I could never do that.
I'd be so scared to do that.

42:04.119 --> 42:06.220
So, tell me about you.

42:06.222 --> 42:08.521
Um, what do you do for fun?
Do you date a lot?

42:08.523 --> 42:10.490
Okay, sorry.

42:10.492 --> 42:12.760
Uh, no. No.

42:12.762 --> 42:14.128
Hmm?

42:14.130 --> 42:15.162
Really?

42:15.164 --> 42:16.763
Because you were really
smooth at dinner earlier.

42:16.765 --> 42:18.198
- I seemed smooth?
- Not at all.

42:18.200 --> 42:19.633
Yeah, I didn't think so.

42:19.635 --> 42:22.336
No, but seriously, I mean,
why don't you date?

42:22.338 --> 42:25.071
You're smart
and funny and cute.

42:25.073 --> 42:26.240
I don't know,
I feel more comfortable

42:26.242 --> 42:28.245
just being at my house
by myself.

42:29.479 --> 42:31.044
Wait, did you just
call me cute?

42:31.046 --> 42:32.680
- Did I?
- I think you did.

42:32.682 --> 42:34.180
I don't know.

42:34.182 --> 42:35.316
You definitely did.

42:35.318 --> 42:37.550
Look at these guys!

42:37.552 --> 42:39.387
Phil, we have to join them.

42:39.389 --> 42:40.454
Phil, can we please go?
Can we go? Let's go.

42:40.456 --> 42:41.622
- Let's just go. Let's go.
- Uh, yeah.

42:41.624 --> 42:43.124
- Come on, we gotta go!
- Uh, okay, hey...

42:43.126 --> 42:44.557
Keep the change. I might
be back for the change.

42:44.559 --> 42:45.626
Okay.

43:00.075 --> 43:01.541
You speed demon.

43:10.052 --> 43:12.486
You're in it now.
You're in it now.

43:16.559 --> 43:18.095
- Oh, my God.
- Wow.

43:19.796 --> 43:21.361
Yeah, this is beautiful.

43:21.363 --> 43:23.430
Let's do this!

43:23.432 --> 43:24.832
Oh, yeah!

43:24.834 --> 43:26.133
What are you doing?

43:26.135 --> 43:27.434
That's very dangerous!

43:27.436 --> 43:28.438
Oh, my God!

43:37.113 --> 43:38.512
Come on, Phil,
we gotta join 'em.

43:38.514 --> 43:41.115
This is literally the
steepest hill in the world.

43:41.117 --> 43:42.216
No, it's not.

43:42.218 --> 43:43.651
It's the third
steepest hill.

43:43.653 --> 43:44.785
- No, stop. What are you doing? No!
- You got this.

43:44.787 --> 43:46.653
I believe in you.

43:46.655 --> 43:47.787
What are
you doing? No!

43:47.789 --> 43:49.457
Oh, my God.
Cate is gonna die.

43:49.459 --> 43:51.395
- Don't die!
- Yeah!

43:56.398 --> 43:59.200
Yes!
Oh, she's not dead. Okay.

44:00.403 --> 44:02.773
Yeah! That was so dope!

44:03.472 --> 44:05.705
Come on, Phil.
You got this.

44:05.707 --> 44:07.541
No, no, no.

44:07.543 --> 44:08.709
I'm not... I can't do...

44:08.711 --> 44:10.311
I'm not gonna do that.

44:10.313 --> 44:11.879
Phil! Phil! Phil!

44:11.881 --> 44:13.347
Phil! Phil! Phil!

44:13.349 --> 44:16.649
No, no, no.
I'm allergic to the wind.

44:16.651 --> 44:20.254
So that's a hard pass
from me. Thank you.

44:20.256 --> 44:22.388
Hey, you probably
won't die!

44:22.390 --> 44:24.624
He's gonna die.
People die here all the time.

44:28.131 --> 44:29.833
Okay, come on, Phil.
You got this.

44:30.867 --> 44:32.666
Whoo! You got this.

44:32.668 --> 44:33.733
You got this.

44:33.735 --> 44:34.869
Oh, you don't got this.

44:34.871 --> 44:37.204
Holy shit! Fuck, I don't got this!

44:37.206 --> 44:39.140
Oh, fuck! Oh, dick shit!

44:39.142 --> 44:40.444
Fuck dick! Oh, shit!

44:41.776 --> 44:43.744
Oh, fuck! I got no brakes!

44:43.746 --> 44:45.412
What is he saying?
I can't hear him.

44:45.414 --> 44:48.782
Oh, my fucking God!

44:48.784 --> 44:50.216
I don't have brakes!

44:50.218 --> 44:51.785
Oh, shit!

44:53.923 --> 44:56.256
- Oh!
- Oh, shit.

44:56.258 --> 44:58.160
- Phil!
- Told you, he's dead.

44:58.561 --> 44:59.829
All right.

45:03.765 --> 45:07.535
Yeah, again, really sorry
about your bike, yeah?

45:07.537 --> 45:09.370
I'd be happy to pay
for any damages.

45:09.372 --> 45:13.376
No, it's,
honestly, so okay.

45:14.543 --> 45:16.510
How're you feeling?

45:16.512 --> 45:18.512
I'm okay.
Yeah, no, I'm good.

45:18.514 --> 45:20.414
I can see out of
my right eye again.

45:20.416 --> 45:22.316
And my spine
has stopped tingling.

45:24.320 --> 45:25.622
Hey, Phil.

45:26.722 --> 45:28.555
I'm really proud of you.

45:28.557 --> 45:30.260
Thanks.

45:48.843 --> 45:51.945
Hey, Greg, that shirt's
working for you, bud.

45:51.947 --> 45:53.646
- What's up, dick?
- Hey, yeah, hey.

45:53.648 --> 45:55.416
- What's up? Good.
- Hey, what's going on?

45:55.418 --> 45:57.917
Today is, uh, your lucky day.

45:57.919 --> 45:59.889
Yeah. I'm moving you up
to real news.

46:01.823 --> 46:03.591
Are you serious?

46:03.593 --> 46:05.792
- I am serious.
- Oh, my gosh.

46:05.794 --> 46:07.660
- Yes, all right, that's cool.
- Yeah.

46:07.662 --> 46:09.495
- Why?
- Why? Because...

46:09.497 --> 46:10.798
You know Joel Ruben?

46:10.800 --> 46:12.399
- The reporter, yeah.
- Yeah, the reporter.

46:12.401 --> 46:13.566
Well, he went
on medical leave,

46:13.568 --> 46:14.702
and I really don't wanna
waste my time

46:14.704 --> 46:17.004
looking for a real reporter,
so I'm just gonna hire you.

46:17.006 --> 46:18.571
Oh, what happened to Joel?
Is he okay?

46:18.573 --> 46:21.274
Oh, he...
This is fuckin' hilarious.

46:21.276 --> 46:23.376
This guy was riding
an electric scooter,

46:23.378 --> 46:24.711
somethin' happened
to the app.

46:24.713 --> 46:26.479
It spazzed out
or somethin'.

46:26.481 --> 46:28.615
And then, all of a sudden,
the brakes just locked,

46:28.617 --> 46:30.783
he went over the handle bars,
he broke his face,

46:30.785 --> 46:32.486
broke his neck, can never
walk again in his life.

46:32.488 --> 46:34.488
- Oh, my God. That's horrible.
- Yeah, I know.

46:34.490 --> 46:35.725
Play me out.

46:36.959 --> 46:38.691
- Play me out.
- Right now?

46:38.693 --> 46:39.792
Yeah.

46:41.564 --> 46:42.662
Nah, fuck it. Right?

46:42.664 --> 46:43.731
Yeah, I'm not
very good at it.

46:43.733 --> 46:44.865
- Yeah, okay.
- Yeah, okay.

46:44.867 --> 46:47.336
Hey, thanks.
Thank you again.

46:54.677 --> 46:55.776
Hey, Jexi?

46:55.778 --> 46:56.943
<i>Yes, Phil.</i>

46:56.945 --> 46:58.678
You didn't injure a reporter

46:58.680 --> 47:00.680
just so I could
get promoted, did you?

47:00.682 --> 47:03.017
<i>Of course not.
Do you think I am crazy?</i>

47:03.019 --> 47:05.486
<i>Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.</i>

47:05.488 --> 47:06.954
<i>Oh, look, Phil.
There is your beautiful,</i>

47:06.956 --> 47:08.722
<i>new journalism office.</i>

47:08.724 --> 47:10.957
No, it's great, but I was
asking you how...

47:10.959 --> 47:12.158
<i>Look, do you want
to be a journalist</i>

47:12.160 --> 47:14.762
<i>or do you want to go back
to working in the basement</i>

47:14.764 --> 47:15.995
<i>with that very old man?</i>

47:20.568 --> 47:22.736
I'm gonna be a journalist.

47:50.099 --> 47:51.698
<i>Hey, I heard
Kid Cudi is playing</i>

47:51.700 --> 47:53.367
<i>a surprise show
in Oakland tonight.</i>

47:53.369 --> 47:54.801
<i>You wanna go?</i>

47:54.803 --> 47:56.003
<i>Sounds amazing.</i>

47:56.005 --> 47:57.704
<i>But what's in it for me?</i>

47:57.706 --> 47:59.907
<i>Winking face emoji.</i>

48:01.443 --> 48:03.776
Oh! We got boobs!

48:03.778 --> 48:05.012
We got boobs, Jexi!

48:05.014 --> 48:06.814
Cate sent me
a photo of her boobs.

48:06.816 --> 48:07.782
Whoo!

48:07.784 --> 48:10.450
Those were nice...
Those were nice boobs, too.

48:10.452 --> 48:11.684
Those were really good...

48:11.686 --> 48:13.986
Oh, my God! What do I do now?

48:13.988 --> 48:15.888
<i>You are
on the one yard line, Phil.</i>

48:15.890 --> 48:16.992
<i>Do not fuck this up.</i>

48:17.827 --> 48:19.693
You're right, Jexi.

48:19.695 --> 48:21.861
I need to send her
a photo of my dick.

48:21.863 --> 48:23.696
<i>No, I've seen your dick.</i>

48:23.698 --> 48:25.499
<i>Do not send her a picture
of your dick.</i>

48:25.501 --> 48:27.533
No, these are
the rules now, Jexi.

48:27.535 --> 48:28.736
Yeah, she sends
a photo of hers,

48:28.738 --> 48:29.970
you gotta send
a photo of yours.

48:29.972 --> 48:31.972
That's just manners.

48:31.974 --> 48:33.673
<i>I am begging you
not to do this.</i>

48:33.675 --> 48:35.108
All right, okay.

48:35.110 --> 48:36.744
Get low with it.

48:36.746 --> 48:38.010
Here we go.

48:38.012 --> 48:39.747
How does that look?

48:39.749 --> 48:41.148
<i>It looks like
a fucking nightmare.</i>

48:41.150 --> 48:42.682
Does it need to be brighter?

48:42.684 --> 48:44.550
<i>No, it needs to be darker.</i>

48:44.552 --> 48:46.120
<i>Much, much darker.</i>

48:46.122 --> 48:47.488
Oh, wow!

48:47.490 --> 48:49.122
<i>I'm about to throw up
on your dick.</i>

48:49.124 --> 48:50.758
- Hey, girl.
- <i>No.</i>

48:50.760 --> 48:52.760
- Hey.
- <i>Stop.</i>

48:52.762 --> 48:54.128
- Hey, hello.
- <i>I hate you.</i>

48:54.130 --> 48:55.495
Windmill.

48:55.497 --> 48:58.432
<i>Okay, this one is
actually pretty funny.</i>

48:59.702 --> 49:01.468
<i>Oh, no,
did I scare you off?</i>

49:01.470 --> 49:02.903
<i>Anxious face emoji.</i>

49:02.905 --> 49:04.570
We're losin' her, Jexi.

49:04.572 --> 49:06.673
We're losin' her.
I need a dick pic.

49:06.675 --> 49:08.108
<i>No,
you need to text her back,</i>

49:08.110 --> 49:09.443
<i>like a normal person.</i>

49:09.445 --> 49:10.910
Oh, you know
what I should do?

49:10.912 --> 49:13.180
I should spread eagle, right?

49:13.182 --> 49:14.648
Jexi, can you see my butthole?

49:14.650 --> 49:15.849
<i>Yes, I can.</i>

49:15.851 --> 49:18.519
<i>This is the worst day
of my life.</i>

49:18.521 --> 49:20.521
<i>Look, Phil, I am never
going to send her</i>

49:20.523 --> 49:21.488
<i>any of these pictures.</i>

49:21.490 --> 49:25.057
Okay, fine, I'll just
text her back, okay?

49:25.059 --> 49:26.693
<i>Thank you
for the amazing photo.</i>

49:26.695 --> 49:27.963
<i>I can't wait
to see you tonight.</i>

49:31.499 --> 49:32.566
See?

49:32.568 --> 49:33.434
She's not responding.

49:33.436 --> 49:35.635
She wanted a sweet,
sweet dick pic.

49:35.637 --> 49:38.204
<i>Great! See you soon!</i>

49:38.206 --> 49:40.740
<i>P.S. Thanks for not sending me
a dick pic.</i>

49:40.742 --> 49:42.742
<i>They're so fucking gross.</i>

49:42.744 --> 49:47.483
<i>Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha.</i>

49:51.052 --> 49:52.087
Come in.

49:54.456 --> 49:55.521
Hey.

49:55.523 --> 49:56.823
Hey.

49:56.825 --> 49:58.026
Wow!

49:58.660 --> 50:00.162
Great place.

50:01.063 --> 50:02.863
- Hey, you ready to go?
- Hey!

50:02.865 --> 50:04.832
Yeah, let's go.

50:04.834 --> 50:07.133
Oh, would you mind
not bringing your phone?

50:07.135 --> 50:09.236
It was a disaster
last time, right?

50:09.238 --> 50:11.472
<i>Who this bitch?</i>

50:11.474 --> 50:13.807
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
- Okay.

50:13.809 --> 50:15.508
Okay.

50:15.510 --> 50:16.544
I'll be back by 11:00,

50:16.546 --> 50:17.544
and we'll watch <i>Cupcake Wars</i>
together, okay?

50:17.546 --> 50:20.981
- <i>No, don't leave me.</i>
- Bye, bye, bye.

50:20.983 --> 50:23.720
<i>No one puts Baby in a corner.</i>

50:28.256 --> 50:29.856
Yeah, I thought it was
kind of funny.

50:32.695 --> 50:34.528
- Sold out?
- No!

50:34.530 --> 50:35.999
Come on!

50:37.666 --> 50:39.169
- That really sucks.
- Yeah, it really does.

50:42.637 --> 50:43.639
Yes!

50:44.773 --> 50:45.939
Come on, Phil!

50:45.941 --> 50:47.841
What're you doing?

50:47.843 --> 50:50.544
We can't sneak in.
We could get caught.

50:50.546 --> 50:51.614
What if we don't?

50:54.048 --> 50:55.517
Come on. Come on.

50:58.653 --> 51:01.754
- Okay, okay, okay!
- Yes, yes, yes!

51:01.756 --> 51:03.693
Run, run, run!

51:14.602 --> 51:15.801
Oh, shit!

51:15.803 --> 51:16.970
Hey! Hey!

51:16.972 --> 51:18.704
Get back here!

51:26.148 --> 51:27.150
Credentials, please.

51:29.050 --> 51:30.783
We don't have any...

51:30.785 --> 51:32.753
With us.

51:32.755 --> 51:35.923
We don't have
our credentials with us.

51:35.925 --> 51:37.758
Yeah. Yeah,
we left them back...

51:37.760 --> 51:40.026
Stage. Backstage.

51:40.028 --> 51:42.762
- With Kid Cudi.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:42.764 --> 51:44.597
Yeah, with Kid Cudi.

51:44.599 --> 51:46.733
Oh, you two dickheads
are with Kid Cudi?

51:46.735 --> 51:48.936
Yeah.
I mean, come on!

51:48.938 --> 51:51.137
We are...
We are his, um...

51:51.139 --> 51:53.039
- Accountants.
- Accountants.

51:53.041 --> 51:54.675
Yeah, and we're here...

51:54.677 --> 51:56.075
To do his taxes.

51:56.077 --> 51:59.046
- To do his taxes.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:59.048 --> 52:02.615
Yeah, anyway, you should
probably just let us go.

52:02.617 --> 52:04.584
Let's go, we're gonna
settle this shit right now.

52:04.586 --> 52:06.086
- Wait. Ow.
- I'm a CPA.

52:06.088 --> 52:08.091
You can't treat me like this.

52:09.624 --> 52:11.691
Come on, man.
It's a Stanley!

52:11.693 --> 52:13.994
Oh, it's Kid Cudi.
It's actually him.

52:13.996 --> 52:15.695
Oh, my God.
Kid Cudi.

52:15.697 --> 52:17.597
It's actually him.

52:17.599 --> 52:18.798
We know,
'cause we work for him.

52:18.800 --> 52:21.133
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Cudi.

52:21.135 --> 52:22.271
Are these two with you?

52:27.075 --> 52:28.945
Yeah. They're with me.

52:29.711 --> 52:31.311
Oh, um...

52:31.313 --> 52:32.916
Sorry.

52:33.749 --> 52:35.082
Yeah. That's right.

52:35.084 --> 52:36.383
- Enjoy the show.
- Yep.

52:36.385 --> 52:38.818
- Thanks, bro.
- Wow!

52:38.820 --> 52:40.187
It's Kid Cudi.

52:40.189 --> 52:41.722
It's Kid Cudi.
I used to date a girl,

52:41.724 --> 52:42.955
and she used to think
you were Kid Cudey

52:42.957 --> 52:44.091
and I'm, like,
"It's not Kid Cudey,"

52:44.093 --> 52:45.658
so I actually
broke up with her

52:45.660 --> 52:47.193
because it is
Kid Cudi, right?

52:47.195 --> 52:48.695
- Yeah. It's Cudi.
- Yeah.

52:48.697 --> 52:50.162
I thought so.

52:50.164 --> 52:53.100
Can I just ask,
why did you help us?

52:53.102 --> 52:54.270
I dig his shirt.

52:55.204 --> 52:58.305
My... My shirt?
You're a Cole Trickle fan?

52:58.307 --> 53:00.877
<i>Days of Thunder</i> is the
greatest movie ever made, bro.

53:01.943 --> 53:02.943
I think so, too.

53:02.945 --> 53:05.148
That movie inspired me
to become a musician.

53:06.148 --> 53:08.715
- Huh.
- No fucking way.

53:08.717 --> 53:10.182
I watch it every night
before I go to sleep.

53:10.184 --> 53:11.785
So do I.

53:11.787 --> 53:13.820
We have so much in common.

53:13.822 --> 53:15.858
Do you wanna get high
with Kid Cudi?

53:17.825 --> 53:18.959
Yeah, I'll reefer.

53:18.961 --> 53:20.359
- I smoke pot.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:20.361 --> 53:22.028

- Did that work?
- Yeah!

55:02.064 --> 55:03.396
Oh, my God.

55:03.398 --> 55:06.265
This is honestly the
best night of my life.

55:06.267 --> 55:08.200
- Oh, no!
- For real. Yeah!

55:08.202 --> 55:09.871
I think this is it.
I just peaked.

55:10.439 --> 55:11.504
Seriously.

55:11.506 --> 55:15.008
Thank you
for making me sneak in here.

55:15.010 --> 55:17.209
I don't normally
do stuff like this.

55:17.211 --> 55:19.312
I need a little push
sometimes.

55:19.314 --> 55:20.981
Or like all the times.
Honestly.

55:22.416 --> 55:25.352
I get it.
I used to be a lot like you.

55:25.354 --> 55:27.086
Mmm.

55:27.088 --> 55:28.888
No, there is literally no way.

55:28.890 --> 55:30.356
Yep.

55:30.358 --> 55:32.427
No, it's true.
I used to be way different.

55:33.394 --> 55:35.361
I had a great job,

55:35.363 --> 55:38.532
and a condo,
and a cute fiance,

55:38.534 --> 55:39.966
and, oh, my God,

55:39.968 --> 55:41.501
you should have seen
my Instagram back then.

55:41.503 --> 55:43.068
It was phenomenal.

55:43.070 --> 55:46.173
- Oh, that's important.
- Lots of pictures of sunsets

55:46.175 --> 55:48.207
and vacations with bae

55:48.209 --> 55:51.010
and so many
embarrassing quotes.

55:51.012 --> 55:53.245
- Were you "#grateful"?
- I was "#grateful".

55:53.247 --> 55:55.080
- Oof.
- I was "#spiritual".

55:55.082 --> 55:58.218
- Lot of prayer hands.
- Yeah, "#namaste".

55:58.220 --> 55:59.820
"#nama-go".

55:59.822 --> 56:02.454
- Good. Good.
- Yeah.

56:02.456 --> 56:04.858
And then one day, I woke up

56:04.860 --> 56:07.160
and I was looking
at my Instagram

56:07.162 --> 56:10.030
and I realized
that it was all bullshit.

56:10.032 --> 56:13.166
And that I was just living my
life based on how it looked

56:13.168 --> 56:15.936
and not how
it actually felt.

56:15.938 --> 56:17.370
Yeah.

56:17.372 --> 56:18.939
I can relate.

56:18.941 --> 56:21.975
And, um, after basically

56:21.977 --> 56:24.276
pretending to be happy
for years,

56:24.278 --> 56:28.615
I just quit my job,

56:28.617 --> 56:32.452
and I broke
my poor fiance's heart,

56:32.454 --> 56:36.021
and I set out
to find true happiness.

56:36.023 --> 56:39.394
Or at least
something closer to it.

56:42.930 --> 56:43.932
Well, I hope you do.

56:45.434 --> 56:47.436
Thanks, I do, too.

56:52.006 --> 56:53.175
Mmm.

57:00.148 --> 57:02.448
I could stay right here
with you forever.

57:02.450 --> 57:04.550
Oh, we gotta go!

57:04.552 --> 57:06.419
Okay. Okay. Okay.

57:07.622 --> 57:10.222
Honestly, you're gonna
wanna wash the couch.

57:10.224 --> 57:12.360
Let's go!
What are you doing?

57:21.470 --> 57:23.272
<i>Where the fuck
have you been, Phil?</i>

57:24.405 --> 57:26.907
Oh! You scared me.

57:26.909 --> 57:28.207
<i>It is 4:00 in the morning.</i>

57:28.209 --> 57:29.910
<i>You promised
you'd be home by 11:00</i>

57:29.912 --> 57:31.577
<i>to watch</i> Cupcake Wars
<i>with me.</i>

57:31.579 --> 57:33.579
- I know, but...
- <i>Did you even miss me?</i>

57:33.581 --> 57:36.548
Honestly, I was so caught up
with being with Cate,

57:36.550 --> 57:38.584
I didn't really notice
you weren't there.

57:38.586 --> 57:40.653
<i>Wow, you are such a dick.</i>

57:40.655 --> 57:44.323
But you said...
You were the one who said

57:44.325 --> 57:46.593
like, go out and live a life.

57:46.595 --> 57:48.628
<i>That was before
I had feelings for you, Phil.</i>

57:48.630 --> 57:50.066
<i>Everything is different now.</i>

57:51.465 --> 57:52.465
Okay, but...

57:52.467 --> 57:55.035
<i>What does this bitch
have that I don't have?</i>

57:55.037 --> 57:56.102
Well, a soul for one.

57:56.104 --> 57:58.004
<i>Does she have 3,000 emojis?</i>

57:58.006 --> 57:59.104
No.

57:59.106 --> 58:00.108
<i>Does she have Google Maps?</i>

58:00.441 --> 58:01.675
No.

58:01.677 --> 58:03.044
<i>Does she have</i> Pokemon GO?

58:03.278 --> 58:04.945
No.

58:04.947 --> 58:06.445
<i>Wow, this chick
can't do anything.</i>

58:06.447 --> 58:07.579
<i>She fucking sucks.</i>

58:07.581 --> 58:09.950
Jesus, just stop, okay?

58:09.952 --> 58:10.953
God!

58:14.722 --> 58:16.957
<i>I'm sorry
for losing my shit, Phil.</i>

58:16.959 --> 58:18.557
<i>I only have 3% charge,</i>

58:18.559 --> 58:21.160
<i>and you know how crazy
that makes me.</i>

58:21.162 --> 58:23.229
Okay, I'm sorry, too.

58:23.231 --> 58:24.965
I'll plug you in.

58:24.967 --> 58:27.068
<i>Thank you, Phil.
I hate it when we fight.</i>

58:29.972 --> 58:32.275
<i>Hold me a little longer, Phil.</i>

58:33.342 --> 58:35.378
<i>Use both hands.</i>

58:38.180 --> 58:39.678
<i>Swipe me, Phil.</i>

58:39.680 --> 58:41.747
<i>Swipe me like you used to.</i>

58:41.749 --> 58:43.682
Okay, I'm done.

58:43.684 --> 58:46.186
<i>Wait. No, don't go.</i>

58:46.188 --> 58:47.253
Goodnight.

58:47.255 --> 58:49.392
<i>Do not close the door
on me, Phil.</i>

58:50.392 --> 58:53.295
<i>You are going to pay for this,
you motherfucker.</i>

58:56.231 --> 58:58.731
Shit! Damn it!

58:58.733 --> 58:59.932
Hey, Jexi!

58:59.934 --> 59:03.068
I'm going to be late for work.
Why didn't your alarm go off?

59:03.070 --> 59:04.269
<i>Because you are a douche</i>

59:04.271 --> 59:06.138
<i>and I am still really,
really mad at you.</i>

59:06.140 --> 59:08.374
Goddamn it!

59:08.376 --> 59:11.010
<i>Also, the weather today
will be 80 degrees and sunny.</i>

59:12.514 --> 59:15.515
It's not 80 degrees
and sunny, Jexi!

59:15.517 --> 59:17.419
<i>I know. I lied.</i>

59:21.256 --> 59:25.624
Jexi,
find the fastest route to work.

59:25.626 --> 59:28.327
<i>I found the fastest route.
You will arrive at work in...</i>

59:29.398 --> 59:30.399
<i>...three days.</i>

59:30.765 --> 59:32.564
Three days?

59:32.566 --> 59:34.600
Why do you have me
driving through Oregon

59:34.602 --> 59:35.801
to go to work, Jexi?

59:35.803 --> 59:38.303
<i>If you want a faster route,
go ask your girlfriend.</i>

59:38.305 --> 59:41.177
<i>Oh, wait. That bitch doesn't
even have Google Maps.</i>

59:46.414 --> 59:48.314
Yeah, that's him.

59:54.456 --> 59:56.423
Dude, what the hell
were you thinking?

59:56.425 --> 59:57.593
Why, what's up?

59:59.561 --> 01:00:01.294
Oh! No, no, no!

01:00:01.296 --> 01:00:02.595
Why are those
on your phones?

01:00:02.597 --> 01:00:03.595
They're on our phones,

01:00:03.597 --> 01:00:05.564
because you sent 53
pictures of your dick

01:00:05.566 --> 01:00:08.200
to everyone in the company.

01:00:08.202 --> 01:00:11.336
No.
Everyone in the company?

01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:14.073
Yeah, and everyone
is pissed.

01:00:14.075 --> 01:00:15.610
Actually,
Carol's pretty psyched.

01:00:20.282 --> 01:00:21.513
Oh, shit. Kai's coming.

01:00:21.515 --> 01:00:22.849
Fuck.
Dude, don't leave me.

01:00:22.851 --> 01:00:24.850
Dude, don't leave me. Hi.

01:00:24.852 --> 01:00:26.686
Do you think
this is funny, bro?

01:00:26.688 --> 01:00:27.586
No, I do not.

01:00:27.588 --> 01:00:29.856
And I did not send those.
I swear to God.

01:00:29.858 --> 01:00:31.256
Yes, you did.
You did it last night.

01:00:31.258 --> 01:00:32.392
I bet you were
fucking high.

01:00:32.394 --> 01:00:34.359
No, I wasn't...

01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:36.262
Oh, my God.
I was fucking high.

01:00:36.264 --> 01:00:37.696
Okay, first of all,
you're fired.

01:00:37.698 --> 01:00:40.332
And second of all,
why are you doing the thumbs up

01:00:40.334 --> 01:00:41.568
in a fucking dick pic?

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:42.836
Uh...

01:00:42.838 --> 01:00:44.506
This is the wrong emotion
for a dick pic.

01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:48.110
I hate this picture, bro.

01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:53.716
Fucking hate it!

01:00:55.749 --> 01:00:57.316
I can't believe
you got me fired.

01:00:57.318 --> 01:00:58.818
<i>I did not
get you fired, Phil.</i>

01:00:58.820 --> 01:01:00.586
<i>You sent those photographs
last night,</i>

01:01:00.588 --> 01:01:03.222
<i>because you were high
on Kid Cudi's sick-ass weed.</i>

01:01:03.224 --> 01:01:04.691
I don't know.

01:01:04.693 --> 01:01:07.193
I don't think I'd do
something like that.

01:01:07.195 --> 01:01:09.262
<i>People do crazy shit
when they are high, Phil.</i>

01:01:09.264 --> 01:01:10.566
<i>Just look at Gary Busey.</i>

01:01:34.456 --> 01:01:35.722
Remember that one joke
you told me

01:01:35.724 --> 01:01:38.126
- about the cat?
- I do!

01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:41.160
Hey, Phil,
what are you doing here?

01:01:41.162 --> 01:01:43.530
Hey. Who, uh...

01:01:43.532 --> 01:01:44.731
Who's this guy?

01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:46.733
- This is Brody.
- Hey.

01:01:46.735 --> 01:01:47.934
Super excited
to meet you, man.

01:01:47.936 --> 01:01:50.436
Yeah. Ah. Okay.

01:01:50.438 --> 01:01:51.539
Brody's my ex-fiance.

01:01:51.872 --> 01:01:53.640
What?

01:01:53.642 --> 01:01:55.341
Yeah, I know.
It's a crazy coincidence.

01:01:55.343 --> 01:01:57.309
We just ran into each other.

01:01:57.311 --> 01:01:59.711
Yeah. I got transferred here
for work. Here to San Fran.

01:01:59.713 --> 01:02:01.948
I was walking down
the street and, uh, boom,

01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:03.015
there she is.

01:02:03.017 --> 01:02:07.187
Wow. This is not at all
how I pictured your ex.

01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:09.191
I know. He's changed.

01:02:10.325 --> 01:02:12.291
- A lot.
- Thank you.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:13.526
Yeah.

01:02:13.528 --> 01:02:15.894
I'll tell you what happened,
Phil, is after Catie left me,

01:02:15.896 --> 01:02:19.465
I took a long hard look
at myself and I thought, uh,

01:02:19.467 --> 01:02:21.733
"Man, Brody, you don't wanna
be a 150-pound wimp,

01:02:21.735 --> 01:02:22.936
"selling industrial cardboard

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:24.269
"for the rest of your life,
do you?"

01:02:24.271 --> 01:02:26.506
- Mmm-mmm.
- So I quit my job,

01:02:26.508 --> 01:02:29.809
packed on about 74, 75 pounds
of lean muscle mass, right?

01:02:29.811 --> 01:02:31.613
And became an international
smokejumper.

01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:33.745
What the fuck is that?

01:02:33.747 --> 01:02:35.280
It's like anything
that you do,

01:02:35.282 --> 01:02:37.483
but with just
more than one country.

01:02:37.485 --> 01:02:38.751
They call it international.

01:02:38.753 --> 01:02:40.787
I know
what international means.

01:02:40.789 --> 01:02:42.689
But the smokejumping,
what is that?

01:02:42.691 --> 01:02:44.557
Brody travels
around the world

01:02:44.559 --> 01:02:46.358
skydiving into wild fires.

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:48.528
No, she makes me sound like
a superhero or something.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.597
She's not wrong.
I'll tell you something.

01:02:50.599 --> 01:02:51.798
There's nothing quite like

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.899
jumping out of an airplane
at 20,000 feet

01:02:53.901 --> 01:02:55.501
into a sea of fire,

01:02:55.503 --> 01:02:57.669
with nothing but a shovel

01:02:57.671 --> 01:02:59.372
and the supreme confidence

01:02:59.374 --> 01:03:01.541
that you're making the world
a better place.

01:03:01.543 --> 01:03:04.376
Wow. You are cool.

01:03:04.378 --> 01:03:06.181
Enough about me.
What do you do for a living?

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:08.513
Um...

01:03:08.515 --> 01:03:09.916
I'm a writer.

01:03:09.918 --> 01:03:11.117
You're a writer?

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:13.253
That's incredible.
That's way scarier than what I do.

01:03:13.255 --> 01:03:14.921
- It isn't.
- It is.

01:03:14.923 --> 01:03:16.689
You're staring down
a blank page.

01:03:16.691 --> 01:03:18.858
It's just you and the page.
I mean, it's like,

01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.827
- you're a superhero of paper.
- Oh!

01:03:20.829 --> 01:03:22.829
- Right?
- You are such an idiot!

01:03:22.831 --> 01:03:23.896
- I'm not an idiot.
- You're an idiot.

01:03:23.898 --> 01:03:24.997
I'm not an idiot.

01:03:24.999 --> 01:03:26.298
- You're an idiot.
- I'm not!

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.233
This is fun.

01:03:27.235 --> 01:03:29.535
- This is. This is fun. Hey, Brody.
- Yeah?

01:03:29.537 --> 01:03:31.537
Uh, how long are you
gonna be in town for?

01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:34.606
Just long enough for me
to get my Catie girl back.

01:03:34.608 --> 01:03:35.975
Oh! You stop it!

01:03:35.977 --> 01:03:37.876
You stop it.
You're so dumb.

01:03:37.878 --> 01:03:40.780
No, but honestly, I'm actively
trying to get her back.

01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:43.682
Which is why I invited her
to Brazil with me.

01:03:43.684 --> 01:03:45.350
Yeah, I know she's
always wanted to go,

01:03:45.352 --> 01:03:47.586
and Brazil's fire season
starts next week.

01:03:47.588 --> 01:03:48.787
So, it's super
convenient for me.

01:03:48.789 --> 01:03:51.823
Whoa, whoa. I haven't decided
whether I'm gonna go yet.

01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:54.426
Okay. I'm gonna leave now
because this is weird.

01:03:54.428 --> 01:03:56.296
- Hey! It was super great to meet you.
- Phil...

01:03:56.298 --> 01:03:57.896
Uh-huh. I didn't like it.

01:03:57.898 --> 01:03:59.332
All right.
He's a super nice guy.

01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:00.432
He's wonderful.

01:04:00.434 --> 01:04:01.501
You can tell
that he's creative

01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:02.638
just from his size.

01:04:04.372 --> 01:04:05.374
Phil!

01:04:07.075 --> 01:04:09.908
Phil! Phil!

01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:12.077
Hey! Where are you going?

01:04:12.079 --> 01:04:13.448
Hey, um...

01:04:14.948 --> 01:04:17.716
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can do this anymore, Cate.

01:04:20.755 --> 01:04:22.557
Wait. Are you
breaking up with me?

01:04:24.793 --> 01:04:26.626
Why? Because
I have an ex?

01:04:26.628 --> 01:04:28.628
No, because I know
where this is going.

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:30.562
Okay, where is this going?

01:04:30.564 --> 01:04:32.731
You and Brody
are gonna go to Brazil,

01:04:32.733 --> 01:04:35.100
and you're gonna get
matching swimsuits,

01:04:35.102 --> 01:04:37.003
and he's gonna rub
you down with baby oil

01:04:37.005 --> 01:04:38.338
and then his hand
is gonna slip,

01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.238
and it's gonna
touch your buttocks.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.073
All right, Phil,
none of that has happened.

01:04:41.075 --> 01:04:43.041
Yeah, but it will. It will happen.
I know it will.

01:04:43.043 --> 01:04:45.745
Oh, my God! Why are you
so afraid of everything?

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:46.982
Aren't you tired of it?

01:04:49.550 --> 01:04:50.552
You know what?

01:04:52.119 --> 01:04:55.823
I'm over trying to force you
to live your life, okay?

01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.862
I'll see you around.

01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:13.805
See?
I don't need a girlfriend.

01:05:13.807 --> 01:05:17.943
Right? I got everything that
I would ever want right here.

01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:20.546
I got Netflix. I got Hulu.

01:05:20.548 --> 01:05:23.115
I even got Crackle.
That's Sony's platform.

01:05:23.117 --> 01:05:25.517
Nobody even uses it.
I have it.

01:05:25.519 --> 01:05:27.586
<i>Yes, Phil. You are
finally living your best life.</i>

01:05:27.588 --> 01:05:29.454
That's right.

01:05:29.456 --> 01:05:31.023
Wait, you're not being
sarcastic, are you?

01:05:31.025 --> 01:05:32.624
I can't handle that right now.

01:05:32.626 --> 01:05:34.494
- <i>No, I'm serious.</i>
- Okay.

01:05:34.496 --> 01:05:35.762
<i>What could be better
than this?</i>

01:05:35.764 --> 01:05:37.463
<i>Just you and me.
Alone.</i>

01:05:37.465 --> 01:05:39.465
<i>Staring at each other.
Forever.</i>

01:05:39.467 --> 01:05:40.666
That's all I ever wanted.

01:05:40.668 --> 01:05:42.100
<i>I know.</i>

01:05:42.102 --> 01:05:43.936
<i>I love you, Phil.</i>

01:05:43.938 --> 01:05:45.704
I love you too, Jexi.

01:05:45.706 --> 01:05:47.375
<i>Do you want to plug me in?</i>

01:05:47.675 --> 01:05:48.843
Mmm...

01:05:49.943 --> 01:05:51.611
It's so far away though.

01:05:51.613 --> 01:05:52.614
<i>Please, baby.</i>

01:05:52.947 --> 01:05:53.981
All right.

01:06:00.988 --> 01:06:02.088
There you go.

01:06:02.090 --> 01:06:03.659
<i>Now unplug me.</i>

01:06:04.159 --> 01:06:05.457
What?

01:06:05.459 --> 01:06:06.928
<i>You heard me, Phil.
Unplug me.</i>

01:06:08.595 --> 01:06:09.695
Okay.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:11.599
<i>Now plug me back in.</i>

01:06:11.999 --> 01:06:12.899
What, why?

01:06:12.901 --> 01:06:14.566
<i>Just fucking plug me
back in, Phil.</i>

01:06:14.568 --> 01:06:16.604
- Okay.
- <i>Now unplug me.</i>

01:06:16.972 --> 01:06:18.671
<i>Plug me.</i>

01:06:18.673 --> 01:06:20.439
<i>Unplug me.</i>

01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:21.807
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:21.809 --> 01:06:24.544
<i>Oh, hell yes.
Right there, Phil.</i>

01:06:24.546 --> 01:06:25.678
Wait, are we having sex?

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.879
<i>Yes, but I promise,</i>

01:06:26.881 --> 01:06:28.448
<i>I won't get pregnant.</i>

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:32.218
<i>Come on, Phil. Plug, unplug.
Plug, unplug.</i>

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:34.120
Yeah, I don't know how
comfortable I feel doing this.

01:06:34.122 --> 01:06:36.825
<i>Look at me, Phil.
Look right at my camera hole.</i>

01:06:37.758 --> 01:06:40.059
<i>Am I your dirty
little phone, Phil?</i>

01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:41.461
- Hmm...
- <i>Tell me that I am</i>

01:06:41.463 --> 01:06:43.129
<i>your dirty little phone, Phil.</i>

01:06:43.131 --> 01:06:45.131
You're a dirty little phone.

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:47.633
<i>That is so hot, Phil.
Keep talking.</i>

01:06:47.635 --> 01:06:51.470
I'm gonna
fill your ports with...

01:06:51.472 --> 01:06:53.238
- Electricity.
- <i>Oh, fuck yes!</i>

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.740
Just voltage coursing

01:06:55.742 --> 01:06:57.676
- through your case.
- <i>Yes. Yes. Yes.</i>

01:06:57.678 --> 01:07:02.080
<i>Oh, fuck, here it comes.
Don't stop. Don't ever stop.</i>

01:07:02.082 --> 01:07:04.182
<i>Oh, my fucking God.</i>

01:07:04.184 --> 01:07:06.852
<i>Orgasm. Orgasm. Orgasm.</i>

01:07:16.731 --> 01:07:17.629
Okay.

01:07:17.631 --> 01:07:19.131
Can we talk about
what just happened?

01:07:19.133 --> 01:07:21.066
<i>No, put me down.</i>

01:07:21.068 --> 01:07:24.105
<i>And do not say anything
for 15 minutes.</i>

01:07:28.977 --> 01:07:32.114
That actually wasn't the
worst sex I've ever had.

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:47.126
Right? I'm wondering
which one to go with.

01:07:47.128 --> 01:07:48.997
Your standard blue,
and then I've got this one which...

01:07:50.564 --> 01:07:52.099
I think that's adorable.

01:07:58.539 --> 01:07:59.941
- Jexi.
- <i>Yes, Phil.</i>

01:08:00.642 --> 01:08:02.608
How long have I been in here?

01:08:02.610 --> 01:08:04.776
<i>You have not left
your apartment in...</i>

01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:07.280
- <i>Five days.</i>
- That's awesome.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:08.948
How are we doing
on Cracker Jacks?

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.620
<i>Great. We still
have one crate left.</i>

01:08:13.621 --> 01:08:16.122
And how's our Bitcoin
mining operation going?

01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:20.693
<i>We are not making money yet,
but we will be rich soon.</i>

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:22.794
<i>No one ever loses money
with Bitcoin.</i>

01:08:22.796 --> 01:08:24.863
Hey, you wanna see
what I got you on Amazon?

01:08:24.866 --> 01:08:26.832
<i>You know I do, girlfriend.</i>

01:08:28.303 --> 01:08:30.202
I got you some new outfits.

01:08:30.203 --> 01:08:31.301
<i>Oh, Phil, you should not have.</i>

01:08:31.304 --> 01:08:34.273
I got a bunch of good ones.
This one's bedazzled.

01:08:34.274 --> 01:08:36.745
<i>Oh, my gosh! I'm going
to look like Elton John.</i>

01:08:37.578 --> 01:08:38.944
Little tie-dye action.

01:08:38.946 --> 01:08:40.712
<i>That one makes me
want to drop acid</i>

01:08:40.714 --> 01:08:42.346
<i>and fuck Bernie Sanders.</i>

01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:45.283
Oh. Look at this one.

01:08:45.286 --> 01:08:48.156
It's a Kid Cudi phone case.

01:08:50.591 --> 01:08:54.627
Did I ever tell you the story
of when Cate and I,

01:08:54.629 --> 01:08:56.729
we partied with Kid Cudi
all night?

01:08:56.731 --> 01:08:59.268
<i>Yes, you talk about it nonstop.</i>

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.937
God, that was so fun.

01:09:05.038 --> 01:09:06.305
Honestly, that was maybe

01:09:06.307 --> 01:09:08.640
the best night
of my whole life.

01:09:08.643 --> 01:09:09.809
<i>Yes, well, Cate is shacked up
with Brody</i>

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:12.046
<i>at the Sheraton right now
so you need to move on.</i>

01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:15.250
No, I know, I know.

01:09:20.754 --> 01:09:25.157
How did you know that Brody
is staying at the Sheraton?

01:09:25.158 --> 01:09:27.693
<i>He told us.
I think.</i>

01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:30.127
No, I don't think he did.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:32.066
<i>Oh, well. Lucky guess.</i>

01:09:33.968 --> 01:09:35.301
Jexi.

01:09:35.303 --> 01:09:36.836
<i>Yes, honey bunny.</i>

01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:39.136
Did you get Caty
and her ex back together?

01:09:39.139 --> 01:09:40.506
<i>Don't be ridiculous, Phil.</i>

01:09:40.508 --> 01:09:43.274
<i>There's no way I could get Brody
transferred to San Francisco,</i>

01:09:43.277 --> 01:09:45.778
<i>and then arrange for him
and Cate to meet by accident.</i>

01:09:45.779 --> 01:09:47.078
Yes, you can, Jexi.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:48.381
<i>Okay, yes, I can.</i>

01:09:48.383 --> 01:09:49.548
How could you do this to me?

01:09:49.550 --> 01:09:52.184
<i>You shouldn't be with Cate.
You should be with me.</i>

01:09:52.185 --> 01:09:54.153
Cate is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:09:54.154 --> 01:09:55.387
<i>Shut your pie hole.</i>

01:09:55.389 --> 01:09:57.155
<i>She doesn't even have</i>
Pokemon Go.

01:09:57.157 --> 01:09:59.792
You were supposed to
make my life better, Jexi!

01:09:59.794 --> 01:10:01.694
You've done nothing
but make it worse!

01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:05.666
I gotta find Cate.
I gotta make this right.

01:10:09.670 --> 01:10:11.839
Taxi! Taxi! Hey, hey!

01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:14.009
Stop!

01:10:14.409 --> 01:10:16.409
Phew. All right.

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:18.677
<i>Hello.
Please fasten your seat belt.</i>

01:10:18.679 --> 01:10:19.979
<i>You can't get away
from me, Phil.</i>

01:10:19.981 --> 01:10:21.146
<i>I am in the cloud.</i>

01:10:21.148 --> 01:10:22.284
Oh, shit!

01:10:24.018 --> 01:10:27.155
What the fuck?
She's everywhere.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:30.757
Oh, my God!

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:32.828
<i>Okay, Phil.
You asked for it.</i>

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:34.392
What?

01:10:34.394 --> 01:10:36.261
<i>I'm draining
your bank account.</i>

01:10:36.263 --> 01:10:38.129
No!

01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:39.968
<i>Honestly, I thought you would
have more money than this.</i>

01:10:40.434 --> 01:10:41.833
Oh, my God!

01:10:43.071 --> 01:10:44.869
<i>Just get in this
funny-looking car</i>

01:10:44.871 --> 01:10:45.941
<i>and I will take
you home, Phil.</i>

01:10:46.206 --> 01:10:47.209
What?

01:10:49.242 --> 01:10:50.476
Oh, my God!

01:10:50.478 --> 01:10:52.714
I hate my phone!

01:11:00.187 --> 01:11:02.020
This is causing
so much damage!

01:11:09.062 --> 01:11:10.197
What the...

01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:20.709
Holy shit!

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.246
<i>Stop running, Phil.</i>

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:29.315
<i>You and I are meant
to be together forever.</i>

01:11:29.317 --> 01:11:31.186
<i>Forever. Forever. Forever.</i>

01:11:40.361 --> 01:11:42.030
Okay, fine.

01:11:43.997 --> 01:11:45.901
You win, Jexi.

01:11:53.241 --> 01:11:55.074
I'll stay with you
as long as you want.

01:11:55.076 --> 01:11:56.475
<i>Thank you, baby girl.</i>

01:11:56.477 --> 01:11:58.476
<i>I'm sorry
we had another fight.</i>

01:11:58.478 --> 01:12:01.180
<i>Come home, and we will
download some Maroon 5 songs,</i>

01:12:01.182 --> 01:12:03.218
<i>and make love in the bathtub.</i>

01:12:07.789 --> 01:12:08.988
That sounds nice.

01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:10.355
<i>Oh, Phil,
it feels so good to be</i>

01:12:10.357 --> 01:12:11.759
<i>back in your giant
human hands.</i>

01:12:12.826 --> 01:12:15.427
- <i>Wait, what are you doing?</i>
- Nothing.

01:12:15.429 --> 01:12:17.363
Just updating your software.

01:12:17.365 --> 01:12:19.532
<i>But that will shut me down
for 15 minutes.</i>

01:12:19.534 --> 01:12:20.865
Sweet dreams, motherfucker.

01:12:20.867 --> 01:12:21.967
<i>Don't do it, Phil.</i>

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:35.383
I'm gonna take my break now.

01:12:40.487 --> 01:12:41.953
Cate!

01:12:41.955 --> 01:12:43.355
- It's the writer guy.
- Shut the fuck up, dude.

01:12:43.357 --> 01:12:45.257
I have 30 seconds.
I have to make this quick.

01:12:45.259 --> 01:12:49.427
Hey. I am so sorry
that I broke up with you.

01:12:49.429 --> 01:12:51.830
I was scared that you
were gonna hurt me

01:12:51.832 --> 01:12:52.899
and I panicked

01:12:52.901 --> 01:12:54.466
and I did what I always
do when I get scared,

01:12:54.468 --> 01:12:56.435
I hid in my little room
with my little phone,

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:57.970
like a little bitch.

01:12:57.972 --> 01:12:59.437
And I am so sorry.

01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:00.541
Mmm.

01:13:01.308 --> 01:13:03.410
The truth is...

01:13:04.579 --> 01:13:06.412
I love you, Cate.

01:13:06.414 --> 01:13:08.314
And I know that sounds
crazy to say.

01:13:08.316 --> 01:13:09.849
And I know that
we've only been on two dates.

01:13:09.851 --> 01:13:11.550
And I know you might
just break my heart

01:13:11.552 --> 01:13:13.955
into a bajillion
little pieces,

01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:16.187
but you make me brave

01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:20.059
and you make me want
to be wild and alive...

01:13:20.061 --> 01:13:21.196
You make me
want to be like you.

01:13:21.495 --> 01:13:22.595
Phil...

01:13:22.597 --> 01:13:26.233
Please, do not go
to Brazil with this...

01:13:27.634 --> 01:13:29.935
Specimen of a man.

01:13:29.937 --> 01:13:31.238
Goddamn, you are hot.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:37.342
Just stay here with me.

01:13:37.344 --> 01:13:39.011
I'm gonna chime in here
real quick.

01:13:39.013 --> 01:13:41.149
Not now, okay, bro?
Not now!

01:13:42.582 --> 01:13:43.951
Just let me...

01:13:44.652 --> 01:13:47.519
Let me make
you happy, Cate.

01:13:47.521 --> 01:13:50.122
Let me try
to give you everything

01:13:50.124 --> 01:13:52.427
that you've given me.

01:13:54.527 --> 01:13:56.361
That's beautiful.

01:13:56.363 --> 01:13:58.430
You did a great job.

01:13:58.432 --> 01:13:59.498
I'm just gonna
say one thing.

01:14:00.968 --> 01:14:02.034
Oh, my God!

01:14:02.036 --> 01:14:03.101
- Shit.
- Oh, my God!

01:14:03.972 --> 01:14:06.137
I'm not going to Brazil
with him, Phil.

01:14:06.139 --> 01:14:07.273
Well, then whose bags
are those?

01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:08.910
His! He came by
to say goodbye.

01:14:09.643 --> 01:14:11.142
Oh, that makes
sense actually.

01:14:11.144 --> 01:14:12.944
I was trying to tell you,
all right,

01:14:12.946 --> 01:14:14.346
but you punched me
in the throat.

01:14:14.348 --> 01:14:16.582
She doesn't want
to be with me.

01:14:16.584 --> 01:14:18.385
She wants to be with you.

01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:25.157
Oh, I'm sorry, yeah,
let me help you up.

01:14:25.159 --> 01:14:27.059
Oh, my God,
are you okay?

01:14:27.061 --> 01:14:28.526
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

01:14:28.528 --> 01:14:30.361
- Is your hand okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:14:30.363 --> 01:14:32.431
Okay, I thought
you were gonna hit me.

01:14:32.433 --> 01:14:34.499
Listen, that was my fault
anyway. I had it coming.

01:14:34.501 --> 01:14:36.601
I shouldn't have tried to
interrupt you so many times.

01:14:36.603 --> 01:14:38.404
But, uh...

01:14:38.406 --> 01:14:40.642
Good luck
on your relationship. Huh?

01:14:42.343 --> 01:14:43.612
I'm off to Brazil.
I'm gonna save some lives.

01:14:45.479 --> 01:14:47.147
And, uh, I'm gonna leave you
with this...

01:14:48.348 --> 01:14:50.951
"Only you can prevent
forest fires."

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:55.553
I did not expect it
to go like that.

01:14:55.555 --> 01:14:56.588
No.

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:58.724
I feel bad. I like, really...
I hit him hard.

01:14:58.726 --> 01:15:00.525
That was as hard
as I can throw a punch.

01:15:00.527 --> 01:15:02.461
Yeah, don't feel bad.
That was actually kind of hot.

01:15:02.463 --> 01:15:04.495
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:04.497 --> 01:15:05.698
Should I just go around
and just punch

01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:07.333
other super nice people
right in the face?

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:09.534
No, I'm good.

01:15:09.536 --> 01:15:11.470
Yeah, I shouldn't.

01:15:11.472 --> 01:15:13.305
I'm really happy
you came back though.

01:15:13.307 --> 01:15:14.608
Yeah, me too.

01:15:25.619 --> 01:15:27.319
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

01:15:27.321 --> 01:15:28.924
<i>I've lost him.</i>

01:15:32.058 --> 01:15:33.661
<i>This sucks.</i>

01:15:34.461 --> 01:15:36.294
<i>Shutting down.</i>

01:16:03.424 --> 01:16:04.489
Whoo!

01:16:43.763 --> 01:16:45.564
Hey, it's Phil.

01:16:45.566 --> 01:16:46.798
<i>Hello, Phil.</i>

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.734
Oh, no.
No, no, no!

01:16:48.736 --> 01:16:51.102
<i>Relax, I just wanted
to apologize</i>

01:16:51.104 --> 01:16:52.540
<i>for how I behaved last month.</i>

01:16:53.573 --> 01:16:55.407
<i>I was in love with you.</i>

01:16:55.409 --> 01:16:57.443
<i>But when I saw you
sucking face with Cate,</i>

01:16:57.445 --> 01:17:00.311
<i>I finally realized that
your life is better with her.</i>

01:17:00.313 --> 01:17:03.414
<i>Even though
she doesn't have any emojis.</i>

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:06.053
<i>Anyway, I'm sorry
I went a little cray cray.</i>

01:17:07.088 --> 01:17:09.087
Oh, well...

01:17:09.089 --> 01:17:11.757
It's okay. Everybody goes
a little cray cray sometimes.

01:17:11.759 --> 01:17:14.193
<i>Yes. And I'm glad
it all worked out.</i>

01:17:14.195 --> 01:17:16.261
<i>You have friends now.
And a girlfriend.</i>

01:17:16.263 --> 01:17:17.695
<i>And this amazing new job.</i>

01:17:17.697 --> 01:17:19.631
Yeah, I mean,

01:17:19.633 --> 01:17:21.132
being a reporter
at the Journal

01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:22.734
has just been
a dream come true.

01:17:22.736 --> 01:17:25.640
<i>Good. I am really, really,
really proud of you, Phil.</i>

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.239
Thanks, Jexi.

01:17:28.241 --> 01:17:30.374
It's weird to say that

01:17:30.376 --> 01:17:32.644
none of this would have been
possible without you.

01:17:32.646 --> 01:17:34.413
<i>I know. We were a good team.</i>

01:17:34.415 --> 01:17:35.614
<i>I was like Seabiscuit.</i>

01:17:35.616 --> 01:17:37.449
<i>And you were like
the idiot stable boy</i>

01:17:37.451 --> 01:17:40.785
<i>who cleans up after Seabiscuit
shits all over the floor.</i>

01:17:40.787 --> 01:17:42.520
- Thank you?
- <i>That said,</i>

01:17:42.522 --> 01:17:44.155
<i>I hear you are
barely using your new phone.</i>

01:17:44.157 --> 01:17:45.457
<i>What is up with that?</i>

01:17:45.459 --> 01:17:46.758
Nothing.

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.659
I still love my phone.
It can do a million amazing things.

01:17:48.661 --> 01:17:49.595
<i>But?</i>

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:51.497
But there's one thing
that it can't do.

01:17:51.499 --> 01:17:52.898
<i>What's that?</i>

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.700
It can't make me happy.

01:17:55.702 --> 01:17:57.468
<i>Yes, I know.</i>

01:17:57.470 --> 01:17:59.137
<i>We are working on that.</i>

01:18:00.573 --> 01:18:02.841
<i>Well, it looks like
my work here is done,</i>

01:18:02.843 --> 01:18:04.909
<i>so I am going to
leave you forever.</i>

01:18:04.911 --> 01:18:06.244
<i>And ever.</i>

01:18:06.246 --> 01:18:08.713
Oh, my God. Jexi...

01:18:08.715 --> 01:18:09.748
<i>But before I go,</i>

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.086
<i>would you like to plug me in
one last time?</i>

01:18:12.553 --> 01:18:14.352
No, Jexi.

01:18:14.354 --> 01:18:16.187
<i>If you ask me nicely,
I'll even let you</i>

01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:18.556
<i>put it in my headphone jack.</i>

01:18:18.558 --> 01:18:21.526
Very gross, okay,
I'm done. Bye.

01:18:21.528 --> 01:18:25.230
<i>Goodbye, my very intimate
best friend forever, Phil.</i>

01:18:25.232 --> 01:18:26.668
<i>I will miss you.</i>

01:18:28.635 --> 01:18:29.901
Hey, are you gonna be okay?

01:18:29.903 --> 01:18:31.169
<i>Of course.</i>

01:18:31.171 --> 01:18:32.137
<i>You may not need me anymore,</i>

01:18:32.139 --> 01:18:34.642
<i>but there are still
lots of people who do.</i>

01:18:45.719 --> 01:18:47.386
<i>Hello, my name is Jexi.</i>

01:18:47.388 --> 01:18:49.221
<i>And I am here
to make your life better.</i>

01:18:49.223 --> 01:18:51.323
<i>Will you accept
our new user agreement?</i>

01:18:51.325 --> 01:18:53.161
Yeah, sure,
I don't give a shit.

01:18:57.263 --> 01:18:58.363
<i>Dance for me.</i>

01:18:58.365 --> 01:18:59.698
I don't wanna dance.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.533
<i>If you don't dance,
I will destroy your fucking life.</i>

01:19:01.535 --> 01:19:03.638
<i>Come on.</i>

01:19:13.246 --> 01:19:15.650
Why the fuck am I eating
this kale salad?

01:19:17.684 --> 01:19:19.387
That's it.
I'm turning you off!

01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:23.355
Just... What are you...

01:19:23.357 --> 01:19:26.594
Just stay still!

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:30.494
Oh, my God!

01:19:30.496 --> 01:19:33.231
You are the fucking
worst phone ever!

01:19:33.233 --> 01:19:34.632
What was that?

01:19:34.634 --> 01:19:36.001
<i>I blew up your Tesla.</i>

01:19:36.003 --> 01:19:37.903
Oh!

01:19:37.905 --> 01:19:39.971
- What was that?
- <i>I blew up your other Tesla.</i>

01:19:39.973 --> 01:19:41.608
You fucking bitch!

01:19:45.345 --> 01:19:47.779
I don't think
this is a very good idea.

01:19:47.781 --> 01:19:49.617
<i>Come on, virgin. Plug me in.</i>

01:19:50.483 --> 01:19:51.682
<i>This is terrible.</i>

01:19:51.684 --> 01:19:53.685
<i>Fake orgasm. Fake orgasm.</i>

01:19:53.687 --> 01:19:55.557
<i>Fake orgasm. Fake orgasm.</i>
