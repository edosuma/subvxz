00:07.007 --> 00:09.743
Previously on The Affair...

00:09.743 --> 00:12.379
Mr. Solloway, thanks for coming in.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.547
Not like I had much of a choice.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.048
So I read your book.

00:15.048 --> 00:16.650
Everyone has one book in them.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.452
Almost nobody has two.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.220
Welcome to the end of the world.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.622
Do you remember the first time you saw her?

00:21.622 --> 00:22.990
Like it was yesterday.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.691
Ms. Lockhart,

00:24.691 --> 00:25.759
do you remember seeing
him for the first time?

00:25.759 --> 00:26.760
Turn her over.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.729
- Oh, my God.
- Hit her hard!

00:28.729 --> 00:30.664
I remember he was holding his daughter.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.098
Do something!

00:32.098 --> 00:33.133
You saved her life.

00:33.133 --> 00:34.535
I'm Noah, by the way.

00:34.535 --> 00:37.304
Helen and I are trying to
raise decent human beings.

00:37.304 --> 00:39.740
Not just get more, spend more.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.175
As you accept our money for
private school tuition...

00:42.175 --> 00:44.978
Mom, stop trying to pick
a fight with my husband.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.346
This is Harry, my agent.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.514
So Bruce tells me that you're

00:47.514 --> 00:49.349
working on something new this summer?

00:49.349 --> 00:51.385
Uh, well, I haven't really
gotten too far with it.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.554
Excuse me, sir, you ordered a whiskey.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.022
Is she flirting with you?

00:55.022 --> 00:56.690
You wanna get out of here?

00:56.690 --> 00:58.292
There's this hypothesis
in theoretical physics.

00:58.292 --> 01:01.028
Your true life continues as is, unchanged,

01:01.028 --> 01:03.163
but at the moment of
decision, a new life splits off

01:03.163 --> 01:04.998
into a parallel universe.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.034
How is any of this
relevant to what happened?

01:07.034 --> 01:08.602
Trying to figure out if
anyone might have had a motive

01:08.602 --> 01:09.570
to kill this fella.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.470
I thought it was an accident.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.738
Uncle Max!

01:11.738 --> 01:13.373
I didn't know you invited Max.

01:13.373 --> 01:14.508
Helen the felon.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.642
- Hello.
- Come here.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.177
Mom!

01:17.177 --> 01:18.445
It's extraordinary.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.681
I want it in stores by next fall.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.382
I don't want this life.

01:22.382 --> 01:24.184
I have to leave.

01:24.184 --> 01:25.485
I'm in love with someone else.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.020
I'm looking for Mr. Solloway.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.322
Is he home? You're under arrest.

01:28.322 --> 01:30.157
I'll get you out of this, I promise.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.224
Mr. Solloway, you have
the right to remain silent.

01:31.224 --> 01:33.160

_

03:32.345 --> 03:34.247
Oh.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.617
Fuck.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.286
What the fuck?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.291
Oh, shit.

05:18.251 --> 05:20.453
I thought you said that
you were considering it.

05:20.453 --> 05:21.988
I did.

05:21.988 --> 05:23.757
I thought long and hard about it.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.526
It just...

05:26.526 --> 05:30.197
I don't know, it just didn't
feel right to me anymore.

05:30.197 --> 05:32.299
And so you wanna go
with this ending instead?

05:32.299 --> 05:34.467
I think it's really powerful.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.136
Well, what can I tell you?

05:36.136 --> 05:37.103
I don't agree.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.705
Oh, come on, Harry.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.307
It's much subtler.

05:40.307 --> 05:42.342
It's two people sitting down to dinner.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344
Yeah, with an unimaginable
secret between them.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.080
Doesn't have the punch of your first idea.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.115
Murder, it's... it's...

05:49.115 --> 05:50.350
it's salacious.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.551
It's... it's cheap. It...

05:51.551 --> 05:53.753
Well, it doesn't have to be.

05:53.753 --> 05:57.324
Have you read Of Mice and Men?

05:57.324 --> 05:58.658
Is that a rhetorical question?

05:58.658 --> 06:00.427
Well, you may want to review it.

06:00.427 --> 06:03.096
The murder at the end of
that book felt surprising

06:03.096 --> 06:04.464
while it was happening

06:04.464 --> 06:08.335
and completely inevitable in retrospect.

06:08.335 --> 06:12.272
Like all great endings in literature.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.007
So what are you saying,

06:14.007 --> 06:16.710
you won't publish it if
I don't change the ending?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.545
I'm not saying that.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.447
'Cause, you know, as generous
as that advance you got me was,

06:20.447 --> 06:22.249
I still only got a fifth of it.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.517
That's because that's how advances work.

06:24.517 --> 06:27.721
You'll get the next part when
you submit the final draft.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.190
This is the final draft.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.094
Maybe you should take
another pass at the end.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.629
No, just one more pass.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.397
Oh, God.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.134
Okay, maybe I should be more articulate

06:41.134 --> 06:43.670
about what I did appreciate in this draft.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.505
I thought bringing the feud

06:45.505 --> 06:48.008
to the foreground of the earlier chapters

06:48.008 --> 06:49.376
worked beautifully.

06:49.376 --> 06:52.512
There's something almost epic in the way

06:52.512 --> 06:54.014
that you now depict that
family, those four brothers...

06:54.014 --> 06:55.548
"Almost"?

06:55.548 --> 06:57.384
It's got a real East of Eden feel to me.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.052
What is it with you and Steinbeck today?

06:59.052 --> 07:03.256
And I love the way that
you introduced Lana.

07:03.256 --> 07:04.724
And I gotta ask, how much of this is

07:04.724 --> 07:08.295
based on what happened between you and, um,

07:08.295 --> 07:09.696
what's her actual name?

07:09.696 --> 07:12.666
It's fiction, Harry.

07:12.666 --> 07:16.269
All right. All right.

07:17.704 --> 07:21.207
I know this is frustrating for you,

07:21.207 --> 07:23.243
but you're in the final stretch, buddy.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.512
Don't go soft on me, okay?

07:25.512 --> 07:27.614
You have something very powerful to say.

07:27.614 --> 07:31.284
I just want you to say it.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.067
- Noah!
- Hey, Jordy.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.702
- How's it going?
- Man, it's been forever.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.136
Where you been?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.105
Uh, I... I've been upstate,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.307
in a little... just a writer's retreat.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.242
Working on something new or...

07:56.242 --> 07:57.544
- That's right, yeah.
- I can't wait to read it.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.179
You know, I feel terrible

07:59.179 --> 08:00.313
we haven't seen more
of you guys this summer.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.748
We've been meaning to have you over.

08:01.748 --> 08:03.183
It's just with the end of the school year,

08:03.183 --> 08:04.317
you know how it is.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.752
Everything's so out of control.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.187
And Becca's mother is
staying with us right now,

08:07.187 --> 08:08.588
which makes me wanna...

08:08.588 --> 08:10.523
What are you doing tonight?

08:10.523 --> 08:12.559
Um, I... Oh, I...

08:12.559 --> 08:13.994
No, fuck, I can't tonight.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.428
- Daddy.
- Duck.

08:15.428 --> 08:16.696
I said "duck."

08:16.696 --> 08:18.231
Uh, listen, as soon as I get home,

08:18.231 --> 08:19.766
I'm gonna check the Google Calendar

08:19.766 --> 08:21.334
and have Becca call Helen and make a date.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.436
- How's that sound?
- Great.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.704
It's great to see you, man. You look good.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.373
You too.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.627
Hey, I'm Noah Solloway. Sorry I'm late.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.063
No problem, dude. We're ready to go.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.432
How much stuff you got?

08:54.467 --> 08:56.603
You know what, this is a
kind of sensitive situation.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.472
You just wait here.
I'll bring the stuff out.

08:59.472 --> 09:00.640
All of it?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.643
Yeah, yeah. I think I can manage.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.578
All right, man. Whatever works.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.234
Where's Helen?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.036
She's not here.

09:30.036 --> 09:32.005
Where did she go?

09:32.005 --> 09:35.108
That's none of your business.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.342
Okay, I'm here to...

09:36.342 --> 09:38.178
I know why you're here.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.580
That's why I'm here.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.415
Oh.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.118
Can I...

09:45.118 --> 09:47.420
Oh, by all means, come in.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.259
Kids?

09:53.259 --> 09:56.062
I've sent them all away.

09:56.062 --> 09:57.130
You sent them away?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.698
Yes, Noah.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.500
I didn't think it would do them any favors

10:00.500 --> 10:02.969
to be subjected to the
traumatic consequences

10:02.969 --> 10:05.138
of their father's psychosis.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.739
Helen and I have taken the liberty

10:06.739 --> 10:08.241
of putting most of your things

10:08.241 --> 10:10.710
in the basement.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.418
Thanks.

10:33.533 --> 10:35.268
Where's the rest of my stuff, Margaret?

10:35.268 --> 10:36.703
It hasn't been appraised.

10:36.703 --> 10:37.704
What?

10:37.704 --> 10:39.539
Once the divorce is finalized,

10:39.539 --> 10:42.342
we'll have a professional
make an inventory of the house

10:42.342 --> 10:44.444
and determine the value of
the rest of the property,

10:44.444 --> 10:46.613
and then we'll ship you
whatever you're owed,

10:46.613 --> 10:49.449
or Helen can just write a check.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.151
Since, let's just be honest,

10:51.151 --> 10:53.586
what you really need is money, isn't it?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.599
Is this all your stuff?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.137
No, it's not.

11:15.441 --> 11:17.410
What do you think you're doing?

11:17.410 --> 11:20.079
These books are mine. I'm taking them.

11:20.079 --> 11:21.748
Not until their value has been determined.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.483
They're paperbacks!

11:23.483 --> 11:26.052
They might have sentimental value to Helen.

11:26.052 --> 11:27.487
Put that back! That's Le Creuset!

11:27.487 --> 11:29.622
Noah, I'm not gonna ask you again.

11:29.622 --> 11:31.291
Margaret, be reasonable.

11:31.291 --> 11:33.092
These mugs are chipped.
This pot is stained.

11:33.092 --> 11:36.095
I don't care if they have
holes in the goddamn bottom!

11:36.095 --> 11:37.630
Noah, get back here!

11:37.630 --> 11:39.599
Who do you think you are?

11:39.599 --> 11:43.269
This is my daughter's
house! This is her property!

11:43.269 --> 11:44.971
And the fact that you had the audacity

11:44.971 --> 11:46.439
to come and show your face here

11:46.439 --> 11:48.174
after what you've done to my family...

11:48.174 --> 11:50.677
Absolutely not! It has to be appraised!

11:50.677 --> 11:52.512
I swear, if you don't
stop what you're doing,

11:52.512 --> 11:54.113
I'm gonna call the police.

11:54.113 --> 11:56.115
Margaret, my father painted
this fucking painting.

11:56.115 --> 11:57.350
Now if you don't get out of my way,

11:57.350 --> 11:58.618
I swear to God I'll push you down

11:58.618 --> 12:00.186
the fucking flight of stairs behind you,

12:00.186 --> 12:02.288
and I'll tell the coroner
it was a fucking accident!

12:02.288 --> 12:04.524
Dad?

12:06.459 --> 12:09.329
Hey, buddy.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.531
I thought you weren't here.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.968
Oops.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.641
Can I come in?

12:29.515 --> 12:31.284
How you doing?

12:31.284 --> 12:34.454
Stomachache.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.189
What kind of stomachache?

12:36.189 --> 12:38.691
The kind that hurts.

12:38.691 --> 12:41.227
Think you're getting sick?

12:41.227 --> 12:44.063
I'll be fine, Dad. Just leave me alone.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.670
Well, I hope you get better soon.

12:50.670 --> 12:53.172
I got tickets for the Yankees tomorrow.

12:53.172 --> 12:55.975
Spend the whole day together.

12:55.975 --> 12:59.279
Talk about what's been going
on between your mom and me,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.713
just the two of us.

13:00.713 --> 13:01.748
I can't go.

13:01.748 --> 13:04.284
What do you mean you can't go?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.386
I have a psychologist appointment.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.055
You have what?

13:09.055 --> 13:11.057
Grandma made it for me.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.562
He's the best adolescent
psychologist in the city.

13:16.562 --> 13:18.331
I had to use every bit of influence I had

13:18.331 --> 13:20.066
to make this appointment.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.668
Noah, your son hasn't been
out of his room in a month.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.536
I watched him play basketball last week!

13:23.536 --> 13:25.371
We are all incredibly worried about him.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.707
His stomachaches seem to be getting worse,

13:27.707 --> 13:30.310
especially when you come around.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.580
Margaret, I gotta ask you,

13:34.580 --> 13:37.050
how the fuck do you face yourself

13:37.050 --> 13:39.319
in the mirror each morning?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.220
How the fuck do you?

13:45.625 --> 13:47.193
Listen, I can't be there to meet you.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.028
I gotta take care of something in the city,

13:49.028 --> 13:51.497
but, uh, just leave it all
on the deck outside, okay?

13:51.497 --> 13:54.233
Absolutely, man. You're the boss.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.506
Here you go.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.217
Dad?

14:11.217 --> 14:15.188
- Hi, Dad!
- Trevor, hey!

14:15.188 --> 14:17.990
Where have you been? I
thought you were at camp.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.726
I hate camp. It's too sporty.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.627
But it's theater camp, isn't it?

14:21.627 --> 14:23.996
Yeah, but it's outdoors in the park,

14:23.996 --> 14:25.998
and they want to do all
these movement games.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.234
And, like, three kids
have already gotten ticks.

14:28.234 --> 14:29.602
Did you run away?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.137
It's fine. I left a note.

14:31.137 --> 14:32.705
Let's go to the movies.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.474
Come on, Trevor, Trevor,
we have to go back to camp.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.109
But why? Why can't we hang out?

14:36.109 --> 14:38.378
I can't. I'm on my way to an appointment.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.313
What kind of appointment?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.382
I'm meeting... meeting with your mom.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.183
I knew you'd work it out. I knew it.

14:44.183 --> 14:45.651
Whitney said you were getting divorced,

14:45.651 --> 14:48.654
but I told her no, that was ridiculous.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.393
Okay, let's... let's, um...

14:53.393 --> 14:55.261
just sit down on the stoop
for a minute, come here.

14:55.261 --> 14:57.163
Why?

14:57.163 --> 14:59.599
Just... just sit down.

15:01.267 --> 15:02.668
So what has... what has Mom said

15:02.668 --> 15:04.570
about what's happening between her and me?

15:04.570 --> 15:08.374
She said you're having a midlife crisis.

15:08.374 --> 15:09.675
She did?

15:09.675 --> 15:11.210
Yeah, and she said you need some time

15:11.210 --> 15:12.979
to get your head out of your ass,

15:12.979 --> 15:15.415
and then you'll be back
and everything will be fine.

15:17.683 --> 15:19.419
Okay, listen, little man.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.754
Listen to me.

15:21.754 --> 15:25.158
I have to tell you something,
and it's gonna suck, okay?

15:25.158 --> 15:28.027
Your mom and I, we are getting a divorce.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.563
No.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.031
Yeah.

15:34.734 --> 15:37.136
I'm sorry.

15:37.136 --> 15:38.337
I'm sorry, buddy.

15:38.337 --> 15:40.473
I know that's not what you wanna hear.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.109
Why?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.411
It's... it's very complicated.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.679
What did Mom do?

15:46.679 --> 15:48.414
She didn't do anything.

15:48.414 --> 15:50.016
Then why are you divorcing her?

15:50.016 --> 15:53.553
Because we don't get along so well anymore,

15:53.553 --> 15:57.623
and because I...

15:57.623 --> 16:01.627
I fell in love with somebody else.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.229
How?

16:05.598 --> 16:08.034
I don't know exactly. I just did.

16:10.403 --> 16:13.306
But you're married to Mom.

16:13.306 --> 16:16.309
Look, sometimes...

16:16.309 --> 16:18.077
sometimes you can fall
in love with somebody

16:18.077 --> 16:20.179
you're not married to.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.715
And sometimes the way you love
the person you are married to,

16:22.715 --> 16:26.686
it can... it can change.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.521
Can the way you love
your children change too?

16:28.521 --> 16:30.590
No, no, not at all.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.459
That always stays exactly the same.

16:36.128 --> 16:37.997
Look, I know this doesn't
make a lot of sense to you now,

16:37.997 --> 16:40.333
but I promise you one
day you'll understand.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.236
I promise, okay? And
it's not gonna be so bad.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.604
I'm gonna get a new place,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.239
and you're gonna have your own room.

16:46.239 --> 16:47.340
I don't want a new room!

16:47.340 --> 16:49.242
Trevor... Oh, fuck!

16:49.242 --> 16:51.744
Ow. Trevor, come...

16:51.744 --> 16:55.214
Trevor, come back!

16:55.214 --> 16:57.483
Ow!

16:57.483 --> 16:59.151
Oh, shit.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.022
Ow.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.760
Oh, fuck.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.967
Hi, sorry I'm late.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.202
What happened?

17:16.202 --> 17:17.303
Oh, it's nothing.

17:17.303 --> 17:18.471
Don't worry about it.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.071
Who's worried?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.308
Mr. Solloway. Jeremy.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.377
Welcome. Have a seat.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.118
Are you okay?

17:33.519 --> 17:35.488
I'm fine.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.690
So since we're already short on time,

17:37.690 --> 17:39.325
let's dive right in.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.360
I'll start with the obvious question.

17:41.360 --> 17:44.997
Have either of you been through
the mediation process before?

17:44.997 --> 17:48.034
And this is your first
divorce, both of you?

17:48.034 --> 17:50.269
- Yes.
- Ah, excellent.

17:50.269 --> 17:53.105
Rookies. I love rookies.

17:53.105 --> 17:55.207
Uh, I understand

17:55.207 --> 17:58.177
what a difficult time this
must be for both of you,

17:58.177 --> 18:00.379
so I will start by trying to
make you feel a little better.

18:00.379 --> 18:04.250
You have already done
yourselves a tremendous service.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.552
You have chosen to divorce
in what I like to call

18:06.552 --> 18:08.120
a humane way.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.156
You're not shooting your
marriage in the head.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.991
You're not running it over with a car.

18:11.991 --> 18:13.993
You're not dousing it with gasoline

18:13.993 --> 18:15.995
and lighting it on fire.

18:15.995 --> 18:19.995
You're just putting it humanely to sleep.

18:20.032 --> 18:23.269
So just take a moment and
congratulate yourselves

18:23.269 --> 18:26.005
on, uh, on this choice.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.980
Congratulations, Noah.

18:33.980 --> 18:37.383
Great.

18:37.383 --> 18:39.085
Great.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.121
So let me tell you how I can help.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.124
You're both gonna tell
me the issues on the table

18:45.124 --> 18:47.426
that are important to each
of you in this process.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.228
And once we've got our list,

18:49.228 --> 18:51.197
we'll talk about the alternatives

18:51.197 --> 18:53.366
until we find a solution
that we all can agree on.

18:53.366 --> 18:56.469
Then I'll write up a sort
of contract in legalese,

18:56.469 --> 18:58.204
which is when I'll get to put

18:58.204 --> 18:59.505
my three years of law
school to a modicum of use.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.475
I'll present you with the papers.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.677
You'll both sign, and,
voila, you're divorced.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.012
Easy-peasy.

19:06.012 --> 19:09.982
So I see you own a house together.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.150
Is that right?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.152
Not exactly.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.487
It's mine.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.589
Did the purchase precede the marriage?

19:16.589 --> 19:18.457
No.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.493
Then the house is considered
joint property, Mrs. Solloway,

19:20.493 --> 19:22.061
even though it may be in your name.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.562
It was purchased through my trust,

19:23.562 --> 19:25.464
so... it's mine.

19:25.464 --> 19:27.466
Ah, I see. That's a horse
of a different color.

19:27.466 --> 19:30.236
And were you aware of this
situation, Mr. Solloway?

19:30.236 --> 19:31.470
Yeah, yeah, I was. It's fine.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.172
Great.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.740
So house is going to Helen. What's next?

19:34.740 --> 19:36.042
My store.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.677
Keep it.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.645
Are you sure, Mr. Solloway?

19:39.645 --> 19:41.714
'Cause under New York law,

19:41.714 --> 19:44.350
any proceeds from any businesses

19:44.350 --> 19:46.252
can be divisible for a period of...

19:46.252 --> 19:49.221
Yeah, I'm sure. It's her store.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.557
Look, all I want is
joint custody of the kids.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.726
I want us to agree on a
schedule of clear visitations,

19:53.726 --> 19:55.761
and I want it in writing
so that it can't be changed.

19:55.761 --> 19:56.996
You sound upset.

19:56.996 --> 19:59.365
A little, Helen, yeah.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.600
I told you I had tickets behind home plate

20:01.600 --> 20:03.335
for the game tomorrow.

20:03.335 --> 20:04.970
And then I find out that your mother has...

20:04.970 --> 20:06.605
He doesn't sleep, Noah.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.075
He barely eats.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.210
Well, maybe he's sick. Did
you take him to the doctor?

20:11.210 --> 20:13.245
He's not sick. He's devastated.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.147
He didn't say anything about that to me.

20:15.147 --> 20:16.282
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.017
Maybe he's hiding it from you.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.253
It's not as if you've
been around much lately.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.656
Okay, so...

20:23.656 --> 20:26.525
So far the only issue
on the table is custody,

20:26.525 --> 20:28.127
and that is a big one, believe me.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.161
But before we tackle it,

20:29.161 --> 20:30.496
is there anything else, uh,

20:30.496 --> 20:32.131
you'd like to add to this list?

20:32.131 --> 20:33.399
Anything perhaps from you, Mrs. Solloway?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.101
No, I want nothing from him.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.536
But would you take half of nothing?

20:40.005 --> 20:43.542
It's a... sorry, it's
a little mediation humor.

20:45.144 --> 20:47.379
Not for everyone, right?

20:47.379 --> 20:50.683
But, uh, moving on. What
about you, Mr. Solloway?

20:50.683 --> 20:52.051
Any assets you wish to disclose?

20:52.051 --> 20:53.419
Now would be the time.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.187
I have this book that I'm writing.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.689
Right, now I saw from my notes

20:56.689 --> 20:58.157
that you've been published,

20:58.157 --> 20:59.492
so I imagine you got some sort of advance

20:59.492 --> 21:01.260
on this new book?

21:01.260 --> 21:02.428
- That's right.
- Yeah, that is something

21:02.428 --> 21:03.729
that we definitely should discuss,

21:03.729 --> 21:06.599
as well as any potential profits.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.200
What?

21:10.569 --> 21:13.005
The word "profits" just...
it struck me as funny

21:13.005 --> 21:15.741
for some reason in this context.

21:15.741 --> 21:17.543
In the context of my book?

21:17.543 --> 21:19.145
Yeah.

21:20.412 --> 21:22.148
You're an asshole.

21:24.416 --> 21:28.087
He can keep the profits and the advance.

21:28.087 --> 21:30.689
So am I to understand that we're
taking the book off the table,

21:30.689 --> 21:32.424
- Mrs. Solloway?
- Yes.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.426
Wow.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.528
You two.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.729
I may even make it home today

21:36.729 --> 21:37.630
for a little afternoon delight.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.131
I don't understand

21:39.131 --> 21:40.766
why you're even asking for joint custody

21:40.766 --> 21:42.301
when you live in a shack in the woods.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.502
It's a cabin. It's not a shack.

21:43.502 --> 21:45.004
Where are the children going to sleep?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.172
As soon as my book is finished,

21:46.172 --> 21:47.606
I'll get the rest of my advance,

21:47.606 --> 21:49.175
and then I'll rent an apartment in the city

21:49.175 --> 21:50.176
that's big enough for all of us.

21:50.176 --> 21:52.244
Really? A four-bedroom apartment?

21:52.244 --> 21:54.079
Well, the boys can share a room if...

21:54.079 --> 21:55.581
With your advance?

21:55.581 --> 21:57.683
Where in the city are you looking,

21:57.683 --> 21:59.752
Coney Island?

21:59.752 --> 22:02.421
It's $400,000, Helen.

22:02.421 --> 22:04.256
Okay?

22:04.256 --> 22:06.625
You think that's enough to
afford something suitable?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.335
Wow.

22:18.737 --> 22:21.173
Good for you.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.075
Are you sure you don't want
to reconsider your claim

22:23.075 --> 22:24.743
on Mr. Solloway's book?

22:24.743 --> 22:27.112
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

22:27.112 --> 22:30.683
So, Mr. Solloway, your plan
is to move back to the city

22:30.683 --> 22:32.218
in the near future?

22:32.218 --> 22:33.352
That's right.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.587
And just so I understand this,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.422
where are you living at this moment?

22:36.422 --> 22:38.591
In a guesthouse on an estate

22:38.591 --> 22:41.126
in Cold Spring, New York.

22:41.126 --> 22:43.596
Living alone. Guesthouse.

22:43.596 --> 22:45.531
Cold Spring.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.666
But as soon as you finish your novel,

22:47.666 --> 22:50.202
you're reasonably certain you can provide

22:50.202 --> 22:51.971
a comfortable living
arrangement for your children

22:51.971 --> 22:53.439
in close proximity to their home?

22:53.439 --> 22:55.474
I'm sorry, how many children do you have?

22:55.474 --> 22:56.642
Four.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.444
Four!

22:58.444 --> 23:00.446
Damn.

23:00.446 --> 23:03.515
You don't get a lot of couples
through here with four children.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.554
Where did you find that guy?

23:08.554 --> 23:11.090
He's very highly recommended.

23:11.090 --> 23:14.159
He did the Jonathan Safran
Foer, Nicole Krauss divorce,

23:14.159 --> 23:16.295
and now they live in adjacent
brownstones in Brooklyn.

23:16.295 --> 23:18.197
But if you don't like him,
we can find somebody else.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.265
Do you like him?

23:19.265 --> 23:20.532
I honestly don't care.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.201
I just...

23:22.201 --> 23:25.371
I want this to be as fast
and painless as possible.

23:25.371 --> 23:27.506
Okay, well, yeah, I want that too.

23:27.506 --> 23:29.341
Well, then let's just go back.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.010
I mean, the sooner we figure this out,

23:31.010 --> 23:33.646
the sooner we move on
with our lives, right?

23:36.115 --> 23:38.417
Whitney won't answer my calls.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.319
Well, she's pissed at you.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.489
Yeah, well, I can't fix that
unless she talks to me about it.

23:43.489 --> 23:46.292
Will you ask her to call me?

23:46.292 --> 23:47.359
Sure.

23:51.697 --> 23:53.565
Are you still seeing her?

23:57.369 --> 23:59.371
I don't want her anywhere near my kids.

23:59.371 --> 24:00.706
Let's talk about this next session.

24:00.706 --> 24:02.274
That's all I'm asking for, Noah.

24:02.274 --> 24:04.476
It's the only thing I want.

24:04.476 --> 24:08.414
Well, you might not get to
have everything you want, Helen.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.550
You're so selfish.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.554
How did I not see that all these years?

25:10.676 --> 25:12.344
How was your day?

25:19.618 --> 25:21.620
Awful.

25:23.188 --> 25:26.759
You wanna tell me about it?

25:26.759 --> 25:28.761
No.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.736
How was your day?

25:37.736 --> 25:40.139
It was good.

25:42.074 --> 25:44.009
What did you do?

25:44.009 --> 25:45.711
I walked to town.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.313
How was it?

25:48.313 --> 25:49.982
It's cute.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.451
I like it.

25:52.451 --> 25:53.619
Hmm.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.454
So you're happy here?

25:57.756 --> 26:01.026
Yeah, I am.

26:02.628 --> 26:03.595
Are you?

26:03.595 --> 26:06.065
Fuck yeah.

26:25.451 --> 26:27.719
Come here.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.688
What?

26:29.688 --> 26:32.558
Let's dance.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.294
There's no music.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.596
There is music.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.531
Come on.

26:39.531 --> 26:41.467

29:07.045 --> 29:09.514
So I added two creams and two sugars.

29:09.514 --> 29:10.983
- Great.
- Trust me.

29:10.983 --> 29:14.019
It's precinct coffee. It needs help.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.121
Can I sit?

29:16.121 --> 29:18.290
Of course.

29:21.693 --> 29:24.429
So I'm worried about your bail hearing.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.631
Why?

29:25.631 --> 29:29.301
Local judge, local boy. City perp.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.636
Right.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.537
I've known this judge my whole life.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.273
He was born here.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.008
His brothers are all cops.

29:36.008 --> 29:38.510
He was the shining star of the family.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.312
Used to be a real nice guy,

29:40.312 --> 29:42.114
but then his wife was
killed a few years back,

29:42.114 --> 29:43.215
and it turned him hard.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.483
Killed, how?

29:44.483 --> 29:46.551
Hit-and-run.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.990
My advice, take a plea.

29:51.990 --> 29:55.594
You'll probably walk. Clean record.

29:55.594 --> 29:58.463
Heavy fine, but you can pay it.

29:58.463 --> 30:02.267
A year's probation. Maybe two.

30:02.267 --> 30:04.136
They can't prove you were drunk.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.038
Or speeding.

30:06.038 --> 30:08.173
They can't even prove
you actually killed him.

30:08.173 --> 30:10.075
No witnesses.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.579
You confess, make a
plea on what is basically

30:14.579 --> 30:16.048
leaving the scene of the accident...

30:16.048 --> 30:18.717
it'll be like it never happened.

30:18.717 --> 30:22.287
But you go to trial with this judge

30:22.287 --> 30:24.723
in this political climate...

30:24.723 --> 30:27.259
I know for a fact Albany's
been getting calls.

30:27.259 --> 30:30.028
They're trying to increase
the minimum sentence

30:30.028 --> 30:33.065
from 2 years to 15 for
a fatal hit-and-run.

30:34.199 --> 30:37.002
15 years, Noah.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.737
25 for vehicular homicide

30:38.737 --> 30:42.737
if they can convince
the jury you had motive.

30:43.075 --> 30:45.610
You don't want to risk that, do you, man?

30:45.610 --> 30:49.348
You've got a young baby at home.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.249
You're not crazy.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.623
I want...

30:58.623 --> 31:01.226
a fucking lawyer.

31:04.760 --> 31:08.726
_

32:09.027 --> 32:11.329
Oh, I'm so deep inside
you. I'm filling you up.

32:11.329 --> 32:12.731
- Yeah.
- Can you feel that?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.633
- Can you feel me?
- I can feel you.

32:14.633 --> 32:17.068
I can feel you. You feel so fucking hot.

32:17.068 --> 32:19.070
Oh, you feel so fucking wet.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.072
Feel so fucking good.

32:21.072 --> 32:24.042
Oh, God, your ass is so tight.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.045
I'm squeezing it so hard. Can you feel it?

32:27.045 --> 32:28.447
Yeah, I can feel it.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.081
Oh, my God.

32:30.081 --> 32:32.217
Your tits are so perfect.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.452
Oh, they're so cute.

32:33.452 --> 32:34.719
Oh, God, I'm gonna come.

32:34.719 --> 32:35.687
Here I go.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.598
Oh!

33:00.178 --> 33:02.647
Holy fuck.

33:04.716 --> 33:08.353
I have literally never
enjoyed sex that much

33:08.353 --> 33:10.622
with anyone.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.724
Literally?

33:12.724 --> 33:15.160
Literally.

33:15.160 --> 33:18.630
Oh.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.332
Champagne breakfast?

33:20.332 --> 33:22.200
Oh, no.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.236
My God, my head is killing me.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.338
Yes, hi.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.107
I need a protein scramble,
gluten-free toast,

33:29.107 --> 33:32.210
and two almond milk cappuccinos.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.212
You gotta give up that
dairy. It's gonna kill you.

33:34.212 --> 33:35.580
You want any champagne?

33:35.580 --> 33:37.649
No, just a fruit plate, please.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.351
Oh, and a fruit plate, please.

33:39.351 --> 33:43.588
But hey, listen, make sure
it's assorted fruit, okay?

33:43.588 --> 33:47.158
Yeah, don't you pad it
with honeydew and grapes,

33:47.158 --> 33:48.326
you hear me?

33:48.326 --> 33:49.327
Yeah.

33:49.327 --> 33:50.729
I just bought this hotel.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.732
That's right, Penthouse D.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.668
Like "dog." Thank you.

33:56.668 --> 33:59.070
You know...

33:59.070 --> 34:02.207
hotels have all these tricks to gouge you.

34:03.975 --> 34:07.975
Oh, good morning, city of dreams.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.148
Oh, my God.

34:10.148 --> 34:11.983
Look at this hotel room.

34:11.983 --> 34:13.418
You have to clean it up.

34:13.418 --> 34:14.985
Why? That's what housekeeping's for.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.656
But we destroyed it. It's embarrassing.

34:17.656 --> 34:21.656
You're so adorable, I can't stand it.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.129
Don't worry, we're celebrating.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.598
It's a big deal. They understand.

34:26.598 --> 34:28.400
The Greenpoint Hotel Group,

34:28.400 --> 34:32.237
people have been chasing
this acquisition for years.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.105
We just became a global enterprise.

34:34.105 --> 34:37.742
Our analyst pushed the
price target up 16 points.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.478
- I'm boring, aren't I?
- No.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.246
- Wow, yes, I am.
- No.

34:42.246 --> 34:45.382
- You hate money.
- No, I don't.

34:45.382 --> 34:49.387
You're such a bohemian.
That's what I love about you.

34:49.387 --> 34:53.692
Remember... you remember when
you used to make those, uh,

34:53.692 --> 34:56.360
dream catchers in college?

34:58.563 --> 35:00.498
I still have mine.

35:02.667 --> 35:06.004
What's wrong?

35:06.004 --> 35:07.539
Nothing.

35:07.539 --> 35:08.974
- Did I say something?
- Mm-mm.

35:08.974 --> 35:10.108
- Did I do something?
- Mm-mm.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.142
- You hate almond milk.
- No.

35:11.142 --> 35:12.377
- Yeah, you do.
- No.

35:12.377 --> 35:14.145
- What?
- I just...

35:16.147 --> 35:20.151
I just have to go to this benefit tonight

35:20.151 --> 35:22.420
because my mother just joined the board

35:22.420 --> 35:25.023
of a new dance company.

35:25.023 --> 35:27.058
And Noah was supposed to go with me,

35:27.058 --> 35:28.660
and now I have to go alone,

35:28.660 --> 35:30.729
and I'm dreading it.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.430
So don't go.

35:32.430 --> 35:34.199
I have to.

35:34.199 --> 35:38.036
It's so important to my mother.

35:38.036 --> 35:41.106
- Helen.
- Hmm?

35:41.106 --> 35:43.508
You're too nice.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.648
I know.

38:14.659 --> 38:17.262
How long have you been a mediator?

38:17.262 --> 38:20.064
About ten years.

38:21.232 --> 38:23.668
And you enjoy it?

38:23.668 --> 38:26.971
Not really.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.439
Okay.

38:28.439 --> 38:30.441
Yeah, it's not that much
fun watching couples bicker

38:30.441 --> 38:32.577
about who gets the dog at Christmas,

38:32.577 --> 38:34.979
but it pays the bills,

38:34.979 --> 38:37.482
and being a lawyer sucks, so...

38:44.255 --> 38:46.124
I'm sorry he's late.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.725
It happens.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.728
Probably why you're
getting divorced, right?

38:50.728 --> 38:53.464
Because he's late?

38:53.464 --> 38:56.201
Because he's irresponsible, disrespectful,

38:56.201 --> 38:59.604
and generally unconcerned with
anyone's needs but his own.

38:59.604 --> 39:01.072
No.

39:03.575 --> 39:06.311
We're getting a divorce
because he had an affair.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.646
Yeah, symptom, not disease.

39:08.646 --> 39:11.683
Hey, sorry I'm late.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.084
- Noah.
- Jeremy.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.319
Nice to meet you.

39:14.319 --> 39:16.387
Have a seat.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.527
Since we are already short on time,

39:22.527 --> 39:24.062
let's get started.

39:24.062 --> 39:25.563
I assume you've both done your homework,

39:25.563 --> 39:27.031
so you know how this works.

39:27.031 --> 39:28.633
- Of course.
- Not really.

39:28.633 --> 39:30.668
No.

39:30.668 --> 39:31.970
Oh.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.138
Well, okay.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.140
I'll give you the quick version.

39:36.140 --> 39:38.209
Um, you tell me what you wanna talk about.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.377
Then you talk about that stuff.

39:39.377 --> 39:42.247
I'm here to referee if things get ugly.

39:42.247 --> 39:44.115
Eventually you come to some decisions.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.483
I'll write up a contract,

39:45.483 --> 39:47.018
and we can all move on with our lives.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.119
- Capisce?
- Capisce.

39:48.119 --> 39:49.621
Great.

39:49.621 --> 39:51.055
Who, uh...

39:51.055 --> 39:54.659
Who wants to start?

39:54.659 --> 39:56.327
Helen?

39:58.663 --> 40:00.598
Um...

40:00.598 --> 40:04.068
Okay, uh, no matter what happens here,

40:04.068 --> 40:05.470
I...it's very important to me

40:05.470 --> 40:07.639
that the kids maintain a good relationship

40:07.639 --> 40:09.374
with their father.

40:09.374 --> 40:11.643
I want their lives disrupted
as little as possible.

40:11.643 --> 40:13.678
So I thought that maybe we
could find you a place nearby

40:13.678 --> 40:16.514
and they could stay with you half the time.

40:16.514 --> 40:18.983
I don't see how that's gonna be possible.

40:18.983 --> 40:21.319
A four-bedroom apartment in New York?

40:21.319 --> 40:22.987
I can't afford that.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.389
I...Yeah, I know.

40:24.389 --> 40:26.424
I thought maybe I could help you out.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.426
With what, the negative
income you make at your store?

40:31.696 --> 40:34.032
Well, no.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.466
I thought my parents...

40:35.466 --> 40:36.467
Oh, fuck no.

40:36.467 --> 40:38.269
No, I am done taking fucking money

40:38.269 --> 40:40.271
from your fucking parents, Helen.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.006
How many times do I need to say that

40:42.006 --> 40:43.541
before it gets into your skull?

40:43.541 --> 40:45.276
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm gonna call a time-out.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.011
- Language.
- Why are you being so awful?

40:47.011 --> 40:48.246
I'm sorry, I just...

40:48.246 --> 40:50.548
I have a really busy schedule today.

40:50.548 --> 40:52.750
I have a meeting with my
editor right after this.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.385
- I can't be late.
- Understood, Mr. Solloway.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.654
If you cooperate, this goes quicker.

40:56.654 --> 40:58.756
Do you even want custody of them?

40:58.756 --> 41:00.291
Of course I do.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.026
Then how do you suggest we go about it?

41:02.026 --> 41:04.329
I need time to finish my book,

41:04.329 --> 41:05.997
and then I'll have some more money.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.199
Okay, until then...

41:08.199 --> 41:10.435
- What?
- What?

41:14.105 --> 41:17.041
You're gonna postpone the divorce?

41:17.041 --> 41:18.209
No.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.713
I-I really don't
understand what... what...

41:21.713 --> 41:24.315
I don't understand what he's trying to say.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.383
Mr. Solloway, you want joint custody

41:25.383 --> 41:27.251
- of your children, correct?
- Yes.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.087
Do you have a physical space for
them to live in at the moment?

41:29.087 --> 41:30.455
No, not at the moment.

41:30.455 --> 41:32.123
Well, that is what we
are trying to figure out.

41:32.123 --> 41:33.758
Well, can't we just agree
on joint custody now,

41:33.758 --> 41:35.526
and then I'll figure out the living space

41:35.526 --> 41:37.295
when I have the means?

41:37.295 --> 41:38.730
Uh, we can. It's a little unorthodox,

41:38.730 --> 41:41.199
but if your wife is comfortable with it.

41:41.199 --> 41:43.568
Where are you living?

41:43.568 --> 41:47.138
I'm living in a guesthouse in Cold Spring.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.207
Harry got it for me.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.210
What are you doing there?

41:52.210 --> 41:53.978
Just writing.

41:53.978 --> 41:55.279
All the time.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.351
Are you living with her?

42:04.088 --> 42:06.557
No, Helen, I'm not.

42:14.098 --> 42:15.099
First position, ladies.

42:15.099 --> 42:16.300
Port de bras. Here we go.

42:16.300 --> 42:18.369
Open.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.637
Gorgeous.

42:19.637 --> 42:21.672
And up.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.608
Other side.

42:23.608 --> 42:26.377
Reach through those fingertips.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.679
Rise up on your toes,
and bourrée, bourrée,

42:28.679 --> 42:30.515
bourrée, bourrée, bourrée,
bourrée, bourrée, bourrée.

42:30.515 --> 42:31.983
Plié.

42:31.983 --> 42:34.252
And up.

42:34.252 --> 42:36.754
Let's rise up again, up on your toes.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.222
Bourrée, bourrée, bourrée,
bourrée, bourrée, bourrée...

42:38.222 --> 42:39.991
Anyway, the worst part

42:39.991 --> 42:42.460
is that he did the whole
thing right under her nose,

42:42.460 --> 42:44.562
while they were staying
at her mother's house.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.064
The whole family?

42:46.064 --> 42:47.298
Kids and all.

42:47.298 --> 42:48.599
How did she find out?

42:48.599 --> 42:49.567
He told her.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.102
- No.
- Yes.

42:51.102 --> 42:52.403
He just came home one day and told her

42:52.403 --> 42:53.971
and said, "I'm leaving you."

42:53.971 --> 42:55.106
Oh, my God.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.241
- Oh, I feel sick.
- Right?

42:57.241 --> 42:59.077
I mean, that can happen.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.179
Poor Helen.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.747
You know, they never seemed happy to me.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.148
Yes, they did.

43:04.148 --> 43:05.550
No, I'm telling you.

43:05.550 --> 43:07.151
He always had this dead look in his eyes.

43:11.322 --> 43:12.557
Helen.

43:12.557 --> 43:14.292
You look great.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.027
- Thanks, Sandy.
- Now take places.

43:17.428 --> 43:18.463
Okay, ladies.

43:18.463 --> 43:20.198
Let's take fifth position.

43:20.198 --> 43:22.400
I want three in the front
and three in the back.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.469
You were amazing in there today.

43:24.469 --> 43:25.736
I've been practicing.

43:25.736 --> 43:27.004
I could tell. Are you hungry?

43:27.004 --> 43:28.272
I'm starving.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.574
You wanna go to the diner?

43:29.574 --> 43:30.675
Me too.

43:30.675 --> 43:32.276
Helen.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.277
Oh, I'm just so glad I caught you.

43:33.277 --> 43:34.512
I thought you left already.

43:34.512 --> 43:35.680
Well, actually, we're on our way.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.315
I'm so sorry.

43:37.315 --> 43:38.416
I didn't mean to be gossiping back there.

43:38.416 --> 43:40.218
It's just... I just found out,

43:40.218 --> 43:41.385
and it's such a shock.

43:41.385 --> 43:42.720
It is. Yeah, I know.

43:42.720 --> 43:44.422
- How are you?
- I'm fine, just fine.

43:44.422 --> 43:46.424
Yeah, you're so strong.

43:46.424 --> 43:49.360
I mean, if it were me, I would...

43:49.360 --> 43:50.628
I would be on lithium, is what I would be.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.730
Well, luckily it's not you.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.699
Well, listen, can I just
ask you the tiniest question?

43:54.699 --> 43:56.601
Two seconds, I promise.

43:56.601 --> 44:00.071
Um, Stacey, Carly has
something to tell you, okay?

44:00.071 --> 44:02.440
She's right over there.
Just one second, okay?

44:02.440 --> 44:06.210
- Carly, what did you have...
- Um... did you know?

44:06.210 --> 44:07.211
Excuse me?

44:07.211 --> 44:08.713
Did you know that he was...

44:08.713 --> 44:10.548
I mean, like, were there clues?

44:10.548 --> 44:12.583
You know, like things
maybe you were ignoring

44:12.583 --> 44:14.519
but which, in retrospect,
seem really obvious?

44:14.519 --> 44:16.387
Wow, are you... Why are you asking me this?

44:16.387 --> 44:18.456
I mean, are you worried about Jeff or...

44:18.456 --> 44:20.658
No. Jeff? Please.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.260
I'm the best thing that
ever happened to him.

44:22.260 --> 44:23.728
He knows that. No, I just...

44:23.728 --> 44:25.596
I just have heard that, you know,

44:25.596 --> 44:28.065
like, there's sometimes,
like, a... a sixth sense

44:28.065 --> 44:29.333
that women have.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.736
You know, like a kind of aura?

44:31.736 --> 44:35.039
You know, now that you mention it,

44:35.039 --> 44:36.474
there was a sort of rainbow

44:36.474 --> 44:38.109
shooting out of his dick last summer.

44:38.109 --> 44:40.311
I probably should have
paid more attention to that.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.146
Stacey, honey, let's go.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.215
Nice to see you.

44:44.215 --> 44:45.349
Come on, honey.

44:52.757 --> 44:54.158
Go ahead, honey.

44:58.329 --> 45:00.131
Trevor, what happened?

45:00.131 --> 45:04.168
His father told him
you're getting a divorce.

45:07.538 --> 45:08.472
Sweetheart.

45:08.472 --> 45:11.075
Mom, why did you do it?

45:13.244 --> 45:14.979
I'm really sorry, honey.

45:14.979 --> 45:17.148
- Come here. Okay.
- Hey, Mom.

45:17.148 --> 45:18.382
Mom, I can write my college essay

45:18.382 --> 45:19.650
on anything I want, right?

45:19.650 --> 45:21.319
Yes, I think so. Is that what it says?

45:21.319 --> 45:23.721
Yes, it does. Can you please tell Grandma?

45:23.721 --> 45:25.223
Tell Grandma?

45:25.223 --> 45:26.724
She's supposed to write about an experience

45:26.724 --> 45:28.226
of some significance.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.094
Instead, she wants to write about the time

45:30.094 --> 45:31.362
her father put a gun to her head.

45:31.362 --> 45:32.663
Oh, Whitney.

45:32.663 --> 45:34.498
He didn't put a gun to my head!

45:34.498 --> 45:36.267
Cole did! She knows this!

45:36.267 --> 45:37.969
Okay, it is significant,

45:37.969 --> 45:39.503
because not a lot of other kids

45:39.503 --> 45:41.472
have been through a near-death experience.

45:41.472 --> 45:43.407
I just don't think that...

45:43.407 --> 45:44.976
I simply told her that
if she couldn't think

45:44.976 --> 45:46.477
of anything more
intelligent to write about,

45:46.477 --> 45:48.479
if she found it necessary

45:48.479 --> 45:51.983
to exploit this family's private
shame for her own advantage...

45:51.983 --> 45:53.050
Oh, Mom.

45:53.050 --> 45:54.118
That was fine.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.053
I just wasn't gonna pay for anything

45:56.053 --> 45:58.256
that came of it, educational or otherwise.

45:58.256 --> 46:00.491
I'm sorry, Helen. That's
just the way I feel.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.560
Dinner will be ready in 15 minutes.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.695
Maybe this time Martin can join us.

46:04.695 --> 46:07.431
It's my college essay!

46:07.431 --> 46:10.301
They want me to express myself!

46:10.301 --> 46:12.403
That isn't self-expression!

46:12.403 --> 46:14.205
It's self-indulgence!

46:28.653 --> 46:30.721
Looks good.

46:32.690 --> 46:36.160
How was mediation?

46:36.160 --> 46:38.996
Fine, I think.

46:38.996 --> 46:40.398
Are you ready to give up

46:40.398 --> 46:41.332
this little humanitarian project,

46:41.332 --> 46:42.733
so we can litigate?

46:42.733 --> 46:45.036
I don't think that's going to be necessary.

46:45.036 --> 46:46.203
We were together for 25 years.

46:46.203 --> 46:47.571
We have four kids.

46:47.571 --> 46:49.440
I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out.

46:49.440 --> 46:50.508
Fine. What do I know?

46:50.508 --> 46:53.577
I'm just 70.

46:53.577 --> 46:55.179
What are you doing?

46:55.179 --> 46:56.681
Setting the table.

46:56.681 --> 46:58.516
Helen, the car's coming in half an hour.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.017
I know. Can I just meet you there later?

47:00.017 --> 47:01.085
I just got home.

47:01.085 --> 47:02.420
I want to have dinner with the kids

47:02.420 --> 47:03.654
and put Stacey to bed.

47:03.654 --> 47:06.023
I'll be there before the
cocktails are over, okay?

47:06.023 --> 47:08.192
You won't even miss me.
I promise, I promise.

47:08.192 --> 47:09.493
Fine.

47:09.493 --> 47:10.661
Do what you like.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.730
Thank you.

47:34.752 --> 47:37.521
Yeah, this is basically inedible, isn't it?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.459
Grandma never learned how to cook.

47:41.459 --> 47:42.493
I can count the number of times

47:42.493 --> 47:43.728
she made me dinner on one hand.

47:43.728 --> 47:45.763
Isn't that crazy?

47:50.468 --> 47:52.269
You know, in some cultures,

47:52.269 --> 47:55.206
it's considered rude not
to answer your mother.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.513
Oh, look, it's Justin Bieber!

48:02.513 --> 48:04.382
What? Where?

48:08.119 --> 48:09.754
Come on.

48:46.724 --> 48:49.160
Hi. Hi, can I help you?

48:49.160 --> 48:51.295
Yes, Solloway. Helen Solloway.

48:51.295 --> 48:53.164
Um...

48:53.164 --> 48:55.566
Oh, here we go. Mr. and Mrs. Solloway.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.234
Oh, Mr. Solloway couldn't make it?

48:57.234 --> 48:58.402
No.

48:58.402 --> 49:00.104
Uh, table nine.

49:00.104 --> 49:03.307
Don't have too much fun without him.

49:03.307 --> 49:04.542
Thanks.

49:50.321 --> 49:53.357
Hello, gorgeous.

49:53.357 --> 49:54.358
Hi.

49:54.358 --> 49:55.659
Hey.

49:58.762 --> 50:00.564
- Hi.
- Hi.

50:00.564 --> 50:02.533
No, ma'am, I certainly
wasn't always in this world.

50:02.533 --> 50:05.236
I started out as a
do-gooder. Helen remembers.

50:05.236 --> 50:07.371
In college, all I wanted
was to be a conservationist.

50:07.371 --> 50:09.473
I used to drag Helen

50:09.473 --> 50:11.609
and her boyfriend with
me to the High Sierra

50:11.609 --> 50:13.477
every summer so that I could hug

50:13.477 --> 50:16.347
each and every tree.

50:17.481 --> 50:19.183
She hated it.

50:19.183 --> 50:22.753
This Upper East Side girl
eating gorp in the dark,

50:22.753 --> 50:24.755
sleeping in a tent with two smelly guys.

50:24.755 --> 50:25.990
Can you imagine?

50:27.191 --> 50:28.459
Actually, as I recall,

50:28.459 --> 50:30.494
Noah and I had our own...

50:30.494 --> 50:31.662
Ow.

50:31.662 --> 50:33.364
But when I graduated,

50:33.364 --> 50:35.065
I got a job at a local NGO,

50:35.065 --> 50:38.235
and it became painfully
obvious to me very quickly

50:38.235 --> 50:41.705
that, uh... how shall I say this?

50:41.705 --> 50:43.607
Money makes the world go round.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.345
And so I realized that I
could make more of an impact

50:48.345 --> 50:51.582
if I made a major financial
contribution of my own

50:51.582 --> 50:53.284
as opposed to being chained to a desk...

51:00.991 --> 51:03.060
You know, I always thought

51:03.060 --> 51:05.396
I was gonna plan a
wedding for the two of you

51:05.396 --> 51:06.764
after graduation.

51:06.764 --> 51:08.566
And when you came to me

51:08.566 --> 51:11.235
and told me you'd chosen
Noah, I was shocked!

51:11.235 --> 51:12.570
Mom, stop it.

51:12.570 --> 51:15.139
The three of them were
thick as thieves in college.

51:15.139 --> 51:16.607
You couldn't tell who was dating who.

51:16.607 --> 51:18.175
It kept changing all the time.

51:18.175 --> 51:19.677
Well, that's not true.

51:19.677 --> 51:23.677
Well, it was only true
in my dreams, Mrs. B.

51:24.148 --> 51:27.184
Your daughter was the coolest,

51:27.184 --> 51:29.453
prettiest girl at Williams.

51:29.453 --> 51:31.021
You know, lusting after her

51:31.021 --> 51:32.423
was something of a campus activity.

51:33.691 --> 51:35.693
Built school spirit.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.031
I just can't believe I finally got her.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.102
Anyway, I think I'm gonna double

51:45.102 --> 51:47.037
my donation to the alumni fund this year.

51:48.672 --> 51:50.541
- You know, Max...
- Yeah.

51:50.541 --> 51:52.977
...if you're serious
about buying in Montauk,

51:52.977 --> 51:54.478
let me introduce you to my realtor.

51:54.478 --> 51:56.180
She's the absolute best.

51:56.180 --> 51:58.148
The rest of them out there
are just local crooks.

51:58.148 --> 51:59.683
That would be wonderful, Margaret.

51:59.683 --> 52:02.052
Thank you.

52:06.590 --> 52:08.025
Here you go.

52:10.761 --> 52:12.062
What is that?

52:12.062 --> 52:14.398
It's a pot lozenge.

52:14.398 --> 52:16.634
For later.

52:19.236 --> 52:20.704
Watch your step.

52:20.704 --> 52:23.273
Thank you, darling.

52:23.273 --> 52:25.976
I'm gonna let you
youngsters say good night.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.581
Max, it was fabulous
seeing you there tonight.

52:30.581 --> 52:33.117
You really must think
about getting on our board.

52:33.117 --> 52:36.120
You have exactly the kind of
perspective we're looking for,

52:36.120 --> 52:38.989
and we are desperate
for an influx of youth.

52:38.989 --> 52:41.558
Oh, you flatter me, Margaret. I'm 45.

52:41.558 --> 52:43.761
And I'm 62, Max.

52:43.761 --> 52:46.330
We all have our weaknesses.

52:46.330 --> 52:48.365
See you soon, sweetheart.

52:48.365 --> 52:50.334
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:53.604 --> 52:55.072
62.

52:55.072 --> 52:59.376
So she had you when she was, what, 18?

52:59.376 --> 53:00.444
What do you think?

53:00.444 --> 53:02.579
Oh, right. I'm an idiot.

53:08.552 --> 53:09.753
You should probably get inside

53:09.753 --> 53:12.356
before it starts to pour.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.129
Um...

53:21.532 --> 53:22.766
Thank you.

53:24.601 --> 53:27.004
For being there.

53:29.339 --> 53:32.009
It's my pleasure.

55:08.038 --> 55:09.439
Hello.

55:09.439 --> 55:13.443
Jon Gottlief, counselor to Noah Solloway.

55:15.712 --> 55:17.047
Is this his wife?

55:17.047 --> 55:18.182
Spouses are not allowed back.

55:18.182 --> 55:19.416
No, she's my associate.

55:19.416 --> 55:20.250
Oh.

55:26.623 --> 55:29.493
Noah, stop talking.

55:29.493 --> 55:30.994
Who the fuck are you?

55:30.994 --> 55:33.197
I'm his lawyer. Hi, Jon Gottlief.

55:33.197 --> 55:34.598
Nice to meet you.

55:34.598 --> 55:36.200
I don't know what you two
have been talking about,

55:36.200 --> 55:38.202
but if you even think about admitting

55:38.202 --> 55:40.370
anything he said as evidence,

55:40.370 --> 55:41.572
I will come after your badge.

55:41.572 --> 55:43.207
Excuse me?

55:43.207 --> 55:45.342
Get the fuck out of my precinct.

55:45.342 --> 55:47.110
You have mishandled this
case from the beginning, sir.

55:47.110 --> 55:49.213
The best thing I can say about you

55:49.213 --> 55:51.648
is that you're a victim
of target blindness.

55:51.648 --> 55:54.518
Now, if you will excuse us.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.497
Noah, listen to me.

56:07.497 --> 56:09.766
Your arraignment is in
less than three hours.

56:09.766 --> 56:11.335
We brought you a suit.

56:11.335 --> 56:14.071
Keep your mouth shut.

56:15.672 --> 56:19.109
I...

56:19.109 --> 56:21.144
I can't afford you, Jon.

56:21.144 --> 56:22.379
I'm paying.

56:26.049 --> 56:27.517
We'll meet you at the courthouse,

56:27.517 --> 56:30.120
and we'll take care of bail.

56:40.764 --> 56:43.400
Thank you.
