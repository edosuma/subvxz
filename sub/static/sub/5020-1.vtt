01:26.482 --> 01:28.228
Weiner.

01:30.753 --> 01:32.333
Weiner.

01:34.440 --> 01:36.153
Boobs.

01:38.394 --> 01:40.107
Boobs.

01:44.466 --> 01:46.213
Pussy.

01:49.405 --> 01:51.185
Pussy.

01:58.380 --> 02:00.160
Damn.

02:02.518 --> 02:04.231
Damn.

02:08.023 --> 02:10.070
God damn.

02:12.261 --> 02:14.074
God damn.

02:16.699 --> 02:18.312
Ass.

02:20.169 --> 02:21.882
Ass.

02:22.571 --> 02:24.418
Asshole.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.255
Asshole.

02:30.479 --> 02:32.526
Ass face.

02:34.683 --> 02:36.697
Ass face.

02:39.822 --> 02:42.138
How far do you think we've gone?

02:44.094 --> 02:46.087
50 miles.

02:46.830 --> 02:50.444
I think we're almost to the woods.
Come on.

03:07.649 --> 03:09.796
Don't get rust poisoning.

03:28.637 --> 03:30.595
Come on!

03:31.040 --> 03:33.387
I thought it was an arrowhead.

03:47.256 --> 03:48.725
Bitch.

03:48.825 --> 03:50.160
Bitch.

03:50.260 --> 03:51.895
Shit.

03:51.995 --> 03:54.130
Shit.

03:54.230 --> 03:56.099
Shithead.

03:56.399 --> 03:58.278
Shithead.

03:59.435 --> 04:01.081
Fuck.

04:02.738 --> 04:05.342
Say it. Fuck.

04:06.342 --> 04:08.011
That's the worst cuss.

04:08.111 --> 04:10.213
Actually, my friend,
he's in eighth grade,

04:10.313 --> 04:13.183
he says that it's just
a different language from Russia,

04:13.283 --> 04:15.562
so it's fine to say it.

04:16.552 --> 04:18.053
Oh, look.

04:18.154 --> 04:20.834
- What?
- Snake hole!

04:28.030 --> 04:31.013
I'm gonna leave mine in there
in case they try to escape.

04:31.113 --> 04:33.046
Good idea.

04:45.047 --> 04:47.260
Wanna see a magic trick?

04:50.152 --> 04:53.189
- No way!
- Want some?

04:53.289 --> 04:54.901
Yeah.

04:55.624 --> 04:58.939
- We gotta ration it, though.
- Okay.

05:01.463 --> 05:03.844
Two centimeters each a day.

05:14.343 --> 05:16.746
Wait, why don't you keep it
in your pocket?

05:16.846 --> 05:20.794
Pickpockets. Got my wallet in here, too.

05:36.965 --> 05:38.501
- The creek should be right over...
- Get down!

05:38.601 --> 05:40.236
What?

05:40.336 --> 05:42.482
It's the cops.

05:44.573 --> 05:47.387
We haven't even been gone that long.

06:13.101 --> 06:16.206
- You're right.
- Did they see us?

06:16.306 --> 06:18.485
I don't think so.

06:23.345 --> 06:25.114
We can distract them.

06:25.214 --> 06:28.161
Throw this on the far side
to make a noise.

06:29.117 --> 06:30.370
Oh, crap!

06:30.470 --> 06:32.555
- You hit it!
- Oh, shit!

06:32.655 --> 06:34.624
- Shit!
- I hit a cop car.

06:34.724 --> 06:36.426
Let's go!

06:36.526 --> 06:39.262
Wait, wait, wait!
It has my fingerprints on it.

06:39.362 --> 06:42.966
- Mine, too.
- Okay. Go get it.

06:43.666 --> 06:45.668
No way.

06:45.768 --> 06:47.336
Fine. Chicken.

06:48.571 --> 06:50.183
Wait.

06:52.140 --> 06:55.322
Go that way. It's better camouflage.

07:14.496 --> 07:18.334
- There's no one in there.
- They could be hiding.

07:18.434 --> 07:22.085
My dad says sometimes cops put
empty cop cars nears roads

07:22.185 --> 07:25.408
so that people won't speed
'cause they think they're real cop cars.

07:25.508 --> 07:27.787
But there's no road.

07:28.710 --> 07:30.701
Do you see it?

07:30.801 --> 07:34.895
I don't know. It could be any of them.
Come on. Let's just go.

07:36.618 --> 07:38.765
I dare you to touch it.

07:39.454 --> 07:41.534
The cop car?

07:41.757 --> 07:43.603
No way.

07:45.794 --> 07:48.375
If I do it, you have to do it.

07:54.436 --> 07:56.316
Okay.

07:57.190 --> 08:01.137
- Ready?
- Stay low just in case they're hiding.

08:01.677 --> 08:03.356
Now!

08:18.426 --> 08:20.206
Okay.

08:23.866 --> 08:25.812
Your turn.

08:34.480 --> 08:36.412
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!

08:36.511 --> 08:39.726
Oh, crap, oh, crap, oh, crap!

08:50.959 --> 08:53.240
Come on, come on, come on!

10:05.267 --> 10:07.290
No way!

10:08.904 --> 10:10.917
Quick, get in.

10:15.477 --> 10:17.413
Get in.

10:17.513 --> 10:18.715
Nuh-uh.

10:18.815 --> 10:21.328
- Why?
- Look.

10:23.285 --> 10:25.090
So?

10:48.376 --> 10:50.546
Hit the boosters!

10:50.646 --> 10:52.815
There's a lot of bad guys behind us!

10:52.915 --> 10:54.936
I'll shoot 'em!

11:00.288 --> 11:02.959
- Did you kill 'em?
- No, look out!

11:03.559 --> 11:05.595
You're driving us right off of a cliff!

11:05.695 --> 11:07.684
No!

11:16.738 --> 11:19.942
Where's the siren?
We need to get out of this lava!

11:20.042 --> 11:22.622
Holy shit!

11:26.548 --> 11:28.618
No way.

11:29.118 --> 11:30.997
Which one?

11:33.488 --> 11:35.568
The big one?

11:44.232 --> 11:46.309
It fits.

11:46.902 --> 11:49.149
Do you know how to drive?

11:50.038 --> 11:52.552
Yeah, I know. "Mario Kart."

11:53.508 --> 11:55.304
Yeah, me, too.

12:18.534 --> 12:20.614
- Me first!
- Wait!

12:27.108 --> 12:28.955
Try this one.

12:31.547 --> 12:33.683
Awesome!

12:33.783 --> 12:36.067
Why isn't it going?

12:39.621 --> 12:42.658
It's moving. It's moving!

12:42.758 --> 12:44.660
Quick, get in.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.238
We're gonna get in trouble!

12:47.463 --> 12:50.545
We already ran away. It doesn't matter.

12:50.966 --> 12:53.479
What if someone sees us?

12:59.941 --> 13:02.128
We'll just tell them we're cops.

13:03.979 --> 13:05.664
Good idea.

13:11.386 --> 13:13.861
This is our cop car now.

13:47.757 --> 13:51.928
- Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit!
- Oh, shit, oh, shit!

13:52.028 --> 13:54.263
Oh, shit!

13:54.663 --> 13:56.366
Impossible!

14:06.942 --> 14:08.713
This is our cop car!

14:08.813 --> 14:10.780
This is our cop car!

14:10.880 --> 14:12.949
This is our cop car!

14:13.049 --> 14:16.229
- This is our cop car!
- Cop car!

18:58.512 --> 19:00.680
Oh, shit.

22:01.983 --> 22:03.685
Hello. Hey, hey, hey there.

22:03.785 --> 22:06.522
Hey there, Miranda. Hello, Miranda.

22:06.622 --> 22:08.590
Hey there, Miranda.

22:08.690 --> 22:11.093
Hey. Hello, there.

22:11.193 --> 22:13.529
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Hey there, Miranda. Mitch Kretzer.

22:13.629 --> 22:15.764
<i>Hey there, Sheriff. Everything okay?</i>

22:15.864 --> 22:19.368
- It's been better, I'm afraid.
- <i>Oh, no. What's wrong?</i>

22:19.468 --> 22:23.772
Well, I seem to be having some trouble
with my radio. Not sure what it is.

22:23.872 --> 22:26.642
<i>Is this the one in your patrol car
or the one you got in your truck?</i>

22:26.742 --> 22:27.776
Patrol car.

22:27.876 --> 22:32.681
Some kind of odd interference I'm getting,
maybe a trucker channel cutting through

22:32.781 --> 22:36.952
or those boys out east with their remote
control airplanes. Who knows?

22:37.052 --> 22:41.156
- Anything odd on your end?
- <i>No. No, not that I can think of.</i>

22:41.256 --> 22:44.626
I tried to radio in to y'all ladies.
You didn't hear that?

22:44.726 --> 22:47.795
<i>Oh, no. Must not be coming through.</i>

22:48.134 --> 22:49.998
I see that.

22:50.098 --> 22:53.174
I thought y'all was just giving me
the cold shoulder.

22:53.274 --> 22:55.904
- <i>Never, Sheriff.</i>
- Okay, well...

22:56.004 --> 22:58.941
I'm gonna see if it's a short
in the receiver,

22:59.041 --> 23:01.476
and in the meantime,
if you do need to reach me,

23:01.576 --> 23:03.312
why don't you just go ahead
and call me on my cell?

23:03.412 --> 23:05.848
<i>Are you sure you don't want me
to send Gary down there to have a look?</i>

23:05.948 --> 23:10.285
No. No. I'm gonna see if I can
handle this one by myself.

23:10.385 --> 23:14.156
- <i>All righty.</i>
- Thank you kindly.

23:14.256 --> 23:15.969
Have a good day.

23:50.925 --> 23:52.867
Any games?

23:53.527 --> 23:55.374
<i>Nah.</i>

24:04.305 --> 24:06.185
Now me.

24:08.075 --> 24:10.122
<i>Last car, repeat.</i>

24:10.711 --> 24:12.681
- What should I say?
- Be quiet!

24:12.781 --> 24:14.550
They can't hear unless
I push down the button.

24:14.650 --> 24:16.485
I know.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.087
Say cops are... cops are...

24:19.187 --> 24:21.490
cops drink diarrhea milkshakes.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.593
Cops drink diarrhea milkshakes
and then poop double diarrhea.

24:24.693 --> 24:27.262
- <i>Say "shit."</i>
- Okay.

24:27.362 --> 24:28.997
<i>This is dispatch. Please repeat.</i>

24:29.097 --> 24:32.658
Wait. But they're gonna know
we're not cops.

24:33.968 --> 24:37.172
Yeah, you're right. They probably
know all the cops' voices.

24:47.948 --> 24:49.717
Can I drive?

24:55.790 --> 24:59.695
It keeps going when I take my foot
off this thing. Look.

25:00.595 --> 25:03.765
- Why's it doing that?
- I don't know.

25:03.965 --> 25:06.201
I know. You jump out and run around,

25:06.301 --> 25:09.638
and I'll scoot over and be like,
"Hurry, get in!"

25:09.738 --> 25:12.785
Okay. One, two, three, go!

25:23.851 --> 25:26.011
That was awesome!

26:05.559 --> 26:07.763
There's a lot of stuff back here.

26:07.863 --> 26:10.098
- What do I do?
- What?

26:10.198 --> 26:11.867
Look.

26:12.567 --> 26:15.737
That's a real road. We can go
way faster on the real road.

26:15.837 --> 26:18.217
Should I crash through the gate?

26:19.639 --> 26:21.327
Nah.

26:25.112 --> 26:26.892
I'll get it.

26:35.589 --> 26:37.693
- Shit.
- Did that break it?

26:37.793 --> 26:40.039
It must be titanium.

26:46.066 --> 26:49.271
- Can you open the lock?
- No.

26:49.371 --> 26:52.918
- Try hitting it with the car.
- Okay.

27:03.150 --> 27:04.974
It's working.

27:05.453 --> 27:06.933
A little further.

27:09.186 --> 27:11.715
I'm pushing as hard as I can.

27:12.459 --> 27:15.141
It's working!
Push your foot down all the...

27:23.804 --> 27:26.352
Serious shit!

27:27.441 --> 27:29.254
Oh, shit!

27:42.406 --> 27:46.259
- That was awesome!
- Yeah, that was so awesome.

28:11.919 --> 28:13.822
Let's see how fast we can go.

28:15.036 --> 28:16.258
Yeah, okay.

28:16.358 --> 28:19.938
Okay, get it all the way up to the 100.

28:20.261 --> 28:21.681
How fast am I going now?

28:24.865 --> 28:26.345
Let me try.

28:31.772 --> 28:34.009
It still won't stop.

28:34.109 --> 28:37.531
Oh, I know. Pull on that shifter thingy.

28:41.117 --> 28:44.920
Okay, R means go backwards
and P means stop.

28:45.020 --> 28:46.866
Makes sense.

29:04.521 --> 29:07.901
This is so awesome!

29:11.296 --> 29:13.008
Look out!

29:35.052 --> 29:37.032
Yeah!

31:49.554 --> 31:51.785
Fuck you, Marcie!

33:04.294 --> 33:06.031
Yeah.

33:06.131 --> 33:09.167
Come on, bitch. Get on there.

33:09.267 --> 33:13.338
Get on there. Come on. Come on.

33:13.438 --> 33:15.717
Get on there, bitch.

33:16.607 --> 33:18.520
Get on.

33:28.785 --> 33:30.555
Okay, baby.

33:30.655 --> 33:32.790
Okay, come to Daddy.

33:32.890 --> 33:34.969
Come on, now.

33:36.660 --> 33:38.440
God!

33:40.643 --> 33:42.750
Oh, shit.

33:53.677 --> 33:55.447
Come on, baby.

33:55.547 --> 33:59.044
Come on, get on there. Get...

34:30.840 --> 34:32.661
Got it.

36:59.831 --> 37:01.566
- <i>Dispatch.</i>
- Miranda. Mitch again.

37:01.666 --> 37:03.701
<i>Hey there, Sheriff.
Any luck with that radio?</i>

37:03.801 --> 37:05.691
<i>I'll tell you what,
you haven't missed a thing...</i>

37:05.791 --> 37:08.206
Hey, we got any units
in the Jefferson area?

37:08.306 --> 37:11.709
- <i>Let me check.</i>
- I think I might have a 2-11 in progress.

37:11.809 --> 37:15.523
Suspect on foot
somewhere in the vicinity...

37:16.713 --> 37:19.717
in the vicinity of Widefield Drive
and Imperial.

37:19.817 --> 37:21.886
Can you call that in for me? Code three.

37:22.186 --> 37:24.599
<i>Sorry, Sheriff, I didn't catch
that last part. Widefield and...?</i>

37:24.699 --> 37:28.971
Widefield Drive and Imperial.
Code three.

37:32.312 --> 37:34.641
Roll the window down, sir.

37:34.999 --> 37:37.613
License, registration,
proof of insurance, please.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.052
Is there a problem?

37:48.211 --> 37:51.226
I'm gonna need you to step
out of the car for me, please, sir.

37:57.687 --> 38:00.007
<i>Calling all units.
There's a 2-11 in progress.</i>

38:00.457 --> 38:03.824
<i>Suspect on foot near Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.</i>

38:04.424 --> 38:08.533
Dispatch, this is 55.
I'm 10-95 at Imperial and Cherokee.

38:08.633 --> 38:10.601
I can cover on that.

38:10.701 --> 38:13.115
Just sit tight. I only need
to see your registration.

38:14.271 --> 38:16.484
<i>55, copy.</i>

38:17.941 --> 38:20.511
<i>Proceed to Widefield
and Imperial. Code three.</i>

38:20.611 --> 38:24.092
10-4. Get those tags changed.

39:01.550 --> 39:03.585
How are you doing today, ma'am?

39:04.154 --> 39:08.336
- I'm good. Yourself?
- I'm fine. Kind of slow.

39:10.828 --> 39:15.733
I swear I think I just saw
the craziest thing out there.

39:15.833 --> 39:18.277
Okay, I'll be right back.

39:19.736 --> 39:21.483
Okay.

39:52.069 --> 39:54.207
So you wanna come pick up?

39:55.139 --> 39:56.422
Okay, what would you like?

40:09.085 --> 40:11.568
Okay, enjoy your lunch. Okay, thank you.

40:14.157 --> 40:16.004
Excuse me, Officers?

40:38.949 --> 40:42.754
<i>...more than anyone!
Daniel trusts his own to arrive.</i>

40:42.854 --> 40:46.067
<i>They'll go to everlasting life
or everlasting death.</i>

40:54.265 --> 40:56.834
<i>Mitch, we're starting to get
some radio interference now, too.</i>

40:56.934 --> 40:59.270
Yeah, I'm having a hell
of a time with my radio.

40:59.370 --> 41:01.072
<i>It could be. It's the damnedest thing.</i>

41:01.172 --> 41:03.574
<i>We just got a report
of a stolen sheriff's cruiser.</i>

41:04.317 --> 41:05.877
A what?

41:05.977 --> 41:08.546
<i>Could be what's causing
the interference.</i>

41:08.946 --> 41:11.642
Yeah, but everyone
is accounted for, right?

41:11.742 --> 41:14.817
<i>Of course. It's just this lady
is sure she saw two kids</i>

41:14.917 --> 41:17.788
<i>driving a cruiser out on 110.</i>

41:17.888 --> 41:19.724
Two kids.

41:20.124 --> 41:21.759
How old?

41:21.859 --> 41:24.393
<i>She says under 10.</i>

41:27.398 --> 41:30.434
Under 10. Well...

41:30.934 --> 41:32.503
Miranda, I think we can...

41:32.603 --> 41:34.572
I think we can go ahead
and throw that one in the nut file

41:34.672 --> 41:37.875
- since everyone's accounted for.
- <i>Of course.</i>

41:37.975 --> 41:39.877
But I'll tell you what.

41:39.977 --> 41:44.215
How about we all switch over to channel
seven until we get this sorted out?

41:44.315 --> 41:48.396
<i>Well, we normally keep channel seven
open just in case...</i>

41:52.155 --> 41:54.232
<i>There it is again.</i>

41:55.125 --> 41:57.420
Just for my own peace of mind.

41:57.520 --> 41:59.997
<i>I hear you. I'll switch the rest
of the boys over to seven.</i>

42:00.097 --> 42:04.536
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just... just... just to be safe.

42:05.636 --> 42:07.638
<i>Attention, all units,
10-6 to channel seven.</i>

42:07.738 --> 42:11.775
<i>Attention, all units, please 10-6
to channel seven until further notice.</i>

42:11.875 --> 42:15.980
- <i>Please confirm.</i>
- <i>This is 55 switching to channel seven.</i>

42:16.080 --> 42:18.549
<i>This is 37 switching to channel seven.</i>

42:18.649 --> 42:21.162
<i>45 switching to channel seven.</i>

42:23.454 --> 42:25.022
<i>Please repeat.</i>

42:25.122 --> 42:28.993
<i>This is unit 2-1 switching to seven.</i>

42:29.393 --> 42:31.262
17.

42:31.962 --> 42:35.032
<i>Dispatch, this is 17
switching over to channel seven.</i>

42:35.132 --> 42:38.413
<i>Confirmed. Dispatch
switching over to channel seven.</i>

43:02.226 --> 43:04.706
Hello, ladies.

43:06.530 --> 43:08.499
Hush. Hush.

43:08.599 --> 43:10.601
I said hush!

43:10.701 --> 43:12.747
Hey. Hey.

43:43.399 --> 43:46.370
All right, kids. Fun's over.

43:46.470 --> 43:50.641
I know who you are, and you are
in a whole hell of a lot of trouble.

43:50.741 --> 43:52.987
Do you understand?

43:56.512 --> 44:01.285
It's downright stupid to steal
a police car, but you've done it.

44:01.385 --> 44:03.320
Now, what's done is done.

44:03.420 --> 44:08.225
And what we're looking at
is a felony offense.

44:08.325 --> 44:10.327
A felony offense.

44:10.427 --> 44:14.732
And what that means
is guaranteed jail time.

44:14.832 --> 44:17.001
The only thing that can help you now

44:17.101 --> 44:22.373
is if that car is returned to me
in one piece.

44:22.973 --> 44:24.508
And what that means...

44:24.908 --> 44:28.546
<i>is you still have a chance
to work something out...</i>

44:28.646 --> 44:33.851
<i>if you tell me right now where you are.</i>

44:33.951 --> 44:36.564
<i>Do you understand?</i>

44:59.075 --> 45:01.111
Keep going.

45:01.211 --> 45:03.281
A little further.

45:03.981 --> 45:06.250
Oh, perfect, right there.

45:06.550 --> 45:08.453
On three.

45:09.053 --> 45:10.865
One...

45:12.922 --> 45:14.736
two...

45:15.658 --> 45:17.528
Aim for the vest.

45:17.628 --> 45:19.907
...two and a half...

45:22.065 --> 45:23.868
two and three quarters...

45:23.968 --> 45:25.770
Now!

45:26.470 --> 45:27.705
Shit!

45:28.801 --> 45:31.085
Maybe it's out of bullets.

45:34.510 --> 45:37.023
I think the trigger's stuck.

45:45.121 --> 45:47.533
Where's the little gun?

45:50.761 --> 45:52.673
I don't know.

45:54.798 --> 45:57.999
- I'll got get some more bullets.
- Okay.

46:11.831 --> 46:14.401
What do you think this does?

46:15.671 --> 46:17.487
I don't know.

46:33.709 --> 46:35.572
<i>Once again,</i>

46:35.672 --> 46:39.109
<i>to the two children
who have stolen my vehicle,</i>

46:39.209 --> 46:41.278
<i>this does not have to be
a felony offense.</i>

46:41.378 --> 46:43.647
<i>Heck, it doesn't even have to be
a misdemeanor.</i>

46:44.047 --> 46:46.851
<i>What's important... is that car</i>

46:46.951 --> 46:50.998
<i>gets returned to me immediately.</i>

46:53.239 --> 46:54.819
What?

46:56.025 --> 47:01.098
<i>If you do not know
how to use the radio, it's easy.</i>

47:01.198 --> 47:05.069
<i>You just pick up the mic and you hold down
the little black button and you can talk.</i>

47:05.169 --> 47:07.304
<i>And when you're through,
you let go and I can talk.</i>

47:07.404 --> 47:10.485
And no one else can hear.
This doesn't have to be...

47:12.708 --> 47:15.144
I just want my car back.

47:22.752 --> 47:26.501
- We should get out of here.
- Yeah, I'll go get the stuff.

47:29.158 --> 47:30.861
- No.
- What?

47:30.961 --> 47:33.464
I mean leave the car.

47:33.864 --> 47:36.000
What? Why?

47:36.100 --> 47:38.168
'Cause we're in big trouble.

47:38.268 --> 47:40.604
We're not in trouble.

47:40.704 --> 47:43.440
You're just too scared to drive
fast enough to get away from them.

47:43.540 --> 47:45.009
I drive fast!

47:45.109 --> 47:48.946
You... you don't drive fast. I saw you.
You were only going 35, pussy.

47:49.046 --> 47:51.448
No, I'm not!
I was driving as fast as you.

47:51.548 --> 47:52.983
Grandma's boy! Hey!

47:53.083 --> 47:55.770
- Screw you!
- Don't push me!

47:56.203 --> 47:58.923
I'm gonna leave and you can go to jail
when the cops get here.

47:59.023 --> 48:01.158
I'm not going to jail.

48:01.958 --> 48:03.871
Why not?

48:25.481 --> 48:27.301
Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh!

48:28.751 --> 48:31.722
Please don't kill me.
It wasn't our fault.

48:31.822 --> 48:34.992
I'll do anything. I'll fucking do anything.
I'll... I'll fucking do anything.

48:35.092 --> 48:37.995
Just don't kill me. Don't fucking kill me.
It wasn't... it wasn't our fault.

48:38.095 --> 48:40.731
I told... I told him,
I said, "You're fucking up.

48:40.831 --> 48:43.600
Please. Dude, we gotta do it now."
And he said, "No."

48:43.700 --> 48:46.870
My brother, where's...
where's my brother, you fuck?

48:46.970 --> 48:51.842
You... you fuck. You don't...
you fucked... you killed him.

48:51.942 --> 48:54.211
Don't kill me. Don't kill me.
Don't kill me.

48:54.311 --> 48:56.680
I'll fucking... I'll fucking...

48:57.409 --> 48:59.449
Do it!

48:59.749 --> 49:01.847
Do it!

49:10.326 --> 49:11.614
Are you a bad guy?

49:12.563 --> 49:15.280
I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

49:15.380 --> 49:18.379
I'm a good... I'm a good guy.

49:19.535 --> 49:22.226
- Then why are you tied up?
- No.

49:26.710 --> 49:30.365
Because I...

49:31.881 --> 49:34.954
I need someone to rescue me.

49:35.419 --> 49:37.721
You boys are gonna rescue me, right?

49:39.203 --> 49:40.901
Maybe.

49:44.960 --> 49:47.998
You know who the bad guy is?
The sheriff.

49:48.098 --> 49:51.335
He's a bad, bad guy.

49:51.435 --> 49:52.881
Where is he?

49:58.525 --> 50:02.679
Wait, hey. Hey, don't leave me in here!

50:02.779 --> 50:04.841
Hey!

50:05.181 --> 50:08.153
The fuck? Fuck, don't leave me!

50:09.453 --> 50:11.822
- I think he's a good guy.
- Yeah, me, too.

50:11.922 --> 50:14.402
Okay, let's let him out.

50:22.431 --> 50:26.370
Listen up. We're gonna let you out, but you
gotta promise that you won't tell on us.

50:27.018 --> 50:29.540
Of course. I swear.

50:29.640 --> 50:32.643
You can't tell my grandma
or his mom or any of our teachers.

50:32.743 --> 50:35.612
- Or my stepdad, Chris.
- I won't tell him.

50:35.712 --> 50:38.025
I won't tell a soul.

50:47.836 --> 50:49.137
Fuck.

50:52.762 --> 50:54.298
This one's really tight.

50:54.398 --> 50:57.367
- Yeah.
- I think you need to cut 'em, all right?

50:57.767 --> 50:59.369
- Maybe we can shoot them off.
- No! No, no, no!

50:59.469 --> 51:02.506
No, don't... don't... don't do that.

51:02.606 --> 51:04.007
All right?

51:04.307 --> 51:07.949
Hey, hey, come here. You know what?

51:08.781 --> 51:11.098
I'm looking at you boys. You seem tough.

51:11.198 --> 51:14.385
You probably... you must have a knife,
right? Maybe a pocket knife on you?

51:14.485 --> 51:17.254
I had one, but it got tooken away
from me at school.

51:17.754 --> 51:19.700
How about you? You got a knife?

51:21.190 --> 51:23.918
Well, there must be something sharp
around here. Go on, take a look.

51:24.018 --> 51:27.364
You, take a look. Yeah,
there might be something sharp in here.

51:27.464 --> 51:28.765
Maybe later. We gotta go.

51:28.865 --> 51:34.071
No, no, don't... please. I need you,
I need you. Look, this really hurts.

51:34.171 --> 51:36.756
And if you don't get me out,
I might... I might die.

51:40.409 --> 51:42.166
We can look.

51:42.266 --> 51:44.915
Take a look. You can stay here.

51:45.614 --> 51:47.424
Hey,

51:47.524 --> 51:49.751
y'all best friends?

51:50.086 --> 51:51.632
How old are you?

52:02.498 --> 52:05.802
I'm so glad to see you boys
instead of that sheriff.

52:05.902 --> 52:09.306
He's a really, really bad guy.
Believe me.

52:09.406 --> 52:11.952
- I'm gonna hook you all...
- I found one.

52:16.312 --> 52:19.716
The tweezers and the toothpick
are missing, but it's got the knife part.

52:19.816 --> 52:22.653
That's great, that's great.
Come here, come here.

52:22.753 --> 52:24.698
Get to cutting.

52:27.187 --> 52:30.661
Listen, okay? You can't have
this cop car. It's our cop car.

52:30.761 --> 52:33.363
We found it and we're not going
to let you have it, okay?

52:33.463 --> 52:36.967
Deal. Don't worry, you can have it.

52:37.267 --> 52:41.839
I don't care if I see another cop
car as long as I live. In fact...

52:42.339 --> 52:45.041
I'm gonna give you boys
a whole bunch of money.

52:45.141 --> 52:48.445
You like naked girls?
I'm gonna get you some Playboys.

52:48.845 --> 52:51.692
And some... and some candy.
You like candy?

53:53.142 --> 53:54.888
<i>Hello?</i>

53:56.746 --> 53:58.815
<i>Is there anybody there?</i>

53:59.315 --> 54:00.917
<i>Hello, Mr. Sheriff.</i>

54:01.017 --> 54:04.254
<i>My friend and me have your car.
I'm real sorry.</i>

54:04.354 --> 54:08.225
<i>We don't want... want to get in trouble,
but we don't know how to get back.</i>

54:08.325 --> 54:11.573
<i>We're real scared.
We're out here all alo...</i>

54:14.764 --> 54:17.240
You boys sure had me.

54:18.869 --> 54:21.204
Okay. All right.

54:21.304 --> 54:23.440
All right, nothing to worry about now.

54:23.540 --> 54:27.410
What's important is that
we get you boys home safe.

54:27.510 --> 54:31.214
Now... you didn't touch
anything, did you?

54:31.314 --> 54:35.729
A lot of dangerous equipment in my car.
You didn't open the trunk there, did you?

54:37.219 --> 54:39.589
- <i>No.</i>
- Okay. That's good.

54:39.689 --> 54:41.000
That's... that's good.

54:41.100 --> 54:43.485
Now, this is what I want you to do.
I want you to set yourself in the backseat.

54:43.585 --> 54:46.697
Don't touch anything. Anybody comes by,
you just say help is on the way.

54:46.797 --> 54:49.032
You're doing a real special job
guarding the car for the sheriff.

54:49.132 --> 54:51.101
- Do you understand?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

54:51.201 --> 54:53.414
Okay. All right.

54:54.470 --> 54:56.250
Now...

54:57.073 --> 54:59.276
you say that you don't know
how to get home.

54:59.376 --> 55:00.760
Do you know where you are?

55:00.860 --> 55:03.347
- What street you're on?
- <i>No.</i>

55:03.447 --> 55:05.715
Well, take a look around.
You see any street signs?

55:05.815 --> 55:09.519
- <i>No.</i>
- All right. Okay.

55:09.619 --> 55:13.523
Well... well, the road that you're on,
is it a dirt road?

55:13.623 --> 55:15.125
<i>No.</i>

55:15.225 --> 55:17.160
Good. Good.

55:17.260 --> 55:20.008
Now tell me, is it a hilly road?

55:20.764 --> 55:24.634
Is it a hilly road or is it a flat road?

55:24.734 --> 55:28.271
- <i>Flat.</i>
- Okay. All right.

55:28.371 --> 55:31.508
Now... now take a look around.
You see any houses?

55:31.608 --> 55:34.454
Anything at all
that might help me find you?

55:36.479 --> 55:38.715
<i>I see some windmills.</i>

55:38.815 --> 55:40.484
A windmill.

55:40.584 --> 55:42.223
Well...

55:42.742 --> 55:44.321
that's great.

55:44.421 --> 55:47.424
That's great. You know what?

55:47.524 --> 55:50.037
I think I know where to find you.

55:51.660 --> 55:53.407
What's your name, son?

56:00.168 --> 56:01.505
Harrison.

56:01.605 --> 56:04.443
<i>And your little partner there,
what's his name?</i>

56:06.375 --> 56:08.178
Travis.

56:08.845 --> 56:13.783
<i>You boys did the right thing calling me.
You just sit tight. Help is on the way.</i>

56:13.883 --> 56:16.486
<i>And don't you worry. You are not...</i>

56:16.586 --> 56:19.333
- In.
- <i>...in any kind of trouble.</i>

56:21.324 --> 56:23.793
Stop fidgeting, you little shit!

56:23.893 --> 56:26.566
That gun doesn't even work!

56:30.332 --> 56:32.412
That's right.

56:49.584 --> 56:51.254
Look.

56:51.354 --> 56:53.567
He can't hear us.

56:56.492 --> 56:58.061
What's he doing?

56:58.963 --> 57:01.041
I don't know.

57:09.204 --> 57:11.785
Maybe he's looking
to go to the bathroom.

57:17.078 --> 57:19.368
I hate him.

57:24.686 --> 57:26.823
I think he's trying to hide.

57:26.923 --> 57:29.003
He sucks at hiding.

57:37.132 --> 57:39.513
Why does he need both guns?

57:40.570 --> 57:42.802
He's a gun hog.

57:50.578 --> 57:52.526
Here he comes.

58:21.027 --> 58:23.240
Where are we going?

58:26.381 --> 58:28.476
Are we going home?

59:22.984 --> 59:24.750
Hey!

59:41.757 --> 59:43.834
This sucks.

59:44.393 --> 59:47.131
Yeah, this...

59:48.031 --> 59:50.311
fucking sucks.

01:00:17.926 --> 01:00:19.973
Where'd he go?

01:00:22.364 --> 01:00:24.277
He's hiding.

01:00:31.107 --> 01:00:32.676
He's gonna shoot us.

01:00:38.447 --> 01:00:40.394
Maybe he won't.

01:00:51.927 --> 01:00:53.093
Okay.

01:00:53.193 --> 01:00:57.467
Now, the man that owns this car is gonna
be here real soon. You understand?

01:00:57.567 --> 01:01:01.304
And when he gets here, I need you boys
to do something for me. Okay?

01:01:01.704 --> 01:01:04.073
You can't tell him where I'm hiding.

01:01:04.173 --> 01:01:06.369
He can't even know I'm here.

01:01:06.743 --> 01:01:09.446
- He's gotta think I'm still in the trunk.
- Why?

01:01:09.546 --> 01:01:11.581
Shut up!

01:01:12.081 --> 01:01:15.118
Just do what I said. Just keep quiet.

01:01:15.218 --> 01:01:17.453
Because if you don't,
you know what I'm gonna have to do?

01:01:17.553 --> 01:01:21.457
- Shoot us?
- No, I won't.

01:01:21.557 --> 01:01:24.227
But what I will do is...

01:01:24.727 --> 01:01:27.831
- You... you got a mom and dad?
- My grandma.

01:01:27.931 --> 01:01:30.967
- You got a pet?
- A guinea pig.

01:01:31.467 --> 01:01:34.204
- You?
- Snake and a dog.

01:01:34.604 --> 01:01:38.541
- You live with your mom or dad?
- My mom and my stepdad.

01:01:38.841 --> 01:01:43.179
What I'll do is go by your house.
And first I'll kill your dog.

01:01:43.279 --> 01:01:47.050
I'll take a hammer, hit him in the head
until the hammer's covered in brains.

01:01:47.450 --> 01:01:51.654
And then I'll take that snake of yours
and I'll slit him open top to bottom.

01:01:51.754 --> 01:01:53.040
Then, your mom...

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:56.960
well, she'll probably have heard that
and she'll wonder, "What's going on?"

01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:00.097
And when I see her,
you know what I'll do to her?

01:02:00.997 --> 01:02:04.167
Shoot her in the face.
And your stepdad, too.

01:02:04.267 --> 01:02:07.170
Make both their faces into ground beef.

01:02:07.270 --> 01:02:09.150
And you...

01:02:09.605 --> 01:02:12.842
I'll take that...
what you call it, guinea pig?

01:02:12.942 --> 01:02:15.712
And I'll throw him against the ground
as hard as I can.

01:02:15.812 --> 01:02:17.580
But that probably won't kill him.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:20.963
And so while he's squirming
around down there, down in the dirt,

01:02:21.063 --> 01:02:25.555
I'll stomp him with my boot.
Crush that guinea pig of yours.

01:02:25.655 --> 01:02:27.824
And your grandma...

01:02:27.924 --> 01:02:30.860
I'll slit her throat
with a big ol' knife.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:34.697
And she'll scream for you
to "Come on and help me,"

01:02:34.797 --> 01:02:37.444
but no sound will come out.
And you want to know why?

01:02:39.167 --> 01:02:43.447
'Cause you can't scream
with a slit throat.

01:02:44.623 --> 01:02:46.693
You understand?

01:02:47.643 --> 01:02:49.279
So...

01:02:49.379 --> 01:02:53.747
when the sheriff shows up looking
for his car, what are we gonna do?

01:02:54.817 --> 01:02:56.196
Be quiet.

01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:01.401
Great.

01:03:14.836 --> 01:03:19.119
- You're eating a Slim Jim now?
- No. Look.

01:03:22.978 --> 01:03:25.492
Next time he comes back,
you should shoot him.

01:03:51.773 --> 01:03:53.867
Here he comes.

01:04:04.886 --> 01:04:06.700
Shoot him.

01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:11.438
Shoot him.

01:04:16.264 --> 01:04:18.568
Shoot him.

01:04:23.705 --> 01:04:26.275
Why didn't you shoot him?

01:04:26.575 --> 01:04:28.455
You do it.

01:07:14.142 --> 01:07:16.178
Should we tell?

01:07:16.278 --> 01:07:19.281
What if this guy kills our families?

01:07:19.381 --> 01:07:21.890
He just wants his car back.

01:07:23.018 --> 01:07:24.898
I don't know.

01:07:42.103 --> 01:07:44.424
Fuck! Fuck!

01:07:51.846 --> 01:07:54.483
You boys sure gave me a fright.

01:07:54.583 --> 01:07:56.632
Holy hell!

01:08:02.223 --> 01:08:05.317
What do you say we get you home safe?

01:08:23.845 --> 01:08:26.557
Okay, now you boys answer me, now.

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:29.223
Did you open up the trunk?

01:08:30.652 --> 01:08:32.787
Was there somebody inside the trunk?

01:08:33.372 --> 01:08:36.292
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?

01:08:36.392 --> 01:08:39.175
Did you open the trunk?
Did you open the trunk?

01:08:39.274 --> 01:08:41.607
Did you open the trunk?

01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:45.618
Boy, you answer me now...

01:08:46.046 --> 01:08:50.712
or I will shoot you dead
right through this door.

01:08:51.023 --> 01:08:53.408
Tell me right now...

01:08:53.509 --> 01:08:55.520
where is he?

01:08:59.647 --> 01:09:00.823
Son...

01:09:02.850 --> 01:09:06.322
I am the only person out here
that you can trust.

01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:10.870
I'm the only one that can help you.

01:09:21.868 --> 01:09:23.950
Oh, fuck.

01:09:43.323 --> 01:09:45.371
I knew it!

01:09:46.728 --> 01:09:50.372
You little shits! I knew I wasn't crazy!

01:09:51.434 --> 01:09:54.870
You think you can ride down this highway
and I won't know about it?

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:58.975
I know these roads like the back
of my hand! What's wrong with you?

01:09:59.275 --> 01:10:03.346
Don't think you can play
dumb with me. I saw you.

01:10:03.946 --> 01:10:06.148
You almost ran me off the road.

01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:10.453
You are in so much trouble!

01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:12.621
Get out of the car!

01:10:12.721 --> 01:10:15.658
Hey! I'm talking to you!

01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:18.027
Step outside the car.

01:10:18.327 --> 01:10:20.085
Come on.

01:10:20.185 --> 01:10:23.332
Get out! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:10:23.432 --> 01:10:24.656
- Ma'am.
- Are you okay?

01:10:24.756 --> 01:10:27.217
I'm gonna need you to calm down.
I'm a police officer.

01:10:27.317 --> 01:10:29.667
- Are you bleeding? I'm so...
- Ma'am!

01:10:29.767 --> 01:10:33.376
- What?
- I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

01:10:33.476 --> 01:10:35.311
- All right? All right?
- Okay. Okay.

01:10:35.411 --> 01:10:37.372
- Just nod your head. Just nod.
- Okay.

01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:39.348
- Just nod it at me.
- All right.

01:10:40.285 --> 01:10:42.151
I've been injured by a perpetrator.

01:10:42.251 --> 01:10:45.988
He is the father of the two boys
that are inside this vehicle.

01:10:46.765 --> 01:10:48.224
You are okay.

01:10:48.324 --> 01:10:50.610
He has fled the scene
and everything is okay,

01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:53.066
but I'm gonna need
your help with something.

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:55.999
All right? Now listen up.

01:10:56.349 --> 01:10:58.047
After I was attacked,

01:10:58.147 --> 01:11:01.337
he threw my keys on the other side
of the road, way over there.

01:11:01.437 --> 01:11:03.811
And what I'm gonna need you
to do is go ahead,

01:11:03.911 --> 01:11:07.680
cross the road and see
if you can find my keys for me

01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:12.759
so that I can radio for assistance.
You see, I cannot walk.

01:11:21.906 --> 01:11:23.753
Do you understand?

01:11:26.127 --> 01:11:27.966
Yeah.

01:11:28.666 --> 01:11:31.500
Why don't I just call somebody
to come and get you?

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.970
No. No, no. No need to call.

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:39.119
Just head on over there
and see what you can find.

01:11:40.074 --> 01:11:41.977
Go on.

01:11:42.577 --> 01:11:44.317
- Go on.
- You okay?

01:11:44.417 --> 01:11:46.248
Yeah.

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:48.594
- Go on.
- Okay.

01:11:51.653 --> 01:11:53.933
Just take a good look around there.

01:11:55.357 --> 01:11:59.262
It's gonna be hard to find them out here.
There's so much tumbleweed.

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:01.697
Cover as much ground as you can.

01:12:01.797 --> 01:12:05.312
Yeah, and... just keep
your eyes peeled, okay?

01:12:08.135 --> 01:12:11.284
- Okay?
- Okay!

01:12:21.949 --> 01:12:27.156
Are you the woman that reported
the children driving the cruiser?

01:12:27.656 --> 01:12:29.392
Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

01:12:29.492 --> 01:12:33.929
Everyone said that I seen it wrong,
but I knew I saw them.

01:12:34.029 --> 01:12:36.832
Well, you did a real good thing, ma'am.

01:12:36.932 --> 01:12:38.470
It's... it's...

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:42.715
it's citizens like you that make
a difference in our community.

01:12:44.739 --> 01:12:48.277
- Taking an active role.
- I don't see anything.

01:12:49.177 --> 01:12:51.259
You didn't find anything?

01:12:51.459 --> 01:12:53.490
Nothing at all?

01:13:00.554 --> 01:13:02.535
Keep looking.

01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:07.162
Oh, my God.

01:13:07.262 --> 01:13:09.323
There's a man out there!

01:15:40.515 --> 01:15:43.062
- Help!
- Help!

01:15:45.788 --> 01:15:47.596
Help!

01:16:00.167 --> 01:16:02.749
- Help!
- Help!

01:16:03.949 --> 01:16:06.661
Help!

01:16:21.489 --> 01:16:23.869
What time do you think it is?

01:16:26.394 --> 01:16:28.377
I don't know.

01:16:29.197 --> 01:16:31.664
I gotta go to the bathroom.

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.480
We have to go.

01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:45.435
I think they're dead.

01:16:45.535 --> 01:16:48.560
I was gonna try to shoot out the window.

01:16:56.924 --> 01:16:59.456
Dang it, how do these work?

01:17:00.028 --> 01:17:02.031
Let me try.

01:17:11.505 --> 01:17:14.587
- Come on.
- Try like...

01:17:15.743 --> 01:17:17.624
Try to smash the window with it.

01:17:34.562 --> 01:17:36.575
Let me throw it.

01:17:48.174 --> 01:17:50.557
If this would just...

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.983
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know!

01:17:55.083 --> 01:17:57.363
My ears!

01:18:27.314 --> 01:18:29.195
Wait!

01:18:47.868 --> 01:18:50.316
I think something hit me.

01:18:55.776 --> 01:18:58.570
You should've worn the bulletproof vest.

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.961
I know.

01:19:57.038 --> 01:20:00.593
- Where's the lights?
- It's by the shifter thing.

01:20:05.312 --> 01:20:07.658
It's not working.

01:20:08.283 --> 01:20:11.554
It's okay. It doesn't hurt much anymore.

01:20:22.163 --> 01:20:23.566
<i>Boys.</i>

01:20:28.986 --> 01:20:32.941
<i>Boys, I know you can hear me.</i>

01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:36.155
<i>Slow down, boys. It's all right.</i>

01:20:40.247 --> 01:20:43.396
<i>I just... I just want my car back.</i>

01:20:59.967 --> 01:21:02.014
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:09.211
<i>You don't...</i>

01:21:13.414 --> 01:21:15.125
<i>steal...</i>

01:21:18.619 --> 01:21:20.658
a fuckin'...

01:21:22.123 --> 01:21:24.147
cop car!

01:21:42.009 --> 01:21:44.690
We did it! Travis!

01:21:55.590 --> 01:21:58.211
Take me home quick. Quick.

01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:14.246
<i>Sheriff, you out there?</i>

01:23:16.737 --> 01:23:18.707
<i>Sheriff, can you hear me?</i>

01:23:18.807 --> 01:23:20.675
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:23:20.775 --> 01:23:22.811
<i>This is dispatch.</i>

01:23:23.311 --> 01:23:25.347
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:23:25.947 --> 01:23:28.394
<i>See? There's no one out there.</i>

01:23:29.383 --> 01:23:30.396
