00:00.135 --> 00:02.868
What's up, Wayniacs?
Welcome to "The Marlon Way."

00:02.869 --> 00:05.192
You know what the most
important thing in life is?

00:05.193 --> 00:07.070
A good wingman.

00:07.071 --> 00:09.739
You ain't nothing
without a good wingman.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.574
Take Batman for example.

00:11.575 --> 00:13.076
What's Batman without Robin?

00:13.077 --> 00:14.744
He's just a rich dude in a cave.

00:14.745 --> 00:16.312
But Batman with Robin,

00:16.312 --> 00:20.083
he's a rich dude in a cave
with a boy in tights.

00:20.084 --> 00:24.087
Wait, actually Robin make
the whole thing kinda weird.

00:24.088 --> 00:26.456
You need to keep an eye
on that damn Batman.

00:26.457 --> 00:29.626
Anyway, my point is
if you've got a good wingman,

00:29.627 --> 00:31.861
you'll always succeed in life,

00:31.862 --> 00:35.398
and your boy Marlon
is the best wingman of all.

00:35.399 --> 00:38.134
Hey, Marlon, I have a date.
Can I borrow your cologne?

00:38.135 --> 00:39.969
Hell no! Use the Febreze!

<i>[HIP-HOP MUSIC]</i>

00:52.249 --> 00:55.485
This movie gets
more and more remarkable

00:55.486 --> 00:56.719
every time I see it.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.821
This is the modern day "Citizen Kane."

00:58.822 --> 01:00.757
It puts "Casablanca" to shame.

01:00.758 --> 01:02.358
It's better than "The Godfather."

01:02.359 --> 01:03.660
What are you watching?

01:03.661 --> 01:05.995
BOTH: "Radio."

01:05.996 --> 01:07.230
"Radio?"

01:07.231 --> 01:09.499
With Cuba Gooding Jr. and the teeth?

01:09.500 --> 01:11.334
I hated that movie.

01:11.335 --> 01:14.437
Wow, see this is why
she and I didn't work.

01:14.438 --> 01:17.707
Anybody that don't love "Radio"
don't love themselves.

01:17.708 --> 01:20.243
I say we watch it again.

01:20.244 --> 01:21.432
Ugh.

01:21.433 --> 01:23.713
Listen, this movie was more
important to African Americans

01:23.714 --> 01:26.849
than "Black Panther."

01:26.850 --> 01:30.253
"Radio" was the first black superhero.

01:30.254 --> 01:31.688
No, no.

01:31.689 --> 01:34.891
Mom, they're binge-watching "Radio."

01:34.892 --> 01:37.293
This is child abuse.

01:37.294 --> 01:39.762
If you love us,
you'll send us to bed early.

01:39.763 --> 01:42.198
Okay, go to bed.

01:42.199 --> 01:43.432
Yes!

01:43.538 --> 01:46.569
Guys, you don't get it!
They wasn't teaching Radio.

01:46.570 --> 01:49.739
Radio was teaching them!

01:49.740 --> 01:51.808
Man, that boy got some nerve.

01:51.809 --> 01:53.543
You would think with his math grades,

01:53.544 --> 01:55.912
Radio was his tutor.

01:55.913 --> 01:58.281
Aww, shucks. So how was the club?

01:58.282 --> 02:01.484
How was the Naughty 40 Club, huh?

02:01.485 --> 02:05.221
Eh, you cougars catch a prey? [GROWLS]

02:05.222 --> 02:08.056
No! Yvette is a terrible wingman.

02:08.058 --> 02:09.758
She's supposed to be helping me.

02:09.759 --> 02:12.762
Instead, she spends the whole
night stalking her ex, Reggie,

02:12.763 --> 02:14.130
trying to make him jealous.

02:14.131 --> 02:16.733
Well, Ashley, Reggie and I
had a connection.

02:16.734 --> 02:20.136
He had shows on my DVR.

02:20.137 --> 02:22.672
We talked matching Range Rovers.

02:22.673 --> 02:24.841
Reggie's the one that got away.

02:24.842 --> 02:27.342
How'd he do it? He gnaw his foot off?

02:28.544 --> 02:31.980
Or he dig his way out
with a spoon like "Shawshank"?

02:33.116 --> 02:35.852
So what happened, Ash?
You get some action, huh?

02:35.853 --> 02:37.320
You get a little bump and grind?

02:37.321 --> 02:38.955
You get some of that dun-dun-dun-dun?

02:38.956 --> 02:41.924
Okay. Okay. You know what, Marlon?

02:41.925 --> 02:44.093
What I'm not gonna do
is make a bad night worse

02:44.094 --> 02:46.596
by discussing my romantic life
with my ex-husband.

02:46.597 --> 02:48.965
Why not? Come on,
we can talk about things.

02:48.966 --> 02:49.966
We're friends.

02:49.967 --> 02:52.101
Um, do you not remember

02:52.102 --> 02:54.037
that my first date after our divorce,

02:54.038 --> 02:56.773
you stalked us,
popped out of the bushes,

02:56.774 --> 02:59.042
and said, "Ahh, hell no!

02:59.043 --> 03:01.978
This is what I wanted you to do."

03:01.979 --> 03:03.880
Ah, girl, that's back
when I wanted to hit it.

03:03.881 --> 03:05.615
I'm cool on you now.

03:05.616 --> 03:08.551
Look, Ash, if we gonna be
about this cool divorce life,

03:08.552 --> 03:10.820
then, you know,
we gotta discuss these things.

03:10.821 --> 03:12.989
And by the way,
I've matured since then.

03:12.990 --> 03:14.957
Oh, please, Marlon.

03:14.958 --> 03:17.360
I'm the only one
who can hear all the stories

03:17.361 --> 03:19.962
about you dating crazy chicks
without tripping.

03:19.963 --> 03:21.297
Oh, girl, remember the one

03:21.298 --> 03:22.965
that slept upside-down like a bat?

03:22.966 --> 03:25.835
[LAUGHTER]

03:25.836 --> 03:28.203
Sex with her was a real head rush.

03:29.605 --> 03:32.642
How 'bout the one who had
multiple personalities?

03:32.643 --> 03:35.044
Girl, I had a ménage à trois
with one person.

03:35.045 --> 03:37.713
It was amazing.

03:37.714 --> 03:39.715
My favorite was the one
that said I was a freeloader

03:39.716 --> 03:40.983
living on your couch.

03:40.984 --> 03:43.418
BOTH: Negro, you are!

03:45.922 --> 03:48.157
Yeah, right.

03:48.158 --> 03:50.893
Okay, none of this matters
because I'm not gonna discuss

03:50.894 --> 03:52.361
my romantic life with you.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.230
Ashley, listen,
I'm telling you, I swear,

03:54.231 --> 03:56.532
I've grown, okay? And I can prove it.

03:56.533 --> 03:58.568
I'm gonna be your wingman.

03:58.569 --> 04:00.169
What?

04:00.170 --> 04:02.171
I'm gonna be your wingman.
You said it yourself,

04:02.172 --> 04:03.940
Yvette is a terrible wingman.

04:03.941 --> 04:05.341
Marlon, are you serious?

04:05.342 --> 04:06.909
Yeah, I'm serious,
I'm gonna sit in the cut,

04:06.910 --> 04:08.744
I'm gonna peep your game,
make some tweaks,

04:08.745 --> 04:11.180
and I'm gonna land you a freak.

04:11.181 --> 04:13.683
But I'm not gonna give him
all my secrets.

04:13.684 --> 04:17.252
We ain't gonna be like, "No,
she like it counterclockwise."

04:20.456 --> 04:23.192
Against my better judgment, all right.

04:23.193 --> 04:25.027
I'm in, but listen.

04:25.028 --> 04:26.362
The first time you start tripping

04:26.363 --> 04:28.030
when I'm talking
to a dude, it's a wrap.

04:28.031 --> 04:30.399
- All right, bet.
- Bet.

04:30.400 --> 04:33.069

we all going to Mantra.

in VIP every Saturday

for him to see the dudes

a devilishly handsome man

04:46.150 --> 04:47.884
on your arm will
take your jealousy plot

04:47.885 --> 04:49.552
to the next level.

04:49.553 --> 04:51.487

be jealous if I show up with

being my wingman?

05:07.471 --> 05:09.405

I could be your wingman.

gets kicked out of a nightclub?

18:44.145 --> 18:45.311
[LAUGHS]

18:45.312 --> 18:47.547
Oh, my God, wait till I tell Zack

18:47.548 --> 18:50.784
his mamma is ratchet.

18:50.785 --> 18:53.253
Oh, he gonna be so proud.

18:53.254 --> 18:55.989
Marlon, you do not have to rub it in.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.291
You know, for the first time
in 17 years,

18:58.292 --> 19:00.894
I'm not the crazy one
in this relationship.

19:00.895 --> 19:02.796
[LAUGHS]

19:02.797 --> 19:05.999
Girl, this feels good.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.636
Okay, fine, perhaps
I'm not as mature as I thought.

19:09.637 --> 19:11.070
Perhaps?

19:11.071 --> 19:15.475
Girl, you got over 3 million
views Shade Room.

19:15.476 --> 19:18.244
Con-ratch-ulations.

19:18.245 --> 19:20.013
Ashley, come on, man. What happened?

19:20.014 --> 19:21.748
I mean, you've been cool
with me dating girls

19:21.749 --> 19:23.183
since we split.

19:23.184 --> 19:26.119
Yeah, that's because
they've all been crazy chicks.

19:27.454 --> 19:30.490
You know, when I saw you
vibing with Tanya,

19:30.491 --> 19:32.859
I don't know, it seemed significant.

19:32.860 --> 19:34.994
And for the past 17 years,

19:34.995 --> 19:39.132
I've been the significant
woman in your life.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.034
I got jealous, Marlon, okay?

19:41.035 --> 19:42.702
I'm embarrassed.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.971
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey.

19:44.972 --> 19:46.339
It's okay.

19:46.340 --> 19:50.643
You will always be significant to me.

19:50.644 --> 19:54.314
I mean, look, this whole
thing is new for us, okay?

19:54.315 --> 19:56.883
We're gonna figure it out,
and it's gonna take some time.

19:56.884 --> 20:00.520
And sometimes you gonna go
a little baby mama on 'em.

20:00.521 --> 20:03.056
[BOTH LAUGH]

20:03.057 --> 20:05.725
But you can do that. You know why?

20:05.726 --> 20:07.360
I got you.

20:07.361 --> 20:08.228
Really?

20:08.229 --> 20:09.562
Yes, I got you.

20:09.563 --> 20:12.031
I'm not just your wingman in a club.

20:12.032 --> 20:14.033
I'm your wingman for life.

20:17.137 --> 20:18.705
Wanna beat?
- No.

20:18.706 --> 20:20.139
Okay.

20:20.140 --> 20:23.209
So you gonna see Tanya again?

20:23.210 --> 20:25.011
What do you think?
You told her I'm a squirter.

20:25.012 --> 20:26.379
I don't think so.

20:26.380 --> 20:28.181
[LAUGHS]

20:28.182 --> 20:30.416
You know what,
she's not your type anyway.

20:30.417 --> 20:33.152
Clearly you like crazy chicks
who start fights in clubs

20:33.153 --> 20:36.489
with perfectly pleasant people
that they met at spin class.

20:38.592 --> 20:41.494
Hey, so how'd it go?
Did you make Reggie jealous?

20:41.495 --> 20:44.063
No, I saw on Instagram
he never even made it

20:44.064 --> 20:46.099
to the club tonight,
and I went and kissed

20:46.100 --> 20:48.701
Mr. Cornball on the Cob
here for nothing.

20:51.038 --> 20:52.572
Tonight sucked.

20:52.573 --> 20:55.775
Well, I know something
that'll cheer you up.

20:55.776 --> 20:57.043
Do not say...

20:57.044 --> 20:59.612
BOTH: "Radio!"

20:59.613 --> 21:03.283
Oh, this movie gets
better and better with age.

21:03.284 --> 21:06.719
It's the Angela Bassett of movies.

21:08.307 --> 21:14.472
