00:00.930 --> 00:02.488
Previously on
Pretty Little Liars...

00:02.530 --> 00:04.191
We'll find out
where they're taking him.

00:04.230 --> 00:05.424
and we'll get you there.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.728
The plan was to
get All out of town tonight

00:08.770 --> 00:10.533
but now that we know
that "A's" after Ezra...

00:10.570 --> 00:12.231
I get that "A" wants
to shut Ezra up,

00:12.280 --> 00:13.531
but Ali's still a target.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.377
Exactly what is it
you want us to do?

00:15.410 --> 00:16.638
I want us
to stick together.

00:16.680 --> 00:19.240
The bigger we are,
the harder she falls.

00:19.280 --> 00:19.974
- Oh, my God.
- Look at her!

00:20.020 --> 00:20.839
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.711
I saw Mrs. DiLaurentis
in the woods,

00:22.750 --> 00:23.614
and I tried to follow her.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.584
She was giving a suitcase
to somebody,

00:25.620 --> 00:27.212
and I thought maybe it was Ali.

00:27.260 --> 00:28.386
Jason, what's going on?

00:28.420 --> 00:29.728
I kind of need to
keep a little space

00:29.760 --> 00:30.852
- between me and Spencer.
- Why?

00:30.890 --> 00:33.051
My mom needs me right now,
and I'm here to help her.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.056
- This isn't a game.
- So what is it?

00:35.100 --> 00:36.294
- Justice.
- SPENCER: For who?

00:36.330 --> 00:37.319
Jenna.

00:39.500 --> 00:40.797
- ( door opens
- Spencer! )

00:40.840 --> 00:42.398
- Surprise!
- Hey, Shana!

00:42.440 --> 00:44.431
- ( gunshot)
- ( screaming )

00:46.680 --> 00:48.739
- You did what you had to do.
- Let's go home.

01:00.820 --> 01:03.823
( brakes squeak)

01:09.730 --> 01:10.799
Thanks.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.732
Ali, are you okay?

01:21.210 --> 01:22.404
Stop.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.179
You don't need to run
anymore.

01:24.210 --> 01:26.212
"A" is gone.
Come on.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.150
Ali, look...
we talked about this.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.181
You know
it's the right decision.

01:35.220 --> 01:38.724
Maybe I should go home
first...speak to my mom.

01:38.760 --> 01:43.197
Ali, your mother buried you.

01:43.230 --> 01:45.118
Look, I think it's more
important that

01:45.170 --> 01:47.229
the police know you're alive
before your mom does.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.204
Hey, yeah.
You need to walk in there

01:49.240 --> 01:50.901
and tell them everything.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.703
I mean,
about Mona being "A,"

01:52.740 --> 01:55.334
Shana taking over where
Mona left off--all of it.

01:55.380 --> 01:57.302
Start with the night
that you ran away.

01:57.350 --> 02:00.217
No. Before that you have
to start with the Jenna thing.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.639
- Wait, what? Why?
- She has to.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.511
Shana was after us for payback
for what happened to Jenna.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.711
- I can't do this.
- I can't.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.228
You can. _
Okay, you're not In this alone.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.195
"A" tortured all of us,
and what happened to Shana--

02:13.230 --> 02:14.299
Happened because of me.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.738
And I can handle that part.
I think.

02:19.770 --> 02:22.364
But, Ali, look, you're
gonna have to cover the rest.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.469
Ali.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.145
Are we in agreement?

02:45.390 --> 02:48.291
- ( indistinct conversations )
- ( phone beeping )

02:56.000 --> 02:58.730
- Are you Detective Holbrook?
-Iam.

03:00.410 --> 03:02.401
I think you've been
looking for me.

03:03.810 --> 03:06.847
- I'm--
- I know who you are.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.212
I'm glad you're with your
friends. Welcome home.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.218
I'm guessing you have
a lot to tell me.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.185
Maybe we can begin with the
night that you disappeared.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.459
( zipper closes )

03:18.030 --> 03:19.793
I didn't disappear.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.698
I was kidnapped.

03:23.730 --> 03:27.439
I was kidnapped and held
hostage for two years,

03:27.470 --> 03:29.700
and if it weren't
for my friends,

03:29.740 --> 03:34.200
I wouldn't be standing here.
They saved my life.

03:37.780 --> 03:38.940
* Got a secret

03:38.980 --> 03:40.311
* Can you keep it?

03:40.350 --> 03:42.784
* Swear this one you'll save

03:42.820 --> 03:45.015
* Better lock it,
in your pocket *

03:45.050 --> 03:47.780
* Taking this one to the grave

03:47.820 --> 03:49.959
* If I show you,
then I know you *

03:49.990 --> 03:52.857
* Won't tell what I said

03:52.900 --> 03:55.460
* 'Cause two can
keep a secret *

03:55.500 --> 03:57.468
* If one of them is dead

04:00.370 --> 04:02.634
We don't know who took this
photo, but it is dated,

04:02.670 --> 04:06.299
so I'm assuming this wasn't
your first visit home.

04:06.340 --> 04:08.900
Do you have any memory
of this night?

04:08.940 --> 04:10.840
It was the night that I got
away from him.

04:10.880 --> 04:12.347
From your captor?

04:12.380 --> 04:14.018
How?

04:14.050 --> 04:18.339
- I jumped out of the car.
- While you were blindfolded?

04:18.390 --> 04:19.982
Yeah, I tore it off, and I
ran straight into the woods

04:20.020 --> 04:21.419
so that he couldn't catch me.

04:21.460 --> 04:23.883
But on the night of this photo,

04:23.930 --> 04:27.058
you managed to make it back
to Rosewood and...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.727
you found your friends.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.967
I asked them to hide me.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.730
You thought that they would be
more helpful than the police?

04:33.770 --> 04:35.397
Your parents?

04:35.440 --> 04:36.634
I was scared.

04:36.670 --> 04:39.332
Okay, I was scared that
if I came back home

04:39.380 --> 04:42.804
and I was out in the open
that he'd find me again.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.306
So how did you protect her?

04:47.420 --> 04:49.945
They hid me in the woods.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.754
In a shed that we all
used to hang out in.

04:52.790 --> 04:54.018
After school, the weekends.

04:54.060 --> 04:57.985
But you just said that they came
to your rescue in Philadelphia.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.019
( door opens )

05:01.360 --> 05:02.668
( sighs )
Dad!

05:02.700 --> 05:04.691
- Oh, my God!
- Dad.

05:08.540 --> 05:09.666
Was I sleeping on that bus?

05:09.710 --> 05:11.666
When did we discuss kidnapping?

05:11.710 --> 05:13.837
- We didn't.
- Why is it just her dad?

05:13.880 --> 05:15.802
- Where is her mother?
- I don't know.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.740
Emily, call your mother.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.985
Her flight from Dallas was
canceled because of the storms.

05:26.020 --> 05:28.750
You're welcome to stay here
as long as you need to.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.428
Thank you.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.928
I'll, uh, I'll call her
from outside.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.829
Hold it.

05:38.870 --> 05:40.428
Where are you going?

05:40.470 --> 05:41.869
I am so tired.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.561
I just wanted to go upstairs
and take a shower--

05:43.610 --> 05:46.067
And go to bed? Really?

05:46.110 --> 05:49.409
Without telling me where you've
been for the past few days?

05:49.450 --> 05:51.702
You might have a hard time
falling asleep if I'm poking you

05:51.750 --> 05:54.469
every five seconds
with a new question.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.444
You knew Alison was alive
for over a month

05:57.490 --> 05:59.458
- and you never said a word?
- I didn't mean to--

05:59.490 --> 06:00.889
Why would you keep
this kind of secret?

06:00.920 --> 06:02.148
Because we made a promise.

06:02.190 --> 06:04.078
Well, you obviously
didn't think it through.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.449
Did you?

06:05.490 --> 06:07.128
Because there's still
a dead girl

06:07.160 --> 06:09.128
in Alison's grave
that the police--

06:09.160 --> 06:11.526
I don't know who that is.
And I had nothing to do with it,

06:11.570 --> 06:14.733
and whether you believe me
or not, Mom, that is the truth.

06:14.770 --> 06:16.032
( sobbing )

06:16.070 --> 06:17.105
Wait.

06:19.210 --> 06:22.134
I'm not accusing you of anything
right now but poor judgment.

06:23.180 --> 06:24.272
While you were gone,

06:24.310 --> 06:27.416
your father and I were
dragged down to that precinct.

06:27.450 --> 06:29.042
What? Where's Dad?

06:29.080 --> 06:30.741
In Philly.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.156
They found your car
and impounded it.

06:33.190 --> 06:35.579
He went down there with Melissa
to get It out.

06:36.990 --> 06:38.787
Is she back from London?

06:38.830 --> 06:40.991
Oh, yes! And don't expect
any souvenirs,

06:41.030 --> 06:42.998
because all she brought back
was attitude.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.167
And secrets.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.873
ASHLEY: Did you ever plan
on telling me the truth?

06:57.910 --> 06:59.446
Of course I did.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.710
But we had to wait
until it felt safe.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.889
You feel that way now?

07:03.920 --> 07:06.809
- Yeah. Kind of.
- How?

07:06.860 --> 07:09.522
The person who did this
to Alison is still out there.

07:09.560 --> 07:10.686
Is this cheese old?

07:10.730 --> 07:11.981
It's Havarti.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.919
- Does it melt?
- All cheese melts, Hanna.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.598
Hey! Look at me.

07:16.630 --> 07:19.019
How did you feel
when you found out
Alison was still alive?

07:19.070 --> 07:20.697
What do you mean?

07:21.700 --> 07:22.962
Sweetie.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.501
You have kept a lot of secrets
from me,

07:25.540 --> 07:28.907
but this one is right up there
with The Manhattan Project.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.942
The what?

07:30.980 --> 07:33.244
I don't understand how you
got up in the morning,

07:33.280 --> 07:35.077
went to school, knowing that
Alison was still in danger.

07:35.120 --> 07:36.678
That poor girl must just be--

07:36.720 --> 07:39.018
Mom, she wants to move on.
Okay?

07:39.050 --> 07:41.848
And the more people talk about
it and ask a billion questions,

07:41.890 --> 07:43.858
the harder
it's gonna be for her!

07:43.890 --> 07:44.959
Yes, it was a nightmare,

07:44.990 --> 07:47.595
but it's over
and she needs it to end.

07:48.900 --> 07:49.696
Hey.

07:52.030 --> 07:55.591
Sit down, okay?
I'll make this for you.

07:55.640 --> 07:59.531
Yes. It's_ Fitz. F-I-T-Z.
He got admitted on Saturday

07:59.580 --> 08:01.468
- and he had surgery.
- ( door knocks )

08:02.810 --> 08:04.004
Yeah, come in.

08:05.680 --> 08:06.977
Oh! I thought you were Dad.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.874
No. He's downstairs.
Hey...

08:08.920 --> 08:10.717
Is it true?

08:10.750 --> 08:12.513
Is Alison alive
and back in her house?

08:14.760 --> 08:16.580
Wow. That's insane.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.690
I heard Dad telling Mom
that some freak had
her blind-folded, and--

08:19.730 --> 08:21.550
It's not a video game,
Mike.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.228
I'm not making a joke.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.760
She's tough.
I'm kind of surprised

08:27.300 --> 08:28.836
Just stop.

08:28.870 --> 08:30.235
Please! Stop.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.508
Why is Mr. Fitz
in the hospital?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.203
What?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.639
The door is made of wood,
not plutonium.

08:43.650 --> 08:46.687
He's in New York
for the weekend,
and he got hurt.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.211
What happened?
Is he gonna be okay?

08:49.260 --> 08:50.818
Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

08:50.860 --> 08:53.021
I saw him yesterday.
He is gonna be just fine.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.756
Wait.
You said he was in New York.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.529
How did you see him
if you guys were in Philly?

08:58.770 --> 09:01.034
I didn't see him.
I spoke to him.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.937
Look, Mike, I'm exhausted,
so I'm gonna go to sleep.

09:05.070 --> 09:06.537
( sighs )

09:13.350 --> 09:17.810
She never saw this person, Mom.
She only heard his voice.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.989
I--I guess he had her
locked in a room or...

09:20.020 --> 09:21.783
I don't know.

09:21.820 --> 09:23.981
Look, can we talk
about this later? Please.

09:25.230 --> 09:26.322
Okay.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.157
Yeah. I love you, too.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.758
Bye.

09:29.800 --> 09:30.960
( phone beeps )

09:31.000 --> 09:32.126
What's wrong?

09:32.170 --> 09:34.161
What's not?

09:34.200 --> 09:35.531
We made a pact, Emily.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.069
and now all of a sudden
we're back on Planet Alison.

09:41.110 --> 09:42.202
Okay, Spencer--

09:42.240 --> 09:44.276
It's like it's 9th grade
all over again,

09:44.310 --> 09:46.107
and we are here on
"The Whirly Girlie Ride."

09:46.150 --> 09:50.189
And All goes rogue,
and we're just expected
to backup her story.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.017
You're even adding
to the lie.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.312
Why is she
still controlling us?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.850
Maybe she flipped
last minute

09:54.890 --> 09:56.824
because she wanted
to protect her mom.

09:56.860 --> 09:58.828
Maybe she wanted
to hear why her mom

09:58.860 --> 09:59.622
did what she did
before it gets

09:59.660 --> 10:00.797
forced out of her
by the police.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.196
Are you really gonna stay here
and defend All right now?

10:03.230 --> 10:05.095
I am not...
( door opens )

10:05.130 --> 10:07.269
( leaves rustling )

10:15.810 --> 10:17.072
Okay.
Is it just me or

10:17.110 --> 10:19.169
it's really a weird time
to detail your car.

10:19.210 --> 10:21.110
Does Jason not know
that she is home?

10:22.220 --> 10:23.983
Of course he knows.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.112
( car door slams )

10:25.150 --> 10:26.082
The only question is why
would you be

10:26.120 --> 10:28.054
squee-gee-ing your backseat
if your sister

10:28.090 --> 10:29.318
just got back
from the dead?

10:38.030 --> 10:40.794
( crickets chirping )

10:43.140 --> 10:45.165
( window creaking )

10:51.210 --> 10:52.848
- What is that?
- Her phone?

10:57.190 --> 10:59.146
Who sent you this?

11:39.290 --> 11:41.724
MR. DiLAURENTIS:
Hey, you there...

11:41.760 --> 11:45.264
I was thinking maybe you
wanna sleep downstairs tonight,

11:45.300 --> 11:47.939
you won't have to be in here
by yourself.

11:47.970 --> 11:49.096
It's okay, Dad.

11:51.110 --> 11:54.204
I've been dreaming about
this moment for a long time-

11:54.240 --> 11:55.901
Sleeping in my own bed.

11:55.940 --> 11:58.249
I understand... Ijust...

12:00.120 --> 12:02.816
I don't think I can ever
let you out of my sight again.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.955
Have you heard from mom?

12:06.990 --> 12:09.959
Ah, your brother and I had
been trying to reach her,

12:09.990 --> 12:13.221
I can't say I'm not worried,
because I am.

12:13.260 --> 12:15.125
I'm sure she's fine.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.526
Alison,

12:18.570 --> 12:21.994
I know this is maybe
asking for too much,

12:22.040 --> 12:25.931
but-um...
I want you to feel safe.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.177
I've asked the police to
put up a barrier

12:28.210 --> 12:29.939
at the end of the street.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.974
Lot of people are gonna
wanna hear your story,

12:34.020 --> 12:37.786
but you don't have to leave
this house or talk to anybody

12:37.820 --> 12:39.048
until you're ready.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.029
I, um...

12:44.830 --> 12:48.288
I can't give you
those years back.

12:48.330 --> 12:51.527
Alison, I can't, but

12:51.570 --> 12:54.892
I promise I will
do everything I can

12:54.940 --> 12:56.931
to help you forget them.

13:01.580 --> 13:06.005
Uhh...do you remember this?

13:06.050 --> 13:08.939
I've had it my wallet since
the night we lost you.

13:08.980 --> 13:10.288
( breathing heavily)

13:10.320 --> 13:14.950
This is the little girl
I refuse to let go off.

13:29.340 --> 13:31.205
( sobbing )

13:33.940 --> 13:35.339
Honey I need
to know that

13:35.380 --> 13:37.348
( clears throat )
your mom and I-

13:39.650 --> 13:42.915
we aren't living
together anymore.

13:42.950 --> 13:46.113
Uh...we decided a few months
ago to get a divorce.

13:46.150 --> 13:49.358
I know.
Emily told me.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.056
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.852
So am I.

14:19.990 --> 14:21.582
( gunshot)

14:23.060 --> 14:24.220
She's dead!

14:26.190 --> 14:28.397
(violin playing )

14:34.270 --> 14:36.864
( playing continues )

14:50.690 --> 14:52.954
( phone beeping )

14:55.160 --> 14:56.616
ARIA:
Hanna what's going on?

14:56.660 --> 14:58.981
I have no idea-I mean,
who do you think sent it?

14:59.030 --> 15:00.292
Sent what?

15:02.560 --> 15:03.993
Not tell me what?

15:04.030 --> 15:05.167
HANNA:
We thought you were freaked out

15:05.200 --> 15:06.360
about everything still.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.163
Uh...Ha..Hanna, talk to me.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.668
Ali got a message on her phone,
she saw it when she opened

15:10.710 --> 15:12.268
up her purse at
the police station,

15:12.310 --> 15:14.278
that's why she
lied to Holbrook.

15:14.310 --> 15:15.379
A message from "A?"

15:15.410 --> 15:18.004
"A" is dead already.
Remember?

15:18.050 --> 15:20.268
WOMAN: Hanna,
honey you still up?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.344
I got to go.

15:21.380 --> 15:22.472
( phone drop tone )

15:33.430 --> 15:35.159
( hinge creaking )

16:05.260 --> 16:07.125
( hinge creaking )

16:12.100 --> 16:14.762
( doorbell rings )

16:14.800 --> 16:18.201
Good morning.
May I come in?

16:18.240 --> 16:19.104
Of course.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.249
MR. DiLAURENTIS:
I'm sorry to bother you.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.009
Please.
You are not bothering me.

16:25.050 --> 16:26.369
I've been thinking
about your family.

16:26.410 --> 16:30.187
Ashley,
I need your help.

16:30.220 --> 16:32.017
Okay.

16:32.050 --> 16:34.052
Can I offer you some coffee?

16:34.090 --> 16:38.186
I can't imagine what this must
be like for you and Jessica.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.027
Have you heard from her?

16:40.060 --> 16:41.220
No.

16:41.260 --> 16:43.228
I didn't go to office today.

16:43.270 --> 16:46.159
Our daughter is alive and home.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.565
And her own mother
isn't there to greet her.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.238
Where is she?

16:49.270 --> 16:52.364
I have to believe. Jessica
doesn't know that Alison's home.

16:52.410 --> 16:55.777
You know the things have not
been good between me and her.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.779
She changed the password
on her business account.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.675
If you could
go through her email.

17:00.720 --> 17:03.712
Oh! I-I don't know
if I could do that.

17:03.750 --> 17:06.116
Is there a chance
Jason might know where she is?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.481
Oh! Forget about Jason.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.714
May be he is in a state of shock

17:08.760 --> 17:10.625
or maybe his brain
is so deadened

17:10.660 --> 17:13.254
from drugs that he can't
act like a human being anymore.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.495
He hasn't shed a tear
since he saw his sister.

17:15.530 --> 17:17.293
I'm guessing that's shock.

17:17.330 --> 17:19.469
Please...

17:20.500 --> 17:22.161
Help me.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.501
( birds chirping )

17:35.780 --> 17:37.281
What are you doing?

17:37.320 --> 17:38.810
Ali, you can't be out here.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.489
There is about 10 cars at the
end of our street. Alright?

17:41.520 --> 17:42.748
Press, police.

17:42.790 --> 17:45.088
I'm not twerking through town.

17:45.130 --> 17:46.154
Okay?

17:46.190 --> 17:48.090
I just wanna sit on my porch.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.839
You haven't asked me
any questions.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.228
How come?

17:58.270 --> 18:00.204
Figured you might
need your space.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.176
What was mom's reaction?

18:06.210 --> 18:08.747
When she found out
I was still alive?

18:08.780 --> 18:11.180
She was stunned.
What do you expect?

18:13.420 --> 18:14.455
Get inside.

18:14.490 --> 18:16.185
( door opens )

18:16.220 --> 18:18.825
Can I help you?

18:18.860 --> 18:20.828
I've an appointment with
Mrs. DiLaurentis.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.293
Who are you?

18:22.330 --> 18:24.264
Kathy Paras.
County shelter.

18:24.300 --> 18:26.461
We arranged to bring puppy over
this morning.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.331
Mrs. DiLaurentis wants
to adopt him.

18:28.370 --> 18:29.689
Sit.
( dog barking )

18:29.740 --> 18:31.207
Good, boy.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.208
My mother didn't order this.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.879
It's a dog, cowboy,
not a pizza.

18:35.910 --> 18:39.346
- And she did.
- He IS so smart.

18:39.380 --> 18:40.369
Yeah.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.444
Why was he at the shelter?

18:41.480 --> 18:44.415
Oh! He's got issues
mostly with men.

18:44.450 --> 18:46.384
Put him back in the van.

18:46.420 --> 18:48.354
Now!

18:48.390 --> 18:50.358
What happens to him
if we don't take him?

18:50.390 --> 18:53.723
Basically, Mrs. D. was
last stop on his train.

18:53.760 --> 18:54.795
It's not pretty.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.691
( music playing )

19:03.510 --> 19:05.239
Do you need any help?

19:05.270 --> 19:08.239
Oh, hey. Um.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.838
No.

19:09.880 --> 19:11.802
I got it.
( music continues )

19:11.850 --> 19:14.774
Hey, you heard about Alison,
right?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.708
She's alive.

19:16.750 --> 19:18.513
Pretty twisted
what happened to her.

19:18.550 --> 19:19.915
Quite a story.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.850
That psycho is probably
circling this town

19:21.890 --> 19:23.619
looking for his next victim.

19:23.660 --> 19:25.878
Which is why we need to
fight back.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.158
What's in the box?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.455
Whistles.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.798
I ordered one for every
girl in the school.

19:31.830 --> 19:33.593
And I'm asking the principal
to get us all

19:33.640 --> 19:34.732
special apps for our phones.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.659
It's either this or we all
hire full-time bodyguards.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.938
Yeah. I would apply
for that job

19:38.970 --> 19:41.530
if you could stand being
around me that much.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.548
I gotta go. Principal Hackett
is waiting for me.

19:43.580 --> 19:44.569
Mona...

19:46.580 --> 19:47.877
I miss you.

19:49.720 --> 19:50.812
( door opens )

19:50.850 --> 19:52.579
Em?

19:52.620 --> 19:54.588
Wait up. My mom said us
to stay close to home.

19:54.620 --> 19:55.780
I am not going to school.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.321
I'm just giving
Ali's phone back to her.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.690
Hanna told the Aria
about the text.

20:01.730 --> 20:04.290
Why would she do that?
Because she's Hanna.

20:04.330 --> 20:05.922
And now Aria is freaked out.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.291
She thinks A is back and
she's one text away

20:08.340 --> 20:09.659
from being turned
into the police.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.567
A is dead.
Yeah, I know that. But--

20:12.610 --> 20:13.975
but part of me thinks that

20:14.010 --> 20:16.979
that text was Jenna's way
of welcoming Alison home.

20:17.010 --> 20:19.899
We can handle Jenna and others,
five of us and one of her.

20:19.950 --> 20:24.239
Yeah, but we killed
that hers... Her.

20:24.290 --> 20:26.542
What are you doing?

20:26.590 --> 20:29.218
We never looked last night
to see what Jason threw out,

20:30.860 --> 20:33.658
and we probably should have-
look at this,

20:33.700 --> 20:35.224
when was Jason in New York?

20:37.330 --> 20:38.524
That's why no rush.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.333
Sorry, you channeling your
Filipino grandmother right now?

20:40.370 --> 20:41.997
To see Alison.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.860
We-we knew that
his whole visit

20:43.910 --> 20:46.003
to rehab was a big fat lie.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.804
What if he is been
following her for weeks?

20:48.840 --> 20:52.606
What if Mrs. D's had him
tracking her for months, years.

20:52.650 --> 20:53.969
Do you think Jason
sent that text?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.840
Spencer, if All told
the whole truth,

20:55.880 --> 20:57.347
her mother would go down.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.847
If Mrs. D thought that someone
just killed her child,

20:59.890 --> 21:02.654
who else would she cover
for beSIdes her other one?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.921
( song playing )

21:20.340 --> 21:22.831
( song fades )

21:25.010 --> 21:28.275
(violin playing )

21:36.720 --> 21:38.529
( another violin playing )

21:40.560 --> 21:42.653
( another violin playing )

21:53.070 --> 21:54.708
Ali, it can't be a coincidence,

21:54.740 --> 21:57.675
Jason came back_ from New York
the same night as us.

21:57.710 --> 22:01.077
He was in my room last night,
watching me sleep.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.678
EMILY: Jason?

22:02.720 --> 22:04.585
Oh my, God!

22:04.620 --> 22:06.042
You can't_
stay here tonight,

22:06.090 --> 22:07.955
you need to tell your dad
you wanna sleep at Spencer's.

22:07.990 --> 22:09.582
It's never gonna to happen.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.929
I mean, he won't even let me
walk to the freaking mailbox.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.520
Where are you in this,
Spencer?

22:14.560 --> 22:16.551
You haven't even said a word.

22:16.600 --> 22:18.625
Should I be afraid of our
big brother?

22:19.730 --> 22:22.995
I know you told him.
Don't sweat it.

22:23.040 --> 22:25.429
I'm even starting to think
that my dad knows too.

22:25.470 --> 22:26.698
So you think Jason is the one

22:26.740 --> 22:28.401
that slammed that
rock in my head?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.477
I mean, is that why my mom
has just magically disappeared

22:31.510 --> 22:32.772
as soon as I decide
to come home?

22:32.810 --> 22:35.040
I don't know. Maybe.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.083
And you were needling both of
our families with that secret,

22:38.120 --> 22:40.714
they probably both
wanted you to shut up.

22:40.760 --> 22:42.614
So you think that's why
he went after me?

22:42.660 --> 22:45.857
I can't say for sure, but if
your mom did choose him over you

22:45.890 --> 22:48.427
she had every reason to make
the rest of us look bad,

22:48.460 --> 22:50.724
and we've been framed
as pathological liars

22:50.770 --> 22:51.964
ever since then.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.797
So if we ever did find
out who hit you,

22:53.840 --> 22:55.467
nobody would even
believe us.

22:55.500 --> 22:58.936
Wow. You really have given
it some thought.

22:58.970 --> 23:01.438
Look, my mom comes back
tomorrow.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.538
You can stay with us.

23:02.580 --> 23:04.445
Emily, I just got back,

23:04.480 --> 23:06.607
my dad's not going
to let me out for sleepovers.

23:06.650 --> 23:07.674
Well, what're you
going to do?

23:08.920 --> 23:10.444
I have a few ideas.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.117
Well, can you
let us in on them?

23:12.150 --> 23:14.118
So that we're not caught
paddling around like idiots

23:14.160 --> 23:15.115
trying to play catch-up?

23:15.160 --> 23:16.616
I told you Spencer--

23:16.660 --> 23:18.924
I made up that lie to
protect Aria.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.621
She kind of killed someone,
remember?

23:20.660 --> 23:22.093
You could have
consulted us first.

23:22.130 --> 23:25.167
Okay, guys,
please stop.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.861
What's done is done.

23:26.900 --> 23:29.960
We need to focus our energy
on who's trying to sink us now.

23:34.940 --> 23:36.828
Hey, you just got up?

23:36.880 --> 23:39.075
Yeah, what you're doing?

23:40.650 --> 23:43.448
I'm
, u
m

23:43.490 --> 23:46.141
Doing some work
for Alison's father.

23:49.090 --> 23:53.186
He wants me to get a lead
on where Jessica might be.

23:53.230 --> 23:55.448
I'm...I was about to open up
some of her emails,

23:55.500 --> 23:58.162
and 1-1 just can't do this.

23:58.200 --> 23:59.565
Why?

24:00.740 --> 24:03.129
Hanna, the last thing I wanna
do is get in the middle

24:03.170 --> 24:05.730
of two people who are
going through divorce,

24:05.770 --> 24:07.670
and it's not just an
invasion of privacy...

24:07.710 --> 24:09.803
it feels like a betrayal.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.070
Well, I'm betting Mrs. D would
rather have you looking

24:12.110 --> 24:14.715
through her emails
than the police.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.787
And besides, Ali needs
her mom right now.

24:17.820 --> 24:20.186
( phone ringing )

24:27.630 --> 24:28.858
( ringing continues )

24:30.770 --> 24:32.226
WOMAN: Take milk or sugar?

24:32.270 --> 24:33.589
MAN: Milk is great

24:35.070 --> 24:36.697
Hey!

24:36.740 --> 24:38.503
Hi.

24:40.910 --> 24:44.277
- When did you get back?
- Mm-late last night.

24:44.310 --> 24:46.801
This morning-I don't know
I think I had dinner

24:46.850 --> 24:47.874
on two continents.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.615
Why didn't you call me?

24:49.650 --> 24:52.687
No, 1-1 thought I'd
come by and see you.

24:53.960 --> 24:55.712
Why? What's going on?

24:55.760 --> 24:57.751
Melissa told your father
and me that she

24:57.790 --> 25:00.588
saw Toby in London,
that's why she rushed back,

25:00.630 --> 25:02.848
but apparently
that never happened.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.197
What?

25:04.230 --> 25:05.925
I went to her place,
Wren answered the door,

25:05.970 --> 25:07.528
he said he was staying there,

25:07.570 --> 25:08.867
_ and she wasn't
In London anymore.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.197
It doesn't make sense.

25:10.240 --> 25:11.832
Oh, if you want,
you can call him.

25:11.870 --> 25:13.201
Wren? Oh, please!

25:13.240 --> 25:15.879
I'd rather stick
a knife in the toaster.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.799
I have a client to meet in town,

25:18.850 --> 25:21.273
you on the other hand
are staying close to home.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.208
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.888
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.512
Bye.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.751
( door closes )

25:29.790 --> 25:31.326
Why did you go to London?

25:31.360 --> 25:33.089
I wanted answers for you.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.291
I figured if I could get
your sister look me in the eye

25:35.330 --> 25:37.924
- and tell me something.
- Something truthful?

25:39.070 --> 25:40.196
Right.

25:41.370 --> 25:44.100
- Do you know about...
- Alison?

25:44.140 --> 25:45.232
Yeah.

25:45.270 --> 25:46.339
I've heard some
pretty weIrd stuff

25:46.370 --> 25:48.133
but I'd rather hear
it from you.

25:51.950 --> 25:53.247
Aria.

25:53.280 --> 25:55.339
Sorry. I didn't mean
to scare you.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.587
Just got your text...
I was with Ali.

25:59.250 --> 26:00.888
What are you doing?

26:00.920 --> 26:02.785
If we've been out here
hiding her for a month

26:02.820 --> 26:04.822
it sure as hell needs start
lookIng |Ike It.

26:04.860 --> 26:06.885
Seriously, you can't
do this right now.

26:06.930 --> 26:08.192
Yeah, you're right.

26:08.230 --> 26:10.050
We should have been out
here last night filling this

26:10.100 --> 26:12.921
place with crap after
Alison got that text.

26:12.970 --> 26:15.666
Oh, and thank you for keeping
me in the dark about that.

26:15.700 --> 26:16.894
What am I? Your child?

26:16.940 --> 26:19.363
We only did that because you
were such a mess when your dad

26:19.410 --> 26:21.970
- came to the police station.
- Yeah and what?

26:22.010 --> 26:23.329
What you thought
if I got a good night's sleep,

26:23.380 --> 26:25.200
I'd just wake up
in candy land?

26:25.250 --> 26:27.070
Okay, Aria calm down.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.340
- That text wasn't from "A".
- How do you know that?

26:29.380 --> 26:32.816
Because I was there when
Shana-slash-A was killed.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.123
Look... Spencer was right.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.196
It's one thing not to
contradict Ali's story

26:41.230 --> 26:42.925
and it's another to add to it.

26:42.960 --> 26:44.860
We can't go down that
rabbit hole again.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.835
Yeah, well,
I can't do nothing, all right?

26:47.870 --> 26:49.690
Because if "A" knows that
I took down Shana,

26:49.740 --> 26:50.866
- Aria...
- I'm going to be the...

26:50.910 --> 26:53.367
Shana had been using us
as target practice for months,

26:53.410 --> 26:54.900
what you did was purely

26:54.940 --> 26:56.771
- self-defense.
- I doesn't matter.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.949
Someone is dead.

26:58.980 --> 27:01.847
All right, and she will never
be able to recover or apologize

27:01.880 --> 27:04.849
or even graduate from high
school because I killed her.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.949
I killed her, Emily, and I don't
know how I'm gonna be able

27:06.990 --> 27:09.049
to live with that.

27:11.160 --> 27:12.957
( breathes heavily)

27:23.040 --> 27:24.302
Aria...

27:25.340 --> 27:29.401
in that moment,
it was you or her.

27:30.710 --> 27:34.043
I went through
this after...

27:35.050 --> 27:36.369
Nate.

27:38.420 --> 27:41.082
You think that no one can
understand what this feels like,

27:42.190 --> 27:43.919
but I've been there.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.131
( empty can clinking )

27:57.270 --> 27:59.329
Remember, we used
to sneak out here?

28:00.940 --> 28:02.168
Our biggest problem was

28:02.210 --> 28:04.075
how to eat peanut butter
with braces.

28:11.290 --> 28:12.314
( car honking )

28:12.350 --> 28:14.784
Is there enough paper
in that printer?

28:14.820 --> 28:17.209
Uh, yeah there should be a
couple of pages in there,

28:17.260 --> 28:19.023
do you want me to get you
some more?

28:19.060 --> 28:20.288
No, that's all right.
I'll get it.

28:49.520 --> 28:52.057
* I'll be your light, your match
your burning sun *

28:52.090 --> 28:56.151
* I'll be the bright, in black
that's making you run *

28:56.200 --> 29:00.091
* And we'll feel alright,
and we'll feel alright *

29:00.130 --> 29:03.964
* Cause we'll work it out,
yes we'll work it out *

29:04.010 --> 29:07.969
* I'll be doin' this,
if you had a doubt *

29:08.010 --> 29:11.969
* Till the love runs out,
'til the love runs out *

29:12.010 --> 29:16.140
* I'll be your ghost, your game,
your stadium *

29:18.220 --> 29:20.017
The next time
you go to London...

29:20.050 --> 29:21.381
Yeah.

29:21.420 --> 29:23.354
You're taking me with you.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.059
And we're never coming back.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.991
* I'll be doin' this,
if you ever doubt *

29:32.030 --> 29:34.134
MR. DiLAURENTIS: What's so
pressing that you have to leave?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.263
What's in Philly?
Or should I ask, Who?

29:36.300 --> 29:38.165
I need to drop something
off to a friend.

29:38.210 --> 29:40.235
- Right now?
- I said after dinner.

29:40.270 --> 29:41.976
Your sister has been
gone for nearly a...

29:42.010 --> 29:43.841
Then I will wait
till she goes asleep, okay?

29:43.880 --> 29:45.871
What makes you think
she can sleep?

29:45.910 --> 29:48.242
Her mother is still not here,
and I am thinking

29:51.190 --> 29:53.146
Think what you want.
I don't.

29:53.190 --> 29:54.589
Jason, every time
someone in this family

29:54.620 --> 29:56.952
walks out of this house
It's a news story

29:56.990 --> 29:59.151
and the last thing
I want is you speaking

29:59.190 --> 30:00.896
to a damn reporter.

30:00.930 --> 30:02.295
Ow, don't worry, Dad...

30:02.330 --> 30:05.026
I won't embarrass you anymore
than I already have.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.164
Emily... I didn't know
you were here.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.191
Ali asked me to take
Pepe for a walk.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.404
Whose dog is that?

30:13.940 --> 30:16.033
You brought home a dog?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.206
It was dropped
off this morning.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.844
Mom rescued him
from the shelter.

30:18.880 --> 30:21.440
Really? Well! maybe when you
go to Philly you can tell her

30:21.480 --> 30:24.608
there is more than a dog
waiting for her back home.

30:24.650 --> 30:27.118
I can't do anymore.

30:27.150 --> 30:28.185
Are you gonna to go for it?

30:28.220 --> 30:30.154
- No, go ahead.
- You wanted it.

30:30.190 --> 30:32.021
( door slams )

30:32.060 --> 30:34.290
- Hello, Aria.
- Hey, where have you been?

30:34.330 --> 30:35.922
Dad told me to order dinner.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.099
- There is a veggie...
- I'm not hungry.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.894
Were you walking around
in the dark all by yourself?

30:40.940 --> 30:43.135
- Excuse me?
- Given what happened to Alison

30:43.170 --> 30:44.262
I can't believe you
would walk to the curb

30:44.310 --> 30:46.039
without a police escort.

30:46.070 --> 30:49.073
Hey, I borrowed this...
Again.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.608
What do you mean
you borrowed it?

30:53.650 --> 30:55.345
As in, I didn't take it
and keep it.

30:55.380 --> 30:56.938
Why would you
borrow it at all?

30:56.980 --> 30:58.242
'Cause I needed to put some
music together

30:58.290 --> 30:59.439
for a social studies project.

30:59.490 --> 31:01.219
It was that...

31:01.260 --> 31:03.319
That v_iolin music.
Was that comIng from your room

31:03.360 --> 31:04.884
- last night?
- I guess...

31:04.930 --> 31:06.955
Sorry. Iwill grab
my jacket and take you home.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.093
You can drop me at the library.

31:08.130 --> 31:09.449
I still have
some research to do.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.958
Mona?
Yeah?

31:15.000 --> 31:18.128
You doing your research
in the library or in this house?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.365
Your brother invited
me to dInner.

31:20.410 --> 31:22.105
But I am actually
really glad to see you

31:22.140 --> 31:25.371
because I can give
you this in person.

31:27.380 --> 31:28.369
Go on take it.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.240
I've got hundreds more.

31:30.280 --> 31:32.441
If anything else, we can use
what happened to Alison

31:32.490 --> 31:35.050
as a wakeup call,
nobody is safe.

31:35.090 --> 31:37.115
What are you
trying to prove, Mona?

31:37.160 --> 31:39.651
- Is this a threat?
- No, it's a whistle.

31:39.690 --> 31:40.918
You put it
between your lips and blow.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.168
We all know where you were the
night that Alison disappeared.

31:44.200 --> 31:45.667
She told us about the
time you spent together

31:45.700 --> 31:47.588
at the Lost Woods motel room.

31:47.630 --> 31:50.030
You have a few stories of your
own to keep quiet, don't you?

31:52.970 --> 31:56.599
Tell me... how
is Mr. Fitz doing?

31:56.640 --> 31:59.108
Will he make a full recovery?

31:59.150 --> 32:00.640
MIKE: Can I have the car keys?

32:02.620 --> 32:03.917
Aria.

32:07.590 --> 32:10.013
There is a meditation center
that Mrs. D once went to,

32:10.060 --> 32:11.254
you can try calling there...

32:11.290 --> 32:13.656
Thank you, Hanna,
and thank your mother for me.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.248
We were just about to
have dinner.

32:15.300 --> 32:16.551
If you girls want to join us?

32:16.600 --> 32:19.569
- Sure.
- We-We can't tonight.

32:19.600 --> 32:22.034
Uhh... Right. Maybe tomorrow.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.264
Anytime.

32:32.110 --> 32:34.249
What's going on?
Why can't I eat dinner?

32:34.280 --> 32:36.214
Just get in the car.
I've to show you something.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.286
It's an update on Mrs. D.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.641
Ali's dad thinks he's
hiding her in Philly.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.112
Wait, who's hiding her?

32:42.160 --> 32:43.149
Jason.

32:46.360 --> 32:48.658
Jason told his dad he had
to drop something off to

32:48.700 --> 32:50.224
a friend in Philly.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.125
Could that be code
for New York?

32:53.430 --> 32:54.533
What is this?

32:54.570 --> 32:56.697
Mrs. D wrote that email
the nIght that she escaped town,

32:56.740 --> 32:58.207
but she never sent it.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.629
It says, I can't protect
you anymore.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.638
Who would she have
written that to?

33:02.680 --> 33:04.602
( both gasp )

33:04.650 --> 33:06.971
( breathing heavily)

33:08.080 --> 33:09.217
What's up, Jason?

33:09.250 --> 33:11.115
I just saw what you delivered.

33:11.150 --> 33:12.617
Your dad asked my mother...

33:12.650 --> 33:15.016
Yeah, well, my mother didn't.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.449
So, maybe it is time people
stay the hell out of places

33:17.490 --> 33:19.629
they don't belong.

33:19.660 --> 33:21.218
That includes you.

33:33.270 --> 33:34.339
Follow him.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.735
No, you follow him.
I have to change my underwear.

33:36.780 --> 33:37.769
Hanna, hurry up. Okay?

33:39.550 --> 33:41.074
Hurry up!

34:17.520 --> 34:19.647
There is no way his mom's
in there.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.284
Mrs. D wouldn't even walk
down this street.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.548
Why not?

34:23.590 --> 34:24.579
If she's hiding out she's not
going to be doing it

34:24.630 --> 34:26.484
at the Four Seasons.

34:26.530 --> 34:28.521
We need to ring
the buzzer he pressed.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.495
Maybe Mrs. D will answer.
Come on...

34:35.540 --> 34:39.067
Was it this one?
Or was it, was it that one?

34:40.240 --> 34:41.776
Who are you looking for?

34:43.510 --> 34:45.444
Well, can I help you?

34:45.480 --> 34:47.573
Umm...

34:47.610 --> 34:51.182
1-1... I heard that there
might be a vacancy

34:51.220 --> 34:53.711
available for a sub-let.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.889
Sub-let?

34:55.920 --> 34:58.627
Who-who...who told
you that, huh?

34:58.660 --> 34:59.729
But, who are you?

34:59.760 --> 35:02.251
A real estate agent?
Get out of here.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.551
Now!

35:03.600 --> 35:05.795
Both of youse. Go!

35:07.170 --> 35:11.209
( phone beeping )
( music playIng )

35:14.940 --> 35:16.635
You don't want to get that?

35:18.310 --> 35:19.777
No.

35:20.950 --> 35:24.283
( music continues )
( beeping continues )

35:27.650 --> 35:30.289
( phone beeping again )

35:32.660 --> 35:34.696
Someone really wants
to reach you.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.623
Well, they can wait.

35:43.870 --> 35:46.907
Spence, what's going on?

35:48.610 --> 35:49.872
Nothing.

35:49.910 --> 35:51.241
Does it have
to do with Alison?

35:51.280 --> 35:52.474
( sighs )

35:53.580 --> 35:54.740
No.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.145
Is this about Melissa?

36:01.220 --> 36:02.687
No.

36:26.580 --> 36:27.604
( sound of footsteps )

36:29.320 --> 36:30.947
Did you follow me?

36:35.320 --> 36:37.481
I'm not supposed to
be out of my house,

36:38.790 --> 36:40.951
but I had to come
here to say goodbye.

36:46.730 --> 36:50.769
The girl they made that for,
she really is gone.

36:53.270 --> 36:55.704
I can't be that person
anymore, Mona.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.875
I know you hated me

37:00.050 --> 37:02.575
and wanted me to
go straIght to hell.

37:04.890 --> 37:08.018
Going there is easy...

37:08.050 --> 37:10.587
it's the coming back
that's hard...

37:13.330 --> 37:16.857
But you and me...we,
we understand each other.

37:18.730 --> 37:20.618
I need you, Mona.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.463
As a friend.

37:24.510 --> 37:27.502
The truth will bury you
in a New York minute.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.973
In case you're wondering,

37:29.010 --> 37:32.878
that was me,
I sent that text.

37:32.910 --> 37:35.879
I guess I should have
signed my name because

37:35.920 --> 37:39.481
I don't have to pretend
to be anyone else anymore.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.887
I don't have to hide.
You do.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.254
And you're gonna wish
you stayed dead.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.537
I'm going to the cops
tonight, I have to.

38:00.570 --> 38:02.037
You guys...I-I can't
hold on to this

38:02.080 --> 38:03.775
- Aria breathe. _
- Can you please waIt

38:03.810 --> 38:05.004
and discuss this
with all of us here?

38:05.050 --> 38:06.244
Where is Spencer?

38:06.280 --> 38:08.510
She went next door to distract
Mr. DiLaurentis so we could

38:08.550 --> 38:09.676
sneak Ali over here.

38:09.720 --> 38:11.779
She be_tter haul us because_
I'm guessmg Jason IS not makIng

38:11.820 --> 38:12.980
too many more stops tonight.

38:13.020 --> 38:15.909
Guys, please, enough
with Jason for a minute.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.986
Mona knows that we were in
New York. Don't you understand?

38:19.030 --> 38:21.021
Okay, it's only a matter of time
before she runs out of whistles

38:21.060 --> 38:23.620
and start tearing our balloons
and say Aria killed Shana.

38:23.660 --> 38:24.991
- Okay, whistles?
- Aria, stop. Okay.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.588
Mona does not
know about Shana.

38:26.630 --> 38:29.895
Then who does?
Who? Who is screwing with me?

38:29.940 --> 38:31.760
And you keep me telling me
that "A" is dead.

38:31.810 --> 38:33.004
"A" is dead, Aria.

38:33.040 --> 38:35.679
Then why am I hearing
a violin in my backyard?

38:35.710 --> 38:37.530
Who's the fiddler on my
freaking roof?

38:37.580 --> 38:40.743
Hey, Aria, listen to us.
Jason was the one in New York.

38:40.780 --> 38:42.668
Once we can prove that
he is a threat that made Ali

38:42.720 --> 38:43.948
tell that kidnapping
lie then...

38:43.980 --> 38:45.538
But how're we doing that?

38:45.590 --> 38:47.808
I don't know, that's why
we're having a meeting.

38:47.850 --> 38:49.954
Once the police are on to
Mrs. D and Jason,

38:49.990 --> 38:51.685
then everything we've
done can be explained

38:51.730 --> 38:53.652
and Alison can
finally tell the truth.

38:59.770 --> 39:02.534
( sound of footsteps )

39:04.040 --> 39:05.803
( door rumbles )

39:21.720 --> 39:23.051
Ali.

39:25.630 --> 39:27.359
Hey you up there?

39:34.130 --> 39:35.768
Hello?

39:37.600 --> 39:38.862
JASON: It's late.

39:41.840 --> 39:44.604
She may be asleep.

39:44.650 --> 39:46.641
Or did you come by
to take out the trash?

39:48.110 --> 39:49.543
Jason...

39:51.620 --> 39:54.009
Were you in New York the night
that All came back to Rosewood?

39:54.050 --> 39:55.950
Why?
Why is that important?

39:55.990 --> 39:57.116
I think you know why.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.583
If you're trying to make a
squirm and run for cover because

39:59.630 --> 40:00.654
of something that you did--

40:00.690 --> 40:02.920
What is it you think I did?

40:05.070 --> 40:07.925
You think I'm the one
who kidnapped her?

40:07.970 --> 40:10.029
Where did that theory
come from, huh?

40:10.070 --> 40:11.037
My father?

40:11.070 --> 40:12.708
- No.
- Really?

40:12.740 --> 40:14.935
'Cause he's probably down
at that precinct right now

40:14.980 --> 40:17.733
sharing that theory
with the cops.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.907
Without my mother,
who's going to stop him?

40:20.950 --> 40:23.919
Jason, why were
you in New York?

40:23.950 --> 40:26.680
( dog barking )

40:30.690 --> 40:32.578
( dog groaning )
Pepe.

40:33.660 --> 40:34.854
Pepe, what's wrong?

40:34.900 --> 40:36.094
( barking loudly)
How did she know it's name?

40:36.130 --> 40:37.597
Whose dog is that?

40:37.630 --> 40:39.518
Alison's.

40:39.570 --> 40:40.969
When did she had the
time to get a dog?

40:46.540 --> 40:47.632
( screaming )

40:47.670 --> 40:49.035
Oh, my God!

40:49.080 --> 40:50.729
Grrrrr...

40:50.780 --> 40:51.940
( barking loudly)

40:55.580 --> 40:56.740
( indistinct scream )
Jason.

40:56.780 --> 40:58.042
Don't...no...
Jason.

40:59.590 --> 41:00.887
( barking loudly)

41:03.590 --> 41:05.126
( breathing heavily)

41:10.030 --> 41:17.630
* But if I
never get to heaven *

41:17.670 --> 41:25.202
* Will you fly away to me

41:25.250 --> 41:33.112
* And if I
never get to heaven *

41:33.150 --> 41:40.750
* Say you'll come
and rescue me *

41:40.790 --> 41:42.758
* Rescue me

41:42.800 --> 41:46.099
* Please catch my tears

41:46.130 --> 41:48.769
( indistinct conversation
on police radio )

41:48.800 --> 41:56.138
* Yeah... Will you carry me

41:56.180 --> 42:00.173
* Or do I deserve
to walk alone *

42:00.210 --> 42:04.146
* Only farther than
I've ever known *

42:04.180 --> 42:11.052
* Don't leave me here
on my own *

42:11.090 --> 42:20.829
* And if I
never get to heaven *

42:20.870 --> 42:28.231
* Do you think
I'll still be free *

42:28.270 --> 42:35.870
* And if I
never get to heaven *

42:35.920 --> 42:43.179
* Say you'll come
and be with me *

42:43.220 --> 42:45.029
* Be with me
