00:03.371 --> 00:06.274
[theme music]

00:08.342 --> 00:10.978
Check out the
heft on that paper.

00:11.011 --> 00:13.681
It's thicker than the
paneling in DJ's room.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.317
What have you got there?

00:16.350 --> 00:17.685
Oh, look at this.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.554
Dear future friend, you
have been selected to attend

00:20.588 --> 00:23.891
a member's-only luncheon at the
exclusive Lanford Country Club.

00:23.924 --> 00:26.394
We've arrived.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.696
Your presence is
greatly anticipated.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.997
Look at this.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.699
Look at that.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.067
The letters are raised.

00:33.101 --> 00:37.105
It's like they punched
it out from the bag.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.939
This is the Lanford elite.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.608
What am I going to wear?

00:40.641 --> 00:46.080
How am I going to move?

00:46.114 --> 00:48.349
There's nothing
to worry about.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.584
We've wined and dined
with the rich and famous.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.786
Remember, we were on the
vineyard with the Wentworths

00:52.820 --> 00:53.987
there.

00:54.021 --> 00:56.157
We hobnobbed with high
society over in New York.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.558
You're right.
You're right.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.960
We'll just walk right in there
with our heads held just high

00:59.993 --> 01:01.529
enough to look down our noses.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.996
Yeah.

01:03.030 --> 01:06.267
And what you do, you just keep
reaching for the cocktails.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.001
You talk about
foreign affairs, you

01:08.035 --> 01:10.003
know, specifically
like the caste system

01:10.037 --> 01:11.639
over there in India.

01:11.672 --> 01:14.442
And you just gripe how you
can't find no good help.

01:14.475 --> 01:15.843
I can do that.

01:15.876 --> 01:16.744
Sure, you can.

01:16.777 --> 01:17.811
It's simple.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.880
Forks to the left,
politics to the right.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.549
[theme song]

01:21.582 --> 01:25.553
What doesn't kill us
is making us stronger.

01:25.586 --> 01:30.358
We're going to last longer
than the Greatest Wall of China

01:30.391 --> 01:33.361
or that rabbit with the drum.

01:33.394 --> 01:38.832
If there is one thing that
I've learned while waiting

01:38.866 --> 01:42.336
for my turn is
that in each life,

01:42.370 --> 01:46.307
some rain falls, but
you also get some sun.

01:46.340 --> 01:49.810
And we'll make out
better than OK.

01:49.843 --> 01:52.313
Hey, hear what I say.

01:52.346 --> 01:55.249
Yeah, any day.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.065
This is just like
the old days, Roseanne.

02:12.099 --> 02:14.468
You know, you and me getting
all dressed up ready to go out.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.569
Yeah.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.305
You want me to hand you
a handful of Kleenex

02:17.338 --> 02:19.640
so you can stuff your bra?

02:19.673 --> 02:20.508
Look.

02:25.846 --> 02:29.517
Just because you were blessed
with enough to feed an army,

02:29.550 --> 02:32.220
doesn't mean that you have to
make fun of the little people.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.690
So are you all right that
the kids are visiting

02:36.724 --> 02:38.226
Dan in that hotel room today?

02:38.259 --> 02:39.993
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.364
I'll interrogate them
under the hot lights later.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.065
Sure is peaceful.

02:45.098 --> 02:46.400
Yeah.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.001
And with that toilet
running kind of

02:48.035 --> 02:51.539
reminds me of Yellowstone.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.041
OK, my left hand looks
good, but my right hand

02:54.074 --> 02:57.445
looks like I did it with
my left hand, which I did.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.848
I am so excited about going
to the country club today.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.716
And it's not like when we
were in high school, you know.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.117
We used to stand out
front there selling

03:04.151 --> 03:06.053
them back their own golf balls.

03:06.086 --> 03:09.189
Yeah, well, that's when
we were from the wrong side

03:09.223 --> 03:14.295
of the tracks, but now thanks
to the wise investment of $1,

03:14.328 --> 03:16.330
we're from the right side.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.131
You are so calm.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.667
Aren't you even a
little bit excited?

03:19.700 --> 03:20.668
Well, maybe.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.536
My stomach is all nervous.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.405
My stomach is fine.

03:24.438 --> 03:26.307
It's my big mouth
that frightens me.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.175
[laughter]

03:28.208 --> 03:29.810
I haven't eat.
That's what it is.

03:29.843 --> 03:30.911
I'm going to make
myself a snack.

03:30.944 --> 03:31.812
You want something?

03:31.845 --> 03:33.146
Are you crazy?

03:33.180 --> 03:35.182
This is the first time these
people are going to see me.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.617
I want to look my best.

03:36.650 --> 03:37.718
I mean, I'm going
to be squeezing

03:37.751 --> 03:41.889
my ass into a size 10 pant.

03:41.922 --> 03:45.326
Roseanne, and you have
to be able to breathe.

03:45.359 --> 03:49.463
You just keep me away
from that buffet table, OK?

03:49.497 --> 03:51.865
And prayed that
there is no celery

03:51.899 --> 03:55.503
stuffed with peanut butter.

03:55.536 --> 03:58.372
Do you think our crooked
mayor is going to be there?

03:58.406 --> 03:59.473
Yeah.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.174
I think he's got at
least a 10 mile radius

04:01.208 --> 04:02.510
on that little ankle bracelet.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.945
And do you think some of
our old bosses will be there?

04:04.978 --> 04:06.146
The Wellmans?

04:06.179 --> 04:07.247
Wouldn't that be weird?

04:07.281 --> 04:09.249
No, I don't think so,
because it's Saturday,

04:09.283 --> 04:11.819
and Saturdays are
flog-the-worker day.

04:11.852 --> 04:15.122
You know, what if
we run into Mrs. Tate?

04:15.155 --> 04:17.491
You know, the lumber
lord Tates or that Barnes

04:17.525 --> 04:19.159
guy that heads the whole
chain of supermarkets?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.594
Yeah.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.029
And his gold digger wife.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.665
I'm sure she'll be there
because it's an open bar.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.100
Roseanne, you know
what, oh, my god.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.201
What?

04:28.235 --> 04:31.705
We might be able to
meet the poultry king.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.977
Relax, Jackie.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.078
He's just like us.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.481
He puts his jacket on
one wing at a time.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.557
Hello.

04:49.590 --> 04:52.225
I'm Billington Frezman, the
membership committee chairman.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.162
Welcome to the
Lanford Country Club.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.731
I'm so glad you could make
it today, Mrs. Conner.

04:57.765 --> 04:59.933
Oh, well, thank
you, Billington.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.202
Let me introduce you
to my sister, Jackie.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.103
Hello.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.405
That's nice.

05:04.438 --> 05:08.075
Let me tell you, if I may,
about all of our facilities.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.010
In addition to our
18-hole golf course,

05:10.043 --> 05:13.681
we have four tennis courts
with lights for night playing.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.517
We have an indoor,
Olympic-sized swimming

05:16.550 --> 05:23.056
pool, and a fully-equipped
exercise room or so I'm told.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.594
In addition, we have Lanford's
finest gourmet restaurant.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.095
They cater all of our lunches.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.129
So what?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.664
You get a free case
of veal every time

05:30.698 --> 05:31.699
you sign up a new member?

05:31.732 --> 05:33.033
[laughter]

05:33.066 --> 05:35.403
Well, my sister is quite
the kidder, you know?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.537
I say--

05:36.570 --> 05:39.006
Enjoy everything you
get in the Wellman Room.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.442
Wellman room.

05:41.475 --> 05:45.112
Jeez, after all those years of
slaving away in this factory,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.948
now we have to eat in a
room that has his name.

05:47.981 --> 05:50.484
And look, the old man is going
to be looking at us all night.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.754
To this day, I cannot
look up at the old

05:53.787 --> 05:54.922
Wellman place on
the hill without

05:54.955 --> 05:56.256
chills running down my spine.

05:56.289 --> 05:57.858
Remember when we
were little and we

05:57.891 --> 06:00.127
used to say that all the shadows
up there were the ghosts of all

06:00.160 --> 06:01.495
the children who disappeared?

06:01.529 --> 06:04.898
That's is because that is what
happened to the Crane twins.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.900
They went in that house,
and they never came out.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.235
Ow.

06:08.268 --> 06:09.202
Jackie, come on.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.370
They moved to Scottsdale.

06:10.404 --> 06:11.405
Yeah.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.440
Sure they did.

06:15.342 --> 06:18.612
[laughter]

06:18.646 --> 06:20.948
That's Mrs. Barnes over there.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.516
Look, she's totally smashed.

06:22.550 --> 06:25.419
So I made His Royal
Highness buy me a mink

06:25.453 --> 06:29.957
coat to make up for getting
me the wrong, stinking Cartier

06:29.990 --> 06:31.158
watch.

06:31.191 --> 06:34.462
Didn't I?

06:34.495 --> 06:39.266
I guess she's not going to
be donating any blood today.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.034
Excuse me.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.170
Excuse me, ladies.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.038
Aren't you Jackie Harris?

06:45.072 --> 06:46.406
Jackie Harris, yes.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.841
I'm Jackie Harris.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.843
I thought so.

06:49.877 --> 06:53.246
You and her are the ones that
used to steal the golf balls.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.616
We'll be moving on.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.150
Hello.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.619
I am Mrs. Jack Tate.

06:58.652 --> 07:00.588
Jack Tate, as in
the Lumber Lord Tates.

07:00.621 --> 07:03.524
I am so happy to meet you.

07:03.557 --> 07:06.527
I've been following the
news of your good fortune.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.997
You see, I'm not just
Mrs. Lumber Lord,

07:10.030 --> 07:13.634
I am also chairman of the
Committee for Moral Decency.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.370
You see, we've been working
very hard to stop Ebonics

07:17.404 --> 07:18.472
from infecting our schools.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.540
Why?

07:19.573 --> 07:23.210
That's a one shot my
son has a bilingual.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.246
Well, hopefully we, can
count on your support.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.081
I'm sorry, but
my charity dollars

07:28.115 --> 07:30.484
are already earmarked for
bailing out deathrow records.

07:33.654 --> 07:34.555
Oh.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.623
Please.

07:35.656 --> 07:37.991
Oh, jeez, here I go.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.293
I'm so sorry.
- That's all right.

07:40.327 --> 07:44.397
Mrs. Barnes has been slamming
into me all afternoon anyway.

07:44.431 --> 07:45.966
Enjoying the party, are we?

07:45.999 --> 07:46.867
Oh, yeah.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.001
Oh, we sure are.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.971
Well, good to see you
dressed up for it, huh?

07:51.004 --> 07:52.773
Nice T-shirt there.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.474
- The Gap.
- Oh, yeah.

07:54.508 --> 07:55.375
Me too.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.476
(TOGETHER) Sharon Stone.

07:56.510 --> 07:58.712
Yeah.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.480
Wow, this is some shindig.

08:00.514 --> 08:01.549
Even the mayor is here.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.449
Oh, my god.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.416
There is the mayor.

08:03.450 --> 08:04.685
And he's coming over here.
- Yeah.

08:04.718 --> 08:06.119
Why don't you tell
him you voted for him.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.020
I'm sure he'll love that.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.021
Hello, Edgar.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.422
I haven't seen you
in quite a while.

08:09.456 --> 08:10.624
Mayor.

08:10.658 --> 08:13.627
Well, I just had to come
over here and meet one

08:13.661 --> 08:14.662
of Lanford's leading citizens.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.563
Oh, no.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.864
Actually you have met me before.

08:16.897 --> 08:17.831
Remember?

08:17.865 --> 08:21.034
You came to my
house selling Amway.

08:21.068 --> 08:26.139
I was there just helping out
the wife on that one, you know?

08:26.173 --> 08:29.977
You know, for a campaign
contribution of $10,000

08:30.010 --> 08:32.012
or more, I can
arrange it so that you

08:32.045 --> 08:36.316
can sit three seats from
the podium, just three,

08:36.349 --> 08:37.250
at the city council.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.919
Could you say
that again, mayor?

08:38.952 --> 08:42.823
This little microphone doesn't
pick up everything real easy.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.425
Well, Willy.

08:45.458 --> 08:48.095
You know, that there
is a hardworking man.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.230
He even stuffs his
on ballot boxes.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.599
Here.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.499
Cheers.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.901
Thank you.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.036
Well, you know, this town just
doesn't seem the same to me,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.438
but then you know, I've been
gone for a while, traveling.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.506
Oh, traveling.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.407
Yes.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.109
We've been traveling abroad.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.077
We have been to New York.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.045
New York.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.580
--City.

09:06.614 --> 09:09.516
We were studying the
caste system, you know,

09:09.549 --> 09:10.550
over there in India.

09:10.584 --> 09:11.484
Ah-huh.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.886
Oh, yeah.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.691
They got a terrible,
terrible problem over there.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.760
And it's so hard
to find good help.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.161
Isn't it though?
Yeah.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.362
Yeah.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.931
So what do you think of
our little clubhouse here?

09:23.964 --> 09:27.200
Well, it's not too shabby,
except for the picture old man

09:27.234 --> 09:28.936
Wellman hanging over there.

09:28.969 --> 09:34.507
Look at that, that kind
of inbred ferret face,

09:34.541 --> 09:38.646
kind of beady-eyed,
veiny nose, hairy eared,

09:38.679 --> 09:39.847
kind of a bag of nickels.

09:42.650 --> 09:43.751
Bag of nickels.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.018
I just made that up.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.920
I can't.

09:46.954 --> 09:49.623
How could anybody stare at him
long enough to paint a picture?

09:49.657 --> 09:53.360
Hey, how would you like
to meet one of his kids?

09:53.393 --> 09:55.562
No, they're not allowed
to go out during the day.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.498
They can't be in the sun.

09:58.531 --> 10:00.868
Well, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

10:00.901 --> 10:11.945
I'm Edgar Wellman, Jr.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.513
EDGAR: Hey, It's all right.

10:13.546 --> 10:14.547
It's all right, ladies.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.448
It's preshrunk.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.250
I'm fine.
I swear.

10:17.284 --> 10:18.318
Sit down.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.855
I can't believe you're
Edgar Wellman, Jr.

10:21.889 --> 10:22.990
Yes, ma'am.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.225
I hope that doesn't ruin
your whole afternoon.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.094
Well, we just--

10:27.127 --> 10:28.428
you know, we--

10:28.461 --> 10:29.763
Hey, it's all right.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.031
Hey, calm down.
You know?

10:31.064 --> 10:32.165
Don't worry about it.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.834
It's not like I haven't
heard this stuff before.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.869
OK.
But I'm Jackie Harris.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.070
This is my sister,
Roseanne Conner.

10:37.104 --> 10:37.971
Yeah.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.873
Hi.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.874
What are you doing here?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.242
I thought you'd be
like sailing boats

10:42.275 --> 10:46.079
over in Europe or racing cars
in Monte Carlo or something.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.214
No, that's my brother.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.882
Oh so you're the one
that had his graduation

10:48.916 --> 10:50.450
party on the Concorde.
- No.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.052
No.
That's my sister.

10:52.085 --> 10:56.189
Actually, it's my other brother,
but he thinks he's my sister.

10:56.223 --> 10:58.158
Oh, god.

10:58.191 --> 11:00.193
Well, that must have made
your dad's head spin.

11:00.227 --> 11:01.394
No, not really.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.296
I was the black
sheep in the family.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.265
I was the Wellman they
never talked about.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.834
You know what?

11:06.867 --> 11:08.668
Me and my sister,
we used to work

11:08.702 --> 11:11.438
at Wellman Plastics Factory.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.807
And I mean, not even a day
goes by where I don't hear

11:13.841 --> 11:15.976
your dad's motivational
speeches that used

11:16.009 --> 11:17.177
to blare over the loudspeaker.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.113
Concentration on work
makes you a better person.

11:20.147 --> 11:23.016
My favorite, spot
and eliminate hazards.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.953
We had the same announcements
in the house, only my father

11:25.986 --> 11:28.588
called them bed-time stories.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.490
He was trying to groom
me for corporate life,

11:30.523 --> 11:31.691
but I just couldn't do that.

11:31.725 --> 11:32.726
I quit.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.461
He wasn't the easy
a guy to live with.

11:34.494 --> 11:37.264
Well, he wasn't the easiest
guy to work for either.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.900
You're the woman my
mother used to call Roxanne.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.969
Yeah, you're the one
that kind of stirred up

11:42.002 --> 11:44.171
all the trouble at the factory.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.638
Over what?

11:45.672 --> 11:47.875
Extras stall in the
ladies rooms, was it?

11:47.908 --> 11:49.242
No.

11:49.276 --> 11:54.481
No, it was actually about having
to meet unrealistic quotas.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.649
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

11:56.683 --> 11:58.786
We had a deal.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.420
You sound angry, Roseanne.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.055
You told me if
I towed the line,

12:02.089 --> 12:03.190
that you'd drop the quotas.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.424
Why are you doing this?

12:04.457 --> 12:05.658
Because I can.

12:05.692 --> 12:06.960
No, you can't.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.595
I did.

12:08.628 --> 12:09.863
And when I broke
you, I knew you were

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
just like the rest of them.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.834
And you'll stay and
you will do your 8,000

12:13.867 --> 12:16.970
and so will your loser
friends, or they're gone.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.339
Well, this is ain't
way you motivate people.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.975
And you know what, any
manager would know that.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.277
And you are a lot of things,
but you ain't no manager.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.914
Sweetheart, you just bought
yourself a bunch of trouble.

12:26.947 --> 12:27.815
No, sweetheart.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.715
You did.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.717
Hey, I'm not done with you.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.221
Don't you walk away
when I'm talking to you.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.156
Well, I hear you
nearly caused a riot.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.557
No.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.393
The only noise we made was the
sound of our sneakers squeaking

12:40.427 --> 12:43.730
on the floor as we left.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.834
- You OK, Sis?
- No.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.301
I'm not OK.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.839
I mean, I tried to be OK, but
he doesn't want me to be OK.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.206
He doesn't want
any of us to be OK.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.107
You know why?

12:54.141 --> 12:55.275
Because he's not OK.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.476
OK?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.778
Roseanne, I told you
not to walk away from me.

12:58.812 --> 13:00.613
I'm walking away
from you, Faber,

13:00.647 --> 13:02.349
and I'm walking away
this stinking factory.

13:02.382 --> 13:05.853
I'm walking away
from this lousy job.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.356
Well, that was a wonderful
performance, Roseanne.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.559
May I point out there are
two doors to this room, one

13:12.592 --> 13:14.561
that pays and one that doesn't.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.599
I guess we're
not going to make

13:52.632 --> 13:53.700
our quota today, honey bunch.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.473
So I bet you think
I'm a real shrew, huh?

14:00.507 --> 14:01.641
No.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.912
I think you're quite
unique, so did my father.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.746
Although he didn't
exactly put it that way.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.019
No, the walkout
was the beginning

14:12.052 --> 14:14.387
and the end for the old man.

14:14.421 --> 14:17.657
He just didn't have the
concept of talking to labor.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.059
Actually, I think
it's common sense,

14:19.092 --> 14:21.995
but he didn't like
anything common.

14:22.029 --> 14:25.198
So you just grew up coming to
places like this every weekend.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.233
Well, yeah.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.035
He'd bring me here
to network with all

14:28.068 --> 14:29.970
the well-connected kids.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.173
I just wanted to come here
and swim in the club pool.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.874
You should have
come swimming with us.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.143
We swam down at the quarry.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.645
Well, my dad would
never let me swim there.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.314
No, he was afraid
I'd catch something.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.316
Like poverty.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.486
Why didn't you just have your
dad buy the quarry for you?

14:46.519 --> 14:49.056
Actually, he already own it.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.024
So after that, I
grew my hair long,

14:51.058 --> 14:52.592
got kicked out of this club.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.894
Get out of here.

14:54.928 --> 14:57.330
That's how I lost
that fry cook job.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.400
Fry cook job, I did that too.

15:00.433 --> 15:01.901
But that was right
after they cut me off,

15:01.935 --> 15:05.338
so I split, started traveling.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.874
I did odd jobs, paid
my own way, and then I

15:07.907 --> 15:09.776
ended up a year in an ashram.

15:09.809 --> 15:13.646
You mean, you slept on the
floor and chanted all day long?

15:13.680 --> 15:16.283
I was searching
for my deepest truth.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.185
At least that's
what the guru said.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.454
I bet he was sitting in
what, a $5,000 leather chair

15:21.488 --> 15:24.024
when he said that to you.

15:24.057 --> 15:29.062
So you've been staying
up there in that big house

15:29.096 --> 15:30.097
on the hill up there?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.464
Yeah.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.500
You know, if you guys aren't
doing anything after this deal,

15:33.533 --> 15:36.669
why don't you come on up
and check out the mansion.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.739
You know, I know you've
heard all the weird stories.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.408
Oh, come on.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.909
Only idiots believe that.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.978
We'd love to go up there.

15:45.012 --> 15:46.646
Oh, that's great.

15:46.679 --> 15:47.847
All right.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.449
Listen, I'll have the
valet bring my car around.

15:49.482 --> 15:53.353
I'll meet you right in
front in two minutes.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.355
Jeez, he is so handsome.

15:55.388 --> 15:56.256
Isn't he so handsome?

15:56.289 --> 15:57.357
I can't believe it.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.892
I mean, it's amazing
that a guy his age like

15:59.926 --> 16:01.461
is in still that
kind of a shape.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.296
You never see guys like
that around Lanford.

16:03.330 --> 16:07.967
We are not going up to
that old house on the hill.

16:08.001 --> 16:11.004
There's dungeons in there.

16:11.038 --> 16:14.774
There is nothing wrong with
that house, and you know it.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.644
Maybe, maybe not.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.247
It's just like
stories that kids used

16:20.280 --> 16:21.781
to tell when we were little.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.350
You know, like how
all the kids said

16:23.383 --> 16:27.554
that my mom was an evil serpent
from the dark nether world.

16:36.796 --> 16:39.966
And I hope you don't mind
the house is a little quiet.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.468
I gave the help the day off.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.835
Hey, that's a good idea.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.272
We used to be the help,
and we were terrible.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.873
Does anyone feel a chill?

16:46.906 --> 16:49.542
Well, these big mansions
are kind of hard to heat.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.744
How about I give you the tour.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.845
I'll show you the
basement first.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.681
Huh?
- (TOGETHER) No.

16:54.714 --> 16:55.882
Oh, come on.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.016
Come on.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.918
I want you to get the
feeling of the dungeon.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.287
It's right behind this door.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.188
Huh?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.455
No.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.624
We're really fine right
where we are here.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.459
And we're not nosy people.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.695
That's too bad.

17:08.728 --> 17:11.531
I thought you might enjoy
meeting the Crane twins.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.400
Boo.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.467
I got you.

17:14.501 --> 17:15.368
Come on.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.236
I'll make us some coffee.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.275
Boy.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.145
Well, this really is a
beautiful, old house.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.813
Is this what brought
you back to Lanford?

17:26.846 --> 17:27.714
No.

17:27.747 --> 17:29.116
I came back to sell the factory.

17:29.149 --> 17:32.885
My two brothers ran it into the
ground after my father died.

17:32.919 --> 17:35.655
No, I was left with
a mountain of bills

17:35.688 --> 17:37.924
and a steamed IRS
guy named Mitch.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.093
That's horrible.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.195
If I would've known that
your family was just bleeding

17:42.229 --> 17:44.164
the place dry, I would
have padded my time

17:44.197 --> 17:45.965
card way more than I did.

17:45.998 --> 17:48.034
Well, that's not
the least of it.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.202
I mean, they're
letting the factory

17:49.236 --> 17:50.970
workers all go next week.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.472
And the two foreign
conglomerates

17:52.505 --> 17:56.376
that are interested,
they only want the land.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.011
You know, Roseanne, I got
to admit that, you know,

17:59.045 --> 18:02.115
I didn't just accidentally
run into you today.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.683
I guess you guessed by now.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.318
I wouldn't go to
that country club.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.253
No, I wanted to you.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.987
I need your help.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.723
I think the other
shoe just dropped.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.559
Well, we're really
not in the market

18:12.592 --> 18:16.062
to buy a plastics factory,
if that's what you thinking.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.299
Well, I mean, I just need
enough dough to covered

18:19.332 --> 18:21.868
the bank and keep
the doors open,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.836
otherwise this town is going
to have to learn to eat

18:23.870 --> 18:25.672
a lot of sushi or falafel.

18:25.705 --> 18:29.209
Well, how come you can't
just sell it to the Italians?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.312
I just don't think that
that's going to work, Edgar.

18:32.345 --> 18:36.316
Oh, well, you know, I'm
sorry I brought this up.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.050
How about a biscotti?

18:42.622 --> 18:46.092
Well, how much
money do you need?

18:46.125 --> 18:49.229
Just enough to keep the
bank off our back, you know?

18:49.262 --> 18:51.198
Keep the doors open.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.865
Well, the lawyer said
it was something just

18:52.899 --> 18:54.501
over a million bucks, but
I don't know if that's

18:54.534 --> 18:55.902
before or after their fees.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.036
I don't know.

18:57.069 --> 19:00.173
Maybe there is something
we could do, Roseanne.

19:00.207 --> 19:02.875
We are, like they say,
kind of flush right now.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.010
Yeah.

19:04.043 --> 19:05.345
But I mean, what good
does it do if everybody

19:05.378 --> 19:07.514
gets laid off in a year anyway?

19:07.547 --> 19:09.882
I mean, it's not going
to be easy like just

19:09.916 --> 19:13.853
turning the diner over
to Nancy and Leon.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.054
What are you
guys talking about?

19:15.087 --> 19:16.189
What diner?

19:16.223 --> 19:18.391
Well, we own this
diner, you know.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.460
And then we turned it over to
the people who worked there.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.028
Well, why couldn't you
do something like that

19:22.061 --> 19:24.197
though with the factory?

19:24.231 --> 19:26.866
You know, like that
airline did, like the guy

19:26.899 --> 19:29.736
that you had your baggage
to says, hello, there ma'am.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.070
I'm an owner.
See?

19:31.103 --> 19:33.806
Because then the
employees care more, which

19:33.840 --> 19:35.475
means that they work
harder, and then

19:35.508 --> 19:37.076
that makes a business better.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.077
Well, yeah.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.479
I mean if we would
have owned a piece

19:39.512 --> 19:42.215
of Wellman's we definitely
would have worked harder.

19:42.249 --> 19:46.553
And I definitely would not have
ripped off the candy machines.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.488
Like an employee buy out.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.758
That's not a bad idea.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.060
Well, yeah.

19:54.093 --> 19:57.564
I mean, you know,
we might as well.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.800
What good is having all this
money if all your friends

20:00.833 --> 20:02.902
around you are poor.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.737
First thing
Monday morning, I'll

20:04.771 --> 20:06.172
get the lawyer on the phone.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.240
He'll call the bank.

20:07.274 --> 20:10.142
And then we'll get
a lawyer, and we'll

20:10.176 --> 20:11.944
get him to call up some banker.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.913
And then that banker
can call your lawyer

20:13.946 --> 20:15.014
who'll call your banker.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.416
And then your banker
can call up a doctor,

20:16.449 --> 20:19.419
and we'll get a second opinion.

20:19.452 --> 20:23.055
Who ever thought that we would
be teamed up with a Wellman?

20:23.089 --> 20:26.459
Well, you can't judge people
by where they come from.

20:26.493 --> 20:29.462
Money is the reflection
of its possessor.

20:29.496 --> 20:31.831
Where did you learn
that, in the ashram there?

20:31.864 --> 20:32.665
Huh?

20:36.202 --> 20:39.639
Well, I have to tell you that
I learned something here.

20:39.672 --> 20:40.973
You know.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.643
Because well, the way we were
raised, me and my sister,

20:43.676 --> 20:45.945
you know, living hand
to mouth and everything,

20:45.978 --> 20:47.347
we never even thought
that there could

20:47.380 --> 20:53.353
be any rich people who even had
the slightest clue about life.

20:53.386 --> 20:55.021
It's just good to
know that, you know,

20:55.054 --> 20:58.925
you're really a decent guy.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.693
You're just really, really cool.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.128
That's a good thing
for me to learn.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.195
Well, thanks, Roseanne.

21:03.229 --> 21:05.097
And that means a lot to me.

21:05.131 --> 21:07.166
Yeah, I realized
something else too.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.067
Yeah?

21:08.100 --> 21:08.968
What's that?

21:09.001 --> 21:09.869
God, you're gorgeous.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.855
Ah!

21:28.888 --> 21:30.957
Ah!

21:30.990 --> 21:31.791
(TOGETHER) Ah!

21:35.194 --> 21:36.963
Ah!

21:36.996 --> 21:39.065
Ah!

21:39.098 --> 21:39.866
Ah!

21:43.269 --> 21:44.070
Ah!

21:47.774 --> 21:49.241
Ah!
