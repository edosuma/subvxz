Uh, it's Buster Moon
from the New Moon Theater.

22:32.303 --> 22:34.706
And we're very excited to share
our story with you today, sir.

22:34.739 --> 22:36.074
Right, guys?

22:36.107 --> 22:38.276
Yeah, great. Now, get to it.

22:38.309 --> 22:39.144
Of course. Yes.

(drumbeat intro

22:44.014 --> 22:45.350

of an ordinary high school girl
who discovers...

- (buzzer blares)
- Stop.

22:49.521 --> 22:50.522

- Never. Never.
- Where the heck did you

22:58.129 --> 22:59.330
dig these guys up from, huh?

22:59.364 --> 23:00.698
If you could all leave
very quickly,

23:00.732 --> 23:02.100
we'd appreciate that, please.

23:02.133 --> 23:04.102
I need big shows, Jerry.

23:04.135 --> 23:06.104
- Big ideas!
- Yes, sir, big. The biggest.

23:06.137 --> 23:08.072
Hey, I have a big one.

23:09.006 --> 23:10.974
Okay, honey. Come on, let's go.

23:11.008 --> 23:12.677
You know, the sci-fi musical.

23:12.710 --> 23:14.712
- That's big, right?
- Um, uh...

23:14.746 --> 23:17.115
GUNTER: I mean, it's got
the aliens and the robots

23:17.148 --> 23:19.484
and the lasers
and these amazing songs

23:19.517 --> 23:21.219
from, like, Clay Calloway to...

23:21.252 --> 23:23.688
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Clay Calloway?

23:23.721 --> 23:25.557

I love Clay Calloway.

23:26.424 --> 23:27.625
I know, right?

23:27.659 --> 23:29.060
I mean, doesn't everybody?

23:29.093 --> 23:30.462
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
See, Jerry?

23:30.495 --> 23:33.198
This is exactly the kind
of big idea I'm talking about.

23:33.231 --> 23:34.766

23:34.799 --> 23:36.568

23:36.601 --> 23:38.770

you want to... (splutters)

Oh, my...

Not now.

24:34.792 --> 24:36.160
Moon, how did you get in here?

24:36.194 --> 24:37.362
Hey, he said not now. Psst.

24:37.395 --> 24:39.197
Yeah, I heard him.
Thanks, Jerry.

24:39.230 --> 24:40.732
Are you telling me you-you got

24:40.765 --> 24:42.767
Clay Calloway's permission
to use his song?

24:42.800 --> 24:45.436
- Well, what if I told you I did?
- Ah.

24:45.470 --> 24:46.437
Okay, so what, you got

24:46.471 --> 24:48.339
some kind of personal connection
to this guy?

24:48.373 --> 24:50.675

- Moon!

24:50.708 --> 24:52.310
Wait, if you know him,

24:52.343 --> 24:56.281
then you could get him
in the show, right?

24:57.415 --> 24:59.384
(chuckles):
Oh, that'd be huge for me.

24:59.417 --> 25:00.785
Huge.

25:00.818 --> 25:02.420
Sir, I'm sorry, but seriously?

25:02.453 --> 25:04.856
You think this little guy
from nowhere

25:04.889 --> 25:07.592
can get Clay Calloway
in the show?

25:09.394 --> 25:11.462
Well, Suki,
for your information,

25:11.496 --> 25:15.099
I am not just
a little guy from nowhere.

25:15.133 --> 25:16.834
Consider it done, sir.

25:16.868 --> 25:18.570
I'll give you three weeks, Moon.

25:18.603 --> 25:21.239
Three weeks to get this show
up and running, okay?

25:21.272 --> 25:22.840
Yes, sir. Thank you.

25:22.874 --> 25:24.576
Moon, do you really know
Clay Calloway?

25:24.609 --> 25:25.710
Shh, shh. Not now.

to start work right away.

25:29.647 --> 25:32.317

our dancers, whatever they need.

25:32.350 --> 25:34.385

The whole shaboodle.

25:36.754 --> 25:37.855

25:37.889 --> 25:39.357
Uh, hey, one last thing.

25:39.390 --> 25:41.492
Don't you ever do nothing
to make me look bad.

25:41.526 --> 25:42.860
You got that?

25:42.894 --> 25:44.495
Oh, I will never
let that happen, sir.

25:44.529 --> 25:46.731
You better not,
or I'll throw you off the roof.

25:46.764 --> 25:48.800

May I have everyone's

29:31.722 --> 29:33.558
Thank you. Yes.

29:33.591 --> 29:36.427
Okay, um, on behalf
of myself and the cast,

29:36.460 --> 29:37.829
I just want to say that

29:37.862 --> 29:39.964
to be given
this incredible opportunity

29:39.997 --> 29:42.600
to work with you all here
at the Crystal Tower Theater,

29:42.633 --> 29:44.535
well, it's an honor
for all of us.

29:44.569 --> 29:46.838
And I believe that, together,
we can make a show

29:46.871 --> 29:48.906
that'll take the audience
out of this world.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.375

to make this model.

29:55.479 --> 29:56.881
Great work, Steve.

29:56.914 --> 29:58.916

30:03.921 --> 30:05.489
(gasps) The lead role?

30:05.523 --> 30:07.625
Trust me,
you are perfect for it.

30:07.658 --> 30:09.493
(cheering, excited chatter)

30:09.527 --> 30:11.129
Wait till my kids
hear about this.

30:11.163 --> 30:13.131
And so the story goes like this.

30:13.165 --> 30:15.466
Rosita plays
an astronaut searching

30:15.499 --> 30:17.501
for a missing space explorer.

30:17.535 --> 30:19.470

across four planets.

30:23.641 --> 30:26.111
There's a planet of war,
a planet of love,

30:26.144 --> 30:28.146
a one of despair and one of joy.

30:28.180 --> 30:31.515
And each planet will have its
own spectacular musical number

30:31.549 --> 30:34.152
- performed by one of our terrific cast.

30:34.186 --> 30:36.587
A-And how does it end?
Do I find the explorer?

30:36.621 --> 30:39.157
Oh, we have no clue what
we're going to do at the end.

30:39.191 --> 30:40.725
Gunter, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:40.758 --> 30:43.494
We do have great ideas
for the ending.

30:43.527 --> 30:44.962
We just... All right.

30:44.996 --> 30:47.099
We've only got three weeks
to make this reality, folks.

30:47.132 --> 30:48.499
Let's get to work.

30:48.532 --> 30:50.568
Johnny, you are gonna play

30:50.601 --> 30:53.037
an alien warrior
in a fantastic battle scene.

30:53.071 --> 30:54.872
- Yes!
- Come with me.

("Lite Spots" by Kaytranada

Johnny, I want you to meet

31:04.682 --> 31:06.817
- Hello, lads.
- Hey, how you doing?

31:06.851 --> 31:08.819
Uh, wait. You said
mine was a battle scene.

31:08.853 --> 31:12.090
Well, it is, but Gunter saw it
as more of a... a dance battle.

31:12.124 --> 31:14.059
- Yeah!
- Okay...

31:14.092 --> 31:15.960
Johnny, don't worry.
You're gonna be working with

31:15.993 --> 31:18.196
the number one choreographer
in Redshore City.

31:18.230 --> 31:21.499
JOHNNY:
"Klaus Kickenklober."

31:21.532 --> 31:23.768
Yep. Klaus will turn you
into a pro in no time.

Meena, you okay?

31:28.706 --> 31:32.510
Gunter said I'm in
a romantic scene and, uh, uh...

31:32.543 --> 31:34.545
(whispers):
I have to kiss someone.

31:34.578 --> 31:36.214
Yeah.
It's gonna be an amazing,

31:36.248 --> 31:37.949
beautiful, romantic scene.

Mr. Moon, I've never even had

31:39.750 --> 31:41.519

31:41.552 --> 31:42.787
Ah, don't you worry.

Mr. Moon, we're ready
to start building

31:50.628 --> 31:51.963
Okay, okay, okay, listen.

(hushed): I don't exactly know
what they are yet,

31:53.965 --> 31:56.901
so could you give me one more
night to figure this out?

31:56.934 --> 31:59.003

doesn't have it figured out,

31:59.036 --> 32:00.972

figured out.

guiding them all the way
back home again.

expecting you till the morning.

wait to see you.

my dream come true.

32:53.924 --> 32:55.160

32:57.862 --> 33:00.598
- Clay Calloway?
- Yeah. I found his home address.

33:00.631 --> 33:02.267
- (Buster cheers)
- No way.

33:02.300 --> 33:03.768

33:05.270 --> 33:06.804
to go visit him
first thing tomorrow.

33:06.837 --> 33:08.672
- Oh, yes, sir.
- You'll need to rent a car

33:08.706 --> 33:11.042
and take him a letter and, uh,
maybe that fruit basket.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.144
Yes, the fruit basket.

38:31.296 --> 38:33.631
I can't take your call
right now,

38:33.665 --> 38:37.102
but please leave me a message
after the beep.

38:37.135 --> 38:38.636

38:38.670 --> 38:40.305
Miss Crawly, it's me, Mr. Moon.

38:40.338 --> 38:42.107
I haven't heard from you
in a while.

38:42.140 --> 38:43.508
I'm starting to worry here.

What?

38:52.317 --> 38:54.686
(laughs)
I'm just messing with you.

38:54.719 --> 38:56.987
Where's your sense of humor,
huh?

38:57.020 --> 38:58.223
(chuckles nervously)

38:58.256 --> 39:00.392
Anyway, this is
my daughter Porsha.

39:00.425 --> 39:01.659
Hey.

39:01.693 --> 39:03.294
Nice to meet you, Porsha.

39:03.328 --> 39:05.296
She wants to meet Calloway.
Big fan, aren't you, baby?

39:05.330 --> 39:08.199
Oh, my gosh, I'm, like,
so into vintage right now.

39:08.233 --> 39:09.467
So, where is he?

39:09.501 --> 39:11.269
Uh, well...

39:11.302 --> 39:13.971
I-I'm not expecting Clay
on set just yet.

39:14.004 --> 39:15.407
- I mean...
- PORSHA: Wait.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.007
Is this, like, a sky-fi show?

39:17.040 --> 39:19.544
Uh, sci-fi? Yes. Yes, it is.

Thank you, Sasha. We, uh...

39:27.385 --> 39:29.287
We're gonna rehearse,
Mr. Crystal, so...

39:29.320 --> 39:31.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You go
and do your rehearsing thing.

Okay, yeah. (exhales sharply)

47:44.182 --> 47:46.484
Wait, if you're in a real show,

47:46.517 --> 47:47.985
how come you don't have
a choreographer?

47:48.019 --> 47:50.788
I do, but it turns out
he's a massive weirdo.

47:50.821 --> 47:54.226
(scoffs) And how do I know
that you're not a weirdo?

47:54.259 --> 47:56.694
Hmm? How do I know
that you're legit?

47:56.727 --> 47:58.230
Well, just come with me to
rehearsals. See for yourself.

47:58.263 --> 48:00.598
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not just gonna follow

48:00.631 --> 48:02.767
some guy I don't know
to rehearsals.

48:02.800 --> 48:05.703
Well, how else am I supposed
to prove that I'm legit?

Ah, it's all right.
She's with me.

Pleased to meet you.
I'm Nooshy.

48:56.821 --> 48:58.990
I'm his dance coach.
And I really love that hat.

48:59.023 --> 49:01.159
She's right. Great hat.

49:01.193 --> 49:02.660
(chuckles)

49:02.693 --> 49:05.963
You think some riffraff
street dancer

49:05.997 --> 49:07.232
can help you more than me?

49:07.265 --> 49:08.866
- Riffraff?
- Okay, okay. Hang on.

49:08.899 --> 49:10.634
She's just gonna give me
some extra lessons, that's all.

49:10.668 --> 49:13.604
Oh, because I,
Klaus Kickenklober,

49:13.637 --> 49:17.008
master choreographer,
am not good enough for Johnny.

49:17.041 --> 49:20.145
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Yes, I'm irrelevant to him.

49:20.178 --> 49:22.880
I'm just a stupid,
fat, old monkey.

49:22.913 --> 49:24.749
- I don't think that at all.
- I do.

49:24.782 --> 49:26.218
JOHNNY:
Shh! Please.

49:26.251 --> 49:27.885
She's only trying
to help me, that's all.

49:27.918 --> 49:30.088
Dude, anyway, I only need
two days with him.

49:30.122 --> 49:32.057
Two days? Ha!

49:32.090 --> 49:33.724
200 years, more like.

Two days. He'll be amazing.

- This place is incredible.
- (chuckles)

51:24.236 --> 51:26.036
Pretty great, huh?

51:26.071 --> 51:28.206
So, how's it going
with Calloway?

51:28.240 --> 51:30.040
Calloway?

51:30.075 --> 51:31.909
It's, uh... it's good.

51:31.942 --> 51:34.812
- Yeah. Very good.
- Right, right.

51:34.845 --> 51:36.181
Well, let me ask you something.

51:36.214 --> 51:38.883
What did I do to make you
disrespect me, huh?

51:38.916 --> 51:39.683
What?

51:39.717 --> 51:41.219
Oh, what?
You think I'm an idiot?

51:41.253 --> 51:42.753
Some kind of bozo?

51:42.786 --> 51:44.755
No. No, sir, not at all.

51:44.788 --> 51:48.193
My team, they talked
to Calloway's lawyer,

51:48.226 --> 51:52.397
and they say he's never
heard of you or your show.

51:52.430 --> 51:54.732
Really? They said that? Uh...

51:54.765 --> 51:56.734
- You lied to me!
- (gasps) I-I didn't mean to.

51:56.767 --> 51:58.969
Okay? Honestly, I really
thought I could get him.

51:59.003 --> 52:01.106
No one makes me look
like a fool! No one!

52:01.139 --> 52:03.108
- I-I wouldn't dream of doing that to you.
- (growling)

52:03.141 --> 52:05.310
I swear, if you didn't have
my kid in your show,

52:05.343 --> 52:07.044
you'd be out
of that window by now!

52:07.078 --> 52:08.779
Please, please, please.
I-I'm so sorry.

52:08.812 --> 52:10.415
You'd better have Calloway
by the end of next week,

52:10.448 --> 52:12.450
- or so help me! (growls)
- I-I-I will.

52:12.484 --> 52:15.453
I-I-I'll get him.
I won't let you down, sir.

52:15.487 --> 52:19.090
Oh, I know
you won't let me down.

- Yes, sir. Right here, sir.

52:21.493 --> 52:24.028
- Clean this mess up, will you?
- Yes, absolutely, I'd love to.

52:25.096 --> 52:26.830
Listen up.
I got to go to Calloway's,

52:26.864 --> 52:28.400
and I got to go ASAP.

52:28.433 --> 52:30.202
- Oh, no, please don't go there.
- D-Don't worry. Don't worry.

52:30.235 --> 52:32.337
I know you said he's crazy,
but I'll be all right.

52:32.370 --> 52:34.439
- Oh, can I go with you, please?
- Uh, I don't know.

52:34.472 --> 52:35.940
Come on, you're gonna need me.

52:35.973 --> 52:37.741
I know everything
about this guy.

52:37.775 --> 52:39.977
- Uh... I think you're right.
- Yes!

52:40.010 --> 52:41.946
Now, listen, Gunter,
you've got to figure out

52:41.979 --> 52:43.515
the ending of this show
on your own.

52:43.548 --> 52:45.217
- On my own?
- Yes.

52:45.250 --> 52:47.485
Miss Crawly, I need you
to take charge while I'm away.

52:47.519 --> 52:49.019
- Yes, sir.
- Now, listen to me.

52:49.054 --> 52:50.888
You got to bring
your A game here, Miss Crawly.

52:50.921 --> 52:52.224
I'm serious.
You got to be tough.

52:52.257 --> 52:54.459
- Yes, I got to be tough.
- You got to be firm.

52:54.492 --> 52:55.960
Oh, and I got to be firm. Yes.

52:55.993 --> 52:57.828
And you cannot...
I repeat, cannot...

52:57.861 --> 52:59.830
let production fall behind,
not one little bit.

52:59.863 --> 53:00.965
Is that clear?

53:00.998 --> 53:02.833
Yes, sir, Mr. Moon, sir.

53:02.866 --> 53:05.070
(military drumbeat playing)

53:09.873 --> 53:11.243

finished yesterday!

- You better be!

53:15.946 --> 53:18.316
Meena, Darius,
take it from the top,

53:18.350 --> 53:21.253
and this time, put a little
juice in it, will you?

53:21.286 --> 53:23.521
I'm trying my best, Miss Crawly.

53:23.555 --> 53:25.523
A little juice?

53:25.557 --> 53:27.925
Hey, everybody.

53:30.562 --> 53:32.896
You're two hours late
for rehearsal!

53:32.930 --> 53:35.267
Wait. Wait, where's the koala?

53:35.300 --> 53:36.434
Who are you?

53:36.468 --> 53:38.002
I'm in charge! That's who!

53:38.035 --> 53:40.838
Now, get your tail to wardrobe,
sweetheart.

53:43.874 --> 53:46.043

53:52.617 --> 53:54.286
Oh, my gosh.

53:54.319 --> 53:55.487
There he is.

53:55.520 --> 53:57.522
That's him.

53:57.555 --> 54:00.525
BUSTER:
Holy moly, it really is.

54:00.558 --> 54:03.194
He doesn't look so scary.

54:03.228 --> 54:05.096
Mr. Calloway!

54:05.929 --> 54:08.099
- Go away!
- BUSTER: No, please.

54:08.133 --> 54:10.402
We-we-we just want to talk
to you for one minute.

54:10.435 --> 54:12.237
That's all.

54:13.904 --> 54:17.342
We are not leaving
until you talk to us.

54:18.476 --> 54:20.844
Fine. If you're not
coming over here,

54:20.878 --> 54:22.980
we're coming over to you.

54:23.013 --> 54:24.848
No! Stay off the fence!

54:24.882 --> 54:26.284
Don't listen to him.

Porsha, you're still
messing it up.

55:03.588 --> 55:05.457
(groans) It's not my fault.

55:05.490 --> 55:07.392
He keeps missing the catch.

55:07.425 --> 55:09.893
I think she's trying to kill me.

55:09.927 --> 55:11.429
Reset. Let's go again.

55:11.463 --> 55:13.164
Meena! Darius!

55:13.198 --> 55:15.400
We're coming to you next,
and I better see

55:15.433 --> 55:17.669
some chemistry between you two.

55:17.702 --> 55:20.105
Okay, let's run these steps
one more time.

55:20.138 --> 55:23.675
- (snapping finger rhythmically)
- So, music starts, I step out,

55:23.708 --> 55:25.976
do my moves, fancy moves.

55:26.009 --> 55:27.412
BOTH:
Step together, drop.

55:27.445 --> 55:32.083
Gazing at each other like
we're burning up with love...

55:32.117 --> 55:32.916

55:32.950 --> 55:35.018
What are you doing
with your face?

55:36.521 --> 55:38.289
Your face looks broken.

55:38.323 --> 55:39.657
What is that?

55:39.691 --> 55:41.126
Uh...

55:41.159 --> 55:43.628
I was falling in love?

55:43.661 --> 55:45.563
Yeah, Gina, listen.

55:45.597 --> 55:47.699
I'm sorry, that-that's not what

55:47.732 --> 55:49.501
falling in love with me
looks like.

55:49.534 --> 55:51.069
I... I should know.

55:51.102 --> 55:53.036
I see it day after day,
week after week.

55:53.071 --> 55:55.038
(chuckles) Let's run it again.

55:55.073 --> 55:57.609
From the top!
And five, six, seven, eight.

55:57.642 --> 55:59.411
And one...

56:00.712 --> 56:02.547

56:03.548 --> 56:06.418
ALFONSO: Would you like
some ice cream, ma'am?

56:06.451 --> 56:10.321
Or should I say, Your Majesty?

56:11.322 --> 56:12.290
Uh...

56:12.323 --> 56:14.359
I just...
You look like a goddess,

56:14.392 --> 56:17.195
and, uh...
and-and-and lucky for you,

56:17.228 --> 56:19.697
it's "free ice cream
