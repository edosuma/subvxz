00:39.613 --> 00:41.945
<i>A philosopher once asked,</i>

00:42.049 --> 00:46.543
<i>"Are we human
because we gaze at the stars,</i>

00:46.653 --> 00:50.384
<i>"or do we gaze at them
because we are human?"</i>

00:51.258 --> 00:52.885
<i>Pointless, really.</i>

00:53.727 --> 00:55.854
<i>Do the stars gaze back?</i>

00:56.897 --> 00:58.728
<i>Now, that's a question.</i>

01:00.100 --> 01:02.534
<i>But I'm getting ahead of myself.</i>

01:02.636 --> 01:05.799
<i>Our story really begins here,</i>

01:05.906 --> 01:09.535
<i>150 years ago
at the Royal Academy of Science</i>

01:09.643 --> 01:11.941
<i>in London, England,</i>

01:12.880 --> 01:17.783
<i>where a letter arrived,
containing a very strange inquiry.</i>

01:19.153 --> 01:21.883
<i>It had come from a country boy</i>

01:21.989 --> 01:27.154
<i>and the scientist who read it thought it
might be a practical joke of some kind.</i>

01:27.261 --> 01:29.889
<i>But he duly wrote a reply</i>

01:29.997 --> 01:33.160
<i>politely explaining
that the query was nonsense.</i>

01:34.034 --> 01:39.233
<i>And posted it to the boy
who lived in a village called Wall,</i>

01:39.339 --> 01:43.435
<i>so named, the boy had said,
for the wall that ran alongside it.</i>

01:43.544 --> 01:49.505
<i>A wall that, according to local folklore,
hid an extraordinary secret.</i>

01:49.616 --> 01:54.074
I'm charged with guarding the portal
to another world.

01:54.186 --> 01:58.623
And you're asking me
to just let you through?

01:58.723 --> 02:02.625
Yes.
Because, let's be honest, it's a field.

02:02.727 --> 02:06.094
Look, do you see
another world out there?

02:06.198 --> 02:10.794
No. You see a field.
Do you see anything nonhuman?

02:10.901 --> 02:14.394
No. And you know why?
Because it's a field!

02:14.506 --> 02:17.737
Hundreds of years,
this wall's been here.

02:17.843 --> 02:22.610
Hundreds of years,
this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

02:22.714 --> 02:25.547
- Well...
- One more word,

02:25.650 --> 02:29.609
and I'll have you up
in front of the village council!

02:31.156 --> 02:34.421
- Well, that sounds rather final.
- Yeah.

02:35.861 --> 02:40.855
- Better just go home, then, I suppose.
- Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.827
Give my best to your father.

02:46.004 --> 02:47.130
Stop!

02:49.574 --> 02:50.666
Stop!

03:35.220 --> 03:37.814
I don't deal with time-wasters.

03:37.923 --> 03:39.720
Get over here and tend this stall.

03:39.824 --> 03:42.759
I'm off to The Slaughtered Prince
for a pint.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.931
See anything you like?

03:53.538 --> 03:55.403
Definitely.

03:55.507 --> 04:00.171
I mean, what I meant was these ones,
the blue ones.

04:01.079 --> 04:02.740
How much are they?

04:02.847 --> 04:05.714
They might be the color of your hair.

04:05.817 --> 04:09.947
Or they might be all of your memories
before you were three.

04:10.055 --> 04:12.319
I can check if you like.

04:12.424 --> 04:16.858
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells.
Buy this one instead.

04:17.760 --> 04:19.125
Snowdrop.

04:21.130 --> 04:22.995
It'll bring you luck.

04:24.367 --> 04:26.301
But what does that cost?

04:27.070 --> 04:29.937
This one costs a kiss.

04:50.093 --> 04:51.560
Is she gone?

04:53.563 --> 04:54.860
Follow me.

05:08.311 --> 05:10.973
I'm a princess,
tricked into being a witch's slave.

05:11.414 --> 05:12.938
Will you liberate me?

05:22.158 --> 05:25.685
It's an enchanted chain.
I'll only be free when she dies.

05:28.097 --> 05:29.121
Sorry.

05:29.232 --> 05:32.929
Well, if I can't liberate you,
what do you want of me?

05:51.287 --> 05:53.278
<i>So, the scientist was wrong.</i>

05:54.691 --> 05:57.251
<i>The wall had successfully done its job</i>

05:57.360 --> 06:01.626
<i>of hiding
the magical kingdom of Stormhold.</i>

06:01.731 --> 06:05.599
<i>The young man returned that night
to his home in England,</i>

06:05.702 --> 06:08.933
<i>hoping that his adventure
would soon be forgotten.</i>

06:09.038 --> 06:13.998
<i>But nine months later,
he received an unexpected souvenir.</i>

06:22.585 --> 06:27.648
This was left at the wall for you.
It says here his name is Tristan.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.646
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

06:54.749 --> 06:57.343
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

06:58.753 --> 07:03.156
<i>Eighteen years passed,
and the baby Tristan grew up</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:06.590
<i>knowing nothing
of his unconventional heritage.</i>

07:08.095 --> 07:12.327
<i>But never mind
how the infant became a boy.</i>

07:12.433 --> 07:16.733
<i>This is the story of
how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,</i>

07:17.605 --> 07:20.096
<i>a much greater challenge altogether.</i>

07:21.108 --> 07:23.406
<i>For to achieve it,</i>

07:23.511 --> 07:27.572
<i>he must win the heart
of his one true love.</i>

07:30.284 --> 07:31.581
- It's him!
- It's him!

07:35.790 --> 07:36.757
Humphrey?

07:36.757 --> 07:37.018
Humphrey?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.616
No, it's Tristan.

07:42.096 --> 07:44.155
Did I leave something at the shop?

07:44.265 --> 07:46.699
No. I just thought I could bring...

07:48.035 --> 07:50.162
Tristan Thorn,

07:50.271 --> 07:53.172
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

07:53.274 --> 07:55.538
Is there no end to your charms?

07:56.544 --> 07:58.671
Humphrey,
there's no need to be like that.

07:58.779 --> 08:00.713
Be nice to the poor boy.

08:02.016 --> 08:03.950
Were those for Victoria?

08:18.199 --> 08:21.327
You were always useless at fencing
in school, Tristan.

08:21.435 --> 08:24.768
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering
if there was anything you were good at.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.272
Humphrey, that's enough.

08:31.946 --> 08:34.005
Are you all right?

08:34.114 --> 08:35.342
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.337
- Want some breakfast?
- No, I'm really late for work.

09:00.441 --> 09:04.170
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Fine. Why?

09:04.276 --> 09:08.770
Oh, I don't know.
Last night, how'd it go?

09:08.881 --> 09:12.282
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

09:27.533 --> 09:28.830
Hello, Tristan.

09:28.934 --> 09:31.425
- Victoria.
- Pound of sugar, please.

09:33.539 --> 09:37.566
- Yes.
- Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

09:37.676 --> 09:40.736
Oh, look, I'm sorry about last night.
Humphrey was really rude.

09:40.846 --> 09:44.441
I also need a sack of potatoes
and some chocolate, please.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.688
May I perhaps see you tonight?

09:52.157 --> 09:54.216
No, but you may walk me home.

09:55.527 --> 09:56.619
Now?

09:57.663 --> 09:59.290
Yes. Yes, I can.

10:06.638 --> 10:08.469
Father, I lost my job.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.840
Father, I don't... I lost my job. I'm sorry.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.140
- Father...
- You lost your job.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.506
Yes, so I heard.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.650
Father, I'm sorry. I...

10:21.687 --> 10:24.588
Maybe Mr. Monday was right.
Maybe I am deluding myself.

10:24.690 --> 10:28.922
- I'm not good enough for Victoria.
- He said that? That's poppycock.

10:29.027 --> 10:30.790
You really want to know
how it went last night?

10:30.896 --> 10:31.988
Yeah.

10:32.898 --> 10:34.160
Not good.

10:35.133 --> 10:37.658
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

10:38.370 --> 10:40.201
I'm not like Humphrey.

10:40.739 --> 10:45.676
Tristan, I can tell you that every man
I ever envied when I was a boy

10:46.411 --> 10:48.572
has led an unremarkable life.

10:49.715 --> 10:54.311
So you don't fit with the popular crowd.
Now, I take that as a very good omen.

11:07.366 --> 11:10.096
- Tristan, I clearly said...
- I know. You told me not to come.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.796
I have something for you. A surprise.

11:13.905 --> 11:14.997
No...

11:29.285 --> 11:32.379
It's not my birthday for another week,
you know.

11:35.959 --> 11:39.292
- I've never had champagne before.
- Yeah, me, neither.

11:40.697 --> 11:43.063
My God! This is delicious!

11:44.834 --> 11:47.735
How did... Well,
how does a shop boy afford all of this?

11:47.837 --> 11:49.532
I'm not a shop boy.

11:50.473 --> 11:52.668
God! I heard. I'm sorry.
What are you going to do now?

11:52.776 --> 11:56.542
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy.
I was just working in a shop.

11:56.646 --> 11:59.877
And now I'm not.
Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

11:59.983 --> 12:02.451
This must have been all your savings.

12:02.552 --> 12:05.578
So? I can make more.
That's the beauty of it.

12:05.689 --> 12:07.281
I never intended to stay in Wall,
Victoria.

12:07.390 --> 12:10.723
There's a big world out there,
I'm gonna make my fortune.

12:10.827 --> 12:13.455
Now you sound just like Humphrey.
He's quite a traveler.

12:13.563 --> 12:17.795
Do you know he's going all the way
to lpswich just to buy me a ring?

12:17.901 --> 12:19.334
Lpswich?

12:19.436 --> 12:23.395
Victoria, I'm talking about London
or Paris or...

12:23.506 --> 12:27.306
A ring? Why is he...
What kind of a ring?

12:27.410 --> 12:30.277
The word is he's planning to propose
to me on my birthday.

12:30.413 --> 12:31.971
He's going to...

12:33.316 --> 12:34.715
And you're gonna say yes.

12:34.818 --> 12:38.345
I can't exactly say no
after he's gone all the way to lpswich.

12:38.455 --> 12:40.548
"All the way to lpswich"?

12:40.657 --> 12:45.560
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,
I'd cross oceans or continents.

12:46.396 --> 12:47.886
- Really?
- Yes.

12:47.997 --> 12:49.396
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

12:49.499 --> 12:52.866
I would go to
the gold fields of San Francisco

12:52.969 --> 12:55.437
and bring you back your weight in gold.

12:56.339 --> 12:57.567
I would.

12:58.508 --> 13:02.535
I'd go to Africa and bring you back
a diamond as big as your fist.

13:03.279 --> 13:06.146
Or I'd go to the Arctic
and I'd slaughter a polar bear

13:06.249 --> 13:08.376
and bring you back its head.

13:09.719 --> 13:11.448
A polar bear's head?

13:16.159 --> 13:17.990
You're funny, Tristan.

13:19.129 --> 13:23.031
People like you and people like me,
we're just not...

13:26.903 --> 13:28.370
I should be going. It's really late.

13:28.471 --> 13:31.998
Well, hold on, then.
Let's at least finish the champagne.

13:33.209 --> 13:34.301
Okay.

13:38.748 --> 13:42.741
<i>Had Tristan known then
how the stars watched Earth,</i>

13:42.852 --> 13:44.649
<i>he'd have shuddered at the very thought</i>

13:44.754 --> 13:47.154
<i>of an audience to his humiliation.</i>

13:49.626 --> 13:51.319
<i>But, fortunately for him,</i>

13:51.425 --> 13:54.394
<i>nearly every star in the sky
was at that moment</i>

13:54.495 --> 13:58.625
<i>looking in earnest at the land
on the other side of the wall,</i>

13:58.733 --> 14:02.294
<i>where the King of all Stormhold
lay on his deathbed,</i>

14:02.403 --> 14:06.305
<i>which was a coincidence
because it was the King's final act</i>

14:06.407 --> 14:11.777
<i>that would change the course
of Tristan's destiny forever.</i>

14:14.048 --> 14:15.948
Where is Secundus?

14:16.884 --> 14:18.943
He's on his way, Father.

14:19.053 --> 14:20.748
Then we shall wait.

14:30.231 --> 14:34.395
Sorry I'm late, Father.
I came as swiftly as I was able.

14:39.307 --> 14:40.535
Septimus.

14:40.975 --> 14:42.169
Primus.

14:43.311 --> 14:44.505
Tertius.

14:45.279 --> 14:49.648
So, to the matter of succession.

14:51.652 --> 14:56.555
Of my seven sons,
there are four of you today still standing.

14:56.657 --> 15:00.957
This is quite a break with tradition.
I had 12 brothers.

15:01.062 --> 15:02.859
And you killed them all for your throne

15:02.964 --> 15:05.990
before your father, the King,
even felt poorly.

15:06.734 --> 15:09.567
We know, Father.
You're strong and courageous.

15:09.670 --> 15:13.538
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

15:14.842 --> 15:18.005
- Secundus.
- Yes, Father?

15:18.112 --> 15:22.412
Look through the window.
Tell me what you see.

15:29.257 --> 15:31.282
I see the kingdom, Father.

15:33.027 --> 15:34.722
The whole of Stormhold.

15:34.829 --> 15:38.526
- And?
- My kingdom?

15:38.633 --> 15:41.033
Maybe. Look up.

16:07.061 --> 16:12.658
- Secundus.
- Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

16:13.868 --> 16:17.962
You're alive. You're...

16:18.070 --> 16:20.971
Stuck like this
till the new king is crowned.

16:21.740 --> 16:23.935
I was that close.

16:24.043 --> 16:26.307
Well, at least
you haven't lost your looks.

16:26.412 --> 16:29.313
Oh, please. You're not annoyed
about that whole murder thing, are you?

16:29.415 --> 16:32.407
- I mean, that was 10 years ago.
- Yeah.

16:32.518 --> 16:34.418
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it,
killing me, Secundus?

16:34.520 --> 16:37.785
Because now, of course,
now you are King of all Stormhold.

16:37.890 --> 16:40.757
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not.
You're dead.

16:40.859 --> 16:44.022
Una? Una?

16:44.129 --> 16:48.190
No, Father, it's me, your son.

16:49.101 --> 16:50.329
Tertius.

16:52.738 --> 16:55.468
Where is your sister, Una?

16:55.574 --> 16:58.873
Sorry, Father.
Nobody has seen Una for years now.

16:58.978 --> 17:01.173
- Septimus?
- What?

17:01.280 --> 17:06.775
Tradition dictates the throne must pass
to a male heir.

17:06.885 --> 17:09.012
Exactly, Father.

17:09.121 --> 17:11.851
So why would I kill my sister
when these cretins are still alive?

17:11.957 --> 17:13.117
Indeed.

17:14.593 --> 17:20.463
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation
in a non-traditional manner.

17:44.156 --> 17:49.526
Only he of royal blood
can restore the ruby.

17:49.628 --> 17:56.261
And the one of you that does so
shall be the new King of Stormhold.

18:46.883 --> 18:49.545
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

18:50.854 --> 18:52.151
Beautiful.

18:55.358 --> 18:58.327
More beautiful than a fancy ring
from lpswich?

19:01.131 --> 19:05.932
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

19:06.036 --> 19:09.699
I'd cross the wall
and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

19:09.973 --> 19:11.964
You can't cross the wall.

19:12.342 --> 19:14.936
Nobody crosses the wall.
Now you're just being silly.

19:15.045 --> 19:17.878
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

19:19.649 --> 19:21.640
For you, I'd do anything.

19:22.586 --> 19:24.520
My very own star.

19:28.225 --> 19:30.887
It seems we have ourselves
an agreement.

19:31.862 --> 19:35.229
You have exactly one week
or I'm marrying Humphrey.

20:47.404 --> 20:51.397
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

20:52.442 --> 20:55.900
- What is it?
- A star has fallen.

21:03.785 --> 21:05.548
Where are the Babylon candles?

21:05.653 --> 21:10.352
You used the last one, Lamia,
200 years ago. Do you not recall?

21:10.458 --> 21:12.093
Perhaps we can obtain another.

21:12.093 --> 21:12.718
Perhaps we can obtain another.

21:12.827 --> 21:16.263
Has your mind become
as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

21:16.364 --> 21:19.128
You speak as if such things
are freely available.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.599
I know, sister, I merely thought...

21:20.702 --> 21:22.226
You'd have us hunting
for a Babylon candle

21:22.337 --> 21:25.101
while some other witch finds our star.

21:25.206 --> 21:27.800
Fool. There's no time to waste.

21:28.543 --> 21:31.341
If we must retrieve it on foot,
then we shall.

21:31.446 --> 21:33.539
Mormo, we need information.

21:42.790 --> 21:47.659
If these divinations are correct,
the fallen star lies 100 miles away.

21:50.798 --> 21:56.168
Four centuries we've waited for this.
What hardship a few more days?

21:56.271 --> 21:59.707
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it
and bring it back?

22:07.849 --> 22:09.680
- I've his kidney.
- I've his liver.

22:09.784 --> 22:11.479
And I've his heart.

22:14.088 --> 22:17.114
You'll be needing
what's left of the last star.

22:24.098 --> 22:27.932
- There's not much left.
- Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

23:24.325 --> 23:28.953
- Dunstan Thorn. Not again.
- It's Tristan, actually.

23:29.829 --> 23:33.788
Oh. You do look a bit like your father.

23:33.899 --> 23:37.357
And I suppose you intend
to cross the wall as well, do you?

23:37.470 --> 23:39.301
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

23:39.405 --> 23:41.566
Cross the wall as well as who?

23:42.408 --> 23:44.706
No one. Nobody.

23:44.810 --> 23:47.278
Nobody crosses the wall.
You know that!

23:47.380 --> 23:49.644
Everybody knows that!

23:49.749 --> 23:53.276
Yeah... No, no, I know.
I understand. Nobody.

23:55.087 --> 23:57.487
Well, I better just head
for the old homestead, then.

23:57.590 --> 23:58.716
Yeah.

23:58.824 --> 24:02.988
- Right, then. Night, Tristan.
- Good night.

24:03.095 --> 24:05.188
Give my best to your father.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.685
Off you go.

24:35.694 --> 24:39.027
I thought I heard you come in.
Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

24:39.131 --> 24:40.359
No, I'm fine.

24:40.466 --> 24:41.956
- That Humphrey again?
- No.

24:42.067 --> 24:45.400
Actually, it was the guard.
The guard at the wall.

24:46.305 --> 24:47.704
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

24:47.807 --> 24:51.937
Well, that's given him plenty of time
to practice, then, hasn't it?

24:52.445 --> 24:55.608
Why, may I ask,
were you trying to cross the wall?

24:57.883 --> 25:00.181
I might ask you the same thing.

25:49.935 --> 25:51.525
I have a mother.

25:53.003 --> 25:55.938
I mean, I have a mother.
She could still be alive.

25:56.039 --> 25:58.974
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

26:02.913 --> 26:04.540
The chain you cut.

26:05.716 --> 26:07.047
Just like you said.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.276
And...

26:11.421 --> 26:13.889
And the glass flower.
The flower she sold to you.

26:13.991 --> 26:15.982
She told me it would bring me luck.

26:16.093 --> 26:17.390
Thank you.

26:19.196 --> 26:22.359
This was also in the basket.
I've never opened it.

26:23.100 --> 26:24.931
It's addressed to you.

26:41.251 --> 26:42.377
Yep.

26:42.486 --> 26:46.980
"My dearest Tristan, please know that
I only ever wanted the best for you."

26:48.425 --> 26:52.452
<i>Had my mistress allowed it,
I would have kept you in a heartbeat.</i>

26:53.797 --> 26:56.664
<i>My dearest wish is that
we will meet someday.</i>

26:58.335 --> 27:01.202
<i>The fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.</i>

27:02.606 --> 27:05.507
<i>To use it, think of me and only me.</i>

27:06.543 --> 27:10.377
<i>I will think of you every day, for always.</i>

27:13.016 --> 27:14.483
"Your mother."

27:21.658 --> 27:23.285
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

28:08.271 --> 28:09.636
Mother?

28:09.740 --> 28:12.971
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry.
Are you all right?

28:13.076 --> 28:16.339
No, I'm not.
And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

28:16.945 --> 28:19.539
You're... You're not my mother?

28:19.648 --> 28:21.946
Do I look like I'm your mother?

28:23.318 --> 28:24.342
No.

28:24.653 --> 28:25.813
Sorry.

28:28.089 --> 28:29.818
Well, are you all right?
Do you want some help?

28:29.924 --> 28:32.290
You can help by leaving me alone!

28:33.561 --> 28:34.892
All right.

28:42.137 --> 28:45.538
Oh, my God.
"Light the candle and think of me."

28:45.640 --> 28:47.665
I was. I was thinking of my...

28:47.776 --> 28:50.506
But then Victoria and the star
just popped into...

28:54.449 --> 28:56.474
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

28:56.584 --> 29:00.486
This may seem strange, but
have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

29:01.222 --> 29:03.087
- You're funny.
- No, really, we're in a crater.

29:03.191 --> 29:05.284
This must be where it fell.

29:05.727 --> 29:07.354
Yeah, this is where it fell.

29:07.462 --> 29:10.431
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

29:10.532 --> 29:12.864
up there is where
this weird, bloody necklace

29:12.967 --> 29:15.094
came out of nowhere
and knocked it out of the heavens

29:15.203 --> 29:17.034
when it was minding its own business.

29:17.138 --> 29:19.038
And over there is where it landed.

29:19.140 --> 29:24.908
And right here, this is where it got hit
by a magical flying moron!

29:28.083 --> 29:31.314
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

29:31.986 --> 29:36.582
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.
I had no idea you'd be a...

29:38.660 --> 29:41.424
May I just say in advance
that I am sorry?

29:41.763 --> 29:43.856
- Sorry for what?
- For this.

29:43.965 --> 29:46.866
Now, if I am not mistaken,
this means you have to come with me.

29:46.968 --> 29:50.631
See, you're going to be a birthday gift
for Victoria, my true love.

29:50.739 --> 29:52.104
But of course!

29:52.207 --> 29:56.200
Nothing says romance like the gift
of a kidnapped, injured woman!

29:56.544 --> 29:58.842
I'm not going anywhere with you.

30:04.085 --> 30:06.986
Hurry. You should be
on your way now, Primus.

30:08.757 --> 30:12.249
You must find the royal necklace
with the ruby before your brothers.

30:12.360 --> 30:16.763
I should like to see you take the throne.
The first benevolent king.

30:17.432 --> 30:21.459
I don't doubt Stormhold would be
a better place under your rule.

30:21.569 --> 30:22.797
Really?

30:22.904 --> 30:25.395
Well, that is fascinating.

30:25.507 --> 30:27.634
- Don't you think, Tertius?
- Yes, indeed.

30:27.742 --> 30:32.543
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well.
Well, well, I...

30:32.981 --> 30:37.145
Since you're all here,
won't you join me in a toast?

30:38.885 --> 30:40.512
What a very good idea.

30:40.620 --> 30:43.020
To the new King of Stormhold,

30:43.122 --> 30:46.353
whichever of you fine fellows
it might be.

30:47.093 --> 30:49.288
To the new King of Stormhold.

31:30.636 --> 31:31.728
You!

31:56.195 --> 31:58.823
You really thought that you were king?

31:59.131 --> 32:01.531
- You killed the Bishop?
- No, Primus.

32:01.634 --> 32:06.469
I think you'll find that you killed the
Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

32:07.540 --> 32:09.474
Oh, look, when you finish wrestling
with your conscience,

32:09.575 --> 32:12.305
may I suggest you return
to your chamber?

32:12.411 --> 32:14.811
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

32:22.088 --> 32:24.886
How have we lived this way
all these years?

32:37.870 --> 32:41.829
In my absence, I expect you to make it
fit for the queens we are.

32:42.508 --> 32:47.810
When I return with our prize,
all of us shall be young again.

32:49.548 --> 32:51.641
Never fear, my sisters.

32:53.152 --> 32:54.744
I will not fail.

33:05.195 --> 33:06.628
Don't you ever sleep?

33:06.730 --> 33:07.697
Not at night.

33:08.165 --> 33:09.530
May have escaped your notice, genius,

33:09.633 --> 33:11.658
but that's when stars
have rather better things to do.

33:11.769 --> 33:14.067
They're coming out, shining,
that sort of thing.

33:14.171 --> 33:17.402
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours,
but you're not in the sky anymore.

33:17.508 --> 33:19.476
Coming out is off the agenda.

33:19.576 --> 33:23.273
Shining has been suspended
until further notice.

33:23.380 --> 33:26.816
Oh, and sleeping during the day
is O-U-T.

33:27.551 --> 33:31.009
Unless you have some magical ability
to sleep while you're walking.

33:31.121 --> 33:33.487
Have you not got it
into your thick head yet?

33:33.590 --> 33:35.581
I'm not walking anywhere!

33:36.360 --> 33:37.486
Fine.

33:38.062 --> 33:41.088
Sit in a crater.
I've had enough of you anyway.

33:41.465 --> 33:44.059
I was gonna put you back in the sky
once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

33:44.168 --> 33:47.365
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own
in the middle of nowhere forever.

33:47.471 --> 33:50.838
And just how were you planning
to get me back to the sky?

33:50.941 --> 33:54.206
I find the fastest way to travel
is by candlelight.

33:54.645 --> 33:58.513
- You've got a Babylon candle.
- Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

33:58.615 --> 34:00.173
- A Babylon candle.
- That's what I said.

34:00.284 --> 34:01.273
You said "Bubbling."

34:01.385 --> 34:03.785
Anyway, I was going to give
what's left of it to you.

34:03.887 --> 34:06.219
Well, that barely has one use left.

34:06.323 --> 34:10.817
So be grateful I'm not using it right now
to get us both back to the wall.

34:10.928 --> 34:14.295
Unless you have a better way of
getting yourself home.

34:16.934 --> 34:18.060
Fine!

34:18.502 --> 34:20.163
Help me up.

34:20.838 --> 34:23.237
All right. All right. I'm helping.

34:24.608 --> 34:26.199
And you are gonna have to walk
quicker than that.

34:26.310 --> 34:29.074
Otherwise, I'll never get you back
to Victoria in a week.

34:29.179 --> 34:30.646
Don't push your luck.

34:32.516 --> 34:36.384
Don't take less than a florin for him,
Bernard! You understand?

34:36.487 --> 34:38.614
- Yes, Mother.
- No dilly-dallying!

34:38.722 --> 34:42.623
And don't even think of stopping at the
tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

34:42.726 --> 34:44.853
A florin for your goat, boy.

34:50.234 --> 34:52.702
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

34:54.571 --> 34:56.266
You're quite right.

35:06.583 --> 35:08.312
That's much better.

35:12.990 --> 35:14.218
Bernard!

35:16.060 --> 35:17.288
Bernard!

35:39.514 --> 35:40.708
Get on!

36:16.918 --> 36:18.215
Who goes there?

36:18.320 --> 36:20.311
What do you want with me,
a poor old flower...

36:20.422 --> 36:23.357
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

36:23.458 --> 36:28.088
and I swear by the ordinances of the
sisterhood to which we both belong

36:28.196 --> 36:30.664
that I mean you no harm this day.

36:30.765 --> 36:32.756
I wish to share your meal.

36:33.201 --> 36:39.071
Well, one can never be too careful.
Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

36:48.016 --> 36:49.813
- Anything else?
- Nope.

36:53.421 --> 36:54.979
What's it to be?

36:55.624 --> 36:57.148
Heads or tails?

36:57.826 --> 36:58.986
Heads.

37:00.795 --> 37:02.524
So, stranger,

37:02.998 --> 37:05.990
where are you headed off to
on this fine day?

37:06.101 --> 37:08.035
I seek a fallen star.

37:09.104 --> 37:10.901
She fell not far from here.

37:11.006 --> 37:13.236
And when I find her,
I shall take my great knife

37:13.341 --> 37:15.809
and cut out her heart
while she still lives.

37:15.911 --> 37:20.371
And the glory of our youth
shall be restored.

37:20.949 --> 37:22.348
Fallen star?

37:23.518 --> 37:26.043
That's the best news I've had in ages.

37:26.154 --> 37:28.918
I could do with losing
a few years meself.

37:29.024 --> 37:31.083
So whereabouts did you...

37:31.193 --> 37:32.717
Limbus grass!

37:32.827 --> 37:38.163
You dare to steal truth from my lips
by feeding me limbus grass?

37:38.266 --> 37:42.532
Do you have any idea what a big
mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

37:43.638 --> 37:45.731
How do you know my...

37:45.840 --> 37:47.831
- Who are you?
- Look again.

37:50.378 --> 37:54.278
I shall not seek the star,
Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

37:54.380 --> 37:56.041
Seek all you wish.

37:58.218 --> 38:01.676
You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.

38:02.722 --> 38:06.249
You will not perceive her
even if she stands before you.

38:13.233 --> 38:16.202
Pray you never meet me again,
Ditchwater Sal.

38:16.836 --> 38:18.895
Oh, right. So let me get this straight.

38:19.005 --> 38:21.565
You think you know
we're going the right way because...

38:21.674 --> 38:24.438
And I quote, "I just do."

38:24.544 --> 38:26.239
I do, though. I don't know why.

38:26.346 --> 38:29.008
Maybe it's my love for Victoria
guiding me home.

38:29.115 --> 38:30.673
- Please.
- Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

38:30.783 --> 38:33.411
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

38:33.519 --> 38:35.817
How many times do I have to...

38:35.922 --> 38:38.686
Would you...
Would you please slow down?

38:38.791 --> 38:40.053
Yes, yes.

38:41.995 --> 38:43.155
Look, we're...
We're going north, all right?

38:43.263 --> 38:44.525
The wall's north.

38:44.631 --> 38:47.794
And if you look up in the sky,
even during the day, you can see the...

38:47.900 --> 38:49.595
The evening star. That's so weird.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.567
That's funny. Hilarious.
My sides are splitting.

38:51.671 --> 38:53.263
No, I'm being...

38:54.440 --> 38:57.637
Wait that... That was you! Really?

38:58.911 --> 39:00.674
What... What are...

39:00.780 --> 39:03.112
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

39:03.216 --> 39:05.377
- Sitting down. I'm tired.
- Please don't do this again.

39:05.485 --> 39:07.953
We agreed we'd stop off
at the next village to eat and rest.

39:08.054 --> 39:11.023
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

39:11.624 --> 39:15.958
I never stay up this late!
Just, please, let me sleep!

39:16.796 --> 39:21.290
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep.
I'll go and get something to eat.

39:28.074 --> 39:29.268
What are you doing?

39:29.375 --> 39:33.607
What does it look like I'm doing?
I'm making sure you don't run away.

39:49.729 --> 39:54.132
Your Highness, the soothsayer,
as you requested.

39:55.568 --> 39:57.160
South, you said.

39:58.137 --> 39:59.627
South we went.

40:01.074 --> 40:02.598
Still no stone.

40:04.510 --> 40:06.637
Do you now propose
we start swimming?

40:06.746 --> 40:11.809
Sire, I've merely relayed to you
what the runes have told me.

40:11.918 --> 40:13.510
I can do no more.

40:14.785 --> 40:16.753
Well, consult them again.

40:17.188 --> 40:18.280
Wait.

40:21.292 --> 40:25.285
Before we seek the stone,
I have another question.

40:27.231 --> 40:29.028
Am I the seventh son?

40:33.571 --> 40:34.663
Yes.

40:34.772 --> 40:36.399
Another question.

40:37.141 --> 40:39.769
Is my favorite color blue?

40:43.481 --> 40:44.470
Yes.

40:44.582 --> 40:48.313
Has excessive begging or pleading
ever persuaded me

40:48.419 --> 40:50.683
to spare the life of a traitor?

40:53.991 --> 40:55.515
What does that mean?

40:55.626 --> 40:58.186
- That means no.
- Good.

40:59.163 --> 41:02.098
Throw them again.
This time, throw them high.

41:06.170 --> 41:08.229
Do you work for my brother?

41:24.655 --> 41:27.681
So, do we continue west?

41:58.155 --> 41:59.349
Tristan?

42:08.365 --> 42:09.764
Who's there?

42:17.241 --> 42:19.004
Tristan, is that you?

42:20.110 --> 42:21.600
It's not funny.

42:25.950 --> 42:27.178
Tristan?

42:37.361 --> 42:38.587
Come on.

43:21.970 --> 43:24.564
Be careful how much magic
you use, sister.

43:24.673 --> 43:26.470
It's beginning to show.

43:26.575 --> 43:29.908
One goat and a small enchantment.
Hardly extravagant.

43:30.012 --> 43:32.947
Well, even using the ring
will take its toll.

43:33.048 --> 43:35.380
Better you call on us only in dire need.

43:35.484 --> 43:38.783
And use your runes
to locate the star yourself.

43:38.887 --> 43:40.878
I used them and she should be here.

43:40.989 --> 43:43.787
But now
they're just telling me gibberish.

44:01.243 --> 44:04.041
It is because you must stay
where you are, my sister.

44:04.146 --> 44:05.374
She is coming to you.

44:05.480 --> 44:08.108
Oh, be warned, Lamia.
Delicacy is needed.

44:08.216 --> 44:12.243
Misery has drained her.
She's barely shining.

44:12.354 --> 44:17.087
Set a trap that ensures her heart
is glowing before you cut it out.

44:17.926 --> 44:21.089
Yvaine! Yvaine!

44:21.964 --> 44:23.454
Oh, you idiot.

44:45.220 --> 44:47.848
You shall become human.

46:04.898 --> 46:09.096
You are Billy, the innkeeper.
I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

46:09.202 --> 46:13.662
Now, make everything ready.
Our special guest will be here soon.

46:24.584 --> 46:28.680
I mean, who's to say he'd have even
kept his promise about the candle?

46:28.788 --> 46:32.451
I just refuse to believe
he's the only person in Stormhold

46:32.559 --> 46:34.254
who could've helped me.

46:34.360 --> 46:38.626
Going on and on and on.
Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

46:41.034 --> 46:42.262
<i>Tristan?</i>

46:43.703 --> 46:46.297
<i>Please protect our sister, Tristan.</i>

46:47.340 --> 46:50.173
<i>Yvaine is in grave danger.</i>

46:51.010 --> 46:53.308
<i>The unicorn came to help her.</i>

46:54.047 --> 46:56.538
<i>But now they're heading into a trap.</i>

47:00.553 --> 47:03.351
<i>No star is safe in Stormhold.</i>

47:04.290 --> 47:08.590
<i>The last to fall, 400 years ago,</i>

47:08.695 --> 47:14.031
<i>was captured by the same witches
who seek Yvaine now.</i>

47:15.235 --> 47:16.862
<i>They tricked her,</i>

47:18.404 --> 47:19.894
<i>cared for her,</i>

47:21.207 --> 47:24.836
<i>and when her heart
was once more aglow,</i>

47:25.445 --> 47:28.810
<i>they cut it from her chest</i>

47:29.881 --> 47:31.508
<i>and ate it.</i>

47:34.085 --> 47:36.053
<i>There's no time to waste.</i>

47:36.154 --> 47:37.883
<i>A coach is coming.</i>

47:37.989 --> 47:41.618
<i>By any means possible,
you must get on it.</i>

47:42.260 --> 47:43.318
<i>Run.</i>

48:23.835 --> 48:26.827
If Septimus insists on sending a boy
to do a man's job...

48:26.938 --> 48:27.927
No, no, no, wait, please!

48:28.039 --> 48:29.904
I don't know a Septimus.
I just need a lift.

48:30.007 --> 48:32.805
Look at me, look at me.
I'm unarmed. Please.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.303
Please, let me ride with you.

48:35.413 --> 48:38.780
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

48:38.883 --> 48:40.783
Well, then all the more reason
to take me with you.

48:40.885 --> 48:44.377
There may come a time when you need
a second pair of hands. Sir?

48:44.488 --> 48:48.117
Please. Maybe providence sent me
to you just as it sent you to me.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.256
- Get on.
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

49:17.355 --> 49:20.882
Goodness me, my dear.
Come in out of this wretched rain!

49:21.325 --> 49:25.557
We have food and drink, a warm bed
and plenty of hot water for a bath.

49:44.649 --> 49:48.813
How do you like your bath?
Warm, hot or boil-a-lobster?

49:49.754 --> 49:50.946
I honestly don't know.

49:51.053 --> 49:52.452
Then let me choose for you,

49:52.554 --> 49:55.751
and I'll have my husband
take your horse to the stable.

49:56.725 --> 49:57.851
Billy?

50:08.737 --> 50:12.002
Now, let's get you out
of your wet things, shall we?

50:23.319 --> 50:24.786
Feeling better?

50:24.887 --> 50:26.616
Much. Thank you.

50:27.022 --> 50:29.513
The warm water's actually done me
a world of good.

50:29.625 --> 50:32.594
You see?
The powers of a nice, hot bath.

50:32.695 --> 50:35.129
And your leg? Any improvement?

50:37.032 --> 50:38.863
That is extraordinary.

50:39.368 --> 50:43.099
It's the very least I could do.
I'm just glad you're feeling better.

50:43.205 --> 50:45.070
You seem happier in yourself, too.

50:45.174 --> 50:48.473
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

50:49.712 --> 50:50.872
Wonderful.

50:51.280 --> 50:54.875
Nothing like a nice soak
to warm the cockles of your heart.

51:02.858 --> 51:06.191
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

51:06.295 --> 51:09.787
but I've been told
I have a healer's hands.

51:10.933 --> 51:13.367
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

51:13.902 --> 51:15.392
What's a massage?

51:15.504 --> 51:18.735
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

51:19.475 --> 51:23.605
Nothing like a massage to send you off
for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

51:23.712 --> 51:25.179
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

51:25.280 --> 51:27.145
Lie on your back, dear.

51:30.185 --> 51:32.153
Why not close your eyes?

51:33.222 --> 51:35.588
You'll drift off better that way.

51:49.972 --> 51:50.996
Hello!

51:53.108 --> 51:54.097
Service!

51:54.209 --> 51:56.734
Maybe we should carry on
and try the next inn,

51:56.845 --> 51:59.575
especially if this stone is as close
as your runes say.

51:59.681 --> 52:01.410
I'll give it one more try.

52:05.954 --> 52:07.182
Relax here, my love.

52:07.289 --> 52:10.656
I'll be back just as soon as
I've taken care of this customer.

52:15.762 --> 52:18.196
At last. We require accommodation.

52:18.298 --> 52:21.631
Please help my friend
take the horses to the stables.

52:35.615 --> 52:36.741
Hello!

52:57.370 --> 52:58.860
I'm accustomed to better service,

52:58.972 --> 53:01.839
but you're awake now
and that's what counts.

53:02.709 --> 53:04.040
Prepare your best room.

53:04.144 --> 53:05.202
- She got the stone.
- Stone, stone.

53:05.312 --> 53:09.476
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir.
I am the lady of this inn.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.107
Glass of wine?

53:11.218 --> 53:12.412
No, no, no, no, no.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.309
No.

53:15.288 --> 53:19.315
Until my brother is dead,
I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

53:21.461 --> 53:24.953
Though my friend in the stables
might be glad of a drop.

53:27.267 --> 53:29.201
Your best room, perhaps?

53:30.804 --> 53:32.135
Of course.

53:39.346 --> 53:41.473
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

53:42.048 --> 53:44.016
Traveling alone, are you?

53:45.519 --> 53:48.886
I've just stabled my four black stallions
and my carriage.

53:48.989 --> 53:52.117
Well, I say mine.
It belonged to my late father.

54:06.106 --> 54:07.334
Thank you.

54:07.440 --> 54:11.740
That's so kind, thank you very much.
My name's Tristan. What's yours?

54:11.845 --> 54:13.073
Bernard.

54:20.887 --> 54:24.015
There was not a horse or beast
he could not master.

54:24.124 --> 54:26.854
So much so that in his youth,
he took to riding a camel,

54:26.960 --> 54:28.325
which was comical.

54:28.428 --> 54:30.521
When he passed,
the carriage came to me.

54:30.630 --> 54:31.654
She's got the stone!

54:31.765 --> 54:32.754
- She's got it!
- She's got it!

54:32.866 --> 54:36.131
And it's the largest in all of Stormhold,
so they say.

54:36.236 --> 54:38.998
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

54:39.103 --> 54:40.195
Wait.

54:40.905 --> 54:42.896
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

54:43.007 --> 54:44.599
- Oh, finally.
- Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

54:44.709 --> 54:45.676
- Well done.
- Sweet.

54:45.777 --> 54:46.766
Come here. Let me see it.

54:59.824 --> 55:01.815
You have no idea
what you're meddling with.

55:01.926 --> 55:07.728
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold
and I demand that you bring it to me!

55:07.832 --> 55:09.322
Bring me the stone! Now!

55:09.434 --> 55:12.562
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything
they give you! They tried to...

55:28.620 --> 55:30.850
- Are you all right?
- Billy!

55:33.024 --> 55:34.150
Get him!

56:12.764 --> 56:15.164
The burning golden heart
of a star at peace

56:15.266 --> 56:18.292
is so much better
than your frightened little heart.

56:18.403 --> 56:22.339
Even so, better than no heart at all.

56:24.342 --> 56:27.038
Yvaine?
Hold me tight and think of home.

56:35.219 --> 56:37.881
No!

56:56.341 --> 57:00.744
- What the hell did you do?
- What did I do? What did you do?

57:00.845 --> 57:03.744
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

57:03.846 --> 57:05.905
You thought of your home
and I thought of mine

57:06.015 --> 57:07.880
and now we're halfway between the two!

57:07.983 --> 57:11.043
Oh, you stupid cow!
What did you think of your home for?

57:11.153 --> 57:12.586
You just said "home"!

57:12.688 --> 57:16.021
If you wanted me to think of your home,
you should have said!

57:16.125 --> 57:18.559
Some crazy lady
was going to cut your heart out

57:18.661 --> 57:20.390
and you wanted
more specific instructions?

57:20.496 --> 57:23.897
Perhaps you'd like it in writing!
Or a diagram, maybe!

57:32.274 --> 57:36.074
Look, Captain Shakespeare!
Caught ourselves a little bonus!

57:36.679 --> 57:38.977
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

57:42.852 --> 57:45.912
They don't look
like Lightning Marshals to me.

57:46.021 --> 57:49.115
Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?

57:49.225 --> 57:52.422
"Why else would anyone be up here
in the middle of a storm?"

57:52.561 --> 57:54.290
Well, let's think.

57:54.397 --> 57:57.662
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason
we are!

57:58.401 --> 57:59.959
Now, who are you?

58:01.837 --> 58:05.068
Let's see if a night on our lovely brig
will loosen their lips!

58:05.174 --> 58:08.109
- Get them in the brig!
- You heard the man! Let's go!

58:08.210 --> 58:12.977
Get them into the brig and the rest of
you dirty dogs, back to work!

58:13.082 --> 58:15.676
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

58:39.675 --> 58:43.441
- They're going to kill us, aren't they?
- I don't know.

58:46.115 --> 58:48.982
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

58:50.386 --> 58:53.116
I used to watch people
having adventures.

58:55.224 --> 58:56.714
I envied them.

58:58.227 --> 59:01.196
You ever heard the expression,
"Be careful what you wish for"?

59:01.297 --> 59:03.993
What? So ending up with my heart
cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

59:04.099 --> 59:07.125
No. No, I didn't...
I didn't mean it like that.

59:09.138 --> 59:11.265
Look, I admire you dreaming.

59:12.675 --> 59:14.643
Shop boy like me,

59:14.743 --> 59:16.643
I could never have imagined
an adventure this big

59:16.745 --> 59:19.009
in order to have wished for it.

59:19.381 --> 59:22.316
I just thought
I'd find some lump of celestial rock

59:22.418 --> 59:25.012
and take it home, and that would be it.

59:25.120 --> 59:26.449
And you got me.

59:34.761 --> 59:38.788
If there's one thing I've learned
in all my years watching Earth,

59:38.899 --> 59:41.697
it's that people aren't
what they may seem.

59:42.436 --> 59:43.460
There are shop boys

59:43.570 --> 59:47.836
and there are boys who just happen
to work in shops for the time being.

59:47.941 --> 59:51.934
And trust me, Tristan,
you're no shop boy.

59:54.181 --> 59:56.843
You saved my life. Thank you.

01:00:01.822 --> 01:00:03.414
Well, well, well.

01:00:04.057 --> 01:00:05.888
The last brother dead.

01:00:07.628 --> 01:00:09.653
Which means that I'm king.

01:00:13.734 --> 01:00:14.962
I'm king!

01:00:17.938 --> 01:00:19.530
Not yet, brother.

01:00:20.807 --> 01:00:23.002
Damn. I still need the stone.

01:00:24.244 --> 01:00:28.010
- Your brother doesn't have it?
- Well, why don't you find out?

01:00:38.258 --> 01:00:39.885
Where is my stone?

01:00:39.993 --> 01:00:41.722
I don't...

01:00:41.828 --> 01:00:44.729
The man, see, your brother...
I heard him speak of a stone.

01:00:44.831 --> 01:00:47.732
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

01:00:47.834 --> 01:00:49.734
- What girl?
- I don't know.

01:00:49.836 --> 01:00:52.532
A girl. She got away.
Because this was a trap set up for her,

01:00:52.639 --> 01:00:55.699
but your brother,
he come just straight into it.

01:00:55.809 --> 01:00:58.073
A trap? Set by who?

01:00:58.378 --> 01:01:00.278
A woman you should pray
you'll never meet.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.574
She's...

01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:05.416
She's gone.
She took your brother's carriage.

01:01:05.519 --> 01:01:07.612
This woman wanted my stone?

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:10.121
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

01:01:10.223 --> 01:01:14.523
She said the girl was a star and
she wanted to cut out her heart and...

01:01:17.164 --> 01:01:18.358
Eat it?

01:01:20.133 --> 01:01:21.498
Oh, my God.

01:01:23.070 --> 01:01:25.630
Do you have any idea what this means?

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.567
Everlasting life.

01:01:29.943 --> 01:01:31.934
King forever.

01:01:36.083 --> 01:01:37.641
It's not here, sire.

01:01:37.751 --> 01:01:39.844
This idiot's coming with us.

01:02:04.275 --> 01:02:06.334
- Ask again.
- We have asked again

01:02:06.444 --> 01:02:08.742
and the answer is still the same.
She is airborne!

01:02:08.847 --> 01:02:10.144
Well, she can't remain so forever.

01:02:10.248 --> 01:02:12.216
Inform me
as soon as she touches ground!

01:02:12.317 --> 01:02:14.217
Lmmediately! Do you understand?

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:17.880
Watch your tongue, sister!
It is you and not we who've lost her.

01:02:17.989 --> 01:02:19.854
Lost her and broken the knife!

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:22.927
Even if you apprehend her,
how will you complete the deed?

01:02:23.028 --> 01:02:26.395
Perhaps you should return now
and one of us set out in your place.

01:02:26.498 --> 01:02:27.692
Don't be absurd.

01:02:27.799 --> 01:02:30.666
I'll bring her home
and deal with her there.

01:02:30.769 --> 01:02:33.636
Be sure everything is ready
for our arrival.

01:02:40.478 --> 01:02:42.605
Tell me about Victoria then.

01:02:46.251 --> 01:02:47.878
Well, she...

01:02:51.456 --> 01:02:54.050
There's nothing more to tell you.

01:02:54.159 --> 01:02:59.688
Because the little I know about love
is that it's unconditional.

01:03:00.432 --> 01:03:02.832
It's not something you can buy.

01:03:02.934 --> 01:03:05.801
Hang on.
This wasn't about me buying her love.

01:03:07.902 --> 01:03:10.666
This was a way for me
to prove how I felt.

01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:16.410
And what's she doing to prove
how she feels about you?

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:17.670
Well...

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:25.883
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand
when you meet her. All right?

01:03:26.387 --> 01:03:29.447
Provided we don't get murdered
by pirates first.

01:03:30.491 --> 01:03:35.588
Murdered by pirates.
Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

01:03:35.696 --> 01:03:38.494
I can't quite decide
which sounds more fun.

01:03:41.035 --> 01:03:43.265
We've located the sky vessel.

01:03:43.371 --> 01:03:45.965
It's headed north
for the port town on Mount Drummond

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:49.406
and you are no longer
the only one seeking the star.

01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:51.478
There's someone following your tracks!

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:53.672
A witch? A warlock?

01:03:53.781 --> 01:03:56.909
A prince and he's catching you up!
Get a move on!

01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:30.713
So, this is the part where you tell me
who you are and why you're up here.

01:04:31.517 --> 01:04:36.750
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers
one by one like dry twigs!

01:04:39.058 --> 01:04:41.083
My name is Tristan Thorn.

01:04:41.393 --> 01:04:43.918
- This is my wife, Yvaine.
- Your wife?

01:04:44.596 --> 01:04:48.293
Far too young and radiant
to belong to just one man!

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:52.535
It's share and share alike
aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

01:04:54.073 --> 01:04:55.062
If you dare even touch her...

01:04:55.174 --> 01:04:57.870
You may think you're showing
a little spirit in front of your lady friend,

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.810
but if you talk back to me again,
I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

01:05:00.913 --> 01:05:02.972
you impertinent little pup!

01:05:03.882 --> 01:05:06.749
- Sir?
- Better! But still interrupting.

01:05:06.852 --> 01:05:10.686
Let's see.
A hanging's always good for morale!

01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:13.280
Maybe we'll watch you dance
a gallows jig!

01:05:15.361 --> 01:05:19.320
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side
and have done with it!

01:05:20.065 --> 01:05:21.965
It's a very long way down.

01:05:22.067 --> 01:05:25.468
Plenty of time to reminisce
about your pitifully short lives.

01:05:25.571 --> 01:05:28.506
Please, look, we're just trying
to make our way home,

01:05:28.607 --> 01:05:29.938
back to a place called Wall,
where I come from.

01:05:30.042 --> 01:05:31.566
What did you say?

01:05:31.677 --> 01:05:33.770
I said we were trying to get home
to Wall.

01:05:33.879 --> 01:05:35.779
That's one lie too many, my son.

01:05:35.881 --> 01:05:36.848
- Wall?
- Shut up.

01:05:36.949 --> 01:05:37.916
What's he saying?

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:40.918
Thought you could just wander
onto my patch, did you?

01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:42.453
- He is. Yeah, he's gonna...
- And live to tell the tale?

01:05:42.554 --> 01:05:45.045
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck,
on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

01:05:45.157 --> 01:05:49.594
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn!
And the last one you'll ever make!

01:05:56.869 --> 01:05:59.736
- No! No! You brute!
- Come... Come on!

01:05:59.838 --> 01:06:02.966
- You murderer! You pig!
- Come on! Get up! Get up!

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:06.674
I'm taking the girl to my cabin,
and mark my words,

01:06:06.779 --> 01:06:08.508
anyone who disturbs me
for the next few hours

01:06:08.614 --> 01:06:10.479
- will get the same treatment!
- What? You'll...

01:06:10.582 --> 01:06:13.210
No, you idiot!
I'll sling you over the side as well!

01:06:13.318 --> 01:06:14.580
Oh, yeah.

01:06:18.924 --> 01:06:21.290
Captain's busy. So should you be.

01:06:22.928 --> 01:06:24.691
Get in there, wench!

01:06:30.769 --> 01:06:33.397
So, that went well, I thought.

01:06:34.239 --> 01:06:38.503
Now, tell me news
of my beloved England.

01:06:38.608 --> 01:06:41.202
I want to hear absolutely everything.

01:06:42.512 --> 01:06:45.504
Hang on.
I can't believe your crew fell for that.

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:48.049
And where in God's name
did you get that mannequin from?

01:06:48.151 --> 01:06:49.846
Oh, it works every time.

01:06:49.953 --> 01:06:52.183
An ounce of bargaining,
a pinch of trickery,

01:06:52.289 --> 01:06:54.814
<i>a soupçon of intimidation, et voilà!</i>

01:06:54.925 --> 01:06:57.018
The perfect recipe
for a towering reputation

01:06:57.127 --> 01:06:59.595
without ever having to spill
one drop of blood.

01:06:59.696 --> 01:07:03.097
Ever try to get blood stains out
of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.658
Right. I still don't understand
how they won't recognize me.

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:07.759
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

01:07:07.871 --> 01:07:08.838
your own mother won't recognize you.

01:07:08.939 --> 01:07:09.928
Now, we've no time to waste.

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.905
We have only two hours
before we make port.

01:07:12.008 --> 01:07:13.703
First and foremost...

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:20.975
It'll be so good to see you
out of those dreary clothes.

01:07:21.084 --> 01:07:24.349
So very small-town errand-boy.
Howlingly parochial.

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:28.284
<i>Here. Très you.</i>

01:07:28.925 --> 01:07:31.587
I wore it as a younger man.
I hate to throw anything away.

01:07:31.695 --> 01:07:33.287
You know the day you do,
it'll come back in fashion,

01:07:33.396 --> 01:07:35.296
<i>be oh, so de la mode.</i>

01:07:35.398 --> 01:07:36.797
Now, you, darling.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:38.595
I have some lovely dresses.
Take your pick.

01:07:38.702 --> 01:07:40.169
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

01:07:40.270 --> 01:07:42.636
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

01:07:44.608 --> 01:07:48.271
Now, England, England.
I want to hear everything.

01:07:49.012 --> 01:07:51.207
- You're not from England.
- Oh, no, sadly, no.

01:07:51.314 --> 01:07:53.612
But from my earliest youth,
I lapped up the stories.

01:07:53.717 --> 01:07:55.446
People always told me they were
nothing more than folklore,

01:07:55.552 --> 01:07:58.043
but my heart told me they were true.

01:07:58.155 --> 01:08:00.350
As a boy, I'd scurry away
from my father at the market

01:08:00.457 --> 01:08:03.324
while he did his deals
just to peek over the wall,

01:08:03.426 --> 01:08:06.418
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day,
seeing England for myself.

01:08:06.530 --> 01:08:08.930
Really? So you...
You were here looking over there.

01:08:09.032 --> 01:08:10.260
Oh, yes.

01:08:11.801 --> 01:08:14.167
- Hair.
- Hair?

01:08:15.372 --> 01:08:17.670
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

01:08:17.774 --> 01:08:20.037
Tried to make my father,
Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

01:08:20.143 --> 01:08:22.542
Forged a decent reputation
as a ruthless marauder

01:08:22.645 --> 01:08:24.613
and cold-blooded killer.

01:08:25.015 --> 01:08:26.743
But my father died.

01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.746
I always promised him
I'd take over the family business,

01:08:29.853 --> 01:08:31.821
keep the old girl flying.

01:08:32.856 --> 01:08:34.756
You have no idea the lightness
it brings to my heart

01:08:34.858 --> 01:08:37.884
being able to confide in you
charming young people.

01:08:37.993 --> 01:08:40.326
The pressure of maintaining the
whole Captain Shakespeare persona

01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:42.421
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

01:08:42.532 --> 01:08:44.055
Sometimes...

01:08:44.167 --> 01:08:47.136
You see, I'm very much
a man of my own creation.

01:08:47.237 --> 01:08:50.104
Even chose the name specially.
Took me ages.

01:08:50.207 --> 01:08:52.300
See, I'm thinking
legendary British wordsmith.

01:08:52.408 --> 01:08:55.435
My enemies and crew are thinking,
"Shake! Spear!"

01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:58.240
It's little things like that make me happy.

01:08:58.582 --> 01:09:00.640
I don't understand that.

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:03.546
Surely it would make you happier
just to be yourself.

01:09:03.651 --> 01:09:06.950
Why fight to be accepted by people
you don't actually want to be like?

01:09:07.055 --> 01:09:10.081
Yeah.
Why would anyone do that to himself?

01:09:11.392 --> 01:09:12.620
Exactly.

01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:19.564
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

01:09:33.348 --> 01:09:34.609
Hurry up.

01:09:43.658 --> 01:09:46.559
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh.
I'll be honest.

01:09:46.661 --> 01:09:48.685
Shall I give you a little taste,
young Ferdinand?

01:09:48.796 --> 01:09:50.559
No, no. Oh, there you go.

01:09:53.167 --> 01:09:54.896
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

01:09:55.003 --> 01:09:58.939
<i>I think it's still crackling,
very much alive, still très fresh.</i>

01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.834
- So, name your best price.
- For 10,000 bolts?

01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:04.377
Ten thousand bolts
of finest quality grade A.

01:10:04.479 --> 01:10:07.346
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift,
isn't it? Difficult to store.

01:10:07.448 --> 01:10:10.679
If I get the Revenue Men in here
sniffing round, what's the...

01:10:10.785 --> 01:10:12.548
Best price, 150 guineas.

01:10:12.654 --> 01:10:13.121
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

01:10:13.121 --> 01:10:14.986
Gentlemen, put the merchandise
back onboard and prepare to sail.

01:10:15.089 --> 01:10:16.386
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

01:10:16.524 --> 01:10:18.253
Hold on. Hold on. One minute.
Hold on, cuddles.

01:10:18.359 --> 01:10:20.224
- Oh, he's...
- One-sixty. One-sixty.

01:10:20.328 --> 01:10:22.262
Seeing as I'm feeling
particularly generous today,

01:10:22.363 --> 01:10:23.625
I'll settle for 200.

01:10:23.731 --> 01:10:26.757
Two hundred? Okay.
You're having a laugh.

01:10:26.868 --> 01:10:28.130
Have you had your head in that?

01:10:28.236 --> 01:10:31.296
Has he been sailing up
where the air's too thin?

01:10:32.807 --> 01:10:35.401
- You're being very rude.
- Not anymore.

01:10:36.577 --> 01:10:38.340
- Two hundred.
- One-eighty.

01:10:38.446 --> 01:10:39.879
- Two hundred.
- That's not negotiation.

01:10:39.981 --> 01:10:42.279
I'm changing my number.
One-eight-five.

01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:44.817
- Did I hear 200?
- From you, you did. Yeah.

01:10:44.919 --> 01:10:47.717
- You said 200.
- If I did, you're a ventriloquist.

01:10:47.822 --> 01:10:49.881
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

01:10:50.258 --> 01:10:54.319
One-nine-five it is.
So, with sales tax, that's, let's see, 200.

01:10:54.429 --> 01:10:56.624
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

01:10:57.031 --> 01:10:59.192
Unbelievable. Here.

01:11:04.672 --> 01:11:06.401
Yes? Can I help you?

01:11:08.443 --> 01:11:09.535
Nosy.

01:11:10.011 --> 01:11:13.242
Have you heard any of these rumors
going round about a fallen star?

01:11:13.348 --> 01:11:14.747
Everyone's talking about it.

01:11:14.849 --> 01:11:18.148
You get your hands on one of them,
we can shut up shop. Retire.

01:11:18.252 --> 01:11:19.947
- Fallen star?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.991 --> 01:11:27.686
- Nothing on your travels?
- No.

01:11:27.793 --> 01:11:29.021
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

01:11:29.128 --> 01:11:30.823
Everyone's going on about it
down at the market.

01:11:30.930 --> 01:11:32.192
Which market?
The market near the wall?

01:11:32.298 --> 01:11:33.265
Yeah.

01:11:33.366 --> 01:11:35.129
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time
listening to gossip

01:11:35.234 --> 01:11:37.168
from the kind of pond scum
trading down there.

01:11:37.269 --> 01:11:39.601
- Well, if it...
- Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

01:11:39.705 --> 01:11:41.434
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:43.838
Oh, what a wonderful woman
you are, Sal.

01:11:43.943 --> 01:11:45.638
How the world wouldn't be
the same place without you.

01:11:45.745 --> 01:11:47.406
You look great.
You've had your feet done, haven't you?

01:11:47.513 --> 01:11:51.609
But, you two, you have business
to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

01:11:51.717 --> 01:11:54.413
Come on.
I've got something new for you.

01:12:01.093 --> 01:12:02.822
Captain Shakespeare.

01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:04.526
Stand down!

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:06.325
Meet my nephew,
the fearsome buccaneer,

01:12:06.432 --> 01:12:07.922
Tristan Thorn.

01:12:08.267 --> 01:12:10.792
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

01:12:10.903 --> 01:12:14.304
I have the perfect gift
to keep you amused on the way.

01:12:28.521 --> 01:12:29.988
Right, you lazy dogs!

01:12:30.089 --> 01:12:32.751
Let's get young Tristan
on his way home!

01:14:24.968 --> 01:14:26.162
Touché.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:28.327
I'm impressed.

01:14:44.288 --> 01:14:46.381
Yvaine, I know what you are.

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:51.717
No, no. Have no fear.

01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:56.393
No one on this vessel will harm you,
but there are plenty who would.

01:14:59.803 --> 01:15:03.534
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine.
You must learn to control them.

01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.938
You've been glowing
more brightly every day,

01:15:06.043 --> 01:15:07.476
and I think you know why.

01:15:07.578 --> 01:15:10.342
Of course I know why I'm glowing.
I'm a star.

01:15:10.514 --> 01:15:14.473
- And what do stars do best?
- Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

01:15:25.662 --> 01:15:26.924
- Now try.
- Okay.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.129
- See?
- Very good.

01:15:47.417 --> 01:15:48.816
Due west, you say?

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.250
And you're certain
he had a girl with him?

01:15:50.354 --> 01:15:51.343
Yeah.

01:15:51.455 --> 01:15:54.754
You're sure? Absolutely sure?
Sure you're not lying?

01:15:55.258 --> 01:15:57.556
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

01:15:58.895 --> 01:16:00.522
- Brilliant.
- You'd better be telling the truth,

01:16:00.631 --> 01:16:01.893
you two-faced dog.

01:16:01.999 --> 01:16:04.968
I can get you one of them, actually.
Very good guard dogs.

01:16:05.068 --> 01:16:07.229
They can watch the back
and the front door at the same time.

01:16:07.337 --> 01:16:08.304
I can get you anything you want.

01:16:08.405 --> 01:16:11.067
What are the chances of getting
a Babylon candle?

01:16:11.174 --> 01:16:12.607
That one's slim.

01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:17.167
Although, I did know a girl once,
if you know what I mean...

01:16:17.278 --> 01:16:18.370
I'm a ladies' man.

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:19.879
...who had a sister...

01:16:19.981 --> 01:16:21.039
I think it was a woman.

01:16:21.149 --> 01:16:24.880
Oh, she was terrible.
Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

01:16:24.986 --> 01:16:26.180
Enough.

01:16:43.471 --> 01:16:46.201
Hold on tight!
The Captain's at the helm!

01:17:38.727 --> 01:17:41.457
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

01:17:41.563 --> 01:17:45.055
Good luck on your journey home,
Yvaine, wherever that may be.

01:17:45.166 --> 01:17:48.135
And good luck to you, Tristan,
with your Victoria.

01:17:48.903 --> 01:17:50.734
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough
for your kindness?

01:17:50.839 --> 01:17:54.434
Don't mention it.
No, seriously, don't mention it.

01:17:54.542 --> 01:17:58.569
Reputations, you know.
A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

01:18:00.982 --> 01:18:03.917
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

01:18:07.088 --> 01:18:08.851
Just think about it.

01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:17.029
Well, give my regards to England.
It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

01:18:20.502 --> 01:18:23.767
Mind you don't wear that wench out,
Captain Tristan!

01:18:28.476 --> 01:18:30.376
What did he say to you?

01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:32.540
What did he say when?

01:18:32.647 --> 01:18:35.138
Just then. When he whispered to you.

01:18:36.651 --> 01:18:39.049
No... No, he... He was just saying
we should use the lightning

01:18:39.152 --> 01:18:41.382
to get you a Babylon candle.

01:18:41.487 --> 01:18:43.421
Barter for it, you know.

01:18:44.624 --> 01:18:48.185
For the last time, where is the girl?

01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:52.326
The girl with the stone!
Where did she go?

01:18:53.432 --> 01:18:55.559
- Are you mocking me?
- No...

01:18:55.668 --> 01:18:59.160
'Cause if you are, believe me,
you have seconds to live!

01:19:04.143 --> 01:19:05.576
What a freak.

01:19:05.912 --> 01:19:08.437
Clean this thoroughly.

01:19:16.656 --> 01:19:17.953
Bollocks.

01:19:20.226 --> 01:19:22.922
If you have quite finished
squandering your magic

01:19:23.029 --> 01:19:25.520
on your rather
counterproductive beauty routine,

01:19:25.631 --> 01:19:27.895
you might like to know that
the star has returned.

01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:29.365
She's back on land.

01:19:29.468 --> 01:19:32.835
I know, damn it.
I couldn't reach the lake in time.

01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:37.308
No matter. We have found her.
She is on the road to the village of Wall.

01:19:37.410 --> 01:19:39.935
If you take the shortcut
across the marshes,

01:19:40.046 --> 01:19:41.911
you should arrive in time
to intercept her.

01:19:50.890 --> 01:19:52.118
Yvaine.

01:19:55.962 --> 01:19:58.055
- Are you trying to break my leg again?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:19:58.164 --> 01:20:01.099
I just... I can't risk people seeing you.
I don't trust anyone.

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.861
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:07.929
Yvaine. We're making good time.
Just leave it a minute.

01:20:14.914 --> 01:20:16.643
Aren't you tempted?

01:20:19.752 --> 01:20:21.481
Tempted? By what?

01:20:23.289 --> 01:20:24.688
Lmmortality.

01:20:25.725 --> 01:20:27.590
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.459
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

01:20:33.165 --> 01:20:35.861
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

01:20:39.972 --> 01:20:44.341
I mean, even if I could...
Everlasting life?

01:20:46.479 --> 01:20:49.039
I imagine it would be kind of lonely.

01:20:51.284 --> 01:20:52.376
Well,

01:20:54.186 --> 01:20:56.950
maybe if you had someone
to share it with.

01:20:58.124 --> 01:20:59.716
Someone you love.

01:21:00.126 --> 01:21:02.524
Maybe then it might be different.

01:21:05.729 --> 01:21:07.856
Come on, I think we're safe.

01:21:29.987 --> 01:21:33.684
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare
has a fearsome reputation.

01:23:01.945 --> 01:23:04.539
- What the hell is this?
- What are you doing here?

01:23:04.648 --> 01:23:06.741
My name is Prince Septimus.

01:23:07.985 --> 01:23:10.749
And you're going to tell me
where I can find the girl.

01:23:18.062 --> 01:23:23.466
All right, twinkletoes.
I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

01:23:39.815 --> 01:23:44.479
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes.
I just noticed it. Is it normal?

01:23:44.586 --> 01:23:47.680
Let's see if you can work it out
for yourself.

01:23:47.789 --> 01:23:49.586
What do stars do?

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:52.786
Attract trouble?

01:23:54.896 --> 01:23:57.194
That's... All right, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:23:57.299 --> 01:23:58.857
All right, let me... Let me...
Do I get another guess?

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:04.062
Is it... Do they know exactly how
to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

01:24:08.343 --> 01:24:11.608
- How long will that take?
- Maybe two days.

01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:15.444
But we don't have two days.
Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:19.312
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:28.489
- Nice cup of Earl Grey.
- Get out, everybody. Get out.

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:30.565
Did he hurt you, Captain?

01:24:32.267 --> 01:24:35.600
Did you tell him
where your nephew and the girl went?

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.502
So what's the problem?

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.469
It's my reputation.

01:24:42.978 --> 01:24:45.242
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:47.178
It's all right, Captain.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.384
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:57.385
- You'll always be our captain, Captain.
- Aye, aye, Captain.

01:25:02.864 --> 01:25:03.831
Captain.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:05.923
Yeah. Let's go, let's go.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:14.973
Prince Septimus,
your men, they're dead.

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.441
Oh, really?

01:25:18.346 --> 01:25:19.506
Go on!

01:25:32.627 --> 01:25:35.494
I met that woman.
She's friends with the Captain.

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:37.292
He said she trades at the market
near Wall.

01:25:37.399 --> 01:25:39.390
- We could hitch a lift.
- Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

01:25:39.501 --> 01:25:40.729
- You sure?
- Yes, yes.

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:45.369
Wait! Sorry!
My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

01:25:45.473 --> 01:25:47.100
That's my flower.

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:50.900
Eighteen years
I've been looking for that.

01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:52.637
Give it to me now!

01:25:53.379 --> 01:25:56.439
How dare you?
That was a gift from his mother!

01:25:58.084 --> 01:25:59.949
Perhaps I was mistaken.

01:26:01.254 --> 01:26:02.778
It's all right.

01:26:03.323 --> 01:26:05.416
It's obviously very valuable to you,
so you can have it

01:26:05.525 --> 01:26:07.049
in exchange for what I need.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.219
- A Babylon candle?
- And safe passage to the wall.

01:26:09.329 --> 01:26:11.160
A Babylon candle?

01:26:11.264 --> 01:26:15.200
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't deal in black magic.

01:26:15.301 --> 01:26:16.495
Really?

01:26:17.136 --> 01:26:19.604
Well, can you give us a lift then?
To the wall?

01:26:19.706 --> 01:26:22.732
Well, why didn't you say so
in the first place?

01:26:24.777 --> 01:26:27.541
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

01:26:27.814 --> 01:26:29.975
- Food and lodging on the way?
- Safe passage.

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:32.415
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

01:26:32.518 --> 01:26:35.578
in the exact same condition
that you're in now.

01:26:41.194 --> 01:26:43.788
Do you have any idea what
manner of thing it was that you had?

01:26:43.896 --> 01:26:45.887
Some kind of lucky charm?

01:26:46.366 --> 01:26:49.597
A very lucky charm indeed. Protection.

01:26:50.436 --> 01:26:55.203
In fact, the exact same thing that
would've prevented me from doing this.

01:26:59.612 --> 01:27:02.308
- Oh, my God! What did you do?
- Much better.

01:27:02.415 --> 01:27:06.215
<i>You shall not see the star, touch it,
smell or hear it.</i>

01:27:06.586 --> 01:27:10.113
Though I'll keep me word.
You shall not be harmed.

01:27:19.065 --> 01:27:22.660
There.
Food and lodging just as I promised.

01:27:22.769 --> 01:27:26.899
Would I be correct in thinking that
you can neither see nor hear me?

01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:30.036
Then I'd like to tell you
that you smell of pee.

01:27:30.143 --> 01:27:31.906
You look like the wrong end of a dog.

01:27:32.011 --> 01:27:34.479
And I swear,
if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:36.741
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

01:27:55.968 --> 01:27:57.162
Tristan?

01:27:58.738 --> 01:28:01.536
If you can understand me,
look at me now.

01:28:30.067 --> 01:28:33.059
You know when I said
I knew little about love?

01:28:34.805 --> 01:28:36.705
Well, that wasn't true.

01:28:39.243 --> 01:28:41.177
I know a lot about love.

01:28:41.946 --> 01:28:45.382
I've seen it.
I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

01:28:47.184 --> 01:28:51.143
And it was the only thing that made
watching your world bearable.

01:28:52.356 --> 01:28:57.817
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

01:28:59.964 --> 01:29:03.263
Made me want to turn away
and never look down again.

01:29:05.403 --> 01:29:09.203
But to see the way that mankind loves.

01:29:10.408 --> 01:29:13.138
I mean, you could search
the furthest reaches of the universe

01:29:13.244 --> 01:29:16.077
and never find anything more beautiful.

01:29:18.983 --> 01:29:24.387
So, yes, I know that
love is unconditional.

01:29:26.023 --> 01:29:29.823
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

01:29:30.795 --> 01:29:36.427
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

01:29:38.402 --> 01:29:42.498
and, well,
strangely easy to mistake for loathing.

01:29:43.274 --> 01:29:44.241
And

01:29:46.610 --> 01:29:51.013
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

01:29:52.683 --> 01:29:54.412
I think I love you.

01:29:55.519 --> 01:30:01.219
My heart, it feels like
my chest can barely contain it.

01:30:03.060 --> 01:30:08.498
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore.
It belongs to you.

01:30:10.034 --> 01:30:14.266
And if you wanted it,
I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

01:30:15.573 --> 01:30:20.533
No gifts, no goods,
no demonstrations of devotion.

01:30:23.581 --> 01:30:26.175
Nothing but knowing you love me, too.

01:30:28.118 --> 01:30:29.642
Just your heart

01:30:31.722 --> 01:30:33.417
in exchange for mine.

01:30:42.898 --> 01:30:45.093
The wall is one mile that way.

01:30:45.901 --> 01:30:49.598
There. Though the walk might take
you a little longer than normal.

01:30:49.705 --> 01:30:53.801
Transformation tends to leave the brain
a bit scrambled for a while.

01:30:57.279 --> 01:30:58.610
You...

01:31:01.083 --> 01:31:03.449
I warned you. Save your strength.

01:31:04.419 --> 01:31:06.683
I've been so worried about you.

01:31:07.356 --> 01:31:08.584
Victoria.

01:31:09.625 --> 01:31:11.684
I think I preferred "Mother."

01:31:13.595 --> 01:31:18.157
Come on. There's an inn over there.
Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

01:31:19.201 --> 01:31:20.668
I think you need a bath
and a good night's sleep

01:31:20.769 --> 01:31:23.033
before you present me to her.

01:31:23.138 --> 01:31:24.765
Come on. Come.

01:31:27.142 --> 01:31:30.043
- Come on, Tristan. It's not that far.
- Okay.

01:31:51.567 --> 01:31:53.262
Excuse me?

01:31:53.368 --> 01:31:56.599
- I think you're in my bath.
- Well, close your eyes!

01:31:58.140 --> 01:32:02.270
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not looking.
Here, I'll turn away.

01:32:07.249 --> 01:32:09.615
All right, you can open them now.

01:32:17.359 --> 01:32:20.487
Did you really mean
what you said in the caravan?

01:32:22.531 --> 01:32:23.793
What I...

01:32:23.899 --> 01:32:26.925
But... But you were a mouse!

01:32:27.369 --> 01:32:30.532
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese!
You didn't...

01:32:30.639 --> 01:32:32.470
I asked you to give me a sign.

01:32:32.574 --> 01:32:36.738
And risk you being too embarrassed
to keep saying such lovely things?

01:32:42.084 --> 01:32:45.645
You want to know what the Captain
really whispered to me that day?

01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:52.586
He told me that my true love
was right in front of my eyes.

01:32:54.796 --> 01:32:56.423
And he was right.

01:33:11.211 --> 01:33:14.112
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on,
you got to come up and see this!

01:33:14.214 --> 01:33:15.647
No, thank you.

01:33:16.383 --> 01:33:18.442
- Pervert!
- Suit yourself.

01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:23.821
- Ironic, isn't it?
- Yeah. What is?

01:33:24.457 --> 01:33:26.516
Septimus will be here by the morning,

01:33:26.626 --> 01:33:30.392
find the girl, get the stone
and be king forever.

01:33:30.497 --> 01:33:31.828
So unjust.

01:33:32.432 --> 01:33:34.730
Still, at least we will be free.

01:33:37.504 --> 01:33:40.837
You're very close.
She's in the market town.

01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:43.238
One mile from the gap in the wall.

01:33:43.343 --> 01:33:45.402
You speak as if this is good news.

01:33:45.512 --> 01:33:49.448
Do I need to remind you that Wall
is not part of our universe?

01:33:49.549 --> 01:33:52.109
If she crosses the threshold
into the human realm,

01:33:52.218 --> 01:33:56.245
our star becomes nothing more
than a pitted lump of metallic rock.

01:33:56.756 --> 01:33:59.156
Then I suggest you hurry up!

01:34:30.323 --> 01:34:31.483
What?

01:34:32.492 --> 01:34:33.652
Oh, what do you want?

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:36.888
Sorry.
Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

01:34:36.996 --> 01:34:39.863
Ask me again
at a more reasonable hour.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:41.058
No, I can't. I have to go.

01:34:41.167 --> 01:34:43.397
Look,
if my friend wakes up before I get back,

01:34:43.503 --> 01:34:45.971
- please, can you give her a message?
- Go on.

01:35:22.575 --> 01:35:26.202
You know, that's the first time
I've ever slept at night.

01:35:27.545 --> 01:35:29.240
I can't believe it.

01:35:33.618 --> 01:35:34.607
Tristan?

01:35:43.895 --> 01:35:45.658
Have you seen my friend?

01:35:45.763 --> 01:35:47.663
He left absurdly early.

01:35:48.866 --> 01:35:50.094
He left?

01:35:50.201 --> 01:35:53.432
He told me to tell you
he's gone to see Victoria

01:35:53.538 --> 01:35:56.439
because he's sorry,
but he's found his true love

01:35:56.541 --> 01:35:59.669
and he wants to spend
the rest of his life with her.

01:36:00.745 --> 01:36:01.837
What?

01:36:02.847 --> 01:36:05.315
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

01:36:34.745 --> 01:36:37.612
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

01:37:21.225 --> 01:37:22.715
Happy birthday.

01:37:23.694 --> 01:37:24.991
Tristan.

01:37:26.964 --> 01:37:28.727
What happened to you?

01:37:30.134 --> 01:37:31.761
I found the star.

01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:35.805
I can't believe you did it.

01:37:35.907 --> 01:37:38.375
Where's my star? Can I see it?

01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:41.535
- Is it beautiful?
- Yes.

01:37:43.781 --> 01:37:45.749
Well, it's awfully small.

01:37:46.717 --> 01:37:49.741
Well, that's just a little piece.
A token for your birthday.

01:37:49.852 --> 01:37:52.650
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

01:37:53.956 --> 01:37:56.151
It's not the star that I want.

01:37:58.594 --> 01:38:00.357
You know what I want.

01:38:02.564 --> 01:38:04.395
Yeah. I do.

01:38:09.672 --> 01:38:13.608
You want to grow up
and get over yourself.

01:38:18.414 --> 01:38:20.041
- Humphrey.
- Thorn.

01:38:20.582 --> 01:38:22.675
You must have a death wish.

01:38:30.693 --> 01:38:33.491
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

01:38:34.129 --> 01:38:35.790
She's all yours.

01:38:35.898 --> 01:38:38.458
You really are a perfect couple.
The best of luck to you both.

01:38:38.567 --> 01:38:43.197
Well, why would I want this?
It's just a measly handful of stardust!

01:38:48.744 --> 01:38:49.870
Yvaine?

01:38:52.014 --> 01:38:53.948
She can't cross the wall.

01:39:02.691 --> 01:39:03.715
Go on!

01:40:11.226 --> 01:40:14.159
Stop! Stop!
If you go through there, you'll die!

01:40:14.261 --> 01:40:15.319
What?

01:40:17.497 --> 01:40:20.694
If you set foot on human soil,
you'll turn to rock.

01:40:21.268 --> 01:40:24.760
Wretched slattern!
Where have you taken me?

01:40:34.114 --> 01:40:36.605
Planning to enter Wall, were you?

01:40:36.716 --> 01:40:41.119
If death is what you wish, my dear,
I'd be more than happy to assist you.

01:40:41.455 --> 01:40:43.355
Are you talking to me?

01:40:44.091 --> 01:40:45.718
You. Small world.

01:40:46.726 --> 01:40:50.059
Anyhow, no, I wasn't.
I was talking to the star.

01:40:50.564 --> 01:40:51.861
What star?

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.097
My slave girl's no star.
Any fool can see that.

01:40:57.637 --> 01:41:00.265
If she was,
I'd have had the heart out of her chest

01:41:00.373 --> 01:41:02.898
a long time ago, trust me.

01:41:03.310 --> 01:41:06.711
Trust you? Not a mistake
I'd be likely to make again.

01:41:07.380 --> 01:41:10.781
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal?
Heads or tails?

01:41:40.814 --> 01:41:44.875
- Oh, God. Time to go.
- She's not going anywhere.

01:41:45.018 --> 01:41:46.883
I think you'll find she is.

01:41:46.987 --> 01:41:49.353
It's all right. You can come, too.

01:41:52.259 --> 01:41:56.320
You can ride in the carriage or
be dragged behind it. Your choice.

01:42:16.216 --> 01:42:17.513
What happened?

01:42:17.617 --> 01:42:19.949
Be my guest. I quit.

01:42:20.053 --> 01:42:23.045
Eighty years
I've stopped you people going out.

01:42:23.156 --> 01:42:25.021
What I should have been worrying about

01:42:25.125 --> 01:42:26.615
was those people
from the other side coming in.

01:42:26.726 --> 01:42:28.387
All right,
just tell me what happened!

01:42:28.495 --> 01:42:30.360
What happened? Oh, where to start?

01:42:31.731 --> 01:42:32.698
No!

01:42:46.711 --> 01:42:47.905
Come on!

01:43:17.809 --> 01:43:18.935
Go on!

01:43:49.574 --> 01:43:50.802
The star!

01:43:51.409 --> 01:43:52.376
And who else?

01:43:52.477 --> 01:43:55.605
A slave for us. It will be nice to
have someone to help mop up

01:43:55.713 --> 01:43:57.908
when we've finished with our little guest.

01:43:58.016 --> 01:43:59.415
Oh, good work, sister.

01:43:59.517 --> 01:44:02.418
And just in time, I see! You look awful!

01:45:01.444 --> 01:45:02.843
Who are you?

01:45:04.146 --> 01:45:06.444
What business do you have here?

01:45:07.883 --> 01:45:09.145
Septimus?

01:45:09.685 --> 01:45:11.778
I knew your brother, Primus.

01:45:13.122 --> 01:45:15.647
Unless you wish to meet him
in the afterlife,

01:45:15.758 --> 01:45:18.420
I suggest you answer my question.
What are you doing here?

01:45:18.527 --> 01:45:20.825
I might ask you the same thing.

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:39.445
There are four of them.

01:45:42.418 --> 01:45:45.148
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

01:45:45.254 --> 01:45:47.745
Wait.
How do I know you can be trusted?

01:45:47.857 --> 01:45:50.451
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

01:45:50.559 --> 01:45:52.550
- No.
- Well, then, let's go.

01:45:59.969 --> 01:46:03.564
Get off me! Get off!

01:46:07.810 --> 01:46:10.005
- Una?
- Septimus.

01:46:10.112 --> 01:46:11.579
- Una!
- Sister!

01:46:30.332 --> 01:46:32.197
Tristan! No! Tristan!

01:46:33.436 --> 01:46:36.132
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

01:46:37.373 --> 01:46:38.931
I'm your mother.

01:47:15.644 --> 01:47:18.238
- Rather well.
- Good riddance to you. Yes.

01:47:57.851 --> 01:48:00.046
Let's put out those flames.

01:48:00.487 --> 01:48:01.784
Shall we?

01:48:52.506 --> 01:48:54.371
So, what happens now?

01:48:55.175 --> 01:48:57.575
We have to learn to live with each other.

01:48:57.678 --> 01:48:58.872
Forever?

01:49:04.384 --> 01:49:06.147
Let's get on with it.

01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:12.081
Be the man that I know you are.

01:49:29.876 --> 01:49:31.173
- Get outside.
- Okay.

01:49:31.278 --> 01:49:32.267
Go.

01:49:42.456 --> 01:49:44.321
- Tristan!
- Get him.

01:50:19.991 --> 01:50:21.253
Get off!

01:50:25.397 --> 01:50:27.126
Get out!

01:51:04.302 --> 01:51:08.762
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming?
Frog or tadpole?

01:52:06.831 --> 01:52:08.059
Septimus?

01:53:30.179 --> 01:53:31.339
Tristan!

01:54:15.157 --> 01:54:16.454
Youth.

01:54:17.393 --> 01:54:18.690
Beauty.

01:54:20.496 --> 01:54:22.930
It all seems meaningless now.

01:54:23.633 --> 01:54:25.601
My sisters are dead!

01:54:27.236 --> 01:54:30.899
Everything I cared about gone.

01:54:37.077 --> 01:54:38.169
Go.

01:54:43.651 --> 01:54:44.948
Go!

01:55:05.973 --> 01:55:06.940
No!

01:56:04.064 --> 01:56:05.998
I owe you thanks, boy.

01:56:06.433 --> 01:56:09.527
What use was her heart to me
when it was broken?

01:56:09.970 --> 01:56:14.873
And you got rid of my sisters
and now I can have it all for myself.

01:56:20.748 --> 01:56:23.774
- Hold me tight and close your eyes.
- What? Why?

01:56:24.551 --> 01:56:26.178
What do stars do?

01:56:32.993 --> 01:56:34.153
Shine.

01:57:10.395 --> 01:57:12.056
- Bravo!
- Yeah!

01:57:12.464 --> 01:57:13.761
Very good.

01:57:15.534 --> 01:57:17.058
Why didn't you do that earlier?

01:57:17.169 --> 01:57:21.799
I couldn't have done that without you.
No star can shine with a broken heart.

01:57:23.208 --> 01:57:25.073
I thought I'd lost you.

01:57:26.344 --> 01:57:28.141
But you came back.

01:57:28.547 --> 01:57:30.845
Of course I did. I love you.

01:57:36.421 --> 01:57:37.649
Come on.

01:57:57.742 --> 01:57:59.039
Tristan.

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.272
The last surviving male heir
of the Stormhold bloodline.

01:58:08.053 --> 01:58:09.680
It's you, Tristan.

01:58:13.558 --> 01:58:16.550
But if he's the new King of Stormhold,
then...

01:59:03.642 --> 01:59:08.136
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

01:59:25.528 --> 01:59:26.927
Yeah!

01:59:42.845 --> 01:59:44.472
My gift to you.

01:59:46.282 --> 01:59:47.681
To you both.

01:59:47.984 --> 01:59:49.315
Thank you.

02:00:04.267 --> 02:00:06.827
<i>They ruled for 80 years.</i>

02:00:08.071 --> 02:00:11.006
<i>But no man can live forever,</i>

02:00:11.908 --> 02:00:15.309
<i>except he who possesses
the heart of a star.</i>

02:00:16.212 --> 02:00:20.615
<i>And Yvaine had given hers
to Tristan completely.</i>

02:00:22.185 --> 02:00:25.484
<i>When their children and grandchildren
were grown,</i>

02:00:26.522 --> 02:00:29.753
<i>it was time to light the Babylon candle.</i>

02:00:35.832 --> 02:00:40.269
<i>And they still live happily ever after.</i>
