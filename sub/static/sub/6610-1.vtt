00:29.560 --> 00:33.155
<i>Listen! We're not sure</i>
<i>what caused the collapse.</i>

00:33.264 --> 00:36.392
<i>Our boys were working the north end</i>
<i>of Tunnel 5 when she gave.</i>

00:36.501 --> 00:39.561
<i>But I can assure you,</i>
<i>we here at the Hanniger Mines</i>

00:39.670 --> 00:42.969
<i>are doing everything</i>
<i>in our power to get them out alive.</i>

00:44.075 --> 00:46.202
<i>Calm down, folks!</i>

00:46.310 --> 00:48.301
<i>It's a routine questioning.</i>

00:48.412 --> 00:50.846
<i>Tom was the last man</i>
<i>to leave the mine that night.</i>

00:50.948 --> 00:54.111
<i>Maybe he could shine</i>
<i>a light on the situation.</i>

00:54.218 --> 00:56.345
<i>Tom Hanniger is responsible</i>
<i>for the collapse,</i>

00:56.454 --> 00:58.285
<i>but it was an accident.</i>

00:58.389 --> 01:01.825
<i>And that's the thing we have to remember.</i>
<i>It was an accident.</i>

01:01.926 --> 01:03.154
<i>This morning, at around 5 a.m.,</i>

01:03.261 --> 01:06.059
<i>we recovered five bodies</i>
<i>and one survivor.</i>

01:06.164 --> 01:08.758
<i>Harry Warden was the only survivor.</i>

01:08.866 --> 01:12.768
<i>When he arrived at the county hospital,</i>
<i>he was delusional, violent...</i>

01:12.870 --> 01:15.168
<i>The five miners that died were all killed</i>

01:15.273 --> 01:18.606
<i>by the blunt force of</i>
<i>a pickaxe, not the cave-in.</i>

01:20.711 --> 01:23.236
<i>It was no accident killed those men.</i>

01:23.347 --> 01:25.008
<i>It was Harry Warden.</i>

01:25.116 --> 01:27.676
<i>He murdered those miners</i>
<i>buried alive with him</i>

01:27.785 --> 01:29.912
<i>to conserve his own goddamn air.</i>

01:30.021 --> 01:34.287
<i>Evidence suggests</i>
<i>Harry killed each of them with a pickaxe.</i>

01:34.392 --> 01:35.984
<i>Blood was found</i>
<i>on Harry Warden's pickaxe.</i>

01:36.093 --> 01:37.321
<i>Look, chances are very slim</i>

01:37.428 --> 01:39.419
<i>that Warden will ever</i>
<i>come out of his coma.</i>

01:39.530 --> 01:42.363
<i>Let's hope God doesn't waste any miracles</i>
<i>on Harry Warden.</i>

02:08.092 --> 02:10.458
We'll rescue Trainor down below.

02:10.561 --> 02:12.153
You, venom, and methane in 5, right?

02:12.263 --> 02:13.594
I know my job, Harry.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.325
Like fuck you do, Hanniger.

02:15.433 --> 02:18.766
Just 'cause your daddy owns the mine
doesn't mean you know shit.

02:19.971 --> 02:21.029
- You hear that?
- Oh, my God!

02:21.138 --> 02:23.402
Damn kids! Everyone out now!

04:29.500 --> 04:31.832
Happy fucking Valentine's Day.

04:33.237 --> 04:35.569
Sheriff Burke.

04:35.673 --> 04:37.163
Over here.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.745
Think I waited too long to retire.

04:48.853 --> 04:51.378
You and me both, Hinch.

04:51.489 --> 04:52.387
Who did this?

04:52.490 --> 04:54.185
Harry Warden.

04:55.559 --> 04:57.925
Harry Warden's in a coma.

04:58.028 --> 04:59.757
Guess he woke up.

05:04.735 --> 05:06.635
Where the hell is he headed?

05:23.621 --> 05:25.384
Come on, Irene.

05:25.489 --> 05:26.786
Everybody's already moving underground.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.654
Don't you think it's
about time we joined them?

05:29.994 --> 05:32.554
I told you I gotta wait for Sarah and Tom.

05:32.663 --> 05:34.688
I promised.

05:34.799 --> 05:36.289
Christ.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.095
Hasn't she broken up
with that loser yet?

05:38.202 --> 05:42.161
Sorry to tell you, sweetie,
but Tom's the love of her life.

05:42.273 --> 05:45.504
Yeah, whatever. If that pussy
has the balls to show up here again,

05:45.609 --> 05:48.601
- I will personally kick his ass.
- Yeah, right.

06:10.801 --> 06:11.790
Hey, guys.

06:11.902 --> 06:13.062
Thanks for waiting.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.831
Yeah, Axel was just
about ready to give up,

06:14.939 --> 06:15.667
but I knew you would come!

06:15.773 --> 06:18.674
- Axel. Hey.
- Hey, Sarah.

06:18.776 --> 06:20.903
Okay, so before we go in... snapshot.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.808
No. I don't think so.

06:22.913 --> 06:24.244
- Come on.
- Come on.

06:24.348 --> 06:25.315
- Sure?
- Yeah.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.043
Because you guys
look so cute together.

06:28.552 --> 06:30.520
Okay. Say "Over-the-pants hand job."

06:33.123 --> 06:34.681
You guys want one?

06:34.792 --> 06:35.952
No, we're good. Come on.

06:36.060 --> 06:36.958
Let's go.

06:37.061 --> 06:38.028
All right.

06:39.129 --> 06:40.494
Okay?

06:45.369 --> 06:46.996
- You ready to party?
- Oh, yeah.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.834
Hey. Hey.

06:52.943 --> 06:55.741
We don't have to go in there,
Tom, if you don't want to go.

06:55.846 --> 06:58.440
I can't believe you wouldn't
take a picture of us.

06:58.549 --> 07:00.642
- Just stop, all right?
- What, stop? What do you mean?

07:00.751 --> 07:02.218
It's not like I won't
take a picture with you.

07:02.319 --> 07:04.014
I just won't take a picture
with that asshole.

07:04.121 --> 07:05.088
What's up, Bruce?

07:05.189 --> 07:06.656
What? What is it about Tom...

07:08.826 --> 07:10.088
That's what you get.

07:10.194 --> 07:11.991
It's fine.

07:12.096 --> 07:13.586
It's fine. Everybody's here.

07:13.697 --> 07:14.721
You wanted to be here.

07:14.832 --> 07:17.494
Do you want to be here?

07:17.601 --> 07:19.034
Yeah. Yes.

07:20.170 --> 07:21.159
Sure?

07:21.272 --> 07:22.296
Yes.

07:24.208 --> 07:25.106
I love you.

07:25.209 --> 07:26.369
I love you, too.

07:31.148 --> 07:33.776
I left the beer in the car.
Here. Take this.

07:33.884 --> 07:36.580
- I'll go up and catch up with you.
- Want me to go?

07:36.687 --> 07:38.177
No.

07:38.289 --> 07:39.256
Go ahead.

07:44.595 --> 07:45.994
Hey, guys!

07:52.836 --> 07:54.394
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't get lost.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.030
Axel?

08:01.078 --> 08:02.136
Irene?

08:03.948 --> 08:05.779
Where are you guys?

08:36.647 --> 08:37.739
Oh, God.

08:42.019 --> 08:43.919
What, you think I was
Harry Warden or something?

08:44.020 --> 08:45.045
Hey, Michael! Check this out...

10:03.467 --> 10:05.094
Hello?

10:11.041 --> 10:12.941
Jason?

10:16.580 --> 10:17.911
Jason, is that you?

10:20.484 --> 10:22.213
Come on, dude! You're scaring me!

10:25.689 --> 10:27.316
Come on.

10:27.424 --> 10:28.857
Okay.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.256
I'm out of here.

11:12.536 --> 11:14.868
Fuck you! Fuck you! Do you hear me?

11:45.769 --> 11:47.134
- Sarah!
- They're dead!

11:47.237 --> 11:48.226
They're all dead!

11:48.338 --> 11:49.930
Come on! Come on! Come on!

11:50.040 --> 11:51.132
Let's go! Hurry up!

11:51.241 --> 11:52.208
Come on!

11:57.447 --> 11:59.176
Sarah! Faster! Faster!

12:00.584 --> 12:02.779
Come on! Come on! Come on!

12:02.886 --> 12:05.480
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

12:05.589 --> 12:07.056
- Don't leave him!
- Come on.

12:13.330 --> 12:16.265
- No! No!
- Come back!

13:33.110 --> 13:35.010
No. No. N...

13:46.189 --> 13:47.451
Stay down, Harry.

13:54.264 --> 13:56.630
Stay down, Harry!

14:23.126 --> 14:24.093
Tom?

14:25.996 --> 14:27.793
Tom. You all right?

14:27.898 --> 14:29.559
Hey, Sheriff! Come on!

14:31.635 --> 14:32.966
Stay with him.

14:34.504 --> 14:36.028
Let's go, idiot.

14:53.023 --> 14:54.354
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

14:54.458 --> 14:57.393
<i>Harmony, this small-town slice</i>
<i>of Norman Rockwell,</i>

14:57.494 --> 14:59.462
<i>is the murder capital of America.</i>

14:59.563 --> 15:01.588
<i>The Valentine's Day</i>
<i>celebration approaches,</i>

15:01.698 --> 15:03.029
<i>and it's been nearly 10 years</i>

15:03.133 --> 15:06.432
<i>since this God-fearing community</i>
<i>was shaken to its core</i>

15:06.536 --> 15:09.903
<i>when local miner Harry Warden</i>
<i>went on a killing spree,</i>

15:10.007 --> 15:12.771
<i>taking the lives of 22 men,</i>
<i>women, and children</i>

15:12.876 --> 15:16.642
<i>before being buried alive in</i>
<i>the very mine he once worked.</i>

15:16.747 --> 15:19.341
<i>But after a decade,</i>
<i>have the residents of Harmony</i>

15:19.449 --> 15:21.474
<i>been able to recover from the trauma?</i>

15:21.585 --> 15:25.077
<i>I'm here with County Sheriff Axel Palmer,</i>
<i>who has this to say.</i>

15:25.188 --> 15:27.247
<i>What happened was a long time ago.</i>

15:27.357 --> 15:29.154
<i>We're all just trying to move on.</i>

15:29.259 --> 15:31.454
<i>Sheriff, do you ever worry</i>
<i>that these horrific events</i>

15:31.561 --> 15:33.461
<i>might repeat themselves?</i>

15:33.563 --> 15:37.260
<i>Well, I know you in the media</i>
<i>would just love that to happen.</i>

15:37.367 --> 15:39.460
<i>You know, why don't you people just stop</i>
<i>coming back here every year,</i>

15:39.569 --> 15:40.729
<i>hoping for some kind of...</i>

15:40.837 --> 15:42.464
<i>some kind of fucking horror show,</i>

15:42.572 --> 15:44.563
<i>to mark the stupidest [bleep]ing holiday</i>

15:44.674 --> 15:46.938
<i>a greeting card company ever invented?</i>

15:47.044 --> 15:50.810
Eloquent, Sheriff. You make us look
like an inbred mining community.

15:52.482 --> 15:54.040
We are an inbred mining
community, Ben.

15:54.151 --> 15:56.984
So you got any coffee in this joint?

15:57.087 --> 15:58.111
What's so funny?

15:58.221 --> 16:01.622
Your boss. County Sheriff Axel Palmer.

16:01.725 --> 16:04.285
If only your old man could see you now.

16:04.394 --> 16:05.986
I don't know.

16:06.096 --> 16:08.826
That's one intensely good-looking
son of a bitch, if you ask me.

16:08.932 --> 16:10.058
I should have my own reality show.

16:10.167 --> 16:11.566
Yeah, I'm sure your exploits

16:11.668 --> 16:14.398
arresting hardened bicycle thieves
would be a big hit.

16:14.504 --> 16:16.062
- Yeah.
- Hey, Sarah.

16:16.173 --> 16:19.165
Hey, sweetie. Hey, don't forget
to pick up Noah's soccer gear tonight.

16:19.276 --> 16:21.039
Yeah. I'll take care of it.

16:22.379 --> 16:24.404
Hey, you missed me on TV.

16:24.514 --> 16:27.881
Oh, yes! That's right! How was he?

16:27.984 --> 16:30.043
When you gonna dump this bum
and run away with me?

16:30.153 --> 16:31.620
I get off work at 8.

16:31.721 --> 16:34.815
Well, I'll be sure to tuck the top down
on my Cadillac.

16:34.925 --> 16:37.485
Ben. Come on. I'm sitting right here.

16:46.336 --> 16:48.201
Sarah? I've got a doctor's appointment.

16:48.305 --> 16:50.068
Is it okay if I come in late today?

16:50.173 --> 16:51.834
Yeah. Get there when you can.

17:01.685 --> 17:06.054
Well, gentlemen,
I got some Huffy vans to track down.

17:06.156 --> 17:08.556
You want me to come with?

17:08.657 --> 17:11.286
No. No, you can hang tight, Martin.
Finish your coffee.

17:11.394 --> 17:13.224
I'll call you if I need backup.

17:29.913 --> 17:33.041
This place gives me the creeps.

17:33.150 --> 17:35.209
Can we meet in a motel next time?

17:35.318 --> 17:36.979
Yeah, that's a great idea.

17:37.087 --> 17:39.521
We'll just pull up and check in.

17:45.095 --> 17:47.928
I don't think anybody would notice
a sheriff's car parked out front.

17:48.031 --> 17:49.999
Maybe one day, you'll tell your wife.

17:52.969 --> 17:54.027
Maybe.

17:59.643 --> 18:03.079
I figure you'll be with Sarah
on Valentine's, so...

18:15.725 --> 18:16.692
I...

18:17.861 --> 18:19.556
I didn't get you anything.

18:19.663 --> 18:20.789
You don't need to.

18:22.532 --> 18:23.829
You already have.

18:26.336 --> 18:27.496
I'm pregnant.

20:02.299 --> 20:03.698
Tom. What are you doing here?

20:03.800 --> 20:05.461
What do you mean?
I'm here to sign the papers.

20:05.568 --> 20:06.830
They moved the signing to Monday.

20:06.936 --> 20:08.733
They moved it to Monday. Great.

20:08.838 --> 20:10.931
Well, you're here now.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.406
Want to come in and have a drink?

20:12.509 --> 20:13.908
Yeah. Okay.

20:18.081 --> 20:19.605
We missed you at the funeral.

20:19.716 --> 20:22.685
Of course, your father missed you
long before that.

20:25.955 --> 20:27.889
Oh, he could have found me
if he wanted to.

20:27.991 --> 20:30.551
You know, he'd kick your ass
if he knew you were selling the mine.

20:30.660 --> 20:32.890
- It is what it is, Ben.
- Bullshit.

20:32.996 --> 20:36.193
That mine is Harmony's life blood, Tom.

20:36.299 --> 20:38.460
We're talking families here.

20:38.568 --> 20:41.036
I was assured that everyone
would get severance

20:41.137 --> 20:44.163
and that the more experienced men,
like yourself, would be kept on.

20:44.274 --> 20:46.333
For how long? Three months?

20:46.443 --> 20:48.001
That's not my problem.

20:48.111 --> 20:50.272
No! It's my fucking problem.

20:50.380 --> 20:53.474
Those mines have been
outdated since I was a kid.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.778
But my father

20:55.885 --> 20:57.580
was just too stubborn to see it,
and you know that.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.353
So that's what all this is about.

21:03.793 --> 21:05.420
All right.

21:09.165 --> 21:11.725
If you need to make
peace with your daddy...

21:17.307 --> 21:18.740
there he is.

21:22.746 --> 21:24.145
I'm majority shareholder.

21:24.247 --> 21:26.909
And I'm selling the mine.

21:27.016 --> 21:28.677
And that's all there is to it.

21:30.653 --> 21:32.883
Your dad and I protected those men!

21:32.989 --> 21:37.983
Selling the mine won't sit well
with anyone in this town.

21:40.296 --> 21:42.457
Well, come Monday, I'm gone.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.752
Louis! Get back here this instant!

22:04.854 --> 22:06.287
Louis!

22:10.693 --> 22:13.719
- Is Mel around?
- God, I hope not.

22:13.830 --> 22:16.526
Mel has been dead for seven years.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.032
Trade you the pooch for a room.

22:18.134 --> 22:19.260
All right. Come.

22:42.425 --> 22:43.414
Yes!

22:46.963 --> 22:48.430
Oh, yeah!

22:48.531 --> 22:50.556
Oh, yes! Frank!

22:52.802 --> 22:54.463
Oh, my God. What's wrong?

22:54.571 --> 22:56.766
I look so hot today.

22:56.873 --> 22:58.534
Oh, yes...

23:12.021 --> 23:13.648
<i>Stay down, Harry!</i>

23:27.570 --> 23:29.003
So you gonna be okay to drive back,

23:29.105 --> 23:30.902
or do you want me to
put in for another night?

23:32.509 --> 23:34.101
I got a two-day haul to make

23:34.210 --> 23:37.441
in one day, if I'm gonna
get back by Valentine's.

23:37.547 --> 23:39.014
Ah, Valentine's.

23:40.283 --> 23:42.183
Did you know that St. Valentine

23:42.285 --> 23:44.344
- was a patron saint of love?
- Yeah.

23:44.454 --> 23:48.049
Yeah, the whole thing started in Rome
in, like, the year 500 or something.

23:48.157 --> 23:49.681
They would have this lottery,

23:49.792 --> 23:53.159
where young men would draw
teenage girls' names out of a box.

23:53.263 --> 23:55.493
Then that teenage girl
would become their secret

23:55.598 --> 23:58.328
sexual companion for
the whole rest of the year.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.561
That's where we got our
Valentine's Day cards from.

24:00.670 --> 24:03.036
Kind of romantic, in a sick
kind of way, isn't it?

24:03.139 --> 24:05.403
Uh, yeah.
It's, um, romantic.

24:06.976 --> 24:08.466
What'cha doing?

24:08.578 --> 24:09.602
Nothing. I got this.

24:09.712 --> 24:10.940
Frank?

24:12.715 --> 24:13.682
What the fuck is that?

24:15.385 --> 24:18.616
Irene, I make these for
my own personal collection.

24:18.721 --> 24:20.621
Look. I'II...

24:20.723 --> 24:21.690
I'll pay you?

24:21.791 --> 24:23.156
I am no hooker.

24:24.994 --> 24:25.961
You are now.

24:36.906 --> 24:37.930
Shit.

24:38.975 --> 24:39.942
Fuck.

24:59.395 --> 25:00.589
Frank!

25:01.864 --> 25:03.491
Frank, you son of a bitch!

25:03.600 --> 25:05.261
Irene.

25:06.669 --> 25:08.296
Put some clothes on
before some kid sees you.

25:08.404 --> 25:09.598
I don't give a shit about the clothes!

25:09.706 --> 25:11.970
Give me the fucking tapes,
or I swear...

25:12.075 --> 25:14.509
- I swear...
- Irene, two things.

25:14.611 --> 25:17.079
1, I don't want you anymore.

25:17.180 --> 25:19.478
And 2, I know the gun's not loaded.

25:19.582 --> 25:21.482
Fuck you, Frank!

25:22.652 --> 25:24.313
Oh, jeez! What...

25:24.420 --> 25:26.388
What are you doing?

25:28.057 --> 25:29.524
God!

25:41.671 --> 25:44.902
<i>Frank. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

26:02.659 --> 26:03.648
Oh, God.

26:05.995 --> 26:07.462
Oh, my God.

26:10.867 --> 26:12.095
Oh, my God.

27:03.820 --> 27:05.014
Louis?

27:05.121 --> 27:07.521
Where are you?

27:11.994 --> 27:15.452
Louis? Where are you?

27:17.567 --> 27:19.797
Louis, you little shit.

27:19.902 --> 27:23.338
Stop hiding from Mama.

27:27.410 --> 27:30.846
Louis, you are in such trouble.

27:33.116 --> 27:35.311
The closet.

27:35.418 --> 27:36.783
Honestly.

28:10.853 --> 28:12.411
Fuck you! Fuck you!

28:12.522 --> 28:13.853
Let go of me!

28:23.666 --> 28:24.633
No!

28:39.916 --> 28:42.180
What the fuck do you want?

28:45.454 --> 28:47.285
What do you want, motherfucker?

28:50.459 --> 28:51.483
No!

29:00.369 --> 29:01.859
Leave me alone!

29:26.863 --> 29:29.093
Jesus, Irene.

29:29.198 --> 29:31.029
He took your heart.

29:35.538 --> 29:37.768
Jilted lover with a screw loose?

29:37.874 --> 29:40.434
More than one screw,
wouldn't you say?

29:41.978 --> 29:43.639
Irene never did the jilting.

29:43.746 --> 29:44.678
I'm sorry, Sheriff.

29:44.780 --> 29:47.214
I know you two used to be an item.

29:47.316 --> 29:49.511
Yeah, it was a long time ago, Martin.

29:51.754 --> 29:53.312
We checked the motel registration.

29:53.422 --> 29:54.684
There's a couple of fakes.

29:54.790 --> 29:56.883
Not too many people use
their real name around here.

29:56.993 --> 29:58.392
If you know what I mean.

29:59.896 --> 30:02.729
All right. This name is real.

30:02.832 --> 30:03.856
Tom Hanniger?

30:03.966 --> 30:05.297
Sheriff, we got a video camera.

30:05.401 --> 30:06.800
You ain't gonna believe what's on it.

30:06.903 --> 30:09.736
Sarah, I'm sorry I'm late again.

30:09.839 --> 30:11.704
They found someone dead
at the Thunderbird.

30:11.807 --> 30:13.399
There's cops everywhere.

30:13.509 --> 30:15.101
Have you talked to Axel?

30:15.211 --> 30:16.200
Go stock the display.

30:20.816 --> 30:21.748
Hi.

30:21.851 --> 30:23.716
Tom?

30:23.819 --> 30:24.786
Sarah.

30:28.691 --> 30:30.124
You're still working for your folks, I see.

30:30.226 --> 30:31.318
Tom.

30:33.296 --> 30:34.194
What are you doing here?

30:34.297 --> 30:38.290
I had to come back into town
to clear some things up.

30:38.401 --> 30:41.165
Your father. I'm so sorry.

30:42.471 --> 30:43.369
Thanks.

30:43.472 --> 30:44.564
Tom, where did you go?

30:44.674 --> 30:46.733
It's been...

30:46.842 --> 30:47.866
ten years.

30:49.979 --> 30:52.140
You look even prettier than when I left.

30:52.248 --> 30:53.340
Left?

30:53.449 --> 30:56.782
You say that like you just went off
to school or something.

30:58.187 --> 31:00.121
You just vanished.

31:00.222 --> 31:01.712
Your dad didn't even
know where you were.

31:01.824 --> 31:04.554
We all started to think
that you were dead.

31:09.632 --> 31:11.327
I'm sorry.

31:17.106 --> 31:19.074
That's a beautiful family you have there.

31:22.878 --> 31:25.005
I guess it's not
Sarah Mercer anymore.

31:25.114 --> 31:26.081
No.

31:27.283 --> 31:28.511
It's Sarah Palmer now.

31:28.617 --> 31:31.347
I never thought Axel would settle down.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.513
But he always did like you.

31:35.591 --> 31:36.956
I should go.

31:37.059 --> 31:38.185
Wait.

31:38.294 --> 31:40.819
It's good to see you, Sarah.

31:55.277 --> 31:56.539
Mommy!

31:56.645 --> 31:58.237
Hey, Sheriff. How was your day?

31:58.347 --> 31:59.974
Good. It was real good.

32:00.082 --> 32:01.743
Good. Why don't
you go upstairs and brush your teeth,

32:01.851 --> 32:03.284
and I'll be up in a sec for story time,

32:03.386 --> 32:04.683
and you can tell me all about it, okay?

32:04.787 --> 32:06.379
- Okay, Mom.
- Love you.

32:06.489 --> 32:07.478
Bye.

32:08.824 --> 32:10.917
- Hey, Rosa, is Axel home yet?
- No, Mrs. Palmer.

32:11.027 --> 32:12.187
All right. Thanks for everything today.

32:12.294 --> 32:14.319
I can take it from here.

32:37.520 --> 32:38.748
<i>Hello.</i>

32:38.854 --> 32:40.981
- Hey, it's me.
<i>- Axel, are you okay?</i>

32:41.090 --> 32:43.183
<i>I heard that somebody died</i>
<i>at the motel last night.</i>

32:43.292 --> 32:44.725
Look, I don't have time to talk now,

32:44.827 --> 32:46.556
but I just thought
you should know it was...

32:46.662 --> 32:47.788
it was Irene.

32:47.897 --> 32:49.091
She was murdered.

32:49.198 --> 32:51.063
<i>Irene?</i>

32:51.167 --> 32:54.466
<i>Hey, Sheriff, you want</i>
<i>to come look at these tapes?</i>

32:54.570 --> 32:57.095
I got to go.

33:12.755 --> 33:14.916
Oh, yeah.

33:15.024 --> 33:17.993
This certainly won't quiet the rumors
about Harry Warden being back.

33:18.094 --> 33:19.220
People can think what they want.

33:19.328 --> 33:20.625
Doesn't make it true.

33:20.729 --> 33:22.253
The talk is out there, Sheriff.

33:22.364 --> 33:24.525
A lot of folks remember ten years ago
like it was yesterday.

33:24.633 --> 33:27.659
Yeah, and there's a lot of miner suits
in this town, Martin.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.601
It's not Harry Warden.
He's dead, remember?

33:29.705 --> 33:32.731
Sheriff, you got a Valentine.

33:41.183 --> 33:43.014
Ferris, get me a glove.

34:00.636 --> 34:02.160
Oh, Jesus.

34:05.374 --> 34:06.341
Not Harry?

34:09.612 --> 34:12.103
Harry Warden is dead.

34:12.214 --> 34:13.909
I shot him myself.

34:15.417 --> 34:17.715
It's a copycat. Just some sick fuck.

34:17.820 --> 34:20.014
He wasn't buried in no cave-in.

34:20.121 --> 34:23.216
They never did find his body,
despite what the reports say.

34:23.324 --> 34:25.384
Aw, hell.

34:25.494 --> 34:26.984
The Hanniger kid.

34:27.096 --> 34:28.893
What the hell is he doing here?

34:28.998 --> 34:30.090
Leave the kid alone.

34:30.199 --> 34:32.632
- Relax, Hinch...
- You cocksucker!

34:33.768 --> 34:34.667
Hinch!

34:34.770 --> 34:36.931
Get... Back up! Get the hell off!

34:37.039 --> 34:38.529
What the fuck?

34:38.641 --> 34:39.938
He's back because of you.

34:40.042 --> 34:41.668
You were responsible.

34:41.777 --> 34:43.608
He wants you!

34:43.712 --> 34:44.679
Easy.

34:46.114 --> 34:47.706
You're in the wrong bar, kid.

34:47.815 --> 34:49.340
Get off of me.

34:49.451 --> 34:50.543
Red!

34:56.926 --> 35:01.090
Everybody, stand down,
God damn it!

35:01.197 --> 35:03.722
Harry's gonna kill you
for good this time. You hear me?

35:03.832 --> 35:05.129
Hanniger, hit the door. Come on...

35:05.234 --> 35:06.792
Why?

35:06.902 --> 35:08.199
'Cause you people want to blame me

35:08.304 --> 35:10.499
for the shit that happened a decade ago?

35:10.606 --> 35:12.631
I didn't kill those people!

35:12.741 --> 35:15.039
Come on. Come on!

35:15.144 --> 35:17.806
It started with you, Tom.

35:17.913 --> 35:20.848
Half the people here know someone
who died because of your fu...

35:20.950 --> 35:24.010
Harry Warden
killed them, not me.

35:24.119 --> 35:25.643
I know that, but you...

35:25.754 --> 35:27.745
Then why don't they blame you?

35:27.856 --> 35:29.221
I mean, you were the sheriff.

35:29.325 --> 35:30.383
Yeah.

35:32.294 --> 35:34.285
I just saved your ass, Hanniger.

35:34.396 --> 35:36.296
For the second time.

35:36.398 --> 35:38.025
But don't you worry, kiddo.

35:39.668 --> 35:40.760
There won't be a third.

35:40.869 --> 35:41.836
Good.

35:57.820 --> 35:59.253
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

35:59.355 --> 36:01.755
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

36:09.531 --> 36:11.362
What's wrong? Is it Noah?

36:11.467 --> 36:13.958
Noah's fine, but it's 2 in the morning.

36:14.069 --> 36:15.127
What is that?

36:17.006 --> 36:18.132
It's an evidence tape.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.367
Irene's murder.

36:23.946 --> 36:25.345
I'm sorry.

36:25.447 --> 36:26.505
I'll let you get back...

36:26.615 --> 36:28.879
Tom Hanniger's back in town
to sell the mine.

36:30.286 --> 36:32.948
He didn't stop by and visit you, did he?

36:33.055 --> 36:35.990
Yeah, he came to
the grocery store today.

36:36.091 --> 36:37.558
I was definitely surprised.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.127
Why? What's going on?

36:39.228 --> 36:40.889
The love of your life might be involved

36:40.996 --> 36:43.692
in some very deep shit.

36:45.901 --> 36:48.495
He's not the love of my life.

36:48.604 --> 36:49.901
No?

36:54.109 --> 36:56.270
You left this on the dresser.

37:03.752 --> 37:06.220
It was the last time
you and him were together.

37:07.589 --> 37:09.250
Always brings a tear to my eye.

37:09.358 --> 37:10.484
Axel, I don't want to fight.

37:10.592 --> 37:12.685
It's... I gotta be at work in five hours.

37:12.795 --> 37:14.763
Yeah, well, I have to work now.

37:17.499 --> 37:20.730
I found this tape at the murder scene.

37:34.183 --> 37:38.142
If Tom contacts you again,
you let me know right away.

37:53.135 --> 37:54.397
Oh, God!

37:54.503 --> 37:55.561
- Easy.
- Jesus.

37:55.671 --> 37:57.400
It's just me.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.372
A little jumpy these days.

37:59.475 --> 38:01.136
I'm sorry.

38:01.243 --> 38:02.540
What are you doing here?

38:02.644 --> 38:06.080
I wanted to, uh, talk to you
when you weren't working.

38:06.181 --> 38:09.514
Well, I'm at work.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.680
Well, you got 15 minutes
before the store opens.

38:18.594 --> 38:20.425
I shouldn't have left the way that I did.

38:20.529 --> 38:23.464
I know I fucked up.

38:23.565 --> 38:25.590
It was a long time ago.

38:27.369 --> 38:29.030
You know, the second I saw you,

38:29.138 --> 38:32.369
I instantly regretted
the last ten years of my life?

38:32.474 --> 38:34.874
You sell those mines,
you'll regret the rest of your life, too.

38:34.977 --> 38:36.638
I didn't come here
to talk to you about that.

38:36.745 --> 38:39.612
You have no idea, do you?

38:39.715 --> 38:41.342
This town depends on that mine.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.247
Everyone here,
everyone from the miners

38:43.352 --> 38:44.876
to the cashiers at the grocery store.

38:44.987 --> 38:46.420
That's not my responsibility.

38:46.522 --> 38:47.614
Yes, it is.

38:47.723 --> 38:49.088
You ran away ten years ago,

38:49.191 --> 38:51.682
but the rest of us stayed
to pick up the pieces.

38:51.794 --> 38:53.785
We supported each other.

38:55.264 --> 38:56.595
Don't you remember
how much that mine

38:56.698 --> 38:58.256
used to mean to your family?

38:58.367 --> 39:00.392
I guess not.

39:00.502 --> 39:02.470
Because you just ran away,
and you just keep on running.

39:02.571 --> 39:04.368
It didn't follow you for ten years.

39:06.575 --> 39:07.633
It didn't?

39:09.311 --> 39:11.677
- I faced it.
- I can't.

39:13.115 --> 39:15.948
I wish I could, but I can't.

39:16.051 --> 39:18.281
I lost my way.

39:20.022 --> 39:22.650
Tom, you can go back to that place

39:22.758 --> 39:25.192
where it all went wrong
and find your way again.

39:25.294 --> 39:28.695
Or you can just keep running
the rest of your life.

39:28.797 --> 39:30.958
It's your choice.

40:19.047 --> 40:20.207
What do you got?

40:20.315 --> 40:22.112
I need a signature.

40:25.220 --> 40:26.687
Get this in.

40:26.788 --> 40:28.722
Tom? What the hell you doing here?

40:28.824 --> 40:30.553
Where's Ben? I need to talk to him.

40:30.659 --> 40:31.853
You can't. He's down in the mine.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.520
- I'm going down.
- Like hell you are.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.757
- It's not safe.
- I grew up in these mines, Riggs.

40:36.865 --> 40:37.797
I think I'll be fine.

40:49.244 --> 40:51.712
Who's bleeding the lines on 3?

40:53.982 --> 40:55.313
Red'll take you down.

41:13.302 --> 41:15.236
How's the hand?

41:32.154 --> 41:34.486
Just don't touch anything.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.490
I'll call for Ben.

41:39.294 --> 41:41.922
Yeah. Hey, send Ben to tunnel 3.

41:42.030 --> 41:44.055
He's got a visitor.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.058
What the hell do you mean?

41:49.938 --> 41:52.771
Well, go and get him, then.

41:52.874 --> 41:54.865
Stupid ass.

42:01.149 --> 42:03.845
<i>We'll rescue Trainor down below.</i>

42:03.952 --> 42:05.749
<i>You, venom, and methane in 5, all right?</i>

42:05.854 --> 42:07.014
<i>I know my job, Harry.</i>

42:07.122 --> 42:08.350
<i>Like fuck you do.</i>

42:08.457 --> 42:09.583
<i>I know my job, Harry.</i>

42:09.691 --> 42:11.386
<i>Like fuck you do.</i>

43:17.893 --> 43:19.087
Well, you know what?

43:19.194 --> 43:21.219
You couldn't find
your ass with both hands.

43:21.329 --> 43:22.591
Listen.

43:24.099 --> 43:25.157
Well...

43:26.835 --> 43:28.427
What do you want?

43:34.409 --> 43:36.309
Son of a bitch!

43:40.148 --> 43:41.672
Guys, trouble on 3.

43:41.783 --> 43:43.910
Red's into it again. Come on, let's go!

43:44.019 --> 43:45.680
Double time!

44:07.776 --> 44:09.437
You're dead, motherfucker.

45:17.913 --> 45:18.845
Red!

45:18.947 --> 45:19.936
Red!

45:22.884 --> 45:24.283
Red?

45:26.655 --> 45:28.555
Jesus Christ.

45:28.657 --> 45:30.557
What you got?

45:30.659 --> 45:33.150
Oh, fuck.

45:33.261 --> 45:34.159
Is he dead?

45:35.597 --> 45:37.827
Riggs! Is he dead?

45:37.933 --> 45:39.457
Get me out of here.

45:39.568 --> 45:42.002
- What happened?
- Get me out of here.

45:42.103 --> 45:43.570
Come on.

45:45.173 --> 45:47.038
It's jammed. Give me a hand.

45:47.142 --> 45:48.905
- Got it.
- Get it open.

45:49.010 --> 45:51.501
Get me the fuck out of here.

45:52.547 --> 45:54.879
What'd you do, Tom?
What did you do?

45:54.983 --> 45:56.541
I didn't do anything!

45:59.421 --> 46:00.388
Shit.

46:02.724 --> 46:04.885
Happy Valentine's Day.

46:07.929 --> 46:09.863
That's quite the public service, Sarah.

46:09.965 --> 46:11.796
Never one to break tradition, Dr. Miller.

46:11.900 --> 46:13.800
Let me just steal one.

46:13.902 --> 46:14.994
I won't tell if you won't.

46:15.103 --> 46:16.070
Thank you.

46:22.344 --> 46:24.073
Where the hell were you?

46:24.179 --> 46:25.544
I was in tunnel 3.

46:25.647 --> 46:26.579
We found Red.

46:26.681 --> 46:28.740
It was Harry Warden.

46:28.850 --> 46:30.511
Tommy, come on.

46:30.619 --> 46:32.109
He attacked me,

46:32.220 --> 46:34.484
and then I sat there,
and I watched him kill Red.

46:34.589 --> 46:36.079
You know how crazy that sounds?

46:36.191 --> 46:37.522
It's fucking nuts, okay?

46:37.626 --> 46:38.650
I know that.

46:38.760 --> 46:40.523
But he was there,
and he tried to kill me.

46:40.629 --> 46:42.392
Sir, please, relax.

46:42.497 --> 46:46.126
Okay. You can get
your shirt back on now.

46:46.234 --> 46:47.201
Thank you.

46:51.773 --> 46:54.367
Tommy, exactly what did you see?

46:54.476 --> 46:55.841
What happened to you?

46:57.045 --> 46:58.171
He was attacked.

46:58.280 --> 46:59.577
By who?

46:59.681 --> 47:01.740
Nobody.

47:01.850 --> 47:03.613
Harry Warden.

47:03.718 --> 47:05.709
It happened in the mine.

47:08.723 --> 47:09.917
What were you doing in the mine?

47:10.025 --> 47:13.119
I was gonna tell Ben
that I'm not selling it.

47:16.197 --> 47:17.289
And why the hell not?

47:20.468 --> 47:22.766
You find something in town
that's suddenly worth staying for?

47:22.871 --> 47:26.329
Axel, you were always jealous
of me and Sarah.

47:27.642 --> 47:29.269
You mean my wife Sarah?

47:29.377 --> 47:30.810
Who lives in my house?

47:30.912 --> 47:32.937
Who is mother to my son?

47:33.048 --> 47:35.243
Who I share a bed with
and have sex with?

47:35.350 --> 47:36.817
- Axel, enough!
- That Sarah?

47:36.918 --> 47:38.317
Enough.

47:40.655 --> 47:43.453
- Harry Warden, right? He attacked you.
- Yeah.

47:43.558 --> 47:47.050
Besides the fact that he's been dead
for ten years,

47:47.162 --> 47:49.653
how comes no one else saw him?

47:49.764 --> 47:51.493
I don't know, Sheriff, but I was there.

47:51.599 --> 47:52.861
I saw him.

47:52.968 --> 47:56.369
You know, this town's
in a frenzy because of you.

47:56.471 --> 47:59.702
I'm gonna put an end to that right now.

47:59.808 --> 48:01.969
You want to tell them, or should I?

48:04.546 --> 48:06.275
What the hell are you talkin' about?

48:06.381 --> 48:07.643
Fine. I'll tell 'em, then.

48:07.749 --> 48:10.741
You see, Tom, my dad,
who drank himself to death,

48:10.852 --> 48:13.116
along with your dad and Ben here,

48:13.221 --> 48:15.985
decided to take the law
into their own hands ten years ago.

48:16.091 --> 48:17.718
They killed Harry Warden.

48:17.826 --> 48:19.157
Axel.

48:19.260 --> 48:20.818
And Sheriff Burke covered it up.

48:23.431 --> 48:26.662
We couldn't have the town fathers
on the hook for vigilante justice.

48:26.768 --> 48:29.259
You see, Harry wasn't
buried alive in the mine,

48:29.371 --> 48:31.703
but he's sure as shit dead and buried.

48:31.806 --> 48:33.239
And we're gonna lay that to rest.

48:34.409 --> 48:35.376
Aren't we?

48:43.818 --> 48:45.149
Where is it?

48:45.253 --> 48:46.982
I don't know what you think
you're gonna find.

48:47.088 --> 48:49.113
Jim, just show me
where the body's buried,

48:49.224 --> 48:50.213
and we won't have any problems.

48:50.325 --> 48:53.488
Once we find the old escape hatch,
it's just beyond there.

48:53.595 --> 48:55.460
Sheriff, you really think that dangling

48:55.563 --> 48:58.896
a set of decade-old bones
in town square

48:59.000 --> 49:00.558
is gonna clear up these murders?

49:00.668 --> 49:04.229
No, but it'll stop people from thinking
the boogey man is back.

49:04.339 --> 49:07.035
And then I can get on
with my investigation.

49:09.878 --> 49:11.004
Found the hatch.

49:12.380 --> 49:14.814
Yeah. This is where we found him.

49:14.916 --> 49:16.781
Bleeding at the hatch.

49:16.885 --> 49:18.750
Over here.

49:26.861 --> 49:28.692
I found it.

49:30.465 --> 49:31.625
Or what used to be it.

49:33.868 --> 49:34.926
What the hell is this?

49:36.237 --> 49:38.000
Animals must have got at him.

49:38.106 --> 49:40.404
Animals? Was he dead or not
when you buried him?

49:40.508 --> 49:41.998
Damn right he was dead.

49:42.110 --> 49:43.668
There was no pulse.

49:43.778 --> 49:45.678
There was no life
left in him at all, right?

49:45.780 --> 49:48.271
I shot him. I shot
the son of a bitch dead.

49:48.383 --> 49:49.907
Yeah, we buried him right here.

49:50.018 --> 49:52.578
It was a better burial than he deserved.

49:52.687 --> 49:55.155
And you're sure he was dead, Ben?

49:56.724 --> 49:58.589
There's no way he could be alive.

49:58.693 --> 50:00.957
God damn it.

50:02.330 --> 50:04.662
I want statements from the both of you.

50:04.766 --> 50:07.735
And you, I want you back
at the station now.

50:07.836 --> 50:10.100
We got a dead miner to discuss.

50:10.205 --> 50:11.137
Come on, Sarah.

50:11.239 --> 50:12.900
Come on, gentlemen.

50:21.850 --> 50:23.374
What were you doing at the mine earlier?

50:24.686 --> 50:26.119
I was doing my job.

50:29.090 --> 50:32.321
You're the suspect. Not me.

50:39.400 --> 50:41.698
I didn't kill the guy
in the mine, okay?

50:41.803 --> 50:43.862
I know somebody wants you
to think that I did,

50:43.972 --> 50:45.530
but I didn't.

50:45.640 --> 50:47.540
Relax.

50:47.642 --> 50:49.234
We'll get to that.

50:55.316 --> 50:56.408
So.

50:57.685 --> 50:59.243
Why are you really back in town?

51:01.356 --> 51:02.516
You know why.

51:02.624 --> 51:05.184
No.

51:05.293 --> 51:08.660
I don't know why someone would miss
their own father's funeral,

51:08.763 --> 51:10.993
but show up to sell off his only asset.

51:11.099 --> 51:13.624
Well, I'm not selling the mine.

51:13.735 --> 51:15.464
In fact, I've decided to stay.

51:20.642 --> 51:22.507
And why is that?

51:28.149 --> 51:30.344
You know she settled for you.

51:30.451 --> 51:31.816
Right?

51:37.892 --> 51:39.189
My God.

51:40.628 --> 51:42.391
What did you just say to me?

51:42.497 --> 51:44.931
Sarah settled for...

51:47.869 --> 51:49.166
Stay the fuck away from my wife!

51:49.270 --> 51:50.168
You hear me?

51:50.271 --> 51:51.431
Stay the fuck away from my wife!

51:51.539 --> 51:52.801
Axel! Axel, calm down.

51:52.907 --> 51:54.067
Lock him up, Martin! Lock him up!

51:54.175 --> 51:55.301
I can't do that!

51:55.410 --> 51:58.379
The mine foreman confirmed
that Tom was stuck

51:58.479 --> 52:01.277
in that cage when they came down.

52:01.382 --> 52:03.441
Somebody else was down there.

52:08.223 --> 52:10.157
That's great.

52:10.258 --> 52:11.987
That's fucking wonderful.

52:12.093 --> 52:13.958
Fuck!

52:21.903 --> 52:24.133
Won't be long before Axel
locks you up for good.

52:24.239 --> 52:25.866
Just because Axel
wants to think that I did it

52:25.974 --> 52:27.236
doesn't mean that I did.

52:27.342 --> 52:28.832
There was someone else down there.

52:28.943 --> 52:31.810
Yeah. Harry.

52:31.913 --> 52:35.007
- But how? Why?
- I don't know, Ben.

52:35.116 --> 52:37.812
Maybe to finish
what he started ten years ago.

52:37.919 --> 52:39.887
If I were you, Tom,
I'd get the hell out of town.

52:39.988 --> 52:42.479
No. No, I'm not running this time.

52:42.590 --> 52:44.251
I'm gonna find him.

52:46.494 --> 52:50.157
If you don't find him,
I'm betting he finds you.

52:51.432 --> 52:52.797
Or you.

56:08.196 --> 56:09.288
Who is it?

56:51.639 --> 56:53.539
Damn Harry Warden.

56:54.876 --> 56:57.845
Got me aiming at shadows.

57:00.214 --> 57:02.682
Aiming at shadows.

57:24.872 --> 57:25.839
Harry.

57:30.044 --> 57:31.773
It is you.

57:32.980 --> 57:34.845
No. No.

57:34.949 --> 57:36.473
l... l...

57:52.066 --> 57:53.931
No. No.

57:54.035 --> 57:55.696
No. No.

58:00.074 --> 58:01.974
No. No.

58:02.076 --> 58:03.043
No.

58:08.416 --> 58:10.111
Shit.

58:15.156 --> 58:17.215
I know the picture's ten years old,

58:17.325 --> 58:18.690
but that's all that we have.

58:18.793 --> 58:20.920
Yeah, I know every store
in the state are selling the candy boxes,

58:21.028 --> 58:22.495
but send Harry Warden's photo anyway.

58:22.597 --> 58:24.064
Who knows? We might get lucky.

58:24.165 --> 58:25.530
How many favors have I done for you?

58:25.633 --> 58:27.066
- Yes.
- Just make this happen.

58:27.168 --> 58:28.294
So what's the problem?

58:28.402 --> 58:29.630
No, no, don't...
don't put me on hold.

58:29.737 --> 58:30.965
This is unbelievable.

58:31.072 --> 58:32.835
Yeah. Well, then, tell him to do it.

58:32.940 --> 58:35.500
I don't care who does it.
Just get it done.

58:35.610 --> 58:36.577
All right.

58:37.645 --> 58:40.512
Yes. All right. Good.

58:41.916 --> 58:42.883
Sarah.

58:46.754 --> 58:48.483
Thought I'd bring you some lunch.

58:48.589 --> 58:49.647
Have you seen Tom?

58:49.757 --> 58:51.554
No. Not since yesterday.

58:51.659 --> 58:53.684
Well, we lost track of him this morning,
and Ben's missing.

58:53.794 --> 58:54.692
I don't know where he is.

58:54.795 --> 58:56.285
Look, this isn't a game, Sarah.

58:56.397 --> 58:58.126
People are dead,
and Tom is the only one without an alibi.

58:58.232 --> 58:59.290
Tom said somebody else was in...

58:59.400 --> 59:01.834
- The fuck there was!
- Jesus.

59:05.973 --> 59:07.406
What is with you two?

59:10.177 --> 59:12.008
Look. I'm sorry, okay?

59:12.113 --> 59:13.842
- I'm sorry.
- Sheriff.

59:14.882 --> 59:15.849
What is it?

59:18.319 --> 59:19.411
We found Ben.

59:24.625 --> 59:25.887
I'll see you later.

59:42.743 --> 59:44.176
What do you think?

59:46.480 --> 59:48.448
We're being mocked.

59:50.584 --> 59:52.108
Only three other people
out here earlier.

59:52.219 --> 59:54.119
I'm pretty sure my wife's not the killer.

59:55.656 --> 59:58.386
Get a cruiser outside my house.

59:58.492 --> 01:00:00.255
Find Burke.

01:00:00.361 --> 01:00:02.625
Find Tom Hanniger.
They're our prime suspects.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.111
Megan, honey, you can let that go.

01:00:21.215 --> 01:00:22.375
Can you give me a hand, please?

01:00:22.483 --> 01:00:24.314
Axel wants us to get out of here quick.

01:00:24.418 --> 01:00:26.079
You're the boss.

01:00:28.489 --> 01:00:31.117
Okay. Thank you.

01:00:35.262 --> 01:00:38.254
How did you ever end up with Axel
if you were with Tom?

01:00:38.365 --> 01:00:41.926
Uh, it was Valentine's Day,
you know, when, um...

01:00:42.036 --> 01:00:44.231
When Harry Warden killed everyone?

01:00:44.338 --> 01:00:46.203
You were there.

01:00:47.641 --> 01:00:49.199
Was Tom?

01:00:51.178 --> 01:00:52.145
Yeah.

01:00:54.115 --> 01:00:58.609
But Axel was the one
that was there for me.

01:00:58.719 --> 01:01:02.450
But... he's not anymore.

01:01:08.796 --> 01:01:11.060
Did you lock up the front?

01:01:11.165 --> 01:01:12.359
Yes.

01:01:12.466 --> 01:01:14.764
Hello. The store's closed.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.634
Hello?

01:01:52.139 --> 01:01:53.037
Wait here.

01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.164
Wait!

01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:59.873
I'm kind of a pussy sometimes.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:01.447
Welcome to the club.

01:02:28.075 --> 01:02:29.565
There's nobody here, Sarah.

01:02:43.691 --> 01:02:44.953
Shit!

01:02:45.059 --> 01:02:46.686
God! Megan.

01:02:46.794 --> 01:02:48.921
Okay, let's go. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

01:02:53.634 --> 01:02:54.794
Shit!

01:02:54.902 --> 01:02:56.733
Go! Go!

01:03:15.189 --> 01:03:16.952
No. Fuck.

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:30.268
Come on, Megan!

01:03:35.843 --> 01:03:37.174
Sarah!

01:03:37.278 --> 01:03:39.940
Go, go, go, go!

01:03:42.283 --> 01:03:43.773
The back room!

01:03:45.452 --> 01:03:46.646
What the fuck?

01:03:47.755 --> 01:03:49.518
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:03:50.791 --> 01:03:51.723
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:03:51.825 --> 01:03:53.087
Help me, help me, help me!

01:03:53.193 --> 01:03:54.387
Come on! Come on!

01:03:56.931 --> 01:03:58.523
Come help me. Quick, quick!

01:03:58.632 --> 01:03:59.621
Come on! Push it now!

01:04:00.668 --> 01:04:03.501
The window! Go! Go, go, go! Go!

01:04:09.977 --> 01:04:12.275
Oh, shit! It's locked!

01:04:12.379 --> 01:04:14.643
Sarah, we need the key!

01:04:14.748 --> 01:04:16.147
The key's in the desk. Hurry!

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.615
The key's in the desk. Hurry!

01:04:17.718 --> 01:04:19.811
- Come on! Hurry!
- Stop yelling at me!

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:24.652
Fuck.

01:04:24.758 --> 01:04:26.123
It's at Mercer's grocery store!

01:04:26.226 --> 01:04:28.319
It's Harry Warden, and he's inside!

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:30.795
I got it! I got it!

01:04:43.143 --> 01:04:45.577
I can't get it!

01:04:47.481 --> 01:04:48.971
I can't get it.

01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:50.050
Got it!

01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.387
I got it.

01:04:57.591 --> 01:04:58.751
Go, go!

01:04:58.859 --> 01:05:00.622
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:07.756
Hurry. Oh, you can...
Turn, turn, turn.

01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:10.063
Come on, hurry. Wait. Something's not right.

01:05:10.170 --> 01:05:11.933
Something's not right.
Something's... Come back.

01:05:12.039 --> 01:05:13.267
Come back. Come back.
Come back.

01:05:13.374 --> 01:05:14.341
Oh, shit!

01:05:14.441 --> 01:05:16.375
Oh, my God! Sarah!

01:05:16.477 --> 01:05:18.104
Sarah, help me!

01:05:18.212 --> 01:05:20.612
Help me, Sarah!

01:06:13.267 --> 01:06:14.291
I got you.

01:06:14.401 --> 01:06:15.629
I got you. I got you. I got you!

01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:17.829
Sarah! Where is he?

01:06:17.938 --> 01:06:18.962
What about Megan, huh?

01:06:19.073 --> 01:06:20.665
Back alley. She's in the back alley.

01:06:20.774 --> 01:06:22.264
Okay.

01:06:22.376 --> 01:06:23.274
Stay behind me.

01:06:23.377 --> 01:06:24.639
Sarah. Sarah!

01:06:24.745 --> 01:06:26.576
Stay behind me. You understand?

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:27.738
Yes, yes. Yes.

01:07:17.131 --> 01:07:18.120
Stay back, baby.

01:07:24.071 --> 01:07:25.504
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

01:07:25.606 --> 01:07:27.972
Sarah, stay back.
You don't want to see this.

01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:33.936
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:55.863
They're gonna take you
over to the hospital

01:07:55.969 --> 01:07:57.266
and have you checked out.

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.200
Why would he go after her?

01:08:03.777 --> 01:08:06.177
Everybody's connected to the mine.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:08.009
Just like ten years ago.

01:08:08.115 --> 01:08:09.082
Megan wasn't.

01:08:12.786 --> 01:08:14.447
Maybe the killer was
just trying to get to you.

01:08:14.555 --> 01:08:16.420
What are you talking about?

01:08:18.625 --> 01:08:20.149
I'm not blind, Axel.

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:27.624
Let's go.

01:09:11.178 --> 01:09:13.078
Noah, I'm just taking the garbage out.

01:09:25.759 --> 01:09:27.453
Is your cartoon over already?

01:09:59.393 --> 01:10:01.418
He's here, inside the house.

01:10:05.365 --> 01:10:06.923
Come on.

01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.712
You want to take point?

01:10:30.691 --> 01:10:32.522
I'm retired.

01:11:09.930 --> 01:11:11.761
<i>... the highest building in the city.</i>

01:11:11.865 --> 01:11:13.355
<i>Mr. Murray realized</i>
<i>that there were no more</i>

01:11:13.467 --> 01:11:16.834
<i>miserable people left, except for him.</i>

01:11:16.937 --> 01:11:19.599
<i>At which point, Mr. Murray</i>
<i>shot himself in the foot.</i>

01:11:31.651 --> 01:11:32.618
Noah.

01:11:50.036 --> 01:11:51.162
I want you to duck down.

01:11:51.271 --> 01:11:52.795
Stay hidden, okay?

01:11:52.906 --> 01:11:56.603
Don't come out until
I come and get you, no matter what.

01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:50.955
Burke! Get in here now!

01:13:29.102 --> 01:13:30.262
Hello.

01:13:30.370 --> 01:13:32.600
<i>Sarah, it's me. Where are you?</i>

01:13:34.274 --> 01:13:35.241
I'm at the hospital.

01:13:35.342 --> 01:13:36.775
What happened? Are you okay?

01:13:36.877 --> 01:13:38.276
You were right.

01:13:40.213 --> 01:13:41.271
Harry Warden's back.

01:13:41.381 --> 01:13:43.508
<i>He tried to kill me. I got away.</i>

01:13:43.617 --> 01:13:44.948
Did you see his face?

01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:46.780
Just the mask.

01:13:46.887 --> 01:13:48.411
Sarah, I don't think it's Harry.

01:13:48.522 --> 01:13:50.490
What are you saying?

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:51.887
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

01:13:51.992 --> 01:13:52.924
Tom...

01:13:53.026 --> 01:13:54.584
Do you trust me?

01:13:55.962 --> 01:13:57.862
Yeah.

01:13:57.964 --> 01:13:58.953
I trust you.

01:13:59.065 --> 01:14:00.396
Okay, good.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:01.398
There's something I have to show you.

01:14:01.501 --> 01:14:02.900
Tom, I have to get back to Noah.

01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:04.300
That's fine. I'll take you to him.

01:14:04.404 --> 01:14:05.928
But I gotta show you
something along the way.

01:14:12.546 --> 01:14:14.309
Where can I find Sarah?

01:14:14.414 --> 01:14:16.143
Well, Sheriff, she just checked out.

01:14:16.249 --> 01:14:17.580
What are you talking about?

01:14:18.652 --> 01:14:19.846
About ten minutes ago.

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:22.786
She left with that nice Tom Hanniger.

01:14:22.889 --> 01:14:24.584
<i>Sheriff.</i>

01:14:26.793 --> 01:14:27.885
Go ahead.

01:14:27.994 --> 01:14:30.087
<i>I just got that report in</i>
<i>on Tom Hanniger.</i>

01:14:30.196 --> 01:14:32.130
<i>You're gonna want to hear this.</i>

01:14:40.073 --> 01:14:42.337
It took me ten years to get
that mask out of my head,

01:14:42.442 --> 01:14:43.807
and just like that, it's back.

01:14:45.779 --> 01:14:47.713
You know Axel owns land up here?

01:14:47.814 --> 01:14:49.281
Yeah. It's his daddy's old place.

01:14:49.382 --> 01:14:50.747
Been there lately?

01:14:55.121 --> 01:14:56.520
Axel's not who you think he is, Sarah.

01:14:56.623 --> 01:14:58.284
What are you saying?

01:14:58.391 --> 01:15:00.859
I'm saying I think he's responsible
for what's going on.

01:15:02.362 --> 01:15:03.329
The murders.

01:15:04.764 --> 01:15:05.731
That's crazy.

01:15:09.035 --> 01:15:10.525
Don't answer that.

01:15:14.708 --> 01:15:16.039
Hello?

01:15:16.142 --> 01:15:18.770
Where are you?

01:15:18.878 --> 01:15:20.971
He's with you, isn't he?

01:15:23.984 --> 01:15:24.882
Yes.

01:15:24.985 --> 01:15:25.952
Who is that?

01:15:26.052 --> 01:15:28.213
All right, Sarah, listen to me.

01:15:28.321 --> 01:15:30.050
You need to get away
from Tom now.

01:15:30.156 --> 01:15:31.714
I'm not sure if
I know what you mean.

01:15:31.825 --> 01:15:34.692
Tom has been in a mental institute
for the past seven years.

01:15:34.794 --> 01:15:36.125
<i>He is not the guy you grew up with.</i>

01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:37.287
Who is it?

01:15:37.397 --> 01:15:39.865
<i>He was in our house, Sarah. Rosa is dead.</i>

01:15:39.966 --> 01:15:41.058
<i>So is Burke.</i>

01:15:41.167 --> 01:15:42.725
He went after our son.

01:15:43.970 --> 01:15:45.096
<i>And now he has you.</i>

01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:49.003
- Noah. Is he...
<i>- Noah's fine. Noah's fine.</i>

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:51.942
He's with Ferris at the station. He's safe.

01:15:52.045 --> 01:15:53.069
Look.

01:15:54.881 --> 01:15:57.076
I know I've been horrible to you.

01:15:57.183 --> 01:15:59.151
And I'm sorry. Okay?

01:15:59.252 --> 01:16:00.412
You can leave me if you want,

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:03.683
but just get out of the car, please.

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:05.189
Sarah, get out of the car.

01:16:07.027 --> 01:16:09.257
Thanks for checking in on him, Mom.

01:16:24.344 --> 01:16:27.472
I need to get home. My mom said
that Noah's not feeling very well.

01:16:28.948 --> 01:16:30.347
That wasn't your mom.

01:16:30.450 --> 01:16:32.782
I need to get home to my son.

01:16:32.886 --> 01:16:34.114
Don't you trust me?

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.482
Take me home.

01:16:35.588 --> 01:16:37.749
- Damn it, Sarah! I need you to understand.
- Oh, God!

01:16:37.857 --> 01:16:39.688
Okay? I need somebody to understand.

01:16:39.793 --> 01:16:41.988
Tom. Tom, you're starting to scare me.

01:16:42.095 --> 01:16:43.392
You're the only one that I can trust.

01:16:43.496 --> 01:16:45.020
Okay? You gotta go with me on this.

01:16:45.131 --> 01:16:47.497
I have a husband and a son.
Please, just take me home.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:51.036
Axel wants you to think that it's me,
but it's not. Okay?

01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:53.162
I don't think you know
what he's capable of.

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.065
I'm not gonna let you
take that chance, okay?

01:16:56.176 --> 01:16:58.303
I'm not gonna let you do that again.

01:16:58.411 --> 01:16:59.400
Fuck!

01:17:09.222 --> 01:17:11.213
Sarah!

01:18:53.092 --> 01:18:54.150
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.990
Axel? I crashed the car
in the woods by the mine.

01:18:57.096 --> 01:18:58.120
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:18:58.231 --> 01:19:00.426
- Yeah. I think so.
<i>- Oh, God.</i>

01:19:00.533 --> 01:19:03.593
Okay. You go to my dad's old place,

01:19:03.703 --> 01:19:04.829
<i>- all right?</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:05.836
<i>You hide.</i>

01:19:05.939 --> 01:19:07.497
I'm on my way.

01:19:07.607 --> 01:19:08.574
All right.

01:19:36.202 --> 01:19:37.362
Shit.

01:19:58.591 --> 01:19:59.580
Okay.

01:20:38.197 --> 01:20:40.893
<i>Axel wants you</i>
<i>to think that it's me, but it's not, okay?</i>

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.900
<i>I don't think you know what he's capable of.</i>

01:21:18.471 --> 01:21:19.495
Axel.

01:21:30.283 --> 01:21:31.545
Fuck! Fuck!

01:23:09.749 --> 01:23:11.046
Oh, God.

01:23:12.618 --> 01:23:13.585
Fuck!

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:03.930
Oh, shit.

01:24:04.036 --> 01:24:05.060
Oh, fuck.

01:24:06.205 --> 01:24:07.194
Fuck.

01:24:27.393 --> 01:24:28.382
- Jesus.
- Don't move, Axel.

01:24:28.494 --> 01:24:30.553
Sarah, what are you doing?

01:24:30.663 --> 01:24:32.631
I found your hearts.

01:24:34.167 --> 01:24:35.191
Hearts? What are you saying?

01:24:35.301 --> 01:24:36.199
Up in the house.

01:24:36.302 --> 01:24:37.326
Your fucking Valentine's hearts.

01:24:37.436 --> 01:24:39.028
The Valentine from Megan?

01:24:39.138 --> 01:24:42.164
Look, I'm sorry. All right?

01:24:42.275 --> 01:24:44.334
- It meant <i>nothing...</i>
- I'm not talking about fucking Megan!

01:24:44.443 --> 01:24:45.774
The hearts, Axel.

01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:49.314
The 300 fucking candy boxes
you used to put the hearts in!

01:24:50.816 --> 01:24:54.081
It's Tom, Sarah. Tom must have...

01:24:54.187 --> 01:24:55.711
Stop it! It's your house, Axel.

01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:57.914
The picture of me and Tom,
you took it. It was there.

01:24:58.024 --> 01:24:59.252
Tom must have put it there.

01:24:59.358 --> 01:25:01.383
Sarah, I've been working
the past 72 hours.

01:25:01.494 --> 01:25:03.587
When would I have time to play psycho?

01:25:03.696 --> 01:25:04.822
You're the sheriff, Axel.

01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:09.163
I mean, you come
and go as you please.

01:25:09.268 --> 01:25:10.633
All right, Tom, stay back.

01:25:10.736 --> 01:25:13.170
It's okay, Sarah.

01:25:13.272 --> 01:25:15.240
- All right...
- The both of you, stop fucking moving!

01:25:17.610 --> 01:25:19.202
Sarah, look at me.

01:25:19.312 --> 01:25:21.746
Shoot him, and he won't move.

01:25:21.847 --> 01:25:25.146
What? Axel, we're gonna get you help.

01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:27.446
You are so full of shit!

01:25:27.553 --> 01:25:29.453
Sarah, stop it. You don't fucking
believe this guy?

01:25:29.555 --> 01:25:31.182
Axel, I know you hate me,
and I don't really give a shit,

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:33.281
but this is your wife. Stop lying to her!

01:25:33.392 --> 01:25:35.883
Shut up! He's crazy!
He was in an institution.

01:25:35.995 --> 01:25:38.759
Oh, that's real nice. Nice try.

01:25:45.738 --> 01:25:47.603
Fuck it. Just shoot us both.

01:25:49.242 --> 01:25:51.005
- What?
- What?

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:52.941
Yeah, just shoot us both.

01:25:53.045 --> 01:25:54.672
Do it. Come on, it's your only choice.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:57.180
If you just shoot me, Sarah,
you'd still be down here with a killer.

01:25:57.283 --> 01:25:59.478
What are you talking about?
Sarah, don't listen to him.

01:25:59.585 --> 01:26:00.847
- Sarah, do it.
- He needs help, Sarah.

01:26:00.953 --> 01:26:03.285
Do it. You have to do it,
Sarah. Shoot us!

01:26:03.389 --> 01:26:04.947
- Nobody's shooting anyone, Axel.
- Shoot us!

01:26:05.057 --> 01:26:06.422
- Sarah, listen to me!
- Will you stop it?

01:26:06.525 --> 01:26:08.117
No, listen to me!
The words that Megan wrote

01:26:08.227 --> 01:26:10.127
in her Valentine, "Be mine forever"?

01:26:10.229 --> 01:26:12.493
Those are the same words
written in blood above her dead body.

01:26:12.598 --> 01:26:13.656
Isn't that right, Axel?

01:26:13.766 --> 01:26:15.324
I'm gonna rip your fucking head off.

01:26:18.404 --> 01:26:20.167
How did you know
that Megan was dead?

01:26:22.975 --> 01:26:24.237
You told me.

01:26:29.048 --> 01:26:30.675
No, I didn't.

01:26:35.655 --> 01:26:38.988
And how'd you know about
the words written on the wall?

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:46.356
Sarah...

01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:53.333
What is that?

01:26:56.676 --> 01:26:59.509
It's him. It's Harry.

01:27:00.946 --> 01:27:02.538
It's fucking him. It's...

01:27:02.648 --> 01:27:05.446
It's Harry, Sarah.
Sarah, you gotta shoot him.

01:27:05.551 --> 01:27:06.677
Sarah, he's right there. Shoot him.

01:27:08.054 --> 01:27:10.249
It's Harry, Sarah.
You gotta shoot him.

01:27:10.356 --> 01:27:11.914
It's Harry.
There he is. He's right there.

01:27:12.024 --> 01:27:14.993
Shoot him! What are you doing?
Shoot him. He's right there!

01:27:15.094 --> 01:27:16.083
Sarah, shoot him! He's right there!

01:27:16.195 --> 01:27:17.253
Tom, there's nobody else here!

01:27:17.363 --> 01:27:19.763
He's right there! Shoot him!

01:27:19.865 --> 01:27:21.560
Sarah, you gotta shoot him!
Shoot him now! Shoot him!

01:27:21.667 --> 01:27:23.498
Sarah, he's right there! Shoot him!

01:27:23.602 --> 01:27:26.435
He's right there! Shoot him now!

01:27:26.539 --> 01:27:29.235
Sarah, shoot him!
Shoot him, shoot him.

01:27:29.342 --> 01:27:31.105
Sarah, what are you doing?
Shoot him now. He's right here.

01:27:35.014 --> 01:27:37.073
He's right here.

01:27:37.183 --> 01:27:38.673
He's right... He's right...

01:27:42.154 --> 01:27:43.485
He's right here. He's right here.

01:27:43.589 --> 01:27:44.578
He's right here. He's right here.

01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:45.918
He's right here.

01:29:03.702 --> 01:29:05.761
Harry's not here, Tom.

01:29:05.871 --> 01:29:07.065
No.

01:29:08.574 --> 01:29:09.541
He's here.

01:29:11.410 --> 01:29:12.570
Aren't you, Harry?

01:29:14.914 --> 01:29:15.881
You living inside Tom?

01:29:19.752 --> 01:29:21.219
Oh, I'm right here.

01:29:25.224 --> 01:29:26.486
I fucking knew it.

01:29:26.592 --> 01:29:27.616
Axel.

01:30:54.346 --> 01:30:56.439
Oh, God.

01:30:59.885 --> 01:31:02.752
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:31:02.855 --> 01:31:04.015
Come on.

01:31:04.123 --> 01:31:05.181
Let's go. Come on.

01:31:06.292 --> 01:31:07.725
Let's go.

01:31:09.395 --> 01:31:11.090
Come on. I want to go home.

01:31:11.196 --> 01:31:12.993
I want to go home.

01:31:52.171 --> 01:31:54.196
- Okay.
- We can't miss.

01:31:54.306 --> 01:31:56.365
There's one bullet left.

01:31:59.311 --> 01:32:00.278
Don't miss.

01:32:12.091 --> 01:32:13.251
Tom.

01:33:13.085 --> 01:33:14.916
Hey, come here.
You better check this out.

01:33:26.598 --> 01:33:28.566
Hang in there, buddy.
Help's on the way, okay?

01:33:33.939 --> 01:33:36.737
Hey! Help's coming, okay?

01:33:36.842 --> 01:33:38.810
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:33:38.911 --> 01:33:40.310
Can you tell me your n...

01:33:51.757 --> 01:33:52.689
Right this way.

01:33:56.261 --> 01:33:57.751
Yeah, yeah.

01:34:07.906 --> 01:34:11.137
- Sarah. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:11.243 --> 01:34:12.471
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:34:18.617 --> 01:34:21.279
Hey, Sheriff. Sheriff, look at me.

01:34:22.321 --> 01:34:24.255
Look at me, Sheriff.

01:34:24.356 --> 01:34:25.618
Where's Hanniger?

01:34:30.496 --> 01:34:31.690
Tom's dead.

01:34:40.305 --> 01:34:42.466
I love you.

01:34:42.574 --> 01:34:44.542
I love you, too.
