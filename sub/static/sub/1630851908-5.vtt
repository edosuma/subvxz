00:07.967 --> 00:10.177
...meet up with
her at CrossFit to fuck.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.679
[Haley]: I think
you're a snake.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.639
[Haley]: And I don't trust
anything you say.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.141
[Haley]: Nah, fuck them.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.684
[Haley]:
She's a big ass fucking liar!

00:16.726 --> 00:18.853
[Haley]: So is fucking
Jordan!

00:18.894 --> 00:20.938
Hey, I'm sorry that both of
you just had to see that.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.982
I'm sorry that both
of you had to witness that.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.316
That was so ridiculous.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.568
- I don't know
what's going on.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.486
- I want everybody
to get along.

Our moms were having
the time of their lives.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.366
They were making
friends with everybody,

00:32.408 --> 00:34.994
and shit hit the fan.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.871
[Haley]: I will! I fucking will.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.167
- Is that what's
going on now, bitch?

00:41.167 --> 00:43.419
The accusations are that

00:43.461 --> 00:45.588
Murphy has been
inappropriate to Summer.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.923
She has sent her a message

00:47.965 --> 00:51.177
about meeting up
somewhere and fucking around.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.556
And my take on it all was
that Summer wanted to get it off

00:55.598 --> 00:59.185
her chest
and talk to Haley about it.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.978
If it were
the other way around, Summer,

01:01.020 --> 01:03.230
she would have
wanted someone to tell her

01:03.272 --> 01:06.066
about the accusations that were
being said about her girlfriend.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.693
Me personally,
I've never seen Brianna

01:07.735 --> 01:09.320
do that to you or seen
her do that to anybody.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.821
- I pop off really quick towards

01:10.863 --> 01:12.198
them and nobody knows why.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.074
It's because, Murphy,

01:14.116 --> 01:15.701
she makes me uncomfortable,
she's so inappropriate, and

01:15.743 --> 01:17.203
she's been
getting away with it for

01:17.244 --> 01:18.871
a very long time
because nobody speaks out.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.206
- Does that with everybody.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.665
- I'm willing to
speak the fuck up.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.251
You come at them,
I have a problem.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.878
I'm not at all surprised that

01:25.920 --> 01:27.505
Summer popped off to Haley.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.174
And to get it correct,

01:30.216 --> 01:34.220
Haley popped off to Summer
first and Summer retaliated.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.638
[Summer]: Will you come
talk to me really quick?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.556
[Haley]: Sure.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.933
I think you're a snake

01:38.974 --> 01:39.934

trust anything you say.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.061
I feel really bad for you.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.271
Summer is not
somebody to back down

01:44.313 --> 01:46.565
from an argument
or back down from a fight.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.526
She's proud of that, and I
would be too if I were her.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.944
If I thought that you guys

01:49.985 --> 01:51.487

going to squash it,

01:51.529 --> 01:52.905

getting fucking

is going fucking South.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.910

- Really fucking fast.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.537
It's about to get worse.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.706
Summer pulled Haley aside and
kind of wanted to like end

02:02.748 --> 02:06.043
it all and tell her what
the fuck is bothering her,

02:06.085 --> 02:09.463
and that shit
didn't go as planned.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.132
And now we're fighting again,

02:12.174 --> 02:14.677
so this shit sucks again.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.679
- Fucking infidelity
disgusts me.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.722
I will not associate
myself with Murphy ever again.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.057
Therefore, by association

02:20.057 --> 02:21.183
with her being her girlfriend,

02:21.225 --> 02:23.227
Haley is done, too. Dead to me.

we're too old for that.

If you think that's out of line,

know what to tell you.

stories about you too,

try to come for me.

throw that in my face

03:04.518 --> 03:06.145

me off. So I'm over it.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.314
The way that me
and Mel became friends is

03:08.355 --> 03:10.608
she had a lot of
drama with a lot of people.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.943
In my opinion,
none at her fault.

03:12.985 --> 03:16.947
People were ganging up and
bulling her pretty much,

03:16.989 --> 03:19.116

her and about her character,

03:19.158 --> 03:22.494

She doesn't want anymore drama.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.580
Nice.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.915
- You have to wet them.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.875
You can do that if you want.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.670
So that was bullshit
last night.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.297
This isn't like
the first time in

08:25.339 --> 08:26.548
the last six
years that people have

08:26.590 --> 08:28.008
been trying to break us up.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.259
- So...
- I know.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.303
Last night, Summer comes up to

08:31.345 --> 08:33.222
me and she's like
Brianna invited her CrossFit

08:33.263 --> 08:35.515
to fuck so
I know that bitch was lying

08:35.557 --> 08:38.727
and she was lying straight
to my face and honestly,

08:38.769 --> 08:40.646
she just looks like an idiot
because Brianna literally did

08:40.687 --> 08:42.064
- CrossFit a year ago and...
- Literally.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.774
...we've known her
for three years,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.276
so I'm not really sure
what her intentions were.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.737
Everybody's got
some crazy ulterior motive.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.447
- I honestly went into it with

08:50.489 --> 08:52.157
like good intentions
and I thought that we were

08:52.199 --> 08:54.284
going to like squash
whatever the issue was

08:54.326 --> 08:56.119
because I honestly thought
that there was nothing even

08:56.161 --> 08:58.205
between us that happened
that was that serious.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.207
- Obviously, there's
something underlying, you know?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.584
I mean, as for Summer,
Marissa, and Jordan,

09:02.626 --> 09:05.212
you know, this type of thing
eventually was to come.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.547
They're always fucking
scheming some shit.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.549
They're used to
their partner controlling them

09:09.591 --> 09:11.385
and I feel
like that's just not us.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.970
Because honestly
the only time I want

09:13.011 --> 09:13.971
a controlling
relationship is in the bed.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.806
- [laughing]
- So...

09:15.847 --> 09:17.349
A lot of people don't have
the connection that we have

09:17.391 --> 09:20.519
to be comfortable going
out and having a good time

09:20.560 --> 09:22.771
and not be like
holding onto each other

09:22.813 --> 09:25.565
- like fucking so desperately.
- Yeah.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.359
Like them, for example,
they're literally like

09:27.401 --> 09:29.069
hiding in the corner,
clung at the hip.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.153
Not socializing.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.613
- That's their business though.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.864
Honestly, that's their
own business.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.616
I hope they find
their own happiness.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.493
I hope they don't have to run
around trying to start shit,

09:36.576 --> 09:38.078
and Jordan's the same way,

09:38.120 --> 09:39.371
like she's never been
in a happy relationship.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.455
She's literally
cheated on almost

09:40.497 --> 09:41.957
every girl that she's dated.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.793
And as for the whole like
open relationship thing...

09:44.835 --> 09:46.253
...them saying that
is actually a joke.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.963
None of their shit
makes any sense.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.464
They say that we're
in an open relationship

09:49.506 --> 09:51.049
and I'm cheating on you.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.718
I feel like it's kind of weird

09:52.759 --> 09:55.554
the relationship between
Summer, Marissa, and Cuppie.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.014
But what's even weirder is

09:57.055 --> 09:58.682
the relationship between Summer,

09:58.724 --> 10:00.100
Marissa, and Jordan.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.686
Those three are
a little too close.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.896
And Jordan has hooked
up with Marissa too more

10:04.938 --> 10:06.940
recently from what
I heard through the grapevine.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.859
Cuppie ain't the only one.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.944
It's funny how we spoke to
Cuppie and Nellie and shit

10:10.986 --> 10:12.654
and nobody ever heard
Summer's elaborate story.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.989
- I know.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.240
Nobody's ever
heard that story before,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.742
all of a sudden
it came out of the blue.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.201
Why wouldn't
she tell her best friends?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.536
She came there with
the whole plan, Haley.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.537
- Exactly.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.372
You know, as long as
you're happy, I'm happy.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.790
I mean if I was
them I would be

10:23.832 --> 10:26.168
jealous of us
and our relationship too.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.586

- So...

10:54.529 --> 10:56.406

I think it kind of like built up

and then I had other shit
piling up too and then

11:25.644 --> 11:28.313
I kind of got just like got hit
with it all at once.

Mommy is going to get

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031

been pretty well under control.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.995

that all this fighting going on

11:44.037 --> 11:46.248
has been kind of like
sparking up some new shit

11:46.289 --> 11:47.833
because it's hard like
being in the middle.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.709
I'm like super close with Summer

caution. You know what I mean?

Because she's straight.

ever been with a woman.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.248
Going good.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.999
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.042
- We're here.
- What's happening?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.169
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.963
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.507
- Hi, how are you?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.883
- Didn't bring the moms tonight?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.301
- No, my mom's gone.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.720
- Hi!
- We're just hanging out.

16:51.761 --> 16:56.015
- This is our wet menu
that we have now.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.435
- Are your mom's like, upset?
'Cause I'm so embarrassed.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.395
- I just think for
our moms to be there

17:00.437 --> 17:02.647
to have a night out
to get to know everyone,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.941
it turned into
a fucking brawl. Quick.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.235
- I had anxiety
and I know these people

17:07.277 --> 17:09.571
I can't imagine
not knowing people.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.365
- I mean, she understands
English and she understood

17:12.407 --> 17:13.825
enough to know that someone

17:13.867 --> 17:15.702
said someone was
cheating on someone.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.162
She was like, "If
a bitch told me

17:17.203 --> 17:19.205
that my husband
was cheating on me,

17:19.247 --> 17:20.623
then I would
have done the same thing."

17:20.665 --> 17:22.459
- Haley came up to me
and she was like,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.127
"So, you believe everything

17:24.169 --> 17:26.880
that Summer's saying?"
And I was like, "What?"

17:26.921 --> 17:29.591
And she asked me again
and I was like, "Listen,

17:29.632 --> 17:31.968
the only reason
that I walked out is because

17:32.010 --> 17:34.179
you threw a drink and it was
getting too much for me."

17:34.220 --> 17:37.390
So then Haley made
a comment saying like, "Oh,

17:37.432 --> 17:39.476
if throwing
a drink is too much, like

17:39.517 --> 17:40.894
I've heard about
all the stuff that

17:40.935 --> 17:42.270
you've done."
Or something like that.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.980
- It was kind of
like a mouse being

17:44.022 --> 17:45.732
like backed into a corner
by a snake.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.734
Oh my God,
I'm not calling her snake.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.903
I felt she was literally
doing anything that she could

17:49.944 --> 17:53.281
just to like change
the subject and everyone's name,

17:53.323 --> 17:54.908
got like, you got thrown out
over it,

17:54.949 --> 17:55.909
Jordan got
thrown out over it,

17:55.950 --> 17:57.577
my name got thrown out over it,

17:57.619 --> 17:59.746
and I was having this anxiety
about the whole thing.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.539
Well, years ago,
like back in 2012,

18:01.581 --> 18:02.749
I was in an abusive
relationship so when

18:02.791 --> 18:04.626
I saw like Murphy like lunge

18:04.667 --> 18:05.960
at Summer and Marissa
last night,

18:06.002 --> 18:07.629
- it like...
- Triggers you.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.838
- Gives me anxiety.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.590
- As soon as
it got aggressive,

18:10.632 --> 18:12.175
that's why I left.
I was like, I can't handle this.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.468
I emotionally
and mentally can't handle it.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.388
The drama
between the two couples

18:17.430 --> 18:19.766
really created
a negative environment.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.018
Everyone got brought
into their problems.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.353
[Summer]: Bitch, you in denial.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.271
Your bitch slimy,
your bitch slimy.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.898

18:26.940 --> 18:28.566

That you're a fucking whore.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.028

I fucking will.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.447

out now, bitch?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.573
[Haley]: If you think that's out
of line, then

18:35.615 --> 18:37.283
I don't know what to tell you.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.660
[Haley]: I've heard a lot of
stories about you too,

18:38.701 --> 18:40.161
so don't
even try to come for me.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.205
Jordan shouldn't
have been dragged into it.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.957

have been dragged into it.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.667

18:45.708 --> 18:48.253
I don't really
understand when people do that.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.505
It's not really
fair to other people.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.257
It was uncalled for,
it was unnecessary,

18:52.298 --> 18:53.842
but at this point,

18:53.883 --> 18:56.052
there's not a relationship,
just move on.

understand why all of a sudden

20:17.634 --> 20:20.511
now it's crumbling down

20:20.553 --> 20:23.097
because I feel like I never
had anxiety before

20:23.139 --> 20:24.682
and then a few months
ago I started having

20:24.724 --> 20:27.226

25:22.605 --> 25:24.190
At the beginning of your
relationship.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.900
This stuff's been
giving me so much anxiety,

25:25.942 --> 25:28.152
so I'm not quite sure
if going to a shooting range

25:28.194 --> 25:30.571
and having those conversations
is going to be a good idea.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.823
But talking around alcohol

25:32.865 --> 25:35.034
seems to not be
working for any of us.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.035
- Everybody have
eyes and ears?

25:36.077 --> 25:37.620
[all]: Yes.

25:37.662 --> 25:38.746
Okay, we're going
to be safe today.

25:38.788 --> 25:39.914
We're going to have some fun.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.374
If you follow me up the stairs,

25:41.415 --> 25:43.167
we're going to
start the training and

25:43.209 --> 25:45.753
then hopefully
hit some clay pigeons.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.923
So my loyalty definitely
goes to Brianna and Haley.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.883
Yeah, I heard
the whole conversation.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.052
- When Brianna shoves me
out of her way in the bathroom,

25:53.094 --> 25:54.512
that wasn't really cool.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.389
But I mean, I know that emotions
were high

25:56.430 --> 25:58.099
and she was like really pissed
off, so I mean that's okay.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.767
I'm not going to stop
being friends with her over

25:59.809 --> 26:01.560
one night of high emotions.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.354
- We're going to
hold the gun correctly

26:03.396 --> 26:06.274
and have you fire at
some stationary targets

26:06.315 --> 26:07.566
on the ground, then
we'll go

26:07.608 --> 26:09.277
and get in some
targets in the air.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.112
I love skeet shooting,
I feel like it's so fun.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.655
It's a good way
to blow off steam.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.156
A lot of people are against it,

26:14.198 --> 26:15.992
but I feel like
it's important to be able

26:16.033 --> 26:17.994
to have an idea on
how to handle firearms

26:18.035 --> 26:19.662
so you're not scared of them
and it's definitely

26:19.704 --> 26:21.998
popular in Florida or
anywhere really in the South.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.458
[Summer]: And hopefully...
no drama.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.627
- You want to hold on to
stuff and dwell, that's on you.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.838
If you want to have fun and
be part of what we're doing,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.131
that's probably the best choice.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.261
- Okay, we're going to
go live fire.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.388
Awesome.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.556
- I hate it.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.598
- There's another one in there.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.436
- Are you all right?

26:43.477 --> 26:44.729
You got it.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.356
Your turn, Cuppie.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.899
- I've shot like handguns
before,

26:48.941 --> 26:52.028
but I've never
shot like this big thing before

26:52.069 --> 26:54.864
and I've seen all these videos
of girls holding it

26:54.905 --> 26:56.615
and shooting and like
getting knocked the fuck out.

26:57.825 --> 26:58.909
- Put the safety off.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.328
- I don't want to do it.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.621
- This is...
- [Olivia]: You got it.

27:02.663 --> 27:03.622
- Are you okay?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.458
- Yeah. I just...

27:05.499 --> 27:07.501
- I don't want to...
- No, it's okay.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.003
...traumatize you...

27:09.045 --> 27:10.713
[Haley]: Just shoot.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.131
- Ah! I don't like it at all.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.134
- You don't like it.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.635
- All right, it was fine.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.554
- All right, pull.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.390
- Nice job. Awesome.
- Ah! Good job.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.267
- Got the safety on?

27:24.393 --> 27:26.187
Not bad.

27:26.228 --> 27:29.273
Merge.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.858
There you go,
right in the heart.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.112
Stay nice with it.
Good shot.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.198
- Ooh, feel like I'm hunting.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.240
- Safety on.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.408
- Did you hit it?
- Yeah.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.077
- She wouldn't look.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.453
She was looking away,
she's like did you hit it?

27:42.495 --> 27:43.454
- No, I don't want to
get hit with

27:43.496 --> 27:45.039
a thingy coming at my face.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.499
- Look at the bottom left.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.625
- All right!

27:47.666 --> 27:50.628
[cheering]

27:50.669 --> 27:53.255
♪♪

28:06.560 --> 28:09.355
- All right, make them safe,
put the guns away.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.109
- Wow, that was fun.
- That's hot.

28:13.150 --> 28:17.988
I really wanted to talk
to Haley about the huge fight.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.824
My biggest thing
that I've been trying to

28:19.865 --> 28:22.701
work on is if
something's bothering me,

28:22.743 --> 28:24.787
is not holding it in
and like bottling it up

28:24.829 --> 28:25.996
because then it fucking
builds up

28:26.038 --> 28:27.706
and builds up and builds up,

28:27.748 --> 28:32.086
so I'm really trying to
focus on speaking my feelings.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.046
- Brianna, you want to
help me pick up the shells.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.256
- Oh, yeah, you know
I love cleaning up.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.507
Clean up the mess.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.925
- Pay someone to clean up.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.469
- Um, so...
- Hi.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.764
I want to talk to you.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.808
- Yeah.
- You like threw out
my name at Tangra

28:45.850 --> 28:47.184
- Mhm.
- and that was like upsetting

28:47.226 --> 28:48.769
because
I didn't expect that of you.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.896
So like that bothered me.
I don't ever say anything.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.773
I understand that you were
in a weird situation,

28:52.815 --> 28:53.774
- Yeah.
- but like I just don't want it

28:53.816 --> 28:54.942
to keep happening.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.528
- I shouldn't have
thrown your name out there.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.612
I am sorry.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.407
Obviously,
the Tangra thing like that was

29:01.449 --> 29:04.243
like a heated situation.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.619
- A shit show.
- Yeah.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.288
It was just like
going downhill real fast.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.914
I get that.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.666
Obviously, I've always
been cool with you,

29:10.708 --> 29:11.584
and I've never had a problem
with you

29:11.625 --> 29:13.085
and I shouldn't have
thrown your name out there.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.128
I was just
feeling hurt and attacked.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.671
- No, I totally get it.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.006
- And so I was just trying to
think of something

29:17.047 --> 29:18.632
that I knew would... You know?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.468
- That's what
I told myself to justify

29:20.509 --> 29:21.886
the situation cause I was like

29:21.927 --> 29:23.596
I mean, she was in a bad
spot and I get it.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.849
Me telling Summer
that Cuppie and Marissa

29:26.891 --> 29:28.559
had a little
fling on the side

29:28.601 --> 29:30.728
or something while
they were dating.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.271
I said that in
the heat of a moment

29:32.313 --> 29:33.772
just to get under Summer's skin.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.524
I just felt like
everyone was throwing shade

29:35.566 --> 29:37.568
like being like, "No drama" and
I was like,

29:37.610 --> 29:39.487
listen, I'm not
trying to have any drama.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.489
I'm just literally just
trying to talk and communicate.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.698
- I understand that.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.408
- So... I think we were all so
drunk so it was like...

29:44.450 --> 29:46.285
- I think it's hard because
I feel like we always

29:46.327 --> 29:48.078
try to have our conversations
after we've been drinking.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.747
I mean, I knew I wanted to talk
to you about this thing.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.248
I wasn't trying to have it
at the beginning

29:51.290 --> 29:52.625
and us like have
like a weird day.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.418
It doesn't need to be weird.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.379
- No, no. Not with us. I feel
like that's different situation.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.964
- I love that for us.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.425
- Okay. Well,
I'm glad we were able to talk

30:01.467 --> 30:03.928
after holding guns all day.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.766
If I've learned anything
from going to therapy it's

30:08.807 --> 30:11.477
talk out your shit,
set up boundaries.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.729
It was absolutely
not okay for my name

30:13.771 --> 30:16.273
to just get thrown out
because your feelings got hurt.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.275
So I think that having
this conversation's

30:18.317 --> 30:20.027
really going to
clear the air for everybody,

30:20.069 --> 30:21.487
so I don't have
drama with Summer and Marissa

30:21.529 --> 30:23.822
or with Haley and Brianna.

30:23.864 --> 30:24.907
- Onward.
- Fuck.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.786

crooked anyway, so it's fine.

Reide and I thought it'd be

30:50.057 --> 30:52.351
a good idea to have
it be a group hang

30:52.393 --> 30:53.602
so it won't be like too
much pressure,

30:53.644 --> 30:55.104

going to be a good time.

31:03.153 --> 31:05.030
Remember Reide
from the softball game?

31:05.072 --> 31:06.490
The tall one?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.659
Yeah. So I invited
her here to hang out.

with her because like,

31:15.332 --> 31:17.001
- she's never been with a girl.
- [Amanda]: Oh, one of those.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.753
- But she's like telling me
she likes me.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.714
But like, I just like can't...

31:21.755 --> 31:22.840
- Is it a girl that's like...

31:22.881 --> 31:24.550
...is she curious
and she might be

31:24.592 --> 31:25.759
- bisexual but she doesn't know?

31:28.637 --> 31:30.306
I got the biggest gaydar,
I got you.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.266
The gaydar is a real thing, and

31:32.308 --> 31:34.852
every gay person has a gaydar.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.771
If you're a baby gay
and you're not even out yet,

31:37.813 --> 31:39.898
you still have
the gaydar because

31:39.940 --> 31:42.234
you kinda know
as a closeted gay,

31:42.276 --> 31:45.529
what other closeted gays
are going to act like or say.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.114
Well, definitely have to say,

32:06.300 --> 32:07.801
I high key have abs.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.136
- No, low, low, low.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.971
- That's not...

to do me like that?

ridiculous too, I love it.

Reide is giving me
so many compliments,

32:27.321 --> 32:28.989

she's always given me

32:29.031 --> 32:31.200
compliments like,
she's always texting me,

32:31.241 --> 32:33.077

talk about reducing

32:41.710 --> 32:43.003
my carbon footprint right now.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.089
- Okay.
- You know what I'm saying?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.590
I got different
things on my mind.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.841
- Like?

32:47.883 --> 32:50.302
That spot on your shirt.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.349
- So, wait, I have a serious
question though, like...

32:56.350 --> 32:58.394
...you're not like gay,

32:58.435 --> 32:59.937
you're not like bi.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.730
You're just like...

33:01.772 --> 33:03.232
You're straight?

33:03.273 --> 33:05.025
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.486
Period.

33:07.528 --> 33:08.570
Ha, period.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.782
- Well, that's good to know.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.409
- Why do you ask?

33:13.450 --> 33:17.121
- But then your text are like,
some of them are like...

33:17.162 --> 33:19.248
It's a little confusing,
for sure.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.252
I apologize.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.632
- Like, do you have a boyfriend?
- Mhm.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.219
How long has
that been happening?

33:36.390 --> 33:38.350
Just like an estimate.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.643
- Like one year.

33:41.395 --> 33:42.896
- A year?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.523
Through my text
messages with Reide,

33:44.565 --> 33:47.568
she kind of hinted
that she might have had

33:47.609 --> 33:49.445
like something going on
with someone

33:49.486 --> 33:52.448
and I kind of knew like,
she has to have a guy

33:52.489 --> 33:54.616
in the picture, like obviously
it's not another girl

33:54.658 --> 33:56.493
when she's telling me
she's never been interested

33:56.535 --> 33:58.203
in a girl before me.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.081
So I'm like, what the fuck
is going on right now?

34:01.123 --> 34:02.166
- What happened?

34:03.459 --> 34:04.918
- Oh, what happened?

34:04.960 --> 34:08.797
So, um, she has a boyfriend
and I'm over it.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.674
She just told me they've been
together for a year.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.259
I'm like, really?
Because two weeks ago

34:12.301 --> 34:14.386
you didn't say you had
a boyfriend when you were

34:14.428 --> 34:16.221
sending me those
fucking little...

34:16.263 --> 34:19.183
- No, I've read the text
messages, that's not fair.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.769
- It's not fair. And you
know what she said?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.604
She said,
"Sorry, I confused you."

34:25.063 --> 34:26.106
- Okay.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.319
- I just asked her,
"Are you straight?"

34:30.360 --> 34:31.779
And she said, "Yeah."
And I'm like,

34:31.820 --> 34:33.572
"Your text messages
are really confusing."

34:33.614 --> 34:35.115
She's like "I'm sorry
you feel that way."

34:35.157 --> 34:37.409
Some shit like that.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.578
That's like,
a little infuriating.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.247
- Oh. Infuriating?
I've no idea know what to say.

34:42.289 --> 34:46.460
I'll keep it cool but like...
It's like fucked up.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.837
To me, there is a spectrum.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.465
On one end there's straight
and on one end there's gay

34:51.507 --> 34:52.841
but like, I truly feel
like everybody

34:52.883 --> 34:54.426
is somewhere in the middle.

34:54.468 --> 34:57.137
In this situation,
if Reide is bi-curious,

34:57.179 --> 35:00.057
or if she's really
just not sure, that's okay.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.725
Like there's nothing
wrong with that.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.436
There are women that have
been married for 10 years

35:04.478 --> 35:06.188
and download TikTok

35:06.230 --> 35:07.397
and all of a sudden figure out
that they like girls.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.524
It is what it is.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.359
But at the same time,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.444
if you want to explore that,

35:12.486 --> 35:14.488
then you need to
end your relationship.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.449
- She told me she has
a fucking boyfriend, of a year.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.326
- Oh hell no.

35:20.577 --> 35:23.497
Oh, hell no.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.957
Wait then what's the text
about?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.416
- I don't know.
- What's the text about?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.377
I want to be like,
"What's your intentions,

35:28.418 --> 35:30.504
because if you have a boyfriend
then like what are you doing?"

35:30.546 --> 35:31.421
- No, please don't say that.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.340
I don't want to be
like confrontational at all.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.341
It's cool.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.218
- I don't like that.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.762
Shiva is always unclear on
what the fuck is happening.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.389
And i this Reide
girl has a boyfriend,

35:40.430 --> 35:42.307
you need to be
loyal to your boyfriend,

35:42.349 --> 35:44.726
but don't text one of my best
friends about your feelings.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.228

you're playing both of them.

says something

Different question?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.377
Why's she looking
at me like that?

36:10.419 --> 36:11.837
- I don't know what's happening.

36:11.879 --> 36:13.797

guys been together?

- I don't know what's
going on over here, but...

36:16.967 --> 36:17.968

and her boyfriend

36:18.010 --> 36:19.136
have been together.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.220
And she looked at me crazy.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.555
- I literally tell Olivia,

36:21.597 --> 36:23.307
don't say anything to Reide.

Literally, 17 seconds later,

she tells Reide
"I know you have a boyfriend"

36:27.269 --> 36:28.228
or at least some
shit like that,

36:28.270 --> 36:30.022
that pisses Reide off.

care about them.

Everybody knows that.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.891
But I think that too

42:38.765 --> 42:40.850
But, if I was told by
my best friend

42:40.892 --> 42:43.395
that something similar was
going on and she said,

42:43.436 --> 42:44.688
are you still going
to hang out with them,

42:44.729 --> 42:45.814
the first thing I would say is,

42:45.855 --> 42:47.649
how would it make you feel

42:47.691 --> 42:49.567
and are you okay
with it if I do?

42:49.609 --> 42:52.821
If somebody was fucking
doing the same shit to you all,

42:52.862 --> 42:54.489
this wouldn't be
a fucking conversation.

42:54.531 --> 42:56.241
If Ali came up to me and said,

42:56.283 --> 42:59.119
"This person has
grabbed my girlfriend,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.538
multiple times she's
grabbed fucking Nelly,"

43:01.579 --> 43:03.957
would I fucking
say hey, hey, hey?

43:03.999 --> 43:06.293
I mean, come on, are we
being fucking real now?

43:06.334 --> 43:08.503
What upset me is
that she was asking me

43:08.545 --> 43:11.214
things that I felt
should go unsaid.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.466
As a friend,
I love Nelly and Ali,

43:13.508 --> 43:15.385
and I think that them asking me
if that would bother me,

43:15.427 --> 43:16.720
hurt my feelings.

43:16.761 --> 43:17.929
We're good friends,
you should know

43:17.971 --> 43:19.347
that that would
hurt my feelings.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.349
We care about you
and it's like,

43:21.391 --> 43:23.893
"Is it one-sided?" Like...

43:23.935 --> 43:26.021
I know how I would move in
this situation

43:26.062 --> 43:27.981
and I'll watch how
other people move.

43:28.023 --> 43:31.568
We've never had
tension like that with them.

43:31.609 --> 43:35.238
And I felt like we let them down

43:35.280 --> 43:37.824
even though I don't think
that we did anything wrong.

43:37.866 --> 43:39.242
- In that moment, I was
kind of distraught.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.869
Like, what the fuck?

43:42.495 --> 43:43.580
I'm ready to go.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.582
- I just, I guess...
- I need to go.

43:45.623 --> 43:46.624
Yeah.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.627
