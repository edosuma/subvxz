WEBVTT

00:06.340 --> 00:07.925
[Summer]: Murphy asked me to...

00:07.967 --> 00:10.177
...meet up with
her at CrossFit to fuck.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.679
[Haley]: I think
you're a snake.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.639
[Haley]: And I don't trust
anything you say.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.141
[Haley]: Nah, fuck them.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.684
[Haley]:
She's a big ass fucking liar!

00:16.726 --> 00:18.853
[Haley]: So is fucking
Jordan!

00:18.894 --> 00:20.938
Hey, I'm sorry that both of
you just had to see that.

00:20.980 --> 00:22.982
I'm sorry that both
of you had to witness that.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.316
That was so ridiculous.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.568
- I don't know
what's going on.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.486
- I want everybody
to get along.

00:27.528 --> 00:30.489
Our moms were having
the time of their lives.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.366
They were making
friends with everybody,

00:32.408 --> 00:34.994
and shit hit the fan.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.871
[Haley]: I will! I fucking will.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.167
- Is that what's
going on now, bitch?

00:41.167 --> 00:43.419
The accusations are that

00:43.461 --> 00:45.588
Murphy has been
inappropriate to Summer.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.923
She has sent her a message

00:47.965 --> 00:51.177
about meeting up
somewhere and fucking around.

00:51.218 --> 00:55.556
And my take on it all was
that Summer wanted to get it off

00:55.598 --> 00:59.185
her chest
and talk to Haley about it.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.978
If it were
the other way around, Summer,

01:01.020 --> 01:03.230
she would have
wanted someone to tell her

01:03.272 --> 01:06.066
about the accusations that were
being said about her girlfriend.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.693
Me personally,
I've never seen Brianna

01:07.735 --> 01:09.320
do that to you or seen
her do that to anybody.

01:09.361 --> 01:10.821
- I pop off really quick towards

01:10.863 --> 01:12.198
them and nobody knows why.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.074
It's because, Murphy,

01:14.116 --> 01:15.701
she makes me uncomfortable,
she's so inappropriate, and

01:15.743 --> 01:17.203
she's been
getting away with it for

01:17.244 --> 01:18.871
a very long time
because nobody speaks out.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.206
- Does that with everybody.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.665
- I'm willing to
speak the fuck up.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.251
You come at them,
I have a problem.

01:24.293 --> 01:25.878
I'm not at all surprised that

01:25.920 --> 01:27.505
Summer popped off to Haley.

01:27.546 --> 01:30.174
And to get it correct,

01:30.216 --> 01:34.220
Haley popped off to Summer
first and Summer retaliated.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.638
[Summer]: Will you come
talk to me really quick?

01:35.679 --> 01:37.556
[Haley]: Sure.

01:37.598 --> 01:38.933
I think you're a snake

01:38.974 --> 01:39.934
and I don't
trust anything you say.

01:39.975 --> 01:42.061
I feel really bad for you.

01:42.102 --> 01:44.271
Summer is not
somebody to back down

01:44.313 --> 01:46.565
from an argument
or back down from a fight.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.526
She's proud of that, and I
would be too if I were her.

01:48.567 --> 01:49.944
If I thought that you guys

01:49.985 --> 01:51.487
were actually
going to squash it,

01:51.529 --> 01:52.905
and to see that everyone's
getting fucking

01:52.947 --> 01:55.074
riled up and starting to scream,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.492
I was like this shit
is going fucking South.

01:56.534 --> 01:57.910
- I know, I know.
- Really fucking fast.

01:57.952 --> 01:59.537
It's about to get worse.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.706
Summer pulled Haley aside and
kind of wanted to like end

02:02.748 --> 02:06.043
it all and tell her what
the fuck is bothering her,

02:06.085 --> 02:09.463
and that shit
didn't go as planned.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.132
And now we're fighting again,

02:12.174 --> 02:14.677
so this shit sucks again.

02:14.718 --> 02:16.679
- Fucking infidelity
disgusts me.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.722
I will not associate
myself with Murphy ever again.

02:18.764 --> 02:20.057
Therefore, by association

02:20.057 --> 02:21.183
with her being her girlfriend,

02:21.225 --> 02:23.227
Haley is done, too. Dead to me.

02:28.649 --> 02:32.319
[women hooting]

02:34.488 --> 02:37.283
Whatever they're saying
has nothing to do with me...

02:37.324 --> 02:38.617
...but the drink throwing, dude?

02:38.659 --> 02:40.327
It's like,
we're too old for that.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.580
I just... I can't respect that.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.498
I mean, literally,
they were getting in her face.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.624
Like, I'll literally
fight a bitch.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.750
I don't care so...

02:46.792 --> 02:48.168
If you think that's out of line,

02:48.210 --> 02:49.712
then I don't
know what to tell you.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.088
I've heard a lot of
stories about you too,

02:51.130 --> 02:52.339
so don't even
try to come for me.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.134
- Okay.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.052
- No, no, no.
- I'm over it. I'm over it.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.721
- No, really. No.
Olivia, get off me.

02:58.762 --> 03:00.389
- No, babe.
- No, I'm over it.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.765
I told you that was one thing

03:01.807 --> 03:03.100
I didn't want to
fucking talk about,

03:03.142 --> 03:04.476
and for her to
throw that in my face

03:04.518 --> 03:06.145
really pisses
me off. So I'm over it.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.314
The way that me
and Mel became friends is

03:08.355 --> 03:10.608
she had a lot of
drama with a lot of people.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.943
In my opinion,
none at her fault.

03:12.985 --> 03:16.947
People were ganging up and
bulling her pretty much,

03:16.989 --> 03:19.116
saying untrue things about
her and about her character,

03:19.158 --> 03:22.494
and Mel is traumatized from it.
She doesn't want anymore drama.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.079
She doesn't want to be
in the middle of anything.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.539
She doesn't want fighting
or all this stuff.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.749
She's not about it.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.208
- Please bring in
this threesome.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.252
This like threesome
that's agreed to,

03:30.294 --> 03:32.421
that's on both sides.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.547
This is how
it's supposed to work.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.215
It's not to be hidden.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.010
- I always want her to
be happy, obviously.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.094
Like duh.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.095
- I like love you.

03:40.137 --> 03:41.221
- Yeah.
- Wahh. I love you.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.264
She's a great person.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.643
Haley apparently
needs a fucking Oscar,

03:45.684 --> 03:47.144
because she acting like
she don't fucking know

03:47.186 --> 03:49.063
that she cheats on her
every fucking week.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.648
[Jordan]: She's acting like
she hasn't cried to me about

03:50.689 --> 03:52.149
the fact that her girlfriend is
in an open relationship

03:52.191 --> 03:54.234
and she's not.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.445
I was very inconspicuously
hiding in the stall,

03:56.487 --> 03:58.739
couldn't see my giant
boots or my ten-gallon hat.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.990
Brianna, babe.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.202
Yeah, I heard
the whole conversation.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.537
- Nobody likes her. Still,
nobody likes her.

04:05.579 --> 04:06.997
- It's funny, how they'd be,

04:07.039 --> 04:08.499
"Oh, Summer's trying
to fuck me too."

04:08.540 --> 04:10.334
Oooh. You going to put it
on your stories

04:10.376 --> 04:11.710
so you can get more followers?

04:11.752 --> 04:14.713
[Summer]: Babe,
she is not worth it.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.215
[Summer]:
We got to get out of here.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.675
- Tag me so I can
get more followers.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.343
- Losers.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.886
I feel like there's always
going to be tension

04:20.928 --> 04:22.471
when you put Summer,
Marissa and Brianna

04:22.513 --> 04:23.931
and Haley in a room together.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.432
Like, they obviously
don't like each other.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.850
They're never
going to get along.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.060
They're never
going to be friends.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.436
You don't want to be in drama,

04:29.478 --> 04:31.897
but there's
drama all around you.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.774
I just feel bad. I feel bad
that you guys

04:33.816 --> 04:35.317
were in-between this.

04:35.359 --> 04:39.822
I know you and Ali,
have a good relationship.

04:39.863 --> 04:42.783
I know they're good girls, but
sometimes

04:42.825 --> 04:45.119
- they're going to be confusing,
- I think it's a reflection.

04:45.160 --> 04:48.789
when that somebody tries

04:48.831 --> 04:51.917
to speak bad to their,

04:51.959 --> 04:53.419
- how do you say...
- They're partner.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.170
- Their partner, yes.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.630
- Whatever happened,
I'm sure they're going to figure

04:56.672 --> 04:58.841
it out so let's just go.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.552
I just wish that our
moms were not stuck in

05:01.593 --> 05:05.014
the middle of
the chaos, of the arguments.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.890
If I knew that shit
was going to happen,

05:06.932 --> 05:09.768
we wouldn't have
brought them, obviously.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.980
So it wasn't necessarily
that my mom was scared.

05:13.022 --> 05:14.690
She was just like,
well, this is shitty.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.860
- Baby?
- Come on.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.322
â™ªâ™ª

05:28.120 --> 05:30.205
[Olivia]: I'm tired,
last night drained me.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.333
You need to
start dragging me away,

05:33.375 --> 05:35.961
be like, "Olivia, come on."

05:36.003 --> 05:38.130
Do you know how many
times I told you last night,

05:38.172 --> 05:39.840
"Olivia, you're not
going to solve anything."

05:39.882 --> 05:41.717
I don't even know
what in my mind thinks that

05:41.759 --> 05:43.927
I'm helping in any way anyways.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.138
I mean, it's cute of you.
It's very sweet.

05:46.180 --> 05:48.682
You have good intentions.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.685
However, nine out of ten
times it's not successful.

05:51.727 --> 05:55.147
- [laughs]
- [imitates laugh]

05:55.189 --> 05:57.608
- Come on, you did that
so many times last night,

05:57.649 --> 05:58.609
- I was like, "Olivia."
- Did I really?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.027
Yes, you did.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.904
I thought I only
did it once or twice.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.489
- I was like, "Olivia, we've
been through this multiple
times."

06:03.530 --> 06:05.157
I'm not going to
stop doing it for good.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.992
- It's embarrassing.
- It's not embarrassing.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.870
It is embarrassing.
I laugh and then you

06:09.912 --> 06:12.706
laugh trying to laugh
like me and it's not like me.

06:12.748 --> 06:14.208
I think it's pretty close.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.751
I think it's
a little obnoxious.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.294
Well.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.879
Don't even.
Don't go there.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.298
I'm going to get offended.

06:21.340 --> 06:22.883
[laughs]

06:23.884 --> 06:25.260
Leave me alone.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.261
- Okay, I'm sorry.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.890
[text chimes]
Oh, God.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.934
[Mel]: What is this?
In the group chat?

06:31.975 --> 06:33.393
- Are you fucking kidding me?
Haley's in the group chat.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.187
We have this group text with all

06:35.229 --> 06:37.648
of everybody that's
friends in the Tampa area.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.358
Obviously, not everybody in

06:39.399 --> 06:41.401
that group chat is friends
with every single person,

06:41.443 --> 06:43.320
and the night
that big fight happened,

06:43.362 --> 06:45.155
Brianna and Haley kicked Summer

06:45.197 --> 06:47.074
and Marissa out of the group
chat.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.118
So it's like it went from having
this big chat with all

06:49.159 --> 06:51.203
of our friends to
people kicking each other out,

06:51.245 --> 06:52.746
people leaving the group chat,

06:52.788 --> 06:54.540
saying things
that they didn't say in person.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.835
"I'm not trying to
put anyone in the middle.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.003
I'm really sad right now
and sick to my stomach.

07:00.045 --> 07:02.005
I'm proud of my
relationship of six years,

07:02.047 --> 07:03.590
but I feel like it's
been a constant attack

07:03.632 --> 07:05.175
with zero backing."

07:05.217 --> 07:08.428
I just, I feel for Haley
and what she's saying

07:08.470 --> 07:10.722
and the fact that
her relationship

07:10.764 --> 07:12.349
is getting bashed in that way.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.101
However, I don't like

07:14.143 --> 07:16.395
how they treat
people and it's not okay.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
Yeah.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.939
The text from Haley,

07:18.981 --> 07:20.983
really threw
me off guard because I

07:21.024 --> 07:23.110
felt as if she didn't
apologize to everyone.

07:23.152 --> 07:26.613
It was more of an explanation of
what she expected from people

07:26.655 --> 07:31.076
and not taking ownership
of how she made others feel.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.620
Last night really, really
has me exhausted right now.

07:33.662 --> 07:34.663
It was a very toxic environment.

07:34.705 --> 07:36.165
I'm so over it.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.499
- I'm so over it.
- I'm so over it.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.500
I can't handle it.

07:38.542 --> 07:41.170
This is an issue between Summer,

07:41.211 --> 07:44.173
Marissa, Haley, and Brianna.

07:44.214 --> 07:47.509
It had nothing to
do with anyone else.

07:47.551 --> 07:50.179
And I felt bad. I mean,
even the moms got involved

07:50.220 --> 07:52.514
and they were just
trying to have a good night out.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.892
The moms deserve
an apology from them.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.852
- Yeah. They were so nice too.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.979
- I felt bad, so embarrassing.
- They were adorable.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.523
Nelly's mom was hot.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.608
Yes, she was.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.526
[laughs]

08:04.568 --> 08:05.944
â™ªâ™ª

08:09.573 --> 08:10.824
- Ready for some tie-dye?

08:10.866 --> 08:13.035
Look at you, got the setup.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.204
Yeah, I'm going
to tape it down.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.580
Nice.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.915
- You have to wet them.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.875
You can do that if you want.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.670
So that was bullshit
last night.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.297
This isn't like
the first time in

08:25.339 --> 08:26.548
the last six
years that people have

08:26.590 --> 08:28.008
been trying to break us up.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.259
- So...
- I know.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.303
Last night, Summer comes up to

08:31.345 --> 08:33.222
me and she's like
Brianna invited her CrossFit

08:33.263 --> 08:35.515
to fuck so
I know that bitch was lying

08:35.557 --> 08:38.727
and she was lying straight
to my face and honestly,

08:38.769 --> 08:40.646
she just looks like an idiot
because Brianna literally did

08:40.687 --> 08:42.064
- CrossFit a year ago and...
- Literally.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.774
...we've known her
for three years,

08:43.815 --> 08:46.276
so I'm not really sure
what her intentions were.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.737
Everybody's got
some crazy ulterior motive.

08:48.779 --> 08:50.447
- I honestly went into it with

08:50.489 --> 08:52.157
like good intentions
and I thought that we were

08:52.199 --> 08:54.284
going to like squash
whatever the issue was

08:54.326 --> 08:56.119
because I honestly thought
that there was nothing even

08:56.161 --> 08:58.205
between us that happened
that was that serious.

08:58.247 --> 09:00.207
- Obviously, there's
something underlying, you know?

09:00.249 --> 09:02.584
I mean, as for Summer,
Marissa, and Jordan,

09:02.626 --> 09:05.212
you know, this type of thing
eventually was to come.

09:05.254 --> 09:07.547
They're always fucking
scheming some shit.

09:07.589 --> 09:09.549
They're used to
their partner controlling them

09:09.591 --> 09:11.385
and I feel
like that's just not us.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.970
Because honestly
the only time I want

09:13.011 --> 09:13.971
a controlling
relationship is in the bed.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.806
- [laughing]
- So...

09:15.847 --> 09:17.349
A lot of people don't have
the connection that we have

09:17.391 --> 09:20.519
to be comfortable going
out and having a good time

09:20.560 --> 09:22.771
and not be like
holding onto each other

09:22.813 --> 09:25.565
- like fucking so desperately.
- Yeah.

09:25.607 --> 09:27.359
Like them, for example,
they're literally like

09:27.401 --> 09:29.069
hiding in the corner,
clung at the hip.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.153
Not socializing.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.613
- That's their business though.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.864
Honestly, that's their
own business.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.616
I hope they find
their own happiness.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.493
I hope they don't have to run
around trying to start shit,

09:36.576 --> 09:38.078
and Jordan's the same way,

09:38.120 --> 09:39.371
like she's never been
in a happy relationship.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.455
She's literally
cheated on almost

09:40.497 --> 09:41.957
every girl that she's dated.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.793
And as for the whole like
open relationship thing...

09:44.835 --> 09:46.253
...them saying that
is actually a joke.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.963
None of their shit
makes any sense.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.464
They say that we're
in an open relationship

09:49.506 --> 09:51.049
and I'm cheating on you.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.718
I feel like it's kind of weird

09:52.759 --> 09:55.554
the relationship between
Summer, Marissa, and Cuppie.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.014
But what's even weirder is

09:57.055 --> 09:58.682
the relationship between Summer,

09:58.724 --> 10:00.100
Marissa, and Jordan.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.686
Those three are
a little too close.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.896
And Jordan has hooked
up with Marissa too more

10:04.938 --> 10:06.940
recently from what
I heard through the grapevine.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.859
Cuppie ain't the only one.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.944
It's funny how we spoke to
Cuppie and Nellie and shit

10:10.986 --> 10:12.654
and nobody ever heard
Summer's elaborate story.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.989
- I know.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.240
Nobody's ever
heard that story before,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.742
all of a sudden
it came out of the blue.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.201
Why wouldn't
she tell her best friends?

10:18.243 --> 10:19.536
She came there with
the whole plan, Haley.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.537
- Exactly.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.372
You know, as long as
you're happy, I'm happy.

10:22.414 --> 10:23.790
I mean if I was
them I would be

10:23.832 --> 10:26.168
jealous of us
and our relationship too.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.586
- Yeah.
- So...

10:27.627 --> 10:30.589
- Enough talk about them.
- Yeah, I agree.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.549
â™ªâ™ª

10:38.805 --> 10:41.308
- Come on.

10:41.350 --> 10:43.935
Do-do-do.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.645
Good girl.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.856
I am currently
sharing custody of

10:47.898 --> 10:50.275
my dog Harper with my mom.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.777
She really helps us both.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.111
We both kind of
are a little anxious.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.488
My mom is obsessed with her

10:54.529 --> 10:56.406
and she's obsessed with my mom.

10:56.448 --> 10:57.824
So I think it's
a good balance for all of us.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.576
You mommy's good baby.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.536
I think if you talk
with anybody that has anxiety

11:01.578 --> 11:03.497
and they have like
pets they're really like,

11:03.538 --> 11:06.416
"Oh yeah, my dog's what
got me through my depression."

11:06.458 --> 11:07.501
It's like a thing.

11:07.542 --> 11:08.585
Come on, Bubba.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.172
Come on, Bubba.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.883
Honestly, I think my anxieties
started from like me

11:14.925 --> 11:16.593
holding in all my feelings
and not really like

11:16.635 --> 11:18.303
letting out my emotions.

11:18.345 --> 11:21.807
I think it kind of like built up
and built up and built up

11:21.848 --> 11:25.602
and then I had other shit
piling up too and then

11:25.644 --> 11:28.313
I kind of got just like got hit
with it all at once.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.399
Mommy is going to get
all your stuff together

11:30.440 --> 11:31.775
so you can go to nunus.

11:35.112 --> 11:36.405
Do you want this?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031
You don't want that at all.

11:38.073 --> 11:41.660
So, my anxiety has actually
been pretty well under control.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.995
But I think
that all this fighting going on

11:44.037 --> 11:46.248
has been kind of like
sparking up some new shit

11:46.289 --> 11:47.833
because it's hard like
being in the middle.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.709
I'm like super close with Summer

11:49.751 --> 11:51.461
and I was close with Haley

11:51.503 --> 11:53.088
and now they're like not
getting along.

11:53.130 --> 11:55.382
I felt like it was putting me
in a weird position

11:55.424 --> 11:57.676
and I think that that's kind
of allowed my anxiety

11:57.717 --> 11:59.886
to kind of take over again.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.179
You would think
that you would be giving me

12:01.221 --> 12:02.681
extra love right now,

12:02.722 --> 12:04.516
because you are
going to nunus house,

12:04.558 --> 12:05.600
but you're not.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.685
â™ªâ™ª

12:10.939 --> 12:12.315
[Shiva]: That shit was wild.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.651
[Jordan]: Like, I know that was
a lot over there, but...

12:14.693 --> 12:16.903
[Shiva]: Strip clubs
are supposed to be fun.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.197
- I'm scared. Why are we...
[laughing]

12:21.533 --> 12:23.785
- You get the cooler.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.871
- Why do I got to do
all the heavy lifting?

12:25.912 --> 12:28.582
- I don't know
that we'll need all of these.

12:28.623 --> 12:29.958
I don't know what
your skills are, you might

12:30.000 --> 12:31.543
be hitting
balls out of the court.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.795
Oh, absolutely not,
I'm like Serena Williams.

12:33.837 --> 12:34.880
Yeah. Okay.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.131
â™ªâ™ª

12:45.307 --> 12:46.808
- All right, one more time.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.686
Wait, that doesn't count.

12:49.728 --> 12:52.063
- That was great. You're doing
great, sweetie. To start.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.024
- Why am I so out of breath?

12:58.528 --> 13:00.614
- I need a water break.
Water.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.240
Really quick, my girlfriend,

13:02.282 --> 13:03.909
she wasn't
feeling well last night.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.368
So I'm just going to
make sure she's okay.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.121
- Speaking of women
in our lives,

13:08.163 --> 13:10.165
Reide just texted me.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.958
- Oh, you have a woman
in your life?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.043
- She's not my woman at all, no.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.294
I mean, we've been texting.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.712
Who's we?

13:15.754 --> 13:17.923
- Reide, the girl from
the softball game.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.549
Not really sure
what's going on there though.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.967
- What do you mean?

13:21.009 --> 13:22.135
She's never liked
girls before.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.054
- Hmm.
- Or any girl before.

13:25.597 --> 13:29.184
I just like don't know
what the vibe is.

13:29.226 --> 13:32.479
I met this girl Reide when I was
scouting for the softball game.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.731
She's attractive,
she's an athlete.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.233
Hey, nice to
meet you. I'm Reide.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.109
- By the way, I'm Shiva.
- Nice to meet you.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.986
Me and Reide have
been texting a lot.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.947
It's mostly like a text-based
relationship right now.

13:41.988 --> 13:44.574
I'm just getting to know her
and she's getting to know me.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.451
She telling me how
much she likes me and it's

13:46.493 --> 13:48.411
just weird
because like, she's straight.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.913
She's told me before,

13:49.955 --> 13:52.415
she's never been
interested in girls before,

13:52.457 --> 13:56.586
so it's kind of exciting to
me seeing where this is going.

13:56.628 --> 13:58.547
I got to read you
what she was saying to me.

13:58.588 --> 13:59.881
Yeah, I want to hear this.

13:59.923 --> 14:01.216
- She said, "First of all,

14:01.258 --> 14:03.009
I think you're funny as fuck.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.054
I laugh at almost everything
you say and I love to laugh.

14:06.096 --> 14:07.722
I think you're
unique and you command

14:07.764 --> 14:09.975
attention without
having to ask for it.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.602
Obviously, you're
beautiful and swaggy,

14:12.644 --> 14:14.271
but I didn't
think I needed to say

14:14.312 --> 14:15.689
that because I already have."

14:15.730 --> 14:17.440
Shiva, do you like her?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.152
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.489
But I gotta move with
caution. You know what I mean?

14:24.531 --> 14:25.532
- Why?

14:25.574 --> 14:27.200
Because she's straight.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.743
But there's a lot
of bisexual women out there

14:28.785 --> 14:30.245
that I've only ever dated men

14:30.287 --> 14:32.122
and are scared
to approach women,

14:32.163 --> 14:34.249
but that doesn't
make them any less bi,

14:34.291 --> 14:36.293
like they just haven't
ever been with a woman.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.878
- She clearly is interested
in women

14:38.920 --> 14:40.755
or interested in a woman, you.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.091
I think if given the opportunity

14:43.133 --> 14:44.467
and given the right person,

14:44.509 --> 14:47.637
Shiva would be a great partner

14:47.679 --> 14:51.141
and I think that she
has a soft romantic side

14:51.182 --> 14:53.435
of her that people
don't get to see.

14:53.476 --> 14:55.604
Reide seems to be
into Shiva and I think Shiva

14:55.645 --> 14:57.772
could use a little love
and stability in her life,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.816
so I'd tell her to go for it.

14:59.858 --> 15:04.738
I'll text her after
we finish our tennis match.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.073
I don't know that this
is much of a tennis match,

15:07.115 --> 15:08.658
I think this is more of...

15:08.700 --> 15:10.118
- Well, I was just warming up.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.828
- Yeah.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.580
â™ªâ™ª

15:19.127 --> 15:20.795
- It's so fucking pretty here.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.716
It's pretty
and it's super bright.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.134
- Guys, how do
you say this word?

15:26.176 --> 15:27.677
- Charcuterie?

15:27.719 --> 15:29.220
- Oh, I don't know
how to say it either.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.930
I will literally just point

15:30.972 --> 15:32.766
or I'll say like
a meat and cheese plate.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.184
- "Can we get a Lunchable?"
- "Can we get a Lunchable?"

15:36.186 --> 15:38.938
Whatever happened with Reide?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.940
I think we might
be hanging out soon.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.567
What's she look like?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.069
- Reide?
- Softball girl.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.112
She's the straight girl
from softball.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.781
In my romantic life,

15:47.822 --> 15:52.160
I've had one very
serious relationship.

15:52.202 --> 15:54.329
Obviously, it didn't last
because I'm single,

15:54.371 --> 15:57.499
and things with Cuppie didn't
go how I thought they would.

15:57.540 --> 16:00.543
She kind of friend-zoned me,
but I'm totally cool with that.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.587
I'm just looking to
change my ways honestly.

16:02.629 --> 16:05.548
Like, I need a boo.

16:05.590 --> 16:08.134
I'm trying to cuddle
around that fireplace.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.053
Reide is always
giving me compliments

16:10.095 --> 16:12.681
like she's always
texting me hyping me up.

16:12.722 --> 16:14.432
So I'm trying to make some
time to hang out with her,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.101
but I'm really
looking forward to it

16:16.142 --> 16:18.478
and she's telling
me the same exact thing, so...

16:20.480 --> 16:22.190
- Thank you.
- Wow, that looks fancy.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.858
- Fancy-schamnzy.
And so does your coke.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.318
- Thank you.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.279
- All right cheers to a chill...
- Are those like pistachio?

16:28.321 --> 16:29.572
- Chill night.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.658
[overlapping chatter]

16:31.700 --> 16:33.952
- Hello, hello.
- Finally.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.453
- You look so pretty.
- Thank you!

16:35.495 --> 16:37.038
- Hi, how's it going?

16:37.080 --> 16:38.248
Going good.

16:38.289 --> 16:39.999
- Hey.
- Hello.

16:40.041 --> 16:41.042
- We're here.
- What's happening?

16:41.084 --> 16:43.169
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:43.211 --> 16:44.963
- Long time no see.
- Long time no see.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.507
- Hi, how are you?

16:47.549 --> 16:48.883
- Didn't bring the moms tonight?

16:48.925 --> 16:50.301
- No, my mom's gone.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.720
- Hi!
- We're just hanging out.

16:51.761 --> 16:56.015
- This is our wet menu
that we have now.

16:56.057 --> 16:58.435
- Are your mom's like, upset?
'Cause I'm so embarrassed.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.395
- I just think for
our moms to be there

17:00.437 --> 17:02.647
to have a night out
to get to know everyone,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.941
it turned into
a fucking brawl. Quick.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.235
- I had anxiety
and I know these people

17:07.277 --> 17:09.571
I can't imagine
not knowing people.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.365
- I mean, she understands
English and she understood

17:12.407 --> 17:13.825
enough to know that someone

17:13.867 --> 17:15.702
said someone was
cheating on someone.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.162
She was like, "If
a bitch told me

17:17.203 --> 17:19.205
that my husband
was cheating on me,

17:19.247 --> 17:20.623
then I would
have done the same thing."

17:20.665 --> 17:22.459
- Haley came up to me
and she was like,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.127
"So, you believe everything

17:24.169 --> 17:26.880
that Summer's saying?"
And I was like, "What?"

17:26.921 --> 17:29.591
And she asked me again
and I was like, "Listen,

17:29.632 --> 17:31.968
the only reason
that I walked out is because

17:32.010 --> 17:34.179
you threw a drink and it was
getting too much for me."

17:34.220 --> 17:37.390
So then Haley made
a comment saying like, "Oh,

17:37.432 --> 17:39.476
if throwing
a drink is too much, like

17:39.517 --> 17:40.894
I've heard about
all the stuff that

17:40.935 --> 17:42.270
you've done."
Or something like that.

17:42.312 --> 17:43.980
- It was kind of
like a mouse being

17:44.022 --> 17:45.732
like backed into a corner
by a snake.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.734
Oh my God,
I'm not calling her snake.

17:47.776 --> 17:49.903
I felt she was literally
doing anything that she could

17:49.944 --> 17:53.281
just to like change
the subject and everyone's name,

17:53.323 --> 17:54.908
got like, you got thrown out
over it,

17:54.949 --> 17:55.909
Jordan got
thrown out over it,

17:55.950 --> 17:57.577
my name got thrown out over it,

17:57.619 --> 17:59.746
and I was having this anxiety
about the whole thing.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.539
Well, years ago,
like back in 2012,

18:01.581 --> 18:02.749
I was in an abusive
relationship so when

18:02.791 --> 18:04.626
I saw like Murphy like lunge

18:04.667 --> 18:05.960
at Summer and Marissa
last night,

18:06.002 --> 18:07.629
- it like...
- Triggers you.

18:07.670 --> 18:08.838
- Gives me anxiety.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.590
- As soon as
it got aggressive,

18:10.632 --> 18:12.175
that's why I left.
I was like, I can't handle this.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.468
I emotionally
and mentally can't handle it.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.388
The drama
between the two couples

18:17.430 --> 18:19.766
really created
a negative environment.

18:19.808 --> 18:22.018
Everyone got brought
into their problems.

18:22.060 --> 18:23.353
[Summer]: Bitch, you in denial.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.271
Your bitch slimy,
your bitch slimy.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.898
- Yo! What's the conversation?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.566
[Summer]:
That you're a fucking whore.

18:28.608 --> 18:32.028
[Haley]: I will!
I fucking will.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.447
- That's what's coming
out now, bitch?

18:34.489 --> 18:35.573
[Haley]: If you think that's out
of line, then

18:35.615 --> 18:37.283
I don't know what to tell you.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.660
[Haley]: I've heard a lot of
stories about you too,

18:38.701 --> 18:40.161
so don't
even try to come for me.

18:40.203 --> 18:42.205
Jordan shouldn't
have been dragged into it.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.957
Cuppie shouldn't
have been dragged into it.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.667
I shouldn't have,

18:45.708 --> 18:48.253
I don't really
understand when people do that.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.505
It's not really
fair to other people.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.257
It was uncalled for,
it was unnecessary,

18:52.298 --> 18:53.842
but at this point,

18:53.883 --> 18:56.052
there's not a relationship,
just move on.

18:56.094 --> 18:57.387
This is an off-topic thing,

18:57.428 --> 18:59.180
but do you feel like they
were just,

18:59.222 --> 19:01.599
let's throw some fucking plants
in this bitch's drink.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.767
- You have a garden. A whole ass
garden.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.769
- I know, but are they edible?

19:04.811 --> 19:06.020
- I think they have
to be edible.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.021
- They have to be edible.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.064
- Sunflowers.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.399
- But like on a normal basis,

19:09.440 --> 19:10.942
if I ordered a drink
from McDonald's

19:10.984 --> 19:12.694
and there was like a flower in
it, I'd be like offended.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.405
â™ªâ™ª

19:39.429 --> 19:40.889
Cuppie, how are you today?

19:40.930 --> 19:43.016
- Hey, how are you? I'm good.

19:43.057 --> 19:44.601
I feel like I've
spent so much time and

19:44.642 --> 19:46.603
energy trying to get
my mental health under

19:46.644 --> 19:48.897
control to have
all this shit going on

19:48.938 --> 19:51.482
around me and it's kind of like
stirring it all up again.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.359
I've been trying to
make sure that

19:53.401 --> 19:55.486
I don't go backwards
because I feel like

19:55.528 --> 19:57.405
I've come so far
with my anxiety.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.449
So this week's

19:59.490 --> 20:01.284
been a little bit
more stressful than usual.

20:01.326 --> 20:02.952
There's like a couple of
instances

20:02.994 --> 20:04.329
where I had to pull over because

20:04.370 --> 20:06.331
my anxiety got kind of bad
and I felt like

20:06.372 --> 20:07.957
- something was wrong.
- Yes.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.375
- I've been like having a lot of

20:09.417 --> 20:11.836
stress and anxiety
and I've been like

20:11.878 --> 20:14.005
trying to be
there for my friends

20:14.047 --> 20:15.715
and help them
get through stuff,

20:15.757 --> 20:17.592
but I don't
understand why all of a sudden

20:17.634 --> 20:20.511
now it's crumbling down

20:20.553 --> 20:23.097
because I feel like I never
had anxiety before

20:23.139 --> 20:24.682
and then a few months
ago I started having

20:24.724 --> 20:27.226
daily anxiety attacks,
like that's insane.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.020
You know, you're
a strong woman

20:29.062 --> 20:30.939
and people will
depend on you

20:30.980 --> 20:32.941
and they don't realize you're
also a human being.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.652
I... Yes.

20:35.693 --> 20:38.571
So I actually left my
position at the hospital

20:38.613 --> 20:41.115
because of
mental health reasons.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.992
I've been a nurse for
five years and I've never had

20:43.034 --> 20:45.328
an issue like
bringing home the load

20:45.370 --> 20:48.331
of my patients and since

20:48.373 --> 20:49.916
the overwhelming like overflow

20:49.958 --> 20:51.626
of patients
coming in with COVID,

20:51.668 --> 20:54.796
I began to take home
all of that negative energy.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.298
It was kind of like one of
the stepping stones into me like

20:57.340 --> 20:58.716
having my, like, break down

20:58.758 --> 21:00.343
with my anxiety
and my depression.

21:00.385 --> 21:02.178
And you'll give
and give and give until you

21:02.220 --> 21:04.430
fall down and that's not okay.

21:04.472 --> 21:06.307
Yourself is
number one on your list.

21:06.349 --> 21:07.892
Right.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.519
- Take care.
You look really sad right now.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.603
Yeah.

21:10.645 --> 21:11.938
You have a lot of sadness.

21:11.980 --> 21:13.523
Yeah.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.899
- You know you don't
have to be tough here.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.485
- I know.
- You know, so...

21:17.527 --> 21:20.989
You need to cry
and feel those feelings.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.573
I'm trying to work on that.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.617
Okay, well, we're
going to work on that.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.411
- So I'm like really trying
to focus on me,

21:26.452 --> 21:27.829
getting my shit together,

21:27.870 --> 21:30.456
so I can get back
to 100 percent Cuppie.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.291
So your job now
is to take care of who first?

21:33.292 --> 21:35.086
Myself.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.755
In doing that, you're going to
find a marked difference.

21:37.797 --> 21:40.174
This week is going
to be a change for you.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.136
Okay. I promise you that,
if you do what I say.

21:43.177 --> 21:45.763
No, I know, I'm going to,
that's...

21:45.805 --> 21:49.308
...I'm focusing on everything
going on here right now.

21:49.350 --> 21:50.351
- Perfect.

21:51.602 --> 21:52.812
â™ªâ™ª

21:56.274 --> 21:57.734
- You want red wine?

21:57.775 --> 21:58.776
- Yes, ma'am.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.446
- I know you too well.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.114
- You're going to
do it with a knife?

22:03.156 --> 22:04.991
- No one ever taught me
how to open wine, okay.

22:06.409 --> 22:08.077
- Okay, I'm not
gonna say anything.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.789
- Cheers.
- Yeah, cheers.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.961
My mom called me
and she was just like,

22:17.003 --> 22:18.379
"Just want to
make sure you're okay,

22:18.421 --> 22:19.797
that everyone's okay.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.549
Like, I got really
worried the other night."

22:21.591 --> 22:26.262
I just think that whole
night, it escalated so fast.

22:26.304 --> 22:28.431
- Summer called me and she
brought up Haley and Bri,

22:28.473 --> 22:30.099
she was like, "At this point,

22:30.141 --> 22:32.810
whoever even breathes or

22:32.852 --> 22:35.396
goes Haley and
Brianna's way is dead to me."

22:38.524 --> 22:40.359
Well what did you say to her?

22:40.401 --> 22:42.445
Well, I got quiet because
I was like, what the fuck.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.530
- I'm not okay with that and I
don't think that that is...

22:44.572 --> 22:46.157
- It caught me off guard.
- ...a fair statement

22:46.199 --> 22:47.450
because obviously,

22:47.492 --> 22:48.576
we care about
Summer and Marissa.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.161
We've known them the longest.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.205
At the end of the day,
we're our own people.

22:52.246 --> 22:55.208
We are always
going to base judgment off of

22:55.249 --> 22:58.377
how we feel and what
we feel is fair and true.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.713
- Summer called me, we kind
of just were catching up.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.673
We started talking
about Haley and Bri,

23:02.715 --> 23:05.885
and Summer fucking hates them.

23:05.927 --> 23:08.846
She made it so clear to me
when we spoke that anyone

23:08.888 --> 23:10.723
that crosses paths with them,

23:10.765 --> 23:13.059
is pretty much dead to her.

23:13.101 --> 23:15.061
So, I just felt so awkward
because

23:15.103 --> 23:16.813
the way I live my life
and how I am with people,

23:16.854 --> 23:18.439
if I don't like
you specifically,

23:18.481 --> 23:21.692
I won't ever have
anything to do with you.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.861
But if it's a friend
that doesn't like someone

23:23.903 --> 23:25.780
and they're
telling you if you do this,

23:25.822 --> 23:27.406
we are no longer friends?

23:27.448 --> 23:28.825
- For a friend to put
you in that position,

23:28.866 --> 23:30.368
I don't think that that's fair.

23:30.409 --> 23:31.911
What I'm having a hard time with

23:31.953 --> 23:33.996
is that we were all cool.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.582
We were all chilling, friends,

23:36.624 --> 23:39.752
up until three hangouts,

23:39.794 --> 23:41.587
a couple of
hangouts where we started

23:41.629 --> 23:44.048
getting around each other where
it was a fucking problem.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.884
It would just be such
a shame to feel

23:46.926 --> 23:49.220
and just to see
that friendship end.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.681
I really hope
it doesn't come to that

23:51.722 --> 23:54.267
because we have
been open-minded.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.103
We will always
love you

23:57.145 --> 23:58.938
and give you a chance

23:58.980 --> 24:01.107
and hear you out
and hear your side.

24:01.149 --> 24:04.527
But if that is
not reciprocated,

24:04.569 --> 24:06.279
I will close the door fast.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.573
Yeah.

24:08.614 --> 24:09.907
â™ªâ™ª

24:17.373 --> 24:18.875
- Off we go.

24:24.422 --> 24:27.258
- Pink or blue.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.718
Left or right.
Pink or blue pill.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.428
- Oh God, or yellow.
- Wherever.

24:33.723 --> 24:35.266
- Woo!

24:35.308 --> 24:36.976
I feel like we're like on
a four-wheeler

24:37.018 --> 24:41.022
but it's a whole ass golf cart.
We're going mudding!

24:41.063 --> 24:42.982
- Oh my God.
- Oh fuck.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.483
[screaming]

24:51.657 --> 24:53.576
[imitates screeching tires]

24:53.618 --> 24:54.577
[Olivia]: What are you doing?

24:54.619 --> 24:56.495
Beep beep!

24:59.373 --> 25:00.708
- Hi, there ladies. Welcome.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.418
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, good.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.879
- I already made
plans with Olivia, Haley,

25:04.921 --> 25:07.089
and Brianna to do
this like shooting thing.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.799
Kind of was
thinking about bailing,

25:08.841 --> 25:10.885
but now I figured
I would go and I'm just going

25:10.927 --> 25:13.304
to pull Haley aside and talk to
her about what's been going on.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.389
I obviously am super
close with Summer and Marissa,

25:15.431 --> 25:16.891
and so I don't want
like drama there either.

25:16.933 --> 25:19.560
I mean, I heard your
girlfriend was cheating on you.

25:19.602 --> 25:21.020
- With who?
- Cuppie.

25:21.062 --> 25:22.563
I would love to... Bring
everybody over here.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.190
At the beginning of your
relationship.

25:24.232 --> 25:25.900
This stuff's been
giving me so much anxiety,

25:25.942 --> 25:28.152
so I'm not quite sure
if going to a shooting range

25:28.194 --> 25:30.571
and having those conversations
is going to be a good idea.

25:30.613 --> 25:32.823
But talking around alcohol

25:32.865 --> 25:35.034
seems to not be
working for any of us.

25:35.076 --> 25:36.035
- Everybody have
eyes and ears?

25:36.077 --> 25:37.620
[all]: Yes.

25:37.662 --> 25:38.746
Okay, we're going
to be safe today.

25:38.788 --> 25:39.914
We're going to have some fun.

25:39.956 --> 25:41.374
If you follow me up the stairs,

25:41.415 --> 25:43.167
we're going to
start the training and

25:43.209 --> 25:45.753
then hopefully
hit some clay pigeons.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.923
So my loyalty definitely
goes to Brianna and Haley.

25:48.965 --> 25:50.883
Yeah, I heard
the whole conversation.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.052
- When Brianna shoves me
out of her way in the bathroom,

25:53.094 --> 25:54.512
that wasn't really cool.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.389
But I mean, I know that emotions
were high

25:56.430 --> 25:58.099
and she was like really pissed
off, so I mean that's okay.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.767
I'm not going to stop
being friends with her over

25:59.809 --> 26:01.560
one night of high emotions.

26:01.602 --> 26:03.354
- We're going to
hold the gun correctly

26:03.396 --> 26:06.274
and have you fire at
some stationary targets

26:06.315 --> 26:07.566
on the ground, then
we'll go

26:07.608 --> 26:09.277
and get in some
targets in the air.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.112
I love skeet shooting,
I feel like it's so fun.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.655
It's a good way
to blow off steam.

26:12.697 --> 26:14.156
A lot of people are against it,

26:14.198 --> 26:15.992
but I feel like
it's important to be able

26:16.033 --> 26:17.994
to have an idea on
how to handle firearms

26:18.035 --> 26:19.662
so you're not scared of them
and it's definitely

26:19.704 --> 26:21.998
popular in Florida or
anywhere really in the South.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.458
[Summer]: And hopefully...
no drama.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.627
- You want to hold on to
stuff and dwell, that's on you.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.838
If you want to have fun and
be part of what we're doing,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.131
that's probably the best choice.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.261
- Okay, we're going to
go live fire.

26:35.303 --> 26:37.388
Awesome.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.556
- I hate it.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.598
- There's another one in there.

26:41.142 --> 26:43.436
- Are you all right?

26:43.477 --> 26:44.729
You got it.

26:46.314 --> 26:47.356
Your turn, Cuppie.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.899
- I've shot like handguns
before,

26:48.941 --> 26:52.028
but I've never
shot like this big thing before

26:52.069 --> 26:54.864
and I've seen all these videos
of girls holding it

26:54.905 --> 26:56.615
and shooting and like
getting knocked the fuck out.

26:57.825 --> 26:58.909
- Put the safety off.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.328
- I don't want to do it.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.621
- This is...
- [Olivia]: You got it.

27:02.663 --> 27:03.622
- Are you okay?

27:03.664 --> 27:05.458
- Yeah. I just...

27:05.499 --> 27:07.501
- I don't want to...
- No, it's okay.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.003
...traumatize you...

27:09.045 --> 27:10.713
[Haley]: Just shoot.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.131
- Ah! I don't like it at all.

27:13.716 --> 27:15.134
- You don't like it.

27:15.176 --> 27:16.635
- All right, it was fine.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.554
- All right, pull.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.390
- Nice job. Awesome.
- Ah! Good job.

27:21.432 --> 27:23.267
- Got the safety on?

27:24.393 --> 27:26.187
Not bad.

27:26.228 --> 27:29.273
Merge.

27:29.315 --> 27:30.858
There you go,
right in the heart.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.112
Stay nice with it.
Good shot.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.198
- Ooh, feel like I'm hunting.

27:37.239 --> 27:38.240
- Safety on.

27:38.282 --> 27:39.408
- Did you hit it?
- Yeah.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.077
- She wouldn't look.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.453
She was looking away,
she's like did you hit it?

27:42.495 --> 27:43.454
- No, I don't want to
get hit with

27:43.496 --> 27:45.039
a thingy coming at my face.

27:45.081 --> 27:46.499
- Look at the bottom left.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.625
- All right!

27:47.666 --> 27:50.628
[cheering]

27:50.669 --> 27:53.255
â™ªâ™ª

28:06.560 --> 28:09.355
- All right, make them safe,
put the guns away.

28:10.481 --> 28:13.109
- Wow, that was fun.
- That's hot.

28:13.150 --> 28:17.988
I really wanted to talk
to Haley about the huge fight.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.824
My biggest thing
that I've been trying to

28:19.865 --> 28:22.701
work on is if
something's bothering me,

28:22.743 --> 28:24.787
is not holding it in
and like bottling it up

28:24.829 --> 28:25.996
because then it fucking
builds up

28:26.038 --> 28:27.706
and builds up and builds up,

28:27.748 --> 28:32.086
so I'm really trying to
focus on speaking my feelings.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.046
- Brianna, you want to
help me pick up the shells.

28:34.088 --> 28:35.256
- Oh, yeah, you know
I love cleaning up.

28:35.297 --> 28:36.507
Clean up the mess.

28:36.549 --> 28:37.925
- Pay someone to clean up.

28:39.093 --> 28:40.469
- Um, so...
- Hi.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.764
I want to talk to you.

28:43.806 --> 28:45.808
- Yeah.
- You like threw out
my name at Tangra

28:45.850 --> 28:47.184
- Mhm.
- and that was like upsetting

28:47.226 --> 28:48.769
because
I didn't expect that of you.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.896
So like that bothered me.
I don't ever say anything.

28:50.938 --> 28:52.773
I understand that you were
in a weird situation,

28:52.815 --> 28:53.774
- Yeah.
- but like I just don't want it

28:53.816 --> 28:54.942
to keep happening.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.528
- I shouldn't have
thrown your name out there.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.612
I am sorry.

29:00.030 --> 29:01.407
Obviously,
the Tangra thing like that was

29:01.449 --> 29:04.243
like a heated situation.

29:04.285 --> 29:05.619
- A shit show.
- Yeah.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.288
It was just like
going downhill real fast.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.914
I get that.

29:08.956 --> 29:10.666
Obviously, I've always
been cool with you,

29:10.708 --> 29:11.584
and I've never had a problem
with you

29:11.625 --> 29:13.085
and I shouldn't have
thrown your name out there.

29:13.127 --> 29:14.128
I was just
feeling hurt and attacked.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.671
- No, I totally get it.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.006
- And so I was just trying to
think of something

29:17.047 --> 29:18.632
that I knew would... You know?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.468
- That's what
I told myself to justify

29:20.509 --> 29:21.886
the situation cause I was like

29:21.927 --> 29:23.596
I mean, she was in a bad
spot and I get it.

29:23.637 --> 29:26.849
Me telling Summer
that Cuppie and Marissa

29:26.891 --> 29:28.559
had a little
fling on the side

29:28.601 --> 29:30.728
or something while
they were dating.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.271
I said that in
the heat of a moment

29:32.313 --> 29:33.772
just to get under Summer's skin.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.524
I just felt like
everyone was throwing shade

29:35.566 --> 29:37.568
like being like, "No drama" and
I was like,

29:37.610 --> 29:39.487
listen, I'm not
trying to have any drama.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.489
I'm just literally just
trying to talk and communicate.

29:41.530 --> 29:42.698
- I understand that.

29:42.740 --> 29:44.408
- So... I think we were all so
drunk so it was like...

29:44.450 --> 29:46.285
- I think it's hard because
I feel like we always

29:46.327 --> 29:48.078
try to have our conversations
after we've been drinking.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.747
I mean, I knew I wanted to talk
to you about this thing.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.248
I wasn't trying to have it
at the beginning

29:51.290 --> 29:52.625
and us like have
like a weird day.

29:52.666 --> 29:54.418
It doesn't need to be weird.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.379
- No, no. Not with us. I feel
like that's different situation.

29:57.421 --> 29:58.964
- I love that for us.

29:59.006 --> 30:01.425
- Okay. Well,
I'm glad we were able to talk

30:01.467 --> 30:03.928
after holding guns all day.

30:06.222 --> 30:08.766
If I've learned anything
from going to therapy it's

30:08.807 --> 30:11.477
talk out your shit,
set up boundaries.

30:11.519 --> 30:13.729
It was absolutely
not okay for my name

30:13.771 --> 30:16.273
to just get thrown out
because your feelings got hurt.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.275
So I think that having
this conversation's

30:18.317 --> 30:20.027
really going to
clear the air for everybody,

30:20.069 --> 30:21.487
so I don't have
drama with Summer and Marissa

30:21.529 --> 30:23.822
or with Haley and Brianna.

30:23.864 --> 30:24.907
- Onward.
- Fuck.

30:26.742 --> 30:28.786
- Ah!

30:28.827 --> 30:30.663
- Whoo-hoo!

30:30.704 --> 30:33.082
â™ªâ™ª

30:36.335 --> 30:37.836
[Olivia]: Just for fun.
[Amanda]: All right.

30:37.878 --> 30:39.880
- It's crooked still
but whatever.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.590
- I'm going to shoot
crooked anyway, so it's fine.

30:41.632 --> 30:42.758
- Okay.

30:44.843 --> 30:45.970
- What up, my dudes?

30:46.011 --> 30:47.888
- Hey.
- How's it going?

30:47.930 --> 30:50.015
So tonight I'm hanging out with
Reide and I thought it'd be

30:50.057 --> 30:52.351
a good idea to have
it be a group hang

30:52.393 --> 30:53.602
so it won't be like too
much pressure,

30:53.644 --> 30:55.104
like a date or some shit.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.606
So I have me and Jordan and

30:57.648 --> 30:59.358
Olivia and Olivia's
friend Amanda,

30:59.400 --> 31:00.734
coming to hang out

31:00.776 --> 31:03.112
and I think it's
going to be a good time.

31:03.153 --> 31:05.030
Remember Reide
from the softball game?

31:05.072 --> 31:06.490
The tall one?

31:06.532 --> 31:08.659
Yeah. So I invited
her here to hang out.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.369
- You like her?

31:10.411 --> 31:12.830
Yeah. So we've been talking
and like I need you guys

31:12.871 --> 31:15.291
to help me assess the situation
with her because like,

31:15.332 --> 31:17.001
- she's never been with a girl.
- [Amanda]: Oh, one of those.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.753
- But she's like telling me
she likes me.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.714
But like, I just like can't...

31:21.755 --> 31:22.840
- Is it a girl that's like...

31:22.881 --> 31:24.550
...is she curious
and she might be

31:24.592 --> 31:25.759
- bisexual but she doesn't know?
- I don't know.

31:25.801 --> 31:27.219
That's what I think it is.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.596
- I need you guys to help me.

31:28.637 --> 31:30.306
I got the biggest gaydar,
I got you.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.266
The gaydar is a real thing, and

31:32.308 --> 31:34.852
every gay person has a gaydar.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.771
If you're a baby gay
and you're not even out yet,

31:37.813 --> 31:39.898
you still have
the gaydar because

31:39.940 --> 31:42.234
you kinda know
as a closeted gay,

31:42.276 --> 31:45.529
what other closeted gays
are going to act like or say.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.114
Well, definitely have to say,

31:47.156 --> 31:48.866
Reide is definitely
throwing off my gaydar.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.326
- My girlfriend.

31:50.367 --> 31:53.454
- Oh, girlfriend.
We're using GF now.

31:55.122 --> 31:56.498
You look very pretty.

31:56.540 --> 31:57.875
- Thank you.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.628
- You told me
you like to get wild.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.004
It's absolutely not a lie.

32:03.631 --> 32:04.882
- You low-key have abs.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.801
I high key have abs.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.136
- No, low, low, low.

32:09.178 --> 32:10.971
- That's not...
- [laughing]

32:12.473 --> 32:14.141
- Why have you got
to do me like that?

32:14.183 --> 32:16.560
- Your eyelashes are
ridiculous too, I love it.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.604
It's like my
favorite feature on you.

32:18.646 --> 32:20.481
I'm just like, kind of hairy.

32:20.522 --> 32:22.733
I think you might
like those, right?

32:22.775 --> 32:25.319
So me and Reide are
totally vibing right now.

32:25.361 --> 32:27.279
Reide is giving me
so many compliments,

32:27.321 --> 32:28.989
and honestly like,
she's always given me

32:29.031 --> 32:31.200
compliments like,
she's always texting me,

32:31.241 --> 32:33.077
hyping me up,
so I'm just like...

32:33.118 --> 32:35.663
I'm really feeling it
and I know she is, too.

32:35.704 --> 32:40.334
The things that we're
doing to our planet, f'd up.

32:40.376 --> 32:41.669
Just, I don't want to
talk about reducing

32:41.710 --> 32:43.003
my carbon footprint right now.

32:43.045 --> 32:45.089
- Okay.
- You know what I'm saying?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.590
I got different
things on my mind.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.841
- Like?

32:47.883 --> 32:50.302
That spot on your shirt.

32:54.014 --> 32:55.349
- So, wait, I have a serious
question though, like...

32:56.350 --> 32:58.394
...you're not like gay,

32:58.435 --> 32:59.937
you're not like bi.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.730
You're just like...

33:01.772 --> 33:03.232
You're straight?

33:03.273 --> 33:05.025
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes.

33:06.026 --> 33:07.486
Period.

33:07.528 --> 33:08.570
Ha, period.

33:09.697 --> 33:11.782
- Well, that's good to know.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.409
- Why do you ask?

33:13.450 --> 33:17.121
- But then your text are like,
some of them are like...

33:17.162 --> 33:19.248
It's a little confusing,
for sure.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.252
I apologize.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.632
- Like, do you have a boyfriend?
- Mhm.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.219
How long has
that been happening?

33:36.390 --> 33:38.350
Just like an estimate.

33:38.392 --> 33:39.643
- Like one year.

33:41.395 --> 33:42.896
- A year?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.523
Through my text
messages with Reide,

33:44.565 --> 33:47.568
she kind of hinted
that she might have had

33:47.609 --> 33:49.445
like something going on
with someone

33:49.486 --> 33:52.448
and I kind of knew like,
she has to have a guy

33:52.489 --> 33:54.616
in the picture, like obviously
it's not another girl

33:54.658 --> 33:56.493
when she's telling me
she's never been interested

33:56.535 --> 33:58.203
in a girl before me.

33:58.245 --> 34:01.081
So I'm like, what the fuck
is going on right now?

34:01.123 --> 34:02.166
- What happened?

34:03.459 --> 34:04.918
- Oh, what happened?

34:04.960 --> 34:08.797
So, um, she has a boyfriend
and I'm over it.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.674
She just told me they've been
together for a year.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.259
I'm like, really?
Because two weeks ago

34:12.301 --> 34:14.386
you didn't say you had
a boyfriend when you were

34:14.428 --> 34:16.221
sending me those
fucking little...

34:16.263 --> 34:19.183
- No, I've read the text
messages, that's not fair.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.769
- It's not fair. And you
know what she said?

34:21.810 --> 34:23.604
She said,
"Sorry, I confused you."

34:25.063 --> 34:26.106
- Okay.

34:28.358 --> 34:30.319
- I just asked her,
"Are you straight?"

34:30.360 --> 34:31.779
And she said, "Yeah."
And I'm like,

34:31.820 --> 34:33.572
"Your text messages
are really confusing."

34:33.614 --> 34:35.115
She's like "I'm sorry
you feel that way."

34:35.157 --> 34:37.409
Some shit like that.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.578
That's like,
a little infuriating.

34:39.620 --> 34:42.247
- Oh. Infuriating?
I've no idea know what to say.

34:42.289 --> 34:46.460
I'll keep it cool but like...
It's like fucked up.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.837
To me, there is a spectrum.

34:48.879 --> 34:51.465
On one end there's straight
and on one end there's gay

34:51.507 --> 34:52.841
but like, I truly feel
like everybody

34:52.883 --> 34:54.426
is somewhere in the middle.

34:54.468 --> 34:57.137
In this situation,
if Reide is bi-curious,

34:57.179 --> 35:00.057
or if she's really
just not sure, that's okay.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.725
Like there's nothing
wrong with that.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.436
There are women that have
been married for 10 years

35:04.478 --> 35:06.188
and download TikTok

35:06.230 --> 35:07.397
and all of a sudden figure out
that they like girls.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.524
It is what it is.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.359
But at the same time,

35:10.400 --> 35:12.444
if you want to explore that,

35:12.486 --> 35:14.488
then you need to
end your relationship.

35:14.530 --> 35:17.449
- She told me she has
a fucking boyfriend, of a year.

35:17.491 --> 35:19.326
- Oh hell no.

35:20.577 --> 35:23.497
Oh, hell no.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.957
Wait then what's the text
about?

35:24.998 --> 35:26.416
- I don't know.
- What's the text about?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.377
I want to be like,
"What's your intentions,

35:28.418 --> 35:30.504
because if you have a boyfriend
then like what are you doing?"

35:30.546 --> 35:31.421
- No, please don't say that.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.340
I don't want to be
like confrontational at all.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.341
It's cool.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.218
- I don't like that.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.762
Shiva is always unclear on
what the fuck is happening.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.389
And i this Reide
girl has a boyfriend,

35:40.430 --> 35:42.307
you need to be
loyal to your boyfriend,

35:42.349 --> 35:44.726
but don't text one of my best
friends about your feelings.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.228
To me I think
you're playing both of them.

35:46.270 --> 35:47.646
Oh my God, I swear if Olivia
says something

35:47.688 --> 35:49.273
I'm going to kill myself.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.607
- No, she won't,
I'm telling you she won't.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.276
Hey, Olivia.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.654
Olivia.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.698
- I'm getting the scoop.
I'm getting the scoop.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.325
- Don't get the scoop.
- I like the scoop.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.119
You've got a boyfriend, right?

36:04.246 --> 36:06.248
No, yes, no?

36:06.290 --> 36:07.457
Different question?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.377
Why's she looking
at me like that?

36:10.419 --> 36:11.837
- I don't know what's happening.

36:11.879 --> 36:13.797
- How long have you
guys been together?

36:13.839 --> 36:16.925
- I don't know what's
going on over here, but...

36:16.967 --> 36:17.968
- I asked her how long her
and her boyfriend

36:18.010 --> 36:19.136
have been together.

36:19.177 --> 36:20.220
And she looked at me crazy.

36:20.262 --> 36:21.555
- I literally tell Olivia,

36:21.597 --> 36:23.307
don't say anything to Reide.

36:23.348 --> 36:25.934
Literally, 17 seconds later,

36:25.976 --> 36:27.227
she tells Reide
"I know you have a boyfriend"

36:27.269 --> 36:28.228
or at least some
shit like that,

36:28.270 --> 36:30.022
that pisses Reide off.

36:30.063 --> 36:33.901
Olivia just made this awkward
situation even more awkward.

36:33.942 --> 36:35.861
Like, I'm ready to
get the fuck out of here.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.280
[Olivia]: Bad topic?

36:39.281 --> 36:40.866
â™ªâ™ª

36:49.666 --> 36:51.168
- I love it here.

36:52.753 --> 36:53.837
- Table for two?

36:53.879 --> 36:56.048
- I've never been here before.

36:56.089 --> 36:59.217
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.761
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:01.762 --> 37:03.096
To us. I love you.

37:05.474 --> 37:07.142
I love you.
This is really good.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.728
How are you feeling
about seeing Summer and Marissa

37:09.770 --> 37:12.856
for the first time since
everything kind of happened?

37:12.898 --> 37:15.025
I feel like
she's not going to want

37:15.067 --> 37:16.818
to talk about it
or bring it up.

37:16.860 --> 37:18.654
So I just...

37:18.695 --> 37:19.821
I don't know, I don't
want her to get upset about it

37:19.863 --> 37:24.034
and then... be awkward.

37:24.076 --> 37:26.995
Summer gave, technically,
us an ultimatum.

37:28.372 --> 37:29.706
I just don't
think it's fair.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.541
I feel like
we're our own people.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.168
I get where she's coming from.

37:34.211 --> 37:35.462
- You shouldn't say that.

37:36.755 --> 37:39.049
- She gave us an
ultimatum, babe.

37:39.091 --> 37:41.301
You don't want to
hurt anyone's feelings

37:41.343 --> 37:42.928
and I can relate to that.

37:42.970 --> 37:44.846
But we obviously
care about them.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.014
Everybody knows that.

37:46.056 --> 37:47.891
But I think that too

37:47.933 --> 37:50.894
it's just an opportunity for
us all to share how we feel.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.604
- Our relationship with
Summer and Marissa,

37:52.646 --> 37:54.690
we're really good friends.
We talk a lot.

37:54.731 --> 37:57.150
We hang out when we can.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.236
We're similar in
a lot of ways.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.446
I feel like they've got
good heads on their shoulders.

38:01.488 --> 38:05.742
They've got a really committed
relationship. We do, too.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.536
Sometimes it's
hard to find that.

38:07.577 --> 38:09.955
It's hurtful to feel like
we could lose somebody that

38:09.997 --> 38:13.208
we hold close to us
if we get to know someone,

38:13.250 --> 38:15.127
and I don't
think that that's fair.

38:15.168 --> 38:16.795
- Oh, look who it is.
- What's up?

38:16.837 --> 38:18.463
- Hey.
- How are you guys?

38:18.505 --> 38:20.048
- How are you all?

38:20.090 --> 38:22.259
- Here is some pizza and...
- You got the flatbread?

38:22.300 --> 38:23.760
- You been up here before?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.095
No, they just
opened the rooftop

38:25.137 --> 38:26.555
I think not too long ago.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.432
- I wanted to talk to you guys,

38:28.473 --> 38:31.184
pretty much just
to clear the air about

38:31.226 --> 38:34.146
how everything transpired
with you and Haley and Bri.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.232
â™ªâ™ª

38:43.280 --> 38:44.740
- Oh my God.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.492
I'm just over it.

38:52.205 --> 38:55.333
I did invest a lot of
my time and feelings into Reide.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.128
It's pretty disappointing and
a little heartbreaking

38:58.170 --> 39:01.339
to have it end like this.

39:01.381 --> 39:04.634
If I would have known from the
jump that she had a boyfriend,

39:04.676 --> 39:08.263
I would've never
ever tried to pursue her.

39:08.305 --> 39:10.682
But although Reide led me on,

39:10.724 --> 39:12.642
I still do care
for her and I feel bad

39:12.684 --> 39:14.394
about how
this is all playing out.

39:14.436 --> 39:16.313
I'm calling her.
Here we go.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.773
It's on speak.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.400
[phone rings]

39:23.320 --> 39:24.279
- Hello?

39:24.321 --> 39:26.323
Are you okay?

39:26.364 --> 39:27.324
- What I did was wrong.

39:27.365 --> 39:28.366
So I mean...

39:28.408 --> 39:29.534
It came out, so.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.914
Nothing I can do about it.
Nothing you can do about it.

39:33.955 --> 39:37.292
I don't think you should
stress it too much, honestly.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.295
- Yeah. You say that until...

39:40.337 --> 39:42.506
Homeboy sees it and...

39:42.547 --> 39:43.673
You know what I'm saying.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.594
- Don't worry. Only
some of your texts got

39:47.636 --> 39:50.514
read out loud. I'm playing.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.765
- Shiva!
- No, I'm playing.

39:51.807 --> 39:53.266
- You're not playing.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.520
Now I know you're not playing.

39:56.561 --> 39:57.771
What do I do?

39:57.813 --> 39:59.314
I have to hang up.

39:59.356 --> 40:02.150
- It's fine.
- All right, bye bye.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.111
- Bye.

40:04.152 --> 40:06.154
First of all, I hung up.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.781
First of all...

40:07.823 --> 40:09.324
She admitted she was wrong,

40:09.366 --> 40:13.411
so we can tear apart all
the rest of our decisions

40:13.453 --> 40:14.996
and everything
else that happened today.

40:15.038 --> 40:18.250
But she outright
admitted that she was wrong.

40:18.291 --> 40:19.292
I mean, she had no
other option

40:19.334 --> 40:22.003
besides look like an idiot.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.839
I don't care if
I speak to her ever again.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.508
That's fair.

40:26.550 --> 40:27.717
- I'm two for two outs.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.177
I chased Cuppie,

40:29.219 --> 40:31.596
I chased Reide,
it didn't work out.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.390
I obviously have a thing for

40:33.431 --> 40:36.184
chasing girls
that aren't meant for me.

40:36.226 --> 40:38.228
I really just need
to cut this shit out.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.980
I guess a lot of
people know how I feel.

40:40.021 --> 40:41.982
The chase is fun but at

40:42.023 --> 40:44.025
the end of the day,
it's heartbreaking.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.527
It's hurtful to yourself.

40:45.569 --> 40:47.154
Why fucking do it?

40:47.195 --> 40:49.072
Go for someone that's available.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.533
That's what I'm going
to tell myself from now on.

40:51.575 --> 40:54.828
It's just like this
is exactly the problem.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.913
This is it.
This is what girls do.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.498
Straight, gay, bi,

40:58.540 --> 41:00.876
whatever the fuck
their sexual orientation is.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.836
No more chasing
people that are unavailable.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.630
No more friends
and no more straight girls.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.424
Do not do it.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.468
The hottest Hot Girl Summer
is approaching right now.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.054
So shout out to any
ladies watching right now.

41:13.096 --> 41:15.682
I'm single and ready to mingle.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.894
Follow me on
the gram @shivapishdad,

41:18.935 --> 41:21.646
straight up, like dad, Pishdad.

41:21.688 --> 41:22.689
Who was that?

41:22.731 --> 41:24.065
No clue.

41:24.107 --> 41:25.192
Do you want to
holler at my window?

41:25.233 --> 41:26.484
Shut up.

41:26.526 --> 41:28.111
Start from scratch?

41:28.153 --> 41:29.779
Do you have
a boyfriend of a year?

41:31.156 --> 41:32.365
Did she answer?

41:33.658 --> 41:35.035
â™ªâ™ª

41:40.582 --> 41:42.125
- So much has happened.

41:42.167 --> 41:43.543
I just feel like it's good for

41:43.585 --> 41:46.171
us all four to kind of
sit down and talk.

41:46.213 --> 41:48.590
- I feel with you it's more like

41:48.632 --> 41:51.259
if you see that we get super
close with these people.

41:51.301 --> 41:53.470
Obviously, when you guys have
a serious issue with them,

41:53.511 --> 41:55.055
I think that's when you fight.

41:55.096 --> 41:56.556
I'm cutting everybody off
that has anything

41:56.598 --> 41:59.059
to do with them in
that sense, I'm sorry.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.144
They are dead
to me and I won't be

42:01.186 --> 42:02.520
close to people that
are hanging out with them.

42:02.562 --> 42:03.980
I'm sorry, I just can't.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.274
- Yeah, at the end of the day
if you associate

42:06.316 --> 42:08.735
with certain kind of people,

42:08.777 --> 42:11.029
I'm going to assume that you're
that kind of people too.

42:16.618 --> 42:18.453
- So if we're around each other

42:18.495 --> 42:20.038
and I'm not saying
we're best friends with them.

42:20.080 --> 42:21.456
Do whatever you want,

42:21.498 --> 42:23.041
but I'm going to
also do whatever I want,

42:23.083 --> 42:27.170
whatever feels
good for me and for her.

42:27.212 --> 42:28.421
I feel like we...

42:28.463 --> 42:29.756
...are in an ultimatum.

42:29.798 --> 42:32.300
- I'm not giving an ultimatum.

42:32.342 --> 42:34.344
I'm just telling you how I feel.

42:34.386 --> 42:37.055
I didn't want her to feel
like it was an ultimatum

42:37.097 --> 42:38.723
because I would never put my
friends in that position.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.850
But, if I was told by
my best friend

42:40.892 --> 42:43.395
that something similar was
going on and she said,

42:43.436 --> 42:44.688
are you still going
to hang out with them,

42:44.729 --> 42:45.814
the first thing I would say is,

42:45.855 --> 42:47.649
how would it make you feel

42:47.691 --> 42:49.567
and are you okay
with it if I do?

42:49.609 --> 42:52.821
If somebody was fucking
doing the same shit to you all,

42:52.862 --> 42:54.489
this wouldn't be
a fucking conversation.

42:54.531 --> 42:56.241
If Ali came up to me and said,

42:56.283 --> 42:59.119
"This person has
grabbed my girlfriend,

42:59.160 --> 43:01.538
multiple times she's
grabbed fucking Nelly,"

43:01.579 --> 43:03.957
would I fucking
say hey, hey, hey?

43:03.999 --> 43:06.293
I mean, come on, are we
being fucking real now?

43:06.334 --> 43:08.503
What upset me is
that she was asking me

43:08.545 --> 43:11.214
things that I felt
should go unsaid.

43:11.256 --> 43:13.466
As a friend,
I love Nelly and Ali,

43:13.508 --> 43:15.385
and I think that them asking me
if that would bother me,

43:15.427 --> 43:16.720
hurt my feelings.

43:16.761 --> 43:17.929
We're good friends,
you should know

43:17.971 --> 43:19.347
that that would
hurt my feelings.

43:19.389 --> 43:21.349
We care about you
and it's like,

43:21.391 --> 43:23.893
"Is it one-sided?" Like...

43:23.935 --> 43:26.021
I know how I would move in
this situation

43:26.062 --> 43:27.981
and I'll watch how
other people move.

43:28.023 --> 43:31.568
We've never had
tension like that with them.

43:31.609 --> 43:35.238
And I felt like we let them down

43:35.280 --> 43:37.824
even though I don't think
that we did anything wrong.

43:37.866 --> 43:39.242
- In that moment, I was
kind of distraught.

43:39.284 --> 43:40.869
Like, what the fuck?

43:42.495 --> 43:43.580
I'm ready to go.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.582
- I just, I guess...
- I need to go.

43:45.623 --> 43:46.624
Yeah.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.627
â™ªâ™ª
