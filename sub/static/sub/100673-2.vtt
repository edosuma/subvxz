00:03.086 --> 00:04.796
   My name is Daniel Garcia.

00:04.796 --> 00:06.548
My life used to be
pretty normal.

00:06.548 --> 00:08.090
I worked at my family's bakery
in Little Havana

00:08.090 --> 00:10.344
with my mom, my dad,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.471
my crazy brother,
and my little sister.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.681
I had a girlfriend.
Life was good.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.975
Until she decided to propose.

00:16.975 --> 00:18.352
   Will you marry me?

00:18.352 --> 00:19.645
   And I decided to say...

00:19.645 --> 00:21.146
No.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.941
That's when everything
changed.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.984
I met Noa Hamilton,

00:25.984 --> 00:28.570
as in international superstar,
fashion icon,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.364
one of the most famous women
in the world  

00:30.364 --> 00:31.782
that Noa Hamilton!

00:31.782 --> 00:32.824
   What do you wanna do?

00:32.824 --> 00:34.368
More than anything
in the whole world?

00:34.368 --> 00:36.578
   Change my shirt.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.956
   Okay.
That was your first wish.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.832
   The rest of the night
was crazy.

00:40.832 --> 00:43.877
It was fun, sexy, romantic.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.504
At least
until her manager told me

00:45.504 --> 00:47.130
she picked up people like me
all the time.

00:47.130 --> 00:49.383
   It's my hope
that you leave now

00:49.383 --> 00:51.343
before you get humiliated.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.552
   So I left.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.054
I went back to my normal life

00:54.054 --> 00:56.014
figuring I'd never
see her again.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.225
You can imagine how surprised
I was the very next morning

00:58.225 --> 00:59.226
when she showed up.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.019
   I still owe you a wish.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.900
   No, I was just surprised.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.902
I mean, you tracked me down,
showed up unannounced.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.737
   Tracked you down?

01:10.737 --> 01:13.115
You make me sound
like a stalker.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.033
   It is kind of a red flag.

01:16.702 --> 01:19.329
Well, maybe I just wanted
some more pastelitos.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.872
Did you ever consider that?

01:23.375 --> 01:26.253
So why are you here with me?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.546
I mean, I talked to Lewis
last night.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.672
He told me it was  
   That's why I'm here.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.759
I wanna apologize for Lewis.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.930
What he said is true.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.433
Sometimes I like to go out
and meet people

01:39.433 --> 01:41.476
and bring them along,

01:41.476 --> 01:42.644
but it's never planned and  

01:42.644 --> 01:44.229
   Look...

01:44.229 --> 01:46.231
you took a horrible night

01:46.231 --> 01:48.025
and turned it into something
I'll never forget,

01:48.025 --> 01:50.485
so it's all good.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.904
   But it's not all good

01:52.904 --> 01:56.366
because I didn't want last night
to end the way it did.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.659
I wanted you to stay.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.290
   Was that really
a typical night for you?

02:03.290 --> 02:05.375
Rappelling down a building?

02:05.375 --> 02:08.461
   Well, the baking
was a little extreme.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.630
   I could tell,
because you were not that good.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.802
You said I was above average.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.430
You had a handful of flour
at the time.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.475
   And pretty soon, I might have
a handful of sand, so...

02:21.475 --> 02:23.101
   Oh, so then
I should really go then, right?

02:23.101 --> 02:24.478
Maybe.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.732
   Whoa!
Whoa!

02:28.732 --> 02:30.776
   Hey, are you Noa Hamilton?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.402
   Yeah.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.154
Yeah, I am,
but my friends call me Noa.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.823
   That's so sick!

02:36.823 --> 02:38.784
Hey, Mom!
Noa Hamilton's on the beach!

02:38.784 --> 02:41.036
   Does that happen a lot?

02:41.036 --> 02:42.913
   Yeah, but he was so cute.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.958
So it's my birthday
this Saturday,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.169
and Lewis always throws me
this big party,

02:49.169 --> 02:51.963
and I never know anyone there.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.382
It would be nice
to have a friendly face

02:53.382 --> 02:54.591
if you wanna come.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.970
   Yeah?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.514
   Yeah.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.782
   So, Daniel, you gonna go?

03:20.033 --> 03:22.452
To the "movie star's" party?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.163
   Well, I think  
   I got this, Daniel.

03:25.163 --> 03:27.624
First of all,
she's not a movie star, okay?

03:27.624 --> 03:30.210
She's a member
of the billion dollar babe club.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.920
   Yeah, but she's not really
like that.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.423
I think there's a connection,
but I don't know,

03:34.423 --> 03:36.049
maybe she has that effect
on everybody.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.051
   Which is exactly the reason
why you should go.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.845
To that party.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.513
To figure that out.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.223
That, and you need to bring
and play my new demo.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.020
   It's always about Mateo.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.440
   Have you met me?

03:51.440 --> 03:53.483
   Trouble.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.861
That's what women like her are.
Nothing but trouble.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.696
   Por favor,
who cares what she is

03:57.696 --> 04:00.073
as long as she keeps the crowds
coming in like this.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.752
   Guys, will you please
stop that

04:12.752 --> 04:14.421
and focus
on what really matters here,

04:14.421 --> 04:17.132
which is our boy Daniel,
our beloved Daniel,

04:17.132 --> 04:18.841
has a date with Noa Hamilton.

04:18.841 --> 04:22.179
   Uh, actually, that's...

04:22.179 --> 04:23.972
not all that matters.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.893
That's today's total sales.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.936
It's a new record.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.271
   Did you  

04:31.271 --> 04:33.648
   I checked it.
Twice.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.776
   What about the calculator?
Did you check the calculator?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.069
   The calculator's fine.
Everything's fine.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.363
That's  that's the right number.

04:45.744 --> 04:47.871
 Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah!

04:47.871 --> 04:49.873
Oh, yeah!

04:58.840 --> 05:00.967
   Maybe she can't see us.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.394
   Yesterday,
right around this time,

05:11.394 --> 05:14.272
I was getting ready
to propose to you.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.817
Today, I'm the laughingstock
of the neighborhood.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.984
   Vanessa, I know,
and I'm sorry  

05:17.984 --> 05:19.694
   Viral, Daniel.
That video went viral.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.738
The only good thing about that
is that I looked fabulous,

05:21.738 --> 05:23.365
my work phone is ringing
off the hook,

05:23.365 --> 05:25.617
and every comment says
I'm better off without you.

05:25.617 --> 05:26.952
   If I had known that any
of that would happen, I  

05:26.952 --> 05:29.037
   What?
You would've said yes?

05:32.123 --> 05:34.584
Then how could you have ended up
in bed with Noa Hamilton?

05:34.584 --> 05:36.127
   I didn't sleep with her.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.008
   But you kissed her.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.761
   I didn't do anything.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.597
Look, she was at the restaurant
and saw what happened.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.391
They saw me walking home
and next thing you know,

05:49.391 --> 05:51.309
I'm on this insane ride.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.436
I never thought that a few hours
of hanging out

05:53.436 --> 05:55.313
was gonna turn into this thing
everyone would know about.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.524
   Daniel, she's Noa Hamilton.
You realize  

05:57.524 --> 05:59.025
   Exactly.
Nobody cares about me.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.360
   I do!

06:02.696 --> 06:04.656
I do!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.034
So what now?

06:09.744 --> 06:11.246
We're done?

06:11.246 --> 06:13.248
After four years,
it's just over?

06:13.248 --> 06:16.334
   I'm just confused.

06:16.334 --> 06:19.087
It's like in the movies,
it makes it so clear,

06:19.087 --> 06:20.171
but in real life, I  

06:20.171 --> 06:21.882
   That's because in real life,
Daniel,

06:21.882 --> 06:24.467
people aren't perfect.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.594
So you choose.

06:25.594 --> 06:27.220
You can either accept them
for who they are

06:27.220 --> 06:29.222
or focus on what they lack.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.476
Look, I know I caught you
off  guard with the proposal,

06:33.476 --> 06:36.313
but we can't let that one moment
erase everything we have.

06:37.355 --> 06:40.191
I mean, come on.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.693
Look,
I'm gonna make a reservation

06:41.693 --> 06:43.236
at our favorite place.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.447
Bar Cove.
Saturday, 7:00 p. m.

06:45.447 --> 06:46.907
I say we go and have a date.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.408
Not a proposal, a date.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.409
   V, I don't know.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.493
   If you show,

06:50.493 --> 06:51.870
I'll be the happiest woman
in the world.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.873
If you don't...

06:54.873 --> 06:56.249
I'll know I need to move on.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.180
   Well, as long
as there are plenty

07:10.180 --> 07:12.223
of plant  based options
for the guests, I'm happy.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.683
   Thank you.

07:13.683 --> 07:15.101
   You know, one of these years,
I would love it

07:15.101 --> 07:16.561
if we could just have a party

07:16.561 --> 07:18.355
instead of this event
we always do.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.273
   Lewis, you know we get
more business done

07:20.273 --> 07:22.567
at this one event than we do
in all of Fashion Week.

07:22.567 --> 07:25.320
   But it's not
a birthday celebration, is it?

07:25.320 --> 07:27.280
   Exactly.
You know I don't like birthdays.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.074
Are we ready?
   Yes, let's do it.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.784
   No, wait, wait, wait, wait,
don't go.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.077
Please don't judge it.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.120
The damn paper was worse
than origami.

07:34.120 --> 07:36.122
   Thank you.

07:40.418 --> 07:44.047
   That is an original
of your mother's first cover.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.508
Took me forever
to track it down.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.010
What do you get the girl
who's got everything, right?

07:49.010 --> 07:51.137
Besides,
I had to give Pipes something

07:51.137 --> 07:53.682
to put in that gorgeous frame.

07:53.682 --> 07:56.518
   Guys, this is so thoughtful.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.813
   See, now she's gotta get
her makeup redone.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.064
I told you you should've waited.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.733
   Well, I decided to ignore you.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.902
   I remember when we shot that.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.071
Your mother had spent
the entire day

08:08.071 --> 08:09.322
shooting in the Seychelles.

08:09.322 --> 08:13.076
I mean literally
12 straight hours.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.496
But she kept on smiling.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.831
I swear, your mother
could light up a whole room

08:17.831 --> 08:19.207
with that smile.

08:20.625 --> 08:21.751
And now I'm crying.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.423
   So you like it?

08:26.423 --> 08:28.758
   I love it.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.593
And I love you guys.
   You bet.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.928
   Yay.
Mwah.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.447
   No, I'm sorry, sir.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.115
Deliveries around back
in the alley.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.243
Actually, I'm a guest.

09:13.678 --> 09:15.680
   Daniel Garcia?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.557
   Daniel Gar  

09:17.557 --> 09:19.100
Um, who are you with?

09:20.560 --> 09:21.895
   I'm sorry?
   Your company.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.146
Who are you with?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.315
   Oh, no, it's just me.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.900
No company.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.777
I'm with Ms. Hamilton.

09:28.777 --> 09:30.528
She invited me.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.530
   Um...

09:33.615 --> 09:35.158
Let him in.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.775
   All right, all right,
ladies and gentlemen  

10:08.775 --> 10:10.985
oh, sorry, wrong party.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.321
'Cause I don't see any ladies
or gentlemen here.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.909
But seriously,
I wanna thank you all for coming

10:17.909 --> 10:19.953
to this little
shindig I throw

10:19.953 --> 10:23.581
for a woman who is so special
to all of us.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.041
You know, I've had
the good fortune of knowing her

10:25.041 --> 10:26.626
since she was born.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.294
One moment, bouncy and giggly.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.630
The next, kicking and screaming.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.006
She was like that as a baby too.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.260
I kid!

10:35.260 --> 10:37.137
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

10:37.137 --> 10:40.723
for our birthday girl,
Noa Hamilton!

11:13.506 --> 11:15.175
   Okay.
Thank you.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.759
Next.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.136
Ah.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.515
Rafael's.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.018
Yes, pick  up only.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.770
Pastelitos Magnificos?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.272
Uh, well, yes.

11:29.272 --> 11:32.567
They're not listed,
but we can make them for you.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.776
How many?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.195
50?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.738
Okay.
Please.

11:36.738 --> 11:38.698
Last name first.

11:38.698 --> 11:42.452
Thank you, Mr. Gold.
They will be ready at 7:00 p. m.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.412
Adios.
Bye  bye.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.500
No more phone orders.
We're already overbooked, okay?

11:49.500 --> 11:50.752
Mi amor.
   Dimelo.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.421
   Mira.
   Ah.

11:58.092 --> 12:01.554
   Why are you
sneaking around like that?

12:01.554 --> 12:03.014
   I don't know, Mateo.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.474
Here's an idea

12:04.474 --> 12:06.226
why don't you ask me
at the top of your lungs?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.186
   Are you going somewhere?

12:08.186 --> 12:10.188
   Yeah, and I'm really late,
so...

12:10.188 --> 12:13.107
   Oh, that's right.
You need a swimsuit for gym.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.651
   Oh.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.069
   Pero, mama, I thought
we were gonna go together

12:16.069 --> 12:17.445
and have a little
mother  daughter time.

12:17.445 --> 12:20.240
   Ah, it's fine.
I've got it.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.626
   Hey, hey, hey, Natalie.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.253
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.254
Pick you up at 7:00?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.506
Never.

12:36.506 --> 12:37.632
Maybe.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.384
Actually, yes.
Yes, that's great.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.760
   Okay.
Love you.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.844
   Mm  hmm.
   Have fun.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.471
   Thomas Gold.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.683
Your mother just took an order
from Thomas Gold.

12:46.683 --> 12:48.101
And not any kind of order.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.354
50 Magnificos,
the hardest pastries to make.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.314
   Mom, how could you do that
to Papi?

12:53.314 --> 12:54.357
Who's Thomas Gold?

12:54.357 --> 12:55.984
   Tu ves?
He doesn't even know either.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.568
   Wait.

12:57.568 --> 12:59.904
Is he that star food critic
from the "Miami Sun"?

12:59.904 --> 13:01.614
   Yes!
   What?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.574
   And he just ordered from us,

13:03.574 --> 13:05.201
which means he might be writing
about us.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.579
   Yeah, I mean,
isn't that a good thing?

13:08.579 --> 13:10.748
   No.
We have a line out the door.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.542
We have customers who love us.

13:12.542 --> 13:14.544
All this can vanish
with one bad review.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.336
We can go broke.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.633
   You remember what happened
to Alberto's?

13:20.633 --> 13:21.926
Eh?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.095
Camilo's?
   Ernesto's.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.556
All wiped out.
   We have to cancel this order.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.308
   I'm just trying to help,
I'm just trying to help,

13:28.308 --> 13:30.560
I'm just trying to help,
I'm just trying to help!

13:30.560 --> 13:32.770
   Okay, mira, Papi.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.565
Look, I can do that.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.733
Or...
   Hmm.

13:36.733 --> 13:39.777
   Mateo and I can handle
everything else

13:39.777 --> 13:44.323
and let you and your magic hands
get to work.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.701
   I know
what you're trying to do.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.244
Appeal to my ego.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.997
   No, mi amor.
Not your ego.

14:05.636 --> 14:06.721
   Hey, g  

14:09.265 --> 14:11.100
   Mateo.
   Yeah?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.686
   Bring me
my original baking sheet.

14:15.063 --> 14:18.775
It's time for Magnificos.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.697
   'Cause it's over here.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.783
   Daniel, you made it.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.951
   Yes, you did.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.870
   Gucci.

14:30.870 --> 14:31.996
No hard feelings.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.500
   I accept your apology,

14:35.500 --> 14:36.959
but only because you returned
my sweater.

14:39.212 --> 14:42.048
   Piper, I think Max Everts
from Neiman's just got here.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.758
Looks like he wants to talk.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.595
   Right.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.222
Right.
Lewis?

14:49.222 --> 14:50.723
Shall we?

14:58.689 --> 14:59.732
   You made it.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.443
   Happy birthday.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.362
It may not be as fancy
as your other gifts,

15:04.362 --> 15:05.571
but this one comes with
a free lesson.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.074
   So I'm not hopeless?

15:08.074 --> 15:10.118
   You might have potential.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.495
   Oh.
I'll take that.

15:12.495 --> 15:14.497
When do we start?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.127
   You tell me.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.422
   Hmm.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.222
   So this is...

15:31.222 --> 15:32.223
   A lot?

15:32.223 --> 15:34.642
   I was gonna say
really impressive.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.893
I mean, your name  

15:35.893 --> 15:37.145
   Is melting, yes.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.188
I know.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.651
Sometimes I forget
that it's even my name.

15:48.823 --> 15:51.617
I have to go
take care of some business.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.120
But I'm gonna come back
as soon as I can, okay?

15:56.581 --> 15:59.167
And Daniel?

15:59.167 --> 16:02.003
I'm really happy you came.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.521
   Chloe, I need a dress
that sends a message.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.023
   Yes.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.650
W  what message?

16:24.650 --> 16:27.195
   A message that says...

16:27.195 --> 16:29.071
"I don't need you.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.032
"I may not even want you.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.743
"Yes, I may be sitting here
looking fabulous,

16:33.743 --> 16:35.203
"and yes,
you may think that means

16:35.203 --> 16:37.872
I want to go back
to the way things were, but..."

16:40.625 --> 16:42.793
What?

16:42.793 --> 16:44.378
Why is she everywhere?

16:46.756 --> 16:48.591
   Hey.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.595
Is he worth it?

16:52.595 --> 16:54.555
Daniel.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.432
Is he worth it?

17:00.061 --> 17:02.605
   He's kind.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.023
And caring.
And humble.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.609
He likes that I'm ambitious.
He supports my dreams.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.905
I mean, I don't have to tell you
not every man does that.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.867
Present moment
of temporary insanity aside...

17:14.867 --> 17:17.203
he's always made me
feel special.

17:19.329 --> 17:21.207
So yeah.

17:21.207 --> 17:24.042
He's worth it.

17:24.042 --> 17:27.255
Now, where was I?

17:27.255 --> 17:29.257
   "You may think I'm ready
to go back, but  "

17:29.257 --> 17:30.633
   "You may think I'm ready

17:30.633 --> 17:32.218
"to go back
to the way things were,

17:32.218 --> 17:35.012
"but things are not gonna be
the same this time.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.931
"I am not a prize to be won.

17:36.931 --> 17:39.725
I am a woman
that needs to be appreciated."

17:41.060 --> 17:42.478
I need a dress
that says all of that

17:42.478 --> 17:45.314
and also has him biting his hand
with desire for me.

17:46.857 --> 17:50.194
Which means I need more
than a dress.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.156
I need lingerie.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.851
   What's so funny?

18:21.851 --> 18:23.686
   My brother,
he's into music,

18:23.686 --> 18:25.938
and he wants me to give his demo
to the DJ.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.317
   Consider it done.

18:29.317 --> 18:30.610
   You serious?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.403
   I'm serious.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.864
   Thank you.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.744
   It looks like
you're being summoned.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.458
   Oh, nah, I don't  

18:45.458 --> 18:47.126
   It's her birthday.
She's wearing a plastic crown.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.669
You gotta go.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.639
   Payback for the rolling pin?

20:03.744 --> 20:04.787
Ay, dios mio!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.086
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.713
   It's okay.

21:20.571 --> 21:23.783
   Thank you.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.493
   It's the bakery truck.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.869
That's funny.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.537
   Just get the truck.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.253
Hey.
   Daniel.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.880
The oven exploded.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.132
How long till you can
get here and fix it?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.759
   Uh...

21:41.759 --> 21:43.052
It might be a while,
but I can talk you through it.

21:43.052 --> 21:44.094
What happened?

21:46.514 --> 21:48.015
Dad?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.684
   Dad, are you there?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.102
   Okay, walk me through it.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.771
   Open up the right side panel.

21:53.771 --> 21:56.106
Look for a silver cylinder
on the upper right.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.526
If it blew out, there should
be, like, a scorch mark.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.236
You see it?
   Yes, yes.

22:00.236 --> 22:01.403
Here it is.
   All right, all right.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.404
We can do this.
So now  

22:02.404 --> 22:04.031
Pop. Pop.

22:06.116 --> 22:08.619
How is there no service?

22:14.792 --> 22:15.709
   He's gone.
   Well, hang up.

22:15.709 --> 22:16.794
He'll call back.

22:19.797 --> 22:21.006
   I shouldn't have listened
to you.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.677
   Making Magnificos
for Thomas Gold.

22:24.677 --> 22:26.262
What could go wrong?

22:26.262 --> 22:28.264
This.
This could go wrong!

22:28.264 --> 22:29.849
   Pop.
   Ay, por favor.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.518
If you would've taken that
repair class that I'd found,

22:32.518 --> 22:33.769
maybe this wouldn't be happening
right now, huh?

22:33.769 --> 22:36.397
   That's the whole reason
that we have sons, Mari.

22:36.397 --> 22:37.648
So I don't have to take
a repair class!

22:37.648 --> 22:39.275
   Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.484
   Hey, Pop.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.445
I can fix it.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.951
I can do it, Pop.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.911
   Yeah?
   Yeah.

22:50.911 --> 22:52.621
   You sure?
   Yeah!

22:55.541 --> 22:57.251
   Okay.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.044
In the meantime,
we take some of these upstairs

22:59.044 --> 23:00.546
and do 'em in the regular oven.

23:00.546 --> 23:01.630
   Vamanos.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.798
   Mm.
   I'm trusting you.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.133
   Mm  hmm.

23:04.133 --> 23:05.885
   Yeah.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.478
   Natalie.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.479
Hi.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.898
I know this is super awkward,

23:18.898 --> 23:19.857
but do you think
this is something

23:19.857 --> 23:21.984
your brother might like?

23:21.984 --> 23:24.945
Vanessa, wow, um...

23:24.945 --> 23:26.739
There are so many things wrong
with that question.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.949
   Oh, it's just
we're practically sisters

23:28.949 --> 23:30.576
and, you know,

23:30.576 --> 23:32.494
I'm in a fight
with Noa Hamilton.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.496
All's fair in love and war,
so what do you think?

23:34.496 --> 23:36.290
   You look amazing!

23:36.290 --> 23:38.250
I think you look amazing
and that you should go in there

23:38.250 --> 23:39.209
and put some clothes on

23:39.209 --> 23:40.669
and then get out there
and buy it

23:40.669 --> 23:43.172
and I will get out of here
and get this for me.

23:43.172 --> 23:44.465
Bye.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.266
   Hey, man.
How much longer?

23:54.266 --> 23:56.644
   Sorry, we're going
as fast as we can, man.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.982
Vanessa's gonna kill me.

24:05.402 --> 24:06.779
   Ah, Noa.
   Oh, hey.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.447
Where did Daniel go?

24:08.447 --> 24:09.990
   Baker Boy?
I don't know.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.618
Listen, Terry called.

24:12.618 --> 24:15.329
You have to call your mom.

24:15.329 --> 24:17.831
Do you want me to go with you?

24:17.831 --> 24:19.541
   I'm good.
Thanks.

24:19.541 --> 24:23.003
Hey, if you see Daniel,
tell him I'm looking for him.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.964
   Yeah, I'll get right on that.

24:24.964 --> 24:26.173
   Hey.
Where's Daniel?

24:26.173 --> 24:27.841
I know.

24:27.841 --> 24:29.927
Why don't I change
into an outfit that says I care?

24:29.927 --> 24:31.095
   Wow.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.931
Here.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.724
   What is it about that guy?

24:35.724 --> 24:37.101
God.

24:51.407 --> 24:52.241
   Mira.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.745
I remember

24:56.745 --> 24:59.081
the first time I saw you.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.419
I was on stage
in between numbers

25:03.419 --> 25:05.004
and I asked the stagehand...

25:10.426 --> 25:13.095
And he said, "Oye, es Rafael,
the pastry chef."

25:14.596 --> 25:17.391
And I had all these butterflies
in my stomach

25:17.391 --> 25:19.226
and a big smile

25:19.226 --> 25:21.395
because I knew

25:21.395 --> 25:25.441
that since we both worked
at El Tropicana,

25:25.441 --> 25:28.110
we were gonna see each other
every night.

25:30.946 --> 25:34.533
Ay.
   And now here we are.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.826
30 years later.

25:35.826 --> 25:37.369
   Mm  hmm.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.663
   Watching our future
bake in an oven.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.042
   Mi amor.
Mira.

25:45.711 --> 25:48.630
That is not our future.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.007
Okay?

25:58.891 --> 26:00.350
   Okay.
   Okay.

26:05.272 --> 26:06.815
   Hello?
   Hi, Mommy.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.108
Did you call?

26:08.108 --> 26:11.195
   Happy birthday, Noa  Boa.

26:11.195 --> 26:12.780
   Thank you.

26:12.780 --> 26:14.782
   Did you have a party?

26:14.782 --> 26:17.451
   I'm actually having one
right now.

26:17.451 --> 26:19.995
   Did you get
a lot of presents?

26:19.995 --> 26:21.663
   Oh, my God.

26:21.663 --> 26:25.209
I'm literally looking
at a mountain of presents.

26:25.209 --> 26:28.587
But you know
what my favorite one was?

26:28.587 --> 26:31.590
It was a picture of you
that I had never seen before.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.344
   That's a strange present
for a girl your age,

26:35.344 --> 26:36.386
isn't it?

26:36.386 --> 26:39.515
Not as fun as a doll

26:39.515 --> 26:41.809
or a tea set.

26:41.809 --> 26:45.312
Would you like a tea set
for your birthday this year?

26:46.730 --> 26:47.940
I would love that.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.943
That sounds lovely.

26:50.943 --> 26:54.196
   We'll go for tea
at the Plaza like  

26:54.196 --> 26:55.614
like that girl
in your favorite book.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
What's her name?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.409
   Eloise?

26:59.409 --> 27:03.163
   Would you like me to read
"Eloise" to you tonight?

27:03.163 --> 27:05.833
   I would like that very much.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.839
I have to go now, Mom,
but I'll call you later, okay?

27:11.839 --> 27:14.716
   Okay, Noa  Boa.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.973
That was my daughter.

27:20.973 --> 27:23.892
Have I told you about her?

27:36.947 --> 27:38.407
   Here's your bakery truck, sir.

27:38.407 --> 27:40.075
   Thanks a lot.

27:51.295 --> 27:53.130
Are you serious right now?

27:53.130 --> 27:54.631
Come on.

27:55.799 --> 27:57.718
Yes.

28:01.597 --> 28:03.348
   Daniel!

28:03.348 --> 28:04.725
   What the  
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:04.725 --> 28:06.310
   Piper!
What are you doing?

28:08.228 --> 28:10.022
Daniel, you can't leave.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.857
   I've been here for hours.

28:11.857 --> 28:15.277
   Look, I know that,
but I think you like her,

28:15.277 --> 28:16.778
and she likes you too.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.530
   She likes everyone.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.824
That's what celebrities do.
Make anyone feel special.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.744
   But with you, it's different.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.370
   You know how ridiculous
that sounds?

28:25.370 --> 28:27.247
   I have known her
since she was 14.

28:27.247 --> 28:29.750
This "party," it's work.

28:29.750 --> 28:31.877
She hates her birthday.
That's why she works.

28:31.877 --> 28:35.589
And inviting you, well...

28:35.589 --> 28:37.174
that was new.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.677
   I have a life.
Do you understand?

28:40.677 --> 28:42.387
A real life.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.306
   Yeah, okay,
well, if you leave,

28:44.306 --> 28:46.725
you're gonna be wondering
for the rest of your real life

28:46.725 --> 28:49.436
what could've happened
if you'd just listened to me

28:49.436 --> 28:50.896
and stayed.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.919
   Hi, you've reached
Vanessa Carmen Sanchez.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.921
Please leave a message.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.007
   Vanessa, it's me.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.926
I'm not gonna be able
to make it.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.713
   What?

30:01.883 --> 30:04.469
   Vanessa, it's me.

30:04.469 --> 30:06.471
I'm not gonna be able
to make it.

30:27.659 --> 30:31.204
   My mum first got sick
when I was around eight.

30:33.999 --> 30:35.959
At first,

30:35.959 --> 30:39.129
I thought it was fun.

30:39.129 --> 30:41.006
My mum liked to play
make  believe.

30:44.217 --> 30:47.929
To be honest,
it's really hard talking to her

30:47.929 --> 30:50.432
because she goes in and out
of reality.

30:50.432 --> 30:52.309
It's really hard to watch.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.521
   I had no idea.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.190
   Well...

30:58.190 --> 31:01.401
yeah.

31:01.401 --> 31:03.278
It's not something I talk about
a lot.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.990
That's life, right?

31:11.661 --> 31:14.790
   And you don't have
any brothers or sisters?

31:16.958 --> 31:19.419
   What?

31:19.419 --> 31:21.171
   I can't remember the last time

31:21.171 --> 31:24.466
someone didn't know
everything about me.

31:24.466 --> 31:26.885
It's nice.

31:26.885 --> 31:28.929
You just know me for me.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.809
   Everybody knowing everything?

31:33.809 --> 31:36.228
I don't think
I could handle that.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.855
   It's not all bad.

31:38.855 --> 31:41.691
I mean, overall,
my life turned out pretty good.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.321
   And yet you still don't like
your birthdays.

31:46.321 --> 31:47.489
   Mm.

31:51.576 --> 31:55.080
When I was little,
my dad would always miss them.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.041
And then when I was ten,

31:58.041 --> 31:59.835
my mum had a really bad episode

31:59.835 --> 32:02.295
at my birthday party.

32:02.295 --> 32:04.840
So that was when I decided

32:04.840 --> 32:08.260
I was done with birthdays.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.553
   I'm sorry.

32:09.553 --> 32:10.762
   It's okay.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.641
They're just, like,
work events now.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.102
Speaking of which,
I should probably get back

32:17.102 --> 32:19.729
to "working" my birthday party.

32:22.774 --> 32:24.067
   Let's get out of here.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.778
   What?

32:26.778 --> 32:28.321
   Noa, let's get out of here.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.702
   I can't just leave.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.287
   Why not?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.914
   Well, it's my party.
I think people would notice.

32:37.914 --> 32:39.374
   Exactly.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.126
It's your party.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.128
Your birthday.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.547
Change into something fun.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.257
   Fun like what?

32:47.257 --> 32:48.550
   You'll see.

32:58.894 --> 33:00.353
   MC Cubano speaking.

33:00.353 --> 33:01.563
Psych!

33:01.563 --> 33:03.023
It's my voicemail.
Hit it.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.278
   You go to Deering, right?

33:08.278 --> 33:10.071
   Yeah.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.781
   Waiting on a ride, huh?

33:11.781 --> 33:12.657
   My brother.

33:12.657 --> 33:13.909
   My mom.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.829
Jeans.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.372
   Swimsuit.
   Ugh.

33:19.372 --> 33:20.832
If there's a hell,

33:20.832 --> 33:22.918
it's filled with dressing rooms
and swimsuits.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.170
   Yeah, and I just lived it.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.505
   Why is it so horrible?

33:27.505 --> 33:30.634
   It must be the fabric
or the lighting, the mirrors...

33:30.634 --> 33:32.302
   The whole concept.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.971
Let's wrap you in 1/4 inch
of stretchy fabric.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.765
   And my mom wanted
to come with me today.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.433
   Mine too.

33:38.433 --> 33:39.643
It's like she forgot
what it's like to be young.

33:39.643 --> 33:41.186
   Yeah.

33:41.186 --> 33:43.730
   No, I don't wanna model
for you, Mom.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.316
   I just wanna get in and out
of there as quickly as possible.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.442
   Like Navy SEALs.
   Yeah.

33:50.904 --> 33:52.822
That's my ride.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.491
It was nice meeting you.

33:54.491 --> 33:55.533
   You too.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.627
   Hey.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.379
Want a ride home?

34:12.884 --> 34:15.344
   One, two, three, four!

34:35.572 --> 34:38.868
I fixed it.

34:39.953 --> 34:41.705
   I did it!
I did it!

34:41.705 --> 34:43.123
I did it!
I did it!

34:43.123 --> 34:44.958
   Ese mijo!
Ese mijo!

34:44.958 --> 34:47.043
   Yeah!

34:48.585 --> 34:49.963
   Oh.

35:00.682 --> 35:03.101
   I did everything right.
I swear.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.526
What?

35:12.944 --> 35:14.029
What?

35:14.029 --> 35:15.739
You're not mad at me?

35:15.739 --> 35:17.407
   No, mijo.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.285
I love you for trying,
and you made it work.

35:21.286 --> 35:22.579
   Yeah, papi.
You know what?

35:22.579 --> 35:24.748
Sometimes
you just have to laugh.

35:24.748 --> 35:25.749
Riete.

35:27.792 --> 35:29.127
   Uh, hello?

35:29.127 --> 35:30.378
Geez!

35:31.671 --> 35:35.008
Dare I ask
what's with the mood lighting?

35:35.008 --> 35:37.510
   Nat, I'm sorry.
I was supposed to pick you up.

35:37.510 --> 35:39.054
   I know.
It's okay though.

35:39.054 --> 35:40.388
I got a ride home.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.896
   Uh...

35:47.896 --> 35:48.980
Look at your mother.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.190
   What?
What?

35:50.190 --> 35:51.358
   Who gave you this ride?

35:51.358 --> 35:53.860
Because I'm thinking
maybe it was a cute boy?

35:53.860 --> 35:55.987
Huh?
Hmm?

35:55.987 --> 35:56.988
   Was it?

35:56.988 --> 35:58.406
   Put down the flashlight.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.497
   Whoa.
I said to wear something  

36:05.497 --> 36:07.290
   Fun.
This is fun.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.625
Fine.
Next time, I'll wear sweats.

36:08.625 --> 36:10.085
   Where are we going?

36:10.085 --> 36:11.544
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

36:11.544 --> 36:13.213
Are you leaving?

36:13.213 --> 36:14.255
With this guy?

36:15.548 --> 36:17.467
   Well, you know,
it is my birthday.

36:17.467 --> 36:18.968
   Just go.

36:18.968 --> 36:20.887
   That was easy.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.847
   But be back by midni  

36:22.847 --> 36:25.558
it is midnight.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.648
   You know Daniel is an idiot,
right?

36:31.648 --> 36:33.274
I mean...

36:33.274 --> 36:34.693
you are beautiful.

36:34.693 --> 36:37.654
And smart.
And kind.

36:37.654 --> 36:38.780
Screw him!

36:40.365 --> 36:43.785
   I know every book and
magazine article say walk away.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.955
Fighting for a man is just
a sign of low self  esteem.

36:46.955 --> 36:49.207
I think they're wrong.

36:49.207 --> 36:52.419
I think love
isn't always perfect.

36:52.419 --> 36:54.504
I think sometimes
a person loses their way,

36:54.504 --> 36:56.423
becomes infatuated, right?

36:56.423 --> 36:59.509
Like, Daniel is off
in his little fantasy world.

36:59.509 --> 37:00.802
I can feel it.

37:00.802 --> 37:02.137
But you know what?

37:02.137 --> 37:04.514
He doesn't belong there, Chloe.

37:04.514 --> 37:06.725
He doesn't.
And he's gonna realize that.

37:06.725 --> 37:09.894
They all are.
His whole family.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.815
And I'm gonna remind them

37:13.815 --> 37:16.276
that Vanessa Princesa

37:16.276 --> 37:19.779
is the real happily ever after.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.533
Get a pen.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.744
It's time to start planning.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.913
That's it, papi!

37:28.913 --> 37:30.874
   Yeah?
   Yes!

37:30.874 --> 37:32.083
   Hey, Pop.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.877
   Good news.
I found the breaker.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.628
   Yeah, I got more good news.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.172
Thomas Gold is here.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.263
   I ordered 50.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.348
   I know, but our oven broke.

37:48.933 --> 37:50.310
   We fixed it, it broke again.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.354
This was all I could manage.
I'm sorry.

37:53.354 --> 37:54.939
No charge
for your inconvenience.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.818
   Gracias.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.205
   You know who I am?

38:15.376 --> 38:18.463
I publish my column
every Monday.

38:18.463 --> 38:22.175
I'd have your ovens fixed
by Tuesday morning.

38:22.175 --> 38:25.762
Huh.
Mmm.

38:35.980 --> 38:36.981
   All right.
   Okay.

38:36.981 --> 38:37.982
   That's  
   Whoa.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.317
   That's enough.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.652
Aw, come on!
   Thank you. Thank you!

38:40.652 --> 38:41.861
   Ay, be quiet!

38:41.861 --> 38:42.946
   Oh, very sweet.

38:42.946 --> 38:44.113
Hey, it's Daniel.

38:44.113 --> 38:45.281
   Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is he at the party?

38:45.281 --> 38:47.075
   Is he still with her?

38:47.075 --> 38:48.535
   I don't know.
He sent a link.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.537
   Well, click it!

38:55.458 --> 38:56.376
That's my song.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.211
   What?

38:58.211 --> 39:00.713
   Noa Hamilton is playing
my song at her party.

39:01.923 --> 39:04.717
Ay, dios mio, papi!

39:12.308 --> 39:13.852
   Sour, but it's delicious,
right?

39:13.852 --> 39:15.687
   Mm  hmm.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.815
What I love about food is that
it's all about combinations.

39:18.815 --> 39:20.066
   Mm  hmm.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.109
   The two
most unlikely ingredients

39:21.109 --> 39:22.777
make the best combination.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.279
For example,

39:24.279 --> 39:25.905
prosciutto and melon.

39:25.905 --> 39:28.950
   You named
the most obvious one.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.577
I got a good one.

39:30.577 --> 39:33.329
Pineapple and goat cheese.

39:33.329 --> 39:35.707
   Yeah, that's pretty good.

39:35.707 --> 39:37.292
Bacon and ice cream.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.460
   A little heavy,
but what about...

39:41.212 --> 39:43.673
Vietnamese banana flower
and fish sauce.

39:43.673 --> 39:45.550
   Oh, my God, really?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.719
   Playing the world traveler
card again.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.262
   I knew you'd like that one.

39:58.855 --> 40:00.148
   I got an idea.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.486
   I thought I was supposed
to do that.

40:05.486 --> 40:09.032
   Well, who needs a candle
when you've got those?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.486
   I have an idea.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.779
   Yeah?

40:47.779 --> 40:50.156
   Let's go for a swim.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.743
   But I don't have my swimsuit.

40:53.743 --> 40:56.162
   Neither do I.

40:56.162 --> 40:59.624
   Watch your step!

41:06.881 --> 41:08.800
   Is the birthday curse broken?

41:13.221 --> 41:14.973
   What?
   Curse is broken.

41:14.973 --> 41:18.017
   Cool.

41:18.017 --> 41:21.729
   I'm filming in Puerto Rico
next week.
