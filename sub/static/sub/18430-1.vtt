              Mary.

01:18.963 --> 01:20.129
      <i> How's the book tour?</i>

01:20.231 --> 01:20.896
          I have news.

01:20.998 --> 01:22.498
        I'm coming home.

01:22.600 --> 01:23.165
          What? Really?

01:23.267 --> 01:24.066
              Now?

01:24.168 --> 01:25.968
    I thought you had another
           two weeks.

01:26.070 --> 01:29.037
 Well, I'm gonna bring the book
 tour home and Laurie Lawrence.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.373
    She's coming to the house
        on Christmas Eve.

01:31.475 --> 01:32.875
      <i> She's going to do a</i>
      <i> retrospective on me</i>

01:32.977 --> 01:34.877
<i>and the release of my new book.</i>

01:34.979 --> 01:36.879
  How are the projected sales?

01:36.981 --> 01:38.914
          Ok. I guess.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.883
   I'm not expecting it to be
         a best seller.

01:40.985 --> 01:42.451
          And why not?

01:42.553 --> 01:43.819
        Have you read it?

01:45.289 --> 01:46.522
             Um, no.

01:46.624 --> 01:51.860
 I um... I uh... I uh, I haven't
    had the- the time. Um...

01:51.962 --> 01:53.395
       I sent you a copy.

01:53.497 --> 01:55.531
    It's a busy time of year
             for me.

01:55.633 --> 01:58.133
   I got the annual Christmas
           car sale...

01:59.703 --> 02:00.602
            Yeah, ok.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.704
   By the way... Sadie has not
           been coming

02:02.807 --> 02:06.074
 to her figure skating practice.

02:06.177 --> 02:07.242
       ( phone vibrates )

02:07.311 --> 02:08.377
        Oh, dad, hold on.

02:08.479 --> 02:10.579
         Rob is calling.

02:10.681 --> 02:12.648
     I'm going to conference
             him in.

02:12.716 --> 02:14.583
       Hey Rob, you're on
       with James and me.

02:14.685 --> 02:17.019
      Mary, I'm on vacation
     so this will be quick.

02:17.121 --> 02:19.121
  I had sales do some consumer
            research

02:19.223 --> 02:20.656
         and the general
          consensus is

02:20.724 --> 02:22.057
      your book would sell
       a whole lot better

02:22.159 --> 02:24.693
 if you were in a relationship.

02:24.795 --> 02:26.261
              What?

02:26.330 --> 02:27.362
       They'd rather take
         marriage advice

02:27.464 --> 02:31.300
   from someone who's married
     rather than... single.

02:31.368 --> 02:32.234
   <i> It would look really great</i>

02:32.336 --> 02:33.535
    <i> if you could have a man</i>
          <i> on your arm</i>

02:33.604 --> 02:35.103
 <i> for the Laurie Lawrence show.</i>

02:35.206 --> 02:36.138
      How about Jess Hardy?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.739
   He's rich, has that private
          jet you like.

02:37.842 --> 02:41.043
      He's a self-centered,
       hypocritical jerk!

02:41.145 --> 02:42.611
   <i> I sort of agree with you.</i>

02:42.713 --> 02:44.279
        Jess won't work.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.882
     Well, I have a friend,
    runs this dating service.

02:46.984 --> 02:48.417
      We could buy someone.

02:48.519 --> 02:50.285
            Rob, no.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.554
      Brilliant idea, Rob.

02:52.656 --> 02:53.889
   <i> Hey, sorry, I gotta split.</i>

02:53.991 --> 02:55.290
        Mary, get someone
          on your side

02:55.392 --> 02:56.425
         for the Laurie
       Lawrence interview

02:56.527 --> 02:58.293
   or you might be looking at
      a dismal book launch.

02:58.395 --> 02:59.761
              Ciao.

03:01.065 --> 03:01.797
             I know.

03:01.899 --> 03:03.398
          I'll ask Tom.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.434
      He's your ex-husband.

03:05.536 --> 03:07.469
    We're in a custody battle
   that's still not finished.

03:07.571 --> 03:08.804
      <i> How would that look?</i>

03:08.906 --> 03:09.972
            Exactly.

03:10.074 --> 03:12.507
        If I were to work
        on my divorce...

03:12.610 --> 03:14.576
    If your mother were alive
         to hear this...

03:14.678 --> 03:17.279
   She's turning in her grave.

03:17.381 --> 03:18.647
       It's all show, dad.

03:18.749 --> 03:22.551
Once Laurie Lawrence leaves town
 we'll revert to the status quo.

03:22.653 --> 03:23.919
       <i> He'll play along.</i>

03:24.021 --> 03:27.322
 No he won't, he's- he's dating
          that fireman.

03:27.424 --> 03:28.457
             Woman.

03:28.559 --> 03:30.025
             Jenny.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.994
  Oh. You're forgetting he has
         two weaknesses.

03:32.096 --> 03:35.697
      Sadie and Christmas.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.599
         <i> Horrible plan.</i>

03:37.701 --> 03:40.302
    This book was a bad idea
         from the start.

03:40.404 --> 03:41.737
           I gotta go.

03:42.773 --> 03:44.072
            Perfect.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.150
 <i> ( TV commercial ) Hello there.</i>
        <i> It's Honest Jay,</i>

03:55.252 --> 03:57.452
      and it's my favourite
          time of year.

03:57.554 --> 03:58.921
      The Christmas season.

03:58.989 --> 04:02.858
   For the month of December,
if you buy a car from Honest Jay

04:02.960 --> 04:05.227
         and it snows on
         Christmas Day,

04:05.329 --> 04:07.529
         I will give you
       that car for free.

04:07.631 --> 04:10.032
     Yesiree, you heard me.

04:10.134 --> 04:12.234
    <i> My deals are solid gold.</i>

04:12.303 --> 04:13.135
            Just ask.

04:13.237 --> 04:15.237
   Just ask my best customer,

04:15.306 --> 04:18.473
     two-time gold medalist
         Mary Hamilton.

04:18.575 --> 04:20.108
     The only dealer you can
             trust,

04:20.177 --> 04:21.877
     or his name wouldn't be

04:21.978 --> 04:24.046
  ( simultaneous ) Honest Jay.

04:24.148 --> 04:26.648
           Honest Jay.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.827
      Abandoned house fire,
      kids playing inside.

04:38.929 --> 04:40.729
      It doesn't sound like
        they all got out.

04:42.800 --> 04:44.166
       You ready, Parker?

04:45.936 --> 04:48.537

04:48.639 --> 04:49.571

05:19.737 --> 05:20.869
     I'll check downstairs.

05:20.971 --> 05:22.104
    I'll check the bedrooms!

         Where's Parker?

06:36.914 --> 06:37.913
         You're alright.

06:38.015 --> 06:39.548

            I'm out!

07:40.978 --> 07:41.576
        Move it, Parker!

07:41.645 --> 07:43.345
    The place is gonna crash!

07:45.983 --> 07:46.882
             Jenny!

07:46.984 --> 07:47.716

          ( cries out )

08:03.367 --> 08:04.533
         I owe you one.

08:04.635 --> 08:07.769
    We cut it fine that time.

08:07.838 --> 08:09.704
     What're you doing here?

08:09.806 --> 08:11.072
     We were on our way home
      from the hockey game.

08:11.175 --> 08:12.574
           Are you ok?

08:12.676 --> 08:14.509
              Yeah.

08:15.979 --> 08:17.579
             Jenny!

08:19.783 --> 08:21.550
               Hi!

08:28.742 --> 08:30.675
       What are you doing?

08:30.777 --> 08:34.312
 Doctor said if I keep it loose
    my knee will heal faster.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.981
  You're lucky it didn't break.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.883
     You should be at home,
            resting.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.452
        Uh, no thank you.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.653
        I need the money.

08:41.755 --> 08:44.656
    Besides, it's Christmas,
            you know.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.025
  Well, just don't hold me up.

08:47.127 --> 08:50.161
           Yeah, yeah.

08:50.264 --> 08:52.163
    You're buying breakfast.

08:52.266 --> 08:54.466
            Oh, yeah.

09:01.975 --> 09:04.676
         James Hamilton.

09:04.778 --> 09:07.112
      Hey, move that truck!

09:11.785 --> 09:13.318
        Move that truck.

09:13.420 --> 09:15.320
       I'm in a fire zone,
          Mr. Hamilton.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.523
   In front of my dealership.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.560
  I'm on town council and I've
 spoken to the mayor about this.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.863
      This is not the fire
 department's assigned parking.

09:24.932 --> 09:28.333
 Well, actually it's a fire zone
         so it kinda is.

09:28.435 --> 09:29.768
           Very smart.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.703
    You know there's only two
    more days until Christmas

09:31.805 --> 09:34.906
    and I'm expecting a huge
        influx of people.

09:35.008 --> 09:38.009
    One of these Christmases
    it's actually gonna snow.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.245
     I haven't lost that bet
          in 30 years.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.813
       I'll take a chance.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.214
             Daddy!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.115
              Mary.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.216
              Hey.

09:45.319 --> 09:46.785
           Ah, great.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.919
      How was your flight?

09:48.021 --> 09:49.955
            Splendid.

09:50.057 --> 09:50.889
   It's good to have you home.

09:50.991 --> 09:51.690
          Let's go eat.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.557
              Yeah.

09:52.659 --> 09:53.491
      It's good to be home.

09:53.594 --> 09:54.392
    You know? You look great.

09:54.494 --> 09:55.360
     What do you feel like?

09:55.462 --> 09:56.728
    Uh, I feel like waffles.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.429
       We're getting food.

09:57.531 --> 09:58.163
            Waffles?

09:58.265 --> 09:59.030
              Food.

09:59.132 --> 10:00.432
         You gotta watch
        your cholesterol.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.267
         There's Jenny!

10:02.369 --> 10:03.368
    Get me something healthy.

10:03.470 --> 10:04.603
              Hey!

10:04.705 --> 10:05.570
            Hi Jenny.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.038
        Hey, how are you?

10:07.140 --> 10:07.906
            Perfect.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.240
 I have gifts for the toy drive.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.109
     No way, that's awesome.

10:11.211 --> 10:11.843
            So many.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.711
           Thank you.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.212
         You're welcome.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.880
        Hey, how did your
         hockey game go?

10:15.983 --> 10:16.748
             We won!

10:16.850 --> 10:17.983
       Of course you did!

10:18.085 --> 10:18.984
         Just a second.

10:19.086 --> 10:19.884
          That's great.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.019
 I'm sorry I couldn't be there.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.622
   It's ok, you were too busy
         saving people.

10:25.292 --> 10:25.924
              Hey.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.892
     Hello my little angel!

10:27.995 --> 10:29.127
              Mom!

10:29.229 --> 10:29.894
               Hi!

10:29.997 --> 10:31.496
              Mary.

10:32.833 --> 10:33.798
              Mary?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.500
       What... just one...

10:38.271 --> 10:39.471
          How are you?

10:39.573 --> 10:40.705
              Good.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.474
   I had so much fun with dad.

10:42.576 --> 10:44.909
   We started a new collection
        for the toy drive

10:45.012 --> 10:47.779
      and my hockey team is
       in the semi-final!

10:47.881 --> 10:49.781
    You missed figure skating
            practice.

10:49.883 --> 10:52.250
       The competition is
          in two weeks.

10:52.352 --> 10:55.253
   But that's when the hockey
        semi-finals are.

10:55.355 --> 10:59.557
 Some things are more important
          than others.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.861
 <i> ( speaker ) Honest Jay, please</i>
      <i> come to the office.</i>

11:04.031 --> 11:06.731
      Sadie, honey, hockey
          is for boys.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.633
   Us girls, we figure skate.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.602
   But there's two other girls
           on my team.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.303
    It's a co-ed team, Mary.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.174
     You know how important
 figure skating is to my father.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.276
    Don't force your desires
             on her.

11:18.378 --> 11:19.844
     Dad didn't pick hockey.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.180
             I did.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.648
          Brainwashed.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.684
    Hey, he's a great father.

11:25.752 --> 11:29.287
Uh, Jenny, don't you have a fire
    to put out or something?

11:29.389 --> 11:30.989
      You should have seen
       the one last night.

11:31.091 --> 11:32.157
       You went to a fire?

11:32.259 --> 11:33.324
           A big one.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.592
   We were driving by, it was-

11:34.695 --> 11:35.994
  And Jenny saved a little boy.

11:36.096 --> 11:36.795
            Did she?

11:36.897 --> 11:37.696
              Yeah.

11:37.798 --> 11:39.230
        And then we went
      for ice cream after.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.098
            Oh, hey.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.167
     So you two are dating?

11:42.269 --> 11:45.070
     College friends is what
            dad says.

11:45.172 --> 11:45.970
            College?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.639
           Oh, I see.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.175
      We met before college
        in the Olympics.

11:50.277 --> 11:51.109
           Hey, look.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.711
       I'm not looking to
       complicate things.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.447
       Yeah, you've opened
a freight train of complication.

11:55.549 --> 11:56.881
   Tom, I need to talk to you.

11:56.983 --> 11:57.882
           Privately.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.919
              Uh...

12:01.021 --> 12:02.554
       I need Sadie back.

12:02.656 --> 12:04.823
   But you said I can have her
           this year.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.357
  And now I'm taking her back.

12:06.460 --> 12:07.959
    It's officially my year.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.160
            Don't...

12:09.262 --> 12:11.429
     Look. I need your help.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.831
 There's a lot of people coming
            into town

12:12.933 --> 12:15.867
   to celebrate the release of
   my book and promote sales.

12:15.969 --> 12:18.169
    I need you to play along.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.537
     We're repairing things.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.705
   Things? What- what things?

12:20.807 --> 12:21.506
          Our marriage.

12:21.608 --> 12:22.640
             What?!

12:22.743 --> 12:24.676
    Play along or I petition
   the judge for full custody

12:24.778 --> 12:27.712
 and Sadie ends up at St. Agnes
    Girl's School in London.

12:27.814 --> 12:29.414
      Would you like that?

12:29.516 --> 12:30.548
    That would never happen.

12:30.650 --> 12:33.118
           Oh, really?

12:33.220 --> 12:35.954
 Well, maybe I'll just keep her
    until after the new year.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.088
       You wouldn't dare.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.423
              Hmm.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.525
Look, I have these gifts for her
  and they're very special, ok?

12:40.627 --> 12:41.993
    She needs them Christmas
            morning.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.195
         It's important.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.899
     Well then have a lovely
       Christmas morning.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.768
 Alone, or with what's her name.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.002
      Jenny. You know that.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.771
            Whatever.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.173
      Mary, you need to go.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.941
 Neighbour called, says there's
      a strange van parked

12:57.043 --> 12:58.109
        in our driveway.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.545
  It's the film crew setting up
       to film the teaser.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.580
      Teaser? What, today?

13:02.682 --> 13:05.216
      Yeah, it's to promote
   the Christmas Eve special.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.187
    What's wrong with parking
         on the street?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.455
         Sadie, come on.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.423
            Let's go.

13:12.526 --> 13:15.426
   But I thought I was staying
            with dad.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.228
 Well, plans change, sweetheart.

13:17.297 --> 13:17.829
              Just-

13:17.931 --> 13:18.563
     Mommy needs your help.

13:18.698 --> 13:19.731
  Go with your mom, ok, kiddo?

13:19.833 --> 13:22.133
      I'll call you later.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.034
           Bye Jenny.

13:23.136 --> 13:23.735
          Bye sweetie.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.370
          See you soon.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.204
            Bye dad.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.305
       See ya, sweetheart.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.339
            Love you.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.308
        I love you, too.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.310
              Hey.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.411
      Chop chop, let's go.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.213
          I always win.

13:35.315 --> 13:35.980
            <i> Bye dad.</i>

13:36.082 --> 13:36.848
           Bye Jenny.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.484
See you. I'll talk to you later.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.755
      And you married her?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.958
       It wasn't always...

13:47.060 --> 13:47.926
       no, you know what?

13:48.028 --> 13:52.730
     It was actually always
         just like that.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.798
      We all make mistakes

13:53.900 --> 13:58.803
 and I chose not to keep living
         in mine, so...

13:58.905 --> 14:00.905
      Walk me to the shop?

14:01.007 --> 14:02.273
               Ok.

14:06.813 --> 14:08.513
  I was really looking forward
        to watching Sadie

14:08.615 --> 14:10.515
     open her gifts with us.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.984
     So Mary's keeping her?

14:13.086 --> 14:14.018
             Maybe.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.087
             Tom...

14:22.629 --> 14:24.896
    Do you remember the night
          we first met?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.464
            Uh, yeah.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.033
     Last year's toy drive.

14:29.135 --> 14:33.471
   You were the most beautiful
     woman in the firehouse.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.306
      I was the only woman
        in the firehouse.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.375
          That's true.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.244
   What was that line you used
             on me?

14:39.346 --> 14:41.012
               Oh.

14:41.114 --> 14:44.182
      "I checked it twice,
   you're on my naughty list."

14:44.284 --> 14:45.049
         Pretty smooth.

14:45.151 --> 14:48.353
    I don't know about that.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.089
   Yeah, you took pity on me.

14:51.191 --> 14:54.025
 You were the most tightly-wound
       man I had ever met.

14:54.127 --> 14:55.727
    Hey, I had just given up
            my career

14:55.829 --> 14:57.328
      and moved here to be
         close to Sadie.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.063
            Exactly.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.833
   Tom, you would do anything
       for your daughter.

15:01.935 --> 15:06.571
     Don't let some has-been
   ice skater push you around.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.275
  One of the reasons I fell for
 you is that you never give up.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.009
           Oh, really?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.043
             Mmmhmm.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.611
   And the other reasons are?

15:13.713 --> 15:18.249
         ( phone rings )

15:18.318 --> 15:19.517
           My mother.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.885
          Your mother?

15:20.954 --> 15:23.021
  Yeah, they wanted to come out
  but I'm working Christmas Day

15:23.123 --> 15:27.025
 and I thought we were spending
    Christmas Eve with Sadie.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.327
   Look, just because I don't
           have Sadie

15:29.396 --> 15:31.329
     doesn't mean our plans
         should change.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.430
               Ok.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.132
               Ok.

15:34.200 --> 15:34.866
              Hey.

15:34.968 --> 15:35.934
              Hmm?

15:36.036 --> 15:37.068
  What did you get your parents
         for Christmas?

15:37.170 --> 15:38.703
        Oh, a gift card.

15:38.805 --> 15:39.637
             Jenny.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.638
              What?

15:40.740 --> 15:42.807
  Oh, that is such a Christmas
            cop-out.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.676
              How?

15:44.744 --> 15:46.311
 Text her right now and ask her
         what she wants.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.445
             No way.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.413
   She can buy what she wants
       with the gift card.

15:48.515 --> 15:49.147
              Nope.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.915
            I will...

15:51.017 --> 15:51.549
        That's my phone.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.817
    What are- woah, come on.

15:52.919 --> 15:53.785
          Dun dun dun.

15:53.887 --> 15:54.419
              Boom.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.687
             There.

15:55.755 --> 15:56.988
       I can't believe you
         just did that.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.323
        Well, believe it.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.257
        ( message alert )

15:59.359 --> 16:01.392
               Oh?

16:01.494 --> 16:02.694
          Ah, you see?

16:02.796 --> 16:03.895
       What does she want?

16:03.997 --> 16:05.563
   I thought you'd never ask.

16:05.665 --> 16:08.900
   We would really like a copy
           of Mary...

16:09.002 --> 16:10.468
              What?

16:10.570 --> 16:13.871
   Mary Hamilton's book signed
 to me and your father, please.

16:13.974 --> 16:15.373
            Perfect.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.542
             Sorry.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.011
 <i> ( radio ) Engine 7, there's a</i>
   <i> 10-35 at Olive and Pierce.</i>

16:20.113 --> 16:21.279
          I better go.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.647
             Jenny!

16:22.749 --> 16:24.415
             Sorry.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.284
     We just got a call from
       a retirement home.

16:26.386 --> 16:27.685
            I heard.

16:27.787 --> 16:28.419
          Hey, Parker.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.153
              Yeah.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.089
            Hey, Tom.

16:31.191 --> 16:35.026
       Uh, yeah, I should-
          I'm gonna go.

16:35.128 --> 16:35.660
              Bye.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.161
               Ok.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.132
           ( exhales )

16:42.569 --> 16:43.868
        I'm gonna ask you
         a few questions

16:43.970 --> 16:45.336
  so just act like we're doing
          the interview

16:45.438 --> 16:47.438
   scheduled for the upcoming
           live show.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.507
              Uh...

16:49.609 --> 16:51.342
         Just answer the
       questions honestly.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.244
            Yeah, ok.

16:56.750 --> 16:58.383
           Not again.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.617
           Hi, Jenny.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.552
        Hi, Mr. Richards.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.021
       He does this every
    Thanksgiving, Christmas,

17:04.124 --> 17:05.256
        all the holidays.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.025
     I think he gets lonely.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.393
     Well, since we're here,

17:08.494 --> 17:09.794
      should we check your
         blood pressure?

17:09.896 --> 17:10.694
               Ok.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.396
               Ok.

17:13.867 --> 17:14.999
           Thank you.

17:15.101 --> 17:16.300
 <i> ( on TV ) I'm Laurie Lawrence.</i>

17:16.403 --> 17:19.404
  Please join me tomorrow night
  on my Christmas Eve special.

17:19.506 --> 17:25.143
    <i> I have the 2002 Olympic</i>
 <i> American hero, Mary Hamilton.</i>

17:25.244 --> 17:27.678
      Mary Hamilton-Norris.

17:27.781 --> 17:28.746
             Right.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.182
    You ever wonder why Mary
      kept Tom's last name?

17:31.284 --> 17:31.983
               Ok.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.017
               Ok.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.452
    Know your place, rookie.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.421
  <i> ( on TV ) So, many of us are</i>
           <i> wondering,</i>

17:36.523 --> 17:39.123
    <i> why did you write a book</i>
          <i> on marriage,</i>

17:39.225 --> 17:41.392
 <i> considering you are divorced?</i>

17:41.494 --> 17:43.561
   What makes you the expert?

17:43.663 --> 17:44.862
     I'd like to hear this.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.130
      I'm just gonna check
         your heartbeat.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.332
   You know, when one reaches
        for Olympic gold

17:48.435 --> 17:49.700
      it starts as a dream.

17:49.803 --> 17:51.803
     Then you wake up at 3am
        every single day

17:51.905 --> 17:53.871
and you practice for five hours.

17:53.973 --> 17:57.041
   You take a lunch break and
practice for another five hours.

17:57.143 --> 17:59.444
      Working on your axel
         and your lutz,

17:59.546 --> 18:01.679
        and when you fall
        you get right up

18:01.781 --> 18:05.149
        and you try again
  and again until it's perfect.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.618
  Mary, that sounds like a lot
   of work for a young child.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.953
          Yes, it was.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.289
  Uh, but that's what it takes.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.625
    So you applied your time
     on the ice to marriage?

18:16.663 --> 18:18.496
   When I realized what I went
        through training

18:18.565 --> 18:21.933
 for the Olympics could also be
   applied to a relationship,

18:22.035 --> 18:24.435
     the lightbulb went off.

18:24.504 --> 18:26.904
       I know the mistakes
         that were made,

18:27.006 --> 18:29.874
  <i> and how Tom and I can change</i>
           <i> for love.</i>

18:29.976 --> 18:31.042
              Tom?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.311
    I didn't give Tom enough
   time to mature sufficiently

18:33.413 --> 18:37.014
 as both a husband and a father
        for our daughter.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.382
       True love prevails.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.784
           True love?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.119
            Jenny...

18:41.221 --> 18:45.756
I love Tom, and deep in my heart
 I know that he still loves me.

18:45.859 --> 18:46.924
             Jenny!

18:47.026 --> 18:49.627
    Tom and I are working on
   things using the techniques

18:49.696 --> 18:51.496
   that I laid out in my book
          to help solve

18:51.598 --> 18:53.331
      our past differences.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.966
     America's sweethearts.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.301
      Back together again.

18:57.403 --> 18:59.303
     Yes, we are, aren't we?

18:59.405 --> 19:00.671
             Jenny!

19:01.741 --> 19:03.007
          I'm so sorry.

19:03.109 --> 19:03.975
         You know what?

19:04.077 --> 19:05.843
       I'm gonna step out
       for some fresh air.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.545
              Yeah.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.914
              Hey.

19:11.751 --> 19:17.221
         ( phone rings )

19:17.323 --> 19:18.956
             Hi mom.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.992
      Yes, I got your text.

19:21.094 --> 19:21.826
         I've been busy.

19:21.928 --> 19:24.662
      Sorry I didn't reply.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.930
  Look, I will work on getting
          you the book

19:26.032 --> 19:28.699
    but no promises, alright?

19:28.801 --> 19:31.869
    Because she's the ex-wife
        of my boyfriend.

19:31.971 --> 19:34.205
       Yeah, that's weird.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.006
         There's a fire.

19:35.108 --> 19:35.806
        Mom, I gotta go.

19:35.909 --> 19:37.275
            Come on!

19:42.081 --> 19:44.582
     I told you not to plug
   into the Christmas lights.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.350
      It's too much power.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.353
       You call yourselves
          professional.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.721
        I'm calling dad.

19:50.823 --> 19:58.896
           ( sirens )

20:00.867 --> 20:08.906
           ( sirens )

20:11.077 --> 20:13.511
     I'm gonna go get ready
   for the Christmas special.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.113
           Good luck.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.048
              Uh...

20:17.150 --> 20:18.349
        Woah, woah, woah.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.650
             No, no!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.085
        Wait, wait, wait!

20:21.154 --> 20:22.653
        Stop! Stop! Stop!

20:23.990 --> 20:25.756
     You're- you'll ruin it!

20:25.858 --> 20:26.924
           Stop! Stop!

20:27.026 --> 20:27.858
           No, no, no!

20:27.961 --> 20:30.328
   Stop! You're gonna ruin it!

20:30.430 --> 20:30.928
               No!

20:31.030 --> 20:31.696
             Sorry?

20:31.798 --> 20:32.930
       What're you doing?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.999
       What're you doing?

20:35.101 --> 20:37.201
       What are you doing?

20:43.710 --> 20:46.043
        Wait 'til I talk
        to Chief Taylor.

20:46.145 --> 20:48.079
      Heads are gonna roll!

20:48.181 --> 20:51.616
         Woah, so cool!

20:51.718 --> 20:53.551
        Let's pack it up.

20:58.391 --> 20:59.190
           Hey, Jenny.

20:59.292 --> 21:00.858
              Hey.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.194
          What's that?

21:03.296 --> 21:05.563
 Oh, that is the pressure gauge.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.269
            The Duke?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.303
          What's that?

21:12.405 --> 21:14.905
        That is the name
          of our truck.

21:15.008 --> 21:18.175
   Couldn't you name the fire
   truck maybe a girl's name?

21:18.278 --> 21:22.346
  Like Missy or Charlotte or...

21:22.448 --> 21:24.649
            Or Sadie?

21:24.751 --> 21:27.084
              Yeah.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.786
          Judge Willis.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.655
        Hi, how are you?

21:30.757 --> 21:31.922
              Good.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.891
         Wanna cool off?

21:38.298 --> 21:39.897
           What's up?

21:41.367 --> 21:43.034
   They act like I don't know.

21:43.136 --> 21:45.403
 Always having secret meetings.

21:45.505 --> 21:48.873
     Why couldn't they just
     figure it out already?

21:48.941 --> 21:53.044
     Well, sometimes adults
      have different views.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.478
       They need somebody
           to mediate.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.946
        Like be the boss?

21:56.049 --> 21:56.714
              Mmm.

21:56.783 --> 21:57.381
          Like a judge.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.883
             Sadie!

22:01.387 --> 22:02.586
           Are you ok?

22:02.689 --> 22:04.288
     It was so cool, daddy.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.590
      I wish you were here
           to see it.

22:09.362 --> 22:10.628
               Oh.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.297
          ( chuckles )

22:13.399 --> 22:16.100
    James has got to be mad.

22:16.202 --> 22:18.502
    Do you want to come watch
         mom talk on TV?

22:18.604 --> 22:19.537
           Yeah, Tom.

22:19.639 --> 22:22.106
    Why don't you go join in
           with Mary?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.910
           Uh, Sadie-

22:26.012 --> 22:28.446
   I know, give you a minute.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.048
      More secret meetings.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.021
              Hey.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.256
     Jenny, what is going on
            with you?

22:39.359 --> 22:40.524
        Oh, come on, Tom.

22:40.626 --> 22:43.427
  Surely you saw the interview.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.730
      Ok, I don't have a TV

22:45.832 --> 22:48.332
 and she would be the last thing
       I'd watch if I did.

22:48.434 --> 22:51.502
  Ok. Well let me fill you in.

22:51.604 --> 22:57.174
  Her Christmas wish is for you
 two to rekindle your true love.

22:57.276 --> 22:58.642
             Jenny.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.711
   Look, if pretending there's
    stuff going on helps her

23:00.813 --> 23:02.747
   sell a few books and gives
    Sadie a nicer Christmas,

23:02.849 --> 23:04.615
           who cares?

23:04.717 --> 23:06.617
             I care.

23:07.854 --> 23:10.221
            Come on.

23:10.323 --> 23:11.088
      Haven't you noticed?

23:11.190 --> 23:13.758
      Mary wears two faces.

23:13.860 --> 23:14.792
            Hi, Tom.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.694
            Hi, Mary.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.630
           Excuse me.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.300
      Eggnog with bourbon.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.068
         Your favourite.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.269
      Do you want a glass?

23:25.371 --> 23:28.906
     I heard you were making
    things up on national TV.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.875
   Come home where you belong.

23:30.977 --> 23:32.276
         I have a home.

23:32.378 --> 23:33.677
         I belong there.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.912
           Thank you.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.480
             So sad.

23:36.582 --> 23:37.715
            Bad dad.

23:37.817 --> 23:42.887
    No presents from you for
 Sadie under the tree this year.

23:42.989 --> 23:46.657
   By the way, you're too old
     for chutes and ladders.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.259
           No, don't!

23:48.361 --> 23:49.827
     She's a national hero.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.495
            Come on.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.131
            What now?

23:54.233 --> 23:56.400
   Don't ever bring this thing
         in here again.

23:56.502 --> 23:59.336
          It's banned.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.372
    You gotta be kidding me.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.373
              Tom.

24:02.475 --> 24:03.474
              What?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.609
       Can you take Sadie
       for a couple hours?

24:05.711 --> 24:06.477
           Yeah, sure.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.446
  Hey, did you know about this?

24:08.548 --> 24:09.613
           My jersey!

24:09.682 --> 24:11.382
  I've been looking everywhere
            for that!

24:11.484 --> 24:13.317
             Thanks.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.686
        Dad, I'm hungry.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.288
           Can we eat?

24:17.356 --> 24:18.456
         Sure, sweetie.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.523
        How about Joe's?

24:19.625 --> 24:21.759
    And can Jenny come, too?

24:21.861 --> 24:22.960

24:25.665 --> 24:27.331
         Sure, why not?

24:27.433 --> 24:28.399
              Yes!

24:29.535 --> 24:30.234
              Yeah.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.035
     I'll just tell Parker.

24:31.137 --> 24:31.802
               Ok.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.671

24:50.523 --> 24:51.322
        We're done here.

24:51.424 --> 24:52.256
               Ok.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.457

25:03.569 --> 25:06.003

          to keep her.

      in the jungle balls?

25:46.679 --> 25:49.847
   That that was your lawyer.

25:49.949 --> 25:50.748
           You think?

25:50.816 --> 25:53.984
       Yeah, she's a kid,
            not deaf.

        for full custody.

          you make it.

26:05.965 --> 26:07.097
     As long as there's love

26:07.199 --> 26:10.734
 there's no reason for the judge
      to take her from you.

26:10.836 --> 26:14.538

              Tom.

            do this?

27:43.562 --> 27:46.130

            then no.

     Lawrence show tomorrow,

          who it hurts.

     else and I knew better

30:22.555 --> 30:24.354
       than to open any of
         those presents.

30:24.456 --> 30:29.293

     every single candy cane

     and I thought for sure

30:45.211 --> 30:48.078
 I was gonna get a good licking.

30:48.180 --> 30:51.181
    But he just cleaned me up
      and he just laughed.

30:53.285 --> 30:59.256

   and I never saw him again.

          No. No, sir.

31:13.906 --> 31:15.105
   I waited at that front door
            for weeks

   expecting him to come back.

31:18.077 --> 31:21.278

31:21.380 --> 31:24.181
    I never want that again.

31:24.283 --> 31:28.018
  So if he feels bad about that
           then good.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.489

        It's ok. It's ok.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.604
             Thanks.

32:20.706 --> 32:22.506
           Thank you.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.141
            So much.

32:25.878 --> 32:28.478
    Tom. How's the toy store?

32:28.580 --> 32:29.613
         Well, actually-

32:29.715 --> 32:32.115
       Sell something real
  and you might make a living.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.750
       Toys are for kids.

32:33.819 --> 32:35.252
    Like Sadie, for instance.

32:35.354 --> 32:36.920
     Alright, you know what?

32:37.022 --> 32:38.922
This hockey stuff needs to stop.

32:38.991 --> 32:39.723
      You know what, James?

32:39.825 --> 32:40.791
          Forgive her.

32:40.893 --> 32:42.559
    If she enjoys both hockey
       and figure skating.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.261
       I mean, look at who
        her parents are.

32:44.330 --> 32:46.096
 Don't you go wasting your money
         on hockey gear.

32:46.198 --> 32:48.732
     It will not be allowed
           in my home.

32:48.834 --> 32:51.268
     I bought her a new set
        of custom skates.

32:51.370 --> 32:54.071
  Even took a mould of her feet
        while she slept.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.205
          You did what?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.441
   Dad, Sadie wants a tablet.

32:57.543 --> 32:59.576
  Yeah, and you wanted a Polly
     Dolly instead of skates

32:59.645 --> 33:01.611
       but I know better.

33:01.714 --> 33:03.714
  I was heartbroken when I got
          those skates

33:03.816 --> 33:05.582
    instead of a Polly Dolly.

33:05.684 --> 33:09.386
    Those skates took you to
   Nationals and then Worlds.

33:09.488 --> 33:11.421
    Sometimes kids don't know
      what's good for them.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.689
           And Sadie-

33:12.791 --> 33:15.659
  Sadie has a pretty good idea
   of what's good for her, ok?

33:15.761 --> 33:18.562
   And I think she can choose
          for herself.

33:18.664 --> 33:19.830
       It's getting late.

33:19.932 --> 33:21.965
It's time to call it an evening.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.834
              Yeah.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.570
         Come on, honey.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.540
  Do you really think Mary has
      a chance in the world

33:30.642 --> 33:33.009
    of taking Sadie from you?

33:33.112 --> 33:34.811
   I wouldn't put it past her.

33:34.913 --> 33:38.782
    There's a lot of factors
            at work.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.817
    And where do I factor in?

33:40.919 --> 33:43.186
         College friend.

33:43.288 --> 33:46.957
    Honestly, I'd just prefer
     to keep you out of it.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.959
   I want to hear you say it.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.596
            Say what?

33:52.698 --> 33:55.532
    That we're more than just
      a Friday night movie.

33:55.634 --> 33:56.600
    Or a lunch at the bistro.

33:56.702 --> 34:00.303
   Or... or a convenient hand
            to hold.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.471
    I want you to say we're-

34:01.573 --> 34:05.709
     Mary, she's made things
   really complicated for us.

34:05.811 --> 34:08.344
    And I worry about Sadie.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.880
              Look.

34:10.983 --> 34:15.952
  What we have is very special
           to me, ok?

34:16.054 --> 34:18.722
     I just don't want Mary
           to ruin it.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.190
     Well, I'm telling you,

34:20.292 --> 34:23.493
 going along with her lies will.

34:23.594 --> 34:27.097
       Ok. You know what?

34:27.199 --> 34:28.899
          You're right.

34:29.001 --> 34:33.003
       Tomorrow I will set
    Mary straight, I promise.

34:33.105 --> 34:37.741
 If you don't, I don't know how
    seriously I can take us.

34:37.842 --> 34:40.577
      I uh... I mean, yes.

34:40.679 --> 34:42.612
           Of course.

34:42.714 --> 34:44.681
               Ok?

34:44.783 --> 34:46.650
               Ok.

     Is everything alright?

36:25.851 --> 36:27.717

  Retired captain at the Fourth
   Street station in Phoenix.

36:37.563 --> 36:41.398
      You're Parker's dad.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.433
   He doesn't want me around.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.570
          I should go.

36:46.638 --> 36:48.805
       It's not too late.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.373
   I believed that last year,

36:50.475 --> 36:52.709
      when I first reached
         out to Parker.

36:52.811 --> 36:57.113
    But now I'm not so sure.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.882
        He told me a bit
         about you two.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.452
        How you left him
        when he was five.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.922
     His mother and I split.

37:06.024 --> 37:08.725
    I was devastated. Angry.

37:08.827 --> 37:12.996
  I walked out and didn't ever
       want to look back.

37:13.065 --> 37:14.531
   I got remarried and my new
         wife made sure

37:14.633 --> 37:17.467
   I cut all ties with my ex.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.336
       I moved to Phoenix.

37:19.438 --> 37:22.906
       Days became months,
      months became years.

37:23.008 --> 37:26.943
And 20 years later here I stand,

37:27.045 --> 37:29.613
  realizing I made the biggest
       mistake of my life

37:29.715 --> 37:32.782
   not fighting to see my son.

37:32.884 --> 37:36.052
    I just called him, but he
 threatened a restraining order

37:36.154 --> 37:41.658
  if I didn't leave him alone.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.793
          I wrote this.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.795
     It explains everything.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.398
   I mailed it to him five or
  six times but he sent it back

37:48.500 --> 37:52.435
      every time, unopened.

37:52.537 --> 37:56.640
   I thought perhaps if I gave
      it to him in person,

37:56.742 --> 37:59.175
    maybe then he'll read it.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.711
   Why don't you give me that?

        gonna go your way

    if you don't play along.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.415
     Well then we both lose,
            don't we?

39:12.517 --> 39:14.584

            you lose.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.920

        be placating her.

          Oh, raining.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.103
  Hey, this call's ten dollars
 a minute but I had to tell you

42:54.205 --> 42:56.906
     <i> we had a huge pre-sale</i>
<i>on your book come in yesterday.</i>

42:57.008 --> 42:58.541
  Really? What does that mean?

42:58.643 --> 43:00.710
    That means you are just a
     few thousand books away

43:00.812 --> 43:03.246
   from being a New York Times
           bestseller!

43:03.348 --> 43:04.948
          What? Really?

43:05.050 --> 43:07.650
       This is so amazing!

43:07.752 --> 43:11.487
    Wow. I thought I'd get it
   on the list must be short.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.823
      I got a call to make.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.758
      Such a party pooper.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.827
     Mary, do you have a man
      for the show tonight?

43:17.929 --> 43:19.329
 <i> Yeah, yeah. Tom will be here.</i>

43:19.431 --> 43:19.929
              Good.

43:20.031 --> 43:21.064
       Get him on your arm

43:21.166 --> 43:23.166
    and you will be the next
   New York Times bestseller!

43:23.268 --> 43:24.100
            ( gasps )

43:24.202 --> 43:25.068
         Catch ya later!

43:25.170 --> 43:25.835
           Good luck!

43:25.937 --> 43:27.804
            Rob? Rob!

43:27.906 --> 43:30.206
            Ugh. Ok.

43:34.279 --> 43:35.311
            Morning.

43:35.413 --> 43:35.979
            Wow, mom.

43:36.081 --> 43:36.980
              That-

43:37.082 --> 43:39.515
      No, not one more word
       or you're gonna be

43:39.617 --> 43:41.851
    on Santa's naughty list.

43:41.953 --> 43:44.387
         Go get dressed.

43:53.198 --> 43:56.299
  ( sing-songy phone ringing )

43:56.401 --> 44:00.036
            Oh jeez.

44:00.138 --> 44:00.636
             Hello?

44:00.739 --> 44:01.371
       Hey, where are you?

44:01.473 --> 44:03.206
      We're gonna be late.

44:03.308 --> 44:04.140
   <i> Yeah, you know what Mary?</i>

44:04.242 --> 44:05.475
       I thought about it.

44:05.577 --> 44:07.210
     If you wanna go to war,
           I'm ready.

44:07.312 --> 44:08.845
  <i> I don't have to play along.</i>

44:08.947 --> 44:10.646
   I will drop my presents off
    and spend next Christmas

44:10.749 --> 44:12.715
with Sadie as per our agreement.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.584
    I won't take your gifts.

44:14.686 --> 44:17.253
   Mary, there's one that she
     really needs next week.

44:17.355 --> 44:20.156
   I'll make sure she doesn't
    see them until next year.

44:20.258 --> 44:22.692
        That's... you're
       being unreasonable!

44:22.794 --> 44:24.027
       That's how I play,

44:24.129 --> 44:27.196
so you better be here in an hour
  or there's nothing for Sadie.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.798
            Ok, fine.

44:28.900 --> 44:30.800
        For Sadie's sake.

44:30.902 --> 44:31.901
      But no book signing.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.569
     I will be at the photo
       and the interview.

44:33.671 --> 44:34.470
           That's it.

44:34.572 --> 44:37.874
  You better be there, or else.

44:37.976 --> 44:46.015
           ( sobbing )

44:54.092 --> 44:57.927
          There you go.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.763
        It's been an hour
      and only two people.

45:00.865 --> 45:02.598
        I'm calling Rob.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.667
    You should be visualizing
      your skating routine,

45:04.769 --> 45:06.569
       not playing games.

45:06.671 --> 45:09.005
            Ok. Done.

45:09.107 --> 45:10.940
  It's a three minute routine.

45:11.042 --> 45:12.608
       I already know it.

45:12.711 --> 45:15.812
   There's knowing it and then
       there's living it.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.413
          Dad, enough!

45:17.515 --> 45:19.949
       Alright, I am here.

45:20.051 --> 45:21.751
         Let's do this.

45:21.853 --> 45:22.819
              Dad!

45:22.921 --> 45:24.587
 Do you guys need to be filming
          all the time?

45:24.689 --> 45:26.389
           Hey, kiddo!

45:28.059 --> 45:30.960
    Aw, so glad to see you're
          here for me.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.261
            Oh, uh..

45:32.363 --> 45:34.097
             uh, ok.

45:34.199 --> 45:37.500
      Now, let's go do our
         family photos.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.569
 Yay, we're going to see Santa!

45:39.671 --> 45:41.003
             Mmmhmm.

45:41.106 --> 45:44.006
  Dad, do you think Santa will
    get me the hockey skates

45:44.109 --> 45:45.007
         that I wanted?

45:45.110 --> 45:46.509
        Sadie, you're the
         proud daughter

45:46.611 --> 45:49.212
   of an Olympic gold medalist
         figure skater.

45:49.314 --> 45:51.848
 Hockey only earned your country
            a silver.

45:51.950 --> 45:53.750
  Who wants to be second best?

45:53.852 --> 45:54.984
     You know what, sweetie?

45:55.086 --> 45:56.853
   Ask for what you want, I'm
   sure Santa will listen, ok?

45:56.955 --> 45:59.455
         Oh, over here.

45:59.557 --> 46:01.023
      We have reservations
          for a photo.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.525
      Mary Hamilton-Norris.

46:02.627 --> 46:05.161
     Well, Merry Christmas.

46:05.263 --> 46:06.095
    Just give me ten minutes.

46:06.197 --> 46:08.531
         I'm on a break.

46:08.633 --> 46:11.367
       I have reservations
        already paid for.

46:11.469 --> 46:12.869
    I'm on a tight schedule.

46:12.971 --> 46:16.105
     Look, lady, you'll have
            to wait.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.574
     The photographer and I
           are union.

46:18.676 --> 46:20.143
         A union Santa?

46:20.245 --> 46:22.545
  Are you- are you kidding me?

46:22.614 --> 46:24.947
   Ok, wait, we have a camera
    phone, we could use that.

46:25.016 --> 46:25.715
       Come on everybody.

46:25.817 --> 46:26.682
           No, no, no.

46:26.785 --> 46:29.285
     That is not permitted,
         subsection two.

46:29.387 --> 46:30.820
      I can't believe this.

46:30.922 --> 46:35.224
       Santa will be back
        in a few minutes.

46:35.326 --> 46:36.759
               Ok.

46:40.532 --> 46:41.531
     Hey, can you pull over?

46:41.633 --> 46:43.833
    I need to get something.

46:43.935 --> 46:45.067
        Last minute gift?

46:45.170 --> 46:47.370
      Yeah, for my mother.

46:58.817 --> 46:59.515
   <i> ( Mary ): Come on, Santa.</i>

46:59.617 --> 47:01.350
 <i> Show me the Christmas spirit.</i>

47:01.452 --> 47:03.219
    <i> I'm on a timeline here.</i>

47:03.321 --> 47:05.087
      Are you really buying
        one of her books?

47:05.190 --> 47:06.956
        It's not for me,
      it's for my parents.

47:07.058 --> 47:08.724
       <i> Yeah, you speak to</i>
         <i> Downer Santa.</i>

47:08.827 --> 47:09.659
   <i> Maybe he'll listen to you.</i>

47:09.761 --> 47:11.627
    And now you're stealing?

47:11.729 --> 47:12.795
               No.

47:12.897 --> 47:16.432
        <i> Nice try, Santa.</i>

47:16.534 --> 47:17.667
        <i> Come on, Santa.</i>

47:17.769 --> 47:21.237
       <i> I need to capture</i>
      <i> this festive moment.</i>

47:21.339 --> 47:22.972
         Here. Sign it.

47:23.074 --> 47:24.373
           Wait, what?

47:24.475 --> 47:25.575
         My parents know
         my handwriting.

47:25.677 --> 47:28.644
 Just write "to Tess and Kyle".

47:28.746 --> 47:30.713
        <i> Come on, Santa.</i>

47:30.815 --> 47:31.547
               Ok.

47:31.649 --> 47:33.583
       <i> We need a picture.</i>

47:33.685 --> 47:34.383
       Did you hear that?

47:34.485 --> 47:35.651
        <i> Let's go, Santa.</i>

47:35.753 --> 47:37.053
      <i> Sit on your throne.</i>

47:37.155 --> 47:38.287
        Wait, is that...?

47:38.389 --> 47:39.455
     Yeah, come on, come on!

47:39.557 --> 47:40.423
              Um...

47:40.525 --> 47:41.457
        <i> Let's go, Santa.</i>

47:41.559 --> 47:43.125
         To Tess and...

47:43.228 --> 47:44.961
       <i> Stop ignoring me!</i>

47:45.063 --> 47:46.762
       <i> I need this photo!</i>

47:46.865 --> 47:48.631
           Thank you.

47:48.733 --> 47:50.499
        <i> Come on. Santa?</i>

47:50.602 --> 47:53.102
       What is she doing?

47:53.204 --> 47:54.470
        <i> Hey, look here.</i>

47:54.572 --> 47:56.372
      <i> I have a film crew,</i>
           <i> my family,</i>

47:56.474 --> 47:58.474
 and a New York Times bestseller
         list to get on.

47:58.576 --> 48:00.943
       I need this photo.

48:01.045 --> 48:02.411
              Tom?

48:02.513 --> 48:04.814
    We follow the rules here!

48:04.883 --> 48:07.817
  Now, you'll just have to get
   in line and wait your turn

48:07.919 --> 48:11.053
     just like all the other
   good little girls and boys.

48:11.155 --> 48:12.488
      You can forget that!

48:12.590 --> 48:13.289
        Hey, Mary, Mary.

48:13.391 --> 48:14.090
          Cool it, ok?

48:14.192 --> 48:15.258
          We can wait.

48:15.360 --> 48:15.958
      Oh, God, here we go again.

48:16.060 --> 48:16.893
        Not on your life.

48:16.995 --> 48:17.960
    You're lucky to be here.

48:18.062 --> 48:19.161
       I'm allowing this.

48:19.264 --> 48:20.830
      And if we are in love
    then you will support me

48:20.932 --> 48:22.531
         no matter what!

48:22.600 --> 48:24.000
            In love?

48:24.102 --> 48:27.637
  I need that photo and I need
        it now, fat man!

48:28.740 --> 48:31.374
      Mom called Santa fat.

48:31.476 --> 48:34.810
           ( choking )

48:34.913 --> 48:36.812
        Santa's choking!

48:36.915 --> 48:38.347
            Oh, jeez.

48:38.416 --> 48:40.416
          ( chanting )
     Save Santa! Save Santa!

48:40.518 --> 48:43.286
          ( chanting )
     Save Santa! Save Santa!

48:43.421 --> 48:43.886
     ( chanting continues )

48:43.955 --> 48:45.688
       Hey Tom, Hey Mary.

48:45.790 --> 48:47.556
         Come on, Santa.

48:47.659 --> 48:49.492
       Stay still, Santa.

48:49.594 --> 48:51.727
               Ok.

48:51.796 --> 48:54.530
      Jenny's saving Santa!

48:54.632 --> 48:58.534
          ( cries out )

48:58.636 --> 49:01.170
       ( food dislodges )

49:04.442 --> 49:06.375
              Eww.

49:06.477 --> 49:07.576
        Look, everybody.

49:07.679 --> 49:09.178
       Jenny saved Santa.

49:09.280 --> 49:13.683
          ( cheering )

49:13.785 --> 49:15.418
          He might need
          some oxygen.

49:15.520 --> 49:17.653
         Oh, you need me
          to sign this?

49:17.755 --> 49:18.354
              Yeah.

49:18.456 --> 49:19.355
        It's not for me.

49:19.457 --> 49:22.525
     Uh, can you make it out
        to Kyle and Tess?

49:22.627 --> 49:25.761
  I'll gladly sign it for you.

49:25.863 --> 49:29.465
  Even our town's firefighters
          read my book.

49:36.541 --> 49:39.008
              Hey.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.410
I thought you weren't gonna play
       her games anymore.

49:41.512 --> 49:43.112
   Look, she won't give Sadie
           my presents

49:43.214 --> 49:45.848
    until after the new year.

49:45.950 --> 49:49.952
   It's funny how you believe
   everything that Mary says.

49:50.054 --> 49:51.988
             Jenny.

49:56.761 --> 49:57.526
              Mary.

49:57.628 --> 49:58.394
           Yes, honey?

49:58.496 --> 50:00.062
           We're done.

50:00.164 --> 50:00.963
              Done?

50:01.065 --> 50:01.731
       It's over. Through.

50:01.833 --> 50:02.732
     Never gonna happen, ok?

50:02.834 --> 50:04.934
     I'm calling my lawyer,
       I'm fighting back,

50:05.036 --> 50:06.135
          I'm fighting
        for full custody.

50:06.237 --> 50:07.269
       The war's on, Mary.

50:07.372 --> 50:09.238
         No more games.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.740
     Is that what you want?

50:10.842 --> 50:13.709
       All your gifts gone
            to waste?

50:15.680 --> 50:17.146
       You won't do that.

50:17.248 --> 50:18.280
             Try me.

50:18.383 --> 50:20.249
              Hey!

50:20.351 --> 50:22.151
         What about me?

50:22.253 --> 50:22.985
          You're a kid.

50:23.087 --> 50:24.053
     These are adult issues.

50:24.155 --> 50:26.255
        Stay out of them.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.559
            Sadie...

50:33.231 --> 50:35.131
    Look. I hope you realize
    the mistake you're making

50:35.233 --> 50:36.766
       before Sadie does.

50:36.834 --> 50:39.435
My gifts will be under that tree
tomorrow morning no matter what.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.837
      No, they won't, Tom.

50:41.939 --> 50:43.639
      Stay out of my house.

50:43.741 --> 50:45.474
      Ok, you want to play?

50:45.576 --> 50:46.842
           Let's play.

50:46.944 --> 50:49.111
            Bring it.

50:49.213 --> 50:51.380
 I am sorry you had to see that.

50:51.482 --> 50:53.149
    It's like I'm invisible.

50:53.251 --> 50:54.517
   I can hear them, you know.

50:54.619 --> 50:56.419
             I know.

50:57.588 --> 50:59.355
              Hey.

50:59.457 --> 51:01.290
           Thank you.

51:02.493 --> 51:06.695
      Sadie, I am so sorry.

51:06.798 --> 51:09.031
       There will never be
     another year like this.

51:09.133 --> 51:11.000
            Yeah, ok.

51:11.102 --> 51:14.036
      Hey, Sadie, let's go.

51:14.138 --> 51:15.871
      I'll call you later,
            ok kiddo?

51:15.973 --> 51:17.339
          See you guys.

51:17.442 --> 51:18.674
            Bye, dad.

51:18.776 --> 51:19.475
           Bye, Jenny.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.243
          Bye, sweetie.

51:25.216 --> 51:28.284
      She is going to be so
  heartbroken tomorrow morning.

51:28.386 --> 51:31.087
    No skates under the tree.

51:31.189 --> 51:33.489
    Santa always finds a way.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.161
         I have a plan.

51:40.598 --> 51:41.230
      Where are you going?

51:41.332 --> 51:43.099
    I'll call you later, ok?

51:44.102 --> 51:45.067
      Where are you going?

51:45.169 --> 51:47.536
         To safeguard my
      daughter's Christmas.

52:17.702 --> 52:18.601
      Santa to the rescue.

52:18.703 --> 52:21.837
           Here we go.

52:42.627 --> 52:44.994
           Here we go.

52:46.030 --> 52:48.364
               Ok.

52:52.069 --> 52:53.936
            ( sighs )

52:54.038 --> 52:55.538
       Not gonna stop me.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.806
       Not gonna stop me.

53:09.987 --> 53:13.022
          She is nuts!

53:14.025 --> 53:14.723
             Ok, ok.

53:14.825 --> 53:15.824
           Here we go.

53:15.927 --> 53:16.625
         What've we got?

53:16.727 --> 53:19.061
         What've we got?

53:23.334 --> 53:26.602
           Ah, bingo.

53:36.614 --> 53:37.179
          Hey, Parker.

53:37.281 --> 53:38.447
    I have something for you.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.381
       Yeah? What's that?

53:39.483 --> 53:42.084
         From your dad.

53:43.087 --> 53:44.420
     Oh, you talked to him?

53:44.522 --> 53:45.955
              Yeah.

53:46.057 --> 53:48.457
  Parker, you need to give him
            a chance.

53:50.628 --> 53:52.261
          Send it back.

53:52.363 --> 53:53.829
   He regrets what he's done.

53:53.931 --> 53:54.964
  You know what? I don't care!

53:55.066 --> 53:56.131
      He was a firefighter,
             Parker.

53:56.234 --> 54:00.269
         Just like you.

54:00.371 --> 54:07.042
  One day you're going to want
       to know the truth.

54:07.144 --> 54:10.746
 Maybe that truth will heal all
 the pain that's inside of you.

54:13.484 --> 54:16.585
  Why not make that day today?

54:37.842 --> 54:39.008
           "Dear son,

54:39.110 --> 54:41.510
    "I wish I could take back
   the years I lost with you,

54:41.612 --> 54:43.012
          "but I can't.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.480
"It's one of my greatest regrets

54:44.582 --> 54:46.915
"and I hope you will forgive me.

54:47.018 --> 54:49.051
   I have always loved you and
      there's not a moment

54:49.153 --> 54:51.553
 "that I don't think about you.

54:51.656 --> 54:54.923
  "The birthdays I missed, your
   graduation, your marriage.

54:55.026 --> 54:58.260
    "I can never change that,
             Parker.

54:58.362 --> 55:04.133
        "But I can change
     what happens tomorrow.

55:04.235 --> 55:08.737
    "I need- no, I want to be
          a better dad.

55:08.806 --> 55:10.706
      "The dad you deserve.

55:10.808 --> 55:13.008
      "I love you, Parker.

55:13.110 --> 55:15.377
           "Your dad."

55:15.479 --> 55:22.918
           ( sobbing )

55:23.020 --> 55:26.055
          Dad... dad...

55:27.425 --> 55:29.525
       ( clinking glass )

55:29.627 --> 55:31.727
       Everyone. Everyone.

55:31.829 --> 55:33.862
      I have amazing news.

55:33.964 --> 55:36.231
      I just heard from my
      daughter's publisher

55:36.334 --> 55:38.133
 that her book has made it onto

55:38.202 --> 55:42.037
       the New York Times
        bestseller list!

55:42.139 --> 55:43.906
          ( applause )

55:44.008 --> 55:45.607
      Who did you talk to?

55:45.710 --> 55:47.042
        Rob's assistant.

55:47.144 --> 55:49.011
        You're a success.

55:49.080 --> 55:51.880
     Hardly anyone showed up
      for my book signing.

55:51.982 --> 55:54.016
      And you choked Santa.

55:54.118 --> 55:55.751
      You were lucky Jenny
           was there.

55:55.853 --> 55:57.219
         Yeah, lucky me.

55:57.321 --> 56:00.456
    Now, back to the New York
        Times bestseller.

56:00.558 --> 56:04.827
       A toast to my Mary.

56:04.929 --> 56:06.895
   I know you can do anything.

56:06.997 --> 56:10.899
 You are still my little winner.

56:23.247 --> 56:25.681
               Ok.

56:34.925 --> 56:39.461
        ( out of breath )

56:39.563 --> 56:41.897
               Ok.

56:46.537 --> 56:48.270
           Here we go.

56:48.372 --> 56:53.776
           Oh, oh, oh.

56:53.878 --> 56:55.210
            Careful.

56:55.312 --> 56:56.512
             Focus.

56:56.614 --> 56:59.381
         Aaaah, oh, oh.

56:59.483 --> 57:00.949
      Whew, that is a long
           ways down.

57:01.051 --> 57:03.252
           Here we go.

57:04.321 --> 57:07.356
               Ok.

57:07.458 --> 57:10.926
      To think, Santa does
      this every Christmas.

57:11.028 --> 57:14.797
      Well, the things I do
         for you, Sadie.

57:14.899 --> 57:17.733
          ( grunting )

57:26.911 --> 57:30.078
             Ahhh!!!

57:31.615 --> 57:33.115
             Ohhh!!!

57:36.086 --> 57:37.686
               Ok.

57:37.788 --> 57:39.087
               Ok.

57:40.624 --> 57:44.393
         I am... stuck.

57:52.937 --> 57:55.704
   I believe that's Tom's car.

57:55.806 --> 57:56.805
            Awesome!

57:56.874 --> 58:00.375
      Is daddy coming over
         for Christmas?

58:00.478 --> 58:04.112
       I think your daddy
         might be lost.

58:06.984 --> 58:09.151
        <i> Dad! Slow down!</i>

58:09.253 --> 58:10.652
        <i> Faster, grandpa!</i>

58:10.754 --> 58:13.589
          <i> Do it again!</i>

58:13.691 --> 58:15.591
          Ride's over.

58:28.272 --> 58:30.038
           Tom Norris?

58:30.140 --> 58:31.206
              Huh?

58:31.342 --> 58:33.909
    You better not be in here
   or I'm calling the police.

58:34.011 --> 58:36.378
You'll be spending Christmas Eve
         in the slammer.

58:36.480 --> 58:38.280
   I told you he wasn't here.

58:38.382 --> 58:39.715
    ( sing-songy phone ring )

58:39.817 --> 58:41.917
            Ugh. No.

58:42.019 --> 58:46.088
    ( sing-songy phone ring )

58:46.190 --> 58:48.957
       ( phone vibrating )

58:49.059 --> 58:51.793
      Hey, Tom, we're just
    pulling into the station.

58:51.896 --> 58:53.295
  It took a little longer than
           I expected

58:53.397 --> 58:54.696
  so I'm gonna be late tonight.

58:54.798 --> 58:58.567
          Jenny! Jenny!

58:58.669 --> 59:01.236
        Oh, frankincense.

59:01.338 --> 59:03.639
              Shh!

59:03.741 --> 59:05.240
           He's here.

59:05.342 --> 59:06.942
     Sadie, you go upstairs
           and check.

59:07.044 --> 59:07.943
      I'm gonna go outside.

59:08.045 --> 59:09.745
          Ok, grandpa.

59:09.847 --> 59:12.014
      ( struggling grunts )

59:12.116 --> 59:13.582
        ( phone ringing )

59:13.684 --> 59:14.550
              Yeah?

59:14.652 --> 59:16.685
     Mary, I just got a call
        from the "Times"

59:16.754 --> 59:19.087
       and they're pulling
        you off the list.

59:19.156 --> 59:20.923
           What? Why?

59:21.025 --> 59:22.925
       Your father bought
         all the books.

59:23.027 --> 59:24.426
             What?!

59:24.528 --> 59:26.428
   <i> James bought all the books</i>
    <i> from the first printing.</i>

59:26.530 --> 59:28.363
     <i> It must have cost him</i>
           <i> a fortune.</i>

59:28.465 --> 59:31.233
     Oh, wait just a second.

59:35.606 --> 59:38.240
      I can't believe him!

59:38.342 --> 59:41.710
      Why would he do that?

59:41.812 --> 59:42.844
      I'm gonna put a hold
          on the order

59:42.913 --> 59:44.279
   and the Times has given me
          until Monday

59:44.381 --> 59:47.249
     to sort this thing out
   before they break the news.

59:47.351 --> 59:50.018
           <i> Gotta go.</i>

59:50.120 --> 59:51.320
     The news crew is here.

59:51.388 --> 59:54.089
  Laurie, her plane flight was
   delayed due to bad weather.

59:54.191 --> 59:55.757
        They wanna light
         the fireplace.

59:55.859 --> 59:57.159
              What?

59:57.261 --> 59:58.260
      I told them the flue
           was broken

59:58.362 --> 01:00:00.729
      so they opted for the
         Christmas tree.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:01.797
             <i> Fine.</i>

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:04.232
         Oh, thank you.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:07.536
 <i> So... can we expect Tom soon?</i>

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:10.172
         Tom is delayed.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.341
   Well, we're just gonna have
      to start without him.

01:00:12.409 --> 01:00:14.376
     Dad, why don't you come
          and sit here?

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:15.410
          Yes, please.

01:00:15.512 --> 01:00:18.780
       Um, just finals and
     then we're ready to go.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:35.964
             Thanks.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:46.541
 Welcome to the Laurie Lawrence
              show.

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.677
       Today I have a very
         special guest.

01:00:48.746 --> 01:00:51.079
      Mary Hamilton-Norris
      here with her family

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:54.082
 to read to us "The Night Before
           Christmas".

01:00:54.184 --> 01:00:56.952
            Perfect.

01:00:57.021 --> 01:00:59.154

        before Christmas

        not even a mouse.

       ( dirt crumbling )

 Sounds like the mice didn't get
          the message.

   "When out on the lawn, came
       such a clatter..."

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:03.251
   I rose from the bed to see
      what was the matter.

   <i> ( on TV ) Who's up there?</i>

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:08.123
  Let's just go to commercial.

       ( phone vibrating )

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.362
             Oh no.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.834
      Hi, Tom. It's Jenny.

01:02:18.936 --> 01:02:20.135
            I'm here.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.603
         Where are you?

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:23.872
         I will give you
       that car for free.

01:02:23.941 --> 01:02:26.208
     Yesiree, you heard me.

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.342
             Great.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:29.177
    My deals are solid gold.

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.548
           Hello, Tom.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.619
       Ho, ho, ho, James.

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:39.621
            It's Tom.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.656
      He's in my fireplace.

01:02:41.759 --> 01:02:42.758
             Daddy!

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.792
           Stand back!

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:44.526
           He's busy.

01:02:44.595 --> 01:02:46.628
           It's messy.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.663
   We just need to re-schedule
         this interview.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:50.832
      I will have my office
          contact you.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.267
           Uh, Laurie.

01:02:52.369 --> 01:02:53.869
      Hey. What's going on?

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:55.203
     We- we should continue.

01:02:55.272 --> 01:02:56.304
            No, Mary.

01:02:56.406 --> 01:02:58.540
      With your ex-husband
         in the chimney?

01:02:58.609 --> 01:03:00.909
  We can intro Tom coming from
  the chimney for the special-

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:01.877
              Mary.

01:03:01.979 --> 01:03:03.812
     Can I give you a piece
           of advice?

01:03:03.914 --> 01:03:06.214
     I've interviewed a lot
         of celebrities.

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:08.817
 The ones that seem to be doing
  the very best in their lives

01:03:08.886 --> 01:03:10.552
       were those who were
          independent.

01:03:10.654 --> 01:03:12.154
      They stopped chasing
        something bigger

01:03:12.256 --> 01:03:14.923
       and they were happy
       with who they were.

01:03:15.025 --> 01:03:17.659
   You can't please everyone.

01:03:17.761 --> 01:03:23.465
    Maybe it's just time that
  you try to just be yourself.

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:25.367
        You can do this.

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:26.501
         I know you can.

01:03:26.603 --> 01:03:29.337
        Merry Christmas.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:42.384
         May I join you?

01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:45.687
         Hey. Of course.

01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:47.622
      I want to thank you.

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.858
      I need to apologize.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.593
       Parker can be quite
     hard-headed sometimes-

01:03:51.695 --> 01:03:53.228
      I'm meeting him here
        in five minutes.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:55.096
        He wants to talk.

01:03:55.199 --> 01:03:56.565
             Really?

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:58.266
     Probably gonna give me
       a restraining order

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:02.470
      but at least I'll get
           to see him.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:05.273
     I hope things work out
          for you two.

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.075
           Thank you.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.144
       Can I grab a beer?

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.779
             Daddy?

01:04:10.881 --> 01:04:13.114
        Hey, sweetheart.

01:04:13.217 --> 01:04:15.584
      What're you doing up
         in the chimney?

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.319
       I can't really say.

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:18.320
    Just don't look up here,
               ok?

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:21.456
 The falling dust is really bad.

01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:22.858
         He needs help.

01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.226
         I'll help him.

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:25.760
          No, grandpa!

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:28.630
        Just a few whacks
       and he'll be loose.

01:04:28.732 --> 01:04:29.931
            Come on.

01:04:30.033 --> 01:04:31.233
            Open up.

01:04:31.335 --> 01:04:32.934
         This is stuck.

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:34.970
        I'm calling 911.

01:04:35.072 --> 01:04:37.539
       ( clanging sounds )

01:04:38.842 --> 01:04:40.942
     Hello, my name is Sadie
    and I need Jenny Jenkins

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.277
      to come to my house.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:44.312
  <i> ( Operator ): Ok, what seems</i>
       <i> to be the problem?</i>

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:45.881
        My daddy is stuck
         in the chimney.

01:04:45.983 --> 01:04:46.748
     <i> Stuck in the chimney?</i>

01:04:46.850 --> 01:04:47.515
             Mmmhmm.

01:04:47.618 --> 01:04:48.149
  <i> Let's get him out of there.</i>

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:48.950
           Thank you.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.052
             Mmmhmm.

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:54.155
    Relationships are tricky.

01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:54.890
           Hey, Jenny.

01:04:54.992 --> 01:04:56.258
          Hey, Parker.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.425
        ( phone ringing )

01:04:57.527 --> 01:04:59.060
              Dad.

01:04:59.162 --> 01:05:02.264
        ( phone ringing )

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:02.931
           I got this.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.100
     You stay with your dad.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.069
     You sure you don't have
             to go?

01:05:08.171 --> 01:05:10.805
       No, I'm uh, I'm off
           the clock.

01:05:10.908 --> 01:05:13.174
  Can I get that beer, please?

01:05:13.277 --> 01:05:14.809
           Thank you.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:23.518
     Look, I talked to mom.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.587
     Just tell me one thing.

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:27.389
      Why didn't you call?

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.858
         Or come visit?

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:32.060
  I waited every day so I could
         hear your voice

01:05:32.162 --> 01:05:37.532
     or see your face again.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:38.867
    I was afraid of what you
           might say.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:41.503
    Does that really matter?

01:05:41.605 --> 01:05:44.606
      Of course I was mad!

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:49.277
 Of course I wanted to hate you.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:53.515
          But I can't.

01:05:53.617 --> 01:05:58.486
        I loved you, dad.

01:05:58.588 --> 01:05:59.587
          I missed you,

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:03.925
   and all I wanted was to be
      a part of your life.

01:06:04.027 --> 01:06:05.827
  I wanted to hear your voice,

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:08.697
   even for one brief moment.

01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:17.639
           I'm sorry.

01:06:17.741 --> 01:06:20.175
     Parker, I am so sorry.

01:06:20.277 --> 01:06:26.982
           ( sobbing )

01:06:27.084 --> 01:06:30.885
        Um... mom told me
     about the entire thing

01:06:30.988 --> 01:06:32.554
     I'm so sorry I didn't-

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:37.359
    Parker, that's long done.

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:44.432
     We don't need to rehash
            all that.

01:06:44.534 --> 01:06:50.839
  I saw a photo of your family
        on the internet.

01:06:50.941 --> 01:06:55.176
        They look great.

01:06:55.278 --> 01:06:59.247
        You're a grandpa.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.617
            Grandpa.

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:03.685
          I like that.

01:07:03.787 --> 01:07:05.553
     I like that a lot, man.

01:07:05.655 --> 01:07:07.422
      It's good to see you.

01:07:07.524 --> 01:07:09.958
       I missed you, dad.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.941
            Open up!

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:29.811
           ( banging )

01:07:29.913 --> 01:07:32.280
            Oh, man.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:40.288
         ( struggling )

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:42.257
              Whew!

01:07:49.266 --> 01:07:51.266
              Tom?

01:07:51.368 --> 01:07:52.133
             Jenny!

01:07:52.235 --> 01:07:54.069
       What are you doing?

01:07:54.171 --> 01:07:56.237
   Oh, thank god you're here.

01:07:56.339 --> 01:07:57.338
         We had a date.

01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:01.142
     Yeah, I'm running just
         a little late.

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.377
    Holiday traffic and all,
            you know.

01:08:02.479 --> 01:08:03.344
           Ho, ho, ho.

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:04.112
           ( laughs )

01:08:04.214 --> 01:08:05.513
           Not funny.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.482
         What was wrong
         with the door?

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:08.917
         It was locked.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.485
           Hey, look.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.887
    I'm doing this for Sadie.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:13.855
               No.

01:08:13.957 --> 01:08:15.256
         No, you're not.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:16.658
   You're doing this for you,

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:20.228
   and what you're doing I can
     no longer be a part of.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.029
       I know, I'm stupid.

01:08:22.131 --> 01:08:23.965
              Look,

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:27.635
    can we just get me out of
 here and then talk about this?

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:30.205
        Yeah. Yeah, sure.

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:32.807
              Here.

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.944
    Stretch a little further?

01:08:36.046 --> 01:08:36.743
            Come on.

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:38.479
           Unstuck...

01:08:38.582 --> 01:08:41.316
          ( grumbling )

01:08:41.384 --> 01:08:42.951
            Stretch.

01:08:43.053 --> 01:08:43.651
             Almost.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:44.319
            Come on.

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:45.053
       Just a bit further.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:45.854
         You can do it.

01:08:45.956 --> 01:08:47.221
      <i> I know I can do it.</i>

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.189
          We got this.

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:49.524
   <i> You're right we got this.</i>

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.593
        Come on. Come on.

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:52.594
              Tom.

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:54.028
          ( grunting )

01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:55.395
      No, don't pull me in!

01:08:55.499 --> 01:09:02.670
         ( crying out )
    Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

01:09:02.772 --> 01:09:06.707
           ( gasping )

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.676
          Daddy! Jenny!

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:09.477
              Yes!

01:09:09.578 --> 01:09:11.912
     I knew she'd save you.

01:09:12.015 --> 01:09:13.648
               Hi.

01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:20.354
  Jenny, do you wanna stay for
  the first Christmas present?

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:23.858
       We always open one
           before bed.

01:09:23.926 --> 01:09:27.194
    Sadie, honey, can I talk
    to your dad for a moment?

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.298
      More secret meetings.

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:37.939
              Hey.

01:09:38.041 --> 01:09:40.408
  I am so sorry about all this.

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:43.111
              Tom.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.647
            Jenny...

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:53.254
     You ruined everything.

01:09:55.825 --> 01:09:57.959
              Hey.

01:09:58.061 --> 01:09:59.994
              Tom.

01:10:00.096 --> 01:10:03.464
  I need to break up with you.

01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:04.299
            All this?

01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:05.934
It's way more than I can handle.

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:06.968
      No, Jenny, please. I-

01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:08.269
       No, the games, Tom.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:11.406
   You're still playing them.

01:10:11.508 --> 01:10:14.742
I can no longer be a part of it.

01:10:14.844 --> 01:10:18.446
         It is over, ok?

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:22.350
       You got that right.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.719
            Jenny...

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:27.522
             Jenny.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.561
            ( sighs )

01:10:33.663 --> 01:10:35.763
         Christmas Eve.

01:11:07.697 --> 01:11:10.865
          What is this?

01:11:10.967 --> 01:11:11.666
              Put.

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:12.634
              That.

01:11:12.736 --> 01:11:14.636
              Down.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:19.207
       I will not allow my
granddaughter to play boy sports

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:22.977
    when she has the natural
 ability to be something great.

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:26.648
    She will not play hockey
            anymore!

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.883
      You are unbelievable.

01:11:28.985 --> 01:11:30.218
   She is your granddaughter!

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:33.254
  Yeah, who will follow in her
  superstar mother's footsteps

01:11:33.356 --> 01:11:35.556
    but without the mistakes.

01:11:35.659 --> 01:11:37.792
       Like marrying you.

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:39.961
          Look at you.

01:11:40.063 --> 01:11:42.196
         You were never
        in Mary's league.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:44.932
         Sadie deserves
         so much better.

01:11:45.035 --> 01:11:46.234
           Oh, really?

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:47.268
           Oh, really?

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.536
      Can any of us live up
       to James Hamilton's

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:50.038
     out-of-reach standards?

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:52.340
             <i> Stop!</i>

01:11:52.442 --> 01:11:55.710
     You're always fighting
   and having secret meetings!

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:58.179
         I can hear you!

01:12:00.116 --> 01:12:01.282
     I wish I could just be
           like Jenny

01:12:01.384 --> 01:12:03.751
  and break-up with all of you.

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:06.087
             Sadie!

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:12.694
             Sadie.

01:12:12.796 --> 01:12:15.296
      Tom, you caused this.

01:12:15.398 --> 01:12:16.664
       Get back down here!

01:12:16.766 --> 01:12:19.200
          James! Stop!

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:22.203
        What did you say?

01:12:22.305 --> 01:12:24.372
   You're done controlling me.

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:25.773
     You took Christmas away
             from me

01:12:25.875 --> 01:12:27.675
         too many times
     when I was a young kid

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.845
      and you're not gonna
        do this anymore.

01:12:30.947 --> 01:12:36.484
  If my daughter wants a tablet
       or to play hockey,

01:12:36.586 --> 01:12:37.585
            she can.

01:12:37.687 --> 01:12:40.588
 You're not turning her into me.

01:12:40.690 --> 01:12:43.057
         A- a champion?

01:12:43.159 --> 01:12:47.462
 Do you even remember my eighth
        grade Christmas?

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:51.332
      You made me practice
    at 7am and work all day.

01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:53.835
    I didn't even get to open
       my Christmas gifts

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.770
      until the next week.

01:12:55.839 --> 01:13:00.408
  All that pounding in my head
 of winning and look at me now.

01:13:00.510 --> 01:13:02.977
 I'm still living in your house.

01:13:03.079 --> 01:13:05.480
    I'm practically broke and
     the book that I wrote,

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.582
     you cheated the sales.

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:13.454
        And my daughter,
          she hates me.

01:13:13.556 --> 01:13:16.991
       I'm a bitter woman,

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.862
     and Sadie is not gonna
         turn into that.

01:13:20.964 --> 01:13:24.632
       You made me proud.

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:29.137
  I'm a trophy on your mantle.

01:13:29.239 --> 01:13:31.172
     A gold medal in a box.

01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:33.007
    You should have given me

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:38.513
      a Polly Dolly instead
        of those skates.

01:13:38.615 --> 01:13:41.682
   You're done controlling me.

01:13:41.785 --> 01:13:44.352
    I'm moving out tomorrow.

01:13:44.454 --> 01:13:47.755
I'm going to start my life over.

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:53.995
        I- I didn't know
       you felt that way.

01:13:54.063 --> 01:13:56.230
        And those books,
    they're for my customers.

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:59.233
       You made it worse.

01:13:59.302 --> 01:14:02.904
    The New York Times knows
         that it was you

01:14:03.006 --> 01:14:05.640
       and now they think
        that I'm a cheat.

01:14:05.742 --> 01:14:07.809
     You're a winner, Mary.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:10.378
    I want you to always have
            the best.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:14.215
      And I want you to be
          a grandfather

01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:17.452
        and a father who
      is supportive of us.

01:14:17.554 --> 01:14:22.323
        Not someone who's
controlling us or the situation.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:28.863
         Mom understood.

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.798
 She was happy no matter the...

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:36.704
     the medal or the trophy
           that I won.

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:39.140
 She was happy just to hold me.

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:41.642
           I miss her.

01:14:44.848 --> 01:14:51.085
     I'm... so sorry, Mary.

01:14:51.187 --> 01:14:54.088
      Please... forgive me.

01:14:54.190 --> 01:14:56.991
           ( sobbing )

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:00.828
           I love you.

01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.964
        I love you, too.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:20.815
I'm really sorry about all this,
           sweetheart.

01:15:20.917 --> 01:15:21.749
            It's ok.

01:15:21.818 --> 01:15:23.117
  Now that the chimney's fixed

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:25.953
   Santa will have no problems
          getting down.

01:15:26.055 --> 01:15:29.090
          ( chuckles )

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:32.293
          That's right.

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:34.862
              Here.

01:15:34.964 --> 01:15:35.963
           Thank you.

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:39.066
  They're really amazing, dad.

01:15:39.168 --> 01:15:41.769
       I love you, honey.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.771
    I have something for you
           and Jenny.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.840
             You do?

01:15:51.381 --> 01:15:53.281
              What?

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:11.532
    Why is grandpa all alone?

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:15.436
           ( laughs )

01:16:15.538 --> 01:16:17.838
       Thank you, sweetie.

01:16:17.941 --> 01:16:21.576
     I love you, sweetheart.

01:16:21.678 --> 01:16:25.313
     I'm gonna go downstairs
    and check on things, ok?

01:16:25.415 --> 01:16:27.515
   I need to say sorry to mom.

01:16:27.617 --> 01:16:30.084
   I didn't mean what I said.

01:16:30.186 --> 01:16:33.487
          Ok. Come on.

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:46.801
         Mom, I'm sorry.

01:16:46.903 --> 01:16:50.237
  Oh, it's ok baby. Come here.

01:16:55.812 --> 01:16:59.380
    Where did you find this?

01:16:59.482 --> 01:17:02.183
         It wasn't easy.

01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.821
     You really love Jenny,
           don't you?

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.525
 Well, love is a two-way street

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:13.194
       and I think we just
         hit a dead end.

01:17:13.262 --> 01:17:14.095
        Oh, come off it.

01:17:14.197 --> 01:17:16.664
      It's because of you.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:19.100
               Me?

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:22.003
    You never stood up to me,
              Tom.

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:25.272
    Even when we were married
       I pushed you around

01:17:25.375 --> 01:17:27.308
         and you let me.

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:31.379
     This time... this time,
        you pushed back.

01:17:31.481 --> 01:17:35.449
     And you got stuck in my
   father's chimney doing it.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:41.622
        That firefighter,
    she's lucky to have you.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:47.194
     You dropped something.

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:54.368
       So if you love her,

01:17:58.241 --> 01:18:00.508
        then go get her.

01:18:06.716 --> 01:18:09.784
         One more thing.

01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:11.152
          What's that?

01:18:11.254 --> 01:18:13.721
       Sadie's rightfully
         yours tonight.

01:18:13.823 --> 01:18:16.290
      And tomorrow morning.

01:18:16.392 --> 01:18:20.461
      But... why do we have
       to spend it apart?

01:18:20.530 --> 01:18:23.798
    Why can't we all spend it
            together?

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:28.736
      We're all one family,
           aren't we?

01:18:28.838 --> 01:18:30.738
          She's right.

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:32.673
     We are still a family,

01:18:32.775 --> 01:18:37.078
  and I realize now that I made
  a lot of mistakes in my life

01:18:37.180 --> 01:18:39.747
       and maybe I pushed
       a little too hard.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:41.315
             Maybe?

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.516
             Ok, ok.

01:18:42.618 --> 01:18:47.188
    So, I pushed too hard and
   I forgot about the details.

01:18:47.256 --> 01:18:51.826
  I forgot about what Christmas
          really meant.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:55.262
  Your mother's favourite time
            of year.

01:18:55.364 --> 01:18:57.732
    And now there's more than
          a few nights

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:02.536
   where I wish I had just one
     more moment just to...

01:19:02.638 --> 01:19:04.205
         hold her hand.

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:06.941
       And, looking back,

01:19:07.043 --> 01:19:08.876
    I wish I would have ended
        practice earlier

01:19:08.978 --> 01:19:10.544
   so that we could have spent
            more time

01:19:10.646 --> 01:19:15.116
   with the one who supported
          us the most.

01:19:15.218 --> 01:19:17.952
          Your mother.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:21.489
    And I am so sorry, Mary.

01:19:21.591 --> 01:19:24.158
             Sadie.

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:27.928
         And, well, Tom.

01:19:31.801 --> 01:19:35.002
      Mom was really great,
           wasn't she?

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.704
          Yes, she was.

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:39.540
   And I think this Christmas
    we are going to spend it

01:19:39.642 --> 01:19:42.143
          as a family.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:46.347
    And I think that includes
         Tom and Jenny.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:48.315
              Yeah.

01:19:50.553 --> 01:19:52.119
              Hey.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:55.222
     So I had this big plan

01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:58.092
      to give Jenny a very
     special Christmas gift

01:19:58.194 --> 01:19:59.393
  that she would never forget,

01:19:59.495 --> 01:20:04.165
 but, well, getting stuck in the
    chimney kinda ruined it.

01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:05.332
          I need help.

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:06.600
       And I need to make
          a few calls,

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:11.539
    but I'd like for my whole
  family to be a part of this.

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:13.407
      Can you all help me?

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:15.709
           Yeah, sure.

01:20:15.812 --> 01:20:17.211
        I'll support you.

01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.712
          Ok, we're in.

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:21.749
   And I promise I'll stay out
           of the way.

01:20:21.851 --> 01:20:23.551
       Yeah, let's do it!

01:20:23.653 --> 01:20:26.187
          Ok. Let's go.

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:50.978
           ( sobbing )

01:21:00.089 --> 01:21:08.162
           ( sobbing )

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:16.003
           ( sobbing )

01:21:43.966 --> 01:21:45.532
             Jenny?

01:21:45.635 --> 01:21:46.600
             <i> Jenny!</i>

01:21:46.702 --> 01:21:48.502
             <i> Jenny!</i>

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:49.270
             <i> Jenny?</i>

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:52.673
             Jenny!

01:21:52.775 --> 01:21:54.341
             <i> Jenny!</i>

01:21:54.443 --> 01:21:56.243
    <i> Jenny, come on out, now.</i>

01:21:56.312 --> 01:21:57.745
    <i> Everyone's here for you.</i>

01:21:57.847 --> 01:21:59.480
            <i> Come on!</i>

01:21:59.548 --> 01:22:00.414
    <i> We know you're up there,</i>
            <i> come on!</i>

01:22:00.516 --> 01:22:01.916
             <i> Jenny!</i>

01:22:01.984 --> 01:22:03.117
      <i> Jenny, come on out!</i>

01:22:03.219 --> 01:22:04.985
             <i> Jenny!</i>

01:22:06.956 --> 01:22:08.389
             Jenny!

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:14.194
   My boy was pulled to safety
      by a guardian angel.

01:22:14.297 --> 01:22:16.096
   Had it not been for a young
      woman who was willing

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:22.269
    to risk her life for him,
  he may not be here right now.

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:26.440
        You are my hero,
         Jenny Jenkins.

01:22:26.542 --> 01:22:28.943
    I wanna be just like you,
             Jenny.

01:22:29.045 --> 01:22:31.745
      A real American hero.

01:22:31.847 --> 01:22:34.548
       I love you, Jenny.

01:22:34.650 --> 01:22:37.551
       You saved my house
       from catching fire.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:40.421
        And you pulled my
 ex-son-in-law from my chimney.

01:22:40.523 --> 01:22:42.523
        ( crowd laughs )

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.291
   You're a hero, young lady.

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:47.861
   There's no doubt about it.

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:50.764
     If anyone knows what it
       means to be a hero,

01:22:50.866 --> 01:22:52.066
            it's you.

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:55.202
     And that's exactly what
     I wrote to your mother.

01:22:55.304 --> 01:22:56.971
   I'm sure she'll understand
        that it's a book

01:22:57.073 --> 01:22:59.740
about your life she should read.

01:22:59.842 --> 01:23:03.210
            Not mine.

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:06.246
    You are the reason I have
         my father back.

01:23:09.452 --> 01:23:10.985
      And tomorrow morning

01:23:11.087 --> 01:23:14.121
    I get to meet my grandson
       for the first time.

01:23:17.793 --> 01:23:21.862
   I will follow you anywhere,
      firefighter Jenkins.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:27.601
             Jenny.

01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:32.406
  Not long ago, I met the most
         amazing woman.

01:23:35.411 --> 01:23:39.980
      She's tough, strong,
      and has a huge heart.

01:23:40.082 --> 01:23:41.982
   She is willing to sacrifice
      her life for anyone,

01:23:42.084 --> 01:23:44.618
     no matter who they are
    or where they come from.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.819
     Jenny, every single day

01:23:45.955 --> 01:23:48.522
      you inspire me to be
         a better person

01:23:48.624 --> 01:23:53.360
 and you never ask for a single
moment of gratitude from anyone.

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:57.231
     So now we are all here
           to give you

01:23:57.299 --> 01:24:01.835
     the best Christmas gift
        I could think of.

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:04.738
       Jenny, I love you.

01:24:04.807 --> 01:24:07.674
        You are my hero.

01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:09.977
        What did you say?

01:24:11.313 --> 01:24:12.546
           I love her!

01:24:12.615 --> 01:24:14.281
       <i> ( Sadie ): Me too!</i>

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.116
        ( crowd laughs )

01:24:20.589 --> 01:24:23.724
        What did you say?

01:24:23.826 --> 01:24:25.793
           I love you.

01:24:28.264 --> 01:24:29.930
             Tom...

01:24:39.475 --> 01:24:41.341
              Woah.

01:24:43.145 --> 01:24:45.612
              Oh...

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:50.717
        I promise to hold
        and cherish you.

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:53.187
  I want to grow old with you,

01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:56.790
 and never let go of your hand.

01:24:56.892 --> 01:25:01.762
         Please, Jenny.

01:25:01.864 --> 01:25:05.799
  Will you forever be my wife?

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:17.344
              Yes!

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:18.378
              Yes.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:19.246
          ( laughing )

01:25:19.348 --> 01:25:20.280
          She said yes!

01:25:20.382 --> 01:25:23.350
    ( cheering and applause )

01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:47.474
       ( crowd cheering )

01:25:47.576 --> 01:25:49.443
          It's perfect!

01:25:52.181 --> 01:25:53.547
             It is.

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:54.848
         It is perfect.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:26:03.023
          ( applause )

01:26:06.028 --> 01:26:06.994
             Oh, no.

01:26:07.096 --> 01:26:11.999
   No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
         no, no, no, no!

01:26:12.101 --> 01:26:15.369
               No!

01:26:15.437 --> 01:26:18.805
        It's impossible!

01:26:18.908 --> 01:26:25.112
So I'm guessing the car I bought
       yesterday is free!

01:26:25.214 --> 01:26:29.716
          ( cheering )

01:26:34.356 --> 01:26:35.455
         You know what?

01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:37.124
          You're right.

01:26:37.226 --> 01:26:40.861
        Merry Christmas.

01:26:40.963 --> 01:26:44.631
   And a very Merry Christmas
      to every one of you.

01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:03.350
           I love you.

01:27:03.452 --> 01:27:05.719
        I love you, too.
