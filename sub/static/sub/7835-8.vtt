WEBVTT

22:59:00.121 --> 00:03.048
The Simpsons

00:06.386 --> 00:07.469
D'oh!

00:11.808 --> 00:13.100
Oh! My brain!

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:28.574 --> 00:30.534
A library
selling books?

00:30.743 --> 00:31.868
If I don't want them
for free,

00:31.953 --> 00:33.370
why would I want
to pay for them?

00:33.454 --> 00:36.665
Why do you always
wait till we arrive
to complain?

00:38.418 --> 00:39.626
I don't know.

00:39.711 --> 00:43.505
Ah. The full
Leonard Nimoy cycle,
I Am Not Spock,

00:43.965 --> 00:45.298
then I Am Spock,

00:45.383 --> 00:47.718
and finally,
I Am Also Scotty.

00:48.177 --> 00:51.596
Mmm. That's what
we look like inside?

00:51.723 --> 00:53.473
It's disgusting!

00:53.558 --> 00:56.309
Oh. That lady
swallowed a baby!

00:57.812 --> 00:58.895
Good heavens!

00:58.980 --> 01:01.523
Lisa, you're not
buying more than
your weight in books.

01:01.607 --> 01:02.941
But I have to save them.

01:03.025 --> 01:05.736
The books no one buys
get chopped up
and fed to pigs.

01:08.740 --> 01:13.118
Helen Fielding's
giving them pigs
Bridget Jones' diarrhea.

01:14.829 --> 01:18.290
Well, what about this?
The Duff Book of
World Records.

01:18.708 --> 01:21.835
It's got pictures
of deformities.

01:21.919 --> 01:23.378
Okay.

01:26.340 --> 01:27.924
Oh.

01:29.343 --> 01:30.927
Oh, my God!

01:31.220 --> 01:33.972
Wow. Now that's a goiter.

01:34.348 --> 01:36.516
Why would Duff beer
put out a book?

01:36.601 --> 01:39.603
It was originally
published to settle
arguments in taverns.

01:39.687 --> 01:41.271
She said tavern!
I'm going to Moe's!

01:42.440 --> 01:43.523
I never agreed
to that rule!

01:47.320 --> 01:49.613
Well, I say
the most clothespins

01:49.697 --> 01:52.532
a man could attach
to his face is 87!

01:52.742 --> 01:53.992
You counting the neck?

01:54.076 --> 01:55.202
You know I am.

01:55.286 --> 01:57.037
All right. Outside.

01:58.873 --> 02:03.210
Peace, my people.
All shall be looked up.
Let's see.

02:03.294 --> 02:06.463
Most clothespins
swallowed, inserted...

02:06.547 --> 02:10.633
Here we go.
Clipped to face
and neck. 116.

02:10.926 --> 02:14.054
Jeez, I was wrong.
But I ain't angry.

02:14.138 --> 02:16.056
And I'm magnanimous
in victory.

02:16.516 --> 02:18.725
Wow, that's the best book
I've ever seen.

02:18.810 --> 02:22.854
No. The best book
you've ever seen is
Tom Clancy's Op-Center.

02:23.356 --> 02:25.732
That thing knows me
better than I know myself.

02:27.235 --> 02:30.987
Oh. Here's a good one.
The world's most
overrated saint...

02:31.072 --> 02:32.989
Francis of Assisi.
Francis of Assisi.

02:33.074 --> 02:35.784
Oh, I've used up
all these records.

02:35.868 --> 02:37.536
Why don't you try
to set a record, Dad?

02:37.620 --> 02:39.079
That's a great idea!

02:39.163 --> 02:40.997
Do you think
I could run a mile in
three-and-a-half minutes?

02:41.082 --> 02:42.165
Only on Mars.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.417
The Simpsons
are going to Mars!

02:44.710 --> 02:46.253
So pack your...

02:47.129 --> 02:48.880
Or maybe I'll think
of something else.

02:56.222 --> 02:59.266
You're a cinch
to be the world's
fattest man.

02:59.350 --> 03:02.269
No, I'm here for
the greatest living actor.

03:02.770 --> 03:04.771
I'm here to break
a world record.

03:04.856 --> 03:07.691
What's the longest
anyone's ever done this?

03:12.280 --> 03:13.321
Three years.

03:14.490 --> 03:17.158
Fine. I'll just
play the banjo
with this cobra.

03:22.123 --> 03:23.331
Wait, wait, wait!

03:23.416 --> 03:26.710
Technically the cobra
would get the record.
He's the one playing.

03:26.794 --> 03:28.295
But it's my banjo!

03:28.379 --> 03:31.089
Mr. Simpson,
there are thousands
of people like you

03:31.173 --> 03:32.674
with no
discernable talent.

03:32.758 --> 03:34.134
Yeah.
They're called Congress!

03:35.303 --> 03:36.386
Shut up.
Okay.

03:36.470 --> 03:40.307
All the individual records
were set by crackpots
who half killed themselves.

03:40.391 --> 03:42.267
The only way someone new
can get in the book

03:42.351 --> 03:44.352
is with some kind of
group stunt.

03:44.437 --> 03:45.478
Group stunt?

03:45.646 --> 03:48.023
Like that town that
made the world's
largest omelet.

03:48.107 --> 03:49.900
Denver?
No, Spanish.

03:52.904 --> 03:55.739
Fellow Springfielders!
I have called you all here

03:55.823 --> 03:59.367
so we can enter
The Duff Book
of World Records!

04:00.870 --> 04:04.164
We're going to build
the world's tallest
human pyramid!

04:04.248 --> 04:07.167
Finally this town
will have a real
claim to fame.

04:07.251 --> 04:10.128
Aye. We can
stop all the lies.

04:14.759 --> 04:16.468
I haven't seen
this much flesh

04:16.552 --> 04:18.803
since Elke Sommer's
hot tub party.

04:20.014 --> 04:21.473
Seriously, Elke's great.

04:21.557 --> 04:24.517
Always there
for sick kids.
Doing great things.

04:25.269 --> 04:27.479
Okay. Let me
check the specs.

04:28.648 --> 04:29.648
Ah!

04:29.732 --> 04:32.025
My vision is
coming to life!

04:38.366 --> 04:39.616
Hey!
Hey!

04:39.700 --> 04:41.201
Thanks, great.

04:43.162 --> 04:45.622
All right, I'll make
base camp here

04:45.706 --> 04:47.290
and try for
the summit tomorrow.

04:49.085 --> 04:52.462
Yeah, Dad.
You can be the world's
laziest stunt organizer.

04:52.546 --> 04:53.922
Why, you little...

05:23.744 --> 05:25.453
You're about a foot
short of the record.

05:27.581 --> 05:29.582
Wait a minute.

05:31.168 --> 05:33.753
We did it!
Springfield rules!

05:33.963 --> 05:37.257
Not yet.
You have to hold it
for three Mississippi's.

05:37.341 --> 05:39.009
One Mississippi...

05:41.095 --> 05:42.929
Two Mississippi...

05:43.014 --> 05:45.015
Dude, you're
touching my hand!

05:45.099 --> 05:46.099
Ewe!

05:54.108 --> 05:55.483
Oh, my hairstyle!

05:55.568 --> 05:56.609
Not again!

05:58.696 --> 06:00.655
Goodbye, cruel world.

06:01.991 --> 06:03.783
Hello, ironic twist!

06:17.173 --> 06:19.466
I am so far from my car.

06:19.550 --> 06:23.303
Dude, you're lying
on top of me! Dude?

06:24.805 --> 06:27.098
Wait a minute.
Look at the scale!

06:27.641 --> 06:30.727
Divide by
the number of people,
subtract belts and shoes...

06:33.731 --> 06:37.275
Everyone, welcome to
The Duff Book
of World Records!

06:37.485 --> 06:40.737
Springfield is
the world's fattest town!

06:43.282 --> 06:46.117
Woo-hoo!
In your face, Milwaukee!

06:51.290 --> 06:53.833
Congratulations,
fellow Springfielders.

06:54.085 --> 06:57.921
This town will
no longer be known
as "America's Sorrow. "

06:58.005 --> 07:03.301
Today I declare Springfield
"Fat City, USA!"

07:08.182 --> 07:12.852
I can't believe it.
Everyone's celebrating
their obesity!

07:12.978 --> 07:14.437
Yee-ha!

07:22.655 --> 07:24.656
Now that everyone's
so open about being fat,

07:24.740 --> 07:27.534
I can finally stop
sucking in my gut.

07:35.501 --> 07:38.628
I don't know how
this town got so fat.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.713
Mom, we're out
of Frosting Gobs.

07:41.048 --> 07:44.175
Here, have one
of my fudge-stuffed
toaster pies.

07:46.387 --> 07:47.512
Mmm.

07:52.893 --> 07:55.270
You kids do eat
a lot of sugar,

07:55.354 --> 07:58.481
but at least Homer can have
a nice healthy grapefruit.

07:58.566 --> 08:01.734
Yeah. You can't
improve on nature.

08:13.539 --> 08:15.915
Look at all
the empty calories.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.500
Ooh!

08:17.585 --> 08:19.335
Sugar-free donuts!

08:19.420 --> 08:22.463
No, that is sugar
with free donuts.

08:22.756 --> 08:23.923
Huh.

08:24.175 --> 08:28.261
Apu, everything in this store
is overloaded with sugar.

08:28.345 --> 08:29.721
Marge has a point.

08:29.805 --> 08:31.306
Sugar is
not only fattening,

08:31.390 --> 08:33.808
it's also terribly,
terribly addictive.

08:34.727 --> 08:36.561
Is my carton
of Pixy Stix in?

08:36.645 --> 08:37.937
No, it hasn't come in yet.

08:38.022 --> 08:39.188
Damn it!

08:39.440 --> 08:42.357
When they come in,
you call me
at this number.

08:44.153 --> 08:46.237
I am sorry,
but everything
in this store,

08:46.322 --> 08:48.156
from the honey-glazed
cauliflower

08:48.240 --> 08:50.283
to the Choco-Blasted
Baby Aspirin,

08:50.367 --> 08:53.328
comes from
the Motherloving
Sugar Corporation.

08:53.454 --> 08:55.705
Well, I'm going to
have a talk with them.

08:55.789 --> 08:58.291
Where are their worldwide
headquarters located?

08:58.375 --> 08:59.542
Why, right down
the street.

08:59.627 --> 09:00.668
That's lucky.

09:11.263 --> 09:14.724
Excuse me. I'm looking
for the head of
Motherloving Sugar.

09:14.808 --> 09:16.392
Yes.
I'm Garth Motherloving.

09:16.477 --> 09:17.894
I'm Marge Simpson.

09:17.978 --> 09:20.980
Long-time customer,
first-time complainer.

09:21.232 --> 09:23.233
Hey, Marge.
I'm not up on
the current slang,

09:23.317 --> 09:24.609
but do the kids
still say,

09:24.693 --> 09:25.985
"Get the hell
out of my office"?

09:26.070 --> 09:29.530
I want you to stop putting
so much sugar in everything.

09:29.949 --> 09:33.159
Or at least warn people
that it's so unhealthy.

09:33.244 --> 09:35.411
Mmm. That'll boost sales!

09:35.496 --> 09:38.373
While we're at it,
why don't I just change
my name back to Hitler?

09:38.457 --> 09:42.001
Don't you have any sense
of corporate responsibility?

09:44.380 --> 09:45.463
Hey!

09:46.674 --> 09:48.466
Look, lady,
if you have a problem,

09:48.550 --> 09:50.260
bring it up with
your sewing circle, okay?

09:50.344 --> 09:53.263
But we're on hiatus.
Everyone's everywhere.

09:53.639 --> 09:55.598
Note to Marge.
Get out!

09:59.186 --> 10:00.979
I'll play it later.

10:04.525 --> 10:06.651
If you looked up
meanie-beanie-fo-feanie

10:06.735 --> 10:09.362
in the dictionary,
you'd see his picture.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.365
Wait! You went
to a sugar factory?

10:12.449 --> 10:13.658
Were there
Oompa Loompas?

10:13.867 --> 10:16.869
There was one in a cage,
but he wasn't moving.

10:17.871 --> 10:18.997
Oh.

10:19.081 --> 10:21.624
That company's ruining
the whole town's health,

10:21.709 --> 10:23.710
and I don't know
how to stop them.

10:23.794 --> 10:26.337
Why don't you file
a class-action suit?

10:27.047 --> 10:30.466
Oh, yeah!
Like Erin Brockovich.

10:30.551 --> 10:32.552
The prostitute
with the heart of gold.

10:34.054 --> 10:36.806
I'm not sure
I can afford
a fancy lawyer.

10:36.890 --> 10:40.059
That's okay, Mom. Today's
law schools are churning
out 2.1 lawyers

10:40.144 --> 10:42.103
for every person
in America. Look.

10:44.481 --> 10:45.940
Pick me!
Pick me!

10:46.025 --> 10:47.692
Me so litigious!

10:47.776 --> 10:50.987
Pick me! I just
passed the bar, see?

10:53.115 --> 10:54.824
Oh. Hop in.

10:55.159 --> 10:57.535
We want to sue
the sugar industry

10:57.619 --> 10:59.203
for selling
a harmful product.

10:59.288 --> 11:02.749
We have to sign up plaintiffs
and take depositions
from the townspeople.

11:02.833 --> 11:06.002
Ah, jeez.
You don't want old Gil
going door-to-door.

11:06.086 --> 11:07.587
Oh, I've made
too many enemies

11:07.671 --> 11:09.756
selling suckless
vacuum cleaners

11:09.840 --> 11:11.090
and Rick James Bibles.

11:11.175 --> 11:13.051
Don't worry.
I'll do the legwork.

11:14.136 --> 11:17.347
I'm filing
a class-action lawsuit
against big sugar.

11:17.431 --> 11:19.015
Would you like
to give a deposition?

11:19.099 --> 11:20.933
Sure.
I'll join your lawsuit.

11:21.018 --> 11:23.686
Sugar's made my Ralphie
hyperactive.

11:23.771 --> 11:25.605
I'm happy and angry!

11:27.107 --> 11:29.150
Oh, shoot. I'll sign.

11:29.276 --> 11:31.027
Figure them sugar folk
owe me

11:31.111 --> 11:33.112
for what they done
to my cousin,

11:33.322 --> 11:34.655
Dia-Betty.

11:35.074 --> 11:38.618
I'm trying to slim down
so I can fit into
Momma's coffin.

11:40.954 --> 11:42.455
That's my reward.

11:44.917 --> 11:48.961
Now let's see
if I can remember
how to make my mark.

11:52.549 --> 11:55.009
I'll get down
with your lawsuit.

11:55.469 --> 11:59.972
Disco Stu got hooked
on the white stuff
back in the 70s.

12:05.646 --> 12:06.729
More, more, more

12:06.814 --> 12:09.023
How do you like it?
How do you like it?

12:09.108 --> 12:11.359
More, more, more

12:11.443 --> 12:13.653
How do you like it?
How do you like it?

12:13.737 --> 12:15.947
More, more, more

12:23.038 --> 12:24.747
Oh, hello, Homer.

12:24.832 --> 12:26.833
Well, well.
If it isn't the woman

12:26.917 --> 12:30.211
who's too busy
saving the world
to save her own marriage.

12:30.295 --> 12:33.589
What are you talking about?
Is that dinner?

12:33.674 --> 12:35.216
It was dinner!

12:36.677 --> 12:38.970
Why didn't you just
turn off the oven?

12:39.054 --> 12:42.056
I was hoping we could
do that together!

12:49.022 --> 12:50.857
Hello?
Marge Simpson?

12:51.442 --> 12:52.650
Who is this?

12:52.734 --> 12:54.444
I'm an anonymous
whistleblower.

12:54.653 --> 12:56.863
I worked on
a top-secret project

12:56.947 --> 13:00.450
called Operation
Hoyvin-Mayvin!

13:00.701 --> 13:01.909
Professor Frink?

13:01.994 --> 13:03.619
Oh, what gave me away?

13:03.704 --> 13:06.038
Out of curiosity,
was it the hoyvin
or the mayvin

13:06.123 --> 13:08.875
or was it the whole
gahoyving thing that I do?

13:09.710 --> 13:14.505
So, Professor,
tell us about
Operation Hoyvin-Mayvin.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.966
Well, we knew
perfectly well
it was addictive.

13:17.050 --> 13:22.221
Candy was just
a sugar delivery system.
We thought we were God.

13:22.431 --> 13:23.806
Hoyvin-mayvin.

13:23.891 --> 13:26.225
Frink, you little weasel!
I'll kill you!

13:26.310 --> 13:28.478
May I remind you
we're in open court?

13:28.562 --> 13:30.897
I'll kill you, too!
I'll kill you all!

13:30.981 --> 13:33.858
Mr. Motherloving,
that could be interpreted
as a threat.

13:33.942 --> 13:35.151
I'll kill you
while you sleep.

13:35.235 --> 13:36.777
Objection!

13:37.196 --> 13:38.321
I'll allow it.

13:38.489 --> 13:42.450
Now, Count Fudgula,
how long were
you spokes-vampire

13:42.534 --> 13:44.785
for Motherloving's
breakfast cereals?

13:44.870 --> 13:46.913
Twenty of
your mortal years,

13:47.039 --> 13:50.500
but I had to quit when
my fangs succumbed
to gingivitis.

13:50.584 --> 13:53.628
Now all my victims
have to be mashed up.

13:53.837 --> 13:55.087
Aw.

13:55.172 --> 13:57.548
Your Honor, I admit
it looks bad for me,

13:57.633 --> 13:59.133
but I think you might be
turned around

13:59.218 --> 14:01.928
by some surprising
taste-imony.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.186
Sir, this is
a house of justice,
not a sugar shack.

14:10.270 --> 14:12.730
It's Hershey
highwaymen like you
who made me fat.

14:12.814 --> 14:15.399
Well, Your Honor,
the court carries it well.

14:15.484 --> 14:18.611
Silence! I rule in favor
of Marge Simpson!

14:18.737 --> 14:20.821
Yay!

14:21.490 --> 14:23.699
Oh, I am so proud
of you.

14:23.784 --> 14:26.536
And thanks to
Marge Simpson's
damning evidence,

14:26.620 --> 14:30.957
I hereby ban
all sugar products
from Springfield forever.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.625
Get in the car.

14:34.294 --> 14:35.878
Good evening.
Our top story,

14:35.963 --> 14:38.422
Springfield's cake-hole
has been shut forever.

14:38.507 --> 14:40.758
Under what has been dubbed
"Marge's Law,"

14:40.842 --> 14:42.885
all forms of sugar
are now illegal.

14:42.970 --> 14:46.055
Thank you,
Erin Choco-snitch!

14:46.139 --> 14:47.181
That was
a group effort.

14:47.933 --> 14:50.935
I was just trying to make this
a healthier place to live.

14:51.019 --> 14:54.105
Well, good work,
Blue-hair-in-Brocko-witch.

14:55.899 --> 14:57.191
Okay, that was mine.

14:57.359 --> 14:59.443
So, say a bittersweet
farewell

14:59.528 --> 15:01.445
to such old friends
as mud pies,

15:01.530 --> 15:04.240
Bite 'Ems, Eclairios,
Chew 'Ems,
Kellogg's All-Fudge,

15:04.324 --> 15:06.409
Big Red Snack Foam,
Milk Chuds, Eat 'Ems.

15:06.493 --> 15:10.663
And all sugar pills
will be changed back to
highly concentrated opiates.

15:16.003 --> 15:18.170
That's it, boys!
Burn it all!

15:18.338 --> 15:21.465
Even this
promotional Johnny Depp
from the movie Chocolat?

15:21.550 --> 15:24.844
We melted for him.
Now he's gonna do likewise.

15:28.432 --> 15:31.434
All right.
Time to throw in
the Butterfingers.

15:36.815 --> 15:38.441
Hmm.
It's not even singed.

15:38.525 --> 15:40.484
Even the fire
doesn't want them.

15:42.029 --> 15:44.864
Sugar! Need sugar!

15:45.115 --> 15:48.492
Aye. They're not riding
the white horse anymore.

15:48.744 --> 15:51.120
My baby!
Where's my baby?

15:55.375 --> 15:57.627
Nothing left!
Nothing left!

15:59.546 --> 16:01.380
Ooh. A sticky spot!

16:02.633 --> 16:05.635
Mr. Simpson,
you're licking blood
and VapoRub.

16:06.887 --> 16:08.679
Part of me knew that.

16:11.683 --> 16:13.392
There is a small group
committed

16:13.477 --> 16:15.478
to bringing sugar
back to this town

16:15.562 --> 16:18.064
by any means necessary.

16:18.148 --> 16:20.316
I'm with you all the way.
But first...

16:37.709 --> 16:38.793
Cool.

16:46.677 --> 16:49.512
Gentlemen, I have
found the final member
of our cabal.

16:49.596 --> 16:52.932
Count Fudgula?
I thought you wanted
to get off the stuff?

16:53.016 --> 16:55.351
I'm a monster!
Don't look at me!

16:57.104 --> 17:00.564
Homer, we need you
to help us smuggle in sugar
from south of the border.

17:00.649 --> 17:02.191
Oh, you mean Tennessee?

17:02.275 --> 17:05.903
No, the island
of San Glucose.

17:12.452 --> 17:13.703
Good times.

17:18.959 --> 17:22.545
Is it really worth
risking your lives
just for some sugar?

17:22.628 --> 17:26.173
Dessert's on!
I steamed some limes!

17:26.258 --> 17:27.299
Godspeed.

17:29.469 --> 17:31.637
There is the island.

17:31.722 --> 17:32.847
It's go time.

17:41.565 --> 17:42.815
Oh.

17:42.899 --> 17:45.317
I'm only doing this
one more time!

17:51.241 --> 17:52.241
How's he doing?

17:52.325 --> 17:54.326
I think he's grossed out
by some seaweed.

17:54.411 --> 17:55.494
Ew!

17:55.579 --> 17:57.246
I touched it! Over.

17:57.330 --> 17:59.623
Get a grip, Simpson.
You're doing fine.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.959
Now, do you have your map?

18:02.043 --> 18:03.377
Kind of.

18:05.255 --> 18:06.964
Come on! Give it!

18:07.048 --> 18:09.008
I know.
I'll try reverse psychology.

18:09.718 --> 18:12.928
I don't want
that stupid map.

18:13.013 --> 18:14.472
D'oh!

18:15.891 --> 18:19.351
Okay, man, here's the sugar.
Now, you give us the money.

18:19.436 --> 18:21.771
That wasn't
part of the deal.

18:21.855 --> 18:24.190
He's right!
Who wrote this thing?

18:29.571 --> 18:31.155
Well, we're almost home.

18:31.239 --> 18:34.200
Has everyone keistered
their personal supply?

18:36.328 --> 18:38.662
'Cause I sure haven't.

18:38.747 --> 18:40.206
Hold it right there!

18:41.833 --> 18:44.293
Surrender or
prepare to be sunk!

18:44.377 --> 18:47.671
No way!
We'll defy you
to the death!

18:49.633 --> 18:51.425
Stroke, stroke, stroke!

18:51.510 --> 18:54.428
I'm rowing
as fast as I can, sir!

18:54.721 --> 18:56.639
No! I'm having one.

18:56.807 --> 18:59.475
Remember what I told you
about running away
from your troubles?

18:59.559 --> 19:00.851
Yeah.
Let's do it!

19:19.412 --> 19:20.454
My baby!

19:27.254 --> 19:29.922
I like to think we've
made a difference today.

19:33.009 --> 19:34.260
Good work, Simpson.

19:34.344 --> 19:35.803
Before I bring
the sugar in,

19:35.887 --> 19:38.013
I want to see
the Oompa Loompa.

19:38.098 --> 19:39.932
He's right over there.

19:41.643 --> 19:45.437
That guy is freaky.
Well, here's your sugar.

19:46.773 --> 19:48.190
No, Homer!

19:48.275 --> 19:49.859
You'll be condemning
this town

19:49.943 --> 19:52.736
to a life of obesity
and diabetes!

19:53.655 --> 19:54.822
Don't listen to her,
Homer!

19:54.906 --> 19:57.199
Oh, they both make
such good arguments!

19:57.284 --> 20:01.453
Please, Homie.
Dump the sugar. For me.

20:18.305 --> 20:20.639
Sugar is pouring
into the water!

20:27.480 --> 20:29.648
Aye, 'tis a sugary brine.

20:30.525 --> 20:31.567
Mmm.

20:31.651 --> 20:35.905
This sugar shark is delicious.
Ow! Hey, he bit me back!

20:35.989 --> 20:37.031
Oh.

20:37.115 --> 20:38.449
So that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

20:38.825 --> 20:40.743
Gee, everyone looks
so happy.

20:40.827 --> 20:43.370
Indeed, Marge.
And now that
I think of it,

20:43.455 --> 20:45.247
I wildly exceeded
my authority,

20:45.332 --> 20:47.499
and I declare
the sugar ban over!

20:49.336 --> 20:50.377
Can we, Mom? Can we?
Can we, Mom? Can we?

20:50.462 --> 20:51.795
Please, please, please?
Please, please, please?

20:51.880 --> 20:52.922
Oh.

20:53.006 --> 20:55.674
All right,
but take Maggie with you.

21:02.057 --> 21:03.098
Mmm.

21:03.183 --> 21:05.809
I guess you just can't
use the law to nag.

21:05.894 --> 21:09.188
Maybe I should
just stop trying
to change the world.

21:09.606 --> 21:12.107
No, Marge.
I love when you do that.

21:12.692 --> 21:16.028
You're a regular
Caring-a-lot-ovich.

21:16.988 --> 21:18.739
That's the best one.

21:18.823 --> 21:20.282
That's what I told Lisa.

21:24.996 --> 21:26.288
Sugar

21:26.373 --> 21:28.707
Ah, honey, honey

21:28.792 --> 21:30.918
Hey, I found some pearls.

21:31.002 --> 21:32.419
No, wait.
They're just my teeth.

21:32.796 --> 21:35.798
Well, I can still
make a necklace
out of them.

21:39.135 --> 21:40.886
Honey

21:41.888 --> 21:44.390
Ah, sugar, sugar

21:45.976 --> 21:49.144
You are my candy girl

21:49.396 --> 21:52.564
And you got me wanting you

21:54.693 --> 21:58.445
I just can't believe
the loveliness of loving you

21:58.571 --> 22:01.782
I just can't believe it's true

22:02.409 --> 22:06.120
I just can't believe
the wonder of
this feeling, too

22:06.204 --> 22:09.289
I just can't believe it's true

22:09.374 --> 22:11.625
Ah, sugar

22:12.711 --> 22:15.921
Ah, honey, honey

22:16.798 --> 22:20.092
You are my candy girl....
