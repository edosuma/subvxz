03:44.742 --> 03:45.708
It's all the talk on Broadway

03:48.880 --> 03:49.645
Why cast him, then?

03:49.681 --> 03:51.581
Because movie stars sell tickets.

03:51.616 --> 03:52.615
Just ask my mother.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.276
She is the play's director
and a true artist.

04:22.312 --> 04:24.945
Your production of
"Antigone" was a revelation.

chance to work together

04:30.286 --> 04:31.985
after all these years, and this happens.

04:32.020 --> 04:34.254
- The two of you were friends?
- Yeah, since theater school.

04:34.289 --> 04:35.755
Zane dropped out to go to Hollywood,

04:35.790 --> 04:37.124
but we stayed close.

04:37.159 --> 04:37.991
Do you know what he was doing here

04:38.026 --> 04:39.292
in the theater by himself last night?

04:39.328 --> 04:42.262
He was terrified... of "Hamlet."

04:42.297 --> 04:44.331
He really wanted to show his
acting chops in this role.

04:44.366 --> 04:47.501
Sometimes he would come here
after hours to work more.

04:47.536 --> 04:49.568
Ryan: Was Zane having problems
with anyone you know of?

04:49.604 --> 04:51.470

04:51.506 --> 04:53.572
for sleeping with his leading ladies.

04:53.608 --> 04:55.941
Are you saying Zane was sleeping with

04:55.976 --> 04:57.276
the actress playing Ophelia?

04:57.311 --> 04:59.145
Naomi Fox. Mm-hmm.

04:59.180 --> 05:00.513
They had a messy breakup recently.

05:00.548 --> 05:02.281
She sort of went all "Fatal Attraction."

05:02.316 --> 05:05.517
So she took a baseball bat to his DB9.

05:05.552 --> 05:07.985
He had me take photos for his insurance.

05:08.021 --> 05:09.521
Oh!

05:09.556 --> 05:11.589
- Did he report that to the police?
- No.

05:11.625 --> 05:14.492
Look, I-I've worked with Naomi before,
and she's crazy,

05:14.528 --> 05:17.828
but actor crazy, not murderer crazy.

05:17.864 --> 05:19.864
However, there is one teeny,
tiny, little thing

05:19.899 --> 05:21.299
you should know about.

05:21.334 --> 05:22.766
Naomi's a method actor,

05:22.801 --> 05:25.335
meaning she doesn't <i>play</i> the characters.

05:25.371 --> 05:26.436
She becomes them.

05:26.472 --> 05:28.205
Do you know where we can find her?

05:28.240 --> 05:30.340
I just hope I wasn't
too obvious back there.

05:30.376 --> 05:32.309
I'm just such a big
fan of Erin Cherloff.

05:32.344 --> 05:34.344
- Who, the director?
- Yeah, she's amazing.

05:34.380 --> 05:36.180
I'm... Just speaking with her,
I got this great idea

05:36.215 --> 05:37.981
for the play at Sarah Grace's preschool

05:38.016 --> 05:39.215
where I'm a parent volunteer at.

05:39.250 --> 05:41.684
Wait, preschools have plays now?

05:41.719 --> 05:44.687
My preschool was going to
work with my mom every day.

05:44.722 --> 05:45.588
Oh, same here.

05:45.623 --> 05:48.157
I grew up in hallways just like this.

05:48.193 --> 05:49.792
Spending time in my
mother's dressing room,

05:49.827 --> 05:53.128
experimenting with her costumes,
her makeup.

05:55.500 --> 05:56.931
Oh, get over it.

05:56.966 --> 06:00.669
Anyway, maybe our method actress
has gone a little <i> too</i> method.

06:00.704 --> 06:03.538
In the play, Hamlet drives Ophelia mad.

06:03.574 --> 06:07.242
If this is life imitating art
and she's gone full Ophelia,

06:07.277 --> 06:10.144
we should be ready for anything.

Look, Naomi, we know that you were
having a show-mance with Zane.

06:50.417 --> 06:52.884
He dumped you,
and then you busted up his car.

06:52.919 --> 06:55.554
My lord,
he speaks with a curious tongue.

06:55.589 --> 06:56.521
Car?

06:56.557 --> 06:58.423
It's what he's gonna
put you in the back of

06:58.459 --> 06:59.625
when he arrests you for murder.

06:59.660 --> 07:02.861
So stop the Daniel Day-Lewis
routine and start talking, or...

07:04.830 --> 07:07.064
Okay, look, I wasn't in my right mind

07:07.099 --> 07:08.799
when I smashed up Zane's car,

07:08.834 --> 07:10.268
but I didn't kill him.

07:10.303 --> 07:11.636
You have to believe me.

07:11.671 --> 07:12.470
I was out late last night

07:12.505 --> 07:14.138
bar-hopping with some of the cast.

07:14.173 --> 07:15.005
You can check it out.

07:15.040 --> 07:16.907
Bar-hopping? So you're not full method.

07:16.942 --> 07:19.277
Unless she was drinking mead
and eating with her fingers.

07:19.312 --> 07:22.479
Look, I really cared for Zane,

07:22.514 --> 07:24.914
but he was acting like
he was cheating on me,

07:24.949 --> 07:27.150
showing up at my place at
all hours of the night,

07:27.185 --> 07:28.418
lame excuses.

07:28.453 --> 07:30.454
So I confronted him, and he blew up,

07:30.556 --> 07:32.656
told me never to ask
where he goes again.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.201
Any idea who this other woman might be?

07:34.267 --> 07:34.900
No.

07:35.093 --> 07:38.394
But whoever she was,
she brought out his dark side.

07:47.771 --> 07:51.407
So, why is there a video
of Zane's body on the news?

07:51.442 --> 07:53.909
A stalker-azzi snuck
onto the crime scene

face of the investigation.

08:13.295 --> 08:15.095
- It's not all bad news, Beckett.
- How?

08:15.130 --> 08:16.263
That's a great photo of me.

08:16.298 --> 08:18.131
Do we have a suspect?

08:18.166 --> 08:20.200
Not yet. Naomi's alibi checked out.

08:20.236 --> 08:21.201
But we do have a lead

08:21.237 --> 08:23.704
on this mystery woman
that Zane was seeing.

08:23.739 --> 08:24.738
His financials came in.

08:24.773 --> 08:27.574
They say that he rented
a limo yesterday morning.

08:27.610 --> 08:30.209
Which makes sense,
since Naomi trashed his DB9.

08:30.245 --> 08:31.944
- And where was this limo going?
- I don't know yet.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.578
I'm still waiting for the
driver to call me back,

08:33.615 --> 08:34.679

who this woman is.

08:34.799 --> 08:36.182
I have already found her.

08:36.217 --> 08:38.616
It turns out that Zane
was renting a suite

08:38.653 --> 08:41.287
at the Black Door Hotel
under a fake name.

08:41.322 --> 08:44.424
- Ah, the Black Door. Yes, very fancy.
- Mm.

08:44.459 --> 08:47.225
Known for being discreet...

08:47.261 --> 08:48.126
is what I've heard

08:48.162 --> 08:50.628
from other people who were once single

08:50.664 --> 08:51.563
and now married.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.398
Well,
they certainly seem to be living up

08:53.434 --> 08:54.566
to that reputation.

08:54.601 --> 08:57.602
Wouldn't say a word until I
accused them of obstruction.

08:57.637 --> 09:00.105
But Zane has had a suite
there for the past two weeks,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.107
and he was with a woman
there every night.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.240
Okay, who is this woman?

09:03.276 --> 09:06.310
No idea. She's not a registered guest,
but get this.

09:06.345 --> 09:09.146
Not only did she arrive after
our time-of-death window.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.214
She's still there.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.319
Privacy light is on.

09:15.354 --> 09:17.121
She must still be here.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.756
[Knock on door]

09:19.792 --> 09:21.091
NYPD.

09:22.594 --> 09:23.726
Could you open it, please?

09:25.330 --> 09:26.729
[Lock beeps]

09:29.267 --> 09:31.534
- NYPD.
- Police.

09:40.311 --> 09:43.612
Psst. [Whispering]
There's a ginger in the bed.

09:46.117 --> 09:47.649
[Gasps]

09:47.684 --> 09:48.917
Mother?!

09:48.952 --> 09:49.951
Richard?

09:51.243 --> 09:53.617

09:58.730 --> 09:59.729
[Sighs]

09:59.765 --> 10:04.901
I, um...
I got tired waiting for Zane last night,

10:04.936 --> 10:08.165
so I just, uh, crawled into bed.

10:08.272 --> 10:10.840
Never could I imagine
what happened to him.

10:10.875 --> 10:12.241
Mother, why are you... [Sighs]

10:12.276 --> 10:16.245
Why... Why...
Why were you in Zane's bed?

10:16.280 --> 10:18.213
Because he was late for our session.

10:19.316 --> 10:20.949
What kind of session?

10:20.985 --> 10:22.250
Is that what they call it?

10:22.285 --> 10:23.451
- That's enough.
- Okay.

10:23.487 --> 10:25.621
Mother, are you saying you
were sleeping with Zane Cannon?

10:25.656 --> 10:29.958
Oh, drop the gavel, Richard!

10:30.506 --> 10:34.029
I was his acting coach,
certainly not his mistress.

10:34.064 --> 10:36.964
The poor boy was out of his
depth trying to play Hamlet,

10:37.000 --> 10:38.365
so he was referred to me.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.869
Zane needed me to be
on call 24 hours a day.

10:41.904 --> 10:43.203
So he had this suite

10:43.239 --> 10:46.672
so that we could meet
comfortably at any time.

10:46.923 --> 10:50.077
We turned this room into
a temple to the Bard.

10:50.113 --> 10:53.146
It also became a temple to a new life.

10:53.181 --> 10:54.280
What do you mean, "new life"?

10:54.315 --> 10:55.381
Well, you know I'm a life coach.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.818
I helped Zane to just clear
out the clutter of stardom

10:58.854 --> 11:01.821
so that he could focus on his craft.

11:01.857 --> 11:03.589
Did he ever mention having any enemies?

11:03.625 --> 11:05.825
No, but he did have some demons, though.

11:05.861 --> 11:07.593
There was something in his past

11:07.629 --> 11:09.061
that was a real block for him.

11:09.096 --> 11:10.162
Certainly he told you
what the block was.

11:10.197 --> 11:12.931
No, he was very secretive about it,
frightened, even.

11:12.967 --> 11:14.432
Oh, of course I encouraged him

11:14.468 --> 11:16.268
to engage with those demons, and...

11:17.371 --> 11:19.271
Wait a minute. The last time we spoke,

11:19.306 --> 11:23.909
he said that he had made
arrangements to do just that.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.778
Oh, dear God.

11:26.813 --> 11:30.347
Don't tell me that I might
have pushed him into something

11:30.383 --> 11:31.615
that got him killed.

11:31.651 --> 11:34.085
No. No. Nothing like that.

11:34.120 --> 11:34.986
No.

11:35.855 --> 11:37.288
- No?
- No, come on.

11:37.323 --> 11:39.356
Let's get you home. Come on.

11:39.392 --> 11:41.358
Beckett: Ryan, wait.

11:41.394 --> 11:42.993
Hey, listen.

11:43.028 --> 11:45.128
It's my turn to plan date night,
but I forgot,

11:45.164 --> 11:46.629
and Castle's gonna lord it over me

11:46.665 --> 11:48.431
if I don't outdo what he did last week.

11:48.466 --> 11:50.200
So I need a few ideas.

11:50.235 --> 11:51.434
[Chuckling] Wait for Castle? Yeah.

11:51.469 --> 11:52.435
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.304
The, uh... The guy who, uh,

11:54.339 --> 11:57.140
took you on an urbanspelunking adventure

11:57.176 --> 11:59.475
through the city subway
tunnels last Halloween,

11:59.511 --> 12:01.476
and then he hired actors

12:01.512 --> 12:03.545
to re-enact scenes from the movie
"C.H.U.D."

12:03.581 --> 12:05.547
Yeah, I can't...
I can't come up with stuff like that.

12:05.583 --> 12:06.448
Yo.

12:06.483 --> 12:08.217
I just heard back from that limo driver

12:08.252 --> 12:10.052
that Zane hired the
morning of his murder.

12:10.088 --> 12:11.453
You'll never believe where he went...

12:11.488 --> 12:12.521
Sing Sing Penitentiary.

12:12.556 --> 12:13.322
Why did he go there?

12:13.357 --> 12:15.891
To pick up a newly released inmate...

12:15.927 --> 12:18.359
Johnny Toro, who also happens to be

12:18.394 --> 12:19.794
his estranged older stepbrother.

12:19.830 --> 12:22.496
How did we not know that
Zane had a stepbrother?

12:22.532 --> 12:23.564
Different dads, different names,

12:23.600 --> 12:26.034
and according to Zane's publicist,
he kept it quiet.

12:26.069 --> 12:27.135
He didn't want to be
associated with this guy.

12:27.170 --> 12:28.970
- Then why'd he show up at the prison?
- I don't know.

12:29.005 --> 12:30.404
According to the limo driver, though,

12:30.440 --> 12:33.041
it was far from a happy family reunion.

12:33.076 --> 12:34.041
The privacy screen was up,

12:34.076 --> 12:35.843
but he could tell that
Toro was yelling at Zane.

12:35.878 --> 12:37.711
He served 12 years for a B&E.

12:37.747 --> 12:40.380
Where he stewed on how
much he hated Zane.

12:40.415 --> 12:42.482
Check out the prison
psychologist's notes.

12:42.517 --> 12:45.819
Apparently, there was a lot
of built-up rage against Zane.

12:45.855 --> 12:49.556
You know, evidence suggests that
this break-in was a two-man job.

12:49.591 --> 12:51.357
Cops suspected Zane

12:51.392 --> 12:52.825
but only had evidence against Toro.

12:52.861 --> 12:54.393
And then Toro took the fall.

12:54.428 --> 12:56.562
And Zane moves to Hollywood
and becomes a movie star.

12:56.597 --> 12:58.397
All right, get him in here.

12:58.432 --> 13:00.933
This what it's gonna be
like now I'm on parole?

13:00.969 --> 13:03.502
Just can't go a day without
being harassed by the cops?

13:03.537 --> 13:05.404
Not when you set a record
for fastest recidivism.

13:05.439 --> 13:08.506
You were out all of 10 hours
before you murdered Zane.

13:08.541 --> 13:10.208
See?

13:10.244 --> 13:11.143
Soon as I saw the news,

13:11.178 --> 13:12.443
I knew y'all were gonna hang that on me.

13:12.479 --> 13:13.411
Really? That's your response?

13:13.446 --> 13:15.680
Not...
Not, "Boo-hoo, my stepbrother's dead."

13:15.715 --> 13:17.048
Screw you.

13:17.084 --> 13:18.750
I'm busted up over what happened to Z.

13:18.786 --> 13:19.751
No, you're pissed that

13:19.787 --> 13:21.153
he let you take the rap
all those years ago.

13:21.188 --> 13:24.256
[Scoffs] I don't know what the
hell you're talking about, man.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.957
I was the big brother.

13:26.993 --> 13:31.262
I made Z keep his mouth shut
on that B&E we pulled, man.

13:31.297 --> 13:32.963
Told him to make something of himself.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.698
Come on, bro. Your prison shrink noted

13:34.733 --> 13:36.767
that you had a giant hate-on for Zane.

13:36.803 --> 13:38.502
He abandoned me.

13:40.572 --> 13:42.405
And not one visit.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.524
No calls.

13:44.877 --> 13:46.976
Didn't put any money on my books.

13:47.012 --> 13:48.812
Nothing.

13:48.847 --> 13:52.115
Just went off to become a star,
and he left me to rot.

13:52.150 --> 13:54.884
Limo driver said things got pretty
heated when he picked you up.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.886
Yeah,
but what the limo driver didn't hear

13:56.922 --> 14:00.622
was us squashing our beef,
'cause he apologized,

14:00.657 --> 14:03.391
said he would set me up
for the rest of my life.

14:03.427 --> 14:05.660
Just had to get his financial
problems figured out.

14:05.696 --> 14:06.461
What financial problems?

14:06.496 --> 14:08.396
Zane had $10 million in the bank.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.099
He owed the IRS 15 mil in back taxes.

14:11.135 --> 14:12.801
He was gonna be broke
in like two months.

14:12.837 --> 14:13.869
Then why'd he walk away

14:13.904 --> 14:16.137
from an $8 million payday in that
"Safe Word" movie

14:16.172 --> 14:17.571
to go do Shakespeare?

14:17.606 --> 14:19.974
He said he had a plan to get paid.

14:20.009 --> 14:21.642
Something big, man.

14:21.677 --> 14:25.112
Sounds like whatever money-making
scheme Zane was involved in

14:25.148 --> 14:26.914
is probably what got him killed.

14:26.950 --> 14:27.982
Only question is...

14:28.017 --> 14:29.650
What the hell are you doing, Kevin?

14:29.685 --> 14:30.517
[Whooshes]

14:30.553 --> 14:32.419
Yeah, figured it out.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.254
- What he was involved in?
- No, no, no, no, no.

14:34.289 --> 14:36.489
The, uh, new choreography for
Sarah Grace's preschool play.

14:36.524 --> 14:38.091
Oh, good.
Why don't you keep working on that

14:38.126 --> 14:39.459
while I solve our homicide?

14:39.494 --> 14:41.561
Let me get a plain... plain hot dog.

14:44.399 --> 14:45.332
Hey, Javi.

14:45.367 --> 14:46.967
Yeah?

14:47.002 --> 14:49.502
We are being filmed.

14:52.673 --> 14:55.707
That's that stalker-azzi I
chased off the crime scene.

14:55.743 --> 14:57.943
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

14:57.979 --> 15:00.112
This is a public street.
I have the right to film here.

15:00.147 --> 15:01.213
Oh, cool, cool, cool.

15:01.249 --> 15:03.182
We just want to know
<i>why</i> you're filming us.

15:03.217 --> 15:04.716
Well,
I want the same thing you guys do...

15:04.752 --> 15:06.785
An ending to Zane Cannon's story.

15:06.820 --> 15:07.886
Wait a minute.

15:07.921 --> 15:10.788
You've been tracking our
investigation by tracking us?

15:10.823 --> 15:12.357
I've been working on an exposé on Zane

15:12.392 --> 15:14.192
ever since he dropped out of the movie
"Safe Word"

15:14.227 --> 15:14.993
to play Hamlet.

15:15.028 --> 15:16.560
[Chuckles]

15:16.596 --> 15:18.829
I knew that pretty boy was a
train wreck waiting to happen.

15:18.865 --> 15:19.998
You've been following Zane?

15:20.033 --> 15:23.601
On and off, ever since he
got to New York a month ago.

15:25.335 --> 15:27.504
So, did you see him on
the night of his murder?

15:28.908 --> 15:30.073
Look, come on.

15:30.109 --> 15:31.641
You want an ending to your story?

15:31.676 --> 15:32.910
Why don't you show us what you got?

15:32.945 --> 15:34.511
Maybe we can do you a favor.

15:34.546 --> 15:36.646
Yeah, I don't work for favors.

15:36.681 --> 15:38.015
I want an interview with the killer.

15:38.050 --> 15:39.349
[Chuckles] Yeah, and I want

15:39.385 --> 15:41.384
a baby unicorn with a rainbow tail

15:41.419 --> 15:43.352
for my daughter.

15:43.388 --> 15:44.686
We're both gonna be disappointed, pal.

15:44.722 --> 15:46.688
Come on, man. Show us what you got.

15:46.724 --> 15:48.224
If it's any good,
when we make an arrest,

15:48.259 --> 15:49.691
we'll let you film the perp walk.

15:49.727 --> 15:50.726
Deal?

15:52.096 --> 15:54.563
Let's go for a walk.

15:54.598 --> 15:57.766
I filmed this yesterday at
the theater around 4:00.

15:57.802 --> 15:59.667
That's about six hours
before Zane was killed.

16:01.271 --> 16:02.770
[Keyboard clacks]

16:02.806 --> 16:04.406
<i>- Oh, yeah, it's right here.
- You got what I need?</i>

16:04.441 --> 16:05.740
Who's the guy with the tats?

16:05.775 --> 16:07.575
No idea.

16:07.610 --> 16:09.744
<i>Have him give me a call ASAP, all right?</i>

16:09.779 --> 16:10.578
<i>Cool?</i>

16:10.613 --> 16:14.049
<i>No guarantees, man. Here you go.</i>

16:14.084 --> 16:15.782
<i>- Who... Who's that, Zane?
- Yo!</i>

16:15.818 --> 16:17.384
<i>Why'd you pay him all
that cash for the phone?</i>

16:17.420 --> 16:18.185
<i>Come on! [Tires screeching]</i>

16:18.220 --> 16:19.253
<i>Come on. Give me that camera!</i>

16:19.288 --> 16:20.421
<i>Give me that camera.
You're gonna get me killed.</i>

16:20.456 --> 16:23.790
[Chuckles] Hell,
I thought Zane was just being dramatic.

16:23.826 --> 16:24.891
I guess I was dead wrong.

16:24.927 --> 16:26.726
Okay, we're gonna need you
to leave the room, Jake.

16:26.762 --> 16:27.761
Heck, maybe get that facial recognition.

16:27.796 --> 16:29.463
- We'll print out something.
- Yeah... No, no, no.

16:29.498 --> 16:30.264
Leave the laptop.

16:30.299 --> 16:31.765
No way, lady. This is my property.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.433
Jake. Now.

16:33.468 --> 16:35.134
Geez.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.735
[Sighs]

16:36.771 --> 16:38.278
What the hell did Zane
get himself mixed up with?

16:38.344 --> 16:40.273
There's only one way to know.
[Keyboard clacks]

16:40.308 --> 16:41.707
We got to find this mystery man.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.150
Yo, L.T., have you seen Ryan?

16:47.186 --> 16:48.719
I think he's in the box.

16:51.023 --> 16:52.957
Ãlodie, thank you very much

16:52.992 --> 16:55.592
for taking time to Skype with me.

16:55.627 --> 16:57.627
I just... I wanted to share with you

16:57.662 --> 16:58.895
my vision of the play.

16:58.930 --> 16:59.996
<i>Your vision?</i>

17:00.031 --> 17:05.667
Yeah, I see the kids as
embodying the circle of life.

<i>It's just a flower dance.</i>

17:07.038 --> 17:08.570
Let me just show you what I mean.

17:08.607 --> 17:10.807
Okay, so, the kids...
They're stacked up,

17:10.842 --> 17:12.907
and then flower, flower.

17:12.943 --> 17:14.810
They're...
They're exploding, fanning out.

17:14.845 --> 17:16.979
Flower, flower, flower!

17:17.013 --> 17:17.679
Fun!

17:21.284 --> 17:23.351
And then... Then they circle back.

can just sing the song.</i>

17:31.961 --> 17:33.694
I think we need to think
outside the box here.

17:33.730 --> 17:35.696
<i>Think outside of the box next year,</i>

17:35.732 --> 17:37.131

17:37.166 --> 17:40.300
Oh, well, hey, élodie,
if you're gonna be like that,

17:40.336 --> 17:42.770
maybe we need to look into
your unpaid parking tickets,

17:42.805 --> 17:43.604
run them through the system...

17:43.640 --> 17:45.339
Kevin. See if there's any lien...

17:45.374 --> 17:47.607
We've got that, uh,
case that we're working.

17:47.643 --> 17:49.009
<i>Yeah, okay, bye.</i>

17:49.044 --> 17:50.543
[Keyboard clacks] Stop.

17:50.578 --> 17:52.078
Step away from the laptop.

17:56.885 --> 17:59.052
Yeah, that's the same guy

17:59.087 --> 18:01.387
that Zane bought the
burner phone off of.

18:01.422 --> 18:02.955
This footage is dated four weeks ago,

18:02.990 --> 18:05.257
so obviously he and Zane
had an ongoing arrangement.

18:06.527 --> 18:08.360
Hold up. I-I recognize this guy.

18:09.997 --> 18:12.297
Yeah, that's Alejandro Guzman.

18:12.332 --> 18:13.832
He's a big shot-caller

18:13.868 --> 18:16.702
for a gang called Los Malditos...
The Damned.

18:16.737 --> 18:18.137
They operate out of Spanish Harlem.

18:18.172 --> 18:19.971
That's the same neighborhood
that Zane grew up in.

18:20.006 --> 18:22.306
Maybe the two of them knew
each other back in the day.

18:22.341 --> 18:23.274
Before Zane got famous

18:23.309 --> 18:25.043
doing all those
"Apocalypse Runner" movies.

18:25.078 --> 18:25.943
We'll go up to Spanish Harlem

18:25.979 --> 18:28.046
and see if we can track down this guy.

18:28.081 --> 18:30.014
I know nothing about nothing.

18:30.050 --> 18:33.250
Well, we got you on video
having a meeting with Zane

18:33.286 --> 18:34.418
on the day he was murdered.

18:34.453 --> 18:36.720
You got me on video killing him?

18:36.755 --> 18:39.022
Yeah, that's what I thought. May I go?

18:39.058 --> 18:39.923
- Not yet.
- No.

18:39.958 --> 18:41.324
See, we did our homework.

18:41.359 --> 18:43.894
Yeah,
we know that your little brother Antonio

18:43.929 --> 18:46.229
is doing a little stretch
upstate at Fishkill.

18:46.264 --> 18:50.167
That's a long way for your
mother to travel on visiting day,

18:50.202 --> 18:51.334
especially with her bad knees.

18:51.369 --> 18:52.703
How do you know about my mama?

18:52.738 --> 18:54.937
Oh, I, uh... I got an old Army buddy

18:54.972 --> 18:57.006
who works for the Federal
Bureau of Prisons.

18:57.041 --> 18:58.174
He slipped me your file.

18:58.209 --> 19:00.176
Hey, Javi, I bet your old Army buddy

19:00.211 --> 19:02.745
could get his brother
transferred closer to the city,

19:02.780 --> 19:04.346
make those visits a
little easier on mama.

19:04.381 --> 19:06.248
Yeah,
but he'd have to be willing to talk.

19:06.283 --> 19:08.117
I don't make deals with police.

19:08.152 --> 19:10.285
Oh, that's... That's fine.

19:10.321 --> 19:13.621
My buddy also tells me that
there's a bunch of openings

19:13.656 --> 19:15.456
at a federal penitentiary in Georgia.

19:15.491 --> 19:17.125
It would be, like, what,
a 13-, 14-hour bus ride?

19:17.160 --> 19:18.126
At least.

19:18.161 --> 19:19.594
Kind of rough on mama.

19:19.629 --> 19:22.130
All right.

19:22.165 --> 19:25.266
I'll talk about Zane,
but I'm not giving you names.

19:25.301 --> 19:27.135
I'm not ratting anyone out in my crew.

19:27.170 --> 19:28.102
Keep talking.

19:28.137 --> 19:30.270
I knew Zane back in the day.

19:30.305 --> 19:32.239
Just a neighborhood punk.

19:32.274 --> 19:34.074
A month ago, he shows up out of the blue

19:34.110 --> 19:35.976
asking to get in touch with my boss.

19:36.011 --> 19:36.944
Who's your boss?

19:38.114 --> 19:42.415
Hold up, are you talking about...
the <i> boss</i> boss?

19:42.451 --> 19:43.383
El Oso?

19:43.418 --> 19:44.917
I said no names.

19:44.953 --> 19:47.486
Wait, El Oso? Head of the cartel?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.122
The Mexican government,
the D.E.A., the FBI...

19:49.157 --> 19:50.189
They're all looking for this guy.

19:50.225 --> 19:52.491
He escaped from prison in
Mexico three months ago.

19:52.526 --> 19:55.895
Are... Are you saying that you
know where El Oso is hiding?

19:55.930 --> 19:56.763
Of course not.

19:56.798 --> 19:58.231
Then why would Zane come to see you?

19:58.266 --> 19:59.932
Because I got a little bird,

19:59.968 --> 20:02.167
and I put out my little
bird to the right people

20:02.202 --> 20:04.169
until the message gets to you know who.

20:04.204 --> 20:07.605
Clearly,
you charge for this littlebird service.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.941
10 grand gets you a burner.

20:09.977 --> 20:12.110
If the boss wants to talk,
you get a phone call.

20:12.146 --> 20:14.146
And a month ago,
Zane wanted to talk to your boss.

20:14.181 --> 20:14.946
Why?

20:14.982 --> 20:17.615
Some kind of business proposition.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.184
Zane even got himself a
face-to-face with the boss

20:20.219 --> 20:23.087
'cause he's a movie star and all.

20:23.122 --> 20:25.228
Only, from what I hear,
it didn't go so good.

20:25.341 --> 20:27.207
So why did Zane buy
another burner from you

20:27.243 --> 20:28.342
on the day he was killed?

20:28.377 --> 20:29.977
I don't know.

20:30.013 --> 20:32.279
But if he pissed off
the boss a second time,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.048
it's not on me he ended up dead.

20:34.083 --> 20:37.017
Jorge "El Oso" Zamacona.

20:37.052 --> 20:41.021
He's part folk hero, part demon,
the rest pure monster.

20:41.056 --> 20:42.455
The man kills anyone who crosses him...

20:42.490 --> 20:44.824
Cops, journalists, politicians.

20:44.860 --> 20:46.793
Zane must have been
real desperate for money

20:46.828 --> 20:48.094
to want to do business with this guy.

20:48.130 --> 20:51.164
Maybe he wanted to be El Oso's
new drug pipeline to Hollywood.

20:51.199 --> 20:52.365
Well, chances are we'll never find out.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.001
I mean, if the D.E.A., FBI,
<i>and</i> the Mexican government

20:56.037 --> 20:57.136
can't find him,

20:57.171 --> 20:58.336
then what chances do we have?

20:58.372 --> 21:00.072
I'll reach out to my Fed contacts.

21:00.107 --> 21:02.374
Well, we'll drill down all of
El Oso's stateside connections.

21:02.409 --> 21:03.441
Okay.

21:06.380 --> 21:10.381
Well, I suppose that puts
the brakes on our date night.

21:10.416 --> 21:13.017
Uh, yeah. Sorry, Castle.

21:13.053 --> 21:14.351
Oh, no, I'm sorry for you.

21:14.387 --> 21:16.020
You're the one who put all the
planning into our special evening.

21:16.056 --> 21:17.388
Yeah, I-I did.

21:17.423 --> 21:19.857
I...Yeah, I did.

21:19.893 --> 21:21.993
You know what? I think I'll
take my mother out to dinner,

21:22.028 --> 21:23.194
maybe cheer her up after all this.

21:23.229 --> 21:24.929
You're such a good son.

21:24.964 --> 21:26.530

I know you're busy, but is Richard here?

23:24.819 --> 23:26.885
No. I thought he was at dinner with you.

23:26.921 --> 23:29.021
[Chuckling] Yeah, well,
he didn't show up,

23:29.057 --> 23:30.056
and his cell went right to voice-mail.

23:30.091 --> 23:33.192
So I figured he must be
here immersed in the case.

23:33.227 --> 23:35.393
Well, he's probably out playing
with his fancy new credit card,

23:35.429 --> 23:37.113
but let me check in on him.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.966

24:02.088 --> 24:04.821
I saw you on the news.

24:04.857 --> 24:06.190
You're working with the Federales

24:06.225 --> 24:08.092
to investigate Zane Cannon's death.

24:08.127 --> 24:09.225
You mean his murder.

24:09.260 --> 24:12.095
Well, I mean, uh, we know that

24:12.130 --> 24:13.896
Zane, uh, was in contact with you

24:13.931 --> 24:15.098
about a business proposition

24:15.133 --> 24:17.600
and that you were in contact with him

24:17.635 --> 24:20.269
just hours before his
un-untimely demise.

24:20.305 --> 24:21.337
You think I killed him.

24:21.373 --> 24:24.107
You have been associated

24:24.142 --> 24:26.174
with a fair amount of violence
in your past. [Chuckles]

24:28.045 --> 24:32.680
I believe the adjective you're
looking for is, uh, "epic."

24:32.716 --> 24:37.185
An epic amount of violence.
Some might even say biblical.

24:37.221 --> 24:40.288
So you can see why your
involvement with Zane

24:40.324 --> 24:42.257
would have the police curious.

24:42.292 --> 24:44.525
If I wanted him dead,
I would have cut him open

24:44.560 --> 24:46.527
when he was standing where you are now.

24:46.562 --> 24:48.396
I wouldn't kill him with a pen.

24:48.431 --> 24:49.230
That's cute.

24:49.265 --> 24:51.465
Do I look like a man who kills cute?

24:51.501 --> 24:52.900
No. No, certainly not.

24:52.935 --> 24:54.801
You also don't look like the sort of man

24:54.837 --> 24:56.870
who needs to resort to
cheap scare tactics.

24:56.906 --> 24:58.406
I mean, why don't you just untie me?

24:58.441 --> 24:59.306
We'll sit down,

24:59.342 --> 25:02.208
and you tell me why you brought me here.

25:05.980 --> 25:07.013
[Snaps fingers]

25:15.257 --> 25:16.189
Thank you.

25:16.224 --> 25:19.824
You think Zane contacted me about drugs,
no?

What else is there?

25:21.595 --> 25:24.163

25:24.198 --> 25:27.433
The most infamous
cartel boss in history.

25:28.524 --> 25:32.104
Zane wanted the rights to your
life story... the El Oso biopic.

25:32.482 --> 25:35.139
He thought portraying me
would win him an Oscar.

25:35.175 --> 25:37.175
- So what happened?
- I said no.

25:37.210 --> 25:40.938
He may be big box office,
but the man cannot act.

25:40.991 --> 25:43.247
He got upstaged by a CGI aardvark

25:43.283 --> 25:46.284
in that <i>película De fantasía.</i>

25:46.319 --> 25:48.119
So I-I made him an ultimatum.

25:48.154 --> 25:51.021
You're the one who made him drop
"Safe Word" and do "Hamlet."

25:51.057 --> 25:53.022
I needed to see that he was serious.

25:53.058 --> 25:54.991
That he really could act.

25:55.026 --> 25:58.161
So I told him if he got a
good review in the <i> Times,</i>

25:58.197 --> 25:59.862
my life rights were his.

25:59.898 --> 26:03.600
But he had contact with you
before the show premiered.

26:03.635 --> 26:04.667
He wanted to meet again.

26:04.703 --> 26:05.535
- Why?
- I don't know.

26:05.571 --> 26:08.337
He said it had to do with the movie,

26:08.372 --> 26:11.373
but I could smell his, uh,
desperation through the phone,

26:11.409 --> 26:13.509
especially when I said no.

26:13.544 --> 26:15.311
And later that night, he was dead.

26:15.346 --> 26:17.313

26:38.535 --> 26:41.369
<i>Sí! Sí!</i> It will be fun!

26:41.404 --> 26:44.304
I-I will tell you all about myself.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.573
And then you will just typey,
typey, typey.

26:46.609 --> 26:50.177
It should only take six months,
maybe a year.

26:50.212 --> 26:51.478
And you will stay here with me!

26:54.750 --> 26:58.523
Or I will mail your body home...

26:59.720 --> 27:01.387
piece by piece.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.023
Esposito:
We got security footage from the garage,

27:04.058 --> 27:06.025
and it's not good.

27:06.060 --> 27:08.528
[Gasps] Oh, my...

27:08.563 --> 27:10.563
Oh, my God.

27:14.669 --> 27:16.534
The Escalade is
registered to a shell corp

27:16.570 --> 27:18.236
that's a known front for El Oso.

27:18.272 --> 27:20.072
You can track the SUV, can't you?

27:20.107 --> 27:24.042
We can, but they probably swapped
cars at least once by now,

27:24.078 --> 27:25.344
and with a two-hour head start,

27:25.379 --> 27:27.045
we're looking at a
100-mile search radius,

27:27.081 --> 27:29.147
and we still have no idea
what we're looking for.

27:29.183 --> 27:31.416
There must be something that you can do.

27:31.452 --> 27:33.184
This... This is Richard's life.

27:34.290 --> 27:35.552
YOLO.

27:35.588 --> 27:36.354
That's cold, Beckett.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.255
No, uh, Castle's new credit card.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.391
The kidnappers left his
cellphone by the car,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.559
but he might still have
his wallet with him.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.529
And the new YOLO card has
an upgraded RFID chip in it.

27:45.564 --> 27:47.931
And if they passed within range
of a tollbooth or a gas station...

27:47.967 --> 27:50.000
Then it'll pick up the chip,
and we'll be able to track his movement.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.067
All right,
I'll call the credit-card company,

27:51.103 --> 27:52.530
see if that card's pinged anywhere.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.458
Oh, poor Richard.

27:55.933 --> 28:00.243
I-I-I can't even imagine
how he must be suffering.

28:00.278 --> 28:01.744
[Both laugh]

28:01.779 --> 28:02.879
[Classical guitar plays]

28:02.914 --> 28:06.416
Your life is, without a doubt,
a Shakespearean drama.

28:06.451 --> 28:09.960
I've always felt a strong
connection to Macbeth.

28:10.369 --> 28:14.256
Ambitious but tortured
by his conscience.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.790
With your relationship to torture,

28:15.826 --> 28:17.259
I think you're a little
more Richard III,

28:17.294 --> 28:18.260
am I right? [Chuckles]

28:18.295 --> 28:19.261
[Dishes clatter]

28:19.296 --> 28:21.530
[Guitar stops]

28:21.565 --> 28:22.464
The hunchback?!

28:22.500 --> 28:23.298
[Gulps]

28:23.334 --> 28:25.299
I-I was thinking more along the lines

28:25.335 --> 28:26.100
of Sir Laurence Olivier.

28:26.136 --> 28:29.537
A man does not achieve what I have

28:29.572 --> 28:32.206
without great personal cost!

28:32.242 --> 28:33.274
Jorge, I-I only meant you...

28:34.177 --> 28:35.543
[Dishes shatter]

28:35.578 --> 28:37.278
Do you think I cannot see

28:37.313 --> 28:40.714
that the stains on my soul
appear upon my sleeve, as well?

28:40.750 --> 28:42.549
Are you the royal fool

28:42.584 --> 28:45.118
who dares believe he can
mock the king he serves?!

28:45.154 --> 28:47.320
No,
I'm just the funny kind of court jester.

28:47.356 --> 28:49.956
Then give me proof of your humility

28:49.991 --> 28:51.925
by giving me your life!

28:54.196 --> 28:57.130
[Laughs]

28:57.166 --> 28:59.331
Oh, Ricardo!

28:59.367 --> 29:02.401
I wish you could see your face!

29:02.437 --> 29:04.103
It's priceless!

29:04.138 --> 29:05.904
[Forced laugh] Yes, good one.

29:05.940 --> 29:08.340
Richard III had no sense of humor,

29:08.376 --> 29:09.608
but I do.

29:09.643 --> 29:13.179
These are the facets of...
of my character that you must capture.

29:13.214 --> 29:16.347
You know, you should really
play yourself in this movie.

29:16.383 --> 29:19.117
Oh, if only...

29:19.152 --> 29:22.787
But sadly, I'm a fugitive,

29:22.822 --> 29:25.690
persecuted and misunderstood.

29:25.725 --> 29:27.825
Until you tell my story, that is.

29:27.860 --> 29:30.428
Now [Claps hands] let's talk money, huh?

29:30.464 --> 29:31.463
[Snaps fingers]

29:37.303 --> 29:39.002
Will $5 million be enough?

29:39.037 --> 29:42.139
[Helicopter blades whirring]

29:42.174 --> 29:45.209
Agent Richmond: Jorge Zamacona,
this is the D.E.A.

29:45.244 --> 29:47.144
We have you surrounded.

29:47.179 --> 29:48.778
[Glass shatters] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, no, no, no!

29:48.814 --> 29:49.945
Jorge, wait, wait, wait!

29:49.981 --> 29:51.714
You remember how "Richard III" ended.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.483
You could write your own ending here.

29:53.518 --> 29:57.153
An artist must be true to
the material and himself.

29:57.188 --> 29:59.322
[Gunfire]

30:05.330 --> 30:07.329
[Gunfire continues]

30:18.575 --> 30:19.474
Aah!

30:21.578 --> 30:23.344
Open the hatch!

30:25.781 --> 30:26.980
[Glass shatters]

30:27.016 --> 30:29.383
[Gunfire continues]

30:39.395 --> 30:40.593
Man: Hey, over there!

30:40.629 --> 30:42.195
He's down! He's down!

30:43.532 --> 30:45.365
Three down. Castle's here.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.098
Are you hurt, Mr. Castle?

30:46.134 --> 30:48.201
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I...

30:49.604 --> 30:50.770
But I may not be for long.

30:52.147 --> 30:53.440
It was just instinct.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.260
He was running by, and I tripped him.

30:55.382 --> 30:57.749
- You did good, Castle.
- No, not good!

30:57.785 --> 30:58.917
I... Not good at all!

30:58.952 --> 31:01.619
I tripped a drug lord.

31:01.655 --> 31:02.520
It's my fault he got caught.

31:02.555 --> 31:05.189
The D.E.A. had the building surrounded.

31:05.224 --> 31:07.324
El Oso wasn't getting away,
even if you didn't trip him.

31:07.359 --> 31:09.960
Sadly, despite your abduction
being a fantastic story,

31:09.996 --> 31:12.496
we're still no closer to
finding out who killed Zane.

31:12.531 --> 31:13.798
Esposito:
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

31:13.833 --> 31:17.201
The D.E.A. confiscated a dozen
burner phones from El Oso's barn.

31:17.236 --> 31:19.369
One of those phones was the
one he used to call Zane

31:19.405 --> 31:20.304
the day he was killed.

31:20.339 --> 31:22.105
So they have Zane's burner phone number,

31:22.140 --> 31:24.340
which means we could find
out if he called anyone else.

31:24.375 --> 31:25.775
We can, and he did.

31:25.811 --> 31:27.310
An international line in Mexico,

31:27.345 --> 31:29.913
and you won't believe
who it belongs to...

31:29.948 --> 31:32.415
El Oso's younger brother,
Hector Zamacona,

31:32.450 --> 31:36.219
a legit businessman who publicly
condemns El Oso every chance he gets.

31:36.254 --> 31:38.688
If he's in Mexico,
how did Zane connect with him?

31:38.723 --> 31:41.156
Both ends of that call from Zane's phone

31:41.192 --> 31:42.590
pinged off of towers here in the city.

31:42.626 --> 31:43.826
Baby bro's in town.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.694
- Do we know where he is now?
- Not yet.

31:45.729 --> 31:46.528
Hector Zamacona might have been

31:46.563 --> 31:48.096
the last person to speak to Zane,

31:48.132 --> 31:49.932
which means he may know something.

31:49.967 --> 31:51.834
[Elevator bell dings]

31:51.869 --> 31:53.202
Esposito: Hey,
what's your wife doing here?

31:53.237 --> 31:55.204
I don't know. Excuse me.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.940
[Door closes]

31:58.975 --> 32:00.875
So, what's up?

32:00.910 --> 32:03.744
Ãlodie from the preschool
called about the play.

32:03.779 --> 32:06.881
It seems some of the parents
have some... concerns.

32:06.916 --> 32:10.918
Ah, yeah. Um, they're, uh,
struggling with my vision.

32:10.954 --> 32:12.553
I'll...
I'll call élodie in the morning.

32:12.588 --> 32:13.686
I'll walk her through it.

32:13.722 --> 32:16.489
Actually, they have decided
to go a different direction.

32:17.485 --> 32:19.726
Wait, they're firing me?

32:19.761 --> 32:21.862
The play's tomorrow.

32:21.897 --> 32:22.929
It's that élodie, isn't it?

32:22.965 --> 32:25.065
PTA's not enough for that mom-ster.
She has to...

32:25.100 --> 32:27.067
Kevin, it's all the parents.

32:27.102 --> 32:28.735
Oh.

32:28.770 --> 32:30.435
Everybody loves your enthusiasm.

32:30.471 --> 32:32.537
It's just, they're preschoolers.

32:32.573 --> 32:34.306
They're not Broadway stars.

32:34.342 --> 32:35.241
So no soft-shoe?

32:35.276 --> 32:37.743
No. No soft-shoe.

32:37.778 --> 32:39.444
- Okay.
- Come here.

32:39.480 --> 32:41.546
- [Whispering] It happens.
- Yeah.

32:42.443 --> 32:46.151
So, other than pissing
off a homicidal drug lord,

32:46.187 --> 32:48.452
how did you enjoy our
surprise date night?

32:48.488 --> 32:49.988
Are you saying you planned

32:50.023 --> 32:52.456
my abduction by a
fugitive cartel leader?

32:52.492 --> 32:55.726
Yeah, complete with the
daring rescue and everything.

32:55.762 --> 32:56.895
It was fun, huh?

32:56.930 --> 32:58.129
I don't think date night counts

32:58.164 --> 33:00.598
when it's a candlelit dinner
with the butcher of Guadalajara.

33:00.633 --> 33:02.733
Well, I'll... I'll plan something else.

33:02.769 --> 33:04.401
Something else?

33:05.319 --> 33:06.904
You didn't have a plan!

33:08.707 --> 33:09.606
[Sighs]

33:09.641 --> 33:11.841
Do you realize how
pressure-filled this is,

33:11.877 --> 33:13.643
always trying to top each other?

33:13.678 --> 33:15.345
That's half the fun of it.

33:15.381 --> 33:18.681
Our rivalry is what fuels
the passionate fire...

33:18.717 --> 33:19.983
- Rivalry.
- What?

33:20.019 --> 33:20.983
Rivalry.

33:21.019 --> 33:23.519
Between two brothers.

33:23.554 --> 33:25.421
What? What rivalry?

33:25.456 --> 33:27.423
The one between Jorge "El Oso" Zamacona

33:27.492 --> 33:28.491
and his brother, Hector.

33:28.526 --> 33:30.026
[Keyboard clacking]
A rivalry would explain

33:30.061 --> 33:31.494
why Zane was working with both brothers,

33:31.529 --> 33:32.428
but how... how do we prove it?

33:32.463 --> 33:35.464
I just need to find
one piece of evidence

33:35.500 --> 33:38.466
to see that I'm on the right track.

33:38.502 --> 33:41.670
And that could be it.

33:41.705 --> 33:43.639
All right, my Spanish is a little rusty,

33:43.674 --> 33:45.340
but my handy translator says...

33:45.375 --> 33:47.542
Hector Zamacona's been sleeping
with his brother's wife.

33:47.577 --> 33:48.877
They have been shacking up

33:48.912 --> 33:50.578
ever since El Oso went on the run.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.347
So Zane might have been caught

33:52.382 --> 33:54.049
in a rivalry between the brothers,

33:54.084 --> 33:55.716
and that's what got him killed.

33:55.752 --> 33:57.652
Hector wants more than
just El Oso's wife.

33:57.687 --> 33:58.585
According to the D.E.A.,

33:58.621 --> 34:00.821
all of his, uh,
"legitimate" businesses...

34:00.857 --> 34:02.422
They're suspected fronts
for money laundering.

34:02.458 --> 34:04.759
Esposito:
So with big brother on the run,

34:04.794 --> 34:07.594
Hector can make a play to
rule the family in his place.

34:07.630 --> 34:09.929
But Hector can never
truly own the throne

34:09.966 --> 34:12.598
until his brother is dead.

34:12.634 --> 34:15.568
A powerful family,
a cartel for a kingdom,

34:15.603 --> 34:17.603
two brothers locked in
a battle for control.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.839
Guys, this is just like the play.

34:19.875 --> 34:22.909
Hamlet's father is
killed by his brother,

34:22.944 --> 34:24.377
who then takes the throne

34:24.411 --> 34:26.411
and marries the dead brother's wife.

34:26.447 --> 34:28.514
There's a reason they
say Shakespeare endures.

34:28.550 --> 34:29.782
This is a real-life "Hamlet."

34:29.817 --> 34:31.784
Okay, so, thematic similarities aside,

34:31.819 --> 34:35.721
why would Hector need
Zane to take down El Oso?

34:35.755 --> 34:37.289
Because Hector didn't know
where to find his brother.

34:37.324 --> 34:40.525
And movie star Zane had a
face-to-face with El Oso.

34:40.561 --> 34:42.627
Making Zane the perfect Trojan Horse

34:42.663 --> 34:44.228
to lead Hector to his brother.

34:44.264 --> 34:45.097
Why would Zane agree to do that?

34:45.132 --> 34:47.899
He wanted to star in the El Oso movie.

34:48.918 --> 34:50.301
Money.

34:50.335 --> 34:51.902
Hector's worth hundreds of millions.

34:51.938 --> 34:54.605
Zane needed the money now,
not in three years,

34:54.639 --> 34:56.440
when the movie could get off the ground.

34:56.475 --> 34:59.610
So Hector offers to solve
Zane's money problems

34:59.645 --> 35:02.146
in exchange for Zane
leading him to El Oso.

35:02.182 --> 35:04.147
But El Oso refuses to meet with Zane.

35:04.183 --> 35:07.383
Then, rather than wait to see if Zane's
"Hamlet" reviews

35:07.419 --> 35:08.585
are good enough to meet with El Oso,

35:08.620 --> 35:11.054
Hector decides to cut his losses.

35:11.090 --> 35:14.257
Which, in this family,
translates to murder.

35:15.913 --> 35:18.840
My brother's bloody hand has
brought shame on our family.

35:19.081 --> 35:20.766
We're better off with
him back in a cage.

35:20.911 --> 35:22.849
Well, yeah, I mean,
you're definitely better off.

35:22.884 --> 35:25.951
You didn't even have to pay
for Zane Cannon's tax debts.

35:25.986 --> 35:28.520
[Chuckles] Why would I
pay a movie star's taxes?

35:28.555 --> 35:30.488
To get him to lead you to your brother.

35:30.524 --> 35:32.124
That way you could kill El Oso

35:32.159 --> 35:33.959
and take over the family business,

35:33.994 --> 35:37.229
much in the same way you
took over the family bed.

35:37.264 --> 35:39.965
And when Zane couldn't get a
second meeting with El Oso,

35:40.000 --> 35:41.499
he was a loose end, so you killed him.

35:41.535 --> 35:43.634
I did not kill Zane.

35:43.669 --> 35:45.502
We know that Zane called
you from a burner phone

35:45.538 --> 35:46.738
hours before he was killed.

35:46.773 --> 35:48.973
We also know that you put $15 million

35:49.008 --> 35:49.774
into a holding account.

35:49.809 --> 35:52.376
The exact amount of his tax bill.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.746
Let's say I did have a deal with him.

35:54.781 --> 35:57.348
Why would I kill him a week before
"Hamlet" previews?

35:57.383 --> 35:59.217
According to you,
good reviews would have gotten him

35:59.252 --> 36:00.550
another meeting with my brother.

36:00.585 --> 36:03.086
But that would have put
Zane out in the cold

36:03.122 --> 36:04.154
for his Oscar-winning role.

36:04.189 --> 36:06.223
And even with a big payoff,
it would have been tough

36:06.258 --> 36:08.158
to get him to walk away from that role.

36:08.193 --> 36:12.328
Unless you promised him
he could keep it anyway.

36:12.364 --> 36:13.196
With your brother dead,

36:13.232 --> 36:15.031
the life rights would revert to you.

36:15.067 --> 36:17.166
I could care less about
the El Oso biopic.

36:17.201 --> 36:19.769
I told him he could
direct it for all I cared.

36:19.804 --> 36:23.005
Wait, you... you told Zane

36:23.040 --> 36:25.374
he could star in and
direct his dream project?

36:25.409 --> 36:27.910
Only I guess Zane had
already promised the job

36:27.945 --> 36:29.444
to someone else...

36:29.480 --> 36:31.747
Someone who would not
be happy to lose it.

36:35.252 --> 36:38.352
O, woe is me.

36:38.388 --> 36:40.288
T'have seen what I have seen...

36:40.323 --> 36:43.724
No. Y-You've got to feel it more.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.127
This isn't just some guy who
broke up with you on Snapchat.

36:46.163 --> 36:48.963
Hamlet betrayed you.

36:48.999 --> 36:50.131
He... He never loved you.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.765
"Get thee to a nunnery," right?

36:51.801 --> 36:54.101
Hamlet took everything from you.

36:54.136 --> 36:55.936
That's certainly a
scene <i>you</i> can relate to,

36:55.971 --> 36:57.304
isn't it, Ms. Cherloff?

36:57.339 --> 36:58.972
Uh, this is a private rehearsal.

36:59.008 --> 37:01.608
We have a break in 20.
Can you let us finish?

37:01.643 --> 37:03.277
I think maybe you <i> are</i> finished.

37:03.312 --> 37:04.812
All due respect to the Bard,

37:04.847 --> 37:06.546
we're here with a tale of our own...

37:06.581 --> 37:09.481
One with betrayal and jealousy,
though sadly classic.

37:09.517 --> 37:11.984
A truly gifted director watches

37:12.020 --> 37:15.421
as her former classmate's
star rises in Hollywood,

37:15.456 --> 37:18.291
while she fought like hell
for every opportunity.

37:18.326 --> 37:20.626
I love what I do.

37:20.661 --> 37:22.761
So what if Zane made millions

37:22.797 --> 37:25.563
because he chose the
gym over acting school?

37:25.598 --> 37:26.531
I make art.

37:26.566 --> 37:29.734
But when Zane asked you
to cast him as Hamlet,

37:29.769 --> 37:31.169
you told him no, didn't you?

37:31.205 --> 37:33.138
Yes, until he convinced me
he was right for the part.

37:33.173 --> 37:37.075
By offering you your big break
directing the El Oso biopic?

37:37.110 --> 37:39.144
But it was a Hollywood promise.

37:39.179 --> 37:40.445
Not worth a damn.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.112
Tell me, did he confess to you

37:42.148 --> 37:43.981
that he would be directing
the picture on his own,

37:44.016 --> 37:45.950
or did he just tell
you you lost the job?

37:47.320 --> 37:49.086
Neither. [Scoffs]

37:49.121 --> 37:50.520
Because it didn't happen.

37:50.556 --> 37:54.124
I-I don't know anything
about an El Oso project.

37:54.160 --> 37:56.760
Then how do you explain the
browser history on your laptop?

37:56.795 --> 38:00.330
Or the shoes in your closet
with Zane's blood on them?

38:05.170 --> 38:06.435
[Scoffs]

38:06.471 --> 38:09.505
You have no idea what a risk it was

38:09.540 --> 38:11.140
putting Zane in this play.

38:11.176 --> 38:13.176
A-And the only thing
that made it worthwhile

38:13.211 --> 38:14.677
was directing that movie.

38:14.712 --> 38:17.479
A-And then he tells me that...
that he's gonna do it

38:17.514 --> 38:20.215
a-and I'm left with maybe
the worst production

38:20.251 --> 38:21.116
of "Hamlet" in history.

38:21.151 --> 38:23.685
I mean, my career is as good as over.

38:23.720 --> 38:27.189
Do you have any idea how
difficult it is as a woman

38:27.224 --> 38:28.891
to break into directing film?

38:28.926 --> 38:32.361
A-And he took away my
shot like it was nothing.

38:33.863 --> 38:36.063
I heard him that night

38:36.099 --> 38:38.232
torturing maybe the most beautiful words

38:38.268 --> 38:42.904
ever written for the stage,
and I just snapped.

38:42.939 --> 38:44.505
[Handcuffs clicking]

38:44.540 --> 38:46.140
This way, Ms. Cherloff.

38:48.644 --> 38:50.010
Is that a wrap on rehearsal?

38:50.045 --> 38:51.211
You still mad about being fired

38:51.246 --> 38:53.046
off Sarah Grace's preschool play?

38:53.082 --> 38:56.116
Ah, only at myself.
I swore I'd never be that dad.

38:56.151 --> 38:57.884
What,
the kind that makes an ass of himself

38:57.920 --> 38:59.853
by dancing around like a
flower for his daughter?

38:59.888 --> 39:01.554
No, the kind...

39:01.590 --> 39:02.956
the kind who gets caught
up in what he wants,

39:02.991 --> 39:04.057
not what his kid does.

39:04.093 --> 39:06.359
Yeah, okay, let's go.

39:06.394 --> 39:07.893
- Daddy!
- Hey!

39:07.929 --> 39:09.328
Look at my little sunflower!

39:09.363 --> 39:11.030
- [Laughing] Hey!
- Uncle Javi!

39:11.065 --> 39:12.331
Esposito: Ohh! Hey, baby.

39:12.366 --> 39:13.332
Hey. I was just leaving.

39:13.367 --> 39:14.800
Aren't you guys already
supposed to be there?

39:14.836 --> 39:16.135
Uh, she didn't want to go.

39:16.170 --> 39:19.004
Wouldn't say why. She just wants you.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.507
Uh... hey, sweetie.

39:22.543 --> 39:25.977
Look, y-you don't have to
sing if you don't want to.

39:26.012 --> 39:27.378
That's the law.

39:27.413 --> 39:29.347
But you'll be sad if I don't.

39:29.382 --> 39:31.382
What? No.

39:31.417 --> 39:33.017
[Whispering] I think it's
more she forgot the words.

39:33.053 --> 39:37.021
Oh, do... do you want me to
help you remember the words?

39:37.057 --> 39:39.090
Okay, I'll do it with you. Ready?

39:39.126 --> 39:41.558
Okay. Get your hands ready.

39:41.593 --> 39:44.061
Together: ♪ Flower, flower ♪

39:44.096 --> 39:46.130
♪ Flower fun ♪

39:46.165 --> 39:49.933

39:59.010 --> 40:00.076
[Applause]

40:00.111 --> 40:01.911
- Yay!
- Esposito: Yay!

40:01.946 --> 40:03.780
Hey!

40:03.815 --> 40:05.581
Nice!

40:05.616 --> 40:07.383
Yay!

40:07.418 --> 40:09.652
I think you're ready, S.G. All right?

40:09.687 --> 40:11.087
So we'll go to the play?

40:11.122 --> 40:12.655
- Yeah.
- She's ready.

40:12.690 --> 40:13.656
[Laughs] Yeah.

40:13.691 --> 40:15.390
This time I want to...

40:15.425 --> 40:17.525
Castle: Mmm! [Giggles]

40:22.332 --> 40:25.566
This date night is everything
I dreamed it would be.

40:25.602 --> 40:26.467
Aww.

40:26.503 --> 40:27.735
Well, given all the recent excitement,

40:27.771 --> 40:30.338
I thought that a quiet night
in would be nice for a change.

40:30.373 --> 40:33.107
[Knock on door]

40:33.142 --> 40:34.141
[Chuckling] Ohh!

40:34.177 --> 40:35.943
You <i> did</i> plan something. What is it?

40:35.978 --> 40:38.078
Flash mob, treasure hunt, land shark?

40:38.114 --> 40:40.080
No, no, I swear.
I don't know who's at the door.

40:41.350 --> 40:43.951
Oh. Thank you.

40:43.986 --> 40:46.086
Oh, no.
Castle, is that another credit card?

40:46.122 --> 40:47.988
Because I am YOLO'd out.

40:48.024 --> 40:49.923
Not a credit card.

40:56.798 --> 41:01.567
Script notes, biographical materials.

41:03.205 --> 41:04.637
It's from El Oso.

41:04.672 --> 41:06.371
Beckett, you know what this means?

41:06.406 --> 41:07.973
He still wants you to write his script.

41:08.008 --> 41:09.208
And he doesn't want me dead.

41:09.243 --> 41:10.475
Until he reads the first draft.

41:10.510 --> 41:11.443
Well, there's that.

41:11.478 --> 41:12.978
"These materials only cover

41:13.013 --> 41:14.546
the first two acts of our movie.

41:14.581 --> 41:16.048
[Cellphone rings]
The third act is yet to come,

41:16.083 --> 41:17.716
and it starts with a bang."

41:17.751 --> 41:19.051
Hey, Espo.

41:19.086 --> 41:20.585
Seriously?

41:22.089 --> 41:24.655
El Oso just escaped federal detention.

41:24.690 --> 41:25.964
What?!

41:26.333 --> 41:28.292
They should call this guy El Houdini.

41:28.328 --> 41:29.693
Hey, wait, Castle, where are you going?

41:29.729 --> 41:31.128
- Date night's not over yet.
- It is for me.

41:31.164 --> 41:32.463
I got to start writing this script.

41:32.498 --> 41:33.945
Typey, typey, typey!
