WEBVTT

00:12.040 --> 00:13.439
Now, I'm paying
for my mistakes.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.806
Promise me you won't tell Emma?
I need to be the one to do it.

00:15.810 --> 00:19.234
Your son... _
heis the one who seems to enjoy
draw/779 her covered in blood.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.810
Why did you go to him
without talking to me first?

00:21.820 --> 00:23.276
It was for
your own good, em.

00:23.280 --> 00:24.747
Then why do I feel
so betrayed?

00:24.750 --> 00:26.479
I really need you
to give me some space,

00:26.490 --> 00:28.219
or I don ’t know
what I ’m gonna do.

00:28.220 --> 00:30.780
You're in dire need
of some fun. Like, dinner.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.179
Emma:
Brooke, don ’t go down
the Branson spiral.

00:33.190 --> 00:36.887
Screw that! Take no prisoners
and kick ass as needed.

00:36.900 --> 00:39.755
Or say good-bye
to "little Branson."

00:39.770 --> 00:41.863
(Gasps)
Jk.

00:43.240 --> 00:46.391
(Muffled screaming)

00:49.980 --> 00:52.073
Man:
One of the teachers fell.
Its awful.

00:52.080 --> 00:55.106
How did you find this place?
I make up other lives,

00:55.120 --> 00:59.113
which in valves sneaking
into other people is houses.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.441
(Fire alarm beeping)

01:01.450 --> 01:03.088
VVhoa!
Oh, my god!

01:03.090 --> 01:06.218
This way! Come on!

01:07.130 --> 01:10.054
(Wheezing)

01:11.930 --> 01:16.060
Happy centennial
birthday, lakewood.

01:16.440 --> 01:17.896
Its that time again...

01:17.900 --> 01:21.461
77'me for lakewood’s
annual carn/val.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.358
What could be more twisted?

01:23.380 --> 01:26.269
Look, theres no denying
lakewood is opening the beaches

01:26.280 --> 01:28.805
with a man-eating shark
in the waters,

01:28.820 --> 01:30.299
but its what
the people want.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.118
_ We ’ve done it.
s/nce we were k/ds.

01:33.490 --> 01:35.811
When it comes
to murdervrlle,

01:35.820 --> 01:38.084
traditions die hard.

01:38.790 --> 01:41.759
So, start
the cotton candy spinning,

01:41.760 --> 01:45.992
set the t/lt-a-whir/
at full t/lt.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.319
The show must go on.

01:47.330 --> 01:50.788
The lady of the lake
must be crowned.

01:52.210 --> 01:55.930
Who can fault lakewood
for needing a little
folksy distraction

01:55.940 --> 02:00.206
from its harsh,
blood-stained reality?

02:08.820 --> 02:10.959
"No one will ever
forgive you"?

02:10.960 --> 02:13.827
Written in_b|ood
on my mirror.

02:13.830 --> 02:15.422
And "12 dead"?

02:15.430 --> 02:17.421
Tyler, Nina,
Rachel, Riley, will...

02:17.430 --> 02:20.490
The guard at Branson's cell,
Grayson, sheriff Hudson,

02:20.500 --> 02:22.422
Jake, Eddie, and...

02:22.440 --> 02:25.489
Piper. But that's still
one short of 12.

02:25.510 --> 02:27.068
He's trying to get
into your head.

02:27.070 --> 02:28.901
Trying? Noah, he's in there.

02:28.910 --> 02:31.504
You gotta take
your power back! You know?

02:31.510 --> 02:33.535
As long as you have this secret,
the killer owns you.

02:33.550 --> 02:36.348
You're right, okay?
You're right! I'm trapped!

02:36.350 --> 02:39.217
But, if Emma finds out
what I did, I might
as well as be dead.

02:39.220 --> 02:43.008
Tell Emma the truth
and you'll be free.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.594
Hey, can I talk to you?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.922
Sure.
Uh, in private?

02:59.540 --> 03:04.239
Is anyone else having
a hard time focusing
on physics right now?

03:07.910 --> 03:11.118
Do you think Ms. lang
really just fell?
Or was she pushed?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.987
(Chuckles) Doesn't fit
the killer's profile.

03:13.990 --> 03:18.415
Leaving the teacher
at the bottom of the stairs
where she landed...

03:18.420 --> 03:20.081
This guy's
too talented for that.

03:20.090 --> 03:23.582
There's no staging,
no big reveal, like...

03:23.600 --> 03:29.493
Actually, no need to speculate.
You were there. Right, Audrey?

03:30.900 --> 03:34.859
(Pa system dings)
Hello, students.
This is mayor Maddox.

03:34.870 --> 03:36.508
Many of your parents
have called with concerns

03:36.510 --> 03:38.535
about the Impending
lakewood days carnival.

03:38.540 --> 03:42.874
Your safety
is our primary concern,
but what we wﬂl not do...

03:42.880 --> 03:45.417
(School bell rings)
Is miss this town is
100th birthday.

03:45.420 --> 03:51.313
We have too much pride
and a rich history
of overcoming adversity.

03:51.930 --> 03:52.919
Or being killed.

03:52.930 --> 03:54.249
Hey, when he's right,
he's right.

03:54.260 --> 03:59.550
So, join me in this celebration
of courage and life, not fear.

03:59.570 --> 04:01.925
See you at the fairgrounds.
Eager to move on,

04:01.940 --> 04:05.592
a wounded and misguided town
concocts a flimsy excuse
to celebrate,

04:05.610 --> 04:08.909
which, in turn, instigates
yet another round of bloodshed.

04:08.910 --> 04:13.074
I mean, hasn't anybody
seen
my bloody Valentine
or
the prow/er
?

04:13.080 --> 04:14.672
Uh, I have not seen
the prow/er.

04:14.680 --> 04:16.375
Doesn't end well.
For anybody.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.476
This whole "hundred years
of perfect lakewood"
is some real bs.

04:20.490 --> 04:22.344
Brooke: Is it?

04:22.360 --> 04:24.954
Why don't we give
positivity a try, hm?

04:24.960 --> 04:26.382
That sounds like
a campaign slogan.

04:26.390 --> 04:29.154
Yeah, well, it beats
the crappy alternative.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.355
(Sighing)
I have to do
a speech tonight,

04:31.360 --> 04:33.499
so everybody get
in the mood and come.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.958
You know you have plenty
of reasons to bow out.

04:36.970 --> 04:40.963
I would, but my dad
is in high gear politically.

04:40.970 --> 04:46.169
He had a fire at one
of his real estate properties
last night, so he needs me to...

04:46.180 --> 04:49.547
Join him in this celebration
of courage and life?

04:49.550 --> 04:52.178
He_needs me
to smile and wave.

04:52.650 --> 04:56.279
Don't make me go through
this fiasco alone.

05:00.630 --> 05:04.498
Thank you.
This is everything
from lang's desk,

05:04.500 --> 05:06.957
and it's all been processed.

05:07.630 --> 05:09.996
That's a nasty fall.
Probably not an accident.

05:10.000 --> 05:14.403
Her office was ransacked.
Somebody was looking
for something.

05:14.410 --> 05:17.038
Photos, interview notes,
psych evaluations...

05:17.040 --> 05:19.406
What the hell
was this woman up to?

05:24.580 --> 05:29.347
(Knocking) Sheriff,
the arson squad is heading
out to wren lake estates.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.653
On my way. Go.

05:43.240 --> 05:47.700
We found the presence
of a large amount of accelerant.

05:47.710 --> 05:52.670
This fire was deliberate.
But this here is the kicker.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.185
Oh, my god.

06:11.200 --> 06:15.625
Deputy on radio:
Shen'ﬁj thereis someone
out here you need to see.

06:17.140 --> 06:18.562
On my way out.

06:23.580 --> 06:25.172
Eli:
I can't believe
we're even here.

06:25.180 --> 06:27.205
The sheriff said
that he was on our side,

06:27.210 --> 06:29.405
and I'm gonna choose
to believe him.

06:29.420 --> 06:32.742
Are you gonna come?
No, I'm good here.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.217
Okay.

06:36.590 --> 06:42.119
Emma. My deputy tells me
you might be able to help us
figure out what happened here.

06:42.130 --> 06:45.759
Yeah. I'm not keeping
secrets anymore.

06:50.600 --> 06:53.398
So, I just spoke to Eli.
Interesting kid.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.139
How long have you two
known each other?

06:55.140 --> 06:56.539
Uh, not long.
He just moved here.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.872
We, uh... he's Kieran's
cousin, actually.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.872
So, you two were
looking around, exploring.
I mean, I get it.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.769
It's a... it's a strange place,
that development.

07:04.780 --> 07:06.816
Just sitting there, empty.

07:06.820 --> 07:08.515
Did you check out
the whole place?

07:08.520 --> 07:11.557
No, we basically just stayed
in the living room.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.222
Did, uh, Eli go out,
maybe go back to his car?

07:14.230 --> 07:16.721
No. We were together
the whole time. Why?

07:16.730 --> 07:20.757
Well, we believe the fire
was set intentionally.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.788
We didn't start that fire.

07:26.710 --> 07:28.234
(Sighs)

07:29.140 --> 07:32.303
Look, Emma...
(Sighs)

07:32.310 --> 07:35.746
Your friend Eli...
He's been in trouble before.

07:35.750 --> 07:39.777
I know that.
There's a young woman
in Atlanta, about your age,

07:39.790 --> 07:41.917
who has a restraining order
out against him.

07:41.920 --> 07:47.278
Apparently, he likes
to go places he shouldn't.
This time, her bedroom.

07:48.260 --> 07:50.421
Um... he...

07:50.430 --> 07:52.751
(Scoffs)
There must be a mistake.

07:52.770 --> 07:55.796
If I were you, I'd be careful
who I hang outwith,

07:55.800 --> 07:57.199
especially these days.

07:57.200 --> 08:02.433
I wouldn't follow
a boy I barely knew
to an isolated location.

08:02.880 --> 08:06.805
Now, I might...
Be out of place here...

08:06.810 --> 08:09.802
But Kieran wilcox
wasn't rattIng on you.

08:09.820 --> 08:12.414
He was trying
to help you out.

08:14.190 --> 08:15.589
I know.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.453
My mom is waiting for me.
Are we done?

08:23.400 --> 08:24.697
Yeah.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.434
I'm proud of you.
You did the right thing.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.204
Thanks.
Can we talk?

08:35.210 --> 08:36.859
(Clears throat)
You okay?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.599
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

08:43.550 --> 08:46.246
I need you out there,
looking after Emma duval

08:50.590 --> 08:53.912
Hey. So, you were right.
On a scale of one to terrible,

08:53.930 --> 08:56.626
the cops are actually
pretty decent here.

08:56.630 --> 08:58.257
Yeah, not too bad.

08:58.260 --> 08:59.249
So, uh, what...

08:59.270 --> 09:01.921
What happened in there?
What'd you tell him?

09:01.930 --> 09:02.897
The truth.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.629
Yeah, but, like, we're okay?

09:04.640 --> 09:06.938
We're okay to go,
no big deal?

09:06.940 --> 09:11.309
Yeah, we can go,
but it was a big deal.

09:12.710 --> 09:14.348
You want to get lunch?

09:14.350 --> 09:18.411
My treat. You know,
to make up for all of this.

09:19.650 --> 09:22.244
Uh, I have to go home.

09:26.030 --> 09:29.955
So, what do you want from me?
I need you back on this case.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.621
I need you to identify
those bodies.

09:31.630 --> 09:34.360
I'm guessing they're victims
in the same murder spree

09:34.370 --> 09:35.962
that started with Jake.

09:36.700 --> 09:39.294
Now, this is that picture
of Emma at the pig farm.

09:39.310 --> 09:42.438
You know where
I'm going with this
and I need answers.

09:42.440 --> 09:45.307
For both of our children,
for all these kids,

09:45.310 --> 09:47.801
help me find this monster.

09:50.620 --> 09:54.841
Remember the three p's:
Poise, Polish, and pizzazz.

09:54.850 --> 09:59.981
Your speeches
for today's pageant should
be succinct and expletive-free.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.548
This isn't about winning.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.822
Well, it is about winning,

10:02.830 --> 10:05.651
but winning money
for your charity.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.291
(Sighs)

10:07.300 --> 10:08.699
What's wrong?

10:09.070 --> 10:12.335
I thought I could pull it off.
I thought it was my dream dress.

10:12.340 --> 10:15.366
(Exhales)
I think you thought wrong.

10:15.370 --> 10:17.770
I can't wear that onstage
in front an actual crowd

10:17.780 --> 10:19.771
with an actual boy
that I actually like.

10:19.780 --> 10:23.341
Too scary.
The only thing scary here
is this dress.

10:23.350 --> 10:27.741
Miss Maddox?
Let's focus. Please.

10:28.690 --> 10:29.816
As I was saying,

10:29.820 --> 10:31.617
the lady of the lake's
true reward

10:31.620 --> 10:36.580
is the gratification she feels
while hosting the quarterly
pancake breakfast,

10:36.600 --> 10:42.527
or while spearheading
the monthly lakewood
litter-removal initiative.

10:42.540 --> 10:46.738
Wait. The winner
of this competition
has to pick up trash?

10:46.740 --> 10:48.731
(Scoffs)
(Chuckles)

10:48.740 --> 10:51.732
I don't want
to win this thing.

10:55.650 --> 11:00.815
Wait. Let's make sure
you wm this thing.

11:02.790 --> 11:07.887
Okay, stavo, what have you
been telling Ms. lang?

11:08.760 --> 11:10.625
Lang:
Thatis why
you kept the bodies?

11:10.630 --> 11:12.450
Stavo:
Its a matter of perspective.

11:12.470 --> 11:15.667
Michelangelo needed subjects,
so he robbed gra ves.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.661
Art history
remembers mm as a god.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.934
But how is what he did
any more grotesque

11:19.940 --> 11:21.601
than someone l/ke ed gein?

11:21.610 --> 11:23.737
tang:
Edward gein wasn ’t
just a grave robber.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.002
He was a serial k/l/er.

11:25.010 --> 11:27.001
Stavo :
the I said.

11:27.010 --> 11:28.773
Perspective.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.828
What the hell
are you doing?
Where is it?

11:46.830 --> 11:48.491
Where's what?
You know damn well what.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.094
This is my room! You have
no right to be in here!
I'm your father!

11:51.100 --> 11:54.558
I'm responsible for you
and the lives of every
citizen in this town.

11:54.570 --> 11:57.937
So, I need to know,
where is the mask?

11:57.940 --> 11:59.976
What mask?
Stavo. ..

11:59.980 --> 12:01.675
We came here
for a fresh start,

12:01.680 --> 12:02.977
to put Phoenix behind us.

12:02.980 --> 12:04.709
I told you,
it was an accident.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.415
That's not
what I'm talking about.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.116
It's what you did
after the gun went off
that troubles me.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.109
He was my friend!

12:10.120 --> 12:13.817
I needed to remember
how it felt.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.650
It was important to me.

12:15.660 --> 12:17.719
It's always about your art.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.595
You really think
i carve people up

12:19.600 --> 12:21.625
and hang them up
like pieces of meat?

12:21.630 --> 12:23.894
That's who you think I am?

12:23.900 --> 12:28.132
If you think
I'm a killer... prove it.

12:28.140 --> 12:30.529
(Suspenseful music playing)

12:41.490 --> 12:43.845
Hey. I'm glad that you came.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.613
I was waiting
for you to call.

12:46.630 --> 12:48.029
I was mad and confused.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.749
Well, I told you why
i went to the sheriff.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.491
I was worried.
That hasn't changed.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.559
I know.

12:56.570 --> 12:57.719
But I have.

12:57.740 --> 12:59.628
I just came from the sheriff
and you were right.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.962
I can't keep things
from him or from you.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.129
I'm really sorry.

13:04.140 --> 13:09.578
You don't have to apologize.
I just want you to be safe.

13:09.580 --> 13:13.573
I know that
and it means so much.

13:14.920 --> 13:17.514
We're here to help
each other, right?

13:18.020 --> 13:19.487
Right.

13:19.490 --> 13:24.689
I think I understand why
you're so protective of me.

13:26.130 --> 13:27.757
I...

13:27.770 --> 13:30.523
Found out what happened
to your step-dad.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.735
What? From who?

13:32.740 --> 13:35.504
Eli told me.
What? What did he say?

13:35.510 --> 13:38.877
Just that you fought
with your parents
on the day that they died.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.646
That must've been so horrible,
to lose them like that.
He told you that?

13:42.650 --> 13:46.677
Yeah, and I understand
why you never told me,
but it explains so much.

13:46.690 --> 13:49.909
What else
did he say to you?
Just that.

13:49.920 --> 13:51.080
(Sighs)

13:51.090 --> 13:52.114
Hey, Kieran...

13:52.120 --> 13:55.089
It's not you. It's Eli.

13:55.090 --> 13:58.628
I don't want you
hanging out with him, okay?

13:58.630 --> 14:01.622
He's family,
but he's not right.

14:01.630 --> 14:04.758
Hey, hey.
I know, I know. This is...

14:04.770 --> 14:08.604
I just want us
to get back to normal.
So do I, but with Eli...

14:08.610 --> 14:12.728
This is about us,
not about him.

14:21.990 --> 14:23.742
(Phone dings, vibrates)

14:27.730 --> 14:32.850
(Suspenseful music playing)

14:35.130 --> 14:37.963
(Ringtone playing)

14:39.140 --> 14:42.132
What do you want?
Distorted voice:
I want to see what happens

14:42.140 --> 14:43.960
when she finds out the truth.

14:43.980 --> 14:47.734
Please don't.
You ’re nota vict/m, Audrey.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.741
You ’re a k/l/er.
Remember that.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.615
Call the cops? You ’re done.

14:51.620 --> 14:53.349
Confess to Emma? It’s over.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.581
Whatis left? Just me.

14:58.090 --> 14:59.853
Screw you!

15:05.200 --> 15:06.690
(Line ringing)

15:06.700 --> 15:11.797
Hello?
Hey, Emma, do you want to go
to the carnival with me?

15:21.150 --> 15:23.072
Carnival of cops.
Yeah, it's weird.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.174
The weirdest. And yet, also
the safest place in lakewood.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.579
Yeah. I'm glad
that you decided to come.

15:28.590 --> 15:30.581
I know you weren't
all "rah-rah lakewood days."

15:30.590 --> 15:32.979
Why did you change your mind?
I just wanted
to hang out with you.

15:32.990 --> 15:35.652
We haven't done anything,
just the two of us,
in a really long time.

15:35.660 --> 15:40.097
Yeah, and we've always done
the carnival together,
ever since we were little.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.763
Yeah. Well, you know,
except for last year.

15:43.770 --> 15:46.034
Let's just pretend
last year never happened.

15:46.040 --> 15:49.669
I'm just really glad
that we got over
that little breakup.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.171
Yeah, me too. What's up?

15:52.180 --> 15:56.048
Nothing. Okay, so what
do you want to do first?

15:56.050 --> 15:57.608
Tilt-a-whirl? Funhouse?

15:57.620 --> 16:02.114
Mm, funhouse, not so fun.
I have a better idea.

16:10.360 --> 16:14.319
(Chuckles)
I'm so good, it scares me.

16:14.330 --> 16:15.968
(Chuckles)

16:17.040 --> 16:20.362
Can I see?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, turn around.

16:22.070 --> 16:24.334
(Gasps, chuckles)

16:24.340 --> 16:26.274
Hello, gorgeous.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.340
Ithink... Ithink
i want to do a twirl.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.247
(Chuckles)

16:33.250 --> 16:36.947
I'm not gonna do a twirl,
if that's what you're asking.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.211
Okay.

16:38.220 --> 16:40.211
(Clears throat)
Uh, fun fact.

16:40.230 --> 16:42.084
Did you know
that public speaking

16:42.090 --> 16:44.354
is the_number_ one fear
In America?

16:44.360 --> 16:45.691
You? Seriously?

16:45.700 --> 16:48.089
Yeah, petrified.
And Noah's gonna be there.

16:48.100 --> 16:52.366
So, I may have brought
a little something
to take the edge off.

16:52.370 --> 16:53.837
Zoe!
You can't tell.

16:53.840 --> 16:58.174
(Gasps) Valedictorian
and secret self-medicator.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.875
I'm into it.

17:04.120 --> 17:06.918
There are not enough
happy face emojis in the world

17:06.920 --> 17:10.139
to express how much
i needed that.

17:11.190 --> 17:14.159
This little make-over
has momentarily lifted me

17:14.160 --> 17:16.754
out of my grief spiral, but...

17:17.730 --> 17:19.220
This whole pageant...

17:19.230 --> 17:22.393
Trying to act
like everything's normal
just feels...

17:22.400 --> 17:24.391
Like the most abnormal thing
in the world?

17:24.400 --> 17:27.062
Yeah, I know.
It's harder than I imagined.

17:27.070 --> 17:29.402
To twirling
even when it sucks.
Cheers to that.

17:29.410 --> 17:32.868
Woman:
I ’ve been flying
through the clouds alone

17:32.880 --> 17:36.202
looking for
somebody to hold

17:36.220 --> 17:37.699
you ’re here

17:37.720 --> 17:40.245
wow, this just got
a little more exciting.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.787
I keep on falling...

17:42.790 --> 17:44.087
Noah, what are you
doing here?

17:44.090 --> 17:48.186
I'm here to, uh, support
my favorite lady of the lake.

17:48.190 --> 17:53.150
And I figured
she needed a well-dressed,
color-coordinated date,

17:53.170 --> 17:54.296
um, as did Brooke.

17:54.300 --> 17:56.928
So, bow tie by miss Maddox,
but everything else...

17:56.940 --> 18:01.036
when we ’re done
with the world...

18:01.040 --> 18:03.463
yeah, so...
(Giggles)

18:03.480 --> 18:05.129
Thank you.

18:05.940 --> 18:07.737
Catch you later.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.048
If you meant forever

18:10.050 --> 18:11.813
then look at me now

18:11.820 --> 18:13.515
look at me and say. . .

18:13.520 --> 18:16.444
whoo! Brooke did not
have any din-din.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.315
(Suspenseful music playing)

18:32.300 --> 18:35.167
Hey.
Hey! How'd you get
back here?

18:35.170 --> 18:38.059
Thought you could use
some company. I know I could.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.968
They're being
green room Nazis back here.

18:39.980 --> 18:43.905
They're not letting anyone back
unless they're in the pageant.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.218
So, let's go.
Let's get out of here.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.471
As in, leave?
Why not?

18:47.490 --> 18:49.412
Get your stuff.
Your dad will be fine.
He'll survive.

18:49.420 --> 18:53.208
You think I'm doing
this for my dad?
That's what you said, right?

18:53.230 --> 18:56.984
He thinks he can control you,
but he doesn't even know you.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.363
I'm doing this
because I want to.

19:02.370 --> 19:06.329
Honestly? Because
this is the stupidest,
most insane thing ever.

19:06.340 --> 19:10.299
Having a carnival
after everything that's
happened in this town?

19:11.110 --> 19:14.102
Brooke! Tell me I'm wrong.

19:14.110 --> 19:18.342
Stavo, I'm gonna do
the pageant. Okay?

19:18.350 --> 19:20.511
I have my reasons.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.283
If all you're gonna do
is judge me for it,

19:22.290 --> 19:25.259
then why don't you
just leave?

19:25.260 --> 19:27.148
If that's what you want.

19:32.330 --> 19:33.854
(Sighs)

19:44.110 --> 19:46.101
(Giggling)

19:46.110 --> 19:47.998
That was so good!

19:48.010 --> 19:50.149
Hey, Emma. Can we talk?

19:50.150 --> 19:51.174
Uh... what?

19:51.180 --> 19:56.345
I, uh, just wanted to know
what the sheriff said
that made you so upset.

19:57.120 --> 20:00.612
Okay, after that fire...
you don't think I started
the fire, though, do you?

20:00.630 --> 20:05.294
Wait, what fire?
No, I don't think
you started the fire.

20:05.860 --> 20:09.159
But the sheriff told me
what happened in Atlanta...

20:09.170 --> 20:11.525
And that made me realize
that I don't know you at all.

20:11.540 --> 20:13.428
Look, I have made mistakes,

20:13.440 --> 20:15.305
yes, but I'm not
a bad guy, okay?

20:15.310 --> 20:18.029
Can I get a chance
to explain, please?

20:18.040 --> 20:19.302
Now's not the right time.

20:19.310 --> 20:24.247
Emma, wait. I would never
do anything to hurt you, okay?

20:24.250 --> 20:25.569
Get off her!
Back off, dude.

20:25.580 --> 20:27.241
This is not your business.

20:27.250 --> 20:28.547
I'm making it my business.

20:28.550 --> 20:31.041
Let's not do this right now.
Okay? Please?

20:31.060 --> 20:33.949
Stay away from her.
Stop telling stories.

20:33.960 --> 20:37.623
Don't worry, Kieran.
It's not like I told her
the worst part.

20:40.030 --> 20:41.895
(Crowd gasping)

20:42.330 --> 20:44.366
Kieran! Kieran! Kieran!

20:44.370 --> 20:47.134
Stop it!
What are you doing?

20:50.210 --> 20:55.477
You see, Emma?
I'm not the one
you should be afraid of.

21:03.990 --> 21:07.016
Woman on mic: Check, one, two.
Check, check. One, two.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.851
(Chuckles)
You have some cotton candy
on your face.

21:09.860 --> 21:13.296
Oh, I do? Really?
Where? Where is that?

21:13.870 --> 21:16.191
Got it.
You sure? I think, actually,
there was some more.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.192
Oh, wow! Look! I love these!
Come on! I need photographic
proof of that bow tie!

21:19.200 --> 21:23.000
Okay.
Man:
chase the things
that wﬂl let your mind

21:23.010 --> 21:28.471
flow freely
in and out of time

21:28.480 --> 21:32.871
this feeling
we ’re chasing

21:32.880 --> 21:36.486
oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, I l/ke it

21:36.490 --> 21:40.449
this feeling
we ’re chasing

21:40.460 --> 21:43.884
oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, I l/ke it

21:43.900 --> 21:45.492
(muttering)

21:45.500 --> 21:48.128
Wow!
I'm sorry. This isn't
the right place.

21:48.130 --> 21:51.588
No, no. Well, somewhere
with a door would be optimal.

21:51.600 --> 21:54.467
I don't know
what I was thinking.
I like what you were thinking.

21:54.470 --> 21:58.133
We should keep
that brainstorm going.

21:58.140 --> 21:59.937
Woman on mic:
tad/es and gentlemen,

21:59.950 --> 22:02.874
the lady of the lake pageant
wﬂ/ begin shortly.

22:02.880 --> 22:04.905
Please join us at the stage.

22:04.920 --> 22:08.071
What? Ms. Buckley
isn't a turn-on?

22:09.050 --> 22:11.382
(Line ringing)

22:11.390 --> 22:13.085
Still not answering?

22:13.090 --> 22:15.581
No. I don't know.
What do I do?

22:15.590 --> 22:18.127
I've never seen Kieran
like that before.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.449
It was pretty brutal.

22:19.460 --> 22:21.894
Seriously. And Eli's,
like, half Kieran's size.

22:21.900 --> 22:24.994
I know, okay?
But he and Eli have issues.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.107
Also, Eli's not an angel.
He's the one who started
that fight.

22:32.340 --> 22:34.934
Okay, I'm not supposed
to tell anybody this, but...

22:34.950 --> 22:38.579
The sheriff told me
that Eli has a restraining
order against him.

22:38.580 --> 22:42.949
Apparently,
he broke into some girl's
bedroom in Atlanta.

22:42.950 --> 22:45.111
That's completely insane.

22:50.600 --> 22:51.953
Okay, look, uh...

22:51.960 --> 22:54.019
There's something I really
need to tell you, but, uh...

22:54.030 --> 22:57.022
We should definitely get
someplace more private first.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.429
Okay.
Let's go.

23:00.110 --> 23:01.634
Look, I didn't want
to freak you out earlier,

23:01.640 --> 23:04.438
but, last night,
someone snuck into my room
while I was sleeping.

23:04.440 --> 23:06.078
Wait, what?
I woke up this morning,

23:06.080 --> 23:08.708
and there were creepy messages
written on my mirror
and my ceiling.

23:08.710 --> 23:10.268
Oh, my god.
What did they say?

23:10.280 --> 23:12.145
Dumb, creepy message stuff,
like "I'm watching you."

23:12.150 --> 23:14.948
It doesn't matter.
Now all this stuff
about Eli...

23:14.950 --> 23:16.281
Do you think
he could be doing this?

23:16.290 --> 23:18.087
Could he be doing
all of this?

23:18.090 --> 23:19.409
I...

23:19.420 --> 23:22.184
I mean, someone
snuck into my house

23:22.190 --> 23:23.623
to send those emails
to my dad.

23:23.630 --> 23:26.258
And now that we know this
is the sort of thing Eli does,

23:26.260 --> 23:31.323
you have to wonder if he
could be the one who keeps
sneaking into our rooms.

23:33.210 --> 23:34.199
Oh, my god.

23:34.210 --> 23:36.007
So, in the end,
i guess you could say

23:36.010 --> 23:39.229
that small towns
are a great place
to launch big futures.

23:39.240 --> 23:43.301
And that is why I love
lakewood. Thank you.

23:50.620 --> 23:51.746
Yeah!

23:51.760 --> 23:54.183
Buckley:
And that was Zoe l/aughn.

23:54.190 --> 23:55.555
Thank you, Zoe!

23:55.560 --> 23:57.289
Oh, my god!
That was such a kick!

23:57.300 --> 24:02.465
Oh, I'm so glad.
I knew you could do it. Mm.

24:02.470 --> 24:04.722
Oh, no.
I look like roadkill.

24:04.740 --> 24:08.369
You look fine.
Let me just fix this.

24:08.370 --> 24:12.079
Empty.
Please give a warm welcome
for Brooke Maddox.

24:12.080 --> 24:15.004
(Cheers and applause)
Mm, that's me!

24:15.380 --> 24:17.245
Are you sure you're okay
to go out there?

24:17.250 --> 24:19.309
Totally!
You're sure?

24:19.320 --> 24:22.448
20, I have things
that I need to say.

24:22.450 --> 24:25.510
If I don't say them now,
I'll never say them.

24:34.470 --> 24:35.767
Whoo!

24:42.310 --> 24:44.437
I, um...
I had a speech prepared

24:44.440 --> 24:48.399
that I, uh...
I worked on with my dad.

24:48.410 --> 24:49.570
Hi, daddy!

24:49.580 --> 24:54.244
But, uh... Ithink
I'm just gonna wing it.

24:56.490 --> 25:00.517
Look at us...
HaVIng a carnival...

25:00.530 --> 25:02.350
Making speeches...
Is she drunk?

25:02.360 --> 25:06.353
Either that, or she's recently
suffered a blow to the head.
She's drunk.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.820
I just wanted
to get real for a second.

25:10.840 --> 25:14.298
Some of you
probably know I was...

25:14.310 --> 25:19.634
Supposed to be here
tonight with my boyfriend,
Jake Fitzgerald.

25:19.640 --> 25:23.474
But I guess we all know
what happened with that, right?

25:29.450 --> 25:31.088
I...

25:32.860 --> 25:34.782
I miss him so much.

25:37.500 --> 25:39.127
But...

25:39.130 --> 25:42.190
I mean, Jake had
a great sense of humor.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.828
This all just feels
so appropriate,

25:44.840 --> 25:47.695
'cause this carnival's a joke!

25:50.240 --> 25:51.434
Congratulations, lakewood.

25:51.440 --> 25:55.649
Happy one hundred years
of lying to yourself!

25:55.650 --> 25:57.868
Lakewood is cursed.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.713
People die in this town.

26:01.550 --> 26:03.381
All the time.

26:04.120 --> 26:06.657
And we act like nothing
happened. I almost died.

26:06.660 --> 26:09.288
And thank you very much...
No! I'm not done.

26:09.290 --> 26:11.656
And you know what I saw?

26:11.660 --> 26:13.389
Nothing!

26:14.800 --> 26:16.859
No white light.

26:17.740 --> 26:22.803
Just big, black,
empty nothing.

26:24.310 --> 26:28.132
And that's where
Jake is right now!

26:28.710 --> 26:34.717
Instead of up here,
with me, where he belonged.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.812
Unless we wake up

26:37.820 --> 26:40.857
and stop acting like
this isn't murderville,

26:40.860 --> 26:44.182
we're all gonna
end up like Jake.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.498
And we'll deserve it.

26:49.600 --> 26:51.568
But he didn't.

26:52.740 --> 26:54.867
(Microphone feedback)

26:54.870 --> 26:58.169
Buckley: Let's hear it for...
We should go get her.

26:58.180 --> 26:59.499
Yeah, let's go.

26:59.510 --> 27:03.207
Here's a preliminary report
on the burn victims.

27:03.210 --> 27:05.417
Both adult males,
20 to 30 years old.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.217
Given the relative states
of decompOSItlon,

27:07.220 --> 27:12.613
I'd say the first victim
died hours, maybe days
before the fire.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.487
Cause of death:
Stab wound to the neck.

27:15.490 --> 27:17.651
And the other one?

27:18.500 --> 27:20.491
We got a positive ID on him.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.628
Seth Branson. His prints
were in the system.

27:23.640 --> 27:25.392
I got a match
off his left index finger,

27:25.400 --> 27:27.493
which was fortunate
because his right hand

27:27.510 --> 27:29.603
was severed at the wrist.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.232
Anything else?

27:33.240 --> 27:36.607
No, that's it.
I'll keep you posted.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.280
(Door closes)
(Sighs)

27:58.270 --> 28:02.730
(Suspenseful music playing)

28:06.210 --> 28:08.508
I don't know,
but it was kind of awesome.
Kind of?

28:08.510 --> 28:10.569
You just read
the entire town
the riot act

28:10.580 --> 28:14.072
for having a beauty pageant
instead of a funeral.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.489
Nicely done,
Brooke Maddox.

28:15.490 --> 28:18.584
Oh, my god, Brooke.
Drink this.

28:20.990 --> 28:23.049
How did you get so drunk?

28:23.060 --> 28:24.527
I gave her a shot
and I didn't really...

28:24.530 --> 28:27.249
Hey, I got myself drunk.
Thank you.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.465
Brooke! Honey,
what were you thinking?

28:29.470 --> 28:33.031
What can I say, dad?
It was the truth.

28:35.070 --> 28:37.538
Jake would have liked
that speech.

28:37.540 --> 28:41.237
Oh, honey...
Honey... come on.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.445
Let's get you home.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.247
(Phone vibrates)

28:51.490 --> 28:53.481
Wait, you brought alcohol?

28:53.490 --> 28:54.582
It was for my nerves.

28:54.590 --> 28:59.220
You've had nothing
to be nervous about.
That speech was amazing.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.198
Okay, so we'll...

29:03.440 --> 29:06.261
(carnival music playing)

29:13.610 --> 29:16.579
Man on pa system:
The park W/l/ be closing
in 30 minutes.

29:16.580 --> 29:18.172
Please find the closest exit.

29:18.180 --> 29:22.139
(Phone ringing)
Thank you for coming
to the lakewood days carnival.

29:22.150 --> 29:25.381
See you tomorrow.I
Hey! Uh, where are you?

29:25.390 --> 29:28.587
Distorted voice:
I l/ked your friend is speech.

29:28.590 --> 29:30.455
A real knife to the gut.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.394
Where's Kieran? Where...

29:32.400 --> 29:36.029
Where's Kieran?
What did you do to him?
He loves you, Emma.

29:36.030 --> 29:37.725
Thatis enough
to get h/m hurt isn ’t it?

29:37.740 --> 29:41.039
Take a look at your phone.
(Phone dings)

29:41.440 --> 29:45.706
(Muffled screaming)

30:01.490 --> 30:02.388

30:02.390 --> 30:05.655

30:28.690 --> 30:30.487
(Phone dings, vibrates)

30:35.490 --> 30:36.752
Ugh!

31:04.660 --> 31:08.812
(Automated quacking)

31:12.860 --> 31:17.263
(Automated quacking)

31:23.840 --> 31:25.398
(Clanging)

31:28.250 --> 31:29.547
Kieran?

31:32.920 --> 31:34.478
Kieran?

31:35.650 --> 31:37.618
(Automated laughter)

31:37.620 --> 31:40.885
(Laughter continues)

31:42.590 --> 31:44.353
I hate clowns.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.760

31:49.900 --> 31:52.562

32:12.490 --> 32:16.324
Acosta:
Dwayne, you st/l/
have eyes on Emma duval?

32:17.200 --> 32:18.758
Affirmative, sheriff.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.599
Kieran!

32:28.740 --> 32:33.575
(Horn blaring,
train bell ringing)

32:36.480 --> 32:37.902
Kieran!

32:42.390 --> 32:44.517
(Gasps)

32:47.660 --> 32:50.879
Oh, my god.
(Groaning)

32:52.960 --> 32:56.225
(Automated laughter)

33:05.640 --> 33:08.404
(Muffled moaning)

33:14.650 --> 33:16.641
(Siren blaring)

33:17.790 --> 33:20.258
Male officer:
All right, stay back.

33:21.960 --> 33:23.552
Get these people back.

33:23.560 --> 33:25.027
(Suspenseful music playing)

33:25.030 --> 33:27.999
Drop the weapon!
I said, drop the weapon!
(Muffled moaning)

33:28.000 --> 33:31.822
Get down on your knees!
Down on your knees, now!

33:31.840 --> 33:33.637
(Muffled moaning)

33:35.270 --> 33:37.329
Emma, drop the weapon.

33:37.340 --> 33:40.400
Where's Kieran?
Where's Kieran?!

33:40.410 --> 33:41.934
Emma, listen to me. Emma...

33:41.950 --> 33:45.943
Emma, step back
and drop the weapon.

33:45.950 --> 33:48.942
That's right.
Put down the gun.

33:51.860 --> 33:55.011
Put your hands
on your head! Now!

33:57.800 --> 33:59.290
Take him.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.434
(Gasps)
Oh, my god! Kieran!

34:14.950 --> 34:15.871
Kieran!

34:15.880 --> 34:18.405
Oh, my god! Kieran!

34:39.800 --> 34:43.099
I don't know what to say.
It's not your fault.

34:43.940 --> 34:45.771
Ithought
he'd killed you in there.

34:45.780 --> 34:48.999
He lost tonight. We won.

34:49.010 --> 34:51.706
Why do I feel
so horrible, then?

34:51.720 --> 34:54.871
When I was in there,
i thought I was gonna die.

34:54.890 --> 34:58.815
You were never
gonna know the truth.
What are you talking about?

34:58.820 --> 35:02.927
The reason I was fighting
with Eli, everything...

35:06.730 --> 35:10.564
I was in the car
the night my parents died.

35:11.970 --> 35:17.567
I got into a fight
with my step-dad.
He got so mad...

35:17.580 --> 35:19.104
And he took his eyes
off the road...

35:19.110 --> 35:22.671
Kieran. ..
I caused the accident.

35:22.680 --> 35:25.774
And it's on me.
I carry that around.

35:25.780 --> 35:28.874
No. No, that is
not your fault.

35:28.890 --> 35:32.587
Just like tonight
isn't your fault.

35:35.730 --> 35:37.755
Why didn't you
tell me about that?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.694
I wanted to.

35:40.730 --> 35:43.858
It was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

35:43.870 --> 35:48.466
When I found out
Eli may have told you,

35:48.470 --> 35:49.801
I lost it.

35:49.810 --> 35:52.131
Why did he do that?

35:52.140 --> 35:56.577
'Cause anything good
in my life, Eli tries to take.

35:56.580 --> 35:58.707
And you're the best thing.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.139
I don't want
to lose you, ever.

36:19.070 --> 36:21.595
The killer sent me
a clip of Emma going
in the funhouse.

36:21.610 --> 36:25.467
He obviously wanted you to know
what he was doing to Emma.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.936
He wanted me
to feel responsible.

36:26.940 --> 36:29.170
He wanted me
to be responsible

36:29.180 --> 36:31.171
for whatever happened.

36:31.180 --> 36:35.173
It's all on me!
Everything is my fault!

36:39.820 --> 36:41.253
No, I'm done. I am done!

36:41.260 --> 36:44.081
I am not gonna do
what he wants anymore.

36:44.100 --> 36:48.548
I'm gonna tell Emma.
I'm gonna tell her
everything tonight.

36:56.870 --> 37:00.169
Congratulations,
lady of the lake.

37:01.080 --> 37:04.800
Seems pretty silly now.
How's Kieran?

37:04.820 --> 37:07.744
He's gonna be fine.
And it's not silly.

37:07.750 --> 37:11.709
You went after something
you wanted and you got it.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.878
No interruptions.
Okay.

37:42.950 --> 37:45.180
(Phone ringing)

37:45.190 --> 37:47.750
Sorry.
That's okay.

37:47.760 --> 37:48.988
(Ringing continues)

37:48.990 --> 37:53.029
Are you gonna get that?
No, no. I am...
I'm in this right now.

37:53.030 --> 37:55.089
(Ringing continues)

37:55.100 --> 37:59.867
You should probably get that.
I'm just not even
gonna look at it.

37:59.870 --> 38:00.894
Is it Audrey?

38:00.910 --> 38:03.003
I mean, yeah,
but she's just...

38:03.010 --> 38:05.899
She's been going through
a lot tonight, so...

38:07.140 --> 38:10.871
Okay, you know,
maybe we should just wait.

38:10.880 --> 38:16.887
A lot has been going on...
Zoe, we don't have to worry
about anybody else, right?

38:16.890 --> 38:22.010
But we do and you do.
I think I just need to leave.

38:22.030 --> 38:24.988
I'm gonna go.
Wait, you're just leaving?

38:25.000 --> 38:26.297
Yeah.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.757
We'll know when it's right.
It's not now.

38:28.770 --> 38:33.639
It's okay, Noah, really.
It's okay.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.200
(Door opens, closes)

38:41.180 --> 38:43.774
(Suspenseful music playing)

39:04.770 --> 39:06.362
Thanks for coming.

39:24.920 --> 39:29.016
Noah's voice:
Test/ng, test/ng.
Welcome to the morgue.

39:34.970 --> 39:37.666
I thought you
were going home.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.963
Audrey's voice:
I was...

39:39.970 --> 39:42.359
But if] don’t tell you
this tonight

39:42.370 --> 39:44.804
I may never be able to.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.411
Noah:
Okay, go.

39:58.860 --> 40:02.159
Au d rey :
I know why the k/l/er
is after me.

40:02.960 --> 40:05.121
He knows what I ’ve done...

40:05.130 --> 40:09.760
And that] would do anything
to keep it secret.

40:13.770 --> 40:17.103
I brought Piper to lakewood

40:19.240 --> 40:20.878
I can explain.
