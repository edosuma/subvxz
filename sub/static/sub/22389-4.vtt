[jazz music]

00:04.000 --> 00:12.000
â™ª â™ª

00:20.000 --> 00:23.170
- From the Penn & Teller
Theater in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:23.170 --> 00:26.329
here's our host
Alyson Hannigan!

00:26.329 --> 00:29.329
[cheers and applause]

00:29.329 --> 00:34.530
â™ª â™ª

00:34.530 --> 00:35.729
- [quietly]
Thank you.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.229
Welcome to "Fool Us."

00:39.229 --> 00:41.170
When I found out
I was gonna work

00:41.170 --> 00:43.170
with magic legends
Penn and Teller

00:43.170 --> 00:45.070
I got very excited.

00:45.070 --> 00:47.429
I wanted to ask 'em
all the questions

00:47.429 --> 00:49.729
they probably heard
a million times, like,

00:49.729 --> 00:52.700
"Well, how do you make this
or that disappear?"

00:52.700 --> 00:54.729
Believe me,
ever since "American Pie"

00:54.729 --> 00:56.429
people have asked me,

00:56.429 --> 00:59.100
"Ooh, well, how did you make
a certain flute disappear?"

00:59.100 --> 01:01.399
[laughter]
Yeah.

01:01.399 --> 01:05.069
Yep, even when I'm with my kids.

01:05.069 --> 01:07.030
Good times.

01:07.030 --> 01:09.730
Well, you're gonna have
really good times

01:09.730 --> 01:12.370
with the next illusionists
that we have tonight.

01:12.370 --> 01:14.569
They're gonna put
Penn and Teller to the test

01:14.569 --> 01:17.700
and try to win a spot performing
in their famous show

01:17.700 --> 01:19.230
here in Las Vegas.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.900
And now, for my next trick,

01:21.900 --> 01:24.900
I'm gonna make
the stars of our show appear.

01:24.900 --> 01:28.069
Penn and Teller!

01:28.069 --> 01:31.069
[cheers and applause]

01:31.069 --> 01:34.329
â™ª â™ª

01:34.329 --> 01:36.729
Oh, thank you.

01:36.729 --> 01:39.099
Take your seats.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.500
All right, let's meet
the first act that's gonna try

01:46.500 --> 01:48.729
to fool Penn and Teller.

01:48.729 --> 01:50.930
[firework explodes]

01:50.930 --> 01:52.530
- I'm David...
- And I'm Leeman.

01:52.530 --> 01:55.729
- And we're a magic...
- Duo.

01:55.729 --> 01:58.030
- We met in Santa Monica.
- We were street performing.

01:58.030 --> 01:59.569
It's great being
in a comedy team

01:59.569 --> 02:01.870
because you have somebody else
up there on stage with you,

02:01.870 --> 02:03.700
you know, to look stupid with.

02:03.700 --> 02:05.170
- Sometimes people would
compare us

02:05.170 --> 02:06.900
to Penn and Teller,
which was an honor.

02:06.900 --> 02:09.370
He has nightmares about this.
- I can't get it out of my head.

02:09.370 --> 02:10.598
- Penn.
- Teller.

02:10.598 --> 02:12.069
- Penn.
- Teller.

02:12.069 --> 02:13.729
Everything you know is wrong.

02:13.729 --> 02:14.729
[distorted voice]
Penn...

02:14.729 --> 02:15.729
- [distorted voice]
Teller.

02:15.729 --> 02:16.729
- Penn.
- Teller.

02:16.729 --> 02:18.000
- [laughs evilly]
- Teller.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.699
both: No!
[breathing heavy]

02:19.699 --> 02:22.030
- So we came to the only
conclusion we could think of.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.270
- We have to take them out.

02:23.270 --> 02:25.870
[dramatic music]

02:25.870 --> 02:27.069
- Not kill 'em.
- No, no, no, no...

02:27.069 --> 02:29.030
- No, fool 'em.
both: Fool 'em, yeah.

02:29.030 --> 02:32.030
[cheers and applause]

02:33.599 --> 02:35.770
- These next two magicians
might be

02:35.770 --> 02:37.770
the Lennon and McCartney
of magic,

02:37.770 --> 02:39.729
which means they're just
a few years away

02:39.729 --> 02:41.599
from hating each other.

02:41.599 --> 02:45.199
Welcome the harmonious duo
David and Leeman.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.030
[cheers and applause]

02:47.030 --> 02:48.370
- Hey, hey...
- Oh.

02:48.370 --> 02:50.099
- Restraining order.
- Oh, right.

02:50.099 --> 02:51.329
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- That's good.

02:51.329 --> 02:52.670
Welcome, thank you very much.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.270
Uh, we're very honored
to be here tonight.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.069
Uh, we knew we were gonna be on
the show about three months ago,

02:57.069 --> 02:59.699
so, naturally,
we are totally unprepared.

02:59.699 --> 03:01.569
- And I don't know
if this is gonna work,

03:01.569 --> 03:03.930
but tonight we're gonna show you
a rope trick.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.270
- But first,

03:05.270 --> 03:06.930
in a desperate attempt
to fill time,

03:06.930 --> 03:08.169
we're gonna teach you
some things

03:08.169 --> 03:09.569
with a deck of cards.

03:09.569 --> 03:10.900
- So if anybody has
a deck of cards,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.370
feel free to bring it out,
follow along.

03:12.370 --> 03:14.530
We'll wait.
[laughter]

03:14.530 --> 03:15.830
Maybe just take notes.
- Just take notes.

03:15.830 --> 03:17.000
That sounds good.
[laughter]

03:17.000 --> 03:18.569
I will show you
a professional version.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.099
- And I will show you
the beginners version.

03:20.099 --> 03:21.500
- Here's the very first thing.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.770
This is your classic
in the hands riffle shuffle...

03:24.770 --> 03:25.829
and bridge.

03:25.829 --> 03:26.870
A lot of people know this one.

03:26.870 --> 03:28.229
In case you don't.

03:32.069 --> 03:33.569
[laughter]

03:33.569 --> 03:34.569
- It's a lot harder
than it looks.

03:34.569 --> 03:35.729
- It's true.
It's true.

03:35.729 --> 03:37.099
Here's something
a little more difficult.

03:37.099 --> 03:39.930
This is a one-handed shuffle.

03:41.500 --> 03:43.829
- Ooh.
- All righty.

03:43.829 --> 03:45.000
audience: Ooh.
- Ooh.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.400
- It's also know as
a lonely Saturday night.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.069
[laughter]

03:49.069 --> 03:50.099
- I can do some shuffles too.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.729
This is how
white people shuffle.

03:51.729 --> 03:54.170
- Mm-hmm, it's true.
[laughter]

03:54.170 --> 03:55.900
- And this is
how black people shuffle.

03:55.900 --> 03:57.870
- Mm-hmm.
[laughter]

03:57.870 --> 04:00.270
- It's 'cause we're all
the same, you bunch of racists.

04:00.270 --> 04:02.030
[laughter]
- Looking for a punch line.

04:02.030 --> 04:03.699
- So full of hate.
- Unbelievable.

04:03.699 --> 04:05.030
- And now...

04:05.030 --> 04:06.569
for a rope trick.

04:06.569 --> 04:09.900
- But first, a card stunt.
Uh, I need a volunteer.

04:09.900 --> 04:11.370
Hi, uh--I'm gonna--
just right over here.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.099
Lady, uh--hey, come over here.
For God sakes.

04:13.099 --> 04:14.569
My God.
Hi, what's you're name?

04:14.569 --> 04:15.900
- Stephanie.
- Stephanie.

04:15.900 --> 04:17.829
Stephanie, can you just
step up here just for a second?

04:17.829 --> 04:19.000
Stephanie, can you just verify

04:19.000 --> 04:20.029
that all these cards are
different.

04:20.029 --> 04:21.199
- Yes.
- Go ahead and take out

04:21.199 --> 04:23.170
any card that you like.
It can be a random card.

04:23.170 --> 04:24.730
It can be a favorite card,
but don't show me.

04:24.730 --> 04:26.170
- And don't show me.
- And don't even show

04:26.170 --> 04:27.329
the camera, okay?
- All right.

04:27.329 --> 04:28.769
- Stephanie, whenever you're
ready put the card back

04:28.769 --> 04:30.230
into the deck.
Perfect.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.699
Stephanie, you can have a seat.
Give Stephanie a hand

04:31.699 --> 04:33.069
for helping out.
Thank you very much, Stephanie.

04:33.069 --> 04:35.600
[cheers and applause]

04:35.600 --> 04:37.699
Stephanie, in a second,
this is what's gonna happen:

04:37.699 --> 04:39.069
I'm gonna squeeze
the deck of cards,

04:39.069 --> 04:40.199
one card's gonna shoot out,

04:40.199 --> 04:42.769
it's gonna rotate 52 times
in the air...

04:42.769 --> 04:44.269
- I'll count.
- Thank you.

04:44.269 --> 04:47.269
- And then I'm gonna
catch your card...

04:47.269 --> 04:50.500
With my lips.
- Whoa!

04:50.500 --> 04:53.500
[laughter]

04:53.500 --> 04:55.170
- How do you feel about that,
Stephanie?

04:55.170 --> 04:56.670
- Good.
both: All right, she's into it.

04:56.670 --> 04:58.329
All right.
- I like it.

04:58.329 --> 05:01.100
- Here we go.
- Drum roll, please.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.829
[audience drum rolls]

05:03.829 --> 05:05.269
- One, two, three.

05:05.269 --> 05:06.500
[sucking in air]
- Whoa!

05:06.500 --> 05:08.069
Stephanie, what was
the name of your card?

05:08.069 --> 05:09.529
- Queen of hearts.
- The queen of hearts.

05:09.529 --> 05:10.870
- The queen of hearts,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:10.870 --> 05:11.870
The queen of hearts.

05:11.870 --> 05:14.000
[cheers and applause]

05:14.000 --> 05:15.899
I did it for you, Stephanie.

05:15.899 --> 05:17.100
[laughter]

05:17.100 --> 05:19.269
I did it for you.

05:19.269 --> 05:20.670
- The queen of hearts?
- Oh, yeah.

05:20.670 --> 05:22.000
- Can I show 'em my thing?
- Of course.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.569
No, no, no, no, no!
- It's different.

05:23.569 --> 05:27.199
It's Vegas.
It's Vegas.

05:27.199 --> 05:29.199
- The queen of hearts!
- Yeah.

05:29.199 --> 05:30.430
[cheers and applause]

05:30.430 --> 05:32.199
Nice.
And finally...

05:32.199 --> 05:34.069
- For the moment
you've all been waiting for.

05:34.069 --> 05:37.000
- To fulfill our contractual
obligation to try to fool you,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Penn and Teller.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.600
Scissors, please.

05:41.029 --> 05:43.199
- The cut and restored
rope trick.

05:46.069 --> 05:47.829
I don't know
if this is gonna work.

05:47.829 --> 05:50.199
- Either way, don't blink.

05:52.029 --> 05:54.170
[cheers and applause]

05:54.170 --> 05:56.199
Thank you very much.

05:57.569 --> 06:00.870
- You guys, you are wonderful
and funny.

06:00.870 --> 06:02.670
And you were both
street performers

06:02.670 --> 06:04.269
that just happened
to meet in line?

06:04.269 --> 06:05.730
Is that correct?
- Uh, yeah, we like to say

06:05.730 --> 06:07.829
we were street workers.
- Oh, street workers, okay.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.100
- Yeah, with hearts of gold.
- A little bit different.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.529
- Oh, I like that.

06:10.529 --> 06:13.170
So this is just a professional
relationship, right?

06:13.170 --> 06:14.930
- Yeah, well, I mean,
we've never hung out

06:14.930 --> 06:17.100
outside of performing.
- Because I look at you guys

06:17.100 --> 06:20.170
and I just picture you guys
as best fr--friends

06:20.170 --> 06:22.269
and you jump rope with this
after the show, and...

06:22.269 --> 06:23.600
[laughter]
But, no.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.230
- We were, like, four years into
the relationship

06:25.230 --> 06:27.100
before we even shook hands.
- Yeah, that's right.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.170
- Oh.
[laughter]

06:28.170 --> 06:31.069
Well, I think we've given them
enough time, sirs.

06:31.069 --> 06:32.730
- Oh, we like duos.

06:32.730 --> 06:34.829
We like duos very, very much.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.829
And the being tied together
with rope,

06:36.829 --> 06:39.100
we know that not only is that
a good act,

06:39.100 --> 06:40.899
and not only is it symbolic,

06:40.899 --> 06:42.769
but it is also
the way you actually feel.

06:42.769 --> 06:44.769
I'm gonna tell you,
being attached to someone else

06:44.769 --> 06:47.199
for your whole career,
it's a living hell.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.370
[laughter]
Um, stage right is David.

06:49.370 --> 06:50.600
Is that right?
- That's right.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.769
- And I consider you
the Penn of the group.

06:52.769 --> 06:54.100
- I suppose, yeah, yeah.
- You do most of the talking.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.170
- Yep.

06:55.170 --> 06:56.000
- And watching you work
is great.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.930
I like the guy
that does most of the talking,

06:57.930 --> 06:59.269
but I think with--
and it's Leeman.

06:59.269 --> 07:00.529
Is that right?
- Yep.

07:00.529 --> 07:01.829
- Uh, with Leeman and Teller,

07:01.829 --> 07:03.769
even though we do
most of the talking,

07:03.769 --> 07:07.430
these guys have so much pull.
Don't you?

07:07.430 --> 07:08.870
- That's true.
- Don't you have a lot of pull?

07:08.870 --> 07:09.870
- A lot of pull.
- I mean, even though

07:09.870 --> 07:11.100
we're doing the talking,

07:11.100 --> 07:13.329
and we kind of propel
the whole thing through,

07:13.329 --> 07:16.000
sometimes it's the other guy
that has a pull.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.029
You know what I'm talking about?

07:17.029 --> 07:18.399
- We know what you're
talking about.

07:18.399 --> 07:19.699
- We know exactly
what you're talking about.

07:19.699 --> 07:21.000
all: Yeah.
- But it's a great trick.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.199
Great trick.
- Well, thank you so much.

07:22.199 --> 07:23.100
- Well, it's, uh--so,

07:23.100 --> 07:24.899
I'm sort of starting
to feel like

07:24.899 --> 07:27.399
I'm back in high school,
and feeling really left out.

07:27.399 --> 07:29.269
[laughter]
Um, so do you know

07:29.269 --> 07:30.500
what they're talking about?
both: Yeah.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.100
- I think that we agree
that I'm better.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.000
I think was the whole consensus.
both: Yes.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.100
- Clearly the cute one.
- That's what I was saying.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.500
- Yes, so you didn't fool them.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.170
- We didn't fool 'em.
- No, we didn't fool 'em.

07:40.170 --> 07:41.370
- Okay, and you're
clear on that,

07:41.370 --> 07:43.170
but you did entertain us,

07:43.170 --> 07:45.500
and we know you need therapy,
so that's great,

07:45.500 --> 07:47.170
but thank you so much.

07:47.170 --> 07:49.730
Guys, give it up
for David and Leeman.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.199
[cheers and applause]

07:51.199 --> 07:53.000
All right, good--oh.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.730
- Just--come on.
- [laughs]

07:56.730 --> 07:59.269
- We still have a few more
tricks up our sleeves

07:59.269 --> 08:01.430
including one
from the four sleeves

08:01.430 --> 08:03.069
of Penn and Teller.

08:03.069 --> 08:05.230
More "Fool Us" on the way
after this.

08:05.230 --> 08:08.230
[jazz music]

08:08.230 --> 08:10.000
â™ª â™ª

08:15.029 --> 08:18.029
[jazz music]

08:18.029 --> 08:20.100
â™ª â™ª

08:20.100 --> 08:23.170
- Welcome back to "Fool Us"
here in Las Vegas

08:23.170 --> 08:25.769
where memories are made
to be forgotten.

08:25.769 --> 08:27.430
[laughter]

08:27.430 --> 08:30.600
Let's meet our next
unforgettable performer.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.000
[firework explodes]

08:33.000 --> 08:34.429
- My name is Jibrizy.

08:34.429 --> 08:36.769
I am the hip-hop illusionist

08:36.769 --> 08:39.100
'cause hip-hop is
about dance and rhythm,

08:39.100 --> 08:41.200
and my magic,
it's about rhythm,

08:41.200 --> 08:42.200
it's about timing.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.899
It's all on the same canvas

08:43.899 --> 08:47.169
'cause it's art,
but it's just different colors.

08:47.169 --> 08:50.100
At the age of 13, I got
diagnosed with Crohn's disease,

08:50.100 --> 08:53.429
so I wasn't able to go outside
for about a good two years.

08:53.429 --> 08:55.330
So I said if I get
one more chance,

08:55.330 --> 08:59.070
I wanna do magic 'cause I wanna
make my impact on this world.

08:59.070 --> 09:01.200
I do magic online.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.100
Social media is so important
to me and my generation.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.529
If you're really trying
to make a impact,

09:06.529 --> 09:08.000
I can't see any other way
if you're not doing it

09:08.000 --> 09:09.000
through social media.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.169
I only live once,

09:10.169 --> 09:13.330
so why just be good?
I want to be legendary.

09:13.330 --> 09:17.029
[cheers and applause]

09:17.029 --> 09:19.769
- Our next performer is
a hip-hop magician,

09:19.769 --> 09:22.070
and I am way too white
to make a joke here,

09:22.070 --> 09:24.330
so please, welcome Jibrizy.

09:24.330 --> 09:27.330
[cheers and applause]

09:29.330 --> 09:31.200
- [sighs]

09:31.200 --> 09:34.070
How you guys doing?
My name is Jibrizy.

09:34.070 --> 09:35.570
I'm 20 years old.

09:35.570 --> 09:39.070
I come from
the south side of Chicago.

09:39.070 --> 09:41.830
[scattered cheers and applause]

09:42.830 --> 09:44.870
Now, when a lot of guys
are my age,

09:44.870 --> 09:47.429
they do some
pretty dangerous things

09:47.429 --> 09:51.000
like gangs...

09:51.000 --> 09:52.899
drugs...

09:52.899 --> 09:54.570
juggling flaming torches.

09:54.570 --> 09:55.870
[scattered laughter]

09:55.870 --> 09:58.169
Studying Latin.
- [laughs]

09:58.169 --> 09:59.669
- Okay, I'm just playing.
I'm just playing, guys.

09:59.669 --> 10:01.000
But people ask me all the time,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.200
"Jibrizy,

10:02.200 --> 10:05.500
how do you make money
doing card tricks?"

10:05.500 --> 10:07.500
It's quite simple.
Let me show you.

10:08.830 --> 10:10.399
Check it out.

10:12.700 --> 10:14.000
audience: Oh.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.230
- Just like so.

10:16.230 --> 10:18.200
And now I got me so moola

10:18.200 --> 10:21.029
to buy me another deck of cards.

10:21.029 --> 10:22.330
Make it rain.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.230
[laughter]

10:24.230 --> 10:27.000
The thing is,
when I was growing up as a kid,

10:27.000 --> 10:28.830
I didn't always have money

10:28.830 --> 10:32.029
to buy those fancy, awesome
props you see at magic shops.

10:32.029 --> 10:34.399
The--you know,
the kits that you see.

10:34.399 --> 10:38.169
I didn't even have money
to afford a magic wand.

10:38.169 --> 10:41.070
The closest things
I had to that were

10:41.070 --> 10:42.669
a pencil

10:42.669 --> 10:46.000
and a pen.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.730
Let's try this.

10:48.730 --> 10:51.870
I'll take the pencil
and I place it into my pocket.

10:51.870 --> 10:55.029
Now, if the pen is here,

10:55.029 --> 10:57.899
then that must mean
that the pencil is here.

10:57.899 --> 10:59.500
Watch this.

11:04.899 --> 11:07.269
[cheers and applause]

11:07.269 --> 11:10.029
All right,
if the pencil is here,

11:10.029 --> 11:13.200
then that must mean
that the pen is...

11:15.669 --> 11:17.570
audience: Ooh!
- Here...

11:17.570 --> 11:20.570
[cheers and applause]

11:21.570 --> 11:25.230
But I came to this realization

11:25.230 --> 11:27.669
that I can do magic
with just about anything.

11:27.669 --> 11:30.529
Even when I couldn't afford
those fancy props.

11:30.529 --> 11:32.870
I can even do magic...

11:32.870 --> 11:34.169
with...

11:34.169 --> 11:35.830
[laughter]

11:35.830 --> 11:38.769
Some sugar, baby.
That's right.

11:38.769 --> 11:41.370
Now, this next trick

11:41.370 --> 11:45.000
I like to call
Sweet Penetration.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.730
[laughter]

11:46.730 --> 11:48.769
Alyson...
- Huh?

11:48.769 --> 11:50.000
- I'm gonna need you
for this one.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.399
- Okay.

11:51.399 --> 11:52.570
[laughter]

11:52.570 --> 11:54.370
Well, then.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.700
I do have to say I'm married.

11:58.700 --> 12:00.230
Sorry.
- It's okay.

12:00.230 --> 12:01.330
- Okay.
- It's only national TV.

12:01.330 --> 12:02.769
- All right.
- All right, so,

12:02.769 --> 12:04.029
we have a bunch
of sugar packets here.

12:04.029 --> 12:05.169
- Okay.
- All right,

12:05.169 --> 12:06.769
I'm gonna mix 'em up.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.769
All right,
what I want you to do

12:08.769 --> 12:10.070
is I want you
to take this Sharpie.

12:10.070 --> 12:12.399
- Yes.
- I want you to put an X

12:12.399 --> 12:16.029
on the coin.
- Ooh, okay.

12:16.029 --> 12:17.929
Ooh, that's tiny.

12:17.929 --> 12:19.169
- Hi.
- It's all good.

12:19.169 --> 12:20.169
Okay.

12:20.169 --> 12:21.429
There.
- Okay.

12:21.429 --> 12:22.929
- Is that good?
- Yep.

12:22.929 --> 12:25.100
- Okay.
- Awesome.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.100
Okay.

12:27.100 --> 12:30.100
Alyson's X.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.600
This is what we'll do.
Alyson...

12:34.600 --> 12:37.169
- Yes.

12:37.169 --> 12:40.169
- What's inside here?
Go ahead, feel it.

12:40.169 --> 12:41.570
- Sugar.
- Sugar.

12:41.570 --> 12:42.700
- Good.
- [chuckles]

12:42.700 --> 12:44.429
- All right,
this is what we're gonna do...

12:44.429 --> 12:47.070
- Yes.
- Check it out.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.370
Alyson...
- Mm-hmm.

12:51.370 --> 12:54.000
- The coin.
- Yes.

13:07.830 --> 13:10.100
- Just like so.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.169
Now, Alyson, do me a favor.
- Mm-hmm.

13:12.169 --> 13:14.029
- Go ahead and feel
the sugar packet.

13:14.029 --> 13:16.669
What do you feel?

13:16.669 --> 13:19.070
- It feels like
the coin's in there.

13:19.070 --> 13:20.029
[cheers and applause]

13:20.029 --> 13:22.200
- Now, look.

13:22.200 --> 13:23.070
Alyson...
- Yeah.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.429
- Do me a favor.
Take the sugar packet...

13:24.429 --> 13:25.500
- Uh-huh.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.000
- I want you to rip it
right in the middle.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.330
- With--okay.
- Yeah, just rip it

13:29.330 --> 13:30.929
straight in the middle.

13:30.929 --> 13:32.529
Beautiful.

13:33.899 --> 13:35.700
And inside...

13:38.000 --> 13:39.769
Is a coin.

13:39.769 --> 13:42.669
[cheers and applause]

13:42.669 --> 13:45.000
Alyson, is that your coin?

13:45.000 --> 13:48.169
- That is my coin.

13:48.169 --> 13:49.169
[cheers and applause]

13:49.169 --> 13:51.870
And you are Jibrizy.

13:51.870 --> 13:54.200
- Thank you so much.
I appreciate your time.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.200
I'm Jibrizy, and peace out.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.070
- Wow, that's fantastic.

13:59.070 --> 14:01.830
Ladies and gentlemen, Jibrizy.
- Oh.

14:01.830 --> 14:03.269
- Here, come over here.

14:03.269 --> 14:05.700
And show them your shoes!

14:05.700 --> 14:08.200
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.000
Very cool.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.269
Well, that was really fantastic.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.529
So you're the magician
for the Chicago Bulls.

14:15.529 --> 14:17.370
- Yes, I am.
- That's incredible.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.330
That's so cool.
- It--the funny thing is

14:19.330 --> 14:21.870
they found me in the newspaper
in the Sports section.

14:21.870 --> 14:22.899
- [chuckles]
What?

14:22.899 --> 14:24.500
- Yep.
- What were you doing there?

14:24.500 --> 14:25.700
- Not sports.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.169
[laughter]
I'll tell you that much.

14:28.169 --> 14:30.169
- Uh, you just turned up?

14:30.169 --> 14:32.330
- Uh, yeah, they just,
like, ended up say--

14:32.330 --> 14:33.600
like, contacting me,
and was like,

14:33.600 --> 14:35.200
"Hey, you want
to do magic for us?"

14:35.200 --> 14:37.100
And I was like, "Yeah, why not?"
Yeah.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.169
- Wow.
It shouldn't be that easy.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.500
Just so you know.
That's--that's very,

14:41.500 --> 14:43.100
very good for you.

14:43.100 --> 14:45.230
- I'll take note.
Next time, make it hard.

14:45.230 --> 14:46.570
[laughter]

14:46.570 --> 14:48.100
- I think Penn and Teller
are ready.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.669
- All right.
- Let's check in with them.

14:49.669 --> 14:53.230
- I love--I love when we have,
you know, younger magicians on

14:53.230 --> 14:54.600
and a whole new way
of thinking about it.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.029
It's just--it just fabulous.

14:56.029 --> 14:58.070
We just like
everything about that,

14:58.070 --> 15:00.399
and, uh, do you know
the name Slydini?

15:00.399 --> 15:02.100
- I do.
- Okay, so you know

15:02.100 --> 15:03.700
what I'm talking about there.
- Yes.

15:03.700 --> 15:05.399
- Uh, I'll also
tell people at home,

15:05.399 --> 15:08.070
and correct me if I'm wrong,
'cause I'm sure you will,

15:08.070 --> 15:12.200
you could have had Alyson write
her initial on there, right?

15:12.200 --> 15:13.399
It didn't have to be an X.

15:13.399 --> 15:15.399
- I--yeah, Alyson--
- It real--it really was

15:15.399 --> 15:18.100
the same coin.
- Uh, I'm--yeah.

15:18.100 --> 15:19.500
- Yeah.
I'm just saying,

15:19.500 --> 15:21.870
it--it might even be
a slightly better trick

15:21.870 --> 15:23.100
than people at home think,

15:23.100 --> 15:26.200
but, uh, I wanna make this
as complimentary as possible

15:26.200 --> 15:28.029
'cause we were really
blown away by it.

15:28.029 --> 15:31.830
What you did was you took
the simple little trick,

15:31.830 --> 15:33.570
and you made it a miracle.

15:33.570 --> 15:35.029
An absolute miracle

15:35.029 --> 15:38.000
because you did slight of hand

15:38.000 --> 15:40.899
with your mouth
with perfect misdirection.

15:40.899 --> 15:42.230
- Oh, thank you.
- And I think you know

15:42.230 --> 15:43.830
what I'm talking about there.
- I do.

15:43.830 --> 15:46.070
- You actually were doing
slight of mouth there.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.029
Um...
[laughter]

15:47.029 --> 15:50.000
And it was really wonderful.
We really loved it,

15:50.000 --> 15:53.200
but, man, we can love you
without you fooling us,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.269
and you didn't really fool us.
Do you feel good about that?

15:55.269 --> 15:57.029
- Uh, could we elaborate
a little bit more

15:57.029 --> 15:58.730
on the Slydini thing?
- Sure, uh...

15:58.730 --> 15:59.929
- A little--a little further.
- Well, we're just saying

15:59.929 --> 16:02.000
that when you--
Slydini had a really cool way

16:02.000 --> 16:03.669
of picking things up off a table

16:03.669 --> 16:05.200
to make 'em disappear
a little bit.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.870
Why doesn't Teller talk to you
a little bit here...

16:06.870 --> 16:08.500
- Okay.
- Because I don't wanna say more

16:08.500 --> 16:10.330
'cause it's too damn good
to give it away.

16:10.330 --> 16:11.830
- Teller's coming up.
[cheers and applause]

16:11.830 --> 16:15.200
- What's up, Teller.
- This is very, very exciting.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.370
- [laughs]
- I--

16:16.370 --> 16:17.830
- It could--could be.
- [indistinct chatter]

16:17.830 --> 16:19.100
- I was--I was very close

16:19.100 --> 16:21.669
and I think
you guys guessed wrong.

16:21.669 --> 16:25.399
- No, I didn't do it like that.
- [squeals]

16:25.399 --> 16:27.029
I see it.
- I think that means, uh...

16:27.029 --> 16:28.600
- I'm gonna say it:
He fooled you!

16:28.600 --> 16:29.830
- You fooled us, my friend.

16:29.830 --> 16:31.830
[cheers and applause]

16:31.830 --> 16:32.830
Beautiful, man.
- Yes!

16:32.830 --> 16:33.870
- Ooh!
- Beautiful!

16:33.870 --> 16:35.070
- Yes...
- Cool, man!

16:35.070 --> 16:37.000
Come on!
- [laughs]

16:37.000 --> 16:38.370
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:38.370 --> 16:41.100
Jibrizy fooled them!

16:41.100 --> 16:42.929
Whoo-hoo!

16:42.929 --> 16:45.269
Congratulations!

16:45.269 --> 16:48.269
[cheers and applause]

16:49.830 --> 16:51.700
Oh, Jibrizy!

16:51.700 --> 16:54.700
- Oh, oh, oh.
- Oh, fantastic.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.169
Congratulations.
- Wonderful.

16:56.169 --> 16:57.600
- Thank you so much.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.070
Jibrizy,
ladies and gen--gentlemen.

17:00.070 --> 17:02.570
[cheers and applause]

17:02.570 --> 17:05.200
Ah...

17:05.200 --> 17:08.098
So Penn and Teller
have been fooled once.

17:08.098 --> 17:10.430
Let's see if another fooler is
in the cards

17:10.430 --> 17:12.769
or--or the magic wands.

17:12.769 --> 17:14.029
See you in a minute.

17:14.029 --> 17:17.029
[jazz music]

17:17.029 --> 17:19.200
â™ª â™ª

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
[jazz music]

17:27.000 --> 17:28.869
â™ª â™ª

17:28.869 --> 17:30.029
- Welcome back.

17:30.029 --> 17:32.200
Penn and Teller have
been fooled once.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
Let's see if they can
redeem themselves

17:34.200 --> 17:36.029
with this next performer.

17:36.029 --> 17:38.000
[firework explodes]

17:39.000 --> 17:41.200
- Hi, I'm Rick Maisel,

17:41.200 --> 17:42.200
escape artist.

17:42.200 --> 17:44.029
Danger is my profession...

17:44.029 --> 17:47.329
[dramatic music]

17:47.329 --> 17:50.500
And I've had
near-death experiences.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.829
I was submerged in a milk can,

17:52.829 --> 17:55.269
and it's impossible to breathe.

17:55.269 --> 17:58.369
Two minutes
and 45 seconds goes by,

17:58.369 --> 18:01.829
and I'm using both hands
and my head

18:01.829 --> 18:03.400
as a battering ram to escape.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.930
â™ª â™ª

18:04.930 --> 18:06.170
Whew.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.329
The escape
that I'm gonna perform

18:07.329 --> 18:08.599
on tonight's show,

18:08.599 --> 18:10.069
it's super dangerous

18:10.069 --> 18:12.930
and the key is not to panic.

18:12.930 --> 18:15.430
Like Houdini,
my margin of error

18:15.430 --> 18:17.529
is life or death.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.730
[cheers and applause]

18:19.730 --> 18:22.430
- Please welcome Rick Maisel.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.369
- Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.000
This evening,
I'm going to attempt an escape.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.430
An original escape,
and actually,

18:29.430 --> 18:32.170
I'm going to attempt to escape
from handcuffs and leg irons

18:32.170 --> 18:35.000
while I'm inside
this spinning washing machine,

18:35.000 --> 18:38.029
but we're going to add
soap and water.

18:38.029 --> 18:40.930
Um, I'm actually going
to need the assistance tonight

18:40.930 --> 18:43.930
from Ryan Stock and AmberLynn.

18:43.930 --> 18:46.670
They're actually my assistants
and safety experts.

18:46.670 --> 18:48.069
[cheers and applause]

18:48.069 --> 18:49.170
- Great.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.099
I'm here to be
the voice of Rick.

18:51.099 --> 18:52.430
He's gonna be inside
a washing machine.

18:52.430 --> 18:54.099
He's not gonna be able
to hear you guys.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.930
You're not gonna be able
to hear him.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.829
AmberLynn is here
to chain him up.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.900
A dream for some people
out there.

19:00.900 --> 19:05.329
Now, she is locking him up
in regulation police handcuffs.

19:05.329 --> 19:08.200
She also has a set of shackles
that's going on.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.170
Each one of the locks
that go on there are real.

19:11.170 --> 19:13.029
Now, that's two pairs of cuffs.

19:13.029 --> 19:15.099
We're gonna go
all the way up his arms.

19:15.099 --> 19:16.869
This is pair number three.

19:16.869 --> 19:19.400
We're gonna go cuff number four.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.599
And the final one,
cuff number five goes on.

19:22.599 --> 19:26.099
Now, once we put him
into the washing machine,

19:26.099 --> 19:27.730
I'm gonna do a countdown
with you guys.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.170
It's gonna go: Three, two, one.

19:30.170 --> 19:32.500
Amber is gonna
turn on the machine.

19:32.500 --> 19:33.900
She's gonna turn on the machine

19:33.900 --> 19:36.000
so that I don't get
the blame for it.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.269
You got this, Rick?

19:37.269 --> 19:38.700
- Almost.
- Almost.

19:38.700 --> 19:40.200
We're gonna put
the leg shackles on.

19:40.200 --> 19:42.369
Now, we're not gonna
set this on delicate.

19:42.369 --> 19:44.170
We're gonna set it on normal,

19:44.170 --> 19:46.029
but there's nothing normal
about washing your clothes

19:46.029 --> 19:47.369
while you're wearing them.

19:47.369 --> 19:49.269
Some of the water's actually
already in the washing machine,

19:49.269 --> 19:51.400
and that way we don't have
to wait for it to fill up,

19:51.400 --> 19:54.029
and then Amber is going
to pour in the rest.

19:54.029 --> 19:58.200
- And just pull on them
for the audience.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.099
- You ready, Rick?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.400
- Yes, I'm just gonna
slow my heart rate down.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.599
- All right.

20:03.599 --> 20:07.430
â™ª â™ª

20:07.430 --> 20:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
once he gets in there

20:10.000 --> 20:14.200
he's got two minutes to escape.

20:14.200 --> 20:16.069
This is a trick in itself.

20:16.069 --> 20:18.769
Fitting himself
into this washing machine.

20:18.769 --> 20:21.200
You can see it's a tight fit.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.670
He barely has room to move.

20:22.670 --> 20:25.769
Never mind try to pick
five sets of cuffs

20:25.769 --> 20:27.500
and a set of leg irons.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.069
All right, we're gonna
close the door.

20:29.069 --> 20:31.230
We're gonna lock it up.
We're turning this machine

20:31.230 --> 20:32.269
into a death trap.

20:32.269 --> 20:35.069
[grunts]
You got it?

20:35.069 --> 20:36.230
You ready?

20:36.230 --> 20:37.400
- Almost.

20:37.400 --> 20:38.400
â™ª â™ª

20:38.400 --> 20:39.900
- Here we go.

20:39.900 --> 20:42.269
Amber is gonna close the door.

20:42.269 --> 20:44.170
- Yep, still in the restraints.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.269
All right, let's go.

20:45.269 --> 20:47.099
- Here we go.
Close it out.

20:47.099 --> 20:48.670
[cheers and applause]

20:48.670 --> 20:51.230
- Everybody, count it down.
In three...

20:51.230 --> 20:54.029
all: Two...
One!

20:54.029 --> 20:56.769
All right, now I know as
you guys are looking in there,

20:56.769 --> 20:58.029
you can see there is some water.

20:58.029 --> 21:00.329
Now Amber is adding actual
soap and water

21:00.329 --> 21:02.599
to the washing machine.
She is filling this up.

21:02.599 --> 21:04.029
Now, I know you're thinking
at this point,

21:04.029 --> 21:06.230
"How does he breath
while he's in there?"

21:06.230 --> 21:08.069
The answer's simple, he doesn't.

21:08.069 --> 21:09.099
He doesn't breath
while he's in there.

21:09.099 --> 21:10.829
I want you guys
to hold your breath

21:10.829 --> 21:12.769
along with Rick
while he's in there.

21:12.769 --> 21:14.369
Now imagine the force,

21:14.369 --> 21:17.400
the g-forces pushing the blood
up into his brain.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.200
And here's the weird part,
while he's escaping,

21:20.200 --> 21:22.769
each time he removes
a set of handcuffs,

21:22.769 --> 21:24.000
it becomes more dangerous.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.329
That set of cuffs becomes
a projectile

21:26.329 --> 21:27.769
that may hit him in the face.

21:27.769 --> 21:29.029
That could even knock him out

21:29.029 --> 21:31.170
while he's inside
the washing machine.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.529
Now, he has to escape
in a minute.

21:33.529 --> 21:36.869
We're talking--around a minute
is what we're looking for here.

21:36.869 --> 21:39.599
Now, uh, we actually had
an incident in rehearsal.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.829
Somebody left a red sock
in the washing machine

21:41.829 --> 21:43.369
and he came out pink.

21:43.369 --> 21:45.099
A serious incident.

21:45.099 --> 21:48.099
Now we--we are at 53 seconds.
53 seconds.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.170
Now, we're hoping he gets out
in one minute.

21:50.170 --> 21:52.099
If he doesn't get out
within two minutes

21:52.099 --> 21:54.069
it goes into the spin cycle.

21:54.069 --> 21:55.230
The deadly spin cycle.

21:55.230 --> 21:58.829
You know how bad it is
to get caught in the spin cycle.

21:58.829 --> 22:00.700
No you don't.
Only Rick knows how bad it is

22:00.700 --> 22:02.069
to get caught
in the spin cycle.

22:02.069 --> 22:04.400
We are at a minute
and ten seconds.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.170
A minute and ten seconds.

22:06.170 --> 22:07.730
If he's in there
for another 30 seconds,

22:07.730 --> 22:09.430
I'm gonna have
to throw in the towel.

22:09.430 --> 22:10.670
[laughter]
Is he gonna make it?

22:10.670 --> 22:13.200
Will he get out of here?
Ladies and gentlemen--

22:13.200 --> 22:15.029
yes, check if he's okay.
Here's the problem,

22:15.029 --> 22:16.599
if he doesn't get his hands
out of the cuffs,

22:16.599 --> 22:18.000
he can't signal us,

22:18.000 --> 22:21.029
and if he does have a safe word,
we can't hear it.

22:21.029 --> 22:23.099
I was, uh--we're at a, uh--
we're at a minute 30.

22:23.099 --> 22:24.269
A minute 30.
[knocks on glass]

22:24.269 --> 22:25.930
A minute thir--
ladies and gentlemen, he's out.

22:25.930 --> 22:29.730
Give it up for Rick Maisel!

22:29.730 --> 22:32.730
[cheers and applause]

22:37.500 --> 22:40.269
- Whoa!

22:40.269 --> 22:41.930
Wow.

22:41.930 --> 22:45.329
Whoo!
That is absolutely incredible.

22:45.329 --> 22:47.170
- Thank you.
- Oh, man.

22:47.170 --> 22:50.099
So you've actually,
um, like broken world records.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.400
- Yes, and again,
this is not a world record

22:52.400 --> 22:54.599
that I want anyone to--

22:54.599 --> 22:56.869
actually, to ever try
and attempt.

22:56.869 --> 22:59.000
Um, and I'm the current
world record holder

22:59.000 --> 23:03.000
for the straightjacket escape
in 2.23 seconds.

23:03.000 --> 23:04.000
- Wow.
That's incredible.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.369
[cheers and applause]

23:06.369 --> 23:08.430
- Thank you.
- Wow.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.400
Well, let's go
to Penn and Teller

23:10.400 --> 23:12.700
and see what they think
of your magic.

23:12.700 --> 23:16.170
- A washing machine is precisely

23:16.170 --> 23:19.500
what Houdini would escape from
in the 21st century.

23:19.500 --> 23:21.170
This is really,

23:21.170 --> 23:23.529
uh, in the direct lineage
of Houdini.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.099
Whereas all the people
who recreate his escapes

23:26.099 --> 23:27.329
aren't doing Houdini at all.

23:27.329 --> 23:30.369
Houdini did not recreate things.
He created things.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.000
I've never seen anything
like this.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.900
I will also say,
Teller and I have been

23:33.900 --> 23:37.230
in a room with a million bees.

23:37.230 --> 23:39.500
Teller's been
in every kind of water tank.

23:39.500 --> 23:42.170
Uh, Teller has been,
uh, in a, uh, cement mixer.

23:42.170 --> 23:43.529
- Trust me,
I'm very impressed with you all.

23:43.529 --> 23:44.930
- We've done every sort of
thing,

23:44.930 --> 23:46.829
and Teller just said to me
while he was watching you

23:46.829 --> 23:49.230
that he would not do this.

23:49.230 --> 23:53.200
Um, and what I should also tell
people here is that

23:53.200 --> 23:56.599
the vast--the vast majority
of this is all real.

23:56.599 --> 23:59.730
You are just one crazy
son of a bitch.

23:59.730 --> 24:03.369
- [laughs]
[cheers and applause]

24:03.369 --> 24:04.599
- Um...
- I take that as a compliment.

24:04.599 --> 24:05.869
Thank you.

24:05.869 --> 24:07.099
- And, you know,
Houdini would do,

24:07.099 --> 24:08.930
uh, handcuff things as well.

24:08.930 --> 24:12.569
He would do jumps with cuffs
off, uh--off bridges,

24:12.569 --> 24:14.599
in boxes,
all that kind of stuff,

24:14.599 --> 24:18.069
and I think you are in direct--
direct descendant of Houdini's.

24:18.069 --> 24:19.599
You're really great...
- Wow, what a compliment.

24:19.599 --> 24:23.170
- But I hope somewhere in there
I snuck in a word or two

24:23.170 --> 24:24.269
that gave you
a little bit of a wink.

24:24.269 --> 24:25.769
What do you think there?
- Awesome.

24:25.769 --> 24:27.369
- [laughs]
- I'm so--I'm s--I'm, like--

24:27.369 --> 24:29.430
you guys are--
I'm such a fan of you all.

24:29.430 --> 24:31.029
- Aww.
- So this is really cool

24:31.029 --> 24:33.000
to hear this from you.
- Yo--just great, man.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.269
- Thank you.
- That is high,

24:34.269 --> 24:36.700
high praise indeed.
- Just great.

24:36.700 --> 24:40.670
So, obviously, not a fooler,
but certainly very impressed...

24:40.670 --> 24:42.829
- Fabulous.
- And I've never heard them

24:42.829 --> 24:44.170
gush more.
- Awesome, awesome.

24:44.170 --> 24:47.529
So thank you, Rick Maisel!

24:47.529 --> 24:49.069
- Oh, man.
- Thank you, all right.

24:49.069 --> 24:50.430
- Thank you.

24:50.430 --> 24:53.000
[cheers and applause]
- Thank you!

24:53.000 --> 24:54.569
Whoo!

24:56.769 --> 24:58.430
[sighs]
Mentalists,

24:58.430 --> 25:01.000
slight of hand artists,
flesh eating zombies,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.269
we'll try anything
to fool Penn and Teller.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.730
Stick around
and see what's next.

25:05.730 --> 25:08.730

[jazz music]

25:18.869 --> 25:21.869
[cheers and applause]

25:23.029 --> 25:24.730
- Welcome back to "Fool Us"

25:24.730 --> 25:27.500
where magicians expose
themselves to Penn and Teller

25:27.500 --> 25:29.700
and no one has
to call the police.

25:29.700 --> 25:32.670
Let's take a peek
at our next potential fooler.

25:32.670 --> 25:34.930
[firework explodes]

25:34.930 --> 25:36.329
- Hi, I'm Felix Bodden.

25:36.329 --> 25:38.029
[speaking Spanish]

25:38.029 --> 25:39.200
[upbeat music]

25:39.200 --> 25:40.930
I'm from
the Dominican Republic,

25:40.930 --> 25:43.099
and I'm a card magician.

25:43.099 --> 25:47.000
Being a magician in
the Dominican Republic is rare

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
just simply because
there are no magicians at all.

25:50.000 --> 25:52.200
In 2001, the first movie

25:52.200 --> 25:54.700
of the "Harry Potter" saga
came out,

25:54.700 --> 25:56.230
and, man, when I saw that

25:56.230 --> 25:59.269
I became obsessed with magic.

25:59.269 --> 26:02.769
I got so excited that
I wanted to share my magic

26:02.769 --> 26:05.569
in other ways
than just doing shows,

26:05.569 --> 26:08.000
so I started doing videos.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.730
I became famous.

26:11.730 --> 26:14.200
If I succeed
in "Penn & Teller: Fool Us"

26:14.200 --> 26:16.430
magic will be seen
with other eyes

26:16.430 --> 26:18.869
in the Dominican Republic.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.869
It needs to start
from somewhere, right?

26:21.869 --> 26:24.670
[cheers and applause]

26:24.670 --> 26:27.069
- Please welcome Felix Bodden.

26:27.069 --> 26:29.369
- [chuckles]
Hello.

26:29.369 --> 26:30.670
Hello, hello.
Buenos noche...

26:30.670 --> 26:33.000
[speaking Spanish]
Uh, my name is Felix Bodden.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.900
I'm a magician from the D.R.,
Dominican Republic,

26:35.900 --> 26:38.670
and it is a dream come true
to be here today.

26:38.670 --> 26:42.029
I mean, talking about dreams,
have you ever wondered

26:42.029 --> 26:44.430
how awesome life would be
if we had real powers?

26:44.430 --> 26:46.670
I mean, I could take something
as simple as

26:46.670 --> 26:49.200
taking the cards out of the box
and making it look magical.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.829
Well, something like this.

26:51.829 --> 26:54.400
[exhales]

26:54.400 --> 26:56.000
And the card box vanishes...

26:56.000 --> 26:58.430
[cheers and applause]

26:58.430 --> 27:00.900
And reappears

27:00.900 --> 27:03.099
inside my pocket.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.269
I mean, that would be amazing.

27:04.269 --> 27:06.099
I wish I could do that for real.

27:06.099 --> 27:09.029
Um, or maybe,
while doing a card trick,

27:09.029 --> 27:11.200
you know,
there's always a card selected.

27:11.200 --> 27:13.369
In this case, the kind of clubs.

27:13.369 --> 27:16.000
The king is placed
right in the middle

27:16.000 --> 27:17.269
of the pack,

27:17.269 --> 27:19.069
and now,
since I have real powers,

27:19.069 --> 27:20.900
I can do whatever I want, right?

27:20.900 --> 27:23.769
For instance,
if I just snap my fingers

27:23.769 --> 27:25.769
it will appear right on top...
audience: Wow.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.000
- But, of course,
that's impossible.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.700
That's impossible.
I mean, for real.

27:29.700 --> 27:31.769
That's impossible.
The card is in the middle.

27:31.769 --> 27:33.529
Remember?

27:33.529 --> 27:36.500
But, of course, that's just
my imagination telling me things

27:36.500 --> 27:38.269
that I know are
never going to happen.

27:38.269 --> 27:40.099
I really came here tonight
to show you

27:40.099 --> 27:42.000
one of my favorite card tricks.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.569
So, Alyson, would you mind
joining me here?

27:43.569 --> 27:45.200
A big round of applause
for Alyson.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.029
- Aww.
[cheers and applause]

27:47.029 --> 27:48.269
- I'm honored.
How you doing?

27:48.269 --> 27:49.269
Good?
- Great.

27:49.269 --> 27:50.269
- Okay.
- Yes.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.529
- Oh, man.
- Ooh.

27:51.529 --> 27:53.230
- Right now I'm gonna
pass the cards like this,

27:53.230 --> 27:55.400
and whenever you want
say "stop."

27:55.400 --> 27:56.400
- Uh...
- Say "stop."

27:56.400 --> 27:57.670
- Stop.
- Okay, that will be your card.

27:57.670 --> 27:58.670
- Okay.
- Take a look at it.

27:58.670 --> 28:00.930
Remember it.
Show it to everyone here.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.369
I won't see.
- Yes.

28:02.369 --> 28:04.670
- And I also want you
to sign it on the face.

28:04.670 --> 28:06.670
- Okay.
- Please put your,

28:06.670 --> 28:09.269
uh, smiley face,
a phone number...

28:09.269 --> 28:11.329
[laughter]
Or maybe your bank account

28:11.329 --> 28:13.569
with the password.
Something simple.

28:13.569 --> 28:15.170
Okay?
- Okay.

28:15.170 --> 28:17.099
- Let me know when you got it.
- I got it.

28:17.099 --> 28:19.170
- Okay, perfect.
Show it one last time.

28:19.170 --> 28:21.069
Let me know.
- Okay.

28:21.069 --> 28:22.170
- Are you done?
- Yes.

28:22.170 --> 28:24.569
- Okay, place the card
back inside in the deck.

28:24.569 --> 28:25.569
- In--in the deck.
- Yeah.

28:25.569 --> 28:27.029
- Okay.
- I'm gonna turn over.

28:27.029 --> 28:28.569
I want you to shuffle the deck.

28:28.569 --> 28:30.230
- Oh, boy.
- Yeah, I know.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.099
- I've had nightmares
about this.

28:32.099 --> 28:33.599
[groans]
- This is a relief for me.

28:33.599 --> 28:35.329
- This--this is
very embarrassing.

28:35.329 --> 28:37.829
- Oh, that was good.
- [grunts]

28:37.829 --> 28:39.230
[cheers and applause]

28:39.230 --> 28:40.599
- That was perfect.
- Okay.

28:40.599 --> 28:43.200
- Thank you.
So now, Alyson...

28:43.200 --> 28:44.230
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna find your card.

28:44.230 --> 28:47.170
- Okay.
- Um, the problem is

28:47.170 --> 28:48.769
I don't know how to do it.
- Oh.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.069
- Uh, yeah.

28:50.069 --> 28:53.730
Uh, that's why I need the help
from two famous magicians,

28:53.730 --> 28:55.329
which are right here tonight.

28:55.329 --> 28:56.829
-[laughs]
So, everybody, please welcome

28:56.829 --> 28:59.069
Mr. Jose and Ramon,
which are right here

28:59.069 --> 29:00.670
inside the box.
[laughter]

29:00.670 --> 29:02.569
Boom.

29:02.569 --> 29:05.069
They are very famous magicians.
- Oh.

29:05.069 --> 29:06.400
- Do you know them?
- No.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.930
- They are in every single
deck of cards you buy.

29:08.930 --> 29:09.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:09.930 --> 29:11.500
I want you to check them out.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.730
They're normal, right?
- Yes, very.

29:12.730 --> 29:15.930
- Okay, so now,
they're gonna find your card.

29:15.930 --> 29:18.200
Pass me Jose.
- Uh, that one.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.269
- No, that's Ramon.
- Oh, sorry.

29:19.269 --> 29:21.400
- Okay.
[laughter]

29:21.400 --> 29:23.099
- Oh, wait.
- Mm.

29:23.099 --> 29:24.829
- There's a problem.
- Oh, dear.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.769
- Um, this is an issue.

29:26.769 --> 29:30.329
Uh, they don't know
what the card is.

29:30.329 --> 29:32.069
- Oh.
- So I just need you

29:32.069 --> 29:33.230
to whisper your card to them.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.730
Not to me.
Not to anyone here.

29:34.730 --> 29:36.329
I'm gonna turn around.
- Okay.

29:36.329 --> 29:38.069
- So do it now.
Let me know.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.869
- To both of 'em?
- Yeah, to--to both of them.

29:40.869 --> 29:42.029
[laughter]
- Nice, okay.

29:42.029 --> 29:43.029
- You got it?
- Yeah.

29:43.029 --> 29:44.329
- Okay, perfect.

29:44.329 --> 29:46.900
So now that they know your card

29:46.900 --> 29:48.529
they're gonna find it.
- Okay.

29:48.529 --> 29:50.329
- Jose will go right on top.

29:50.329 --> 29:51.569
You can see
they have different backs

29:51.569 --> 29:53.069
so you can follow them.
- Yes.

29:53.069 --> 29:54.569
- And Ramon will be
on the bottom.

29:54.569 --> 29:56.000
You can see all the cards
they have in the middle,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.099
so, hopefully, one of those
should be yours.

29:58.099 --> 29:59.529
- Okay.
- So you're gonna help me now.

29:59.529 --> 30:00.769
Okay?
- Okay.

30:00.769 --> 30:02.099
- I'm gonna put the deck
right in the middle.

30:02.099 --> 30:03.200
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on over.

30:03.200 --> 30:06.029
- Oh.
- Put your hand right on top.

30:06.029 --> 30:07.769
- Just like this.
- Like, to--oh, yes.

30:07.769 --> 30:10.170
- And whenever you want,
I want you to snap your fingers,

30:10.170 --> 30:11.769
but before you do...
- Mm-hmm?

30:11.769 --> 30:14.269
- You need to believe

30:14.269 --> 30:16.200
because if you don't,
they won't do anything.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.329
- Okay, I believe.

30:17.329 --> 30:19.170
- Okay, so,
whenever you're ready, snap.

30:20.269 --> 30:22.269
That's perfect.
Right now they are moving.

30:22.269 --> 30:24.269
You remember Jose was here,
Ramon was there?

30:24.269 --> 30:26.069
- Yes.
- They started getting closer,

30:26.069 --> 30:27.930
closer, and closer...
- Uh-huh.

30:27.930 --> 30:29.930
- And suddenly, they stop.
- Okay.

30:29.930 --> 30:30.930
- But you don't believe me,
right?

30:30.930 --> 30:31.930
- I do believe you.
I believe.

30:31.930 --> 30:33.069
- Oh, thank you.
- I believe.

30:33.069 --> 30:34.200
[laughter]
Thank you.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.369
- Yeah.

30:35.369 --> 30:37.170
- So, if that's true,

30:37.170 --> 30:39.029
they move all the way
from here to there.

30:39.029 --> 30:41.029
Leaving only a few cards
in the middle.

30:41.029 --> 30:42.529
- Yeah.
- Hopefully, one of those

30:42.529 --> 30:44.500
should be yours, right?
- I hope so.

30:44.500 --> 30:46.769
- So--I hope so too.
[laughter]

30:46.769 --> 30:48.000
Without being very precise,

30:48.000 --> 30:50.000
how many cards do you believe
they have in the middle now?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.369
Five, four, six?
- I--

30:51.369 --> 30:52.829
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

30:52.829 --> 30:55.670
- It doesn't matter.
Just put your hand right on top,

30:55.670 --> 30:58.500
and whenever you want,
snap your fingers.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.130
Oh, man, I saw that.
- Better snap.

31:00.130 --> 31:01.230
- You saw.
They start moving again.

31:01.230 --> 31:03.730
- Oh.
- Getting closer and closer.

31:03.730 --> 31:05.670
This time, almost touching.

31:05.670 --> 31:07.869
I said almost because now...

31:10.170 --> 31:12.000
They only have one card,
and one card only.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000
- [gasps]

31:15.029 --> 31:17.230
- For the first time, Alyson,
what was your card?

31:17.230 --> 31:19.829
- Three of hearts.
- The three of hearts.

31:19.829 --> 31:22.329
Oh, man.

31:22.329 --> 31:24.000
And that's exactly
the three of hearts

31:24.000 --> 31:25.829
signed by Alyson.

31:25.829 --> 31:27.000
[cheers and applause]

31:27.000 --> 31:28.200
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Alyson.

31:28.200 --> 31:31.029
- That was amazing.

31:31.029 --> 31:33.170
Ladies and gentlemen,
Felix Bodden.

31:33.170 --> 31:36.700
- Oh, come on.
- That is so cool.

31:36.700 --> 31:39.430
All right, well,
they're obviously gonna talk

31:39.430 --> 31:41.069
amongst themselves...
- Yeah.

31:41.069 --> 31:43.529
- But I want to talk to you.
That was so cool.

31:43.529 --> 31:45.230
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- I love that.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.829
And so, what was
your first trick?

31:46.829 --> 31:48.000
- Um, my first trick?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.930
Uh, it was a variation
of this one, actually.

31:49.930 --> 31:51.170
- Oh, oh, really?
- Yes.

31:51.170 --> 31:54.000
Yeah, I love it.
- And, um--and do your friends

31:54.000 --> 31:56.029
just make you do it
all the time and...

31:56.029 --> 31:58.029
- Oh, no, in the beginning
it was like that,

31:58.029 --> 31:59.829
but now they need to pay
and they don't want to.

31:59.829 --> 32:01.200
[laughter]

32:01.200 --> 32:03.000
- Nice.
- So, basically, yeah.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.930
- That's funny.
You're so charming,

32:04.930 --> 32:06.700
and so wonderful,
and that was really cool.

32:06.700 --> 32:07.930
- Oh, come on.
I'm gonna blush.

32:07.930 --> 32:08.930
- Aww.
[laughter]

32:08.930 --> 32:11.829
All right, well,
our Jose and Ramon

32:11.829 --> 32:14.200
are looking like
they're a little...

32:14.200 --> 32:15.400
- Mm.
- I don't know, they--they're--

32:15.400 --> 32:17.769
they--they're discussing
quite seriously.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.769
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, hi.

32:18.769 --> 32:20.000
all: Hi.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
- Welcome to our show.
- Thank you, thank you.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.670
- We have so many
North American magicians.

32:24.670 --> 32:26.170
- Thank you.
[cheers and applause]

32:26.170 --> 32:27.569
- Good to have someone Latin
on the show.

32:27.569 --> 32:29.000
- Oh, yes.
- That's wonderful.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.500
Although, now it scares me.

32:30.500 --> 32:33.029
Now we've opened up
a bigger geographical area.

32:33.029 --> 32:34.670
We're gonna get
a lot of great people like you.

32:34.670 --> 32:35.829
That was a great act.
Great act.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.869
- Oh, thank you.
- Um, you know, it was nice

32:37.869 --> 32:41.430
that while I liked that
part of your dirty work walls--

32:41.430 --> 32:43.670
was done while talking
about the dirty work.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.369
I always like that.
Always like,

32:45.369 --> 32:48.029
"Let's look at how this looks,"
and then doing the thing.

32:48.029 --> 32:50.329
I'll also say that
a lot of times,

32:50.329 --> 32:52.829
you think misdirection's just
pointing over there,

32:52.829 --> 32:54.099
but it's always done
in the plot.

32:54.099 --> 32:57.029
It was nice that you were able
to gi--put all the attention

32:57.029 --> 32:59.069
on Alyson whispering
to the cards

32:59.069 --> 33:01.000
and doing all that
while you were able

33:01.000 --> 33:03.829
to do some, um, some other
little business in there.

33:03.829 --> 33:06.230
Now, you know, we are a,
uh--we're a team,

33:06.230 --> 33:09.099
uh, Penn and Teller,
and, uh, I don't know,

33:09.099 --> 33:10.700
you probably don't know,

33:10.700 --> 33:13.930
um, U.S.A. magicians

33:13.930 --> 33:16.200
from the '40s or '50s...
- Oh.

33:16.200 --> 33:18.200
- But we've kind of
patterned ourselves

33:18.200 --> 33:20.869
on, uh--on an act that was
called "Shift and Cull,"

33:20.869 --> 33:22.230
but Shift and Cull
were two people that

33:22.230 --> 33:25.000
we really, really loved
as a, uh, magic team,

33:25.000 --> 33:27.069
but it's a wonderful act.
We really love it.

33:27.069 --> 33:28.599
And moving things
close together,

33:28.599 --> 33:31.369
and sandwiching in between,
always a good idea.

33:31.369 --> 33:32.430
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thanks.

33:32.430 --> 33:34.029
- Does that
mean anything to you?

33:34.029 --> 33:35.670
- Oh, yeah, of course it does.
- Okay.

33:35.670 --> 33:37.430
The double--the double act?
[all laugh]

33:37.430 --> 33:39.869
- Okay, and so
somebody on Twitter

33:39.869 --> 33:43.029
will explain it to me, I hope.
[both laugh]

33:43.029 --> 33:44.769
And, so--so you're satisfied
that they know

33:44.769 --> 33:46.400
how you did your trick...
- Yeah, I believe so.

33:46.400 --> 33:49.170
- And that you didn't fool them?
But you certainly entertained,

33:49.170 --> 33:53.029
uh, us, and--and now you've
made fans out of this country.

33:53.029 --> 33:55.730
Now you're
an international magician,

33:55.730 --> 33:58.269
and thank you so much.

33:58.269 --> 34:02.170
Felix Bodden, everyone.
Thank you.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.000
[cheers and applause]

34:04.000 --> 34:06.599
Not enough magic for you?
Well, don't go away.

34:06.599 --> 34:08.170
We have a trick
from our very own

34:08.170 --> 34:10.170
Penn and Teller coming up.

34:23.900 --> 34:25.369
[playing lilting piano music]

34:25.369 --> 34:29.530
- Penn and Teller lovingly refer
to themselves as carny trash

34:29.530 --> 34:31.268
'cause they started out
performing

34:31.268 --> 34:34.730
at Renaissance festivals
and state fairs.

34:34.730 --> 34:38.199
Watch Penn, accompanied
by Georgie Bernasek,

34:38.199 --> 34:39.829
take us back to their roots

34:39.829 --> 34:43.829
with a red-hot display
of carny magic.

34:43.829 --> 34:45.230

Wow.
- That's, uh, Mike Jones

39:59.599 --> 40:01.230
over there.
Mike Jones.

40:01.230 --> 40:03.070
- Whoo!
- Georgie Bernasek.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.329
- Georgie.
- And the most dangerous part

40:05.329 --> 40:07.199
of that whole trick is
smoking the cigarettes.

40:07.199 --> 40:09.329
- [laughs]
- Don't smoke cigarettes, ugh.

40:09.329 --> 40:10.429
- No.

40:10.429 --> 40:11.869
For Penn, Teller,

40:11.869 --> 40:13.400
and all of us here at "Fool Us,"

40:13.400 --> 40:15.599
we thank you so much
for watching,

40:15.599 --> 40:17.570
and hope you had
a magical night.

40:17.570 --> 40:19.570
See you next week!
