09:09.917 --> 09:12.959
-Who?
-Who's Alex Chilton?

09:12.959 --> 09:14.250
Hmm.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.750
[chuckles]
Get this kid away from me.

09:17.750 --> 09:20.583
Well, Chilton was the lead
singer of The Box Tops.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.708
-Founder of Big Star.
-I don't listen to pop music.

09:22.708 --> 09:26.000
He went to school like seven
blocks from here on Poplar.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.208
Not bad.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.084
The Replacements
wrote a song about him.

09:29.084 --> 09:30.792
Well, now you're just
showing off.

09:31.959 --> 09:34.083
-You play?
-A little.

09:34.083 --> 09:36.583
Well, quit that,
learn a trade.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.667
You don't wanna be
where I am, not ever.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.458
I know how frustrated
you feel.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.625
But Julian is smart
and he's gonna help you.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.875
We're hoping to get
your sentence reduced.

09:46.875 --> 09:49.084
Oh, well, lucky me.

09:49.084 --> 09:52.000
I shouldn't have been
convicted in the first place.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.041
I got screwed by the system.

09:54.041 --> 09:55.542
Public defender didn't care.

09:55.542 --> 09:57.542
Julian doesn't care.

09:57.542 --> 09:59.542
Nobody does, really.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.375
And that's what
I call frustrating.

10:01.375 --> 10:05.291
And you, blondie,
have no idea what I feel.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.583
I'm sorry.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.084
And I'm innocent.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.625
Neither thing makes
a difference in my life.

10:18.042 --> 10:19.500
We're done.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.083
[instrumental music]

10:36.166 --> 10:38.125
[all]
LU!

10:40.208 --> 10:43.125
We can tell you!

10:43.125 --> 10:44.834
Way to keep above it!

10:44.834 --> 10:47.375
Keep your hands up!

10:47.375 --> 10:51.583
Let's get it started!
LU, just stand up!

10:51.583 --> 10:54.042
Show 'em where your heart is!

10:54.042 --> 10:55.959
LU!

10:56.792 --> 10:58.208
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:59.042 --> 11:00.208
Wait.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.125
Why are you moving the camera?

11:02.125 --> 11:05.000
If we mix it up a little,
our video might
stand out more.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.417
Or it might suck.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.583
It's just a little swish pan.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.167
And it'll make it interesting.

11:11.167 --> 11:12.083
Right?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.208
Don't speak. Don't speak.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.708
That's the theory. Yeah.

11:18.708 --> 11:23.000
[chuckles] Uh, we're taking
marching orders from
your boyfriend?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.708
-He's a filmmaker.
-Oh.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.209
How many bid videos
have you made?

11:29.209 --> 11:31.083
-Not a one.
-I've made four.

11:31.083 --> 11:33.708
So I think I know a bit more
about them than you.

11:33.708 --> 11:35.834
But thanks for stopping by.

11:35.834 --> 11:37.000
Door's that way.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.834
[whistles]
That's pretty myopic.

11:39.834 --> 11:43.708
[chuckles] Myopic?
Who talks like that?

11:43.708 --> 11:44.959
Look, from what I hear

11:44.959 --> 11:46.375
you guys are being
forced to compete

11:46.375 --> 11:48.458
against the best teams
across the nation.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.417
Alice can't fly, and
Marti's still a little green.

11:51.417 --> 11:54.042
The Hellcats aren't showing
at their full potential.

11:54.042 --> 11:56.458
On an even playing field...

11:56.458 --> 11:58.208
you lose.

11:58.208 --> 12:02.083
Okay, all Savannah's
suggesting is to change
up the paradigm

12:02.083 --> 12:04.208
in order to give y'all
a better shot at winning.

12:04.208 --> 12:06.041
The deadline is 48 hours away.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.875
This is no time to be
reinventing the wheel.

12:08.875 --> 12:11.125
He's only talking about
changing up the presentation.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.042
You guys ever think
about filming outside?

12:13.042 --> 12:14.417
I mean, be more
visually dramatic.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.166
Why is he talking about
anything, Savannah?

12:16.166 --> 12:18.083
Where'd you find this loser?

12:18.083 --> 12:21.167
Oh, right.
He's Marti's hand-me-down.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.417
Hey!

12:22.417 --> 12:24.792
You mean like Lewis
handed you down to Jake?

12:24.792 --> 12:27.542
[chuckles]
What do you know?

12:27.542 --> 12:29.917
We're all following some
confused virgin getting high

12:29.917 --> 12:32.000
just 'cause some guy
actually looked at her.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.667
I may not be easy like you--

12:33.667 --> 12:35.291
Do we need to be
getting personal here?

12:35.291 --> 12:36.750
This is personal.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.208
There's a lot
riding on this bid video.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.917
Scholarships are on the line.
Yours included!

12:40.917 --> 12:42.834
[Lewis]
Is that a joke?

12:42.834 --> 12:45.083
Since when did you ever care
about anybody's scholarship?

12:45.083 --> 12:47.750
I care about the team, Lewis.

12:47.750 --> 12:49.458
And that includes you.

12:49.458 --> 12:52.209
And that's why I think this
should be a group decision.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.375
All those in favor
of playing it safe

12:55.375 --> 12:59.125
and doing the video the way
it has always been done

12:59.125 --> 13:00.834
raise your hands.

13:07.041 --> 13:09.042
[gasps]

13:09.042 --> 13:11.209
[whispers]
Oh!

13:11.209 --> 13:14.000
I'm the captain,
I like Dan's ideas.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.291
We're doing them.

13:15.291 --> 13:17.333
[chuckles] I'm not going
to let you bulldoze us.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.125
-Where are you going?
-Over your head, to Vanessa.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.875
Alice, don't do this.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.667
Alice!

13:23.667 --> 13:25.042
Take five, everyone!

13:25.042 --> 13:26.375
Make it ten!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.375
[sighs]

13:29.792 --> 13:31.417
How could you vote
against Savannah?

13:32.542 --> 13:34.291
I was kinda voting
against you.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.084
Why?

13:36.084 --> 13:38.500
I don't know what
makes a cheerleading
video good or bad.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.083
Move the camera,
shoot it on the moon.

13:40.083 --> 13:43.083
Whatever, but I do know
that if your plan backfires

13:43.083 --> 13:44.875
the bobbleheads
will blame Savannah,

13:44.875 --> 13:46.792
they will blame you,
and they will blame me.

13:46.792 --> 13:48.375
That's a pretty
gigantic assumption.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.750
I brought you to Cheertown.

13:49.750 --> 13:50.917
So you're my responsibility.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.291
I'm trying to help.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.792
Savannah asked for my advice,
so I gave it.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.333
Do you think
she'd ask for your advice

13:56.333 --> 13:58.625
if you weren't her boyfriend?

13:58.625 --> 14:00.167
Does it matter?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.208
[sighs]

14:02.333 --> 14:04.208
See, the Hellcats
are the Beatles.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.542
Savannah is John Lennon.
Alice is co-captain.

14:06.542 --> 14:08.209
So she's Paul McCartney.

14:08.209 --> 14:11.125
They've got this rivalry going
that has to be kept in check

14:11.125 --> 14:12.458
or could break up the band.

14:12.458 --> 14:15.375
But you...you're not
really in the band.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.834
John listens to your ideas,
not because they're
right or wrong

14:17.834 --> 14:19.959
but more because
you're showering together.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.208
I don't think I care
for this particular metaphor.

14:22.208 --> 14:25.708
Sorry, dude.
You're Yoko.

14:25.708 --> 14:29.125
I'm not gonna help you
break up the world's greatest
rock and roll band.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.000
-Okay?
-Red. Red!

14:38.000 --> 14:39.333
Alright, I'll see you
at practice.

14:41.167 --> 14:43.875
Hmm. I had a feeling
you'd come looking for me.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.875
-How's your chin?
-It hurts.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.750
Good.

14:47.750 --> 14:49.708
I'd heard Derrick was mature
and level-headed

14:49.708 --> 14:52.209
so you can imagine my surprise

14:52.209 --> 14:54.000
when he flew off
the handle like that.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.250
You've never been
surprised by anything.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.708
In your life.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.208
Are you saying
I did this on purpose?

14:58.208 --> 14:59.917
It occurred to me.

14:59.917 --> 15:02.417
[chuckles] Well, if so, that
makes Derrick the sucker.

15:02.417 --> 15:04.208
If not, he's a violent guy
who flies off

15:04.208 --> 15:06.125
the handle when challenged.

15:06.125 --> 15:07.875
Begs the question.

15:07.875 --> 15:09.500
The kind of fellow
you wanna be with?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.209
Derrick's a good man.

15:11.209 --> 15:13.417
He's a dedicated,
talented doctor.

15:13.417 --> 15:15.209
He works hard and
I don't want you

15:15.209 --> 15:17.041
doing anything
to hurt his career.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.042
Promise me.

15:19.042 --> 15:21.542
I promise I won't do anything
to hurt his career.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.667
-You have my word.
-Thank you.

15:25.667 --> 15:28.125
You look really good,
by the way.

15:28.125 --> 15:30.125
-Vanessa, we have a problem.
-Yeah, you.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.125
She is out of control.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.000
Looks like you have
bigger fish to fry.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.083
Top of the day, coach.

15:36.083 --> 15:39.708
-Ladies.
-Okay, my office, now!

15:39.708 --> 15:41.166
She shouldn't even
be the captain.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.708
I was elected fair and square!

15:42.708 --> 15:44.083
Only because
Vanessa strong-armed

15:44.083 --> 15:45.417
everyone into voting for you!

15:45.417 --> 15:46.917
Well, I did not
strong-arm anyone.

15:46.917 --> 15:49.167
You're delusional,
people didn't vote for you

15:49.167 --> 15:50.500
because they don't
like you, Alice!

15:50.500 --> 15:52.667
-They never have!
-Okay! That's enough.

15:52.667 --> 15:55.542
This video has to be in
the judge's hands in 48 hours.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.667
We don't have time
to be at each other's throats.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.125
We need to work together
as a team.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.750
Tell that to her. She's the
one screwing up the bid video!

16:01.750 --> 16:03.959
-That's a matter of opinion!
-Either approach is valid.

16:03.959 --> 16:07.084
I've seen both of them work.
So you have a choice to make.

16:07.084 --> 16:09.625
Which is why we elected
a captain, to unite and lead.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.834
-Exactly.
-So you're taking her side.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.291
You don't have to
like the direction

16:13.291 --> 16:15.458
but you do have to follow
the captain's lead.

16:15.458 --> 16:17.084
With a big smile on your face.

16:17.084 --> 16:18.125
Got it?

16:20.875 --> 16:22.250
Got it.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.125
Go spread that gospel.

16:27.125 --> 16:28.458
Hold on, Savannah.

16:31.208 --> 16:32.458
How close was the vote?

16:33.834 --> 16:36.500
-About half and half.
-You're losing them.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.333
Well, it's their
responsibility to keep up.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.834
And it's your
responsibility to lead.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.583
Cheerleading is
about teamwork.

16:42.583 --> 16:44.583
When you throw a flier
25 feet in the air

16:44.583 --> 16:46.000
what keeps her smiling?

16:47.166 --> 16:49.625
Trust. She knows her teammates
will catch her.

16:49.625 --> 16:53.167
That's right. So if the
team doesn't trust you,

16:53.167 --> 16:55.000
the whole squad falls apart.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.917
I'd work on that.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.165
[cell phone ringing]

17:11.834 --> 17:14.250
-Hey, Bill.
-You punched my coach?

17:14.250 --> 17:16.041
Mr. Marshall, I can explain--

17:16.041 --> 17:17.290
What the hell is wrong
with you?

17:17.290 --> 17:20.125
I want your tail
in my office, now!

17:20.125 --> 17:21.416
Well, I'm meeting
with Vanessa, so--

17:21.416 --> 17:22.416
Now!

17:26.916 --> 17:28.416
Oh, hell.

17:30.333 --> 17:31.875
[door opens]

17:31.875 --> 17:33.333
[clears throat]

17:35.166 --> 17:37.125
[dramatic music]

17:43.167 --> 17:44.708
Lancer has a code of conduct.

17:44.708 --> 17:47.209
Faculty brawling
is not the image

17:47.209 --> 17:49.166
we wish to convey
to the boosters.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.625
You have dealt this school

17:51.625 --> 17:53.000
and the university hospital

17:53.000 --> 17:54.708
a black eye.

17:57.333 --> 17:58.750
Effective immediately

17:58.750 --> 18:01.708
you are persona
non grata at Lancer.

18:01.708 --> 18:04.000
You are dead to us,
Dr. Altman.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Dead as disco.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.583
-Bill--
-Hush, Red.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.417
What do you have to say
for yourself?

18:14.417 --> 18:17.084
I shouldn't have
lost my temper, Bill.

18:17.084 --> 18:20.083
-Damn right.
-It was extremely immature.

18:20.083 --> 18:22.542
And for that, I do apologize.

18:22.542 --> 18:26.041
I understand your position,
and, uh, I'll go quietly.

18:26.041 --> 18:28.625
-If you
don't tell him, I will.
-You'll do no such thing.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.291
-Screw you, Bill.
-What's going on?

18:30.291 --> 18:31.959
Derrick, you're
getting promoted.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.000
I'm what?

18:35.500 --> 18:37.084
Thanks a lot, Red.

18:37.084 --> 18:39.167
Trying to have a little fun,
a little horse play

18:39.167 --> 18:41.375
with my new doctor
of athletics

18:41.375 --> 18:43.375
and you have to go
and wreck it.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.375
Wait a second.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.917
You're promoting me?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.542
Yes. You are staff.

18:48.542 --> 18:52.625
Full time, covering all sports
teams, including the Hellcats.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.542
I wouldn't wanna tear you away
from your little lady.

18:55.542 --> 18:58.084
[laughs] I don't know
what to say, Bill.

18:58.084 --> 19:00.583
Well, you can thank
the coach here for
turning the other cheek

19:00.583 --> 19:03.000
and lobbying on your behalf.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.792
But when you came in,
just now, your face?

19:06.792 --> 19:09.166
Hilarious. I had you.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.000
Who wants a drink?

19:13.084 --> 19:15.333
Why would you
help me out like this?

19:16.959 --> 19:19.000
I kinda figured
I owed you one.

19:24.583 --> 19:25.917
He owed you one?

19:25.917 --> 19:27.750
It's a good offer, Vanessa.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.042
Big raise.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.375
This is everything that
I have ever worked towards.

19:31.375 --> 19:33.042
But you're thinking
of accepting?

19:33.042 --> 19:34.542
Could you do that,
work for Red?

19:34.542 --> 19:38.333
I'd be working alongside Red,
but not for him, okay?

19:38.333 --> 19:40.542
Besides, keep your
enemies close, right?

19:40.542 --> 19:43.041
Yeah, he's probably thinking
the same exact thing.

19:43.041 --> 19:45.458
Well, let him. I could
sure handle that guy.

19:45.458 --> 19:46.542
Hmm.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.792
What's that?

19:48.792 --> 19:50.250
What? Hmm, it's a noise.

19:50.250 --> 19:51.750
You think I can't handle
Red Raymond?

19:51.750 --> 19:53.208
-I didn't say that.
-No, really,

19:53.208 --> 19:55.041
I wanna hear this.

19:55.041 --> 19:56.458
He's a coach.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.209
He strategizes for a living.

19:58.209 --> 19:59.959
Well, good for him, Vanessa,
I ranked

19:59.959 --> 20:01.708
nationally on my college
chess team.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.500
Red used to fleece
the speed chess

20:03.500 --> 20:05.167
hustlers that hung out
in Bartlett park.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.834
You don't want to
give him a chance
to get in your head.

20:07.834 --> 20:10.166
-Drive a wedge.
-Between us?

20:10.166 --> 20:12.000
You really think
that little of me?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.125
I just think that
we should talk about it.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.500
Just look at all the angles.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.875
We can talk about it
as much as you want to.

20:17.875 --> 20:20.084
But...right now I'm a little
bit more interested

20:20.084 --> 20:22.000
in this, uh, I don't know,
lack of respect

20:22.000 --> 20:23.500
that I'm feeling from you.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.291
Are you feeling it?

20:25.291 --> 20:28.125
I have enormous respect
for you. I love you.

20:28.125 --> 20:29.917
It's just...

20:29.917 --> 20:32.291
See this?
He's already got us fighting.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.542
Oh, I believe
you've got us fighting.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.209
[sighs]

20:40.834 --> 20:43.708
[murmuring]

20:45.291 --> 20:47.583
Here are the forms
Travis signed.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.167
Thank you.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.291
Was there something else?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.166
Yeah.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.166
He says he's innocent.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.458
Well, they all do.

21:01.458 --> 21:02.834
But he has been tried
and convicted.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.083
That part of the case is over.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.458
Yeah, but if he's
telling the truth,

21:05.458 --> 21:07.041
we need to do something.

21:07.041 --> 21:09.250
Overturning a conviction
is incredibly difficult.

21:09.250 --> 21:11.000
And it's off-topic.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.583
[scoffs]
Off-topic?

21:12.583 --> 21:14.750
Yeah, we're interested in
the punishment, not the crime.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.250
Travis was given
a cruel and unusual

21:16.250 --> 21:17.875
prison sentence
for a minor offense.

21:17.875 --> 21:20.000
Yeah, a minor offense
he may not be guilty of.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.209
Look, he's lost his
whole life, his identity.

21:22.209 --> 21:24.000
Trust me, the man is broken.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.792
If there's even the slightest
chance that he's innocent--

21:25.792 --> 21:27.000
Doing what you're suggesting

21:27.000 --> 21:29.333
requires resources
I don't have.

21:29.333 --> 21:32.500
And Travis is in no position
to pay his own legal bills.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.959
Are you...volunteering to pay?

21:35.583 --> 21:38.125
-No.
-Hmm.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.208
I took this case
to get a law overturned.

21:40.208 --> 21:44.208
An unjust law that victimizes
many, many people. Every year.

21:44.208 --> 21:47.125
What we're doing here
is bigger than Travis.

21:47.125 --> 21:48.708
Well, I thought
you cared about him.

21:48.708 --> 21:51.167
Don't you want
to get him out of prison?

21:51.167 --> 21:53.166
Reducing his sentence
gets him out

21:53.166 --> 21:54.500
while he's still young enough

21:54.500 --> 21:56.000
to enjoy what's left
of his life.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.166
Now, if Travis
doesn't like my game plan

21:58.166 --> 22:01.041
he's more than
welcome to fire me
and find another lawyer.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.667
If you pass
the bar one day...

22:05.917 --> 22:07.792
you can take up his cause.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.000
Why wait till then?

22:16.834 --> 22:19.084
I can't believe you offered
my boyfriend a job!

22:19.084 --> 22:21.250
[chuckles]
You said he was talented.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.042
You promised
to leave him alone!

22:23.042 --> 22:25.167
I promised not to hurt
his career.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.041
I think helping a guy
get a lucrative promotion fits

22:27.041 --> 22:29.333
firmly within both the letter
and spirit of that promise.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.042
Okay, I'm sick of the games.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.041
Me, too.

22:33.041 --> 22:34.792
But you play the hand
that you're dealt.

22:34.792 --> 22:36.291
I'm with Derrick.
I'm not interested.

22:36.291 --> 22:38.042
Why can't you get that
through your head?

22:38.042 --> 22:40.083
And you're walking away.
Why are you walking away?

22:40.083 --> 22:41.667
Because you ask
a fair question.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.000
Sit down.

22:45.083 --> 22:46.708
Sit down.

22:51.792 --> 22:55.125
Ten years ago,
you and I behaved...badly.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.458
People got hurt.

22:57.500 --> 23:00.250
[instrumental music]

23:00.250 --> 23:03.000
Eventually, I came
to terms with it.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
When I got run
out of town on a rail

23:05.000 --> 23:09.042
I realized, it was probably
a blessing in disguise.

23:09.042 --> 23:11.250
Best thing for me to do,
put it all behind me.

23:11.250 --> 23:13.166
Lancer and this
marriage I screwed up

23:13.166 --> 23:15.084
and especially you.

23:15.084 --> 23:17.209
Moving on,
that's healthy.

23:18.291 --> 23:20.333
See, the thing is,
that didn't happen.

23:21.708 --> 23:23.375
I've been in many
relationships since

23:23.375 --> 23:27.166
and...not one of those women
had what you have.

23:28.875 --> 23:33.250
Your kindness. Your strength.
Your immensity of spirit.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.042
Oh, please.

23:35.042 --> 23:37.042
I'm serious.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.417
I don't think that you
realize how unique you are.

23:41.084 --> 23:42.875
But your cheerleaders do.

23:42.875 --> 23:44.333
Red.

23:44.333 --> 23:47.333
Look, Derrick's got the job
that he's always wanted.

23:47.333 --> 23:50.417
Success allows people to
become who they truly are.

23:50.417 --> 23:53.333
And if you're with the
right guy and it's Derrick

23:53.333 --> 23:55.458
you're going to know
soon enough.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.542
But if he's not...

24:00.959 --> 24:03.417
well, I'll be
in the vicinity when
you figure that out.

24:18.084 --> 24:19.917
You were right.
This is visually dramatic.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.208
I know, I mean, look at
these geometric shapes.

24:22.208 --> 24:24.333
It's going to look perfect
up against your pyramids.

24:24.333 --> 24:25.959
You know, cheerleading
is all about spirit.

24:25.959 --> 24:28.333
So it's like,
like an urban cathedral.

24:28.333 --> 24:31.209
You know, and the way
the overpass softens the light

24:31.209 --> 24:33.625
you guys are going

24:33.625 --> 24:35.083

don't you?

24:35.083 --> 24:37.458
Yeah, I do.

24:37.458 --> 24:39.084
Look, just one thing, though.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.875
You sure everyone's okay
with me doing this?

24:43.875 --> 24:45.959
They'll come around when
they see the finished product.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.000
I believe in you.

24:50.000 --> 24:52.000
Okay, then.
Let's do this.

24:53.417 --> 24:54.959
Okay, everybody.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.208

very carefully. I did.

28:54.250 --> 28:57.167
And I just decided there
wasn't much to talk about.

29:01.750 --> 29:03.166
I'll see you at home?

29:14.417 --> 29:16.208
Look, I know
it's a little cutty.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.583
It's a disaster.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.250
Why all the edits?
The stunts look fake.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.084
You guys never got
the stunts perfect.

29:21.084 --> 29:23.083
I had to cut between
performances to make it work

29:23.083 --> 29:25.000
and to remove the cursing.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.750
Everybody looks so angry.

29:30.042 --> 29:33.042
Man, I've been texting you
for an hour.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.000
We've been dealing with
the bid video. What's wrong?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.209
-I mean, what else is wrong?
-Look, you need a heads-up.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.458
Now, there's a squad meeting
happening over at Carter Hall.

29:40.458 --> 29:41.875
Alice, she's staging a coup.

29:41.875 --> 29:43.375
She's calling
a no-confidence vote.

29:43.375 --> 29:45.083
"No confidence" in what?

29:47.125 --> 29:48.875
In me.

29:48.875 --> 29:51.875
Come on, man. Find Marti.
Savannah's gonna
need her vote.

29:55.208 --> 29:58.084
We all know
the bid video crapped out.

29:58.084 --> 30:00.125
She'll put a spin on it,
but come on.

30:00.125 --> 30:02.042
We need new blood.

30:02.042 --> 30:03.375
Did I miss a memo?

30:04.625 --> 30:07.417
The squad isn't happy.

30:07.417 --> 30:09.792
Article three of the CCAA
Cheer Constitution

30:09.792 --> 30:12.667
says that we can call
a no-confidence vote.

30:12.667 --> 30:14.417
A two-thirds majority
puts you out.

30:14.417 --> 30:17.250
-And you in?
-I'm the second.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.166
You all know
I've got seniority.

30:19.166 --> 30:22.625
I realize I may not be
the most popular
person around here.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.041
But this is not
a popularity contest.

30:25.041 --> 30:27.542
This is about doing
what is best for the team.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.583
And what's best is a change.

30:29.583 --> 30:32.000
Right here, right now.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.375
Like me or not, I will put
this team back on track.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.000
I promise you that.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.084
But shouldn't we actually see
the bid video

30:38.084 --> 30:39.542
before making up our minds?

30:39.542 --> 30:41.708
-Yeah.
-Fair enough.

30:43.333 --> 30:45.625
Savannah,
how is the bid video?

30:45.625 --> 30:47.708
Do you have any footage
to show us?

30:52.625 --> 30:54.209
Alice is right.

30:55.084 --> 30:56.792
It's terrible.

30:59.792 --> 31:02.375
She's also right about me
being a bad leader.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.333
I felt like people
were attacking Dan

31:05.333 --> 31:08.875
and I got emotional
and I steamrolled you all.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.834
I thought Dan's ideas
were good.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.125
I still do.

31:14.084 --> 31:16.125
But I failed to inspire you.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.834
I let the team fracture.
So, for that...yeah.

31:22.125 --> 31:24.333
I deserve to be replaced.

31:26.208 --> 31:27.625
I make a motion to call

31:27.625 --> 31:30.000
a no-confidence vote
in our captain.

31:30.000 --> 31:33.084
-Do I have a second?
-Second.

31:33.084 --> 31:35.458
Is the video really that bad?

31:37.166 --> 31:39.166
The moves weren't there.

31:39.166 --> 31:42.291
But the worst part was
is that it wasn't fun
to watch.

31:42.291 --> 31:44.000
There is no heart.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.667
No joy.

31:45.667 --> 31:47.125
Can't we redo it?

31:47.125 --> 31:49.166
We can't make the deadline
to FedEx it.

31:49.166 --> 31:51.125
Pickup is in ten minutes
from now.

31:53.708 --> 31:56.042
-Plane.
-What?

31:56.042 --> 31:57.458
We buy a plane ticket.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.458
One of us flies with
the submission packet

31:59.458 --> 32:01.417
and we carry it
into the national office

32:01.417 --> 32:02.959
in Aspen when
it opens tomorrow.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.209
That's...genius.

32:06.209 --> 32:08.667
We need to find out when
the last flight takes off.

32:08.667 --> 32:10.000
-Uh, Frankie?
-On it.

32:10.000 --> 32:11.417
-[Savannah] Okay.
-Wait.

32:11.417 --> 32:12.708
You're going with my idea?

32:12.708 --> 32:14.708
That's a good idea. Yes.

32:14.708 --> 32:19.917
Okay. So, the last flight
to Aspen takes off at 7:40.

32:19.917 --> 32:21.166
It's ten to 6:00 now.

32:21.166 --> 32:24.333
Which means no time
to edit or add music.

32:24.333 --> 32:27.542
We do it old school.
Stationary camera on a tripod.

32:27.542 --> 32:30.208
Plug directly into the camera
and lay the music track live.

32:30.208 --> 32:33.209
Dan has the graphics built.
Darwin, how's your sprain?

32:33.209 --> 32:36.167
I've been icing it. I can
probably make it through once.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.792
Perfect. We don't have time
for more than once.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.333
Look who I found
at the bus stop.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.125
I had a thing to do
for law class.

32:42.125 --> 32:44.084
It can wait.
Did I miss the vote?

32:44.084 --> 32:45.750
-No, no vote.
-Not yet.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.708
We can do this, guys, but
only if we're in it together.

32:48.708 --> 32:50.959
Agreed. And afterwards?

32:50.959 --> 32:52.750
We vote. Punch it?
