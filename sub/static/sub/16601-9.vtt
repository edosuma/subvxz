WEBVTT

00:11.533 --> 00:14.035
Okay, ready?
Here we go.

00:14.037 --> 00:17.638
One Mississippi,
two Mississippi,

00:17.640 --> 00:21.509
three Mississippi,
four Mississippi...

00:21.511 --> 00:23.344
No peeking!
...five Mississippi,

00:23.346 --> 00:25.480
six Mississippi,

00:25.482 --> 00:29.450
seven Mississippi,
eight Mississippi,

00:29.452 --> 00:31.552
nine Mississippi...

00:31.554 --> 00:33.521
ten Mississippi...

00:33.523 --> 00:35.857
eleven Mississ...

00:35.859 --> 00:37.992
Jack?

00:37.994 --> 00:40.261
Jack!

00:40.263 --> 00:42.130
Jack, I can't see you.
Where are you?

00:42.132 --> 00:43.498
Daddy, over here!

00:43.500 --> 00:44.866
What is it?
Wh-What happened?

00:44.868 --> 00:46.601
You all right?

00:48.000 --> 00:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.445 --> 00:58.045
You almost ready?

00:58.047 --> 00:59.713
I'm getting dressed.

00:59.715 --> 01:01.849
In that case,
you need some help?

01:01.851 --> 01:04.785
Ha! Stay right where
you are, Mr. Reagan.

01:04.787 --> 01:06.454
Why does it take women
so long to get ready?

01:06.456 --> 01:07.688
Do you think this is easy?

01:07.690 --> 01:09.457
Who knows how to
dress for a midweek

01:09.459 --> 01:11.125
Long Island
destination wedding?

01:11.127 --> 01:13.661
I'm not sure ten stops out
on the LIRR

01:13.663 --> 01:15.362
count as a destination.

01:15.364 --> 01:17.364
If I'm staying at a hotel

01:17.366 --> 01:19.099
it's a destination.

01:20.302 --> 01:22.736
Hey, I mentioned tonight is just
the rehearsal dinner right?

01:22.738 --> 01:24.538
You can save the big guns
for tomorrow's wedding.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.574
I did.

01:26.576 --> 01:29.410
This is just
the appetizer.

01:29.412 --> 01:31.612
What do you think?

01:31.614 --> 01:34.248
I think if I was the bride
I'm calling in sick,

01:34.250 --> 01:35.783
'cause you're gonna
steal the show.

01:35.785 --> 01:37.685
You don't look too shabby
yourself, Mr. Reagan.

01:37.687 --> 01:39.653
Yeah, thanks.

01:39.655 --> 01:42.923
I know I'm just the stand-in;
we're going as friends.

01:43.692 --> 01:45.025
As partners.
Yeah, just a couple

01:45.027 --> 01:46.961
off-duty cops attending
a wedding together.

01:46.963 --> 01:48.696
Is that okay?

01:48.698 --> 01:50.231
Sure.

01:51.566 --> 01:53.801
Let's do this.

01:59.774 --> 02:02.209
Commissioner,
Father Phil's here.

02:03.545 --> 02:04.812
Father Phil.

02:04.814 --> 02:07.181
Welcome to the 14th
floor of One PP.

02:07.183 --> 02:08.449
Thank you for seeing me,

02:08.451 --> 02:09.324
Commissioner.

02:09.348 --> 02:10.585
Come on.
It's still Frank.

02:10.586 --> 02:11.986
Well, it's just that
I've never seen you

02:11.988 --> 02:13.521
with all the trappings
of your office.

02:13.523 --> 02:15.523
Well, we could toss
that football around,

02:15.525 --> 02:17.091
make this more
like usual?

02:17.093 --> 02:19.159
Nah, nah, we're good.
- Sit down.

02:19.161 --> 02:22.062
Coffee?
- Black, please.

02:22.064 --> 02:24.698
And, thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

02:24.700 --> 02:26.166
How is your
fundraising going?

02:26.168 --> 02:27.434
You getting new uniforms?

02:27.436 --> 02:29.770
And jerseys, yeah.
Thanks to your help.

02:29.772 --> 02:32.273
Well, a few phone calls.

02:32.275 --> 02:35.042
Nothing more.

02:35.044 --> 02:37.545
So...

02:38.780 --> 02:42.449
You know, I'm usually on the
other side of this conversation.

02:42.451 --> 02:44.451
Well, I always wondered
what it would be like

02:44.453 --> 02:46.623
sitting on your side
of the confessional screen.

02:46.647 --> 02:47.355
Yes.

02:47.356 --> 02:50.758
I'm very often
grateful for the screen

02:50.760 --> 02:53.727
as much as the penitent is.

02:53.729 --> 02:56.363
But if you were the guy
in my seat

02:56.365 --> 02:58.966
you'd be telling the guy in your
seat to spit it out already.

02:58.968 --> 03:01.669
I'm stalling, I know.

03:07.910 --> 03:12.112
There's a 15-year-old-boy in
our parish who's gone missing.

03:12.114 --> 03:14.748
How long has he been missing?

03:14.750 --> 03:16.317
48 hours.

03:16.319 --> 03:19.053
Have the parents filed
a missing persons report?

03:19.055 --> 03:20.254
They have.

03:20.256 --> 03:21.989
I'll talk to
the precinct commander.

03:21.991 --> 03:23.290
Well, no.
It's not that.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.492
The-the police, they're
doing the best they can

03:25.494 --> 03:28.729
with... what they have.

03:28.731 --> 03:32.733
What don't they have,
that you do?

03:32.735 --> 03:37.171
I know where the boy
is being held.

03:37.173 --> 03:38.772
Where?

03:38.774 --> 03:40.774
I can't say.

03:40.776 --> 03:43.277
Your voice is working just fine,
Father.

03:43.279 --> 03:45.913
I was told of his whereabouts
during a confession.

03:47.182 --> 03:51.151
I'm bound by
the sacramental seal.

04:01.162 --> 04:03.197
Hey, there's a homeless shelter
a few blocks from here.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.665
Maybe she's from there?

04:04.667 --> 04:06.734
How many homeless people you
know got a French manicure?

04:06.736 --> 04:09.003
Yeah, this is no bottle blonde.

04:09.005 --> 04:11.405
With fancy jewelry
and Park Avenue teeth.

04:11.407 --> 04:12.773
She's not homeless.

04:12.775 --> 04:15.809
She's not a Jane Doe, either.
I recognize her.

04:15.811 --> 04:18.045
This is Lindsey Wentworth.

04:18.047 --> 04:20.014
Somebody I'm
supposed to know?

04:20.016 --> 04:21.515
Nah. She's a socialite.

04:21.517 --> 04:23.183
He's right. She is.

04:23.185 --> 04:24.385
How do you know that?

04:24.387 --> 04:26.553
<i>My wife loves Page Six.</i>

04:58.208 --> 05:01.242
Um, you were saying that you
were meeting another couple...

05:02.340 --> 05:04.620
Yeah. We were, supposed
to be meeting friends

05:04.621 --> 05:06.154
for dinner at Bouchon,

05:06.156 --> 05:08.323
and when she didn't show,
I started calling her,

05:08.325 --> 05:10.458
but it kept going
straight to voicemail.

05:10.460 --> 05:12.227
Was it like your
wife to go missing

05:12.229 --> 05:14.029
for long periods of time?

05:14.031 --> 05:16.197
No. She was
always very prompt.

05:16.199 --> 05:18.833
So that's why,
when she didn't show,

05:18.835 --> 05:19.801
I called the cops.

05:19.803 --> 05:22.470
Right. And that
was at 10:00 p.m.

05:22.472 --> 05:23.638
Yeah. That's right.

05:23.640 --> 05:25.440
The person I spoke to

05:25.442 --> 05:28.009
said that they couldn't take
a missing persons report.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.412
They'd keep an eye out for her.
All right.

05:30.414 --> 05:31.646
And you were meeting
another couple.

05:31.648 --> 05:33.348
Would it be possible
for us to speak to them?

05:33.350 --> 05:34.983
Yeah, sure.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.522
It was,

05:40.524 --> 05:43.458
Lindsey's sister, Elaine
and, her husband John.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.660
I hate

05:45.662 --> 05:46.995
to ask you this right now,

05:46.997 --> 05:48.496
I know this is a
difficult time for you,

05:48.498 --> 05:51.566
but were you and Lindsey having
any kind of problems at all?

05:51.568 --> 05:53.435
No. Not at all.
Nothing like that.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.203
Um...

05:56.238 --> 05:58.239
This is her cell.

05:58.241 --> 05:59.674
You can check
the text messages

05:59.676 --> 06:01.876
between us, you'll see things
were great with us.

06:01.878 --> 06:03.411
She didn't have her phone
with her?

06:03.413 --> 06:05.680
She did
that sometimes.

06:05.682 --> 06:07.115
You know, if she was,
exercising

06:07.117 --> 06:08.516
or-or just going for a walk.

06:08.518 --> 06:10.352
She called it cutting the cord.

06:10.354 --> 06:12.687
Well, thank you for this,

06:12.689 --> 06:16.625
and, um, we'll be in touch
as soon as we hear anything.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.493
Again, sorry for your loss.

06:18.495 --> 06:20.161
Thank you.

06:20.163 --> 06:22.530
What was with that look
you gave me?

06:22.532 --> 06:24.032
This.

06:24.034 --> 06:25.333
What? Something
in the texts?

06:25.335 --> 06:26.534
I remembered at
the crime scene,

06:26.536 --> 06:27.869
when they were
bagging the evidence,

06:27.871 --> 06:29.571
Lindsey had a cell
phone in her pocket.

06:29.573 --> 06:30.705
She's got two phones?

06:30.707 --> 06:32.741
Yeah, but her husband
only knows about this one.

06:32.743 --> 06:34.342
So you think she
was having an affair.

06:34.344 --> 06:38.079
If anyone knows about
that, it's her sister.

06:39.615 --> 06:41.249
There's very little in here

06:41.251 --> 06:44.352
about results from
canvassing the neighborhood.

06:44.354 --> 06:46.021
They're a little hamstrung
there, boss.

06:46.023 --> 06:47.555
Hamstrung how?

06:47.557 --> 06:49.524
Well, there's no clear
"last-seen."

06:49.526 --> 06:51.359
And all the day-of contacts
the kid had

06:51.361 --> 06:52.894
were completely ordinary.

06:52.896 --> 06:55.497
Well, the kid's gone missing,
which is extraordinary.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.766
Well, there's no evidence
of an abduction,

06:57.768 --> 06:59.968
no ransom demands
or even contact.

06:59.970 --> 07:01.536
It's only been 48 hours.

07:01.538 --> 07:03.371
Which is well past
the usual time frame

07:03.373 --> 07:05.040
for the reach-out
for a kidnapping.

07:05.042 --> 07:06.808
I mean, he could have
just taken a hike,

07:06.810 --> 07:09.711
or, God forbid, committed
suicide somewhere out of sight.

07:09.713 --> 07:12.280
Nothing in his profile
suggests...

07:12.282 --> 07:14.049
Well, nothing suggests
anything, that's my point.

07:14.051 --> 07:15.417
Where do we even start?

07:15.419 --> 07:16.418
I got to ask...

07:16.420 --> 07:17.552
Ask.
- I'm not seeing

07:17.554 --> 07:19.688
what it is about this case
puts it on top

07:19.690 --> 07:21.556
of the pile of the PC's desk.

07:21.558 --> 07:24.325
A friend asked me
to look into it.

07:24.327 --> 07:25.860
A relative of the kid?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.762
No.

07:27.764 --> 07:29.197
Is there something
this friend said

07:29.199 --> 07:30.498
that might help us out here?

07:30.500 --> 07:32.400
Don't you think I'd share it
if there was?

07:32.402 --> 07:35.103
I'm sorry, boss. I'm just--
I'm a little confused.

07:35.105 --> 07:37.772
Me, too. Could you be a little
less enigmatic?

07:38.607 --> 07:41.710
My friend is bound
by a kind of oath

07:41.712 --> 07:45.680
in regards to sharing what
he knows about the situation.

07:45.682 --> 07:47.382
Like a mob thing?

07:48.784 --> 07:50.318
No. Not a mob thing.

07:50.320 --> 07:53.588
But just as strict and severe
in terms of the consequences

07:53.590 --> 07:55.824
of telling what he knows.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.125
I don't get it.

07:57.127 --> 08:00.195
If he can't tell us anything,
why did he come see you?

08:02.364 --> 08:05.500
He wants to help but he
just doesn't know how.

08:21.217 --> 08:22.617
Is that the bride-to-be?

08:22.619 --> 08:25.954
The future
Mrs. Rotkowski.

08:25.956 --> 08:27.756
She looks beautiful, man.

08:27.758 --> 08:29.224
As does your date.

08:29.226 --> 08:31.593
We're just partners.

08:31.595 --> 08:33.962
I'm sorry.

08:33.964 --> 08:35.096
No, it's-it's fine.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.197
Happens all the time.

08:36.198 --> 08:38.265
I, for one, am thrilled
to hear this news.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.068
What's that?

08:40.070 --> 08:41.535
She's single.

08:41.538 --> 08:42.904
Great to meet you... Derek.

08:42.905 --> 08:45.440
Eddie.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.575
Love it. Something so hot
when a girl

08:47.577 --> 08:49.244
- has a boy's name.
- Everyone,

08:49.246 --> 08:51.746
Derek is my partner,
and, as you can see,

08:51.748 --> 08:53.014
he's painfully shy.

08:53.016 --> 08:54.949
This is Jamie.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.384
We used to work
together in the city.

08:57.587 --> 08:58.953
You guys are NYPD.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.789
That's right.
Hey, how many

09:00.791 --> 09:02.690
NYPD cops does it take
to change a light bulb?

09:02.692 --> 09:04.893
Thanks, but I'll pass.

09:04.895 --> 09:07.996
Derek.
What? It's just a joke.

09:07.998 --> 09:09.097
Fine, I'll bite, how many?

09:09.099 --> 09:10.498
Six. One to do it,

09:10.500 --> 09:12.100
five to smash the old bulb.

09:13.336 --> 09:14.736
Seriously? You think
that's funny?

09:14.738 --> 09:16.604
Did you come up with that
all by yourself, Derek?

09:16.606 --> 09:19.874
No. I read it online.
He's just kidding, guys.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.943
Must be nice to have that kind

09:21.945 --> 09:23.444
of time on your hands.

09:23.446 --> 09:25.013
Guess that's what happens when
all you have to do all day

09:25.015 --> 09:26.481
is write a couple
speeding tickets.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.117
You think we don't do
real police work out here?

09:29.119 --> 09:30.451
Nah, we carry Glocks
in our holsters,

09:30.453 --> 09:32.287
not radar guns, but...
You think that's funny?

09:32.289 --> 09:33.755
I think it's funnier
than your lame joke.

09:33.757 --> 09:34.889
Okay, that's enough.

09:34.891 --> 09:37.192
Everybody settle down
and have a drink.

09:37.194 --> 09:39.060
This is a party.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.628
Let's party.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.834
Hey.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.869
Forget about him,
let's go dance.

09:47.871 --> 09:49.437
Nah. I'm a terrible dancer.

09:49.439 --> 09:52.373
You don't have to be good,
you just have to be fun.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.977
I'm gonna have
another drink instead.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.756
Lindsey's husband said
he met you for dinner,

10:08.758 --> 10:10.225
but that Lindsey didn't show up.

10:10.227 --> 10:12.327
That's right.

10:12.329 --> 10:15.930
Can I ask you how Stuart
seemed that night?

10:15.932 --> 10:17.098
He was concerned.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.734
It wasn't like her to just
not show up.

10:19.736 --> 10:21.035
He called her
a bunch of times.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.403
We all did.

10:22.405 --> 10:24.806
And after about,
half an hour?

10:24.808 --> 10:26.608
He insisted
on calling the police.

10:26.610 --> 10:28.776
What was your impression
of their marriage,

10:28.778 --> 10:30.879
if you don't mind me asking?
Great.

10:30.881 --> 10:31.813
Very happy.

10:31.815 --> 10:33.781
Stuart was crazy
about Lindsey.

10:33.783 --> 10:36.718
They had a-a very good marriage,
better than most.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.886
Isn't that right?

10:37.888 --> 10:40.655
No question.

10:40.657 --> 10:42.123
That's good.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.959
Then why do you think
it is that...

10:44.961 --> 10:47.161
she had a second cell phone?

10:48.030 --> 10:49.397
Didn't know
that she did.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.033
Yeah, her husband
didn't know that either.

10:52.035 --> 10:53.434
I didn't know either.

10:53.436 --> 10:54.969
Really? Well,
that's interesting,

10:54.971 --> 10:56.838
because I checked
her cell phone records,

10:56.840 --> 11:00.708
and both cells had calls
from you.

11:06.415 --> 11:07.382
Sweetie,

11:07.384 --> 11:09.717
can you give me a minute?

11:09.719 --> 11:11.319
Yeah.

11:11.321 --> 11:13.488
Sure.

11:19.061 --> 11:22.363
You want to tell me
what's going on?

11:22.365 --> 11:25.233
Lindsey had a secret.

11:25.235 --> 11:27.402
Yeah, k-kind of gathered
that much.

11:27.404 --> 11:29.404
You have to swear you won't tell
anything to Stuart.

11:29.406 --> 11:30.538
This would kill him,

11:30.540 --> 11:31.906
not to mention
her children.

11:31.908 --> 11:34.575
She was having an affair?
- No.

11:35.844 --> 11:38.379
She was a hooker.

11:40.049 --> 11:41.549
What?

11:41.551 --> 11:43.484
Well, a...

11:43.486 --> 11:47.522
high-priced call girl, anyway.

12:03.059 --> 12:05.761
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

12:05.763 --> 12:08.964
It has been three months
since my last confession.

12:08.966 --> 12:10.632
These are my sins.

12:10.634 --> 12:13.936
I have sinned in
thought and in deed.

12:13.938 --> 12:16.471
I have to ask a man
something I have

12:16.473 --> 12:18.340
no right to ask of him.
- Frank...

12:18.342 --> 12:21.109
And if he refuses,
I cannot accept it.

12:21.111 --> 12:25.180
Is what you want of value
for him

12:25.182 --> 12:27.416
or just for you?

12:27.418 --> 12:29.551
It is of value to both of us.

12:29.553 --> 12:33.355
But most importantly to a
15-year-old boy and his family.

12:33.357 --> 12:34.823
No.

12:34.825 --> 12:37.492
I am asking a man,

12:37.494 --> 12:38.994
a good man,

12:38.996 --> 12:41.730
to break his oath
to save a boy's life.

12:41.732 --> 12:43.031
I am not a man.

12:43.033 --> 12:44.333
I'm a priest.

12:44.335 --> 12:46.568
You are both.

12:53.109 --> 12:54.610
Father, wait.

13:00.450 --> 13:02.084
You're right.

13:02.086 --> 13:04.419
You have no right
to ask that of me.

13:04.421 --> 13:06.788
I know. And yet I'm asking.

13:06.790 --> 13:08.290
If I do what you're suggesting,

13:08.292 --> 13:10.459
that is a violation
of my holy oath.

13:10.461 --> 13:13.261
Father, it's just you and me
standing here.

13:13.263 --> 13:14.463
Wrong, Frank.

13:14.465 --> 13:16.198
There's a third.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.000
He is always standing with us.

13:18.002 --> 13:20.102
Yes, our most merciful God...

13:20.104 --> 13:21.536
Whose seal of the confessional
is a duty

13:21.538 --> 13:22.871
I'm charged with protecting.

13:22.873 --> 13:24.506
And that boy

13:24.508 --> 13:27.576
I am charged with protecting.
Then find him.

13:27.578 --> 13:29.711
That's the duty
you're charged with.

13:29.713 --> 13:31.880
Then help me.

13:31.882 --> 13:34.082
I just did.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.791
<i>According to her sister,</i>

13:42.793 --> 13:45.494
she was on a girls' trip
a couple years ago to Vegas.

13:45.496 --> 13:49.197
She got drunk and ended up
cheating on her husband.

13:49.199 --> 13:51.133
That's an affair,
not prostitution.

13:51.135 --> 13:53.168
But it's Vegas, you know?
She got all dolled up.

13:53.170 --> 13:54.436
She looks like a million bucks.

13:54.438 --> 13:55.771
The guy assumed she was a pro,

13:55.773 --> 13:57.939
so he slides her a few hundreds
when they're done.

13:57.941 --> 13:59.574
What? I would've
smacked him in his face.

13:59.576 --> 14:00.842
That's exactly
what she did.

14:00.844 --> 14:02.477
But later on,
on the plane,

14:02.479 --> 14:04.579
she starts replaying the
whole evening in her head

14:04.581 --> 14:06.248
and getting
turned on by it.

14:06.250 --> 14:08.283
And next thing you know,
she takes a solo trip

14:08.285 --> 14:09.518
to the Mile High Club.

14:09.520 --> 14:10.852
Shut up.

14:10.854 --> 14:12.688
Right from her sister's mouth.

14:12.690 --> 14:14.956
Apparently Lindsey
discovered some kinky side

14:14.958 --> 14:16.692
that she never
knew she had.

14:16.694 --> 14:19.127
So, what, she comes home
and she starts hooking?

14:19.129 --> 14:21.430
No, not right away. But
eventually she finds herself

14:21.432 --> 14:23.432
getting in touch with
a high-end agency.

14:23.434 --> 14:24.900
One thing leads
to another.

14:24.902 --> 14:27.302
I swear, no matter how many
years I spend in this city,

14:27.304 --> 14:29.638
it's always got another
crazy surprise up its sleeve.

14:29.640 --> 14:33.075
Eight million stories...

14:35.179 --> 14:37.779
$5,000 a night?

14:37.781 --> 14:39.347
An hour, dear.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.149
Margaret Middleton girls
are one of a kind,

14:41.151 --> 14:43.952
each one uniquely qualified
to provide our clients

14:43.954 --> 14:45.854
with a memorable experience.

14:45.856 --> 14:48.523
Well,
my wife is uniquely qualified

14:48.525 --> 14:50.659
to provide me
with a memorable experience,

14:50.661 --> 14:52.427
and it doesn't cost me
five grand.

14:52.429 --> 14:55.230
Our clients are
high-end executives,

14:55.232 --> 14:57.299
very discerning.
They come to us

14:57.301 --> 15:00.435
because only we can provide them
with both discretion and access

15:00.437 --> 15:01.770
to the most beautiful

15:01.772 --> 15:03.171
and refined women
in the world.

15:03.173 --> 15:04.372
How much discretion?

15:04.374 --> 15:06.374
- I don't follow.
- Well, a john is a john.

15:06.376 --> 15:09.111
Whether he's in a pin-striped
suit or a sweat suit,

15:09.113 --> 15:11.079
he's still
just a john.

15:11.081 --> 15:14.716
Are any of your high-end johns
into smacking

15:14.718 --> 15:15.717
girls around?

15:15.719 --> 15:16.852
Our girls come first.

15:16.854 --> 15:19.254
Any client deemed undesirable
for any reason

15:19.256 --> 15:20.889
has their membership revoked.

15:20.891 --> 15:23.825
Were any of Lindsey's johns
deemed undesirable

15:23.827 --> 15:26.294
and had their memberships
revoked?

15:26.296 --> 15:27.929
Like I said,

15:27.931 --> 15:31.199
discretion is paramount
at Margaret Middleton.

15:31.201 --> 15:33.335
I'm not at liberty
to divulge names of clients

15:33.337 --> 15:35.437
or former clients.
- Well,

15:35.439 --> 15:37.205
which is more paramount to you,

15:37.207 --> 15:41.243
keeping your discretion
or keeping your business?

15:45.047 --> 15:47.549
His name is Gordon Rykert.

15:47.551 --> 15:51.019
Okay. What can you tell me
about Mr. Gordon Rykert?

15:52.688 --> 15:56.391
He grew infatuated
with Lindsey-- or Kate,

15:56.393 --> 15:57.759
as she's known here.

15:57.761 --> 16:00.395
Offered $100,000
for exclusivity.

16:00.397 --> 16:01.897
She wasn't interested.

16:01.899 --> 16:02.964
Bet he didn't like that.

16:02.966 --> 16:05.901
We had an unpleasant exchange
of e-mails

16:05.903 --> 16:07.202
over the matter.

16:07.204 --> 16:09.905
In the end, it was a mutual
decision to part company.

16:09.907 --> 16:11.373
He make threats?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.208
Like I said, it...

16:13.210 --> 16:16.545
was an unpleasant conversation.

16:20.683 --> 16:23.585
May I ask what this is about?

16:23.587 --> 16:25.320
We're just
curious.

16:25.322 --> 16:28.523
You're just curious
where I was at 8:00 on Monday.

16:28.525 --> 16:30.225
Just curious.

16:32.061 --> 16:34.462
Well, I was
probably at the gym.

16:34.464 --> 16:35.831
Probably?

16:35.833 --> 16:38.567
I go there most nights
after work.

16:38.569 --> 16:40.502
This was just
two nights ago.

16:40.504 --> 16:42.604
Were you at the gym
two nights ago?

16:42.606 --> 16:44.606
I'm sorry, but,

16:44.608 --> 16:47.175
I'm just not comfortable
answering these questions

16:47.177 --> 16:49.010
without knowing the nature
of your inquiry.

16:49.012 --> 16:52.747
Okay, well, here's the nature
of our inquiry, Mr. Rykert.

16:52.749 --> 16:55.083
Did you know this girl?

16:55.085 --> 16:57.586
No, I don't think so.

16:57.588 --> 16:59.855
You probably know her as Kate.

17:01.991 --> 17:05.060
She looks vaguely familiar
but not really ringing a bell.

17:05.061 --> 17:06.828
Well, how 'bout I ring your bell
for you?

17:06.829 --> 17:10.699
These are e-mails you sent
to her via her escort service.

17:10.701 --> 17:13.034
"Trust me, you blanking blank,

17:13.036 --> 17:15.904
"you and that little blank will
live to regret this decision.

17:15.906 --> 17:18.339
Mark my blanking words."

17:19.208 --> 17:21.076
Okay. I knew her.

17:21.078 --> 17:22.611
So what?
- So she's dead.

17:22.613 --> 17:24.713
A decision I'm
sure she regrets.

17:24.714 --> 17:26.214
Mark my blanking words.

17:26.215 --> 17:28.116
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

17:28.117 --> 17:31.319
I had nothing-- I repeat,
nothing-- to do with her death.

17:31.321 --> 17:33.622
Where were you Monday night
at 8:00, Mr. Rykert?

17:34.523 --> 17:36.091
I'm not saying anything.

17:36.093 --> 17:38.093
I need to speak
with my attorney.

17:49.438 --> 17:51.106
Maybe this'll help.

17:51.108 --> 17:52.274
I don't need help.

17:52.276 --> 17:53.508
Yes, you do.

17:53.510 --> 17:55.343
You did a
shameful thing.

17:55.345 --> 17:57.045
No, I did not.

17:57.047 --> 17:58.813
Yes, you did.

17:58.815 --> 18:00.115
And you know it.

18:00.117 --> 18:02.684
And no amount of
Doris Kearns Goodwin

18:02.686 --> 18:05.153
on how our great leaders
made the sausages

18:05.155 --> 18:06.388
is gonna distract you.

18:06.390 --> 18:08.319
Will you leave me alone
so I can at least try?

18:08.343 --> 18:09.558
No.

18:09.559 --> 18:11.927
What the hell else
am I supposed to do, Pop?

18:11.929 --> 18:14.095
Put yourself in
Father Phil's shoes.

18:14.097 --> 18:18.166
I am. And I still come out
in favor of state over church,

18:18.168 --> 18:21.469
a kid's welfare
over some ancient edict.

18:21.471 --> 18:24.072
And he's earned his right
to protect the seal.

18:24.074 --> 18:25.340
How?

18:25.342 --> 18:27.342
You confess your sins,

18:27.344 --> 18:28.710
you say your three Hail Marys,

18:28.712 --> 18:31.780
you drop some change
in the poor box on the way out.

18:31.782 --> 18:32.747
As I was taught to do.

18:32.749 --> 18:34.549
Yes. But
the priest,

18:34.551 --> 18:36.184
he's left with your sins.

18:36.186 --> 18:38.019
He absorbs your sins.

18:38.021 --> 18:40.522
He prays for you.

18:40.524 --> 18:42.424
As he took a vow to do.

18:42.426 --> 18:43.825
Yes.

18:43.827 --> 18:46.027
And he has nothing
but smiles and good cheer

18:46.029 --> 18:49.297
for the cheating husband
and his innocent family

18:49.299 --> 18:51.666
when he sees them at church
after mass on Sunday.

18:53.469 --> 18:57.138
This costs a priest.

18:57.140 --> 18:59.641
Times all the sinners,

18:59.643 --> 19:01.977
times all the years.

19:05.449 --> 19:09.351
He is on the job,
in his own way.

19:11.187 --> 19:13.989
I ever tell you
Father Phil took the NYPD exam

19:13.991 --> 19:16.358
before he went in the seminary?

19:16.360 --> 19:19.194
Well, doesn't surprise me,

19:19.196 --> 19:22.163
if truth be told.

19:25.002 --> 19:29.037
I don't know what the shrinks
would call it.

19:29.039 --> 19:33.575
You're drawn
to a life of sacrifice.

19:37.913 --> 19:42.050
If you ever find out,
I don't want to know.

20:05.642 --> 20:07.509
Hey, man.
- Hey.

20:07.511 --> 20:08.910
Why aren't you
out there with her?

20:08.912 --> 20:09.911
Medical condition.

20:09.913 --> 20:11.546
Doc says I got two left feet.

20:11.548 --> 20:15.216
You sure you two
are just partners?

20:15.218 --> 20:17.185
Pretty sure. Yeah.

20:17.187 --> 20:18.686
And for what it's worth,

20:18.688 --> 20:21.256
me and Jen used to be
"just friends."

20:35.205 --> 20:38.907
Looks like your boy
just got lost.

20:38.909 --> 20:41.910
Hey, take it easy. Remember,
she's just your partner.

20:41.912 --> 20:43.678
Yeah. So I'm just
looking out for her.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.014
He's just dancing.

20:46.016 --> 20:48.383
Hey. I got this,
all right? I'm cool.

20:55.392 --> 20:58.893
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, we just got a call.

20:58.895 --> 21:02.330
There's a cat up in a tree.
They need you guys urgently.

21:02.332 --> 21:03.998
I let the last one slide, man.
Not this one.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.868
What are you gonna do,
write me a parking ticket?

21:06.870 --> 21:09.170
I got this. I can talk
to this guy, all right?

21:45.109 --> 21:47.276
Okay, Counselor,
you said you want to talk.

21:47.278 --> 21:48.511
Well, start talking.

21:48.513 --> 21:50.646
Want to be very clear
here at the outset

21:50.648 --> 21:53.215
that my client had absolutely
nothing to do with the death

21:53.217 --> 21:56.952
of Lindsey Wentworth,
who he knew to be "Kate."

21:56.954 --> 21:58.220
Okay. But?

21:58.222 --> 22:00.022
It's a delicate matter,
Detective.

22:00.024 --> 22:01.257
Actually, it's a

22:01.259 --> 22:04.860
cold-blooded murder, and your
client is suspect numero uno.

22:04.862 --> 22:09.431
I have information that will
fully exonerate Mr. Rykert.

22:09.433 --> 22:10.799
That's great.
Can't wait to hear it.

22:10.801 --> 22:12.535
First, I need
assurances from you

22:12.537 --> 22:14.336
that you'll agree to our terms.

22:14.338 --> 22:16.772
Think maybe you better take
another look at your hand.

22:16.774 --> 22:18.607
'Cause you're not
holding any cards here.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.809
Detective, please,
all we're asking for

22:20.811 --> 22:22.978
is a little discretion,
some courtesy.

22:22.980 --> 22:24.747
Discretion?

22:24.749 --> 22:26.448
You do realize
that with these e-mails,

22:26.450 --> 22:28.317
there's already enough
to call a grand jury.

22:28.319 --> 22:30.653
Now, that may not be enough
to ensure an indictment,

22:30.655 --> 22:32.755
but it is enough
to ensure a perp walk

22:32.757 --> 22:34.557
right past the cameras
for your client.

22:34.559 --> 22:36.859
- Is that discreet enough for you?
- Detectives,

22:36.861 --> 22:39.962
Mr. Rykert is
a happily-married man

22:39.964 --> 22:41.230
of over 15 years.

22:41.232 --> 22:44.300
So happy he spent
over 50 grand on hookers?

22:44.302 --> 22:45.801
I'm sure his wife would love

22:45.803 --> 22:47.436
to learn
about that.

22:47.438 --> 22:50.306
That's exactly the kind of
situation I'm trying to avoid.

22:50.308 --> 22:52.875
Seems like you're trying
to avoid a lot more than that.

22:52.877 --> 22:55.544
Now I know you lawyers get paid
by the hour, which is great,

22:55.546 --> 22:58.047
'cause you can pad your bills
all you want, but we don't.

22:58.049 --> 22:59.782
So if you got an alibi for us,

22:59.784 --> 23:02.117
why don't you tell us
what the hell it is, okay?

23:03.920 --> 23:08.290
He was having dinner with his
wife at the time of the murder.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.893
<i>And you want us
to take your word for it</i>

23:10.895 --> 23:12.928
so we don't have to speak
to the missus...

23:12.930 --> 23:15.898
For fear she will learn
the nature of our inquiry.

23:15.900 --> 23:17.766
It would be greatly appreciated.

23:17.768 --> 23:21.303
It would also be
greatly unprofessional, so, no.

23:21.305 --> 23:22.771
- And a lot less fun.
- Yeah.

23:22.773 --> 23:23.335
Detectives...

23:23.359 --> 23:25.208
If your client
didn't want

23:25.209 --> 23:26.909
his wife to know he was a creep,

23:26.911 --> 23:28.944
then he shouldn't have been
such a creep.

23:29.846 --> 23:31.614
Can't really argue with that.

23:37.020 --> 23:39.788
And Danny's oldest is starting
to look at colleges.

23:39.790 --> 23:41.924
Is Fordham
on that list?

23:41.926 --> 23:43.225
I hope so.

23:43.227 --> 23:44.560
Notre Dame?

23:44.562 --> 23:46.328
I have some
pull there, too.

23:46.330 --> 23:48.063
Well, I appreciate that.

23:48.065 --> 23:50.899
Which brings us
to the matter at hand.

23:50.901 --> 23:52.201
Which is?

23:52.203 --> 23:54.069
We have a situation.

23:54.071 --> 23:55.304
We?

23:55.306 --> 23:57.873
<i>I have a situation,</i>

23:57.875 --> 23:59.408
and it's time sensitive.

23:59.410 --> 24:00.809
Well, I'm all ears.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.848
You have,
surveillance cameras

24:05.850 --> 24:08.317
at St. Mary's
in the Bronx.

24:08.319 --> 24:10.552
I'm not sure,
but I'll inquire.

24:10.554 --> 24:12.488
It's a statement,
not a question.

24:12.490 --> 24:14.823
Well, then
I'll take your word for it.

24:14.825 --> 24:16.091
What's going on?

24:16.093 --> 24:18.827
I need copies of the tapes.

24:18.829 --> 24:22.231
You're not seriously
asking that of me, are you?

24:22.233 --> 24:22.795
I am.

24:22.819 --> 24:24.819
It's a statement,
not a question.

24:24.869 --> 24:28.737
And the answer is,
respectfully, no.

24:28.739 --> 24:31.407
I'm afraid I'll have to insist.

24:31.409 --> 24:33.308
Insist?
- Yes.

24:33.310 --> 24:35.210
Police business.

24:35.212 --> 24:36.879
What kind of business?

24:36.881 --> 24:39.715
A credible threat.

24:39.717 --> 24:41.150
Against who?

24:41.152 --> 24:43.452
I'm not at liberty to say.

24:43.454 --> 24:45.854
You're not at liberty to say?

24:45.856 --> 24:47.890
If this were a mosque
or a temple,

24:47.892 --> 24:49.758
would you be questioning
my intent?

24:49.760 --> 24:52.194
But it's not.
It's a Roman Catholic church.

24:52.196 --> 24:55.030
It's not the Vatican,
not its own city-state.

24:55.032 --> 24:57.466
Just a parish church
that might be a place

24:57.468 --> 24:59.435
of interest
in a credible threat.

24:59.437 --> 25:01.804
You say "credible threat"
like it's a magical phrase

25:01.806 --> 25:03.605
that opens all doors.

25:03.607 --> 25:05.741
I can get a subpoena.

25:05.743 --> 25:08.143
Now, come on, Frank.
For security tapes,

25:08.145 --> 25:10.846
surveillance footage
of the comings and goings

25:10.848 --> 25:13.315
at an archdiocese church.

25:15.118 --> 25:17.586
What's everyone's next question?

25:17.588 --> 25:20.589
Who's the priest?
Who's the victim?

25:22.459 --> 25:25.327
The times we live in.

25:26.996 --> 25:28.964
Just between us.

25:28.966 --> 25:31.133
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

25:32.469 --> 25:34.503
My detectives will be there
in ten minutes.

25:34.505 --> 25:37.072
You might want to call over.

25:41.712 --> 25:44.313
Think you might have enjoyed
that a little bit too much.

25:44.315 --> 25:47.182
Did you see that creep groveling
for forgiveness from his wife?

25:47.184 --> 25:48.650
What's not to
enjoy about that?

25:48.652 --> 25:51.153
Look, I enjoyed it, too,
but his alibi checked out,

25:51.155 --> 25:52.988
and now we don't have
any suspects left.

25:52.990 --> 25:54.423
Well, let's go
back to the area

25:54.425 --> 25:56.125
and see if there were
any surveillance cameras.

25:56.127 --> 25:57.426
Maybe we missed something.

25:57.428 --> 25:58.660
We've been there
three times.

25:58.662 --> 26:00.362
We didn't miss anything,
trust me.

26:00.364 --> 26:02.598
Where's Big Brother
when you need him?

26:03.933 --> 26:07.636
Well, I'm starting to think
only God knows how Lindsey died.

26:07.638 --> 26:09.938
Maybe we should talk to him.

26:12.776 --> 26:15.077
What is it?

26:15.079 --> 26:18.547
There may actually be
an eye in the sky.

26:18.549 --> 26:20.682
An eye in the sky?

26:20.684 --> 26:22.785
I got a buddy who works with the
feds. Apparently, there's some

26:22.787 --> 26:25.988
Department of Agriculture
classified satellite up there

26:25.990 --> 26:28.924
in the sky that takes pictures
of the soil in the city

26:28.926 --> 26:30.492
to check on erosion and stuff.

26:30.494 --> 26:32.060
Soil erosion?
I think you've gone

26:32.062 --> 26:33.629
a little bit off track, partner.

26:33.631 --> 26:35.998
<i>What does it matter why
there's a camera up in the sky</i>

26:36.000 --> 26:37.266
taking pictures round the clock,

26:37.268 --> 26:39.334
<i>as long as there is a camera
up in the sky</i>

26:39.336 --> 26:40.869
taking pictures
around the clock?

26:40.871 --> 26:43.605
So you're thinking they got
Lindsey's murder on film?

26:43.607 --> 26:47.509
It's worth taking a shot
to find out.

27:01.057 --> 27:03.258
<i>How'd you sleep?</i>

27:04.394 --> 27:06.962
Like a baby.

27:06.964 --> 27:10.199
A baby with a black eye
in a county lock-up.

27:10.201 --> 27:12.267
How long
you been out here?

27:12.269 --> 27:14.536
About five minutes.

27:14.538 --> 27:16.538
Thanks for having my back
last night.

27:16.540 --> 27:18.407
Yeah, thanks for
starting it.

27:18.409 --> 27:19.975
I didn't start it.

27:19.977 --> 27:22.110
You kind of did.
More than kind of.

27:22.112 --> 27:24.246
He started it
with the NYPD cracks.

27:24.248 --> 27:26.615
So now you got thin skin
about the police department?

27:26.617 --> 27:28.016
It was insulting.

27:28.018 --> 27:29.518
I've been on the
street with you

27:29.520 --> 27:32.054
when people have said way worse
to you about your own father,

27:32.056 --> 27:33.956
and you just laugh it off.

27:33.958 --> 27:35.958
What are you saying, Eddie?
Just spit it out.

27:35.960 --> 27:39.094
You got pissed 'cause
that guy had his eye on me.

27:39.096 --> 27:40.329
This is about you?

27:40.331 --> 27:41.563
No. This is about you

27:41.565 --> 27:44.967
sending signals about us,
but never copping to it.

27:44.969 --> 27:46.368
No pun intended.

27:46.370 --> 27:49.104
What signals? That guy got
in my grill, plain and simple.

27:49.106 --> 27:51.306
It's smart not to want
what you can't have,

27:51.308 --> 27:53.475
but first, you have to admit
that you don't want it,

27:53.477 --> 27:55.143
just so everybody's clear.

27:55.145 --> 27:56.545
I'm confused.

27:56.547 --> 27:58.380
Aren't we all?

28:12.896 --> 28:14.830
Great.
- You got it.

28:14.832 --> 28:18.200
So sit in the second
to the last booth in the back

28:18.202 --> 28:20.369
and await instructions.
We're heading back.

28:20.371 --> 28:22.905
Why do I feel like I'm
in a James Bond movie?

28:22.907 --> 28:24.907
Guy says he's with
the feds, which means

28:24.909 --> 28:27.175
he can't have whatever he's
giving us traced back to him.

28:27.177 --> 28:29.845
So now what?
We just sit here?

28:29.847 --> 28:33.215
Yeah, we sit and await
instructions, like it says.

28:34.818 --> 28:37.085
Is that him?

28:37.087 --> 28:38.687
I don't know the number.

28:38.689 --> 28:40.622
Maybe it's Jason Bourne.

28:41.491 --> 28:44.059
Reagan.

28:44.061 --> 28:46.495
Okay.

28:46.497 --> 28:48.130
That was fast.

28:48.132 --> 28:50.065
He said order lunch.

28:50.067 --> 28:51.600
Are you sure

28:51.602 --> 28:53.869
your friend isn't just having
some fun pulling your leg?

28:53.871 --> 28:55.570
Order lunch.

29:10.119 --> 29:14.389
Appears Big Brother
was watching.

29:14.391 --> 29:15.891
And look what he saw.

29:18.094 --> 29:20.562
Took a taxi.
We can blow that up,

29:20.564 --> 29:22.531
get his medallion number.

29:22.533 --> 29:26.368
Already done.

29:26.370 --> 29:28.337
Impressive.
- Reagan.

29:28.339 --> 29:31.940
Daniel... Reagan.

29:35.345 --> 29:37.012
Is aviation in place?

29:37.014 --> 29:38.780
Yes, and ESU is
on the scene.

29:38.782 --> 29:40.649
As soon as they can
secure the rear,

29:40.651 --> 29:41.917
they're gonna
hit the front.

29:41.919 --> 29:43.785
It's a go
as soon as they're in place.

29:43.787 --> 29:47.589
Excuse me, Commissioner.

29:47.591 --> 29:49.191
Father Phillip just showed up.

29:51.361 --> 29:53.729
In my office.

30:10.880 --> 30:12.681
Father.

30:12.683 --> 30:14.916
Sit down.

30:18.521 --> 30:22.424
Why are you here?

30:24.027 --> 30:26.028
I came to a decision.

30:26.030 --> 30:28.363
I want to...
- Stop!

30:29.465 --> 30:31.933
Please.

30:37.306 --> 30:39.374
I've taken two oaths--

30:39.376 --> 30:42.911
to my faith and to my job.

30:42.913 --> 30:44.946
I had no right to ask you

30:44.948 --> 30:48.083
to make a choice
I hadn't made myself.

30:48.085 --> 30:50.285
What do you mean?

30:50.287 --> 30:54.956
We have a name--
Mitchell Downey.

30:57.794 --> 31:00.595
The boy is there.

31:01.431 --> 31:05.033
But... how?

31:06.869 --> 31:10.372
He helps those
who help themselves.

31:25.644 --> 31:27.511
This our guy?

31:27.513 --> 31:29.513
Yup. Medallion number 36Z1.

31:29.515 --> 31:30.847
Beautiful.

31:30.849 --> 31:32.382
Pablo Salazar?

31:32.384 --> 31:33.817
...no.

31:33.819 --> 31:36.320
...yeah.

31:36.322 --> 31:38.522
- Who are you?
- Police.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.724
We're gonna have a little chat.

31:44.662 --> 31:47.364
I didn't do anything. I swear.

31:47.366 --> 31:48.465
Come on. We spoke to your boss.

31:48.467 --> 31:50.000
We know it was you
driving that taxi.

31:50.002 --> 31:51.301
That's your cab
right there.

31:51.303 --> 31:53.737
You trying to tell us
that's not you?

31:53.739 --> 31:57.307
Yeah, it's me, but...
I didn't hurt that girl.

31:57.309 --> 31:59.109
Then what are you doing

31:59.111 --> 32:00.844
outside of the cab,
standing over her

32:00.846 --> 32:02.579
in the park?

32:02.581 --> 32:05.983
I was... taking her wallet.

32:05.985 --> 32:07.884
Taking her wallet? Why?

32:07.886 --> 32:09.253
You just randomly happened

32:09.255 --> 32:10.520
upon this dead
woman in the park,

32:10.522 --> 32:12.189
and decided you were
gonna steal her wallet?

32:12.191 --> 32:14.391
I didn't steal it!
He told me to go back for it!

32:14.393 --> 32:15.959
Who's he?
- My passenger.

32:15.961 --> 32:17.160
Who's your passenger?!

32:17.162 --> 32:18.495
I don't know his name.

32:18.497 --> 32:21.632
He got in my cab, and he gave me
$1,000 to follow that girl.

32:21.634 --> 32:23.400
How long did you follow her for?

32:23.402 --> 32:26.737
Not long. We started
when she came out of the hotel.

32:26.739 --> 32:29.006
Then she was crossing
through the park on foot,

32:29.008 --> 32:30.474
and that's when
he told me to stop.

32:30.476 --> 32:31.908
When he told you to stop?

32:31.910 --> 32:33.277
Where? Right here?

32:35.446 --> 32:37.714
He was very upset.

32:37.716 --> 32:40.450
He got out of my cab
screaming and yelling.

32:40.452 --> 32:42.386
Then he hit her.

32:42.388 --> 32:45.722
I didn't know what to do,
so I started to call 911.

32:45.724 --> 32:46.690
That's interesting.

32:46.692 --> 32:48.258
Because we checked
the 911 records,

32:48.260 --> 32:49.693
and guess what?

32:49.695 --> 32:52.596
Nobody called 911
about a woman being

32:52.598 --> 32:54.197
assaulted in a park.
Because before

32:54.199 --> 32:55.966
I could make the call,
he was already back in my cab.

32:55.968 --> 32:57.100
And the woman?

32:57.102 --> 32:59.770
She's dead.

32:59.772 --> 33:01.271
Just like that.

33:01.273 --> 33:02.706
It happened so fast.

33:02.708 --> 33:04.474
You still could've called 911.

33:04.476 --> 33:06.643
But you didn't.
Instead you took a wallet

33:06.645 --> 33:08.945
out of dead woman's pocket. Why?

33:08.947 --> 33:10.881
He told me to. I...

33:10.883 --> 33:12.449
He said he couldn't go back.

33:12.451 --> 33:13.984
He couldn't look at her.

33:13.986 --> 33:15.185
Okay, let me get this straight.

33:15.187 --> 33:17.387
Some strange person
gets in your taxi,

33:17.389 --> 33:20.023
tells you to follow a woman,
makes you park illegally,

33:20.025 --> 33:21.925
gets out, kills her,
then sends you

33:21.927 --> 33:23.894
to take her wallet
from her dead body?

33:23.896 --> 33:27.331
And you do it
just because he said so?!

33:27.333 --> 33:28.999
Did he have a gun
to your head or something?

33:29.001 --> 33:30.367
No.

33:30.369 --> 33:33.437
Then why?

33:34.272 --> 33:36.173
$30,000. That's why.

33:36.175 --> 33:38.075
A drop in the bucket
for you.

33:38.077 --> 33:39.676
But life-altering for Pablo.

33:39.678 --> 33:41.411
I don't know who that man is.

33:41.413 --> 33:42.946
I don't know
what he's talking about.

33:42.948 --> 33:45.148
- I've never seen him before.
- Yes, you have.

33:45.150 --> 33:46.983
You were the
passenger in his taxi.

33:46.985 --> 33:48.552
That is absolutely not true.

33:48.554 --> 33:51.221
I would like to speak
with my lawyer right now!

33:51.223 --> 33:54.024
Why don't you watch this first?

33:56.694 --> 33:58.795
Did you know they equip

33:58.797 --> 34:00.564
all taxis with these
cameras nowadays?

34:00.566 --> 34:01.832
Pretty cool?

34:01.834 --> 34:04.034
Amazing.

34:05.703 --> 34:07.771
On your feet.

34:07.773 --> 34:11.842
Come on, get
on your feet.

34:11.844 --> 34:14.610
You're under arrest for
the murder of your wife.

34:14.612 --> 34:17.013
You can call your lawyer later.

34:21.152 --> 34:23.954
Under false pretenses!

34:23.956 --> 34:25.789
Nothing false about 'em.
- The term

34:25.791 --> 34:27.791
"credible threat" is a term...
- There was

34:27.793 --> 34:29.592
a very credible threat.
...always used

34:29.594 --> 34:31.261
in conjunction with terrorism!

34:31.263 --> 34:32.728
There was no such threat here!

34:32.731 --> 34:34.297
And I'll thank you
to let me decide

34:34.299 --> 34:36.766
what is a credible
threat in my city!

34:36.768 --> 34:38.534
You played the Church, Frank.

34:38.536 --> 34:39.870
You played the archbishop.

34:39.871 --> 34:42.606
You're referring to yourself
in the third person now.

34:42.608 --> 34:43.774
You are pissed.

34:43.775 --> 34:45.675
The pastor up there,
Father Philip-- you know him.

34:45.677 --> 34:48.078
- Yes.
- He visited you in your office.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.347
- You visited him at St. Mary's.
- Yes.

34:50.349 --> 34:52.482
During a time when a young
parishioner went missing.

34:52.484 --> 34:53.949
And that parishioner
has been found.

34:53.952 --> 34:55.518
Yeah, with great help from
those tapes, I would imagine.

34:55.521 --> 34:57.687
Which brings me here with
this bottle of Scotch

34:57.689 --> 34:59.055
and my sincere thanks.

34:59.057 --> 35:01.291
You used those tapes to learn
the identity of a penitent!

35:01.293 --> 35:02.626
I used

35:02.628 --> 35:05.729
those tapes to identify any
possible person of interest.

35:05.731 --> 35:09.132
I would have no way of knowing
if that person made confession

35:09.134 --> 35:11.067
at St. Mary's.
- No way of knowing.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.136
No heads-up from the pastor?

35:13.138 --> 35:14.204
That heads-up would mean

35:14.206 --> 35:16.039
breaking the seal
of the sacrament,

35:16.041 --> 35:17.407
for him and for me.

35:17.409 --> 35:19.543
I am a lifelong Catholic,
I would remind you.

35:19.545 --> 35:23.113
And I would remind you
that lying is a sin.

35:23.115 --> 35:25.482
Look, I am old school.

35:25.484 --> 35:27.584
I take the wine
with my communion host,

35:27.586 --> 35:28.785
I miss the Latin Mass,

35:28.787 --> 35:31.455
by the way, and
I only do my

35:31.457 --> 35:33.657
reconciliations
kneeling in the confessional.

35:33.659 --> 35:36.660
All right, have it your way,
Frank, but let me be clear.

35:36.662 --> 35:37.894
If I find out

35:37.896 --> 35:40.330
that Father Phillip
violated his oath in any way,

35:40.332 --> 35:43.099
he will be stripped of
his collar and excommunicated.

35:43.101 --> 35:45.802
That would be
the Church's great mistake.

35:45.804 --> 35:47.504
He is a priest you need

35:47.506 --> 35:49.773
at a time
when they are in short supply.

35:49.775 --> 35:52.342
Not if he turned
against his vows.

35:52.344 --> 35:54.611
He kept his oath.

35:54.613 --> 35:57.581
You have my word, Kevin.

35:57.583 --> 36:00.116
Your word?

36:00.118 --> 36:03.286
Yeah, it's been pretty good in
this town for a long time now.

36:03.288 --> 36:04.821
You could ask around.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.360
Good day, Your Eminence.

36:54.205 --> 36:56.106
So, how was the food in prison?

36:56.108 --> 36:59.743
It wasn't prison, Pop.
It was county lock-up.

36:59.745 --> 37:01.945
So they didn't have food?

37:01.947 --> 37:03.680
They had it.
I just didn't eat it.

37:03.682 --> 37:06.316
Wow. One night in jail, and
you had a hunger strike?

37:06.318 --> 37:08.051
It wasn't a hunger
strike, Danny.

37:08.053 --> 37:10.120
You're the jailhouse-lawyer now, too?

37:10.122 --> 37:11.388
Ha, ha.

37:11.390 --> 37:12.822
I have to say
I'm happy and relieved

37:12.824 --> 37:14.391
that you spent the night
in the clink.

37:14.393 --> 37:16.526
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

37:16.528 --> 37:17.661
Why are you relieved?

37:17.663 --> 37:18.895
Well, 'cause I'm no longer

37:18.897 --> 37:21.498
the only person at this table
to have served time.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.266
One night in holding
is not time.

37:23.268 --> 37:25.502
One night is, too, time.

37:25.504 --> 37:28.038
Well, you weren't the only
one, anyway. I did, too.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.339
You did?

37:29.341 --> 37:30.774
Yes. Once upon a time,

37:30.776 --> 37:33.143
<i>there was a documentary called
Scared Straight.</i>

37:33.145 --> 37:36.079
And not the watered-down
TV version you see now.

37:36.081 --> 37:37.180
In the old days,

37:37.182 --> 37:39.049
the inmates could actually
rough the kids up.

37:39.051 --> 37:41.318
And your grandfather thought
it was the greatest thing

37:41.320 --> 37:42.786
since sliced bread.
I did not.

37:42.788 --> 37:44.321
Yes, you did.

37:44.323 --> 37:47.190
And at the tender age of 12,
I skipped school once,

37:47.192 --> 37:49.359
and he decided
I should get sent upstate

37:49.361 --> 37:52.028
with all those crazy inmates and
get the crap scared out of me.

37:52.030 --> 37:54.397
Three hours. That's not spending
the night in jail. Sorry.

37:54.399 --> 37:55.765
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:55.767 --> 37:56.933
So you sent

37:56.935 --> 37:58.802
your own kid to jail
for skipping school?

37:58.804 --> 38:00.337
He was big on tough love.

38:00.339 --> 38:02.439
I was heading off
bigger trouble.

38:02.441 --> 38:04.107
And I was all for it.

38:04.109 --> 38:07.177
I'm really missing my own
mom and dad right about now.

38:07.179 --> 38:09.412
What about you, Grandpa?
You ever been to jail?

38:09.414 --> 38:10.647
No, of course not.

38:10.649 --> 38:11.715
Francis.

38:11.717 --> 38:13.283
What?

38:13.285 --> 38:16.920
Shore Patrol is not the police,
and the brig is not jail.

38:16.922 --> 38:20.290
And breaking up a bar and
brawling with sailors was what?

38:20.292 --> 38:21.691
Semper Fi.

38:21.693 --> 38:22.759
What's that?

38:22.761 --> 38:24.961
Motto of the Marines
and an excuse for him,

38:24.963 --> 38:26.463
apparently.

38:26.465 --> 38:28.565
Pops, what about you?
- Helped

38:28.567 --> 38:32.369
some pals picketing to unionize
their shop outside Pittsburgh.

38:32.371 --> 38:34.904
We did a weekend, proudly.

38:34.906 --> 38:36.373
That counts.

38:36.375 --> 38:37.874
Wait. So you're the only

38:37.876 --> 38:40.210
Reagan who's never
spent time behind bars?

38:40.212 --> 38:42.312
That's right, and it's gonna
stay that way.

38:45.183 --> 38:46.783
What?

38:46.785 --> 38:48.451
Food's caught
in my throat.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.886
Grandpa, what?

38:49.888 --> 38:51.855
Asbury Park.

38:51.857 --> 38:52.822
Whoa. Wait. What?

38:52.824 --> 38:54.524
Asbury Park.

38:54.526 --> 38:55.759
You knew about that?

38:55.761 --> 38:57.494
Well, your mom
and her crew...

38:57.496 --> 38:59.396
I didn't have a crew.
...did just about everything

38:59.398 --> 39:02.799
you are not allowed to do
on a public beach at night.

39:02.801 --> 39:06.803
Loud music, bonfire,
drinking, public urination,

39:06.805 --> 39:09.506
skinny-dipping...
no law left unbroken.

39:09.508 --> 39:11.408
- Aah.
- I had them call Danny.

39:11.410 --> 39:13.443
I didn't say anything
to anyone, I swear.

39:13.445 --> 39:15.345
Well, he tried to get her off,

39:15.347 --> 39:16.980
but he didn't
have the pull,

39:16.982 --> 39:19.249
but the CO knew me,
so he gives me a ring

39:19.251 --> 39:20.817
and offers to do me a solid.

39:20.819 --> 39:22.318
And you passed?

39:22.320 --> 39:25.088
As history tells us, yes.

39:25.090 --> 39:26.523
Dad, that place was disgusting!

39:26.525 --> 39:28.591
I still have nightmares!

39:28.593 --> 39:32.395
And look how wonderful
you all turned out.

40:10.202 --> 40:13.269
Sorry I'm late.

40:13.271 --> 40:16.740
I'm glad you made it.

40:16.742 --> 40:19.943
But this place?

40:19.945 --> 40:22.011
What?

40:22.013 --> 40:24.114
Jamie, people
are dancing here.

40:24.116 --> 40:26.483
You don't like dancing.

40:26.485 --> 40:30.620
Right place,
right time, I do. Come on.

40:32.523 --> 40:34.124
Can I get a drink first?

40:34.126 --> 40:37.861
You already had a couple, trying
to decide whether to show up.

40:40.932 --> 40:44.134
Somebody's gonna
make detective.

40:51.842 --> 40:55.812
I am positive we are the
only cops in this joint.

40:55.814 --> 40:58.648
And the only couple
with matching black eyes.

41:00.918 --> 41:03.052
Do you ever think about

41:03.054 --> 41:05.622
what we might be
missing out on?

41:05.624 --> 41:08.124
Yup.

41:10.294 --> 41:13.363
You ever think about what
we might be giving up?

41:24.943 --> 41:26.509
Jamie?

41:26.511 --> 41:29.012
Yeah?

41:29.014 --> 41:32.615
You dance just fine.
