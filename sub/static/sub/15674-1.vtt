01:48.176 --> 01:50.211
I have a few more questions

01:50.278 --> 01:52.513
about what happened here
last night.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.382
We already went through
everything

01:54.448 --> 01:56.584
with the other detectives.

- What are we gonna do?

Well, I'd be happy to give you
a ride to the station

02:26.914 --> 02:28.849
when we're done here.

02:28.916 --> 02:31.385
How did you know Freedgood?

02:31.452 --> 02:34.222
We all went to college
together, back east.

02:34.288 --> 02:37.225
He was my big brother
in our fraternity.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.294
We played on the football team
together.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.895

this weekend?

02:41.962 --> 02:43.664
Yes, sir.

05:39.573 --> 05:41.742
So you are not
the owners of this house?

05:41.809 --> 05:46.146
We were just housesitting
for the summer.

05:46.213 --> 05:47.515
Until today.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.951
Hmm. Labor Day.

05:51.018 --> 05:54.087
I'm gonna have a look around.
You two stay put.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.756
The police already took
a really good look last night.

05:55.823 --> 05:58.258
- I insist.
- That's not really necessary.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.927
Yes, it is.

Both of you,
just sit tight for a sec.

get in a car with him.

you saw Freedgood?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.458

07:04.525 --> 07:06.460
Back, uh, back when
we were in college,

07:06.527 --> 07:08.095
before he went to jail.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.563
What about Veronica?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.364
It's a different story.

07:11.431 --> 07:16.804
Veronica and Freedgood were
together when we all met, but...

07:16.870 --> 07:19.540
we've been together
for over three years now.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.841

this weekend

07:22.510 --> 07:24.712

of getting her back?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.448
You know, I got out of East LA,
thanks to football.

18:01.514 --> 18:04.984
I mean, it got me into a
great college on the east coast

18:05.051 --> 18:07.254
with the likes of you and her.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.956
And when I got there,
I was like everyone else.

18:10.022 --> 18:14.794
I thought that I had arrived,
and the world owes me a living.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.129
Yeah, yeah.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.797
- You know?
- Yeah.

18:17.864 --> 18:21.801
And then when I got
thrown out on my ass,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.303
I had no family support.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.605
I had no father to be found.

18:25.672 --> 18:28.875
My mother was a fucking
basket case, bro.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.344
No degree, no opportunity.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.880
Busted right back down
to private.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.682
[scoffs]

18:35.748 --> 18:37.284
But you know what?

18:37.350 --> 18:40.487
It was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.756
Hey, man, I wanna thank you

18:43.823 --> 18:46.526
for everything
that you've done for me.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.428
You know it means
the world to me.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.997
You would've done
the same thing for me.

18:51.063 --> 18:53.233
Of course I would've.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.636
You could've
paid me a visit though.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.671
Yeah.

18:58.738 --> 19:02.309
Who wants to see Freedgood
stuck in a cage though?

19:02.375 --> 19:04.711
I've been out for three years.

19:06.513 --> 19:08.548
[exhales]
What are you doing here, man?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.750
You know what I'm doing, Percy.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.285
You want a chemist?

19:12.352 --> 19:14.221
One that can't say no
to an old friend.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.489
- I'm not doing that.
- Yes, you will.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.057
- I will not.
- Yes, you are.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.793
'Cause it worked out so well
for everybody last time?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.730
Worked out pretty well
for you, as I recall.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.607
This street here,

19:34.674 --> 19:37.210
is it the only street that
leads directly to the house?

19:37.277 --> 19:39.779
- I can't do it.
- You have to do it.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.215
- I'll do anything else.
- There is nothing else.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.484
- Anything else.
- Two years of my life, Percy.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.453
You know why history
repeats itself?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.887
Do you know why this happens
time and again?

19:47.954 --> 19:50.022
'Cause no one was listening
the first time.

19:50.089 --> 19:51.724
I could've said your name,
and I didn't.

19:51.791 --> 19:55.795
And I'm grateful for that.
[sighs]

19:55.862 --> 19:56.929
You're in arrears.

19:56.996 --> 19:58.398
- I'm not gonna do it.
- Yes, you are.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.667
- I'm not doing it.
- Yes, you are.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.841
If I do this...

20:08.908 --> 20:10.843
If I do this,
we're all square, right?

20:10.910 --> 20:13.313
We're fucking square, circle,
rectangle, whatever shape.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.848
You, me and Veronica,
that's it, right?

20:15.915 --> 20:18.485
That's it.
You two are free and clear.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.790
- How much shit?
- A lot of shit.

20:23.856 --> 20:25.725
But you don't have
to worry about that.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.627
That's exactly what
I have to worry about.

20:27.694 --> 20:31.264
We won't tell Veronica
our little secret.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.904
VERONICA: So the drugs
are in the house?

20:37.970 --> 20:40.907
Yeah.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.742
I don't wanna do this.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.944
We all have to do things
we don't want to do.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.413
What are you doing?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.748
VERONICA: I'm doing
everything that I can.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.918
PERCY: What are you gonna do
if he finds out, huh?

20:51.984 --> 20:54.487
VERONICA: He's not gonna
find out, okay?

20:54.554 --> 20:56.823
Because I... I don't know.
I just know.

20:56.889 --> 20:58.825
PERCY: Listen, you don't what
he's like in this situation.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.460
You don't know
what he's capable of.

21:00.527 --> 21:02.295
What are you so afraid of?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.964
Wasting my life.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.500
Yeah, so am I.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.870
[thump]

21:17.777 --> 21:19.312
[door closes]

21:31.324 --> 21:33.192
Do you love me?

21:33.259 --> 21:35.027
- Yes.
- Really?

21:35.094 --> 21:36.796
- Yes.
- Yeah?

21:36.863 --> 21:40.600
Can you please stop talking
to me like I'm an employee?

21:43.269 --> 21:47.407
Percy, just do it.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.376
Do it for me.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.512
Okay.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.781
I'll do it.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.248
For you.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.351
Thank you.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.920
Don't thank me yet.

22:32.952 --> 22:38.558
[distant moaning]

22:55.007 --> 22:58.745
CORTEZ: What happened
in college, Percy?

22:58.811 --> 23:02.782
Upstate New York, there's
a place called Thompkins County.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.684
It's like Humboldt here.

23:04.751 --> 23:07.186
It's the best weed
on the east coast.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.321
I grew up there.
I was tied in.

23:09.388 --> 23:12.659
I'd been bartending my parents'
bar all summer, so I had cash.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.294
Freedgood had a car.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.530
Freedgood was good to me
back then.

23:17.597 --> 23:19.966
I was a little shy.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.669
He took me under his wing,
got me into the house.

23:22.735 --> 23:27.306
Anyway, we'd road trip down,
get the stuff,

23:27.373 --> 23:31.644
sell it back through
the fraternity house network.

23:31.711 --> 23:33.813
It seemed like
it was all going fine,

23:33.880 --> 23:38.918
but we didn't realize how big
the guy in Ithaca had become.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.821
So big,
the DA was watching him.

23:41.888 --> 23:44.323
We got followed
on our way back to Geneva.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.558
They pulled you over?

23:45.625 --> 23:48.995
No. I was driving.
I lost them.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.329
You drive fast.

23:50.396 --> 23:53.065
Yeah, but they traced the car
back to Freedgood.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.502
The next day,
they knocked down his door,

23:55.568 --> 23:58.070
hauled him in,
laid out what they had on him,

23:58.137 --> 24:00.372
told him that they were
after the guy up in Ithaca,

24:00.439 --> 24:02.942
wanted to know
how he was connected,

24:03.009 --> 24:05.612
who was driving back
from Ithaca, everything.

24:05.678 --> 24:06.946
Freedgood was hard.

24:07.013 --> 24:10.950
Never said anything.
Never mentioned my name.

24:11.017 --> 24:13.620
He went to prison
for two years,

24:13.686 --> 24:16.556
and you ended up
with Veronica.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.429
PERCY: Now you get it.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.632
He never forgave me.

24:25.698 --> 24:27.366
He went to prison.

24:27.433 --> 24:30.202
Veronica was never gonna
wait for him.

24:30.269 --> 24:33.940
And Freedgood,
he could never accept that.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.012
Your stroke is too rough.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.348
Stroke's fine.

24:42.414 --> 24:45.251
It needs to be smooth.

24:45.317 --> 24:48.154
See what I'm saying?
Almost broke the glass.

24:48.220 --> 24:51.023
Smooth, graceful.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.993
Water's your friend,
not your enemy.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.995
Works for me.

24:57.797 --> 25:01.267
- She still sleeps in, huh?
- Yeah.

25:01.333 --> 25:06.072
How was it jackin' it
in the guest bedroom?

25:06.138 --> 25:07.607
It was a'ight.

25:07.674 --> 25:11.110
Could've used
a little more motivation.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.178
You hungry?

25:12.244 --> 25:15.281
You look hungry.
I'll make us some food.

25:34.433 --> 25:38.838
[soft moaning]

26:48.941 --> 26:52.311
[screaming underwater]

26:54.313 --> 26:56.683
- [chuckles]
- What's your problem, man?

26:56.749 --> 26:58.918
Let's take a ride.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.793
[car passes by]

27:10.562 --> 27:13.065
What is it, seventy?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.701
Seventy-one.

27:14.767 --> 27:17.036
Totally rebuilt engine
from top to bottom.

27:17.103 --> 27:19.706
I really don't know
the whole car jargon,

27:19.772 --> 27:22.541
but the engine looks
fucking immaculate.

27:22.608 --> 27:26.245
Feels fucking immaculate.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.180
Pretty cool, huh?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.016
Fuckin' ideal.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.332
Did you have the talk
with her?

27:46.398 --> 27:48.334
What talk?

27:48.400 --> 27:49.869
You know, the marriage talk.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.871
Family, kids,
how to pay for all of it.

27:51.938 --> 27:55.141
Freedgood, I'm not even
25 years old yet.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.176
I understand that,
but if you're not careful,

27:57.243 --> 28:00.847
some Wall Street asshole
is gonna gobble her up.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.016
These aren't your problems.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.052
Yeah, 'cause you wanna
sit around

28:06.118 --> 28:09.055
and strum your six-string
all the doodah day.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.222
Yeah.

28:10.289 --> 28:11.724
'Cause you're
a unicorn motherfuck

28:11.791 --> 28:14.827
anyone who says you're not.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.700
You see this shoe?

28:21.768 --> 28:26.939
There's only ten stores in
the world that sell this shoe.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.141
What do you got on?

29:30.102 --> 29:32.038
PERCY: Where the hell are we?

29:32.104 --> 29:33.439
FREEDGOOD: This is where
my partners live.

29:33.505 --> 29:35.441
PERCY: Yeah?
Who are your partners?

29:35.507 --> 29:36.742
FREEDGOOD: These fuckin'
South Africans.

29:36.809 --> 29:38.911
They're into all kinda shit.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.718
If I come out screaming,
you know what to do.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.288
Why?

29:49.355 --> 29:52.524
Everything you have,
you have because of me, Percy.

30:22.621 --> 30:23.990
Fuck.

30:43.009 --> 30:47.546
There once was
a man named Percy.

30:49.448 --> 30:54.053
The cops,
they showed him no mercy.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.296
Shit.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.140
- Go, go, go. Let's go.
- What?

31:14.206 --> 31:15.707
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

31:15.774 --> 31:18.344
- Let's get the fuck outta here.
- [speaking Afrikaans]

31:18.410 --> 31:20.179
Shit. Come on.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.581
Percy, go!
Start the fucking car! Go!

31:22.648 --> 31:24.116
[bang on hood]

31:24.183 --> 31:26.185
Hey, watch
the fucking Stang, bro!

31:26.252 --> 31:29.555
I'll get out here
and whup your fuckin' ass!

31:29.621 --> 31:31.390
[speaking Afrikaans]

31:31.457 --> 31:35.227
Hey, get the fuck out of
the way, you piece of shit.

31:49.275 --> 31:51.610
You almost had
a fuckin' heart attack, bro.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.512
That was stupid.

31:53.579 --> 31:57.049
Do me a favor. Check your pulse.
[laughs]

31:57.116 --> 31:58.217
Relax, man.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.219
Don't tell me to relax.

32:00.286 --> 32:02.854
It was a joke, bro.
They're buddies of mine.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.658
What? It was a fuckin' joke?

32:06.725 --> 32:09.295
Pretty funny, huh?

32:09.361 --> 32:11.297
You know what's funny?
You know what's really funny?

32:11.363 --> 32:13.032
You wanna know
what's really, really fun?

32:13.099 --> 32:15.767
A cop car's been trailing us.
That's really funny.

32:15.834 --> 32:18.437
- Cop car?
- [siren blares]

32:18.504 --> 32:21.173
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

32:24.510 --> 32:27.313
Fuck, fuck.

32:27.379 --> 32:29.948
Just be cool, man.
Just chill out.

32:30.016 --> 32:32.751
Fuck, fuck.

32:32.818 --> 32:34.420
What the fuck?
Motherfuck!

32:34.486 --> 32:36.622
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Hey, hey, hey!

32:36.688 --> 32:39.258
Hey, Freedgood,
just fuckin' calm down, huh?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.627
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.796
[tires screeching]

32:44.863 --> 32:46.632
[chuckles]

32:55.007 --> 32:56.842
FREEDGOOD:
Mario Fucking Andretti, bro.

32:56.908 --> 32:59.111
PERCY: Just tell me the shit's
not at the house.

32:59.178 --> 33:01.580
- Park up the street.
- You're such a douche.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.518
What a ugly fuckin' word.

33:06.585 --> 33:09.488
I don't even understand why
people use that terminology.

33:09.555 --> 33:13.325
Douche. There's so much--
You fucking my car up, bro?

33:13.392 --> 33:15.794
We're gonna have a problem.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.329
[engine shuts off]

33:22.868 --> 33:25.437
Upstairs in my room,

33:25.504 --> 33:28.407
I have a shit ton
of Bolivian marching powder.

33:28.474 --> 33:30.142
Pure.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.079
You're gonna do
your little magic trick.

33:33.145 --> 33:37.083
I don't have my equipment,
and I don't have my scales.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.151
- I can't--
- I got it, all right?

33:39.218 --> 33:42.421
I got all that shit
taken care of.

33:42.488 --> 33:46.024
You cut it, and I'll sell it
tonight at the Black Rabbit.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.493
It's not enough time.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.029
Half of the money
goes to the South Africans.

33:51.097 --> 33:53.265
Plenty left for us.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.367
And what about that cop?

33:55.434 --> 33:58.704
Fuckin' flatfoot pussy
asshole cunt.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.739
Fuck that bitch.

34:00.806 --> 34:03.109
How can you say that?

34:03.175 --> 34:04.943
I'm sorry, man.
You're absolutely right.

34:05.010 --> 34:07.679
I shouldn't-- I shouldn't
use that kind of language.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.248
That's not what I mean.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.117
Look, Percy, all right,
you're not a stupid person,

34:11.183 --> 34:13.452
and I'm not gonna pretend like
you're a fuckin' stupid person.

34:13.518 --> 34:15.321
I'm not gonna insult
your fuckin' intelligence.

34:15.387 --> 34:19.891
You know what I did for you,
all right?

34:19.958 --> 34:23.529
Now I need your help.

34:23.594 --> 34:28.134
This is a real drug deal, bro,
like a legit fucking drug deal.

34:28.199 --> 34:32.838
This is not some college kids
in their dorm like selling pot,

34:32.904 --> 34:35.206
like so I can like fuckin'
act like I'm independent

34:35.274 --> 34:37.842
from my mommy and my daddy.

34:41.045 --> 34:43.081
It's dangerous.

34:43.149 --> 34:44.750
Okay?

34:44.815 --> 34:46.552
High risk, but high reward, bro.

34:46.618 --> 34:50.389
If we pull this off,
you're gonna have so much cash

34:50.456 --> 34:52.991
that you can buy
this fucking house.

34:53.058 --> 34:56.228
And if it goes south?

34:56.295 --> 34:59.265
Well, you know
what they say, right?

34:59.331 --> 35:02.968
You're gonna end up
in prison...

35:03.034 --> 35:06.605
or dead.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.307
Well, yeah.

35:08.374 --> 35:11.109
It's kinda like that.

35:11.177 --> 35:13.179
Think about it.

35:49.715 --> 35:51.450
How was the drive?

35:51.517 --> 35:54.386
It was good.
Whatcha been up to?

35:54.453 --> 35:56.422
Nothin' much.

35:56.488 --> 35:58.290
Just hangin' out?

35:58.357 --> 36:00.792
Yeah, just hangin' out.

36:12.604 --> 36:14.906
- So what do you think?
- I don't wanna do it.

36:14.973 --> 36:17.809
- It's too late for that, baby.
- No, it's not.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.811
It took a lot of effort
to set this up.

36:19.878 --> 36:21.813
Yeah, yeah. Well, I never
asked you to set it up, did I?

36:21.880 --> 36:24.850
You're going to do
very, very well.

36:24.916 --> 36:26.418
How do you know?

36:26.485 --> 36:30.489
Because you are
a man of many talents.

36:30.556 --> 36:31.557
Mm-hmm.

36:39.365 --> 36:42.868
I can't hear you.

36:42.934 --> 36:46.338
I-- No, I can't hear--
I think the audio isn't on.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.508
Do you have me on mute?

36:49.575 --> 36:51.042
No, no, I can't--
I can't hear you.

36:51.109 --> 36:54.079
Can you hear me?
I-I got nothing.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.547
- Now?
- Yes!

36:55.614 --> 36:58.083
That's good, that's good.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.718
Percy Greene.

36:59.785 --> 37:01.052
Yes, ma'am.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.154
How old are you, Percy Greene?

37:03.221 --> 37:05.023
I will be 25 in December.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.358
A Sagittarius.

37:06.425 --> 37:08.026
- Yes.
- Mmm.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.094
Ever the optimist.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.096
Uh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

37:11.162 --> 37:12.964
Can be anything you want to be.

37:13.031 --> 37:14.733
Yeah, I like to think so.

37:14.800 --> 37:17.269
Highly intelligent,
broadminded,

37:17.336 --> 37:22.774
tolerant, idealistic in vision,
but tactless in expression.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.644
Is this part of
the interview or--

37:25.711 --> 37:29.548
Unaware of your ability
to cause anguish in others.

37:29.615 --> 37:32.718
I don't cause anguish
in others.

37:32.784 --> 37:34.820
Percy, my name Megan Weaver.

37:34.886 --> 37:37.356
I am Vice President
of human resources

37:37.423 --> 37:41.026
here at Praxal
Pharmaceutical Industries,

37:41.092 --> 37:44.663
headquartered in beautiful
Wilmington, Delaware.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.465
You ever been
to Delaware, Percy?

37:46.532 --> 37:47.533
No, I haven't.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.669
Consider yourself lucky.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.472
Percy Greene, Percy Greene.

37:53.539 --> 37:56.942
Ah! BS from Hobart College.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.746
Chemical engineering,
3.2 GPA.

38:00.812 --> 38:03.582
Bla bla bla.
Bli bla bla.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.518
- Bla bla bla bla bla.
- Excuse me?

38:06.585 --> 38:08.487
You really are.
You're a cutie.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.221
Does that make you
uncomfortable

38:10.288 --> 38:11.657
when I call you cutie?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.859
What about cutie-pie?

38:13.925 --> 38:15.561
Percy's fine.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.496
Oh, it says here
Dr. Hubbard is making us

38:17.563 --> 38:18.930
go through with this.

38:18.997 --> 38:22.568
How do you know Dr. Hubbard,
cutie-pie?

38:22.634 --> 38:24.736
He's, uh, he's a friend of--

38:24.803 --> 38:26.705
Just spell it out for me,
will ya?

38:26.772 --> 38:28.574
They thought that
I might be able to--

38:28.640 --> 38:30.742
They thought you might
work for Praxal.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.011
That's not gonna happen, Percy.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.179
Why not?

38:34.245 --> 38:37.048
Because you're not qualified.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.385
What about my degree?

38:39.451 --> 38:41.052
Well, 10, 15 years ago,

38:41.119 --> 38:42.988
maybe it would have been
a different story,

38:43.054 --> 38:45.056
but now you have
to have a master's

38:45.123 --> 38:47.225
even to have an interview.

38:47.292 --> 38:49.127
Can you get one of those?

38:49.194 --> 38:51.196
That costs like $100,000.

38:51.262 --> 38:52.398
Maybe.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.600
Like, yeah.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.437
If I get a master's degree,
I get a job?

38:58.504 --> 39:01.907
I doubt it. We're outsourcing
everything to India.

39:01.973 --> 39:05.110
Chemists there
are a dime a dozen.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.779
They're smarter than us.

39:07.846 --> 39:10.849
They're gonna bury us all.

39:10.916 --> 39:14.052
We've sealed our fate, Percy,
as a company.

39:14.119 --> 39:16.054
Hell, as a country.

39:16.121 --> 39:17.456
You're fucked.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.526
I'm fucked.
This country is--

39:27.799 --> 39:30.402
[wheezing]

39:30.469 --> 39:35.407
Can I confess something to you,
Percy?Cutie-pie?

39:35.474 --> 39:37.075
I just got pink-slipped.

39:37.142 --> 39:40.779
Downsized, fired,
given the heave-ho.

39:40.846 --> 39:41.747
Mmm.

39:41.813 --> 39:46.051
So I am getting drunk.
Mm-hmm.

39:46.117 --> 39:50.922
I have wasted my life
in this hellhole.

39:53.959 --> 39:58.329
God, you're really--
You're really cute, Percy.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.766
I wish I was out there with you
in sunny California

40:00.832 --> 40:02.434
because I would give you

40:02.501 --> 40:06.404
a serious fucking chemistry
lesson, let me tell you.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.237
Cleaned my room?

40:39.304 --> 40:41.940
It was a bloody mess.

40:42.007 --> 40:43.308
Had a nosebleed.

40:43.374 --> 40:46.377
Do you get a lot of those?

40:46.444 --> 40:48.714
Have a seat.

40:53.852 --> 40:56.254
You wanna know
what's in the bag?

40:56.321 --> 41:00.225
- It's none of my business.
- It is your business.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.528
Close your eyes.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.943
Oh.

41:21.412 --> 41:22.447
My God.

41:22.514 --> 41:23.682
Here.

41:23.749 --> 41:27.819
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

41:30.388 --> 41:32.591
I remember when you saw 'em
in the window.

41:32.658 --> 41:35.493
- Freedgood.
- You said you'd die for a pair.

41:35.561 --> 41:37.262
They're incredible, but I can't.

41:37.328 --> 41:38.363
You're welcome.

41:38.429 --> 41:42.033
I can't. You know I can't.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.343
CORTEZ: Very nice shoes.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.245
You kept them.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.116
I have them, yes.

41:58.183 --> 42:01.152
You think that's
the right thing to do?

42:01.219 --> 42:03.254
I'd say I earned them.

42:03.321 --> 42:05.423
You were never serious
about a life with him.

42:05.490 --> 42:08.126
I appreciate
what he had to offer.

42:08.193 --> 42:10.261
But he did not take
your response well.

42:10.328 --> 42:14.265
He was never one
to take no for an answer.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.212
So how did it go?

42:27.278 --> 42:29.014
Oh, just...

42:29.080 --> 42:32.083
the most amazing interview
I've ever had in my life.

42:32.150 --> 42:33.018
So it went well?

42:33.084 --> 42:35.286
Oh, like you can't imagine.

42:35.353 --> 42:36.421
You got an offer?

42:36.487 --> 42:40.558
[laughs]
For a job?

42:40.626 --> 42:42.193
Why is that so funny?

42:42.260 --> 42:44.295
- There's no job.
- No job?

42:44.362 --> 42:46.231
No, not in this lifetime.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.367
What did you say?

42:49.434 --> 42:52.270
- I didn't say anything.
- What did you do?

42:52.337 --> 42:54.372
I didn't do anything.

42:54.439 --> 42:56.441
So you sabotaged it?

42:56.507 --> 42:58.176
- She was drunk.
- You lie.

42:58.243 --> 42:59.310
I'm not lying.

42:59.377 --> 43:01.112
My mom got Carl
to set that up.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.815
Aw, fuck that guy.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.017
Because you don't want a job?

43:06.084 --> 43:08.386
You hate your stepfather.
So does your mom.

43:08.453 --> 43:10.822
What's the big deal?

43:10.889 --> 43:14.292
Percy, you are a very talented
guitar player,

43:14.359 --> 43:17.162
and if you keep on practicing,
you could be great.

43:17.228 --> 43:18.764
Thanks, babe.

43:18.830 --> 43:21.667
But playing your guitar for free
is not a job.

43:52.163 --> 43:55.867
- [Freedgood laughing]
- What's that all about?

43:59.537 --> 44:03.241
** [blues continues]

44:07.445 --> 44:09.748
He wants to go shopping.

44:14.686 --> 44:17.055
He asked me to go with him.

44:21.893 --> 44:25.130
He's gonna whisper
sweet nothings into my ear

44:25.196 --> 44:27.165
and seduce me,

44:27.232 --> 44:30.201
do unspeakable things to me
that you can't even imagine.

44:31.669 --> 44:32.904
What, babe?

44:32.971 --> 44:35.340
** [continues]

44:35.406 --> 44:38.744
So hungry I could eat
a fucking giraffe.

44:40.445 --> 44:43.148
Vamanos, senorita.

44:45.550 --> 44:48.053
I'll get dressed then.

44:48.119 --> 44:50.255
I'ma keep her out until six,

44:50.321 --> 44:53.424
which means there's not a lot
of time, so hurry the fuck up.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.829
Chop-chop.

45:20.385 --> 45:23.354
** [reggae]

45:47.645 --> 45:49.080
[phone vibrating]

45:51.917 --> 45:53.151
Bonjour, Papa.

45:53.218 --> 45:56.387
Number-one son.
How was the interview?

45:56.454 --> 45:57.823
Catastrophic.

45:57.889 --> 46:00.425
Well, you can't move to
New York without a job, Percy.

46:00.491 --> 46:02.460
That city will chew you up
and crap you out.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.829
You gotta have an income.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.530
What are you gonna do
for money?

46:05.596 --> 46:07.365
Haven't you guys been
fighting about this all summer?

46:07.432 --> 46:09.367
Yeah, more and more.
I think it's--

46:09.434 --> 46:12.137
I think it's
getting out of hand.

46:12.203 --> 46:13.571
Veronica's beautiful,
all right?

46:13.638 --> 46:15.206
She's smart, she loves you,

46:15.273 --> 46:16.674
and she wants what's
best for you, all right?

46:16.741 --> 46:17.742
You won the lottery there,

46:17.809 --> 46:19.444
but there are no shortcuts.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.212
You have to put in the time
if want to earn the dime.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.081
That's a shit lyric, Dad.

46:23.148 --> 46:25.183
Don't mean it ain't true.
You're half-assing music,

46:25.250 --> 46:26.818
and you're half-assing
chemistry,

46:26.885 --> 46:29.187
and no fruit of my loins
is gonna be a half-asser.

46:29.254 --> 46:31.189
We are not half-asser people.

46:31.256 --> 46:33.024
Hey, Dad, can I call you back?

46:33.091 --> 46:34.692
Kind of in the middle
of something.

46:34.759 --> 46:36.561
- Get cracking.
- I'll talk to you later, okay?

46:36.627 --> 46:38.463
Percy, we're not done
talking about this.

46:38.529 --> 46:40.365
Bye.

46:40.431 --> 46:45.803
** [reggae]

46:45.871 --> 46:47.939
You get a lot of support
from home?

46:49.640 --> 46:53.311
My stepfather paid
for my tuition. That's it.

46:53.378 --> 46:57.115
And your father
had a checkered past

46:57.182 --> 47:00.151
when it came to his relationship
with the law.

47:00.218 --> 47:03.154
He was a serial entrepreneur.

47:03.221 --> 47:06.892
- Get-rich-quick schemes.
- Something like that.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.793
Not always on the up-and-up.

47:08.860 --> 47:13.564
He was a good man,
and he loved my mother.

47:13.631 --> 47:16.634
When she left him,
it broke his heart.

47:16.701 --> 47:18.436
You wanna help Percy,

47:18.503 --> 47:20.771
and Freedgood
owns a nightclub.

47:20.838 --> 47:23.541
He had contacts
in the music business.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.543
I thought he could
give Percy a leg up.

47:25.610 --> 47:29.714
So you invited your ex-lover
to spend the night.

47:29.780 --> 47:31.582
He called me,

47:31.649 --> 47:33.952
and it had been a long time.

47:34.019 --> 47:36.187
He was friends with Percy, too.

47:36.254 --> 47:38.856
I didn't think anything of it.

47:38.924 --> 47:40.258
You wanted
to make him jealous,

47:40.325 --> 47:42.193
make him see
what he was missing

47:42.260 --> 47:44.429
if he didn't compromise.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.197
Maybe.

47:48.499 --> 47:51.436
A little bit, yeah.

47:51.502 --> 47:53.638
Percy doesn't care
about money.

47:53.704 --> 47:56.207
Money brings security.

47:56.274 --> 47:59.110
What do you know
about security?

47:59.177 --> 48:01.980
I know Percy
can't provide any.

48:02.047 --> 48:05.283
You're just jealous.

48:05.350 --> 48:07.418
God's magical
little creature.

48:07.485 --> 48:11.189
You know, maybe
I'll provide the security.

48:11.256 --> 48:12.924
No one gives a fuck
about how special you are

48:12.991 --> 48:14.492
in the real world.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.094
No ribbons
for just showing up.

48:16.161 --> 48:18.729
You need a roof
over your head,

48:18.796 --> 48:20.731
plate of food on the table.

48:20.798 --> 48:22.934
My job will do that.

48:24.202 --> 48:26.304
How's your health?

48:26.371 --> 48:28.473
Fine.

48:28.539 --> 48:30.775
And if you lose your job,
what then?

48:30.841 --> 48:33.178
Don't worry about it.

48:33.244 --> 48:36.647
Why'd you invite me
to stay the night?

48:36.714 --> 48:38.316
I was being polite.

48:38.383 --> 48:41.152
You know, I thought
we could all be friends.

48:41.219 --> 48:44.255
Were we friends
last Thanksgiving?

48:44.322 --> 48:47.625
- Things happen for a reason.
- That's bullshit.

48:47.692 --> 48:51.162
People make things happen.

48:51.229 --> 48:53.164
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

48:53.231 --> 48:56.567
And those people
have their reasons.

48:56.634 --> 48:59.104
I don't get it.

48:59.170 --> 49:03.174
I mean, what can he do for you
that I can't?

49:03.241 --> 49:07.378
He's the only person
in the world that,

49:07.445 --> 49:10.015
when I look at him,
I just see calm.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.557
He asked me to do it again.

49:19.624 --> 49:20.992
A drug deal?

49:21.059 --> 49:24.662
He said he didn't want to
get a job, and he was tired.

49:24.729 --> 49:26.731
Said I don't know what and,
you know.

49:26.797 --> 49:30.035
No, Percy's not a drug dealer.

but it lets you know it's there.

50:39.704 --> 50:42.407
Good work, man.
There'll always be work for you.

50:42.473 --> 50:44.575
Oh, he wants
to meet you tonight.

50:44.642 --> 50:45.910
Who?

50:45.976 --> 50:47.578
Andre Horowitz, who else?

50:47.645 --> 50:48.679
Really?

50:48.746 --> 50:50.248
- Really.
- When?

50:50.315 --> 50:52.049
Like tonight.

50:52.117 --> 50:53.751
- Where?
- The Black Rabbit.

50:53.818 --> 50:56.053
Man, I'm not going
to any Black Rabbit, okay?

50:56.121 --> 50:57.722
I have to be here.

50:57.788 --> 50:59.724
Do you love her?

50:59.790 --> 51:01.326
Heart and soul.

51:01.392 --> 51:04.629
- You think she loves you?
- I know she does.

51:04.695 --> 51:07.098
- It's not gonna end well.
- You know what?

51:07.165 --> 51:09.734
You don't know half as much
as you think you do, Freedgood.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.171
- She's gonna lie to you.
- [phone vibrating]

51:13.238 --> 51:14.705
Fuckin', fuckin' phone.

51:16.174 --> 51:17.842
Hold on.

51:17.908 --> 51:20.044
Hello.

51:20.111 --> 51:23.514
Yes, it'll be
a banner night tonight.

51:23.581 --> 51:26.251
Yes, he did a great job
just like I told you.

51:27.985 --> 51:29.287
Okay.

51:29.354 --> 51:31.489
I'm on my way.

51:31.556 --> 51:33.458
No, no, you have a great day.

51:33.524 --> 51:34.892
Ciao.

51:34.959 --> 51:36.494
Fuck him.

51:36.561 --> 51:37.628
Fuck.

51:37.695 --> 51:40.064
She's already started
lying to you.

51:40.131 --> 51:43.201
Am I getting my money tonight?

51:43.268 --> 51:46.804
Where were you
last Thanksgiving?

51:46.871 --> 51:49.307
What?

51:49.374 --> 51:51.209
Last Thanksgiving,
where were you?

51:51.276 --> 51:52.743
Uh, I don't know.

51:52.810 --> 51:55.846
I was in Burlington, Vermont,
with my band Crabcake.

51:55.913 --> 51:57.114
We had a gig.

51:57.182 --> 51:59.150
Where was Veronica?

51:59.217 --> 52:01.352
Home.

52:01.419 --> 52:04.455
You sure about that?

52:06.391 --> 52:09.294
CORTEZ: What happened
over Thanksgiving?

52:09.360 --> 52:12.330
I went home to Westchester.

52:12.397 --> 52:14.865
Percy was supposed to come,

52:14.932 --> 52:20.004
but last minute, he got a gig
with his band in Burlington.

52:20.070 --> 52:22.006
We fought about it,

52:22.072 --> 52:26.211
but he said how the Wednesday
night before Thanksgiving

52:26.277 --> 52:29.747
is the biggest bar night
of the year, and...

52:29.814 --> 52:32.149
they just had to play.

52:32.217 --> 52:34.151
So you called Freedgood.

52:34.219 --> 52:35.853
He called me.

52:35.920 --> 52:38.223
Freedgood was a good talker.

52:38.289 --> 52:42.993
I was lonely and angry at Percy.

52:43.060 --> 52:45.363
You went to see Freedgood.

52:45.430 --> 52:48.899
He came and got me.

52:48.966 --> 52:52.002
CORTEZ: Percy didn't know.

52:52.069 --> 52:53.838
Does now.

53:01.512 --> 53:03.080
VERONICA: Trying something new?

53:03.147 --> 53:06.284
PERCY: It's not new.
It's just a different style.

53:06.351 --> 53:09.287
VERONICA: Well, you wanna
tell me about it?

53:09.354 --> 53:10.788
PERCY: Wouldn't interest you.

53:10.855 --> 53:13.924
I'm interested in you,
Percy Greene,

53:13.991 --> 53:16.427
and everything that you do.

53:16.494 --> 53:19.196
Are you still interested in me?

53:19.264 --> 53:21.599
Oh, I'm interested in you,
Veronica,

53:21.666 --> 53:25.303
and everything that you do.

53:25.370 --> 53:27.872
Are you interested in Freedgood?

53:42.487 --> 53:44.855
VERONICA: So that's it for us?

53:44.922 --> 53:47.224
PERCY: I feel like
I've done my part.

53:47.292 --> 53:49.394
VERONICA:
But we're not done yet.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.961
PERCY: Not quite.

53:52.363 --> 53:56.334
VERONICA: You should stay here
in LA.

53:57.668 --> 54:00.405
What, and you go back
to New York?

54:00.471 --> 54:04.141
Maybe it'd be better.

54:04.208 --> 54:07.312
After everything
that's happened.

54:07.378 --> 54:10.915
And everything
that's going to happen.

54:12.950 --> 54:16.120
VERONICA: What is there
left to do?

Yeah, well,
it's not my beautiful house.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.738
Told you he'd be upset.

Hey, everybody out!

doing in the house?

55:50.080 --> 55:51.916
We still gotta pay
the South Africans, man.

55:51.982 --> 55:54.351
Those fuckin' maniacs?
You brought 'em to the house?

55:54.419 --> 55:57.154
We're gonna pay 'em,
and that's gonna be it, bro.

55:57.221 --> 55:58.656
Relax, okay?

55:58.723 --> 56:02.727
Now I just want you to meet
my man, Andre Horowitz.

56:02.793 --> 56:05.730
Andre! Dre, come here, bro.

56:05.796 --> 56:07.465

I been telling you about.

Percy Motherfuckin' Greene.

56:10.134 --> 56:11.602
Mr. Horowitz.

56:11.669 --> 56:13.370
You gonna get it on tonight?

56:13.438 --> 56:16.073
Nah, nah.
I wasn't planning on it.

56:16.140 --> 56:17.307
You're jerking my chain.

56:17.374 --> 56:19.677
- No.
- Right.

56:19.744 --> 56:23.380
See, I seen your kind before.
You probably got a little skill.

56:23.448 --> 56:24.882
You look the part,

56:24.949 --> 56:27.084
but when the heat's on,
you fold.

56:27.151 --> 56:29.854
So I'm gonna give you
a little advice, white boy.

56:29.920 --> 56:32.823
It takes more than skill
to be successful

56:32.890 --> 56:34.725
- at one's chosen field.
- What does it take?

56:34.792 --> 56:38.228
It takes equal part talent,
motherfuckin' skill...

56:38.295 --> 56:39.329
Oh.

56:39.396 --> 56:40.731
...and nerve.

56:40.798 --> 56:43.934
It's a quality you sadly lack.

56:45.503 --> 56:46.871
Good night.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.239
I can play.

56:49.306 --> 56:53.243
Then get your fuckin'
hands off me and play.

56:53.310 --> 56:55.680
Play for them tomorrow.

56:55.746 --> 56:57.147
What, you're afraid
it's gonna go well?

56:57.214 --> 56:59.750
I'm afraid they're
burning down the house.

56:59.817 --> 57:01.952
As long as poor little Percy's
a nobody,

57:02.019 --> 57:03.120
you can push him around,

57:03.187 --> 57:05.556
make him part of your
little schemes, huh?

57:05.623 --> 57:07.191
Percy, that's not true.

57:07.257 --> 57:09.660
I've always been there to
support you when you needed it.

57:09.727 --> 57:12.362
Always. And now I got
a chance to do something,

57:12.429 --> 57:14.932
and you're not supporting me,
you're sitting here in bed.

57:14.999 --> 57:18.135
- That's not what this is about.
- Then what's it about?

57:18.202 --> 57:19.937
This is about being careful.

57:20.004 --> 57:23.207
I mean, Freedgood is mixed up
with a whole bunch of people,

57:23.273 --> 57:25.976
people we don't even know about.

57:26.043 --> 57:29.814
This is about
not getting arrested or worse.

How can it be older?

Good thing we brought this

What?

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:51.501

I think he may need
a doctor, eh?

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:08.372
Nah. I've seen Percy like this
a thousand times.

01:05:08.438 --> 01:05:09.639
He's a trouper.

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.976
We don't have all fuckin' night,
Freedgood.

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.011
So how about you get the guns
from the car,

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:17.814
and you pay
for the ones you want.

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:19.383
Yeah.

01:05:19.449 --> 01:05:22.119

Hey, hey, how you doing?

This is the, uh,
South Africans' car, okay?

01:08:11.355 --> 01:08:12.856
So they were
so fucked up last night

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:14.791
that Phee-Bee had to fucking
give 'em a ride home,

01:08:14.858 --> 01:08:16.292

take it back for 'em.

Fuckin' crack high, dude.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:23.733
We gotta get this car
to their house.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.068
You want me to drive?

01:08:25.135 --> 01:08:26.636
Remember the cop
that was here last night?

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:29.273
- There was a fucking cop?
- There was a fucking cop here!

01:08:29.339 --> 01:08:30.840
He's probably watching us
right now, okay?

01:08:30.907 --> 01:08:32.609
If he decides to come
and fuck with us,

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.278
he's gonna find
what's in that trunk.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.912
- What's in the trunk?
- The fucking drugs!

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.250
- You sold the drugs last night.
- We don't want this car here!

01:08:40.317 --> 01:08:44.720
- We don't want this car here!
- Keep your voice down, okay?

01:08:45.788 --> 01:08:46.956

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:25.929
Hey, Ma.
Top of the morning.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.631
How is LA treating
my number one dude?

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.734
- Pretty good, Ma, pretty good.
- Is that right?

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.969
Just hookers, blow,
drug deals.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:35.071
- Uh, hilarious.
- You know how it is.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:36.540
Listen, the Yeptides wanna have

01:09:36.606 --> 01:09:38.375
a welcome-home dinner
for you Thursday.

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:41.077
I know you think
she's a nut-job, but--

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:42.946
I'm not gonna take
that flight.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.348
You're not coming home?

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.582
No, I got a thing here in LA.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:48.917
- [thump]
- A thing?What thing?

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:52.020
Babe, I've already made
chocolate ganache for you.

01:09:52.087 --> 01:09:54.458
- Okay, I'll save it.
- Oh, shit.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.260
Is the thing Veronica?

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:57.827
Yeah, she wants to skedaddle.

01:09:57.894 --> 01:10:00.764
Oh, Perce,
I know how you feel about her.

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.533
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too, me too.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.369
So what's your plan?

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.571
Might just have to stay here
for a while.

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:09.673
Seriously? In LA?
By yourself?

01:10:09.739 --> 01:10:12.309
You gonna sleep in your car?
That's a terrible idea.

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:13.910
Yeah, you're so right, Ma.

01:10:13.977 --> 01:10:17.180
Don't patronize me, punk.
I believe in you.

01:10:17.247 --> 01:10:21.585
And if she doesn't,
maybe you gotta let her go.

01:10:54.418 --> 01:10:56.753
- Hey, he was following me.
- Who?

01:10:56.820 --> 01:10:57.687
The cop.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:10:59.423
Well, that's a big shock.

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:01.625
Why are you wiping the car down?

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.427
Because I don't wanna
get caught.

01:11:03.493 --> 01:11:06.129
- What does he want?
- He wants what everybody wants.

01:11:06.195 --> 01:11:07.831
You owe him money?

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.699
Cost of doing business.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.535
What's in the trunk, Freedgood?

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.503
- Finish wiping down the inside.

Oh, good. You're almost ready.
Let's go.

You can't be serious.

01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:35.044
- Nah, I'll help you.
- You gotta be kidding.

Come on, I'm not going
with anyone, all right?

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:40.450
Why do you think you're so much
better than everybody?

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.788
You shouldn't have come.

you deserve?

You take it.

No, you tell me how much
you think you deserve,

01:14:16.753 --> 01:14:18.555
and I'll see
if that's what I give you.

01:14:18.622 --> 01:14:21.858
Wouldn't take a red cent of
your filthy fuckin' drug money.

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:24.661
Name a number.
What is it, like ten thousand?

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:27.931
Tell you what I want,
Freedgood.

01:14:27.997 --> 01:14:30.366
I want you to
get the fuck out of my life

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:32.468
and never come back.

Yeah, you heard me.
Now fuck off.

You know what
I'm gonna do for you?

Oh, look at that.

Freedgood doesn't take no

Be clear with me.

He came back for Veronica.

01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:52.161
You're college-educated adults.

01:23:52.228 --> 01:23:54.963
You need to take responsibility
for your actions.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:56.031
- [cocks gun]
- Fuck.

01:23:56.099 --> 01:23:57.966
This is your last chance.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:01.837
I'm gonna leave you both
at the bottom off that pool.

01:24:01.904 --> 01:24:04.473
Why would we have it?
Maybe the South Africans--

01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:08.311
Maybe--
Maybe Andre Horowitz has it.

01:24:09.578 --> 01:24:11.614
ANDRE: Percy Motherfuckin'
Greene.

01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:13.182
FREEDGOOD: The guy I been
telling you about.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.983
PERCY: What do you know about
Andre Horowitz?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.419
ANDRE: It takes
equal part talent,

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:19.021
motherfuckin' skill
and nerve.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.824
It's a quality you sadly lack.

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:24.527
I can play.

01:24:26.862 --> 01:24:29.365
ANDRE: Then get your fuckin'
hands off me and play.

01:24:34.437 --> 01:24:37.840
There is no Andre Horowitz.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:44.447
Where is it?!

01:24:46.014 --> 01:24:49.752
[no audible dialogue]

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:51.387
He's gonna come see us.

01:24:51.454 --> 01:24:54.223
FREEDGOOD:
She's gonna lie to you.

01:24:57.926 --> 01:24:59.595
[no audible dialogue]

01:24:59.662 --> 01:25:02.498
VERONICA: He was
a serial entrepreneur.

01:25:02.565 --> 01:25:04.099
CORTEZ: Get-rich-quick schemes.

01:25:04.167 --> 01:25:05.568
VERONICA: Something like that.

01:25:05.634 --> 01:25:08.371
FREEDGOOD: What do you want,
twenty-five, fifty?

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:11.274
VERONICA: It took a lot of
effort to set this up.

01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:12.941
[no audible dialogue]

01:25:13.008 --> 01:25:15.511
PERCY: You don't know half as
much as you think you do.

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:19.248
VERONICA: You are going
to do very, very well.

01:25:20.749 --> 01:25:23.852
VERONICA: You are a man
of many talents.

01:25:27.323 --> 01:25:28.691
[Freedgood laughing]

01:25:28.757 --> 01:25:31.694
MEGAN: Praxal Pharmaceutical
Industries

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:34.062
headquartered in beautiful
Wilmington, Delaware.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.633
FREEDGOOD: Well done, Percy.
Well fuckin' done.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:45.808
- PERCY: If we'd known it was--
- VERONICA: Please let us go.

01:25:45.874 --> 01:25:47.042
CORTEZ: You should've
thought about that

01:25:47.109 --> 01:25:48.110
before you tried to steal it.

01:25:48.177 --> 01:25:50.446
- Please!
- Aaahh!

01:25:50.513 --> 01:25:51.980
[click]

01:25:52.047 --> 01:25:53.916
[gasps]

01:25:58.354 --> 01:26:00.589
You wanna know
a little secret?

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:02.958
I like you guys,
you know that?

01:26:03.025 --> 01:26:06.662
Freedgood was a piece of shit.
You guys did me a favor.

01:26:06.729 --> 01:26:09.365
- Fuck you.
- Get your bags. Let's go.

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:44.099
CORTEZ: Was anything
you told me true

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:47.436
or was it all bullshit?

01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:51.139
VERONICA: The closer you stick
to the truth,

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.942
the easier it is to lie.
