00:38.030 --> 00:40.260
Scott Pilgrim is
dating a high-schooler?

00:40.670 --> 00:42.570
Really? Is she hot?

00:42.640 --> 00:44.970
How old are you now,
Scott? Like, 28?

00:45.040 --> 00:46.870
I'm not playing your
little games, kids.

00:46.940 --> 00:49.340
So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.

00:49.410 --> 00:52.070
I'm 22. Twenty-two.

00:53.710 --> 00:56.550
And you're dating a high-school
girl. Not bad, not bad.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.620
Thank you, thank you.

00:58.690 --> 01:03.050
So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?

01:03.690 --> 01:05.489
We have done many things.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.030
We ride the bus together.

01:07.330 --> 01:11.460
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

01:11.530 --> 01:14.630
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

01:15.070 --> 01:16.470
Have you
even kissed her?

01:16.540 --> 01:18.940
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

01:19.010 --> 01:20.340
Well, aren't you
pleased as punch.

01:20.410 --> 01:21.570
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:21.640 --> 01:22.700
So, what's her name?

01:23.440 --> 01:25.410
Knives Chau.

01:26.210 --> 01:27.370
She's Chinese.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.210
Wicked.

01:30.280 --> 01:31.480
So, when do we
get to meet her?

01:31.550 --> 01:33.110
Oh, please,
let it be soon.

01:33.420 --> 01:35.050
That's for me.

01:37.790 --> 01:39.690
Hi.
You promise to be good?

01:39.760 --> 01:40.950
Of course I'll be good.

01:41.090 --> 01:42.290
Seriously,
please be good.

01:42.560 --> 01:43.960
Am I normally not?

01:44.560 --> 01:47.690
Hey, Knives, this is Stephen
Stills. He's the talent.

01:48.440 --> 01:50.060
Hey.

01:50.870 --> 01:51.860
Is she gonna
geek out on us?

01:51.940 --> 01:53.060
She'll just sit
in the corner, man.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.200
I mean, I want her
to geek out on us.

01:55.280 --> 01:58.510
She'll geek. She geeks.
She has the capacity to geek.

01:58.580 --> 01:59.740
Okay.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.140
You're good.

02:06.590 --> 02:07.640
Wow.

02:07.720 --> 02:08.750
Here, let me
get your coat.

02:08.820 --> 02:10.050
Hi.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.590
Knives, that's Kim.

02:12.660 --> 02:13.850
Sorry,
what was your name?

02:14.190 --> 02:15.180
Kim.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.890
And you play the drums?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.660
Yes.

02:18.730 --> 02:20.600
That is so awesome.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.430
Knives, that's Young Neil.

02:22.800 --> 02:24.000
Hi.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.470
Hi.

02:25.610 --> 02:27.330
What do you play?

02:28.380 --> 02:34.110
<i>Wow, Zelda, Tetris.</i>

02:35.080 --> 02:36.710
That's kind of
a big question.

02:37.650 --> 02:40.020
<i>Okay, let's start
with Launchpad McQuack.</i>

02:40.090 --> 02:41.580
That's not
the actual title of the...

02:41.660 --> 02:43.420
We are Sex Bob-Omb!

02:43.490 --> 02:44.920
One, two, three, four!

02:51.400 --> 02:53.260
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

02:54.100 --> 02:55.620
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

02:56.370 --> 02:58.630
<i>Laminate the stasis</i>

02:58.710 --> 03:01.540
<i>Mama, mama serpentine</i>

03:01.610 --> 03:04.200
<i>I got a breathalyzer</i>

03:04.280 --> 03:06.710
<i>And my body's clean</i>

03:13.750 --> 03:15.880
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

03:41.510 --> 03:43.040
<i>Thank you!</i>

04:04.800 --> 04:06.360
<i>Get ready</i>

04:08.410 --> 04:09.500
<i>Yeah</i>

04:25.260 --> 04:26.820
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

04:27.930 --> 04:29.400
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:37.200
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

04:37.270 --> 04:38.640
<i>Yeah!</i>

04:43.510 --> 04:46.780
You guys are so

04:48.720 --> 04:51.010
amazing.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.520
She seems nice.
Yeah.

04:52.590 --> 04:53.680
Yeah, she seems awesome.

04:53.950 --> 04:54.940
Yeah.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.510
Scott, if your life had
a face, I would punch it.

04:57.590 --> 04:59.650
Yeah. Wait, what?

04:59.730 --> 05:02.660
I mean, are you really happy
or are you really evil?

05:03.330 --> 05:05.090
Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?

05:05.170 --> 05:06.330
I'm offended, Kim.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.590
Wounded, even?

05:08.130 --> 05:09.190
Hurt, Kim.

05:09.270 --> 05:10.740
You? Hurt?

05:11.970 --> 05:14.240
Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome.''

05:14.610 --> 05:16.010
Yeah, she seems awesome.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.340
Yeah.

05:22.680 --> 05:24.480
Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,

05:24.550 --> 05:26.110
yes, I'm dating
a 17-year-old.

05:26.720 --> 05:27.740
Oh, is he cute?

05:28.920 --> 05:31.150
Does this mean we have
to stop sleeping together?

05:31.220 --> 05:33.520
You see another bed in here?

05:33.730 --> 05:36.660
Yeah. You're totally
my bitch forever.

05:45.510 --> 05:48.800
So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.

05:48.880 --> 05:50.600
Hey, you know me.

05:50.680 --> 05:51.870
I mean, don't tell my sister.

05:53.710 --> 05:54.840
You know me.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.140
Who are you texting?

05:58.820 --> 06:00.720
Seventeen years old?
Scandal!

06:00.790 --> 06:02.480
That's not true.
Who told you?

06:02.560 --> 06:03.580
Wallace. Duh.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.920
That gossipy bitch.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.380
You know me.

06:06.460 --> 06:07.450
Wallace!

06:07.990 --> 06:09.590
Who is this
mystery child you date?

06:09.660 --> 06:11.860
Her name's Knives Chau.
She's Chinese.

06:12.570 --> 06:17.130
A 17-year-old Chinese
schoolgirl? You're ridiculous.

06:17.200 --> 06:18.760
It's a Catholic school, too.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.140
With the uniform
and everything?

06:20.270 --> 06:21.570
Yeah. The whole deal.

06:22.710 --> 06:24.230
Oh, my God.
You guys haven't...

06:24.310 --> 06:27.040
No, no, no, no. We haven't
even held hands yet.

06:27.110 --> 06:29.140
I think she hugged me once.

06:29.220 --> 06:31.270
Scott,
why are you doing this?

06:31.350 --> 06:35.010
I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.520
It's been over a year
since you got dumped

06:36.590 --> 06:38.850
by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named.
So...

06:40.390 --> 06:41.620
Are you
legitimately moving on

06:41.690 --> 06:43.390
or is this just
you being insane?

06:43.800 --> 06:45.420
Can I get back
to you on that?

06:48.470 --> 06:50.440
I do not wanna
be here at all.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.530
This school
has boys, too.

06:53.040 --> 06:57.140
I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.400
Well, she's only
allowed out

06:58.480 --> 07:00.540
when the sun is up,
so I wouldn't call it dating.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.950
It's more like...
Playtime?

07:03.020 --> 07:04.680
That doesn't sound so good, either. No.

07:04.750 --> 07:05.910
Scott!

07:06.350 --> 07:07.340
Hey, Knives.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.510
This is my cool, gay
roommate, Wallace Wells.

07:09.590 --> 07:10.750
Hi.
He's gay.

07:11.060 --> 07:13.530
Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?

07:13.590 --> 07:15.120
Yes, does he wear glasses?

07:15.200 --> 07:17.430
Wallace, you go now. Begone.

07:19.930 --> 07:22.490
You're too good
for him. Run.

07:25.610 --> 07:26.900
<i>Get ready!</i>

07:27.570 --> 07:28.600
<i>Here we go!</i>

07:33.510 --> 07:36.140
<i>Did you know that the original
name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?</i>

07:36.650 --> 07:38.480
You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

07:38.550 --> 07:40.990
<i>but it actually comes from the
Japanese phrase "paku-paku,"</i>

07:41.050 --> 07:42.780
which means, "to flap one's
mouth open and closed.''

07:44.520 --> 07:45.620
They changed it
because they thought that

07:45.690 --> 07:47.460
<i>"Puck-Man" would be
too easy to vandalize.</i>

07:47.530 --> 07:48.650
You know,
people could just scratch off

07:48.730 --> 07:50.360
the "P" and turn it
into an "F" or whatever.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.020
Oh, my God! Like, wow!

07:54.170 --> 07:55.430
<i>Combo!</i>

07:59.040 --> 08:00.060
Yeah. Wow.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.200
<i>Continue?</i>

08:01.270 --> 08:06.640
<i>Nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four,</i>

08:06.710 --> 08:08.040
<i>three...
Oh, I got it.</i>

08:08.110 --> 08:09.340
<i>...two, one.</i>

08:13.190 --> 08:15.210
I don't listen
to that much music.

08:15.290 --> 08:18.420
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

08:19.160 --> 08:21.090
You guys rock.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.690
Well, I knew
I personally rocked,

08:22.760 --> 08:25.360
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.590
So, thank you, Knives.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.930
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

08:29.370 --> 08:30.770
Well, we're already
pretty big,

08:30.840 --> 08:32.360
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

08:32.440 --> 08:34.669
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

08:34.740 --> 08:36.470
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

08:36.539 --> 08:39.880
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

08:39.950 --> 08:43.380
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

08:43.450 --> 08:44.920
Thank you, Julie.

08:45.050 --> 08:46.540
Are you coming
to my party Friday,

08:46.620 --> 08:49.490
or will you be
busy babysitting?

08:50.060 --> 08:52.250
Thank you, Julie.

08:52.330 --> 08:53.880
You don't want
to listen to her.

08:54.390 --> 08:56.760
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.520
Oh, I heart them so much.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.130
Yeah, I hearted them, too, until
they signed to a major label,

09:02.200 --> 09:05.930
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

09:06.010 --> 09:07.530
But that's just me.

09:07.610 --> 09:11.040
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

09:11.110 --> 09:12.670
Sorry, you were
saying about me?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.680
I mean, I've never gone
out with anyone so talented.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.080
Go out with
a lot of guys?

09:17.150 --> 09:18.140
No.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.550
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

09:20.620 --> 09:22.490
I've never even
kissed a guy.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.520
Hey,

09:28.330 --> 09:29.560
me, neither.

09:41.370 --> 09:43.210
Here you go.

09:43.280 --> 09:44.640
So, this is
your secret lair?

09:44.710 --> 09:46.440
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

09:46.950 --> 09:49.510
My secret lair
is one of those

09:49.580 --> 09:51.350
"No girls allowed"- type
deals.

09:51.580 --> 09:52.680
Okay.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.240
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

09:54.320 --> 09:55.910
Sure!
Come on.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.180
There you go.

10:00.690 --> 10:01.990
Wow.

10:02.360 --> 10:03.350
Yeah.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.690
Wow.

10:13.240 --> 10:14.710
Oh, God.

10:17.340 --> 10:18.970
So alone.

10:20.650 --> 10:22.010
You're not alone.

10:22.250 --> 10:23.510
What?

10:23.580 --> 10:26.310
You're just having
some idiotic dream.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.980
Does that mean
we can make out?

10:29.060 --> 10:30.850
Oh, God!

10:30.920 --> 10:31.950
What is it, Scott?

10:32.030 --> 10:33.190
I had this
totally weird dream.

10:33.260 --> 10:34.490
Oh, God.

10:34.560 --> 10:35.790
What is it,
Other Scott?

10:35.930 --> 10:39.190
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

10:39.270 --> 10:40.530
But there was this girl.

10:40.670 --> 10:41.930
Girl?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.490
Was this
an Envy-related dream?

10:43.570 --> 10:45.160
We don't use
the E-word in this house.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.300
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

10:48.370 --> 10:50.370
Yay for that.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.640
Speaking of new,

10:51.710 --> 10:53.610
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

10:53.680 --> 10:55.270
to the library
a half-hour ago?

10:55.620 --> 10:57.850
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

11:00.950 --> 11:02.050
Shh!

11:02.420 --> 11:03.720
It's weird.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.350
What's weird?

11:05.430 --> 11:08.190
Libraries remind me
of grade school.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.700
That must seem like
a really long time ago.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.390
Yeah, let's talk
about something else.

11:32.690 --> 11:33.980
Do you know that girl?

11:35.560 --> 11:36.990
Scott!
What?

11:37.460 --> 11:39.860
You only played one note
for that entire song.

11:40.860 --> 11:41.950
My hand slipped.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.760
Is your girlfriend
distracting you?

11:43.900 --> 11:45.630
My girlfriend?

11:45.700 --> 11:47.030
I'll be quieter.

11:48.170 --> 11:49.400
Let's do that one again.

11:49.540 --> 11:50.760
Sorry, what are we doing?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.170
I told you, like, 50 times!

11:52.240 --> 11:54.070
We're going
to this party, retard.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.300
Party?
At Julie's.

11:56.380 --> 11:57.400
I thought
you guys split up.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.950
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

12:00.010 --> 12:01.910
Oh, man, this is gonna suck. Suck!

12:01.980 --> 12:04.140
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

12:04.220 --> 12:05.310
Oh, man!

12:05.390 --> 12:06.510
This sucks!

12:06.590 --> 12:07.680
Sucks!

12:07.750 --> 12:10.780
I'm gonna go pee
due to boredom.

12:11.890 --> 12:13.360
I have to pee.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.020
You know, so I told him
you've got a really good sound,

12:15.090 --> 12:16.560
and I think that you
should market your sound

12:16.630 --> 12:19.120
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

12:19.200 --> 12:20.190
Hey, Comeau.

12:20.270 --> 12:22.100
How about this party? You
getting your drink on here?

12:22.170 --> 12:24.000
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

12:24.070 --> 12:25.370
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

12:25.440 --> 12:27.800
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

12:27.870 --> 12:29.240
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

12:29.310 --> 12:31.370
Yeah, pretty much, I do.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.130
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

12:33.210 --> 12:34.650
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.710
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

12:36.780 --> 12:38.080
What?
Oh, Scott.

12:38.150 --> 12:40.280
You have the hots for her or
something? I gotta tell you though,

12:40.350 --> 12:41.790
I hear that she's
a little hardcore.

13:23.530 --> 13:24.830
Hey, what's up?

13:25.260 --> 13:26.250
Nothing.

13:26.330 --> 13:27.660
<i>Hey, you know Pac-Man?</i>

13:27.730 --> 13:29.220
I know of him.

13:29.500 --> 13:32.870
<i>Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.</i>

13:33.810 --> 13:35.470
They changed it because...

13:35.540 --> 13:37.670
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

13:37.740 --> 13:40.180
<i>"Paku-paku" means
"flap your mouth,"</i>

13:40.250 --> 13:42.810
and that they were afraid
people would change...

13:42.880 --> 13:46.680
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

13:48.890 --> 13:50.550
Yeah, that's amazing.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.110
Um...

13:53.330 --> 13:54.490
Am I dreaming?

13:57.060 --> 13:58.550
I'll leave you alone
forever now.

13:58.630 --> 13:59.690
Thanks.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.230
Dude!
What?

14:08.310 --> 14:09.570
She's totally real!
Who?

14:09.640 --> 14:11.200
Ramona Flowers.
What?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.340
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

14:13.410 --> 14:15.070
All I know is
that she is American.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.210
American.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.720
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

14:17.780 --> 14:18.840
They know a lot more.

14:18.920 --> 14:21.050
Lady-dudes. What do you
know about Ramona Flowers?

14:21.120 --> 14:22.420
I heard she has
a boyfriend.

14:22.490 --> 14:23.890
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

14:24.120 --> 14:25.680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

14:25.760 --> 14:28.190
I heard she kicks
all kinds of ass.

14:28.260 --> 14:30.790
She's on another level.

14:30.860 --> 14:32.760
She has men
dying at her feet.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.460
She's got some
battle scars, dude.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.060
What about Ramona Flowers?

14:37.140 --> 14:38.130
You know her?
Tell me now.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.190
She just moved here.

14:39.270 --> 14:40.830
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

14:40.910 --> 14:41.900
Does she really?

14:41.970 --> 14:43.640
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

14:43.710 --> 14:44.770
Did she really?

14:44.840 --> 14:46.110
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

14:46.180 --> 14:47.170
Did they really?

14:47.250 --> 14:49.650
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.680
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.950
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

14:54.020 --> 14:56.150
even if you haven't had a
real girlfriend in over a year.

14:57.320 --> 15:00.450
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

15:00.890 --> 15:02.490
He's totally dating
a high-schooler.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.530
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

15:04.600 --> 15:05.760
She's got a point.

15:05.830 --> 15:06.920
I thought
you guys broke up.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.760
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.400
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

15:12.470 --> 15:13.940
That's completely untrue.

15:14.010 --> 15:15.800
That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.810
That time with Hollie? That
wasn't what it looked like.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.940
That time you
dumped Kim for...

15:19.010 --> 15:20.770
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

15:22.550 --> 15:25.610
Whatever! Ramona's out of your
league. Let's just leave it at that.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.980
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

15:28.050 --> 15:30.220
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.760
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.150
Forget it, Scott!

15:36.830 --> 15:38.560
Guess who's drunk?

15:39.200 --> 15:40.860
I guess Wallace.

15:41.670 --> 15:42.730
You guess right.

15:46.410 --> 15:47.770
So, that girl
from my dream...

15:47.840 --> 15:49.140
Girl. Okay.

15:49.210 --> 15:50.640
I saw her at the library.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.340
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

15:53.410 --> 15:56.280
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

15:56.350 --> 15:57.610
Hey, there he is.

15:57.680 --> 15:58.670
I think she's...

15:58.750 --> 15:59.780
I think he's...

15:59.850 --> 16:02.010
I think she's
the girl of my dreams.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.080
Mmm.

16:03.260 --> 16:05.550
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.350
I've never been
so sure about something.

16:07.430 --> 16:09.920
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.290
What's that?

16:11.360 --> 16:14.330
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

16:14.400 --> 16:15.730
I'm not getting it, friend.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.730
You're thinking of
juggling two chicks?

16:18.800 --> 16:19.860
Not even!

16:19.940 --> 16:22.270
Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:22.340 --> 16:23.400
Wait, who told you?

16:23.480 --> 16:24.770
Wallace. Duh!

16:24.840 --> 16:26.570
He's not even conscious.
Whatever.

16:26.650 --> 16:29.580
You of all people should know
how sucky it is to get cheated on.

16:29.650 --> 16:30.810
Don't you have
a job to do?

16:30.880 --> 16:33.650
You're right. I should send
out a mass text about this. Bye.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.820
Wallace,
how do you do that?

16:38.890 --> 16:40.190
Wallace!

16:41.090 --> 16:43.120
Amazon. Ca,
what's the website for that?

16:43.530 --> 16:45.660
"Amazon. Ca.''

16:45.730 --> 16:48.030
I have to order
something really cool.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.760
<i>You've got mail.</i>

16:49.840 --> 16:51.230
Dude, this thing
claims I have mail.

16:51.540 --> 16:53.800
It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.

16:54.070 --> 16:55.340
Dude, now I'm reading it.

16:55.410 --> 16:56.770
So happy for you.

16:57.440 --> 16:59.410
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim, it
has come to my attention

16:59.480 --> 17:00.810
"that we will be
fighting soon.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.910
"My name is Matthew Patel,
and... ' ' Blah, blah, blah...

17:04.579 --> 17:09.150
<i>"Fair warning... Mano y mano...
Seven evil... ' ' Blah, blah.</i>

17:09.859 --> 17:15.020
This is...
This is... This is...

17:15.290 --> 17:16.450
What?

17:16.530 --> 17:18.430
This is boring.

17:18.859 --> 17:20.490
Delete.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.460
Scott,

17:26.410 --> 17:28.900
are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?

17:29.380 --> 17:30.600
Maybe.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.740
It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.250
You were saying?

17:36.380 --> 17:37.440
Attack hug!
Hey!

17:37.520 --> 17:40.580
Attack hug. That's so cute. So cute.

17:40.650 --> 17:41.640
You don't remember?

17:41.720 --> 17:44.320
You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.050
How could I
possibly forget?

17:48.730 --> 17:50.530
Yearbook club
is so boring.

17:50.600 --> 17:52.860
I cannot believe the music
they put on while we work.

17:52.930 --> 17:53.960
That's sucky.

17:54.030 --> 17:57.200
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.570
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

17:59.640 --> 18:00.660
I tell you.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.430
<i>Bad!</i>

18:04.210 --> 18:05.300
<i>Bad!</i>

18:05.980 --> 18:07.100
<i>Bad!</i>

18:08.310 --> 18:09.370
<i>Bad!</i>

18:10.150 --> 18:11.170
<i>Bad!</i>

18:11.250 --> 18:13.450
Okay. I'm sorry,
that was all me.

18:13.590 --> 18:14.850
<i>Solo round!</i>

18:15.720 --> 18:16.710
Uh-oh.

18:17.190 --> 18:18.320
Nega ninja.

18:18.390 --> 18:19.880
<i>Nega ninja!</i>

18:20.230 --> 18:21.280
I can never get
past that guy.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.350
Don't beat
yourself up about it.

18:24.430 --> 18:25.620
<i>Game over!</i>

18:25.700 --> 18:28.000
Do you want
to keep going?

18:28.070 --> 18:30.470
<i>Continue? Nine, eight,</i>

18:30.540 --> 18:33.600
<i>seven, six, five...
I think...</i>

18:33.670 --> 18:34.730
<i>...four, three...</i>

18:34.810 --> 18:36.140
I think that we should...

18:36.210 --> 18:38.140
<i>...two, one.</i>

18:45.580 --> 18:47.950
<i>Game on, everybody.
Game on.</i>

18:48.190 --> 18:49.350
<i>I got us a show.</i>

18:49.420 --> 18:50.680
Oh, my gosh, when?

18:50.820 --> 18:52.090
Wednesday.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.820
The Rockit. And even
better, it's the T.I.B.B.

18:54.890 --> 18:55.880
Whoa!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.490
The Toronto International
Battle of the Bands?

18:57.560 --> 18:58.550
That's right.

18:58.630 --> 19:01.190
This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"

19:01.270 --> 19:03.000
And I was like,
"I'm in a band.''

19:03.070 --> 19:04.730
And he was like,
"You're in a band?"

19:04.800 --> 19:07.140
And I was like, "Yeah,
I am totally in a band.''

19:07.210 --> 19:08.300
Great story, man.

19:08.370 --> 19:09.740
Is there a prize
or something?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.240
Only a record deal
with G-Man Graves.

19:12.950 --> 19:14.780
Who's that?
You don't know?

19:14.850 --> 19:16.640
Indie producer
of the millennium.

19:16.880 --> 19:17.870
Oh.

19:18.020 --> 19:22.750
If we win, it won't just be
Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

19:22.820 --> 19:25.420
It'll be the cool kids, too.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.520
I promise

19:26.590 --> 19:30.360
I will do everything I can to get
out of the study group and come.

19:31.260 --> 19:32.990
I have to pee.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.660
Oh, my gosh,
who are you battling?

19:35.270 --> 19:36.430
Crash and the Boys.

19:36.500 --> 19:39.230
That one band
with Crash, and those boys?

19:39.310 --> 19:40.470
Yeah, that's the one.

19:40.540 --> 19:41.700
I hate them.

19:41.770 --> 19:43.070
Oh, my gosh,
I hate them, too.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.170
Yeah, they suck.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.230
They suck bad.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.700
Hey!

20:23.080 --> 20:24.210
Hey!

20:29.020 --> 20:30.450
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

20:30.520 --> 20:32.150
Hi, I was thinking
about asking you out,

20:32.220 --> 20:33.990
but then I realized
how stupid that would be.

20:34.260 --> 20:35.590
So, do you want
to go out sometime?

20:36.400 --> 20:38.760
No, that's okay. You can
just sign for this, all right?

20:38.830 --> 20:40.800
I just woke up, and you were in my dream.

20:40.870 --> 20:43.700
I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?

20:43.940 --> 20:45.030
It's not weird at all.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.130
It's not?

20:46.210 --> 20:47.500
No, it's just that you
have this really convenient

20:47.570 --> 20:49.600
subspace highway running through
your head that I like to use.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.200
It's, like,
three miles in 15 seconds.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.270
Right, right.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.110
I forgot you guys
don't have that in Canada.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.400
You don't
remember me, do you?

20:55.480 --> 20:56.610
We met at the party
the other day.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.680
<i>Were you the Pac-Man guy?
No.</i>

20:58.750 --> 21:00.740
Not even.
That was some total ass.

21:00.950 --> 21:02.440
I was the other guy.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.750
You know, you need to sign
for this, whatever this is.

21:04.820 --> 21:05.980
But if I sign for it,
you'll leave.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.180
Yeah, it's how it works.

21:07.260 --> 21:09.190
Okay, well, maybe,

21:09.260 --> 21:12.060
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

21:12.130 --> 21:14.100
You're the new kid
on the block, right?

21:14.170 --> 21:19.400
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.340
You want me to
hang out with you?

21:23.980 --> 21:25.500
Yeah, if that's cool.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.850
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

21:30.380 --> 21:31.750
So, yeah, 8:00?

21:35.220 --> 21:36.850
Why are you just
standing there?

21:37.090 --> 21:39.020
Dude, I'm totally
waiting on you.

21:39.090 --> 21:41.580
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.490
Oh, you assumed wrong.

21:44.660 --> 21:46.890
So, how did you
end up in Toronto?

21:46.970 --> 21:48.300
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.770
Yeah.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.460
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

21:51.540 --> 21:54.030
Toronto was one of
the great cities, so...

21:54.110 --> 21:56.130
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

21:56.480 --> 21:59.210
He's a friend.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.970
Was he your boyfriend?

22:02.310 --> 22:04.510
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

22:04.580 --> 22:06.950
It's so not
interesting to me.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.790
So, what about you?
What do you do?

22:09.860 --> 22:11.880
I'm in between jobs
at the moment.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.050
Between what and what?

22:14.130 --> 22:19.220
Well, my last job was a
long story filled with sighs.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.430
I know plenty of those.

22:21.500 --> 22:22.760
Is that why you
left New York?

22:22.840 --> 22:24.430
Pretty much.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.530
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

22:27.070 --> 22:28.730
Well, it's certainly
chilled here.

22:28.810 --> 22:30.000
Yeah.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.410
It's chilled, as in cold.

22:32.680 --> 22:33.940
Yeah.

22:36.380 --> 22:39.410
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?

22:39.490 --> 22:40.580
I know.

22:40.650 --> 22:42.620
I can barely see you.

22:42.690 --> 22:45.380
This whole thing is
an unmitigated disaster.

22:45.460 --> 22:49.290
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.230
So this is a date, eh?

22:51.360 --> 22:53.260
Did I say date?

22:53.770 --> 22:55.260
Slip of the tongue.

22:55.330 --> 22:56.890
Tongue.

22:56.970 --> 22:59.490
Anyway,
night's not over yet.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.510
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

23:01.570 --> 23:02.600
A thingy?

23:03.580 --> 23:05.300
A door.

23:08.610 --> 23:09.840
Come on.

23:25.530 --> 23:26.790
What kind of tea
do you want?

23:27.100 --> 23:28.360
There's more
than one kind?

23:29.600 --> 23:32.130
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

23:32.200 --> 23:33.330
green tea,
green tea with lemon,

23:33.410 --> 23:34.930
green tea with lemon and
honey, liver disaster,

23:35.010 --> 23:36.340
ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

23:36.410 --> 23:38.380
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

23:38.440 --> 23:40.740
vanilla-walnut,
Constant Comment

23:41.080 --> 23:42.380
and Earl Grey.

23:42.780 --> 23:44.250
Did you make
some of those up?

23:44.850 --> 23:46.750
I think I'll have
Sleepytime.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.420
That sounds good to me.

23:50.590 --> 23:51.720
Let me get you a blanket.

23:52.090 --> 23:54.990
That would
actually be awesome.

24:05.670 --> 24:06.800
Dude, I'm changing.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.670
Sorry. I'm just cold.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.800
Here, does that help?

24:11.880 --> 24:14.540
Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

24:15.410 --> 24:17.310
Okay.

24:33.130 --> 24:36.530
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

24:36.600 --> 24:37.860
I guess.

24:37.940 --> 24:42.500
Maybe we should both get
under it, since we're so cold.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.830
What about our tea?

24:47.710 --> 24:49.110
I can

24:50.150 --> 24:51.910
not have tea.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.450
I changed my mind.

25:01.530 --> 25:04.160
Changed it to what?
From what?

25:04.230 --> 25:07.720
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

25:07.800 --> 25:09.630
Okay.

25:09.700 --> 25:12.000
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

25:12.070 --> 25:13.590
You can sleep in my bed.

25:13.670 --> 25:16.570
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

25:16.640 --> 25:20.240
Well, this is nice.
Just this.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.780
It's been, like,
a really long time,

25:22.850 --> 25:25.280
so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,

25:25.350 --> 25:27.440
so thank you.

25:29.350 --> 25:31.290
You're welcome.

25:34.260 --> 25:37.750
Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?

25:37.830 --> 25:40.530
For one thing, I didn't even
get any. That was a joke.

25:41.570 --> 25:42.730
What did you
have in mind?

25:43.370 --> 25:45.800
Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.

25:45.870 --> 25:47.100
You have a band?

25:47.170 --> 25:48.470
Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?

25:49.140 --> 25:50.440
Sure.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.710
Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?

25:55.280 --> 25:57.250
Wow. Girl number.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.810
See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.

26:00.320 --> 26:01.750
Hey, it's tonight. At the...

26:06.890 --> 26:09.490
Hey. You totally came.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.620
Yes. I did totally come.

26:17.870 --> 26:20.430
Please excuse my brother.
He is chronically enfeebled.

26:20.510 --> 26:21.940
I'm Stacey.
Hey.

26:22.010 --> 26:23.600
This is Wallace, his roommate. Hey.

26:23.680 --> 26:24.940
This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.

26:25.010 --> 26:26.000
Hey.

26:26.610 --> 26:28.100
Oh, and this is Knives.

26:28.180 --> 26:29.910
Hey!
Hey!

26:34.620 --> 26:36.210
So, do you like?

26:36.290 --> 26:38.280
Well, I...

26:48.770 --> 26:51.360
Have to go.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.930
<i>Okay, this next band
is from Brampton,</i>

26:57.010 --> 27:00.570
<i>and they are
Crash and the Boys.</i>

27:01.780 --> 27:03.710
God! This is a nightmare.

27:04.720 --> 27:07.050
Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

27:07.120 --> 27:08.520
Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.

27:08.590 --> 27:12.020
We were just on stage for sound
check, and the sound guy hated us.

27:12.090 --> 27:15.320
It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.

27:15.390 --> 27:16.550
People love us, right?

27:16.630 --> 27:17.890
Oh, man, this is bad.

27:18.430 --> 27:20.460
This is so, so bad.

27:20.730 --> 27:23.760
Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?

27:24.770 --> 27:27.330
They have not
started playing yet.

27:28.110 --> 27:29.970
<i>That was a test, Jimmy.
One, two.</i>

27:30.240 --> 27:31.610
You passed.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.110
Okay.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.440
<i>Good evening.</i>

27:34.510 --> 27:36.850
<i>My name is Crash.
These are the Boys.</i>

27:36.920 --> 27:38.610
Is that girl a boy, too?

27:38.680 --> 27:39.670
<i>Yes.</i>

27:41.250 --> 27:42.950
They have a girl drummer?

27:43.020 --> 27:47.580
<i>This song is called I Am So
Sad, I Am So Very Very Sad.</i>

27:47.660 --> 27:49.060
<i>Goes a little
something like this.</i>

27:51.830 --> 27:54.360
<i>So sad!</i>

27:55.670 --> 27:56.730
<i>Thank you.</i>

27:56.970 --> 27:59.200
It's not a race, guys.

27:59.270 --> 28:00.760
<i>All right, this next song
goes out to the guy</i>

28:00.840 --> 28:02.330
<i>who keeps yelling
from the balcony.</i>

28:02.470 --> 28:04.530
<i>It's called
We Hate You, Please Die.</i>

28:04.610 --> 28:06.470
Sweet. Love this one.

28:17.420 --> 28:19.120
<i>I can feel ya, I can hear ya...</i>

28:34.770 --> 28:35.900
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:37.110 --> 28:39.740
So, how do you know Scott?

28:40.780 --> 28:42.370
He's a friend.

28:43.350 --> 28:44.940
It's hard for me
to keep track sometimes,

28:45.020 --> 28:47.140
because he has
so many friends.

28:48.550 --> 28:51.850
Knives,
how did you meet Scott?

28:51.920 --> 28:53.150
Well...

28:53.930 --> 28:55.090
<i>Oh, no.</i>

28:57.200 --> 28:59.630
<i>This is a nightmare.</i>

29:02.200 --> 29:03.600
We need to play
now and loud.

29:03.670 --> 29:04.730
Okay.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.170
So, I was on the bus
with my mom...

29:10.110 --> 29:12.130
Is that seriously
the end of the story?

29:12.510 --> 29:13.640
Oh, my gosh!

29:13.710 --> 29:14.700
<i>Okay.</i>

29:14.780 --> 29:15.870
They're on!

29:15.950 --> 29:17.850
<i>This next band
is from Toronto.</i>

29:17.920 --> 29:23.480
<i>And, yeah.
Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

29:23.560 --> 29:25.420
I heart you,
Sex Bob-Omb!

29:28.090 --> 29:29.360
Scott, are you ready?

29:29.430 --> 29:30.900
Okay. Kim? Are you...

29:30.960 --> 29:34.660
We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!

29:42.540 --> 29:45.480
<i>I'll take you for a ride</i>

29:46.280 --> 29:48.640
<i>On my garbage truck</i>

29:50.850 --> 29:52.340
<i>Oh, no</i>

29:53.350 --> 29:55.650
<i>I'll take you to the dump</i>

29:57.560 --> 30:00.250
<i>'Cause you're my queen</i>

30:01.190 --> 30:03.680
<i>I'll take you uptown</i>

30:04.830 --> 30:08.790
<i>I'll show you the sites
You know you wanna ride</i>

30:10.040 --> 30:11.760
<i>On my garbage truck</i>

30:13.470 --> 30:14.960
<i>Truck, truck, truck</i>

30:15.510 --> 30:18.440
<i>We'll pass the mansions by</i>

30:18.510 --> 30:21.950
<i>Drive right through
the needle's eye</i>

30:22.010 --> 30:23.110
<i>Oh, my</i>

30:23.180 --> 30:24.270
<i>Oh, no... My...</i>

30:24.420 --> 30:26.480
<i>My, my, my, my</i>

30:29.720 --> 30:31.710
<i>I've got a stereo</i>

30:32.860 --> 30:35.850
<i>You've just got
to turn the knob</i>

30:35.930 --> 30:39.190
<i>And maybe we'll go</i>

30:39.260 --> 30:41.460
<i>As far as we can</i>

30:42.300 --> 30:44.530
<i>I'll be your garbage man</i>

30:46.070 --> 30:48.400
<i>I'll take out your junk</i>

30:49.610 --> 30:50.800
<i>And I'll crush it...</i>

30:52.910 --> 30:54.570
Mr. Pilgrim.

30:55.950 --> 30:59.750
It is I, Matthew Patel.

31:00.590 --> 31:03.450
Consider our fight begun.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.320
What did I do?

31:07.630 --> 31:09.650
What do I do?

31:11.430 --> 31:12.620
Fight!

31:25.210 --> 31:27.010
All right.

31:27.950 --> 31:30.140
All right.

31:30.220 --> 31:32.780
Watch out!
It's that one guy.

32:05.520 --> 32:07.140
Well, well, well,

32:08.220 --> 32:11.210
you're quite the opponent,
Pilgrim.

32:11.290 --> 32:12.760
Who the hell
are you, anyway?

32:12.820 --> 32:15.790
My name is Matthew Patel!

32:16.190 --> 32:21.600
And I'm Ramona's
first evil ex-boyfriend.

32:23.540 --> 32:24.520
Her what?

32:26.100 --> 32:27.570
Anyone need another drink?

32:39.050 --> 32:41.080
Wait. We're fighting
over Ramona?

32:41.920 --> 32:44.510
Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?

32:44.920 --> 32:45.950
I skimmed it.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.250
Mmm-mmm.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.790
You will pay for
your insolence!

33:14.290 --> 33:16.580
Hey, what's up
with his outfit?

33:17.120 --> 33:19.450
Yeah, is he a pirate?

33:20.260 --> 33:21.380
Are you a pirate?

33:21.460 --> 33:22.890
Pirates are in this year.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.760
You really went out
with this guy?

33:35.370 --> 33:36.670
Yeah.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.770
In the seventh grade.

33:40.910 --> 33:41.970
And?

33:45.280 --> 33:48.180
It was football season
and for some reason,

33:48.250 --> 33:49.910
all the little jocks
wanted me.

33:51.490 --> 33:54.650
<i>Matthew was the only
non-white, non-jock boy in town.</i>

33:54.730 --> 33:58.390
<i>So, the two of us joined
forces and we took 'em all down.</i>

33:58.460 --> 34:02.060
<i>We brawled and scrapped
and fought for hours.</i>

34:02.130 --> 34:04.290
<i>Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers.</i>

34:05.570 --> 34:07.060
We only kissed once.

34:07.140 --> 34:10.300
After a week and a half,
I told him to hit the showers.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.969
Dude, wait.
Mystical powers?

34:15.409 --> 34:18.909
You'll pay for this, Flowers.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.690
<i>If you want to fight me</i>

34:22.750 --> 34:23.810
What?

34:24.060 --> 34:26.620
<i>Ha! You're not the brightest</i>

34:27.230 --> 34:31.889
<i>You won't know what
hit you in the slightest</i>

34:37.100 --> 34:38.230
This guy's good.

34:38.300 --> 34:40.639
<i>Me and my fireballs</i>

34:41.639 --> 34:43.440
<i>My Demon Hipster Chicks</i>

34:43.739 --> 34:45.040
Tell him, Matty.
Tell him, Matty.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.280
<i>I'm talking the talk</i>

34:47.350 --> 34:50.370
<i>Because I know I'm slick</i>

34:50.449 --> 34:51.710
<i>S- L-ick</i>

34:52.719 --> 34:54.080
<i>Fireballs</i>

34:54.550 --> 34:56.520
<i>Take this sucker down</i>

34:59.560 --> 35:04.860
<i>Let us show him
what we're all about</i>

35:05.200 --> 35:07.100
That doesn't even rhyme.

35:10.300 --> 35:13.500
<i>This is impossible.
How can this be?</i>

35:13.570 --> 35:16.770
<i>Open your eyes,
maybe you'll see.</i>

35:19.210 --> 35:20.730
<i>K- O!</i>

35:28.920 --> 35:30.550
Sweet! Coins.

35:30.760 --> 35:32.420
God, is that allowed?

35:33.530 --> 35:36.150
Well, it was nice
meeting you.

35:36.230 --> 35:38.700
Tell your gay friends
I said bye.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.230
Gay friends?

35:41.470 --> 35:42.630
Wallace! Again?

35:43.130 --> 35:44.970
Get a room, guys!
Oh, my God!

35:45.770 --> 35:49.370
Oh, man, $2.40? That's not
even enough for the bus home.

35:49.440 --> 35:51.640
I'll lend you
the 35 cents.

35:51.710 --> 35:55.270
<i>Yeah, so, Sex Bob-Omb wins.</i>

35:57.220 --> 35:59.080
Sex Bob-Omb won?

36:06.260 --> 36:09.720
So, what was
all that all about?

36:11.860 --> 36:13.850
I guess

36:15.130 --> 36:18.130
if we're gonna date, you may
have to defeat my seven evil exes.

36:18.200 --> 36:19.470
You have seven
evil ex-boyfriends?

36:19.540 --> 36:20.730
Seven evil exes, yes.

36:20.810 --> 36:22.360
And I have to fight...
Defeat.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.930
Defeat your seven evil exes if
we're going to continue to date?

36:27.010 --> 36:28.070
Pretty much.

36:28.150 --> 36:32.850
So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?

36:35.190 --> 36:36.210
I guess.

36:36.290 --> 36:37.410
Does that mean
we can make out?

36:38.760 --> 36:39.750
Sure.

36:39.820 --> 36:40.950
Cool.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.250
Aw!

36:51.640 --> 36:52.900
Someone's happy.

36:52.970 --> 36:55.340
Well, someone got to
second base last night.

36:55.410 --> 36:58.670
And someone has
a second date tonight.

36:58.740 --> 37:00.300
Someone's lucky, then.

37:01.750 --> 37:03.580
You know when I say
"someone," I mean "me," right?

37:03.650 --> 37:05.050
I got to second base
last night.

37:06.450 --> 37:07.580
Maybe first-and-a-half.

37:10.120 --> 37:14.680
So, I invited Ramona over for
dinner tonight, so you can't be here.

37:14.760 --> 37:16.280
I don't want you
gaying up the place.

37:18.230 --> 37:19.960
Okay, Scott.

37:20.600 --> 37:22.690
But in return, I have
to issue an ultimatum.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.430
One of your
famous ultimatums?

37:24.500 --> 37:26.370
It may live in infamy.

37:27.370 --> 37:31.430
You have to break up with
Knives, that poor angel, today.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.670
But it's hard.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.220
If you don't, I'm going to
tell Ramona about Knives.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.310
I swear to God, Scott.

37:39.380 --> 37:40.440
What? You...

37:41.250 --> 37:42.280
Hi. Morning.

37:42.350 --> 37:44.010
Hey, Jimmy.
Double standard!

37:44.090 --> 37:45.520
I didn't make up
the gay rulebook.

37:45.590 --> 37:46.990
You got a problem with it...
Stop.

37:47.130 --> 37:48.560
Take it up with
Liberace's ghost.

37:48.630 --> 37:49.680
You're a monster.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.460
Give me the bacon,
and go do your dirt

37:51.530 --> 37:52.720
while I watch
the Lucas Lee marathon.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.990
Who's Lucas Lee?

37:54.100 --> 37:55.090
Oh!

37:55.870 --> 37:57.330
He was this
pretty good skater.

37:57.400 --> 37:58.800
Now he's this
pretty good actor.

37:58.870 --> 38:00.900
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.060
They make movies
in Toronto?

38:02.210 --> 38:03.300
Yes.

38:03.370 --> 38:04.930
I'm stalking him later.

38:05.010 --> 38:06.000
So, this Lucas Lee...

38:06.080 --> 38:08.140
Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.

38:11.150 --> 38:12.310
You suck.

38:12.380 --> 38:13.580
Out.

38:13.750 --> 38:14.810
Surprising no one.

38:14.890 --> 38:15.880
Out.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.920
<i>Now, you listen close,
and you listen hard, bucko.</i>

38:20.990 --> 38:23.430
<i>The next click you'll
hear is me hanging up.</i>

38:23.490 --> 38:27.760
<i>The one after that is
me pulling the trigger.</i>

38:31.440 --> 38:32.490
Hey, Knives.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.330
Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?

38:36.410 --> 38:41.640
<i>Are you wearing a tan jacket,
like, a spring jacket, and a hoodie?</i>

38:42.380 --> 38:44.310
<i>And a dorky hat?</i>

38:44.380 --> 38:46.480
It's not dorky.
Why are you psychic?

38:46.550 --> 38:47.610
Hey!

38:47.690 --> 38:48.910
Hey. Hey.

38:50.620 --> 38:51.750
Hey.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.050
Oh, my God.

38:55.130 --> 38:59.120
I can't believe TCAD's coming to
town. Will you take me to the show?

38:59.200 --> 39:01.500
Yeah, listen...

39:01.570 --> 39:05.020
Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.

39:05.370 --> 39:07.100
Like, Chinese food?

39:07.170 --> 39:09.940
To meet my parents.
It's my birthday dinner.

39:10.010 --> 39:12.570
I think that's
a really bad idea.

39:13.010 --> 39:15.500
No, it's okay. Why?

39:15.580 --> 39:17.170
I'm too old for you.

39:17.250 --> 39:20.510
No, you're not. My dad is
nine years older than my mom.

39:20.590 --> 39:23.780
Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?

39:23.920 --> 39:26.820
I don't care. I'm...

39:28.160 --> 39:29.560
I'm in...

39:35.970 --> 39:37.160
Uh...

39:37.870 --> 39:39.270
Listen,

39:40.540 --> 39:42.270
I was thinking

39:43.610 --> 39:46.940
we should break up
or whatever.

39:49.110 --> 39:50.170
Really?

39:50.550 --> 39:51.780
Yeah.

39:52.920 --> 39:54.850
It's not gonna work out.

39:57.620 --> 39:58.610
Oh.

40:28.250 --> 40:30.240
Where's Knives.
Not coming tonight?

40:30.320 --> 40:31.350
No, we broke up.

40:31.420 --> 40:34.020
<i>Hey, check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy II.</i>

40:39.430 --> 40:41.360
Scott, you are
the salt of the earth.

40:41.430 --> 40:42.460
Thanks.

40:43.030 --> 40:44.330
I meant scum
of the earth.

40:44.740 --> 40:45.760
Thanks.

40:45.840 --> 40:47.200
You broke up with Knives?

40:47.270 --> 40:49.070
Yeah, but don't worry.

40:49.140 --> 40:51.630
Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.

40:51.710 --> 40:52.730
New-new.

40:54.510 --> 40:59.250
Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.980
Whether they're old, new, or

41:01.050 --> 41:02.180
New-new.
New-new.

41:02.250 --> 41:04.590
We were lucky to
survive the last round.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.280
It's sudden death now, okay?

41:06.360 --> 41:07.550
Okay.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.570
That's for me. That's
for me. That's for me.

41:16.630 --> 41:19.300
Hey, you're here.

41:20.370 --> 41:22.100
Yes, like you said.

41:23.770 --> 41:24.800
You know your hair?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.900
I know of it.

41:25.980 --> 41:27.140
It's all blue.

41:27.210 --> 41:30.370
I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.

41:31.380 --> 41:32.850
So...

41:34.120 --> 41:35.550
How do you guys
all know each other?

41:36.620 --> 41:38.850
High school, I guess.

41:38.920 --> 41:40.220
What Neil said.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.480
I'm Neil.

41:41.560 --> 41:44.260
Believe it or not, I actually
dated Scott in high school.

41:44.530 --> 41:46.050
Got any embarrassing stories?

41:46.130 --> 41:47.760
Yeah, he's an idiot.

41:48.100 --> 41:49.830
Okay, bye.
See you guys tomorrow.

41:49.900 --> 41:50.930
What about rehearsal?

41:51.070 --> 41:52.090
Neil knows my parts.

41:54.170 --> 41:55.660
I'm Neil.

42:03.950 --> 42:04.940
You doing okay, there?

42:05.020 --> 42:06.640
Yeah, good, good, good.

42:09.890 --> 42:11.050
She changed her hair.

42:11.190 --> 42:12.380
So? It looks nice blue.

42:12.460 --> 42:13.890
Yeah, I know, but she
did it without even making

42:13.960 --> 42:15.080
a big deal of it
or anything.

42:15.160 --> 42:17.860
She's fickle. Impulsive. Spontaneous.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.560
God, what am I gonna do?

42:19.830 --> 42:23.790
Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.

42:23.870 --> 42:25.800
So, how's dinner
coming along?

42:25.870 --> 42:27.740
Yeah, good, good, good.

42:29.240 --> 42:32.300
Okay, well, I'm gonna
leave you lovebirds to it.

42:32.380 --> 42:36.010
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.100
Don't go!

42:37.180 --> 42:38.580
Will you man the hell up?

42:38.650 --> 42:40.050
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

42:40.120 --> 42:41.240
You think so?

42:41.320 --> 42:44.220
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

42:44.520 --> 42:45.580
If I strike out?

42:45.660 --> 42:46.990
Okay, when. See you in 60.

42:52.030 --> 42:53.500
This is actually
really good garlic bread.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.160
Garlic bread is
my favorite food.

42:55.230 --> 42:56.960
I could honestly
eat it for every meal.

42:57.240 --> 42:59.730
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

42:59.800 --> 43:00.860
You'd get fat.

43:01.010 --> 43:02.100
No, why would I get fat?

43:02.170 --> 43:03.230
Bread makes you fat.

43:03.310 --> 43:04.540
Bread makes you fat?

43:07.380 --> 43:08.610
I wrote a song about you.

43:08.710 --> 43:09.770
You did?

43:09.850 --> 43:10.940
Yeah, it goes like this.

43:11.620 --> 43:14.680
<i>Ramona</i>

43:18.190 --> 43:21.120
<i>Ramona</i>

43:22.830 --> 43:25.230
<i>On my mind</i>

43:26.430 --> 43:30.390
<i>Ramona</i>

43:35.840 --> 43:37.240
Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.

43:38.010 --> 43:39.100
Finished?

43:45.850 --> 43:47.320
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

43:47.390 --> 43:49.380
Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?

43:49.450 --> 43:50.440
What?

43:50.520 --> 43:51.780
No, sorry. I just...

43:52.160 --> 43:55.650
I got a bad haircut right
before me and my big ex broke up,

43:55.730 --> 43:58.250
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

43:58.330 --> 44:01.090
<i>Scott is acutely aware
that his last salon haircut took place</i>

44:01.170 --> 44:05.000
<i>exactly 431 days ago, three
hours before his big breakup.</i>

44:05.070 --> 44:07.260
<i>He's been cutting
his own hair ever since.</i>

44:07.340 --> 44:08.430
So long ago.

44:09.870 --> 44:11.140
Sounds like a bad time.

44:11.210 --> 44:13.040
Bad time? Not really.

44:13.110 --> 44:14.200
<i>It was.</i>

44:14.280 --> 44:15.510
It was a mutual thing.

44:15.580 --> 44:16.670
<i>It wasn't.</i>

44:16.750 --> 44:19.720
I mean, she told me it was mutual.

44:19.780 --> 44:22.180
<i>She dumped him.
It was brutal.</i>

44:22.250 --> 44:23.480
What was her name?

44:23.550 --> 44:24.850
She was Nat,
when I knew her,

44:24.920 --> 44:27.020
but she stopped
liking that name.

44:27.090 --> 44:28.750
Then she stopped liking me.

44:28.830 --> 44:30.730
Your hair is cute.
I like it long.

44:30.800 --> 44:32.590
But it would be cuter short, wouldn't it?

44:32.660 --> 44:34.530
What?
What?

44:35.230 --> 44:36.260
Why are you
wearing that hat?

44:36.330 --> 44:37.560
I thought we could go
for a walk.

44:39.300 --> 44:40.740
Tell me we didn't
come out here in the cold

44:40.810 --> 44:42.100
so you could cover
your hair with that hat.

44:42.170 --> 44:44.800
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

44:44.880 --> 44:49.870
Just putting one leg in front
of the other, like this. Walking.

44:49.950 --> 44:51.920
You seem
a little heightened.

44:52.680 --> 44:54.050
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

44:54.120 --> 44:56.710
I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

44:56.790 --> 44:58.310
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

44:58.390 --> 45:00.290
in which case
I do drugs all the time.

45:00.360 --> 45:01.380
Every drug.

45:02.160 --> 45:05.130
Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,

45:05.200 --> 45:07.930
things sort of seem
a little brighter.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.020
What is this place?

45:09.100 --> 45:10.620
It's a totally
awesome castle.

45:10.770 --> 45:12.330
They're shooting this movie here right now.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.030
<i>Okay, everybody, let's
do this. Lots to do, everyone.</i>

45:15.110 --> 45:16.100
Lots to do.

45:16.170 --> 45:17.940
Did you find the guy you were stalking?

45:18.010 --> 45:19.670
I think I'm about
to right now.

45:19.740 --> 45:21.340
Mr. Lee is traveling.

45:21.410 --> 45:22.440
Mr. Lee?

45:22.510 --> 45:23.840
Lucas Lee.

45:23.950 --> 45:24.940
Oh.

45:25.450 --> 45:26.440
Oh?

45:26.720 --> 45:28.150
<i>And roll sound.</i>

45:34.890 --> 45:37.260
I wanna have his
adopted babies.

45:38.460 --> 45:39.550
<i>Here we go.</i>

45:41.370 --> 45:43.090
<i>All right,
on your marks, everyone.</i>

45:43.170 --> 45:44.500
Oh, man, we got to go.

45:44.740 --> 45:45.860
What? Why?

45:45.940 --> 45:48.230
I used to date that clown.

45:48.310 --> 45:49.330
And...

45:49.410 --> 45:50.470
Action.

45:50.810 --> 45:52.400
Oh, my God.

45:52.480 --> 45:53.640
Hey.

45:54.380 --> 45:56.070
The only thing keeping me and her apart

45:56.150 --> 45:58.450
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.210
You dated a famous guy?

46:00.280 --> 46:01.980
In ninth grade.
We had drama.

46:02.050 --> 46:03.350
Actually,
it might have been math.

46:03.490 --> 46:04.820
I just remember there being a lot of drama.

46:04.890 --> 46:05.880
Hey!

46:05.960 --> 46:07.890
He was a snot-nosed little
brat. He just followed me around.

46:07.960 --> 46:10.690
He had snot in his nose?
But he's famous.

46:10.760 --> 46:13.290
Hey! I'm talking to you,
Scott Pilgrim.

46:13.360 --> 46:14.960
He's famous and
he talked to me.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.170
The only thing keeping me and her apart

46:17.230 --> 46:19.790
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.560
Can I have your... Can I
have your autograph, please?

46:26.010 --> 46:27.070
What's up?

46:27.140 --> 46:29.340
How's life?
He seems nice.

46:32.850 --> 46:34.180
Boom!

46:37.760 --> 46:39.750
<i>And that's a cut!</i>

46:40.660 --> 46:44.190
Scott, evil ex. Fight.

46:44.260 --> 46:46.920
<i>Let's get ready to go again,
please. Let's get ready to go again.</i>

46:47.000 --> 46:48.590
<i>Hey, hombre.</i>

46:49.630 --> 46:52.600
You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?

46:56.270 --> 46:58.740
Some competish you are.

47:00.310 --> 47:01.300
Hey!

47:02.250 --> 47:03.370
Hey!

47:04.550 --> 47:06.480
Hey, I'm not done with you.

47:06.550 --> 47:08.680
Oh!

47:10.090 --> 47:11.990
Looks like
you're seeing double.

47:13.990 --> 47:14.980
He's good, right?

47:15.330 --> 47:17.020
Sometimes I let him do
the wide shots

47:17.390 --> 47:20.690
when I feel like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.

47:25.770 --> 47:27.030
What can I say?

47:28.640 --> 47:30.630
I'm nothing without
my stunt team.

47:36.510 --> 47:39.480
Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.

47:39.550 --> 47:40.540
How does it...

48:14.920 --> 48:16.940
Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?

48:17.020 --> 48:18.850
No, I just ate.
Negative.

48:26.060 --> 48:28.220
That's actually hilarious.

48:28.830 --> 48:29.890
Ah.

48:29.970 --> 48:31.400
Hilarious.

48:32.640 --> 48:34.190
Mr. Lee!

48:38.980 --> 48:40.880
You're needed back on set.

49:08.410 --> 49:09.900
Prepare...

49:10.740 --> 49:14.770
Prepare to feel the wrath
of the League of Evil Exes.

49:14.980 --> 49:16.570
The League of Evil Axes?

49:17.180 --> 49:18.480
You really don't know
about the League?

49:19.880 --> 49:22.910
The seven evil exes?
Coming to kill you?

49:23.450 --> 49:26.320
Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?

49:26.390 --> 49:27.550
No.

49:27.630 --> 49:29.290
Oh, well, hey, listen, man.
Don't worry about it.

49:29.690 --> 49:31.250
Really?
Yeah. Let's go get a beer.

49:31.330 --> 49:32.320
That's great...

49:32.400 --> 49:33.730
Boom!

49:37.330 --> 49:39.030
You are a pretty
good actor.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.430
I'm going for
the Oscar this year.

49:41.710 --> 49:43.670
But are you
a pretty good skater?

49:43.740 --> 49:45.900
<i>I'm more than
pretty good, ese.</i>

49:46.140 --> 49:48.010
I have my own skate company.

49:48.580 --> 49:52.540
But can you do
a thingy on that rail?

49:55.050 --> 49:56.820
It's called a grind, bro.

49:56.890 --> 50:00.720
So, can you do
a grindy thingy now?

50:02.360 --> 50:04.160
Are you serious?

50:06.400 --> 50:08.990
There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.

50:09.070 --> 50:11.190
Well, hey,
if it's too hardcore then...

50:11.840 --> 50:15.240
You really think you can goad
me into doing a trick like that?

50:15.310 --> 50:16.770
There are girls watching.

50:19.540 --> 50:21.770
Somebody get me my board.

50:23.050 --> 50:25.170
Hi. Big fan.

50:26.750 --> 50:28.380
Why wouldn't you be?

50:43.430 --> 50:44.420
Wow.

50:47.340 --> 50:48.330
Wow.

50:50.670 --> 50:51.660
Wow.

50:57.820 --> 50:58.800
Wow.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.610
Yes!
He totally bailed.

51:01.890 --> 51:03.220
Ah! I didn't get
his autograph.

51:03.290 --> 51:04.350
No.

51:04.420 --> 51:06.690
<i>And that's
a wrap, everybody.</i>

51:06.760 --> 51:09.620
Hey, where's Ramona.
Is she still here?

51:09.690 --> 51:11.990
No. She totally bailed.

51:12.060 --> 51:14.590
What's the deal? Seriously.

51:14.670 --> 51:16.600
<i>Let's move, people,
the sun is coming up.</i>

51:18.340 --> 51:22.830
Hey, it's me again. Scott. Give
me a call when you get this.

51:22.910 --> 51:24.640
Scott Pilgrim.

51:25.710 --> 51:28.140
What's the deal?
Seriously.

51:28.210 --> 51:30.480
Yep. You said that
last night.

51:30.550 --> 51:31.780
You know what
really sucks, though?

51:32.280 --> 51:33.270
What?

51:34.080 --> 51:35.350
Everything.

51:35.590 --> 51:37.050
Come on, guy.

51:37.590 --> 51:39.450
You can't say you didn't see this coming.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.550
What?

51:42.630 --> 51:44.030
What did you
think these were?

51:44.630 --> 51:47.600
Kisses?
Seven little kisses?

51:47.660 --> 51:50.720
Seven deadly X's.

51:53.940 --> 51:56.670
Why does everything
have to be so complicated?

51:57.780 --> 51:59.970
If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.

52:00.380 --> 52:01.740
Step up your game, Scott.

52:01.980 --> 52:03.310
Break out the L-word.

52:03.380 --> 52:04.570
"Lesbian?"

52:04.880 --> 52:06.040
The other L-word.

52:06.980 --> 52:08.350
"Lesbians?"

52:08.420 --> 52:11.080
It's "love," Scott. I
wasn't trying to trick you.

52:11.160 --> 52:13.390
Hey, buddy, look,

52:13.720 --> 52:16.750
if she really is
the girl of your dreams,

52:16.830 --> 52:18.290
then you have to
let her know.

52:18.360 --> 52:22.030
You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.

52:22.330 --> 52:25.200
You can do it. Be with her!
It's your destiny!

52:26.270 --> 52:28.240
Plus, I need you
to move out.

52:28.310 --> 52:29.400
What?
Yeah.

52:29.470 --> 52:30.800
I'm kind of banking
on her calling you back

52:30.870 --> 52:33.210
so I don't have to evict you
and feel all guilty and shit.

52:34.380 --> 52:35.710
I have a feeling
that's for you, guy.

52:37.350 --> 52:38.340
Hey.

52:38.450 --> 52:39.470
<i>Hey, Scott.</i>

52:39.550 --> 52:41.350
Envy?
Oh, shit.

52:42.050 --> 52:43.180
Been a while.

52:43.250 --> 52:44.240
Yeah.

52:44.320 --> 52:45.520
A year, I think.

52:45.590 --> 52:46.920
Approximately.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.250
How are you?

52:48.330 --> 52:49.720
I'm not doing
so good right now.

52:50.130 --> 52:54.220
Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?

52:54.300 --> 52:58.330
What? No. I've been... It's
been different. You have no idea.

52:58.400 --> 53:00.960
<i>Probably not. Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

53:01.040 --> 53:03.060
<i>Should I be jealous?</i>

53:03.140 --> 53:05.400
Yes, you should. I have this
totally awesome girlfriend

53:05.480 --> 53:08.040
who calls me all the
time and she's America.

53:08.110 --> 53:09.140
She's American.

53:09.210 --> 53:10.370
What's her name?

53:10.450 --> 53:12.180
I'm not telling you that.
Ramona.

53:12.250 --> 53:13.240
Oh.

53:13.580 --> 53:14.610
What? Do you know her?

53:14.690 --> 53:16.080
What? No.

53:16.550 --> 53:17.990
It sounded like you did.

53:18.060 --> 53:20.620
I got to go. It's been
nice chatting with you.

53:20.690 --> 53:21.820
Wait.

53:27.630 --> 53:28.860
Okay.

53:31.270 --> 53:32.390
Everything does suck.

53:32.570 --> 53:35.200
Or does it? Hello?

53:36.040 --> 53:37.130
Hey, Knives.

53:38.540 --> 53:40.770
What's that?
You're outside?

53:41.880 --> 53:43.350
Is Scott here?

53:43.410 --> 53:46.040
You know what? He just
left.

53:47.990 --> 53:48.970
Really?

53:49.120 --> 53:50.140
Yeah.

53:52.290 --> 53:53.450
Sorry.

53:56.530 --> 53:57.820
<i>Do you have a girlfriend?</i>

53:57.900 --> 54:00.920
<i>Seven deadly X's.</i>

54:01.230 --> 54:03.630
<i>You may have to
defeat my seven evil exes.</i>

54:04.800 --> 54:06.930
<i>It's sudden death now, okay?</i>

54:07.070 --> 54:09.270
<i>She's got some
battle scars, dude.</i>

54:09.340 --> 54:11.200
<i>You can't say you
didn't see this coming.</i>

54:14.240 --> 54:15.440
Dude.

54:18.550 --> 54:19.570
Please.

54:20.550 --> 54:22.180
I'm really not
in the mood for this.

54:24.590 --> 54:25.820
Okay, enough!

54:32.700 --> 54:34.130
You punched me
in the boob!

54:35.700 --> 54:37.790
Prepare to die, obviously.

54:37.870 --> 54:40.130
Look, I've had it today.
Can we not do this right now?

54:40.200 --> 54:42.300
I'd love to
postpone, darling,

54:42.370 --> 54:44.670
but I just cashed
my last rain check.

54:45.010 --> 54:46.370
What's that from?
My brain!

54:47.240 --> 54:49.970
I'm really, really not up
for this. Whatever it is.

54:50.050 --> 54:53.510
Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.

54:53.580 --> 54:55.280
But you won't see me,

54:55.350 --> 54:58.980
because next time, I'll be
deadly serious next time.

54:59.320 --> 55:00.310
What?

55:00.390 --> 55:01.520
Never mind!

55:03.130 --> 55:05.290
Man. Someone help me.

55:06.530 --> 55:07.860
<i>Hello.
It's Scott.</i>

55:07.930 --> 55:09.130
What did he do this time?

55:09.200 --> 55:10.760
No, it's Scott.
It's actually me.

55:10.830 --> 55:11.890
What did you do this time?

55:11.970 --> 55:13.630
I didn't do anything. It's
everyone else that's crazy.

55:13.700 --> 55:15.730
Look, I'm having a meltdown or
whatever. Are you still working?

55:15.810 --> 55:16.930
I'm literally
about to leave.

55:17.010 --> 55:18.170
Cool, I'm coming in.

55:24.650 --> 55:26.140
I think I'll make it
a decaf today.

55:26.220 --> 55:27.480
Scott Pilgrim!

55:27.990 --> 55:29.280
What did you do
with my sister?

55:30.450 --> 55:32.320
Sorry, I had to go.

55:32.860 --> 55:34.650
So, what can I
Get you?

55:34.730 --> 55:35.990
Is there anywhere
you don't work?

55:36.060 --> 55:39.190
They're called jobs. Something a
like you wouldn't know anything about.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.490
And by the way, I can't
believe you asked Ramona out

55:41.570 --> 55:44.130
after I specifically told
you not to do that.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.570
How are you doing
that with your mouth?

55:45.640 --> 55:47.690
Never mind
how I'm doing it!

55:47.770 --> 55:49.140
What do you have to say
for yourself?

55:49.470 --> 55:50.940
Can I get
a caramel macchiato?

55:51.940 --> 55:54.500
You know what, maybe it's high
time you took a look in a mirror

55:54.580 --> 55:56.270
before you wreak
havoc on another girl.

55:56.350 --> 55:57.470
Me? Wreak havoc?

55:57.550 --> 55:58.740
And speaking of
which,

55:58.820 --> 55:59.980
I hear the girl that
kicked your heart in the ass

56:00.050 --> 56:01.640
is walking the streets
of Toronto again.

56:03.020 --> 56:04.580
So, I can just get
my coffee over here?

56:07.820 --> 56:09.260
Sorry that got
a little crazy last night.

56:09.660 --> 56:11.590
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

56:12.330 --> 56:14.490
Yeah, I do that.

56:16.070 --> 56:19.590
Listen, I know I can be
hard to be around sometimes.

56:20.100 --> 56:22.300
I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.

56:22.370 --> 56:24.400
No, no, I want to hang.

56:24.810 --> 56:26.610
You know, the whole
evil ex-boyfriend thing...

56:26.680 --> 56:27.700
Exes.

56:27.780 --> 56:28.770
It's no biggie.

56:29.410 --> 56:31.940
I know it's early,

56:32.020 --> 56:34.480
but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...

56:34.550 --> 56:35.640
Shit!

56:37.020 --> 56:38.150
It's my ex.

56:38.220 --> 56:39.450
A big one?
Mmm-hmm.

56:40.260 --> 56:41.590
Envy.

56:44.360 --> 56:45.520
I'm gonna...

56:46.800 --> 56:48.200
Excuse me.

56:50.700 --> 56:51.760
Your hair is
getting shaggy.

56:51.840 --> 56:52.860
Yeah?

56:52.940 --> 56:54.490
So, that's Ramona.

56:54.570 --> 56:55.600
Yeah.

56:55.870 --> 56:57.310
Okay, I'm jealous.

56:57.370 --> 56:58.400
You're jealous?

56:58.640 --> 56:59.700
I'm allowed.

56:59.910 --> 57:02.110
You left me for
that cocky pretty boy.

57:02.180 --> 57:03.870
You haven't even
seen him.

57:04.080 --> 57:06.280
I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.

57:06.350 --> 57:09.180
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

57:09.250 --> 57:12.090
You should
so totally come.

57:12.160 --> 57:14.680
That's so not
going to happen.

57:14.760 --> 57:16.660
Great, you're
so on the list.

57:18.600 --> 57:21.960
Caramel macchiato
for Pilgrim.

57:22.670 --> 57:24.100
So, that was Envy.

57:24.170 --> 57:25.190
Uh-huh.

57:25.340 --> 57:26.800
What happened
with the two of you?

57:26.870 --> 57:28.840
Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

57:28.910 --> 57:30.400
She wanted to move
to Montreal,

57:30.470 --> 57:31.910
because she missed
her best friend.

57:32.340 --> 57:33.780
This guy, Todd.

57:33.840 --> 57:35.840
And two weeks later, they were
sleeping together, I guess?

57:35.910 --> 57:37.500
Basically.

57:37.580 --> 57:40.740
Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.

57:40.820 --> 57:44.550
I can see how it sucks. Having
the past come back to haunt you.

57:44.920 --> 57:47.360
Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

57:47.420 --> 57:48.950
What do you want
to think about?

57:49.260 --> 57:51.350
How warm
my place is right now.

57:51.430 --> 57:52.420
Oh.

57:53.830 --> 57:56.590
And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?

57:56.900 --> 57:59.430
I couldn't stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

57:59.500 --> 58:00.970
Is that
the Uma Thurman movie?

58:01.040 --> 58:05.370
Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

58:05.440 --> 58:07.500
Double negative.
It's tricky.

58:07.580 --> 58:09.480
It's over. Move on.

58:09.550 --> 58:10.540
Word.

58:10.610 --> 58:13.310
Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

58:13.620 --> 58:15.680
From this moment on,

58:15.750 --> 58:18.520
I will think of
Envy Adams no more!

58:19.920 --> 58:21.120
I have distressing news.

58:21.190 --> 58:24.160
Is it news that we suck, because
I really don't think I can take it.

58:24.230 --> 58:27.250
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

58:27.330 --> 58:29.420
and Envy asked us
to open for them.

58:29.500 --> 58:30.560
I hate you.

58:30.630 --> 58:32.800
A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.

58:32.870 --> 58:34.270
Maybe you can put
your history aside

58:34.340 --> 58:36.170
until we get through
this thing, for the band.

58:36.510 --> 58:38.240
For the band?
For the band?

58:38.310 --> 58:39.670
Can't we do our...
For the band?

58:39.740 --> 58:40.900
Can't we do our
own secret shows?

58:40.980 --> 58:42.670
All our shows
are secret shows.

58:42.950 --> 58:45.920
We're doing it.
G- Man might be there.

58:45.980 --> 58:47.880
We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.

58:47.950 --> 58:51.320
We have to get some buzz
going. We need groundswell.

58:51.390 --> 58:52.910
We need stalkers.

59:00.230 --> 59:01.820
What would you do
if your ex was in a band

59:01.900 --> 59:03.590
and they wanted you
to open for them?

59:03.800 --> 59:05.500
If my ex was in a band?

59:05.570 --> 59:06.560
Mmm-hmm.

59:07.170 --> 59:08.660
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

59:08.740 --> 59:10.400
it's the grown-up
thing to do.

59:10.710 --> 59:13.340
Yeah. We're all
adults here, right?

59:14.950 --> 59:16.640
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

59:16.950 --> 59:18.710
He's dating
a fat-ass hipster chick!

59:18.780 --> 59:20.310
I hate her stupid guts!

59:20.680 --> 59:25.620
He only likes her because she's
old. She's probably, like, 25!

59:25.960 --> 59:28.320
She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

59:28.390 --> 59:30.330
I think you mentioned
she was fat.

59:30.390 --> 59:31.720
She's got a head start.

59:31.800 --> 59:35.200
I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!

59:35.270 --> 59:36.320
Hey, this really burns.

59:36.400 --> 59:37.420
You should rinse.

59:38.640 --> 59:41.160
When I got this idea, I just
thought, "I have to do it!"

59:41.240 --> 59:43.070
I can't hear
anything you're saying.

59:43.870 --> 59:46.030
Oh, God! I look so

59:47.740 --> 59:49.370
good.

59:49.950 --> 59:52.310
Ramona Flowers
stole my Scott.

59:52.650 --> 59:55.450
But I know
how to get him back.

59:55.950 --> 59:56.980
How?

01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:10.760
<i>Come on, come on</i>

01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.670
<i>Thank you,
we were Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:19.210
Yeah!

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:21.470
<i>We have some merch
at the back, so...</i>

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.540
Okay, bar? Now?

01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:31.480
Level with me.
Did we suck?

01:00:31.550 --> 01:00:33.680
I don't know. Did you?

01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:38.120
She has to go.
She knows we suck.

01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:43.760
Hey, Ramona.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:47.030
Hey.

01:00:48.370 --> 01:00:50.000
What the hell?

01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:00.310
Hey.

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.780
Hey, Scott.

01:01:01.850 --> 01:01:03.980
What the hell?

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:05.820
Look who Knives is
hanging out with.

01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:07.620
Who is
that girl again?

01:01:07.690 --> 01:01:08.680
Scott dated her.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:09.820
Briefly, briefly.

01:01:10.290 --> 01:01:11.520
How old is she?

01:01:16.030 --> 01:01:17.260
I gotta pee on her.

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:20.200
I mean, I gotta pee.
Pee time.

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:25.140
<i>And then it was time</i>

01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:28.910
<i>for Toronto to drown
in the sweet sorrow</i>

01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.110
<i>of The Clash at Demonhead!</i>

01:01:36.990 --> 01:01:39.320
Envy! Envy!

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:43.060
That guy on bass...

01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:44.390
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:01:44.460 --> 01:01:45.790
...that's Todd.

01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.950
I know.

01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:48.520
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

01:01:49.530 --> 01:01:50.730
You know?

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.030
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:55.300
Oh, no.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.370
<i>Hello, again,
friend of a friend</i>

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.270
<i>I knew you well</i>

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.250
<i>Our common goal</i>

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.810
<i>was waiting for
the world to end</i>

01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:13.020
<i>Now that the truth</i>

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:17.620
<i>is just a rule
that you demand</i>

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.630
<i>You crack the whip</i>

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.960
<i>Shape-shift and trick
the past again</i>

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:29.330
<i>Send you my love on the wire</i>

01:02:29.410 --> 01:02:32.740
<i>Lift you up, every time</i>

01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:35.470
<i>Everyone</i>

01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.580
<i>pulls away</i>

01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:43.350
<i>from you</i>

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:46.190
That was...
That was devastating.

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.220
Oh, my God.
Just, oh, my God.

01:02:48.290 --> 01:02:51.320
Yeah, you should see them
live. They're much better live.

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:52.620
I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.560
I can't even believe
I'm saying this,

01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:59.400
but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.

01:02:59.470 --> 01:03:00.830
All of us?

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:02.370
Did I stutter?

01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.170
Wait, how do you know Envy?

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.340
Scott dated her.

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:15.680
Hey, Ramona.

01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.780
Hey, Todd.

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:19.810
It's been awhile.

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:21.280
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:21.790 --> 01:03:22.780
Mmm-hmm?

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:24.920
I think we should
get out of here.

01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:26.960
So, how was the tour? You
guys play with the Pixies?

01:03:27.030 --> 01:03:28.550
You're like a superstar now.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:31.330
Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.430
Um, Envy...

01:03:33.670 --> 01:03:35.140
I read your blog.

01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:38.500
So, Scott and Ramona, eh?

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:39.670
What of it?

01:03:39.740 --> 01:03:40.870
You guys make a cute couple, you know?

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.240
Suit each other.

01:03:43.310 --> 01:03:45.580
You're my role model, Envy.

01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:47.880
Ramona, I like your outfit.
Affordable?

01:03:47.950 --> 01:03:49.940
Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:52.210
I'm talking to
Ramona right now.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:53.710
Ramona lived in New York.

01:03:53.860 --> 01:03:54.880
Did she?

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:58.360
I was just there. Played the
Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.950
You know him, right?

01:04:01.330 --> 01:04:03.030
I've kissed the lips
that kissed you!

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.070
Knives!

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.030
What?

01:04:11.110 --> 01:04:12.300
I'm not afraid
to hit a girl.

01:04:14.210 --> 01:04:15.770
I'm a rock star.

01:04:15.850 --> 01:04:17.010
Oh, my God!

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:20.380
You punched the highlights
out of her hair.

01:04:22.090 --> 01:04:24.610
He punched the highlights
out of her hair!

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:26.750
You are incorrigible.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.920
I don't know
the meaning of the word.

01:04:30.890 --> 01:04:35.630
So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.570
Fun? In Toronto?

01:04:39.200 --> 01:04:41.900
That's it! You cocky cock!

01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.600
You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.250
My neck.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:00.550
Your hair.

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.990
Didn't you know?

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:04.450
Todd's vegan.

01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:11.220
Vegan?

01:05:12.770 --> 01:05:14.600
It's not really
that big of a deal.

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:17.640
No kidding.

01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.130
Anyone can be vegan.

01:05:21.980 --> 01:05:24.070
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:25.370
Ovo-what?

01:05:25.980 --> 01:05:30.210
I partake not in the meat, nor
the breast milk, nor the ovum

01:05:30.290 --> 01:05:32.380
of any creature with a face.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.650
Short answer,

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:36.210
being vegan just makes you
better than most people.

01:05:36.290 --> 01:05:37.350
Bingo.

01:05:40.830 --> 01:05:42.300
Hey, man, question.

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.170
I always wondered, how does
not eating dairy products

01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:47.070
give you psychic powers?

01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:48.630
Okay.

01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:51.110
You know how you only use
10% of your brain?

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:53.470
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

01:05:53.540 --> 01:05:55.670
Did you learn that
at Vegan Academy?

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.180
Go ahead and
get snippy, baby.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:59.680
If you knew the science, maybe
I'd listen to a word you're saying.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.280
If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.420
It's not raining.

01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:09.480
Oh.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.390
Then why don't you
give me the Cliff Notes

01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:14.090
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:15.490
Is that really
important right now?

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:17.530
Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.870
that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:25.970
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:30.270
<i>Guess that's not very nice, but
I used to be, kind of like that.</i>

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:34.380
<i>We hated everyone. We
wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.</i>

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.610
<i>He punched a hole
in the moon for me.</i>

01:06:36.690 --> 01:06:38.550
<i>It was pretty crazy.</i>

01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.820
<i>A week and a half later
he told me</i>

01:06:39.890 --> 01:06:41.690
<i>his dad was sending him
to Vegan Academy,</i>

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.790
<i>so I dumped him.</i>

01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:46.660
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

01:06:46.730 --> 01:06:48.590
You've never been
the dumpee?

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:51.790
Look, I've dabbled
in being a bitch.

01:06:51.870 --> 01:06:53.670
It's part of the reason
I moved here.

01:06:53.740 --> 01:06:57.040
I was really hoping to
just leave it all behind me.

01:06:57.110 --> 01:06:58.510
Hey, lovebirds...

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:01.810
We have unfinished business,
I and he.

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:03.710
He and me.

01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.270
Don't you talk to me
about grammar.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:07.250
<i>I dislike you, capisce?</i>

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.050
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.210
What?

01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:11.780
Because you'll be dust
by Monday.

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:13.510
Um...

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:15.650
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

01:07:15.730 --> 01:07:18.960
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.120
She dusts.

01:07:23.330 --> 01:07:24.730
So, what's on Monday?

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:29.900
Because it's Friday now. She
has the weekends off, so...

01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:32.440
Monday. Right?

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:34.470
Basically, you can't
win this fight.

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.700
You're gonna have
to give up this girl,

01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:37.110
because Todd's
gonna kill you.

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:39.410
You used to be so nice!

01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:54.690
Scott, we're gonna go
to Pizza Pizza for a slice.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.200
Call us when you're done.

01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:58.860
He'll be done.
Real soon.

01:08:02.270 --> 01:08:05.500
Sounds like someone
wants to get funky.

01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.750
I can read your thoughts. Your
will is broken. You're through.

01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.130
What say we drink
to my memory?

01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.160
Fair trade blend
with soy milk?

01:09:37.729 --> 01:09:39.670
I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.760
Dude, I can see
in your mind's eye.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.970
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.270
in an attempt to
make me break vegan edge.

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:48.140
I'll take the one with soy.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:52.779
Thanks, tool.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.380
<i>Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.</i>

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:00.290
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.260
You know, in my mind's eye or whatever.

01:10:04.330 --> 01:10:05.820
What are you talking about?

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.330
You just drank
half-and-half, baby.

01:10:09.170 --> 01:10:10.460
Freeze! Vegan police!

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:11.730
Vegan police!

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:15.330
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.640
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

01:10:19.210 --> 01:10:20.300
That's bullroar!

01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:22.310
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

01:10:22.380 --> 01:10:24.540
But it's only
my first offense.

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:25.770
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:27.210
Take it.

01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.750
At 12:27 a.m.
On February 1st,

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.120
you knowingly
ingested gelato.

01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:34.120
Gelato isn't vegan?

01:10:34.190 --> 01:10:35.620
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:38.820
On April 4th, 7:30 p.m. You
partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.660
Chicken isn't vegan?

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.360
The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.970
Oh, my God!

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:04.580
No. No.

01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:08.060
You once were a vegone,

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.320
but now you will be gone.

01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:11.650
Vegone?

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:28.770
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.710
Sorry, I guess.

01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.720
Sorry?

01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:43.250
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:47.920
You kicked my heart in the
ass, so I guess we're even.

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.890
Natalie.

01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:56.070
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:58.870
Maybe they should.

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.610
Let's get out of here.

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:14.090
For the record, I am so
pissed off for you, right now.

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.990
Shut the up, Julie.

01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:17.360
Okay.

01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:20.220
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.090
I'm not sure there's
going to be much of a party.

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.830
I think a third of the band
just went "poom.''

01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:26.560
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:29.400
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.440
Then why would we... Oh.

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:33.600
Neil, you down?

01:12:33.680 --> 01:12:34.970
Scott, you're in, right?

01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:37.100
You wanna go?

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:40.480
Well, I kind of
almost died back there.

01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:41.610
I'm not saying
I want to go.

01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:42.810
Yeah. We can totally go.

01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:43.910
I'll do whatever
you want to do.

01:12:43.990 --> 01:12:44.980
So, let's go.

01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.950
We really don't
have to go to this thing.

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:49.820
It'll probably be
a bad scene all around.

01:12:49.890 --> 01:12:52.420
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:53.930
It's just...
Well...

01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.220
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

01:12:58.300 --> 01:13:00.030
So far,
you're not a total ass.

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:01.300
But I'm part ass?

01:13:01.370 --> 01:13:03.500
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:04.600
Wait, is that good?

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.830
It's what I need right now.

01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:06.930
But not later?

01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:08.840
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

01:13:08.910 --> 01:13:11.640
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

01:13:11.710 --> 01:13:13.310
I'd just like to live.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:15.220
Look, I know
Todd was bad news,

01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:16.720
but are you saying
Envy wasn't?

01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:18.150
We all have baggage.

01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:21.280
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:23.220
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:24.620
Exes.
Whatever.

01:13:24.690 --> 01:13:26.850
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:29.490
What about you and that girl,
Knives? Who broke up with who?

01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:32.160
I believe
I broke up with her.

01:13:32.230 --> 01:13:33.530
And was she cool with that?

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.090
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.160
You sure about that?

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:38.800
Yeah, she's very mature
for her age.

01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:40.140
We had a very
healthy breakup.

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:41.400
We're all peaches and gravy.

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:42.770
No!

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:44.440
What about you and Kim?

01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:46.670
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:48.740
It was high school.
She had freckles.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:50.010
That's it?

01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:53.080
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.280
That's really
the whole story?

01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:56.220
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

01:13:56.290 --> 01:13:58.920
I fought a crazy,
80-foot-tall, purple-suited dude

01:13:58.990 --> 01:14:01.120
and I had to fight
96 guys to get to him.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.830
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.330
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.840
Does that make
you feel any better?

01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:11.700
Well, now you are being a
total ass. Welcome to the club.

01:14:12.510 --> 01:14:14.740
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.340
Hey, don't worry. I don't even
know what I'm like anymore.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:22.050
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.520
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:32.720
<i>The girl from earlier?</i>

01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:35.300
Roxy?
You know this girl?

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:38.390
Boy, does she know me.

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.800
What is she talking about?

01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.600
He really doesn't know?

01:14:44.010 --> 01:14:45.030
Wait.

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:46.930
Hmm?

01:14:49.850 --> 01:14:51.810
You and her?
It was just a phase.

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.540
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:55.110
It meant nothing. I didn't
think it would count.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:56.240
It meant nothing?

01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:57.550
I was just
a little bi-curious.

01:14:57.620 --> 01:14:59.180
Well, honey,

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.120
I'm a little bi-furious.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.900
Do that again
and I will end you.

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:17.440
Back off, hasbian.

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.410
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.

01:15:22.140 --> 01:15:24.170
The League has spoken.

01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:27.380
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

01:15:27.450 --> 01:15:30.080
because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:45.830
Wallace?
Uh-huh?

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.990
This is happening, right?
Oh, yeah.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:49.690
Kick her in the balls.

01:16:12.390 --> 01:16:13.620
I'm sending you
back to Gideon

01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.560
in a thousand pieces,
you slag!

01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:18.860
Ha!

01:16:24.540 --> 01:16:26.060
I'd rather be dead
than go back.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.510
He's a creep,
you're a bitch,

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:28.740
and you all deserve
each other.

01:16:28.810 --> 01:16:31.010
Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.

01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.170
Meaning?

01:16:32.250 --> 01:16:35.840
Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.

01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:41.220
I don't think I can hit
a girl. They're soft.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:42.420
You don't have a choice.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.710
Fight your own battles,
lazy ass!

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:11.410
Lazy ass!

01:17:18.390 --> 01:17:20.390
Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.360
Some sooner than others.

01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:29.370
Your BF's about to
get F'd in the B.

01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:32.530
Her weak point is
the back of her knees.

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:34.300
Wait, how does that work?

01:17:34.510 --> 01:17:36.980
Whenever we were making out I would just...

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.510
Okay, enough.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:52.450
You'll never be
able to do this to her.

01:18:06.410 --> 01:18:07.600
So...

01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.110
Two gin-and-tonics, please?

01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:10.370
I thought you didn't drink.

01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:13.240
Only on special occasions.
Why? Did you want one?

01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:16.320
Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?

01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:19.380
Maybe you could just give
me a list of all of your exes

01:18:19.460 --> 01:18:21.080
so that I can at least know who's going to

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.750
beat my ass
into the ground next.

01:18:22.830 --> 01:18:25.490
Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:27.050
Maybe we could
exchange our information.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:29.500
Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:30.830
for my mortal well-being,

01:18:30.900 --> 01:18:33.930
is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?

01:18:38.670 --> 01:18:40.370
I think we should split.

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.880
As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?

01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:44.440
I'd hope you could
figure that out.

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:46.480
Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?

01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:49.280
How could I? I feel like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.580
Dirty laundry.
You're drunk.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:51.940
I had, like, one drink.

01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.720
I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.

01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:56.780
I thought you might be
more understanding.

01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:58.050
I just...

01:18:58.130 --> 01:19:00.650
You're just another evil ex
waiting to happen.

01:19:03.370 --> 01:19:05.270
That was harsh.

01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:08.600
That was not good.

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:11.800
That was embarrassing.

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:14.200
One more.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.270
P.S. Here's your stupid list.

01:19:17.950 --> 01:19:20.940
Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.

01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.710
Who the hell are
the Katayanagi Twins?

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:24.910
Oh!

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.490
You don't know?

01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:28.950
The Katayanagi Twins

01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:31.420
just happen to be
the next band in the battle.

01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:35.230
They are totally bad-ass.

01:19:35.300 --> 01:19:37.290
Ramona dated twins?
Apparently.

01:19:37.370 --> 01:19:38.420
At the same time?

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.520
You know what?

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:40.970
I don't know
and I don't want to know.

01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.770
Good. Because you know how I feel
about girls blocking the rock.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.470
Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:46.670
If it's gonna be
an issue though,

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:47.800
Young Neil can
fill in for you.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.210
It's not an issue.
You know bands,

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.710
I know battles.
We got it covered.

01:19:50.910 --> 01:19:52.710
But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.

01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:54.080
Not only do I
want to take part

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:55.950
I want to take them apart.

01:19:56.390 --> 01:19:58.410
Okay, I'm getting tingles.

01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:59.580
Whoa!

01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:03.120
Okay, we're doomed.
Oh!

01:20:03.190 --> 01:20:05.490
That poster needs
more exclamation marks.

01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.560
Oh, man,
we're gonna get killed.

01:20:07.630 --> 01:20:09.220
Come on, we're going
on in five minutes.

01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.690
Wait, aren't the Katayanagis
going on first?

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:14.240
I think
you're both on first.

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:16.840
Wait, "Amp versus amp"?

01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:18.530
We're going on stage
at the same time?

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:19.840
That's impossible.

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:22.670
Okay, my bad.

01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:24.800
Your bad is
saying, "My bad.''

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:28.810
We shouldn't even be
here. We shouldn't even be here!

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:31.250
Come on, man! I put my
problems aside for the music.

01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.690
If I can do that,
we can do anything.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.280
Did you speak
to Ramona, then?

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:37.220
What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:38.350
Oh.

01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:39.690
She's totally here.

01:20:42.630 --> 01:20:43.720
Scott?

01:20:44.730 --> 01:20:46.130
Not that I care,

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:48.260
but you should go talk to her
before she's gone.

01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.860
Thanks, Kim.

01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.030
And I really don't care.

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.410
I didn't mean to
put you through all that.

01:20:54.480 --> 01:20:57.000
I only did it because I
love you. You know that.

01:21:34.520 --> 01:21:36.310
Okay, gang,
can we do this?

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:38.150
I mean,
we can do this, right?

01:21:38.220 --> 01:21:39.310
Right.

01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.620
Scott?

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:43.620
Scott!

01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:03.140
They tore the roof off!

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.510
<i>We are Sex Bob-Omb</i>

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:11.550
<i>and we're here to make you think
about death and get sad and stuff!</i>

01:22:14.220 --> 01:22:16.280
<i>This is the beginning
of the song.</i>

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:19.920
<i>I'm hearing voices, animal noises</i>

01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.360
<i>The creme de la creme</i>

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:22.950
<i>The feminine abyss</i>

01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:26.520
<i>And reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind</i>

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:30.040
<i>My body's stupid</i>

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:31.470
<i>Stereo putrid</i>

01:22:31.540 --> 01:22:33.060
<i>Spilling out music</i>

01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.510
<i>Into raw sewage</i>

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:37.740
<i>Reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind</i>

01:22:43.150 --> 01:22:48.580
<i>My threshold</i>

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.790
<i>Reaching</i>

01:22:51.630 --> 01:22:54.460
<i>My threshold</i>

01:23:05.610 --> 01:23:08.600
Let's just break
up now and get it over with.

01:23:08.680 --> 01:23:12.200
We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.210
Gideon's here? Where?

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.380
That geeky guy
next to your girlfriend.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:20.110
That's Gideon?

01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:22.380
Gideon is G-Man?

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.760
All right, let's do this.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.660
<i>Reaching my threshold</i>

01:23:29.730 --> 01:23:38.200
<i>My threshold</i>

01:24:24.250 --> 01:24:25.410
We're out.

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:31.350
What are you doing?

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:32.650
Getting a life.

01:24:46.340 --> 01:24:48.710
I just came to
see your show.

01:24:51.850 --> 01:24:53.080
I have to...

01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:02.580
Ramona.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.230
Ramona, I need to
tell you something.

01:25:06.290 --> 01:25:07.630
Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.720
Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.230
just to avoid getting hurt.

01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:15.400
I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.

01:25:15.470 --> 01:25:19.130
I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff

01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:21.110
because
I'm in lesbians with you.

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:22.600
What?

01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:24.040
I really, really mean it.

01:25:26.450 --> 01:25:28.040
Oh! Okay.

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.640
It's your turn. What
did you want to tell me?

01:25:31.450 --> 01:25:32.980
That we have to break up.

01:25:34.090 --> 01:25:35.250
What?

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:36.790
It's Gideon.

01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.290
I just can't...

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.160
I can't help myself
around him.

01:25:43.230 --> 01:25:45.100
That's the bad news.

01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.130
Hey.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:50.600
The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.

01:25:50.670 --> 01:25:52.260
Bob-Omb.
Three-piece rock outfit

01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:54.740
with a smoking hot
red-head on drums.

01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:56.640
Music to my ear-holes.

01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.710
You know what?
I'm not even going to wait

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:01.250
to see how you guys
do in the final.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.750
I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.

01:26:04.390 --> 01:26:07.250
See? I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:10.650
You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.

01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:14.020
No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.260
Ow! Scott.

01:26:16.770 --> 01:26:19.430
You got to try and keep
your emotions in check, man.

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.200
Don't let what's past
ruin your future.

01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:23.860
The people need
to hear us, Scott.

01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.530
Then you're gonna have to
find someone else to play bass.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.330
Whoops.

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.140
Sign, sign, sign,
and we are all set.

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:36.640
Sweetie, shall we?

01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:45.420
Oh! Scott.

01:26:45.930 --> 01:26:48.190
You know, we really should
be thanking each other.

01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:50.960
I mean, if it wasn't for me, Ramona
would never have been with you

01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:53.060
but if it wasn't for you she
wouldn't have gotten back with me,

01:26:53.130 --> 01:26:55.000
so I guess
it all shakes out.

01:26:56.470 --> 01:26:58.300
Scotty, buddy,

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:04.370
between you and I, the whole
League of Evil Exes thing?

01:27:05.050 --> 01:27:08.350
I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:10.610
Forgiven?

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:12.880
All right, let's go.

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:14.820
Yes!

01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.680
This is it, guys.
We are on our way.

01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:24.090
I said "lesbians.''

01:27:52.530 --> 01:27:54.090
Scott.

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.490
Was she really the one?

01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:58.430
The what?

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.800
I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?

01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:05.340
Like, with jetpacks.

01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:14.310
Time heals all wounds,
little brother.

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:18.840
Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends.

01:28:19.150 --> 01:28:20.180
Seven.

01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.380
That's not that bad.

01:28:23.690 --> 01:28:25.420
Hey. Yeah, I know.

01:28:25.630 --> 01:28:27.990
It's so pathetic!

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:32.720
Turn off the light!

01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:38.400
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk

01:28:38.740 --> 01:28:39.970
and I apologize for that.

01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.070
Okay.

01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.870
And he apologizes, too.

01:28:42.940 --> 01:28:44.000
Sorry.

01:28:45.410 --> 01:28:48.310
Scott,
you know I love you.

01:28:48.980 --> 01:28:50.980
But I'm gonna need
my own bed tonight.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:53.180
It's for sex.

01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.920
Right.

01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:58.720
I may need it for
the rest of the week, too.

01:28:59.030 --> 01:29:00.260
Right.

01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:01.420
And the year.

01:29:02.060 --> 01:29:03.330
I get it.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:05.090
Maybe you can
move in with Ramona.

01:29:06.570 --> 01:29:07.830
She's with Gideon.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:09.160
Oh, man.

01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:11.300
That's probably just because
he's better than you.

01:29:11.370 --> 01:29:12.470
Mmm.

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:15.510
Either way,
this fight is over.

01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:16.970
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:24.650 --> 01:29:27.020
It's for Scott.

01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.250
It's for you, big guy.

01:29:31.330 --> 01:29:32.320
Hello.

01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:33.590
<i>Hey, pal.</i>

01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:36.520
<i>I just want to say I feel
terrible about earlier.</i>

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:38.590
<i>I don't want
any hard feelings.</i>

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:42.100
<i>So I figured, why not be the
bigger man and just give you a call.</i>

01:29:42.170 --> 01:29:43.660
Is Ramona with you?

01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:47.170
I don't know.
Are you with me?

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:49.800
Yeah.

01:29:51.310 --> 01:29:53.940
Geez, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:56.810
No, I just spilled
hot cocoa on my crotch.

01:29:56.890 --> 01:29:57.980
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

01:29:58.050 --> 01:29:59.450
<i>Listen,
as you know,</i>

01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.550
<i>I'm opening a new
Chaos Theatre in Toronto.</i>

01:30:01.620 --> 01:30:03.850
And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.

01:30:03.930 --> 01:30:06.790
It would feel really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:10.660
They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!

01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:12.060
Yeah?
Maybe I'll see you there.

01:30:12.200 --> 01:30:13.530
<i>I hope so, amigo.</i>

01:30:13.870 --> 01:30:16.300
I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.

01:30:16.370 --> 01:30:17.430
What do you say?

01:30:17.510 --> 01:30:18.530
Mmm.

01:30:18.610 --> 01:30:19.870
Okay, laters.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.930
What a perfect asshole.

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.350
Forget what I said earlier.
Finish him.

01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:53.000
Password?

01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:54.170
Whatever.

01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:55.770
Cool.

01:31:00.180 --> 01:31:01.550
Second password?

01:31:04.350 --> 01:31:05.380
Cool.

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:12.120
<i>We're not having
no fun We're not having no fun</i>

01:31:12.190 --> 01:31:15.650
No. The first album is much
better than the first album.

01:31:15.730 --> 01:31:17.820
<i>Fun</i>

01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:21.200
<i>No fun</i>

01:31:26.410 --> 01:31:28.570
Scott! Let it go.

01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:30.800
Don't give him
the satisfaction.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:33.010
What if I want
the satisfaction?

01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:34.410
Scott Pilgrim!

01:31:36.180 --> 01:31:38.480
Buddy, welcome to
the Chaos Theatre.

01:31:38.850 --> 01:31:42.380
Somebody get this man a
drink. A Coke Zero, right?

01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:49.620
I'm not here to drink.

01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:51.990
Whoa, I've got
no beef with you.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.560
What if I have
a beef with you?

01:31:55.870 --> 01:31:58.740
Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?

01:31:59.010 --> 01:32:00.170
You mean The League?

01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:02.680
The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:04.410
I'll show you how ancient of history it is!

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:05.710
Wait, wait, wait!

01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:08.910
There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.

01:32:08.980 --> 01:32:13.610
The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.

01:32:13.690 --> 01:32:15.660
Well, I ain't moving, buddy.

01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:20.060
You wanna fight me for her?

01:32:20.130 --> 01:32:21.960
Was that not clear?

01:32:24.530 --> 01:32:25.760
Was that not clear?

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:26.930
I don't know.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:32.170
Now, why on earth
would you want to do that?

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:34.240
Because I'm in love with her.

01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:48.280
Aw! I think this
deserves a song.

01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.580
Kimberly!

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:51.890
<i>We are Sex Bob-Omb.</i>

01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:55.290
<i>We are here to make money
and sell out and stuff.</i>

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.590
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:55.550
Your club sucks,
by the way.

01:33:55.620 --> 01:34:00.220
Well, if my cathedral of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest

01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:03.090
for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:07.430
then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.

01:34:09.100 --> 01:34:12.000
And a fast entrance
into hell!

01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:14.040
Scott!

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:19.710
Knives?

01:34:19.780 --> 01:34:21.080
That's priceless.

01:34:21.150 --> 01:34:23.010
You'll pay for
what you did to him.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:25.110
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,

01:34:25.190 --> 01:34:28.020
your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.

01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:30.890
He was warned plenty of
times, but did he listen? No.

01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:33.450
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!

01:34:34.730 --> 01:34:35.790
What?

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:37.590
You broke the heart
that broke mine.

01:34:37.670 --> 01:34:39.960
Get ready to Chau down!

01:34:45.210 --> 01:34:46.430
You're kidding, right?

01:34:49.710 --> 01:34:50.800
Wow!

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:54.040
I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?

01:34:54.120 --> 01:34:55.510
That's incredible.

01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:08.420
What the hell is your deal?

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:12.160
You stole him!

01:35:13.700 --> 01:35:14.860
Stole him!

01:35:14.940 --> 01:35:16.730
I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:19.270
You liar! Liar!

01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:22.940
I didn't steal your boyfriend!
I didn't steal Scott!

01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:25.440
I didn't steal anyone!

01:35:33.190 --> 01:35:35.620
You steal
my boyfriend!

01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:36.880
Wait! Wait!

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.930
Can we please stop all this
fighting? Nobody stole anybody.

01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:42.830
Knives, I dated you
and then I dated Ramona, okay?

01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.160
Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:51.670
You cheated on me, Scott?

01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:55.400
You cheated on both of us?

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.170
You cheated on me
with Knives?

01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:58.840
No,

01:36:00.150 --> 01:36:02.670
I cheated on Knives
with you.

01:36:03.150 --> 01:36:04.240
Is there a difference?

01:36:05.020 --> 01:36:06.210
You weren't wronged?

01:36:07.720 --> 01:36:08.850
Right?

01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:12.850
Game over.

01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:18.990
Scotty,

01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.470
you can cheat on these ladies all you like.

01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:25.740
But you can't cheat

01:36:27.010 --> 01:36:28.100
death.

01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:36.940
Oh, man.

01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:41.210
Sorry.
Dying's got to suck.

01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:44.920
You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.

01:36:46.230 --> 01:36:47.820
Why him?

01:36:47.900 --> 01:36:49.490
It's complicated.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:51.690
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:55.030
so now might be
a good time to get into it.

01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.240
Truth is, it was me
who was obsessed.

01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:05.310
I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.

01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:10.470
I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.

01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:13.710
That's why I had to leave.

01:37:13.820 --> 01:37:16.920
And that's when
he started paying attention.

01:37:17.230 --> 01:37:18.620
So, why go back?

01:37:18.930 --> 01:37:20.550
I can't help myself
around him, Scott,

01:37:20.630 --> 01:37:24.560
he just has this way of
getting into my head.

01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:27.700
Well, that's
legitimately disappointing.

01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:29.930
I really will leave you alone forever now.

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.530
No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.

01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:36.070
That is evil.

01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:40.940
I didn't mean for you to
get dragged into this, Scott.

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.980
I just wanted
something simple.

01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:47.480
I'm sorry
it had to end this way.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.090
Well, I really
fought for you.

01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:53.090
Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.

01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:57.900
What? Wait.

01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:02.670
But I feel like
I learned something.

01:38:04.270 --> 01:38:06.260
Which would be great
if I wasn't dead.

01:38:10.110 --> 01:38:11.670
So alone.

01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:12.970
<i>You're not alone.</i>

01:38:15.750 --> 01:38:16.840
Right!

01:38:26.730 --> 01:38:27.990
Your hair looks stupid.

01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:31.660
Second password?

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.630
Yeah, I saw it.

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:38.830
It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.

01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:40.270
<i>No fun</i>

01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:42.700
Scott! Let it go.

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:44.110
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

01:38:44.180 --> 01:38:45.340
Stephen,
the new lineup rocks.

01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:46.780
You guys sound
way better without me.

01:38:47.080 --> 01:38:48.780
Young Neil,
you have learned well.

01:38:48.850 --> 01:38:52.220
From this point forward
you will be known as "Neil.''

01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:53.680
And, Kim,

01:38:54.590 --> 01:38:56.750
I'm sorry about everything.

01:38:58.030 --> 01:38:59.490
I'm sorry about me.

01:39:00.830 --> 01:39:03.020
Scott Pilgrim!
Hey, buddy!

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:06.560
Save it! You're
pretentious! This club sucks!

01:39:06.630 --> 01:39:08.160
I've got beef.
Let's do it.

01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.900
Wait, wait, wait!

01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:14.930
You want to
fight me for her?

01:39:15.210 --> 01:39:16.300
No.

01:39:17.010 --> 01:39:18.380
I want to fight you for me.

01:39:24.650 --> 01:39:26.180
Um...
Kim!

01:39:26.250 --> 01:39:28.740
We are Sex Bob-Omb
and we are here to watch

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:31.260
Scott Pilgrim
kick your teeth in!

01:39:31.330 --> 01:39:32.490
One! Two! Three! Four!

01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:55.070
How's it going back there?

01:39:56.350 --> 01:39:58.510
You dick!

01:39:59.490 --> 01:40:00.850
Knives?

01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.480
I know you're in here.
Don't attack...

01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:04.250
Scott!

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.220
Steal my boyfriend!

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:09.590
Taste my steel!

01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:11.660
Enough!

01:40:11.730 --> 01:40:12.820
No, Scott.

01:40:13.230 --> 01:40:15.830
This fat-ass hurt me
and I will have my revenge!

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:19.740
No, Knives, I hurt you.
I cheated on you.

01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:23.400
I cheated on both of you.

01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.140
I'm really sorry.

01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:29.220
And you're not a fat-ass.

01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.680
She didn't mean that.

01:40:34.090 --> 01:40:35.450
So, are we all good?

01:40:38.690 --> 01:40:40.160
Never felt better.

01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:41.660
Yoo-hoo!

01:40:42.730 --> 01:40:45.290
Are we done with
the hugging and learning?

01:40:46.570 --> 01:40:48.630
I thought we had
a fight going on here!

01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.270
You've got a fight,
all right!

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:53.060
Wrong move, baby.

01:41:09.490 --> 01:41:10.580
Hey.

01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:28.000
You made me
swallow my gum.

01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:33.300
It's gonna be in my digestive
tract for seven years.

01:42:17.190 --> 01:42:19.720
Yeah, still my girl.

01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:24.160
Let's both be girls.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:31.630
<i>Bad! Bad!</i>

01:42:43.820 --> 01:42:44.810
What?

01:42:44.890 --> 01:42:46.010
<i>Get ready!</i>

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:48.220
<i>Here we go!</i>

01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.730
<i>Good! Good! Good!</i>

01:43:00.170 --> 01:43:01.430
<i>Combo!</i>

01:43:05.740 --> 01:43:06.830
<i>Perfect!</i>

01:43:19.420 --> 01:43:22.550
Who do you
think you are, Pilgrim?

01:43:22.620 --> 01:43:25.020
You think you're
better than me?

01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:28.260
I'll tell you what you are.

01:43:28.330 --> 01:43:30.320
A pain in my ass!

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:34.700
You know
how long it took

01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.530
to get all the evil exes'
contact information

01:43:37.610 --> 01:43:40.200
so I could form
this stupid league?

01:43:40.270 --> 01:43:43.840
Like, two hours!
Two hours!

01:43:46.450 --> 01:43:48.570
You're not cool
enough for Ramona.

01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:51.210
You're zero!
You're nothing!

01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.750
Me? I'm what's hip.

01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:55.250
I'm what's happening!

01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:57.260
I'm blowing up right now!

01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:59.290
You are blowing up.

01:43:59.990 --> 01:44:01.220
Right now!

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.090
<i>K- O!</i>

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:17.200
Wow!

01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:24.110
Yeah, wow.

01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.010
There goes our deal!

01:44:32.090 --> 01:44:34.250
We're still
getting paid, right?

01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:36.690
There goes our deal.

01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:39.330
Oh! Oh, God!

01:44:50.140 --> 01:44:51.540
You two make
a good combo.

01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:53.710
Yeah?

01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:55.740
Yeah.

01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:58.940
<i>Scott Pilgrim.</i>

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:04.850
<i>You can defeat me, Scott,</i>

01:45:05.330 --> 01:45:08.850
<i>but can you defeat yourself?</i>

01:45:14.230 --> 01:45:15.460
Uh-oh!

01:45:16.300 --> 01:45:17.460
Nega Scott.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.160
<i>Nega Scott!</i>

01:45:23.210 --> 01:45:24.440
No.

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.580
This is something
I have to face.

01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:30.940
Myself.

01:45:33.090 --> 01:45:35.320
<i>Solo round!</i>

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.250
They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

01:45:40.330 --> 01:45:41.560
and you get bacon
on the side.

01:45:41.630 --> 01:45:42.750
I'm liking that.

01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:44.530
Let's do it next week.
Yeah, Tuesday.

01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:45.720
Yeah, all right. Be good.

01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:46.890
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:48.260
Hey.

01:45:49.670 --> 01:45:51.140
What happened?

01:45:51.210 --> 01:45:54.110
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

01:45:54.170 --> 01:45:55.900
We're gonna get
brunch next week.

01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:57.770
We actually have
a lot in common.

01:45:57.850 --> 01:46:00.840
Your hair,
it's getting really shaggy.

01:46:01.450 --> 01:46:03.140
It is?
Yeah.

01:46:04.590 --> 01:46:06.880
You should probably
get it cut.

01:46:07.690 --> 01:46:09.160
Yeah, you're right.

01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.650
I should get it cut.

01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.210
At a salon.

01:46:12.290 --> 01:46:14.660
Salon, yeah.
That sounds really nice.

01:46:14.730 --> 01:46:16.130
Hey.

01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:18.660
You're going?

01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.170
I should probably disappear.

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.970
After all that?

01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.730
I still need a new life.

01:46:26.540 --> 01:46:30.030
I came here to escape, but
the past keeps catching up.

01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:33.140
I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.

01:46:33.210 --> 01:46:35.580
I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna get over it.

01:46:36.250 --> 01:46:38.220
I don't mean just you.

01:46:41.090 --> 01:46:42.780
I understand.

01:46:44.630 --> 01:46:46.390
I should thank you, though.

01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:47.860
For what?

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.970
For being the nicest guy
I ever dated.

01:46:54.970 --> 01:46:56.730
That's kind of sad.

01:46:59.310 --> 01:47:01.100
It is kind of sad.

01:47:04.410 --> 01:47:05.900
Bye, and stuff.

01:47:07.150 --> 01:47:10.550
Yeah. And stuff.

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.860
Go, get her.

01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:20.260
What?

01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:23.060
You've been fighting
for her all along.

01:47:25.370 --> 01:47:26.800
But what about you?

01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:29.400
I'll be fine.

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:36.070
I'm too cool
for you anyway.

01:47:40.550 --> 01:47:41.780
<i>Ciao, Knives.</i>

01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:43.710
Go.

01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.620
Hey.

01:47:50.690 --> 01:47:53.060
Hey, mind if I tag along?

01:47:55.660 --> 01:47:57.100
You want to come with me?

01:47:57.500 --> 01:48:01.590
Yeah, I thought
maybe we could try again.

01:48:25.260 --> 01:48:30.360

Nine, eight, seven, six,</i>

01:48:30.430 --> 01:48:34.890
