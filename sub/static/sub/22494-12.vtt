00:04.910 --> 00:11.021
[thunder crashing]
[drilling, sawing]

00:18.024 --> 00:21.623
[electricity crackling]
It's alive!

00:28.033 --> 00:30.540
[laughs maniacally]

00:35.854 --> 00:38.491
"Casablankman"

00:39.148 --> 00:41.225
Now this is pod racing!

00:41.442 --> 00:43.108
You'll never get me again,
butthole!

00:43.389 --> 00:44.863
Slave boy no more!

00:46.926 --> 00:50.470
Eat your fucking salad.

00:50.609 --> 00:52.968
Look! We finally made it!

00:53.003 --> 00:56.854
The Legendary Pyraminxes!
They must be full of treasure!

00:57.449 --> 00:58.348
[all scream]

00:58.350 --> 00:59.116
Penis puzzle!

00:59.118 --> 01:01.051
You better keep your mouth off
it, Reynaldo!

01:01.053 --> 01:02.352
It's a snake, you jackass!

01:02.354 --> 01:05.433
Rubik the amazing cube
can help us/annoy us

01:05.468 --> 01:07.090
with his cutesy
'80s-cartoon voice!

01:07.092 --> 01:07.891
Give me that!

01:07.893 --> 01:09.960
Boys have better spatial
reasoning than girls!

01:09.962 --> 01:13.370
I'd be angry at that sexist comment
if it wasn't a proven scientific fact

01:13.405 --> 01:15.032
backed up by years
of academic research!

01:15.034 --> 01:16.867
And done!

01:16.869 --> 01:18.302
Rubik, here to help!

01:18.304 --> 01:21.262
Ugh, that voice is like getting
anal sexed in the ear canal!

01:21.297 --> 01:23.912
But first, Rubik been dying
to ask--

01:23.947 --> 01:26.814
Why did you turn Rubik back
into lifeless puzzle last time?

01:26.849 --> 01:28.845
Oh, uh... we had to get you
through customs.

01:28.847 --> 01:30.280
That was three days ago!

01:30.282 --> 01:33.450
Do you know where Rubik's spirit
goes when you jumble Rubik's colors?

01:33.452 --> 01:36.253
- A dark, cold neverland of hopelessness--
- Damn it, Rubik!

01:36.255 --> 01:38.188
What do you want,
an apology blowjob?

01:38.190 --> 01:38.956
Do something!

01:38.958 --> 01:40.157
Rubik, here to help!

01:40.159 --> 01:44.194
[laser fire]

01:44.196 --> 01:45.662

01:45.664 --> 01:46.859
Oh, no! No!

01:47.633 --> 01:49.066
[dog barking]

01:49.068 --> 01:51.802
Ohh, my anus!

01:51.804 --> 01:53.851
Do it, Rubik. End his pain!

01:53.886 --> 01:55.257
Rubik, here to help!

01:56.308 --> 01:57.374
Oh, Reynaldo!

01:57.376 --> 01:58.942
He's in a better place.

01:58.944 --> 02:01.645
A place without is-thay
butt licker-cay.

02:01.647 --> 02:02.412
Look out!

02:02.414 --> 02:02.980
Whoa!

02:02.982 --> 02:06.839
I don't know which way to run!
I have no spatial reasoning!

02:07.620 --> 02:10.583
Rubik, here to help.

02:11.323 --> 02:13.790
Aah! My seeing parts!

02:13.792 --> 02:15.659
Whoa!

02:15.661 --> 02:19.096
R-rubik? Rubik?

02:19.098 --> 02:21.845
Oh, there you are.
I'll bring you back, Rubik.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.427
Friendless nerd kids solve you
blindfolded all the time.

02:24.462 --> 02:27.188
I've seen it on Youtube when I
get bored of skateboard accidents.

02:39.592 --> 02:40.539
Hey!

02:41.987 --> 02:44.151
What?
Oh, is this not cool?

02:44.156 --> 02:45.789
I-I thought it was cool.

02:45.791 --> 02:48.185
I-I'm sor--
I-I thought it was cool.

02:50.729 --> 02:52.171
[rustling]

02:54.833 --> 02:55.932
Is this better?

02:55.934 --> 02:57.100
Are we cool now?

02:57.102 --> 02:58.969
Are we cool now?
A-are we cool now?

[vehicle doors open]

03:23.262 --> 03:26.363
[gasping]

03:26.365 --> 03:30.524
You-- You all stood there and
did nothing.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.869
Did nothing.
You did nothing!

03:37.582 --> 03:40.143
Back off, psycho!
Release that beautiful soul!

03:40.145 --> 03:40.744
Yeah!

03:40.746 --> 03:43.447
Sport hunting is murder,
you sick son of a bitch!

03:43.449 --> 03:45.615
Hey, hey, guys, this is
all totally legit.

03:45.617 --> 03:46.650
I've got my permits.

03:46.652 --> 03:48.902
Skinned them head to toe
just for kicks.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.388
I'll bet you feel like a real
big shot, don't you?

03:51.390 --> 03:52.055
Don't you?!

03:52.057 --> 03:52.956
Listen, guys.

03:52.958 --> 03:54.591
This is just my vacation, okay?

03:54.593 --> 03:56.293
I'm not looking for any trouble.

03:56.295 --> 03:59.116
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
No, don't tou-- aah!

04:01.467 --> 04:03.433
Come here. There you go.

04:03.435 --> 04:05.402
Come here.
Yeah, there you go.

04:05.404 --> 04:06.803
That guy's gone now.

04:06.805 --> 04:08.138
Look at him. He's filthy.

04:08.140 --> 04:09.239
Aww, shh, shh, shh.

04:09.241 --> 04:10.741
We're gonna make you all better.

04:10.743 --> 04:11.975
That's right.

04:11.977 --> 04:13.443
And there you go!

04:13.445 --> 04:16.242
Go on, boy! Go!
Run and be free!

04:16.749 --> 04:19.846
I don't understand why anyone would
hurt such an innocent creature.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.167
[snake hisses]

04:23.689 --> 04:26.623
[giggling]

04:26.625 --> 04:28.527
Are you having a good time,
Pinocchio?

04:28.562 --> 04:31.513
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, this is great.

04:31.548 --> 04:33.029
[moans]

04:33.031 --> 04:33.463
Oooh!

04:33.465 --> 04:36.199
Oh, you should ask before you
stick a finger in there!

04:36.201 --> 04:37.234
That wasn't a finger.

04:37.236 --> 04:38.957
This is fucking terrible.

04:41.614 --> 04:44.641
Klingon ship approaching.
Man the phasers, Mr. Sulu.

04:44.643 --> 04:47.043
Yes, captain.

04:47.045 --> 04:48.812
[electricity powers down]

04:48.814 --> 04:50.280
We've lost power!

04:50.282 --> 04:51.988
Mr. Spock, quickly,
tricoder reading.

04:53.018 --> 04:55.285

04:55.287 --> 04:56.787
Uhura, scanners!

04:56.789 --> 04:59.589

04:59.591 --> 05:02.159
Chekov, red alert, red alert!

05:02.161 --> 05:05.128
Rrrr-eeee! Wrrr-eeee!

05:05.130 --> 05:07.364
Dramatic battle music now!

05:07.366 --> 05:12.436
[all vocalizing dramatically]

05:12.438 --> 05:15.942
Scotty, monitor's down.
Give me a Klingon ship now!

05:20.460 --> 05:26.913
- Sulu, phasers, now!
- Bzzshh! Bzzshh! Bzzshh!

05:30.634 --> 05:33.010
Should we fire torpedoes?

05:35.036 --> 05:36.925
Not yet.

05:37.863 --> 05:39.029
Pizza? Check.

05:39.031 --> 05:40.163
La-z-boy? Check.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.880
Entertainment?

05:42.134 --> 05:43.099
Checkmate!

05:43.101 --> 05:46.069
Skating on top of this
skyscraper's a great idea, bros!

05:46.071 --> 05:48.271
Here comes the double
kick flip-- Whoa!

05:48.273 --> 05:50.029
- I'm falling!
- Great scott!

05:50.064 --> 05:51.041
Everybody, relax.

05:51.043 --> 05:52.809
He had a scare. I saved him.

05:52.811 --> 05:53.779
He's gonna be fine.

05:53.814 --> 05:56.646
Whoa! It worked, bros!
I got Supe'd!

05:56.648 --> 05:59.216
All: [chanting] We got Supe'd!
We got Supe'd!

05:59.218 --> 06:00.717
[chuckles]
You got what?

06:00.719 --> 06:02.049
What does he-- I got what?

06:02.054 --> 06:03.927
Hey, check it out!
My dad's gun.

06:04.056 --> 06:05.552
Great scott!

06:06.392 --> 06:09.456
- What were you guys thinking?
- Guys! I got the whole thing!

06:09.491 --> 06:10.756
Let's put it on Youtube!

06:10.758 --> 06:12.057
Yeah!
So epic!

06:12.059 --> 06:13.025
Hold on. You set me up?

06:13.027 --> 06:14.426
All: [chanting]
We got Supe'd!

06:14.428 --> 06:15.794
Oh, hell, no!
Give me that camera.

06:15.796 --> 06:17.791
Oh, someone help!
It's gonna blow!

06:17.865 --> 06:18.764
Come on!

06:18.766 --> 06:19.765
I'm not happy, but I'm here.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.633
Quickly, superman!
There's not a moment to lose!

06:21.635 --> 06:22.034
Yeah!

06:22.036 --> 06:23.869
Looks like you're gonna have to
save me, Superman!

06:23.871 --> 06:25.837
Really? It's up to me?
Okay.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.206
How, may I ask, did you get
strapped to a bomb?

06:28.208 --> 06:30.676
I don't know.
I think Lex Luger did it.

06:30.678 --> 06:32.210
Oh, Lex <i>Luger</i> did it?

06:32.212 --> 06:34.146
The wrestler?
He did this? Wow.

06:34.148 --> 06:35.798
I mean, I usually fight
Lex <i>Luthor,</i>

06:35.799 --> 06:37.449
but that guy
sounds really bad.

06:37.451 --> 06:39.420
- Hurry! It's ticking down!
- Oh, don't worry.

06:39.455 --> 06:42.022
I will, 'cause I really
believe you,

06:42.023 --> 06:44.589
so let me just use the old super
muscles on this chain and --

06:44.591 --> 06:47.859
Uh-oh!
Made of kryptonite.

06:47.861 --> 06:48.927
What? No, it's not!

06:48.929 --> 06:49.695
Yeah, it is.

06:49.697 --> 06:51.363
Oh, I guess I can't save you.

06:51.398 --> 06:54.560
Oh, and that's too bad,
considering this bomb looks so real

06:54.622 --> 06:58.073
and couldn't possibly be made of parts
you found in your parents' garage.

06:58.339 --> 06:59.271
Yeah!

06:59.273 --> 07:02.635
"The Total Package" is back,
Superman!

07:02.710 --> 07:03.642
Go, Lex Luger!

07:03.644 --> 07:07.145
It's your birthday! It's your birthday!
It's your birthday!

07:07.147 --> 07:08.513
It's your birthday!
It's your birthda--

07:10.038 --> 07:12.406
Rex, here, boy!

07:14.183 --> 07:17.183
[yawns]

07:17.891 --> 07:21.927
[footsteps]

07:21.929 --> 07:22.928

07:39.947 --> 07:42.247
Hey, boy, want to play fetch?

07:42.249 --> 07:45.961
[grumbles]

07:46.253 --> 07:47.786
Come on, come on!
One more!

07:47.788 --> 07:49.054
You can do this, He-Man!

07:49.056 --> 07:51.906
Can this be the end of
He-Man?

07:52.092 --> 07:54.126
Ah, rest it on your throat,
chump.

07:54.128 --> 07:56.061
Aren't you supposed to be in
spin class?

07:56.063 --> 07:57.799
Already spinning!

07:58.365 --> 07:59.231
Spinning!

07:59.233 --> 08:00.098
Spinning!

08:00.100 --> 08:01.533
Spinning!
Spinning-- Aah!

08:01.534 --> 08:05.296
Things here at the 24-hour Flip-Lex
have gotten crazy,

08:05.357 --> 08:09.042
ever since the Snake Mountain's
gotten shut down for black mould.

08:09.077 --> 08:09.274
[chuckles]

08:09.276 --> 08:11.262
Black mould's really
bad for breathing.

08:13.614 --> 08:15.246
Oh, hey, I'll get that for you.

08:15.482 --> 08:16.081
[farts]

08:16.083 --> 08:16.982
Oops! [laughs]

08:16.984 --> 08:18.698
Aw, come on!

08:19.686 --> 08:22.087
Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

08:22.089 --> 08:24.756
Their professions require
them to work out constantly.

08:24.758 --> 08:26.894
They either have
to be ripped like gods

08:26.985 --> 08:30.688
or built like lingerie models--
Or, for some, both.

08:30.998 --> 08:32.364
[grunting]

08:32.366 --> 08:34.633
This is a new personal best!

08:34.635 --> 08:35.667
Uh-huh.

08:35.669 --> 08:36.501
Uh-huh.

08:36.503 --> 08:38.270
[grunting]

08:38.272 --> 08:40.403
You're such a dirty birdie.

08:40.707 --> 08:41.972
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:41.975 --> 08:43.746
- You paying attention up there?
- Oh, yeah.

08:44.077 --> 08:45.924
Something's obscuring my
vision.

08:46.013 --> 08:46.545
Uh-huh.

08:46.547 --> 08:49.126
What the hell is that, man?
It's-- It's getting bigger.

08:49.583 --> 08:50.916
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

08:50.918 --> 08:51.850
Oh, my God!

08:51.852 --> 08:54.052
Get your fucking boner off
of my--

08:54.054 --> 08:54.820
[groans]

08:54.822 --> 08:58.056
You care if I change
the channel?

08:58.058 --> 08:59.357
Really? Rachael Ray?

08:59.359 --> 09:00.392
Yeah. So what?

09:00.394 --> 09:01.793
Your name is Evil-Lyn.

09:01.795 --> 09:06.264
I thought you'd watch something
more, you know [mockingly] evil!

09:06.266 --> 09:08.366
What do you think I watch
when I'm on the treadmill,

09:08.368 --> 09:09.301
"Faces of Death"?

09:09.303 --> 09:10.168
Yeah, maybe.

09:10.170 --> 09:12.597
Rachael Ray's husband pays
chicks to spit on him.

09:14.074 --> 09:15.466
Allegedly.

09:16.276 --> 09:19.279
You know, just a fun fact.

09:19.346 --> 09:20.979
So, that yellow skin--

09:20.981 --> 09:23.482
Is that
a vitamin deficiency or...?

09:23.484 --> 09:26.918
Yeah. Unlike you, I'm all
out of vitamin bitch.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.154
Fine! Forget it, Anal-Lyn.

09:29.323 --> 09:31.453
Greetings, girls!

09:31.488 --> 09:33.725
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God.

09:33.727 --> 09:37.062
[farts] Whew! Whoa!

09:37.064 --> 09:39.030
Hot in here!

09:39.032 --> 09:42.820
I love a good sweat, but it sure
makes my cooter itch.

09:42.855 --> 09:51.643
[ratcheting]

09:51.645 --> 09:54.880
Wow! It like you guys not
trying hard at all.

09:54.882 --> 09:56.481
Look who's talking.

09:56.483 --> 09:59.580
I only affect the "dur" voice
to better complete the illusion

09:59.689 --> 10:03.663
I'm you,
you spray-tanned side of beef.

10:04.458 --> 10:08.426
[growls] I'd kill that guy
if we weren't so evenly matched!

10:08.428 --> 10:11.309
You know, maybe I could help
you with that problem.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.534
