00:25.006 --> 00:26.046
Free Tibet!

00:26.058 --> 00:27.098
Free Tibet!

00:28.001 --> 00:30.030
Return the Dalai Lama to Tibet!

04:16.003 --> 04:17.089
Hey, you need to clear the area!

04:18.007 --> 04:19.071
Wha... What happened to him?

04:19.071 --> 04:20.071
Drowned.

04:21.098 --> 04:24.054
You're a journo, Daily Nation, right?

04:24.054 --> 04:25.091
Yeah, Harriett Dunkley.

04:25.094 --> 04:27.062
Who... Who am I speaking to?

04:27.062 --> 04:28.097
Media liaison.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.077
I'm sure you've got their number.

04:30.078 --> 04:33.059
What are they gonna tell me? That there's
a killer shark in lake Burley Griffin?

04:33.059 --> 04:36.024
Come on, this is a crime scene.
Go.

04:58.030 --> 05:00.005
So, what have we got on Sabine Hobbs?

05:00.008 --> 05:03.029
Oh Gus, I swear, if you make me do another
story on her, I'm gonna self-immolate.

05:03.029 --> 05:06.030
What do we know about this prison
that China has moved her to?

05:06.033 --> 05:07.075
Hubei Provincial Women's Prison.

05:07.075 --> 05:10.064
Right... She would be better off, if she
hadn't survived the third-degree burns.

05:10.064 --> 05:11.088
It's where they send the wicked

05:11.088 --> 05:13.029
- terrorists.
- I don't think even the Chinese

05:13.029 --> 05:15.062
 can pretend that a misguided
choir girl is a terrorist.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.057
20 years in maximum security says they can.

05:18.092 --> 05:20.001
- Harry?
- Yeah?

05:20.004 --> 05:21.076
Any word at the PM's Office?

05:21.079 --> 05:22.079
Ah, no.

05:22.082 --> 05:26.057
Everyone has clammed up since sentencing.
Cabinet, backbench walk with a muzzle on.

05:26.057 --> 05:28.044
So, we're back to recycling an expert or

05:28.047 --> 05:30.045
speculating on the speculation?
Is that what we're doing?

05:30.045 --> 05:32.074
We have to run the same
sob stories in tabloids.

05:32.077 --> 05:35.023
We need a fig leaf of respectability.

05:35.026 --> 05:37.011
- Get me something.
- Well, the video has

05:37.014 --> 05:39.011
had more than
3 million hits on YouTube.

05:39.014 --> 05:40.085
Since when did Youtube become news?

05:40.088 --> 05:42.028
About ten years ago, I think.

05:42.031 --> 05:44.097
So, we've got the Medicare thing.
The Senate estimate

05:44.097 --> 05:46.068
child care rebates.

05:46.071 --> 05:49.010
And there's rumblings
of a leadership spill.

05:49.013 --> 05:50.048
Which party?

05:51.021 --> 05:52.021
The Greens.

05:52.021 --> 05:53.020
[Laughs]

05:53.020 --> 05:54.031
Anything else?

05:55.044 --> 05:56.083
I... I've got something.

05:57.066 --> 06:00.061
A corpse, in the lake,
washed up this morning.

06:01.027 --> 06:04.037
- It wasn't your career, was it?
- It was your sex life, actually.

06:04.094 --> 06:06.084
Yeah, Harriett, I'm afraid a pissed up

06:06.087 --> 06:08.067
ANU student,
falling in the drink,

06:08.070 --> 06:10.095
is not exactly a national
political bombshell.

06:10.098 --> 06:12.018
No, but this was

06:12.053 --> 06:14.030
was gutted like a fish.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.028
Alright, run with it.
 See where it leads.

06:16.028 --> 06:17.028
Thank you.

06:18.001 --> 06:19.036
Back to it, people.

06:22.034 --> 06:23.034
Sorry.

06:28.030 --> 06:30.011
Harriett DUNKLEY
POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT

06:32.048 --> 06:35.088
Hey, Sacha, did you see
who put this on my desk?

06:40.070 --> 06:42.025
Is that Mal Paxton?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.037
Yeah.

06:48.033 --> 06:49.063
I'm not touching it.

07:03.053 --> 07:05.058
Should I order everyone some tea?

07:05.077 --> 07:07.067
We're not running a cafÃ©, Ronnie.

07:09.038 --> 07:12.008
In the past 72 hours, Beijing have moved

07:12.008 --> 07:14.025
Shenyang J-16 fighter jets

07:14.025 --> 07:16.052
onto the disputed islands
in the South China sea.

07:16.052 --> 07:20.021
All our chatter says the
chinese command is on high allert.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.012
They expect the US to blink.

07:22.012 --> 07:23.012
And will I?

07:23.012 --> 07:26.043
They've invited us to join naval
 exercises in the disputed border.

07:26.043 --> 07:28.024
HMAS ANZAC is ready to sail.

07:28.038 --> 07:29.070
Minister, we are

07:29.070 --> 07:32.017
woefully unprepared
for a military build up.

07:32.017 --> 07:33.090
We need two new
submarines quickly.

07:33.090 --> 07:36.034
We can acquire Soyuz
from off the shelf in Japan.

07:36.035 --> 07:38.076
If we don't act,Beijing will 
take control of the world's

07:38.076 --> 07:41.033
busiest sea lane,
unchallenged.

07:41.033 --> 07:44.013
We cannot afford
to sit on our hands.

07:44.025 --> 07:45.050
I agree.

07:49.041 --> 07:51.076
So, we send our own message.

07:53.032 --> 07:57.028
We won't be throwing warships
into a U.S.-led pissing contest.

07:57.064 --> 08:00.088
We tell our allies
to go and piss somewhere else.

08:00.088 --> 08:04.012
And I won't be shifting our policy
that submarines will be made here,

08:04.032 --> 08:05.051
at ASC Osborne.

08:06.035 --> 08:08.021
It's a big boost
for local manufacture.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.044
Minister, the Japanese contract
is billions of dollars cheaper.

08:11.044 --> 08:13.063
So, we cancel a few joint strike fighters.

08:15.018 --> 08:16.098
The Pentagon won't like it.

08:17.071 --> 08:19.097
Well, I don't work for
the Pentagon, General.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.036
Neither do you.

08:21.076 --> 08:23.071
I won't be taking this to Cabinet.

08:23.094 --> 08:26.014
Minister, with respect...

08:26.087 --> 08:29.089
your previous experience is
as Minister for Resources.

08:29.089 --> 08:33.030
And your previous experience
is as a soldier, General.

08:33.030 --> 08:36.030
So, you should know
how to follow an order.

08:40.059 --> 08:42.049
I fuckin' hate Labour Governments.

08:49.078 --> 08:51.072
- Australian Federal Police.
- Hey yeah, can you please,

08:51.072 --> 08:53.099
put me through to
the pathologist on duty?

08:54.020 --> 08:56.045
- Who should I say is calling?
- Media Liaison.

08:56.079 --> 08:57.094
Putting you through.

09:02.082 --> 09:04.049
- Pathology.
- Hi,

09:04.049 --> 09:06.052
it's Harriett Dunkley, from the Daily Nation.

09:06.052 --> 09:08.085
I'm calling regarding a dead
body on the lake, this morning.

09:08.085 --> 09:10.086
I was wondering if you've had
a chance to examine it.

09:10.087 --> 09:12.027
Yeah, you know the drill.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.091
You have to go
through Media Liaison.

09:14.091 --> 09:17.081
Yeah, but we both know that they're just
 gonna give me the runaround, so...

09:17.081 --> 09:19.081
[Call disconnects]

09:49.034 --> 09:51.068
It's me. She is on her way to the morgue.

09:52.006 --> 09:54.056
Anything from our 
friend at the Embassy?

10:20.060 --> 10:23.073
I'm coming in now, if this gentleman
  would just hold the door open for me.

10:24.006 --> 10:25.066
Thank you very much, sir.

10:27.025 --> 10:29.060
Who says chivalry is dead?

10:32.030 --> 10:34.075
Hoy!
Can I see your security pass?

10:38.007 --> 10:39.084
Senior Constable Brimmer.

10:39.085 --> 10:42.022
Journalists. You'd sell 
your own grandmother.

10:43.044 --> 10:45.029
Are you in the market 
for a grandmother?

10:48.021 --> 10:49.033
He's only a kid.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.056
24 years old.

10:52.050 --> 10:54.068
Has his family made the ID?

10:54.069 --> 10:56.057
You know I can't answer that.

10:57.026 --> 10:59.006
Any personal effects?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.044
Being held in evidence.

11:01.048 --> 11:04.009
So, you have a name
and a date of birth?

11:04.009 --> 11:06.041
- You're gonna have to speak to...
- Yeah, yeah.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.095
Media Liaison.

11:09.082 --> 11:11.012
Any theories on

11:11.062 --> 11:14.080
who or why he was cut open,
strictly off the record?

11:17.083 --> 11:19.053
Did he swallow something?

11:23.045 --> 11:24.070
Media Liaison.

11:29.073 --> 11:31.053
Come on! All I need is an ID!

11:34.030 --> 11:37.005
You might wanna read the writing
on the wall in this one, Harriett.

12:46.082 --> 12:48.007
Fuck you, Griff.

12:51.012 --> 12:52.087
Your corpse from the lake?

13:00.052 --> 13:01.052
Hey, Gus.

13:03.089 --> 13:06.012
I got a name from 
a uniform at the morgue.

13:06.012 --> 13:07.037
And get this...

13:07.037 --> 13:09.055
he has no social media presence.

13:09.055 --> 13:12.032
And no Facebook,
no Instagram, no Twitter.

13:12.032 --> 13:15.027
What 24 year-old
has no online presence?

13:15.060 --> 13:18.005
- Are you asking me?
- Well, I know kids that

13:18.005 --> 13:20.037
would rather be dead,
than not on Snapchat.

13:20.037 --> 13:22.009
Maybe he had an alias.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.002
That's what my kids do.
To keep away prying parents.

13:26.037 --> 13:27.042
Yeah, maybe.

13:28.029 --> 13:31.024
Hey, do you still have that contact 
at Births, Deaths and Marriages?

13:31.024 --> 13:32.092
- Yeah.
- Can I get that of you?

13:32.092 --> 13:34.044
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

13:34.044 --> 13:36.076
Back to doing things 
the old-fashioned way?

13:36.077 --> 13:38.098
No, Max Dalgetty may not
 have a Facebook profile,

13:38.098 --> 13:41.003
but I assume that he 
must have been born.

13:42.056 --> 13:45.091
It does feel odd that there is no digital 
footprint from someone from a generation

13:45.091 --> 13:47.073
that doesn't believe in privacy.

13:47.073 --> 13:48.073
Vaughn.

13:53.074 --> 13:56.018
Are you taking a personal
 interest in Dalgetty?

13:56.042 --> 13:59.094
This has a whiff of Beijing about it.
It's central to my brief.

14:00.072 --> 14:03.012
And the obvious conflict of interest?

14:03.090 --> 14:06.044
Are you directing me to red-flag it?

14:06.044 --> 14:09.088
It's best there's no confusion,
in matters of "X" versus "Y".

14:10.044 --> 14:12.034
Don't you think, Miss Gordon?

14:14.076 --> 14:16.068
He runs from the Chinese Embassy

14:16.068 --> 14:19.074
and ends up dead by the lake.
Aren't you interested?

14:19.095 --> 14:22.005
The rules are there to protect us.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.039
Hey, Brimmer, it's... it's a false ID.

14:37.056 --> 14:40.007
- What do you mean?
- It's a stolen identity,

14:40.007 --> 14:41.056
I called the Registry.

14:41.057 --> 14:43.081
There's only a record for one Max Dalgetty,

14:43.081 --> 14:46.015
in the whole country, 
and he died 7 years ago.

14:46.016 --> 14:48.083
He is the same age profile as 
the deceased on the lake.

14:49.054 --> 14:52.077
You're gonna have to check the body
for markings... and dental records.

14:52.077 --> 14:54.030
Well, it's a bit late for that.

14:54.030 --> 14:57.002
- What do you mean?
- The body has already been transferred.

14:57.014 --> 14:58.033
Transferred where?

14:58.058 --> 14:59.062
I don't know.

15:00.006 --> 15:01.086
You don't know or you're 
 not allowed to tell me?

15:02.001 --> 15:03.001
Both.

15:03.082 --> 15:06.045
I guess something strange
is going on here.

15:07.066 --> 15:08.066
That,

15:08.080 --> 15:10.069
that's not Max Dalgetty.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.012
Hey, something's happening to your phone.

15:12.094 --> 15:14.007
FILE DELETED.

15:14.029 --> 15:15.033
No.

15:16.025 --> 15:18.000
No, no!

15:18.015 --> 15:21.060
New-age burglary.
That's a little outside my jurisdiction.

15:39.092 --> 15:41.003
Hello, Harry.

15:43.019 --> 15:44.086
We didn't wipe your photo.

15:44.086 --> 15:47.099
But I noticed that you haven't 
denied monitoring my phone.

15:47.099 --> 15:50.021
ASD categorically denies

15:50.021 --> 15:53.056
tracing, monitoring and
intercepting all domestic calls.

15:53.056 --> 15:55.011
- Yeah.
- Harry.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.045
Can you get Thomas to take a look at it?

15:59.014 --> 16:01.035
'Cause if ASD didn't delete 
my Dalgetty picture,

16:01.035 --> 16:03.059
than maybe he can find out who did.

16:04.084 --> 16:07.094
When did I become
your research assistant?

16:09.051 --> 16:11.071
Don't pretend you don't wanna know.

16:14.052 --> 16:16.025
- Ok.
- Thank you.

16:24.072 --> 16:25.082
Is that a new dress?

16:26.035 --> 16:27.055
Yeah, do you like it?

16:28.039 --> 16:29.039
Yeah,

16:29.063 --> 16:30.063
I do.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.035
You would tell me?

16:33.091 --> 16:34.091
Yes.

16:42.005 --> 16:43.069
Is there someone special?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.092
No.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.057
No, no, no, no.

16:51.084 --> 16:53.024
Nothing like that.

17:47.053 --> 17:49.083
I thought you weren't going near it, Harry.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.056
Which rock

17:53.056 --> 17:55.043
have you been hiding under,

17:55.072 --> 17:59.000
not to know about the
30 billion dollars incall,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.005
otherwise known as the

18:00.005 --> 18:01.099
"Collins Class Kockum",

18:02.027 --> 18:04.029
by those half-wits in Osborne?

18:04.068 --> 18:08.019
The only reason they got the
subs contract in the first place

18:08.019 --> 18:11.001
was pork barreling
 for a by-election.

18:11.046 --> 18:12.064
Don't think

18:12.084 --> 18:14.090
I don't know what you're up to,

18:15.030 --> 18:19.025
or that you've got Beijing 
on fuckin' speed-dial.

18:20.048 --> 18:21.098
Sixty percent

18:21.098 --> 18:23.057
of our trade

18:23.057 --> 18:25.084
goes through those shipping lanes.

18:26.009 --> 18:29.075
There's only one way to 
force China to back down.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.095
We stand by the U.S.!

18:32.016 --> 18:33.049
And their allies.

18:33.081 --> 18:36.017
And we bring in strike fighters

18:36.017 --> 18:38.008
and we bring in submarines!

18:38.050 --> 18:40.045
Japanese submarines!

18:40.066 --> 18:42.016
Made by people

18:42.034 --> 18:45.040
who make things that actually work!

18:45.040 --> 18:47.064
Better get yourself a raincoat, Mal,

18:47.064 --> 18:49.040
because you've unleashed

18:49.040 --> 18:52.084
a shit storm
of biblical proportions.

18:53.045 --> 18:54.082
Fuckin' hell!

18:58.062 --> 19:00.027
- Harriett.
- Minister.

19:04.026 --> 19:06.081
- Ronnie!
- Don't worry, I'm not staying.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.033
Just a little happy snap
for your family album.

19:16.030 --> 19:17.068
Where did you get this?

19:17.082 --> 19:20.029
I don't know, which is 
why you should be worried.

19:20.030 --> 19:23.051
Vindictiveness is never an 
attractive quality, Harriett.

19:23.051 --> 19:26.014
Misuse of mining union
 funds for campaigning and

19:26.015 --> 19:27.090
brand stacking is one thing, Mal.

19:28.020 --> 19:31.067
But a Federal Minister
failing to disclose and arrest record?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.032
It's a new low.

19:33.071 --> 19:36.076
Should I give you my BSB 
and account details now?

19:36.076 --> 19:39.087
So you can make those defamation
 payments direct, this time?

19:40.015 --> 19:41.065
I'm not touching that.

19:42.007 --> 19:44.063
I've banged my head against 
the Paxton wall enough.

19:44.064 --> 19:45.084
So, what's this?

19:46.051 --> 19:48.036
Just a friendly warning?

19:49.008 --> 19:50.033
Not friendly.

20:30.052 --> 20:31.052
Thomas.

20:31.098 --> 20:32.098
Hey.

20:33.021 --> 20:36.037
When you get a minute, can you
 check this for a remote breach?

20:36.058 --> 20:38.097
Someone deleted 
a crime scene photo.

20:38.097 --> 20:40.017
Was it us?

20:40.045 --> 20:42.035
It could be ASIO, ASIS,

20:42.035 --> 20:44.078
CIA, NSS, take your pick.

20:48.013 --> 20:50.051
The Dalgetty phone.
Where did you get this?

20:50.066 --> 20:51.073
The Director.

20:51.093 --> 20:53.076
Came in from the Federal Police.

20:53.099 --> 20:56.014
Vaughn wants the data retrieved.

20:59.060 --> 21:00.069
Hey, Thomas,

21:00.069 --> 21:03.087
that phone I just gave you, 
let's just keep that between us, okay?

21:08.031 --> 21:09.036
Sure, Kim.

21:18.092 --> 21:20.097
Attorney, can I have one minute?

21:21.017 --> 21:24.014
You can have 20 meters
 to the Treasurer's office

21:24.014 --> 21:25.058
while I send a tweet.

21:25.085 --> 21:28.061
Paxton is gonna build the
submarines in Australia?

21:28.092 --> 21:30.084
I'm sure he has his reasons

21:30.098 --> 21:32.088
at this critical time.

21:33.017 --> 21:36.081
As in, "don't tie Australia to 
an alliance against Beijing

21:36.081 --> 21:39.006
while Sabine Hobbs
rots in a Chinese prison"?

21:39.006 --> 21:41.037
You know the rules,
deep background only.

21:41.037 --> 21:43.042
If you want a quote, go to Paxton.

21:43.042 --> 21:46.004
But, either way, wouldn't most 
Labour MPs support him?

21:46.050 --> 21:49.025
Not if it means risking the U.S. alliance.

21:49.026 --> 21:51.074
It's he last article 
of faith to the Right.

21:51.092 --> 21:54.077
The only thing keeping my faction together.

21:55.019 --> 21:57.048
Well, that and their fear of you, Attorney.

21:57.048 --> 21:58.078
Thank you, Harriett.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.005
I need to speak to you.

22:24.082 --> 22:26.097
How did that photo get out?

22:31.081 --> 22:33.026
Hey, Sacha, do me a favour,

22:33.027 --> 22:37.005
I'm looking  to why Mal Paxton was in China, circa 20 years ago.

22:37.046 --> 22:40.030
Because of a study trip
or a union junket.

22:40.030 --> 22:41.065
Give me a sec.

22:42.068 --> 22:45.016
Already checked it. In June 1992,

22:45.016 --> 22:48.046
he was on a Young 
Labour Delegation to Beijing.

22:48.058 --> 22:51.003
Who was Head of Mission, then?

22:59.071 --> 23:03.032
Well, I am reliably informed that 
you are the resident expert on

23:03.032 --> 23:05.026
all things China,
Mr. Rankin.

23:05.026 --> 23:08.005
I wouldn't say expert. 
"Aficionado", maybe.

23:08.030 --> 23:10.061
So you were there before
 and after Tienanmen?

23:11.002 --> 23:12.007
Yeah, indeed.

23:12.060 --> 23:15.017
And despite the trouble, 
China was modernizing

23:15.018 --> 23:17.039
and we had cause for optimism.

23:17.039 --> 23:19.054
A lot of senior Australians visiting too.

23:19.054 --> 23:22.047
Oh, I did host a lot of 
important people from the

23:22.047 --> 23:24.012
Prime Minister down.

23:25.019 --> 23:28.066
I supposed some of them 
weren't such big names, but

23:28.066 --> 23:31.032
emerged later,
 like Malcolm Paxton.

23:32.069 --> 23:34.044
I understand that he was

23:34.044 --> 23:37.040
in Beijing for several months, in 1992.

23:38.003 --> 23:40.023
Yes, I... I do recall it, he was there.

23:40.085 --> 23:43.060
Was there a diplomatic 
incident of some kind?

23:44.043 --> 23:45.072
Police trouble?

23:46.003 --> 23:49.068
I know that he was arrested. 
And you were Head of Mission, so...

23:50.015 --> 23:52.000
you would know that too.

23:53.080 --> 23:56.075
Mr. Paxton has proven
 to be a professional

23:56.075 --> 23:59.090
blind spot, in the past, 
for you, Miss Dunkley.

24:00.056 --> 24:03.047
I would hate for History 
to repeat, over such a...

24:03.047 --> 24:05.022
trivial matter.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.082
Just in case...

24:16.002 --> 24:18.047
Thank you so much 
for the tea, Mr. Rankin.

24:36.039 --> 24:38.069
Harriett Dunkley has just been here.

24:49.040 --> 24:50.049
Prime Minister.

24:50.049 --> 24:53.048
Catriona tells me you set the cat
among the pigeons, Mal.

24:53.088 --> 24:57.060
No. I said the cat, actually, 
fucked the pigeons.

24:58.086 --> 25:00.015
Mal is right.

25:00.084 --> 25:03.069
Locking-in the Japanese subs 
would be taking sides.

25:03.092 --> 25:06.062
Admit it, Mal, you 
and your panda mates

25:06.062 --> 25:08.062
want to squirm away from allies

25:08.062 --> 25:10.060
- who've had our backs...
- Since when?

25:10.076 --> 25:12.067
Since Vietnam or Iraq?

25:12.096 --> 25:14.073
Seriously, Catriona, 
with friends like those...

25:14.073 --> 25:16.092
It's a bad time to 
commit to a new direction.

25:17.004 --> 25:20.051
A silly girl sets herself
 on fire, in Beijing

25:20.051 --> 25:23.000
and we betray our closest ally?

25:23.000 --> 25:25.027
A prison swap has been raised.

25:25.051 --> 25:26.062
They're willing to deal.

25:26.062 --> 25:28.002
Not in so many words.

25:28.035 --> 25:30.015
Solely for the right offer.

25:30.085 --> 25:34.009
America will not let 
Beijing put a choke hold

25:34.009 --> 25:37.023
on world trade. Why do you think they've pivoted towards Asia?

25:37.054 --> 25:39.090
The dragon has stirred, 
it needs to be contained.

25:39.090 --> 25:42.044
For fuck's sake,
we are not joining a new arms race

25:42.045 --> 25:45.009
in isolating our biggest trading partner.

25:45.083 --> 25:46.083
Martin.

25:48.078 --> 25:50.041
You've seen the polls.

25:50.098 --> 25:52.092
Until Sabine Hobbs gets home,

25:52.092 --> 25:56.002
we do nothing that might upset Beijing.

26:07.078 --> 26:08.088
Do you mind?

26:09.070 --> 26:13.051
Don't let the "Greens" catch you.
You know how they feel about old-growth forests.

26:14.057 --> 26:15.068
Mal Paxton

26:16.020 --> 26:19.088
has killed the plan to 
buy Soyuz subs in Japan.

26:19.088 --> 26:22.064
Avoid offending Beijing,
 while they still hold Sabine Hobbs.

26:22.076 --> 26:26.014
- Have you got a quote from Paxton?
- I'm not exactly on his Christmas card list.

26:26.014 --> 26:28.033
Give it to someone Paxton will talk to.

26:28.033 --> 26:31.076
- Please, Gus, not Griff.
- He is running national political on Hobbs.

26:32.015 --> 26:34.030
What about your drowned kid?

26:35.047 --> 26:37.019
The photo was wiped from my phone.

26:37.019 --> 26:39.038
Some kind of hack.
Kim is looking into it.

26:39.066 --> 26:42.008
Still got your ex-husband
 doing your dirty work?

26:43.032 --> 26:46.042
- What's this'?
- Sabine Hobbs' press pack.

26:46.042 --> 26:49.048
- Make Head Office happy.
- Don't make me do a puff piece!

26:50.051 --> 26:52.082
Human interest is for 
journos interested in humans.

26:52.082 --> 26:54.015
I do politicians.

26:54.016 --> 26:56.068
It's the last days of the 
dinosaurs here, Harry.

26:56.068 --> 26:59.074
Circulation is plummeting. 
My gold retirement watch is ticking.

26:59.074 --> 27:01.098
And you're still in the dog house.

27:02.095 --> 27:04.090
Close the door on your way out.

27:14.005 --> 27:16.079
9 months ago,
Sabine Hobbs won the prestigious

27:16.079 --> 27:18.065
Beijing Music Academy scholarship

27:18.065 --> 27:22.014
resulting in her, now, 
infamous and ill-fated trip to China.

27:22.085 --> 27:26.002
Sabine's mother, Diane,also 
saw Sabine in the Beijing prison

27:26.002 --> 27:27.002
and was satisfied...

27:27.003 --> 27:30.041
Self-imolation has a 
long history in Buddhism.

27:30.041 --> 27:33.000
It's the ultimate act of 
dissent against oppression.

27:33.029 --> 27:36.091
The Vietnamese monk Quang Duc called it
"A donation to the struggle".

27:36.091 --> 27:40.055
Sabine is a peace-loving 
advocate for "Free Tibet!".

27:41.031 --> 27:43.081
This was an act of naive protest.

27:44.062 --> 27:46.067
The Government knows it. 
Everyone knows it, except

27:46.067 --> 27:48.067
the China. My daughter is no...

27:48.067 --> 27:52.067
Is there anything new here or are we
just regurgitating the press pack?

28:00.038 --> 28:02.086
Ladies and gentlemen, 
I want you to welcome

28:02.086 --> 28:06.002
the new United States 
Ambassador to Australia,

28:06.031 --> 28:08.000
Mr. Brent Moreton.

28:12.034 --> 28:14.064
Thank you very much, 
Mr. Prime Minister.

28:15.047 --> 28:17.005
I'm a simple man.

28:17.026 --> 28:20.017
I attended college on a 
football scholarship, which...

28:20.017 --> 28:22.080
probably, tells you 
just how simple.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.020
So, instead of giving a 
speech of my own invention,

28:25.020 --> 28:28.084
I will, instead, tell you what the President said to me as I was leaving.

28:29.050 --> 28:32.073
He called me into the Oval Office
 and he said to me, "Brent...

28:32.073 --> 28:34.070
"there's no greater friendship,"

28:34.085 --> 28:37.043
"no true alliance than that which exists"

28:37.060 --> 28:39.088
"between Australia and the United States".

28:40.033 --> 28:42.067
"And that's the reason why 
I'm sending you down there."

28:42.073 --> 28:44.051
"Because no matter how hard you try"

28:44.051 --> 28:46.060
"even you can't screw it up."

28:46.060 --> 28:48.060
[Laughs]

28:53.044 --> 28:54.044
Thank you.

28:56.072 --> 28:59.030
So, how are you finding
Canberra, Ambassador?

28:59.057 --> 29:00.057
Cold.

29:00.090 --> 29:01.090
Yes.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.095
You never really get used to it.

29:05.037 --> 29:07.097
Minister, this is gonna feel tropical,

29:08.009 --> 29:11.069
compared to the fuckin' freezer
 the White House is gonna put you in.

29:12.036 --> 29:14.086
News does travel fast.

29:19.086 --> 29:22.064
Congratulations on the
appointment, Ambassador.

29:23.004 --> 29:24.089
Thank you, Ambassador.

29:25.059 --> 29:27.029
My wife, Weng Meigui.

29:27.064 --> 29:29.019
It's an absolute pleasure.

29:30.064 --> 29:32.011
We haven't met.

29:32.012 --> 29:33.042
I'm Mal Paxton.

29:44.016 --> 29:46.035
GOVERNMENT STILL 
SILENT ON SABINE HOBBS

30:48.018 --> 30:51.021
So, you both sang 
with Sabine Hobbs?

30:51.085 --> 30:54.087
- Yeah, beautiful voice.
- Yes, like an angel.

30:56.077 --> 31:00.012
How do you feel about her
 20-year prison sentence?

31:02.025 --> 31:04.036
I'm sad for her family.

31:07.066 --> 31:11.031
Did Sabine have any 
involvement with dissident groups,

31:12.050 --> 31:15.051
like Falun Gong 
or Uyghurs or...

31:15.051 --> 31:17.015
or Free Tibet!,

31:17.015 --> 31:18.084
that you knew of?

31:40.020 --> 31:42.095
ANU
CHINESE CHORAL SOCIETY

32:09.040 --> 32:10.040
Hey.

32:11.087 --> 32:13.036
My body in the lake,

32:13.036 --> 32:16.056
he was in the same choir,
ANU, as Sabine Hobbs.

32:21.041 --> 32:23.051
Good days 
to the dinosaurs.

33:08.031 --> 33:09.071
Miss Dunkley.

33:11.026 --> 33:12.053
Mae Lin.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.091
You do realize that I'm not 
authorized to speak to Media

33:15.091 --> 33:18.046
- regarding Sabine Hobbs.
- Of course.

33:19.036 --> 33:23.000
I'm actually here about the Beijing Music Academy scholarship

33:23.001 --> 33:25.011
of which Sabine Hobbs 
was a recipient.

33:26.005 --> 33:27.005
Yes?

33:27.018 --> 33:30.048
I'm curious as to
 your role, Mae Lin.

33:31.093 --> 33:35.053
Do you liaise directly 
with prospective applicants?

33:35.063 --> 33:38.046
At the ANU Chinese 
Choral Society, for instance?

33:40.012 --> 33:43.046
Well, I represent the program of various educational institutions.

33:43.098 --> 33:45.018
Including ANU.

33:46.026 --> 33:48.041
Conducting information seminars,

33:49.015 --> 33:52.015
attending ceremonies 
with the Ambassador's wife

33:52.065 --> 33:55.033
- And so on.
- Do you remember meeting

33:55.034 --> 33:56.094
a Max Dalgetty?

33:58.021 --> 33:59.066
Not that I recall.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.021
Miss Dunkley.

34:22.043 --> 34:24.013
I have a meeting now.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.054
Thank you...

34:51.083 --> 34:53.018
for your time.

35:24.003 --> 35:26.028
Kim, that phone you gave me...

35:26.068 --> 35:27.098
What do you got?

35:29.051 --> 35:30.096
"Backdoor" exploit.

35:31.091 --> 35:33.051
Pretty sophisticated.

35:36.060 --> 35:37.090
Untraceable.

35:41.057 --> 35:43.072
Can you permanently delete it?

35:44.093 --> 35:45.099
Yes.

36:28.015 --> 36:29.015
Harry.

36:29.097 --> 36:31.077
Someone saw us, yesterday.

36:32.018 --> 36:34.068
There's surveillance footage.

36:34.068 --> 36:36.063
Yeah, but everybody 
knows about us, Kim.

36:36.063 --> 36:39.080
- It's in all of your disclosures.
- This is a serious warning.

36:39.080 --> 36:42.064
Do you think someone is closing ranks to cover an Agency fuck-up?

36:42.064 --> 36:44.099
As long as you are following Dalgetty,
we cannot meet,

36:44.099 --> 36:47.024
we cannot speak,
we cannot have any contact

36:47.024 --> 36:50.058
and if you so much as breathe the words
"Intelligence Sources",

36:50.058 --> 36:52.003
I'll lose my job.

36:52.028 --> 36:54.048
But you haven't 
given me anything, Kim.

36:55.061 --> 36:59.038
Yeah, I don't want to end up in a Russian share-house with Edward Snowden.

37:03.039 --> 37:05.039
Can I have my phone?

37:07.082 --> 37:10.064
- Did you get the photo back?
- No, I couldn't find it.

37:10.064 --> 37:12.064
Expert job.

37:17.057 --> 37:18.092
You lie so well.

37:19.096 --> 37:22.070
Anyone would think that 
you've had years of practice.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.085
Hi.

38:43.018 --> 38:44.018
Hey.

39:14.022 --> 39:17.042
Harriett had Max Dalgetty's 
photo on her phone.

39:17.095 --> 39:19.015
From the lake.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.091
Really?

39:21.055 --> 39:22.082
Someone hacked in.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.000
What?

39:27.001 --> 39:30.056
If Dalgetty is an Agency fuck-up,
it's a pretty big one.

39:32.027 --> 39:35.010
That would explain why 
Vaughn is so worked up.

39:37.037 --> 39:39.054
I saw him today, Dalgetty.

39:41.005 --> 39:43.094
Sliced opened while he was 
still alive, the Pathologist said.

39:45.010 --> 39:47.085
Whatever he 
swallowed, they got it.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.058
Was he on the radar?

39:50.064 --> 39:52.001
No. He is down, though.

39:52.001 --> 39:53.095
Beijing made sure of that.

39:55.020 --> 39:57.040
Aw, that's not 
exactly a good look.

39:59.009 --> 40:01.016
Letting MSS run 
around Canberra,

40:01.016 --> 40:04.076
wacking off an ANU student
on our soil.

40:05.073 --> 40:09.028
We should be taking a hard look at our friend from the Embassy.

40:09.056 --> 40:12.069
She is running someone,
Dancer, she has to be.

40:12.094 --> 40:15.025
All our protocols
have been timed

40:15.081 --> 40:19.055
And still there are things that China knows, that it has no right to know.

40:21.024 --> 40:24.034
Unless they have a 
high-level sleeper.

40:59.004 --> 41:02.004
If you're looking at porn, 
I'm gonna be offended.

41:02.087 --> 41:05.047
I'm looking through
 that list that you've e-mailed.

41:05.068 --> 41:08.046
Searching the Faculty
 records for students

41:08.046 --> 41:10.041
in the Chinese Choral Society.

41:14.004 --> 41:17.041
Kevin Dang, I know him. 
He is in my Computer Science II.

41:20.070 --> 41:23.046
There's no record 
of a Max Dalgetty.

41:24.088 --> 41:26.093
He's never been 
enrolled in ANU.

41:35.030 --> 41:36.085
You're off so soon?

41:38.087 --> 41:42.079
I guess I'll see you next time you're feeling lonely and desperate.

41:43.076 --> 41:46.017
Than I guess I'll see you soon.

42:23.097 --> 42:24.099
The...

42:25.026 --> 42:27.046
Dalgetty investigation 
has been shut down.

42:28.057 --> 42:29.057
Shut down?

42:30.050 --> 42:32.062
Any particular reason?

42:32.067 --> 42:34.048
Inter-Agency matter.

42:54.071 --> 42:55.081
What have we got?

42:58.061 --> 43:00.050
Lloyd Rankin, 63.

43:00.069 --> 43:01.069
Asphyxiation.

43:08.050 --> 43:10.070
Find out who he called last.

43:24.075 --> 43:25.095
Mr. Rankin?

43:26.011 --> 43:27.031
Who is this, please?

45:41.013 --> 45:42.068
I have to speak to you.

45:43.006 --> 45:44.006
Call me.

45:46.055 --> 45:48.085
Two hours later, 
Lloyd Rankin was dead.

45:50.012 --> 45:54.008
His body slowly starved 
of oxygen, on a lonely dirt track.

45:55.018 --> 45:58.058
In his final moments 
on Earth, he called you.

46:01.009 --> 46:02.011
I...

46:03.009 --> 46:05.009
was working on a story.

46:05.009 --> 46:06.014
What story?

46:07.034 --> 46:10.077
I... I wanted 
background about his time

46:10.077 --> 46:12.021
as Head of Mission

46:12.021 --> 46:15.013
at the Beijing Embassy. 
But he didn't

46:15.013 --> 46:16.048
wanna talk.

46:17.045 --> 46:19.040
It just wasn't a big deal.

46:20.080 --> 46:22.045
I have to speak to you.

46:22.073 --> 46:23.073
Call me.

46:24.014 --> 46:26.047
Sounds like it was 
a big deal to him.

46:28.041 --> 46:29.061
What's this?

46:30.038 --> 46:32.038
It's my card.

46:32.084 --> 46:35.053
The one you gave
Lloyd Rankin to keep in touch?

46:35.053 --> 46:38.028
Even though he said 
he didn't want to talk to you?

46:38.028 --> 46:39.028
Yes.

46:40.031 --> 46:43.091
So, to a rabbit hole you were leading him down, Miss Dunkley.

46:44.044 --> 46:47.084
Even if this is just a suicide,
you're implicated.

46:48.085 --> 46:50.074
Rankin was murdered?

46:51.016 --> 46:52.066
You tell me.

46:54.053 --> 46:56.033
Do I need a lawyer?

46:56.095 --> 46:58.005
You can go.

47:01.022 --> 47:02.057
I know where to find you.

47:07.028 --> 47:08.028
Right,

47:08.070 --> 47:09.070
right.

47:09.084 --> 47:10.084
Ok, well,

47:10.084 --> 47:13.005
I'm sure it's nothing
 to be worried about.

47:13.023 --> 47:14.023
And...

47:14.074 --> 47:16.064
thank you for keeping us informed.

47:17.082 --> 47:18.082
Fuck.

47:22.075 --> 47:25.056
We're still looking at 
a sizable deficit here

47:25.076 --> 47:27.051
and we can't ignore that.

47:27.075 --> 47:28.090
Sabine Hobbs.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.088
We've lost her.

47:30.088 --> 47:34.028
The Consulate had contact with her
every second day, like clockwork.

47:34.043 --> 47:38.024
Last visit was meant to be Monday,
but Consulate visits have been denied.

47:38.025 --> 47:40.084
And given Beijing's 
stands on dissidents

47:40.085 --> 47:44.018
- I've got genuine concerns for her well-being.
- Alright.

47:44.093 --> 47:45.093
Hand it to Xhing Dhao.

47:46.018 --> 47:48.058
You're gonna to brown-nose
the Ambassador, now.

47:48.095 --> 47:50.096
China is using Hobbs

47:50.096 --> 47:53.045
to drive a wedge 
between us and the U.S.

47:53.045 --> 47:55.029
We are risking the alliance

47:55.029 --> 47:57.042
for the sake of an over-entitled

47:57.042 --> 48:00.035
- attention-seeker.
- We are protecting an Australian citizen.

48:00.036 --> 48:02.039
Aw, fine rhetoric, Mal.

48:02.039 --> 48:05.014
Why don't you admit this plays 
right into your agenda?

48:05.014 --> 48:08.038
It doesn't help to start 
waving the defense stick around.

48:08.039 --> 48:10.066
Sabine Hobbs is
 between us and China

48:10.066 --> 48:13.031
and we're gonna deal
 with it, diplomatically.

48:13.087 --> 48:16.047
Call Huxley back,
tell him to put some pressure on.

48:16.047 --> 48:18.096
Find out where she is and 
why contact has been stopped.

48:18.096 --> 48:20.055
Then line up Ambassador Dhao.

48:20.055 --> 48:23.042
- We can't let this get out.
- Well, it will,

48:23.042 --> 48:26.077
as soon as her mother realizes that she can't speak to her.

48:26.094 --> 48:29.029
- When does she get back from Beijing?
- Today.

48:35.065 --> 48:36.065
Photoshop?

48:37.013 --> 48:41.008
It's genuine. I showed it to Paxton.
 He looked like he'd been punched.

48:42.089 --> 48:45.021
The only other person who 
knows about the arrest

48:45.021 --> 48:47.051
winds up conveniently dead.

48:49.096 --> 48:52.001
The whole country is in a lather,

48:52.001 --> 48:53.045
over Sabine Hobbs.

48:53.045 --> 48:56.040
China and the U.S. have 
started doing war dances,

48:56.070 --> 48:58.040
and a 20 year-old photograph

48:58.040 --> 49:01.069
of our pro-China Defense 
 Minister, suddenly turns up.

49:01.093 --> 49:03.020
I mean, the timing reeks.

49:04.042 --> 49:06.033
Max Dalgetty, gutted,

49:06.033 --> 49:08.064
the day before 
I got the photograph.

49:08.083 --> 49:11.043
And in the same 
choir as Sabine Hobbs.

49:13.013 --> 49:16.062
And linked to an employee 
of the Chinese Embassy.

49:16.093 --> 49:20.033
A woman shit-scared 
of the name Max Dalgetty.

49:23.008 --> 49:25.004
- It's a bloody long bow.
- Yeah,

49:25.004 --> 49:27.040
but there's a connection there, 
there's gotta be.

49:27.085 --> 49:30.022
If there's anything more 
behind this than jaywalking

49:30.022 --> 49:33.002
- it's a phenomenal story.
- Yeah, I know.

49:33.030 --> 49:34.050
Give it to Griff.

49:35.089 --> 49:37.090
No fuckin' way!

49:37.090 --> 49:40.079
You spent a year chasing Paxton's money in Union slash funds

49:40.080 --> 49:43.052
only to have him cleared by the Inquiry.
Now, this

49:43.052 --> 49:45.063
will look like a witch hunt.

49:47.036 --> 49:50.026
- Sabine's mom is back in the country this afternoon.
- Oh, God.

49:50.083 --> 49:53.067
Now, she has agreed to 
one interview... with you.

49:54.039 --> 49:56.073
She really liked your last article.

49:57.012 --> 49:58.076
You should have been a
 used cars salesman.

49:59.045 --> 50:02.070
You get something that gets the panters weeping into their morning Wheaties

50:03.002 --> 50:04.096
and I'll throw in a set of steak knives.

50:18.067 --> 50:19.097
Don't fuck it up!

50:25.063 --> 50:26.086
Come on, Kim.

50:27.050 --> 50:28.050
Pick up.

50:57.008 --> 50:58.008
Oh, shit.

50:58.078 --> 51:00.053
Sorry, Warrick, it's...

51:01.096 --> 51:04.082
it's the one with the extra 
underwire, I forgot...

51:07.047 --> 51:09.062
- Yeap. You're right, Kim.
- Thanks.

51:33.032 --> 51:35.055
Thomas, when you 
processed the Dalgetty file,

51:35.055 --> 51:37.030
did you print out the results?

51:39.053 --> 51:41.028
Can I have it, please?

51:42.089 --> 51:45.044
- Vaughn said Dalgetty was shut down.
- I know. Come on.

51:58.032 --> 51:59.097
There are two numbers here.

52:01.071 --> 52:03.040
It's a "dual-SIM" phone?

52:07.051 --> 52:09.081
Were either of them retrieved?

52:10.057 --> 52:12.017
Dunno of.

52:17.028 --> 52:18.088
You should shred this.

53:05.088 --> 53:06.088
Yes?

53:07.073 --> 53:08.073
Hi.

53:09.096 --> 53:11.066
I'm... I'm Harriett Dunkley,

53:13.025 --> 53:15.013
Ivy. Ivy Chen.

53:17.002 --> 53:19.062
I was hoping to 
speak to Mrs. Rankin.

53:20.022 --> 53:23.032
I met with her husband
 just before he...

53:23.060 --> 53:25.080
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

53:30.008 --> 53:32.083
Wait here, please.
I'll go check.

53:48.096 --> 53:51.077
MINING UNION OF AUSTRALIA

54:01.042 --> 54:02.079
I'm sorry.

54:02.079 --> 54:05.001
She is not able to 
speak at the moment.

54:05.022 --> 54:06.037
Of course.

54:06.083 --> 54:08.093
How did you know Mr. Rankin?

54:09.043 --> 54:12.011
Did you work with 
him in Foreign Affairs?

54:12.011 --> 54:13.076
Thank you for coming.

54:18.052 --> 54:19.053
Goodbye.

54:32.082 --> 54:36.080
If she tries to contact you again, will you let me know, please?

54:37.085 --> 54:39.080
I'll make sure she does.

54:45.041 --> 54:47.042
Ah, the data needs to 
be collected by 3pm

54:47.042 --> 54:50.044
so my people have
 time to prepare their reports.

54:54.096 --> 54:55.035
Oh shit...

54:59.078 --> 55:01.084
Yeah, look, hum... 
No, no, I'm happy to...

55:01.084 --> 55:03.045
just raise it at the 
weekly round table.

55:03.045 --> 55:04.050
Ok. Thanks.

55:10.011 --> 55:11.030
SIGNAL LOCK

55:11.031 --> 55:12.031
Yes!

55:42.038 --> 55:44.028
Hey, Thomas, can I have a word?

56:06.040 --> 56:09.035
Harriett Dunkley has 
joined the dots to Rankin.

56:11.001 --> 56:13.071
The clock is ticking on my career.

56:15.030 --> 56:17.010
You expect something from me...

56:18.069 --> 56:19.099
Where's Hobbs?

56:21.063 --> 56:23.070
Beijing can end this entire shit fight

56:23.070 --> 56:25.052
if they just send her back.

56:25.069 --> 56:28.055
Whatever Beijing is considering, 
regarding that girl,

56:28.071 --> 56:30.027
your career is...

56:30.028 --> 56:32.043
unlikely to be part 
of the deliberations.

56:34.017 --> 56:36.062
If that photograph is 
published, then...

56:36.069 --> 56:38.026
I will be sent home.

56:42.032 --> 56:45.022
At least, Perth is 
not so fuckin' cold.

56:52.085 --> 56:54.096
I can't imagine you in the sun.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.010
Too bright,

56:57.066 --> 56:58.091
too exposed.

57:01.012 --> 57:03.097
You couldn't thrive in such banality.

57:06.006 --> 57:07.081
Than you should help me.

57:23.005 --> 57:26.019
PAXTON / 
MINING UNION SLUSH FUND

57:50.077 --> 57:53.062
You've been on 
Tinder again, John?

57:56.051 --> 57:59.048
I think one of you has picked up something that doesn't belong to you.

57:59.048 --> 58:01.021
I don't know what 
you're talking about.

58:09.074 --> 58:10.074
So?

58:12.065 --> 58:15.016
I'm a fourth dan 
black belt in Aikido,

58:15.054 --> 58:17.099
I could whoop your skinny ass, 
even in these heels.

58:17.099 --> 58:19.024
Now, hand it over.

58:24.034 --> 58:26.044
Shit! That's not fuckin' Aikido!

58:26.044 --> 58:28.040
I lied. Give me the SIM.

58:37.023 --> 58:38.061
- Oh shit!
- Brutal.

58:38.061 --> 58:39.081
Hey, is he ok?

59:50.046 --> 59:52.056
Can we make it quick, Warrick?
I've got a lot on.

59:52.056 --> 59:55.001
Sorry, Kim.
I've gotta do a full search.

59:55.019 --> 59:57.088
- Full search? Why?
- Procedure...

59:59.095 --> 01:00:00.095
Vaughn.

01:00:15.013 --> 01:00:17.008
Will you take it off, please?

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:45.094
I'll need you to...

01:00:46.011 --> 01:00:47.030
just to turn and...

01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:50.005
I know what to do.

01:01:09.048 --> 01:01:10.060
Fuck you.

01:01:17.013 --> 01:01:18.033
All clear.

01:01:26.004 --> 01:01:27.014
I'm sorry.

01:01:55.023 --> 01:01:56.062
Did you find something?

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:02.043
East-West Education Fund.
Can you find out who the beneficiaries are?

01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:18.057
Lloyd Rankin was on the board of a fund, receiving Mining Union moneys.

01:02:18.084 --> 01:02:20.076
Probably, Paxton's way 
of paying him off.

01:02:20.076 --> 01:02:23.076
Keeping him quiet about 
whatever happened in China.

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:27.067
So, I was right. About Paxton 
misappropriating Mining Union funds.

01:02:27.091 --> 01:02:28.091
The whole time,

01:02:29.050 --> 01:02:31.020
I was right.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:34.065
Where's my Hobbs interview?

01:02:44.057 --> 01:02:47.012
I'll let you know as soon 
as we're ready to publish.

01:02:47.062 --> 01:02:50.066
We'll just keep the pressure on and get your daughter home.

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.066
Thank you.

01:02:52.024 --> 01:02:53.024
It's...

01:02:54.013 --> 01:02:55.093
It has been good to talk.

01:02:57.025 --> 01:02:59.070
There's one more question 
that I wanted to ask you.

01:03:08.015 --> 01:03:10.052
He was pulled out of the 
lake, 3 days ago.

01:03:11.023 --> 01:03:13.003
It wasn't an accident.

01:03:13.006 --> 01:03:14.031
I don't know him.

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:16.093
He had assumed 
somebody else's identity.

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:18.051
A boy called Max Dalgetty.

01:03:18.051 --> 01:03:20.090
I'm still trying to work out
 who he really was.

01:03:21.024 --> 01:03:23.071
But... the connection 
with the Choir,

01:03:24.086 --> 01:03:25.091
with Sabine,

01:03:27.024 --> 01:03:28.079
and murdered,

01:03:28.085 --> 01:03:31.026
that just rings 
alarm bells to me.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.019
What is it that you're asking?

01:03:35.035 --> 01:03:38.023
I wanna find out if 
Sabine knows who he really was.

01:03:44.034 --> 01:03:46.049
I have a scheduled phone call

01:03:46.049 --> 01:03:48.024
with her, in 10 minutes time.

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:51.092
- Why is it cancelled?
- I wouldn't worry, Mrs. Hobbs.

01:03:51.092 --> 01:03:55.009
- We'll ask for a reschedule.
- But it's her birthday tomorrow.

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:58.092
- Please, it's my only chance to wish her happy birthday.
- I understand your concern...

01:03:58.092 --> 01:04:01.027
- Why don't I get back to you tomorrow, than?
- But she knows

01:04:01.027 --> 01:04:03.037
I'm supposed to talk to her today.

01:04:04.043 --> 01:04:06.043
She will think I've forgotten her.

01:04:06.043 --> 01:04:08.040
I can let you know more tomorrow.

01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:10.089
I'll update you when we have more information.

01:04:09.017 --> 01:04:10.072
LAST TIME SEEN?

01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.071
Mr. Huxley, when
was the last time

01:04:13.071 --> 01:04:15.081
that someone from 
the Consulate saw Sabine?

01:04:15.081 --> 01:04:18.023
- I will see...
- She was supposed to be seen on Monday. Was she?

01:04:18.023 --> 01:04:21.043
We'll speak then, I will 
get my secretary to e-mail.

01:04:38.039 --> 01:04:39.074
How are you going, Dylan?

01:04:40.023 --> 01:04:41.023
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:04:41.061 --> 01:04:43.011
Did Mom tell you already?

01:04:43.088 --> 01:04:44.088
What?

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.025
Nothing. Nothing.

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:48.078
- Mom?
- Yes?

01:04:48.078 --> 01:04:51.061
- She's coming. 
- Dylan. Wait. What?

01:04:55.002 --> 01:04:56.082
Hi, hun, what's up?

01:04:58.001 --> 01:04:59.055
Remember when 
I started in the job

01:04:59.055 --> 01:05:02.046
and I said that we had to 
be prepared for anything?

01:05:02.046 --> 01:05:04.081
For the good, 
the bad and the ugly?

01:05:05.026 --> 01:05:06.026
Yes...

01:05:06.076 --> 01:05:10.001
Well, things are about to 
get very, very ugly.

01:05:12.094 --> 01:05:14.037
It's impressive, Mal.

01:05:14.063 --> 01:05:15.099
Even for you.

01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:17.049
Why didn't we know about this?

01:05:17.049 --> 01:05:20.000
ASIO did a full background 
but nothing came up.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.024
The polls are already 
sub-50. It's gonna kill us.

01:05:23.024 --> 01:05:25.029
You know what they're 
gonna call you, don't you?

01:05:25.045 --> 01:05:26.070
Chairman Mal.

01:05:27.012 --> 01:05:29.093
I vote Jim Gallo,
to replace Mal.

01:05:29.093 --> 01:05:31.043
He's steady, I like him.

01:05:31.043 --> 01:05:34.029
Though he'll have to get rid
 of that ridiculous massage...

01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:36.062
Someone is trying to smear Mal and they're using this to...

01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:39.006
drag us into the military 
build-up, in the South China Sea.

01:05:39.006 --> 01:05:41.042
- Doesn't that make a difference?
- Cheating on your travel allowance

01:05:41.042 --> 01:05:43.065
is a smear.
This is criminal!

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:45.067
A liar. Maybe even a traitor.

01:05:45.098 --> 01:05:47.032
If you sack me,

01:05:47.032 --> 01:05:48.059
I'll take the Left with me.

01:05:48.059 --> 01:05:52.023
And I'll say they wanted you to wear the rest of your Leadership like a crown of thorns.

01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:55.095
Don't you threaten me.

01:05:56.076 --> 01:05:59.013
You have lied by omission,
 to Parliament...

01:05:59.013 --> 01:06:00.072
and your own constituents.

01:06:00.072 --> 01:06:04.024
This is a "catastroFuck" 
of your own making!

01:06:05.019 --> 01:06:08.068
And why should I say anything to anyone, when I've done absolutely nothing wrong?

01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:11.004
If you wanna get rid of me,

01:06:11.004 --> 01:06:13.074
because I was dragged down to the Station
by Chinese Policemen

01:06:13.074 --> 01:06:16.071
who couldn't
tell one **** from another

01:06:16.085 --> 01:06:18.054
than you're the one who will suffer.

01:06:18.054 --> 01:06:19.074
You'll look weak.

01:06:19.085 --> 01:06:21.004
You'll look disloyal.

01:06:21.046 --> 01:06:24.001
A leader who wouldn't give 
one of his own a fair go.

01:06:24.001 --> 01:06:26.004
And that's un-bloody-Australian.

01:06:26.004 --> 01:06:27.096
We're never getting injunction.

01:06:28.032 --> 01:06:30.083
- The photo is gonna get out.
- Than we let it get out.

01:06:31.017 --> 01:06:33.052
When we tell the truth, 
there's nothing to it.

01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:36.017
You'll talk to Dunkley?

01:06:36.017 --> 01:06:38.056
Harriett Dunkley doesn't 
care what the real story is.

01:06:38.056 --> 01:06:41.079
She just wants to see me 
fall from a great height. No.

01:06:42.005 --> 01:06:44.089
Put it out through someone else, 
before she gets the chance.

01:06:44.089 --> 01:06:46.093
I could get it to Arnold Bennet.

01:06:46.093 --> 01:06:50.005
He would know he was being taken for 
a ride, if you gave him a token yourself.

01:06:50.005 --> 01:06:53.026
No one is getting taken for a ride, 
we're just giving someone the facts.

01:06:53.091 --> 01:06:55.054
It's an absurd idea.

01:06:55.055 --> 01:06:57.004
It's bold, alright.

01:06:57.039 --> 01:06:58.065
You know what, Mal?

01:06:58.091 --> 01:07:01.058
The rest of your 
faction are bed-wetters.

01:07:01.058 --> 01:07:04.009
Running on *** 
and fellow-feeling.

01:07:04.009 --> 01:07:07.028
But you've got guts. 
I'll say that for you.

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:10.051
We're gonna have 
to take some action.

01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:12.075
Alright. Let's do it.

01:07:18.043 --> 01:07:20.007
Even if..

01:07:20.007 --> 01:07:23.021
- this saves his job...
- And that's a big "if".

01:07:23.021 --> 01:07:25.072
What's the American 
response gonna be?

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.006
A Defense Minister,

01:07:28.039 --> 01:07:32.019
who seems to be under 
the thumb of Beijing, for 20 years?

01:07:32.052 --> 01:07:35.002
Possibly, doing their bidding.

01:07:35.098 --> 01:07:38.073
That photograph is gonna come out, whether we want it or not.

01:07:40.024 --> 01:07:43.092
Show the U.S. we're not letting a panda call the shots.

01:07:44.001 --> 01:07:46.026
Rescind Mal's order.

01:07:46.026 --> 01:07:49.082
Send the ANZAC 
to the Naval exercises.

01:07:50.030 --> 01:07:53.066
Then they'll know that we're 
with them, not against them.

01:07:54.055 --> 01:07:56.075
We're still negotiating Hobbs.

01:07:56.075 --> 01:07:58.099
We need to tread the middle line.

01:07:59.015 --> 01:08:00.057
Martin,

01:08:00.078 --> 01:08:02.038
I hate to sound cruel,

01:08:03.045 --> 01:08:06.028
but that poor girl is 
probably dead already.

01:08:06.029 --> 01:08:07.081
And now this.

01:08:07.081 --> 01:08:09.066
There is no line.

01:08:09.066 --> 01:08:13.012
It's disappeared from 
underneath us and we're falling.

01:08:13.012 --> 01:08:14.050
The question is...

01:08:15.018 --> 01:08:17.018
which side are we falling to?

01:08:38.026 --> 01:08:39.026
Hello?

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:44.041
Kim?

01:08:44.062 --> 01:08:46.010
Harriett called.

01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:48.090
She said to meet her in 15 minutes,
or she would set up camp in the foyer.

01:08:49.033 --> 01:08:51.013
Oh Jesus, she never lets up!

01:08:58.089 --> 01:09:00.069
Are you trying to 
land us both in jail?

01:09:00.073 --> 01:09:02.058
Did you hear about Lloyd Rankin?

01:09:03.041 --> 01:09:06.024
- 'Cause I think it's my fault he's dead.
- You can't know that for sure.

01:09:06.024 --> 01:09:09.048
Well, the Police have insinuated as much and that's the problem, I don't...

01:09:10.011 --> 01:09:11.082
I don't know for sure.

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:12.095
Come here.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:19.024
I'm sorry, Harry.

01:09:22.013 --> 01:09:23.015
Thank you.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:26.024
Are you okay?

01:09:31.075 --> 01:09:33.084
Can you just look at this for me?

01:09:33.084 --> 01:09:36.099
- No. You're unbelievable.
- Just take a look... Listen, Kim.

01:09:37.033 --> 01:09:38.037
Please.

01:09:39.069 --> 01:09:40.099
Take a look.

01:09:43.087 --> 01:09:45.078
Do you know who
 these people are?

01:09:46.006 --> 01:09:47.057
It's...It's connected to...

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:49.077
- Sabine Hobbs, Max Dalgetty, the body...
- Harriett.

01:09:49.077 --> 01:09:51.015
- in the lake.
- Can you leave it?

01:09:51.015 --> 01:09:54.002
This stuff needs to be 
handled by the Agencies, ok?

01:09:54.002 --> 01:09:56.062
You only ever see tiny 
pieces of the puzzle.

01:09:56.062 --> 01:09:58.075
And even when you put
 all those pieces together...

01:09:58.075 --> 01:10:00.041
you still only got one part.

01:10:00.041 --> 01:10:02.018
You never see the whole picture.

01:10:02.018 --> 01:10:03.086
Now, whoever gave you this

01:10:03.086 --> 01:10:06.030
has taken an enormous risk.

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:08.027
Kim, what do you know about...?

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:13.040
That's all you care about, isn't it?

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:14.040
The story.

01:10:16.067 --> 01:10:19.025
Well, that's 'cause
 it's all I've got, Kim.

01:10:19.067 --> 01:10:22.048
Even if I don't have the luxury
 of seeing the big picture.

01:10:23.049 --> 01:10:25.013
How is that working out for you?

01:10:25.038 --> 01:10:28.085
Just defending the Nation.
Everything was cracked up to be, or is it just...

01:10:28.086 --> 01:10:32.049
- one compromise after another?
- Harry, don't start with me...

01:10:32.050 --> 01:10:33.061
with your bullshit,

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:36.090
about journalism being about truth and democracy in action!

01:10:36.091 --> 01:10:39.067
'Cause what you do has 
nothing to do with either!

01:10:39.067 --> 01:10:42.040
You don't even care about the story. You just care that you got it.

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:46.018
You just care that your name 
is on the front fuckin' page!

01:10:50.098 --> 01:10:52.003
Fuck you.

01:11:23.015 --> 01:11:24.015
Dancer,

01:11:24.081 --> 01:11:26.077
I ran it through face recognition.

01:11:26.077 --> 01:11:29.050
It's Zheng Xiao, 
Minister of State Security.

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:31.065
He must be here 
under a false name.

01:11:32.022 --> 01:11:34.048
Half the Chinese 
micher are MSS.

01:11:34.074 --> 01:11:37.067
Yeah, well, this one is responsible for the torture and disappearance

01:11:37.067 --> 01:11:40.007
for at least a dozen
 Falun Gong, worldwide.

01:11:40.007 --> 01:11:41.045
He's vicous.

01:11:41.046 --> 01:11:43.069
You could move to expel him.

01:11:43.069 --> 01:11:47.004
But then that wouldn't go too well with your Minister, or the rest of the Government.

01:11:47.004 --> 01:11:50.031
- right in the middle of a diplomatic shit-fight.
- He's following Harriett.

01:11:50.061 --> 01:11:52.016
Funckin' Dalgetty.

01:11:54.055 --> 01:11:56.010
What am I supposed to do?

01:11:56.021 --> 01:11:58.079
Pull Agency resource into
 protecting a journalist?

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.081
You're her ex. You're the one that can stop her. Get her to drop it.

01:12:02.081 --> 01:12:04.011
She won't listen to me.

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:09.035
Just..

01:12:10.007 --> 01:12:12.022
watch out for her, that's all.

01:12:12.022 --> 01:12:13.027
Please.

01:12:18.099 --> 01:12:20.017
Head Office are gonna love it.

01:12:20.034 --> 01:12:22.036
WHERE IS SABINE HOBBS?

01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:27.006
Well done, Harry.

01:12:27.058 --> 01:12:28.093
Buy you a beer?

01:12:29.026 --> 01:12:31.001
No, I'm still working.

01:14:36.098 --> 01:14:38.071
Someone is copying "Vinegar Hill".

01:15:43.010 --> 01:15:44.055
All good, Kim.

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:05.034
Kim, it's me.

01:17:05.095 --> 01:17:07.005
I'm sorry.

01:17:07.084 --> 01:17:10.014
I... I was... I was a dick.

01:17:12.048 --> 01:17:14.067
Can you call me back when you get this?

01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.085
Hi, it's Harriett.

01:17:26.092 --> 01:17:28.072
I wanted to ask you something.

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:38.057
I'm tempted to put the cuffs on you.

01:17:43.047 --> 01:17:44.082
Can we not do this?

01:17:45.087 --> 01:17:47.088
I'd like to keep it straight forward.

01:17:49.064 --> 01:17:51.019
Straight forward in what way?

01:17:51.055 --> 01:17:54.092
You give me information in exchange for the information I give you?

01:17:56.033 --> 01:17:59.079
Are you planning on retiring as a Senior Constable, Brimmer?

01:18:01.034 --> 01:18:02.094
Not if I can help it.

01:18:04.045 --> 01:18:06.015
I wanna know about Rankin.

01:18:10.001 --> 01:18:11.086
I wanna know if there...

01:18:12.061 --> 01:18:15.028
were any anomalies in the evidence.

01:18:15.063 --> 01:18:16.063
If...

01:18:17.066 --> 01:18:19.076
there's anything to suggest that...

01:18:19.089 --> 01:18:21.048
it wasn't a suicide.

01:18:23.033 --> 01:18:27.019
What, is this the part where you tell me you know someone who might have wanted him dead?

01:18:28.012 --> 01:18:31.005
Cops are generally interested
 in that kind of stuff.

01:18:32.087 --> 01:18:34.022
I don't know yet.

01:18:35.069 --> 01:18:36.079
And when you do?

01:18:38.082 --> 01:18:40.024
You'll be the first to know.

01:18:40.068 --> 01:18:44.004
See, the problem with straight forward is that it's never anything more than superficial.

01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:48.016
But that's the way I like it.

01:19:58.075 --> 01:20:00.095
- Hello?
- Get in here, Harry.

01:20:01.010 --> 01:20:03.040
Arnold Bennet has run with the Paxton arrest.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.040
What?

01:20:07.022 --> 01:20:08.088
Jesus Christ, Felix,

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:10.054
it's 7:30,

01:20:10.054 --> 01:20:13.096
- why didn't you wake me?
- I thought you needed to rest.

01:20:17.004 --> 01:20:19.025
I say you're a criminal, 
what do you say to that?

01:20:19.076 --> 01:20:22.006
- I say nothing, Ludie.
- Correct.

01:20:22.079 --> 01:20:26.038
You're a puppet in a fascist state.
You lied to the public,

01:20:26.057 --> 01:20:28.025
covered up to save your own ass,

01:20:28.025 --> 01:20:31.011
threatened national security
what do you say to that?

01:20:31.011 --> 01:20:32.011
Nothing.

01:20:37.062 --> 01:20:39.077
It's gonna be a lot worse for
 you out there than that.

01:20:39.089 --> 01:20:43.024
I wouldn't skimp on the deodorant. You're gonna fuckin' need it!

01:20:51.059 --> 01:20:55.007
Feverish speculation
of the emergence of a photo

01:20:55.007 --> 01:20:56.014
of Paxton arrested in...

01:20:56.014 --> 01:20:57.096
The Hobbs' exclusive 
has been held over.

01:20:57.096 --> 01:21:00.099
- Management didn't want to compete with this.
- Do I still get my steak knives?

01:21:00.099 --> 01:21:04.099
- You're needing something to stick into me?
- I would if I could, but I am a little too busy.

01:21:05.012 --> 01:21:06.054
A lot of cathing up to do.

01:21:08.056 --> 01:21:11.091
Here's the East-West 
education beneficiaries' list.

01:21:38.078 --> 01:21:39.078
Ivy Chen,

01:21:40.031 --> 01:21:43.026
- You're a legend.
- Morning meeting, people, let's go to it, come on.

01:21:45.004 --> 01:21:46.004
Paxton.

01:21:46.033 --> 01:21:49.050
What have we got?
Not enough at the moment, it seems... So,

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:52.008
Chinese contacts, e-mail,

01:21:52.025 --> 01:21:54.056
coal write, 
if you have to, ok?

01:21:54.067 --> 01:21:56.068
I want results and I want 
them no, so move!

01:21:57.032 --> 01:21:59.042
Can you dig up 
Australian Consulate staff?

01:21:59.042 --> 01:22:00.080
- I'll do it.
- Possibly expelled.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.004
Embattled Defense 
Minister, Mal Paxton,

01:22:03.004 --> 01:22:06.068
defiantly ran the media *** to enter Parliament, this morning.

01:22:06.068 --> 01:22:08.033
It's worse than we thought.

01:22:09.052 --> 01:22:13.052
Political graveyards are full of people who were loyal to idiots.

01:22:17.053 --> 01:22:20.024
I'll announce his resignation 
at the press conference.

01:22:20.046 --> 01:22:21.046
And...

01:22:22.018 --> 01:22:24.094
I'm sorry, Sir, but the 
Chinese Ambassador is on the line.

01:22:25.014 --> 01:22:27.074
- I thought you met yesterday.
- We did.

01:22:29.015 --> 01:22:31.040
- What does he want?
- I don't know, Sir,

01:22:31.051 --> 01:22:33.031
but he says it's important.

01:22:35.098 --> 01:22:39.096
An error on the part of an always zealous Beijing Police Officer.

01:22:40.096 --> 01:22:42.099
A question of mistaken identity,

01:22:42.099 --> 01:22:45.007
as Mr. Paxton has said.

01:22:46.007 --> 01:22:49.017
I'ts a very simple matter. 
There was no cover-up

01:22:49.017 --> 01:22:50.088
because there was nothing to hide.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:57.010
Harriett Dunkley, from the Daily Nation.

01:22:57.023 --> 01:22:58.064
Where's Sabine Hobbs?

01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:03.020
Contact with her mother and the Consulate has been cut off

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:05.016
in direct contravention
 of arrangement,

01:23:05.016 --> 01:23:08.030
- so, where is she? What's happened to her?
- Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

01:23:08.051 --> 01:23:10.049
That was the last question.
 Thank you.

01:23:11.031 --> 01:23:14.019
And that's the real story.
You were played, Arnie.

01:23:21.087 --> 01:23:24.041
I wanted to let you know 
I'm rescinding your decision.

01:23:24.066 --> 01:23:28.020
The ANZAC is going to the South China Sea,
joining the military exercise.

01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:30.042
You said you weren't gonna take sides.

01:23:30.042 --> 01:23:33.044
- I've been forced to.
- We can't look like Chinese stooges.

01:23:33.044 --> 01:23:35.099
Beijing is gonna view this 
as deliberately provocative.

01:23:35.099 --> 01:23:39.097
And if this continues to escalate, I want you to take a long hard look in the mirror

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.079
to see who's responsible.

01:23:41.079 --> 01:23:44.016
I'm fucked if I know how 
you've pulled it off, Mal!

01:23:45.021 --> 01:23:48.089
And you just salvage the job as nothing more than a sign on your door.

01:23:49.006 --> 01:23:51.084
From this day onwards,
 every Defense decision

01:23:51.084 --> 01:23:53.069
goes through me.

01:23:58.018 --> 01:24:00.030
Gallery has already 
christened you "Teflon Mal".

01:24:00.047 --> 01:24:04.041
If you people want something to stick thin, you better throw something with a little more substance.

01:24:04.041 --> 01:24:06.056
But I am interested in 
who gave you that photograph.

01:24:06.056 --> 01:24:07.064
Aw, I can't tell you that.

01:24:07.064 --> 01:24:10.023
- Maybe now you'll get off my back.
- Hey, where is Ivy Chen?

01:24:11.065 --> 01:24:15.007
How do you explain the relationsip between you, Lloyd Rankin and Ivy Chen?

01:24:15.030 --> 01:24:18.040
Why were Mining Union funds used to pay for her schooling?

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:20.066
Almost two hundred
 thousand dollars.

01:24:21.051 --> 01:24:24.018
What happened to 
Lloyd Rankin, Minister?

01:24:43.049 --> 01:24:45.079
Thank you, "Vinegar Hill".

01:25:09.056 --> 01:25:13.011
- It's just for a short time, Ivy.
- But why do I have to go?

01:25:31.091 --> 01:25:34.096
- Aw, Kim, I'm so glad you called.
- I'm in trouble, Harry.

01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:37.059
What? Ok, I'm coming over.
Where are you? At home?

01:25:37.059 --> 01:25:40.053
- No, no. No, not there..
- Where?

01:25:41.049 --> 01:25:44.023
That hike we went on 
when you pulled your calf muscle.

01:25:44.036 --> 01:25:46.019
Where we... 
Where we stopped for lunch.

01:25:46.019 --> 01:25:47.042
And I need money.

01:25:47.042 --> 01:25:49.078
As much as you can get. 
What's your limit?

01:25:49.078 --> 01:25:52.026
- Five thousand?
- Ok, Kim, what's happening? Why do you need money?

01:25:52.026 --> 01:25:53.047
Can you get it or not?

01:25:53.048 --> 01:25:55.003
Yeah, I can... I can get it.

01:25:55.087 --> 01:25:57.026
I'm leaving now.

01:25:57.091 --> 01:25:59.041
It's my fault.

01:25:59.041 --> 01:26:01.079
What's your fault, Kim?
 You're scaring me.

01:26:01.079 --> 01:26:03.034
I should have worked it out.

01:27:10.038 --> 01:27:12.033
Kim, its Harriet. Hum...

01:27:14.016 --> 01:27:18.011
Can you call me when you get this? 'Cause I'm... I'm starting to get kind of worried.

01:27:21.052 --> 01:27:24.090
You've reached Harriett Dunkley.
I can't take your call right now. Leave...

01:27:34.028 --> 01:27:36.024
You have one new message.

01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:37.076
Harriett, listen...

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:40.003
Remember the "shared house"?

01:27:40.024 --> 01:27:41.044
You were right.

01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:44.030
You were right about a lot of things.

01:28:24.091 --> 01:28:25.091
Shit.

01:28:52.083 --> 01:28:56.055
Head of Domestic Intelligence can't spy on his own wrist watch.

01:28:58.004 --> 01:29:00.020
- Sorry, I'm late.
- Not a problem.

01:29:02.002 --> 01:29:05.000
- We didn't get the result we were looking for?
- Hum, same result...

01:29:05.024 --> 01:29:07.024
just by a more circuitous route.

01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:08.068
Meaning?

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:12.008
Take a ticket for a 
ringside seat, gentlemen.

01:29:12.017 --> 01:29:15.026
Toohey is sending our boys over to join the military exercises.

01:29:15.026 --> 01:29:17.041
We're taking the fight to Beijing.

01:29:18.059 --> 01:29:22.042
- Sting like a bee.
- Sting like a motherfuckin' boxed jellyfish.

01:29:24.088 --> 01:29:26.098
Ahh, let me break the good news.

01:29:27.036 --> 01:29:29.043
- Ambassador.
- Madam Attorney.

01:29:29.085 --> 01:29:31.021
- General.
- Ambasador.

01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:32.061
Mr. Willer.

01:30:58.029 --> 01:31:01.071
How long do we have to maintain this illusion?
She is blind, not stupid.

01:31:16.048 --> 01:31:18.045
She was found at Mount Pleasant.

01:31:18.045 --> 01:31:20.017
Next to her car.

01:31:20.060 --> 01:31:23.001
It doesn't make any sense, 
because that's...

01:31:23.011 --> 01:31:26.003
- it's a long way from our meeting place.
- Maybe she took a detour.

01:31:26.003 --> 01:31:28.065
I mean, she was scared, though.
It was the whole point of the meeting.

01:31:28.065 --> 01:31:30.050
You don't have to do this now 
if you don't feel up to it.

01:31:30.050 --> 01:31:31.097
No, I wanna go in.

01:32:56.074 --> 01:32:59.051
Transcript and Sync:
Babochka

01:33:00.041 --> 01:33:02.060
"Secret City" continues Sunday, 8h30...

01:33:05.004 --> 01:33:07.070
I want to know the truth, Het.

01:33:08.063 --> 01:33:11.002
I'm gonna find out what happened.

01:33:11.083 --> 01:33:14.024
Nothing stays hidden in this town for long, Liz.

01:33:16.014 --> 01:33:19.064
Your Government is doing everything it can to aggravate China.

01:33:19.064 --> 01:33:21.023
You're making things worse.

01:33:21.024 --> 01:33:22.092
This is a bill for a police state.

01:33:22.092 --> 01:33:25.087
And you is the big fat 
spider in the center of it.

01:33:26.028 --> 01:33:27.072
Even the police don't have a clue.

01:33:28.039 --> 01:33:29.097
They really think it was me.

01:33:29.097 --> 01:33:32.044
You might find yourself in need of a friend.

01:33:32.087 --> 01:33:35.055
- I think I can crack this.
- No.

01:33:35.098 --> 01:33:38.020
What does Beijing want in return for Sabine?

01:33:38.020 --> 01:33:40.005
Whatever it is, you can't give.

01:33:40.005 --> 01:33:41.088
If Australia ends up in conflict,

01:33:41.098 --> 01:33:43.004
you won't last long.

01:33:43.035 --> 01:33:45.044
I'm maybe the only friend you have left.

01:33:45.068 --> 01:33:47.011
Well, than I'm in trouble.

01:33:47.078 --> 01:33:50.014
I wan to speak to my daughter!
