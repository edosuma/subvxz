13:40.653 --> 13:45.819
Fl\/E YEARS AGO, THERE VVERE
NO HOVVLS IN THE HERMITAGE.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.036
THERE WAS SIMPLY
THE BOMBED-OUT RUIN

13:48.119 --> 13:52.329
OF AN OLD CASTLE BELONGING
TO THE FAMILY WOLFEN.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.282
BARON WOLFEN GAVE IT
TO THE BROTHERHOOD OF TRUTH

13:55.376 --> 13:56.958
AS A GESTURE OF CHARITY.

13:57.045 --> 13:59.787
OUR JOB WAS
TO TEND THE VINEYARDS

13:59.881 --> 14:03.795
AND SAVE WHAT SOULS WE COULD
BY CONSTANT PRAYER.

14:03.885 --> 14:07.344
BUT THIS ISN'T A RELIGIOUS
ORDER, IS IT, BROTHER?

14:07.430 --> 14:10.138
<i>WE FEEL THAT WE ARE
RECOGNIZED BY GOD.</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:12.477
<i>TRUTH IS OUR DOGMA.</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:15.018
WE BELIEVE IT TO BE
MAN'S GREATEST WEAPON

14:15.104 --> 14:20.019
AGAINST THE DE\/IL, VVHO
IS THE FATHER OF ALL LIES.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.770
ALL RIGHT, GO ON
WITH YOUR STORY.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.647
YOU WERE TENDING
THE VINEYARDS.

14:23.738 --> 14:26.696
AT THAT TIME, SHORTLY
AFTER THE GREAT VVAR,

14:26.783 --> 14:28.649
THE WORLD
WAS IN CHAOS.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.825
EVERYWHERE
WAS UNHAPPINESS

14:30.912 --> 14:34.155
EXCEPT IN THIS
LITTLE VILLAGE BELOW.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.161
FOR SOME REASON, THE
PEOPLE OF SOHVVARTZVVALD

14:37.251 --> 14:38.833
REFUSED TO YIELD
TO DESPAIR.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.082
THEY LOST NONE
OF THEIR FAITH.

14:41.172 --> 14:44.710
THEY CONTINUED AS THEY
HAD BEEN FOR CENTURIES.

14:44.801 --> 14:49.090
HONEST, GOD-FEARING
AND HAPPY.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.171
THIS VILLAGE WAS
A PLUM TO SATAN

14:51.265 --> 14:54.303
ONE HE COULD NOT RESIST,
SO HE CAME HERE

14:54.394 --> 14:56.635
AND EMBARKED UPON A
PROGRAM OF CORRUPTION!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.060
BUT YOU
STOPPED HIM.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.434
YES!

15:00.525 --> 15:02.812
YOU SEE,
MR. ELLINGTON,

15:02.902 --> 15:06.065
HE MADE THE SAME MISTAKE
THAT <i>YOU</i> HA\/E MADE.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.362
HE UNDERESTIMATED ME.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.565
HE THOUGHT HE WOULD
HAVE NO DIFFICULTY

15:10.660 --> 15:12.526
IN TEMPTING
THE OLD FOOL.

15:12.620 --> 15:16.113
BUT I HAD HIM IN A CELL BEFORE
HE KNEVV VVHAT HAPPENED.

15:16.207 --> 15:19.074
BUT IF HE'S THE DE\/IL, HOVV
DO YOU KEEP HIM LOCKED UP?

15:19.168 --> 15:21.910
WITH THE STAFF OF TRUTH!

15:22.004 --> 15:25.247
THE ONE BARRIER
HE CANNOT PASS.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.503
TELL ME, HOW DID
YOU RECOGNIZE HIM?

15:27.593 --> 15:29.334
HE DOESN'T LOOK EVIL.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.593
THE DEVIL HATH POWER
TO ASSUME A PLEASING SHAPE.

15:33.683 --> 15:37.893
I HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE
IN ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD,

15:37.979 --> 15:42.098
IN ALL FORMS AND GUISES,
WHEREVER THERE WAS SIN

15:42.191 --> 15:44.649
<i>WHEREVER THERE WAS STRIFE</i>

15:44.735 --> 15:48.854
<i>WHEREVER THERE WAS
CORRUPTION, PERSECUTION,</i>

15:48.948 --> 15:51.030
THERE HE WAS ALSO.

15:51.117 --> 15:55.532
SOMETIMES HE VVAS ONLY A
SPECTATOR, A FACE IN THE CROVVD,

15:55.621 --> 16:00.411
BUT ALWAYS HE WAS THERE.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.333
<i>NOW,</i>

16:02.420 --> 16:05.287
YOU SEE, I HOPE,
WHY YOU MUST SAY NOTHING

16:05.381 --> 16:08.544
OF WHAT YOU'VE SEEN
AND HEARD HERE.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.636
BROTHER, IT'S NOT
THAT I DOUBT YOU

16:13.723 --> 16:15.714
YOU UNDERSTAND,
ONLY ISN'T IT POSSIBLE

16:15.808 --> 16:17.310
YOU MIGHT HAVE
MADE A MISTAKE?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.509
NO! THINK,
MR. ELLINGTON.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.686
THINK OF THE PEACE
OF THE WORLD

16:21.772 --> 16:23.183
THESE LAST FIVE YEARS.

16:23.274 --> 16:25.231
THINK OF
THIS COUNTRY NOW.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.900
IS THERE
ANOTHER LIKE IT?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.818
YOU HAVEN'T PUT
AN END TO SUFFERING.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.771
THERE'S STILL
MURDERS, ROBBERIES.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.106
WHILE WE'RE TALKING,
PEOPLE ARE STARVING.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.784
THE SUFFERING MAN
WAS MEANTTO ENDURE.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.237
WE CAUSE MOST
OF OUR OWN GRIEFS.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.072
WE NEED NO HELP
FROM HIM.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.123
IT IS THE UNNATURAL
CATASTROPHES,

16:42.210 --> 16:44.952
THE GREAT WARS, THE
OVERWHELMING PESTILENCES

16:45.046 --> 16:49.290
THE WHOLESALE SINNING
THAT WE HAVE STOPPED.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.049
YES.

DOUBTFUL AT FIRST,

16:57.391 --> 16:59.678
BUT YOU'VE CONVINCED
ME, ABSOLUTELY.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.806
I PROMISE TO KEEP
YOUR SECRET.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.682
GOOD, MY SON.

17:03.773 --> 17:06.231
TOMORROW, IF YOU
FEEL WELL ENOUGH,

17:06.317 --> 17:08.604
YOU MAY LEAVE.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.276
