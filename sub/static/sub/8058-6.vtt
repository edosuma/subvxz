WEBVTT

00:02.101 --> 00:04.830
Are you getting ready
with Andy in London?

00:04.950 --> 00:06.087
You look lovely.

00:06.121 --> 00:07.555
I'm going to murder you
a thousand times.

00:07.573 --> 00:08.906
Okay.

00:08.957 --> 00:11.692
What the hell?

00:11.727 --> 00:16.514
♪ Someone's back from London,
no, it's not the queen ♪

00:16.548 --> 00:20.134
♪ someone's back from London,
it's not Mr. Bean ♪

00:20.169 --> 00:21.652
Oh, my God.

00:21.703 --> 00:24.238
♪ It's not the royal baby,
I think his name is Jeff ♪

00:24.256 --> 00:26.057
Stop singing!
Kiss me!

00:26.091 --> 00:28.676
Oh, my God!
What are you doing here?

00:28.694 --> 00:30.111
Just missed you so bad, honey,

00:30.145 --> 00:32.046
I bought myself a ticket home.

00:32.080 --> 00:36.050
You're never gonna need
that computer again

00:36.084 --> 00:38.385
'cause I'm home for,
like, 19 hours.

00:38.403 --> 00:40.654
This is so sweet.
Just like the old days.

00:40.672 --> 00:42.340
Take a hike, Jerry.

00:42.391 --> 00:44.275
It's Larry now.

00:44.309 --> 00:45.693
Okay, take a hike, Larry.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:05.430 --> 01:06.981
Next order of business,

01:06.999 --> 01:10.735
Councilman Jamm
proposes Bill 949-c.

01:10.769 --> 01:12.253
That's right, stretch,

01:12.287 --> 01:14.622
and looking mighty fly
in that suit, brother.

01:14.656 --> 01:15.957
Okay, this excellent bill
only allows

01:15.991 --> 01:18.125
someone to vote
in a Pawnee election,

01:18.143 --> 01:21.045
for example,
the upcoming recall election,

01:21.079 --> 01:23.848
if their I.D. lists
an official Pawnee address.

01:23.899 --> 01:26.267
Really, councilman?
Again?

01:26.301 --> 01:27.585
The recall election
is coming up,

01:27.619 --> 01:30.154
and Jamm keeps trying to figure
out ways to screw me over.

01:30.188 --> 01:32.673
Last week, he tried to have me
listed on the ballot

01:32.691 --> 01:35.343
as "Leslie Buttface Hitler
the Fourth."

01:35.377 --> 01:36.844
All you're trying to do
is disenfranchise

01:36.878 --> 01:38.562
the people
from former Eagleton,

01:38.597 --> 01:40.347
people who will most likely
vote for me

01:40.365 --> 01:41.666
because I saved
a lot of their jobs.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.284
I move that we table
the discussion

01:43.302 --> 01:44.302
until after the election.

01:44.353 --> 01:45.286
- Second.
- Thank you!

01:45.320 --> 01:46.354
- Ah!
- I'm so sorry.

01:46.388 --> 01:49.040
I just get excited
when you like me.

01:49.091 --> 01:52.093
I put my career on the line
by saving Eagleton,

01:52.127 --> 01:53.828
and he's trying
to rob me of their votes?

01:53.862 --> 01:54.912
Those are my votes.

01:54.947 --> 01:56.580
I've earned them!
I want them!

01:56.632 --> 01:57.648
Give me those votes!

01:57.683 --> 01:59.400
I don't have them on me.

01:59.434 --> 02:01.302
I can't believe Jamm
tried to pull that crap.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.620
I can.
He's a horrible monster.

02:02.654 --> 02:04.071
But let's focus on
the more important issue.

02:04.089 --> 02:06.307
You want to squeeze in
one more practice session?

02:06.341 --> 02:09.143
Oh, do I?

02:09.161 --> 02:11.395
Tonight, I am throwing Ben
his dream birthday party,

02:11.430 --> 02:14.615
a roller skating bash
with an early '90s theme.

02:14.650 --> 02:16.734
Ben lives for the early '90s.

02:16.785 --> 02:18.786
The music, the fashion.
It's his favorite era.

02:18.820 --> 02:21.455
As for the roller skating--

02:21.473 --> 02:23.524
I have a thing
for women in skates. Okay?

02:23.558 --> 02:25.293
Everyone has a thing,
and that's mine.

02:25.327 --> 02:27.712
As far as things go,
it's pretty innocuous.

02:27.746 --> 02:31.432
Could be one of those dudes that
kisses mannequins or whatever,

02:31.466 --> 02:34.485
but I like a woman in skates.

02:34.519 --> 02:36.554
A lot.

02:36.588 --> 02:39.974
Hey, Ann, Ann called.

02:40.008 --> 02:42.443
She wants her ugly outfit back.

02:42.461 --> 02:43.911
Why are you dressed
as a pilgrim?

02:43.929 --> 02:46.480
Leslie said it was a "Come
As You Were in the '90s" party.

02:46.515 --> 02:48.182
I assumed it was the 1690s.

02:48.216 --> 02:50.951
Babe, if it was the 1690s,
we'd all be mummies.

02:50.985 --> 02:53.220
What do you think mummies are?

02:53.254 --> 02:54.221
Skeletons?

02:54.255 --> 02:55.573
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.

02:55.607 --> 02:57.691
I just came straight from work,
so I couldn't dress up.

02:57.709 --> 02:59.149
No problem.
You look wiggidy-wiggidy-

02:59.161 --> 03:00.561
wiggidy-wiggidy-wonderful.

03:00.595 --> 03:01.795
Wait a minute.
Pants on backwards.

03:01.813 --> 03:04.999
Kris Kross, right?
Nice!

03:05.033 --> 03:06.450
What happens when
you have to pee?

03:06.501 --> 03:07.752
I actually just went.

03:07.803 --> 03:09.420
I had to pull my pants
all the way to the ground

03:09.471 --> 03:10.654
like a toddler.

03:11.857 --> 03:13.607
Nadia, the super hot doctor,

03:13.625 --> 03:15.109
has been hanging out with me
for the last week.

03:15.127 --> 03:17.228
She's definitely
out of my league.

03:17.262 --> 03:19.430
Actually, we're not even
playing the same sport.

03:19.481 --> 03:21.365
It's kind of like she's in NBA

03:21.416 --> 03:23.667
and I work at a muffler store
next to the stadium.

03:23.702 --> 03:24.668
I can't believe we met
just before

03:24.720 --> 03:25.920
you have to go
on your stupid vacation.

03:25.954 --> 03:28.155
I'm doing doctors
without borders, man.

03:28.190 --> 03:29.457
I'm going to Rwanda.

03:29.491 --> 03:32.159
Exactly.
That's a stupid vacation.

03:32.193 --> 03:34.812
Okay, well, why don't you
win me that huge-ass bear

03:34.846 --> 03:36.313
as a going-away present?

03:36.348 --> 03:37.365
No problem.
I'm a skee ball master.

03:37.399 --> 03:39.250
No way!
Why don't you go pro?

03:39.284 --> 03:41.052
I don't know.
I didn't want to be a cliche.

03:41.086 --> 03:43.320
Yet another professional
Indian skee ball player?

03:43.355 --> 03:44.304
Right.

03:47.793 --> 03:50.043
Now that's what
I call shooting.

03:50.062 --> 03:51.479
Is this a hunting game?

03:51.513 --> 03:52.530
Yeah, it's fun.
You want to play?

03:52.581 --> 03:53.914
Indeed, I do.

03:53.948 --> 03:57.251
If you'd like,
I could offer you some pointers.

03:57.269 --> 03:59.320
Hunting, Donna,

03:59.354 --> 04:02.923
is about silence,
balance, and patience.

04:04.342 --> 04:05.643
Get ready.

04:09.064 --> 04:12.850
You know you're supposed
to hit the deer, rig?

04:12.884 --> 04:15.469
Ugh!

04:15.487 --> 04:16.771
Get it together, Swanson.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.406
Well, the game is absurd.

04:18.440 --> 04:20.307
This gun is lightweight,
there's no sight,

04:20.341 --> 04:22.142
and we are far too close
to these deer.

04:22.177 --> 04:23.844
Would they not smell us?

04:23.878 --> 04:25.913
I want my money back.
How do I get my quarters?

04:25.947 --> 04:27.981
Oh, my God!
You are such a sore loser.

04:27.999 --> 04:28.959
I am not a sore loser.

04:28.967 --> 04:30.167
It's just that I prefer to win,

04:30.168 --> 04:32.269
and when I don't,
I get furious.

04:32.304 --> 04:34.054
Employee!

04:35.690 --> 04:37.475
Whoa! Watch this.

04:37.509 --> 04:38.826
Oh, that was brilliant.

04:38.860 --> 04:40.794
Sorry. You probably
don't know what that means.

04:40.812 --> 04:42.630
You know how you Americans say
"cool" when something's cool?

04:42.664 --> 04:45.065
Over in London, we say,
"That's brilliant."

04:45.083 --> 04:46.367
Speaking of London,

04:46.401 --> 04:47.868
you haven't told me
anything about work.

04:47.886 --> 04:49.526
- You still love it?
- Yeah, it's awesome.

04:49.554 --> 04:50.971
I'm kicking ass.

04:50.989 --> 04:53.273
I'm like Chuck Norris,
only instead of crushing

04:53.291 --> 04:57.878
bad guys' skulls,
I'm crushing documents.

04:57.912 --> 04:59.213
- that's great.
- Yeah.

04:59.231 --> 05:01.048
Now be the Chuck Norris
of making out with me.

05:01.066 --> 05:04.184
I'll karate punch your face
with my tongue.

05:04.202 --> 05:07.505
- Prove it.
- Hi-yah.

05:07.556 --> 05:09.073
Get this.

05:09.107 --> 05:11.325
I just asked the DJ
what rem albums he has.

05:11.359 --> 05:15.296
He's got <i>Monster,</i> but not
<i>Automatic For the People.</i>

05:15.330 --> 05:17.314
- Wow!
- I know.

05:17.349 --> 05:18.899
It's like, what is this?
A mid-'90s party?

05:18.934 --> 05:20.634
No.
It's an early '90s party.

05:20.652 --> 05:22.486
Okay, Larry.
Tell us how this looks.

05:22.537 --> 05:24.305
Ben wants to do
a synchronized couple skate

05:24.339 --> 05:25.506
to <i>Losing My Religion.</i>

05:25.540 --> 05:26.474
Hit it!

05:30.445 --> 05:32.913
Leslie!
Leslie! Leslie!

05:32.948 --> 05:34.715
I'm sorry,
but we have a problem.

05:34.749 --> 05:36.467
His name is Jeremy Jamm.

05:36.518 --> 05:37.768
Well, as noted in Article
nine, Paragraph two--

05:37.819 --> 05:39.236
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

05:39.287 --> 05:41.121
Jamm, I thought
this bill was tabled?

05:41.155 --> 05:44.041
Yes, and I called a special
session and un-tabled it.

05:44.092 --> 05:46.310
What's up with the roller skates?

05:46.361 --> 05:48.696
I was about to attend
a roller skating birthday party

05:48.730 --> 05:50.597
for my husband,
but this is more important.

05:50.615 --> 05:52.583
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm a blades guy.

05:52.617 --> 05:53.751
Point of order!

05:53.802 --> 05:55.419
The councilwoman
wishes to speak on this issue.

05:55.470 --> 05:57.504
Will the councilwoman
yield her time

05:57.522 --> 05:58.772
so we can vote on this sucker?

05:58.807 --> 06:00.774
No, I will not yield.

06:00.808 --> 06:03.627
Nor will I yield
for the rest of the evening.

06:03.662 --> 06:04.728
A filibuster?

06:04.763 --> 06:06.714
Are you dookin'
on my chest right now?

06:06.748 --> 06:08.749
No! Gross!

06:08.783 --> 06:10.384
And yes, it's a filibuster.

06:10.418 --> 06:11.552
Okay?

06:11.586 --> 06:12.920
I am not willing
to let you deprive me--

06:12.954 --> 06:14.989
She's filibustering
on roller skates?

06:15.023 --> 06:17.474
She's gonna be strapped
into those things for hours.

06:17.509 --> 06:19.009
I know this
is a dire situation,

06:19.060 --> 06:20.261
but I swear to God,
this is like

06:20.295 --> 06:22.346
a crazy sex fantasy for me.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.118
How goes it?

06:32.358 --> 06:35.060
Pretty good,
except I suck at skee ball.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.812
Well, that's too bad, 'cause
if you don't win me that bear,

06:36.846 --> 06:37.979
you're dead to me.

06:38.014 --> 06:39.415
Understood.

06:39.535 --> 06:41.415
Hey, man, how many tickets
for that bear, again?

06:41.426 --> 06:44.778
- 40,000.
- 40,000? Oh, brother.

06:44.812 --> 06:48.715
All right, you're gonna be
my lookout for a second.

06:48.750 --> 06:50.183
Hey, is he allowed to do that?

06:50.218 --> 06:51.852
No!
Get off the ramp, dude!

06:51.903 --> 06:54.121
Hey! You're supposed
to be my lookout.

06:54.172 --> 06:55.922
I thought it'd be funnier
to watch you get busted.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.191
Hey, you're a doctor.
You know snitches get stitches.

06:59.193 --> 07:00.994
I remember
the first time I voted.

07:01.029 --> 07:03.563
I was in my bedroom,
and I was five.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.916
I voted for Mildred,
my stuffed pig,

07:05.950 --> 07:08.085
but my cat, pancakes, won.

07:08.119 --> 07:09.452
She had more funding.

07:09.470 --> 07:12.339
Politics, right?
What are you gonna do?

07:12.373 --> 07:13.740
How long have I been talking?
Three hours?

07:13.775 --> 07:14.858
No, eight minutes.
Okay.

07:14.876 --> 07:16.826
Maybe you should
yield the floor.

07:16.844 --> 07:17.894
Milton doesn't
have a lot of time--

07:17.929 --> 07:19.262
left on earth.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.864
Hey, just kidding, bud.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.716
Will someone open my crackers?

07:22.750 --> 07:23.700
The session ends
at 11:00 P.M.

07:23.718 --> 07:25.986
She has to talk the whole time.

07:26.020 --> 07:27.871
She can't lean on anything
for support,

07:27.939 --> 07:29.573
and no one else can help her.

07:29.607 --> 07:31.391
Three strikes and she is done.

07:31.426 --> 07:32.943
This is literally

07:32.977 --> 07:34.611
the most exciting thing
that I've ever seen.

07:34.645 --> 07:35.579
I mean, think about it.

07:35.613 --> 07:36.763
Where else on earth
would you rather

07:36.798 --> 07:38.114
spend your birthday
with Leslie?

07:38.132 --> 07:39.966
Well, maybe the birthday party

07:40.001 --> 07:42.185
she's throwing for me
right now.

07:42.203 --> 07:45.055
Everyone in Pawnee
should have the right to vote.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.056
Whoa!

07:46.090 --> 07:48.058
As I dissect this important

07:48.092 --> 07:49.543
and profound statement,

07:49.577 --> 07:50.710
I'm just gonna
take these off for a second.

07:50.745 --> 07:53.513
Bam, strike one.
No sitting.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.117
Is the gong really necessary?

07:57.151 --> 07:59.569
Yes, it is.
I love Chinese crap.

07:59.587 --> 08:02.105
Lucy Liu, Nintendo,
Gangnam Style,

08:02.140 --> 08:04.507
sushi, et cetera, et cetera.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.376
Also, more importantly,
it's in the rules. No sitting.

08:06.411 --> 08:07.627
Okay, fine.

08:07.662 --> 08:08.795
Well, the strike is worth it
if I can take these off.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.580
Oh, man!

08:10.598 --> 08:12.599
Oh, my God!

08:12.650 --> 08:16.036
I had this exact bear
when I was a kid!

08:16.070 --> 08:17.487
- Excuse me.
- Uh-huh.

08:17.505 --> 08:18.889
How much does this bear cost?

08:18.923 --> 08:20.807
40,000 tickets.

08:20.842 --> 08:22.526
Okay, well, let's
just assume that I'm an adult

08:22.560 --> 08:25.045
who doesn't have two weeks
to play arcade games.

08:25.079 --> 08:27.581
What about 50 bucks?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.182
Yeah.
Just don't tell my boss.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.378
- What are you doing, Morris?
- Nothing, Mr. Bonderman.

08:31.402 --> 08:34.121
- Tuck in your shirt. God!
- Sorry.

08:34.172 --> 08:36.690
Oh! You feeling it?

08:41.345 --> 08:42.578
Wow.
You suck at this.

08:42.597 --> 08:45.015
Donna, please back up two paces

08:45.049 --> 08:47.250
so I can physically
destroy this machine.

08:47.285 --> 08:50.770
Can you chill a little, man?
It's not real hunting.

08:50.805 --> 08:52.055
It's just a game.

08:52.089 --> 08:53.170
That you happen to suck at.

08:53.191 --> 08:55.325
You know what?
That's a good point.

08:55.359 --> 08:56.960
What?
That you suck at this?

08:56.994 --> 09:00.263
That it's not re hunting.
Come with me.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.868
I don't want you
to go back to London.

09:04.902 --> 09:06.942
Just remember, every time
you look up at the moon,

09:06.971 --> 09:09.973
I, too, will be
looking at a moon.

09:09.991 --> 09:12.108
Not the same moon, obviously.
That's impossible.

09:12.126 --> 09:14.794
See you on stupid Skype.

09:17.231 --> 09:19.282
I'm proud of Andy.

09:19.317 --> 09:22.302
This is the first time
he's really gone out on a limb.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.138
I knew if he found something
that he actually liked doing,

09:25.173 --> 09:28.158
he'd be happy, so I'm--

09:30.127 --> 09:32.162
What the hell?
Wha--

09:32.196 --> 09:36.065
Hey! Perkins!
What are you doing with my bear?

09:36.083 --> 09:37.083
I've been playing skee ball
for, like, two hours

09:37.118 --> 09:38.168
trying to win that for Nadia.

09:38.202 --> 09:39.753
I just bought it for 50 bucks.

09:39.804 --> 09:40.904
When I was a kid,

09:40.938 --> 09:43.139
I taught myself
how to make out on this bear,

09:43.157 --> 09:44.674
pretended it was cockroach
from The Cosby Show.

09:44.709 --> 09:48.094
Hey, what's going on here?
Why does blossom have my bear?

09:48.145 --> 09:50.864
I bought it for myself,
but apparently,

09:50.898 --> 09:52.465
he was trying to win it
for you, so I'm sorry.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.616
I still got
some tickets, though.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.719
I could get you, uh,
a ninja turtle balloon

09:55.753 --> 09:57.938
or <i>Cliffhanger</i> on VHS.

09:57.972 --> 09:59.739
Oh, that's so sweet,

09:59.790 --> 10:01.625
but you're basically
offering me garbage.

10:01.659 --> 10:04.561
Let's just skate.

10:04.595 --> 10:06.515
That bear was the only thing
she was gonna have

10:06.531 --> 10:07.781
to remember me by in Rwanda.

10:07.832 --> 10:10.333
And if I know anything
about Rwanda, and I don't,

10:10.367 --> 10:11.685
I bet it's full of rich guys

10:11.719 --> 10:13.186
who'll buy her
whatever she wants.

10:18.309 --> 10:21.995
Hunting.
No quarters required.

10:22.029 --> 10:24.280
Hang on.

10:24.298 --> 10:25.966
Do you have a license
to hunt at night?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.852
'Cause you need a license.

10:35.860 --> 10:38.078
I thought you were serious.

10:38.112 --> 10:41.264
Come on now.
You know I don't give a [bleep].

10:41.299 --> 10:42.549
As Ronald Reagan would say,

10:42.583 --> 10:47.420
"Well, mommy, I believe
voting rights are important."

10:47.455 --> 10:49.339
Does anyone else
think it's hot in here?

10:49.373 --> 10:50.873
These overalls
are really starchy.

10:50.891 --> 10:53.143
Yeah, maybe that's 'cause
I turned up the heat to 90,

10:53.177 --> 10:55.829
and, uh, oh, the knob
broke off in my hand.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.998
Oops.

10:58.049 --> 11:00.267
Well, speaking of heat,

11:00.301 --> 11:02.769
we should discuss
America's white-hot passion

11:02.820 --> 11:04.554
for voting rights
and the men and women

11:04.589 --> 11:05.538
who help protect them,

11:05.590 --> 11:07.340
like the local
city councilwoman

11:07.391 --> 11:09.726
who is starving and thinking
about her husband's

11:09.760 --> 11:11.261
<i>Reservoir Dog-</i> themed
birthday cake

11:11.295 --> 11:12.228
and wanting to eat it
really badly.

11:12.262 --> 11:14.080
Oh, this is not a good sign.

11:14.115 --> 11:16.533
Once she starts
thinking about birthday cake,

11:16.567 --> 11:19.836
she's basically useless
until she eats birthday cake.

11:19.854 --> 11:21.804
Democracy is not unlike a cake.

11:21.822 --> 11:24.624
It's layered, delicious,
chocolate, and I want some.

11:24.675 --> 11:25.642
Okay, she's fading.

11:25.676 --> 11:27.477
Ben, we need to find
a way to smuggle

11:27.511 --> 11:30.363
some mineral oil drops
onto her tongue.

11:30.414 --> 11:32.332
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Excuse me.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.816
What the hell
are you people doing here?

11:33.834 --> 11:36.119
We represent the citizens
of former Eagleton.

11:36.137 --> 11:37.654
We're here to support
Leslie Knope

11:37.688 --> 11:39.412
for preserving
our voting rights.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.723
Thank you!

11:40.741 --> 11:43.493
You are all warriors
of democracy.

11:43.527 --> 11:47.180
You know, it was the first mayor
of Pawnee, in 1817,

11:47.214 --> 11:50.233
who said, "All we have
is the right to vote

11:50.267 --> 11:52.085
and the right to kill Indians
without consequence."

11:52.119 --> 11:54.554
And I believe that half
of that statement

11:54.605 --> 11:55.772
is still true today.

11:58.409 --> 11:59.359
All right!

11:59.410 --> 12:02.245
Second wind!

12:02.279 --> 12:04.964
Andy, I know you're in there.

12:05.016 --> 12:07.984
Andy, come on.

12:09.870 --> 12:12.339
Oh, hey.

12:12.373 --> 12:14.474
I was just--

12:14.508 --> 12:17.277
just here in this dumpster
'cause I jumped in.

12:17.328 --> 12:19.663
Get out!
We need to talk.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.581
About what?

12:21.615 --> 12:26.336
Fresh air, real weapons,
an honest kill.

12:26.370 --> 12:30.540
There is no substitute
for the real thing.

12:32.460 --> 12:34.611
You want to go back and play
that video game, don't you?

12:34.645 --> 12:38.014
Yes! Damn it!

12:38.048 --> 12:41.401
It is so inspiring
to see Eagletonians

12:41.452 --> 12:43.370
putting aside their prejudices.

12:43.404 --> 12:45.488
With support like this,
Leslie Knope

12:45.522 --> 12:47.790
may stand a fighting chance
on recall day.

12:47.808 --> 12:50.760
- Permission to hug you.
- Granted.

12:50.794 --> 12:52.779
I should mention, though,

12:52.813 --> 12:54.314
that we're not voting
to keep Leslie.

12:54.365 --> 12:56.066
What?

12:56.100 --> 12:57.400
We want someone from Eagleton

12:57.434 --> 12:59.902
to represent our interests
on the new city council.

12:59.920 --> 13:02.238
Sir, I formally revoke our hug.

13:02.256 --> 13:04.007
Well, you can't.
It happened.

13:04.041 --> 13:07.544
We stand on the side
of Rosa Parks,

13:07.578 --> 13:10.747
and Gandhi, and Team Aniston.

13:10.765 --> 13:13.016
One small vote for Pawnee

13:13.050 --> 13:16.803
is one giant leap
of voting for mankind.

13:16.854 --> 13:18.271
Hey!

13:18.305 --> 13:20.473
Hey, you're not allowed
to receive help from the crowd.

13:20.524 --> 13:23.226
That's strike two.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.228
Hey, man, leave my gong alone.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.563
The reverb is the best part.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.281
If I save your right to vote,

13:28.315 --> 13:30.617
you're gonna vote
for someone from Eagleton?

13:32.436 --> 13:34.930
Eagleton! Eagleton!

13:35.487 --> 13:36.923
Hey, Knope! Wrap it up!

13:37.043 --> 13:37.951
I'm not gonna yield.

13:38.071 --> 13:39.975
I just--I need some time to think.

13:40.009 --> 13:42.878
And because I must keep talking,
I'm gonna think out loud.

13:42.912 --> 13:46.365
Okay, if Eagletonians
vote for someone else,

13:46.399 --> 13:50.130
then it would be in my
best interest to stop, right?

13:50.465 --> 13:51.439
So they can't vote.

13:51.559 --> 13:53.861
Uh, da-doy.
Yield.

13:53.981 --> 13:55.966
Or I keep going,

13:56.086 --> 13:59.216
because the right to vote
is fundamental in any democracy,

13:59.327 --> 14:01.127
and this is bigger than me
or anyone.

14:01.162 --> 14:02.963
I don't care if I lose.

14:02.997 --> 14:05.148
No one prevents people
in my town from voting.

14:05.182 --> 14:06.416
Not on my watch.

14:06.450 --> 14:08.418
The filibuster is on!

14:08.452 --> 14:10.470
Yeah!

14:10.504 --> 14:11.771
Okay.

14:11.806 --> 14:12.956
I can't go back to London.

14:12.990 --> 14:16.076
I'm totally in over my head
on this project.

14:16.110 --> 14:17.560
Every day, someone
comes up to me and says,

14:17.595 --> 14:19.729
"I need your approval
on this, Mr. Dwyer."

14:19.780 --> 14:21.331
"I need your signature,
Mr. Dwyer."

14:21.382 --> 14:22.615
"That's not a toilet,
Mr. Dwyer."

14:22.633 --> 14:24.985
But you said everything
was going awesome.

14:25.019 --> 14:26.619
You said you
were like Chuck Norris.

14:26.654 --> 14:28.154
I am, but I'm
like Chuck Norris now--

14:28.172 --> 14:31.024
some old guy with a beard
who used to be good at karate

14:31.058 --> 14:32.976
but became a dumb has-been

14:33.010 --> 14:36.096
and is scared and confused
about his big London job.

14:36.130 --> 14:37.313
Okay.

14:37.348 --> 14:39.499
The parallels between
he and I are very eerie.

14:39.533 --> 14:41.968
I'm gonna tell you a secret
about everyone else's job.

14:42.003 --> 14:43.386
Okay.

14:43.437 --> 14:45.155
No one knows
what they're doing.

14:45.206 --> 14:48.174
I don't know how to run
an animal control department.

14:48.209 --> 14:50.193
Half the documents I get
I put right into the shredder

14:50.227 --> 14:51.528
because they're so boring.

14:51.562 --> 14:53.613
But you seem like you
do know what you're doing.

14:53.647 --> 14:54.881
Yeah, I seem like it.

14:54.915 --> 14:57.350
Deep down,
everyone is just faking it

14:57.368 --> 15:00.470
until they figure it out.

15:00.504 --> 15:02.405
And you will too,
because you are awesome

15:02.440 --> 15:05.391
and everyone else sucks.

15:05.409 --> 15:09.679
- 30 minutes to go.
- Oh, God, it's so hot.

15:09.714 --> 15:11.781
Almost as hot as the flames

15:11.816 --> 15:14.084
that Eagleton
would have gone down in

15:14.135 --> 15:15.535
if I had not saved them.

15:19.973 --> 15:21.591
Mm, mm, mm.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.344
- That's--
- How I know you would love

15:24.378 --> 15:27.914
an ice-cold frozen marg.

15:27.948 --> 15:30.050
All I want
is the promise of democracy.

15:30.084 --> 15:31.184
Sure about that?

15:31.218 --> 15:33.236
- I want that marg.
- I know you do.

15:33.287 --> 15:35.538
- I want that Margarita.
- Oh, it's gonna be so good.

15:35.589 --> 15:37.323
So cold.
It's so cold.

15:37.341 --> 15:39.943
- I want to drink it.
- Make that heat go away!

15:39.977 --> 15:42.579
Come on, get!

15:42.613 --> 15:44.130
Come on, girl.
Get!

15:44.165 --> 15:46.049
Give me that Margarita!

15:46.100 --> 15:49.369
No!
I want votes.

15:51.956 --> 15:54.707
Excuse me, worker,

15:54.725 --> 15:56.809
bring me a bucket of beers
and four hot dogs.

15:56.827 --> 15:57.810
Please, and thank you.

15:57.828 --> 15:59.829
Why are you covered in blood?

15:59.880 --> 16:01.798
Don't worry.
It's not human.

16:01.849 --> 16:04.100
I hope you've made peace
with your God,

16:04.151 --> 16:06.152
small electronic deer.

16:06.187 --> 16:08.121
Kill it.

16:08.155 --> 16:09.939
Ann, I need that bear.

16:09.974 --> 16:11.724
I got to give Nadia
something awesome

16:11.758 --> 16:13.276
so she'll remember me
when she's in Africa.

16:13.310 --> 16:17.213
Tom, bear or no bear,
she clearly likes you.

16:17.264 --> 16:19.599
Actually, how do you even
get girls like her--

16:19.633 --> 16:21.184
or me--
to go out with you?

16:21.218 --> 16:22.852
Scientists say
the emotions of love and hate

16:22.903 --> 16:23.970
are very close to each other.

16:24.004 --> 16:25.171
That's what I tell women.

16:25.206 --> 16:27.423
The point is,
she's leaving in two days.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.476
You want her to remember you?

16:29.510 --> 16:30.477
Go spend time with her

16:30.511 --> 16:32.328
and do something
memorable, dummy!

16:32.363 --> 16:33.797
Thanks, Ann.

16:33.831 --> 16:35.448
I know conversations
like this are hard for you

16:35.466 --> 16:36.966
'cause you still
have feelings for me,

16:37.001 --> 16:38.601
but you'll land
on your feet, kid.

16:38.652 --> 16:41.171
- Run or I punch you.
- No punchies!

16:42.373 --> 16:45.091
Okay, bye for real this time.

16:48.061 --> 16:49.329
Wait, wait, wait.

16:49.363 --> 16:51.047
I made you five bologna
sandwiches

16:51.098 --> 16:52.482
in case you get hungry
on the way to the airport.

16:52.516 --> 16:53.599
Did you--

16:53.617 --> 16:55.118
Yes, I used cookies
instead of bread.

16:55.152 --> 16:57.253
You think of everything.
I love you.

16:57.288 --> 16:59.589
Love you too.

17:04.478 --> 17:06.779
Are you kidding me?

17:06.797 --> 17:09.799
- Andy!
- Ha! Ha! Found it!

17:09.849 --> 17:12.351
I got--I left my wallet
in here earlier, I guess.

17:12.368 --> 17:14.537
Whoo! All good now.

17:14.588 --> 17:16.454
Ooh, look!
Noodles!

17:16.473 --> 17:18.808
No, no, no, babe.
Babe, don't touch those.

17:18.858 --> 17:20.443
I've read the entire charter.

17:20.477 --> 17:23.563
There's no other way
to get her a bathroom break...

17:23.597 --> 17:27.366
unless we bring
the bathroom to her--

17:27.384 --> 17:28.384
that's nothing.

17:28.419 --> 17:29.936
I mean,
she's not gonna make it.

17:29.970 --> 17:32.472
Look at her, she's dancing
around like she's a character

17:32.506 --> 17:34.140
in one of those
<i>Peanuts</i> cartoons.

17:34.175 --> 17:37.493
Okay,
in these last few minutes,

17:37.545 --> 17:41.714
I would like to talk about
the voting rights act of 1968

17:41.748 --> 17:44.851
while clenching every muscle
in my body.

17:44.885 --> 17:46.019
Sound good?

17:46.053 --> 17:48.221
Hey, Knope,
how you feeling over there?

17:48.255 --> 17:50.240
You go pee-pee?
Pee-pee times?

17:50.291 --> 17:51.574
Make wee-wee?

17:51.625 --> 17:52.575
Ten more seconds.

17:52.626 --> 17:56.963
Four, three, two, one!

17:56.997 --> 17:59.865
This session is adjourned.

17:59.884 --> 18:01.968
All pending matters are tabled.

18:02.002 --> 18:05.638
Yes!

18:05.673 --> 18:07.390
- You were amazing.
- I love you, but move!

18:07.424 --> 18:08.541
I have to go
to the whiz palace.

18:08.559 --> 18:09.542
Oh, wait!

18:09.560 --> 18:11.177
Eagleton! Eagleton!

18:11.211 --> 18:15.431
Oh!
My beautiful curls!

18:15.482 --> 18:16.882
She didn't have time to hug me,

18:16.901 --> 18:18.268
but she could do that?

18:19.927 --> 18:23.258
Hey, Ann, can I talk to you
for a second? About Tom?

18:23.378 --> 18:24.212
Sure.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.760
You guys look like
you're having fun.

18:25.781 --> 18:27.056
Yeah, no, I really like him.

18:27.090 --> 18:29.609
I just wanted to say that
I think you're really cool,

18:29.643 --> 18:31.990
and the fact that Tom dated you

18:32.110 --> 18:33.527
makes me think
he's a really good guy.

18:33.562 --> 18:35.863
That's so sweet.

18:35.897 --> 18:38.566
Oh, okay.

18:38.600 --> 18:39.567
Wha--what are you--

18:39.618 --> 18:41.018
- What the hell?
- Now!

18:41.036 --> 18:42.286
Sorry, Ann, this is on you.

18:42.320 --> 18:43.068
You told us to make a memory.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.022
- There's your money back.
- Let go!

18:45.040 --> 18:48.025
Suck it!

18:48.043 --> 18:50.027
This is $8!

18:50.045 --> 18:52.379
- Man, that was so much fun.
- Yeah.

18:52.414 --> 18:54.531
Together,
we truly did steal a toy

18:54.549 --> 18:56.133
from your pregnant friend.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.586
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Mm-hmm.

18:58.637 --> 19:01.972
I know we just met, like,
two weeks ago and whatever,

19:02.007 --> 19:04.308
but is there any chance maybe,

19:04.342 --> 19:05.643
when you get back,
we can maybe--

19:05.677 --> 19:08.212
Ugh. Clingy.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.547
Oh, no. Sorry.
No, no, no, no.

19:10.565 --> 19:12.549
I'm kidding.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.068
Of course I'll call you
when I come back.

19:14.102 --> 19:16.437
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.273
So long, suckers!

19:19.324 --> 19:20.908
Hey! Quick!

19:24.679 --> 19:25.746
Ooh!

19:25.780 --> 19:26.780
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

19:26.832 --> 19:28.282
Now that's what I call shooting.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.834
- Come on!
- That's a new record!

19:29.868 --> 19:30.868
Hey!
Look at that!

19:30.902 --> 19:33.170
You finally made it
in the top 10.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.455
Now you can
enter your initials.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.790
My initials are private.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.094
Then just put in
any three letters.

19:44.466 --> 19:46.100
Ass.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.089
Oh, my God!
That was epic!

19:52.107 --> 19:53.307
I was peeing so freakin' hard,

19:53.358 --> 19:54.775
it was like
a jacuzzi jet or--

19:54.809 --> 19:56.944
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hey! Ingrid!

19:56.978 --> 19:59.363
I wasn't talking
about the velocity of my pee

19:59.397 --> 20:01.157
because you are a very smart
and classy lady.

20:01.199 --> 20:03.600
Ben, you remember
Ingrid de Forest

20:03.618 --> 20:05.035
from the former Eagleton.

20:05.070 --> 20:07.288
Yes, she was just telling me
she's been nominated

20:07.322 --> 20:09.990
to run against you
in the recall.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.276
Wow.
Buzz kill.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.128
I know you must hate me
right now, Leslie,

20:14.162 --> 20:15.880
and that's justified,

20:15.914 --> 20:19.383
but I need to thank you
for what you just did in there.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.001
Not the forceful urination.
The filibuster.

20:21.052 --> 20:22.303
Right, yeah.

20:22.337 --> 20:25.956
It was incredibly courageous,
and it was selfless.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.291
And if I do win,

20:27.309 --> 20:29.459
I'm gonna have very big
roller skates to fill.

20:29.477 --> 20:33.013
Could I take you out
for a celebratory plate of--

20:33.064 --> 20:34.315
I think you call them waffles?

20:34.349 --> 20:36.400
Wow, that is the best offer
you could ever make,

20:36.418 --> 20:39.753
but I had to miss my husband's
birthday party for this,

20:39.788 --> 20:42.006
so I think I'll be spending
the evening with him.

20:42.040 --> 20:46.076
- A rain check, maybe.
- Please.

20:46.094 --> 20:49.013
I'm sorry your birthday party
got all screwed up.

20:49.047 --> 20:50.714
Maybe I should put
those roller skates back on.

20:50.748 --> 20:51.966
Well, you must be exhausted.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.100
We don't have
to go to the party.

20:53.134 --> 20:55.102
Oh, we're not
going to the party.

20:55.136 --> 20:56.687
We're going home.

20:56.721 --> 20:59.423
Then why would you need
to put on roller...skates?

20:59.441 --> 21:01.925
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

21:01.943 --> 21:05.233
We're just--
we're just--skates...
