<i>He had a graduate degree in political
affairs and military history from Yale.</i>

01:49.583 --> 01:53.542
<i>He was both a straight-A student
and a troublemaker.</i>

01:53.625 --> 01:56.542
<i>He once famously attempted
to stick a lit cherry bomb</i>

01:56.625 --> 01:58.417

<i>and, most commonly, the Glenimal.</i>

02:19.958 --> 02:22.250
<i>He was like a throwback to another era.</i>

02:23.125 --> 02:25.500
<i>His hand was bent into a permanent claw,</i>

Ain't that right, Greg?

Yes, indeed, sir. You're very excited.

<i>He was famous for his Spartan regime
of routine and discipline.</i>

03:49.042 --> 03:53.292
<i>He ate one meal a day.
He slept four hours per night.</i>

03:53.375 --> 03:56.042
<i>He ran seven miles every morning.</i>

03:58.125 --> 04:02.458
<i>In Iraq, he transformed special operations
with what he called</i>

04:02.542 --> 04:06.458
<i>systemic negation

04:06.542 --> 04:11.083

04:11.167 --> 04:12.542
[CORY] We got Italy in there.

04:12.625 --> 04:13.750

04:13.833 --> 04:16.791
We got Poland, Macedonia, Ukraine.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.833
We got Australia over there,
Croatia, Belgium...

04:19.916 --> 04:23.625
Okay, that'll do. Bite-size chunks, hmm?
Let's knock this on the head.

04:24.542 --> 04:25.417
All right.

04:25.500 --> 04:28.875
[SEAN] <i>Basically, he was a master</i>

04:50.458 --> 04:52.625
I want to open this place up.

04:52.708 --> 04:54.500
I came in here

04:54.583 --> 04:58.542
I have only ten men
to lead here in Afghanistan, huh.

04:58.625 --> 05:02.375
So it make no sense for me
to be sit out there with everybody else.

05:02.458 --> 05:04.500
I get it. All right?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.292
But everybody has a reason
not to be out there with everybody else.

05:07.375 --> 05:10.750
Austria only has two guys here.
Iceland has seven guys.

05:10.833 --> 05:14.000
This country won't fight at night.
That country won't fight in the snow.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.500
This war's been running eight years now.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.500
President Obama, as you know,
is drawing down troops in Iraq

10:01.583 --> 10:04.417
to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.958
Henry Whelan was a good man,
he meant well,

10:07.042 --> 10:09.292
but he just wasn't getting the job done.

10:09.375 --> 10:13.708
Now, given your reputation
and your formidable drive,

10:13.792 --> 10:17.500
our hope is that you're the man
who will get the job done.

10:18.042 --> 10:21.583
First things first. We want you to make
an assessment of the situation here.

10:21.667 --> 10:23.875
Travel the country, talk to people.

10:23.958 --> 10:27.958
At the end of that assessment,
you'll tell us what needs to be done,

10:28.042 --> 10:31.875
how you're gonna get it done
and what you need in order to get it done.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.417
- So, now...
- To that end...

10:35.333 --> 10:36.625
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, you go.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.417

10:43.458 --> 10:45.042
To that end... [CHUCKLES]

10:45.125 --> 10:48.875
uh, now is probably
a good time to share with you

10:48.958 --> 10:52.708
where the president hopes
that assessment might land.

10:52.792 --> 10:55.958
Obviously, the endgame here
is to just finish this thing.

10:56.042 --> 10:58.333
So, how do we do that?

10:59.500 --> 11:02.958
- Is it by reducing our footprint here?
- [SEAN] <i>The civilian executive.</i>

- Because the United States Congress

19:47.417 --> 19:49.292

this way, General.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.208
We've been in Helmand province
for five years now,

19:52.292 --> 19:56.917
and in all that time, all we've
really managed to secure is this base.

19:57.000 --> 19:59.625
Now, you go out there, you go into Marjah,

19:59.708 --> 20:03.000
you go into Lashkar Gah,
it's all Pashtun, as you know.

This is the Taliban.

20:06.083 --> 20:09.417
We're not winning any hearts
and minds there, I can tell you that.

20:10.500 --> 20:14.083
I'm not sure we ever will.
Kandahar's the same, of course.

20:15.708 --> 20:18.458
Can I be completely frank with you, sir?

20:18.542 --> 20:21.667
If I was you, I'd cut Helmand loose.

20:22.792 --> 20:25.375
I'd concentrate
on those parts of the country

20:25.458 --> 20:28.958
that are at least, in some way,
sympathetic to the mission,

20:29.042 --> 20:31.125
and I'd cut it loose.

20:31.208 --> 20:33.292
It's a lost cause.

20:33.375 --> 20:37.500
This whole province constitutes
just 4% of the population of the country.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.542
It's strategically meaningless.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.292
It's already written. Did it last night.

22:19.750 --> 22:21.667

the trust of this country,

22:26.417 --> 22:30.417
we can't be seen to accept that there's
a whole chunk of it we can't handle.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.000
We're here to provide security.

22:33.375 --> 22:36.625

is we secure that corner of the country

we can't control.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.875

22:40.958 --> 22:42.500
I didn't come here to manage this war,

to close it out.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.708

22:48.583 --> 22:52.125
I'm taking Helmand...
then I'm taking Kandahar.

22:53.167 --> 22:54.708
What do you say to that?

22:59.667 --> 23:01.708
All right, and another thing.

23:03.083 --> 23:06.125
Being that this is
a nation-building exercise and all,

23:06.625 --> 23:09.417
seems to me it'd behoove us
to have someone in the room

23:09.500 --> 23:12.917
who's actually from the nation
we're building. Don't you think?

23:15.667 --> 23:16.875
Copy.

23:16.958 --> 23:20.833
We are here to build, to protect.

23:21.583 --> 23:25.917
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.958
We're not here to shoot first
and ask questions later.

23:29.917 --> 23:33.875
We must not be driven
by fear and suspicion.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.833
We are here, above all else...

23:41.833 --> 23:44.417
to support the civilian population.

23:44.500 --> 23:48.708
And to that end,
we must avoid killing it at all cost.

23:49.875 --> 23:54.083
Civilian casualties cannot be seen
as an unfortunate byproduct of conflict.

23:54.167 --> 23:57.833
They must be treated as errors
of the greatest consequence.

an election here is a fragile thing.

muddied by a big new American offensive.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.375

- No. No, I didn't. I...

26:37.250 --> 26:40.708

you're not gonna be 100% clear
on who the enemy is.

[CLEARS THROAT]
Well, I was just observing, sir,

37:12.708 --> 37:15.917
that, um, people don't quite
understand elections.

37:16.000 --> 37:19.708
They see that the president is alive,
everything is okay.

37:19.792 --> 37:21.792
So what's the big problem?
Why are we having an election?

37:21.875 --> 37:22.875
[GLEN] Yeah.

37:22.958 --> 37:24.417
And then you have an election anyway,

37:24.500 --> 37:27.292
and people vote for whoever
the local leaders tell them to vote for.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.375
Yeah.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.333
Because they don't want to have
their heads chopped off.

37:31.042 --> 37:32.542
See what I mean?

37:38.542 --> 37:42.583
Thank you... for that. Uh...

37:42.667 --> 37:45.792
I'm sorry, Glen.
We're going to a runoff election.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.458
[GROANS] Jesus H...

37:51.000 --> 37:55.125
I got the White House sitting on my report
till after these elections get done.

37:55.208 --> 37:59.417
I can't do anything until the president
approves my recommendations.

37:59.500 --> 38:04.458
And now you're telling me that's not gonna
be until after another goddamn election?!

38:04.542 --> 38:08.000
You need a legitimate partner here, Glen.
Karzai ain't that guy.

38:09.667 --> 38:11.125
You gotta understand,

38:11.208 --> 38:14.000
what we're trying to do here
is like raising a child.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.333
And a child needs two parents.

38:18.083 --> 38:23.458
Two parents who love it
and each other very much.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.458
That's what it needs, above all else.

38:31.417 --> 38:34.458
Well, then your wife, Mrs. Karzai...

38:34.542 --> 38:38.750
I'm assuming that you're the daddy
in this metaphorical relationship...

38:38.833 --> 38:40.375
We suspect your wife, Karzai,

38:40.458 --> 38:42.208
- might be a drug addict.

in this election

38:45.417 --> 38:47.542

a pretty vicious homosexual rumor,

38:47.625 --> 38:51.292

is a straight-up criminal warlord.

whatever it is. And seriously...

how is Washington any different, huh?

at war right now,

41:16.250 --> 41:18.708
Look, you're so good at your job,

41:18.792 --> 41:22.833

I mean, I know you have your own
world of questions to ask in there.

42:14.375 --> 42:17.292
You might wanna think about
asking the general...

42:17.375 --> 42:19.583
how much face time
he's had with the president

42:19.667 --> 42:21.333
since taking over the position.

42:22.333 --> 42:23.500
Okay.

of US forces in Afghanistan,

once in 70 days?

<i>- Bonjour,</i> General.

48:29.625 --> 48:30.833
[SIGHS] Thank you.

48:30.917 --> 48:32.833
- [GUARD] <i>Bonjour, monsieur.</i>
- Hello.

48:34.500 --> 48:36.167
[CORY] Okay, so tomorrow afternoon,

48:36.250 --> 48:38.958
you have the presentation
to l'École Militaire.

48:39.042 --> 48:42.833
Uh... Tomorrow night,
dinner with the minister of defense.

48:42.917 --> 48:44.833
That is a gala dinner, by the way.

48:44.917 --> 48:48.875
Just a heads-up so you can prepare
yourself mentally. It's a big one.

48:48.958 --> 48:51.333
Meetings the next day.
Then we got the night free.

48:51.417 --> 48:53.708
- And then to Berlin.
- [GLEN] Yeah.

48:55.833 --> 48:59.375
Here we go.
Obama is in Copenhagen tonight.

48:59.458 --> 49:01.833
They wanna know
if you can spare time for a meeting

49:01.917 --> 49:04.333
on Air Force One tomorrow morning.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.750
- The president wants some face time.
- [GREG CHUCKLES]

49:06.833 --> 49:09.958
Now he wants fucking face time.
Fucking dick.

49:11.417 --> 49:13.333
So can you do that, boss?

49:13.417 --> 49:15.833
Then we can jet across
to Copenhagen at zero six.

49:15.917 --> 49:18.792
The president's gonna be
on the tarmac at 8:30.

49:19.750 --> 49:22.917
Well, you're the keeper of my schedule,
Cory. You tell me if I can do it.

49:24.792 --> 49:28.000
Uh, okay, yeah, we can have you back
in Paris early afternoon,

49:28.083 --> 49:31.167
depending on how much time you two need.
And I can shift your morning meetings.

49:31.250 --> 49:34.375
See that out there? I'm calling that dusk.

49:34.458 --> 49:36.708
That's close of fucking business.

49:38.417 --> 49:40.083
Boss, you good with this?

49:40.167 --> 49:43.125
Sure, Pete. We're not in theater.
You boys earned it.

49:47.708 --> 49:49.792
Sir, have you had a chance
to say hello to your wife yet?

49:50.458 --> 49:51.667
You know, she checked in this morning.

49:51.750 --> 49:54.042
I think she's waiting for you
in your room.

49:54.125 --> 49:56.250
Shit. Right, I should do that.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.542
- What room am I in again?
- [ALL SPEAKING]

50:00.625 --> 50:01.917
- 517.
- What?

50:02.000 --> 50:03.375
- Five-seven-one.
- Five-one-seven.

50:03.458 --> 50:05.875
- Stop. Go.
- Five-one-seven.

50:05.958 --> 50:07.375
Five-one-seven.

- [KNOCKING ON DOOR]
- [CLEARS THROAT]

50:22.333 --> 50:24.375
- Hi, boss.
- Hey, Willy.

50:28.667 --> 50:30.000
[SIGHS]

50:30.083 --> 50:33.083
- Hi. Hi, honey.
- Hi.

50:33.167 --> 50:34.458
- Hi.
- Huh.

50:35.125 --> 50:36.958
I'm sorry, I've been delayed.

50:38.708 --> 50:41.458
The president is wanting time
with me tomorrow,

50:41.542 --> 50:43.167
and we've been trying to ascertain

50:43.250 --> 50:47.708
whether... whether or not
we can accommodate this request.

50:49.083 --> 50:51.208
- I'm gonna leave you two be. I'll be...
- [CLEARS THROAT]

50:51.292 --> 50:54.250
- I'll be right next door.
- Okay, thank you, Willy.

50:54.333 --> 50:55.500
[SIGHS]

51:02.958 --> 51:06.125
[SIGHS] Well, we're in Paris.

51:06.208 --> 51:09.625
Yeah... Hopefully we'll get to see
some sights.

51:09.708 --> 51:14.875
Yeah, I'll have, uh,
Cory, uh, schedule some time.

51:14.958 --> 51:15.958
- Yeah.
- Okay,

51:16.042 --> 51:18.208
but you do what you gotta do,
because I am here for you.

51:18.292 --> 51:19.292
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

51:22.750 --> 51:25.208
- How's Tim?
- Oh, he's good. He's good.

51:25.292 --> 51:26.958
- He sends his love.
- Okay.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.750
Um... He's...
He's got a new girlfriend now.

51:29.833 --> 51:31.667
- Ooh!
- Yeah, I like her.

51:31.750 --> 51:34.500
Yeah, her daddy's an ILE instructor
over at Leavenworth.

51:34.583 --> 51:35.667
- Huh.
- Mmm-hmm.

51:35.750 --> 51:38.542
Yeah, she's sweet. You'll like her.

51:42.542 --> 51:43.625
Hmm.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.458
Well...

51:54.042 --> 51:57.958
Well, I... I think it's just great you're
getting to see the president, honey.

51:59.792 --> 52:01.667
You must be very excited, huh?

52:38.250 --> 52:39.833
[PAT] Hey, Glen.

52:40.500 --> 52:44.083
Hope you don't mind me hitching a ride.
I'm on my own dash to see the president.

52:44.167 --> 52:45.833
They told me you were heading
over there this morning.

52:48.208 --> 52:50.750
No problem, Pat. My plane is your plane.

52:51.708 --> 52:54.292
- Knock yourself out.
- Thanks, Glen.

52:54.375 --> 52:57.458
So my hope is, depending on how long
your meeting goes with the president,

52:57.542 --> 52:59.875
we can have you back in Paris NLT 1400,

52:59.958 --> 53:02.042
then straight to
the École Militaire for 1500.

53:02.125 --> 53:04.375
My uniform will be crushed
after these flights.

53:04.458 --> 53:06.042
I'll need a shower, a fresh shave.

53:06.125 --> 53:08.125
I'm allowing for four solid hours
with the president.

53:08.208 --> 53:10.417
If it's less than that,
we should be fine to go via the hotel.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.625
I am just contingency planning
for the possibility

53:12.708 --> 53:14.083
we may be running tight on time.

53:14.167 --> 53:15.917
- Can we move the École Militaire back?
- Not really.

53:16.000 --> 53:17.000
Gonna be a lot of people there.

53:17.083 --> 53:19.875
We have the gala dinner right after.
We don't have any wiggle room here.

53:19.958 --> 53:22.375
[GREG] You should wear the fatigues
to the thing this afternoon.

53:22.458 --> 53:24.875
The general, direct from the battlefield.

53:26.000 --> 53:28.542
No need to shower
when you're straight from the fight.

53:28.625 --> 53:29.667
- That's good.
- Yeah.

53:29.750 --> 53:30.875
- It's very good.
- [MATT] I like that.

53:30.958 --> 53:33.292
Well, just make sure
Willy has my fatigues on standby.

53:33.375 --> 53:34.375
[GLEN GRUNTS]

53:35.250 --> 53:37.208
Talking points for the president.

53:43.500 --> 53:44.500
[GLEN GRUNTS]

53:53.458 --> 53:54.708
How you doing, Glen?

53:56.292 --> 53:57.417
Oh! [SIGHS]

54:00.333 --> 54:02.792
This one is a bitch, right?

54:03.875 --> 54:05.875
Nothing about war is easy, Pat.

54:07.167 --> 54:08.250
Right on.

54:08.833 --> 54:12.375
Though I'm guessing, somewhere deep down,
you were happier in Iraq.

54:14.458 --> 54:16.250
A soldier leading soldiers.

54:17.917 --> 54:22.958
Soldiers above you, soldiers below you.
Just a nice bubble of soldiers.

54:23.042 --> 54:27.583
Just ordered. Right? 'Cause it has to be.

54:28.333 --> 54:31.958
War is chaos, so then the army has to be
the opposite of chaos.

54:32.708 --> 54:35.042
But now you find yourself
in the real world.

54:35.125 --> 54:37.708
Now you're dealing with civilians,
and civilians don't make sense.

54:38.708 --> 54:42.000
Not making sense is a luxury
I can't afford. Hmm.

54:43.292 --> 54:44.833
Lives depend on it.

54:45.583 --> 54:47.708
- No, of course.
- Yeah.

54:48.625 --> 54:49.917
Absolutely.

54:50.958 --> 54:53.542
And you can't live in the bubble forever.

54:53.625 --> 54:56.042
You gotta rise as your talents dictate.

54:58.417 --> 54:59.917
What do you want, Pat?

55:01.875 --> 55:04.208
How do you think this ends?

55:05.042 --> 55:07.917
Simple. We either win it or we lose it.

55:08.000 --> 55:09.042
Yeah, I don't know.

55:10.125 --> 55:12.500
I think I'm gonna call bullshit
on that, Glen.

55:13.458 --> 55:16.458
All the winning we were ever gonna do,
we did in the first six months.

55:16.542 --> 55:18.292
And since then,
we've just been making a mess.

55:18.375 --> 55:20.125
And that's all it was ever gonna be.

55:21.417 --> 55:23.000
You're not here to win.

55:23.625 --> 55:26.000
You're here to clean up the mess.

55:27.333 --> 55:29.583
You'll get your 40,000 troops.

55:29.667 --> 55:33.167
Get 'em in there. Get your PowerPoint
presentation in order, you know?

55:33.250 --> 55:35.375
Just move the needle a little bit.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.000
Show everyone how all the graphs are
pointing in the right direction.

55:38.083 --> 55:39.875
That's all you gotta do.

55:39.958 --> 55:43.042
That's how this ends best for you...
anyway.

55:44.083 --> 55:45.583
A nice-looking set of graphs.

55:46.583 --> 55:50.500
Or a nicer-looking set of graphs
than the last set of graphs.

55:51.875 --> 55:53.750
Either that or get yourself fired.

55:55.917 --> 55:59.042
Then you can say "I told you so"
when it all turns to shit

55:59.125 --> 56:03.250
or fizzles out or...
however it is this thing ends.

56:05.583 --> 56:07.583
There's no street parade
at the end of this one.

56:15.125 --> 56:16.458
It's good to talk.

[OBAMA] All right. How's it going?

57:21.583 --> 57:24.250
- Morning, sir. Nice to see you again.
- All right. Take care now.

- Mr. President.
- It's great to see you, General.

57:31.333 --> 57:33.750
I'm sorry,
but we're running behind schedule.

57:33.833 --> 57:35.792
I was looking forward to getting
some face time with you,

57:35.875 --> 57:37.958
but I gotta get this baby in the air.

57:38.625 --> 57:40.750
So... all right.

57:41.542 --> 57:42.958
Smile for the cameras, Glen.

57:46.792 --> 57:47.833
All right.

57:48.500 --> 57:50.083
Take care.

- Let's get going.
- [PAT] Yes, sir.

57:52.375 --> 57:54.708

[SEAN] <i>You could argue</i>

58:10.208 --> 58:12.458

<i>well, because it's only in war
that they feel truly relevant.</i>

58:19.542 --> 58:24.208

Uh, sir, before you get dragged
into the hubbub there,

58:42.792 --> 58:45.125
I want to introduce you
to Sean Cullen here.

58:45.208 --> 58:48.417
Sean's the writer from <i>Rolling Stone.</i>
He's been doing that profile piece on you.

for a couple days.

I'm the United States defense attaché
here in Paris.

Pleased to meet you.
This is my wife, Jeanie.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:27.542
Pleased to meet you, Jeanie.
Are you enjoying your time here in Paris?

01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.625
Oh, yes, very much. It's lovely.

01:00:29.708 --> 01:00:32.833
Isn't it? Have you managed to see
any museums or exhibitions?

01:00:32.917 --> 01:00:34.250
- Have you done the Louvre?
- Oh, um,

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:36.667
I... I think we're gonna be too busy
to see the Louvre.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:40.500
But I've been wandering around by myself
while Glen's at meetings, and...

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:42.417
oh, my, it's... it's lovely.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:45.167
General, I thought it went very well
at the École Militaire today.

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:47.833
I didn't get the opportunity
to introduce myself there.

01:00:47.917 --> 01:00:50.792
But, uh, there were some
very interesting people there today.

01:00:50.875 --> 01:00:53.833
If you'd like, I'd be very happy
to give you a rundown of the who's who

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.625
if you get a little window
in your schedule while...

01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:57.458
I appreciate that.
My schedule's very tight.

01:00:57.542 --> 01:00:59.458
Of course. Totally understood.

01:01:00.292 --> 01:01:03.250
General, I could introduce you to some
people here tonight if you'd prefer.

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:06.875
No, I... I think my team and I
have a grip on the who's who. Thank you.

01:01:06.958 --> 01:01:09.417
- Cory, where's Badi?
- Hmm?

01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:11.917
Uh, I don't know, boss.
He was here a minute ago.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.333
I thought he was supposed to be
sitting beside you and Jeanie.

01:01:14.417 --> 01:01:15.708
[CLEARS THROAT]

01:01:15.792 --> 01:01:20.208
General, I thought it best if you and I
took this opportunity to talk, so...

We are here tonight

to kick the only Afghan in the room

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:35.333
[IN ENGLISH] You have been
speaking to us now for 45 minutes,

01:13:35.417 --> 01:13:39.167
and yet in all of that time you have
only mentioned al-Qaeda once.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:41.958
Your own vice president has advocated

01:13:42.042 --> 01:13:46.000
a much smaller
and simpler counterterrorism approach

01:13:46.083 --> 01:13:48.625
to incapacitate what is estimated to be

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:53.542
little more than 100 al-Qaeda fighters
that still remain in Afghanistan

01:13:53.625 --> 01:13:58.417
to refocus on what it was
that started this war in the first place.

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:02.333
- Ah.
- Your analysis of the insurgency there

01:14:02.417 --> 01:14:05.583
suggests to me
there is no monolithic Taliban.

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:07.750
You are spread over the entire country.

01:14:07.833 --> 01:14:11.292
You are fighting 1,000 separate battles
with locals

01:14:11.375 --> 01:14:13.958
whose principal ideological position

01:14:14.042 --> 01:14:17.792
would seem to be simply that they don't
want foreign soldiers in their village.

01:14:17.875 --> 01:14:22.000
And that, General, you must know,
is a war you will never win.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:23.125
[GLEN] Ah.

01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:25.667

having spoken with many people
from many walks of life...

01:14:43.125 --> 01:14:49.000
that what these people want is the very
same thing that you and I want.

to deliver these things that you describe.

Ah, well...

[STUTTERING] I think
what I am trying to say,

01:15:42.333 --> 01:15:45.417

if this is sounding impolite,

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.667

Yes, I understand.

it is my job to ensure
that the personal ambitions

01:16:22.167 --> 01:16:25.833
You have devoted your entire life,
General, to the fighting of war.

And this situation
in Afghanistan, for you,

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.958
it is the culmination
of all your years of training,

We're taking the Helmand province,

Moshtarak will be the largest operation
yet to be conducted since this war began.

it is an important one.

a thorn in our ass since day one.

in our resolve.

If we infill teams here and here tonight,
we can set up our blocking positions,

for the marines tomorrow.

are where there still appears to be
a concentration of movement.

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.708

under the assumption

01:20:47.792 --> 01:20:51.750
that anyone who isn't a bad guy
has moved on or at least hunkered down.

Now, we've been kind enough
to plan this operation in such a way

01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:32.833
as to not make it look like the Americans
are here to get done what you couldn't.

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.583
But that is what's happening.

01:21:35.667 --> 01:21:39.000

of Helmand province,
