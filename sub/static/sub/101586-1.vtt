WEBVTT

00:04.934 --> 00:07.934
(suspenseful music)

00:27.042 --> 00:28.542
- It's him, do it!

00:32.160 --> 00:33.760
Shoot him in the fucking muzzle.

00:40.350 --> 00:42.597
Rob, what's the matter with you?

00:49.418 --> 00:50.251
Now do it!

00:50.251 --> 00:51.783
Shoot him in the fucking muzzle.

00:52.900 --> 00:55.483
Come on, shoot the fuckin' pig.

00:57.077 --> 01:01.827
(gun firing)
(squealing)

01:07.690 --> 01:08.840
What happened with you?

01:10.250 --> 01:11.697
You had visions, again?

01:15.360 --> 01:16.383
- Cut his ears.

01:21.773 --> 01:24.773
(blade unsheathing)

01:30.498 --> 01:33.498
(jet-pack rumbling)

01:55.097 --> 01:57.097
We got him first, Taraz.

02:01.198 --> 02:03.448
(spitting)

02:14.060 --> 02:17.640
(blade thudding)

02:17.640 --> 02:20.140
(guns firing)

02:36.340 --> 02:39.257
(jet-pack buzzing)

02:43.816 --> 02:45.983
(booming)

03:11.172 --> 03:13.609
(door squeaking)

03:13.609 --> 03:16.074
(booming)

03:16.074 --> 03:17.422
- This is war.

03:17.422 --> 03:19.423
Do you want to know how it all started?

03:20.550 --> 03:21.423
I'll tell you.

03:22.690 --> 03:25.203
It was during the third world war.

03:26.210 --> 03:27.823
There wasn't much left.

03:29.176 --> 03:30.680
(pig grunting)

03:30.680 --> 03:32.793
70% of humans died.

03:35.140 --> 03:39.110
I don't remember my real
father, but I remember him.

03:39.110 --> 03:41.900
- Rob, come I want to show you something.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.850
- [Rob Voiceover] The man
who made me what I am.

03:43.850 --> 03:46.360
- See, they don't go nowhere.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.500
They just turn into dirty old bones.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.103
God is a human mistake.

03:53.490 --> 03:56.453
We die 'cause of some shit.

03:58.380 --> 03:59.783
And we die full of shit.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.820
- [Rob Voiceover] A good man
with his own issues with God.

04:04.970 --> 04:06.050
- There's no God.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.143
Don't be fooled.

04:10.994 --> 04:13.911
(bones clattering)

04:16.130 --> 04:18.330
- [Rob Voiceover] This
is my sister, Raksha.

04:19.240 --> 04:20.603
She never loses a fight.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.103
(car rattling)

04:24.103 --> 04:26.770
- Rats, let's go get some candy.

04:37.693 --> 04:40.743
Nastja, where are you you fat bitch?

04:42.686 --> 04:43.519
Hey wait, wait, wait.

04:43.519 --> 04:44.450
- [Rob Voiceover] That was the day

04:44.450 --> 04:46.850
I saw Muzzle for the first time.

04:48.664 --> 04:51.664
(suspenseful music)

05:09.060 --> 05:11.155
(grunting and squealing)

05:11.155 --> 05:14.072
(glass shattering)

05:16.294 --> 05:19.044
This creature attacked my father.

05:20.308 --> 05:23.225
(shotgun blasting)

05:24.668 --> 05:26.663
(truck rumbling)

05:26.663 --> 05:28.496
Then militarists came.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.386
But not for help.

05:33.386 --> 05:35.531
- [Man On Loudspeaker]
Prepare to execute code 666.

05:35.531 --> 05:37.212
- Hey, this monster killed my friend.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.203
- [Man On Loudspeaker]
Prepare to execute code 666.

05:39.203 --> 05:42.521
- No, wait, wait there's some mistake!

05:42.521 --> 05:45.021
(guns firing)

05:46.388 --> 05:47.680
- [Rob Voiceover] They killed my father,

05:47.680 --> 05:51.003
burned the bodies,
destroying every evidence.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.853
We escaped.

05:58.430 --> 05:59.510
- There's no God.

05:59.510 --> 06:00.583
Don't be fooled.

06:01.652 --> 06:04.853
You want to pray to
something, pray to yourselves.

06:12.620 --> 06:15.373
No one knew who created the first Muzzle,

06:16.220 --> 06:18.493
the hybrid between human and pig.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.030
Americans blamed Russians and
Russians blamed Americans.

06:24.030 --> 06:27.513
Someone finished Hitler's
Uber-sold-at-an project.

06:29.010 --> 06:31.050
But then something went wrong

06:31.050 --> 06:34.883
and Muzzles got out of
control and enslaved humans.

06:39.230 --> 06:41.493
They started farming us like animals.

06:44.410 --> 06:46.423
We became their favorite meal.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.030
The remains of Russian and American armies

06:55.030 --> 06:58.933
collaborated in a desperate
attempt to fix the situation.

07:00.210 --> 07:02.410
They've deployed a biological weapon

07:02.410 --> 07:04.870
which was supposed to kill Muzzles.

07:04.870 --> 07:08.160
But all it did was making
every species sterile

07:08.160 --> 07:10.440
except the holy mother.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.690
She was their biggest advantage

07:14.086 --> 07:16.350
as she could still produce Muzzles.

07:16.350 --> 07:18.313
It's a giant human pig.

07:19.466 --> 07:20.716
But nobody have seen her.

07:21.810 --> 07:25.323
They say she eats half ton
of human meat every day.

07:26.260 --> 07:29.360
So me and Raksha intercepted
every delivery truck

07:29.360 --> 07:30.793
in order to find her.

07:34.930 --> 07:36.170
But they never betray her,

07:36.170 --> 07:38.687
no matter how much we torture them.

07:41.197 --> 07:43.697
(guns firing)

07:52.479 --> 07:55.229
(metal clinking)

08:04.241 --> 08:07.574
(rattling and rumbling)

08:24.132 --> 08:26.715
(gun blasting)

08:40.155 --> 08:42.700
(booming)

08:42.700 --> 08:43.803
- We have to go.

08:44.850 --> 08:46.693
His gang will come looking for us.

08:48.000 --> 08:52.063
- No, not before I take my medal of honor.

08:56.943 --> 08:59.110
(moaning)

09:09.482 --> 09:11.400
- [Rob Voiceover] My assistant.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.513
The girl with ass like hell.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.203
But mine,

09:20.870 --> 09:22.693
I think mine is better.

09:26.030 --> 09:27.753
The best in the world.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.801
But except one.

09:31.801 --> 09:35.301
(screeching and beeping)

09:41.722 --> 09:42.555
- Rob.

09:46.260 --> 09:47.760
Rob, are you here?

09:52.690 --> 09:53.902
Even when you're fucking me,

09:53.902 --> 09:56.002
you're thinking about this asshole Rafael.

10:01.820 --> 10:03.773
You're obsessed with this contest.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.670
Just a dream, Rob.

10:09.670 --> 10:11.510
It's not even real.

10:11.510 --> 10:12.343
- I'm sorry.

10:13.690 --> 10:15.810
I cannot control it.

10:15.810 --> 10:18.200
They just appear in my head.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.033
- Bullshit.

10:31.804 --> 10:32.654
But what is real.

10:38.872 --> 10:41.740
I have a feeling this
time it's gonna happen.

10:42.583 --> 10:44.473
- Come on baby, no way.

10:45.570 --> 10:49.883
- I can feel it inside me, a new life.

10:51.243 --> 10:54.080
- You know it's impossible.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.073
- I can feel it.

11:00.049 --> 11:03.382
(crashing and grunting)

11:08.538 --> 11:11.038
(guns firing)

11:13.938 --> 11:16.688
(dramatic music)

11:32.610 --> 11:33.443
- Rob.

11:40.304 --> 11:41.137
Astana.

11:42.363 --> 11:43.530
(pig grunting)

11:43.530 --> 11:47.947
(wall crumbling and engine rumbling)

11:51.239 --> 11:54.156
(melancholy music)

12:04.122 --> 12:08.163
- Lyudmila, it was a trap.

12:11.370 --> 12:15.383
My assistant Nina, she's dead.

12:28.298 --> 12:30.163
- Cry for pussy?

12:31.280 --> 12:33.063
Don't cry for pussy.

12:34.350 --> 12:35.463
Life is shit.

12:37.090 --> 12:38.823
But this is what you deserve.

12:41.875 --> 12:44.458
(gate opening)

12:57.977 --> 13:00.977
(metallic clunking)

13:07.918 --> 13:11.001
(footsteps thudding)

13:14.958 --> 13:17.940
- That was a teen muzzle
you tricked me to kill.

13:17.940 --> 13:19.383
Who was the real target?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.723
- Oh Robbie, don't start again my boy.

13:25.620 --> 13:30.620
This thing killed three
of our best informers.

13:32.100 --> 13:35.420
He deserved to die, don't suffer.

13:35.420 --> 13:39.310
- I'm not, but my assistant did,

13:39.310 --> 13:41.530
and someone has to pay.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.833
Now tell me the truth.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.763
- Vydra, leave us.

13:47.608 --> 13:50.441
(robotic buzzing)

13:53.688 --> 13:55.355
Was a secret meeting

13:57.640 --> 14:02.640
between this Muzzle
called Yuri and Asshole.

14:06.440 --> 14:08.673
- Asshole, Benedict Asshole?

14:11.072 --> 14:11.905
- Mm-hmm.

14:13.420 --> 14:18.070
We executed the special
operation to catch Asshole

14:18.070 --> 14:20.850
before they met.
- Benedict Asshole?

14:20.850 --> 14:23.653
- Yes, Benedict Asshole.

14:24.820 --> 14:29.820
We were afraid that if
Asshole wouldn't show up,

14:31.370 --> 14:34.683
Yuri would start to be suspicious.

14:37.010 --> 14:41.867
That's why we sent you to identify him.

14:42.939 --> 14:44.030
(gun firing)

14:44.030 --> 14:47.347
Taraz-Bulba wasn't
planned, so don't judge us.

14:48.840 --> 14:49.943
Only God can.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.330
- Benedict Asshole, finally.
- Yes.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.493
- What's on the plate?

14:57.570 --> 15:02.100
- Asshole knows the location
of secret human farm,

15:02.100 --> 15:03.660
called "The Liver",

15:03.660 --> 15:06.223
which is somewhere in New York.

15:08.530 --> 15:13.070
Every Monday, a special truck delivers

15:14.210 --> 15:17.153
fresh human meat for the mother.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.000
- Can I get a payment for this one?

15:21.000 --> 15:23.870
- You must get into the farm,

15:23.870 --> 15:26.870
trace the truck and kill the mother.

15:26.870 --> 15:30.990
- This is not my war, Lyudmila.

15:30.990 --> 15:32.620
- It's not about you.

15:32.620 --> 15:34.460
It's about humanity.

15:34.460 --> 15:37.423
- I think humanity does
not deserve to be saved.

15:39.280 --> 15:40.823
We had our chance.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.020
- I will give you a big reward.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.080
- This is not about money, Lyudmila.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.890
- This is our last chance to win.

15:50.890 --> 15:54.960
- My father told me that God...

15:55.840 --> 15:57.700
- [Gravedigger] Is a human mistake.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.283
- But I think humanity is God's mistake.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.063
And I've seen so much pain.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.103
Look into my car, Lyudmila.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.263
It's full of pictures of dead girls.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.889
- You are the best.

16:15.703 --> 16:18.453
(dramatic music)

16:28.427 --> 16:31.760
(thumping and grunting)

16:41.829 --> 16:44.079
(spitting)

17:39.776 --> 17:42.683
(thudding)

17:42.683 --> 17:45.933
- Where is the location of "The Liver"?

17:47.104 --> 17:48.854
Where is "The Liver"?

17:52.690 --> 17:54.123
I'll count to three.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.610
One.
(plopping)

18:01.610 --> 18:03.853
Two.
(whooshing)

18:05.420 --> 18:07.893
Three.
(spluttering)

18:10.300 --> 18:11.643
Put him back in the cage.

18:16.490 --> 18:18.593
They'd never betray their own kind.

18:19.740 --> 18:21.730
They're not like humans.

18:21.730 --> 18:24.110
- Rob, I need you.

18:24.110 --> 18:27.260
Go to the bar and get some drink.

18:27.260 --> 18:31.193
And please, don't reject this operation.

18:32.630 --> 18:35.497
Your father would be proud of you.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.981
(crying)

18:44.981 --> 18:47.148
- Not yet, you'll be fine.

18:48.648 --> 18:50.481
- I don't want to die.

19:15.701 --> 19:18.451
(dramatic music)

19:56.009 --> 19:58.092
(wiping)

20:13.086 --> 20:15.669
(boat buzzing)

20:19.769 --> 20:22.863
- Girls, the one who survives

20:22.863 --> 20:25.946
gonna be riding Rob's dick all night.

20:46.467 --> 20:49.550
(footsteps thudding)

20:50.729 --> 20:53.729
(suspenseful music)

21:16.753 --> 21:19.003
(thudding)

21:29.791 --> 21:32.791
(metallic clanking)

21:38.414 --> 21:41.747
(grunting and slashing)

21:46.353 --> 21:48.686
(whistling)

21:50.097 --> 21:50.930
- Come on!

21:58.876 --> 22:01.959
(helicopter buzzing)

22:15.790 --> 22:18.623
(Muzzle grunting)

22:22.976 --> 22:25.393
(gun firing)

22:30.969 --> 22:33.302
(whooshing)

22:53.112 --> 22:56.112
- [Vydra] Rendezvous in two minutes.

22:57.494 --> 22:59.827
- I need a few minutes more.

23:03.863 --> 23:06.280
(gun firing)

23:15.644 --> 23:18.561
(metallic slicing)

23:31.786 --> 23:34.036
(thudding)

23:58.494 --> 24:01.827
(footsteps approaching)

24:11.433 --> 24:13.600
(hissing)

24:23.451 --> 24:26.368
(robotic whirring)

24:48.774 --> 24:50.607
- I know how you feel.

24:55.414 --> 24:56.997
- How can you know?

24:57.915 --> 24:59.748
You're just a machine.

25:01.873 --> 25:04.373
- I understand human emotions.

25:14.235 --> 25:17.318
But I don't understand their actions.

25:19.115 --> 25:21.823
But I have a question.

25:23.174 --> 25:25.424
Why do you have a mustache?

25:26.408 --> 25:28.491
- You don't want to know.

26:12.295 --> 26:14.462
(dinging)

26:18.971 --> 26:23.138
(man singing in foreign language)

26:27.614 --> 26:29.864
(clapping)

27:12.552 --> 27:16.052
(screeching and clicking)

27:27.920 --> 27:29.520
- Don't be sad, Rob.

27:29.520 --> 27:32.210
I deserve to be the best model.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.370
You're just a poor boy.

27:34.370 --> 27:36.940
I'm sorry, I can't stay here

27:36.940 --> 27:39.320
and look at you how lonely you are.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.163
Let me introduce you to some chicks.

27:42.630 --> 27:43.800
May I introduce you

27:44.730 --> 27:49.603
to the second place of
this contest, Rob Justice.

27:50.560 --> 27:51.880
- Nice to meet you, Rob.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.480
- [Rob] You look just like my sister,

27:54.480 --> 27:56.303
except she has a mustache.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.126
(metallic whooshing)

28:01.126 --> 28:02.293
- You bastard.

28:05.510 --> 28:08.833
You motherfucker, where have you been?

28:09.750 --> 28:11.650
Why did you leave me for so long?

28:11.650 --> 28:13.183
- It wasn't my fault.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.163
I was in some deep pork shit.

28:18.510 --> 28:20.477
- Askar sent me with the recruits,

28:21.760 --> 28:22.660
but they are dead.

28:24.650 --> 28:28.050
- I know, it's impossible
to get through the forest.

28:28.050 --> 28:30.013
- Shh, kiss me.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.330
But I knocked them out.
- I know.

28:39.330 --> 28:42.556
- I never lose a fight.
- I know.

28:42.556 --> 28:44.898
- I knocked them out.
- I know.

28:44.898 --> 28:47.593
- I never lose a fight.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.874
- You never lose a fight.

28:49.874 --> 28:51.624
Let's go to my place.

28:55.356 --> 28:58.513
- Rob, don't you think
you owe us some answers?

28:59.740 --> 29:02.363
Tell us what the hell
happened over there in Astana.

29:03.790 --> 29:05.823
And where the fuck did you disappear to?

29:07.468 --> 29:09.090
Heard you dancin' with the pigs

29:09.090 --> 29:10.373
while we're dyin' here.

29:13.769 --> 29:16.230
(hissing)

29:16.230 --> 29:18.193
You couldn't do it if you wanted to.

29:19.310 --> 29:21.763
Not here, not now.

29:23.180 --> 29:24.580
- You're already a dead man.

29:28.562 --> 29:31.062
(light music)

29:53.120 --> 29:55.144
I'm coming with you.

29:55.144 --> 29:57.673
- No, it's too dangerous.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.960
- Do I have anything to lose except you?

30:03.610 --> 30:05.063
I can't be a mother.

30:06.020 --> 30:07.563
I can't have family and kids.

30:09.090 --> 30:10.343
Why should I be scared?

30:18.340 --> 30:20.040
You still get visions like before?

30:21.182 --> 30:24.213
- Yeah, sometimes.

30:26.228 --> 30:28.940
- Don't worry, I want you to know

30:30.820 --> 30:32.913
to me you're my Mr. Universe.

30:35.810 --> 30:37.437
So what's the plan?

30:39.597 --> 30:42.591
- I'm gonna help Asshole to escape.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.424
- What?

30:43.424 --> 30:44.980
- Don't worry, I'm on your side.

30:44.980 --> 30:46.150
I'll help you.

30:46.150 --> 30:47.246
Tomorrow.

30:47.246 --> 30:49.829
(cell opening)

30:51.555 --> 30:53.383
(gate opening)

30:53.383 --> 30:56.314
- Are you gonna put a tracker on him?

30:56.314 --> 30:58.967
- I need the location of "The Liver".

30:58.967 --> 31:01.320
(beeping)

31:01.320 --> 31:06.320
- Yes, I will.
(moaning)

31:06.670 --> 31:07.920
- God bless you.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.020
You are a genius.

31:10.020 --> 31:12.070
But don't lose him.

31:12.070 --> 31:14.203
Now he knows where our base is.

31:15.630 --> 31:19.227
- God might lose him, but I won't.

31:22.323 --> 31:24.573
(clapping)

31:26.407 --> 31:30.074
(music in foreign language)

31:42.726 --> 31:45.809
(helicopter buzzing)

31:57.665 --> 32:00.263
We must land and leave the chopper.

32:00.263 --> 32:03.322
- They're fast as hell, you know that.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.170
- He entered the central park.

32:05.170 --> 32:06.720
We can trace him on the ground.

32:08.385 --> 32:09.893
- No, it's too dangerous.

32:15.153 --> 32:15.986
- What?

32:21.745 --> 32:23.147
We're landing.

32:23.147 --> 32:26.064
(buttons clicking)

32:50.950 --> 32:53.200
(rattling)

33:06.508 --> 33:08.675
(slicing)

33:13.730 --> 33:15.980
(whirring)

33:32.747 --> 33:34.997
(plopping)

34:00.389 --> 34:03.389
(suspenseful music)

34:27.378 --> 34:29.628
(knocking)

34:32.695 --> 34:34.945
(sniffing)

35:00.335 --> 35:03.591
(doors closing)

35:03.591 --> 35:05.841
(thudding)

35:14.947 --> 35:16.576
- Let's get inside and kill them all.

35:16.576 --> 35:17.709
- We must hurry.

35:17.709 --> 35:19.250
This is not our war.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.044
The truck is ready to depart.

35:21.044 --> 35:22.462
We must hurry.

35:22.462 --> 35:24.712
(knocking)

35:38.760 --> 35:41.010
(sniffing)

36:23.171 --> 36:27.921
(gun firing)
(squealing)

37:40.149 --> 37:43.399
(slicing and thudding)

37:47.435 --> 37:49.935
(baby crying)

37:55.277 --> 37:57.023
- I've changed my mind.

37:59.660 --> 38:01.210
We should spend some time here.

38:02.171 --> 38:04.754
(cart rolling)

38:37.115 --> 38:39.615
(guns firing)

39:18.430 --> 39:22.597
- Never trust humans.
(shotgun blasting)

39:37.197 --> 39:40.614
- [Rob] But this is not Benedict Asshole.

39:41.830 --> 39:43.500
This is Robert Asshole.

39:46.152 --> 39:50.261
Benedict Asshole?
- Yes, Benedict Asshole.

39:50.261 --> 39:53.915
(energetic music)

39:53.915 --> 39:57.176
(pig grunting)

39:57.176 --> 39:59.676
(guns firing)

40:29.453 --> 40:31.211
I ran out of bullets.

40:31.211 --> 40:32.211
- Me either.

40:34.822 --> 40:36.405
- What about these?

40:37.473 --> 40:38.973
- Just decoration.

40:41.267 --> 40:44.850
Don't worry, you know
I never lose a fight.

40:45.979 --> 40:48.479
(light music)

40:55.697 --> 40:57.864
(booming)

40:59.697 --> 41:02.114
(gun firing)

41:10.615 --> 41:11.448
- Askar!

41:59.853 --> 42:01.936
- Come on, bro, let's go.

42:13.668 --> 42:16.418
(truck rumbling)

42:26.790 --> 42:28.123
- I have a plan.

42:31.525 --> 42:33.608
- I hate that I love you.

42:41.109 --> 42:44.026
(melancholy music)

42:50.782 --> 42:53.365
(door closing)

42:54.864 --> 42:57.114
(whirring)

43:24.048 --> 43:26.215
(gasping)

43:31.988 --> 43:33.405
- Raksha, Raksha.

43:38.108 --> 43:41.358
- [Raksha] Rob, I cannot breathe, here.

43:45.187 --> 43:46.020
- Raksha.

43:46.020 --> 43:48.053
- Oh my God, we're gonna die here.

43:52.740 --> 43:54.240
- There is no God.

43:58.742 --> 44:01.875
- [Woman On Radio] Agent Rafael, report.

44:01.875 --> 44:05.375
Is everything going according to the plan?

44:06.510 --> 44:09.040
- Tell the mother they've
swallowed the bait.

44:10.776 --> 44:13.526
(chords ringing)

44:41.981 --> 44:44.481
(light music)

44:46.758 --> 44:49.091
(simmering)

45:17.416 --> 45:20.333
- Why did you leave me for so long?

45:22.201 --> 45:23.716
- I'm sorry.

45:23.716 --> 45:27.435
- Why did you leave me for so long?

45:27.435 --> 45:30.018
- I was in some deep pork shit.

45:31.260 --> 45:34.540
(door opening)

45:34.540 --> 45:36.373
- That's not me.
- No!

45:37.217 --> 45:40.100
- Get away from her.
- Put the gun down.

45:40.100 --> 45:41.873
- Get away from her.
- Put the gun down!

45:43.123 --> 45:46.640
- Protect our baby.
- Put the gun down.

45:46.640 --> 45:49.191
- That's not me.
- Baby, save the three of us.

45:49.191 --> 45:50.024
- Raksha.
- Save our child.

45:50.024 --> 45:53.759
- Raksha, put the gun down.
- Get away from her.

45:53.759 --> 45:54.940
- [Rob] Raksha, put the gun down now.

45:54.940 --> 45:57.375
- Protect our baby.
- Put the gun down.

45:57.375 --> 45:59.132
- Get away from her.
- Don't listen to her.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.993
- No, no.
(bubbling)

46:00.993 --> 46:02.550
I swear I'll shoot you.

46:02.550 --> 46:05.585
- She's not me, Rob.
- Now put your gun down now.

46:05.585 --> 46:07.240
- Please.
- You're not real.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.263
- She's not me.
- She's real.

46:21.820 --> 46:24.237
(gun firing)

46:25.481 --> 46:30.281
- Cuckoo.
(laughing)

46:32.550 --> 46:34.350
- [Gravedigger] Don't cry for pussy.

46:35.610 --> 46:39.090
Life is shit, but this
is what you deserve.

46:45.353 --> 46:48.436
(footsteps thudding)

47:17.273 --> 47:20.023
(truck rumbling)

47:44.237 --> 47:46.320
- Vydra, can you hear me?

47:49.789 --> 47:51.206
Which year is it?

47:52.248 --> 47:53.165
Where am I?

48:01.984 --> 48:04.890
(Muzzles grunting)

48:04.890 --> 48:07.640
(dramatic music)

48:09.009 --> 48:11.676
(boy screaming)

48:14.449 --> 48:16.949
(guns firing)

48:18.113 --> 48:20.613
(ricocheting)

49:39.164 --> 49:41.020
- Rob Justice?

49:41.020 --> 49:44.103
(concrete crumbling)

50:50.727 --> 50:52.577
- Do you remember how she looks like?

50:57.133 --> 50:58.550
- Krasnajq Pizda.

51:02.100 --> 51:03.163
I remember her.

51:04.960 --> 51:06.423
She was my assistant.

51:07.260 --> 51:08.163
I trained her.

51:37.030 --> 51:39.263
Tell the mother, they've
swallowed the bait.

51:41.240 --> 51:42.683
- They tried to play us.

51:44.270 --> 51:46.382
There was a betrayer among us.

51:46.382 --> 51:48.342
Raksha.
- Oh my God.

51:48.342 --> 51:49.853
We're gonna die here.

51:52.304 --> 51:55.553
(gun firing)

51:55.553 --> 51:58.310
(whirring)

51:58.310 --> 52:00.453
- Tell me about this long-haired warrior.

52:02.340 --> 52:04.283
Was he beautiful and eye catching?

52:08.240 --> 52:09.330
- Yeah, I know.

52:10.620 --> 52:13.293
I want to meet him in a battle.

52:15.810 --> 52:17.123
- To a safe place.

52:21.252 --> 52:23.669
(gun firing)

52:40.638 --> 52:41.721
Raksha.
- Rob?

52:43.040 --> 52:44.360
- Raksha, it's me.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.943
- You in a Muzzler tracer?

52:47.454 --> 52:48.860
I cannot believe.

52:48.860 --> 52:50.110
How can you be so?

52:50.110 --> 52:53.670
- I know, we promised to kill
every truck that we meet.

52:53.670 --> 52:56.400
- The coordinates you gave
me were 50 miles away.

52:57.540 --> 53:00.040
(light music)

53:07.978 --> 53:09.377
Fuck, Cristiano.

53:09.377 --> 53:12.377
(suspenseful music)

53:24.010 --> 53:24.900
- Cristiano, Rob.

53:27.645 --> 53:29.145
- [Vydra] I know how you feel.

53:30.770 --> 53:33.113
- How can you know, fucking machine?

53:35.740 --> 53:39.377
Come on bro, when it's
raining you always get wet.

53:41.051 --> 53:41.884
Come on.

53:52.011 --> 53:54.761
(dramatic music)

54:47.237 --> 54:48.440
- Are we safe here?

54:48.440 --> 54:51.420
- You know they're afraid of water.

54:51.420 --> 54:55.193
- Yes, but they're
learning fast, evolving.

54:56.977 --> 54:58.427
I think we're losing the war.

55:08.325 --> 55:09.543
- What happened?

55:11.080 --> 55:13.123
You dream the time this time?

55:14.790 --> 55:16.053
Did you save my father?

55:17.680 --> 55:18.973
- This time I was late.

55:25.580 --> 55:27.530
But at least I was in the correct year.

55:36.800 --> 55:39.749
- We must steal a gun from guard.

55:39.749 --> 55:40.593
- And then what?

55:40.593 --> 55:44.423
- Then kill everybody
in the base, everybody.

55:45.320 --> 55:46.153
- Can't wait.

55:47.310 --> 55:48.803
- They're all guilty.

55:49.920 --> 55:51.923
- I miss my dad so much.

55:59.789 --> 56:02.039
(thumping)

56:29.472 --> 56:33.260
- Shh, shh, shh.

56:33.260 --> 56:35.303
I'm on your side, I'm on your side.

56:40.760 --> 56:41.593
- Who are you?

56:43.220 --> 56:46.053
- I'm you, Rob, and you are me,

56:49.123 --> 56:50.503
but 25 years later.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.340
I'm here to help.

56:53.340 --> 56:55.810
- So help me, take me out of here.

56:55.810 --> 56:58.950
- No, I can't take you with me.

56:58.950 --> 57:02.193
You must go along through all
the adventures to become me.

57:03.800 --> 57:05.423
- You are very beautiful.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.680
Can I wake up Raksha to show her

57:09.680 --> 57:13.390
how brave and strong one day I'll become?

57:13.390 --> 57:16.527
- No, don't tell her anything.

57:17.660 --> 57:19.110
Can you promise me something?

57:20.010 --> 57:21.290
- Yes.

57:21.290 --> 57:25.090
- Tomorrow, don't attack
the military base.

57:25.090 --> 57:27.140
Your sister will get hurt

57:27.140 --> 57:29.523
and she'll suffer till
the end of her life,

57:31.040 --> 57:34.290
carrying metal braces just to walk.

57:34.290 --> 57:37.520
- I must revenge for my father.

57:37.520 --> 57:40.780
- You will, but later.

57:40.780 --> 57:42.200
- Are you sure?

57:42.200 --> 57:43.850
- Of course.

57:43.850 --> 57:45.163
You're living my life.

57:46.780 --> 57:48.680
- Okay, I promise.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.087
- Give me your hand.

57:55.335 --> 57:59.591
This is just to remind you
that it wasn't a dream.

57:59.591 --> 58:02.008
(rock music)

58:46.827 --> 58:49.035
(gun firing)
(screaming)

58:49.035 --> 58:52.363
- Rob, Rob, we are late.

58:56.720 --> 58:58.540
- Calm down, Raksha.

58:58.540 --> 59:00.840
Let's wait couple of days.

59:00.840 --> 59:05.190
- How can you change your
mind so fast, fucking coward?

59:05.190 --> 59:06.973
- No, I'm not.

59:08.850 --> 59:11.871
I just had a prophet dream.

59:11.871 --> 59:14.371
(light music)

59:53.051 --> 59:56.051
- Oh my God, Rob, I'm walking alone.

59:57.670 --> 59:59.560
- There is no God.

59:59.560 --> 1:00:00.773
We call it teleport.

1:00:05.549 --> 1:00:09.549
(wind whooshing and whispering)

1:00:20.986 --> 1:00:23.660
- What I have to tell the mother now?

1:00:23.660 --> 1:00:24.843
That you're an idiot?

1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:28.873
How can you let them to escape?

1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.000
I thought Rob and his sister are dead.

1:00:35.210 --> 1:00:36.043
- They will.

1:00:37.093 --> 1:00:41.120
Commander, please, give me a chance.

1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:46.120
I promise they'll die
faster than you can predict.

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:50.170
- Agent Rafael, this is your last chance.

1:00:50.170 --> 1:00:54.470
If you fail again, I will
send you where you belong to.

1:00:54.470 --> 1:00:59.470
You will spend your whole
miserable life at the catwalk.

1:01:01.552 --> 1:01:04.552
(suspenseful music)

1:01:54.268 --> 1:01:57.400
- Two humans are approaching.

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:59.913
Should I exterminate them?
- No.

1:02:02.063 --> 1:02:04.070
- It smells like a trap.

1:02:04.070 --> 1:02:05.490
- But what if it's not?

1:02:05.490 --> 1:02:06.873
We cannot hide it forever.

1:02:23.110 --> 1:02:24.973
You two supposed to be dead.

1:02:27.196 --> 1:02:30.696
(guns firing and booming)

1:02:35.217 --> 1:02:38.300
(metallic whooshing)

1:02:41.350 --> 1:02:43.790
- Ester, is that you?

1:02:43.790 --> 1:02:44.623
- You left me.

1:02:45.570 --> 1:02:49.323
But you know, bullets always fair.

1:02:56.787 --> 1:03:00.870
(dishes and silverware rattling)

1:04:50.298 --> 1:04:52.035
- What is this?

1:04:52.035 --> 1:04:54.684
- Benedict Asshole.
- Benedict Asshole?

1:04:54.684 --> 1:04:56.267
- Benedict Asshole.

1:05:00.521 --> 1:05:03.438
(plastic rattling)

1:06:15.444 --> 1:06:17.777
- It's not Benedict Asshole.

1:06:19.463 --> 1:06:21.296
This is Massimo Zardi.

1:06:25.517 --> 1:06:27.533
- I want to be your assistant.

1:06:29.470 --> 1:06:30.330
That's why I'm here.

1:06:30.330 --> 1:06:32.180
That's why I went through the forest.

1:06:37.136 --> 1:06:39.380
- You know the protocol.

1:06:39.380 --> 1:06:41.323
- I do, master.
- Let's go.

1:07:04.333 --> 1:07:07.000
(Ester moaning)

1:08:08.227 --> 1:08:10.266
(thudding)

1:08:10.266 --> 1:08:13.519
(speaking foreign language)

1:08:13.519 --> 1:08:15.769
(punching)

1:08:20.703 --> 1:08:23.453
(piano clunking)

1:08:25.982 --> 1:08:27.315
- Krasnaq Pizda.

1:08:29.705 --> 1:08:32.622
(Krasnaq laughing)

1:08:36.123 --> 1:08:36.956
- Vydra!

1:08:50.133 --> 1:08:52.800
(piano tinking)

1:09:11.763 --> 1:09:14.263
(guns firing)

1:09:30.046 --> 1:09:32.546
(ricocheting)

1:09:43.458 --> 1:09:45.708
(growling)

1:09:48.948 --> 1:09:51.281
(screaming)

1:09:56.622 --> 1:09:59.539
(robotic whirring)

1:10:07.264 --> 1:10:12.264
- Where is Rafael?

1:10:13.609 --> 1:10:15.192
Where is the crypt?

1:10:39.803 --> 1:10:43.636
(singing in foreign language)

1:11:46.090 --> 1:11:47.110
Who are you?

1:11:47.110 --> 1:11:48.917
I have questions.

1:11:48.917 --> 1:11:50.500
(Rafael laughing)

1:11:50.500 --> 1:11:52.640
- But I don't have answers.

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:53.830
- Where is the mother?

1:11:53.830 --> 1:11:55.790
Why do I have visions?

1:11:55.790 --> 1:11:59.300
- Oh Robbie, poor boy.

1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:01.703
You really think everything is so simple?

1:12:05.300 --> 1:12:08.863
So what if I tell you everything?

1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:13.000
That I'm this.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.380
That you're having
visions because of that.

1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:17.250
That the mother is there.

1:12:17.250 --> 1:12:19.720
- Then I would have answers.

1:12:19.720 --> 1:12:23.730
- What if you're having
the wrong questions?

1:12:23.730 --> 1:12:25.413
What if you're wrong?

1:12:27.830 --> 1:12:28.663
Then what?

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:32.610
Open your eyes, Rob.

1:12:32.610 --> 1:12:34.180
People are dying.

1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:36.740
They can't reproduce anymore.

1:12:36.740 --> 1:12:37.993
Humanity is dead.

1:12:38.850 --> 1:12:40.033
Muzzles won.

1:12:41.650 --> 1:12:42.603
They're the future.

1:12:43.630 --> 1:12:46.173
Even if you manage to kill the mother,

1:12:47.070 --> 1:12:48.260
what will you win?

1:12:48.260 --> 1:12:53.080
Several years of pathetic human existence?

1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:53.913
And then what?

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:56.823
We had our chance.

1:12:58.319 --> 1:13:01.220
Actually hold on, didn't you say,

1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:03.110
humanity doesn't need...

1:13:03.110 --> 1:13:04.203
- How'd you know?

1:13:06.530 --> 1:13:07.430
- Let me tell you.

1:13:13.090 --> 1:13:15.020
You see, Rob,

1:13:15.020 --> 1:13:17.910
white implies black,

1:13:17.910 --> 1:13:19.703
light implies death.

1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.030
Actually when I think about it,

1:13:23.030 --> 1:13:26.010
death implies life.

1:13:26.010 --> 1:13:30.140
For one to exist, there
has to be another one.

1:13:30.140 --> 1:13:33.293
For every hero, there has to be a villain.

1:13:34.130 --> 1:13:36.970
Have you ever wondered why

1:13:38.150 --> 1:13:41.343
even with a teleport at your disposal,

1:13:42.210 --> 1:13:44.613
you couldn't catch the mother?
- Why?

1:13:45.970 --> 1:13:48.000
- Because deep inside you know

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:49.840
you're nothing without your revenge.

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:51.230
You need the mother.

1:13:51.230 --> 1:13:53.700
You need the suffering of humanity.

1:13:53.700 --> 1:13:56.640
You need the constant state of war

1:13:56.640 --> 1:14:01.640
in order for Rob Justice, the
legendary warrior, to exist.

1:14:03.380 --> 1:14:06.040
What if I told you that war

1:14:06.900 --> 1:14:10.420
has ended many times in the future

1:14:10.420 --> 1:14:15.420
and you're the one that keeps
coming back to relive it

1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:21.700
over, and over, and over again?

1:14:21.890 --> 1:14:23.690
- You're just a filthy liar.

1:14:26.296 --> 1:14:29.046
(dramatic music)

1:15:43.031 --> 1:15:44.281
- You okay Rob?

1:15:45.200 --> 1:15:48.993
Hey dude, are you trippin' again?

1:15:48.993 --> 1:15:50.313
Are you okay, Rob?

1:15:54.700 --> 1:15:56.740
- Come on guys, we are late for the show.

1:15:56.740 --> 1:15:58.390
This is Massimo Zardi.

1:15:58.390 --> 1:15:59.483
It's not a joke.

1:16:00.507 --> 1:16:02.160
(car rumbling)

1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:04.571
- Come on man, get back from apocalypse.

1:16:04.571 --> 1:16:05.404
(horn honking)

1:16:05.404 --> 1:16:06.670
- It's Rafael, we have to hurry.

1:16:08.610 --> 1:16:12.733
- I'm okay, Uve, I'm okay.

1:16:23.820 --> 1:16:25.320
- You better be on point, bitches.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:27.513
- Hey, please wait, Rob is coming.

1:16:30.170 --> 1:16:32.550
- He can use his damn teleport.

1:16:32.550 --> 1:16:33.603
Don't think about it.

1:16:39.713 --> 1:16:42.104
(whooshing)

1:16:42.104 --> 1:16:44.670
(barking and growling)

1:16:44.670 --> 1:16:46.920
- Sorry babe, we're full.

1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:48.973
That one belongs to the mother.

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:52.297
(screeching)

1:17:02.762 --> 1:17:04.929
(zipping)

1:17:29.399 --> 1:17:32.399
(suspenseful music)

1:18:02.196 --> 1:18:04.446
(whirring)

1:18:12.439 --> 1:18:16.606
(man singing in foreign language)

1:19:15.557 --> 1:19:18.557
(suspenseful music)
