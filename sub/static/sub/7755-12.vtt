This is exactly what I'm talking

about.
If I'm not your sidekick, then
why do you always use me for

wouldn't need me here at all!

to shut up when it's helping me

21:18.611 --> 21:24.749
>> Gumball: [ Crying ] Sure, we
can -- just as soon as we return
the mother you stole.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.751
>> Darwin: Yes!
The note's still here!
[ Door opens ]

21:26.753 --> 21:28.519

[ Thump! ]
>> [ Muffled scream ]

21:28.521 --> 21:32.290
>> Oh, hey, guys!
Did you come for the game?
Sorry. My mom cleaned my room.

21:32.292 --> 21:37.395
Only she knows where it is, and
i can't find her anywhere.
>> [ Muffled crying ]

>> Gumball: You know what?
Just keep it.
