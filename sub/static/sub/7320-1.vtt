WEBVTT

00:00.767 --> 00:01.667
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:01.700 --> 00:03.533
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU, GEORGE,
AND I HOPE

00:03.567 --> 00:05.567
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH ME, TOO.
I WAS NAMED CHIEF RESIDENT.

00:05.600 --> 00:09.267
(George)
I'VE FAILED MY INTERN TEST.
YOU CAN START
FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.400
REPEAT MY INTERNSHIP?

00:10.433 --> 00:12.433
(Derek)
I MET A WOMAN LAST NIGHT.
HI.

00:12.467 --> 00:15.267
YOU MET A WOMAN LAST NIGHT?
I'M LEXIE. LEXIE GREY.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.333
(Cristina) HE'S GONE.

00:18.367 --> 00:20.667
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU, BUT YOU'RE
CONSTANTLY LEAVING ME.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.000
IT'S OVER... SO OVER.

00:28.067 --> 00:30.333
(alarm beeps)

00:30.367 --> 00:33.367
***

00:34.767 --> 00:38.367
(Meredith) IN THE PRACTICE
OF MEDICINE,

00:38.400 --> 00:40.033
CHANGE IS INEVITABLE--

00:40.067 --> 00:42.333
NEW SURGICAL TECHNIQUES
ARE CREATED,

00:42.367 --> 00:43.733
PROCEDURES ARE UPDATED,

00:43.767 --> 00:46.100
LEVELS OF EXPERTISE INCREASE.

00:46.133 --> 00:49.067
INNOVATION IS EVERYTHING.

00:49.100 --> 00:52.467
NOTHING REMAINS THE SAME
FOR LONG.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.500
WE EITHER ADAPT TO CHANGE...

00:56.533 --> 00:59.567
OR WE GET LEFT BEHIND.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.300
***

01:08.267 --> 01:11.133
I HAVE FIVE RULES.
MEMORIZE THEM.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.500
RULE NUMBER ONE,
DON'T BOTHER SUCKING UP.

01:12.533 --> 01:14.633
I ALREADY HATE YOU.
THAT'S NOT GONNA CHANGE.

01:14.667 --> 01:16.567
TRAUMA PROTOCOLS,
PHONE LISTS, PAGERS.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.833
THE NURSES WILL PAGE YOU.

01:17.867 --> 01:20.700
YOU ANSWER EVERY PAGE AT A RUN--
A RUN. THAT'S RULE NUMBER TWO.

01:20.733 --> 01:22.500
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO FOLLOW ME.

01:22.533 --> 01:26.333
***

01:26.367 --> 01:28.767
YOUR FIRST SHIFT STARTS NOW
AND LASTS 36 HOURS.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.267
YOU'RE GRUNTS, NOBODIES,

01:30.300 --> 01:32.100
THE BOTTOM
OF THE SURGICAL FOOD CHAIN.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.100
YOU RUN LABS, YOU WRITE ORDERS,

01:34.133 --> 01:36.033
YOU WORK EVERY SECOND NIGHT
UNTIL YOU DROP,

01:36.067 --> 01:37.567
AND YOU DON'T COMPLAIN.

01:37.600 --> 01:40.467
ON CALL ROOMS. SLEEP WHEN
YOU CAN, WHERE YOU CAN.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.367
YOU KNOW,
BUT NOT WITH ANYBODY.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.533
NOT ATTENDINGS--
ESPECIALLY NOT ATTENDINGS.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.300
SLEEPING WITH ATTENDINGS--
NOT A GOOD IDEA.

01:47.333 --> 01:49.233
WHERE WAS I?

01:49.267 --> 01:51.800
UM, RULE NUMBER THREE.

01:51.833 --> 01:54.133
IF YOU'RE SLEEPING,
DO NOT WAKE YOU

01:54.167 --> 01:55.700
UNLESS A PATIENT'S
ACTUALLY DYING.

01:55.733 --> 01:58.667
THE DYING PATIENT BETTER NOT
BE DEAD WHEN I GET THERE,

01:58.700 --> 02:00.600
BECAUSE NOT ONLY WILL YOU
HAVE KILLED SOMEONE,

02:00.633 --> 02:03.433
YOU WILL HAVE WOKEN ME FOR
NO GOOD REASON. ARE WE CLEAR?

02:03.467 --> 02:04.667
(Cristina) YES?

02:04.700 --> 02:06.633
THAT WAS FOUR RULES.
YOU SAID FIVE.

02:06.667 --> 02:10.800
RULE NUMBER FIVE--
WHEN I MOVE, YOU MOVE.

02:18.100 --> 02:20.733
GO!

02:20.767 --> 02:23.467
I HATE THEM.
(Meredith) YOU DON'T
HATE THEM. YOU HATE YOU.

02:23.500 --> 02:25.433
THAT WAS HIDEOUS.
I FEEL LIKE A FRAUD.

02:25.467 --> 02:27.367
I ROCKED IT.
I THINK I'M THE NEW NAZI.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.433
OH, YOU ARE NOT
THE NEW NAZI.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.367
MEREDITH,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.
GEORGE. HI.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.533
HEY.
HOW WAS YOUR VACATION?

02:33.567 --> 02:35.300
UM, FINE.
UM, MEREDITH, CAN WE--

02:35.333 --> 02:36.833
'CAUSE MINE WAS...
I DIDN'T DO MUCH.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.767
I HUNG OUT ALONE...
FOR 17 DAYS.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.433
WHICH IS THE LAST TIME
THAT I SAW YOU,

02:41.467 --> 02:43.200
THE DAY
OF CRISTINA'S WEDDING,

02:43.233 --> 02:45.233
WHICH WAS... WELL...

02:45.267 --> 02:47.767
THEN MER AND CRISTINA WENT ON
CRISTINA'S HONEYMOON WITHOUT ME.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.700
GIRL-ON-GIRL HONEYMOON.
(laughs)

02:49.733 --> 02:52.667
AND THEN ALEX TOOK A ROAD TRIP
TO SEE AVA WITHOUT ME.

02:52.700 --> 02:54.733
I DID NOT GO TO SEE AVA.
AND HER NAME'S REBECCA.

02:54.767 --> 02:56.567
AND I DIDN'T GO SEE HER.
I JUST DROVE IN THAT DIRECTION.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.500
OH, WHY IS EVERYONE
SO TINGLY AND HURT?

02:58.533 --> 03:01.300
I MEAN, I'M THE ONE WHO WAS
LEFT AT THE ALTAR.

03:01.333 --> 03:03.233
I'M FINE, BY THE WAY.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.400
I HONEYMOONED IN HAWAII
AND I SNORKLED.

03:05.433 --> 03:08.100
WHAT'D YOU DO, GEORGE?
UM, MEREDITH...

03:08.133 --> 03:10.667
I-I REALLY NEED
TO TALK TO YOU.
UH, HEY,
YOU WANT TO KNOW--

03:10.700 --> 03:13.033
HEY, UM, THIS IS
FOR RESIDENTS ONLY. NO INTERNS.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.367
YEAH.
YEAH, GET OUTTA HERE.

03:15.400 --> 03:16.733
(Alex) BABIES.
(Izzie) YEAH, GO AWAY.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.767
007s IN TRAINING.
(Cristina) SERIOUSLY.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.733
I GUESS
I SHOULD BE GOING, TOO.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.367
(Meredith) NO, GEORGE.
WE DIDN'T MEAN YOU.
NO, I'M AN INTERN.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.533
WAIT. WHAT DID YOU WANT
TO TELL ME?
UH, IS THIS HOW
IT'S GONNA BE ALL YEAR?

03:25.567 --> 03:27.467
BECAUSE BAMBI HAS GOT TO
LEARN HOW TO COPE.
AT LEAST HE CAME BACK.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.400
(Meredith) YEAH,
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.
DUDE, HE FAILED HIS EXAM

03:29.433 --> 03:31.733
AND GOT LEFT BACK
IN KINDERGARTEN.
MM-HMM.

03:31.767 --> 03:34.767
HE WON'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.800
HAVE YOU SEEN BURKE?

03:36.833 --> 03:38.500
NO.

03:38.533 --> 03:39.700
HAVE YOU SEEN DEREK?

03:39.733 --> 03:40.900
NO.

03:40.933 --> 03:43.367
WAIT, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN EITHER
OF THEM SINCE THE WEDDING?

03:43.400 --> 03:45.400
(Cristina and Meredith) NOPE.
AND YOU'RE ALL FINE?

03:45.433 --> 03:47.433
(Cristina and Meredith) YEP.
WOW.

03:47.467 --> 03:50.233
YOU'RE EITHER INCREDIBLY HEALTHY
OR COMPLETELY MESSED UP.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.433
(pagers beeping)

03:57.100 --> 03:58.833
YOUR INTERNS ARE BACK
FROM HOLIDAY TODAY.

03:58.867 --> 04:00.767
UH, NOT MY INTERNS.
THEY'RE RESIDENTS. I'M FREE.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.667
RIGHT. WELL--HERE, NURSE.
THE POINT IS, UH, DR. YANG.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.600
THE BURKE THING--
SHE DOESN'T KNOW.

04:05.633 --> 04:08.500
I'M SUPPOSED TO TELL HER.
BURKE ASKED ME TO TELL HER.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.200
ANY THOUGHTS?

04:10.233 --> 04:11.400
HONESTY ALWAYS WORKS BEST.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.233
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

04:13.267 --> 04:16.133
YOU WANT TO GET TOGETHER
FOR A DRINK AFTER WORK TONIGHT?
WHY?

04:16.167 --> 04:18.300
WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I JUST
THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA

04:18.333 --> 04:21.200
TO GET TOGETHER AND HAVE--
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYBODY TO TALK TO.

04:21.233 --> 04:23.667
NO, I HAVE PEOPLE TO TALK TO.
ADDISON IS GONE,
BURKE ISN'T AROUND,

04:23.700 --> 04:25.633
AND YOU AND GREY
AREN'T SMELLING EACH OTHER

04:25.667 --> 04:28.233
IN THE ELEVATORS ANYMORE.
I HAVE PEOPLE TO TALK TO.

04:28.267 --> 04:29.633
WHO?
I HAVE...

04:29.667 --> 04:31.600
CHIEF. I-I HAVE THE CHIEF
TO TALK TO.

04:31.633 --> 04:34.167
HEY, CHIEF. WANT TO GET TOGETHER
FOR A DRINK AFTER WORK?
I DON'T DRINK.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.267
DR. BAILEY, WE NEED TO TALK.
WE HAVE TRAUMAS COMING IN.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.400
YOU'RE AVOIDING ME.
WE NEED TO TALK.

04:38.433 --> 04:41.033
ABOUT YOU CHOOSING DR. TORRES TO
BE YOUR CHIEF RESIDENT OVER ME?

04:41.067 --> 04:43.133
RESPECTFULLY, NO, SIR. WE'RE NOT
GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

04:43.167 --> 04:45.433
SOMEONE MENTION A DRINK LATER?
'CAUSE I'M IN.
NOBODY MENTIONED A DRINK.

04:45.467 --> 04:47.600
YOU MENTIONED A DRINK.
I DID NOT MENTION A DRINK.

04:47.633 --> 04:49.100
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

04:49.133 --> 04:51.433
WE'VE GOT THREE M.V.C.s
ROLLING IN BACK-TO-BACK

04:51.467 --> 04:53.533
FROM A MULTICAR PILEUP.

04:53.567 --> 04:55.567
WE NEED EVERY TRAUMA ROOM OPEN
AND EVERYONE SUITED UP.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.500
IS THERE ANYTHING
I-I SHOULD DO, SIR?

04:57.533 --> 04:59.167
SAVE LIVES.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.533
NO. I MEAN AS, UH,
CHIEF RESIDENT.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.233
ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?

05:02.267 --> 05:04.200
MAKE SURE YOUR RESIDENTS
RUN THEIR TRAUMAS.

05:04.233 --> 05:06.133
THIS IS THEIR FIRST DAY
ON THEIR OWN.

05:06.167 --> 05:07.700
WHERE...

05:07.733 --> 05:11.133
ARE THE RESIDENTS
YOU'VE ASSIGNED TO THIS E.R.?

05:11.167 --> 05:14.567
OH. OH, I, UH, I, UH,
I PAGED THEM. I--

05:14.600 --> 05:16.500
I PAGED THEM. BAILEY?
WHAT?

05:16.533 --> 05:19.400
UH, I, UH, PAGED, UH, GREY,
YANG, STEVENS AND KAREV,

05:19.433 --> 05:21.333
BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE YET.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.267
WHEN I PAGE 'EM,
THEY COME RUNNING.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.500
GET IT TOGETHER, TORRES.

05:24.533 --> 05:27.133
YES, SIR.

05:27.167 --> 05:29.067
OKAY, YOU DID NOT
HAVE TO SAY THAT

05:29.100 --> 05:30.300
IN FRONT OF THE CHIEF.

05:30.333 --> 05:33.567
YOU ASKED... BOSS.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.733
THERE'S DEREK.
IS BURKE WITH HIM?

05:35.767 --> 05:37.667
I DON'T SEE HIM.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

05:37.700 --> 05:40.767
WE HAVE MULTIPLE M.V.C.s
DUE ANY SECOND.
(Alex) WE'RE HERE, AREN'T WE?

05:40.800 --> 05:42.667
WE'RE HERE.
ALL RIGHT. JUST--
JUST GET READY, OKAY?

05:42.700 --> 05:44.333
AND MONITOR YOUR INTERNS.

05:44.367 --> 05:46.100
OKAY, ONE, TWO,
GO GET STAT PACKS.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.400
UH, THREE, FOUR,
GO MEET THE AMBULANCES.

05:48.433 --> 05:49.800
"ONE AND TWO"?

05:49.833 --> 05:52.667
NO, I CAN'T REMEMBER
THEIR NAMES.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.833
I DON'T RESPOND
TO BEING CALLED A NUMBER.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.833
GEORGE,
GO WAIT FOR THE AMBULANCE.

05:56.867 --> 05:59.467
THE REST OF YOU
COME WITH ME.
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS
STAND AGAINST THE WALL

05:59.500 --> 06:01.767
AND OUT OF THE WAY
UNLESS I CALL FOR YOU.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.233
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT'S CALLED
A TRAUMA SITUATION.

06:04.267 --> 06:06.167
SO THERE'S GONNA BE
LOTS OF ACTIVITY

06:06.200 --> 06:07.367
AND A LOT OF PATIENTS,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.467
SO IF YOU GUYS HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL,

06:09.500 --> 06:11.067
JUST ASK, OKAY?

06:12.367 --> 06:14.367
I HEARD SHE, LIKE, FREAKED OUT
AND KILLED A GUY

06:14.400 --> 06:16.300
AND HAD TO GO ON PROBATION.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.667
(woman) GREAT.
WE'RE STUCK WITH A DUD.

06:19.867 --> 06:22.633
SO, HEY, YOU'RE
AN INTERN... AGAIN.
YEAH.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.567
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.
THE OTHER INTERNS, I WON'T--
THAT'S--THAT'S OKAY.
DOESN'T MATTER.

06:25.600 --> 06:28.100
DO YOU KNOW
WHICH ONE IS MEREDITH GREY?

06:28.133 --> 06:30.433
YEAH, I HAVEN'T, UH,
TOLD HER YOU'RE HERE YET.

06:30.467 --> 06:32.767
I WAS GOING TO...
SO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.700
YEAH, I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.633
WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
I-I MEAN, IS SHE NICE?

06:36.667 --> 06:38.567
'CAUSE--'CAUSE MY DAD,
HE WON'T--HE WON'T TELL ME.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.067
IS SH--SH...

06:42.467 --> 06:45.167
UH, GREY, DON'T LET THEM
JUST STAND HERE.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.567
LET'S MOVE, PEOPLE.

06:49.833 --> 06:51.733
UNRESTRAINED DRIVER,
D.O.A. AT THE SCENE.

06:51.767 --> 06:54.433
JUST NEED SOMEONE
TO PRONOUNCE HIM.
OH, CRAP.

06:54.467 --> 06:57.167
DEAD GUY. WHY'D YOU GET ME
ALL EXCITED WITH THE SIRENS?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.100
OKAY, WHO WANTS TO SEE
A DEAD GUY?

06:59.133 --> 07:01.033
NANCY WALTERS, 34 YEARS OLD,
35 WEEKS PREGNANT.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.267
COMPLETE
UPPER ARM AMPUTATION.

07:02.300 --> 07:05.100
PRESSURE DRESSINGS APPLIED.
TWO LARGE BORE I.V.s STARTED.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.700
DID HE SAY "ARM"?
MY ARM IS GONE?

07:07.733 --> 07:09.800
MISS WALTERS,
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

07:09.833 --> 07:12.600
GREY, CHECK THE WOUND.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.533
I REALLY NEED MY ARM.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.433
(man) 45-YEAR-OLD MALE,
SUSTAINED A KNEE INJURY.

07:16.467 --> 07:19.500
THAT GUY, THE GUY THAT'S DEAD,
HE HIT A DEER,

07:19.533 --> 07:22.267
AND THEN THE LADY HIT HIM,
AND THEN I HIT THE LADY.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.267
(groans)
KNEE IS BLOWING UP
LIKE A BALLOON.

07:24.300 --> 07:27.200
HEY, I'M HUNGRY.
CAN I GET SOMETHING TO EAT?
(siren wails)

07:27.233 --> 07:29.100
OKAY,
EVERYBODY GET A GOOD LOOK?

07:29.133 --> 07:30.600
TIME OF DEATH--8:22.

07:30.633 --> 07:32.733
(inhales and exhales sharply)

07:32.767 --> 07:35.567
NOT TIME OF DEATH.
THIS GUY IS NOT DEAD.
(man) HE WAS DEAD.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.233
WELL, HE'S NOT DEAD NOW. LET'S
BAG HIM. OKAY, WE'VE GOT A--

07:37.267 --> 07:41.267
WE'VE GOT A GUY WHO'S RISEN
FROM THE DEAD OVER HERE.
(Meredith) GET OUTTA THE WAY!

07:41.300 --> 07:43.067
ARE--ARE YOU MEREDITH GREY?
YEAH.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.533
I--I'M LEXIE.
GREAT. MOVE.

07:44.567 --> 07:48.133
LEXIE GREY.
I'M--I'M YOUR SISTER.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.300
(keyboard keys clicking)

08:07.800 --> 08:11.267
THAT GIRL OUT THERE,
THE DOPEY, WIDE-EYED ONE?

08:11.300 --> 08:12.733
APPARENTLY WE'RE RELATED.

08:12.767 --> 08:14.233
OH, YOU--YOU MET LEXIE?

08:14.267 --> 08:17.100
OH, YOU KNEW. KNEW ABOUT IT
AND DIDN'T TELL ME, HUH?

08:17.133 --> 08:18.833
I'VE... KIND OF HAD
A LOT GOING ON.

08:18.867 --> 08:19.767
THIS IS TRAUMA ROOM ONE.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.033
AS YOU CAN SEE, IT'S--
THERE'S A TRAUMA.

08:22.067 --> 08:24.233
HEY, GUYS,
DO YOU NEED SOME HELP?

08:24.267 --> 08:27.133
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU NEED SOME HELP.
IT'S A LITTLE CROWDED
IN HERE ALREADY, IZ.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.800
(Mark groans)
WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME?

08:28.833 --> 08:32.333
(Meredith) UH, NANCY WALTERS.
COMPLETE AMPUTATION.
(George) THE BABY LOOKS FINE,

08:32.367 --> 08:34.400
BUT SHE'S HAVING
SOME CONTRACTIONS.

08:34.433 --> 08:37.167
HI, NANCY. I'M DR. SLOAN.
YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK?
IT'S A CLEAN CUT.

08:37.200 --> 08:40.367
YOU WANT TO RUB UP AGAINST ME,
YOU GOTTA BUY ME A DRINK FIRST.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.300
HANG ANTIBIOTICS AND PUT ON
A STERILE, MOIST DRESSING.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.800
THERE'S A CHANCE
AT A GOOD RECOVERY HERE.

08:43.833 --> 08:46.300
DO WE HAVE AN ARM?
THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IT.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.200
MY BABY HAS NO FATHER.
HE'S ALREADY DOWN TWO ARMS.

08:49.233 --> 08:53.500
SO HE R-REALLY NEEDS ME
TO HAVE AN ARM.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.767
GET ME THAT ARM.

08:57.733 --> 09:01.233
OKAY, SOMEBODY SET UP FOR
A TRAUMATIC EFFUSION DRAINAGE.
AH... (mutters)

09:01.267 --> 09:03.133
AND ORDER HIM
4 OF MORPHINE.

09:03.167 --> 09:05.167
(whistles)
SHE MEANS ONE OF YOU MORONS.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.667
GET HER AN 18 GAUGE NEEDLE
AND A 20 cc SYRINGE

09:07.700 --> 09:10.833
AND THE DAMN MORPHINE.
(scoffs)
HEY, UH, MORPHINE'S COOL,

09:10.867 --> 09:13.067
BUT I'D KILL
FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.567
A HEALTHY APPETITE
AFTER A TRAUMA LIKE THIS?

09:15.600 --> 09:18.433
THAT'S A VERY GOOD SIGN,
JOEY.
YOU THINK HE'LL NEED SURGERY?

09:18.467 --> 09:20.467
THAT DEPENDS ON THE X-RAYS.
(clears throat)

09:26.067 --> 09:27.400
(Callie) KNEE LOOKS GOOD.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.767
NO SURGERY.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.300
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

09:33.333 --> 09:35.433
OKAY. THIS IS CRISTINA--
DR. YANG.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.433
THIS IS DR. YANG.
SHE'S WORKING.

09:37.467 --> 09:40.600
YEP, SAVING LIVES
AND TAKING NAMES.

09:40.633 --> 09:42.700
(lowers voice) SO...
I HAVE THESE INTERNS

09:42.733 --> 09:44.633
AND NOTHING TO DO.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.567
AND, UH, I THINK
I'M A REALLY BAD TEACHER.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.467
AND I THINK THEY HATE ME.
AND NOW I'M A FRAUD.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.367
SO ANY CHANCE YOU WANNA
LET ME IN ON THIS? PLEASE.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.300
(low voice)
IZZIE, THIS GUY WAS DEAD,

09:55.333 --> 09:56.667
AND NOW HE'S UNDEAD.

09:56.700 --> 09:59.167
SO THAT KINDA MAKES HIM
LIKE A ZOMBIE--

09:59.200 --> 10:01.067
MY PERSONAL ZOMBIE.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.567
SO NO, YOU CAN'T
GET IN ON THIS.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.833
NOW GO BE A...
(loudly) FRAUD SOMEWHERE ELSE.

10:04.867 --> 10:06.500
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.433
MM-HMM.
(Izzie with normal voice)
LET'S GO, PEOPLE.

10:08.467 --> 10:09.667
EXCUSE ME.

10:09.700 --> 10:12.567
YOU KNOW, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THESE.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.500
I GOT--I WAS--
I MET MY SISTER,

10:14.533 --> 10:16.633
UH, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER...
OH, HEY.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.567
WHICH, UH, GOT ME,
YOU KNOW, WEIRD.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.467
SO THEN I GOT, UM, LOST
ON MY WAY TO X-RAY

10:20.500 --> 10:22.400
'CAUSE I WAS ALL IN MY HEAD,

10:22.433 --> 10:24.333
YOU KNOW, ABOUT--
ABOUT MEETING MEREDITH.

10:24.367 --> 10:26.267
MEREDITH IS YOUR--
IS YOUR SISTER?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.267
MEREDITH GREY. LEXIE GREY.
WE'RE HALF SISTERS.

10:28.300 --> 10:30.367

10:37.467 --> 10:38.767

10:38.800 --> 10:40.300
SEATTLE GRACE.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.667
THANK YOU.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.600
HI.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.400
HOW ARE YOU?
I HAVE A PATIENT
WITH A SEVERED ARM,

10:46.433 --> 10:49.433
AND NO ONE SEEMS TO BE ABLE
TO FIND IT. HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

10:49.467 --> 10:52.033
YOUR SEVERED ARM? NO,
I HAVEN'T SEEN A SEVERED ARM.

10:52.067 --> 10:54.433
MEREDITH, HOW--
HEY, UM, I'M--I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT BEFORE.

10:54.467 --> 10:56.167
I JUST WAS SO NERVOUS
ABOUT MEETING YOU.

10:56.200 --> 10:58.267
DON'T BLOCK THE E.R. DOORS.
I KNOW THAT NOW.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.167
THAT WAS A GOOD LESSON.
YOU'RE THE GIRL
FROM THE BAR.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.267
SORRY?
THE GIRL FROM THE BAR?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.700
OH, MY GOD. YEAH.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.267
OH, MY GOD. YEAH.
YEAH.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.033
(Lexie laughs) OH, MY GOD.
(Derek chuckles)

11:08.067 --> 11:09.533
YOU--YOU WORK HERE.
YEAH, I DO.

11:09.567 --> 11:12.833
GIRL FROM THE BAR?
MM-HMM.

11:12.867 --> 11:16.067
I'M THE GIRL FROM THE BAR.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.067
UH...

11:19.100 --> 11:22.167
SHE HATES ME.
MY SISTER HATES ME.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.167
MEREDITH IS YOUR SISTER?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.833
MY HALF SISTER, YEAH.
OH.

11:25.867 --> 11:28.133
HEY, UH, YOU'RE DR. SHEPHERD.
THAT'S RIGHT.

11:28.167 --> 11:30.500
I'M--I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
FINDING YOU FOR A CONSULT.

11:30.533 --> 11:31.533
(sighs)

11:31.567 --> 11:33.700
HEY. THERE YOU ARE.
I MISSED YOU THIS MORNING.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.633
YEAH,
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LATE

11:35.667 --> 11:37.767
FOR MY SECOND FIRST DAY
AS AN INTERN.

11:37.800 --> 11:39.667
MAYBE YOU CAN LOOK AT IT
LIKE THIS--

11:39.700 --> 11:41.600
YOU HAVE ONE UP ON EVERYONE.

11:41.633 --> 11:44.333
YOU'RE GONNA BE, LIKE,
THE ROCK STAR INTERN.
YEAH, I'M SURE THAT'S HOW

11:44.367 --> 11:46.400
EVERYONE'S GONNA SEE ME
WHEN THEY FIND OUT.

11:46.433 --> 11:49.300
OR MAYBE THEY'LL SEE YOU
AS THE DADDY INTERN.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.067
WHAT?

11:51.100 --> 11:53.700
WH-WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

11:53.733 --> 11:55.267
OH...

11:55.300 --> 11:57.300
I'M NOT--I'M NOT PREGNANT.
I JUST...

11:59.100 --> 12:01.400
I MEAN, I MIGHT BE PREGNANT.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.800
YEAH, MY BOOBS
ARE A LITTLE SORE, WHICH...

12:05.467 --> 12:07.533
HEY, I'M TRYING
TO CHEER YOU UP HERE, GEORGE.

12:07.567 --> 12:10.467
THIS IS--I MEAN,
IF I AM KNOCKED UP,

12:10.500 --> 12:13.133
THAT'S A GOOD THING, RIGHT?
CALLIE, I'M JUST
A LITTLE DISTRACTED.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.567
I'M HAVING A BAD DAY.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.500
OKAY, YOU'RE HAVING
A BAD MONTH.

12:17.533 --> 12:20.167
OKAY,
I'M HAVING A BAD MONTH.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.500
LOVE YOU.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.467
(door closes)

12:24.500 --> 12:26.600
HELP! WE NEED DOCTORS.
HELP!

12:26.633 --> 12:29.233
INSIDE VOICE. UH, WE FOUND
AN ARM IN THE ROAD.

12:29.267 --> 12:30.600
HERE, I BAGGED THAT--

12:30.633 --> 12:32.500
THAT'S MY ARM.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.433
(boy) DAD, DAD,
TELL THEM SHE'S HURT!

12:34.467 --> 12:36.633
DAD, COME ON. TELL THE DOCTOR!
TELL 'EM SHE'S HURT.

12:36.667 --> 12:39.367
UH, ANY WAY WE CAN GO
WITH THE SEVERED ARM?
SHE'S IN THE TRUCK,
AND SHE'S HURT.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.600
IS THAT YOUR BLOOD?
ARE YOU HURT?

12:41.633 --> 12:44.067
SHE'S IN OUR TRUCK,
AND SHE'S NOT MOVING.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.100
PLEASE.
SHE'S BLEEDING REALLY BAD.

12:46.133 --> 12:48.567
THERE'S ANOTHER CRASH VICTIM.
WE'RE GONNA NEED GLOVES, I.V.s,

12:48.600 --> 12:50.800
GAUZE, AB PADS, TRAUMA GOWNS.

12:50.833 --> 12:53.433
STILL WANT TO BABYSIT THE ARM?

12:56.500 --> 12:58.433
(man) MICHAEL!

12:58.467 --> 13:00.733
NO WAY.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.500
(interns sigh)

13:03.533 --> 13:05.267
(Michael) IS SHE DEAD?

13:07.100 --> 13:11.033
MICHAEL, THIS IS A HOSPITAL,
AND I'M A PEOPLE DOCTOR.

13:11.067 --> 13:12.400
I...

13:12.433 --> 13:14.133
CAN YOU SAVE HER?

13:14.167 --> 13:15.700
MICHAEL, COME ON.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.200
I'M SORRY, BUT SHE'S--

13:17.233 --> 13:19.067
ROADKILL.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.233
(Michael) SHE OPENED HER EYES.

13:22.267 --> 13:24.133
LOOK.
SHE'S STILL ALIVE!

13:24.167 --> 13:26.833
(panting)

13:26.867 --> 13:29.233
OH, GOD.
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.633
(panting continues)

13:31.667 --> 13:34.500
OR LIKE THAT.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.800
MICHAEL, LET'S GO BACK
TO THE TRUCK. COME ON.
PLEASE.

13:36.833 --> 13:39.433
OH, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.300
UH, I'M GONNA NEED
A JUMBO CATHETER,

13:41.333 --> 13:44.433
A 16 GAUGE NEEDLE, THE BIGGEST
AMBU BAG YOU CAN FIND

13:44.467 --> 13:46.800
AND SOMETHING THAT SHAVES FUR.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.567
(deer panting)

13:48.600 --> 13:50.500
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

13:50.533 --> 13:53.267
WHEN I SAY MOVE, YOU MOVE.
MOVE!

13:56.167 --> 13:57.767
THE BACK OF HIS SKULL
IS COMPLETELY DISCONNECTED

13:57.800 --> 13:59.167
FROM HIS FIRST
CERVICAL VERTEBRAE.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.800
HE'S BEEN INTERNALLY
DECAPITATED. HOLY CRAP.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.633
YEAH, 90% OF THESE
DIE IN THE FIELD.
AND THE OTHER 10%?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.733
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE LIVE.
THERE'S ALWAYS
A FIRST TIME, THOUGH, RIGHT?

14:05.767 --> 14:08.233
I MEAN,
HE CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.600
HENRY, I'M DR. SHEPHERD.

14:12.633 --> 14:16.700
THE BACK OF YOUR SKULL
IS DISCONNECTED FROM YOUR SPINE.

14:16.733 --> 14:18.633
I'M GONNA TRY AND RECONNECT IT
IN SURGERY.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.300
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

14:20.333 --> 14:22.200
BLINK ONCE FOR YES,
TWICE FOR NO.

14:22.233 --> 14:24.200
OKAY, GOOD.

14:24.233 --> 14:26.133
I KNOW IT'S SCARY,
BUT I PROMISE YOU,

14:26.167 --> 14:27.833
I'M GONNA DO
EVERYTHING I CAN.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.733
DO YOU HAVE FAMILY?

14:29.767 --> 14:32.700
ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA
CONTACT THEM, OKAY?

14:32.733 --> 14:34.633
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM
IN A HALO.

14:34.667 --> 14:36.500
(Cristina) UH-HUH.
CONTACT HIS FAMILY.

14:36.533 --> 14:39.267
(lowers voice) FIND OUT
IF HE'S AN ORGAN DONOR.
ALL RIGHT.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.267
YOU, FINISH UP WITH THE SPLINT,
THEN GET HIM UP ON CRUTCHES.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.167
HEY.
HEY.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.433
HOW'S JOEY?
IT'S A HUNGRY HIPPO
MISSING A KNEECAP.

14:53.467 --> 14:56.100
CAN'T YOU ASSIGN ME
SOMETHING GOOD?
I DON'T
SWITCH OUT PATIENTS, KAREV.

14:56.133 --> 14:58.600
BUT IT'S NOT EVEN SURGICAL.
IT'S A WASTE OF MY SKILLS.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.200
YOU'RE STAYING HERE
WITH JOEY.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.433
COME ON.
NO!

15:01.467 --> 15:03.367
FINE. I'M GOING TO BAILEY.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.567
YOU ARE A RESIDENT.
YOU GO WHERE I SAY.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.133
(crying) MY ARM IS GONE.

15:11.167 --> 15:13.567
(Meredith) WE HAVE THE ARM,
AND DR. SLOAN

15:13.600 --> 15:16.533
IS CHECKING RIGHT NOW TO SEE
IF WE CAN REATTACH IT.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.467
IS THERE SOMEONE WE CAN CALL?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.800
THERE'S NO...

15:19.833 --> 15:21.533
NO, I JUST...

15:21.567 --> 15:23.467
I JUST MOVED HERE. I'M ALL--

15:23.500 --> 15:26.400
I'M ALL BY MYSELF.
THERE'S NO ONE. I HAVE NO ONE.

15:26.433 --> 15:29.300
WELL, DR. SLOAN
SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE.

15:29.333 --> 15:32.167
I WANTED A KID AND...

15:32.200 --> 15:35.567
I WAS SICK OF WAITING
FOR THE RIGHT GUY, SO...

15:35.600 --> 15:38.200
IN MY FAMILY...

15:38.233 --> 15:41.100
IN MY FAMILY, YOU DON'T
GO OUT AND GET PREGNANT.

15:41.133 --> 15:43.400
SO NOW I'M ALONE AND...

15:43.433 --> 15:44.600
I'M HAVING A BABY,

15:44.633 --> 15:47.300
AND I DON'T HAVE A FATHER
FOR THE BABY,

15:47.333 --> 15:49.233
AND I DON'T HAVE AN ARM.
(crying)

15:49.267 --> 15:51.400
IT'S OKAY.
HERE'S DR. SLOAN.

15:51.433 --> 15:53.567
NANCY... I'M HAPPY TO REPORT

15:53.600 --> 15:56.333
THAT YOUR ARM IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

15:56.367 --> 15:58.600
DR. GREY HERE IS GONNA
CLEAN IT UP A LITTLE,

15:58.633 --> 16:01.733
AND--AND I'M GONNA PUT THAT ARM
BACK WHERE IT BELONGS, OKAY?

16:01.767 --> 16:04.633
OKAY.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.633
OKAY.

16:06.667 --> 16:09.500
WE GOT
A 150-POUND FEMALE WITH...

16:09.533 --> 16:12.433
LACERATIONS ON THE CHEST
AND HAUNCHES,

16:12.467 --> 16:14.300
SHORT, FAST BREATHS.
ANY RECOMMENDATIONS?

16:14.333 --> 16:16.167
UH, DOCTOR,
MICHAEL'S A BIG BOY.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.500
HE DOESN'T NEED YOU
TO PERFORM

16:17.533 --> 16:19.233
MAKE-BELIEVE MEDICINE,
RIGHT, MICHAEL?

16:19.267 --> 16:21.133
(Michael) IT'S NOT MAKE-BELIEVE.
SHE CAN HELP.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.033
MICHAEL, ENOUGH. I APOLOGIZE.
WE'RE JUST WASTING YOUR TIME.

16:23.067 --> 16:24.167
COME ON.
NO KIDDING.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.500
MICHAEL.

16:25.533 --> 16:26.567
PLEASE DON'T LET HER DIE.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.133
MICHAEL, IT IS A DEER.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE HER HOME

16:30.167 --> 16:32.500
AND SKIN HER
AND FREEZE THE MEAT, OKAY?
WHAT? WHY?!

16:32.533 --> 16:34.633
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.667
YOU DON'T TRY AND SAVE 'EM.
YOU EAT 'EM.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.400
NO, DAD.
THE DOCTOR CAN SAVE HER.
NO, SHE CAN'T.

16:39.433 --> 16:42.367
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
MY SON NEEDS TO LEARN
TO GROW UP AND FACE THINGS.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.267
YOU'RE NOT HELPING HIM
RIGHT NOW. YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:44.300 --> 16:46.200
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM NOT HELPING HIM.

16:46.233 --> 16:48.067
I'M HELPING BAMBI.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.233
SO GET ME THE AMBU BAG
AND THE SALINE.

16:50.267 --> 16:51.700
I'M STARTING AN I.V.

16:51.733 --> 16:54.500
THANK YOU.

16:54.533 --> 16:58.400
***

16:58.433 --> 17:00.033
STILL NO SIGN OF BURKE.

17:00.067 --> 17:01.800
OH, YOU'VE GOT
A SEVERED ARM.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.367
MY ARM. MINE.
GET AWAY FROM IT.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.233
MAYBE HE'S NOT ON TODAY.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST SEE HIM
AND GET IT OVER WITH.

17:06.267 --> 17:08.767
NO, NO, NO, NO. IF I NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN, I WON'T CARE.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.100
WELL, I'VE SEEN DEREK,
AND DEREK HAS SEEN ME.
AND?

17:11.133 --> 17:13.100
AWKWARD.
PLUS HE SEEMS TO KNOW LEXIE.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.667
AND?
MORE AWKWARD.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.100
YOUR INTERN IS MY HALF SISTER.
HOW WEIRD IS THAT?

17:17.133 --> 17:19.567
WELL, I'M TRYING TO SAVE
BAMBI'S LIFE.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.533
MY INTERNS THINK I'M A LOSER.
SEVERED ARM.

17:21.567 --> 17:23.500
CALLIE'S A BITCH.
WORD.

17:23.533 --> 17:25.233
SHE WON'T LET ME OFF
MY PATIENT,

17:25.267 --> 17:27.167
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH HIM EXCEPT HE'S A NUT JOB.

17:27.200 --> 17:29.300
SEVERED ARM.
DOES ANYBODY KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT DEER?

17:29.333 --> 17:31.167
THEY TASTE GOOD.
EVIL.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.067
***

17:33.100 --> 17:34.267
OH, GEORGE, SEVERED ARM.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.767
PLUS MER'S HALF SISTER
IS MY INTERN,

17:35.800 --> 17:38.433
IZZIE IS PLAYING
DR. DOLITTLE,

17:38.467 --> 17:40.267
OH, AND ALEX HATES
YOUR WIFE.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.467
DR. SLOAN'S READY
FOR THE ARM.

17:42.500 --> 17:46.233
I'LL SAY IT.
GEORGE IS BEING AN ASS.
(Izzie) I THINK IT'S MY FAULT.

17:46.267 --> 17:49.767
I SAID SOME THINGS, AND NOW
HE'S NOT TALKING TO ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S GOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT.

17:49.800 --> 17:52.367
THOSE NEW CHICK INTERNS ARE HOT.
HE'S MARRIED, ALEX.

17:52.400 --> 17:54.067
YEAH, HE'S MARRIED.

17:54.100 --> 17:56.733
YOU KNOW WHO'S SERIOUSLY HOT?
THAT LEXIE GIRL.

17:56.767 --> 17:59.433
GET OUT...
BEFORE I HURT YOU.
(Cristina snickers)

17:59.467 --> 18:01.767
I'M GOING OVER CALLIE'S HEAD
TO BAILEY.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.633
UH, CALLIE
IS OVER BAILEY'S HEAD.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.633
SPIRITUALLY, BAILEY'S OVER
EVERYONE'S HEAD.

18:06.667 --> 18:08.367
(Bailey) TRAUMAS...

18:08.400 --> 18:10.300
DR. BAILEY.
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?

18:10.333 --> 18:12.667
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
ASK DR. TORRES.

18:12.700 --> 18:13.600
MIRANDA--

18:13.633 --> 18:15.267
I DON'T WANT TO TALK.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.800
MIRANDA, IT IS NOT LIKE YOU
NOT TO WANT TO TALK.

18:17.833 --> 18:20.067
FINE. HOW'S YOUR WIFE?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.267
WELL, SHE'S...

18:21.300 --> 18:23.033
SHE'S... GOOD.

18:23.067 --> 18:25.500
I HAVEN'T MOVED BACK IN YET.

18:25.533 --> 18:27.733
SHE HASN'T LET ME
MOVE BACK IN YET.

18:27.767 --> 18:29.400
SHE'S NOT TAKING MY CALLS.

18:29.433 --> 18:32.300
WAIT. THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.133
I WANT TO TALK ABOUT
CHIEF RESIDENT.

18:34.167 --> 18:36.300
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION.
ARE YOU ORDERING ME

18:36.333 --> 18:39.700
TO STAND HERE AND TALK TO YOU
ABOUT THIS, CHIEF?
NO, I'M NOT ORDERING YOU.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.100
BUT I JUST THOUGHT WE COULD--
OKAY, THEN. GOOD-BYE, SIR.

18:42.133 --> 18:44.767
***

18:44.800 --> 18:47.100
I TALKED TO THE FAMILY.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY.

18:47.133 --> 18:49.667
GOOD. I PUT AN ENTIRE O.R. ON
HOLD. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.600
UH, CAN I GET
A PROGRESS NOTE?

18:51.633 --> 18:53.533
UH, DO YOU MAYBE WANT TO
HAVE A DRINK LATER?

18:53.567 --> 18:54.633
WHAT?

18:54.667 --> 18:57.600
A DRINK. GIVE ME ONE REASON
WHY WE CAN'T HANG OUT.

18:57.633 --> 18:59.267
I DON'T LIKE YOU.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.200
YOU DON'T LIKE ME
BECAUSE OF MEREDITH?

19:02.233 --> 19:04.067
I DON'T LIKE YOU
BECAUSE YOU'RE YOU.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.367
HMM.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.833
HOW IS MEREDITH,
BY THE WAY? IS SHE OKAY?

19:07.867 --> 19:09.233
SHE'S FINE.

19:09.267 --> 19:11.433
SHE'S ALWAYS FINE.
THAT'S HER PROBLEM.

19:11.467 --> 19:13.633
WE'RE FINE PEOPLE.
WE DO FINE.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.467
WE'RE FINE.

19:19.133 --> 19:22.033
HOW'S DR. BURKE?
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM AROUND.

19:22.067 --> 19:23.367
IS--IS HE OFF TODAY?

19:25.433 --> 19:27.067
HERE.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.567
DR. BURKE HANDED IN
HIS LETTER OF RESIGNATION

19:29.600 --> 19:30.767
TWO WEEKS AGO.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.833
HE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.767
HE'S G-GONE?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.833
I'M SORRY.

19:36.867 --> 19:38.500
WELL, DON'T BE. I'M--

19:38.533 --> 19:39.567
FINE?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.533
YEAH.

20:02.333 --> 20:04.233
CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
OF A DEER?

20:04.267 --> 20:05.633
SHUT UP.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.200
OH, DR. BAILEY.

20:07.233 --> 20:09.133
UH, COULDN'T YOU USE
AN EXTRA SET OF HANDS

20:09.167 --> 20:10.633
IN THE O.R. TODAY?

20:10.667 --> 20:12.833
I SAW AN APPY ON THE BOARD.
I'M--I'M GREAT AT APPYS.

20:12.867 --> 20:15.600
TALK TO TORRES. SHE'S IN CHARGE
OF WHAT CASES YOU GET NOW.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.533
IT'S HARD TO SET
A SHATTERED KNEECAP

20:17.567 --> 20:19.467
WHEN YOUR PATIENT'S IN THE PIT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

20:19.500 --> 20:20.800
(clears throat)

20:20.833 --> 20:22.600
(quietly) WHATEVER.

20:22.633 --> 20:24.433
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DID IT.

20:24.467 --> 20:26.100
DID WHAT?

20:26.133 --> 20:29.333
GET 'EM TO LISTEN TO YOU,
TO GIVE YOU SOME RESPECT.

20:32.100 --> 20:35.733
HEY, DR. BAILEY,
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW

20:35.767 --> 20:40.733
ANYTHING ABOUT, UH,
THE ANATOMY OF A DEER?

20:40.767 --> 20:45.567
NOT MY INTERN,
NOT MY BUSINESS, NOT ANYMORE.

20:47.233 --> 20:49.133
YOUR HUSBAND'S INJURIES
ARE S-SEVERE.

20:49.167 --> 20:52.100
UH, THEY'RE TRAUMATIC
IN THE EXTREME.

20:52.133 --> 20:54.767
I'M SORRY.
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

20:54.800 --> 20:57.800
THE ONLY THING HOLDING
HIS HEAD ON TO HIS BODY

20:57.833 --> 20:59.033
IS SKIN AND MUSCLE.

20:59.067 --> 21:02.100
IF HE MOVES EVEN A FRACTION OF
AN INCH, IT COULD KILL HIM.

21:02.133 --> 21:04.033
S-SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT THE--

21:04.067 --> 21:05.767
I'M--I'M SAYING THAT

21:05.800 --> 21:09.367
WHEN YOU SEE HIM,
THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME--

21:09.400 --> 21:12.267
THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME
YOU SEE HIM ALIVE.

21:12.300 --> 21:15.300
(cries)

21:17.867 --> 21:20.167
(woman)
ARE YOU IN PAIN, SWEETIE?

21:21.867 --> 21:23.200
GOOD.

21:23.233 --> 21:26.633
TWO BLINKS--
YOU AREN'T IN PAIN.

21:26.667 --> 21:29.367
WHY ISN'T DADDY ANSWERING?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.300
JUST--
RIGHT NOW WE JUST NEED

21:31.333 --> 21:32.833
TO WISH DADDY GOOD LUCK
IN HIS SURGERY

21:32.867 --> 21:34.733
AND TELL HIM
HOW MUCH WE LOVE HIM.

21:34.767 --> 21:36.233
OKAY?
(mouths word)

21:36.267 --> 21:38.367
'CAUSE WE DO.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.367
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, HENRY.

21:47.267 --> 21:49.600
WHAT'S--WHAT'S THREE BLINKS?

21:49.633 --> 21:53.133
UH, WE'VE ONLY BEEN WORKING
WITH ONE AND TWO.
RIGHT.

21:55.433 --> 21:57.333
IS IT "I LOVE YOU"?

21:57.367 --> 22:01.033
ARE YOU TELLING US YOU LOVE US?

22:01.067 --> 22:04.233
(woman) THREE BLINKS IS
I LOVE YOU.

22:06.067 --> 22:09.600
WE'RE GONNA BE FINE, HENRY.

22:09.633 --> 22:10.833
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT,

22:10.867 --> 22:14.367
AND WE'RE ALL
GONNA BE JUST FINE.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.433
(Derek) IT'S TIME TO GO.

22:16.467 --> 22:20.533
OKAY, GUYS. LET'S LET
THESE DOCTORS FIX DADDY UP.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.100
(sobs)

22:54.800 --> 22:56.067
GEORGE.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.833
HEY.

22:57.867 --> 22:59.667
GEORGE...

22:59.700 --> 23:01.700
WHY ARE YOU AVOIDING ME?

23:01.733 --> 23:03.600
I'M ON MY WAY TO SURGERY.

23:03.633 --> 23:06.367
NO, I DON'T MEAN RIGHT NOW.
I MEAN...

23:06.400 --> 23:10.400
NOT ONE WORD IN 17 DAYS?

23:10.433 --> 23:14.333
I TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU,
AND NOT ONE WORD?

23:14.367 --> 23:16.267
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I'VE BEEN RIGHT HERE.

23:16.300 --> 23:19.067
YOU KNOW WHERE? EXACTLY WHERE
I WAS A YEAR AGO.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.167
I'M SORRY. I...

23:22.200 --> 23:24.067
I'M SORRY.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.333
I--I'M FREAKING OUT.
I'M AN INTERN AGAIN.

23:27.367 --> 23:29.267
YEAH, WE'RE ALL FREAKING OUT.
WE'RE ALL FREAKING OUT.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.633
I'M IN CHARGE OF A GROUP
OF INTERNS WHO THINK I'M CRAZY.

23:31.667 --> 23:33.733
AND I MIGHT ACTUALLY BE CRAZY,
BECAUSE DAY ONE

23:33.767 --> 23:35.167
OF ME BEING IN CHARGE,

23:35.200 --> 23:37.367
AND I'M OBSESSED
WITH RESCUING BAMBI.

23:37.400 --> 23:39.033
WE'RE ALL FREAKING OUT.

23:39.067 --> 23:40.800
SINCE WHEN DID YOU START
CALLING ME BAMBI?

23:40.833 --> 23:43.233
WHAT?
I'M NOT CALLING YOU BAMBI.
NO, I MEAN, I KNOW I-I--

23:43.267 --> 23:46.200
I UNDER--I EXPECT IT FROM
CRISTINA OR ALEX, BUT--

23:46.233 --> 23:48.600
I'M BAMBI.
I'M BAMBI, GEORGE, OKAY?

23:48.633 --> 23:51.600
IF ANYONE IN THIS SITUATION IS
A SAD LITTLE CARTOON CHARACTER,

23:51.633 --> 23:53.300
IT'S ME.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.233
I'M ALL ALONE
IN THE FOREST--

23:55.267 --> 23:57.167
ALL ALONE
IN THE FOREST, GEORGE--

23:57.200 --> 24:00.600
AND MY MOTHER'S BEEN SHOT
BY A HUNTER, AND WHERE ARE YOU?

24:00.633 --> 24:03.200
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.767
***

24:05.800 --> 24:07.667
I'M ON MY WAY TO SURGERY.

24:07.700 --> 24:11.600
***

24:11.633 --> 24:15.567
I REALLY AM UP FOR
A DRINK, YOU KNOW?

24:15.600 --> 24:17.367
IF YOU, UH, NEED TO TALK.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.300
WHAT WOULD I
NEED TO TALK ABOUT?

24:19.333 --> 24:21.267
MEREDITH.
YOU WERE LUCKY, MAN.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.133
THAT GIRL
JERKED YOU AROUND.

24:24.167 --> 24:27.033
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
HEY, I'M JUST...

24:27.067 --> 24:29.267
SEEMED LIKE YOU COULD USE
A FRIEND ABOUT NOW.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.567
MEREDITH'S MOTHER
NEVER WANTED HER...

24:31.600 --> 24:34.467
AND HER FATHER WAS NEVER
MAN ENOUGH TO HANG AROUND.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.033
SHE HAS A RIGHT TO BE DAMAGED,
AND US, TOGETHER,

24:37.067 --> 24:38.500
IT'S A BIG STEP FOR HER.

24:38.533 --> 24:40.433
HER BEST FRIEND GETS LEFT
ON THE ALTAR,

24:40.467 --> 24:43.333
AND ALL SHE SEES NOW IS THINGS
LIKE THIS, THEY DON'T WORK.

24:43.367 --> 24:46.167
SHE PANICS. SHE WANTS THIS.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO HAVE IT.

24:46.200 --> 24:48.100
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S NOT HER FAULT.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.033
SO DON'T EVER TALK TO ME
ABOUT MEREDITH GREY AGAIN,

24:50.067 --> 24:52.133
BECAUSE YOU DO NOT KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.167
AND I DON'T NEED A FRIEND.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.200
***

24:58.733 --> 25:00.400
OKAY, NANCY,

25:00.433 --> 25:02.567
I WANT YOU TO COUNT BACK
FROM A HUNDRED, OKAY?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.500
NO. NO. I'M NOT READY.

25:04.533 --> 25:07.167
IT'S JUST LIKE
GOING TO SLEEP.
I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS ALONE.

25:07.200 --> 25:10.133
I DON'T WANT
TO BE ALONE ANYMORE.
I KNOW.

25:10.167 --> 25:12.067
NO, I'M SCARED.
I KNOW.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
I AM SCARED, MEREDITH.
I KNOW.

25:14.133 --> 25:16.100
I KNOW.

25:16.133 --> 25:19.167
I THINK IT'S VERY BRAVE,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.667
IT'S MUCH BETTER TO BE ALONE
AND FEEL LIKE A SUCCESS

25:21.700 --> 25:23.600
THAN TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

25:23.633 --> 25:26.033
AND FEEL LIKE A FAILURE
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?

25:26.067 --> 25:28.233
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

25:28.267 --> 25:30.600
SO LET'S JUST TAKE CARE
OF YOUR ARM,

25:30.633 --> 25:33.300
AND THEN WE'LL DEAL WITH
THE REST LATER, OKAY?

25:39.600 --> 25:42.733
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
I'M BACK TO BABYSITTING.

25:44.633 --> 25:45.833
WHAT THE HELL?

25:45.867 --> 25:48.400
WHO TOOK MY CLAMPS
AND THE BANDAGE SCISSORS?

25:48.433 --> 25:50.033
(Joey choking)

25:50.067 --> 25:51.700
JOEY?

25:51.733 --> 25:54.300
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:54.333 --> 25:55.500
(Joey gags)

25:55.533 --> 25:58.433
THERE'S A FOREIGN BODY.
HIS ABDOMEN'S RIGID.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.367
SOMEBODY PAGE DR. BAILEY
RIGHT NOW. GO!

26:00.400 --> 26:03.100
COME ON, JOEY.
(gags)

26:07.133 --> 26:08.833
YOU LIKE HAMBURGERS,
DON'T YOU?

26:08.867 --> 26:10.233
YEAH.

26:10.267 --> 26:12.800
AND SPAGHETTI
WITH MEATBALLS,

26:12.833 --> 26:15.433
AND LASAGNA?
MM-HMM.

26:15.467 --> 26:16.800
THAT'S BEEF.

26:16.833 --> 26:19.200
THAT'S COW
YOU'RE EATING, SON.

26:19.233 --> 26:20.667
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:20.700 --> 26:22.600
COULD WE HAVE THE "CIRCLE
OF LIFE" LESSON LATER?

26:22.633 --> 26:25.367
I NEED TO GET IN HERE.
SORRY.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.300
(Izzie) YEAH.

26:27.333 --> 26:31.133
(panting)

26:31.167 --> 26:34.833
HER EYES ARE GLASSY.
YOU, GET IN HERE AND VENTILATE.

26:34.867 --> 26:36.767
THANKS.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.667
(panting continues)

26:38.700 --> 26:41.700
HER HEART RATE IS FADING.
WE'RE LOSING HER.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.600
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CHILDISH
AND RIDICULOUS.
NO, IT'S NOT.

26:44.633 --> 26:46.533
IT'S NOT CHILDISH
TO HOLD ON TO HOPE.

26:46.567 --> 26:48.333
IT'S ACTUALLY HARD--
VERY, VERY HARD.

26:48.367 --> 26:51.067
YOUR SON JUST WANTS TO BELIEVE
THAT SOME THINGS CAN WORK OUT

26:51.100 --> 26:53.067
FOR THE BEST.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.100
GET ME THE PADDLES.
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

26:55.133 --> 26:56.600
WHAT'S SHE DOING?

26:56.633 --> 26:59.600
INSURING WE NEVER SEE THE INSIDE
OF AN O.R. THIS YEAR?

26:59.633 --> 27:02.367
(monitor beeping erratically)

27:02.400 --> 27:05.700
SHE'S IN V-FIB. I'M GONNA SHOCK.
CHARGE TO 300 AND STAND BACK.

27:05.733 --> 27:07.300
(beeping continues)

27:07.333 --> 27:09.367
OKAY, CLEAR.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.800
(beeping continues)

27:12.833 --> 27:14.767
(paddles whir and beep)

27:14.800 --> 27:17.067
(interns gasp)

27:17.100 --> 27:21.033
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. SHE'S ALIVE?

27:21.067 --> 27:23.633
IT WORKED. SHE'S OKAY.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.500
(laughs) OH, MY GOD.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.533
GOT A BIG BLEEDER.

27:30.567 --> 27:33.533
DR. GREY,
PRESS AND HOLD RIGHT HERE.

27:33.567 --> 27:35.667
(George)
SHE'S HAVING CONTRACTIONS.
WELL, TAKE A LOOK, GEORGE.

27:35.700 --> 27:39.333
PROBABLY THE STRESS.
NO, THESE ARE STRONG,
AND THEY'RE TWO MINUTES APART.

27:39.367 --> 27:41.733
(Meredith) CALL O.B.
AND GET SOMEONE IN HERE.

27:41.767 --> 27:44.033
UH, I DON'T THINK
THERE'S TIME TO CALL O.B.

27:44.067 --> 27:46.133
HER WATER JUST BROKE,
AND SHE'S CROWNING.
CALL PEDS.
GET A WARMER IN HERE.

27:46.167 --> 27:47.733
THIS BABY'S COMING NOW.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.667
O'MALLEY, GET HER UP
IN STIRRUPS.
CAN WE PUT HER IN
A REVERSE TRENDELENBURG,

27:49.700 --> 27:51.567
HAVE ONE OF THE NURSES
PRESS ON HER ABDOMEN

27:51.600 --> 27:53.733
SINCE SHE CAN'T PUSH?
TRY IT WITHOUT ALL THE JOSTLING.

27:53.767 --> 27:56.500
I'M HOLDING ON
TO A MAJOR ARTERY HERE.

27:56.533 --> 27:58.567
OKAY, CLAMP.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.367
SCISSORS.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.133
(George) I GOT IT.

28:03.167 --> 28:04.333
I GOT HIM.

28:04.367 --> 28:07.367
(baby crying)

28:10.233 --> 28:11.700
(Meredith) GREAT JOB, GEORGE.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.800
THANKS.
(Mark) YEAH, YEAH,
WE'RE ALL HEROES.

28:13.833 --> 28:17.333
NOW IF NO ONE MINDS, I'D LIKE
TO GET THIS WOMAN'S ARM SEWN ON.

28:17.367 --> 28:20.333
(crying continues)

28:20.367 --> 28:24.267
(Mark) LIKE SHE SAID,
SHE'S GONNA NEED IT.

28:28.633 --> 28:31.200
I'M STARTING THE FUSION NOW.

28:31.233 --> 28:33.767
DID...

28:33.800 --> 28:35.633
HE JUST MOVE?

28:35.667 --> 28:38.533
(Cristina) OH, HE D--
HE DEFINITELY MOVED.

28:38.567 --> 28:40.533
THE ANESTHESIA'S LIGHT.
YANG, STABILIZE HIS NECK.

28:40.567 --> 28:42.733
(Cristina) OKAY, THREE,
COME AND GRAB HIS FEET.

28:42.767 --> 28:44.700
GO UNDER THE DRAPE AND DO NOT
CONTAMINATE THE STERILE FIELD.

28:44.733 --> 28:47.333
(Derek) WE NEED TO KEEP HIM
VERY STILL UNTIL HE IS UNDER.

28:47.367 --> 28:49.267
WE CAN'T RISK
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT.

28:49.300 --> 28:51.200
YOU CANNOT MOVE.
DO YOU HEAR ME?

28:51.233 --> 28:52.567
THIS IS NOT AN OPTION.

28:52.600 --> 28:54.500
EVERYTHING IS NOT GONNA BE FINE
IF YOU MOVE.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.800
IT WILL BE THE OPPOSITE
OF FINE.

28:56.833 --> 28:58.733
YOU CANNOT LEAVE
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

28:58.767 --> 29:00.400
THEY NEED YOU...

29:02.067 --> 29:05.567
NOT JUST THE MEMORY
THAT YOU LOVE THEM.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.167
ANYONE CARE TO EXPLAIN TO ME

29:15.200 --> 29:17.267
HOW MY PATIENT
WOUND UP IN THIS O.R.

29:17.300 --> 29:21.033
AND I WASN'T EVEN INFORMED?
KAREV?

29:21.067 --> 29:22.533
(Alex) LOOK--

29:22.567 --> 29:23.767
DR. KAREV DIDN'T PAGE YOU

29:23.800 --> 29:25.500
BECAUSE HE KNOWS
HOW TO PRIORITIZE.

29:25.533 --> 29:28.467
TEN MINUTES AGO,
THIS PATIENT WAS CODING

29:28.500 --> 29:30.633
FROM A PERFED ABDOMEN.

29:30.667 --> 29:34.133
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,
DR. KAREV'S QUICK THINKING

29:34.167 --> 29:37.133
IS THE REASON THAT YOUR PATIENT
IS EVEN STILL ALIVE.

29:37.167 --> 29:39.300
I'LL EXPECT
A FULLY DICTATED CHART

29:39.333 --> 29:41.267
BEFORE YOU LEAVE TONIGHT,
KAREV.

29:41.300 --> 29:43.433
AH, JACKPOT.

29:43.467 --> 29:46.333
DID HE SWALLOW THOSE?
HE REALLY WAS HUNGRY.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.667
POOR FOOL.
HE MUST SUFFER FROM PICA,

29:48.700 --> 29:51.533
AN UNCONTROLLABLE URGE TO EAT
ANY AND EVERYTHING.

29:51.567 --> 29:54.367
CHECK IT OUT--
A BUFFALO NICKEL.

29:54.400 --> 29:57.333
DR. BAILEY,
I SAW YOU WERE SCRUBBED IN.

29:57.367 --> 30:00.367
I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND SEE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.733
WHAT I'VE GOT?

30:02.767 --> 30:05.500
$2.37, SIR...

30:05.533 --> 30:06.800
IN CHANGE.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.367

30:09.400 --> 30:12.467

30:12.500 --> 30:14.200

30:14.233 --> 30:16.600

30:16.633 --> 30:19.500
***

30:19.533 --> 30:22.367
(baby crying)

30:22.400 --> 30:26.733
IT'S LIKE A CUTE FESTIVAL
IN HERE.

30:26.767 --> 30:30.067
I DELIVERED THAT ONE
AN HOUR AGO.

30:30.100 --> 30:32.200
OH, MY GOD. W--

30:32.233 --> 30:34.467
WHY AREN'T YOU, LIKE,
JUMPING UP AND DOWN?

30:34.500 --> 30:36.600
I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

30:36.633 --> 30:38.467
THIS IS DéJà VU.

30:38.500 --> 30:41.333
***

30:41.367 --> 30:43.300
UH...

30:43.333 --> 30:45.233
LOOK, GEORGE, YOU DIDN'T PASS
YOUR INTERN TEST.

30:45.267 --> 30:47.167
YOU KNOW, IT--IT HAPPENS.

30:47.200 --> 30:50.167
IT'S--IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.233
RIGHT?

30:51.267 --> 30:53.800
YEAH. YEAH.
IT'S NOBODY'S FAULT.

30:53.833 --> 30:57.667
YEAH, IT'S JUST THAT CALLIE
GAVE CRISTINA THE STUDY CARDS,

30:57.700 --> 30:59.567
AND MEREDITH DIDN'T WRITE
ANYTHING DOWN,

30:59.600 --> 31:01.467
AND CRISTINA
WAS PLANNING A WEDDING,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.400
AND IZZIE--
IZZIE JUST HAD TO...

31:03.433 --> 31:06.167
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M--
I'M RESPONSIBLE.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.100
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THE RESPONSIBLE ONE.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.767
I'M NOT SAYING,
"WHAT ABOUT ME?"

31:09.800 --> 31:11.700
I'M NOT SAYING,
"WHEN DO I GET WHAT I WANT?

31:11.733 --> 31:14.200
"WHEN DO I GET TO BE SOMEONE
OTHER THAN THE GUY

31:14.233 --> 31:16.833
WHO REPEATS HIS INTERN YEAR?"
I'M NOT SAYING THAT, BUT--

31:16.867 --> 31:19.033
BUT WHAT ABOUT YOU?
YEAH!

31:20.367 --> 31:22.733
I DIDN'T PLAN ON BEING HERE.

31:22.767 --> 31:25.600
I WAS ALL SET FOR AN INTERNSHIP
AT MASS GEN.

31:25.633 --> 31:28.133
AND THEN...
MY MOTHER GETS THE HICCUPS,

31:28.167 --> 31:30.267
AND I'M AT A FUNERAL.

31:30.300 --> 31:32.167
***

31:32.200 --> 31:34.633
YOU KNOW,
WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS.

31:34.667 --> 31:37.233
MOMS DIE,
AND DADS DRINK SO MUCH

31:37.267 --> 31:40.133
THAT THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YEAR THEY'RE IN,

31:40.167 --> 31:41.633
AND SISTERS--I--

31:41.667 --> 31:43.833
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THERE WAS A MEREDITH GREY

31:43.867 --> 31:45.767
UNTIL A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.667
AND SHE WON'T--SHE DOESN'T EVEN
WANT TO TALK TO ME.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.233
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

31:51.267 --> 31:52.467
YOU KNOW, I...

31:52.500 --> 31:55.533
I'D GIVING ANYTHING
TO NOT BE HERE.

31:55.567 --> 31:59.167
YOU KNOW, TO--TO HAVE MY LIFE
WORK OUT THE WAY I PLANNED,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.033
TO EVEN HAVE TIME TO ASK,
"WHAT ABOUT ME?"

32:02.067 --> 32:06.367
SO YOU--YOU CHANGE.
YOU--YOU GET OVER IT.

32:06.400 --> 32:07.567
***

32:07.600 --> 32:11.433
I'M HERE NOW, SO...

32:11.467 --> 32:13.100

32:20.233 --> 32:23.100
SO... STOP FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

I KNOW.

32:40.200 --> 32:43.433
***

32:57.100 --> 32:58.833
KAREV,
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE SURE

32:58.867 --> 33:00.767
PSYCH'S PREPARED TO CONSULT
ON THE PATIENT?

33:00.800 --> 33:02.133
THANK YOU.

33:02.167 --> 33:05.300
NOW WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU AND I ARE GONNA TALK.
CHIEF--

33:05.333 --> 33:07.233
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY
AND DISAPPOINTED.

33:07.267 --> 33:09.167
NO, I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M NOT DISAPPOINTED.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.700
I'M SPEECHLESS.

33:10.733 --> 33:12.767
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
BECAUSE I AM SPEECHLESS.

33:12.800 --> 33:16.500
IT MAKES ME SPEECHLESS TO
REALIZE YOU DIDN'T THINK THAT...

33:16.533 --> 33:19.200
I WOULD'VE MADE AN--
AN EXCELLENT CHIEF RESIDENT.

33:19.233 --> 33:20.433
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:20.467 --> 33:22.667
YOU WOULD'VE MADE
AN EXCELLENT CHIEF RESIDENT.

33:22.700 --> 33:27.267
BUT YOU'LL MAKE
AN EVEN MORE EXCELLENT SURGEON.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.167
YOU BELONG IN THE O.R.,
BAILEY.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.200
FOCUS ON HONING THOSE SKILLS,

33:33.233 --> 33:35.500
NOT ON HOW WELL
YOU CAN JUGGLE SCHEDULES

33:35.533 --> 33:37.633
OR FILL OUT PAPERWORK.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.833
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

33:38.867 --> 33:42.733
YOU'LL THANK ME FOR THIS
ONE DAY.

33:42.767 --> 33:44.767
BUT NOT TODAY.

33:56.633 --> 33:59.100
I'M THE ONE
THAT COULD USE A FRIEND.

33:59.133 --> 34:00.300
(sighs)

34:00.333 --> 34:03.367
I SAID THAT YOU COULD USE
A FRIEND. I COULD USE A FRIEND.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.733
LOOK, MARK--
NO, I DIDN'T COME TO SEATTLE
FOR ADDISON.

34:05.767 --> 34:07.667
I DIDN'T COME TO SEATTLE
TO BE CHIEF.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.567
I CAME TO SEATTLE FOR YOU,
OKAY?

34:09.600 --> 34:12.233
I CAME TO SEATTLE
TO GET YOU BACK.

34:18.233 --> 34:19.400
I KNOW.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.433
I WANT TO TAKE IT BACK NOW,
BUT I ALREADY SAID IT, SO...

34:22.467 --> 34:24.133
(laughs)

34:24.167 --> 34:26.300
YEAH. (laughs)
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE A DRINK.

34:26.333 --> 34:27.800
WE COULD.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.100
YEAH. NOT TODAY.

34:30.133 --> 34:33.133
***

34:38.367 --> 34:39.233

34:39.267 --> 34:41.300
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T
WAKE UP THIS MORNING

34:41.333 --> 34:43.633
EXPECTING THIS WAS HOW
YOUR FIRST DAY WAS GONNA GO.

34:43.667 --> 34:45.567
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D GET
TO REATTACH AN ARM

34:45.600 --> 34:47.667
OR OBSERVE BRAIN SURGERY.

34:47.700 --> 34:50.367
INSTEAD YOU HELPED SAVE
THE LIFE OF A DEER.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.300

'CAUSE LIKE IT OR NOT,
YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME.

34:56.200 --> 34:58.100
AND I'M THE KIND OF DOCTOR

34:58.133 --> 35:00.033
WHO LETS
A LITTLE KID CONVINCE HER

35:00.067 --> 35:02.133
SHE CAN DO THE IMPOSSIBLE.

35:02.167 --> 35:04.067
OH, PLUS,
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

35:04.100 --> 35:06.167
I THOUGHT TODAY WAS GONNA GO
A LOT DIFFERENTLY, TOO.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.700
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA GET
THE GOOD INTERNS.

35:08.733 --> 35:10.633
INSTEAD I GET STUCK
WITH THE DUDS.

35:10.667 --> 35:14.233
SO I HAVE TO ADJUST
MY EXPECTATIONS AS WELL.

WE'RE BREAKING UP.

39:06.133 --> 39:08.233
WE'RE BREAKING UP.

39:08.267 --> 39:10.733
IT HURTS TO GROW.

39:10.767 --> 39:13.833

39:42.667 --> 39:44.567
SO A BREAKUP KISS.

39:44.600 --> 39:47.167
A BREAKUP KISS.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.667
AND SOME BREAKUP SEX.

39:49.700 --> 39:52.300

39:52.333 --> 39:53.733
BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH...

39:53.767 --> 39:56.400

THE MORE THINGS CHANGE,

39:56.433 --> 39:59.100
THE MORE THEY STAY THE SAME.

39:59.133 --> 40:01.533
(doorbell rings)

40:11.300 --> 40:12.600
AND SOMETIMES--

40:12.633 --> 40:16.667
OH, SOMETIMES CHANGE IS GOOD.

40:18.567 --> 40:21.267
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

40:21.300 --> 40:26.200
SOMETIMES CHANGE IS...

40:28.367 --> 40:30.600
EVERYTHING.

40:30.633 --> 40:33.633
