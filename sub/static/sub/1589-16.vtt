WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:03.260
Previously on Pretty Little
Liars...

00:03.300 --> 00:05.461
If Holbrook's helping Alison,
then she probably convinced him

00:05.500 --> 00:06.467
that she's the victim.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.060
Alison, please!

00:09.110 --> 00:11.465
I want you to meet somebody.
Talia Sandoval, Emily Fields.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.478
Your mom told my mom that
I could rent your guesthouse.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.375
I'm Jonny.
Raymond.

00:15.410 --> 00:17.503
I can't vouch for
the egg salad,

00:17.550 --> 00:20.018
but the peanut butter cookie,
four stars.

00:24.620 --> 00:27.157
Listen to this!
Don't you understand
you're making it worse?

00:27.190 --> 00:28.282
There are things
that I can't know about--

00:28.320 --> 00:29.082
Surprise, surprise.

00:29.130 --> 00:31.189
Who do you think it was?
Holbrook?

00:31.230 --> 00:33.118
I can write a better letter.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.754
Talmadge recently
hired Jackie Molina as
an admISSIOnS officer.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.360
As in your ex Jackie,
who hates my guts?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.799
Jackie wrote it.
It worked.

00:39.840 --> 00:41.137
What are you gonna
tell us Ezra?

00:43.140 --> 00:44.459
CALEB: Toby was on a search
at Mona's property,

00:44.510 --> 00:46.432
and found a bloody knife.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.107
Where's the knife?
Is it in there?

00:48.140 --> 00:49.698
( panting )

00:51.310 --> 00:54.814
Wait. 50 the knife you and Caleb
found was covered in blood?

00:54.850 --> 00:56.340
What, Mona's blood?

00:56.390 --> 00:58.210
Yeah, and any of our prints
could have been on it.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.559
Thank God you got
rid of it.

01:00.590 --> 01:02.683
Do we think
Holbrook planted it?

01:02.730 --> 01:06.291
Well, you vouched for him.
You still think
he's a good guy?

01:06.330 --> 01:08.298
I'm not so sure anymore.

01:11.170 --> 01:13.638
And that whole family
emergency thing is a lie.

01:13.670 --> 01:16.537
I mean, Holbrook
could still be around.
He could have planted it.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.333
You should have called us
last night, Hanna.

01:18.370 --> 01:19.439
As soon as you got home.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.607
Well, it was late.
Wait a second.

01:21.640 --> 01:24.245
So if Alison's "A"
and Holbrook's on her side,

01:24.280 --> 01:26.612
they could pin Mona's
murder on us, couldn't they?

01:30.190 --> 01:32.556
I don't know.
I have to get home.

01:32.590 --> 01:36.219
Em, do you want me to drop
that off in the mail on my way?

01:36.260 --> 01:38.649
I'm good. I'll go later.

01:38.690 --> 01:40.123
If it's something you're
having trouble letting go of,

01:40.160 --> 01:41.593
we can do it for you.

01:41.630 --> 01:43.427
This is not holding on.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.768
This is strictly
here's your stuff.
I promise.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.495
I found, like, three pairs
of her swim goggles,

01:47.540 --> 01:49.565
and some of her CDs
In my car.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.738
Are you still going
for spring break?

01:52.780 --> 01:54.907
I thought that
Paige asked for some space.

01:54.940 --> 01:56.646
She did, so I'm not.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.469
My shift's about to start.

02:01.520 --> 02:04.239
I'm out, too.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.518
Cute shirt, by the way.

02:05.550 --> 02:07.609
Have I borrowed that?

02:07.660 --> 02:09.355
Probably not.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.823
Well, maybe I should.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.865
Can I get a refill?
I didn't sleep last night.

02:17.900 --> 02:20.164
Aria, I was here all night.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.633
Holbrook didn't come
to the party.

02:21.670 --> 02:23.558
There's no way he could have
left you that bookmark.

02:23.610 --> 02:26.477
All right, well, somebody did.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.637
And I've really got to find
another college to apply to

02:28.680 --> 02:30.705
before Ezra finds out
how I got into Talmadge.

02:30.750 --> 02:31.739
How much?

02:31.780 --> 02:33.645
Just take it.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.342
No, I've already lied to Ezra.
I don't want to steal, too.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.846
_ Even if it is
Just a cup of coffee.

02:37.890 --> 02:40.256
Okay, then.
Fifty cents.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.382
Since when?

02:41.420 --> 02:43.229
New brew, new prices.

02:44.360 --> 02:45.827
Here.

02:45.860 --> 02:48.420
( beeping )

03:04.650 --> 03:05.947
What?

03:05.980 --> 03:07.948
Aria, this is the letter
you wrote to Jackie.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.208
Make it stop.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.512
I'm trying.

03:13.990 --> 03:15.457
What does it say?

03:18.630 --> 03:22.691
"This kind of lie will stay
on your permanent record. A."

03:30.010 --> 03:31.363
* Got a secret

03:31.410 --> 03:32.775
* Can you keep it?

03:32.810 --> 03:35.005
* Swear this one
you'll save *

03:35.040 --> 03:37.543
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

03:37.580 --> 03:40.310
* Taking this one
to the grave *

03:40.350 --> 03:42.011
* If I show you
then I know *

03:42.050 --> 03:45.281
* You won't tell
what I said *

03:45.320 --> 03:47.584
* 'Cause two can keep
a secret *

03:47.620 --> 03:49.929
* If one of them is dead

03:53.560 --> 03:54.754
ASHLEY: Hanna?
Is that you?

03:54.800 --> 03:56.495
Yeah.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.600
You're home.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.377
Hi.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.341
Oh, hey, Ted.
How was Peru?

04:12.380 --> 04:14.018
Good.

04:14.050 --> 04:15.517
Put a new roof
on a chapel,

04:15.550 --> 04:18.439
built a playground
for our sponsor school,

04:18.490 --> 04:20.481
dreamed about
your mother's waffles.

04:22.460 --> 04:24.485
You know
they eat guinea pigs?

04:24.530 --> 04:25.849
Hmm. Waclq.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.699
You didn't hear me
come home last night?

04:27.730 --> 04:29.766
Didn't hear me call either.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.337
Tried to warn you
I was coming back early.

04:32.370 --> 04:35.294
I had a long week at work.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.534
Must have slept
like a rock last night.

04:37.610 --> 04:38.599
Waffles are done.

04:38.640 --> 04:39.971
Looks like it's a nice day out.

04:40.010 --> 04:41.807
Do you want to eat
on the patio?

04:41.840 --> 04:43.808
Yeah, sure.

04:51.090 --> 04:51.988
So why did
you come back early?

04:52.020 --> 04:54.011
I thought the college
had events planned

04:54.060 --> 04:55.379
for Saturday and Sunday.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.388
I had a migraine.

04:57.430 --> 04:58.920
Why were you gone
when I woke up this morning?

04:58.960 --> 05:00.848
Ted wanted to come over
for breakfast.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.891
I was getting syrup.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.625
So you weren't avoiding me?

05:04.670 --> 05:07.036
No, I was under the impression
you would be gone all weekend.

05:07.070 --> 05:09.504
You left
because of a headache?

05:09.540 --> 05:11.633
Wait, are you mad
that I bailed

05:11.670 --> 05:14.400
or that I walked in
on your Wild college weekend?

05:14.440 --> 05:15.998
Look, whatever you think
you saw--

05:16.040 --> 05:17.803
Mom,
I know what I saw.

05:17.850 --> 05:20.512
And I just
don't understand why.

05:20.550 --> 05:21.574
Could we just talk about it?

05:25.690 --> 05:27.510
Hanna, take this orange juice
outside, please.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.549
Mom.

05:28.590 --> 05:30.455
Orange juice, Hanna.
Please.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.868
Careful.
Cup's hot.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.764
Nice foam, but if you start
at the top

05:45.810 --> 05:46.834
and work your way down
at the bottom.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.405
I'm pretty sure
I can figure it out.

05:49.450 --> 05:50.678
Thanks, though.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.575
I'm in your territory.

05:52.620 --> 05:54.611
I'll just give you your space.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.087
Is everything okay
with you two?

05:59.120 --> 06:00.781
Yeah.

06:00.820 --> 06:04.085
Just...
defining job duties.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.121
Do you want me
to say anything?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.923
No. It's okay,
we'll work it out.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.569
( cell phone ringing )

06:10.600 --> 06:11.567
Hey.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.591
Hey.
Can we--

06:13.640 --> 06:14.891
I'm so sorry,
this is the contractor.

06:14.940 --> 06:15.964
I've been trying to get
a hold of him all day.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.536
I'll be right back.

06:18.810 --> 06:19.902
Hey.

06:26.450 --> 06:28.748
It's because you disappeared
for three days on another job.

06:28.780 --> 06:29.747
And I'll tell you what.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.745
When you get back to me,

06:30.790 --> 06:32.041
it better be
with a refund check.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.782
I'm sorry.

06:34.820 --> 06:36.424
You know the shelves
that I put in with Mike?

06:36.460 --> 06:38.428
This guy is trying to charge me
for the installation.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.190
Sorry, can I do
something to help?

06:41.230 --> 06:42.868
No, no, it's all right.

06:44.570 --> 06:48.028
Um. Look, Ezra--

06:48.070 --> 06:50.209
Oh, did you have fun
last night?

06:50.240 --> 06:51.798
I think Bob Milsom
really liked you.

06:51.840 --> 06:53.068
And I know that he could
speak on your behalf

06:53.110 --> 06:54.998
to the admission staff
at Vassar.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.803
It's one phone call.

06:58.480 --> 07:01.074
Yeah, yeah,
that would be great--

07:01.120 --> 07:02.439
( cell phone ringing )

07:02.490 --> 07:03.889
I'm so sorry.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.842
This joker.
I have to take this.

07:07.020 --> 07:08.510
Hello?

07:08.560 --> 07:09.879
Oh, you can't find
the copy of the invoice.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.454
Why don't I send
you mine?

07:16.100 --> 07:18.660
Aren't you gonna
open them?

07:18.700 --> 07:21.692
I don't need to open them.
I already know what they say.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.702
Three acceptance letters.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.949
You don't seem excited.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.175
Come on,
the University of Hawaii.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.580
Listen, I know
I shouldn't have stormed
off like that last night--

07:39.620 --> 07:41.212
This is not about you
storming off, okay?

07:41.260 --> 07:43.228
This is about me needing
to put zinc on my nose

07:43.260 --> 07:44.921
for the next four years,

07:44.960 --> 07:46.621
and people wearing
flip-flops to class.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.799
A lot of people would love
to go to school in Hawaii.

07:48.830 --> 07:51.822
Well, I love brick and ivy
and wool pea coats.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.633
I don't even want to go
to these schools.

07:53.670 --> 07:54.898
I just applied to them

07:54.940 --> 07:56.635
because they're far away
from here.

07:56.670 --> 08:00.071
But you applied to schools
you don't want to go to?

08:00.110 --> 08:01.805
Just to get far away
from Rosewood?

08:01.840 --> 08:03.603
After what happened
with Mona,

08:03.650 --> 08:04.969
we all decided
that it would be smart

08:05.010 --> 08:07.717
to get as far away
from Alison as possible.

08:10.620 --> 08:15.785
God, how is she still deciding
where I go and what I do?

08:15.820 --> 08:19.256
She's behind bars,
and I still cannot get
far enough away from her.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.292
New Mexico?
Montana?

08:21.330 --> 08:23.662
Let's say that I do go
to the University of Hawaii.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.191
She'll be here.
In jail.
Right.

08:26.230 --> 08:27.868
And she was able to plant
a murder weapon

08:27.900 --> 08:29.561
in Mona's baclqard
for you to find.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.861
You didn't think
she can book a plane ticket?

08:30.910 --> 08:32.059
We don't know--

08:32.110 --> 08:33.304
Look, you don't know, okay?

08:33.340 --> 08:35.535
We are pretty sure
that she has help.

08:35.580 --> 08:38.276
Well, none of us will ever know
that for sure, will we?

08:38.310 --> 08:39.971
( knocking on door)

08:45.220 --> 08:46.812
Hey, Jonny. Hi.

08:46.860 --> 08:47.884
I'm a little early.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.558
That's fine. Keys?

08:49.590 --> 08:52.229
And here's deposit,
first and last.

08:52.260 --> 08:56.094
A lot of it, not all of it,
it's mostly fives and ones.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.558
I'll make sure _
that my mom gets this.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.160
Toby, this is Jonny,
this is Toby.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.065
Jonny's gonna be living
in the barn.

09:04.110 --> 09:04.906
Welcome to the neighborhood.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.302
I should probably
get going to work.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.604
Yeah. Bye.

09:10.650 --> 09:12.538
Thanks.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.983
So.
Your boyfriend's a cop?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.184
Yeah, he wasn't always.

09:28.130 --> 09:30.621
( cell phone beeps )

09:34.700 --> 09:37.032
Em, come here.

09:37.070 --> 09:38.230
I just got a message.

09:43.350 --> 09:46.171
"Stop looking for me.
I'm tired of hiding.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.247
Grill at noon. H."
As in Holbrook?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.813
You are not meeting him
by yourself.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.818
Why? It's in the middle of town
in the middle of the day.

09:55.860 --> 09:57.157
And I don't think
this is an "A" trap.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.226
I can handle this alone.

10:00.860 --> 10:02.828
_The least I can do
IS just hear hIm out.

10:02.870 --> 10:05.293
If Holbrook's tired
of dishing out Alison's revenge,

10:05.330 --> 10:07.161
I might not have to tell Ezra
about that letter.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.177
Here we go.

10:14.210 --> 10:15.177
Hammer.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.247
Let me know
if you need anything else.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.269
Cool.

10:18.310 --> 10:19.846
Where's your garbage?

10:19.880 --> 10:21.279
Right there.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.955
Are you transferring?

10:28.990 --> 10:31.129
'Cause Hollis is kind of
on the opposite side of town.

10:31.160 --> 10:33.651
That's good to know,
but I'm not.

10:33.700 --> 10:34.997
I mean, I might.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.123
I haven't decided yet.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.296
I've been traveling,
mostly.

10:41.470 --> 10:43.233
I can make you a sandwich.

10:43.270 --> 10:44.259
That'd be great.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.402
No ham, though.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.169
Ham's got
a sketchy texture.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.314
I'm not grocery shopping.
These are art supplies.

10:54.350 --> 10:58.047
For color.
Coffee grounds.
Score.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.216
Do you make your own paint?

10:59.250 --> 11:01.252
When I need to.

11:01.290 --> 11:04.828
Especially after a deposit
first and last months' rent.

11:04.860 --> 11:05.827
Were you in Italy?

11:05.860 --> 11:07.999
About a month.
How did you...

11:08.030 --> 11:09.725
We studied the Renaissance,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.726
and I did a project
on Botticelli.

11:11.770 --> 11:14.091
So I made my own tempera paints
from scratch.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.334
I'd love to hear
about your trip.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.167
I've always wanted
to go to Italy.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.336
I'll make you a deal.

11:18.370 --> 11:21.828
I'll give you a travelogue
if you let me borrow an egg.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.370
Yeah, deal.

11:27.050 --> 11:30.019
( cell phone beeps )

11:31.420 --> 11:32.751
I'm so sorry.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.917
I'm gonna need to--
to go.

11:34.960 --> 11:35.984
I'll get you
the egg later.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.079
Sure.
I'll see ya.

11:55.380 --> 11:56.938
Yeah,
Aria got the same text.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.777
We're at Caleb's,
we're trying to figure it out.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.982
Okay, Em, I'll call you
when we're done.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.341
All right, so obviously ghosts
don't have fingers.

12:05.390 --> 12:07.085
So how was Mona
sending us texts?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.849
Not a ghost.
An alert.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.358
Sent automatically
by a security company.

12:11.390 --> 12:13.995
Mona put some kind of LoJack
on her laptop before she died.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.498
Someone must have gotten
through the encryption,
set off an alarm.

12:16.530 --> 12:18.464
Yeah, there were
a bunch of numbers.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.036
GPS coordinates.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.130
Probably the location
where the laptop was used.

12:23.170 --> 12:26.333
Looks like it's a storage place
off of the turnpike.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.974
It's still there.

12:28.010 --> 12:30.308
I logged in to
the security company's website.

12:30.350 --> 12:31.908
So that blinky thing,

12:31.950 --> 12:33.941
that's where Ali hid
Mona's laptop?

12:33.980 --> 12:36.847
Could Mona have set this up
to alert the police?

12:36.890 --> 12:40.087
It's an option,
but she didn't.

12:40.120 --> 12:42.554
She sent it
to the four of you.

12:42.590 --> 12:45.980
And usually, Mona's
security is incredibly tight,

12:46.030 --> 12:47.918
but it's almost like
she purposely

12:47.960 --> 12:49.894
made it easy for me
to log in.

12:49.930 --> 12:52.296
So we could get her laptop back
if Ali took it?

12:52.330 --> 12:54.491
Or so we could track down
whoever took the laptop

12:54.540 --> 12:56.064
without them knowing
that we were coming.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.830
Do you guys think this is
where Holbrook is hiding?

12:58.870 --> 13:00.838
Well, Aria's gonna text us
when she's at the Grill.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.906
If Holbrook's with her,
then that gives us time
to go and look around.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.247
( cell phone ringing )

13:05.280 --> 13:07.214
That was fast.
Who's driving?

13:07.250 --> 13:09.377
Hold your horses,
it's for me.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.910
Hey, Ted.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.558
Yeah, yeah,
I'll meet you there.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.148
Pastor back?

13:17.190 --> 13:19.249
Yeah, this morning.
I have to go meet him.

13:19.290 --> 13:21.827
( cell phone beeps )
That's Aria.

13:21.860 --> 13:22.861
Do you want us
to drop you off?

13:22.900 --> 13:24.788
No. I'll go by myself.

13:26.030 --> 13:27.031
Everything okay?

13:27.070 --> 13:28.298
Yeah.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.433
Oh, and if you see
anything suspicious,

13:30.470 --> 13:31.562
don't pick it up.

13:31.610 --> 13:33.498
Please don't let him
pick anything up.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.872
And what's that thing they say
about rats in the corner?

13:35.910 --> 13:38.049
A cornered rat will bite?
Yes.

13:38.080 --> 13:39.502
Remember, Holbrook's a rat.

13:44.020 --> 13:45.214
( door closes )

13:50.560 --> 13:52.448
Aria.

13:52.490 --> 13:53.991
Jason.

13:54.030 --> 13:55.099
Hey.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.119
Hey.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.197
Are you meeting someone?

13:59.230 --> 14:01.869
Yeah.

14:01.900 --> 14:05.404
Yeah, I am, but I don't think
they're gonna show up.

14:09.280 --> 14:11.305
How are you?
Since--

14:11.350 --> 14:14.569
Since I basically
put my sister in prison?

14:16.220 --> 14:20.179
Well, we can start at tense
and work our way on from there.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.479
How is she?

14:23.530 --> 14:26.055
She's tried to call us
a few times, but--

14:26.090 --> 14:27.455
You don't have to explain.

14:27.500 --> 14:31.493
I went to see her once.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.168
That was enough.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.531
( cell phone beeps )

14:39.670 --> 14:41.604
Do you want to grab a bite?

14:41.640 --> 14:43.244
I was supposed
to meet Ashley,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.373
Hanna's mom,
for a working lunch,

14:45.410 --> 14:48.277
but she just canceled.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.982
It might actually might be nice
to talk about Alison.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.659
Yeah.
Yeah, it might.

15:04.570 --> 15:07.266
Oh, there's stuff
in the kitchen,
if you want to clean.

15:07.300 --> 15:09.495
I can show you.
I know.
In the supply closet.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.405
I'm just gonna go
and put this with the rest.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.601
Oh, that's not usually
where we keep that stuff.

15:13.640 --> 15:16.438
Listen, I just had
some down-time,

15:16.480 --> 15:18.345
and I don't do well
with idle hands.

15:18.380 --> 15:21.247
If there's some things you think
we should change, then great.

15:21.280 --> 15:24.386
Just bring it up before you
decide on your own. Deal?

15:24.420 --> 15:25.648
Deal.

15:25.690 --> 15:27.555
I actually
did want to ask,

15:27.590 --> 15:30.081
do you think Ezra would go
for a new uniform?

15:30.130 --> 15:31.085
Uniform?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.552
Yeah, nothing fancy.

15:32.590 --> 15:35.525
Just a polo with the logo.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.460
You know, something casual,
and cohesive.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.937
Just a little... neater.

15:43.740 --> 15:45.537
Neater than what?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.333
Well, I was
just noticing earlier

15:47.380 --> 15:50.304
that there's a little hole
in the shoulder of your shirt.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.410
And so I started
thinking that maybe--

15:53.450 --> 15:55.577
It's a T-shirt.
It's comfortable.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.544
Yeah, just maybe something
a little darker,

15:58.590 --> 16:00.057
so that the stains
don't show.

16:00.090 --> 16:02.479
Okay, maybe one new idea
at a time.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.582
Yeah.
Yeah? Okay.

16:05.630 --> 16:07.222
Yeah.

16:09.330 --> 16:12.390
( GPS beeps )

16:15.500 --> 16:17.468
I've got some bolt cutters
in my car.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.330
I like to be prepared.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.302
They won't work on that.
It's a shrouded lock.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.346
Hard to cut,
even harder to pick.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.075
Spencer?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.509
Mrs. Horowitz.
Hey.

16:31.550 --> 16:32.642
You look familiar.

16:32.690 --> 16:35.079
Did you transfer out of
my third period last semester?

16:35.120 --> 16:37.224
No, I wasn't in your class.

16:37.260 --> 16:38.579
Probably just saw me
in the halls.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.320
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

16:44.130 --> 16:46.121
My friend just got
an apartment.

16:46.170 --> 16:48.365
And so we're just getting
some things

16:48.400 --> 16:50.402
out of storage for him.

16:50.440 --> 16:52.305
Are you here often?

16:52.340 --> 16:54.035
Every month or so.
Why?

16:54.080 --> 16:57.345
Well, I guess this really
isn't the kind of place

16:57.380 --> 16:58.642
where you get to know
your neighbors.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.240
You're talking about 1017,
aren't you?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.111
That smell, am I right?

17:03.150 --> 17:04.378
Smell?

17:04.420 --> 17:06.047
Oh, yeah, there's
some sort of an odor.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.785
It wafts down
the hallway sometimes.

17:07.820 --> 17:09.219
_ _ I think _
It's comIng from that unIt.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.251
Have you ever spoken
to the renter?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.451
About a month or so,
there was a girl, blonde.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.058
Hey, if it starts
to smell again,

17:15.100 --> 17:16.658
you think you could say
something to the manager?

17:16.700 --> 17:18.065
Sure, yeah.

17:18.100 --> 17:19.499
What does the blonde girl
look like?

17:19.530 --> 17:20.792
Just in case I spot her.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.728
I tried to stop her,
but she was in a hurry.

17:22.770 --> 17:25.068
I didn't get
to see her face.

17:25.110 --> 17:26.668
Not that management
would care anyway.

17:26.710 --> 17:27.699
They ought to do
something about it.

17:27.740 --> 17:29.207
It's really unsanitary.

17:29.240 --> 17:30.639
Yeah, absolutely.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.586
Hey.

17:37.620 --> 17:39.247
Bye, Mrs. Horowitz.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.258
See you in school.

17:42.460 --> 17:43.529
Is she coming back?

17:43.560 --> 17:45.152
No, I don't think so.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.623
Where did you go?

17:46.660 --> 17:49.322
I made a shim out of
your teacher's soda can.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.123
We're gonna use it
to pick the lock.

17:51.170 --> 17:52.865
I thought you said that
you can't pick that lock.

17:52.900 --> 17:55.835
Not that lock.
Her lock.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.314
Forget about the alibi.
Does your dad
really believe her?

18:11.350 --> 18:13.352
Doesn't matter.

18:13.390 --> 18:15.255
I mean, he only knows
how to protect her.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.689
He'll do the same thing
on the witness stand,

18:16.720 --> 18:19.723
even if he knows
what she's capable of.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.694
What do you think
she's capable of?

18:21.730 --> 18:23.823
A lot.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.326
I've seen her do things.

18:25.370 --> 18:27.190
I've seen her_
talk people Into thIngs.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.867
I mean, the way you girls
used to follow her around--

18:28.900 --> 18:30.663
Used to.

18:32.310 --> 18:33.732
I know you're not
on the best of terms,

18:33.780 --> 18:37.602
but the police
have a theory.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.140
They think she had help.

18:39.180 --> 18:40.408
With Mona?

18:40.450 --> 18:41.519
After.

18:43.520 --> 18:45.545
Putting Mona's body
in the trunk of her car,

18:45.590 --> 18:47.854
hiding it or dumping it.

18:47.890 --> 18:51.724
Yeah, we kind of think
the same thing.

18:51.760 --> 18:54.456
Do you remember
when she passed that
lie detector test?

18:56.930 --> 18:59.626
Someone on the inside,

18:59.670 --> 19:02.161
who could change the results,
make sure she passed.

19:02.200 --> 19:04.509
Is there anything
you noticed between

19:04.540 --> 19:05.837
Alison and Holbrook?

19:07.610 --> 19:09.532
I've only dealt with him
a few times.

19:09.580 --> 19:10.945
Not that
I would have noticed.

19:10.980 --> 19:12.470
She can get away with things
right under your nose.

19:12.510 --> 19:15.673
Yeah, well, we think
that they might be close.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.881
That she talked him
into doing things.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.387
( phone buzzes )

19:19.420 --> 19:21.285
God, what is it with cops
in this town?

19:26.430 --> 19:28.352
So you think
that is possible?

19:28.400 --> 19:31.198
I can't say for sure.
But Ali's probably
cut him loose by now.

19:31.230 --> 19:32.822
What else
can he do for her?

19:39.870 --> 19:42.407
Babe, you sound really echo-y.
Like you're in an air duct.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.499
That's because
I'm in an air duct.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.279
Ted's waiting for me.

19:46.310 --> 19:47.641
Just call me
if you find anything.

19:47.680 --> 19:48.647
Okay.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.446
Hey.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.682
Let's sit down.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.698
So, um...

20:04.730 --> 20:09.190
I want to talk to you
about your mother.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.965
I'm pretty sure
that you should

20:13.010 --> 20:16.434
probably talk
to her about this.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.903
She knows that I know.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.811
Because I know.

20:23.850 --> 20:27.752
But I haven't
asked you yet.

20:27.790 --> 20:28.779
Oh.

20:28.820 --> 20:31.357
Wait, asked me what?

20:31.390 --> 20:34.427
For your permission.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.825
Hanna,

20:38.630 --> 20:40.461
I'd like to
marry your mother.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.606
Oh.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.029
Well, I still think that
you should

20:46.070 --> 20:47.879
probably talk to her
about this.

20:47.910 --> 20:54.372
I really would like for you, me,
and your mom to be a family.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.412
And if we're going
to be a family,

20:57.450 --> 21:00.510
I want to make sure
you're all In.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.017
VVhen?

21:03.060 --> 21:05.051
Tonight.

21:05.090 --> 21:09.026
Over dinner at the house,
and I want you to be there.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.664
Tonight?

21:12.570 --> 21:15.459
Yeah, definitely,
I'm totally in.

21:16.670 --> 21:18.831
Is it gonna be like
a fancy dinner or?

21:18.870 --> 21:21.407
Super-casual.
Like any other night.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.771
I want her to be surprised.

21:22.810 --> 21:24.539
Don't worry.
My lips are sealed.

21:24.580 --> 21:25.808
Thanks.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.656
Hey, Mom.

21:36.690 --> 21:37.759
Call me back
when you get this.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.280
I really need to talk to you.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.797
It's a flower shop.

21:45.830 --> 21:46.865
What's a flower shop?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.538
Where I'm meeting Holbrook.

21:48.570 --> 21:50.606
He must've seen me talking to
Jason and gotten spooked.

21:50.640 --> 21:51.607
He wants to meet me alone.

21:51.640 --> 21:52.937
If he's really crossing Ali,

21:52.970 --> 21:55.006
I guess he wouldn't want it
getting back to her.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.508
Just... check in, okay?

21:57.550 --> 21:58.778
Yeah, I will.

22:15.030 --> 22:18.818
Your T-shirt,
was it a gift?

22:18.870 --> 22:20.121
What?

22:20.170 --> 22:23.435
From the ex?

22:23.470 --> 22:24.562
You got defensive

22:24.610 --> 22:27.101
when I pointed out
the hole in your shirt.

22:27.140 --> 22:29.438
It's not a big deal.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.869
It is,
and I'm sorry.

22:31.910 --> 22:33.411
You know, when someone's
important to you,

22:33.450 --> 22:34.519
it can be hard to let go.

22:39.120 --> 22:42.954
There's this dish
and it's a beef stew.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.548
It's called ropa vieja.

22:44.590 --> 22:46.683
It literally means
"old clothes."

22:46.730 --> 22:49.392
It's just one of those
old recipes that

22:49.430 --> 22:51.125
comes from a hundred
dIfferent places,

22:51.170 --> 22:52.922
and everybody makes it
the same way,

22:52.970 --> 22:54.460
over and over.

22:54.500 --> 22:58.061
You know, every once
in a while, you got to add

22:58.110 --> 23:00.601
some yellow peppers,
green olives,

23:00.640 --> 23:03.677
you know, flavor, color.

23:03.710 --> 23:07.510
And then the same old thing
can feel brand-new.

23:08.980 --> 23:11.540
I don't know if I'm ready
to feel brand-new.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.889
Well, how can you
when you're carrying

23:14.920 --> 23:17.525
your old relationship
around on your back?

23:38.210 --> 23:39.507
Thanks.
You got it?

23:39.550 --> 23:40.574
Yeah.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.904
That's Mona's computer.

24:08.940 --> 24:10.669
No, don't touch anything.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.816
It's really neat in here,
it's too neat.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.815
Everything's bagged.

24:16.850 --> 24:19.910
It's clear plastic.
It looks like evidence.

24:19.950 --> 24:22.453
Holbrook?

24:25.990 --> 24:30.620
There's so much blood
on these clothes.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.230
Do you think this is what Mona
was wearing when she died?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.962
Why's he keeping them?

24:37.000 --> 24:40.231
Maybe the more
important question is,

24:40.270 --> 24:44.104
is this where he kept the knife
until he planted it?

24:44.150 --> 24:47.176
He's keeping it
to build a case...

24:47.210 --> 24:48.746
against one of us.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.481
Get down.

25:02.630 --> 25:04.598
There's someone else
In here,

25:04.630 --> 25:06.689
behind the shelves.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.838
Wait. Wait here.

25:22.120 --> 25:23.075
Don't.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.179
It's just an empty suit.

25:30.930 --> 25:32.181
And a barrel.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.290
Em...

25:38.330 --> 25:40.696
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

25:43.270 --> 25:45.704
That she's in there?

25:54.820 --> 25:59.985
It sounds full.
And Mona wasn't very big.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.612
Okay.

26:01.660 --> 26:05.255
Mona was a lot of things,
but she didn't deserve this.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.931
Denatured alcohol.
Antacid tablets.

26:16.970 --> 26:19.200
Water.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.835
Okay,
I didn't take chemistry.
It's biology.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.609
When you mix those together
in the right proportion,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.777
you can preserve a specimen--

26:26.810 --> 26:30.143
a frog, a pig fetus,
any vertebrate, really.

26:30.180 --> 26:34.355
And what if you
mix them wrong?

26:34.390 --> 26:37.689
It's corrosive.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.824
You turn whatever specimen
you have to sludge.

26:43.160 --> 26:46.220
So she's either being
pickled or dissolved?

26:46.270 --> 26:50.161
Did you really
just say that?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.736
Sorry.

26:53.910 --> 26:55.207
Should we open it?

27:02.080 --> 27:03.012
( gasps )

27:09.290 --> 27:10.257
Aria?

27:10.290 --> 27:12.121
Here to pick up,
right?

27:12.160 --> 27:14.219
No, I'm just--

27:14.260 --> 27:16.251
A guy called,
said you'd pick up
and hand deliver.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.928
Was his name--

27:18.970 --> 27:19.868
I'm here by myself.

27:19.900 --> 27:21.959
Delivery address is
34 Turning Leaf Lane.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.228
The cross streets--
Yeah.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.806
Yeah, I know where that is.
Thank you.

27:24.840 --> 27:25.864
Okay.

28:01.340 --> 28:03.843
Where have you been?
I need to talk to you.

28:03.880 --> 28:06.348
We're not gonna
talk about that.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.314
That is the least of
your problems.

28:08.350 --> 28:10.887
I called, I texted.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.808
Relax, Hanna.
I was not doing that.

28:12.850 --> 28:14.818
That is none of
your buSIness.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.819
Yes, it is.
And it's kind of
Ted's business, too.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.794
Jason? Why?

28:20.830 --> 28:22.798
Aren't you, like,
working for him now?

28:22.830 --> 28:26.220
Are you gonna
lose your job over this?

28:26.270 --> 28:29.797
Jason and I...
it was nothing.

28:29.840 --> 28:31.728
It wasn't nothing.

28:31.770 --> 28:33.203
Mom, he's Alison's brother.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.731
I am aware of that,
and it's not something

28:35.780 --> 28:38.305
I'm comfortable with either.

28:38.350 --> 28:40.443
What is going on?

28:40.480 --> 28:41.970
I mean, you love,
Ted, right?

28:42.020 --> 28:43.988
Because he really loves you
and he's...

28:47.320 --> 28:49.049
He's what, Hanna?

28:50.990 --> 28:53.288
He's just a really good guy,

28:53.330 --> 28:56.322
and I like him.
And I like him with you.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.726
And I don't want anything
to ruin that.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.200
Are you going to tell him?

29:06.010 --> 29:09.935
That is for me to decide,
not you.

29:15.550 --> 29:17.939
You sure
you wiped down everything?

29:17.990 --> 29:19.412
Only things I touched
were the light switch

29:19.450 --> 29:20.883
and the air duct covers.

29:20.920 --> 29:23.115
I think we're good.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.422
What if we left hair?

29:24.460 --> 29:26.849
Fiber? Skin cells?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.118
I think
you're being paranoid.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.823
Possibly,
ifI were being excessively
or unreasonably anxious,

29:31.870 --> 29:33.121
according to Merriam-Webster,

29:33.170 --> 29:34.990
but there is nothing
unreasonable or excessive

29:35.040 --> 29:36.496
about wanting to keep us
all out of jail.

29:36.540 --> 29:38.064
I'm being meticulous.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.169
Actually,
you're being a thesaurus,

29:40.210 --> 29:42.303
but I appreciate
your attention to detail.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.879
Done.
Security footage is wiped.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.444
No sign that
we were ever there.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.415
And no sign of that
blonde or Holbrook.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.348
We need to figure out a way
to tie Holbrook

29:57.390 --> 29:58.550
into that storage space

29:58.590 --> 30:00.353
without getting tied up
into it ourselves.

30:03.930 --> 30:05.898
We could always
call Toby.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.898
Tip him off.

30:07.940 --> 30:10.238
Let the cops find out
what was in that barrel.

30:10.270 --> 30:11.339
Opening that barrel
would have just been

30:11.370 --> 30:12.962
playing into Holbrook's hands.

30:13.010 --> 30:16.104
Besides, I really don't want
to risk Toby's job.

30:16.140 --> 30:17.607
When we have proof
that that's where
Holbrook does

30:17.640 --> 30:20.473
Ali's dirty work,
then_we'l| have _
somethIng to turn In.

30:20.510 --> 30:22.978
What about the lease?

30:23.020 --> 30:24.885
Could you maybe
get into their records?

30:24.920 --> 30:26.581
Find a renter's agreement
with a name?

30:26.620 --> 30:29.453
Yeah, shouldn't take long.

30:29.490 --> 30:30.559
Okay.

30:32.960 --> 30:36.350
Hey, I really
should have gone

30:36.400 --> 30:39.198
after that knife on my own.

30:39.230 --> 30:40.561
If it makes you
feel any better,

30:40.600 --> 30:42.932
Toby's not really
talking to me either.

30:42.970 --> 30:45.962
He's talking to me,
there's just...

30:47.370 --> 30:49.509
not really much to say.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.212
( cell phone chimes )

31:00.250 --> 31:02.252
( doorbell rings )

31:05.460 --> 31:06.427
What's the big secret?

31:06.460 --> 31:08.121
Hey, is your mom here?

31:08.160 --> 31:10.025
I was supposed to deliver
these to her,

31:10.060 --> 31:11.994
but I think
that something's up.

31:12.030 --> 31:13.668
ASHLEY: Hanna?
Who's at the door?

31:13.700 --> 31:15.258
It's Aria.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.097
ASHLEY: Tell her
we're still eating, please.

31:17.140 --> 31:19.199
Yeah. Just one_ second.
Go upstaIrs.

31:22.640 --> 31:23.971
Honey,

31:24.010 --> 31:25.944
whatever it is,
make it quick, okay?

31:25.980 --> 31:28.141
Yeah. No.
It's just a school thing.

31:28.180 --> 31:30.546
I'll be down in a couple
minutes, I promise.

31:38.190 --> 31:39.384
"Last night took me
by surprise.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.955
Glad I stayed for dessert.
Jason."

31:42.000 --> 31:42.989
Wait, what?

31:43.030 --> 31:44.019
Since when does
your mom bake?

31:44.070 --> 31:45.025
And why was Jason--

31:45.070 --> 31:46.162
This isn't Jason.

31:46.200 --> 31:47.963
_ This is Alison
tryIng to start trouble.

31:48.000 --> 31:49.991
Why? What do you and your mom
have to do with Jason?

31:50.040 --> 31:52.099
Forget about Jason.
I did this.

31:53.340 --> 31:56.036
Okay, I went to
see her in jail.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.002
I'm sorry.
You did what?

31:58.050 --> 31:59.244
I had to.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.145
Ithought
she was going after Caleb.

32:01.180 --> 32:02.442
When I heard about
that bloody knife--

32:02.480 --> 32:04.983
We agreed, Hanna,
none of us were supposed to.

32:06.690 --> 32:08.157
I spent the whole day

32:08.190 --> 32:09.418
running on her
hamster wheel
because of you.

32:09.460 --> 32:11.382
Well, I faced her
for all of us.

32:11.430 --> 32:14.297
And I told her to back off.
This is her, backing off.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.729
You should have told us.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.728
I'll tell the others, okay?
I promise.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.558
Just don't mention
the flowers, please.

32:22.200 --> 32:23.428
Fine.

32:31.080 --> 32:35.244
For a town where some pretty
awful things have happened,

32:35.280 --> 32:38.147
today, almost
nothing happened.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.353
Come on, something
must have happened.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.258
I responded to
a total of two calls.

32:45.290 --> 32:46.257
Hmm.

32:46.290 --> 32:49.453
An 11-26 and a 10-91L.

32:49.500 --> 32:52.628
So Rosewood is now safe
from an abandoned bicycle

32:52.670 --> 32:54.535
and an off-leash labradoodle.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.674
We haven't done this
In a thIe.

33:01.710 --> 33:03.200
I've missed it.

33:03.240 --> 33:05.242
Yeah, me too.

33:07.380 --> 33:09.712
You know, we haven't talked
about this college,

33:09.750 --> 33:12.617
the distance.
Maybe we should.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.084
We've been apart before.

33:15.120 --> 33:19.022
Yeah, but surfboard
or bricks and ivy,

33:19.060 --> 33:21.756
you're gonna be gone.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.394
I don't want to
hold you back,

33:24.430 --> 33:26.364
but I also can't get used
to the thought

33:26.400 --> 33:29.130
of you being
an ocean away.

33:29.170 --> 33:30.137
( cell phone chimes )

33:32.610 --> 33:35.773
Then maybe
you can come with me.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.675
You can learn how to surf.

33:41.320 --> 33:44.209
It's really chilly.
I'll close the window.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.547
( cell phone chimes )

33:49.820 --> 33:53.028
"Found something.
Call me."

33:55.260 --> 33:57.251
What did you and Caleb find?

33:57.300 --> 34:00.497
What did you
and Caleb find?

34:00.530 --> 34:02.191
I can't tell you.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.699
This isn't about telling.

34:06.740 --> 34:09.231
This is about not doing things
that will get you both,

34:09.280 --> 34:11.248
all of us,
in a lot of trouble.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.373
So whatever you did today,
thatsit

34:13.410 --> 34:15.412
I want it to stop.

34:15.450 --> 34:18.487
Whatever you say,
officer.

34:29.700 --> 34:31.565
Will you clear the dishes
please, Hanna?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.090
Sure.

34:35.500 --> 34:36.728
I've got dessert.

34:40.240 --> 34:44.449
All right,
here we go.

34:44.480 --> 34:46.698
Do we all
get a cookie, Ted, or...

34:46.750 --> 34:52.211
It's not just any cookie.
It's a peanut butter cookie.

34:52.250 --> 34:56.118
We shared one of these
the first day we met.

34:56.160 --> 34:57.855
And I was thinking,

34:57.890 --> 35:01.394
maybe we could share
one of these tonight.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.458
Ted.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.197
Hold on.

35:10.240 --> 35:13.107
I've still got a few more
formalities to get through.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.278
When I moved
to this town,

35:19.310 --> 35:23.519
I knew it would bring
tremendous change to my life.

35:24.920 --> 35:27.388
Turns out
that change was you.

35:27.420 --> 35:29.786
There's something
bigger than both of us

35:29.820 --> 35:32.618
that put you in my path.

35:32.660 --> 35:37.495
And I want to spend
the rest of our lives together

35:37.530 --> 35:39.896
being grateful
for the gift of you.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.763
Ashley,

35:44.970 --> 35:47.131
will you marry me?

35:54.980 --> 35:59.417
I need a minute to think.

36:15.570 --> 36:17.367
You just took her by surprise,
that's all.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.402
She's had a really long
stressful week at work,

36:19.440 --> 36:21.499
and you came home early.

36:21.540 --> 36:23.531
Well, either
she doesn't like surprises,

36:23.580 --> 36:27.277
or there's something wrong
with my timing.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.948
There's nothing
wrong with you, Ted.

36:28.980 --> 36:30.516
You did everything right.

36:30.550 --> 36:34.281
You just have to give her
a minute to take it all in.

36:37.620 --> 36:38.723
I will.

36:40.590 --> 36:41.727
Thanks, Hanna.

36:54.780 --> 36:56.577
I should have seen him out.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.649
He is such a good man.

37:12.290 --> 37:13.655
He deserves the truth.

37:56.100 --> 37:57.658
At this time next week,

37:57.700 --> 37:59.759
I'll have an actual office
in the back.

37:59.810 --> 38:01.038
Are you here
for your paycheck?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.708
Yeah.
Great.

38:02.740 --> 38:03.900
I think it's over
by the register.

38:03.940 --> 38:06.340
Oh, I can just--

38:06.380 --> 38:07.449
Oh, no, no, no.
Let me get it.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.549
It's my first payday
as boss,

38:08.580 --> 38:10.218
and kind of
looking forward to it.

38:14.090 --> 38:15.352
Soda?

38:15.390 --> 38:18.382
Don't like coffee.
Love caffeIne.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.386
Is this you
outside of work?

38:20.430 --> 38:23.820
I may have to rethink
that whole uniform idea.

38:23.860 --> 38:26.021
I'm not dressed up
or anything.

38:26.070 --> 38:27.526
Just picking up my check.

38:27.570 --> 38:29.765
Casual looks good on you.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.461
Thanks.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.534
Yeah.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.435
Can I ask you something?

38:34.480 --> 38:36.539
It's not work related,
I promise.

38:36.580 --> 38:38.946
Okay.

38:38.980 --> 38:40.607
What do you think
about that?

38:40.650 --> 38:42.948
It's cute buns_
on the boss man, rIght?

38:42.980 --> 38:47.314
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.564
Hey.
Did you need something?

38:59.600 --> 39:00.897
Egg.

39:00.930 --> 39:01.965
What?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.059
Egg.

39:04.100 --> 39:05.408
The cop was here,
so I waited.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.429
But you owe me.

39:06.470 --> 39:08.006
An egg.
I am sorry. I forgot.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.530
Come in.

39:09.580 --> 39:12.879
Can't really make paint
without a binder.

39:12.910 --> 39:13.945
Did I ruin your plans?

39:13.980 --> 39:15.845
I read a bit to pass the time.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.711
Got kind of sucked
into the local news.

39:17.750 --> 39:19.115
Anything exciting?

39:19.150 --> 39:21.118
There's nothing
but excitement around here.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.414
That body in your baclqard
is just the tip of the iceberg.

39:23.460 --> 39:25.587
Yeah. Not quite the town
you remember, huh?

39:25.630 --> 39:27.985
We left when I was a kid,
but I don't remember
anything like this.

39:30.600 --> 39:33.524
Were you really
friends with her?

39:33.570 --> 39:36.698
That girl
who murdered a classmate?

39:36.740 --> 39:40.164
Yeah, I was.
Not so much anymore.

39:40.210 --> 39:43.134
With her in the halls,
I can imagine why you'd
date a cop.

39:43.180 --> 39:45.045
Try next-door neighbor.

39:46.910 --> 39:49.470
Trying to get as far away
from her as possible?

39:49.520 --> 39:51.909
Earlier, I saw
the acceptance letters.

39:51.950 --> 39:54.384
Have you bothered
to open them yet?

39:56.620 --> 39:58.110
After everything
that's happened,

39:58.160 --> 40:00.082
I really don't know
ifI can handle anything

40:00.130 --> 40:01.995
as mundane as college.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.496
The iceberg runs deep.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.498
I bailed.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.996
After a semester.

40:10.040 --> 40:13.009
It's just a bunch of kids
sitting on bunk beds,

40:13.040 --> 40:15.838
trying to figure out what to do
with the rest of their lives.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.849
That sounds like the worst
sleep-away camp ever.

40:21.750 --> 40:25.914
So you just quit school
and traveled?

40:25.950 --> 40:29.909
I want to study art,
and then make it.

40:29.960 --> 40:31.518
Bought a ticket to Europe,

40:31.560 --> 40:32.822
haunted as many
museums as I could.

40:32.860 --> 40:35.590
I'd trade a sketch
or a canvas for room,

40:35.630 --> 40:38.463
board,
a ride to the next town.

40:38.500 --> 40:41.867
There's no rule that says
you have to go to college.

40:43.170 --> 40:44.159
If you want to,

40:44.200 --> 40:46.668
you can just...

40:46.710 --> 40:47.859
go.

40:47.910 --> 40:49.878
( cell phone chimes )

40:51.850 --> 40:52.839
You need to get that?

40:54.210 --> 40:55.438
No.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.980
So tell me about Italy.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.217
Well, it doesn't actually
begin in Italy.

41:03.260 --> 41:05.854
It started in London.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.995
Hey.

41:14.030 --> 41:15.167
Is your mom up?

41:17.140 --> 41:18.869
I think
she cried herself to sleep.

41:18.910 --> 41:21.265
Ted popped
the question tonight.

41:21.310 --> 41:22.732
And she cried?

41:22.780 --> 41:25.101
They still haven't
figured it out yet.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.539
Wait, have you been
with Spencer this whole time?

41:27.580 --> 41:28.808
You didn't even
call me back.

41:28.850 --> 41:30.909
Yeah.
I got your message.

41:35.320 --> 41:36.958
Listen,

41:36.990 --> 41:39.720
Spencer asked me
to look into something,

41:39.760 --> 41:42.228
andittook
longer than I thought.

41:42.260 --> 41:44.524
About the storage unit?

41:46.930 --> 41:49.694
I found out the name
on the rental agreement.

41:49.740 --> 41:52.163
Well, who rented it?
Holbrook? Alison?

41:54.680 --> 41:58.946
Hanna, that storage unit
is rented in your name,

41:58.980 --> 42:00.208
And I'm pretty sure

42:00.250 --> 42:02.718
that Mona's body
is hidden inside of it.
