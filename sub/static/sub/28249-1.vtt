01:13.316 --> 01:15.807
Hey kid, we got you on camera.

01:15.885 --> 01:18.330
Am I calling the cops
or your principal?

01:29.036 --> 01:30.288
I hear you're leaving us today.

01:30.325 --> 01:31.510
Got somewhere to go?

01:31.545 --> 01:33.345
Friend gave me a lead on a sublet.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.525
Yeah? How's your head?

01:35.562 --> 01:36.929
Depends.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.767
You hear that chopper landing too?

01:38.804 --> 01:40.559
How's your heart?

01:41.555 --> 01:44.189
Broken years ago. It's why I enlisted.

01:44.258 --> 01:46.554
You take care of that
next, you hear me?

01:46.595 --> 01:48.596
Sir, yes sir.

01:51.035 --> 01:52.435
Janet.

01:52.572 --> 01:55.841
Thank you for everything.

02:18.344 --> 02:21.112
- You did not just do that.
- What?

02:21.328 --> 02:22.895
What?

02:24.431 --> 02:26.389
- Alanna, come on.
- No, I get it.

02:26.460 --> 02:28.828
It... it could've been an emergency.

02:29.035 --> 02:30.936
Like this?

02:31.108 --> 02:33.741
Enzo and Bernie. Cough it up, fellas.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.772
My lung? You're too late.

02:35.809 --> 02:38.010
I hacked it into a
tissue 20 minutes ago.

02:38.044 --> 02:39.278
Your stash.

02:39.312 --> 02:41.480
Viagra, cough medicine,

02:41.514 --> 02:42.531
whatever else you've been hocking.

02:42.568 --> 02:44.038
No idea what you're talking about.

02:44.075 --> 02:47.453
Louis Mendoza nearly drowned
in a pudding cup this morning.

02:47.487 --> 02:49.822
He was high and excited.

02:49.856 --> 02:52.083
Death by chocolate. Who wouldn't be?

02:52.153 --> 02:53.993
Hey, that's a violation of my rights.

02:54.027 --> 02:55.594
Yeah, wait till I get
to the cavity search.

02:55.629 --> 02:57.731
Seducing me won't work either.

02:57.768 --> 02:59.131
Wake him up.

03:02.479 --> 03:04.012
He's not asleep.

03:07.474 --> 03:09.742
Hasn't been long.

03:13.085 --> 03:15.187
You got away clean.

03:23.574 --> 03:26.943
You know, most people
don't have a lifelong friend.

03:27.861 --> 03:30.195
I guess I'm most people now.

03:36.670 --> 03:38.937
Uh, yeah, this is Sarah.

03:41.185 --> 03:43.453
I don't understand.

03:44.577 --> 03:46.845
Uh, no, no, of course.
I'll be right down.

03:49.046 --> 03:50.113
Enzo...

03:50.150 --> 03:51.684
No, go, go.

03:51.918 --> 03:54.217
Nothing's changing here, sweetheart.

03:54.387 --> 03:56.306
- I'll be back, okay?
- Yeah.

04:03.823 --> 04:04.963
Hey Sarah,

04:04.998 --> 04:06.118
what's wrong with your pharmacy?

04:06.154 --> 04:07.366
They don't give out cough medicine?

04:07.400 --> 04:08.959
They do when someone's coughing.

04:08.996 --> 04:11.070
- He's selling it.
- What are you talking about?

04:11.107 --> 04:13.318
Gabriel, what'd you do, crawl here?

04:13.546 --> 04:15.747
Hey, go easy on him. Bernie died.

04:15.875 --> 04:17.910
Sign me out. We're taking a walk.

04:17.944 --> 04:20.043
Pops, I'm already late. I'm sorry.

04:20.081 --> 04:21.892
I'll make it up to you.

04:22.973 --> 04:24.457
How long has this been going on for?

04:24.584 --> 04:25.865
I just found out.

04:25.902 --> 04:27.853
Listen, tells you he's congested?

04:27.887 --> 04:29.388
Just say no.

04:32.325 --> 04:33.982
No, no, no, no, no!

04:35.240 --> 04:36.929
Pops, I got, like, one minute, okay?

04:36.963 --> 04:38.859
One minute. You got your whole future.

04:38.896 --> 04:40.532
Which is jeopardized
every time I'm late

04:40.567 --> 04:41.937
because of a bogus emergency.

04:41.974 --> 04:43.108
You see this?

04:43.145 --> 04:45.396
The world's tiniest violin.

04:46.013 --> 04:47.194
Buy me a coffee.

04:47.231 --> 04:49.552
The stuff at the home tastes
like I steeped my balls.

04:52.612 --> 04:53.922
One coffee.

04:56.316 --> 04:58.083
Sarah told me about Bernie.

04:58.118 --> 04:59.272
I don't want to talk about it.

04:59.309 --> 05:01.820
Do you want to talk about why
you're selling cough medicine?

05:01.855 --> 05:03.499
I'm a river to my people.

05:03.538 --> 05:06.158
I'm sorry about Bernie, I am.

05:06.343 --> 05:08.427
Okay, but you can't tell me
you're sick if you're not

05:08.461 --> 05:09.921
and you can't sell drugs to old people.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.240
Did you just tip a ten?

05:11.277 --> 05:12.577
Eh, big deal. Bill another hour.

05:12.624 --> 05:14.664
I don't bill hours. I'm in law school.

05:14.934 --> 05:16.225
Seriously?

05:18.397 --> 05:19.924
Sit.

05:28.214 --> 05:29.424
You look good.

05:29.502 --> 05:30.725
You look good too.

05:30.784 --> 05:33.173
I look like somebody
beat me with a baseball bat

05:33.210 --> 05:36.246
and sewed me into a
costume I can't take off.

05:37.180 --> 05:39.348
I don't wanna live there, Gabie.

05:39.492 --> 05:40.793
The home?

05:40.889 --> 05:42.823
Well, what's the alternative?

05:43.630 --> 05:45.531
Oh, come on. It's a one bedroom.

05:45.565 --> 05:47.108
I got a girlfriend.

05:47.182 --> 05:49.071
We're... we're intimate.

05:49.108 --> 05:51.110
That's what stoops are for.

05:51.805 --> 05:53.239
Gimme a shot, kid.

05:53.406 --> 05:55.923
Bernie didn't age out, you know, he...

05:55.972 --> 05:57.998
he was bored to death.

05:58.645 --> 06:00.637
I ain't done living.

06:00.914 --> 06:03.482
You know you forget things.

06:03.672 --> 06:05.574
It's better for you there.

06:08.461 --> 06:11.296
It can't be the scariest
building you've ever entered.

06:12.521 --> 06:14.301
Different kind of scary.

06:15.662 --> 06:17.129
Here you go.

06:17.189 --> 06:18.323
Thanks for the ride.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.113
Thanks for your service.

06:28.275 --> 06:30.043
Staff Sergeant Porter.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.365
Just Nick is fine. And you are?

06:32.402 --> 06:34.269
I'm Ron, I'm The Village super.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.418
- Uh, I got your key.
- Okay.

06:35.488 --> 06:38.517
Look, the whole building is
very excited to have you, son.

06:38.551 --> 06:40.127
Yeah, why is that?

06:40.244 --> 06:41.511
Very patriotic.

06:41.574 --> 06:42.854
Uh, let me give you
a hand with that bag.

06:42.890 --> 06:45.124
Nope, it's okay. I got it.

06:46.127 --> 06:47.336
Arms still work.

06:50.263 --> 06:52.865
They did tell you it was a walk
up, right?

06:54.037 --> 06:56.505
No one patriotic on the first floor?

06:58.110 --> 06:59.344
Kidding.

06:59.381 --> 07:01.784
Just, uh...

07:01.975 --> 07:04.243
don't tell my team I
gave up my gear, huh?

07:04.909 --> 07:06.026
I got it.

07:06.063 --> 07:07.012
Your secret's safe.

07:07.046 --> 07:08.614
You're under this roof, you're family.

07:08.648 --> 07:09.784
Come on.

07:10.550 --> 07:12.451
So what do you think?

07:14.878 --> 07:16.216
She's a decorator.

07:16.253 --> 07:18.521
No, he. Him.

07:18.638 --> 07:22.097
Tim and Felipe,
they're in Rome teaching English.

07:22.395 --> 07:25.112
I don't know if you were told,
but they're refusing rent.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.206
I don't understand.

07:28.316 --> 07:30.584
Tim lost a brother in Iraq.

07:30.737 --> 07:32.237
Speaking of,

07:32.326 --> 07:35.795
let me be the first to say
thank you for your service.

07:37.284 --> 07:38.518
Yeah.

07:40.107 --> 07:42.612
Guessing that, uh,
I'm not the first, huh?

07:42.649 --> 07:45.250
Nah, it's fine. Um, thank you.

07:46.501 --> 07:49.103
Everybody means well, it just...

07:49.255 --> 07:52.291
well, it sounds like
they're ordering a latte.

07:53.299 --> 07:55.233
You mind if I ask how it happened?

07:56.763 --> 07:58.300
Uh...

07:59.090 --> 08:01.323
IED took out our Humvee.

08:02.309 --> 08:04.603
Driver was killed instantly, um...

08:05.104 --> 08:07.092
a couple of other guys
were picked off by snipers.

08:07.201 --> 08:09.741
- Oh.
- I was able to find cover.

08:09.833 --> 08:11.374
You're lucky to be alive.

08:11.463 --> 08:12.963
No, it wasn't luck.

08:13.046 --> 08:15.288
It was a bomb dog named Jedi.

08:15.982 --> 08:17.670
Sensed I was in distress

08:17.787 --> 08:19.639
and crawled on top
of me to keep me safe

08:19.758 --> 08:22.026
even though his leg was crushed.

08:22.789 --> 08:25.257
Kept me warm until they pulled me out.

08:26.960 --> 08:30.695
Look, I own this little bar, Smalls.

08:31.030 --> 08:33.332
I could sure use a hand.

08:33.585 --> 08:36.101
You know, I'm still a little
iffy on the old peg leg, so...

08:36.135 --> 08:39.538
No, business is slow
and there's a stool.

08:39.710 --> 08:42.441
Come on, let's take a tour of
the neighborhood and pop in.

08:42.530 --> 08:44.509
Thank you. Yeah,
I'm actually waiting for a delivery.

08:44.544 --> 08:46.178
Give 'em your cell.

08:46.212 --> 08:50.148
Come on, this is the first day
of the rest of your life, son.

08:50.253 --> 08:52.387
Come on now, let's get out there.

08:53.560 --> 08:55.458
What's been going on with you lately?

08:55.495 --> 08:57.196
Nothing,
I was suspended for crocheting.

08:57.294 --> 08:58.521
For vandalism.

08:58.558 --> 09:00.758
You know, I hear the punishment
for needlepoint is crucifixion.

09:00.794 --> 09:02.729
What possessed you to cut up a fence?

09:02.829 --> 09:04.192
The price of zip-ties go up?

09:04.229 --> 09:05.897
No, they're building corporate offices

09:05.932 --> 09:07.269
for Allied Dynamics.

09:07.306 --> 09:09.473
- And you heart them?
- And I don't want a war-profiteering

09:09.510 --> 09:11.136
missile manufacturer in my backyard.

09:11.170 --> 09:13.005
Okay, okay, so... so it was a...

09:13.039 --> 09:14.608
a crocheted political statement?

09:14.645 --> 09:18.047
Katie, what the hell is your problem?

09:29.238 --> 09:31.273
You are not pregnant.

09:32.384 --> 09:34.418
What are you, wishing it away?

09:34.594 --> 09:36.201
You're not having sex.

09:36.396 --> 09:37.696
Well, if that's your second wish,

09:37.730 --> 09:39.650
your third one should definitely have
some dollar signs.

09:39.686 --> 09:40.736
Who were you having sex with?

09:40.960 --> 09:42.261
Beat it!

09:42.514 --> 09:43.945
Mom.

09:48.408 --> 09:51.243
Hey, I am asking you to explain this.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.578
You know, I think it's
pretty widely understood.

09:53.613 --> 09:55.824
- Like how to use a condom?
- Condoms!

09:55.861 --> 09:57.449
See, we used a banana peel.

09:57.526 --> 09:59.185
Nobody's laughing, Katie.

09:59.222 --> 10:00.723
Then what are you doing?

10:00.760 --> 10:03.030
Judging me, seriously?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.257
You did the same thing, Mom,

10:05.291 --> 10:08.527
which means you know
exactly how scared I am.

10:08.636 --> 10:12.308
The part where I screwed
up, I am crystal clear on.

10:12.656 --> 10:15.359
Stop, that's my third wish.

10:17.619 --> 10:20.154
Really? Wish three?

10:21.026 --> 10:23.407
You could've made
Beyoncé your best friend.

10:24.243 --> 10:25.956
Yeah, well, I already have one of those

10:25.993 --> 10:28.828
and I just totally blew it with her.

10:31.167 --> 10:32.740
Do-over?

10:36.349 --> 10:37.925
I'm pregnant.

10:43.294 --> 10:45.262
It's gonna be okay.

11:01.881 --> 11:04.116
What the...?

11:05.818 --> 11:07.452
You're kidding me.

11:09.748 --> 11:11.228
- Detention center?
- You are undocumented.

11:11.264 --> 11:13.291
This is my home!
No, no, I have my paperwork!

11:13.326 --> 11:14.960
I need you to calm down, ma'am.

11:14.994 --> 11:16.595
Ben, tell them you know me.

11:16.722 --> 11:19.097
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

11:19.132 --> 11:20.799
What's... okay, relax.
What's going on here?

11:20.833 --> 11:22.901
They're harassing me for being brown.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.433
Okay, this... this is my
building, okay?

11:25.538 --> 11:27.806
She's legal.
I know her, she's my neighbor.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.474
There's a warrant.

11:29.509 --> 11:30.609
For what?

11:30.643 --> 11:32.811
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, relax, relax.

11:32.845 --> 11:35.614
It's okay. This is obviously a mistake.

11:39.644 --> 11:43.275
Ava, if they have a warrant...

11:45.219 --> 11:47.793
they're not... they're not
just gonna walk away.

11:50.658 --> 11:52.525
What are you saying?

11:52.575 --> 11:54.275
I should go with them?

11:55.425 --> 11:56.902
I've done nothing wrong!

11:56.936 --> 11:58.670
Okay, then don't do
something wrong now.

11:58.704 --> 12:00.285
- What?
- Mom?

12:00.566 --> 12:01.878
Why... why is he home?

12:01.915 --> 12:03.390
He's sick.

12:03.847 --> 12:05.373
Take your hands off my son!

12:05.410 --> 12:07.010
- I'm calling Family Services.
- That's enough!

12:07.046 --> 12:09.385
- That's enough, I will take him.
- Okay.

12:09.422 --> 12:11.690
She will go with you peacefully.

12:13.412 --> 12:15.679
We will get this figured out.

12:16.612 --> 12:18.213
What's happening?

12:18.286 --> 12:20.902
Sami, these men made a mistake, okay?

12:20.959 --> 12:23.079
I'm gonna go and clear it up.

12:30.198 --> 12:32.466
You need to let me go, okay? Okay.

12:32.958 --> 12:34.847
It's okay.

12:35.559 --> 12:38.138
Please... please call Patricia.

12:38.621 --> 12:40.689
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:40.809 --> 12:42.676
Why are you letting them take her?

12:42.782 --> 12:47.212
- I... Sami!
- Mom! Mom!

12:48.501 --> 12:50.019
<i>That doesn't make any sense.</i>

12:50.056 --> 12:51.389
They were waiting for her?

12:51.424 --> 12:52.891
<i>Patricia, I'm gonna need your help.</i>

12:52.925 --> 12:54.242
<i>Can you make it down to immigration?</i>

12:54.279 --> 12:55.613
Of course, Ben.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.459
Um, I'm in a meeting right now,

12:57.496 --> 12:59.839
but I'll-I'll get down
there as soon as I can.

13:00.248 --> 13:01.383
Where's Sami?

13:01.420 --> 13:03.638
<i>Oh, I got him. Talk soon.</i>

13:03.765 --> 13:06.538
Okay.

13:10.443 --> 13:11.857
So...

13:11.999 --> 13:13.900
good news?

13:17.660 --> 13:19.161
Overkill, much?

13:19.547 --> 13:21.810
Why didn't you tell
me you have a boyfriend?

13:22.067 --> 13:23.642
Because I don't.

13:24.457 --> 13:27.225
But you do know who the
potential father is, right?

13:28.094 --> 13:29.982
Well, I definitely
have it narrowed down

13:30.019 --> 13:31.096
to the basketball team.

13:31.130 --> 13:32.381
I'm not trying to slut-shame you.

13:32.490 --> 13:34.566
Yeah, I'm just gonna go
drown myself in the toilet.

13:34.724 --> 13:36.295
Do you like him?

13:36.804 --> 13:38.638
This boy?

13:38.712 --> 13:40.223
Yeah.

13:40.435 --> 13:42.374
Does he like you?

13:44.139 --> 13:46.373
I think so.

13:50.383 --> 13:52.216
Are you gonna tell him?

13:52.805 --> 13:54.639
Well, it's gonna be awkward now.

13:54.854 --> 13:56.849
All three means triplets, right?

13:59.757 --> 14:01.758
Katie, Katie,

14:01.795 --> 14:03.362
please don't walk away.

14:03.399 --> 14:05.007
Hey, look at me.

14:05.131 --> 14:06.273
I love you and...

14:06.310 --> 14:07.966
Can we please not talk about abortion

14:08.000 --> 14:09.301
in a nursing home hallway?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.146
Is that what you're going to do?

14:11.280 --> 14:14.115
You think I want some kid
who's going to ruin my life?

14:14.216 --> 14:15.864
You did not ruin my life.

14:15.914 --> 14:17.882
Look around, Mom.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.201
Katie, listen,

14:23.376 --> 14:25.991
having you was impossibly hard

14:26.152 --> 14:28.117
and I do not want
that struggle for you,

14:28.366 --> 14:30.452
- but I'm okay...
- No.

14:30.796 --> 14:32.430
No, you're amazing,

14:32.558 --> 14:35.460
which is why you could've
had so much more,

14:35.809 --> 14:38.077
but instead you had me.

14:38.913 --> 14:40.514
- Sarah!
- Oh, damn it.

14:40.551 --> 14:41.685
I need you.

14:41.722 --> 14:43.010
- See you later.
- Um...

14:43.047 --> 14:44.126
No, it's fine.

14:44.163 --> 14:46.897
It's your boss.
We can't both get suspended.

14:48.184 --> 14:50.485
Uh, can... can you give
me just one minute?

14:59.327 --> 15:01.328
Ava?

15:01.518 --> 15:03.086
Oh!

15:04.026 --> 15:06.027
I came as soon as I could.

15:06.225 --> 15:08.493
I'm so sorry, baby.

15:12.860 --> 15:15.762
Ten years I've lived here.

15:15.812 --> 15:18.514
I pay taxes here, I gave birth here.

15:18.704 --> 15:21.516
They just told me that
your papers are forged.

15:21.632 --> 15:23.767
Is that true, Ava?

15:23.804 --> 15:25.004
I don't know.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.442
You don't have to lie to me.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.152
I'm not lying.

15:29.415 --> 15:32.684
It could be true.
I didn't speak the language.

15:32.813 --> 15:35.520
My ex-husband handled
all the paperwork.

15:35.649 --> 15:37.321
I trusted him.

15:37.556 --> 15:39.838
Well, now you're gonna trust me.

15:40.858 --> 15:43.579
I'm gonna find you a lawyer, okay?

15:43.688 --> 15:44.970
With what money?

15:45.007 --> 15:46.896
I know, but listen to me,

15:48.239 --> 15:50.373
you've been caged twice
before in your life,

15:50.410 --> 15:51.540
once in your country

15:51.577 --> 15:53.057
and then in your marriage
and what did you do?

15:53.093 --> 15:54.406
You fought because you're a fighter.

15:54.440 --> 15:55.669
That's what you're gonna do now.

15:55.706 --> 15:57.974
I want you to say that to me.

16:00.923 --> 16:02.573
I'm going to fight.

16:03.576 --> 16:04.910
Ava...

16:08.384 --> 16:10.652
I want you to think of Sami.

16:11.966 --> 16:14.467
Now you say it to me again.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.634
I'm going to fight.

16:23.852 --> 16:28.473
These poor men laid a
trap for a defenseless woman

16:29.200 --> 16:32.436
who have no idea they just
caught themselves a tiger.

16:38.844 --> 16:39.932
That's it.

16:40.076 --> 16:43.345
Like you're churning ice
cream with your body.

16:43.484 --> 16:44.984
What are you humping chairs for?

16:45.136 --> 16:46.305
Wait for it.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.294
And we're churning, and we're churning,

16:49.328 --> 16:50.828
Aye, booty.

16:50.899 --> 16:52.321
At the expense of your pride.

16:52.358 --> 16:54.158
It's a small price to pay.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.461
Come on,
they left the loading docks open.

16:57.743 --> 16:59.410
Let's go live a little.

16:59.492 --> 17:00.953
For Bernie.

17:09.060 --> 17:11.262
Come on.

17:13.063 --> 17:14.663
Ta-da!

17:14.854 --> 17:16.387
Okay, look,
I... I know what you're thinking.

17:16.422 --> 17:17.518
Yeah? I didn't mean it.

17:17.555 --> 17:19.047
No, no, wait till you get inside.

17:19.084 --> 17:20.685
Come on.

17:20.826 --> 17:24.117
In the '60s,
this bar was a haven for freethinkers.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.805
Now when not all people
could go everywhere,

17:26.842 --> 17:29.110
all people could come here,

17:29.264 --> 17:30.898
and come they did.

17:31.003 --> 17:32.383
Mmm.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.420
Yeah, it's cool.

17:34.673 --> 17:37.485
No, no, see, you're not getting it.

17:38.413 --> 17:41.860
Jackie Robinson,
Langston Hughes, Dr. King,

17:41.942 --> 17:44.644
and up on that stage, Ella Fitzgerald,

17:44.685 --> 17:46.820
Cecil Taylor,

17:47.019 --> 17:49.053
Sonny Rollins.

17:49.313 --> 17:53.133
I mean, this whole room
filled with smoke and poetry.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.078
I swear, sometimes in the quiet,

17:57.245 --> 17:59.479
I can still hear their ghosts.

17:59.852 --> 18:01.219
And what do they say?

18:01.306 --> 18:05.008
What's a guy gotta do to
get a drink around here?

18:05.190 --> 18:07.458
Enzo?

18:07.540 --> 18:08.673
What are you doing here?

18:08.836 --> 18:11.664
We busted out of that suicide
parlor they call a home.

18:12.953 --> 18:15.844
Meet my new barkeep,
Staff Sergeant Porter.

18:15.881 --> 18:19.047
Just Nick and maybe.

18:25.504 --> 18:26.904
It's nice to meet you.

18:27.260 --> 18:30.262
Army Specialist Lorenzo Napolitano.

18:30.555 --> 18:33.097
Thank you for your sacrifice, Sergeant.

18:33.227 --> 18:35.366
George Reese, 51st radio company.

18:35.477 --> 18:36.968
Nice to meet you, sir.

18:37.124 --> 18:41.602
Petty Officer Third Class,
Walter Barns, USS Valley Forge.

18:41.743 --> 18:43.289
It's an honor.

18:49.766 --> 18:51.406
Oh sorry, honey.

18:52.007 --> 18:53.103
Time's up.

18:53.140 --> 18:54.464
There's a clock on self-pity?

18:54.501 --> 18:56.335
No, it's just this closet.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.137
It's the only one
without a smoke detector.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.031
We have it heavily scheduled.

19:00.101 --> 19:02.436
Velma, I can't let you smoke that.

19:06.385 --> 19:08.386
If we're not smoking, we're talking.

19:08.647 --> 19:10.008
Spill.

19:12.586 --> 19:16.155
Katie blames herself
for my unhappiness.

19:16.454 --> 19:18.722
Are you unhappy?

19:20.490 --> 19:21.720
It's just...

19:21.882 --> 19:24.791
the situation... it's a little
more complicated than that.

19:24.828 --> 19:26.332
Well, while you're un-complicating it,

19:26.366 --> 19:29.367
Bernie's grandson is here
packing up his things.

19:29.404 --> 19:30.619
He's cute.

19:30.656 --> 19:33.806
If I was 34, I'd jump him like a rope.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.164
Velma, his grandfather just died.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.712
Gather your rosebuds, carpe the diem,

19:39.746 --> 19:41.602
ask the kid to coffee.

19:41.696 --> 19:44.563
Maybe give your daughter
less to blame herself for.

19:46.265 --> 19:47.766
Come on.

19:49.413 --> 19:51.266
It's called a matzo ball.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.394
Had a partner who claimed they
worked better than aspirin.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.257
You're worried about your mom, huh?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.024
Sami...

20:03.651 --> 20:05.383
you can talk to me.

20:09.230 --> 20:10.867
Be right back.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.237
Hey, um...

20:15.382 --> 20:17.992
I need to bring a kid
down to the station.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.071
Yeah, yeah, I just need
someone to keep an eye on him

20:20.108 --> 20:21.492
- till my shift's over...
- Hey, Officer.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.289
I think your perp just escaped.

20:32.084 --> 20:34.352
<i>Look, I totally get it. It's awful.</i>

20:34.389 --> 20:35.869
Listen, the pro bono attorneys

20:35.906 --> 20:37.266
are up to their ears
in hundreds of cases.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.540
At least they actually know the law.

20:38.576 --> 20:40.539
And you actually know Ava and Sami!

20:40.574 --> 20:42.764
I'm a social worker, I've seen this,

20:42.801 --> 20:44.385
but she can't afford real help.

20:44.422 --> 20:47.479
Inexperienced help that gives
a damn is the next best thing.

20:47.516 --> 20:49.162
Patricia, I can't practice law yet.

20:49.199 --> 20:50.466
I was already late to my internship.

20:50.503 --> 20:51.870
I can't be late to class too.

20:51.907 --> 20:53.741
She's our neighbor, Gabe.

20:53.854 --> 20:55.421
We help.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.492
Pop stole my credit card.

21:01.552 --> 21:02.734
I gotta go.

21:02.813 --> 21:04.830
I'll drop by, see what I can find out.

21:04.911 --> 21:06.978
It's all I can promise.

21:08.465 --> 21:10.297
Hey, hey, hey!

21:15.146 --> 21:16.279
Hey.

21:16.422 --> 21:17.910
Um, I'm John.

21:18.399 --> 21:20.122
Sarah.

21:20.313 --> 21:22.766
I'm so sorry about Bernie.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.280
Oh yeah, thanks. Me too.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.685
Uh, mostly that I
didn't know him better.

21:26.821 --> 21:28.656
He seems to have liked the mafia.

21:30.490 --> 21:33.008
He said he had a son in Seattle.

21:33.189 --> 21:35.588
- Your dad?
- Yeah, they, uh...

21:35.662 --> 21:37.485
they had a falling out years ago.

21:37.571 --> 21:40.165
My only adult excuse is distance.

21:40.211 --> 21:42.752
Ironically, I just moved here

21:42.789 --> 21:44.470
kind of hoping to
start another chapter...

21:44.547 --> 21:47.375
I'm sorry,
do you... do you smell pastries?

21:47.531 --> 21:52.044
No, but that's because you
can't really smell yourself.

21:52.289 --> 21:53.588
You smell like baked goods?

21:53.625 --> 21:56.682
I'm a pastry chef.

21:56.867 --> 22:00.735
Just rented a storefront,
been testing recipes and...

22:00.844 --> 22:02.321
You think that's odd.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.164
No, no, no, I, uh,

22:04.492 --> 22:07.059
I was actually thinking if we
all smelled like where we work,

22:07.093 --> 22:08.867
I should never step outside again.

22:08.930 --> 22:10.996
I'm sure you smell great.

22:11.304 --> 22:14.039
My daughter vomited in
my purse this morning.

22:16.514 --> 22:17.948
I should go.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.213
Uh, so nice meeting you.

22:20.271 --> 22:22.506
Yeah, you too.

22:28.577 --> 22:29.825
Uh, so listen,

22:29.862 --> 22:32.188
for reasons I'm not really
comfortable getting into,

22:32.274 --> 22:35.547
I need to look happy and
fulfilled for my daughter,

22:35.755 --> 22:37.189
and for an entirely separate reason

22:37.226 --> 22:38.726
that I definitely will not discuss,

22:38.763 --> 22:39.946
I need to look like I'm not

22:39.983 --> 22:41.875
catastrophically single tonight.

22:44.580 --> 22:47.015
Sorry, are you asking me out?

22:48.568 --> 22:50.336
Only if the answer is yes.

22:51.149 --> 22:53.352
I can't handle rejection today.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.455
<i>A ham sandwich walks into a bar,</i>

23:08.492 --> 23:10.750
the bartender says we
don't serve food here.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.066
Uh-oh.

23:14.601 --> 23:16.238
Hey, here's my grandson?

23:16.275 --> 23:18.716
I buy you a coffee,
you steal my credit card?

23:19.387 --> 23:21.088
Oh, I have no idea, you know?

23:21.125 --> 23:22.559
I forget things, remember?

23:22.630 --> 23:25.232
What are you doing here, Pops?
Who signed you out?

23:25.438 --> 23:26.872
What am I, a library book?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.305
Look, you can't up and disappear.

23:28.342 --> 23:29.408
They'll call the cops.

23:29.442 --> 23:30.642
I haven't heard any sirens.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.426
I'm calling the home.

23:34.148 --> 23:36.516
What the hell are you doing?

23:36.752 --> 23:38.353
I don't need some kid tattling.

23:38.528 --> 23:41.630
Some kid, you serious?
After everything I've done?

23:42.574 --> 23:44.341
Give me the card.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.961
We need it for a car service.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.796
Bernie and I were planning
a little trip down...

23:50.830 --> 23:53.098
Yeah, you're... you're
not going on a trip.

23:54.484 --> 23:56.250
This'll get you home.

23:57.709 --> 23:59.744
Give me the card.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.980
And the bad news is
we're closing early.

24:08.014 --> 24:10.942
But the good news is we
throw a little shindig

24:10.979 --> 24:13.434
on the Village roof every third Friday.

24:13.534 --> 24:15.120
Uh, it's not the third Friday.

24:15.155 --> 24:17.073
- I bumped it for you.
- Oh.

24:17.110 --> 24:18.791
I hope you like shaking hands.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.426
Now I'm gonna give Sarah a call

24:20.460 --> 24:23.462
and have her sign you
three out for real.

24:23.558 --> 24:26.193
Uh, here. Hang on.

24:26.712 --> 24:28.980
They got a little trip to take first.

24:30.301 --> 24:31.683
Thank you.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.220
It's my pleasure.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.442
I shouldn't even be telling you,

24:41.479 --> 24:43.144
but she might need you.

24:43.354 --> 24:45.865
<i>Of course. I won't say a word.</i>

24:46.910 --> 24:49.472
Who am I kidding? I'm telling
you because I might need you.

24:49.550 --> 24:52.886
You already have me
24/7, you know that.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.294
See you on the roof?

24:55.485 --> 24:57.776
Yeah. Thank you.

25:24.791 --> 25:28.113
Mama.

25:30.435 --> 25:31.669
There you are.

25:31.888 --> 25:33.970
Sorry, "mama" is the
only word she knows.

25:34.458 --> 25:36.092
Come here, want to go to the park?

25:36.212 --> 25:38.259
Look, she's not a mommy.

25:38.409 --> 25:41.178
<i>Which way should we go?</i>

25:41.215 --> 25:42.582
<i>You want to go to the park?</i>

25:52.450 --> 25:54.216
Sorry, gents, closed for maintenance.

25:54.376 --> 25:57.611
When I was 22,
my friend and I worked here.

25:58.697 --> 26:00.565
We lost him today.

26:02.224 --> 26:04.341
Well, what are you looking to do?

26:04.536 --> 26:06.437
Remember.

26:24.966 --> 26:26.175
Coming out?

26:29.662 --> 26:31.463
I guess I'll come in.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.306
Any session you want, man.
It's super healing.

26:41.552 --> 26:43.820
That sounds great, yeah. Thanks.

26:44.027 --> 26:45.388
Of course.

26:45.425 --> 26:47.693
Pow.

26:47.730 --> 26:49.230
What the hell is a "sound bath"?

26:49.267 --> 26:50.501
Uh, you lay on the ground.

26:50.538 --> 26:52.802
They rub a crystal bowl with a rock.

26:53.005 --> 26:54.539
It's outstanding.

26:54.675 --> 26:57.043
I need a drink. You want something?

26:57.837 --> 27:00.772
I do, but not booze.

27:01.221 --> 27:02.786
You go ahead.

27:02.892 --> 27:04.893
All right.

27:09.884 --> 27:11.685
I see you

27:11.859 --> 27:16.677
and my soul grows deep like the rivers.

27:17.260 --> 27:19.168
Langston Hughes?

27:19.729 --> 27:22.474
Ron Davis.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.395
You cannot change a couple of words

27:24.432 --> 27:26.366
and claim that as your own.

27:29.412 --> 27:30.980
It's my roof,

27:31.017 --> 27:32.751
I'll do as I like,

27:32.860 --> 27:35.487
and what I'd like to do right now...

27:36.513 --> 27:38.747
is dance with my lady.

27:48.888 --> 27:53.759
32 years dancing with the same woman,

27:53.997 --> 27:57.013
a man can feel when something is wrong.

27:57.403 --> 27:59.091
Patricia, what is it?

27:59.169 --> 28:00.646
It's just a...

28:00.850 --> 28:02.984
It's just a hard day.

28:08.450 --> 28:11.443
Just... it's just Ava.

28:17.847 --> 28:19.631
Hmm.

29:09.491 --> 29:11.750
You'll go before a judge
in the next couple days.

29:11.787 --> 29:14.127
Best case scenario,
he agrees to a grant bond.

29:14.678 --> 29:16.645
If you pay it,
you can fight your case from home.

29:16.748 --> 29:18.910
And if I'm deported...

29:19.256 --> 29:20.586
what happens to Sami?

29:20.623 --> 29:23.459
Well, he was born here
so he can stay or...

29:24.621 --> 29:26.274
you know, he... he could go with you.

29:26.311 --> 29:27.545
To Iran?

29:27.757 --> 29:29.977
- No.
- Look, Ava, you need someone good.

29:30.014 --> 29:33.373
I need a lot of things,
they aren't available to me.

29:33.532 --> 29:34.999
Neither am I.

29:35.065 --> 29:36.765
It's not because I
wouldn't love to help.

29:37.037 --> 29:40.035
I literally can't practice law yet.

29:42.966 --> 29:46.134
I was born in a place
where I had no voice.

29:47.001 --> 29:48.668
No hope of ever being heard.

29:49.272 --> 29:53.451
So I traveled 6,000 miles

29:53.917 --> 29:55.188
as a refugee,

29:55.225 --> 29:56.625
learned a new language,

29:56.662 --> 30:02.537
found work, bore a child,
and I took care of him alone.

30:03.460 --> 30:06.729
All so I can earn a voice,

30:07.664 --> 30:10.566
which I am using now to tell you this.

30:12.416 --> 30:14.951
There is always a way
around every obstacle,

30:14.988 --> 30:17.706
but you need to care enough to find it.

30:17.959 --> 30:19.909
Please care enough.

30:22.233 --> 30:23.493
The day you moved in,

30:23.530 --> 30:26.414
Sami thought a superhero had landed.

30:27.083 --> 30:30.286
Now I'm the guy who
lets bad guys take Mom.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.486
Guess it's time to fold up the cape.

30:35.523 --> 30:37.938
I don't know,
I think superheroes are overrated.

30:37.975 --> 30:40.334
They just fly in and save the day.

30:41.982 --> 30:44.078
Takes a real man to stick around

30:44.115 --> 30:45.682
and deal with the carnage.

31:00.150 --> 31:02.442
All right, everybody, eyes up here.

31:02.479 --> 31:03.879
Eyes up here.

31:04.068 --> 31:05.435
Come on now.

31:06.793 --> 31:09.105
<i>You've reached the Glasser
Cancer Treatment Center.</i>

31:09.140 --> 31:10.739
<i>Please leave your message at the tone.</i>

31:11.842 --> 31:13.286
Hi, this is Patricia Davis.

31:13.323 --> 31:14.575
I'm sorry to call so late,

31:14.612 --> 31:17.414
but I will take that 4:00 appointment.

31:17.451 --> 31:19.082
Thank you.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.522
All right, now my life, my love,

31:23.559 --> 31:26.628
my wife Patricia and I
would like to welcome

31:26.665 --> 31:29.403
Staff Sergeant Nick
Porter to the Village.

31:29.489 --> 31:31.321
Yay!

31:31.453 --> 31:34.288
Now Sarah, who volunteers at the VA,

31:34.338 --> 31:37.164
she brought him home knowing
that we would lift him up.

31:37.201 --> 31:41.037
So do so or at least
stop by and say hello.

31:41.071 --> 31:44.941
Nick, may you heal and
find new purpose here.

31:45.198 --> 31:46.599
Cheers!

31:46.696 --> 31:48.463
- Thank you.
- To Nick!

31:51.894 --> 31:55.497
Empty apartment, huh?
Might have a few leads on work?

31:55.586 --> 31:58.655
Yeah, I might have undersold
the whole Village experience.

31:58.878 --> 32:02.042
- Hmm.
- We're nothing if not enthusiastic.

32:02.413 --> 32:03.713
- John.
- Hey.

32:03.795 --> 32:05.696
Sarah told me about your ordeal.

32:05.745 --> 32:07.446
Thank you for your service.

32:08.599 --> 32:09.854
Thanks.

32:10.963 --> 32:12.294
Oh, sorry. Oh, you know what?

32:12.331 --> 32:16.065
I have a, uh,
delivery that's just showing up, um...

32:16.237 --> 32:17.419
It's great to meet you, John.

32:17.456 --> 32:19.791
- Yeah, you too.
- All right, excuse me.

32:21.431 --> 32:23.065
Did I say something wrong?

32:23.122 --> 32:24.923
No, I'm sure it's fine.

32:25.036 --> 32:26.369
Come on.

32:28.860 --> 32:31.688
So this daughter

32:31.722 --> 32:33.723
you need to look happy
and fulfilled for,

32:33.757 --> 32:35.825
am I gonna meet her here?

32:36.234 --> 32:39.569
It depends.
Do I look happy and fulfilled?

32:40.718 --> 32:42.085
You look pretty.

32:45.637 --> 32:48.458
So John, who smells like baked goods,

32:48.671 --> 32:51.715
late 30s, cross-country move,

32:52.536 --> 32:55.044
hoping for a new chapter?

32:56.130 --> 32:57.919
How long you been divorced?

33:00.952 --> 33:03.174
Long enough to know she wasn't the one.

33:03.606 --> 33:04.989
Do you believe in that?

33:05.056 --> 33:08.925
One in six billion is perfect for you?

33:10.168 --> 33:11.801
I like to believe in things.

33:18.819 --> 33:20.386
You're missing a party.

33:20.423 --> 33:22.221
Got a lot on my plate.

33:23.298 --> 33:25.666
I'm sorry for getting angry.

33:25.703 --> 33:27.070
I worry, you know?

33:27.344 --> 33:29.661
I shouldn't have taken your credit card

33:29.997 --> 33:32.015
or tossed your phone in a beer.

33:32.049 --> 33:33.750
Or sold drugs to old people.

33:33.784 --> 33:35.503
Ah, drugs are wasted on the young.

33:35.540 --> 33:36.880
Here.

33:37.177 --> 33:40.023
I couldn't find a peace pipe
so I settled on tequila.

33:40.057 --> 33:42.659
You okay?

33:42.693 --> 33:44.314
Sure.

33:44.662 --> 33:45.929
I'm gonna miss Bernie too.

33:45.963 --> 33:48.665
He gave me the worst dating advice.

33:48.841 --> 33:50.520
Big talk.

33:50.634 --> 33:53.102
The guy fell in love
with the ring toss girl

33:53.137 --> 33:55.004
and he married her a month later.

33:57.028 --> 33:58.808
It's kind of crazy you
met all your best friends

33:58.842 --> 34:00.503
at an amusement park.

34:00.611 --> 34:03.113
Family's where you find it, kid.

34:08.924 --> 34:11.792
Hey, hey! There he is!

34:11.960 --> 34:13.466
He's decommissioned. All yours.

34:13.503 --> 34:16.271
Come on, boy! What is it? What is it?

34:23.263 --> 34:24.574
Hey, uh...

34:26.204 --> 34:28.237
We don't normally kiss in public.

34:28.552 --> 34:31.987
Well,
it's a pretty liberal neighborhood.

34:33.728 --> 34:35.330
You're the new soldier guy?

34:35.426 --> 34:37.527
My mom told me that you were moving in.

34:39.717 --> 34:41.565
You're Sarah's daughter.

34:41.739 --> 34:43.358
Katie.

34:44.145 --> 34:45.722
I like your shirt.

34:46.797 --> 34:49.867
Uh, yeah,
I have a lot of issues with war.

34:50.362 --> 34:52.630
Me too.

34:53.563 --> 34:55.527
- Oh, I can help you.
- No, it's okay.

34:55.632 --> 34:57.487
It's okay. Thank you.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.223
I'm Nick Porter

35:03.823 --> 35:06.506
and this... this is Jedi.

35:06.698 --> 35:08.077
You guys just meet?

35:08.299 --> 35:09.880
Well, we got a little bit of history.

35:09.917 --> 35:13.565
Well, uh, it was nice to meet you.

35:13.633 --> 35:16.185
Yeah, it's nice to meet you too.

35:25.632 --> 35:27.149
Hey.

35:39.033 --> 35:40.572
Hey, this was nice.

35:40.618 --> 35:42.302
I'm pretty sure she just
picked him up somewhere.

35:42.339 --> 35:43.443
I think it's good.

35:43.480 --> 35:45.167
She'll need company
when you're in jail.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.294
Allied Dynamics?

35:48.331 --> 35:50.771
You're the one who said that
somebody needed to protest.

35:50.831 --> 35:52.840
Have you ever heard of a picket sign?

35:52.979 --> 35:55.311
You didn't teach me how
to crochet one of those.

35:57.580 --> 35:59.534
You are my kind of girl.

35:59.571 --> 36:01.137
Good night.

36:01.561 --> 36:03.352
Good night.

36:07.113 --> 36:08.746
<i>He seems nice.</i>

36:10.894 --> 36:12.735
<i>I heard about Ava.</i>

36:12.862 --> 36:15.295
<i>Yeah, I thought we could all</i>

36:15.464 --> 36:17.831
<i>pitch in helping Ben take care of Sami.</i>

36:17.940 --> 36:19.666
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

36:22.758 --> 36:24.925
<i>Sarah...</i>

36:25.190 --> 36:28.675
<i>whatever she decides,
she has one thing that you didn't have.</i>

36:30.714 --> 36:32.207
<i>You for a mother.</i>

36:47.726 --> 36:49.793
<i>Only a 17-year-old
would be on her phone</i>

36:49.865 --> 36:51.028
<i>with a view like this.</i>

36:51.065 --> 36:52.199
<i>You had a date.</i>

36:52.277 --> 36:54.396
<i>Bought a lottery ticket too.</i>

36:55.004 --> 36:57.800
<i>I could be rich and
married by next week.</i>

36:58.792 --> 37:01.041
<i>Well, if he's not a serial killer,</i>

37:01.078 --> 37:02.440
<i>he's kind of cute.</i>

37:03.225 --> 37:04.574
<i>And divorced.</i>

37:04.647 --> 37:06.246
<i>Any port in a storm.</i>

37:06.292 --> 37:08.183
<i>Oh, there's my daughter.</i>

37:09.081 --> 37:10.582
<i>Let me in.</i>

37:24.241 --> 37:28.815
<i>You know hard and happy
aren't mutually exclusive?</i>

37:30.019 --> 37:31.991
<i>Life can be both.</i>

37:33.480 --> 37:36.823
<i>And mine has been mostly.</i>

37:40.026 --> 37:44.058
<i>But you work so much because of me.</i>

37:44.503 --> 37:48.784
<i>I like my work, and you're worth it.</i>

37:51.354 --> 37:54.061
<i>Katie, I made these choices.</i>

37:54.128 --> 37:57.042
<i>Good or bad, they are not on you.</i>

38:02.433 --> 38:04.377
<i>I'm really scared.</i>

38:08.811 --> 38:10.034
<i>I got you, baby.</i>

38:12.214 --> 38:13.698
<i>I have got you.</i>

38:23.790 --> 38:25.706
<i>Hey, hey, hey, hey.</i>

38:25.823 --> 38:27.744
<i>How's your head, pal?</i>

38:28.263 --> 38:30.055
<i>Yeah, I'll bet.</i>

38:39.954 --> 38:41.950
<i>- Hi.
- Hey.</i>

38:42.011 --> 38:43.193
<i>- This is a bad time.
- No.</i>

38:43.230 --> 38:44.559
<i>- No, I'm sorry.
- No, look, it's not...</i>

38:44.596 --> 38:45.769
<i>it's not...</i>

38:45.806 --> 38:47.872
<i>It's not a bad time. I, uh...</i>

38:49.816 --> 38:51.319
<i>I just...</i>

38:52.402 --> 38:54.707
<i>I just would've preferred pants.</i>

38:56.402 --> 38:58.525
<i>Well, I would stare but
then I'd be missing out</i>

38:58.597 --> 39:00.794
<i>on one of the great smiles of all time.</i>

39:02.151 --> 39:03.350
<i>- See?
- Yeah.</i>

39:03.426 --> 39:04.753
<i>What leg?</i>

39:07.109 --> 39:08.433
<i>Nick, when you meet Katie...</i>

39:08.470 --> 39:09.965
<i>Actually...</i>

39:10.773 --> 39:12.305
<i>I already did.</i>

39:12.541 --> 39:14.230
<i>Oh.</i>

39:15.793 --> 39:17.355
<i>And?</i>

39:17.820 --> 39:19.320
<i>She's got your eyes.</i>

39:24.418 --> 39:26.361
<i>Did you tell her?</i>

39:26.822 --> 39:30.357
<i>You know, there wasn't really
a great segue into, uh...</i>

39:32.285 --> 39:34.294
<i>I'm your dad.</i>

39:34.831 --> 39:37.020
<i>Look, Sarah,
if I'm making things messy for you,</i>

39:37.132 --> 39:39.466
<i>- I have no right...
- No, it's okay.</i>

39:39.590 --> 39:41.668
<i>I do messy pretty well,</i>

39:42.071 --> 39:43.804
<i>and this isn't about me.</i>

39:46.215 --> 39:49.209
<i>I know we discussed
telling her right away,</i>
