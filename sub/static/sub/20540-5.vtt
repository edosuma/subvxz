[cheers and applause]

00:41.000 --> 00:44.300
- Welcome welcome, welcome
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.300 --> 00:45.166
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.133
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:47.133 --> 00:49.633
Just time for a quick recap
of the week.

00:49.633 --> 00:52.333
And on Wednesday, it was
International Women's Day.

00:52.333 --> 00:55.567
Or as I call it,
Int-her-national Women's Day.

00:55.567 --> 00:59.233
#Feminism.
#HashtagFeminism.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.233
And--and every year,
the best way of gauging

01:01.233 --> 01:02.533
not just how far
women have come,

01:02.533 --> 01:04.667
but perhaps how far
they still have to go,

01:04.667 --> 01:06.834
is by watching powerful men
around the world

01:06.834 --> 01:09.633
trip over their dicks
talking about the day.

01:09.633 --> 01:12.467
And let's start
with Vladimir Putin.

01:12.467 --> 01:16.867
- "Women give us life and
perpetuate it in our children.

01:16.867 --> 01:19.767
"We will do our utmost
to surround our dear women

01:19.767 --> 01:21.667
"with care and attention

01:21.667 --> 01:24.166
so that they can smile
more often."

01:24.166 --> 01:25.900
- Perfect.

01:25.900 --> 01:27.600
If there are two things
that women love,

01:27.600 --> 01:31.700
it's being told to smile more
and being surrounded.

01:31.700 --> 01:35.266
"Come on, baby, you're such
pretty gender when you smile.

01:35.266 --> 01:38.867
Give Vladimir a little twirl."

01:38.867 --> 01:41.700
But incredibly, Putin is
actually a model of sensitivity

01:41.700 --> 01:43.767
next to the speech
given by Brazilian president

01:43.767 --> 01:45.533
Michel Temer.

01:45.533 --> 01:49.900
- "Today women participate
strongly in the economy too.

01:49.900 --> 01:52.600
Nobody is more capable
of pointing out changes

01:52.600 --> 01:55.567
in supermarket prices
better than women."

01:55.567 --> 01:57.367
- Okay.
Okay.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.433
He just reduced
the economic contribution

01:59.433 --> 02:04.400
of half of Brazil's population
to "Women be shoppin', y'all."

02:04.400 --> 02:05.867
This year, though,
I would argue

02:05.867 --> 02:07.867
there was no more
spectacular celebration

02:07.867 --> 02:10.767
of International Women's Day
than in San Antonio, Texas,

02:10.767 --> 02:12.700
where one local
morning show host

02:12.700 --> 02:14.734
really gave it his all.

02:14.734 --> 02:16.500
- Today is
International Women's Day.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.500
So hey, ladies, don't worry.
It's your day.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.133
You can do whatever you want.

02:20.133 --> 02:21.600
And speaking of doing it,
whatever you want,

02:21.600 --> 02:22.633
it's workout Wednesday.

02:22.633 --> 02:24.066
It's time
to get that bikini body

02:24.066 --> 02:25.700
just in time for summer.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.734
- That's right, ladies.
You can do whatever you want.

02:28.734 --> 02:31.433
Crunches, curls,
maybe some light cardio.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.900
The point is, keep it tight.

02:32.900 --> 02:35.900
It's your day.
But keep it tight.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.700
And believe me,
he was just getting started.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.000
- All right,
so it's just me today.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.600
Kimberly's in traffic,
but it's okay.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.967
It's International Women's Day,
so she can do that today.

02:44.967 --> 02:48.033
This year, International
Women's Day will come together

02:48.033 --> 02:50.433
with "a day without,"
women being on strike.

02:50.433 --> 02:52.266
So that's a good thing,
because, you know,

02:52.266 --> 02:55.266
when it comes down to it,
that's where we all come from.

02:55.266 --> 02:57.300
- What?

02:57.300 --> 02:59.367
That is a pretty limited
understanding

02:59.367 --> 03:01.000
of human reproduction.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.967
I bet if you asked him to label
a chart of the female anatomy,

03:03.967 --> 03:06.700
he'd probably just write "noice"
across the top of it

03:06.700 --> 03:08.233
and call it a day.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.066
He went on and on and on.

03:10.066 --> 03:13.000
He attempted to ad-lib his way
through a whole story

03:13.000 --> 03:15.734
on International Women's Day
in a manner so incompetent,

03:15.734 --> 03:18.800
it really made you feel that
the stuck-in-traffic Kimberly

03:18.800 --> 03:21.934
probably does most of
the heavy lifting on that show.

03:21.934 --> 03:23.467
And, you know what,
in that sense,

03:23.467 --> 03:26.166
I'm not sure that anyone
this week managed to show better

03:26.166 --> 03:28.066
what a day without women
is all about.

03:28.066 --> 03:29.033
Because Kimberly?

03:29.033 --> 03:31.567
I don't know who you are
or what you do,

03:31.567 --> 03:35.133
but I sure as shit know what
happens when you're not there.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.834
And first thing tomorrow,
you need to go into the office

03:37.834 --> 03:40.266
and ask for a fucking raise.

03:40.266 --> 03:44.066
So for now--
for now, let's move on--

03:44.066 --> 03:47.700
let's move on to the CIA,
my employer--shit!

03:47.700 --> 03:49.066
I wasn't supposed to say that!

03:49.066 --> 03:52.600
Oh, fuck.
They're gonna be so mad with me.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.133
The CIA had a difficult week.

03:55.133 --> 03:56.934
- Tonight,
WikiLeaks has a bombshell,

03:56.934 --> 03:58.567
publishing these documents,

03:58.567 --> 04:00.600
what could be
the biggest exposure

04:00.600 --> 04:02.700
of U.S. intelligence
gathering methods

04:02.700 --> 04:04.500
since Edward Snowden's leak.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.900
- Well, well, well.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.867
The spy agency
has become the spied upon.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.100
And you have to admit

04:10.100 --> 04:12.533
there is a certain satisfaction
in seeing that.

04:12.533 --> 04:15.967
It's akin to going and shitting
on the neighborhood dog's lawn.

04:15.967 --> 04:19.867
How do you fucking like it?
How do you like it now?

04:19.867 --> 04:23.100
And the documents initially
sounded pretty alarming.

04:23.100 --> 04:24.233
- According to WikiLeaks,

04:24.233 --> 04:26.200
the CIA explored
the possibility

04:26.200 --> 04:29.100
of hacking into
the software of modern cars.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.600
- It can be accessed
from outside

04:30.600 --> 04:32.200
and perhaps taken control of,

04:32.200 --> 04:33.800
and this can let you
do a whole lot of things,

04:33.800 --> 04:35.133
from playing the music

04:35.133 --> 04:37.500
to taking control of the car
entirely and crashing it

04:37.500 --> 04:39.233
if you want
to assassinate somebody.

04:39.233 --> 04:43.300
- Well, that escalated quickly.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.066
"First I'll make them listen
to Coldplay,

04:45.066 --> 04:47.967
and then...it's murder."

04:47.967 --> 04:52.600
But listen again to how that
report characterized this news.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.700
- According to WikiLeaks,

04:53.700 --> 04:55.767
the CIA explored
the possibility

04:55.767 --> 04:58.633
of hacking into
the software of modern cars.

04:58.633 --> 04:59.600
- That's right.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.500
"They explored
the possibility of it."

05:01.500 --> 05:03.133
And that is important,
because we already knew

05:03.133 --> 05:05.567
that cars could
technically be hacked.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.200
So it's not surprising,
really, to hear

05:07.200 --> 05:09.900
that the CIA might be
interested in doing that too.

05:09.900 --> 05:12.633
But "exploring the possibility
of doing something"

05:12.633 --> 05:14.867
isn't really the same
as doing it.

05:14.867 --> 05:17.967
A partial list of things
that I've thought about doing

05:17.967 --> 05:19.700
but have not done includes:

05:19.700 --> 05:23.433
karate, chess, guitar,
becoming a wine guy,

05:23.433 --> 05:25.567
CrossFit, going vegan,
learning Spanish,

05:25.567 --> 05:27.567
alpaca farming,
volunteer fire fighting,

05:27.567 --> 05:29.867
and being a guy with a wood shop
who spends a year

05:29.867 --> 05:33.533
making, like,
the perfect birdhouse.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.667
But--but the thing is,

05:34.667 --> 05:37.700
this story ate up
a lot of media time this week.

05:37.700 --> 05:40.233
But the allegations were
slightly less alarming

05:40.233 --> 05:42.000
than early coverage suggested.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.500
Take another one
of the big claims.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.467
- A program called
Weeping Angel,

05:46.467 --> 05:49.200
which can remotely turn
a Samsung TV

05:49.200 --> 05:52.233
anywhere in the world
into a secret listening device.

05:52.233 --> 05:55.166
- One CIA hacking operation
called Weeping Angel...

05:55.166 --> 05:56.467
- Weeping Angel.

05:56.467 --> 05:59.133
- If you've got a Samsung TV,
it's--

05:59.133 --> 06:00.734
you think you're watching TV?

06:00.734 --> 06:02.934
Oh, honey.
That thing is watching you.

06:02.934 --> 06:05.166
- Okay, first.

06:05.166 --> 06:08.533
She should deliver
all of the news.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.500
"19 dead
in a blazing apartment fire,

06:10.500 --> 06:14.600
all of them children,
girlfriend."

06:14.600 --> 06:18.166
But second:
"Weeping Angel" sounds less like

06:18.166 --> 06:20.734
a spy program and more like
a tactic your mom uses

06:20.734 --> 06:22.500
to keep you from masturbating.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.700
"Look at the weeping angel,
David.

06:24.700 --> 06:27.900
You did that!
You made her cry!"

06:27.900 --> 06:31.033
But still, you can't argue that
the notion that the CIA

06:31.033 --> 06:32.433
can listen to anyone
in the world

06:32.433 --> 06:34.767
through their Samsung TV
is scary.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.100
But again,
if you read the documents,

06:37.100 --> 06:38.467
you'll find this program
applies

06:38.467 --> 06:41.433
to Samsung TVs
from 2012 and 2013,

06:41.433 --> 06:44.033
and the malware
was installed via USB.

06:44.033 --> 06:46.467
So presumably the CIA needed
to physically

06:46.467 --> 06:48.600
stick that into your TV.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.767
And even if that happened,
experts advise

06:50.767 --> 06:52.633
there's still actually a
potential way to circumvent it.

06:52.633 --> 06:54.900
It's a little complicated,
so I'll walk you through it.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.200
Step one: unplug the TV.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.900
And that is it.
End of steps.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.000
You're off the grid.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.667
But--but what is most important
to keep in mind here

07:04.667 --> 07:06.033
regarding these revelations is,

07:06.033 --> 07:08.000
the CIA,
with some narrow exceptions,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
is barred
from spying domestically.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.433
And unlike the Snowden leaks,

07:12.433 --> 07:14.900
there is nothing
in these documents so far

07:14.900 --> 07:16.934
showing illegal surveillance
of Americans.

07:16.934 --> 07:19.734
Which is not to say there wasn't
interesting stuff in there.

07:19.734 --> 07:22.367
For instance, Weeping Angel
was just the beginning

07:22.367 --> 07:25.000
of the CIA's stupid code names.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.533
- A range of CIA programs
with code names

07:27.533 --> 07:30.467
like AfterMidnight
and BrutalKangaroo,

07:30.467 --> 07:33.633
all now in the hands of
terrorists and foreign targets.

07:33.633 --> 07:37.567
- It's not just AfterMidnight
and BrutalKangaroo, though.

07:37.567 --> 07:41.333
Other programs were called
CrunchyLimeSkies, ElderPiggy,

07:41.333 --> 07:44.233
AngerQuake, and McNugget.

07:44.233 --> 07:45.633
Which are also, interestingly,

07:45.633 --> 07:48.066
the names of a cappella groups
at Dartmouth.

07:48.066 --> 07:50.900
You--you should really hear
CrunchyLimeSkies'

07:50.900 --> 07:52.133
rendition of "Roar."

07:52.133 --> 07:53.967
It is fierce.

07:53.967 --> 07:57.000
And look, I'm not saying that
these leaks are not a big deal.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.900
The mere fact that WikiLeaks
obtained these documents at all

07:59.900 --> 08:01.000
is significant.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.333
And more are apparently coming,

08:02.333 --> 08:03.900
so this story
is still developing.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.033
There's really only one thing
we can say for absolute sure

08:07.033 --> 08:09.300
at this point, and that is
that the big loser so far

08:09.300 --> 08:11.000
is Samsung.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.900
They have had
a rough couple of months.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.633
You probably remember
what happened with their phones.

08:16.633 --> 08:18.266
- Burning and melting.

08:18.266 --> 08:21.033
Samsung issuing
an unprecedented recall

08:21.033 --> 08:24.300
of millions of new
Galaxy Note7 smartphones.

08:24.300 --> 08:26.800
- Just wanted to post this
and share

08:26.800 --> 08:28.700
what just happened
to my Note7.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.767
Everyone rocking
the new Note7,

08:31.767 --> 08:33.433
it might catch fire, y'all.

08:33.433 --> 08:36.033
- Yeah.
That's not ideal.

08:36.033 --> 08:38.333
That is the worst thing
that can happen with a phone

08:38.333 --> 08:40.166
other than someone leaving
a voicemail

08:40.166 --> 08:43.333
instead of just texting you
like a normal person.

08:43.333 --> 08:46.667
And--and it is not just
Samsung's phones.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.934
- Washing machines exploding.

08:48.934 --> 08:50.266
- I'm totally scared.

08:50.266 --> 08:51.967
- Lids flying off.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.934
Samsung launching
a massive nationwide recall

08:54.934 --> 08:56.266
back in November.

08:56.266 --> 08:59.333
- I'm afraid to do laundry
because it could hurt my kids.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.066
- Holy shit.

09:01.066 --> 09:04.200
"I'm afraid to do laundry"
is not a great review

09:04.200 --> 09:06.266
of a washing machine.

09:06.266 --> 09:11.233
However it is a fantastic review
of "Jaws 5: Laundry Shark."

09:11.233 --> 09:15.567
The fact is, Samsung is having
a spectacularly bad run of PR,

09:15.567 --> 09:17.233
and to cover themselves
in the future,

09:17.233 --> 09:18.800
they should probably
just come clean

09:18.800 --> 09:21.333
about all their other
products' flaws.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.600
- Hi, we're Samsung.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.900
And we understand
you might be a little nervous

09:25.900 --> 09:27.734
around our products
at the moment.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.800
And we want you to know,
we get it.

09:30.800 --> 09:32.233
We totally get it.

09:32.233 --> 09:35.667
And our promise to you
is no more surprises.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.200
So cards on the table,
here is the truth.

09:38.200 --> 09:41.266
Our phones secretly
call your mom on speakerphone

09:41.266 --> 09:43.166
whenever you're having sex.

09:43.166 --> 09:47.000
Our laptop computers scream in
pain any time you touch them.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.667
Our robot vacuums will
fuck your cat,

09:49.667 --> 09:51.500
and your cat is gonna like it.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.000
Oh, and here's a fun fact.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.967
Our smart TVs firmly believe
that Bill Cosby is innocent.

09:57.967 --> 09:59.333
No shit.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.467
Our fitness watch is
actually fine,

10:01.467 --> 10:04.400
but it does make you look
like a total douche.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.533
And finally, we're just gonna
level with you here.

10:06.533 --> 10:08.934
Our dryers make things wetter.

10:08.934 --> 10:11.467
[laughs]
I mean, we know.

10:11.467 --> 10:14.734
But the one promise
we can absolutely make you

10:14.734 --> 10:18.200
is that none of our products
will explode anymore.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.600
Shit.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.900
Okay, maybe the phones,
I guess.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.967
But definitely not the--
oh, shit.

10:25.967 --> 10:28.533
No, no.
Put the vacuum up.

10:28.533 --> 10:30.533
Put the va--
oh, my God!

10:30.533 --> 10:32.367
Oh, my God.
It's on fire.

10:32.367 --> 10:35.700
The vacuum is on fire.
How is it still moving?

10:35.700 --> 10:38.667
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

10:38.667 --> 10:40.934
Is the watch okay?
Tell me the watch is okay.

10:40.934 --> 10:43.934
You fucking tell me
that watch is okay!

10:43.934 --> 10:46.600
No!
Oh, God.

10:46.600 --> 10:47.934
Fuck me.

10:47.934 --> 10:52.900
The point is, our dryers,
they are fine.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.400
Oh, fuck you.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.967
Ahh!

10:56.967 --> 10:58.133
Samsung.

10:58.133 --> 11:00.834
Hey, at least our logo works,
right?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.467
Oh, come on!

11:03.467 --> 11:05.433
- Moving on.

11:05.433 --> 11:08.066
Tonight, for our main story,

11:08.066 --> 11:10.367
we're going to
look at Obamacare.

11:10.367 --> 11:12.533
Basically the opposite
of this photo,

11:12.533 --> 11:16.200
which is more
"Obama-don't-give-a-fuck."

11:16.200 --> 11:18.400
Two weeks ago,
we devoted around 20 minutes

11:18.400 --> 11:20.767
to Republicans' efforts
to repeal and replace that bill.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.867
And the reason we have to
talk about it again tonight

11:22.867 --> 11:23.867
is this:

11:23.867 --> 11:25.333
- Breaking news overnight.

11:25.333 --> 11:27.233
Republicans reveal
their long-awaited

11:27.233 --> 11:28.900
replacement for Obamacare.

11:28.900 --> 11:31.867
- House Republicans roll out
a revamped health care plan.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.400
- It is finally here.

11:33.400 --> 11:37.633
Oh, yes, the Republican plan
to replace Obamacare is public.

11:37.633 --> 11:41.633
- This is the American
Health Care Act.

11:41.633 --> 11:43.834
- Yes, it's finally here.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.800
The American Health Care Act.

11:45.800 --> 11:46.967
You may not have wanted it.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.900
It looks awful.
But it's here anyway.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.133
Try to think of it
as the legislative equivalent

11:51.133 --> 11:52.633
of "Pirates of the Caribbean 5:

11:52.633 --> 11:56.300
The Curse of Johnny Depp Getting
Divorced and Needing the Money."

11:56.300 --> 11:58.500
And as will be the case
with that movie,

11:58.500 --> 12:01.567
the early reviews of this thing
have been rough.

12:01.567 --> 12:03.000
- This thing is probably
dead on arrival.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.400
- Conservatives hate their bill,
I promise you.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.800
Obamacare lite, dead on arrival.

12:07.800 --> 12:09.033
- It seems dead on arrival.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.266
- It's dead on arrival.

12:10.266 --> 12:12.066
- They're calling it
a stinking pile of garbage.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.166
- Well, that was one--

12:13.166 --> 12:14.867
- They're calling it
dead on arrival.

12:14.867 --> 12:18.467
- Yes, much like the life
behind Melania Trump's eyes,

12:18.467 --> 12:22.900
the AHCA looked dead by the time
it was introduced in Washington.

12:22.900 --> 12:26.233
And there is no doubt,
the bill got enemies quickly.

12:26.233 --> 12:27.667
the American
Medical Association,

12:27.667 --> 12:29.333
the American
Hospital Association,

12:29.333 --> 12:31.867
the American Nurses Association,
and the AARP

12:31.867 --> 12:33.800
all immediately
came out against it.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.133
And even people you'd presume
would be happy about the repeal

12:37.133 --> 12:39.200
were not exactly thrilled.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.500
- Let me show you

12:40.500 --> 12:42.934
what was the front page
of "Breitbart" this morning.

12:42.934 --> 12:47.333
"FreedomWorks Opposes Speaker
Ryan's Obamacare 2.0 Plan."

12:47.333 --> 12:50.033
And I don't think, Selena,
they meant that in a nice way.

12:50.033 --> 12:53.667
- Yeah, I don't think
they do either.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.467
I pretty sure they meant it
in the sense of,

12:55.467 --> 12:58.066
"Ryan is a beta male snowflake
who needs a safe space

12:58.066 --> 13:01.000
for his cuckservative bill"
kind of way.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.500
Essentially, it seems people
on both sides see the AHCA

13:04.500 --> 13:06.367
as just being shitty Obamacare,

13:06.367 --> 13:09.800
the way Old Navy is
a shitty version of The Gap,

13:09.800 --> 13:11.934
and the way Easter,
let's be honest,

13:11.934 --> 13:14.900
should really just be called
Shitty Christmas.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.867
Only one month till
Shitty Christmas, everyone!

13:17.867 --> 13:19.233
What are you asking for?

13:19.233 --> 13:20.867
It had better be
a basket full of beans,

13:20.867 --> 13:23.567
'cause that's
what you're getting!

13:23.567 --> 13:24.800
But--but here is the thing.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.767
This bill is not
actually dead on arrival.

13:27.767 --> 13:30.066
There is still a chance
it could become law.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.400
So given that,
we need to take a look

13:32.400 --> 13:34.633
at what is actually inside
this thing.

13:34.633 --> 13:36.934
And let's start
with one of the big changes.

13:36.934 --> 13:38.033
As we anticipated,

13:38.033 --> 13:40.900
it gets rid of Obamacare's
insurance tax credits,

13:40.900 --> 13:43.367
which are based on many factors,
including income,

13:43.367 --> 13:47.233
and they've replaced that with
a flat tax credit based on age.

13:47.233 --> 13:48.934
Here is how it works.

13:48.934 --> 13:50.533
- The proposal provides
tax credits

13:50.533 --> 13:52.266
to help pay for premiums.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.867
Someone under the age of 30
would get $2,000.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.700
Someone 60 and older
would get $4,000.

13:57.700 --> 14:00.934
- Okay, so the older you get,
the more money you get.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.200
That's easy to understand.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.767
Think of it
as the exact opposite

14:03.767 --> 14:05.600
of being a woman in Hollywood.

14:05.600 --> 14:09.200
Now--now,
as we discussed two weeks ago,

14:09.200 --> 14:12.700
the key question here is,
do the size of those credits

14:12.700 --> 14:15.734
sufficiently cover the actual
cost of health insurance,

14:15.734 --> 14:18.533
or are you left, like
a middle-aged man in a thong,

14:18.533 --> 14:20.333
horrifically under-covered?

14:20.333 --> 14:21.867
And to help answer
that question--

14:21.867 --> 14:23.967
I'm sorry.
Can we just take that down?

14:23.967 --> 14:25.567
Thank you.
That's much better.

14:25.567 --> 14:28.400
To help answer that question,

14:28.400 --> 14:31.166
the Kaiser Family Foundation
made a tool

14:31.166 --> 14:33.834
showing how you might be
impacted by this new bill,

14:33.834 --> 14:35.734
based on your age,
income, and location.

14:35.734 --> 14:37.967
It's like
a choose-your-own adventure game

14:37.967 --> 14:40.433
for a very specific
type of child.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.333
If your kid likes "Caillou,"

14:42.333 --> 14:45.100
he will love this interactive
map of tax credits

14:45.100 --> 14:47.100
from the Kaiser
Family Foundation.

14:47.100 --> 14:50.233
So let's say you live
in Woodward County, Oklahoma,

14:50.233 --> 14:54.033
you're 60 years old, and
you earn, say, $50,000 a year.

14:54.033 --> 14:58.967
Under Obamacare, you'd get
$13,350 towards insurance.

14:58.967 --> 15:00.066
But under the new bill,

15:00.066 --> 15:03.300
that will drop down
to just $4,000.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.633
That is over 2/3 less.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.767
And it's not one of those
2/3 decreases

15:07.767 --> 15:08.867
that you barely notice,

15:08.867 --> 15:11.500
like when Robin and Barry
of the Bee Gees died.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.700
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.600
Barry is fine.
Robin and Maurice are dead.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.200
Or are they?
Or are they?

15:18.200 --> 15:19.633
The point is: they are.

15:19.633 --> 15:20.500
Although, to be fair,

15:20.500 --> 15:22.467
I have no idea.
You don't either.

15:22.467 --> 15:25.600
And I don't see either one of us
Googling it anytime soon.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.633
But that is really
just one example.

15:28.633 --> 15:31.266
There are a lot of people
who would be harmed

15:31.266 --> 15:33.233
by the switch
to these flat tax credits,

15:33.233 --> 15:36.200
and experts say one thing
is pretty clear here.

15:36.200 --> 15:40.000
Those who are lower-income
would be particularly hurt.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.533
And that is before
we even get into Medicaid,

15:42.533 --> 15:44.467
the program that largely
provides healthcare

15:44.467 --> 15:45.767
to poor and disabled Americans,

15:45.767 --> 15:49.567
because that is where
this bill gets really vicious.

15:49.567 --> 15:52.133
And you know the changes
to Medicaid are rough

15:52.133 --> 15:54.266
just from how
creepily enthusiastic

15:54.266 --> 15:56.533
Paul Ryan sounds talking
about them.

16:15.533 --> 16:19.100
- He is rock hard
talking about that.

16:19.100 --> 16:23.200
Somehow, you can actually hear
his erection during that.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.066
And if you don't know
what he's talking about,

16:25.066 --> 16:27.233
that just sounds
like a benign pile of words.

16:27.233 --> 16:29.500
But when he says
"defederalizing,"

16:29.500 --> 16:30.867
"block granting," and "capping,"

16:30.867 --> 16:32.834
what that means
in layman's terms

16:32.834 --> 16:36.200
is cutting the living shit
out of Medicaid.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.500
According to one analysis,

16:37.500 --> 16:40.700
the plan would cut
at least $370 billion

16:40.700 --> 16:43.467
in federal funding for Medicaid
over the next ten years.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.900
Now what that means
is that states would have to

16:45.900 --> 16:49.600
make up that gap to maintain
current levels of coverage.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.166
Which, for many of them,
will be next to impossible.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.600
So when they don't,

16:53.600 --> 16:56.633
millions of the poorest
Americans will lose coverage.

16:56.633 --> 16:57.900
Millions.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.300
And I literally just heard
Ryan getting another erection

17:01.300 --> 17:03.567
when I said those words.

17:03.567 --> 17:06.133
And when you combine that with
the insufficient tax credits,

17:06.133 --> 17:08.900
an estimated
6 to 15 million people

17:08.900 --> 17:10.633
are projected to lose insurance.

17:10.633 --> 17:12.967
But to hear Republicans
like Jason Chaffetz tell it,

17:12.967 --> 17:15.367
there's an easy solution.

17:15.367 --> 17:17.000
- You know what?
Americans have choices.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.300
And they've got to
make a choice.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.700
And so maybe rather than
getting that new iPhone

17:20.700 --> 17:22.033
that they just love

17:22.033 --> 17:23.433
and they want to go spend
hundreds of dollars on that,

17:23.433 --> 17:25.166
maybe they should invest
in their own health care.

17:25.166 --> 17:28.333
- That is complete bullshit.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.200
And it's frankly a little hard
to take a lecture

17:30.200 --> 17:32.066
on making good choices
from a man

17:32.066 --> 17:34.400
who presumably entered
a barbershop and said,

17:34.400 --> 17:37.934
"Give me the wet poodle pubes.

17:37.934 --> 17:41.600
Make it look
like this photo I took."

17:41.600 --> 17:45.233
The truth is, if insurance
cost as much as an iPhone,

17:45.233 --> 17:47.300
we wouldn't even be
having this debate.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.834
People are going to be hurt
by this bill,

17:49.834 --> 17:51.200
and those hit the hardest,

17:51.200 --> 17:54.400
who stand to lose $5,000 or more
under the new plan,

17:54.400 --> 17:57.600
are, ironically,
a group that voted for Trump

17:57.600 --> 18:01.400
by a huge margin,
which is pretty frustrating.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.500
It's like if the people of
Pompeii voted for the volcano.

18:05.500 --> 18:08.300
Oh, I know you get to define
your own self-interest,

18:08.300 --> 18:12.300
but I wish you hadn't voted
for that volcano.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.567
So, look, if this bill
is bad for older Americans,

18:15.567 --> 18:17.767
poor Americans,
and many Trump supporters,

18:17.767 --> 18:19.834
and all these groups oppose it,

18:19.834 --> 18:22.834
who exactly is it for?

18:22.834 --> 18:25.734
- Wealthy Americans are set
to get a sizable tax break

18:25.734 --> 18:27.567
under the GOP's
health care bill,

18:27.567 --> 18:31.467
and the ultra wealthy will see
an even bigger tax cut.

18:31.467 --> 18:33.467
Some of those
in the top 1% of incomes

18:33.467 --> 18:36.300
will get a tax break
of around $33,000.

18:36.300 --> 18:37.700
- Wow.
Phew.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.300
- Those in the top 0.1%
will get an average tax cut

18:40.300 --> 18:45.266
of about $197,000
under the GOP plan.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.867
- Wow indeed.

18:47.867 --> 18:51.400
So this plan is literally
taking money from the poor

18:51.400 --> 18:53.100
and giving it to the very rich.

18:53.100 --> 18:56.066
It's essentially
a "Reverse Bernie Sanders,"

18:56.066 --> 18:58.233
which is actually
also the name of a sex act

18:58.233 --> 19:01.300
consisting of very
aggressive fingering.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.333
[laughter and applause]

19:07.200 --> 19:10.667
And--and it's not just liberals
uncomfortable with this idea.

19:10.667 --> 19:12.533
This week,
Paul Ryan paid a visit to

19:12.533 --> 19:14.667
"Tucker Carlson's
Second Second-Chance Attempt

19:14.667 --> 19:17.266
At His Own TV News Show
With Tucker Carlson"

19:17.266 --> 19:19.800
and found himself
under attack.

19:19.800 --> 19:20.967
- Kind of a hard sell
to say,

19:20.967 --> 19:22.500
"Yeah, we're gonna
repeal Obamacare

19:22.500 --> 19:24.367
"but we're gonna send more money
to the people

19:24.367 --> 19:26.200
who've already gotten the
richest over the last 10 years."

19:26.200 --> 19:27.600
I mean,
that's what this does, no?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.500
I'm not leftist.
It's just--that's true!

19:29.500 --> 19:32.433
- "I'm not leftist.
That's true."

19:32.433 --> 19:34.300
Ryan's plan is so harsh,

19:34.300 --> 19:39.166
it just caused a 47-year-old
boy-man in a bowtie named Tucker

19:39.166 --> 19:42.567
to worry about seeming
overly sympathetic to the poor.

19:42.567 --> 19:43.900
And before you point out

19:43.900 --> 19:46.967
that Tucker Carlson isn't
wearing a bowtie, he is.

19:46.967 --> 19:49.400
Just not where you can see it.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.400
And--and it is
not just Tucker here.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.033
Many Republican governors
and members of Congress

19:55.033 --> 19:56.400
have expressed real concern

19:56.400 --> 19:58.800
that this bill is going to
actively hurt their states.

19:58.800 --> 20:01.100
While on the other hand,
amazingly,

20:01.100 --> 20:02.900
those on the far
right wing of the party,

20:02.900 --> 20:05.100
like Congressman
Mo Brooks of Alabama,

20:05.100 --> 20:07.500
think it's way too generous.

20:07.500 --> 20:09.300
- This far and away
is the biggest

20:09.300 --> 20:11.834
welfare program
ever sponsored,

20:11.834 --> 20:14.367
and quite frankly
it undermines the work ethic.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.433
It increases
greater reliance on welfare

20:16.433 --> 20:17.567
from the federal
government.

20:17.567 --> 20:19.033
Ultimately,
it's gonna result

20:19.033 --> 20:20.166
in the demise
of our country

20:20.166 --> 20:21.433
or at least contribute

20:21.433 --> 20:24.233
to our debilitating
insolvency and bankruptcy.

20:24.233 --> 20:28.767
- So this bill seems almost
universally hated in Washington.

20:28.767 --> 20:32.900
It is truly the Ted Cruz
of health care legislation.

20:32.900 --> 20:34.900
Fuck you, Ted.

20:34.900 --> 20:38.300
Fuck you.
From everybody.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.400
[cheers and applause]

20:39.400 --> 20:42.033
So--so the White House
clearly has

20:42.033 --> 20:43.500
a tough sales job ahead,

20:43.500 --> 20:45.734
and their efforts so far
have been less than impressive.

20:45.734 --> 20:47.633
Just watch White House
press secretary

20:47.633 --> 20:50.367
and breakout star of
"Bridesmaids," Melissa McCarthy,

20:50.367 --> 20:53.200
deploy some visual aids.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.166
- For all the people
who have concerns about this,

20:55.166 --> 20:57.934
especially on the right,
look at the size.

20:57.934 --> 21:01.000
This is the Democrats.
This is us.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.100
There is--

21:02.100 --> 21:04.400
I mean,
you can't get any clearer

21:04.400 --> 21:07.166
in terms of "this is government,
this is not."

21:07.166 --> 21:10.133
- First,
she's a national treasure.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.667
But--but second,

21:11.667 --> 21:14.800
that is the most aggressively
stupid thing I've ever seen.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.367
And I just saw
Jason Chaffetz suggest

21:17.367 --> 21:18.600
paying for health insurance

21:18.600 --> 21:21.834
by retroactively
not buying an iPhone.

21:21.834 --> 21:25.066
And that low page count starts
to get actively worrisome

21:25.066 --> 21:26.400
when you find out
what they spent

21:26.400 --> 21:29.000
a decent amount of time in there
focusing on.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.800
- The Republican plan contains
a section devoted to making sure

21:31.800 --> 21:34.233
people receiving government
health care assistance

21:34.233 --> 21:36.300
who win the lottery are removed
from the program

21:36.300 --> 21:37.934
in an orderly fashion.

21:37.934 --> 21:41.533
In fact, six pages of this bill
is devoted

21:41.533 --> 21:43.367
to letting states dis-enroll

21:43.367 --> 21:44.934
high-dollar lottery winners.

21:44.934 --> 21:49.200
- Okay, so a not-insignificant
percentage of this bill

21:49.200 --> 21:51.033
is focused on
the urgent matter of,

21:51.033 --> 21:55.166
"What if one poor person
suddenly becomes less poor?"

21:55.166 --> 21:57.233
I'm honestly surprised
they didn't also

21:57.233 --> 21:58.633
have a section covering
what would happen

21:58.633 --> 22:01.667
in the event of
a Freaky Friday-type situation.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.166
"If the Medicaid recipient
Freaky-Fridays into the body

22:04.166 --> 22:06.633
"of an individual
living above 138%

22:06.633 --> 22:07.800
"of the federal poverty line,

22:07.800 --> 22:10.233
"states are obligated
to de-enroll recipient

22:10.233 --> 22:13.333
"until recipient
Freaky-Fridays back,

22:13.333 --> 22:16.266
"using wish or magic
not otherwise specified,

22:16.266 --> 22:19.867
or Freaky-Fridays
into an eligible body."

22:19.867 --> 22:24.467
And yet--and yet,
despite all of this,

22:24.467 --> 22:26.767
Republican leaders are
ferociously trying

22:26.767 --> 22:28.200
to jam this bill through.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.467
Already, it had been
introduced in the House

22:30.467 --> 22:32.166
and passed by two committees.

22:32.166 --> 22:34.133
And yet there is one person,
though,

22:34.133 --> 22:37.367
you may've noticed I haven't
actually mentioned so far.

22:37.367 --> 22:38.767
And that is Donald Trump.

22:38.767 --> 22:41.166
And the reason he's been
largely absent from our story

22:41.166 --> 22:44.600
is that he's been largely absent
from this story in general.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.700
Because putting aside
the prop comedy

22:46.700 --> 22:48.734
of the star of "Mike & Molly,"

22:48.734 --> 22:52.433
the White House has been
pretty hands-off with this bill.

22:52.433 --> 22:55.200
And is there really any way,
deep down,

22:55.200 --> 22:57.934
that Trump has actually read
this thing,

22:57.934 --> 23:00.433
given that
he recently said this?

23:00.433 --> 23:02.033
- We have come up
with a solution

23:02.033 --> 23:06.066
that's really, really,
I think, very good.

23:06.066 --> 23:07.100
Now I have to tell you:

23:07.100 --> 23:09.700
it's an unbelievably
complex subject.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.100
Nobody knew that health care

23:11.100 --> 23:12.734
could be so complicated.

23:12.734 --> 23:14.834
- Everybody knew that.

23:14.834 --> 23:18.834
Everybody knew
health care is complicated.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.467
Literally everybody.

23:20.467 --> 23:23.533
It's the one thing people know
about health care.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.467
It's complicated.

23:25.467 --> 23:28.300
It's like you're saying,
"Who knew King Tut was dead?"

23:28.300 --> 23:30.400
Everybody did.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.400
He's as dead as Barry,
Maurice, or Robin Gibb.

23:33.400 --> 23:35.100
Or all of them or none of them.

23:35.100 --> 23:38.033
There's no way to find out.

23:38.033 --> 23:41.633
Trump has been noticeably
distant from this whole process,

23:41.633 --> 23:43.600
and perhaps nothing
shows that more

23:43.600 --> 23:46.000
than how this bill
is being branded.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.867
- Is it by any other name,
Trumpcare?

23:48.867 --> 23:51.000
- I'll call it--
I'll call it Trumpcare

23:51.000 --> 23:52.300
if you want to, but I don't--

23:52.300 --> 23:54.400
I didn't hear President Trump
say to any of us,

23:54.400 --> 23:56.000
"Hey, I want my name on that."

23:56.000 --> 23:58.133
- Holy shit.

23:58.133 --> 24:01.333
Trump is not clamoring
to put his name on this bill,

24:01.333 --> 24:02.467
and he has put his name

24:02.467 --> 24:05.900
on some of the shittiest
products in human history.

24:05.900 --> 24:09.233
He put his name on a vodka,
even though he doesn't drink,

24:09.233 --> 24:11.800
whose slogan was
"Success Distilled,"

24:11.800 --> 24:13.500
which was discontinued.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.333
He put his name on Trump Ties,

24:15.333 --> 24:17.133
which look like
the answer to the question:

24:17.133 --> 24:18.900
"If erectile dysfunction
was a fabric,

24:18.900 --> 24:21.033
what fabric would it be?"

24:21.033 --> 24:23.500
He even slapped
his first and last names

24:23.500 --> 24:26.066
on Donald Trump Jr.,
a man who looks

24:26.066 --> 24:30.000
like a six-year-old's drawing
of a mean bank teller.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.367
Trump not wanting his name
on the health care bill

24:33.367 --> 24:36.200
is like Tyler Perry not wanting
his name anywhere near

24:36.200 --> 24:39.333
"Jew! A Madea Hanukkah."

24:39.333 --> 24:41.233
But--but you know what?

24:41.233 --> 24:45.433
I-I can kind of understand Trump
not wanting his name on this.

24:45.433 --> 24:47.633
It contains
almost nothing that he promised,

24:47.633 --> 24:49.333
as Laura Ingraham
pointed out this week

24:49.333 --> 24:51.033
on "Fox & Friends."

24:51.033 --> 24:53.834
- The Trumpism of
the health care reform,

24:53.834 --> 24:55.867
the Trumpiest parts of it,

24:55.867 --> 24:58.633
were transparency in pricing,

24:58.633 --> 25:02.066
competition across state lines,
and even on the edges,

25:02.066 --> 25:04.567
you know, repealing
the McCarran-Ferguson Act.

25:04.567 --> 25:06.066
Where is that in this plan?

25:06.066 --> 25:08.734
- Oh, I'll tell you.
It's not in there.

25:08.734 --> 25:10.900
He is pushing a health care bill
that is missing

25:10.900 --> 25:12.400
a lot of what he said he wanted.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.100
And that is the kind
of top-shelf deal-making

25:15.100 --> 25:17.800
that you can read all about
in his bestselling book,

25:17.800 --> 25:20.667
"The Art of the...Wait, What
Was the Deal I Wanted Again?

25:20.667 --> 25:21.934
"Oh, I Forget.

25:21.934 --> 25:23.834
"Well, Anyway, Let's Talk About
How Hot My Daughter Is.

25:23.834 --> 25:27.300
Right, Fellas?
Va-Va-Voom!"

25:27.300 --> 25:31.233
And Trump--Trump clearly
noticed that criticism.

25:31.233 --> 25:33.633
Because shortly after
the segment aired, he tweeted,

25:33.633 --> 25:36.300
"Don't worry.
Getting rid of state lines,

25:36.300 --> 25:37.867
"which will promote competition,

25:37.867 --> 25:41.033
will be in phase 2 & 3
of healthcare rollout."

25:41.033 --> 25:43.767
And then, as if to eliminate
any doubt

25:43.767 --> 25:45.500
as to whether he was watching
"Fox & Friends"

25:45.500 --> 25:49.233
he ended the tweet,
"@foxandfriends."

25:49.233 --> 25:50.467
And by the way, just--

25:50.467 --> 25:53.100
just about that "buying
across state lines" business,

25:53.100 --> 25:55.033
Trump and Ryan keep promising

25:55.033 --> 25:56.667
that it's just
around the corner.

25:56.667 --> 25:57.767
But two things you should know.

25:57.767 --> 25:59.967
One,
it probably won't lower prices.

25:59.967 --> 26:02.600
In fact, these three states
currently allow it,

26:02.600 --> 26:05.533
but not a single
out-of-state-insurer

26:05.533 --> 26:08.133
has taken them up on the offer,
which does actually make sense.

26:08.133 --> 26:10.700
'Cause if you're an insurer
in Massachusetts,

26:10.700 --> 26:13.233
it takes a massive amount
of time and investment

26:13.233 --> 26:17.100
to set up new networks of
doctors and hospitals in Maine,

26:17.100 --> 26:19.133
and that's assuming
Maine even has doctors.

26:19.133 --> 26:21.934
I think it's mainly beavers
with stethoscopes up there.

26:21.934 --> 26:24.533
So this--this state line thing

26:24.533 --> 26:26.800
is something people love
to talk about in theory

26:26.800 --> 26:29.000
but no one really wants to do
in practice,

26:29.000 --> 26:30.333
like apple picking

26:30.333 --> 26:32.133
or shower sex.

26:32.133 --> 26:35.600
But--but
the even bigger issue is,

26:35.600 --> 26:38.066
it's almost certainly
not going to happen.

26:38.066 --> 26:39.500
The state-lines bullshit

26:39.500 --> 26:41.934
and a lot of other things
Trump has promised

26:41.934 --> 26:45.467
are not in this bill
because they cannot be,

26:45.467 --> 26:47.934
as Paul Ryan well knows.

26:47.934 --> 26:49.500
- Inter-state shopping
across state lines.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.800
We love that policy,
we think it's critical,

26:51.800 --> 26:54.367
But as you well know,
you cannot put that

26:54.367 --> 26:55.533
in a budget
reconciliation bill.

26:55.533 --> 26:56.934
Otherwise it could be
filibustered.

26:56.934 --> 26:58.700
- Exactly.
He is right.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.100
For procedural reasons,

27:00.100 --> 27:02.467
this is being presented
as a budget bill,

27:02.467 --> 27:05.567
which Republicans can pass
with a simple Senate majority.

27:05.567 --> 27:08.600
Any non-budget-related
policy change

27:08.600 --> 27:11.567
requires 60 votes
to beat a filibuster.

27:11.567 --> 27:13.367
So that is pretty much
a dead end.

27:13.367 --> 27:16.500
Meaning that this bill
is, in all likelihood,

27:16.500 --> 27:19.433
all Trump can get passed
to replace Obamacare.

27:19.433 --> 27:21.367
So it is fucking important

27:21.367 --> 27:23.633
everyone understands
what is in it,

27:23.633 --> 27:26.233
and that the "something
terrific" that he promised--

27:26.233 --> 27:28.166
better coverage, lower costs,

27:28.166 --> 27:29.834
no one losing
their health insurance--

27:29.834 --> 27:32.300
well, this bill is not it.

27:32.300 --> 27:35.567
The bill Trump is championing
will actually increase costs

27:35.567 --> 27:37.166
for older, poorer Americans,

27:37.166 --> 27:40.333
and will cause millions
of people to lose coverage.

27:40.333 --> 27:42.934
Somebody needs
to explain this to him.

27:42.934 --> 27:46.000
And since he is clearly
still watching "Fox & Friends,"

27:46.000 --> 27:49.400
we might actually
be able to help here.

27:49.400 --> 27:51.834
'Cause you might remember,
last month,

27:51.834 --> 27:53.266
we bought time on that show

27:53.266 --> 27:55.867
to have our catheter cowboy
explain to him

27:55.867 --> 27:57.600
what the nuclear triad is.

27:57.600 --> 28:01.967
Well, saddle up, partner,
for tonight, you ride again!

28:01.967 --> 28:03.900
[cheers and applause]

28:03.900 --> 28:05.333
Because think about it.

28:05.333 --> 28:08.667
Who better to tell Trump
what this bill will do

28:08.667 --> 28:10.700
than someone who stands
to be hurt by it?

28:10.700 --> 28:13.767
Someone in his 60s
in rural America

28:13.767 --> 28:15.767
with an unspecified
medical problem

28:15.767 --> 28:17.633
that requires
constant treatment?

28:17.633 --> 28:21.166
Please enjoy this ad, which will
air on "Fox & Friends"

28:21.166 --> 28:23.967
in the D.C. area
on Wednesday morning.

28:25.467 --> 28:26.500
- Hi, me again.

28:26.500 --> 28:29.233
I'm a professional cowboy
and I use catheters.

28:29.233 --> 28:32.967
Been cowboyin' for 25 years
and there's two things I know.

28:32.967 --> 28:35.266
I don't like pain when I cath

28:35.266 --> 28:37.500
and health care
is a complicated business.

28:37.500 --> 28:40.233
Everybody knows that--
literally everybody.

28:40.233 --> 28:43.400
Also, if my premiums go up
and subsidies go down,

28:43.400 --> 28:45.467
I'm going to wind up
paying more.

28:45.467 --> 28:47.166
That's basic math there, fella.

28:47.166 --> 28:50.467
That's like replacing
my catheter with a garden hose.

28:50.467 --> 28:51.767
I don't want that.

28:51.767 --> 28:54.400
I do not like pain when I cath.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.100
The point is,
if that happens,

28:56.100 --> 28:59.166
millions of folks like me
might get real angry,

28:59.166 --> 29:01.800
which is worth thinking about
if you're the sort of person

29:01.800 --> 29:04.033
who really likes being popular.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.367
You get that, right?

29:06.367 --> 29:07.567
Right?

29:09.567 --> 29:11.200
You get that.

29:13.333 --> 29:14.433
Right?

29:17.266 --> 29:18.600
Right?

29:22.233 --> 29:24.033
You get that, right?

29:24.033 --> 29:25.400
[laughter]

29:25.400 --> 29:27.533
- That's our show!
Thank you so much for watching.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.000
See you next week.
Good night.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.367
- How is that fucking moving?

29:31.367 --> 29:33.867
Why is it not dead?
It's on fire!

29:33.867 --> 29:36.200
That's fucked up right there.
Is it me?

29:36.200 --> 29:37.800
Or is that fucked up?

29:37.800 --> 29:39.633
Whoa, shit!

29:39.633 --> 29:41.266
Fuck this whole thing.

29:41.266 --> 29:43.800
We are grossly irresponsible.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.734
It's coming right at me.
Oh, fuck this.

29:46.734 --> 29:48.033
I'm not even--

29:48.033 --> 29:49.800
I can't even believe
I agreed to do this.

29:49.800 --> 29:51.867
You guys suck.

29:51.867 --> 29:53.934
[bright tone]
