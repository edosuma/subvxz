O'Brien: <i>A cloud of suspicion
hangs over this administration.</i>

00:15.251 --> 00:18.286
Were there cover-ups?
Lies?

00:18.353 --> 00:20.287
Selina: Oh, God.
I hate impeachments.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.656
They're so '90s.

00:21.690 --> 00:23.057
Well, the president
now has the Senate

00:23.092 --> 00:25.693
and the House after him.
Gonna rain pain.

00:25.727 --> 00:28.162
So what's POTUS's
next move, Jonah?

00:28.196 --> 00:29.662
Oh, these lips are on lockdown.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.698
Right.
You don't know.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.866
No, I just have a "don't ask
don't tell" policy

00:33.900 --> 00:35.334
about the things that I know.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.668
Or that I don't know.

00:36.735 --> 00:39.437
Jonah, don't talk, don't stay.

00:39.471 --> 00:41.438
You need to fuck off
and go back to Westworld.

00:41.472 --> 00:42.539
- But, ma'am--
- You need to fuck off.

00:42.573 --> 00:43.974
- <i>But, ma'am--</i>
- I said fuck off.

00:44.008 --> 00:46.008
- Three fucks, you're out.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:46.043 --> 00:49.511
Yeah. Uh, guys, everybody
in my office, please.

00:50.980 --> 00:54.116
Um, Gary, why don't you
come sit here next to me?

00:54.183 --> 00:55.818
Okay.

01:00.725 --> 01:02.325
I've already told Amy this,

01:02.359 --> 01:05.028
but I have something
that I need to tell you all.

01:05.062 --> 01:06.797
I think I know
what you're gonna say.

01:08.099 --> 01:10.634
I've decided I'm not
going to join POTUS

01:10.668 --> 01:14.472
in the next election.
I'm gonna get out.

01:14.506 --> 01:16.040
Yeah.

01:18.911 --> 01:22.079
Ma'am, you have my deepest,
deepest sympathies.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.814
Okay, well, I'm not dead.

01:24.849 --> 01:27.817
( chuckles ) My plan is

01:27.851 --> 01:30.386
that I'm gonna leave
in two years,

01:30.421 --> 01:33.156
but then I'm gonna
run for president

01:33.190 --> 01:34.758
four years after that.

01:34.792 --> 01:38.528
But in the meantime, I obviously
can't keep everybody on.

01:38.563 --> 01:39.730
No, it's okay.

01:39.764 --> 01:43.167
So if you need
to look for other jobs,

01:43.201 --> 01:44.802
then you need
to be thinking about that.

01:44.836 --> 01:46.771
No one's thinking about that
right now, ma'am.

01:46.805 --> 01:47.972
Furthest thing from our minds.

01:48.006 --> 01:49.574
I'm still digesting
the information.

01:49.608 --> 01:51.242
Although I should
really take this call.

01:51.276 --> 01:52.376
- Yeah?
- Selina: <i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:52.411 --> 01:53.811
Well, your devotion
to this job...

01:53.845 --> 01:55.813
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- <i>...it's just inspiring, Dan.</i>

01:55.847 --> 01:57.681
He's not getting a call.
He's making a call, right?

01:57.749 --> 01:59.717
Hi. Yes.

01:59.751 --> 02:02.019
Can you please
tell Governor Chung

02:02.054 --> 02:05.055
that Dan Egan is ready
for the Chung chat?

02:05.090 --> 02:08.626
- ( phone chimes )
- Hi, Senator McKensie. How are you?

02:08.660 --> 02:11.429
You really think she'll go?

02:11.463 --> 02:13.097
God, that's such a shame.

02:13.131 --> 02:16.167
No, it means I have
absolutely nothing to do.

02:16.201 --> 02:17.402
I meant for her.

02:17.436 --> 02:18.870
Still, this might mean

02:18.904 --> 02:21.673
that we could spend
more time together.

02:21.707 --> 02:23.875
Let's take it
one day at a time.

02:23.909 --> 02:26.444
Sweet Jesus.
( chuckles )

02:26.479 --> 02:29.114
Thank you so much for seeing me at
such short notice, Mr. Davison.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.516
Happy to, Miss Wilson.

02:30.550 --> 02:33.753
I'm an ardent admirer of your
efficiency and precision.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.488
Oh, well, in that case,
let's get right to it.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.423
Excellent.
I respect your brevity.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.991
It's almost threatening.

02:39.059 --> 02:41.026
Yes, Congressman Kosynski.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.962
Or should I say
mentor Kosynski?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.431
Yes, sir. Well, I always
thought of you as a mentor.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.834
The father figure my own dad was
too weird and distant to be.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.771
Like that night that you stayed over and
we read the papers the next morning?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.939
- Uh-huh.
- That was really nice.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.342
And I thought, yeah,
that is something

02:56.376 --> 02:58.310
that I could do
for the rest of my life.

02:58.344 --> 03:00.111
Yeah, well, you know,
I like sleep and newspapers

03:00.146 --> 03:02.247
- as much as the next person, but...
- <i>Right.</i>

03:02.281 --> 03:03.314
the rest of your life?

03:03.349 --> 03:05.049
You know, you're gonna
get bedsores.

03:05.084 --> 03:07.752
I would have no problem
finding you a position

03:07.786 --> 03:10.488
within my Dream Metric team.
Sound good?

03:10.522 --> 03:12.990
- Yes, sir.
- We are simpatico.

03:13.025 --> 03:15.266
- We have a deal.
- Pleasure doing business with you, sir.

03:15.293 --> 03:17.794
Yes, yes. Justice
Blackwell, how are you?

03:17.829 --> 03:19.796
Thank you so much
for calling me back.

03:19.830 --> 03:22.432
- You fast?
- Oh, yeah.

03:22.466 --> 03:24.234
They call me
the Washington Flash.

03:24.268 --> 03:25.802
( laughs ) I doubt that.

03:25.836 --> 03:27.504
All right, let's get
this over with ASAP.

03:27.538 --> 03:29.205
It's not gonna be easy
with this big, gangly

03:29.240 --> 03:30.974
piss flap over here
who moves like--

03:31.008 --> 03:32.675
hey, what do you
move like, Will?

03:32.710 --> 03:35.245
I move as slowly
as a Mississippi detective

03:35.312 --> 03:37.313
investigating the murder
of a young black man.

03:37.348 --> 03:38.582
That's right.
Ready, Mike?

03:38.616 --> 03:41.218
Yeah, abso-- oh.
Right behind you.

03:42.487 --> 03:43.587
Hey, ma'am, you know
you're gonna break

03:43.621 --> 03:45.455
the president's heart
with this news.

03:45.490 --> 03:46.990
Wish I could break his spine.

03:47.058 --> 03:49.626
But I can't, 'cause
it's made of Jell-O.

03:49.660 --> 03:52.896
Come on, you being veep is the best
thing that's ever happened to America.

03:52.930 --> 03:55.265
Gary, it has been shit.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.968
- No, it hasn't.
- It has. I'm getting out.

03:58.002 --> 04:00.637
- Oh, Madam Vice President.
- What did I tell you earlier?

04:00.672 --> 04:02.472
- Again?
- Yeah.

04:02.507 --> 04:04.708
Excuse me, Ben.
Gonna go see the president.

04:04.743 --> 04:06.911
Uh, no. No, you're not.
He's canceled.

04:06.945 --> 04:08.879
And you're gonna
meet with me instead.

04:08.913 --> 04:11.648
Ma'am, that is what I was going
to tell you earlier today

04:11.683 --> 04:13.417
- until you told me to--
- Fuck off.

04:13.451 --> 04:16.187
Are you finishing my sentence or
are you telling me that again?

04:16.255 --> 04:17.688
Both.

04:17.723 --> 04:19.390
Yes, ma'am.

04:19.423 --> 04:22.526
Good.
Go ahead.

04:22.560 --> 04:24.728
Congressman...
( laughs )

04:24.762 --> 04:26.964
Wow, you're fast.

04:26.998 --> 04:29.399
Just wondering if you
could use a top press guy.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.635
Ha! I really don't have
any need for you, Mike.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.170
You're kind of obsolete.

04:33.205 --> 04:35.406
You're like a Viking
stuck in time.

04:35.441 --> 04:38.577
- I have excellent contacts.
- Really?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.612
Very high up people, sir.
Very high up.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.882
Maybe you can hook me up
with Charlize Theron.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.250
Funny, but I'm being
serious, sir.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.786
No, I'm being serious, too.
I'd like to fuck her.

04:46.820 --> 04:49.723
Why'd you leave anyway? You get stuck
with your dick in the veep's decaf?

04:49.757 --> 04:53.192
No, we just all need
new challenges.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.928
We? What, is the whole
team leaving?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.696
- No, no. No, sir.
- Holy shit.

04:56.730 --> 04:59.298
- She's leaving the ticket.
- No, absolutely not.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.934
We had a fucking deal.
I make Senate in two years,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.736
we run together
as a team in six.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.172
- That was the deal.
- Why don't you fucking kill yourself, Will?

05:06.206 --> 05:09.108
Let me be clear, sir. She may
be planning to run in six years

05:09.142 --> 05:10.609
if she was leaving the ticket,

05:10.644 --> 05:13.345
which I have not
actually said she will.

05:13.379 --> 05:16.315
Oh, fucking God,
thank you for stopping.

05:16.383 --> 05:18.084
You know what?
If I didn't already know

05:18.118 --> 05:20.553
how shitty you are at your
job, you just proved it.

05:20.587 --> 05:23.590
I have some
very big news, ma'am.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.492
Well, I have huge news.

05:25.526 --> 05:29.228
In fact, I guarantee you that
my news is front-page news.

05:29.263 --> 05:31.797
Your news is probably
more like a page six,

05:31.832 --> 05:33.832
Kardashian crap news.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.335
POTUS knows how this
is all going to end,

05:36.370 --> 05:39.705
so he drank
the poisoned Kool-Aid

05:39.740 --> 05:41.808
from my very big, blue mug.

05:41.842 --> 05:45.077
- Huh?
- He isn't going to run again in two years.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.616
Are you serious?

05:49.650 --> 05:51.584
No, I'm Joan fucking Rivers.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.186
Of course I'm serious.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.756
Once the party leadership
figures out he's not gonna run,

05:56.791 --> 05:59.726
then all the impeachment bullshit
is just gonna fade away.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.327
So, um--

06:01.362 --> 06:04.231
so why didn't he tell me this?
Why are you telling me this?

06:04.265 --> 06:07.267
Because he couldn't stomach
the look-- like that,

06:07.301 --> 06:09.335
just like that--
of unbridled joy.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.371
Ben, I am crying

06:11.405 --> 06:14.174
very quietly on the inside.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.843
While in your mind you're doing
pirouettes on his grave.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.745
Oh, don't tell me you're
not happy about this.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.146
You're finally
getting out of here.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.582
Well, it's not the job
that's depressing.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.483
Life is depressing.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.387
Let's go.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.690
No, I've got it.
I can do this.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.059
I'm fine.

06:35.094 --> 06:36.527
( suppressed squeal )

06:36.595 --> 06:38.095
( quietly ) Yes!

06:38.130 --> 06:40.597
Fuck! Gosh!

06:42.634 --> 06:44.368
Ahem.

06:46.170 --> 06:47.704
Hi, Sue.

06:47.738 --> 06:50.218
We'd like to see the vice president
as a matter of some urgency.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.175
- No.
- Fuck this, I'm going in the side door.

06:52.209 --> 06:53.877
You do and Secret Service
might break your neck.

06:53.911 --> 06:56.547
- That would be a tragedy.
- Yeah? Ma'am.

06:56.581 --> 06:58.048
- Oh, hi, Roger.
- Can we talk?

06:58.083 --> 07:00.585
Of course we can talk. Hey,
could I have my yogurt, please?

07:00.619 --> 07:02.720
Oh, here.
Don't eat it too fast.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.422
Oh, stop it, Nervous Nelly.

07:04.456 --> 07:07.559
All right, get me something
sloppy with a spoon to eat.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.094
- Do you want some yogurt?
- No, thanks.

07:09.128 --> 07:10.862
- You look good, by the way.
- Oh, thanks.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.217
What, are you
working out or what?

07:12.231 --> 07:15.200
Yeah, I'm burning calories
with the old anxiety diet.

07:15.234 --> 07:16.802
- Oh.
- You know, the anxiet.

07:16.836 --> 07:19.471
If you want to get some cardio
exercise, you have to have a heart.

07:19.506 --> 07:21.240
I heard a pretty lousy rumor

07:21.275 --> 07:24.577
<i>that you're not running for
reelection with POTUS in two years.</i>

07:24.611 --> 07:26.145
- Oh.
- And that would be disturbing

07:26.180 --> 07:28.681
because I kind of need you
to run as VP again.

07:28.715 --> 07:30.249
And then I get in the Senate

07:30.283 --> 07:32.752
and then you and I
run together as a team.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.821
- Remember, that was the deal.
- Yeah, I remember that.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.222
Where did you hear this rumor?

07:36.257 --> 07:37.857
Oh, I heard it from
the Gingerhead Man.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.859
The gash with the stash.
McLintock.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.360
What, are you kidding me?

07:41.395 --> 07:43.997
Mike sees knowledge as the enemy.
Forget about that.

07:44.031 --> 07:47.801
Then you are running with
the president in two years?

07:47.836 --> 07:50.704
I am absolutely running
in two years.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.807
And then four years
after that, reelection, baby.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.309
What do you mean reelection?

07:56.343 --> 07:58.644
Not reelection.
Election at that time.

07:58.679 --> 08:00.480
- Yep. Right.
- You and I election.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.248
Wait. But why did
you say reelection?

08:02.282 --> 08:03.916
- What?
- You said reelection.

08:03.951 --> 08:07.453
Which implies that perhaps
something else is going on.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.988
I meant election.
You know what I meant.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.156
- But you said reelection.
- I meant election, okay?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.858
It's like saying
flammable or inflammable.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.728
- It's the same thing.
- I smell a fucking rat.

08:16.762 --> 08:18.863
- Oh, stop it.
- I'll tell you what it is, too.

08:18.897 --> 08:20.498
It's this whole administration.

08:20.532 --> 08:22.233
And I'm gonna light a fire
under the whole thing.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.069
Then we'll find out whether
it's flammable or inflammable.

08:25.104 --> 08:27.905
<i>Come on, Wilbo Faggins,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

08:29.274 --> 08:31.576
Okay, where are my
beautiful veeple people?

08:31.610 --> 08:34.010
There's one.
I need my veeple

08:34.046 --> 08:36.481
to come into my office, please.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.450
Hey, it's J-Diddy.
Ladies get giddy.

08:39.485 --> 08:42.687
- Jonah. Hey, listen, settle something for me.
- Okay.

08:42.721 --> 08:45.423
You like to have sex
and you like to travel?

08:45.457 --> 08:49.027
- Yes, ma'am.
- Then you can fuck off.

08:49.061 --> 08:51.029
But I shall be right here
if you need me.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.431
Like the mighty oak
that stands for-- ma'am.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.836
I have something to say.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.838
I've literally no idea
what you're gonna say.

08:59.872 --> 09:04.176
I'm not leaving.
POTUS is leaving.

09:04.210 --> 09:07.379
He's not gonna run
for a second term.

09:07.413 --> 09:08.847
- I'm gonna run.
- Oh, my God!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.183
- I'm gonna run for president!
- Oh, yeah!

09:11.218 --> 09:13.719
- That's awesome.
- I did not see that coming.

09:13.753 --> 09:17.323
Selina Meyer,
she deals 'em fire. Bam!

09:17.357 --> 09:18.958
Boom! Let's go
to the fucking moon!

09:18.992 --> 09:20.893
I was this close
to living on my boat.

09:20.927 --> 09:24.697
- Oh, my God. I'm just--
- Congratulations, ma'am.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.833
( stammering ) Can you give me

09:26.867 --> 09:29.702
some time with my core team?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.005
- Um, Br-- Br-
- Ed.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.741
- Bre-- Ed.
- Of course.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.846
I feel as though I may
have missed something.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.881
If you need to
fill me in on that--

09:41.916 --> 09:43.616
Hey, what happened in there?

09:43.650 --> 09:45.418
They're celebrating

09:45.452 --> 09:47.753
because you weren't in there.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.322
Gears are already turning.

09:50.356 --> 09:52.658
- I see a lightbulb above your head.
- Bing!

09:52.692 --> 09:54.626
Okay, now listen, so...

09:54.661 --> 09:56.461
you guys don't need
to take other jobs.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.897
You're here with me.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.934
Uh, I've accepted
a number of posts.

10:02.969 --> 10:05.237
- Did you say a number?
- Currently four.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.039
Wow. You're gonna
cancel them, right?

10:07.073 --> 10:08.573
Oh, clearly.
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.976
I've said no to everything, ma'am.
I am here for you.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.944
- Good.
- Hey, ma'am.

10:12.979 --> 10:14.679
I took a job also.

10:18.551 --> 10:21.553
- I didn't mean you, Gary.
- I know.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.555
What job?

10:23.590 --> 10:25.958
I'm going into
business with Dana

10:26.026 --> 10:29.628
and we're doing
D&G Cheese Overseas.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.831
- Cheese?
- And it's overseas.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.267
Wait a minute. You're
choosing dead milk over me?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.068
No, don't say that.
That's not true.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.271
Well, you're just gonna have to
tell her you're not gonna do that.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.773
I can't.
I can't tell her that.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.175
Why not?
Are you scared of her?

10:42.209 --> 10:44.477
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:44.511 --> 10:48.514
Gary, you cannot let this woman

10:48.548 --> 10:50.649
have control over you, okay?

10:50.684 --> 10:53.186
Seriously, you have got
to stick up for yourself.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.587
You gotta work for me.

10:54.621 --> 10:57.123
Right. Right.
She scares me a lot.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.625
All right, call her in
and I'm gonna talk to her.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.427
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah. Got it.

11:01.461 --> 11:03.195
Ma'am, science fair
in 30 minutes.

11:03.230 --> 11:06.465
Okay, you go deal with that
and you cover for Gary, okay?

11:06.499 --> 11:08.033
You trust me
with that Leviathan?

11:08.067 --> 11:10.202
Uh, ma'am, I left
my BlackBerry in--

11:10.236 --> 11:12.371
Okay, now listen, I got
this science fair thing.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.640
So I want to make my speech

11:14.708 --> 11:17.143
- a little bit more presidential.
- Yeah.

11:17.211 --> 11:18.511
Like I'm Marilyn Monroe,

11:18.545 --> 11:20.346
just JFK the fuck out of me.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.215
- Ooh, I got something.
- You do?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.484
- Yeah, I do. I got something.
- Selina: <i>Fantastic.</i>

11:24.518 --> 11:26.852
I'm just completely
in the dark. If--

11:26.887 --> 11:29.522
I'm gonna go call Andrew.
Mm-mm-mm.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.158
- Uh-- uh--
- No, no, no, it's all about crazy money, Ame.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.126
He's got the crazy money

11:34.160 --> 11:35.594
and I'm crazy enough
to go get it.

11:35.628 --> 11:38.029
- ( laughs )
- As long as it's strictly business.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.166
Andy? It's me.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.168
<i>It's Lee.</i>

11:43.202 --> 11:44.902
Can you come here?

11:44.937 --> 11:48.239
<i>( laughing )</i>

11:50.609 --> 11:52.544
Dana:
<i>Oh, there he is.</i>

11:52.578 --> 11:55.280
Hey, quit being so hot. You're
gonna melt all my cheese.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.315
- Hi, you.
- Hi, sweetie. Hi.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.583
Hey, what's wrong?

11:58.618 --> 12:00.686
You look like you did when
I asked you to talk dirty.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.221
- You were just like, "I'm in you right now."
- Shh. I know, I know.

12:03.256 --> 12:05.858
Stop, stop. I wanted to talk
to you about something.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.459
Selina's gonna stay.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.896
Okay. Well, that
ship has sailed.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.898
You're on the good ship
Pecorino now.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.800
Yeah, I'm gonna stay,
too, I think.

12:13.834 --> 12:16.302
- No. No.
- Okay, listen--

12:16.337 --> 12:18.004
- Where's the Toscano?
- It's at D12.

12:18.039 --> 12:20.240
That's right over there, okay?
She needs me.

12:20.274 --> 12:22.042
It's like I'm her
central nervous system.

12:22.076 --> 12:24.078
Honey, she'll get another
bag bunny, I just know it.

12:24.112 --> 12:26.814
No, Brett, it's further down.
That's the Sardo, buddy.

12:26.848 --> 12:28.950
Okay, I'm not a bag bunny.

12:28.984 --> 12:31.652
It's like I'm Selina's
soul mate over there.

12:31.687 --> 12:34.989
- Okay, I love the stinking shit out of you, Gary.
- I know you do.

12:35.023 --> 12:36.991
She doesn't love you, okay?
She doesn't care.

12:37.025 --> 12:38.626
- She does care.
- You're just a guy that does a job for her.

12:38.660 --> 12:40.661
- That's not true.
- Who's more important to you?

12:40.729 --> 12:43.764
- Me or her?
- Okay, that choice, there's no way--

12:43.798 --> 12:45.119
Do we have any
with black truffle?

12:45.133 --> 12:47.300
That's F15.
Okay? F15.

12:47.335 --> 12:50.003
Listen, the choice you're giving me
between you and her, that's impossible.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.917
Sorry, not black truffle.
I meant white truffle.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.039
That's next to
the black truffle, okay.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.740
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Brett?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.810
This is not a big place, is it?
It's not a big place.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.578
I'm sorry. Would you
guys like some space?

12:59.612 --> 13:01.813
- Yeah!
- No! Stay right where you are.

13:01.847 --> 13:03.448
Okay, listen,
she wants to talk to you.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.149
- She wants to explain this to you.
- Fine.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.584
- Okay? Please?
- I'll go.

13:06.618 --> 13:08.452
I'm not afraid to fight for you, Gary.
That's the truth.

13:08.520 --> 13:09.754
No, no, no.
Bah, bah, bah, bah.

13:09.788 --> 13:11.822
Let's literally
not fight, all right?

13:11.857 --> 13:14.125
Okay?
That's good cheese.

13:17.530 --> 13:18.997
Amy, this is really happening.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.432
You know, listen,
just ignore that earlier me.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.967
The "Little House
on the Prairie" bullshit.

13:23.001 --> 13:25.737
No, updated me,
totally career focused

13:25.771 --> 13:27.051
and shooting
for the White House.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.874
Of course, and I am
right behind/beside you.

13:29.909 --> 13:32.410
You, Chief of Staff
to the president,

13:32.445 --> 13:35.880
me, chief of sexiness
and spooning.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.783
Yeah, but as I said,
the focus right now

13:38.817 --> 13:40.351
has got to be...

13:40.386 --> 13:43.555
- <i>( knocks )</i>
- Hey, Amy, can I talk to you about something?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.657
Accidental dick move.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.928
I had to write Selina's speech
for the science fair so fast

13:48.962 --> 13:52.699
that I think I plagiarized a
speech that I wrote for Chung.

13:52.733 --> 13:54.768
So here's Selina's hard copy

13:54.802 --> 13:57.337
and Chung's is already
up on his YouTube.

13:57.371 --> 14:00.273
I met a young woman
name Juanita.

14:00.308 --> 14:03.577
- Oh, here's the bit.
- It's not about what America means to me.

14:03.611 --> 14:05.912
<i>It's what I mean to America.</i>

14:05.947 --> 14:09.082
<i>Because America would be</i>
<i>nothing without Americans.</i>

14:09.117 --> 14:10.918
Jesus, you wrote this shit?

14:10.952 --> 14:13.320
Yeah, it's like
a noun-verb gumbo.

14:13.354 --> 14:15.322
So it's the fictitious girl.
I gave her the same girl.

14:15.356 --> 14:17.858
Although I did change it
from Juanita to Anita.

14:17.892 --> 14:19.626
Oh, that's a brilliant plan.

14:19.661 --> 14:21.662
Why don't you change America to Shmamerica?
Yeah, I'm calling Mike.

14:21.696 --> 14:24.164
No, I already tried him. It
went straight to voice mail.

14:24.198 --> 14:28.268
I met this young
scientist named Anita.

14:28.303 --> 14:30.370
- And I said to her...
- You got a charger?

14:30.405 --> 14:32.639
- Shh, I'm trying to watch.
- Okay, champ.

14:32.673 --> 14:34.942
...and she said, "It's not
what science means to me,

14:34.976 --> 14:37.911
it's what I mean
to science."

14:37.946 --> 14:41.014
Let's do this one first. This is a
mappable social media cloud for pets.

14:41.049 --> 14:42.983
- Oh, I'm impressed with that.
- Home run.

14:43.017 --> 14:44.785
Listen, let me tell you something.
Three words--

14:44.819 --> 14:46.520
caucus, primary, money.

14:46.554 --> 14:47.721
- Right?
- Go big.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.190
No, four words-- money again.
Right?

14:50.225 --> 14:52.326
'Cause that's what we need.
Mike, we need a lot of money.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.495
This is Rachel and Erica
over here, ma'am.

14:54.529 --> 14:56.330
- Oh, wow, what is this?
- It's an ant kibbutz.

14:56.364 --> 14:58.566
Okay. I would love
to look at that.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.201
Oh, and I just had a thought.

15:00.235 --> 15:02.704
- Remember that Iowa steak fry thing?
- Mm-hmm.

15:02.738 --> 15:04.005
- We need to go to that.
- Yeah.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.507
Seriously, 'cause there's
a lot of money there.

15:05.541 --> 15:08.276
- And steak.
- And steak. I love it.

15:08.311 --> 15:10.512
So, I know what you're thinking,
Madam Vice President.

15:10.547 --> 15:12.848
- You do? Uh-oh.
- A confined space, right?

15:12.882 --> 15:14.216
But it's a humane environment.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.618
Well, from up here,
they look like ants.

15:16.653 --> 15:19.388
- <i>( Mike chuckles )</i>
- That's a joke.

15:19.422 --> 15:21.457
- Because they are ants.
- This way, ma'am.

15:21.491 --> 15:24.359
- This is some kind of robot.
- Really? That's it?

15:24.394 --> 15:27.429
- Would you excuse me?
- Hey, Joe fucking Slow.

15:27.464 --> 15:29.498
You ever think about
answering your phone?

15:29.533 --> 15:32.201
Chill out. I lost my charger.
You got one?

15:32.236 --> 15:35.005
You're at a science fair. One of these
kids could build you a charger.

15:35.039 --> 15:37.641
- What's the problem?
- Ben's been trying to get in touch with the veep all day.

15:37.675 --> 15:38.709
All right, well, she's busy.

15:38.743 --> 15:40.277
Sorry there, Todd.
Just real quick.

15:40.345 --> 15:42.012
- Oh.
- Matters of state.

15:42.046 --> 15:44.315
Sir, yes, I have the vice
president for you. It's Ben.

15:44.349 --> 15:46.617
- Give her a little space.
- Hi, Ben. How's it going?

15:46.651 --> 15:49.420
Furlong has been spraying
all over town

15:49.454 --> 15:52.556
that you think
POTUS is gonna quit.

15:52.590 --> 15:56.827
What? I didn't say anything
to that crusty ass clown.

15:56.861 --> 15:58.762
I might have mixed up
a couple words, but...

15:58.797 --> 16:01.331
Well, now POTUS can't say that he
won't be running for reelection

16:01.366 --> 16:03.433
<i>because it'll look like</i>
<i>he's being pushed out.</i>

16:03.468 --> 16:04.935
So now our spineless,

16:04.969 --> 16:07.504
flip-floppy fuckbag
is staying.

16:07.538 --> 16:10.173
- Oh, boy.
- Is everything okay?

16:10.208 --> 16:13.143
I've got to get out of here before
I set fire to one of these nerds.

16:13.178 --> 16:14.818
- Okay, okay, let's go.
- That's my phone.

16:14.846 --> 16:17.081
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Girl: Madam Vice President.

16:17.115 --> 16:19.884
- No.
- We're so sorry. She really likes it,

16:19.918 --> 16:21.618
but unfortunately she's
out of time, you guys.

16:21.653 --> 16:24.588
But this man right here
is gonna take over for her.

16:24.623 --> 16:28.025
Don't fuck this up. This is a public
relations nightmare waiting to happen.

16:28.060 --> 16:30.795
Promise them everything.
Thank you, kids.

16:30.829 --> 16:32.930
<i>( sirens blaring )</i>

16:38.236 --> 16:40.504
- Ma'am, are you--

16:42.000 --> 16:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here

16:49.948 --> 16:52.683
( muffled screaming )

16:52.718 --> 16:55.319
Dan: <i>I thought you'd
like this spot.</i>

16:55.354 --> 16:58.223
DC's current go-to place for
these off-the-record meets.

16:58.257 --> 17:01.392
Good choice. Under the radar as
we used to say in the military.

17:01.427 --> 17:03.395
Yeah, I think other
people say that, too.

17:03.429 --> 17:05.864
It's about loyalty
to the truth.

17:05.897 --> 17:07.798
And to the American people.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.468
Furlong and Doyle have turned
their guns on the president.

17:10.502 --> 17:12.869
That's the worst kind
of friendly fire.

17:12.905 --> 17:14.605
The unfriendly kind.

17:14.638 --> 17:16.507
Yeah, oh, Danny, I just
want to let you know,

17:16.540 --> 17:18.675
one of your anecdotes
may have accidentally

17:18.710 --> 17:20.611
made its way into
a veep speech via me.

17:20.646 --> 17:22.780
And I'd really appreciate it if
you could let this one slide.

17:22.815 --> 17:25.349
Selina's a plagiarist?
That's perfect.

17:25.384 --> 17:26.984
You just handed me
a silver bullet.

17:27.019 --> 17:28.520
And as you know,
I'm a good shot.

17:28.554 --> 17:32.323
I might back away, though,
from calling her a liar.

17:32.358 --> 17:34.959
After all, you didn't really meet
anyone named Juanita who said that.

17:34.994 --> 17:37.595
No, I did. As I recall,
it went something like...

17:37.630 --> 17:40.865
( Spanish accent ) "Mr. Ching,
I come to America to work.

17:40.899 --> 17:43.969
I send money home, but life
here is so hard for me."

17:44.003 --> 17:46.137
I didn't know you did voices.

17:46.171 --> 17:47.472
( laughs )

17:49.975 --> 17:51.442
Sue, come here.

17:51.476 --> 17:54.045
- Where's Dan?
- He stepped out.

17:54.079 --> 17:55.613
Um, ahem.

17:55.648 --> 18:00.284
POTUS has decided
that he is staying,

18:00.318 --> 18:03.988
and he is going to seek
reelection after all.

18:04.022 --> 18:05.656
Of course he wants to stay.

18:05.690 --> 18:08.993
Could you just not...

18:09.027 --> 18:10.527
So he's running
for a second term,

18:10.562 --> 18:12.863
which means I won't be
running for a first term.

18:12.897 --> 18:15.832
So there's no point in my staying.
I'm just gonna leave.

18:15.867 --> 18:19.102
- So he changed his mind again?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

18:19.136 --> 18:21.437
Jesus, the inside of his head
must be like an Escher drawing.

18:21.472 --> 18:23.539
Sue: <i>Ma'am, Andrew
is here to see you.</i>

18:23.574 --> 18:25.942
Oh, good, more hurt
and disappointment.

18:25.976 --> 18:28.010
There is one
other thing that--

18:28.045 --> 18:30.513
and I'm so sorry
to let you down,

18:30.580 --> 18:33.483
but I'm gonna stay with Selina.

18:34.685 --> 18:36.820
You think you get to decide

18:36.854 --> 18:38.555
on whether or not I hire you?

18:38.589 --> 18:41.558
There are plenty
of Dans out there, Dan.

18:41.593 --> 18:44.228
Look around.

18:44.263 --> 18:46.064
Sorry, kid.

18:46.098 --> 18:48.467
Hey, don't call me kid, okay?

18:48.501 --> 18:50.702
I mean, A: you're not
Jimmy Cagney, all right?

18:50.736 --> 18:52.871
And B: we're practically
the same fucking age.

18:52.905 --> 18:55.440
Then it must really hurt to know how
much more I've achieved in life.

18:55.474 --> 18:58.109
Decorated veteran.
President-in-waiting.

18:58.143 --> 19:00.611
Oh, okay. Do you see this?
See this right here?

19:00.646 --> 19:03.681
You know what this is? This is me playing
"Fuck You" on the world's biggest cello.

19:03.715 --> 19:06.216
Oh, I think someone just suicide
bombed their own future.

19:06.251 --> 19:09.720
God, you know, if I had a dollar for every
time you mentioned that goddamn war,

19:09.754 --> 19:12.022
I would buy a tank and I would
blow your fat fucking head off.

19:12.057 --> 19:14.692
- Wow. Well, I'm sorry, Dan.
- <i>( phone chimes )</i>

19:14.726 --> 19:18.362
I hate to leave a man down,
but I'll see you around.

19:20.398 --> 19:21.498
Danny.
Danny, hey.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.535
Are you fucking kidding me?

19:23.569 --> 19:25.436
You brought me
over here for nothing?

19:25.471 --> 19:28.039
Are you really talking
to me like this right now?

19:28.073 --> 19:31.342
- I have shit to do.
- I am in a bad way.

19:31.377 --> 19:33.678
Honestly, it's so out of line.

19:33.712 --> 19:35.947
- It's so out of line.
- It is.

19:35.981 --> 19:37.415
You get fucked
by everybody in DC--

19:37.449 --> 19:40.085
your friends, your enemies,

19:40.119 --> 19:42.320
your colleagues,
your fucking family.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.888
That's Washington, DC, for you.

19:43.923 --> 19:45.556
DC-- District of Cunts.

19:45.591 --> 19:48.492
Ma'am, you remember
Sally, T.J., and Paul.

19:48.527 --> 19:51.729
This is my nerd herd. And I
mean that affectionately.

19:51.764 --> 19:53.164
Jonah, this is
a restricted area.

19:53.199 --> 19:55.500
We're like Area 51
except more restricted.

19:55.535 --> 19:57.402
- Jonah, can you come here just for a second?
- Yeah.

19:57.437 --> 19:59.705
Do you want to fill me in as
to what's going on right now?

19:59.739 --> 20:02.407
Yes, ma'am. Your abrupt
exit from the science fair.

20:02.442 --> 20:05.211
Mike needed a PR fix, so you have to
give these guys a West Wing tour.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.612
- What?
- Uh, ma'am.

20:06.646 --> 20:07.746
This has got to stop.

20:07.781 --> 20:09.715
You should be aware that
the president is on his way.

20:09.749 --> 20:11.350
Hey, why don't we go sit
on these chairs for a second?

20:11.384 --> 20:12.952
What did you say? The
president is coming here?

20:12.986 --> 20:14.307
- Yes.
- Why? He never comes here.

20:14.321 --> 20:16.856
I don't know. Information-wise,
I am becalmed.

20:16.890 --> 20:18.290
The president is coming here?

20:18.325 --> 20:20.960
Gary, Dana just cleared security.
This is anarchy.

20:20.994 --> 20:23.329
Hey, ma'am, is now a bad
time to talk to Dana?

20:23.397 --> 20:26.065
- Yeah!
- Okay, let me just go fix that.

20:26.132 --> 20:28.200
I'll fix that.

20:30.404 --> 20:32.538
- Hey. Hey.
- Gary who I'm gonna marry.

20:32.572 --> 20:34.907
Fiancée in the house.
Ooh, ooh!

20:34.942 --> 20:36.342
This is not a good time, baby.

20:36.376 --> 20:38.678
I brought the Pecorino
Duo Grande sampler.

20:38.712 --> 20:41.347
- Shaved and grated.
- Okay, I'll just give this to her.

20:41.381 --> 20:43.282
But why?
Oh, my God, is it Selina?

20:43.317 --> 20:44.884
Right? She doesn't
like me, is that it?

20:44.918 --> 20:47.219
- She loves you.
- Then what is it?

20:47.254 --> 20:49.289
Shh, shh.

20:49.323 --> 20:51.658
- POTUS is coming.
- Oh, my God!

20:51.692 --> 20:53.927
There's a lot of security and he
doesn't like a lot of people around.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.796
He should get the basket. Right?
We'll get him to tweet about it.

20:56.831 --> 20:58.598
It'll be great publicity.
You know I'm right.

20:58.633 --> 21:00.500
Is he gonna drop me
from the ticket?

21:00.535 --> 21:02.069
- Is that what's going on? He's gone postal.
- I have no idea.

21:02.104 --> 21:03.337
- Ma'am.
- What?

21:03.372 --> 21:04.606
You've got to mello yellow.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.241
Don't tell me not to panic.

21:06.275 --> 21:07.809
I know how to freak out, okay?

21:07.843 --> 21:10.712
Everybody can just
shut the shit up.

21:10.746 --> 21:12.547
- I got to think.
- Okay.

21:12.581 --> 21:16.084
- We know what she's like.
- Andrew, don't talk to me.

21:16.118 --> 21:17.519
Ma'am, should I get Jonah
to get the kids--

21:17.553 --> 21:19.053
I'll get Jonah
to get the kids out.

21:19.088 --> 21:20.755
Jonah, why don't you put
the kids in my office?

21:20.789 --> 21:23.091
- Mike. Mike.
- Is the president coming?

21:23.125 --> 21:26.761
- Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!
- Ma'am, I'm coming.

21:26.795 --> 21:28.563
- I'm here. I'm here.
- Come here.

21:28.597 --> 21:30.031
- We got to make a statement.
- Okay.

21:30.065 --> 21:32.700
Because I think POTUS is coming
here to kick me off the ticket.

21:32.734 --> 21:35.069
And I've got to make a statement
saying I'm leaving the ticket

21:35.103 --> 21:38.205
before he drops me from it. I've got to
jump before we get stabbed in the back.

21:38.239 --> 21:40.207
- Danny Chung is making an announcement.
- What?

21:40.242 --> 21:42.876
I was proud to serve
in the military.

21:42.911 --> 21:44.511
I'm proud to serve
as a governor.

21:44.546 --> 21:47.047
<i>Today I've set up</i>
<i>an exploratory committee</i>

21:47.082 --> 21:49.716
- to look into whether in a couple of years...
- Okay.

21:49.751 --> 21:53.486
...I might be of use serving
at an even higher level.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.222
Does she make you happy?
Because I make you happy.

21:56.256 --> 21:57.957
Of course you make
me happy, baby.

21:57.992 --> 22:00.459
- Ma'am, we're gonna have to ask you to leave.
- What is this?

22:00.494 --> 22:02.194
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

22:02.228 --> 22:04.163
We are gonna talk about this
when we get home.

22:04.197 --> 22:06.398
- You are my diamond.
- <i>I am a diamond in the rough.</i>

22:06.433 --> 22:08.467
- I know you're a diamond.
- <i>Get your hands off me.</i>

22:08.501 --> 22:10.302
I know what I'm gonna do.

22:10.337 --> 22:12.371
I'm gonna run against Chung.

22:12.406 --> 22:14.140
Okay? I'm gonna take
myself off the ticket.

22:14.174 --> 22:17.010
I'll run against Chung
and I'll run against POTUS.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.079
It'll be like
a political massacre.

22:19.113 --> 22:21.215
Quit freaking out. You need
to get your head together.

22:21.249 --> 22:23.216
What do you mean? The president's
gonna be here any second.

22:23.251 --> 22:24.952
Lookie, lookie, lookie, lookie.

22:24.987 --> 22:26.621
- This is for you.
- What?

22:26.655 --> 22:28.756
It's like a Pecorino
peace offering.

22:28.790 --> 22:30.258
What the crippling fuck
is going on with you?

22:30.292 --> 22:32.627
- I got rid of Dana.
- You've got to get out of here.

22:32.662 --> 22:35.430
- Get out of here.
- I have POTUS incoming!

22:35.464 --> 22:37.865
- I have POTUS incoming!
- Make a statement, Mike.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.534
- About what? About what?
- Everything.

22:39.568 --> 22:41.469
All possible statements
that you can even think of.

22:41.504 --> 22:43.504
Okay, I'll come up
with something.

22:43.539 --> 22:45.873
- Let's go say hi to POTUS.
- Don't talk to me like I'm a crazy person.

22:45.908 --> 22:47.375
I didn't mean to.
It came out weird.

22:47.409 --> 22:50.545
Jonah: <i>Make a hole, yo. POTUS
coming through. Make a hole.</i>

22:51.780 --> 22:53.181
T.J.:
You're not the president.

22:53.215 --> 22:55.550
No, but you're not Justin
Bieber either, are you, sport?

22:55.584 --> 22:57.852
Ma'am.
POTUS is here.

22:57.886 --> 22:59.587
Where?

22:59.622 --> 23:01.389
Has he been miniaturized?

23:01.423 --> 23:02.924
He's right in that room.

23:02.958 --> 23:04.626
Would you care to join him
in your office?

23:04.660 --> 23:06.928
Uh...

23:08.196 --> 23:10.064
- Am I about to get whacked?
- No, no, no.

23:10.098 --> 23:13.567
No, it's good to see you again.
Take care.

23:13.602 --> 23:17.004
Your boss wants to see you.
Don't keep him waiting.

23:20.174 --> 23:21.841
What's going on here?

23:21.909 --> 23:24.177
Is it Bring a Disparate
Person to Work Day?

23:24.211 --> 23:27.147
Uh, Selina is about to get a
Potal bullet through the head

23:27.181 --> 23:29.682
and you are all about to be
unemployed and homeless.

23:29.716 --> 23:32.318
But, Amy, I don't want you to worry.
You can crash at my place.

23:32.352 --> 23:34.420
We're so fucked.
We're so fucked.

23:34.454 --> 23:36.354
We've fucked DC over
so many different ways,

23:36.389 --> 23:38.089
no one's gonna hire us now.

23:38.157 --> 23:40.625
How am I gonna pay
for my fucking boat?

23:40.660 --> 23:42.561
Enough about
the fucking boat, Mike.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.930
Take a flare gun, put it in your
mouth, and blow your head off.

23:44.964 --> 23:46.398
Listen to yourselves.
You people are monsters.

23:46.432 --> 23:48.299
Sue: <i>Ed, you really need
to can it right now.</i>

23:48.333 --> 23:49.600
Do not comment
on this office, okay?

23:49.634 --> 23:52.002
Hey, Sue, don't talk
to me that way, okay?

23:52.037 --> 23:53.804
<i>You're the secretary</i>
<i>to the vice president.</i>

23:53.838 --> 23:57.841
That's like being
Garfunkel's roadie, okay?

23:57.876 --> 24:00.377
So this is Selina's
team in action.

24:00.412 --> 24:02.679
- That explains a lot to me.
- Likewise.

24:02.713 --> 24:04.414
Yeah, well, they're actually
better than my team.

24:04.448 --> 24:06.816
My team is just
fucking horrible.

24:10.688 --> 24:12.322
Ma'am?

24:13.357 --> 24:14.991
Hi.

24:15.026 --> 24:18.061
I think I know what you're gonna
say, but I don't wanna jinx it.

24:18.095 --> 24:20.664
POTUS is <i>not</i>

24:20.698 --> 24:23.033
gonna be running
for a second term.

24:23.067 --> 24:24.968
- Gary: <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- I'm gonna run.

24:25.003 --> 24:27.871
Whoa, whoa! Ma'am, give me
the straight poop here.

24:27.906 --> 24:29.626
- Is this for real?
- It's totally for real.

24:29.641 --> 24:31.575
Oh, thank you! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

24:31.610 --> 24:33.710
- Can we make it public?
- No, no, no, no.

24:33.745 --> 24:36.380
- We got to wait for POTUS to make a statement.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:44.823 --> 24:46.224
( laughs )

24:46.258 --> 24:48.159
Ma'am, of all the places
that I have liaised,

24:48.194 --> 24:50.428
I have enjoyed liaising
here the most.

24:50.463 --> 24:52.898
Okay, guys, we don't want to
get ahead of ourselves here.

24:52.965 --> 24:55.100
- We've got a lot of work.
- Yep, a long road ahead.

24:55.134 --> 24:56.901
- Right?
- And we're going all the way.

24:56.936 --> 24:58.870
And for the record, ma'am,
I always believed in you.

24:58.904 --> 25:02.407
Well, I have to say that
I believed in me, too.

25:02.441 --> 25:04.009
- Amy: <i>Of course.</i>
- Yeah.

25:04.043 --> 25:06.378
POTUS, he knew the gig was up

25:06.446 --> 25:09.180
because Doyle, Furlong, Chung

25:09.215 --> 25:10.982
all turned the party
against him.

25:11.016 --> 25:13.485
I mean, it was just,
you know, RIP-OTUS.

25:13.519 --> 25:16.287
Just complete sinking shit.

25:16.322 --> 25:20.058
No, he had to go. Together we
are going to make history.

25:20.092 --> 25:21.660
We're going to
the White House, ma'am.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.028
Boom, boom, pow.

25:23.062 --> 25:26.931
Oh, yeah.
Yeah. Wow.

25:26.966 --> 25:29.301
( all laugh )

25:30.970 --> 25:32.170
My brain is at
your service, ma'am.

25:32.205 --> 25:34.239
- We'll see.
- Ma'am, I am so psyched.

25:34.274 --> 25:36.435
And the science fair speech
was plagiarized from Chung.

25:36.443 --> 25:37.977
Just wanted you
to know that up front.

25:38.011 --> 25:40.479
- What? What? What? What?
- Yep.

25:40.514 --> 25:42.114
- <i>You're kidding.</i>
- No.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.983
- And so it begins.
- Yeah, with a kick to the tits.

25:45.018 --> 25:47.987
So, Dan, you're gonna have to
clean up your own shitty diaper.

25:48.021 --> 25:50.056
- <i>Got it?</i>
- Not a problem.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.525
You know what? We got to talk
about the campaign, don't we?

25:52.559 --> 25:54.560
- Okay. I'm right behind you.
- Okay, great.

25:54.595 --> 25:56.662
Gary, call Dana.
She's called 90 times.

25:56.697 --> 25:58.965
- Gary: <i>Shit.</i>
- Talk to her, then sedate her.

26:00.200 --> 26:02.835
Ma'am, the president
has left the building.

26:02.870 --> 26:04.971
- Who gives a flying fuck?
- ( all laugh )

26:05.039 --> 26:08.174
- Not yet.
- Sorry. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it.

26:08.208 --> 26:10.509
Ma'am, West Wing.

26:10.544 --> 26:12.612
- This is your fault.
- No, no.

26:12.646 --> 26:15.548
I didn't arrive soon enough to
be able to cut out the cancer.

26:15.582 --> 26:19.052
Oh, no, I think you arrived with
a man bag filled with tumors.

26:19.086 --> 26:21.187
That was POTUS's problem.

26:21.222 --> 26:23.723
Because he relied
on those two guys.

26:23.757 --> 26:26.626
One a burnt-out loser,
the other a conniving robot.

26:26.661 --> 26:28.962
- Crazy.
- Bad combo, yeah.

26:30.264 --> 26:32.899
- Oh, hello, kids.
- Come on in.

26:32.934 --> 26:35.669
Oh, my God, have you been
here this whole time?

26:35.703 --> 26:37.671
M&Ms for the scientists.

26:37.705 --> 26:39.339
So come with me
'cause I've got an idea.

26:39.373 --> 26:41.141
I might show you around
the West Wing.

26:41.175 --> 26:43.176
- Gary: Ahh!
- Would you?

26:43.211 --> 26:44.944
- Do you like government?
- Yes.

26:44.979 --> 26:46.779
- And do you like politics?
- Yeah.

26:46.814 --> 26:49.349
Oh, good. Because politics is
about people, don't you think?

26:49.383 --> 26:51.384
- Yeah.
- It is when you think about it.

26:51.419 --> 26:54.120
<i>'Cause without people,</i>
<i>you can't have politics.</i>

26:54.155 --> 26:55.622
See how crowded this is?

26:55.656 --> 26:57.424
I mean, it's very
claustrophobic.

26:57.458 --> 27:01.195
I think that the president
should only have her staff here.

27:01.230 --> 27:03.264
Or his staff.
You know, their staff.

27:03.298 --> 27:05.459
I mean, I've never seen--
like that one we just passed,

27:05.468 --> 27:06.568
I don't know
who that person is.

27:06.602 --> 27:07.936
I've never seen
that person in my life.

27:07.970 --> 27:09.170
No business being here.

27:09.205 --> 27:12.507
Selina did not plagiarize
Danny Chung's speech.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.243
Mike's already told you that.

27:14.277 --> 27:15.811
No, I am not plagiarizing Mike.

27:15.845 --> 27:18.514
I know it's boring,
but, hey, I'm boring.

27:18.548 --> 27:21.650
Those curtains there are going.

27:21.685 --> 27:23.719
Wow, those are hideous.

27:23.753 --> 27:26.889
- We're still together, right?
- Ed, I haven't got time.

27:26.924 --> 27:29.626
Time for us or do you mean
time as a general concept?

27:29.660 --> 27:32.162
Hi, Terry. I am sorry
I missed your call.

27:32.196 --> 27:35.733
Hi, Dana. Hey.
Hey, listen.

27:35.767 --> 27:37.468
I just wanted to say that--

27:37.502 --> 27:40.137
Okay. Okay. If you've got
something to say, you go first.

27:40.172 --> 27:43.374
Was your mom plagiarizing the Bible
when she said, "Oh, God, oh, God"?

27:43.409 --> 27:46.445
The president's chair
is a couple inches higher

27:46.479 --> 27:48.614
than the rest of the chairs
in the Oval Office.

27:48.648 --> 27:51.016
And I used to think, "Oh, my
God, that's so ridiculous."

27:51.050 --> 27:52.351
But now I think it makes sense

27:52.385 --> 27:54.265
because I think it's a good
psychological trick.

27:54.287 --> 27:57.289
Yeah, that's what I-- you're
not finished? Go ahead.

27:57.323 --> 28:00.125
Oh, she loved the cheese.

28:00.159 --> 28:01.960
Loved it.

28:01.995 --> 28:04.664
When I grow up, I want to be
vice president just like you.

28:04.698 --> 28:07.300
Oh, no, you don't.
You want to be president.
