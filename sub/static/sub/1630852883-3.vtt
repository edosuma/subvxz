Craig: In order to save
the creek, Craig had no choice

00:30.113 --> 00:32.949
but to challenge
the notorious King Xavier --

00:32.949 --> 00:34.784
capture-the-flag war!

00:34.868 --> 00:36.536
The fight was long and tough,

00:36.536 --> 00:39.998
but Craig and his friends
were able to pull through...

00:39.998 --> 00:41.833
and Craig captured the flag!

00:44.002 --> 00:46.379
But did that mean
Craig was the new king?

00:46.463 --> 00:48.298
"Does that mean
you're the new king?"

00:48.298 --> 00:49.591
"No, Kelsey.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.178
Because the creek
is for everyone!"

00:53.178 --> 00:55.263
So you littered?

00:55.263 --> 00:58.725
No! I saved the creek
so all kids could play freely

00:58.725 --> 00:59.976
and be themselves!

00:59.976 --> 01:01.895
What do you want,
a sticker?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.563
No.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.814
I-I mean, why?

01:04.898 --> 01:06.775
D-Do you have one that says
"creek saver" on it?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.902
You saved the creek.
Big whoop.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.988
I tried fish for the first time
that wasn't a fish stick.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.073
Where's <i>my</i> parade,
Craiggy?!

01:14.157 --> 01:16.284
So I was thinking this weekend
would be a good chance

01:16.284 --> 01:18.495
to visit those colleges
I showed you yesterday.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.746
What do you think, Mom?

01:19.746 --> 01:20.997
Nicole: I think
you have two years

01:20.997 --> 01:22.874
to do all the research
you want.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.460
But the choice
has already been made.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.003
You're going
to Howard.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.171
All of you.

01:28.171 --> 01:30.131
Who's Howard?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.549
More important question...

01:31.633 --> 01:33.718
What is that thing
on your face, Bernard?

01:33.802 --> 01:36.596
It's a sign of maturity,
Craig!

01:36.596 --> 01:39.808
Besides, got to get
my college look ready.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.019
Oh, yeah?
Heh.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.313
Well, I got to get
my creek look ready!

01:50.360 --> 01:53.488
Wow!
Replanting's looking great!

01:53.488 --> 01:54.614
Hey, JP!
Hey, Maney!

01:54.614 --> 01:57.826
Hey, Craig!
Uh.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.707
Wow,
I don't think I ever realized

02:04.791 --> 02:06.709
how many comics
you guys have.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.711
This one looks cool!

02:08.795 --> 02:10.672
My cousin brought those
from Korea.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.382
I only know
English and Japanese,

02:12.382 --> 02:14.425
but he's teaching me
how to read in Korean.

02:14.509 --> 02:17.428
Would it be cool if I came here
and read them with you sometime?

02:17.512 --> 02:18.680
Of course!

02:18.680 --> 02:20.139
The waterfall isn't
just for training.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.017
It's for all things
graphic novels.

02:23.101 --> 02:26.855
Aha, don't worry. We'll have you
poppin' wheelies in no time!

02:26.855 --> 02:27.897
Wow!

02:27.981 --> 02:29.232
Ever since I helped
the creek,

02:29.232 --> 02:31.609
construction has
really "ramped" up.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.114
Ah. Yeah, I guess they
couldn't hear me.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.657
All: We did.

02:39.409 --> 02:43.246
Man, the creek is changing
even more than Bernard's face.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.998
And now that the king's gone,

02:44.998 --> 02:47.250
there's a whole other side
to explore.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.626
That's pretty cool.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.836
Huh?

02:51.337 --> 02:52.338
Hey.

02:52.422 --> 02:54.841
Omar! You're back!
Where have you been?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.217
After the king
was defeated,

02:56.301 --> 02:58.511
I no longer needed
to guard the overpass,

02:58.595 --> 03:01.097
so I left the creek...
forever.

03:01.097 --> 03:03.141
Until my sister said I couldn't
sit around the house all day

03:03.141 --> 03:04.559
playing video games

03:04.559 --> 03:06.644
and my brother-in-law
paid me five bucks to leave.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.272
So here I am.
Five bucks richer.

03:09.272 --> 03:12.275
Whoa, your brother-in-law
gave you $5?

03:12.275 --> 03:13.943
Wait,
you have a brother-in-law?!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.320
Hey, where's Kelsey
and JP?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.363
They're helping some of
the other kids rebuild.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.116
Oh, well, I'll come back
when y'all are hanging out.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.118
What? No.
We can hang out.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.328
Just the two of us.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.622
I could introduce you
to the other kids.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.124
Everybody knows your boy Craig
around here, heh.

03:28.124 --> 03:29.959
Especially since
I saved the creek.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.336
What do you say?

03:31.336 --> 03:34.213
Hmm.
Yeah, all right.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.884
Heyoo, Kit!

03:37.884 --> 03:39.802
Two Spicy Beefers, please.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.597
And I'll, uh, I'll take that
with the hero discount.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.975
Nice try, cowboy,
but that's gonna be full price.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.061
Oh, right!
You might not have heard

03:48.061 --> 03:49.520
'cause you were
at summer school.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.814
Yeah.
I wonder why.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.151
Hey, I tried to help!
Look, I saved the creek!

03:55.151 --> 03:56.819
I know,
but so did they.

03:56.903 --> 03:58.655
I can't
give you all discounts.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.114
I got trade margins
to cover!

04:00.198 --> 04:01.574
Hey, Jacob!

04:01.658 --> 04:04.535
Dang, can't a brother get
some acknowledgment around here?

04:04.619 --> 04:06.371
Anyway, this is Omar.

04:06.371 --> 04:09.499
Oh, hey.
Uh, nice to meet you.

04:09.499 --> 04:10.583
Officially.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.585
Oh, I remember you!

04:12.669 --> 04:14.921
You were pretty scary
in that Green Poncho,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.297
but you're a lot
less intimidating

04:16.381 --> 04:17.924
when you're not
sinking rafts.

04:17.924 --> 04:19.968
How about some chips
for having to put up with Craig?

04:19.968 --> 04:21.678
Wait, what?!

04:20.051 --> 04:21.678
Oh, sounds good.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.096
Wait, what?!

04:23.096 --> 04:26.516
If y'all are good, you mind
scooching over a little bit?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.017
My new suppliers are here.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.561
We <i>were</i>
the Rangers of Honeysuckle!

04:30.645 --> 04:32.480
But the king is gone!

04:32.480 --> 04:34.482
So please just call us...

04:34.482 --> 04:36.526
Raj and Shawn!

04:36.526 --> 04:39.529
Aah!
The Green Poncho!

04:39.529 --> 04:41.864
It's cool.
The Green Poncho is gone.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.449
This is Omar!

04:43.533 --> 04:44.659
'Sup.

04:44.659 --> 04:47.537
Oh. Hey!
Uh, sorry. Force of habit.

04:47.537 --> 04:49.205
We were just here
to pick up a shipment.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.415
Yes!

04:50.415 --> 04:53.751
We're stocking up
<i>our</i> hangout, the...

04:53.835 --> 04:55.670
Candy Bar!

04:55.670 --> 04:57.839
You guys are heading back
to the other side?

04:57.839 --> 04:59.173
Do you need
any help mapping or --

04:59.257 --> 05:02.093
I mean, uh,
<i>carrying</i> your stuff?

05:03.302 --> 05:05.763
Yes, please!

05:05.847 --> 05:11.269
Clever, ever,
never, sever...

05:11.269 --> 05:12.603
Oh! Sever.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.313
Raj, whatchu --
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!

05:14.397 --> 05:15.690
I'm in the zone!

05:15.690 --> 05:18.693
Ahh!
This brings back memories.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.779
Standing up there.
Holding the flag.

05:21.863 --> 05:24.240
Huh, I just think about
all the time I spent

05:24.240 --> 05:25.825
watching over the creek.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.995
I bet it feels better being
down here, hanging with us.

05:28.995 --> 05:33.416
Yeah. It was nice to feel like
I was part of something bigger.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.002
Quick!
What rhymes with "majestic"?!

05:36.002 --> 05:37.253
Oh!
"You guessed it"!

05:37.253 --> 05:39.756
No.
But I like where you head's at.

05:39.756 --> 05:40.965
Hm, "domestic."

05:41.049 --> 05:44.093
Ohh, "domestic."
I can work with that!

05:46.179 --> 05:53.686
♪ Oh, the creek, the creek ♪

05:53.770 --> 05:56.564
♪ Now bigger than ever ♪

05:56.564 --> 06:01.110

06:12.205 --> 06:13.706
Where's the part
about Craig?!

06:13.790 --> 06:17.126
Yeah!
Craig saved the creek!

06:17.210 --> 06:18.961
What?
I'm practically a hero.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.714
Heroes deserve ballads.
Wolfgang: You!

06:21.798 --> 06:23.382
Ah, yes, here we go.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.384
Some recognition
for what I've done.

06:25.468 --> 06:28.846
You did this!

06:28.930 --> 06:30.973
Whoa, hey,
I didn't do anything.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.809
No, not you,
random kid!

06:32.809 --> 06:34.143
The Green Poncho!

06:34.227 --> 06:35.853
No, no, no.
I'm just Omar now.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.856
I used to tap-dance for my lord,
the king,

06:38.940 --> 06:41.275
until you hit me
with a bubblegum arrow!

06:41.359 --> 06:42.860
My hair was so sticky,

06:42.944 --> 06:45.655
my stepdad had to take a razor
to my scalp to get it out!

06:45.655 --> 06:48.699
Now everybody calls me
Tommy Top Hat!

06:48.783 --> 06:51.160
That's actually kind of cool,
Tommy.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.830
My name is Wolfgang!

06:53.830 --> 06:55.665
Oh, yeah.
That's cooler.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.084
Okay, Top Hat!

06:58.084 --> 06:59.585
You've had way
too much chocolate!

06:59.669 --> 07:03.673
I hate you,
Green Poncho!

07:03.673 --> 07:05.049
Yikes.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.176
Well, he could be talking
about anybody.

07:07.260 --> 07:09.178
I wouldn't
worry about it, Omar.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.763
Omar?

07:10.847 --> 07:13.057
Omar?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.310
Omar! Huh?

07:16.394 --> 07:18.855
Oh, you're right here.
Ah, I thought you'd be farther.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.773
Look, don't worry
about that kid.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.401
A lot of stuff happened
when the king ruled the creek.

07:23.401 --> 07:26.445
It'll take some time,
but people will get over it.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.614
I don't think they will.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.159
I'll always just be
the Green Poncho to them.

07:31.159 --> 07:33.286
You know, you could take off
the hoodie.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.289
Yeah, but I can't
take off my past.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.374
Wow, man.
That's deep.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.459
Dillard: Help!
Like, help!

07:42.587 --> 07:44.005
Hang on, Dillard!

07:44.005 --> 07:48.050
I'm hangin', like, that's all
I can -- aah! -- d-do!

07:48.134 --> 07:49.385
Oh, no!

07:49.385 --> 07:51.470
No bow.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.515
Quick!
Give me your hand!

07:56.392 --> 07:58.895
Uhh!
Slipping!

08:02.398 --> 08:03.441
Hm!

08:10.031 --> 08:11.616
Wow!

08:11.616 --> 08:14.076
Whoa!
That was wild, boys.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.996
Yeah, thanks for saving
Dillard's clumsy butt.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.750
Can you believe this fool
really tried to jump the creek?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.585
Scoot said I had it!

08:22.585 --> 08:24.170
You did till you didn't,
bro-tato.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.714
Whoa! Whoa-oa!
Oof!

08:26.714 --> 08:29.926
I guess, in his defense,
we're a bit rusty on wheels

08:29.926 --> 08:33.095
ever since the king banned
roller-skating from the creek.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.139
His royal highness
pitched a fit

08:35.223 --> 08:36.849
when he couldn't
skate backwards.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.893
He busted his whole butt!

08:38.893 --> 08:40.186
Scoot said he had it!

08:40.186 --> 08:42.063
He did!
Till he didn't.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.607
You guys couldn't skate
all this time?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.651
Well, we tried to skate
in the parking lot

08:46.651 --> 08:48.027
of my parents' store,

08:48.027 --> 08:49.779
but then Mariah
had the idea to --

08:49.779 --> 08:51.239
Change the subject,
Razor.

08:51.239 --> 08:52.573
Look, all you got to know

08:52.657 --> 08:54.909
is that Scoot got out of the way
in time.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.953
Heh.
I had it.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.996
Well, it's nice
to meet you guys.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.122
I'm Craig and this is --

09:00.206 --> 09:02.333
Wait a minute.
You're Craig?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.293
The one who saved the creek?!

09:04.377 --> 09:06.462
Yes.

09:06.462 --> 09:07.797
Yes, I am.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.132
You two
are bona fide heroes.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.803
And heroes need to be rewarded
for their good deeds and junk.

09:13.803 --> 09:15.680
Well,
helping is its own reward.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.181
Oh, you're already here.

09:17.265 --> 09:20.810
As a token of appreciation for
returning freedom to the creek

09:20.810 --> 09:23.896
and allowing us
to spin our wheels once again,

09:23.980 --> 09:26.774
I bestow upon you a relic
left to us

09:26.774 --> 09:29.986
by our "roll-scendants"
many summers ago.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.195
Wow.

09:31.279 --> 09:34.657
I'll always cherish it,
whatever it is.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.119
I think <i>I</i> know what it is!

09:38.119 --> 09:39.412
Kenneth's cube.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.998
This cube is one piece
of a whole puzzle

09:41.998 --> 09:43.332
that belonged to Kenneth,

09:43.416 --> 09:46.002
the first king of
the other side of the creek.

09:46.002 --> 09:48.045
26 pieces in total.

09:48.129 --> 09:50.923
Before he left, he scattered
them across the land --

09:51.007 --> 09:53.342
some entrusted
to his closest allies,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.469
others hidden
within the creek itself.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.346
When put together,
the puzzle cube

09:57.430 --> 09:59.473
apparently unlocks
some supersecret treasure

09:59.557 --> 10:01.851
called the Heart of the Forest.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.728
Whoaaa!

10:03.728 --> 10:06.355
Heart of the Forest?
What's that?

10:06.439 --> 10:07.690
No one knows.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.858
Oh, I-I can guess!

10:08.858 --> 10:10.234
All right,
just give me one hint.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.402
I literally don't know.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.654
Ooh!
That is a good hint.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.532
When Xavier was ruling,
it was impossible to look,

10:16.532 --> 10:19.285
but now that the other side
is free to explore...

10:19.285 --> 10:21.370
We could find them all!

10:21.454 --> 10:23.372
I smell
a treasure quest,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.541
and it reeks of glory!

10:25.625 --> 10:27.043
Aw, man,
I love treasure!

10:27.043 --> 10:31.505
'Tis no accident that "treasure"
and "pleasure" doth rhyme.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.883
Well,
one thing's for sure...

10:33.883 --> 10:38.262
Omar, my man, I think you got
what it takes to join my crew.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.889
So, what do you say?

10:39.889 --> 10:43.309
Want to be a part
of something big?

10:43.309 --> 10:44.644
Hmm.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.605
Let's do this.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.066
I love seeing
your forehead!

10:47.688 --> 10:50.066
Ponytail! Oh, can I --

10:50.066 --> 10:51.984
I don't have enough.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.236
Kelsey:
A new adventure begins.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.405
Craig: Man,
finding all those pieces,

10:56.489 --> 10:57.907
who knows how long
it'll take?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.284
I don't know.
Could take all season!

11:00.368 --> 11:02.328
Or at least
a couple weekends.

11:04.705 --> 11:07.583
♪ When it's time to go to bed ♪

11:07.583 --> 11:12.088
♪ I know
I don't have to feel alone ♪

11:12.088 --> 11:15.424
♪ 'Cause I'll see you tomorrow ♪

11:15.508 --> 11:16.759
♪ At the creek ♪

11:16.759 --> 11:19.387
Just like I drew it.
