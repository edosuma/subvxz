"The Affair"...

00:06.240 --> 00:07.593
You figured out
who her mother is yet?

00:07.661 --> 00:08.664
Think she
looks a little like

00:08.732 --> 00:10.062
Michelle Pfeiffer, 
you think?

00:10.154 --> 00:12.355
- Hi. Sierra, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:12.442 --> 00:14.742
- How's it going?
- Great, actually.

00:14.829 --> 00:16.393
If you ever wanted
a workout buddy

00:16.480 --> 00:17.661
or a drinking buddy,

00:17.748 --> 00:20.314
- I do both a lot, so...
- Hey, look.

00:21.956 --> 00:24.149
I think I've lost
like eight pounds.

00:24.236 --> 00:25.523
You really
didn't have to do this.

00:25.610 --> 00:26.659
It's like enough food
for a week.

00:26.746 --> 00:28.309
Vikram is very skinny.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.855
- I know.
- A husband should be fat.

00:30.994 --> 00:33.643
- It shows he's happy.
- Vik's happy.

00:33.730 --> 00:36.980
You know, I'm actually
starting to understand

00:37.067 --> 00:38.902
why people like L.A.

00:40.128 --> 00:41.546
What do you think about that?

00:43.335 --> 00:44.484
Vik?

00:46.575 --> 00:48.176
Why do none
of the other animals

00:48.263 --> 00:50.511
stand up to the tyrant Napoleon?

00:50.598 --> 00:51.736
Here, just read
the passage.

00:51.823 --> 00:53.258
I said no.

00:56.059 --> 00:57.157
Principal Wilson.

00:57.244 --> 00:58.404
Don't mind me.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.394
So, should I be
worried about Janelle?

01:00.481 --> 01:04.655
To be honest,
I think she's overcompensating.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.804
- Joel, what does "RD" mean?
- Anton?

01:06.891 --> 01:09.574
He was supposed
to graduate last spring.

01:09.661 --> 01:11.471
Plagiarized
in the second semester,

01:11.558 --> 01:14.064
so Janelle made
your predecessor fail him.

01:14.238 --> 01:15.729
I want to talk
about your essay.

01:16.005 --> 01:17.072
What about it?

01:17.159 --> 01:18.917
It's really, really good.

01:19.218 --> 01:20.825
So, what I want to know is...

01:20.912 --> 01:22.726
Who wrote
this brilliant essay?

01:22.813 --> 01:24.177
'Cause I don't think it was you.

01:24.264 --> 01:25.347
Fuck you.

02:48.090 --> 02:50.468
<i>All right,
so let me get this straight.</i>

02:51.073 --> 02:53.208
She was married to you,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.550
and then she cheated with you.

02:56.963 --> 02:59.951
And then she left you for you.

03:00.338 --> 03:02.950
And then she cheated
on you with you.

03:04.137 --> 03:05.846
And then she had
your baby,

03:06.573 --> 03:08.569
but then said
it was your baby.

03:09.361 --> 03:10.660
Did I get that right?

03:11.568 --> 03:12.926
Pretty much.

03:13.175 --> 03:14.403
Damn.

03:14.914 --> 03:16.201
White people crazy, man.

03:16.288 --> 03:17.455
That is some real

03:17.542 --> 03:19.621
Maury Povich shit right there.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.425
- Athena?
- <i>Hey, Cole.</i>

03:21.512 --> 03:23.236
Hey. What's the latest?

03:23.323 --> 03:24.877
<i>The police just came by.</i>

03:24.964 --> 03:26.571
<i>They said no sign
of forced entry.</i>

03:26.658 --> 03:28.181
<i>Her things are all still there.</i>

03:28.268 --> 03:30.033
<i>It looks like she just walked</i>

03:30.120 --> 03:31.856
<i>out of the house
and didn't come back.</i>

03:31.949 --> 03:33.662
Were they able
to unlock her phone?

03:33.749 --> 03:36.456
<i>No, but the cops
obtained her phone records.</i>

03:36.543 --> 03:38.178
Who's the last person
she called?

03:38.488 --> 03:40.396
<i>The last person
she called was Ben.</i>

03:40.743 --> 03:41.747
When?

03:41.869 --> 03:43.238
<i>Three days ago.</i>

03:45.702 --> 03:46.800
Have they
talked to him?

03:46.887 --> 03:49.467
<i>Yeah, but they won't tell me
exactly what he said.</i>

03:49.554 --> 03:52.054
<i>But apparently, he doesn't know
where she is, either.</i>

03:52.159 --> 03:53.947
All right, I'll talk
to him myself.

03:54.938 --> 03:56.054
<i>Where are you?</i>

03:56.141 --> 03:57.487
Somewhere
in Pennsylvania.

03:57.574 --> 03:59.452
I'm trying to get back
as quick as I can.

03:59.998 --> 04:01.802
I'll call you as soon
as we make New York.

04:01.889 --> 04:03.070
<i>Okay.</i>

04:05.622 --> 04:06.831
Who's Ben?

04:07.606 --> 04:09.056
The guy she's been seeing.

04:09.162 --> 04:10.510
Isn't he married?

04:12.778 --> 04:14.302
Girl's got a type.

04:18.964 --> 04:20.711
So he messed up.

04:20.798 --> 04:23.190
But don't we believe
in second chances?

04:23.282 --> 04:26.559
And if any of our kids deserves
a second chance, it's Alexis.

04:26.646 --> 04:27.802
Did you know that both

04:27.889 --> 04:29.293
of his parents are addicts?

04:29.380 --> 04:32.251
So you disapprove of how
I handled things with Alexis?

04:32.338 --> 04:33.568
No.

04:34.058 --> 04:35.720
I mean yes. I just...

04:35.807 --> 04:38.070
Alexis is a product
of his environment,

04:38.157 --> 04:40.030
and his actions reflect that.

04:40.117 --> 04:42.042
So we're basically
suspending him

04:42.129 --> 04:43.375
because of where
he comes from.

04:43.462 --> 04:44.832
Alexis wasn't suspended

04:44.919 --> 04:46.715
because of where
he comes from, Megan.

04:46.802 --> 04:50.288
He was suspended because he
set fire to a trash can

04:50.375 --> 04:52.057
in your algebra class.

04:53.355 --> 04:55.402
Anyone else have a student
they'd like to discuss?

04:55.489 --> 04:57.535
- We need to move on.
- We're not ready to move on.

04:57.603 --> 04:58.655
Oh?

04:58.723 --> 05:02.723
It's only October, and we're at
what already, eight suspensions?

05:02.817 --> 05:04.583
Look, Janelle,
when we heard

05:04.651 --> 05:05.942
that you were
coming over from Marshall,

05:06.010 --> 05:07.727
we were so excited
to have you here.

05:07.814 --> 05:11.252
I mean, that is
a tough school, but...

05:12.135 --> 05:14.667
since you've been here,
the culture of our little school

05:14.754 --> 05:15.795
has really changed.

05:15.863 --> 05:18.431
I mean, all of these rules
and these suspensions.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.533
Because right after
I got here, Megan, we took in

05:21.620 --> 05:23.506
students from
a failing school.

05:23.679 --> 05:25.227
Students no one else wanted
because of

05:25.314 --> 05:26.753
the discipline problems
they brought.

05:26.821 --> 05:28.413
I think what
Megan is trying to say

05:28.500 --> 05:31.390
is that you came in last year
pushing an agenda.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.498
You're a first-time principal
wanting to cause a splash.

05:34.585 --> 05:38.325
We gave your whole nonnegotiable
discipline policy a fair shake.

05:39.388 --> 05:42.147
It didn't work, and now it's
time to try something else.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.622
When I was at Stanford,
I took a whole class

05:44.709 --> 05:46.941
on restorative justice,
and we were thinking

05:47.028 --> 05:49.459
that I could lead a workshop
in talking circles.

05:49.546 --> 05:52.121
Restorative justice
has been a spectacular failure

05:52.208 --> 05:54.450
- in the LAUSD system.
- Well, Janelle,

05:54.537 --> 05:56.591
perhaps that's because
the LAUSD teachers

05:56.678 --> 05:58.004
aren't as committed
as we are to...

05:58.091 --> 05:59.343
Why is that, Joel?

05:59.430 --> 06:01.231
Because they're not
as white as you are?

06:01.318 --> 06:03.064
For God sakes, Kristina, enough.

06:03.151 --> 06:06.252
Listen. If y'all want to talk
about alternative discipline,

06:06.339 --> 06:07.845
we can have
that conversation.

06:08.126 --> 06:09.840
But let me ask you
a question.

06:10.079 --> 06:11.886
What would have happened
at your high schools

06:11.973 --> 06:14.149
if a kid had set fire
to a trash can?

06:16.071 --> 06:17.071
Right.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.235
So why are we gonna
ghettoize our students

06:19.322 --> 06:21.325
by tolerating behavior
that would never fly

06:21.412 --> 06:23.205
at a suburban white school?

06:23.330 --> 06:26.348
Are our expectations for them
really so low?

06:29.240 --> 06:32.538
Now, are there any other
students of concern

06:32.799 --> 06:34.008
we need to discuss?

06:34.095 --> 06:35.278
Uh, actually, yeah.

06:35.365 --> 06:36.527
I have, uh, a student

06:36.614 --> 06:38.861
in my AP English class
I'm worried about:

06:38.948 --> 06:40.326
Anton Gatewood.

06:40.426 --> 06:41.945
I think he may
be brilliant.

06:42.032 --> 06:43.473
He's a really
gifted writer,

06:43.560 --> 06:46.048
but he's angry,
he's beaten down.

06:46.684 --> 06:47.727
And I'm not sure what...

06:47.814 --> 06:49.250
what's going on
in his home life,

06:49.337 --> 06:50.608
but, uh...

06:50.725 --> 06:52.611
I just feel he's under
a lot of pressure.

06:52.698 --> 06:55.897
So I thought maybe we should all just
keep an eye on him.

06:56.510 --> 06:58.088
I get the sense
this kid could really

06:58.175 --> 06:59.563
do something with his life.

06:59.807 --> 07:02.214
Like you did, Mr. Solloway?

07:12.832 --> 07:15.042
Dude, that was spectacular.

07:15.129 --> 07:16.735
- What?
- Uh, this is why you're

07:16.822 --> 07:19.254
such a good writer, man.
The way you think is so twisted.

07:19.341 --> 07:20.467
What? I-I'm not
following.

07:20.554 --> 07:22.491
Bring up her own son
in morning meeting.

07:22.578 --> 07:23.676
That takes balls.

07:23.763 --> 07:25.158
I respect you.

07:25.370 --> 07:26.769
I wish I was you.

07:27.498 --> 07:28.498
Whose son?

07:28.607 --> 07:29.791
Janelle's.

07:30.514 --> 07:31.514
Wait.

07:32.044 --> 07:34.500
You-you telling me
Anton is Janelle's...

07:34.587 --> 07:35.644
Janelle's son.

07:35.712 --> 07:37.417
Yeah. You didn't know that?

07:37.778 --> 07:39.201
How would I know that?

07:39.288 --> 07:40.701
How would you not
know that?

07:40.788 --> 07:43.160
What, you go home and live
under a rock or something?

07:43.247 --> 07:44.558
- Fuck.
- Shit, man.

07:44.645 --> 07:46.111
I gotta take you out
for a drink,

07:46.198 --> 07:48.757
give you the lay of the
political landscape around here.

07:48.844 --> 07:50.918
Plus, I want to know
what you think of my book.

07:51.458 --> 07:55.083
Uh, uh, yeah, no, I-I'm not
quite done with it yet, but...

07:55.170 --> 07:56.696
Relax. I'm kidding.

07:56.783 --> 07:57.876
Sort of.

07:58.616 --> 07:59.982
Hey, don't sweat
the Anton stuff.

08:00.069 --> 08:02.412
You're 100% right, okay, man?
He's brilliant.

08:02.499 --> 08:03.908
Kid would be
at Princeton right now

08:03.995 --> 08:05.359
if it wasn't
for his mother.

08:05.947 --> 08:07.777
What do you mean?
I thought he plagiarized.

08:07.864 --> 08:09.760
Yeah, but that's not
a fail-able offense.

08:09.847 --> 08:11.620
At least not at this school.
We usually just

08:11.707 --> 08:12.994
give the kid
a stern talking-to,

08:13.081 --> 08:14.553
make him redo the paper.

08:15.148 --> 08:17.286
That is, until Madea
over there showed up

08:17.373 --> 08:19.813
and decided to make an example
out of her own son.

08:19.900 --> 08:20.983
Jesus.

08:26.650 --> 08:28.087
Oh, she hates me now.

08:28.209 --> 08:30.305
Don't worry.
She hates us all.

08:40.332 --> 08:42.054
I wanted to apologize.

08:50.098 --> 08:54.316
Obviously, I had no idea
that Anton was your son.

08:55.156 --> 08:56.488
You know I almost laughed

08:56.575 --> 08:59.676
when my board told me
I had to hire some ex-con?

09:00.604 --> 09:03.318
I mean, can you imagine
if you were black?

09:06.214 --> 09:07.337
But whatever.

09:07.424 --> 09:10.561
I get that it's good PR
to have some celebrity novelist

09:10.648 --> 09:13.066
slumming it with
all these poor kids.

09:14.337 --> 09:16.422
But do me a favor...
While you're here,

09:16.600 --> 09:19.700
please don't pretend
to be a real teacher.

09:23.043 --> 09:27.065
I-I am a novelist...
A pretty well-respected one...

09:27.152 --> 09:30.329
But before I sold a single book,
I was a teacher for a decade.

09:31.217 --> 09:32.606
A good one.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.936
I fought my ass off

09:36.270 --> 09:40.624
and went through months of
community service

09:40.711 --> 09:42.933
and counseling to be allowed
to teach again.

09:43.822 --> 09:45.547
I want to be here.

09:46.663 --> 09:49.081
And I'd also really like
to help Anton.

09:52.318 --> 09:54.189
You really want to help Anton?

09:56.063 --> 09:58.480
Leave him out of your next book.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.188
Okay.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.569
Let's get started, everyone.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.421
Quiet, please.

10:15.042 --> 10:18.050
Sharee, will you
sit down, please? Sharee!

10:18.137 --> 10:19.670
- Sharee, sit down, please, now.
- It-it's bullshit.

10:19.738 --> 10:21.239
- He didn't do nothing.
- I know! Man.

10:21.326 --> 10:22.597
Fuck's your problem?

10:26.145 --> 10:27.216
Okay.

10:27.303 --> 10:29.009
Quiet. Let's start.

10:29.478 --> 10:31.148
Let's get going!

10:32.441 --> 10:34.265
Jesus, mister, you crazy?

10:34.352 --> 10:36.028
Just ready to get going.

10:37.163 --> 10:38.399
Anybody seen Jaime?

10:38.486 --> 10:40.824
That's what I've been saying.
He got suspended.

10:41.086 --> 10:43.294
Don't you think
it's bullshit, mister?

10:44.651 --> 10:47.383
Uh, depends on what
he was doing.

10:47.470 --> 10:48.813
He cussed out
Mr. Nance.

10:48.900 --> 10:51.225
But Mr. Nance was being
a dick, Mr. Solloway.

10:51.312 --> 10:53.324
Why they gotta suspend him
just for that?

10:53.411 --> 10:55.593
People who run this school
is crazy.

10:56.171 --> 10:57.975
All right,
take it easy, Carlos.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.450
Hate to see you
get suspended, too.

11:00.763 --> 11:02.978
Right, today we're going
to start a new unit:

11:03.065 --> 11:04.628
The Waste Land.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.095
So, everybody,
look down on your desks.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.670
Tell me what you see.

11:10.528 --> 11:11.903
Looks like a book to me.

11:11.990 --> 11:13.378
Great. A book.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.574
Yep.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.328
What else?

11:20.901 --> 11:22.031
Come on.

11:23.263 --> 11:24.205
Anybody.

11:24.292 --> 11:26.803
Blanca, what do you see?

11:26.905 --> 11:28.348
I don't know, mister.

11:28.582 --> 11:30.259
Creepy old white dude?

11:30.393 --> 11:32.233
Are you talking
about Mr. Solloway

11:32.320 --> 11:33.979
or the guy on the cover?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.374
"Creepy old white dude."

11:42.770 --> 11:44.223
Okay, let's go deeper.

11:44.310 --> 11:46.671
This is what is called
"previewing."

11:46.983 --> 11:48.910
It's making
intelligent predictions

11:48.997 --> 11:52.374
about what a book is about
based on first impressions.

11:52.983 --> 11:54.072
So flip through your books,

11:54.159 --> 11:57.032
and based on the language
and the images you see,

11:57.251 --> 11:59.219
tell me what you think
it's gonna be about.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.805
A poem about something boring.

12:03.894 --> 12:05.439
"Something boring."

12:06.388 --> 12:07.841
- What else?
- Wait.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.613
Look, y'all. It says
right here "ejaculations."

12:10.985 --> 12:12.675
Something about...

12:13.046 --> 12:15.343
"impious ejaculations."

12:16.893 --> 12:19.778
I officially predict
this is gonna be a porno.

12:22.202 --> 12:23.243
Okay.

12:27.165 --> 12:29.970
Okay, so we think
The Waste Land may be a porno.

12:30.415 --> 12:31.415
What else?

12:33.313 --> 12:34.472
Come on, anybody.

12:35.715 --> 12:37.140
Anton, what do you think?

12:40.347 --> 12:44.071
Pretty sure it's another book
by another dead white guy

12:44.158 --> 12:46.040
that ain't got shit
to do with us.

12:46.205 --> 12:48.347
Okay, so we've already
established that The Waste Land

12:48.415 --> 12:49.574
was written by
a creepy old white dude.

12:49.642 --> 12:51.673
Why are you so sure
that this

12:51.760 --> 12:53.737
is completely irrelevant
to your lives?

12:53.824 --> 12:55.079
How's it trying to hide it?

12:55.222 --> 12:57.386
It says right there
in the dude's bio

12:57.619 --> 13:00.115
one of his major themes
is nostalgia.

13:00.582 --> 13:02.881
All about him wanting
to go back to the past,

13:02.968 --> 13:04.036
when life was better.

13:04.123 --> 13:06.298
Make America great again,
bitches.

13:06.713 --> 13:07.713
Right.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.893
Exactly.

13:09.018 --> 13:10.379
When life was better for who?

13:11.532 --> 13:13.895
What I want to know,
Mr. Solloway,

13:14.789 --> 13:16.911
is why the hell we're
reading this shit anyways.

13:18.575 --> 13:19.617
Okay.

13:23.180 --> 13:25.954
Well, so...
so who should we be reading?

13:26.246 --> 13:28.306
I don't know.
James Baldwin.

13:28.393 --> 13:30.490
Borges.
Octavia Butler.

13:30.707 --> 13:32.686
Junot Diaz.
Ta-Nehisi Coates.

13:32.773 --> 13:34.665
Cornel West.
I'll keep going.

13:34.752 --> 13:36.261
Cornel West.

13:36.658 --> 13:38.375
Guess where he teaches.

13:40.885 --> 13:42.123
Princeton.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.417
So, the first time
I read The Waste Land,

13:47.504 --> 13:48.790
I was in college.

13:49.713 --> 13:52.360
And I could tell
it was brilliant, but...

13:53.212 --> 13:55.495
I couldn't understand
what it was actually about.

13:55.582 --> 13:57.060
It was like reading
a foreign language.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.836
Completely kicked my ass.

13:58.989 --> 14:02.157
But everyone else
in my freshman lit seminar

14:02.244 --> 14:03.821
had read it already.

14:03.955 --> 14:05.766
They could speak this language.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.821
And so the whole time
we were discussing this book,

14:08.908 --> 14:10.383
I was silent.

14:10.525 --> 14:12.469
I was too scared
to speak up.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.123
So, one of the reasons

14:15.210 --> 14:16.506
why you should read
The Waste Land

14:16.593 --> 14:18.839
is so that when you go
to college,

14:21.361 --> 14:23.000
you'll be better prepared
than I was.

14:23.555 --> 14:24.985
Yeah, man,
but why I gotta worry

14:25.072 --> 14:26.625
about meeting them
on their field?

14:26.712 --> 14:29.110
How about they worry about
being welcome on mine?

14:29.344 --> 14:31.672
Because they won't, Anton.

14:33.084 --> 14:35.711
That's just not the way
the world works.

14:36.017 --> 14:37.180
That's bullshit.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.789
I agree with you.

14:39.744 --> 14:41.789
So come on,
what can you do about it?

14:42.485 --> 14:43.679
I guess nothing.

14:43.825 --> 14:44.954
Why not?

14:45.282 --> 14:46.844
I don't know.

14:46.931 --> 14:48.832
What can I do about it?
You tell me.

14:48.919 --> 14:51.032
Well, if you want to be heard,
you gotta speak.

14:51.837 --> 14:54.469
You can't just sit at the back
of the class, scowling,

14:54.821 --> 14:57.571
with your head in a hoodie,
and think things will change.

14:58.041 --> 15:02.305
Dawg, if we speak,
Anton's mommy will suspend us.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.703
Nah, Eduardo,

15:03.790 --> 15:05.595
she'll just suspend your ass
for being ugly.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.354
Fucking ugly ass.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.524
Well, she can't
suspend all of you.

15:10.985 --> 15:12.578
What are you saying?

15:13.359 --> 15:15.569
I'm just saying...

15:15.849 --> 15:17.485
collectively...

15:18.845 --> 15:21.430
you're not as powerless
as you think you are.

15:34.382 --> 15:35.839
Yo, Anton.

15:36.329 --> 15:37.875
Where you going?

15:38.157 --> 15:39.835
It's a walkout, y'all.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.430
Come on.

16:03.457 --> 16:05.583
Hey, we got rights, too, man!

16:12.248 --> 16:13.828
Walkout! Walkout!

16:13.915 --> 16:16.313
Walkout! Walkout! Walkout!

16:18.707 --> 16:20.815
Walkout! Walkout! Walkout!

16:20.902 --> 16:22.393
Hold it!

16:22.571 --> 16:26.127
Everyone get back to their
classrooms right now!

16:26.214 --> 16:28.479
Anyone who
does not go back

16:28.566 --> 16:30.834
to their classrooms
risks suspension!

16:30.921 --> 16:33.173
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

16:33.260 --> 16:34.463
This is bad.

16:34.550 --> 16:36.203
This is really
fucking bad.

16:36.290 --> 16:37.844
They're heading
into the street.

16:37.931 --> 16:39.620
Get back to your rooms!

16:39.860 --> 16:41.917
Get back to your room!

16:42.646 --> 16:44.788
Can we lock these doors somehow?

16:44.875 --> 16:47.086
No, no, we're not
locking anything.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.510
This behavior
is unacceptable!

16:49.597 --> 16:51.578
Get back to
your classrooms!

16:51.665 --> 16:53.831
Janelle, we can't
just let them all leave.

16:53.918 --> 16:54.943
Fuck.

16:55.011 --> 16:56.083
Okay, lock it down.

16:56.170 --> 16:58.662
- Lockdown!
- Okay, it's locked.

16:58.749 --> 17:00.510
All teachers, please
begin lockdown procedures.

17:00.597 --> 17:02.237
You can't get out.
You can't get out.

17:02.324 --> 17:03.528
Lock it down!

17:03.615 --> 17:05.026
Lock it down!

17:05.122 --> 17:06.749

It's time to get back.

17:20.762 --> 17:22.659
Get back inside,
everyone.

17:22.746 --> 17:24.425
You made your point.

17:24.512 --> 17:26.498
Everyone needs
to get back inside, okay?

17:26.585 --> 17:27.625
The cops are here.

17:27.712 --> 17:28.834
You made your point.

17:47.001 --> 17:49.023
Back inside. Get back.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.605
No, get back!

17:51.290 --> 17:52.328
Anton!

17:52.415 --> 17:53.787
You stay back. You stay back!

17:53.874 --> 17:55.000
- Stay there!
- These are children, Officer!

17:55.087 --> 17:56.113
- A misunderstanding.
- Ma'am...

17:56.200 --> 17:57.220
you need to step back.

17:57.307 --> 17:58.533
Please! He is a child!

17:58.620 --> 18:00.428
Ma'am, I said step back.

18:00.515 --> 18:02.178
Come on.
These are children, man.

18:02.265 --> 18:03.438
This is just a misunderstanding.

18:03.525 --> 18:04.892
What are we doing here?

18:04.988 --> 18:07.243
Come on, look.
What are we doing here?

18:07.940 --> 18:09.694
- Get your hands off him!
- Get back.

18:09.781 --> 18:12.454
Come on, how could this possibly
end well for any of us?

18:12.838 --> 18:15.458
Look.
They got cameras.

18:18.123 --> 18:19.908
Fuck the police!

18:19.995 --> 18:21.996
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

18:22.105 --> 18:23.249
Let him up.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.531
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

18:25.618 --> 18:28.073
- Get up.
- Quiet!

18:28.199 --> 18:30.874
Fuck the police!
Fuck the police!

18:30.961 --> 18:31.946
Angel.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.532
Get over here.
Get over here.

18:33.619 --> 18:35.333
Get back there.

18:37.462 --> 18:38.962
Thank you.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.264
But your students
are clearly angry.

18:43.351 --> 18:45.295
- They're protesting.
- Come on. Let's go.

18:45.382 --> 18:47.256
Look, of course
we'll have conversations

18:47.343 --> 18:49.074
about what led
to today's events,

18:49.161 --> 18:50.434
but these are teenagers.

18:50.521 --> 18:51.850
They're acting out.

18:52.086 --> 18:53.647
You're a new
principal, right?

18:53.734 --> 18:56.911
Is this protest a referendum
on how you're running things?

18:56.998 --> 18:58.311
We spoke to
another teacher

18:58.398 --> 19:00.024
who said there's been
some conflict over

19:00.111 --> 19:01.875
your disciplinary
practices.

19:02.096 --> 19:03.787
As I said, we...

19:03.874 --> 19:07.166
are just grateful that things
were handled quickly.

19:07.253 --> 19:09.286
Uh, no one was hurt. Um...

19:09.373 --> 19:11.428
You're grateful for the police.
Is that what you're saying?

19:11.515 --> 19:12.600
I'm sorry.

19:12.687 --> 19:14.280
Sorry, yeah, I'm a teacher here,

19:14.367 --> 19:17.501
and, uh, things have gotten
out of control here today,

19:17.588 --> 19:19.242
but we're really proud
of our students.

19:19.329 --> 19:22.735
They staged a walkout
to express their opinions

19:22.822 --> 19:25.119
about the content of
the curriculum. Now, come on.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.234
How-how often do you hear
high school students

19:27.321 --> 19:30.040
caring that much about
what they're reading in class

19:30.206 --> 19:31.946
that they stage a protest?

19:32.540 --> 19:34.750
So, this was
school-sanctioned, Mister...?

19:34.837 --> 19:37.165
Uh, Solloway.

19:37.252 --> 19:39.514
Um... yeah.

19:39.601 --> 19:41.752
Yeah, that's what
Compton Academy's all about.

19:41.839 --> 19:43.376
You know,
we try to raise...

19:43.463 --> 19:48.078
and create engaged students
and-and-and responsible citizens

19:48.165 --> 19:49.829
to lead the next
generation.

19:49.930 --> 19:52.244
So, Mr. Solloway,
what can you tell us

19:52.331 --> 19:54.874
about the specifics
of the students' demands?

19:54.961 --> 19:57.994
Well, they, uh...
they weren't too specific,

19:58.081 --> 20:00.036
but essentially,
they want a-a...

20:00.123 --> 20:01.583
a more inclusive curriculum.

20:01.947 --> 20:03.626
There was fucking
riot police, Helen.

20:03.713 --> 20:04.970
What was I supposed to do?

20:05.057 --> 20:07.137
Yes, I'm still coming over.

20:08.571 --> 20:10.235
It's saying an hour 20.

20:11.391 --> 20:13.728
Fine, they just eat late.
Who cares?

20:15.454 --> 20:16.768
Okay, fine.

20:16.855 --> 20:18.444
I don't teach till ten tomorrow.

20:18.531 --> 20:20.986
I'll come over,
and I'll take them to school.

20:21.415 --> 20:22.860
Well, if that's
the only fucking way

20:22.947 --> 20:24.548
I'm gonna see
my own kids, Helen,

20:24.635 --> 20:26.431
then I don't mind driving.

20:26.978 --> 20:28.417
Thanks. Yeah, thanks a lot.

20:28.504 --> 20:29.946
That's really generous.

20:30.416 --> 20:32.194
Bunch of us are heading
to this bar over

20:32.281 --> 20:33.421
- in Inglewood...
- Yes.

20:33.508 --> 20:34.921
Awesome, dude.

20:35.008 --> 20:36.275
It's kind of
a divey place.

20:36.362 --> 20:38.217
Hey, when you say "us,"
do you mean just the teachers

20:38.304 --> 20:40.051
- or the administrators, too?
- Not to worry.

20:40.138 --> 20:42.298
She never comes slumming
with us plebes.

20:45.823 --> 20:47.369
With something like this,

20:47.600 --> 20:49.250
the police presence
and everything,

20:49.337 --> 20:51.414
there is zero chance
she doesn't get fired.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.640
We'll see. There's still
a lot of people on that board

20:53.727 --> 20:55.890
- who really love her.
- Oh, not after today.

20:55.977 --> 20:57.627
They're finally gonna realize
they should have

20:57.714 --> 21:00.064
promoted you in the first place.

21:01.209 --> 21:02.819
I thought she did
pretty fucking well.

21:02.906 --> 21:03.984
Shh!

21:04.185 --> 21:05.978
Hey, look, it's on TV.

21:10.612 --> 21:13.286
The variety that we see in the
student body being reflected

21:13.373 --> 21:14.554
in the curriculum,
that's what they really...

21:14.641 --> 21:16.109
Well done, dude.

21:16.196 --> 21:18.198
Did I say I was principal?

21:18.460 --> 21:20.790
Congratulations
on your promotion.

21:21.774 --> 21:22.947
Janelle.

21:23.068 --> 21:25.112
What's everybody drinking?

21:25.374 --> 21:27.220
Y'all were great today.

21:27.549 --> 21:29.095
Let me buy
the next round.

21:29.901 --> 21:32.697
Uh, you know, Janelle,
I think we're okay.

21:32.784 --> 21:34.460
Joel just got us
another round,

21:34.547 --> 21:36.345
and tomorrow's
a school day, so...

21:36.541 --> 21:38.485
Very responsible.

21:39.245 --> 21:42.345
Okay, well,
if you change your minds...

21:42.869 --> 21:44.371
let me know.

21:49.065 --> 21:51.361
I thought you said
she never came.

21:51.582 --> 21:53.900
I guess she needed a drink.

22:02.334 --> 22:03.875
Excuse me.

22:06.915 --> 22:09.171
Is anybody
buying you a drink?

22:09.531 --> 22:12.234
I took care of myself.
Thank you.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.532
Hey.

22:17.055 --> 22:19.710
I wanted to apologize again.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.188
For what?

22:22.636 --> 22:25.013
Usurping my title?

22:25.600 --> 22:26.815
What can I get you?

22:26.902 --> 22:28.492
Uh, whatever
she's having.

22:28.635 --> 22:30.804
Whiskey, Jameson. Two?

22:31.013 --> 22:32.682
No, just, uh...
another one for her

22:32.804 --> 22:33.992
and a seltzer.

22:34.446 --> 22:35.956
Thanks.

22:37.081 --> 22:38.859
I was just
trying to help.

22:40.539 --> 22:42.271
I wasn't asking for your help.

22:42.358 --> 22:43.771
I had it under control.

22:44.562 --> 22:45.963
You did?

22:47.727 --> 22:49.075
Same card
you've been using?

22:49.162 --> 22:52.023
Uh... no, baby.

22:52.590 --> 22:55.007
Uh, this next round's
on my friend.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.640
And pour yourself
something nice.

22:57.727 --> 22:59.041
On him, too.

22:59.133 --> 23:00.578
Keep the change.

23:02.422 --> 23:04.710
You know, you don't have
to sit here and babysit me.

23:04.797 --> 23:06.542
You can go back to your friends.

23:09.790 --> 23:11.789
I'm not sure I can, actually.

23:12.485 --> 23:14.086
Maybe not.

23:15.553 --> 23:17.023
And they're not my friends.

23:17.110 --> 23:18.273
Mine, either.

23:19.688 --> 23:21.697
This is all gonna blow over,
you know that?

23:21.784 --> 23:23.118
You think?

23:23.776 --> 23:26.075
I was on the phone
all afternoon with the board,

23:26.162 --> 23:27.796
fighting to keep my job.

23:28.465 --> 23:30.302
Then I come here to mend fences,

23:30.389 --> 23:32.804
and most of my staff

23:32.891 --> 23:35.109
won't even let me
buy them a drink.

23:38.169 --> 23:42.023
And then I... when I think about
what could have happened today,

23:42.440 --> 23:44.968
how badly it could have gone...

23:49.080 --> 23:52.016
So, tell me, how is this
all gonna blow over?

23:54.509 --> 23:56.430
Here's the thing
with your staff.

23:56.542 --> 23:57.710
They're young.

23:57.797 --> 23:58.928
They're children.

23:59.015 --> 24:00.134
Right.

24:00.779 --> 24:03.282
And like children,
they want to be listened to.

24:03.639 --> 24:05.243
They want to feel heard.

24:06.084 --> 24:09.828
And sometimes, in your...

24:10.353 --> 24:13.318
staff meetings, you seem like

24:13.405 --> 24:15.018
you don't really value
their opinions.

24:15.105 --> 24:16.225
I don't.

24:16.522 --> 24:17.898
Well, they know that.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.477
That's why they hate you.

24:19.775 --> 24:21.306
Wow.

24:21.524 --> 24:24.118
You really don't
need this job, do you?

24:29.181 --> 24:31.489
You know, at my
old school, Marshall,

24:31.576 --> 24:33.039
I was beloved.

24:34.087 --> 24:35.789
Like, seriously.

24:36.900 --> 24:40.282
Students fighting
to have lunch in my office,

24:40.657 --> 24:42.889
girls coming in to cry

24:42.976 --> 24:45.978
over whatever fool
was breaking their hearts.

24:47.133 --> 24:48.827
I'd do this Beyoncé thing

24:48.914 --> 24:51.469
every year at homecoming
that slayed.

24:51.736 --> 24:53.290
I'm sure.

24:55.628 --> 25:00.071
But when this job opened up,
I fought my ass off for it.

25:00.519 --> 25:02.719
At a public school
like Marshall,

25:02.824 --> 25:05.282
real progress is impossible.

25:05.498 --> 25:07.292
But at a charter,
you have autonomy.

25:07.379 --> 25:08.782
You set the agenda.

25:09.005 --> 25:10.774
I thought to myself,
here's my chance

25:10.861 --> 25:12.235
to actually make a difference

25:12.322 --> 25:13.961
with the kids
nobody else wanted.

25:14.384 --> 25:16.868
You know what happens
at a school like Marshall?

25:17.441 --> 25:19.102
They take in these kids,

25:19.189 --> 25:21.389
they keep them
till the fall census,

25:21.476 --> 25:23.254
they collect money
from the state,

25:23.341 --> 25:25.493
and then they dump
their sorry asses.

25:25.993 --> 25:27.349
They don't suspend.

25:27.436 --> 25:28.681
They expel.

25:29.462 --> 25:32.883
Those are the kids we picked up
at Compton Academy this year.

25:34.974 --> 25:36.446
And you know what?

25:36.563 --> 25:39.149
They need some
fucking discipline.

25:40.861 --> 25:42.100
And you know what else?

25:42.187 --> 25:43.657
If I were a white guy...

25:43.771 --> 25:45.341
if I were you, Noah Solloway,

25:45.428 --> 25:48.078
with your... with your looks
and your credentials,

25:48.857 --> 25:50.607
nobody would
give a shit about

25:50.694 --> 25:52.639
my disciplinary
practices.

25:52.726 --> 25:55.936
They would congratulate me
for having balls.

25:56.290 --> 25:57.814
But because I'm me,

25:57.901 --> 26:01.689
I'm expected to be
collaborative.

26:02.749 --> 26:04.360
And if I'm not...

26:04.447 --> 26:07.208
if I dare to say

26:07.924 --> 26:10.157
I have 20 fucking years

26:10.244 --> 26:12.275
of experience
in this business...

26:12.758 --> 26:15.595
I was teaching
when most of you

26:15.682 --> 26:16.788
were in driver's ed,

26:16.875 --> 26:19.751
so maybe... just maybe
I actually know

26:19.838 --> 26:21.478
what the fuck I'm doing.

26:26.375 --> 26:27.751
How's Anton?

26:27.963 --> 26:29.915
Is he okay after today?

26:30.516 --> 26:31.971
I hope so.

26:32.420 --> 26:34.103
He's with his dad.

26:35.803 --> 26:37.888
Yeah, mine are with their mom.

26:38.081 --> 26:39.225
You have kids?

26:39.312 --> 26:40.349
Mmm.

26:40.644 --> 26:42.407
Two boys, two girls.

26:42.574 --> 26:44.251
Damn, you're busy.

26:44.956 --> 26:47.125
Well, the older ones
are away at school now,

26:47.212 --> 26:50.055
and the... the younger two,
they live with my ex.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.556
That's why I'm in L.A.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.030
She came out with her boyfriend.

26:53.117 --> 26:54.501
I followed.

26:54.722 --> 26:56.458
I don't have much
of a relationship

26:56.545 --> 27:00.157
with them right now,
but I'm trying.

27:00.795 --> 27:02.478
Divorce is tough.

27:03.705 --> 27:04.830
Yeah.

27:09.846 --> 27:11.500
Can I ask you
something?

27:12.243 --> 27:14.728
Is it true
you failed your own kid?

27:15.998 --> 27:17.229
No.

27:17.516 --> 27:20.181
He plagiarized.
He failed himself.

27:20.346 --> 27:22.275
What was I
supposed to do?

27:23.040 --> 27:24.572
Let it go?

27:25.774 --> 27:27.282
It killed me to do it.

27:27.369 --> 27:28.821
I bet it did.

27:31.637 --> 27:35.640
The walkout today,
did it start in your classroom?

27:36.399 --> 27:37.462
How'd you...

27:37.549 --> 27:41.064
'Cause it's my school, Noah,
and I'm good at my job.

27:42.273 --> 27:44.243
But tell me, was it Anton?

27:44.816 --> 27:46.587
Did he instigate it?

27:48.884 --> 27:50.642
Why would you think that?

27:52.176 --> 27:53.944
That boy is turning
into his father,

27:54.031 --> 27:56.845
and there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.

27:58.924 --> 28:01.666
His dad used to be
an activist.

28:02.081 --> 28:05.336
But nowadays he uses
his extensive knowledge

28:05.423 --> 28:08.745
of Marx and Malcolm X
as foreplay

28:08.832 --> 28:11.682
to get much younger
white women into bed.

28:13.290 --> 28:15.885
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:36.936 --> 28:38.561
What?

28:50.071 --> 28:52.613
No, no.

28:52.735 --> 28:54.591
No, no, no, no, no.

28:54.678 --> 28:56.906
I'm... I'm your boss.

28:57.143 --> 29:00.851
I'm your boss. I'm your boss.

29:03.388 --> 29:05.763
Okay.

29:37.749 --> 29:40.013
Okay, so it's
not gallstones.

29:52.545 --> 29:54.287
So now we know.

30:01.857 --> 30:04.099
I think we should
go back to New York.

30:04.247 --> 30:06.534
And you must know somebody
at Sloan Kettering.

30:06.621 --> 30:08.284
And we can get
an appointment right away.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.919
I-I-I think we should
still get a second opinion.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.044
How are you feeling?

30:28.868 --> 30:31.117
I don't know how
to do this, man.

30:31.354 --> 30:33.647
I don't have a fucking clue.

30:39.676 --> 30:42.223
I'm sorry.
Um.

30:44.279 --> 30:47.012
I will get my shit together.

30:54.388 --> 30:55.653
You...

30:55.740 --> 30:57.416
I'm here, Vik.

30:57.503 --> 30:59.671
Okay, and we can
fight this thing.

31:01.482 --> 31:02.817
You and me.

31:03.063 --> 31:04.224
Together.

31:06.869 --> 31:08.341
Helen...

31:14.258 --> 31:16.161
Can you just drive?

31:31.860 --> 31:33.102
Mom.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.725
Hi.

31:35.532 --> 31:37.929
- What's up, hon?
- Where were you guys?

31:38.172 --> 31:39.516
Um...

31:40.707 --> 31:43.085
we were at an
early-morning yoga class.

31:43.977 --> 31:45.742
What happened?

31:46.332 --> 31:47.805
I just...

31:48.207 --> 31:51.203
Mom, did you ever read
Anne Frank before?

31:51.508 --> 31:54.742
Yeah, I-I think I read it
in junior high.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.778
We're reading it in English,
and I-I just can't...

31:57.865 --> 32:00.841
I can't stop thinking about it.
I mean, six million Jews.

32:00.928 --> 32:02.417
- Oh, Stacey.
- And they didn't just

32:02.504 --> 32:04.505
kill the Jews.
They killed the gay people,

32:04.592 --> 32:06.125
disabled people,
Russian people.

32:06.212 --> 32:07.239
They killed them all.

32:07.326 --> 32:09.005
- Stace.
- And then they had these ovens

32:09.092 --> 32:10.303
where they put them...
Even kids.

32:10.390 --> 32:11.540
Stacey!

32:11.829 --> 32:13.419
What, Mom?
This is important.

32:13.506 --> 32:16.140
So is school. Five minutes.
Go get your stuff.

32:20.005 --> 32:21.960
Trevor, you too.
You heard me.

32:23.248 --> 32:24.872
- Trev.
- One sec.

32:24.959 --> 32:26.867
I'm just finishing
human bio.

32:27.563 --> 32:30.000
And I'm done.

32:30.291 --> 32:32.960
I think I must have gotten
the science gene from Vik.

32:34.626 --> 32:37.190
Well, I'm not sure you did,

32:37.277 --> 32:38.950
if you think that's
how genetics works.

32:39.037 --> 32:41.429
Hey, nature versus nurture, Mom.

32:41.548 --> 32:44.437
Hey, Vik, do you want
some eggs or something?

32:45.540 --> 32:47.281
No. I'm gonna be late for work.

33:02.089 --> 33:03.906
Have a good day, you guys.

33:22.722 --> 33:23.929
What's wrong?

33:24.016 --> 33:25.149
What?

33:26.081 --> 33:27.476
You have that look.

33:27.563 --> 33:30.148
Uh... what are you doing here?

33:30.582 --> 33:32.609
I said I'd come to get the kids

33:32.696 --> 33:33.750
'cause I missed dinner
with them last night

33:33.837 --> 33:35.406
and I have two free
periods this morning.

33:35.493 --> 33:36.493
Remember?

33:36.998 --> 33:38.458
We talked about this
12 hours ago.

33:38.545 --> 33:39.692
Right. Yeah.

33:39.779 --> 33:40.888
I'm sorry. I guess, uh...

33:40.975 --> 33:42.877
Hey, kids, your dad's here.

33:42.964 --> 33:44.226
Be right there.

33:59.128 --> 34:00.837
- They gone?
- Yeah.

34:01.054 --> 34:03.182
So maybe we can talk
for a few minutes?

34:03.950 --> 34:05.214
Vik.

34:07.582 --> 34:08.956
Uh...

34:10.659 --> 34:12.275
Don't you want to?

34:23.373 --> 34:24.732
Wait.

34:25.581 --> 34:27.310
Okay.

35:01.662 --> 35:03.059
Wait. Don't go.

35:21.797 --> 35:23.232
Do you think it's
such a great idea

35:23.319 --> 35:24.546
to go into work
this morning?

35:24.633 --> 35:26.632
I have surgery at noon.

35:27.891 --> 35:29.646
I probably won't
finish everything

35:29.733 --> 35:31.679
until about seven-ish, so...

35:32.125 --> 35:34.781
you should just take an Uber
and meet me at the hotel.

35:35.304 --> 35:36.523
What?

35:37.180 --> 35:38.180
The gala.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.438
Oh.

35:40.673 --> 35:42.271
Do you think that maybe
we could skip that?

35:42.358 --> 35:43.466
Do you really want to sit

35:43.553 --> 35:44.778
through something
like that tonight?

35:44.865 --> 35:47.187
I can't skip it, Helen.
I'm being honored.

35:49.555 --> 35:50.879
Oh, can you
call my parents,

35:50.966 --> 35:52.134
make sure
they know where to go?

35:52.221 --> 35:53.835
They always get lost
downtown.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.510
Tell them to valet,
not to be stubborn.

35:56.597 --> 35:58.507
They'll never
find a spot.

36:03.132 --> 36:04.500
Don't tell them anything

36:04.587 --> 36:05.734
about this morning.

36:06.805 --> 36:08.585
This event means
a lot to them.

36:08.816 --> 36:10.398
You have to promise me.

36:11.416 --> 36:14.929
I... uh, I, uh...
I don't know.

36:15.016 --> 36:16.575
If you're not gonna
keep your mouth shut,

36:16.662 --> 36:18.340
then please don't come.

36:29.152 --> 36:30.363
Vik, wait.

36:30.891 --> 36:31.956
Vik.

36:32.238 --> 36:33.940
Oh, come on.

36:34.805 --> 36:36.144
Come on!

36:37.352 --> 36:38.787
Vik, this is
ridiculous.

36:38.874 --> 36:40.500
Vik, you have
to talk to me.

36:41.248 --> 36:43.049
- Motherfucker.
- Helen.

36:43.441 --> 36:45.070
Helen? You okay?

36:45.157 --> 36:46.263
Oh, my God, Helen.

36:46.350 --> 36:48.018
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36:48.149 --> 36:50.893
I am... I am
so, so sorry.

36:50.980 --> 36:52.911
It's just, this
garbage truck schedule

36:52.998 --> 36:54.584
is literally impossible
to keep straight.

36:54.671 --> 36:57.588
But that is no excuse
for almost maiming you.

36:57.675 --> 36:58.836
Are you sure you're okay?

36:58.923 --> 37:00.169
Don't worry about it.

37:00.339 --> 37:01.463
She's fine.

37:01.550 --> 37:02.584
- Right, Helen?
- Mm-hmm.

37:02.671 --> 37:04.188
Okay, well,
then maybe this is

37:04.275 --> 37:06.901
actually kismet, because
I was gonna come by anyway

37:06.988 --> 37:09.496
and invite you
to something really special.

37:09.583 --> 37:12.207
Uh, next month,
I am going to Joshua Tree

37:12.294 --> 37:14.411
with some friends,
and we go out there

37:14.498 --> 37:16.456
a couple times a year
to do a moon circle.

37:16.543 --> 37:18.914
Because, you know,
the-the autumn harvest moon

37:19.001 --> 37:22.453
is a time to really
open yourself up

37:22.540 --> 37:24.182
to integrative healing.

37:24.269 --> 37:25.573
And everyone is invited

37:25.660 --> 37:27.688
to bring her own
crystal to cleanse

37:27.775 --> 37:30.104
because, you guys, the best
way to cleanse a crystal

37:30.191 --> 37:32.237
is to leave it out
under a full moon.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.956
So... it's BYOC.

37:39.077 --> 37:40.797
Yes. Yes, totally.

37:40.884 --> 37:42.559
It's totally BYOC.

37:42.646 --> 37:43.802
So, do you want to come?

37:43.889 --> 37:45.538
I totally, totally don't.

37:46.938 --> 37:48.444
- Oh, okay.
- Okay?

37:48.531 --> 37:49.921
Cool. Cool.

37:50.008 --> 37:51.762
Um, well, it's not
for a few weeks,

37:51.849 --> 37:53.749
so maybe you can
just think about it.

38:13.517 --> 38:14.373
That was bitchy.

38:14.460 --> 38:15.844
Well, it needed
to be done.

38:15.931 --> 38:17.618
Clearly, I am having
a hard time

38:17.705 --> 38:19.232
finding the right way
to talk to you

38:19.319 --> 38:20.711
about this right now,
but can we please just

38:20.798 --> 38:22.397
- go sit down and talk?
- I'm going to work.

38:22.484 --> 38:23.524
We need to make
a treatment plan.

38:23.611 --> 38:26.180
Look, I know this is hard,
but come on.

38:28.856 --> 38:30.633
I'm not getting treatment.

38:33.813 --> 38:35.352
That's absurd.

38:36.696 --> 38:38.264
You can't not get treatment.

38:38.351 --> 38:40.397
Yes, I can... not.

38:40.484 --> 38:42.686
No, you can't.
That just doesn't make any sense.

38:42.773 --> 38:45.204
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch you die.

38:46.407 --> 38:48.110
Believe it or not, Helen,

38:48.483 --> 38:50.555
you don't get
to make that choice.

38:53.579 --> 38:55.243
Look... maybe you're in

38:55.330 --> 38:58.086
some kind of state of shock
or something, but I just...

38:58.173 --> 39:00.193
please, can we
please make a plan?

39:00.280 --> 39:02.368
- Okay.
- Thank you.

39:06.188 --> 39:07.563
Let's have a baby.

39:09.897 --> 39:11.329
How's that for a plan?

39:33.595 --> 39:35.258
Is he lashing out?

39:36.306 --> 39:38.586
Do you think he's
trying to punish me?

39:39.467 --> 39:40.634
Do you?

39:42.814 --> 39:44.459
Maybe he's asking me to do this

39:44.546 --> 39:46.485
because he wants me
to disappoint him.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.818
Why would Vik want you
to disappoint him?

39:48.905 --> 39:50.389
Because it's easier
to be mad at me

39:50.476 --> 39:51.961
than at his prognosis.

39:53.251 --> 39:54.915
That makes sense.

39:55.736 --> 39:58.003
Well, the prognosis
is pretty fucking shitty,

39:58.090 --> 39:59.330
so, uh...

40:02.735 --> 40:06.357
Actually, he needs to get angry
in order to fight this,

40:06.444 --> 40:07.977
so how do I do that?

40:08.064 --> 40:09.672
How do I
shake him out of this?

40:09.791 --> 40:11.329
Out of what, exactly?

40:11.435 --> 40:12.782
This denial.

40:13.296 --> 40:14.423
Seriously.

40:14.744 --> 40:16.188
I mean, it's, like...

40:16.782 --> 40:18.243
pathological.

40:18.569 --> 40:20.334
Don't you think? I mean,
I've always thought maybe

40:20.421 --> 40:22.725
he's on the spectrum,
so maybe that has something...

40:22.812 --> 40:25.079
I'm not here
to diagnose Vik.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.569
I'd like to redirect us
to talking about you, Helen.

40:28.656 --> 40:31.902
You and Vik both received
scary news this morning.

40:32.806 --> 40:34.467
I'd like to talk
about what you're feeling

40:34.554 --> 40:36.185
right now in this moment.

40:36.272 --> 40:38.235
I'm feeling like Vik
isn't listening to me.

40:38.322 --> 40:41.876
I'm feeling... like I want him
to get treatment.

40:42.137 --> 40:43.509
Okay.

40:45.033 --> 40:46.696
Let's try focusing inward.

40:46.856 --> 40:48.391
Can you close your eyes?

40:55.845 --> 40:59.626
Let's take a deep breath,
establish a baseline.

41:01.689 --> 41:03.443
- Helen.
- I really don't want

41:03.530 --> 41:04.864
to close my eyes right now.

41:04.961 --> 41:06.821
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:07.697 --> 41:09.076
But I want us
to try to continue.

41:09.163 --> 41:10.506
Can you find
something in the room

41:10.593 --> 41:12.407
to focus on instead?

41:16.600 --> 41:18.305
You went to Stanford?

41:18.892 --> 41:20.047
I did.

41:20.134 --> 41:21.954
And now can we focus
on your breath?

41:22.041 --> 41:24.039
Do you know anyone there
in oncology?

41:24.126 --> 41:25.288
Helen.

41:25.410 --> 41:26.772
I mean, maybe you
could make a call

41:26.859 --> 41:28.389
and just find out
if anything's happening there

41:28.476 --> 41:29.547
that might help Vik.
Maybe

41:29.634 --> 41:31.196
you could get him
into a trial or...

41:31.283 --> 41:33.943
Helen, I'm delighted to help
in whatever way I can.

41:34.030 --> 41:35.319
I will make a call if that's

41:35.406 --> 41:37.016
the decision you
and Vik come to,

41:37.103 --> 41:38.735
but right now
in this moment,

41:39.227 --> 41:40.434
can we return to our work?

41:40.521 --> 41:41.735
Can we focus on your breath?

41:41.822 --> 41:44.102
No, I can't do that.

41:46.144 --> 41:47.580
Right now.

41:49.388 --> 41:52.305
Okay. Okay.

41:52.974 --> 41:54.376
You want to talk about Vik.

41:54.463 --> 41:56.915
Let's do that.
So I have a question for you.

41:57.272 --> 41:59.024
You're very
concerned for him.

41:59.337 --> 42:00.422
Of course.

42:00.541 --> 42:01.844
Given that,

42:02.841 --> 42:04.508
why do you think
it feels so hard

42:04.595 --> 42:05.772
to give him
what he's asking for?

42:05.859 --> 42:08.055
Because I don't want to have
another fucking baby.

42:09.564 --> 42:11.508
I'm talking about

42:12.869 --> 42:15.071
giving him the space

42:16.228 --> 42:18.782
to make his own choices
about his care.

42:21.009 --> 42:25.165
If he wants advice, guidance,
he has doctors for that.

42:25.348 --> 42:27.144
What he needs you for,
the one thing

42:27.231 --> 42:29.204
you can give him that
no one else in the world can,

42:29.291 --> 42:30.477
is your love.

42:30.564 --> 42:31.936
You love him.

42:36.576 --> 42:38.034
How do you know?

42:38.647 --> 42:40.151
How do I know what?

42:42.847 --> 42:44.300
That I love him.

42:51.689 --> 42:53.323
Say more about that question.

42:53.410 --> 42:55.409
Never mind.
I don't know why I said that.

42:55.496 --> 42:56.643
Of course I love him.

42:56.851 --> 42:59.115
I'm just wondering if perhaps

42:59.419 --> 43:01.912
loving Vik feels frightening
to you right now.

43:02.155 --> 43:03.314
Why?

43:03.452 --> 43:05.615
Is it possible that all this...

43:07.046 --> 43:09.777
The obsession
with Vik's treatment,

43:09.864 --> 43:11.726
what you see
as his denial...

43:11.813 --> 43:15.053
is actually a projection
of your own terror?

43:15.710 --> 43:19.467
The prospect of losing this man
with whom you've built a life?

43:25.397 --> 43:27.967
Who couldn't you
live without, Ezra?

43:33.439 --> 43:34.749
My sons.

43:34.842 --> 43:36.498
Children don't count.

43:37.124 --> 43:38.889
Hmm. Okay, then.

43:39.837 --> 43:41.171
My wife.

43:41.671 --> 43:42.990
My brother.

43:43.241 --> 43:44.756
What about you?

43:49.342 --> 43:51.029
My children, of course.

43:53.355 --> 43:54.959
Anyone else?

44:02.501 --> 44:04.084
You know what, I have to go.

44:04.902 --> 44:06.526
I have to get Vik
into treatment,

44:06.613 --> 44:07.935
and we are going
back to New York,

44:08.022 --> 44:10.144
and I am gonna get him there.
I don't know how, but I will,

44:10.231 --> 44:12.375
because you know
what people in New York do

44:12.462 --> 44:14.154
who are dying, Ezra?
They don't sit around

44:14.241 --> 44:16.459
and take deep breaths.
They fucking fight.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.824
I know I have
to wrap this up,

45:45.911 --> 45:48.199
so in closing,
I'd just like to say...

45:48.520 --> 45:51.181
I'm thrilled that my new role

45:51.268 --> 45:53.128
as your chief
of pediatric surgery

45:53.215 --> 45:56.433
has brought me home,
back to L.A.

45:58.111 --> 46:00.471
This award, and the...

46:00.784 --> 46:02.578
recognition
of the work I've done,

46:02.665 --> 46:04.408
it means so much to me.

46:04.803 --> 46:08.096
But what means even more
is the work to come.

46:08.495 --> 46:10.774
The work that we'll
do together.

46:13.032 --> 46:16.950
I hope tonight is the start
of a long journey.

46:17.253 --> 46:18.480
Thank you.

46:41.572 --> 46:43.993
It seems your colleagues
enjoyed the speech.

46:44.080 --> 46:45.539
Thanks, Dad.

46:45.894 --> 46:47.697
Well done, son.
Well done.

46:47.784 --> 46:49.850
Let's take a photograph
with your father.

46:49.937 --> 46:51.297
- Okay.
- Yeah.

46:53.752 --> 46:54.888
There we go.

46:54.975 --> 46:56.512
Very nice.

46:56.819 --> 46:58.227
And one more.

46:58.689 --> 46:59.962
Lovely.

47:00.323 --> 47:03.277
Okay, why don't we
take one with the award?

47:03.364 --> 47:05.766
- Where is it?
- Helen, can you...

47:08.043 --> 47:09.146
Thanks.

47:09.233 --> 47:10.352
Congratulations.

47:10.439 --> 47:12.751
Oh, thanks, guys.
Thank you.

47:13.502 --> 47:16.399
Um, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna run to the ladies'...

47:16.486 --> 47:17.759
Beautiful.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.466
..room.

47:23.335 --> 47:25.893
No, I didn't.
I took the 101 to the 405.

47:25.980 --> 47:27.305
And you got off on Sunset?

47:27.392 --> 47:29.143
- No, Wilshire.
- Wilshire. Brilliant.

47:29.230 --> 47:31.149
I came over Laurel Canyon,
which was a disaster,

47:31.236 --> 47:33.928
and then I went down to Beverly,
which was a nightmare.

47:34.015 --> 47:35.695
Oh, no,
you can't take Beverly.

47:35.782 --> 47:37.688
All the schools get out
at the same time.

47:37.775 --> 47:39.290
Oh, now you tell me.

47:39.457 --> 47:41.998
By the way,
your tits look great.

47:42.085 --> 47:44.438
Thanks. They're new.

47:46.814 --> 47:49.516
You have to give me
the name of your surgeon.

47:49.603 --> 47:52.204
Oh, I will,
but he's booked for two years.

47:52.291 --> 47:54.458
He must be so good.

47:54.545 --> 47:56.547
He really is the best.

47:56.741 --> 47:57.876
Hi.

48:02.001 --> 48:04.334
That was a great
speech, wasn't it?

48:04.421 --> 48:06.899
Mm-hmm.
Vik did very well.

48:08.963 --> 48:11.868
He's worked so hard
his whole life.

48:12.094 --> 48:13.966
From when he was
a little boy,

48:14.053 --> 48:17.133
he just pushed himself
and pushed himself.

48:17.553 --> 48:21.555
Abdul and I were so worried
that he would never slow down,

48:21.647 --> 48:23.680
never enjoy his success.

48:23.887 --> 48:26.110
But now,
finally, he can.

48:26.601 --> 48:28.645
And I am so happy for him.

48:35.105 --> 48:36.954
Priya, I need your help.

48:43.488 --> 48:45.448
Vik is very sick.

48:46.705 --> 48:47.977
And he won't
listen to me.

48:48.064 --> 48:49.415
He's refusing treatment.

48:49.502 --> 48:51.969
But he has to do something.
If he waits...

48:54.917 --> 48:57.594
And I know how much
you and Abdul mean to him

48:57.892 --> 48:59.545
and how much he wants
to make you proud,

48:59.632 --> 49:01.649
so I just... I just
thought that maybe if it...

49:01.736 --> 49:03.032
if it came from you...

49:18.938 --> 49:20.649
Thank you for telling me.

49:49.147 --> 49:51.899
- Hi.
- My mom's not feeling well.

49:52.981 --> 49:54.030
Oh.

49:54.117 --> 49:56.077
She's got
a bad headache.

49:56.355 --> 49:57.532
So...

49:57.619 --> 49:58.720
we're leaving early.

49:58.807 --> 50:00.122
No. Oh, don't leave.

50:00.209 --> 50:02.024
I-I have Advil, I think.

50:02.111 --> 50:05.144
No, a little rest
is what I need.

50:07.689 --> 50:09.144
I'm gonna walk them out.

50:09.570 --> 50:11.134
I'm gonna come with you.

50:11.221 --> 50:12.298
Oh, sorry.

50:13.387 --> 50:15.363
You're sure you know
how to get home from here?

50:15.458 --> 50:16.847
I can write down
directions.

50:16.934 --> 50:19.517
If we get lost again,
we'll stop at a petrol station.

50:19.604 --> 50:21.548
Dad, it'll take two seconds.
Just let...

50:21.635 --> 50:23.341
The car is here, Priya.

50:23.814 --> 50:25.199
We'll see you soon, Vikram.

50:25.286 --> 50:27.246
Okay. Good night, Mom.

50:35.748 --> 50:37.597
Priya. Priya.

50:37.814 --> 50:39.636
Did you not hear
what I said?

50:40.113 --> 50:42.050
Vik has cancer.

50:42.137 --> 50:45.839
He has late-stage cancer,
and he needs to get treatment.

50:45.926 --> 50:47.357
Please, I don't know...

50:54.863 --> 50:56.785
I don't know
what else to do.

50:58.137 --> 50:59.825
Please.

51:04.564 --> 51:07.410
You're going to figure
this out, Vikram.

51:07.536 --> 51:09.371
You always do.

51:10.686 --> 51:12.324
Thanks, Ma.

51:27.980 --> 51:29.651
Hand me the water.

51:42.459 --> 51:45.232
Can we please talk
about this like adults?

51:59.481 --> 52:01.878
I asked you
to do one thing.

52:03.004 --> 52:05.208
One thing.

52:06.105 --> 52:09.324
I asked you not
to tell my parents.

52:09.571 --> 52:11.141
- And what did you do?
- I had to.

52:11.228 --> 52:12.988
She's your mother.

52:13.168 --> 52:16.880
Ho-Ho-Honestly, I don't...
I don't understand your family.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.579
It's like you're all in denial.

52:18.666 --> 52:20.714
Is it just
a way of life for you?

52:21.928 --> 52:23.574
Oh, my God.

52:25.706 --> 52:28.666
You really don't understand
anything, do you?

52:30.856 --> 52:33.480
You might as well have
grown up in a fucking castle.

52:33.567 --> 52:37.105
You are such a privileged,
entitled little...

52:46.136 --> 52:48.542
You want to criticize
my parents?

52:51.048 --> 52:54.604
What the fuck have you ever
had to sacrifice for your kids?

52:57.527 --> 52:59.377
My dad was a doctor.

53:01.076 --> 53:02.542
A cardiologist.

53:03.011 --> 53:07.101
Like, a really respected
young doctor back in Beirut.

53:07.188 --> 53:09.776
And now he's
a fucking dry cleaner

53:10.094 --> 53:12.338
because he wanted
to raise me here.

53:14.746 --> 53:16.737
They never
took vacations

53:16.824 --> 53:18.979
or-or went home
for weddings

53:19.066 --> 53:22.151
or births or funerals,

53:23.480 --> 53:26.745
because every last scrap
of money was for Vikram.

53:28.102 --> 53:30.187
For Vikram's education.

53:31.933 --> 53:35.799
So they could send me
to college and medical school.

53:37.426 --> 53:40.843
They denied
themselves everything

53:41.045 --> 53:43.446
to make me into something
they could be proud of.

53:43.533 --> 53:47.667
So yeah, yeah, denial
is a way of life for them,

53:47.754 --> 53:50.851
and all I wanted,
all I asked of you,

53:50.938 --> 53:52.821
was to spare them
the pain of knowing

53:52.908 --> 53:54.589
that all that
was for nothing.

53:54.739 --> 53:59.003
I mean, couldn't they get
one night, just one night,

53:59.739 --> 54:03.113
to enjoy what all of
their sacrifice had achieved?

54:03.296 --> 54:06.386
Don't say it was
all for nothing.

54:06.473 --> 54:07.564
We don't know that.

54:07.651 --> 54:09.847
There are treatments.
There are trials.

54:09.934 --> 54:12.829
You're not a fucking
doctor, Helen. I am.

54:12.916 --> 54:14.996
- I know.
- No, you don't.

54:16.309 --> 54:19.066
I have pancreatic cancer.

54:20.439 --> 54:23.253
And those trials
aren't promising.

54:23.494 --> 54:24.878
They're desperate.

54:25.786 --> 54:28.972
Because there is
no real treatment for this.

54:29.952 --> 54:31.777
There is no cure.

54:32.652 --> 54:34.043
No hope.

54:36.411 --> 54:38.582
I am going to die.

54:57.369 --> 54:59.625
I've spent
my entire career

54:59.712 --> 55:02.430
giving false hope
to my patients,

55:04.149 --> 55:06.805
and I am not gonna
fucking do it for you.

55:11.856 --> 55:13.522
I'm sorry.

55:17.462 --> 55:18.963
Vik, I'm really sorry.

55:19.050 --> 55:21.344
I, uh... I fucked up.

55:23.689 --> 55:24.865
What do you want me to do?

55:24.952 --> 55:26.243
I told you.

55:30.801 --> 55:32.493
I want to have a baby.

55:35.978 --> 55:38.194
If you really want
to do something for me,

55:38.281 --> 55:39.469
you can do that.

56:36.376 --> 56:38.302
We're so lucky
to be here.

56:38.389 --> 56:41.196
I heard this guy's
success rate is insane.

56:47.063 --> 56:48.610
Can I ask you a question?

56:48.772 --> 56:50.009
Sure.

56:50.314 --> 56:52.813
Who was president
the year you were born?

56:53.822 --> 56:54.980
Bush?
