Previously on AMC's
Breaking Bad...

00:02.893 --> 00:03.999
Are you moving back in?

00:04.160 --> 00:05.174
Yes.

00:05.337 --> 00:08.272
Do you really think
that's... that's a good idea?

00:08.386 --> 00:10.287
A list of names.
They trace back to Madrigal

00:10.411 --> 00:11.733
and they're gonna get
picked up by the police.

00:11.847 --> 00:14.110
Outstanding work, Hank.
If only we had listened.

00:14.252 --> 00:15.781
It's not right to put
this on you.

00:15.901 --> 00:18.060
Shut up! Shut up!

00:18.680 --> 00:19.889
Breakdown?
What does that mean?

00:19.991 --> 00:21.940
It means I don't know
what else to call it.

00:22.263 --> 00:23.486
You do know, right?

00:23.578 --> 00:25.130
She was having an affair.

00:25.616 --> 00:27.656
Can you still get your
hands on methylamine?

00:27.793 --> 00:29.652
Maybe.
Why?

00:31.111 --> 00:32.912
I gotta say,
when you first brought her in,

00:32.946 --> 00:34.446
I had my doubts.

00:34.447 --> 00:37.949
But your little darling's
got nine lives.

00:41.153 --> 00:45.023
Rear-wheel assembly took the
brunt of the impact, so, uh...

00:45.057 --> 00:46.424
Yeah.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.227
CV shaft, boots,
joints, axle--

00:49.261 --> 00:51.594
Replaced all of it.
No way around it.

00:51.629 --> 00:54.497
I went after market
on most of the parts here.

00:54.532 --> 00:57.134
You want me to swap in
factory parts, that's fine.

00:57.168 --> 00:59.869
But using after-market's the only
way we'll keep it under blue book

00:59.904 --> 01:03.140
and on the insurance company's
dime, okay?

01:03.174 --> 01:05.141
Nothing beats free.

01:05.176 --> 01:07.743
Uh, swapped out
your air filter,

01:07.777 --> 01:10.246
topped off your fluids.

01:10.280 --> 01:12.699
Didn't have to replace
the windshield this time.

01:12.832 --> 01:14.159
I know, right?

01:14.484 --> 01:16.285
Oh, and I noticed you had

01:16.320 --> 01:18.487
some sort of gunky buildup

01:18.521 --> 01:20.489
in the front end here.

01:20.523 --> 01:23.291
First, I had no idea
what I was looking at.

01:23.326 --> 01:25.093
Then I remembered
that you had me replace

01:25.127 --> 01:27.177
that front fender
a few months back

01:27.285 --> 01:29.027
when you ran over that deer.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.466
We went at it
with the steam hose,

01:31.500 --> 01:33.301
cleaned it up for you.

01:33.336 --> 01:36.637
Hardest part was the paint.

01:36.672 --> 01:39.506
Fern green.
Interesting tint.

01:39.540 --> 01:41.241
Anything else?

01:41.276 --> 01:44.378
That's it.
Zero balance, like I said.

01:44.412 --> 01:47.448
Sign here, you're good to go.

01:49.050 --> 01:50.517
People like to joke,

01:50.551 --> 01:56.089
but I really, really like this car.
She's * hell.

01:56.123 --> 01:59.492
I'm betting you get another
200,000 miles out of her.

02:24.750 --> 02:26.750
What would you give me for it?

02:26.784 --> 02:28.486
What's the blue book, you mean?

02:28.520 --> 02:32.523
No. I mean, what will
you pay me for this car?

02:32.557 --> 02:35.192
Well, I'm not
really looking for--

02:35.227 --> 02:37.561
$100?

02:37.595 --> 02:39.163
Fifty?

02:39.197 --> 02:42.065
Insurance company just shelled
out 1,900 for the parts alone.

02:42.099 --> 02:44.067
Then it's a bargain.

02:44.101 --> 02:47.470
You give me 50 bucks,
and she's all yours.

02:47.505 --> 02:49.372
You sure about this?

02:49.407 --> 02:50.740
Sure as shooting.

02:50.774 --> 02:53.910
I'll check the register.

02:53.944 --> 02:55.545

barge into my office,
screaming and yelling at me,

07:51.022 --> 07:54.291

all over the warehouse, okay?

07:54.325 --> 07:55.792

07:55.826 --> 07:58.194
Besides, Ron was my guy.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.129

I don't have a guy anymore.

08:00.256 --> 08:02.588
Ron fixed security and pulled
the barrels and drove the truck.

08:45.705 --> 08:48.508

- Horsepower isn't everything.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.009
Don't you know that?

08:50.044 --> 08:54.347
You have to factor in drag
and torque and suspension

08:54.381 --> 08:56.349
and weight of the car.

08:56.383 --> 08:58.784
And listen, one more factor that
you're not thinking about--

08:58.818 --> 09:00.452
The experience of the driver.

09:00.486 --> 09:02.254
- And I totally got you there.
- Please. Please.

09:02.288 --> 09:04.722

I don't think so.

09:11.063 --> 09:12.463
Whoa.

- And, yes, I did.
- Seriously?

09:13.831 --> 09:15.799
Yes, seriously.
And if you show me

09:15.833 --> 09:18.235
just a modicum of respect,
maybe I'll teach you.

- No.

- Yes. Yes. No--

- You're saying yes.

09:24.842 --> 09:26.209
No! No, no.
That was kidding.

09:26.243 --> 09:28.378

- Yes. Yes.

09:28.412 --> 09:29.979
- We are now.
- That doesn't count!

09:31.248 --> 09:33.983
[Walt]
I know you don't approve.

09:36.153 --> 09:41.691
But mine... we'll call it a
birthday present to myself.

09:41.725 --> 09:43.725
And Junior's...

09:44.961 --> 09:46.928
People will just chalk that up

09:46.963 --> 09:49.498
as me being a softy.

09:51.969 --> 09:53.969
And besides...

09:53.970 --> 09:56.738
I didn't actually buy
either one.

09:56.772 --> 10:00.641
They're both leases.
So it all fits our story.

10:00.675 --> 10:02.643
Okay?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.313
Oh.

10:15.756 --> 10:18.525
We can afford it now.
Hmm?

10:20.929 --> 10:22.929
You're back at it.

10:22.930 --> 10:25.165
Well, yeah.

10:25.199 --> 10:29.269

that 600,000 we lost.

about boarding school?

10:43.483 --> 10:45.451
Boarding school?

10:45.485 --> 10:48.753
For who--
For Junior?

10:48.787 --> 10:51.356
There's this place
in northern Arizona,

10:51.390 --> 10:53.358
and it's supposed to be

10:53.392 --> 10:55.726
one of the top ten
in the country.

10:57.196 --> 10:59.297
He's a year away from college.

10:59.331 --> 11:02.799
Why on earth would we do that?

11:02.833 --> 11:05.902
I don't know.
I just...

11:05.936 --> 11:08.205
Just thinking about the kids.

11:08.239 --> 11:11.074
Mmm. Holly, too?

11:11.108 --> 11:13.710
Where are we sending
our eight-month-old?

11:13.744 --> 11:17.414
Peace corps?

11:17.448 --> 11:19.448
No. I just...

11:22.186 --> 11:24.153
A new environment

11:24.188 --> 11:26.422
might be good for them.

11:26.456 --> 11:28.457
What does that mean?

11:30.458 --> 11:33.076
What's wrong with
their environment?

11:35.665 --> 11:37.165
Skyler...

11:39.034 --> 11:42.204
What's wrong
with their environment?

11:45.007 --> 11:46.808
Nothing.

11:53.915 --> 11:55.249
Hey.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.000
Listen, I know these
last few weeks

12:00.121 --> 12:02.089
have been rough.

12:02.123 --> 12:03.757
The threat to Hank

12:03.791 --> 12:06.559
and this whole thing
with Beneke.

12:07.861 --> 12:10.563
But there's absolutely nothing

12:10.598 --> 12:13.266
for you to be afraid of
anymore, okay?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.268
I mean, clear sailing
from here on out.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.169
I promise.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.507
You know, I want us to try

12:21.542 --> 12:24.610

to things again.

12:25.678 --> 12:28.580

12:30.149 --> 12:31.617

12:31.651 --> 12:33.619
I don't know
what you have planned,

12:33.653 --> 12:37.556
and with everything
that's been going on lately,

12:37.590 --> 12:39.990
I'd understand if you haven't
even given it a thought.

12:39.991 --> 12:43.000
But I think

12:43.194 --> 12:46.163
a little celebration
might be good.

12:46.197 --> 12:48.399
For all of us.

12:48.433 --> 12:52.770
You know, a birthday party.

12:52.804 --> 12:56.172

12:57.875 --> 12:59.976
Yeah?

13:00.010 --> 13:01.578
Okay.

13:01.612 --> 13:04.748
And maybe, if I may be so bold,

13:04.782 --> 13:08.241
chocolate cake
with chocolate icing?

13:13.456 --> 13:15.824

- Dad's bacon.

13:38.714 --> 13:40.582
That's okay.
I can do it.

13:40.616 --> 13:42.617
No. Mom has to.

13:54.930 --> 13:56.330

14:02.637 --> 14:05.939
What is she doing?
Hmm?

14:07.641 --> 14:11.778
That's a pretty small "1."

14:11.812 --> 14:13.780
Kind of is.

14:13.814 --> 14:16.783
Just a little.
[Chuckling]

14:18.386 --> 14:20.687
Ah, now you're talking.

14:20.721 --> 14:23.155
- No. No.
- Good move.

14:23.190 --> 14:24.923
- No.
- No, no, no. It's good.

14:24.958 --> 14:26.925
Very good.
Family teamwork.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.228

Very important.

- Thank you, buddy.

hinky, though, you know?

over here in Germany,

14:49.582 --> 14:52.283
and 5,000 miles away,
you got this guy.

14:52.318 --> 14:54.284
There's gotta be someone
in the middle, you know?

14:54.319 --> 14:56.420
Someone we're missing.

14:58.256 --> 15:02.325
What about that, uh,
Lydia what's-her-name?

15:02.359 --> 15:04.160
You know, lady banjo eyes
at the warehouse?

15:04.194 --> 15:06.529
In this world?
No way.

15:06.563 --> 15:08.164
Too uptight.
Too together.

15:08.198 --> 15:10.566
Maybe.

15:10.601 --> 15:12.869

mismatched shoes.

How together can she be?

15:15.205 --> 15:16.873
[Exhales forcefully]

15:19.409 --> 15:21.677
Gentlemen,
how goes it with Fring?

15:21.711 --> 15:25.214
You know, just, uh,
working through the grief.

15:25.249 --> 15:28.284
How soon before
you submit a final?

15:28.318 --> 15:31.254
Well, we've been
kicking around some ideas.

15:31.288 --> 15:33.288
Had you asked me that
a couple of weeks ago,

15:33.322 --> 15:36.491
- I'd have said this was
just a mop-up job, but... - But?

15:36.526 --> 15:39.161
Well, no one on Fring's crew
is talking to us.

15:39.195 --> 15:41.396
I mean, not a peep,
no matter how hard we squeeze.

15:41.430 --> 15:43.965
Which makes it likely there's somebody
out there keeping them in line.

15:43.999 --> 15:47.569
Our money is on this guy--
Michael Ehrmantraut.

15:47.603 --> 15:50.671
He's Fring's head
of "corporate" security.

15:50.705 --> 15:53.674
- He's a definite hard case.
- Now, we're gonna stay on him.

15:53.708 --> 15:56.177
We're putting together a
surveillance team as we speak.

15:56.211 --> 15:58.312
Okay?
The other thing is--

15:58.346 --> 16:03.284
This may be unrelated, but the blue meth
is... is making a bit of a * back.

16:03.318 --> 16:06.452
- Tell him, Gomie. - Yeah. Some small
amounts on the street-side pulls.

16:06.487 --> 16:08.521
Lab's telling us
it's the same stuff.

16:08.556 --> 16:10.756
I mean, it could be
old inventory leaking out,

16:10.791 --> 16:14.294
or it could be
somebody's rebooting,

16:14.328 --> 16:18.231
using Fring's former cooks
to set up a new operation.

16:18.265 --> 16:19.932
I thought we had
Fring's cooks--

16:19.966 --> 16:21.966
the unsubs in the lab fire.

16:22.001 --> 16:24.969
Thought maybe one of them
was your Heisenberg.

16:25.004 --> 16:28.340
Yeah. Maybe.
I don't know.

16:28.374 --> 16:31.476
Like I said,
there's still a lot of questions.

16:32.945 --> 16:35.447
Agent Gomez,
could you give us a moment?

16:39.918 --> 16:42.119
Hank, I gotta say,

16:42.120 --> 16:45.489
your work here
has been stellar.

16:45.524 --> 16:47.491
Really first rate.

16:47.526 --> 16:49.327
Thank you, sir.

16:49.361 --> 16:52.630
So much so that I'm wondering
if it's time you made a change.

16:52.664 --> 16:55.965
You know, I have to
get back to El Paso.

16:55.999 --> 16:58.568
This office needs an ASAC,

16:58.603 --> 17:01.003
and I'm thinking we should be
promoting from within.

17:01.038 --> 17:03.172
If you were to put in
an application,

17:03.207 --> 17:06.609
and I recommend that you do,
you will get the job.

17:06.644 --> 17:08.845
I have no doubt this DO
would be well served

17:08.878 --> 17:11.413
with you at the helm.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.282
Wow. That's, uh...

17:15.385 --> 17:17.353
I'm not sure what to say.

17:17.387 --> 17:19.355
It's a big step up.

17:19.388 --> 17:21.123
It's not without its headaches.

17:21.156 --> 17:22.924
Politics may take
some getting used to.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.359
Plus, you'd be overseeing
every case in the office,

17:25.394 --> 17:27.262
so you'd need to reassign
all your day-to-days,

17:27.296 --> 17:28.796
Fring included.

17:28.830 --> 17:31.733
Much as I hate losing
a good field man,

17:31.767 --> 17:34.302
that's the job,
and you need to be okay with it.

17:35.671 --> 17:37.838
What do you say, Hank?

17:39.207 --> 17:41.142
You want it?

17:42.677 --> 17:44.311
Well,

17:44.345 --> 17:46.713
considering my wife would
murder me if I said "no"...

17:46.748 --> 17:49.149
[Chuckles]

17:49.183 --> 17:51.618
Yeah. I want it.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.853
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:02.829 --> 18:04.930
Can you, uh,

18:04.964 --> 18:07.333
finish up for me?

18:07.367 --> 18:09.802
It's-- it's my birthday.

18:09.836 --> 18:12.838
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

18:12.872 --> 18:15.340
I probably have
a birthday party

18:15.374 --> 18:17.842
waiting for me, you know, so...

18:17.876 --> 18:21.245
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Yeah, no problem.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.548
Hey, uh, happy birthday.

18:24.817 --> 18:26.484
Thanks.

18:44.970 --> 18:47.470
<i>[Men crying out,</i>

Oh, hey.

19:12.729 --> 19:15.364
<i>[Man chattering]</i>

19:15.398 --> 19:19.267
So, what's the plan?

19:19.301 --> 19:22.470
Um, Hank and Marie
are on their way,

19:22.504 --> 19:25.506
roast chicken and potatoes
for dinner,

19:25.540 --> 19:27.308
rocky road for desert,

19:27.343 --> 19:33.248
and, uh, chocolate cake,
as requested.

19:33.282 --> 19:36.549
[Microwave on]

19:45.994 --> 19:48.228
What's up?

19:48.263 --> 19:50.229
Me?

19:50.264 --> 19:52.731
Nothing.

19:52.766 --> 19:57.069
Thought you'd be more jazzed
about the new job.

19:57.104 --> 19:59.238
No! What--
No! I am!

19:59.273 --> 20:01.507
- Baby, I'm so proud of you.
- Yeah, yeah, okay, okay...

20:01.541 --> 20:04.343
- Sorry, sorry.
- I believe you. Just don't kill us here.

20:05.812 --> 20:07.779
[Sighs]

20:07.813 --> 20:11.116
Marie, you've been moping
around the last few days.

20:12.751 --> 20:14.319
Marie?

20:16.588 --> 20:19.090
What's up?

20:19.125 --> 20:21.626
- Marie, come on.
- I'm sorry. I...

20:22.627 --> 20:24.628
I made a promise to someone.

20:26.631 --> 20:28.265
To who?

20:30.501 --> 20:32.903
- Who?
- Your brother-in-law.

20:35.407 --> 20:37.408
Are you gonna give me
a hint at least?

20:37.442 --> 20:40.276
It involves infidelity.
That's all I'm gonna say.

20:43.080 --> 20:46.549
Oh, shit.
I knew it.

20:48.819 --> 20:51.087
Knew what? What did you--
What did you know?

20:51.121 --> 20:54.689
Well, I mean, I didn't know it,
but I've been saying it forever.

20:54.723 --> 20:56.925
Walt's second cell phone,
you know?

20:56.960 --> 20:59.361
Sorry, babe, but I was way
ahead of you on this one.

21:01.097 --> 21:03.898
Way ahead of me.
Oh.

21:05.768 --> 21:08.270
Well, it wasn't Walt.

21:11.706 --> 21:13.374
Skyler?

21:17.179 --> 21:19.113
No way.

21:24.386 --> 21:25.353
Hey.

21:25.387 --> 21:28.188
- Hey! There she is!
- Hey! Hi!

21:28.222 --> 21:30.123
- Hey!
- Hey!

21:30.157 --> 21:32.492
- Hey, buddy. Yeah.
- Welcome. Welcome.

21:32.493 --> 21:34.493
Happy birthday!

21:36.063 --> 21:38.331
I'm in the center lane
going about 60,

21:38.366 --> 21:41.301
and I had no choice but just
tear butt out of there.

21:41.335 --> 21:43.668
Just bwaaa!
So sweet.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.737
Yeah, you know, highway patrol's
gonna be sweet on it too.

21:45.771 --> 21:47.672
Gonna get their ticket quota
in a month.

21:47.707 --> 21:49.541
You'll help me out,
right, Uncle Hank,

21:49.575 --> 21:51.543
now that you run the DEA?

21:51.577 --> 21:54.779
Oh, yeah. For my spoiled brat
car wash millionaire nephew?

21:54.814 --> 21:57.516
Sure. I'll make sure you get
a cell with a view.

21:57.550 --> 21:58.616
[Laughter]

21:58.650 --> 22:00.251
All right.

22:00.285 --> 22:03.087
- Well, I'm outta here.
- Okay.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.156
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you, buddy.

22:05.190 --> 22:09.427
- Congratulations again, Uncle Hank.
- Thanks.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.396
- I'll see y'all later.
[Walt] - All right.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.031
- All right. Have fun.
- Bye, drive safe.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.125
- Drive safely, okay?
- I do.

22:15.258 --> 22:17.467
- Slow down.
- Never.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.877
A hell of a couple cars
there, Walt.

22:27.912 --> 22:30.046
Honey, for my next birthday,

22:30.080 --> 22:31.847
I'm gonna take
a page here from Walt

22:31.881 --> 22:34.150
and buy myself a jet plane.

22:34.184 --> 22:36.852
[Walt] Well, maybe
I over did it a little.

22:36.886 --> 22:38.787
But with these
new lease rates--

22:38.821 --> 22:41.424
I mean,
they're mighty attractive.

22:50.299 --> 22:52.300
Great dinner, Skyler.

22:52.334 --> 22:55.770
Those were some bad-ass
whipped potatoes, I tell you.

22:55.804 --> 22:58.239
You have to tell me
how you get all the lumps out.

22:58.274 --> 22:59.574
How do you do that?

22:59.608 --> 23:04.062
- A potato ricer.
- A ricer?

23:04.145 --> 23:06.746
You don't hand mash?

23:07.949 --> 23:09.683
No.

23:18.525 --> 23:20.993
- Well, uh...
- Boy, it has...

23:21.027 --> 23:24.029
It has been quite a year, huh?
[Chuckles]

23:24.064 --> 23:26.031
Do you know that, uh,

23:26.066 --> 23:29.368
it's almost exactly a year ago

23:29.403 --> 23:31.404
that I got my diagnosis?

23:31.438 --> 23:33.339
- Jesus. Yeah, right?
- Yeah.

23:33.373 --> 23:36.308
- Seems like longer, doesn't it?
- Yeah. No. It's, uh...

23:38.111 --> 23:39.811
One year ago tomorrow.

23:39.845 --> 23:42.547
Day after my 50th.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.947
Honestly, I never thought
I'd make it this far.

23:47.553 --> 23:51.322
The cancer and surgery

23:51.356 --> 23:53.957
and Hank being shot--

23:53.992 --> 23:55.759
It's just...

23:55.793 --> 23:58.229
So many dark days.

23:58.263 --> 24:00.364
Well...
[Chuckles]

24:00.398 --> 24:03.501
There's Marie's talking pillow.

24:03.535 --> 24:06.369
Remember that?
[Chuckling]

24:06.403 --> 24:08.070
It was...
[Mutters]

24:08.105 --> 24:11.274
Boy, I did not want
to get any treatment.

24:14.211 --> 24:17.947
I think I was too scared

24:17.981 --> 24:19.815
or too angry or...

24:19.850 --> 24:23.152
I don't know.
I just wanted to quit.

24:24.354 --> 24:28.323
But you guys--
You got me through it somehow.

24:29.325 --> 24:31.326
Kept me going.

24:32.462 --> 24:36.331
And that happened again
and again and again.

24:36.366 --> 24:38.966
I mean, there were times

24:39.000 --> 24:42.470
when I was sure I was done for.

24:42.504 --> 24:44.872
But then someone

24:44.906 --> 24:47.074
or something

24:47.108 --> 24:51.512
would come through for me.

24:51.547 --> 24:54.414
God. And Skyler--
I can't--

24:54.448 --> 24:57.184
Honey, remember that
first week of chemotherapy?

24:57.218 --> 24:59.619
That night
on the bathroom floor?

24:59.654 --> 25:01.953
What you said to me?

25:03.954 --> 25:05.926
I was so sick.

25:05.992 --> 25:09.361
It was rough going at first.

25:09.396 --> 25:11.463
But Skyler--

25:11.498 --> 25:13.899
She was right there, of course,

25:13.933 --> 25:16.868
putting wet washcloths
on my forehead.

25:16.903 --> 25:18.969
And she's singing to me.

25:19.004 --> 25:22.273
And this would go on and on,

25:22.308 --> 25:24.975
day after day.

25:25.010 --> 25:28.646
And I remember I was lying
on the floor of the bathroom,

25:28.681 --> 25:33.350
because the tile felt
nice and cool, you know?

25:33.384 --> 25:36.353
And my head
was in Skyler's lap,

25:36.387 --> 25:39.590
and I was just asking her

25:39.624 --> 25:42.292
if this could all be over.

25:43.695 --> 25:47.997
It was too hard. It was...
I just wanted it to stop.

25:48.032 --> 25:50.733
Skyler, isn't that freezing?

25:53.670 --> 25:55.605
[Hank]
Whoa. Hey-o. Pool party.

25:56.973 --> 25:58.874
What are you doing, Skyler?
[Chuckles]

25:58.908 --> 26:01.510
What is she doing?
Walt?

26:01.545 --> 26:04.547
Hey, uh, Sky,
maybe it's time to get out now.

26:04.581 --> 26:05.913
What do you think?

26:05.948 --> 26:08.049
Skyler, Hank asked you
a question.

26:08.083 --> 26:11.753
You need to get out n--
Skyler!

26:11.787 --> 26:14.088
She's gonna come up, right?

26:14.089 --> 26:15.539
She has to.

26:23.498 --> 26:26.099
[Muffled] Skyler, you need to get out.
[Water splashes]

26:37.900 --> 26:40.100
Oh, my God.

26:40.135 --> 26:42.769
Wha-- Okay.

26:42.803 --> 26:45.705
Okay. It's gotta be...

26:49.244 --> 26:51.378
Nope.
[Beep]

26:52.880 --> 26:54.214
[Switch clicks] Okay...

26:54.249 --> 26:57.216
Come on!
How am I supposed to...

26:57.251 --> 26:58.751
[Switch clicks]

27:10.564 --> 27:12.330
Hey.

27:12.365 --> 27:13.898
Wait.

27:13.933 --> 27:16.901
Wait, wait.
Who are you?

27:16.936 --> 27:19.771
I'm the-- I'm the guy.
So where's the--

27:19.805 --> 27:21.773
Hold on. Hold on.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.575
Who sent you?

27:23.609 --> 27:26.678
Who sent me?
Who do you think?

27:26.712 --> 27:31.382
- No. I'm asking you.
- Mike...

27:31.416 --> 27:32.849
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

27:32.884 --> 27:35.052
And this Mike person--

27:35.087 --> 27:37.188
What's his last name?

27:37.222 --> 27:40.791
Lady, I just got off a plane
from New Mexico,

27:40.825 --> 27:42.560
and I got
a 900-mile drive back.

27:42.594 --> 27:44.961
That's 14 hours
if I don't stop.

27:44.995 --> 27:48.331
So, the sooner we do this,
the sooner it's done.

27:52.203 --> 27:55.638
Uh, Ehrmantraut.

27:55.672 --> 27:58.341
Okay? Satisfied?

28:02.078 --> 28:05.380
Sorry, but I'm not gonna
apologize for being careful.

28:05.415 --> 28:07.382
With all that's been happening
around here, for all I knew,

28:07.417 --> 28:09.585
you were one of those undercover
people they send into high schools.

28:09.619 --> 28:13.655
So, yeah, I'll take paranoid any day if
we're getting ganged by prison guards.

28:13.689 --> 28:15.690
Oh, no doubt.

28:15.725 --> 28:17.458
So, uh,
where's the--

28:17.493 --> 28:19.994
Up there.
Number 22356.

28:20.028 --> 28:22.130
That's the one I erased
from the inventory,

28:22.164 --> 28:24.165
so it has to be that one.

28:24.199 --> 28:28.102
- Can you reach it?
- With a forklift.

28:28.137 --> 28:29.803
You got one?

28:49.989 --> 28:52.491
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Stop!

28:52.526 --> 28:54.993
[Liquid sloshes]

28:55.028 --> 28:57.596
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

28:57.631 --> 28:59.097
What?

28:59.132 --> 29:02.201
Please tell me that's
not what I think it is.

29:20.085 --> 29:22.919
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

29:22.953 --> 29:25.489
No. No, of course not.

29:27.258 --> 29:29.326
[Sighs] No, no.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.361
I just...

29:36.866 --> 29:41.904
She and I are
having some issues.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.608
Yeah, yeah. I, uh--
I might've heard

29:45.642 --> 29:47.643
a little bit about that.

29:47.678 --> 29:50.913
I mean, hey, look,
Marie didn't go into detail.

29:50.947 --> 29:52.914
You know, said that,

29:52.948 --> 29:55.183
you know, you guys were...

29:55.218 --> 29:58.119
having some issues.

30:00.556 --> 30:04.659
So, uh, what's the next move?

30:04.694 --> 30:07.995
It may be good to have
her talk to someone.

30:08.030 --> 30:10.997
- Oh, I agree.
- Yeah.

30:11.032 --> 30:12.866
Well, I'm gonna
get on that first thing.

30:12.900 --> 30:14.201
Yeah.

30:14.236 --> 30:16.737
There's Marie's guy, Dave.

30:16.771 --> 30:19.906
She seems really happy
with him.

30:19.941 --> 30:21.908
Not that Marie's
an advertisement

30:21.943 --> 30:24.510
for advanced mental health
or anything.

30:25.679 --> 30:27.313
You know...

30:27.348 --> 30:31.516
I just had no idea
she was taking it this hard.

30:35.988 --> 30:37.989
Some birthday, huh?

30:47.932 --> 30:50.100
She's gonna try
and get some sleep.

30:50.135 --> 30:52.136
Oh, okay.

30:57.876 --> 30:59.343
What was that?

30:59.378 --> 31:03.580
- I don't know.
- I mean, was she trying...?

31:03.614 --> 31:05.782
No, not in
a swimming pool. No.

31:05.816 --> 31:08.418
With all of us there?
No, I don't think so.

31:08.452 --> 31:09.452
[Sniffling]

31:10.454 --> 31:13.055
But, uh, we both, uh,

31:13.090 --> 31:15.392
think that...

31:15.426 --> 31:18.795
she should talk to someone.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.164
I'm gonna get you
Dave's number.

31:22.198 --> 31:23.766
Okay.

31:26.703 --> 31:29.471
Listen, Walt, I--

31:29.506 --> 31:32.073
I can't help but sense

31:32.108 --> 31:34.476
that there may be some issues

31:34.511 --> 31:36.444
between you and Skyler.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.546
None of our business,
of course.

31:38.580 --> 31:41.349
And, Hank, I don't know if you

31:41.383 --> 31:43.785
- picked up on any of--
- He knows--

31:43.819 --> 31:46.187
He knows I know.

31:53.961 --> 31:56.996
These things happen
in a marriage,

31:57.770 --> 31:59.612
but it isn't unfixable.

31:59.634 --> 32:04.504
I think what would
be great is if

32:04.539 --> 32:07.640
you two had some space

32:07.674 --> 32:11.076
to work through this stuff.

32:11.110 --> 32:12.611
So--

32:12.646 --> 32:16.782
And keep an open mind here.

32:16.817 --> 32:19.952
What if we took the kids
for a while?

32:20.954 --> 32:23.322
- Took the kids?
- Absolutely.

32:23.356 --> 32:27.492
We'll look after them for a
day or two, or however long,

32:27.526 --> 32:30.862
and leave you and Skyler

32:30.896 --> 32:33.164
to look after each other.

32:33.198 --> 32:35.633
Uh, that's very generous
of you, Marie,

32:35.668 --> 32:40.203
but I-- I just don't see
how that's a solution.

32:40.238 --> 32:42.005
And-- I mean--

32:42.039 --> 32:46.209
Besides, Junior and Holly--
That's a lot of work.

32:46.244 --> 32:48.011
No, it isn't.

32:48.045 --> 32:50.013
Junior's independent,

32:50.047 --> 32:53.450
and my niece
is only the easiest,

32:53.485 --> 32:56.619
most delicious baby
that was ever born.

32:56.653 --> 32:58.788
- It'll be fun, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. No, yeah.

32:58.822 --> 32:59.789
Yeah.

32:59.823 --> 33:01.791
Absolutely. Yeah.

33:01.825 --> 33:03.459
It's a good idea.

33:03.494 --> 33:05.828
I think it's a great idea.

33:05.863 --> 33:09.832
Just the thing for both of you.

33:15.337 --> 33:17.906
Marie,

33:17.940 --> 33:21.382
this idea--

33:21.717 --> 33:22.976
was it yours?

33:23.078 --> 33:25.847
Actually, it was Skyler's.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.519
Uh-huh.

33:31.553 --> 33:34.288
She really needs this, Walt.

33:36.558 --> 33:38.225
Yep.

33:46.901 --> 33:49.436
I gave Marie bottles.

33:49.470 --> 33:53.039
They'll stop and pick up
diapers on their way.

33:53.073 --> 33:56.175
I spoke with Junior
on the phone,

33:56.209 --> 33:58.377
and after much discussion,

33:58.412 --> 34:00.879
he agreed to swing by tomorrow,
pick up some clothes.

34:00.914 --> 34:05.651
And so, voila, the kids
are out of this environment.

34:05.685 --> 34:08.654
What a coincidence.

34:08.688 --> 34:11.422
I know you're awake.

34:15.360 --> 34:19.464
What was that about?
Can you explain it?

34:20.899 --> 34:24.735
I don't want the children
here anymore.

34:24.770 --> 34:26.771
It isn't safe.

34:26.804 --> 34:31.775
Skyler, we have talked
about this repeatedly.

34:31.809 --> 34:33.777
It has never been more safe.

34:33.811 --> 34:35.712
"Never been"?

34:35.746 --> 34:38.882
A couple weeks ago,
a man was coming to this house

34:38.916 --> 34:41.351
to kill us,
to murder your entire family.

34:41.385 --> 34:44.020
You were in the crawlspace,
screaming.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.222
And I dealt with him.
It's over.

34:46.255 --> 34:47.723
It is not.

34:47.757 --> 34:50.092
You're right back
in the meth business again.

34:50.126 --> 34:53.496
This is different.
Now I'm running things.

34:53.530 --> 34:56.431
So wait.
Now that you're in charge,

34:56.466 --> 35:00.127
it's what, it's gonna be smooth
sailing from here on out?

35:00.331 --> 35:01.538
I don't see why not.

35:01.573 --> 35:05.507
I keep the work
at work, Skyler,

35:05.541 --> 35:07.942
and nothing will ever impact
you or the kids.

35:07.977 --> 35:11.245
You don't know that.
You can't make that promise, Walt.

35:11.279 --> 35:13.781
I can promise you
that Gus Fring is dead.

35:13.816 --> 35:16.183
And he was the threat.
He was the danger.

35:16.218 --> 35:18.820
I thought you were the danger.

35:26.327 --> 35:28.896
Is that what
your pool stunt was about?

35:28.930 --> 35:31.598
Trying to protect
my children from me?

35:31.633 --> 35:33.667
Not just you...

35:33.701 --> 35:35.868
There's blood on my hands too.

35:35.903 --> 35:38.638
What blood? Beneke?

35:38.672 --> 35:41.497
He's in the hospital
because of me.

35:41.680 --> 35:43.782
- No.
- Because of what I did.

35:43.817 --> 35:45.745
Skyler, you can't beat
yourself up over this thing.

35:45.779 --> 35:48.581
Please. You didn't set out
to hurt anybody.

35:48.615 --> 35:51.083
You made a mistake,
and things got out of control,

35:51.117 --> 35:53.785
but you did what you had to do
to protect your family.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.254
And I'm sorry.
That doesn't make you a bad person,

35:56.288 --> 35:57.956
it makes you a human being.

35:57.990 --> 36:01.526
Stop it, Walt.
Just stop.

36:01.561 --> 36:04.062
I don't need to hear any
of your bullshit rationales.

36:04.096 --> 36:05.630
I'm in it now.

36:05.665 --> 36:08.198
I'm compromised.
But I won't--

36:08.232 --> 36:11.168
I will not have my children
living in a house

36:11.202 --> 36:13.103
where dealing drugs

36:13.137 --> 36:15.505
and hurting people
and killing people

36:15.540 --> 36:18.175
is shrugged off
as "shit happens."

36:18.209 --> 36:20.243
We're back at it?
Fine.

36:20.278 --> 36:24.001
But the kids stay away,
and that's that.

36:24.184 --> 36:26.074
That's that?
That's what?

36:26.182 --> 36:27.483
I got them out of this house.

36:27.517 --> 36:29.819
To a sleepover
at their aunt and uncle's?

36:29.853 --> 36:32.088
They spend a day or two,

36:32.122 --> 36:34.824
Junior stays up late watching
movies, and then what happens?

36:34.858 --> 36:37.459
- We'll see.
- No, I'll tell you what happens.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.249
They come home.
To this house.

36:40.284 --> 36:41.396
To their parents who love them.

36:41.430 --> 36:43.932
No. I will not let
our business endanger them.

36:43.967 --> 36:47.569
- How many times do I have to say
that they are not in-- - I said no.

36:47.604 --> 36:50.993
I swear to God,
I won't have them back here.

36:57.412 --> 37:00.247
What are you gonna do
to stop it?

37:02.250 --> 37:06.625
Whatever it takes.
Everything in my power.

37:06.724 --> 37:08.394
Like what? I mean, specificly.

37:08.429 --> 37:09.957
What is your next move?

37:09.992 --> 37:12.258
My next move
is maybe I hurt myself.

37:12.292 --> 37:14.393
Make it clear
we need more time.

37:14.428 --> 37:16.963
Let Hank and Marie see
we're still struggling.

37:16.998 --> 37:18.598
No, more like
you're still struggling.

37:18.633 --> 37:21.034
So maybe next time,
I have you committed.

37:21.068 --> 37:23.670
Put you in some
inpatient facility

37:23.704 --> 37:25.505
while I take care
of the kids myself.

37:25.539 --> 37:27.507
Is that what you want?

37:27.541 --> 37:31.076
So then maybe I show up
with bruises on my neck,

37:31.111 --> 37:33.078
give myself a black eye,

37:33.113 --> 37:34.813
say that you beat me

37:34.848 --> 37:37.650
when you found out
about my lover.

37:39.485 --> 37:42.121
I see.

37:42.155 --> 37:44.455
So you want to involve Ted?

37:44.489 --> 37:45.957
Oh, well, that'll be fun,

37:45.991 --> 37:48.492
bringing the police
up to speed on all of that.

37:48.527 --> 37:51.428
But not as much fun as
telling your 16-year-old son

37:51.463 --> 37:54.298
that his father
is a wife-beater.

37:54.332 --> 37:56.834
Also not a very good plan.
What else you got?

37:56.869 --> 37:59.570
I could send Junior
away to school.

37:59.604 --> 38:01.880
Oh. Now here's
the conversation...

38:02.028 --> 38:05.148
"So, honey, I know you've
only got one year left in high school,

38:05.457 --> 38:07.844
but I would love it so much
if you would drop everything,

38:07.879 --> 38:11.048
leave all your friends behind, and
go to boarding school in Arizona."

38:11.082 --> 38:13.583
You have any other ideas?
Because I'm not hearing

38:13.617 --> 38:15.642
a solution to your problem.

38:16.498 --> 38:18.831
How are you going
to save our kids

38:18.866 --> 38:20.589
from this terrible environment?

38:20.623 --> 38:22.391
- I--
- What are you gonna do?

38:22.425 --> 38:23.859
Are you gonna run off
to France?

38:23.894 --> 38:25.661
Are you gonna close the
curtains, change the locks?

38:25.696 --> 38:27.663
This is a joke.
Come on, Skyler.

38:27.698 --> 38:31.167
You wanna take me on?
You wanna take away my children?

38:32.334 --> 38:35.303
- What's the plan?
- I don't know!

38:35.337 --> 38:37.939
This is the best
I could come up with, okay?

38:37.973 --> 38:41.009
I-- I will count
every minute

38:41.043 --> 38:42.677
that the kids
are away from here,

38:42.712 --> 38:44.612
away from you, as a victory.

38:44.646 --> 38:47.881
But you're right.

38:47.916 --> 38:50.818
It's a bad plan.

38:50.852 --> 38:55.388
I don't have any
of your magic, Walt.

38:55.423 --> 38:57.091
I don't know what to do.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.326
I'm a coward.

38:59.360 --> 39:01.561
I-- I can't go
to the police.

39:01.596 --> 39:03.563
I can't stop
laundering your money.

39:03.598 --> 39:05.497
I can't keep you
out of this house.

39:05.532 --> 39:08.134
I can't even keep you
out of my bed.

39:09.636 --> 39:12.471
All I can do is wait.

39:12.505 --> 39:14.841
That's it.
That's the only good option.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.375
Hold on,

39:16.409 --> 39:18.344
bide my time,

39:18.378 --> 39:20.045
and wait.

39:22.281 --> 39:25.316
Wait for what?
What are you waiting for?

39:26.786 --> 39:30.021
For the cancer to come back.

40:05.953 --> 40:08.921
[Buzzing]

40:17.797 --> 40:19.297
Yeah?

40:20.967 --> 40:23.068
Okay. Okay.

40:23.102 --> 40:25.936
Just relax.
I'm coming.

40:38.684 --> 40:41.285
[Jesse] Look at that.
You tell me what that looks like.

40:41.319 --> 40:43.354
If the DEA's tracking
her barrels,

40:43.388 --> 40:45.222
there goes
our precursor connection.

40:45.257 --> 40:47.724
That's done.
And I'm telling you these days,

40:47.759 --> 40:50.660
chances of getting a new
methylamine hook-up is rare, man.

40:50.695 --> 40:52.729
It's like Bigfoot.
Like unicorn-rare.

40:52.764 --> 40:57.234
Kid, it's just--
You're giving me heartburn here.

40:57.269 --> 40:59.835
GPS on the bottom
of the barrel.

40:59.870 --> 41:02.438
Why didn't they put it inside
where nobody would see it?

41:02.472 --> 41:04.307
Look, it's inside, it gets wet.

41:04.341 --> 41:06.609
They made these things
to put under cars.

41:06.643 --> 41:08.211
They can get wet.

41:08.245 --> 41:09.545
Huh.

41:09.579 --> 41:12.715
Even by cop standards
this is sloppy.

41:12.749 --> 41:14.216
And the other barrels--

41:14.250 --> 41:16.684
They have trackers
on the outside too?

41:16.719 --> 41:19.821
I don't know.
Probably.

41:19.855 --> 41:22.857
- You didn't check any
of the other barrels? - No.

41:22.892 --> 41:25.327
But that's the only one we
could've taken, according to her.

41:25.361 --> 41:27.329
Once we spotted it,
she freaked out,

41:27.363 --> 41:30.398
I put the barrel back,
and we FO'd.

41:30.432 --> 41:32.366
Let me ask you something.

41:32.401 --> 41:34.501
The person
who spotted this--

41:34.536 --> 41:36.537
Was it you or was it her?

41:36.571 --> 41:39.106
Lydia.
She saw it first.

41:40.508 --> 41:42.009
Okay.

41:42.044 --> 41:43.844
She's dead.

41:43.878 --> 41:45.446
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

41:45.480 --> 41:48.548
Lydia planted this thing,
not the cops.

41:48.582 --> 41:50.383
She's thinking
if she makes it look

41:50.418 --> 41:52.385
like her inventory's
being watched

41:52.420 --> 41:55.388
that we'll leave her alone
and take our business elsewhere.

41:55.389 --> 41:56.856
And she's right,

41:56.890 --> 41:59.973
we will be taking
our business elsewhere,

42:00.103 --> 42:02.129
right after I leave her
alone in a ditch.

42:02.164 --> 42:04.529
But wait, hey, if the DEA's
not tracking her stuff,

42:04.564 --> 42:06.631
that's a good thing, right?

42:06.666 --> 42:08.400
I mean, all we gotta do
is tell her to,

42:08.435 --> 42:10.469
you know, cut the crap
and keep the methylamine coming.

42:10.503 --> 42:12.571
You don't know
this woman like I do.

42:12.605 --> 42:15.874
I had a chance to deal with this
before, and I gave her a pass.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.909
That's what I get
for being sexist.

42:17.944 --> 42:19.577
Now, if you'll excuse me...

42:19.611 --> 42:21.446
Mike, you can't just...

42:21.480 --> 42:24.015
Look, that's our precursor.
We need her.

42:24.049 --> 42:27.685
Kid, if we have to ramp down
for a while, so be it.

42:27.719 --> 42:31.122
It beats working with a lunatic
who's gonna get us arrested or killed.

42:31.156 --> 42:33.924
Look, she didn't seem crazy
to me, you know?

42:33.959 --> 42:35.726
She just seemed, like, uptight.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.061
And now you're being sexist.

42:38.096 --> 42:40.664
Trust me, this woman
deserves to die

42:40.699 --> 42:43.133
as much as any man
I've ever met.

42:43.167 --> 42:45.202
No. Wait!

42:45.437 --> 42:47.037
Just wait.

42:47.038 --> 42:49.306
What if this really was
the cops, you know?

42:49.340 --> 42:52.308
- And what if you're wrong about her?
- I'm not wrong.

42:52.342 --> 42:54.644
But what if you are?

42:54.678 --> 42:58.515
Jesse, your misgivings
have been duly noted.

42:58.549 --> 43:01.317
Now move away from me.

43:01.351 --> 43:03.452
No. This is
a voting thing.

43:03.487 --> 43:07.322
- I don't think so.
- I vote it's a voting thing.

43:07.356 --> 43:09.290
Mr. White,
weigh in here, would you?

43:09.325 --> 43:11.693
What do you think?

43:11.728 --> 43:14.462
Mr. White?

43:22.671 --> 43:26.106
The methylamine keeps flowing,
no matter what.

43:26.141 --> 43:29.276
We are not ramping down.

43:29.310 --> 43:32.547
We're just getting started.

43:32.581 --> 43:35.883
Nothing stops this train.

43:35.918 --> 43:38.052
Nothing.

43:39.554 --> 43:42.589
Hey, yo, Mr. White.
Hold up.

43:44.158 --> 43:47.594
I just wanted to say
I liked your idea.

43:47.628 --> 43:50.931
You know, it's pretty, uh...

43:50.965 --> 43:53.499
I think it's the way to go.

43:56.570 --> 43:58.470
Oh, hey, um,

43:58.504 --> 44:02.007
you said it was your--
your birthday, so...

44:04.578 --> 44:06.545
I left the receipt in the box

44:06.580 --> 44:09.014
in case you wanna exchange it.

44:10.149 --> 44:13.918
Anyway, hey, happy birthday.

44:29.401 --> 44:31.168
Hi.

44:37.976 --> 44:41.378
I, uh, stopped by
Hank and Marie's.

44:41.413 --> 44:45.615
Junior is still asking,
"what is going on?"

44:45.649 --> 44:48.384
Nonstop, very insistently.
[Chuckles]

44:48.419 --> 44:50.720
But everything's okay.

44:50.754 --> 44:54.090
They're watching <i>Ratatouille.</i>

44:54.125 --> 44:56.192
It's very sweet.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.995
How are you?

45:07.337 --> 45:10.272
There's gonna be some more
money coming in soon.

45:10.306 --> 45:12.407
Is that okay?

45:14.010 --> 45:15.610
Fine.

45:15.644 --> 45:17.278
Good.

45:20.048 --> 45:22.517
So...

45:22.551 --> 45:25.219
Are you coming to bed?

45:49.942 --> 45:51.943
I wanna show you something.

45:54.413 --> 45:56.614
See that watch?

45:56.649 --> 45:59.784
It's a birthday present.

45:59.818 --> 46:02.820
The person who gave me
this present

46:02.854 --> 46:05.490
wanted me dead too.

46:05.524 --> 46:07.892
Not that long ago,

46:07.926 --> 46:09.959
he pointed a gun
right between my eyes,

46:09.994 --> 46:11.695
right here,

46:11.729 --> 46:14.498
and he threatened to kill me.

46:16.267 --> 46:19.469
He changed his mind
about me, Skyler,

46:20.471 --> 46:22.806
and so will you.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.638
[Ticking]

47:02.244 --> 47:04.044
[Ticking loudly, clicks]

47:05.872 --> 47:10.000
