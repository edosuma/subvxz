Original Air Date on August 22, 2010

00:05.760 --> 00:07.080
So I could teach her to swim.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.210
Yeah.

00:08.220 --> 00:11.420
The big 10 point guard can't swim.

00:12.465 --> 00:13.832
Kim, you are the

00:13.899 --> 00:14.932
only single one.

00:15.000 --> 00:16.400
Yeah.

00:16.468 --> 00:17.902
This is Kim's new

00:17.969 --> 00:18.902
bodyguard.

00:18.970 --> 00:19.903
We have to work

00:19.971 --> 00:21.872
professionally.

00:21.939 --> 00:22.806
Someone who wanted to

00:22.873 --> 00:23.740
get set up with you.

00:23.808 --> 00:25.360
He plays football.

00:25.428 --> 00:26.354
I don't want to date

00:26.422 --> 00:27.222
another football player.

00:27.289 --> 00:29.584
Who cares?

00:29.652 --> 00:32.928
Miles Austin.

00:32.996 --> 00:34.107
My wish would be to

00:34.174 --> 00:35.630
get the hell away from

00:35.698 --> 00:37.275
her family.

00:37.343 --> 00:38.086
Kourt, are you moving

00:38.154 --> 00:39.940
to New York?

00:40.007 --> 00:40.682
She's going

00:40.750 --> 00:41.557
to leave us.

00:41.625 --> 00:42.458
If we're together,

00:42.526 --> 00:43.262
you don't text other

00:43.329 --> 00:44.699
Whores!

00:44.767 --> 00:46.981
This feels really good.

00:47.049 --> 00:48.022
I don't want my wife

00:48.090 --> 00:48.962
fooling around with some

00:49.030 --> 00:50.068
young kid!

00:50.136 --> 00:50.807
Kris I just

00:50.875 --> 00:51.746
feel like everything happens

00:51.814 --> 00:52.752
for a reason.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.192
We've never seen you

00:54.260 --> 00:55.498
and dad fight like that.

00:55.566 --> 00:56.608
I'm just sick and

00:56.676 --> 01:00.487
tired of all of this!

01:02.531 --> 01:03.334
for dinner.

01:03.402 --> 01:04.339
I'm just gonna make Kendall's

01:04.407 --> 01:05.477
favorite pasta if nobody else

01:05.545 --> 01:06.548
has a vote.

01:06.616 --> 01:07.285
It's not my favorite

01:07.353 --> 01:08.056
pasta anymore.

01:08.124 --> 01:08.760
You make it every single

01:08.827 --> 01:09.731
night, ma.

01:09.798 --> 01:10.768
Okay, well, I don't

01:10.836 --> 01:11.706
make it every night.

01:11.773 --> 01:12.506
You actually do make

01:12.574 --> 01:13.644
the same food every

01:13.714 --> 01:14.717
single night.

01:14.784 --> 01:15.618
Okay, now nobody gets a

01:15.688 --> 01:16.824
vote because I'm tired of the

01:16.891 --> 01:18.595
bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch.

01:18.663 --> 01:19.365
May I have your

01:19.433 --> 01:20.369
attention?

01:20.436 --> 01:21.105
What?

01:21.173 --> 01:21.842
As some of you may

01:21.910 --> 01:23.480
know, a few weeks ago...

01:23.548 --> 01:24.753
You won a gold medal.

01:24.820 --> 01:27.293
No. My wedding ring

01:27.361 --> 01:27.829
broke.

01:27.897 --> 01:28.833
What?!

01:28.900 --> 01:29.869
It did?

01:29.937 --> 01:30.670
I've never had my

01:30.739 --> 01:31.875
wedding ring off in 19 and a

01:31.943 --> 01:32.878
half years.

01:32.946 --> 01:34.448
I got the ring back.

01:34.516 --> 01:36.421
I think what we should do is we

01:36.488 --> 01:38.226
should have a little ceremony,

01:38.294 --> 01:40.332
renew our vows.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.602
Come on in here, honey.

01:41.669 --> 01:42.873
I just Up

01:42.941 --> 01:44.812
the cake, so just hang on,

01:44.880 --> 01:46.149
Romeo.

01:46.217 --> 01:46.919
What an annoying

01:46.986 --> 01:47.821
woman.

01:47.889 --> 01:48.656
Are you sure you want

01:48.723 --> 01:49.760
to get remarried right now?

01:49.828 --> 01:50.728
Okay, let's do this.

01:50.797 --> 01:51.899
I gotta make pasta.

01:51.967 --> 01:52.633
All right, stand

01:52.701 --> 01:53.035
right here.

01:53.103 --> 01:53.837
Hold Mason.

01:53.905 --> 01:55.541
He's my best man.

01:55.608 --> 01:56.276
He holds the ring.

01:56.344 --> 01:57.847
Kim, don't do that!

01:57.915 --> 01:58.748
Come on, honey.

01:58.817 --> 01:59.550
I'm wearing white.

01:59.618 --> 02:01.857
She's wearing white.

02:01.925 --> 02:02.859
I have gathered you

02:02.927 --> 02:05.398
all here today for this joyous

02:05.466 --> 02:06.534
occasion.

02:06.601 --> 02:07.904
I, with this ring...

02:07.972 --> 02:09.074
I, with this ring...

02:09.140 --> 02:09.942
...Promise to love

02:10.009 --> 02:10.710
you...

02:10.779 --> 02:11.512
...Promise to love

02:11.580 --> 02:11.880
you...

02:11.948 --> 02:13.116
...Be kind to you...

02:13.184 --> 02:13.884
...Be kind to you...

02:13.952 --> 02:14.685
...Always have

02:14.753 --> 02:15.387
sex with you.

02:15.455 --> 02:16.356
Kris ...Always

02:16.424 --> 02:17.125
have sex with you.

02:17.192 --> 02:19.129
Please say, "I do."

02:19.196 --> 02:20.731
I do.

02:20.800 --> 02:21.935
Yay!

02:22.002 --> 02:22.837
You have to kiss

02:22.904 --> 02:23.438
first.

02:23.505 --> 02:24.273
I don't think he

02:24.340 --> 02:25.141
can lift her.

02:25.209 --> 02:26.677
This is all awkward.

02:26.745 --> 02:27.580
You weren't this

02:27.647 --> 02:28.951
heavy before.

02:29.018 --> 02:32.292
This is weird.

02:32.359 --> 02:33.294
Captioning sponsored by

02:33.361 --> 02:37.369
bunim-murray productions

02:42.279 --> 02:43.480
He wants a boob, honey.

02:43.548 --> 02:46.920
You don't have a boob, okay?

02:46.988 --> 02:47.956
hi, how are

02:48.023 --> 02:49.191
you?

02:49.259 --> 02:50.962
What are ya doin'?

02:51.030 --> 02:52.331
Mom, one time we

02:52.399 --> 02:54.369
were fighting about Scott, and

02:54.436 --> 02:56.240
she was like saying that

02:56.307 --> 02:57.910
that's how Scott talks.

02:57.978 --> 02:58.744
Scott doesn't talk

02:58.812 --> 02:59.279
like that.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.014
Kris he's

03:00.082 --> 03:01.149
a gangsta.

03:01.217 --> 03:01.916
Scott doesn't have

03:01.984 --> 03:02.918
an accent, but he has a

03:02.986 --> 03:04.889
high-pitched voice.

03:04.957 --> 03:05.790
Kris no,

03:05.859 --> 03:06.391
he has an accent.

03:06.459 --> 03:07.928
And he wants a piece of pizza.

03:07.996 --> 03:08.930
Ever since Scott

03:08.998 --> 03:10.566
and I got back from Miami, we

03:10.634 --> 03:11.635
probably see each other every

03:11.703 --> 03:12.837
couple days.

03:12.906 --> 03:14.208
I think it's important that

03:14.275 --> 03:15.510
Scott sees Mason whenever

03:15.577 --> 03:16.545
he wants.

03:16.612 --> 03:18.781
Scott has definitely been making

03:18.849 --> 03:20.784
some great steps towards

03:20.852 --> 03:21.952
bettering himself.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.688
He's been sober since Miami.

03:23.756 --> 03:24.523
Hi, Buddy.

03:24.591 --> 03:25.525
I'm also selling my

03:25.592 --> 03:27.395
condo right now, and I've

03:27.462 --> 03:28.797
decided that it's best that I

03:28.866 --> 03:31.335
live with Khloe for now, where

03:31.402 --> 03:32.804
Rob's there, Khloe's there,

03:32.872 --> 03:33.772
lamar's there.

03:33.840 --> 03:34.975
There's plenty of extra hands to

03:35.043 --> 03:36.511
help me out with Mason.

03:36.578 --> 03:38.514
I've given Scott so

03:38.582 --> 03:39.983
many chances.

03:40.051 --> 03:42.921
I used to live with Scott.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.557
It's all, but he's always,

03:44.625 --> 03:45.625
"I'm trying,

03:45.693 --> 03:46.393
I'm trying."

03:46.461 --> 03:47.795
It's always that.

03:47.863 --> 03:48.830
I'm over it.

03:48.898 --> 03:49.765
Like you know what?

03:49.832 --> 03:52.035
It's-- people have their limits.

03:52.103 --> 03:54.940
Scott has messed up

03:55.008 --> 03:56.475
consistently.

03:57.946 --> 03:58.779
Literally, it's like

03:58.847 --> 03:59.780
a merry-go-round.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.517
It happens every

04:01.584 --> 04:02.852
four to six months.

04:02.920 --> 04:03.787
Can I get you to shut

04:03.854 --> 04:04.989
your Up?

04:05.057 --> 04:06.691
So if anyone thinks

04:06.759 --> 04:07.793
that I'm being a little harsh, a

04:07.860 --> 04:10.697
little aggressive, please spend

04:10.765 --> 04:11.799
a day in my shoes, and maybe

04:11.866 --> 04:13.435
you'll feel the exact same way.

04:13.502 --> 04:14.836
We're supposed to

04:14.905 --> 04:16.406
accept who he is and these

04:16.474 --> 04:17.541
outbursts and things that

04:17.608 --> 04:18.743
happen.

04:18.810 --> 04:20.779
And then it's our turn to have

04:20.846 --> 04:22.982
a moment, he gets to walk away.

04:23.050 --> 04:24.250
I mean, why are we supposed

04:24.318 --> 04:25.584
to put up with it and not

04:25.652 --> 04:27.519
walk away?

04:27.587 --> 04:28.921
In the big picture,

04:28.988 --> 04:30.622
when you are dating somebody,

04:30.689 --> 04:32.722
it's as good as the relationship

04:32.790 --> 04:34.255
will ever get.

04:34.323 --> 04:34.989
Ever.

04:35.057 --> 04:35.890
Ever.

04:35.957 --> 04:37.257
You get married to him, it's

04:37.325 --> 04:38.992
only gonna make it more

04:39.060 --> 04:39.993
difficult 'cause now you got a

04:40.061 --> 04:42.063
contract.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.369
This is so beautiful.

04:49.437 --> 04:50.537
This is like we're in Italy,

04:50.604 --> 04:51.237
honey.

04:51.305 --> 04:52.038
It <i>is</i> like in Italy.

04:52.106 --> 04:54.039
It's gorgeous.

04:55.541 --> 04:56.474
Come in!

04:56.541 --> 04:57.441
Hey, Kim, this is

04:57.509 --> 05:00.544
absolutely gorgeous!

05:00.612 --> 05:01.412
Thank you!

05:01.480 --> 05:02.946
Do you love it?

05:03.014 --> 05:05.415
This is amazing!

05:05.483 --> 05:06.649
So a lot has gone on

05:06.717 --> 05:07.950
in the past month or so

05:08.018 --> 05:10.219
since Miami.

05:10.286 --> 05:11.286
Reggie and I broke up.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.320
And at first it was really

05:12.388 --> 05:13.788
tough living your life so

05:13.856 --> 05:15.757
public, seeing your relationship

05:15.825 --> 05:18.827
play out in all the tabloids.

05:18.894 --> 05:20.962
But now I am over it.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.697
I'm single and I am absolutely

05:23.765 --> 05:25.031
loving life.

05:30.103 --> 05:31.270
Since I'm not in a

05:31.338 --> 05:32.972
relationship, the one thing I've

05:33.039 --> 05:35.007
just been diving into and

05:35.074 --> 05:36.441
obsessed with right now is my

05:36.509 --> 05:37.442
new house.

05:37.510 --> 05:38.610
Hey, the maceman

05:38.678 --> 05:39.511
is here.

05:39.578 --> 05:40.245
What's happening, Buddy?

05:40.313 --> 05:42.013
Kim, this looks so

05:42.081 --> 05:43.014
amazing.

05:43.081 --> 05:43.981
It's kind of like

05:44.049 --> 05:44.982
my relationship.

05:45.049 --> 05:46.783
All my clutches will go there.

05:46.851 --> 05:48.251
Oh, my God,

05:48.319 --> 05:49.985
I love the chandelier!

05:50.053 --> 05:51.353
I'm like nurturing it

05:51.421 --> 05:52.787
and spending a lot of time there

05:52.855 --> 05:54.021
and just making sure that

05:54.089 --> 05:55.789
everything is perfect.

05:55.857 --> 05:56.690
Masey, look what you

05:56.758 --> 05:58.025
left at home!

05:58.092 --> 05:58.992
Mr. Roberto...

05:59.060 --> 06:00.360
It's my new boyfriend.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.161
This house is

06:02.229 --> 06:03.162
stunning.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.397
You guys need to get out

06:04.464 --> 06:04.964
of here.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.365
This room is just to look at,

06:06.433 --> 06:07.266
not to sit in.

06:07.333 --> 06:08.233
Let's check the

06:08.301 --> 06:09.301
backyard out before we get in

06:09.368 --> 06:10.168
trouble for sitting on

06:10.236 --> 06:13.671
the furniture.

06:13.739 --> 06:14.572
All right, let's go.

06:14.639 --> 06:15.606
There's the path.

06:15.674 --> 06:16.306
Yeah.

06:16.374 --> 06:18.942
This is fantastic.

06:19.010 --> 06:19.976
Do you guys have to wear

06:20.044 --> 06:21.211
your heels and stuff on the

06:21.278 --> 06:22.278
grass?

06:22.346 --> 06:22.978
Actually, you should

06:23.046 --> 06:23.779
walk on the grass with your

06:23.847 --> 06:24.947
heels 'cause it will aerate

06:25.014 --> 06:25.881
the lawn.

06:25.948 --> 06:26.681
Okay, seriously, you're

06:26.749 --> 06:27.948
getting crumbs everywhere.

06:28.016 --> 06:28.949
Look at this!

06:29.016 --> 06:30.250
So let's not eat

06:30.317 --> 06:31.517
anymore in Kim's house.

06:31.585 --> 06:33.519
This'll be fun.

06:33.587 --> 06:34.520
Kourtney!

06:34.587 --> 06:35.420
When my whole family

06:35.488 --> 06:36.488
comes over, they are nothing

06:36.556 --> 06:37.723
but obnoxious.

06:37.790 --> 06:38.790
Fingerprints, fingerprints,

06:38.858 --> 06:39.824
people.

06:39.892 --> 06:42.159
Seriously, guys, paws off.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.293
Paws off the window.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.194
Oh, why did you

06:44.262 --> 06:44.962
invite us over?

06:45.030 --> 06:46.297
I want you to see it.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.498
I said, "look, don't touch."

06:56.904 --> 06:57.637
Hi.

06:57.705 --> 06:58.338
Hi.

06:58.406 --> 06:58.971
How are you?

06:59.039 --> 06:59.906
Good. How are you?

06:59.974 --> 07:01.842
So, basically, I wanted to go

07:01.909 --> 07:03.242
back to what you were saying

07:03.310 --> 07:04.243
initially in terms of your

07:04.311 --> 07:06.678
insecurities and being thrust

07:06.746 --> 07:09.113
into this bigger family.

07:09.181 --> 07:09.947
Right.

07:10.015 --> 07:10.881
While Scott and I

07:10.949 --> 07:12.215
are kind of working on things,

07:12.283 --> 07:13.383
we've been going to therapy

07:13.450 --> 07:14.784
twice a week.

07:14.852 --> 07:15.918
I don't know where our

07:15.986 --> 07:18.421
relationship stands, but we're

07:18.488 --> 07:19.556
both working on it.

07:19.623 --> 07:20.490
I love Scott.

07:20.558 --> 07:22.358
He's Mason's father, and we're

07:22.426 --> 07:23.793
both doing our best.

07:23.861 --> 07:24.760
How do you feel about

07:24.828 --> 07:25.961
being part of a big family?

07:26.029 --> 07:27.229
I mean, is that something that

07:27.296 --> 07:29.197
is attractive to you, or is it

07:29.265 --> 07:30.331
something that like, "get me out

07:30.399 --> 07:31.666
of here"?

07:31.734 --> 07:32.433
Yeah, that's not

07:32.501 --> 07:32.933
for me.

07:33.001 --> 07:33.934
It's not for you.

07:34.002 --> 07:34.935
Him and my brother

07:35.002 --> 07:35.869
used to be close.

07:35.937 --> 07:36.936
Him and my sister Khloe used

07:37.004 --> 07:37.771
to be close.

07:37.838 --> 07:38.538
We used to all three

07:38.606 --> 07:39.305
live together.

07:39.373 --> 07:40.406
They like despise each other

07:40.474 --> 07:41.340
now.

07:41.408 --> 07:41.974
How do you feel

07:42.042 --> 07:42.708
about that?

07:42.776 --> 07:43.709
How do you deal with it?

07:43.777 --> 07:44.543
It's like I have to

07:44.611 --> 07:46.678
live two different scenarios.

07:46.746 --> 07:47.946
Right, two separate

07:48.014 --> 07:48.947
lives, in essence, with

07:49.015 --> 07:50.015
your partner.

07:50.082 --> 07:50.782
Right.

07:50.850 --> 07:51.616
I'd like to know from

07:51.684 --> 07:52.817
you, you know, what are <i>your</i>

07:52.885 --> 07:54.185
<i>expectations, what are your</i>

07:54.253 --> 07:55.720
<i>needs in the relationship?</i>

07:55.787 --> 07:56.954
<i>The only thing I want</i>

07:57.022 --> 07:59.956
<i>is to be treated like the man</i>

08:00.024 --> 08:01.925
<i>that everybody's asking of me.</i>

08:01.992 --> 08:02.725
<i>Once you've broken</i>

08:02.793 --> 08:05.894
<i>trust, and you start thinking in</i>

08:05.962 --> 08:06.829
<i>your mind, "I want to be a</i>

08:06.896 --> 08:07.729
<i>better person, I want to be</i>

08:07.797 --> 08:09.130
<i>a better dad," people aren't</i>

08:09.198 --> 08:10.598
<i>automatically gonna go, "oh,</i>

08:10.666 --> 08:11.466
<i>Scott, that's so great!</i>

08:11.534 --> 08:12.734
<i>We're so happy for you."</i>

08:12.801 --> 08:13.768
<i>You know, they're gonna be</i>

08:13.836 --> 08:14.869
<i>really cautious.</i>

08:14.936 --> 08:16.136
<i>That becomes challenging for the</i>

08:16.204 --> 08:19.438
<i>two of you.</i>

<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

08:31.517 --> 08:32.318
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

08:32.385 --> 08:33.385

<i>Yeah.</i>

08:37.724 --> 08:38.457
<i>Do you know what I</i>

08:38.524 --> 08:39.390
<i>realized when I was driving</i>

08:39.457 --> 08:39.924
<i>up here?</i>

08:39.991 --> 08:40.859
<i>What?</i>

08:40.926 --> 08:41.826
<i>I drove by the house</i>

08:41.894 --> 08:42.693
<i>that daddy and I used to</i>

08:42.760 --> 08:43.193
<i>live in.</i>

08:43.261 --> 08:44.227
<i>And then Bruce and I used to</i>

08:44.296 --> 08:44.995
<i>live next door.</i>

08:45.063 --> 08:45.796
<i>I know.</i>

08:45.864 --> 08:46.563
<i>That was our first</i>

08:46.631 --> 08:47.197
<i>house.</i>

08:47.265 --> 08:47.964
<i>We rented that house before we--</i>

08:48.032 --> 08:48.965
<i>That's why I knew that</i>

08:49.033 --> 08:50.566
<i>this was like meant to be.</i>

08:50.634 --> 08:51.567
<i>We have like the best memories</i>

08:51.634 --> 08:52.467
<i>here.</i>

08:52.535 --> 08:53.435
<i>Kim, you have to have</i>

08:53.503 --> 08:55.171
<i>like a housewarming party.</i>

08:55.238 --> 08:56.305
<i>I don't want anyone</i>

08:56.373 --> 08:57.607
<i>over, never.</i>

08:57.674 --> 08:59.141
<i>Ou have a huge,</i>

08:59.209 --> 09:00.509
<i>beautiful new house.</i>

09:00.577 --> 09:01.310
<i>It won't be too</i>

09:01.377 --> 09:02.310
<i>beautiful after everyone comes</i>

09:02.378 --> 09:03.645
<i>and messes it up.</i>

09:03.712 --> 09:04.679
<i>It's a party-- with</i>

09:04.746 --> 09:05.613
<i>adults.</i>

09:05.680 --> 09:06.613
<i>It's not a bunch of teenagers</i>

09:06.681 --> 09:07.514
<i>running around.</i>

09:07.582 --> 09:09.315
<i>I know, but like I just</i>

09:09.383 --> 09:11.151
<i>don't like people in my space,</i>

09:11.218 --> 09:11.884
<i>you know?</i>

09:11.952 --> 09:13.820
<i>Kim, I'll make it easy.</i>

09:13.887 --> 09:15.354
<i>I'll do all the planning.</i>

09:15.422 --> 09:16.221
<i>We'll have everybody over.</i>

09:16.289 --> 09:16.921
<i>It'll be fun.</i>

09:16.989 --> 09:18.789
<i>Have some fun once in a while.</i>

09:18.857 --> 09:19.623
<i>Fine.</i>

09:19.691 --> 09:20.657
<i>Okay, but it has to be like</i>

09:20.725 --> 09:21.725
<i>normal hours.</i>

09:21.793 --> 09:22.526
<i>I don't want to like piss off</i>

09:22.594 --> 09:23.527
<i>my neighbors.</i>

09:23.595 --> 09:24.495
<i>Kim, it's not animal</i>

09:24.562 --> 09:25.829
<i>house.</i>

09:25.897 --> 09:26.763
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

09:26.831 --> 09:27.664
<i>All right, I'll do</i>

09:27.732 --> 09:28.264
<i>a list.</i>

09:28.332 --> 09:28.898
<i>I'll bring Lisa over.</i>

09:28.966 --> 09:29.832
<i>I'll get the caterer.</i>

09:29.899 --> 09:30.733
<i>We're having cocktails and</i>

09:30.800 --> 09:31.833
<i>hors d'oeuvres, that's it.</i>

09:31.901 --> 09:33.901
<i>Everybody out of here by 10:30.</i>

09:33.969 --> 09:34.935
<i>Fine.</i>

09:35.003 --> 09:36.403
<i>All right.</i>

09:49.347 --> 09:50.180
<i>Ooh, think that's</i>

09:50.248 --> 09:51.749
<i>the Gate.</i>

09:51.816 --> 09:53.317
<i>Hello.</i>

09:53.385 --> 09:55.452
<i>Khlo, how do I open the Gate?</i>

09:55.519 --> 09:56.686
<i>For who?</i>

09:56.754 --> 09:57.453
<i>Scott's here to</i>

09:57.521 --> 09:59.121
<i>take us to lunch.</i>

09:59.189 --> 09:59.955
<i>I'll just buzz you out</i>

10:00.023 --> 10:00.923
<i>when you go out there.</i>

10:00.990 --> 10:01.790
<i>Well, he was going</i>

10:01.858 --> 10:02.491
<i>to come help me get out of the</i>

10:02.558 --> 10:03.425
<i>house.</i>

10:03.493 --> 10:05.193
<i>I do believe Scott has</i>

10:05.261 --> 10:06.861
<i>a lot of negativity around him.</i>

10:06.929 --> 10:07.796
<i>How do I open it?</i>

10:07.863 --> 10:08.363
<i>You don't.</i>

10:08.430 --> 10:09.263
<i>Just turn it off speaker.</i>

10:09.331 --> 10:10.664
<i>You're mature.</i>

10:10.732 --> 10:11.665
<i>And since lamar's in</i>

10:11.733 --> 10:12.833
<i>the playoffs, and the last thing</i>

10:12.900 --> 10:13.800
<i>he needs is negative energy.</i>

10:13.868 --> 10:15.301
<i>Scott is not allowed in my</i>

10:15.369 --> 10:16.869
<i>house, point-blank.</i>

10:16.937 --> 10:18.637
<i>He's a negative awful person, so</i>

10:18.705 --> 10:19.971
<i>yeah, I don't want him in here.</i>

10:20.039 --> 10:20.972
<i>Khloe is being</i>

10:21.040 --> 10:22.741
<i>extremely immature, and won't</i>

10:22.808 --> 10:24.909
<i>even let Scott drive on her</i>

10:24.977 --> 10:25.977
<i>driveway.</i>

10:26.044 --> 10:28.379
<i>Which only burdens me.</i>

10:28.447 --> 10:29.347
<i>What is Scott going to do in</i>

10:29.414 --> 10:30.948
<i>here by helping me out the door?</i>

10:31.015 --> 10:32.316
<i>I don't need things to make my</i>

10:32.383 --> 10:33.649
<i>life any harder.</i>

10:33.717 --> 10:34.516
<i>Bye, kourt.</i>

10:34.584 --> 10:35.617
<i>Thanks, gem.</i>

10:35.685 --> 10:36.585
<i>You're welcome.</i>

10:36.652 --> 10:39.521
<i>Kourtney is so annoying.</i>

10:39.589 --> 10:41.289
<i>There's red wine here.</i>

10:41.357 --> 10:42.490
<i>I didn't want to have this</i>

10:42.558 --> 10:43.290
<i>party, so you need to help me</i>

10:43.358 --> 10:43.991
<i>clean up.</i>

10:44.058 --> 10:44.958
<i>This was your bright idea.</i>

10:45.026 --> 10:46.960
<i>Merry maid Kim is like</i>

10:47.028 --> 10:48.361
<i>turning into a lunatic.</i>

10:48.429 --> 10:49.295
<i>Why would I want</i>

10:49.363 --> 10:50.597
<i>someone like that in my house?</i>

10:50.664 --> 10:51.531
<i>Scott just wants to</i>

10:51.598 --> 10:52.998
<i>come say good night to his son.</i>

10:53.066 --> 10:53.933
<i>If you want to stay at</i>

10:54.000 --> 10:54.800
<i>my house, he can't come there.</i>

10:54.868 --> 10:55.801
<i>There's rules.</i>

10:55.869 --> 10:56.635
<i>Okay, well, I don't</i>

10:56.703 --> 10:58.003
<i>need to be living under rules.</i>

10:58.070 --> 10:59.003
<i>Fine, then don't.</i>

10:59.071 --> 11:00.638
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

11:07.257 --> 11:09.157
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

11:09.225 --> 11:10.658
<i>I just hate staying</i>

11:10.726 --> 11:12.393
<i>in this nasty house.</i>

11:12.460 --> 11:13.193
<i>Why?</i>

11:13.261 --> 11:15.728
<i>Because Khloe is so</i>

11:15.796 --> 11:16.729
<i>damn immature.</i>

11:16.797 --> 11:18.664
<i>She just needs to worry about</i>

11:18.732 --> 11:20.666
<i>herself and lamar and like her</i>

11:20.734 --> 11:22.568
<i>own life, and stop putting all</i>

11:22.636 --> 11:24.336
<i>this negative energy on mine.</i>

11:24.404 --> 11:25.270
<i>I'm not taking sides.</i>

11:25.338 --> 11:26.504
<i>Like, yeah, Scott pisses me off</i>

11:26.572 --> 11:27.672
<i>sometimes, but Scott's the</i>

11:27.740 --> 11:28.973
<i>father of your child.</i>

11:29.041 --> 11:30.007
<i>She's got to be understanding</i>

11:30.075 --> 11:32.142
<i>and be supportive and she's not.</i>

11:32.210 --> 11:34.143
<i>Mason's the number one priority.</i>

11:34.211 --> 11:34.811
<i>Right, and I'm</i>

11:34.879 --> 11:35.645
<i>trying to do what's best</i>

11:35.713 --> 11:36.413
<i>for him.</i>

11:36.480 --> 11:37.347
<i>If Scott isn't what's best for</i>

11:37.415 --> 11:38.381
<i>him, I'm not going to have him</i>

11:38.449 --> 11:39.315
<i>in his life.</i>

11:39.383 --> 11:40.116
<i>Khloe needs to learn</i>

11:40.184 --> 11:41.050
<i>that what she's doing isn't</i>

11:41.118 --> 11:42.051
<i>fair, especially to her sister.</i>

11:42.119 --> 11:43.586
<i>Right.</i>

11:43.654 --> 11:44.487
<i>I love you.</i>

11:44.554 --> 11:45.354
<i>Love you.</i>

11:45.422 --> 11:47.389
<i>Good night.</i>

11:53.327 --> 11:54.727
<i>Kimmy, it's me.</i>

11:54.795 --> 11:56.262
<i>Kim.</i>

11:56.330 --> 11:58.530
<i>Are you still unpacking?</i>

11:58.597 --> 11:59.731
<i>Yes.</i>

11:59.798 --> 12:01.132
<i>I've asked Bruce to come over to</i>

12:01.200 --> 12:03.067
<i>help me party-proof my house</i>

12:03.135 --> 12:04.702
<i>before my mom gets there,</i>

12:04.769 --> 12:05.936
<i>because as soon as she gets</i>

12:06.004 --> 12:07.571
<i>there, all my ideas will be</i>

12:07.639 --> 12:08.738
<i>thrown out the door.</i>

12:08.806 --> 12:09.972
<i>I rented these things right</i>

12:10.040 --> 12:11.240
<i>here, you know, like from a</i>

12:11.308 --> 12:12.241
<i>movie theater.</i>

12:12.308 --> 12:13.008
<i>Go ahead.</i>

12:13.076 --> 12:13.709
<i>And I want to put them</i>

12:13.777 --> 12:14.977
<i>in front of like the grass</i>

12:15.045 --> 12:17.246
<i>area and in front of my--</i>

12:17.314 --> 12:17.980
<i>You mean like nobody</i>

12:18.047 --> 12:19.348
<i>can walk on the grass?</i>

12:19.415 --> 12:20.949
<i>I know I'm being way</i>

12:21.017 --> 12:22.919
<i>over the top, but I need to have</i>

12:22.987 --> 12:25.590
<i>some control at some point.</i>

12:28.460 --> 12:29.693
<i>Voil?</i>

12:29.761 --> 12:30.694
<i>Can we set up the shoe</i>

12:30.761 --> 12:31.694
<i>racks?</i>

12:31.762 --> 12:32.662
<i>You're actually going</i>

12:32.730 --> 12:33.696
<i>to have people take their shoes</i>

12:33.763 --> 12:35.030
<i>off when they come to the party?</i>

12:35.098 --> 12:36.732
<i>Of course.</i>

12:42.737 --> 12:44.671
<i>Ooh, we got gas.</i>

12:44.739 --> 12:47.574
<i>Aw, oh, oh.</i>

12:47.642 --> 12:48.642
<i>Hello?</i>

12:48.709 --> 12:49.543
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

12:49.611 --> 12:50.677
<i>Hey, Kim.</i>

12:50.745 --> 12:51.645
<i>Wait, shoes off.</i>

12:51.712 --> 12:53.179
<i>On the racks, on the racks.</i>

12:53.247 --> 12:54.446
<i>Everyone is not coming</i>

12:54.514 --> 12:55.681
<i>to your party in a cocktail</i>

12:55.748 --> 12:57.082
<i>dress, Kim, and taking off their</i>

12:57.149 --> 12:58.382
<i>shoes.</i>

12:58.450 --> 12:59.716
<i>And Bruce is taking these stupid</i>

12:59.784 --> 13:01.285
<i>things out to the garage.</i>

13:01.352 --> 13:02.452
<i>They're not staying here while</i>

13:02.519 --> 13:03.953
<i>your guests come in and have</i>

13:04.020 --> 13:05.521
<i>barriers so they can't get into</i>

13:05.588 --> 13:06.355
<i>your rooms.</i>

13:06.423 --> 13:07.156
<i>It's rude.</i>

13:07.223 --> 13:07.957
<i>I don't want people in</i>

13:08.024 --> 13:08.691
<i>there.</i>

13:08.758 --> 13:09.692
<i>There are sprinklers out that</i>

13:09.759 --> 13:10.692
<i>side.</i>

13:10.760 --> 13:11.526
<i>They're going to get mud all</i>

13:11.594 --> 13:13.428
<i>over my brand-new white carpets.</i>

13:13.496 --> 13:14.262
<i>Kim, you're turning</i>

13:14.330 --> 13:15.229
<i>into an old Lady.</i>

13:15.297 --> 13:16.563
<i>Why don't you just put plastic</i>

13:16.631 --> 13:17.664
<i>on your couches?</i>

13:17.732 --> 13:18.598
<i>Kim, if you're going to own a</i>

13:18.666 --> 13:19.633
<i>home, you have to learn how to</i>

13:19.700 --> 13:21.535
<i>entertain.</i>

13:25.205 --> 13:26.472
<i>Hello?</i>

13:26.540 --> 13:27.640
<i>Hey, khlo.</i>

13:27.707 --> 13:28.641
<i>Where are you?</i>

13:28.709 --> 13:29.875
<i>Up here.</i>

13:29.943 --> 13:30.642
<i>Kim, you've got to</i>

13:30.710 --> 13:31.643
<i>get ready.</i>

13:31.711 --> 13:32.577
<i>You know what?</i>

13:32.645 --> 13:33.578
<i>I'm totally fine.</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:35.446
<i>Me and masey are just chillin'.</i>

13:37.015 --> 13:37.915
<i>Hello.</i>

13:37.982 --> 13:40.417
<i>I'm just hanging out at Kim's.</i>

13:40.485 --> 13:42.185
<i>Yeah, that would be nice.</i>

13:42.253 --> 13:45.022
<i>We'll be at Khloe's after.</i>

13:45.090 --> 13:45.924
<i>Who's that?</i>

13:45.992 --> 13:47.125
<i>Scott.</i>

13:47.193 --> 13:47.792
<i>Scott's not coming</i>

13:47.860 --> 13:48.659
<i>over.</i>

13:48.727 --> 13:49.994
<i>I'm serious.</i>

13:50.061 --> 13:50.661
<i>Tell him no.</i>

13:50.729 --> 13:51.328
<i>All right, I'll</i>

13:51.396 --> 13:52.396
<i>call you when I leave here.</i>

13:52.464 --> 13:53.464
<i>It's my house.</i>

13:53.531 --> 13:54.464
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

13:54.532 --> 13:55.665
<i>Why would you care if you're not</i>

13:55.733 --> 13:56.366
<i>going to be there?</i>

13:56.434 --> 13:57.367
<i>Because it's still my</i>

13:57.434 --> 13:58.001
<i>house.</i>

13:58.068 --> 13:59.001
<i>Do you not get it?</i>

13:59.069 --> 13:59.936
<i>Why would I want someone like</i>

14:00.003 --> 14:01.237
<i>that in my house?</i>

14:01.305 --> 14:03.072
<i>I just came before the game-- I</i>

14:03.139 --> 14:04.706
<i>wanted to say congrats on your</i>

14:04.774 --> 14:05.640
<i>housewarming.</i>

14:05.708 --> 14:06.741
<i>Have fun.</i>

14:06.809 --> 14:08.042
<i>And kourt, he's just not coming</i>

14:08.110 --> 14:09.043
<i>over.</i>

14:09.111 --> 14:10.211
<i>So I would call him back.</i>

14:10.279 --> 14:11.245
<i>That doesn't even</i>

14:11.313 --> 14:12.012
<i>make sense.</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:12.946
<i>Like why would that affect you</i>

14:13.014 --> 14:14.114
<i>in any way?</i>

14:14.181 --> 14:14.814
<i>I didn't think this</i>

14:14.882 --> 14:15.882
<i>was continuously going to be</i>

14:15.950 --> 14:16.716
<i>such an issue.</i>

14:16.784 --> 14:17.650
<i>Just respect that I don't want</i>

14:17.718 --> 14:18.651
<i>him over and don't bring him by</i>

14:18.718 --> 14:19.985
<i>and try to be Shady.</i>

14:20.053 --> 14:21.052
<i>If you want to stay at my house,</i>

14:21.120 --> 14:21.953
<i>he can't come there.</i>

14:22.021 --> 14:22.720
<i>There's rules.</i>

14:22.788 --> 14:24.188
<i>Okay, well, I'm 31.</i>

14:24.255 --> 14:25.255
<i>I don't need to be living under</i>

14:25.323 --> 14:26.222
<i>rules.</i>

14:26.290 --> 14:27.156
<i>Fine, then don't.</i>

14:27.224 --> 14:27.723
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

14:27.791 --> 14:30.125
<i>Have fun.</i>

14:32.694 --> 14:34.361
<i>I am so upset with my</i>

14:34.429 --> 14:35.396
<i>mom right now.</i>

14:35.463 --> 14:38.233
<i>Here we go!</i>

14:38.300 --> 14:39.267
<i>What are you doing?</i>

14:39.335 --> 14:40.167
<i>Finishing packing.</i>

14:40.235 --> 14:41.435
<i>Come on, Kourtney.</i>

14:41.503 --> 14:42.336
<i>I'm getting out of</i>

14:42.404 --> 14:43.270
<i>Khloe's house.</i>

14:43.338 --> 14:44.037
<i>I don't want some</i>

14:44.105 --> 14:46.739
<i>negative person in our home.</i>

14:46.939 --> 14:50.439
-- Sync by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> --

14:51.141 --> 14:53.075
<i>Hi! How are you?!</i>

14:53.143 --> 14:54.642
<i>So good to see you.</i>

14:54.710 --> 14:56.278
<i>You look gorgeous.</i>

14:56.346 --> 14:57.613
<i>So do you.</i>

14:57.616 --> 15:00.018
<i>My girls are here.</i>

15:05.189 --> 15:06.223
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

15:06.290 --> 15:07.857
<i>I didn't do it!</i>

15:13.929 --> 15:14.561
<i>Is this your beer?</i>

15:14.629 --> 15:15.763
<i>No.</i>

15:15.830 --> 15:16.964
<i>Crumbs, crumbs, crumbs.</i>

15:17.031 --> 15:18.932
<i>There's red wine here.</i>

15:19.000 --> 15:21.101
<i>Stop. Stop!</i>

15:21.169 --> 15:23.103
<i>Merry maid Kim is like turning</i>

15:23.171 --> 15:24.538
<i>into a lunatic.</i>

15:24.606 --> 15:25.572
<i>I didn't want to have</i>

15:25.640 --> 15:26.573
<i>this party, so you need to help</i>

15:26.641 --> 15:27.340
<i>me clean up.</i>

15:27.408 --> 15:28.575
<i>This was your bright idea.</i>

15:28.642 --> 15:29.542
<i>It's embarrassing.</i>

15:30.410 --> 15:31.177
<i>Man 1: I'm already getting</i>

15:31.244 --> 15:31.811
<i>drunk.</i>

15:31.878 --> 15:33.178
<i>Man 2: I know, man.</i>

15:33.246 --> 15:34.179
<i>Kim.</i>

15:34.247 --> 15:35.080
<i>What?</i>

15:35.148 --> 15:36.014
<i>Rob, all of his friends</i>

15:36.082 --> 15:36.915
<i>have shown up...</i>

15:36.982 --> 15:37.582
<i>And he's not here.</i>

15:37.650 --> 15:38.550
<i>He is at the</i>

15:38.618 --> 15:39.050
<i>laker game.</i>

15:39.118 --> 15:39.651
<i>Kick all of his</i>

15:39.719 --> 15:41.586
<i>friends out.</i>

15:41.654 --> 15:43.055
<i>I am so upset with my mom</i>

15:43.122 --> 15:44.122
<i>right now.</i>

15:44.190 --> 15:45.123
<i>This is exactly what I said</i>

15:45.191 --> 15:46.558
<i>i didn't want.</i>

15:46.625 --> 15:47.792
<i>What's going on here?</i>

15:47.860 --> 15:48.560
<i>Jesse drafted you to</i>

15:48.628 --> 15:49.494
<i>our team.</i>

15:49.562 --> 15:50.561
<i>All you have to do is throw that</i>

15:50.629 --> 15:52.595
<i>ball into any cup you want.</i>

15:52.663 --> 15:53.996
<i>Okay.</i>

15:55.966 --> 15:57.032
<i>Sorry, fellas!</i>

15:57.100 --> 15:59.033
<i>Here we go!</i>

16:03.603 --> 16:04.536
<i>I'm cleaning up, and I</i>

16:04.604 --> 16:08.438
<i>notice this huge</i> red wine stain

16:08.506 --> 16:10.139
on my couch pillow.

16:10.207 --> 16:11.540
I cannot handle this anymore.

16:11.608 --> 16:13.175
I want everyone to go.

16:13.243 --> 16:14.276
I'm just gonna lock myself in my

16:14.344 --> 16:16.779
room because this is just too

16:16.847 --> 16:19.947
much anxiety for me.

16:23.217 --> 16:24.346
Kim?

16:24.414 --> 16:25.517
Yeah?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.352
What are you doing?

16:27.453 --> 16:29.520
Trying to clean up.

16:29.587 --> 16:30.554
But the party's still

16:30.621 --> 16:31.521
going on.

16:31.589 --> 16:32.989
I know, but my pillow's

16:33.057 --> 16:34.757
ruined.

16:34.824 --> 16:35.791
All right,

16:35.858 --> 16:38.528
come here.

16:38.595 --> 16:39.796
What?

16:39.864 --> 16:41.097
Have a seat.

16:41.165 --> 16:42.366
I've been watching you.

16:42.433 --> 16:43.300
You're not enjoying yourself

16:43.368 --> 16:44.234
one bit.

16:44.302 --> 16:45.102
No, and I'm not going

16:45.169 --> 16:46.035
down there anymore.

16:46.103 --> 16:47.303
The party's over.

16:47.371 --> 16:48.104
The party is actually

16:48.172 --> 16:49.005
just getting started.

16:49.073 --> 16:50.574
No, for me, it's over.

16:50.642 --> 16:51.542
This is my dream home.

16:51.610 --> 16:52.778
Everything about this house is

16:52.845 --> 16:53.879
brand-new.

16:53.947 --> 16:55.549
It's exactly what I wanted.

16:55.616 --> 16:56.483
It's perfect.

16:56.551 --> 16:57.685
And if anyone was gonna

16:57.753 --> 16:59.354
mess it up, it has to be me.

16:59.422 --> 17:00.522
I...

17:00.590 --> 17:02.024
I understand.

17:02.091 --> 17:02.891
You know, you built

17:02.959 --> 17:04.092
a great house.

17:04.160 --> 17:05.426
You gotta kind of break it in.

17:05.493 --> 17:06.828
A house is to enjoy.

17:06.896 --> 17:08.029
It's about building memories,

17:08.097 --> 17:09.431
having a good time.

17:09.499 --> 17:10.898
It's just my house, and

17:10.967 --> 17:13.401
how I live is under my control.

17:13.469 --> 17:14.736
So when it gets out of order,

17:14.804 --> 17:17.105
I feel like not myself.

17:17.173 --> 17:17.906
You just have to

17:17.973 --> 17:18.772
remember that anything that

17:18.840 --> 17:21.276
happens, we can fix, you know?

17:21.343 --> 17:22.242
The pillow, you know, we can get

17:22.310 --> 17:23.278
another pillow.

17:23.345 --> 17:24.311
Pillows are easy, but you can't

17:24.380 --> 17:26.446
get other, you know, memories.

17:26.515 --> 17:28.316
It's to live in, you know?

17:28.384 --> 17:29.517
Yeah, you're right.

17:29.585 --> 17:30.518
The only person I'm

17:30.586 --> 17:33.354
concerned about is your mom.

17:33.422 --> 17:34.388
She's probably down there right

17:34.456 --> 17:36.990
now ruining this place.

17:37.058 --> 17:38.125
I need to go get her.

17:38.192 --> 17:39.125
Yeah, let's go

17:39.193 --> 17:40.093
get her.

17:40.161 --> 17:40.927
Yeah!

17:40.995 --> 17:43.463
Whoo!

17:43.530 --> 17:45.031
Okay, I'm going inside.

17:45.099 --> 17:46.632
Love you guys.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.838
I am so proud of you showing off

17:52.906 --> 17:54.874
your little cupcake,

17:54.941 --> 17:56.041
and I think...

18:02.246 --> 18:03.113
Kim...

18:03.180 --> 18:05.915
No! Mommy, no!

18:05.983 --> 18:07.817
Really? Really?

18:07.885 --> 18:09.518
You don't want to mess with

18:09.586 --> 18:11.419
me, bitch!

18:15.122 --> 18:16.255
Are people welcome to

18:16.323 --> 18:18.023
your new house, Kim?!

18:23.227 --> 18:24.695
Everybody, grab a

18:24.763 --> 18:26.530
broom.

18:26.598 --> 18:27.998
Everyone, I'm gonna get

18:28.066 --> 18:29.533
in the shower, so enjoy

18:29.600 --> 18:30.734
yourselves!

18:30.801 --> 18:31.768
I wanted to thank you all

18:31.835 --> 18:33.002
for coming.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.203
You're all welcome to come any

18:34.270 --> 18:35.370
time you want.

18:38.574 --> 18:39.507
Just don't spill

18:39.575 --> 18:40.542
anything else.

18:40.609 --> 18:43.310
The cleaning crew's coming.

19:01.187 --> 19:02.554
Come in.

19:02.622 --> 19:03.555
Kourt?

19:03.623 --> 19:04.556
Yeah?

19:04.623 --> 19:05.523
What are you doing?

19:05.591 --> 19:06.457
Just finishing

19:06.525 --> 19:07.525
packing.

19:07.592 --> 19:08.859
Where are you going?

19:08.927 --> 19:09.793
To Kim's.

19:09.861 --> 19:10.561
Why?

19:10.628 --> 19:12.763
Because I don't

19:12.830 --> 19:15.098
feel like having this negative

19:15.166 --> 19:16.933
energy in my life right now.

19:17.001 --> 19:18.501
Oh, come on, Kourtney.

19:18.569 --> 19:19.435
I'm getting out of

19:19.503 --> 19:20.403
Khloe's house.

19:20.470 --> 19:21.804
This isn't the best environment

19:21.872 --> 19:23.105
for Mason and I.

19:23.172 --> 19:24.572
So I think that Mason and I

19:24.640 --> 19:25.940
living with Kim is the best

19:26.008 --> 19:27.576
thing for everyone.

19:27.643 --> 19:28.410
What am I supposed to

19:28.477 --> 19:29.744
do if I don't want some negative

19:29.812 --> 19:31.379
person in our home?

19:31.447 --> 19:32.246
That's not what

19:32.314 --> 19:33.114
it's about.

19:33.182 --> 19:36.016
If he needs to see his son, and

19:36.084 --> 19:37.551
he can't drive in the driveway

19:37.619 --> 19:40.287
to make it easier for me to get

19:40.354 --> 19:42.455
my stuff in the car, I don't

19:42.523 --> 19:43.923
need the little backhanded

19:43.991 --> 19:46.325
comments every second in my ear.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.527
I've tried to manage the

19:48.595 --> 19:50.095
situation with Khloe and Scott

19:50.163 --> 19:52.264
not getting along, but right

19:52.332 --> 19:55.133
now I think I just need to keep

19:55.201 --> 19:56.401
them two separate parts

19:56.468 --> 19:57.502
in my life.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.403
As hard as that is, I know that

19:59.471 --> 20:01.471
it's a lot easier than living

20:01.539 --> 20:02.538
with Khloe and trying to

20:02.606 --> 20:03.540
manage it.

20:03.607 --> 20:05.074
Bottom line is, I

20:05.142 --> 20:06.376
don't want this interfering with

20:06.443 --> 20:07.544
our relationship.

20:07.611 --> 20:08.544
I feel like lately our

20:08.612 --> 20:09.946
relationship has not been what

20:10.013 --> 20:12.514
it is because of Scott, and you

20:12.582 --> 20:13.715
know if this is gonna save our

20:13.783 --> 20:15.183
relationship, then great.

20:15.251 --> 20:15.951
And I'm married.

20:16.018 --> 20:17.285
I don't need all of my brothers

20:17.353 --> 20:18.520
and sisters living in my house

20:18.588 --> 20:20.088
with my husband.

20:20.155 --> 20:20.855
And I'm 31 years

20:20.923 --> 20:21.355
old.

20:21.423 --> 20:22.456
I don't need to be living

20:22.524 --> 20:23.324
somewhere that I have rules.

20:23.391 --> 20:24.358
You know, I could try it out

20:24.425 --> 20:26.526
at Kim's and see how it goes.

20:26.594 --> 20:27.794
Khloe well, do

20:27.862 --> 20:29.062
you need any help packing?

20:29.130 --> 20:30.564
I'm not trying to rush you out,

20:30.631 --> 20:32.432
but you know, if you need help,

20:32.499 --> 20:33.566
I'm here to help.

20:33.634 --> 20:35.368
I definitely hate to see Mason

20:35.436 --> 20:36.569
and Kourtney go.

20:36.637 --> 20:38.104
Let's sleep together tonight.

20:38.171 --> 20:39.038
We're sisters.

20:39.106 --> 20:40.139
I love her with all my heart,

20:40.207 --> 20:41.240
but you know, if this is gonna

20:41.308 --> 20:42.541
make our relationship better,

20:42.609 --> 20:45.143
then maybe that's the best.

20:45.211 --> 20:46.378
Kourtney!

20:46.445 --> 20:49.280
Khloe...

20:59.585 --> 21:02.219
I say we load up the <i>béb?</i>

21:02.287 --> 21:03.887
<i>I'll bring this and this.</i>

21:03.955 --> 21:04.854
<i>We could make a second</i>

21:04.922 --> 21:06.055
<i>trip if need be.</i>

21:06.123 --> 21:06.856
<i>I think we got</i>

21:06.923 --> 21:07.523
<i>it all.</i>

21:07.590 --> 21:08.724
<i>Do you have a bellman?</i>

21:08.791 --> 21:09.724
<i>Yeah, Robert's the new</i>

21:09.792 --> 21:11.592
<i>and improved Bruce.</i>

21:14.594 --> 21:16.361
<i>Mason? Mason?</i>

21:16.429 --> 21:17.495
<i>Mason, one day, kid,</i>

21:17.563 --> 21:18.496
<i>you're gonna be doing this</i>

21:18.564 --> 21:20.164
<i>dance.</i>

21:20.231 --> 21:21.431
<i>Kourtney and I at this point in</i>

21:21.499 --> 21:22.499
<i>our lives aren't gonna ever see</i>

21:22.567 --> 21:24.167
<i>e-to-eye on this suation.</i>

21:24.234 --> 21:25.734
<i>Call me when you get to Kim's.</i>

21:25.802 --> 21:26.535
<i>Okay.</i>

21:26.603 --> 21:27.469
<i>I just get frustrated</i>

21:27.570 --> 21:28.369
<i>'cause I feel like everything</i>

21:28.437 --> 21:29.804
<i>kind of turns back to Scott.</i>

21:29.872 --> 21:32.139
<i>And it's hard and it's sad,</i>

21:32.206 --> 21:33.807
<i>especially if she's hang so</i>

21:33.875 --> 21:35.375
<i>many problems with Scott.</i>

21:35.442 --> 21:36.375
<i>Like why is she still letting</i>

21:36.442 --> 21:37.943
<i>him drive a wedge between us,</i>

21:38.011 --> 21:38.877
<i>too?</i>

21:38.944 --> 21:39.710
<i>Bye.</i>

21:39.778 --> 21:41.613
<i>Bye, kourt, love ya.</i>

21:49.220 --> 21:49.953

21:51.821 --> 21:52.921

21:52.989 --> 21:53.921
<i>I've already talked to</i>

21:53.989 --> 21:55.556

<i>Do you get any extra tickets</i>
