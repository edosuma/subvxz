( laser buzzing )

00:09.291 --> 00:13.375
GREENE:

00:09.291 --> 00:13.375
I call them

00:09.291 --> 00:13.375
my laser sliced-cubes.

00:13.417 --> 00:16.333
Perfectly symmetrical

00:13.417 --> 00:16.333
every time.

00:16.375 --> 00:18.875
And how are my two favorite

00:16.375 --> 00:18.875
ladies getting along?

00:18.917 --> 00:22.792
Frankie, have you told Anna

00:18.917 --> 00:22.792
about your school report,

00:22.834 --> 00:24.750
on the pre-larval

00:22.834 --> 00:24.750
stages of cicadas?

00:24.792 --> 00:27.667
Dad, not even Cody

00:24.792 --> 00:27.667
wants to hear about that.

00:27.709 --> 00:30.834
Actually, Francine, I studied

00:27.709 --> 00:30.834
entomology, so I'm very--

00:30.875 --> 00:34.792
Yes! See? You two have

00:30.875 --> 00:34.792
insect eggs in common!

00:34.834 --> 00:36.333
As well as, uh,

00:36.375 --> 00:37.875
chocolate milk!

00:37.917 --> 00:39.667
Anna loves it too,

00:37.917 --> 00:39.667
Frankie.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.792
Ezra, are you

00:41.208 --> 00:43.792
feeling well?

00:43.834 --> 00:46.875
Never better.

00:43.834 --> 00:46.875
Oh. The sandwiches.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.083
I completely forgot them.

00:46.917 --> 00:50.083
I'll be right back.

00:51.750 --> 00:53.333
HEATWAVE:

00:51.750 --> 00:53.333
Psst. Doc.

00:53.375 --> 00:56.125
I still don't get

00:53.375 --> 00:56.125
what you need me here for.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.208
Unless you're gonna set fire

00:56.166 --> 00:58.208
to those sandwiches.

01:00.041 --> 01:02.458
GREENE:

01:00.041 --> 01:02.458
Oh, look at that!

01:02.500 --> 01:05.208
I forgot my special

01:02.500 --> 01:05.208
recipe mustard.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.417
Can't have a proper sandwich

01:05.250 --> 01:07.417
without it.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.250
Be right back. Bye!

01:09.291 --> 01:11.750
Ezra!

01:09.291 --> 01:11.750
Daddy?

01:15.041 --> 01:19.041
I had no idea your father

01:15.041 --> 01:19.041
loved mustard so much.

01:19.083 --> 01:21.208
He doesn't, he just...

01:21.250 --> 01:23.458
Wants us to be friends.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.792
How am I doing?

01:23.500 --> 01:25.792
Um...good.

01:25.834 --> 01:29.583
You know, Francine,

01:25.834 --> 01:29.583
I really did study cicadas,

01:29.625 --> 01:31.125
so I'd be happy to--

01:31.166 --> 01:34.041
MAN ( over radio ):

01:31.166 --> 01:34.041
Mayday! Mayday!

01:34.083 --> 01:35.792
Sinking fast!

01:35.834 --> 01:37.500
Who is this?

01:35.834 --> 01:37.500
Where are you?

01:37.542 --> 01:40.291
Hello?! Hello? Hel--

01:37.542 --> 01:40.291
( static buzzing )

01:40.333 --> 01:42.458
I can't get

01:40.333 --> 01:42.458
their signal back.

01:42.500 --> 01:45.625
Frankie, can you reach

01:42.500 --> 01:45.625
the Rescue Team?

01:45.667 --> 01:47.333
Ugh!

01:45.667 --> 01:47.333
I can't reach anyone!

01:47.375 --> 01:49.208
Something's interfering

01:47.375 --> 01:49.208
with my holo-com!

01:49.250 --> 01:51.583
Then we'll just have

01:49.250 --> 01:51.583
to save them ourselves.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.583
The signal says

01:57.208 --> 01:59.583
it should be right here.

02:02.291 --> 02:05.750
Frankie, please stay

02:02.291 --> 02:05.750
in the cabin and out of sight.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.375
Why? There's nothing here.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.375
Exactly.

02:08.417 --> 02:11.291
No ship, an empty dock,

02:08.417 --> 02:11.291
a mysterious SOS.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.959
Until we know

02:11.333 --> 02:12.959
what's going on,

02:13.000 --> 02:15.417
I want to make sure

02:13.000 --> 02:15.417
you're safe.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.333
Hello! Anyone?

02:19.375 --> 02:20.959

answering a distress signal

03:15.166 --> 03:17.709
of a sinking ship.

03:15.166 --> 03:17.709
Stand aside.

03:17.750 --> 03:20.417
There is no sinking vessel.

03:20.458 --> 03:24.083
Just a trap I laid

03:20.458 --> 03:24.083
for someone other than you.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.041
And as for standing aside...

03:26.083 --> 03:27.458
( chuckles )

03:27.500 --> 03:29.625
Quint Quarry doesn't do that.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.291
Now where is Dr. Greene?

03:32.333 --> 03:36.250
I am the only person

03:32.333 --> 03:36.250
aboard this ship.

03:36.291 --> 03:38.959
Pardon me if I don't

03:36.291 --> 03:38.959
take your word for it.

03:39.000 --> 03:42.208
Q-drone, search the vessel!

03:42.250 --> 03:45.542
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

03:57.000 --> 03:59.917
Well, it appears you've

03:57.000 --> 03:59.917
missed your quarry, Quarry.

03:59.959 --> 04:02.500
Now, if we're finished here,

03:59.959 --> 04:02.500
I'll be on my way.

04:02.542 --> 04:04.375
Ah, not quite yet.

04:04.417 --> 04:07.542
Just means a slight change

04:04.417 --> 04:07.542
in plans. Drones!

04:07.583 --> 04:11.041
Our new guest

04:07.583 --> 04:11.041
needs a place to stay.

04:11.083 --> 04:14.083
You have no right!

04:11.083 --> 04:14.083
Let me go!

04:18.875 --> 04:22.000
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

04:25.041 --> 04:28.041
Hope you're on your way back

04:25.041 --> 04:28.041
with that mustard, Dad.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.542
Because we're in a

04:28.083 --> 04:29.542
pretty big pickle.

04:32.208 --> 04:35.542
GREENE:

04:32.208 --> 04:35.542
I want Anna and Frankie's first

04:32.208 --> 04:35.542
picnic together to be perfect.

04:35.583 --> 04:38.792
And you can't have a perfect

04:35.583 --> 04:38.792
picnic without...

04:45.750 --> 04:47.959
( bell dings )

04:48.000 --> 04:51.041
...the perfect mustard!

04:51.083 --> 04:53.000
Bravo, doc!

04:53.041 --> 04:55.375
Oh, yeah. That was an

04:53.041 --> 04:55.375
efficient use of our time.

04:55.417 --> 04:58.166
Wait, I thought mustard

04:55.417 --> 04:58.166
was the red stuff.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.041
No, Blades.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.041
That's ketchup.

05:00.083 --> 05:02.917
I am told humans

05:00.083 --> 05:02.917
put it on hot dogs.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.875
Presumably to cool

05:02.959 --> 05:04.875
the animals off.

05:04.917 --> 05:07.792
Now, I'd better get back

05:04.917 --> 05:07.792
before my picnic lunch

05:07.834 --> 05:10.041
turns into a picnic dinner.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.709
Oh! What in the world?!

05:12.750 --> 05:14.667
G'day, Dr. Greene.

05:14.709 --> 05:17.917
I'm a great admirer

05:14.709 --> 05:17.917
of your work.

05:17.959 --> 05:22.542
And look! It's the little

05:17.959 --> 05:22.542
feisty one. Heh-heh.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.250
He can see us?

05:26.625 --> 05:29.083
Have we met, Mr...?

05:29.125 --> 05:31.083
Colonel Quint Quarry.

05:31.125 --> 05:34.208
And I think you already

05:31.125 --> 05:34.208
know my new house guest.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.375
Anna! Where are you?

05:36.417 --> 05:39.083
And where is Fr--

05:36.417 --> 05:39.083
ANNA:  The floating lab?

05:39.125 --> 05:41.000
Sorry, Ezra,

05:41.041 --> 05:44.333
I know I'm not supposed

05:41.041 --> 05:44.333
to take it out by myself.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.417
And now this Quarry person

05:44.375 --> 05:46.417
won't let me leave.

05:46.458 --> 05:50.208
I guarantee you,

05:46.458 --> 05:50.208
once I have what I want,

05:50.250 --> 05:53.291
the professor will be

05:50.250 --> 05:53.291
returned to you safely.

05:53.333 --> 05:55.709
And what exactly

05:53.333 --> 05:55.709
do you want?

05:55.750 --> 05:57.542
A small favor, really.

05:57.583 --> 06:00.875
A while ago I made

05:57.583 --> 06:00.875
the mistake of borrowing

06:00.917 --> 06:03.500
one of your robot dinosaurs

06:03.542 --> 06:07.417
for my very specialized

06:03.542 --> 06:07.417
hunting enterprise, you see.

06:07.458 --> 06:11.333
Then it,

06:07.458 --> 06:11.333
and your other creation,

06:11.375 --> 06:13.500
destroyed half my island

06:13.542 --> 06:15.542
and all of my business.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.542
My creation?

06:17.583 --> 06:19.709
Uh, but colonel, I had

06:17.583 --> 06:19.709
nothing to do with them.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.083
There's clearly been

06:19.750 --> 06:22.083
a misunderstanding.

06:22.125 --> 06:24.375
Right, Dr. Greene.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.542
I'm sure there are

06:24.417 --> 06:26.542
lots of other

06:26.583 --> 06:30.208
Griffin Rock scientists

06:26.583 --> 06:30.208
building robotic reptilians.

06:30.250 --> 06:34.208
Are those giant bots

06:30.250 --> 06:34.208
your work too, I presume?

06:34.250 --> 06:37.041
Unless they just

06:34.250 --> 06:37.041
fell out of the sky?

06:37.083 --> 06:39.291
Well, I, um--

06:37.083 --> 06:39.291
No, no.

06:39.333 --> 06:41.959
You're responsible

06:39.333 --> 06:41.959
for the damage

06:42.000 --> 06:43.959
those Dino-Bots caused.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.583
And you're going to repay me

06:46.625 --> 06:48.750
by building more of 'em.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.041
The two that destroyed

06:48.792 --> 06:51.041
my old island,

06:51.083 --> 06:52.917
plus three more.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.166
A fist of Dino-Bots

06:55.208 --> 06:56.875
will help me rebuild

06:55.208 --> 06:56.875
my business.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.000
Once I have them, your

06:56.917 --> 07:00.000
colleague will be returned.

07:00.041 --> 07:04.375
I'll send my heli-jet to

07:00.041 --> 07:04.375
pick up my order in 12 hours.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.750
You will come alone.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.625
At least we know

07:09.375 --> 07:12.625
Professor Baranova's safe.

07:12.667 --> 07:15.750
Quarry won't risk hurting her

07:12.667 --> 07:15.750
until he has what he wants.

07:15.792 --> 07:19.625
But I can't give it to him.

07:15.792 --> 07:19.625
And what about Frankie?

07:19.667 --> 07:22.875
The professor cleverly let us

07:19.667 --> 07:22.875
know that Francine is safe.

07:22.917 --> 07:25.667
It sounds like Quarry doesn't

07:22.917 --> 07:25.667
even know she's there.

07:25.709 --> 07:30.166
We started this, doc.

07:25.709 --> 07:30.166
We're going to make it right.

07:30.208 --> 07:33.500
I say we storm his island!

07:30.208 --> 07:33.500
He won't even see us coming.

07:33.542 --> 07:35.834
Kade, we don't even

07:33.542 --> 07:35.834
know where it is.

07:35.875 --> 07:38.959
There's nothing on any map

07:35.875 --> 07:38.959
near the lab's last location.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.667
And I couldn't find

07:39.000 --> 07:41.667
anything in the database.

07:41.709 --> 07:44.709
So the only way to get

07:41.709 --> 07:44.709
Anna and Frankie back

07:44.750 --> 07:48.166
is to give Quarry Dino-Bots

07:44.750 --> 07:48.166
that I don't have.

07:48.208 --> 07:50.000
OPTIMUS:

07:48.208 --> 07:50.000
Excuse me, doctor.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.417
Dino-Bots

07:50.041 --> 07:53.417
you don't have...yet.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.709
When I heard this was

07:53.458 --> 07:55.709
about Dino- Bots,

07:55.750 --> 07:58.083
I took the liberty

07:55.750 --> 07:58.083
of calling the original.

07:58.125 --> 07:59.917
From what

07:58.125 --> 07:59.917
the chief has told me,

07:59.959 --> 08:01.834
it appears

07:59.959 --> 08:01.834
the best course of action

08:01.875 --> 08:03.625
is to offer myself

08:01.875 --> 08:03.625
and Boulder,

08:03.667 --> 08:06.208
in our dino forms,

08:03.667 --> 08:06.208
to Quarry.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.458
Once we're there,

08:06.250 --> 08:09.458
we can rescue the others.

08:09.500 --> 08:11.667
But Quarry's expecting

08:09.500 --> 08:11.667
five Dino-Bots.

08:11.709 --> 08:13.125
We still need three more.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.083
I can scan

08:13.166 --> 08:15.083
a dino form too.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.333
Why should you guys

08:15.125 --> 08:17.333
have all the fun?

08:17.375 --> 08:19.834
Heh-heh. Chase?

08:17.375 --> 08:19.834
It would be a violation

08:19.875 --> 08:21.917
of the Rescue Bot oath

08:19.875 --> 08:21.917
not to join you.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.792
Um, well...

08:23.834 --> 08:27.375
Blades, we know

08:23.834 --> 08:27.375
your bravery is boundless,

08:27.417 --> 08:30.875
but the choice to help

08:27.417 --> 08:30.875
is always yours.

08:30.917 --> 08:33.792
Although it is something

08:30.917 --> 08:33.792
Bumblebee would do.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.500
Oh, all right,

08:33.834 --> 08:36.500
I'll do it!

08:36.542 --> 08:38.667
But this time,

08:36.542 --> 08:38.667
I don't want to be--

08:38.709 --> 08:43.500
A flying thing?!

08:38.709 --> 08:43.500
Come on! Again?!

08:44.875 --> 08:47.083
Energon patches ready,

08:44.875 --> 08:47.083
Optimus.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.500
DANI:

08:47.125 --> 08:48.500
One for each of you.

08:48.542 --> 08:50.875
KADE:

08:48.542 --> 08:50.875
No dino rampages this time.

08:50.917 --> 08:54.709
Excellent. As long as our

08:50.917 --> 08:54.709
Energon levels remain stable,

08:54.750 --> 08:57.291
we can control

08:54.750 --> 08:57.291
our dino modes.

08:57.333 --> 09:00.208
Boulder, have you

08:57.333 --> 09:00.208
prepared your colleagues

09:00.250 --> 09:02.333
for taking on a new form?

09:04.291 --> 09:05.834
Ready as we'll ever be.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.792
Rescue Bots,

09:07.834 --> 09:10.041
scan and transform!

09:10.083 --> 09:13.542
(  majestic theme playing  )

09:21.041 --> 09:24.625
Whoa! This guy and I were

09:21.041 --> 09:24.625
practically made for each other.

09:30.625 --> 09:34.542
Oh! An odd but not entirely

09:30.625 --> 09:34.542
unpleasant sensation.

09:36.291 --> 09:38.041
And that could come in handy.

09:41.250 --> 09:44.000
Ha-ha! Didn't get to try

09:41.250 --> 09:44.000
that last time.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.625
Works pretty well!

09:45.667 --> 09:47.875
( groans )

09:51.959 --> 09:53.458
( groaning )

09:53.500 --> 09:57.166
Ah! I can't transform!

09:57.208 --> 09:59.792
OPTIMUS:

09:57.208 --> 09:59.792
Remain calm, Blades.

09:59.834 --> 10:02.208
Can you assume

09:59.834 --> 10:02.208
helicopter mode?

10:02.250 --> 10:04.834
( grunting )

10:04.875 --> 10:07.625
My T-Cog. Something must

10:04.875 --> 10:07.625
have happened to it.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.709
I-I can't transform at all!

10:09.750 --> 10:13.417
Taking new forms,

10:09.750 --> 10:13.417
especially bio-organic ones,

10:13.458 --> 10:16.208
can affect your

10:13.458 --> 10:16.208
transformation abilities.

10:16.250 --> 10:19.875
With rest and time, your T-Cog

10:16.250 --> 10:19.875
should return to normal.

10:19.917 --> 10:21.750
BURNS:

10:19.917 --> 10:21.750
Quarry will be

10:19.917 --> 10:21.750
arriving any minute.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.166
We'd better get out

10:21.792 --> 10:24.166
to the loading dock.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.375
It's no good.

10:27.417 --> 10:30.000
I definitely won't need this.

10:30.041 --> 10:31.667
I'll never transform again.

10:31.709 --> 10:33.792
And I've ruined the plan.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.291
Maybe something

10:33.834 --> 10:35.291
just came loose.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.250
Want me to check

10:35.333 --> 10:37.250
under your dash?

10:37.291 --> 10:39.208
Just tell me if you see

10:37.291 --> 10:39.208
green spots.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.917
Oh, or red ones.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.917
But not blue.

10:41.959 --> 10:45.417
If you see blue spots,

10:41.959 --> 10:45.417
I don't even want to know.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.959
( helicopter whirring )

10:50.875 --> 10:53.583
We need to get out of sight.

10:50.875 --> 10:53.583
Good luck, doc.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.250
You'll have to make some

10:53.625 --> 10:56.250
excuse about the fifth dino.

10:56.291 --> 10:59.917
Optimus, I'm sure you'll bring

10:56.291 --> 10:59.917
everyone back safe and sound.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.125
You have my word.

11:03.625 --> 11:06.000
Blades, hide!

11:08.875 --> 11:10.417
HEATWAVE: Quarry's here!

11:08.875 --> 11:10.417
Ah!

11:10.458 --> 11:11.917
Who turned out

11:10.458 --> 11:11.917
the lights?

11:11.959 --> 11:13.333
Stand still.

11:13.375 --> 11:15.709
And try to look more

11:13.375 --> 11:15.709
ptero-whatever-ish.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.000
BLADES:

11:15.750 --> 11:18.000
But Heatwave--

11:18.041 --> 11:20.750
It's too late! I can't

11:18.041 --> 11:20.750
get out without being seen.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.000
Don't worry.

11:20.792 --> 11:23.000
I'll climb out after they leave.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.583
Quarry, where is

11:29.667 --> 11:31.583
Professor Baranova?

11:31.625 --> 11:33.792
You promised you'd

11:31.625 --> 11:33.792
bring her and my da--

11:33.834 --> 11:35.625
My lab back.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.792
And you promised me

11:35.667 --> 11:37.792
five Dino-Bots.

11:37.834 --> 11:39.375
What's wrong with this one?

11:39.417 --> 11:42.166
It's, uh, unfinished,

11:42.208 --> 11:44.792
but nearly complete,

11:42.208 --> 11:44.792
I promise.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.667
Do you now? Good.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.375
You're coming along,

11:46.709 --> 11:48.375
Dr. Greene.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.291
You can finish it

11:48.417 --> 11:50.291
on my island.

11:50.333 --> 11:52.291
Once you're done,

11:50.333 --> 11:52.291
I'll return your colleague

11:52.333 --> 11:54.125
and your floating lab.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.375
Q-Drones,

11:54.166 --> 11:57.375
prepare for take-off!

12:02.875 --> 12:05.166
Or I could go along.

12:08.291 --> 12:11.333
BURNS:

12:08.291 --> 12:11.333
We'd better get back

12:08.291 --> 12:11.333
to the firehouse.

12:14.417 --> 12:16.458
Cody, I want you to--

12:14.417 --> 12:16.458
Where's Cody?

12:16.500 --> 12:17.959
Wasn't he with you?

12:18.000 --> 12:19.667
He climbed into Blades

12:18.000 --> 12:19.667
for a minute,

12:19.709 --> 12:22.458
but I thought he-- Oh, no!

12:19.709 --> 12:22.458
Cody!

12:26.750 --> 12:30.000
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:37.417 --> 12:40.375
Dr. Greene, in the flesh.

12:40.417 --> 12:44.041
Where is Professor Baranova

12:40.417 --> 12:44.041
and where is my lab?

12:44.083 --> 12:48.917
You can see her after

12:44.083 --> 12:48.917
I test my merchandise.

12:48.959 --> 12:52.750
My clients don't appreciate

12:48.959 --> 12:52.750
defective products.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.166
You're going to sell them?

12:55.208 --> 12:58.583
And rebuild my big game

12:55.208 --> 12:58.583
business off the profits.

12:58.625 --> 13:01.667
Drones, bring

12:58.625 --> 13:01.667
the finished dinos.

13:01.709 --> 13:05.834
And I advise you to complete

13:01.709 --> 13:05.834
the last one ASAP.

13:05.875 --> 13:09.917
But I have no tools,

13:05.875 --> 13:09.917
or supplies.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.875
Ah, use whatever

13:09.959 --> 13:11.875
you can find in there.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.208
But no funny business.

13:17.417 --> 13:19.500
Optimus, why not

13:17.417 --> 13:19.500
just take him?

13:19.542 --> 13:20.834
Not yet.

13:20.875 --> 13:22.583
If we move too soon,

13:22.625 --> 13:25.041
we may place the others

13:22.625 --> 13:25.041
in danger.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.333
Now what?

13:26.375 --> 13:28.083
I don't have

13:26.375 --> 13:28.083
another Dino-Bot.

13:28.125 --> 13:30.917
And Frankie and Anna

13:28.125 --> 13:30.917
could be anywhere.

13:30.959 --> 13:33.750
Um, not to add

13:30.959 --> 13:33.750
to your burden,

13:33.792 --> 13:36.834
but we may have

13:33.792 --> 13:36.834
one more tiny problem.

13:36.875 --> 13:39.583
Cody!

13:36.875 --> 13:39.583
What are you doing here?

13:39.625 --> 13:41.583
Uh, long story, doc.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.208
Your com-link!

13:43.250 --> 13:44.917
We could contact

13:43.250 --> 13:44.917
Frankie, and--

13:44.959 --> 13:47.583
I already tried it

13:44.959 --> 13:47.583
as soon as we landed.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.917
But Quarry must be

13:47.625 --> 13:49.917
jamming communication.

13:49.959 --> 13:52.291
Where do we even

13:49.959 --> 13:52.291
start looking?

13:52.333 --> 13:55.542
If we had some sort of

13:52.333 --> 13:55.542
heat-seeking device...

13:55.583 --> 13:59.750
Quarry said you could use

13:55.583 --> 13:59.750
any equipment in the hangar.

14:02.250 --> 14:05.959
QUARRY:

14:02.250 --> 14:05.959
Oh, yeah, that's it.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.083
Keep those bids coming!

14:08.125 --> 14:11.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:16.500 --> 14:18.333
( roars )

14:18.375 --> 14:20.583
( chuckling )

14:23.166 --> 14:26.125
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

14:26.166 --> 14:27.750
( leaves rustling )

14:36.709 --> 14:38.125
( Frankie grunts )

14:38.166 --> 14:40.625
Francine!

14:38.166 --> 14:40.625
What are you doing here?!

14:40.667 --> 14:44.166
Ta-da! I'll lower the hose

14:40.667 --> 14:44.166
and you climb up it.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.250
Easy peasy!

14:44.208 --> 14:46.250
Francine, wait!

14:46.291 --> 14:49.291
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

14:49.333 --> 14:51.125
( gasps )

14:52.458 --> 14:55.959
So... Not very good

14:52.458 --> 14:55.959
at waiting, are we?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.959
No.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.875
GRAHAM:

14:58.000 --> 15:01.875
Cody's Com-Tab stopped

14:58.000 --> 15:01.875
responding right about here.

15:01.917 --> 15:05.250
So if I project the Com-Tab's

15:01.917 --> 15:05.250
trajectory forward

15:05.291 --> 15:08.250
and factor in how far most

15:05.291 --> 15:08.250
jamming signals can spread,

15:08.291 --> 15:12.709
Quarry's Island should be

15:08.291 --> 15:12.709
somewhere near...here.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.333
Let's go get him!

15:14.375 --> 15:15.667
ANNA:

15:14.375 --> 15:15.667
There.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.917
I'd already disabled

15:15.709 --> 15:17.917
the external alarm,

15:17.959 --> 15:21.667
so fortunately your rescue

15:17.959 --> 15:21.667
didn't draw more attention.

15:21.709 --> 15:23.792
I'm sorry, professor.

15:23.834 --> 15:26.083
I just wanted to show you

15:26.125 --> 15:28.750
I'm not some kid

15:26.125 --> 15:28.750
you have to take care of.

15:28.792 --> 15:31.500
I don't think of you

15:28.792 --> 15:31.500
that way at all, Francine.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.625
You're an amazing young woman.

15:33.667 --> 15:37.750
It's just, after living alone

15:33.667 --> 15:37.750
under the sea for 28 years,

15:37.792 --> 15:41.083
I'm not sure I'm very good

15:37.792 --> 15:41.083
at being a team player.

15:41.125 --> 15:44.667
Me either. It's always been

15:41.125 --> 15:44.667
just Dad and me.

15:44.709 --> 15:47.375
Not Dad, me, and...

15:47.417 --> 15:48.959
Me?

15:49.000 --> 15:52.250
Well, then, perhaps we take it

15:49.000 --> 15:52.250
one step at a time.

15:52.291 --> 15:54.500
First step is:

15:52.291 --> 15:54.500
call me Anna.

15:54.542 --> 15:55.917
Close second?

15:55.959 --> 15:58.959
Stop calling me Francine.

15:55.959 --> 15:58.959
And third,

15:59.000 --> 16:01.125
we figure a way

15:59.000 --> 16:01.125
out of here.

16:01.166 --> 16:03.208
How do we get past

16:01.166 --> 16:03.208
those drones?

16:03.250 --> 16:07.458
Huh. Tell me exactly how does

16:03.250 --> 16:07.458
your holo-watch work?

16:09.750 --> 16:13.083
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:14.834 --> 16:17.709
QUARRY:

16:14.834 --> 16:17.709
And what good would

16:14.834 --> 16:17.709
a live demonstration be

16:17.750 --> 16:21.291
without showing off

16:17.750 --> 16:21.291
their evasive abilities?

16:25.041 --> 16:27.041
( grunting )

16:33.250 --> 16:35.041
( growling )

16:37.875 --> 16:40.417
Optimus, no!

16:41.458 --> 16:42.792
(  ominous theme playing  )

16:42.834 --> 16:44.291
QUARRY:

16:42.834 --> 16:44.291
No!

16:44.333 --> 16:46.208
No, no, no, no!

16:46.250 --> 16:48.250
That half-wit scientist!

16:48.291 --> 16:51.041
How can I sell creatures

16:48.291 --> 16:51.041
that attack each other

16:51.083 --> 16:52.959
and then get buried alive?!

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
( growling )

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
Boulder, stop!

16:55.041 --> 16:56.917
But Optimus!

16:55.041 --> 16:56.917
He's in there!

16:56.959 --> 16:58.375
We can't pull him out.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.166
We're not Rescue Bots now,

16:58.417 --> 17:00.166
remember?

17:00.208 --> 17:03.542
But he saved Chase.

17:00.208 --> 17:03.542
By pretending to attack me.

17:03.583 --> 17:05.709
We must follow his lead

17:03.583 --> 17:05.709
and keep up the illusion

17:05.750 --> 17:07.166
that we are ferocious animals.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.208
Heh-heh.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.208
Fine by me.

17:10.250 --> 17:13.291
Aah! Heatwave?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.709
Fight back.

17:14.750 --> 17:16.417
We'll work our way

17:14.750 --> 17:16.417
over to Optimus.

17:16.458 --> 17:19.000
Excellent strategy.

17:16.458 --> 17:19.000
And challenge accepted.

17:21.583 --> 17:23.834
( both growling )

17:25.750 --> 17:27.375
I want in on this.

17:27.417 --> 17:28.917
( growling )

17:28.959 --> 17:30.375
QUARRY:

17:28.959 --> 17:30.375
My profits!

17:30.417 --> 17:32.917
My pro--

17:32.959 --> 17:34.667
My profits!

17:34.709 --> 17:37.667
Go! Go!

17:34.709 --> 17:37.667
Fight! Fight!

17:37.709 --> 17:40.250
You heard the man.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.250
Let's finish this!

17:40.291 --> 17:43.375
Then I suggest we end

17:40.291 --> 17:43.375
this charade and finish him.

17:52.250 --> 17:54.000
( roars )

17:54.041 --> 17:55.834
Sold!

17:55.875 --> 17:58.000
To the highest bidders!

17:58.041 --> 18:01.750
Well done, Rescue Bots.

17:58.041 --> 18:01.750
And thank you.

18:01.792 --> 18:04.792
Now let's show Quarry

18:01.792 --> 18:04.792
what we do at our day jobs.

18:04.834 --> 18:08.583
Amber Drone,

18:04.834 --> 18:08.583
stop those beautiful beasts

18:08.625 --> 18:11.041
before they tear

18:08.625 --> 18:11.041
each other apart.

18:17.333 --> 18:20.208
Ha-ha-ha!

18:17.333 --> 18:20.208
Magnificent!

18:20.250 --> 18:23.709
Load everything up, boys,

18:20.250 --> 18:23.709
and take 'em to the dock.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.917
Heh. Once they're shipped off,

18:25.959 --> 18:28.291
I'll talk to Doc Greene and

18:28.333 --> 18:32.250
reevaluate the terms

18:28.333 --> 18:32.250
of his release.

18:43.375 --> 18:47.166
We did it!

18:43.375 --> 18:47.166
Nice work, Profe-- Anna.

18:49.291 --> 18:52.000
Now let's get off this wretched

18:49.291 --> 18:52.000
island and get back home.

18:52.041 --> 18:54.083
( leaves rustling )

18:54.125 --> 18:56.875
It could be Quarry.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.875
This way.

18:59.291 --> 19:01.625
These goggles

18:59.291 --> 19:01.625
are a bit primitive.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.458
But I'm reading

19:01.667 --> 19:05.458
two heat signatures

19:05.500 --> 19:07.166
inside this shed.

19:07.208 --> 19:10.125
It must be Frankie

19:07.208 --> 19:10.125
and Anna.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.709
Dad! You're here!

19:11.750 --> 19:13.208
Not now, Frankie.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.500
I have to deactivate

19:13.250 --> 19:15.500
this security system

19:15.542 --> 19:16.750
to rescue Frankie and--

19:16.792 --> 19:19.500
Oh! You're here too!

19:19.542 --> 19:21.750
Heh-heh!

19:19.542 --> 19:21.750
How did you two escape?

19:21.792 --> 19:23.208
Because we're awesome.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.750
And exponentially awesomer

19:23.250 --> 19:25.750
when we work together.

19:25.792 --> 19:27.792
Noble!

19:25.792 --> 19:27.792
Now let's go tell--

19:27.834 --> 19:30.375
I mean, find the dinos.

19:32.375 --> 19:34.041
This is bad.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.792
It appears the larger drone

19:35.834 --> 19:38.875
has trapped the dinos

19:35.834 --> 19:38.875
in some kind of stasis field.

19:38.917 --> 19:41.083
Can one of you pilot

19:38.917 --> 19:41.083
the helicopter bot?

19:41.125 --> 19:43.834
We could knock that drone out

19:41.125 --> 19:43.834
easily from the air.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.917
Um, the helicopter bot

19:43.875 --> 19:45.917
can't fly.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.417
I don't understand.

19:47.458 --> 19:49.500
What good is a flying robot

19:47.458 --> 19:49.500
that can't fly?

19:49.542 --> 19:53.959
No, I mean it can,

19:49.542 --> 19:53.959
he just needs some repairs.

19:54.000 --> 19:56.792
No! She's right.

19:56.834 --> 19:59.125
I should be doing

19:56.834 --> 19:59.125
what I'm meant to do.

19:59.166 --> 20:00.834
I'm going!

20:00.875 --> 20:04.375
What on earth?

20:00.875 --> 20:04.375
He's... sentient?

20:04.417 --> 20:07.667
Come on. Come on!

20:09.667 --> 20:11.625
Fly!

20:11.667 --> 20:14.792
(  majestic theme playing  )

20:29.041 --> 20:30.333
( Quarry screams )

20:33.125 --> 20:35.834
(  dramatic theme playing  )

20:35.875 --> 20:37.333
( button beeps )

20:39.250 --> 20:41.000
BURNS:

20:39.250 --> 20:41.000
Hold it right there!

20:41.041 --> 20:43.375
Colonel Quarry,

20:41.041 --> 20:43.375
We have you surrounded.

20:43.417 --> 20:45.125
You are under arrest!

20:45.166 --> 20:46.625
( sighs )

20:48.291 --> 20:51.333
(  peaceful theme playing  )

20:56.542 --> 20:59.250
BURNS:

20:56.542 --> 20:59.250
Great work, team.

20:56.542 --> 20:59.250
All of you.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.667
( in robotic voice ):

20:59.291 --> 21:00.667
Thank you, chief.

21:00.709 --> 21:04.875
It is what we were, uh,

21:00.709 --> 21:04.875
programmed for.

21:04.917 --> 21:06.875
I may not have a degree

21:04.917 --> 21:06.875
in robotics.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.542
But I'm smart enough to know

21:08.583 --> 21:10.792
that whatever

21:08.583 --> 21:10.792
you Rescue Bots are,

21:10.834 --> 21:13.208
you are not man-made.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.542
But you are heroes.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.250
And anything else

21:15.583 --> 21:18.250
is irrelevant.

21:20.917 --> 21:23.834
A wise and generous

21:20.917 --> 21:23.834
statement, professor.

21:23.875 --> 21:26.125
I thank you

21:23.875 --> 21:26.125
for your empathy.

21:26.166 --> 21:30.583
And welcome you

21:26.166 --> 21:30.583
to our family.
