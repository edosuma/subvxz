WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:10.178
- *

00:10.278 --> 00:12.346
- Mom, guess what?

00:12.446 --> 00:14.448
There is just the cutest
new boy at school.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.984
- Ooh, yay, tell me
everything.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.419
- He's a rocker.
- Oooh.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.721
- He writes the most
beautiful lyrics...

00:20.821 --> 00:22.790
- Oooh.
- And his name is Oyster.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.858
- Okay, you lost me.

00:24.958 --> 00:28.862
- Here, listen to these lyrics
he wrote for English class.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.232
It's called
"Goodbye Mikaila."

00:31.332 --> 00:32.733
[clears throat]

00:32.833 --> 00:34.368
"I shed tears
on your neck

00:34.468 --> 00:35.869
"As we say goodbye.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.171
"Don't know how
I'll go on without you,

00:37.271 --> 00:40.641
but I'll try."

00:40.741 --> 00:43.544
- I'm sorry,
his name is Oyster?

00:43.644 --> 00:46.114
- It's cute.
Get over it.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.881
Wish he'd write
a song about me.

00:47.981 --> 00:49.717
If only I knew someone
who could introduce me to him.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.786
- Hey, guys, this is Oyster.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.054
- Whaddup?

00:54.155 --> 00:55.123
- Hi!

00:55.223 --> 00:56.257
I mean, yo!

00:56.357 --> 00:57.858
I mean, hey!

00:57.958 --> 00:59.460
- Here, Phoebe,
have a brownie.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.163
Uh, what she was
trying to say

01:02.263 --> 01:05.733
is welcome to
our home, Oyster.

01:05.833 --> 01:07.901
- Thanks,
and fair warning...

01:08.001 --> 01:09.437
we're gonna rock it to
its foundation.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.704
- Yeah, we started a band
with a group of guys

01:10.804 --> 01:13.174
a couple of days ago and our
first gig's this weekend.

01:13.274 --> 01:16.144
Yeah, that's right.
I'm giggin'!

01:16.177 --> 01:19.213
- Yeah? Well, I gigged
back in my day.

01:19.313 --> 01:22.049
I had a band called
Barb Jovial.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.252
Show ya a little taste
of my moves.

01:24.352 --> 01:26.754
* Ba da da da dang

01:29.890 --> 01:31.225
- Dude, if we don't go
and rehearse hard,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.394
that's how embarrassing
we'll look.

01:33.494 --> 01:34.862
- Nice, uh...
Nice meeting you.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.364
- Oh.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.766
- Um, okay, bye!
I mean, I'll see ya!

01:38.866 --> 01:41.302
I mean, Aloha,
which is hi and goodbye!

01:41.402 --> 01:43.036
Mom!

01:43.171 --> 01:44.805
Where were you with
that brownie?

01:44.905 --> 01:46.974
You let me get
to Aloha.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.911
- *

01:51.011 --> 01:52.346
* What you see

01:52.446 --> 01:53.881
* Is not what you get

01:53.981 --> 01:57.017
* Livin' our lives
with a secret *

01:57.185 --> 01:58.486
* We fit right in

01:58.586 --> 02:00.321
* Bet you'd never guessed

02:00.421 --> 02:01.689
* 'Cause we're
livin' our lives *

02:01.789 --> 02:03.657
* Just like all the rest

02:03.757 --> 02:05.359
* A picture
perfect family *

02:05.459 --> 02:07.195
* Is what we try to be

02:07.295 --> 02:08.596
* Look closer,
you might see *

02:08.696 --> 02:10.598
* The crazy things we do

02:10.698 --> 02:11.999
* This isn't
make believe *

02:12.099 --> 02:13.634
* It's our reality

02:13.734 --> 02:15.203
* Just your average family

02:15.269 --> 02:18.506
* Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble *

02:18.606 --> 02:21.475
* Livin' a double life

02:27.114 --> 02:29.350
- I can't have a singing
rabbit in my lair.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.252
It was hard enough
explaining your wig.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.255
- Wig?
Oh, how dare you.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.357
This is my real hair.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.826
- Oh, ho, the band
needs fuel.

02:38.926 --> 02:41.329
I'll take those.
- Oh!

02:41.429 --> 02:43.264
No, I wanna
bring 'em down.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.566
I need an Oyster do-over.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.235
- No way.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.737
I cannot have you interrupting
the Max-Eyed Peas.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.340
We're workin' on
a band name, okay?

02:57.445 --> 02:59.280
- Look, not that you
would even care,

02:59.380 --> 03:01.582
but I think Oyster
is cute,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.484
and I kinda wanted
to talk to him.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.586
- You and Oyster?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.355
The Oyster that's
downstairs?

03:07.455 --> 03:08.856
Oyster in my band?

03:08.956 --> 03:10.858
- How many Oysters
do you know?

03:10.958 --> 03:14.094
- Phoebe, Oyster
is...is a bad boy.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.363
He's a rocker.

03:15.463 --> 03:19.533
He sweats poetry and shreds like
a six-armed mutant.

03:19.633 --> 03:23.971
- So, I sweat.
I shred.

03:24.071 --> 03:27.341
- Yo, Max, you got
a bottle opener?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.343
Actually, never mind.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.812
- [lid pops]

03:31.912 --> 03:33.614
- [spits out lid]

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
- See? Bad boy.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.387
Trust me, Phoebe,
you guys...

03:39.487 --> 03:41.589
are not a good match.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.957
- Yeah, well,
if that's true,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.560
then how come
I can do this?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.396
Ah! Arg!

03:48.496 --> 03:50.864
- FYI. What you're
doing isn't bad.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.100
It's just embarrassing.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.374
- I can't believe
we're gonna be the only kids

04:00.474 --> 04:02.976
in school whose parents aren't
coming to Career Day.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.212
- That's because, if they talk
about being superheroes,

04:05.313 --> 04:07.981
they might give away
that they're superheroes!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.083
- Tonight will be way cool.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.184
My dad's a firefighter

04:11.319 --> 04:13.321
and Chase's mom's
a doctor.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.489
What do you parents
do, Billy?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.325
- Um, they're retired.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.927
It's a fancy word
for "lazy."

04:20.027 --> 04:21.595
- So, they just sit
around all day,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.731
where our parents are
out saving the world?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.333
- My dad saves things.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.800
- Like what?

04:26.900 --> 04:28.802
A spot on the couch
for your mom?

04:28.902 --> 04:30.338
[laughing]

04:30.438 --> 04:32.373
Cool parents swap.

04:32.473 --> 04:34.041
- My dad is way cooler
than yours.

04:34.141 --> 04:36.043
He's a superhero.
- Billy!

04:36.143 --> 04:38.045
- Wait, are you serious?

04:38.145 --> 04:41.048
- Yeah, he can fly,
and he's super strong,

04:41.148 --> 04:42.616
and he has a really
tight uniform

04:42.716 --> 04:45.185
that he used to
look great in.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.720
- Wow! Did you
hear that, guys?

04:46.820 --> 04:50.624
We're gonna
meet a real superhero.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.793
- I just had
the craziest dream

04:52.893 --> 04:54.895
that I told everybody Dad
was a superhero.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.397
- And I just had
a crazy dream

04:56.497 --> 04:59.567
where I dragged you
out of here by the ear.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.370
- Wake up, Nora,
wake up!

05:02.436 --> 05:07.207
- [loud rock music]

05:10.378 --> 05:13.013
[music stops]

05:13.113 --> 05:18.251
- Dudes, we rocked so hard,
an angel fell from the sky.

05:18.386 --> 05:20.388
- This is why
I joined a band.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.493
- Phoebe, I told
you yesterday

05:25.593 --> 05:27.495
not to interrupt my band.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.896
And why are you
wearing that?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.664
- To prove you wrong.

05:30.764 --> 05:32.132
[clears throat]

05:32.232 --> 05:34.802
Hey, guys, I didn't mean to
crash the party.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.270
Cool guitar.
Whatever. I don't care.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.873
- Thanks.
She's my heart and soul.

05:39.973 --> 05:40.941
I found her
at a yard sale

05:41.041 --> 05:43.844
under a pair of
granny panties.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.880
- Oh, I'm caught on
your granny panty guitar.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.816
I mean, whatever.
I don't care.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.651
- [material rips]
- [guitar feedback screeches]

05:50.751 --> 05:52.285
- Ow, my eyes!
- [cymbals crashing]

05:52.420 --> 05:53.721
- Whatever. Whatever.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.424
- [mic stands clattering]
- [drums thudding]

05:56.457 --> 06:00.428
- Oh! Oh!
- She's killin' the music.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.895
- Phoebe, get out!

06:01.995 --> 06:03.897
- I'll get
out when I want to.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.899
Point me towards
the stairs.

06:12.440 --> 06:16.477
- Looks like someone's
trying too hard.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.446
- Cut it, fur-face.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.680
I just made a fool
out of myself,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.949
and now Oyster's never gonna
write a song about me.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.651
- I'll write a song
about you.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.353
* Phoebe
you're really creepy *

06:26.454 --> 06:29.623
* Ooh! Phoebe you
smell like-- *

06:29.723 --> 06:34.227
I was gonna say peaches.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.463
- Hey.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.030
Just lookin' to score
some paper towels.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.966
- I'm so sorry for ruining
your band practice.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.468
- Are you kidding?

06:40.568 --> 06:42.470
That was the most rock 'n roll
thing I've ever seen.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.372
Max never told me his sister
was so sweeches.

06:45.473 --> 06:46.874
- Thanks.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.576
I mean, whatever.
I don't care.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.178
- [ornaments shattering]

06:51.278 --> 06:55.215
- You...you are
some kind of thrash goddess.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.784
- Yeah, that's me.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.787
I love gettin'
my trash on.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.855
- [shelf & objects clatter]

07:04.592 --> 07:07.495
- You're blowing my mind!

07:07.528 --> 07:09.497
- Yeah, take that,
knickknacks!

07:13.000 --> 07:15.235
- [sniffing]
Sloppy Joes.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.571
That's why we chose
this school.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.072
- Guys, what's going on?

07:19.172 --> 07:20.941
We've been waiting outside
for half an hour.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.242
- Billy, do you
wanna tell them

07:22.342 --> 07:25.045
that you signed Dad up for
Career Day as a superhero?

07:25.145 --> 07:26.980
- No, thank you.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.584
So, who's up for
Sloppy Joes?

07:30.684 --> 07:31.919
- This guy!

07:32.019 --> 07:34.788
- Hank, did you not hear
what they just said?

07:34.888 --> 07:37.257
- Joes. Sloppy.
Career Day.

07:37.357 --> 07:40.293
[gasps] You told everybody
I'm a superhero?

07:40.393 --> 07:42.530
- Billy, you know your
Dad can't show up here

07:42.630 --> 07:44.064
as Thunderman.

07:44.164 --> 07:46.166
- I tried to tell him,
but he wouldn't listen.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.137
So, if you're not gonna
spank him, I got this.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.839
- I know it was wrong.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.642
But I just wanted to
brag about how great you are.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.410
- Well, I am pretty great.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.614
I'll tell you what--
what if I come to Career Day

08:00.714 --> 08:04.051
and pretend to be someone
even better than Thunderman?

08:04.151 --> 08:07.888
- A flame-juggling
Doctor-Astronaut?

08:07.988 --> 08:10.057
- Pick a school based
on Sloppy Joes,

08:10.157 --> 08:12.660
that's what ya get.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.563
- I got this scar
from stage-diving

08:15.596 --> 08:17.865
off my Mom's mini-van.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.568
- That's nothin'.

08:20.634 --> 08:23.737
I got this one
from a motocross wipeout.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.172
I just looks like
a mosquito bite

08:25.272 --> 08:27.941
that got infected
after I scratched it too much.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.177
- Sweeches!

08:30.277 --> 08:31.779
You know, I don't think
it was an accident

08:31.879 --> 08:34.381
you got tangled up
with my guitar, Phoebe.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.383
I think my guitar
chose you.

08:36.483 --> 08:39.587
- No, Oyster, I chose you
to be in our band--

08:39.653 --> 08:43.591
Maxford and Sons.

08:43.624 --> 08:47.194
Phoebe, stop distracting Oyster
from his life-long passion--

08:47.294 --> 08:49.763
the band we created
yesterday in gym class.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.832
- Yeah, man, we made an oath
and sealed it with sweat

08:51.932 --> 08:54.668
while Gideon tried to
do a pull-up.

08:54.768 --> 08:57.437
- Muscles are first
sell-outs.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.808
- I can't have a band mate
dating my sister.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.610
Are you with us
or are you with Phoebe?

09:02.676 --> 09:04.978
- I told you, Max, my guitar's
my heart and soul.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.714
- I knew you'd make
the right choice.

09:06.814 --> 09:07.715
Let's go rehearse.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.617
- You're not hearin'
me, bros.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.619
My guitar chose Phoebe.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.954
And so do I.
- What?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.956
- Uh, he said his guitar--
- I heard him.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.996
- Phoebe, putting
this band together

09:23.096 --> 09:24.497
is the coolest thing I've done
since we moved here.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.999
You can't steal Oyster.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.200
- Well, I guess you
shouldn't have said

09:27.300 --> 09:28.368
I wasn't a good
match for him.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.070
I want an apology.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.338
- Okay.

09:31.438 --> 09:32.640
I'm sorry...

09:32.740 --> 09:35.008
you look like that.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.443
Phoebe, just go break
up with him,

09:36.543 --> 09:37.778
so he can play
our gig tomorrow.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.047
- Why? I like him
and he likes me.

09:40.147 --> 09:42.382
- No, he likes the bad girl
you're pretending to be

09:42.482 --> 09:44.384
which you can't see
through all that

09:44.484 --> 09:46.720
eye makeup
you never wear.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.256
- I can see fine.

09:49.356 --> 09:50.724
- You're squishing
Colosso.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.227
- Yeah, get your jagged
elbows off of me!

09:54.327 --> 09:58.031
- We're done here. Oyster and I
are going out for pizza.

09:58.131 --> 09:59.867
- Phoebe, you two will
not last.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.434
- Oh, we will.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.072
Oyster already thinks
I'm sweet cheese.

10:05.172 --> 10:08.475
- It's sweeches! You don't even
speak his language.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.479
- [applauding]

10:12.579 --> 10:15.115
- I can't wait to see what job
Dad's pretending to have.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.217
He said it's going to be
better than a superhero.

10:17.317 --> 10:21.254
- I hope so. Morgan's looking
extra judgy tonight.

10:21.354 --> 10:26.626
- So, in other words,
you're a bus driver in the sky.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.695
- HANK: [laughing]

10:27.795 --> 10:29.162
Huh? What do ya think?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
I'm an alligator
wrestler.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.500
Now your class won't care
that I'm not a superhero.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.002
- Yeah, 'cause
they'll think

10:35.102 --> 10:37.437
you're the less cool
version of that guy.

10:37.537 --> 10:40.640
- [growling, snorting]

10:40.741 --> 10:45.112
- Shoulda gone with
rodeo clown.

10:45.212 --> 10:48.448
Does anyone around here
have a boring job?

10:48.548 --> 10:51.985
- Uh, Mr. Thunderman,
you're up.

10:52.085 --> 10:55.155
- Can I have a second
to collect my lies?

10:55.255 --> 10:57.691
- What?
- Nothing. I'm going.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.929
[laughing]
Hi, kids.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.064
I am Hank Thunderman,

11:04.164 --> 11:06.900
and I am an honest-to-goodness,
real life...

11:11.171 --> 11:14.908
plumber.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.476
- I shoulda known Billy
was lying.

11:16.576 --> 11:17.878
His dad's not a superhero.

11:17.978 --> 11:21.749
- Oh, hey, plumbers are the
superheroes of waste management.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.416
We plunge
the clogs of evil

11:23.516 --> 11:26.519
and we flush
the pipes of injustice!

11:26.619 --> 11:29.089
- Wrap it up, Dad.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.259
- You know what might
impress these kids?

11:32.359 --> 11:33.827
If you fix the, uh,

11:33.927 --> 11:36.129
leaky water fountain in
the hallway for free.

11:36.229 --> 11:37.798
- Oh, great idea.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.367
Who wants to see me fix
the drinking fountain?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.402
- For free!

11:42.502 --> 11:45.538
- You think we're gonna
choose you over that?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.574
- [alligator snarling,
snapping]

11:47.674 --> 11:50.243
- I sure wouldn't.

11:50.343 --> 11:57.184
- *

11:57.284 --> 11:58.952
- Phoebe?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.088
Look at you.
- Oh, thank you.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.790
- No, I mean,
you look stupid.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.224
[laughing]

12:08.295 --> 12:10.430
- Oh, sorry.
My guitar has to sit here.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
She always eats with me.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.635
- Okay.

12:15.803 --> 12:16.970
- It's date night.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.939
Ooh, time to get a pic
of me and my baby.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.173
- [laughing]

12:20.273 --> 12:22.575
And you were talking
about your guitar again.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.244
- [phone camera clicks]

12:24.344 --> 12:26.713
- Yep. It's me and her
against the world.

12:26.814 --> 12:29.482
It has been ever since
I lost Mikaila.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.351
- Wait, as in
"Goodbye Mikaila"?

12:31.451 --> 12:34.087
Those lyrics were
so beautiful.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.824
You'll write a song about
me one day?

12:36.890 --> 12:39.659
- No.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.461
- Excuse me?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.964
- I only write songs
about my guitars.

12:44.064 --> 12:48.135
- Wait, so, Mikaila
is a guitar?

12:48.235 --> 12:50.270
- She was,
'til I accidentally

12:50.370 --> 12:52.840
dropped her out of
a hot air balloon.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.841
I thought I'd never
find love again,

12:53.941 --> 12:57.945
'til I met Patty.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.746
- [thinking]
Oh, I see now.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.850
He's crazy.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.084
But he's cute.

13:04.184 --> 13:09.622
Maybe if I squint really hard,
I won't see the crazy.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.725
Nope, still crazy.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.327
We really aren't
a good match.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.263
I hate it when
Max is right.

13:16.363 --> 13:20.400
Oyster, I have
something to tell you.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.768
I'm not really sure what--

13:21.869 --> 13:24.504
Max is doing here!

13:24.604 --> 13:26.874
Excuse me for
a second, Oyster.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.441
Patty.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.910
[sighs]
What are you doing here, Max?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
- I'm gonna show Oyster
bad Phoebe's a lie,

13:32.045 --> 13:34.714
break you up, and order
a mushroom calzone to go!

13:34.882 --> 13:35.782
- Seriously?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.918
- Yeah, I'm super hungry.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.753
And, yeah, you're about
to be super single.

13:40.888 --> 13:42.089
- Max, you should have
stayed home

13:42.189 --> 13:45.358
because you just woke
up bad Phoebe.

13:45.458 --> 13:49.729
- [cutlery clatters]
- Ah! Pick those up.

13:49.897 --> 13:52.532
- Yes, Mrs. Wong.

13:52.632 --> 13:56.036
- Oyster, since you like
my sister so much,

13:56.136 --> 13:58.906
I spent my birthday money
on jumbo pictures

13:58.972 --> 14:01.141
to show you who
she really is.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.277
- Dinner and a show.
Awe-sedelic.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.914
- This is your bad girl
at the petting zoo

14:06.980 --> 14:11.218
with a cute little
sheep last week.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.153
- Yeah, right before
I shaved my initials

14:13.253 --> 14:17.257
into its fuzzy
little butt.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.727
- Here is Phoebe's idea
of a good time at the beach.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.196
- Is that a metal detector?

14:23.296 --> 14:28.268
- Yeah, I use it to
trip lifeguards.

14:28.368 --> 14:33.106
- And there she is helping
an old lady cross the street.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.142
- What's wrong with that?

14:35.242 --> 14:36.443
- Uh...

14:36.543 --> 14:39.446
Look at the sheep
one again.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.448
- You look really
cute in this picture.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.750
- Aw. Thank you.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.385
- You two make me sick.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.454
- Oh, baby, did he get you?
- No, I'm okay.

14:47.554 --> 14:51.524
And you were talking
to your guitar again.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.427
- [electric guitar music]

15:00.167 --> 15:01.634
- What are you guys doing?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.536
- Gideon found
a new guitar player.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.973
- She shreds like
a lady wizard.

15:06.006 --> 15:09.376
- [electric guitar music]

15:09.476 --> 15:14.181
- My mom's not gonna be
a member of Bruno Max.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.317
Well, I don't see you
two comin' up with names.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.186
- What if I come
up with a name?

15:19.286 --> 15:22.189
- No, Mom, we're gonna
get Oyster back.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
- I don't see why we can't
have three guitarists,

15:24.657 --> 15:26.693
especially a pretty one
that smells nice.

15:29.162 --> 15:33.366
- Gideon, not cool.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.668
- But what if you don't
get Oyster back?

15:35.768 --> 15:38.871
Then can I be
in your band?

15:39.006 --> 15:41.041
- If my new plan to
get Oyster back fails,

15:41.141 --> 15:42.709
and if every guitarist
in the world

15:42.809 --> 15:45.212
breaks both their hands,
yes, you can be in the band.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.213
- Yes!!

15:46.313 --> 15:50.450
- [electric guitar music]

15:50.550 --> 15:51.884
- So, this plan to
get Oyster back,

15:52.019 --> 15:54.321
it's a good one, right?

15:54.421 --> 15:55.755
- We'll have to find out.

15:55.855 --> 16:00.027
Hey, there they are--
Hiddenville's cutest couple.

16:00.127 --> 16:03.896
Hey, I'm really sorry that
I interrupted your date.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.665
- He's being nice.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.601
We should leave before
something heavy hits us.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.770
- No, Phoebe, I'm being
sincere, okay?

16:10.870 --> 16:13.540
I even got you a gift
to show Oyster

16:13.640 --> 16:16.243
you really are
the ultimate rocker girl.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.944
Chainsaw!

16:21.781 --> 16:25.752
He's gonna give you guys
matching Mohawks.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.222
- That's the most romantic
idea I've ever heard.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.823
- Yeah, Max.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.792
[through gritted teeth]
How can I thank you?

16:32.892 --> 16:35.362
- By going first.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.735
- The elbow pipe
is connected to...

16:42.835 --> 16:44.271
the squiggly pipe
which means

16:44.371 --> 16:46.239
if I loosen
this cappy thing...

16:46.339 --> 16:49.109
- [water spurts]
- Ah!

16:49.209 --> 16:51.244
That happens.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.846
Oh, hey, buddy,
I'm almost done here.

16:53.946 --> 16:56.683
- You can stop now, Dad.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.285
- I know you're
disappointed, son.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.187
I am, too. I...

17:00.287 --> 17:02.389
I really wanted to
impress your classmates.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.790
- Don't worry about them.

17:03.890 --> 17:07.694
They're busy watching
an alligator chew on a clown.

17:07.794 --> 17:08.828
- Really?

17:08.928 --> 17:10.897
You're not upset
they don't think I'm a hero?

17:10.997 --> 17:14.667
- No. You're my hero
just for showing up today.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.336
- Thanks, Billy.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.371
Hey, since it's just
the two of us,

17:18.471 --> 17:20.307
how about you
watch your old man

17:20.407 --> 17:22.809
fix these pipes
Thunderman style?

17:22.909 --> 17:25.512
- [laughs]
Cool.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.647
- [metal clanking]

17:27.747 --> 17:28.781
- Ah.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.117
Ha! Ha!

17:30.217 --> 17:31.351
Never doubt
the skills of a man

17:31.451 --> 17:34.187
too cheap to pay
for a real plumber.

17:34.287 --> 17:35.288
[kisses]

17:35.388 --> 17:39.126
- [pipes rumbling,
whining]

17:43.463 --> 17:47.567
- Oh, no, Dad's
fixing things.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.802
- [water splattering]

17:49.902 --> 17:52.539
- Uh-oh, Morgan,
you should--

17:52.639 --> 17:54.774
- I should what, Nora?

17:54.874 --> 17:56.143
- I was gonna say

17:56.243 --> 17:59.612
you should just sit
tight and enjoy the show.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.881
- Already on it, Snora.

18:01.981 --> 18:02.882
- [metal creaking]

18:02.982 --> 18:05.385
- [pipes burst]
- [screaming]

18:11.924 --> 18:14.727
- KIDS: [screaming]
- [alarm bell ringing]

18:16.396 --> 18:18.798
- You're flooding
the entire building!

18:18.898 --> 18:19.966
- Your dad did this?

18:20.066 --> 18:21.834
- Uh-huh,
and thanks to him,

18:21.934 --> 18:24.371
we'll have to cancel school
at least a week.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.173
[groans]

18:26.273 --> 18:28.475
- Wait. No school
for a week?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.677
Your dad really
is a superhero.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.212
- I told you.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.813
Thanks, Dad.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.618
- Wait, did you flood the school
on purpose for Billy?

18:38.718 --> 18:40.653
- Of course, I did.

18:40.753 --> 18:41.721
You're not buying it,
are ya?

18:41.821 --> 18:44.191
- Not even a little.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.660
- Phoebe, don't be nervous.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.363
Patty and I are
right here by your side.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.266
- How comforting.

18:53.366 --> 18:57.003
- Come on, Phoebe.
Chainsaw's time is precious.

18:57.103 --> 18:59.606
He needs to get
back to prison.

18:59.706 --> 19:02.242
- I give free haircuts
to the inmates.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.977
I'm a sweetheart
like that.

19:05.077 --> 19:08.515
- Max, how do you
know this dude?

19:08.615 --> 19:12.319
- I don't.
Thank you, Internet.

19:12.419 --> 19:16.789
There you go, Chainsaw.
Let 'er rip.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.124
- [razor buzzing]

19:18.225 --> 19:20.360
- * My baby
is an Indy Rock girl *

19:20.460 --> 19:23.496
* Oh Oh Oh Oh

19:23.596 --> 19:24.997
* 'Cause she likes to rock

19:25.097 --> 19:26.366
* The Indy Rock world

19:26.466 --> 19:27.600
- [laughing]

19:27.700 --> 19:29.135
- * Oh Oh Oh Oh

19:29.236 --> 19:31.003
* She's so nice

19:32.138 --> 19:34.040
* She's so nice

19:35.308 --> 19:37.510
* She's so nice

19:37.610 --> 19:40.247
* She loves me

19:40.347 --> 19:42.882
- Ahhhhhhhhhh!!

19:45.017 --> 19:46.286
- [glass shatters]

19:46.386 --> 19:48.154
- Ahhhhhhhhhh!!

19:48.255 --> 19:50.557
I can't do it.
I love my hair.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.160
It's so rich and full
and soft.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.161
- Phoebe, come on.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.263
You're the baddest
girl I know.

19:56.296 --> 19:57.964
You got this.

19:58.064 --> 20:00.733
- No, Oyster,
I got nothing, 'cause...

20:00.833 --> 20:03.202
I'm not a bad girl.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.104
- What are you
talking about?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.973
- Mmm, I'm a good girl.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.009
I love sheep and I think
metal detectors are cool.

20:10.109 --> 20:12.445
I found this earring
at the beach.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.082
I'm sorry, but we're just not
really a good match.

20:16.182 --> 20:18.017
- [exaggerated gasp]

20:18.117 --> 20:21.153
I did not see
that coming.

20:21.254 --> 20:23.690
I wait--I did.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.258
- But my guitar chose you.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.760
She never steers
me wrong.

20:27.860 --> 20:32.499
- Well, it looks like
she's changed her mind.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.268
- Oh, this is weird.

20:35.368 --> 20:39.706
- Wow, Max, she really
likes you.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.774
Is anyone else getting
uncomfortable or...

20:41.874 --> 20:44.311
- I know I am.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.113
- Okay, I guess Patty
has spoken.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.015
Max, will you take
me back in the band?

20:49.115 --> 20:50.517
Whatever it's called.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.018
- If you don't come back,

20:52.118 --> 20:53.953
my mom's gonna be
our lead guitarist.

20:54.053 --> 20:56.689
- So, go ahead and take
the weekend to think about it.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.327
- Gideon, not cool!

21:00.427 --> 21:02.395
- And don't worry, Phoebe,
we're still sweeches.

21:02.495 --> 21:03.930
- Yeah, that's nice.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.732
But I think Chainsaw's
stealing our microwave.

21:10.069 --> 21:11.671
- MAX: It's tough
coming up with a name

21:11.771 --> 21:13.573
that truly captures
this band,

21:13.673 --> 21:16.108
but I think we did it.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.678
From this point,
we will forever be known

21:18.778 --> 21:21.648
as Max's--Mom!

21:21.748 --> 21:24.183
- Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

21:24.351 --> 21:25.184
- Mom, what are you
doing here?

21:25.352 --> 21:26.185
- Well, Gideon called
and said that

21:26.353 --> 21:28.521
you wanted me
in the band.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.791
- Gideon, not cool.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.361
- Looking good, Barb.
- Aw...

21:34.461 --> 21:38.565
- Gideon, not cool.

21:38.665 --> 21:39.966
- This is the first song
I've written

21:40.066 --> 21:42.001
that's not about
a guitar.

21:42.101 --> 21:43.035
It's about a special
little lady

21:43.135 --> 21:45.037
who satisfied a hunger
in my soul.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.573
- Aw...

21:46.673 --> 21:48.541
- Where are you,
Mrs. Wong?

21:48.641 --> 21:51.778
- I right here.

21:51.878 --> 21:54.681
- She gets a song?!

21:54.781 --> 21:58.385
I mean, whatever.
I don't care.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.853
- [rock music]
