nobody from 57th Street
can even get in,

08:37.038 --> 08:38.909
'cause they won't want to get
their clothes wet.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.737
And we can fill it
with alligators

08:40.781 --> 08:42.783
and those
flesh-eating fish.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.132
Um...

08:44.175 --> 08:46.134
- I was thinking
more in terms

08:46.177 --> 08:48.919
of some security cameras
or a metal detector.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.575
- I could get a gun.
- No. You are not getting a gun.

08:52.619 --> 08:54.229
- You don't trust me
with a gun?

08:54.272 --> 08:56.536
- I don't trust you
with a walkie-talkie.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.189
- Ugh.

08:58.233 --> 09:00.365
I just dropped one walkie-talkie
off of the rafters

09:00.409 --> 09:03.151
and gave one person
one tiny concussion.

09:03.194 --> 09:05.501
- It wasn't just a person.
It was a toddler.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.199
- Well, exactly.
It was a tiny concussion.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.375
- Okay. Fine.

09:10.419 --> 09:13.074
I'll give you the background
test for prospective gun owners,

09:13.117 --> 09:15.076
and we'll see how great
you do on that one.

09:15.119 --> 09:17.905
- Do you think I need
a number-two pencil for that?

09:19.646 --> 09:23.171
- Well, Donny Deutsch,
this has been really great.

09:23.214 --> 09:25.086
I think I should get
back to the office.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.957
- No, no, no rush. I know you're
probably worried about me,

09:27.001 --> 09:30.308
because you think, you know,
big-time ad guy, TV personality.

09:30.352 --> 09:31.832
I carved out
some time for you,

09:31.875 --> 09:33.398
so you don't have to worry
about it.

09:33.442 --> 09:36.184
- Okay.
- Yeah. No, this is kind of fun.

09:36.227 --> 09:38.621
You know, I don't usually like
to talk about my money,

09:38.665 --> 09:41.276
but, um,
people think sometimes

09:41.319 --> 09:43.104
that, you know,
when you're rich, it's hard,

09:43.147 --> 09:44.975
and, oh, my God, and--

09:45.019 --> 09:46.455
No.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.935
It's so weird.
It's so easy for me.

09:47.978 --> 09:50.198
I just touch things,

09:50.241 --> 09:52.156
and the money pours in.
- Wow.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.984
- Sometimes I don't even have
to touch them all the way.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.073
I just kind of have to put
the tip in a little bit.

09:56.117 --> 09:57.988
- Okay. All right.
I'm gonna get the check.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.511
- Oh, no, don't get the check.
No, no.

09:59.555 --> 10:01.383
This is gonna blow you away.
- Oh.

10:01.426 --> 10:02.645
- 59.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.255
- Yeah, you're 59.

10:04.299 --> 10:06.214
- No, you would, like, think--
[chuckles]

10:06.257 --> 10:07.998
No, you would think
I was, like--

10:08.042 --> 10:09.521
I heard you're funny.
That's why you did that.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.567
You're funny,
and funny is good.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.569
I think funny
for women is great,

10:13.613 --> 10:16.224
'cause sometimes not all women
don't all--have it all.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.834
Okay, meanwhile...

10:17.878 --> 10:19.662
Okay, let me explain
something to you, okay?

10:19.706 --> 10:22.665
That's 29. I guarantee if we
called her over, she's 29.

10:22.709 --> 10:24.624
I could hit that
in a heartbeat.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.234
Honey?
Want me to show you?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.539
- No, I don't want--

10:27.583 --> 10:29.063
- No, just as, like,
a clinical--

10:29.106 --> 10:30.891
- While I'm here
having a meal with you?

10:30.934 --> 10:33.023
- Yes. No, no.
By the way, I'm here with you.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.244
I could have that,
but I have actually chosen--

10:36.287 --> 10:38.463
- Oh, my God.
- No, I want you to feel good.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.943
- No, no, I've chosen--

10:39.987 --> 10:41.771
I'm not getting up now
and going there.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.294
No, no, you're not getting this.
This is a compliment.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.687
- Thank you?
- And I am here with you.

10:44.731 --> 10:46.558
I'm sorry.
We got off track.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.125
So I like to work out.
- Yes, yes, you told me that.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.779
I can see that.
- Excuse me. Ms. Cole?

10:49.823 --> 10:51.999
Um, this just arrived
from Julianne Moore.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.696
- Oh, Jesus.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.003
- Hi, thanks for coming.
I'm Donny, by the way.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.657
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is...

10:57.700 --> 10:58.745
- Staci.
- Staci, Staci.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.877
- You're so friendly, Donny.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.879
I'm having fun.
This is a fun date.

11:02.923 --> 11:04.489
- But you know what happens
a lot of times in restaurants?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.056
I kind of wait
to sense it,

11:06.100 --> 11:07.667
'cause people know
about my body and stuff,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.277
and sometimes people
are expecting me to...

11:09.320 --> 11:10.713
get a little
more comfortable.

11:10.757 --> 11:12.497
- Oh, my God.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.499
You're not taking your shirt off
in a restaurant, right?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.719
- No, the undergarment
is still on, but this is...

11:16.763 --> 11:18.373
- Look at you.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.157
- You know, when you're
in the public eye

11:20.201 --> 11:21.768
and you start morphing
into what people expect--

11:21.811 --> 11:23.813
This is kind of something.
- That's amazing.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.902
I've never been
on a tank top date before.

11:25.946 --> 11:28.557
It's fun and whimsical
for all of us girls here.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.428
- It is. And sometimes
we go out dancing.

11:30.472 --> 11:32.735
- This is so fun,
just going on a date,

11:32.779 --> 11:34.476
just once of Staci's dates.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.217
- Right. Okay, one more thing.
- What?

11:36.260 --> 11:38.349
- Souvenir, souvenir for you.
Get your camera out.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.916
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.091
- What am I doing?
- Come on.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.093
This is for your friends,

11:43.137 --> 11:44.965
'cause they're never gonna
believe you went out with me.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.749
- I'm gonna put it in a frame
in my office.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.968
- [smooches]
[camera shutter clicks]

11:48.011 --> 11:49.796
- From our date.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.580
- [groaning]

11:51.623 --> 11:53.756
Mmm.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.932
[groaning]

11:55.976 --> 11:58.108
I'm thinking Jimmy
should get me a Jet Ski.

11:58.152 --> 12:01.198
- Jet Skis are boring.
What about a self-driving car?

12:01.242 --> 12:03.331
- Oh, yeah, those are cool.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.941
But if I run someone over
with it,

12:04.985 --> 12:06.595
who goes to jail--
me or the car?

12:06.638 --> 12:08.902
- The car.
- Awesome.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.556
- What's awesome?
- Todd is trying to figure out

12:11.600 --> 12:13.515
what to get from Jimmy
for his fat.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.343
- Um, I would hand him
a Sephora catalog

12:15.386 --> 12:17.562
and be like,
"One of everything, please."

12:17.606 --> 12:20.304
[grunting goofily]

12:20.348 --> 12:22.393
- I don't know what--
- Todd...

12:22.437 --> 12:25.309
I'm not sure about this whole
fat-transferring thing.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.789
What does your doctor say
about it?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.138
- I haven't talked
to any doctor.

12:28.182 --> 12:29.879
Jimmy tells me
I'll be fine.

12:29.923 --> 12:32.969
- No, Todd, you have to talk
to somebody about it.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.276
It's not a joke.
- I don't have a doctor.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.539
- Then you need to fine one.

12:37.582 --> 12:38.975
- Where do I find a doctor?

12:39.019 --> 12:41.369
Oh, yeah.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.632
I know a guy.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.982
[cheers and applause]

12:46.026 --> 12:49.377
- So what happens in menopause
is not only depletion

12:49.420 --> 12:51.814
of sex hormones like estrogen
and progesterone,

12:51.858 --> 12:53.381
but a compromised thyroid--

12:53.424 --> 12:55.949
- [grunts]
Oh, me.

12:55.992 --> 12:57.820
- I'm not taking questions
quite yet.

12:57.864 --> 13:01.302
All right, so some women
experience hot flashes.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.391
They get weight gain.
Then there's vaginal atrophy.

13:03.434 --> 13:06.002
- I'll be super quick, man.
[clears throat]

13:06.046 --> 13:07.395
- Where'd you get
that microphone from?

13:07.438 --> 13:09.005
- Oh, "Nightcap" next door.

13:09.049 --> 13:11.486
I work there. I'm, like,
best friends with Jimmy.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.053
- I'm trying to shoot
my show.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.576
- Oh, yeah, you're doing
a great job.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.796
You're killing it, man.
[chuckles]

13:16.839 --> 13:19.755
- [sighs]
What's the question?

13:19.799 --> 13:22.627
- Um, is donating fat
to another person dangerous?

13:22.671 --> 13:24.629
- We're talking
about menopause.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.718
What does that have to do
with menopause?

13:26.762 --> 13:29.025
- All right, uh,
if a 50-year-old lady

13:29.069 --> 13:31.854
donates her fat
to another 50-year-old lady,

13:31.898 --> 13:33.508
is that dangerous?

13:33.551 --> 13:35.031
- Yeah, it's dangerous.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.033
You can get vein clots
in your legs.

13:37.077 --> 13:38.556
They can fly up to your lungs.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.297
It's called
a pulmonary embolism.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.343
You can die from that.
That's not a good idea.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.431
- What?
- Yeah.

13:43.474 --> 13:45.563
- No, I don't want to die.

13:45.607 --> 13:48.262
All right, I'm gonna tell Jimmy
I'm not gonna do the surgery.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.046
Hey, thanks, Dr. Oz.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.570
You know what? You truly are
a wonderful wizard.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.355
Okay, I got to get
back to work.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.226
Sorry about that.
Excuse me. Sorry about that.

13:56.270 --> 13:58.838
- I thought
we had security here.

14:01.971 --> 14:05.148
[lively trumpet music]

14:11.763 --> 14:13.940
- Are you ready for your
gun safety test results?

14:15.942 --> 14:19.815
[gum balls clattering]

14:22.209 --> 14:23.993
Question one...

14:24.037 --> 14:25.821
When handling firearms,

14:25.865 --> 14:28.389
always assume every firearm
to be loaded.

14:28.432 --> 14:32.610
You wrote, "No, look down the
barrel and see what's what."

14:32.654 --> 14:35.004
- Oh, I also should've put,

14:35.048 --> 14:37.615
"You can shine a light
down there, too."

14:37.659 --> 14:39.095
My bad.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.925
-Question two:

14:42.969 --> 14:45.014
"It is okay to be reckless
with your firearm

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
"as long as you know
how to handle it

14:47.147 --> 14:48.844
and feel confident
using it."

14:48.888 --> 14:50.411
You just drew
a picture of yourself

14:50.454 --> 14:52.065
shooting two Uzis
in the air.

14:52.108 --> 14:54.328
- Yeah, but look how confident
my face is.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.417
- You didn't get
any of these correct,

14:56.460 --> 14:58.114
not a single one.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.463
You didn't even fill in
your name correctly.

14:59.507 --> 15:02.031
- Sometimes I spell it
F-I-L-L,

15:02.075 --> 15:03.685
'cause it's whimsical.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.948
- Please look in
to additional security cameras.

15:05.992 --> 15:08.516
Think about
a metal detector.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.648
Hell, I'll even take a moat
at this point.

15:10.692 --> 15:13.042
But whatever you do,
forget about getting a gun.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.739
Do you understand?

15:14.783 --> 15:17.438
- Jeez, you anti-gun nuts
are so intense.

15:17.481 --> 15:19.440
Here...

15:19.483 --> 15:22.182
take some chewy balls.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.880
They taste great,
and they never dissolve.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.362
[chewing loudly]

15:30.407 --> 15:32.670
- Okay, guys, I don't usually
like to reveal myself

15:32.714 --> 15:34.150
so early in the process,

15:34.194 --> 15:36.065
but I think
that I have something

15:36.109 --> 15:37.980
with this Staci character,
but I need your honest feedback.

15:38.024 --> 15:41.244
Okay? Just be--please, please,
completely honest.

15:41.288 --> 15:42.680
- Totally.
- Okay. All right.

15:42.724 --> 15:43.768
Um...
[clears throat]

15:43.812 --> 15:46.467
This is a phone, okay?

15:46.510 --> 15:48.077
Okay.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.471
Karen, you got to get me
Matt Damon.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.039
[sighs] You got to be
fucking kidding me.

15:53.082 --> 15:55.302
You got to be
fucking kidding me!

15:55.345 --> 15:56.999
- Yes.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.479
- No, no, Karen, please, please.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.002
No, no, I'm--
no, I understand.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.700
I totally understand,
but listen, Karen...

16:02.744 --> 16:04.964
[whispering]
See, the show is my life.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.096
- Kerry, I have to talk to you
about your set.

16:07.140 --> 16:08.924
- Sure, sure,
but check this out.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.926
Julianne Moore is work-shopping
a new character--

16:10.970 --> 16:12.754
some crazy woman
that works here, I guess.

16:12.797 --> 16:14.060
- You can't?
You really can't?

16:14.103 --> 16:15.278
Maybe next time?

16:15.322 --> 16:18.542
[groans]
Okay, bye.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.109
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.589
- That was...

16:21.632 --> 16:23.852
[applause]

16:23.895 --> 16:25.419
- Ridiculous.
- I thought so.

16:25.462 --> 16:27.725
I thought I had it, but...
- I mean...

16:27.769 --> 16:29.727
when you put
the effortless beauty aside,

16:29.771 --> 16:31.991
it really felt like Staci.
- Yeah.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.905
- Okay. All right.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.690
Okay, Julianne Moore, I need
to speak to you right now.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.605

- Why you look
so pale and weak?

16:57.581 --> 17:01.716
- Well, the weak part is because
my body doesn't make muscle.

- No, fool.
Why weak like sad?

17:04.327 --> 17:08.157

I'm doing a bad job in security.

they won't let me have a gun.

That's the end of my movie--

- No, no, no.

This is not a mental breakdown.
