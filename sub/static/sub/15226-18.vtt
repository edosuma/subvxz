01:23.115 --> 01:26.818
Have I ever told you guys
  anything about Fred Collins?

01:26.852 --> 01:29.354
He's got bedroom eyes,

01:29.388 --> 01:32.524
David Niven mustache

01:32.558 --> 01:36.027
and eyes that show you that
    he's a little boy after all.

01:36.061 --> 01:39.563
(giggles)
             ALEX:
You just happened to mention him
          in passing?

01:39.598 --> 01:41.766
Well, I'm seeing him tonight.
              No!

01:41.800 --> 01:43.835
Hey, you finally got a
         date with the guy, huh?

01:43.837 --> 01:45.470
Uh, well, no, not exactly,

01:45.504 --> 01:47.105
but I did find out
        that he's going

01:47.139 --> 01:49.374
to the Japanese Costume Show
      at the Metropolitan.

01:49.408 --> 01:51.776
Oh?
It's the cultural
event of the year.
                        Wow.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.445
And, uh, I just happened
  to get myself invited along,

01:54.480 --> 01:57.048
and I'm gonna be sitting next
to him at the dinner afterwards.
                        Yeah!

01:57.183 --> 01:58.850
You got it, you got it.
              ELAINE (giggling):
                     Yeah.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.751
And if that doesn't work,
   I'll try something subtle

02:00.786 --> 02:02.586
like the
   Dance of the Seven Veils.

02:02.621 --> 02:03.354
(laughs)

02:03.489 --> 02:04.589
Don't worry, Elaine,

02:04.623 --> 02:06.123
it's gonna work;
        you're a knockout, baby.

02:06.158 --> 02:07.559
Oh, I hope so.

02:07.593 --> 02:10.228
I just want everything to be
so perfect tonight, you know?

02:10.262 --> 02:12.730
So, that's why I did this.

02:15.434 --> 02:17.869
Nice outfit.
                        Not bad.

02:17.904 --> 02:19.404
You mean, you can't
    tell the difference?

02:19.438 --> 02:20.605
ALEX:
Hmm?

02:20.639 --> 02:21.739
Oh, no!

02:21.841 --> 02:24.742
I spent $25 on this hairdo.

02:26.011 --> 02:27.679
Oh, my God, you're right.

02:27.713 --> 02:29.647
It's not special enough.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.516
I'm gonna have to do it.

02:31.550 --> 02:34.719
One of these days, I'm gonna
 have to go to Vincenzo Seneca.

02:34.721 --> 02:38.156
That's that place with the
   great nude beaches, right?

02:38.191 --> 02:42.527
Yeah, but they got
               spiders this big.

02:42.561 --> 02:43.962
No.

02:43.996 --> 02:47.499
Vincenzo Seneca is the "in"
 hair stylist of New York City.

02:47.533 --> 02:49.200
Oh, you'll always see
    the most gorgeous women

02:49.235 --> 02:50.402
leaving his salon.

02:50.436 --> 02:51.836
Yeah.

02:51.870 --> 02:53.704
You know, there's no harm
           in trying

02:53.739 --> 02:56.007
to get an appointment today,
             right?

02:56.041 --> 02:57.708
I mean, why not?

02:57.743 --> 02:59.377
Sure.

02:59.412 --> 03:04.549
You know, I've always wanted
         to have my hair styled.

03:04.584 --> 03:08.653
I need a little help in
          this one problem area.

03:08.687 --> 03:09.955
Cowlick?

03:09.989 --> 03:13.758
I'll try anything.

03:13.792 --> 03:15.126
Elaine, I don't
      want to say nothing,

03:15.160 --> 03:17.361
but this guy sounds
       pretty expensive.

03:17.396 --> 03:19.530
Uh-huh, it could cost me
          maybe $100.

03:19.532 --> 03:20.298
Ouch!

03:20.399 --> 03:21.299
Mm.
    Hmm.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.400
Deal.

03:23.802 --> 03:25.336
LOUIE:
   All right, gather around,
            cabbies,

03:25.404 --> 03:27.505
Gather around.

03:27.539 --> 03:28.806
Come, come, come, come, come!

03:33.546 --> 03:36.814
We have a morale problem here.

03:36.849 --> 03:38.482
You guys are always complaining

03:38.517 --> 03:40.351
that you're bored,

03:40.386 --> 03:43.621
that there's nothing to do
        in this garage.

03:43.656 --> 03:46.558
Well, now you've got
        something to do.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.362
Guess what's under here.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.964
Uh, is it a volleyball?

03:54.700 --> 03:56.300
Close.

03:56.335 --> 03:59.337
Allow me to present...

03:59.371 --> 04:01.305
Pac-Man!

04:08.281 --> 04:11.348
Now, who is gonna be
         the lucky pup

04:11.383 --> 04:13.384
who gets to play the first game?

04:20.493 --> 04:22.727
Iggy!

04:22.762 --> 04:24.996
You're a somewhat
    compulsive personality.

04:25.831 --> 04:27.799
Step forward.

04:29.735 --> 04:33.571
Now... you see,
       there's the maze.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.906
Uh-huh.
           All right.

04:34.940 --> 04:38.076
You see the little things
        inside the maze?

04:38.110 --> 04:39.277
They're dots.

04:39.311 --> 04:40.945
That's right!
    Oh!

04:40.979 --> 04:42.414
The dots!
    Ah!

04:42.416 --> 04:45.116
Iggy, you were born
                to play Pac-Man!

04:45.151 --> 04:47.118
Oh!
         Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:47.152 --> 04:49.454
Now, now the object
                     of the game
        Uh-huh.

04:49.488 --> 04:54.258
is to move that little yellow
   circle around with this stick

04:54.293 --> 04:56.461
and eat up all the dots.

04:56.495 --> 04:58.062
Oh, wow!
                (chuckling)

04:58.097 --> 05:00.131
No, no, no, no, Iggy, Iggy,

05:00.165 --> 05:01.866
settle down, settle
              down, settle down.

05:01.900 --> 05:05.270
There's more.
     More?!

05:05.304 --> 05:07.271
Now, you see those, those
    monsters in the middle?

05:07.305 --> 05:08.572
Uh-huh.
              All right,

05:08.607 --> 05:09.940
they come out...
Yeah?

05:09.975 --> 05:11.275
and try and eat you.

05:11.344 --> 05:12.410
Whoa!

05:13.346 --> 05:15.279
All right,
         Iggy, Iggy...

05:15.314 --> 05:17.148
Oh, come on,
please, boss!

05:17.182 --> 05:19.150
There's more, Iggy,
             there's more!

05:19.185 --> 05:20.385
More!
       More?!

05:20.419 --> 05:21.552
Yes, yes.

05:21.586 --> 05:22.854
More.
                 All right, now,

05:22.888 --> 05:24.789
you see those
     white things flashing?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.558
Uh-huh.
     Well, those are energizers.

05:26.592 --> 05:27.892
Yeah?
                 Yes.

05:27.927 --> 05:29.861
If you eat one of those,

05:29.895 --> 05:33.498
then the monsters turn blue

05:33.532 --> 05:35.667
and then when you eat them,

05:35.701 --> 05:37.769
you get points
            for eating them.

05:37.803 --> 05:39.970
Oh, oh!

05:40.005 --> 05:41.373
Iggy, Iggy, are you ready?

05:41.407 --> 05:43.040
Oh, I'm ready, boss!

05:43.075 --> 05:44.975
All right, all right,
                all right, whoa!

05:45.044 --> 05:46.878
I... I love
          his enthusiasm.

05:46.912 --> 05:48.847
Iggy, Iggy, okay.

05:48.881 --> 05:50.281
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh!

05:50.315 --> 05:52.550
The first one is on me.

05:52.585 --> 05:54.586
Ah...

05:54.620 --> 05:55.920
Now remember...

05:55.954 --> 05:57.088
Uh-huh.

05:57.122 --> 05:59.090
You only get
           three chances.

05:59.124 --> 06:02.059
(Pac-Man game intro music plays)

06:04.597 --> 06:07.165
(beeping, laser beam-like
     life-loss music plays)

06:07.199 --> 06:10.468
(life-loss music plays twice)

06:13.406 --> 06:14.839
Is it over?

06:14.874 --> 06:16.107
Yeah.

06:16.141 --> 06:17.876
That was the greatest
              thrill of my life!

06:17.910 --> 06:19.377
I'm glad you liked it!

06:19.412 --> 06:20.879
(yelling in exhilaration)

06:22.248 --> 06:23.981
All right, Iggy,
go to it, Iggy.
                    Ah. Oh.

06:26.518 --> 06:28.286
Guys, oh, I cannot believe this!

06:28.320 --> 06:29.454
Do you know what?

06:29.488 --> 06:31.322
There was a cancellation
just a few minutes ago.

06:31.356 --> 06:33.357
I can see Vincenzo Seneca
this afternoon.

06:33.426 --> 06:35.093
Hey, go, go, go!

06:35.127 --> 06:37.262
Now all I have to do
is cancel it.

06:37.296 --> 06:39.397
I can't afford this.

06:39.431 --> 06:41.099
Of course I can afford this.

06:41.133 --> 06:43.301
This may be one of the
   biggest nights of my life,

06:43.335 --> 06:44.903
and money is no object.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.604
Money has to be an object.
         I'm a cabbie.

06:46.638 --> 06:49.107
I am not an extravagant person.

06:49.141 --> 06:51.375
But I am entitled
    to an extravagant fling

06:51.409 --> 06:54.078
now and then, and this is it.

06:54.113 --> 06:55.813
This is it.

06:55.847 --> 06:57.982
I'm going.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.150
Oh, I'm going.

07:00.185 --> 07:01.886
ELAINE:
           <i>I'm going.</i>

07:09.661 --> 07:11.662
Excuse me, I'm
                   Elaine Nardo.

07:11.696 --> 07:15.133
Hello, your appointment
is with?

07:15.167 --> 07:16.300
Vincenzo.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.436
Let me see if there's
been a cancellation.

07:18.470 --> 07:20.538
Oh, no, no, no, I
            have an appointment.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.708
Yes, but he sometimes cancels.

07:23.742 --> 07:24.909
Creative people.

07:24.943 --> 07:26.678
No, no,

07:26.712 --> 07:28.279
everything seems to be fine,

07:28.313 --> 07:30.148
but he is running
just a little bit late.

07:30.182 --> 07:31.415
Oh, that's okay.

07:31.449 --> 07:33.851
I can wait.

07:33.885 --> 07:35.386
Um...

07:35.421 --> 07:37.721
I've never been here before,

07:37.756 --> 07:40.424
and, uh, I really don't know
     what Vincenzo charges.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.293
So, could you tell me?

07:42.327 --> 07:43.661
Not that it matters, of course.

07:43.696 --> 07:47.031
$225 for a Seneca design.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.500
Is that too much?

07:48.534 --> 07:52.102
(uneasy laugh)
              No.

07:52.137 --> 07:55.139
No, it's very reasonable.

07:55.174 --> 07:56.907
What else are you
      interested in today?

07:56.942 --> 07:58.276
Eyelash tint?

07:58.310 --> 07:59.277
No.

07:59.311 --> 08:01.112
Wax?
                       No.

08:01.146 --> 08:02.413
Facial?

08:02.448 --> 08:03.181
No.

08:03.215 --> 08:04.348
A manicure?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.084
No.
No?

08:06.118 --> 08:08.986
You're quite sure?

08:09.021 --> 08:11.722
Yes, I'm quite sure.

08:11.724 --> 08:14.291
Well, while you're waiting,
you may have some wine

08:14.326 --> 08:15.626
or coffee or...?

08:15.660 --> 08:16.995
Oh, no thanks.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.097
Rebecca, Miss Rydell
     is dry; comb her out.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.032
Lamont, clean that up
back there, will you?

08:21.066 --> 08:22.734
Mike, not too much
off the back.

08:22.835 --> 08:24.135
CLIENT:
      Oh... oh, Vincenzo,

08:24.169 --> 08:25.669
I wanted to look marvelous

08:25.704 --> 08:27.438
at the Japanese opening
              at the Met tonight

08:27.472 --> 08:29.340
and you've really done it.

08:29.374 --> 08:30.775
Oh, how can I thank you?

08:30.809 --> 08:32.443
Bring me a kimono.

08:32.477 --> 08:36.313
Oh, oh, I would, but I think
    there'll be security guards.

08:36.347 --> 08:37.948
Then bring me a security guard.

08:37.982 --> 08:40.317
Oh!
    (chuckling)

08:40.385 --> 08:42.152
(giggling)

08:46.425 --> 08:47.791
Is my 1:00 here yet?

08:47.826 --> 08:49.160
Mm, yes, Vincenzo.

08:49.194 --> 08:51.328
Hi, I'm Elaine.

08:51.363 --> 08:53.130
Hello.
                          Hello.

08:53.165 --> 08:54.531
Well, let's see what we've got.

08:57.769 --> 09:00.605
I'm also going to the Japanese
Costume Show at the Met,

09:00.639 --> 09:02.339
and I'd love to look
fantastic, too.

09:02.374 --> 09:03.942
Mm-hmm.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.411
Do you usually
             cut this yourself?

09:06.445 --> 09:07.779
No.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.781
Oh, well, never mind,
              just hop up there.

09:11.516 --> 09:13.751
Now...

09:13.785 --> 09:15.386
Elaine,

09:15.421 --> 09:17.655
just as Michelangelo

09:17.690 --> 09:21.025
discovered the beauty of
      David in a slab of marble,

09:21.059 --> 09:23.728
I shall find in that head of
    hair your perfect hairstyle.

09:23.796 --> 09:25.963
Promise.
   (giggling):
      Okay.

09:25.997 --> 09:27.932
But who's gonna dress you?

09:27.967 --> 09:30.701
(chortles)

09:30.769 --> 09:34.505
So, what are we going
               to do today, hmm?

09:34.539 --> 09:35.940
I don't know.

09:35.974 --> 09:37.508
Well, why don't you tell me
       something about yourself?

09:37.542 --> 09:38.943
Maybe that'll help.

09:38.977 --> 09:40.411
Well, um...

09:40.445 --> 09:43.547
I'm a mother and I also
     drive a cab part-time

09:43.581 --> 09:45.616
and I work at an art gallery
           part-time

09:45.651 --> 09:47.985
and I'm gonna have the biggest
    night I've had in years

09:48.019 --> 09:49.953
and I want to look great.

09:49.989 --> 09:51.922
Cabdriver, really?
Mm-hmm.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.658
How fascinating.

09:53.692 --> 09:56.628
Well, stick with me,
 and you'll become a passenger.

09:56.662 --> 10:00.098
How about just
     an edge of style, hmm?

10:00.132 --> 10:01.699
Okay.
             Oh, I know, I know.

10:01.733 --> 10:04.635
Uh, just a hint of color?

10:04.669 --> 10:06.371
Oh, Vincenzo, I don't know.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.272
I'm pretty comfortable
with this color.

10:08.340 --> 10:09.641
Well, all right, fine.

10:09.675 --> 10:11.075
We'll stick with <i>I Love Lucy.</i>

10:11.109 --> 10:12.376
Wait.

10:12.410 --> 10:14.912
Uh, Vincenzo, I don't mean
   to offend you or anything.

10:14.946 --> 10:18.082
It's just that it's so important
  to me to look great tonight,

10:18.116 --> 10:19.951
and, and I really don't know
          what I want,

10:20.019 --> 10:21.352
so I'm just a little nervous.

10:21.386 --> 10:23.487
I think you should
        leave it to me.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.356
I don't know,
   what would you want to...

10:25.391 --> 10:26.957
I think you should
        leave it to me.

10:26.991 --> 10:28.292
But you don't
really know me.

10:28.327 --> 10:30.761
You want thick,
             you want beautiful,

10:30.829 --> 10:33.096
you want men to drop dead
       at the very sight of you.

10:33.131 --> 10:35.299
Am I right?
   Exactly.

10:35.334 --> 10:38.202
I think you should
                 leave it to me.

10:39.238 --> 10:40.804
Hmm?

10:40.839 --> 10:44.007
Well...
okay, I'll trust you.

10:44.042 --> 10:45.910
You won't be
                   disappointed.

10:46.011 --> 10:48.712
Rebecca, we're gonna need
            some green out here.

10:48.746 --> 10:50.114
Just kidding.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.782
Just kidding!

10:56.522 --> 10:58.489
ELAINE:
      You know, it's gonna
    be a marvelous evening.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.125
This man is so divine,
   Vincenzo, you'd love him.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.393
Can I look now?

11:02.427 --> 11:04.162
No, no, no, no,
not yet, not yet.

11:04.196 --> 11:06.330
Oh, my God,
you're gonna love this.

11:06.365 --> 11:07.998
Really?
It's absolutely perfect.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.300
I hope so.

11:09.334 --> 11:10.768
I'm so nervous,
        I can't breathe.

11:10.802 --> 11:12.170
Are you ready?
                Yeah.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.437
Hmm?
                Okay.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.410
(screams)

11:20.478 --> 11:21.913
Too fabulous
                        for you?

11:21.947 --> 11:24.948
Oh, what did you do?

11:24.983 --> 11:26.850
What did you do to my hair?!

11:26.919 --> 11:28.486
You're not unhappy,
                        are you?

11:28.520 --> 11:30.254
Oh! I knew it!
           I knew it!

11:30.288 --> 11:32.523
I should've looked! No!

11:32.558 --> 11:34.892
Listen, you're just upset
  because it's something new.

11:34.926 --> 11:38.462
Believe me, live with it for
  a while, and you'll love it.

11:38.497 --> 11:40.330
All right, fine,
   don't take my word for it.

11:40.365 --> 11:42.366
People, come around here,
       will you, please?

11:42.401 --> 11:46.637
Now, Elaine isn't quite sure
        about her hair.

11:46.671 --> 11:49.407
Personally, I think
            it's tremendous.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.743
Now, we'd like
            some other opinions.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.043
It's fantastic!
                      Beautiful!
        Gorgeous!

11:53.077 --> 11:55.078
It should go
                    in the book!

11:55.114 --> 11:56.814
Right.

11:56.848 --> 11:58.049
Let me get out of here.

11:58.083 --> 12:00.518
I just want to get out of here.

12:00.552 --> 12:04.655
Well, I guess I just
      can't do cabdrivers.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.367
You're kidding me.

12:16.401 --> 12:18.235
Well, what did you
expect me to say?

12:18.303 --> 12:20.071
(Pac-Man game whirring
          and beeping)

12:20.105 --> 12:23.074
Hey, Jim.

12:23.108 --> 12:26.077
Have you been at that machine
        all day nonstop?

12:26.111 --> 12:28.079
No.

12:28.113 --> 12:30.081
I had to go out
               a couple of times

12:30.115 --> 12:32.049
and beg for quarters.

12:33.952 --> 12:35.686
All right,

12:35.720 --> 12:38.488
paychecks, paychecks, everybody.

12:38.490 --> 12:41.292
Badick...

12:41.326 --> 12:42.793
Banta...
        All right, Lou.

12:42.828 --> 12:43.760
Reiger.

12:45.197 --> 12:46.297
Ignatowski!

12:46.331 --> 12:47.698
(coins clinking)

12:49.768 --> 12:52.570
Thanks, boss.
                 You're a brick.

12:52.604 --> 12:54.872
Ha ha. (mimics Pac-Man game
sounds): Mm, yum, yum, yum.

12:54.906 --> 12:56.740
Yum, yum, yum, yum.
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

12:56.774 --> 12:58.042
Ha ha!

13:00.178 --> 13:01.478
You know, you're
                    sick, Louie.

13:01.512 --> 13:02.980
You know that?

13:03.014 --> 13:05.782
Hey, Jim, come on.

13:05.817 --> 13:07.852
For a guy like you, this
can become an obsession,

13:07.886 --> 13:09.686
you know that?
              (game music plays)

13:09.721 --> 13:12.055
Why don't you quit before
you've spent all your money?

13:12.090 --> 13:13.891
Don't let this
happen to you, Jim.

13:13.925 --> 13:16.794
Lighten up.

13:16.828 --> 13:20.198
(crying)

13:20.232 --> 13:21.898
Elaine?

13:21.933 --> 13:23.501
Oh, my God, Elaine!

13:23.535 --> 13:24.835
(crying)

13:24.870 --> 13:26.304
Elaine, hey, no,
                     no, no, no.

13:26.338 --> 13:27.704
Wait, Elaine,
              it's not that bad.

13:27.739 --> 13:28.739
Stop crying.

13:28.773 --> 13:30.708
No.
Who's crying?

13:30.742 --> 13:32.743
Oh, Elaine.

13:32.777 --> 13:34.178
I'm sorry.

13:34.213 --> 13:36.147
I was just looking
at your lovely new hairdo.

13:36.181 --> 13:37.882
(crying):
   Oh, don't lie to me, Tony.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.816
It's hideous!
          It's awful!

13:39.885 --> 13:42.620
I wanted this to be
 the biggest night of my life,

13:42.688 --> 13:44.188
and now I can't even go.

13:44.222 --> 13:46.090
Oh, hey, now, come on,
don't say that.

13:46.092 --> 13:48.826
You-you should go
            anyway.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.595
Why? So they can serve
   hors d'oeuvres on my head?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.568
Why don't you
just get it fixed?

13:57.602 --> 13:58.735
I can't fix this!

13:58.770 --> 14:01.738
I can't even get a comb
          through it.

14:01.773 --> 14:03.740
Once you do this much
         to your hair,

14:03.775 --> 14:06.544
you have to leave it alone
     for a couple of days.

14:06.578 --> 14:09.212
And if I do anything now,
 it'll just fall out in clumps.

14:09.248 --> 14:10.548
It might be worth a shot.

14:10.582 --> 14:12.950
Tony!

14:12.952 --> 14:15.353
Look, Elaine,

14:15.387 --> 14:16.854
don't get depressed
by this.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.823
Oh, I'm not
                  even depressed
                 about it, Alex.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.858
I'm furious!
         I'm so angry!

14:20.893 --> 14:22.360
I'm so mad at that guy!

14:22.394 --> 14:24.195
I'm so mad at myself!

14:24.229 --> 14:25.529
Don't you see, I could have...

14:25.563 --> 14:26.997
I could have asked him

14:27.031 --> 14:29.166
to show me what he was doing
  in the mirror, but I didn't.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.035
I just let him intimidate me.

14:31.069 --> 14:33.304
I tried to act like
    I was part of his world.

14:33.338 --> 14:34.972
I-I denied who I am.

14:35.007 --> 14:36.573
I didn't listen to my instincts.

14:36.608 --> 14:37.574
I knew it!

14:37.609 --> 14:39.243
I knew it
    as I was sitting there.

14:39.278 --> 14:40.278
So what did I do?

14:40.312 --> 14:42.280
I just emptied my wallet
        and paid the guy

14:42.314 --> 14:45.783
for making me look
     like spoiled coleslaw.

14:45.817 --> 14:47.618
Oh, oh, Elaine, Elaine,
        Elaine, Elaine,

14:47.652 --> 14:49.286
no, no, no, no, no,
        please, please.

14:49.321 --> 14:52.289
Hey, Elaine,
what's going on?

14:53.325 --> 14:55.826
Wait... a minute.

14:55.861 --> 14:57.828
There's something
different about you.

14:57.863 --> 14:59.830
Jim...
Don't tell me.

14:59.865 --> 15:01.832
Uh, wait a minute,
it's your hair.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.100
Isn't it?
Isn't it?

15:03.168 --> 15:04.401
Yes!

15:04.469 --> 15:05.135
Hey.

15:06.271 --> 15:08.239
They always
appreciate it

15:08.273 --> 15:10.574
when you notice
the little things.

15:12.611 --> 15:15.245
You know, look
                 at it this way.

15:15.279 --> 15:17.247
At least the worst
            is over.

15:17.281 --> 15:20.217
Louie isn't here,
is he?

15:21.419 --> 15:23.487
Correction.
   The worst is yet to come.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.389
ALEX:
            Louie, Louie, Louie!

15:26.891 --> 15:28.826
Louie, no.

15:31.897 --> 15:33.798
Louie, Louie.

15:33.832 --> 15:36.801
I haven't seen a mess
          like that...

15:36.835 --> 15:38.969
since somebody stuck
         a firecracker

15:39.003 --> 15:41.572
up my Uncle Emilio's parrot.

15:43.775 --> 15:46.610
Louie, she feels bad enough

15:46.645 --> 15:49.613
without having to put up
    with those insults of yours.

15:49.647 --> 15:50.814
What insults?

15:50.849 --> 15:53.350
I loved that bird.

15:53.385 --> 15:55.519
Ah, gee-whiz, Nardo.

15:55.553 --> 15:57.521
Gee-whiz!

15:57.555 --> 15:59.523
(sobbing)
                          Louie.

15:59.557 --> 16:01.525
Gee-whiz, Nardo.

16:01.559 --> 16:03.027
Why'd you do it?

16:03.061 --> 16:05.496
I mean, I...

16:05.530 --> 16:08.098
Well, I guess you got a right
   to feel self-destructive,

16:08.133 --> 16:09.567
but you could've thought of me.

16:11.003 --> 16:13.337
I look forward to seeing you
           every day,

16:13.371 --> 16:16.907
like some palookas look forward
         to a sunrise.

16:16.941 --> 16:18.709
Well, wh-why'd you do it?

16:18.743 --> 16:21.679
Uh, were you feeling
that self-destructive?

16:23.715 --> 16:26.683
Is this a twisted cry
for help?

16:27.819 --> 16:30.087
TONY:
  Louie, she didn't want this.

16:30.121 --> 16:32.189
Some fancy hairdresser
                  did it to her.

16:32.257 --> 16:33.657
Yeah.
Is that true?

16:33.691 --> 16:34.658
Yeah.

16:34.692 --> 16:36.660
Oh, geez!

16:36.694 --> 16:38.429
Oh!

16:38.463 --> 16:40.364
Oh!
                     Just forget
                   about it now.

16:40.399 --> 16:41.832
There's nothing I can do
           about it.

16:43.668 --> 16:44.902
Wh-What-What
                    do you mean?

16:44.936 --> 16:46.169
Wh-What do you mean,
             there's nothing...?

16:46.204 --> 16:47.772
There's gotta
                be something
                she can do.

16:47.839 --> 16:52.176
I mean, if a man assaulted
   her body, he'd go to jail.

16:52.210 --> 16:54.745
If a man desecrated
                 a work of art--

16:54.779 --> 16:56.413
in the clink.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.682
Maybe I should go over there
   and break that guy's head.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.684
Now that's something!
      An act of barbarism.

17:00.718 --> 17:01.618
Yeah!
Wait a minute.

17:01.652 --> 17:03.287
Wait a minute here.

17:03.321 --> 17:04.954
Don't be ridiculous, Tony.

17:04.989 --> 17:06.357
You are a professional boxer.

17:06.391 --> 17:08.059
You just can't go around....
Reiger,

17:08.093 --> 17:09.259
you've seen his fights.

17:09.294 --> 17:11.796
There's not a court in the land
    that would buy that one.

17:13.865 --> 17:15.198
Don't listen to him.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.465
Even you can take
a hairdresser.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.734
Was he big?

17:17.769 --> 17:18.702
ALEX:
              Hey, now, come on,
                      everybody.

17:18.737 --> 17:20.637
Now, just calm down,
                 just calm down.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.906
So he gave her
                  a bad haircut.

17:22.941 --> 17:24.608
That doesn't make him a bad guy,
            does it?

17:24.642 --> 17:26.476
He treated me like dirt.

17:26.511 --> 17:29.146
When I was leaving there crying,
           he said...

17:29.180 --> 17:31.415
"Well, I guess
    I can't do cabdrivers."

17:31.449 --> 17:33.383
Oh, he kills me. He kills me.
Yeah, and then...

17:33.452 --> 17:36.253
and then all the people in the
shop started to laugh at me.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.255
LOUIE:
        Ooh, dirty rat.
                What did you do?

17:38.290 --> 17:39.590
Nothing.

17:39.624 --> 17:40.824
What could I do?

17:40.858 --> 17:43.627
Since when do you
          take things like that?

17:43.661 --> 17:45.328
You could have asked
            for your money back.

17:45.363 --> 17:47.331
You could have demanded
                that he redo it.

17:47.365 --> 17:48.832
You could have
                   gotten angry.

17:48.867 --> 17:50.601
I mean, wh-what is
                this guy anyway?

17:50.635 --> 17:51.935
I mean, just...
Will you give me
a break?

17:51.969 --> 17:53.470
I just want to forget it now.
Forget it?

17:53.505 --> 17:54.704
Forget it?
You can't forget it.

17:54.739 --> 17:55.705
How can you forget?

17:55.740 --> 17:56.873
Every time you look
in the mirror,

17:56.907 --> 17:59.876
every time you hear
the laughter of kids...

17:59.910 --> 18:02.679
every time a policeman's
horse shies up,

18:02.713 --> 18:03.947
how can you forget that?

18:03.982 --> 18:05.583
Elaine, look,

18:05.617 --> 18:07.317
you don't feel foolish
because of what he did to you.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.919
You feel foolish
because you took it, right?

18:08.953 --> 18:10.153
Because you took it.

18:10.188 --> 18:11.721
Now you gotta go back there,
you know that.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.124
No.
You gotta go back.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.858
No! Alex, Alex, you can't
          make me go back there.

18:14.892 --> 18:16.961
You don't know how
           mean they were to me.
Don't worry about it.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.762
I'll go with you.
Now where is it?

18:18.797 --> 18:20.498
53rd and Lex.

18:20.532 --> 18:21.565
Good. Come on.

18:21.599 --> 18:23.501
Come on.
                 Oh.

18:23.535 --> 18:26.503
53rd and Lex.

18:33.177 --> 18:34.377
Come on.

18:34.412 --> 18:36.046
Just do it.
      Get your money back.

18:36.080 --> 18:37.881
It'll take a couple
             of weeks, and it'll
                   be all right.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.850
No.

18:41.052 --> 18:43.053
Uh, hello.
                       I'm back.

18:43.087 --> 18:45.055
Oh, don't you worry, darling.

18:45.089 --> 18:46.456
I'll just tell him
   you're here to apologize.

18:46.490 --> 18:47.824
He'll understand.

18:47.859 --> 18:48.825
Thank you.
                       Let's go.
     Thank you?

18:48.860 --> 18:49.827
What're you
talking about?
                         Alex...

18:49.861 --> 18:52.196
Don't let these people
intimidate you.

18:52.230 --> 18:53.264
Alex, they're not
                intimidating me.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.765
I just want to go.
There is no reason...

18:54.799 --> 18:56.400
Can I borrow
your hand mirror?

18:56.434 --> 18:58.669
Alex, I want
                     to go home.

18:58.671 --> 19:01.472
I want to talk
                     to Vincenzo
                      right now!

19:01.506 --> 19:03.641
Right now.

19:03.675 --> 19:06.443
He can't be disturbed
     when he's in comb-out.

19:06.477 --> 19:07.978
Well, if he can't be disturbed
while he's in comb-out,

19:08.012 --> 19:09.079
we'll wait.

19:09.181 --> 19:11.015
Would you like some wine
        while you wait?

19:11.049 --> 19:11.949
Is it free?

19:12.050 --> 19:13.950
Yes, of course.
             Okay.

19:18.322 --> 19:20.123
You come here often?

19:20.158 --> 19:22.893
I'm just here waiting
      for a cancellation.

19:24.896 --> 19:27.298
Uh, listen,
        I'm Alex Reiger.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.532
I work with Elaine.

19:28.600 --> 19:29.699
Oh, my God!

19:29.734 --> 19:32.102
The fleet's in.

19:33.038 --> 19:35.839
Vincenzo, I am very upset

19:35.873 --> 19:37.508
about what you did
to my hair.

19:37.542 --> 19:40.010
I-I-I'm ashamed
to be seen in public,

19:40.045 --> 19:42.246
and I feel like you
           bullied me into this.

19:42.280 --> 19:45.082
I'd like you
to give me my money back,

19:45.116 --> 19:47.084
and I also think
you owe me an apology

19:47.118 --> 19:48.518
for the way
you talked to me.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.889
Where do you come from that you
  think life works like that?

19:51.923 --> 19:53.057
My God.

19:53.091 --> 19:55.225
Hey, now wait a minute,
             buddy, buddy,

19:55.260 --> 19:56.894
now either you give her
               her money back...

19:56.995 --> 19:57.995
Or what?

19:58.029 --> 19:59.997
Are you gonna
create a scene?

20:00.031 --> 20:02.333
Do you really think
that I'm afraid of a scene?

20:02.367 --> 20:05.402
Girls, we're in luck.

20:05.436 --> 20:07.371
There's going to be a scene.

20:08.439 --> 20:10.073
Now...

20:10.107 --> 20:12.075
this young woman came
              to me this morning

20:12.109 --> 20:14.578
with a hairdo that her high
  school must have found boring,

20:14.580 --> 20:17.581
and I gave her this.

20:17.615 --> 20:19.716
Beautiful!

20:21.453 --> 20:23.186
Like a parrot.

20:26.625 --> 20:28.225
And instead of
                    thanking me,

20:28.259 --> 20:30.060
she brought the
           Jewish Defense League

20:30.095 --> 20:31.861
to get her money back.

20:31.896 --> 20:35.466
Hey, now, now wait a minute,
       now wait a minute.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.868
I-I don't belong
      to any organization.

20:37.902 --> 20:40.871
I happen to be
    a very simple cabdriver

20:40.905 --> 20:44.208
and a friend of Elaine and a...
     a champion of justice.

20:44.242 --> 20:45.876
ALEX:
Louie!

20:45.910 --> 20:47.244
What are you doing here?

20:47.278 --> 20:49.612
I want to see the guy
who did it.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.915
Louie, I don't want you
to say a word.

20:51.949 --> 20:53.250
Not a word.

20:53.284 --> 20:54.518
I mean it.

20:56.587 --> 20:58.555
All right, all right,
  all right, I won't say a word.

20:58.589 --> 20:59.722
I promise.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.257
I just want to see him.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.426
Is this

21:02.460 --> 21:06.063
the big date you were
getting ready for?

21:06.097 --> 21:07.865
(growling)

21:09.901 --> 21:11.835
Curb your friend,
will you please?

21:11.869 --> 21:14.505
Louie, Louie,
it's very important...

21:14.539 --> 21:16.440
it's very important that
Elaine handle this herself.

21:16.474 --> 21:17.674
Do you hear me?

21:17.709 --> 21:18.509
Now you just sit
down somewhere.

21:18.543 --> 21:19.510
Just sit down somewhere.
Come here.

21:19.544 --> 21:20.778
Sit down.
Here.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.012
Come on, sit.

21:22.046 --> 21:23.680
(growling)
  Sit! Sit!

21:23.715 --> 21:24.648
Sit!

21:28.186 --> 21:29.553
Stay! Stay!

21:29.587 --> 21:30.821
Stay!

21:35.626 --> 21:37.694
Young lady,
     what is your problem?

21:37.729 --> 21:39.562
I mean, when are you
         gonna realize

21:39.597 --> 21:43.334
that all of these people think
     that my work is great?

21:43.368 --> 21:46.402
You think you've got
   this big personality cult

21:46.437 --> 21:48.371
going here, don't you?

21:48.406 --> 21:49.639
Well, let me tell
                  you something.

21:49.673 --> 21:51.675
I bet there isn't
                    a woman here

21:51.709 --> 21:55.145
who doesn't know exactly
         what I'm talking about.

21:55.179 --> 21:57.380
Haven't you ever
           been terribly unhappy

21:57.415 --> 21:59.049
with-with what he's
              done to your hair,

21:59.083 --> 22:00.950
and yet you didn't want
          to say anything to him

22:00.985 --> 22:03.453
because you felt like
             it would upset him?

22:03.488 --> 22:05.022
Well...

22:05.056 --> 22:07.357
ELAINE:
             I mean, I came here
                   for something

22:07.392 --> 22:09.459
a little special, you know,
for something a little different

22:09.493 --> 22:11.495
and-and this is what I got.

22:11.529 --> 22:13.330
I mean, look at this.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.498
Look at me!

22:14.532 --> 22:16.667
Joan of Arc did less whining
         at the stake.

22:16.701 --> 22:18.802
(laughing):
            My God.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.838
ALEX:
                 Elaine, Elaine!

22:20.872 --> 22:21.772
Elaine!

22:21.873 --> 22:23.674
Look at me.
        What am I doing?

22:23.708 --> 22:25.475
What am I doing?

22:25.509 --> 22:26.543
Go ahead.

22:26.578 --> 22:29.079
Common people
    do common things.

22:29.113 --> 22:30.247
(grunts)
                           ALEX:
                         Elaine,

22:30.281 --> 22:31.748
Elaine, don't, don't!

22:31.783 --> 22:33.750
Elaine! Elaine!

22:33.785 --> 22:35.952
You'll be no better than him.

22:39.957 --> 22:41.959
You're right, Alex.

22:41.993 --> 22:44.962
And I'm a lot better
          than he is.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.296
Come on, let's go.

22:46.364 --> 22:48.866
Wait for me!
(Vincenzo chuckling)

23:03.547 --> 23:05.515
She may be
                better than you,

23:05.549 --> 23:07.584
but I ain't.

23:17.895 --> 23:19.763
¶

23:29.273 --> 23:31.241
(Pac-Man game whirring
          and beeping)

23:36.447 --> 23:38.282
(game ends)

23:38.316 --> 23:43.453
I-I don't know
     why I play this game.

23:43.488 --> 23:45.455
Throbbing noises,

23:45.490 --> 23:47.991
flashing lights,

23:48.026 --> 23:50.960
monsters chasing you--

23:50.995 --> 23:53.263
I get enough of that
         in real life.

24:02.540 --> 24:05.008
(theme song playing)

24:28.132 --> 24:29.633
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:29.667 --> 24:30.667
(man grumbling)
