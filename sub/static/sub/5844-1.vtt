Molly, your father committed suicide

In rereading the transcripts of your case,
I was struck by something.

37:37.520 --> 37:39.420
You claimed that on your 18th birthday,

37:39.520 --> 37:42.660
you were essentially
possessed by the devil.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.000
Correct?

37:48.800 --> 37:52.361
But you testified you believed
that this was only the first phase.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.300
You quoted your school counselor,
Dr. Emerson,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.100
the woman who betrayed you,

37:58.200 --> 38:01.380
as saying, "We have watched you grow.

38:01.480 --> 38:04.300
There are great things ahead.

38:04.400 --> 38:06.402
You are the one."

38:08.120 --> 38:10.940
You said in court that you've come
to believe that what she meant by that...

38:11.040 --> 38:15.523
was that you will be the one who will
return Satan to this mortal coil.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.250
Is that correct?

38:20.920 --> 38:24.811
You believe your possession on your
18th birthday is like a pregnancy...

38:26.680 --> 38:29.684

to term in your 24th year.

38:32.560 --> 38:34.460

38:34.560 --> 38:39.009
Maybe this is some sort of psychosomatic
self-fulfilling prophecy.

38:40.240 --> 38:43.980
You believed this would happen
on your 24th birthday,

38:44.080 --> 38:46.340
so now your mind is willing it to be.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.728
And it's manifesting physically
with the vomiting and the noises.

need to incubate from 18 to 24?

I have been thinking about it.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.964

44:55.440 --> 44:58.460
Yes. I think she's possessed.

44:58.560 --> 45:00.980
Then what you need is a priest.

45:01.080 --> 45:03.500
I read that once a man is ordained
as a priest, he's always a priest.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.260
What you need is a priest
that's still ordained by the church.

45:17.040 --> 45:18.644
Can we talk somewhere else?

45:20.160 --> 45:22.380
I read that there are
two types of exorcisms...

45:22.480 --> 45:24.380
Solemn and unofficial.

45:24.480 --> 45:27.700
A solemn exorcism has to be
approved by the church.

45:27.800 --> 45:30.690
An unofficial exorcism
can be performed by a layperson.

45:31.680 --> 45:33.660
Someone's been doing their homework.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.700
After all the lawsuits
and bad media attention,

45:36.800 --> 45:40.980
the Roman Catholic church no longer even
teaches priests how to perform exorcisms.

45:41.080 --> 45:44.880
As of last year, there's only 17
trained exorcists in all of America.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.082
- Including me.
- Including you.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.740
- Yeah.
- And of those 17,

45:48.840 --> 45:51.180
only one has been involved
in an actual exorcism.

45:51.280 --> 45:53.408
- Me.
- You.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.580
You know the ritual of exorcism, Barrow.

45:56.680 --> 45:58.580
You no longer need approval.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.603
Think of this as your redemption.

46:02.360 --> 46:04.660

- Please.

52:09.840 --> 52:13.322
In high school, she was
an average student. Nothing special.

Then on her 18th birthday,
everything changed.
