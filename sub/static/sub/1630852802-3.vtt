00:00.933 --> 00:02.735
- Miss Teen Connecticut in the house.
- [cheers]

00:02.737 --> 00:06.705
Today's the first day of Aniko's
Miss Teen Connecticut Pageant.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.540
[photographer] Just smile
like that. There you go.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.343
And I am officially
a pageant mom.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.712
-[Darcey cheering] Aniko! Aniko!
-[Aniko] Mom. No no no no no.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.080
You are so loud.

00:15.082 --> 00:18.050
If my mom gets thrown out of
the pageant for being over the top,

00:18.052 --> 00:20.386
I honestly wouldn't even
be surprised.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.920
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:21.922 --> 00:23.689
[Darcey] <i>I went to go
see Georgi in New York.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:24.923
- I gave back the ring.
- Good.

00:24.925 --> 00:27.426
But, it got
a little hot and heavy.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.030
So, you gave back the ring
and then [bleep] the guy?

00:31.032 --> 00:34.433
This is too much. I
can't. I can't. Sorry.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.236
[Georgi speaking]

00:39.005 --> 00:41.473
You don't feel heard?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.709
<i>[Darcey] I have never seen
Georgi open up like this.</i>

00:43.711 --> 00:45.044
<i>And get vulnerable.</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:46.345
And that shows me that
there is willingness

00:46.347 --> 00:47.779
to be in this relationship
with me.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.886
I think it would be really beneficial
if Georgi comes on this trip.

00:53.888 --> 00:56.522
I don't feel like he
deserves to come to Miami.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.558
I feel like you haven't really
proven yourself.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.427
[Stacey]
<i>Georgi coming to Miami</i>

01:01.429 --> 01:03.929
is gonna jeopardize the
success of the fashion show.

01:03.931 --> 01:06.498
I don't wanna be around the
drama. We don't need that.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.170
[opening theme music playing]

01:27.687 --> 01:30.089
[indistinct chatter]

01:30.091 --> 01:31.190
[Darcey] She is gonna
love these.

01:31.991 --> 01:33.258
[moans] Smell them.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.194
[Darcey] What?

01:35.196 --> 01:36.995
You don't like them because
they are not Bulgarian roses?

01:36.997 --> 01:38.530
[Georgi speaking]

01:38.532 --> 01:41.700
They are beautiful.
This is for my daughter.

01:41.702 --> 01:45.771
Today's the day of Aniko's
Miss Teen Connecticut Pageant.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.508
And I cannot be
more proud of her.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.877
Unfortunately for me,
there are pageant rules

01:51.879 --> 01:53.879
and I can't be backstage.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.848
So, I need to extra loud

01:55.850 --> 01:58.450
so she can hear me and... and
know that I am here to support her.

01:59.552 --> 02:02.154
Thank you for coming

02:02.156 --> 02:05.991
to help support, you know,
her as well. Means a lot to me.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.861
[Georgi speaking]

02:08.863 --> 02:09.795
Yeah, thank you. So...

02:09.797 --> 02:10.729
[Georgi speaking]

02:11.965 --> 02:13.832
You don't have
the title right now, Georgi.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.134
We have to, like, take our time.

02:15.136 --> 02:16.335
[Georgi speaking]

02:47.934 --> 02:49.368
- [Darcey] Well, hey.
- [Georgi] Hey.

02:49.435 --> 02:52.638
-[Darcey] Hey, guys. Hey, Stacey got flowers.
-Hey, honey. I got flowers.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.974
[Stacey] <i>It's been a couple of
days since Georgi cooked for us</i>

02:55.976 --> 02:58.076
and apologized
and said some nice things.

02:58.078 --> 03:01.446
I have had time to process
what he said, and you know,

03:02.949 --> 03:04.917
I guess at this point
it is what it is.

03:04.984 --> 03:06.952
[indistinct chatter]

03:08.288 --> 03:09.955
Well, I am glad
you are here, Georgi.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.990
It's, you know,
a great first step.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.760
[Georgi speaking]

03:14.762 --> 03:17.329
[Darcey] Yeah, kids
come first. [softly] Yeah.

03:18.364 --> 03:22.267
I just hope that from here
on now, you do the right thing.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.136
Yeah.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.039
[Georgi speaking]

03:37.083 --> 03:39.751
- [Darcey] Hey, Dad.
- [Stacey] Hey.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.186
- [Darcey] Hey.
- [Stacey] Hey, are you excited?

03:41.188 --> 03:42.888
[Mike] I am good.
He is doing okay?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.256
[Georgi speaking]

03:45.725 --> 03:46.525
[Mike speaking]

03:46.527 --> 03:47.993
[Mike] Did you see her yet?

03:47.995 --> 03:50.762
No. Aspen's actually trying to
go backstage and look for her.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.098
That means just to see her.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.834
-[Stacey] You wanna get in line?
-[Darcey] For the tickets.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.236
[Florian and Georgi speaking]

03:57.238 --> 03:59.071

03:59.739 --> 04:01.373
- Thank you.

04:01.375 --> 04:04.509
- Where is my kiss?
- [Stacey] Ew.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.211
[Mike] What's going on?

04:07.113 --> 04:09.848
You know, we are making effort,

04:09.850 --> 04:11.116
both of us. 50-50.

04:11.118 --> 04:15.020
Yeah, he is making effort
right now but I am still not sure

04:15.022 --> 04:18.023
I feel comfortable
with Georgi going to Miami.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.591
- [Mike] Okay.
- [Stacey] 'Cause I wanna enjoy my trip.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.861
- I don't wanna stress...
- Okay, okay. We are here, we are here for Aniko.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.230
- [Stacey] Right. Yeah.
- [Mike] Let's make this about Aniko.

04:26.799 --> 04:27.866
[Mike]
I am gonna go find the guys.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.135
[Darcey] Okay. Let's do this.

04:31.871 --> 04:33.205
<i>[Mike] I have my own...</i>

04:34.340 --> 04:35.974
thoughts. My own concerns.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.110
[Mike] <i>But today is
Aniko's special day.</i>

04:48.321 --> 04:51.256
It's literally almost here.
I am in my black dress.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.425
I am so excited.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.495
Oh, my gosh. Love it!

04:56.497 --> 04:59.164
I have been preparing for
this one for, like, months now.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.100
And being a part
of this pageant process

05:02.102 --> 05:03.168
helped me a lot
with my confidence.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.070
I am so excited for it.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.105
I am getting, like, butterflies.

[Darcey] You looked confident.
You owned that stage.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.483
There was a lot of emotions
that were running through her

09:45.485 --> 09:47.452
and I could see it in her eyes
because I am the same way.

09:47.454 --> 09:51.823

game before we go out tonight.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.145
Huh?

11:20.147 --> 11:21.946
A quiz. Like a pop... pop
quiz. You ever do a pop quiz?

11:33.559 --> 11:35.827
Okay. Pick a easy one?

11:35.829 --> 11:39.330
How many states are in the
United States of America?

11:39.899 --> 11:41.266
[Florian speaking]

11:41.268 --> 11:42.901
No, you gotta have an answer.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.869
[Florian speaking]

11:44.871 --> 11:48.139
- 51.51.51.
- [Florian] Huh.

11:49.108 --> 11:52.844
[woman speaking]

11:52.846 --> 11:55.447
There are 51 states in the USA.

11:56.849 --> 11:57.816
Pretty sure.

11:57.818 --> 12:00.452
Um...
There's Puerto Rico.

12:01.153 --> 12:02.854
- [woman laughs]
- No?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.457
- [woman] There's 50.
- 50 states. Yeah.

12:06.759 --> 12:07.826
I am feeling a little anxious.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.428
I know that Debbie and Reina
is gonna be there.

12:10.430 --> 12:13.231
Georgi, Darcey, my mom
and dad. And I just feel like

12:13.233 --> 12:16.801
you know, this is the first time
we have all been together since...

12:16.803 --> 12:19.037
[Florian speaking]

12:19.039 --> 12:21.473
Yeah, I just feel like, they
feel like how I feel. Just...

12:22.108 --> 12:23.742
They've had enough
with the whole...

12:23.744 --> 12:26.411
up and down up and
down relationship.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.215
I am looking forward to
the party but I am worried.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.717
<i>[Stacey] It's supposed to be
a celebration of our brand.</i>

12:32.719 --> 12:34.919
I just...
[sighs]

12:34.921 --> 12:36.955
I just don't want there
to be a blowup.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.924
And it end like the last time.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.994
[sighs] Just talking about it
makes me, like, tense.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.662
I don't know
what to expect tonight.

12:44.664 --> 12:46.131
[Florian speaking]

12:47.066 --> 12:50.168
I don't wanna feel drained,
when I go to Miami.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.507
[all exclaiming] Hey!

12:55.509 --> 12:57.742
<i>[Darcey] I am full of worry.</i>

12:57.744 --> 13:00.712
I don't think they are gonna like
that Georgi is coming to the party.

13:00.714 --> 13:03.414
I just wanna apologize
for the other night. Umm.

13:03.983 --> 13:06.985
But Georgi is coming.
Today.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.122
[Darcey]
Miami, here we come!

13:13.058 --> 13:15.527
- [Stacey] What's he doing?
- He is trying to impress us, Stacey.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.229
[all screaming] Oh, my God.
Oh, no.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.198
[Georgi speaking]

13:33.112 --> 13:36.114
Honey, it feels really nice that
the girls are gonna be there.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.283
Like a fun little party.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.954
[Georgi] Nobody likes surprises.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.491
[Darcey] Nobody likes surprises.
But you know it is what it is.

13:49.228 --> 13:51.963
<i>[Darcey] I am excited
for this party.</i>

13:51.965 --> 13:54.265
But I am a little

13:54.267 --> 13:56.701
anxious because I don't know
what to expect.

13:56.768 --> 13:58.837
[Darcey] We're here.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.840
<i>[Darcey] Last time I saw Debbie
and Reina, they walked away,</i>

14:01.842 --> 14:04.876
because Georgi and I are
giving our relationship another go.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.444
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, there.

14:06.446 --> 14:08.880
- Hey. How are you?
- How are you?

14:08.882 --> 14:12.150
I don't think they're gonna like the
fact that I'm bringing Georgi to the party.

14:12.152 --> 14:15.320
But I just hope that
things go well today.

14:16.956 --> 14:18.055
Everything's out?

14:18.123 --> 14:20.892
Everything's out. Alright.
Let's go start decorating.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.227
My God. You guys look so cute!

14:22.229 --> 14:23.261
How does mommy looks?

14:24.096 --> 14:25.496
Oh, here.

14:25.498 --> 14:27.532
Alright. I got it. Let me give
it to mommy.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.125
[sighing]

15:00.232 --> 15:02.000
[Mike] Yeah.

15:02.002 --> 15:02.500
[Georgi clearing throat]

15:03.269 --> 15:05.036
[Georgi sighing]

15:15.781 --> 15:17.115
Has it helped?

15:27.493 --> 15:29.060
[Mike] You're taking the steps.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.328
That's good.

15:31.697 --> 15:33.898
Both of you and equally,

15:33.900 --> 15:36.634
have to put an effort into it.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.136
Like putting a seed
in the ground.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.472
And you want to
have the plan grow.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.942
<i>[Mike] Darcey and Georgi
are going to counselling.</i>

15:43.944 --> 15:45.977
<i>That's positive, obviously.</i>

15:45.979 --> 15:49.213
However, I worry
that the relationship that

15:49.848 --> 15:51.816
Darcey's hoping for

15:51.818 --> 15:55.253
with Georgi may not materialize.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.856
I'll be very frank. It just
doesn't affect you and her.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.158
- Yeah.
- It affects the girls.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.161
This could be a good time
for you to

16:03.163 --> 16:05.430
create bonding time
with the girls.

16:05.998 --> 16:07.332
You need to know them better.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.467
They get to know you better.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.538
You get to know if you
like one another, okay?

16:13.540 --> 16:17.208
Trust me. My last wife
did not like my kids.

16:17.210 --> 16:20.211
[Mike] Maybe I didn't
handle it well. But the point is

16:21.714 --> 16:23.915
that's a key component

16:23.917 --> 16:26.951
to the success of
your relationship as well.

16:28.053 --> 16:32.123
[Mike] He needs to understand
that the relationship is not just Darcey.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.825
But it's Darcey
and her daughters.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.194
<i>You can't keep the</i>

16:36.196 --> 16:40.298
children on the side and expect to
have a solid relationship with the mother.

16:40.300 --> 16:44.102
<i>If Georgi doesn't make an effort
to bond with Aspen and Aniko,</i>

16:44.104 --> 16:47.138
I think the future that he
has what Darcey is

16:49.808 --> 16:50.975
not as bright.

16:51.710 --> 16:52.944
Not as bright.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.815
- Wow. This is so nice.
- Yay.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.851
- Woohoo...
- [all cheering]

16:59.853 --> 17:04.022
[indistinct chatter]

17:04.024 --> 17:06.491
-Whoo. You girls look gorgeous.
-Yeah.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.960
[Reina] The last time we saw
Darcey and Stacey

17:08.962 --> 17:09.960
you know, we walked out

17:09.962 --> 17:11.662
<i>'cause of what was going on
with Georgi.</i>

17:11.664 --> 17:14.198
<i>The twins and I have
been friends longer than</i>

17:14.200 --> 17:17.168
pretty much Georgi
has probably been

17:17.170 --> 17:18.803
on planet Earth for.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.140
So I don't give a [bleep] what's
going on with them at this point.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.941
<i>We just wanna celebrate
their business.</i>

17:23.943 --> 17:26.344
It's gonna be great.
[bleep] the rest.

17:27.646 --> 17:31.749
- Congratulations. This is you.
- I know we have a lot at stake.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.486
[Darcey] You know, I'm just
grateful for you both and I just wanna

17:35.488 --> 17:37.722
really let you know, from the bottom
of my heart, I just wanna apologize

17:37.724 --> 17:41.025
for the other night when
we were at dad's, you know.

17:41.727 --> 17:45.830
I just... Now I'm really trying to
work hard on this relationship.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.934
- Figure it all out.
- I don't know if it needs an apology, honey, but it's just,

17:49.936 --> 17:52.170
- it's just like you know...
- Yeah.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.039
It's the same [bleep]
different day type of thing.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.142
I'm just a little nervous
because, um,

18:00.179 --> 18:02.380
I don't know if you guys know
but Georgi's coming

18:02.981 --> 18:04.015
today.

18:04.082 --> 18:05.149
And...

18:05.151 --> 18:07.051
[dramatic music playing]

18:07.053 --> 18:08.019
Yeah.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.993
I mean, your decision
is your decision, honey.

18:17.863 --> 18:21.099
- [all] Cheers!
- Oh, we gotta get you a cocktail!

18:21.101 --> 18:23.134
[Darcey] It's not like
me but... [laughing]

18:23.136 --> 18:25.169
It's okay, we love
you anyway, bitch.

18:25.237 --> 18:26.270
Yup.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.245
[all] Hey!

18:34.247 --> 18:35.947
[Georgi] Good. How are you?

18:35.949 --> 18:36.914
- I'm good.
- Hi Georgi.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.083
- Hey.
- You look great.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.052
- [Georgi] You too.
- [Darcey] Looks like you're ready for Miami.

18:41.054 --> 18:45.790
- [car honking]
- [all cheering]

18:45.792 --> 18:48.226
Come on, Stace.
Get Miami ready.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.760
[Stacey] Hey guys.

18:49.762 --> 18:52.497
[all cheering]

18:52.499 --> 18:53.965
Oh, she's Miami gold.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.500
Oh, Nana's here.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.970
[indistinct shouting]

18:58.972 --> 19:03.241
- Take it off!
- [cheering]

19:03.675 --> 19:05.643
Nana going to the club.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.746
When all the Silvas get
together for family gatherings,

19:08.748 --> 19:12.016
we have so much fun.
We joke. We laugh.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.019
And you know, it's always
good time. Good bonding time.

19:15.254 --> 19:16.787
Party game.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.956
[all] Yay.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.658
[speaking indistinctly]

19:20.660 --> 19:22.860
Let's have fun.
Let's let lose.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.829
Come on Nana.
You know how to let lose.

19:24.831 --> 19:25.997
Oh, I gotta eat.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.932
[laughs heartily]

19:27.934 --> 19:28.866
Who's first?

19:28.868 --> 19:30.501
You better catch it, bitch.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.805
[Darcey] Yay!

19:34.807 --> 19:37.475
[Darcey] I think we played ring
toss more as kids or something.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.911
- Backyard.
- Make do with what you have.

19:39.913 --> 19:42.213
Exactly. You know,
you gotta improvised.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.683
[all] Yay.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.718
You know use your
arms, your legs, your head.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.986
Our dad always taught us...

19:48.988 --> 19:50.721
[both] ...to figure it out.

19:50.723 --> 19:51.889
[Stacey] We figured it out.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.691
Yeah, on my foot. Yeah.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.493
[both laughing]

19:55.495 --> 19:56.994
How about Georgi rings you?

19:56.996 --> 19:59.630
[indistinct shouting]

19:59.632 --> 20:01.966
- You better ring your girl, Georgi.
- Yeah.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.102
- [Darcey] That's right.
- [all] Ohhh!

20:05.104 --> 20:07.004
[Darcey] That's what
I'm talking about.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.840
- [all] Wow!
- [Darcey] There we go. See.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.909
That's how you do it.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.079
- [Reina] At this fun time, I like Georgi as a person.
- [Debbie] Me too.

20:15.081 --> 20:18.950
[Reina] I do. And then there's
Darcey, who is a wonderful person.

20:18.952 --> 20:21.786
<i>But Darcey and Georgi's
relationship</i>

20:21.788 --> 20:25.590
changes more than people
change underwear. It's crazy.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.493
At this point, we're just
rooting for Darcey's happiness.

20:29.495 --> 20:31.896
[Darcey] Stacey and I just wanna
say how excited we are for Miami.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.599
To be accepted in this
fashion show means a lot.

20:34.601 --> 20:37.902
We've done Europe Fashion Week, LA
Fashion Week, now Miami Swim Week.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.904
We worked really hard to get
here and we just wanna thank

20:39.906 --> 20:41.973
each and every one of you guys.

20:41.975 --> 20:43.941
- [Stacey] Yes. Thank you everybody and...
- [Reina] Of course.

20:43.943 --> 20:48.746
[Reina] Can we see the runway walk when
you and Stacey come out holding hands?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.414
[Darcey] Stace, wanna show
them our walk?

20:50.416 --> 20:52.850
[indistinct conversation]

20:52.852 --> 20:56.621
[Darcey] At the end of the fashion show
Stacey and I are gonna do a finale walk and

20:56.623 --> 20:58.689
that's what designers do
at the end of their show.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.791
[Stacey] Remember the
fashion show we did in New York?

21:00.793 --> 21:04.862
- We were about to do the runway and I started wobbling.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, wow.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.765
- My ankles were giving out.
- Yeah. We were wearing our brands.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.900
[Stacey] So Darcey made it down
the runaway and then she looks...

21:09.902 --> 21:11.469
[Darcey] I look back...
Where's Stacey?

21:11.471 --> 21:12.970
- She saw me on the ground.
- She's on the ground.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.806
- I felt so bad.
- My ankles gave out and my knees...

21:15.808 --> 21:17.808
My knees and my ankles...
I don't know what happened.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.577
What is it with us
and heels, and like...

21:19.579 --> 21:22.113
- falling.
- I don't know. Clumsy.

21:22.115 --> 21:24.849
'Cause right after that I
got stuck in the escalator.

21:24.851 --> 21:27.318
- The same [bleep] shoe?
- It was the same shoe.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.653
The black heel.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.321
[Darcey speaking]

21:37.629 --> 21:40.231
- Those shoes are now retired.
- Yeah.

21:41.066 --> 21:44.068
[Reina] You know what to
do girls. I've seen it before.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.037
- Boss bitch mode.
- Yes, boss bitch.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.976
- [all cheering]
- Sexy!

21:52.077 --> 21:55.880
[all] Whoo-hoo!

21:55.882 --> 21:58.616
<i>[Darcey] We have an
equally powerful...</i>

21:58.618 --> 22:01.986
[Stacey] Yes. [Darcey] ...inspiring
walk, I feel like it's, you know...

22:01.988 --> 22:04.355
[Stacey] It's simply not competition
when it comes to our runway walk.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.057
[Darcey] Yeah.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.760
- You guys look awesome.
- Yes, give a kiss.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.530
[indistinct chatter]

22:12.532 --> 22:14.765
[Stacey] Like...
don't mess with us.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.667
- Yeah like you're on a mission.
- We're on a mission.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.736
- [laughing]
- [Reina] There you go.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.172
- [Darcey] We did it!
- [Stacey] Yeah. Right!

22:21.174 --> 22:23.007
-[Darcey] Like a swag
-[Stacey] Yeah.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.275
[Stacey] It's a swag about ya.

22:27.579 --> 22:30.014
[all cheering]

22:30.016 --> 22:33.718
[Darcey] We worked hard and
we're ready to keep our eyes

22:33.720 --> 22:36.654
on the prize
'cause Miami here we come.

22:36.656 --> 22:41.359
- [Darcey and Stacey
vocalizing] - Eyes on the prize.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.862
[Darcey] Stacey and I always
dream about being

22:44.864 --> 22:47.431
- superstar recording artists.
- Hell, yeah.

22:47.433 --> 22:50.034
We met some people that
were in the music industry

22:50.036 --> 22:53.204
when we went to LA. They
invited us to the music studio and...

22:53.905 --> 22:54.839
That's how it started.

22:54.841 --> 22:57.842
[vocalizing]

22:57.844 --> 23:01.946
-We recorded "Doing it Big". That was in different...
-In clubs and on the radio.

23:01.948 --> 23:04.482
- streams. So...
- We had people coming up to us like

23:04.484 --> 23:06.884
I love your songs.
I love the Silva twins.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.453
[Darcey] And for this show, we're
gonna walk down the runway to our song...

23:09.455 --> 23:10.755
[both] "Doing it Big."

23:10.757 --> 23:13.524
- Hey.
- It might be a little auto tuned. But that's okay.

23:13.526 --> 23:14.925
- No shame in our game.
- That's okay.

23:14.927 --> 23:18.062
[both] <i>♪ Lock my number in
your phone Lock, lock, lock it ♪</i>

23:18.064 --> 23:21.532
<i>♪ Lock my number in your phone
Doing' it big! ♪</i>

23:26.938 --> 23:29.473
So cheugy is basically
something nice,

23:29.475 --> 23:31.776
very out of style.

23:31.778 --> 23:36.180
-Or not trendy at all. Like something that look...
-Basically like very cringy.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.186
Alright. This ain't
no spelling bee.

23:42.188 --> 23:46.290
-[Darcey] Yeah. See you in Miami.
-[Stacey] See you in Miami.

23:46.292 --> 23:50.761
<i>[Darcey] We're all having so much fun today.
And I feel like everyone's getting along.</i>

23:50.763 --> 23:55.766
For them to see us, making the progress
that we've made is a world of change.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.236
<i>There's all love here.
And I hope that it stays</i>

23:59.238 --> 24:01.238
this way, it stays consistent,
but

24:01.706 --> 24:03.073
it's a good feeling.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.075
- [Darcey] To family.
- [all] To family.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.745
[Darcey] I love you all.
Cheers.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.147
- [Mike] You set up the budget?
- [Darcey] Yes.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.683
- [Mike] 'Cause you know we spent a lot of money?
- [Darcey] I know.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.952
[Mike] Years ago, my point is

24:14.954 --> 24:17.121
I'm not gonna contribute
like I did before.

24:19.057 --> 24:21.692
[Darcey] A friend of ours,
Michael Benz.

24:21.694 --> 24:22.960
He's gonna be in Miami.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.996
It's a friend of ours in LA.

24:27.499 --> 24:29.266
Are you jealous?
'Cause you're acting jealous.

24:43.949 --> 24:46.250
- [Stacey] Hey, Darce.
- [Darcey] Hey.

24:46.252 --> 24:48.819
- Mmm. Seen anything good?
- Oh, yeah.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.321
[Darcey] Got a lot of stuff.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.822
- Yeah. I know.
- Going through.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.290
Me too.

24:53.292 --> 24:56.360
[Darcey] Our dad is selling his house
so he could buy his dream home and

24:56.362 --> 24:57.728
retire comfortably.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.498
Look what I found.
Remember this Stacey dress?

25:00.500 --> 25:02.967
-Oh, yeah.
-I like this color. It's powerful.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.735
Whatever.
You can have it.

25:04.737 --> 25:06.871
<i>[Darcey] When we were
still married, Stacey and I</i>

25:06.873 --> 25:09.807
lived in the house
with our husbands and kids and

25:09.809 --> 25:11.509
you know, we all shared it.
It was like...

25:11.511 --> 25:13.010
- a good time.
- The Silva bunch.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.813
[Darcey] Yeah. We've accumulated
a lot of stuff over the years.

25:15.815 --> 25:17.181
<i>So now we have to declutter it,</i>

25:17.183 --> 25:18.916
<i>so he can put the house
on the market.</i>

25:18.918 --> 25:21.118
Dad said,
"Come get your stuff!"

25:21.120 --> 25:23.854
- He doesn't want our stuff sitting around.
- Yeah.

25:23.856 --> 25:25.823
[Mike] Did I hear
Stacey's voice?

25:25.825 --> 25:27.691
- [Stacey] Hey, Dad.
- When did you get here?

25:27.693 --> 25:29.326
[Stacey] Ah, few minutes ago.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.661
- [Mike] So...
- [Stacey] Just helping...

25:30.663 --> 25:31.729
- organize.
- Yeah.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.631
You're packing up
all your stuff?

25:33.633 --> 25:35.132
[Stacey] Downsizing
a little bit, yeah.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.268
[Mike] So you getting ready
for Miami?

25:37.270 --> 25:40.204
Yeah. The theme
is gonna be 11/11,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.672
angelic, light and bright,

25:41.674 --> 25:44.942
and manifesting.

25:44.944 --> 25:48.712
The theme of the fashion show is 11/11.
Never give up. Manifest your dreams.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.848
<i>I'm a manifestor.
She's a manifestor.</i>

25:50.850 --> 25:55.152
<i>When you see 11/11, you know,
close your eyes and make that wish.</i>

25:55.154 --> 26:00.457
It's a power number.
It gives us... special powers.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.160
- Manifesting power.
- Yeah.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.695
- Exactly.
- [Darcey] Strength.

26:04.697 --> 26:06.864
Mmm-hmm.

26:06.866 --> 26:08.866
- Time to manifest.
- That's right.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.167
You have models and stuff?

26:10.702 --> 26:13.037
-We have models. We'll have a casting.
-A cast for models, yes.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.705
We have a hair and makeup team.

26:14.707 --> 26:15.706
You set up the budget?

26:15.708 --> 26:18.475
- Yes.
- It's already been taken care of.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.544
[Darcey] Actually the amount
that we're spending

26:20.546 --> 26:22.146
fits perfectly in our budget.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.582
- [Mike] 'Cause we spent a lot of money...
- [both] I know.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.851
[Mike] ...years ago doing this
similar kind of things,

26:27.853 --> 26:31.388
- with a not so focused effort.
- Yeah. I know.

26:31.390 --> 26:35.025
<i>[Mike] When my daughters
first decided to go to LA,</i>

26:35.027 --> 26:39.496
they needed to make sure their
focus was on the business, and not LA,

26:39.498 --> 26:41.098
and the LA scene.

26:41.100 --> 26:47.137
But they were spending too much, too
quick with too many unfocused activities.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.506
They went a little bit
over the top.

26:49.508 --> 26:52.843
My point is, I'm not gonna
contribute like I did before.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.712
Well, we haven't asked for
anything.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.814
We appreciate everything
you helped in the past.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.148
[Stacey] But I know in the past,

26:58.817 --> 27:01.085
you know, we over indulged.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.520
And we've learned our lessons.

27:03.522 --> 27:06.056
<i>Our father was
our angel investor</i>

27:06.058 --> 27:10.094
when we started House of Eleven. When
we first went to LA, we did over indulge.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.963
- Luxury apartments.
- [both] Luxury cars.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.833
- Shopping sprees.
- Office in Beverly Hills.

27:15.835 --> 27:16.934
We have to have the best
of the best.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.937
Maybe, we took it
too extreme too quick.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.873
- I miss those luxury cars.
- Yeah.

27:22.875 --> 27:25.976
[both laughing]

27:25.978 --> 27:29.480
My only concern is, you know
you're dealing with a relationship.

27:29.948 --> 27:32.216
Can you stay focused?

27:32.218 --> 27:34.485
- Yeah.
- You cannot afford any drama.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.620
- [Darcey] No.
- During this period of time.

27:36.622 --> 27:40.958
[Darcey] Not gonna let any sort
of drama get to me. If something...

27:40.960 --> 27:43.994
happens then, he can get on
the next flight out.

27:45.463 --> 27:48.799
[Mike] I'm not thrilled
about Georgi going to Miami.

27:48.801 --> 27:51.135
<i>I mean, the girls are spending
time, money and effort</i>

27:51.137 --> 27:53.737
for their business.
That's their primary focus.

27:53.739 --> 27:56.774
I do not want
or expect any drama

27:56.776 --> 27:58.709
to get in the middle
of that to...

27:58.711 --> 28:01.478
impact their ability
to put on a good show.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.681
- Focus, focus, focus.
- Right.

28:03.683 --> 28:06.083
And if you don't do that,
you're just gonna waste money.

28:22.867 --> 28:25.969
Hey, babe. I got
the wax strips for Miami.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.171
You wanna wax me?

28:28.873 --> 28:30.474
I wanna be silky smooth.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.509
I got some scraggles.

28:32.511 --> 28:37.748
<i>Florian has waxed my legs
quite a few times. He grooms me.</i>

28:37.750 --> 28:41.485
Fix my hair, my lashes
if they're like falling off,

28:41.487 --> 28:44.855
put lip gloss on me,
and contour me,

28:44.857 --> 28:46.457
bronze me, spray tan me.

28:48.093 --> 28:48.792
[laughs]

28:48.794 --> 28:50.961
Yeah, we should open a salon.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.165
We'll go to Miami baby, I'm
gonna be in a lot of bikinis.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.235
The pool, the beach.

29:00.939 --> 29:02.306
What do you mean, over the top?

29:02.308 --> 29:04.074
I'm not gonna be over the top
I'm gonna be me,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.009
I'm gonna dress how
I feel like dressing.

29:07.178 --> 29:07.978
Do right here.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.880
Thank you.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.883
Florian doesn't like
when I show too much skin.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.418
<i>He's just old school like that.</i>

29:15.353 --> 29:16.186
[exhales]

29:16.188 --> 29:17.354
Wow.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.023
Why do you get slow like that?

29:22.794 --> 29:23.761
<i>Let me tell you something,</i>

29:23.763 --> 29:27.231
I did not get snatched
to hide my body at home.

29:27.233 --> 29:30.267
So when we go to Miami,
I'm gonna be showing it off.

29:31.002 --> 29:31.702
Aah.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.904
- It suits ya.
- [exhales] Jesus!

29:33.906 --> 29:36.373
I think you're doing this on purpose
'cause you don't want me to...

29:36.375 --> 29:40.110
- [Florian] Seem pervert.
- be in swimsuits and stuff.

29:40.311 --> 29:41.311
[groans]

29:41.746 --> 29:42.980
Ow.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.516
Nah, I don't flirt,
I don't cheat.

29:58.930 --> 30:01.365
Aren't you excited for the
fashion show, cause I'm ready.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.767
I'm feeling boss-mode.

30:03.769 --> 30:04.968
Me and Darcey are

30:04.970 --> 30:07.004
excited, we got everything
ready to go.

30:07.006 --> 30:07.838
Uh-huh.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.474
A friend of ours, Michael Benz,

30:10.476 --> 30:13.310
he's gonna be in Miami,
and he's coming to the show.

30:14.846 --> 30:16.446
He's a friend of ours, from LA.

30:17.048 --> 30:20.784
Michael is a DJ,
and he's a fashion designer.

30:20.786 --> 30:24.254
<i>We met Michael
on a video fashion shoot,</i>

30:24.256 --> 30:28.125
years ago in Los Angeles, and
we've been friends ever since.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.862
We've done business with him
before. We've collabed with him.

30:31.864 --> 30:35.132
You know, it will be great to connect
with him, and have some, you know

30:35.934 --> 30:37.234
business meetings.

30:40.205 --> 30:40.838
No.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.473
[suspenseful music playing]

30:45.910 --> 30:49.079
This is a business meeting, it's
not anything else than that, it's just...

30:51.716 --> 30:53.016
Yeah.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.498
Are you jealous, 'cause
you're acting jealous.

31:10.969 --> 31:13.337
Okay.

31:13.339 --> 31:17.407
In Miami, we're gonna be surrounded
by gorgeous men and women,

31:18.109 --> 31:21.845
and he needs to understand that.

31:21.847 --> 31:24.081
This is business.
This is a job.

31:25.049 --> 31:28.485
So he needs to respect that,
and not get jealous.

31:29.854 --> 31:31.288
[groans softly]

31:32.056 --> 31:33.190
Oh, God.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.193
Girls, let's go.

31:36.195 --> 31:37.394
Did you get your swimsuits?

31:46.504 --> 31:47.604
Aw Grandpa.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.473
Hugs for Grandpa.

32:06.024 --> 32:08.492
I don't even know how this
is gonna fit, but I like it.

32:09.894 --> 32:11.061
It's Miami colors.

32:15.066 --> 32:16.400
All eyes on me.

32:16.402 --> 32:20.704
Baby in the hot city.

32:20.706 --> 32:24.007
<i>We're so excited for fashion
week, and I'm really excited</i>

32:24.009 --> 32:27.444
to see Georgi bond with the girls,
and just be there together as a family.

32:29.881 --> 32:30.614
Yeah.

32:30.616 --> 32:31.782
You know how we roll.

32:33.084 --> 32:37.154
That suitcase is worth more
than all four plane tickets.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.057
I don't mess around when I pack.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.926
I have to match the sunglasses
with the outfit,

32:42.928 --> 32:44.962
sometimes I'm
in different moods,

32:44.964 --> 32:47.064
sometimes like I'm faux chic or

32:47.066 --> 32:50.100
I love those sexy
see-through aviators.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.502
Oh, yeah. My glasses.

32:53.404 --> 32:56.273
No, no... you're gonna
stretch them out.

32:56.674 --> 32:58.008
These are mine.

32:58.010 --> 32:59.409
You're not taking these ones.

33:05.216 --> 33:06.216
Oh.

33:06.684 --> 33:09.152
Wow, baby!

33:10.121 --> 33:12.089
Yeah, save our relationship.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.390
Do it big!

33:14.359 --> 33:15.959
I like that.

33:16.995 --> 33:20.998
Miami's gonna be good for us. Yeah,
we did meet there for the very first time,

33:21.499 --> 33:23.367
and now we get to
go back together,

33:23.968 --> 33:26.169
and rekindle.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.773
Georgi and I first met in Miami.

33:29.775 --> 33:31.875
<i>We were just, you know,
living life really free,</i>

33:31.877 --> 33:34.511
<i>and trying to learn
about each other.</i>

33:34.513 --> 33:39.182
It's where we first connected,
and, you know, fell for each other.

33:39.184 --> 33:43.487
It was a beautiful time, and I hope
we can get to that feeling again.

33:44.122 --> 33:46.156
You remember our first date?

33:47.225 --> 33:48.992
We sure had a lot of fun.

33:48.994 --> 33:50.394
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, yeah.

33:51.195 --> 33:52.329
Round two?

33:54.198 --> 33:55.465
I'm getting that spice back.

33:57.168 --> 33:58.368
Miami heat baby.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.337
Come here.

34:01.839 --> 34:02.873
Well, keep me happy.

34:04.575 --> 34:06.777
I want his relationship to
work and I want Georgi

34:06.779 --> 34:08.478
to be able to bond with
my kids and my family.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.180
<i>I want him to feel that,</i>

34:10.182 --> 34:11.848
<i>he could be a part of my life.</i>

34:11.850 --> 34:13.183
I'm nervous but I'm excited.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.519
This trip is everything.

34:16.187 --> 34:17.421
<i>Yeah, it's the true test.</i>

34:18.523 --> 34:19.623
I'm ready.

34:19.625 --> 34:20.857
Girls, let's go.

34:20.859 --> 34:22.993
Girls, did you get
your swimsuits?

34:22.995 --> 34:24.394

You guys excited?

34:30.235 --> 34:31.902

34:31.904 --> 34:33.236
We're going to Miami.

34:33.771 --> 34:36.106
[vocalizing]

34:36.108 --> 34:37.007
Go for the club music.

34:37.009 --> 34:38.008

34:38.010 --> 34:39.409
[beatboxing]

34:39.977 --> 34:40.510
Yeah.

34:40.512 --> 34:41.878
[beatboxing]

34:41.880 --> 34:43.513
Get it, Aspen. Yeah.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.215
Miami, baby. Here we come.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.116
[exclaims]

34:46.118 --> 34:47.217
Yeah.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.485
Enjoy yourselves.

34:49.153 --> 34:50.754
Have a good trip.

34:50.756 --> 34:53.190
I will absolutely
miss you girls.

34:53.192 --> 34:59.129
[Aspen] Aw Grandpa.
Hugs for Grandpa.

34:59.131 --> 35:00.363
I'm not sure I'll miss her.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.164
[all laughing]

35:01.166 --> 35:02.232
Cute.

35:02.234 --> 35:03.166
Okay, come get in here.

35:03.168 --> 35:04.067
[laughing]

35:04.069 --> 35:04.801
Bring it in.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.136
Yeah, family love.

35:08.172 --> 35:09.573
- [Darcey] No, it's okay.
- [Georgi] No, it's not.

35:09.575 --> 35:10.607
[exhales]

35:10.609 --> 35:12.742
- [Aniko] Let's get going.
- [Darcey] Yeah, let's go.

35:12.744 --> 35:14.978
- [Mike] You all set?
- [Darcey] We don't wanna miss the flight.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.108
- [Darcey] Miami, baby.
- [Stacey] Yes.

35:47.945 --> 35:49.379
That's what I'm talking about.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.014
We're back in Miami, Darce.

35:51.016 --> 35:53.016
We're gonna put on
a hell of a show.

35:53.018 --> 35:54.885
Get this party started.

35:54.887 --> 35:56.019
<i>If our show fails,</i>

35:56.021 --> 35:57.821
<i>that could ruin our company.</i>

35:57.823 --> 35:58.922
There's a lot of risk,

35:58.924 --> 36:02.192
and I don't want my daughters
to see me fail.

36:03.494 --> 36:05.495
Hold on,
I'm stuck to the leather.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.068
Miami, here we come.
High five!

36:12.070 --> 36:13.270
High five, Aniko.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.639
Hey!

36:15.641 --> 36:18.842
Georgi's over there,
on his phone.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.178
Hey babe, ready for
some fun in the sun?

36:31.856 --> 36:32.489
Whoo!

36:33.057 --> 36:33.957
Hi, Miami.

36:33.959 --> 36:35.058
Yeah.

36:35.060 --> 36:36.159
Are you guys excited?

36:36.161 --> 36:37.227
Yeah.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.995
Feel that Miami heat.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.063
Smoking hot.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.167
- We're back in Miami, Darce.
- We're back at Miami.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.902
Feels good, and we're
gonna put on, a hell of a show.

36:45.904 --> 36:47.871
We're excited for it.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.140
-[Stacey] I just felt chills. Do you feel those chills?
-[Darcey] Yeah.

36:52.710 --> 36:55.078
So I'm ready to go to the villa.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.413
Let's get this party started.

36:57.281 --> 36:59.115
Wow!

36:59.117 --> 37:00.417
Wow, look.

37:02.019 --> 37:04.221
What do you think of Miami?
It's great, right?

37:08.426 --> 37:10.227
Palm trees.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.432
You know, I feel like every time Darcey
and I come here, good things happen.

37:18.069 --> 37:21.071
It's beautiful.
I think you're gonna like it.

37:24.208 --> 37:25.408
[Stacey] Here we are.

37:26.110 --> 37:28.511
[Darcey] Thank you, my love.

37:28.513 --> 37:31.147
Hold on,
I'm stuck to the leather.

37:31.149 --> 37:33.216
- [Stacey] Ow.
- [Aniko] Come on, Mom.

37:33.317 --> 37:34.851
That hurt.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.019
Miami baby.

37:36.687 --> 37:40.357
[all cheering]

37:41.058 --> 37:42.726
[Stacey] A hoot and a holler!

37:42.728 --> 37:43.927
[Aniko] They have a pool.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.996
[Darcey] That's what
I'm talking about.

37:46.163 --> 37:47.163
First come, first serve,

37:47.165 --> 37:48.164
for the rooms?

37:48.166 --> 37:49.199
Wait for Mommy!

37:49.900 --> 37:51.768
[yelling]

37:51.770 --> 37:52.869
[laughing]

37:52.871 --> 37:54.938
Wait for Mommy [laughs]

37:54.940 --> 37:56.973
<i>[Darcey] The villa is beautiful.</i>

37:56.975 --> 37:58.875
<i>It's so Miami,</i>

37:58.877 --> 38:03.713
<i>it has a beautiful pool, has
plenty of rooms for all of us.</i>

38:03.715 --> 38:06.016
So we're not stepping
on each other's toes.

38:06.150 --> 38:07.717
<i>And we like our closets.</i>

38:07.719 --> 38:11.221
Not just for storing clothes.

38:11.223 --> 38:13.156
We all know what
goes down there.

38:13.791 --> 38:15.091
Oh, yeah.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.661
- [Stacey] It's a baby pool.
- [Aspen] I like it.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.896
- [Stacey] It's nice though.
- [Darcey] We have to get our tan on.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.499
-[Stacey] at night with some
candles, -[Darcey] Yeah.

38:22.501 --> 38:23.633
Put your feet in there.

38:23.635 --> 38:26.069
Get them kankles,
it helps the kankles.

38:27.872 --> 38:30.674
- [Darcey] My jeans.
- [Stacey] We can't bend down.

38:30.676 --> 38:34.044
Every time me and Darcey fly,
we puff up.

38:34.046 --> 38:38.081
We get puffy faces,
puffy ankles.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.382
We call 'em kankles.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.418
It never fails.

38:42.019 --> 38:43.386
Aw.

38:43.754 --> 38:46.122
-[Stacey] Thank you. Yeah. Oh [bleep].
-[Darcey] they are swollen.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.123
[Georgi] From the airplane.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.225
- [Darcey] Help the other foot.
- [Stacey] Oh, God.

38:49.227 --> 38:52.162
Alright. Thank you Georgi,
that, whoa!

39:04.141 --> 39:05.241
That's my chair.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.144
Oh, wow.

39:08.146 --> 39:11.247
Alright, I like this Georgi.
Keep it coming.

39:19.323 --> 39:19.956
What's he doing?

39:19.958 --> 39:21.958
What's he up to?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.294
-[Darcey] He's trying to impress
us, Stacey -[Stacey] Yeah I know.

39:25.062 --> 39:27.597
[all screaming]

39:27.599 --> 39:29.866
No.

39:29.868 --> 39:31.968
- [Darcey] We lost a tooth like that when we were kids.
- [Stacey] Oh, my God.

39:32.035 --> 39:33.203
Stop.

39:33.205 --> 39:35.338
- [Stacey] Not we, I did!
- [Darcey] Yes, she did.

39:35.340 --> 39:36.673
[Stacey] She's still guilty.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.208
[laughing]

39:38.210 --> 39:39.743
I don't want that hose
swinging near me

39:39.745 --> 39:41.344
because when I was, like, 12,

39:41.346 --> 39:43.646
my brother was playing
with the hose, just like that,

39:43.648 --> 39:48.818
and it accidentally hit me in the
mouth and it cracked my front tooth.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.087
You gotta be careful around
hoses so you don't chip a tooth.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.990
[Stacey] That feels good.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.259
- [Georgi] You have to clean your feet.
- [Stacey] What's she talking--

39:56.261 --> 39:57.427
Yeah, clean her...

39:58.295 --> 40:00.096
[all laughing]

40:01.499 --> 40:05.235
[Stacey] Eww, [bleep] look at her legs
jiggling like that. You just had surgery.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.204
I'm sure you'll like it.

40:08.206 --> 40:12.142
[Stacey] Oh, it feels good.
It feels like a, massage.

40:12.144 --> 40:13.443
Oh, it helps the kankles.

40:14.545 --> 40:17.580
- [Darcey] Stace, look at Giorgi.
- [Stacey] Okay.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.350
- [Darcey] He's really tryna' get into your good side there.
- [Stacey] Yeah.

40:20.352 --> 40:23.052
I could see that, that's nice.
I appreciate that.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.788
Trying to help those kankles.

40:24.790 --> 40:29.659
Baby steps, you know,
so far so good, but

40:29.661 --> 40:31.294
it's a little too early to tell.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.664
Thank you Giorgi,
that was sweet.

40:34.666 --> 40:37.033
Aww, sister love.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.971
<i>Being back in Miami with Giorgi
and my family, feels amazing.</i>

40:42.473 --> 40:44.107
<i>Everyone's getting along.</i>

40:44.109 --> 40:46.876
<i>I'm, you know, really happy
that we're all here together.</i>

40:46.878 --> 40:48.077
But personally and
professionally,

40:48.079 --> 40:50.447
there's a lot happening
right now

40:50.981 --> 40:53.783
and, there's a lot at risk.

40:53.785 --> 40:57.086
<i>This fashion show
is a huge deal.</i>

40:57.088 --> 40:59.322
<i>I'm starting to feel nervous
about what's to come.</i>

41:00.791 --> 41:04.027
If our show fails, that could
ruin our company.

41:04.029 --> 41:08.331
And honestly, I don't want
my daughters to see me fail.

41:13.571 --> 41:14.938
Here we go!

41:15.139 --> 41:17.707
I just want you guys to hold on
because now we're going to the sea.

41:17.709 --> 41:19.909
Whoa.
[laughs]

41:19.911 --> 41:22.412
I'm a little nauseous I
thought we were supposed to...

41:22.414 --> 41:25.982
[screams]

41:26.851 --> 41:30.053
So, Giorgi, now that we're trapped
in this boat in the middle of the ocean,

41:30.055 --> 41:34.257
are you in it for love, or
are you in it for the money?

41:35.559 --> 41:36.993
<i>My Mom got taken advantage of
so many times,</i>

41:36.995 --> 41:40.129
and that is not gonna happen
again, not on my watch.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.766
- [Stacey] Is this good?
- [Florian] Where are you going?

41:43.768 --> 41:45.268
I'm going to the
business meeting.

41:46.270 --> 41:48.304
I'm going to see Mike,
it's at a bar.

41:49.974 --> 41:53.309
It's just crazy, I'm not gonna
let his jealousy get in the way.

41:56.080 --> 41:57.413
Oh, my God, a curfew now?

41:59.783 --> 42:02.252
O-M Silva!

42:04.488 --> 42:06.489
[Darcey] <i>We met Michael
when we first went to LA</i>

42:06.491 --> 42:09.759
and he knows that we want
true love and true success in life.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.895
[Michael] Are you happy, 'cause
I see some Instagram [bleep].

42:11.897 --> 42:14.130
Darcey pays for everything,
she pays for the rent,

42:14.132 --> 42:16.065
takes him shopping,
buys the food.

42:16.067 --> 42:20.870
I wanna see Darcey and Stacey
with guys that treat the like goddesses.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.573
So I'm not happy, I wanna know
what's going on.

42:23.575 --> 42:25.375
When do I get to meet your boys?

42:25.377 --> 42:27.176
I wanna know the guys
that are dating my girls.
