00:35.104 --> 00:36.729
Pick a color.

00:37.564 --> 00:41.067
- Blue.
- B-L-U-E. Pick a number.

00:42.778 --> 00:45.696
- Eight.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:45.906 --> 00:48.366
Pick one more number.

00:48.909 --> 00:50.910
- Fifteen.
- 1, 2, 3, 4...

00:51.120 --> 00:55.206
...5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15.

00:55.415 --> 00:57.375
Pick another number.

00:57.709 --> 01:00.169
- Six.
- Okay.

01:04.174 --> 01:07.218
"Dream is destiny."

02:50.447 --> 02:52.281
Rock out.

02:52.866 --> 02:54.700
Rock 'n' roll.

02:57.621 --> 03:00.456
Low strings. Begin!

03:32.322 --> 03:35.366
Sara, try that thing
you asked me about.

03:35.617 --> 03:39.537
- Will you try it more subdued?
- Okay.

03:39.746 --> 03:42.290
- Try it, see what you think.
- That one?

03:42.499 --> 03:46.877
But I want it to sound rich
and almost a little wavy...

03:47.087 --> 03:49.463
...due to being a bit out of tune.

03:49.673 --> 03:51.966
- You want it...
- Slightly detached.

03:52.217 --> 03:54.176
That's what I was wondering.

03:54.678 --> 03:55.678
We're going:

03:58.140 --> 04:00.182
- Yeah. You got it.
- Okay.

04:00.517 --> 04:02.643
Snazzy, people!

04:02.853 --> 04:05.813
Okay, pickup to 20, please.

04:06.023 --> 04:08.065
- This is the pickup to 20.
- Okay.

04:08.275 --> 04:09.900
One, two, three.

05:07.793 --> 05:10.711
Hey, it's me.
I just got back into town.

05:10.921 --> 05:14.048
I thought I'd bum a ride,
but that's cool.

05:14.257 --> 05:17.927
I can just take a cab,
something like that.

05:20.514 --> 05:24.141
I guess I'll hang out with you later
or something.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.989
Ahoy there, matey!
You in for the long haul?

05:39.366 --> 05:42.368
Do you need a lift on down the line?

05:42.786 --> 05:46.872
I was waiting for a cab, but...

05:47.082 --> 05:50.167
All right. Don't miss the boat.

05:51.753 --> 05:54.130
- Hey, thanks.
- Not a problem.

05:54.339 --> 05:56.799
Anchors aweigh!

06:01.012 --> 06:03.055
What do you think of my vessel?

06:03.265 --> 06:06.892
She's "see-worthy." S-E-E.
See with your eyes.

06:07.102 --> 06:11.397
My transport should be an extension
of my personality. VoilÃ !

06:11.606 --> 06:16.444
And this is my window to the world.
Every minute's a different show.

06:16.653 --> 06:19.780
I may not understand it
or agree with it...

06:20.031 --> 06:23.617
...but I accept it
and just sort of glide along.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.454
Keep things on an even keel, I say.

06:26.663 --> 06:30.166
Go with the flow.
The sea refuses no river.

06:30.375 --> 06:35.463
The idea is to remain in a state
of departure, while always arriving.

06:35.714 --> 06:38.507
It saves on introductions
and goodbyes.

06:38.717 --> 06:41.969
The ride requires no explanation,
just occupants.

06:42.179 --> 06:44.096
That's where you come in.

06:44.306 --> 06:48.434
It's like you come onto this planet
with a crayon box.

06:48.643 --> 06:52.480
You may get the eight-pack
or the 16-pack...

06:52.689 --> 06:57.735
...but it's all in what you do with
the crayons, the colors you're given.

06:57.986 --> 07:01.155
Don't worry about coloring
within the lines.

07:01.364 --> 07:05.576
Color outside the lines
and off the page! Don't box me in!

07:05.827 --> 07:10.331
We're in motion to the ocean.
We are not landlocked!

07:10.540 --> 07:12.666
So where do you want out?

07:13.043 --> 07:17.546
Who, me? Am I first? I don't know.
Really, anywhere is fine.

07:17.964 --> 07:21.550
- Just give me an address, okay?
- Uh...

07:21.927 --> 07:24.845
Tell you what.
Go up three more streets.

07:25.055 --> 07:30.267
Take a right. Go two more blocks.
Drop him off on the next corner.

07:32.229 --> 07:33.395
Where's that?

07:34.064 --> 07:36.357
I don't know, but it's somewhere.

07:36.566 --> 07:40.861
And it'll determine the course
of the rest of your life.

07:41.655 --> 07:44.198
All ashore that's going ashore!

07:44.407 --> 07:45.449
Toot, toot.

09:13.538 --> 09:17.666
I refuse to take existentialism
as just another fashion...

09:17.876 --> 09:19.835
...or historical curiosity...

09:20.086 --> 09:24.965
...because it has something important
to offer for the new century.

09:25.425 --> 09:29.845
I'm afraid we're losing the real
virtues of living life passionately...

09:30.055 --> 09:33.098
...taking responsibility
for who you are...

09:33.308 --> 09:37.311
...making something of yourself
and feeling good about life.

09:37.687 --> 09:42.107
Existentialism is often discussed
as a philosophy of despair...

09:42.317 --> 09:44.526
...but I think it's the opposite.

09:44.778 --> 09:49.657
Sartre once said he never really
felt a day of despair in his life.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.951
One thing that comes
from these guys...

09:53.161 --> 09:56.580
...is not a sense of anguish
so much as...

09:56.790 --> 09:59.249
...an exuberance of feeling
on top of it.

09:59.501 --> 10:03.170
It's like your life
is yours to create.

10:03.421 --> 10:07.925
I've read
the postmodernists with interest.

10:08.802 --> 10:12.638
But I always have this awful,
nagging feeling...

10:12.847 --> 10:15.599
...that something essential
is left out.

10:15.850 --> 10:19.144
The more you talk about a person...

10:19.437 --> 10:23.857
...as a social construction
or a confluence of forces...

10:24.067 --> 10:27.152
...or as fragmented or marginalized...

10:27.362 --> 10:31.031
...then you open up
a whole new world of excuses.

10:31.241 --> 10:35.744
When Sartre talks about
responsibility, it's not abstract.

10:35.954 --> 10:40.249
It's not the kind of self or soul
that theologians argue about.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.752
It's something concrete.
It's us talking...

10:43.962 --> 10:47.631
...making decisions
and taking the consequences.

10:48.174 --> 10:51.552
There are six billion
people in the world.

10:51.970 --> 10:55.013
Nevertheless, what you do
makes a difference.

10:55.223 --> 11:00.018
It makes a difference
in material terms and to other people.

11:00.228 --> 11:02.187
It sets an example.

11:02.439 --> 11:06.275
The message is, we should
never write ourselves off...

11:06.484 --> 11:10.404
...and see ourselves as victims
of various forces.

11:10.655 --> 11:13.991
It's always our decision who we are.

11:23.501 --> 11:26.211
Creation comes out of imperfection.

11:26.421 --> 11:31.842
It seems to come out of a striving
and a frustration.

11:32.051 --> 11:35.137
This is where, I think,
language came from.

11:35.346 --> 11:40.726
I mean, it came from our desire
to transcend our isolation...

11:40.935 --> 11:44.688
...and have some connection
with one another.

11:44.898 --> 11:48.817
It had to be easy when
it was just simple survival.

11:49.068 --> 11:52.112
"Water." We came up
with a sound for that.

11:52.322 --> 11:55.449
"Tiger behind you!"
We made a sound for that.

11:55.700 --> 11:59.578
But when it gets really
interesting, I think...

11:59.788 --> 12:04.583
...is when we use
that same system of symbols...

12:04.876 --> 12:10.255
...to communicate all the abstract and
intangible things we're experiencing.

12:10.465 --> 12:15.427
What is "frustration"?
Or what is "anger" or "love"?

12:15.637 --> 12:18.013
When I say "love"...

12:18.264 --> 12:22.726
...the sound comes out of my mouth
and hits the other person's ear...

12:22.936 --> 12:27.356
...travels through this byzantine
conduit in their brain...

12:27.565 --> 12:31.485
...through their memories of love
or lack of love.

12:31.736 --> 12:37.658
They say they understand, but how
do I know? Because words are inert.

12:37.867 --> 12:41.203
They're just symbols. They're dead.
You know?

12:41.454 --> 12:45.916
And so much of our experience
is intangible.

12:46.125 --> 12:51.088
So much of what we perceive cannot
be expressed. It's unspeakable.

12:51.506 --> 12:56.009
And yet, you know, when we
communicate with one another...

12:58.388 --> 13:02.808
...and we feel we have connected
and think we're understood...

13:03.017 --> 13:07.729
...I think we have a feeling
of almost spiritual communion.

13:07.981 --> 13:12.025
That feeling may be transient,
but it's what we live for.

13:23.162 --> 13:27.249
To look at human development,
look at the organism's evolution...

13:27.458 --> 13:30.210
...and his environmental interaction.

13:30.420 --> 13:35.549
Evolution of the organism begins
with evolution through the hominid...

13:35.800 --> 13:39.970
...coming to the evolution of man.
Neanderthal, Cro-Magnon.

13:40.179 --> 13:44.016
Now, what you're looking at here
are three strings:

13:44.225 --> 13:47.978
Biological, anthropological,
development of cultures...

13:48.229 --> 13:51.732
...and cultural,
which is human expression.

13:51.941 --> 13:56.528
What you've seen is the evolution
of populations, not individuals.

13:56.738 --> 13:59.531
Then look at the time scale involved.

13:59.741 --> 14:04.536
Two billion years for life,
six million for the hominid...

14:04.746 --> 14:07.915
...100,000 years for mankind
as we know it.

14:08.124 --> 14:11.126
You see how the evolutionary
paradigm telescopes.

14:11.336 --> 14:17.299
Then when you get to agriculture,
scientific and industrial revolution...

14:17.508 --> 14:21.178
...you're looking at 10,000 years,
400 years, 150 years.

14:21.429 --> 14:24.806
You see a further telescoping
of evolutionary time.

14:25.058 --> 14:27.684
As we go through the new evolution...

14:27.894 --> 14:33.899
...it will telescope to the point
where we see it within our lifetime.

14:34.150 --> 14:38.278
The new evolution stems
from two types of information:

14:38.488 --> 14:41.907
Digital and analog.
Digital is artificial intelligence.

14:42.158 --> 14:45.577
Analog results from molecular biology
and cloning.

14:45.787 --> 14:48.246
You knit the two with neurobiology.

14:48.498 --> 14:53.168
Under the old paradigm, one would
die, the other would dominate.

14:53.378 --> 14:57.381
Under the new paradigm, they exist
as a supportive...

14:57.590 --> 15:01.843
...non-competitive grouping,
independent from the external.

15:02.095 --> 15:06.306
So evolution now becomes an
individually centered process...

15:06.683 --> 15:09.476
...emanating from the individual...

15:09.644 --> 15:14.856
...not a passive process with the
individual at the collective's whim.

15:15.149 --> 15:17.859
So you produce a neo-human...

15:18.069 --> 15:21.238
...with a new individuality,
a new consciousness.

15:21.447 --> 15:24.574
That's only the beginning
of the cycle.

15:24.784 --> 15:28.537
As it proceeds,
the input is this new intelligence.

15:28.746 --> 15:32.666
As intelligence piles on intelligence,
ability on ability...

15:32.875 --> 15:36.044
...the speed changes until you reach
a crescendo.

15:36.254 --> 15:42.300
Imagine it as an instant fulfillment
of human and neo-human potential.

15:42.510 --> 15:46.096
It could be the amplification
of the individual...

15:46.305 --> 15:50.142
...the multiplication of individual,
parallel existences...

15:50.309 --> 15:54.604
...with the individual no longer
restricted by time and space.

15:54.814 --> 15:58.900
And the manifestations of this
neo-human evolution...

15:59.110 --> 16:02.279
...could be dramatically
counterintuitive.

16:02.488 --> 16:06.950
The old evolution is cold,
it's sterile. It's efficient.

16:07.160 --> 16:10.120
Its manifestations are
those of social adaption.

16:10.371 --> 16:15.000
You're talking about parasitism,
dominance, morality...

16:15.251 --> 16:16.835
...war, predation.

16:17.086 --> 16:21.298
These will be subject to de-emphasis
and de-evolution.

16:21.507 --> 16:25.010
The new paradigm would give us
the traits...

16:25.261 --> 16:29.264
...of truth, loyalty,
justice and freedom.

16:29.515 --> 16:34.936
These would be manifestations of
this evolution. That's what we hope.

18:24.755 --> 18:30.093
Self-destructive man feels completely
alienated. Utterly alone.

18:30.303 --> 18:32.762
He's an outsider to the community.

18:32.972 --> 18:36.266
He thinks to himself,
"I must be insane."

18:36.517 --> 18:40.562
What he fails to realize
is that society has, as he does...

18:40.813 --> 18:44.858
...an interest in considerable
losses, in catastrophes.

18:45.067 --> 18:49.279
Wars, famines, floods and quakes
meet well-defined needs.

18:53.826 --> 18:57.787
Man wants chaos.
In fact, he's gotta have it.

18:57.997 --> 19:02.626
Depression, strife, riots, murder.
All this dread.

19:02.835 --> 19:08.506
We're drawn to that almost orgiastic
state created out of destruction.

19:08.716 --> 19:11.968
It's in all of us. We revel in it.

19:14.013 --> 19:19.142
The media puts a sad face on things,
painting them as human tragedies.

19:19.477 --> 19:24.689
But the media's function is not
to eliminate the evils of the world.

19:24.899 --> 19:29.861
They persuade us to accept those evils
and get used to living with them.

19:30.071 --> 19:33.823
The powers that be
want us to be passive observers.

19:34.450 --> 19:36.534
Have you got a match?

19:38.287 --> 19:42.499
They haven't given us any other
options, outside the occasional...

19:42.708 --> 19:46.795
...purely symbolic,
participatory act of "voting."

19:47.004 --> 19:51.716
Do you want the puppet on the right
or the puppet on the left?

19:51.968 --> 19:56.471
The time has come to project my
inadequacies and dissatisfactions...

19:56.722 --> 20:00.642
...into the sociopolitical
and scientific schemes.

20:00.893 --> 20:04.396
Let my own lack of a voice be heard.

21:09.211 --> 21:11.755
I keep thinking about
something you said.

21:12.006 --> 21:14.215
- Something I said?
- Yeah.

21:14.550 --> 21:17.552
About feeling like you
observe your life...

21:17.720 --> 21:21.890
...from the perspective of
an old woman about to die. Remember?

21:22.058 --> 21:25.477
Yeah. I still feel that way sometimes.

21:25.728 --> 21:28.104
Like I'm looking back on my life.

21:28.356 --> 21:30.899
Like my waking life is her memories.

21:31.108 --> 21:33.068
Exactly.

21:34.070 --> 21:37.906
I heard that Tim Leary said
as he was dying...

21:38.115 --> 21:42.535
...he looked forward to when his
body was dead but his brain was alive.

21:42.745 --> 21:48.166
Those six to 12 minutes of brain
activity after everything shuts down.

21:48.376 --> 21:54.214
And a second of dream consciousness
is infinitely longer than a waking one.

21:54.465 --> 21:56.007
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah.

21:56.425 --> 21:59.928
Like, I wake up at 10:12.
Then I go back to sleep...

22:00.179 --> 22:05.767
...and have long, intricate dreams that
seem hours long. Then I wake up and...

22:05.935 --> 22:07.018
...it's 10:13.

22:07.269 --> 22:12.482
Exactly. So in that six to 12 minutes
of brain activity...

22:12.691 --> 22:14.526
...that could be your life.

22:14.735 --> 22:19.155
You are that woman,
looking back over everything.

22:19.365 --> 22:22.200
If I am? What would you be in that?

22:22.368 --> 22:23.868
Whatever I am now.

22:24.078 --> 22:27.414
I mean, maybe I only exist
in your mind.

22:27.581 --> 22:31.292
I'm still just as real
as anything else.

22:32.336 --> 22:33.711
Yeah.

22:34.422 --> 22:36.965
I've been thinking about
something you said.

22:37.133 --> 22:38.133
What's that?

22:38.342 --> 22:43.304
About reincarnation, and where
all the new souls come from over time.

22:43.764 --> 22:45.265
Everybody always...

22:45.516 --> 22:50.979
...says they're the reincarnation
of Cleopatra or Alexander the Great.

22:51.188 --> 22:54.315
You know they were a dumb fuck
like everyone else.

22:54.525 --> 22:56.401
I mean, it's impossible.

22:56.652 --> 23:01.322
The world population has doubled
in the past 40 years.

23:01.532 --> 23:06.411
- So if you believe in one eternal soul...
- Uh-huh.

23:06.745 --> 23:10.331
...you have a 50% chance of your soul
being over 40.

23:10.624 --> 23:16.129
For it to be over 150 years old,
it's only one out of six.

23:16.338 --> 23:21.468
Are you saying reincarnation doesn't
exist? Or we're all young souls?

23:21.677 --> 23:25.430
- Half of us are first-round humans?
- No, no.

23:25.639 --> 23:28.057
- What I'm saying...
- What's your point?

23:28.350 --> 23:32.812
I believe reincarnation
is a poetic expression...

23:33.022 --> 23:35.231
...of what collective memory is.

23:35.441 --> 23:39.527
- I read an article by a biochemist.
- Right.

23:39.778 --> 23:43.156
He said when a member
of a species is born...

23:43.365 --> 23:47.118
...it has a billion years
of memory to draw on.

23:47.453 --> 23:50.955
This is where we inherit
our instincts.

23:51.248 --> 23:53.541
I like that. Like there's...

23:53.751 --> 23:57.670
...this telepathic thing going on
that we're a part of...

23:57.922 --> 24:02.634
...whether we're conscious of it
or not. That would explain these...

24:02.885 --> 24:08.431
...seemingly spontaneous, worldwide,
innovative leaps in science and art.

24:08.641 --> 24:13.853
Like the same results popping up
everywhere, independent of each other.

24:14.146 --> 24:18.066
A guy on a computer figures something
out and simultaneously...

24:18.275 --> 24:21.569
...a bunch of people
figure out the same thing.

24:21.779 --> 24:25.865
They did this study.
They isolated a group over time...

24:26.075 --> 24:30.245
...and they monitored their abilities
at crossword puzzles...

24:30.454 --> 24:32.914
- Uh-huh.
...in relation to the population.

24:33.165 --> 24:39.087
Then they secretly gave them a day-old
crossword. One already done by people.

24:39.296 --> 24:42.257
Their scores went up dramatically.
Like 20%.

24:42.466 --> 24:47.804
It's like once the answers are out
there, people can pick up on them.

24:48.013 --> 24:52.267
It's like we're all telepathically
sharing our experiences.

25:14.873 --> 25:18.209
I'll get you fuckers
if it's the last thing I do.

25:18.460 --> 25:21.796
You're gonna pay
for what you did to me.

25:22.381 --> 25:27.051
For every second I spend
in this hellhole...

25:27.261 --> 25:31.180
...I'll see you spend a year
in living hell!

25:32.808 --> 25:36.894
You fucks will beg me to let you die.
But no, not yet.

25:37.104 --> 25:39.564
I want you cocksuckers to suffer.

25:40.065 --> 25:44.652
I'll fix your asses.
Maybe a long needle in your eardrum.

25:45.988 --> 25:48.114
Or a hot cigar in your eye.

25:48.407 --> 25:49.949
Nothing fancy.

25:50.993 --> 25:54.120
Some molten lead up the ass?

25:56.123 --> 26:01.002
Or, better still,
some of that old Apache shit.

26:01.295 --> 26:04.005
Cut your eyelids off.

26:05.507 --> 26:08.635
I'll just listen to you fucks
screaming.

26:09.428 --> 26:11.346
What sweet music that'll be.

26:12.306 --> 26:14.307
We'll do it in the hospital...

26:14.516 --> 26:18.936
...with doctors and nurses,
so you pricks don't die too quick.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.147
You know the best part?

26:21.357 --> 26:25.610
The best part is you faggots
will have your eyelids cut off...

26:25.819 --> 26:30.156
...so you'll have to watch me
do it to you.

26:31.450 --> 26:37.622
You'll see me bring that cigar closer
and closer to your wide-open eye...

26:38.874 --> 26:44.087
...till you're almost
out of your mind. But not quite.

26:44.338 --> 26:49.550
I want it to last a long, long time.

26:50.636 --> 26:55.973
I want you to know it's me.
I'm the one doing it to you. Me!

26:56.684 --> 27:02.146
That sissy psychiatrist,
what unmitigated ignorance!

27:02.356 --> 27:06.693
And that old drunken fart of a judge.
What a pompous ass!

27:07.027 --> 27:10.321
Judge not, lest ye be judged!

27:10.531 --> 27:15.910
All of you pukes are gonna die
the day I get out of this shithole!

27:19.957 --> 27:25.044
I guarantee you'll regret
the day you met me!

27:25.671 --> 27:30.133
In today's world-view,
science has taken the place of God...

27:30.342 --> 27:33.928
...but some philosophical
problems are still troubling.

27:34.138 --> 27:35.680
Take free will.

27:35.889 --> 27:39.809
This problem has been around
since Aristotle, in 350 B.C.

27:40.018 --> 27:44.522
St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas
worried how we can be free...

27:44.732 --> 27:47.108
...if God already knows
what we're gonna do.

27:47.609 --> 27:52.238
Nowadays, we know the world works
by fundamental physical laws.

27:52.448 --> 27:57.076
These laws govern the behavior
of every object in the world.

27:57.286 --> 28:02.999
Since these laws are trustworthy, they
enable technological achievements.

28:03.208 --> 28:08.421
We're physical systems too. Complex
arrangements of carbon, mostly water.

28:08.630 --> 28:11.674
Our behavior isn't an
exception to these laws.

28:11.925 --> 28:16.888
So whether it's God setting things up
in advance and knowing everything...

28:17.139 --> 28:21.642
...or physical laws governing us,
there's not much room for freedom.

28:21.852 --> 28:25.605
You might want to ignore
the mystery of free will.

28:25.856 --> 28:29.400
To say, "It's a historical
anecdote, it's sophomoric.

28:29.693 --> 28:32.945
It's a question with no answer.
Forget about it."

28:33.155 --> 28:38.284
But the question remains. If you think
about individuality, who you are...

28:38.494 --> 28:43.372
...is based on the free choices
you make. Or take responsibility.

28:43.582 --> 28:47.335
You're only held responsible
or admired or respected...

28:47.544 --> 28:50.338
...for things you do
of your own free will.

28:50.547 --> 28:54.050
The question keeps coming
and we have no solution.

28:54.259 --> 28:56.385
Decisions can seem like charades.

28:56.595 --> 29:00.890
Imagine it. There's electrical
activity in the brain. Neurons fire...

29:01.099 --> 29:06.604
...sending a signal through the nerves
into the muscle fibers. They twitch.

29:06.814 --> 29:10.483
You reach out your arm.
It looks like a free action...

29:10.734 --> 29:13.778
...but every part of that process...

29:13.987 --> 29:18.866
...is governed by physical laws.
Chemical, electrical, and so on.

29:19.076 --> 29:22.495
It looks like the big bang
set the initial conditions...

29:22.704 --> 29:25.706
...and the whole
rest of human history...

29:25.958 --> 29:30.920
...is the reaction of subatomic
particles to basic physical laws.

29:31.129 --> 29:34.465
We think we're special,
we have dignity.

29:34.716 --> 29:38.636
That now is threatened.
It's challenged by this picture.

29:38.846 --> 29:43.808
You might say, "What about quantum
mechanics? I know enough...

29:44.017 --> 29:46.769
...to know it's a
probabilistic theory.

29:46.979 --> 29:51.065
It's loose, not deterministic.
It lets us understand free will."

29:51.275 --> 29:54.402
But if you look at details
it won't really help...

29:54.611 --> 29:59.156
...because you have quantum particles,
and their behavior is random.

29:59.408 --> 30:02.910
They sort of swerve.
Their behavior is absurd...

30:03.161 --> 30:08.124
...and unpredictable. We can't
study it based on what came before.

30:08.375 --> 30:10.126
It has a probabilistic framework.

30:10.335 --> 30:13.754
Is freedom just
a matter of probabilities?

30:14.006 --> 30:16.132
Randomness in a chaotic system?

30:16.383 --> 30:20.970
I'd rather be a gear in
a deterministic, physical machine...

30:21.263 --> 30:23.347
...than some random swerving.

30:23.557 --> 30:29.437
We can't ignore the problem. We must
find room in our world-view for persons.

30:29.646 --> 30:33.774
Not just bodies, but persons.
There's the freedom problem...

30:33.984 --> 30:39.655
...find room for choice and responsibility
and understanding individuality.

30:39.865 --> 30:42.074
"You can't fight city hall."

30:42.284 --> 30:46.203
"Death and taxes." "Don't talk about
politics or religion."

30:46.455 --> 30:50.374
This is all the equivalent
of enemy propaganda.

30:50.626 --> 30:52.752
Lay down, G.I! Lay down, G.I!

30:53.003 --> 30:58.132
We saw it in the 20th century. Now, in
the 21st century, we must realize...

30:58.383 --> 31:01.469
...that we cannot be crammed
into this rat maze.

31:01.637 --> 31:04.055
We should not submit
to dehumanization!

31:04.264 --> 31:07.516
I'm concerned with what's
happening in this world.

31:07.726 --> 31:11.562
I'm concerned with structure,
the systems of control.

31:12.064 --> 31:16.359
Those who control my life and those
who seek to control it more!

31:16.568 --> 31:19.904
I want freedom!
And that's what you should want!

31:20.280 --> 31:25.159
It's up to each of us to turn loose
the greed, hatred, envy...

31:25.410 --> 31:30.790
...and insecurities, their mode of
control. We feel pathetic, small...

31:30.999 --> 31:35.795
...so we'll willingly give up our
sovereignty, liberty and destiny.

31:36.004 --> 31:39.924
We must realize we're being
conditioned on a mass scale.

31:40.175 --> 31:42.718
Challenge the corporate slave state!

31:42.928 --> 31:47.723
The 21st century is a new century.
Not the century of slavery...

31:47.933 --> 31:50.226
...lies and issues
of no significance...

31:50.435 --> 31:54.355
...and classism, statism
and other modes of control.

31:54.564 --> 31:59.360
It'll be an age of humankind standing
up for something pure and right.

31:59.736 --> 32:04.281
What a bunch of garbage. Liberal
Democrat, conservative Republican.

32:04.533 --> 32:06.492
Two sides of the same coin!

32:06.827 --> 32:09.036
Two management teams...

32:09.246 --> 32:12.498
...bidding for the CEO job
of Slavery, Inc!

32:12.708 --> 32:16.836
The truth is out there,
but they lay out a buffet of lies!

32:17.045 --> 32:20.256
I'm sick of it! And I'm not
gonna take a bite out of it!

32:20.465 --> 32:23.718
Resistance is not futile!
We will win this!

32:24.011 --> 32:26.971
Humankind is too good!
We're not underachievers!

32:27.139 --> 32:33.144
We'll stand up and be human beings!
We'll get fired up about real things!

32:33.353 --> 32:37.898
Creativity and the dynamic human
spirit that refuses to submit!

32:38.358 --> 32:42.403
Well, that's all I got to say.
It's in your court.

32:44.865 --> 32:48.409
The quest is to be
liberated from the negative...

32:48.618 --> 32:52.872
...which is really our
own will to nothingness.

32:53.081 --> 32:57.960
Once having said yes to the instant,
the affirmation is contagious.

32:58.170 --> 33:03.132
It bursts into a chain of affirmations
that knows no limit.

33:03.341 --> 33:07.011
To say yes to one instant...

33:07.220 --> 33:10.890
...is to say yes to all of existence.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.769
The main character is
what I call "the mind."

33:14.978 --> 33:18.230
Its mastery, its capacity
to represent.

33:18.482 --> 33:20.858
In history, attempts have been made...

33:21.109 --> 33:26.072
...to contain experiences which
happen at the edge of the limit...

33:26.281 --> 33:29.283
...where the mind is vulnerable.

33:29.618 --> 33:33.871
But I think we are in a very
significant moment in history.

33:34.247 --> 33:38.793
Those moments, those what we
might call liminal, limit, frontier...

33:39.002 --> 33:42.213
...X- zone experiences are
now becoming the norm.

33:42.422 --> 33:46.759
These multiplicities and distinctions
send differences, giving...

33:46.968 --> 33:51.138
...great difficulty to the old mind.

33:51.473 --> 33:54.517
And through entering into their
very essence...

33:54.726 --> 33:57.520
...tasting and feeling their
uniqueness...

33:57.771 --> 34:00.856
...one makes a breakthrough
to that common...

34:01.066 --> 34:04.568
...something that holds
them together.

34:04.945 --> 34:10.157
And so the main character
is to this new mind...

34:10.784 --> 34:13.077
...greater, greater mind.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.496
A mind that yet is to be.

34:15.871 --> 34:19.291
And when we enter into that mode...

34:19.501 --> 34:22.710
...you can see a radical subjectivity.

34:22.879 --> 34:27.049
Radical attunement to individuality,
uniqueness, to the mind.

34:27.300 --> 34:29.510
It opens itself to a vast objectivity.

34:29.761 --> 34:32.429
So the story is of the cosmos now.

34:32.889 --> 34:37.476
The moment is not just
a passing empty, nothing, yet...

34:37.726 --> 34:41.856
...this is the way in which
these secret passages happen.

34:42.065 --> 34:45.568
Yes, it's empty with such fullness...

34:46.820 --> 34:50.489
...that the great moment,
the great life...

34:50.739 --> 34:53.909
...of the universe is pulsating in it.

34:54.744 --> 34:58.664
And each one, each object,
each place...

34:58.874 --> 35:02.126
...each act, leaves mark.

35:02.586 --> 35:08.215
And that story is singular.
But, in fact, it's story after story.

35:13.763 --> 35:17.349
It dissolves into
quick-moving particles that swirl.

35:17.601 --> 35:21.854
Either I'm moving fast, or time is.
Never both simultaneously.

35:22.063 --> 35:24.607
It's such a strange paradox.

35:24.858 --> 35:28.694
I'm closer to the end of my life
than I've ever been...

35:28.904 --> 35:32.489
...but I feel more than ever that
I have all the time in the world.

35:32.741 --> 35:35.409
When I was younger,
there was a need for...

35:35.619 --> 35:38.787
...certainty. I had to get
to the end of the path.

35:38.997 --> 35:43.584
I know what you mean.
I remember thinking:

35:43.793 --> 35:47.463
Someday, in my mid-30s maybe...

35:47.672 --> 35:50.466
...everything's going to somehow
gel and settle.

35:50.675 --> 35:51.675
- Mm-hm.
- Just end.

35:51.927 --> 35:54.220
It was like there was a plateau...

35:54.471 --> 35:58.390
...waiting for me. I was climbing up.
When I got to the top...

35:58.600 --> 36:01.477
...all growth and change would stop.

36:01.645 --> 36:03.062
- Even exhilaration.
- Oh.

36:03.271 --> 36:06.023
But it hasn't happened,
thank goodness.

36:06.233 --> 36:10.236
In our youth, we don't take into
account our curiosity.

36:10.445 --> 36:12.029
That's what's great about being human.

36:12.197 --> 36:15.449
Yeah. You know what Benedict Anderson
says about identity?

36:15.659 --> 36:19.495
- No.
- He talks about, say, a baby picture.

36:19.746 --> 36:23.749
You pick up this two-dimensional image
and say, "That's me."

36:23.959 --> 36:28.754
To connect this baby in this weird
image with yourself in the present...

36:29.005 --> 36:30.881
...you have to make up a story.

36:31.091 --> 36:35.010
"This is me when I was a year old.
Later, I had long hair...

36:35.262 --> 36:38.555
...and then we moved to Riverdale,
and here I am."

36:38.765 --> 36:42.184
So it takes a story
that's actually a fiction...

36:42.435 --> 36:45.229
...to make you and the baby identical.

36:45.438 --> 36:48.357
- To create your identity.
- The funny thing is...

36:48.566 --> 36:52.152
...our cells completely
regenerate every seven years.

36:52.404 --> 36:55.114
We've been several different people.

36:55.532 --> 36:59.702
And yet, we always remain
quintessentially ourselves.

37:19.597 --> 37:24.226
Our critique began as all critiques
begin, with doubt.

37:24.602 --> 37:26.520
Doubt became our narrative.

37:26.813 --> 37:30.149
Ours was a quest for
a new story, our own.

37:30.358 --> 37:33.610
We grasped for this new history,
driven by suspicion...

37:33.820 --> 37:36.613
...that ordinary language
couldn't tell it.

37:36.823 --> 37:41.702
Our past appeared frozen in the
distance, and our every gesture...

37:41.911 --> 37:46.206
...signified negation of the old
world and the reach for a new one.

37:46.458 --> 37:50.878
How we lived created a new situation
of exuberance and friendship.

37:51.212 --> 37:55.424
A subversive micro-society
in the heart of an ignoring society.

37:55.800 --> 38:01.013
Art was not the goal, but the occasion
and method for locating our rhythm...

38:01.222 --> 38:03.515
...and buried possibilities
of our time.

38:03.767 --> 38:09.229
It was about the true discovery of
communication. Or the quest for such.

38:09.481 --> 38:11.482
Finding and losing it.

38:11.691 --> 38:14.485
We, the unappeased,
continued looking...

38:14.694 --> 38:17.821
...filling silences with
wishes, fears, fantasies.

38:18.114 --> 38:22.534
Driven on by the fact that no matter
how empty the world seemed...

38:22.702 --> 38:25.913
...no matter how
degraded and used-up...

38:26.122 --> 38:29.708
...anything was possible.
Given the right circumstances...

38:29.959 --> 38:33.379
...a new world was just
as likely as an old one.

38:48.978 --> 38:51.647
There are two kinds of sufferers:

38:51.898 --> 38:54.358
Those who suffer
from a lack of life...

38:54.609 --> 38:58.362
...and those who suffer from
an overabundance of life.

38:58.571 --> 39:02.408
I've always found myself
in the second category.

39:02.617 --> 39:07.162
When you think of it, almost all
human behavior and activity...

39:07.372 --> 39:10.791
...is essentially no different
from animal behavior.

39:11.042 --> 39:15.504
The most advanced technologies
and craftsmanship bring us at best...

39:15.713 --> 39:18.257
...up to the super-chimpanzee level.

39:18.508 --> 39:24.388
Actually, the gap between, say, Plato
or Nietzsche and the average human...

39:24.597 --> 39:28.851
...is greater than between that
chimpanzee and the average human.

39:29.060 --> 39:31.186
The realm of the real spirit...

39:31.438 --> 39:36.733
...the true artist, the saint, the
philosopher, is rarely achieved.

39:36.985 --> 39:38.777
Why so few?

39:39.195 --> 39:44.491
Why is world history and evolution
not stories of progress...

39:44.701 --> 39:47.995
...but an endless and futile
addition of zeros?

39:48.455 --> 39:51.582
No greater values have developed.

39:51.791 --> 39:56.295
Hell, the Greeks 3000 years
ago were just as advanced as we are.

39:56.546 --> 39:59.506
What are the barriers
that keep people...

39:59.674 --> 40:02.801
...from reaching anywhere near
their real potential?

40:03.011 --> 40:07.681
The answer to that can be found in
another question, and that's this:

40:07.891 --> 40:11.477
Which is the most universal
human characteristic?

40:11.686 --> 40:13.437
Fear...

40:13.938 --> 40:15.814
...or laziness?

40:26.868 --> 40:29.077
What are you writing?

40:31.956 --> 40:33.832
A novel.

40:35.418 --> 40:37.711
What's the story?

40:38.046 --> 40:41.089
There's no story. It's just...

40:41.341 --> 40:44.176
...people, gestures, moments.

40:44.385 --> 40:48.388
Bits of rapture. Fleeting emotions.

40:48.681 --> 40:50.641
In short...

40:51.309 --> 40:54.436
...the greatest stories ever told.

40:56.856 --> 40:59.107
Are you in the story?

41:01.402 --> 41:04.112
I don't think so.

41:04.322 --> 41:09.368
But then I'm kind of reading it
and then writing it.

41:13.706 --> 41:18.418
It was in the desert, the middle of
nowhere, on the way to Vegas.

41:18.670 --> 41:22.714
So you know, every once
in a while a car would stop for gas.

41:22.924 --> 41:26.134
It was the last gas stop before Vegas.

41:26.386 --> 41:31.598
There was a chair and a cash register.
That was all the room there was.

41:31.849 --> 41:35.769
I was asleep and I heard a noise.

41:35.979 --> 41:42.150
You know, just like in my mind.
So I got up...

41:43.528 --> 41:46.530
...and I walked out
and stood on the curb...

41:46.739 --> 41:50.158
...where the gas station ends.
You know, the driveway.

41:50.410 --> 41:54.079
I'm rubbing my eyes,
trying to see what's going on.

41:54.289 --> 42:00.460
And way down, at the very end of the
gas station, they had tire racks...

42:00.628 --> 42:02.504
...with chains around them.

42:02.714 --> 42:06.049
And I see there's
an Econoline van down there.

42:06.301 --> 42:08.844
And a guy with his T-shirt off.

42:09.095 --> 42:13.390
And he's packing this Econoline van...

42:13.600 --> 42:16.059
...with all these tires.

42:16.269 --> 42:19.938
He's got the last two tires
in his hands.

42:20.815 --> 42:26.903
Pushes them into the thing.
And I, of course, I go, "Hey, you!"

42:27.113 --> 42:32.326
This guy turns around.
He's got no shirt on. He's sweating.

42:32.535 --> 42:37.831
Built like a brick shithouse.
Pulls out a knife, 12 inches long...

42:38.041 --> 42:41.877
...and starts running at me
as fast as he can, going:

42:42.086 --> 42:45.130
Haaaa!

42:46.633 --> 42:47.966
I'm still:

42:50.136 --> 42:51.595
"This is wrong."

42:52.930 --> 42:54.473
I walked in...

42:55.600 --> 43:01.480
...stuck my hand behind the register
where the owner kept a.41 revolver.

43:01.689 --> 43:02.939
I pull it out...

43:03.316 --> 43:04.566
...cock the trigger...

43:04.776 --> 43:10.280
...and as I turn around, he's coming
through the door. I saw his eyes.

43:10.490 --> 43:13.325
I'll never forget this guy's eyes.

43:13.534 --> 43:18.830
He just had bad thoughts
about me in his eyes.

43:19.040 --> 43:22.959
I fired a round and it hit him,
boom, right in the chest.

43:23.169 --> 43:28.131
Bang! As fast as he came in the door,
he went out the door.

43:28.341 --> 43:32.886
He went right up between
the two pumps, ethyl and regular.

43:33.137 --> 43:39.476
He must have been on drugs, on speed
or something, because he stood up.

43:39.769 --> 43:44.815
He still had the knife, and blood
was just all over his chest.

43:45.024 --> 43:50.070
He stood up and went like that,
just moved a little. I'm in shock.

43:50.279 --> 43:55.909
So I held the trigger back and fanned the
hammer, it was one of those old-time:

43:58.037 --> 44:00.997
I blew him out of the gas station.

44:01.207 --> 44:04.626
Ever since then, I always carry this.

44:07.672 --> 44:11.758
A well-armed populace
is the best defense against tyranny.

44:12.009 --> 44:13.719
I'll drink to that.

44:19.392 --> 44:24.604
You know, I haven't fired this in
a long time, I don't know if it works.

44:24.814 --> 44:27.649
Pull the trigger and find out.

45:23.956 --> 45:28.335
Hey, man, I guess you already
took off or something.

45:29.128 --> 45:35.133
Remind me to tell you about this dream
I had. There was some funny stuff.

45:35.343 --> 45:39.429
All right, man.
I guess I'll catch you later. Okay.

45:46.854 --> 45:51.191
...in the bareback riding.
Copenhagen William from Mike sankey...

45:52.318 --> 45:55.362
Then, for a hatband,
sew it into the inside...

45:55.905 --> 45:57.864
I do not await the future...

45:58.074 --> 46:02.077
...anticipating salvation, absolution
or even enlightenment.

46:02.286 --> 46:07.666
I believe that this flawed perfection
is sufficient and complete...

46:07.875 --> 46:11.795
...in every single, ineffable moment.

46:12.004 --> 46:14.381
- The Blond Bee, Firefly, snake...

46:15.383 --> 46:18.593
- lunatic macaroni munchkin
with my goo-gat...

46:22.598 --> 46:26.768
- venerable tradition of sorcerers,
shamans and visionaries...

46:26.978 --> 46:30.647
...who have perfected
the art of dream travel...

46:30.857 --> 46:36.361
...the so-called lucid dream state,
where, by controlling your dreams...

46:36.571 --> 46:42.492
...you can discover things beyond your
apprehension in your awake state.

46:47.748 --> 46:49.165
- Winning back-to...

46:49.709 --> 46:51.918
she tells him what Felix is doing.

46:52.169 --> 46:55.338
A single ego
is an absurdly narrow vantage...

46:55.548 --> 46:57.799
...from which to view this experience.

46:58.092 --> 47:01.970
Where most consider their
relationship to the universe...

47:02.221 --> 47:06.850
...I contemplate relationships
of my various selves to one another.

47:07.310 --> 47:11.521
While most with mobility
problems can barely get around...

47:11.731 --> 47:15.108
...at age 92, Joy Cullison's
out seeing the world.

47:39.842 --> 47:41.885
Hey, how's it going?

47:43.596 --> 47:47.015
They say dreams are real
only as long as they last.

47:47.350 --> 47:49.225
Can't we say that about life?

47:49.602 --> 47:53.980
A lot of us are mapping the
mind-body relationship of dreams.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.109
We're called oneironauts,
explorers of the dream world.

47:58.444 --> 48:02.530
There are two opposing states
of consciousness...

48:02.740 --> 48:04.824
...that don't oppose at all.

48:05.034 --> 48:09.913
In the waking world, the neuro system
inhibits the vividness of memories.

48:10.164 --> 48:11.915
It makes evolutionary sense.

48:12.124 --> 48:14.751
It'd be maladapted if a predator...

48:14.961 --> 48:17.921
...could be mistaken
for the memory of one...

48:18.089 --> 48:21.049
...and vice versa.
If the memory of a predator...

48:21.217 --> 48:23.093
...conjured up a perceptual image...

48:23.302 --> 48:26.388
...we'd run whenever we
had a scary thought.

48:26.597 --> 48:29.808
Your serotonic neurons
inhibit hallucinations.

48:30.017 --> 48:33.520
They themselves are inhibited
during REM sleep.

48:33.729 --> 48:37.899
This allows dreams to appear real
but prevents competition...

48:38.109 --> 48:39.693
...from other perceptions.

48:39.902 --> 48:43.029
This is why dreams
are mistaken for reality.

48:43.239 --> 48:47.951
To the functional system of neural
activity that creates our world...

48:48.202 --> 48:53.665
...there is no difference between
dreaming a perception and an action...

48:53.874 --> 48:59.629
...and actually the waking
perception and action.

49:12.309 --> 49:16.312
A friend once told me the worst
mistake you can make...

49:16.480 --> 49:20.358
...is to think that you are alive...

49:22.278 --> 49:25.864
...when really you're asleep
in life's waiting room.

49:34.540 --> 49:40.879
The trick is to combine your waking
rational abilities...

49:41.172 --> 49:44.758
...with the infinite possibilities
of your dreams.

49:44.967 --> 49:48.344
Because if you can do that,
you can do anything.

49:49.597 --> 49:52.974
Ever have a job you hated
and worked real hard at?

49:53.225 --> 49:58.271
A long, hard day of work, finally you
go home, get in bed, close your eyes.

49:58.522 --> 50:04.861
Then you wake up and realize the whole
day at work had been a dream.

50:10.367 --> 50:14.704
It's bad enough you sell
your waking life for...

50:14.872 --> 50:19.542
...minimum wage, but now
they get your dreams for free.

50:21.754 --> 50:23.963
Hey, man, what are you doing here?

50:24.173 --> 50:27.759
I fancy myself a social lubricator
of the dream world...

50:27.968 --> 50:30.428
...helping people get lucid easier.

50:30.679 --> 50:34.516
Cut out the fear and anxiety
and just rock 'n' roll.

50:34.683 --> 50:37.977
Becoming lucid, you mean knowing
you're dreaming?

50:38.187 --> 50:43.900
Then you can control it. They're more
realistic than non-lucid dreams.

50:44.068 --> 50:46.152
I just woke from a dream.

50:46.362 --> 50:50.448
It wasn't typical, more like
I was in an alternate universe.

50:50.658 --> 50:55.120
Yep, it's real. Technically,
it's a phenomenon of sleep...

50:55.329 --> 50:57.872
...but you can have so much
fun in dreams.

50:58.082 --> 51:02.544
- And everyone knows, fun rules.
- Yeah.

51:02.753 --> 51:06.840
- What was going on in your dream?
- A lot of people talking.

51:07.007 --> 51:10.260
Some was absurdist,
like from a strange movie.

51:10.469 --> 51:14.305
Mostly people went off about
whatever, really intensely.

51:14.557 --> 51:15.974
I woke up wondering...

51:16.183 --> 51:19.686
...where did this stuff come from?
- You can control that.

51:19.937 --> 51:24.107
- You have these dreams a lot?
- I always make the best of it.

51:24.316 --> 51:28.236
You have to realize you're
dreaming in the first place.

51:28.487 --> 51:29.821
To recognize it.

51:30.030 --> 51:34.075
You have to be able to ask yourself,
"Is this a dream?"

51:34.285 --> 51:38.454
Most people never ask themselves that,
awake or asleep.

51:39.039 --> 51:43.501
People sleepwalk in the waking
state and wakewalk through dreams.

51:43.711 --> 51:45.461
They don't get much out of it.

51:45.671 --> 51:50.466
What snapped me into realizing
I was dreaming was my clock.

51:50.676 --> 51:55.305
I couldn't read it,
like the circuitry was screwed up.

51:55.514 --> 52:00.560
That's common. Small printed material
is pretty tough too. Very unstable.

52:00.811 --> 52:05.023
Another tip-off is trying
to adjust light levels. You can't.

52:05.232 --> 52:09.152
If you see a light switch nearby,
see if it works.

52:09.361 --> 52:11.905
You can't do that in a lucid dream.

52:12.114 --> 52:17.535
What the hell? I can fly around, have
a conversation with Albert Schweitzer.

52:17.745 --> 52:20.580
I can explore new
dimensions of reality.

52:20.789 --> 52:25.752
Not to mention, I can have any kind
of sex I want. Which is way cool.

52:25.961 --> 52:27.754
So I can't adjust lights!

52:27.963 --> 52:31.716
So that's what you do to test
if you're dreaming?

52:32.009 --> 52:34.928
You can train yourself to recognize it.

52:35.137 --> 52:36.971
Hit a switch now and then.

52:37.181 --> 52:41.684
If the lights are on and you can't
turn them off, you're dreaming.

52:41.894 --> 52:46.231
Then you can get down to business.
And it's unlimited.

52:46.440 --> 52:49.108
- Know what I've been working on?
- What?

52:49.318 --> 52:52.820
It's way ambitious.
But I'm getting better at it.

52:53.030 --> 52:54.197
You'll dig this.

52:54.406 --> 52:58.576
Three-sixty vision, man. I can see
in all directions. Cool, huh?

52:59.078 --> 53:03.373
Yeah! Man...
Well, I gotta go, man.

53:03.582 --> 53:06.876
Later. Super perfundo
on the early eve of your day.

53:07.086 --> 53:08.253
What's that mean?

53:08.462 --> 53:11.256
I've never figured it out.
Maybe you can.

53:11.465 --> 53:14.008
This guy always whispers it in my ear.

53:14.218 --> 53:17.178
Louis.
He's a recurring dream character.

54:45.142 --> 54:47.352
Cinema, in its essence...

54:47.603 --> 54:54.025
...is about reproduction of reality,
which is, reality is reproduced.

54:54.276 --> 54:56.819
For him,
it's not a storytelling medium.

54:57.029 --> 54:58.488
He feels like...

54:58.697 --> 55:03.242
...like film... Like literature
is better for telling a story.

55:03.452 --> 55:04.452
Mm-hm. Yeah.

55:04.661 --> 55:08.081
Like if you tell a joke.
"A guy walks into a bar...

55:08.374 --> 55:10.416
...and sees a dwarf."

55:10.667 --> 55:16.506
That works. You imagine a guy and a
dwarf in a bar, and it's imaginative.

55:16.715 --> 55:19.759
But in film,
you film a specific guy...

55:19.968 --> 55:24.847
...in a specific bar with a specific
dwarf who looks a certain way.

55:25.057 --> 55:30.728
Like, for Bazin, what
the ontology of film has to do with...

55:30.938 --> 55:32.897
...is what photography has...
- Right.

55:33.107 --> 55:37.235
...except it adds time
and greater realism.

55:37.486 --> 55:43.908
So it's about that guy,
at that moment, in that space.

55:44.118 --> 55:47.703
And Bazin is, like, a Christian,
so he believes...

55:47.955 --> 55:51.624
...in God, obviously,
and that everything...

55:51.834 --> 55:54.210
For him, reality and God are the same.

55:54.461 --> 55:59.424
So what film is actually capturing is,
like, God incarnate, creating...

55:59.675 --> 56:04.303
...and, like this very moment,
God is manifesting as this.

56:04.596 --> 56:07.140
What film would capture
here right now...

56:07.307 --> 56:12.145
...would be God as this table, as you,
as me. God looking how we look...

56:12.396 --> 56:16.566
...saying and thinking what we think,
because we're all God manifest.

56:16.692 --> 56:17.733
Mm-hm.

56:17.943 --> 56:22.488
So film is a record of God,
or the ever-changing face of God.

56:22.739 --> 56:24.824
You have a mosquito. Want me to?

56:24.992 --> 56:26.159
- You got it.
- I got it?

56:26.410 --> 56:27.994
- Yeah, you got it.
- Okay.

56:28.162 --> 56:33.583
Hollywood has taken film and made it
a storytelling medium. You take...

56:33.792 --> 56:39.005
...books or stories, get a script
and find someone who fits it.

56:39.214 --> 56:42.467
It's ridiculous.
It shouldn't be based on the script.

56:42.676 --> 56:46.429
It should be based on the person
or the thing.

56:46.889 --> 56:51.058
They're right to have the star system.
Then it's about that person...

56:51.226 --> 56:53.895
- Right, yeah.
...instead of the story.

56:54.104 --> 56:57.773
Truffaut said the best films
aren't made...

56:57.983 --> 57:01.527
The best scripts
don't make the best films.

57:01.820 --> 57:04.489
They have a narrative
you're a slave to.

57:04.656 --> 57:10.244
The best films are the ones
that aren't tied to that, slavishly.

57:10.454 --> 57:12.997
So the narrative thing seems to me...

57:13.207 --> 57:16.959
There's narrativity to film
because it's in time, like music.

57:17.169 --> 57:22.715
But you don't think of the story of
the song. It comes out of the moment.

57:22.925 --> 57:26.677
That's what film has.
It's that moment, which is holy.

57:26.887 --> 57:30.014
This moment is holy.
We walk around like it's not.

57:30.224 --> 57:33.476
Like there are some holy moments
and others are not.

57:33.685 --> 57:34.685
Right.

57:34.895 --> 57:40.358
Like, this moment is holy. Film lets us
see that, can frame it so we see it.

57:41.401 --> 57:46.072
"Holy, holy, holy" moment by moment.
But who can live that way?

57:46.281 --> 57:52.078
Because if I were to look at you and
let you be holy, I would stop talking.

57:52.287 --> 57:56.457
You'd be in the moment.
The moment is holy, right?

57:56.667 --> 57:59.669
Yeah, I'd be open.
I'd look in your eyes...

57:59.878 --> 58:04.340
...I'd cry and I'd feel this stuff,
and that's not polite.

58:04.550 --> 58:06.425
It'd make you uncomfortable.

58:06.677 --> 58:10.513
You could laugh too.
Why would you cry?

58:10.764 --> 58:14.183
Well, I don't know.
For me, I just tend to cry.

58:14.351 --> 58:17.853
Uh-huh. Well, is the?

58:18.105 --> 58:20.398
Let's do it right now.
Let's have a holy moment.

58:20.566 --> 58:22.608
Okay.

58:46.133 --> 58:47.550
- Everything is layers.
- Yeah.

58:47.759 --> 58:50.052
There's the holy moment, then...

58:50.262 --> 58:55.891
...the awareness of it. Like in film,
the actual moment happens...

58:56.310 --> 59:02.648
...then the character pretends to be
in a different reality. It's layers.

59:03.859 --> 59:07.528
I was in and out of the holy moment,
looking at you.

59:07.946 --> 59:10.823
You can't...
You're unique that way, Caveh.

59:11.033 --> 59:16.621
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you.
You can bring me into that.

59:36.016 --> 59:42.021
If the world is false and nothing
is true, then everything is possible.

59:42.272 --> 59:47.026
On the way to finding what we love, we
find what blocks us from our desire.

59:47.277 --> 59:49.737
Comfort will never be comfortable.

59:49.988 --> 59:52.782
A systematic questioning of happiness.

59:52.991 --> 59:58.871
Cut the vocal cords of every empowered
speaker and devalue currency.

59:59.081 --> 01:00:03.125
To confront the familiar.
Society is a fraud so complete...

01:00:03.335 --> 01:00:07.963
...and venal, it demands
to be destroyed beyond memory.

01:00:08.173 --> 01:00:10.341
If there's fire, we'll carry gas.

01:00:10.592 --> 01:00:15.054
Interrupt everyday experience
and the expectations that go with it.

01:00:15.263 --> 01:00:17.807
Live as if things depend
on your actions.

01:00:18.016 --> 01:00:21.519
Rupture the spell
of the consumer society...

01:00:21.812 --> 01:00:24.980
...so our repressed desires
can come forward.

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.567
Demonstrate what life is
and what it could be.

01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:32.113
To immerse ourselves
in the oblivion of actions.

01:00:32.322 --> 01:00:36.534
There'll be an intensity never known.
To exchange love and hate...

01:00:36.743 --> 01:00:39.036
...terror and redemption.

01:00:39.287 --> 01:00:45.543
Affirmation of freedom so reckless
it amounts to a denial of limitation.

01:00:56.763 --> 01:00:59.932
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm not sure.

01:01:00.559 --> 01:01:03.394
You need any help getting down, sir?

01:01:04.354 --> 01:01:07.022
No, I don't think so.

01:01:07.941 --> 01:01:09.984
Stupid bastard.

01:01:10.193 --> 01:01:13.279
No worse than us.
He's all action, no theory.

01:01:13.989 --> 01:01:16.657
We're all theory and no action.

01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:28.043
Why so glum, Mr. Deborg?

01:01:28.253 --> 01:01:32.798
What was missing
was felt irretrievable.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:39.263
The extreme uncertainties
of subsisting without working...

01:01:39.473 --> 01:01:42.475
...made excesses necessary...

01:01:42.684 --> 01:01:44.810
...and breaks definitive.

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:46.854
To quote Stevenson:

01:01:47.063 --> 01:01:50.816
"Suicide carried off many.

01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:54.487
Drink and the devil...

01:01:54.696 --> 01:01:57.239
...took care of the rest."

01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:09.126
- Hey!
- Hey.

01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.171
Are you a dreamer?

01:02:13.548 --> 01:02:15.090
Yeah.

01:02:17.427 --> 01:02:20.763
I haven't seen too many around lately.

01:02:21.097 --> 01:02:23.724
Things have been tough for dreamers.

01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:27.895
They say dreaming's dead.
No one does it anymore.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.232
It's not dead.
It's just been forgotten.

01:02:31.691 --> 01:02:33.484
Removed from our language.

01:02:33.693 --> 01:02:37.196
Nobody teaches it,
so no one knows it exists.

01:02:39.533 --> 01:02:42.493
The dreamer's banished to obscurity.

01:02:43.203 --> 01:02:46.539
I'm trying to change that.
I hope you are too...

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:50.209
...by dreaming every day.

01:02:51.586 --> 01:02:54.129
Dreaming with our hands and minds.

01:02:54.798 --> 01:02:59.426
Our planet is facing the greatest
problems it's ever faced. Ever.

01:02:59.636 --> 01:03:01.470
So don't be bored.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:06.058
This is the most exciting time
we could have hoped to be alive.

01:03:06.309 --> 01:03:08.686
And things are just starting.

01:03:24.911 --> 01:03:28.664
A thousand years is
an instant. There's nothing new.

01:03:28.915 --> 01:03:34.628
The same pattern over and over.
The same insights felt long ago.

01:03:34.838 --> 01:03:37.631
There's nothing here for me now.

01:03:37.841 --> 01:03:43.137
Now I remember. This happened
to me before. This is why I left.

01:03:44.890 --> 01:03:46.932
You have begun to find answers.

01:03:47.142 --> 01:03:49.894
Though difficult,
the rewards will be great.

01:03:50.145 --> 01:03:54.857
Exercise your mind fully,
knowing it is only an exercise.

01:03:55.108 --> 01:03:59.904
Build artifacts, solve problems,
explore the secrets of the universe.

01:04:00.113 --> 01:04:02.489
Savor input from all the senses.

01:04:02.741 --> 01:04:08.662
Feel joy, sorrow, laughter, empathy.
Tuck the memory in your travel bag.

01:04:08.997 --> 01:04:12.333
I remember where I'm from
and how I became human.

01:04:12.542 --> 01:04:15.794
Why I hung around.
Now my departure is scheduled.

01:04:16.338 --> 01:04:21.550
This way out. Escaping velocity.
Not just eternity, but infinity.

01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.246
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

01:04:55.293 --> 01:04:57.002
Hey.

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.506
Could we do that again?
I know we haven't met...

01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:03.258
...but I don't want to be an ant.

01:05:04.302 --> 01:05:07.846
We go through life
bouncing off one another...

01:05:08.056 --> 01:05:10.808
...continuously on ant autopilot...

01:05:11.017 --> 01:05:14.937
...with nothing really human
required of us.

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:18.315
Stop. Go. Walk here. Drive there.

01:05:18.525 --> 01:05:20.985
All action basically for survival.

01:05:21.194 --> 01:05:25.114
All communication to keep
the ant colony buzzing along...

01:05:25.365 --> 01:05:27.825
...in an efficient, polite manner.

01:05:28.076 --> 01:05:32.788
"Here's your change."
"Paper or plastic?" "Credit or debit?"

01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:34.957
"Want ketchup with that?"

01:05:35.166 --> 01:05:39.294
I don't want a straw,
I want real human moments.

01:05:39.546 --> 01:05:42.798
I want to see you.
I want you to see me.

01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:47.386
I don't want to give that up.
I don't want to be an ant, you know?

01:05:48.430 --> 01:05:50.723
Yeah, no...

01:05:51.016 --> 01:05:53.726
...I don't want to be an ant, either.

01:05:54.102 --> 01:05:57.604
Thanks for kind ofjostling me there.
I've been...

01:05:57.856 --> 01:06:03.694
...on zombie autopilot. I don't feel
like an ant, but I look like one.

01:06:04.696 --> 01:06:08.449
D.H. Lawrence had this idea
of two people meeting...

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:10.993
...and instead ofjust passing...

01:06:11.202 --> 01:06:15.205
...they accept "the confrontation
between their souls."

01:06:15.874 --> 01:06:20.002
It's like freeing the brave,
reckless gods within us all.

01:06:20.211 --> 01:06:22.755
Then it's like we have met.

01:06:23.548 --> 01:06:28.093
I'm doing a
soap opera, you might be interested.

01:06:28.386 --> 01:06:34.641
The characters are the fantasy
lives of the performers in it.

01:06:34.851 --> 01:06:40.314
So figure out something you've always
wanted to do, or a life you want...

01:06:40.523 --> 01:06:43.442
...something like that.
We write that in...

01:06:43.651 --> 01:06:50.157
...then you intersect with others
in some typical soap-opera fashion.

01:06:50.366 --> 01:06:55.162
Then I also want to show it live,
with the actors present.

01:06:55.413 --> 01:06:58.248
So once the episode's screened...

01:06:58.458 --> 01:07:04.546
...the audience can direct the actors
for subsequent episodes with menus.

01:07:04.839 --> 01:07:06.507
It has to do with choices...

01:07:06.716 --> 01:07:11.512
...and honoring people's ability
to say what it is they want to see...

01:07:11.763 --> 01:07:15.432
...and consumerism and art
and commodity...

01:07:15.642 --> 01:07:20.979
...and if you don't like it, send it
back, and you get what you pay for...

01:07:21.189 --> 01:07:24.942
...or just participating, you know,
making choices.

01:07:25.151 --> 01:07:27.277
So do you want to do it?

01:07:27.487 --> 01:07:32.616
Yeah, that sounds really cool.
I'd love to be in it, but...

01:07:33.827 --> 01:07:39.123
...I gotta ask you a question first.
I don't know how to say it, but...

01:07:40.083 --> 01:07:43.919
What's it like to be a character
in a dream? Because...

01:07:44.129 --> 01:07:48.757
...I'm not awake right now. I haven't
worn a watch since 4th grade.

01:07:48.967 --> 01:07:52.177
I think this is the same watch too.

01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.099
I don't know if you're able
to answer that question.

01:07:57.350 --> 01:08:02.563
I'm just trying to get a sense
of where I am and what's going on.

01:08:02.772 --> 01:08:05.440
What about you? What's your name?

01:08:05.650 --> 01:08:09.403
What's your address?
What are you doing?

01:08:11.406 --> 01:08:16.118
I can't really remember right now.
I can't really recall.

01:08:16.327 --> 01:08:21.832
But that's beside the point, whether
I can dredge up information about...

01:08:22.082 --> 01:08:27.421
...my address, or my mom's
maiden name or whatnot.

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:32.050
I've got the benefit in this reality,
if you call it that...

01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:34.553
...of a consistent perspective.

01:08:34.804 --> 01:08:37.346
What is your consistent perspective?

01:08:37.599 --> 01:08:41.268
It's mostly just me
dealing with a lot of people...

01:08:41.519 --> 01:08:47.774
...who are exposing me
to information and ideas...

01:08:48.026 --> 01:08:50.694
...that seem vaguely familiar.

01:08:50.904 --> 01:08:55.115
But at the same time,
it's all very alien to me.

01:08:55.325 --> 01:08:59.912
I'm not in an objective,
rational world.

01:09:00.121 --> 01:09:03.624
Like, I've been flying around...

01:09:05.167 --> 01:09:08.127
It's weird,
because it's not a fixed state.

01:09:08.296 --> 01:09:11.756
It's more like a whole spectrum
of awareness.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:15.385
The lucidity wavers.
Right now I know I'm dreaming.

01:09:15.595 --> 01:09:18.388
We're even talking about it. This is...

01:09:18.598 --> 01:09:22.850
...the most in myself
and in my thoughts I've been so far.

01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:26.563
I'm talking about being in a dream.

01:09:26.773 --> 01:09:29.858
But I'm beginning to think...

01:09:30.068 --> 01:09:33.569
...it's something I don't have
any precedent for.

01:09:33.779 --> 01:09:36.448
It's totally unique.

01:09:36.658 --> 01:09:40.243
The quality of the environment...

01:09:40.453 --> 01:09:45.499
...and the information I'm receiving.
Like your soap opera, for example.

01:09:45.750 --> 01:09:48.417
That's a really cool idea!

01:09:48.627 --> 01:09:51.880
I didn't come up with that.
It's outside myself...

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:55.884
...like something transmitted
to me externally.

01:09:56.135 --> 01:09:58.178
I don't know what this is.

01:09:58.346 --> 01:10:03.016
We think we're so limited
by the world and the confines...

01:10:03.226 --> 01:10:05.644
...but we're really
just creating them.

01:10:05.937 --> 01:10:11.775
You keep trying to figure it out,
but now you know you're dreaming...

01:10:11.985 --> 01:10:16.530
...you can do anything.
You're dreaming, but you're awake.

01:10:16.739 --> 01:10:18.657
You have...

01:10:19.033 --> 01:10:23.078
...so many options,
and that's what life is about.

01:10:23.288 --> 01:10:27.833
I understand what you're saying.
It's up to me, I'm the dreamer.

01:10:28.084 --> 01:10:29.334
It's weird.

01:10:29.544 --> 01:10:31.586
So much of the information...

01:10:31.796 --> 01:10:34.464
...these people have been imparting...

01:10:34.674 --> 01:10:38.427
...has got this
really heavy connotation to it.

01:10:39.012 --> 01:10:41.305
Well, how do you feel?

01:10:42.015 --> 01:10:44.850
Sometimes I feel kind of isolated.

01:10:45.059 --> 01:10:50.022
Most of the time, I feel connected,
engaged in this active process.

01:10:50.231 --> 01:10:55.944
Which is weird. Most of the time
I've been passive, not responding...

01:10:56.195 --> 01:10:57.612
...except for now.

01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.490
I've let information wash over me.

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:04.911
It's not necessarily passive
to not respond verbally.

01:11:05.079 --> 01:11:10.292
We're communicating
on so many levels simultaneously.

01:11:10.543 --> 01:11:13.795
Perhaps you're perceiving directly.

01:11:14.422 --> 01:11:19.843
Most of the people I've encountered
and the things I want to say...

01:11:20.053 --> 01:11:23.847
...it's like they say it for me,
almost at my cue.

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:28.185
It's complete unto itself.

01:11:28.936 --> 01:11:32.022
It's not a bad dream.
It's a great dream.

01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:33.815
But...

01:11:34.025 --> 01:11:38.653
...it's so unlike any other dream
I've ever had before.

01:11:38.905 --> 01:11:41.948
It's like "the" dream.

01:11:42.992 --> 01:11:45.452
It's like I'm being prepared
for something.

01:12:14.899 --> 01:12:18.485
"On this bridge," Lorca warns...

01:12:18.736 --> 01:12:20.779
..."life is not a dream.

01:12:20.988 --> 01:12:22.823
Beware and...

01:12:23.032 --> 01:12:27.035
...beware and beware."

01:12:27.245 --> 01:12:32.541
So many think because "then"
happened, "now" isn't.

01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:38.171
But didn't I mention? The ongoing
"wow" is happening right now.

01:12:38.381 --> 01:12:41.633
We are all coauthors
of this dancing exuberance...

01:12:41.884 --> 01:12:44.928
...where even our inabilities
are having a roast.

01:12:45.138 --> 01:12:49.724
We are the authors of ourselves,
coauthoring a Dostoyevsky novel...

01:12:49.934 --> 01:12:51.726
...starring clowns.

01:12:51.936 --> 01:12:54.479
This thing we're involved with,
the world...

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:59.359
...is an opportunity to exhibit
how exciting alienation can be.

01:12:59.569 --> 01:13:02.320
Life is a matter of a miracle...

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:07.576
...collected by moments flabbergasted
to be in each other's presence.

01:13:07.827 --> 01:13:09.369
The world is an exam...

01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:13.290
...to see if we can rise
into the direct experiences.

01:13:13.499 --> 01:13:17.085
Eyesight is a test
to see if we can see beyond it.

01:13:17.295 --> 01:13:20.213
Matter is a test for our curiosity.

01:13:20.423 --> 01:13:23.508
Doubt is an exam for our vitality.

01:13:23.885 --> 01:13:29.556
Thomas Mann wrote that he would rather
participate in life than write.

01:13:29.807 --> 01:13:33.935
Giacometti was once run down by a car.

01:13:34.145 --> 01:13:37.314
He recalled falling
into a lucid faint...

01:13:37.607 --> 01:13:39.357
...a sudden exhilaration...

01:13:39.609 --> 01:13:43.195
...as he realized
something was happening to him.

01:13:43.529 --> 01:13:48.283
One assumes you can't understand
life and live simultaneously.

01:13:48.493 --> 01:13:53.038
I don't agree entirely. Which is
to say, I don't exactly disagree.

01:13:53.414 --> 01:13:58.126
I would say that life understood
is life lived.

01:13:58.419 --> 01:14:00.712
But the paradoxes bug me.

01:14:00.922 --> 01:14:05.550
I can learn to love, and make love,
to the paradoxes that bug me.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:08.220
And on romantic evenings of self...

01:14:08.471 --> 01:14:11.515
...I go salsa dancing
with my confusion.

01:14:11.724 --> 01:14:14.935
Before you drift off, don't forget...

01:14:15.186 --> 01:14:16.937
...which is to say, remember.

01:14:17.188 --> 01:14:22.234
Because remembering is so much more
a psychotic activity than forgetting.

01:14:22.485 --> 01:14:24.945
Lorca, in that same poem, said...

01:14:25.154 --> 01:14:29.449
...that the iguana will bite
those who do not dream.

01:14:30.493 --> 01:14:33.620
And, as one realizes...

01:14:33.871 --> 01:14:39.251
...that one is a dream figure
in another person's dream...

01:14:39.877 --> 01:14:43.421
...that is self-awareness.

01:15:07.989 --> 01:15:10.991
You haven't met yourself yet.

01:15:12.618 --> 01:15:16.830
But the advantage to meeting others
in the meantime...

01:15:17.039 --> 01:15:21.668
...is that one of them
may present you to yourself.

01:15:23.629 --> 01:15:28.425
Examine the nature of everything
you observe.

01:15:28.676 --> 01:15:31.928
For instance,
you might find yourself...

01:15:32.179 --> 01:15:36.516
...walking through
a dream parking lot.

01:15:36.726 --> 01:15:40.770
And, yes, those are dream feet
inside your dream shoes.

01:15:41.063 --> 01:15:42.981
Part of your dream self.

01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:46.860
And so, the person you appear to be
in the dream...

01:15:47.069 --> 01:15:49.863
...cannot be who you really are.

01:15:50.072 --> 01:15:52.073
This is an image...

01:15:52.283 --> 01:15:54.909
...a mental model.

01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:20.685
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't think so.

01:16:21.187 --> 01:16:26.149
At the station? You were on the
pay phone and you looked at me...

01:16:26.359 --> 01:16:28.318
...a few times.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.656
I remember that,
but I don't remember that being you.

01:16:33.532 --> 01:16:35.492
Are you sure?

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:40.080
Maybe not.

01:16:40.373 --> 01:16:42.582
I was sitting down...

01:16:42.792 --> 01:16:45.794
...and you were looking at me.

01:17:40.057 --> 01:17:44.227
My little friend,
dream no more. It's really here.

01:17:44.437 --> 01:17:46.730
It's called Efferdent Plus.

01:17:46.939 --> 01:17:52.152
In hell, you sink. In heaven, you rise
to your fullness of love.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.948
Hurry up! Come on,
get in the car. Let's go.

01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:01.661
The story goes like this:
Billy Wilder runs into Louis Malle.

01:18:01.871 --> 01:18:04.164
This was the late '50s, early '60s.

01:18:04.415 --> 01:18:09.043
Malle had just made his most expensive
film, which cost $ 21/2 million.

01:18:09.295 --> 01:18:12.005
Wilder asks him what the film's about.

01:18:12.214 --> 01:18:15.049
Malle says, "It's a dream
within a dream."

01:18:15.259 --> 01:18:18.428
Wilder says,
"You just lost $ 21/2 million."

01:18:19.597 --> 01:18:22.140
I feel a little apprehensive.

01:18:29.482 --> 01:18:32.400
For years, the notion
that life is a dream...

01:18:32.651 --> 01:18:36.780
...has been a pervasive theme
of philosophers and poets.

01:18:36.989 --> 01:18:41.117
Doesn't it make sense that death
would be wrapped in a dream?

01:18:41.327 --> 01:18:47.332
That, after death, your conscious life
would continue in a dream body?

01:18:47.541 --> 01:18:51.920
It would be the same dream body
as in your everyday dream life...

01:18:52.171 --> 01:18:57.383
...except that in the post-mortal
state, you could never again wake up.

01:18:57.593 --> 01:19:00.637
Never again return
to your physical body.

01:19:11.190 --> 01:19:16.986
As the pattern gets more intricate,
being swept along isn't enough.

01:19:39.718 --> 01:19:41.427
What's the word, turd?

01:19:42.888 --> 01:19:47.058
- Hey, do you also drive a boat-car?
- A what?

01:19:47.476 --> 01:19:51.062
You gave me a ride in a car
that was also a boat.

01:19:51.272 --> 01:19:55.817
No, I don't have a "boat-car."
I don't know what you mean.

01:19:56.026 --> 01:20:01.656
This must be parallel universe night.
That cat who just ran out the door?

01:20:01.907 --> 01:20:04.450
He comes up and I say,
"What's the word?"

01:20:04.702 --> 01:20:08.454
He lays down a burrito,
looks at me and says:

01:20:08.664 --> 01:20:11.457
"I've returned
from the valley of death.

01:20:11.667 --> 01:20:14.711
I rapturously breathe in
the odors of life.

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:21.009
I've been to oblivion. I ferment
the desire to remember everything."

01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:25.263
So, what did you say to that?

01:20:25.764 --> 01:20:27.974
Well, I mean, what could I say?

01:20:28.225 --> 01:20:31.895
I said, "If you microwave that,
poke holes in the plastic...

01:20:32.187 --> 01:20:37.317
...because they explode,
and I'm tired of cleaning up burrito."

01:20:42.364 --> 01:20:44.282
The jalapeÃ±os dry up.

01:20:45.159 --> 01:20:47.452
They're like little wheels.

01:20:51.081 --> 01:20:54.417
When it was over,
all I could think about was how...

01:20:54.627 --> 01:20:58.212
...this entire notion of oneself...

01:20:58.380 --> 01:20:59.422
...what we are...

01:20:59.673 --> 01:21:03.426
...is just this logical structure.

01:21:03.677 --> 01:21:08.723
A place to momentarily house
all the abstractions.

01:21:09.183 --> 01:21:11.809
It was a time to become conscious...

01:21:12.019 --> 01:21:16.272
...to give form and coherence
to the mystery.

01:21:16.482 --> 01:21:19.901
And I had been a part of that.
It was a gift.

01:21:21.153 --> 01:21:26.491
Life was raging all around me,
and every moment was magical.

01:21:27.076 --> 01:21:33.331
I loved all the people, dealing with
all the contradictory impulses.

01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:38.336
That's what I loved the most,
connecting with the people.

01:21:38.879 --> 01:21:42.298
Looking back, that's all
that really mattered.

01:22:39.648 --> 01:22:44.277
Kierkegaard's last words were,
"Sweep me up."

01:25:40.537 --> 01:25:42.288
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

01:25:49.254 --> 01:25:54.508
Weren't you in the boat-car?
The guy with the hat gave me a ride...

01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:58.512
...in his car-boat thing.
You were in the back seat.

01:25:58.764 --> 01:26:02.433
I'm not saying you don't know
what you're talking about...

01:26:02.643 --> 01:26:05.102
...but I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:26:05.395 --> 01:26:10.691
You guys let me off at this specific
spot you gave him directions to.

01:26:10.901 --> 01:26:13.444
I get out,
ended up getting hit by a car.

01:26:13.654 --> 01:26:15.863
Then I woke up. I was dreaming.

01:26:16.073 --> 01:26:21.619
Later I found out I was still
dreaming, dreaming that I'd woken up.

01:26:21.870 --> 01:26:25.039
False awakenings,
I used to have those a lot.

01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:28.793
But I'm still in it now.
I can't get out of it.

01:26:29.002 --> 01:26:34.131
It's been going on forever.
I keep waking up into another dream.

01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:38.302
I'm getting creeped out, like
I'm talking to dead people.

01:26:38.553 --> 01:26:41.806
This woman on TV tells me how death...

01:26:42.057 --> 01:26:45.977
...is this dream-time
that exists out of life.

01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:49.897
I'm starting to think I'm dead.

01:26:52.317 --> 01:26:54.610
Let me tell you about a dream I had.

01:26:54.820 --> 01:27:00.116
When someone says that, usually
you're in for a very boring few minutes.

01:27:00.409 --> 01:27:02.868
But what else are you gonna do?

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:08.249
- I read this essay by Philip K. Dick.
- In your dream?

01:27:08.458 --> 01:27:12.295
No, I read it before the dream.
It was the preamble.

01:27:12.546 --> 01:27:16.215
It was about that book,
Flow My Tears, the Policeman said.

01:27:16.466 --> 01:27:21.679
- He won an award for that one.
- That's the one he wrote really fast.

01:27:21.888 --> 01:27:26.267
It just flowed out of him.
He felt he was channeling it.

01:27:26.476 --> 01:27:29.895
So four years later,
he was at this party.

01:27:30.105 --> 01:27:33.774
He met a woman with the same name
as the woman in the book.

01:27:34.067 --> 01:27:37.903
Her boyfriend had the same name
as the boyfriend in the book.

01:27:38.113 --> 01:27:41.365
She had an affair
with the chief of police.

01:27:41.575 --> 01:27:45.036
He had the same name
as the chief in his book.

01:27:45.287 --> 01:27:49.040
Everything she's saying
is right out of his book.

01:27:49.207 --> 01:27:52.835
That really freaks him out,
but what can he do?

01:27:53.045 --> 01:27:56.213
Shortly after that,
he was mailing a letter...

01:27:56.423 --> 01:28:01.719
...and he saw this kind of
shady-Iooking guy standing by his car.

01:28:01.928 --> 01:28:06.807
But instead of avoiding him,
he said, "Can I help you?"

01:28:07.059 --> 01:28:09.435
The guy said, "I ran out of gas."

01:28:09.686 --> 01:28:13.773
He hands him some money,
which he never would've done.

01:28:13.982 --> 01:28:15.733
He gets home and thinks:

01:28:15.942 --> 01:28:19.987
"This guy can't get to a gas station.
He's out of gas."

01:28:20.197 --> 01:28:25.534
So he goes back, finds the guy
and takes him to a gas station.

01:28:25.827 --> 01:28:29.747
As he pulls up he thinks,
"This is in my book too.

01:28:30.082 --> 01:28:33.667
This exact station. This exact guy.
Everything."

01:28:33.877 --> 01:28:37.171
So this whole episode
is kind of creepy, right?

01:28:37.422 --> 01:28:41.467
He's telling his priest
how he wrote this book...

01:28:41.676 --> 01:28:45.096
...and four years later
all these things happened.

01:28:45.305 --> 01:28:49.058
And the priest says,
"That's the Book of Acts."

01:28:49.267 --> 01:28:51.769
He's like, "I've never read it."

01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:55.773
So he reads the Book of Acts,
and it's uncanny.

01:28:56.024 --> 01:28:59.860
Even the characters' names
are the same as in the Bible.

01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:03.739
The Book of Acts
takes place in 50 A.D.

01:29:03.949 --> 01:29:07.952
So Dick had this theory
that time was an illusion...

01:29:08.161 --> 01:29:10.287
...and that we were all in 50 A.D.

01:29:10.497 --> 01:29:14.250
The reason he wrote this book
was that he somehow...

01:29:14.459 --> 01:29:17.628
...punctured through
this veil of time.

01:29:17.921 --> 01:29:22.007
He'd seen what was going on
in the Book of Acts.

01:29:22.259 --> 01:29:26.679
He was really into Gnosticism
and the idea that this demon...

01:29:26.888 --> 01:29:30.558
...created this illusion of time
to make us forget...

01:29:30.851 --> 01:29:36.147
...that Christ was to return
and the kingdom of God would arrive.

01:29:36.356 --> 01:29:40.985
Someone's trying to make us forget
that God is imminent.

01:29:41.236 --> 01:29:43.612
That's what time and history is.

01:29:43.822 --> 01:29:47.908
This kind of continuous
daydream or distraction.

01:29:48.076 --> 01:29:52.830
I read it and thought, "That's weird."
And that night I had a dream.

01:29:53.081 --> 01:29:56.417
There was this guy who
was supposed to be psychic.

01:29:56.626 --> 01:29:59.628
But I was, like,
"He's not really a psychic."

01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:04.758
Then suddenly I start floating,
levitating up to the ceiling.

01:30:05.177 --> 01:30:10.306
As I almost go through the roof,
I'm like, "Okay, I believe you."

01:30:10.515 --> 01:30:14.268
And I float down,
and as my feet touch the ground...

01:30:14.519 --> 01:30:19.106
...the psychic turns into a woman
in a green dress, Lady Gregory.

01:30:19.316 --> 01:30:22.735
Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron,
this Irish person.

01:30:22.986 --> 01:30:25.362
Though I'd never seen her image...

01:30:25.572 --> 01:30:29.867
...I was sure that this was
the face of Lady Gregory.

01:30:30.118 --> 01:30:32.495
So Lady Gregory turns to me and says:

01:30:32.746 --> 01:30:35.956
"Let me explain
the nature of the universe.

01:30:36.166 --> 01:30:40.211
Philip K. Dick is right about time,
but wrong that it's 50 A.D.

01:30:40.462 --> 01:30:45.424
Actually, there's only one instant,
right now. And it's eternity.

01:30:45.634 --> 01:30:50.763
It's an instant in which God
is posing a question, which is:

01:30:51.014 --> 01:30:56.143
'Do you wanna be one with eternity,
do you wanna be in heaven? '

01:30:56.394 --> 01:31:00.314
And we're all saying,
'No, thank you. Not just yet."'

01:31:00.565 --> 01:31:05.110
So time is just this constant
saying no to God's invitation.

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:09.657
That's what time is.
It's no more 50 A.D. Than it's 2001.

01:31:09.866 --> 01:31:13.953
There's just one instant,
and that's what we're always in.

01:31:14.287 --> 01:31:19.083
Then she tells me that this is
the narrative of everyone's life.

01:31:19.292 --> 01:31:23.337
Behind the huge difference,
there is but one story...

01:31:23.547 --> 01:31:26.006
...of moving from the no
to the yes.

01:31:26.258 --> 01:31:29.301
All of life is,
"No, thank you. No, thank you."

01:31:29.511 --> 01:31:32.179
Then ultimately it's, "Yes, I give in.

01:31:32.430 --> 01:31:36.767
Yes, I accept. Yes, I embrace."
That's the journey.

01:31:37.018 --> 01:31:40.854
Everyone gets to the yes
in the end, right?

01:31:41.064 --> 01:31:42.064
Right.

01:31:42.274 --> 01:31:46.026
So we continue walking,
and my dog runs over to me.

01:31:46.278 --> 01:31:49.029
I'm so happy.
He's been dead for years.

01:31:49.239 --> 01:31:52.992
So I'm petting him,
and there's this gross stuff...

01:31:53.201 --> 01:31:55.494
...coming out of his stomach.

01:31:55.745 --> 01:31:58.831
I look over at Lady Gregory,
and she coughs.

01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:01.125
She's like, "Excuse me."

01:32:01.334 --> 01:32:05.713
And vomit dribbles down her chin.
It smells really bad.

01:32:06.006 --> 01:32:10.801
And I think,
"That's not just the smell of vomit.

01:32:11.052 --> 01:32:16.098
That's the smell of dead-person vomit."
So it's, like, doubly foul.

01:32:16.349 --> 01:32:21.729
I realize I'm in the land of the dead.
Everyone around me was dead.

01:32:21.938 --> 01:32:25.858
My dog had been dead 10 years,
Lady Gregory a lot longer.

01:32:26.067 --> 01:32:29.903
When I woke up, I was like,
"That wasn't a dream.

01:32:30.113 --> 01:32:34.325
That was a visitation
to this place, the land of the dead."

01:32:34.534 --> 01:32:36.994
So how did you finally get out of it?

01:32:37.287 --> 01:32:41.415
It was, like, one of those
life-altering experiences.

01:32:41.625 --> 01:32:44.752
I never looked at the world
the same way again.

01:32:44.961 --> 01:32:48.172
But how did you finally
get out of the dream?

01:32:48.381 --> 01:32:51.050
That's my problem. I'm trapped.

01:32:51.259 --> 01:32:56.138
I keep thinking I'm waking up,
but I'm still in a dream.

01:32:56.348 --> 01:33:00.559
I wanna wake up for real.
How do you really wake up?

01:33:00.769 --> 01:33:04.438
I don't know.
I'm not very good at that anymore.

01:33:04.689 --> 01:33:09.735
But if that's what you're thinking,
you should, if you can.

01:33:09.944 --> 01:33:12.863
Because someday, you won't be able to.

01:33:13.073 --> 01:33:16.116
But it's easy. You know, just wake up.
