00:59.827 --> 01:01.895
Push, baby. You're
doing so well.

01:01.929 --> 01:05.799

Yeah well, we all know
he doesn't need a costume

07:03.991 --> 07:05.526
To be a clown.

07:05.559 --> 07:07.595
Whatever.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.497

You look funny
as a clown.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.188
But I'm the best clown in the
world, aren't I?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.624
Yep!

07:36.657 --> 07:38.391

07:39.259 --> 07:40.393
Georgia!

07:40.427 --> 07:41.328
Yeah?

07:41.361 --> 07:43.363
Come here, mummy's on
the phone for you.

07:43.396 --> 07:46.433
Uncle Tommy, stop.
Mummy's on the phone.

07:46.466 --> 07:47.868
Okay, off you hop.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.110
Hey sweetie,
how's it going?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.311
Wicked witch, aye?

07:58.345 --> 07:59.713
She could have
called first thing.

07:59.747 --> 08:00.981
Geez, it gives
me the shits.

08:01.014 --> 08:01.915
I wouldn't worry
about it mate.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.452
Look around, Georgia's
having a blast.

08:05.485 --> 08:07.788
From Uncle Colin I got a
princess doll.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.290
A princess doll, wow!

08:10.323 --> 08:12.392
Okay baby, can you put your
daddy back on the phone for me?

08:12.425 --> 08:15.996
Yep. Daddy, mummy wants you.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.865
Good luck mate.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.334
You know what, I'm glad your
family's having fun

08:21.368 --> 08:23.003
With my daughter!

08:24.471 --> 08:25.472
Oh please!

08:25.505 --> 08:28.576
Yeah, I'll have her back
no later then six pm!

08:28.609 --> 08:30.944
Okay, can I go now and
enjoy my daughter's birthday?

08:30.978 --> 08:31.912
Piss off, Derek!

08:31.945 --> 08:34.246
Thank you! Thank
you very much!

08:44.424 --> 08:46.026
Great day yesterday,
Georgia had a ball, aye?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.661
Yeah, she did.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.563
Hey, thanks again for
everything.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.599
She loved that doll,
even took it home with her.

08:51.632 --> 08:54.267
Any time, she's like
my daughter as well.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.036
She's so similar
to you, you know.

08:56.069 --> 08:59.707
I think that's what pisses
her mother off the most.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.041
You heard from
Tommy yet?

09:01.074 --> 09:04.111
Nope. He was suppose to be here
to get the rosolins' order out,

09:04.144 --> 09:06.580
But as usual, one of us
will have to finish it.

09:06.614 --> 09:08.716
Yeah, I'll get onto it.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.021
Speak of the devil.
He's all yours, mate.

09:18.659 --> 09:19.993
Hey boys!

09:20.027 --> 09:22.930
Tommy, we've spoken about this.
You promised you weren't going

09:22.963 --> 09:24.064
To be late anymore.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.933
Sorry bro, it was a
late night.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.434
Yeah, well make sure it
doesn't happen again.

09:27.467 --> 09:28.669
You're starting to
piss Colin off,

09:28.702 --> 09:30.270
And he owns this
place as well.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.639
Things are hard enough as it
is and this behavior's

09:31.672 --> 09:32.272
Not good enough.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.641
Okay! I get it boss!

09:33.674 --> 09:36.610
Jeeze, I'll make
it up to you.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.781
Well, actually next
weekend I have a date.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.082
Did I hear right?

09:42.115 --> 09:44.517
You have a date?

09:44.551 --> 09:45.919
So uh, how much
you paying her?

09:45.953 --> 09:47.320
Yeah, yeah.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.156
But seriously, I
have Georgia.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.123
Can you watch her
that night, please?

09:50.157 --> 09:52.159
Look, I can help out if
Tommy can't step up.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.161
Come on it's one night,
you've done it before.

09:54.194 --> 09:56.163
Go on mate, she's the cutest
niece you've got.

09:56.196 --> 09:58.766
Okay! I'll do it.

09:58.799 --> 10:01.001
And not so you
can score either!

10:01.034 --> 10:02.269
I'll pick her
up first thing.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.603
Yeah, no
worries mate.

10:03.637 --> 10:06.239
Now, go get that
job finished for me.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.141
Yeah, you little prick.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.392
**

10:51.251 --> 10:53.721
Can you come in
here for a minute?

11:00.794 --> 11:03.496
Oy, do
some work.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.167
Close the door.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.539
Think I know
what's coming.

11:12.572 --> 11:13.874
This the tax
paper work?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.376
Yep, and these are the
bills that we are behind in.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.078
Look, we've spoken
about this mate,

11:18.111 --> 11:20.814
And today we have to
make a decision.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.415
I know.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.051
Well, we've kept your
brother on, and he is always

11:24.084 --> 11:26.686
Late, and we cant
afford to pay him anymore.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.421
The time has come to
let him go, my friend.

11:28.455 --> 11:29.823
It's either that, or we'll
all be out of jobs,

11:29.857 --> 11:32.659
And you've got a
daughter to think about.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.562
Well, I think you
better tell him.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.330
He might take
a swing at me.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.934
Okay, I'll take care of it. Just
give me a few more

11:40.968 --> 11:43.837
Days, so we can get
these last jobs out.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.039
Then I'll
talk to him.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.176
Then you'll do it?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.479
Yeah, I'll do it.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.015
I promise.

12:01.822 --> 12:05.225
Dad, will sian be
at Uncle Tommy's house?

12:05.258 --> 12:06.626
You know what, I'm
not too sure.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.395
I guess we'll see
when we get there.

12:08.428 --> 12:11.164
Sian said she'll paint
my nails for me.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.566
I bet she can't do them as
good as daddy can, hey?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.168
Nope!

12:18.071 --> 12:19.439
Hey, look sian
is here!

12:19.472 --> 12:20.440
Is she?

12:20.473 --> 12:23.443
Yep, that's
her car.

12:40.060 --> 12:41.128
Hey mate.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.095
Hey man.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.964
Now, she has to
have a bath,

12:43.997 --> 12:45.665
And after dinner make
sure she brushes her teeth.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.507
Did you have fun
last night, honey?

12:54.541 --> 12:58.111
Yep, sian painted my nails
for me, aren't they pretty?

12:58.145 --> 13:00.213
They are
very pretty.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.417
Did you win anything
last night, daddy?

13:04.451 --> 13:05.485
What do you mean?

13:05.518 --> 13:08.088
Like, Uncle Tommy said,
did you get lucky?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.157
Ah, well daddy
didn't lose.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.725
Weren't you showing
me your nails?

13:14.061 --> 13:16.629
[Sound of car pulling into
drive way, breaks squealing]

13:22.402 --> 13:23.336
Hey!

13:23.370 --> 13:24.537
Hey.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.806
Hey missy, did
you have fun?

13:26.840 --> 13:30.410
Yep, sian painted my nails
for me aren't they pretty.

13:30.443 --> 13:31.744
They are beautiful.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.481
Come on, you can tell
me all about it.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.452
So what's the point in
having a daughter

13:39.486 --> 13:40.720
If you're only going to
dump her with your brother?

13:40.753 --> 13:42.389
Stace please,
don't start on me.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.723
I haven't done
anything wrong.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.626
Also you might want to move her
table set, I almost ran it over.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.229
Well, if you watched where
you're going, you wouldn't
run it over.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.198
She loves playing
with it out here.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.233
You fixed that broken
window in her room yet?

13:53.266 --> 13:55.502
No, when I
get some money,
I'll get someone

13:55.535 --> 13:56.769
Around to fix it.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.671
Look, stop being so stubborn, if
you let me in the house I'll fix

13:58.705 --> 13:59.672
It for you.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.041
I'll fix it when
I'm ready!

14:01.074 --> 14:02.575
Okay. It
closes fine.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.077
Okay fine, I'm
just offering.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.578
It's a pretty shady
area, but your call.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.882
Hey cutie, be a good girl, daddy
will call you through the week,

14:08.916 --> 14:09.917
I love you!

14:09.950 --> 14:11.451
I love you daddy!

14:39.712 --> 14:41.949
Shit surf.

14:41.982 --> 14:44.551
Yeah I know,
it's shocking.

14:46.219 --> 14:50.523
Look mate, I need to
talk to you about work.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.360
Why, what's the
scot's problem now?

14:53.393 --> 14:56.329
Na, it's not him, it's me.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.731
You know business has
been quiet for months.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.499
You're not getting
your boards out

14:59.532 --> 15:01.234
And you keep
turning up late.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.304
What do you mean, I bust my
arse off for that place.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.374
C'mon, you haven't for
months and you know it.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.279
So what, are you trying to
say I'm fired or something?

15:17.284 --> 15:18.952
Derek?

15:18.986 --> 15:20.487
Derek, are you
firing me?

15:20.520 --> 15:22.755
Things are really tight
right now, champ.

15:22.789 --> 15:23.991
We can't even
pay our bills.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.558
And we're behind
in our taxes.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.095
My hands are tied.

15:28.128 --> 15:29.329
Mate, this
is bullshit!

15:29.362 --> 15:30.430
You and I started
that place,

15:30.463 --> 15:33.000
And Colin came in
after we set it up.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.068
And you're
firing me?

15:35.102 --> 15:36.936
I'll lose my house
if I don't have a job!

15:36.970 --> 15:38.538
You'll get
another job.

15:38.571 --> 15:39.806
I don't need
a guilt trip.

15:39.839 --> 15:44.077
We'll all lose everything if I
don't do this, and you know it.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.912
Fuck the both of ya.

16:08.701 --> 16:09.702
Did you brush
your teeth?

16:09.736 --> 16:10.603
Yep.
Yeah?

16:10.637 --> 16:11.538
Let me smell.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.206
Good girl.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.841
Want your Teddy?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.877
Not that one, can I sleep
with my princess doll?

16:17.910 --> 16:19.512
Princess doll,
where's your princess doll?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.381
Over there.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.919
There you go, now she can
share your pillow with you.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.721
Did you have fun with
daddy this weekend?

16:28.755 --> 16:31.658
Yep, daddy got
lucky last night.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.426
Who told you that?

16:33.460 --> 16:35.028
Uncle Tommy.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.764
So that's why he dropped
you off over there.

16:37.797 --> 16:39.566
[Crickets chirping]

16:42.935 --> 16:44.937
Daddy told you to
fix the window.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.739
Yes, he did.

16:47.674 --> 16:48.775
Now don't be cheeky.

16:48.808 --> 16:51.078
Okay, mummy will see
you in the morning.

16:51.111 --> 16:52.979
Mwah. I love you.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.648
I love you, mummy.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.985
[Phone buzzing]

17:12.865 --> 17:14.834
What? Who's gone?

17:18.405 --> 17:22.040
[Phone ringing]

17:22.075 --> 17:23.510
Shit the bed, mate?

17:23.542 --> 17:26.279
I just got a call from Stacey
saying Georgia was missing.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.446
What? What do you
mean she's missing?

17:27.480 --> 17:29.116
I'm not sure. Stacey said she
went into Georgia's room

17:29.149 --> 17:30.750
And she wasn't there.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.618
She'll be okay, mate.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.819
I'm leaving now.

17:32.852 --> 17:34.053
What if something's
happened to her, mate?

17:34.087 --> 17:36.623
Don't even think like that
okay, I'll see you at Stacey's.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.225
I'm about twenty minutes
away. I'll see you there.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.975
What's going on?

17:56.008 --> 17:56.843
I don't know!

17:56.876 --> 17:57.644
How long has she
actually been missing?

17:57.677 --> 17:59.446
I woke up and
she was gone.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.314
Please sir, we have
officers in the house.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.782
Look I'm her father.
What's going on?

18:02.815 --> 18:04.384
No! It's a
crime scene.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.752
Look, just
wait outside.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.954
The detective will be
with you in a minute.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.890
[Sound of helicopter]

18:12.058 --> 18:13.126
Have you seen
my daughter?

18:13.160 --> 18:14.494
No, sorry I haven't.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.363
What about you?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.097
Have you seen
my daughter?
Georgia, blonde hair.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.399
She's only small;
Six years old.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.567
No, sorry, I haven't
seen anything.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.102
Oh come on! Has anyone
seen anything?

18:23.136 --> 18:24.371
You're the father,
I assume.

18:24.404 --> 18:27.240
No, no. Derek!
Derek! Come here!

18:28.341 --> 18:29.476
[Muffled talking between
detective Harris and Colin]

18:30.843 --> 18:31.911
Derek, is it?

18:31.944 --> 18:33.646
Detective Michael Harris,
sunshine coast civ.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.315
What's going on,
where's my daughter?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.650
From what we can tell, she was
taken from her bedroom through
an unlocked window.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.886
That fucking window!
I warned you about that window.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.154
Derek, now is not the time.

18:41.188 --> 18:43.089
Look, your friend is right, we
have police blocking off all the

18:43.122 --> 18:44.724
Streets in the neighborhood,
and we have more
officers arriving

18:44.757 --> 18:45.925
To door-knock and help
look for your daughter.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.759
Georgia!

18:46.793 --> 18:47.627
Sorry?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.128
Her name, my daughters
name is Georgia.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.331
Look, we'll do all we can
to find Georgia
as fast as possible.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.233
Do you have a
current photo of her?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.202
Stacey, how about you and me
go inside and find a current

18:55.235 --> 18:57.036
Picture of Georgia? Okay?

18:57.069 --> 18:59.071
So what now,
what can I do?
She's six years old, mate.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.174
I have a couple of
questions, if that's okay?

19:01.208 --> 19:03.042
Do you or your wife
have any enemies?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.244
Stacey's not my
wife, and no, I don't.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.412
I can't speak for her.

19:05.445 --> 19:06.813
Do you owe anyone large
amounts of money for any reason?

19:06.846 --> 19:08.815
Yeah, the tax department, what's
that got to do with anything?

19:08.848 --> 19:10.850
My daughter is gone, missing,
disappeared and you're playing

19:10.883 --> 19:12.118
Twenty friggin'
questions with me.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.287
Sorry, but we need to ask, the
smallest thing may lead

19:14.321 --> 19:15.488
Us to finding Georgia.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.089
Look, I promise we'll do
everything we can,

19:17.123 --> 19:18.591
But we'll need
your help also.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.726
Derek, what's going on?

19:19.759 --> 19:21.160
Look, I'll leave you for
now, we'll chat again later.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.530
I told Stacey about that
fucking window.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.664
What window?

19:24.697 --> 19:25.732
Ah, you mean the broken
window in Georgia's room.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.833
Yes!

19:26.866 --> 19:28.368
I thought you
fixed that ages ago?

19:28.401 --> 19:29.969
Is that where they're
saying she got out from?

19:30.002 --> 19:31.170
Not got out, she was taken.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.405
Georgia wouldn't
climb out that window.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.873
Okay, everyone listen up.

19:33.906 --> 19:37.544
We're looking for a six year
old girl. Her name is Georgia.

19:37.577 --> 19:40.413
This is the most current
photo we have of Georgia.

19:40.447 --> 19:42.782
We believe she was taken from
her bedroom some time between

19:42.815 --> 19:45.752
10 pm and 4 am
this morning.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.920
I would like to ask all the
neighbors of this street and

19:47.954 --> 19:50.723
Neighboring streets to check
in your backyards, under your

19:50.757 --> 19:54.994
Houses, in trees, sheds,
and even in your homes.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.665
If she has lost her way,
she will be cold and scared.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.735
If you do find her,
approach her carefully,
as not to startle her,

20:02.769 --> 20:05.905
And once again,
radio back to base.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.940
Excuse me.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.945
Alright. I've just heard
that there are
severe storms coming over.

20:12.979 --> 20:16.449
So let's get out there, guys,
and find this little girl,
and bring

20:16.483 --> 20:18.651
Her home safely to
her mum and dad.

20:20.052 --> 20:22.589
Georgia?

20:26.659 --> 20:27.727
Georgia!

20:30.330 --> 20:31.831
Georgia!

20:36.569 --> 20:39.171
Georgia!
Georgia!

20:53.853 --> 20:55.822
It's Derek.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.924
Yeah?

21:03.029 --> 21:05.732
Really?
Oh thank God!

21:05.765 --> 21:08.568
Yeah, yeah, I'll meet
you there, okay.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.136
Did they find her, love?

21:10.169 --> 21:15.207
Yeah, Derek overheard a
policeman saying they
found her at fisher's point.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.576
Oh, this is
great news!

21:16.609 --> 21:20.012
Oh, I told you
she'd be okay!

21:21.981 --> 21:23.215
Can someone drive
me there, please?

21:23.249 --> 21:24.951
Yeah, c'mon.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.721
Thank God, mate. I
was so worried.

21:28.755 --> 21:29.889
I know. Little bugger.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.124
She's got some
explaining to do, aye.

21:32.158 --> 21:35.161
Just as well, we caught her
before the storm
kicked in, mate.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.630
I'll wait here
for Stacey.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.415
Georgia!!!

23:55.034 --> 24:00.306
Please join with me as we
bow our heads in prayer.

24:00.339 --> 24:04.777
Our father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

24:04.811 --> 24:08.815
Thy kingdom come, thy will
be done, on earth as it is

24:08.848 --> 24:13.119
In heaven. Give us this day our
daily bread and forgive us our

24:13.152 --> 24:17.924
Trespasses, as we forgive those
who trespass against us,
and lead

24:17.957 --> 24:22.562
Us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil,
for thine is

24:22.595 --> 24:28.267
The kingdom, and the power, and
the glory, forever and ever,
amen.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.341
She's just a baby.

25:09.375 --> 25:13.012
She's just a baby.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.189
It was a beautiful
send off, Derek.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.596
If there's anything you need,
you'd just let me know, alright?

26:03.630 --> 26:05.965
Anything I can do?

26:05.998 --> 26:08.835
I just don't understand how any
of this could happen.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.336
Excuse me?!

26:10.369 --> 26:12.404
What did you
just say?!

26:12.438 --> 26:14.073
What did you say?

26:14.106 --> 26:15.775
You can't understand
how this happened?

26:15.808 --> 26:16.643
Derek.

26:16.676 --> 26:19.078
Are you serious,
tell me you're joking!

26:19.111 --> 26:20.913
Derek, don't!

26:20.947 --> 26:21.848
Derek, that's enough.

26:21.881 --> 26:23.616
Don't you dare tell
me that's enough!

26:23.650 --> 26:25.451
I told this stupid bitch
time and time again

26:25.484 --> 26:27.386
About that
fucking window!

26:27.419 --> 26:28.888
Go on, tell em!

26:28.921 --> 26:30.356
Fuck off!

26:30.389 --> 26:31.724
[Crying] This is
not my fault.

26:31.758 --> 26:33.359
Come on mate,
calm down.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.194
No you can all
just piss off!

26:35.227 --> 26:37.229
I'm sick of always
being the bad guy.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.965
I offered to fix that
window so many times,

26:38.998 --> 26:41.000
But you, yes you,
wouldn't let me.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.936
So because of your stupidity
and your stubbornness

26:43.970 --> 26:45.437
My daughter is dead.

26:45.471 --> 26:47.907
So don't you dare stand there
and say, how could this happen?

26:47.940 --> 26:50.342
I could tell you exactly
how this happened.

26:50.376 --> 26:51.577
Come on mate, you've
said your piece.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.912
I haven't even started
to say my piece.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.613
Come on, let's go
for a walk.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.653
Yeah well, we
were all thinking it.

27:03.089 --> 27:06.025
It's not my fault.
It's not my fault.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.770
God, baby, I miss
you so much.

27:17.804 --> 27:19.972
I miss you
too daddy.

27:21.841 --> 27:25.444
Sorry. I'm so sorry I wasn't
there to protect you.

27:25.477 --> 27:29.615
It's okay daddy.
It's not your fault.

27:29.648 --> 27:31.617
You know I love
you very much.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.087
To the moon and back.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.956
That's right.

27:36.989 --> 27:39.491
We say that to each other
all the time, don't we?

27:43.696 --> 27:46.465
Oy! Oy Derek, wake up.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.769
C'mon champ, this has
got to stop.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.804
Shit mate, not you too.

27:51.838 --> 27:55.241
Why don't you all give me time,
I've only just lost my daughter.

27:55.274 --> 27:56.843
I have a pretty good excuse.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.812
I know you have, but all you do
is stay trapped in this house.

27:59.846 --> 28:02.181
Every time I come around,
that TV is bloody blaring.

28:02.214 --> 28:04.550
Surprised the neighbors
haven't complained.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.755
Not as easy
as you think.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.827
She comes and visits
me every night.

28:15.995 --> 28:19.131
What do you mean she comes
and visits you every night?

28:20.632 --> 28:23.535
I'm not sure if
they're dreams or real.

28:24.804 --> 28:27.406
They seem so real
when she's here.

28:28.440 --> 28:30.609
We just lay
here and talk.

28:32.278 --> 28:34.680
They're just
dreams, my friend.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.949
Look, did you go to that
group I told you about?

28:39.585 --> 28:40.787
What group?

28:41.620 --> 28:45.825
Oh, the grieving
parents thing.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.894
No, I didn't.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.829
Are you
gonna go?

28:49.862 --> 28:51.864
Thinking about it.

28:51.898 --> 28:54.767
You should mate. They'll be
able to help you through this.

28:54.801 --> 28:56.803
It'll be awesome, you'll see.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.072
Now get yourself up,
we're going for a surf today.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.946
Yeah ok, let's go
for a surf.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.784
Do you want me to
call Tommy, see if he's
keen as well?

29:11.818 --> 29:13.385
I haven't seen him since the
funeral, so I really couldn't

29:13.419 --> 29:15.922
Give a shit if he comes or not.

29:24.263 --> 29:25.998
Thanks col, I needed this.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.200
Any time mate, you know that.

29:28.234 --> 29:32.004
Georgia loved coming
here and having a swim.

29:32.038 --> 29:33.272
Do you remember the
time she ran down

29:33.305 --> 29:36.775
To the water and fell
flat on her face?

29:36.809 --> 29:39.311
Well, that's one more thing
she won't ever do again.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.514
Listen, are you going to that
meeting tonight?

29:42.548 --> 29:43.682
What meeting?

29:43.715 --> 29:45.517
You know exactly
what meeting.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.353
Look I'm happy to come
along with you if you want.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.921
It'll be good
for you.

29:48.955 --> 29:51.958
I think you might be right.
Might do me some good.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.425
So you're going, then?

29:53.459 --> 29:56.395
If it means you'll leave me the
hell alone, then yes, I'll go.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.397
You're sure you don't
want me to come with you?

29:58.430 --> 30:02.368
Thanks, but I think I'll go
on my own, just listen in.

30:02.401 --> 30:03.335
Cool.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.995
Georgia, is that you?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.173
[Child laughter]

31:11.737 --> 31:13.472
Georgia?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.649
Georgia, is that you honey?

31:23.682 --> 31:29.155
[Creepy laughter]

31:45.271 --> 31:47.306
Hello daddy!

32:03.990 --> 32:05.157
Hello.

32:05.191 --> 32:10.096
Hey mate, how you going?

32:10.129 --> 32:14.533
Hey tom, I'm getting there.

32:14.566 --> 32:16.835
Haven't heard from
you since the funeral.

32:16.868 --> 32:21.573
Yeah sorry, I just had to deal
with it my own way, you know?

32:21.607 --> 32:25.344
Yeah, I understand,
seen mum and dad lately?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.346
Yeah, I was over
there last night.

32:27.379 --> 32:31.783
I think they're coming around
to see you, check up on
how you're going.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.486
Mum said you
really upset Tanya.

32:36.522 --> 32:38.057
Yeah, I'll have to call Tanya.

32:38.090 --> 32:43.062
Was a bit of a prick to her
when she came over,
forgot about that.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.130
Sian okay?

32:44.163 --> 32:48.200
Sian was fine,
mate, she understood.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.801
That's good.

32:49.835 --> 32:50.836
Tell her sorry for me.

32:50.869 --> 32:52.738
Will do.

32:52.771 --> 32:55.641
Hey, I'm having a
party this Saturday arvo.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.309
I want you to come over and
have a beer with me.

32:57.343 --> 32:58.710
I dunno, mate.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.879
I don't think I really want to
be around people
right now, you know.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.314
Oh, bullshit!

33:02.348 --> 33:06.118
You can't live your life
like a hermit forever, bro!

33:06.152 --> 33:08.820
Just, come over for a few hours.

33:08.854 --> 33:11.023
There'll be some
talent here, I promise.

33:13.359 --> 33:15.861
Yeah, I'll think about it.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.130
What time's this
shindig kicking off anyway?

33:18.164 --> 33:20.132
Ah, starting at
four, the barbecue.

33:20.166 --> 33:24.303
You better come, I'll be pissed
off it you don't.

33:24.336 --> 33:26.838
We'll see how
I'm going.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.908
Anyway, I better
get ready for work.

33:29.941 --> 33:34.580
I appreciate you calling
Tommy, means a lot to me.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.317
You know I love
you, little brother.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.419
I love you too, bro.

33:40.452 --> 33:43.089
See you Saturday.

33:43.122 --> 33:46.024
Oy! See you
Saturday, right?

33:46.058 --> 33:48.994
Okay, fair enough.
I'll let you know.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.730
Yeah, yeah, I'll annoy
you again in a few days.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.365
Later mate.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.872
Yeah, bye.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.328
I'm losing my shit.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.081
Hey mate, how
you goin'?

34:46.652 --> 34:48.120
Morning.

34:49.054 --> 34:50.688
I'm getting the
mackenzie job done.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.324
I finished the patch job on
that one over there,

34:52.358 --> 34:54.592
But I cant find
their job card.

34:54.626 --> 34:56.228
Oh, that's okay. That's the
feltch's board.

34:56.262 --> 34:57.763
Card for that's
in the office.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.764
You okay?

34:58.797 --> 35:00.566
What do you
mean, am I okay?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.100
Because I'm working, there
must be something wrong?

35:02.134 --> 35:03.902
Didn't mean to
offend you, mate.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.238
You just seem a little
different, that's all.

35:06.272 --> 35:08.374
Did you go to that
meeting last night?

35:08.407 --> 35:11.443
Those meetings are intense; Not
sure I really want to go back.

35:11.477 --> 35:15.714
I had to listen to this guy
talk about his daughter.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.650
Are you still having
dreams about Georgia?

35:22.188 --> 35:24.290
I got a call from
Tommy this morning.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.392
Oh yeah, what's the long
lost brother up to now?

35:26.425 --> 35:29.461
He's having a party this
weekend. Wants me to come.

35:29.495 --> 35:32.898
Probably needs someone
to cook the food.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.466
Ah, look I think
that's a great idea.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.734
You should go.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.869
One, you'll get to spend some
time with your little brother,

35:37.903 --> 35:40.672
And two, it might actually
take your mind off things.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.374
You never know, you'll probably
have fun.

35:42.408 --> 35:44.876
I dunno, Tommy's parties
are always over the top.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.212
I think it'd be great.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.580
And look, if it gets
too much, then just leave.

35:52.518 --> 35:54.720
Yeah, stuff it.
I will go.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.288
Be good to catch up with
tom and sian again,

35:56.322 --> 35:57.889
And have a quiet beer.

35:57.923 --> 35:58.724
There you go!

35:59.991 --> 36:02.361
Now can you turn the power back
on so we can make some money,

36:02.394 --> 36:04.563
And get the ato
off our backs?

36:04.596 --> 36:07.199
No worries, if you need me
I'll be out in front.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.477
Hello?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.178
Colin, it's detective
Harris here.

36:20.212 --> 36:21.647
Can I speak to
Derek please?

36:21.680 --> 36:23.349
Yeah I'll just get
him for you.

36:23.382 --> 36:26.485
Derek! That's detective
Harris on the phone.

36:32.724 --> 36:33.892
Hello?

36:33.925 --> 36:36.395
Hello Derek, this is detective
Harris here, how are you?

36:36.428 --> 36:37.929
Good, do you have
some news for me yet?

36:37.963 --> 36:40.131
Well, we have no new suspects,
but we're getting lots of calls

36:40.165 --> 36:41.933
From the public, people are
starting to come forward

36:41.967 --> 36:43.869
With new information.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.071
So have any of those callers
given you any information that

36:46.104 --> 36:47.806
Actually helps the case?

36:47.839 --> 36:49.675
Ya know, this has been going
on for over six months now,

36:49.708 --> 36:51.209
And you say the same
thing every time.

36:51.243 --> 36:54.012
Look I understand you're
frustrated, it can be hard work

36:54.045 --> 36:55.347
Sifting through all the
information we're getting,

36:55.381 --> 36:57.649
But I really believe we're
starting to get somewhere.

36:57.683 --> 37:00.185
We have one caller
recently mention seeing a man,

37:00.218 --> 37:02.921
Maybe early thirties, leaving
fisher's point around three A.M.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.291
We're getting the man to do a
sketch up of what he saw, but it

37:05.324 --> 37:08.594
Was dark, so I'm not sure we'll
get an accurate description.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.429
Well I appreciate your
efforts Michael,

37:10.462 --> 37:12.464
But as usual, I won't
hold my breath.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.333
Look I'll give you a call when
we get the sketch up and ready.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.134
You can come in and
have a look, you never know,

37:16.167 --> 37:17.836
It could be a
solid lead.

37:17.869 --> 37:20.272
Yep, thanks for
the call. Bye.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.273
Any news?

37:21.307 --> 37:23.041
Same shit, different day.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.811
They're useless pricks,
that's all I can say.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.414
I'm sorry mate, this'll
break, I can feel it.

37:28.447 --> 37:31.550
Someone will give this
fucker away, you'll see.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.586
Yeah, I've had enough for
today, I'm going home to relax.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.555
I'll finish
this tomorrow.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.757
That's okay, I'll look
after the jobs for today.

37:38.790 --> 37:40.459
Look, I'll give you a
call tomorrow,

37:40.492 --> 37:42.894
Maybe go for a surf
or something?

37:42.928 --> 37:47.098
Sounds like a plan.
Call me in the morning.

37:47.132 --> 37:49.301
- See ya later.
- See ya mate.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.329
Sorry about that.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.970
Hey! I was just
about to call you,
and here you are.

38:25.003 --> 38:27.005
Just sneaking off before
anyone knew I was here.

38:27.038 --> 38:29.475
What, you can' t leave
yet, you only just got here.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.243
Look around, sian, I don't fit
in with all these youngins.

38:32.277 --> 38:33.679
Don't be silly, and
besides you're not

38:33.712 --> 38:36.281
Going anywhere with that
dip. I love French onion!

38:36.314 --> 38:38.650
Come on, let's take
these inside.

38:46.692 --> 38:48.760
Come and have a
beer with me, man.

38:48.794 --> 38:50.962
Hey mate!

38:50.996 --> 38:53.331
Good to see Tommy's still got
it. He's pissed already.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.967
Better not, be he's supposed to
be cooking the food later.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.003
Anyway, here, pass me your
drinks, I'll put them
in the fridge.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.471
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.908
Hey!

39:03.442 --> 39:05.611
Awww, I love you bro!

39:05.644 --> 39:07.546
Ahh, I'm glad you came.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.747
Hey, you want a beer?

39:08.780 --> 39:11.249
Open your eyes, he's
already got one.

39:11.282 --> 39:12.784
Oh my gosh, Derek!

39:12.818 --> 39:15.353
Marissa, how are
you? Come here!

39:15.387 --> 39:16.855
Yeah, she's back
from Italy, mate.

39:16.888 --> 39:19.057
And she's hanging out
with her favorite cuz.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.258
Yeah, well, someone's
gotta help sian

39:20.291 --> 39:22.127
Look after this
crazy bugger.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.361
So, how you been, anyway?

39:23.395 --> 39:24.530
Yeah, day by day, you know.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.098
He's been great, he's here
to get plastered with me.

39:27.132 --> 39:30.602
Now go back out side and go and
have some fun.

39:33.038 --> 39:36.241
Damn bro, do we
have the hottest cousin or what!

39:36.274 --> 39:37.543
Tommy!

39:37.576 --> 39:39.611
What?
Is that not alright?

39:39.645 --> 39:41.547
Okay, moving along,

39:41.580 --> 39:44.416
Come out and talk to me.
Give me five minutes
then I'll come out.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.383
Oy!

39:45.417 --> 39:46.384
What?

39:46.418 --> 39:48.454
You can be so rude sometimes!

39:48.487 --> 39:49.455
Sorry!

39:49.488 --> 39:50.989
What's for dinner?

39:51.022 --> 39:53.759
We're having steak and sausages.

39:53.792 --> 39:57.763
(Laughs) And I'm going
to start cooking soon.

40:00.466 --> 40:04.402

42:49.400 --> 42:51.169
Hey man, what are ya doin'?

42:51.202 --> 42:53.171
Ah I was laying down, then I
remembered Stacey was going to

42:53.204 --> 42:55.140
Send me some pictures
of Georgia to my email.

42:55.173 --> 42:56.608
So I was hoping
to check it.

42:56.642 --> 42:58.009
If that's okay
with you.

42:58.043 --> 42:59.978
Yeah, that's
cool dude.

43:00.011 --> 43:02.480
Save some to my
desktop as well.

43:08.386 --> 43:11.489
Alright, after you've done
that, get your arse out here

43:11.522 --> 43:12.490
And have a brew with me.

43:12.523 --> 43:13.491
Tommy!

43:13.524 --> 43:15.460
Tommy, where
are you?

43:15.493 --> 43:18.697
Yeah, I'm coming.
Shit, settle down.

43:18.730 --> 43:21.499
Bloody women, aye.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.003
Hey, if you're not out
there in five minutes

43:25.036 --> 43:26.638
I'll have to drink
'em all on me own.

43:26.672 --> 43:28.674
Yeah, I'll be there, let

43:28.707 --> 43:30.175

44:20.591 --> 44:23.328
Derek are you
still in there?

44:23.361 --> 44:25.163
Hey! Tommy said you
had an email from

44:25.196 --> 44:26.664
Stacey with some
pictures of Georgia?

44:26.698 --> 44:28.033
Was wondering if I
could have a look?

44:28.066 --> 44:29.334
Ah, I wish, she hasn't
sent them yet.

44:29.367 --> 44:31.202
Ah, that sucks.

44:31.236 --> 44:32.637
Feeling any better?

44:32.670 --> 44:35.373
Not really.
Think I might go home
and go to sleep.

44:35.406 --> 44:37.709
Okay, I understand.

44:37.743 --> 44:39.544
C'mon, I'll take you out the
back so Tommy doesn't corner

44:39.577 --> 44:41.012
You for another drink.

44:41.046 --> 44:42.013
That'd be good.

44:42.047 --> 44:43.248
Think he needs a
sleep as well.

44:43.281 --> 44:45.250
Uh huh.

44:45.283 --> 44:46.651
Just give
me a sec.

your time.

Ben is a good looking kid,
but on the cheeky side.

45:42.908 --> 45:45.143
When I was younger, my
dad would beat me

45:45.176 --> 45:47.946
If I didn't do what
I was told.

45:47.979 --> 45:50.715
I warned Ben one day that he
would get into trouble

45:50.748 --> 45:51.950
If he didn't stop it.

45:51.983 --> 45:55.686
Of course, Ben
wouldn't listen to me.

45:55.720 --> 45:59.457
Don't worry dad,
I showed him.

46:09.134 --> 46:11.136
[Loud thud]

46:12.037 --> 46:13.839
[Loud thud]

46:16.207 --> 46:18.176
[Loud thud]

46:47.939 --> 46:51.509
Today was shit at work.
Colin's really pissing me off

46:51.542 --> 46:53.311
With all his nagging.

46:53.344 --> 46:56.347
Derek just stands
there and let's him do it.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.886
I had to release
some pressure.

48:49.794 --> 48:51.129
Derek?

48:53.164 --> 48:55.900
Derek? You
alright, mate?

48:55.933 --> 48:57.902
Sorry, I was off
with the fairies.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.004
Yeah, you
seemed to be.

48:59.037 --> 49:00.905
Are you here
to see me?

49:00.938 --> 49:03.108
No, I was walking past and
had a moment, I guess.

49:03.141 --> 49:05.776
What've you got
there, mate?

49:05.810 --> 49:07.478
What, this?

49:07.512 --> 49:09.747
Just book work for
the surf shop.

49:09.780 --> 49:10.881
Never ends, aye.

49:10.915 --> 49:12.783
Speaking of book work, I've got
that sketch for you,

49:12.817 --> 49:14.385
If you wanna come
in and see it?

49:14.419 --> 49:15.953
Is it okay if I come
back through the week?

49:15.987 --> 49:17.155
I've got a
lot on today.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.190
Sure, no problem.

49:19.224 --> 49:21.192
I can drop it down to
the store, if you like.

49:21.226 --> 49:22.793
Ah, that's right, I'm
taking off for a week.

49:22.827 --> 49:24.395
We can do it
when I get back.

49:24.429 --> 49:25.930
You sure? I can go
and get it.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.032
It'll only take
a few minutes.

49:27.065 --> 49:29.134
No, I don't have time today.
I've got to run.

49:29.167 --> 49:31.236
Look, I'll call you
when I get back.

49:31.269 --> 49:34.205
Alright, I'll talk to you
in a week or so, I guess.

49:45.483 --> 49:49.420
Here's one for ya:
Did you hear that story
about the

49:49.454 --> 49:52.823
Fella on the farm that
chopped his arm off,

49:52.857 --> 49:55.860
And to stop the bleeding,
he used a hot iron?

49:55.893 --> 49:57.928
Is that really
possible?

49:58.829 --> 50:01.299
If the iron's
super hot, yeah.

50:01.332 --> 50:05.070
You could try cauterizing
the wound to stop the bleeding.

50:05.103 --> 50:07.672
Probably destroy
the tissue though.

50:07.705 --> 50:10.341
Plus it'd hurt
like hell!

50:10.375 --> 50:12.877
Must have been
a brave man.

50:12.910 --> 50:15.746
Wouldn't someone pass
out from the pain though?

50:15.780 --> 50:19.016
The human body can
withstand so much pain.

50:19.050 --> 50:21.652
Most of us will never have
to go through what we're

50:21.686 --> 50:23.454
Truly capable
of handling.

50:23.488 --> 50:25.223
Thank God.

50:25.256 --> 50:28.893
Hey doc, I was watching YouTube
the other day and I saw this

50:28.926 --> 50:31.629
Footage of a dentist in
Germany or something...

50:31.662 --> 50:33.898
He was smoking and
looked to be drunk.

50:33.931 --> 50:36.467
He was pulling this guy's teeth
out, and jeeze it looked brutal.

50:36.501 --> 50:38.769
Yes, I've seen
that one.

50:38.803 --> 50:40.405
That is without doubt
the roughest dental work

50:40.438 --> 50:41.606
I've ever seen.

50:41.639 --> 50:43.941
Ah, the guy in the chair was
losing so much blood,

50:43.974 --> 50:45.676
Surely it wouldn't have
happened like that,

50:45.710 --> 50:47.412
Or he could have at least
stopped the bleeding?

50:47.445 --> 50:51.048
Well, there are right ways and
wrong ways to extract a tooth.

50:51.082 --> 50:53.351
Naturally, we use the
proper tools to do it.

50:53.384 --> 50:58.189
For example, ah let's see, this
one here is designed to get down

50:58.223 --> 50:59.657
Inside the gum.

50:59.690 --> 51:03.528
And ah this little baby, which
just happens to be my favorite,

51:03.561 --> 51:05.530
Is designed to
pull the tooth out.

51:05.563 --> 51:08.266
How about the days where
people were tortured though?

51:08.299 --> 51:10.501
They didn't have all this fancy
equipment we have today to keep

51:10.535 --> 51:13.171
People awake, or
alive for that matter.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.277
It's all about
conditioning, mate.

51:20.178 --> 51:22.079
Conditioning?

51:22.113 --> 51:24.749
What the hell are you
talking about, you piss head?

51:26.217 --> 51:30.121
Well, you know how, ah,
you go for a run and

51:30.155 --> 51:32.056
On the first day
you run a "k."

51:32.089 --> 51:33.124
Yeah?

51:33.158 --> 51:35.626
Yeah, and if you ran every
other day you'd be able

51:35.660 --> 51:37.328
To run further,
right?

51:37.362 --> 51:38.329
For sure.

51:38.363 --> 51:40.665
Yeah, so torturing
someone's the same.

51:40.698 --> 51:45.703
It's all about conditioning
the person's pain threshold.

51:45.736 --> 51:48.306
What they used to do was
push you to the limit

51:48.339 --> 51:51.242
Where you'd be about to
pass out, then stop.

51:51.276 --> 51:54.445
Then come back the next day
and push you even further.

51:54.479 --> 52:00.218
It's really a mental tug of war
between your brain and the pain.

52:00.251 --> 52:03.454
Eventually they'd
pass out, though.

52:03.488 --> 52:06.023
Well, how would you
wake 'em up if they
did pass out?

52:06.056 --> 52:10.027
Its not overly hard,
you can get products over
the counter to do that.

52:10.060 --> 52:13.130
Smelling salts have been around
since at least the seventeenth

52:13.164 --> 52:17.302
Century to help revive a
person that's passed out.

52:17.335 --> 52:20.971
And they work because the
ammonia gas irritates the lungs

52:21.005 --> 52:23.073
And triggers and
inhalation reflex.

52:23.107 --> 52:25.610
Which then wakes
you up, easy as!

52:25.643 --> 52:27.545
Sounds like it.

53:25.403 --> 53:26.271
Welcome!

53:26.304 --> 53:29.540
Hey, yeah, it's been
a while.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.010
Another
beer, mate?

53:33.043 --> 53:35.045
Does a bear shit in the
woods? [Laughs]

53:36.914 --> 53:38.283
What, have you been
throwing down a few?

53:38.316 --> 53:40.985
Ah, I'm on me fourth.

53:41.018 --> 53:43.254
So, when's the
misses get back?

53:43.288 --> 53:47.692
I dunno. Five, six
days, maybe a week.

53:48.693 --> 53:49.894
Party time at
your place?

53:51.028 --> 53:53.498
Hell yeah, hasn't
stopped mate.

53:56.934 --> 54:00.170
Home brew's the
best. Cheers.

54:03.140 --> 54:06.110
So, how you
going, mate?

54:06.143 --> 54:08.479
You coping with
it all okay?

54:08.513 --> 54:12.182
Yeah, I'd feel a lot better if
they just caught the fucker.

54:12.216 --> 54:13.584
Yeah.

54:14.419 --> 54:16.454
Are the cops
even doing anything?

54:16.487 --> 54:18.923
It just seems like they have
no leads at all.

54:18.956 --> 54:22.293
Yeah, that's the problem.
They have no clue.

54:22.327 --> 54:24.194
I don't think they'll
ever catch who did this.

54:25.330 --> 54:27.532
They said they had
no forensic evidence.

54:27.565 --> 54:28.999
All they have is
some old bastard

54:29.033 --> 54:31.536
Who saw someone
around three A.M.

54:31.569 --> 54:33.504
But detective Harris reckons
nothing will come of that

54:33.538 --> 54:35.873
Because it was too dark to get
a good look at the guy.

54:35.906 --> 54:38.108
Shit, that
sucks mate.

54:40.845 --> 54:44.982
So did the old guy say
anything about what he saw?

54:45.015 --> 54:47.552
Only that the guy he saw
looked to be
late twenties, early

54:47.585 --> 54:49.587
Thirties, but
nothing will come of it.

54:49.620 --> 54:53.090
This bastard will
get away with it.

54:53.123 --> 54:56.327
Slow down there, turbo, you
don't wanna injure yourself.

54:56.361 --> 55:00.865
Mate, I'll drink you under the
table any day of the week.

55:00.898 --> 55:04.769
How about you show me this pool
room, and I'll kick your arse.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.270
You're on.

55:09.807 --> 55:13.478
Jeeze, strong
brews mate!

55:13.511 --> 55:15.413
You alright there?

55:15.446 --> 55:18.115
Yeah I'm good, just a
little dizzy, that's all.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.985
Is that going to be your
excuse when I smash ya?

55:21.018 --> 55:25.723
[Laughs]
You wish mate.

55:25.756 --> 55:27.658
[Thud. Glass breaking]

55:30.060 --> 55:34.832
[Sound of screwing
from drill]

55:50.381 --> 55:52.683
[Gargling sounds from
Tommy's tracheotomy]

56:01.559 --> 56:05.229
You're okay, just
take your time.

56:07.932 --> 56:12.903
Tommy, you can't move. You're
bolted down to the table.

56:16.140 --> 56:18.543
Oh, I've performed
a tracheotomy on you

56:18.576 --> 56:20.945
So you can't
talk either.

56:20.978 --> 56:23.347
It's amazing what you can
learn on the net these days.

56:23.380 --> 56:27.284
The only way you can talk
is if I block that hole.

56:49.540 --> 56:51.909
I wouldn't go throwing your
head around either.

56:51.942 --> 56:54.244
There are pretty sharp spikes
pointed at your skull.

56:54.278 --> 56:56.681
I reckon it'd hurt a
lot if you hit em'.

57:06.023 --> 57:08.258
[Sound of wing
nuts tightening]

57:15.700 --> 57:19.269
Now, what are you trying to
say? [Gargling stops]

57:20.505 --> 57:22.640
What are you doing?

57:22.673 --> 57:26.644
Ah! Come off it tom,
don't act like you don't know!

57:26.677 --> 57:30.648
If you tell me the truth
right now, I'll let you go.

57:32.917 --> 57:35.452
Truth about what?

57:45.162 --> 57:48.332
I'm going to give you one more
chance to tell me the truth.

57:48.365 --> 57:50.535
This is it.

57:50.568 --> 57:52.670
If the next words outta'
your mouth are not what

57:52.703 --> 57:55.740
I want to hear,
well fuck ya then.

58:00.511 --> 58:02.980
So you wanna
confess?

58:03.013 --> 58:05.149
What have I done?

58:09.787 --> 58:10.821
You know what pisses
me off the most

58:10.855 --> 58:12.389
About having a
pool table?

58:12.422 --> 58:16.694
People always spill crap on
them and wreck the felt.

58:28.739 --> 58:30.040
Look what you
have done, Tommy.

58:30.074 --> 58:32.376
You are bleeding
on my table.

58:32.409 --> 58:35.412
Shit. Well now I have to
stop the bleeding.

58:40.484 --> 58:42.953
[Gargling and screaming]

58:48.325 --> 58:51.261
[Sizzling skin sounds, gas
sound coming from torch]

58:55.900 --> 58:58.836
[Tommy screaming
and gasping]

59:27.531 --> 59:29.667
I did it.

59:29.700 --> 59:33.503
You did what?

59:33.537 --> 59:35.239
I killed her.

59:35.272 --> 59:37.708
I have your diary, I know
exactly what you did to my

59:37.742 --> 59:40.778
Daughter, you sick prick.

59:41.445 --> 59:44.048
She was six years old.

59:44.081 --> 59:47.952
You killed Georgia because you
where mad at Colin and me.

59:47.985 --> 59:50.888
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

59:53.423 --> 59:56.560
And she wasn't
the only one.

59:56.593 --> 01:00:00.397
You're a child killer,
rapist, pedophile.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.667
You're scum!

01:00:08.605 --> 01:00:10.240
Don't bother Tommy. I
cut out your throat

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.476
So I didn't have to
listen to your dribble.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:19.016
How old was Georgia?

01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:22.286
She was six.

01:00:22.319 --> 01:00:25.022
For every year she was alive
you're going to get tortured

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.556
For a whole day.

01:00:26.590 --> 01:00:29.626
Six years equals
six days.

01:00:29.660 --> 01:00:31.361
And when I say tortured, I
mean I'm going to cause you so

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:34.832
Much fucking pain you'll
wish you were never born!

01:00:34.865 --> 01:00:36.633
You are not my brother!

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:38.969
The only thing I wanna hear
coming out of your mouth is you

01:00:39.003 --> 01:00:41.706
Yelling from the
pain I'm causing you.

01:00:49.446 --> 01:00:52.249
That looks like it's
pretty painful.

01:01:36.593 --> 01:01:38.495
That should hold you
down for a while.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.230
I'm going to
see Colin.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:43.467
You just stay there, and
I'll be back soon.

01:01:52.877 --> 01:01:54.979
You seem in
good spirits today!

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:57.514
Do I?

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:59.716
That week off seems to
have done you a world of good.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.551
What'd you get up to?

01:02:01.585 --> 01:02:03.754
I rebuilt my
pool room.

01:02:03.788 --> 01:02:06.123
Looks good now.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:08.458
So we're on for a pool
comp soon then?

01:02:08.492 --> 01:02:10.394
Hell yeah!

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:12.262
I'm ordering new felt for the
old girl next week.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.932
Once I have that,
we'll get into it.

01:02:16.266 --> 01:02:20.170
So, when're you
coming back to the shop?

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:23.073
Hmm, give me a
few more days.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:25.342
I have a few things
to finish up.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:28.345
Then I'm all yours.

01:02:28.378 --> 01:02:32.149
Good to have you back, mate.
Take all the time you need.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:40.357
Now I have a story
for you Tommy.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.059
I really don't think you're
going to wanna hear it,

01:02:42.092 --> 01:02:44.561
But I'm going to tell
you anyway.

01:02:45.896 --> 01:02:48.032
It's about that little
boy in england.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:53.871
Five year old that was taken
from the shopping centre.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:57.507
Did you ever hear
about that little boy?

01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.177
Ah, it's a sad
story really.

01:03:01.178 --> 01:03:04.281
This little boy was
shopping with his mother.

01:03:05.682 --> 01:03:08.919
Then the next thing
you know, he's gone.

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:12.957
Taken by two ten
year old boys.

01:03:13.858 --> 01:03:14.959
They took him down
to the train tracks

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.694
And did the most horrific
things to him.

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:20.564
They even cut off
his fingers.

01:03:20.597 --> 01:03:23.433
When I read this, Tommy,
after losing Georgia,

01:03:23.467 --> 01:03:26.203
I really felt for that family.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:30.574
So for the sake of justice
I'm gonna cut off your fingers.

01:03:30.607 --> 01:03:32.943
One at a time.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:36.646
Hold that thought!

01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:38.682
Nearly forgot
the wax!

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.685
Need to make sure
this wax is melted

01:03:41.718 --> 01:03:44.221
So you don't
bleed everywhere.

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:56.867
This will be a lot easier
if you don't move.

01:03:56.901 --> 01:04:00.837
[Tommy screaming]

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.956
Okay, okay!
I've stopped.

01:04:18.989 --> 01:04:20.224
I don't know
why you're upset.

01:04:20.257 --> 01:04:22.726
I only cut off two
of your fingers!

01:04:32.169 --> 01:04:35.472
Now the wax is to
stop the bleeding...

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:41.011
But it won't stick
with all this blood.

01:04:41.045 --> 01:04:43.580
Let's get you
cleaned up.

01:04:59.296 --> 01:05:01.966
[Phone ringing]

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:02.832
Good timing!

01:05:02.866 --> 01:05:04.768
Mum's calling.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:10.941
Mother!

01:05:10.975 --> 01:05:12.176
[Tommy banging on table,
plastic, muffled noises.]

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:15.179
Nah, just waxing
some stuff.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:20.117
Yeah sure, what time
where you thinking?

01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:22.152
Okay cool. See ya
then, yeah...

01:05:22.186 --> 01:05:24.021
I better finish
this waxing.

01:05:25.622 --> 01:05:27.791
I love you too.

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:34.064
Mum and dad are
coming to visit.

01:05:34.898 --> 01:05:37.234
I better get organized.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.707
[Tommy moaning]

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.882
Don't worry, I'll bring
you down some food.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:28.718
Can't have you starving
to death on me.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.402
I got a call from that
detective the other day.

01:06:45.435 --> 01:06:46.970
What did he have to say?

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.872
It's been nearly
six months.

01:06:48.905 --> 01:06:52.242
Not too much as usual,
apparently some old guy saw

01:06:52.276 --> 01:06:55.412
Someone around three a, m,
walking out of fishers point.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:57.414
Although it was dark, the cops
are getting a sketch artist to

01:06:57.447 --> 01:06:59.783
Draw up a picture of
what the old fart saw.

01:06:59.816 --> 01:07:03.553
(Laughs) Don't say that.
Hey dad, do you remember

01:07:03.587 --> 01:07:07.791
That girl that was killed, uh,
shit, like twelve years ago on

01:07:07.824 --> 01:07:09.926
The coast, the young girl?

01:07:09.959 --> 01:07:11.728
Alison karney. Is
that who you mean?

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:16.900
Yeah, that's the one, what'd
they do to her killer
in jail again?

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:20.604
Jeeze son, I can't
really remember.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.607
Hang on, just gotta put
my washing in the dryer.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.875
Be back in a second.

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:52.669
Gotta love
clothes dryers.

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.638
I was just saying
that we should get going,

01:07:54.671 --> 01:07:57.207
Your father wants to
watch the footy.

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:02.412
I just remembered what they
did to that guy in prison.

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.281
Really?

01:08:06.116 --> 01:08:08.718
Hey, Tommy
you awake?

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.255
I was just chatting with
dad upstairs, and

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:13.990
He told me what he wants me to
do to you for killing Georgia.

01:08:14.023 --> 01:08:16.993
So tomorrow we'll do dad's
idea, just to make him happy.

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:20.163
You know how he's always gotta
throw his two Bob's worth in.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:25.469
Righto, well I'm off to bed.
We have a big day tomorrow.

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:31.175
What'd you say?

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:33.277
Just kill me.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:36.746
Oh, I will kill you mate,
don't you worry about that.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.915
Everything you did to Georgia
will come back ten fold,

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.116
Starting tomorrow.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.386
Sleep well.

01:08:43.886 --> 01:08:46.089
Do you want me to
leave this or take it out?

01:08:46.122 --> 01:08:47.724
(Softly) Leave it.

01:08:47.756 --> 01:08:48.758
I can't hear you
properly.

01:08:48.792 --> 01:08:50.859
You want me to
twist it a little?

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:53.363
It's kinda weird,
but okay!

01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:03.973
(Laughing) Aye?

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:11.515
Night bro!

01:09:25.729 --> 01:09:27.063
Hey Tommy!

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:28.497
Check this out.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.799
Guess where this
is going to go.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.568
What? No idea?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.136
Up your
arse, mate!

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.938
Hey, don't panic!

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.139
I have lube.

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.408
You don't think I'd just
ram it up there, do you?

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:40.644
Now your probably wondering
why I wanna stick a pipe up your

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:42.078
Arse right?

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:44.247
Well that's where
this comes into it.

01:09:44.281 --> 01:09:46.850
See I'm going to stick the
barbed wire up the pipe and into

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:48.084
Your guts.

01:09:48.117 --> 01:09:50.185
Then I'm going to remove the
tube and leave it up there.

01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:51.354
You excited?

01:09:51.388 --> 01:09:52.322
I am!

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:54.258
I told you we had a
big day ahead of us.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:59.463
I enjoyed killing her...

01:09:59.496 --> 01:10:02.432
What'd you say
about Georgia?

01:10:05.935 --> 01:10:08.972
Oh God, I'm sorry.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:12.141
I hope this fucking hurts,
you little prick.

01:10:27.491 --> 01:10:30.494
Oh, this is
sharp shit.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:44.941
I bet you wish I
used lube now.

01:10:51.281 --> 01:10:54.484
Please Derek, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.608
We seem to be stuck!

01:11:19.743 --> 01:11:24.381
I wonder if it's your guts. Or
if it's the pipe.

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:57.947
Hey Colin!

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:59.048
How's business?

01:11:59.082 --> 01:12:00.249
Yeah, things are
picking up.

01:12:00.283 --> 01:12:01.217
What can I do
for you?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:02.552
I'm just here to
see Derek.

01:12:02.586 --> 01:12:03.853
We have a sketch
for him to look at.

01:12:03.887 --> 01:12:06.556
Ah yeah he mentioned you
had a witness or something.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:08.858
He's not actually in today, he's
got a few days off.

01:12:08.892 --> 01:12:11.761
Ah, we'll find him
at home then?

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.464
Definitely. He's working on a
pool room. Really good for him.

01:12:14.498 --> 01:12:15.565
Giving him something
to do, you know.

01:12:15.599 --> 01:12:17.501
That's great.

01:12:18.502 --> 01:12:20.504
Uh, actually,

01:12:20.537 --> 01:12:22.972
While we're here, could you
have a look at this sketch?

01:12:23.006 --> 01:12:25.274
Sure, anything
to help.

01:12:35.419 --> 01:12:38.087
You know who that
is, don't you?

01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:41.758
Thanks for your help.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.966
Come on, wake
up, Tommy.

01:12:49.999 --> 01:12:51.768
Oy Tommy, can
you hear me?

01:12:53.970 --> 01:12:56.540
[Gargling from
tracheotomy]

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:58.074
Oh thank God!

01:12:58.107 --> 01:13:00.043
I thought I might have
lost you there for a minute.

01:13:00.076 --> 01:13:01.911
Might have pushed you a
bit hard yesterday...

01:13:01.945 --> 01:13:04.013
What doesn't
kill you, right?

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:08.418
Can't have you nodding off
and missing everything.

01:13:13.857 --> 01:13:18.962
[Screaming, sounds of barbed
wire grating along pipe]

01:13:30.173 --> 01:13:34.944
Yep, might have to do
that in sections, mate.

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:38.047
While we wait, how
about we read a little?

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:46.623
Recognize this?

01:13:47.724 --> 01:13:49.626
There are three stories
in here I think we need

01:13:49.659 --> 01:13:52.796
To seriously
discuss, don't you?

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:56.800
And to save us time I've
highlighted the important parts.

01:13:56.833 --> 01:13:59.769
Let's talk about
little Ben.

01:13:59.803 --> 01:14:02.271
He was ten years
old, Tommy.

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:06.743
What would make any man want
to hurt a ten year old boy?

01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:10.146
Do you know I've met
Ben's older sister?

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:13.216
Let me tell you,
she is pissed off.

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:16.252
She'd cause you a lot of pain
too, but well,
she can't be here,

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.755
So I guess I'll
need to do it for her.

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:24.427
Now you say you broke his
knees so he couldn't run away.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.731
Well, I did some research
on knee breaking.

01:14:40.043 --> 01:14:43.713
And I thought
you'd appreciate this!

01:14:43.747 --> 01:14:45.782
I found the
plans on Google.

01:14:45.815 --> 01:14:46.583
The knee splitter.

01:14:46.616 --> 01:14:49.152
[Sound of metal
grinding]

01:14:49.185 --> 01:14:53.122
So for little Ben and his older
sister, I made one just for you.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:56.159
What's say we try
this baby out?

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:59.696
[Tommy breathing
faster, plastic rustling]

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:02.398
[Sound of knee splitter
being jammed onto knee]

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:05.969
[Tommy screaming]

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:21.751
Don't you dare pass out, you
coward! You can handle it!

01:15:21.785 --> 01:15:24.320
Ben was ten years old when you
smashed his knee caps!

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.190
It's all about conditioning,
remember? You can take it!

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.524
You think this is bad?

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:32.361
Wait 'til you see whats
coming, this is nothing tom!

01:15:32.395 --> 01:15:35.665
I loved you, you were my
brother, and all along you were

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.033
The worst scum of
the earth.

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:38.835
You fucking
disgust me.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:40.704
You still have two days left
to pay for what you did.

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:41.871
You piece of shit!

01:15:41.905 --> 01:15:43.840
Suck it up!

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:05.228
Are you doing bad stuff
to Uncle Tommy?

01:16:05.261 --> 01:16:08.331
Yes baby, I'm teaching
him a lesson.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.366
Uncle Tommy is a
bad man.

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:14.237
Does it make you feel
happy to hurt Uncle Tommy?

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:17.106
No baby, hurting
people is bad,

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:19.943
But sometimes really bad people
deserve to be punished.

01:16:19.976 --> 01:16:22.846
Daddy, you said when people are
bad to call the policeman, and

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:26.082
The policeman will
put them in jail.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.452
I just want Uncle
Tommy to never forget

01:16:29.485 --> 01:16:31.487
What he has put
us through,

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.289
Then daddy will
call the police.

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:34.290
Promise?

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:35.925
Yes baby, I
promise.

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:37.560
I love you, daddy.

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:40.196
I love you too,
baby girl.

01:16:54.811 --> 01:16:56.479
I come down here to
give you a drink

01:16:56.512 --> 01:16:59.849
And look what you've
done to yourself, Tommy.

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:07.657
Seriously Houdini, what's
the plan of attack here?

01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:10.193
Shred your last good hand
getting loose, then you have to

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:12.495
Free your head from those
spikes, which is pretty
bloody hard even

01:17:12.528 --> 01:17:14.530
For me, and I made the fucker!

01:17:14.563 --> 01:17:18.634
After all that, you have to
free your ankles. Then what?

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:21.337
Run out of here on a broken knee
with two feet of barbed wire

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.571
Sticking out of your arse?

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:26.710
How the fuck did you
get away with murder?

01:17:26.743 --> 01:17:30.847
Mmm. That's right,
you didn't.

01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:36.285
[Coughing]

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.091
Well I guess this
hand's gotta go!

01:17:49.465 --> 01:17:50.566
Please, Derek.

01:17:50.599 --> 01:17:52.668
Don't bother!

01:18:05.715 --> 01:18:09.252
[Door bell rings]
Who the hell is that?

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:16.125
Some people have
bad timing.

01:18:24.567 --> 01:18:26.369
Might be around
the back?

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:27.403
[Door bell rings]

01:18:27.436 --> 01:18:30.439
Okay, okay, settle
down, I'm comin'.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:35.879
Ah Michael,
how's things?

01:18:35.912 --> 01:18:37.613
Morning Derek,
sorry to bother you.

01:18:37.646 --> 01:18:38.815
Got a few minutes?

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:41.417
Yeah sure, come in.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:43.452
Excuse the mess.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.361
Sit down guys, you want
a coffee or something?

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:54.998
Ah, no thanks. We
won't hold you up.

01:18:55.031 --> 01:18:57.233
We called into the store
to see you, but, ah,

01:18:57.266 --> 01:18:59.168
Colin said you were
having a few days off.

01:18:59.202 --> 01:19:01.137
Yeah that's right,
taking a few more days,

01:19:01.170 --> 01:19:03.439
Then heading
back in next week.

01:19:03.472 --> 01:19:05.574
So what's this about, do
you have some news for me?

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:07.977
Actually I think we might,
we called into the surf shop

01:19:08.011 --> 01:19:09.578
Yesterday to show you this.

01:19:09.612 --> 01:19:11.614
When Colin saw it, he thought it
looked exactly like your

01:19:11.647 --> 01:19:12.782
Brother Thomas.

01:19:12.816 --> 01:19:16.986
Detective Harris! Detective
Harris (Raspy) [Coughing]

01:19:19.022 --> 01:19:22.391
I guess it looks like
Tommy a little.

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:24.427
Wait, you don't think Tommy's
the guy who did this?

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:28.264
Well, no, but we certainly
would like to talk to him.

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:30.766
We dropped into his house the
other day, but he wasn't there.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.268
You heard from him
at all lately?

01:19:32.301 --> 01:19:34.737
[Tommy crying]

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:36.472
Derek, have you
heard from him?

01:19:36.505 --> 01:19:41.177
Um no, no, um, Tommy
does his own thing.

01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:42.879
Although mum and dad did
ask me the other night

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:45.381
When they were over if
I'd seen him.

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:47.283
I think he went away
with his girlfriend.

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.853
She's a photographer and had
a job out west.

01:19:49.886 --> 01:19:52.488
I tried to call her but she
had no reception.

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:55.024
Fair enough. Do you know
when they're getting back?

01:19:55.058 --> 01:19:57.460
Saturday or Sunday
I believe?

01:19:57.493 --> 01:20:02.331
Okay well, I think
that's all we need for now.

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:05.634
Oh, um, if you do hear
from your brother,

01:20:05.668 --> 01:20:07.070
Tell him to give
me a call.

01:20:07.103 --> 01:20:09.805
[Choking]

01:20:17.413 --> 01:20:21.584
Now, let's talk
about kelsie.

01:20:21.617 --> 01:20:23.819
What'd she ever
do to you?

01:20:23.853 --> 01:20:25.922
What was it about her that
made you take her out to

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:29.125
The bush to rape
and kill her?

01:20:29.158 --> 01:20:31.594
The part that really gets me
is that you had a beautiful

01:20:31.627 --> 01:20:35.899
Girlfriend and you chose to
rape a fifteen year old girl.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:38.968
And to think, sian said
she'd want you in jail.

01:20:39.002 --> 01:20:40.336
Pedophiles
get what?

01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.271
Couple of years, then they're
let out to do it again?

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:45.274
Not really
effective, is it?

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:48.777
Perhaps you'd like to see
what it feels like to be raped?

01:20:52.348 --> 01:20:55.451
[Coughing]
Pease Derek.

01:21:06.129 --> 01:21:07.163
Did that hurt?

01:21:07.196 --> 01:21:08.932
Did that hurt?

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:10.533
If you don't answer
me, I'll do it again!

01:21:10.566 --> 01:21:12.035
Did that hurt?

01:21:12.068 --> 01:21:14.103
(Raspy) Yes!

01:21:14.137 --> 01:21:17.240
Now you know how
kelsie felt!

01:21:21.978 --> 01:21:24.981
I see our conditioning is coming
along quite well.

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:27.750
Might be time to
push it up a notch.

01:21:27.783 --> 01:21:31.087
There was a little boy in
Western Australia that was

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:32.956
Beaten by his stepfather.

01:21:32.989 --> 01:21:35.158
Ya' know how he did it?

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:38.861
He put the phone
book on him, like this.

01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:46.435
Then beat him
with a hammer.

01:21:49.205 --> 01:21:52.976
Now you can't tell me that hurt.
I think you can take more!

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.014
Now that's gotta hurt!

01:21:58.047 --> 01:22:00.283
I bet you're finding
it hard to breathe!

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:21.937
I need a break, Tommy!
This is hard work!

01:22:21.971 --> 01:22:24.007
You have a rest. We have
a lot to get to

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:25.408
In the next 24 hours.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:28.411
Tomorrow we talk about
Georgia, but today,

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.913
Well, today it's
about kelsie.

01:22:32.548 --> 01:22:34.383
I have a question
for you Tommy.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.552
You going to tell
me the truth?

01:22:37.420 --> 01:22:39.222
Water!

01:22:39.255 --> 01:22:42.058
Sure, but then you'll
tell me what I wanna know.

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:43.359
Deal?

01:22:43.392 --> 01:22:44.994
Yes.

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:55.238
That's enough.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:04.247
Now as you can tell,
I have a hammer,

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:07.083
And this time there
is no phone book.

01:23:07.116 --> 01:23:10.719
You mess me around I'll
crack you with this hammer.

01:23:10.753 --> 01:23:14.123
Where is kelsie's body?

01:23:14.157 --> 01:23:16.259
Speak.

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:24.867
The old cane shed,
just off the high way.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:28.137
We used to play
there as kids.

01:23:28.171 --> 01:23:29.938
So if I was to call the cops
right now and tell them

01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:32.608
To head out there,
they'll find her body, right?

01:23:32.641 --> 01:23:37.180
Yes, buried under
an old steel pile.

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:42.151
That wasn't so hard, and
I didn't have to hit you.

01:23:44.887 --> 01:23:47.956
That's for raping
and killing her!

01:24:00.002 --> 01:24:02.971
I have some information on
a missing 15 year old girl,

01:24:03.005 --> 01:24:05.908
Her name is kelsie Taylor, her
body can be found under a pile

01:24:05.941 --> 01:24:09.345
Of steel behind an old cane
shed just off the Bruce highway.

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:10.879
North of the
sunshine coast.

01:24:10.913 --> 01:24:12.381
You can't miss
the cane farm.

01:24:12.415 --> 01:24:14.117
Good luck.

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:40.609
Look at the
master at work.

01:24:42.411 --> 01:24:43.979
What're you
building, Georgia?

01:24:44.012 --> 01:24:46.382
A sand castle.

01:24:47.983 --> 01:24:49.618
Maybe we could live
there one day?

01:24:49.652 --> 01:24:51.954
No we cant,
silly Billy.

01:24:51.987 --> 01:24:53.222
Why can't we
live there?

01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:55.958
Because it's made
out of sand!

01:24:55.991 --> 01:24:58.827
You're so smart baby. How
much do you love daddy?

01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:02.030
Daddy, you know
how much!

01:25:05.301 --> 01:25:06.702
Now, leave
it, leave it!

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:09.638
Leave you, the professional.

01:25:12.375 --> 01:25:15.744
[Tommy gargling in
his sleep]

01:26:00.122 --> 01:26:02.358
[Sound of tape ripping]

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:41.230
"I opened her window
and climbed inside."

01:26:41.264 --> 01:26:43.799
I knew about the window
from Derek telling me how Stacy

01:26:43.832 --> 01:26:46.535
Wouldn't let him fix it.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:51.740
I picked up Georgia out of
her bed. She woke slightly
and I told

01:26:51.774 --> 01:26:58.146
Her it's okay, it's Uncle
Tommy. Go back to sleep.

01:26:58.180 --> 01:27:01.216
I climbed out the
window with her.

01:27:01.250 --> 01:27:05.688
She woke again and I said we
were going to see her dad

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.324
And for her to go
back to sleep.

01:27:09.992 --> 01:27:14.997
I took her up the road to my car
and laid her on the back seat.

01:27:17.333 --> 01:27:19.502
I don't know why, Georgia.

01:27:19.535 --> 01:27:22.104
I didn't really want to take
her, but I was so angry at Derek

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:25.708
For firing me and
choosing her and Colin over me.

01:27:30.145 --> 01:27:32.848
I wanted to get him back.

01:27:39.355 --> 01:27:41.857
I took her down
to the beach.

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:45.294
I knew she loved
the beach.

01:27:49.565 --> 01:27:52.768
My intention was
to drown her,

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:57.440
But she woke up and started
crying. I couldn't shut her up.

01:28:07.583 --> 01:28:12.855
She kept asking for her father
over and over again.

01:28:12.888 --> 01:28:16.024
No matter what I said to
calm her it was always,

01:28:17.426 --> 01:28:22.998
'I want my daddy, Uncle Tommy
I want my daddy.'

01:28:27.235 --> 01:28:29.472
Drove me insane.

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.875
"So I hit her."

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:41.584
You sat there every day saying
how much you loved Georgia

01:28:41.617 --> 01:28:43.118
And our family.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:45.588
I can't believe such
lies came out of your mouth.

01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:48.156
So that's what we're going
to start with first.

01:28:51.560 --> 01:28:53.862
What are you
going to do?

01:28:53.896 --> 01:28:55.798
Before I couldn't
hear you scream,

01:28:55.831 --> 01:28:58.601
Now I can hear every
noise you make.

01:30:36.031 --> 01:30:38.767
That's for all the bullshit
you dribbled to me,

01:30:38.801 --> 01:30:42.838
My daughter, and
my family.

01:30:52.781 --> 01:30:55.551
I think it's time
this has to go.

01:30:55.584 --> 01:30:57.520
You took my daughter's
right hand...

01:30:57.553 --> 01:30:58.887
An eye for an eye.

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:06.562
No! No! Please Derek,
I'm sorry!

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:11.867
[Angle grinder
being turned on]

01:31:12.635 --> 01:31:16.238
[Tommy screaming]

[Flesh and bone
grinding]

01:32:43.158 --> 01:32:45.327
Hey mate.

01:32:49.131 --> 01:32:52.067
- I got him, mate.
- Got who?

01:33:04.112 --> 01:33:06.715
Holy shit, Derek,
what have you done?

01:33:06.749 --> 01:33:09.217
Tommy, Tommy can
you hear me?

01:33:09.251 --> 01:33:11.086
What the fuck
happened here?

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:13.121
We need to call
an ambulance.

01:33:13.155 --> 01:33:16.224
Forget him col,
he's dying now.

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:17.960
This fucker got
what he deserved.

01:33:17.993 --> 01:33:19.327
Are you insane?

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:22.130
We need to get help now,
and if you don't, I will.

01:33:22.164 --> 01:33:23.365
Fuck!

01:33:23.398 --> 01:33:27.269
This fucker killed Georgia. He
deserves everything he gets.

01:33:27.302 --> 01:33:29.271
And if you continue to annoy me
I'll cut your fucking head off.

01:33:29.304 --> 01:33:30.405
You understand me?

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:33.441
I understand mate, he
deserves it, I didn't realize.

01:33:33.475 --> 01:33:37.946
Sorry please, please,
just let me go.

01:33:40.215 --> 01:33:45.587
Go on, get out.
Col...

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:48.023
Call mum and dad for me.

01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:56.231
Fuck, fuck...

01:34:01.236 --> 01:34:05.808
Harris, it's Colin.
Derek's got Tommy
and he's killing him.

01:34:05.841 --> 01:34:07.642
Slow down, slow down,
I don't understand.

01:34:07.676 --> 01:34:09.311
What do you mean,
"he's killing him?"

01:34:09.344 --> 01:34:10.813
He's got Tommy locked
in the pool room,

01:34:10.846 --> 01:34:12.881
My God, it's a
fucking mess down there.

01:34:12.915 --> 01:34:14.149
Okay, how do you know this?

01:34:14.182 --> 01:34:15.884
'Cause he tried to cut
my fucking head off!

01:34:15.918 --> 01:34:17.052
Are you still in
the house?

01:34:17.085 --> 01:34:18.987
No, he let me go.
He told me to leave.

01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:20.789
Good. Stay out the
front, on the street.

01:34:20.823 --> 01:34:23.926
Do not go back in the house,
we will be there in a minute.

01:34:33.635 --> 01:34:35.804
Time to
die, bro.

01:34:37.605 --> 01:34:40.208
Derek, please. Please.

01:34:56.591 --> 01:34:58.927
I gotta go. That's
detective Harris here now.

01:34:58.961 --> 01:35:00.528
I've got to go
speak to him.

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:02.697
I don't know whats
happened, Tanya.

01:35:02.731 --> 01:35:05.300
Just give your mum a call, and
I'll see you when you get here.

01:35:05.333 --> 01:35:05.934
Okay.

01:35:05.968 --> 01:35:07.335
See ya. Bye.

01:35:07.369 --> 01:35:09.004
Colin, are you okay?

01:35:09.037 --> 01:35:10.005
Have you got any
other injuries?

01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:11.373
Look, I'm fine, you
better get down there.

01:35:11.406 --> 01:35:12.574
Tommy's in a bad way.

01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:14.042
Derek thinks he
killed Georgia.

01:35:14.076 --> 01:35:16.745
Okay, calm down. Listen
to me, is he armed?

01:35:16.779 --> 01:35:17.479
Armed?

01:35:17.512 --> 01:35:18.480
Does he have a weapon?

01:35:18.513 --> 01:35:19.948
Ah, he's got a knife.

01:35:19.982 --> 01:35:21.349
Okay, is Tommy
still alive?

01:35:21.383 --> 01:35:22.785
Look, put it this way, if you
don't get down there now,

01:35:22.818 --> 01:35:23.752
He's gonna kill him.

01:35:23.786 --> 01:35:26.254
Alright, you stay with
detective Johnson.

01:35:26.288 --> 01:35:27.155
Sit in the car.

01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:28.556
I need you to
sit in the car.

01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:30.392
Hold that on your neck
and calm down.

01:35:30.425 --> 01:35:32.995
Sam, call for back-up and make
sure they're on their way.

01:35:33.028 --> 01:35:34.329
I'm going in to
talk to Derek.

01:35:34.362 --> 01:35:39.802
Derek, don't leave me
like this, just kill me.

01:35:41.369 --> 01:35:43.105
Derek!

01:35:43.138 --> 01:35:46.341
Don't do anything stupid,
mate! I'm coming down!

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:48.743
Stay there.

01:35:48.777 --> 01:35:51.479
I mean it.
Stay where you are.

01:35:51.513 --> 01:35:54.482
[Crying]

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:07.162
Go!

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.036
Clear!

01:36:16.404 --> 01:36:17.806
Go!

01:36:42.064 --> 01:36:46.401
No, Tommy, I'll do my
time for torturing you,

01:36:46.434 --> 01:36:49.604
But you will always be the
murderer in this family.

01:37:01.549 --> 01:37:05.020
Oy Tommy, don't die mate,
help's on the way.

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:08.556
Jail's next for you.
They'll love you in there.

01:37:13.228 --> 01:37:15.263
Don't!

01:37:15.297 --> 01:37:17.499
It's over.

01:37:19.801 --> 01:37:21.736
Clear!

01:37:22.570 --> 01:37:23.906
I know mate.

01:37:23.939 --> 01:37:25.908
Go!

01:37:29.111 --> 01:37:30.845
Clear!

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.149
Covering!

01:37:37.085 --> 01:37:39.454
The victim's downstairs.

01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:45.260
Georgia: Uncle
Tommy's down there.

01:37:45.293 --> 01:37:46.962
Clear!

01:38:48.423 --> 01:38:51.426
I love you, daddy.

01:38:51.459 --> 01:38:54.429
To the moon and back, baby.
To the moon and back.
