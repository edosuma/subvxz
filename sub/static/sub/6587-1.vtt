03:38.752 --> 03:44.690
Mr. Ryan, have a seat, please.

03:44.692 --> 03:47.359
Sorry to call you at
such an ungodly hour,

03:47.361 --> 03:49.628
but I like to start early.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.496
The early bird gets the worm,

03:51.498 --> 03:52.998
you know how that goes.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.300
So, Mr. Ryan...

03:56.569 --> 03:58.403
Give me one minute.

03:58.405 --> 04:00.706
I'm going to make a call, okay?

04:00.708 --> 04:02.241
I'll be right with you.

04:02.243 --> 04:04.009

in the morning.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.607
I don't give a who it is.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.309
Leave me alone, Angie.

04:37.311 --> 04:39.845
Who the is calling
at 5:55 in the morning?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.347
Angie, go to sleep.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.283
Jimmy...

04:44.285 --> 04:47.886
Ah, voice-mail.
Let me try again.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.629
Jimmy! Get the phone!

04:57.631 --> 04:59.665
Angie, didn't I tell you
never to pinch me?

04:59.667 --> 05:01.033
I can't stand it.

05:01.035 --> 05:02.334
Who is it?

05:02.336 --> 05:04.469
Angie, I just picked
up the phone.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.904
How am I gonna know who it is?

05:05.906 --> 05:07.939
I want to know who it is.

05:07.941 --> 05:09.474
Let me find out,

05:09.476 --> 05:10.942
let me talk to the person.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.911
And then I will tell you.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.813
Hello?

05:14.815 --> 05:16.581
Mr. valenti, sorry to call you

05:16.583 --> 05:18.984

05:18.986 --> 05:21.386
It's Gerry Gaci from
the Burman Bank.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.021
Yes, Mr. Gaci?

05:23.023 --> 05:25.524
Did I wake you?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.326
No, no, I've been up for hours.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.428
I went jogging, I
played a round of golf

05:29.430 --> 05:30.929
and I'm getting a pedicure.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.332
It's 5:55, what do
you think I'm doing?

05:33.334 --> 05:35.600
Ha ha ha, Mr. valenti,

05:35.602 --> 05:37.636
of eight million
dollars coming in.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.838
I need you to verify
these funds.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.541
Can my cfo come down and
sign those papers?

05:42.543 --> 05:45.711
I'm sorry, sir, but we
need you, as president,

05:45.713 --> 05:49.014
to verify such a
large transaction.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.649
You can come in

05:50.651 --> 05:52.784
six or seven days.
What do you say?

05:52.786 --> 05:55.420
Okay, I'll come down Friday.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.422
Thank you very much.

05:57.424 --> 05:59.057
I look forward to
meeting with you.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.659
Thank you, bye.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.561
It's the bank.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.930
There's this transfer coming

06:04.932 --> 06:08.633
and they want me

06:29.556 --> 06:31.390
I betcha you're in
your underwear.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.091
Those ripped up boxer shorts.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.527
You got a camera
in my room, Jimmy?

06:35.529 --> 06:37.529
No, I don't got a
camera in your room.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.663
Listen, Benny...

06:38.665 --> 06:40.832
I want to go back
to bed so shut up

06:40.834 --> 06:42.768
and let me tell you
what I gotta tell you.

06:42.770 --> 06:44.770
The bank called me and
told me that there's a

06:44.772 --> 06:48.840
transfer for about eight
million coming through

06:48.842 --> 06:51.643
and they want me to
go down and sign.

06:51.645 --> 06:53.812
You want me to go in
and do that for you?

06:53.814 --> 06:55.480
No, they told me
I gotta go down

06:55.482 --> 06:58.049
'cause I'm the ceo. New rules.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.886
Yeah, that's the new
justice department stuff

07:00.888 --> 07:02.687
that's going on.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.123
Yeah. Do I got a problem?

07:05.125 --> 07:08.059
No? Everything's good?

07:08.061 --> 07:10.195
Everything's fine,
everything's good.

07:10.197 --> 07:12.197
Okay, go back to bed.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.698
Okay, yeah.

07:13.700 --> 07:16.034
I'm up, but whatever.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.803
Good night.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.571
Okay, good night.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.673
Morning, whatever it is. Bye.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.012
Alright, Mr. Ryan.

07:27.014 --> 07:30.182
This is nothing personal,
but as you're aware

07:30.184 --> 07:35.120
your loan with this
bank for your house

07:35.122 --> 07:38.457
is a demand loan which means

07:38.459 --> 07:42.060
we can demand
payment at any time.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.130
You're aware of this, right?

07:45.132 --> 07:48.066
Now you've always
made your payments,

07:48.068 --> 07:51.870
but you've also always
been delinquent.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.573
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryan.

07:54.575 --> 07:57.642
I don't have a choice but
I have to call your loan.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.812
You have seven days to
pay it or we have to

08:00.814 --> 08:04.716
realize on its security,
that's your house.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.519
- My house?
- Your house.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.120
What are you talking about?

08:09.122 --> 08:12.023
My house is where I live
with my family, sir.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.092
I understand that,
and you have complete

08:14.094 --> 08:16.127
empathy and
understanding from me.

08:16.129 --> 08:17.796
But I work for a bank,

08:17.798 --> 08:20.232
the bank is run by a board.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.133
All I can do is answer to them

08:22.135 --> 08:25.570
and they want their
payments on your house.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.173
If you don't pay, they
will take your house.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.674
It's as simple as that.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.810
It is not personal,
it is not me.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.979
It is my job to inform you.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.982
How can I not
take it personally?

08:36.984 --> 08:39.751
You're talking about
taking my home

08:39.753 --> 08:41.852
where I live with
my wife and kid!

08:41.855 --> 08:43.688
No, I am not taking your home.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.891
What I am doing is
informing you of the fact

08:45.893 --> 08:47.759
that if you don't
make your payments

08:47.761 --> 08:50.729
my bank will
repossess your home.

08:50.731 --> 08:53.832
It's just the way it is,
Mr. Ryan. I am sorry.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.205
Angie...

09:00.207 --> 09:01.706
Jimmy!

09:01.708 --> 09:03.074
What are you doing?

09:03.076 --> 09:04.776
Jimmy, why are you
wearing that?

09:04.778 --> 09:07.178
I picked a suit for you.
I love this suit on you.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.881
Maybe you should wear it
because I'm wearing this.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.050
I'm going to lunch, I'm
gonna be a few hours

09:12.052 --> 09:14.753
and I'm gonna take
the Mercedes, okay?

09:14.755 --> 09:16.221
No, honey, I want
you to stay here.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.590
Stay, we can hang out
like we used to.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.859
Come on, we'll go to lunch.

09:20.861 --> 09:20.859
Angie...

09:20.861 --> 09:24.062
We'll have a nice day,
we'll go shopping.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.131
Angie, I got some stuff
to do, okay, hon?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.866
What stuff do you gotta do?

09:27.868 --> 09:30.101
Angie, I'll be back in a
couple of hours, okay?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.736
Why don't you get some sleep?

09:31.738 --> 09:33.204
You woke me up early enough.

09:33.206 --> 09:34.940
You think I'm gonna
forget that pinch?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.308
You're not going to
kiss me goodbye?

09:36.310 --> 09:38.610
Stupid of me,
what am I thinkin'?

09:41.147 --> 09:43.281
See ya tonight. Okay?

09:43.283 --> 09:45.250
Ciao, Bella.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.661
Mickey...

09:56.663 --> 09:58.063
! Mickey!

09:58.065 --> 09:59.931
Mickey, the baby's been crying.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.033
Could you just get up?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.668
I got it.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.778
Sonny, baby. Daddy's coming.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.214
I'm coming, son.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.084
Hey, how are you, my son?

10:19.086 --> 10:22.187
Can you keep it down?!

10:24.724 --> 10:25.991
Mr. valenti.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.392
Good morning.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.760
Good morning, Richie.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.161
Nice to see you.

10:30.163 --> 10:31.830
The car's out front.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.632
I didn't have time to wash it.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.767
No big deal. We're good.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.906
Have a good day, buddy.

10:41.908 --> 10:43.341
You too.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.677
Thank you. See you tonight.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.753
'Morning, daddy.

10:54.755 --> 10:56.855
Atta boy.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.324
Hey, how does
mommy look at you?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.310
Hello?

11:19.312 --> 11:20.845
Hey.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.415
I'll be there in
about 15 minutes.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.717
A lot of traffic,
I'm cutting through.

11:25.719 --> 11:27.752
I'm coming down
along the water.

11:59.886 --> 12:03.088
Don't go nuts ordering
a bunch of stuff.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.290
I'm not going to eat
heavy for lunch.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.392
I'm taking Angie to
dinner at that new place.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.095
I don't want to eat two
good meals in one day.

12:10.097 --> 12:13.364
Then I gotta run for a
week to lose one pound.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.401
Ha ha, I'm at that stage now.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.238
I'm almost there.
God bless you.

12:31.184 --> 12:32.050
Jimmy!

12:32.052 --> 12:33.218
Jimmy!

12:33.220 --> 12:36.054
Didn't I tell you
guys to order light?

12:46.800 --> 12:49.000
How you doing, buddy?

12:49.002 --> 12:52.971
Good. How much is a
hotdog and drink?

12:52.973 --> 12:54.372
That'll be four bucks.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.141
How much for just a hotdog?

12:56.143 --> 12:57.375
Three bucks.

12:57.377 --> 12:58.977
Gimme a hotdog.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.438
I know you!

13:27.440 --> 13:32.010
Mickey... Mickey Ryan.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.978
From Alfie's bar.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.526
Oh!

13:48.528 --> 13:50.295
Buddy, you okay?

13:50.297 --> 13:52.063
Come on.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.566
Look like you fell down,
you can't get up.

13:54.568 --> 13:56.401
What do you mean by that?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.236
Just what I said.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.138
I didn't mean anything by it.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.240
You okay, bud? You
look like you got the

14:02.242 --> 14:04.008
weight of the world
on your shoulders.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.543
I'm fine. Sorry about the-

14:05.545 --> 14:07.312
you sure you're gonna be okay?

14:07.314 --> 14:09.280
Anything I can do for you?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.082
Good luck, bud.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.287
Hey, you got room for one?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.489
I got room for no
less than one, baby.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.124
Have a good day.

14:30.604 --> 14:31.936
Good morning, Mr. valenti.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.338
Here are your messages.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.305
Thank you.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.907
Richie, what are
you doing here?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.508
I feel bad about
not getting your car

14:37.510 --> 14:39.210
cleaned up. Can I do it now?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.645
Come on, rich.
It's no big deal.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.547
Please, it'll just
take me a few minutes.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.482
Rich, I got a board
meeting upstairs.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.951
If it's not ready my
wife's gonna kill me.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.052
I understand.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.021
- You sure?
- I promise.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.055
Okay, buddy.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.590
So bring it down here, okay?

14:52.592 --> 14:53.625
For sure.

14:53.627 --> 14:55.026
Thanks.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.195
She's already called six times.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.597
Good morning, Mr. valenti.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.232
Good morning.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.500
Coffee, Mr. valenti?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.235
Uh, not really. You know what?

15:04.237 --> 15:06.504
I didn't sleep much last night.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.206
I'll have one of those -

15:08.208 --> 15:09.474
is that yours?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.075
No, I got it for you.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.377
Thanks.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.145
Benny's waiting in the
boardroom for you

15:14.147 --> 15:15.513
right now.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.049
I gotta make sure I'm out
of here in 30 minutes.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.918
My wife's already called
three million times.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.519
Talk about being obsessive.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.421
So I just want to
make it a quick thing.

15:23.423 --> 15:24.656
Is the agenda all ready?

15:24.658 --> 15:26.257
It's all ready for you.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.458
Jimmy, how are you?

15:27.460 --> 15:28.927
Good. Gentlemen, good morning.

15:28.929 --> 15:29.994
'Morning.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.329
So you got everything
on the bank?

15:31.331 --> 15:32.463
I do.

15:32.465 --> 15:33.932
Thanks Benny.

15:35.579 --> 15:36.068
Hang on.

15:36.069 --> 15:40.038
Let's sit down and we'll
get everything organized.

15:45.577 --> 15:48.079
Okay, so, explain to
me, if you don't mind,

15:48.081 --> 15:49.580
why we're going down there

15:49.582 --> 15:51.316
to verify this on Friday.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.583
Well, basically,

15:52.585 --> 15:54.218
a customer sends
us the money...

15:54.220 --> 15:56.021
They were supposed to
verify it with the bank,

15:56.022 --> 15:58.089
they didn't, and then we
should have verified it.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.091
So it kind of is our
mistake but since it's

16:00.093 --> 16:01.726
a transfer of a good
amount of money

16:01.728 --> 16:03.695
the bank shouldn't have
any problems with it.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.663
And I could go down there
with you if you'd like.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.731
No, I'm good.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.399
Everybody makes mistakes.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.668
Don't reprimand the
people in accounting,

16:10.670 --> 16:12.537
okay? It's not a big deal.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.372
And I should go
down there anyways.

16:14.374 --> 16:18.242
So this is standard
practice now?

16:18.244 --> 16:19.610
It's becoming.

16:19.612 --> 16:23.514
So then send a memo
to everybody, Benny.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.750
Alright, will do.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.086
And tell everybody that
it's standard practice

16:28.088 --> 16:30.555
that they need to detail
any foreign transfers

16:30.557 --> 16:32.757
of their account. Okay?

16:32.759 --> 16:34.092
Okay.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.693
What do you got for me, Dave?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.662
Top of the list is charitable.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.064
The new Brooklyn
hospital fundraiser.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.699
We can opt in at three levels:

16:41.701 --> 16:43.401
Silver, gold, and platinum

16:43.403 --> 16:45.770
at $50,000 or
$100,000 or $250,000.

16:45.772 --> 16:47.505
Understanding how you roll and-

16:47.507 --> 16:49.640
what's the money for?

16:49.642 --> 16:52.710
Like, is it going
straight to charity?

16:52.712 --> 16:57.181
'Cause you know when we
give money to charities

16:57.183 --> 17:01.119
we want to make sure
80% or 90% goes directly

17:01.121 --> 17:03.221
not to the administration,

17:03.223 --> 17:05.490
you know, I want it
to go to the charity.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.025
Already taken
care of that for you.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.726
Buddy, you do a great job.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.560
That's why you do that job.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.296
I just want to make sure.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.698
So what's this for?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.334
This is brand new care
units for the hospital.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.669
We have new equipment
coming in, um,

17:18.671 --> 17:21.105
all with your approval
from our meeting

17:21.107 --> 17:22.707
about six months ago.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.443
Okay, do it. Is
there anything else?

17:25.444 --> 17:27.211
No, understanding
how you roll, I know

17:27.213 --> 17:28.780
this is important
to you, I've already

17:28.782 --> 17:30.648
begun the paperwork
on the platinum level,

17:30.650 --> 17:32.316
with your permission of course.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.819
So get Benny to sign
off on it and that's it.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.454
Roger that.

17:41.460 --> 17:42.627
Excuse me, detectives?

17:42.629 --> 17:44.195
The chief would like to see you

17:44.197 --> 17:45.596
in his office immediately.

17:45.598 --> 17:47.565
He's been looking for
you for the past hour.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.800
Tell him we already left.

17:48.802 --> 17:50.368
Sorry, I can't do that.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.103
Yeah? You're a.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.204
Thank you, sir.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.806
- You.
- Thank you, sir.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.274
You're welcome.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.115
Chief, you wanted to see us?

18:04.117 --> 18:06.617
Oh, I'm glad I wasn't on fire.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.820
Where the hell were you guys?

18:08.822 --> 18:11.522
Sorry, chief.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.658
We were in finger printing.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.760
And having a quick coffee.

18:17.629 --> 18:18.763
That's splendid.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.298
Here's the bullet...

18:20.300 --> 18:22.133
The city is coming apart.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.335
I need to pull
you off vacation.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.170
I need another shift from you.

18:26.172 --> 18:28.873
Chief, you're looking at
the walking dead here.

18:28.875 --> 18:32.410
We worked 48 hours straight.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.245
You're not looking at tired,

18:34.247 --> 18:35.813
you're looking at exhausted.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.216
Yeah, we've gone straight
on the fox case, alright?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.851
Three straight
days, 20 hour days.

18:39.853 --> 18:41.385
We need a day off!

18:41.387 --> 18:43.421
You deserve a
day off, but look.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.490
The media's all over
me on the fox case,

18:45.492 --> 18:47.458
we got a convention
in town which means

18:47.460 --> 18:50.194
we got 50 Romanian pickpockets.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.130
We got a protest tomorrow...

18:52.132 --> 18:53.264
What protest?

18:53.266 --> 18:55.366
A protest, I don't know.

18:55.368 --> 18:57.835
Look, give me a
break on the shift

18:57.837 --> 18:59.871
I'll give you a vacation Vig.

18:59.873 --> 19:01.372
Oh, come on. You've
been saying that

19:01.374 --> 19:03.307
for 15 years, chief!

19:03.309 --> 19:05.543
You owe us about
ten years' vacation!

19:05.545 --> 19:07.745
Tony, you haven't been
here 15 years.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.813
Listen...

19:08.815 --> 19:11.282
You guys are the
cream in my milk.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.551
Don't leave me with
the morons, please?

19:13.553 --> 19:16.154
I know you got a union,
you could bust my balls

19:16.156 --> 19:18.489
but I'm talking to you
as a cop who came up

19:18.491 --> 19:20.458
through the ranks
just like you did.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.460
The city needs it, I need it.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.162
Can you help me out?

19:24.164 --> 19:25.496
I'm going home.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.298
I can't stand my own skin.

19:27.300 --> 19:30.501
I gotta take a shower,
I've got ass swamp.

19:30.503 --> 19:33.604
What's ass swamp?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.506
It's not good.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.675
Take a shower and come back.

19:37.677 --> 19:41.479
Go on, get outta here.

19:41.481 --> 19:44.282
Ass swamp...?

20:04.804 --> 20:07.271
- Did you call a cab?
- Yes.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.540
- Is this yours?
- Yes.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.518
I want to stay with you, daddy.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.588
Take a good look at
him 'cause that's the

20:23.590 --> 20:25.556
last time you're
gonna ever see him.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.425
You finally did it.
You lost everything

20:27.427 --> 20:29.694
and he will not grow up
to be a loser like you.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.329
Forget it!

21:25.785 --> 21:28.753
Mickey.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.321
Hey, Alfie.

21:30.323 --> 21:32.857
How are you, kid?

21:32.859 --> 21:34.759
I've had better days.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.594
Yeah, I know all about it.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.997
Listen, I'm gonna
set you up today.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.633
On me, alright?

21:47.706 --> 21:49.507
Go ahead, kid.

21:54.446 --> 21:57.348
You know what really
breaks my heart?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.550
Losing my kid.

21:59.552 --> 22:03.854
You'll get him back.
That kid loves you.

22:06.726 --> 22:09.660
What's he think of me?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.697
He'll think good of you
'cause he loves you.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.665
Don't you worry.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.901
How you doing?

22:16.903 --> 22:19.570
Heard about your situation.

22:19.572 --> 22:23.074
I got a funny joke for you.

22:23.076 --> 22:25.543
Two Jews walk into a bar...

22:25.545 --> 22:27.378
And they buy it.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.717
Pretty sad in this day and age

22:32.719 --> 22:36.854
they can get away
with things like that.

22:36.856 --> 22:39.523
Who said anything about Jews?

22:39.525 --> 22:46.364
You know, I miss a few
payments I lose my house.

22:46.366 --> 22:49.734
You think that's why you
lost your house?

22:49.736 --> 22:53.571
Huh? It wasn't Monday,
it wasn't Wednesday,

22:53.573 --> 22:55.106
but Jewsday.

22:55.108 --> 22:57.408
That's the day they
take things from you,

22:57.410 --> 22:58.642
you understand that?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.745
You lost your
house because those

23:00.747 --> 23:03.381
kike wanted to take your house

23:03.383 --> 23:04.815
and that's why
they have it now.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.784
Don't ever forget that.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.588
Listen, I just wanted to have

23:10.590 --> 23:13.124
a drink with my friend, okay?

23:13.126 --> 23:15.693
You want our help?

23:15.695 --> 23:19.830
We know how to handle
those lampshades.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.800
We know how to
handle 'em real good.

23:31.443 --> 23:34.745
Don't get involved with
those whackjobs.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.181
It's a really bad idea.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.058
B-59.

23:54.499 --> 23:55.933
0-71.

23:58.036 --> 23:59.837
Ah,.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.007
Can't even find the damn thing.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.642
Ladies...

24:04.644 --> 24:07.578
N-38.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.681
Ma, can I talk to you a second?

24:14.519 --> 24:17.488
Sweetie, there's no
breast milk here.

24:17.490 --> 24:21.659
It dried up a long time ago.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.594
Why do you talk like that?

24:23.596 --> 24:25.529
You're talking to her son.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.198
Oh, that's rude.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.699
What do you want?

24:28.701 --> 24:29.834
Ma...

24:29.836 --> 24:31.235
What? What?

24:31.237 --> 24:32.937
I really gotta talk to you.

24:32.939 --> 24:34.772
I'm about to win!

24:34.774 --> 24:38.776
Honey, we have a lot of
money invested in this,

24:38.778 --> 24:41.579
so could you come back later?

24:41.581 --> 24:43.080
Ma, it'll just take a minute.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.149
Just go outside with
me for a second.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.984
Can I have a cigarette?

24:46.986 --> 24:48.719
Thank you.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.821
Come outside, okay?

24:55.260 --> 24:56.660
Hurry back.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.596
Yeah, I will.

24:58.598 --> 25:01.131
Loser.

25:01.133 --> 25:06.270
She has to try to help her son.

25:06.272 --> 25:09.106
I had a son.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.275
He was a heroin addict

25:11.277 --> 25:14.011
and he couldn't help himself.

25:14.013 --> 25:16.614
And I tried every
way to help him.

25:16.616 --> 25:21.552
He tried too,
but he couldn't...

25:21.554 --> 25:24.522
He committed suicide...

25:28.761 --> 25:32.730
And I don't have him anymore.

25:32.732 --> 25:35.699
I can't help him anymore.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.268
But she can.

25:37.270 --> 25:40.237
She's a mother to this boy.

25:40.239 --> 25:42.773
She's got to help him.

25:42.775 --> 25:45.976
Don't let him go
the way my son went.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.655
Now what do you want? Hm?

25:57.657 --> 26:00.324
Ma, I'm in bad shape.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.159
I lost my kid.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.161
I gotta get my kid back, okay?

26:04.163 --> 26:06.230
I need some help.

26:06.232 --> 26:08.566
What do you want
me to do about it?

26:08.568 --> 26:09.867
I know all of this stuff,

26:09.869 --> 26:11.936
the whole town knows
all of this stuff.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.204
Ma, I'm trying to
get my kid back.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.106
I got nowhere else to go.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.242
You're the only one that I-

26:18.244 --> 26:20.010
you're all I got, ma.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.946
I just need a little help.

26:21.948 --> 26:24.748
Listen! You're the one that's

26:24.750 --> 26:27.051
supposed to be
taking care of me!

26:27.053 --> 26:28.218
I'm your mother!

26:28.220 --> 26:30.588
I gave you everything I had!

26:30.590 --> 26:32.656
I gave you everything
you and your-

26:32.658 --> 26:33.891
I do that, mom!

26:33.893 --> 26:35.225
I have been taking care of you,

26:35.227 --> 26:37.628
I've paid your rent, I
bought your furniture!

26:37.630 --> 26:40.598
I need a break
here! Help me out!

26:40.600 --> 26:42.266
I can't help you out!

26:42.268 --> 26:44.902
I got nothin' to give you.

26:44.904 --> 26:46.770
I mean, this is crazy!

26:46.772 --> 26:49.039
You should be taking
care of me all the time!

26:49.041 --> 26:52.109
I have nothing left.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.011
I got nothing.

26:54.013 --> 26:57.114
I lost my house, I lost
my wife, I lost my kid.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.716
I just need a break.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.284
Help me out a little bit.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.120
You and your brother
drive me crazy.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.723
You're just like your
father - no balls.

27:05.725 --> 27:08.158
So grow a pair! Okay?

27:23.308 --> 27:25.943
I-22.

27:25.945 --> 27:30.014

put my card in the atm?

27:30.016 --> 27:32.016
"Insufficient funds".

27:32.018 --> 27:34.385
Just call me
"insufficient funds".

27:34.387 --> 27:36.186
These kids now, I tell ya.

27:36.188 --> 27:38.288
You've got to help your son.

27:38.290 --> 27:41.058
You must help him,
he needs help.

27:41.060 --> 27:43.193
Don't let him go like that.

27:43.195 --> 27:46.263
I know what I'm talking about.

27:46.265 --> 27:50.801
I did that with my
son, and I lost him.

27:50.803 --> 27:53.437
My son committed suicide.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.406
Ohhh.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.714
Hey, Mickey.

28:03.716 --> 28:05.349
I brought you a blanket.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.852
You need some
pillows or something?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.454
No, I'm good. Thanks.

28:10.456 --> 28:11.955
Okay.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.757
It's great having you here.

28:13.759 --> 28:16.093
Great having you.

28:16.095 --> 28:18.328
Thanks Joe.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.431
It's gonna be okay.

28:20.433 --> 28:21.999
You stay here,

28:22.001 --> 28:24.068
we're gonna get Sean
back for you, okay?

28:24.070 --> 28:25.803
Everything's gonna be good.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.471
It'll be good, okay?

28:27.473 --> 28:28.939
Thanks man.

28:28.941 --> 28:30.908
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.142
In the morning.

28:32.144 --> 28:33.277
Okay.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.000
God bless you, Seanie.

28:57.002 --> 28:58.936
I'm coming to get you.

28:58.938 --> 29:02.139
Don't worry... Daddy loves you.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.405
Joe?

29:35.407 --> 29:36.940
Yeah, sweetie?

29:36.942 --> 29:38.776
Can I ask you something?

29:38.778 --> 29:40.277
Sure, what is it?

29:40.279 --> 29:45.783
When the did we
buy a hotel franchise?

29:45.785 --> 29:48.552
What are you talking
about, sweetie?

29:48.554 --> 29:50.554
Our living room is now like a

29:50.556 --> 29:54.858
super 8 motel
where your stinkin'

29:54.860 --> 29:57.961
of a brother is probably
jerking off on my couch.

29:57.963 --> 29:59.563
Shh, he'll hear you.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.466
Who gives a about
what he has to say?

30:02.468 --> 30:04.868
I want him out of here.
I can't stand the guy.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.303
He's a loser!

30:06.305 --> 30:08.906
Look, he put us up when
we didn't have any money.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.274
He put us up in his house,

30:10.276 --> 30:13.210
he bought groceries.
My mom didn't do that.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.045
I can't ask him to leave!

30:15.047 --> 30:16.580
Yes, you can ask him to leave.

30:16.582 --> 30:19.216
By tomorrow morning you
tell that loser

30:19.218 --> 30:20.918
to get the out.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.420
And you know what?
You know what I think?

30:23.422 --> 30:25.522
You can get out with him too.

30:27.959 --> 30:30.394
What are you looking at?

30:42.207 --> 30:45.209
Hey, Mickey. You're up early.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.010
Joey.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.546
Get dressed, I'll make
you a coffee, alright?

30:49.548 --> 30:52.850
Uh, Mickey, can I talk
to you for a second?

30:55.987 --> 30:57.254
What's up?

30:57.256 --> 31:00.224
Well, you know, the
house is small, right?

31:00.226 --> 31:03.126
You can't be comfortable
on the couch like that

31:03.128 --> 31:06.063
and, you know, I was thinking,

31:06.065 --> 31:10.133
and Julia was
thinking too, that...

31:10.135 --> 31:12.169
What are you saying, Joey?

31:12.171 --> 31:13.637
Well, you know...

31:13.639 --> 31:17.407
Wait a minute. I fed
you guys for two years.

31:17.409 --> 31:21.311
You stayed at my
house for two years.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.080
I didn't charge you anything.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.415
Nothing. What are you doing?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.517
I got some money for you.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.253
Are you throwing me out?

31:29.255 --> 31:32.289
One night I'm here and
you're throwing me out?

31:32.291 --> 31:34.191
Mickey, it's not like that.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.894
What, you're gonna pay me
off with a few bucks?

31:36.896 --> 31:39.496
What kind of brother
are you, Joe? Huh?

31:39.498 --> 31:41.164
Mick...

31:41.166 --> 31:42.666
What kind of brother are you?

31:42.668 --> 31:44.568
You're my only
brother and you're

31:44.570 --> 31:46.336
throwing me out on the street!

31:46.338 --> 31:48.272
You, you...

32:18.636 --> 32:20.570

32:33.485 --> 32:35.452

Let's go eat.

32:36.588 --> 32:36.586
Alright, we'll hit the deli.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.489
I want to stop by the
bank first, alright?

32:39.491 --> 32:39.489
Do that later, we're hungry.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.626

32:47.700 --> 32:50.300
Milkshakes, burgers, fries.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.652
Mickey...

33:08.654 --> 33:11.121
You don't look very good.

33:11.123 --> 33:14.524
My advice to you is
you go home and rest.

33:14.526 --> 33:18.762
Are you a psychiatrist, Alfie?

33:18.764 --> 33:21.064
Just gimme a drink.

33:25.336 --> 33:26.770
Serve yourself.

33:26.772 --> 33:29.673
Alf, I'm sorry.

33:29.675 --> 33:32.776
Just goes from bad to worse.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.089
He's having a bad day.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.661
You know...

34:24.663 --> 34:28.264
You could be one of us.

34:28.266 --> 34:33.370
If you cry, we cry.
If you die, we die.

34:37.507 --> 34:41.143
You're my brother
now. You're one of us.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.585
Do you know what it
is to put your life

34:49.588 --> 34:52.355
in the hands of a brother?

34:52.357 --> 34:54.357
Do you know what it means?

34:54.359 --> 34:56.659
I'll tell you what it means.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.329
It means that no other
mother kike Jew

34:59.331 --> 35:02.265
will ever, ever with you again.

35:02.267 --> 35:05.368
Ever, ever with you again!

35:51.683 --> 35:53.483
I have no other choice

35:53.485 --> 35:55.685
but I have to call your loan.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.255
You have seven days to pay it.

36:28.387 --> 36:30.887
I want to stay with you daddy.

36:30.889 --> 36:33.256

36:33.258 --> 36:35.692
to be a loser like
you. Forget it!

36:48.307 --> 36:50.373
You are the one
that's supposed to be

36:50.375 --> 36:52.576
taking care of me!
I'm your mother!

36:52.578 --> 36:55.545

38:08.420 --> 38:11.288

38:11.290 --> 38:14.057

38:14.059 --> 38:15.525

38:50.062 --> 38:52.562

Jimmy's gonna love it.

38:57.436 --> 38:59.336

41:04.829 --> 41:07.464
Nss breaking news,

41:07.466 --> 41:09.466
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:09.468 --> 41:11.835
disturbing, frightening
and tense situation

41:11.837 --> 41:13.903
developing right now.

41:13.905 --> 41:17.974
The Burman bank of
Brooklyn is under siege

41:17.976 --> 41:20.977
and unfortunately police
are not releasing details

41:20.979 --> 41:22.579
at all.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.147
Our news team is on the scene

41:24.149 --> 41:26.616
led by our lead
reporter Perry Lefko.

41:26.618 --> 41:29.185
This is a very
disturbing, frightening,

41:29.187 --> 41:32.622
tense, and quite frankly
a frightening situation

41:32.624 --> 41:34.657
is developing at this time.

41:34.659 --> 41:37.060
We'll hear from doctor
Georgina Cannon in a few

41:37.062 --> 41:40.530
moments to hear what
possesses people to do

41:40.532 --> 41:42.799
these types of horrific
acts that are happening

41:42.801 --> 41:45.535
right now at the Burman
bank of Brooklyn.

41:45.537 --> 41:49.005

41:53.678 --> 41:55.979
<i>Tony, I'm standing at</i>

42:33.118 --> 42:34.751
<i>So, you know, I'm Jewish</i>

42:34.753 --> 42:36.920
<i>and this thing</i>
<i>bothers me a lot.</i>

42:36.922 --> 42:38.988
<i>I've never seen</i>
<i>anything like this</i>

42:38.990 --> 42:40.890
<i>in all my years of</i>
<i>reporting, Tony.</i>

42:40.892 --> 42:42.625
<i>It is scary, it is frightening</i>

42:42.627 --> 42:44.561
<i>and it is personally sad.</i>

42:44.563 --> 42:47.597
<i>It's a sad statement on</i>
<i>the state of humanity.</i>

42:47.599 --> 42:49.933
We just arrived
live on location.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.101
We're not sure what
the problem is but the.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.337
Burman bank seems to
be totally under siege.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.272
We have no
confirmed reports yet

42:56.274 --> 42:58.107
but there were shots
fired, and we're

42:58.109 --> 43:00.043
not sure if anybody
has been injured

43:00.045 --> 43:02.045
but we'll keep our
eye on the situation.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.713
But it is just
total chaos here.

43:03.715 --> 43:05.114
As you can see behind me,

43:05.116 --> 43:06.983
SWAT teams and NYPD are here.

43:06.985 --> 43:09.018
I'm Gary gamble, Jewel radio.

43:26.637 --> 43:28.738
What kind of evil men are you?

43:28.740 --> 43:31.107
Shut the up, old man.

43:31.109 --> 43:34.077
You don't scare me.

43:34.079 --> 43:39.182
I've seen the devil,
and you are nothing.

43:55.899 --> 43:59.102
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

43:59.104 --> 44:00.903
Oh, yeah, old man?

44:06.744 --> 44:08.878
You hit like a girl.

44:08.880 --> 44:11.147
Stop. Please.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.281
Shut up!

44:12.283 --> 44:14.917
You want to see me
hit a girl, old man?

44:19.390 --> 44:23.092
Oh,.

44:25.363 --> 44:28.364
Now listen, this is ludicrous.

44:28.366 --> 44:32.035
You're letting a moron
hold us hostage.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.336
We have the power.

44:33.338 --> 44:35.738
You gonna go in there
and shoot everybody?

44:35.740 --> 44:38.207
I'm gonna take over here,
and if I take over

44:38.209 --> 44:42.145
we're gonna be gone and
home by supper time.

44:42.147 --> 44:43.680
Hey, Ralph...

44:43.682 --> 44:45.948
Ralph, come here.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.717
You got no business being here.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.752
I haven't called for
the SWAT team yet.

44:49.754 --> 44:52.088
I got certain business
here and I don't like a

44:52.090 --> 44:55.124
guy like that from
his rank telling me-

44:55.126 --> 44:57.794
this is my rank, which
is chief of police

44:57.796 --> 44:59.929
so stand down.

44:59.931 --> 45:02.098
I remember when
you became chief.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.700
Please, stand down.

45:03.702 --> 45:04.967
Thanks fellas.

45:04.969 --> 45:06.769
Jesus Christ.

45:06.771 --> 45:08.271
No, please..

45:08.273 --> 45:10.073
You a tough guy now?

45:14.044 --> 45:16.145
Hey, hey, hey.

45:17.281 --> 45:20.049
Stop! What are you guys doing?!

45:26.290 --> 45:27.757
Stop! Stop!

45:27.759 --> 45:29.292
What are you doing?

45:29.294 --> 45:30.460
Jesus!

45:30.462 --> 45:31.894
Come on, man.

45:31.896 --> 45:33.262
You're alright, get up.

45:33.264 --> 45:34.330
Hey.

45:34.332 --> 45:36.132
Jesus Christ.

45:36.134 --> 45:38.267
Hey, you're that guy...

45:38.269 --> 45:41.504
You're that guy who
helped me the other day

45:41.506 --> 45:43.873
when I fell.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.142
Yeah.

45:46.144 --> 45:47.810
Hey, you're not Jewish.

45:47.812 --> 45:50.279
What are you doing?
Get outta here.

45:50.281 --> 45:51.914
Go, get outta here.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.850
Come on. You don't belong here.

45:53.852 --> 45:55.451
I don't think I
can do that, man.

45:55.453 --> 45:57.253
It's nice of you, but...

45:57.255 --> 45:59.322
Tomorrow I'd wake
up with no balls.

45:59.324 --> 46:01.424
I'm gonna stick
around for the ride.

46:05.863 --> 46:07.430
Chill out, guys. Come on.

46:07.432 --> 46:09.165
Let me talk to
you for a minute.

46:09.167 --> 46:10.500
Come here.

46:10.502 --> 46:13.102
We're not here to do this!

46:13.104 --> 46:16.239
These guys gonna be okay
with those people?

46:20.277 --> 46:21.778
Welcome back to nss.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.780
I'm Tony Ambrogio joined now by.

46:23.782 --> 46:25.114
Dr. Georgina Cannon.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.250
We're all aware of
the horrific situation

46:27.252 --> 46:29.085
developing right now at the.

46:29.087 --> 46:30.853
Burman bank of Brooklyn.

46:30.855 --> 46:32.822
What, Dr. Cannon, is
going through the minds

46:32.824 --> 46:35.858
of the hostages and their
family outside the bank

46:35.860 --> 46:37.527
watching helplessly?

46:37.529 --> 46:39.929
Well, the hostages
are feeling terror

46:39.931 --> 46:42.865
because they're again
losing a sense of

46:42.867 --> 46:44.333
what they really know.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.135
They're in a bank,
they went there to

46:46.137 --> 46:48.404
I assume make deposits
or withdraw money

46:48.406 --> 46:50.139
or whatever they
went there for.

46:50.141 --> 46:51.908
And this happened like that,

46:51.910 --> 46:53.543
so they're in a place
of absolute terror

46:53.545 --> 46:55.211
and not being in control.

46:55.213 --> 46:57.180
When you lose control
of your environment

46:57.182 --> 46:59.582
all sorts of things can happen.

46:59.584 --> 47:01.584
So the person who's
holding them up

47:01.586 --> 47:03.219
is also feeling the same way

47:03.221 --> 47:05.354
but at a different
point of view.

47:05.356 --> 47:06.923
So they're terrified.

47:06.925 --> 47:08.357
And the families of course

47:08.359 --> 47:10.259
have no knowledge
of what's going on

47:10.261 --> 47:12.395
so they're worried
about their loved ones.

47:12.397 --> 47:14.831
They don't know if
they're alive or dead.

47:14.833 --> 47:16.499
They have no way of knowing.

47:16.501 --> 47:17.867
What's the 411?

47:17.869 --> 47:19.869
Somebody called in
from the main branch

47:19.871 --> 47:21.103
on his cell phone.

47:21.105 --> 47:22.505
- They called us?
- Yeah.

47:22.507 --> 47:24.040
We don't have a phone in there.

47:24.042 --> 47:25.408
No idea how many people.

47:25.410 --> 47:27.009
Do we have eyes in there?

47:27.011 --> 47:28.211
Not that I know of.

47:28.213 --> 47:30.112
We've got nothing.

47:30.114 --> 47:32.615
Trying to get some
information, but nothing.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.984
Hostages?

47:34.986 --> 47:36.552
Could be, probably.

47:36.554 --> 47:40.489
Get all the documents
over the last 30 days.

47:40.491 --> 47:42.491
I can't give you
all the details.

47:42.493 --> 47:44.527
I don't know whether
people are hurt

47:44.529 --> 47:46.596
but I know there's a hostage.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.397
Whoever did this has got some

47:48.399 --> 47:50.333
pissed off reason to do it.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.001
I know, but it's
at least 12 hours

47:52.003 --> 47:53.369
to get a warrant.

47:53.371 --> 47:55.238
We don't need a warrant.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.873
Ralph, you're not authorized

47:56.875 --> 47:58.407
to talk for the department.

47:58.409 --> 47:59.909
This is all off the record.

47:59.911 --> 48:01.410
Stand by with your troops.

48:01.412 --> 48:02.979
When we go in we'll call you.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.247
Thank you for being here.

48:04.249 --> 48:05.915
This is off the record, folks.

48:05.917 --> 48:07.216
You mention no control...

48:07.218 --> 48:10.219
The hostage taker is in
control and I ask that

48:10.221 --> 48:13.122
because as Perry told us
the scene outside there

48:13.124 --> 48:16.225
are a number of law
enforcement officials,

48:16.227 --> 48:18.527
a lot of people, a
lot of pandemonium.

48:18.529 --> 48:20.930
Are the hostage
takers feeling like

48:20.932 --> 48:22.465
they are in control?

48:22.467 --> 48:24.333
They may initially
but after a while

48:24.335 --> 48:26.402
they lose that,
which is why hostage

48:26.404 --> 48:29.338
negotiators are so
brilliant at what they do.

48:29.340 --> 48:31.173
Because they
understand the mind

48:31.175 --> 48:32.642
of the hostage taker.

48:32.644 --> 48:34.977
They understand that
that person started off

48:34.979 --> 48:37.380
being the strong one and
in control but realizing

48:37.382 --> 48:40.416
as the police gather
outside or whatever else

48:40.418 --> 48:42.585
is going on, there's
no way out so

48:42.587 --> 48:44.954
they have to negotiate
their way through.

48:44.956 --> 48:47.023
Chief, no warrants, okay?

48:47.025 --> 48:48.591
Yeah, I don't know,

48:48.593 --> 48:50.660
just don't let
anybody get hurt.

48:50.662 --> 48:52.261
Thank you very much.

48:52.263 --> 48:53.362
What?

48:53.364 --> 48:54.931
The mayor.

48:58.135 --> 49:00.336
Can somebody tell me
what's happening?

49:00.338 --> 49:02.371
Well, we will
when we know, sir.

49:02.373 --> 49:04.440
We know it's a
hostage situation,

49:04.442 --> 49:06.575
we don't know
exactly what's up yet.

49:06.577 --> 49:09.245
We just got here and
you might want to wait

49:09.247 --> 49:11.681
in your car until we can
break some news to you

49:11.683 --> 49:13.549
rather than standing around

49:13.551 --> 49:15.217
with nothing to do.

49:15.219 --> 49:16.652
You might want
to go to a school

49:16.654 --> 49:18.654
and teach the third graders-

49:18.656 --> 49:20.389
you could be fired on the spot!

49:20.391 --> 49:21.624
No, I'm sorry.

49:21.626 --> 49:23.659
You can fire me but
you can't fire him.

49:23.661 --> 49:25.728
I'll brief you as soon
as we know something.

49:25.730 --> 49:30.166
We got a call came
in a half hour ago from

49:30.168 --> 49:32.435
someone using their
cell phone in the bank.

49:32.437 --> 49:34.637
They said there's three
of them in there,

49:34.639 --> 49:37.473
they shot two security
guards. Okay?

49:37.475 --> 49:39.108
Thank you.

49:39.110 --> 49:41.377
They knew I was

49:41.379 --> 49:43.479
lying to them if you knew that.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.114
What the are you doing?

49:45.116 --> 49:46.549
Come on.

49:55.726 --> 49:58.027
Sit down, sit down.

50:00.397 --> 50:03.032
I never been shot before, man.

50:11.274 --> 50:12.575
Can you do me a favor?

50:12.577 --> 50:14.110
Absolutely.

50:14.112 --> 50:16.545
These guys, uh...

50:16.547 --> 50:18.647
Ah,.

50:20.550 --> 50:25.054
These guys always have
a bottle of scotch.

50:25.056 --> 50:28.758
Check out one of the drawers.

50:28.760 --> 50:31.060
Usually it's in the right side.

50:36.033 --> 50:38.134
How'd you know that?

50:38.136 --> 50:40.369
These guys live well.

50:40.371 --> 50:43.406
Johnny Walker blue label.

50:43.408 --> 50:45.508
God bless America.

50:52.649 --> 50:54.283
That's good.

51:09.132 --> 51:11.367
It's bad luck to
cheer with your-

51:11.369 --> 51:13.335
you're gonna have to push over-

51:13.337 --> 51:15.404
it's bad luck to cheer
with your left hand.

51:27.651 --> 51:31.654
Why are you doing this?
It's a suicide mission.

51:31.656 --> 51:33.556
Those guys are whackjobs.

51:33.558 --> 51:35.224
Why are you doing this?

51:35.226 --> 51:37.259
I'm so sorry, man. So sorry.

51:37.261 --> 51:39.195
You don't have
to be sorry to me.

51:39.197 --> 51:40.796
We all, uh...

51:40.798 --> 51:44.700
We all act a
little bit different.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.435
I'm gonna help you.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.237
I got money, I got scratch,

51:48.239 --> 51:49.738
I got a lot of friends.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.507
Let's get out of here.

51:51.509 --> 51:53.542
We'll just walk out of the bank

51:53.544 --> 51:55.644
and I give you my
word of honor...

51:55.646 --> 51:58.848
I give you my word of
honor I'm gonna help you.

51:58.850 --> 52:01.283
I don't give a.
Money's no object.

52:01.285 --> 52:03.385
I'll do my best to defend you.

52:03.387 --> 52:05.187
You haven't hurt anybody.

52:05.189 --> 52:08.324
If you stay here
you're gonna die.

52:08.326 --> 52:10.326
This is a suicide mission.

52:10.328 --> 52:12.795
There's a lot of
innocent people.

52:12.797 --> 52:14.897
So walk out with me.

52:19.469 --> 52:20.903
Our lead reporter Perry Lefko

52:20.905 --> 52:22.738
tells us that one of
the perpetrators,

52:22.740 --> 52:26.308
his name is Mickey Ryan,
he has no criminal past

52:26.310 --> 52:28.611
and is regarded as a good guy.

52:28.613 --> 52:29.612
Right.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.348
Why would a good guy crack?

52:32.350 --> 52:35.317
Well, again, it's lack
of inner resources.

52:35.319 --> 52:38.721
It is something that
is missing in him.

52:38.723 --> 52:40.689
So maybe when he was a kid

52:40.691 --> 52:44.260
he wasn't taught how
to handle trauma or

52:44.262 --> 52:47.596
issues that he didn't
particularly like.

52:47.598 --> 52:50.866
So what's happened is if
he's lost what he knows

52:50.868 --> 52:52.935
for sure, if he's
lost his footing,

52:52.937 --> 52:57.306
then he's going to want
to hurt or have a tantrum.

52:57.308 --> 52:59.575
This is an adult
tantrum, if you like.

52:59.577 --> 53:02.678
I'm not making light of
it but I think that's an

53:02.680 --> 53:04.813
easy way to explain
what's going on.

53:04.815 --> 53:06.882
When there's no inside
resources, when there's

53:06.884 --> 53:10.686
no strength inside you
just explode outward.

53:10.688 --> 53:12.955
I know, right?

53:12.957 --> 53:16.825
<i>Businessman and philanthropist.</i>

53:16.827 --> 53:19.595
<i>Jimmy valenti is</i>
<i>standing inside</i>

53:19.597 --> 53:21.497
<i>the Burman bank in Brooklyn.</i>

53:21.499 --> 53:23.566
<i>He has tried to save</i>
<i>a little girl's life.</i>

53:23.568 --> 53:25.768
<i>Usually when there's</i>

53:29.774 --> 53:31.607
What?

53:31.609 --> 53:33.609
<i>Police are being very</i>
<i>tight-lipped about</i>

53:33.611 --> 53:35.844
<i>the situation so there's</i>
<i>very little information</i>

53:35.846 --> 53:37.813
<i>to go on but it</i>
<i>seems at this point</i>

53:37.815 --> 53:39.815
<i>the police at least</i>
<i>have some control.</i>

53:39.817 --> 53:41.283
Oh, my god.

53:41.285 --> 53:43.519
Don't worry.

53:43.521 --> 53:45.854
Jimmy thinks he's
gotta save the world.

53:45.856 --> 53:47.823
He'll be okay.

53:47.825 --> 53:50.326
Don't tell me about my husband.

53:50.328 --> 53:52.394
You don't know
about my husband.

53:52.396 --> 53:53.896
I know my husband.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.497
I gotta go.

53:55.499 --> 53:57.233
Come on.

53:57.235 --> 53:58.968

54:33.871 --> 54:36.605
Aw, Mickey.

54:36.607 --> 54:39.508
I told you to go straight home.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.777
<i>..Who will tell us why</i>

54:45.316 --> 54:48.917
<i>Perry, who's there as</i>

54:48.919 --> 54:50.586
<i>Tony, it's not who's there.</i>

54:50.588 --> 54:51.987
<i>It's who's not there.</i>

54:51.989 --> 54:53.889
<i>Everybody who has</i>
<i>anything to do with</i>

54:53.891 --> 54:55.958
<i>law enforcement is here.</i>

54:55.960 --> 54:57.960
B-4.

54:57.962 --> 55:01.297
I didn't get it again.

55:01.299 --> 55:03.866
<i>Peter shay, Brian</i>
<i>canning and Mickey Ryan.</i>

55:03.868 --> 55:05.701
<i>They're all from New York.</i>

55:05.703 --> 55:07.770
Oh, my god.

55:07.772 --> 55:09.938
That loser son of
yours has got himself

55:09.940 --> 55:13.575
into more.

55:13.577 --> 55:15.377
You're a horror.

55:15.379 --> 55:17.646
You're really heartless,

55:17.648 --> 55:20.015
talking about
her son like that.

55:20.017 --> 55:22.851
Oh, poor baby.

55:22.853 --> 55:26.855
How did you get
yourself into this mess?

55:26.857 --> 55:28.891
Hey, look, you old hag...

55:28.893 --> 55:31.493
Up there, that's my son.

55:31.495 --> 55:34.630
If anyone is gonna be
disrespectful about him

55:34.632 --> 55:36.832
it's gonna be me. Okay?

55:36.834 --> 55:39.034
I'll tear your false teeth out.

55:39.036 --> 55:41.670
I will. I know how.

55:46.376 --> 55:49.578
Oh, my baby boy...

55:49.580 --> 55:52.014
What have I done?

55:57.754 --> 55:59.021
Joe!

55:59.023 --> 56:01.056
Joe, are you in the kitchen?

56:01.058 --> 56:02.758
Yeah, sweetie.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.827
I need some more vodka!

56:04.829 --> 56:07.696
You think you can
handle that, you moron?

56:07.698 --> 56:08.964
Coming!

56:08.966 --> 56:10.599
Hurry up!

56:10.601 --> 56:14.103
<i>Perry, do you know who</i>
<i>the perpetrators are?</i>

56:14.105 --> 56:15.804
<i>You gave us the names.</i>

56:15.806 --> 56:18.040
<i>But do you know who</i>
<i>these people are?</i>

56:18.042 --> 56:20.042
<i>All we know, Tony,</i>
<i>at this point...</i>

56:20.044 --> 56:21.477
Oh, my god.

56:21.479 --> 56:23.445
Your brother's robbing a bank.

56:27.118 --> 56:29.485
Hey! That's my vodka!

56:29.487 --> 56:30.986
I just bought that bottle!

56:30.988 --> 56:32.554
Pick it up!

56:32.556 --> 56:34.556
Shut the up!

56:34.558 --> 56:38.394
I sold my brother out for

56:38.396 --> 56:41.530
and you're nothing but a!

56:41.532 --> 56:45.934
<i>By three perpetrators.</i>

56:45.936 --> 56:49.671
<i>It is a very tense and</i>
<i>frightening situation.</i>

56:49.673 --> 56:52.474
<i>We will come back</i>
<i>after this break.</i>

56:57.614 --> 57:00.816
Mr. Ryan, I'm sorry to
bring you down here

57:00.818 --> 57:03.152
under such tragic circumstances

57:03.154 --> 57:06.121
but we're trying to
help your brother.

57:06.123 --> 57:08.524
We believe he's a good guy.

57:08.526 --> 57:10.058
He's a good guy,
he's a good guy.

57:10.060 --> 57:12.127
It's just bad circumstances.

57:12.129 --> 57:14.430
These are the circumstances

57:14.432 --> 57:16.598
I'm interested in
finding out about.

57:16.600 --> 57:19.835
The family let him
down, I let him down.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.870
How did you let him down?

57:21.872 --> 57:23.806
I just... I...

57:23.808 --> 57:25.441
My wife.

57:25.443 --> 57:27.142
My wife wanted him
out of the house

57:27.144 --> 57:30.045
and I let her do it.
I shouldn't have.

57:30.047 --> 57:32.815
I mean, he's done
so many good things

57:32.817 --> 57:34.149
for a lot of people.

57:34.151 --> 57:36.718
He's done good things,
he's a good guy.

57:36.720 --> 57:37.986
I believe that.

57:37.988 --> 57:41.457
I just went along with
it and I told him to

57:41.459 --> 57:43.926
get out of the house and
I didn't want to do that.

57:43.928 --> 57:45.961
You threw him out of the house?

57:45.963 --> 57:47.763
I threw him out of the house.

57:47.765 --> 57:49.698
I threw him out
of the house, okay?

57:49.700 --> 57:51.834
He got mixed up
with some bad people

57:51.836 --> 57:54.503
because it's not him,
he's a good guy.

57:54.505 --> 57:56.171
He's never been in
any kind of trouble.

57:56.173 --> 57:57.739
He's never done anything.

57:57.741 --> 57:59.775
He's been a good
guy, a good father,

57:59.777 --> 58:02.044
a good husband.

58:02.046 --> 58:03.912
He's had some troubles.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.781
He lost some money.

58:05.783 --> 58:08.050
He lost his job,
he lost his house.

58:08.052 --> 58:10.252
Now he's gonna lose his family.

58:10.254 --> 58:11.954
You gotta help him.

58:11.956 --> 58:13.555
He lost his house?

58:13.557 --> 58:17.826
Yeah. Yeah, he's
lost everything.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.495
He lost his house.

58:19.497 --> 58:21.663
He could lose his
life, I don't know

58:21.665 --> 58:23.265
what's going on
inside that bank.

58:23.267 --> 58:24.867
I need to get in there.

58:24.869 --> 58:26.969
I need to tell
him that he's okay.

58:26.971 --> 58:28.570
You said he lost his house.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.105
Is this the bank that
held the mortgage

58:30.107 --> 58:31.707
to his house?

58:31.709 --> 58:33.041
I think so.

58:33.043 --> 58:35.010
I don't know but I think it is.

58:35.012 --> 58:36.778
I think it's this bank.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.514
I don't know what happened.

58:38.516 --> 58:40.582
He had some kind of
loan and they wanted

58:40.584 --> 58:42.851
the money back and he
doesn't have the money.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.219
So they took the house.

58:44.221 --> 58:46.522
And now it's taken
everything away from him.

58:46.524 --> 58:47.890
His family, his kid.

58:47.892 --> 58:49.157
His wife left him?

58:49.159 --> 58:51.627
His wife left him,
told him he'd never

58:51.629 --> 58:53.262
see the kid again.

58:53.264 --> 58:55.097
What kind of woman does that?

58:55.099 --> 58:57.099
What does that do to a man?

58:57.101 --> 58:58.967
I don't know who
he's fallen in with

58:58.969 --> 59:00.903
but you gotta save him.

59:00.905 --> 59:02.671
I don't know what's happening.

59:02.673 --> 59:04.172
He may be dead in there.

59:04.174 --> 59:06.141
We're gonna save him,
we're gonna save him.

59:06.143 --> 59:07.943
We're doing the
best that we can.

59:07.945 --> 59:09.044
Please.

59:09.046 --> 59:10.679
Everything you
can tell us helps.

59:10.681 --> 59:12.047
I'll do whatever I can,

59:12.049 --> 59:13.782
just tell me what you need.

59:13.784 --> 59:15.017
What do you want?

59:15.019 --> 59:16.685
You're doing it right now.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.153
You've been a great help.

59:18.155 --> 59:19.988
You've been helping
us a great deal.

59:19.990 --> 59:22.324
But I gotta get back
to the scene, okay?

59:22.326 --> 59:24.560
Listen, no... Listen...

59:24.562 --> 59:27.262
Can I come with you?
Can I get in there?

59:27.264 --> 59:29.131
I can't do that.

59:29.133 --> 59:31.600
I'll get you in as
close as I can but

59:31.602 --> 59:34.136
you have to be behind
the police line.

59:34.138 --> 59:35.904
As close as I can get

59:35.906 --> 59:37.739
'cause I gotta
be there for him.

59:37.741 --> 59:39.741
I'll get you as close as I can.

59:39.743 --> 59:40.909
Thanks so much.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.277
You're welcome.

59:42.279 --> 59:43.879
Thank you, detective.

59:43.881 --> 59:46.114
Thank you, Dr. Cannon, so
very much for your time

59:46.116 --> 59:48.283
and for being with us on
such very short notice.

59:48.285 --> 59:50.852
This is a very tense
situation and, you know,

59:50.854 --> 59:53.021
humanity often
surprises me in a

59:53.023 --> 59:55.624
good way but sometimes humanity

59:55.626 --> 59:59.061
surprises us in a very
negative way as well.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:08.036
What's your name?

01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:11.173
Mickey... Mickey Ryan.

01:00:11.175 --> 01:00:13.041
Mickey Ryan.

01:00:13.043 --> 01:00:14.943
I'm Jimmy valenti.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.679
Good to meet you, Mickey.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.982
Mickey, I'm gonna
tell you something.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:21.917
I give you my word of honor,

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:23.785
we get the out of here

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:26.355
I'll get you the best
lawyer in the world.

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:28.724
And I'll look after you.

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.258
So trust me.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:33.729
Let's walk out, save
these peoples' lives,

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:37.866
and this'll be just
a bad dream.

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:40.168
Yeah, sure. We'll
walk out of here,

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:43.705
you'll go your way
and I'll go my way:

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:45.173
Straight to hell

01:00:45.175 --> 01:00:47.209
which is where I belong now.

01:00:47.211 --> 01:00:49.344
You're talking stupid.
Think about it.

01:00:49.346 --> 01:00:51.647
Mickey, think about it.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:53.782
You gave me a pass.

01:00:53.784 --> 01:00:55.384
I coulda left.

01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:58.020
So what am I
benefitting right now?

01:00:58.022 --> 01:00:59.855
I'm talking to you
from the heart.

01:00:59.857 --> 01:01:01.690
Not from the mouth,
from the heart,

01:01:01.692 --> 01:01:03.325
and I'm telling you...

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:07.029
You know what my
old man used to say?

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:10.666
It's nice to be great

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:13.435
but it's great to be nice.

01:01:13.437 --> 01:01:15.437
So I'm gonna be nice.

01:01:15.439 --> 01:01:18.974
Even though you
up a $700 shirt.

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:21.043
You and your boys.

01:01:21.045 --> 01:01:23.311
So before I bleed to death

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:26.848
let's get the
outta here, me and you.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.752
Okay, my friend? Let's do this.

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:33.889
Grab the gun and
let's go outside.

01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:37.693
We'll figure this out.

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:52.474
I'm good, I'm good. Let's go.

01:02:01.117 --> 01:02:03.051
Come on! It's about time!

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.754
Get the out here.

01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:07.789
I'm not doing this anymore.

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:09.925
I don't want to do this.

01:02:09.927 --> 01:02:12.260
I just want to go
home, alright?

01:02:12.262 --> 01:02:14.162
Let's just quit.

01:02:14.164 --> 01:02:15.997
What the are you talking about?

01:02:15.999 --> 01:02:17.299
You're one of us.

01:02:17.301 --> 01:02:19.201
No, I was never
one of you guys.

01:02:19.203 --> 01:02:21.236
I was never one of you guys.

01:02:21.238 --> 01:02:23.071
What the is
this guy talking about?

01:02:23.073 --> 01:02:24.906
Get on the ground all of you!

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.274
Now!

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:33.381
I'm so sorry!
I didn't wanna do this.

01:02:33.383 --> 01:02:35.951
I didn't mean this to happen.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:43.953
The hate, the anger...
Eclipsed my soul.

01:02:45.395 --> 01:02:48.263
I'm so sorry you people are-

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:49.831
it's my fault.

01:02:49.833 --> 01:02:51.433
I didn't want this to happen.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.934
Come on, guys.
Let's just go home.

01:02:52.936 --> 01:02:53.969
I want to go home.

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:54.836
Shut up!

01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.407
Freeze! NYPD!

01:03:18.428 --> 01:03:19.961
Don't worry, buddy.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:25.267
It's not real. It's
just a nightmare.

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.936
It's just a nightmare.

These two scumbags
took over the bank.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:09.010
A civilian took 'em out.

He took 'em out. He
saved us, he's a hero.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.848
We need an ambulance!

Make room for the stretcher.

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:36.071
That civilian saved me.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:37.939

I'm happy you're still

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:07.002
Don't you dare die on me.

01:05:07.004 --> 01:05:08.570
I'm not gonna

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:10.305

Give him back
his house, please.

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:29.257
I don't ever want to
be on the wrong side

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.526
of a pistol you're pointing.

01:05:36.032 --> 01:05:37.299
That's my husband.

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:39.000
Let me through!

You should have stayed
home, I told you.

Is he gonna be okay?

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.046
Yeah.

01:05:51.048 --> 01:05:52.681
Go with him.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:54.249
Alright.

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:12.600
Crazy kid.

01:06:19.542 --> 01:06:21.076
Mickey...

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:22.610
Mickey, I'm sorry.

01:06:22.612 --> 01:06:24.446
I'm gonna be a better brother.

01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.614
I'm gonna be a
better man, for you.

01:06:26.616 --> 01:06:28.149
For you.

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:41.463
Mickey... your mom
wanted to come

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.765
but she didn't have
the courage, honey.

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:46.701
I just want to tell you
she loves you and I'm so

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:49.337
sorry for how we treated
you the other day.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:52.407
We love you.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:54.609
Even I love you.

You're going to be fine.
