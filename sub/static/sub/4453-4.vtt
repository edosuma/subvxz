00:07.424 --> 00:08.508

00:38.831 --> 00:39.997
(woman): Whoa.

00:43.127 --> 00:44.836
Last stop.
End of the line.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.469
'Cept you, Sam.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.638
You owe me a drink.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.057
(piano playing)

01:01.270 --> 01:02.562
(piano stops)

01:23.125 --> 01:24.250
Two whiskeys.

01:26.253 --> 01:27.462
Plus whatever he's having.

01:31.842 --> 01:32.925
Bottle's right there.

01:34.303 --> 01:36.179
- Guess I don't feel much like pouring.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.310
- It's all right, we'll just, uh, head...
- I've got money, if that's the holdup.

01:43.604 --> 01:44.896
Show him the money, Sam.

01:50.986 --> 01:52.069
(grunts)

01:52.654 --> 01:54.614
- Methinks you best be on your way, miss.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.412
Assuming that's the appropriate way
to refer to you.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.294
- Tell you what.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.295
You don't want to sell me nothing,

02:11.256 --> 02:12.340
I'll bet you for it.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.010
I'll bet you a dollar...

02:16.762 --> 02:18.846
I can knock you out in one punch.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.598
(cackles)

02:23.268 --> 02:24.811
- All right. So...

02:24.937 --> 02:27.563
So the bet's on you knocking me to the floor.

02:27.689 --> 02:30.399
- Unless you don't want to muss
that pretty smile of yours.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.490
- All right, then.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.207
- One punch.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.125
One dollar.

02:48.544 --> 02:50.837
- And, uh, what happens
when I don't go down?

02:50.963 --> 02:53.923
- I imagine you boys
have thoughts on that already.

02:54.049 --> 02:56.175
- And what about the sprightly poodle
who's follow...

02:56.552 --> 02:57.969
(people exclaiming)

02:59.012 --> 03:00.179
(clattering)

03:04.726 --> 03:05.935
(coughs)

03:09.606 --> 03:10.690
(sighs)

03:15.529 --> 03:16.571
(groans softly)

03:35.591 --> 03:36.924
- Two whiskeys, you said?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.384
- Plus whatever he's having.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.346
- Stagecoach Mary, is it?

03:42.472 --> 03:44.849
- Proper name's Mary Fields.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.601
- Well,

03:47.352 --> 03:48.436
Miss Fields...

03:53.442 --> 03:54.567
Welcome to Laramie.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.073
(theme music playing)

04:31.104 --> 04:32.438
(groaning)

04:34.441 --> 04:36.609
(door opens)
- Open it up.

04:38.695 --> 04:39.946
You boys is leaving town.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.322
Leaving town where?

04:41.448 --> 04:42.698
- Anywhere but here. Come on.

04:46.870 --> 04:48.371
Ain't no time for that.
Let's go.

05:02.344 --> 05:03.386
Come on.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.017
- What're you Jakes looking at?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.228
- Shut your mouth, Matt,
for Christ sakes.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.331
- Up. Now.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
(horse nickering)

05:41.758 --> 05:42.758
(taps on carriage)

05:42.884 --> 05:43.926
Go!

05:46.430 --> 05:48.889
(speaking Cantonese)
Back.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.016
Hey!

05:50.851 --> 05:52.018
Back!

05:52.728 --> 05:54.603
Back. Back up!

06:02.779 --> 06:04.030
All right.
Let's load 'em up.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.282
Tunnel ain't gonna build itself.

06:07.868 --> 06:08.868
Tao?

06:11.204 --> 06:12.371
Mr. Tao.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.625
- You choose to let the murderers go free?

06:19.004 --> 06:20.129
- Law chose.

06:21.173 --> 06:22.298
Now, load up.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.806
(speaking Cantonese)

07:12.516 --> 07:14.308
- Uh... Let's go to work, John.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.562
I said, let's go to work!
(speaking Cantonese)

07:31.034 --> 07:33.744
I said get up on that damn train!

07:33.870 --> 07:36.038
(speaking Cantonese)

07:55.183 --> 07:56.350
- I said, load 'em up.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.153
Mr. Tao, get these men up on that train.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.626
No, uh-uh.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.629
No, that ain't the way.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.475
Guess you made your point
with your little speech right there.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.061
- I thought I made it
back in the railroad office.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.979
- Men don't work, they don't get paid,
and neither do you.

09:24.105 --> 09:27.149
- Those men just learned
that a white man can kill a Chinese man

09:27.275 --> 09:30.694
and all he'll get
is a free ride out of town.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.155
- I can't change the law.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.199
Get your people back to work.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.872
(exhales sharply)

09:45.126 --> 09:47.127
- After you address our list of demands.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.466
Enforcement of the agreed-upon
eight-hour workday.

09:54.177 --> 09:56.470
Your personal guarantee
to stop the beatings.

09:56.805 --> 10:01.100
Five dollar raise, per worker, per month.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.477
- You want them to get paid more,
stop skimming their wages.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.648
- The strength of your workforce derives from
the integrity of your workers, Mr. Bohannon.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.985
You must show them
the respect they deserve.

10:12.487 --> 10:14.154
- You mean, the respect you deserve?

10:14.489 --> 10:15.489
- Mmm.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.659
I have one other demand.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.538
A modest stake
in the Central Pacific Railroad.

10:22.664 --> 10:25.457
Say... Two percent.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.251
(snorts)

10:29.713 --> 10:30.713
- Yeah.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.590
No, I...

10:35.051 --> 10:37.636
I'll give you the workday
and curtail the beatings, but...

10:39.514 --> 10:40.889
No raise and no stake.

10:41.016 --> 10:42.641
Get the men back to work today.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.019
- My request for a stake is non-negotiable.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.980
- Sorry. Ain't on the list.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.774
- Men in America are compensated
based upon their value.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.527
Until you acknowledge mine,

10:54.696 --> 10:58.073
your railroad will not move another inch.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.788
(sighs)

11:32.692 --> 11:35.402
- Central Pacific's new route through Utah.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.822
They got their eyes on the coal fields,
Mr. Durant.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.368
Here, east of the Great Salt Lake.

11:42.494 --> 11:43.577
(chuckles)

11:43.703 --> 11:46.705
- Well, those California cretins
won't be through the Sierras

11:46.831 --> 11:48.791
by the time I reach Weber Canyon.
(scoffs)

11:49.709 --> 11:53.921
- Our progress on the C.P. has sped up
since Bohannon took over the work.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.047
(sighs)

11:55.173 --> 11:57.508
- That fustilarian backstabber!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.009
(sighs)

11:59.135 --> 12:01.345
You know, he lied to my face

12:01.888 --> 12:04.473
and before my back was turned,
he joined the enemy.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.933
I haven't forgotten that.

12:06.601 --> 12:08.602
I will grind him and Huntington to dust

12:08.728 --> 12:10.354
when I meet them
at the California border.

12:11.147 --> 12:12.231
- Yes, sir.

12:35.380 --> 12:36.463
(clears throat)

12:36.589 --> 12:37.589
- Good morning.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.967
- He's in a meeting.
(doorknob clatters)

12:40.552 --> 12:41.760
It's a private meeting.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.020
- Any chance he'll have
a comment for me today?

12:52.147 --> 12:53.272
- None whatsoever.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.567
- How's Abby?

12:58.528 --> 12:59.653
- Miserable.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.202
How's the life of a freelance writer?

13:07.328 --> 13:08.328
(scoffs)

13:08.788 --> 13:09.955
- Equally miserable.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.376
(sighs)
Look, Marty, I'm not asking

13:14.502 --> 13:17.212
for keys to the safe,
just who's on the other side of that door.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.509
- Surveyor.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.262
Came with a map case.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.023
- Does it bother you that the board chairman
of the Union Pacific is

13:36.608 --> 13:39.818
meeting with a surveyor
while his chief engineer has to wait outside?

13:39.944 --> 13:43.322
- The "chief engineer"
will not be disparaging

13:43.448 --> 13:46.492
the Union Pacific chairman
on the record for you today.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.164
- I can wait.

13:54.292 --> 13:55.292
- All right.

13:55.877 --> 13:56.877
- Well...

13:57.795 --> 13:58.795
(clears throat)

14:01.299 --> 14:03.759
Lovely to see you,
Miss Ellison, as always.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.304
Never speak to this woman.

14:09.641 --> 14:12.184
- I hear the railroad
has commissioned a new survey.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.561
Have you decided on a terminus?

14:16.314 --> 14:17.940
- You should stay out of the sun.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.566
You're starting to freckle.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.579
(bed creaking)
(grunting softly)

14:34.999 --> 14:37.793
- Get off him.
- She ain't going anywhere yet.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.711
- Customer's asking for her special.

14:39.837 --> 14:44.049
A rich one, too, not the usual mick trash
staining your sheets.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.217
- Let me off, Johnny.

14:47.053 --> 14:48.178
Oh.

14:48.513 --> 14:52.307
- You want to stick your prick in the
merchandise, you pay like every other mutt.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.436
Clean yourself up.
Customer's waiting.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.232
- Something's real sore down there.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.244
- Ah, Christ, Eva...

15:13.246 --> 15:14.830
- I want Shea out of my parlor house.

15:14.956 --> 15:15.914
(laughs)
- No.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.208
- The girls are complaining,
the customers are complaining,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.544
and he's costing us money.

15:20.878 --> 15:23.880
Another flush customer just came in,
looking for Josie,

15:24.215 --> 15:27.551
and I had to send him out
'cause Shea broke her money maker.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.012
- Aren't you supposed to fix
those kinds of lady troubles?

15:30.138 --> 15:32.639
- He also busted Ginny's door,
roughed up the professor.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.809
- You knew what you were getting into.
- And he stole three bottles of good liquor.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.019
And that was just this week.

15:37.145 --> 15:38.645
- He's my cousin, Eva.
- I want him gone.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.648
- He's there to keep the girls in line.
(scoffs)

15:41.774 --> 15:43.525
And by the by,
you've got bigger problems.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.528
Take's light for the second time this month.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.698
- You think new doors and lost business
don't cost something?

15:50.533 --> 15:53.035
You're lucky it ain't worse
with all Shea's mess.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.287
- He's my cousin.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.457
- Then you better get used to this.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.628
(door slams)

16:04.922 --> 16:06.089
(clamoring)

16:11.179 --> 16:13.263
(crowd cheering)

16:14.349 --> 16:15.432
- There you go!

16:15.767 --> 16:17.351
Get in there, Dutch!

16:18.019 --> 16:19.102
I've got a wager on ya!

16:19.937 --> 16:22.481
- Come on, help me break this up.
- No, sir.

16:22.607 --> 16:25.275
Got no taste for Irish beef.
(chuckling)

16:29.864 --> 16:30.947
- All right, everyone, cut it out!

16:31.282 --> 16:32.366
(yelling)

16:33.910 --> 16:35.202
Everyone back to work.

16:36.204 --> 16:37.788
(crowd): Oh!

16:42.293 --> 16:44.378
(gunshot)
(crowd gasps)

16:47.882 --> 16:53.595
- Fist fights and associated wagers
will be conducted on your time, not mine.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.263
- Oh, piss off, pork belly!

17:00.103 --> 17:03.063
- Pack up your shamrocks
and hobble your mick mouth off

17:03.189 --> 17:06.023
to whatever shit hole spawned you.
You're fired.

17:06.150 --> 17:07.858
(laughing)
You, too.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.612
- Mr. Durant, that ain't hardly fair...
- And we have a third!

17:13.491 --> 17:15.032
Do we want to try for four?

17:16.077 --> 17:20.079
Now, the only people I see
not flapping around like dim-witted ducks

17:20.205 --> 17:21.748
are the freedmen.

17:23.251 --> 17:25.794
Now, unless you want them
to take your jobs,

17:27.547 --> 17:30.173
I suggest you get back to work.

17:31.801 --> 17:32.926
Now!

17:34.220 --> 17:35.637
(foreman): All right, fellas, back to work.

17:44.522 --> 17:47.691
- I will not lose this race

17:48.317 --> 17:50.235
because you cannot be trusted

17:51.279 --> 17:54.030
to handle a bunch of Irish pissants.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.616
- They hit me in the mouth.

17:56.743 --> 17:57.743
(sighs)

17:58.745 --> 18:02.873
- The only thing worse
than a weak-backed leader...

18:04.500 --> 18:06.376
is a shit-brained engineer.

18:06.753 --> 18:10.672
Now, I want you back in the office
buried in bridge designs.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.884
At least you can't embarrass me there.

18:18.890 --> 18:19.014
- Just give Chang his stake
if that's all he's really after.

18:19.015 --> 18:22.100
- Just give Chang his stake
if that's all he's really after.

18:22.226 --> 18:23.393
By the time he cashes out,

18:23.519 --> 18:25.562
I'll have diluted his shares
so far underground

18:25.688 --> 18:27.439
he'll have to pick 'em up at Canton.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.274
- Still makes him an owner.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.943
- I saw a monkey once
dressed up as a doctor.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.320
Think he really was one?

18:34.280 --> 18:37.324
- I could settle this by noon
with a dozen men with axe handles.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.785
- Beat crew can't work
and we ain't got scabs.

18:39.911 --> 18:41.411
- Gentlemen, just get my railroad working.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.538
I don't care how you do it.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.210
- Find the incoming freight schedule.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.419
(door opens)

19:01.516 --> 19:04.142
Chang's asking for an ownership stake
in the railroad.

19:04.268 --> 19:06.645
He's prepared to let you sit here
until he gets it.

19:06.771 --> 19:07.896
He ain't gonna get it.

19:08.815 --> 19:11.107
Now, Huntington
won't approve the raise, but...

19:12.777 --> 19:14.694
I'll guarantee the rest of what you want.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.074
Help me convince the men
it's the best they're gonna get.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.335
- I cannot help you.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.005
- When this thing goes bad,
I wouldn't count on him.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.430
(chuckles softly)

19:45.685 --> 19:46.810
Have it your way.

20:03.494 --> 20:05.328
- Brother Rigby found him this morning.
(sighs)

20:07.415 --> 20:08.957
Rot spread through his leg.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.251
- Do the other saints know?

20:15.256 --> 20:16.423
- I wrote a sermon.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.887
I tried to, anyway.
- Good, good, good.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.266
- I want to hold the service tomorrow.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.938
- Yeah?
- I just need an opinion.

20:32.064 --> 20:34.482
- Well, of course, Brother.

20:34.609 --> 20:35.901
Yeah.
(mutters)

20:38.529 --> 20:39.613
(sniffles)

20:51.208 --> 20:52.417
(clears throat)

21:09.936 --> 21:11.603
- Brother.
- Yeah?

21:15.650 --> 21:18.109
Surely you can read your own hand.

21:19.654 --> 21:22.322
- Sometimes, I get the letters confused
when I look at them.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.533
- Mmm. Let me look, yeah?

21:31.791 --> 21:33.124
Phineas,

21:35.294 --> 21:38.755
have you tried memorizing your words?

21:38.881 --> 21:40.131
- Father said I'd never be able.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.008
At six years old,

21:44.220 --> 21:46.972
my, uh... my mother took me
to the House of the Lion,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.350
so I could read him the Good Book.
- Hmm.

21:50.476 --> 21:53.186
- It was the first time I was to read to him,
and I was...

21:54.855 --> 21:55.855
very nervous.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.733
I didn't get ten words out
before he stopped me.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.402
Made my mother take me away.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.321
It was two years before I even
saw him again.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.157
- Perhaps the trouble is

22:07.410 --> 22:12.497
you was not born to merely read the words
of our forefathers.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.083
Perhaps...

22:15.793 --> 22:17.335
perhaps you was born

22:18.212 --> 22:21.047
to speak from the heart.

22:23.718 --> 22:24.718
Mmm?

22:28.472 --> 22:29.472
Hmm.

22:30.808 --> 22:31.891
(Cullen): Hold it.

22:32.810 --> 22:33.810
Lock it up.

22:34.478 --> 22:36.187
- Mr. Bohannon,
I have paid for these goods.

22:36.731 --> 22:39.649
Surely you don't think you can...
- This train belongs to the Central Pacific.

22:39.775 --> 22:42.318
This depot is property
of the Central Pacific.

22:42.445 --> 22:45.447
This cargo is impounded
by the Central Pacific

22:46.032 --> 22:47.198
until further notice.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.286
I said, lock it up, son.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.622
(door closing)

22:56.292 --> 22:57.709
- You think you can starve us out?

22:58.335 --> 23:00.003
- Hmm, I think you're trespassing.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.718
- This is how you show us
the respect we ask for?

23:06.844 --> 23:09.095
- Nothing a man respects more
than an empty stomach.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.434
(steam releasing)

23:18.773 --> 23:20.857
- This won't get the men back to work.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.818
- Will if they want to eat.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.907
(speaking Cantonese)

23:33.788 --> 23:34.788
- Shake hands.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.209
Hey.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.593
- Last I saw,

23:49.178 --> 23:51.262
those two fools
were trying to kill each other.

23:51.972 --> 23:54.224
- Paddy's been spending time
with a whore Dutch fancies.

23:55.059 --> 23:56.559
They're due for a chat.
- Huh?

23:57.144 --> 24:00.396
You know these men backwards and forwards,
McGinnes.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.899
- Aye, sober and drunk.

24:08.197 --> 24:10.907
- How would you like a job
supervising them?

24:11.033 --> 24:13.326
- I'm not a railroad worker,
nor do I intend to be.

24:13.452 --> 24:18.623
- What, you wouldn't appreciate the security
of regular, government-backed wages?

24:19.083 --> 24:20.792
- If it's a loyal foreman you're looking for,

24:21.210 --> 24:23.795
to take care of your boys,
that's a service I can provide.

24:27.258 --> 24:28.466
For $20 a man.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.552
(laughing)

24:31.637 --> 24:34.264
- Three-Piece Duffy charged half that...

24:34.390 --> 24:35.598
- God rest his soul.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.184
Your railroad is slowing down
ever since Bohannon buggered off.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.311
- Bullshit. I'm making 5 miles a day.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.814
- Over flat prairie.
What happens when you hit the Rockies?

24:45.067 --> 24:46.109
I'll tell you what.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.445
I'll give you the first man,
starts tomorrow for 15.

24:49.947 --> 24:52.490
You like the results,
I'll bring in the rest for the full 20.

24:53.242 --> 24:54.284
- Ten for him.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.870
And fifteen for the rest.
- I'm not negotiating.

24:56.996 --> 25:00.373
I know you're flush and Johnny's got plenty
of other things he can do with his time.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.209
(sighs heavily)

25:12.595 --> 25:13.595
- Ow!

25:14.054 --> 25:15.054
(gasps)

25:15.723 --> 25:16.890
- Almost got it.
(groans)

25:17.766 --> 25:18.766
(exhales heavily)

25:19.268 --> 25:20.268
(groans)

25:21.145 --> 25:22.145
There.
(grunts)

25:23.689 --> 25:24.689
(scoffs)

25:25.399 --> 25:26.649
(chuckles)

25:27.234 --> 25:28.610
- He's been looking for that.

25:29.403 --> 25:30.737
- Keep Shea out of your room.

25:31.155 --> 25:32.238
He ain't your beau.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.616
- He ain't so bad once you get
to talkin' to him.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.451
- I don't care how he is.

25:36.577 --> 25:37.827
I want your clam working.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.246
(scoffs)
- My clam's been working well enough

25:40.372 --> 25:42.081
to pay for your silks and furs.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.252
- Mickey's take was light again.

25:46.921 --> 25:47.921
- Hmm.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.882
- I ain't in the mood, Josie.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.760
- Hey, I didn't steal anything!

25:53.886 --> 25:54.969
I swear.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.057
Eva, I don't have it.

26:05.898 --> 26:06.898
(giggles)

26:07.650 --> 26:08.650
I told you.

26:15.783 --> 26:16.950
Hey, quit it.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.576
Hey!

26:19.453 --> 26:20.453
(Josie grunts softly)

26:22.289 --> 26:23.581
- What's this? Huh?

26:24.625 --> 26:26.000
- I'm not stealing from you.

26:28.963 --> 26:31.256
- Don't mistake me for soft, Josie.

26:32.132 --> 26:33.132
Or stupid.

26:36.595 --> 26:38.554
- That's what we did,
me and Cyrus and the boys.

26:38.681 --> 26:39.973
We pooled our money together.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.684
Gonna own us a nice piece of land
here in Laramie.

26:43.519 --> 26:45.228
- Ain't no forty acres and a mule.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.521
- Nah, it ain't that now,

26:47.481 --> 26:49.774
but rumor got it,

26:50.609 --> 26:53.736
Laramie gonna be the new railroad hub.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.862
Yes, sir.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.282
Old Psalms ain't gonna be
digging grade forever.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.660
- I spent my whole life on the plantation.
- Mmm.

27:00.786 --> 27:04.289
- And I ain't never settling down again.
- Yeah.

27:05.541 --> 27:06.624
- Look here.

27:10.713 --> 27:13.381
Each one's got a story.

27:13.799 --> 27:15.258
- Mighty fine collection you got there.

27:15.384 --> 27:18.177
- This just what I came up here with.
You oughta see what's in the coach.

27:18.804 --> 27:19.804
- Hmm?

27:20.306 --> 27:21.556
You inviting me for a ride?

27:22.558 --> 27:24.017
- Well, now, there's a mouth.

27:24.143 --> 27:26.561
- Huh? Now you're talking about my mouth.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.146
And we only just met.

27:28.897 --> 27:30.315
- Shame on you, now.
- Mmm-hmm.

27:31.400 --> 27:35.945
Shame is to meet a woman beautiful as you
and not learn her name.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.739
- Her name's Mary Fields.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.533
- Miss Ellison, ain't you in the wrong place?

27:40.659 --> 27:42.994
- Louise Ellison,
I'm a journalist covering the railroad.

27:46.707 --> 27:49.584
I was just hoping to ask you
a few questions about

27:49.710 --> 27:51.252
the man you brought to town
this morning.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.630
He had a map case with him.
- We was in the middle of a conversation.

27:54.757 --> 27:57.675
- I'll tell you what you want to know,
you give me that pretty hair comb.

27:59.261 --> 28:00.345
How's that?

28:13.567 --> 28:15.526
The one with the case is Sam Ammerman.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.654
Brought him back and forth a few times.
- Back and forth from where?

28:18.781 --> 28:21.532
- California.
Where the other railroad at.

28:24.286 --> 28:27.163
- Mr. Ammerman brought a map case
from the Central Pacific?

28:30.209 --> 28:33.211
- You know, I like you better
with your hair down.

28:38.801 --> 28:39.926
(pounding on door)

28:40.386 --> 28:41.552
- Come in.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.309
Where you been?

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
- Busy.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.355
(sighs)

28:52.481 --> 28:54.399
- I'm not paying you
to wear that girl down, John.

28:55.109 --> 28:56.109
(chuckles softly)

28:57.069 --> 28:59.195
- Nothing'd wear her down.

29:00.489 --> 29:02.782
She's a good craic, that one.

29:05.828 --> 29:06.828
(sniffles)

29:07.496 --> 29:08.496
(sighs)

29:09.665 --> 29:11.290
- Tomorrow, you start a new job.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.293
Railroad foreman.

29:14.837 --> 29:17.130
(scoffs)
- Hell, I do.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.298
- Business is growing,
and I need you out there.

29:19.842 --> 29:22.009
- I came to this shitehole
to have some fun.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.888
Not rouse my ass
watching buggers pound spikes.

29:26.390 --> 29:27.890
You've plenty of money there.
Hire someone.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.351
- We don't want to hire someone.
- Do it yourself then.

29:30.477 --> 29:32.854
- Do you know which one of these piles
stocks the bar?

29:32.980 --> 29:34.147
Pays the bartenders?

29:34.273 --> 29:35.773
Runs the games, the whores?

29:37.401 --> 29:38.901
- Never been much for figures.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.236
- That's right.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.071
You've got other talents, John.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.783
And right now, I need you to employ them
out there on the railroad.

29:47.411 --> 29:48.786
Can you do that for me...

29:49.163 --> 29:50.288
while I handle this?

29:52.624 --> 29:53.624
- Sure, Michael.

29:54.501 --> 29:55.626
I can do that for you.

29:57.588 --> 29:58.588
- Good.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.099
- We done?

30:18.650 --> 30:19.650
- Here's some money.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.862
Would you ever go
and get that tooth fixed?

30:33.123 --> 30:34.123
(grunts)

30:34.791 --> 30:37.668
- What shitebrain started a fight yesterday?

30:38.128 --> 30:39.962
- We already settled things.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.514
(grunts)

31:04.238 --> 31:05.905
(panting)

31:06.573 --> 31:08.324
- My name is Johnny Shea,

31:09.743 --> 31:11.160
and I'm your new foreman.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.706
This is what happens
if you screw off on my watch.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.001
Now, back to work!

31:23.590 --> 31:25.174
- You heard him, fellas.
Let's go.

31:42.651 --> 31:43.651
(speaking Cantonese)

33:27.255 --> 33:29.840
- Mr. Chang is arming men
to come get the food.

33:35.722 --> 33:37.348
- It won't end well if he does.

33:38.892 --> 33:40.184
- There may be another way.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.355
I can show you.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.830
These men came to Gold Mountain to provide

34:01.915 --> 34:03.457
for their families in Guangdong.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.127
In China,

34:06.628 --> 34:10.255
it's a tradition for a man's family
to look after his grave.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.467
We provide our loved ones
with food, money...

34:14.636 --> 34:17.179
Everything he might need in the afterlife.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.224
But if there is no one to care for him,

34:21.643 --> 34:24.478
he wanders as a ngor gui.

34:25.647 --> 34:27.398
Hungry ghost... Forever.

34:30.777 --> 34:31.819
(mumbles)

34:32.362 --> 34:34.029
That's, uh, Yao Pak Na.

34:35.489 --> 34:37.783
He's got a wife and four children in Yunping.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.539
So, as long as he's here,
they will never be able to care for him.

34:45.876 --> 34:49.295
If living Chinese can't have
the same respect as white men,

34:52.424 --> 34:53.632
maybe the dead can.

35:07.189 --> 35:10.065
Honor the ones
who gave their lives for your road,

35:12.527 --> 35:14.320
I think they will go back to work.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.262
- Release my shipment,
there will be no bloodshed.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.223
- Come closer, Chang.
(cocks gun)

35:42.349 --> 35:43.516
I can't hear you.

35:55.111 --> 35:59.114
- The Chinese will not return to work
until our demands are met.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.542
(whistling loudly)

36:09.668 --> 36:10.668
(speaking Cantonese)

36:24.391 --> 36:25.599
(Cullen): It's all right.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.061
(unlocking door)

37:08.810 --> 37:10.603
Go and get your supplies, Mr. Chang.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.317
Now on...

37:16.902 --> 37:18.611
railroad carries the cost of freight

37:18.737 --> 37:21.363
to ship the Chinese bodies
back to their home villages in China.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.242
- Well, they come here
by the boatload for free,

37:25.368 --> 37:28.537
you expect me to pay
to ship their bodies home at cost?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.706
- It's cheaper than a million dollar raise,
ain't it?

37:36.379 --> 37:39.089
- Mr. Bohannon,
you'll make an executive yet.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.591
Gentlemen.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.221
(grunting)

38:00.236 --> 38:02.029
(Phineas): My fellow Saints,

38:03.531 --> 38:06.575
we're gathered under the eyes
of Heavenly Father

38:07.369 --> 38:09.161
to celebrate a life...

38:13.083 --> 38:15.709
And to mourn the death
of one of our own,

38:17.420 --> 38:22.299
tragically taken from us in the wilds
of California where we now reside.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.055
Brothers,

38:30.392 --> 38:32.059
we are far from home.

38:35.689 --> 38:39.274
Far from our friends and loved ones.

38:40.360 --> 38:42.277
Far from the families who raised us.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.533
Out here,

38:50.787 --> 38:53.706
we must build our own family,

38:58.753 --> 39:00.045
create a new home.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.967
We must watch out for each other
above all else.

39:08.596 --> 39:11.974
Otherwise we are living
in a world plagued by sin,

39:12.475 --> 39:13.600
by sorrow,

39:14.227 --> 39:16.979
waiting for far-off help
that may never come.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.315
- Come on, you dirty-minded hellers.

39:20.442 --> 39:22.067
Move your bones!

39:22.527 --> 39:25.904
- A world where we cannot trust
the men behind us.

39:41.921 --> 39:44.673
We must provide the boots for our feet.

39:46.176 --> 39:47.634
The clothes for our back.

39:50.013 --> 39:52.097
We must be our brother's keeper.

39:54.184 --> 39:57.644
We must take charge of our fate and fortune

40:00.273 --> 40:02.608
under the watchful eye
of Heavenly Father.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.638
(engine chugging)

40:41.689 --> 40:43.107
(horse neighing)

40:49.405 --> 40:50.405
(Mary): Ya!

41:22.814 --> 41:24.481
Get back inside.

41:25.305 --> 41:31.161
