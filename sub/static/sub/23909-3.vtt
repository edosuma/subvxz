penis to my daughter.

very expensive underwear.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.203
- It was stupid.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.406
- Nancy and I are suing you
for custody.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.474
- Eculizumab.
It improves renal function.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.843
It's also 10 grand a month
out of pocket.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.279

you can help me out with.

the baggie,

more uncomfortable.

rather shove--

- No, nuh-uh.
That's not gonna happen.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.694
- Oh, you'd rather just declare
a kilo at customs?

01:33.727 --> 01:35.329
- I don't wanna smuggle drugs
at all.

01:35.363 --> 01:36.664

supposed to do this?

- Well, I can't Friday.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.203
I have a home visit
for my custody case.

with the crying skull tattoo

01:44.405 --> 01:46.274
that Friday doesn't
work for you?

01:46.307 --> 01:48.442
- Fine, but we have to be back
in time for me to clean up

01:48.476 --> 01:50.344
and get all the drugs
out of my cavities.

01:50.378 --> 01:52.346

you guys.

okay?

01:54.482 --> 01:57.585

- Guns?

- Can't fit up your ass.

The mortgage.

We're going to default
again this month.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.751

you paid for it last month?

04:10.784 --> 04:12.620
- No, thank you.

together,

04:14.555 --> 04:16.357

do this tomorrow?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.769
- Nope.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.942
- I'm sorry.
I overreacted.

29:35.975 --> 29:39.378
She can come over for dinner.
Once, okay?

29:39.411 --> 29:40.512
- Nope.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.515
- What more do you
want from me?

29:46.953 --> 29:49.455
- Your hands where
I can see them.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.058
- [chuckles]
Seriously?

29:52.091 --> 29:53.826
- Oh, yeah.

29:53.860 --> 29:56.095
- Babe, I'm legit so tired.

29:56.128 --> 30:00.499
- Yeah, but you just came back
from a girls' trip.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.935
- Trust me,
it was not relaxing.

30:02.969 --> 30:04.503
- Oh, you could just lie there.

30:11.911 --> 30:14.413
- I was stupid.
- I know.

30:29.595 --> 30:31.130
- What does that even mean,
right?

30:31.163 --> 30:33.599
- Your daughter is one
impressive young lady.

30:33.632 --> 30:35.467
Okay, I just need
to take a quick peek

30:35.501 --> 30:38.337
in your mom's bedroom,
and then I am out of here.

30:38.370 --> 30:41.040
- No, wait.
- Sweetie!

30:41.073 --> 30:42.574
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

30:42.608 --> 30:43.976
- Nothing.
- Okay, that doesn't look

30:44.010 --> 30:45.611
like nothing.
- It's fine.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.013
- How long has this been
bleeding like this?

30:47.046 --> 30:49.115
- Since I made the shrimp.

30:49.148 --> 30:52.018
- Okay, how long did you
leave her alone today?

30:52.051 --> 30:53.920

30:53.953 --> 30:56.588
- We don't have any.
I already looked.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.925
- If this is a latchkey
situation,

30:58.958 --> 31:00.492
I'm gonna have to report it.

31:00.526 --> 31:02.995
- It's totally not.
- Honey, it's okay, Sadie.

31:03.029 --> 31:05.932
- She never leaves me alone.
- Sadie.

31:05.965 --> 31:09.501
Normally, I don't.
But today I had to.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.537
I had something really
important come up,

31:11.570 --> 31:13.539
and I--I just lost track
of the time.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.509
- Because of the mentally
disabled cancer kids?

31:17.543 --> 31:19.445
- Sadie, I have to take you
to a hospital.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.013
I... I think you need stitches.

31:21.047 --> 31:25.084
- Your car has the boot.
The boot.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.353
- Um...

31:27.386 --> 31:32.992
I'm kind of in between vehicles
at the moment.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.494
Any chance you could
give us a lift?

31:36.728 --> 31:39.098

Still doing intake.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.621
Which, of course,
I have to pay for.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.156
- What about insurance?

32:37.189 --> 32:39.491
- Oh, even with a claim,
we take a hit.

Sorry.

I would totally wanna
divorce my ass, too.

33:10.822 --> 33:13.225
But in the end,
I wouldn't.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.027
I would not.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.195
- Why not?

33:16.228 --> 33:18.064
- Why not?

33:18.097 --> 33:21.467
Because of the ancient
rule of two.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.635
- The ancient rule of two?
- Yes.

33:23.669 --> 33:27.073
Two houses, two mortgages,
two--two cable bills.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.307
- Okay.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.708
- Two water sewage
garbage fees?

33:29.741 --> 33:31.510
I mean, that--that--
that's craziness.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.045
- Wow, it is so romantic,

33:33.079 --> 33:35.214
the way you're wooing me
right now, honestly.

33:35.247 --> 33:36.648

33:36.682 --> 33:39.651
I'm begging you
not to leave me.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.520
- By way of sewage fees.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.090
- Well, I was gonna mention

33:44.123 --> 33:45.824
that you are the
love of my life.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.259
And that I wish everything
could go back

33:47.293 --> 33:48.760

how good I had it

33:54.733 --> 33:57.736
kind of cheesy,
so I decided to focus

33:57.769 --> 33:59.638
on the cable bill,

33:59.671 --> 34:02.108
which kind of isn't really
playing out

34:02.141 --> 34:04.042

34:06.678 --> 34:10.282
Look, I--I know you
hate me right now.

think we have
