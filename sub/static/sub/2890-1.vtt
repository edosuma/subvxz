02:22.184 --> 02:24.687
( distant woman speaking on radio )

02:32.444 --> 02:34.446
( birds chirping )

02:43.372 --> 02:45.374
- ( dishes clattering )
- ( breathes deeply )

02:48.586 --> 02:50.880
( car passes )

03:00.014 --> 03:02.016
( footsteps )

03:10.649 --> 03:12.651
( breathing heavily )

03:23.996 --> 03:25.122
- ( yells )
- ( gasps )

03:25.289 --> 03:27.291
( grunting )

03:34.757 --> 03:38.177
- ( screams )
- ( both grunting )

03:44.350 --> 03:47.311
- ( gunts )
- Ah! ( gurgling )

04:03.953 --> 04:05.955
- ( footsteps )
- ( sizzling )

04:08.707 --> 04:10.709
( pan clatters )

04:16.298 --> 04:18.300
( woman breathing heavily )

04:21.303 --> 04:23.305
- ( inhales deeply )
- ( gurgling )

04:25.975 --> 04:28.018
- ( grunting )
- ( clanging )

04:37.111 --> 04:39.113
( woman breathing heavily )

04:40.864 --> 04:43.575
- ( tires screeching )
- ( cars crashing )

04:43.742 --> 04:45.411
( honking )

04:45.577 --> 04:47.788
( car alarms blaring )

04:52.710 --> 04:54.712
- ( pan clatters )
- ( alarms continue )

05:01.760 --> 05:04.054
( tires screech )

05:04.221 --> 05:06.223
( car crashes )

05:06.390 --> 05:08.267
( speaking Spanish )
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

05:08.434 --> 05:10.436
( man breathing slowly )

05:12.271 --> 05:14.940
- ( tires screeching )
- ( cars crashing )

05:20.779 --> 05:22.781
I've been poisoning you
since last year.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.828
- ( tires screech )
- ( car crashes )

05:28.829 --> 05:31.540
You were supposed to die
in a few months,

05:31.707 --> 05:33.959
slowly, like up to now.

05:34.126 --> 05:36.545
- ( tires screech )
- ( car crashes )

05:36.712 --> 05:38.672
Nobody would realize it was me.

05:39.715 --> 05:41.675
Everything would have worked out.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.844
It would have been over with.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.471
( speaks weakly )
Why?

05:47.639 --> 05:51.143
Because I've been listening to the news
all morning and I've run out of time.

05:52.269 --> 05:55.272
( exhales )

05:55.439 --> 05:58.859
- ( tires screech )
- ( car crashes )

05:59.026 --> 06:00.944
( roaring approaching )

06:01.945 --> 06:03.864
( sighs )

06:07.409 --> 06:09.328
( sniffles )

06:09.495 --> 06:11.622
I'm sorry, it was going to be better.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.458
- ( tires screech )
- ( cars crashing )

06:18.003 --> 06:19.671
But we didn't have time.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.313
- ( woman laughing )
- ( man breathing heavily )

06:36.480 --> 06:37.940
( kissing )

06:38.107 --> 06:39.817
( girl speaks Spanish )
I can't sleep.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.655
( Speaking Spanish )
But it's almost--

06:44.822 --> 06:47.032
( sighs )
almost 8:00.

06:48.784 --> 06:52.246
Go to your room.
I'll be right with you.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.499
What do you want me to do?

06:56.542 --> 06:58.794
My parents lent me the house
with this condition only.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.506
( speaks )

07:02.673 --> 07:04.466
Well, let's do nothing.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.261
Man:
Xo, look...

07:08.470 --> 07:09.805
you have to sleep.

07:11.098 --> 07:14.935
Being a child is a bitch, I know,
but that's how things are.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.604
But in my house I don't have
to go to sleep until 10:00.

07:17.771 --> 07:21.066
Look, in this neighborhood,
children have to sleep early,

07:21.233 --> 07:22.943
because if not... err...

07:24.653 --> 07:26.613
- ( woman screams )
- ( snowman growls )

07:27.614 --> 07:30.993
- ...the Abominable Snowman comes!
- But it doesn't snow here.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.953
You tell him that
when he comes to get you.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.081
- Your uncle is all wrong.
- He is my cousin, not my uncle.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.667
Yes, baby, it doesn't
snow in Mexico City.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.419
Any idiot knows that.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.630
But many, many years ago

07:43.797 --> 07:46.467
there was a snowfall
that covered the city.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.095
It came from the distant
region of Nepal and sat here

07:50.262 --> 07:54.099
for 40 days in which the sun
barely came out to warm.

07:54.266 --> 07:57.478
It was snowing day after day.
People couldn't go outside

07:57.644 --> 08:01.064
and that's why they took so long
to realize what was happening.

08:01.231 --> 08:04.443
Many children were disappearing
from their homes.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.903
You know what happened to them?

08:07.362 --> 08:11.241
But your uncle does, right?

08:11.408 --> 08:13.535
They were found...

08:14.620 --> 08:17.414
- dead?
- Dead, of course.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.041
But that wasn't the worst part of it.

08:20.042 --> 08:22.044
Their hearts were torn out.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.173
After that, they realized
that whoever had done it

08:26.340 --> 08:28.425
only ate children's hearts.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.802
- When they finally found him...
- ( weapons clanging )

08:30.969 --> 08:33.679
...one of the bloodiest battles
in all of history took place.

08:34.681 --> 08:39.770
The battle was so long that in 1958
the government had to make a truce.

08:39.937 --> 08:43.232
Benito Juarez agreed with the snowman

08:43.398 --> 08:47.861
that he could live in a cold-storage
container with one condition--

08:48.028 --> 08:50.572
he could only go out at night

08:50.739 --> 08:54.618
and could only take the children
who were not lying down after 8:00.

08:54.785 --> 08:57.829
They don't have to be asleep,
but lying in their beds.

08:57.996 --> 09:00.874
Woman: But they have to demonstrate
good will if they are not asleep

09:01.041 --> 09:04.503
- and at least they must count sheep.
- And how is he?

09:04.670 --> 09:08.674
He rings a bell and has a cart
where he puts the children's bodies.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.384
And he screams!

09:10.551 --> 09:11.885
Sure.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.096
- He screams.
- Is he the Bogeyman?

09:15.597 --> 09:18.725
If you have to choose,
choose the Bogeyman.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.687
It's the kind of person
that will only abduct you.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.691
The Snowman from Mexico

09:25.857 --> 09:27.776
will take out your little heart

09:27.943 --> 09:30.946
and before you die,
you'll see him eat it.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.656
- Man #2: Gaaarbiishhhhhhh...
- ( gasps )

09:32.823 --> 09:34.950
- Did you hear that?
- ( bell ringing )

09:35.117 --> 09:37.202
- Gaaarbiishhhhhhh...
- Quick, Xochitl,

09:37.369 --> 09:40.622
close your eyes, close your eyes.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.708
Shhh.
Don't make a sound!

09:42.874 --> 09:44.793
( calling out )

09:49.298 --> 09:52.050
If you're going to do something,
do it right.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.930
She won't come out!

09:57.097 --> 09:58.890
( bell ringing )

09:59.057 --> 10:00.976
( breathing heavily )

10:04.688 --> 10:07.441
( moaning )

10:16.658 --> 10:18.619
( groans )

10:22.205 --> 10:24.082
Man:
Oh! The garbage collector...

10:24.249 --> 10:26.376
or my mom will kill me.

10:28.712 --> 10:32.132
Scare her with the garbage collector--
you're a bitch.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.302
Good night.

10:35.469 --> 10:38.639
( man and woman scream )

10:39.848 --> 10:43.060
( wheezing )

10:46.938 --> 10:48.315
( footsteps )

10:53.528 --> 10:57.199
- ( breathing heavily )
- ( girl muttering )

11:16.843 --> 11:21.682
Girl: 97 sheeps,
98 sheeps, 99 sheeps...

11:27.062 --> 11:30.565
One sheep,
two sheeps, three sheeps...

11:39.574 --> 11:42.494
( birds chirping )

11:42.661 --> 11:44.663
( water splattering )

11:55.465 --> 11:57.217
( woman speaks Spanish )
Bruce?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.052
Is everything okay?

12:03.640 --> 12:07.227
- ( crickets chirping )
- ( shuffling footsteps )

12:08.895 --> 12:10.689
( squeaks )

12:13.442 --> 12:14.735
( clicks )

12:18.739 --> 12:20.657
( whispering )
I heard a sound.

12:20.824 --> 12:23.410
- Huh?
- I heard a sound. Go see.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.899
- Woman: Bruce?
- ( birds chirping )

12:55.442 --> 12:57.319
Did you see this?

12:57.486 --> 12:59.446
( Whooshes )

13:06.661 --> 13:07.996
Bruce: Alice?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.308
Alice?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.564
( whooshes )

13:38.026 --> 13:40.237
( crickets chirping )

14:26.074 --> 14:28.827
( shuffling footsteps )

14:28.994 --> 14:31.371
( Alice mutters )

14:31.538 --> 14:34.207
- ( Alice whispers ) I heard a sound.
- Bruce: Huh?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.293
Alice:
I heard a sound. Go see.

14:50.807 --> 14:53.101
( birds chirping )

14:55.186 --> 14:56.313
Bruce: Alice?

15:04.571 --> 15:05.572
Alice?

15:07.574 --> 15:10.035
( whooshes )

15:30.013 --> 15:33.058
- ( both grunting )
- ( ghostly voices )

15:35.477 --> 15:37.646
( yells, choking )

15:37.812 --> 15:39.814
( grunting )

15:57.123 --> 15:59.084
( breathing heavily )

16:08.343 --> 16:11.179

16:19.020 --> 16:21.064
( whooshes )

16:28.947 --> 16:30.949
( water splattering )

16:32.283 --> 16:33.535
Alice: Bruce?

16:34.536 --> 16:35.996
Is everything okay?

16:47.132 --> 16:49.217
( thuds )

16:49.384 --> 16:52.137
- ( voices whispering )
- ( woman speaks, echoing )

16:59.060 --> 17:01.938
- ( rock music playing )
- ( mouthing )

17:20.498 --> 17:23.626
( woman speaks, echoing )

17:23.792 --> 17:26.003
( mouthing )

Buddy.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.578
( heart beating )

21:35.503 --> 21:38.339

23:56.978 --> 23:59.564
Ah! Ugh!

23:59.730 --> 24:02.316
Ah ah ah.

Ugh. Ugh.

- ( grunting )

25:06.005 --> 25:08.549
Woman on phone: This is because
I stuck my finger in you, isn't it?

25:08.716 --> 25:12.345
- Oh, come on, baby, don't be like that.
- Well, when are we gonna get together?

25:12.512 --> 25:14.889
- When are we gonna meet up?
- No no, tomorrow.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.724
It's just my ear.
It hurts a little bit.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.893
- ( high-pitched humming )
- ( chittering )

25:20.311 --> 25:22.355
( faucet runs )

25:40.540 --> 25:41.958
( splats )

25:42.124 --> 25:44.627

25:44.794 --> 25:46.462
I got you,
you little son--

Phew.

( high-pitched tone )

26:09.068 --> 26:10.903

- ( high-pitched tone )
- ( gasps, grunting )

26:31.132 --> 26:32.300
( splats )

26:34.468 --> 26:36.596
- ( bell peals)
- ( girl speaking Japanese ) Japan,

26:36.762 --> 26:40.641
we always believed,
was a country watched over by the gods.

26:40.808 --> 26:44.812
But me, I don't believe there is a God.

26:46.188 --> 26:48.858
Besides, if there really were a God...

26:52.028 --> 26:53.779
( grunts, farts )

26:53.946 --> 26:55.740
...sensitive girls wouldn't be

26:55.906 --> 26:59.160
- so ashamed whenever they had to fart.
- ( exhales deeply, sighs )

26:59.327 --> 27:02.330
Good morning.

27:02.496 --> 27:04.707
Aaah! Miss Yumi,

27:04.874 --> 27:07.335
were you watching?

27:10.254 --> 27:13.341
Oh no. I'm so embarrassed!

27:13.507 --> 27:15.176
I saw what you did!

27:15.343 --> 27:17.094
( laughs )

27:18.137 --> 27:21.390
( girl narrating )
Instead of God,

27:21.557 --> 27:25.102
I believe that Miss Yumi
is watching over me.

27:26.646 --> 27:30.566
When I'm with Miss Yumi,
I feel so happy,

27:30.733 --> 27:34.403
but I can't control the sense
of yearning swelling in my breast.

27:34.570 --> 27:39.075
- ( birds chirping )
- So gentle and pure--

27:39.241 --> 27:42.620
I wonder if Miss Yumi could
also make such a shameful noise?

27:45.456 --> 27:46.749
Just then,

27:46.916 --> 27:50.461
- we felt God's anger towards us.
- ( rumbling )

27:50.628 --> 27:52.004
- ( explosion )
- ( both scream )

27:52.171 --> 27:54.965
- Miss Yumi: Oh no! It's an earthquake!
- ( girls whimpering )

27:55.132 --> 27:57.176
( girl narrating )
The ground began to shake.

27:57.343 --> 28:00.054
- ( explosion )
- ( hissing )

28:00.221 --> 28:01.305
( gasps )

28:01.472 --> 28:04.225
- Gas! Gas is coming!
- Run!

28:05.351 --> 28:08.270
( grl narrating )
Or maybe that black gas...

28:08.437 --> 28:11.941
- ( girls gasp)
- ...is a fart from the ass of God?

28:12.108 --> 28:13.234
( coughs )

28:13.401 --> 28:15.861
( panting )

Don't.
I'm scared of bird flu.

58:19.872 --> 58:22.791
C'mon, traffic was bad
and I had this bird.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.169
Why buy it then?
Was it expensive?

58:25.336 --> 58:28.088
Don't tell me
you spent my money.

Uh, could you give me
one more of those?

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:46.243
Just like less high pitched
and more just like just terrified

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.703
and kind of make it a little bit
longer too, if you could.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:05.553
Did you see the press release?
I was last!

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.306
Yeah, I saw that.
You were even after Nacho Vigalondo.

( sighs )

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:12.936
Besides... five grand?
How do they expect us

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:15.105
to make any kind of movie
for $5,000?

01:11:15.272 --> 01:11:17.190
( sighs ) All right.
So what are we gonna do

01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:19.025
to make our segment stand out?

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.820
( snorts )

01:11:21.987 --> 01:11:25.782
What if our "ABCs of Death" short
is the only segment in the entire film

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:29.577
to feature an actual on-screen death,
like-- like somebody actually dies?

01:11:30.578 --> 01:11:33.415
Actually, that's a great idea.
Like we kill an animal or something?

01:11:33.581 --> 01:11:35.792
Yeah, it wouldn't have to be a person.
We could kill an animal.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:39.129
- Nobody gives a shit about animals.
- But what animal would we kill?

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:41.548
- It's gotta start with a Q...
- A "Q."

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:44.467
...or have something to do with a Q.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:46.469
Simon:
A fucking Q.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.187
( breathes heavily )

01:12:03.236 --> 01:12:05.280
Actually, he's kind of cute.

01:12:05.447 --> 01:12:08.325
- Yeah, he is.
- Here, Mr. Quackers, come here.

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.286
( clicks tongue )
Yes yes...

01:12:11.453 --> 01:12:14.247
- ( quacks )
- Ahhh, fuck!

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:16.458
Let's kill this fucking duck.

01:12:25.425 --> 01:12:27.969
Juan, you might wanna
back up just a little bit.

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.514
All right.

01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.482
Okay, so how do
we wanna do this?

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.525
We gotta make sure
we pretty much kill it right away.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:44.861
- We don't want it to suffer too much.
- Right right right.

01:12:45.028 --> 01:12:46.863
Yeah yeah.
This isn't a snuff film, this is art.

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:48.823
Ducks die all the time for food.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:51.785
Okay. Yeah yeah.
This is what you eat, America!

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:55.080
You American pigs!
They're the real killers, not us.

01:12:55.246 --> 01:12:57.665
That's right, yeah.
Hey, Juan,

01:12:57.832 --> 01:13:00.418
we're gonna just tail-slate this.
Is that cool?

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:01.961
All right...
so on the count of three?

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:04.130
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- All right.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.299
- One...

01:13:21.231 --> 01:13:22.941
thrrr--
hold on a second.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.069
Can you just shoot the duck?
I mean I--

01:13:26.236 --> 01:13:28.238
I know it's my, umm,
you know, thing,

01:13:28.405 --> 01:13:31.032
but, uhhh, if you would shoot
the duck, I'd appreciate it.

01:13:31.199 --> 01:13:33.701
Yeah yeah, I got it.

01:13:33.868 --> 01:13:36.746
Okay. One...

God damn it.

01:13:44.504 --> 01:13:46.423
- You got the safety on?
- I don't even know what side it's on.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.007
Yeah, it's that thing
the side right there.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:50.135

01:18:55.565 --> 01:18:57.483
( rattles )

01:19:01.237 --> 01:19:02.238
Ugh.

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.203
( panicked breathing )

01:19:20.339 --> 01:19:22.300

( creaking, bangs )

01:20:02.799 --> 01:20:04.801
( thunder rumbling )

01:20:10.890 --> 01:20:12.892
( rain pattering )

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:38.167
Let go of me,
you crazy-assed bitch!

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:40.837
( breathing heavily )

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:53.391
- ( clicks )
- What you're trying to do

01:20:53.558 --> 01:20:54.809
can't be done.

01:20:54.976 --> 01:20:58.187
Hell's coming down on you.
I'm just along for the ride, baby.

01:20:58.354 --> 01:21:00.523
- Want me to shoot you?
- You can't kill me.

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.025
( clicks )

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:04.193
- Lucky!
- ( laughs )

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:07.947
Yeah, woo-fucking-hoo,
it's my lucky day, you fucking psycho!

01:21:21.085 --> 01:21:22.920
Enjoy the ride, bitch!

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:25.673
Woman: Fuck you!
Motherfucker! ( banging )

01:21:39.353 --> 01:21:41.647
( distorted speech )

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:47.820
( engine starts, revving )

01:21:55.953 --> 01:22:00.333
( bangs ) You'll never outrun him,
you crazy junkie bitch!

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:01.959
- Shut up, bitch!
- Fuck you!

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:04.629

- ( bangs )
- ( tuning )

01:22:06.172 --> 01:22:10.301
Man's voice:
Close your eyes.

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:12.970
( rock music playing )

01:22:17.516 --> 01:22:18.601
( man #2 shouts )

01:22:20.102 --> 01:22:21.687
( tires screech )

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:23.898
( engines revving )

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.112
( man #2 vocalizing on radio )

01:22:41.082 --> 01:22:42.792
( engine sputters )

01:22:42.959 --> 01:22:45.294
( engine and radio stop )

01:22:49.674 --> 01:22:51.050
( mutters )
Fuck.

01:22:55.054 --> 01:22:56.263
( both grunt )

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:02.728
( man, deep voice )
For the first time in a long time

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:05.815
- I'm impressed.
- Good. Now leave me alone.

01:23:05.982 --> 01:23:09.026
Take her.
She's given up and you know it.

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:10.736
You cunt!

01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:15.324
Huh, naw... it's not her time!

01:23:15.491 --> 01:23:17.910
Please...
( sniffles )

01:23:18.077 --> 01:23:19.412
leave me alone.

01:23:20.705 --> 01:23:22.623
There's still so much I wanna do.

01:23:22.790 --> 01:23:25.001
Man:
You gave me a run for my money.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:29.005
Nobody's ever made me
chase them that hard before,

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:30.840
but you can't run forever.

01:23:56.574 --> 01:23:57.616
Fuck!

01:24:14.592 --> 01:24:16.635
( sizzles )

01:24:18.929 --> 01:24:20.014

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:35.029
- ( thunder crashing )
- ( footsteps squishing )

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.199
( rain pattering )

01:24:50.211 --> 01:24:52.630
- It's showtime!
- Woman: I can't understand

01:24:52.797 --> 01:24:54.340
why he's so afraid of the toilet.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:56.759
- ( clicks )
- For young boys the most common cause

01:24:56.926 --> 01:24:59.261
of genital injury is when
the toilet seat falls down.

01:24:59.428 --> 01:25:02.139
He's not gonna have that problem
if he's going for a poo.

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.974
Loads of people
have died on the toilet.

01:25:04.141 --> 01:25:05.935
- Like who?
- Elvis.

01:25:06.102 --> 01:25:07.978
- He died on the bathroom floor.
- Yeah.

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:09.939
Died on the toilet and then fell over.

01:25:10.106 --> 01:25:12.858
If I were him, I'd be more scared
of those screws I put in.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:16.028
- They're the wrong size.
- Honey, you go do a poo poo.

01:25:16.195 --> 01:25:17.863
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:20.866
Danny Glover had nothing to be
afraid of in "Lethal Weapon 2."

01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:22.576
- Shhh!
- We might even have

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:24.745
a lethal weapon
of his own in a moment.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:29.750
- Uh... ( screams )
- ( rumbling )

01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:31.961

01:25:32.128 --> 01:25:33.587
( gasps )

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:37.091
Father: Whoa!

01:25:37.258 --> 01:25:40.594
- Bleeding hellfire. That's odd.
- Shh shh.

01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:46.308
( boy screams, crying )

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:48.811
That's really odd.

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:52.940
( screws squeak, clink )

01:25:53.941 --> 01:25:55.025
Look at the state--

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:56.235
- Whoa!
- ( rumbling )

01:26:00.239 --> 01:26:01.949
What on earth?

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.869
( sloshing )

01:26:05.035 --> 01:26:06.662

01:26:06.829 --> 01:26:08.831
( roaring )

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:15.880
Call the plumber now.
It's an emergency.

01:26:17.131 --> 01:26:18.757
- Woman: What?
- ( roaring )

01:26:18.924 --> 01:26:20.092
- ( choking )
- ( woman gasps )

01:26:20.259 --> 01:26:21.385

- ( woman gasping )
- ( choking )

01:26:26.599 --> 01:26:28.934

01:26:33.022 --> 01:26:35.941

- ( gurgling )

01:26:36.108 --> 01:26:37.151
( whimpers )

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:40.112
( roars )

01:26:44.033 --> 01:26:46.911
( grunts, gags )

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.704
( squelching )

01:26:57.296 --> 01:26:59.506
( burps )

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:02.885
Huh?
( whimpers )

01:27:04.053 --> 01:27:07.640
- ( roars )
- ( screams )

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.350
- ( whimpers )
- ( crickets chirping )

01:27:09.516 --> 01:27:11.518
( gurgles )

01:27:15.856 --> 01:27:18.317
( distant barking )

01:27:18.484 --> 01:27:20.361
Hey! Hey! Wake up.

01:27:20.527 --> 01:27:24.907
He's finally using the toilet.
About fucking time.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:26.951
- ( light switch clicks )
- ( clicks )

01:27:27.117 --> 01:27:29.161

- He's spitting.

01:28:58.709 --> 01:29:00.544
He's spitting!

01:29:00.711 --> 01:29:02.671
( creature grunting )

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.757
Get in!

01:29:04.923 --> 01:29:07.634

- ( sizzling )

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:10.679
- ( snarling )

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.264

- ( breathing heavily )
- ( labored breathing )

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:26.839
I'll make you one promise--

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.800
your children will
never know how this ended.

01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:34.430

See?

01:31:01.290 --> 01:31:02.916
Father.

01:31:08.589 --> 01:31:10.215
Finish it!

01:31:10.382 --> 01:31:12.384
- ( speaking Latin )
- ( shrieking )

01:31:15.762 --> 01:31:17.181

- ( grunting )
- ( shrieking )

01:31:29.234 --> 01:31:30.611

Fuck!

01:33:08.417 --> 01:33:10.877
( baby fussing )

01:33:14.423 --> 01:33:17.092
The world is dying.
It's one of the reasons

01:33:17.259 --> 01:33:19.553
we implemented
the Infant Sterilization Act.

01:33:19.720 --> 01:33:23.432
Still, every citizen has the right
to earn back their fertility permits.

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:27.185
The fastest route has always been
through service to Propagation Control.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.979
Oh yes, sir, it's why I joined--

01:33:29.146 --> 01:33:32.649
that and making the world
a safer place, of course.

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:35.819
Of course.
Why do you want children?

01:33:38.488 --> 01:33:40.490
- Propagation Control.
- ( robot clanking )

01:33:40.657 --> 01:33:43.452
You are charged with acts of terror
through illegal propagation.

01:33:43.619 --> 01:33:45.829
You are hereby ordered
to surrender all contraband.

01:33:45.996 --> 01:33:48.665
Please, you don't know
what they'll do to him.

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.668
It's not up to me.

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:54.004
I'm sorry,
there's been a misunderstanding.

01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:57.966
You've already verified our permits.

01:33:58.133 --> 01:33:59.760
( thumping, squelching )

01:33:59.926 --> 01:34:02.054
- A misunderstanding.
- ( whirring )

01:34:02.220 --> 01:34:04.139
The illegals have escaped.

01:34:05.807 --> 01:34:07.517
We're free to go.

01:34:09.519 --> 01:34:10.687
Free to go.

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:17.986
- ( baby cries )
- ( chomps )

01:34:18.153 --> 01:34:20.072

( gasps )

01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:28.830
No!

01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:30.582
Bad, Nezbit, bad!

01:34:30.749 --> 01:34:32.959
Man:
Calm down, officer.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.712
Your Nezbit unit
simply auto-responded

01:34:35.879 --> 01:34:38.674
- to para-psychic activity.
- Commander Stoker.

01:34:39.758 --> 01:34:41.468
Stoker:
Congratulations,

01:34:41.635 --> 01:34:46.306
you've dispatched a rather dangerous
group of mentals.

01:34:46.473 --> 01:34:48.934
- Mentals?
- Telekinesis, telepathy,

01:34:49.101 --> 01:34:50.936
mind control-- all very real.

01:34:51.103 --> 01:34:53.939
- All valuable genetic materials.
- ( hums )

01:34:54.106 --> 01:34:56.191
- ( gags )
- ( gasps )

01:34:56.358 --> 01:34:58.110
( slurping )

01:34:59.778 --> 01:35:03.407
"Materials"?
We just killed a child.

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:06.410
Oh, it wasn't alive to begin with.
Not by law.

01:35:06.576 --> 01:35:09.913
Hmm. The rebels were delivering
the child to the Vatic--

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:13.041
"prophet" of all mentals.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.461
With such power, his very existence
threatens humanity,

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:18.922
but once we've reanimated

01:35:19.089 --> 01:35:21.633
and bio-vac'd every
last bit of brain matter,

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:24.219
we may finally ascertain his location.

01:35:25.679 --> 01:35:28.849
A fine achievement, officer.

01:35:29.015 --> 01:35:33.019
You see, the agency has
a far greater purpose than its...

01:35:33.186 --> 01:35:35.188
( sniffs, exhales )

01:35:35.355 --> 01:35:37.357
"public position."

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:43.196
You've given 10 years of service
to your unit, officer.

01:35:43.363 --> 01:35:45.031
Your records are excellent.

01:35:45.198 --> 01:35:47.492
I'm pleased to say that your permits
have been approved.

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:49.745
Sir.
( laughs )

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:52.205
- Yes sir, but--
- I'm not finished.

01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.045
While your permits are approved,

01:35:59.212 --> 01:36:02.257
there are biological factors
beyond the agency's control.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.346
Reanimate the infant.

01:36:14.019 --> 01:36:15.771
- ( inhales sharply )
- ( gun humming)

01:36:15.937 --> 01:36:17.731
I can't let you do this.

01:36:17.898 --> 01:36:21.651
Nezbit, Officer Lainey has clearly
been compromised.

01:36:21.818 --> 01:36:22.944
- ( Nezbit whirring )
- Arrest her.

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:24.738
I won't let you re-murder a child.

01:36:24.905 --> 01:36:27.449
Oh, grow up!

01:36:27.616 --> 01:36:29.117
( Nezbit whirs down )

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.620
( grunting )

01:36:31.787 --> 01:36:34.623
Stoker: Better a cruel truth
than a comfortable delusion.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:35.791
Sir!

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:40.295
Sir, the baby is--

01:36:40.462 --> 01:36:41.671
Where'd he go?

01:36:41.838 --> 01:36:43.590
( footsteps pattering )

01:36:48.303 --> 01:36:50.222
Sir? Did you hear that?

01:36:55.519 --> 01:36:57.813
( screams )

01:37:05.737 --> 01:37:08.281
It's a mental, idiot!
Shoot for the head!

01:37:11.243 --> 01:37:12.452
Oh shit.

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:26.091
( panting )

01:37:28.093 --> 01:37:30.262
Oh, such vitality... mmm!

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.806
I'll keep the corpse
alive for weeks.

01:37:33.807 --> 01:37:35.976
Wasn't taking him
to the prophet.

01:37:36.142 --> 01:37:38.478
Farm every burning neuron.

01:37:38.645 --> 01:37:40.564
He is the prophet.

01:37:43.066 --> 01:37:44.359
I'll feast on its pain.

01:37:44.526 --> 01:37:47.445
Mental:
Take him. Unite the mentals.

01:37:48.488 --> 01:37:50.448
- Oh!
- You're his mother now.

01:37:50.615 --> 01:37:53.326
- ( cries )
- ( grunts )

01:37:59.291 --> 01:38:01.084
- ( moaning )
- Scream, witch.

01:38:02.085 --> 01:38:03.545
No one will hear you

01:38:03.712 --> 01:38:06.298
- as I harvest your intestines.
- ( clanks )

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:09.301
- What?
- Unhand her, witch!

01:38:09.467 --> 01:38:11.177
- Willowford!
- Wendy!

01:38:11.344 --> 01:38:13.805
- Save me!
- Now, warlock!

01:38:13.972 --> 01:38:15.432
- ( groans )
- ( cries out )

01:38:15.599 --> 01:38:18.435
- ( crackling )
- ( screaming )

01:38:18.602 --> 01:38:21.187
( cackling )

01:38:25.525 --> 01:38:26.860
- What the fuck?
- What's up, Tommy?

01:38:27.027 --> 01:38:28.904
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Look, the thing's almost done.

01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:30.864
- What is that!?
- Well, um, it's for animated--

01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:33.074
it's the last frame of the animation
I've been working on, remember?

01:38:33.241 --> 01:38:34.326
- Animation?
- Yeah.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:36.202
We weren't even supposed
to have animation!

01:38:36.369 --> 01:38:38.747
Well, we talked about a bunch
of different ideas, remember?

01:38:38.914 --> 01:38:40.832
Look at this list of,
err, "W"s I got here.

01:38:40.999 --> 01:38:42.500
Oh my God, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:44.127
We're gonna get this done.
Hold on, it's a--

01:38:44.294 --> 01:38:45.962
- Why do you do this?
- Here's the thing-- walrus.

01:38:46.129 --> 01:38:48.298
It's like a Godzilla-walrus.

01:38:48.465 --> 01:38:51.635
It's a city-- people are being
destroyed, you pan over, it's a walrus.

01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:52.802
- Tommy: Okay?
- Man: "W."

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:54.679
- Okay, do you have a city?
- No.

01:38:54.846 --> 01:38:56.973
- Do you have a guy in a walrus outfit?
- No.

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.975
- Can you do that by this weekend?
- No.

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:01.561
( shouts ) Well, what the fuck
are you talking about then?

01:39:01.728 --> 01:39:03.897
- Man: Warrior.
- Man #2: Super hot chick.

01:39:04.064 --> 01:39:07.025
She's just killed a bunch
of, like... trolls?

01:39:07.192 --> 01:39:09.569
All right, whatever,
she's covered in blood.

01:39:09.736 --> 01:39:11.404
Okay. Let's do that.
Let's do that this weekend.

01:39:11.571 --> 01:39:13.949
I'm not sure I even want to do that one.
I'm just saying it's an idea.

01:39:14.115 --> 01:39:17.243
"W" is for wheelchair.
It's an old man-- an evil old man.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:19.537
He's in the wheelchair--
everybody hates old people.

01:39:19.704 --> 01:39:21.414
- He gets pushed off a fucking cliff.
- ( screams )

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:24.042
I got-- ummm...

01:39:24.209 --> 01:39:27.212
I got-- I got nothing.

01:39:27.379 --> 01:39:29.923
You guys! Come to the conference room.
Come on, you gotta see this!

01:39:30.090 --> 01:39:33.343
Man on TV: Nancy, I'm coming to you
from downtown Hollywood.

01:39:33.510 --> 01:39:35.261
I've got to tell you, some of
the strangest things I have ever seen...

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:36.805
- Oh fuck, what's going on?
- ...are going on right now.

01:39:36.972 --> 01:39:41.226
If you can see, over my head,
the most oddest looking colored gases.

01:39:41.393 --> 01:39:44.104
Uh, they're like chemtrails, I guess,
and they seem

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:48.400
to be followed by other planes
and copters, and a general sense of...

01:39:48.566 --> 01:39:50.527
- "W'!
- ...panic seems to have hit the area.

01:39:50.694 --> 01:39:52.404
Believe it or not, Nancy,
we're actually getting reports

01:39:52.570 --> 01:39:55.407
of people seeing
clown zombies in the streets.

01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:58.785
Fuckin' clown zombies?
That's fucking stupid!

01:39:58.952 --> 01:40:01.579
What, are they looking
for magnets? "W"? I just...

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:04.124
Is that a "W" on there?
What's up with these "W"s?

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:06.626
Man on TV: Is this some kind of
self-fulfilling prophecy,

01:40:06.793 --> 01:40:08.628
as we watch the horror

01:40:08.795 --> 01:40:10.130
of our own minds

01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:14.134
pushing humanity
toward extinction?

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:15.969
Can we live in a world

01:40:16.136 --> 01:40:18.972
that is more immoral
than our own brains,

01:40:19.139 --> 01:40:21.474
- our own ideas?
- No! Don't open the door!

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:23.893
We live in a process
that is already infested,

01:40:24.060 --> 01:40:26.062
already mutated, already over!

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:28.648
- Already blank-- already blank..
- ( screaming )

01:40:28.815 --> 01:40:31.693
...from a wave
of congealed confidence!

01:40:31.860 --> 01:40:35.655
( echoing )
My elbows are untouchable!

01:40:35.822 --> 01:40:37.532
My elbows are sharp!

01:40:37.699 --> 01:40:39.868
I am transparent.

01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:44.581
I am solid in the form
of this new liberty reborn!

01:40:44.748 --> 01:40:48.084
You-you-you are invisible
in this new world!

01:40:48.251 --> 01:40:50.837
I hover above you...

01:40:51.004 --> 01:40:54.299
above as below.

01:40:54.466 --> 01:40:56.384
I am legion.

01:40:56.551 --> 01:41:00.305
A traced mindfuck of a billion bombs

01:41:00.472 --> 01:41:03.391
dropping on your fired synapses,

01:41:03.558 --> 01:41:05.351
your tired synapses!

01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:07.812
You are inserted,

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:10.899
digested, gestated!

01:41:11.066 --> 01:41:15.320
Lie in the waste of your own vision,

01:41:15.487 --> 01:41:20.116
gutter punks to bigger words
that you ate years ago!

01:41:20.283 --> 01:41:23.912
That you tasted
and shat upon years ago!

01:41:24.079 --> 01:41:26.748
That you chewed and corrupted

01:41:26.915 --> 01:41:29.834
after the seeds were buried long ago!

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:34.047
I am the one with seven heads!

01:41:34.214 --> 01:41:37.842
I am the thing that laughs!

01:41:38.009 --> 01:41:41.179
( deep voice )
I am the thing that waits... for you!

01:41:42.889 --> 01:41:45.433
( witch cackling )

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:46.893
What the fuck?

01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:48.770
( gurgling )

01:41:55.318 --> 01:41:57.320
( train rattling )

01:42:00.365 --> 01:42:02.617
( P.A. chimes )

01:42:02.784 --> 01:42:04.786
( woman speaking French
over P.A.)

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.963
( train approaching )

01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:33.231
( wheels squeak )

01:42:34.482 --> 01:42:36.192
( beeps )

01:42:41.781 --> 01:42:43.158
( muttering in French )
Damn, I can't believe it.

01:42:43.324 --> 01:42:45.326
Fucking fat girl!

01:42:45.493 --> 01:42:47.495
( train rattling )

01:42:52.375 --> 01:42:53.710
( mutters )

01:43:13.271 --> 01:43:14.606
Man: So, so--

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.024
Look at that gelatin.
Hey, gelatin!

01:43:16.191 --> 01:43:17.734
Hold on, hold on.

01:43:18.735 --> 01:43:20.486
Madame, excuse me.

01:43:20.653 --> 01:43:23.281
You're fat, madame.
You have to do something after a while.

01:43:23.448 --> 01:43:25.783
- Woman: Yes, thanks.
- No, it shows.

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:28.119
( laughs, shouts )

01:43:32.749 --> 01:43:35.043
( mimicking velociraptor )

01:43:37.045 --> 01:43:39.881
You performed in Jurassic Park,
didn't you? The Brontosaurus.

01:43:41.090 --> 01:43:43.468
- Get out, get out!
- ( laughs )

01:43:56.773 --> 01:44:00.944
- Woman: Gosh... look at this.
- ( woman #2 laughs, mutters )

01:44:01.110 --> 01:44:02.904
Hey, take a break on the peanut butter.

01:44:03.071 --> 01:44:05.531
Oh my gosh, if I were her,
I wouldn't go out.

01:44:05.698 --> 01:44:08.368
- Oh my gosh! Hey hey hey, so true!
- ( both laughing )

01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:11.621
Ah ah ah... for sure.
She can't climb up the stairs.

01:44:11.788 --> 01:44:13.957
Woman #2:
Hey, take a ride to the gym!

01:44:18.086 --> 01:44:20.088
- ( TV turns on )
- ( music playing )

01:44:25.218 --> 01:44:27.345
( woman speaking on TV )

01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:31.808
( in French ) Me, with my cereal,
I can manage my summer slimness.

01:44:31.975 --> 01:44:33.476
- ( sloshes )
- ( breathing heavily )

01:44:33.643 --> 01:44:37.063
Slimness, flat tummy...
get ready for the summer!

01:44:41.401 --> 01:44:43.278
With low dye...

01:44:43.444 --> 01:44:45.697
say no to fat!

01:44:49.284 --> 01:44:51.953
- Rich in vitamins...
- ( grunts )

01:44:53.997 --> 01:44:56.708
my body loves it, as you can see!

01:45:02.171 --> 01:45:04.632
Diet cereals make me thinner
and help you keep it!

01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:06.843
( breathing heavily )

01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:27.697
Me, for my hair, I use Protif!

01:45:31.159 --> 01:45:33.161
( heart beating )

01:45:38.333 --> 01:45:40.043
( inhales sharply )

01:45:43.713 --> 01:45:46.632
( inhales sharply )
Ah! Ah!

01:45:46.799 --> 01:45:49.761
( moaning, cries )

01:45:54.182 --> 01:45:56.434
( cries out )

01:46:31.386 --> 01:46:33.554
( yells )

01:46:38.059 --> 01:46:40.061
( yelling )

01:46:41.354 --> 01:46:43.147
( inhales sharply, grunting )

01:46:48.528 --> 01:46:49.862
( clatters )

01:47:08.714 --> 01:47:10.591
( whirring )

01:47:10.758 --> 01:47:12.718
( humming )

01:47:18.766 --> 01:47:20.768
( screaming )

01:47:33.239 --> 01:47:35.241
( electric buzzing )

01:47:54.218 --> 01:47:56.888
Woman on TV: Me, with my cereals,
I can manage my summer...

01:47:57.054 --> 01:47:59.849
With low dye, rich in vitamins...

It's more accurate to say
"fission-cultivated electricity."
