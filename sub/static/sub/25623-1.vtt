00:16.625 --> 00:19.166
Some awesome night.

00:21.416 --> 00:23.500
And did you get any numbers?

00:23.500 --> 00:27.416
I got the number of the ugly one, but the target didn't take the bait yet.

00:27.500 --> 00:30.541
Dude, you gotta change your game.

00:30.541 --> 00:35.125
You got to isolate the target from the group and exploit
the daddy-complex.

00:35.125 --> 00:37.625
How should I do the isolation?

00:37.625 --> 00:42.000
Be a good wingman and do it for me. I'm heading to the friendzone.

00:42.041 --> 00:45.666
Don't use the bad f-word. No one is going to be friendzoned today.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.291
We're gonna take care of it. No worries.

00:57.250 --> 00:58.625
Uuuh, what've we got there?

00:58.625 --> 01:01.125
That cat is pretty much a 8.5.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.500
Can I buy you a drink?

01:10.291 --> 01:18.250
Imagine this: There is a strawberry field with a fence around it.
How high is the fence?

01:19.416 --> 01:20.625
Huh?

01:20.625 --> 01:27.625
You know I mean it symbolically. The height of the fence
symbolizes your sexual inhibitions.

01:28.500 --> 01:31.500
I bet your fence is pretty low, right?

01:32.250 --> 01:35.041
And, are you gonna eat the strawberries?

01:35.041 --> 01:38.125
Are you gonna eat the strawberries?

01:38.125 --> 01:39.500
Are you?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.250
Hey, did you arrive safe and sound?

05:02.250 --> 05:05.250
I was welcomed by some creeps but that was not a problem.

05:05.250 --> 05:07.625
Good, have you already located the target?

05:07.625 --> 05:11.500
I'm gonna do that later. I got the adress. I need to get some sleep first.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.541
Already experienced something exciting?

05:13.541 --> 05:18.125
It's pretty crowded here. And it stinks. People stink and
are drunk and stuff.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.375
Bodies!
Yeah...

05:20.375 --> 05:23.500
Stinking, unwashed, drunk bodies.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.625
wonderful

05:24.625 --> 05:27.125
Apart from that, many people are pretty scary here.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.666
Well, it's the middle ages.

05:28.666 --> 05:31.375
Yeah, exactly. And right now I'm in a park.

05:31.375 --> 05:33.125
With grass and everything?

05:33.125 --> 05:36.625
Mmmh, grass, trees and there even was a lake somewhere.

05:36.625 --> 05:39.250
Isn't it a bit dangerous, because of the mutants?

05:39.250 --> 05:40.750
No mutants.

05:40.750 --> 05:44.166
Oh man, I wanna go to the past, too.

05:46.916 --> 05:48.166
Is something wrong with you?

05:49.791 --> 05:51.375
They caught dad yesterday.

05:51.375 --> 05:53.875
Fuck! How come?

05:53.875 --> 05:57.375
He was hunting with some other guys in the outskirts of town.

05:57.375 --> 06:00.916
A guarding uniut busted them.

06:00.916 --> 06:04.416
Some of them could run away. My father couldn't.

06:05.541 --> 06:06.875
And what now?

06:08.250 --> 06:11.916
I assume they already digitalized him. We haven't heard anything yet.

06:11.916 --> 06:14.500
Damn it, Luna, I feel so bad!

06:15.666 --> 06:21.500
You don't have to. You are dealing with the same shit, even worse.
At least I've still got my mom.

06:21.500 --> 06:24.166
Speaking of which, has anyone heard of mine?

06:24.166 --> 06:31.375
Umm, pretty calm said XD-458. But we have to be careful.
If they find out about this operation--

06:31.416 --> 06:33.250
Yeah, I'm gonna hurry.

06:34.875 --> 06:37.500
Oh maaan, why is everything so fucked up?

06:37.500 --> 06:39.916
Well, you are there now to fix everything.

06:39.916 --> 06:42.500
Yeah, right after I've slept. Promise.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.250
Great, see you later.

13:13.708 --> 13:15.791
Is this a water pistol?

13:21.416 --> 13:22.666
Do I know you?

13:27.291 --> 13:31.041
Ok...uhmm. I wanted to go to the Alster-lake to drink some Alster-beer.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.833
Yeah, I know. Nobody thinks it's funny.

13:36.916 --> 13:38.666
Is there anything you want? Otherwise, I'm going.

13:42.416 --> 13:43.791
Or do you wanna join me?

13:57.291 --> 14:01.541
Do you do this often? Threaten people with a
water pistol to scrounge beer?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.916
Do you always just sit and drink here?

14:03.916 --> 14:05.791
Lately, kind of.

14:05.791 --> 14:07.583
And I feed the ducks.

14:07.583 --> 14:10.166
You grandpa!

14:10.166 --> 14:11.458
Look

14:17.666 --> 14:21.541
And now don't say this isn't awesome.
It's pretty awesome, right?

14:23.833 --> 14:26.291
You've got some lame hobbies...

14:26.291 --> 14:29.291
Says the girl with the water pistol.

14:50.916 --> 14:53.458
Hey, nothing changed so far. Is everything ok?

14:54.375 --> 14:56.125
Kind of.

14:56.291 --> 14:58.500
What happened?

14:58.541 --> 15:00.291
You haven't shot him yet?

15:00.416 --> 15:01.333
No.

15:01.541 --> 15:03.250
Why not?

15:03.333 --> 15:06.625
I met him today and we had a drink,

15:06.625 --> 15:08.000
and fed ducks.

15:08.333 --> 15:09.583
WHAT?!

15:09.666 --> 15:10.625
Yeah...

15:10.750 --> 15:12.291
That was not the plan!

15:12.291 --> 15:13.541
No...

15:15.041 --> 15:16.625
You think he's cute.

15:16.666 --> 15:21.958
Maybe a little. I definitely didn't want to shoot him. He seems nice.

15:22.041 --> 15:26.375
Oh man ... Alright, and now? Are you gonna shoot him tomorrow?

15:26.500 --> 15:27.583
No!

15:27.625 --> 15:28.875
I'm gonna try to make him change his mind.

15:28.916 --> 15:31.041
You know that we don't have much time left, right?

15:31.041 --> 15:35.458
I haven't suddenly gone dumb, but I just don't think it's
necessary to kill this guy.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.000
Just let me talk to him. I don't like to shoot nice people.

15:38.041 --> 15:42.416
It's getting worse every day and I believe that the
guards are on our heels.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.500
I still have 3 days until it gets serious, right?

15:46.166 --> 15:50.000
That's the deadline, yeah, but what if your mom --

15:50.041 --> 15:52.625
Just give me time until tomorrow night and I will let you know...

15:52.833 --> 15:55.958
I haven't talked to him yet but he seems like a reasonable person.

15:55.958 --> 15:57.416
Aqua, you are acting weird.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.375
What are you doing there, huh?! What are you doing there?

17:18.375 --> 17:19.915
Oh, oh sorry.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.915
Don't sorry me, asshole!

17:22.415 --> 17:25.665
Who pisses on a strangers tent? What's wrong with you?

17:27.415 --> 17:30.166
Keep this in mind and tell your friends.

17:41.416 --> 17:48.541
Nothing grows here Taylor, there is nothing in the ground.
Only minor traces of cardiumhydrate.

17:48.541 --> 17:51.458
We won't find any living thing in this region.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.916
No dangerous radiation?

17:53.958 --> 17:55.333
No.

17:55.416 --> 18:04.208
Alright, let's hit the road then. 72 hours is not that much time.
They should find something by then.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.041
Alright let's go. Which way?

18:06.041 --> 18:07.541
I would say this way.

18:07.541 --> 18:09.541
Do you have a specific reason for that?

18:09.541 --> 18:11.333
Not at all.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.916
Alright, then.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.583
Yeah, I know. Creepy right?

18:21.916 --> 18:23.041
Pretty much.

18:23.041 --> 18:26.208
Let's just ignore how creepy this is for a moment and
go to the playground.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.125
To the--

18:27.125 --> 18:31.000
Yeah, I know I discovered it on my way here.
We don't have those anymore. There are even swings!

18:31.041 --> 18:36.125
Yeah... I.. uhmm I'm watching something right now.

18:36.125 --> 18:39.583
Come on, please! I got beer!

18:41.375 --> 18:42.916
Okay...

18:42.916 --> 18:45.541
Okay? Are you coming?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.458
Yeah.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.083
Cool.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.125
Ok, who are you?

18:59.458 --> 19:01.083
Can we first talk about something else?

19:03.666 --> 19:04.916
Sure.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.916
What?

19:06.916 --> 19:09.416
Umm, what were you watching?

19:09.458 --> 19:13.166
Planet of the Apes. The first one. The original one from the 60s.

19:13.166 --> 19:14.333
With Charlton Heston?

19:14.333 --> 19:15.958
Yeah, that one!

19:16.041 --> 19:18.458
I think the remakes are awesome. So I wanted to rewatch the old ones.

19:18.541 --> 19:19.791
There are so many of them.

19:19.791 --> 19:23.583
Remakes?
Ah, you mean the James Franco one and its sequels.

19:23.666 --> 19:24.666
Right.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.541
I liked them all, except the seventh one.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.916
There are only two.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.041
Right. Of course.

19:29.041 --> 19:31.291
I like both of them.

19:31.291 --> 19:34.166
The Charlton Heston movie is very long.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.416
Very, very long.

19:36.416 --> 19:39.208
And sexually disturbing somehow.

19:39.291 --> 19:40.541
What do you mean?

19:40.541 --> 19:41.791
Did you ever watch the movie?

19:41.833 --> 19:43.541
As a kid, once.

19:43.583 --> 19:51.041
Ok, do you remember that in the beginning there are three male
and one female astronaut, who visit the future and arrive at
an undiscovered world.

19:51.041 --> 19:52.291
Yeah, vaguely.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.416
She dies, right?

19:53.458 --> 19:57.083
Yeah, at first I thought she turned into an ape. Looked like it.

19:57.083 --> 20:00.833
But she was just a mummy. They had been traveling for 2000 years.

20:00.916 --> 20:05.541
Anyway, later in the movie Charlton Heston says he thought
she had been really hot.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.916
And that the had been supposed to become the Eve in
the new paradise.

20:07.916 --> 20:12.583
That means those guys just traveled somewhere, so the three
of them could mount the woman.

20:12.666 --> 20:13.458
Ew.

20:13.458 --> 20:19.333
And not just "ew". It doesn't even make strategical sense.
Wouldn't it be more clever with three female and one male astronaut?

20:19.416 --> 20:21.208
There could be way more new people much faster, that way!

20:21.208 --> 20:21.916
Right.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.958
And there was this love interest for him. Do you remember?

20:24.958 --> 20:25.916
No.

20:25.916 --> 20:29.458
One of these underdeveloped humans on the ape
planet who was imprisoned with him.

20:29.458 --> 20:33.083
They put them in the same cage and she fell in love
with him immediately.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.666
Like every woman in the movie.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.166
Including the ape woman.

20:36.166 --> 20:39.916
She followed him around constantly and wore tiny rags,

20:39.916 --> 20:41.083
almost naked.

20:41.083 --> 20:43.666
And she was always either tied up or in a cage,

20:43.666 --> 20:46.041
never said a word and was horny all the time.

20:46.083 --> 20:47.458
Entirely a fetish object.

20:47.458 --> 20:49.708
The movie sounds so disgusting the way you describe it.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.916
Yeah and in the end he kisses the ape-woman.

20:51.916 --> 20:55.041
And her ape-fiancee stands right next to them and
everybody thinks it's ok.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.041
Well, that one doesn't really sound as disgusting as the rest.

20:57.041 --> 20:59.041
He kisses the ape-woman.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.416
Bestiality is not cool.

21:01.416 --> 21:03.208
You are just chilling, like, every day, right?

21:03.208 --> 21:06.916
Kind of, right now. Well, almost...

21:06.916 --> 21:11.666
I'm working on something at the moment but it doesn't take
that much time.

21:11.666 --> 21:14.291
I've earned some chilling.

21:14.291 --> 21:16.416
How?

21:17.708 --> 21:19.291
I'm really hungry. Let's go eat something.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.916
I'm gonna take fried noodles.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.166
I'll take the same.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.791
How is it?

22:24.791 --> 22:25.791
It's shitty right?

22:25.791 --> 22:28.041
It tastes really shitty.

22:28.041 --> 22:29.291
I'm sorry.

22:29.291 --> 22:31.041
It's not your fault.

22:31.041 --> 22:33.666
Kinda. It was my idea. Now I feel responsible.

22:33.666 --> 22:35.291
Nonsense.

22:35.416 --> 22:38.416
I don't want to eat anymore. You were so hungry, do you want mine?

22:38.416 --> 22:44.916
Nah. I want to cook myself. I don't want to
eat any shitty food anymore for the rest of my life.

22:44.958 --> 22:50.166
You got high standards. I eat shitty food all the time.
That's the way to stay skinny, cause you can't eat that much then.

22:50.166 --> 22:53.666
Great diet tipp. You should sell it.

22:58.083 --> 22:59.916
It smells like feet.

22:59.958 --> 23:03.833
Shut up. It's the main ingredient of our meal.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.291
Huh?

23:06.291 --> 23:07.958
Fish sauce.

23:08.041 --> 23:10.666
We'll pour it over everything. It's awesome!

23:10.666 --> 23:12.916
But it smells like feet.

23:12.916 --> 23:16.416
You are gonna get used to it.

23:16.458 --> 23:18.916
We still have the noodle boxes.

23:18.916 --> 23:21.166
Don't be so ignorant and just cut the carrots.

23:21.166 --> 23:24.166
You're such a kitchen nazi!

23:24.166 --> 23:26.791
Do you know MasterChef?

23:26.791 --> 23:28.291
What's that?

23:28.291 --> 23:31.083
It's a cooking program, a reality show.

23:31.166 --> 23:34.166
Like American Idol, just for cooks.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.583
Why are you talking like that?

23:36.583 --> 23:40.041
Are you not watching TV?

23:40.041 --> 23:41.833
Are you one of those Waldorf kids?

23:41.833 --> 23:44.666
There is no TV where I'm from.

23:44.666 --> 23:51.958
I mean we have harddiscs with movies and some series but TV in
that sense has been extinct for a very long time.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.291
Ok, where are you from?

23:54.791 --> 23:59.291
Later. You wanted to tell me about MasterChef?

23:59.333 --> 24:00.458
Right, MasterChef.

24:00.541 --> 24:02.208
MasterChef is, like, really awesome, you know?

24:02.208 --> 24:07.083
They cook for the competion, some amateur-cooks, and in the
end someone is always eliminated.

24:07.083 --> 24:10.041
And they use epic music as if it's The Lord of the Rings.

24:10.041 --> 24:13.791
Every time I watch it, I feel like cooking something special.

24:13.791 --> 24:18.666
I used to watch it with my friends and we ordered pizza. That was nice.

24:19.666 --> 24:25.416
Ok, the carrots are ready.

24:25.416 --> 24:26.916
And what now?

24:26.916 --> 24:32.208
Ok, we are gonna put all of these in a pot and then we need salad.

24:32.208 --> 24:35.958
We're gonna take care of the noodles later.
Otherwise they'll be overcooked.

24:35.958 --> 24:38.958
You could cut the salad and I'm taking care of the rice plates.

24:39.041 --> 24:43.291
I always have to do the cutting.
You don't trust me and you think I can't cook.

24:43.291 --> 24:44.666
Can you cook?

24:44.666 --> 24:47.041
No, I hate it.

25:07.291 --> 25:09.958
The sauce still smells like feet.

25:09.958 --> 25:11.541
But it tastes awesome, right?

25:11.541 --> 25:13.291
Mmmh, I like it.

25:13.291 --> 25:14.833
You're a great cook.

25:14.833 --> 25:16.458
But just easy stuff like that.

25:18.166 --> 25:19.791
This is not easy stuff!

25:19.791 --> 25:21.416
I've never eaten something like that.

25:21.416 --> 25:23.958
What? Viatnemese is really hip right now.

25:23.958 --> 25:25.291
You get it at every corner.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.291
Not, where I'm from.

25:27.291 --> 25:29.083
Where I'm from...

25:29.166 --> 25:32.708
you'd get NOTHING at any corner and it's pretty dark in general.

25:32.708 --> 25:35.708
Ok you should really start telling me your story.

25:35.708 --> 25:39.041
You are nice and stuff but also scary.

25:39.041 --> 25:40.291
Thanks.

25:41.416 --> 25:46.416
Come on, you said it yourself this morning! It was creepy
of you to you suddenly appear in front of my door.

25:48.666 --> 25:51.041
You go first, tell me what's the deal with you.

25:53.291 --> 25:54.791
I have cancer.

25:54.791 --> 25:56.541
Oh fuck, bad?

25:57.583 --> 26:02.083
Whoa, no one has ever reacted this calmly.

26:02.541 --> 26:07.916
I've experimented a little, how to tell people and how to get
the best reactions.

26:07.916 --> 26:09.541
You know, just during small talk,

26:09.541 --> 26:12.041
I mean- usually people cry.

26:12.041 --> 26:15.791
Sorry, I have a heart of stone.

26:16.083 --> 26:18.041
So, you're gonna die.

26:18.041 --> 26:18.541
Yep.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.041
Pretty soon.

26:20.541 --> 26:21.583
In, like, 30 days.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.666
You seem fit.

26:27.666 --> 26:29.041
I feel fit.

26:29.041 --> 26:30.666
That's the nastiest part.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.666
Most of the time I don't feel sick at all.

26:42.291 --> 26:43.458
What's your name?

26:43.541 --> 26:44.583
My name is Aqua.

26:49.166 --> 26:50.791
What kind of name is that?

26:50.833 --> 26:51.916
That's not a name.

26:52.083 --> 26:53.791
It's a name where I'm from.

26:53.791 --> 26:54.583
It means water.

26:55.208 --> 26:56.208
Ok, where are you from?

26:57.166 --> 27:03.458
Ok, I'm gonna tell you but only if you tell me first why you don't give a
shit that you're gonna die soon.

27:06.708 --> 27:07.458
Alright.

27:08.666 --> 27:09.583
But don't laugh.

27:10.916 --> 27:12.041
I won't.

27:13.666 --> 27:14.541
I won't die.

27:15.916 --> 27:16.541
Hmm.

27:18.833 --> 27:20.666
You don't seem surprised.

27:21.416 --> 27:23.041
I'm just gonna listen to you first.

27:27.666 --> 27:29.958
This body will die, but I won't.

27:31.083 --> 27:32.000
Which means?

27:34.333 --> 27:35.166
I'll show you.

27:38.291 --> 27:39.375
That's it.

27:40.541 --> 27:41.458
What?

27:42.166 --> 27:43.500
My invention.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.833
I'm almost done.

27:46.166 --> 27:47.916
It looks adventurous.

27:48.750 --> 27:49.791
It's revolutionary.

27:51.666 --> 27:52.416
What can it do?

27:54.083 --> 27:56.125
I am able to upload my mind in a computer

27:56.125 --> 28:00.250
and the second I organize a reasonable robot
body, I can place my mind in it and survive.

28:02.458 --> 28:06.708
Yeah...

28:08.208 --> 28:09.583
You are strange.

28:09.750 --> 28:15.333
Everyone else said I'm crazy, that it would never work and
it's silly and all that.

28:15.333 --> 28:17.250
And it would be just some grieving phase.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.541
Another reason why I wanted to get rid of them.

28:19.625 --> 28:22.333
Everyone was crying around but no one could see how ingenius thit is.

28:24.083 --> 28:26.916
No, I...I believe you.

28:26.916 --> 28:28.416
Why aren't you excited then?

28:30.333 --> 28:31.541
Ok, my turn.

28:32.958 --> 28:33.791
I'm listening.

28:35.416 --> 28:41.500
I'm from the future. Your technology is revolutionary, successful
and 20 years from now people will stop dying.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.375
Well, the ones who can afford it.

28:45.750 --> 28:46.750
Very funny.

28:47.166 --> 28:49.875
No, I - I'm serious. You need to listen to me.

28:49.916 --> 28:51.916
You're mocking me and I don't think it's funny.

28:55.708 --> 28:58.041
It's not a water pistol but a laser gun!

28:58.041 --> 28:58.916
Do you believe me now?

28:58.916 --> 29:00.291
You wanted to shoot me with that?

29:00.291 --> 29:01.583
Yeah, that's my mission.

29:02.375 --> 29:04.333
It's your mission to kill me?

29:04.375 --> 29:08.375
Listen to me, it's important: 100 years from now
the world will suck because of you!

29:08.458 --> 29:12.041
Ever thought about how unnecessary bodies get if
you don't need them anymore?

29:12.125 --> 29:14.416
Just from an economic point of view?

29:14.416 --> 29:17.416
Yeah, whoever can afford it gets a robot body

29:17.416 --> 29:19.250
and walks around with agility.

29:19.250 --> 29:20.583
For example cops,

29:20.583 --> 29:22.500
rich people, slaves of the government.

29:22.500 --> 29:25.958
It's fucking 2116 and Donald Trump is still alive!

29:25.958 --> 29:29.500
First it was a privilege to upload yourself and have a robot body.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.583
But then people with human bodies were increasingly stigmatized.

29:32.583 --> 29:35.083
Disgusting, filthy, in the end they're all parasites.

29:35.166 --> 29:38.166
And our new government has made it compulsory that
we upload ourselves.

29:38.166 --> 29:42.291
And it's not like that we'd get new bodies. No! We're supposed to live in computers.
This way we'd save space.

29:42.291 --> 29:44.500
And they promote it as some kind of a paradise.

29:44.500 --> 29:47.750
"Being immortal", "no problems anymore".
And more and more people are going with it!

29:47.750 --> 29:50.291
They leave their bodies to live in computers.

29:50.291 --> 29:51.791
No more overpopulation.

29:51.791 --> 29:54.291
And the pollution fucked up our planet badly.

29:54.291 --> 29:56.000
So you hardly not able to live there with a body anyway.

29:56.000 --> 30:00.458
There are aggressively mutated animals in every city, who are dangerous,
especially near water.

30:00.500 --> 30:06.000
And people with real bodies have had to live in
illegal settlements at the outskirts of cities for a long time now.

30:06.000 --> 30:09.250
And it's getting more difficult everyday to find something
to eat and to drink.

30:09.250 --> 30:13.083
And we are chased by the robot cops constantly, who want to
force us into the digitalization.

30:14.458 --> 30:17.291
Yes, your technology solves lots of problems.

30:17.291 --> 30:22.291
But the android phase is temporary and the entire
human race will be living in a computer program, very soon.

30:22.291 --> 30:25.000
And who ever doesn't want to do that will be just forced into it.

30:25.000 --> 30:28.791
They digitilized the father of my best friend yesterday. Just like that.

30:28.791 --> 30:30.708
It looks really bad for the world.

30:30.708 --> 30:31.916
Do you get that?

30:33.500 --> 30:34.708
That sounds crazy

30:35.875 --> 30:36.500
and stupid.

30:37.916 --> 30:40.333
And... I want you to leave now.

30:42.375 --> 30:45.250
I could've shot you when we first met.

30:45.250 --> 30:48.083
But I wanted to give you a chance to make the right decision.

30:48.083 --> 30:52.125
Wow, instead of shooting me you want to talk me into
dying from cancer?

30:52.166 --> 30:53.750
Either way, you wanna see me die.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.083
Just leave, I feel sick.

30:56.125 --> 30:57.583
I could shoot you now!

30:57.583 --> 30:58.583
DO IT THEN!

31:02.375 --> 31:03.375
Fuck you!

31:05.666 --> 31:07.250
Just shoot him already!

31:07.291 --> 31:10.166
You remember the guarding units who caught my dad?

31:10.166 --> 31:11.375
Yes.

31:11.375 --> 31:13.291
We saw a couple of them today as well.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.750
They were closer to the camp than ever before.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.666
They are on our heels.

31:17.708 --> 31:19.833
No one even dares to go hunting.

31:19.875 --> 31:22.166
Some of us think that the government suspects something.

31:22.166 --> 31:23.916
And you know who they would send then.

31:23.916 --> 31:25.625
I still have 2 more days.

31:25.625 --> 31:26.958
Maybe not.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.875
Maybe they'll catch us before you can do anything.

31:28.875 --> 31:30.875
Or maybe they'll catch you.

31:30.875 --> 31:32.791
I won't get caught, especially not by her!

31:32.791 --> 31:35.375
And whatever happens to you, I'll undo it anyway.

31:35.416 --> 31:37.208
Those are some high risks you're taking.

31:37.875 --> 31:39.083
I just think, I can change his mind.

31:39.083 --> 31:40.250
But he is right.

31:40.250 --> 31:43.500
It won't make any difference. He is gonna die either way.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.708
You never had a problem with killing someone.

31:46.750 --> 31:50.666
Yeah, but robots or evil people. It's different this time.

31:50.708 --> 31:53.375
You are such a stupid, little girl Aqua.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.666
You are risking all our lives, just because you think he is a bit cute.

31:56.708 --> 32:00.416
No, I don't. Come on, be on my side. We can win this
without bloodshed.

32:00.416 --> 32:02.541
I don't care about bloodshed.

32:02.541 --> 32:04.625
I want that the digitalization to be stopped.

32:04.666 --> 32:07.250
And I will take care of it.

32:07.291 --> 32:13.083
Telling someone to die rather then use his seminal
technology to live forever?

32:13.125 --> 32:14.125
You're out of your mind!

32:14.125 --> 32:16.166
He will become something like a god after all!

32:16.166 --> 32:17.875
I'm not gonna tell him that.

32:17.916 --> 32:19.125
And what's your strategy?

32:20.250 --> 32:22.416
Why don't you want to be digitalized?

32:22.458 --> 32:24.375
Because it's wrong,

32:24.375 --> 32:26.500
You feel nothing, you are not alive.

32:26.500 --> 32:30.125
What am I without..myself?

32:30.291 --> 32:32.625
Exactly. I'm gonna show him that.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.125
In one day?

32:36.208 --> 32:40.208
I'm gonna shoot him, the second he tries to connect
himself to his machine and upload is mind, ok?

32:40.250 --> 32:43.625
The historical date is the day after tomorrow.
I'll give him time until then.

32:43.666 --> 32:44.666
Ok.

32:45.625 --> 32:48.583
I'm still worried about those guarding units.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.875
Me too.

32:49.875 --> 32:51.791
Keep me updated.

33:06.750 --> 33:08.291
What do you want?

33:09.666 --> 33:13.458
The world I'm from is hell and for the most part it's your fault.

33:15.083 --> 33:16.583
Sorry.

33:17.083 --> 33:20.958
You have to show me some nice stuff
which doesn't exist anymore in the future because of you.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.666
You are crazy.

33:23.291 --> 33:27.791
Says the boy who wants to turn himself into a computer
with his machine in the basement.

33:28.958 --> 33:29.458
Ok.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.000
What do you want to do?

33:49.416 --> 33:53.666
This sucks. Can we not play something else?
I don't even know this game.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.375
You don't know badminton?

33:56.375 --> 33:58.375
Everyone knows badminton.

33:59.375 --> 34:03.708
No, I just know your era from the movies I've watched with my dad.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.333
We could play rollerball

34:06.333 --> 34:07.166
or jagga?

34:07.250 --> 34:08.416
Or battle royale?

34:08.416 --> 34:09.416
Or quidditch?

34:12.208 --> 34:14.250
Your dad watches some weird movies with you.

34:14.250 --> 34:16.041
Shut the fuck up and don't say anything against my dad.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.208
He is dead.

34:17.750 --> 34:18.583
I'm sorry.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.083
What about your mom?

34:22.500 --> 34:24.625
She is a fucking cunt!

34:25.583 --> 34:27.083
It's way too cold for swimming.

34:27.083 --> 34:28.833
Come on, there are no mutants in the water.

34:28.833 --> 34:29.833
I want to swim.

34:29.833 --> 34:31.500
It's the Elbe river, I'm sure there is something mutated in it.

34:31.500 --> 34:32.583
But everyone swims in here and

34:32.583 --> 34:33.333
no one dies.

34:33.333 --> 34:33.375
no one dies.
Looks safe to me.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.166
Looks safe to me.

34:36.041 --> 34:36.750
Join me.

34:40.666 --> 34:41.791
It's cold.

34:43.416 --> 34:44.708
I told you so.

34:49.041 --> 34:50.250
It's amazing.

34:52.625 --> 34:54.291
You can't swim, right?

34:54.333 --> 34:55.083
No.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.583
There is nothing this awesome in the future.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.166
We only have sprouts and radish.

35:27.791 --> 35:28.583
Do you believe in god?

35:29.833 --> 35:31.000
Tough question...

35:32.916 --> 35:33.958
But this is what it's about.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.125
You want me to die just like that.

35:37.166 --> 35:37.916
Do you believe in god?

35:39.333 --> 35:40.125
No.

35:42.833 --> 35:43.916
What do you think happens then?

35:45.750 --> 35:48.291
Nothing, I think there's nothing.

35:48.291 --> 35:50.000
Just nothing?

35:50.000 --> 35:51.041
Just nothing.

35:52.916 --> 35:54.458
Imagine.

35:56.250 --> 35:57.458
What do you mean?

35:57.458 --> 36:00.500
Close your eyes. Just imagine you die and there is nothing after that.

36:02.083 --> 36:05.083
I'm serious. What's so funny about it?

36:05.083 --> 36:10.458
You want me to die. And I want you
to understand what that means exactly.

36:18.958 --> 36:20.541
There is nothing anymore.

36:21.791 --> 36:23.083
Everything dissolves.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.541
You dissolve.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.625
Imagine that.

36:39.833 --> 36:40.958
Sucks, right?

36:42.541 --> 36:44.291
It's hard to imagine.

36:44.291 --> 36:47.750
Yes! I mean, look

36:47.791 --> 36:50.666
I only see the world with my eyes.

36:50.708 --> 36:53.833
My world exists just because I perceive it.

36:53.875 --> 36:56.083
I don't know how you perceive the world.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.000
What 'green' means to you.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.625
If 'green' looks the same for you as for me.

37:01.125 --> 37:05.083
Did you know that the color 'blue' got its name way later
than all the other colors?

37:05.125 --> 37:07.416
No one could see it before.

37:08.583 --> 37:10.166
It's just an assumption that the sky is blue.

37:10.166 --> 37:11.416
Because we say so.

37:12.500 --> 37:17.000
Someone once made an experiment and didn't tell his
daughter what color the sky was.

37:18.125 --> 37:20.833
Only after she had learned all the colors he asked her.

37:20.875 --> 37:22.416
She couldn't tell.

37:23.375 --> 37:25.083
She inclined to see it as grey.

37:26.708 --> 37:29.791
My world exists just because I perceive it.

37:29.833 --> 37:33.375
My world ends, when I end.

37:33.833 --> 37:36.833
Everything falls apart. I fall apart.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.500
The endless loneliness.

37:40.250 --> 37:43.583
I think that's the worst part. The loneliness.

37:45.333 --> 37:48.041
If you die, you have to go alone.

37:48.083 --> 37:50.666
Nobody joins you. You are all by yourself.

37:50.666 --> 37:51.833
And you don't even know where you are going.

37:55.125 --> 37:58.458
You say god doesn't exist.

37:58.458 --> 38:02.666
Ok, I can understand that.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.416
It makes sense.

38:04.458 --> 38:05.583
But what if he does?

38:06.333 --> 38:08.750
And what if what happens next really sucks?

38:10.500 --> 38:11.833
Just imagine.

38:12.541 --> 38:14.000
That's bullshit.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.875
That's what you say but can you prove it?

38:18.166 --> 38:19.375
I'm so afraid Aqua.

38:19.375 --> 38:20.791
I'm so fucking scared.

38:23.666 --> 38:26.000
And I don't see anything good about death. I really don't.

38:27.916 --> 38:30.625
In what kind of way should it be something good?

38:30.625 --> 38:32.916
I just see crap in it. Lots of crap.

38:34.875 --> 38:36.166
And I don't want that.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.416
And I've found a way to avoid it.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.250
I don't wanna die.

38:41.291 --> 38:44.583
But isn't death what makes life what it is?

38:44.583 --> 38:46.750
What kind of craptalk is that?

38:46.750 --> 38:49.125
That's a fucking postal card quote!

38:50.041 --> 38:51.291
But everyone will die some day.

38:51.291 --> 38:53.000
It's just the way it is.

38:53.041 --> 38:54.750
It can't be wrong.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.250
Is that some kind of argument for nature?

38:57.083 --> 38:57.958
Well,

38:58.625 --> 38:59.458
yes!

38:59.458 --> 39:00.416
That's such bullshit!

39:01.000 --> 39:03.416
Everyones' teeth decay and we still brush it.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.416
Everyone stinks and we still wash ourselves.

39:06.416 --> 39:08.666
Certain things which happen to us naturally just suck.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.708
But if we can do something about it, then we do it.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.750
But just think about it how scary it is.

39:14.791 --> 39:19.666
Isn't it lonely in a computer?
Isn't it spooky to exist as a data cloud forever?

39:19.666 --> 39:23.333
Ever thought for a longer time about forever and how scary all that is?

39:23.583 --> 39:25.041
You don't get my machine.

39:25.041 --> 39:27.333
No Leon, you don't get your machine!

39:27.375 --> 39:30.625
I have lived my whole life with your technology and it's fucked up.

39:33.791 --> 39:36.750
My idea is not that everyone will live in a machine forever.

39:36.833 --> 39:38.541
I've thought about artificial bodies.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.958
My concept is really far developed.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.083
Yeah and you're gonna realize it. And you'll become a star
and you'll become very rich

39:45.083 --> 39:49.125
and one day you'll isolate yourself and go into your program
because you'll lose touch.

39:49.166 --> 39:52.041
The mind can't survive separation from the body without damage.

39:52.083 --> 39:54.041
And something fundemental will break inside of you.

39:54.083 --> 39:57.208
Just think about it, you're not gonna feel anything.

39:57.208 --> 39:58.625
Nothing will be real.

39:59.833 --> 40:01.916
A fake body can't feel anything?

40:01.916 --> 40:03.791
You're already starting to doubt everything now!

40:03.833 --> 40:06.791
Do you think it'll be better when you know, that you have built
your body yourself?

40:06.791 --> 40:09.000
You're gonna know for sure that NOTHING is real.

40:09.000 --> 40:12.333
And then you'll shut yourself into your
weird program where everything is perfect.

40:12.333 --> 40:15.333
And all your machine-zombies will follow you one by one.

40:15.458 --> 40:17.666
Which means I'll lead humanity into paradise.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.125
There is no paradise!

40:19.125 --> 40:20.958
It has nothing to do with the real world!

40:22.083 --> 40:28.000
Isn't it a common saying that there is no hell, that we are already
living in it?

40:28.000 --> 40:32.458
Oh shut up! Do you think would be beer this awesome in hell?

40:32.458 --> 40:34.375
I'm sure there would be in my paradise program.

40:36.791 --> 40:38.541
But it's not gonna be real.

40:38.541 --> 40:40.166
This is real.

40:44.166 --> 40:46.416
Life doesn't have to be perfect.

40:46.458 --> 40:50.666
It has to be real! At some point, it ends. So what?

40:50.666 --> 40:55.041
Easy to say that when your own life isn't going to
be over in about a month.

41:11.833 --> 41:14.125
Good morning dear world,
It's a lovely day.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.333
The world is colorful and not grey anymore
like when it was under a shadow before.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.500
And now the sun is shining.

41:18.500 --> 41:21.833
My fortunes finally changing.

41:23.208 --> 41:27.666
I always thought fate hated me
But now it makes us into a 'we'.

41:29.958 --> 41:33.875
The prettiest cashier in the world!

41:33.916 --> 41:39.000
I don't know her name
But I'm sure I'm gonna like it.

41:39.000 --> 41:43.333
And I'm happy
as if it were the first day of my life

41:43.333 --> 41:47.833
And I'm asking myself
if this much perfection is possible?

41:47.833 --> 41:52.125
I am new
And the world shows me the wonderfull life

41:52.125 --> 41:57.291
And if this is a dream,
Please, please, please don't wake me up

41:58.791 --> 42:01.208
I'm pretty tired.

42:01.208 --> 42:03.458
I'll walk you home.

42:03.458 --> 42:04.625
What?

42:07.250 --> 42:08.958
Is that not the right thing to do?

42:09.583 --> 42:12.833
It's dark. I can bring you home.

42:13.708 --> 42:16.375
I can take care of myself.

42:16.875 --> 42:18.041
I know.

42:18.916 --> 42:21.083
I don't want to take care of you. I just want to walk you home.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.083
Ok.

42:25.083 --> 42:28.875
And I'm happy
as if it were the first day of my life.

42:28.916 --> 42:33.541
And I ask myself
if this much perfection is possible?

42:33.541 --> 42:36.125
Are you mad at me?

42:36.125 --> 42:37.500
No.

42:38.916 --> 42:41.083
But you're not saying anything.

42:42.541 --> 42:44.458
I'm thinking.

42:45.916 --> 42:49.791
I didn't want to be mean or insensitive.

42:49.875 --> 42:50.666
It's ok.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.458
You're probably right somehow.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.125
Yes, I am!

42:56.958 --> 43:00.458
You know, I just don't wanna die.

43:00.458 --> 43:02.250
Screw reality and all that.

43:02.291 --> 43:05.625
I don't care if what I perceive is real or not. As long as
I am able to perceive.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.166
As long as I am able to do something.

43:07.625 --> 43:09.708
As long as I am able to be happy.

43:09.708 --> 43:13.125
But... if something is not real. You don't really perceive it.

43:13.125 --> 43:16.000
You are nothing then.

43:16.708 --> 43:18.625
I don't know.

43:18.625 --> 43:20.208
Now is real.

43:20.208 --> 43:21.541
Right now.

43:22.791 --> 43:25.500
I'm terminally ill and I'm gonna die soon.

43:26.041 --> 43:31.041
I have horrible headaches even though I stuffed myself with painkillers.

43:31.083 --> 43:33.208
What is it worth that this is real?

43:48.166 --> 43:50.500
What are you doing?

43:50.583 --> 43:54.208
This is real, right? And it's worth something.

45:21.833 --> 45:25.041
In the future, this doesn't exist anymore.

45:25.083 --> 45:27.041
What?

45:27.125 --> 45:28.500
Beaches?

45:28.541 --> 45:30.333
At least not where we live.

45:32.250 --> 45:34.250
Why?

45:34.250 --> 45:38.250
Mainly because of the war but no one cares
about the environment in general anyway.

45:38.291 --> 45:43.000
Now that everybody lives in your program it's not needed anymore.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.333
Yep.

45:45.375 --> 45:46.875
That's practical.

45:52.166 --> 45:59.000
As a kid I always found it disgusting that ancient egyptians pulled the
brains through the nose with tongs before mummifying a dead body.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.083
Ew.

46:00.125 --> 46:03.416
Yeah, that's what I learned in school.

46:03.500 --> 46:05.041
You didn't?

46:05.041 --> 46:06.583
School...

46:07.041 --> 46:13.333
Yeah, I know. No school or anything else anymore. And it's all my fault.

46:13.416 --> 46:17.333
There must be great schools in my program.

46:17.416 --> 46:20.041
Do they digitalize kids as well?

46:20.083 --> 46:23.750
Even newborn babies if they get them.

46:23.750 --> 46:25.541
That's tough.

46:26.583 --> 46:29.458
Oh Man, that's terrible.

46:30.083 --> 46:32.333
Is it possible to reproduce inside the computer program?

46:32.375 --> 46:34.375
Nope, humanity will be kind of extinct.

46:34.375 --> 46:39.041
I mean, people stop dying. But they don't develop anymore.

46:39.125 --> 46:41.166
Does this mean, that one day there will be no kids anymore?

46:41.166 --> 46:42.375
No.

46:42.375 --> 46:46.750
Probably, people in the program are all like...27.

46:48.125 --> 46:51.500
Do you think 27 is the perfect age?

46:52.833 --> 46:54.708
Of course.

46:57.166 --> 47:01.291
I used to think I would reach the high point of my life at 50.

47:02.541 --> 47:05.500
And now I won't even become 30.

47:09.583 --> 47:10.958
I think I have convinced him.

47:11.000 --> 47:14.541
I'm pretty sure he has understood it and that we can disable
and break the stupid thing now.

47:14.541 --> 47:16.625
He understood! I'm the best!

47:16.666 --> 47:18.458
Unfortunately you were too slow.

47:18.583 --> 47:20.750
Why? My deadline is tonight.

47:20.791 --> 47:23.208
I told you everyone got nervous.

47:23.250 --> 47:26.791
They have sent XB10-3 to bring your mission to an end.

47:26.833 --> 47:27.875
They did WHAT?

47:27.875 --> 47:30.750
He is more reliable than you are and everyone is worrying here.

47:30.791 --> 47:32.208
You can't be serious!

47:32.250 --> 47:34.916
I completed this mission very carefully.

47:34.958 --> 47:37.791
Aqua, nothing changed here so far.

47:37.791 --> 47:40.208
I assume we have to break the machine first.

47:40.250 --> 47:44.291
I think XB10-3 will take care of that after he eliminated the target.

47:44.291 --> 47:45.708
You can't do that!

47:45.708 --> 47:48.958
And what the fuck? Why XB10-3? Did you do that on purpose?

47:49.000 --> 47:52.125
Do you wanna piss me off? Have I ever done anything to any of you?

47:52.125 --> 47:55.375
We feel like you're gonna betray us, Aqua.

47:55.416 --> 47:57.125
You didn't kill the guy.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.625
Nothing changes here.

47:58.666 --> 48:00.458
The guarding units are getting closer.

48:00.916 --> 48:02.541
Leon must die.

48:02.541 --> 48:03.458
No, he doesn't.

48:03.500 --> 48:07.625
He is on our side. I would have soon made his machine
unusuable together with him anyway.

48:07.666 --> 48:09.416
We have a different impression here, Aqua.

48:09.416 --> 48:11.583
You fucking cunt!

48:11.583 --> 48:14.958
Wow, the middle ages got into you.

48:14.958 --> 48:19.166
Sending someone after me to kill him, even though I told you
a thousand times that you didn't have to do this

48:19.208 --> 48:23.416
an entire day before my deadline - That's shitty enough.
But my fucking ex-boyfriend?

48:23.416 --> 48:25.166
That's an obvious bitchmove!

48:25.166 --> 48:27.708
I don't deserve your insinuations.

48:27.708 --> 48:30.250
We have sent our best man.

48:30.291 --> 48:32.583
Besides, he volunteered.

48:32.625 --> 48:35.125
Of course he did. Whoa I hate you all!

48:35.125 --> 48:36.916
I should let you all perish.

48:36.916 --> 48:42.000
If XB10-3 kills Leon, I'm just gonna upload myself into his
machine to make sure that you look as stupid as you do now.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.791
Aqua, calm dawn.

48:43.791 --> 48:46.083
I don't have time for you, you stupid whore.

52:40.333 --> 52:44.208
Leon, open the door. It's important.

53:20.208 --> 53:22.250
Are you Leon Jonas?

53:22.291 --> 53:23.583
Yes.

53:23.625 --> 53:27.916
You're responsible for the desolate status of earth, 100 years from now,

53:27.916 --> 53:31.291
to prevent that from happening I need to shoot you.

53:31.416 --> 53:34.291
Uhmm... I thought Aqua was already here for that.

53:34.333 --> 53:36.666
She obviously didn't complete her mission.

53:36.708 --> 53:39.083
Well... I don't know.

53:39.125 --> 53:42.458
By now, I'm not sure if I still want to do the whole
uploading thing and all.

53:42.458 --> 53:44.916
I don't care what you want to do or what you don't want to do.

53:44.916 --> 53:47.166
Nothing has changed in the future.

53:47.208 --> 53:49.708
Killing you is in evitable.

53:49.791 --> 53:51.750
Have you spoken to Aqua about this?

53:51.750 --> 53:54.041
I don't think she'd approve.

53:54.083 --> 53:55.625
I don't care about that either.

53:55.666 --> 53:58.000
Hey, why are you so pissed off?

53:58.041 --> 53:59.250
I'm not pissed off.

53:59.375 --> 54:02.583
Sure, you are! Just listen to yourself!

54:03.625 --> 54:04.500
What's your name?

54:04.833 --> 54:06.250
How is this relevant?

54:06.583 --> 54:09.833
Well, I think I have a right to know the name of my murderer.

54:10.208 --> 54:12.458
My name is XB10-3.

54:12.791 --> 54:14.250
What a romantic name.

54:14.458 --> 54:16.208
Where does it come from? What does it mean?

54:16.458 --> 54:19.000
As new bodies are assigned you get new names.

54:19.166 --> 54:21.666
Those are not actual names but rather serial numbers.

54:22.000 --> 54:23.125
You are a robot?

54:23.458 --> 54:24.333
That's correct.

54:24.541 --> 54:26.708
But I thought you guys didn't like robots.

54:27.125 --> 54:29.416
I left the guarding units and joined the rebellion.

54:31.375 --> 54:32.333
Why?

54:34.208 --> 54:35.500
Well...

54:38.708 --> 54:41.875
Back then I've never really thought about it.

54:43.500 --> 54:47.083
My digitalization was 50 years ago.

54:47.416 --> 54:50.041
Which means for you 50 years from now in the future.

54:50.750 --> 54:53.416
The digitalization was technical standard then.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.333
But it was not required for healthy people yet.

54:59.333 --> 55:00.333
You know, Leon...

55:02.208 --> 55:04.375
I was once very ill myself.

55:05.208 --> 55:06.500
Terminally ill...

55:07.791 --> 55:11.666
My doctor said; "Well, Mr Krautmann

55:12.208 --> 55:14.416
It's time for your digitalization.

55:14.458 --> 55:16.125
Your body won't make for too long now."

55:17.458 --> 55:19.750
So I let them digitalize me.

55:20.250 --> 55:23.083
And I joined their ranks with my new, ripped body.

55:23.791 --> 55:25.500
Just obeyed and cooperated.

55:26.958 --> 55:29.083
And suddenly I found myself as a guarding unit.

55:29.916 --> 55:31.458
Turbulent times...

55:31.875 --> 55:33.291
Went by without us noticing.

55:33.875 --> 55:36.875
And I thought all this time that I owed something to them.

55:37.041 --> 55:38.958
I mean they gave me this body.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.666
Otherwise I'd be dead now.

55:42.750 --> 55:46.791
Until I finally realized, that simply everything just went
by without me noticing,

55:46.833 --> 55:48.791
not just time.

55:49.166 --> 55:52.541
So I decided to join the revolution.

55:53.125 --> 55:54.291
I wanted to help.

55:55.833 --> 55:58.541
The thought that they wanted to get rid of bodies for good,

55:58.541 --> 56:01.166
that there would be no more real people,

56:01.166 --> 56:02.541
made me sick.

56:04.458 --> 56:06.125
Beer, hmm?

56:07.500 --> 56:08.958
No, thanks.

56:09.416 --> 56:10.750
Alcohol is wasted on me.

56:12.125 --> 56:13.750
This is an old model.

56:13.791 --> 56:16.250
It can't get drunk.

56:17.333 --> 56:18.958
I'm sorry to hear that.

56:23.375 --> 56:25.375
So, what happened between you and Aqua?

56:25.416 --> 56:26.916
Hm? What?

56:28.208 --> 56:30.125
Well, you were dating, right?

56:30.208 --> 56:33.000
How did you get that idea?

56:34.166 --> 56:37.458
You are pretty transparent.

56:37.916 --> 56:41.041
We were a couple for several years.

56:41.291 --> 56:42.333
Really?

56:43.208 --> 56:46.958
It hasn't been that long since we broke up.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.833
Well, since she broke up with me.

56:48.875 --> 56:51.041
I didn't agree.

56:51.166 --> 56:55.916
But those things are hard to understand, if you are digital.

56:56.916 --> 56:59.083
I enjoyed being with her.

57:00.583 --> 57:03.125
Why did she break up with you?

57:03.583 --> 57:05.875
Because the fizz was gone.

57:06.041 --> 57:09.500
Because I was too emotionless.

57:09.625 --> 57:11.833
And too sad.

57:13.625 --> 57:15.916
Did she say it like that?

57:16.000 --> 57:18.833
Similar, just with different words.

57:19.000 --> 57:21.000
And she was angry somehow.

57:22.500 --> 57:24.708
I didn't understand that.

57:25.250 --> 57:28.416
Oh dear...

57:28.708 --> 57:30.916
I'm sorry for that.

57:33.125 --> 57:38.666
You know... I know that you're dating Aqua now.

57:39.500 --> 57:41.583
And that's okay.

57:43.750 --> 57:46.250
As I said,

57:46.875 --> 57:49.208
your feelings are not too strong

57:49.291 --> 57:52.500
or clear if you are digital.

57:52.708 --> 57:55.250
I want you to know that, okay?

57:55.333 --> 57:59.333
Don't think that I'm going to shoot you because I don't like you

57:59.375 --> 58:01.208
or because you're dating Aqua.

58:02.416 --> 58:03.791
Ok?

58:06.625 --> 58:08.291
Uhmm, you want to shoot me now?

58:08.875 --> 58:09.916
Yes.

58:09.958 --> 58:12.208
Now? Right now?

58:12.291 --> 58:13.291
Yes.

58:13.583 --> 58:15.000
In this moment?

58:15.083 --> 58:17.583
Any last words?

58:23.250 --> 58:25.250
Can you hold this for me?

59:27.625 --> 59:29.208
Hold on!

59:32.291 --> 59:33.916
Put the gun down!

59:34.291 --> 59:35.666
I don't want to hurt you.

59:35.791 --> 59:37.625
Just let me do my job.

59:37.708 --> 59:40.583
Leon is my job and I was just about to complete it.

59:40.583 --> 59:41.833
"Just about to complete it."

59:41.833 --> 59:44.125
Nothing changed in the future.

59:44.208 --> 59:47.666
It was going to work out. You just had to trust me.

59:47.791 --> 59:50.708
I don't have time for this bullshit, sweetheart.

01:00:30.041 --> 01:00:33.083
Why you of all people? I said I needed some space.

01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:34.958
There is still a lot that we need to talk about.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.333
No, there isn't!

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:38.708
I disagree with the breakup.

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.250
Because of the foggy, artificial feelings.

01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:43.541
I can't be with a depressed robot anymore.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.750
Go ahead. Do it.

01:01:09.791 --> 01:01:11.875
I'm dead already.

01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:14.500
But don't get distracted. You have an important mission.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.791
I know that. You shouldn't have come here.
I can do it myself.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.500
I hope you--

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:22.708
What the hell?

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:24.291
You just shot him!

01:01:24.458 --> 01:01:26.416
That's not so bad. He was a robot and my ex.

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.791
Really not much of a loss.

01:01:27.958 --> 01:01:29.583
What kind of person are you?

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.250
Hello? He wanted to shoot you.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:33.916
I just saved your life. Be more grateful.

01:01:33.958 --> 01:01:35.666
But I'm just a job for you.

01:01:35.666 --> 01:01:37.041
And you are about to complete it?

01:01:37.416 --> 01:01:41.666
Well, it was an unfortunate wording but they sent him,
because they were losing patience.

01:01:41.666 --> 01:01:43.208
Because I don't want to shoot you.

01:01:43.208 --> 01:01:46.041
So are you manipulating me to give up instead?

01:01:46.083 --> 01:01:48.083
Manipulation is a strong word.

01:01:48.291 --> 01:01:50.416
But I'm just a job for you, right?

01:01:50.458 --> 01:01:54.250
During the whole time we have spent together,
everything has been just a fucking job for you!!!

01:01:54.291 --> 01:01:58.125
No, it's more than that but I happen to be here to save the world,

01:01:58.125 --> 01:01:59.666
not to find a boyfriend!

01:01:59.666 --> 01:02:02.583
But it didn't feel like that. Not for me.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:04.791
I thought it was about me.

01:02:04.833 --> 01:02:07.375
Stupid Leon! Such an idiot!

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:10.625
Who cares if he's gonna snuff it?

01:02:10.666 --> 01:02:13.125
What makes him so much worse than you?

01:02:13.125 --> 01:02:16.458
He wanted me dead. You want want me dead.
Everyone wants me dead!

01:02:16.458 --> 01:02:19.125
I don't want you dead! It sucks that you have to die.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:20.375
But you're gonna die!

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.750
That's my decision!

01:02:21.791 --> 01:02:23.041
No, it's not!

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:53.416
I know why still nothing has changed in the future.

01:02:53.458 --> 01:02:57.750
Because you ruined everything with your fucking,
dumb move you assholes!

01:02:57.791 --> 01:03:01.708
Calm dawn, I'm pretty sure no mistakes have been made on our side.

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:02.750
Fuck you!

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:05.750
The encounter with XB10-3 has thrown him over completely!

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:07.750
I have no idea, if he is gonna do it now after all this.

01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:09.958
How can he still do anything?

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:11.750
Didn't XB10-3 kill him?

01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:13.541
Of course not. Are you retarded?

01:03:13.541 --> 01:03:15.791
Like XB10-3 could stand a chance against me.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:17.250
What happened?

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:20.625
I shot him! What did you think would happen?

01:03:20.666 --> 01:03:22.500
I am speechless.

01:03:22.541 --> 01:03:25.333
Are you even aware of yourself?

01:03:25.333 --> 01:03:27.041
Are you completely nuts?

01:03:27.083 --> 01:03:28.833
I told you not to kill him.

01:03:28.833 --> 01:03:33.000
That I was gonna manage it somehow and
you idiots sent XB10-3 and ruined everything!

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.458
You know what? Just stay where you are!

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.500
Stay in the rose-colored past!

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.791
You are not welcome here anymore, Aqua!

01:03:39.791 --> 01:03:43.958
You lead us all to disaster with your fucking, egomaniacal behavior!

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:16.500
Howdy booty.

01:04:51.083 --> 01:04:55.083
Whoa, another one.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:58.083
Look, I'll give up on this damn machine, if all of you just leave me alone.

01:04:58.166 --> 01:05:00.166
Unfortunately I can not accept that.

01:05:00.166 --> 01:05:02.083
Show me the machine, now!

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.666
Okay.

01:05:24.541 --> 01:05:26.333
That?

01:05:26.333 --> 01:05:27.708
Yeah, that.

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.291
And now?

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.666
You will now get connected to the machine and digitalize yourself.

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:32.333
Excuse me?

01:05:32.333 --> 01:05:34.291
We can't take any chances.

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:39.041
That irresponsible bunch of rebels will cause serious damage.

01:05:39.041 --> 01:05:41.916
You know what happens, if you don't digitalize yourself today?

01:05:41.958 --> 01:05:42.916
I don't understand.

01:05:42.916 --> 01:05:45.833
Millions will die, will never be born.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:49.250
The entire world population of my time period will be gone.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.250
A whole world will be destroyed.

01:05:52.250 --> 01:05:56.458
Those selfish idiots didn't even care to give any thought to that.

01:05:56.458 --> 01:05:59.000
Time travel has consequences.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.083
You don't want to shoot me?

01:06:01.083 --> 01:06:05.958
I could change my mind, if you don't connect yourself
to the machine immediately.

01:06:05.958 --> 01:06:08.041
Is the machine operative?

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:09.833
Yes, I think so.

01:06:09.833 --> 01:06:12.458
Untested, but it's theoretically operative.

01:06:12.458 --> 01:06:14.458
Works for me. Move it!

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:52.208
Hold on!

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:53.041
You?

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:54.041
You!

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:57.208
Excuse me, what is this?

01:07:57.208 --> 01:08:00.041
You've just met my mom. She works for the government.

01:08:00.041 --> 01:08:01.250
That's your mom?!

01:08:01.291 --> 01:08:04.625
It's not her real body! She is a miserable traitor!

01:08:04.625 --> 01:08:07.041
Have some respect, when you talk to your mother.

01:08:07.041 --> 01:08:08.375
Fuck you!

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:11.833
Just as immature as this whole pseudo-political movement.

01:08:12.291 --> 01:08:14.625
I'm not talking to you. You've killed dad!

01:08:14.625 --> 01:08:16.375
I've given him eternal life.

01:08:16.375 --> 01:08:19.832
You murdered him and put him in this awful computer program.

01:08:19.832 --> 01:08:21.125
He never wanted to go there!

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:24.375
You all have a childishly distorted idea of 'Paradise 2'.

01:08:24.375 --> 01:08:30.332
You're ready to obliterate all people alive in our time,
just to avoid living forever in paradise?

01:08:30.332 --> 01:08:31.500
Yes.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.832
That's madness! You're a fanatic terrorist!

01:08:34.832 --> 01:08:36.916
And you're a filthy traitor!

01:08:36.916 --> 01:08:38.666
I don't have time for this nonsense.

01:08:44.082 --> 01:08:46.332
Shooting will not be tolerated here. You could damage the machine.

01:08:58.625 --> 01:09:00.832
I wish I wouldn't have to do this.

01:09:42.082 --> 01:09:44.541
It's time to end this bullshit once and for all.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:46.666
Right!
