00:01.669 --> 00:03.570
Previously
 on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...
Let's delve into your childhood.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.339
Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.641
I used to like her.
 You still do.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.443
I don't want to be
your back-up plan.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.179
I am bi-sexual!

00:11.212 --> 00:13.514
I'm going for drinks
 with this gay man

00:13.547 --> 00:14.615
whom I have a crush on.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.717
This could be the biggest case
the county's ever seen.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.653
I must find in favor of the
defendants-- Greater City Water.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.255
I'm from the metro
desk at the paper.

00:21.289 --> 00:22.390
This should help
get you started.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.457
These are e-mails that clearly

00:23.491 --> 00:24.425
expose a cover-up.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.260
You tried really hard today.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.695
I wanted you to
be proud of me.

00:27.728 --> 00:30.531
I didn't know
you thought about me that much.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.536
* I was working hard
at a New York job *

00:35.569 --> 00:37.371
* Making dough
but it made me blue *

00:37.405 --> 00:38.839
* One day I was crying a lot

00:38.872 --> 00:40.274
* And so I decided to move

00:40.308 --> 00:41.742
* To West Covina, California

00:41.775 --> 00:43.244
* Brand-new pals
and new career *

00:43.277 --> 00:45.513
* It happens to be
where Josh lives *

00:45.546 --> 00:48.082
* But that's not why I'm here

00:48.116 --> 00:50.218
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *
What? No, I'm not.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.685
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:51.719 --> 00:52.686
That's a sexist term.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.455
* She's the crazy
 ex-girlfriend *

00:54.488 --> 00:55.523
Can you guys stop singing
for just a second?

00:55.556 --> 00:58.326
* She's so broken inside *

00:58.359 --> 00:59.627
The situation's a lot more
nuanced than that.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.695
* C-R-A-Z-Y *

01:01.729 --> 01:03.331
Okay! We get it!

01:03.364 --> 01:05.699
* Crazy ex-girlfriend. *

01:05.733 --> 01:07.735
*

01:14.775 --> 01:15.843
(sighs)

01:17.645 --> 01:18.779
(sighs deeply)

01:24.252 --> 01:25.586
(laughs)

01:25.619 --> 01:28.622
(giggles)

01:28.656 --> 01:31.592
(mutters quietly)

01:31.625 --> 01:33.327
(sniffles)
Okay...

01:37.565 --> 01:39.567
What happened?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.875
Dude, bro, what happened?

01:47.908 --> 01:50.644
God, it was such
a magical kiss.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.281
Oh, my gosh, it transported
me to a different world,

01:53.314 --> 01:56.584
like where they shoot the
fun parts of Game of Thrones.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.752
Okay, so, so why are you at
my house? I mean, I watched it

01:58.786 --> 01:59.820
happen, and I took off,
'cause I figured

01:59.853 --> 02:01.855
you two would be having
stand-up sex in the shower

02:01.889 --> 02:03.357
of a very nice
bed-and-breakfast by now.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.492
I don't... I don't know.

02:04.525 --> 02:07.895
Uh, he just bailed.
He said he had to go somewhere.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.663
I don't know where he is
or what he's thinking.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.631
JOSH:
 After the kiss, I just bailed.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.366
I'm riddled
with guilt.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.701
It's killing me!

02:13.734 --> 02:15.703
I'm in a committed
relationship, FB.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.771
I live with Valencia.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.807
What do I do?

02:19.840 --> 02:22.210
Bro, do you remember,
in the second grade,

02:22.243 --> 02:24.545
when we had that
class bunny, Carrots?

02:24.578 --> 02:26.780
Um... yeah?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.817
Okay, yeah, well, when it was
my week to take care of her,

02:29.850 --> 02:32.753
I, um... I accidentally
dropped her in the toilet.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.489
And, uh, I freaked out so much
that I panicked,

02:35.523 --> 02:38.492
and then, I flushed.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.693
But, uh, you know,

02:39.727 --> 02:41.295
her baby bunny body

02:41.329 --> 02:42.930
just clogged that toilet up.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.199
Um, and then,
here comes my dad

02:45.233 --> 02:47.201
with the plunger,
and then up comes the corpse.

02:47.235 --> 02:48.702
(sighs)
So, I told everybody

02:48.736 --> 02:49.603
that my brother Eric did it.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.272
He was only four years old,
you know,

02:51.305 --> 02:52.740
so, like, everybody believed me.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.642
It was so easy. It...

02:54.675 --> 02:55.676
It was the perfect crime.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.345
Yeah.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.747
I blamed my baby brother
for that baby bunny body.

03:00.748 --> 03:01.749
(snickering)

03:03.617 --> 03:06.754
Dude, are you
stoned right now?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.323
(sniffles, sighs)

03:09.357 --> 03:10.358
Yeah.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.426
Oh, bro...

03:12.460 --> 03:13.694
I got a bad back.
It's awesome.
(sighs)

03:13.727 --> 03:15.629
Listen, Josh, would you
just focus for a second?

03:15.663 --> 03:18.732
I was consumed by guilt
for years because

03:18.766 --> 03:20.968
that was the first step
in my baby brother becoming,

03:21.001 --> 03:22.870
like, a hardcore
heroin addict, you know?

03:22.903 --> 03:24.872
And then one day,
I realized

03:24.905 --> 03:27.441
I had to ask for forgiveness.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.678
And that was hard...

03:30.711 --> 03:34.248
because that cult was
on an island.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.650
But I did it, I found him,
and I confessed,

03:36.684 --> 03:39.953
and much like the Madonna--

03:39.987 --> 03:42.456
he forgave me.

03:42.490 --> 03:44.825
And that's why
I'm a priest, man.

03:46.694 --> 03:50.298
Go to the person you have
wronged, my son, my brah.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.701
Perhaps they will forgive.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.704
Dude, we're talking
about Valencia.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.706
Mm... Yeah, you're screwed.

03:58.739 --> 04:00.441
Sorry.

04:03.076 --> 04:06.347
We have to celebrate.
Your first kiss!

04:06.380 --> 04:07.715
I think I have...

04:07.748 --> 04:10.784
sparkling apple cider
somewh-- aha!

04:10.818 --> 04:14.388
Expires... 2012.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.690
Perfect. Should be
alcohol by now.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.559
(laughter)
This...

04:18.591 --> 04:20.761
is my favorite part
of a romantic comedy.

04:20.793 --> 04:25.633
It's like you're Kate Hudson,
and Josh is this British actor

04:25.666 --> 04:28.602
that, like, no one's ever
heard of, but is super cute,

04:28.636 --> 04:31.405
and Valencia is the skinny bitch

04:31.439 --> 04:33.541
who ends up getting
just what she deserves.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.676
I kind of saw it
as a fairy tale

04:35.709 --> 04:36.910
where I'm the spunky princess,

04:36.944 --> 04:39.680
Josh is the handsome prince
who gets turned into a stone,

04:39.713 --> 04:42.716
and Valencia is the witch
who turned him into that stone.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.018
You have put a lot of thought
into this narrative.
I have.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.887
(ringtone plays)
Hmm. Oh!

04:46.920 --> 04:49.390
Crap. Hold on.

04:49.423 --> 04:52.426
Hi, Dr. Akopian.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.762
Okay, yes, I'm aware we
have an appointment tonight,

04:54.795 --> 04:57.365
and I have to cancel.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.099
I know there's a
cancellation fee.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.369
I will pay it,
I will reschedule.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.471
I'm so sorry. Bye.
Have a good night.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.872
Ew. I feel bad.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.340
I keep cancelling
with my shrink.

05:06.374 --> 05:07.841
I just don't have any time.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.577
God knows why you have a shrink
in the first place

05:09.610 --> 05:11.579
when you have me.
I give such great advice.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.747
Now let's drink
this old expired apple juice.

05:13.781 --> 05:15.115
(inhales, exhales)

05:15.148 --> 05:17.685
Paula, it's weird;
I haven't heard

05:17.718 --> 05:18.819
anything from Josh.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.020
Maybe I'll call him just once,

05:20.053 --> 05:21.489
or, like, send him,
like, a flirty text.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.525
No. No. Oh, God, God, no.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.394
Have you never seen
a two-and-half star movie?

05:26.427 --> 05:28.962
Right now,
he has to come to you.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.964
The most important thing
is that you don't call,

05:30.998 --> 05:34.902
you don't e-mail,
you don't reach out in any way.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.804
Okay, fine.

05:36.837 --> 05:40.508
I have a lot of work
to do anyway.
Good. Cheers.

05:42.009 --> 05:42.843
(sighs)

05:42.876 --> 05:45.746
REBECCA:
 "Client agrees to keep the land

05:45.779 --> 05:47.981
in accordance
 with all policy..."

05:48.015 --> 05:49.149
Bored!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.584
Oh, boy.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.919
This is a dilemma.

05:51.952 --> 05:54.422
Josh loves red pandas
 so much, and this one...

05:54.455 --> 05:56.690
I mean, if I don't send it,
 it's almost mean.

05:56.724 --> 05:57.858
You know, I think even

05:57.891 --> 05:59.760
Paula would understand.
 I have to send this to him.

05:59.793 --> 06:01.495
Oh, what am I talking about?
 I shouldn't.

06:01.529 --> 06:02.530
He's probably already seen it!

06:02.563 --> 06:03.697
Because everyone knows
 he likes red pandas.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.935
You know, and he's probably
 gotten this photo a lot.

06:07.968 --> 06:09.470
Aah! What if he hasn't?

06:09.503 --> 06:10.904
Oh, and it's the cutest one.

06:10.938 --> 06:13.441
Then I'm the jerk.
 Then it's on me.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.509
Maybe I'll print it out
 and mail it anonymously?

06:15.543 --> 06:16.944
I gotta stop. I gotta stop.

06:16.977 --> 06:17.978
I have to think
 about something besides...

06:18.011 --> 06:19.413
(knocking on door)
JOSH: Rebecca?

06:19.447 --> 06:20.648
It's Josh!

06:20.681 --> 06:23.951
Oh, my God, it worked.

06:23.984 --> 06:25.653
I'm coming! I'm coming!

06:25.686 --> 06:26.754
Yup!

06:30.591 --> 06:32.059
Do you have a minute?

06:32.092 --> 06:33.594
(sighs)

06:37.998 --> 06:39.900
I feel overdressed.
(laughs)

06:39.933 --> 06:41.902
(laughs)

06:41.935 --> 06:44.872
Those pajamas are cute.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.007
I like the little sushi on 'em.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.008
Oh. (laughs)

06:48.041 --> 06:50.644
Arigato.

06:50.678 --> 06:51.879
Oh. (laughs)

06:51.912 --> 06:54.147
It's... (laughs)

06:54.181 --> 06:58.185
Oh... So, look, uh, we have
to talk about that kiss.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.120
Yes, yes. Yes, we do.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.955
I... (sighs)

07:01.989 --> 07:04.124
Yes.
I...

07:05.959 --> 07:07.595
...can't stop thinking about it.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.997
Me, neither.
I mean, it was...

07:10.030 --> 07:11.565
Yeah, no. It-it was.

07:11.599 --> 07:14.568
Rebecca, I feel something
for you.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.070
Oh, my God, yes, yes. Wow.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.473
We obviously have
some kind of connection.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.042
No, we absolutely have a
connection, Josh, and I feel...

07:22.075 --> 07:23.511
Aah! I feel so many things.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.078
But kissing you was wrong.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.915
Sorry. What?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.584
I have a girlfriend,
you have a boyfriend.

07:30.618 --> 07:33.521
Who? Oh, uh, no.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.055
No, no, no, no, no.
We-we broke up.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.924
Wait. Trent? Tonight?
Because of me?

07:36.957 --> 07:40.060
No. He's tall. He...
It doesn't matter. He's dead.

07:40.093 --> 07:41.962
Just don't think about him.
Keep talking.

07:41.995 --> 07:44.031
But I-I shouldn't
have cheated. I...

07:44.064 --> 07:46.099
Now there's only
one thing to do.

07:46.133 --> 07:48.836
Follow your heart...?

07:48.869 --> 07:49.970
I have to tell Valencia.

07:50.003 --> 07:53.006
And if I tell her,
she's definitely

07:53.040 --> 07:55.108
gonna break up with me,
like, definitely.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.110
She will?

07:57.144 --> 08:02.215
Our kiss will end
everything between me and V.

08:02.249 --> 08:05.719
Well, uh, that's, uh...

08:05.753 --> 08:08.021
You know, that's terribly sad.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.058
Telling her is the
right thing to do.

08:11.091 --> 08:14.862
Even if it means ending
the relationship.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.864
Wow.

08:16.897 --> 08:20.901
So, uh, so then...
so then, what happens?

08:20.934 --> 08:22.169
Oh, well, then I go to Hawaii.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.271
What?
Hector's

08:24.304 --> 08:27.074
in a surf competition,
and some of us are coming along.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.976
Oh, thank God.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.211
The drama happens,
then I get to just

08:31.244 --> 08:35.082
get away for a while, hop on
flight 425 to Maui on Thursday.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.017
Then I'll be
in Hawaii just

08:37.049 --> 08:41.221
watching the sunset,
wondering about the future.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.155
Right, um...

08:43.190 --> 08:45.926
your future.

08:45.959 --> 08:48.996
I'm sorry, Rebecca.
(groans)

08:49.029 --> 08:52.633
I, I-I shouldn't have done
what I did, any of it.

08:52.666 --> 08:55.002
I shouldn't have grabbed you,

08:55.035 --> 08:57.037
or squeezed you, or...

08:57.070 --> 08:59.607
put my hand on the
nape of your neck,

08:59.640 --> 09:02.610
or run it through
your hair.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.113
What else?
What else did you do?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.149
I-I have to go.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.853
(groans)

09:15.388 --> 09:17.157
(sighs)

09:17.190 --> 09:19.059
What happens next?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.729
What happens next
in-in your stupid movies?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.897
Uh, I think it's obvious.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.635
You go bikini shopping
and try on floppy hats.

09:27.668 --> 09:28.969
Why?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.304
Because you're going
to Hawaii, you idiot!

09:31.338 --> 09:33.674
Ladies, hey,
you two chatty Cathys.

09:33.707 --> 09:34.975
It's time for the staff meeting.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.076
Okay, hold on, Darryl.
Darryl...

09:36.109 --> 09:39.079
God. Rebecca, listen,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.881
you are at
the grand gesture moment.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.750
It is the best part
of any rom com.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.017
Okay, it's the...
it's the...

09:44.051 --> 09:45.753
get up on stage
and sing the song,

09:45.786 --> 09:47.087
and-and run through the rain

09:47.120 --> 09:48.321
and show up
and object at the wedding,

09:48.355 --> 09:50.123
and-and... and race
to the airport

09:50.157 --> 09:51.692
before he leaves for Kazakhstan.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.860
Wait. No, he's
going to Hawaii.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.862
Rebecca, go to your office,

09:54.895 --> 09:57.364
get a ticket
on that flight right now.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.400
I don't know-- are you
sure this is a good idea?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.969
Yes, I know these things.

10:02.002 --> 10:05.205
I am your funny best friend
with all the answers, okay?

10:05.238 --> 10:07.975
I'm your Judy Greer, your
Rosie O'Donnell, your-your...

10:08.008 --> 10:10.210
(gasps)
your Joan Cusack.
You know what?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.012
In my narrative,
I'd picture you

10:12.045 --> 10:13.180
as, like, the funny
singing raccoon.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.215
Of course you did.
That's not an insult.

10:15.248 --> 10:17.751
You have the breakout
song of the whole movie.
Just go get the ticket!

10:17.785 --> 10:20.120
Okay, I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it!
(both laughing)

10:20.153 --> 10:22.155
You know what?
As the kids say,

10:22.189 --> 10:24.024
I'm gonna YOLO before I FOMO.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.359
Is that yogurt?
What is that?
I saw it on a meme.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.160
I have no idea what that...

10:27.194 --> 10:28.395
Nor do I care.
Go get the ticket.

10:39.472 --> 10:42.042
(exhaling deeply)

10:43.410 --> 10:44.411
Hi, honey.

10:44.444 --> 10:46.079
Nothing's wrong. What?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.948
(sighs) You've been acting
all weird today.

10:47.981 --> 10:48.949
What's wrong?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.251
I-I-I don't know

10:51.284 --> 10:52.853
what you're talking about.
(scoffs)

10:52.886 --> 10:54.187
You already worked out
this morning,

10:54.221 --> 10:56.156
and now you're going
to the gym again?

10:56.189 --> 10:58.391
A man can't go to CrossFit
for six hours?

10:58.425 --> 10:59.927
Big things are happening there.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.228
We're doing the Murph today.

11:01.261 --> 11:02.863
Okay.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.332
(sighs)

11:06.834 --> 11:09.269
Actually, um,

11:09.302 --> 11:10.403
there is something I wanted

11:10.437 --> 11:12.305
to talk to you about.
Maybe we should...

11:12.339 --> 11:14.307
talk after your evening class.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.976
Oh, honey,
I'm gonna be late tonight.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.377
I'm doing
that cryotherapy thing.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.912
We'll talk
about it tomorrow, then.

11:18.946 --> 11:19.913
That's even better. Good!

11:19.947 --> 11:20.914
That's even better. Good!

11:20.948 --> 11:22.816
No kiss?
(door shuts)

11:22.850 --> 11:24.351
Hmm.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.754
(gasps)
I wonder what's going on.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.156
(squeals)

11:30.357 --> 11:32.459
Okay, people...

11:32.492 --> 11:34.127
no beating around the bush.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.263
Let's get to why we're here.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.365
Um, hi, everyone.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.500
Uh, since this is
my first staff meeting,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.836
I thought I'd give everybody
a big hello.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.171
My name is Maya.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.473
I'm the new
administrative assistant.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.075
And a little about me--

11:48.108 --> 11:51.111
um, I love online shopping
and kale salads and...

11:51.144 --> 11:53.113
Maya, this is not the time.

11:53.146 --> 11:54.381
This is not about you.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.415
Okay?

11:55.448 --> 11:56.449
Please.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.218
Is everybody onboard? Great.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.520
I want you all to listen
really hard now.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.055
I mean, really listen.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.090
Like, with both your ears.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.424
Okay, Darryl, spit it out.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.893
Okay, well,
I'm sure you've noticed

12:05.926 --> 12:07.194
that I've been going
through a lot lately.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.962
And I know
you've often wondered:

12:08.996 --> 12:11.364
"Who is Darryl, really?"

12:11.398 --> 12:12.165
Nope, never.

12:12.199 --> 12:13.166
Darryl, until February,

12:13.200 --> 12:14.234
I thought your name was Jasper.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.807
Okay, pre-purchase Wi-Fi
to save seven dollars, yes.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.474
Dietary restrictions.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.343
You betcha.

12:29.382 --> 12:30.818
DARRYL:
 You know,

12:30.851 --> 12:33.020
there are times when I look
out these windows,

12:33.053 --> 12:34.354
and I know you're all thinking,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.356
"What makes the measure
of this man?"

12:36.389 --> 12:38.358
Oh, my God,
you'd better be dying!

12:38.391 --> 12:40.828
Look, I called you all here

12:40.861 --> 12:43.030
to tell you,

12:43.063 --> 12:45.933
with pride and excitement...

12:45.966 --> 12:47.434
and a lot of pride,

12:47.467 --> 12:50.503
about the new and improved
Darryl C. Whitefeather.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.505
Jim, give me a beat.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.574
Sorry, what?

12:54.607 --> 12:56.409
When somebody asks for a beat
you just, you don't ask

12:56.443 --> 12:57.677
a lot of questions.
You just get down on it.

12:57.710 --> 13:00.413
Oh, you want, like, a syncopated
thing or, like, a vibey thing?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.149
Just do it. Hmm?

13:05.485 --> 13:07.487
('80s pop rock song plays)

13:12.325 --> 13:13.827
* I don't know how

13:13.861 --> 13:15.462
* I don't know why

13:15.495 --> 13:17.330
* But I like ladies

13:17.364 --> 13:18.598
* And I like guys

13:18.631 --> 13:20.467
* I realize

13:20.500 --> 13:22.602
* It's a surprise

13:22.635 --> 13:24.571
* But now I see that
that's just me *

13:24.604 --> 13:26.473
* It's not like I even try

13:26.506 --> 13:30.110
* So if you ask me
how I'm doing *

13:30.143 --> 13:32.079
* Here is my reply

13:32.112 --> 13:33.947
* I'm g-g-g-g-gettin' bi

13:33.981 --> 13:36.483
* I'm getting bi

13:36.516 --> 13:39.186
* Oh, yeah,
I'm lettin' my bi flag fly *

13:39.219 --> 13:41.488
* Not gonna hide it

13:41.521 --> 13:42.956
* Not gonna lie

13:42.990 --> 13:45.192
* I'm a bi kind of guy

13:45.225 --> 13:47.060
* There's no reason
to be shy *

13:47.094 --> 13:48.528
* My, oh, my

13:48.561 --> 13:50.630
* It's a fact I can't deny

13:50.663 --> 13:53.833
* I'm bi, bi, bi,
until the day I die *

13:57.170 --> 13:58.571
* Now some may say

13:58.605 --> 14:00.240
* Are you just gay?

14:00.273 --> 14:03.276
* Why don't you just go gay
all the way? *

14:03.310 --> 14:05.578
* But that's not it

14:05.612 --> 14:06.947

14:09.049 --> 14:10.650
* We might be a perfect fit

14:10.683 --> 14:12.519
* And one more thing

14:12.552 --> 14:14.421
* I tell you what

14:14.454 --> 14:17.590
* Being bi does not imply
that you're a player or a slut *

14:17.624 --> 14:19.059
* Sure, I like sex

14:19.092 --> 14:20.193
Please make him stop.

14:21.328 --> 14:22.662
* But I'm no ho,
I take things slow *

14:22.695 --> 14:25.098
* Until I feel at ease

14:26.633 --> 14:29.636
* So if you ask me
how I'm doing *

14:29.669 --> 14:32.305
* I'm feeling peppy,
sprightly, spry *

14:32.339 --> 14:34.207
* I'm g-g-g-g-gettin' bi

14:34.241 --> 14:35.943
* I'm gettin' bi

14:35.976 --> 14:39.279
* And it's something
I'd like to demystify *

14:39.312 --> 14:41.581
* It's not a phase

14:41.614 --> 14:43.316
* I'm not confused

14:43.350 --> 14:44.584
* Not indecisive

14:44.617 --> 14:46.419
* I don't have
the gotta-choose blues *

14:46.453 --> 14:50.257
* I don't care if you wear
high heels or a tie *

14:50.290 --> 14:52.092
* You might just catch my eye

14:52.125 --> 14:53.927
* Because I'm definitely bi

14:53.961 --> 14:54.694
* Big man!

14:54.727 --> 14:57.164
(instrumental interlude)

15:02.202 --> 15:03.971
* I'm gettin' bi

15:04.004 --> 15:05.672
* I'm gettin' bi...

15:05.705 --> 15:07.474
* I'm gettin' bi

15:07.507 --> 15:09.209
* I'm gettin' bi...

15:09.242 --> 15:10.310
* I'm gettin' bi

15:10.343 --> 15:12.579
* I'm gettin' bi...

15:12.612 --> 15:14.581
* It doesn't take
an intellectual *

15:14.614 --> 15:16.516
* To get that I'm bisexual.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.057
(song ends)

15:24.091 --> 15:26.659
Any questions?

15:28.761 --> 15:30.730
Oh, come on.
You guys aren't weirded out

15:30.763 --> 15:32.365
because I'm bisexual, are you?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.467
No, we're weirded out
by the fact that our boss

15:34.501 --> 15:36.169
just called a meeting
to tell us that.

15:36.203 --> 15:36.703
MAYA:
Um...

15:36.736 --> 15:38.571
Hi, everyone, again.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.073
I know that this is

15:40.107 --> 15:41.975
a little personal
for my first week here,

15:42.009 --> 15:43.743
but I'm also bisexual,

15:43.776 --> 15:47.114
and I am so glad that
this office is so open...

15:47.147 --> 15:48.248
Does anyone else have
any other questions

15:48.281 --> 15:50.383
besides Maya, who seems
to think that every meeting

15:50.417 --> 15:52.252
is about her for some reason?

15:53.253 --> 15:54.387
Jim.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.455
Are you sure
you're not just gay?

15:55.488 --> 15:56.556
Oh, my God.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.724
Did you not hear what I said?

15:57.757 --> 15:59.292
Come on!

15:59.326 --> 16:01.561
Guys, this is important.

16:01.594 --> 16:02.762
Are there any other questions?

16:02.795 --> 16:03.763
JIM:
Whoa.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.764
This is weird.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.466
Hey, guys, look at this.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.369
I don't believe it.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.703
Bunch is some kind of hero.

16:10.737 --> 16:12.505
(laughing):
Oh, my God!

16:12.539 --> 16:13.406
This is perfect.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.210
Now she can lip-sync
on a parade float!

16:17.244 --> 16:19.346
So, we're moving on
from my stuff, then.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.381
Cool.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.488
(footsteps approaching)

16:28.521 --> 16:31.158
Wow, you are really having
the best day ever!

16:31.191 --> 16:32.792
You know that evidence you gave
to the reporter?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.760
It's touched off a landslide.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.295
Have you seen this?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.700
What's wrong?

16:40.733 --> 16:42.269
Um, okay, uh, what's wrong

16:42.302 --> 16:43.803
is I was trying to buy
the ticket for Hawaii,

16:43.836 --> 16:45.138
and so I tried

16:45.172 --> 16:46.206
all of my credit cards,

16:46.239 --> 16:47.407
and then I tried my debit card,

16:47.440 --> 16:48.275
and then I checked
my bank account--

16:48.308 --> 16:49.309
which according
to the welcome screen,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.412
I haven't done since 2011--
and now I'm seeing

16:52.445 --> 16:55.148
my balance, and, Paula,
guess what's in there. Guess.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.649
It's a negative number, Paula.
It's negative a lot.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.784
(sighs)

16:57.817 --> 16:59.452
Holy Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Paula.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.487
Am I broke?

17:11.830 --> 17:13.066
How could you be broke?

17:13.099 --> 17:14.300
You're rich.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.301
That's what I thought.

17:15.335 --> 17:17.369
Yo, Bunch.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.805
Guy from the Mayor's Office
is here for you.

17:18.838 --> 17:19.906
It's the mayor.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.808
He wants to give you the key
to the city or something.

17:21.840 --> 17:23.242
Uh, yeah, okay.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.411
I'll be right there.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.179
Okay.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.579
I don't understand this.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.316
How am I broke?
I can't be broke.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.750
I mean, all right, sure,
since I moved here,

17:30.783 --> 17:32.652
maybe I've spent a little money
here and there.

17:32.685 --> 17:33.853
So I got this treadmill desk.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.855
That was, like, $2,000 mistake?

17:35.888 --> 17:37.357
I pledge $1,000.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.858
And it's really fine.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.161
I-I-I got it.
MAN: Good thing
the drinks are free.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.097
Here you go.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.665
I'm gonna go to the bank,
withdraw $10,000

17:45.698 --> 17:48.401
and plant it
 in your wife's suitcase.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.504
Well, you had a huge salary
in New York.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.173
What about your savings?

17:53.206 --> 17:55.675
(groans)
I never worried about saving.

17:55.708 --> 17:58.111
You know what, I keep forgetting
that you are so smart

17:58.145 --> 17:59.779
and so not smart!

17:59.812 --> 18:01.181
I just never had to think
about money.

18:01.214 --> 18:02.782
You don't think about money.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.152
Wow, that must free up
some time.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.153
Paula?

18:06.186 --> 18:07.820
I can't go. There's no running
to Kazakhstan.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.657
Hawaii is out.
What?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.126
No. Okay, Rebecca, let me
explain something to you.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.594
You have a window,

18:14.627 --> 18:17.764
and that window is Hawaii!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.466
I can't afford to go
to Hawaii right now.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.368
I can't even afford
to buy a pack of Skittles!

18:21.401 --> 18:22.735
Okay, look,
I would give you the money,

18:22.769 --> 18:23.870
but I don't have any money.

18:23.903 --> 18:24.837
(knocking)
JIM: Rebecca.

18:24.871 --> 18:25.772
The mayor doesn't have all day.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.574
Or maybe he does.
Yeah, he probably does.

18:27.607 --> 18:28.908
But he's out here.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.677
(sighs)

18:32.945 --> 18:34.181
Here she is right now.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.482
Rebecca.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.918
You are an inspiration,
a model citizen,

18:38.951 --> 18:41.188
and we would be thrilled
to give you the key to the city.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.590
Oh, wow.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.892
That, what, that's great.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.560
Key to the city.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.429
Uh, question,
is there a cash prize

18:49.462 --> 18:50.863
associated with that?

18:50.897 --> 18:52.532
No.

18:52.565 --> 18:53.933
Sorry, okay.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.868
I don't know how things work.

18:57.304 --> 18:58.871
CHRIS: She's looking
sharp in that suit.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.874
It really highlights her brains
and tactical thinking skills.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.643
(sighs)
Is she still single?

19:03.676 --> 19:04.811
Who cares? Who knows?

19:04.844 --> 19:06.746
I don't even think
about that anymore.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.681
Why not?
Didn't you go all the way to LA

19:08.715 --> 19:09.882
just to tell her you dig her?

19:09.916 --> 19:11.284
Yes, I did, Chris.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.853
And it did not work out.

19:13.886 --> 19:16.589
'Cause life isn't
a two-and-a-half-star movie.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.924
I made a grand gesture,

19:17.957 --> 19:19.626
I made a fool out of myself,

19:19.659 --> 19:23.196
because that's what happens when
you emulate stupid rom coms.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.298
So you and Heather split up
for no reason?

19:25.332 --> 19:26.566
Ouch.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.968
And now you have to
work together?

19:29.001 --> 19:30.403
I might take my root beer to go.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.639
It's gonna be a bloodbath
when she shows up.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.940
What? No.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.242
There's not gonna be any drama.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.809
She broke up with me.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.745
Besides, Heather is chill,

19:38.778 --> 19:39.979
mature, tattooed.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.581
She's gonna be totally cool
about it.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.283
Hit the deck.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.818
Hey, dude.

19:46.819 --> 19:47.920
'Sup, girl?

19:47.954 --> 19:49.589
See?

19:49.622 --> 19:52.325
That's how two adults
handle the post-breakup.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.193
Watch and learn.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.730
Okay, Mom.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.266
Love you. Bye.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.668
What was that?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.470
I don't know if she's having
a stroke or something,

20:03.503 --> 20:05.972
but she said she saw
the articles about me online,

20:06.005 --> 20:08.007
and she loves me.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.008
(gasps)

20:09.041 --> 20:10.443
And she's proud of me.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.412
Oh!
And she's sending me
a present.

20:12.445 --> 20:13.546
(gasps) Yay.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.647
I mean,
it's probably rugelach.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.882
Gesundheit.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.016
Come on, you know
what rugelach is.
Nope.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.885
What?
No, what is it?

20:18.918 --> 20:20.453
It's amazing.
It's, like, a dessert.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.554
Oh, all right.
Anyway,

20:21.588 --> 20:23.290
I mean, she's not gonna
be proud of me

20:23.323 --> 20:24.624
now that I'm a pauper.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.493
Okay, you're gonna get
a paycheck next week, right?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.495
I get a paycheck next week?
Wait, for how much?

20:28.528 --> 20:29.962
You don't know how much
you earn?!

20:29.996 --> 20:31.498
I'm a lawyer, not an accountant.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.532
Oh...
MAYA:
Everyone.

20:32.565 --> 20:33.566
There's a car

20:33.600 --> 20:34.934
right outside the office,

20:34.967 --> 20:36.002
and it's being repossessed.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.470
They're towing it right now.

20:37.504 --> 20:38.938
Does anyone here own

20:38.971 --> 20:41.408
a 2015 Hyundai Sonata?

20:41.441 --> 20:42.041
No!

20:42.074 --> 20:43.042
Oh, my God!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.344
Oh, my God, I can't watch.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.612
I can't watch. I can't watch.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.280
My poor little Hyundai.

20:47.314 --> 20:49.282
Oh, my gosh, with its
roomy interior and sporty feel.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.216
Did you pay your lease?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.951
I mean, my lease is set
to autopay, but...

20:51.984 --> 20:52.952
You didn't pay your lease.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.587
You know what, unless you have
a time machine,

20:54.621 --> 20:55.588
comments like that
aren't helpful right now.

20:55.622 --> 20:56.923
What do I do?

20:56.956 --> 20:57.757
Uh, maybe I can sell the car.

20:57.790 --> 20:58.925
(stammering)

20:58.958 --> 20:59.926
Wait.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.561
What? Do I not own my car?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.496
Do I not own my car anymore?

21:03.530 --> 21:04.631
Paula?

21:04.664 --> 21:06.299
Paula?

21:06.333 --> 21:07.334
Paula? Paula?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.041
MAN:
 Miss? Miss?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.909
Miss, can you help me?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.911
I ordered a vodka
a while ago.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.580
Okay, well, you
made me lose count,

21:20.613 --> 21:23.049
so now I have to
start over. Thanks.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.584
Uh, I'll count
them for you.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.052
Just make me a drink?

21:26.085 --> 21:27.587
Hey.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.688
How's it going over here?

21:28.721 --> 21:30.357
I'm just touching
all the cherries.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.758
They feel like eyeballs.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.892
It's so slow
here today.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.894
I have, like,
nothing to do.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.896
This is nice.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.566
Us being cool,
working side-by-side.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.100
Yep.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.102
A lot of people would think
this would be awkward between us

21:43.135 --> 21:44.737
because we used to...

21:47.039 --> 21:48.541
You know what
we used to do.

21:48.575 --> 21:49.909
But it's totally fine.

21:49.942 --> 21:51.778
Oh, yeah.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.447
Besides, it's not like we were,
like, serious or anything.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.748
We were just having fun, right?

21:55.782 --> 21:57.384
Yeah.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.718
Yeah.

21:58.751 --> 21:59.919
So what happened
with you and Rebecca?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.921
Oh, it's...
(sighs)

22:01.954 --> 22:04.457
Didn't work out, but...

22:04.491 --> 22:06.025
Cool.

22:06.058 --> 22:08.695
Cool.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.630
Well, you'll get her someday.

22:11.998 --> 22:12.965
Rooting for you.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.000
Yeah.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.004
See? That wasn't awkward at all.

22:19.972 --> 22:21.841
Chris?

22:30.617 --> 22:32.552
It's a little awkward.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.886
I'll get it. I'm gonna get it.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.888
(chuckles)

22:35.922 --> 22:38.558
Mmm. That's good.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.026
Whoops.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.828
This place is nice.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.030
I've never been to a place where
they give you your own jacket.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.565
Do I get to keep this?

22:45.598 --> 22:47.500
(laughs)
No.

22:48.535 --> 22:49.502
No?

22:49.536 --> 22:50.503
So listen...

22:50.537 --> 22:52.672
I told everyone at work
about my new situation,

22:52.705 --> 22:54.574
and they were all very excited.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.743
That's great.
To meet you.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.878
Really?
Mm-hmm...

22:58.911 --> 23:01.448
You want me to meet
your coworkers?
Mm-hmm.

23:01.481 --> 23:04.584
You know, that's not a stage
in anyone's relationship.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.918
Oh, what are you talking about?
It'd just be something informal.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.119
Just, like, a little
dinner party.

23:07.153 --> 23:10.890
Uh, honestly, it'll be, like,
what, seven courses, tops.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.427
Look, Darryl, I am really happy
for you coming out,

23:14.461 --> 23:16.062
but I think you need
to relax, kind of.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.064
Relax? I... (scoffs)
I am relaxed.

23:18.097 --> 23:20.900
Why would you think
that I'm not relaxed?

23:20.933 --> 23:22.769
Uh, well, this is
kind of our first date,

23:22.802 --> 23:24.437
and this is the restaurant
where my parents came

23:24.471 --> 23:26.005
for their silver
wedding anniversary.

23:26.038 --> 23:29.008
I think we can just hang out,
you know? No strings.

23:29.041 --> 23:32.445
Maybe go someplace
that's flip-flop friendly.

23:32.479 --> 23:34.847
No strings.
Mm.

23:34.881 --> 23:37.517
Does that mean
you're dating other people?

23:37.550 --> 23:40.019
Well, I'm... I'm not not
dating other people.

23:40.052 --> 23:42.021
(sighs) Double negatives
always stress me out.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.155
I don't know what that means.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.156
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.692
I... I just think we should act

23:45.725 --> 23:47.994
like two normal people
who have kissed twice.

23:48.027 --> 23:50.062
You know, you can do
a little exploring,

23:50.096 --> 23:51.163
get on a dating Web site
or something,

23:51.197 --> 23:52.198
see what else is out there.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.736
Okay. Okay.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.238
I feel so much more
relaxed now. Thank you.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.511
May I?

24:07.580 --> 24:10.016
REBECCA: Anyway, I just
really need money right now.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.118
I'll give you ten.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.253
Ten thousand?

24:14.286 --> 24:16.122
Oh, my gosh, that's amazing.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.256
You won't be sorry.
The guy at the store said

24:17.289 --> 24:18.991
it had, like, smart
cushioning or some...

24:19.025 --> 24:20.192
No, ten dollars

24:20.226 --> 24:22.962
And if you lie down naked on it,
I'll give you an extra 25.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.964
I don't even need to be here,
I'll step out.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.233
I just need to know
that it happened.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.201
Okay, buddy,
just leave. Get out.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.205
And come back in a minute.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.074
Being naked's not
a problem for me.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.109
*

24:50.122 --> 24:51.190
(scoffs)

24:51.223 --> 24:54.193
Well, at least I still have
the rugelach from Mom.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.104
Hmm?

25:08.975 --> 25:10.943
No.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.945
*

25:12.979 --> 25:14.681
The Garfinkel ring.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.685
I think my mom is
about to give me...

25:18.718 --> 25:20.687
the Garfinkel ring.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.222
It's been passed down
in my family for generations.

25:25.124 --> 25:27.259
REBECCA: So how much you think
I can get for this?

25:27.293 --> 25:30.262
Oh, also I should mention
that it was used

25:30.296 --> 25:31.798
in conjunction with an ox

25:31.831 --> 25:34.200
to purchase
my great-great-grandmother.

25:34.233 --> 25:36.335
Yeah.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.170
Oh, and just so you know,
I'm gonna come back for it.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.206
I'm only selling this to
you for a couple weeks.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.207
Yeah, sure, great.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.709
I hear that all the time.

25:45.177 --> 25:47.279
So what is it, huh?
What is it?

25:47.313 --> 25:51.150
I mean, what's a pretty showered
girl like you doing here?

25:51.183 --> 25:52.418
It's nothing shady.

25:52.451 --> 25:54.654
I'm just trying to go to Hawaii
with someone else's boyfriend.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.122
That came out wrong.
They're breaking up.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.223
It's a long story.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.759
All's fair in love and war.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.928
But there a casualties in both.

26:01.961 --> 26:03.930
Wow, thank you, Confucius.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.231
Give me the cheddar.
(snaps)

26:07.266 --> 26:08.367
Good luck, princess.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.369
Thank you.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.371
I am a princess.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.373
And I'm also Kate Hudson.

26:14.406 --> 26:16.375
Paula and I didn't settle
on a metaphor.

26:16.408 --> 26:17.910
Never mind.
You don't know Paula.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.078
I'll be back for that.

26:19.111 --> 26:19.879
No. No, you won't.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.147
REBECCA: I'll be
back after Hawaii.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.153
(sighs)

26:33.225 --> 26:34.193
(sighs)

26:34.226 --> 26:35.728
Ooh.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.730
I'm gonna get doughnuts
at the Chinese place.

26:37.764 --> 26:39.065
Yeah.

26:39.098 --> 26:41.400
VALENCIA: Mom, Mom,
this is so exciting.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.769
I am so excited.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.236
I think it's finally
gonna happen.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.772
'Cause Joshy told me

26:45.805 --> 26:47.306
that we were gonna have
a big talk tonight.

26:47.339 --> 26:51.043
I think he's gonna propose, Mom.

26:51.077 --> 26:53.345
(Valencia laughs excitedly)

26:53.379 --> 26:54.881
I'm so excited.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.048
Ugh, I'm so relieved.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.184
I've been getting worried
that something was going on,

26:58.217 --> 27:01.187
but now I realize that
he was just acting nervous

27:01.220 --> 27:03.222
because he was buying me a ring.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.957
(Valencia laughs excitedly)

27:04.991 --> 27:06.793
Yeah, Joshy knows that I have
engagement rings on hold

27:06.826 --> 27:08.127
in every jewelry store in town,

27:08.160 --> 27:09.261
so I know he'll get
the right one.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.098
Josh and I are finally
getting engaged!

27:12.131 --> 27:13.165
I'm gonna celebrate

27:13.199 --> 27:15.234
by smelling the doughnuts
at the Chinese place.

27:15.267 --> 27:18.270
Okay. Love me more. Bye.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.241
God, what have I done?

27:27.213 --> 27:28.815
Okay, you want these shoes
or these shoes

27:28.848 --> 27:31.417
for the key ceremony?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.920
Paula, did you hear
what I just said?

27:33.953 --> 27:36.122
Valencia thinks
she's gonna get proposed to.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.290
And instead she's gonna find out
that she got cheated on.

27:40.459 --> 27:42.428
Um, suddenly I don't
feel so good.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.731
Well, I told you not to get
doughnuts at the Chinese place.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.265
It's not that.
Okay, look.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.901
She is not right for him.

27:48.935 --> 27:50.903
You know this.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.371
She is mean to him.
She doesn't respect him.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.040
She treats him terribly.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.909
Yeah, but they've been
together a long time.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.244
Yeah, too long.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.311
Long enough.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.748
Okay, you have nothing
to feel badly about, okay?

28:01.781 --> 28:03.215
He kissed you.

28:03.249 --> 28:05.117
He is clearly
unhappy.

28:05.151 --> 28:07.854
If you put it in your
fairy tale metaphor,

28:07.887 --> 28:10.857
this is the part where the funny
singing raccoon comes along

28:10.890 --> 28:12.191
and says, "You're the princess,

28:12.224 --> 28:15.461
and you get to rescue
the prince from the tower."

28:15.494 --> 28:17.129
You're right. You're right.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.464
Thank you.
You're right.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.966
It's not a good relationship.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.167
So put some shoes on.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.168
(snaps)
Let's go.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.837
I... I gotta text Josh.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.305
And I gotta tell him
not to tell Valencia.

28:26.338 --> 28:27.506
It's just the right thing to do.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.375
What?! Are you insane?!

28:29.408 --> 28:30.376
Give me that.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.310
(both talking at once)

28:31.343 --> 28:32.678
Give me back my phone!

28:32.711 --> 28:35.014
No! Give it back to me!
Uh, now, listen, you
are not gonna stop him

28:35.047 --> 28:36.082
Give it here!
telling her
about the kiss.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.084
We want them
to break up.

28:38.117 --> 28:39.051
I swear to God I will...

28:39.085 --> 28:40.319
Ha-ha! Got your phone.

28:40.352 --> 28:41.821
Ha-ha! Got your car keys.
What?

28:41.854 --> 28:45.057
Meet you at the ceremony.
Take a cab. I'll pay you back.
Are you k...?

28:45.091 --> 28:48.761
This never happened
to Rosie O'Donnell.

28:48.795 --> 28:50.396
*

28:57.804 --> 28:59.839
(Josh and Valencia
talking, muffled)

29:01.507 --> 29:04.210
JOSH (muffled): I should've
known better-- I kissed Rebecca.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.179
You did what? You kissed her?!

29:07.213 --> 29:09.081
I-I feel terrible. I...
You feel terrible.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.316
I got caught up
in the moment in court.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.418
I-I don't know what
happened; I'm sorry.

29:12.451 --> 29:16.388
I've never... been more
sorry in my life.

29:16.422 --> 29:18.290
(sighs)

29:18.324 --> 29:19.959
Oh...

29:23.595 --> 29:25.798
*

29:31.570 --> 29:33.772
Say something, please.

29:35.908 --> 29:37.977
Oh, wow, I mean, I... wow.

29:38.010 --> 29:41.313
I-I did not expect this
conversation to go like this.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.982
I expected something
so different.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.318
I thought that you were
gonna ask me to...

29:46.352 --> 29:49.288
Never mind.
I feel so stupid, I...

29:49.321 --> 29:50.890
JOSH:
I never meant to hurt you.

29:50.923 --> 29:53.092
Uh, this... this will
never happen again.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.498
I guess you want me
to move out, so...

29:59.531 --> 30:01.133
when I come back
from Hawaii...

30:01.167 --> 30:02.468
I didn't say that.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.307
Do you love her?

30:12.178 --> 30:13.379
No.

30:13.412 --> 30:16.382
JOSH:
God, no.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.417
*

30:33.132 --> 30:34.233
Josh...

30:34.266 --> 30:37.569
I am really, really hurt,

30:37.603 --> 30:41.107
but, God, I... I knew
something was going on.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.576
I mean, she's (sniffles)
smart and... and different

30:44.610 --> 30:47.346
and (chuckles) interesting.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.048
So I get it.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.318
You're not mad at me?

30:58.290 --> 31:00.259
You forgive me?

31:00.292 --> 31:03.429
Of course I forgive you, Joshy.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.364
I have to.

31:05.397 --> 31:09.435
You mean everything to me.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.503
I love you.

31:23.315 --> 31:26.352
No, I'll be here when you
come back from Hawaii,

31:26.385 --> 31:29.355
and we'll start over again.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.023
Honey, I'm not going anywhere.

31:31.057 --> 31:32.658
Uh, I'm staying here with you.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.360
I don't deserve you.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.395
You're beautiful and

31:36.428 --> 31:38.497
perfect like Madonna.

31:38.530 --> 31:40.599
The Bible Madonna.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.301
Not the buff Madonna.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.103
(both chuckle)

31:46.572 --> 31:49.575
*

31:54.480 --> 31:56.648
(thunder rumbles)

32:02.054 --> 32:05.958
* I try to be good to others

32:05.992 --> 32:09.661
* Treat my fellow men
like brothers and sisters *

32:09.695 --> 32:12.031
* That's the story
I'm the hero in *

32:12.064 --> 32:13.665
* So how come I can't zero in

32:13.699 --> 32:17.369
* On why this song
sounds so sinister? *

32:19.238 --> 32:21.240
Oh, my God.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.445
* I'm the villain
in my own story *

32:26.478 --> 32:29.381
* I'm the witch in my own tale

32:29.415 --> 32:33.352
* Though I insist
I'm the protagonist *

32:33.385 --> 32:37.056
* It's clear that
my soul is up for sale *

32:37.089 --> 32:40.059
* I'm the villain
in my own story *

32:40.092 --> 32:43.462
* The bad guy in my TV show

32:43.495 --> 32:45.364
* I'm the "who"
in the whodunit *

32:45.397 --> 32:46.732
* When I go to hell
I'll run it *

32:46.765 --> 32:49.768
* As Satan's CFO

32:49.801 --> 32:51.570
He needs someone
to do the books.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.039
Actually I shouldn't do that.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.273
I'm terrible with money.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.541
* But wait

32:55.574 --> 32:57.443
* How am I a villain?

32:57.476 --> 33:00.379
* I give annually to UNICEF

33:00.412 --> 33:04.116
* And just last week I helped
a lady cross the street *

33:04.150 --> 33:07.753
* Who was super old and deaf

33:07.786 --> 33:09.088
Wait, where am I?

33:09.121 --> 33:10.556
Aah, a bird!
(caws)

33:10.589 --> 33:14.226
* I'm the villain
in my own story *

33:14.260 --> 33:17.229
* I'm the bitch in the corner
of the poster *

33:17.263 --> 33:18.697
* I'm the figure
in the doorway *

33:18.730 --> 33:20.532
* Or the Kraken up in Norway

33:20.566 --> 33:23.669
* God, who is
this song's composer? *

33:23.702 --> 33:25.537
It's, like,
ridiculously sinister.

33:25.571 --> 33:29.475
Like, ri-dunk-culously sinister.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.810
(cackling)

33:31.843 --> 33:33.812
Well, well, well.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.748
Looks like I've
got you now, Valencia!

33:36.782 --> 33:39.485
What do you want to do with me,
you evil witch queen?

33:39.518 --> 33:41.620
I am but a humble
yoga instructor.

33:41.653 --> 33:44.356
Oh, what I want is...
your boyfriend!

33:44.390 --> 33:45.624
(gasps)
Not Prince Josh!

33:45.657 --> 33:47.526
Anything but Prince Josh!

33:47.559 --> 33:49.095
Why are you doing this?

33:49.128 --> 33:50.462
I'm Kate Hudson.

33:50.496 --> 33:51.730
We're doing the witch
and the princess thing.

33:51.763 --> 33:52.764
Okay?
Just go with it.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.467
Okay, so, fine,
I'm the princess.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.204
Why, why are you
doing this to me?

33:58.237 --> 34:00.739
Because I'm jealous
of you and your life!

34:00.772 --> 34:03.242
You're so skinny
and Josh is so perfect!

34:03.275 --> 34:05.744
And I want to take it
all for myself!

34:05.777 --> 34:07.579
No.
And now,

34:07.613 --> 34:10.416
I'll cook you into the
traditional dish of dinuguan,

34:10.449 --> 34:12.684
and serve it to Josh's family!

34:12.717 --> 34:14.186
(laughing)

34:14.219 --> 34:15.521
No!

34:15.554 --> 34:17.289
(laughing continues)

34:17.322 --> 34:20.092
No! No!

34:20.126 --> 34:21.092
(cackling)

34:21.127 --> 34:22.360
MAN:
Hey, shut up!

34:22.393 --> 34:25.264
* I'm the villain
in my own story *

34:25.297 --> 34:29.534
* My actions have
gone way too far *

34:29.568 --> 34:32.737
* I told myself
that I was Jasmine *

34:32.771 --> 34:36.608
* But I realize now I'm Jafar

34:36.641 --> 34:40.279
* We're told love conquers all

34:40.312 --> 34:44.449
* But that only
applies to the hero *

34:44.483 --> 34:48.754
* Is the enemy
what I'm meant to be *

34:48.786 --> 34:51.523
* Is being the villain

34:51.556 --> 34:56.661
* My destiny?

35:00.799 --> 35:02.801
(indistinct chatter)

35:07.539 --> 35:08.807
What time is it?
What time is it?

35:08.840 --> 35:11.677
(speaking indistinctly)

35:11.710 --> 35:12.444
Where is she?

35:12.478 --> 35:13.879
Oh, there she
is right there.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.314
(gasps)
Oh.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.683
Okay.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.651
Tell me you didn't do it.
Please tell me you're still

35:19.685 --> 35:20.619
going to Hawaii.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.554
And the moment
we've all been waiting for,

35:22.588 --> 35:24.356
the woman of the hour,

35:24.390 --> 35:25.691
Rebecca Bunch.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.326
(applause)

35:29.728 --> 35:31.730
*

35:40.239 --> 35:42.241
(sighs)

35:46.712 --> 35:48.714
Ew.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.354
Okay, that's it.

35:55.387 --> 35:57.556
What's going on?
With what?

35:57.589 --> 35:59.591
Look, I'm not stupid.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.460
I think you're mad at me.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.729
Yeah, 'cause you're so smart.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.231
Okay, but what did I do?

36:07.633 --> 36:09.701
You broke my heart,

36:09.735 --> 36:12.638
you dumb idiot jerkface!

36:12.671 --> 36:14.606
(groans)

36:25.251 --> 36:28.220
Okay, I probably shouldn't
dwell on particulars,

36:28.254 --> 36:29.721
but y broke up with me.

36:29.755 --> 36:30.656
You told me to run
after Rebecca.

36:30.689 --> 36:32.491
You did a whole song and dance.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.993
That was a test, you moron.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.696
And you were supposed
to say, "Oh, no.

36:37.729 --> 36:38.764
"That's ridiculous.

36:38.797 --> 36:40.532
"I couldn't possibly be
with her,

36:40.566 --> 36:42.668
"because I'm dating you
and you make me happy.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.236
And you're really hot."

36:44.270 --> 36:45.671
Oh, a test.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.507
God, I always fail the tests.

36:49.641 --> 36:51.810
I'm a jerk.

36:51.843 --> 36:53.612
Look.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.448
The mature rational side of me

36:56.482 --> 36:57.716
knows that you're not a jerk.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.786
You just don't feel the same way
about me that I do about you.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.589
But, so the emotional side of me

37:03.622 --> 37:06.392
wants to spear you
through the eye with this dart.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.659
Okay, I see.

37:07.693 --> 37:09.728
What can I do?

37:09.761 --> 37:11.597
What would make this better?

37:11.630 --> 37:15.334
You are just gonna have
to live with the uncertainty.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.638
'Cause I'm gonna be
sad and angry,

37:19.671 --> 37:21.873
and you're just gonna
have to live with it.

37:21.907 --> 37:24.510
Because I'm not
quitting this job.

37:24.543 --> 37:25.777
Not this time.

37:25.811 --> 37:27.479
'Cause I love it

37:27.513 --> 37:29.415
and I'm, like,
really good at it.

37:29.448 --> 37:30.782
You're...

37:30.816 --> 37:32.784
Yeah, you are.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.755
Heather, I'm sorry.
I messed up.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.790
Yeah.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.826
But that's, like, what you do.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.832
Everyone, let's get a round
of applause for our hero,

37:46.865 --> 37:49.801
the most wonderful woman
in West Covina,

37:49.835 --> 37:51.069
Rebecca Bunch!

37:51.102 --> 37:53.839
(crowd cheering)

37:53.872 --> 37:56.475
(distorted):
She is a true inspiration

37:56.508 --> 37:59.778
and the champion
of our community.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.813
Oh, yeah.
(crowd cheering)

38:07.819 --> 38:11.490
Sir, everything's
going, um, wobbly.

38:11.523 --> 38:13.859
Excuse me?

38:13.892 --> 38:16.395
I think my life is a giant turd.

38:16.428 --> 38:18.430
What?

38:20.899 --> 38:22.100
REBECCA:
 He doesn't love me.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.002
He doesn't
 love me.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.838
I'm broke, I'm broke.
 I hate my life.

38:26.872 --> 38:28.374
I'm the villain.
 I hate my life.

38:28.407 --> 38:29.541
I'm the villain.
 I'm broke.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.076
What's wrong with me?
 Why doesn't anyone love me?

38:31.109 --> 38:32.844
He doesn't love me.
 I hate my life.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.913
Why doesn't anyone love me?
 He doesn't love me.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.785
Um...

38:41.820 --> 38:43.822
Thanks.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.927
We got a runner!

38:48.960 --> 38:51.463
Have fun in Kazakhstan!

38:51.497 --> 38:53.499
(Paula whoops)

39:03.542 --> 39:07.413
I am so happy
we worked everything out.

39:07.446 --> 39:08.847
Like, I'm soy proud of us.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.650
Yeah, I thought for sure
you were gonna throw me out.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.151
That's the old me.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.388
The new me is very
mature and evolved.

39:16.422 --> 39:19.057
(laughs)

39:19.090 --> 39:20.726
I'm hungry.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.461
Should we get dinner?

39:22.494 --> 39:23.795
Okay, great.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.831
Uh, th-there's a new Indian
place on East Cameron.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.165
They have really good...
Joshy!

39:27.198 --> 39:29.501
You know Indian makes me gassy.

39:29.535 --> 39:31.637
Right, right.
Mm-hmm.

39:31.670 --> 39:34.172
Uh, you should choose.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.306
Give me the phone.

39:35.340 --> 39:38.410
Okay, well, delivery probably
is gonna take forever,

39:38.444 --> 39:40.446
so you should, you know,
you're gonna get it.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.481
(indistinct chatter)

39:44.550 --> 39:45.684
Hey, man.
Oh!

39:45.717 --> 39:46.752
How are you?

39:46.785 --> 39:48.086
I haven't heard
from you in a while.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.121
Oh, wow, I'm good.
Yeah?

39:50.155 --> 39:51.723
Actually, you know what?
I'm great.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.525
I-I took your advice,

39:53.559 --> 39:56.528
and it's been
really interesting.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.464
I bet.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.531
Yeah, I went out
with a girl named Charlie

39:59.565 --> 40:00.566
and a guy named Dana

40:00.599 --> 40:03.068
just to make things
as confusing as possible.

40:03.101 --> 40:06.171
(both laughing)

40:06.204 --> 40:08.874
I don't want to say I don't
like anyone as much as you,

40:08.907 --> 40:10.576
but...

40:10.609 --> 40:13.445
I think I just said it.

40:13.479 --> 40:15.547
Hmm.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.083
That's, uh,

40:18.116 --> 40:19.451
that's really sweet.

40:19.485 --> 40:21.920
It is?

40:21.953 --> 40:23.121
Yeah.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.459
You know what, Darryl?

40:27.493 --> 40:28.994
Why don't we start over?

40:29.027 --> 40:30.729
Wipe the slate clean.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.130
Keep things simple.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.231
Can I buy you a boba?

40:33.264 --> 40:34.933
Sure.

40:34.966 --> 40:35.801
Actually I cannot.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.503
'Cause I left my wallet
in that blazer.

40:37.536 --> 40:39.037
(laughs)

40:39.070 --> 40:39.905
I can spot you.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.474
But you still have to
get in the line.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.910
Oh, sorry, okay.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.945
(indistinct chatter)

40:51.950 --> 40:53.952
(sighs)

41:05.230 --> 41:07.533
Dr. Akopian.

41:09.668 --> 41:10.702
Can I have another seat?

41:10.736 --> 41:12.270
I-I also would like
another seat.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.605
WOMAN:
Ladies, I'm so sorry,

41:13.639 --> 41:16.474
but today's flight
is completely sold out.

41:24.115 --> 41:27.786
So we're stuck together
for the next five hours.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.588
You want to give it a go?

41:29.621 --> 41:30.922
Do some therapy?

41:30.956 --> 41:33.291
Okay.

41:33.324 --> 41:35.694
Yeah, let's do this.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.863
Okay.

41:37.896 --> 41:42.067
For starters, I was
conceived on a cruise ship.

41:42.100 --> 41:45.270
I think my mom must've had some,
I don't know, bad lobster.

41:45.303 --> 41:48.106
Because the second she felt
the sperm enter the egg,

41:48.139 --> 41:49.541
she got sick.

41:51.877 --> 41:52.878
In my narrative,
I pictured you as,

41:52.911 --> 41:53.945
like, the funny
singing raccoon.

41:53.979 --> 41:55.581
If you've got love problems,

41:55.614 --> 41:58.249
then listen to me,
Paula the raccoon.

41:58.283 --> 42:00.652
* Love is like digging
through a trash can *

42:00.686 --> 42:03.855
* Searching
for old banana peels. *
