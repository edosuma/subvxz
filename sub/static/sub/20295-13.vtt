-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.367 --> 00:36.433
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.000
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.033 --> 00:42.233
in a court of law.

00:42.267 --> 00:45.833
-I started shooting
when I was real young.

00:45.867 --> 00:49.533
As I got older
I shot competitively

00:49.567 --> 00:51.267
and even had the opportunity
to train

00:51.300 --> 00:54.000
at the Olympic training center
for a few years.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.700
It's a great hobby to have,

00:55.733 --> 00:59.867
especially because it's so
applicable to law enforcement.

00:59.900 --> 01:01.933
(on radio)
-We're getting a second call now

01:01.967 --> 01:03.833
reporting that the male
is beating his dog.

01:03.867 --> 01:05.133
It's a pit bull.

01:05.167 --> 01:07.533
They're saying he's
trying to hang him.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.600
-We're headed to a call.

01:10.633 --> 01:12.467
Unknown person called in

01:12.500 --> 01:15.667
saying that they are
seeing a person

01:15.700 --> 01:17.433
beating a dog with a belt,

01:17.467 --> 01:19.500
so we're gonna see
what's going on.

01:25.733 --> 01:27.100
What's going on?

01:27.133 --> 01:29.067
-(man speaks, indistinct)

01:29.067 --> 01:30.900
Can you come talk to me
for a sec?

01:31.900 --> 01:33.400
Is this your dog over here?

01:33.433 --> 01:34.600
-Yes.
-Okay.

01:34.633 --> 01:36.133
Do me a favor
and just put your stuff down.

01:37.867 --> 01:39.500
Okay.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.567
I got a report that
you're over here hitting
this dog. What's going on?

01:42.600 --> 01:45.067
-I'm just trying to give
the dog a bath, that's all.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.067
-You weren't--
-You can touch her right now,
she's wet.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.867
-Were you grabbing
at the collar?

01:49.900 --> 01:51.833
-Yeah, I gotta get her
inside the gate.

01:51.867 --> 01:54.467
-Okay. All right.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.667
Do you have your I.D.
on you at all?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.533
-No, I don't.
-Okay.

01:58.567 --> 02:01.867
Can you just do me a favor
and have a seat, please?

02:01.900 --> 02:03.833
-Can I actually just...
(indistinct), please?

02:03.867 --> 02:05.833
-What-- Is your dog okay?

02:05.867 --> 02:07.067
-Yeah, she's fine.

02:07.100 --> 02:08.100
-Why is she shaking?

02:08.133 --> 02:09.433
-Because I just
gave her a bath.

02:09.467 --> 02:10.867
You wanna touch? Look.
-Okay. Yeah.

02:10.900 --> 02:12.767
-Towel's right there,
that's the water.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.567
-Okay. Do you--
Just have a seat for me.

02:14.600 --> 02:16.333
Keep your hands
out of your pockets, please.

02:16.367 --> 02:18.200
Do you have your I.D. on you?
-No, I do not.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.900
-Okay, what's your name?

02:19.933 --> 02:21.667
-Can I ask you
what is this for?

02:21.700 --> 02:23.367
-Like I said,

02:23.400 --> 02:26.067
we got a report
that you were over here
trying to hurt your dog.

02:26.067 --> 02:28.733
We're just making sure
everything's good.
-I'm not hurting my dog.

02:28.767 --> 02:32.467
-Okay, but I need to I.D. you.
-Why?

02:32.500 --> 02:34.667
-Because we're doing
an official investigation

02:34.700 --> 02:36.667
and you're the person that
I need to talk to about it.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.667
-This is...
-All I need is your name
and your date of birth.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.333
-I am not--
I have no questions to answer.

02:42.367 --> 02:45.400
-Okay, that's fine,
but I need your name
and date of birth.

02:45.433 --> 02:46.933
-(inaudible)

02:46.967 --> 02:48.433
-Okay.

02:49.767 --> 02:52.133
-Are you arresting me right now?

02:52.167 --> 02:53.467
-Get over here!

02:53.500 --> 02:55.567
-I'm in my house.
I'm in my house.
I'm in my house.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.967
I'm in my house.
Why you in my house?

02:58.067 --> 03:00.200
I'm calling the cops.
Why you in my house?
-1-8-0, I need backup.

03:00.233 --> 03:01.300
-Why you in my house?

03:01.333 --> 03:03.133
-Put your hands
behind your back!
-For what?

03:03.167 --> 03:05.733
-Because I need to identify you,
you're part of an investigation.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.167
Put your hands
behind your back!

03:07.200 --> 03:09.600
-How am I part of
an investigation?
This is not making no sense.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.233
Y'all violating my rights.
Why y'all violating my rights?

03:12.267 --> 03:14.333
Why are you
violating my rights?!

03:14.367 --> 03:15.600
-Get on the ground!

03:15.633 --> 03:17.167
-Get on the ground!

03:17.200 --> 03:18.667
Stop resisting!

03:18.700 --> 03:20.800
-I'm telling you, man--
-Stop resisting!

03:23.133 --> 03:25.400
-Stop resisting!
-I'm not doing nothing!

03:25.433 --> 03:27.167
-Put your hands
behind your back!

03:27.200 --> 03:29.200
-Let go of me!
-Put your hands
behind your back!

03:29.233 --> 03:31.633
-Put your hand
behind your back!

03:31.667 --> 03:33.633
-Put your hand
behind your back!

03:33.667 --> 03:35.567
-Why you in my house?
-Stop resisting!

03:35.600 --> 03:36.967
-Why you in my house?

03:37.067 --> 03:39.100
-Put your hands
behind your back!

03:39.133 --> 03:40.767
-Why you beating on me?
Why you punching me?

03:40.800 --> 03:42.167
This is harassment!

03:42.200 --> 03:43.733
-Stop resisting.
-I know my rights.

03:43.767 --> 03:45.567
-Stop resisting!
-I know my rights!

03:45.600 --> 03:46.900
I know my rights!

03:46.933 --> 03:48.700
-Stop resisting!
-I know my rights!

03:48.733 --> 03:50.700
-Stop resisting!
-I know my rights!

03:50.733 --> 03:52.500
-Put your hand
behind your back!

03:52.533 --> 03:53.800
-I need a handcuff.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.233
-My eyes!

03:55.267 --> 03:58.500
-Aah! I know my rights,
what are you doing?

03:58.533 --> 04:00.367
-Put your hands
behind your back!

04:00.400 --> 04:01.667
-Oww, my eyes!

04:01.700 --> 04:03.900
-Drive, drive, drive!
-Go ahead, drive.

04:03.933 --> 04:05.067
-(taser crackling)
-Aah!

04:05.067 --> 04:07.300
(all shouting)

04:07.333 --> 04:09.067
-Aah! All right!

04:09.100 --> 04:10.933
-All right! I'm bleeding!

04:10.967 --> 04:12.933
-Put your hands
behind your back!
-I didn't do nothing!

04:12.967 --> 04:15.700
-Put your hands
behind your back!
-I'll do it again!

04:15.733 --> 04:17.067
Jesus Christ!

04:19.367 --> 04:21.433
-Why you doing
this to me, yo?

04:21.467 --> 04:24.067
I didn't didn't (bleep)
do anything wrong.

04:24.100 --> 04:25.600
I'm sitting on my porch,

04:25.633 --> 04:28.967
and you pepper spray me
and punch me in my (bleep) face.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.067
-I hit the side.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.067
-Yo, this is crazy.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.633
I know my rights!

04:33.667 --> 04:35.233
Yo, this is crazy, for real.

04:35.267 --> 04:37.067
Y'all violating my rights.

04:37.067 --> 04:40.567
Y'all violating my rights,
and I know my (bleep) rights,
I'm not stupid.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.133
Y'all violating my rights.

04:42.167 --> 04:45.833
-Where-- which car?
-Right there. Mine. Three.

04:45.867 --> 04:48.233
-Giving my dog a bath,
somebody calls the cops,

04:48.267 --> 04:50.367
they heard the dog crying.

04:50.400 --> 04:53.233
Yo, I can't (bleep) see.

04:53.267 --> 04:56.400
-Relax. Just breathe.

04:56.433 --> 04:59.767
-I'm not understanding how
y'all can do this, though.
I'm really not.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.233
-Follow directions.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.767
-I can't--
Yo, I can't see.

05:02.800 --> 05:05.833
-(radio chatter)

05:05.867 --> 05:08.200
I can't see, yo.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.467
-He's gonna go
to the hospital right now.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.533
Get checked out
for his injuries.

05:12.567 --> 05:14.900
-Yo, I didn't
(bleep) do nothing!

05:14.933 --> 05:16.767
-You fought with this officer,

05:16.800 --> 05:18.300
I came to help,
you fought with me.

05:18.333 --> 05:19.767
Then you fought
with everybody else.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.067
-All right. So, we come up,

05:22.067 --> 05:26.300
we got two calls
saying that this guy's
over here hanging his dog.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.633
Trying to hurt him.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.367
The dog's over
in the corner shaking.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.433
I said, "Sir, you're under
an investigation regarding
dog abuse.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.067
"I need your name
and your date of birth."

05:35.100 --> 05:37.567
I said it a couple times.
He refused.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.667
I went to go
take custody of him,

05:40.700 --> 05:42.533
he pulled away,
he ran in the house,

05:42.567 --> 05:44.567
and then the fight was on.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.300
We're gonna have to go back,

05:46.333 --> 05:48.400
identify who he is,
and then go from there.

05:48.433 --> 05:51.333
I'm gonna call the witnesses
from back at the station

05:51.367 --> 05:53.333
and see what's going on.
-All right. I'll leave
you to it.

05:53.367 --> 05:56.067
-We do-- We need
someone to check out that dog
still though.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.300
-Check out the dog.

05:57.333 --> 05:59.067
-I should probably
just call the animal shelter.

05:59.067 --> 06:00.600
See if there's somebody
out at the shelter.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.900
-(radio chatter)

06:02.933 --> 06:04.767
-Hiya. How are you?

06:04.800 --> 06:07.267
-Did we call for-- see if
the animal shelter's open?
-It's okay. See?

06:07.300 --> 06:10.200
-Obviously, you're
the one that called.

06:10.233 --> 06:12.433
Can you tell me a little bit
about what you saw?

06:12.467 --> 06:15.467
-Um, me and my friend
were looking out my
living room window

06:15.500 --> 06:18.400
and we saw the gentleman
with his dog.

06:18.433 --> 06:20.433
And he was giving it
a bath at first,

06:20.467 --> 06:22.800
but then he brought it
onto his porch,

06:22.833 --> 06:24.700
and he was, like,
dragging it by the leash

06:24.733 --> 06:27.867
to the point where he was, like,
taking it off the ground.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.967
And we--
Like, he took a belt

06:31.067 --> 06:32.567
and we saw he started
hitting the dog.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.167
And it was yelping, like,
very clearly, we could hear it.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.400
-Did you see him hit the dog?
-Yeah.

06:37.433 --> 06:38.433
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

06:38.467 --> 06:39.700
-And the dog kept yelping?

06:39.733 --> 06:41.333
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.
-Okay.

06:41.367 --> 06:43.100
Thank you so much for calling.
-You're welcome.

06:43.133 --> 06:45.133
And I really--
I really appreciate

06:45.167 --> 06:47.733
you going out there
and, you know,

06:47.767 --> 06:49.733
looking out for that
dog's safety.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.100
-Yeah.
-So, appreciate it.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.367
-No problem.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.067
-Dog's gonna go
to the animal shelter tonight.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.500
He's gonna get checked out.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.767
And the guy's gonna go
to jail tonight

06:58.800 --> 07:00.867
for hitting the dog
and fighting with us.

07:04.333 --> 07:05.767
-My family suffered a very
personal tragedy.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.067
I lost an 18-year-old daughter
to a drunk driver.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.233
Her name was Ashley.

07:09.267 --> 07:11.900
And what brings me to work
every day is Ashley.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.567
And I put one foot in front
of the other in her memory

07:14.600 --> 07:17.100
to do everything I can to go
out there and make a difference.

07:17.133 --> 07:19.800
Going to a weapons call.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.733
A disturbance in
an upper apartment.

07:21.767 --> 07:23.800
One of the parties
involved probably

07:23.833 --> 07:26.400
has a knife, is what they're
reporting right now.

07:26.433 --> 07:30.133
-(radio chatter)

07:36.633 --> 07:37.833
-Hey, can you tell us
what happened?

07:37.867 --> 07:39.800
-I called because--
this is my daughter

07:39.833 --> 07:42.067
and her husband--

07:42.067 --> 07:43.800
They're getting
married Saturday,

07:43.833 --> 07:45.400
but they had
their wedding party today

07:45.433 --> 07:46.933
because they can't get married
till Saturday.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.200
They had it out
at Ashwaubomay park.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.300
They came back here and they--

07:51.333 --> 07:53.867
-We had about
five friends with us.
-Okay.

07:53.900 --> 07:57.600
-Yeah. And everybody was just
minding their own business
out here,

07:57.633 --> 08:02.800
but the guy upstairs was
really drunk and acting stupid

08:02.833 --> 08:05.133
and we asked him
to please leave us alone,
and it's a private--

08:05.167 --> 08:06.767
-So you guys started
fighting upstairs?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.333
-Chad's her husband.

08:08.367 --> 08:10.533
-That's my husband, the one
in the back yard.
-The one laying down?

08:10.567 --> 08:12.500
-Yeah. They were wrestling
each other.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.233
-Is that why he's laying down?
-It might be.

08:14.267 --> 08:16.067
Because we got
in an argument,

08:16.067 --> 08:17.600
and then he tried
to push me down the steps.

08:17.633 --> 08:18.767
-Is he still upstairs?

08:18.800 --> 08:21.433
-Yes, he is. And then that's
when my husband

08:21.467 --> 08:23.933
got into it with him because
he tried to push me.

08:23.967 --> 08:25.800
And then his
two friends came down.

08:25.833 --> 08:28.733
The girl that has been staying
up there for about a month now

08:28.767 --> 08:30.900
came out at me with a knife

08:30.933 --> 08:33.633
saying, "Go downstairs,
go downstairs."

08:33.667 --> 08:35.233
And she was
holding it like this.

08:35.267 --> 08:36.767
-There's a guy up on
the stairs with...

08:36.800 --> 08:38.300
-Hands up! Hands up!

08:38.333 --> 08:40.233
-Let's see your hands!
-Hands up now!

08:40.267 --> 08:42.667
Walk down the stairs slowly.

08:42.700 --> 08:45.467
-Keep your hands up!
-Walk down the stairs!

08:45.500 --> 08:48.067
-Yes, sir.
-And he's the one that
was wrestling on the ground

08:48.067 --> 08:49.967
over here?
-They were upstairs
on the porch.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.333
He tried to push me.

08:51.367 --> 08:54.567
-Turn around! Face away
from the sound of my voice!

08:54.600 --> 08:55.767
-Hey, hey, look--

08:55.800 --> 08:57.700
-Hands up! Hands up! Hands up!
-Show me your hands!

08:57.733 --> 08:59.767
-Keep your hands up!

08:59.800 --> 09:01.567
-Man, you can shoot me,
I don't give a (bleep)

09:01.600 --> 09:02.700
-Keep your hands up!

09:02.733 --> 09:03.833
-Stay there right now. Hold on.

09:03.867 --> 09:05.100
-I'm gonna come down right here.

09:05.133 --> 09:06.533
-Help me stand this guy.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.267
Hey, stand on up.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.100
We got you,
we got you, we got you.

09:10.133 --> 09:11.733
-Can you hurry up
with the aspirin?

09:11.767 --> 09:13.067
-What's your first name?

09:13.067 --> 09:14.367
-Verle.
-Hey!

09:14.400 --> 09:16.300
-Hey, look, man.
Come on, knock it off.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.967
-All right, hands up!
-Hold out your hands!

09:18.067 --> 09:19.700
-Keep your hands up!
-Put your hands up in the air,

09:19.733 --> 09:21.100
step out! Step out!

09:21.133 --> 09:22.933
-Hey, one at a time.
One at a time.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.500
-Keep walking. Stop there.

09:24.533 --> 09:25.800
Turn around, face away from me.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.700
-Hey, I don't care if you
shoot me or not, it's cool.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.067
-Don't shoot!

09:29.067 --> 09:30.533
-I don't care.

09:30.567 --> 09:32.333
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir, yes, sir.

09:32.367 --> 09:33.833
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

09:33.867 --> 09:35.167
Come on, bro,
don't do this.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.600
-Keep your hands up in the air.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.700
Walk down the stairs now!

09:38.733 --> 09:39.833
Keep your hands up!

09:39.867 --> 09:41.600
On your knees.

09:41.633 --> 09:43.433
Put your hands
behind your back.

09:43.467 --> 09:44.767
Hands behind your back.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.100
-How? Which--
-Behind your back.

09:46.133 --> 09:47.867
-Like this?
-Just like that, thank you.

09:47.900 --> 09:52.067
-Hey, we're here because there
was a knife involved in
the disturbance, okay?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.667
Come over here.

09:55.700 --> 09:58.233
-Why am I in handcuffs?

09:58.267 --> 09:59.467
-Chad's in the ambulance.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.200
So, you and Chad were
punching each other?

10:01.233 --> 10:03.133
-No, sir.
-Nobody fell down?

10:03.167 --> 10:04.200
-No, sir.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.733
-When did you go back up
inside the house?

10:06.767 --> 10:09.867
-I never went down
out of my house.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.633
-So Chad came up to you?

10:11.667 --> 10:13.667
And you guys had some words?
-Yes, sir.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.467
-And then it escalated
into some pushing.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.500
-Yes, sir.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.267
-How did you get
the bloody lip?

10:18.300 --> 10:21.433
-Maybe from push and shove?

10:21.467 --> 10:22.500
-Push and shove?

10:22.533 --> 10:24.000
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

10:24.033 --> 10:26.633
-They was gonna get married
and get engaged today, right?

10:26.667 --> 10:28.400
Yes, sir,
I have been drinking.

10:28.433 --> 10:32.967
-That's okay. You can drink.
-But I offered them two shots
in a cup of soda,

10:33.000 --> 10:35.200
and they're like,
"get the (bleep) out of here!
Shut the (bleep) up!

10:35.233 --> 10:36.600
"This is a private party!"

10:36.633 --> 10:38.833
I blew it off,
I didn't say nothing else.

10:38.867 --> 10:40.133
I walked back upstairs--

10:40.167 --> 10:41.433
-So that was down here?

10:41.467 --> 10:44.067
-Yes, sir.
And then they came upstairs

10:44.100 --> 10:45.867
and harassed my roommate,

10:45.900 --> 10:48.333
and they hit my girl with
a broom, bro, I swear, like--

10:48.367 --> 10:49.900
-Who hit your girl
with a broom?

10:49.933 --> 10:52.167
-Um, Ashley hit my girlfriend
with a broom.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.300
-Okay.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.633
-And, um, Verle, like,
um, Chad,

10:56.667 --> 10:59.767
he come out there starting
like, "Don't touch my girl,
don't do this."

10:59.800 --> 11:01.300
Honestly, all right,

11:01.333 --> 11:04.567
look, Chad
and his wife Ashley...

11:04.600 --> 11:06.300
was, you know, aggressive,

11:06.333 --> 11:09.433
so, yeah, man, like,
I'm not lying, I swear, man.

11:09.467 --> 11:10.800
And honestly...

11:10.833 --> 11:13.533
Um, Ashley, out in...

11:13.567 --> 11:14.967
Man, I'm sorry, man.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.433
-All right. Just relax.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.067
-All right.
The reason why we're here

11:18.067 --> 11:20.433
is because there was a knife
involved and they say that
you had a knife.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.300
Are you injured from
this disturbance at all?

11:22.333 --> 11:26.133
-Yes, my (bleep) head 'cause
she was hitting me with
a broomstick.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.800
-Who hit you with
a broomstick?

11:27.833 --> 11:29.133
-Ashley.

11:29.167 --> 11:30.667
-She hit you with
a broomstick tonight?

11:30.700 --> 11:32.967
Like, just before you
ended up with the knife?

11:33.067 --> 11:35.067
-Do you wanna feel
my (bleep) head?

11:35.100 --> 11:36.333
-All right.
Do me a favor. Stand up.

11:36.367 --> 11:38.233
You don't have any weapons
on you, do you?

11:38.267 --> 11:40.167
All right. Stand up for me.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.333
I got you.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.200
I got you.
-They came around to see--

11:43.233 --> 11:45.800
-Stand up.
-And I don't care what's
going on between other people.

11:45.833 --> 11:47.700
-Put your feet
apart for me.

11:47.733 --> 11:48.933
Where's your head hurt?

11:48.967 --> 11:50.700
-Right side.
-Right side?

11:50.733 --> 11:52.200
Right here?
-Um, up more.

11:52.233 --> 11:53.667
Up more.
-Well, I feel
a bump right here.

11:53.700 --> 11:55.633
-And all around--
Back more.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.867
All around.
-And that happened today?

11:57.900 --> 11:59.600
-Yeah.
-What time today?

11:59.633 --> 12:02.933
-That's what happened.

12:02.967 --> 12:05.967
And that's why I grabbed
the knife and told her
to get the (bleep) out!

12:06.067 --> 12:07.200
-Okay. All right.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.300
-Okay, so Ashley grabs a broom,

12:09.333 --> 12:11.900
she admits to swinging it
at the female with the knife.

12:11.933 --> 12:14.067
-I don't think her action
with the knife was unreasonable

12:14.067 --> 12:15.467
considering what was happening.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.500
-I agree. All right, Ashley,
here's the deal.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.633
When you swung
that broom at her,
you clocked her in the head.

12:19.667 --> 12:21.333
She's got some pretty good
knots up on her head.

12:21.367 --> 12:23.367
She had to get looked at
by rescue, okay?

12:23.400 --> 12:24.833
-I'm going to jail?
-Yep.

12:24.867 --> 12:27.167
So I need you to turn
around and put your hands
behind your back.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.600
-Can I say goodbye to my kids?

12:28.633 --> 12:30.533
-I need you to turn
around and put your hands
behind your back.

12:30.567 --> 12:32.067
Here, just--
hang on a second.

12:32.067 --> 12:33.100
-Verle getting arrested?

12:33.133 --> 12:34.633
-Yes.
-Thanks.

12:34.667 --> 12:35.967
-I'm sorry.

12:36.067 --> 12:37.833
-Is she getting arrested?
Because she pulled
a knife on me,

12:37.867 --> 12:39.900
and that's not right.
She's allowed to pull
a knife on me?

12:39.933 --> 12:41.300
-We'll talk about that
a little bit more,

12:41.333 --> 12:43.300
but no, to be honest with you,
she's not. Okay?

12:43.333 --> 12:45.633
-Jesus Christ.
-Thanks, Mom!

12:45.667 --> 12:46.967
-I'm sorry, babe.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.567
-How much does it cost
to get me out?

12:48.600 --> 12:49.600
-I don't know.

12:49.633 --> 12:51.367
-On my wedding day,
I get to go to jail.

12:51.400 --> 12:53.667
-All right, Verle, go ahead
and have a seat for me, sir.

12:54.933 --> 12:57.367
-Oww!
-Sometimes it's easier
if you sit sideways.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.600
-Oww. I'm a big guy.

12:59.633 --> 13:00.900
-You are a big gentleman.

13:00.933 --> 13:03.067
-(slurring)

13:03.067 --> 13:05.700
-Would you like me to help you
back out to re-attempt this?

13:05.733 --> 13:08.133
-No...
-No, you got it?

13:08.167 --> 13:09.200
-Fantastic.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.733
-Unfortunately, things got
out of control.

13:10.767 --> 13:13.067
Alcohol was obviously a factor.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.700
But the problem is
when the disturbance
ends up upstairs,

13:16.733 --> 13:18.367
inside her apartment.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.933
So, what started out as
a weapons call

13:19.967 --> 13:21.767
ends up being three people
going to jail,

13:21.800 --> 13:23.433
one person being issued
and released.

13:26.633 --> 13:29.800
-I'm the first person
in my family to get into
law enforcement.

13:29.833 --> 13:31.733
I was taking criminal
justice courses--

13:31.767 --> 13:33.767
I was interested in
criminal law--

13:33.800 --> 13:36.067
and in one of my classes

13:36.067 --> 13:39.100
one of the deputies from
the sheriff's office came down

13:39.133 --> 13:42.467
and talked about this program
called "Explorer's program"

13:42.500 --> 13:45.833
They said it was new,
I ended up joining.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.900
Ended up doing a ride along
and fell in love with it,

13:48.933 --> 13:52.467
and I just knew this was what
I wanted to do.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.933
There's a suspicious vehicle
that's pulled into this
truck stop up here.

13:55.967 --> 14:00.433
This truck stop's known for high
drug activity and prostitution.

14:00.467 --> 14:02.667
And they pulled up to the back.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.067
So we're gonna figure out
what's going on,

14:05.067 --> 14:07.200
and get the occupants
out of the vehicle.

14:07.233 --> 14:11.500
-(radio chatter)

14:13.533 --> 14:15.400
-Hey, what y'all up to?

14:15.433 --> 14:16.633
Why'd y'all come in the back?

14:16.667 --> 14:18.500
-We was turning around,
going back,

14:18.533 --> 14:20.467
you flashed us and so...
-You flashed us
and we pulled up.

14:20.500 --> 14:21.667
-Okay. Who's in the back seat?

14:21.700 --> 14:22.933
-She's a friend of ours.

14:22.967 --> 14:24.667
-All right. Who's the vehicle
belong to?

14:24.700 --> 14:26.067
-My sister.
-Your sister.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.067
You have I.D. on you?

14:28.100 --> 14:29.767
-No, my wallet got stolen.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.300
-Your wallet got stolen?
-Yes, it did.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.400
Like, three days ago.

14:32.433 --> 14:33.800
-So you don't have no I.D.?

14:33.833 --> 14:34.867
-No.
-Okay.

14:34.900 --> 14:36.400
Come over to our car
so I can run you.

14:36.433 --> 14:38.233
Hey, stay right here.

14:38.267 --> 14:40.100
-Yes, ma'am. Okay.

14:40.133 --> 14:41.700
-And put him in your car.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.367
You have I.D. on you, bud?

14:45.400 --> 14:46.833
How do you know him?

14:46.867 --> 14:49.600
-Uh, we were just--
When I moved down here
I became homeless--

14:49.633 --> 14:52.067
-That's your I.D.?
-Oh, no, I'm sorry.

14:52.067 --> 14:53.800
And after I became homeless,

14:53.833 --> 14:54.933
being on the street you--
-Okay.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.367
Who's the car belong to?
-His sister.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.067
As far as I know,
his sister.

14:58.067 --> 15:00.233
-Okay. How long has he
had the car?

15:00.267 --> 15:01.700
-As long as I've known him.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.500
-Okay. Do you have any weapons
on you or anything?

15:03.533 --> 15:04.933
-I have a knife in
my front right pocket.

15:04.967 --> 15:06.567
-All right. Just checking.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.133
Ma'am, what're
you reaching for?

15:08.167 --> 15:09.833
-Oh, I was just trying to find
me some cigarettes.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.367
-Just keep your hands up
where I can see 'em, okay?

15:12.400 --> 15:15.500
-Can I still find my cigarettes?

15:15.533 --> 15:16.833
-What'd y'all come to
the store for?

15:16.867 --> 15:18.400
-To get something to drink.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.600
Hang out for a little bit.
Watch some TV, 'cause
we're homeless.

15:20.633 --> 15:21.733
-Y'all got any meth on you?

15:21.767 --> 15:23.333
-No, ma'am.
-No meth?

15:23.367 --> 15:24.900
-No, ma'am.
-Y'all come up here for that?

15:24.933 --> 15:26.067
-No, ma'am. Come on.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.900
-I know what
this place is for.

15:27.933 --> 15:29.867
I know all about this place.
-Look, if I wanted meth,

15:29.900 --> 15:31.567
come on, here?

15:31.600 --> 15:33.067
-And you didn't know
she was a prostitute?

15:33.100 --> 15:34.400
-No, I--
-She just gets in your car

15:34.433 --> 15:35.833
and has sex with you?
-She has a husband.

15:35.867 --> 15:37.867
She has a husband and they
fight a lot. They're fighting.

15:37.900 --> 15:40.133
-Okay, so she just gets in
the car and brings this
with her?

15:40.167 --> 15:41.500
-She brought all kind of
stuff with her.

15:41.533 --> 15:43.367
-All right. I'm gonna hang on
to this, okay?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.933
You said you've already been
arrested for unauthorized use
of motor vehicle.

15:46.967 --> 15:48.600
And you say that's
your sister's car.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.633
-Yes, sir.

15:49.667 --> 15:50.867
-She bought it
two days ago?

15:50.900 --> 15:52.533
-She bought it, like,
two, three, something like that.

15:52.567 --> 15:53.900
The papers are
in the glove box.

15:53.933 --> 15:55.533
-Where you staying?

15:55.567 --> 15:57.467
-Uh...

15:57.500 --> 16:00.267
Well, I want to say something
like all the way across town,

16:00.300 --> 16:03.267
other than that,
at my sister's and other places.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.400
-Where have you been staying?

16:04.433 --> 16:05.900
-I'm asking where you
park your car?

16:05.933 --> 16:07.700
-Oh, wherever. At the stores.
-Okay.

16:07.733 --> 16:10.467
-Here, at the other
store down there.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.667
-You know what this place
is about, right?

16:13.700 --> 16:15.367
-No, sir.
-We know what this
place is about.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.433
-Yes, sir.

16:16.467 --> 16:17.800
-Look at his eyes,
you can just tell.

16:17.833 --> 16:18.900
-I know.

16:18.933 --> 16:20.333
-I have none of that,
I promise.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.767
-Dude...
-I haven't had any
meth today, sir.

16:21.800 --> 16:24.133
-Your eyes are
the size of saucers.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.400
Okay, when was the last
time you used?

16:26.433 --> 16:29.200
-Maybe yesterday, day before.
I promise you, I didn't--

16:29.233 --> 16:31.067
-Your eyes are
the size of saucers.

16:31.100 --> 16:32.400
-That's what I--

16:32.433 --> 16:34.267
-And there's a light shining
right in them

16:34.300 --> 16:36.067
and they're not
constricting at all.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.600
We're gonna cut y'all loose,

16:37.633 --> 16:39.500
but just know we're out here,
all right?
-Yes, sir.

16:39.533 --> 16:41.333
-Next time we're gonna
find you with something.

16:41.367 --> 16:42.667
I know we are.

16:42.700 --> 16:45.700
We either got here too late
or too soon.

16:45.733 --> 16:47.333
We're gonna find you
with something. Okay?

16:47.367 --> 16:50.433
And then you're not gonna have
a choice but to get clean

16:50.467 --> 16:51.567
'cause you're gonna
be locked up.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.667
You did eight months you said
for a UUMV?

16:53.700 --> 16:54.933
-No, Seven.

16:54.967 --> 16:56.633
-How-- seven?
-Seven.

16:56.667 --> 16:59.267
-All right. I'm gonna put your
knife back in your car.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.733
-Yes, sir.

17:00.767 --> 17:02.200
Thank you.
-Prove us wrong.

17:04.700 --> 17:07.167
-Okay, y'all wanna get help
for that meth problem,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.600
then there's ways to do it.

17:09.633 --> 17:11.067
Okay? There's
churches out there.

17:11.067 --> 17:13.133
-I been getting help
a little bit, you know--

17:13.167 --> 17:14.467
-Scott.

17:21.433 --> 17:22.767
-That's not mine, I promise.

17:22.800 --> 17:24.733
-Hey, that's not his, sir.

17:24.767 --> 17:27.600
-That's not mine, I promise.
-We don't have any of those,
we've been looking for those.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.233
-I promise, that's not mine.

17:29.267 --> 17:31.700
-Officer, it's mine.
That is mine, 100%.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.067
-Is it used?
-It is, yes, sir.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.233
-We're gonna find
residue in it?

17:34.267 --> 17:36.533
-Uh, no, sir, there shouldn't.

17:36.567 --> 17:37.867
-You flushed it?

17:37.900 --> 17:39.067
-Yes, sir, with bleach.

17:40.167 --> 17:41.167
-Meth?

17:41.200 --> 17:42.933
-Sir, it's not mine.

17:42.967 --> 17:45.333
-Right now, until we figure out
whose it is, everybody's
going in handcuffs.

17:45.367 --> 17:46.567
-Boss, what do you--
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.133
Boss, what do you
want me to do?

17:48.167 --> 17:49.967
-We're gonna test it,
we'll see.

17:51.367 --> 17:53.433
Put your butt back
on the hood... bumper.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.633
-You know what,
come over here to my car.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.867
I want to keep y'all separated.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.167
-Yes, ma'am.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.467
It's my fault.
-That's yours?

18:00.500 --> 18:01.500
-That is mine, 100%.

18:01.533 --> 18:02.833
Mine 100%.

18:03.867 --> 18:06.367
100%.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.367
-Any type of what people would
consider paraphernalia,

18:09.400 --> 18:12.167
there's gonna be residue
of a drug in that paraphernalia,

18:12.200 --> 18:14.100
whether it's a pipe, a syringe.

18:14.133 --> 18:16.400
Here in the state of Texas
the district attorney

18:16.433 --> 18:19.200
will actually accept that as
possession of methamphetamine

18:19.233 --> 18:21.067
in what's called a trace case.

18:21.067 --> 18:24.700
So now what we're looking for
is either a blue or purple color

18:24.733 --> 18:27.067
on the Q-tip here.

18:29.933 --> 18:33.433
And, as you can see, there's
enough methamphetamine in it

18:33.467 --> 18:36.700
that the liquid, all of
the liquid is actually turning
that purple color.

18:36.733 --> 18:39.433
So that's gonna be a positive
test for methamphetamine.

18:41.467 --> 18:43.400
-Okay, where are you gonna go?

18:43.433 --> 18:45.333
-I just want to go home.

18:45.367 --> 18:47.100
And here is where my home is.

18:47.133 --> 18:48.867
-We'll get you home.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.333
Just don't go off with strange
men you don't know in
the middle of the night.

18:51.367 --> 18:54.200
'Cause that's how people
go missing and get hurt.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.800
-I know. That's what
I'm scared of.

18:55.833 --> 18:57.700
-So, when we saw the syringe,

18:57.733 --> 19:00.467
you started yelling that
it was yours and not your
buddy's over there.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.867
Right?

19:01.900 --> 19:03.067
Is that true?
-Yes, sir.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.467
-Buddy over there had no idea
you threw it down,

19:05.500 --> 19:07.267
had no idea--
-He didn't even know
I had it.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.200
-Okay.
-We'd been looking for one.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.733
So, I mean, he had no idea
that I had it.

19:11.767 --> 19:13.467
That's just the nature
of the drug, I guess.

19:13.500 --> 19:15.533
(bleep) being selfish,
and greedy and...

19:15.567 --> 19:16.933
wanting to have it for your own,
you know,

19:16.967 --> 19:18.567
and not letting anybody else
have it.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.200
-You know you're
under arrest now.
-Yes, sir.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.767
-So, I mean, there's
nothing you can do about that.
-Yeah.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.567
-Now, just to satisfy
our curiosity,

19:24.600 --> 19:26.733
were y'all coming up here
to find something?
-No, sir, we weren't.

19:26.767 --> 19:27.967
No, we weren't.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.633
-Okay.
-We don't even have
money for anything.

19:29.667 --> 19:30.933
We have nothing in the car.

19:30.967 --> 19:33.067
All we have-- Like, I just lost
every (bleep) possession.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.500
Thank you
for taking me to jail.

19:34.533 --> 19:35.667
I'm (bleep) starving to death.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.267
I'm freezing cold,
you know what I'm saying?

19:37.300 --> 19:40.900
We don't have money for food.
I don't even have cigarettes.

19:40.933 --> 19:43.067
I have nothing. So...

19:43.100 --> 19:44.433
-Well, we're gonna
transport you,

19:44.467 --> 19:46.500
get you fed,
and get you warm, okay?

19:46.533 --> 19:49.067
Get you clean for
at least a little bit, okay?

19:50.767 --> 19:52.600
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:52.633 --> 19:54.567
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.733
Cover is code three.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.733
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:05.533 --> 20:07.500
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:07.533 --> 20:08.700
-(theme music playing)
