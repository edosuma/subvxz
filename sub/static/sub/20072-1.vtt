Now, what you need to get

33:33.544 --> 33:34.978
is capital.

33:40.852 --> 33:41.918
Okay.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.022
Close the door.

33:54.899 --> 33:56.867
Now, you need to diversify.

34:03.174 --> 34:04.474
Maybe...

34:05.576 --> 34:08.678
Maybe you work for me
exclusively and not for Roy.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.217
All right.

34:15.719 --> 34:16.786
Sure.

34:19.991 --> 34:21.257
Oh?

34:21.260 --> 34:22.993
You like a roley?

34:25.029 --> 34:27.563
I got a drawer
of them right here.

34:27.565 --> 34:28.864
You know how I got them?

34:31.034 --> 34:32.902
By being resourceful.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.306
Women like resourceful.
Don't they, Myron?

34:38.176 --> 34:39.342
Yeah.

34:42.480 --> 34:44.281
No bank accounts.

34:44.283 --> 34:45.748
My money in bags.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.589
Good.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.092
Good.

34:58.863 --> 35:00.831
And we got work to do together.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.934
Every day we hustling.

35:05.503 --> 35:06.570
Every day.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.874
Go on.
She cook something for you.

35:53.684 --> 35:55.218
Are you all right?

35:57.421 --> 36:00.857
Did you take care of the situation
with doughboy down by the docks?

36:11.369 --> 36:13.403
Get some lumber
for me at the yard.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.005
Pick it up and bring it
to my house.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.307
All right. No problem.

36:50.241 --> 36:52.309
It's a full moon tonight.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.878
How long have you known Roy?

36:55.379 --> 36:56.446
I told you.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.515
My whole life.

36:58.517 --> 36:59.883
He taught me to swim.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.953
He lost his daughter
when I was young.

38:27.004 --> 38:28.905
Hey, can I get a rum runner?

38:29.874 --> 38:31.007
What do you want?

38:31.009 --> 38:32.075
Whatever. A beer.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.543
And a beer. Thanks.

39:02.740 --> 39:03.807
Drink up.

39:07.611 --> 39:08.878
Yeah.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.314
So what are we here for?
Just a drink?

39:16.921 --> 39:18.054
Whatever, Lewis.

39:23.294 --> 39:24.861
Can I get a shot?

39:24.863 --> 39:26.730
Come on, Nadine.

43:43.921 --> 43:46.122
Hey. What you crashing
here for, boy?

43:46.124 --> 43:47.190
Lewis!

43:48.292 --> 43:49.359
Lewis!

43:49.361 --> 43:50.526
Stop it!

43:50.528 --> 43:51.728
Lewis, get on up.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.103
What's your problem?

44:37.441 --> 44:38.508
Come on.

44:39.643 --> 44:40.777
Sit with me.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.368
It's full moon tonight, Lewis.

45:09.307 --> 45:11.207
Is it?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.009
It doesn't really
look like a full moon.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.212
Trust me, Lewis.

45:16.547 --> 45:17.613
Full moon.

45:18.916 --> 45:21.284
It's definitely not a full moon.

45:23.253 --> 45:24.587
Who says?

45:28.425 --> 45:29.759
Enjoy the weather, boy.

45:32.629 --> 45:34.230
Don't fight the island.

46:23.347 --> 46:24.680
Hey, mom.

46:25.482 --> 46:27.917
It's Myron.

46:27.919 --> 46:31.154
It's my birthday and I just wanted
to say that I love you and that...

46:49.706 --> 46:50.773
We can't.

46:53.076 --> 46:54.143
Can't.

46:55.345 --> 46:56.512
We have to try.

46:58.849 --> 47:00.817
You weren't there.

47:00.819 --> 47:01.884
I was there.

47:12.529 --> 47:14.197
It's just those little feet.

47:24.541 --> 47:25.975
- I...
- I needed you then.

47:34.051 --> 47:35.585
So what's the point then?

47:35.587 --> 47:36.886
I can't do this.

47:56.740 --> 47:57.807
Hey, baby.

47:58.375 --> 48:00.109
Full moon tonight.

48:07.184 --> 48:08.251
Mmm-hmm.

48:11.188 --> 48:12.521
Thank you, baby.

48:18.629 --> 48:19.695
Yeah.

48:21.064 --> 48:23.132
I'll be inside right now.

48:36.179 --> 48:39.215
<i>Off the Bahamas,
at least 30 people were killed</i>

48:39.217 --> 48:41.851
<i>when a sailboat packed
with immigrants from Haiti</i>

48:41.853 --> 48:43.953
<i>struck a reef and...</i>

48:43.955 --> 48:45.821
<i>More than 100 were rescued.</i>

48:45.823 --> 48:48.624
<i>The search for victims continues
through the rough seas.</i>

52:55.539 --> 52:57.039
Fuck!

52:57.041 --> 52:58.541
Why don't we just
call the police?

52:58.543 --> 53:00.709
It's not like that here, Lewis.

53:00.711 --> 53:02.244
Roy is the police.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.450
Hey, man.

53:11.254 --> 53:12.955
Anything about a boat get
picked up?

53:12.957 --> 53:14.356
What boat?

53:14.358 --> 53:16.959
Phillip's boat.
It's gone stolen.

53:16.961 --> 53:18.027
No, no.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.962
I ain't hear nothing about
no boat got stolen.

53:21.531 --> 53:23.032
You see Myron?

53:23.034 --> 53:24.433
No, I ain't seen Myron today.

53:26.670 --> 53:29.271
All right. You hear anything,
you call me.

53:29.273 --> 53:30.706
For sure, no problem.

54:19.923 --> 54:20.990
Should you tell your dad?

54:22.425 --> 54:23.892
No, Roy will figure it out.

54:27.130 --> 54:29.865
Hey. Hey,
maybe we should just go.

54:31.201 --> 54:32.735
I don't know, maybe.

54:59.996 --> 55:02.131
<i>Everyone going out,
with the stars tonight,</i>

55:02.133 --> 55:04.166
<i>for a lookout
there on the ports.</i>

55:04.168 --> 55:07.736
<i>Got a full moon, you tourists look out for
the low tides, gonna be a major party.</i>

55:09.874 --> 55:12.675
Right, right.

55:13.076 --> 55:14.076
Yeah.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.814
Uh...

55:18.816 --> 55:20.416
Doughboy.

55:21.918 --> 55:24.286
I told you I can't be having
that shipment coming late.

55:24.288 --> 55:26.789
Hey, I am waiting for it,
yeah? Yeah.

55:27.857 --> 55:29.091
As...

55:29.093 --> 55:30.259
The fuckery!

55:30.261 --> 55:31.960
What you have me doing that for?

55:31.962 --> 55:34.196
The village people.
They've been here a long time.

55:34.198 --> 55:35.664
You know they're my people, eh?

55:37.867 --> 55:40.569
Yeah? They your people, boy?

55:40.571 --> 55:41.970
"They your people" meaning what?

55:43.306 --> 55:45.541
They property is my property.

55:45.543 --> 55:49.345
Everything on this island
ain't yours, boy.

55:52.148 --> 55:55.150
That boat not back here by sundown,
boy, there gonna be trouble.

56:03.793 --> 56:05.661
If I see it, I'll let you know.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.955
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

01:02:39.957 --> 01:02:41.490
<i>Captain Roy, over.</i>

01:02:41.492 --> 01:02:42.991
<i>Reef crash emergency.</i>

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:45.060
<i>Capsized, stolen contender.</i>

01:02:45.062 --> 01:02:46.928
<i>A lot of people in the water.</i>

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:49.397
<i>Full personnel needed...</i>

01:02:49.399 --> 01:02:53.168
<i>All vessels turn
to channel 60. Over.</i>

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:57.465
What happened?

01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:58.667
Help me with this one.

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:03.438
Another boat
they found on the river.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.540
Contender, they using
for human trafficking.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:08.276
Hold him down. I have to give
him a shot of Albuterol.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.316
Sit him up.
He can't stay lying down.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:19.421
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be...

01:04:19.423 --> 01:04:20.589
What's your name?

01:04:22.091 --> 01:04:23.725
Jean-Pierre.

01:04:23.727 --> 01:04:25.360
Jean-Pierre.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:27.128
You're gonna be fine, okay?
You're safe.

01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:28.663
Okay? Good.

01:04:28.665 --> 01:04:30.532
Nadine, hold this.

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:34.236
Where's his mom?

01:04:34.238 --> 01:04:35.303
Dead.

01:04:45.115 --> 01:04:46.214
Andre.

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:47.282
Andre?

01:04:47.284 --> 01:04:49.284
Andre's here.
Andre's here. Hey...

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:51.853
Look, look, Andre's here.
Right there.

01:04:51.855 --> 01:04:53.321
Here you go. Andre's here.

01:05:30.259 --> 01:05:32.928
Hey, you okay?

01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:44.272
Nadine? Lewis?

01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.742
You okay, son?

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.077
Roy, I need your help.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:58.153
Myron, how you doin', boy?

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:02.457
Myron.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.127
Captain Roy!

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:46.968
You think you can handle all of these
problems all by yourself, Roy?

01:06:46.970 --> 01:06:48.536
It don't look good for you
or for me

01:06:48.538 --> 01:06:51.873
having to report all this
nonsense back to Nassau.

01:06:51.875 --> 01:06:54.309
They expect me to handle it
and get to the bottom of it.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:59.314
We've been calling these south
islands the "wild, wild west"

01:06:59.316 --> 01:07:01.316
with all the things
been going on around here.

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:03.184
Yes, and I call this home.

01:07:03.953 --> 01:07:05.553
You're getting old, boy.

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.856
You're slipping away.

01:07:07.858 --> 01:07:10.258
You know they've been
smuggling around these parts

01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.629
trafficking everything
from coke, pot, live cargo.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:17.766
You see, captain Roy.
You all are just the same.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:21.202
You work with the things
of the old time.

01:07:22.471 --> 01:07:24.272
Of the land and the ocean.

01:07:25.941 --> 01:07:30.245
The damn boat that was stolen
is the boat that capsized.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.649
How do you figure
how that be, huh?

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:37.685
How do you explain?

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.855
And how am I gonna look talking
to the tourism minister

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:43.224
when they're watching
the fox and the CNN

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:46.327
with a flood of Haitian bodies
floating in our waters,

01:07:46.329 --> 01:07:48.596
from rich, white peoples'
stolen boats?

01:07:48.598 --> 01:07:51.833
This island
is my responsibility.

01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:54.135
I take care of it,
you understand?

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:56.604
Then do it.

01:08:17.326 --> 01:08:19.828
Remember that morning
we named him?

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:28.069
I wanna feel like that again.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:33.575
And I do too.

01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.578
I miss you.

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:41.749
Hey, hey.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.751
Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre,
oh shit!

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:47.154
Jean-Pierre, hey, hey, hey.
Jean-Pierre, Jean-Pierre.

01:08:47.157 --> 01:08:48.323
Fuck, can we get some help?

01:08:48.325 --> 01:08:49.756
- Somebody come help, man.
- Help!

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:51.359
- Help!
- Oh, shit.

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:52.861
- Help!
- Help!

01:08:57.633 --> 01:08:58.700
Come on.

01:09:00.803 --> 01:09:02.437
Just bring it...

01:09:09.345 --> 01:09:10.411
He's dead.

01:10:03.599 --> 01:10:05.700
She said we have to take
the baby.

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.768
What?

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:08.770
She said, "take the baby."

01:10:12.776 --> 01:10:14.943
No, no.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:16.110
- Listen...
- I can't do this.

01:10:16.112 --> 01:10:17.779
- I can't do this.
- Listen to me.

01:10:17.781 --> 01:10:19.747
He's got nobody, all right?

01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.352
I'm here now.

01:11:59.948 --> 01:12:02.216
What's the matter, eh, girl?

01:12:06.088 --> 01:12:07.155
Where doughboy?

01:12:11.894 --> 01:12:12.960
He here?

01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.898
Huh?

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.935
Even he ain't real.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:59.374
Where is he?

01:12:59.376 --> 01:13:01.075
Where's doughboy, tell me?

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:09.317
He went to go find Myron.

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.149
Hey, my friend.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:34.962
We're fine, okay?

01:15:39.635 --> 01:15:41.068
I love you.

01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:39.727
Want a beer, boy?

01:16:43.198 --> 01:16:44.265
Open!

01:16:53.475 --> 01:16:55.142
I'm not gonna say nothing.

01:16:58.046 --> 01:16:59.486
I'm gonna tell nobody
about the boat.

01:17:02.017 --> 01:17:03.484
You play your numbers yesterday?

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:10.524
I lost.

01:17:10.526 --> 01:17:14.128
But sometimes you win.
Sometimes you lose.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:17.031
Ain't nothing I can do
about that, huh boy?

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:22.103
If you're gonna do it, do it!

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:23.938
Take your time, boy.

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.009
It only happens once.

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.247
Sometimes you get
your number called.

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:35.983
Number.

01:17:38.553 --> 01:17:40.254
Numbers, numbers.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:43.057
What are you waiting for?

01:17:43.959 --> 01:17:45.359
Yeah, boy.

01:17:48.230 --> 01:17:50.031
I like you.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.669
Friendship ain't got
nothing to do with this.

01:17:57.172 --> 01:18:01.208
Yeah, you see!
This is how it is.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:05.312
Men gotta do things
they don't want to do.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.018
I come with the goods,
the merchandise.

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.220
I've got great things...
I've got...

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.361
Drink! Drink up boy.

01:18:24.132 --> 01:18:25.199
Yeah!

01:18:29.771 --> 01:18:31.072
People are dead.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:36.177
People are always dead.

01:18:39.748 --> 01:18:40.815
Always.

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:44.919
All right.

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:46.420
Fuck.
