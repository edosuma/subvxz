WEBVTT

00:07.966 --> 00:09.217
MAL'AKH:
Peter will point the way.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.051
Previously on
"The Lost Symbol"...

00:10.093 --> 00:11.469
He's got Peter.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.555
CIA? I thought the Bureau
handled kidnappings.

00:13.596 --> 00:15.223
SATO: So, this hand belonged
to Peter Solomon.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.558
Peter was my mentor.

00:16.599 --> 00:18.727
SOJANI:
Solomon's kid worked for us?

00:18.768 --> 00:20.395
Briefly. Three years ago.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.938
He was beaten to death.
In Ankara.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.149
LANGDON: The capstone
could complete the message.

00:26.109 --> 00:28.153
Mal'akh needs you
to find the portal.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.238
We have more work to do, Robert.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.407
Your fate
is in Robert's hands now.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.117
If I'm gonna help your dad,
I got to go.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.494
I'm coming with you.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.836
(subway rattling)

00:44.878 --> 00:46.880
(drumming)

00:48.965 --> 00:50.800
(crowd chatter)

01:02.520 --> 01:04.606
-What is that?
-Gilded edges,

01:04.647 --> 01:07.776
Hebrew...
Probably a religious text.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.362
(reading Hebrew)

01:11.946 --> 01:14.824
-Ah, my Hebrew's a little rusty.
-Okay, I have an app.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.619
Right. 'Cause you never Google.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.788
-I didn't say anything.
-Yeah, I know your looks.

01:19.829 --> 01:21.122
I work on the
Global Consciousness Project

01:21.164 --> 01:22.290
with scientists from all over.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.667
This has saved me
more than once.

01:26.002 --> 01:29.547
First Kings, chapter three.
Old Testament.

01:29.589 --> 01:32.842
First Kings, chapter three.
Uh, the Judgement of Solomon.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.386
Huh.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.221
(phone buzzes)

01:36.262 --> 01:37.847
Langdon...

01:39.182 --> 01:40.433
LANGDON:
What? Who sent this?

01:40.475 --> 01:41.935
"Pass the wayfarer.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.520
Find the wolf."

01:45.980 --> 01:47.524
What?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.361
We should go.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.867
-Katherine. Your phone.
-What? Oh.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.998
Pass the wayfarer...

02:04.040 --> 02:05.834
What are you doing?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.217
Find the wolf.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.263
There's a hatch here.

02:19.014 --> 02:21.182
(drumming intensifies)

02:21.224 --> 02:23.560
* *

02:28.148 --> 02:30.483
(grunts)

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
BELLAMY:
There's a bolt to the left.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.571
Slide it over.

02:34.612 --> 02:36.489
-Warren?
-(bolt thuds)

02:36.531 --> 02:38.199
It's good to see you,
Katherine.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.910
Sorry it's under
these circumstances.

02:40.952 --> 02:42.954
-Phones?
-We left them.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.206
-Good.
-Does someone want to tell me
what's going on?

02:45.248 --> 02:47.751
We can talk on the way.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.255
* *

03:07.479 --> 03:08.897
Where'd you lose him?

03:08.938 --> 03:10.899
ADAMU: Tunnel, on the way
to the platform.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.400
I don't know.
He was there, then he wasn't.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.235
And Solomon's daughter
was with him.

03:14.277 --> 03:15.862
Katherine?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.155
We'll keep looking,

03:17.197 --> 03:18.782
check the cameras,
comb the tracks.

03:18.823 --> 03:20.909
-They've got to be close.
-Boss is here.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.744
Keep me posted.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.002
BLAKE: We're saying
disgruntled employee.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.337
Workplace shooting.

03:32.379 --> 03:33.922
-Apolitical.
-SATO: It's my fault.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.340
I left him exposed.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.800
You did your job.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.594
What about the shooter?

03:39.636 --> 03:42.597
The janitor is
Nicholas Bastin. 37.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.517
Former Army medic.
Honorable discharge 2015.

03:45.558 --> 03:48.478
No criminal record.
Politically ambivalent.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.938
Six months ago,
he goes off the grid.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.649
-And the other one?
-No hits. He's a ghost.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.109
And in addition to leaving
a severed hand

03:54.150 --> 03:56.569
at the Capitol, he left
two uniforms half-dead

03:56.611 --> 03:58.613
in the park a mile away.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.825
What if there's a connection?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.493
To...?

04:05.870 --> 04:08.581
Zachary Solomon died
in a prison riot in Turkey.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.376
And whoever killed him...

04:11.418 --> 04:12.669
left this.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.879
Triskelion.
It's an important symbol

04:14.921 --> 04:16.131
in Freemasonry.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.425
Or maybe you're reading
too much into this.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.260
You're making it personal.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.720
Maybe.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.054
And the artifact you found
in the Capitol basement?

04:23.096 --> 04:25.223
The pyramid's gone.
With Langdon.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.726
And with it, many secrets.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.686
We've heard of this portal.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.979
And we are interested in it

04:31.021 --> 04:32.480
and any information
it might lead to.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.315
But from where I'm sitting,

04:34.357 --> 04:37.861
it looks like our best chance
to find it has flown the coop.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.446
We need Langdon.

04:39.487 --> 04:42.490
What about Peter Solomon?

04:42.532 --> 04:45.326
We can walk and chew gum.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.871
But I would manage
my expectations on that front.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.165
MAL'AKH (recording):
Peter is in the Araf.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.583
LANGDON:
I'm sorry, what?

04:51.624 --> 04:53.668
MAL'AKH: The borderland
between Heaven and Hell.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.004
LANGDON: Yeah, thank you.
I know what the Araf is.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.298
MAL'AKH: And whether
he returns to your world

04:58.340 --> 04:59.799
or moves on to the next

04:59.841 --> 05:01.426
will depend on your actions.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.136
He might already be dead.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.889
That call was made
from Solomon's phone.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.558
You were monitoring him?

05:10.477 --> 05:13.396
We monitor a great many people.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.861
Find Langdon.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.203
BELLAMY:
I've been friends with Peter
for 30 years.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.621
LANGDON:
Freemason friend?

05:30.747 --> 05:32.290
"The Wayfarer."

05:32.332 --> 05:34.793
A painting by Bosch known for
its Masonic references.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.961
I'm sorry for all
the cryptic texts,

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
but I was afraid your messages
were being monitored.

05:39.381 --> 05:40.715
LANGDON:
Right.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.050
So we're just supposed
to follow you now?

05:42.092 --> 05:43.551
-No questions.
-I trust him.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.095
He was like an uncle
to me and Zach.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.596
Which doesn't explain
how he knew where to find us.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.223
I used to be with
the State Department.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.684
Then I got a new job:
Architect of the Capitol.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.560
Which puts me in charge

05:52.602 --> 05:55.772
of every building
in the Capitol complex.

05:55.814 --> 05:58.733
I know everything that goes on

05:58.775 --> 06:01.569
in these buildings
and under them.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.574
(door closes loudly)

06:06.616 --> 06:08.451
We're under
the Library of Congress now--

06:08.493 --> 06:11.079
the old circulation room.

06:13.456 --> 06:14.958
LANGDON:
Huh.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.587
-So that's the, uh...
-The old conveyor system.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.715
It ran books
under the other two buildings.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.717
Look, you'll be safe here.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.093
Just lay low for a bit.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.262
Lay low? How is that
going to help Dad?

06:27.303 --> 06:29.806
BELLAMY:
Just until we figure out
our next steps.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.856
May I see it?

06:57.667 --> 07:00.587
LANGDON:
I used the Mason cipher

07:00.628 --> 07:02.964
to translate it, but...

07:03.006 --> 07:04.924
It requires the capstone
to be understood.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.010
You know about the capstone.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.514
Do you know
where we can find it?

07:12.307 --> 07:13.850
No.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.813
Long ago, the Master Masons,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.524
they hid the pyramid
and the capstone

07:21.566 --> 07:24.319
in two different locations.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.738
No one person is allowed to know

07:26.780 --> 07:28.782
the location of both pieces.

07:28.823 --> 07:31.493
Dad kept this in his safe.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.328
We think it might be a clue.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.996
It's from First Kings.
The Judgment of Solomon.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.247
KATHERINE:
It's just your typical,

07:36.289 --> 07:37.749
moderately disturbing
Bible tale.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.167
I don't know why
he'd keep it in a safe.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.127
-Neither do I.
-LANGDON: There has to be

07:41.169 --> 07:44.089
something about this
beyond the story we all know.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.218
Well, if there is,
I don't know about it.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.014
Rest.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.684
I'll press my contacts
to find out

07:55.725 --> 07:57.477
if there's more information
about your father.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.688
Katherine...

08:00.730 --> 08:03.149
I'm so sorry.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.052
Extra phone?

08:34.264 --> 08:36.141
It's not mine.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.565
Back at the Capitol,

08:43.606 --> 08:45.900
they had me in a room,
under guard.

08:45.942 --> 08:50.196
A man came in
dressed like a janitor.

08:50.238 --> 08:54.909
He shot the guards
and gave me this.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.289
Mal'akh.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.958
That's what he called him.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.627
The person who took Peter.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.963
How many people
are a part of this?

09:07.797 --> 09:08.840
I don't know.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.924
And the hand?

09:09.966 --> 09:12.635
How do they know it was Dad's?

09:12.677 --> 09:14.554
It was his ring.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.639
Well, a ring can be switched.

09:16.681 --> 09:20.018
The hand had been
severed... recently.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.728
That still doesn't prove
it was his.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.188
Y-You're right.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.356
No, don't do that.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.775
Don't humor me.
I'm not going to break.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.568
I-I don't know
what I'm supposed to say.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.320
That's not a surprise.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.824
I'm sorry. I'm just trying
to process all of this.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.165
I just need him to be okay.

09:48.213 --> 09:50.215
Me, too.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.677
(inhales sharply)

09:54.928 --> 09:56.346
(exhales sharply)

10:01.351 --> 10:03.186
(groans)

10:28.503 --> 10:30.714
* *

10:32.882 --> 10:35.135
(rattles softly)

10:46.896 --> 10:49.107
(hinges creaking)

11:10.503 --> 11:12.088
* *

11:13.089 --> 11:14.674
ISABEL:
Trafficking?

11:14.716 --> 11:16.593
What does that even mean?

11:16.634 --> 11:18.303
Well, u-usually,
it refers to, uh,

11:18.345 --> 11:20.472
illegal trading,
dealing narcotics...

11:20.513 --> 11:22.766
In this case,
a staggering amount of heroin

11:22.807 --> 11:24.517
found in Zachary's apartment.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.061
The question is, what are
we going to do about it?

11:26.102 --> 11:28.521
Um, Professor Sahin
wrote a study

11:28.563 --> 11:30.440
on the Turkish justice system
for Human Rights Watch.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.441
She might have a contact.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.068
Maybe this is just
what he needs.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.278
To rot in a decrepit,
Second World prison?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.781
To not be rescued
from his own mistakes.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.449
ISABEL:
He doesn't need
your lessons right now.

11:39.491 --> 11:41.451
He needs your love.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.036
I gave him my love.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.788
He rejected it.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.414
You wanted him to be
just like you.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.793
To share in your obsession
with all of this... trivia.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.461
That's what he rejected.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.922
But it doesn't mean that you
get to stop being his father.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.465
Excuse me.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.636
(Langdon sighs)

11:59.678 --> 12:02.263
You don't really think
we should leave him there.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.307
Robert, am I being unfair here?

12:04.349 --> 12:07.018
You-you don't have
to answer that.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.062
I-I think you're just...

12:09.104 --> 12:11.064
a father
in a difficult situation,

12:11.106 --> 12:14.192
and I... I get that.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.576
(door closes softly)

12:34.212 --> 12:36.423
(quiet footsteps approaching)

12:45.890 --> 12:46.850
Hey.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.351
Hey. Hey.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.603
KATHERINE:
Langdon, what are you doing?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.022
Let go. He took the page.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.356
I thought he was holding
something back before.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.400
He knows why it's important.

12:56.401 --> 12:57.235
Is that true?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.403
I took an oath to protect it.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.487
Protect what?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.698
The ancient wisdom.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.199
BELLAMY:
Look, I understand

13:03.241 --> 13:05.535
-your skepticism...
-Do you? How generous.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.287
But there are other things
at play here.

13:07.328 --> 13:10.040
I know these stories.
And that is all that they are.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.208
Take the myth of
the Masonic pyramid,

13:12.250 --> 13:15.003
built so high God could
reach out and touch it.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.339
And you're telling me that's
what they're talking about?

13:17.380 --> 13:18.840
Well, perhaps those stories

13:18.882 --> 13:20.216
were deliberately exaggerated.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.177
-To what end?
-So that academics

13:22.218 --> 13:23.803
like you would
continue to believe

13:23.845 --> 13:25.221
they're a myth.

13:25.263 --> 13:26.890
So no one would search for them.

13:26.931 --> 13:27.891
It's a piece of rock.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.351
It's a map.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.398
(clicking nearby)

13:35.440 --> 13:37.484
KATHERINE:
What was that?

13:37.525 --> 13:40.445
Maybe we should continue
this discussion upstairs.

13:44.491 --> 13:47.786
There's a sect
within the Masons.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.705
Very small and very secret.

13:53.708 --> 13:54.918
The Leviathan Group.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.504
Our purpose is to make sure

13:57.545 --> 13:59.589
that the ancient wisdom
stays hidden,

13:59.631 --> 14:03.134
until such time
as the world is ready.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.386
This is what Peter wants.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.596
So h-he also took your oath.

14:06.638 --> 14:10.016
You said the pyramid was a map.
What does that mean?

14:10.975 --> 14:13.019
It is said that,
when brought together,

14:13.061 --> 14:14.646
the pyramid and the capstone

14:14.688 --> 14:17.774
will reveal the location
of the portal.

14:17.816 --> 14:22.028
And you think Peter would die
to keep this secret?

14:24.989 --> 14:28.868
You're entitled to your beliefs,
as unhinged as they are,

14:28.910 --> 14:30.995
but this is his life.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.175
What is it, anyway,
this secret wisdom?

14:44.217 --> 14:46.136
Is it an... an equation?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.679
An invocation?

14:47.721 --> 14:49.014
BELLAMY:
No one knows.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.516
No one living, at least.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.187
Well, this is all
very on-brand for Dad.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.819
He'd always say
that modern physics

15:02.861 --> 15:04.571
was only starting to comprehend

15:04.612 --> 15:07.032
what the ancients knew
to be true.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.535
He's why I do what I do.

15:10.577 --> 15:14.164
He's very proud of your work.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.209
The genetics of psychic ability,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.545
collective consciousness...

15:22.630 --> 15:24.883
A lot of people
think it's crazy.

15:25.967 --> 15:29.429
But for all my certainty that
I'm right and they're wrong,

15:29.471 --> 15:31.973
there is always a subtle voice
in my head,

15:32.015 --> 15:33.141
this doubt:

15:33.183 --> 15:36.227
What if it's not real?

15:39.773 --> 15:42.442
Don't you want to know
if it's real?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.031
I'm not sure I'm meant to know.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.825
KATHERINE:
I saw the way you looked
at that pyramid.

15:50.867 --> 15:53.203
I know that look.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.749
You may never get
this chance again.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.210
Help us find it.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.176
The Hebrew...

16:12.764 --> 16:14.641
It's code.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.519
If that's true,
then there has to be a way

16:17.560 --> 16:19.896
to decipher it.
A key.

16:19.938 --> 16:21.106
BELLAMY:
Yes.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.899
And Peter's the only one
that has it.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.901
That's how it goes.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.736
One veil is lifted

16:26.778 --> 16:28.279
only to reveal another.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.739
He'd have it close.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.241
Somewhere he can keep
an eye on it.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.493
Maybe even on him.

16:36.162 --> 16:38.373
Override key
for the safe in my lab.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.749
I keep it on me at all times.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.252
-Does Peter even wear jewelry?
-Just one piece.

16:42.293 --> 16:44.254
His ring.

16:45.046 --> 16:46.214
You don't wear yours.

16:46.256 --> 16:47.799
Only for functions.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.135
-A lot of Masons do that.
-Not my dad.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.928
He always wears his.
Always.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.222
It's small. It doesn't mean
it's not concealing information.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.265
Problem is:
it's in the possession

16:55.306 --> 16:56.683
of the Capitol Police.

16:56.725 --> 16:57.934
I don't suppose
these tunnels could sneak us

16:57.976 --> 16:59.185
into their evidence room.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.603
I can't help you with that.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.772
I might know someone who can.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.943
NUÑEZ:
You know they make it
out of pig bones, right?

17:06.985 --> 17:07.986
Gelatin.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.237
You a vegan?

17:09.279 --> 17:11.322
Hell no. I eat animals.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.991
The meat parts,

17:13.033 --> 17:14.325
not the... other parts.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.120
I could, uh...
get you some applesauce.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.663
Why all the baby food?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.332
Doctor said the bullet
didn't hit anything important.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.376
Still, you're technically
recovering from surgery.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.296
Okay, I'll take the applesauce.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.757
(clears throat)

17:30.216 --> 17:32.635
(Nuñez exhales)

17:35.597 --> 17:37.432
(footsteps approaching)

17:37.474 --> 17:39.517
That was quick.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.685
No, wait!

17:40.727 --> 17:42.771
NURSE (distorted):
You awake, awake?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.647
(normal voice):
You awake?

17:51.237 --> 17:52.697
I think so.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.242
You have a visitor.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.373
Hey.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.459
How you feeling?

18:04.501 --> 18:07.712
Pretty good, you know?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.340
Doc says I could be out
in a day or two.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.092
How's your agent?

18:12.133 --> 18:13.176
Oat Milk.

18:13.218 --> 18:14.594
He didn't make it.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.723
Damn. Sorry.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.517
Can you tell me what he said?

18:20.558 --> 18:23.186
The shooter. To Langdon.

18:23.228 --> 18:25.855
I don't know.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.857
It's all just...

18:29.526 --> 18:32.278
It's okay. Don't force it.

18:32.320 --> 18:35.031
Who is he? The janitor.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.449
I mean, there's got to be...

18:36.491 --> 18:40.036
video, facial recognition,
fingerprints...

18:40.078 --> 18:41.913
You get an ID yet?

18:41.955 --> 18:43.373
Can't say.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.376
Hey, it's me, remember?

18:46.418 --> 18:48.378
The guy who stopped
the giant wall

18:48.420 --> 18:49.963
from turning us all into panini?

18:50.005 --> 18:51.756
(chuckles softly)

18:53.675 --> 18:56.386
Dude came into my building.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.596
That building.

19:00.223 --> 19:02.559
You know what I'm saying?

19:04.269 --> 19:06.563
Give me a name.

19:11.276 --> 19:13.403
Right.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.363
It's a need-to-know world.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.282
(Adamu clears throat)

19:21.244 --> 19:23.038
Get some rest.

19:24.456 --> 19:26.791
(indistinct chatter)

19:32.422 --> 19:33.882
Someone's helping them.

19:33.923 --> 19:35.633
And I still don't know
how they got out of there.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.260
We swept the station
in every direction.

19:37.302 --> 19:39.512
-What about down?
-The tunnels?

19:39.554 --> 19:42.223
There's no public access.

19:42.265 --> 19:44.851
This isn't a public person.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.979
Think they might've
dropped this.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.568
When you found Katherine
in her father's house,

19:53.610 --> 19:55.779
did you search her?

19:55.820 --> 19:56.946
Mm-mm.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.656
It's okay.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.575
The Capitol Power Plant on 25th

20:00.617 --> 20:02.660
should be able to tell us
who has access to the tunnels.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.912
I'll head over now.

20:03.953 --> 20:05.121
Where you gonna be?

20:05.163 --> 20:06.373
Peter Solomon's.

20:06.414 --> 20:08.667
(bell tolling in distance)

20:10.543 --> 20:12.796
* *

20:40.573 --> 20:42.826
Well done.

20:43.827 --> 20:47.455
We'll be needing more sedative.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.500
I'll go see my contact
at the hospital.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.253
Unless you need me
looking after Solomon?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.963
No, it's fine.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.590
He isn't going anywhere.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.678
* *

21:28.496 --> 21:30.749
* *

21:32.500 --> 21:34.711
(clank, whirring)

21:36.046 --> 21:38.089
(whirring stops)

21:51.770 --> 21:53.146
ZOE:
I don't understand.

21:53.188 --> 21:54.564
Was it political?

21:54.606 --> 21:55.940
Was he some kind of
insurrectionist, or what?

21:55.982 --> 21:58.568
I don't know.
They're trying to figure it out.

21:58.610 --> 22:00.362
Look, for four years
I went to sleep

22:00.403 --> 22:02.530
afraid that you were gonna
be blown up by an IED

22:02.572 --> 22:03.907
or get your head chopped off.

22:03.948 --> 22:05.658
We're supposed to be safe here.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.411
Hey, hey. It's okay.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.996
I'm safe now.

22:10.038 --> 22:11.831
KATHERINE:
Sorry to interrupt.

22:11.873 --> 22:13.750
-I need to borrow him
for a CAT scan.
-For what?

22:13.792 --> 22:15.877
I don't need any more
gamma rays warping my DNA.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.671
I'm not trying to be
Spider-Man over here.

22:17.712 --> 22:19.714
KATHERINE:
The Hulk.

22:19.756 --> 22:22.008
Gamma rays created the Hulk.

22:22.050 --> 22:24.260
Okay.

22:24.302 --> 22:25.512
I will see you later.

22:25.553 --> 22:27.055
Go.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.187
Where's Angela?

22:34.229 --> 22:35.647
The usual nurse.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.273
KATHERINE:
Oh. Went home sick.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.610
Sorry, sir, this patient's
extremely contagious.

22:40.652 --> 22:42.362
Say what now?

22:43.154 --> 22:46.199
I got shot.
I'm not infectious.

22:46.241 --> 22:48.326
Maybe you got the wrong patient.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.537
We need your help.

22:50.578 --> 22:53.873
Oh, hell no.

23:15.687 --> 23:17.939
(engine starts)

23:29.909 --> 23:31.453
Just gonna take a quick look.

23:31.494 --> 23:33.413
CIA. Busy day for you guys.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.165
Your friend just left.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.544
* *

24:00.648 --> 24:02.901
(phone buzzing)

24:06.154 --> 24:08.531
I think I know where
Katherine got that envelope.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.700
-Is it important?
-No idea.

24:10.742 --> 24:12.202
Do you know
if Blake sent anyone else

24:12.243 --> 24:13.745
-over to Solomon's house today?
-Not that I know of.

24:13.787 --> 24:15.872
You think he's got
someone shadowing you?

24:15.914 --> 24:17.874
Wouldn't put it past him.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.417
What'd you find at the plant?

24:19.459 --> 24:22.087
So it services the Capitol
and 22 other buildings.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.214
There's five miles
of tunnel down there.

24:24.255 --> 24:25.548
And...

24:25.590 --> 24:27.342
do we know who has access?

24:27.384 --> 24:29.094
Engineers, service techs,

24:29.135 --> 24:30.970
and three or four
federal agents.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.809
Is the Architect of the Capitol
one of them?

24:36.810 --> 24:38.353
His name's Warren Bellamy.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.233
Yeah.

24:43.274 --> 24:44.776
How'd you know that?

24:44.818 --> 24:46.361
Get me his phone.

24:46.403 --> 24:47.779
Get me everything.

24:47.821 --> 24:48.780
(phone clicks off)

24:48.822 --> 24:51.074
* *

25:10.885 --> 25:12.429
NUÑEZ (whispering):
Are you crazy?

25:12.470 --> 25:13.930
They're looking for you, man.

25:13.972 --> 25:15.432
We wouldn't be here
if we had any other options.

25:15.473 --> 25:17.600
Who's "we," anyway?

25:17.642 --> 25:18.685
I'm Katherine Solomon.

25:18.727 --> 25:20.645
LANGDON:
Peter's daughter.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.980
Nice to meet you.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.273
And-and I-I'm sorry.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.900
-Thanks.
-We don't have a lot of time.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.527
-What do you need from me?
-We need the ring.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.279
From his hand.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.823
The ring. That's evidence.
It's in a locker downtown.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.867
Could you call someone?
Ask to get it released?

25:33.908 --> 25:35.118
Sure, yeah, like takeout.
Maybe get some egg rolls.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.786
You'd have to have someone

25:36.828 --> 25:38.038
go in and sign it out.

25:38.079 --> 25:39.456
We'll have to make do
without it.

25:39.497 --> 25:42.334
Well, we don't have
any other options.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.420
What do you need it for, anyway?

25:45.462 --> 25:49.382
There's this page
from the Old Testament,

25:49.424 --> 25:50.967
the story of Solomon.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.969
We think it's encoded
and that the ring could contain

25:53.011 --> 25:54.804
some type of decryption key...

25:54.846 --> 25:56.306
Yeah, okay, that's fine.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.599
He goes on, doesn't he?

25:57.640 --> 25:59.392
Look.

25:59.434 --> 26:00.977
Sato came to see me earlier.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.312
And you were right,

26:02.354 --> 26:04.731
there's something
she's hiding from us.

26:04.773 --> 26:06.358
I can deal with secrets
to a point,

26:06.399 --> 26:08.777
but I passed that point
when that guy started shooting.

26:11.196 --> 26:12.822
Okay.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.076
We'll need
to head by the cleaners.

26:16.117 --> 26:18.370
I got another uniform there.

26:21.831 --> 26:23.083
Nice ride.

26:23.124 --> 26:24.209
LANGDON:
It belongs to a friend.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.502
NUÑEZ:
Yeah? What's he do?

26:25.543 --> 26:26.795
LANGDON:
Architect.

26:28.713 --> 26:31.216
(Nuñez grunts)

26:33.385 --> 26:35.345
(engine starts)

26:36.346 --> 26:39.015
* *

27:01.079 --> 27:02.580
(distant siren wailing)

27:02.622 --> 27:04.624
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:04.666 --> 27:05.959
NUÑEZ:
Hey.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.711
Here goes nothing.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.796
If I'm not out in 20 minutes,

27:09.838 --> 27:11.840
call the cops.

27:11.881 --> 27:13.675
(door opens)

27:13.717 --> 27:16.261
(Nuñez groans)

27:17.887 --> 27:19.347
(exhales sharply)

27:20.932 --> 27:22.767
(Katherine exhales)

27:24.561 --> 27:26.813
(sighs)

27:27.897 --> 27:29.649
What are you going
to tell your mom?

27:29.691 --> 27:31.192
KATHERINE:
Nothing.

27:32.110 --> 27:34.738
She's finally in
a relatively stable place,

27:34.779 --> 27:37.115
so I, um...

27:37.157 --> 27:39.617
I can't tell her about this.
Not yet.

27:39.659 --> 27:41.995
I should check in at the lab.

27:43.788 --> 27:46.207
And my phone is in a tip jar.

27:47.876 --> 27:49.252
Just pretend it's the '70s.

27:49.294 --> 27:51.421
-Pre-cellular.
-Can it be the '80s?

27:51.463 --> 27:52.714
The '80s...

27:52.756 --> 27:53.757
Yeah. Great music.

27:53.798 --> 27:55.091
By every cultural measure,

27:55.133 --> 27:56.551
the '70s was the better decade.

27:56.593 --> 27:57.802
The films alone...

27:57.844 --> 27:59.679
What?
The '80s had amazing movies.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.056
"E.T.," "Back to the Future,"

28:01.097 --> 28:02.265
-"Willow"...
-Yeah.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.600
I'm talking about
grown-up films.

28:03.641 --> 28:05.852
"Godfather," "Network,"
"Chinatown"...

28:05.894 --> 28:08.313
"Raiders."

28:09.606 --> 28:12.025
"Raiders." "Raiders," okay.

28:12.067 --> 28:13.193
(chuckles softly)

28:13.234 --> 28:15.820
We had a few good months, right?

28:17.155 --> 28:18.823
Before my family exploded

28:18.865 --> 28:20.408
and we got caught
in the blast radius?

28:20.450 --> 28:21.743
Ten and a half.

28:21.785 --> 28:23.953
You had a lot going on.

28:28.416 --> 28:30.377
(Langdon sighs)

28:31.419 --> 28:34.047
Does Dad ever talk
to you about it?

28:37.509 --> 28:38.927
About Zach?

28:40.595 --> 28:42.639
No. You?

28:42.681 --> 28:44.641
No.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.601
I feel like he thinks

28:46.643 --> 28:49.104
I blame him for what happened.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.109
You know, it's hard.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.277
Uh... I didn't know
that was going on.

28:56.319 --> 28:58.154
I'm sorry.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.242
I just want to see him

29:02.283 --> 29:04.369
so I can tell him
it wasn't his fault.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.582
The thought that
I might not get the chance

29:09.624 --> 29:11.334
to tell him that is...

29:11.376 --> 29:13.336
Katherine.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.839
You're gonna get the chance.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.590
I promise.

29:18.633 --> 29:21.553
I just need him to know
that I love him.

29:24.139 --> 29:27.267
It can't end with him
the way it did with Zach.

29:28.727 --> 29:30.687
(distant clamoring)

29:30.729 --> 29:33.148
* *

29:33.189 --> 29:35.650
-(distant thudding)
-(gasps)

29:38.903 --> 29:41.114
(buzzer sounds, lock clanks)

29:45.285 --> 29:46.411
(panting)

29:46.453 --> 29:48.955
(men speaking foreign language,
laughing)

29:52.917 --> 29:55.128
(door clangs shut)

30:00.300 --> 30:02.135
(exhales)

30:07.640 --> 30:09.392
(exhales)

30:21.654 --> 30:23.073
Boo.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.328
Hi.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.330
ZACH:
Special K.

30:30.372 --> 30:33.041
Looking very civilized.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.918
I'm surprised
they even let you in.

30:34.959 --> 30:37.087
KATHERINE:
Robert knew someone

30:37.128 --> 30:40.298
who, uh, helped me
pull some strings.

30:42.175 --> 30:44.344
You're still with that twat?

30:46.096 --> 30:48.765
What happened to your feet?

30:48.807 --> 30:50.767
(soft chuckle)

30:50.809 --> 30:53.144
Well, I was having

30:53.186 --> 30:55.814
some interpersonal issues
in here,

30:55.855 --> 30:59.693
and there was a rumor
I might try to escape.

30:59.734 --> 31:03.279
So the guards made sure
I couldn't.

31:03.321 --> 31:04.781
They can't do this to you.

31:04.823 --> 31:06.157
Why?

31:06.199 --> 31:07.951
Human rights?

31:07.992 --> 31:10.161
You're in the wrong
part of town, K.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.579
We have to get you out of here.

31:11.621 --> 31:13.289
-We?
-Yes.

31:13.331 --> 31:15.333
-(slam hand on table)
-You had your chance!

31:19.504 --> 31:22.549
Dad could have gotten me out
with one phone call.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.511
Instead, I got a letter.

31:27.512 --> 31:31.016
"I won't allow you
to play victim

31:31.057 --> 31:34.227
to circumstances
you alone created."

31:34.269 --> 31:36.813
(laughs bitterly)

31:36.855 --> 31:38.690
Did you hear about that?

31:40.525 --> 31:42.235
(snorts) What am I saying?

31:42.277 --> 31:43.737
You probably helped write it.

31:43.778 --> 31:45.321
No. I didn't agree with him.

31:45.363 --> 31:49.075
Oh, you disagreed.

31:49.117 --> 31:51.119
How bold.

31:52.787 --> 31:55.206
Really stood your ground, I bet.

32:00.837 --> 32:03.548
I'm glad you came.

32:05.133 --> 32:08.178
You can give him
a message for me.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.973
(exhales)

32:12.015 --> 32:14.517
(Zach grunts)

32:16.895 --> 32:20.440
I'm not his son anymore.

32:25.862 --> 32:28.198
(panting)

32:34.079 --> 32:35.705
(tapping on window)

32:35.747 --> 32:38.333
(inhales)

32:40.377 --> 32:42.087
This the one?

32:42.128 --> 32:44.172
Yeah.

32:45.882 --> 32:47.592
Great. I'm-a go lie down now.

32:49.177 --> 32:51.054
(car door opens)

32:51.096 --> 32:52.972
(car door closes)

32:53.014 --> 32:54.974
(panting)

32:55.016 --> 32:57.268
* *

33:26.131 --> 33:28.341
* *

33:41.354 --> 33:43.189
(urn thuds)

33:54.325 --> 33:56.578
* *

34:00.832 --> 34:02.542
(lock clicks)

34:24.981 --> 34:27.192
(electrical buzzing)

34:30.195 --> 34:32.405
* *

34:52.384 --> 34:53.677
What's this?

34:53.718 --> 34:55.553
Hebrew Bible.
Published 1814.

34:55.595 --> 34:58.765
It's in three parts.
The first part is the Torah.

34:58.807 --> 35:02.977
300,000 letters
unchanged in over 2,000 years.

35:03.019 --> 35:05.105
The Jewish tradition
of preserving text

35:05.146 --> 35:06.523
is uncompromising.

35:06.564 --> 35:10.443
If a scribe is found
to have added, subtracted

35:10.485 --> 35:13.363
or altered a letter,
the whole manuscript

35:13.405 --> 35:15.240
is invalidated and buried.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.576
Hmm? Look.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.084
Here.

35:26.126 --> 35:28.586
This entire section--
the Hebrew has been changed.

35:28.628 --> 35:30.505
So, what, the page is fake?

35:31.881 --> 35:32.966
No, doctored.

35:33.008 --> 35:35.385
To hide a message.

35:38.263 --> 35:39.723
Look at it closely.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.933
Can you see anything
unusual about it?

35:42.767 --> 35:44.894
Well, looks normal enough.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.896
All the requisite markings
are here:

35:46.938 --> 35:50.066
the double-headed eagle,
triangle, the...

35:50.108 --> 35:51.651
Oh, wait a minute.

35:51.693 --> 35:54.237
This is supposed to be a yod,

35:54.279 --> 35:56.072
but it's a he.

35:56.114 --> 35:57.449
What?

35:57.490 --> 36:01.327
Yeah, this mark on it.
A jeweler's mistake?

36:06.458 --> 36:08.460
What does that look like to you?

36:10.795 --> 36:12.505
Pi.

36:14.007 --> 36:16.926
That is not a mistake,
it's a cipher.

36:23.141 --> 36:24.392
Pi.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.979
3.1415926...

36:28.021 --> 36:29.230
You memorized pi?

36:29.272 --> 36:30.857
Part of it.

36:30.899 --> 36:32.692
Did a competition
in college once.

36:32.734 --> 36:35.362
Got to the 417th character.

36:35.403 --> 36:36.946
Only 417?

36:36.988 --> 36:38.323
I got hungry.

36:38.365 --> 36:40.283
Okay. So,

36:40.325 --> 36:42.619
starting from there,

36:42.660 --> 36:43.661
first number's three.

36:43.703 --> 36:45.288
Circle the third character.

36:45.330 --> 36:47.457
-Then one, circle the fourth.
-Okay.

36:47.499 --> 36:50.418
Four, circle the eighth.
And so on.

37:00.845 --> 37:05.058
Okay, so we have
14 letters that spell...

37:05.100 --> 37:06.601
BELLAMY:
Let see.

37:10.146 --> 37:12.649
Nothing. It's a jumble.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.901
There must be another step.

37:14.943 --> 37:17.070
One veil lifts
to reveal another.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.072
(phone buzzes)

37:26.538 --> 37:29.124
(phone buzzing)

37:29.165 --> 37:30.959
Do you recognize the number?

37:31.001 --> 37:32.919
No.

37:38.049 --> 37:39.175
H-Hello?

37:39.217 --> 37:41.094
Oh, good, my text worked.

37:41.136 --> 37:43.263
I always send unknown calls
to voice mail, so...

37:43.304 --> 37:44.764
Who is this?

37:44.806 --> 37:46.891
Inoue Sato,
with Central Intelligence.

37:46.933 --> 37:49.019
I'm a friend.
I was hoping to talk to Robert.

37:49.060 --> 37:51.646
Uh, Robert...?

37:51.688 --> 37:53.189
SATO:
We don't have time, Mr. Bellamy.

37:53.231 --> 37:54.441
Peter's in trouble.

37:54.482 --> 37:56.026
I don't want anyone else
getting hurt.

38:02.615 --> 38:04.534
-Hello?
-Langdon.

38:04.576 --> 38:06.536
What do you think you're doing?

38:06.578 --> 38:08.538
I'm trying to help Peter.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.540
You're going
to get yourself hurt.

38:10.582 --> 38:12.375
Or Katherine.

38:13.209 --> 38:16.129
I'm giving you a chance
to come out on your own, or...

38:16.171 --> 38:18.298
Robert?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.466
(sighs)

38:19.507 --> 38:21.426
Let's go.

38:24.721 --> 38:26.556
You just hung up on the CIA.

38:26.598 --> 38:28.475
They're, uh, outside.

38:28.516 --> 38:29.976
Let's go.

38:32.437 --> 38:33.730
(indistinct chatter nearby)

38:33.772 --> 38:35.940
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:35.982 --> 38:38.943
(sighs) Damn. Somebody's coming
through the tunnels.

38:42.614 --> 38:43.907
Is there any other way out?

38:43.948 --> 38:45.408
KATHERINE:
What about this?

38:45.450 --> 38:46.951
BELLAMY:
That's the old conveyor system.

38:46.993 --> 38:49.079
I know. You said it goes
to the other buildings, right?

38:49.120 --> 38:50.997
The system hasn't been
in use for years.

38:51.039 --> 38:54.125
-But does it still work?
-It's worth a shot.

39:01.466 --> 39:03.677
(clanking, whirring)

39:05.970 --> 39:07.972
You want us to go in there?

39:09.182 --> 39:11.935
Robert, it'll be okay.

39:11.976 --> 39:13.645
I'll go first.

39:18.024 --> 39:20.068
* *

39:24.489 --> 39:26.533
In case of emergency.

39:31.329 --> 39:33.540
(sighs)

39:48.638 --> 39:52.308
I'm sorry,
but the library's closed.

39:52.350 --> 39:53.685
SATO:
Where are they?

39:59.691 --> 40:02.193
(clattering)

40:02.235 --> 40:05.071
KATHERINE:
You doing okay back there?

40:05.113 --> 40:06.781
How much further?

40:08.199 --> 40:10.326
It's not far.
I can see the light.

40:10.368 --> 40:12.787
I can't see anything,
my eyes are closed.

40:12.829 --> 40:16.041
Just try to relax
and enjoy the ride.

40:16.791 --> 40:18.793
(clattering stops)

40:22.464 --> 40:24.632
Oh, no.

40:24.674 --> 40:26.217
KATHERINE:
It's okay.

40:27.218 --> 40:28.511
Oh, no.

40:28.553 --> 40:30.138
KATHERINE (distantly):
It's okay.

40:30.180 --> 40:31.973
You'll be okay.

40:32.015 --> 40:35.727
BOY (shouting):
Help me! I'm stuck!

40:35.769 --> 40:36.853
KATHERINE (echoing):
Robert?

40:36.895 --> 40:38.521
BOY:
Help!

40:38.563 --> 40:40.357
KATHERINE:
Robert.

40:40.398 --> 40:41.691
BOY:
Help!

40:41.733 --> 40:43.902
(normal voice):
Robert.

40:47.489 --> 40:49.074
You're okay.

40:50.075 --> 40:51.910
You're okay.

40:55.538 --> 40:56.873
We're gonna crawl.

40:56.915 --> 40:59.668
It's not that far.

41:01.419 --> 41:04.047
-You can do this.
-(shudders)

41:04.089 --> 41:05.590
Okay?

41:26.736 --> 41:28.697
* *

41:28.738 --> 41:30.740
(grunts)

41:32.784 --> 41:34.160
PETER:
Hey, hey! Hey!

41:34.202 --> 41:36.413
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

41:36.454 --> 41:38.164
Stop, hey!

41:38.206 --> 41:39.541
Hey!

41:39.582 --> 41:40.834
Stop.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.293
(distantly):
Hey.

41:42.335 --> 41:44.629
(echoes):
Hey!

41:47.007 --> 41:48.174
(exhales)

41:53.096 --> 41:55.015
(sighs)

41:55.056 --> 41:57.017
(groans)

41:58.393 --> 41:59.978
(groans)

42:10.739 --> 42:12.157
Oh.

42:12.198 --> 42:13.199
Oh, my God.

42:13.241 --> 42:14.909
-Are you hurt?
-No. I'm fine.

42:14.951 --> 42:16.786
I'm good. I'm good.

42:16.828 --> 42:18.288
Okay, um...

42:18.329 --> 42:20.707
I'm gonna go check up ahead,
make sure it's clear.

42:20.749 --> 42:22.667
Yeah.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.680
(breathing deeply)

42:41.394 --> 42:43.438
(phone buzzing)

42:51.654 --> 42:52.864
Hello?

42:52.906 --> 42:54.366
MAL'AKH:
I understand you've picked up

42:54.407 --> 42:56.034
a fellow traveler.

42:57.202 --> 42:58.995
I am doing what you wanted.

42:59.037 --> 43:02.165
You were told to do it alone.

43:02.207 --> 43:05.669
No, I can't have you
distracted by emotions.

43:05.710 --> 43:08.046
Cut her loose.

43:09.130 --> 43:12.384
Or I'll have someone
do it for you.

43:14.636 --> 43:16.888
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

43:24.354 --> 43:26.898
(fly buzzing)

43:42.956 --> 43:45.375
PETER:
Oh, thank God.

43:51.506 --> 43:52.882
Hello?

43:58.054 --> 44:00.682
Can I use your phone, please?

44:00.724 --> 44:03.268
MAN:
I'm afraid not.

44:04.894 --> 44:06.813
There's more to be done.

44:19.159 --> 44:21.327
LANGDON (distorted):
Where is he?

44:22.704 --> 44:25.123
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

44:25.165 --> 44:27.959
MAL'AKH:
Peter is in the Araf.

44:31.004 --> 44:33.840
The borderland between
Heaven and Hell.

44:37.635 --> 44:39.596
Whether he returns to your world

44:39.637 --> 44:41.723
or moves on to the next

44:41.765 --> 44:41.890
will depends on your actions.
