<i> From the ashes</i>
<i> of the Civil War,</i>

00:09.750 --> 00:12.750
<i> a new breed</i>
<i> of American emerges,</i>

00:14.333 --> 00:16.166
<i> determined to grab</i>
<i> a piece</i>

00:16.166 --> 00:18.792
<i> of the nation's</i>
<i> untamed frontier.</i>

00:23.333 --> 00:26.417
Life was tough
certainly after the Civil War.

00:26.417 --> 00:30.750
<i> And you had</i>
<i> this vast continent</i>
<i> that was unexplored.</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:35.250
And I think that fostered
a big migration to the West.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.709
( horse whinnies )

00:37.709 --> 00:40.542
Narrator:
<i> Over the course of 30 years,</i>

00:40.542 --> 00:43.750
<i> more than 430 million</i>
<i> acres of land</i>

00:43.750 --> 00:45.792
<i> will be settled.</i>

00:45.792 --> 00:49.458
<i> But as the US government</i>
<i> pushes the nation west,</i>

00:49.458 --> 00:53.291
<i> former Confederates</i>
<i> hell-bent on taking back</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:56.792
<i> what they lost</i>
<i> become outlaws...</i>

00:56.792 --> 00:59.291
We intend to rob
this here bank.

00:59.291 --> 01:01.583

Narrator:
<i>...threatening to reignite</i>
<i>the Civil War.</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:10.750
In that day, you had
to be somewhat of a bad guy
to survive.

01:10.750 --> 01:12.792
- ( grunts )
- ( gunshot )

01:12.792 --> 01:16.458
They were all tough

01:17.333 --> 01:20.458
Narrator:
<i>On the plains,</i>
<i>war breaks out</i>

01:20.458 --> 01:22.750
<i>as tribes of warriors</i>
<i>band together</i>

01:22.750 --> 01:25.375
<i>to protect</i>
<i>their way of life.</i>

01:25.375 --> 01:28.625
We deploy Custer
and 1,200 men to track down

01:28.625 --> 01:32.333
whatever remains
of Crazy Horse and
Sitting Bull's war party.

01:32.333 --> 01:34.625
<i>If necessary,</i>
<i>wipe them out.</i>

01:35.500 --> 01:36.792
Narrator:
<i>This is the story</i>

01:36.834 --> 01:39.500
<i>of an age of violence</i>
<i>like no other,</i>

01:39.500 --> 01:43.625
<i>a time when blood is shed</i>
<i>and battles fought</i>

01:43.625 --> 01:47.500
-<i> by ordinary men</i>
<i>who become legends...</i>
- ( gunshot )

01:47.542 --> 01:50.583
<i>...as they fight to determine</i>
<i>the fate of the country.</i>

01:51.291 --> 01:53.834
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i>The West shaped this</i>
<i>country in ways</i>

01:53.834 --> 01:56.458
that people either
don't acknowledge or have
taken for granted

01:56.458 --> 01:58.333
or have simply forgotten.

01:58.333 --> 01:59.709
<i>The West</i>
<i>was true freedom.</i>

01:59.750 --> 02:02.625
It was such a defining
characteristic of America.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.709
Narrator:
<i>This is "The American West."</i>

02:05.709 --> 02:08.375

Narrator:
<i>The story of the West</i>
<i>begins at the end</i>

03:13.583 --> 03:15.750
<i>of the Civil War...</i>

03:17.417 --> 03:19.542
<i>where a young man</i>
<i>named Jesse James</i>

03:19.542 --> 03:22.625
<i>is a soldier in a fringe</i>
<i>military group</i>

03:22.625 --> 03:25.500
<i>known as Quantrill's</i>
<i>Raiders.</i>

03:25.500 --> 03:27.542
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i>Quantrill's Raiders</i>
<i>were guerilla fighters</i>

03:27.542 --> 03:29.458
<i>fighting for the South.</i>

03:29.458 --> 03:31.750
<i>They didn't necessarily fight</i>
<i>in traditional ways,</i>

03:31.750 --> 03:35.458
and the way they fought
could often be very savage,
very violent,

03:35.458 --> 03:37.750
and their targets
could be civilians
as well as military.

03:49.667 --> 03:52.458

04:05.917 --> 04:07.792

( gunshot )

04:15.917 --> 04:18.667

( grunts )

04:39.917 --> 04:41.875

04:43.750 --> 04:45.583
Get him!

04:51.500 --> 04:53.625
- ( gunshot )
- ( screams )

04:57.834 --> 05:01.917
- Can you run?

05:03.834 --> 05:05.875
( gunshot )

05:05.875 --> 05:08.625

05:18.750 --> 05:21.917
Narrator:
<i>In the spring of 1865,</i>

05:21.917 --> 05:24.750
<i>Jesse James is shot</i>
<i>and captured</i>

05:24.750 --> 05:26.750
<i>by the Union Army.</i>

05:30.959 --> 05:33.542
- ( squishing )
- ( groaning )

05:34.709 --> 05:37.750
( labored breathing )

05:37.750 --> 05:40.542
Now, say it.

05:45.792 --> 05:48.542
I solemnly swear...

05:48.542 --> 05:50.917
That I will bear
the true allegiance

05:50.917 --> 05:53.417
of the United States.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.709
<i>Say it.</i>

06:01.583 --> 06:03.583
( screams )

06:10.875 --> 06:13.959
I will bear true allegiance
to the United States.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.041
<i>And discourage...</i>

06:16.041 --> 06:18.792
Narrator:
<i>Jesse James is forced</i>
<i>to pledge allegiance</i>

06:18.792 --> 06:21.750
<i>to the Union.</i>

06:21.750 --> 06:25.667
<i>Before he's released,</i>
<i>the Confederacy surrenders</i>

06:25.667 --> 06:28.542
<i>and after four years</i>
<i>of bloody fighting,</i>

06:28.542 --> 06:30.834
<i>the Civil War</i>
<i>comes to an end.</i>

06:39.959 --> 06:43.000
<i>After surviving</i>
<i>a near fatal wound,</i>

06:43.000 --> 06:46.583
<i>Jesse James returns home</i>
<i>to Missouri</i>

06:46.625 --> 06:50.000
<i>only to find death</i>
<i>and destruction all around.</i>

06:51.750 --> 06:54.959
After the Civil War,
the South was hellacious.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.875
It had been ruined.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.834
And there was a great deal
of resentment

06:59.834 --> 07:02.083
of northern authority,
of federal authority.

07:02.083 --> 07:04.917
<i> There were a lot of people</i>
<i> who were mentally unbalanced</i>

07:04.917 --> 07:08.625
<i> by that war,</i>
<i> by the brutality of it.</i>

07:08.625 --> 07:10.667
Narrator:
<i> In the border state</i>
<i> of Missouri,</i>

07:10.667 --> 07:13.709
<i> the fighting has been</i>
<i> especially brutal.</i>

07:13.709 --> 07:15.750
David Eisenbach:
<i> Missouri is one of the states</i>

07:15.750 --> 07:17.917
<i> that stuck with the Union</i>
<i> during the Civil War,</i>

07:17.917 --> 07:20.083
but had large sectors
of the population

07:20.083 --> 07:22.750
that wanted to go with
the South in the first place.

07:22.750 --> 07:27.750
<i> So you had Missourians</i>
<i> fighting Missourians.</i>

07:27.792 --> 07:29.917
<i> It's in this</i>
<i> incredibly volatile,</i>

07:29.959 --> 07:32.792
literally brother
against brother world

07:32.792 --> 07:35.000
<i> that we get Jesse James.</i>

07:43.667 --> 07:45.709
Narrator:
<i> Jesse soon discovers</i>
<i> that the war</i>

07:45.709 --> 07:49.709
<i> has not only torn apart</i>
<i> his homeland,</i>

07:49.709 --> 07:52.041
<i> it's left his family</i>
<i> with nothing.</i>

07:58.001 --> 08:00.750
You look good, Frank.

08:00.750 --> 08:01.875
You look like shit.

08:01.875 --> 08:04.000
( laughs )

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
I bet you gave
them Union boys hell,
though, didn't you?

08:10.125 --> 08:12.792
It's just real nice
to be home.

08:16.709 --> 08:19.125
Mom, I promise you,

08:19.125 --> 08:21.792
<i>we're gonna get back</i>
<i>on our feet.</i>

08:21.792 --> 08:24.792
Me and Frank
will figure out something.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.834
Gardner:
<i>Jesse and his brother Frank</i>

08:26.834 --> 08:29.166
<i>grew up</i>
<i>in rural Missouri.</i>

08:29.166 --> 08:31.792
Their father had gone off
to the gold fields

08:31.792 --> 08:33.917
during the Gold Rush
and had died there.

08:33.917 --> 08:37.083
<i>Jesse's mother, Zerelda James,</i>
<i>was a single parent,</i>

08:37.083 --> 08:39.917
and I think that created
a very, very strong bond

08:39.917 --> 08:41.083
between her
and her children.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.959
Narrator:
<i>Still reeling from</i>
<i>his time in battle,</i>

08:48.959 --> 08:52.875
<i>Jesse knows he has</i>
<i>to find a way to provide</i>
<i>for his family.</i>

08:59.959 --> 09:02.083
<i>So he comes up</i>
<i>with a plan.</i>

09:05.041 --> 09:07.000
<i>He forms a gang...</i>

09:08.750 --> 09:10.834
<i>and begins stealing.</i>

09:13.001 --> 09:15.875
Sutherland:
<i>When you think of Jesse James</i>
<i>and those families,</i>

09:15.875 --> 09:18.125
<i>they have been stripped</i>
<i>of everything, they felt,</i>

09:18.125 --> 09:21.750
after the Civil War
and they were gonna come

09:21.750 --> 09:25.917
and take what they thought
was owed to them.

09:25.917 --> 09:27.750
- Jesse:<i> Come here,</i>
<i>come here.</i>
- Let's go.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.000
Here, take this.

09:34.166 --> 09:35.959
Go, go, go!

09:38.875 --> 09:42.250
Narrator:
<i>But the Union Army</i>
<i>quickly cracks down.</i>

09:45.875 --> 09:48.834
<i>( men shouting )</i>

09:48.834 --> 09:50.250
Jesse.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.208
Cover that up.

09:59.083 --> 10:01.208
How you doing?

10:01.208 --> 10:03.875
What's in the crates?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.208
Food,

10:05.208 --> 10:07.041
various sundries.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.917
<i>Got some sweet corn.</i>

10:15.000 --> 10:17.959
- You boys hungry?
- Want some water.

10:17.959 --> 10:21.083
- We don't take orders
from northern--
- Jesse:<i> Frank!</i>

10:24.208 --> 10:26.001
We got water.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.917
Fresh out of the creek.

10:48.875 --> 10:50.083
Tastes like shit.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.166
<i>( pours water )</i>

10:52.166 --> 10:54.291
Yeah, well, I guess
we're used to it.

10:59.375 --> 11:02.208
Search the house.
Take it all.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.208
Soldier:
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

11:07.000 --> 11:09.959
Narrator:
<i>Fed up with</i>
<i>the North's presence,</i>

11:09.959 --> 11:13.001
<i>Jesse James is determined</i>
<i>to fight back.</i>

11:22.959 --> 11:24.250
( grunts )

11:26.291 --> 11:30.041
Eric Foner:
<i>Jesse James could not</i>
<i>adjust to peacetime.</i>

11:30.041 --> 11:32.291
He was strongly opposed
to what was going on
in the South

11:32.291 --> 11:36.166
and in fact viewed the army
after the end of the war
as being oppressive.

11:37.959 --> 11:39.917
Narrator:
<i> As attacks from</i>
<i> Confederates like Jesse</i>

11:39.917 --> 11:42.000
<i> escalate around the South,</i>

11:43.792 --> 11:47.166
<i> news travels over</i>
<i> 1,000 miles to the east</i>

11:47.166 --> 11:49.166
<i> to the nation's capital.</i>

11:54.208 --> 11:56.208
These just came in.

12:01.959 --> 12:03.959
You're dismissed.

12:06.250 --> 12:09.000
Narrator:
<i>The man who has to deal</i>
<i>with the growing unrest</i>

12:09.000 --> 12:11.333
<i>in the South</i>
<i>is the same man</i>

12:11.333 --> 12:14.417
<i>who recently claimed victory</i>
<i>over the Confederacy--</i>

12:17.291 --> 12:20.083
<i>commanding general</i>
<i>of the US Army</i>

12:20.083 --> 12:22.959
<i>Ulysses S. Grant.</i>

12:22.959 --> 12:25.166
( men shouting )

12:26.333 --> 12:28.333
Narrator:
<i>When the Civil War began,</i>

12:28.333 --> 12:31.959
<i>Grant was considered by many</i>
<i>to be a failure,</i>

12:31.959 --> 12:36.001
<i>a drunk with no future</i>
<i>in the military.</i>

12:36.001 --> 12:38.001
<i>But after a series</i>
<i>of Union generals</i>

12:38.001 --> 12:41.417
<i>were unable to secure victory</i>
<i>for the North,</i>

12:41.417 --> 12:45.125
<i>Abraham Lincoln promoted Grant</i>
<i>to lead the US Army,</i>

12:45.125 --> 12:47.250
<i>and he rose to the task.</i>

12:50.333 --> 12:55.250
John McCain:
<i>General Grant is one</i>
<i>of the true military geniuses.</i>

12:55.250 --> 12:59.375
He saw the objective and he knew
what needed to be done.

13:06.041 --> 13:09.166
Narrator:
<i> With tensions rising</i>
<i> in the former Confederacy,</i>

13:09.166 --> 13:13.333
<i> Grant is forced to deal</i>
<i> with the South once again.</i>

13:13.333 --> 13:15.375
H.W. Brands:
<i> When Grant took control</i>
<i> of the army,</i>

13:15.375 --> 13:19.208
<i> he had to deal</i>
<i> with leftover matters</i>
<i> from the Civil War.</i>

13:19.208 --> 13:22.500
Grant understood that there
was a feeling in the South

13:22.500 --> 13:26.417
that this defeat was something
that still might be resisted.

13:26.417 --> 13:29.083
<i> And Grant had</i>
<i> to attend to that.</i>

13:32.417 --> 13:35.458
Narrator:
<i> Grant knows he can't let</i>
<i> rebels like Jesse James</i>

13:35.458 --> 13:37.417
<i> reignite the war.</i>

13:43.041 --> 13:46.500
<i> So he sends</i>
<i> more US troops south</i>
<i> to maintain order</i>

13:46.500 --> 13:49.375
<i> and institutes</i>
<i> strict martial law.</i>

13:52.417 --> 13:56.041
<i> Just over a year since</i>
<i> the end of the Civil War,</i>

13:56.041 --> 13:59.208
<i> it's North</i>
<i> versus South again.</i>

14:08.125 --> 14:11.333
Narrator:
<i> With former Confederate</i>
<i> soldiers like Jesse James</i>

14:11.333 --> 14:15.041
<i> lashing out against</i>
<i> northern authority</i>
<i> in the South...</i>

14:15.041 --> 14:17.208
<i> ( gunshot )</i>

14:17.208 --> 14:19.375
<i> ...General Ulysses S. Grant</i>
<i> sends armed troops</i>

14:19.375 --> 14:21.125
<i> to enforce order.</i>

14:29.208 --> 14:32.125
Brands:
<i> During the immediate</i>
<i> aftermath of the Civil War,</i>

14:32.125 --> 14:34.542
military government
martial law was imposed

14:34.542 --> 14:38.458
<i> and Union soldiers</i>
<i> were in occupation</i>
<i> of much of the South.</i>

14:40.291 --> 14:42.500
<i> Southerners generally</i>
<i> resisted this.</i>

14:42.500 --> 14:47.083
<i> It was, from their</i>
<i> perspective, a continuation</i>
<i> of the Civil War</i>

14:47.125 --> 14:49.417
in which northerners
imposed their will,

14:49.417 --> 14:51.417
imposed their ways
on the South.

14:52.959 --> 14:55.208
Narrator:
<i> But the increased</i>
<i> military presence</i>

14:58.583 --> 15:00.417
<i> only makes things worse.</i>

15:00.417 --> 15:02.208
<i> Jesse James and other</i>
<i> ex-Confederates like him</i>

15:02.208 --> 15:04.083
<i> begin rioting.</i>

15:04.083 --> 15:06.125
<i> ( men shouting )</i>

15:28.291 --> 15:32.291
Narrator:
<i>With the Civil War on the verge</i>
<i> of starting up again,</i>

15:32.333 --> 15:35.583
<i> Grant knows a new strategy</i>
<i> is needed to heal the nation.</i>

15:37.208 --> 15:39.417
<i> So he</i>
<i> and the US government</i>

15:39.417 --> 15:42.333
<i> look to a plan laid out</i>
<i> by the man who led the country</i>

15:42.333 --> 15:46.625
<i> during the Civil War--</i>
<i> Abraham Lincoln.</i>

15:50.625 --> 15:54.542
<i> Lincoln knew that the key</i>
<i> to healing the country</i>

15:54.542 --> 15:57.166
<i> would be to give</i>
<i> all Americans the promise</i>

15:57.166 --> 15:59.542
<i> of a new start</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

16:05.166 --> 16:08.291
Redford:
<i> The value of going</i>
<i> into uncharted territory,</i>

16:08.291 --> 16:10.542
there's a chance for enterprise
and development

16:10.542 --> 16:14.375
and a chance for people
to grow and to succeed

16:14.375 --> 16:17.583
<i> in ways they couldn't</i>
<i> in the overdeveloped East.</i>

16:17.583 --> 16:19.542
<i> And also, I think,</i>
<i> just the excitement</i>

16:19.542 --> 16:21.667
<i> and the challenge</i>
<i> of uncharted territory--</i>

16:21.667 --> 16:24.500
<i> that's a little bit</i>
<i> of the American way.</i>

16:26.542 --> 16:28.500
Narrator:
<i> From the Missouri River</i>

16:28.500 --> 16:30.542
<i> to the coast</i>
<i> of California,</i>

16:30.542 --> 16:34.542
<i> the frontier is nearly</i>
<i> 500 million square miles</i>

16:34.542 --> 16:36.542
<i> of wide-open land.</i>

16:38.542 --> 16:41.333
Danny Glover:
<i> You have the Pacific Ocean</i>
<i> on one end,</i>

16:41.333 --> 16:44.166
and you have the Atlantic Ocean
on the other end,

16:44.166 --> 16:46.083
and all the vast land
in between that.

16:47.625 --> 16:51.667
<i> It's the whole idea</i>
<i> of looking for opportunity,</i>

16:51.667 --> 16:55.291
<i> looking for another life.</i>

17:02.625 --> 17:05.375
Narrator:
<i> The challenge</i>
<i> is figuring out</i>

17:05.375 --> 17:10.208
<i> how to get people</i>
<i> to the West as quickly</i>
<i> as possible.</i>

17:10.208 --> 17:13.417
<i> And Grant knows the answer.</i>

17:13.417 --> 17:16.583
<i> The same way he was able</i>
<i> to rapidly move Union troops</i>

17:16.583 --> 17:18.542
<i> during the Civil War.</i>

17:20.333 --> 17:22.333
Man:
<i> Whoa, hold up</i>
<i> on that sleeper.</i>

17:22.333 --> 17:24.125
<i> Get to work.</i>

17:25.500 --> 17:26.667
Narrator:
<i> The railroads.</i>

17:26.667 --> 17:29.458
Man:
<i> Hold up on that...</i>

17:29.458 --> 17:31.458
Narrator:
<i> To promote construction,</i>

17:31.458 --> 17:33.458
<i> the government makes</i>
<i> the railroad companies</i>

17:33.500 --> 17:36.333
<i> an unprecedented offer--</i>

17:36.333 --> 17:39.709
<i> millions of acres</i>
<i> of free land.</i>

17:39.709 --> 17:43.417
For every mile of track
that a railroad would build,

17:43.417 --> 17:47.375
<i> Congress would provide</i>
<i> the company with land</i>

17:47.375 --> 17:49.583
<i> on either side</i>
<i> of the track.</i>

17:51.542 --> 17:54.250
<i> The land grants</i>
<i> that Congress provides</i>

17:54.250 --> 17:56.750
really is the sweetheart
deal of the century.

18:00.375 --> 18:02.709
Narrator:
<i> 175 million acres</i>

18:02.709 --> 18:04.667
<i> are given</i>
<i> to the railroad companies--</i>

18:04.667 --> 18:08.291
<i> more land than the entire</i>
<i> state of Texas.</i>

18:11.417 --> 18:14.250
<i> The railroads then take</i>
<i> the land they got for free</i>

18:14.250 --> 18:16.542
<i> and sell it</i>
<i> to the settlers...</i>

18:17.750 --> 18:21.333
<i> using a massive</i>
<i> advertising campaign</i>

18:21.333 --> 18:24.542
<i> that promotes the West</i>
<i> as an uninhabited paradise.</i>

18:26.750 --> 18:29.583
( train whistle blows )

18:29.583 --> 18:32.667
People were lured by this
fantastic sense of opportunity.

18:35.667 --> 18:38.750
<i> You can be a poor immigrant</i>
<i> and all of a sudden</i>

18:38.750 --> 18:42.375
there's an opportunity
that you can get 50 acres
and start a life.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.709
That's like winning
the lottery back then.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.625
I mean, it was amazing.

18:49.625 --> 18:54.709
Narrator:
<i> But as Americans begin to head</i>
<i> west by the thousands...</i>

18:57.333 --> 19:01.500
<i> they're pushing into land</i>
<i> that's already occupied</i>

19:01.500 --> 19:04.208
<i> by a people determined</i>
<i> to defend it.</i>

19:08.667 --> 19:11.542
Narrator:
<i> As railroads expand west,</i>

19:11.542 --> 19:15.333
<i> hopeful new settlers</i>
<i> push into territory</i>

19:15.333 --> 19:18.625
<i> that's been occupied</i>
<i> for thousands of years.</i>

19:24.291 --> 19:27.458
<i> At the end</i>
<i> of the last Ice Age,</i>

19:27.458 --> 19:30.709
<i> nomadic hunters</i>
<i> migrated into the Americas</i>

19:30.709 --> 19:34.834
<i> across a land bridge</i>
<i> that once connected Siberia</i>
<i> to Alaska.</i>

19:37.542 --> 19:39.542
<i> By 1865,</i>

19:39.542 --> 19:43.417
<i> 300,000 Native Americans</i>
<i> are living in the West.</i>

19:46.500 --> 19:50.583
<i> The most numerous and powerful</i>
<i> people on the plains</i>

19:50.583 --> 19:52.583
<i> are the Lakota Sioux.</i>

19:58.500 --> 20:02.709
<i> But now their homelands</i>
<i> are being invaded.</i>

20:04.542 --> 20:08.875
For the Lakota people,
1865 is a major turning point.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.333
<i> With the railroads</i>
<i> coming west,</i>

20:12.333 --> 20:14.375
<i> there is literally</i>
<i> and figuratively</i>

20:14.375 --> 20:16.667
<i> a freight train</i>
<i> coming right at them.</i>

20:21.709 --> 20:24.542
Narrator:
<i> Standing in the path</i>
<i> of the invasion</i>

20:24.542 --> 20:27.542
<i> is a fearless</i>
<i> young warrior.</i>

20:27.542 --> 20:31.792
<i> His name is Crazy Horse.</i>

20:31.792 --> 20:35.834
Andrew Isenberg:
<i> Crazy Horse was a very</i>
<i> talented military leader</i>

20:35.834 --> 20:38.417
who was the chief lieutenant

20:38.417 --> 20:40.750
<i> of the Sioux in the northern</i>
<i> Great Plains.</i>

20:42.583 --> 20:45.458
Narrator:
<i> The land is sacred</i>
<i> to the Lakota</i>

20:45.458 --> 20:48.959
<i> and Crazy Horse feels</i>
<i> it's his duty to defend it.</i>

20:51.917 --> 20:54.750
Redford:
<i> Native Americans,</i>
<i> when they saw the railroad,</i>

20:54.750 --> 20:57.542
<i> they knew that there</i>
<i> was now a vehicle</i>

20:57.542 --> 21:01.750
to invade them with
and it was protected by steel.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.542
And it was fast.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.667
Narrator:
<i> In 1866, Crazy Horse</i>
<i> takes part</i>

21:11.667 --> 21:15.917
<i> in a bloody campaign</i>
<i> throughout the Wyoming</i>
<i> territory.</i>

21:15.917 --> 21:18.542
Sioux in the northern
Great Plains

21:18.542 --> 21:20.792
<i> are fighting against</i>
<i> the settlers who are moving</i>
<i> into that area.</i>

21:20.792 --> 21:22.542
And they're winning.

21:25.542 --> 21:27.917
Narrator:
<i> In the span of six months,</i>

21:27.917 --> 21:31.000
<i> dozens of settlers</i>
<i> are killed</i>

21:31.000 --> 21:34.834
<i> and movement through</i>
<i> the territory is restricted.</i>

21:39.041 --> 21:42.875
<i> News of the violence makes</i>
<i> its way to Washington, DC...</i>

21:42.875 --> 21:45.959
( tapping )

21:45.959 --> 21:50.834
<i> ...where it's received</i>
<i> by the man overseeing</i>
<i> troops in the West,</i>

21:50.834 --> 21:54.875
<i> famed Civil War general</i>
<i> William Tecumseh Sherman.</i>

22:00.709 --> 22:03.000
I just received word
from the Dakota territories.

22:04.667 --> 22:06.667
Another six men have
been killed in a raid.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.667
Narrator:
<i>General Grant knows</i>

22:15.667 --> 22:18.001
<i>he can't let chaos</i>
<i>on the frontier</i>

22:18.001 --> 22:22.542
<i>threaten the government's plan</i>
<i>of unifying the country,</i>

22:22.542 --> 22:25.750
<i>so he orders Sherman</i>
<i>to use military force.</i>

22:27.917 --> 22:29.959
( horse whinnies )

22:31.583 --> 22:33.792
Narrator:
<i>In late 1866,</i>

22:33.792 --> 22:37.709
<i>nearly 1,000 soldiers</i>
<i>pour into Sioux territory.</i>

22:43.959 --> 22:45.959
<i>Crazy Horse knows</i>
<i>it's up to him</i>

22:46.001 --> 22:49.041
<i>to defend his land</i>
<i>and his people</i>

22:49.041 --> 22:52.000
<i>against an enemy</i>
<i>with superior firepower.</i>

22:53.834 --> 22:56.625
<i>But he's confident</i>
<i>he'll prevail,</i>

22:56.625 --> 22:59.875
<i>thanks to a powerful vision</i>
<i>he had in his youth.</i>

23:06.875 --> 23:09.875
Karl Jacoby:
<i>Crazy Horse, as a young man,</i>
<i>had a vision.</i>

23:09.875 --> 23:13.083
<i>( thunder rumbles )</i>

23:13.083 --> 23:15.917
( cawing )

23:15.959 --> 23:19.041
<i>And in this vision</i>
<i>he sees that whenever</i>
<i>he's in battle,</i>

23:19.041 --> 23:22.083
he's very safe
from the enemy and the enemy
can never hurt him.

23:28.792 --> 23:31.792
<i> And in essence</i>
<i> he could be protected</i>

23:31.792 --> 23:33.709
from anything that the enemy
might do to him.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.959
Narrator:
<i> Emboldened by his vision,</i>

23:43.959 --> 23:48.834
<i> Crazy Horse sets in motion</i>
<i> a daring plan.</i>

23:48.834 --> 23:54.667
Jacoby:
<i> Several Lakota are set</i>
<i> to decoy the US Army,</i>

23:54.667 --> 23:58.083
<i> and one of these people</i>
<i> is Crazy Horse.</i>

23:58.083 --> 24:00.667
It's obviously a very risky
position to be in

24:00.667 --> 24:03.792
because you're putting yourself
very close to the US Army.

24:09.001 --> 24:11.166
Narrator:
<i> Crazy Horse lures the soldiers</i>

24:11.166 --> 24:13.834
<i> away from the protection</i>
<i> of their forts</i>

24:13.834 --> 24:15.792
<i> into an open territory.</i>

24:15.792 --> 24:18.917
<i> ( man shouting )</i>

24:26.750 --> 24:28.917
Narrator:
<i> Once he has them</i>
<i> in position,</i>

24:28.917 --> 24:31.208
<i> Crazy Horse begins</i>
<i> his assault.</i>

24:35.041 --> 24:36.834
Man:
<i> Ready!</i>

24:36.834 --> 24:38.959
Narrator:
<i> He charges alone...</i>

24:38.959 --> 24:41.000
Man:
<i> Aim!</i>

24:41.000 --> 24:43.792
Narrator:
<i> ...directly into</i>
<i> their line of fine.</i>

24:43.792 --> 24:45.667
Man:
<i> Fire at will!</i>

24:45.667 --> 24:47.834
( gunshots )

24:56.208 --> 24:59.959
Narrator:
<i> It's a tactic known</i>
<i> as riding the brave line.</i>

25:04.917 --> 25:07.917
<i> And it exposes the soldiers'</i>
<i> greatest weakness.</i>

25:07.917 --> 25:09.959
Man #2:
<i> Reload!</i>

25:09.959 --> 25:12.959
( whooping )

25:12.959 --> 25:15.750
( all whooping )

25:17.959 --> 25:21.041
( soldiers grunting,
screaming )

25:32.875 --> 25:35.041
( whooping )

25:38.125 --> 25:42.041
Narrator:
<i> On December 21, 1866,</i>

25:42.083 --> 25:46.083
<i> Crazy Horse claims</i>
<i>one of his greatest victories--</i>

25:46.083 --> 25:50.041
<i> killing nearly</i>
<i> 100 US soldiers...</i>

25:50.041 --> 25:52.959
<i> in what becomes known</i>

25:52.959 --> 25:55.291
<i> as the Battle</i>
<i> of a Hundred Slain.</i>

26:00.208 --> 26:05.166
<i> Now, in addition</i>
<i> to trying to contain</i>
<i> the southern rebellion,</i>

26:05.166 --> 26:07.750
<i> Grant must deal</i>
<i> with an Indian war</i>

26:07.750 --> 26:10.166
<i> that's beginning</i>
<i> to rage out West,</i>

26:10.166 --> 26:12.959
<i> threatening the future</i>
<i> of the nation.</i>

26:24.792 --> 26:27.000
Narrator:
<i> After Crazy Horse</i>
<i> and his men</i>

26:27.000 --> 26:30.792
<i> kill nearly 100 US soldiers</i>
<i> in a single battle,</i>

26:30.792 --> 26:33.792
<i> news travels back</i>
<i> to Washington.</i>

26:41.834 --> 26:43.917
Incompetence.

26:46.291 --> 26:49.917
These savages,
they don't fight
the way we do.

26:55.208 --> 26:58.001
Narrator:
<i>Commanding general</i>
<i>Ulysses S. Grant</i>

26:58.001 --> 27:01.001
<i>is not only facing</i>
<i>uprisings in the South,</i>

27:01.000 --> 27:03.250
<i>but a new war</i>
<i>in the West.</i>

27:08.291 --> 27:12.208
<i>Grant realizes the only way</i>
<i>to defeat the Indians</i>

27:12.208 --> 27:15.291
<i>is to send his best commander</i>
<i>from the Civil War...</i>

27:19.959 --> 27:23.917
<i>a man stationed 2,000 miles</i>
<i>away in Texas</i>

27:23.917 --> 27:27.166
<i>who's famous</i>
<i>for both his victories</i>

27:27.166 --> 27:30.208
<i>and his unconventional</i>
<i>commanding style.</i>

27:39.166 --> 27:42.291
<i>His name is</i>
<i>George Armstrong Custer.</i>

27:45.125 --> 27:48.834
Anne Collier:
<i>George Armstrong Custer</i>
<i>was very flamboyant.</i>

27:48.834 --> 27:50.333
<i>He had flowing blond hair.</i>

27:50.333 --> 27:52.959
<i>Some say</i>
<i>he curled it himself.</i>

27:52.959 --> 27:56.041
He wore a signature costume,
if you will,

27:56.041 --> 27:57.291
that he called a uniform.

28:01.125 --> 28:04.834
<i> He had a red handkerchief,</i>
<i> shiny boots,</i>

28:04.834 --> 28:06.333
<i> and a broad-rimmed hat.</i>

28:09.041 --> 28:12.083
And he just showed himself
to be superior to others.

28:23.250 --> 28:26.875
Where did you
acquire that insignia
on your uniform, soldier?

28:26.875 --> 28:29.250
West Point, sir.
Fourth in my class.

28:31.125 --> 28:33.917
Fourth
in your class?

28:33.917 --> 28:37.917
Gentlemen, we have
a celebrity in our midst.

28:39.959 --> 28:43.250
Do you know what position
I graduated?

28:43.250 --> 28:45.166
Last.

28:45.166 --> 28:48.417
And yet here I stand
commanding you.

28:50.166 --> 28:53.208
<i>Why is there a button</i>
<i>missing from your coat?</i>

28:58.333 --> 29:00.250
You're a disgrace

29:00.250 --> 29:02.333
to that insignia.

29:02.333 --> 29:05.250
You are a disgrace
to my unit.

29:05.250 --> 29:10.166
And you are a disgrace
to every man who ever
wore that uniform.

29:15.917 --> 29:18.041
One month laundry duty.

29:20.166 --> 29:22.166
Make it the end
of the year.

29:30.333 --> 29:34.375
Narrator:
<i>Though Custer is not</i>
<i>the army's most beloved leader,</i>

29:34.375 --> 29:37.001
<i>he is respected</i>
<i>for the killer instincts</i>

29:37.001 --> 29:39.041
<i>he showed</i>
<i>during the Civil War.</i>

29:39.041 --> 29:40.458
<i>( cannonball whistling )</i>

29:43.208 --> 29:45.083
Cover their left flank!

29:45.083 --> 29:46.959
Narrator:
<i>It was his daring charge</i>

29:46.959 --> 29:49.333
<i>that contributed</i>
<i>to Robert E. Lee's surrender.</i>

29:51.208 --> 29:53.291
Lieutenant, why are you
falling back?

29:53.291 --> 29:56.083
You breach
their front lines
and you push.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.333
Burt Reynolds:
<i>A lot of people</i>
<i>laughed at him,</i>

30:01.333 --> 30:03.125
but not in battle.

30:03.125 --> 30:06.001
<i> He was a hell</i>
<i> of a soldier.</i>

30:06.001 --> 30:08.333
<i> Tremendous courage.</i>

30:08.333 --> 30:11.001
<i> The thing that scared</i>
<i> people half to death</i>

30:11.001 --> 30:12.458
<i> was being assigned to him</i>

30:12.458 --> 30:15.291
'cause you were gonna be
in the middle of everything.

30:15.291 --> 30:17.417
<i> ( men shouting )</i>

30:22.458 --> 30:25.125
Narrator:
<i> But since the Civil War ended,</i>

30:25.125 --> 30:28.291
<i> Custer has been relegated</i>
<i> to overseeing border patrol</i>

30:28.291 --> 30:30.458
<i> at a remote post.</i>

30:30.458 --> 30:32.375
Custer was sent
into exile.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.458
<i> He brooded over this,</i>
<i> of course.</i>

30:35.458 --> 30:39.041
<i> And he knew that he needed</i>
<i> to get back into action.</i>

30:44.001 --> 30:45.250
Sir.

31:11.417 --> 31:14.000
Narrator:
<i>Grant gives him</i>
<i>the opportunity</i>

31:14.000 --> 31:16.166
<i>he's been waiting for.</i>

31:19.291 --> 31:22.291
Hutton:
<i>Custer got command</i>
<i>of the 7th Cavalry,</i>

31:22.291 --> 31:26.041
which was going to be
the crack elite unit

31:26.041 --> 31:28.291
for Indian fighting
in the West.

31:31.417 --> 31:34.166
Narrator:
<i>George Custer</i>

31:34.166 --> 31:37.375
<i>to step back</i>
<i>into the limelight.</i>

31:37.375 --> 31:40.333
<i>And it's an assignment</i>
<i>that will change the course</i>

31:40.333 --> 31:42.417
<i>of American history.</i>

31:48.166 --> 31:50.458
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

31:50.458 --> 31:53.458

<i>former Confederate soldier</i>
<i>Jesse James</i>

31:56.375 --> 31:58.542
<i>has been leading</i>

31:58.542 --> 32:01.333
Jesse:<i> All right, boys,</i>
<i>I'll tell you what's</i>
<i>going to happen.</i>

32:01.333 --> 32:03.500
<i>Me, Charlie, and Frank</i>
<i>will head inside.</i>

32:08.417 --> 32:12.375
Get around that counter,
easy money.

32:17.208 --> 32:20.291
Narrator:
<i>Until now, Jesse's crimes</i>
<i>have been small.</i>

32:22.500 --> 32:26.458
<i>But as the North's</i>
<i>postwar domination of</i>
<i>the South continues...</i>

32:29.166 --> 32:31.250
<i>Jesse is starting</i>
<i>to think bigger.</i>

32:35.250 --> 32:39.583
<i>He decides that</i>
<i>the best way to express</i>
<i>his hatred for the North</i>

32:39.583 --> 32:42.250
<i>is to go after</i>
<i>their wealth.</i>

32:46.333 --> 32:49.583
<i>In the first 80 years</i>
<i>of America's existence,</i>

32:49.583 --> 32:52.542
<i>there was not a single</i>
<i>armed bank robbery.</i>

32:54.250 --> 32:58.250
<i>So at the time,</i>
<i>banks have minimal security.</i>

32:58.250 --> 33:00.208
<i>And even in the South,</i>

33:00.250 --> 33:02.333
<i>they hold mostly</i>
<i>northern money.</i>

33:04.458 --> 33:07.667
<i>Rob a bank</i>
<i>and you're stealing</i>
<i>northern wealth.</i>

33:11.500 --> 33:14.417
Sutherland:
<i>Jesse James wanted</i>
<i>the money,</i>

33:14.417 --> 33:17.417
<i>but he had a real statement</i>
<i>he was trying to make</i>

33:17.417 --> 33:20.625
that was as much political
as it was about robbing banks.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.333
( people chatting )

34:07.667 --> 34:09.417
Go.

34:16.583 --> 34:18.750
- Everything in your vault.
-<i> ( people screaming )</i>

34:18.750 --> 34:20.667
Open the vault.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.709
- Move.
- ( gasps )

34:22.709 --> 34:25.458
- Open the vault.
- Jesse:<i> Hold on, hold on.</i>

34:31.667 --> 34:33.667
In the corner now.

34:38.291 --> 34:39.834
I know you.

34:41.625 --> 34:43.291
<i>Where'd you fight?</i>

34:43.291 --> 34:45.542
- I didn't.
- You did.

34:45.542 --> 34:47.542
You fought for the Union,
didn't you?

34:47.542 --> 34:49.542
No.

34:49.542 --> 34:54.333
Let's open the vault,
be on our way.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.333
- You fought at Richmond.
- No, I didn't.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.583
- Don't you shake
your head at me.
- Jesse.

35:02.458 --> 35:04.667
You're the man who shot
Bill Anderson.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.542
Gardner:
<i>The Civil War</i>
<i>made Jesse James.</i>

35:08.542 --> 35:11.458
<i>He killed men,</i>
<i>he saw men killed.</i>

35:11.458 --> 35:16.709
Seeing death every day changes
the way you look at life.

35:16.709 --> 35:19.333
<i> Jesse mistook</i>
<i> the teller</i>

35:19.333 --> 35:22.625
<i> for the murderer</i>
<i> of his leader during</i>
<i> the Civil War.</i>

35:22.625 --> 35:24.834
I found you,
you son of a bitch.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.333
( shouts )

35:30.333 --> 35:31.750
We still need him
to open the vault.

35:36.375 --> 35:38.333
Bill Anderson
was my friend.

35:38.333 --> 35:39.750
( gunshot )

35:39.750 --> 35:42.542
God damn it, Jesse.
On the floor!

35:46.542 --> 35:48.375
Frank:
<i>Come on, Jesse,</i>
<i>we got to go.</i>

35:48.375 --> 35:49.792
<i>Come on, now!</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

35:51.375 --> 35:53.333
Gardner:
<i>That revolver shot</i>

35:53.333 --> 35:54.750
<i>is somewhat of a release.</i>

35:56.834 --> 35:59.375
When Jesse fires that gun,

35:59.375 --> 36:03.542
there's a welled-up bitterness
that's been boiling for years.

36:03.542 --> 36:06.834
<i>He still has the memories</i>
<i>he witnessed personally</i>
<i>during the war.</i>

36:06.875 --> 36:08.792
<i>Lots of his friends</i>
<i>have been killed.</i>

36:10.500 --> 36:11.834
Jesse refused to forget.

36:11.834 --> 36:14.709
<i>A lot of his makeup</i>
<i>was revenge.</i>

36:16.417 --> 36:17.709
Come on, Jesse.
We got to go.

36:17.750 --> 36:19.583
Jesse, come on.
Come on, now.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.500
Get, boys, get.

36:34.875 --> 36:36.500
( clicks tongue )
Come on.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.583
Come on.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.875
( hammer clicks,
gunshot )

36:55.875 --> 36:58.417
Narrator:
<i>Jesse James</i>
<i>has just pulled off</i>

36:58.417 --> 37:00.667
<i>one of the first</i>
<i>bank robberies in America,</i>

37:00.667 --> 37:04.583
<i>leaving one man dead</i>
<i>and earning the ex-Confederate</i>

37:04.583 --> 37:06.667
<i>his first victory</i>
<i>against the North.</i>

37:06.667 --> 37:08.834
A lot of the guys
who became outlaws,

37:08.834 --> 37:11.917
Jesse James and so forth,
they were all part of
the Confederate Army.

37:11.917 --> 37:14.583
<i> And when the Union</i>
<i> won that war,</i>

37:14.583 --> 37:16.583
robbing banks
was their way

37:16.583 --> 37:19.875
of continuing the fight
of the Confederacy.

37:19.875 --> 37:22.792
Narrator:
<i> The crime makes headlines</i>
<i> across the state,</i>

37:22.792 --> 37:26.542
<i> turning Jesse</i>
<i> into a wanted criminal.</i>

37:26.542 --> 37:28.500
All right,
it's on you, Frank.

37:28.500 --> 37:30.458
There it is.
( laughs )

37:30.458 --> 37:34.750
It's a good day
to be Frank James,
you know.

37:34.750 --> 37:37.667
Sutherland:
<i>Jesse James certainly had</i>
<i>a very specific idea.</i>

37:37.667 --> 37:40.917
He was going to take the money
that he felt was taken from him
during the Civil War.

37:40.917 --> 37:43.583
<i> The press</i>
<i> got wind of that.</i>

37:43.583 --> 37:46.458
And once they started
reading their own stuff,

37:46.458 --> 37:48.625
they were, "Yeah, I'm right.
You know, I was questioning

37:48.625 --> 37:51.458
whether or not I should have
robbed that bank, but now
I know I'm right."

37:51.458 --> 37:52.834
( laughs )

37:52.834 --> 37:54.917
Narrator:
<i>With his reputation growing,</i>

37:54.917 --> 37:58.792
<i>Jesse James is fanning</i>
<i>the flames of rebellion</i>
<i>in the South.</i>

38:01.875 --> 38:04.500
<i>Over 400 miles away,</i>

38:04.500 --> 38:07.583
<i>the US government is dealing</i>
<i>with an even greater problem</i>

38:07.583 --> 38:09.709
<i>than southern uprisings...</i>

38:12.583 --> 38:15.709
<i>as Indian attacks</i>
<i>by warriors like Crazy Horse</i>

38:15.709 --> 38:18.001
<i>are slowing down</i>
<i>western progress.</i>

38:22.959 --> 38:25.917
<i> But General</i>
<i> Ulysses S. Grant</i>
<i> has an answer--</i>

38:25.917 --> 38:29.959
<i> Civil War hero</i>
<i> George Armstrong Custer.</i>

38:33.792 --> 38:37.959
Grant was quite happy
with the performance of Custer.

38:38.001 --> 38:43.709
<i> Custer was one</i>
<i> of the great heroes</i>
<i> during the Civil War.</i>

38:43.709 --> 38:45.959
<i> He was also willing to do</i>
<i> whatever was necessary</i>

38:45.959 --> 38:48.792
to deal with the Indian issue
right now.

38:50.709 --> 38:52.750
Narrator:
<i> For Custer,</i>
<i> it's the opportunity</i>

38:52.750 --> 38:56.041
<i> he's been waiting for to step</i>
<i> back into the spotlight.</i>

39:02.667 --> 39:05.750
<i> For months, Custer has been</i>
<i> hunting bands of Indians</i>

39:05.750 --> 39:07.542
<i> across</i>
<i> the southern plains...</i>

39:07.542 --> 39:09.959
Halt!

39:09.959 --> 39:12.625
<i>...but hasn't been able</i>
<i>to track them down.</i>

39:19.000 --> 39:21.834
Gardner:
<i>I think Custer had</i>
<i>the same ambitions</i>

39:21.834 --> 39:24.792
that any long-term
military officer had.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.792
That was to advance
in rank.

39:26.792 --> 39:30.917
<i> Advance in rank</i>
<i> and to win laurels,</i>
<i> win glory.</i>

39:30.917 --> 39:34.792
<i> That was hard to do</i>
<i> in the post-Civil War West.</i>

39:34.792 --> 39:37.001
<i> I mean, you weren't meeting</i>
<i> a foe that was lined up</i>

39:37.001 --> 39:39.792
with 10,000 men
on the field of battle.

39:39.792 --> 39:42.709
You were meeting
a very elusive foe.

39:42.709 --> 39:45.875
<i> So I think Custer</i>
<i> was frustrated often</i>

39:45.875 --> 39:49.709
<i> with what he wanted to do,</i>
<i> and I think he wanted glory.</i>

39:54.959 --> 39:58.750
Narrator:
<i> Finally, Custer</i>
<i> catches a break.</i>

40:14.917 --> 40:18.917
<i> His regiment discovers</i>
<i> a band of Cheyenne Indians</i>

40:18.917 --> 40:20.917
<i> camped near</i>
<i> the Washita River</i>

40:20.917 --> 40:24.834
<i> suspected of attacking</i>
<i> settlers and troops.</i>

40:26.041 --> 40:28.000
Get the men ready.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.875
Half an hour.

40:30.917 --> 40:34.041
I want to hit them
with everything we've got.

40:37.667 --> 40:39.041
You have your orders.

40:39.041 --> 40:41.001
Yes, sir.

40:50.834 --> 40:53.750
Narrator:
<i>Desperate for another</i>
<i>chance at greatness,</i>

40:53.750 --> 40:56.625
<i>Custer prepares</i>
<i>a surprise attack.</i>

41:01.041 --> 41:04.083
Jacoby:
<i>Custer is quite consciously,</i>
<i>I think, very aggressive</i>

41:04.125 --> 41:06.709
<i>in his war against Indians</i>

41:06.709 --> 41:08.959
because he's really trying
to reclaim the glory

41:08.959 --> 41:10.792
that he experienced
during the Civil War

41:10.792 --> 41:13.625
<i> when he was</i>
<i> this American hero.</i>

41:24.125 --> 41:27.834
Narrator:
<i> It's only been three years</i>
<i> since the Civil War ended.</i>

41:31.083 --> 41:34.750
<i> But now with Custer</i>
<i> riding into a battle</i>
<i> for glory...</i>

41:38.709 --> 41:41.667
<i> and Jesse James inciting</i>
<i> a rebellion in the South...</i>

41:43.917 --> 41:48.542
<i> America is on the brink</i>
<i> of fighting a two-front war.</i>
