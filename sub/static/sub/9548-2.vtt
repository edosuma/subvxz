WEBVTT

00:03.512 --> 00:06.379
Payable to Natalie.

00:06.449 --> 00:10.943
Teeger.

00:11.020 --> 00:13.545
My four favorite words.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.595 --> 00:53.823
Thank you.

00:53.896 --> 00:55.420
Thank you very much.

00:56.766 --> 00:58.734
Um...

00:58.801 --> 01:00.701
Excuse me.
Where's the rest of it?

01:00.770 --> 01:03.796
I worked Tuesday night.
Remember? That was overtime.

01:03.873 --> 01:05.238
Oh?

01:05.308 --> 01:07.833
I thought you were
just hanging out.

01:07.910 --> 01:10.310
No. Mr. Monk,
I wasn't just hanging out.

01:10.379 --> 01:13.507
I spent seven hours
reorganizing the utensil drawer.

01:13.582 --> 01:15.072
That was work.

01:15.151 --> 01:17.642
But you said it was fun.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.280
I distinctly remember that.

01:20.356 --> 01:24.622
I said, "Isn't this fun?"
And you said, "Uh-huh."

01:25.861 --> 01:27.123
So...

01:27.630 --> 01:30.531
You mean unless I'm complaining,
you're not going to pay me?

01:30.599 --> 01:33.295
Is that the new rule?

01:33.369 --> 01:37.100
Even if I wanted to.
I've already torn it out of the checkbook.

01:37.173 --> 01:39.471
Yeah. So, you
just void it out.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.476
Void. Write "void." And then,
you just write another one.

01:41.544 --> 01:43.512
Natalie.

01:43.579 --> 01:46.377
I can't do that.
I wish I could.

01:46.449 --> 01:48.713
If it were up to me...
Of course it's up to you.

01:48.784 --> 01:50.718
I need you to use your inside voice.
What?

01:50.786 --> 01:52.515
Oh, my God!
All right.

01:52.588 --> 01:53.646
God!

01:53.723 --> 01:56.157
I'm a little short of
cash right now. Okay?

01:56.225 --> 01:58.887
But I'm good for it.
You know I'm good for it. Just keep track.

01:58.961 --> 02:01.862
Yeah. I have been keeping track.
It's over $1,800, Mr. Monk.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.695
I'm sorry.
The door was open.

02:06.769 --> 02:08.133
I thought I heard screaming.

02:08.204 --> 02:09.637
Oh, no. That was just me.

02:09.705 --> 02:11.195
I scream every payday.

02:11.273 --> 02:12.535
Can I help you?

02:12.608 --> 02:14.542
My name is Linda Kloster.

02:14.610 --> 02:16.202
My husband is Patrick Kloster.

02:16.278 --> 02:19.475
Patrick. The chess player.
I was just reading about him.

02:19.548 --> 02:22.813
He's some sort of super genius.
Like, off the charts.

02:22.885 --> 02:25.752
Yes. Patrick has
an I.Q. Of 180.

02:25.821 --> 02:27.686
Four points higher
than Albert Einstein's.

02:27.757 --> 02:29.952
What can I do for you?

02:30.026 --> 02:32.756
Well, it's my husband.
He's going to kill someone.

02:33.629 --> 02:34.926
How do you know?

02:34.997 --> 02:36.988
He told me. He talks
about it all the time.

02:37.066 --> 02:39.557
He says he has a perfect plan.
He says it's foolproof,

02:39.635 --> 02:41.227
and that he'll
never get caught.

02:41.303 --> 02:43.294
Did he say who
he's going to kill?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.430
Yes.

02:45.641 --> 02:46.903
It's me.

02:48.444 --> 02:50.344
He's going to kill me.

02:53.983 --> 02:56.417
It's a jungle out there

02:56.485 --> 03:00.854
Disorder and
confusion everywhere

03:00.923 --> 03:03.050
No one seems to care

03:03.125 --> 03:04.217
Well, I do

03:04.293 --> 03:07.262
Hey, who's in charge here?

03:07.329 --> 03:10.992
It's a jungle out there

03:11.067 --> 03:14.298
Poison in the very
air we breathe

03:14.370 --> 03:16.736
You know what's in the
water that you drink?

03:16.806 --> 03:17.795
Well, I do

03:17.873 --> 03:21.070
It's amazing

03:21.143 --> 03:22.576
People think I'm crazy

03:22.645 --> 03:24.442
'cause I worry
all the time

03:24.513 --> 03:27.641
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

03:27.716 --> 03:29.047
You better pay attention

03:29.118 --> 03:31.814
Or this world
we love so much

03:31.887 --> 03:35.687
might just kill you

03:35.758 --> 03:37.953
I could be wrong now

03:38.027 --> 03:39.824
But I don't think so

03:39.895 --> 03:42.523
'Cause there's a
jungle out there

03:42.598 --> 03:44.327
It's a jungle out there

03:50.606 --> 03:53.336
Can I get you something to drink?
We have some wine.

03:53.409 --> 03:56.708
Oh, no. Thank you.
I'm three years sober.

03:56.779 --> 03:57.939
Well, three years
and two months.

03:58.013 --> 03:59.037
Congratulations.

03:59.115 --> 04:04.747
Mrs. Kloster, isn't it possible
that you misunderstood your husband?

04:04.820 --> 04:07.152
Patrick is not
an ambiguous man.

04:07.223 --> 04:11.751
He said he's going to kill me.
In fact, he tells me every day.

04:11.827 --> 04:13.124
As I'm going to
bed, he'll say,

04:13.195 --> 04:15.720
"Goodnight, sweetheart.
It won't be long, now."

04:17.700 --> 04:19.257
Why don't you
go to the police?

04:19.334 --> 04:21.269
I can't prove anything,
and he knows it.

04:21.337 --> 04:22.770
It will be his word
against mine.

04:22.838 --> 04:24.601
Well, can't you leave?
Go someplace?

04:24.673 --> 04:27.369
You mean hide?
From Patrick?

04:27.443 --> 04:30.412
Lmpossible. He'd find
me in two minutes.

04:30.479 --> 04:33.539
He's a chess grand master.
The best in the world.

04:33.616 --> 04:35.550
He can anticipate
my every move.

04:35.618 --> 04:37.279
Murdering me is going
to make him a fortune.

04:37.353 --> 04:40.288
He's taken out a 10-million-dollar
insurance policy on my life.

04:40.356 --> 04:41.846
Did he say when he'd...

04:41.924 --> 04:44.119
No. But it will be soon.

04:44.193 --> 04:47.754
And when he left this morning,
the way he kissed me...

04:47.830 --> 04:50.355
It was different.
You know, the way he smiled.

04:50.432 --> 04:51.421
It's definitely coming.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.990
Where is he now?

04:53.068 --> 04:56.504
He's playing a tournament in Vancouver.
I've been following it.

04:56.572 --> 04:59.473
That's right. He's in
Canada until Tuesday.

04:59.542 --> 05:01.840
Well, at least you're
safe until then.

05:01.911 --> 05:03.776
Am I?

05:03.846 --> 05:06.440
Mrs. Kloster, I have
friends at the department.

05:06.515 --> 05:09.109
Oh, I really appreciate
that, Mr. Monk.

05:09.185 --> 05:11.119
But the police
can't protect me.

05:11.187 --> 05:13.553
Patrick is smarter than
all of them put together.

05:13.622 --> 05:17.058
My husband is going to murder me.
I'm already dead.

05:17.126 --> 05:20.357
And there's nothing you
or anyone can do about it.

05:20.829 --> 05:23.627
Here's a check for $5,000.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.826
I'm a little confused.

05:25.901 --> 05:28.802
If you don't think
he can be stopped...

05:28.871 --> 05:31.840
I'm hiring you, to catch him.

05:31.907 --> 05:34.341
You mean after...
That's right.

05:34.410 --> 05:37.038
After he's killed me.

05:37.112 --> 05:40.878
Mr. Monk, you are the only man
smart enough in this world

05:40.950 --> 05:43.942
to make him pay
for what he did.

05:44.019 --> 05:46.453
Or rather, what
he's going to do.

05:48.190 --> 05:49.555
I can't...

05:50.593 --> 05:52.618
I don't know what to say.

05:55.698 --> 06:00.260
Say yes, Mr. Monk.
Promise me.

06:00.336 --> 06:03.362
Promise me you won't
let him get away with it.

06:07.376 --> 06:08.707
I promise.

06:14.483 --> 06:17.680
Once again,
Kloster is on the attack.

06:17.753 --> 06:21.621
His dynamic style of play has
certainly been on display today.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.756
Your sister called again.

06:24.827 --> 06:27.762
She's worried about you.
Frankly, so am I.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.430
Looks like
he's winning again.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.492
I'm sure he is.

06:34.570 --> 06:35.628
Is the house alarm on?

06:35.704 --> 06:37.968
Yes. I set it myself.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.234
You'll check it again
before you leave?

06:39.308 --> 06:41.139
I always do.

06:50.819 --> 06:52.810
Don't open the
door for anyone.

06:52.888 --> 06:54.856
Make sure Michael knows.

06:57.259 --> 06:59.056
Let me make you some lunch.

06:59.128 --> 07:04.225
You know, I think I'm just going
to take a bath and maybe lie down.

07:04.300 --> 07:07.599
I'm going to make you a
sandwich I'll be right back.

07:14.510 --> 07:16.137
How does she look?

07:16.211 --> 07:17.803
Scared to death.

07:17.880 --> 07:19.973
Of what? The son of
a bitch is in Canada.

07:20.049 --> 07:21.710
I don't blame her.

07:23.285 --> 07:26.777
What she needs is a good
therapist. They both do.

07:27.756 --> 07:29.656
I'm happy I'm not a genius.

07:29.725 --> 07:32.489
It screws with your head.

07:32.561 --> 07:36.122
You want to do her a favor?
Put a little scotch in there.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.161
And it's another
victory for Patrick Kloster.

07:43.572 --> 07:45.767
We didn't have
any green tea.

07:46.575 --> 07:48.805
But I found some Earl Grey.

07:53.115 --> 07:54.878
Kevin, it's a
restraining order.

07:54.950 --> 07:57.145
You issue 30 of them a day.

07:57.219 --> 07:59.949
No, he hasn't hit her, I...

08:00.022 --> 08:02.252
Yes, she's still in the house.

08:03.826 --> 08:07.421
Because Adrian Monk told me.
That's how I know.

08:07.496 --> 08:10.590
Fine. Good. You do that.
You sleep on it. Good.

08:13.369 --> 08:15.462
How did that go?

08:15.537 --> 08:16.526
Forget about him. Look,

08:16.605 --> 08:19.199
just get a cruiser out there.
Park it out front until further notice.

08:19.274 --> 08:21.674
You got it.
You can't arrest him for anything?

08:21.744 --> 08:24.577
Well, apparently, there's no law
against giving your wife the willies.

08:24.646 --> 08:26.580
Captain, we just got a call.

08:26.648 --> 08:27.945
Okay.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.317
You'd better put down
the cup.

08:30.386 --> 08:31.375
Just tell me who
called, Randy.

08:31.453 --> 08:33.943
Just put the cup down or
finish it or drink half of it.

08:34.022 --> 08:35.683
Why?
Because you're

08:35.758 --> 08:38.283
probably going to drop it and I'm
going to have to clean it up and...

08:38.360 --> 08:40.760
Just have a sip.
How about a sip?

08:44.967 --> 08:47.800
Linda Kloster's dead.
Her housekeeper just found her.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.569
What happened?
I don't know. I...

08:53.642 --> 08:55.166
Let's go.
Wait. Mr. Monk!

08:55.244 --> 08:57.576
Let's go! We've got
to get over there.

08:57.646 --> 08:58.806
Let's go, Randy.

09:15.731 --> 09:18.097
Hey. The cavalry is here.

09:18.167 --> 09:19.896
Could I have the room, please?

09:19.968 --> 09:23.062
You heard the man.
He wants the room. Let's go.

09:28.744 --> 09:30.575
Thank you very much.

09:59.107 --> 10:01.405
Mr. Monk.
Not now.

10:01.477 --> 10:02.637
Not now.

10:02.711 --> 10:03.973
You can't blame yourself.

10:05.948 --> 10:07.347
Yes, I can.

10:22.998 --> 10:25.558
What did the paramedics say?

10:25.634 --> 10:27.033
Probable heart attack.

10:31.974 --> 10:33.498
He killed her.

10:35.477 --> 10:38.310
He said he would kill her.
And he did it.

10:39.047 --> 10:40.173
Okay.

10:40.883 --> 10:42.510
Okay. There was no alarm.

10:42.584 --> 10:46.042
There was no one in the house.
Just the housekeeper and the cook.

10:46.121 --> 10:48.555
No signs of trauma
or suffocation.

10:50.158 --> 10:51.420
Poison.

10:51.493 --> 10:54.018
No. Housekeepers said
she hadn't eaten all day.

10:54.096 --> 10:55.723
Breakfast, lunch.

10:56.999 --> 10:58.796
So, how did he do it?

11:02.237 --> 11:03.727
I don't know.

11:05.641 --> 11:07.131
I don't know.

11:10.112 --> 11:11.340
Is he here?

11:11.413 --> 11:13.404
The plane just landed.
What have you got?

11:13.482 --> 11:15.473
You're not going to like it.

11:15.551 --> 11:18.384
The ME said natural causes.
Severe cardiac arrest.

11:18.453 --> 11:21.047
What?
He's already released the body.

11:22.357 --> 11:23.483
What...

11:23.559 --> 11:25.993
What about a complete
toxicology work-up?

11:26.061 --> 11:28.029
He won't do it, Monk.
Not without probable cause.

11:28.096 --> 11:30.997
But she, she was
42 years old!

11:31.066 --> 11:33.534
What about the water?
The tap water in the bathroom.

11:33.602 --> 11:36.127
Checked.
Well, how about her lipstick?

11:36.204 --> 11:38.331
We checked that, too.
I mean, the toothpaste.

11:38.407 --> 11:40.773
Even her eye drops. Everything in the house.
It's all, it's all clean.

11:40.842 --> 11:43.470
He killed her.
He poisoned her.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.035
But how?

11:45.113 --> 11:47.775
There he is.
You can ask him yourself.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.019
Mr. Kloster?
How do you feel?

11:52.087 --> 11:55.716
How do I feel?
I'm still in shock.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.623
Linda was my
reason for living.

11:59.227 --> 12:02.822
"Thou detestable maw,
thou womb of death,

12:03.932 --> 12:06.992
"Gorg'd with the dearest
morsel of the earth."

12:07.069 --> 12:08.900
Where is that from?

12:09.237 --> 12:11.102
Look it up.
Dr. Kloster.

12:11.173 --> 12:12.936
I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
SFPD.

12:13.008 --> 12:14.339
This is Lieutenant Disher.

12:14.409 --> 12:16.570
Are you surprised
to see us, sir?

12:16.945 --> 12:18.810
Yes. I am.

12:19.448 --> 12:23.851
I mean, I'm surprised to see you here.
I expected you in Vancouver.

12:23.919 --> 12:26.183
Yeah, well, we
couldn't afford it.

12:26.254 --> 12:28.722
Look. We're sorry
for your loss, sir.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.588
This is Adrian Monk.
And Natalie Teeger.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.025
Of course.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.729
The legendary Mr. Monk.

12:37.332 --> 12:39.527
I was hoping to see you here.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.104
Hello.

12:43.171 --> 12:46.231
Sir, we were wondering
if you would come downtown

12:46.308 --> 12:47.673
and give us a statement.

12:47.743 --> 12:50.075
I'm afraid my schedule
is rather tight.

12:50.145 --> 12:54.741
But I did take the opportunity of
phoning ahead and reserving a room.

12:54.816 --> 12:58.183
Here. At the airport
security offices.

13:00.188 --> 13:04.716
It's nothing extravagant,
but there is a table. And five chairs.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.892
How did you know
there would be five of us?

13:08.964 --> 13:11.558
Please, Miss Teeger.
Don't insult me.

13:22.911 --> 13:28.907
According to the Vancouver police,
they interrupted the match at 1:21 p.m.

13:28.984 --> 13:30.246
To inform you that
your wife had died.

13:30.318 --> 13:31.580
That's right.

13:31.653 --> 13:34.486
And they said you kept playing.
That you finished the match.

13:34.556 --> 13:37.184
Of course I did.
That's what Linda would have wanted.

13:37.259 --> 13:40.751
It's funny. I would have
been too upset to concentrate.

13:40.829 --> 13:45.198
I was upset, Captain.
That's why it took me 44 moves to win.

13:46.935 --> 13:51.235
Your wife came to see
me this morning, Mr. Kloster.

13:51.306 --> 13:52.364
Did she?

13:52.441 --> 13:57.140
She told me that you'd
been planning to kill her.

13:58.747 --> 14:00.476
My wife was
an unstable woman.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.847
She didn't seem
unstable to me.

14:03.418 --> 14:04.783
I'm sure she didn't.

14:05.854 --> 14:08.186
What did the medical
examiner say?

14:08.256 --> 14:09.723
Heart attack.

14:09.791 --> 14:12.191
Yeah, she didn't
look sick to me.

14:12.260 --> 14:15.559
And what medical school
did you attend, Miss Teeger?

14:15.630 --> 14:17.530
My wife suffered from
high blood pressure.

14:17.599 --> 14:21.558
And for most of her life,
she was an alcoholic and a heavy smoker.

14:22.304 --> 14:23.828
She was also quite depressed.

14:23.905 --> 14:27.341
And there was a 10-million-dollar
life insurance policy.

14:27.409 --> 14:31.402
The policy was Linda's idea.
I'm insured for the same amount.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.347
What do you know about
poison, Mr. Kloster?

14:35.117 --> 14:39.178
Not much. More than you,
I'm sure. But not much.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.280
Although I am an expert
on the Poison Pawn.

14:43.024 --> 14:44.048
Poison...

14:44.126 --> 14:46.458
That is a chess move,
Lieutenant Disher.

14:46.528 --> 14:48.758
I'd be glad to teach it
to you, if you'd like.

14:51.066 --> 14:55.162
Well, as you can imagine,
I have a number of arrangements to make.

14:56.338 --> 14:57.930
Do you play chess,
Mr. Monk?

14:58.006 --> 14:59.496
A little.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.838
We should play
a game sometime.

15:01.910 --> 15:03.241
We already are.

15:08.550 --> 15:11.883
Okay. I found somebody.
He's a grand master national champion.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.215
And he beat Patrick Kloster?

15:13.288 --> 15:15.756
Almost. They played
last year. It was a tie.

15:15.824 --> 15:16.916
Well, where is he?

15:16.992 --> 15:19.620
He's over there.
His name is Eric Tavela.

15:21.229 --> 15:23.163
I can't believe you're
working on a Saturday.

15:23.231 --> 15:26.359
Well, he's not paying me,
so, it's not really work.

15:26.434 --> 15:28.834
Mr. Tavela,
do you have a minute?

15:28.904 --> 15:30.394
A little busy at the moment.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.440
You're, you're Tavela?

15:33.842 --> 15:36.242
I wanted to ask you a couple of
questions about Patrick Kloster.

15:36.311 --> 15:39.212
You know, I'm working here.
You want to talk you've got to play me.

15:39.281 --> 15:40.976
It's 20 bucks.

15:41.950 --> 15:46.216
Yeah. I don't. I don't...
I don't think I have 20 dollars. I don't...

15:46.288 --> 15:49.485
I don't have 20
dollars. I don't...

15:49.558 --> 15:53.289
Do you, do you have any...
I don't think I have twenties.

15:53.929 --> 15:55.760
I have eight dollars.

15:56.565 --> 16:00.194
And an I.O.U.
For $1,800 from my boss.

16:00.268 --> 16:01.667
Who's next?

16:02.504 --> 16:04.233
I can play.

16:04.306 --> 16:06.774
Five dollars, right?
I'm under 18.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.742
You play chess?

16:10.245 --> 16:12.907
I was in the chess club
for two semesters.

16:13.548 --> 16:14.674
Two semesters.

16:14.749 --> 16:18.048
Ooh! That's gonna impress
the Vassar Dean of Admissions.

16:20.488 --> 16:22.012
It's your move.

16:25.627 --> 16:27.652
The Bird Opening.

16:27.729 --> 16:30.323
I've only seen
that five times today.

16:31.166 --> 16:34.761
I understand that you
almost beat Patrick Kloster.

16:34.836 --> 16:36.235
I'll get him next time.

16:36.304 --> 16:38.602
What kind of player
is he, would you say?

16:38.673 --> 16:42.109
Kloster's a behaviorist.
He studies you. Not the game.

16:42.611 --> 16:46.206
He crawls inside your head.
It's kind of spooky.

16:46.281 --> 16:49.079
Yeah.
What is a Poison Pawn?

16:49.885 --> 16:52.410
Well, the Poison Pawn
is a trap.

16:52.487 --> 16:55.012
He dangles a pawn
in the middle of the board.

16:55.090 --> 16:57.752
You know, most
people can't resist it.

16:59.694 --> 17:01.628
And then he swoops in.

17:02.564 --> 17:04.191
And crushes you.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.963
They can't resist it.

17:08.036 --> 17:11.233
That's checkmate.
Thank you, Vassar. That was fun.

17:12.339 --> 17:16.742
A trap. A trap she
couldn't resist.

17:16.810 --> 17:20.109
What, what, what, what?
I know that look. You did it, didn't you?

17:20.181 --> 17:23.241
You figured it out.
Who's the real genius now, huh?

17:23.318 --> 17:26.776
Who just outsmarted the smartest
guy in the whole world? Tell me who.

17:26.855 --> 17:28.049
I did.

17:35.130 --> 17:37.690
This is a funeral
home, Mr. Monk.

17:38.566 --> 17:40.534
My wife has just passed.

17:41.870 --> 17:45.931
I find that grin on your
face rather inappropriate.

17:46.007 --> 17:47.872
I know how you did it.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.177
You still think I
murdered my wife?

17:51.246 --> 17:52.338
You set a trap.

17:52.414 --> 17:53.676
Like the Poison Pawn.

17:54.582 --> 17:58.814
Oh, you've been chatting with
some chess masters. Good for you.

17:58.887 --> 18:02.448
When I was in your bedroom on Wednesday,
I noticed a few things.

18:02.524 --> 18:05.049
I just didn't put it
all together until today.

18:06.461 --> 18:08.861
A glass that had
recently been washed.

18:08.930 --> 18:11.490
Some breath mints.
Some eye drops.

18:11.566 --> 18:14.000
And what did they tell you?

18:14.069 --> 18:16.094
That your wife had
started drinking again.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.504
Married to you,
I don't blame her.

18:19.574 --> 18:23.010
She kept it secret, of course.
At least, she tried to.

18:30.218 --> 18:34.416
How long did it take you to find
her secret stash? A day? A week?

18:35.190 --> 18:39.286
On Wednesday morning, before you left
for Canada, you poisoned her bottle.

18:39.361 --> 18:42.353
Then put it back
where you found it.

18:42.430 --> 18:44.455
Later that day,
Linda took a drink.

18:44.532 --> 18:45.897
The Poison Pawn.

18:45.967 --> 18:49.334
Then, she put the bottle back.
As you knew she would.

18:50.205 --> 18:52.366
It really was brilliant.

18:52.440 --> 18:56.843
You didn't have to hide the poison.
She would drink it, then hide it herself.

18:56.911 --> 18:58.879
Natalie, call the Captain.
Yes, sir.

18:58.947 --> 19:03.907
And did you find this bottle?
This hidden stash? With the poison?

19:03.985 --> 19:06.545
No. Of course not.
It's long gone.

19:06.621 --> 19:08.589
You've had four days
to get rid of it.

19:09.758 --> 19:15.162
But there are still traces of it in here.
In her body.

19:15.230 --> 19:18.666
We're going to run every
toxicology test in the book,

19:18.733 --> 19:21.167
and we're going to find it.

19:21.236 --> 19:24.000
I'm afraid you can't
touch that. I'm sorry.

19:24.072 --> 19:25.733
She was our niece.

19:26.708 --> 19:29.973
Well, I'm a former
police officer,

19:30.045 --> 19:32.275
and I'm afraid we have to
borrow your niece,

19:32.347 --> 19:33.814
her remains, for
a couple of days.

19:33.882 --> 19:34.974
Borrow her?

19:35.050 --> 19:37.610
Yes, we have to run some
toxicology tests on the body.

19:37.685 --> 19:38.743
Oh, my goodness.

19:38.820 --> 19:40.879
No, no, no.
We do it all the time.

19:40.955 --> 19:43.753
We're going to cut her open

19:43.825 --> 19:47.090
just, just a little bit

19:47.162 --> 19:48.220
and

19:49.531 --> 19:52.364
slice off a teeny-tiny...

19:54.135 --> 19:56.695
Tiny piece of her liver.

19:56.771 --> 19:59.069
And her stomach. And maybe...

19:59.140 --> 20:02.871
Take a little... Tiny,

20:02.944 --> 20:05.105
nearly imperceptible bit
of fluid from her eyeball.

20:05.180 --> 20:06.977
Like on TV.
Who likes TV?

20:07.048 --> 20:08.276
But why?

20:09.217 --> 20:12.516
The fact is, we think
she may have been poisoned.

20:12.587 --> 20:15.522
But how did the poison
get in the cable car?

20:16.224 --> 20:18.658
What cable car?
The cable car that hit her.

20:18.726 --> 20:21.024
That's how
Marjorie was killed.

20:24.199 --> 20:25.689
Mr. Monk?
That's not my wife.

20:29.037 --> 20:33.371
My wife is right here.

20:35.510 --> 20:37.944
I had her cremated
two hours ago.

20:38.513 --> 20:42.745
As you can see,
I have anticipated your every move.

20:42.817 --> 20:44.045
Cremated.

20:44.119 --> 20:46.679
Yes. I don't think your toxicology
tests are going to do much good.

20:46.754 --> 20:48.881
But you are welcome to try.

20:49.357 --> 20:51.951
Oh, I know that look.

20:53.228 --> 20:54.593
I've seen it quite often.

20:54.662 --> 20:57.995
It's how my opponents look when
they know they've been beaten.

20:59.334 --> 21:01.097
Your move, Mr. Monk.

21:06.908 --> 21:12.642
"In chess, as in life, creative strategies
executed with daring and precision

21:12.714 --> 21:17.879
"will allow you to overwhelm your
opponent and achieve your goal." The end.

21:17.952 --> 21:20.420
And may I say, "Thank God."

21:20.488 --> 21:21.750
Keep reading.
Here's the next one.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.121
Oh, Mr. Monk, come on.
We've been reading his books all day.

21:24.192 --> 21:25.489
What good are they doing?

21:25.560 --> 21:29.121
I'm getting into his head.
He's in my head.

21:29.197 --> 21:34.601
I have to be in his head.
So, we're in each other's heads.

21:37.539 --> 21:40.702
Chess Domination
by Patrick Kloster.

21:40.775 --> 21:43.039
Well, this will be
the opposite of fun.

21:43.111 --> 21:44.874
"For my queen, Tatiana."

21:44.946 --> 21:46.846
You don't have to
read the dedication.

21:46.915 --> 21:50.510
Fine, sorry. What's this?
Linda Kloster's check.

21:50.585 --> 21:52.780
You didn't deposit this?
I'll never deposit it.

21:52.854 --> 21:55.186
But Mr. Monk, she
wanted you to cash it.

21:55.256 --> 21:58.817
Mr. Monk, if you deposit this check,
then you can pay your staff.

21:58.893 --> 22:01.259
And when I say
staff, I mean me.

22:02.931 --> 22:06.298
She came to me.
I didn't protect her.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.335
Mr. Monk, you did
everything you could.

22:08.403 --> 22:11.304
What about the promise I made
that he wouldn't get away with it?

22:11.372 --> 22:13.397
You made a promise to me, too...
There he is.

22:13.474 --> 22:14.498
What?
My God.

22:14.576 --> 22:17.136
Oh, my God. He's coming.
What do we do? We should kiss.

22:17.212 --> 22:20.613
No! I didn't say that.
I wasn't thinking. I never said that.

22:22.817 --> 22:25.945
Good morning.
I thought you might be thirsty.

22:27.021 --> 22:30.047
Well, this is for
you, Natalie.

22:30.124 --> 22:31.887
It's lemonade.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.929
And, Mr. Monk, I believe
this is your brand.

22:38.299 --> 22:40.164
Wow. My books.

22:41.769 --> 22:43.498
I could autograph
one for you.

22:43.571 --> 22:45.061
No, thank you. No.

22:46.174 --> 22:49.507
Very well.
I'll leave you two alone.

22:50.511 --> 22:53.139
Enjoy your little stake-out.

22:58.586 --> 23:01.419
Well, you have to admit.
He's pretty good.

23:04.025 --> 23:06.459
What? He was right.
I was thirsty.

23:09.831 --> 23:11.958
What?

23:12.033 --> 23:14.001
How do you feel?

23:14.068 --> 23:15.501
I feel fine.

23:17.605 --> 23:18.867
What?

23:18.940 --> 23:20.771
It just occurred to me.

23:20.842 --> 23:23.572
If there's poison in that lemonade,
we could go to the DA

23:23.645 --> 23:25.977
and we'd have all
the evidence we need.

23:26.047 --> 23:28.880
It just occurred to you?
And you didn't say anything?

23:28.950 --> 23:32.147
My God, Mr. Monk,
I have never seen you like this!

23:33.187 --> 23:35.018
How're you feeling now? You know,
I hate to disappoint you,

23:35.089 --> 23:36.886
but I feel fine.
Try the water.

23:36.958 --> 23:39.791
Oh, my God. That's it.
We are going home.

23:43.564 --> 23:45.964
Wait. Stop the car.

23:46.034 --> 23:47.729
What. What.
What are you doing?

23:47.802 --> 23:49.235
Just stop, stop, stop the car.
No!

23:49.304 --> 23:51.169
Wait! What are you doing?

23:52.240 --> 23:54.174
Where are you going?
His garden.

23:54.242 --> 23:55.607
His garden?

24:00.148 --> 24:02.013
Oleander.
It's from his garden.

24:02.083 --> 24:03.880
It's poisonous.
Very poisonous.

24:03.951 --> 24:06.317
You dry the sap,
you grind it into a powder.

24:06.387 --> 24:08.355
A quarter of a gram is
enough to kill an adult.

24:08.423 --> 24:09.481
It would look like
she had a heart attack.

24:09.557 --> 24:12.788
It did look like she had a heart attack.
This is how he did it.

24:13.928 --> 24:16.328
So, you were in his garden?
On his property?

24:16.397 --> 24:19.423
You said you wanted evidence.
Hard evidence. Here it is.

24:19.500 --> 24:23.061
Monk, a million people have this flower
in their garden. I used to have some.

24:23.137 --> 24:25.298
Let's let the DA decide.

24:26.574 --> 24:29.668
Monk, I am not going
to the DA waving a shrub.

24:31.913 --> 24:33.744
Look. You don't
seem to understand.

24:33.815 --> 24:38.377
This Patrick Kloster thing is a big,
bad headline just waiting to happen.

24:38.453 --> 24:43.857
Now, I know that you're upset. I know
that this case is very important to you.

24:43.925 --> 24:46.291
But we need real,
hard evidence.

24:47.228 --> 24:49.287
Maybe if you found some
powder already ground up

24:49.364 --> 24:50.695
in a little bottle
inside his house.

24:50.765 --> 24:51.959
Maybe then.

24:52.033 --> 24:53.364
In a bottle?

24:56.771 --> 24:58.534
Right. We wouldn't
even need his fingerprints.

24:58.606 --> 25:01.006
We could just say
he wore gloves.

25:01.576 --> 25:03.203
What did you say?

25:04.545 --> 25:06.342
Oh, nothing. Nothing.

25:07.448 --> 25:09.678
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:09.751 --> 25:11.981
Come here. I want to show you something.
What is it?

25:12.053 --> 25:13.987
Down the hall, there's a sign.
I think it's a little crooked.

25:14.055 --> 25:15.181
I want your opinion.

25:15.256 --> 25:17.451
Crooked? I'll be right back.

25:17.525 --> 25:18.787
Come on.

25:18.860 --> 25:20.589
How crooked is it?

25:20.661 --> 25:23.221
Oh, it's very crooked.
You're not going to believe it.

25:23.297 --> 25:24.764
Why do you need me?

25:24.832 --> 25:27.699
Because I'm not sure
if it is crooked.

25:27.769 --> 25:29.669
You just said
it's very crooked.

25:29.737 --> 25:32.535
Look. I don't know,
Monk. It's...

25:32.607 --> 25:33.801
Is anybody else in there?

25:33.875 --> 25:35.502
Mmm-mmm.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.734
It's in here.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.583
There's nothing
crooked in here.

25:46.220 --> 25:47.585
I hope not.

25:52.059 --> 25:53.458
Don't do it.

25:55.496 --> 25:57.020
Don't do what?

25:59.233 --> 26:00.791
Break my heart.

26:03.938 --> 26:07.635
You're thinking about planting
evidence in Kloster's house.

26:10.978 --> 26:15.881
Monk, I've been a cop for 30 years.
I've had this conversation nine times.

26:15.950 --> 26:19.010
I never thought that
I'd be having it with you.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.646
There's a line.

26:23.624 --> 26:27.390
You step across it, and you're gone for good.
And there's no going back.

26:27.462 --> 26:30.431
You don't understand.
I do understand.

26:30.498 --> 26:34.696
I've been there. I've had cases like this,
cases you couldn't shake.

26:35.436 --> 26:37.870
Sometimes,
you have to let it go.

26:39.574 --> 26:40.905
Let it go?

26:41.576 --> 26:43.339
We have to move on.

26:44.145 --> 26:45.703
There's a city.

26:45.780 --> 26:49.841
A city full of people, other people,
that need our help right now.

26:52.420 --> 26:54.217
When Trudy was dying,

26:55.156 --> 26:57.647
I got there late.
Almost too late.

26:57.725 --> 26:58.851
I was there.

26:58.926 --> 27:02.225
She was slipping away.
She couldn't speak.

27:03.564 --> 27:06.590
All she could
do was reach out.

27:08.169 --> 27:09.363
She...

27:12.907 --> 27:15.205
She grabbed me
with both hands.

27:18.379 --> 27:19.937
Just like this.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.817
Eleven years later
I still feel it.

27:29.323 --> 27:34.192
When I promised Linda Kloster,
when I gave her my solemn word

27:34.262 --> 27:38.699
that her husband would pay,
she grabbed my hand

27:40.301 --> 27:42.064
the exact same way.

27:50.478 --> 27:52.605
I'm not letting this one go.

27:57.451 --> 27:59.146
I'm not moving on.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.897
That's an illegal
move, Mr. Monk.

29:52.833 --> 29:57.065
Something I'd expect
from a much weaker player.

29:57.138 --> 30:00.630
The truth is,
I have been waiting for you all night.

30:00.708 --> 30:01.766
I had almost given up.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.003
You were waiting for me?
Hmm.

30:04.078 --> 30:08.674
Ever since I noticed a branch missing
from an oleander bush in my garden.

30:08.749 --> 30:13.777
You don't really think that window was left
unlocked by accident, do you, Mr. Monk?

30:16.924 --> 30:18.323
Breaking and entering.

30:18.392 --> 30:20.758
I believe that is a felony.

30:22.730 --> 30:26.222
Don't worry,
I'm not a litigious man.

30:26.934 --> 30:30.028
I prefer to settle my
problems out of court.

30:30.104 --> 30:31.765
As you well know.

30:36.077 --> 30:40.343
I am replaying a match
of mine from 1995.

30:40.414 --> 30:42.746
Boris Spassky was
playing white.

30:43.317 --> 30:47.617
Where would we be without our little games?
Eh, Mr. Monk?

30:47.688 --> 30:50.486
Sixty-four perfect
little squares.

30:50.558 --> 30:54.187
An island of order
in a chaotic world.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.090
This is where I beat him.
Right...

31:03.170 --> 31:04.535
...there.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.158
This is a wedding gift.

31:35.236 --> 31:38.865
You dedicated one of your
books to "My queen, Tatiana."

31:40.341 --> 31:41.603
You were married before.

31:41.675 --> 31:43.074
Very good, Mr. Monk.

31:45.579 --> 31:46.876
Divorced?

31:49.250 --> 31:50.740
My wife died.

31:52.253 --> 31:53.618
She must have
been quite young.

31:53.687 --> 31:55.314
Yes, she was.

32:00.761 --> 32:02.251
Let me guess.

32:06.467 --> 32:07.957
Heart attack.

32:08.602 --> 32:12.038
Mr. Kloster? The District Attorney's
office and Captain Stottlemeyer

32:12.106 --> 32:15.007
would like to exhume the
body of your first wife.

32:15.075 --> 32:16.508
I've read their application.

32:16.577 --> 32:20.035
They've listed a number of
similarities between the two cases.

32:20.114 --> 32:25.552
Your first wife, Tatiana Bay Kloster,
was in her thirties, apparently healthy,

32:25.619 --> 32:28.986
and died from a sudden
and severe cardiac event.

32:30.024 --> 32:33.084
She, too, was heavily insured.

32:33.160 --> 32:36.357
Captain Stottlemeyer and Mr.
Monk have been to Pacifica.

32:36.430 --> 32:39.126
They've spoken to some
of your old neighbors,

32:39.200 --> 32:44.160
and a few of them remember you had oleander
plants in your garden 15 years ago.

32:45.206 --> 32:49.302
I'm convinced. There's a clear
and unique pattern of behavior.

32:49.376 --> 32:52.140
I am going to
grant this petition.

32:52.213 --> 32:55.740
Your first wife's body will be
exhumed first thing tomorrow.

32:55.816 --> 32:57.943
And let me warn you.

32:58.018 --> 33:02.682
Lf, in fact, there are traces
of this poison in her body

33:02.756 --> 33:07.352
you can expect the District Attorney's
office to bring two counts of murder.

33:12.399 --> 33:13.832
Thank you, Judge.

33:14.401 --> 33:17.734
Section 2-61.
Should be up there.

33:24.979 --> 33:26.344
Here. Here it is.

33:27.715 --> 33:30.013
Hey, hey! Over here!

33:33.954 --> 33:35.751
You are making
a big mistake.

33:35.823 --> 33:37.791
You made the mistake, Kloster.

33:38.592 --> 33:41.789
You should have had
your first wife cremated, too.

33:42.229 --> 33:44.163
Sorry for the delay.
We know how important this is,

33:44.231 --> 33:45.630
so we wanted to make sure.

33:45.699 --> 33:49.226
There was no poison in the body.
We didn't find a thing.

33:50.170 --> 33:51.660
Impossible.

33:51.739 --> 33:54.139
The woman died
of natural causes.

33:54.208 --> 33:55.835
We're sure of it.

33:59.947 --> 34:01.812
Thank you, Mr. Monk.

34:01.882 --> 34:03.110
What for?

34:04.752 --> 34:07.846
Our little game.
To be honest with you,

34:10.591 --> 34:12.388
I'm sorry it's over.

34:18.666 --> 34:22.067
M. C: Excuse us. There you go.
Gonna need you, young man. Let's do this.

34:22.136 --> 34:24.797
Hello, everybody.
Thank you so much for your generous support.

34:24.871 --> 34:27.033
We're going to begin the
exhibition in just a few minutes.

34:27.107 --> 34:30.007
International grand
master Patrick Kloster

34:30.077 --> 34:31.408
will be playing
simultaneous matches

34:31.478 --> 34:34.139
against four of the highest-ranked
players in California.

34:34.214 --> 34:36.739
It should prove to
be very exciting.

34:38.418 --> 34:41.684
Oh, there's that kid from
the park. What a geep.

34:42.222 --> 34:43.813
What's a "geep?"

34:44.692 --> 34:47.525
I don't know.
It's a geek who's a little creepy.

34:47.594 --> 34:50.859
All right, Mr. Monk. I have to be honest,
I'm still not quite sure why we're here.

34:50.931 --> 34:53.297
He won't talk to you.
He won't return your phone calls.

34:53.367 --> 34:55.835
What can we do?
I don't know.

34:55.902 --> 34:58.064
But I can't just quit.

34:58.138 --> 35:00.902
To me, quitting would
be like giving up.

35:00.975 --> 35:03.967
If I was playing
against him,

35:04.044 --> 35:06.342
he'd have to
talk to me. Right?

35:07.247 --> 35:08.874
Okay. Wait here.

35:14.688 --> 35:16.485
What's she doing?

35:16.557 --> 35:19.890
She's... She's flirting.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.951
She's good at it.
Shut up.

35:22.029 --> 35:23.462
She's definitely
done this before.

35:23.530 --> 35:24.588
Okay.

35:27.201 --> 35:29.032
Yeah. She's got it down.
Thank you.

35:29.103 --> 35:32.664
Mom? You remember
my friend, Eric.

35:32.740 --> 35:36.198
I told him about the case.
And about how you think

35:36.276 --> 35:37.971
Mr. Kloster killed his wife.

35:38.045 --> 35:39.069
I believe it, too.

35:39.146 --> 35:41.910
Congratulations.
You're player number one.

35:41.982 --> 35:44.177
You mean I can
play in the tournament?

35:44.251 --> 35:48.745
You're my proxy. It's in the bylaws.
I can designate someone to take my place.

35:48.822 --> 35:49.914
Thank you.

35:49.990 --> 35:51.753
Don't bring out your
queen too early.

35:56.163 --> 35:59.360
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome international grand master,

35:59.433 --> 36:01.025
Patrick Kloster.

36:08.275 --> 36:11.608
Well, well, well.
The tenacious Mr. Monk.

36:11.678 --> 36:14.806
Your threshold for pain
must be extraordinary.

36:14.882 --> 36:17.112
It's your move.
Yes. I know.

36:18.485 --> 36:22.683
Linda must have truly despised me,
to have brought you into my life.

36:34.068 --> 36:35.626
Mr. Monk.

36:35.702 --> 36:37.966
That's my piece, Mr. Monk.

36:38.038 --> 36:41.064
I'm just centering it.
You'll thank me later.

37:07.968 --> 37:09.265
Mr. Monk?

37:42.035 --> 37:43.161
Mom.

37:43.237 --> 37:44.295
Okay.

37:57.918 --> 37:59.215
Mr. Monk.

38:00.087 --> 38:01.315
Please.

38:03.524 --> 38:04.752
I pass.

38:05.492 --> 38:07.050
You can't pass.

38:07.961 --> 38:10.452
For the love of God,
why don't you just resign?

38:10.531 --> 38:13.022
How about this?
If I win this game,

38:14.168 --> 38:17.262
you have to tell me how
you poisoned your wives.

38:18.438 --> 38:22.033
What are you talking about?
I am not agreeing to that.

38:22.109 --> 38:24.703
How about this?
If we play to a draw,

38:25.145 --> 38:27.511
you come with me to
police headquarters.

38:27.581 --> 38:30.448
Mr. Monk, I'm not
negotiating with you.

38:30.517 --> 38:33.509
When are you going to
realize that it is over?

38:42.262 --> 38:43.695
You're castling?

38:43.764 --> 38:46.562
Yes, the rook and the
king switch places.

38:48.368 --> 38:51.201
They switch places.

38:51.271 --> 38:55.173
Yes. It's the best way I know
to get oneself out of trouble.

39:50.931 --> 39:52.330
This is it.

40:00.841 --> 40:04.971
You came here that night before
we exhumed your wife's body,

40:05.712 --> 40:07.839
and switched headstones.

40:08.548 --> 40:11.278
That's why we didn't
find any poison.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.342
We dug up the wrong body.

40:16.490 --> 40:18.287
Very good, Mr. Monk.

40:19.760 --> 40:21.421
You play
a brilliant endgame.

40:21.495 --> 40:23.429
All right.

40:23.497 --> 40:27.763
Can I tell you something?
I am sick and tired of you talking like this.

40:27.834 --> 40:31.292
All these chess metaphors.
Two women are dead.

40:31.371 --> 40:34.135
They're not chess pieces, Patrick.
They're human beings.

40:34.207 --> 40:36.368
I think they deserve better.

40:40.447 --> 40:42.915
Although, if you insist...

40:45.385 --> 40:46.716
Checkmate.

41:02.769 --> 41:04.964
What?
Nothing.

41:05.038 --> 41:08.633
I was just thinking about the
case and how you solved it.

41:09.710 --> 41:11.109
You really are amazing.

41:11.178 --> 41:12.202
Well...

41:12.279 --> 41:15.112
Thank you.
No, you really are my hero.

41:16.183 --> 41:18.708
Okay. Now, I thought,
I know it sounds crazy,

41:18.785 --> 41:21.845
Mr. Monk, but...
Could I have your autograph?

41:22.189 --> 41:24.714
Oh, please. Please!
Just to have it. For myself.

41:24.791 --> 41:27.089
Like a keepsake. Come on.
It will just take a second.

41:27.160 --> 41:30.152
All right. If it really
means something to you.

41:34.534 --> 41:35.660
Okay.

41:38.405 --> 41:40.635
Thank you.
That's Linda Kloster's check.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.902
Which you just endorsed.
I'll be right back. I'm going to the bank.

41:42.976 --> 41:45.274
You can't deposit that.
Why not?

41:45.345 --> 41:47.609
You solved the case. You kept your promise.
Besides, I need the money.

41:47.681 --> 41:49.546
Natalie, let, let go.
Just give it back.

41:49.616 --> 41:51.584
I think those books are out of order.
Where?

41:51.651 --> 41:53.278
Nat...

41:56.089 --> 41:58.922
Oh, my God.
They really are out of order.
