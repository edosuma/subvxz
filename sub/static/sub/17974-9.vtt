You know, I just watched
a Valentine's special

00:36.070 --> 00:37.903
on the OWN network--

00:37.905 --> 00:40.806
you know, the network
Oprah wasted $2 billion on?

00:40.808 --> 00:42.741
No, I assumed
Oprah had died.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.843
Mm-hmm. So,

00:44.845 --> 00:47.579
Oprah was doing a show about
renewing your wedding vows.

00:47.581 --> 00:50.315
She said a renewal ceremony
can strengthen a marriage.

00:50.317 --> 00:52.051
Oprah, who's never been
married, said that?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.986
Oh, Cleveland,
it's not just Oprah.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.754
All my friends
have done this.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.424
Mary, Sybil,
Edith, Lavinia, O'Brien,

01:01.429 --> 01:03.162
Those are aren't your friends,

01:03.164 --> 01:04.763
that's that cast
of  <i>Downton Abbey!</i>

01:04.765 --> 01:06.932
Aha! You did watch it.

01:06.934 --> 01:08.500
Don't tell the guys.

01:08.502 --> 01:10.602
Cleveland,
we're doing this.

01:10.604 --> 01:14.039
For Valentine's Day, I want us
to have a vow
renewing ceremony.

01:14.041 --> 01:15.674
Oh, God!

01:15.676 --> 01:17.242
I divided our tasks.

01:17.244 --> 01:19.244
I split up what we need
to get done beforehand.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.446
What?!

01:20.448 --> 01:22.214
Build a gazebo?

01:22.216 --> 01:23.115
Rent a tuzedo?

01:23.117 --> 01:25.784
And where, pray tell,

01:25.786 --> 01:29.021
do you think I'm going to find
14 peacocks?

01:29.023 --> 01:31.056
Please?

01:31.058 --> 01:34.393
After the ceremony,
I'll let you do that thing

01:34.395 --> 01:35.794
I promised you could do
on our wedding night

01:35.796 --> 01:38.530
that I lied about
and didn't let you do

01:38.532 --> 01:40.966
that I'm probably
still lying about now.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.067
I'm in!

01:42.069 --> 01:43.268
(slurping)

01:43.270 --> 01:45.871
(screaming)

01:45.873 --> 01:48.273
My refrigerator, Perry!

01:48.275 --> 01:49.875
He's dead!

01:49.877 --> 01:51.543
Oh, why did I push
Perry so hard?

01:51.545 --> 01:54.880
Poor appliance
didn't stand a chance.

01:54.882 --> 01:57.049
Here are details
for the funeral.

01:57.051 --> 01:58.550
(sighs)
I'll go get Roberta

01:58.552 --> 02:01.253
and a few other
ancillary characters.

02:01.255 --> 02:05.224
So, now, when someone
prank calls me

02:05.226 --> 02:07.426
and asks if my
refrigerator is running,

02:07.428 --> 02:11.597
I will sadly tell them,
"Not anymore."

02:11.599 --> 02:13.632
Not anymore.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.569
And because of Perry,

02:17.571 --> 02:22.474
the light inside us all
shines a little brighter.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.110
But only when the door
of our hearts is open.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.995
What do you say, Donna?

02:42.997 --> 02:44.630
How do you plan to
get this outside?

02:44.632 --> 02:46.365
Hmm?

02:46.367 --> 02:47.432
And how are
your vows coming?

02:47.434 --> 02:49.468
What vows?

02:49.470 --> 02:51.837
Cleveland, the whole point
of a vow renewal ceremony

02:51.839 --> 02:54.439
is to offer personalized vows.

02:54.441 --> 02:55.207
I assumed you understood that.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.542
Ha! Dummy.

02:56.544 --> 03:00.479
Now help me flip
this thing on its side.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.014
(grunting)

03:02.016 --> 03:03.182
Wow.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.954
Ooh, nice tuzedo.

03:08.956 --> 03:11.690
And why are you bringing all
those rainbow weeds in here?

03:11.692 --> 03:13.292
They're flowers,
Lester.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.960
(sniffs)

03:14.962 --> 03:16.495
They smell like
our toilet spray.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.631
Yeah, well, it's too hot
in the car; they'd wilt.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.567
And I still have to
write my vows.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.835
Dude, you're a little
high-strung.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.238
You want to
take off your shirt
and I'll give you a massage?

03:26.240 --> 03:27.306
Not gay if other dudes
are watching.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.807
All right,
you heard him.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.576
None of you
may look away.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.644
Get to work, Holt.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.580
Mm.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.415
Lester, will hand me
my  <i>Cars 2</i> Trapper Keeper?

03:38.651 --> 03:41.520
(sighs)
All righty, let's see.

03:41.522 --> 03:42.554
Vows.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.357
"I, Cleveland"-- good start--

03:45.359 --> 03:47.025
"being of sound mind..."

03:47.027 --> 03:51.163
Probably need a verb here.
To run?

03:51.165 --> 03:52.898
"I, Cleveland, to run..."

03:52.900 --> 03:54.199
Ran?

03:54.201 --> 03:57.869
Did the guy already do
the run? Ah.

03:57.871 --> 03:59.571
"I, Cleveland..."

03:59.573 --> 04:00.672
Ah, screw it.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.908
Writing's hard.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.544
That's why only Aaron Sorkin
and Fscott
Fitzgerald can do it.

04:05.546 --> 04:07.112
If you ask me,
I think...

04:07.114 --> 04:09.214
(grunting)

04:09.216 --> 04:12.618
You know what,
Holt? Enough.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.219
Cleveland, you're approaching
this from
the wrong perspective.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.787
Don't you get it?

04:15.789 --> 04:18.123
You can renegotiate
your marital contract

04:18.125 --> 04:19.691
to your advantage.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.027
I do that with Kendra
every six months.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.229
Last week, I finally got her
to agree to

04:24.231 --> 04:26.698
close the garage door
when she's dropping a grumpy.

04:26.700 --> 04:27.532
Big win for me.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.635
Big win for all of us.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.536
You're right.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.705
I can define the marriage
on terms any man would want.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.941
And Donna will
appreciate it, too,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.143
because it'll be
a relationship
built on honesty.

04:38.145 --> 04:40.879
And that's all women want:
the truth.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.681
And money.

04:48.721 --> 04:51.423
(panting): Man, why did I pick
the bedroom

04:51.425 --> 04:53.892
all the way at the end
of the hall?

04:53.894 --> 04:57.095
If I knew then how fat
I'd be now...

04:57.097 --> 04:59.831
(screams)

04:59.833 --> 05:02.301
Perry has come back from
the dead to exact his revenge!

05:02.303 --> 05:04.136
The prophecy is true!

05:04.138 --> 05:06.772
No, you dumb oaf,
he wasn't dead.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.574
The outlet you had him
plugged into was dead.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.343
So, I dug him up,
cleaned him off,

05:11.345 --> 05:12.778
and he's good to go.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.478
Thanks, Rallo.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.580
I owe you one.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.616
Whoa, where do you think
you're taking Perry?

05:17.618 --> 05:19.284
He's my fridge now.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.653
Nuh-uh,
that's my property.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.255
I filled out
a warranty and everything!

05:23.257 --> 05:24.690
Did you send it in?

05:24.692 --> 05:26.692
I meant to send it in.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.261
Be that as it may, Junior,
it was abandoned property.

05:29.263 --> 05:32.464
And as such, all ownership
rights are extinguished.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.467
I cite the precedence set by

05:35.469 --> 05:38.036
<i>Finders Keepers</i>
<i>v. Losers Weepers.</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:39.271

05:39.273 --> 05:40.939
I'm taking
what's mine.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.543
You could, but then,
what of our society?

05:46.612 --> 05:49.648
I thought we were
a country of laws, not men.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.717
(groans)
You're right.

05:51.719 --> 05:54.653
I refuse to be an instrument
of our social destruction.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.221
Fine. Perry is yours.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.689
I won't even miss him.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.658
(refrigerator humming)

05:59.660 --> 06:00.726
Oh.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.195
(imitates humming)

06:09.869 --> 06:12.371
I look better than my mama.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.672
Don't you Pippa me, bitch!

06:13.674 --> 06:14.706
This is my day.

06:19.078 --> 06:22.147
Dearly beloved
and pilfering catering staff,

06:22.149 --> 06:26.718
we are gathered here today
for an unnecessary repetition

06:26.720 --> 06:29.321
of a once-in-a-lifetime event.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.089
And to make matters worse,

06:31.091 --> 06:33.725
I'm told you've written
your own vows.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.396
Thank you, Reverend, for
your beautiful words.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.597
Cleveland will
go first.

06:39.832 --> 06:42.401
(playing mellow
classical music)

06:42.403 --> 06:44.336
(clears throat)

06:44.338 --> 06:47.939
I, Cleveland, in the spirit
of making our union greater

06:47.941 --> 06:50.008
and our love stronger,

06:50.010 --> 06:52.611
do solemnly vow
the following:

06:52.613 --> 06:56.915
I vow not to interfere with
your kitchen duties.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.684
I'm not good at it
and don't like it.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.020
You, however, have proven
how much you enjoy it,

07:02.022 --> 07:05.590
night after night,
by cooking my meals

07:05.592 --> 07:07.359
and then washing the dishes.

07:07.361 --> 07:10.095
On that note,
let's make a promise

07:10.097 --> 07:14.232
to not just fill a bowl with
water to,
quote, "let it soak,"

07:14.234 --> 07:16.435
but let's you wash
that bowl to completion,

07:16.437 --> 07:17.969
dry it and put it away.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.205
What?

07:20.207 --> 07:22.741
I vow to keep
guys' night sacred,

07:22.743 --> 07:24.576
two-to-every nights a week.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.279
And by doing so, I will
come back a better husband,

07:27.281 --> 07:29.748
relaxed from alcohol,

07:29.750 --> 07:32.250
and ready
to do you just right.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.718
(clicks tongue, whistles)

07:33.720 --> 07:37.489
I vow for us never again
to watch TV together.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.591
You just jabber
through the shows anyway,

07:39.593 --> 07:41.793
and you never understand
what's happening.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.296
If you would stop jabbering,
you'd know.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.398
You're my dream.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.834
You always have been.

07:48.836 --> 07:52.103
You have made a mockery of
my emotions and our marriage!

07:52.105 --> 07:54.072
(crying)
Well.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.474
(squawking)

07:55.476 --> 07:59.478
Well, Tim,
I owe you one dollar.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.847
She reacted
exactly as you said.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.248
Yay!

08:11.190 --> 08:13.158
Yoo-hoo! Hi!

08:13.160 --> 08:15.527
There you are.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.162
Missed you at
the reception.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.331
You know who's a
good dancer? Gus.

08:19.333 --> 08:22.868
Nobody touched the crostinis
that you insisted on.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.938
And, Donna, if any part of
this was my fault, I'm sorry.

08:26.940 --> 08:30.008
Cleveland,
a phoned-in apology

08:30.010 --> 08:32.277
is not going to
be enough this time.

08:32.279 --> 08:36.448
This is the 21st century--
it won't be phoned in,

08:36.450 --> 08:38.550
I'm faxing it.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.551
(keypad beeping)

08:39.553 --> 08:41.453
(fax machine dialing)

08:41.455 --> 08:42.687
(modem beeps)

08:45.391 --> 08:47.893
(fax machine rings, beeps)

08:47.895 --> 08:49.661
Donna, you
have a fax.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.563
I mean it.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.366
You humiliated me in front of
our townspeople.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.202
But more than that,
that's how you
see our marriage?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.904
A bunch of
constant annoyances?

08:58.906 --> 09:00.005
That's a trick question.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.473
If I say yes, you'll get mad.

09:01.475 --> 09:04.476
If I say no, I'm lying.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.378
Cleveland,
this is a crisis.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.913
We need
marriage counseling.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.314
Marriage counseling?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.882
How much is that
going to cost?

09:10.884 --> 09:11.983
$80 a week.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.885
$80?!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.987
Do you know how many inches
of five-dollar foot-longs

09:15.989 --> 09:16.888
we could buy with that?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.324
Cleveland jr.:
192!

09:19.326 --> 09:21.259
See, what would
you rather have?

09:21.261 --> 09:22.861
A happy marriage or
lots of sandwich?

09:22.863 --> 09:23.695
Cleveland jr.:
Lots of sandwich!

09:23.697 --> 09:26.331
That'll be all, buddy.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.400
Cleveland, we're going to
marriage counseling,

09:28.402 --> 09:29.935
and that's final.

09:29.937 --> 09:33.071
Fine, but I will do nothing
but groan.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.906
Like this.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.274
And mutter like this.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.777
(muttering):
Marriage counseling.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.413
Perry!

09:41.415 --> 09:43.181
Rallo must've
changed his mind!

09:47.920 --> 09:51.590
This is what I imagined was in
the briefcase in  <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

09:51.592 --> 09:55.226
I see you notice the
hotel-quality minibar.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.929
I took the liberty of
stocking it up for you.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.265
Here's a list of
prices for reference.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.601
What?! You want me
to pay eight dollars

10:02.603 --> 10:04.903
for a package
of six peanut M&M's?!

10:04.905 --> 10:07.205
God, no.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.740
I want you to
pay eight dollars
for a package of

10:08.742 --> 10:11.543
six peanut M&M's in your room.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.111
I see what you're doing,
but it won't work.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.880
I'm going to go down
to the store

10:15.882 --> 10:18.149
and stock up on treats
for a tenth of the price.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.217
You're right, Junior.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.452
Enjoy your quarter-mile trip.

10:20.454 --> 10:22.821
Quarter mile?

10:23.723 --> 10:26.458
No, I can make it.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.526
(groaning)

10:33.633 --> 10:35.567
It's got to be, what,
58 degrees out there?

10:35.569 --> 10:37.736
Stay warm.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.804
I'll be fine.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.973
(wind whistling)

10:41.975 --> 10:43.808
Cartoons!

10:48.314 --> 10:49.681
Cleveland, I'm sounding
like a broken record here,

10:49.683 --> 10:53.618
but what Donna is saying
is a reasonable request.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.154
Oh, so you agree with
Donna on that, too!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.790
So, that makes the
score nine-to-nothing.

10:58.792 --> 11:01.493
There's no score, Cleveland.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.961
This isn't about winning.

11:02.963 --> 11:03.662
She's right, Cleveland.

11:03.664 --> 11:04.829
Ten-nothing.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.632
Slaughter rule,
I'm out of here.

11:07.634 --> 11:09.668
I sense your frustration,
Cleveland.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.836
But Donna wasn't asking you
to renew your vows

11:11.838 --> 11:14.172
so you could change the
parameters of your marriage.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.774
She was asking you
to reaffirm your love

11:15.776 --> 11:17.642
and commitment to her.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.644
Word for word,
that's exactly
what I told him.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.512
I never heard Donna say
anything close that that.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.047
Cleveland, I believe

11:22.049 --> 11:24.015
that you never heard
Donna say that.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.851
Yeah! I finally
get on the board.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.187
Because you were not
listening to Donna.

11:29.189 --> 11:32.724
You've got a slappable
face, you know that?

11:32.726 --> 11:35.727
I understand
marriage counseling
is stressful, Cleveland.

11:35.729 --> 11:37.696
So, I'm going to
write you a prescription.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.465
Come on, Xanax.
Daddy needs some Xanax.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.003
"800 milligrams of
listening to Donna

11:45.005 --> 11:47.205
five times a day"?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.140
And I should warn you,

11:49.142 --> 11:52.143
side effects may include:
a stronger marriage.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.345
And who knows, you might
even enjoy the things

11:54.347 --> 11:56.681
she likes to do.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.983
DONNA:
Lingerie pillow fight!

11:58.985 --> 12:02.387
What an interesting name
for a modern art piece.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.189
It has a magnificent
otherness.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.924
Mm-hmm. Magnificent.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.325
Negative space.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.860
Bryant Gumbel.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.762
Get it?
Black square.

12:10.764 --> 12:13.264
Wasting my best stuff
at a museum.

12:19.105 --> 12:20.705
(stomach grumbling)

12:20.707 --> 12:23.274
Come on, stomach,
now you're being silly.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.010
No chocolate covered almond
is worth $16.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.679
Even you have to admit that.

12:27.681 --> 12:30.749
(stomach grumbling)

12:30.751 --> 12:32.884
I'm sorry.
No, I want it, too.

12:32.886 --> 12:33.818
Maybe just one.

12:36.555 --> 12:38.757
(stomach sighs)

12:38.759 --> 12:39.824
You're welcome.

12:42.728 --> 12:45.864
And next time, Cleveland,
maybe instead of telling her

12:45.866 --> 12:46.931
not to cry
because she's tired,

12:46.933 --> 12:50.401
you can try
crying with her.

12:50.403 --> 12:53.872
Oh, Doctor, you are an angel
sent from heaven.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.540
Can I use your crapper?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.875
Certainly.
Here's the key.

12:58.744 --> 13:01.813
Cleveland, let me try
an experiment here.

13:01.815 --> 13:04.149
If you're happy
and you know it,
clap your hands.

13:05.751 --> 13:07.986
Hmm. Did you notice
you didn't clap?

13:07.988 --> 13:09.921
Yeah, that's for
one of two reasons:

13:09.923 --> 13:10.789
either you're happy
and you don't know it,

13:10.791 --> 13:13.558
or you're not happy.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.826
Or I suppose you may just
not want to show it.

13:14.828 --> 13:17.762
The test is flawed.

13:17.764 --> 13:21.099
What I'm trying to say to you
is: how'd you like to win?

13:21.101 --> 13:23.434
Why did your eyes narrow
like that?

13:23.436 --> 13:27.071
I'm just saying,
for the right price,

13:27.073 --> 13:29.941
I could start making
things go your way.

13:29.943 --> 13:33.178
Maybe for an extra $100
a week, hmm?

13:33.180 --> 13:34.946
You're asking me to bribe you
to take my side

13:34.948 --> 13:37.415
in disputes with my wife?!

13:37.417 --> 13:38.917
Yes, you're right.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.351
It was inappropriate
to suggest...

13:40.353 --> 13:43.021
Bah-bah-bah!
I simply needed half a second

13:43.023 --> 13:46.024
to absorb the magnitude
of your obscene proposal.

13:46.026 --> 13:48.493
Do you know today's date?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.529
(toilet flushes)

13:51.531 --> 13:54.599
(sighs):
Ah.

13:54.601 --> 13:58.002
You know, Donna, your abrupt
departure facilitated--

13:58.004 --> 14:01.940
which means "led to"--
a breakthrough with Cleveland.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.441
I think giving him
a little freedom

14:03.443 --> 14:05.476
might actually
solidify your bond.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.278
Are you sure?
But I thought...

14:07.280 --> 14:08.947
Do not argue
with the man!

14:08.949 --> 14:10.014
He's a doctor,
kinda!

14:10.016 --> 14:11.349
Thank you.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.684
We'll see you
in a week.

14:12.686 --> 14:13.918
(door opens, closes)

14:15.688 --> 14:17.021
Wait two days
before you cash that check.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.961
Wait 20 minutes before
you go into that bathroom.

14:33.572 --> 14:35.240
Cleveland,
you've been bouncing

14:35.242 --> 14:36.407
on that trampoline
for three hours.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.676
Donna, what has Dr. Nerse

14:38.678 --> 14:41.246
been telling us
the past few sessions?

14:41.248 --> 14:43.514
(sighs) To support
your inner child,

14:43.516 --> 14:45.984
because your
father never did.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.418
Right.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.053
Jordan! Ah!

14:49.055 --> 14:50.154
Say it, say it.

14:50.156 --> 14:51.422
Swish.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.557
There it is!

14:52.559 --> 14:53.658
(bottles clinking)

14:53.660 --> 14:55.593
Morning, sir.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.664
I assume everything has been
to your satisfaction thus far?

14:59.666 --> 15:00.999
What are you
doing in my room?

15:01.001 --> 15:02.533
Restocking.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.668
But I only had
one or two treats.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.170
Your wastebasket
disagrees, sir.

15:07.873 --> 15:09.941
(crying):
I have a problem!

15:09.943 --> 15:11.709
Well, here's another one.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.245
$1,300.89?!

15:14.247 --> 15:15.880
That's ridiculous!

15:15.882 --> 15:17.048
How am I going
to pay for that?!

15:17.050 --> 15:18.683
No idea.

15:18.685 --> 15:21.619
Of course,
I'd stop eating if I were you.

15:22.688 --> 15:23.888
Right, right, stop eating.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.524
Oh, who am I kidding?

15:26.526 --> 15:29.060
I'm in the 'Blerone Zone.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.828
But this is it.
I swear.

15:33.465 --> 15:36.067
How are you doing that?

15:36.069 --> 15:37.268
(screams)

15:37.270 --> 15:38.102
(laughs)

15:38.104 --> 15:41.639
(panting)

15:44.310 --> 15:46.511
Why can't I quit you?

15:48.447 --> 15:50.048
(groans)

15:52.952 --> 15:54.919
Dr. Nerse, this is
how he dressed

15:54.921 --> 15:56.120
for my niece's baptism
yesterday.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.889
Jesus is a
Cowboys fan.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.558
Jesus loves soccer!

16:00.560 --> 16:02.493
Donna, Cleveland is correct.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.795
Jesus is a Cowboys fan.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.497
Thank you, Dr. Nerse.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.966
Wait in the car, Donna.

16:07.968 --> 16:09.500
The men need to talk.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.938
(door opens, closes)

16:13.940 --> 16:15.807
Doc, you're a miracle worker.

16:15.809 --> 16:17.475
Eh, I'm glad you're happy
with the results, Cleveland.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.812
But I'm afraid there's
been a price increase.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.413
Whatever it is,
I'll pay it.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.816
What'd it go up
to? 101, 103?

16:24.818 --> 16:26.985
It's gone up to coming over
Saturday night

16:26.987 --> 16:28.753
and sleeping with my wife.

16:28.755 --> 16:30.521
I beg your
you-got-to-be-(beep)-me?

16:30.523 --> 16:33.157
My wife has always wanted
to have sex with a black man.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.759
And like most Jews,
I only know one black person.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.128
And that's you.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.763
You know, Doc,
I think my marriage

16:38.765 --> 16:40.098
is feeling all better now.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.766
So, this will be all...

16:41.768 --> 16:44.135
If you don't sleep
with my wife,

16:44.137 --> 16:45.703
I'll have no choice
but to tell Donna

16:45.705 --> 16:47.005
you bribed me.

16:47.007 --> 16:47.972
(gulps)
I see.

16:47.974 --> 16:50.375
Let me ask you,
Cleveland,

16:50.377 --> 16:53.011
how would that
make her feel, hmm?

16:53.013 --> 16:55.313
Happy or sad?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.714
Sad.
That's right.

16:56.716 --> 16:57.515
So, you'll do
what I say.

16:57.517 --> 17:00.284
Okay.

17:00.286 --> 17:03.621
(whimpering)

17:03.623 --> 17:05.323
(snoring)

17:05.325 --> 17:07.825
(whimpering)

17:07.827 --> 17:09.794
(snoring)

17:09.796 --> 17:14.132
(whimpering)

17:14.134 --> 17:15.366
(snoring)

17:15.368 --> 17:18.002
Now, be careful,
I got pancakes in there.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.537
Absolutely, ma'am.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.905
I'll bring them
up to your room

17:20.907 --> 17:22.874
after you settle in.

17:22.876 --> 17:23.674
I hope you're
here to pay me.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.810
I am.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.645
But I'm not paying with money.

17:27.647 --> 17:28.146
I'm paying with the law!

17:29.715 --> 17:34.218
It's says,
"Not for resale."

17:34.220 --> 17:35.253
(gulps)

17:35.255 --> 17:36.587
Rallo Tubbs,
you're guilty of

17:36.589 --> 17:38.856
over 1,200 counts
of reselling a food item

17:38.858 --> 17:41.325
that is not for resale.

17:41.327 --> 17:42.660
You'll never get me!

17:44.329 --> 17:46.264
(grunting)

17:48.000 --> 17:49.600
Please, Junior,
I'll do anything.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.769
Just don't turn me in,
I can't go back.

17:51.771 --> 17:55.106
Everything about me
is much too pretty.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.675
All right,
but under one condition.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.110
You name it.

17:59.112 --> 18:00.845
Give me full custody
of the fridge,

18:00.847 --> 18:03.614
erase all my debt, and
shave one of those fake parts

18:03.616 --> 18:05.716
in your Afro like
Arnold Drummond had.

18:05.718 --> 18:06.284
Who?
Gary Coleman!

18:08.253 --> 18:09.954
Wow.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.156
All that sadness,
and now forgotten.

18:15.627 --> 18:18.229
Oh, my God, I can't
(whistle) my therapist's wife!

18:18.231 --> 18:22.900
But my therapist won't let me
not (honk) my
therapist's wife!

18:22.902 --> 18:26.037
What if you
just lightly (steam
whistle) her (cat screeching)?

18:26.039 --> 18:27.705
Not even that.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.141
I made a vow never
to cheat on Donna.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.377
Although, what if
I rewrote the vows?

18:33.379 --> 18:34.479
Been down that road.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.047
Landed you in treatment.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.482
Gabriel Byrne. David Byrne.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.616
Burning down the house.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.951
<i>Bringing Down the House.</i>

18:39.953 --> 18:41.619
Queen Latifah. Queen.
Freddy...

18:43.956 --> 18:45.590
Much better.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.326
Look, the reason Donna
took you to counseling

18:48.328 --> 18:50.061
was to save
your marriage.

18:50.063 --> 18:51.162
And now the only way
to save your marriage

18:51.164 --> 18:53.097
is to sleep
with this woman.

18:53.099 --> 18:57.001
Cleveland, unlike the
gays, you have no choice.

18:57.003 --> 18:58.769
Lester!

18:58.771 --> 19:01.806
They did not give us this
platform to spread ignorance.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.610
But for Donna's sake,
I will not
spend the night or cuddle.

19:05.612 --> 19:08.880
Oh, who am I kidding?
I'm a cuddler.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.151
Now, Cleveland,
my wife isn't looking

19:13.153 --> 19:14.952
for anything
kinky or weird.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.455
Can I do it with my
underwear and tube socks on?

19:17.457 --> 19:19.257
Yeah, however
you guys do it.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.060
WOMAN:
You're late.

19:24.129 --> 19:25.663
I like that.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.430
It's authentic.

19:26.432 --> 19:27.398
Thank you.

19:34.106 --> 19:35.640
(moaning)

19:35.642 --> 19:37.775
(grunts)
What am I doing?!

19:37.777 --> 19:41.012
I, Cleveland Brown,
love my wife.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.513
But even more than that,

19:42.515 --> 19:43.981
I respect her.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.150
And I will not
be unfaithful to her

19:46.152 --> 19:48.619
as long as we both shall live.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.623
I will no longer lie to her,
nor will I lie with you.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.358
Nor be on my knees,

19:54.360 --> 19:56.928
nor assume any type
of wheelbarrow position.

19:58.163 --> 20:00.965
I am a happily married man.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.968
And a pretty happy guy.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.370
And that's therapy.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.407
And those are the vows
I wanted to hear.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.242
Dr. Nerse, Donna!

20:11.244 --> 20:13.010
What are you doing
in this bedroom?!

20:13.012 --> 20:14.912
Are you sleeping
with the therapist

20:14.914 --> 20:16.047
to save our marriage?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.149
Oh, Donna.

20:18.151 --> 20:19.817
No, Cleveland,
don't you see?

20:19.819 --> 20:21.986
This was all a scheme
so that you'd realize

20:21.988 --> 20:23.754
your true feelings
for Donna.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.590
Well, how about that.

20:25.592 --> 20:27.558
It took you longer than
most patients.

20:27.560 --> 20:30.328
Most men feel too guilty
to pay a bribe

20:30.330 --> 20:32.363
to gain a tactical advantage
in their marriage.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.165
What?
Not me.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.400
I knew you would never
betray me, Cleveland.

20:39.871 --> 20:44.208
Does your wife want to
have sex with a black  <i>woman?</i>

20:44.210 --> 20:46.410
(laughter)

20:46.412 --> 20:48.412
We had a lot
of fun tonight,

20:48.414 --> 20:51.282
but there's nothing funny
about marriage counseling.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.783
It's a waste of
everyone's money

20:52.785 --> 20:56.687
and they always
side with the wife.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.990
Happy Valentine's Day,
everybody!
