00:02.560 --> 00:05.280
Would you want to grow up here?
I have to.

00:05.280 --> 00:06.600
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.600 --> 00:10.680
I was just an average kid
until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.880 --> 00:16.800
One minute I'm walking home,
the next, there's a crash

00:16.800 --> 00:19.920
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.800
And since then...
nothing's been the same.

00:37.640 --> 00:41.000
My best friend Ray
think it's cool.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.520
And my sister Annie
thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.880
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.080
Not even my parents.

00:51.160 --> 00:54.320
I know the Chemical Plant
wants to find me

00:54.320 --> 00:56.200
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.200 --> 00:57.440
But you know something?

00:57.440 --> 01:00.920
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:00.920 --> 01:04.200
[bell ringing]

01:37.520 --> 01:39.520
[girl grunts]

01:59.520 --> 02:00.770
Alex?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.240
- Hi, Jerry.
- How you doing?

02:05.240 --> 02:06.880
Have you reconsidered?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.280
No, I am not going to reconsider.

02:09.280 --> 02:12.880
But thanks, anyway.
It was nice of you to ask.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.800
Alex, I know we don't
know each other well...

02:15.800 --> 02:17.840
We don't know each other at all.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.960
True.
But if you don't go with me

02:19.960 --> 02:21.360
who will you go with?

02:21.360 --> 02:24.360
I don't mean to sound rude,
Jerry, but...

02:24.360 --> 02:27.000
- Isn't that my business?
- Sure, of course.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.080
I just want you to know that

02:29.080 --> 02:32.000
If things don't go
exactly the way you want

02:32.000 --> 02:34.840
I'm here... for now.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.840
What's up with you and Jerry?

02:40.840 --> 02:42.600
He asked me to the dance, again.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.000
Apparently three NOs
weren't enough.

02:45.000 --> 02:49.280
Well, it's not like guys are
beating down your door to ask you.

02:49.280 --> 02:50.640
[rattling door]

02:50.640 --> 02:53.760
Alex... this isn't even your locker.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.080
[girl 2] I'll drop the book
by your place tomorrow.

03:00.840 --> 03:02.320
Come on, Alex.

03:02.320 --> 03:05.880
This guy's in eighth grade.
And he's taken.

03:05.880 --> 03:09.280
Why is he with Jessica?
She's so...

03:09.280 --> 03:11.680
- [shivers]
- evil.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.960
Oh, not to him;
she's nice to him.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.520
I've seen them together.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.200
I don't think she's very smart, either.

03:18.200 --> 03:19.480
I'll tell Scott.

03:19.480 --> 03:22.080
I'm sure it'll make all the difference.

03:24.880 --> 03:27.800
You got to go.
There's no way out of it.

03:27.800 --> 03:30.400
It's very uncool
to go without a date.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.120
Who says you have to
go without a date?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.520
We could go together.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.640
Come on, Ray, we've been
best friends forever.

03:37.640 --> 03:41.160
That'd be like going with
my brother or something.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.360
- You know what I mean, right?
- Yeah, definitely.

03:47.200 --> 03:48.880
See ya.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.960
No problem.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.520
- Hand me that wrench.
- Hold on, Dad...

03:55.520 --> 03:58.640
I got to talk to you
about something.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.240
Uh-oh.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.800
I get nervous when you
get serious like this.

04:05.080 --> 04:08.120
It's about Alex.
We've been best buddies

04:08.120 --> 04:11.600
ever since we were playing
in a sandbox, right?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.720
Yeah.
And today...

04:13.720 --> 04:16.959
- this weird thing happened.
- Uh-oh.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.839
Dad, will you stop saying
"uh-oh" till I get to my point?

04:20.839 --> 04:22.120
Sorry.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.400
See, nobody invited her to
the big school dance on Saturday.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.960
Except for this one kid.

04:27.960 --> 04:31.160
And I know she was
feeling bad about it.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.600
So I invited her.
Well, you did the right thing.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.480
Now hand me that wrench.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.960
And she didn't
want to go with me.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.600
I didn't mean it as a big thing.

04:41.600 --> 04:45.800
I didn't want anything
to come between our friendship.

04:45.800 --> 04:48.400
But... it felt kind of funny.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.680
Ray...

04:53.040 --> 04:55.720
In your life,
you're going to go through

04:55.720 --> 04:58.640
a lot of confusing
situations with women.

04:58.640 --> 05:01.240
You're not going
to understand them

05:01.240 --> 05:03.320
they're not going
to understand you

05:03.320 --> 05:06.000
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.720
That's just the way it is.

05:07.720 --> 05:11.760
There's no point wasting time
trying to figure it out.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.720
- Dad.
- Yeah.

05:15.720 --> 05:19.200
- What are you talking about?
- I have no idea.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.240
[chuckling]
Hand me that wrench, son.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.080
Let's get back to this car.
Wrench!

05:25.080 --> 05:27.040
- Wrench.
- Ow.

05:28.720 --> 05:29.440
Mom...

05:31.120 --> 05:34.280
- Do you know what time it is?
- Ooh, I'm sorry.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.960
Did I wake you girls?

05:35.960 --> 05:37.800
Well, now that you're up

05:37.800 --> 05:40.920
come down here
and look at this, quick.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.560
- Is that you and Dad?
- [Mrs Mack] Oh! Can you believe it?

05:46.560 --> 05:49.640
[Alex]
Oh, look how handsome he was.

05:49.640 --> 05:52.760
What could be so fascinating
at this hour?

05:53.680 --> 05:54.680
You!

05:58.080 --> 05:59.440
Look at us!

05:59.440 --> 06:02.840
[Mr Mack]
We had so much energy back then.

06:02.840 --> 06:07.240
Wish we could've bottled it
and saved it.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.680
[girls giggling]

06:12.680 --> 06:15.680
[Mr Mack] We haven't had
that kind of fun in years.

06:15.680 --> 06:18.600
[Annie] Of course not.
'Cause you're always working

06:18.600 --> 06:22.000
or taking classes
or doing something serious.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.760
Look who's talking!

06:23.760 --> 06:27.280
[Annie] Keep in mind
that the definition of energy

06:27.280 --> 06:33.320
is potential forces, inherent power
capacity for vigorous action.

06:33.320 --> 06:37.040
Do with that information
what you will.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.600
[sighs]

06:39.600 --> 06:43.400
One day you're going to tell me
which one of us is adopted.

06:43.400 --> 06:45.600
[chuckling]
Sweet dreams.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.360
Good night, honey.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.760
"Capacity for vigorous action."

06:50.760 --> 06:54.600
"Potential forces."
What's she talking about?

06:54.600 --> 06:58.200
That we need to get out
more together

06:58.200 --> 07:00.800
and get away from our work.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.360
How about...
we start Friday night?

07:03.360 --> 07:07.280
Friday night.
Oh, I'd have to cancel my yoga.

07:07.280 --> 07:09.400
Then skip japanese class.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.120
I have a meeting
of the Einstein Society

07:12.120 --> 07:14.160
which is really important.

07:18.440 --> 07:23.880
I think that Friday night
would be a great time to start.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.440
Yeah.

07:25.440 --> 07:28.040
Annie, when you were
in seventh grade

07:28.040 --> 07:31.120
- did you go to the big dance?
- No.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.720
I don't think you
should waste time

07:33.720 --> 07:36.840
worrying about one
meaningless social event.

07:36.840 --> 07:40.720
Your whole life is ahead of you.
Start thinking about that.

07:40.720 --> 07:44.000
Well, I don't think I'm going to go.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.160
- Nobody's asked you, huh?
- Wrong!

07:47.160 --> 07:51.240
Somebody asked me...
just not the person I want.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.400
Are we back to Scott again?

07:53.400 --> 07:56.960
He has no idea
how I feel about him.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.600
So just tell him.

07:58.600 --> 08:03.400
Or you could take the chicken's
way out and write him a letter.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.960
Hey, I can handle him face to face.

08:06.960 --> 08:08.960
I'm no chicken.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.600
"Dear Scott...
I know you don't really know me

08:12.600 --> 08:17.360
but... there's something
I've been meaning to say to you..."

08:18.240 --> 08:22.040
[Annie imitating chicken]

08:43.280 --> 08:44.720
Hello?

08:50.320 --> 08:52.600
Is anybody home?

08:58.560 --> 08:59.280
Hello?

09:05.960 --> 09:06.680
Hello?

09:09.440 --> 09:12.800
You are so cool.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.160
[door squeaks and slams]

10:26.240 --> 10:29.280
What are you doing down here,
Rico?

10:35.720 --> 10:40.080
Ah, here it is.
Catch you later.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.280
I'm not like you guys.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.080
I don't need
a dream date to have fun.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.800
I don't know
what you're talking about.

11:32.800 --> 11:35.040
I'm telling you, Scott, I saw it.

11:38.680 --> 11:41.160
- Hey, Alex.
- Hi, Scott, what's going on?

11:41.160 --> 11:43.960
Jessica claims she saw you
leaving my house.

11:43.960 --> 11:46.800
Do you have any idea
what's she talking about?

11:46.800 --> 11:48.080
No, of course not.

11:48.080 --> 11:50.400
She can get pretty weird sometimes.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.920
So, you going to the dance
tomorrow night?

11:52.920 --> 11:56.600
Yeah.
I mean, probably.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.440
I might have something else
I have to do.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.640
I don't know.

12:00.640 --> 12:02.840
Probably not.
Who knows?

12:02.840 --> 12:05.600
- Oh, you should definitely come.
- Are you going with Jessica?

12:05.600 --> 12:08.520
Yeah, but so what?
We're not exactly engaged.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.320
- So I'll see you there?
- Yes.

12:12.120 --> 12:15.600
Hey, listen, Alex.
What's with your tan?

12:15.600 --> 12:18.640
- It kind of comes and goes.
- Oh, I know, it's...

12:18.640 --> 12:22.080
an allergic reaction
to the sun or something.

12:24.160 --> 12:28.080
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.920
I'm watching you, Alex.
I know what you're up to.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.480
I didn't do anything.

12:39.480 --> 12:41.520
Hello, you're a seventh-grader.

12:41.520 --> 12:44.240
You don't have the power
to do anything.

12:44.240 --> 12:47.360
And if you do decide to
go to the dance tomorrow

12:47.360 --> 12:49.280
stay out of our way.

13:02.280 --> 13:04.520
- Hi, Robyn.
- Hi, Mr. Mack.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.560
George.
Cool outfit.

13:06.560 --> 13:08.440
Thanks.
Thanks.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.360
Glad you wore something
that'll hide the blood

13:11.360 --> 13:14.080
after Jessica gets
through with you.

13:14.080 --> 13:18.040
He asked if I was coming.
They're not exactly engaged.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.520
He may even ask me to dance.

13:20.520 --> 13:24.880
Optimism.
It'll kill you every time.

13:24.880 --> 13:27.760
[Alex] Dad, do you mind
just dropping us off

13:27.760 --> 13:29.440
outside the school grounds?

13:29.440 --> 13:32.680
[Mr Mack] Embarrassed to
be seen with your parents?

13:32.680 --> 13:35.880
You've forgotten
the overwhelming peer pressure

13:35.880 --> 13:39.240
kids our age are forced
to deal with, Mr. Mack.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.440
I guess I have.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.520
We'll stay out of the way
when we pick you up.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.880
[sighs]
You both look absolutely beautiful.

13:46.880 --> 13:50.720
Thanks, Mom, so do you.
We'll see you later.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.960
- Have a good time.
- Okay.

13:53.960 --> 13:58.360
- Bye.
- [funky music playing]

14:06.600 --> 14:08.880
Look at Ray go!

14:18.160 --> 14:20.240
Oh, come on, Alex.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.120
And you think I have a death mish.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.280
I know.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.920
Oh, no.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.360
Here he comes again.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.600
[zapping]

14:37.600 --> 14:40.400
[groaning]

14:40.400 --> 14:42.480
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.560
I'm going to the girls' room.
Be right back.

14:49.360 --> 14:51.760
[laughing]

14:53.960 --> 14:56.520
Oh.
Where'd Alex go?

14:56.520 --> 14:58.560
Oh, she's avoiding you.

14:58.560 --> 15:01.800
I know that.
Got to expect the worst.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.600
I totally agree.

15:13.960 --> 15:18.560
Nice, uh... tongue... thing.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.880
[disco music playing]

15:32.480 --> 15:34.720
[Girl]
Come on, Ray, you promised.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.080
- Give me just a minute, okay?
- [girl] Where you going?

15:39.760 --> 15:42.440
You look really great
out there, Ray.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.360
Want to dance?

15:45.880 --> 15:48.480
No, I don't think so.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.520
[Ray]
You're not having fun.

15:50.520 --> 15:52.640
This is supposed to be a party.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.280
I'm okay, Ray.
Get back to your girls.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.640
I'll hang out with you.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.000
Just because I like
the wrong person

16:00.000 --> 16:02.840
doesn't mean you should
give up your fun.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.000
Okay.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.400
But if you want to dance
just let me know.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.600
[Mr Mack] Go-Go Club was
probably not the best choice

16:15.600 --> 16:17.960
to reawaken our youthful energy.

16:17.960 --> 16:21.360
Probably not.
Now what?

16:21.360 --> 16:24.080
I don't know.
How about a cup of coffee?

16:24.080 --> 16:26.480
I saw this cute cafe
down the block.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.680
Sounds great.

16:29.120 --> 16:33.040
Alex, I just want you
to know that I've moved on.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.960
Congratulations to both of you.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.080
Are you sure you don't mind?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.680
I don't want you
to hold this against me.

16:40.680 --> 16:43.440
Robyn... please.

17:30.840 --> 17:34.800
I... I think I'll sit
this one out, ladies.

17:41.440 --> 17:43.760
Why did you even
bother coming, Alex?

17:43.760 --> 17:46.720
You haven't moved
from that spot all night.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.000
I know.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.800
For some reason, Scott buys
your little cute innocent act.

17:51.800 --> 17:55.040
But I don't.
I see all your little tricks.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.320
- Like what?
- "Like what?"

17:57.320 --> 17:59.920
Like that hyper blushing think you do.

17:59.920 --> 18:02.720
I don't know what
you're talking about.

18:02.720 --> 18:07.280
Go home to your stuffed animals
and stop embarrassing yourself.

18:07.280 --> 18:10.560
He's with me, okay?
Live with it.

18:19.880 --> 18:23.280
[general conversation]

18:23.280 --> 18:25.640
[conversation stops]

18:29.120 --> 18:31.760
[conversation resumes]

18:31.760 --> 18:34.920
I don't think that I'm
in the mood for coffee.

18:34.920 --> 18:37.320
I think I might not be, either.

18:37.320 --> 18:41.280
But... I know something
you're never too old for.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.000
[ripping]

19:06.360 --> 19:09.520
Well, what happened
to Jessica's dress?

19:09.520 --> 19:12.440
I don't know.
Want to dance?

19:12.440 --> 19:15.360
I mean, until she gets back.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.400
I guess so. Yeah.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.000
[Mr Mack]
This'll be great, honey.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.600
Some places never change.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.760
All right, best two out of there.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.920
Oh, help her.
Hi.

19:38.280 --> 19:42.200
[man on PA]
Welcome to Senior Citizens' night.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.320
No one under 60 admitted.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.840
Discounts for bowlers over 80.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.480
You have a good night now.

19:54.920 --> 19:58.000
[slow dance music playing]

19:59.640 --> 20:01.840
What are you doing this summer?

20:01.840 --> 20:04.240
I may have to get a part-time job.

20:04.240 --> 20:08.160
I guess you'll be on the
basketball team next year, huh?

20:08.160 --> 20:12.000
- I bet you'll be the star.
- Maybe... hope so.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.880
I know you probably don't
care about this, but...

20:14.880 --> 20:17.240
I came to all your home
games this year.

20:17.240 --> 20:19.000
You're really amazing.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.200
You're pretty cool
for a seventh-grader, Alex.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.760
Thanks.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.440
Jessica's beautiful
and everything

20:55.440 --> 20:58.000
but sometimes, you know,
I'd like to be able

20:58.000 --> 21:01.320
to have a conversation with her...
like this.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.720
What are you doing
dancing with her?!

21:13.720 --> 21:16.720
Calm down, Jess,
I was waiting for you.

21:16.720 --> 21:20.240
- What happened to you?
- Never mind that, I'm here.

21:23.200 --> 21:25.760
See you later, Alex.
Thanks for the dance.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.280
See ya.

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
Hey.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.080
Mind if I finish
this dance with you?

21:43.080 --> 21:44.960
Sure, okay.

21:44.960 --> 21:48.040
Think all your girlfriends
are jealous of me?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.840
Let 'em take a number!

21:50.840 --> 21:53.400
[laughing]

21:53.400 --> 21:57.760
[fast dance music playing]

22:04.880 --> 22:07.280
[crickets chirping]

22:10.040 --> 22:12.120
[zapping]

22:14.320 --> 22:16.840
So it wasn't so bad, after all.

22:16.840 --> 22:20.200
Not really.
At least I lived through it.

22:20.200 --> 22:23.200
The next one will a lot easier.

22:23.200 --> 22:26.240
[Alex] Did you get to dance
with everyone you wanted?

22:26.240 --> 22:27.800
Yeah.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.720
I did.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.000
I guess just because
you like someone a lot

22:33.000 --> 22:36.120
doesn't mean that
they're ready to like you.

22:36.120 --> 22:37.360
Maybe someday.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.640
My dad said there's no point

22:39.640 --> 22:42.640
wasting time trying
to figure this stuff out.

22:42.640 --> 22:45.640
I just happens.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.640
Maybe he's right.

22:47.640 --> 22:51.600
[woman laughing]

22:55.480 --> 22:57.280
Look at those people.

22:57.280 --> 23:00.120
Think I'll ever be that happy?

23:00.120 --> 23:01.960
Definitely.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.520
Next week, let's get
our tongues pierced

23:04.520 --> 23:06.680
and try the Go-Go Club again.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.760
They'd love that at the plant.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.000
[laughing]

23:10.000 --> 23:12.640
Oh, honey, look!
Look over there.

23:15.240 --> 23:19.560
- [zapping]
- [laughing]

23:19.560 --> 23:21.160
Cool.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.320
