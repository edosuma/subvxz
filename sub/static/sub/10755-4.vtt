00:14.880 --> 00:16.580
-Hello, Niles.
-Frasier, quick...

00:16.770 --> 00:18.459
...give me your museum
membership card.

00:18.494 --> 00:19.370
-What for?
-I just heard...

00:19.550 --> 00:21.658
...tickets go on sale today
for the exhibit of...

00:21.693 --> 00:23.550
...fourteenth century
Japanese netsuki figurines.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.710
Oh, then the
rumours were true?

00:25.860 --> 00:27.035
Hurry, hurry, I want to get there...

00:27.070 --> 00:30.160
-...before the line forms.
-Five seconds.

00:30.430 --> 00:33.030
Oh, just give me a minute, Niles.
Just sit tight, huh?

00:35.590 --> 00:38.345
And we're back.
Before we take our last call...

00:38.380 --> 00:40.989
...I'd like to remind you that
Mercy Hospital will be conducting...

00:41.024 --> 00:44.750
...free blood pressure testing
this Saturday on Whidbey Island.

00:44.950 --> 00:49.650
Hypertension leads to strokes,
heart disease and other maladies.

00:49.900 --> 00:51.440
So we should all be
on the lookout...

00:51.475 --> 00:54.300
...for symptoms like
shortness of breath...

00:54.510 --> 00:56.723
...quickening of pulse, irritability-

00:56.758 --> 00:59.310
Oh, will you just shove the
damn thing into your mouth!

01:02.810 --> 01:07.910
So let's all join together to
help defeat this silent killer.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.310
Roz, who is on the line?

01:14.520 --> 01:17.820
On line four we have Mac, who's
recently moved here from Australia...

01:17.990 --> 01:19.576
...and he's having a problem
with a co-worker.

01:19.611 --> 01:23.190
Hello, Mac, welcome to
Seattle, I'm listening.

01:23.400 --> 01:27.500
<i>Well, mate, it like your Shelia said.
I'm working with a real yob-out.</i>

01:27.700 --> 01:29.755
<i>He goes on and on
about things nobody...</i>

01:29.790 --> 01:32.600
<i>...gives a billabong about just
to show off how smart he is.</i>

01:32.830 --> 01:35.930
Well, you have my sympathy.
There's nothing more irritating...

01:36.130 --> 01:39.330
...than pointless and
pretentious erudition.

01:40.510 --> 01:44.110
My advice to you is to simply
avoid him, is that possible?

01:44.270 --> 01:48.470
<i>Not really, you bloody wallaby!
You're on right before me!</i>

01:50.830 --> 01:53.030
<i>Stay tuned for the Bulldog.</i>

01:57.530 --> 02:02.930
Well, that's one on me, or rather one
on me and my call screener, Roz...

02:03.130 --> 02:05.530
...whose ancestors were
once heard remarking...

02:05.680 --> 02:10.080
..."Oh, what a nice wooden horse,
of course I'll sign for it."

02:12.410 --> 02:16.810
This is Dr. Frasier Crane
wishing you good mental health.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.030
Gotcha!

02:19.280 --> 02:22.780
How many times have I asked you to
desist with your adolescent antics?

02:22.910 --> 02:26.510
-I've got a sense of humour!
-I mean it, I'll go over your head!

02:26.700 --> 02:28.900
Stop it, you're scaring me!

02:29.310 --> 02:31.818
Listen, you sleazy little lyme tick...

02:31.853 --> 02:34.410
...you do that one more
time and I'll cut you off.

02:34.630 --> 02:38.630
-And I don't mean mid-sentence!
-Stop it, you're scaring me!

02:43.020 --> 02:45.216
Do you believe these hijinks
I have to put up with?

02:45.251 --> 02:47.320
No. Who would have
thought it with a station...

02:47.510 --> 02:49.099
...whose current motto is,
"Yakkety-Yak, We Talk Back"?

02:49.134 --> 02:51.410
Oh, run along.

02:55.830 --> 02:57.783
-Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.
-Miss Costas...

02:57.818 --> 02:59.530
...I'd like you to meet my
brother, Dr. Niles Crane.

02:59.650 --> 03:00.991
-How do you do?
-Enchanté.

03:01.026 --> 03:02.750
I'd love to stay and chat
but I'm off to get tickets...

03:02.940 --> 03:05.940
-...for Frasier and me at the Japanese
netsuki exhibit. -You'll love it.

03:06.090 --> 03:08.790
I saw it in Kyoto. It's just such
a shame they're not letting...

03:08.950 --> 03:11.750
...the really rare pieces
out of the country.

03:16.170 --> 03:20.220
As my Japanese gardener says,
Maimoshi chikosho.

03:20.255 --> 03:22.170
Watch your mouth!

03:23.120 --> 03:25.220
Oh, you speak Japanese?

03:25.450 --> 03:29.850
Oh, I'll just retreat so that
I can be one with my humiliation.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.574
Oh Kate, can I have
a word with you?

03:35.609 --> 03:37.900
-I'm in kind of a hurry.
-Yes, well, it'll just take a moment.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.368
I seriously doubt that,
but go ahead.

03:40.403 --> 03:42.840
Yes, I've tried dealing with this
problem on my own but Bulldog...

03:42.990 --> 03:44.591
...insists on interrupting my show...

03:44.626 --> 03:47.240
-...with his foolish pranks.
-I heard.

03:47.420 --> 03:49.588
Yes, well I did not spend eight
gruelling years at Harvard...

03:49.623 --> 03:50.920
...to be mocked by that...

03:51.060 --> 03:54.260
-...juvenile jackass! -Shameless!
-Oh, he's beyond shameless!

03:54.470 --> 03:58.970
I'm talking about the way you manage
to get Harvard into every conversation.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.302
Well, I'm sure you'll mention your
alma mater too some day...

04:02.337 --> 04:03.860
...when it's accredited!

04:06.030 --> 04:08.414
Gee, you sure know
how to ask for help!

04:08.449 --> 04:10.730
-No, I'm sorry.
-All right, all right.

04:10.930 --> 04:13.609
-I know, I'll take care of it. -Just
make sure he understands that...

04:13.644 --> 04:15.830
You went to Harvard,
I know, I know.

04:17.350 --> 04:19.773
Hey, the key to this game
is the husky secondary.

04:19.808 --> 04:21.950
Jack, how can I put this
to you delicately?

04:22.070 --> 04:27.270
You're a moron! Shut up! You know
squat! You know less than squat!

04:27.450 --> 04:29.073
You and squat could
go to the movies...

04:29.108 --> 04:32.150
...and squat could wear
an "I'm With Stupid" T-Shirt!

04:32.360 --> 04:35.449
<i>You're awesome, Bulldog.
Way to nail a blow on Dr. Crane!</i>

04:35.484 --> 04:37.860
<i>-You are the greatest!</i>
-Yeah, whatever, shut up.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.241
Now, look, all you guys
sending in any postcards...

04:40.276 --> 04:42.240
...to win tickets to
the SeaHawks game.

04:42.430 --> 04:45.130
Do I need another picture
of the Space Needle?

04:45.360 --> 04:48.260
Chicks in thongs! Enough said?

04:49.140 --> 04:51.440
We'll be back right after this.

04:52.650 --> 04:56.750
Hey, what I just said, I'm sorry.
I meant to say women in thongs.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.905
-Stop busting Frasier's chops,
enough said? -Well I could, but...

05:00.740 --> 05:02.133
...see all these lines lit up?

05:02.168 --> 05:04.540
They're all waiting to
tell me how funny it was.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.758
Are all these callers
waiting to tell Bulldog...

05:07.793 --> 05:10.370
...how much they liked the
joke he played on Frasier?

05:10.560 --> 05:12.982
All except the guy on nine,
he thinks Bulldog sucks.

05:13.017 --> 05:16.260
-Because of what he did to
Frasier? -No, just in general.

05:18.260 --> 05:21.460
-So, what do you want me to do?
-If you think I'm going to allow you...

05:21.540 --> 05:24.208
...to publicly mock one of
our most respected hosts...

05:24.243 --> 05:26.340
...on air just for the
sake of higher ratings...

05:26.480 --> 05:30.080
...you and I are going
to get along just fine!

05:43.160 --> 05:47.060
Come on, Eddie, you love paté.
And this is the good stuff.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.739
-Uh-oh.
-Two syllables every homeowner...

05:52.774 --> 05:55.250
...loves to hear upon
entering the door.

05:57.540 --> 05:59.056
Would that have anything
to do with the fact...

05:59.091 --> 06:02.390
...that you're feeding my
imported foie gras to a dog?

06:02.550 --> 06:05.488
Well, I'm sorry, but it calms
him during the thunder.

06:05.523 --> 06:09.550
Oh, well, heaven forbid that
Eddie should ever work a nerve!

06:10.850 --> 06:15.150
When Niles gets here we'll
have sherry and snausages!

06:18.720 --> 06:21.420
That reminds me, Dr. Crane
will be a bit late.

06:21.630 --> 06:25.730
Your father asked him to stop at the
vet and pick up some pills for Eddie.

06:26.030 --> 06:27.380
I'm the one who's had a hard day.

06:27.415 --> 06:29.930
How come no one ever
brings me tranquilizers?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.690
I've often wondered
that myself.

06:33.080 --> 06:37.180
-Hello?
-Hello, this is Dr. Julius Irving.

06:37.470 --> 06:40.070
I'm calling for Dr. Niles Crane...

06:40.240 --> 06:42.940
...his receptionist said
he might be there.

06:43.160 --> 06:46.260
I'm sorry, I am expecting him
if you'd like to leave a message.

06:46.460 --> 06:50.068
No, no, nothing important. Some
of the boys here at the club...

06:50.103 --> 06:52.760
...have a little bet going
about "The Mikado."

06:53.380 --> 06:55.712
Well, perhaps I can help.
I'm Niles's brother...

06:55.747 --> 06:57.180
...Dr. Frasier Crane,
and as luck would have it...

06:57.340 --> 07:01.040
...I was in an all-male version
of "The Mikado" at Oxford.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.440
People still ask to
see my Yum-Yum.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.968
I don't suppose you
happen to remember...

07:07.003 --> 07:10.070
...the words to "Three Little Maids"?

07:10.690 --> 07:13.847
Well, let me see. Well,
of course my falsetto...

07:13.882 --> 07:15.590
...isn't what it used to be but, um...

07:33.280 --> 07:35.141
Dad, would you please be quiet?

07:35.176 --> 07:36.880
-I'm trying to settle a bet here.
-You sure are!

07:37.080 --> 07:41.380
Some caller bet Bulldog he couldn't
make you sing over the air.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.400
Sayonara, Doc!

07:47.080 --> 07:48.846
Well, Dad, I'm glad to
see that you're amused...

07:48.881 --> 07:50.980
...having your own son
humiliated publicly.

07:51.150 --> 07:54.350
Oh, come on, it's funny.
He makes everybody look stupid...

07:54.540 --> 07:57.040
...the guys in the newsroom,
Chopper Dave...

07:57.270 --> 07:58.856
That is not exactly
a miracle transformation...

07:58.891 --> 08:00.670
...when it comes to Chopper Dave.

08:00.820 --> 08:02.937
A man whose life work
consists of looking down...

08:02.972 --> 08:05.820
...at the freeway and saying,
"Crowded"; "Not Crowded."

08:06.400 --> 08:08.470
-Where are you going?
-To the station!

08:08.505 --> 08:11.200
Oh, come on, Frasier,
don't take it all so seriously.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.249
You know, we played jokes
like this all the time...

08:13.284 --> 08:14.300
...when I was on the force.

08:14.520 --> 08:18.020
The day they replaced my
bulletproof vest with a big lacy bra...

08:18.210 --> 08:21.010
...I knew I was one of the guys.

08:22.870 --> 08:25.585
Thank you, Dad. That
also clears up a question...

08:25.620 --> 08:27.570
...that's troubled me
for years concerning...

08:27.780 --> 08:30.980
...the night you were shot!

08:33.179 --> 08:35.446
The "Salmon" that's what you want...

08:35.481 --> 08:38.880
...to name our expansion hockey
team, "The Seattle Salmon"?!

08:40.090 --> 08:42.491
Why don't you take your two
IQ points, rub them together...

08:42.527 --> 08:44.890
...see if you can't start
a fire, beat it!

08:45.590 --> 08:47.681
-Hey, you're in the doghouse!
<i>-Hey, am I on?</i>

08:47.716 --> 08:50.290
Yes, take as long as you want!

08:50.910 --> 08:52.650
<i>Hey, Bulldog, you're the man.</i>

08:52.685 --> 08:54.610
<i>How about we name
them "The Bulldogs"?</i>

08:54.780 --> 08:56.557
Hey, you want to suck up?
Send money!

08:56.592 --> 08:58.780
<i>Wait, wait, wait, wait,
I got another one.</i>

08:58.910 --> 09:01.806
<i>-What about "The Lizards"?</i>
-I hate lizards, they're disgusting.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.610
They make my skin crawl.
You're an idiot...

09:03.730 --> 09:06.611
-...and you don't deserve to live!
<i>-You're the best, Bulldog!</i>

09:06.646 --> 09:07.930
Shut up! Back in thirty!

09:09.090 --> 09:13.790
-I warned you. -Hey, hey, clear your
jets. Kate told me to keep busting ya'.

09:14.090 --> 09:16.490
Said it's good for ratings. You
got a beef, take it up with her!

09:16.650 --> 09:19.850
-I don't believe you.
-Pete, what did Kate say?

09:20.010 --> 09:23.010
-She said you're a pig.
-No, before that!

09:23.520 --> 09:26.320
She said keep
raggin' on the doc'!

09:30.900 --> 09:34.500
-I want to talk to Kate now!
-She's not in. -Oh, very clever.

09:34.610 --> 09:37.510
"She's not in." Like
that'll make me go away!

09:39.210 --> 09:41.110
She's not in!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.496
I need a copy of our contract
with Nanette Stewart.

09:43.531 --> 09:46.180
What's Yum-Yum doing here?

09:47.290 --> 09:49.290
It's all right,
I can guess.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.220
You promised you'd put an
end to Bulldog's shenanigans...

09:52.380 --> 09:53.169
...and instead you encouraged him.

09:53.204 --> 09:57.580
You're cancelling "Pet Chat With
Nanette"?! She's been on for six years.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.880
Yeah, but she's been floating at
the top of the bowl for the last two.

10:02.490 --> 10:03.990
When I went in to
talk to Bulldog...

10:04.120 --> 10:06.020
...the phones were
lit up like Times Square.

10:06.055 --> 10:07.820
His fans love it when he zaps you.

10:08.020 --> 10:11.120
-So, you would have me ridiculed
for the sake of those hyenas! -No.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.441
I would have you fight back.

10:12.476 --> 10:14.910
He makes pot shots at you,
you come back at him...

10:15.110 --> 10:16.690
...in your droll, Ivy League,
"look at me...

10:16.725 --> 10:18.410
...I've got a thesaurus"
kind of way!

10:18.630 --> 10:22.230
-It'll be funny!
-Funny?! Funny!?

10:23.330 --> 10:25.173
I refuse to engage
in a battle of wits...

10:25.208 --> 10:27.130
...with a man who's
favourite t-shirt reads...

10:27.330 --> 10:30.030
..."Seattle Hooter Inspector"!

10:30.490 --> 10:34.690
-Afraid of the competition?
-I am a doctor, I went...

10:35.330 --> 10:37.131
...to medical school!

10:37.166 --> 10:42.430
I will not embarrass myself by
engaging in a grab for ratings.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.095
You just announced to
a half a million listeners...

10:45.130 --> 10:48.040
...that you are "filled to the
brim with girlish glee."

10:48.200 --> 10:52.000
I think the H.M.S Pinafore of
embarrassment has sailed!

10:52.120 --> 10:55.620
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to fire someone.

10:56.410 --> 10:59.410
Oh, God, she brought Spanky!

11:00.340 --> 11:02.540
Kate, this is not over!

11:02.740 --> 11:05.440
Do you know what your problem
is? You have no sense of humour.

11:05.620 --> 11:09.820
-I am sick and tired of people telling
me that! -Well, then, lighten up.

11:10.220 --> 11:14.220
I asked the Raiders' defensive line
to describe their tackling skills...

11:14.370 --> 11:16.270
...and here's what they said.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.489
Good evening, Daphne.
-Evening, Dr. Crane.

11:29.524 --> 11:31.300
-Did you bring Eddie's pills?
-Yes.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.368
And the vet gave
very specific instructions.

11:33.403 --> 11:37.840
"Take one tablet per hour or as
needed until trembling subsides."

11:38.600 --> 11:41.600
I'm sorry, these
are for Maris.

11:43.010 --> 11:45.410
Those are for Eddie,
here you go.

11:45.610 --> 11:47.910
I'll just hide his pill
in a bit of food.

11:47.945 --> 11:51.610
Like our Grammy Moon used to get
grandad to take his heart medicine.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.440
If he had heart problems, why wouldn't
he want to take his medicine?

11:55.630 --> 11:59.630
Don't think that nosy coroner
didn't ask the same question!

12:00.350 --> 12:04.350
Num-nums, Eddie.
Oh, he's a good boy.

12:04.930 --> 12:08.230
Normally I don't believe in popping
pills for every little upset.

12:08.265 --> 12:09.930
I quite agree!

12:10.230 --> 12:12.384
My nerves are bothered by
this constant thundering, too...

12:12.419 --> 12:15.030
...but I would never turn
to drugs to calm down.

12:15.430 --> 12:17.630
Oh, mommy!

12:19.900 --> 12:23.100
Hey Niles, you're not going to
believe what happened to Frasier.

12:23.530 --> 12:26.730
-Oh, I heard the whole thing.
-You listen to Bulldog's program?

12:26.950 --> 12:28.430
Yes, Dad, I can't sleep nights...

12:28.465 --> 12:32.250
...till I find out who hurled what
ball through what apparatus.

12:32.530 --> 12:35.230
No, no, no, no,
it was on at the vet's.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.968
You would think that in
a city with this much rain...

12:39.003 --> 12:42.020
...that people would develop
an etiquette about it, but no!

12:42.650 --> 12:44.193
They buy umbrellas that
are too big for them...

12:44.228 --> 12:46.250
...you have to walk into the
street to get around them...

12:46.450 --> 12:48.101
...and then they drive
too close to the curb...

12:48.136 --> 12:49.650
...so that you're sure to get splashed!

12:49.850 --> 12:53.250
And they wear brown
shoes with white socks!

12:54.760 --> 12:56.624
What has that got to
do with the rain?

12:56.659 --> 13:01.060
Nothing! But I mean, really,
get a fashion sense!

13:02.460 --> 13:05.186
-Well, I guess things didn't go
too well at the station, huh?

13:05.221 --> 13:06.460
No, they didn't.

13:06.950 --> 13:10.250
It turned out the station manager
is encouraging Bulldog's little pranks.

13:10.430 --> 13:13.730
Now she wants me to return
his fire on the air.

13:14.050 --> 13:16.149
Well, I thought the idea
was absurd at first...

13:16.184 --> 13:18.350
...but now I'm starting to warm to it.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.923
I say have at him!
He's grossly overmatched...

13:20.958 --> 13:22.380
...but he did bring this on himself.

13:22.560 --> 13:23.477
You know, you're right, Niles.

13:23.512 --> 13:25.260
If I have to fight cheap and dirty...

13:25.450 --> 13:28.650
...on his own turf,
then I will!

13:31.670 --> 13:35.170
-And what is that supposed to mean?
-Well, I don't think it's a good idea.

13:35.370 --> 13:38.270
You know, Bulldog's pretty good
at this kind of thing.

13:38.540 --> 13:41.640
-He's a funny guy.
-And, I'm not funny?

13:44.850 --> 13:48.150
-I don't believe this! -Well, now,
obviously Dad's forgetting the time...

13:48.370 --> 13:50.551
...you took the names of
our wine club board...

13:50.586 --> 13:52.870
...and turned them all into
wickedly derisive anagrams!

13:53.050 --> 13:55.650
"Sidney Ass Basket"!

13:58.940 --> 14:02.940
-Now, you see, dad, I made you laugh.
-No, I'm looking at Eddie.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.320
I guess he won't be
needing a second pill!

14:09.860 --> 14:11.444
Now, now, Frasier,
don't get me wrong.

14:11.479 --> 14:14.260
I think you're witty,
you're clever...

14:14.450 --> 14:16.383
...but funny's different.
Funny's somebody...

14:16.418 --> 14:19.550
...who makes you laugh with
your belly. Now, Bulldog's funny.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.158
Duke's cousin, Louie,
now he's really funny!

14:22.193 --> 14:25.150
He's like Jackie Gleason,
only loud!

14:27.650 --> 14:31.650
He makes you laugh so hard
the beer comes out of your nose.

14:32.580 --> 14:36.780
You know what feels good through
the nose? A warm cup of cocoa.

14:40.860 --> 14:44.060
I just may go home
for Christmas this year.

14:44.280 --> 14:46.385
You know, just because
I haven't caused anyone...

14:46.420 --> 14:49.680
...to blow beer through
their nostrils...

14:49.960 --> 14:53.560
...doesn't mean that I can't. Anyone
who can compose a clever ballad...

14:53.760 --> 14:57.460
...can certainly master the intricacies
of the whoopee cushion!

14:57.680 --> 15:00.134
Well, I wouldn't be too sure about
that. It's a lot harder than you think.

15:00.169 --> 15:02.580
All right, you just tune into
Bulldog's show tomorrow.

15:02.770 --> 15:07.270
Pop open a beer and prepare
for a Budweiser geyser!

15:09.360 --> 15:11.725
You know, Frasier, if you're serious
about that whoopee cushion...

15:11.760 --> 15:13.360
...I happen to have one at the house.

15:13.560 --> 15:17.260
Last year a disgruntled servant left
one on Maris's dining room chair.

15:17.460 --> 15:19.860
Fortunately for all of us,
embarrassment was averted when...

15:20.060 --> 15:23.860
...my little faun proved
too light to activate it.

15:29.260 --> 15:33.260
Well, it's six-thirty, sports
fans. That means it's time for...

15:36.390 --> 15:38.613
...our big SeaHawks tickets giveaway.

15:38.736 --> 15:42.090
Yes, my curvaceous and
bodacious assistant Darlene...

15:42.430 --> 15:46.230
...is rolling in our glittery
giant prize draw right now.

15:46.970 --> 15:52.470
Okay, Darlene, give it a good crank.
Whoa! Honey, I meant the drum!

15:54.090 --> 15:57.299
Here it comes, Roz,
the hilarity ensues!

15:57.334 --> 15:59.690
Okay, explain this to me one more time.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.587
You were the one who's
trying to prove to everyone...

16:01.622 --> 16:03.280
...you're so funny,
so why am I the one...

16:03.510 --> 16:04.855
...who had to put
the lizard in the box?!

16:04.890 --> 16:08.410
It was just as difficult to be
the lookout! Stop whining!

16:08.700 --> 16:13.200
Hey, look who's here. It's our new
boss lady, KACL's own Kate Costas!

16:13.390 --> 16:15.221
-Kate's there?
Oh, Frasier, Kate's there!

16:15.256 --> 16:16.990
No, no, it's even better.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.690
Even better that she will be
an eyewitness to my little jape!

16:19.860 --> 16:22.160
Come in, Kate.

16:24.080 --> 16:28.180
-Yeah, here we go, glad you dropped in.
-Hello, Bulldog.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.880
Hi, Darlene.

16:31.680 --> 16:34.880
Wow, look at that
mighty drum!

16:35.200 --> 16:36.648
Yeah, give it a good spin!

16:36.683 --> 16:41.200
Look at those cards going round
and round. Okay, Seattle...

16:42.180 --> 16:44.680
...and the winner is...

16:44.940 --> 16:48.040
-Hey, Kate, why don't you pick it?
-Okay.

16:48.380 --> 16:50.580
And the lucky winner is...

16:53.000 --> 16:56.200
-Something bit me!
-Oh my God! It's a lizard!

16:57.400 --> 17:01.013
-Man, it's got your fingertip
-Oh, God! -I'll get some ice.

17:01.048 --> 17:02.500
There it goes,
there it goes, there it goes!

17:03.180 --> 17:06.579
Stop that lizard, it has my finger!

17:12.700 --> 17:16.425
Roz! Any news? -Oh, yeah. They
sewed her fingertip back on.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.400
She's gonna be fine.

17:17.680 --> 17:20.403
Frasier, would you wipe that
guilty look off your face?

17:20.438 --> 17:22.180
-No-one even suspects you.
-Why not?

17:22.410 --> 17:24.040
Because you made such a big deal...

17:24.076 --> 17:26.109
...about how playing
pranks was beneath you!

17:26.280 --> 17:28.280
Oh, they're not only beneath
me, they're beyond me.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.913
I'm going to accept my limitations...

17:29.948 --> 17:33.800
...and be satisfied to merely
be witty and urbane.

17:34.410 --> 17:38.310
Even my most barbed
comments never drew blood!

17:38.600 --> 17:40.900
-Oh God, I feel sick.
-You do?

17:41.100 --> 17:42.580
When the lizard
threw up her fingertip...

17:42.615 --> 17:46.400
...who had to pack it in frozen yogurt
and rush it down here?!

17:46.790 --> 17:49.390
-I'm going to tell her the truth.
-What?! Are you insane?

17:49.510 --> 17:50.947
I've got to unburden myself.

17:50.982 --> 17:55.010
Frasier, you didn't start this.
You are the victim here.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.408
Why should you have to suffer
any more than you already have?

17:58.443 --> 18:00.900
-I'll keep your name out of it!
-Fine, do what you want.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.292
I don't know when I'll be
back in the office, Susan.

18:05.327 --> 18:07.700
Just cancel all my appointments.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.321
Is there any word on
who pulled this stupid stunt?

18:10.356 --> 18:13.600
I don't want excuses,
I want names!

18:14.300 --> 18:16.185
Will you hurry up that shot.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.000
-I'm in agony here.
-Kate...

18:18.240 --> 18:22.340
I see that your strength is back.
I brought you some flowers.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.433
What kind of raving psychotic...

18:24.468 --> 18:26.220
-...would do a thing like this?
-You know...

18:26.400 --> 18:30.000
...people use that word "psychotic"
an awful lot these days.

18:30.390 --> 18:33.490
A kid steals a candy bar,
suddenly he's a psychotic.

18:34.090 --> 18:38.590
I'm gonna find him and
I'm gonna crush him!

18:39.290 --> 18:43.590
Are you sure that's enough?
Make sure that all goes in!

18:44.000 --> 18:46.500
Call me if you need anything.

18:49.700 --> 18:54.000
Well, Kate, I came
here for a reason.

18:54.230 --> 18:57.430
Oh, let me guess,
someone park in your space?

18:57.620 --> 19:01.820
No, but if someone had,
I would have forgiven him...

19:02.910 --> 19:05.710
-...just as I'm sure you
will forgive... -Who?

19:06.320 --> 19:10.620
Well, I'm sure the poor
misguided prankster...

19:10.830 --> 19:12.426
...that perpetrated this evil deed...

19:12.461 --> 19:15.130
...really had no ill will
in mind. It wasn't...

19:15.330 --> 19:19.430
...his... or her...
You know...

19:19.800 --> 19:23.800
...that Nanette from "Pet Chat"...

19:24.510 --> 19:26.640
...she had a real axe to grind!

19:27.730 --> 19:29.730
-What?
-What?

19:30.220 --> 19:34.720
-You giggled.
-Oh, it was kinda funny.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.100
-What?
-What?

19:38.240 --> 19:42.740
-What's funny?
-Oh, I was just remembering...

19:43.340 --> 19:45.340
-What?
-What?

19:46.820 --> 19:49.920
Oh, oh, the shot's
kicking in, isn't it?

19:50.120 --> 19:52.067
Wouldn't you know,
it bites my middle finger.

19:52.102 --> 19:54.820
How am I supposed to drive?

19:59.430 --> 20:01.441
You know, Kate, maybe now
would be a good time...

20:01.476 --> 20:04.230
Now you know, life is so funny.

20:04.520 --> 20:07.276
One minute,
you're standing in a hallway...

20:07.311 --> 20:10.920
...the next minute you're
a poo-poo platter for a lizard.

20:12.570 --> 20:16.470
That's a funny word,
isn't it? Hallway!

20:18.710 --> 20:22.310
-You want to hear something
really funny? -And Bulldog...

20:23.300 --> 20:25.600
Bulldog's...

20:27.010 --> 20:31.010
Oh, see, now, you're starting
to get tired, I should go.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.220
Kate, Kate, before you go to sleep...

20:38.420 --> 20:41.320
...there's just one last funny
thing I want to tell you...

20:41.520 --> 20:43.320
O-kay!

20:45.350 --> 20:49.750
-I put the lizard in the box.
-O-kay.

21:00.820 --> 21:02.920
Oh, God!

21:03.150 --> 21:07.750
-It's alive!
-You what?

21:08.640 --> 21:10.068
Well, I, it was meant for Bulldog.

21:10.103 --> 21:12.840
It was all an accident,
I never intended to...

21:16.540 --> 21:18.540
Kate?

21:20.740 --> 21:22.940
Kate?

21:25.000 --> 21:27.300
Nurse!
