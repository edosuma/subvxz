00:14.625 --> 00:15.625
Come on!

00:16.250 --> 00:20.416
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-The party's just begun</i>

00:20.500 --> 00:23.958
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-Maths is so much fun</i>

00:24.041 --> 00:24.875
All right!

00:24.958 --> 00:27.083
<i>-Maths Party!</i>
<i>-Everyone</i>

00:27.166 --> 00:29.333
<i>-Party!</i>
<i>-Maths is fun</i>

00:29.416 --> 00:30.666
<i>We're the babies</i>

00:30.750 --> 00:32.125
<i>You're the big kids</i>

00:32.208 --> 00:35.458
<i>Teach us all the maths you know</i>
<i>One, two, three, let's go</i>

00:35.541 --> 00:36.375
<i>Zu ba!</i>

00:36.458 --> 00:37.791
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:37.875 --> 00:39.875
<i>The party's just begun</i>

00:39.958 --> 00:45.250
<i>-And we're counting on a real good time</i>
<i>-This party's number one!</i>

00:45.333 --> 00:47.208
<i>Maths Party!</i>

00:57.333 --> 01:01.625
<i>The babies are playing on the playground,</i>
<i>enjoying a beautiful day.</i>

01:04.041 --> 01:06.708
Hi, big kids. I'm Lulu.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.375
Hi!

01:09.333 --> 01:13.500
Come with me!
Let's find the other babies. Come!

01:14.583 --> 01:17.750
Here's Franny. She's so fast.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.791
I sure am. Cheetah speed!

01:20.875 --> 01:22.375
Cheetah speed!

01:22.458 --> 01:24.500
Silly Franny.

01:24.583 --> 01:26.000
Hi, Bail-Bail.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.625
That's Bailey. He's an elephant.

01:30.416 --> 01:32.333
Yep. I sure am.

01:32.416 --> 01:33.916
<i>N ho.</i>

01:34.791 --> 01:36.541
That means "hello."

01:36.625 --> 01:41.875
Tilly is a baby tortoise
who speaks a language called Mandarin.

01:42.875 --> 01:44.125
<i>N ho.</i>

01:44.208 --> 01:47.125
Okay. I found my friends.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.750
Wait! Not all your friends.

01:49.833 --> 01:52.916
We're not enough babies. Where's Kip?

01:55.041 --> 01:57.666
Where <i>is</i> Kip? We better go look for him.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.916
Yeah! This way.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.083
Come with us, big kids! Let's go find Kip.

02:34.041 --> 02:36.375
We can't find Kip anywhere!

02:36.458 --> 02:37.458
Oh no.

02:37.541 --> 02:41.000
Lulu will find him now!

02:44.750 --> 02:46.416
Not there.

02:47.875 --> 02:50.708
Not… not here.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.500
What are we looking for?

02:56.041 --> 02:57.041
Kippie!

02:58.916 --> 02:59.750
Kip!

02:59.833 --> 03:00.916
Where were you?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.875
Well, I'm looking for the What's It Toy.

03:03.958 --> 03:07.541
Yeah, he has a surprise for me,
but I lost him.

03:12.500 --> 03:16.250
The What's It Toy always has
what you need when you need it!

03:16.333 --> 03:19.833
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

03:19.916 --> 03:23.541
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

03:24.083 --> 03:27.375
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

03:27.458 --> 03:28.500
<i>-Does it swirl?</i>
<i>-Does it splurt?</i>

03:28.583 --> 03:29.458
<i>-Does it twiddle?</i>
<i>-Does it blink?</i>

03:29.541 --> 03:30.416
<i>-Is it rough?</i>
<i>-Is it smooth?</i>

03:30.500 --> 03:31.333
<i>-Is it brown?</i>
<i>-Is it pink?</i>

03:31.416 --> 03:32.333
<i>-Is it cold?</i>
<i>-Is it cuddly?</i>

03:32.416 --> 03:33.375
<i>-Is it nice?</i>
<i>-Is it mean?</i>

03:33.458 --> 03:37.125
<i>Is it something in-between?</i>
<i>Something like I've never seen?</i>

03:37.208 --> 03:40.833
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

03:40.916 --> 03:44.500
<i>What's it? What's in the What's It?</i>
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

03:44.583 --> 03:47.791
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>
<i>I want to know, and how</i>

03:47.875 --> 03:49.916
<i>What's in the What's It Toy?</i>

03:50.000 --> 03:52.833
<i>I want to know, I want to know</i>
<i>I want to know right now!</i>

03:52.916 --> 03:53.750
<i>Right now!</i>

03:59.416 --> 04:01.166
Stop, What's It Toy!

04:01.250 --> 04:02.166
Thank you.

04:06.666 --> 04:10.333
-Thank you, What's It Toy.
-I wanna see it!

04:10.416 --> 04:11.583
Oh boy.

04:11.666 --> 04:13.500
Maybe it's ice cream!

04:13.583 --> 04:15.333
Or a flamingo!

04:15.416 --> 04:18.000
No! It's a box of…

04:18.083 --> 04:20.083
bouncy balls!

04:21.833 --> 04:24.666
Well, you know what this means?

04:24.750 --> 04:26.958
-What?
-It's time to bounce.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.000
-Yeah!
-Okay.

04:30.625 --> 04:31.875
Here we go.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.208
Yay!

04:43.250 --> 04:44.916
That's what I do.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.208
-My turn!
-I want to go.

04:49.291 --> 04:51.333
Bouncy balls for everyone!

04:51.416 --> 04:53.208
Yay!

04:54.291 --> 04:56.250
-Here's some for you.
-Thank you.

04:56.333 --> 04:57.708
And some for you.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.416
Some for you.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.333
And some for you.

05:04.166 --> 05:09.458
Wait. I don't think we all have
the same number of bouncy balls. Look.

05:10.625 --> 05:13.916
Yeah, it's not fair
if we have a different number.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.125
Yeah, not fair, Kip.

05:16.208 --> 05:20.166
Well, everyone has <i>some</i> bouncy balls,

05:20.250 --> 05:22.166
so that's fair.

05:22.666 --> 05:23.500
<i>Bù.</i>

05:24.583 --> 05:27.833
Tilly's right. "No."<i> </i>It's not fair.

05:27.916 --> 05:29.000
It is.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.500
-Isn't.
-Is!

05:30.583 --> 05:31.750
-Isn't.
-Is!

05:35.750 --> 05:39.458
Let's not fight. It's not nice to fight.

05:40.458 --> 05:42.666
<i>Let's not fight</i>

05:43.708 --> 05:45.833
<i>Let's not fight</i>

05:47.041 --> 05:49.083
<i>It's not right</i>

05:49.708 --> 05:52.250
<i>So let's not fight</i>

05:53.041 --> 05:59.625
<i>Like the time you took my bouncy ball</i>
<i>And threw it hard on the kitchen wall</i>

05:59.708 --> 06:02.583
<i>But then you pushed me and made me fall</i>

06:02.666 --> 06:04.416
-I didn't do that.
-Yes, you did.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.791
-Did not!
-Did too!

06:05.875 --> 06:07.125
-Did not!
-Did!

06:07.208 --> 06:09.375
-No, I…
-You guys are fighting.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.833
-Oops.
-Sorry, Lulu.

06:10.916 --> 06:11.833
Sorry, Kippie.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.625
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:17.791
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:18.916 --> 06:24.208
<i>It feels so right</i>
<i>When we don't fight, so let's not fight</i>

06:25.416 --> 06:27.416
<i>Let's not fight</i>

06:29.166 --> 06:32.250
I'm sorry, Franny. I don't want to fight.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.250
Me neither, Kip.

06:34.333 --> 06:37.541
But, how do we fix this problem?

06:39.083 --> 06:40.750
Word Wally?

06:41.250 --> 06:44.500
Oh yeah! Hey, he always helps us!

06:44.583 --> 06:47.333
Word Wally!

06:48.583 --> 06:50.208
Wait!

06:51.083 --> 06:56.125
This isn't a word problem.
This is a "how many" problem.

06:56.208 --> 06:57.916
Yeah, Franny is right.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.750
But who do we call
for a "how many" problem?

07:04.750 --> 07:06.333
Where is he going?

07:08.916 --> 07:12.666
<i>Babies,</i>
<i>this is Word Wally's cousin, Maths Molly.</i>

07:12.750 --> 07:15.083
Hi, Maths Molly.

07:15.666 --> 07:18.875
<i>Maths Molly can help you</i>
<i>with any kind of maths problem.</i>

07:18.958 --> 07:22.333
Oh good! But what's maths?

07:22.416 --> 07:25.833
<i>Maths is numbers and shapes and more.</i>

07:25.916 --> 07:29.416
Can Maths Molly
make the bouncy balls fair?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.875
Well, let's go see.

07:30.958 --> 07:33.041
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

07:35.416 --> 07:39.583
Come on, big kids! Hurry!

07:39.666 --> 07:43.291
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

07:43.791 --> 07:48.083
Yeah. And I've got
a big problem, so let's start.

07:51.333 --> 07:54.916
That's how many bouncy balls I had.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.625
Big kids, how many is that?

08:00.666 --> 08:01.500
<i>One!</i>

08:01.583 --> 08:05.166
I see one bouncy ball.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.791
And that's how many Tilly and I had.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.166
Big kids, how many is that?

08:18.125 --> 08:18.958
<i>Two!</i>

08:19.041 --> 08:21.291
That's more than Lulu had.

08:22.708 --> 08:25.708
-Sorry, Lulu.
-Oh, it's okay, Kippie.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.208
Okay.

08:31.458 --> 08:34.583
That's how many I had. How many is that?

08:37.750 --> 08:38.583
<i>Three!</i>

08:39.291 --> 08:42.625
Three bouncy balls.
More than everyone else.

08:42.708 --> 08:44.750
Yeah, I guess that isn't fair.

08:44.833 --> 08:47.750
Yeah. We didn't all have the same number.

08:47.833 --> 08:50.166
Well, I'll fix that.

08:50.916 --> 08:54.458
-Fair?
-Yeah, Lulu. I'm going to make it fair.

08:54.541 --> 08:58.291
Now that we've solved this problem,
we can have a…

08:58.375 --> 09:01.333
Word Party!

09:01.416 --> 09:04.666
Yeah, but, well, this was a maths problem.

09:05.583 --> 09:09.375
Right. Well, I guess it's time for a…

09:09.458 --> 09:12.583
Maths Party!

09:14.291 --> 09:15.708
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:15.791 --> 09:17.208
<i>We did math</i>s

09:17.291 --> 09:19.375
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:20.291 --> 09:23.208
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

09:23.291 --> 09:26.666
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

09:26.750 --> 09:27.583
Yeah!

09:27.666 --> 09:29.291
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

09:29.375 --> 09:30.708
<i>We did maths</i>

09:30.791 --> 09:33.166
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

09:33.708 --> 09:36.375
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

09:36.458 --> 09:41.208
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

09:41.291 --> 09:43.833
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

09:44.416 --> 09:47.208
<i>We love maths!</i>

09:49.833 --> 09:54.875
And there!
Two bouncy balls for everyone. Yeah.

09:54.958 --> 09:57.458
Two for Tilly, two for Franny,

09:57.541 --> 10:01.083
two for Bailey, two for Lulu,

10:01.166 --> 10:03.208
and two for me!

10:04.291 --> 10:06.416
Everyone has the same number!

10:06.500 --> 10:08.333
Now, let's bounce!

10:13.166 --> 10:14.916
Here it comes!

10:17.291 --> 10:18.208
Go, Bailey!

10:25.958 --> 10:27.666
Look! Party-in-a-box!

10:27.750 --> 10:31.000
Oh, hey. Do you want to have
a bounce party with us?

10:32.625 --> 10:34.583
Oh, can we? Can we?

10:36.875 --> 10:38.041
Clickety Clock!

10:38.625 --> 10:40.583
What time is it, big kids?

10:40.666 --> 10:43.791
Is it time to party?

10:49.166 --> 10:53.041
-Yay!
-It's time to party!

10:54.916 --> 10:58.333
Let the bounce party begin!

11:06.208 --> 11:07.208
Got it!

11:22.375 --> 11:23.708
Party!

11:28.041 --> 11:29.666
Good one!

11:38.208 --> 11:41.458
Hey, bye, big kids.
Thank you for helping me.

11:41.541 --> 11:43.416
Bounce with us. Come on.

11:43.500 --> 11:46.541
-Bounce.
-Kip, you're missing the party!

11:46.625 --> 11:49.833
Oh okay. I've got to go. Bye. Bye-bye.

12:04.416 --> 12:07.625
<i>I'm happy to be flying up very high</i>

12:07.708 --> 12:10.458
<i>Here in my apple sauce sky</i>

12:10.541 --> 12:12.458
Oh hi, birdie!

12:14.958 --> 12:18.041
<i>A little birdie is a-flying with me</i>

12:18.125 --> 12:21.041
<i>Here in my apple sauce sky</i>

12:28.791 --> 12:29.916
<i>Bailey.</i>

12:30.708 --> 12:32.041
<i>It's time to eat.</i>

12:35.166 --> 12:39.625
I wasn't really flying.
I was using my imagination.

12:39.708 --> 12:43.666
Clickety says
it's time for our snack. See?

12:45.041 --> 12:47.666
-Come on!
-Roger that.

12:50.458 --> 12:54.041
Now, what would you like
for a snack, Mr. Bailey?

12:54.125 --> 12:56.416
Oh, I'd like apple sauce, please.

12:57.666 --> 12:59.583
It's my favourite.

12:59.666 --> 13:01.500
Coming right up.

13:02.750 --> 13:03.666
Let's see.

13:06.416 --> 13:07.250
Oh no!

13:07.750 --> 13:10.083
I think we're out of apple sauce.

13:14.625 --> 13:20.458
Bailey is sad, so now I'm sad.

13:20.541 --> 13:23.916
We need to find some apple sauce
for Bailey right now.

13:24.875 --> 13:25.708
On it.

13:30.375 --> 13:31.375
Not there.

13:34.250 --> 13:35.250
I'm okay!

13:39.416 --> 13:40.708
One more second.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.291
I'm okay again!

13:50.000 --> 13:52.958
Problem solved. Bailey's happy now.

13:53.041 --> 13:54.083
I am?

13:55.458 --> 13:56.291
Kip?

13:56.375 --> 14:00.458
These are just apples, not apple sauce.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.041
Right. I knew that.

14:04.125 --> 14:10.041
Maybe we can turn these apples
into apple sauce!

14:11.375 --> 14:13.833
But I'm not sure how.

14:16.750 --> 14:19.458
<i>Babies, I have a surprise for you.</i>

14:20.916 --> 14:23.708
<i>Meet our new robot, Cookitybot.</i>

14:23.791 --> 14:29.208
<i>Cookitybot can help you make</i>
<i>lots of foods,</i> <i>including apple sauce.</i>

14:30.625 --> 14:32.458
Hi, Cookitybot!

14:32.958 --> 14:36.000
<i>And Cookity can show you</i>
<i>what ingredients you need</i>

14:36.083 --> 14:38.750
<i>and how much of each ingredient to use.</i>

14:40.166 --> 14:44.666
Let's see.
We need one spoonful of lemon juice.

14:46.333 --> 14:49.708
And one spoonful of cinnamon!

14:51.125 --> 14:53.791
And lots of apples!

14:55.416 --> 14:58.041
We're going to make
our very own apple sauce!

14:58.708 --> 15:00.125
Hooray!

15:01.416 --> 15:04.291
I was sad, but I'm happier now.

15:05.166 --> 15:10.708
Are you happy enough
to do the happy dance?

15:10.791 --> 15:11.708
I sure am.

15:12.208 --> 15:16.000
<i>When you wanna cheer up</i>
<i>'Cause you feel a little down</i>

15:16.083 --> 15:19.416
<i>It's a whole lot of fun</i>
<i>To start dancing around</i>

15:19.500 --> 15:22.583
<i>Let your feet take you for a real fun ride</i>

15:22.666 --> 15:25.583
<i>Hop a little</i>
<i>Jump a little, go for a slide</i>

15:25.666 --> 15:28.291
<i>And in no time at all</i>

15:28.791 --> 15:31.333
<i>You'll be having a ball</i>

15:31.416 --> 15:34.416
<i>We can dance, dance, dance</i>
<i>To a happy place</i>

15:34.500 --> 15:37.833
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

15:37.916 --> 15:40.583
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

15:40.666 --> 15:42.458
<i>When we're dancing together</i>

15:42.541 --> 15:44.291
<i>We feel a lot better</i>

15:44.375 --> 15:46.875
<i>-Get snappy</i>
<i>-And get clappy</i>

15:47.375 --> 15:50.416
<i>Right away you're gonna feel happy</i>

15:50.500 --> 15:53.208
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

15:53.291 --> 15:56.458
<i>Put a big, big smile on your happy face</i>

15:56.541 --> 15:59.541
<i>Dance, dance, dance to a happy place</i>

15:59.625 --> 16:02.416
<i>Dance to a happy place</i>

16:04.458 --> 16:06.541
Dancing made me really hungry.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.583
Can we make apple sauce now?

16:09.375 --> 16:11.041
Yes, we can.

16:12.875 --> 16:16.416
First, a spoonful of lemon juice.

16:16.500 --> 16:17.333
There.

16:18.750 --> 16:21.208
Tilly, are you ready to add the cinnamon?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.458
There you go.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.625
Good job!

16:29.458 --> 16:34.833
-When is it my turn to help?
-Yeah, and what about me? Do I get a turn?

16:34.916 --> 16:37.375
Do you guys want to add the apples?

16:38.291 --> 16:40.500
-Yes!
-Yay!

16:40.583 --> 16:43.583
Oh boy! That's the most important part!

16:44.375 --> 16:46.583
That's a lot of apples.

16:47.125 --> 16:51.083
-So we need a lot of apples!
-Yeah!

16:52.083 --> 16:54.750
Take that one, give it to you.

16:55.916 --> 16:57.500
That one goes here.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.791
Okay.

16:59.875 --> 17:01.791
-Another apple. Thank you.
-Yeah.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.000
-And some more apples. Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.291
And even more apples. Thank you.

17:07.833 --> 17:09.291
-Guys?
-Some more apples.

17:09.375 --> 17:11.375
Guys, that's a lot of apples.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.958
Just like the picture says!

17:16.041 --> 17:18.833
I think that's too many apples.

17:18.916 --> 17:19.750
<i>Tíng.</i>

17:20.333 --> 17:21.916
<i>-Tíng!</i>
-Another apple.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.166
Tilly is saying "stop."

17:24.250 --> 17:26.458
But a lot of apples means a lot.

17:27.500 --> 17:29.041
Stop!

17:30.375 --> 17:34.083
You're putting too many apples
into Cookitybot!

17:34.166 --> 17:38.291
Yeah. We need to use
the right number of apples.

17:39.083 --> 17:41.500
Did you say "number"?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.583
Maths Molly!

17:47.833 --> 17:50.833
-There she is!
-Okay! Come on!

17:51.833 --> 17:56.708
Stay here. We'll be back very soon
to make apple sauce!

17:57.333 --> 18:00.458
<i>The babies are here</i>
<i>to use maths to solve a problem.</i>

18:00.541 --> 18:05.500
And when you do maths,
you have to stop and think.

18:05.583 --> 18:08.291
Yeah. Let's think, think, think.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.416
-That's one apple.
-Yeah.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.833
That's two apples.

18:19.625 --> 18:22.791
And that's three apples.

18:25.333 --> 18:28.458
That's a lot of apples.

18:28.541 --> 18:32.291
That's how many apples
Cookity says we need to make apple sauce!

18:32.875 --> 18:36.791
But I'm not sure how many that is.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.833
<i>Babies, when you can't tell</i>
<i>how many there are,</i>

18:39.916 --> 18:42.333
<i>you can always count to find out.</i>

18:43.875 --> 18:47.166
Big kids, can you help us count?

18:47.250 --> 18:52.666
<i>One, two, three, four!</i>

18:54.000 --> 18:56.416
Four apples!

18:57.291 --> 19:02.083
Now we know we need four apples
to make my apple sauce.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.833
We solved a maths problem!

19:04.916 --> 19:06.333
So…

19:06.416 --> 19:09.625
Maths Party!

19:11.958 --> 19:13.375
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

19:13.458 --> 19:14.875
<i>We did math</i>s

19:14.958 --> 19:17.041
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

19:17.958 --> 19:20.875
<i>We stopped to think the problem out</i>

19:20.958 --> 19:24.333
<i>Now it's time to jump and shout</i>

19:24.416 --> 19:25.250
Yeah!

19:25.333 --> 19:26.958
<i>We did it! We did it!</i>

19:27.041 --> 19:28.375
<i>We did maths</i>

19:28.458 --> 19:30.708
<i>We went down the maths path</i>

19:31.375 --> 19:34.041
<i>Maths makes you a supersmartie</i>

19:34.125 --> 19:38.875
<i>So we had a big Maths Party</i>

19:38.958 --> 19:41.500
<i>We did it! We did it! We did maths</i>

19:41.583 --> 19:44.500
<i>We love maths!</i>

19:47.208 --> 19:52.291
Okay. We took all the apples
out of Cookitybot

19:52.375 --> 19:56.458
so now we can put
the right number back in.

19:56.541 --> 19:58.333
Okay!

19:58.833 --> 20:00.333
Apple!

20:01.875 --> 20:02.833
One.

20:04.666 --> 20:06.208
Two.

20:06.291 --> 20:07.208
And…

20:08.041 --> 20:09.125
Three.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.416
And…

20:11.500 --> 20:12.583
Four!

20:12.666 --> 20:14.583
Four apples!

20:14.666 --> 20:16.250
-Yay!
-Yeah!

20:16.333 --> 20:19.666
-Hey, shall I push the cook button?
-Yeah.

20:19.750 --> 20:21.000
Oh boy!

20:27.083 --> 20:29.333
Cookitybot is mixing!

20:33.500 --> 20:36.000
Cookitybot is cooking!

20:48.916 --> 20:53.125
It's perfect! Thank you, Cookitybot.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.000
Done.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.625
-Done!
-Done!

21:03.000 --> 21:04.208
And done.

21:05.375 --> 21:07.958
That was the best apple sauce
I've ever had.

21:08.041 --> 21:09.291
Good!

21:10.958 --> 21:12.208
I'm so lucky.

21:12.291 --> 21:15.416
Why? Because you just had
the best apple sauce?

21:15.500 --> 21:16.958
Well, yeah, that.

21:17.041 --> 21:21.000
But also because my best friends
helped me make it.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.375
Aw, Bailey.

21:22.458 --> 21:24.875
We like it when you are happy,

21:24.958 --> 21:28.500
and you are happy
when you have your apple--

21:28.583 --> 21:29.416
Bail-Bail?

21:30.666 --> 21:32.041
Where are you going?

21:32.791 --> 21:33.875
Sorry, Lulu.

21:33.958 --> 21:37.500
All this apple sauce talk
makes me want to sing.

21:38.833 --> 21:39.833
Is that okay?

21:40.416 --> 21:41.708
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:42.916 --> 21:43.750
-Bye.
-Bye.

21:44.916 --> 21:48.375
-I know what he's going to sing.
-Me too.

21:48.458 --> 21:49.791
Me three. And…

21:51.083 --> 21:53.166
Yeah, and Tilly makes four.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.625
<i>I'm happy to be sitting under a tree</i>

22:01.708 --> 22:04.500
<i>Watching the clouds roll by</i>

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
<i>I look up and see birdies waving at me</i>

22:08.500 --> 22:11.291
<i>Under an apple sauce sky</i>

22:11.375 --> 22:14.833
<i>I'll giggle and wiggle</i>
<i>And trumpet my trunk</i>

22:14.916 --> 22:17.125
<i>So happy I let out a sigh</i>

22:17.916 --> 22:21.666
<i>Glad to be by myself</i>
<i>With my dreams flying high</i>

22:21.750 --> 22:24.000
<i>Under an apple sauce sky</i>

22:24.916 --> 22:30.458
<i>A sweet honeybee is a-buzzing at me</i>
<i>As butterfly wings flutter by</i>

22:31.166 --> 22:34.875
<i>Trying to tickle my toes</i>
<i>'Cause anything goes</i>

22:34.958 --> 22:38.583
<i>Under an apple sauce, under an apple sauce</i>

22:38.666 --> 22:42.250
<i>Under an apple sauce sky</i>

22:46.708 --> 22:51.458
Thank you for helping us make apple sauce.
You're really good at counting.

22:51.541 --> 22:54.291
Bye-bye. Come back soon.
