Paige Dunkeley.

00:20.917 --> 00:24.610
Yeah "Whole Way Hanno,"
I miss ya, too.

00:24.714 --> 00:26.509
Um, I-I was just
wondering

00:26.612 --> 00:30.513
if you needed a relief teacher
this lovely Wednesday.

00:30.616 --> 00:32.204
No. Okay.
Well, if you do,

00:32.308 --> 00:34.758
you know where to find me.

00:34.862 --> 00:37.416
Suse! You catch the game
on the weekend?

00:38.417 --> 00:40.109
Yeah, round 10, smashed it.

00:40.212 --> 00:43.388
Hey, um, I'm just calling
about some relief.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.562
Yeah, yeah,
it's been a whole month.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.289
Toni can't say
I'm not consistent.

00:48.393 --> 00:50.912
You know, I-I'm quick
at adapting to change

00:51.016 --> 00:54.088
and open to any other roles.

00:54.192 --> 00:55.469
What roles?

00:55.572 --> 00:57.540
I'm not sure I have
the appropriate training

00:57.643 --> 00:59.473
to run a sex-ed class,

00:59.576 --> 01:02.717
but -- but I do have experience
in that area if it helps.

01:13.487 --> 01:14.557
Work?

01:14.660 --> 01:16.835
Kinda.

01:26.948 --> 01:29.192
What's with the phone?

01:29.296 --> 01:30.849
I'm working.

01:30.952 --> 01:33.438
Every time I turn around,
you're dit-dit-dit-dit-dit.

01:33.541 --> 01:35.336
That's a bit rich!

01:35.440 --> 01:37.787
At least I'm not...

01:37.890 --> 01:39.168
Uh, sorry,
wh-what is that?

01:39.271 --> 01:40.479
Checking your skin folds

01:40.583 --> 01:42.274
and tap-tap-tapping
on your fitness app.

01:42.378 --> 01:43.551
Well, it don't
look like that.

01:43.655 --> 01:45.208
You examine every inch

01:45.312 --> 01:48.211
of your body
every minute of every day.

01:48.315 --> 01:50.834
I have a running commentary
on your bowel movements.

01:50.938 --> 01:52.077
That's a lie
and you know it.

01:53.561 --> 01:55.287
See?

01:55.391 --> 01:56.633
E-mail. Work.

01:56.737 --> 01:58.256
Yeah, well,
you got lucky.

01:58.359 --> 02:00.223
I've gotta call Brody.

02:00.327 --> 02:01.914
Why, where you going?

02:02.018 --> 02:04.227
No, you're not
going anywhere.

02:04.331 --> 02:05.608
Release me!

02:05.711 --> 02:07.920
I've got to get ready.

02:08.024 --> 02:10.095
Well, don't change, Paige.

02:10.199 --> 02:13.340
I'm actually really digging
the homeless look.

02:18.241 --> 02:19.622
Maddy:
Adrian will be here at 8:30.

02:19.725 --> 02:20.933
I've given him a quick rundown
over the phone,

02:21.037 --> 02:22.349
but just give him
a tour of the house,

02:22.452 --> 02:24.005
introduce him to the kids.

02:24.109 --> 02:26.042
Oh, should I cook the fish?Fish, yes, but smell it first.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.457
I'm unsure of what's
happening there.

02:27.561 --> 02:28.527
Alright.

02:28.631 --> 02:29.942
Mwah!

02:30.046 --> 02:31.772
Mm.

02:37.053 --> 02:38.675
No, fold it up, Trav,
there's no time.

02:38.779 --> 02:42.334
Babe, I'm dying here.

02:42.438 --> 02:45.682
Ew! Mitchell used
my toothbrush again!

02:45.786 --> 02:47.684
-I thought it was mine.

02:47.788 --> 02:50.308
Oh, I am so late,

02:50.411 --> 02:52.931
but I love you -- mwah --
and I love you.

02:53.034 --> 02:54.415
Hang on, what time are you
going to be home?

02:54.519 --> 02:56.210
And I love you!

03:07.325 --> 03:09.982
Morning.

03:10.086 --> 03:11.536
Morning.

03:11.639 --> 03:14.124
What are you doing?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.954
Oh, thanks.

03:19.785 --> 03:21.408
That's your master plan,
is it?

03:21.511 --> 03:23.789
No. It worked well,
didn't it?

03:23.893 --> 03:25.515
There's loads of room
for improvement.

03:25.619 --> 03:27.207
Yeah, well,
I'm open to suggestions.

03:27.310 --> 03:29.485
Mm.

03:45.052 --> 03:46.226
-Hang on.
-You alright?

03:46.329 --> 03:48.089
Yeah.

03:48.193 --> 03:50.437
Roll over.

03:55.165 --> 03:56.960
Hey, hey.
Hey. Hey.

03:57.064 --> 03:59.480
Hey. Hey.

04:08.593 --> 04:10.146
Do you mind
if we just...

04:10.250 --> 04:12.493
Yeah.

04:12.597 --> 04:16.463
Let's take it slowly.

04:16.566 --> 04:18.948
Yeah.

04:31.340 --> 04:34.239
Tahlia: Okay, so flowers
on the table and the bar.

04:34.343 --> 04:37.622
We want a floral candelabra
at the entrance.

04:37.725 --> 04:39.348
We definitely want
a mirrored dance floor

04:39.451 --> 04:41.350
and two deck changers.

04:41.453 --> 04:42.661
-Deck changers?
-Yeah. We're gonna --

04:42.765 --> 04:44.732
we're gonna start inside
with a cocktail setup.

04:44.836 --> 04:46.803
We're going to move it to the
garden for an outdoor reception.

04:46.907 --> 04:49.219
With fairy lights.No fairy lights.

04:49.323 --> 04:50.566
Right, no fairy lights.No, no, no.

04:50.669 --> 04:52.292
Fierce elegance.
Got it.

04:52.395 --> 04:54.432
On it.
Totally know what you mean.

04:54.535 --> 04:55.847
"Fierce elegance?"

04:55.950 --> 04:57.158
It's us, babe.

04:57.262 --> 04:59.160
It's you and me.

04:59.264 --> 05:01.093
Is it?

05:01.197 --> 05:02.750
Do you mind giving us a moment?

05:02.854 --> 05:06.996
Of course.
Thank you.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.412
Now what's happening?
How are you feeling?

05:09.516 --> 05:10.965
If you don't love it,
just --

05:11.069 --> 05:12.277
just tell me.

05:12.381 --> 05:14.555
I want you to be happy.

05:14.659 --> 05:17.247
It's just -- if this
is our engagement,

05:17.351 --> 05:18.904
how big's
the wedding gonna be?

05:19.008 --> 05:20.803
Big.

05:24.669 --> 05:26.705
Hey, this tap doesn't
turn off properly.

05:26.809 --> 05:28.086
Oh, just put that bowl
under it.

05:28.189 --> 05:29.467
I'll use it
to water the plants.

05:29.570 --> 05:32.159
No, I can fix it.
You got any washers?

05:32.262 --> 05:36.715
Yeah. Um, Jack used to
keep stuff under the sink.

05:36.819 --> 05:40.340
Yep.

05:40.443 --> 05:44.758
So it's a bye-weekend,
and Tahlia and Connor

05:44.861 --> 05:46.000
are having
their engagement party.

05:46.104 --> 05:47.864
Ah, let me guess.
Small, tasteful,

05:47.968 --> 05:50.867
just a handful
of close friends and family.

05:50.971 --> 05:52.421
You should come.

05:52.524 --> 05:54.802
To an event?

05:54.906 --> 05:55.769
With you?

05:55.872 --> 05:57.633
Yeah.

05:57.736 --> 05:59.945
As what?

06:00.049 --> 06:01.326
My date.

06:01.430 --> 06:03.224
Some guy I'm seeing.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.503
Hey, does this mean...

06:05.606 --> 06:07.850
What?

06:07.953 --> 06:10.335
Queensland?

06:10.439 --> 06:12.544
You're serious?Yeah, I'm serious.

06:12.648 --> 06:14.339
Oh.

06:20.034 --> 06:22.002
Real clothes?

06:22.105 --> 06:24.211
Yeah, Brody and I
are talking school strategy.

06:24.314 --> 06:25.488
Well, all hail Brody.

06:25.592 --> 06:27.283
Geez, you look great.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.113
Right, well,
I'll leave you to it.

06:52.929 --> 06:55.415
-Speak to me.
-I think I'm being trolled.

06:55.518 --> 06:57.417
So, they liked
all my photos,

06:57.520 --> 06:59.039
and then I posted a selfie
this morning...

06:59.142 --> 07:00.592
Mmm, I saw it,
loved it, liked it.

07:00.696 --> 07:03.077
Yeah, and then they left
some ambiguous comment on it,

07:03.181 --> 07:05.217
and I can't tell
if they're joking or...

07:05.321 --> 07:06.322
What did it say?

07:06.426 --> 07:09.394
"...it's Friday."It is Friday.

07:09.498 --> 07:11.603
Yeah, I know, but my post said
"Sure feels like a Monday."

07:11.707 --> 07:14.295
Oh. Well, do they have
any photos?

07:14.399 --> 07:16.194
No.
Troll.

07:16.297 --> 07:18.368
I'm offended, but I'm not
entirely sure why.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.232
It's just --Block, delete, move on.

07:20.336 --> 07:21.924
Yeah, but --Do not agitate them.

07:22.027 --> 07:24.858
They move in packs.
They're like hyenas.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.825
Paige?

07:26.929 --> 07:28.448
Do not feed the trolls!

07:28.551 --> 07:29.656
You know what?
Nah.

07:29.759 --> 07:30.898
If they've got
a problem with me,

07:31.002 --> 07:32.382
they can unfollow me.Yeah.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.281
No, that is not
how it works.

07:34.384 --> 07:35.731
You're right. If they've got
a problem with me,

07:35.834 --> 07:37.111
they can say it to my face.

07:37.215 --> 07:38.941
Don't!

07:39.044 --> 07:41.150
Sent.

07:41.253 --> 07:43.463
Coming out
is daunting as it is,

07:43.566 --> 07:45.568
let alone when you're
in the spotlight.

07:45.672 --> 07:48.122
When did you know
you were gay?

07:48.226 --> 07:50.987
It's not like I wake up one
morning, and thought, you know,

07:51.091 --> 07:52.748
"I guess I'm gay."

07:52.851 --> 07:55.026
This is --
this is who I am.

07:55.129 --> 07:59.030
Brian Rickards prides himself
on being a hands-on coach.

07:59.133 --> 08:02.482
He didn't want to support you
through this?

08:03.862 --> 08:05.830
Coming out
was my decision

08:05.933 --> 08:10.248
and I wanted to
do it alone.

08:10.351 --> 08:12.906
It's got nothing to do
with Brian.

08:14.942 --> 08:17.911
It's got nothing
to do with Brian.

08:18.014 --> 08:21.121
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:21.224 --> 08:22.363
Listen, I --

08:22.467 --> 08:24.089
Yeah?

08:24.193 --> 08:26.229
Go, get it.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.093
Two secs.

08:28.197 --> 08:32.373
Hey, mate.

08:32.477 --> 08:34.893
What?

08:34.997 --> 08:37.793
No!
No idea.

08:37.896 --> 08:39.173
No, no.
It's alright.

08:39.277 --> 08:41.866
We'll deal with it.

08:41.969 --> 08:44.247
Hey!
What are you guys doing here?

08:48.424 --> 08:50.322
Jessie: You're kidding me.
I was hot.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.462
I took my jacket off
for like three seconds.

08:52.566 --> 08:53.878
Not your fault.

08:53.981 --> 08:55.293
Bloody paps.

08:55.396 --> 08:56.674
He's threatened to
sell them,

08:56.777 --> 08:58.538
unless, of course,
we pay him out.

08:58.641 --> 09:00.919
Look, the way I see it,
we have a few options.

09:01.023 --> 09:03.404
We can buy the pics,
give you some more time.

09:03.508 --> 09:06.235
Or we make a statement,
get ahead of the story.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.754
You're in your second
trimester.

09:07.857 --> 09:11.343
I know it's hard,
but you can't hide it forever.

09:11.447 --> 09:13.725
This way, at least
we can control the narrative.

09:13.829 --> 09:15.278
And we should discuss
how that's going to look.

09:15.382 --> 09:16.832
Jack and I have been trying
for some time.

09:16.935 --> 09:17.971
We have to
mention the club.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.351
I'll get Brian to make
a statement

09:19.455 --> 09:21.043
about how the Southern Jets
plan to support you.

09:21.146 --> 09:23.563
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:23.666 --> 09:25.875
Um...

09:25.979 --> 09:28.844
The baby's not Jack's.

09:31.709 --> 09:35.609
I met Nate about 18 months ago.

09:35.713 --> 09:37.577
We fell in love.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.613
Look, I know what you guys
are thinking, but it's --

09:39.717 --> 09:41.028
No. Did --

09:41.132 --> 09:42.996
did Jack know?Yes, yes.

09:43.099 --> 09:47.414
God, yes, he knew everything.
I never lied to Jack.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.659
Our marriage was...

09:50.762 --> 09:52.868
It was over.

09:52.971 --> 09:54.663
More or less.

09:54.766 --> 10:00.358
We were gonna separate
during the offseason, but...

10:00.461 --> 10:02.153
Oh.

10:02.256 --> 10:03.361
Honey.

10:04.673 --> 10:07.123
I just want this to stop.

10:07.227 --> 10:10.679
First Jack, and then
all the rumors with Rusty.

10:10.782 --> 10:12.197
I mean, what,
now I'm supposed to tell him

10:12.301 --> 10:14.441
I'm pregnant
with another man's kid?

10:14.544 --> 10:16.374
What do I say to JJ?

10:16.477 --> 10:18.445
You have nothing
to be ashamed of.

10:20.033 --> 10:22.138
You and Jack are the only ones
that know the truth.

10:22.242 --> 10:24.485
No one else has the right
to judge you.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.039
What do you want to do,
Jess?

10:26.142 --> 10:28.558
I can't hide this.

10:28.662 --> 10:32.701
Whatever you decide, we're
going to be behind you 100%.

10:32.804 --> 10:35.151
I know it's a really
big decision.

10:35.255 --> 10:38.499
We just don't have
much time.

10:38.603 --> 10:41.123
I don't know.
I have to talk to Nate.

10:41.226 --> 10:43.297
I can buy you 24 hours.
That's it.

10:43.401 --> 10:44.885
Thank you.

10:44.989 --> 10:47.854
Come here.

10:47.957 --> 10:49.407
You're not hanging around?

10:49.510 --> 10:50.891
I wish I could.

10:50.995 --> 10:53.307
Unfortunately, this pap isn't
the only pyromaniac

10:53.411 --> 10:54.861
I have to deal with today.

10:54.964 --> 10:56.828
See ya.

11:07.632 --> 11:09.013
Listen.

11:09.116 --> 11:12.430
Don't make a scene.

11:12.533 --> 11:14.604
You should see
the engagement party.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.503
Tahlia is in.

11:16.606 --> 11:18.954
All of her is in.

11:19.057 --> 11:20.127
I need to tell her.

11:20.231 --> 11:21.819
It would break her.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.269
It would break the club.
It would ruin your career.

11:24.373 --> 11:25.512
I don't care!

11:25.615 --> 11:26.927
I'm going crazy.

11:27.031 --> 11:29.861
I'm looking at flowers
and -- and candles,

11:29.965 --> 11:31.725
and all I can think
about is you.

11:31.829 --> 11:34.279
Don't you threaten me.
Don't you fucking threaten me!

11:34.383 --> 11:35.729
No one
can know about this!

11:35.833 --> 11:37.351
Do you understand?

11:37.455 --> 11:39.906
Do you understand,
Connor?

11:45.877 --> 11:50.537
This engagement party, it's not
your whole relationship.

11:50.640 --> 11:52.366
You're nervous.

11:52.470 --> 11:55.473
That's understandable.
It's human.

11:55.576 --> 11:58.683
Don't blow up your whole life
over it.

11:58.787 --> 12:02.583
You're missing my point...

12:02.687 --> 12:04.482
about me
thinking about you.

12:04.585 --> 12:05.759
It will pass.

12:05.863 --> 12:09.487
Footy isn't everything.

12:09.590 --> 12:10.730
I'd give it up for you.

12:10.833 --> 12:12.455
Well, that's the difference.

12:12.559 --> 12:14.492
I wouldn't.

12:33.891 --> 12:35.824
Maddy: Well, who is he?
How did you meet?

12:35.927 --> 12:37.653
His name's Nate,

12:37.757 --> 12:40.345
and his daughter bit JJ.

12:40.449 --> 12:41.864
What?

12:41.968 --> 12:43.901
I get this call
from JJ's daycare,

12:44.004 --> 12:45.592
and they're like,
"JJ's been bitten."

12:45.695 --> 12:49.389
So I race down there, livid,
I can't even remember driving,

12:49.492 --> 12:52.530
to find this guy
sitting in the office.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.532
All I can remember
is him laughing.

12:55.947 --> 12:57.362
Until I finally come to,

12:57.466 --> 12:58.570
and I've been
verbally abusing him

12:58.674 --> 13:00.883
for a solid 10 minutes.

13:00.987 --> 13:02.298
I'd pay good money
to see that.

13:02.402 --> 13:04.784
Well, bite my son
and you can see it for free.

13:04.887 --> 13:08.718
Anyway,
he asked me for coffee.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.342
And that was that.

13:11.445 --> 13:14.069
Yeah.
He's kind, generous,

13:14.172 --> 13:17.762
and I'm so in love
with him it's sickening.

13:17.866 --> 13:21.697
Oh.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.907
And, um, does he know
the baby is his?

13:25.011 --> 13:26.633
Yeah.
He's asked me and JJ

13:26.736 --> 13:29.015
to move to
Queensland with him.

13:29.118 --> 13:30.602
Get away from
all the press.

13:30.706 --> 13:33.640
Oh.
And all your friends.

13:33.743 --> 13:35.745
I'm not trying to
convince you to stay.

13:35.849 --> 13:37.851
But I just
want to be sure.

13:37.955 --> 13:39.991
Is that what you want?

13:40.095 --> 13:43.305
It really is.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.480
Then I'm
so happy for you.

13:51.416 --> 13:53.902
I hear on the e-mail grapevine
that old mate

13:54.005 --> 13:55.558
Silky Steve
got the boot.

13:55.662 --> 13:56.974
Well, he was offered a job
at another school.

13:57.077 --> 13:58.251
Awesome.

13:58.354 --> 13:59.804
Good for him.
Mm-hmm.

13:59.908 --> 14:01.944
I guess that means that there's
a full-time position

14:02.048 --> 14:04.360
just rolling around
waiting for good old Paige

14:04.464 --> 14:06.155
to snap it up.
Am I right?

14:06.259 --> 14:08.433
I'm sure Toni would love
to have you back.

14:08.537 --> 14:09.676
Jim, on the other hand...

14:09.779 --> 14:11.367
Look, I know
I'm not an easy sell.

14:11.471 --> 14:13.300
I stuffed up.

14:13.404 --> 14:14.854
Massively.

14:14.957 --> 14:16.821
But Toni backed me,
and I let her down.

14:16.925 --> 14:19.548
This is my opportunity to prove
that she wasn't wrong about me.

14:21.964 --> 14:24.173
I need this.

14:24.277 --> 14:26.624
Fine, I'll risk my life
and talk to Toni.

14:26.727 --> 14:29.385
Really?
I'm not making
any promises, though.

14:29.489 --> 14:31.180
I have to go head-to-head
with Jim.

14:31.284 --> 14:33.803
Ah, confrontation,
not my forte.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.598
We just need to get
your confidence up.

14:35.702 --> 14:38.291
I've actually called
a face-to-face with a troll.

14:38.394 --> 14:40.017
I'm gonna tell them
to stop.
Ho!

14:40.120 --> 14:41.742
I could never do something
like that.

14:41.846 --> 14:43.434
You're about to.

14:43.537 --> 14:45.885
The trick is to get in and out
without being mean.

14:45.988 --> 14:48.646
You can be assertive,
but don't engage on their level.

14:48.749 --> 14:50.096
Kind of like dealing
with 15-year-olds?

14:50.199 --> 14:52.477
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.

14:58.794 --> 15:00.278
Oh, that's not him,
is it?

15:00.382 --> 15:02.902
Don't think so.

15:03.005 --> 15:05.180
This way.

15:07.734 --> 15:09.770
Hi, are you...

15:09.874 --> 15:11.738
Izo.

15:11.841 --> 15:15.224
I'm Paige.
This is my friend Brody.

15:15.328 --> 15:16.812
Um, look.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.848
You seem like
a good person.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.505
Well,
we just thought...

15:20.609 --> 15:22.128
You might
have a problem with me

15:22.231 --> 15:23.888
and what I put out
into the world.

15:23.992 --> 15:25.303
What are you
talking about?

15:25.407 --> 15:27.547
You wrote
"...it's Friday."

15:27.650 --> 15:28.962
It is Friday.

15:29.066 --> 15:32.172
You're uncomfortably blunt
in communication.

15:32.276 --> 15:33.760
And you like all my photos.

15:33.863 --> 15:35.693
Well, I like you.You don't really know me.

15:35.796 --> 15:37.108
No, you do not.

15:37.212 --> 15:39.007
You're from Casterton.

15:39.110 --> 15:40.801
A school teacher.

15:40.905 --> 15:42.665
You want to help people.

15:42.769 --> 15:44.288
And you stood up
for Rusty O'Reilly.

15:44.391 --> 15:46.152
That was pretty cool.

15:51.122 --> 15:54.022
Hello?

15:54.125 --> 15:56.783
Oh, hey!

15:56.886 --> 15:58.854
How was your day?

15:58.958 --> 16:03.238
I have some bad --
No, unfortunate news.

16:03.341 --> 16:06.586
Adrian, our new nanny
is no longer.

16:06.689 --> 16:08.864
Shit!
Trav!

16:08.968 --> 16:10.590
He came
highly recommended!

16:10.693 --> 16:12.212
Just offer him
more money.

16:12.316 --> 16:16.630
Money can fix many things,
but not this.

16:17.769 --> 16:23.258
He may have walked in on me
in the midst of some...

16:23.361 --> 16:24.673
personal time.

16:26.778 --> 16:28.228
Wait. What?

16:28.332 --> 16:29.298
Where were you?

16:29.402 --> 16:31.059
Here.

16:31.162 --> 16:34.234
No, no, no, before you get
angry, just hear me out.

16:34.338 --> 16:36.236
It takes 10 minutes
to walk to the park,

16:36.340 --> 16:38.376
and then the kids play for
no less than 45 minutes.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.929
And then, it's a 10-minute
walk home.

16:40.033 --> 16:42.725
That is a luxurious
amount of time.

16:42.829 --> 16:45.245
I believe Adrian's
poor organization skills

16:45.349 --> 16:46.453
are to blame.

16:46.557 --> 16:48.007
If he didn't forget
Abby's hat,

16:48.110 --> 16:50.354
I would have been well
and truly finished.

16:50.457 --> 16:52.459
I cannot believe you,
Travis Cochrane!

16:52.563 --> 16:53.943
You think you're the only
one suffering

16:54.047 --> 16:55.359
from our lack of
sexy time?

16:55.462 --> 16:57.568
I am considering getting the bus
to work solely

16:57.671 --> 17:00.019
for the vibrations,
but I am handling it.

17:00.122 --> 17:01.296
And you should be, too.
But --

17:01.399 --> 17:05.300
Stop costing us
excellent babysitters!

17:07.716 --> 17:08.924
Final push!
Push, push!

17:09.028 --> 17:11.409
That's it.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.070
Looking forward
to the party tomorrow, mate.

17:17.174 --> 17:20.418
Ah, I'd be shitting myself
if I were you.

17:21.557 --> 17:23.387
It must feel good, bud.

17:23.490 --> 17:24.940
What?
Just, like,

17:25.044 --> 17:27.356
knowing she's the one.

17:29.634 --> 17:31.636
How's Paige?

17:31.740 --> 17:35.261
Ah, she's still looking
for a job.

17:35.364 --> 17:37.021
It's been tough.

17:37.125 --> 17:40.611
Sorry, mate.

17:40.714 --> 17:42.233
I'll leave you to it.

17:42.337 --> 17:43.924
Yeah.

17:53.727 --> 17:55.833
Hey, Skip.

17:55.936 --> 17:57.214
You all good, mate?

17:57.317 --> 17:58.560
Yeah, yeah.

17:58.663 --> 18:00.424
You've been a big quiet
lately.

18:00.527 --> 18:02.805
I just got a lot on.

18:02.909 --> 18:04.635
You haven't been yourself
at training.

18:04.738 --> 18:06.050
Yeah, you know?

18:06.154 --> 18:09.088
Your form
hasn't been great.

18:09.191 --> 18:12.021
If this engagement stuff is
taking your mind off the game --

18:12.125 --> 18:13.713
It's not.

18:13.816 --> 18:15.059
Well, give us a yell
if it does.

18:15.163 --> 18:16.681
I'll get Kath to have
a cheeky word with Tahlia

18:16.785 --> 18:18.131
and get you out.

18:18.235 --> 18:20.271
Alright, get into it.

18:28.452 --> 18:31.524
Look what arrived.

18:31.627 --> 18:35.044
Oh!

18:35.148 --> 18:36.391
How'd it all go
with Brody?

18:36.494 --> 18:37.599
There might be
something.

18:37.702 --> 18:38.979
Don't --
don't get excited.

18:39.083 --> 18:41.223
We still have to get Jim
over the line first.

18:41.327 --> 18:42.673
Containing excitement.

18:42.776 --> 18:44.916
The thing is Brody doesn't
really do confrontation,

18:45.020 --> 18:47.160
so afterwards we met up
with one of my followers.

18:47.264 --> 18:49.058
Weirdly direct.

18:49.162 --> 18:50.336
A follower?

18:50.439 --> 18:51.544
Oh, it's not like that.

18:51.647 --> 18:52.890
I thought
she was trolling me.

18:52.993 --> 18:54.857
You met with a troll?Oh, anti-climax.

18:54.961 --> 18:56.514
Okay,
she wasn't even a troll.

18:56.618 --> 18:58.896
But -- but, Paige,
she could have been a reporter.

18:58.999 --> 19:01.381
Um, relax.

19:01.485 --> 19:02.900
She doesn't even know
who you are.

19:03.003 --> 19:04.488
Paige,
she would have no idea

19:04.591 --> 19:07.146
who you were
if you weren't my girlfriend.

19:08.837 --> 19:10.632
I'm sorry.

19:10.735 --> 19:14.739
Look, social media,
it's still media.

19:14.843 --> 19:17.121
If anything comes out about me,
the club might --

19:17.225 --> 19:19.158
You know, there is a world
outside of football, right?

19:19.261 --> 19:20.780
I mean, maybe,

19:20.883 --> 19:23.369
just this once,
this isn't about you

19:23.472 --> 19:26.268
or the 20-plus guys
I come runner-up to every week.

19:26.372 --> 19:27.683
Okay, look, you've really got
to get over that.

19:27.787 --> 19:28.960
It is my job.
That's right!

19:29.064 --> 19:30.755
It's a job!
It's just a job.

19:30.859 --> 19:32.136
It's more than just a job!

19:32.240 --> 19:33.551
It's my career!

19:33.655 --> 19:34.897
You'd get that
if you had one!

19:35.001 --> 19:36.520
I did in Casterton,

19:36.623 --> 19:38.763
and I gave it up
for a couple of reasons,

19:38.867 --> 19:40.731
one of them being you!Yeah, well...

19:40.834 --> 19:42.802
maybe that was a mistake.

19:42.905 --> 19:44.390
That's how you're
breaking up with me?

19:44.493 --> 19:46.461
No!

19:46.564 --> 19:49.429
I-I don't know.

19:49.533 --> 19:52.018
I don't think so.

19:52.121 --> 19:53.985
You don't thinkso?

19:54.089 --> 19:57.506
Well, just back home,
this was just so much easier.

19:57.610 --> 19:58.645
With all this shit, I --

19:58.749 --> 20:00.751
Are you serious?

20:22.566 --> 20:24.430
The girls think we should
get ahead of the story.

20:24.533 --> 20:25.741
Tell the truth.
That way --

20:25.845 --> 20:27.156
Hold on.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.055
You told the girls
about me?

20:29.158 --> 20:32.127
Yeah. Well, with this
and the engagement party...

20:32.231 --> 20:33.473
Yeah.
No, I get it.

20:33.577 --> 20:34.785
It's just I thought that
was something we would

20:34.888 --> 20:37.374
decide together.

20:37.477 --> 20:40.169
I know, but we're kind of
pressed for time here.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.585
So...

20:41.688 --> 20:43.828
So, um, what can we do
about these?

20:43.932 --> 20:45.899
Can we pay them out
or something?

20:46.003 --> 20:47.625
There's no guarantee they're not
going to sell the photos

20:47.729 --> 20:48.971
to someone else.

20:49.075 --> 20:51.905
I have a daughter, Jess.

20:52.009 --> 20:53.321
This is fast.

20:53.424 --> 20:55.115
We have to tell the truth
eventually.

20:55.219 --> 20:57.601
Otherwise, people are going
to assume it's Jack's baby.

21:01.121 --> 21:02.226
Are you serious?

21:02.330 --> 21:03.296
No!
No, no, no.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.160
Don't.

21:10.648 --> 21:13.306
Okay, um...

21:13.410 --> 21:16.827
we should probably
take some time.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.380
You should speak
to your ex-wife,

21:18.484 --> 21:20.865
discuss how this might
affect your daughter.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.183
I'll see you tomorrow.
Okay.

21:37.192 --> 21:39.815
Tahlia: Come on, Connor,
you better get moving.

21:39.919 --> 21:41.955
Come on,
we're going to be late.

21:44.268 --> 21:46.028
Oh, babe, babe,
I laid out your blue suit.

21:46.132 --> 21:47.616
Yeah, I'm wearing
the black one.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.584
Why would you wear the black one
when I like the blue one?

21:49.687 --> 21:51.379
Why would you lay out
my clothes at all?

21:51.482 --> 21:53.829
I'm not a child.But I love you
in the blue one.

21:53.933 --> 21:55.279
It looks great in photos.

21:55.383 --> 21:56.832
Well, you're going to have
to learn to love me

21:56.936 --> 21:59.179
in the black one.

22:04.771 --> 22:06.255
Paige,
come on, get ready.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.671
We're going to be late.

22:07.774 --> 22:09.328
I'm not going.

22:09.431 --> 22:10.605
What?

22:10.708 --> 22:14.505
Why?

22:14.609 --> 22:16.749
Look, Paige,
today isn't about us.

22:16.852 --> 22:18.129
It's about
Connor and Tahlia.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.339
I really don't want to
ruin their day

22:20.442 --> 22:22.720
by rocking up alone
and drawing attention.

22:22.824 --> 22:25.482
Is that the only reason,
you don't want to go alone?

22:25.585 --> 22:28.277
What?
No, no, I get it.

22:28.381 --> 22:29.831
You're a professional
footy player now.

22:29.934 --> 22:32.074
You can't go to a party
without your plus-one.

22:35.043 --> 22:37.425
Babe,
I'm worried about Jessie.

22:37.528 --> 22:38.633
I can't get a hold of her.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.048
I don't blame her.

22:40.151 --> 22:41.360
If I was having a baby
with another bloke,

22:41.463 --> 22:42.740
I'd go underground, too.

22:42.844 --> 22:45.122
You're being judgy, are you?Not at all.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.365
These ones?Yeah.

22:46.468 --> 22:47.780
Could you hurry up?

22:47.883 --> 22:49.747
Today is not the day
to be late for Tahlia.

22:49.851 --> 22:52.819
Part of me is intrigued to see
what would happen if we were.

22:52.923 --> 22:55.684
Nothing good,
I can assure you.

22:58.135 --> 23:01.552
Well, nothing is set up.

23:01.656 --> 23:03.036
Why are you so calm?

23:03.140 --> 23:04.486
Can you just
give us a minute?

23:04.590 --> 23:08.179
Thanks.

23:08.283 --> 23:10.043
I want to ask you
a question.

23:10.147 --> 23:13.150
Now?

23:13.253 --> 23:15.946
Do you want
a mirrored dance floor?

23:16.049 --> 23:17.119
Is that a trick question?

23:17.223 --> 23:18.327
No. Do you want one?

23:18.431 --> 23:19.777
No, I really don't.

23:19.881 --> 23:21.986
Then fuck it.

23:22.090 --> 23:24.092
In 50 years, I am not going
to look back and think,

23:24.195 --> 23:26.991
"Oh, those roses
were perfect."

23:27.095 --> 23:30.339
I'm going to look back,
and I'm going to think of you.

23:30.443 --> 23:34.102
We don't need some stupid,
multi-tiered, floral candelabra.

23:34.205 --> 23:37.070
I won't even wear
the big dress.

23:37.174 --> 23:40.419
I love you.

23:40.522 --> 23:43.801
Connor,
let's get married today.

23:45.941 --> 23:47.667
No.

23:47.771 --> 23:49.151
What?

23:49.255 --> 23:52.741
Why?

23:52.845 --> 23:56.331
I just haven't felt right
since Jack.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.610
And there's so much pressure
from the club.

23:59.714 --> 24:00.991
Oh, babe...

24:02.889 --> 24:04.891
I slept with Kath.

24:07.687 --> 24:10.621
What?

24:10.725 --> 24:13.106
About a month ago.

24:16.144 --> 24:18.526
I'm so sorry.

24:18.629 --> 24:20.873
How many times?

24:20.976 --> 24:23.151
Once, just once.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.432
Twice.

24:32.643 --> 24:36.267
I-I know
I am an idiot.

24:36.371 --> 24:38.546
I understand if you want to
call the whole thing off.

24:41.272 --> 24:43.412
Is that what you want?

24:43.516 --> 24:47.002
I don't know
what I'm doing, Tahls.

24:47.106 --> 24:49.073
Tell me what to do.

24:54.216 --> 24:56.356
You're gonna
pull yourself together.

24:56.460 --> 25:00.913
And walk out there
and marry me.

25:01.016 --> 25:02.708
Today.

25:09.335 --> 25:12.683
Hello.
Hey, yourself.

25:12.787 --> 25:14.754
We got 15 minutes.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.451
Oh, shit.
Are you serious?

25:22.555 --> 25:24.315
The babysitter,
she's here early.

25:24.419 --> 25:26.317
Um, can you
show Carvey in?

25:26.421 --> 25:27.664
Introduce her to the kids
and show her around?

25:27.767 --> 25:29.113
What?
Can't you?

25:29.217 --> 25:31.184
No, Trav.

25:31.288 --> 25:32.703
I've only got
half my face on.

25:32.807 --> 25:35.292
Thank you.
Alright.

25:35.395 --> 25:36.500
Carvey!
Hey, how are you?

25:36.604 --> 25:38.985
Good, thanks.Good! Come on in.

25:39.089 --> 25:40.435
Alright.

25:40.539 --> 25:43.818
Uh, front door, playroom,
Mitchell -- menace.

25:43.921 --> 25:45.785
Abby,
uh, depends on the day.

25:45.889 --> 25:46.855
Kids,
say hi to Carvey.

25:46.959 --> 25:47.856
-Hi.
-Hey.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.032
Good.
Study, hallway.

25:51.135 --> 25:54.069
Uh, bedroom, bathroom.

25:54.173 --> 25:56.831
Laundry.
Oh, kids' bedrooms, boom, boom.

25:56.934 --> 25:58.729
We have lounge room.

25:59.868 --> 26:01.870
Kitchen.
Dinner's in the fridge.

26:01.974 --> 26:04.286
Microwave for six minutes,
no more, no less.

26:04.390 --> 26:05.943
Got it down
to a fine art.

26:06.047 --> 26:07.462
Dinner at 6:30.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.844
Half an hour of TV,
nothing weird.

26:09.947 --> 26:10.914
Bed at 7:30.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.640
Mitchell
will put up a fight.

26:12.743 --> 26:15.712
If he does, just give him
a little bit of a smack.

26:15.815 --> 26:18.404
Ah, I'm joking.
Don't.

26:18.507 --> 26:21.269
I'll call
Child Services.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.857
Ooh, number's
on the fridge.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.203
We'll be home by 11:00.

26:24.306 --> 26:27.655
Thank you,
and have a good night.

26:36.560 --> 26:37.975
Oh.

26:38.079 --> 26:39.770
I was in the next room!

26:39.874 --> 26:42.704
If I'm in the general vicinity,
I expect, at the very least,

26:42.808 --> 26:44.948
an invitation
to any downtown activity.

26:45.051 --> 26:47.260
There's no time, Trav.
It's quicker without you.

26:49.884 --> 26:53.128
Excuse me.

27:04.001 --> 27:06.521
Damn it.

27:08.765 --> 27:10.629
You can go if you're ready.

27:10.732 --> 27:11.940
He'll be fine.
Thank you.

27:12.044 --> 27:13.079
No, don't!

27:13.183 --> 27:14.529
It's okay, baby.

27:14.633 --> 27:17.083
No! No!

27:19.120 --> 27:20.708
Hi, you've reached Nate Savo.

27:20.811 --> 27:22.364
I'm probably doing something
wildly interesting.

27:22.468 --> 27:23.745
Please leave a message
at the tone.

27:41.452 --> 27:43.454
Hey, are you close?

27:43.558 --> 27:46.147
I got to go back
for an emergency surgery.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.942
I'm so sorry, Jess.

27:48.045 --> 27:49.944
Uh, I got the call
this morning.

27:50.047 --> 27:51.635
I know you must be
disappointed.

27:51.739 --> 27:53.982
I really
wanted to be there.

27:54.086 --> 27:55.915
Did you?

27:56.019 --> 27:57.986
What?

27:58.090 --> 28:00.575
Did you
want to be here?

28:00.679 --> 28:02.266
Yeah, of course.

28:02.370 --> 28:04.648
So you won't mind if I mention
your name to people?

28:04.752 --> 28:06.098
Of course not.

28:06.201 --> 28:09.032
If I tell them
we're having a baby together?

28:16.833 --> 28:20.595
So you didn't really want
to be here, did you, Nate?

28:20.699 --> 28:22.079
Jessie, I'm just --

28:22.183 --> 28:25.980
Not ready?

28:26.083 --> 28:28.085
Not my problem.

28:46.828 --> 28:48.243
Thanks for coming, Mum.

28:48.347 --> 28:50.832
Wouldn't miss my only son's
engagement party.

28:50.936 --> 28:52.351
Tahlia.
Diane.

28:52.454 --> 28:56.182
Oh, I see your blood
diamonds finally arrived.

28:56.286 --> 28:57.701
Right on schedule.

28:57.805 --> 28:59.185
It's less elaborate
than I imagined.

28:59.289 --> 29:00.359
Wouldn't want to be
too predictable.

29:00.462 --> 29:02.913
Heaven forbid.
Mm-hmm.

29:04.639 --> 29:06.952
So how do we do this?

29:07.055 --> 29:11.059
Just smile and nod
and get through it.

29:13.165 --> 29:14.580
-Hey.
-Hello.

29:14.683 --> 29:18.342
Hi!
-Hi!

29:18.446 --> 29:20.966
Did I miss
the flower candelabra?

29:21.069 --> 29:22.415
Mnh-mnh.

29:22.519 --> 29:24.624
You okay?
Yeah.

29:24.728 --> 29:27.351
Champagne?
Yes.

29:27.455 --> 29:29.975
A magnum, actually.
On it.

29:40.399 --> 29:41.780
Congratulations,
you two.

29:41.883 --> 29:43.229
Ah, thank you, Brian.

29:43.333 --> 29:44.679
You look gorgeous
as usual.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.370
Chuffed for you, mate.
-Thanks.

29:46.474 --> 29:48.856
Hello.

29:48.959 --> 29:52.342
You look beautiful!

29:52.445 --> 29:54.862
I will smile
at functions.

29:54.965 --> 29:57.140
I will laugh
when people are watching.

29:57.243 --> 30:00.419
But mark my words,
I will destroy you.

30:00.522 --> 30:02.145
-Tahlia --
-The clock is ticking,

30:02.248 --> 30:05.700
Kath Rickards, and you're about
to blow the fuck up.

Firstly,
thank you all for coming.

32:45.377 --> 32:48.552
Connor and I are thrilled
to have you all here.

32:48.656 --> 32:51.486
So thrilled, in fact, that we've
got a little surprise for you.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.081
Connor and I are
getting married today!

33:04.568 --> 33:07.916
That explains his form.

33:08.020 --> 33:11.782
Okay, if we could all please
clear a path for him.

33:15.648 --> 33:17.443
-Oh, you are kidding me.
-What?

33:17.547 --> 33:19.169
She's going to make him
walk down the aisle.

33:22.276 --> 33:23.863
A little encouragement,
people.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.589
Come on.

33:31.699 --> 33:33.770
What's that?

33:33.873 --> 33:36.083
Of course, she would.

33:36.186 --> 33:38.292
What the --Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:38.395 --> 33:39.845
What?
What do you think
you're doing?

33:39.948 --> 33:43.400
You are not going anywhere
until we are finished.

33:43.504 --> 33:44.988
I'm not even that good mates
with him anyway.

33:45.092 --> 33:46.921
No.

34:16.502 --> 34:17.676
Officiant: Are we ready?

34:17.779 --> 34:20.403
Yes!
Yes!

34:22.612 --> 34:25.718
We've both had doubts
about this relationship.

34:25.822 --> 34:29.412
And we've both done some pretty
shitty things to each other.

34:29.515 --> 34:32.242
But for better or worse,

34:32.346 --> 34:35.763
I want to make this
work with you...

34:35.866 --> 34:38.041
because I love you.

34:40.768 --> 34:45.221
And I understand you better
than anyone else.

34:45.324 --> 34:48.914
I know I've let you down.

34:49.017 --> 34:52.780
Tried to push you away.

34:52.883 --> 34:57.681
No matter what I've done,
you never left me.

34:57.785 --> 35:00.788
I haven't.

35:00.891 --> 35:04.895
Some powerful
and unusual vows.

35:04.999 --> 35:09.072
It's my pleasure to pronounce
you husband and wife.

35:09.176 --> 35:12.938
Tahlia, you may now
kiss your beautiful groom.

-Let the music play.

35:20.290 --> 35:21.498
Yeah!

35:21.602 --> 35:23.328
Yeah, yeah!

35:23.431 --> 35:25.330
Weddings, hey?!

35:25.433 --> 35:28.126
Yes! Yes!

35:28.229 --> 35:29.748
Congratulations, mate.

35:29.851 --> 35:31.163
Ripper of a wedding.

35:31.267 --> 35:32.475
I loved the vows.

35:32.578 --> 35:33.993
-Yeah.
-They really hit home for me.

35:34.097 --> 35:36.410
Really? I was worried it might
have sounded unrehearsed.

35:36.513 --> 35:39.309
No, no, no, no,
it was poetic.

35:39.413 --> 35:42.243
You, two.

35:42.347 --> 35:43.969
No wonder you've been
all over the place,

35:44.072 --> 35:45.971
trying to keep
that secret under wraps.

35:46.074 --> 35:47.490
Yeah, a bit of a surprise
for me, too.

35:47.593 --> 35:48.801
Were you involved in this?

35:48.905 --> 35:50.562
In more ways
than you can imagine.

35:50.665 --> 35:53.254
In fact, Kath's already given
Connor our wedding present.

35:53.358 --> 35:55.083
That's my Kath.

35:55.187 --> 35:57.948
Always one step ahead
of the game.

35:58.052 --> 35:59.571
-Uh, beer?
-No, no, no, hang on, hang on.

35:59.674 --> 36:01.159
I want to get a photo.

36:01.262 --> 36:03.299
I want to remember this moment
for the rest of my life.

Yeah.

36:17.036 --> 36:19.246
Just hear me out.

36:19.349 --> 36:20.902
It was a mistake.

36:21.006 --> 36:23.629
A mistake that every day
I wish I could take back.

36:25.976 --> 36:29.428
You mean more to me
than you know, Tahlia.

36:29.532 --> 36:31.534
I know saying I'm sorry is
just not going to cut it,

36:31.637 --> 36:34.157
so just tell me what I can do
to make this better.

36:34.261 --> 36:36.021
I'll do it.

36:38.541 --> 36:40.922

Another one?

Oh, mate,
what are you thinking?

37:27.590 --> 37:29.937
Mate...

37:30.040 --> 37:32.215
What about Maddy Cochrane?

37:32.319 --> 37:33.527
And don't let that
smile fool you.

37:33.630 --> 37:35.183

you mind if I cut in?

-Oh!
-Yeah.

37:42.121 --> 37:43.330
No, no, no,
I mean with you, mate.

37:43.433 --> 37:45.090
Oh.

Alright.

37:46.298 --> 37:48.473

You ready?

I thought all of this would be
a lot simpler, but...

38:20.228 --> 38:22.955
You're living
your dream, Dan.

38:23.059 --> 38:25.268
Yeah, but my head's been
so far up my ass, I know --

38:25.372 --> 38:29.168
I think what you're doing
is extraordinary.

38:29.272 --> 38:33.863
And yeah, there's -- there's
bound to be collateral damage.

38:33.966 --> 38:35.554
It's naive to think
there won't be.

38:35.658 --> 38:37.073
Yeah, but I asked you
to come here.

38:37.176 --> 38:39.662
I chose to come here...

38:39.765 --> 38:42.665
because I love you.

38:42.768 --> 38:44.667
And I believe in you.

38:44.770 --> 38:46.600
And I want
incredible things for you.

38:46.703 --> 38:48.291
For us.

38:48.395 --> 38:49.982
For us.

38:53.227 --> 38:56.817
I don't want to
lose you, Paige.

38:56.920 --> 38:57.956
I don't want to
lose us.

38:58.059 --> 39:00.027
Neither do I.

39:05.653 --> 39:07.655
He's world class,
mate.

39:07.759 --> 39:10.969
His form in the '02 Grand Final
was impeccable.

39:11.072 --> 39:12.280
You're dreaming,
mate.

39:12.384 --> 39:15.836
No bloody way!

39:15.939 --> 39:17.493
How we tracking?

39:17.596 --> 39:19.287
Pretty good.

39:19.391 --> 39:20.530
Get him another drink,
Kath.

39:20.634 --> 39:22.256
Let his hair down
a little bit.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.570
Alright, 10 minutes.
Then I'm getting a cab.

39:29.470 --> 39:30.851
Oh, no.

39:38.272 --> 39:41.275
Can I have a whiskey,
neat, please?

39:43.242 --> 39:44.451
Hey.

39:44.554 --> 39:45.797
I was just going
to have one more.

39:45.900 --> 39:47.695
Our little secret.

39:47.799 --> 39:49.248
Just whatever
you got on tap.

39:49.352 --> 39:50.733
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

39:50.836 --> 39:53.494
I've been meaning to
thank you.

39:53.598 --> 39:55.634
For looking out
for Jessie.

39:55.738 --> 39:57.291
It really means a lot.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.880
Yeah.
Well, she means a lot.

39:59.983 --> 40:01.571
She looks
beautiful tonight.

40:01.675 --> 40:04.988
Yeah.

40:05.092 --> 40:07.784
Rusty,
I want you to know

40:07.888 --> 40:09.717
that we're tight-lipped,
okay?

40:09.821 --> 40:11.926
The Vault,
the girls call it.

40:12.030 --> 40:14.135
And now that I know everything,
I can help.

40:14.239 --> 40:16.206
I just wish
I'd known sooner.

40:16.310 --> 40:18.519
I might have been able to
prevent a lot of heartache.

40:21.833 --> 40:24.801
You know I'm sorry.

40:24.905 --> 40:26.251
And I would have come to you
a lot earlier,

40:26.354 --> 40:28.736
but I knew Brian
hadn't told you yet.

40:33.016 --> 40:34.880
Things got out of hand.

40:34.984 --> 40:36.882
You were acting like you were
the only one in this.

40:36.986 --> 40:38.746
You have no idea what this
has been like for me!

40:38.850 --> 40:40.645
You blew up my world
without a word!

40:40.748 --> 40:42.578
You crawled back
to your bullshit marriage,

40:42.681 --> 40:44.683
and you left me
with nothing!

40:48.169 --> 40:50.033
That was the last thing
that I said to him.

40:50.137 --> 40:52.173
Help! Help!

40:54.624 --> 40:56.730
Jack!
Jack!

40:58.386 --> 41:00.837
You and Jack were in love.

41:02.183 --> 41:04.634
I miss him so much.
