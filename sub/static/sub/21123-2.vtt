[Zoe] <i>Okay, brain,</i>
<i>what's with the epic horse dreams?</i>

01:11.160 --> 01:12.200
[Rosie] There they are.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.440
- [Pin] Raven!
- [whip snaps]

01:17.360 --> 01:18.640
Come on. Come on, Raven.

01:18.720 --> 01:19.920
What is he doing?

01:20.880 --> 01:23.240
So, will there be a Ferris wheel
at this pier?

01:23.320 --> 01:26.280
No. If you're lucky,
we might have a go on a 2P slot machine.

01:26.360 --> 01:29.960
Ah, can I... Can I meet you there?
I've just seen someone outside.

01:30.040 --> 01:32.680
Someone I met yesterday.
I wanna make sure they're okay.

01:32.760 --> 01:35.440
A friend? We've only been here a day.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.120
I met him while looking for Rosie.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.640
Wait. "Him"?

01:38.720 --> 01:39.720
Bye.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.440
Did Zoe meet a guy?

01:43.560 --> 01:45.520
[Pin] Steady. Steady.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.240
- [whinnying]
- Come round.

- Come on, boy. Get back. Come on.
- [whip snapping]

- Hey, stop it!
- Get out of the field!

Steady. Steady.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.760
- [yelps]
- [Raven whinnies]

02:01.800 --> 02:03.480
Whoa, whoa, whoa, boy. Whoa, steady.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.240
Steady, boy, steady. Whoa! Whoa!

02:06.320 --> 02:07.640
Whoa, boy, whoa.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.520
Raven, Raven, relax. Relax.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.760
Shh! Wait, wait, wait.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.720
We need to stop meeting like this.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.520
Come here. Come here. You're okay.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.720
That's it. There you go.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.720
How are you doing? Oh, okay.

02:25.240 --> 02:26.440
[hushing]

02:29.400 --> 02:30.400
Look at them.

02:31.720 --> 02:32.880
It's how it was yesterday.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.000
Incredible, isn't it?

02:37.680 --> 02:39.800
- What do you think you're doing?
- Right back at you.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.120
The way you had him on that rope,
he felt trapped.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.600
- He's got to know who's boss.
- I suppose that's you?

02:44.680 --> 02:46.680
No room in a yard
for a horse that can't be ridden.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.440
- [Raven neighs]
- Raven's on borrowed time as it is.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.400
I may not know that much about horses...

02:51.480 --> 02:53.360
That's right. You don't.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.880
[Zoe] <i>He's got a point though.</i>

02:56.960 --> 02:59.320
<i>I don't understand any of it.</i>

02:59.920 --> 03:02.200
<i>On the other hand,
no one talks to me like that.</i>

03:02.280 --> 03:04.800
Hey, moody horse boy. Get back here.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.440
[sighs]

03:10.920 --> 03:12.200
So, what do you think?

03:13.800 --> 03:16.840
I think you and me
have some talking to do. [chuckles]

03:17.360 --> 03:19.560
- Sounds serious.
- Oh, it is.

03:19.640 --> 03:20.480
[cell phone rings]

03:20.560 --> 03:21.560
Oh.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.240
Saved by the bell. [chuckles]

03:23.960 --> 03:25.080
Maybe it's Dad.

03:27.720 --> 03:28.720
Hello?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.920
Hello. How did you get this number?

03:33.720 --> 03:36.200
[stammers] I'll just go somewhere
a little quieter.

03:38.680 --> 03:40.160
How much quiet does she need?

03:40.240 --> 03:41.480
Excuse me.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.160
If a number says it's unknown,
does that mean it's from America?

03:50.920 --> 03:51.920
Who was that?

03:52.080 --> 03:54.360
Oh, just an old friend.

03:54.440 --> 03:56.360
Now, how about that ice cream?

04:03.040 --> 04:04.040
You came back.

04:08.600 --> 04:09.920
Zoe, there's so much to tell you.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.800
- Speculative, made-up gossip, she means.
- It's not made up.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.816
- Horse thieves are real.
- Horse thieves?

04:15.840 --> 04:20.520
Shh! You'll upset Bob.
He's very sensitive.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.600
Bob's your horse?

04:22.200 --> 04:24.760
I share him with my brother, Ben.
Stunning, isn't he?

04:24.840 --> 04:26.760
- [Bob breaks wind]
- [laughs] Bob.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
That wasn't me.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.840
[Sam] Right, gang. Listen up.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.200
So, <i>Pony People Magazine</i> are visiting
the yard today.

04:34.280 --> 04:35.440
Whoo!

04:36.800 --> 04:39.440
- It's <i>Vogue </i>for horses.
- Didn't know horses could read.

04:39.520 --> 04:41.560
[Sam] This is our chance
to let the stables shine,

04:41.640 --> 04:43.360
to spread the word about Bright Fields

04:43.440 --> 04:46.320
and bring lots and lots
of new riders our way.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.520
[clears throat] Well, hopefully, anyway.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.880
Speaking of which, this is Zoe.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.680
She found Raven, so we owe her big time.

04:53.760 --> 04:55.400
Let's make her really welcome.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.120
[all whooping]

04:58.560 --> 05:00.056
If you can't find a chore
that needs doing,

05:00.080 --> 05:02.200
just come and find Marcus or me.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.920
- Marcus is Sam's cousin.
- He's the best rider in the yard.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.120
He's really nice.

05:08.200 --> 05:11.880
And he's talented and handsome,
and I love him.

05:11.960 --> 05:12.960
- [hushes]
- What?

05:13.400 --> 05:14.560
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.920
- [stammers] I gotta go.
- Wait. Where are you going?

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
- I'm supposed to meet up with my mom.
- But you can't leave.

05:23.560 --> 05:24.400
You just got here.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.040
Plus, I can't carry the hay bales
on my own. Come on.

05:29.640 --> 05:30.880
[Mia] Sam, got a minute?

05:30.960 --> 05:34.240
My friend from school was on the cover
of <i>Pony People Magazine.</i>

05:34.320 --> 05:37.480
I think it'd be really good for the yard
if I was on the cover, too.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.600
I think you stand a pretty good chance.
Firefly's so lovely.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.640
Oh, no.
I want to be photographed on Raven.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.440
- Absolutely not.
- Mia's one of the best riders in the yard.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.400
But he's still completely unpredictable.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.080
Well, you've had him for over a year.

05:51.640 --> 05:52.840
If you can't sort him out,

05:52.920 --> 05:55.920
then maybe we should consider
taking our horses elsewhere.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.920
[laughing]

06:00.000 --> 06:02.760
Oh. Don't look so panicked.
You know we all love it here.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.400
I just really want to get on Raven...

06:06.120 --> 06:07.400
by the end of the day.

06:09.840 --> 06:12.080
That magazine cover is in the bag.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.320
Susie...

06:13.400 --> 06:16.480
how many times have I told you not to wear
the same nail polish as me?

06:16.560 --> 06:18.440
Sorry, I'll take it off.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
- Zoe.
- Yeah?

06:20.480 --> 06:21.600
- Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
[Becky groans]

06:23.520 --> 06:24.680
[Pin] You want him tacked up?

06:24.720 --> 06:27.720
Mia's not gonna ride him.
She just wants to sit on him for a photo.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.320
- This is ridiculous.
- [Sam] Yeah, tell me about it.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.920
But if we don't, Mia's dad could pull
his money and we'd be bankrupt.

06:34.080 --> 06:36.320
And putting this tourist
in the arena is gonna help?

06:36.400 --> 06:39.160
- He's a lot calmer when she's about.
- So, quick recap.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.880
You want me to stand in the field
while this guy is yelling at Raven,

06:42.960 --> 06:44.280
making him really angry.

06:45.040 --> 06:46.600
Yep, basically.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.440
Okay. I'm just checking.

06:54.040 --> 06:57.120
[Zoe] So, I know we didn't get off
to a great start,

06:57.360 --> 07:00.920
but seeing as we're gonna be
working together, whatever,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.200
- I was kind of hoping we could...
- [whinnying]

07:03.280 --> 07:04.480
Easy, easy, whoa.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.320
I was kind of hoping we could start over,
you know?

07:07.960 --> 07:08.960
I'm Zoe.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.360
And I just...

07:10.440 --> 07:12.720
Pass me the lunge rope
and try not to get killed.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
Is it this?

07:23.960 --> 07:25.600
[neighing]

07:28.600 --> 07:32.320
Before you start, this is to get him used
to having something on his back.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.200
Heh. Wasn't gonna start.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.040
Easy, easy.

07:36.680 --> 07:38.560
Whoa, whoa, boy. Whoa.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.880
Easy, easy. [hushes]

07:42.560 --> 07:44.120
- [whinnies]
- [Zoe] Whoa.

07:45.040 --> 07:47.880
Whoa. [chuckles]
Looks like we got our work cut out. Huh?

07:50.200 --> 07:51.400
Look, okay.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.720
I don't know
what your problem is with me.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.480
All I know
is that Raven picks up on vibes,

07:56.720 --> 07:58.200
so you and I need to get along,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.480
or he's not gonna be ready
for the photo shoot.

08:00.560 --> 08:02.560
I suggest we start over, okay?

08:03.080 --> 08:05.120
I'm Zoe. How's it going?

08:09.000 --> 08:10.040
Jade!

08:10.640 --> 08:12.880
Another horse has been stolen
from the mainland. Look.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.520
Shouldn't you be getting Bob ready
for the photographer?

08:15.600 --> 08:16.680
Bob was born ready.

08:17.400 --> 08:21.000
But just in case, I've oiled his hooves,
shampooed his mane...

08:21.080 --> 08:22.080
Becky.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.520
And I've also given him
a pre-photo shoot massage.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.400
Just to, you know, get him in the zone.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.000
[Jade] Becky, look!

08:29.600 --> 08:30.600
- Bob!
- Bob!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.720
Bob, come back!

08:34.040 --> 08:35.960
Don't even think about going in the...

08:37.360 --> 08:38.200
muck heap.

08:38.280 --> 08:39.280
[chuckles]

08:40.680 --> 08:42.640
How is he that dirty already?

08:44.600 --> 08:46.920
He's never gonna be
on the magazine cover now.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.080
[Pin] <i>Pass me the saddle pad.</i>

08:53.840 --> 08:54.840
Easy.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.520
- Why is he like this?
- Doesn't trust people.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.200
Huh. Reminds me of someone.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.280
Easy, boy.

09:11.360 --> 09:12.840
Easy, boy. Easy.

09:13.480 --> 09:14.480
[whinnies]

09:17.680 --> 09:18.680
Can I try something?

09:20.960 --> 09:22.200
I got a feeling.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.440
[scoffs]

09:23.520 --> 09:25.080
- A feeling?
- Yeah.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.200
I don't...
I don't think he likes to be tied up.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.240
It's okay. Come on.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.280
Back it up, Raven.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.160
- [Pin] Whoa.
- There we go.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.360
Here, give me the saddle pad.

09:57.240 --> 09:59.920
[hushing] It's okay.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.520
It's okay, it's just me.

10:02.040 --> 10:03.040
It's just me.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.280
[Raven snorts]

10:05.360 --> 10:07.880
- [Pin] Easy, easy, boy.
- Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.320
Good boy.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.200
[laughs]

10:15.320 --> 10:16.320
Give me the saddle.

Please.

It's okay.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
It's okay.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.360
Relax, relax, relax. It's okay.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.320
Good boy.

10:46.920 --> 10:49.520
Good boy. Good boy.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.400
There we go. That wasn't so bad, was it?

- Shoot.

11:26.200 --> 11:27.200
[chuckles]

11:28.480 --> 11:29.520
Uh, it's about Mom.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.600
Did she have a boyfriend on the island?

11:32.720 --> 11:33.720
More than one.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.680
Seemed she was always breaking
someone's heart or other.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.160
Whose heart exactly?

11:39.960 --> 11:40.960
Now you're asking.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.000
There was one boy.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.400
He'd wait for her
at the bottom of the garden.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.120
I kinda need a name. [chuckles]

11:53.480 --> 11:54.480
Nothing.

12:00.760 --> 12:01.800
Nothing.

12:03.520 --> 12:04.520
[sighs]

12:11.520 --> 12:12.520
Bingo.

12:16.160 --> 12:17.480
"Dear Diary."

12:18.480 --> 12:19.480
Mom's old diary!

12:19.800 --> 12:23.200
Totally... shouldn't read it.
This is totally private.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
Totally reading it.

12:26.320 --> 12:28.120
- [whinnying]
- [Pin] Just stand back.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.520
- Sam said I should help.
- You can help by getting out of my way.

12:33.160 --> 12:34.560
Go get me another lead rope.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.080
[Jade] Bob, what is your obsession
with the muck heap?

12:41.480 --> 12:44.040
We'll never get these stains out
before the photographer arrives.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.040
[laughs] Look at them working away.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.920
They think they've got a chance
of being picked.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.080
Which half of Bob are you putting forward
for the magazine cover, Becky?

12:52.160 --> 12:56.280
Don't be mean. It's not her fault she has
to share a scabby pony with her brother.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.320
Daddy says when I'm on the cover,
he'll buy every copy in the newsagents.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.520
He could basically buy the newsagents.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.800
She's so sure she's got this, isn't she?

13:05.960 --> 13:07.160
Raven will look amazing.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.720
Yeah, he will, but, um...

13:10.400 --> 13:13.200
- Bob will look distinctive.
- Yeah, you're right.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.920
There's only one Bob.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.960
[Zoe] Turn it off!
Turn it off! Okay. Turn it off!

13:21.120 --> 13:21.960
Becky.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.080
Oops.

13:24.040 --> 13:25.280
Um...

13:26.920 --> 13:27.840
Come on.

13:27.920 --> 13:29.680
There we go. Lunge rein.

13:30.720 --> 13:31.960
Stirrup leathers.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.080
Bob's old bum sponge.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.480
Ooh. Ooh. Here we are, lead rope.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.960
Hang on, this one's really frayed.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.120
- What is this?
- Nothing.

13:43.200 --> 13:44.800
- That's our Hot Marcus Map.
- Becky!

13:45.400 --> 13:47.920
- What?
- We map out his movements,

13:48.000 --> 13:50.280
so we know where to be
for maximum bump-into ability.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.160
- Marcus!
- What?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.640
Um, I thought you were feeding Monty.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.720
[Marcus] Ah, no. Change of plan.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.600
[Sam] There are three keys.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.480
One for you, one for me,
one for the office.

14:03.080 --> 14:06.120
Thanks. You're sure the sedatives
were stolen, and you just...

14:06.640 --> 14:08.040
I'm not losing my mind, Marcus.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.920
Yesterday, the shelf was full,
now half the packets are gone.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.800
Someone's taken them.

14:17.640 --> 14:19.240
Did you hear that? Horse thieves.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.680
- Shh.
- You know I'm right. You know it.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.920
Thieves use sedatives
to calm the horses they steal.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.280
They mark the horses,
plan their escape route,

14:26.360 --> 14:28.840
and then when everything's in place,
they strike.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.080
That doesn't make sense.
Why would you steal sedatives

14:31.160 --> 14:33.640
- from the stables you're going to rob?
- [Jade] Exactly.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.920
Okay, guys. Well, I gotta go.
Wish me luck.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.760
- [Zoe] Here you go. One lead rope.
- We're out of time.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.920
Really excited
about the magazine cover.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.720
- Just tell Mia he's not ready.
- You really don't know Mia, do you?

14:57.000 --> 14:59.600
"I dream of just running away with E."

15:00.560 --> 15:01.680
No!

15:02.320 --> 15:05.200
"I know it sounds lame,
but what we have is special."

15:06.840 --> 15:09.360
Ew. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.920
"My mom doesn't understand."
Well, that runs in the family.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.160
[sighs]

15:21.400 --> 15:22.760
"M plus E."

15:24.400 --> 15:25.480
Who the heck is E?

15:26.800 --> 15:28.440
It was my dad's place.

15:28.520 --> 15:30.656
It used to be bigger,
but we had to sell one of the fields.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.840
Still, we're busy... Busy enough for now.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.000
He's coming.

15:34.640 --> 15:35.640
Please, Bob, be good.

15:35.680 --> 15:38.320
Focus, Becky. And remember, distinctive.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.160
[man] What an unusual-looking pony.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.040
- His name's Bob.
- Bob. Hello, Bob.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.080
[camera clicking]

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
Where's my horse?

15:56.480 --> 15:57.480
Be careful, Mia.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.560
- It looks like they've brought him...
- Pin.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.640
This is Raven.

16:19.840 --> 16:21.520
[exhales deeply] Beautiful.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.160
- It's okay. It's okay.
- [Raven neighs]

16:23.240 --> 16:24.240
[Zoe] It's okay.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.480
- He is beautiful.
- I know.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.560
Wait. What about distinctive Bob?

16:32.120 --> 16:33.840
- I can take it from here.
- But he's...

16:33.920 --> 16:36.480
Zoe, you're getting in the way
of my picture.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.000
Now, where do you want me?

16:43.800 --> 16:45.840
Where you are is just perfect.

16:46.600 --> 16:49.720
- Lovely, lovely. Big smile. Good.
- [camera clicking]

16:50.320 --> 16:52.280
Stand still, you stupid horse.

16:52.360 --> 16:54.240
- Looking gorgeous, Mia.
- Okay.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.160
- Shh, shh, shh. It's okay.
- Zoe, do you mind?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.400
[Raven snorting]

17:01.440 --> 17:04.160
Marcus, let's try one with me
on the horse.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.440
You sure about this?

17:06.520 --> 17:08.640
- [Mia] Yes.
- Mia, be careful.

17:08.720 --> 17:14.000
[scoffs] Can everyone just calm down?
I'm just trying to mount <i>my </i>horse. Okay?

17:14.480 --> 17:17.200
[Marcus] On three. Ready? One, two, three.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.440
See? No drama.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.360
Hold that position.
The light is fantastic.

17:28.480 --> 17:29.840
Okay. Lovely, beautiful.

17:29.920 --> 17:31.000
Stop pulling him.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.400
Let's try something else.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.000
Uh, bring him round this way.

17:37.400 --> 17:38.680
Calm down, Raven.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.200
Stop it.

17:41.640 --> 17:42.921
- Stop pulling him.
- [Mia] Good?

17:44.120 --> 17:45.880
- This way.
- Lovely. Beautiful.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.760
Okay, look at me. Smile.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
Yeah?

17:49.680 --> 17:52.080
- Like this?
- Good. Bring him round.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.520
Good.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.560
Stop pulling him, stop pulling him,
stop pulling him.

17:57.440 --> 17:59.200
- [Raven whinnying]
- Shut up.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.800
Looking good.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.320
Zoe. Zoe, no!

18:06.400 --> 18:08.080
No, no, no. Okay, okay.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.360
Okay. Okay.

18:11.760 --> 18:14.080
Shh! Raven. Raven, it's okay. Come here.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.480
[shushing] Come here.
Come here. Come here.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.040
Come here. It's okay.

18:22.760 --> 18:24.200
You sure you're okay, Mia?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.680
Of course.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.080
[clears throat]
A little fall never hurt anyone.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.960
Uh, what's her name?
The girl with the wild horse.

18:37.280 --> 18:39.400
Her name is Zoe. And she's our friend.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.240
[Zoe] Let's go, let's go.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.480
Here.

19:09.080 --> 19:10.080
Take this.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.560
You look half frozen.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.200
Thank you.

19:20.320 --> 19:22.360
It was my fault Raven got out yesterday.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.000
I was supposed to fix the gate.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.520
It's... It's fine. It's no big deal.

19:30.600 --> 19:31.760
You could have been hurt.

19:32.360 --> 19:33.360
And...

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
I'm...

19:36.280 --> 19:37.280
I'm sorry.

19:39.480 --> 19:42.560
Pin, if it wasn't for you,
I would have never met Raven.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.720
You'd have met him, one way or another.

19:48.080 --> 19:49.840
Some things are just meant to be.

20:06.440 --> 20:09.520
[Zoe] Don't say anything...
but I know how Raven got out.

20:09.800 --> 20:12.880
- It was horse thieves, wasn't it?
- No. Pin forgot to mend the gate.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.840
Oh. Kind of boring.

20:15.400 --> 20:19.800
We don't know who's stealing sedatives.
It's horse thieves. Or who Ghost Pony is.

20:19.880 --> 20:22.640
- Or why Bob's obsessed with the muck heap.
- And she's off.

20:23.720 --> 20:26.960
[sighs] I guess I'd better head home.
My mom will be worrying.

20:27.040 --> 20:28.880
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- Will she?

20:28.960 --> 20:30.640
- Will I?
- [Jade] Yeah, totally.

20:30.720 --> 20:33.600
You've got the pony bug now,
and there's no cure for that.

21:01.600 --> 21:05.240
- Granddaughter 1 returns.
- That's my girl. Back in time for dinner.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.160
Okay, I've had the most insane day.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.200
I don't know where to start. Uh...

21:10.280 --> 21:12.680
Sam, she asked me to help with Raven,
he's a horse.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.880
And Pin was like, "Back off, tourist."

21:14.960 --> 21:16.560
- And I...
- You've been at the stables?

21:19.240 --> 21:21.760
It sounds like you had fun,
whatever you were doing.

21:21.840 --> 21:24.280
Everybody's actually kind of cool.
Apart from Mia...

21:24.360 --> 21:25.560
I don't want you riding.

21:30.360 --> 21:31.360
What?

21:31.760 --> 21:32.760
Why?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.560
Because I need you keeping an eye
on Rosie.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.680
- She could come with me.
- Rosie at a stable? I don't think so.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.320
Okay. It's fine. She doesn't have
to be with me the whole time.

21:46.400 --> 21:47.760
This isn't up for discussion.

21:48.520 --> 21:51.120
I've got enough to worry about
with Gramps and your dad and...

21:53.800 --> 21:54.800
[Maggie sighs]

21:55.840 --> 21:58.000
Just... promise me.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.400
No riding.

22:06.520 --> 22:08.240
Sure. No riding.

22:09.880 --> 22:12.480
Whatever you need, Mom.
Whatever you need.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.400
[sighs]

22:21.560 --> 22:23.120
Hey. How was the pier?

22:23.200 --> 22:26.880
Okay, I'm not being funny,
but there was literally one shop.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.600
[gasps] Are you serious?

22:28.680 --> 22:30.160
- I know, right?
- Yeah.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.920
There are more shops than that... in jail.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.200
Well, I'm sure
you found a way to have fun.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.280
Did Mom seem weird to you?

22:40.160 --> 22:43.440
Um, not more than usual, but she's fine.

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
Don't worry.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.640
Well... [sighs] I will be in my room,

22:47.880 --> 22:50.520
avoiding risky activities.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.120
So... yeah.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.760
Mom just went off on me and made it clear
she doesn't want me to ride.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.920
<i>- Well, did you talk to her about it?</i>
- Have you met Mom?

23:00.000 --> 23:02.360
[laughs] <i>Good point. Mm-hmm.</i>

23:02.440 --> 23:05.440
[sighs] Anyway... How have you been, Dad?

23:06.120 --> 23:07.480
How's your time-out going?

23:08.520 --> 23:10.280
<i>It's been pretty quiet.</i>

23:10.360 --> 23:12.840
<i>A little too quiet without you guys.</i>

23:13.680 --> 23:17.920
<i>But tell me about that cute little island
you're on. Did Rosie meet the queen yet?</i>

23:18.880 --> 23:20.320
The queen, she is in London.

23:20.720 --> 23:22.520
And it's... It's cool.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.520
I met some new friends.

23:25.080 --> 23:26.080
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

23:27.600 --> 23:29.880
Dad... what is it?

23:29.960 --> 23:31.880
<i>That sweater, Zoe.</i>

23:32.960 --> 23:34.080
<i>Whose sweater is that?</i>

23:36.080 --> 23:38.280
It's my friend's. He lent it to me.

23:38.360 --> 23:39.280
<i>"He"?</i>

23:39.360 --> 23:41.520
<i>Oh, no. No. Are you hanging out with boys?</i>

23:42.200 --> 23:44.800
<i>Zoe, I've had this talk with you before.</i>

23:45.480 --> 23:49.040
<i>All boys are bad. All of them.</i>

23:49.720 --> 23:51.120
Yes, Dad, yes.

23:51.400 --> 23:52.400
Seriously?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.960
I gotta go, okay? I love you.

23:55.040 --> 23:57.200
<i>- I love you, too.</i>
- I love you. Bye, bye-bye.

23:59.000 --> 24:02.040
[Zoe] <i>My dad always says never judge</i>
<i>a book by its cover.</i>

24:02.520 --> 24:03.800
<i>Take Pin, for example.</i>

24:04.000 --> 24:06.600
<i>The guy looks like he swallowed
a bag of lemons...</i>

24:07.560 --> 24:10.600
<i>but underneath it all,
he's surprisingly...</i>

24:16.840 --> 24:20.000
<i>Surprisingly likely to be a horse thief,
after all.</i>

24:22.320 --> 24:23.320
[sighs]

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
Sedatives.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
Pin...

24:32.640 --> 24:33.640
what have you done?
