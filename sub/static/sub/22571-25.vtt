WEBVTT

00:01.469 --> 00:02.703
- I could take you one-on-one.

00:02.736 --> 00:04.605
- I'm a little fat now,
so my fadeaway is more like

00:04.638 --> 00:05.673
just a pump away.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.807
- But I still could do it.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.209
I'm like Larry Bird
at the end of his career

00:08.242 --> 00:09.877
where just, like,
standing, no more jumping.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.013
- I used to could slam,
but I got scared of heights.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.782
- We should play one-on-one
basketball, that'd be funny.

00:14.815 --> 00:16.317
But instead of playing
to the game point,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.519
we just play to see who
pulls the first hamstring.

00:18.552 --> 00:19.687
- Or who catch asthma first.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.988
- Yeah...

00:21.021 --> 00:22.556
- My fat ass will catch
that  so fast.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.125
- We'll call, like,
a 911 emergency

00:24.158 --> 00:25.726
and stand by whoever
passes out first.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.795
- Hey, we--
ain't nobody dead yet,

00:27.828 --> 00:29.397
but you just here just in case.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.636
male announcer: When storage
units are abandoned...

00:35.669 --> 00:38.005
- Take a good look at this one.
- Whoo!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.507
announcer:
The treasures within...

00:39.540 --> 00:41.509
- I just want to know
what the heck this thing is.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.843
announcer:
Are put up for auction.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.178
- Yup!
- Sold it your way!

00:44.212 --> 00:45.879
- Whoo!
- Shazam!

00:45.913 --> 00:47.415
- You shut your face.

00:47.448 --> 00:49.583
- Oh, that's hot!
- Pop goes the weasel.

00:49.617 --> 00:50.751
- We're back, baby!

00:53.754 --> 00:55.989
- There's a certain rhythm
to Huntington Beach.

00:56.023 --> 00:57.625
It's kinda like, you know,

00:57.658 --> 00:59.293
it's like the heartbeat
of Orange County.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.729
- Oh, the main arteries,
I like that.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.264
- You know,
I like that unless we flatline,

01:03.297 --> 01:04.565
then you're gonna have
to bring your CPR skills

01:04.598 --> 01:05.566
back into action.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.402
So, you're giving me permission
to do mouth

01:08.436 --> 01:11.105
- No.

01:11.139 --> 01:13.507
- We're in Huntington Beach.

01:13.541 --> 01:16.210
I get a little nervous that
we so close by the water.

01:16.244 --> 01:19.079
It dangerous,
'cause Kenny can't swim.

01:19.113 --> 01:20.714
I should've
brought my floaties.

01:20.748 --> 01:24.218
One thing Kenny can't do
is hang ten, brah.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.120
I'm going under.

01:26.154 --> 01:27.621
- We're going
to Huntington Beach,

01:27.655 --> 01:30.258
and Huntington Beach
is my old romping grounds.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.825
I'm very well-connected here.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.462
I get a lot of information
on the lockers.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.564
And today,
I might use that

01:36.597 --> 01:39.400
as a little bit of
distraction technique.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.069
If the other buyers
don't know what I know,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.837
then I know they don't know,

01:43.871 --> 01:44.938
you know?

01:44.972 --> 01:46.374
I'm no stupid person.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.442
I've been in this business
for a long time.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.611
If there's anything
I know how to do,

01:50.644 --> 01:52.880
it's create confusion.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.916
- Huntington Beach is cool
and Zen and laid-back,

01:55.949 --> 01:58.252
but I'm not gonna get
wrapped up in all that,

01:58.286 --> 02:00.120
because the beachy
kind of stuff,

02:00.154 --> 02:01.289
it just doesn't sell for me.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.191
So, I'm looking
for the smalls--

02:03.224 --> 02:04.658
stuff that I can sell
right away,

02:04.692 --> 02:06.894
and let the other guys
deal with the "beach stuff."

02:06.927 --> 02:09.663
- I like you in orange,
you look bright.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.764
Wow.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.700
- Just in case
we fall in the ocean.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.535
- There you go, that is--
- They'll find my black ass.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.569
- Sharks love orange.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.438
- No they don't,
they like black.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.606
- No.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.940
- Then why they eating
all the seals?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.176
- 'Cause they smell fishy.
They don't see color.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.077
- Sharks.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.414
*

02:26.447 --> 02:28.382
- I think I smell
bidding in the air.

02:28.416 --> 02:29.483
It's a great day.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.919
I got a new car,
a pocket full of cash,

02:31.952 --> 02:34.154
and Casey said I could
buy anything I want.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.258
Buy some good lockers today.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.626
- Welcome to Huntington Beach.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.060
We're Dan and Laura Dotson,
American Auctioneers.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.061
Before you go
through these gates,

02:41.094 --> 02:42.296
you need to know the rules.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.597
Gonna give you five minutes
to take a look around.

02:43.631 --> 02:45.966
You can't go inside,
you can't open any boxes,

02:45.999 --> 02:47.201
and who's ever
got the most money

02:47.235 --> 02:48.502
can own it today,
are you ready?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.404
- Let's go!

02:50.438 --> 02:51.405
- Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

02:52.640 --> 02:53.807
- All right, here we go.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.443
Welcome, Huntington Beach.
- Open it up.

02:55.476 --> 02:56.710
Here we go.
- Whoo-hoo!

02:56.744 --> 02:58.412
- Oh, man,
look at the gun safe.

02:58.446 --> 03:00.581
*

03:00.614 --> 03:02.983
- Well, there is a safe,
so you never know.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.117
There could be
something in that,

03:04.151 --> 03:06.153
but that's about it.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.756
,
that bag right here, boy.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.525
And it got that
gun right here, boy.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.894
I smell a little money
right here, boy.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.829
- Maybe money in there.
- That could be.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.832
- Whoo, our future buyer!

03:18.866 --> 03:20.834
- Well, I got from
a really good source

03:20.868 --> 03:22.936
there may be money in there,

03:22.970 --> 03:25.239
but the rest of the stuff
kinda looks low-end.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.240
- Hey!

03:26.274 --> 03:27.308
- Books in there.

03:28.642 --> 03:29.810
What do you think?
You think that's allowed?

03:29.843 --> 03:31.279
- Okay, fine,
I can't bid, I guess.

03:31.312 --> 03:33.514
Did he do this?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.148
- Oh, but don't do it,
you can't do it either.

03:35.182 --> 03:36.350
- You can't do it either,
get out, just get out.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.652
Just get out,
just get out, just get out.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.220
- Well, they bowed out now.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.191
I got a good chance
to get this one.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.192
- All right, here we go...

03:46.394 --> 03:48.596
- Yep...

03:48.629 --> 03:49.763
Yes.
- 50 bucks.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.131
60 bucks 70, 70?

03:51.164 --> 03:52.132
- Right here.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.133
- Kenny's eyes.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.668
- 80, 90.
- Right here.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.237
- Whoo!
- 110, sir, 110.

03:57.271 --> 03:58.272
- 120!
- Yes.

03:58.306 --> 03:59.707
Whoo, that's what
we're talking about.

03:59.740 --> 04:00.974
- Big bucks.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.976
- 130 going once,
130 going twice,

04:03.010 --> 04:04.778
and I've sold it to $120,
can you get it?

04:04.812 --> 04:06.179
- Kenny, do it!

04:06.213 --> 04:07.881
- Kenny didn't get all

04:07.915 --> 04:09.717
touchy-feely
like the other guys.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.619
So, I wons me a locker.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.388
Me and my lucky ass.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.089
Let's see what we got.

04:16.123 --> 04:17.458
Come on, America.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.527
*

04:19.560 --> 04:21.995
We got some change--
about, like,

04:22.029 --> 04:24.465
$5 worth of change here.

04:24.498 --> 04:25.866
What do we got in here?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.669
Raggedy-ass purse.

04:28.702 --> 04:29.937
Nothing.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.339
Empty.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.840
*

04:32.873 --> 04:34.375
What's this?

04:34.408 --> 04:35.909
"Kinky Sex Games"?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.713
Well...

04:39.747 --> 04:42.550
Feel a little kinky.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.051
And a...

04:44.084 --> 04:46.987
Little key handcuffs,
sexual toys.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.656
You know what?

04:48.689 --> 04:50.290
That's a good one.

04:50.324 --> 04:51.859
*

04:51.892 --> 04:54.061
Kenny gonna have
a party tonight!

04:54.094 --> 04:58.098
What goes on in Kenny's bedroom
stays in Kenny's bedroom.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.467
Lord, have mercy.

05:00.868 --> 05:01.835
Sexy.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.237
I gotta find something,
come on.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.407
*

05:06.440 --> 05:08.509
Well, a camera.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.779
Probably worth about 25 bucks
or something right here, boy.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.780
Nice bag, though.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.282
This bag's worth $5.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.283
What we got?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.085
*

05:18.118 --> 05:19.787
"Follow your dreams."

05:19.820 --> 05:21.355
*

05:21.389 --> 05:23.924
What's this say?
Tr

05:23.957 --> 05:25.225
Treetis

05:25.258 --> 05:27.495
Trustus, trestes...

05:27.528 --> 05:29.597
Trest-less.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.965
I'll go back to
follow your dream.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.834
Follow your dreams, America.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.869
I'd say about $10 box.

05:35.903 --> 05:38.238
Well, I can only hope

05:38.271 --> 05:40.307
they got something
in this damn thing.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.775
*

05:43.010 --> 05:44.512
There's something in here!

05:45.879 --> 05:47.581
It's pretty good with the lock.

05:47.615 --> 05:49.383
I wonder how...

05:49.417 --> 05:52.520
it'll fare if
I trip down the stairs.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.388
You think it'll open?

05:55.756 --> 06:00.093
We're about to find out.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.496
- Uh-oh, stairs!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.233
Kumbaya.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.602
*

06:08.636 --> 06:09.837
This is bull.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.405
All that for nothing.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.340
Let me get my ass
back to the auction.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.543
I got to find the lady!

06:15.576 --> 06:17.645
Laura!

06:18.879 --> 06:20.581
- Whoo, oh,
what do we have now?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.683
That's right, there's tubs!

06:23.717 --> 06:24.685
- Oh, no.

06:24.718 --> 06:25.819
Yes. No.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.521
- That is just
a big storage tank.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.289
- I like guys
with storage tanks.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.924
- I can see.
- Yes.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.693
*

06:32.726 --> 06:34.628
- There's a mattress frame
with no mattress.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.929
Poom!

06:35.963 --> 06:37.397
- You know, there's not
a lot of beachy stuff,

06:37.431 --> 06:38.699
so that's perfect.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.267
This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.102
It's clean, it's packed neatly,

06:42.135 --> 06:45.138
and it has potential
treasures and trinkets.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.406
I'm in.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.775
- This is an interesting unit,
I mean,

06:47.808 --> 06:50.177
the stuff looks more low-end,
but it's clean tubs.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.079
Halloween stuff,
which will sell like crazy.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.280
You know, it has potential.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.549
- The bed frame and a toaster.

06:55.583 --> 06:56.584
It looks pretty good.

06:57.885 --> 06:59.820
- Think I'm gonna
go on this one.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.322
- Here we go, number 20,
what's your pleasure?

07:02.355 --> 07:04.024
What are you gonna pay?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.292
- 100 bucks.
- Whoo.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.293
- Yeah.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.897
400.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.998
- Oh, great.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.602
450?

07:14.635 --> 07:16.336
450 going once, I got 425.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.505
450, 450 going twice,.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.973
Last and final call
at 450 bucks...

07:20.007 --> 07:21.141
- Whoo!

07:21.174 --> 07:22.442
- Mary, $425, Mary.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.777
- Sold to the little lady.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.046
All right, folks, come on.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.715
- Ooh, right by my car,
that's kinda fate.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.283
- Damn, Rene, you got that
fancy-ass car on the way, boy.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.519
That your wife's new car?

07:31.552 --> 07:32.886
- That's my car--
well, it's my car right now,

07:32.920 --> 07:34.021
it's probably
my wife's in a week.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.222
- Yeah.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.423
You know how it is
when you're married--

07:36.456 --> 07:37.925
you buy a new car,
and the wife takes it.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.860
- Sorry...

07:39.893 --> 07:41.028
*

07:41.061 --> 07:42.930
- Come on, baby, let's do it.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.131
Here we go!

07:44.164 --> 07:45.899
10 x 20!

07:45.933 --> 07:48.368
*

07:48.401 --> 07:50.003
- There a lot of stuff in here.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.072
Baby stuff, got a rocker,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.207
Rosemary's baby's
bassinet in there.

07:54.241 --> 07:55.643
Whoo.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.010
It is hot in that unit.
- Yeah.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.446
- Looks like there could be
some nice pieces in here,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.649
but it's just
too stacked for me.

08:01.682 --> 08:02.883
I'd have to ve a whole team,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.251
and it's just
teensy little me,

08:04.284 --> 08:05.418
so, nope.

08:05.452 --> 08:06.654
- That's a good-looking unit,
I mean,

08:06.687 --> 08:08.021
there's some antique
furniture in the back,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.389
there's some boxes, I mean,
it's not that much stuff,

08:09.422 --> 08:10.457
but baby clothes.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.060
If it goes cheap, I'll buy it.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.028
- Just a lot of furniture
wrapped up,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.364
and I see some beds
back there and stuff.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.432
Rene, what happened here?

08:19.466 --> 08:20.901
- For reals.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.169
Did you buy that that way?

08:22.202 --> 08:24.004
- No, it's like here
and the other side too.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.573
- Man,
this is the perfect thing

08:25.606 --> 08:26.974
to throw Rene off his game.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.208
Wow.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.710
You literally just
bought this last night?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.078
- Yeah.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.179
freaking.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.914
- This was from another car.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.382
- Yeah, somebody just
hit me here on there.

08:35.415 --> 08:36.684
- Oh, man.
- You're gonna have to

08:36.717 --> 08:38.819
buy yourself out of this
emotional distress.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.754
- He's wound up, man.

08:40.788 --> 08:43.023
Who in the hell buys a car
with four dents in it?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.291
- Yes.
- Rene.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.559
Get your mind off that dent

08:45.593 --> 08:47.595
in your brand-new car
and buy a unit.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.596
All right, here we go.

08:50.664 --> 08:52.099
- 50ucks.
- I got 100 there.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.601
How about 100?
150 where?

08:53.634 --> 08:54.602
150...

08:56.570 --> 08:57.771
I got 200 bucks.
How about 250 and you're up?

08:57.805 --> 08:59.272
- Yes, Darrell's said there.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.275
- 300, 350.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.778
400. 450?

09:04.812 --> 09:06.513
500. 550

09:06.546 --> 09:08.949
600?

09:08.982 --> 09:11.852
700. 750.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.221
800, how about 850?

09:14.254 --> 09:15.255
900

09:15.288 --> 09:16.356
950.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.158
$1,000?

09:18.191 --> 09:20.060
1,100.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.394
1,200.

09:21.428 --> 09:23.897
1,300?

09:23.931 --> 09:25.232
1,300, where

09:25.265 --> 09:27.835
1,250 going once, 1,300?

09:27.868 --> 09:29.002
Are you 1,300?
- He's out.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.671
- What about 1,300 going once,
I got 1,250,

09:30.704 --> 09:32.706
going twice, last and final
call at 1,300 bucks or not.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.074
- Whoo!

09:34.107 --> 09:35.442
- Get it for $1,250.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.177
- Looks like
it is my lucky day.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.412
Rene got all wound up
about his car,

09:39.446 --> 09:40.948
and I wound up with the locker.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.750
- Thank you, folks,
that's the end of the auction.

09:42.783 --> 09:44.384
And don't forget
to pay the lady.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.419
- Damn, bruh,
you didn't get no unit.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.788
But it give you enough time

09:47.821 --> 09:49.556
to drive your fancy car
again, huh?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.124
- Maybe it's a good thing
I didn't buy today,

09:51.158 --> 09:52.993
'cause I need to get back
to the dealership.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.695
- It'll be all right,
I guess, huh?

09:54.728 --> 09:56.129
What are you gonna do?

09:56.163 --> 09:58.231
- Well, wait
for the next auction?

09:59.800 --> 10:02.535
- Okay, I spent 425,

10:02.569 --> 10:06.674
and I'm hoping that these
boxes of mystery are treasures.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.141
*

10:09.409 --> 10:10.543
Come on.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.979
Making money on this locker

10:12.012 --> 10:14.181
better be easier
than opening this door.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.484
Trickery...

10:17.517 --> 10:20.053
Okay, let's start
from the get-go--

10:20.087 --> 10:22.089
hanging clothes.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.858
Ugh, crusty clothes, moving on.

10:24.892 --> 10:27.427
*

10:27.460 --> 10:29.096
Ew, an old toaster.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.397
Oh.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.033
Here's some old nutcrackers.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.868
These are cute,
five bucks a pop.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.104
Oh, here's a jewelry case.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.306
This is pretty nifty
and antique-y,

10:39.339 --> 10:40.708
for sure can sell this.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.710
Huh, there's a
piece of glass missing,

10:42.743 --> 10:44.244
but I can replace that.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.247
Ooh, some
costume jewelry in here,

10:47.280 --> 10:48.716
pretty good.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.283
So, the costume jewelry alone,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.352
I could sell for
probably 25 bucks,

10:52.385 --> 10:56.323
and the jewelry case, 40 bucks.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.991
- Okay.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.226
Hanging clothes--

10:59.259 --> 11:00.460
oh, oh, oh!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.129
I can see a gun!

11:02.162 --> 11:03.864
Scary, oh, my God.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.599
I think it's a real gun.
I'm really scared.

11:06.633 --> 11:08.168
Oh, never mind.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.536
My brother's got these things.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.371
This is airsoft, so...

11:11.404 --> 11:14.307
But I can still get probably
20 bucks in there, not bad.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.609
So far, I'm shooting blanks
in this locker.

11:16.643 --> 11:18.611
Oh, "For Halloween
every year."

11:19.646 --> 11:21.815
Looks like it.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.817
You got a scarecrow.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.719
25 bucks for all this stuff.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.921
More nutcrackers,
these are cute.

11:27.955 --> 11:31.558
Five, six, seven--
seven nutcrackers.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.660
Do ten bucks a pop, 70 bucks.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.363
What's this guy?
Might as well.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.398
Oh, is this a gun or something?
I'm scared.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.170
No, it's a damn shovel.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.372
*

11:45.405 --> 11:48.041
Oh, is this a big spoon
or something? Oh.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.578
This is, like,
to stir some monster stew.

11:51.611 --> 11:52.579
I mean, this really--

11:52.612 --> 11:54.381
thing is about as tall as me.

11:54.414 --> 11:55.983
It's hilarious...

11:56.016 --> 11:57.184
We're gonna put this aside.

11:57.217 --> 11:58.651
I don't know if this
goes with anything,

11:58.685 --> 12:01.388
but if not, this could be
a cute little wall décor

12:01.421 --> 12:02.522
for your kitchen, maybe.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.724
Okay.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.026
Ooh...

12:06.059 --> 12:07.227
Now we're talking!

12:07.260 --> 12:09.362
Ooh.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.098
Something for food, maybe.

12:11.131 --> 12:13.566
Mashes up something--
maybe, like,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.668
for spaghetti or something,
I don't know.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.170
Oof.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.671
Thing's way heavy.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.974
Ooh, this is nice.
Is this copper?

12:21.008 --> 12:22.209
Wow.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.744
Now if we're talking
here a copper pot--

12:24.778 --> 12:26.213
copper's expensive,

12:26.246 --> 12:28.882
and this thing
is freaking heavy-duty.

12:30.383 --> 12:32.485
So, that's fantastic.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.824
Jeez, this ain't no joke.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.459
And this part goes right--
somewhere.

12:39.492 --> 12:41.128
Oh yeah, here we go.

12:41.161 --> 12:42.762
So, this is either
for spaghetti,

12:42.796 --> 12:44.097
coffee, I don't know,

12:44.131 --> 12:46.333
but it's well-made
and it's old-school,

12:46.366 --> 12:49.202
and it's definitely worth
getting checked out, so...

12:49.236 --> 12:52.039
All this stuff
is a bunch of crap!

12:52.072 --> 12:53.140
Freaking...

12:54.174 --> 12:55.742
Dang it.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.910
Ugh.

12:59.246 --> 13:03.383
- Let's see what's going on.
I was excited to get this one.

13:03.416 --> 13:04.651
I beat out Rene

13:04.684 --> 13:07.787
and spent almost 1,300 bucks
on this locker.

13:07.821 --> 13:08.956
Better be worth it.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.258
Brand new sewing machine
still in the box.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.626
$75 bill right there.

13:13.660 --> 13:16.629
Old antique,
hand-carved mirror.

13:16.663 --> 13:18.498
Bottom of that thing
is solid wood.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.367
I'll get 75 bucks
for that old mirror.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.534
No problem.

13:21.568 --> 13:22.903
All right,
let's see what this is.

13:22.936 --> 13:26.539
Ooh, looks like we got a...

13:26.573 --> 13:29.409
Some type of jewelry box
or something here going on.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.743
*

13:30.777 --> 13:32.379
Oh, yeah, look at these.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.014
This is Russian crystal,
actually.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.849
These say Fabergé.

13:35.883 --> 13:38.685
These are probably worth
100 bucks a piece right there.

13:38.718 --> 13:40.187
Nice find.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.288
*

13:41.321 --> 13:43.556
Lalique!

13:43.590 --> 13:45.425
Are you kidding me?

13:45.458 --> 13:47.494
Oh, let this be in here.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.962
Lalique is from Paris.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.398
It's a really high-end crystal.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.433
I haven't gotten Lalique
in years.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.502
Yes!

13:55.535 --> 13:57.370
Art Nouveau Lalique vase.

13:57.404 --> 14:00.740
We're talking probably,
just for this glass vase,

14:00.773 --> 14:02.475
1,200 bucks.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.478
Look at this.
Just all--oh, another Lalique.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.248
Oh, yeah, look at that.

14:08.281 --> 14:09.849
500.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.051
Another Lalique.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.319
Oh, man.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.820
Princess baby vase.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.355
1,200 bucks right here.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.624
Just what's left
in this box alone,

14:17.657 --> 14:20.693
all this Neiman Marcus,
all the antique everything,

14:20.727 --> 14:23.030
there's probably
another 1,000 bucks.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.965
*

14:24.998 --> 14:27.000
Oh, what is--oh-ho-ho.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.401
Y

14:28.435 --> 14:31.604
Fricking antique guitar pedals

14:31.638 --> 14:33.606
and processors
and all that stuff.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.009
Some of these
little electronics stuff

14:36.043 --> 14:38.645
to these guitars
are worth a fortune,

14:38.678 --> 14:41.381
and I know just the guy
to take this stuff to.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.850
This bitching
old Spanish book shelf,

14:43.883 --> 14:45.785
I'll get about 200 bucks
on that.

14:45.818 --> 14:47.687
This is a sleigh bed
right here.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.489
That's probably 200 bucks.

14:49.522 --> 14:53.126
I got this really neat
Spanish wood bar.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.395
That could be a couple hundred
bucks by itself,

14:55.428 --> 14:57.464
but I've got
a beautiful antique,

14:57.497 --> 14:59.466
black velvet fainting couch.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.135
That thing's probably worth
about 500 bucks.

15:02.169 --> 15:03.703
And then we've got this nice,

15:03.736 --> 15:06.906
really quality,
red velvet parlor couch.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.176
That's a $500 bill
all day long.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.278
You just can't go buy
a couch like that.

15:11.311 --> 15:12.879
You know what,
I'll guarantee you

15:12.912 --> 15:15.382
there's another $3,000
in stuff in here.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.383
No problem.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.951
This is one of my best lockers

15:17.985 --> 15:20.620
in a really long time.
Thanks, Rene.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.390
And I still gotta go get all
this music stuff checked out.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.395
Hey!

15:28.428 --> 15:29.729
- Hi.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.199
- Here's the spoon I found.
- Oh, my God.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.801
- I'm having my kitchen gear
looked at by Madeline Barber,

15:34.834 --> 15:39.006
GM of Prince of Venice
food truck.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.207
So, I mean, I'm always looking
for a prince

15:40.240 --> 15:41.841
- So, I mean, I'm always
looking for a prince.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.576
Is there a prince
in there maybe for sale?

15:43.610 --> 15:45.345
- He's not.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.647
Though it is owned
by a literal prince.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.881
Hence the name,
like, Prince of Venice.

15:48.915 --> 15:49.949
- Wow.
- Yeah, his grandfather was

15:49.983 --> 15:51.384
the last king of Italy.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.286
- Yep, but he's married anyway.
- Okay.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.554
Oh.
- So you're out of luck.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.124
- Guess I won't be
Princess Mary of Venice.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.159
Dang it.
- So this is pretty cool.

15:59.192 --> 16:02.462
Lots of really vintage,
old school geeky pasta stuff.

16:02.495 --> 16:03.730
- Yeah.
- So you have, like,

16:03.763 --> 16:05.198
this massive copper pot,

16:05.232 --> 16:07.534
which probably could stand
to be cleaned.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.336
It looks like the Statue
of Liberty in here.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.204
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's also super old.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.805
You can tell by the patina
in here.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.742
Probably the early 1900s.
- Oh, wow.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.677
- Yeah.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.846
- You'd have to take care of it
and, like, clean it out,

16:19.879 --> 16:21.014
but absolutely.
- But still--

16:21.048 --> 16:22.915
- And then this
is actually your pasta roller.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.818
So you would feed your dough
in through here,

16:25.852 --> 16:28.021
you turn it over, and then
it comes out the other side.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.489
- Okay.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.590
- No.
- There's actually

16:30.623 --> 16:32.259
a little stamp on here...
- Oh, wow.

16:32.292 --> 16:35.895
- That says February 13, 1906.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.598
So that's really old
and really cool.

16:38.631 --> 16:42.035
And then these guys right here
are attachments

16:42.069 --> 16:43.870
for different widths of pasta.
- Oh, okay.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.672
- So this one is spaghetti.

16:45.705 --> 16:48.341
This one's more, like,
the fettuccini kind of width,

16:48.375 --> 16:49.609
and this one's somewhere
in between.

16:49.642 --> 16:53.246
So this guy is a flour grinder.
- Oh, okay.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.283
- So you put all of your grain
in here in the little thing,

16:56.316 --> 16:59.286
you open this up right here...
- Oh.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.321
- And then that's
what determines

17:01.354 --> 17:02.755
how fine a grain it is.
- Little grains.

17:02.789 --> 17:05.125
- And that's a spoon.
- For huge masses of people.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.826
- Yeah, or beating people up

17:06.859 --> 17:08.595
that try to eat your pasta.
- Yes.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.796
- And then you don't
want them to.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.199
- So how much do you think
this stuff is worth?

17:12.232 --> 17:14.634
- Altogether, like, gigantic
weapon spoon and all...

17:14.667 --> 17:16.903
- Spoon, yes.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.939
- I'd say you could
easily get...

17:19.972 --> 17:21.474
450.
- Nice.

17:21.508 --> 17:22.475
Okay, cool.
- Yeah.

17:22.509 --> 17:23.943
This is
a really cool collection.

17:23.976 --> 17:27.046
- Looks like I used my noodle
when I bought this locker.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.315
You don't need any help?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.349
- I'm good.
Nope, I'm good.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.351
both: Thank you.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.287
*

17:34.321 --> 17:35.955
- Joe!

17:37.190 --> 17:38.891
- Joe Bonamassa's
the real deal.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.794
He opened for B.B. King
when he was 12 years old,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.930
and he's had 11
number-one albums

17:43.963 --> 17:45.298
on the Billboard Blues chart.

17:45.332 --> 17:49.202
I know he's the guy to tell me
about all of this stuff.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.603
All right,
well, here it is, Joe.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.838
- Nice.
Good stuff.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.106
- Yeah. Hey, listen--
- Have a seat.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.407
Let's talk about your pedals.
- Let's do it.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.309
- This, it's a stage tuner.
Keeps you in tune.

17:56.343 --> 17:57.410
- Mm-kay.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.012
- The MXR line driver,
noise gate.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.549
Basically, this is used
if you have a noisy amp

18:02.582 --> 18:05.152
or anything that's
giving you noise issues.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.454
It makes your sound guy
like you a little bit more

18:07.487 --> 18:09.322
or make your producer not yell.

18:09.356 --> 18:11.191
Is that old?

18:11.224 --> 18:13.693
- Yeah, I would say this is
probably from about 1980.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.129
- That scares me
that you think that's old.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.131
- This one's actually worth
a fair amount.

18:18.165 --> 18:19.666
This Boss OD-1.

18:19.699 --> 18:22.135
It's probably from
the same era, early '80s.

18:22.169 --> 18:24.371
Trick with these, you want 'em
to say "Made in Japan."

18:24.404 --> 18:26.539
That's their golden era.
- Okay.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.175
- The newer ones would say
"Made in Taiwan."

18:28.208 --> 18:29.942
- Made in Japan.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.912
I would say it's good enough
to stomp on.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.448
Remember, these things,
by design, are kicked.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.585
On a one-to-ten scale,
this is a solid seven or eight,

18:38.618 --> 18:40.320
so they're pretty good,
you know?

18:40.353 --> 18:42.922
This TC device is really nice.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.957
- I couldn't even begin
to tell you what that thing is.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.559
- What it is
is it's an echo unit.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.361
So it makes you sound like
you're in a...

18:48.395 --> 18:49.662
- Oh.
Hey.

18:49.696 --> 18:50.763
- Yeah, exactly.

18:50.797 --> 18:54.234
They use these
mostly in studios.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.903
Guitar players discovered these
in the mid-'80s,

18:56.936 --> 18:59.772
and guitar players like
the Edge from U2 would use 'em.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.275
It was very advanced
for its time.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.378
Now, you know, you have
more options on your iPhone

19:05.412 --> 19:06.913
than you do with this...
Yeah.

19:06.946 --> 19:10.250
- But back when this came out,
it was really far-reaching.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.852
- The main question is,
what are they worth?

19:12.885 --> 19:15.622
- This, you wanna give
to a kid that you like,

19:15.655 --> 19:18.758
who needs a stage tuner,
'cause that's worth about $20.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.793
- Eh, so the kids smile.
- Yeah.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.697
This being early '80s
would probably bring $75.

19:24.731 --> 19:26.866
- Okay.
- This one is--

19:26.899 --> 19:29.336
you're probably,
if you find the right guy

19:29.369 --> 19:32.071
who really had to have one,
$150.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.172
And this is the money.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.707
It's not
in the greatest condition,

19:34.741 --> 19:37.344
but I would say, um...

19:37.377 --> 19:40.447
*

19:40.480 --> 19:41.714
$1,000.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.884
- That's good.
I'm shocked. I love it.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.253
- You wanna hear
your Boss overdrive?

19:46.286 --> 19:47.454
- All right, let's do that.

19:47.487 --> 19:49.188
- Let's see if I can get
anything out of it.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.490
*

19:53.526 --> 20:00.567
*

20:01.701 --> 20:03.035
*

20:03.069 --> 20:04.571
male narrator: Darrell Sheets
got his licks in

20:04.604 --> 20:06.339
and rocked the competition,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.908
banking over $9,000 big ones.

20:08.941 --> 20:12.545
Mary Padian made the most
of her pasta-bilities,

20:12.579 --> 20:15.848
spooning up $215.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.817
Rene Nezhoda got distracted

20:17.850 --> 20:20.820
and left with nothing
but a dent in his car.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.856
And Kenny Crossley might have
struck out at the auction,

20:23.890 --> 20:26.726
but plans on scoring at home.

20:26.759 --> 20:27.727
- Sexy.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.028
- Pasta!

20:29.061 --> 20:30.863
Get your pasta!

20:30.897 --> 20:33.333
Prince of Venice pas--
oh,

20:33.366 --> 20:35.868
Would you like a sample?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.870
Just--you could take
a little nibble.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.171
See if you like it.

20:39.205 --> 20:41.941
Can't turn down
a free sample of pasta.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.643
- Mm-hmm.

20:43.676 --> 20:44.844
- Mm-hmm.
- Two takers.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.013
We got two takers.

20:47.046 --> 20:48.615
- Mmm.
- I'm not doing that.
