00:02.252 --> 00:03.920
<i>Previously on Justified...</i>

00:04.003 --> 00:05.588
I just want to hear you say it.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.090
Frankfort.

00:08.175 --> 00:09.300
What are they offering?

00:09.635 --> 00:11.761
I write them prescriptions.

00:12.096 --> 00:14.555
They offer protection and Oxy.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.516
What do you want me to do?

00:16.600 --> 00:18.434
Well, you're a doctor. I want you to sell it.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.478
Sell their Oxy and give you the money?

00:22.106 --> 00:23.189
Jesus!

00:23.273 --> 00:26.776
Now, you tell your boss
if he has anything to say in reply,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.736
I'll be at my cousin Johnny's bar.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.530
Bottom line, Boyd.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.491
You and I'd make a lot more money
as partners than as enemies.

00:33.951 --> 00:36.953
Mr. Quarles,
have you heard the term "carpetbagger"?

00:37.162 --> 00:38.329
Yes, I'm familiar with the term.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.708
Well, then you know to a carpetbagger,
"partners" just means that,

00:41.792 --> 00:44.627
well, we do all the work
while you make all the money.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.338
<i>I'm still not gonna fight with you.</i>

00:47.423 --> 00:49.882
<i>I'm done trying to change who you are.</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:07.442
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.194
Hey!

01:10.863 --> 01:12.780
How about a little something for the effort?

01:13.782 --> 01:15.032
Why not?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.578
God bless you, girls.

01:24.501 --> 01:25.626
Hey.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.089
- Can we go on back?
- Yeah.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.928
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.015
Aren't you handsome? Here. This is for you.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.184
Fill, please.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.731
All right.

01:48.192 --> 01:50.610
Oh, no. That ain't gonna be enough.

01:50.694 --> 01:52.612
- No, we want one of those big ones...
- It's gonna have to do,

01:52.696 --> 01:54.113
'cause that's all you're getting.

01:54.740 --> 01:56.949
- That's not all we're getting.
- No.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.452
Come on, baby.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.539
There's got to be a little wiggle room
in there somewhere.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.374
Sorry. It's a controlled substance.

02:05.584 --> 02:09.628
From what I can tell, you're the only one
around here controlling anything.

02:10.923 --> 02:13.382
- Maybe he just needs a little help...
- Oh, yeah.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.719
...to get his mind off of all them
rules and regulations

02:16.845 --> 02:18.596
tumbling around up in your head.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.224
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no. Please don't! Please!

03:06.562 --> 03:07.937
Get the Oxy.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.736
Hurry up, man!

03:19.283 --> 03:21.033
Gayle, it's Raylan.

03:21.743 --> 03:25.246
Listen, I'm sorry to call like this.
It's a little awkward,

03:26.957 --> 03:30.459
but if you hear from Winona,
will you ask her to call me?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.963
Just want to make sure she's okay.

03:36.341 --> 03:39.760
No, I don't need you to pull it over.
Just a BOLO on the plate will suffice.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.513
Appreciate it, Tom.

03:48.145 --> 03:50.730
- Can I help you?
- No, I'm good.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.776
I'm Mabel Johnston, the new court reporter,
and that's my desk.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.029
- Since when?
- Excuse me?

03:58.322 --> 04:01.824
Since when is this your desk?
And is this you looking up Costa Rica?

04:06.663 --> 04:08.831
Hey. Hey. Raylan.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.875
- Judge.
- Now, now, Ms. Johnston,

04:10.959 --> 04:12.919
this man is a decorated marshal

04:13.003 --> 04:15.838
who has personally saved my bacon
on more than one occasion.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.714
That give him the right
to go through my computer?

04:17.798 --> 04:19.926
That computer belongs
to the federal government,

04:20.010 --> 04:21.677
and you still haven't answered my questions.

04:21.970 --> 04:25.097
Tell you what, darling. What don't you just
give us a few minutes, would you, please?

04:25.182 --> 04:26.682
Thank you.

04:28.727 --> 04:30.102
What's going on, Raylan?

04:31.939 --> 04:34.315
Winona and I were making another go of it.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.984
Oh, shit. She at least leave you a note?

04:37.152 --> 04:38.778
- Do you know where she is?
- Oh, boy.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.072
She give you any indication
where she might be headed?

04:41.156 --> 04:43.532
Raylan, you're talking to a man
who's had two wives head for the hills,

04:43.617 --> 04:47.036
neither of whom was as good-looking
as Winona, so I get it. You're hurting.

04:47.871 --> 04:52.375
Just trust me on this. Let it be.
Give her time to sort it out.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.460
Can't do that.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.836
What are you gonna do
when you find her, huh?

04:55.921 --> 04:57.880
Gonna hit her on the head
and drag her back home?

04:57.965 --> 04:59.215
I probably shouldn't. She's pregnant.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.259
Well, then she'll reach out when she's ready.

05:02.344 --> 05:05.888
What you do not want to do
is go poking around in her life.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.391
Chances are, you're gonna find something
you wish you hadn't.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.579
- Morning, Charlie.
- Hey. Marshal Givens.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.665
What brings you down
to this neck of the woods?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.458
Oh, you know.

05:34.835 --> 05:37.169
Do you want to help me out?
Be a little more specific?

05:37.254 --> 05:38.295
I think I can handle it.

05:38.380 --> 05:40.589
If you just want to leave the book
and the keys, I'll get to it.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.009
Well, if you gonna do that,
what are they paying me for?

05:43.093 --> 05:48.556
It's some evidence from a bank robbery
a while back. I believe it's in 247.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.017
All right.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.320
You owe me big for that one.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.115
Anything interesting?

06:48.784 --> 06:51.452
I don't mind asking the FBI
for favors on your behalf,

06:51.536 --> 06:53.954
but I'm not gonna read the thing for you, too.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.247
Thanks.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.336
Raylan.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.635
- Just got off the phone with Tom Bergen.
- Oh, yeah?

07:07.719 --> 07:10.679
Apparently there was a shoot-out
down in Harlan this weekend...

07:10.764 --> 07:12.890
Art, I'm sorry to interrupt.

07:14.392 --> 07:15.810
I need some time off.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.937
Are you trying to be funny?

07:18.021 --> 07:19.396
I'm being serious.

07:19.523 --> 07:21.398
Why? 'Cause you shot the woman?

07:22.025 --> 07:23.526
Raylan, look,

07:23.860 --> 07:28.280
I know you must be worried about
whether you're too quick on the trigger,

07:28.406 --> 07:30.282
but what were you supposed to do?

07:30.367 --> 07:32.326
Be a gentleman and let her go first?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.370
Not when she's pointing a gun at you.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.663
Winona left me.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.715
Well, shit.

07:47.509 --> 07:48.592
Yeah.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.055
- Well, Raylan, I'm sorry about that.
- It's all right.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.058
- But you're...
- No. Don't need a pep talk.

07:56.184 --> 07:58.561
Just a few days off to get my head straight.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.647
You're gonna have to head down to Harlan
and take care of this shit

08:01.731 --> 08:03.649
before it blows up all over this office.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.818
Art, just find someone else.

08:05.902 --> 08:10.030
The shooting in question took place at your
Aunt Helen's property out on Indian Line.

08:16.413 --> 08:18.831
I couldn't get any details.
The cops were all over the place.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.750
But there was a coroner's van out front.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.712
You talk to Arlo?

08:24.796 --> 08:25.838
No.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.631
You think it was Quarles?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.341
That's obvious, ain't it?

08:29.426 --> 08:32.469
We shanghaied the man's doctor,
put him to work for us.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.847
I don't want to jump to any conclusions
until we know for certain.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.183
Hey, he's got his own trailer
set up out there at Dove Creek.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.561
I think we should hit him back.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.229
We could use the money, Boyd.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.232
Johnny, don't tell me
you can't get any details.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.611
I want you to go back out to that house,
and you don't call me

08:49.029 --> 08:51.655
until you can start filling in some blanks.

08:52.699 --> 08:53.866
Go on.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.999
Let's go for a drive.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.169
- How many guys were there?
- There were like one or maybe two.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.420
Did you see their faces?

09:06.504 --> 09:09.006
- I didn't... Oh, I did, I did.
- Did they see you?

09:09.174 --> 09:12.301
No.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.305
Take a deep breath. God damn, girl.
That does sound horrible.

09:16.431 --> 09:17.765
Okay. I know.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.266
- Oh, Jesus!
- Here.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.852
- Oh, my God. Jesus.
- Let me... Let me take...

09:21.937 --> 09:24.271
- I got to get a...
- Here, put that on.

09:26.942 --> 09:28.984
Something like that happens,
seeing a dear friend shot up...

09:29.069 --> 09:30.110
Yeah.

09:30.195 --> 09:32.029
...shakes you right down
to the very core, don't it?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.240
I know. I know that.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.244
It's terrible, and I am sympathetic.

09:39.079 --> 09:42.414
But you must understand
that we need them pills.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.583
- I know.
- I know you do.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.419
Now, there's another clinic
out on Dove Creek. It just opened.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.880
- No, I can't.
- Okay, baby. I understand.

09:49.965 --> 09:52.424
It just opened. You can't go there.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.515
Did I ever tell you about my upbringing?

10:02.978 --> 10:08.023
My parents raised me in a commune of sorts.

10:09.192 --> 10:13.362
They did. I wouldn't call it hippie, exactly.
It was mostly dope farmers.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.031
But strange as that group was,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.826
as strange as it was, we were a family.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.162
We looked after each other.

10:22.247 --> 10:24.290
Just like we do here.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.208
- I know.
- I know you do.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.584
I know.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.462
Now, try to see it from my side.

10:30.547 --> 10:32.715
It ain't easy looking after you girls.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.427
There's doctors and clothing and food,
whatnot, right?

10:36.553 --> 10:38.679
Whoring don't nearly pay the bills.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.056
It's them pills that keeps
a roof over our heads.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.183
Please get someone else.

10:43.268 --> 10:46.562
No. Nope, nope, nope, nope. This is on you.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.733
Like everyone else,
you must be willing to make a sacrifice.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.235
Listen to me. Listen to me.

10:53.653 --> 10:57.364
Now, poor Trixie gave her life. For what?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.786
- It's your turn. Come on, now.
- No.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.163
Yeah. Now, hold on.

11:04.247 --> 11:08.459
You will lay your fear aside
and do what needs to be done.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.172
Now, don't you come back
till you got everything I need.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.261
<i>Hi. You've reached Winona.</i>

11:19.387 --> 11:22.264
<i>I can't get to the phone right now,
but if you'll leave a message...</i>

11:27.395 --> 11:30.814
The good Dr. Stern there
had Arlo's name in his phone.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.776
So does every doctor in the county,
I imagine.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.695
Raylan, you trying to tell me you had
no idea what was going on in this house?

11:36.780 --> 11:40.199
Tom, I had no idea what was going on
in this house when I lived here.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.118
- Anything on that BOLO?
- No. ls everything okay?

11:43.536 --> 11:47.414
Yeah. But it'd be a big help
if I thought you could handle this.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.250
Just go talk to Arlo, huh?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.252
- We did talk to Arlo.
- And?

11:52.837 --> 11:57.424
He told us to direct any questions
we might have to his son, the US Marshal.

12:25.328 --> 12:28.914
This includes your fake MRI and new ID.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.376
Make sure you go over it all
before you meet with the doctor.

12:38.216 --> 12:40.175
Come on. Got people waiting.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.473
I'm good.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.519
You good? Shit, girl.
What does that even mean, you "good"?

12:51.729 --> 12:52.896
I just...

13:06.202 --> 13:07.703
Mr. Limehouse.

13:08.371 --> 13:09.371
Sir.

13:09.456 --> 13:13.041
You two hungry?
I got a new blend on that spicy sauce.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.428
What's on your mind?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.014
Well, the night I came out
to see you on the bridge,

13:27.098 --> 13:30.392
you told me something about my business
that even I didn't know.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.894
And I got to wondering,

13:32.687 --> 13:37.483
how come you know so much about me
while I know so little about you?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.949
You know him? That's A.C. Coleman.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.868
Family been here long as mine.

13:47.952 --> 13:52.748
Part of the original group deeded this holler
by Jeremiah and Eliza Noble.

13:53.750 --> 13:56.543
What about him,
the big boy with the plate of ribs?

13:56.794 --> 13:57.961
He look familiar to you?

14:00.131 --> 14:01.215
Jennings.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.801
- Who this is?
- Boyd Crowder.

14:04.886 --> 14:06.470
Daddy was Bo. Dead.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.097
Brother named Bowman. Also dead.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.891
And if I may say so,

14:10.975 --> 14:14.853
Boyd done done a lot of things that
leave me right surprised he's sitting here.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.191
It's always been our business to know you.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.694
Us knowing is the business of this holler.

14:22.779 --> 14:27.074
Now, why you don't know us is a question
that you are welcome to ponder

14:27.784 --> 14:30.202
once you leave away from around here.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.954
Well, our Oxy clinic got hit this morning.

14:32.997 --> 14:35.290
- I imagine you know that, too.
- I do.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.959
Well, I've been thinking it was Frankfort.

14:37.043 --> 14:40.045
A man named Quarles
with whom I've recently become acquainted.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.422
But before I hit back and start a war,

14:42.507 --> 14:45.467
I need to know everything I can
about what transpired.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.638
The people who bank with me are the ones
who have access to the things I know.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.056
Well, I'm glad you said that,

14:51.140 --> 14:53.767
because I've been thinking
about moving all my cash

14:53.851 --> 14:56.562
with a Ellstin Limehouse up in Nobles Holler.

14:58.523 --> 15:01.692
Well, I can't speak to Frankfort,
but what I do know is

15:01.818 --> 15:03.485
two of the victims was your people,

15:03.570 --> 15:06.488
and the third was a young working girl
named Trixie.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.844
You still think Limehouse
had something to do with it?

15:29.554 --> 15:31.013
I do not know.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.849
Wasn't acting like a guilty man.

15:34.225 --> 15:37.019
And Johnny's right, Quarles has
every reason to come after us.

15:37.103 --> 15:39.104
Yeah, but Quarles is a very smart man,

15:39.188 --> 15:41.982
and for him to make a run at us like this,
that's mighty brazen.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.527
You know anything about Trixie?

15:46.487 --> 15:48.030
Worked at Audrey's.

15:48.698 --> 15:51.116
She's joined at the hip
to another girl over there, Ellen May.

15:51.868 --> 15:55.162
Well, maybe I should get down to Audrey's
and have a chat with Ellen May.

15:55.705 --> 15:56.788
What?

15:56.873 --> 16:00.500
I'm thinking she might be more likely
to open up to a woman.

16:03.880 --> 16:07.382
Come in here, moving the furniture,
hiding my shit.

16:08.343 --> 16:09.760
God damn it, woman.

16:09.844 --> 16:14.056
I don't find them,
I'm gonna lay a strap across your back.

16:21.356 --> 16:22.439
Who you talking to?

16:22.690 --> 16:25.734
Sneak up on a man like that
a good way to get yourself shot.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.488
By you in your boxer shorts there?
I think I got the drop on you this time, Arlo.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.822
What the hell do you want?

16:30.907 --> 16:31.948
You know why I'm here.

16:32.033 --> 16:34.910
I already told that pencil-dick statie
I got nothing to say.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.538
- You said more than that.
- That's right. "Talk to Raylan," I said.

16:38.873 --> 16:42.501
All right, look. I know you don't
give a shit about me or my job,

16:42.585 --> 16:44.461
and I've given up expecting you to act right.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.838
But you know the position
you're putting me in here, Arlo?

16:46.923 --> 16:48.090
Missionary.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.802
You want to die in prison, Arlo,
just say the word. I'll help make it happen.

16:52.512 --> 16:57.349
You? All I got to do is raise my hand.
You'll go running to Helen like a little girl.

16:58.726 --> 17:00.560
I don't got time for this bullshit.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.270
Tell me what was going on over there.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.021
And don't say you were
honoring her memory

17:04.107 --> 17:05.816
by setting up an Oxy clinic in her home.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.984
I didn't set nothing up.
Was just helping the boy.

17:09.112 --> 17:10.444
What boy?

17:10.988 --> 17:12.280
The Crowder boy.

17:13.074 --> 17:14.657
- Boyd?
- Hell, yes, Boyd.

17:15.660 --> 17:20.122
Ain't Bowman. He's dead. Now go on.
Find something to do. I'm busy here.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.005
Come here.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.094
Now, it pains me to do this to you, truly.

17:34.262 --> 17:37.139
But you've got to learn accountability,
just like I had to.

17:37.807 --> 17:40.767
No, no! I went, I did! I went to the trailer.

17:41.227 --> 17:44.271
I went, but the guy
who killed Trixie was there.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.606
And he recognized you?

17:47.608 --> 17:50.360
- Did he recognize you?
- I don't think so! I don't think so.

17:55.450 --> 18:00.162
I need you to understand
that you have failed me twice.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.915
Now, you remember that.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.298
No, no, no, no. Send him down right away.

18:11.841 --> 18:14.509
We got a lot of exciting things
going on down here.

18:14.635 --> 18:17.179
I'm sure Sammy would love to see it.

18:18.723 --> 18:22.017
Okay. We'll be expecting him. Okay. Bye-bye.

18:26.105 --> 18:29.733
Get me everything you can find
on the good Marshal Givens.

18:30.026 --> 18:32.068
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah.

18:32.403 --> 18:34.863
His interest in me is drawing attention.

18:35.406 --> 18:36.615
From whom?

18:36.699 --> 18:39.951
I was just informed that someone
in the Lexington FBI office

18:40.036 --> 18:44.206
is asking questions about me,
and I'm assuming it is at Givens' behest.

18:45.041 --> 18:48.418
If the marshal keeps coming
and it becomes necessary to apply pressure,

18:48.544 --> 18:51.254
I want to know exactly where to squeeze.

18:52.215 --> 18:53.840
Sure thing, boss.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.176
"Boss."

18:59.555 --> 19:00.931
I like that.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.725
You're a good man, Wynn.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.440
I'll see you soon.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.069
Yeah.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.343
It just occurred to me, I completely...

20:10.960 --> 20:12.460
Hello, beautiful.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.297
- Can I help you?
- I doubt it. Excuse me.

20:15.506 --> 20:20.385
Now, wait a second, darling.
Where's the fire? You know who I am?

20:21.178 --> 20:23.555
I'm Delroy, the owner of this establishment.

20:24.307 --> 20:26.224
I thought Nicky Cush ran Audrey's.

20:26.309 --> 20:29.144
No, Nicky decided it was time
to move on to greener pastures.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.855
- Well, in that case, I'm Ava.
- Hello, Ava.

20:33.816 --> 20:35.317
- Want to have a sit?
- Sure.

20:37.612 --> 20:41.031
Now, if you are the man in charge,
then maybe you can help me.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.325
Please tell me you've come here
looking for a job, darling,

20:43.409 --> 20:48.371
'cause I forgot to play the lottery this week,
and you, right here, are the winning ticket.

20:49.332 --> 20:52.334
That's sweet. But I already got a job.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.003
See, I work at the Cut & Color in Corbin.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.840
A while back, I did a favor
for one of your girls, Ellen May.

20:59.842 --> 21:03.345
Then I got hurt, so I was laid up for a while,
and now I need the cash.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.806
Well, hell, if it's cash you need,
you ought to consider my offer.

21:06.891 --> 21:09.851
Ditch the burnt-out permanents
and the church-lady blue rinses.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.394
That's a waste of you.

21:11.520 --> 21:15.565
Yeah. I don't... I guess I'd just rather
get what's owed me and be on my way.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.777
All right. Well, Ellen May ain't feeling well.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.862
She didn't come in. I haven't seen her all day.

21:22.156 --> 21:23.907
What happened there?

21:24.867 --> 21:28.328
Yard work.
Some weeds needed to be dealt with.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.122
Well, thank you.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.458
You change your mind,
you know where to find me.

21:34.418 --> 21:36.419
- Have a good day, now, Ava.
- You, too.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.176
Ava.

21:44.804 --> 21:46.054
I wouldn't do that.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.555
When Delroy sees you
heading for the trailers,

21:47.723 --> 21:49.557
he's gonna do to you
what he already done to Ellen May.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.894
You don't remember me, do you?

21:53.980 --> 21:55.772
I'm Jennifer Corliss.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.192
- But everybody, they call me...
- Call you J.J.

21:59.860 --> 22:01.486
You were a year behind me in high school.

22:01.570 --> 22:04.280
Middle school.
I never made it to high school.

22:05.074 --> 22:08.076
Ellen May, she don't
owe you money, do she?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.411
No, she doesn't.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.621
Is this something to do
with what she saw in that clinic?

22:13.666 --> 22:17.419
And this woman, she thinks Ellen May
witnessed the whole thing?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.004
Yep.

22:19.422 --> 22:23.341
But Ellen May's back in her trailer,
and I can't get to her without Delroy seeing.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.972
Ava, honey, you hold tight.
I'll get right back to you.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.141
Everybody, join me in a toast.

22:31.475 --> 22:34.978
To celebrate the presence
of a genuine United States Marshal,

22:35.604 --> 22:36.730
next round is on me.

22:36.939 --> 22:40.650
You gonna pay for that with the money
you made selling Oxy at my aunt's house?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.736
I'm gonna go confer with my friend.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.946
Now, remember, we on the honor system.

22:53.122 --> 22:55.623
- Raylan, let me just say...
- So, this is the new you, huh?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.001
Bartending, pushing pills.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.503
Moved on from swastika
and rocket launchers.

23:00.755 --> 23:01.921
Well, the truth be told, Raylan,

23:02.006 --> 23:04.758
these days I'm doing whatever I can
to make ends meet.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.135
Is that what was going down
at Helen's house?

23:07.344 --> 23:08.845
That was just you making ends meet.

23:08.971 --> 23:11.598
Look, I am sorry your name
got dragged into this, Raylan,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.059
but with everything that is
going on in this county,

23:14.143 --> 23:15.518
I am not the problem.

23:15.686 --> 23:18.271
It's the Jews, or the blacks.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.608
Maybe it's the Muslims.
The Taliban got you down?

23:21.776 --> 23:26.529
I know it's anyone but you, Boyd,
so, tell me, who is the problem this time?

23:26.655 --> 23:28.156
Well, it's funny that you bring it up that way,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.408
because I've been thinking
about that question all day long.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.368
- I bet.
- Now, I think, I think,

23:32.495 --> 23:34.954
if you were to go down to Audrey's,
Ava's there.

23:35.039 --> 23:37.082
Stop talking and listen.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.668
You want to run
your hillbilly heroin fiefdom up here,

23:40.753 --> 23:43.046
that's between you
and the great state of Kentucky.

23:43.172 --> 23:45.965
I got no interest
in shitkicker-on-shitkicker crime.

23:46.050 --> 23:48.009
But you will not drag me into this.

23:48.094 --> 23:51.763
The next time you set up any operation
in this county or anywhere else,

23:51.847 --> 23:54.682
it better not have
my goddamn family name on the deed,

23:54.767 --> 23:57.352
or, so help me God, I'll lose this star,

23:57.728 --> 24:00.522
and the dance we do subsequent to that

24:00.606 --> 24:04.025
will not end with you
finding Jesus in a hospital bed.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.533
Go see Ava.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.541
You love it, don't you?

24:20.668 --> 24:23.086
Getting the law to do your dirty work.

24:23.712 --> 24:26.965
Well, I got a big tank, Raylan.
It does save on gas.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.391
Raylan is on his way to you.

24:44.233 --> 24:45.900
What you got for me?

24:47.153 --> 24:48.570
It's nice to see you, too.

24:49.113 --> 24:50.280
What you got for me?

24:55.828 --> 24:57.245
God damn it.

24:59.165 --> 25:00.331
Ellen May?

25:00.416 --> 25:03.251
Oh, my God. Marshal. Hi.

25:03.419 --> 25:04.794
You remember me this time, huh?

25:05.087 --> 25:06.754
You two know each other?

25:07.756 --> 25:09.090
Yeah, we've met.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.217
Sit down, honey.

25:12.261 --> 25:13.720
Did Delroy do that to you?

25:14.096 --> 25:16.931
- Is it that bad?
- I've seen worse. Hey.

25:17.641 --> 25:20.977
Now, if you dissolve some salt in hot water,
dip some cotton balls in it

25:21.187 --> 25:23.188
and put it on your bruises,
it'll keep them from getting darker.

25:25.065 --> 25:28.359
- Rough day, Ellen?
- It's been a tough year, Marshal.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.987
I'm sorry to hear it.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.281
So, you guys here for...

25:38.537 --> 25:39.787
- No.
- No.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.457
You're here for the Oxy clinic.

25:44.293 --> 25:45.293
Okay.

25:48.297 --> 25:51.382
Shit, I guess my invite to this little partay
got lost in the mail.

25:51.467 --> 25:53.343
No, actually, you just weren't invited.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.887
No, see, this here is my partay,

25:55.971 --> 25:58.389
and if you want to partake,
you got to see me first.

25:58.724 --> 26:01.184
- Do you understand?
- Yeah, I do. But not today.

26:01.268 --> 26:02.560
Today's opposite day.

26:02.645 --> 26:06.356
So if you got business in here,
you need to go outside and wait your turn.

26:06.482 --> 26:09.817
Yeah? And what if I got no patience
and I hate waiting?

26:10.945 --> 26:13.154
Shit. I didn't bring a knife.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.534
That jewelry, it's your lucky day.

26:18.953 --> 26:21.079
Go outside and wait your turn.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.792
Seeing as you're the law,
you got three minutes.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.877
Then I'm coming back in here.

26:28.003 --> 26:29.462
- I'm looking forward to it.
- Yeah.

26:32.925 --> 26:37.845
Ellen May, however you want this
to go down, I will try to oblige.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.099
But I need you to tell me what you know.

26:46.355 --> 26:49.857
You're lucky, Tex, 'cause you had
about 10 seconds left before I was...

26:52.361 --> 26:53.361
Shit!

26:53.445 --> 26:56.197
Haul your ass in for beating her,
but a few hours,

26:56.282 --> 26:58.658
she'd probably be the one
who bailed you out, sad as it is.

26:58.742 --> 26:59.951
So here's the deal.

27:00.577 --> 27:04.789
I'm gonna leave you both here,
but I need her kept safe. You understand?

27:05.541 --> 27:09.544
Anything happens to her,
I'm gonna hold you personally responsible.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.296
So, what are you gonna do?

27:11.714 --> 27:13.840
You have no idea...

27:15.801 --> 27:16.884
Hey.

27:17.386 --> 27:19.053
What are you gonna do?

27:19.138 --> 27:21.014
Make sure Ellen May don't get hurt.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.476
Thanks for coming by, Raylan.

27:38.365 --> 27:39.490
Hey, I think we got a problem.

27:45.039 --> 27:48.041
All right, that's it for today!
Everyone move on out!

27:51.003 --> 27:53.463
Get in the cab. When he gets inside,
you punch it. You understand me?

27:53.547 --> 27:54.964
Got it.

27:57.051 --> 27:58.301
Where's everybody going?

28:00.763 --> 28:02.638
Afraid it's about closing time for us.

28:02.723 --> 28:06.225
Oh, yeah?
You just close up and move on, huh?

28:07.186 --> 28:08.644
Like the circus.

28:08.729 --> 28:09.937
Community clinic.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.357
Hold up. Are you a bearded lady?

28:12.941 --> 28:15.068
No, sir.
We're a legitimate health organization.

28:15.152 --> 28:17.570
Oh, yeah? Well, I got a few more questions.
Do you mind?

28:17.905 --> 28:19.447
Sure thing. After you.

28:20.074 --> 28:21.949
No, no. After you.

28:24.244 --> 28:26.996
- That's quite a limp you got there.
- Yeah. Old football injury.

28:27.081 --> 28:31.000
That right? Tell me what you know about
the Oxy clinic over on Indian Line.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.293
- Nothing.
- You sure?

28:32.461 --> 28:34.796
You fit the description of a man
an eyewitness described

28:34.880 --> 28:36.798
murdering three people there this morning.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.702
Still no sign of the guy
I threw out the trailer, huh?

29:47.786 --> 29:50.455
No. We got the dog teams coming out
to search the woods,

29:50.539 --> 29:52.540
but he had a pretty good head start on us.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.208
Yeah, I don't know how fast he'd be going.

29:54.293 --> 29:57.211
He hit the ground at a pretty good clip,
plus he was limping to begin with.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.379
Is that right?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.423
- Keep me posted.
- I will.

30:03.218 --> 30:07.430
- Nothing on the BOLO?
- No. Sorry, Raylan. We got lucky last time.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.557
Last time?

30:10.017 --> 30:12.727
Yeah. When you was in the hospital
after you got shot,

30:13.270 --> 30:17.523
I guess nobody could find Winona,
so Art had us put out a BOLO on her.

30:18.233 --> 30:19.901
I didn't know that.

30:20.569 --> 30:23.237
One of our boys located her
outside Louisville.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.739
Louisville?

30:25.240 --> 30:26.365
Yeah.

30:27.701 --> 30:28.910
Thanks.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.207
Wynn.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.712
Well, you look like a man
who has something to say.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.718
There have been some interesting
developments down in Harlan.

30:45.928 --> 30:47.428
I'm listening.

30:47.596 --> 30:51.098
Boyd Crowder's Oxy clinic
was hit this morning.

30:51.391 --> 30:53.226
Well, ain't that a kick in the head?

30:54.061 --> 30:55.269
Who do we have to thank for that?

30:55.521 --> 30:56.979
It wasn't you?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.440
Little obvious for my tastes,

30:59.525 --> 31:02.109
though I'm sure you won't be alone
in thinking that I was responsible.

31:02.194 --> 31:04.445
It may be a coincidence,
but a few hours after the hit,

31:04.988 --> 31:07.532
Raylan Givens shut down our trailer.

31:07.658 --> 31:09.784
Gus was killed.
Teddy and Tanner slipped away.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.207
Oh, shit. That's awesome.

31:16.291 --> 31:18.584
Is it? Because that isn't the word
I would have used.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.462
Oh, come on. That's not a bad trade-off.

31:21.964 --> 31:25.383
Losing a clinic but smoking out
a dirty marshal in the process.

31:25.467 --> 31:27.385
Raylan Givens never struck me as bent.

31:27.469 --> 31:28.469
Oh, come on.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.722
There's no way Givens is onto our clinic
that fast without an inside lead.

31:31.807 --> 31:33.891
I'm just surprised that Crowder
has that kind of pull.

31:33.976 --> 31:37.395
I mean, to have a marshal
in your back pocket, that is a big play.

31:38.939 --> 31:39.981
Yeah.

31:40.482 --> 31:41.566
"Yeah" what?

31:41.692 --> 31:45.653
Givens' father, Arlo, is a part of Boyd's crew.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.712
So, how was your day, son?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.006
Was it a good day?

32:05.674 --> 32:07.925
Was it a productive day?

32:08.010 --> 32:10.011
Was it memorable?

32:11.638 --> 32:12.847
How'd you figure it out?

32:13.056 --> 32:16.225
Is that really the question
you want to ask me right now?

32:16.351 --> 32:18.144
I was gonna bring it to you
soon as the dust settled.

32:18.228 --> 32:19.604
"Dust settled." Shit.

32:21.481 --> 32:23.441
You still don't even know
what you done, do you?

32:23.859 --> 32:25.234
I was just trying to clear the playing field.

32:25.319 --> 32:27.111
- You know, get us control of things...
- Why?

32:27.446 --> 32:28.571
What?

32:28.655 --> 32:31.824
Say you was able to start a war
between Frankfort and Crowder.

32:31.908 --> 32:35.578
Nobody ever found out you fired
the shot that started the whole thing,

32:36.330 --> 32:39.206
and they wipe each other
off the face of this Earth. Then what?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.292
Then we run this shit.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.045
So that's what you want. Be a gangster.

32:44.504 --> 32:47.506
Gold chains and champagne
and hos and shit.

32:48.467 --> 32:54.096
Oh, son. We have survived
in these hills on our own

32:54.514 --> 32:58.309
for 15 decades by staying among ourselves.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.519
Yeah, but it ain't got to be like that anymore.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.231
When your foolishness
brings this war to our doorstep,

33:05.067 --> 33:06.734
how long do you think we gonna last then?

33:06.860 --> 33:08.444
What we got to be scared of?

33:08.820 --> 33:10.696
They got guns. We got guns, too.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.782
Guns enough for the law?

33:13.283 --> 33:16.786
And for all the hillbillies
that are gonna start taking it personal

33:17.120 --> 33:19.372
when we start killing white folks?

33:20.207 --> 33:24.377
They always wanted us gone,
and now you done exposed us

33:25.796 --> 33:29.674
to every buried hate-filled desire
in this county.

33:30.884 --> 33:32.593
And when the blood starts to spill,

33:33.387 --> 33:35.388
it will be on your hands.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.683
All right. You right.

33:40.102 --> 33:41.268
I stepped out.

33:44.606 --> 33:47.108
You gonna have to do
what you gonna have to do then,

33:47.192 --> 33:50.236
'cause I'd rather die on my feet
than live on my knees.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.411
No. You ain't gonna get off that easy.

33:59.454 --> 34:02.915
Now, first, you gonna make things right
with Trixie's family.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.419
That girl trusted us,
and you done got her killed.

34:06.878 --> 34:11.757
Then you gonna make sure
whoever you used to hit that clinic

34:13.135 --> 34:15.803
is either dead or silent.

34:16.763 --> 34:20.933
And then, then I suppose
I'm gonna finish what you started.

34:21.016 --> 34:24.018
And you gonna be right there
on the front line

34:24.896 --> 34:28.399
to watch all that you done created
come to a head,

34:29.234 --> 34:31.777
one way or another.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.960
- No.
- I haven't said anything.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.629
Well, when you do, the answer will be "no."

34:53.632 --> 34:55.509
You never called me back.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.345
- She's my baby sister, Raylan.
- Well, I need to see her.

34:58.513 --> 35:02.433
- Well, didn't we just cover that?
- Look, it's not that simple, Gayle.

35:03.393 --> 35:04.727
I'm here on official business.

35:05.520 --> 35:06.937
You've got to be kidding.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.775
All right. There are two ways this can go.

35:11.902 --> 35:15.404
You can go get her,
or I'll come in and get her myself.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.364
Try it.

35:19.534 --> 35:22.077
Gayle, it's okay.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.461
Behave yourself.

35:32.047 --> 35:34.882
- I guess you didn't read my note.
- Oh, no. I read it.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.550
Both sentences.

35:36.635 --> 35:39.220
Each so terse, I figured
you must have written it at gunpoint.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.473
When I saw that Costa Rica shit
on your computer,

35:42.557 --> 35:45.309
that's when I realized
you took the goddamn money.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.977
What? What money?
What are you talking about?

35:47.062 --> 35:50.564
If you think I'm gonna help you put it
back this time, then you really are crazy.

35:50.941 --> 35:55.069
You came here because you thought I took
evidence money to go to Costa Rica?

35:56.029 --> 35:59.156
Raylan, I know that note was abrupt,
but that doesn't mean I...

35:59.241 --> 36:01.075
How about,
"I'm sorry I wrote the note at all"?

36:01.159 --> 36:02.868
I didn't...
But I didn't steal any money, Raylan.

36:02.953 --> 36:04.745
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not lying to you.

36:11.086 --> 36:13.087
Then why did you disappear like that?

36:13.547 --> 36:15.589
Because I found myself
in the middle of an empty house

36:15.674 --> 36:17.508
almost two months pregnant
with nowhere to go.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.471
I know. I'm supposed to have looked at some
houses, and I haven't done that yet, but...

36:22.556 --> 36:23.597
Raylan.

36:23.682 --> 36:27.184
No, just listen to me.
Can we get your stuff and get out of here?

36:29.229 --> 36:30.855
I thought you wanted
to go to Glynco anyway.

36:30.939 --> 36:34.441
Yeah, and since the last time you
brought up Glynco, you've been shot.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.027
And I watched you shoot a guy
in your motel room.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.363
The third guy, might I add,
that you've shot in that motel room.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.616
So, you want me to raise
a baby around that, Raylan? I can't do that.

36:42.701 --> 36:45.703
Fine. Don't. Let's go.
We can go to Glynco still.

36:50.417 --> 36:51.458
Oh, my God.

36:51.585 --> 36:52.585
What?

36:52.669 --> 36:53.878
Do you remember,
when we were first married,

36:53.962 --> 36:56.714
that Tuesday-night poker game
you used to go to?

36:57.382 --> 36:59.967
Come hell or high water,
you never missed that poker game.

37:00.093 --> 37:03.596
You even chased a fugitive

37:04.097 --> 37:07.141
for three days straight without any sleep
over a weekend, I swear to God,

37:07.225 --> 37:09.143
to go to that stupid poker game.

37:09.895 --> 37:11.437
- What's your point?
- My point is,

37:11.855 --> 37:15.441
if you wanted to change your life for me,
Raylan, you would have done so by now.

37:28.830 --> 37:30.456
So, that's it. You're gone, huh?

37:31.666 --> 37:33.042
I've been gone for weeks.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.259
I can't believe you thought
I took that money again

37:42.344 --> 37:44.428
after all the shit we went through
to put it back.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.513
Saw all that Kenny Chesney
on your computer,

37:46.598 --> 37:48.140
I figured you were capable of anything.

37:48.350 --> 37:50.893
- I love Kenny Chesney.
- Apparently you do.

37:58.401 --> 38:01.320
So, what now? How does this work?

38:01.696 --> 38:03.739
Me and you apart and a baby between us?

38:03.865 --> 38:05.366
I don't know.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.665
But I know we still love each other.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.877
And we'll love the baby.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.296
And we'll figure it out.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.804
We weren't even fighting.

38:26.888 --> 38:30.224
Well, you know you're in trouble
when the drums stop.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.688
Says the man who knew
she already left me just a few weeks ago.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.191
I didn't know she'd leave you again.

38:39.526 --> 38:40.985
That's funny.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.322
Raylan, I thought she'd tell you herself.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.368
Tim know?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.122
Rachel?

38:53.915 --> 38:54.999
Fantastic.

38:55.083 --> 38:57.126
Well, now we need to talk about
something awkward.

38:57.252 --> 38:59.962
More awkward
than what we just talked about?

39:00.922 --> 39:04.425
Remember that bill
that popped a couple months ago?

39:04.884 --> 39:06.385
Are you joking?

39:06.803 --> 39:09.096
Treasury called this morning.
Another one popped.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.809
- Where?
- El Paso.

39:17.063 --> 39:18.272
El Paso.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.610
Well, has anyone talked to Charlie,
ask him to take a second look?

39:23.695 --> 39:26.780
No. Charlie went home sick Tuesday,

39:27.115 --> 39:28.866
and I haven't been able
to get in touch with him.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.285
Well, I saw Charlie Tuesday. He seemed fine.

39:32.704 --> 39:33.829
Did he, now?

39:45.842 --> 39:46.967
Where you heading?

39:47.802 --> 39:49.928
Wherever the road takes me.

39:50.722 --> 39:54.516
It's first day of retirement.
First day of the rest of my life.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.437
Identification, please.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.661
You be careful.

40:17.290 --> 40:20.793
This is dangerous country, amigo,
filled with desperate men.
