WEBVTT

00:01.352 --> 00:02.267
[August]<i> previously on</i>
<i> the</i> kings of napa.

00:02.353 --> 00:03.519
Why did you lie?

00:03.604 --> 00:05.487
-I work here too,
aunt vanessa.
-Not anymore.

00:05.573 --> 00:07.322
[vanessa]<i> they're moving your</i>
<i> stuff out of your room.</i>

00:07.408 --> 00:09.108
This is what happens to
little wenches who knew

00:09.193 --> 00:11.160
<i> my husband was sleeping</i>
<i> with my sister.</i>

00:11.245 --> 00:14.913
I never told anyone
about how you wanted
to abort dana.

00:15.032 --> 00:16.448
We're being extorted.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.668
I have list of three suspects
who could've been
extorting your father.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.286
We made a deal
to work together.

00:21.372 --> 00:22.921
<i> And then, you go and hire</i>
<i> another winemaker?</i>

00:23.040 --> 00:24.423
My vote's going to August.

00:24.542 --> 00:26.341
This is not how our family
does things.

00:26.427 --> 00:29.545
I'm bringing August down
by any means necessary.

00:35.219 --> 00:36.969
Kid finished the top
of his class,

00:37.054 --> 00:39.805
harvard undergrad,
wharton mba.

00:39.890 --> 00:42.224
-And he's, you know...
-Black. [chuckles]

00:42.309 --> 00:43.892
check, check and double check.

00:43.978 --> 00:47.730
Listen, I don't wanna get in
a dogfight with hsbc.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.231
Let's make him an offer.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.620
[door opens]

00:54.739 --> 00:56.789
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

00:57.908 --> 01:00.292
oh, so you're dana king.

01:08.636 --> 01:11.804
[melanie] it was nice of them
to make your favorite sandwich
off menu.

01:11.922 --> 01:12.888
Yep.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.424
Spicy italian calabrian
chili aioli should be

01:15.509 --> 01:18.010
on everyone's
top ten favorite meals.

01:18.095 --> 01:20.262
Your metabolism kills me.

01:20.347 --> 01:24.566
-Mmm-mmm. Don't hate the
player, hate the workout game.
-Okay.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.436
Look, I know it's been a while
since we sat here together but

01:27.521 --> 01:29.772
I really appreciate you having
lunch with me.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.573
Considering everything.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.827
Do you know when you were
too nervous to ask
rebecca johnson out,

01:34.945 --> 01:36.278
who gave you a pep talk?

01:36.781 --> 01:37.830
I was a kid.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.665
It's different now.

01:39.784 --> 01:42.367
Well, things have always
been different for us,
haven't they?

01:42.453 --> 01:44.620
We've always been outsiders
of our own families.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.456
Hell, dickens could've written
a whole novel just about us.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.459
Did your sister win
all the prizes and your mom
try to abort you?

01:51.846 --> 01:53.762
It's just a wine, dana.

01:53.848 --> 01:55.964
Don't worry about your sister.

01:56.050 --> 01:58.884
And yvette didn't mean
that your mother wanted
to abort you,

01:58.969 --> 02:02.187
she was just mad that vanessa
threw her out of her palace.

02:02.273 --> 02:04.573
-Your parents loved you.
-Loved me?

02:05.326 --> 02:07.192
I don't wanna talk about this.

02:07.278 --> 02:10.746
Honey, this family wouldn't
be perfect without you.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.282
I see you.

02:13.367 --> 02:16.585
And I know exactly how
we can get you the respect
you deserve.

02:18.289 --> 02:19.505
What do you have
in mind, auntie?

02:21.175 --> 02:24.459
To finally landing on
our choice of dessert wine

02:24.545 --> 02:26.712
and our amazing winemaker.

02:27.631 --> 02:28.630
Cheers.

02:30.100 --> 02:31.633
Congratulations, honey.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.718
Thank you, mama.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.305
Mm.

02:37.441 --> 02:39.341
Okay. So...

02:39.443 --> 02:41.676
We're on our way to creating
something really special,

02:41.779 --> 02:43.612
but we've gotta keep
on our grind.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.397
Yeah, let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

02:45.482 --> 02:48.450
We still have to harvest,
ferment and sample
the new blend.

02:48.536 --> 02:52.020
Get it trademarked,
sign a label and set up
a tasting for the critics.

02:52.122 --> 02:54.239
Has anyone thought about
a name for it?

02:54.325 --> 02:56.191
How about we name it
after a baddie.

02:56.293 --> 02:58.827
-Make it sexy like,
"black china".
-No.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.862
[christian] cardi,
some stripper from atlanta.

03:00.965 --> 03:02.697
It will be a big hit with
the ballers.

03:02.800 --> 03:04.333
They buy a lot of high end
grapes in strip clubs.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.084
Yeah. It's great.

03:06.170 --> 03:08.470
-[chuckling]
-you gotta give the people
what they need.

03:08.556 --> 03:11.173
What you fogies want isn't
what the cool peeps want.

03:11.258 --> 03:14.843
What I don't want
is a wine that's served in
red solo cups.

03:14.929 --> 03:17.012
[chuckling] I hear that.

03:17.097 --> 03:20.148
[gasps] how about
"late night"?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.516
What are we, a talk-show now?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.685
Why don't you stick to
selling wigs?

03:23.771 --> 03:26.355
-I still work here.
-Well, thank god you don't
live here.

03:27.775 --> 03:30.993
Okay, all right, ladies.
Even germany took down
the wall.

03:31.078 --> 03:33.728
How about the name
"king's heritage"?

03:33.831 --> 03:37.065
It's a saint, it embodies
our whole family,
including our ancestors

03:37.167 --> 03:39.534
and future generations.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.569
And it's a great tribute
to dad.

03:41.672 --> 03:43.205
We are everything
he left behind.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.841
[dana imitating horns]
pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!

03:45.926 --> 03:48.576
-Dana, that suit.
-Mm-hm.

03:48.679 --> 03:52.681
You're looking at one of
<i> asset makers'</i> top 40 cfo's
under 40.

03:52.766 --> 03:57.469
Auntie melanie has a writer
friend who's looking for
black excellence and thought,

03:57.554 --> 03:59.104
since I personify it,

03:59.723 --> 04:01.857
why not get me?

04:01.942 --> 04:04.643
Dana, you are the top of
every list in my book, honey,

04:04.728 --> 04:06.895
-but you can't trust melanie.
-[dana] sure, I can.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.063
At least she supports me.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.431
Unlike you judases.

04:10.234 --> 04:11.900
-I voted for you, dana.
-[dana] hm.

04:11.986 --> 04:13.702
Odd, because you wanted
to abort me.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.103
-Anyway...
-Oh, lord.

04:15.205 --> 04:18.273
[dana] the<i> asset makers</i>
crew is coming here to do
my interview

04:18.375 --> 04:20.042
and photoshoot in a few days.

04:20.127 --> 04:23.412
So, I need you to turn into
a tinder date and ghost.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.914
Come bro, I got you.
I'mma be your hype man.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.501
No thanks.<i> Asset makers</i>
knows my worth.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.672
Damn. He doesn't lose easily.

04:33.757 --> 04:36.458
Ain't nothing gonna get done
if dana's not on board.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.728
I know. I'm working on
something for him. Trust.

04:42.099 --> 04:44.099
[theme song playing]

05:17.885 --> 05:21.669
dana, picked up one of those
bouchon croissants you love.

05:21.772 --> 05:26.341
And your oat milk latte
piping hot.

05:26.443 --> 05:28.560
Maybe I need a tester.
How can I trust this?

05:30.230 --> 05:31.363
I'm just proud of you, love.

05:33.400 --> 05:34.816
And this article...

05:35.869 --> 05:37.402
This is a prestige get.

05:39.990 --> 05:42.407
You've always deserved
this kind of publicity.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.127
If you're busy,

05:45.212 --> 05:47.996
I can give you a special
little treat later.

05:51.719 --> 05:55.837
For the millionth time,
I'm really sorry I voted
for August.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.373
But I was thinking about
our family.

05:58.475 --> 06:02.177
I must also apologize
because it seems like my back
hurt your knife.

06:02.262 --> 06:04.712
Dana, you're blowing this
out of proportion.

06:04.815 --> 06:08.266
You know I was trying to stage
a coup, you chopped my legs
off at the knees.

06:08.352 --> 06:10.218
When you did that pr campaign
with the lee's,

06:10.320 --> 06:11.987
everybody hated,
I had your back.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.356
When you did that proposal
for that overpriced
bed and breakfast,

06:14.441 --> 06:17.075
that was gonna take up
five acres of our land,

06:17.861 --> 06:19.745
I was your rock in the storm.

06:20.831 --> 06:22.831
I didn't know we were
keeping score.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.416
Well, now, you do.

06:24.535 --> 06:28.203
I mean, we have your little
wine club's paint and sip
happening this week.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.789
Did I ever complain about it?
No.

06:30.874 --> 06:32.374
I helped you sell it
to my mother.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.021
Dana?

06:46.106 --> 06:48.807
I spoke to quincy,
he says that he doesn't
think dad's...

06:48.892 --> 06:50.859
Patient's family is behind
the extortion.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.146
They all moved to austin
a year ago. So, he said
he's gonna keep digging and

06:55.199 --> 06:56.731
gets back to us when
he finds something.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.984
Hey, are you all right?

06:59.069 --> 07:01.369
Still working on
the dessert wine budget.

07:01.455 --> 07:02.704
Can you just give me
some space?

07:02.790 --> 07:06.541
Listen, I know you're still
upset about what
aunt yvette said.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.611
I've been trying to talk to
you about it this whole week.

07:09.713 --> 07:13.415
Come on, you gotta
open up sometime,
I'm your sister.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.667
Not sure playing
the "sister" card is the win
that you think it is.

07:15.752 --> 07:17.118
Especially after
the other night.

07:17.221 --> 07:21.122
Funny how bridgette
is your sister but she
stabbed you in the back.

07:21.225 --> 07:23.225
Or was it the other
way around? Hm?

07:23.310 --> 07:25.960
All right, I'm gonna
let this slide
because I know this is just

07:26.063 --> 07:27.679
what you do when
you're pissed off.

07:27.764 --> 07:31.299
But even though we don't
always see eye to eye,
I am here for you, dana.

07:31.401 --> 07:33.602
I know you think that's true,
but it's not.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.154
-In this family,
I'm on my own island.
-Dana.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.140
-I'm trying here.
-Fine.

07:39.243 --> 07:41.943
I'll fire the winemaker.
I accept your semi-apology.
Now go.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.778
[cellphone rings]

07:47.618 --> 07:49.117
[dana] what?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.369
Have you landed on what you
want me to do about
this dirt on your sis?

07:51.455 --> 07:53.038
I'll use it when
the time is right.

07:53.123 --> 07:56.458
Like sun tzu said,
"he will win
who knows when to fight."

07:56.543 --> 07:59.827
he also says,
"he who gained victory
will suffer a defeat."

07:59.930 --> 08:00.929
[dana]<i> that's not the point.</i>

08:01.014 --> 08:03.849
Quincy. Whatever. [sighs]

08:06.136 --> 08:08.887
well, since it's your
first day, we wanna give you
the grand tour

08:08.972 --> 08:10.472
and show you where
everything is.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.140
I appreciate that.

08:13.277 --> 08:15.477
How often do you guys
trim your vines?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.729
They're looking a little...
Weedy.

08:17.814 --> 08:20.448
We've have grounds workers
who take care of that.

08:20.534 --> 08:22.350
Oh, I don't mind getting
my hands dirty.

08:22.452 --> 08:24.786
And being tactile helps me get
to know the product.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.988
-Our product's excellent.
-I'm not saying it isn't.

08:27.074 --> 08:29.074
Okay. Okay.

08:29.159 --> 08:31.293
You go show her around
and I'll take care of
the other thing.

08:31.378 --> 08:32.794
[shawn] okay.
But just calm down.

08:32.880 --> 08:35.747
-You know, everything
will be fine.
-Well, you don't know that.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.868
-Did I say something wrong?
-No, it's not you.

08:40.971 --> 08:43.755
It's just, we're dealing with
a little problem.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.257
That's all. But it'll be fine.

08:45.342 --> 08:49.210
Why don't you finish
looking around
and I'll check on him.

08:49.313 --> 08:50.262
Okay?

08:52.266 --> 08:54.432
[both laughing]

08:54.518 --> 08:55.734
got you. Got you.

08:58.488 --> 09:00.221
-Ooh!
-There we go.

09:00.324 --> 09:03.391
I cannot believe your ass
owns this place.

09:03.493 --> 09:05.110
I cannot believe your ass.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.196
Sheila, you are finer...

09:08.282 --> 09:09.998
[both moan softly]

09:10.083 --> 09:12.334
than a bottle of
vintage grand cru.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.587
Now I know how you buying
all those magnums at the club.

09:16.290 --> 09:17.505
You eight figure rich.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.040
Word hard, play harder.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.410
I got a whole team
but I take care of these
grapes myself.

09:22.512 --> 09:23.678
They do look tasty.

09:24.464 --> 09:25.714
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:29.052 --> 09:30.135
[sheila] ah!

09:32.222 --> 09:34.139
Mm.

09:34.224 --> 09:35.890
-It's good, right?
-That is so good. [chuckles]

09:35.976 --> 09:38.193
-it'll make an even
between wine.
-Hm.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.729
Almost as juicy as you are.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.197
[otis clears throat]

09:42.282 --> 09:44.649
can you please stop trampling
all over the vines
with your yeezys?

09:44.735 --> 09:46.768
Chill. I'm just showing
my girl around.

09:46.870 --> 09:48.119
We trying to work here,
christian.

09:54.411 --> 09:56.411
I do not like the way
he talked to you.

09:56.496 --> 09:57.445
It's fine, babe.

09:57.547 --> 09:58.546
He knows I'm the boss.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.750
Hold on a second.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.302
Gotta check these vines.
They're looking kind of dry.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.424
[phone ringing]

10:12.512 --> 10:15.563
I want motion sensors
all over the property.

10:15.649 --> 10:18.016
In front, out back,
everywhere.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.967
Once we're done, not even
covid can get in here.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.236
What's up?

10:21.321 --> 10:25.573
Uh, we're just worried about
the coyotes and deer.

10:25.659 --> 10:28.410
Oh, well most people just
use strobe lights
and roller guards.

10:30.364 --> 10:31.613
Look, we don't have time
for that.

10:31.698 --> 10:33.581
Some crazy person
is after us for money.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.084
We're getting threatening
calls like we're in some
horror movie.

10:36.169 --> 10:37.652
I'm thinking about
buying a gun.

10:37.754 --> 10:40.205
Can you see me holding a gun?
I can barely handle
a remote control.

10:40.290 --> 10:43.124
They want $150,000.
It's gonna bankrupt us.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.343
Wait, wait.
Are you guys getting
extorted too?

10:51.902 --> 10:55.103
This is wonderful, dana.
Our readership is
going to love you.

10:55.205 --> 10:57.372
No doubt. Cover.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.125
You are doing great, sweetie.
Why don't you wear that
other jacket that I like?

11:00.243 --> 11:02.711
With these pants?
That's just tacky.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.880
Also, I wanted to thank you
for the vote.

11:05.966 --> 11:08.950
And stepping up. I know things
can't be easy with dana

11:09.052 --> 11:11.052
after voting against him
on the dessert wine.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.138
He's locked me out
of our bedroom.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.007
He pretty much shut me
out too.

11:16.093 --> 11:19.594
It's like we're kids
and he's mad I stole his
calculator or something.

11:20.263 --> 11:21.813
I wanna bring him in
on some things,

11:21.932 --> 11:23.798
I know the launch isn't
for a while but maybe we could

11:23.900 --> 11:25.517
bring him into
the marketing campaign

11:25.602 --> 11:27.736
and show him his opinions
still count.

11:27.821 --> 11:30.238
[rose] well, we need to hurry
and make up

11:30.323 --> 11:32.991
because this rose garden
needs tending.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.659
Dana.

11:34.778 --> 11:36.995
You should really try on
the other jacket.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.312
It makes you look regal.

11:38.415 --> 11:39.647
Good eye, auntie.

11:39.750 --> 11:42.167
You have impeccable taste.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.003
[scoffs] I swear melanie
orchestrated this whole thing

11:45.122 --> 11:46.871
just to drive a wedge
between us.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.841
He had no business
inviting her here
during my tour.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.995
Especially, since I found out
she'd been sneaking over
to yvette's to see my husband.

11:54.097 --> 11:55.496
[man] how about
we change it up?

11:55.599 --> 11:57.716
Sometimes we would like
to show the important people
in your life.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.051
Maybe a power couple picture
with your wife.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.169
Or a mother-son thing.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.188
-That sounds like
a lovely idea.
-See?

12:04.474 --> 12:05.506
Or my aunt melanie.

12:05.609 --> 12:07.559
She helped make me
the man I am today.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.027
-Melanie?
-Dana, no.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.446
I know you're upset about
your aunt yvette's
off the cuff remark,

12:11.531 --> 12:14.365
-but I am still your mother
and this is my home.
-[dana scoffs]

12:14.484 --> 12:17.351
come on, aunt melanie.
<i> Asset makers</i> readership
is worldwide.

12:17.454 --> 12:20.872
You're an international
working woman.
Not some random housewife.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.791
Young girls need
to be inspired.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.125
You look good in this red.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.161
Anthony, get her best side.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.964
Why are you here?

12:30.050 --> 12:31.699
Did your mama invite you?

12:31.802 --> 12:34.636
-I need to talk to August.
-About how you voted for dana
against the dessert wine?

12:34.721 --> 12:36.254
No one's thinking about that
right now.

12:36.339 --> 12:38.389
You should be thinking
about my boundaries.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.142
You and your mother
are not supposed to be back
in this house.

12:41.228 --> 12:42.727
That's fine.

12:42.846 --> 12:46.714
We'll just let
the extortionist poison your
vines and ruin your paradise,

12:46.817 --> 12:48.983
just like they're planning
to do with shawn and shawn.

12:49.069 --> 12:50.769
Extortionist, what are you
talking about?

12:50.854 --> 12:52.604
Wait, did she forget
to tell you?

12:52.689 --> 12:56.274
That's right because
you're worried about
her falling apart.

12:56.359 --> 12:59.611
-August!
-Mom. You know, I can explain.
Just...

12:59.696 --> 13:01.780
Excuse me, can we wrap
this up tomorrow?

13:01.865 --> 13:03.331
Oh, well, that would be great.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.617
-Maybe we can get
the whole family.
-Sounds wonderfu--

13:05.702 --> 13:07.919
no. Let's finish now.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.238
-We have good light.
-Dana, no one cares
about the light.

13:10.340 --> 13:11.589
Come on, we have an emergency.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.578
-Mom. Mom!
-An extortionist?

13:17.681 --> 13:20.598
-Someone is threatening
our family?
-We were gonna tell you.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.684
It's not how it looks.
I mean, it is how it looks.

13:22.769 --> 13:23.885
-But...
-[shrieks]

13:25.055 --> 13:27.605
mom. We didn't mean
to hurt you.

13:27.724 --> 13:30.775
Back off. I will speak to you
when I am ready.

13:39.536 --> 13:40.785
[door opens]

13:52.799 --> 13:54.799
mom, did you see
the wine club?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.084
They're here for
the paint and sip.

13:56.803 --> 13:57.886
[vanessa] hm.

13:59.923 --> 14:02.957
Thanks to bridgette,
I know your little secret.

14:03.059 --> 14:06.127
How long has this extortion
thing been going on,
and don't lie to me.

14:06.229 --> 14:07.795
I got a call a few weeks ago.

14:07.898 --> 14:11.966
After the ceremony,
we dropped off $150,000
at the bridge on holtmann.

14:12.068 --> 14:14.986
You left your
father's ceremony
to drop money off in a park.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.906
So, this whole scholarship
story was a bunch of malarkey?

14:17.991 --> 14:20.158
And the truth is, reggie was
being shaken down.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.492
We're afraid so.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.411
Wait. Wait, hold up.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.314
-We didn't want you to worry.
-I could've helped.

14:26.416 --> 14:28.249
-We were cool.
Bridgette had a gun.
-A gun?

14:28.335 --> 14:33.588
Okay. Wait, so, while y'all
were out playing cops
and robbers with our money,

14:33.673 --> 14:35.840
you had me babysit
ma and aunt yvette?

14:35.959 --> 14:37.926
And we really appreciate it,
christian.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.345
Forget all of that.
Stop trying to breastfeed me.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.930
I'm as much as a king
as you are.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.098
-Will you quit making this
about you?
-Silence!

14:45.018 --> 14:46.718
You all should be ashamed.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.354
You should've come to me
as soon as you got the call.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.389
I'm done with people lying.

14:51.474 --> 14:54.142
First, my husband.
Then, my sister.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.778
Our vines could be destroyed.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.030
Vines I planted with
my own two hands.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.899
The vines are fine right now.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.817
I checked on them
before I came inside.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.203
[vanessa] did you know
about this too, melanie?

15:05.322 --> 15:08.072
-She gave bridgette the gun.
-Oh. Isn't this
a crock of butter.

15:08.158 --> 15:10.458
Wait. What were you doing
with a gun, aunt melanie?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.577
I was robbed once,
in sierra leone.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.213
-I've been carrying one
ever since.
-So, help me god.

15:15.332 --> 15:17.131
Mom, breathe.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.750
[christian] I called you
five times.

15:18.835 --> 15:22.387
You left me out of
the money drop, the least
you can do is call me back.

15:22.505 --> 15:23.588
Are you serious with this
right now?

15:23.673 --> 15:26.557
-I really need your help
with those vines.
-Later.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.226
I mean, look at
the bright side, mom. Right?

15:28.345 --> 15:30.645
At least bridgette told us
about shawn and shawn.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.765
I would never keep that kind
of info away from you guys.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.216
Of course, you wouldn't,
bridge.

15:35.318 --> 15:36.567
You know I wanted you
back here.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.219
But August has been
kowtowing to mom.

15:38.321 --> 15:40.388
-That is not
how it went down.
-Sure, it was.

15:40.490 --> 15:42.190
We're lying now? Great.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.276
Quincy.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.912
Y'all share a groundskeeper
with shawn and shawn.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.563
-Otis, right?
-Yeah.

15:49.666 --> 15:52.917
The workers told me he got
into an argument with your dad

15:53.036 --> 15:54.619
about making
the vineyards cleaner.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.921
He did. I heard it.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.873
Why would that concern you?
You're security.

16:02.212 --> 16:04.262
Or, are you security?

16:04.381 --> 16:05.797
He's our pi.

16:05.882 --> 16:08.582
-We have a pi?
-Ain't this a bitch.

16:08.685 --> 16:12.770
You're a pi. I knew something
was up with all of
your questions.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.973
Christian, how has otis been
out in the vines?

16:15.058 --> 16:17.358
Riding me like a mule
in the dirty south.

16:17.444 --> 16:20.611
I installed spyware on his
computer and found this
at his house.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.865
-What's that?
-[quincy] he bought
an $80,000 boat.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.767
I guess otis is trying to turn
grapes into gold.

16:26.870 --> 16:29.620
-When did he purchase that?
-Three months ago.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.773
I don't know, y'all.

16:32.876 --> 16:35.710
He might be a hardass,
but this doesn't seem like
something he would do.

16:35.795 --> 16:38.379
Maybe somebody
in his family died
and they gave him some dough.

16:38.465 --> 16:42.050
I mean, aunt melanie got
$15 million from
the settlement

16:42.135 --> 16:43.718
for dropping the dime
on that doctor she worked for

16:43.803 --> 16:45.970
that was getting
kickbacks from
the pharmaceutical company.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.139
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

16:48.258 --> 16:51.225
We should have the police
pick up otis before he causes
some real damage.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.462
We should have
a conversation with him first
and keep this quiet.

16:54.564 --> 16:55.430
No.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.733
No more secrets.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.685
Secrets got my husband killed.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.738
We need to figure this out
before it kills
the rest of us.

17:07.477 --> 17:08.843
[shawn] I can't believe this.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.845
Is it because we didn't
give otis that raise that
he asked for?

17:10.947 --> 17:11.996
Let's call the cops.

17:12.098 --> 17:14.816
Let's let our pi
do a little more recon first.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.452
But our payment is
due tomorrow.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.287
You need to relax.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.306
-You don't wanna show
your cards just yet.
-She's right.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.492
Let's make sure it's
otis on the footage.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.527
Let's see how he acts
after you don't pay.

17:26.629 --> 17:28.362
Then, we can move in.

17:28.465 --> 17:31.031
-I don't know. I don't know.
-How could this happen?

17:31.134 --> 17:34.469
We trusted him with
our property when we
went to Italy.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.753
I don't get it.

17:35.839 --> 17:38.306
He's probably bluffing.
No one is poisoning
our vines.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.259
Look, shawn, I understand
how you feel.

17:41.344 --> 17:44.095
My dad was paying for
otis' wife's chemo treatments.

17:44.180 --> 17:47.682
We thought he was family.
But let's let our man
do his thing first.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.150
[shawn] okay, fine.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.486
It'll be better than us
drawing from our credit line.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.854
Let us know what you find.

17:52.939 --> 17:54.272
-Of course.
-Let's go.

17:58.661 --> 18:00.194
August, we've gotta call
the fbi.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.030
This isn't some small time
piddly mess with the napa pd.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.066
Dana's right. If it is otis,
he could poison the vines
at any time.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.403
-Let's give quincy one more
night to get more evidence.
-What are you afraid of?

18:09.506 --> 18:12.239
I spoke to otis and my gut
says it isn't him.

18:12.342 --> 18:16.677
I am not calling a bunch of
cops on a black man
unless we are sure.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.047
Besides, how do we know
dad wasn't getting shaken down
because the extortionist

18:20.133 --> 18:22.082
knew he was involved in
something messed up?

18:22.185 --> 18:23.751
That could destroy
the whole family.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.553
They're after shawn
and shawn too.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.922
Well, maybe they're involved
in something messed up too.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.391
Why this is happening
should be the question.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.527
I mean, let's not pretend
we knew everything about
our dad.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.813
He had more secrets than
a freaking zane novel.

18:35.899 --> 18:37.865
-She's got a point there.
-Whose side are you on?

18:37.951 --> 18:41.602
-Dana, I'm just trying to do
my job.
-So was julius caesar.

18:41.704 --> 18:42.820
Look at where it got him.

18:48.411 --> 18:50.411
Y'all's dam is about to break.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.164
Your management style
doesn't work with his.

18:53.249 --> 18:54.582
You need to rein him in.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.085
I've got a mother who's
grieving because she lost
her husband.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.754
And I have a brother
who's mourning

18:59.839 --> 19:01.789
because he feels like
he lost his standing.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.891
And you can't let him
undermine you.

19:18.024 --> 19:19.907
[crying] dad what were you
involved in?

19:23.780 --> 19:24.745
[sighs]

19:29.252 --> 19:32.286
-[line ringing]
-[cellphone ringing]

19:33.173 --> 19:34.372
hold on, hold on.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.427
August, hey.
I'm a little busy right now.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.461
<i> Can I hit you back?</i>

19:41.347 --> 19:43.431
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.433
Are you okay?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.185
[August]<i> yeah, I'm fine. Um...</i>

19:48.388 --> 19:50.054
You just call me back
when you can, okay?

20:10.877 --> 20:13.211
[gasps] she's still wearing
the wedding ring.

20:18.585 --> 20:21.869
Look at my big sis
pulling through for
her little bro.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.504
Bring it down a notch.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.972
I'm here because I love
the grapes.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.925
And if some assholes try
to hurt them,
I need you to be on top of it.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.679
And what is this getup?

20:31.764 --> 20:33.380
This is balenciaga.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.266
Don't be mad at
the drip, baby.

20:35.351 --> 20:38.218
-It's all about the drip.
-It's all about the grapes.

20:38.321 --> 20:40.321
That's why the guys in
the fields are clowning you.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.556
Whoa, whoa. How do you
know about that?

20:42.659 --> 20:44.325
[bridgette] people talk,
christian.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.444
Dress the part and respect
the vines.

20:46.529 --> 20:48.496
These guys bust their butts
out there.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.564
Okay. The harvest.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.033
Sounds basic but it's not.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.702
This fruit can be
temperamental which is why
we harvest at night,

20:54.787 --> 20:56.737
when the sugar levels
are more stable.

20:56.839 --> 20:59.624
So, then we use
the refractometer?

20:59.709 --> 21:01.509
So, the refractometer's
just one tool.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.629
We also need to evaluate
the color of the grapes
and their stems.

21:04.714 --> 21:08.015
Come on. I'll show you how
things work in
the production facility.

21:15.525 --> 21:17.875
[dana]<i> asset makers</i> should
love this.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.644
[camera shutter clicking]

21:20.897 --> 21:23.314
um, all right. How about you
maybe stand in front.

21:23.399 --> 21:25.099
-There we go.
-I'm sorry.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.867
Sorry, I just need a sec.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.653
Oh, it's okay.

21:28.738 --> 21:31.038
-Let's take some solos.
-Yeah, yeah. Just, you know?

21:39.799 --> 21:43.951
She's probably bloated
from all that salt
she's been eating.

21:44.053 --> 21:47.287
[lisa] thank you all for
sitting down with me again,
to finish the interview.

21:47.390 --> 21:51.092
-So, tell me about
your relationship with dana.
-[cellphone vibrates]

21:51.177 --> 21:53.460
[vanessa] my son.
My sweet son.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.430
You oaky, girl? You look damp.

21:56.516 --> 21:59.400
-Oh, yeah, I'm fine.
Just too much sun.
-[vanessa clears throat]

21:59.485 --> 22:01.686
August and christian were so
lucky to grow up with

22:01.771 --> 22:03.571
a focused older brother
like dana.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.023
-You know, he kept
them grounded.
-And on their toes.

22:06.109 --> 22:09.577
-I got a 1600 on my sats.
-[all chuckle]

22:09.662 --> 22:12.079
[lisa] and so, what was it
like for you, August,

22:12.165 --> 22:14.949
being the only girl
in a household of king boys?

22:15.034 --> 22:18.318
Oh, well my cousin bridgette
was around a lot.

22:18.421 --> 22:19.987
So it was like having
a sister.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.790
[chuckles] and christian,

22:22.875 --> 22:26.326
-what did you like to do
for fun?
-Oh, we are skin tight.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.162
Dana and I, we got
a pickup game in every week.

22:28.264 --> 22:30.715
-I even let him win sometimes.
-[all chuckle]

22:30.800 --> 22:33.384
is that what you tell yourself
to heal your broken ankles?

22:33.469 --> 22:35.970
Bro, that was one time.
Right, August?

22:36.055 --> 22:39.006
-Oh, don't drag me into
the middle of this.
-[awkward chuckles]

22:39.108 --> 22:40.391
let's keep it cute, y'all.

22:40.476 --> 22:43.060
Uh, who are you to tell
my children what to do?

22:43.146 --> 22:46.680
Oh, watch out.
Cersei's about to kick my butt
back to the curb.

22:46.783 --> 22:50.017
[laughs awkwardly]
would you mind
giving us a minute?

22:50.119 --> 22:52.653
Ignore her.
This is my interview.

22:52.739 --> 22:55.956
Keep the questions
coming, lisa.
Today is about me

22:56.042 --> 22:59.076
and the politics of managing
the financials of this
epic company.

22:59.162 --> 23:03.330
-Oh, because you've been
doing that so well lately.
-[vanessa chuckles]

23:04.584 --> 23:07.134
tell you what,
how about we take five?

23:14.177 --> 23:16.594
First, you steamroll me
on the extortion

23:16.679 --> 23:18.763
by refusing to have
otis arrested.

23:18.848 --> 23:21.715
And then you turn my interview
into the circus maximus.

23:21.818 --> 23:25.986
Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want us
to look like a bunch of fools
in front of this reporter?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.321
You don't respect me.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.606
You don't respect
my accomplishments.

23:28.691 --> 23:29.890
I am the oldest.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.059
Actually, bridgette is
the oldest.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.779
-Maybe you have
middle-child syndrome.
-Don't diagnose me.

23:34.864 --> 23:37.364
It's okay, dana.
I'm a middle kid.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.949
Look how I turned out.

23:39.035 --> 23:41.786
-I think what dana's trying
to say is that--
-oh, save it.

23:41.871 --> 23:44.338
The only reason you've
arranged this interview
for dana

23:44.424 --> 23:45.456
was to get back at me.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.208
-Oh, that is not true.
-[scoffs]

23:47.293 --> 23:50.211
you know, I could use a drink.
Can anyone else use a drink?

23:50.296 --> 23:53.013
Yes, you have always been
jealous of me,
even when we were kids.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.682
Oh, bullshit.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.468
Yeah, always trying to one up
and now you're trying to
get between me and my son.

23:57.553 --> 23:59.920
You just can't believe
<i> asset makers</i> chose me.

24:00.022 --> 24:02.690
-No, honey. That's not
what I meant.
-[dana] sure it is.

24:02.775 --> 24:04.859
That's why a few years ago,
when your friends hooked me up

24:04.944 --> 24:06.477
with that cambridge sloan
interview,

24:06.562 --> 24:08.312
you never told them
I was a little person.

24:08.397 --> 24:11.365
'cause you knew I wouldn't get
hired and I'd be forced
to come back here

24:11.451 --> 24:12.817
and work for
the family business.

24:12.902 --> 24:16.203
-Oh, dana,
that's ridiculous, honey.
-Or it's spot on.

24:16.289 --> 24:18.539
And you're a manipulative mom
who thinks she's
sir thomas beecham

24:18.624 --> 24:20.274
and we're just the orchestra
in your little pit.

24:20.376 --> 24:22.409
-And you're conducting
our every move.
-Dana!

24:22.495 --> 24:24.912
Maybe you're behind
the extortion.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.714
And this is some wild plot
to get back at dad.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.615
-Oh! Oh.
-Dana, you take that back.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.785
I'm sorry. I have another
interview scheduled,
but you know what?

24:31.888 --> 24:33.003
[beeps]

24:33.089 --> 24:34.288
we've got plenty.

24:34.390 --> 24:37.457
Uh, wait a minute.
Was that on the whole time?

24:37.560 --> 24:38.792
Yeah, we like to
keep recording.

24:38.895 --> 24:41.395
Uh, you need to erase those
last five minutes.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.797
This recording is now property
of<i> asset makers.</i>

24:43.900 --> 24:46.800
Sweetheart, do you have
cotton in your ears?
This isn't a request.

24:46.903 --> 24:49.353
Yeah. We're not
playing around.
Give over the goddamn tape.

24:49.438 --> 24:51.989
No can do. We'll be in touch.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.611
Y'all just gonna let her
walk past you?

24:58.781 --> 25:00.664
[indistinct shouting]

25:06.572 --> 25:08.239
[vanessa] okay, everyone.
I need you guys to dig deep

25:08.324 --> 25:10.641
and paint what you feel.

25:10.743 --> 25:13.327
If it's happiness, then let's
see it on the canvas.

25:13.446 --> 25:16.813
If it is joy, then let me see
that canvas burst with energy.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.866
Nice. Nice.

25:18.951 --> 25:22.369
Coming up next is our famous
house of kings chardonnay

25:22.455 --> 25:24.421
as part of our next flight.
So...

25:24.507 --> 25:27.324
Cleanse those palates,
it's time to get our drink on.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.842
[woman laughing]

25:28.961 --> 25:31.128
hi. Can I talk to you
for a sec?

25:36.352 --> 25:39.103
Hell, no. I don't wanna see
any more of your
sorry face today.

25:39.188 --> 25:41.338
You were right.
I have been jealous
of you.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.839
Since we were kids.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.509
Isn't there an uprising
somewhere in the world
you need to tend to?

25:45.611 --> 25:49.897
But I also know how it feels
to be on the outside of
your own family.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.899
To live in your
sister's shadow.

25:51.984 --> 25:55.369
You were the star
of every school play.
Homecoming queen.

25:55.488 --> 25:57.071
No one even knew who I was.

25:57.156 --> 26:01.709
And if they did, they knew me
as beautiful, slim, vanessa's
chubby kid sister.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.161
I am not gonna apologize
for who I am, melanie.

26:05.131 --> 26:06.297
I lived my whole life

26:07.166 --> 26:08.415
wanting to be you.

26:08.501 --> 26:11.719
But I am not using dana
to retaliate.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.972
I actually care about
all of you. And...

26:16.509 --> 26:17.841
I cared about reginald.

26:19.478 --> 26:21.478
Do you hear how that sounds?

26:21.564 --> 26:24.848
You shared secrets,
you cared about my husband.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.736
Vanessa, I can't tell you
how sorry I am

26:28.854 --> 26:31.221
about this whole situation.

26:31.324 --> 26:33.907
You were always a jealous,
manipulative child

26:34.026 --> 26:38.662
and now you've tweaked your
skills into an opportunist
who does whatever she wants.

26:38.748 --> 26:40.247
Reginald was mine.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.566
What else aren't you
telling me?

26:42.668 --> 26:44.501
What else do you know
about the debt?

26:44.587 --> 26:46.453
The deranged person squeezing
us for money,

26:46.539 --> 26:50.007
or do you just enjoy
watching my family
twist in the wind?

26:50.092 --> 26:53.761
I swear to god, if you're
hiding more secrets,
melanie octavia pierce,

26:53.879 --> 26:55.078
I will kill you.

26:55.181 --> 26:57.381
Do you hear me?
I will destroy you.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.090
We talked.

27:07.193 --> 27:10.361
Once a week.
About bridgette mostly.

27:10.446 --> 27:13.597
But reginald was afraid
for your lives.

27:13.699 --> 27:15.649
His money situation
made him paranoid.

27:15.735 --> 27:18.435
He thought you were in
real danger.

27:18.537 --> 27:21.372
He even had a plan
to escape the country
with you and the kids

27:21.457 --> 27:23.607
-in the middle of the night.
-Oh, here you go.

27:23.709 --> 27:25.793
Have you checked his
cigar boxes

27:25.911 --> 27:28.128
what are you doing?
Humidifying more lies?

27:28.247 --> 27:29.797
Go see for yourself, vanessa.

27:29.915 --> 27:31.632
This is not a game.

27:40.926 --> 27:41.892
[August] mom?

27:43.262 --> 27:44.561
What do you need?

27:44.647 --> 27:45.896
Mom, tell me what you need.

27:47.433 --> 27:49.016
What are you looking for?

27:49.101 --> 27:52.636
-Mom. What are you
looking for?
-There's something in here.

27:52.738 --> 27:55.406
Okay. Mom, you're scaring me.
You need...

27:56.826 --> 27:59.276
You son of a bitch.

28:04.450 --> 28:06.316
[panting]

28:06.419 --> 28:09.920
mom, dad has a passport
with your name
as victoria williams.

28:10.005 --> 28:11.988
-These are fakes.
-My god.

28:12.091 --> 28:14.458
-Money.
-Wait, how did you know
about this?

28:14.794 --> 28:15.759
Melanie.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.646
<i> ♪ I don't catch feelings</i>
<i> I catch flights ♪</i>

28:20.649 --> 28:24.334
-I can't believe your dad had
passports and hidden money.
-Hm.

28:24.437 --> 28:27.337
Do you two have a plan
for this homeland issue
your daddy left behind?

28:27.440 --> 28:29.773
You know, maddi, if you could
just keep it on the low.

28:29.859 --> 28:31.975
Two more weeks and you gotta
pay this person in.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.895
Have you talked to kelvin
about it yet?

28:34.980 --> 28:38.282
I'm sure he's had other
shady-ass clients dealing
with blackmail threats before.

28:38.367 --> 28:41.034
Kelvin's a good guy.
He deserves to know what kind
of mess he's in for.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.404
I don't really know what's
going on with kelvin

28:43.489 --> 28:46.857
'cause I keep trying to make
a move on him and he keeps
giving me the hug.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.460
-Oof! Not the hug.
-Yeah.

28:49.545 --> 28:53.130
-Have you checked the ex?
-Well, he is still wearing
his wedding ring.

28:53.215 --> 28:55.582
-And so is she.
-[grunts]

28:55.668 --> 28:57.217
well, maybe you need to start
boiling bunnies.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.169
[laughing] girl, no.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.305
But real talk, though.

29:01.390 --> 29:03.640
I mean, do we even feel like
brothers can be faithful?

29:03.726 --> 29:05.976
Oh, it's not just brothers.
Women wander too.

29:06.061 --> 29:08.429
Maybe kelvin is just trying to
get to know you again.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.014
I'm sure he doesn't wanna
open his heart just to
get stabbed.

29:12.351 --> 29:13.984
You talking about
kelvin or you?

29:14.520 --> 29:16.069
Does it matter?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.155
Come on, we're gonna be late.

29:18.240 --> 29:20.390
I had hoped shopping would
help but...

29:20.493 --> 29:23.393
You might wanna add bridgette
to your list of 99 problems

29:23.496 --> 29:26.163
'cause she is feeling
some type of way, girl.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.082
Yeah. Come on.

29:31.537 --> 29:32.586
Thank you.

29:35.674 --> 29:37.240
-[sighs]
-you feel better now?

29:37.343 --> 29:39.242
We have the entire vineyard,

29:39.345 --> 29:41.962
the house, the production
facility and the offices

29:42.047 --> 29:43.263
outfitted with
the latest tech.

29:43.382 --> 29:45.349
Whoever this extortionist is,

29:45.434 --> 29:48.268
is no match for this
tiger mom.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.854
I don't know. Maybe we should
lay low for a bit.

29:50.940 --> 29:53.474
-Get out of town.
Let this thing blow over.
-[vanessa] no.

29:53.559 --> 29:55.926
We are facing this thing
head on.

29:56.028 --> 29:59.530
Dana, get your little pi to
look into why your father had
all those passports for us.

29:59.615 --> 30:02.533
-[phone ringing]
-dana thinks it's some sort of
crime syndicate.

30:02.618 --> 30:04.368
-Right, babe?
-[dana] plot twist.

30:04.453 --> 30:07.654
Otis has a bunch of money
in his account that he didn't
get from his paychecks.

30:07.740 --> 30:09.206
Between the account and boat,

30:09.291 --> 30:11.291
-this definitely doesn't look
good for otis.
-[house help] no! Miss!

30:11.410 --> 30:13.410
-Miss!
-[lisa] you people are sick.

30:14.413 --> 30:15.996
You called the board?

30:16.081 --> 30:18.281
My editor's pressuring me
to kill the<i> asset makers</i> story

30:18.384 --> 30:20.283
and wipe the sd card
of your interview.

30:20.386 --> 30:23.620
As if it was my fault
that you one percent-ers
are dysfunctional.

30:23.722 --> 30:27.641
I just called an old friend
who would hate to see
a two-bit muckraker

30:27.760 --> 30:29.626
drown our good names
in the mud.

30:29.728 --> 30:32.980
-You can't control the story.
-Sure, we can.

30:33.098 --> 30:35.065
We didn't make all this money
for nothing.

30:35.150 --> 30:37.067
-Listen, lisa, is it?
-Yeah.

30:37.152 --> 30:41.488
Remember how you came in?
Well, you can go out
the exact same way.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.156
Unbelievable.

30:43.275 --> 30:45.609
-Bye, 99 percent-er.
-[chuckles]

30:46.996 --> 30:48.579
you called the board?

30:49.448 --> 30:50.313
For me?

30:50.416 --> 30:52.833
Dana, this housewife
has got your back.

30:54.119 --> 30:56.620
-I don't understand.
You didn't know?
-No.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.256
Honey.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.759
Just sit for a minute, please.
Please.

What your aunt yvette said

31:09.602 --> 31:10.517
is true.

31:11.854 --> 31:15.171
When we saw your little body
on that ultrasound,

31:15.274 --> 31:18.308
I couldn't bear the thought
of you having a hard life.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.528
But I chose to have you.

31:21.647 --> 31:24.281
'cause my baby boy was
gonna grow up to be a king.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.950
And I'd make sure of it.

31:27.036 --> 31:31.071
-I'm sorry I called you
a random housewife.
-[chuckles] it's okay, honey.

31:31.156 --> 31:34.024
And listen, it was your father
who called cambridge sloan

31:34.126 --> 31:35.876
and told them not to
give you the job.

31:35.995 --> 31:37.861
He wanted you here with us.

31:37.963 --> 31:41.698
Because he knew your
brilliance was needed
at the house of kings.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.033
Why didn't you tell me?

31:43.135 --> 31:45.719
Dana, I don't know.

31:45.838 --> 31:49.890
In fact, the more I think
I know about your father,
the less I do.

31:50.843 --> 31:52.375
Now,

31:52.478 --> 31:57.047
promise me that you will
never trust your
aunt melanie again.

31:57.149 --> 31:59.215
Honey, if you want the truth,
I am your mom.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.151
And I will always give it
to you.

32:14.249 --> 32:15.949

What are you talking about?

32:16.035 --> 32:18.251
Bridgette, slow down.

32:21.874 --> 32:25.008
So, I think I'm gonna send
my mom to that wine convention
next week,

32:25.094 --> 32:28.045
see if she could help with a
few last minute things we
might need before the launch.

32:28.881 --> 32:30.246
Right?

32:30.349 --> 32:32.082
I'm getting the police.
Bridgette just called.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.635
The extortionist poisoned
shawn and shawn's vines
with glyphosate.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.638
-The weed killer?
-Extortionist?

32:37.723 --> 32:40.423
Wait, that's insane.
Glyphosate will ruin the vines

32:40.526 --> 32:42.258
and the entire vineyard
will be destroyed.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.928
-Are we sure--
-I'm not waiting for your
permission, August.

32:45.030 --> 32:48.315
Otis has $50,000 in an account
that is unexplained

32:48.400 --> 32:50.117
and an $80,000 boat.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.869
He had beef with our dad
and he worked
at both vineyards.

Mom just got off the phone
with the hospital and...

33:19.732 --> 33:21.481
Otis is still
unconscious but...

33:23.369 --> 33:24.568
The way he ran

33:26.538 --> 33:27.954
just seems like he's guilty.

33:30.626 --> 33:32.459
I dragged my feet
and you acted.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.077
You forced my hand.

33:36.465 --> 33:37.464
I'm grateful, dana.

33:39.802 --> 33:42.719
You protected my vision
better than I did, and...

33:44.256 --> 33:46.506
It's gonna take both of us
to keep dad's dream alive.

33:51.897 --> 33:55.232
I can't believe otis
just ran from the police.

33:55.317 --> 33:57.300

to dad to make him wanna flee

-Well, all I know

34:06.612 --> 34:08.111
is my husband's a hero.

34:10.449 --> 34:15.619
Dana, you bossed up today
like a true king and a saint.

34:15.704 --> 34:18.588
Thank you for protecting
this family and this land.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.933

34:30.018 --> 34:32.686
I owe you for telling us
about shawn and shawn.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.139
Who else knows what else
otis could've done.

34:36.225 --> 34:39.509
But why'd you tell dana
and not me?

34:39.611 --> 34:42.112
I mean how long are you
gonna be pissed at me?

34:42.197 --> 34:45.348
August, you blocked me from
getting my job back
but dana supported me?

34:45.451 --> 34:47.784
Dana's playing both sides
of the fence, you know this.

34:47.870 --> 34:50.237
You used to put
friendship first.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.690
You used to do the right thing
because it was right.

Now, you're just about
the company's bottom line.

34:55.794 --> 34:58.128
You think I don't know
your value?

34:58.213 --> 35:01.465
It kills me that I forced you
to work at our competitor.

But you and me,
we can work through this.

35:11.093 --> 35:13.393
I know I sacrificed
our relationship for her
and...

35:14.980 --> 35:16.596
I hate that.

35:16.682 --> 35:20.016
I hate that I did this to
my friend, to my sister.

35:22.571 --> 35:25.489
But I'm just trying to pick up
the pieces that dad shattered.

35:25.574 --> 35:27.858
So, I'm gonna ask you
point blank,

35:28.861 --> 35:31.895
do you think that we could...

35:31.997 --> 35:34.197
Press a reset button
on our relationship?

Is that possible?
