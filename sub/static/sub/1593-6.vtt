00:03.921 --> 00:04.956
( car engine starts)

00:28.154 --> 00:31.942
J‘ Good Lord, take my hand J‘

00:32.116 --> 00:36.234
J‘ I've dried up
this promised land J‘

00:36.412 --> 00:41.532
J‘ Afraid that the sun
won't rise for me... J‘

00:41.709 --> 00:44.451
(crying)

00:44.629 --> 00:48.167
J‘ Good Lord, hear my cries J‘

00:48.341 --> 00:52.334
J‘ I've run out of wasted time J‘

00:52.511 --> 00:56.345
J‘ Dead just floating out to sea... J‘

00:56.515 --> 00:58.767
(snarling )

00:58.935 --> 01:00.800
Go away!

01:00.978 --> 01:05.347
J‘ 'Cause I got bad blood... J‘

01:05.524 --> 01:07.515
Go away!

01:07.693 --> 01:10.150
( car engine starts)

01:10.321 --> 01:12.312
( tires screech )

01:16.702 --> 01:20.820
J‘ Ooh, ooh J‘

01:20.998 --> 01:24.866
J‘ Ooh, ooh J‘

01:25.044 --> 01:28.957
J‘ Ooh, ooh J‘

01:29.131 --> 01:32.715
J‘ Ooh, ooh J‘

01:32.885 --> 01:36.673
J‘ Good Lord, find my soul J‘

01:36.847 --> 01:40.886
J‘ Waiting to be whole J‘

01:41.060 --> 01:46.054
J‘ Hold those gates
if I don't make it out tonight... J‘

01:47.858 --> 01:52.727
- ( rattles )
- J‘ Good Lord, give me peace J‘

01:52.905 --> 01:56.739
J‘ From a lifelong
of pain and greed J‘

01:56.909 --> 01:59.821
J‘ But not yet,
I'm not done paying J‘

01:59.996 --> 02:03.409
J‘ For my crimes J‘

02:05.209 --> 02:07.951
J‘ Bad blood J‘

02:08.129 --> 02:12.293
J‘ I got bad blood J‘

02:12.466 --> 02:16.209
J‘ You don't want none J‘

02:16.387 --> 02:21.381
J‘ Of what I have J‘

02:39.493 --> 02:42.735
J‘ Don't listen to any word I say J‘

02:42.913 --> 02:46.781
J‘ I'd say anything
to make you feel okay J‘

02:46.959 --> 02:50.668
J‘ I'm not who I thought I was J‘

02:50.838 --> 02:54.251
J‘ Not today J‘

02:54.425 --> 02:59.419
J‘ 'Cause I got bad blood J‘

02:59.597 --> 03:02.634
J‘ Bad blood J‘

03:02.808 --> 03:06.642
J‘ You don't want none J‘

03:06.812 --> 03:12.478
J‘ Of what I have. J‘

03:32.046 --> 03:34.958
(theme music playing )

04:09.917 --> 04:11.703
Carol: So it wasjust
you and Beth after?

04:11.877 --> 04:14.084
- Daryl: Yeah.
- You save her?

04:14.255 --> 04:17.964
She's tough.
She saved herself.

04:18.134 --> 04:20.341
We were out there
for a while.

04:20.511 --> 04:23.719
We got cornered, she got out
in front of me and...

04:23.889 --> 04:26.096
I don't know,
she was gone.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.677
I came out
and a car's pulling out

04:27.852 --> 04:30.434
with a white cross
on the window.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.515
- Just like that one?
- Yep.

04:32.690 --> 04:35.682
(snarling )

04:47.621 --> 04:50.704
Daryl: Rick's gonna wonder
where we went.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.161
Tank's runnin' low.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.827
We can end this quick.
Just run him off the road.

04:57.006 --> 04:59.338
Nah, we're good for a bit.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.497
If they're holding
her somewhere,

05:00.676 --> 05:02.291
we can get it out
of the driver.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.712
Yeah, but if he don't talk,
we're back to square one.

05:05.890 --> 05:08.882
Right now we got
the advantage.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.515
We'll see who they are.

05:10.686 --> 05:13.553
If they're a group,
see what they can do.

05:13.731 --> 05:14.971
And then we'll do
what we gotta do

05:15.149 --> 05:17.811
to get her back.

05:17.985 --> 05:21.603
They're heading north, l-85.

05:40.299 --> 05:43.291
(walker snarling )

06:11.914 --> 06:13.825
What the hell's he waiting for?

06:30.474 --> 06:32.465
There's two of 'em.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.010
Is that a cop?

06:42.528 --> 06:44.314
They might've seen us.

07:02.506 --> 07:04.212
(snarling )

07:04.383 --> 07:05.793
(sighs)

07:05.968 --> 07:08.710
(thudding)

07:37.374 --> 07:41.208
(snarling, thudding continue)

07:56.518 --> 08:00.181
( car engine sputters)

08:00.356 --> 08:03.974
Aw, shit!
Tank's tapped.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.732
They'd have taken the bypass
and they didn't.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.064
They must be holed up
in the city somewhere.

08:08.238 --> 08:10.729
(walkers snarling )

08:14.161 --> 08:17.494
We gotta move, find someplace
to hole up till sunlight.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.910
I know a place just a couple
of blocks from here.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.791
We can make it.

08:28.926 --> 08:31.918
- ( squelches )
-( rapid tapping )

08:36.141 --> 08:38.928
- Two more.
- I almost got it.

08:39.103 --> 08:41.845
(walkers snarling )

08:42.022 --> 08:43.728
Come on.

08:46.110 --> 08:48.101
(walkers snarling )

09:56.180 --> 09:59.172
You used to work here
or something?

09:59.349 --> 10:01.260
Something.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.164
( doorknob rattles )

10:31.715 --> 10:33.580
Hold on.

11:05.916 --> 11:09.079
- Daryl: What's this place?
- It's temporary housing.

11:15.551 --> 11:17.792
You came here?

11:17.970 --> 11:20.336
Carol: We didn't stay.

11:29.565 --> 11:31.977
I'll take the top bunk.

11:32.150 --> 11:33.936
I think that one's
more your style.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.647
( chuckles )

11:37.656 --> 11:40.898
You should sleep.
I'll take first watch.

11:41.076 --> 11:44.113
- This is locked up pretty tight.
- I know.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.245
Then we're good, then.

11:47.416 --> 11:50.783
I'll keep first watch.
I don't mind.

11:50.961 --> 11:53.452
Suit yourself.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.095
You said we get to start over.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.979
Daryl: Yeah.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.937
Did you?

12:17.279 --> 12:18.815
I'm tryin'.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.333
Why don't you say
what's really on your mind?

12:36.340 --> 12:39.457
I don't think we get
to save people anymore.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.184
Then why are you here?

12:51.688 --> 12:53.519
I'm tryin'.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.483
When we were out by the car...

13:07.788 --> 13:10.154
what if I didn't show up?

13:11.708 --> 13:14.290
I still don't know.

13:28.558 --> 13:31.550
(distant banging )

13:46.118 --> 13:48.234
(distant banging )

14:08.098 --> 14:11.056
(snarling )

14:26.950 --> 14:28.941
You don't have to.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.612
You don't.

14:55.479 --> 14:58.471
(birds chirping)

15:54.704 --> 15:56.956
Thank you.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.081
Daryl: That car
was headed downtown.

16:45.255 --> 16:47.587
I say we get up
in one of the tall ones,

16:47.757 --> 16:49.713
get ourselves a view,
see what we see.

16:49.885 --> 16:51.796
Stay close to the buildings
and keep quiet,

16:51.970 --> 16:55.462
but sooner or later,
we're gonna be drawing 'em.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.650
(walkers snarling )

17:18.580 --> 17:21.492
(walkers snarling )

17:35.805 --> 17:38.262
(snarling )

17:40.852 --> 17:42.968
All right,
we can get up there.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.011
There's a bridge.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.492
(snarling continues)

18:17.013 --> 18:19.504
( snarls )

18:52.257 --> 18:55.249
(walkers snarling )

19:22.912 --> 19:24.903
(walkers snarling )

19:26.708 --> 19:29.074
Some days, I don't know
what the hell to think.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.632
Good thing
we skipped breakfast.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.595
( whistles )

21:03.972 --> 21:06.839
How did we get here?

21:07.016 --> 21:09.348
Mm-mm.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.510
Wejust did.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.896
You still haven't
asked me what happened.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.187
After I met up
with Tyreese, the girls.

21:22.365 --> 21:24.822
Yeah, I know what happened.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.699
They ain't here.

21:28.705 --> 21:31.162
It was worse than that.

21:38.882 --> 21:42.124
The reason I said
we get to start over...

21:42.302 --> 21:44.338
is because we gotta.

21:48.725 --> 21:50.761
The way it was...

21:56.316 --> 21:58.307
Yeah.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.736
You see something?

22:07.911 --> 22:10.402
I don't know.
Hand me that rifle.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.388
Right there.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.897
It's been there a while.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.568
Definitely one of 'em.

22:44.739 --> 22:47.446
It's definitely
some kind of lead.

22:51.788 --> 22:53.278
We should fill up.

22:54.541 --> 22:56.577
All right.

22:56.751 --> 22:58.252
Hmm.

23:13.309 --> 23:15.800
What?

23:15.979 --> 23:19.437
I bet this cost some rich prick
a lot of money.

23:23.236 --> 23:25.147
Looks like a dog
sat in paint,

23:25.321 --> 23:27.983
wiped its ass
all over the place.

23:29.450 --> 23:33.193
Really?
I kinda like it.

23:33.371 --> 23:36.158
( laughs)
Stop.

23:36.332 --> 23:39.324
I'm serious.

23:39.502 --> 23:41.003
You don't know me.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.506
Yep, you keep
tellin' yourself that.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.922
(walkers snarling )

24:09.240 --> 24:11.481
- Daryl, don't.
- Get up.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.071
Hands up.
Both of you.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.831
Lay down your crossbow.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.708
You got some sack on you.

24:22.879 --> 24:23.868
Look, nobody has to get hurt.

24:24.047 --> 24:25.753
ljust need weapons, that's it.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.957
So, please,
lay down your crossbow.

24:39.062 --> 24:40.768
Back up.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.738
- Sorry about this.
- ( walker snarling )

24:52.909 --> 24:54.695
Ybulooktough.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.575
You'll be all right.

25:01.417 --> 25:04.580
(snarling )

25:09.425 --> 25:11.290
(gunshot)

25:15.348 --> 25:17.760
( door closes)

25:17.934 --> 25:20.767
( chains rattle )

25:25.233 --> 25:27.064
Three bullets.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.147
We're in the middle of a city.
He was stealing our weapons.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.194
Did you think
l was gonna kill him?

25:36.994 --> 25:39.030
l was aiming for his leg.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.786
Could that have killed him?
Maybe. I don't know.

25:40.957 --> 25:42.697
But he was stealing
our weapons.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.366
He's just a damn kid.

25:45.545 --> 25:47.410
Without weapons
we could die.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.328
Beth could die.

25:49.507 --> 25:52.715
We'll find more weapons.

25:52.885 --> 25:55.797
I don't want you to die.
I don't want Beth to die.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.462
I don't want anybody
at the church to die,

25:57.640 --> 26:00.632
but I can't stand around
and watch it happen either.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.301
I can't. That's why I left.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.140
ljust had to be somewhere else.

26:05.314 --> 26:08.147
Well, you ain't somewhere else.
You're right here.

26:08.317 --> 26:09.898
Tryin'.

26:12.655 --> 26:15.146
Look, you're not who you were
and neither am |.

26:16.367 --> 26:18.449
( exhales )

26:18.619 --> 26:21.110
I don't know if I believe in God
anymore or heaven,

26:21.289 --> 26:23.780
but if I'm going to hell,
I'm making damn sure

26:23.958 --> 26:25.243
I'm holding it off
as long as I can.

26:25.418 --> 26:26.658
( clatter)

26:31.674 --> 26:34.040
( clatter)

27:47.875 --> 27:50.036
All right,
let's get this done.

27:50.211 --> 27:53.078
It's not stable.
I'm lighter.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.634
(grunts)

27:57.802 --> 28:00.544
(snarling )

28:09.105 --> 28:11.266
( Carol grunts)

28:17.154 --> 28:19.645
( rattling )

28:29.917 --> 28:32.704
(walkers snarling )

28:35.464 --> 28:37.295
There's more coming.

28:37.466 --> 28:39.172
We're gonna
have to fight through.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.924
Yeah, I see 'em.

28:43.681 --> 28:46.047
- We have to go.
- GMH, what's that? A hospital?

28:46.225 --> 28:47.601
I don't know.
Grady Memorial, maybe?

28:47.768 --> 28:48.757
Grady, the white crosses--

28:48.936 --> 28:50.051
it might be where they're
holing up.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.265
(snarling )

28:57.820 --> 29:00.527
- Carol: Daryl!
- ( squelching)

29:00.698 --> 29:02.438
Daryl:
Go, go, go, go!

29:05.995 --> 29:07.701
(squelching )

29:22.803 --> 29:24.134
Anything we can use?

29:24.305 --> 29:26.512
Nothin' but what we got.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.101
Daryl:
All right, buckle up.

29:42.573 --> 29:45.360
(snarling )

29:55.002 --> 29:56.913
You hold on.

30:07.264 --> 30:10.256
(snarling continues faintly )

30:14.730 --> 30:18.063
-( Daryl groans)
- We're okay.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.724
We're okay.

30:24.323 --> 30:27.281
(bodies thudding)

30:33.207 --> 30:34.913
God.

30:35.918 --> 30:37.909
( groans )

30:47.054 --> 30:48.794
Ow.

30:49.849 --> 30:53.091
(walker snarling )

31:31.223 --> 31:32.554
Here.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.010
I'm fine.

31:34.185 --> 31:35.721
Prove it.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.646
How bad is it?

31:48.824 --> 31:50.985
I've had worse.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.741
Damn, that was stupid.

31:59.919 --> 32:01.580
We made good time down.

32:01.754 --> 32:03.494
( scoffs )

32:05.674 --> 32:08.256
There's only three blocks
between us and Grady.

32:10.346 --> 32:13.338
We need to find
a place nearby,

32:13.516 --> 32:15.848
scope it out,
see what we can see.

32:18.687 --> 32:19.893
You really think
we're gonna find out

32:20.064 --> 32:22.851
what we need to know
just by watching?

32:24.318 --> 32:25.774
It's where we start.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.435
Come on.

32:32.576 --> 32:35.864
( snarling weakly )

32:54.932 --> 32:56.923
lt's them.

33:04.608 --> 33:06.724
All right.

33:06.902 --> 33:09.109
Let's see what we see.

33:12.158 --> 33:15.446
(crunching)

33:27.840 --> 33:29.922
You said I ain't like
how I was before?

33:31.260 --> 33:32.249
Yeah.

33:33.679 --> 33:35.089
How was I?

33:37.183 --> 33:39.799
It's like you were a kid.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.807
Now you're a man.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.607
What about you?

33:58.787 --> 34:00.493
Me and Sophia stayed
at that shelter

34:00.664 --> 34:03.041
for a day and a half

34:03.209 --> 34:06.201
before I went
running back to Ed.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.245
I went home,
I got beat up, life went on,

34:09.423 --> 34:15.259
and ljust kept praying
for something to happen.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.466
But I didn't do anything.

34:18.641 --> 34:21.257
Not a damn thing.

34:24.605 --> 34:28.314
Who l was with him...

34:28.484 --> 34:29.894
she got burned away.

34:30.069 --> 34:33.732
And l was happy about that.
I mean, not happy, but...

34:33.906 --> 34:36.238
And at the prison

34:36.408 --> 34:41.118
I got to be who I always
thought I should be,

34:41.288 --> 34:43.825
thought I should've been.

34:46.961 --> 34:49.168
And then she got burned away.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.175
Everything nowjust...

34:57.346 --> 34:59.837
consumes you.

35:05.521 --> 35:08.012
Well, hey...

35:08.190 --> 35:09.771
we ain't ashes.

35:18.117 --> 35:20.278
( distant door closes )

35:32.965 --> 35:34.956
(thudding)

35:37.636 --> 35:39.627
(walker snarling )

35:43.767 --> 35:46.930
(thudding continues)

35:47.104 --> 35:49.641
(snarling continues)

35:53.485 --> 35:55.225
Is that yours?

35:55.404 --> 35:57.315
Yeah.

36:05.414 --> 36:07.746
- ( automatic gunfire )
- ( walker snarling )

36:14.340 --> 36:16.752
(yelling)

36:18.385 --> 36:21.343
( groans )
Oh, God.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.762
I'm good.

36:24.933 --> 36:26.764
I'm good. You go.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.063
God.
( panting )

36:30.230 --> 36:33.222
(man grunting)

36:49.917 --> 36:53.580
- ( snarling)
- ( groaning, gasping)

36:57.383 --> 36:59.795
Plea-- please.
I had to protect myself.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.253
Why you following us?

37:01.428 --> 37:03.464
l-l didn't, I swear!
I thought you followed me.

37:03.639 --> 37:04.970
Bullshit.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.256
(walker continues snarling )

37:14.233 --> 37:17.066
Noah: Come on, man.
Plea-- please!

37:17.236 --> 37:19.227
( groans )

37:19.405 --> 37:22.147
- Please, please.
- Nah.

37:22.324 --> 37:24.064
I already helped you once.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.859
It ain't happenin' again.

37:28.247 --> 37:29.657
Noah:
Please.

37:29.832 --> 37:32.824
(walker continues snarling )

37:34.753 --> 37:36.493
Have fun with Hoss
over there.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.003
Noah:
No.No,no,no.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.425
No. No, no, no!
Please! Please!

37:40.592 --> 37:42.002
Please!
I'm sorry, please!

37:42.177 --> 37:44.668
- Please! Please, please!
- Daryl. Daryl. Stop.

37:44.847 --> 37:46.257
You almost died 'cause of him!

37:46.432 --> 37:48.013
But I didn't.

37:52.521 --> 37:56.013
Nah, let him be.

37:58.861 --> 37:59.850
- Noah: I'm sorry.
- Daryl!

38:00.028 --> 38:01.017
Noah: Please, I'm sorry!

38:01.196 --> 38:03.528
(yelling)

38:03.699 --> 38:05.690
(snarling )

38:16.003 --> 38:19.086
( distant gunfire )

38:40.027 --> 38:43.519
( distant gunfire continues )

39:13.560 --> 39:16.222
(grunting)

39:16.396 --> 39:19.183
Come on,
just a little more.

39:19.358 --> 39:21.690
Oh, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.851
( panting )

39:27.241 --> 39:28.902
Daryl:
You okay?

39:31.912 --> 39:33.903
You okay?

39:34.081 --> 39:36.242
I'm still here.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.577
I gotta go. I gotta go.

39:38.752 --> 39:40.743
They're gonna come.
They probably heard the shot.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.912
If they find me...

39:43.090 --> 39:45.456
- Who?
- Them. People at the hospital.

39:45.634 --> 39:46.623
Wait, wait, wait,
just tell us--

39:46.802 --> 39:47.962
is there
a blonde girl there?

39:48.136 --> 39:50.718
- You see a blonde girl?
- Beth?

39:50.889 --> 39:52.470
Daryl: You know her?

39:54.601 --> 39:56.387
She helped me get out,
but she's still there.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.639
They're coming.

40:01.817 --> 40:04.103
We gotta go now.
We gotta go. We gotta go.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.313
The building next door
has a basement.

40:09.491 --> 40:11.823
It's clear.
We'll be safe.

40:11.994 --> 40:13.609
Ah! Ah!

40:13.787 --> 40:15.243
Daryl:
Go, I got him.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.745
Come on, get up.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.622
- Get up.
- ( groans ) Okay.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.160
( tires screech )

40:25.340 --> 40:26.921
No, no, no!
Wait, wait, wait!

40:27.092 --> 40:28.707
- Let go of me!
- Wait! They can help her.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.136
They're the only ones who can.

40:30.304 --> 40:33.512
They have medicine,
machines, a doctor.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.799
You go out there,
you'll have to kill them, okay?

40:36.977 --> 40:39.468
And then she can't get their help.
Is that what you want?

40:39.646 --> 40:42.137
( panting )

40:42.316 --> 40:44.602
We can get her back.
We can get Beth back.

40:48.030 --> 40:50.737
What's it gonna take?

40:50.907 --> 40:53.614
A lot.

40:53.785 --> 40:56.868
They got guns, people.

40:58.874 --> 41:00.660
So do we.

41:03.003 --> 41:05.494
(snarling )

42:13.490 --> 42:16.106
(theme music playing )
