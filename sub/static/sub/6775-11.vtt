03:07.730 --> 03:10.255
HE DOESN'T LOOK
A LITTLE FUNNY ?

03:10.260 --> 03:11.898
OF COURSE HE LOOKS
A LITTLE FUNNY.

03:11.900 --> 03:13.788
THAT'S HIS
DADDY'S NOSE.

03:13.800 --> 03:16.451
HE'S JUST

03:16.460 --> 03:20.419
THE BEAR WENT
OVER THE MOUNTAIN

03:20.430 --> 03:23.524
THE BEAR WENT OVER

03:24.660 --> 03:27.094
THERE'S MY

03:29.430 --> 03:31.990

04:47.660 --> 04:49.719
YOU'RE STILL HERE ?

04:51.830 --> 04:53.821
WHAT, NO BREAKFAST ?

04:53.830 --> 04:56.424
I'VE GOT TO

05:03.200 --> 05:06.351

07:09.030 --> 07:10.827
LOVELY WAY TO

07:10.830 --> 07:13.924
BRENDA, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO FACE HIM SOMETIME.

07:13.930 --> 07:17.388
SOMETIME,
JUST NOT NOW.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.122
LET'S GET
MAJOR ESPRESSOS,

07:20.130 --> 07:21.825
TAKE A WALK

07:28.660 --> 07:31.857
THE ANNUAL WESTERN STATES
FUNERAL DIRECTOR'S CONFERENCE.

07:31.860 --> 07:33.953
WAS THAT TODAY ?

07:33.960 --> 07:35.996
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS MONTHS AWAY.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.855
NO, JUST ME AND DAVID
AND 300 FUNERAL DIRECTORS,

07:38.860 --> 07:40.452
CUTTING LOOSE
IN THE CITY OF SIN.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.223
WHY WOULD YOU DO
THAT TO YOURSELF ?

07:42.230 --> 07:43.720
ONE, WE GET TO
ATTEND HELPFUL SEMINARS

07:43.730 --> 07:45.357
WHERE WE LEARN NEW
TRICKS OF THE TRADE.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.523
TWO, WE GET TO COMMISERATE
WITH ALL THE OTHER SAD FUCKS

07:48.530 --> 07:50.259
WHO ARE BEING EDGED OUT
BY KROEHNER.

07:50.260 --> 07:54.151
THREE, WE HAVE
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

07:54.160 --> 07:55.957
TO GET IN MATI' GILARDI'S FACE
AND TELL HIM

07:55.960 --> 07:58.292
WE KNOW KROEHNER BURNED DOWN
THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.497
AH, THE ONGOING
PISSING CONTEST.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.492
THAT'LL BE GOOD
FOR YOU AND DAVID.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.195
YOU'LL HAVE FUN.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.555
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH FUN
HE'S GONNA HAVE.

08:08.560 --> 08:09.891
HE'S GIVING THIS

08:09.900 --> 08:12.551
BIG SPEECH ABOUT THE FUTURE OF
THE INDEPENDENT FUNERAL HOME.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.050
DAVID DOESN'T
STRIKE ME

08:14.060 --> 08:16.119
AS THE TYPE OF GUY
WHO GIVES SPEECHES.

08:16.130 --> 08:18.451
MY DAD WAS SCHEDULED
TO DO IT.

08:18.460 --> 08:20.849
DAVE VOLUNTEERED
TO FILL IN.

08:20.860 --> 08:24.990
IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL FOR HIM,
HE'S PRETTY NERVOUS ABOUT IT.

08:26.100 --> 08:27.897
CALL ME FROM VEGAS.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.049
I WILL.

08:31.060 --> 08:32.721
UNLESS I'M FLAILING
ABOUT IN A POOL

08:32.730 --> 08:34.527
HAVING SEX
WITH SOME SHOWGIRL.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.498
I'LL MISS YOU.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.858
( phone )

08:39.860 --> 08:41.919
OH, FUCK YOU !

08:44.500 --> 08:47.321
I KNOW THIS IS AN EXCEPTIONALLY
DIFFICULT TIME FOR YOU,

08:47.330 --> 08:50.891
BUT, CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND
FOR YOUR SON'S...

08:50.900 --> 08:53.050
I'M SORRY.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.597
WE'RE ONLY HERE
BECAUSE THE HOSPITAL

08:55.600 --> 08:57.420
SUGGESTED WE
CALL YOU GUYS,

08:57.430 --> 09:01.491
WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE
WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.393
HE WAS A PERFECT LY
HEALTHY BABY.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.493
CAN I ASK, WHAT WAS
THE CAUSE OF...

09:10.360 --> 09:12.419
UH, SIDS.

09:12.430 --> 09:14.921
YES, WELL, IF YOU NEED
TO TAKE SOME TIME

09:14.930 --> 09:16.955
BEFORE WE START
MAKING ARRANGEMENTS,

09:16.960 --> 09:18.996
THAT'S COMPLETELY
UNDERSTAN DABLE.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.092
THE ARRANGEMENTS ?

09:20.100 --> 09:21.453
WHAT ARRANGEMENTS ?

09:21.460 --> 09:24.725
FOR HIS FUNERAL.

09:25.200 --> 09:26.792
FUNERAL ?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.554
HE WAS ONLY
THREE WEEKS OLD.

09:30.560 --> 09:31.891
IT MIGHT HELP...

09:31.900 --> 09:33.197
IF YOU THINK OF IT
LESS AS A FUNERAL

09:33.200 --> 09:35.054
AND MORE AS A WAY OF
SAYING GOODBYE TO HIM.

09:35.060 --> 09:39.554
I DON'T WANT TO SAY GOODBYE,
HE JUST BARELY GOT HERE.

09:40.800 --> 09:44.793
OF COURSE IT'S DIFFICULT
FOR ANYONE TO COME TO TERMS

09:44.800 --> 09:47.018
WITH SOMETHING AS UNEXPECTED
AS THIS, BUT...

09:47.030 --> 09:49.021
IT'S NOT
JUST DIFFICU LT.

09:49.030 --> 09:51.851
IT'S NOT EVEN
REMOTELY POSSIBLE.

09:54.330 --> 09:57.959
SOME BABIES ARE JUST
TOO GOOD FOR THIS WORLD.

10:00.330 --> 10:03.197
WE'LL FIX THINGS SO YOU CAN
SPEND AS MUCH TIME WITH HIM

10:03.200 --> 10:04.428
AS YOU NEED.

10:09.930 --> 10:11.158
HOW OLD IS HE ?

10:11.160 --> 10:12.821
BARELY THREE WEEKS.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.092
SIDS ?

10:14.100 --> 10:15.988
YEAH.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.327
OH, JESUS.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.355
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE
FOR THE INTAKE.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.794
THE PARENTS ARE PRACTICALLY
CHILDREN THEMSELVES.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.428
THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEY WERE
SUPPOSED TO HAVE A FUNERAL.

10:26.430 --> 10:27.897
WELCOME BACK, RICO.

10:27.900 --> 10:30.118
THAN KS, NATE.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.620
YOU SURE
YOU'RE UP TO THIS ?

10:31.630 --> 10:33.427
YEAH, IT'S NO PROBLEM.

10:33.430 --> 10:35.648
WE'LL ONLY BE GONE
'TIL SUNDAY.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.025
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,

10:37.030 --> 10:39.453
I CAN HOP ON A PLANE
AND BE BACK HERE
IN AN HOUR AND A HALF.

10:39.460 --> 10:41.724
I'LL BE FINE.

10:55.460 --> 10:58.099
I HAVE SOME OF
YOUR T-SHIRTS HERE,

10:58.100 --> 10:59.556
THEY'RE STILL WARM.

10:59.560 --> 11:00.754
MOM.

11:08.760 --> 11:11.797
OH, DON'T LET ME
STOP YOU.

11:20.060 --> 11:23.427
YOU KNOW, I PROBABLY SHOULD
TAKE A COUPLE OF THOSE T-SHIRTS

11:23.430 --> 11:26.149
WITH ME TO
LAS VEGAS.

11:30.730 --> 11:32.527
DAVID, I WANT TO
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

11:32.530 --> 11:33.895
I'M REALLY KIND OF
IN A HURRY HERE.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.824
I JUST WANTED
TO KNOW...

11:39.760 --> 11:41.398
ARE YOU--

11:41.400 --> 11:45.052
MOM, CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN I GET BACK FROM LAS VEGAS ?

11:46.030 --> 11:47.327
YES, OF COURSE.

11:47.330 --> 11:50.151
THAT'S A LOVELY IDEA.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.323
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT WHEN
YOU GET BACK FROM LAS VEGAS.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.589
MRS. DIMAS ?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.625
UH, IT'S
CLAIRE FISHER.

11:59.630 --> 12:01.450
I'M SORRY TO
KEEP CALLING,

12:01.460 --> 12:02.996
I WAS JUST
WONDERING IF YOU...

12:03.000 --> 12:05.423
HEARD ANYTHING
FROM GABE YET.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.257
WHAT ?

12:10.630 --> 12:11.995
WHEN ?

12:13.360 --> 12:14.622
OH, MY GOD.

12:14.630 --> 12:16.894
IS HE OKAY ?

12:17.960 --> 12:20.190
WHAT HOSPITAL ?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.623
OKAY, THANK YOU,
MRS. DIMAS, THANK YOU.

12:37.230 --> 12:38.254
YOU ARE LATE.

12:38.260 --> 12:39.227
10 MINUTES.

12:39.230 --> 12:40.697
I KNOW, I'M SORRY.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.918
IT'S OKAY.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.227
I JUST WANT
YOU TO KNOW

12:44.230 --> 12:47.028
THAT I NOTICE THIS
KINDS OF THINGS.

12:47.030 --> 12:49.123
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
NIKOLAI.

12:50.430 --> 12:51.556
WE HAVE TO TALK.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.118
IT'S ABOUT
YOUR WORK.

12:53.130 --> 12:55.052
I SAID I WAS SORRY
FOR BEING LATE.

12:55.060 --> 12:59.019
NO, NO, NO, HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH BEING LATE.

12:59.030 --> 13:02.727
IS ABOUT HOW YOU
ARRANGE THE FLOWERS.

13:03.330 --> 13:04.695
WHAT ?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.656
THERE HAVE BEEN COMPLAINTS
FROM SOME OF THE CUSTOMERS.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.649
THERE HAVE NOT.

13:07.660 --> 13:08.649
OH, AFRAID SO.

13:08.660 --> 13:12.619
RUTH, YOU ARE NOT
SO GOOD AT ARRANGING.

13:12.630 --> 13:13.597
I AM TOO.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.658
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

13:14.660 --> 13:16.594
FROM NOW ON, ROBBIE WILL
HANDLE ARRANGEMENTS

13:16.600 --> 13:19.558
AND YOU WILL WORK THE REGISTER
AND HELP WITH THE BOOKS.

13:19.560 --> 13:21.528
I DON'T WANT TO HELP
WITH THE BOOKS !

13:21.530 --> 13:24.749
I HELPED MY HUSBAND WITH
THE BOOKS FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.352
I WANT TO DO
FLOWER ARRANGEMENTS.

13:26.360 --> 13:28.590
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY ARRANGEMENTS.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.558
NOT ALL ARRANGEMENTS
ARE FOR FUNERALS, CUPCAKE.

13:33.260 --> 13:35.353
YOU THINK MY
ARRANGEMENTS LOOK...

13:35.360 --> 13:36.497
FUNEREAL ?

13:36.500 --> 13:38.388
IT'S LIKE ROBBIE SAID,

13:38.400 --> 13:40.527
THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW
COMPLAINTS FROM SOME CUSTOMERS.

13:40.530 --> 13:42.851
WE DONE TALKING NOW.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.397
ROBBIE WILL DO
THE ARRANGEMENTS.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.698
YOU WILL WORK
ON THE REGISTER.

13:56.130 --> 13:58.121
HEY, ARE YOU GONNA
NAIL GILARDI

13:58.130 --> 13:59.825
FOR THE ARSON JOB
IN YOUR SPEECH ?

13:59.830 --> 14:00.694
NO.

14:00.700 --> 14:01.758
WHY NOT ?

14:01.760 --> 14:03.591
HMM, LET'S THINK.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.329
POSSIBLE LIBEL CHARGES,
MAYBE.

14:05.330 --> 14:07.491
MIND IF I SAY
SOMETHING TO HIM ?

14:07.500 --> 14:08.592
YES, DON'T.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.692
PUSSY.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.726
NATE, DO WE HAVE ANY
EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM ? NO.

14:12.730 --> 14:14.357
APPARENTLY THE POLICE
DON'T EITHER.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.523
I DON'T WANT YOU PICKING
A FIGHT WITH GILARDI.

14:17.530 --> 14:18.997
WHY NOT ?

14:19.000 --> 14:20.752
YOU BASICALLY THREATENED
TO KILL HIM THAT ONE TIME.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.125
( horn )

14:24.430 --> 14:26.352
I'M COMING WITH YOU.

14:26.360 --> 14:28.191
UH, GREAT.

14:35.860 --> 14:37.999
IT'S OKAY ?
YEAH.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.627
I NEED TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.052
ALRIGHT.

14:41.930 --> 14:43.659
OH, MY GOD,
IS THAT A PENIS ?

14:43.660 --> 14:44.592
RICO !

14:44.600 --> 14:45.498
I'M SORRY.

14:45.500 --> 14:46.649
IT IS,
ISN'T IT ?

14:46.660 --> 14:48.992
YOUR WIFE DOESN'T
WANT ME TO SAY.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.650
THE BABY'S OKAY,
RIGHT ?

14:51.660 --> 14:53.025
THE BABY IS FINE.

14:53.030 --> 14:56.329
BUT YOU HAVE MILD TO
MODERATE PREECLAMPSIA.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.218
WHAT IS
PREECLAMPSIA ?

14:58.230 --> 15:00.118
A 10-DOLLAR WORD FOR
PRENATAL HYPERTENSION.

15:00.130 --> 15:02.621
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS
A LITTLE HIGHER THAN WE'D LIKE.

15:02.630 --> 15:04.598
IT COULD CAUSE YOU AND
THE BABY SOME PROBLEMS,

15:04.600 --> 15:05.521
IF IT GETS
OUT OF HAND,

15:05.530 --> 15:07.191
BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.258
WHAT KIND
OF PROBLEMS ?

15:08.260 --> 15:09.727
LET'S NOT
EVEN GO THERE.

15:09.730 --> 15:11.288
THIS BABY'S FINE.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.120
WORSE COMES TO WORSE,

15:13.130 --> 15:14.950
WE GO IN A LITTLE EARLY,
WE DO A C-SECT ION.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.848
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK
AT YOUR LABS

15:16.860 --> 15:18.896
AND CHECK YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE
IN A DAY OR TWO

15:18.900 --> 15:20.822
AND SEE HOW
WE'RE DOING THEN.

15:20.830 --> 15:23.993
UNTIL THEN, I WANT YOU
ON STRICT BED REST.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.959
I REALLY WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT THIS.

15:28.960 --> 15:31.326
THE BABY IS FINE.

15:36.730 --> 15:38.391
HEY.

15:39.860 --> 15:40.895
HEY.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.118
IF YOU CAME LOOKING
TO COLLECT MORE MONEY

15:43.130 --> 15:44.893
FOR ANTHONY'S FUNERAL,

15:44.900 --> 15:46.390
I'M ALL TAPPED OUT
AT THE MOMENT.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.958
THIS ONE...

15:47.960 --> 15:50.690
SHOOTS UP TOO MUCH
SPEED AND HEROIN.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.693
NOW I'M STUCK PAYING FOR
THIS FANCY-ASS HOTEL ROOM

15:54.700 --> 15:56.850
TO THE TUNE OF
400 BUCKS A POP

16:00.000 --> 16:02.457
I'M GOING OUT FOR
COFFEE AND SMOKES.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.219
SPEED AND HEROIN ?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.855
YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.691
DIFFERENT LIKE WITH
A NEEDLE IN YOUR ARM ?

16:20.700 --> 16:22.190
HEY, WHAT IS THIS ?!

16:22.200 --> 16:24.327
20 FUCKING QUESTIONS ?!

16:24.330 --> 16:26.025
I'VE BEEN THROUGH
THIS ALREADY, ALRIGHT ?

16:26.030 --> 16:28.897
WITH THE DOCTORS,
WITH THE POLICE,
WITH MY MOM.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.595
NOW I GOTTA PUT
YOUR MIND AT EASE, TOO ?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.124
I'M SORRY.

16:32.130 --> 16:34.155
I WOULD'VE BEEN FINE

16:34.160 --> 16:36.355
IF YOU HAD JUST MINDED
YOUR OWN FUCKING BUSINESS.

16:36.360 --> 16:39.090
WELL, EXCUSE ME
FOR GIVING A SHIT !

16:49.200 --> 16:51.350
THIS WASN'T AN ACCIDENT,
WAS IT ?

16:56.660 --> 16:59.595
I WISH YOU WOULD JUST
FUCKING LEAVE ALREADY.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.955
( raising tv volume )

17:02.960 --> 17:05.121
FINE, HERE.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.553
( tv chatter )

17:17.600 --> 17:19.192
"THE EMERGING ROLE
OF FUNERAL DIRECTORS

17:19.200 --> 17:20.929
IN MASS AVIATION
DISASTERS."

17:20.930 --> 17:22.124
THAT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

17:22.130 --> 17:24.098
DO YOU REALIZE HOW MANY
OF THESE SEMINARS

17:24.100 --> 17:25.727
ARE SPONSORED
BY KROEHNER ?

17:27.130 --> 17:28.324
WHO'S JASMINE BRECKER ?

17:28.330 --> 17:31.049
SHE'S EITHER A FEDERAL JUDGE
OR A SEX SURROGATE,

17:31.060 --> 17:32.493
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.024
YOU GOT
ANY MATCHES ?

17:34.030 --> 17:35.224
SURE.

17:36.430 --> 17:37.351
THANK YOU.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.793
OKAY, BOYS...

17:38.800 --> 17:41.018
LET'S MINGLE.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.422
WHEN IN ROME.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.423
I THINK MAYBE
MY EXPECTATIONS

17:48.430 --> 17:50.921
OF THIS TRIP
WERE A LITTLE HIGH.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.152
OH, GREAT,
HAPPY HOUR.

17:58.700 --> 18:00.327
WELL, WELL.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.456
THE FISHER BROTHERS.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.189
YOU KNOW,
I WONDERED IF...

18:03.200 --> 18:04.929
YOU'D EVEN
BOTHER TO SHOW.

18:04.930 --> 18:07.319
I UNDERSTAND YOU'LL
BE SPEAKING TOMORROW,

18:07.330 --> 18:08.820
IN PLACE OF
YOUR FATHER.

18:08.830 --> 18:10.695
WHAT WAS YOUR...

18:10.700 --> 18:12.099
TOPIC AGAIN ?

18:12.100 --> 18:13.692
THE FUTURE OF INDEPENDENT
FUNERAL HOMES.

18:13.700 --> 18:16.624
WELL, I'M CERTAINLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.429
I'D INVITE YOU BOYS
TO THE KROEHNER PARTY

18:19.430 --> 18:21.193
AT THE LUXOR,
BUT...

18:21.200 --> 18:23.191
IT'S ONLY
FOR AFFILIATES.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.998
OH, DAMN, 'CAUSE WE'D
REALLY LIKE TO BE THERE.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.251
I MEAN, I'M SURE
YOU CORPORATE LACKEYS

18:27.260 --> 18:29.148
REALLY KNOW
HOW TO PARTY.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.628
HAVE FUN WITH THE OTHER
DINOSAURS, BOYS.

18:31.630 --> 18:34.053
OH, MATT, I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

18:34.060 --> 18:35.823
THIS IS A PACK
OF MATCHES.

18:35.830 --> 18:39.197
THIS IS FOR A CAN
OF LIGHTER FLUID.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.919
NEXT TIME YOU NEED TO UNLOAD
SOME CUMBERSOME REAL ESTATE,

18:41.930 --> 18:43.295
YOU'LL BE ALL SET.

18:48.730 --> 18:50.823
NATE, THAT WAS
NOT SMART.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.799
I SHOULD'VE SET
HIS FUCKING HAIR ON FIRE.

18:54.560 --> 18:55.959
BOTTOMS UP.

19:04.400 --> 19:08.154
WELL, BABY,
WHAT I COULDN'T DO

19:09.030 --> 19:12.158
WITH PLENTY OF
MONEY AND YOU

19:12.160 --> 19:14.754
I LOVE LAS VEGAS.

19:14.760 --> 19:17.320
IT HAS TO BE THE MOST
ARTIFICIAL PLACE ON EARTH.

19:17.330 --> 19:19.025
YOU THINK SO,
MORE THAN DISNEYLAND ?

19:19.030 --> 19:21.453
OH, COME ON,
MORE THAN JAPAN.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.396
OOH.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.819
OH, MY GOD.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.889
WHAT ARE ALL TH ESE
LITTLE CARTOON EXPLOSIONS

19:29.900 --> 19:31.094
ALL OVER
THEIR BUTTS ?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.727
THEY LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE FARTING.

19:32.730 --> 19:34.618
YEAH, LOOK, COUPONS.

19:34.630 --> 19:37.053
HEY, DAVE, YOU WANNA WALK
ACROSS THE STREET WITH US,

19:37.060 --> 19:39.858
GET SOME OF THAT FAMOUS
LAS VEGAS $4.99 PRIME RIB ?

19:39.860 --> 19:41.794
I HAVE IT ON GOOD AUTHORITY
IT'S JUST AS GOOD AS

19:41.800 --> 19:43.654
THE $6.99 PRIME RIB
OVER THERE.

19:43.660 --> 19:45.423
NO, I THINK I'LL JUST
HEAD UP TO MY ROOM,

19:45.430 --> 19:48.126
ORDER SOME ROOM SERVICE,
MAKE AN EARLY NIGHT OF IT.

19:48.130 --> 19:49.552
YOU SURE ?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.427
YEAH, I SHOULD WORK
ON MY SPEECH, ANYWAY.

19:52.430 --> 19:53.727
OKAY.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.197
WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.293
DON'T DO ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

19:57.300 --> 19:59.029
NOT LIKELY.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.123
I HAVE TWO WORDS
FOR YOU.

20:01.130 --> 20:02.119
LAP...

20:02.130 --> 20:03.392
DANCE.

20:03.400 --> 20:04.799
WHO SAYS I WANT
A LAP DANCE ?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.222
WHO SAYS
IT'S FOR YOU, BABY ?

20:06.230 --> 20:08.050
OOH, KINKY.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.295
I THOUGHT I LIKE,
TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

20:29.300 --> 20:30.892
I DROVE ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO BARSTOW,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.949
IF YOU THINK I'M JUST GONNA
TURN AROUND AND DRIVE BACK,

20:33.960 --> 20:35.552
YOU'RE SERIOUSLY WHACKED.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.596
THIS IS, LIKE, TOTALLY
BUMFUCK EGYPT OUT HERE.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.953
YOU SPENT THE NIGHT ?

20:38.960 --> 20:40.848
YEAH, I SLEPT
IN MY CAR.

20:45.300 --> 20:46.653
MY MOM STILL HERE ?

20:46.660 --> 20:49.220
NO, SHE WENT OUT
FOR MORE CIGARETTES.

20:51.530 --> 20:53.498
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING
TO HER ABOUT...

20:55.260 --> 20:56.921
NO.

20:59.330 --> 21:01.025
ARE YOU GONNA ?

21:01.030 --> 21:03.498
I HAVEN'T DECIDED.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.224
YOU HUNGRY ?

21:07.230 --> 21:08.652
NO.

21:08.660 --> 21:10.651
I CAN'T EAT THIS HOSPITAL SHIT,
IT ALL TASTES THE SAME.

21:11.530 --> 21:12.895
HERE.

21:12.900 --> 21:15.323
I GOT YOU AN EGG MCMUFFIN 'CAUSE
I KNOW THEY'RE YOUR FAVORITE.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.495
HOW IS IT ?

21:24.500 --> 21:27.719
FUCKING COLD.

21:31.430 --> 21:33.352
BUT GOOD.

21:38.330 --> 21:39.354
THAN KS.

22:08.130 --> 22:10.792
IN THIS CLASS,
WE'RE GONNA BE WORKING ON

22:10.800 --> 22:12.722
FREE FORM
SUMMER ARRANGEMENTS

22:12.730 --> 22:15.221
AND IF WE HAVE ANY TIME
AT THE END OF CLASS,

22:15.230 --> 22:16.549
I'M NOT PROMISING

22:16.560 --> 22:18.699
BECAUSE I WANT US TO GET TO
OUR BREATHING EXERCISES,

22:18.700 --> 22:20.429
BUT IF WE HAVE TIME,

22:20.430 --> 22:23.354
WE MIGHT TRY A SPIKY
ARRANGEMENT OR TWO.

22:23.360 --> 22:24.896
(oohing and ahhing )

22:24.900 --> 22:26.788
BUT FIRST WE'RE GONNA START
BY DOING A LITTLE WORK

22:26.800 --> 22:28.791
TREATING OUR STEMS.

22:28.800 --> 22:32.429
AND WE'RE GONNA START BY
WORKING WITH OUR WOODY STEMS

22:32.430 --> 22:34.819
BECAUSE THEY CAN BE
A LITTLE ON THE TRICKY SIDE

22:34.830 --> 22:38.254
AND REQUIRE
THE MOST T-L-C.

22:38.260 --> 22:41.127
TOUGH LOVING CARE.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.519
OKAY, LET'S START
WITH AN AZALEA,

22:43.530 --> 22:45.327
ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

22:46.160 --> 22:49.027
STARTING AN INCH OR TWO
FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE STEM,

22:49.030 --> 22:51.851
AND IF IT'S A THICK STEM,
WE REALLY HAVE TO SMASH THEM.

22:51.860 --> 22:54.954
WE SPLIT THE STEM
VERTICALLY.

22:54.960 --> 22:57.952
DOES ANYONE KNOW
WHY WE DO THIS ?

22:59.430 --> 23:00.692
ANYONE ?

23:00.700 --> 23:02.053
YES.

23:03.560 --> 23:05.118
SO, IT WILL
DRAW MORE WATER ?

23:05.130 --> 23:06.552
VERY GOOD.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.754
DID EVERYONE
HEAR THAT ?

23:07.760 --> 23:09.125
SO IT WILL DRAW...

23:09.130 --> 23:10.552
MORE WATER.

23:10.560 --> 23:12.619
OKAY, DOES EVERYONE
HAVE THEIR HAMMERS ?

23:12.630 --> 23:15.155
LET'S BEGIN.

23:25.900 --> 23:26.958
HEY.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.848
HEY.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.852
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN BED.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.454
I NEEDED TO GET
SOME TURKEY FRANKS
AND MILK FOR JULIO.

23:36.460 --> 23:37.722
WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ME ?

23:37.730 --> 23:39.493
I COULD'VE STOPPED HOME
ON MY WAY FROM WORK.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.058
HE HAS A SNACK
AT 3:30.

23:41.060 --> 23:42.596
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL YOUR SISTER ?

23:42.600 --> 23:45.251
SHE JUST GOT TWO DAYS
ON A NICHOLAS CAGE MOVIE.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.421
SHE PLAYS THIS HOOKER
WHO WITNESSES A MURDER

23:49.760 --> 23:52.126
SHE WANTS ME TO COME
VISIT HER ON THE SET.

23:52.130 --> 23:53.654
WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IN BED.

23:53.660 --> 23:55.059
I GOT BORED,
I WENT TO THE MARKET.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.618
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?

23:56.630 --> 23:57.858
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME
THIS TIME OF DAY ANYWAY ?

23:57.860 --> 24:00.351
I CAME HOME FOR LUNCH,
I WAS WORRIED.

24:00.360 --> 24:01.850
RICO, PLEASE,

24:01.860 --> 24:03.088
I'M FINE.

24:03.100 --> 24:04.749
I'M NOT JUST
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

24:06.700 --> 24:07.951
OKAY.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.020
THIS IS ABOUT
THE BABY AT WORK.

24:11.030 --> 24:12.850
I JUST CAN'T DO IT.

24:12.860 --> 24:16.352
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

24:21.430 --> 24:23.193
HE LOOKS LIKE...

24:23.200 --> 24:24.758
LIKE HE'S SLEEPING.

24:24.760 --> 24:27.854
LIKE A BABY WHO'S
FALLEN ASLEEP.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.250
HE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD,

24:31.260 --> 24:33.922
THERE WAS NOTHING
WRONG WITH HIM.

24:35.330 --> 24:37.753
AND THEN,
JUST LIKE THAT...

24:37.760 --> 24:39.990
HE DIES.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.219
FOR NO REASON.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.492
HOW CAN THAT BE ?

24:46.500 --> 24:50.129
HOW CAN THE BEGINNING AND END
BE SO DAMN CLOSE TOGETHER ?

24:52.830 --> 24:56.095
AND NOW, I'VE GOT THIS
REAL BAD FEELING.

24:58.060 --> 25:01.188
I HAVEN'T DONE A BABY
SINCE JULIO WAS BORN.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.794
DAVID ALWAYS DOES THEM.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.953
SO, MAKE DAVID
DO THIS ONE.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.656
DAVID'S IN VEGAS
UNTIL TOMORROW.

25:11.660 --> 25:15.050
THE VIEWING IS
THIS AFTERNOON.

25:19.860 --> 25:23.023
SOME BABIES JUST AREN'T
MEANT FOR THIS WORLD, RICO.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.559
BUT THIS ONE IS.

25:38.030 --> 25:40.954
IF YOU'LL TURN TO PAGE SEVEN
IN YOUR NOTEBOOKS,

25:40.960 --> 25:43.258
WE'LL GO STEP-BY-STEP TH ROUGH
THE MOST CHALLENGING

25:43.260 --> 25:46.889
CRANIAL FACIAL RECONSTRUCTION
I EVER FACED.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.248
IF WE COULD GO TO
THE NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE

25:53.130 --> 25:55.325
OH, MY GOD.

25:55.330 --> 25:56.649
AW, JESUS.

25:56.660 --> 25:58.992
THAT SHIT IS
FUCKED UP.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.854
NATE, THIS IS
CHLOE YORKIN.

26:00.860 --> 26:04.523
THE JOB FEDERICO LEFT US
TO DO FOR KROEHNER ?

26:04.530 --> 26:08.125
THAT IS LIKE FUCKING
SCIENCE FICTION.

26:10.030 --> 26:13.193
THE FIRST QUESTION MY TEAM
AND I ASKED OURSELVES WAS NOT,

26:13.200 --> 26:15.919
AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AT
A FACILITY WITH LESS RESOURCES,

26:15.930 --> 26:17.795
CAN WE DO THIS ?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.358
THEY DON'T EVEN CREDIT
RICO BY NAME.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.420
OH, MAN, HE'S GONNA
BE FURIOUS.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.627
( laughing )

26:28.630 --> 26:30.495
OH, GOD.

26:30.500 --> 26:32.718
WELL, THAT IS A VERY
GENEROUS OFFER, ROGER,

26:32.730 --> 26:36.257
BUT UNFORTUNATELY I AM IN
A RELATIONSHIP AT THE MOMENT--

26:36.260 --> 26:39.354
DEAL ME IN.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.929
JESUS, BILLY.

26:43.860 --> 26:45.122
HOLD ON.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.325
HEY, HEY, SO,
WHERE'S YOUR BOYFRIEND ?

26:47.330 --> 26:49.628
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?

26:49.630 --> 26:50.858
I LOVE VEGAS.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.122
YOU KNOW
I LOVE VEGAS.

26:52.130 --> 26:53.722
AND SOMETIMES WHEN MY SISTER
ISN'T THERE WHEN I NEED HER,

26:53.730 --> 26:56.426
I HOP IN MY CAR,
START DRIVING,
AND WIND UP HERE.

26:56.430 --> 26:57.658
BILLY, YOU'RE LYING.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.196
I'M REALLY NOT, OKAY ?

26:59.200 --> 27:00.394
I JUST SAW YOU
AT THE BLACKJACK TABLE.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.549
IT WAS A TOTAL
COINCIDENCE.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.959
YOU'RE
A FUCKING LIAR.

27:02.960 --> 27:05.929
YOU'RE A SELFISH, MANIPULATIVE,
NARCISSISTIC LIAR.

27:08.830 --> 27:11.390
WHAT DID MOM
AND DAD TELL YOU ?

27:11.400 --> 27:14.449
UH, THEY TOLD ME
THAT YOU MADE A BOMB.

27:17.030 --> 27:18.520
THAT'S FUCKING
HILARIOUS.

27:18.530 --> 27:20.293
SO, NOW I'M LIKE,
WHAT, A TERRORIST ?

27:20.300 --> 27:22.359
BILLY MCVEIGH ?

27:24.300 --> 27:26.450
THEY'RE FUCKING
LIARS, BRENDA !

27:26.460 --> 27:28.655
THEY HATE EACH OTHER
AND THEY'RE MISERABLE

27:28.660 --> 27:29.991
AND THEY'RE
JEALOUS OF US

27:30.000 --> 27:31.422
AND THEY WANT US TO
HATE EACH OTHER TOO.

27:31.430 --> 27:32.692
SO, THEY LIE TO US !

27:32.700 --> 27:34.156
NO, THEY LIED TO ME,
YOU LIED TO ME.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.094
YOU LET ME BELIEVE THAT
YOU TRIED TO KILL YOURSELF.

27:36.100 --> 27:37.453
DO YOU KNOW HOW
FUCKED THAT IS ?

27:37.460 --> 27:39.223
YOU KNOW WHAT, I WAS
SO FUCKIN' DRUGGED UP,

27:39.230 --> 27:41.551
I DON'T EVEN REALLY
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.028
DAD SHOWED ME
WHAT YOU WROTE.

27:49.300 --> 27:50.790
I WAS KIDDING, OKAY ?

27:50.800 --> 27:53.928
IT WASN'T SERIOUS.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.622
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

27:56.630 --> 27:59.121
WHAT I GAVE UP
FOR YOU ?

27:59.130 --> 28:00.825
BECAUSE I THOUGHT

28:00.830 --> 28:03.526
THAT IF YOU TRIED
TO KILL YOURSELF AGAIN
AND SUCCEEDED

28:03.530 --> 28:06.294
I COULD TELL MYSELF THAT I DID
EVERYTHING I COULD TO SAVE YOU.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.449
AND YOU DID.

28:07.460 --> 28:10.122
YOU HAVE SAVED ME
EVERY DAY SINCE THEN.

28:10.130 --> 28:12.257
YEAH, WELL,
FUCK YOU !

28:12.260 --> 28:13.022
BRENDA !

28:13.030 --> 28:15.055
JUST BACK OFF.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.358
YOU HEARD HER,
NOW, FUCK OFF !

28:21.860 --> 28:23.396
NICE.

28:29.100 --> 28:31.159
ARE YOU OKAY ?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.425
HE FOLLOWED US HERE.

28:37.030 --> 28:39.919
WELL, I HATE TO SAY IT,
BUT I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURPRISED.

29:18.160 --> 29:20.094
VERY NICE.

29:20.100 --> 29:22.898
OH, LUSCIOUS...

29:25.530 --> 29:28.351
THIS IS A LITTLE...

29:28.360 --> 29:30.055
TIGHT.

29:30.060 --> 29:31.322
TIGHT ?

29:31.330 --> 29:33.525
YOU'RE NOT
BREATHING RIGHT.

29:33.530 --> 29:35.054
I'M NOT ?

29:35.060 --> 29:37.028
YOU'RE BREATHING
FROM HERE.

29:37.030 --> 29:39.555
WHEN YOU SHOULD BE
BREATHING FROM HERE.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.289
BUT MY LUNGS
ARE HERE.

29:41.300 --> 29:42.551
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

29:42.560 --> 29:43.993
I'M SPEAKING
METAPHORICALLY.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.627
IF YOU BREATHE
FROM UP HERE,

29:45.630 --> 29:48.190
YOUR ARRANGEMENTS
WILL COME FROM UP HERE.

29:48.200 --> 29:50.657
IF YOU BREATHE
FROM DOWN HERE,

29:50.660 --> 29:52.855
YOUR ARRANGEMENTS WILL
COME FROM DOWN HERE.

29:52.860 --> 29:53.849
AND THAT'S GOOD ?

29:53.860 --> 29:55.327
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

29:55.330 --> 29:56.524
DO YOU DO YOGA ?

29:56.530 --> 29:58.225
NO.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.653
OKAY, WOULD EVERYBODY GRAB
A YOGA MAT IN THE NEXT ROOM ?

30:00.660 --> 30:02.594
WE'RE GONNA DO
SOME BREATHING EXERCISES

30:02.600 --> 30:04.795
BEFORE WE BREAK
FOR DINNER.

30:06.330 --> 30:09.697
YOU'RE A BIT OF
A CONTROL FREAK, AREN'T YOU ?

30:09.700 --> 30:10.951
NO, I'M NOT.

30:10.960 --> 30:12.996
I DON'T THINK I AM.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.149
AMI?

30:14.160 --> 30:15.650
YES.

30:15.660 --> 30:17.594
AND CONTROL FREAKS DO NOT
MAKE GOOD ARRANGERS.

30:17.600 --> 30:19.249
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

30:19.260 --> 30:20.818
I USED TO BE
A CONTROL FREAK TOO.

30:20.830 --> 30:22.024
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT ?

30:22.030 --> 30:23.759
YOU CAN GET OVER IT.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.194
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS LEARN TO BREATHE.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.997
ARE YOU ON
ANTI-DEPRESSANTS ?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.353
NO!

30:29.360 --> 30:32.625
OH, WELL, LORD KNOWS I'D BE LOST
WITHOUT MY SAINT JOHN'S WORT.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.498
THERE ARE
COUNTLESS CHALLENGES

30:37.500 --> 30:40.492
FACING INDEPENDENT
FUNERAL HOMES TODAY.

30:40.500 --> 30:43.549
CHANGING SOCIAL ATTITUDES
TOWARD DEATH AND DYING,

30:43.560 --> 30:45.528
ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

30:45.530 --> 30:48.294
IN COMMUNITIES
BOTH LARGE AND SMALL.

31:05.860 --> 31:07.191
OH, WHAT THE HELL ?

31:09.030 --> 31:11.919
WE ALL KNOW WHAT
THE REAL CHALLENGE IS.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.497
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY,
MR. GILARDI ?

31:17.500 --> 31:20.856
FINE, THANK YOU.

31:20.860 --> 31:22.259
GLAD TO HEAR IT.

31:22.260 --> 31:25.923
WE ALL KNOW OF
A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION

31:25.930 --> 31:28.398
THAT CONTROLS THE FLOW
OF PREP ROOM SUPPLIES,

31:28.400 --> 31:30.721
CASKETS,
CEMETERY PROPERTY,

31:30.730 --> 31:33.949
AND FLOWERS TO
EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.019
AND BELIEVE ME,

31:36.030 --> 31:38.191
THAT ORGANIZATION WILL STOOP TO
ALMOST ANY MEANS TO MAKE SURE

31:38.200 --> 31:40.919
THAT THE INDEPENDENT
FUNERAL HOME HAS NO FUTURE.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.124
BUT HEAR ME OUT.

31:42.130 --> 31:45.896
MY FATHER WAS IN THIS BUSINESS
FOR OVER 35 YEARS.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.959
HE...

31:49.130 --> 31:51.325
HE THOUGHT IT WAS
OKAY TO TELL PEOPLE

31:51.330 --> 31:52.627
ABOUT A CHEAPER CASKET.

31:52.630 --> 31:56.327
HE DIDN'T ALWAYS TRY TO
TALK PEOPLE OUT OF CREMATION.

31:56.330 --> 31:58.628
THERE WERE EVEN TIMES
I ACTUALLY HEARD HIM SAY,

31:58.630 --> 32:01.428
"TO HELL WITH OUR
PROFIT MARGIN ON THIS."

32:01.430 --> 32:04.456
THESE WORDS ARE HERESY
TO A CERTAIN ORGANIZATION

32:04.460 --> 32:07.258
BECAUSE PROFIT
IS ALL IT CARES ABOUT,

32:07.260 --> 32:09.956
NO MATTER HOW MANY
P.R.-MOTIVATED SEMINARS
IT SPONSORS.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.929
AND THAT ORGANIZATION WANTS
US INDEPENDENTS TO BELIEVE

32:12.930 --> 32:15.751
THAT WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE
LIKE MY FATHER ANYMORE.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.694
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT THAT'S BULLSHIT.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.758
DON'T GET ME WRONG,

32:18.760 --> 32:20.398
MY FATHER WORRIED ABOUT
THE BOTTOM LINE TOO.

32:20.400 --> 32:21.890
BUT HE WORRIED MORE
ABOUT OTHER THINGS,

32:21.900 --> 32:24.698
LIKE COM FORTING PEOPLE,

32:24.700 --> 32:27.851
AND HELPING THEM
FACE PROFOUND LOSS.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.494
MAYBE NOW,

32:31.500 --> 32:32.694
MAYBE NOW,
MORE THAN EVER,

32:32.700 --> 32:35.294
WE SHOULD ALL TRY TO BE
A LITTLE MORE LIKE HIM.

32:37.630 --> 32:38.995
THANK YOU.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.498
( whistling )

33:10.130 --> 33:11.495
HOW'D I DO ?

33:11.500 --> 33:12.728
ARE YOU KIDDING ?

33:12.730 --> 33:14.948
YOU KICKED SOME SERIOUS ASS,
YOU BIG FREAK.

33:20.630 --> 33:24.088
YOU DIDN'T COME
HOME LAST NIGHT.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.824
IT'S NOT LIKE IT WAS
A SCHOOL NIGHT.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.353
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO
MAKE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT ?

33:31.360 --> 33:33.828
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.996
DO YOU THINK
I'M A CONTROL FREAK ?

33:44.000 --> 33:47.128
UM, YEAH.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.652
WHERE DO YOU THINK
DAVID GETS IT FROM ?

33:50.660 --> 33:54.050
YOUR FATHER WAS
VERY CONTROLLING.

33:54.060 --> 33:55.596
NOT LIKE YOU.

33:55.600 --> 33:57.192
THAT'S NOT NICE.

33:57.200 --> 33:59.054
YOU ASKED.

34:02.030 --> 34:04.828
YOU'RE NOT AS BAD
AS YOU USED TO BE.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.594
MAY I ASK WHERE
YOU WERE ALL NIGHT ?

34:10.600 --> 34:11.897
IN BARSTOW.

34:11.900 --> 34:14.824
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
WERE YOU DOING THERE ?

34:14.830 --> 34:17.321
I WAS VISITING A FRIEND OF MINE
WHO'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

34:17.330 --> 34:18.456
WHO ?

34:20.360 --> 34:21.622
GABRIEL DIMAS.

34:22.730 --> 34:25.654
THE YOUNG MAN
WHOSE BROTHER...

34:25.660 --> 34:26.490
YEAH.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.225
WHAT WAS HE DOING
IN THE HOSPITAL ?

34:32.760 --> 34:34.819
HE OD'ed.

34:34.830 --> 34:37.128
GOOD LORD.

34:40.530 --> 34:41.929
CLAIRE...

34:43.400 --> 34:45.618
HE'S OBVIOUSLY
A DEEPLY DISTURBED BOY.

34:45.630 --> 34:48.428
YOU NEED TO STEER
CLEAR OF HIM.

34:48.430 --> 34:51.490
LET HIS FAMILY
DEAL WITH THIS.

34:51.500 --> 34:54.890
WELL, LET'S TAKE STOCK
FOR A SECOND, SHALL WE ?

34:56.860 --> 34:58.623
HIS LITTLE
BROTHER'S DEAD.

34:58.630 --> 34:59.858
HIS FATHER'S DEAD.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.623
HIS STEPFATHER
BEAT HIM UP.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.723
HIS WHITE TRASH MOTHER
WHO SMOKES LIKE A FISH

35:03.730 --> 35:04.924
COULD GIVE A SHIT.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.694
THAT LEAVES NO ONE.

35:09.730 --> 35:12.426
WAS HIS OVERDOSE
AN ACCIDENT ?

35:12.430 --> 35:14.853
OF COURSE IT
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.691
BECAUSE SOMETIMES
THESE THINGS AREN'T.

35:16.700 --> 35:18.998
AND IF IT WASN'T,
IT COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.059
THERE'S AN 80%
CHANCE THAT SOMEONE--

35:21.060 --> 35:22.550
IT WASN'T
A SUICIDE ATTEMPT.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.950
I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.225
BUT IF YOU'RE
WRONG, CLAIRE...

35:29.230 --> 35:32.358
I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
TOO CLOSE TO HIM.

35:34.960 --> 35:41.752
( breathing deeply)

35:44.300 --> 35:46.450
LOOK AT HIM...

35:47.200 --> 35:49.088
HE'S A STAR.

35:50.730 --> 35:52.288
I JUST WANT YOU GUYS
TO MEET SOMEONE.

35:54.430 --> 35:56.796
THIS IS MY BROTHER,
AND UH, PARTNER.

35:56.800 --> 35:58.097
NATHANIEL JR.

35:58.100 --> 35:59.294
AND HIS, UH...

35:59.300 --> 36:00.949
JASMINE.

36:00.960 --> 36:03.099
HEY THERE,
I'M NEIL SCHAGER.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.556
SCHAGER AND SONS
FROM FLAGSTAFF.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.027
RAYMOND DOOLEY.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.725
DOOLEY AND MOSS FUNERAL HOME,
RENO, NEVADA.

36:07.730 --> 36:09.027
MOSS COULDN'T
BE HERE.

36:09.030 --> 36:10.349
BLADDER CANCER.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.328
THAT WAS A HELL OF
A SPEECH DAVID MADE.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.321
ALMOST MADE ME CRY WHEN
THOSE KROEHNER BASTARDS

36:14.330 --> 36:15.695
GOT UP AND LEFT.

36:15.700 --> 36:17.622
THOSE FUCKERS HAVE BEEN
TRYING TO BUY US OUT

36:17.630 --> 36:20.190
FOR FIVE
GODDAMN YEARS.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.656
YOUR FATHER
WAS A GOOD MAN.

36:21.660 --> 36:23.628
YES, HE WAS.

36:23.630 --> 36:25.518
Y'ALL DON'T MIND IF
WE DRAG YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

36:25.530 --> 36:26.428
OUT WITH US,
DO YOU ?

36:26.430 --> 36:27.454
I REALLY SHOULDN'T.

36:27.460 --> 36:29.155
YOU GOTTA LET US BUY YOU
A DRINK AT LEAST.

36:29.160 --> 36:30.388
YOU'RE OUR HERO.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.628
WELL, MAYBE JUST
A QUICK ONE.

36:31.630 --> 36:32.892
QUICK ONE,
MY AUNT FAN NY.

36:32.900 --> 36:34.049
WE'RE GONNA MAKE
A NIGHT OF IT.

36:34.060 --> 36:35.152
HEY, YOU WANT
TO GO WITH ?

36:35.160 --> 36:36.229
THE MORE THE MERRIER.

36:36.230 --> 36:38.357
OH, I DON'T
THINK SO.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.396
WE'RE JUST GONNA
LAY LOW TONIGHT.

36:40.400 --> 36:43.096
YEAH, BUT YOU GUYS
HAVE FUN.

36:43.100 --> 36:45.250
OKAY, YOUR LOSS.

37:04.730 --> 37:06.857
EXCUSE ME.

37:06.860 --> 37:09.328
WE'D JUST LIKE
TO THANK YOU.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.059
VERY MUCH.

37:12.060 --> 37:13.857
HE LOOKS
SO BEAUTIFUL.

37:13.860 --> 37:15.259
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE PLEASED.

37:15.260 --> 37:17.820
MIKE'S MOM AND DAD
DROVE DOWN FROM SALINAS.

37:17.830 --> 37:19.092
YEAH.

37:19.100 --> 37:21.352
THEY NEVER GOT
A CHANCE TO MEET HIM.

37:21.360 --> 37:25.456
NOW IT'S ALMOST
LIKE THEY DID.

37:27.500 --> 37:29.320
DO YOU
HAVE CHILDREN ?

37:29.330 --> 37:31.355
YES, YES, I DO.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.524
I HAVE
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD BOY

37:35.530 --> 37:37.122
AND...

37:37.130 --> 37:39.018
YES.

37:43.900 --> 37:46.152
WE'D LIKE TO BE ALONE
WITH HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE

37:46.160 --> 37:48.151
IF THAT'S OKAY.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.525
OH, ABSOLUTELY,
ABSOLUTELY.

37:49.530 --> 37:51.748
PLEASE TAKE AS MUCH
TIME AS YOU NEED.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.155
SAY FROMAGE !

38:18.160 --> 38:19.229
FROMAGE.

38:19.230 --> 38:20.527
HEY.

38:20.530 --> 38:22.054
HEY.

38:22.060 --> 38:24.528
YOU WERE REALLY
GREAT TODAY, NATE.

38:24.530 --> 38:26.395
STANDING UP
TO BILLY.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.652
I FELT LIKE SOME
WHITE TRASH GIRL

38:28.660 --> 38:30.890
WHOSE BOYFRIEND WAS
THE BIGGEST BAD-ASS IN TOWN.

38:30.900 --> 38:33.551
YOUR BROTHER'S
SERIOUSLY ILL, BRENDA.

38:33.560 --> 38:35.096
YEAH, WHATEVER.

38:35.100 --> 38:36.226
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT ?

38:36.230 --> 38:38.448
WE'RE IN FAUX PARIS,
SO, LET'S PARTY.

38:42.060 --> 38:48.852
( French song playing )

39:44.600 --> 39:47.319
( dance music playing )

40:16.060 --> 40:17.459
HI.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.827
I'M AMBER.

40:19.830 --> 40:21.457
DAVID.

40:21.460 --> 40:23.553
YOU'RE A LUCKY GUY...

40:23.560 --> 40:25.755
DAVID.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.159
IAM?

40:27.160 --> 40:28.491
VERY.

40:28.500 --> 40:31.298
YOUR FRIEND JUST BOUGHT YOU
A LAP DANCE WITH ME.

40:34.230 --> 40:35.595
EXCUSE ME ?

40:35.600 --> 40:38.228
SO, WHERE YOU FROM,
DAVID ?

40:40.430 --> 40:43.524
THAT IS THE COLDEST PLACE
I EVER LIVED.

40:43.530 --> 40:46.590
WHAT PART OF TOWN
YOU LIVE IN ?

40:46.600 --> 40:48.124
UH, DOWNTOWN.

40:57.360 --> 41:00.488
ARE YOU EVEN
ENJOYING THIS...

41:00.500 --> 41:02.422
AT ALL ?

41:02.430 --> 41:04.398
YEAH, I'M
LOVING IT, WHY ?

41:04.400 --> 41:05.753
BECAUSE...

41:05.760 --> 41:08.524
YOUR DICK ISN'T
RESPONDING ONE BIT.

41:12.330 --> 41:13.820
LOOK, I'M GAY.

41:13.830 --> 41:15.149
IT'S NOT YOU.

41:15.160 --> 41:16.422
HONEY.

41:16.430 --> 41:17.829
IT NEVER IS ME.

41:17.830 --> 41:19.593
WELL, IF YOU'RE GAY.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.296
YOU WON'T MIND IF WE CUT
THIS ONE SHORT, WILL YOU ?

41:27.560 --> 41:28.925
