WEBVTT

00:02.770 --> 00:05.022
I understand _
there are some questions

00:05.070 --> 00:07.789
about my opponent's hiring
and promotion practices

00:07.840 --> 00:10.058
over at the _
state's attorney's ofﬁce.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.407
I don't intend to speak to that.

00:11.440 --> 00:13.704
But I do think diversity
is a fair...

00:13.740 --> 00:15.776
"But I do think diversity..."
(Alicia sneezing)

00:16.580 --> 00:17.604
(sneezing)

00:17.650 --> 00:19.413
DIANE:
A little under
the weather?

00:19.450 --> 00:20.519
Oh, just a little.

00:20.550 --> 00:21.710
You needed me?

00:21.750 --> 00:23.388
Yes, how's it feel
to be an equity partner?

00:23.420 --> 00:24.409
Good.

00:24.450 --> 00:25.815
The power surging
through you?

00:25.850 --> 00:27.818
Something's surging through me.
(chuckling)

00:27.860 --> 00:29.782
So the, um, Bishop defense.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.479
I was looking
over the billable hours.

00:31.530 --> 00:32.827
They're coming
in a bit high.

00:32.860 --> 00:34.225
That's usually
not a problem,

00:34.260 --> 00:36.569
but Bishop
is a top legacy client.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.261
We don't want him
to think we're padding him.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.437
So, I need you to rein it in.

00:39.470 --> 00:40.596
Um, that's Cary's team.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.834
Do you want me to get him?

00:41.870 --> 00:44.134
No. That's your team.

00:44.170 --> 00:45.762
You're the equity partner
in charge,

00:45.810 --> 00:46.834
as of now.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.836
Right, I will get right on that.

00:48.880 --> 00:50.302
Just find out if the hours
are being inflated.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.339
And if they're not,

00:51.380 --> 00:53.268
steer the group onto a
more conservative path.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.515
What's up?
Oh, I need to head
out this afternoon.

00:55.550 --> 00:57.745
I was hoping you could
look over the civil proposal.

00:57.790 --> 00:59.382
(sneezing)

00:59.420 --> 01:00.580
There's another cold.

01:00.620 --> 01:02.554
You two need to stay away
from me.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.683
Um, do you need
anything else, Diane?

01:04.730 --> 01:07.551
No, thank you.
(Alicia coughing)

01:10.130 --> 01:12.530
(sneezing)

01:12.570 --> 01:14.435
*

01:16.170 --> 01:17.137
Hi.

01:17.170 --> 01:19.604
I was thrilled to get your call.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.469
This is a working lunch.

01:23.510 --> 01:25.171
I know.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.110
But I was thrilled.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.414
Your wiretap has been
thrown out, Mr. Perrotti.

01:29.450 --> 01:31.247
Uh, Josh.

01:31.290 --> 01:36.182
Your wiretap has been
found inadmissible, Josh.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.720
You have nothing
on my client

01:37.760 --> 01:38.681
so we ask the
Department of Justice

01:38.730 --> 01:40.891
to cease and desist
from harassing Eli Gold.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.125
I ordered for us.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.195
I hope that
wasn't presumptuous.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.198
Well, I'm not
that hungry.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.834
(clears throat)

01:49.870 --> 01:52.270
You were saying?

01:52.310 --> 01:54.130
I was?
What was I...?

01:54.180 --> 01:55.875
Oh.

01:55.910 --> 01:59.243
Here you are in
Petra Moritz's column.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.612
Mm-hmm.

02:01.650 --> 02:04.915
"Is Florrick strategist,
Eli Gold, off the hook yet?

02:04.950 --> 02:06.281
"Not according to
a conversation

02:06.320 --> 02:07.912
"overheard at Parrillan

02:07.960 --> 02:11.623
between a certain unnamed source
and AUSA Josh Perrotti."

02:11.660 --> 02:12.854
Well, they misspelled
my name.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.165
"I know personally Eli
Gold was buying votes.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.237
He's going down;
He's going down hard."

02:19.270 --> 02:22.433
So, Josh, are we
on a witch hunt?

02:22.470 --> 02:25.303
The problem is, Elsbeth,

02:25.340 --> 02:26.739
you and I
are a lot alike.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.202
We're competitive.

02:28.240 --> 02:29.605
Onion naan?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.800
No, thank you.

02:31.850 --> 02:35.217
And I know
Eli is guilty.

02:35.250 --> 02:39.653
So, I found another way
to prove the charge.

02:39.690 --> 02:40.918
Conspiracy.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.325
Really?

02:42.360 --> 02:43.588
Mm-hmm.

02:43.630 --> 02:49.193
Well, conspiracy requires
a coconspirator.

02:49.230 --> 02:50.458
And who might that be?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.560
This unnam_ed source
at Parrillan?

02:53.600 --> 02:57.730
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

02:57.770 --> 02:59.601
No, that's for
me to know, too.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.777
Discovery.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.869
Then take me to court.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.412
You want me to
take you to court?

03:10.850 --> 03:12.488
I can't wait for you
to take me to court.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.249
I love the shape
of your lips.

03:16.290 --> 03:17.780
You leave my
lips out of it.
I can't.

03:17.830 --> 03:20.253
They're so pillovw.

03:34.640 --> 03:37.006
PETER:
Look”.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.449
all you have to do
is go to prison once

03:38.480 --> 03:40.948
on a false corruption charge,

03:40.980 --> 03:43.016
and you're going to take it
very, very seriously.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.711
MODERATOR:
Thank you, Mr. Florrick.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.014
Miss Hayward, you have
two minutes to respond.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.016
I don't need two minutes
to respond.

03:49.060 --> 03:51.722
I just need two words:
"Eli Gold."

03:51.760 --> 03:54.957
Peter's
own campaign manager

03:55.000 --> 03:56.058
is accused
of corruption...

03:56.100 --> 03:58.523
PETER:
Uh, he is no longer
my campaign manager.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.969
Eli Gold has resigned.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.558
Yes, but you
can understand

04:01.600 --> 04:03.909
why I should
take your intolerance

04:03.940 --> 04:05.737
for corruption with
a grain of salt.

04:05.770 --> 04:06.907
Well,
unlike Miss Hayward,

04:06.940 --> 04:09.738
I like to get all the facts
before I make a judgement.

04:09.780 --> 04:12.044
But you said that Eli Gold
is off of your campaign.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.775
No, I said he resigned.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.879
So you do accept corruption
or you would've fired him.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.717
What I don't accept
are having my words

04:17.750 --> 04:18.819
twisted into something
Uh, Peter.

04:18.850 --> 04:21.250
Peter. Peter.
which is not what I...

04:22.990 --> 04:24.059
Let's take ten.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.297
Peter.

04:26.330 --> 04:27.490
Here's the thing:

04:27.530 --> 04:28.451
You're tall.
Uh-huh.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.468
And you're much taller
than the actual Maddie.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.058
So, when you go
after her like that,

04:32.100 --> 04:33.067
it looks like
you're bullying.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.930
Should I crouch?

04:33.970 --> 04:35.733
No, she's the one
down in the polls.

04:35.770 --> 04:37.328
Make her look desperate.

04:37.370 --> 04:39.008
Keep your words calm,
noncombative.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.007
Don't go aggressive.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.701
You know,
absorb the punches.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.446
Like Obama, in his
first debate.

04:43.480 --> 04:44.640
No, this is different.

04:44.680 --> 04:45.544
This is about
the women's vote.

04:45.580 --> 04:48.378
You go angry, you're
going to remind women

04:48.420 --> 04:50.012
of their
first husbands.
(phone vibrating)

04:50.050 --> 04:51.085
Excuse me.

04:51.120 --> 04:53.611
Yeah.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.718
I hope that was all right.

04:54.760 --> 04:55.852
No, that's why
you're here.

04:55.890 --> 04:57.482
Don't let up on me,
because she won't.

04:57.530 --> 04:59.327
By the way, thanks
for doing this.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.328
Oh, my pleasure.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.328
So, I hear the
state's attorney's office

05:03.370 --> 05:04.962
is looking for a new
outside firm

05:05.000 --> 05:06.695
to represent it
on its civil suits.

05:06.740 --> 05:10.335
You heard about Brandelslq
& Turner going bankrupt?

05:10.370 --> 05:12.406
Yeah, that seems to
be happening a lot.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.408
I know we_ were allowed
to pitch the first time around.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.101
I hope we're
allowed to pitch the second.

05:16.140 --> 05:19.416
Well, unfortunately,
it's not up to me.

05:19.450 --> 05:21.918
I've put together a team of ASAs
to interview.

05:21.950 --> 05:22.939
But, you know what?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.719
I'm going to...
I'm going to

05:24.750 --> 05:25.819
tell them that
you're interested.

05:25.850 --> 05:26.817
Thank you.

05:26.860 --> 05:27.884
That'd be great.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.456
_ Once more
Into the fray?

05:29.490 --> 05:30.752
Oh, you're going down.

05:30.790 --> 05:31.950
Oh, we'll see.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.093
(laughing)

05:33.130 --> 05:35.394
ELSBETH:
How're you going to do this?

05:35.430 --> 05:37.125
KALIN DA:
Do what?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.468
Find out _who this
coconspirator Is?

05:39.500 --> 05:40.831
I don't know.

05:40.870 --> 05:41.894
You don't know?

05:41.940 --> 05:43.066
Don't you
have a plan?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.099
I don't plan.

05:44.140 --> 05:45.368
(gasps)

05:45.410 --> 05:46.399
You're a crazy woman.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.407
Reservation?

05:47.440 --> 05:48.771
Hello.

05:48.810 --> 05:51.005
I'm Mr. Joshua _Perrotti's
personal assnstant,

05:51.050 --> 05:53.644
and he came in here yesterday
for lunch.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.875
He was supposed
to give his number

05:55.920 --> 05:57.148
to his waitperson

05:57.190 --> 05:58.214
regarding a personal matter.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.411
But he doesn't remember the name
of his waitperson.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.382
(giggling)

06:04.030 --> 06:06.157
Um, is there-is there any way

06:06.190 --> 06:07.555
you could find out
who served him?

06:07.600 --> 06:09.568
He was here for lunch?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.090
Uh, 12:30, 1:00 reservation.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.119
Perrotti,
Perrotti.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.899
I don't see it.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.134
Do you know who
he was having lunch with?

06:15.170 --> 06:16.535
May I take a peak?

06:22.780 --> 06:26.375
ELSBETH:
Frank Landau of the DNC.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.484
You turned on me?
What?

06:35.520 --> 06:36.828
You went to the Feds?

06:36.860 --> 06:38.680
What do you want, Eli?

06:38.730 --> 06:40.755
They're using
you to get to me.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.153
Who said that?

06:42.200 --> 06:44.668
You got yourself printed
up in Petra Moritz

06:44.700 --> 06:46.691
saying I paid for votes.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.537
They're coming
after me, Eli.

06:48.570 --> 06:52.165
So you threw me to them?

06:52.210 --> 06:53.768
My head and my career
were on the chopping block.

06:53.810 --> 06:55.437
You'd do the same.

06:56.140 --> 06:58.176
What do they have, Frank, huh?

06:58.210 --> 06:59.711
What did
you give them?

06:59.750 --> 07:01.672
(keys fall to floor)

07:03.220 --> 07:04.847
You got to calm down, Eli.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.187
They're coming after me.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.017
You calm the hell down.
I don't know you.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.527
Anything I did wrong was
at your prompting, Frank.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.152
I don't know you, and this
encounter never happened.

07:11.190 --> 07:12.179
I will find a way
to bring you down.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.219
I'm going into my office,

07:13.260 --> 07:15.626
and I'm not listening
to another word being said.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.662
(door closes)

07:19.500 --> 07:21.138
So all our attempts at bail
have failed.

07:21.170 --> 07:23.468
Lemond Bishop is still
considered a flight risk.

07:23.510 --> 07:26.479
We have three briefs ready
for pretrial hearings.

07:26.510 --> 07:28.102
Hello, Alicia.

07:28.140 --> 07:30.779
Alicia's recently been
named equity partner.

07:30.810 --> 07:32.471
Let's give her a hand.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.044
Thank you.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.719
Okay, so, we're good to
go on all three briefs.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.047
Everyone should pull on

07:38.090 --> 07:39.239
four or five more associates
get to those ready...

07:39.290 --> 07:40.609
Actually...

07:40.660 --> 07:42.150
Yes?

07:45.530 --> 07:47.225
Do we really need all three?

07:47.260 --> 07:50.491
The jurisdictional brief,

07:50.530 --> 07:52.498
it seems like...

07:52.540 --> 07:55.634
Well, it seems the same
as brief number two.

07:58.070 --> 07:59.571
Well, last time
we were together,

07:59.610 --> 08:01.168
we all thought
that was a good idea.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.973
Yes, and I'm wondering now
if it's a doubling of effort.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.918
Well, let's vote again.

08:09.950 --> 08:11.815
Who thinks
we should pull back on

08:11.850 --> 08:13.010
the jurisdictional brief?

08:13.060 --> 08:14.482
Just raise your hands.

08:20.960 --> 08:22.769
Maybe it's not
about dropping the brief.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.519
Is there any way we
could be more conservative

08:25.570 --> 08:26.798
in our approach to it?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.569
Sure.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.534
Do you want to
take charge of that?

08:32.940 --> 08:35.033
Okay, sure.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.308
ELSBETH:
He's playing keep-away.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.248
PERRO'I'I'I:
We are not withholding.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.271
ELSBETH:
Due course
passed a long time ago.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.242
We are
following the law.
No, no, no, that is not...

08:42.280 --> 08:44.248
That is right, we have
complied with every request...

08:44.290 --> 08:46.554
They clearly haven't
complied with every request

08:46.590 --> 08:47.887
or I wouldn't be...
Stop.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.582
Let us stop, please.

08:50.630 --> 08:53.622
Mr. Perrotti, this is not
justice by ambush.

08:53.660 --> 08:56.299
We must offer the defense
discovery here.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.161
_Once we have
it, Your Honor.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.861
But any premature release

08:59.900 --> 09:00.935
may damage our case.

09:00.970 --> 09:02.335
How would it
damage your case?

09:02.370 --> 09:04.031
JUDGE:
Counselor, please.
By allowing the defense

09:04.070 --> 09:05.059
_ to dissuade ou_r _
Witnesses from testifying.

09:05.110 --> 09:06.702
ELSBETH:
Excuse me, when did we...

09:06.740 --> 09:08.731
Ah, ah, ah.

09:08.780 --> 09:10.247
Mr. Perrotti,

09:10.280 --> 09:11.907
do you have
any reason for this charge?

09:11.950 --> 09:13.941
We have, Your Honor.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.244
We'd like to call
Mr. Frank Landau to the stand.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.787
And you were a witness
to Eli Gold purchasing votes?

09:20.820 --> 09:21.957
Yes.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.220
And you conspired with him?
Yes.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.751
And you had a pang of conscience
and you came to me?

09:26.800 --> 09:29.018
Yes.

09:29.060 --> 09:31.028
Hmm, and what
happened yesterday?

09:31.070 --> 09:34.164
LANDAU:
Eli Gold discovered that
I was going to accuse him.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.667
He showed up at my office.

09:35.700 --> 09:37.668
He was violent
and disruptive.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.132
PERRO'I'I'I:
Did you fear he might hurt you?

09:39.170 --> 09:42.742
Yes, he knocked my keys
from my hand.

09:42.780 --> 09:44.771
Oh, my God,
he knocked away your keys?

09:44.810 --> 09:45.708
Counselor, please.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.741
PERRO'I'I'I:
Your Honor,
the point is clear.

09:47.780 --> 09:49.714
Defense can't be trusted
with discovery,

09:49.750 --> 09:52.651
not at such an early
stage, anyway.

09:52.690 --> 09:54.180
Okay, that was my mistake.

09:54.220 --> 09:55.858
What does Landau
have on you, Eli?

09:55.890 --> 09:57.118
I don't know,
there's nothing.

09:57.160 --> 09:58.320
No scheme to buy votes?

09:58.360 --> 10:00.624
No, and if he says
there was, he is lying.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.367
Well, they need some kind of
corroboration to convict you.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.265
So we need to know what
he's going to say.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.938
And how do we do that?

10:06.970 --> 10:08.699
I don't know.

10:08.740 --> 10:09.764
We have to think.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.135
Yes?
What?

10:15.180 --> 10:17.102
You just had a thought.

10:17.150 --> 10:19.641
I think I did.

10:21.850 --> 10:23.147
Hello.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.681
The real estate office
is two doors down.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.652
Is this the
Democratic headquarters?

10:26.690 --> 10:27.816
Yeah.

10:27.860 --> 10:29.657
And you're Frank Landau?

10:29.690 --> 10:30.952
Yeah, why?

10:30.990 --> 10:32.719
You've been served.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.897
Oh, hell.

10:33.930 --> 10:36.194
What for?

10:36.230 --> 10:37.766
Defamation.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.960
Are you kidding me?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.036
I'm just the messenger.

10:41.070 --> 10:44.039
Damn it, Eli.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.389
So, I hear you want
our business.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.285
I want your business?

11:00.320 --> 11:03.118
The state's attorney's
business, our civil suits?

11:03.160 --> 11:04.923
Oh, yes, are you
on the committee?

11:04.960 --> 11:06.450
Don't sound
so surprised.

11:06.490 --> 11:07.923
That wasn't surprise,
it was awe.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.963
Here's our application--
please fill it out.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.399
We're starting to hear
pitches this afternoon.

11:12.430 --> 11:13.966
(sneezes)

11:14.000 --> 11:16.298
Aw, poor boy,
you have a cold.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.432
Ah, getting over it.

11:17.470 --> 11:18.437
And we'll be judged fairly?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.402
Why wouldn't you be?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.702
I don't know, we won

11:20.740 --> 11:21.775
a few cases against you.

11:21.810 --> 11:22.970
Oh, yes, well, we'll just have

11:23.010 --> 11:26.138
to overcome our_ bitterness
at your one-case Winning streak.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.317
(elevator bell dings)

11:27.350 --> 11:28.317
Alicia, good,
there you are.

11:28.350 --> 11:29.317
Do you have a minute?

11:29.350 --> 11:30.886
I do.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.889
Um, I need some help
with the Eli Gold case.

11:33.920 --> 11:36.821
Actually I don't think we can
help you in federal court.

11:36.860 --> 11:39.283
Yes-- oh, no, not that;
this is in civil court.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.798
Civil court-- how did this
end up in civil court?

11:41.830 --> 11:43.798
Well, it's in both courts,
actually. (chuckles)

11:43.830 --> 11:45.889
It's not as confusing
as it sounds.

11:45.930 --> 11:48.330
We're suing the-- ooh,
I like those earrings.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.860
Thanks.
So...

11:49.910 --> 11:50.865
We're suing the head

11:50.910 --> 11:53.378
of the Democratic
Committee for defamation.

11:53.410 --> 11:54.570
Why?

11:54.610 --> 11:57.875
He said some nasty things
about Eli in a gossip column.

11:57.910 --> 12:00.811
Okay, I don't understand
the connection.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.886
You know how hard it is
to win in defamation.

12:02.920 --> 12:04.410
Yes, we don't want to win.

12:04.450 --> 12:05.485
You don't?

12:05.520 --> 12:09.479
No, we want the defense
to ask for a dismissal.

12:09.520 --> 12:10.919
Then we'll be
able to put

12:10.960 --> 12:13.793
Frank Landau on the
stand in civil court

12:13.830 --> 12:15.229
to find out what
he intends to say

12:15.260 --> 12:16.921
against Eli in
federal court.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.268
It's not as strange
as it sounds.

12:19.300 --> 12:20.437
Really?

12:20.470 --> 12:21.937
(laughs)

12:21.970 --> 12:22.902
You're funny.

12:22.940 --> 12:23.907
(chuckles)

12:23.940 --> 12:26.534
So you'll help us?

12:26.570 --> 12:28.379
You want me
to playact a lawyer

12:28.410 --> 12:29.775
in your sham
defamation lawsuit?

12:29.810 --> 12:31.869
Pretty much, yes.

12:31.910 --> 12:33.969
This is not a sham,
Your Honor.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.909
We take the defamation
of our client very seriously.

12:36.950 --> 12:37.917
Their motive
is so nakedly obvious,

12:37.950 --> 12:39.440
Your Honor, it's almost comical.

12:39.490 --> 12:41.412
There is nothing comical about
the ruining of our client's...

12:41.460 --> 12:43.223
We strenuously insist
_ that this_ case be _
dismissed With prejudice.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.080
I can hear perfectly.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.950
Nobody needs to yell.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.422
Counselor, I've
read the petitions.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.098
This is third-
party defamation?

12:50.130 --> 12:52.018
Exactly-- Mr. Landau

12:52.070 --> 12:53.389
didn't print this comment.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.896
He didn't scream it
from the rooftops.

12:54.940 --> 12:55.736
Yes, because
he didn't have to.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.408
He was in a public place--
Parrillan--

12:57.440 --> 12:58.532
and he should have known

12:58.570 --> 13:00.276
his comments could
be ea5ily overheard.

13:00.310 --> 13:01.800
_ MARX:
She's right, Counselor.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.308
Third-party public declaration
is still defamatory.

13:04.350 --> 13:05.942
Are you arguing
for a dismissal?

13:05.980 --> 13:08.016
Yes, Your Honor, we move for
a dismissal with prejudice.

13:08.050 --> 13:10.041
PERRO'I'I'I:
No. (clears throat)

13:10.090 --> 13:12.217
Excuse me, sir,
do you have business here?

13:12.250 --> 13:13.979
I seem to now.

13:15.090 --> 13:15.784
You don't want
a dismissal.

13:15.820 --> 13:16.650
Your Honor,
the plaintiff asks

13:16.690 --> 13:19.284
to present witnesses
against this motion.

13:19.330 --> 13:23.528
Okay, what's going on?

13:23.570 --> 13:26.892
Mr. Perrotti is a Department
of Justice lavwer...

13:28.040 --> 13:30.929
...who wants to use
this defamation suit

13:30.970 --> 13:34.133
to fuel his prosecution
of our client.

13:34.180 --> 13:35.306
PERRO'I'I'I:
Wait a minute,

13:35.340 --> 13:36.944
just the opposite.

13:36.980 --> 13:37.947
You're with the Department
ofJusﬁce?

13:37.980 --> 13:38.947
I am, Your Honor.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.516
Good, well, then, shut up.

13:40.550 --> 13:42.415
Present your witnesses,
Counselor.

13:42.450 --> 13:44.987
ALICIA: We call Mr. Frank
Landau to the stand.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.009
Damn it.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.017
LAN DAU:
What?

13:47.060 --> 13:49.187
Did you say
the following, sir?

13:49.220 --> 13:52.383
"I know personally
Eli Gold was buying votes."

13:52.430 --> 13:54.159
I did.
And you still insist

13:54.200 --> 13:56.919
this was
not defamatory?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.028
I do.
And why is that?

13:58.070 --> 13:59.219
It's true.
Really?

13:59.270 --> 14:00.567
And how do you know
it's true?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.206
Your Honor,

14:03.240 --> 14:06.038
this testimony
will seriously undermine

14:06.070 --> 14:07.105
a current Department of Justice
investigation.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.005
We ask
that it be delayed.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.905
Mr. Perrotti...

14:10.950 --> 14:12.303
AUSA Perrotti.

14:12.350 --> 14:13.442
(chuckling):
Yes.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.641
You have no standing
in this court,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.148
and furthermore I don't like
the Department of Justice,

14:18.190 --> 14:20.613
so please sit down
and stop interrupting.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.049
Again, Mr. Landau,
how do you know

14:23.090 --> 14:24.978
this statement to be true?
I arranged the meeting

14:25.030 --> 14:27.157
for Eli to buy votes.
Any ideas?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.997
ALICIA: And with who_ did
you arrange this meeting?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.533
You must answer,
Mr. Landau.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.232
The meeting was with Hugh Saxon.

14:43.250 --> 14:47.038
And what is
Mr. Saxon's job description?

14:47.080 --> 14:48.570
He's CEO of Greengate
Retirement Centers.

14:48.620 --> 14:49.575
Are you crazy?

14:49.620 --> 14:51.941
That wasn't to buy votes.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.116
Mr. Gold, stop.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.081
ALICIA: And you
witnessed this meeting

14:54.120 --> 14:55.678
between Mr. Saxon and Mr. Gold?
LANDAU: Yes.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.278
Mr. Florrick's
mother was to speak

14:57.330 --> 14:58.683
at one of his
convalescent homes.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.357
ALICIA:
And in what way were
these votes bought?

15:00.400 --> 15:01.992
LANDAU:
Mr. Gold was worried

15:02.030 --> 15:03.122
that he wouldn't get
enough votes to make

15:03.170 --> 15:05.263
a strong enough showing at
the Democratic straw poll,

15:05.300 --> 15:07.461
so Mr. Saxon promised to
bus 600 senior citizens

15:07.500 --> 15:09.661
to the straw poll

15:09.700 --> 15:11.509
to pack the vote
for Peter Florrick--

15:11.540 --> 15:14.236
your husband.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.134
Alicia, do you mind
giving us a moment?

15:16.180 --> 15:16.942
I do, actually.

15:16.980 --> 15:18.299
This has nothing
to do with Peter.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.977
You packed the vote?

15:20.020 --> 15:21.373
I did what
everyone does, I...

15:21.420 --> 15:22.648
Wait a minute.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.342
No, Alicia, you may be subject
to subpoena in federal court.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.255
No, I enjoy attorney-
client privilege.

15:27.290 --> 15:28.257
Only if you have

15:28.290 --> 15:29.279
no previous knowledge of this

15:29.320 --> 15:30.685
as the wife of the candidate.
Peter doesn't know

15:30.730 --> 15:32.459
you packed the straw poll?
I didn't pack it.

15:32.490 --> 15:35.493
It was a Democratic outreach
to involve seniors

15:35.530 --> 15:38.169
in the process.
In trade for a discount

15:38.200 --> 15:39.098
on Greengate's
crisis management?

15:39.130 --> 15:41.098
Not in trade.

15:41.140 --> 15:43.108
Coincidentally,
at the same time.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.062
That's all.

15:46.640 --> 15:48.608
You didn't rein _in
your hours, AliCia.

15:48.640 --> 15:49.732
We're still_
working on it.

15:49.780 --> 15:51.338
Well, there are more
associates involved

15:51.380 --> 15:52.608
in the Bishop
case than before.

15:52.650 --> 15:53.639
You need to assert
your authority.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.740
I've gone over the work,
Diane, it's all necessary.

15:56.780 --> 15:57.747
Part of asserting
my authority

15:57.790 --> 15:59.985
is telling you that.
Well, here's another part.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.215
Find a way to cut ten percent
of their billable hours.

16:03.390 --> 16:05.381
(elevator bell dings)

16:09.760 --> 16:12.297
It's all right.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.199
You over your cold?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.775
Yes.

16:26.810 --> 16:28.448
You?

16:28.480 --> 16:31.142
Getting there.

16:32.190 --> 16:34.112
Alicia, it's okay.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.650
We're not gonna
act on it.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.282
Again.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.228
Yes, again.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.024
It was a mistake, it
happened, but that's it.

16:41.060 --> 16:45.565
We can't... avoid
each other.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.396
You're right.

16:46.430 --> 16:50.036
(elevator bell dings,
doors open)

16:50.070 --> 16:52.209
I'll see
you around.
See you.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.348
(doors close)

16:57.380 --> 16:59.348
MAN:
Yes, I met

16:59.380 --> 17:01.041
with Eli Gold.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.240
You're with his defense team?

17:02.280 --> 17:03.315
Iam.

17:03.350 --> 17:06.740
The prosecution says that
you met with Mr. Gold

17:06.790 --> 17:08.417
for the purposes
of voter fraud.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.280
I have an agreement
with the Department of Justice

17:10.330 --> 17:12.127
which prevents me from going
into these matters.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.024
Yeah,

17:13.060 --> 17:14.459
is that regarding
arranging transport

17:14.500 --> 17:15.694
for seniors staying
in your homes?

17:15.730 --> 17:17.561
Again, I really can't say.
All right, then,

17:17.600 --> 17:19.158
let me just say this.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.690
I think
that the Department of Justice

17:20.740 --> 17:22.537
is trying to scare you...

17:27.240 --> 17:30.277
This, um, this picture,

17:30.310 --> 17:32.699
this one here-- is that taken
from the straw poll?
Yes.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.240
Do you have any more

17:34.280 --> 17:35.247
from that day?

17:35.280 --> 17:36.542
We probably do.

17:36.580 --> 17:37.649
Why?

17:37.690 --> 17:38.782
PETER:
Hey, do you want

17:38.820 --> 17:40.310
to have dinner tonight?

17:40.360 --> 17:41.258
ALICIA:
What?

17:41.290 --> 17:43.429
Do you want to have
dinner tonight?
Why?

17:43.460 --> 17:46.657
What do you mean, why?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.226
No, I mean,
who with?

17:48.260 --> 17:50.797
Oh, no, not the campaign,
just us.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.290
What?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.368
A date?

17:58.410 --> 18:01.129
No, not a date,

18:01.180 --> 18:04.604
uh... just...

18:04.650 --> 18:06.641
Okay, a date.

18:09.350 --> 18:11.238
Okay.

18:11.290 --> 18:12.643
Good.

18:12.690 --> 18:16.182
You know that Jordan says
that if Maddie attacks me

18:16.220 --> 18:18.279
in tomorrow's debate,
that I should back off

18:18.330 --> 18:20.321
so that I don't
look like a bully.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.568
You think
that's smart?

18:23.600 --> 18:25.761
I think you should call Eli
and ask him.

18:28.370 --> 18:31.168
I haven't, uh, been
talking to Eli.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.371
I know.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.674
I think you should call Eli.

18:39.410 --> 18:42.311
We book over $55 million
in yearly client fees

18:42.350 --> 18:43.419
and we do this by providing

18:43.450 --> 18:45.247
individualized service.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.315
The primary reason we're
one of the few large firms

18:47.360 --> 18:49.316
left standing is
because we don't forget

18:49.360 --> 18:50.588
it's all about
the client.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.225
Now, I was told ten minutes, but
I could go on for another 30.

18:54.260 --> 18:55.659
You have any questions?
No, this is great.

18:55.700 --> 18:57.395
Good presentation.

18:57.430 --> 18:58.397
Thank you.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.362
Actually I have
a question.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.890
Ms. Hellinger.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.932
You represent the drug dealer
Lemond Bishop, don't you?

19:03.970 --> 19:05.437
I don't think we need
to go into that.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.801
Won't that prove
difficult,

19:06.840 --> 19:09.604
representing
Chicago's top drug dealer

19:09.640 --> 19:10.709
_ while at the _same
time representing us?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.638
Obviously there's always
a Chinese wall

19:12.680 --> 19:14.477
between the service
I would supply for you

19:14.520 --> 19:15.919
and the service
others in our firm

19:15.950 --> 19:17.417
would supply
for Mr. Bishop.

19:17.450 --> 19:18.644
Thank you,
very helpful.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.352
That's it, a
Chinese wall?

19:23.590 --> 19:27.458
Well, if we had to make other
adjustments, we'd be willing.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.456
Okay, thank you.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.365
ELSBETH:
Have you seen these photos

19:31.400 --> 19:32.958
before, Mr. Saxon?
SAXON:
Yes, I took them.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.867
And could you tell this court
what event is documented

19:35.900 --> 19:36.867
in these photos?

19:36.900 --> 19:38.663
Yes, the Democratic
straw poll

19:38.710 --> 19:39.529
four months ago.

19:39.570 --> 19:41.629
ELSBETH:
And you arranged
transportation

19:41.680 --> 19:44.205
for the seniors pictured here
to be at this straw poll?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.206
Yes.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.672
Now, the prosecution,

19:47.720 --> 19:50.883
in the form of the formidable
Mr. Perrotti--

19:50.920 --> 19:52.615
he has suggested
that this was

19:52.650 --> 19:55.312
an attempt to stack the deck
in favor of Mr. Florrick

19:55.360 --> 19:56.486
at this poll.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.329
Is that true?
No.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.658
Uh, as you can see, the
seniors involved voted

20:00.700 --> 20:01.997
for all three of
the candidates.

20:02.030 --> 20:04.498
You're referring
to their T-shirts?

20:04.530 --> 20:05.292
The shirts
represented

20:05.330 --> 20:06.968
which candidates they support?
Yes.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.366
Only a third of the seniors
voted for Mr. Florrick.

20:09.400 --> 20:10.560
Objection-- we don't
know how they voted.

20:10.610 --> 20:11.804
We just know what color
shirts they wore.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.832
That is_true as
far as it goes.

20:14.880 --> 20:18.805
Now, the prosecution...
Josh Perrotti--

20:18.850 --> 20:20.579
also has presented
a witness.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.349
This witness--
Mr. Landau--

20:22.380 --> 20:23.847
claims that you had
a deal:

20:23.890 --> 20:27.348
that Mr. Gold discounted
his services in trade

20:27.390 --> 20:28.880
for this transport
of seniors.
That is untrue.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.888
Your Honor,
Mr. Landau's testimony

20:30.930 --> 20:33.421
swearing to this supposed
conversation isn't enough.

20:33.460 --> 20:34.825
He needs
corroboration.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.725
Mr. Saxon was that
corroboration,

20:36.760 --> 20:38.364
and as you can see,
Mr. Saxon insists

20:38.400 --> 20:40.539
that conversation
never took place.

20:40.570 --> 20:43.937
Yes, Mr. Perrotti, we
are prone to dismiss

20:43.970 --> 20:46.461
this suit.

20:46.510 --> 20:50.776
Actually, Your Honor, Mr. Saxon
was not the only eyewitness.

20:50.810 --> 20:53.278
Really, who else?

20:53.320 --> 20:55.470
A witness I will
make available

20:55.520 --> 20:56.942
tomorrow, Your Honor.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.743
JACKIE:
My father used
to have dinner with him

20:58.790 --> 21:00.655
every night--
well, not every night.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.510
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick?

21:02.560 --> 21:04.482
Yes, hello. Do I know you?

21:04.530 --> 21:06.782
No, you don't, but you look
exactly like my grandmother.

21:06.830 --> 21:08.525
Really?

21:08.560 --> 21:11.723
Yes, and I'm sorry to say
this, but you've been served.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.432
Yeah, yeah, I agree.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.902
All right, well, hang in there.

21:21.940 --> 21:23.578
No, I'll be fine.

21:23.610 --> 21:25.305
We'll talk later.

21:28.120 --> 21:30.543
Hey, I'm ready.
(clears throat)

21:30.590 --> 21:31.784
Let me have it.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.082
Have what?

21:33.120 --> 21:34.712
Your phone.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.614
Are you feeling
threatened?

21:36.660 --> 21:37.684
No.

21:37.730 --> 21:41.826
No, but I do know that there
can only be one captain.

21:41.860 --> 21:43.054
Eli will tell you
the same thing.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.068
The surest way to
screw up a campaign

21:45.100 --> 21:46.863
is to listen to
two captains.

21:46.900 --> 21:47.969
Hmm.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.888
Do you trust me?

21:49.940 --> 21:53.330
Yeah.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.109
Then, give me
your phone.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.732
I trust you,
but I like my phone.

21:56.780 --> 22:00.045
Peter... you can't call Eli.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.746
Okay.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.685
Is this a courting,
a stalking or a...

22:11.730 --> 22:12.856
casual drop-by?

22:12.890 --> 22:13.925
What am I missing?

22:15.030 --> 22:17.692
(laughs):
What are you missing?
With the pitch.

22:17.730 --> 22:18.799
You were a little north
of hostile.

22:18.830 --> 22:22.596
You're joking, right?
Was this just
to show me up,

22:22.640 --> 22:24.938
bring me into the pitch so you
can cut me off at the knees

22:24.970 --> 22:26.506
in front
of Geneva Pine?

22:26.540 --> 22:29.008
Yep, that's me.
Well, thanks a lot.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.507
Are you really this dense?

22:30.550 --> 22:31.847
I got the message.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.677
Geneva Pine was against you.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.472
She wasn't against me until you
started asking your questions.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.408
She was being polite.

22:37.450 --> 22:39.441
That's why I was asking
the hard questions.

22:39.490 --> 22:40.650
She doesn't want
Lockhart-Gardner

22:40.690 --> 22:42.009
because you represent
a drug dealer.

22:42.060 --> 22:45.826
That's why I was asking--
I was giving you a chance.

22:45.860 --> 22:48.021
Butthanks
for your understanding.

22:53.170 --> 22:56.162
*

22:56.200 --> 22:58.009
Hello, Jackie.

22:58.040 --> 22:59.701
I don't think we should
be talking, Mr. Gold.

22:59.740 --> 23:02.470
Jackie, I need to know
if you're gonna...

23:02.510 --> 23:04.000
what you're gonna say.

23:04.050 --> 23:07.918
I'm going to tell
the truth, Mr. Gold.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.156
(phone beeps)

23:14.190 --> 23:16.613
Alicia, I could use your help.

23:16.660 --> 23:18.628
Yes. I am on my way right now.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.423
Mm-hmm. Bye.

23:20.460 --> 23:22.155
Got a second?
No.

23:22.200 --> 23:25.124
Got the revised
billing statement
on the Bishop case.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.126
You cut my hours?
It's coming
from the top.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.889
Forgive me, but aren't
you also a partner
on this case?

23:29.940 --> 23:31.567
Let's talk about
this later, Cary.

23:31.610 --> 23:32.907
Alicia, you cut my billables,

23:32.940 --> 23:34.077
it screws_ me _
come promotion time,

23:34.110 --> 23:37.170
and I prefer not
to have the rug yanked
out from under me

23:37.210 --> 23:38.609
a second time.
Right now

23:38.650 --> 23:40.675
let's just focus on
winning for Bishop.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.752
Jacqueline Florrick.

23:49.790 --> 23:51.155
You're the mother

23:51.190 --> 23:53.624
of current Cook County
State's Attorney
Peter Florrick?

23:53.660 --> 23:55.196
And future Illinois Governor

23:55.230 --> 23:57.596
Peter Florrick, yes.
Mm. Mrs. Florrick,

23:57.630 --> 24:00.497
on October 18, 2012,
did you give a speech

24:00.540 --> 24:02.565
in support of your
son's campaign

24:02.600 --> 24:04.704
to the residents
of the Greengate

24:04.740 --> 24:06.605
Retirement Center in Northbrook?

24:06.640 --> 24:08.505
Yes.

24:08.540 --> 24:10.872
Was Eli Gold
also present?
Yes.

24:10.910 --> 24:12.639
He arranged
for me to speak there.

24:12.680 --> 24:15.513
I'm sure he wanted to ensure
I stayed on pomt.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.211
PERRO'I'I'I:
At the reception afterwards,

24:17.250 --> 24:19.218
did you talk with Mr. Gold

24:19.250 --> 24:21.115
and Greengate
CEO Hugh Saxon?

24:21.160 --> 24:23.116
Why, yes.
And what was discussed?

24:23.160 --> 24:24.252
Arthritis.

24:24.290 --> 24:25.780
(laughter)

24:25.830 --> 24:27.798
I don't mean to be funny.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.151
Uh, the facility was
offering wonderful

24:30.200 --> 24:32.623
new therapy...
Was anything else discussed,
Mrs. Florrick?

24:32.670 --> 24:35.161
Well... Jewish stuff.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.237
"Jewish stuff."

24:38.270 --> 24:40.101
And-and what is
"Jewish stuff"?

24:40.140 --> 24:42.904
Mm, the Sabbath and-and a Seder.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.601
A Seder is a dinner.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.141
She's doing this
to get back at me.
For what?

24:47.180 --> 24:50.741
For everything.
PERRO'I'I'I: Was anything
of a political nature discussed?

24:50.790 --> 24:53.509
Actually, much of
a political nature

24:53.560 --> 24:56.916
was discussed, but
Mr. Gold doesn't like it
when I discuss politics,

24:56.960 --> 24:58.757
so often I just listen.

24:58.790 --> 25:02.590
When you were listening, did
you hear Mr. Gold and Mr. Saxon

25:02.630 --> 25:05.292
agree on a deal?
I don't know
ifI would

25:05.330 --> 25:06.592
call it a deal.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.836
They had an agreement.

25:07.870 --> 25:11.101
PERRO'I'I'I: Did Mr. Gold agree
to cut his crisis-management fee

25:11.140 --> 25:14.871
in return for Mr. Saxon
transporting Greengate reSIdents

25:14.910 --> 25:18.209
to the Cook County straw poll
to vote for your son?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.709
That sounds about right.

25:25.890 --> 25:28.051
We need to poke a hole
in what she heard.

25:28.090 --> 25:30.752
We could impeach her
as a witness.
How?

25:30.790 --> 25:32.257
Well, Jackie had
a stroke last year.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.224
She's had problems
with her memory and orientation.

25:34.260 --> 25:35.557
That's right.
Exactly!

25:35.600 --> 25:37.249
She's easily confused?

25:37.300 --> 25:39.097
Like a blind donkey.
ALICIA:
Butshe

25:39.130 --> 25:40.062
does not like it
being pointed out,

25:40.100 --> 25:42.068
so you have to be
very careful.
She also

25:42.100 --> 25:44.261
doesn't like me, 'cause I cut
down on her speaking schedule.

25:44.310 --> 25:45.868
And the
Jewish stuff?

25:45.910 --> 25:47.878
And the Jewish stuff.

26:02.390 --> 26:04.153
Looks expensive.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.282
It is.

26:05.330 --> 26:08.151
You don't know wine.

26:08.200 --> 26:11.328
You bought it 'cause
you like the picture
on the label.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.361
Pretty mountain.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.231
See the wagon?

26:15.270 --> 26:17.158
It's very lovely.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.269
Okay. I forgive you.

26:21.310 --> 26:23.949
I didn't know I was apologizing.
You were...

26:23.980 --> 26:26.175
in your own way.

26:27.880 --> 26:30.269
By the way, you...
you didn't get our business.

26:32.150 --> 26:34.311
You were cut
after the first round.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.686
You, uh...
you want your bottle back?

26:41.100 --> 26:42.897
No. Keep it.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.105
Hello, Mrs. Florrick.
Hello.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.677
You testified that you
gave a campaign speech

26:57.710 --> 27:00.076
at the Greengate
Retirement Center

27:00.110 --> 27:02.374
in Northbrook on October 18?

27:02.420 --> 27:04.411
Yes.
What specifically

27:04.450 --> 27:06.748
did you talk about
in this speech?
Objection.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.417
Relevance.
The alleged deal

27:08.460 --> 27:10.758
took place after a speech
by Mrs. Florrick.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.280
It's all part of a whole,

27:12.330 --> 27:13.649
Your Honor.
Yes,

27:13.700 --> 27:15.122
but the fact that Mrs. Florrick

27:15.160 --> 27:16.821
spoke about the retirement age
hardly matters.

27:16.860 --> 27:17.758
Objection,
Your Honor.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.688
If the counselor wants
to get on the stand,

27:19.730 --> 27:20.799
I'll swear him in.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.398
JUDGE:
Okay. You're both overruled.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.169
You can answer,
Mrs. Florrick.

27:24.210 --> 27:27.907
I spoke on the
retirement age

27:27.940 --> 27:29.669
and other things.

27:29.710 --> 27:33.077
ELSBETH:
Mrs. Florrick, you testified
that after your speech

27:35.750 --> 27:37.684
and Greengate CEO Hugh Saxon?

27:38.720 --> 27:40.688
If you say so.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.189
Yes...

27:44.230 --> 27:46.790
you said this, during
Mr. Perrotti's questioning.

27:46.830 --> 27:50.197
Well, I-I go to so
many of these events,

27:50.230 --> 27:52.425
for Peter, and, uh,
they-they all tend

27:52.470 --> 27:54.836
to blur into each other.
Mrs. Florrick,

27:54.870 --> 27:57.430
are you saying you don't
remember this meeting?

27:58.870 --> 28:00.906
I suffered a stroke

28:00.940 --> 28:04.478
several months ago,
and it's left me with, uh,

28:04.510 --> 28:07.445
shall we say...

28:07.480 --> 28:08.913
cognitive...

28:08.950 --> 28:10.349
issues.
Did you talk to her about this?

28:10.380 --> 28:12.280
No.
ELSBETH: Do you
recall if Eli Gold

28:12.320 --> 28:15.084
was even _at this event?
Objection.
Asked and answered.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.781
And the witness
may have erred

28:16.820 --> 28:17.957
in that earlier
testimony.
Overruled.

28:17.990 --> 28:20.129
Again, Mrs. Florrick,
do you recall

28:20.160 --> 28:22.094
if Mr. Gold was present
when you spoke

28:22.130 --> 28:23.392
at the Greengate
Retirement Center?

28:23.430 --> 28:25.068
Ms. Tascioni...

28:25.100 --> 28:28.035
there are days when I can't
even recall my own name.

28:29.270 --> 28:32.068
Thank you.
No more questions.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.168
So, why'd you do that?

28:41.220 --> 28:43.882
It's the truth, isn't it?

28:55.100 --> 28:56.499
(gavel banging)

28:56.530 --> 28:58.828
The issue on the table

28:58.870 --> 29:02.294
is whether there is
sufficient evidence

29:02.340 --> 29:04.365
to demonstrate Mr. Gold

29:04.410 --> 29:07.038
arranged and agreed to

29:07.070 --> 29:08.401
a vote-bribery deal.

29:08.440 --> 29:10.943
I was fully convinced there was,

29:10.980 --> 29:15.110
until Mrs. Florrick's admission
about her cognitive challenges.

29:15.150 --> 29:16.515
Which I'm afraid, Mr. Perrotti,

29:16.550 --> 29:19.212
leaves you with only
Frank Landau's testimony,

29:19.250 --> 29:22.117
and that is not enough
to bring to the jury.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.253
So we have no choice
but to disqualify...

29:24.290 --> 29:26.281
Your Honor, we wish
to amend out complaint

29:26.330 --> 29:29.788
Objection!
and add a new
coconspirator
to the charge.

29:29.830 --> 29:32.219
I know Mr. Perrotti
is highly competitive

29:32.270 --> 29:33.931
and aggressive

29:33.970 --> 29:36.393
and wants to assert himself,
but you were about to dismiss.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.136
Your Honor, you previously
approved our extension

29:39.170 --> 29:42.071
for the production
of our discovery.

29:42.110 --> 29:45.204
We submit that
the extension is
still in force.

29:45.250 --> 29:48.344
We ask merely
for the 24 hours.

29:50.280 --> 29:51.941
Granted.

29:51.990 --> 29:55.209
DIANE: We need to talk
about the Bishop case.

29:55.260 --> 29:56.454
Oh. We'll have

29:56.490 --> 29:59.186
all the motions ready
well before...

30:02.200 --> 30:04.828
I cut the hours.
You cut your hours.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.521
You were instructed to cut
the associates' hours.

30:07.570 --> 30:10.334
I thought we were trying
to keep the bill down.

30:10.370 --> 30:13.533
Does it make a difference
where the hours come from?
A conSIderable one.

30:13.570 --> 30:15.333
Clients like to
see partner hours.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.440
It reassures _them.
A disproportionate

30:18.480 --> 30:21.313
number of associate
hours leaves them to
wonder whether their case

30:21.350 --> 30:22.612
is _still
a priority.
The associates

30:22.650 --> 30:24.447
are the ones doing
all the heaw lifting.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.479
It doesn't seem right

30:25.520 --> 30:26.919
to penalize them.
They'll find

30:26.950 --> 30:29.418
other opportunities
to make up the hours.

30:35.460 --> 30:37.451
You're management now, Alicia.

30:37.500 --> 30:41.266
You're not_an associate--
stop pretending that you are.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.064
Will the other associates
grumble about you? Yes.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.600
But if you pretend
you're still their peer,

30:45.640 --> 30:49.030
they will grumble all the more,
and they will come to hate you.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.900
This is not the Queen's Hamlet.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.578
You cannot dress up
as a peasant here.

30:53.610 --> 30:55.339
So stop it.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.211
It is galling to them,

30:57.250 --> 31:00.242
and it is galling to me.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.586
WOMAN:
Did Saint Alicia

31:06.630 --> 31:07.995
sign off on the brief?

31:08.030 --> 31:10.123
I didn't get a chance
to show it to her.

31:10.160 --> 31:11.388
She's in with Diane.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.318
Any idea what they
were talking about?

31:13.370 --> 31:15.235
Probably other ways
to shaft us.

31:15.270 --> 31:18.137
She's been the golden girl
since the day she got here.

31:18.170 --> 31:21.071
(sighs):
Yeah, well, life lesson:
be nicer to her,

31:21.110 --> 31:22.532
so she doesn't cut our hours

31:22.580 --> 31:24.172
on the next case.

31:24.210 --> 31:25.905
Hi. Everything good in here?

31:25.950 --> 31:28.373
Yeah. Just plowing away
on the Bishop case.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.512
Good. Don't let up.

31:29.550 --> 31:33.338
By the way, the issue
with the bill has been resolved.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.618
Alicia cut her own hours

31:34.660 --> 31:36.389
instead of yours.

31:36.420 --> 31:39.651
But keep up the good work.

31:44.430 --> 31:47.490
(instrumental music plays)
MAN: All right, we're live
in 20 minutes.

31:49.340 --> 31:51.661
MADDIE:
Wrong Side.

31:51.710 --> 31:53.598
I believe
your group

31:53.640 --> 31:56.029
is going to be watching
from the other wing.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.401
Thank you.
It's not going
to work, you know.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.578
What's that?
Jordan...

32:01.620 --> 32:04.316
sent you over here to unsettle
me before the debate.

32:04.350 --> 32:05.339
It's not going to.

32:07.120 --> 32:09.281
(laughing)

32:09.320 --> 32:12.323
You know, they're always
wondering if men and women
can really be friends.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.726
But the real
question is:

32:14.760 --> 32:16.728
Can women?

32:16.760 --> 32:18.591
I mean, there's no question
that immigration

32:18.630 --> 32:19.995
is a complex issue.

32:20.030 --> 32:21.429
But let me just say this--

32:21.470 --> 32:24.200
we are Illinois,
not Arizona.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.662
MODERATOR: Thank you,
Mr. States Attorney.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.679
Oh, I'm sorry. I think,
according to your...

32:28.710 --> 32:31.201
pre-agreed rules, I'm supposed
to refer to you as

32:31.250 --> 32:33.445
Mr. Florrick.
That's all right, Petra.

32:33.480 --> 32:34.515
I won't hold it
against you.

32:34.550 --> 32:35.744
Thank you.

32:35.780 --> 32:39.989
And I'll let you
call me... Petra.

32:40.020 --> 32:43.456
Now, let's see. Ms. Hayward,
do you have any response?

32:43.490 --> 32:45.685
I do.

32:45.730 --> 32:48.198
(clears throat)
I am thrilled that
the state's attorney

32:48.230 --> 32:49.697
has found the Latino vote.

32:49.730 --> 32:52.619
Our state is only 16% Hispanic,

32:52.670 --> 32:56.436
and yet of the nearly 10,000
inmates of Cook County Prison,

32:56.470 --> 32:59.405
which you oversee,
36% are Hispanic.

32:59.440 --> 33:02.477
Wow. She's really
going after him.
Oh, he's doing fine.

33:02.510 --> 33:04.774
Well, those statistics tell
a very frightening story

33:04.810 --> 33:07.347
if you live
in Mr. Florrick's county

33:07.380 --> 33:08.642
and your skin is not white.

33:08.680 --> 33:10.409
How many of the lavwers

33:10.450 --> 33:12.338
working under you are
African-American, Mr. Florrick?

33:12.390 --> 33:14.449
Less than five percent.

33:14.490 --> 33:17.050
Yes, and that is a problem
which we are addressing...

33:17.090 --> 33:18.523
You were told about this lack
of diversity

33:18.560 --> 33:21.028
in a staff memo two years ago,
and you've done nothing.

33:21.060 --> 33:22.197
PETRA:
Thank you. Ms. Hayward...

33:22.230 --> 33:23.390
JORDAN:
How did she know that?

33:23.430 --> 33:25.421
From me.
She's using it.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.596
PETER:
...the question we were
addressing was immigration?

33:26.630 --> 33:30.031
I thought we were encouraging
a free range of topics here.

33:30.070 --> 33:31.435
PETRA: Whoa, whoa,
whoa. Everyone.

33:31.470 --> 33:34.337
Mr. Florrick, would you like
to respond to Miss Hayward

33:34.380 --> 33:36.029
on the issue _of
preferential hiring?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.105
No, thank you.

33:38.150 --> 33:40.539
Come on, Peter.

33:40.580 --> 33:42.571
We have just one more witness,
Your Honor.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.042
Good to hear, Counselor.

33:44.090 --> 33:45.387
We call Josh Perrotti.

33:45.420 --> 33:48.719
ATTORNEY:
We object
to this witness, Your Honor.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.216
Strenuously.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.386
The defamatory comments that

33:51.430 --> 33:53.057
Frank Landau made
about my client--

33:53.090 --> 33:55.399
they were made
to AUSA Perrotti.

33:55.430 --> 33:57.193
His testimony is
more than relevant.

33:57.230 --> 34:00.461
Your Honor,
the always-creative Ms. Tascioni

34:00.500 --> 34:02.730
is using this suit
to obstruct my federal case.

34:02.770 --> 34:05.238
Which is not my problem,
Mr. Perrotti.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.101
Here you're a private citizen

34:07.140 --> 34:08.573
who's out of order
in my court.

34:08.610 --> 34:12.307
The witness sounds perfectly
relevant to this case.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.113
Mr. Perrotti, come get a view
from the front.

34:14.150 --> 34:17.176
Enunciate. I want to
make sure he hears you.

34:17.220 --> 34:19.188
Oh, he will.

34:19.220 --> 34:21.108
MADDIE:
I will fight for you.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.650
That's what
your vote means to me.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.328
If you want someone
who's polite

34:24.360 --> 34:26.419
and calm, vote
for Peter, but

34:26.460 --> 34:28.599
if you want a fighter,
vote for me.

34:28.630 --> 34:29.756
PETRA:
Thank you, Maddie.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.267
Well, that brings us
to our halfway point.

34:31.300 --> 34:32.722
We'll take a short break now.

34:32.770 --> 34:36.433
This is the Illinois
Democratic gubernatorial debate.

34:36.470 --> 34:38.233
And we'll be right back.

34:38.270 --> 34:40.261
(instrumental music plays,
indistinct shouting)

34:42.540 --> 34:44.508
Oh, she's trying to bait you.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.609
You stick with the plan,
we'll be okay.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.174
Hmm. How am I doing?

34:48.220 --> 34:50.176
Mostly good.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.643
That's all we need
is mostly good.

34:54.660 --> 34:56.457
(whispering):
Tell me the truth.

34:56.490 --> 34:59.254
I don't know strategy,
but you need to call Eli.

34:59.290 --> 35:01.451
How much time
do I have?
Hey, Peter?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.456
Three minutes.
Peter? Peter, we need to talk.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.560
Jordan, I actually have
to ask you a question.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.561
(talking indistinctly)

35:12.340 --> 35:14.638
ELSBETH:
But isn't it true,
Mr. Perrotti...?

35:14.680 --> 35:16.170
You can call me Josh.

35:16.210 --> 35:21.170
But isn't it true,
Mr. Perrotti, that you failed

35:21.220 --> 35:23.643
to objectively prove
this vote-purchasing charge

35:23.680 --> 35:25.147
in federal court?

35:25.190 --> 35:26.384
For the moment.

35:26.420 --> 35:27.580
Time is irrelevant

35:27.620 --> 35:29.315
here, isn't it? You
either prove this...

35:29.360 --> 35:30.486
How bad?

35:30.520 --> 35:32.784
PETER:
Oh, well, clearly,
she's treating this debate

35:32.830 --> 35:34.320
like it's a game changer.

35:34.360 --> 35:35.918
Jordan wants me
to stick to policy

35:35.960 --> 35:37.450
and not push back.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.626
Ugh! You can't play
rope-a-dope, Peter.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.490
You bland out
when you don't punch.

35:40.530 --> 35:42.339
MAN:
_ Back in two
minutes, everyone.

35:42.370 --> 35:43.632
And don't let her near you.

35:43.670 --> 35:45.558
My guess is, she got the advice

35:45.610 --> 35:47.805
that she should stand near you
when you start bullying.

35:47.840 --> 35:49.376
Don't let her.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.378
Well, I can't have her
chasing me around the stage.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.275
Just be aware of the camera
frame. There are three cameras.

35:53.310 --> 35:54.641
Keep her from getting
in the frame with you.

35:54.680 --> 35:55.817
How do I do that?

35:55.850 --> 35:58.512
Walk the outskirts of the arena,

35:58.550 --> 36:00.518
closest to the bleachers.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.484
Sure...

36:03.520 --> 36:04.680
Okay?

36:04.730 --> 36:05.856
Your three minutes are up?

36:05.890 --> 36:06.925
Yeah.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.291
(sighs)

36:08.330 --> 36:09.752
I forgot how good
you are at this.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.462
Thank you.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.764
I really miss
having you run the show, Eli.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.598
ELSBETH:
You can't prove the federal
charges against Eli Gold...

36:17.640 --> 36:19.608
I know.

36:19.640 --> 36:21.608
Yeah, I... I miss you, too.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.528
(talking indistinctly)

36:23.580 --> 36:25.707
Okay. Good luck.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.274
Yeah. You, too.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.847
(phone beeps off)

36:29.880 --> 36:31.882
ELSBETH: _
...can't prove it
at this moment?

36:31.920 --> 36:33.547
PERRO'I'I'I:
Correct.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.251
And isn't it true
that Frank Landau

36:35.290 --> 36:37.679
was disqualified
as a coconspirator?

36:37.720 --> 36:40.257
Well, in the judge's opinion,
yes, but that doesn't make it

36:40.290 --> 36:41.621
any less true.

36:41.660 --> 36:42.729
(laughing):
Really? How is that?

36:42.760 --> 36:44.296
The federal
court has decided...

36:44.330 --> 36:45.467
No, it hasn't decided.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.320
It has left the
question open.

36:47.370 --> 36:49.588
Until you bring in
another coconspirator?

36:49.640 --> 36:50.789
Yes.

36:50.840 --> 36:53.434
And have you found
another coconspirator?

36:53.470 --> 36:55.631
Again, Your Honor,
this testimony is being used

36:55.680 --> 36:57.432
purely to shake me down.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.448
Again: that's awful.

36:59.480 --> 37:01.641
Please answer.

37:02.820 --> 37:05.414
Yes, I have found
another coconspirator.

37:05.450 --> 37:07.418
And who is that?

37:07.450 --> 37:11.819
Mr. Perrotti. Josh?

37:11.860 --> 37:14.021
I'm afraid you need
to cough up the name,

37:14.060 --> 37:15.891
or be held in contempt.

37:15.930 --> 37:17.557
Who is the new

37:17.600 --> 37:19.591
coconspirator?

37:21.570 --> 37:23.561
Diane Lockhart.

37:27.370 --> 37:28.803
Simply put,
Mr. Florrick has spent

37:28.840 --> 37:30.899
the last dozen years
being a politician.

37:30.940 --> 37:33.443
I've spent them building
and running a company.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.515
PETRA:
Thank you, Maddie.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.745
And thank you for staying
within your time limit.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.816
Mr. Florrick,
do you have anything here?

37:38.850 --> 37:41.387
Would you
like to pass?

37:45.330 --> 37:48.049
Mr. Florrick, you can bank
your time if you like.

37:48.090 --> 37:50.729
(quietly):
Come on. Come on. Come on.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.728
PETRA:
Mr. Florrick?

37:52.770 --> 37:57.594
Um, you know, you... you talk
about creating jobs, ma'am,

37:57.640 --> 38:00.302
but isn't it true that recently

38:00.340 --> 38:03.673
you closed your company's
semiconductor plant

38:03.710 --> 38:07.339
in Schaumburg and shipped
1,200 jobs to Mexico?

38:07.380 --> 38:08.677
We also opened
a distributing center in Aurora,

38:08.720 --> 38:09.744
creating 1,000 new jobs.

38:09.780 --> 38:12.749
60% of which are part-time
and don't see benefits.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.781
I... H... I don't think
that's exactly true.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.014
Oh, it is true.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.927
62.5, to be exact.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.622
Added to the 30% of your
employees recently furloughed...

38:21.660 --> 38:22.957
What's he doing?
He's trying to win.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.319
MADDIE:
They were furloughed

38:24.370 --> 38:25.564
because the economy was hit.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.090
Now that the economy
is coming back...

38:27.130 --> 38:28.597
You'll try to union-bust them.

38:28.640 --> 38:29.789
Excuse me.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.104
Last month, in a conference call
with Wall Street analysts,

38:32.140 --> 38:34.938
didn't you say
that within five years,

38:34.980 --> 38:36.834
you would drive the unions
from your plants?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.075
I did not...
That is not what I said.

38:39.110 --> 38:40.998
That is not what I said.
I said... I said,

38:41.050 --> 38:43.974
union costs,
union demands,

38:44.020 --> 38:46.341
were increasing costs and making
it difficult to be competitive.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.711
Uh, so it's okay
to cut your employees' wages

38:48.760 --> 38:51.058
while you renovate
your summer home on Lake Geneva?

38:51.090 --> 38:52.523
Petra, I believe
the audience member

38:52.560 --> 38:53.822
asked a question
about over-regulation,

38:53.860 --> 38:56.749
not... me.
PETRA:
Yes, but I believe

38:56.800 --> 38:58.722
we're encouraging
a free range of topics here.

39:04.770 --> 39:06.635
Diane Lockhart, senior partner
at Lockhart-Gardner.

39:06.670 --> 39:09.639
Ms. Lockhart, this is
a Lockhart-Gardner invoice

39:09.680 --> 39:11.500
to Greengate Retirement Centers.

39:11.550 --> 39:15.418
It includes a 25% discount
for Eli Gold's

39:15.450 --> 39:17.441
crisis management services.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.913
Would you please read
the handwritten initials

39:18.950 --> 39:20.087
at the bottom?

39:20.120 --> 39:21.553
D.L.
Hmm.

39:21.590 --> 39:22.557
You initialed this invoice?

39:22.590 --> 39:24.854
Yes. Will Gardner or I sign off
on every bill

39:24.890 --> 39:26.858
before it is
sent to a client.

39:26.890 --> 39:29.029
Hmm. Your Honor, Ms. Lockhart

39:29.060 --> 39:31.893
conspired with Eli Gold
to offer Greengate services

39:31.930 --> 39:34.125
at a discount. She's
the coconspirator.

39:34.170 --> 39:35.831
Your Honor, that is a stretch.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.758
Not at all.

39:37.800 --> 39:40.769
There are two ways to show
conspiracy-- the agreement

39:40.810 --> 39:43.734
of services received, and the
agreement of services offered.

39:43.780 --> 39:45.543
This is for services offered.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.172
We would agree.
Ms. Lockhart,

39:47.210 --> 39:49.940
did you approve Eli Gold's
25% discount to Greengate?

39:49.980 --> 39:51.709
No.

39:54.220 --> 39:56.552
You just testified
you initialed this invoice.

39:56.590 --> 39:58.854
Yes, but I didn't
approve it.

39:58.890 --> 40:01.791
I only signed off on it because

40:01.830 --> 40:02.899
my supervisor
instructed me to.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.467
I'm sorry. Aren't you
and Will Gardner the bosses?

40:05.500 --> 40:09.129
When this invoice came due,
our firm was in bankruptcy.

40:09.170 --> 40:11.730
We were under the control of
a court-appomted trustee,

40:11.770 --> 40:14.068
Mr. Clarke Hayden. He
was the one in charge.

40:14.110 --> 40:17.204
He was eager
to boost cash flow and

40:17.240 --> 40:19.140
_ had us offer clients
discounts for qUIcker payment.

40:19.180 --> 40:21.478
If Ms. Lockhart
did not approve

40:21.520 --> 40:22.839
that discount,

40:22.880 --> 40:24.438
it rules her out
as a coconspirator, Your Honor.

40:24.490 --> 40:25.912
No, the charge still stands.

40:25.950 --> 40:28.043
It will be amended
to reflect Lockhart-Gardner

40:28.090 --> 40:29.580
as the coconspirator...

40:29.620 --> 40:31.781
Yes, but the trustee,
Mr. Hayden, was an employee

40:31.830 --> 40:33.058
of the creditors,
not Lockhart-Gardner.

40:33.090 --> 40:35.058
Isn't that right,
Ms. Lockhart?

40:35.100 --> 40:36.897
It is.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.898
So, Mr. Perrotti,
are you going to continue

40:38.930 --> 40:40.818
to play musical coconspirators,

40:40.870 --> 40:42.861
or are we done here?

40:49.080 --> 40:51.036
Well done.

40:51.080 --> 40:53.048
Thank you.

40:53.080 --> 40:54.877
Do you like the ballet?
No.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.878
Me, neither.
Let's not go together.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.979
Dinner?

41:06.990 --> 41:08.150
No.

41:08.190 --> 41:10.158
May I ask why?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.758
No.

41:13.570 --> 41:15.629
(door opens)

41:15.670 --> 41:18.059
CARY:
You did right by us

41:18.100 --> 41:19.237
on those hours.

41:19.270 --> 41:20.806
Thank you.

41:20.840 --> 41:23.206
Do I want to know the names
I was called?

41:23.240 --> 41:24.901
(sighs)
Ugh.

41:24.950 --> 41:25.939
Let's just say,

41:25.980 --> 41:28.619
some of your fairy tale
favorites got some play.

41:28.650 --> 41:30.572
Well, you might want
to break 'em out again.

41:31.790 --> 41:33.644
My notes are in the margins.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.908
Don't worry about the preamble.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.019
I thought we were set.

41:39.060 --> 41:41.255
We were.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.258
I'll need the revised brief
tomorrow.

41:43.300 --> 41:44.927
No later than 10:00.

41:52.870 --> 41:54.838
PETER:
Well,

41:54.880 --> 41:59.305
polling says
that 56% of the viewers think

41:59.350 --> 42:01.238
that I won the debate.

42:01.280 --> 42:03.248
It's probably a couple
of points higher.

42:03.280 --> 42:04.816
They always under-sample
younger voters.

42:04.850 --> 42:06.283
No landlines.

42:06.320 --> 42:09.050
You're still packing.

42:10.090 --> 42:12.684
I'm still damaged goods.

42:12.730 --> 42:15.290
Well, I want you back.

42:15.330 --> 42:16.297
Kresteva will use this.

42:16.330 --> 42:18.321
Ugh! Kresteva will use anything
and everything.

42:18.360 --> 42:20.920
You can't be sentimental,
Peter.
(laughs)

42:20.970 --> 42:22.961
You think that's sentimental?

42:24.770 --> 42:26.761
How about this?

42:31.280 --> 42:33.248
Thank you.

42:33.280 --> 42:35.840
You're welcome.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.014
Well, are you gonna stay?

42:40.050 --> 42:41.312
Because I don't see myself

42:41.350 --> 42:43.318
getting to Springfield
without you.

42:43.360 --> 42:45.749
Or Washington?

42:46.790 --> 42:48.792
Or Washington.

42:53.270 --> 42:55.636
Okay, I'll stay.

42:55.670 --> 42:58.730
Good. Now, unpack all that crap,
and let's get to work.
