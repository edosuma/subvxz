00:11.010 --> 00:12.721
[Policeman] Watch the port side.

00:12.804 --> 00:14.848
Eyes on that tanker! Pour it on!

00:14.931 --> 00:17.434
[creaking]

00:19.269 --> 00:21.146
[sailors yell]

00:22.605 --> 00:24.149
[Nathan] The police chatter was right.

00:24.232 --> 00:26.568
That accidental explosion's
causing this ship to capsize.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.904
[Ricardo] Then we have to get everyone out
before the fire hits the fuel tanks.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.489
[yells]

00:33.700 --> 00:34.993
[yells]

00:43.376 --> 00:45.920
-That looked like the Flex Fighters.
-Those traitors.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.714
They probably caused
this explosion.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.093
I don't like this "saving the day
and getting no credit" stuff.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.596
People should love me.

00:54.679 --> 00:56.056
Us.

00:56.139 --> 00:58.641
We're not heroes
for the popularity, Omni-Mass.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.393
Saving people is hard enough,

01:00.477 --> 01:03.146
but saving people in secret 'cause
they think you're a public menace?

01:03.229 --> 01:04.689
That's bananas.

01:04.773 --> 01:05.774
[ringtone]

01:06.900 --> 01:09.986
Oh, come on! Five missed calls from Erika?
What?

01:10.070 --> 01:12.155
Oh, no. We were supposed
to hang out tonight.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.657
I have to... I just... I can't...
[groans]

01:16.117 --> 01:19.746
Wingspan's not taking
this undercover hero thing so well, is he?

01:19.829 --> 01:23.583
-The stress is gonna kill him.
-Not if Erika does first.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.837
[bell rings]

01:28.922 --> 01:31.174
Do I even wanna know?

01:31.257 --> 01:34.135
My little brother took my pants
by accident, so I had to wear his.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.512
You think anyone's gonna notice?

01:35.595 --> 01:38.389
Everyone is currently noticing,
right now.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.183
[chatter, laughter]

01:42.310 --> 01:44.020
Erika! Erika!

01:44.521 --> 01:45.772
Erika, wait up!

01:45.855 --> 01:49.109
Oh, were you calling me?
Sorry I didn't respond.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.362
Just like you didn't respond
last night for hours.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.780
What's the excuse this time?

01:53.863 --> 01:57.700
-I was...
-Never mind. I don't care.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.703
Can my life get any worse?

02:00.787 --> 02:02.038
Ow!

02:02.122 --> 02:06.960
You, my insensitive colleague,
have caused me to lose face with Erika.

02:07.043 --> 02:10.046
I challenge you

[Dr Dreamscape] Though this may be the
first time I've ushered the enlightenment

02:53.047 --> 02:58.761
of my physical self to Charter City,
its truth has always called to me.

02:58.845 --> 03:02.015
And that is an example
of why we let the Cosmos

03:02.098 --> 03:04.350
get to know who we really are.

03:04.434 --> 03:08.021
Because only then
can she introduce you to her friend,

03:08.104 --> 03:09.939
the Universe.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.444
Take time to discover
what the Universe wants.

03:14.527 --> 03:18.615
Then the Universe can seek
to discover what you want.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.366
[people] Oh, yes.

03:20.992 --> 03:23.828
I hope you found your answers,
but more importantly,

03:23.912 --> 03:25.705
I hope you found yourself.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.960
-Excuse me, brother...
-Ben Lenard.

03:31.044 --> 03:34.839
Mr. Lenard, I believe the Universe
has more in store for you.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.049
[twinkling sound]

03:43.389 --> 03:46.935
It's almost 3:00.
So am I really supposed to duel Gabe?

03:47.018 --> 03:50.855
He called you out, man.
But come on, it's Gabe.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.274
I know. I can fly circles around him.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.860
But the whole school would
know I'm a wanted Flex Fighter,

03:55.944 --> 03:57.278
public enemy number one.

03:57.362 --> 04:01.115
Technically, you're public enemy number
three. You have to throw the fight.

04:01.199 --> 04:03.868
Then the whole school is gonna think
Gabe can beat me.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.372
-Jake, help me out here.
-Huh? Sorry.

04:07.455 --> 04:10.208
There was another
strange bank robbery last night.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.294
<i>I'm the manager.</i>
<i>Why would I rob my own bank?</i>

04:13.378 --> 04:15.046
Crazy, right?

04:15.129 --> 04:18.299
My life is falling apart!
Can we focus here?

04:18.383 --> 04:21.719
-Sorry. How can I help?
-I'm tired of all the secrets.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.680
Hiding from the public,
lying to my family,

04:23.763 --> 04:25.306
throwing this fight with Gabe...

04:25.390 --> 04:28.017
It's too much. I need someone
I can be honest with.

04:28.101 --> 04:32.438
I wanna tell Erika about,
you know, the thing...

04:32.522 --> 04:33.564
It's this stuff.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.109
There's a reason
it's called a "secret identity."

04:36.192 --> 04:38.945
And there's the minor detail
that you're a wanted criminal.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.823
Show yourself, miscreant!

04:41.906 --> 04:43.157
[pupils gasp]

04:46.202 --> 04:47.829
[groans]

04:49.372 --> 04:51.207
Fencing. Seriously?

04:51.291 --> 04:56.587
I must prove to my love that
she has chosen the incorrect suitor.

04:58.047 --> 05:01.092
-I'm not the one fighting you.
-You're his Second.

05:03.511 --> 05:06.180
Your job is to check the weapon
and give it to him.

05:06.806 --> 05:10.476
"Lord, what fools these mortals be!"

05:11.311 --> 05:14.188
-Throw the fight?
-Throw the fight.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.859
On guard.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.784
[grunts, yells]

05:28.119 --> 05:28.953

05:59.692 --> 06:01.277
[ringtone]

06:03.362 --> 06:06.908
-Duty calls.
-Of course it does.

06:10.411 --> 06:11.370
You're late.

06:11.454 --> 06:14.916
Sorry, but Wingspan
was busy dueling for his honor.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.542
I'm not even being sarcastic.

06:16.626 --> 06:19.754
-So what's up? Is it Rook?
-Potentially.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.465
There's been a series
of bank robberies around town.

06:22.548 --> 06:23.841
I've been following them too.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.219
All of the banks were robbed
by people who worked there.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.305
People with no motive
and no memory of the robbery,

06:29.388 --> 06:31.557
as if they were being
manipulated by someone.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.685
These five locations are the
banks that have been robbed.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.648
These three are in the same vicinity.
I believe one of them will be next.

06:38.731 --> 06:44.570
Split up, observe and report back.
Simply collect data. Do not get involved.

06:49.700 --> 06:50.535
Got anything?

06:50.618 --> 06:53.287
[Ricardo]<i> I saw a couple of</i>
<i>preschoolers with more fighting skills</i>

06:53.371 --> 06:55.081
<i>-than Nathan had today.</i>
-[Nathan]<i> Not cool!</i>

I can't believe after the day
I've had, you're gonna...

06:58.417 --> 07:00.086
Someone's going into the bank.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.880
<i>Just watch. Don't engage.</i>

07:02.964 --> 07:05.925
<i>Wouldn't want them to beat you</i>
<i>down, like Gabe did.</i>

<i>[Ricardo laughs]</i>

Omni-Mass? Watch this.

07:10.596 --> 07:12.932
[Ricardo]<i> What? No! No, don't!</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:18.646
Sorry, pal, bank's closed.

07:21.482 --> 07:25.403
You'll regret having seen this.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.327
Ahh.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.165
[guards grunt]

07:37.248 --> 07:38.916
Okay, maybe I shouldn't have engaged.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.252
I really don't wanna fight
other good guys.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.504
[guards groan]

07:44.297 --> 07:47.425
"Simply collect data."
Was that not clear enough for you?

07:47.508 --> 07:51.888
-I admit, this wasn't my best idea.
-Oh, but it was.

07:53.097 --> 07:56.559
I thank the Cosmos
for placing you in my path.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.692
Uh, guys?

08:09.572 --> 08:10.781
Snap out of it, guys.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.451
That weird dude has you under
some kind of mind control.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.834
What? Huh?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.754
You don't wanna beat me up anymore?

08:24.837 --> 08:28.007
I thought you were robbing the bank,
and we had to stop you.

08:28.090 --> 08:31.010
Isn't he that Dr. Dreamscape
dude? Why is he here?

08:31.093 --> 08:33.429
Were you robbing the bank?
I'm so confused.

08:33.513 --> 08:39.644
I was not robbing the bank. But what
I was doing was saving the day.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.729
[Kane]<i> Secure the perimeter.</i>
<i>Delta Team, go.</i>

08:41.812 --> 08:43.397
Kane! Run!

08:46.817 --> 08:48.194
[weapons power up]

08:53.491 --> 08:56.160
I have no idea how I got here.

08:57.662 --> 09:01.249
-I know you said not to engage, but...
-You did the right thing.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.918
-Wait, what?
-Was Dr. C just nice?

09:04.001 --> 09:06.170
Dr. Dreamscape
is clearly the kind of villain

09:06.254 --> 09:07.964
that could have brought this city down.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.716
With his mere touch,
he can take control of any person

09:10.800 --> 09:12.218
and make them do his bidding.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.263
Who knows what he would have achieved
if you hadn't stopped him?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.809
[bell rings]

09:22.562 --> 09:23.479
Erika, wait.

09:24.230 --> 09:29.318
-Nathan, I've got class.
-This is more important. Trust me.

09:31.821 --> 09:36.325
-Seriously, I can't be late.
-Please, I just have to get this out.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.620
[sighs] I know I keep flaking
and don't return calls,

09:39.704 --> 09:42.290
and it seems like I don't care,
and this sounds crazy,

09:42.373 --> 09:45.209
but the real reason isn't because
I'm an insensitive jerk.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.337
It's because I'm a Flex Fighter.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.257
Wingspan.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.260
The flying one.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.596
Wow!

09:56.679 --> 09:58.514
That explains everything.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.100
The strange hours,
the secrets, the weirdness.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.854
Yeah, yeah. Then you know why
I couldn't tell you. I'm really sorry.

10:04.937 --> 10:09.692
Sorry? Nathan, you're a hero
to the entire city.

10:09.775 --> 10:12.069
I knew I could trust you.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.115
So, what are you doing after school?

10:16.198 --> 10:18.576
Do you have to go fight
a super villain or something?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.036
Right now? No.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.956
Well, I'm working the Cat Circus,
but I can get you in for free.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.083
Great. Then...

10:26.167 --> 10:27.710
[ringtone]

10:27.793 --> 10:29.462
[groans]

10:29.545 --> 10:32.840
-I have to go.
-I get it. Go be a hero.

10:32.923 --> 10:37.928
The Cat Circus will still be here
after you save the world. And so will I.

10:41.015 --> 10:43.517
Although I can't access
Rook's security cameras,

10:43.601 --> 10:48.230
I was able to tap into the radio frequency
they use on their comms.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.565
[Kane]<i> We aren't sure who he is,</i>

10:49.649 --> 10:51.734
<i>and he has plans that</i>
<i>endanger Charter City further.</i>

10:51.817 --> 10:55.154
[Rook]<i> -Further?</i>
<i>-Dr. Dreamscape could be a global threat,</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:56.864
<i>even from our holding cells.</i>

10:56.947 --> 11:00.201
It appears Dr. Dreamscape's
plans are a bit more ambitious

11:00.284 --> 11:01.827
than just bank robberies.

11:01.911 --> 11:03.788
This is Admiral Vogel.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.499
The military is in Charter City
to meet with Rook.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.918
Something about experimental technology.

11:09.001 --> 11:11.712
Admiral Vogel has recently gone missing.

11:11.796 --> 11:16.092
If my hypothesis is correct,
that Dr. Dreamscape is in control of him,

11:16.175 --> 11:19.261
then that villain
has access to those weapons,

11:19.345 --> 11:22.598
and he's going to hold
Charter City for ransom.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.149
Nice ride Dr. C gave you, guys.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.902
Too bad you don't have
natural soaring abilities.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.405
I liked you better when you were
having a bad day.

11:47.206 --> 11:50.084
[sailor] Admiral Vogel!
Admiral Vogel, sir! Let us in!

11:50.167 --> 11:51.585
Admiral Vogel!

11:51.669 --> 11:54.422
No matter what you may have
heard about us, we're here to--

11:54.505 --> 11:57.550
The Admiral's sealed us all out.
He's about to take control of the weapons.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.761
If you can help, I don't care
what anyone says about you.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.889
Back up.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.307
[grunts]

12:08.436 --> 12:10.855
This weapons vault
is impossible to break into.

12:11.480 --> 12:15.276
Admiral Vogel, can you hear me?
You have to concentrate!

12:15.359 --> 12:16.777
Admiral Vogel!

12:16.861 --> 12:18.487
[beeping]

12:18.571 --> 12:21.031
Can you hear me? Wingspan!

12:21.115 --> 12:24.368
You have to concentrate!
Wingspan!

12:25.578 --> 12:28.956
Dr. Dreamscape's been controlling you
ever since you went into the bank!

12:35.171 --> 12:36.338
Wake up!

12:47.975 --> 12:50.978
Wingspan, you've gotta fight
his mind control!

12:51.061 --> 12:53.731
Who knows what
Wingspan's seeing right now?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.948
-Even my blades aren't making a dent.
<i>-It wouldn't matter if they did.</i>

13:03.032 --> 13:06.952
Dr. Dreamscape has total control of
Wingspan in the physical world.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.788
<i>Not only did he use Wingspan</i>
<i>to fly himself to this ship,</i>

13:09.872 --> 13:12.708
<i>he's manipulating him</i>
<i>to access the weapon codes.</i>

13:12.791 --> 13:14.335
<i>If there's any chance to save him,</i>

13:14.418 --> 13:16.921
<i>you'd have to somehow</i>
<i>go into his dream state.</i>

13:17.004 --> 13:18.380
Say what now?

13:18.464 --> 13:19.673
I've been researching.

13:19.757 --> 13:23.802
Jay Michaels, aka Dr. Dreamscape,
is a low-level telepath

13:23.886 --> 13:26.096
who's been apparently
chemically altering himself

13:26.180 --> 13:27.723
to boost his abilities.

13:27.806 --> 13:30.976
Each city he visits coincides
with a string of robberies.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.979
In each case, the victims say
they felt like they were dreaming.

13:34.063 --> 13:37.399
<i>You need to go into Wingspan's</i>
<i>mind and wake him up.</i>

13:37.483 --> 13:39.151
And we do that how?

13:39.235 --> 13:42.196
<i>Your suits track all of your vitals,</i>
<i>including brain waves.</i>

13:42.279 --> 13:44.073
<i>Blindstrike carries knockout gas.</i>

13:44.156 --> 13:47.326
<i>If I can send a pulse through your suits</i>
<i>the instant you go unconscious,</i>

13:47.409 --> 13:50.579
<i>your comm systems might allow you</i>
<i>to share subconscious delta waves</i>

13:50.663 --> 13:52.122
<i>and enter the dreamscape together.</i>

13:52.206 --> 13:55.376
Wait, you want us to go into
Wingspan's nightmare brain?

13:55.459 --> 13:57.545
<i>I agree it is a massive risk.</i>

13:57.628 --> 14:00.422
<i>If it doesn't work, you could end up</i>
<i>trapped in the dreamscape</i>

14:00.506 --> 14:01.799
<i>for the rest of your lives.</i>

14:01.882 --> 14:04.426
Our best friend
is about to blow up the city.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.803
We don't have a choice.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.429
[gas hisses]

14:12.560 --> 14:14.311
<i>[humming]</i>

14:21.652 --> 14:24.321
Jake! I've been waiting for you.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.448
Mom?

14:27.491 --> 14:28.909
Wanna help with those trees?

14:29.577 --> 14:31.579
You're better at details than me.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.668
[car]<i> Agent Perez, your parents</i>
<i>are being held captive</i>

14:37.751 --> 14:39.086
<i>at the Charter City Auditorium.</i>

14:39.169 --> 14:42.172
<i>You have to save them</i>
<i>before the show starts.</i>

14:42.256 --> 14:44.842
Let's do this, super car.
Hold on, girls.

14:44.925 --> 14:45.759
[girls giggle]

14:45.843 --> 14:47.011
[engine roars]

14:49.680 --> 14:50.931
[tires screech]

14:52.224 --> 14:53.517
[beeping]

14:59.315 --> 15:00.900
[crowd cheers]

15:05.571 --> 15:09.617
-Son, don't worry about us.
-No way. We're family.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.578
[taps tempo]

15:12.661 --> 15:13.662
[rock music]

15:14.914 --> 15:16.707
[shreds on guitar]

15:22.296 --> 15:23.923
[feedback]

15:41.523 --> 15:43.442
[sword resonates]

15:49.740 --> 15:50.616
[spooky sound]

15:52.368 --> 15:53.327
Huh?

15:57.206 --> 15:59.917
Was anyone else having
the most awesome dream ever?

16:00.000 --> 16:03.712
I saw my mom. You, Blindstrike?

16:06.882 --> 16:09.510
Hey, Wingspan! Over here!

16:09.593 --> 16:11.095
[echoing cry]

16:12.346 --> 16:14.682
Do you hear that distant cry?

16:14.765 --> 16:18.268
It's the sound of the Cosmos,
denying your heart's desire.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.436
Let him go.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.690
Oh, I would, but the Universe
has other plans for me.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.651
Robbing banks like a petty crook
is my gone-self.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.904
Controlling governments
is my now-self.

16:28.988 --> 16:33.909
That's why the Cosmos gifted me
a real superhero to control.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.203
It's time I make my own dreams
come true.

16:43.836 --> 16:47.339
It's naively cute to believe you
can defeat me in the dreamscape.

16:47.423 --> 16:51.051
[distorted] For this is my realm,
and I reject you.

16:52.302 --> 16:55.514
Can we go back to where I was
a secret agent with a sick ride?

16:55.597 --> 16:58.684
-I could kick his butt there.
-That's because it was your dream.

16:58.767 --> 17:02.104
And this is Wingspan's.
Dr. C said only he can stop it.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.278
[yells]

17:11.905 --> 17:12.906
No!

17:14.491 --> 17:15.784
[grunts]

17:25.544 --> 17:26.545
[grunts]

17:30.507 --> 17:31.633
What?

17:32.843 --> 17:34.219
[grunts]

17:37.765 --> 17:39.641
[laughs menacingly]

17:39.725 --> 17:43.937
You two, keep Dreamscape occupied
so I can get to Wingspan.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.732
Agent Perez on the case.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.942
The dreamscape doesn't want you.

17:49.026 --> 17:52.654
If you were wise, you would
abandon this lost path.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.159
In your dreams, pal.

17:57.242 --> 18:00.454
No. In your nightmares.

18:12.382 --> 18:15.636
[laughs]

18:17.638 --> 18:21.308
Wingspan, you need to wake up
so we can get outta here.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.811
What, wake up? What are you
talking about?

18:23.894 --> 18:27.189
Look around. Does this look like
Charter City to you?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.149
Uhh...
Kinda.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.360
[they groan]

18:31.944 --> 18:34.822
[whistling, rumbling]

18:35.614 --> 18:38.158
Don't listen to him.
He's simply jealous.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.787
He wants to take away all that eternity
has bestowed on you.

18:41.870 --> 18:46.500
They all do. But we're so proud.
You're our favorite Flex Fighter.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.419
You're the real hero here,
not these losers.

18:49.503 --> 18:51.505
Come on, man! It's not real!

18:51.588 --> 18:53.215
Nathan, let's go.

18:53.298 --> 18:56.260
Leave your jealous friends
and let's see a movie or something.

18:56.343 --> 19:00.013
Nathan, we can't beat him
without you! We're a team!

19:00.681 --> 19:01.849
Nathan...

19:03.392 --> 19:07.062
I told Erika who I was because
the truth is always better than a lie.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.439
But I haven't told my mom
or my sister yet.

19:09.523 --> 19:12.109
None of this is real.
Is it, Dreamscape?

19:13.443 --> 19:18.240
Of course it is, Wingspan.
Just let me guide your dreaming.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.200
This is my dream, my rules.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.120
Know your limitations, rube.

19:25.122 --> 19:26.373
[groaning]

19:32.504 --> 19:33.630
[cries]

19:35.591 --> 19:39.887
Yeah, so that's terrifying.
How do we get outta here?

19:39.970 --> 19:41.638
Pinch me?

19:41.722 --> 19:42.723
Ow!

19:44.641 --> 19:46.226
[grunts]

19:57.613 --> 19:59.823
This has been a weird day.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.745
I don't impress easily, Stretch,

20:04.828 --> 20:07.122
but what you all managed
to face about yourselves,

20:07.206 --> 20:08.582
in a subconscious state,

20:08.665 --> 20:12.586
means that you are stronger
than even you realize.

20:12.669 --> 20:13.670
[melancholy music]

20:16.548 --> 20:17.633
[button clicks]

20:20.969 --> 20:22.346
[plays haltingly]

20:23.138 --> 20:24.681
[groans]

21:01.260 --> 21:03.637
Ugh. You have 90 seconds.

21:03.720 --> 21:06.765
I know I've been a jerk,
but there's a really good reason.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.351
I was afraid to tell you the truth,
but now I'm not.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.770
I'm a Flex Fighter.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.982
Wingspan. The flying one.

21:16.316 --> 21:19.653
-I know it's a lot to take in, but--
-You're a wanted criminal.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.905
How could you think that's okay?
