WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:07.924
[cell door slams]

00:08.717 --> 00:10.051
[theme song playing]

00:57.098 --> 00:58.850
[cell door slams]

01:14.699 --> 01:16.618
[cell door slams]

01:25.043 --> 01:28.213
Come on, already. Do something.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.260
[sighs]

01:46.147 --> 01:47.440
[sighs heavily]

01:57.325 --> 01:59.160
[Alvarez] What the hell is this?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.496
What happened? Did I miss it?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.373
Miss what?

02:03.456 --> 02:04.457
Oh, the illegal cage match

02:04.541 --> 02:07.085
that you orchestrated
between two mortal enemies?

02:07.168 --> 02:10.171
Relax. Nothing happened anyway.

02:11.089 --> 02:15.093
[sighs] It's not about outcome, Ginger.
It's about cheating.

02:15.760 --> 02:16.928
Oh.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.973
Yeah? Well, then you should have
thought of that

02:20.056 --> 02:24.769
before all you guys got together
to unload the two biggest duds on me.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.522
You have two seconds to let them out

02:27.605 --> 02:30.275
before I have you banned
from Fantasy Inmate for life.

02:32.652 --> 02:33.486
[sighs]

02:35.864 --> 02:38.616
Shame there's no points
for unlikely animal friendships,

02:38.700 --> 02:42.453
'cause I'm pretty sure the old bird
and the old bat kissed and made up.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.499
I am going to kill that bitch.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.918
My sister thought we made a truce.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.588
[chuckles] Dumb cunt.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.507
I'm gonna take out Barb
and her whole block.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.301
I would have done it right there,

02:56.384 --> 02:59.679
but that guard was all over us
the whole time. Never looked away once,
like some perv at a peep show.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.894
You know,
I think it's better this way, anyways.

03:05.977 --> 03:11.107
Play it cool, take our time,
plan it right.

03:11.190 --> 03:14.027
When Barb's least expecting it, we pounce.

03:15.028 --> 03:18.323
Like a middle-aged mogul
on a college intern.

03:18.406 --> 03:22.577
So we're gonna take out our dicks
and jerk off on 'em? [chuckles]

03:24.120 --> 03:25.997
This is not a joke, Badison.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.461
This... is...

03:31.544 --> 03:33.129
War.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.883
[Linda] Mmm, I like this piece
of dark chocolate.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.010
Definitely a yes.

03:39.093 --> 03:43.348
So, how many COs do you need
for this little video of yours anyway?

03:43.431 --> 03:46.768
[sighs] This little video is a key part
of our corporate rebranding.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.978
Oh, I'll want to shoot
some of our inmates too.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.772
Sorry, we don't do that anymore.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.106
[chuckles]

03:52.190 --> 03:54.901
Cute. I'll, of course,
want to audition them first,

03:54.984 --> 03:56.527
in case they come off as serial killers.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.615
Actually, you want the serial killers.
Sociopaths tend to be really good actors.

04:00.698 --> 04:04.661
Just give me some of your better inmates
in an assortment of colors.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.246
One Benetton ad coming up.

04:06.829 --> 04:09.707
I used to love their sweaters
in high school.

04:09.791 --> 04:14.504
Speaking of fashion,
the COs will be wearing these.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.466
Seriously, this is how
you plan to fix MCC's PR crisis?

04:18.549 --> 04:20.343
With branded dickhead caps?

04:20.426 --> 04:23.096
MCC does not exist anymore.
We are PolyCon now.

04:23.179 --> 04:26.808
So, you shoot a video, slap on a new name

04:26.891 --> 04:30.561
and no one remembers
your shoddy workforce started a riot?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.563
It's so much more than that.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.900
I've been working
on our vertical integration for months.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.444
And thanks to PolyCon's
new PQ tracking software,

04:38.528 --> 04:42.031
I've already increased
our profit margins by 12%.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.199
"PQ"?

04:43.783 --> 04:46.119
Prisoner quotient score.
Read your emails, Natalie.

04:46.202 --> 04:49.080
You were supposed to input PQs
for all of your inmates weeks ago.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.125
It's a work in progress,
minding my p's and q's.

04:52.208 --> 04:53.710
Well, it better be.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.795
Because we're making big changes
around here.

04:55.878 --> 04:59.424
I need your entire prison population
ranked and on my desk in 36 hours.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.183
How'd I think
I could get into business school

05:09.267 --> 05:12.353
when all of my accomplishments
are full-on felonies?

05:13.730 --> 05:14.647
[sighs deeply]

05:14.731 --> 05:17.734
What? I'm being ridiculous, I know.
I'm being ridiculous.

05:17.817 --> 05:20.403
-Piper.
-What? I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.738
What's going on with you?

05:23.573 --> 05:25.616
Nothing. Would you believe me
if I said that?

05:25.700 --> 05:28.202
No, I would not.
Explain your weirdness.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.620
Badison's trying to steal my date.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.623
At first, I thought
that she was all talk, but...

05:34.292 --> 05:35.668
[whispers] this happened.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.087
-Is that...
-Heroin? Yes.

05:38.171 --> 05:42.050
Okay, that's heroin
and that is your hiding spot?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.302
I'm going to fucking kill her.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.971
No. See? This is why
I didn't want to tell you.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.556
Because I knew you'd wanna help.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.433
-Piper...
-I can handle this.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.894
It's under control.
I have a plan.

05:52.977 --> 05:56.814
Better than your current plan of hiding
a baggie of heroin under your leg?

05:56.898 --> 05:59.442
I'm going to go to a friendly CO. I'm gonna explain the situation,
turn over the drugs

06:03.071 --> 06:08.409
and ask for them to put me in Ad Seg
for my own protection.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.204
Or you can flush the fucking baggie
and be rid of it.

06:11.287 --> 06:14.791
Oh, Badison's a textbook bully.
That's how she stays in power.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.585
Well, it's definitely not
her winning personality.

06:17.668 --> 06:23.091
This baggie is the only proof I have
of what Badison is doing to me.

06:23.174 --> 06:25.802
And I think she took my toothbrush
and shoved it up her ass.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.011
[chuckles]

06:27.095 --> 06:32.183
Piper, I love you,
but you're really bad at plans.

06:32.266 --> 06:34.227
You're gonna show this to some magical CO

06:34.310 --> 06:35.895
-and he'll believe you?
-[knock at door]

06:35.978 --> 06:38.815
You're in the wrong cell, Vause.
That's a shot for each of you.

06:38.898 --> 06:44.195
Oh, look, Piper,
another friendly CO doing his job.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.286
[indistinct chatter]

06:55.206 --> 06:56.499
[indistinct murmuring]

07:04.132 --> 07:06.134
-Is it done?
-What?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.969
What else? Frieda.

07:08.052 --> 07:09.512
Nah, it didn't work out.

07:09.595 --> 07:13.266
We can't waste time worrying about her
right now. We got bigger fish to fry.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.436
Frieda's not a fish.
She's our white whale.

07:16.519 --> 07:19.272
She could stand to lose a few,
but I wouldn't go that far.

07:19.355 --> 07:22.316
You are the poster child
for American ignorance.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.069
And you're an old cunt
who needs to piss off.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.447
Carol, please, we have to talk.

07:27.530 --> 07:31.451
Preferably someplace not in earshot
of Whitey Bulger's love child.

07:31.534 --> 07:34.203
Dang it, woman,
you got borscht on the brain?

07:35.079 --> 07:38.458
Frieda's yesterday's news.
We're planning a war here.

07:50.219 --> 07:53.473
[clears throat] Barb, welcome back.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.434
Sit down, Nicky. Sit down.

07:56.517 --> 07:58.811
-We got something important to tell you.
-Uh-oh.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.732
[grunts] Important either means
you're gay, getting divorced,

08:02.815 --> 08:03.900
or the dog is dead.

08:05.067 --> 08:08.237
Unless this one's coming out as straight.
I'd recommend a new haircut.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.991
We are going to war with C-Block.

08:13.201 --> 08:17.288
Oh. Uh, that seems awfully extreme.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.374
Anyone think of trying diplomacy?

08:20.458 --> 08:24.253
There have been too many fuckups lately.
Too many.

08:25.421 --> 08:29.008
We've let ourselves get sloppy and weak.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.552
Those Cunt-Blocks need to know who's boss.

08:31.636 --> 08:35.223
And you three gals
are my troop leaders on the front lines.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.308
Sure hope nobody's got flat feet.

08:37.391 --> 08:41.395
I have high arches
and the reflexes of a feral cat.

08:42.188 --> 08:43.272
That's terrifying.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.651
Can we just focus up here, ladies?

08:46.734 --> 08:51.489
I need you three to go out there
and recruit me some more soldiers.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.658
Stronger and meaner they are, the better.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.746
Some people think
that brains are more important than brawn.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.916
Not after they get their heads staved in
with a shovel.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.417
Then they aren't saying shit.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.838
Whatever we can use in a fight,
we want it.

09:08.839 --> 09:10.883
And please, don't skip over the new girls.

09:12.009 --> 09:15.304
We gotta give those cookies
a chance to earn their stripes.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.722
Ain't that right, Nicky?

09:18.516 --> 09:19.934
[chuckles]

09:34.949 --> 09:36.617
-[Fig] There you are.
-[machine beeping]

09:38.911 --> 09:41.998
Uh... my shift doesn't start
for another ten minutes.

09:42.081 --> 09:44.166
Follow me. We need to talk.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.591
We've got a problem,
or more accurately, you do.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.095
Whatever's in there isn't mine.

09:56.178 --> 10:00.766
Is now. They're inmate files
and there are six more boxes of them.

10:00.850 --> 10:04.770
Apparently PolyCon wants them entered
into this new computer system,

10:04.854 --> 10:09.150
so they can generate some kind of
master list with everyone's rank on it.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.612
Kind of like high school, except no one
goes to Dartmouth when it's done.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.904
How am I supposed to rank them?

10:13.988 --> 10:17.617
[chuckles]
You're just the data entry monkey.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.369
The algorithm does the work.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.622
Calculating good behavior,
severity of crime,

10:22.705 --> 10:25.249
whether an inmate picks her nose or not.
All relevant bullshit.

10:25.333 --> 10:30.087
[chuckles] That's great! I'll send some
guys down to grab the rest of the boxes.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.798
Shit, if knew you'd be so excited
about data entry,

10:32.882 --> 10:34.508
I would've had you do my Christmas cards.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.344
[chuckles]

10:41.557 --> 10:44.769
[all chanting]
I said, amen. D-Block kickball's here.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.438
There must be some Jesus
in the atmosphere.

10:47.521 --> 10:48.898
-[Maria] Yo!
-I said, amen.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.151
-Listen! Can you give it a rest? Please!
-D-Block kickball's here...

10:52.234 --> 10:54.487
-I can't concentrate with the yelling.
-[chanting stops]

10:54.570 --> 10:56.489
Maybe if you'd let the Lord
back into your heart,

10:56.572 --> 10:57.990
you'd have an easier time focusing.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.077
Maybe if you shut the fuck up
I won't cut your ass off the team.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.996
Let's just say a silent prayer
for our sister, Maria.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.041
Yeah, go for it, I'm sure Jesus
is real invested in our kickball.

11:07.124 --> 11:08.668
Like he ain't got nothing else to do.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.046
-[ball bursts]
-[McCullough] Oh, Christ! Fuck!

11:12.671 --> 11:14.298
[inmates laughing]

11:14.382 --> 11:15.466
[Maria] Huh.

11:15.549 --> 11:17.885
All right, inmates.
That's it, practice is done for today.

11:17.968 --> 11:18.844
We just got here.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.137
Can't you get another ball?

11:20.221 --> 11:23.224
You heard me.
Everyone back to your blocks.

11:23.307 --> 11:26.018
-[inmate 1] That's not fair.
-[inmate 2] It's our time to be outside.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.938
-Settle down. Everyone settle down.
-[all clamoring]

11:29.021 --> 11:30.481
Everyone settle down!

11:30.564 --> 11:33.234
This is our time to be exercising outside.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.652
Everyone on the ground now!

11:36.737 --> 11:38.656
That's some bullshit.
We didn't do nothing.

11:38.739 --> 11:42.034
Shut the fuck up!
All of you, shut your fucking mouths!

11:42.118 --> 11:46.122
Hey, hey. Shit, McCullough.
Somebody needs to take a chillaxative.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.585
We should talk later. Maybe I can
help you with some of that excess energy.

11:52.628 --> 11:56.048
Let's go, inmates!
Back to your cages. Now!

11:59.844 --> 12:00.970
[inmate mumbling]

12:01.053 --> 12:02.888
What's that, inmate?

12:05.516 --> 12:07.143
[breathing heavily]

12:12.148 --> 12:13.607
[indistinct chatter]

12:15.818 --> 12:17.528
For those of you who are interested,

12:17.611 --> 12:21.615
tryouts for the corporate video
are starting now in the multipurpose room.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.918
Sorry. I'm not cutting...
I'm not gonna go in.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.964
Hey, hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

12:37.047 --> 12:41.135
Relax, Chapman, I'm sure you're gonna make
the cut. They're short on white girls.

12:43.220 --> 12:46.640
Great job, Arwin.
Thank you! You too!

12:48.851 --> 12:51.479
[quietly] It's not about the video.
It's Badison.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.608
She keeps doing things to me
to try to give me extra time.

12:55.691 --> 12:58.235
I know the only reason I can come to you

12:58.319 --> 13:00.654
is because people like me
get a pass from authorities,

13:00.738 --> 13:02.948
which is on the one hand horrifying,

13:03.032 --> 13:06.952
but on the other...
maybe will work in my favor.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.121
At least I hope it does because...

13:10.372 --> 13:16.962
[whispers] I need you to transfer me
to Ad Seg so Badison can't steal my date.

13:19.089 --> 13:24.678
If I were you, I'd stop living in fear
and start running towards the problem.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.973
Spend more time with Badison.
Really get to know her.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.310
Maybe she's not as bad as you think.

13:31.393 --> 13:33.103
It's like Dr. Phil says,

13:33.187 --> 13:35.731
"Enemies are friends
you just haven't hugged yet."

13:47.910 --> 13:48.953
[knocks at door]

13:49.036 --> 13:50.538
What do you think you're doing?

13:50.621 --> 13:53.082
My pedicure place was all booked, so...

13:53.165 --> 13:55.709
I'm talking about
you stealing Piper's date.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.961
[chuckles]

13:57.044 --> 13:59.755
You think I want
that bitch in here longer?

13:59.838 --> 14:03.259
You know she makes chewing sounds
in her sleep?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.470
I guess you do know that.
Maybe you like that.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.265
Oh, shut up, Badison.
I'm not fucking around.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.267
Oh. [chuckles]

14:11.350 --> 14:14.687
Chapman must have a USDA prime-cut puss

14:14.770 --> 14:17.940
at the rate you're willing
to step in front of bullets for her.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.277
Look at you...

14:22.403 --> 14:27.074
trying to <i>My Fair Lady</i> yourself for her
with higher education.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.368
It beats a lifetime career
as a second-rate thug.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.370
"Second-rate"?

14:32.496 --> 14:35.374
Tell that to the girls I got
sitting in the SHU right now.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.794
Or the two I got transferred
to that piss-hole down in Kentucky.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.421
And last year, there was this chick--

14:40.504 --> 14:42.590
I don't care about your résumé.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.343
I am asking you, as a human being,
to leave Piper alone.

14:46.427 --> 14:51.181
Problem is, your girlfriend mouthed off
to me in front of my crew.

14:51.974 --> 14:56.812
And if I let her get away with it,
the whole system starts to fall apart.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.148
Like District 12 in <i>Hunger Games.</i>

14:59.231 --> 15:02.443
I get it.
You have to reestablish dominance.

15:02.526 --> 15:06.113
Maybe there's some other lesson you can
glean from a Jennifer Lawrence film

15:06.196 --> 15:08.240
that doesn't involve
Piper getting extra time.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.076
Yeah, I could. Yeah, but...

15:12.077 --> 15:13.412
[chuckles]

15:13.495 --> 15:18.500
I... don't... like her.

15:21.003 --> 15:27.301
However, I might be willing to call off
Piper's very unfortunate incident report

15:27.384 --> 15:31.180
if you agree to start working for me.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.515
[sighs] That's never gonna happen.

15:33.599 --> 15:36.268
What's the matter? You don't wanna
work for the big boss?

15:36.352 --> 15:41.774
Oh, please. Carol's the big boss.
You're a fucking child.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.987
Well, I guess you two
will have a few more years

15:47.071 --> 15:49.907
to lez it up together in Château Max.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.034
Which, in a way,
is like I'm doing you a favor.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.911
If I learned anything
from Katniss and Peeta,

15:53.994 --> 15:56.830
that long-distance
relationship shit sucks.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.916
Watch another movie, Badison.

16:02.586 --> 16:06.215
PolyCon doesn't care about people.

16:06.298 --> 16:09.510
[grunts] Sorry, my bad. Give me a sec.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.101
PolyCon doesn't just care about people.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.770
People are their bottom line.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.897
[chuckles]

16:22.731 --> 16:23.941
"Bottom." [chuckles]

16:24.024 --> 16:29.196
With a world-class staff
and over 100 educational programs...

16:29.947 --> 16:32.491
I'm sorry, are they calling
the book cart I push around

16:32.574 --> 16:35.786
100 educational programs?
'Cause I haven't seen shit.

16:35.869 --> 16:40.207
Before serving time,
I thought I didn't have a future.

16:40.290 --> 16:42.167
Now I know when I get out...

16:43.502 --> 16:48.007
Oh. Who am I kidding? I know
I have no future. I barely have a present.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.677
Now I know when I get out,
I'm staying out.

16:51.760 --> 16:54.722
"PolyCon is reducing...

16:55.389 --> 16:56.849
reshitavision"?

16:56.932 --> 16:58.434
[Linda] Recidivism.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.061
Reshitavism.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.147
If you want crappy things
to stop happening to you,

17:03.230 --> 17:06.734
then you have to stop accepting crap
and do something more!

17:06.817 --> 17:08.944
-Can you stay on script, please?
-[Suzanne] Oh.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.322
That was <i>Grey's Anatomy.</i>
Cristina Yang says it to Meredith.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.200
Well, can you stay on my script?

17:17.953 --> 17:19.455
Thanks, PolyCon!

17:19.538 --> 17:21.540
Thanks, PolyCon.

17:21.623 --> 17:24.251
Uh, you wanna try smiling
when you do that?

17:24.334 --> 17:25.836
Nope.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.464
I don't need to see anybody else.
You got the part.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.591
-For real?
-No.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.342
Get out of here and stop wasting our time.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.219
[exclaims]

17:34.303 --> 17:36.430
I need a coffee. Or four.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.143
[grunts] God, I'm ready
to eeny-meeny-miny-moe this shit

17:41.226 --> 17:43.937
whenever you are, so...
[blows raspberry]

17:45.314 --> 17:49.693
Jesus, I ain't ever seen nobody
spend so much time in their room

17:49.777 --> 17:52.154
since my brother got pubes.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.117
You better stay out there
or the guards'll be up our asses.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.453
The COs leave me and my friends alone.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.414
You see?

18:03.165 --> 18:04.917
You in the right block now.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.713
But just so you know,
there's a war that's about to go down.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.635
I thought you might want in,
'cause you got all that beef with C-Block.

18:14.718 --> 18:15.761
What are you talking about?

18:15.844 --> 18:19.014
D-Block versus C. Kickball.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.059
Barb's got everyone gearing up.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.728
Those pills must be really messing
with your head

18:24.812 --> 18:28.023
if you think that I want to fight
in a fucking gang war.

18:28.107 --> 18:32.194
[shushing] Calm down. Calm down.
I'll just tell her to leave you out.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.155
No. Tell her to stop. Tell somebody.

18:35.239 --> 18:38.826
Daya... people could get killed out there.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.954
-That's kind of the point.
-Oh.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.206
So now you're this big gangbanger, huh?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.625
No, only when I need to be.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.044
How did that work out for you
last time, Scarface?

18:49.878 --> 18:52.005
Things are different for me in here.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.467
You think I don't see you
chasing after that Daddy chick

18:55.551 --> 18:57.886
like a lost little puppy dog?

18:58.762 --> 19:03.433
You need to wake up, Daya, okay?
Before you get hurt.

19:03.517 --> 19:08.730
Mmm-hmm. Yo, you wanna sit this one out?
That's on you.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.901
But if you tell anybody about this,
I won't be able to protect you.

19:15.779 --> 19:19.658
This isn't camp, <i>mami.</i>
In here, I take care of you.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.126
Uh, Sylvia... Good morning. Hey, wait up.

19:29.209 --> 19:32.254
Mr. Caputo.
If we'd known you'd be in town,

19:32.337 --> 19:34.047
we wouldn't have
prerecorded your testimony.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.801
I'm sorry. I thought I was moving,
but it didn't work out.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.721
I'm not sure the live show
would've gone any better.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.181
You did what you could.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.933
So, um, how is it looking for her?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.811
Based on the information you gave us,

19:47.895 --> 19:49.897
we were able to hire
another medical examiner

19:49.980 --> 19:53.317
and her report contradicts
the prosecutor's. That's promising.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.735
What does that mean for Taystee?

19:55.319 --> 19:58.822
Hard to say. Jurors usually glaze over
when presented with medical reports.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.366
But if you had to give me the odds?

20:01.450 --> 20:03.702
[chuckles softly]
It doesn't work like that.

20:03.785 --> 20:06.246
For Christ's sake,
I'm asking for a ballpark here.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.081
The kid's life is on the line.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.836
[sighs] I'm very sorry.
I'm a little emotional. Uh...

20:15.380 --> 20:18.550
-Honestly, I'd say 50-50.
-Shit.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.970
No, that's good. Coin-toss odds are good.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.514
But there's a lot
riding on her testimony tomorrow.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.726
If Taystee can make the jurors
feel compassion for her,

20:27.809 --> 20:30.854
then we may have a shot
at winning this thing.

20:31.855 --> 20:32.773
If she doesn't?

20:33.482 --> 20:35.859
Let's hope she does.
Do you mind?

20:36.777 --> 20:37.861
Please. Sorry. [exhales]

20:42.241 --> 20:45.619
Fuck those bitches for making McCullough
lose her shit like that.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.579
What they did to you in the riot
was bad enough.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.123
You can't let 'em fuck up
the rest of your life too.

20:50.207 --> 20:51.500
What happened?

20:51.583 --> 20:54.628
McCullough freaked out on the yard.
Riot PTSD.

20:54.711 --> 20:58.382
Far as I'm concerned,
all those twats should get the chair.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.217
New York does not have the death penalty.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.927
Yeah, but this is federal.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.639
-Still extremely rare.
-That's a real goddamn shame, then.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.141
Especially 'cause the one who
organized the thing, Jefferson,

21:08.225 --> 21:09.851
her trial started.

21:10.769 --> 21:11.770
Any word how it's going?

21:12.688 --> 21:16.191
Yeah, that one's a friend of yours.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.443
Was. Back in the day.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.529
[Dixon] They want
to give Jefferson a fair trial,

21:20.612 --> 21:23.991
they should stand her up there naked,
shove a baton up her ass,

21:24.074 --> 21:26.535
and then lock her in a tiny room
that smells like shit.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.245
I think we already do that last part, bro.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.248
Whatever. The baton should go up her ass.

21:31.832 --> 21:34.793
Shit, Dixon. Ever hear of the high road?

21:34.876 --> 21:38.046
Just paying 'em back for what they did
to us. Fuck the high road.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.508
Whose side are you on, anyways?
Ours or your little BFF?

21:41.591 --> 21:44.344
Yeah, I told you,
Jefferson and I aren't friends anymore.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.096
But she's still a person.

21:46.179 --> 21:47.639
No, she ain't.

21:47.723 --> 21:51.601
And the second you start seeing
those animals like that, you're fucked.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.519
True.

21:54.062 --> 21:56.773
But there are some good ones
here and there.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.443
Well, this Jefferson bitch
sure as fuck ain't one of 'em.

21:59.526 --> 22:00.819
Her ass is gonna fry.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.946
And me and you will have front row seats.

22:03.030 --> 22:05.824
I swear, Dixon, we're gonna be so close,

22:05.907 --> 22:09.202
we'll be able to smell
her back fat sizzle like bacon.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.712
[sighs]

22:20.964 --> 22:21.882
[grunts]

22:21.965 --> 22:23.300
[sniffles]

22:24.134 --> 22:25.177
[sniffing]

22:25.886 --> 22:28.555
Hello? Is someone in here?

22:34.352 --> 22:37.522
[grunts] Wheatly,
if that's you smoking again,

22:37.606 --> 22:39.274
you know you owe me ten bucks.

22:45.405 --> 22:47.324
-What the fuck?
-Shit.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.451
My, God! Fuck!

22:49.534 --> 22:53.163
Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

22:53.246 --> 22:55.457
It's fine. Don't worry about it.

22:58.585 --> 23:00.420
Heard they shook you out there.

23:00.504 --> 23:04.257
No. That was on me, not them.

23:05.342 --> 23:08.553
Doesn't seem like
you forgive and forget so easy.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.263
-[toilet flushes]
-[door opens]

23:14.017 --> 23:15.685
Forget? [scoffs]

23:19.564 --> 23:22.776
I wake up in sweat puddles
from nightmares every night.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.240
I jump if I hear a loud noise.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.911
[sighs]

23:34.996 --> 23:37.833
And I will never fucking forgive them.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.293
I mean, shit,
if I'd had a gun on me in that yard,

23:40.377 --> 23:43.171
I would have mowed them down
without thinking twice about it.

23:44.214 --> 23:48.426
[grunts] But those girls were just excited
about playing kickball.

23:49.803 --> 23:52.389
They are horrible people who have hurt me,

23:53.223 --> 23:56.143
and they're regular people
who just want to play a game.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.729
Or get through the day. Or feel human.

24:01.439 --> 24:04.568
And I just get so messed up
when I can only see the horrible,

24:04.651 --> 24:07.237
which is pretty much all the time.

24:09.322 --> 24:13.535
But I don't know how to exist in the world
with so much hate inside me.

24:21.126 --> 24:22.127
Thanks. [sighs]

24:40.645 --> 24:41.897
Hey.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.275
Brought you some snacks
from the vending machine.

24:45.358 --> 24:49.237
Wasn't sure if you liked sweet or salty,
so I got you one of each.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.781
I ain't hungry.

24:53.867 --> 24:56.369
I heard they hired a new medical examiner.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.789
That should be good for your case, right?

25:01.291 --> 25:02.375
I guess.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.341
Taystee, I know
what you're going through is rough.

25:10.217 --> 25:12.552
But even if you're not feelin' it,
you gotta turn it on now.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.681
Hey, you gotta let them meet

25:16.765 --> 25:20.518
the smart, funny, caring,
full-of-life Taystee.

25:21.519 --> 25:23.688
The Taystee who deserves to be free.

25:24.773 --> 25:29.361
The Taystee that makes up
spontaneous rap songs about badminton.

25:29.444 --> 25:32.197
It was croquet because
it rhymes with Kanye.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.324
See that? That's what I'm talking about.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.663
How am I supposed to
get a bunch of strangers

25:39.746 --> 25:43.416
to care about me
when my own friend don't give a damn?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.837
Don't nobody give a damn about me.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.465
Jesus.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.386
I quit my job over you.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.182
All those people
in the gallery every day...

26:00.517 --> 26:02.602
they care what happens to you too.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.188
[sniffling]

26:05.814 --> 26:07.357
I bet you even Cindy does.

26:09.025 --> 26:12.320
Who knows what went on
behind the scenes with her?

26:14.990 --> 26:16.241
[Taystee exhales heavily]

26:16.324 --> 26:18.285
You think this is what Poussey
would have wanted?

26:20.078 --> 26:22.914
That's right. I said her name.

26:23.748 --> 26:25.709
I should have said her name.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.046
Taystee, you still got a chance.

26:30.130 --> 26:35.385
What you say on that stand tomorrow
matters a lot.

26:35.969 --> 26:39.431
So you gotta get in there and
you gotta fight like hell for yourself,

26:40.140 --> 26:41.975
just like you did during the riot.

26:44.811 --> 26:46.104
Who knows?

26:49.941 --> 26:52.902
Maybe that jury will surprise you.

26:56.197 --> 26:59.117
But they're not gonna get the chance
if you've already given up.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.332
Tell me you haven't given up.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.875
[crying]

27:11.880 --> 27:13.923
-[inmate] What the fuck?
-Time's up.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.597
Yo, Hell-man...

27:22.974 --> 27:24.476
wanna earn a quick three-hundy?

27:25.226 --> 27:27.729
I can only fit eight grams in one burrito.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.481
If I start bringing in two burritos,

27:29.564 --> 27:31.649
it'll look suspicious
on account of I'm not a fat-ass.

27:31.733 --> 27:36.071
This ain't about drugs.
I need you to dirty up Chapman's record.

27:38.239 --> 27:39.157
How dirty we talking?

27:39.866 --> 27:42.077
Mmm. Maybe you catch her
making brass knuckles

27:42.160 --> 27:45.038
out of an old Preparation H tube?

27:45.121 --> 27:48.833
Or find a dime bag of weed in her cooch?
Dealer's choice.

27:48.917 --> 27:53.755
So long as she gets, uh, another, say,
two, three years.

27:54.547 --> 28:00.136
I'll take your money,
but, uh, I also want something else.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.265
[chuckling]

28:04.349 --> 28:07.477
It's been a while
since I choked on a chubby,

28:07.560 --> 28:09.938
but it's like riding a bike, no?

28:10.021 --> 28:15.276
Yeah, a fat, leaking, flesh-bike
that rams into your tonsils.

28:16.277 --> 28:19.322
-It's all coming back to me now.
-Not you. Ugh.

28:20.615 --> 28:22.283
I want Mulan and Jasmine over there.

28:24.077 --> 28:27.288
Someone's got a thing
for Pan-Asian Disney princesses.

28:27.372 --> 28:31.209
The year I turned 13, my little sister
used to watch that shit on a loop.

28:31.292 --> 28:33.962
Interesting. Answer me this.

28:34.045 --> 28:38.675
Do you go one on each side
or is it more of an alternating suck?

28:38.758 --> 28:41.219
That's my business.
We got a deal or what?

28:42.053 --> 28:45.265
I think I can arrange
your little feast from the East.

28:45.348 --> 28:48.059
But, so you know,
Teng is a competitive swimmer

28:48.143 --> 28:49.477
and Chambal's from northern Maine.

28:49.561 --> 28:53.982
So, you got more of
an Ariel-Elsa situation, if you ask me.

28:54.065 --> 28:57.569
You want your incident report,
go get me my Oriental combo.

28:57.652 --> 29:03.366
Fine, but if I make this happen,
price goes down to two-hundy.

29:04.659 --> 29:08.329
Listen to you,
bargaining like an Arab at a flea market.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.373
Let's see you make it happen.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.834
Then I might be in a better mood
to negotiate.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.262
[Ward] So this is where
you've been all day.

29:24.345 --> 29:26.181
Yeah, doing Fig's job for her.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.684
New company directive.
We turn all our inmate files into scores.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.061
-Sounds about right.
-[chuckles]

29:32.145 --> 29:35.148
Hey, I was wondering if I could get
a personal day tomorrow.

29:35.231 --> 29:36.816
What for? [sighs]

29:37.734 --> 29:38.693
It's personal.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.363
Yeah. You get your shift covered,
the day's all yours.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.157
Good. [sighs] Thanks.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.161
Sure must take a lot out of you,
turning people into numbers.

29:48.244 --> 29:52.957
[grunts] You know,
once you get in the flow,

29:53.041 --> 29:54.918
it's actually kind of relaxing. [chuckles]

29:55.585 --> 29:56.711
[sighs]

29:57.712 --> 29:59.839
[Luschek grunting] Warm-ups.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.012
Hey, you came back.

30:07.472 --> 30:10.517
I can't stay. I need to talk to you
about something important.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.520
Me too.
Is cumbia a type of music or a person?

30:14.103 --> 30:15.313
This is serious.

30:15.396 --> 30:16.898
<i>Hola, amiga.</i>

30:16.981 --> 30:19.442
Thought Badison told you
not to show your face around here.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.444
Hey, shut up.

30:22.278 --> 30:23.655
This class is open to everyone. All right, uh, what's up?

30:26.699 --> 30:27.784
Talk to you later.

30:30.078 --> 30:33.039
Just 'cause you moved blocks
don't mean we forgot you, Mendoza.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.917
Yeah, now we double-hate you, D-Bitch.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.421
Hey! Hey... that was not cool, ladies.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.174
Dance in the back of the class today
and think about your behavior.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.218
[both scoff]

30:45.301 --> 30:47.887
What's the square root of 4,096?

30:47.971 --> 30:49.347
Sixty four.

30:50.098 --> 30:55.603
But thanks to PolyCon GED program,
my options are infinite.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.522
I sure hope I pass.

30:57.605 --> 31:01.150
I don't want normal and easy and simple.

31:01.734 --> 31:03.194
I want...

31:03.987 --> 31:05.321
I want...

31:05.947 --> 31:08.366
I want painful...

31:09.909 --> 31:12.954
difficult... devastating--

31:13.037 --> 31:14.497
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.

31:14.581 --> 31:18.585
[grunts] That is Olivia Pope from <i>Scandal.</i>

31:19.252 --> 31:20.378
I am trying to help here.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.882
Okay, let's just do it again.

31:23.965 --> 31:26.926
I thought being in this video
would be less boring

31:27.010 --> 31:30.388
than sitting in my cell all day, but I can
admit when I'm wrong. Can I leave?

31:30.471 --> 31:34.142
If I have to be here, you have to be here.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.060
Maybe if someone didn't keep fucking up--

31:36.144 --> 31:40.648
No. No, no. Um, I am playing the moment.

31:40.732 --> 31:44.235
Okay, people. Hello. Okay.

31:45.612 --> 31:49.240
You need to stick to the script.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.784
You, lose the sourpuss.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.745
And when you say your line,

31:53.828 --> 31:57.790
I need you to look up to the sky and
put your hands together in prayer. Okay?

31:57.874 --> 31:59.083
[scoffs] Not happening.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.127
You and God have a break-up?

32:01.210 --> 32:02.378
None of your fucking business.

32:02.462 --> 32:03.838
Um...

32:03.922 --> 32:06.925
I'll do it. Or if you want,

32:07.008 --> 32:11.262
I can give it more of a, uh, Jewish vibe.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.015
Or Hindu.

32:15.016 --> 32:19.479
You know, Buddhists just mostly sit,
but I do have a believable satanist.

32:19.562 --> 32:22.231
Why don't you say the lines as written,
okay, Meryl Streep?

32:23.900 --> 32:26.069
Let's get through
this fucking thing already, please.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.446
You always so angry?

32:28.529 --> 32:30.073
Fuck off.

32:30.156 --> 32:31.991
It wasn't an insult.

32:32.075 --> 32:34.160
Rage can be very useful.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.496
You wanna be useful?

32:38.081 --> 32:39.707
What are you talking about?

32:40.708 --> 32:43.336
D-Block's gearing up for battle,
so if you want in...

32:43.419 --> 32:46.297
-[Linda] Why aren't we rolling?
-[woman] I'm changing the battery.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.966
...Daddy says now's your big chance.

32:48.049 --> 32:51.511
-[woman] All set.
-[Linda] Thank you. And action.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.973
What's the square root of 4,096?

32:55.056 --> 32:56.516
-Sixty-four.
-Sixty-four.

32:56.599 --> 32:59.394
Ah, dang it. Sorry. Sorry.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.689
[printer whirring]

33:04.440 --> 33:06.359
Hey, you got my list?

33:06.442 --> 33:08.695
Yep. Hot off the presses.

33:08.778 --> 33:10.613
It was a pain in the ass,
but they're all here,

33:10.697 --> 33:13.449
ranked in order from one to 635.

33:13.533 --> 33:14.367
Excellent.

33:14.450 --> 33:16.035
What's all this for anyhow?

33:16.119 --> 33:18.871
Some new PolyCon directive
that has us replacing

33:18.955 --> 33:21.040
all the short-sentenced,
well-behaved inmates

33:21.124 --> 33:24.002
with more violent long-termers
who'll give us more bang for the buck.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.005
So corporate gets rich and we get stuck
with the worst of the worst, huh?

33:27.088 --> 33:28.256
Basically, yeah.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.925
Oh, and the top 25 on the list
get released on Friday,

33:31.009 --> 33:33.886
so you'd better get going
on that outtake prep.

33:33.970 --> 33:36.264
Dinner's on me if you have to stay late.

33:36.347 --> 33:40.560
See, silver lining.
Just keep it under 12 bucks.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.313
[sighs]

33:46.107 --> 33:48.067
[Red] Fucking Carol.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.738
She has the attention span of a gnat.

33:51.821 --> 33:56.451
Wooing me with her card games
and her deep-conditioning hooch.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.911
-And then one tiny setback...
-[sighs]

33:58.995 --> 34:03.249
That last nose-break fixed my snoring.
Have you noticed?

34:03.332 --> 34:05.084
You should be able to sleep
like a baby now.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.545
How can I sleep
knowing Frieda's in Florida

34:07.628 --> 34:11.424
living the life of Riley
while I'm stuck in this cesspool,

34:11.507 --> 34:14.552
missing all the good years
with my grandchildren?

34:14.635 --> 34:17.096
I find that the trick
is to let go of your anger

34:17.180 --> 34:19.807
-and focus on what you have.
-[scoffs]

34:19.891 --> 34:24.187
I lost my sense of smell,
but I still have my smemories.

34:26.064 --> 34:28.232
Like Pop-Pop's tater tot pie.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.735
Smells are not children.

34:30.818 --> 34:34.614
My sniffer's never coming back.
Your grandkids can still visit.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.325
I've been begging my son for months.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.875
Those babies were my one chance
to get it right.

34:47.168 --> 34:50.004
They only love you
when they're little, you know.

34:50.880 --> 34:54.592
And Frieda,
she's taken all that away from me.

34:55.802 --> 34:58.763
Ten more years. [sniffles]

34:58.846 --> 35:00.640
And she got Carol 30.

35:00.723 --> 35:02.934
Yeah, which is three times worse.

35:03.017 --> 35:04.977
And look how well
Carol managed to let it go.

35:05.061 --> 35:09.107
I should have known someone so petty
couldn't be trusted.

35:11.567 --> 35:15.238
No, if I want Frieda dead...

35:16.989 --> 35:18.866
I'll have to do it myself.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.078
Or you could choose to be happy.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.498
Isn't it impossible
to get into Florida anyway?

35:25.581 --> 35:29.794
Bin Laden was squirreled away
in a Pakistani compound for ten years,

35:29.877 --> 35:32.547
but they eventually got to him,
didn't they?

35:33.548 --> 35:35.675
Good on Obama for that one.

35:36.676 --> 35:40.596
The key is to stay vigilant
and keep focused.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.557
Something Carol knows nothing about.

35:42.640 --> 35:47.395
One minute she's with me, and the next
she's only into her stupid gang war.

35:47.478 --> 35:50.314
I really hope I'm out of here
before that starts.

35:51.899 --> 35:53.359
Oh, my poor girl.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.571
You don't know, do you?

35:57.697 --> 35:58.614
Know what?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.575
You're not getting out early.

36:01.826 --> 36:05.246
That was Carol having her fun with you.

36:07.206 --> 36:11.419
That fucking bitch.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.674
Not so easy to let it go, is it?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.470
[indistinct chatter]

36:22.805 --> 36:28.769
Hey, there's the famous radio DJ.
How you doing, FYI Flava Flav?

36:28.853 --> 36:32.690
It's actually DIY Fly Flaca,
but pretty good, I guess.

36:32.773 --> 36:36.944
You know, I'm a big fan of the show.
I never miss it.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.238
-[Flaca] Mmm.
-Um...

36:40.448 --> 36:43.534
Does Luschek still, uh,
oversee that for you?

36:44.619 --> 36:49.081
If by "oversee," you mean
sleeps in a chair nearby, then yeah.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.628
You ever think about having guests
on your show to mix things up a bit?

36:53.711 --> 36:56.464
[sighs] Right now,
I don't even have a cohost.

36:56.547 --> 36:58.716
They're keeping Cindy overnight
for Taystee's trial.

36:58.799 --> 37:02.720
But even when she is here, she's all,
"Wah, my guilt this, ow, my back that."

37:02.803 --> 37:05.264
[scoffs] Must be a Jewish thing.

37:07.266 --> 37:08.601
You know what?

37:08.684 --> 37:12.521
If you want, I could cohost with you
until she gets back.

37:12.605 --> 37:13.940
I'm very entertaining.

37:14.857 --> 37:15.858
You are?

37:15.942 --> 37:18.861
Yeah, okay. Check this out.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.866
What did the snail say
on the back of the turtle?

37:26.077 --> 37:27.578
Whee!

37:28.412 --> 37:29.956
[chuckles]

37:31.832 --> 37:34.460
Oh, you get it? 'Cause...

37:34.543 --> 37:39.257
We do more of a casual banter thing.
You think you could do that?

37:39.840 --> 37:43.803
You kidding me?
I could banter like I invented it.

37:49.934 --> 37:52.353
Sorry, I've got the girls double-booked.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.440
That's okay. [sighs]
'80s bangs aren't really my thing.

38:01.779 --> 38:04.240
Bonnie, Gail, give us a few minutes.

38:11.664 --> 38:12.790
[Alex clears throat]

38:14.000 --> 38:17.086
You got a lot of nerve,
interrupting my beauty hour.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.006
You need to get Badison under control.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.968
Since when did you start telling me
what to do?

38:24.051 --> 38:27.138
Since your minion became hell-bent
on stealing Piper's date.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.682
[scoffs] So Badison's a shit-stirrer.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.602
She's like the fucking handheld blender
of shit-stirring.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.563
Girl goes rogue every now and again,

38:35.646 --> 38:37.815
but at the end of the day,
she does what I need her to.

38:37.898 --> 38:41.360
Like bringing in those phones?
Because that was actually my idea.

38:42.194 --> 38:45.114
The connection to Luschek? Mine.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.407
She never mentioned it.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.616
Of course she didn't.

38:48.451 --> 38:53.289
Badison's so desperate to be your top dog,
she'll never give someone else credit.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.292
You're a very smart woman, Carol.

38:56.375 --> 38:58.753
I honestly don't know
why you keep her around.

38:58.836 --> 39:02.882
Maybe because she's so desperate
to stay my top dog.

39:02.965 --> 39:04.300
And she's got her moves.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.011
Please! I had better moves
in the eighth grade.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.055
By the time I was 21,

39:09.138 --> 39:12.433
I was moving 50 kilos of black tar
through three continents.

39:13.642 --> 39:14.810
You still got connections?

39:15.686 --> 39:16.937
That depends.

39:18.022 --> 39:20.941
You gonna keep Badison
from giving Piper more time?

39:21.025 --> 39:23.903
[chuckles] You must really love this girl.

39:26.864 --> 39:28.449
Yeah, I do. [chuckles softly]

39:29.784 --> 39:34.622
I do this for you...
it means you're working for me now.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.125
Then I guess we have a deal.

39:57.728 --> 39:59.146
[indistinct chatter]

40:05.945 --> 40:07.488
Hey, excuse me.

40:08.697 --> 40:09.990
You're head of the guards, right?

40:10.866 --> 40:11.867
That's me.

40:12.868 --> 40:16.122
So if drugs are coming into the prison,
you're responsible?

40:20.459 --> 40:21.293
What do you mean?

40:22.461 --> 40:26.048
I mean that
drugs are coming into the prison,

40:26.132 --> 40:30.052
and I'm here, as a good citizen...

40:31.262 --> 40:32.221
to turn them in.

40:33.681 --> 40:36.559
Normally, I have no interest
in any of this,

40:36.642 --> 40:41.063
but these drugs are being planted on me
by my sociopathic cellmate,

40:41.147 --> 40:43.983
who is determined
to see me in here till eternity.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.610
Any idea where she got them?

40:46.694 --> 40:50.156
No... but girls talk.

40:51.198 --> 40:53.367
Especially to me. They just open up.

40:53.451 --> 40:59.039
So, if you agree to protect me,
I'd be more than happy to sniff around,

40:59.123 --> 41:00.666
find out exactly who's bringing in what.

41:03.294 --> 41:04.170
Appreciate the help.

41:05.963 --> 41:06.964
Likewise.

41:15.055 --> 41:18.642
Ms. Jefferson, you were sentenced
to Litchfield camp

41:18.726 --> 41:21.729
on a low-level, non-violent drug offense.
Is that correct?

41:21.812 --> 41:22.897
-Yes, ma'am.
-[mic feedback]

41:22.980 --> 41:24.773
-[jurors exclaim]
-[Taystee clears throat]

41:24.857 --> 41:28.402
Sorry. Uh, yes, I was.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.488
And were you guilty of that crime?

41:31.489 --> 41:35.618
Yes. That is why I pled guilty
instead of going to trial.

41:35.701 --> 41:36.660
[door opens]

41:38.329 --> 41:43.417
Could you tell the members of the jury
how that drug charge came about?

41:44.752 --> 41:46.629
[Taystee] Well... [sighs]

41:46.712 --> 41:52.968
Um, when I aged out of group home,
I didn't have nowhere else...

41:55.095 --> 41:58.474
Excuse me... anywhere else to live.

41:59.308 --> 42:02.353
So, I stayed with a lady dealer,
who gave me a bed

42:02.436 --> 42:05.189
in exchange
for me handling her account books.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.317
Um, that's because I'm good at math.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.529
How many years
did you live in a group home?

42:12.571 --> 42:17.326
Pretty much my entire life.
Or at least for as long as I can remember.

42:17.409 --> 42:18.994
[lawyer] And what was that like for you?

42:19.078 --> 42:22.331
Objection. I don't see
how Ms. Jefferson's childhood is relevant.

42:22.414 --> 42:23.541
I'm getting there.

42:23.624 --> 42:24.875
I'll allow it.

42:26.710 --> 42:30.256
I was asking, what was
the group home environment like for you?

42:30.839 --> 42:32.216
Loud.

42:32.299 --> 42:36.387
I mean, when you get
eight or nine kids in a house,

42:36.470 --> 42:41.350
it's a lot of fighting.
So, I was usually the one breaking it up.

42:41.433 --> 42:45.354
You know, the peacemaker.
Or the referee.

42:45.437 --> 42:48.732
So your role
as lead negotiator in the riot,

42:48.816 --> 42:50.734
that was a familiar one for you?

42:50.818 --> 42:52.194
Yes. Yes, it was.

42:52.278 --> 42:55.739
Ms. Jefferson, why would you take on
this leadership role in the riot

42:55.823 --> 42:59.285
when you could have
very easily chosen not to participate?

43:01.495 --> 43:04.290
[sighs] Well, I had a best friend once.

43:05.583 --> 43:12.214
And the entire time I knew her,
she never let me down.

43:13.007 --> 43:16.677
Uh, and then she was killed by a guard,

43:17.678 --> 43:19.430
uh, when she didn't even do nothing.

43:21.223 --> 43:22.808
[sighs] Anything.

43:23.934 --> 43:28.397
Uh, and even then, I never lost hope

43:28.480 --> 43:33.485
because when she was alive,
my friend, Poussey,

43:33.569 --> 43:37.489
[chuckles] she never did,
even when life was rough.

43:37.573 --> 43:41.910
So I chose to participate in the riot

43:41.994 --> 43:46.123
because I wanted justice for her death.

43:48.626 --> 43:53.339
So your best friend
was killed by a guard...

43:54.048 --> 43:56.634
and yet you weren't seeking revenge?

43:56.717 --> 43:57.718
No.

43:58.802 --> 44:01.013
I never wanted anybody else to die.

44:02.014 --> 44:07.394
All I wanted was
for the person who killed my friend

44:07.478 --> 44:09.980
to be up here where I am now,

44:10.064 --> 44:12.316
telling you why he murdered...

44:14.360 --> 44:16.570
Why he murdered an innocent person,

44:18.238 --> 44:22.034
instead of me,
explaining why I didn't kill a guilty one.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.594
Scram, losers.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.187
Hey, Carol.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.732
Sure you want to frizz up your new 'do
with all this humidity?

44:53.816 --> 44:55.567
What the fuck is wrong with you?

44:55.651 --> 44:58.570
Chasing after Chapman on the playground
when we're gearing up for war?

44:59.279 --> 45:00.697
Ever heard of multitasking?

45:00.781 --> 45:03.951
Seems to me you can't even do
the one fucking job I gave you.

45:04.034 --> 45:08.288
Vause told me the phones were her idea
and using Luschek as our pipeline.

45:08.372 --> 45:11.667
[chuckles] Ideas are like assholes.

45:11.750 --> 45:14.128
We all got 'em and most of 'em stink.

45:14.211 --> 45:16.088
Doesn't matter who thought of what.

45:16.171 --> 45:18.424
I'm the one on the ground
running this thing.

45:18.507 --> 45:19.967
Not anymore, you're not.

45:20.968 --> 45:24.888
You're cutting me loose?
In the middle of a freakin' war?

45:24.972 --> 45:28.517
No. It's never a good idea
to change horses midstream.

45:29.101 --> 45:33.647
That's why I'm pairing you up with Vause.
Double the flavor, double the fun.

45:33.730 --> 45:35.065
[chuckles]

45:35.149 --> 45:37.609
No, forget it. I ain't working with her.

45:38.193 --> 45:41.196
Keep mouthing off
and you'll be working for her.

45:43.073 --> 45:45.868
And if I catch you
trying to steal Chapman's date,

45:45.951 --> 45:47.953
or messing with her in any way...

45:49.663 --> 45:53.083
you can bet your pasty white ass
there'll be consequences.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.673
[Linda] Hurry,
we have two more scenes to go.

46:04.386 --> 46:05.721
[Flaca] Um...

46:05.804 --> 46:07.764
-Hey, Luschek.
-[Luschek] Hey.

46:07.848 --> 46:09.516
-[Gloria] Where you going?
-Um--

46:09.600 --> 46:11.018
Are you wearing mascara?

46:11.602 --> 46:13.479
It's manscara.

46:13.562 --> 46:16.106
It turns out
I'm the, uh, diversity hire for the video.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.983
Don't worry,
Alvarez'll take good care of you.

46:18.066 --> 46:19.568
Hello, let's keep it moving.

46:19.651 --> 46:21.945
We're already way behind schedule.
Come on.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.614
Listen, I got to talk to you.

46:24.281 --> 46:25.741
Just write me a note.

46:27.409 --> 46:32.247
Stupid video. [scoffs] Can you believe
they didn't ask me to be in it?

46:32.331 --> 46:34.541
Maybe they thought I'd be too distracting.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.586
Yeah, like, "Who's that hot girl
in that lame video?"

46:38.504 --> 46:41.131
[sighs] I could use some help over here.

46:41.215 --> 46:42.508
[Flaca] I'll do it.

46:42.591 --> 46:45.052
[Gloria] Um, you want to help us?
Get us some water.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.721
[chuckles] I can't leave you unsupervised.

46:47.804 --> 46:51.975
How are we supposed to talk for
two straight hours if our throats get dry?

46:52.059 --> 46:54.186
Fine. I'll be back in a second.

46:54.269 --> 46:56.939
But technically,
it's a minute-four, round trip,

46:57.022 --> 46:58.815
plus the time it takes to fill the water.

46:59.816 --> 47:00.817
Um... excuse me.

47:07.241 --> 47:09.952
-Where are you going?
-Yeah, I'll be right there.

47:11.328 --> 47:12.329
[vocalizing]

47:18.418 --> 47:20.671
[sputtering]

47:22.297 --> 47:23.840
[continues vocalizing]

47:36.436 --> 47:39.273
Let's go, Reznikov.
You're late for visitation.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.233
I'm not expecting anyone. There's a couple
of screaming babies in there

47:43.277 --> 47:45.696
and their parents just gave me your name.

47:47.656 --> 47:48.824
I can't believe it.

47:51.451 --> 47:52.911
He brought my grandchildren.

47:52.995 --> 47:55.080
See, what'd I tell you?

47:55.163 --> 47:58.125
The universe delivers a bounty
as soon as you let things go.

47:58.208 --> 48:00.961
The universe doesn't give a fuck
about any of you. Look where you live. Even you can't ruin this for me.

48:05.048 --> 48:06.842
-The day is still young.
-Eh.

48:12.639 --> 48:16.101
Hey, guys,
I'm calling off the whole Hellman thing.

48:16.184 --> 48:18.604
That's an ixnay on the BJ. Got it?

48:18.687 --> 48:20.731
Tell that to my dick breath.

48:20.814 --> 48:22.441
Aftertaste's even worse.

48:22.524 --> 48:25.068
How did you blow him already?
It's not even noon.

48:25.152 --> 48:29.615
Oh. I used to be a big procrastinator.
Then I read this book, <i>Eat the Frog.</i>

48:29.698 --> 48:31.366
You read a book about sucking dick?

48:31.450 --> 48:33.285
It's about procrastination.

48:33.368 --> 48:37.414
Says if you do your worst task first,
rest of the day's easy in comparison.

48:37.497 --> 48:40.584
Shit. You didn't see
where Hellman went, did you?

48:40.667 --> 48:43.045
Nope, but I saw where he came.

48:43.128 --> 48:46.506
-[Badison sighs]
-Yeah, you owe me some mouthwash, bitch.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.846
[Hellman]
Hey, boss, got a new incident report, but all the file boxes are messed up.
What should I do with it?

48:55.766 --> 48:57.434
Just give it to me.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.542
[baby crying]

49:27.506 --> 49:30.175
<i>Baba</i> is coming. You wanna talk to her?
Wanna talk to <i>Baba?</i>

49:30.258 --> 49:31.885
You never met your grandkids before?

49:31.968 --> 49:34.680
The baby is still little
and Kolya's only three.

49:34.763 --> 49:37.265
Or is it four? I've lost track.

49:37.349 --> 49:39.518
My God, I don't even know what he likes.

49:39.601 --> 49:42.562
Probably trucks and trains,
if he's anything like his father.

49:42.646 --> 49:44.648
I wonder if he even speaks Russian.

49:45.732 --> 49:48.151
Will he know to call me <i>"Baba"?</i>

49:48.235 --> 49:50.612
Oh, who cares. Let him call me "Grandma"
if he wants.

49:50.696 --> 49:53.323
All right, inmates, you're up.

50:03.709 --> 50:04.668
What the hell, lady?

50:05.711 --> 50:08.630
-Look me in the eye, coward.
-[gasping]

50:08.714 --> 50:11.925
Back off. Out of the way. Out of the way!

50:12.008 --> 50:15.887
-You were my friend. How could you?
-[grunts]

50:15.971 --> 50:17.347
[Danilo] Reznikov!

50:17.431 --> 50:20.142
You're off to the SHU.
You ruined things all on your own.

50:20.225 --> 50:21.518
I trusted you, Frieda!

50:21.601 --> 50:25.105
And you threw me to the wolves
like a bag of old meat.

50:25.188 --> 50:29.484
And for what?
Better TV and some extra pudding cups?

50:36.491 --> 50:39.244
-[baby continues crying]
-Any minute. She's coming.

50:40.662 --> 50:41.997
[boy whining]

50:57.721 --> 50:58.680
[clears throat]

50:59.514 --> 51:04.186
I came here today because, um,
I thought that I could trust a guard.

51:05.061 --> 51:10.442
But these COs, they don't give a shit
about protecting any of us.

51:10.525 --> 51:13.904
The truth is that they want us to fight

51:13.987 --> 51:16.823
because they're playing
some sick game with us

51:16.907 --> 51:20.327
where they score points
for everything that we do.

51:20.410 --> 51:22.829
Like the time that you had a fight
with your bunkie,

51:22.913 --> 51:26.750
or the one time, right,
that you may have puked in the sink.

51:26.833 --> 51:31.046
These fuckers...
These fuckers score points from that.

51:31.129 --> 51:34.341
And we're too busy
trying to kill each other to even notice.

51:34.424 --> 51:38.261
I mean, fuck, <i>mamas,</i>
what are we doing to ourselves?

51:38.345 --> 51:40.847
-[pounding on door]
-No, wait.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.099
[Alvarez] Goddamn,
open this door right now.

51:43.183 --> 51:47.938
No. We're destroying ourselves
while they cheer us on from the sidelines.

51:48.021 --> 51:52.025
Listen, I'm not saying that we gotta be
best friends or nothing like that,

51:52.108 --> 51:55.153
but, you know, for once,
can't we just stop this shit

51:55.237 --> 51:58.907
with the blue versus khaki, and just...

51:58.990 --> 52:03.495
I don't know, man, be...
be on the same side for once?

52:04.371 --> 52:06.540
That was dope. Seriously.

52:07.916 --> 52:10.919
I'm gonna let him in and then you gotta
say all that shit on the air.

52:11.002 --> 52:12.003
Wait. What do you mean?

52:12.087 --> 52:15.423
Well, the guard has to come in
and use their key to turn that switch.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.259
But that was a great warm-up.

52:21.972 --> 52:24.474
[exhales] What's going on in here? Honestly, uh, I have no idea.

52:27.143 --> 52:28.144
She's telling the truth.

52:28.228 --> 52:30.939
She don't know nothing.
I was the one that closed the door.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.275
Go back to your cell, inmate.

52:36.278 --> 52:40.156
Look. Look what I found.
Your scoresheets.

52:40.740 --> 52:43.451
You sick fuck. You know what?

52:43.535 --> 52:46.454
Everyone is gonna find out
what you're doing.

52:46.538 --> 52:52.502
Well, they won't be hearing it from you
because you are going to the SHU.

52:57.632 --> 52:59.384
[indistinct chatter]

53:18.236 --> 53:19.529
I fixed it.

53:20.530 --> 53:21.364
What do you mean?

53:21.448 --> 53:23.825
You know how you said
going to a CO wouldn't work?

53:24.492 --> 53:29.289
Well, the trick was going
above their heads

53:29.372 --> 53:31.541
to the big boss, Hopper.

53:31.625 --> 53:33.960
I explained the situation to him
and I promised him

53:34.044 --> 53:38.798
that I would give him intel
on inter-prison goings-on,

53:38.882 --> 53:41.301
and it worked.

53:41.384 --> 53:43.595
I just walked through the common area

53:43.678 --> 53:48.516
and Badison walked around me. [chuckles]

53:48.600 --> 53:51.144
-I think she even kind of smiled.
-Mmm.

53:51.227 --> 53:54.481
That's creepy. It's good, but it's creepy.

53:54.564 --> 53:58.485
Now we can spend the rest of our time
in here without living in fear.

53:59.903 --> 54:01.863
Nice job. I'm glad it all worked out.

54:01.947 --> 54:05.408
I love you so much.

54:06.993 --> 54:08.411
I love you too, Pipes.

54:08.495 --> 54:09.955
Now what about that grad school app?

54:10.038 --> 54:14.125
Because I was thinking,
the trick is to put the right spin on it.

54:14.209 --> 54:17.921
Like, instead of saying
"former drug dealer,"

54:18.004 --> 54:23.927
we could say that you were
VP of sales and distribution

54:24.010 --> 54:27.347
for Kubra Industries Worldwide.

54:28.348 --> 54:31.393
Very doublespeak creative. I like it.

54:31.476 --> 54:34.938
But, alas, you are too late.
I already sent it in.

54:35.522 --> 54:37.732
You ate the frog.
Didn't I tell you that was a good book?

54:37.816 --> 54:40.902
Oh, you ate the application frog!

54:41.611 --> 54:43.738
You better be careful
or we'll get shots again.

54:54.749 --> 54:56.042
You like it?

54:57.293 --> 54:58.461
Oh, yeah.

55:00.338 --> 55:01.756
She's-- She's a beauty.

55:03.049 --> 55:04.050
Good.
