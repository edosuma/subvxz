number 14, Stanley Boyer</i>

00:47.946 --> 00:48.935
Come on!

00:54.185 --> 00:55.813
We missed four innings

00:56.588 --> 00:59.318
Well, like I said, I had
to stop and do some business

00:59.391 --> 01:01.018
Here, sit down

01:02.394 --> 01:04.658
Hey, you, usher, come here
Can I talk to you a second?

01:04.730 --> 01:05.719
Yes, sir

01:05.796 --> 01:08.162
Can you watch him?
Sure, no problem

01:08.233 --> 01:09.325
I'll be back

01:10.769 --> 01:13.329
Gil, this is Stan He's
gonna watch you for a while

01:13.405 --> 01:14.963
I have some friends
I'm meeting

01:15.040 --> 01:18.134
I'll meet you right here, huh?
For the ninth inning Have fun, kid

01:18.210 --> 01:21.406

01:22.381 --> 01:26.249
Programs here!
Get your programs! Programs!

01:27.019 --> 01:29.283
So, Gilly,
big baseball fan?

01:29.588 --> 01:32.751
Kind of Yeah? Dad bring you here a lot?

01:33.625 --> 01:37.025
Once a year on my birthday Then
he pays an usher to watch me

01:38.897 --> 01:40.454
Oh, I see

01:42.266 --> 01:44.599
Look, you have
to understand

01:44.670 --> 01:48.037
My father,
in his own childhood,

01:48.106 --> 01:50.597
was without
a positive male influence

01:51.209 --> 01:52.471
Huh?

01:52.543 --> 01:55.240
His own father kicked
him out when he was 15,

01:55.847 --> 01:59.749
so my Dad was taught to see
child-raising as a job, a burden,

02:00.918 --> 02:03.888
a prison,
rather than a playground

02:05.823 --> 02:07.621
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

02:08.192 --> 02:09.454
You don't talk like a kid

02:09.526 --> 02:12.052
Yeah, well, I'm not really
a kid You're not a duck

02:12.129 --> 02:14.495
This is a memory
of when I was a kid

02:14.566 --> 02:17.932
I'm 35 now
I have kids of my own

02:19.270 --> 02:21.500
You don't really
even exist

02:22.173 --> 02:25.199
You're an amalgam
A what?

02:26.077 --> 02:30.447
A combination of several ushers
my dad left me with over the years

02:31.382 --> 02:35.149
I've combined them into one memory Why?

02:35.419 --> 02:38.286
This was a great symbolic
moment of my life,

02:38.356 --> 02:40.290
my father dumping me
with you

02:40.558 --> 02:43.789
It's why I swore things would
be different with my kids

02:44.628 --> 02:45.754
That's my dream

02:46.131 --> 02:48.496
Strong, happy,
confident kids

02:49.734 --> 02:53.329
That's great That's great You
know, you got a lovely family,

02:53.405 --> 02:55.804
and I'm a goddamn amalgam

02:56.741 --> 02:57.833
Gil?

03:00.378 --> 03:02.938
Who's that?
That's my wife

03:04.149 --> 03:05.308
Nice

03:05.917 --> 03:07.008
Gil

03:07.852 --> 03:10.787
Yeah?
The game's over, honey

03:12.089 --> 03:15.423

just standing there?

07:28.779 --> 07:30.906
Oh, sweetie! I'm waiting
for her head to spin around

07:30.981 --> 07:33.176
You'll be all right
You'll be okay

07:52.437 --> 07:54.267
Oh, can you
come with me

07:54.338 --> 07:55.930

on Monday morning?

07:56.540 --> 08:00.567
Oh, boy I love it when you talk
to me about school and meetings

08:01.245 --> 08:02.543
Now talk to me
about shopping

08:02.613 --> 08:03.911
No, I know I know
Go on, go on

08:03.981 --> 08:07.473
I'm sorry I just remembered now
I've been meaning to ask you, okay?

08:07.551 --> 08:10.611
Fine I'll be there
Okay

08:16.026 --> 08:17.391
What's the matter?

08:17.896 --> 08:20.762
Nothing I was a little
tense before but now

08:20.831 --> 08:24.267
No, no I mean with Kevin Why are
we going to see his principal?

08:24.334 --> 08:27.735
Oh, because his teacher said
he's been making that face again

08:29.074 --> 08:30.665
What? This?

08:31.075 --> 08:32.941
Yes The tense face

08:34.179 --> 08:36.647
He makes that same face
at Little League

08:37.381 --> 08:38.905
You know what
his teacher asked me?

08:39.683 --> 08:40.673
What?

08:41.152 --> 08:44.144
If we'd ever taken him
for a psychiatric evaluation

08:46.224 --> 08:47.282
What?

08:47.625 --> 08:49.149
She was just asking

08:51.062 --> 08:52.552
Why, because
he makes a face?

08:53.031 --> 08:54.464
Has she ever
looked in the mirror?

08:55.133 --> 08:59.331
You know, the face,
the crying, the nervousness

08:59.403 --> 09:00.666
They mentioned
the crying?

09:00.739 --> 09:05.403
Yeah You know, he doesn't
really finish his work

09:09.314 --> 09:13.375
Hey, we'll talk to them on Monday
Don't worry, I'm sure it'll be fine

09:15.120 --> 09:16.280
Come here

09:20.325 --> 09:21.552
Where was I?

09:22.826 --> 09:23.850

Yeah, yeah
I was there already?

09:25.697 --> 09:26.686
Mmm-hmm

09:33.738 --> 09:35.899
You know,
that really pisses me off

09:36.574 --> 09:39.270
Kid's a little different, a little
special, needs a little more attention,

09:39.344 --> 09:41.938
teacher's gonna put a
label on him "Problem kid"

09:42.013 --> 09:43.378
When we go see
Kevin's principal,

09:43.448 --> 09:44.938
let's find out who his
teacher is gonna be next year

09:45.016 --> 09:47.450
and make sure it's not
one of these hysterics!

09:47.519 --> 09:52.182
You're right, Gil You know, Kevin's
great He can't be that much of a problem

09:52.924 --> 09:56.291
Right Now, if it was
my sister's kid

09:56.694 --> 09:58.286

I don't know why,
but the place is a mess

11:19.076 --> 11:20.066
Could you just
give me a hand?

11:20.144 --> 11:21.235
Yeah, okay,
in just a few minutes

11:21.312 --> 11:23.576
Are you all right? I thought
I heard you moaning last night

11:23.648 --> 11:25.479
Well, I kind of had a
little bit of a stomachache,

11:25.550 --> 11:27.347
but it's fine now
It's gone

11:27.418 --> 11:29.648
You hate me?
What?

11:29.721 --> 11:33.418
You know, for making you study so
much and giving up all your dates

11:33.658 --> 11:35.182
No, you were right

11:35.460 --> 11:38.725
Honey, I'm telling you, those
SAT scores are your ticket

11:39.197 --> 11:41.495
And, sweetie, you know,
once you get to school,

11:41.566 --> 11:45.593
you're gonna meet a lot of guys that
you like just as well as that Tod

11:46.137 --> 11:48.901
Why do you always say "that
Tod"? It just sounds so

11:48.973 --> 11:52.500
You're right I'm sorry It's
been pleasant for a moment

11:53.544 --> 11:57.002
Okay, I guess I'm just gonna give
everybody spaghetti and salad,

11:57.081 --> 12:00.346
and I better cook a steak for
my dad See you later, honey

12:04.522 --> 12:06.046
Are you okay?

12:08.092 --> 12:10.652
Man, your mother can talk!

12:12.629 --> 12:15.622
Gosh, she hates my ass

12:15.833 --> 12:17.266
And it's such
a cute ass

12:19.336 --> 12:21.771
Last night, she heard the
moaning She thought it was me

12:21.839 --> 12:22.828
Yeah?
Mmm-hmm

12:23.074 --> 12:25.872
So you're gonna have to try
and control yourself, Tod

12:27.578 --> 12:30.342
With you? It's impossible

12:39.791 --> 12:41.224
Wait
What?

12:41.292 --> 12:43.817
I brought something
Ooh! Good

12:51.336 --> 12:53.167
We can record our love

12:53.838 --> 12:56.432
Susan Hi, Sis, it's Helen

12:56.507 --> 12:59.840
Yeah, did I loan you my big
platter? Oh, great, great

12:59.911 --> 13:01.242
Yeah, I thought so Would
you bring it over tonight?

13:01.312 --> 13:03.143
I just need it to serve

13:03.381 --> 13:07.249
Oh, listen,
Julie got 1,291 on her SATs

13:08.987 --> 13:12.616
I know I know I feel so
proud of her It's great

13:12.690 --> 13:14.089
Yeah How's Patty?

13:14.658 --> 13:16.354
We're a little disappointed
with the effort

13:16.427 --> 13:19.294
she's been giving lately
towards her work

13:19.764 --> 13:22.631
Math, French,
everything's gone down

13:23.901 --> 13:28.167
Nathan's talking to her right now
He's trying to figure out what's wrong

13:29.073 --> 13:31.166
Look, Patty,
all I'm saying is,

13:31.342 --> 13:34.743
if you wanna have just an
ordinary academic career

13:34.812 --> 13:38.543
and attend an ordinary university,
that's your prerogative,

13:38.616 --> 13:42.074
but I must tell you I think
you're selling yourself way short

13:42.552 --> 13:44.110
How's it going?

13:44.689 --> 13:48.557
I don't know Sometimes I feel as
though we want it more than she does

13:50.328 --> 13:52.158
Patty, you know
we love you

13:52.830 --> 13:56.823
Could you just give your father that
little extra effort he's looking for?

13:59.771 --> 14:01.033
Okay, Mama

14:03.807 --> 14:05.206
That's all I ask

14:07.311 --> 14:08.744
Come on, Kevin

14:10.081 --> 14:13.414
I want that, Kevin I want that! No

14:13.551 --> 14:15.348

Was it yours or Helen or
Susan's wedding I got drunk at?

14:31.302 --> 14:33.896
It was all three, Dad
Congratulations

14:34.405 --> 14:36.930
Well, which one did I
punch the bandleader?

14:37.742 --> 14:40.040
That was mine
We have photos

14:40.378 --> 14:42.846
I'm having them blown up
for the commitment hearings

14:44.182 --> 14:47.879
You think he's funny, huh? When
he was a kid, he wasn't this funny

14:47.951 --> 14:52.821
Stayed in his room all day Boy, you
were a moody little son of a bitch

14:54.158 --> 14:56.023
Gee, I wonder why?

14:57.728 --> 14:59.923
Do you remember that little
guy who wouldn't leave my side?

14:59.997 --> 15:01.021
I know

15:01.099 --> 15:05.263
Well, now, you know, if I take a step
towards him, he just takes a step away

15:06.637 --> 15:08.571
I don't know what's
happening to him, you know

15:08.639 --> 15:10.163
He's just so unhappy

15:10.241 --> 15:13.642
and he won't talk to me, and
I don't know how to help him

15:14.545 --> 15:17.070
Did you ever consider
having Ed talk to him?

15:17.215 --> 15:19.206
Are you kidding?

15:19.283 --> 15:21.911
He won't even acknowledge
he's got these kids,

15:22.019 --> 15:25.785
now that he's got his new wife
and his new kids!

15:27.125 --> 15:29.593
He won't even fix
my kids' teeth anymore

15:29.660 --> 15:31.651
He says it makes him
uncomfortable

15:31.729 --> 15:32.821
Please

15:32.897 --> 15:35.627
Yeah, I wish he'd drop
his drill down his pants

15:36.801 --> 15:38.427
Are you seeing anybody?

15:39.971 --> 15:42.496
Well, Garry's biology teacher
asked me out

15:43.141 --> 15:45.575
Biology? That's promising

15:46.444 --> 15:49.311
No, no, no, no He's not
the type I usually go for

15:52.216 --> 15:55.811
<i>"The Penal Colony
by Franz Kafka"</i>

15:56.586 --> 15:58.578
Hey, Nathan,
Patty a doctor yet?

15:59.557 --> 16:00.854
Mock if you will

16:01.526 --> 16:02.550
All right

16:02.627 --> 16:05.994
Our children are more capable of retaining
and absorbing information than we are,

16:06.063 --> 16:09.521
and yet we insist on treating
them like adorable little morons

16:12.235 --> 16:15.467
What are you saying, Patty
can learn things I can't learn?

16:18.242 --> 16:24.044
Patty, which one of these
is the square root of 8,649?

16:30.454 --> 16:32.012
Ninety-three

16:41.666 --> 16:44.600
They're like sponges, Gil,
just waiting to absorb

16:45.369 --> 16:46.563
I want this

16:46.938 --> 16:47.927
You see?

16:49.273 --> 16:54.142
Take my advice Forget about Kevin and
Taylor It's too late Work on Justin

16:54.645 --> 16:58.809
Actually, Justin is quite bright In
his preschool class, he was the only

17:02.787 --> 17:05.255
Slow down, Justin
I'll get you some dip

17:09.359 --> 17:13.296
Oh, you remember that guy you went
out with in college? Jeffrey Sanders?

17:13.631 --> 17:16.191
You know, you always chased me out
of the room whenever he came over

17:16.267 --> 17:18.394
Oh, yeah
I saw him today

17:18.469 --> 17:20.096
God, what a loser, huh?

17:20.371 --> 17:22.134
In a Rolls

17:22.205 --> 17:23.934
I meant me

17:24.741 --> 17:26.266
What is that?

17:26.911 --> 17:29.573
Oh, Nathan and Patty and I
are power-eating

17:29.646 --> 17:31.740
We bring our own
food everywhere

17:31.982 --> 17:34.611
He turned me onto it,
and I never felt better

17:35.318 --> 17:36.411
Where do you
get that stuff?

17:36.487 --> 17:39.547
This is it Everybody in the living
room This is the big surprise

17:39.624 --> 17:40.750
Okay, Frank

17:42.093 --> 17:45.551
Oh, Larry My baby

17:46.396 --> 17:48.297
You look great
Dad!

17:48.365 --> 17:49.890
How are you, son?

17:49.967 --> 17:52.401
Oh, boy
Great to see you!

17:52.470 --> 17:54.961
Shit
Well put

17:55.273 --> 17:57.764
Who's that? Wait a second,
I've got something for you

17:57.842 --> 18:00.173
That's my kid brother
Larry Your uncle

18:00.278 --> 18:02.246
Don't give him
any money

18:02.313 --> 18:03.439
I won't

18:03.514 --> 18:06.813
Just a little something for
being the best dad in the world

18:08.219 --> 18:11.746
I found it a couple of months
ago It's for your collection

18:11.822 --> 18:12.981
A toy car!

18:13.057 --> 18:16.254
Oh, this is great
A Stutz!

18:16.994 --> 18:20.122
Yeah, you got it Spend
it on the people you love,

18:20.631 --> 18:21.859
right?

18:23.734 --> 18:27.067
Is this Grandma?
Yeah, she's still alive

18:33.644 --> 18:35.544
Jesus, Grandma,
you got short

18:36.113 --> 18:37.603
I'm shrinking

18:38.249 --> 18:39.546
Bummer

18:40.951 --> 18:42.076
Gilbo

18:43.754 --> 18:45.016
Larry

18:46.557 --> 18:49.526
How long has it been?
Three years? About that

18:49.660 --> 18:51.684
You stopped
wearing your turban

18:52.529 --> 18:53.622
Yeah

18:54.932 --> 18:59.664
My God, Susan, you look great
If you weren't my sister

19:01.872 --> 19:05.672
Helen, I know
it's been hard

19:06.777 --> 19:07.937
Dad?

19:12.316 --> 19:14.978
You were supposed to wait
outside so I could introduce you

19:18.689 --> 19:23.490
Well, why don't you
do it now, Larry?

19:29.500 --> 19:30.524
Everybody,

19:32.135 --> 19:34.331
this is my son Cool

19:37.975 --> 19:40.409
Did he say, "Cool"?
Cool

19:40.978 --> 19:43.572
Your son?
It's a long story

19:45.583 --> 19:48.313
Let's eat
Yeah, well, good idea

19:48.719 --> 19:50.380
Keep Patty
away from my brother

19:50.453 --> 19:52.944
He'll suck the intelligence
right out of her

19:55.359 --> 19:59.818
Cool is adorable Adorable Why didn't
you ever write us you had a son?

20:00.096 --> 20:02.930
I didn't know myself
until a couple of months ago

20:03.834 --> 20:08.702
You see, a few years ago, I was
living in Vegas with this girl

20:09.606 --> 20:13.065
<i>Showgirl She was
in that show Elvis on Ice</i>

20:13.544 --> 20:19.038
Anywho, we drifted apart as people
do in these complicated times,

20:19.216 --> 20:22.777
and then a couple of months
ago, she shows up with Cool,

20:23.086 --> 20:27.717
tells me, "You watch him I shot
someone I have to leave the country"

20:30.628 --> 20:32.186
That's a parent?

20:33.330 --> 20:34.661
Anyway,

20:35.231 --> 20:38.962
we're back in town because I've
got something really huge cooking

20:39.036 --> 20:42.403
Enormo Monster
Dad, this is it!

20:42.940 --> 20:45.966
From now on, I'm going to
be taking care of all of you

20:46.110 --> 20:49.273
This isn't another get-rich-quick
scheme, is it, Larry?

20:50.247 --> 20:52.181
What's wrong
with getting rich quick?

20:52.249 --> 20:55.809
Quick is the best way to get
rich Look who I'm talking to

20:55.885 --> 20:57.547
Did you ever see
her family?

20:57.621 --> 21:01.317
They find a nickel, they huddle
together and bury it like squirrels

21:02.692 --> 21:05.253
What's the deal, son?
What do you have going?

21:06.596 --> 21:09.394
Has anyone heard
of hydroponics?

21:10.267 --> 21:11.928
Well, that's great, Larry

21:12.001 --> 21:15.802
Hydroponics is the growing of plants
without soil It's very exciting

21:16.140 --> 21:19.871
What are you using? Coarse
sand or suspension hydroponics?

21:20.076 --> 21:21.169
I don't

21:22.346 --> 21:24.576
There's a guy with glasses
and a lab coat

21:24.648 --> 21:26.843
that makes that decision
I make the deal

21:27.351 --> 21:31.754
And I got to thinking Cool's
had no kind of life, no family,

21:31.956 --> 21:34.355
so while I'm locking
this thing down,

21:34.424 --> 21:36.415
I thought it'd be nice
if we stayed with you

21:36.494 --> 21:38.222
With us?
Couple of weeks

21:38.328 --> 21:41.787
The thing is, Larry, we don't have
the big house anymore, you know?

21:41.865 --> 21:43.128
We didn't need it

21:43.200 --> 21:46.327
We just have the one bedroom
for us and one for Grandma

21:46.636 --> 21:49.366
Well, Grandma's welcome
to stay with us for a while

21:49.440 --> 21:53.342
I think it'd be valuable for Patty
to have a multigenerational influence

21:53.410 --> 21:54.968
Fine with me

21:55.312 --> 21:59.544
Well, I'll have to give you a list of
the medications, and when and how much,

21:59.616 --> 22:01.244
and you'll have to
pick up her shower chair

22:01.317 --> 22:05.311
There's the batteries for her hearing
aid, magnifying glass for reading

22:06.090 --> 22:07.216
Oh, jeez
What happened?

22:07.290 --> 22:09.019
Your mouth used up
all the power

22:09.093 --> 22:11.027
Don't worry, Dad,
we can still find the bar

22:11.095 --> 22:13.325
I'll get a flashlight
I'll get it, Sis

22:13.396 --> 22:14.489
Mom, Dad,
what happened?

22:14.565 --> 22:16.465
Where is it? In the bedroom?
It's in the nightstand

22:16.534 --> 22:18.501
Mom, Dad, what happened?
I'm getting a flashlight

22:18.568 --> 22:21.834
Kevin Kevin! You know I
don't like it in the dark

22:21.905 --> 22:22.963
Honey,
this is a blackout

22:23.039 --> 22:26.032
It's a temporary interruption in
the electrical supply of the home

22:26.110 --> 22:28.374
It's okay, honey
Something's busted Relax

22:28.546 --> 22:31.947
Where's the switch? Does
this look like my house?

22:32.016 --> 22:34.610
Here Bring it here
Oh, here it is

22:35.052 --> 22:36.712
What is this?

22:46.462 --> 22:48.055
Mommy, what was that?

22:48.265 --> 22:50.756
That was
an electric ear cleaner

22:51.335 --> 22:54.133
It was kind of big
It sure was

22:58.609 --> 23:01.338
I mean, I don't think you
really have to worry about it

23:01.511 --> 23:05.073
The point is that once they see us,
then they'll realize that we're fine,

23:05.149 --> 23:07.777
and the kid is fine,
and it's not something

23:12.021 --> 23:13.080
Gil

23:13.591 --> 23:14.682
Karen

23:15.893 --> 23:17.690
I think we're going to
have to be very careful

23:17.760 --> 23:20.457
about Kevin's
educational environment

23:21.030 --> 23:22.395
Absolutely

23:23.167 --> 23:24.191
With that in mind,

23:24.268 --> 23:26.759
I don't think Kevin should
come back here next fall

23:27.705 --> 23:30.003
I'm going to recommend that
he be transferred to a school

23:30.074 --> 23:32.736
that offers special
education classes

23:35.746 --> 23:37.737
You mean because
he's so smart?

23:38.315 --> 23:42.444
Actually, I mean a class for
children with emotional problems

23:46.657 --> 23:48.648
Hi I'm sorry I'm late

23:49.326 --> 23:52.056
You must be the Buckmans
I'm Dr Jeffrey Lucas

23:52.596 --> 23:54.894
Dr Lucas is
a child psychologist

23:54.999 --> 23:58.126
He's been observing Kevin
for the last couple of months

24:00.136 --> 24:01.297
Why?

24:02.506 --> 24:04.769
Mr Buckman,
this is a public school

24:05.709 --> 24:07.609
Thirty-eight kids
to a class

24:07.745 --> 24:10.475
We estimate that Kevin's
teacher spends at least

24:10.913 --> 24:13.780
20% of her time
dealing with Kevin

24:14.985 --> 24:18.317
That class is going to finish
the year behind It isn't fair

24:18.489 --> 24:23.153
Kevin is a very sweet, very
sensitive, extremely tense little boy

24:24.361 --> 24:26.385
He needs
some special attention

24:27.831 --> 24:30.391
It's 'cause he was first Mmm?

24:30.467 --> 24:32.401
It's because
he was our first

24:32.970 --> 24:35.768
I mean, I think we were very
tense when Kevin was little

24:35.838 --> 24:38.432
If he got a scratch,
we were hysterical

24:39.076 --> 24:42.135
By the third kid, you know,
you let them juggle knives

24:42.880 --> 24:45.973
On the other hand, Kevin may
have been like this in the womb

24:46.049 --> 24:49.315
Recent studies indicate that
these things are all chemical

24:50.854 --> 24:52.378
She smoked grass

24:52.923 --> 24:55.756
Gil! I never smoked
when I was pregnant

24:55.826 --> 24:57.418
Yeah, but in college,
you were like a chimney

24:57.494 --> 24:58.893
I thought you were
gonna join a reggae band

24:58.961 --> 25:00.087
Fifteen years ago

25:00.163 --> 25:02.689
I'm just saying there could've
been some chromosome distortions

25:02.766 --> 25:06.566
Well, you let them do anything You
let them watch TV just like that

25:06.636 --> 25:09.265
So we'll throw the TVs out We'll
put the TVs in the garbage, then,

25:09.338 --> 25:12.900
and you and I, we'll perform
works from Shakespeare or some

25:19.650 --> 25:21.048
I'm sorry

25:22.986 --> 25:25.250
I'm just a little
thrown off by this

25:27.423 --> 25:29.255
Gil Karen

25:30.693 --> 25:34.061
You should not look upon the fact that
Kevin will be going to a special school

25:34.131 --> 25:36.326
as any kind of failure
on your part

25:37.835 --> 25:39.564
No, I'll blame the dog

25:40.471 --> 25:44.305
In an educational environment
that's more sensitive to his needs

25:44.374 --> 25:47.901
All right, look First of all, Kevin
is not going to a special school

25:47.978 --> 25:50.538
Whether it's right or not,
there's a stigma

25:50.614 --> 25:52.605
People are cruel,
especially children,

25:52.682 --> 25:55.516
and I won't subject Kevin
to that kind of cruelty

25:56.886 --> 25:59.947
If we have to, we'll send
him to a private school

26:00.591 --> 26:03.423
I don't care what it costs
I'll get a second job

26:04.461 --> 26:08.659
Mr and Mrs Buckman, this is a
problem that won't just go away

26:09.266 --> 26:12.633
Well, if we need to, we'll send
Kevin to a private therapist

26:12.769 --> 26:16.297
That's right Look, it's a
problem We're aware of it,

26:17.341 --> 26:19.740
but we're his parents
We can handle it

26:21.845 --> 26:23.005
Well,

26:23.980 --> 26:27.815
the next school year is
four months off, so

26:28.684 --> 26:30.312
let's see
what can be accomplished

26:36.192 --> 26:38.661
Thank you
No! Tod Tod!

26:38.862 --> 26:42.923
I need to see No, not in
the street Please Please

26:53.977 --> 26:55.205
What is this?

26:55.278 --> 26:58.305
It's the party celebrating my
mother's promotion at the bank

26:58.382 --> 26:59.872
Give me that
Give me that

27:02.085 --> 27:05.520
Excuse me This is the wrong
batch This is my mother's

27:05.788 --> 27:08.348
There should be
another envelope for Buckman

27:08.525 --> 27:09.616
Okay

27:13.096 --> 27:14.893
That was picked up already

27:16.232 --> 27:18.097
By who?

27:20.037 --> 27:21.095
Huh

27:21.171 --> 27:22.160
Hmm

27:43.927 --> 27:48.728
I think this one is my
favorite This is just

27:50.167 --> 27:53.898
It was just for fun, Mom Well,
I'm glad to know it's not a job

27:55.005 --> 27:58.566
That's that Tod, isn't it? There's
one where you can see his face

27:58.741 --> 28:00.471
Is that what bothers you?

28:00.744 --> 28:03.076
That I did those things
or that I did them with Tod?

28:03.145 --> 28:06.479
Gee whiz, Julie, there's so many
things that bother me about this

28:06.549 --> 28:08.677
I don't know
how to separate them

28:09.186 --> 28:10.174
Oh!

28:10.354 --> 28:12.913
Ooh! Here's something
for my wallet

28:12.990 --> 28:17.359
Tod is very important to me And
we've got the pictures to prove it

28:17.928 --> 28:19.725
Mom!
This is your room

28:19.796 --> 28:23.731
You did these things
right here in my house?

28:23.834 --> 28:27.030
Well, I thought someone in this
house ought to be having sex

28:27.104 --> 28:29.629
I mean, with something that
doesn't require batteries

28:30.740 --> 28:34.734
What did you say to me? God
damn it, you get back here!

28:35.211 --> 28:37.771
Open this door,
God damn it to hell!

28:38.248 --> 28:42.308
I would just like a little
respect! Not a lot! Just a little!

28:43.120 --> 28:46.112
Do you know why I'm having sex
with machinery?

28:46.523 --> 28:50.516
Because your father left to have a
party, and I stayed to raise two kids

28:50.760 --> 28:54.128
I have no life! God damn it!

28:55.598 --> 28:57.032
What are you doing?

28:57.100 --> 28:59.295
I'm leaving before we
say things we'll regret

28:59.369 --> 29:02.201
You're gonna say something
worse than the battery remark?

29:02.271 --> 29:03.932
Tod and I are in love

29:04.841 --> 29:07.537
It's not "going steady"
love, it's love

29:07.644 --> 29:10.009
I need him
He's my life

29:10.413 --> 29:12.904
He touches me, and I quiver

29:13.450 --> 29:15.918
Oh, would you give me
just a small break?

29:16.053 --> 29:17.782
See? You can't handle it

29:18.422 --> 29:21.549
Tod's working now We'll find
a place to live somewhere

29:23.693 --> 29:25.183
Hi, Garry
Hi

29:26.196 --> 29:28.356
I'm moving out, Garry
Bye

29:28.664 --> 29:30.655
See? You've upset
your brother!

29:32.769 --> 29:34.293
Julie,
I'm telling you,

29:34.371 --> 29:36.362
if you walk out of this house
against my wishes,

29:36.440 --> 29:38.840
don't ever think
about coming back here

29:39.076 --> 29:40.168
Fine

29:52.689 --> 29:53.883
Julie!

29:54.290 --> 29:55.451
Julie!

29:55.859 --> 29:57.019
Julie!

29:57.259 --> 29:58.488
Honey

29:58.562 --> 30:00.722
Honey, I'm always here
if you need me

30:00.797 --> 30:01.923
Sweetheart!

30:02.164 --> 30:05.862
Honey, be careful If you
want anything, just call me!

30:06.169 --> 30:07.328
Julie!

30:08.605 --> 30:09.697
Bye

30:15.011 --> 30:16.343
Oh, man

30:18.315 --> 30:20.545
Incredible
Just incredible

30:21.351 --> 30:24.183
I knew you'd be the one
who'd appreciate this

30:25.422 --> 30:29.882
Three years, every night, every
weekend I had dinner out here!

30:30.527 --> 30:33.325
You know, it was a piece
of junk when I found it

30:33.797 --> 30:36.994
First time I got laid
was in a car like this

30:38.501 --> 30:39.969
Frank!
What?

30:40.504 --> 30:42.232
Cool just finished lunch

30:42.773 --> 30:44.468
I'll call the newspaper

30:46.209 --> 30:49.007
I thought you and Larry
could take him somewhere

30:49.312 --> 30:51.576
I am showing Larry my car

30:51.882 --> 30:53.543
Just plop him down
in front of the TV

30:53.682 --> 30:55.115
That's what he
always does

30:58.688 --> 31:02.419
Wasn't that Super Bowl incredible
right down to the last minute?

31:02.625 --> 31:03.854
Amazing

31:04.161 --> 31:06.721
They're usually not
that close, huh? Oh, no

31:06.797 --> 31:08.196
No, that's right,
and usually

31:08.265 --> 31:10.789
the winning team covers
the point spread Usually

31:10.866 --> 31:11.891
you can count on it

31:11.968 --> 31:15.164
Take a beating? No,
thanks I already took one

31:22.746 --> 31:26.511
Anyway, I had to pay off,
and it's left me a little

31:27.984 --> 31:29.508
What do you need?

31:31.354 --> 31:34.949
Come on, don't insult me I
didn't come here to be insulted

31:35.092 --> 31:36.991
Come on Come on

31:37.661 --> 31:41.757
Putting together a deal, you got to
look like you can piss with the big boys

31:42.098 --> 31:43.862
You see? You know

31:45.501 --> 31:46.866
How much?

31:48.071 --> 31:50.062
Couple of thousand
Three, tops

31:51.007 --> 31:52.030
Three?

31:52.275 --> 31:53.264
Tops

32:09.159 --> 32:10.250
Good

32:10.360 --> 32:12.884
You see, Grandma, Patty
studies Eastern philosophy

32:12.962 --> 32:16.660
Our future leaders are gonna have to be
much more in tune with the Oriental mind

32:16.732 --> 32:18.633
Okay, sweetie,
one more time

32:18.969 --> 32:21.528
Nathan, guess what?
Oh, you're home early

32:21.605 --> 32:23.129
Yeah, I have good news
What?

32:31.181 --> 32:32.511
What's up?

32:33.350 --> 32:35.284
I'm going to teach
summer school classes

32:35.352 --> 32:36.682
That means we'll have
vacation money

32:36.753 --> 32:38.117
Oh, that's great

32:41.357 --> 32:42.415
Mexico

32:42.491 --> 32:43.652
<i>Sí, sí</i>

32:45.362 --> 32:48.593
Gil and Karen are gonna take
Patty I just wanna call them

32:48.664 --> 32:52.431
Gee, honey, I'm really not too pro
on Patty spending a week with Gil

32:53.135 --> 32:54.728
Why not? They offered

32:55.138 --> 32:59.131
I'm a little concerned about his
jocularity I mean, he's a wonderful guy

32:59.375 --> 33:02.311
It's just he's a little, you know,
light-hearted about things that I

33:02.379 --> 33:04.903
That, you know,
that we consider important

33:06.082 --> 33:10.485
She has fun over there You
know, she scampers She cavorts

33:12.021 --> 33:14.855
Try this
We take Patty with us

33:15.091 --> 33:16.217
To Mexico?

33:16.293 --> 33:19.160
It's a perfect opportunity
to start her on Spanish

33:22.132 --> 33:23.690
It'll be fun

33:24.901 --> 33:26.266
Nathan

33:27.304 --> 33:29.534
I thought it would be nice
if you and I could be alone

33:29.605 --> 33:31.870
We will be
We'll get two rooms

33:37.614 --> 33:39.240
Which one will I be in?

33:39.615 --> 33:40.708
Patty

33:42.117 --> 33:44.278
That means
"come here" in Spanish!

33:44.386 --> 33:46.378
<i>Por favor Please</i>

33:46.456 --> 33:48.788
I want you
to listen to something

33:48.857 --> 33:51.053
I got a tape
of a mariachi band

33:51.394 --> 33:54.692
An authentic, indigenous,
native Mexican form of music

34:10.614 --> 34:12.706
Gil, good morning
Hello, Cindy

34:20.589 --> 34:21.954
When were you
gonna tell me?

34:22.992 --> 34:24.550
Tell you what?

34:24.693 --> 34:27.217
Lenny called this morning and
he said they were wondering

34:27.297 --> 34:30.197
where I thought we should take Phil
Richards to celebrate his partnership

34:30.266 --> 34:33.235
That Lenny is an asshole
Do you believe that guy?

34:33.302 --> 34:36.703
Nobody was supposed to have
that information until next month

34:37.072 --> 34:38.733
That partnership is mine

34:38.806 --> 34:40.502
You said it was just held up
by Ted's surgery,

34:40.576 --> 34:42.875
and then when he got back
you'd make it official

34:42.945 --> 34:46.710
Look, I never said you didn't do
great work You do terrific work

34:47.549 --> 34:49.277
Every firm does good work

34:49.818 --> 34:52.413
Look, I know you're
a lot smarter than Phil,

34:52.489 --> 34:54.422
but the guy works
like a Trojan

34:54.489 --> 34:57.550
He schmoozes clients
He brings in business

34:57.626 --> 35:00.754
He's here nights,
weekends I own the guy

35:00.829 --> 35:03.457
And that's what puts your name
on the door

35:04.266 --> 35:06.632
This is really
coming out of left field

35:06.835 --> 35:08.427
I've been here eight years

35:08.504 --> 35:11.201
I'm the backbone of the
operation I know that

35:11.774 --> 35:13.503
If I don't
get this partnership,

35:13.576 --> 35:15.770
I got to think about
going somewhere else

35:16.278 --> 35:19.806
I got to tell you, Gil I don't
consider that a realistic idea

35:19.882 --> 35:20.940
Why?

35:21.016 --> 35:22.347
You go somewhere else,

35:22.418 --> 35:25.410
you're gonna have to get in line
behind guys who are younger than you,

35:25.487 --> 35:27.785
who have been there longer,
who are more committed

35:27.856 --> 35:30.154
and who are willing
to work for less money

35:35.631 --> 35:40.159
Look, this thing with Phil
is not etched in stone

35:41.770 --> 35:44.170
I can jerk him along
for the next month

35:44.273 --> 35:46.798
Why don't you use that time
to give us your best shot?

35:46.875 --> 35:49.173
Put in the hours,
dazzle me

35:51.213 --> 35:52.737
Dazzle you?

35:58.855 --> 36:01.379
Listen, Dave, I'm
having a problem at home

36:02.091 --> 36:05.583
I really need to spend a lot of
extra time with my son right now

36:05.661 --> 36:07.788
Then I don't know
what we can do

36:09.698 --> 36:12.861
Get this guy! Get this guy!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

36:14.570 --> 36:15.559
Oh!

36:16.405 --> 36:19.772
<i>Well, they're bad dudes That's
why they call the game Bad Dudes</i>

36:19.842 --> 36:22.242
Okay, I should go stay with the
girls You got enough quarters?

36:22.311 --> 36:23.835
Yeah
Okay

36:24.747 --> 36:25.736
Dad?

36:26.281 --> 36:27.270
Yeah?

36:28.617 --> 36:30.812
How come I'm seeing
a psychiatrist?

36:35.324 --> 36:37.417
Yeah, we were gonna have
a big talk about that

36:37.493 --> 36:40.223
What's wrong with me?
Nothing Nothing

36:40.462 --> 36:42.259
You're great
Then how come

36:42.331 --> 36:43.525
Look

36:44.500 --> 36:45.797
Look

36:46.935 --> 36:51.065
You're a kid like I was You
have a lot of worries, that's all

36:51.140 --> 36:55.907
And these doctors, they're experts
at helping people with their worries

36:55.978 --> 36:57.969
It's nothing
to feel bad about

36:58.447 --> 37:01.939
Look, you're a great kid, and
I love you very much, okay?

37:02.652 --> 37:04.050
Okay
Okay

37:07.723 --> 37:09.054
You know what I think?

37:09.125 --> 37:11.855
I think this is gonna be
a great summer for you

37:12.161 --> 37:14.460
And don't forget you
got a birthday coming up

37:14.530 --> 37:16.964
Let's have a great party
That'll be fun, huh?

37:17.032 --> 37:19.557
Can we have Cowboy Dan?
Who?

37:19.635 --> 37:22.263
Cowboy Dan
The gun-fighting balloon man

37:22.337 --> 37:24.567
He was at Billy's party
He's cool

37:24.640 --> 37:27.768
Absolutely It's a done deal
This is your dad talking now

37:27.843 --> 37:29.640
Now, you've got me excited

37:29.978 --> 37:33.812
Okay, now, what do we say when we see
a cute eight-year-old girl walk by?

37:33.882 --> 37:36.214
Hubba-hubba
Hubba-hubba Okay

37:36.285 --> 37:40.051
Oh, don't tell your mom I taught
you that It could be bad Let's go

37:46.462 --> 37:47.759
Wow!

37:49.231 --> 37:52.962
You like it?
Yeah, it's good It's shiny

37:53.268 --> 37:57.136
Yeah! You know, it was
junk when I found it

37:58.774 --> 38:00.402
The first time
I got laid was in

38:00.476 --> 38:02.774
That's a story
for another time

38:16.326 --> 38:18.520
Hi, Dad Dinner ready?

38:19.328 --> 38:20.886
What was that?

38:21.029 --> 38:22.018
Huh?

38:22.464 --> 38:24.989
Oh, some friends
were just dropping me off

38:25.734 --> 38:28.726
Friends? Friends slow down
They even stop

38:31.807 --> 38:33.297
Dad

38:58.400 --> 38:59.890
Oh, Mommy

39:00.636 --> 39:02.570
Sweetie,
you're gonna be okay

39:05.607 --> 39:07.837
Honey, why would you
be panhandling?

39:09.378 --> 39:11.608
I needed money
for a place to stay

39:11.980 --> 39:13.971
Julie, you have
a place to stay

39:14.049 --> 39:16.279
I'd have to tell you
what happened

39:16.752 --> 39:19.949
What did happen? I just said
I didn't want to tell you

39:20.022 --> 39:22.286
Did you leave that Tod?
Yes

39:23.893 --> 39:26.986
He promised me he was gonna
start a house-painting business,

39:27.062 --> 39:29.189
then he said
he'd changed his mind

39:29.831 --> 39:32.857
He's gonna race dragsters
with his brothers

39:33.135 --> 39:34.932
He can't even drive
a regular car

39:37.139 --> 39:39.869
So his brothers came over
and we got in a fight

39:40.375 --> 39:43.867
He said, "No bitch is gonna
tell me what to do for a living"

39:48.250 --> 39:49.911
He told me he loved me

39:50.986 --> 39:52.510
Sweetie

39:53.956 --> 39:55.480
They say that,

39:57.359 --> 39:58.849
and then they come

40:00.395 --> 40:03.023
Honey, what can you expect
from a kid like that?

40:03.098 --> 40:07.558
Mom, back off The last guy
you dated stole our furniture

40:10.138 --> 40:12.629

Sherlock Holmes? I live here

41:03.792 --> 41:04.817
You live with me

41:05.961 --> 41:07.189
I wouldn't live with you

41:07.262 --> 41:10.390
if the world were flooded with
piss and you lived in a tree

41:10.465 --> 41:12.023
Excuse me, I'm going to the movies

All right, we're gonna
need a new second baseman

42:39.855 --> 42:42.949
Now, which one of you outfielders
wants to try second base, huh?

42:43.058 --> 42:44.047
Huh?

42:45.660 --> 42:48.527
How about you, Kevin?
You wanna try second base?

<i>And now it is my great pleasure
to introduce our valedictorian,</i>

43:50.692 --> 43:52.660
<i>Kevin Buckman</i>

44:09.377 --> 44:10.902
<i>Thank you</i>

44:11.313 --> 44:14.840
<i>You know, when I was nine years
old, I had kind of a rough time</i>

44:15.684 --> 44:18.312
<i>A lot of people thought
I was pretty mixed up</i>

44:18.753 --> 44:21.449
<i>But there was one person
who got me through it</i>

44:22.090 --> 44:24.058
<i>He did everything right</i>

44:24.593 --> 44:26.585
<i>And thanks to him, today,</i>

44:27.128 --> 44:29.824
<i>well, I'm the happiest,
most confident,</i>

44:30.632 --> 44:33.192
<i>and most well-adjusted person
in this world</i>

<i>Dad, I love you</i>

44:39.207 --> 44:40.697
<i>You're the greatest</i>

45:06.034 --> 45:07.467

45:31.660 --> 45:34.993

We're only one run down

45:38.266 --> 45:40.029
Now, you can do it Get
up there Come on, now

45:41.036 --> 45:43.197
Please, God,
let them win one game

45:48.677 --> 45:50.042
Got it!

45:57.185 --> 45:58.413
No!

46:02.457 --> 46:04.152
You stink, Buckman!

46:08.029 --> 46:09.929
He had no business
being out there!

46:09.998 --> 46:11.898
What's the matter with you?
No business!

46:12.768 --> 46:13.791
No!

46:14.369 --> 46:19.102
He had no business
being out there! Terrible!

46:32.153 --> 46:34.314
Why'd you make me
play second base?

46:52.607 --> 46:55.940
Someone's climbed to the roof
of the bell tower with a rifle!

46:56.011 --> 46:59.913
It's Kevin Buckman His
father totally screwed him up

47:00.281 --> 47:01.806
What's he yelling?

47:02.550 --> 47:05.110
You made me play
second base!

47:06.821 --> 47:10.279
<i>Kevin, I'm sorry
I did the best I could</i>

47:12.260 --> 47:15.821
Nice shot, son It's
important to be supportive

47:16.564 --> 47:18.657
Come on, let's sing
one of the old tunes

47:18.733 --> 47:20.360
<i>When you're sliding
into home</i>

47:20.435 --> 47:22.062
<i>And your pants
are full of foam</i>

47:22.137 --> 47:23.161
<i>Diarrhea</i>

47:49.564 --> 47:50.656
Well?

47:51.900 --> 47:54.528
Why are you pouring water
through my diaphragm?

47:54.736 --> 47:55.760
To check

47:56.172 --> 47:57.195
To see if it's okay

47:57.272 --> 47:59.399
You didn't know I did that, did you? No

47:59.474 --> 48:02.102
Obviously not, or you
wouldn't have tried this

48:02.844 --> 48:05.244
Are you accusing me
of making that hole?

48:05.480 --> 48:08.244
No, a woodpecker came in here,
went into the bathroom,

48:08.317 --> 48:09.614
opened the drawer
with his little wing,

48:09.684 --> 48:12.312
and pecked a couple of holes
in your diaphragm

48:12.487 --> 48:15.855
I can't believe you would jeopardize
our plans, Susan Remember what we read?

48:15.924 --> 48:17.893
"A vast majority
of truly exceptional people

48:17.960 --> 48:19.551
"are either only children
or first-born

48:19.627 --> 48:21.891
"with at least a five-year
separation between sibs"

48:21.963 --> 48:23.431
We agreed to
No, you agreed

48:23.498 --> 48:27.195
And they're not sibs They're
babies And I wanna have another one

48:27.402 --> 48:30.667
So, this is how you go about it, by
vandalizing a contraceptive device?

48:30.739 --> 48:32.672
Because you won't
discuss it with me!

48:32.740 --> 48:34.971
I did discuss it with you,
years ago!

48:35.043 --> 48:38.206
Well, I think we were wrong
Well, I think we were right

48:38.279 --> 48:39.712
And I'm not
discussing it again

48:42.817 --> 48:44.751
Tod!
Yeah

48:44.819 --> 48:46.548
Do you want me
to cook you breakfast?

48:46.621 --> 48:48.612
No, thanks, Helen
Julie's gonna do it

48:48.690 --> 48:50.989
Great I'll get
the fire extinguisher

48:51.126 --> 48:52.957
All right
I'll see you guys at dinner

48:53.795 --> 48:55.456
Sweet Jesus!

48:55.997 --> 48:58.864
What are you doing?
Are you joining the Marines?

49:02.471 --> 49:04.995
I knew you'd make
a thing out of this, Mom

49:05.473 --> 49:06.462
Just clean up the hair

49:08.210 --> 49:10.507
Wait
Do it like that

49:10.945 --> 49:14.540
Cool! No, I love it
Thanks so much

49:15.850 --> 49:18.478
You ready, Garry?
You want anything to eat?

49:18.887 --> 49:20.980
How long are they
gonna be living here?

49:21.056 --> 49:23.023
Not much longer, I think

49:24.792 --> 49:26.783
Well, I was
just thinking

49:28.062 --> 49:29.620
It's getting
pretty crowded here

49:30.231 --> 49:31.721
Oh, it's not so crowded

49:31.799 --> 49:33.768
There's a lot more room
since they shaved their heads

49:35.336 --> 49:37.065
Well, I was just thinking

49:38.473 --> 49:40.873
maybe I could stay
with Dad for a while

49:43.645 --> 49:44.737
What?

49:47.148 --> 49:51.210
Well, I've been here a long time Maybe
I should live with him for a while

49:52.855 --> 49:55.015
You wanna live
with your father?

49:56.858 --> 49:58.189
Kind of

50:02.364 --> 50:04.855
Have you talked
to your father about that?

50:06.501 --> 50:08.969
No, not yet

50:09.571 --> 50:10.936
I thought I'd call him

50:12.073 --> 50:13.165
Honey,

50:15.410 --> 50:18.072
you know, you don't know
your father like I do

50:18.146 --> 50:19.545
I don't know him at all

50:20.615 --> 50:21.605
What's his number?

50:25.153 --> 50:26.279
Well,

50:29.057 --> 50:30.991
he'd be at work now

50:32.227 --> 50:33.888
So that's

50:35.129 --> 50:40.965
206-5790

50:52.681 --> 50:55.376
Yeah, yeah
Is Dr Lampkin there?

50:56.518 --> 50:57.848
His son

51:05.393 --> 51:09.386
No, Dad, it's not Joey
It's Garry, your other son

51:11.432 --> 51:13.559
Well, I need
to ask you something

51:14.836 --> 51:16.030
It'll just take a second

51:18.473 --> 51:23.274
Well, would it be okay if
I stay with you for a while?

51:26.648 --> 51:28.115
A few months

51:39.961 --> 51:41.053
Okay

51:47.335 --> 51:49.634
Oh, Ed You shit

51:56.044 --> 51:57.033
He, um

51:58.713 --> 52:00.647
He didn't think it was
such a good idea

52:01.015 --> 52:02.346
Oh, sweetie

52:02.650 --> 52:04.277
I gotta go
Oh, honey

52:29.977 --> 52:32.411
Gil? Hey, Gil?
Yes, Miles?

52:32.480 --> 52:35.916
When's Cowboy Dan the gun-fighting
balloon man gonna be here?

52:35.983 --> 52:37.507
Isn't that him?

52:37.585 --> 52:40.486
No, that's the schmuck
who brought the horse

52:40.556 --> 52:42.045
I don't think
he's coming

52:42.123 --> 52:44.648
Yes, of course he is
The man's a professional

52:44.726 --> 52:49.060
Do you think he wants to put a blot on
the entire balloon-bending profession?

52:49.130 --> 52:52.190
Go on and have fun And we'll have
some burgers and dogs in a second

52:52.266 --> 52:54.860
Let's go watch the horse shit! Yeah!

53:00.875 --> 53:02.775
Patty, why don't you
play with Justin?

53:02.844 --> 53:05.404
I don't understand
what he's doing

53:06.013 --> 53:08.004
Well, he's spinning

53:08.349 --> 53:09.873
What for?

53:10.818 --> 53:12.513
No reason
Just for fun

53:14.522 --> 53:16.387
It doesn't look
like fun

53:17.458 --> 53:18.447
It isn't

53:20.428 --> 53:21.622
You tried it?

53:29.404 --> 53:31.429
So does Julie
have a nice place?

53:31.839 --> 53:35.775
Oh, yeah, yeah, she has a lovely
place Yeah, she has my place

53:36.844 --> 53:39.404
She and that Tod
are both living in my house

53:40.248 --> 53:41.476
Really?

53:42.283 --> 53:44.649
Well, actually
it was my idea

53:44.719 --> 53:48.382
You know, otherwise, she was
gonna quit school and get a job and

53:48.990 --> 53:52.050
I don't know Maybe this way,
she'll still go to college

53:53.428 --> 53:54.827
All right All right
All right All right

53:54.896 --> 53:56.056
Here we go
The thumb trick Ready?

53:56.130 --> 53:57.290
Thumb trick
Do the thumb trick

53:57.365 --> 53:59.663
Look at my thumb Ready?
Here we go Watch it Watch it

54:04.739 --> 54:05.831
What are you doing?

54:05.907 --> 54:07.500
Thumb trick
Show her, Dad

54:08.710 --> 54:11.872
Okay, but this is the
last time Here we go Ready?

54:26.060 --> 54:28.358
I mean, Justin's gonna
go full-time next year,

54:28.429 --> 54:31.297
so everybody's asking when
I'm gonna go back to work,

54:31.365 --> 54:32.889
like I'm supposed to

54:33.835 --> 54:37.635
And I'm thinking about it I mean,
I used to work It was okay, but

54:38.539 --> 54:40.632
You know, I think
I'm better at this

54:40.708 --> 54:43.643
I mean, I think I'm
sort of good at it, so

54:43.711 --> 54:45.440
But then, people make me
feel embarrassed,

54:45.513 --> 54:47.208
like I don't have
goals or something

54:48.616 --> 54:51.676
Like I sit around here
eating bonbons all day, right?

54:52.487 --> 54:54.853
Oh, I don't know
Well, what does Gil say?

54:55.022 --> 54:56.614
He says I should do
whatever I want

54:56.757 --> 54:58.247
I could've
killed him for that

54:58.993 --> 55:00.756
What are you
so upset about?

55:00.828 --> 55:04.195
Nathan, she's weird
She's a weird child

55:04.265 --> 55:06.826
I think a few days a week of
preschool could be very helpful

55:06.902 --> 55:08.732
This is not the right age for
Patty to be socially activated

55:08.803 --> 55:10.327
We went through it

55:10.404 --> 55:12.235
She's not a bomb
She's a little kid

55:12.306 --> 55:14.866
who has no ability to relate
to other little kids

55:14.942 --> 55:17.035
Do you want her
to relate to him?

55:18.813 --> 55:20.110
Help! Help! Help!

55:21.182 --> 55:24.015
See, when I met him,
I was a little wild

55:24.218 --> 55:25.879
I was a little
out of control

55:25.953 --> 55:28.888
and he kind of
took me in hand

55:29.557 --> 55:33.254
I liked that
He's very commanding

55:33.494 --> 55:36.657
He got me into teaching
He got my shit together

55:37.798 --> 55:39.857
Boy, he really
turned me on

55:40.167 --> 55:42.533
Really? I mean,
of course, really

55:42.737 --> 55:45.069
Oh, Nathan and I
used to be hot

55:45.673 --> 55:47.072
I know he doesn't
look it, but

55:47.442 --> 55:49.306
I mean,
we were like rabbits

55:49.377 --> 55:50.571
I used to give him,

55:51.779 --> 55:52.768
you know,

55:53.581 --> 55:54.707
oral,

55:54.949 --> 55:56.974
you know,
on the highway

55:58.586 --> 55:59.678
What?

56:00.556 --> 56:03.615
You know, he was always
trying to get a research grant

56:04.759 --> 56:06.784
And you thought
that would help?

56:07.795 --> 56:11.458
No, but I mean,
he kept getting turned down

56:11.632 --> 56:13.567
and he'd get real,
real tense

56:14.735 --> 56:17.704
So if I saw him getting,
you know, really tense,

56:17.772 --> 56:21.038
I'd just lean over while
he was driving and I'd

56:21.475 --> 56:22.567
Susan
What?

56:22.643 --> 56:23.667
I just spoke
to your mother

56:23.744 --> 56:25.507
Grandma wants to stay over
at Helen's for a while

56:25.580 --> 56:27.445
Can you drive her there
tomorrow?

56:27.515 --> 56:29.574
Sure
Great

56:46.000 --> 56:48.298
He likes to butt things
with his head

56:49.570 --> 56:51.538
How proud you must be

56:56.177 --> 56:58.442
Here it is Now it's right
there in front of you

56:58.512 --> 57:00.105
Okay Careful now
Careful

57:00.181 --> 57:01.341
Yeah!

57:10.791 --> 57:12.053
Here,
take this off

57:13.828 --> 57:15.728
Now really try
and hit it

57:16.497 --> 57:18.590
Yeah Really give it
a good shot

57:18.899 --> 57:20.059
Yeah Give it
a good whack!

57:20.335 --> 57:21.323
Whack!

57:21.827 --> 57:23.489
Put your shoulder into it
and whack it

57:24.130 --> 57:26.563
Now just kill it!
Kill it!

58:05.204 --> 58:06.228
When I was born,

58:06.304 --> 58:08.204
Grover Cleveland
was president

58:11.309 --> 58:13.106
I'm sorry I'm late

58:17.150 --> 58:18.708
Where should I do it?

58:19.786 --> 58:22.253
Who are you and
what are you going to do?

58:23.155 --> 58:25.021
I'm from Party Time
Entertainment

58:25.324 --> 58:26.552
I'm your stripper

58:27.760 --> 58:31.490
What's the birthday boy's name?
Because I paint it across my breasts

58:36.402 --> 58:39.996
Okay, it was a mix-up I got
Cowboy Dan's card and he got mine

58:40.206 --> 58:42.070
I'm sorry Goodbye,

58:42.141 --> 58:44.938
Wait a minute What about
Cowboy Dan? He is coming

58:45.010 --> 58:47.740
He showed up at the Lodge
Hall, and they were expecting me

58:47.813 --> 58:48.940
They beat him severely,

58:49.014 --> 58:50.380
so Cowboy Dan
ain't comingo

58:51.583 --> 58:53.278
Cowboy Dan's
not coming?

58:55.288 --> 58:56.846
Come on, Kevin,
hold it together

58:57.123 --> 58:58.112
I knew it

58:58.423 --> 58:59.413
I told you

58:59.724 --> 59:03.717
All the kids are gonna hate me It's
gonna be just like Little League

59:03.795 --> 59:05.320
Cowboy Dan is coming

59:05.664 --> 59:09.623
Gil! He's coming Cowboy Dan is coming!

59:26.751 --> 59:28.117
Howdy, partner

59:28.454 --> 59:31.081
You're Kevin's father!
You're not Cowboy Dan

59:31.157 --> 59:32.418
Yeah! 

59:33.025 --> 59:35.721
That's right
They call me Cowboy Gil,

59:37.295 --> 59:39.594
as in guilty

59:44.436 --> 59:48.498
I saw Cowboy Dan I didn't
like the look on his face

59:49.175 --> 59:50.199
It was like this,

59:50.675 --> 59:51.664
so I killed him

59:52.411 --> 59:53.434
I blew a hole in him 

59:54.012 --> 59:55.001
this big,

59:55.313 --> 59:57.407
That's too small

59:58.684 --> 01:00:00.947
Actually,
it was about this big

01:00:03.121 --> 01:00:06.489
You know, when I think about
it, that hole was about this big

01:00:09.628 --> 01:00:12.393
Yeah, and his guts were
spilled out all over the floor

01:00:13.699 --> 01:00:16.862
As I was walking away,
I slipped around on his guts

01:00:17.970 --> 01:00:22.304
And a couple of other people came by and
they started slipping on his guts, too

01:00:24.577 --> 01:00:28.376
After I blow a hole in somebody
and slip around on their guts,

01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:31.574
afterwards,
I always like to

01:00:32.284 --> 01:00:34.275
make balloon animals

01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:39.947
That's mighty
courteous of you

01:00:46.565 --> 01:00:47.963
Here we god

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.449
What's he doing?
I don't know

01:01:10.088 --> 01:01:11.681
Your lower intestines

01:01:20.932 --> 01:01:24.766
Watch out, you little varmints!
Why, you! You darned kids!

01:01:37.382 --> 01:01:40.978
Why, you little lily-livered
lumps of cat meat!

01:01:43.655 --> 01:01:46.181
Where's Cowboy Gil?
Where'd he go?

01:01:46.257 --> 01:01:48.885
Ambush, you little
four-footers

01:02:09.215 --> 01:02:11.978
And here it is It's made
with a quart of milk,

01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:14.416
two cups of sugar
and three cow pies

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:16.387
Come on and get it

01:02:16.454 --> 01:02:19.617
Will you get down off the
horse before you hurt yourself?

01:02:19.891 --> 01:02:21.757
Honey, I got to make
a big exit

01:02:21.827 --> 01:02:25.922
That's Cowboy Gil's woman
Take a bow, little lady

01:02:26.132 --> 01:02:28.224

Did you have
a nice birthday?

01:03:55.454 --> 01:03:57.614
Dad was funny
He sure was

01:03:58.623 --> 01:04:01.786
Well, good night,
nine-year-old boy

01:04:06.431 --> 01:04:08.023
Happy birthday, kiddo

01:04:09.168 --> 01:04:11.362
Dad?

01:04:12.003 --> 01:04:15.132
When I grow up,
can I work where you work?

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:16.771
Why?r

01:04:16.842 --> 01:04:19.811
That way we can still
see each other every day

01:04:28.853 --> 01:04:30.913
Good night
I love you 

01:04:31.322 --> 01:04:32.688
I love you, too

01:04:37.061 --> 01:04:38.050
Mom?n

01:04:39.731 --> 01:04:40.721
Hubba-hubba

01:05:40.759 --> 01:05:42.282
Garry?n

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:46.496
Garry?r

01:07:14.153 --> 01:07:16.280
<i>Let me out of here,
mango face!</i>

01:07:16.521 --> 01:07:18.114
Hello, Helen?h

01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:20.123
Oh, the door was unlocked

01:07:21.492 --> 01:07:22.481
Oh, my God!'

01:07:22.927 --> 01:07:26.385
What channel is this?
No, Gran, this is a tape

01:07:27.365 --> 01:07:29.061
She needs a mana

01:07:29.501 --> 01:07:30.489
Nowi

01:07:31.670 --> 01:07:34.230
Gran, this isn't mine
I don't watch this

01:07:38.077 --> 01:07:39.601
What's everybody
doing in here?

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.639
Did you break
my lock?

01:07:42.547 --> 01:07:45.038
Susie, Gran, would you
please go to my room?

01:07:45.117 --> 01:07:46.140
Sure

01:07:46.217 --> 01:07:50.847
One of those men reminded me
of your grandpa God bless him

01:07:52.757 --> 01:07:55.192
Garry, listen to me
How could you break my lock?

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.286
I came in here because I
was afraid you were on drugs

01:07:58.430 --> 01:08:00.363
Why would you think that?

01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:03.162
Because of what you did
to your father's offices

01:08:03.268 --> 01:08:04.427
What do you mean?

01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:06.703
He found your hammer

01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:10.002
You know, those were your
initials burned into the handle

01:08:10.175 --> 01:08:13.405
Someone must have taken it
Oh, Garry, just

01:08:13.479 --> 01:08:16.412
Honey, you know,
all these feelingsa

01:08:16.481 --> 01:08:19.381
You're right to have
all these feelings

01:08:19.716 --> 01:08:24.551
You're a great kid
You're a great kid, honey

01:08:25.122 --> 01:08:27.752
You just got a lousy dadt

01:08:28.594 --> 01:08:31.961
And you've just got to learn
to say, "The hell with him!"

01:08:35.367 --> 01:08:37.426
Actually, that's good
advice for both of us

01:08:38.368 --> 01:08:39.631
The hell with him!

01:08:44.877 --> 01:08:47.537
I don't know what to say
about the tapes

01:08:48.912 --> 01:08:51.644
You know, I assume that, you know,

01:08:51.716 --> 01:08:55.243
you're watching these because
you're curious about sex,

01:08:55.453 --> 01:08:57.613
you know,
or filmmaking,

01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:03.023
Is there anything
you'd like to ask? 

01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:06.024
Who? 

01:09:07.966 --> 01:09:08.953
Me

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:15.162
No, I don't blame you
What about Uncle Gil?

01:09:16.608 --> 01:09:18.439
He's busy
with his own kids 

01:09:19.645 --> 01:09:21.042
Hi
Hic

01:09:21.113 --> 01:09:23.081
Where's my wife?
She's still at school

01:09:23.148 --> 01:09:25.844
She's got cheerleading practice Bitchin'

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:28.108
So what's up? 

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:36.189
Would you like
to speak to Tod? 

01:09:55.613 --> 01:09:57.479
Can I speak frankly,
no holds barred?

01:09:58.583 --> 01:09:59.573
Pleased

01:10:00.519 --> 01:10:03.716
That is one messed-up
little dude

01:10:06.057 --> 01:10:07.992
You sure
we can talk straight?

01:10:09.927 --> 01:10:11.155
All rightu

01:10:16.368 --> 01:10:20.202
A few months ago,
Garry got his first boner

01:10:20.271 --> 01:10:22.001
You know what that is?h

01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.432
If memory servest

01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:27.945
Great! Anyway,
since then he's beenn

01:10:28.447 --> 01:10:29.435
uh,,

01:10:31.250 --> 01:10:34.185
slapping the salami
No offense

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:36.353
Noe

01:10:37.154 --> 01:10:39.588
Apparently, he's going
for a world record

01:10:39.658 --> 01:10:41.421
Chicken's burning 

01:10:41.659 --> 01:10:42.649
Oh!-

01:10:42.728 --> 01:10:43.717
Ohu

01:10:45.831 --> 01:10:48.663
Damn! That looked
good, tool

01:10:48.734 --> 01:10:50.429
Anyway,'

01:10:51.537 --> 01:10:53.731
he was afraid there was something
wrong with him, you know?

01:10:54.338 --> 01:10:56.533
Like he was a pervert
or somethingg

01:10:56.608 --> 01:11:01.636
I told him that's what little
dudes do We've all done it

01:11:02.346 --> 01:11:03.836
That made him happyo

01:11:05.149 --> 01:11:06.673
Garry was happy? 

01:11:07.452 --> 01:11:09.420
Yeah,
he even smiled

01:11:09.988 --> 01:11:11.979
I never even knew
he had teethm

01:11:14.826 --> 01:11:18.261
I guess a boy Garry's age
really needs a man around

01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:20.092
Yeah, well,

01:11:22.266 --> 01:11:25.725
it depends on the man
I had a man around

01:11:26.270 --> 01:11:30.229
He used to wake me up in the morning
by flicking lit cigarettes at my head

01:11:30.309 --> 01:11:33.904
"Hey, asshole, get up
and make me breakfast"

01:11:36.782 --> 01:11:42.378
You know, Miss Buckman, you need a
license to buy a dog or drive a car

01:11:42.453 --> 01:11:44.819
Hell, you need a license
to catch a fish,g

01:11:46.123 --> 01:11:49.252
but they'll let any
butt-reaming asshole be a father 

01:11:54.166 --> 01:11:57.192
Well, I'm gonna
pick up Julie

01:11:58.636 --> 01:12:00.695
They're hassling her
about her hairl

01:12:01.172 --> 01:12:03.003
She does look
kind of stupida

01:12:04.009 --> 01:12:06.944
I don't know what
we were thinking about

01:12:08.212 --> 01:12:09.270
Tod? 

01:12:13.051 --> 01:12:14.449

those quarters so fast?

01:12:58.229 --> 01:13:00.528

It's his retainer

01:13:41.372 --> 01:13:45.399
It's all right, sweetheart
Come on, sweetie We'll find it

01:13:49.648 --> 01:13:51.945

They'll wait with them
at our houset

01:14:09.266 --> 01:14:12.235
Oh, that's just what Kevin
needs, time alone with my dad

01:14:12.304 --> 01:14:13.793
Yuck!

Let's just goe

Gil, they're $200 

01:14:19.577 --> 01:14:22.307
If you dropped $200 in here,
you'd look, right?

01:14:23.748 --> 01:14:25.011
Yeah,

01:14:29.453 --> 01:14:31.649
Let's face it
He's getting worsen

01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:34.890
He has his good days,
and he has his bad days

01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:39.126
Why is he so high-strung?
He's like a poodle

01:14:39.197 --> 01:14:41.596
Everything's blown
out of proportion 

01:14:41.899 --> 01:14:44.390
Where does he get
this obsessive behavior?

01:14:48.105 --> 01:14:49.630
I wish I knewe

01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:54.104
They're gonna put him
in special edr

01:14:55.579 --> 01:14:57.878
Gil, what did you think?g

01:14:57.949 --> 01:15:01.817
That you'd dress up like a
cowboy and coach Little League,t

01:15:01.886 --> 01:15:03.252
and Kevin would be fine?y

01:15:03.922 --> 01:15:04.911
No 

01:15:05.890 --> 01:15:07.414
I mean, no, I didn'tr

01:15:10.561 --> 01:15:12.927
Yeah Yeah, okay, I didt

01:15:13.798 --> 01:15:17.131
Well, honey, you were
really kidding yourself

01:15:25.543 --> 01:15:29.980
You know, when your kid is
born, it can still be perfectt

01:15:30.949 --> 01:15:32.849
You haven't made
any mistakes yet

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:37.181
And then they grow up
to be likeh

01:15:38.856 --> 01:15:40.221
Like mea

01:15:48.265 --> 01:15:51.895
Oh, I'm gonna be home
late tomorrow How come?

01:15:52.604 --> 01:15:55.038
I'm attempting
to dazzle Dave

01:15:55.707 --> 01:15:59.699
I'm trying to put together
a major income-property thing

01:15:59.778 --> 01:16:01.904
for one of our
bigger clients

01:16:01.979 --> 01:16:03.606
Has Dave said anything?h

01:16:03.681 --> 01:16:05.615
Thursday when I left for
Little League, he said,

01:16:05.684 --> 01:16:08.050
"Let's all thank Gil
for stopping by"

01:16:08.119 --> 01:16:09.814
I didn't take it
as a good sign,

01:16:09.887 --> 01:16:13.288

Maybe I can do something
to help you relaxi

01:16:32.577 --> 01:16:33.805

Hi, Dad 

01:17:38.443 --> 01:17:39.967
Take the boy inside

01:17:43.914 --> 01:17:48.750
I couldn't resist I had to take it
out for a spin It purrs like a kitten

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:52.215
You're probably wondering why I
took it out without telling you

01:17:52.289 --> 01:17:55.282
I wanted to have it appraised so
that you'd know how much it was worth

01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:58.351
Only they can't appraise it
unless they have all the paperwork,

01:17:58.430 --> 01:18:01.422
the registration, the proof of
purchase You've got those things around?

01:18:01.498 --> 01:18:02.898
I'm not a schmuck!d

01:18:05.302 --> 01:18:07.237
You were going to
sell my car

01:18:08.238 --> 01:18:10.639
Sell Dadr

01:18:10.708 --> 01:18:14.167

anymore! It belittles us both!

01:18:16.146 --> 01:18:18.842
I want you
out of the house 

01:18:21.418 --> 01:18:23.216

Frigging basketball!

01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:44.565
This miserable son-of-a-bitch
rookie throws in a goddamn 50-footer

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.576
at the buzzer
It was a nightmarer

01:18:46.644 --> 01:18:49.613
It was like he reached
into my chest and ripped outt

01:18:49.681 --> 01:18:51.204
Oh, shut up! 

01:18:53.752 --> 01:18:55.048

01:19:06.331 --> 01:19:08.355
What about that 3,000
I gave you?n

01:19:08.967 --> 01:19:10.695
I took it to the trackl

01:19:11.935 --> 01:19:14.029
I wanted to run it up 

01:19:14.104 --> 01:19:15.902
so that I wouldn't have to
hit you for the whole amount 

01:19:15.974 --> 01:19:17.702
What the hell
is the matter with you?

01:19:17.775 --> 01:19:20.244
You're not a kid anymore!
You're not stupid!

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:22.836
Dad, I can't get a break

01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:26.442
I have been so close so
many times, I could touch it

01:19:26.518 --> 01:19:29.213
Did you ever think
about getting a job?

01:19:30.854 --> 01:19:32.117
Oh Greata

"Make your mark!

01:19:39.329 --> 01:19:41.297
"Don't be one of the
numbers Make your mark!"

01:19:41.365 --> 01:19:43.265
You misunderstood me!
You weren't listening! 

01:19:43.333 --> 01:19:46.064
Oh, come on, if I called
you up to tell you,

01:19:46.136 --> 01:19:49.230

little company,"

What do you mean

01:24:01.759 --> 01:24:02.747
Tod?e

01:24:04.194 --> 01:24:06.163
What is it with the
women in this family?

01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:09.096
They make all the men
in this family want to leave

01:24:12.804 --> 01:24:15.568
Well, if he thinks I'm having
his baby now, he's crazy!

01:24:20.545 --> 01:24:23.378
Baby? Your daughter's having a baby?S

01:24:23.514 --> 01:24:24.980
A baby?d

01:24:25.615 --> 01:24:27.345
You're gonna be
a grandma??

01:24:30.387 --> 01:24:32.253
No, no, no, no, no, nod

01:24:32.323 --> 01:24:36.020
I'm too young You know,
grandmothers are old 

01:24:36.094 --> 01:24:37.685
They bake, and they sew,u

01:24:37.761 --> 01:24:40.195
and they tell you stories
about the Depressionl

01:24:40.530 --> 01:24:45.059
I was at Woodstock, for
Christ's sake! I peed in a field!

01:24:45.136 --> 01:24:48.730
I've hung onto the Who's
helicopter as it flew away!

01:24:48.806 --> 01:24:50.739
I was at Woodstock

01:24:50.908 --> 01:24:53.934
Oh, yeah? I thought
you looked familiar!

01:24:57.715 --> 01:25:01.480
Gil, I've spoken
with Ted and Dan,

01:25:01.551 --> 01:25:06.818
and we have decided to
make Phil Richards a partner

01:25:10.461 --> 01:25:12.429
Holy shit!d

01:25:12.497 --> 01:25:14.590
Now, I know you're upset
Upset?y

01:25:15.365 --> 01:25:17.560
Haven't you seen the deals
I've been putting together?z

01:25:17.635 --> 01:25:21.662
I have been killing myself
I mean, aren't you dazzled?

01:25:22.506 --> 01:25:24.372
You still don't
get it, do you?

01:25:24.442 --> 01:25:30.381
Phil has just brought in three
brand-new multimillion-dollar clients

01:25:30.448 --> 01:25:35.248
He has spent the last month wining and
dining these guys, getting them laid

01:25:35.318 --> 01:25:37.947
He doesn't tell me
about problems with his kids

01:25:38.021 --> 01:25:40.012
I'm not even sure
if he has kids

01:25:40.091 --> 01:25:44.027
If this man's dick fell off,
he would still show up to work

01:25:44.095 --> 01:25:48.725
He is an animal That's
what dazzles, not the workl

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.462
You can't do what he does
You hate that shitd

01:25:53.671 --> 01:25:56.434
Now, Phil Richards
I quit!i

01:25:56.574 --> 01:25:59.372
Oh, Gil
Forget ith

01:25:59.644 --> 01:26:02.408
Phil brought you some
big clients You're happyt

01:26:02.479 --> 01:26:03.878
Oh, Gils

01:26:04.649 --> 01:26:07.345
I'm just going to call my clients,
give them the news, and I'm out of here

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:10.079
Friday's my last day
Don't make me a party

01:26:10.154 --> 01:26:11.246
Gil! 

01:26:12.422 --> 01:26:13.947
Dave!

01:26:20.997 --> 01:26:23.193
Hey, this is not
a playground, okay?

01:26:24.869 --> 01:26:26.461
Dad!t

01:26:27.137 --> 01:26:28.537
Daddy
Not now!t

01:26:28.605 --> 01:26:30.436
Okay
Not now!e

01:26:32.809 --> 01:26:34.333
Knock it off! 

01:26:38.983 --> 01:26:41.382
God, I can't believe
they did thisi

01:26:45.856 --> 01:26:49.054
All right, the other kids got
picked up, ours are watching a tape,

01:26:49.126 --> 01:26:51.993
and Helen just dropped
your Grandma off Let's talk

01:26:52.063 --> 01:26:53.654
I quit my job

01:26:56.833 --> 01:26:58.358
Why?a

01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:02.068
They gave the partnership
to Phil Richards

01:27:02.573 --> 01:27:06.235
Phil Richards, this is a guy
who leaves his wife and kids

01:27:06.309 --> 01:27:08.244
and then puts all his money
in his girlfriend's namet

01:27:08.311 --> 01:27:11.940
so they can't touch him for
child support I mean, the guy is

01:27:13.451 --> 01:27:16.283
Anyway, I couldn't
stand it I snapped

01:27:16.354 --> 01:27:18.583
Can you still
change your mind?p

01:27:18.655 --> 01:27:21.090
What do you mean,
change my mind? I quiti

01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:25.127
I know,
but did you say anythingr

01:27:25.195 --> 01:27:27.663
that would make it difficult
for them to take you back?

01:27:28.099 --> 01:27:31.899
Jesus, honey, I was hoping you'd be a
little more supportive It's not like I

01:27:31.969 --> 01:27:33.265
I'm pregnantt

01:27:46.617 --> 01:27:48.175
Since when?r

01:27:49.487 --> 01:27:53.287
Since I am
I'm due in Februaryo

01:27:53.524 --> 01:27:56.220
I didn't want to say
anything till I was sure

01:27:57.161 --> 01:27:58.958
How did this happen?h

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:00.554
It was an accident

01:28:02.365 --> 01:28:04.300
Anyhow, this is why
I'm sayingc

01:28:04.368 --> 01:28:06.666
maybe now this isn't
the best timet

01:28:06.737 --> 01:28:09.228
for you to be out of work
or starting a new job

01:28:09.306 --> 01:28:11.797
You know, if you'd told me there
was a chance of this happening,

01:28:11.876 --> 01:28:13.309
I might not have quit
in the first placeo

01:28:13.377 --> 01:28:16.038
Well, you never told me there
was a chance you might quit

01:28:16.113 --> 01:28:19.240
It was a spur-of-the-moment
decision Pretty big one

01:28:19.317 --> 01:28:20.716
So what are you saying
I should do?i

01:28:20.784 --> 01:28:24.345
Crawl back to work and kiss Dave's
feet and get my crappy job back?

01:28:24.422 --> 01:28:28.949
I quit! If I go back now,
they got me I'm a eunuch!

01:28:29.460 --> 01:28:32.452
You know, this puts a
minor crimp in my life, tooj

01:28:32.529 --> 01:28:36.261
I was thinking about starting back
to work in the fall Now I can't

01:28:38.402 --> 01:28:40.529
Well, that's the difference
between men and womeni

01:28:40.604 --> 01:28:43.038
Women have choices
Men have responsibilities

01:28:43.106 --> 01:28:45.268
Oh, really?

01:28:46.309 --> 01:28:48.335
Oh, okay, well, 

01:28:48.412 --> 01:28:53.076
then I choose for you to have
the baby, okay? That's my choice

01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:55.208
You have the baby
You get fat

01:28:55.286 --> 01:28:57.253
You breastfeed
till your nipples are soree

01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.753
I'll go back to work!

01:28:58.823 --> 01:29:02.588
All right, let's return from la-la
land because that ain't gonna happen

01:29:03.094 --> 01:29:05.391
And whether I crawl back to
Dave or I get another job,

01:29:05.462 --> 01:29:08.829
it's obvious now I'm going to
have to spend less time at home

01:29:08.899 --> 01:29:11.230
I'm gonna have to have
business dinners,k

01:29:11.301 --> 01:29:12.894
and I'm gonna have to
play racquetball,

01:29:12.970 --> 01:29:14.961
and I'm gonna have to
get guys laid,

01:29:15.038 --> 01:29:17.974
so I hope you don't mind if I
bring a few prostitutes home, honey,

01:29:18.042 --> 01:29:19.475
because that's what it
takes to get anywhere,

01:29:19.542 --> 01:29:21.703
and I'm not
getting anywhere,

01:29:21.779 --> 01:29:25.043
so whatever happens, you have
to count on less help from me

01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:29.217
Why don't you just say
what you're really thinking?s

01:29:29.319 --> 01:29:30.912
What am I thinking?n

01:29:31.922 --> 01:29:33.890
That I should have
an abortion?

01:29:37.094 --> 01:29:38.652
I didn't say thatt

01:29:39.363 --> 01:29:42.297
That's a decision every
woman has to make on her ownm

01:29:42.365 --> 01:29:44.926
What, are you running
for Congress?

01:29:45.002 --> 01:29:48.836
Don't give me that I want your
opinion about what we should do

01:29:48.905 --> 01:29:51.170
Let's pretend
it's your decision, okay?

01:29:51.242 --> 01:29:55.645
Pretend you're a caveman or your
father What do you want me to do?

01:30:00.016 --> 01:30:01.677
I wantT

01:30:05.588 --> 01:30:07.818
I want
whatever you wanth

01:30:07.891 --> 01:30:10.417
Well, I wanna have the babyt

01:30:11.095 --> 01:30:16.055
Well, great! Let's have it, then Let's
see how I can screw the fourth one up

01:30:16.132 --> 01:30:19.068
Hey, let's have five
Let's have six! 

01:30:19.136 --> 01:30:21.934
Let's have a dozen
and pretend they're donuts!

01:30:23.173 --> 01:30:26.769
I'm really happy about the way
things are turning out, aren't you?

01:30:27.444 --> 01:30:30.278
You know, with the
frame of mind you're in,r

01:30:30.346 --> 01:30:32.577
not only am I not sure
we should have another baby,y

01:30:32.649 --> 01:30:34.810
I'm not sure we should
keep the three we've got

01:30:34.885 --> 01:30:36.181
Well, I'm ready
to discuss it

01:30:36.319 --> 01:30:37.378
However, I can't right now 

01:30:37.454 --> 01:30:39.615
because I gotta go
to the goddamn Little Leaguer

01:30:39.690 --> 01:30:41.213
Ten little boys
are waiting for me

01:30:41.291 --> 01:30:42.850
to guide them
into last place 

01:30:42.926 --> 01:30:44.655
You really have to go?f

01:30:45.261 --> 01:30:47.855
My whole life is "have to"r

01:30:49.165 --> 01:30:50.792
Come on, Kevin,
get your glovem

01:30:50.868 --> 01:30:53.199
You said I didn't
have to play anymore

01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:55.703
I know what I said, but
now I'm changing my minde

01:30:55.773 --> 01:30:58.240
If I have to go, you have to go Move it!

01:30:58.908 --> 01:31:00.637
Kevin,
this one's for you

01:31:05.315 --> 01:31:08.376
Get behind the ball
It's easier to come in

01:31:08.451 --> 01:31:11.784
Hi, Dad What are you
doing here?

01:31:11.956 --> 01:31:13.422
Karen said
you were hereo

01:31:14.692 --> 01:31:16.989
Can I speak to you
a second?g

01:31:17.094 --> 01:31:18.083
Yeah

01:31:18.962 --> 01:31:21.487
Hey, Wayne, can you take over a second?

01:31:26.936 --> 01:31:28.234
What's up?

01:31:29.539 --> 01:31:31.064
I need your advice

01:31:33.511 --> 01:31:36.207
Wait a second My head
is spinning Come on

01:31:37.247 --> 01:31:39.147
Look,,

01:31:39.216 --> 01:31:44.118
Larry needs $26,000 or
gamblers are gonna kill him

01:31:45.922 --> 01:31:47.514
Jesus! 

01:31:47.591 --> 01:31:50.617
I'm supposed to decide
whether to give it to him

01:31:54.764 --> 01:31:56.561
And you want my advice?

01:31:58.601 --> 01:32:00.569
Why me? Why now?

01:32:00.637 --> 01:32:03.198
Because I know you think
I was a shitty father

01:32:19.022 --> 01:32:20.922
Thank you
for not arguingh

01:32:21.725 --> 01:32:24.216
And I know you're a
good father, so, tell me, 

01:32:25.061 --> 01:32:26.393
what would you do? 

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.828
You got
that kind of money?n

01:32:32.036 --> 01:32:33.024
I got it,h

01:32:34.370 --> 01:32:35.701
but it's gonna hurtl

01:32:36.105 --> 01:32:39.871
I wanted to retire next year
This'll put that off for a while,

01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:42.202
a long whileu

01:32:45.548 --> 01:32:47.539
I never
should've had four

01:32:50.086 --> 01:32:52.180
You know, when you were
two years old,

01:32:53.523 --> 01:32:55.013
we thought
you had polioe

01:32:56.460 --> 01:32:57.984
You know about that?w

01:32:59.195 --> 01:33:02.359
Yeah, Mom once said
something Yeah, well,

01:33:02.498 --> 01:33:05.467
for a week,
we didn't knowl

01:33:07.203 --> 01:33:08.761
I hated you for thatn

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:11.466
What?
I didt

01:33:12.542 --> 01:33:17.037
I did I hated
having to go through that

01:33:17.113 --> 01:33:22.415
The caring, the worrying,
the pain,y

01:33:23.987 --> 01:33:25.546
that's not for mep

01:33:26.656 --> 01:33:30.353
You know, it's not
like that all ends

01:33:30.426 --> 01:33:33.987
when you're 18
or 21 or 41 or 61t

01:33:34.064 --> 01:33:37.795
It never, never ends

01:33:39.002 --> 01:33:40.629
It's like
your Aunt Edna's asst

01:33:40.703 --> 01:33:43.332
It goes on forever,
and it's just as frightening

01:33:45.275 --> 01:33:46.538
It's true

01:33:47.011 --> 01:33:48.477
There is no
end zoneh

01:33:49.245 --> 01:33:53.909
You never cross the goal line, spike
the ball and do your touchdown dance

01:33:54.317 --> 01:33:55.306
Never

01:33:58.454 --> 01:34:01.753
I'm 64,

01:34:03.527 --> 01:34:05.790

01:34:12.835 --> 01:34:14.895
like Kevin is your sonr

01:34:17.307 --> 01:34:19.037
Do you think
I want him to get hurt?e

01:34:21.177 --> 01:34:22.405
He's my sone

Who's to say
who's a shitty father?

01:34:48.338 --> 01:34:50.000
Kevin's in therapy

01:34:51.074 --> 01:34:54.532
We got called to school last year
because Taylor was kissing all the boys

01:34:54.610 --> 01:34:57.272
Justin keeps ramming things
with his head 

01:34:57.948 --> 01:34:59.779
My career is
in the shithouse 

01:35:04.754 --> 01:35:06.119
You worry too muchr

01:35:07.890 --> 01:35:09.188

We agree to pay them
$1,000 a monthi

01:38:12.876 --> 01:38:17.005
They're businessmen They'll see
that something is better than nothings

About an hour ago, I got a phone

Big opportunity

Oh, Jesus,

I want you to come home
This is very bad for Patty

I love you, Susane

01:41:28.104 --> 01:41:30.868
Those are words
They don't solve anything

01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:33.238
I can compromise
I can change

01:41:35.244 --> 01:41:38.145
Nathan, I don't think
you're capable of changeu

01:41:50.693 --> 01:41:53.663
Okay, come on, we're way behind

Dave called He was crying
He actually criedu

01:49:34.990 --> 01:49:37.424
He said if I'd come back,
they'd give me a corner office

01:49:37.493 --> 01:49:39.119
with new furniture
and a raise,

01:49:39.194 --> 01:49:41.253
like that's supposed
to make up for everything

01:49:41.663 --> 01:49:44.929
Anyway, I took the job
I couldn't thinks

01:49:45.001 --> 01:49:47.298
I was still high
from the Little League game

01:49:48.304 --> 01:49:49.770
Isn't that demented,s

01:49:49.905 --> 01:49:51.430
that a grown man's
happiness depends

01:49:51.506 --> 01:49:53.975
on whether a nine-year-old
catches a pop-up?

01:49:54.042 --> 01:49:56.876
I mean, what if he missed? But he didn't

01:49:56.945 --> 01:49:58.606
But he could have
But he didn'tr

01:49:58.681 --> 01:50:01.206
But he could have
But he didn't, Gil!o

01:50:01.850 --> 01:50:04.877
You threw him 12 million
pop-ups in the backyard

01:50:04.953 --> 01:50:06.682
You cut the odds
considerablyv

01:50:07.155 --> 01:50:08.145
If he hadn'ty

01:50:09.893 --> 01:50:13.420
But there's three of them,
and you wanna have four,

01:50:14.564 --> 01:50:17.498
and the fourth one
could be Larry, 

01:50:18.001 --> 01:50:19.695
and they're gonna do
a lot of things 

01:50:20.136 --> 01:50:22.103
I mean, baseball's
the least of it

01:50:22.171 --> 01:50:24.867
And in all those things,
sometimes they're going to miss

01:50:24.940 --> 01:50:27.636
Sometimes they won't
Sometimes they will

01:50:27.710 --> 01:50:29.439
Sometimes they won't
Sometimes they will

01:50:29.511 --> 01:50:31.570
What do you want me
to give you, guarantees?

01:50:31.647 --> 01:50:35.674
These are kids, not
appliances Life is messy

01:50:36.485 --> 01:50:37.918
I hate messy

01:50:38.854 --> 01:50:40.322
It's so messyi

01:50:40.989 --> 01:50:45.119
You know, when I was 19, Grandpa
took me on a roller coaster

01:50:46.796 --> 01:50:48.194
Oh?e

01:50:48.263 --> 01:50:53.759
Up, down, up, down
Oh, what a ridel

01:50:55.805 --> 01:50:56.998
What a great story

01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.474
I always wanted
to go againe

01:50:59.541 --> 01:51:05.002
You know, it was just interesting to me
that a ride could make me so frightened,

01:51:05.514 --> 01:51:08.484
so scared, so sick,

01:51:08.917 --> 01:51:10.407
so excitede

01:51:10.485 --> 01:51:12.920
and so thrilled,
all togethero

01:51:15.057 --> 01:51:16.490
Some didn't like ita

01:51:17.726 --> 01:51:19.627
They went
on the merry-go-round

01:51:21.698 --> 01:51:24.791
That just goes
around Nothing

01:51:26.702 --> 01:51:30.867
I like the roller coaster
You get more out of it

01:51:34.943 --> 01:51:37.913
Well, I'll be seeing you
