-Thank you.

Emcee:
Laurel, everybody.

22:00.474 --> 22:02.057
How about
we take a short break?

22:02.891 --> 22:04.724
You didn't have
to stay for that.

22:05.349 --> 22:06.933
Well, I, um,

22:07.766 --> 22:10.766
I had a bunch more
questions to ask you, so...

22:10.849 --> 22:12.808
I get louder every week.

22:12.891 --> 22:15.432
It's just good for me to do
something in front of people.

22:15.641 --> 22:17.849
I spend a lot of time
with dead animals.

22:18.140 --> 22:19.891
I thought you
were just won--

22:20.974 --> 22:22.265
Um...

22:22.891 --> 22:24.432
What size are your feet?

22:24.808 --> 22:26.766
-This to do with Daniel?
-Oh, I-I can't tell you--

22:26.849 --> 22:29.349
-Or are you gonna
buy me shoes?
-(laughing) No!

22:29.808 --> 22:31.474
No, I am not gonna...

22:31.557 --> 22:33.933
-buy you anything.
-What'd you find?

22:34.265 --> 22:35.849
I-I can't tell you that.

22:35.933 --> 22:37.683
Well, a-a footprint.
Uh--

22:37.766 --> 22:40.099
So, if you could
just tell me, uh...

22:40.182 --> 22:42.641
-what size your--
-So you can eliminate me?

22:43.641 --> 22:45.099
-I can't--
-Do you think I did it?

22:45.182 --> 22:47.599
I-- I ca-- No.

22:48.641 --> 22:50.724
-But if you tell me
your shoe--
-Eight.

22:51.599 --> 22:52.933
Thank you.

22:54.099 --> 22:55.224
Eight.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.057
Eight...

22:57.641 --> 22:59.557
And then if there's
anything else you
could tell me about

22:59.641 --> 23:01.766
the two people
that you met.

23:03.099 --> 23:05.808
Yeah, she-- she had
a pretty name.

23:06.265 --> 23:07.641
Like a jewel or something.

23:07.724 --> 23:09.516
I-I can't remember.

23:09.599 --> 23:11.224
-That's all I got.
-Okay.

23:11.724 --> 23:14.516
A needy blonde
and a guy
in a woman's coat.

23:15.599 --> 23:16.766
Um...

23:17.974 --> 23:19.307
Thank you.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.307
-So, you off duty?
-Um...

23:23.933 --> 23:26.015
Yeah, I guess. Yeah.

23:26.099 --> 23:27.265
What do you want?

23:28.474 --> 23:31.808
Well, seeing as
you won't buy me
a drink, it's on me.

23:34.099 --> 23:36.808
-You wanna have
a drink with me?
-Sure.

23:38.766 --> 23:42.140
Okay. But I would like
to buy you the-the drink.

24:00.974 --> 24:04.307
-(sighs)
-There's a sheriffy-looking
person over there.

24:05.557 --> 24:07.182
That's convenient.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.349
You, uh,

24:10.724 --> 24:13.015
you okay down there?
You were gone a while.

24:14.849 --> 24:16.474
Found this.

24:17.933 --> 24:19.766
I was getting
all sentimental,

24:19.849 --> 24:22.474
looking up where we'd be now
if we were still on it.

24:23.140 --> 24:24.808
Where would we be?

24:26.391 --> 24:27.808
The next town.

24:28.891 --> 24:30.224
Really?

24:30.307 --> 24:32.516
Thought we'd be further
along than that.

24:33.015 --> 24:36.015
Uh, it's on
a... a stopover.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.724
They just...

24:38.391 --> 24:40.724
wait for, like, six hours.

24:42.182 --> 24:45.766
-Our train is,
like, one town away?
-Yep. (laughs)

24:47.307 --> 24:49.182
-Just sittin' there?
-Yep.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.683
I mean, if we
got on it now...

24:53.724 --> 24:56.265
(laughs) you know,
it'd be like we never got off.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.766
We could get your coat.

25:02.891 --> 25:05.474
-I-I do love that fucking coat.
-I know.

25:05.557 --> 25:06.891
(both laugh)

25:15.265 --> 25:17.557
I think we should
get to Union Station.

25:19.432 --> 25:21.557
Like we always
said we would.

25:22.099 --> 25:24.265
-That's the only
promise we made.
-We said we were gonna--

25:24.349 --> 25:26.808
You know, we can call
them from the train.

25:31.307 --> 25:33.391
That sheriff's coming over.
Why are you doing this?

25:33.474 --> 25:35.766
If we don't get to LA,
we end here.

25:37.766 --> 25:39.557
I don't wanna end here.

25:43.432 --> 25:44.808
Run.

25:47.307 --> 25:49.391
Don't say that
unless you mean it.
