fights mostly.

08:58.102 --> 08:59.800

are we looking at?

said to me in the hospital,

09:03.064 --> 09:06.763
that whatever this was, he said
that he needed it to happen.

09:06.807 --> 09:10.985
- So maybe he was
experimenting sexually.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.595
- It's possible
that he had an encounter

09:12.639 --> 09:14.336
with a predator upstate.

09:14.379 --> 09:17.557
I mean, it's not uncommon for
a teenage boy to wander off.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.562

on the ball and swung.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.215

11:34.128 --> 11:36.173
He probably gets
a massage after.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.435
- Massages, I don't know.

11:37.479 --> 11:38.741
Seems like a waste
of time to me.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.439
- You obviously
never had a good one.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.268
You never had one at all.

11:44.312 --> 11:45.269
Here's our guy.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.228
- Gus Haverford, NYPD.

11:47.271 --> 11:50.144
- We need to talk to you
about Sam Conway.

11:51.493 --> 11:55.323
- I swear to God, I didn't
know he was 15 years old.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.630
Kid was messed up.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.937
I had the Uber
take him home.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.547
Ask the driver.

12:02.591 --> 12:03.766
- Yeah, well,
the driver says

12:03.810 --> 12:05.463
that you had your hands
all over him.

12:05.507 --> 12:07.117
I was trying
to comfort the kid.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.292
He was crying.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
- Well, what was
he crying about?

12:09.816 --> 12:11.643
- How he didn't want
to go home.

12:11.687 --> 12:13.776
I thought he was afraid
he'd get busted by his parents

12:13.820 --> 12:14.559
for being drunk.

12:16.474 --> 12:20.435
He...seemed more worried
about his brother.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.047
He was hysterical, rambling.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.920
Something about a rabbit.

12:30.227 --> 12:32.316
Something did happen
on that hunting trip.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.971
- White people and rifles.
Don't ask me.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.930
- He didn't want to shoot it.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.803
- That was it.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.065
And if you have
any more questions,

12:42.109 --> 12:43.980
I'm calling my lawyer.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.985
- It's not unheard of.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.814
- Talk to him

12:51.858 --> 12:53.860
away from his parents.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.867
- Hey, Brian, can I talk to you
for a minute?

13:00.910 --> 13:02.869
- I have baseball practice
at Riverside Park.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.044
The bus is leaving.

13:04.087 --> 13:06.698
- This won't take long.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.747
- I already told you guys
everything.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.140
I answered
all your questions.

13:13.183 --> 13:14.402
Can't you just leave
my family alone?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.012
- No, we can't do that.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.145
Why don't you just tell me what
happened on your hunting trip?

13:18.188 --> 13:19.276
- Nothing.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.539
That's not
what I heard.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.585
Sam seemed
to be upset, okay,

13:23.628 --> 13:26.675
to the point where he went
to a bar and got drunk.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.372
- You can't tell
our parents about that.

13:28.416 --> 13:29.852
I don't want him
to get in trouble.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.941
- So you know he left
the apartment Sunday?

13:31.985 --> 13:34.074
- I-I was worried sick.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.858
He came home, threw up
all over the bathroom.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.555
I cleaned it up
and put him to bed.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.296
- What happened to him,
Brian?

13:39.340 --> 13:41.646
- Nothing, that's it.

13:41.690 --> 13:42.996
- Look, look, look,
Brian, Brian,

13:43.039 --> 13:44.780
man-to-man.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.349
Come on, man.
His injuries, the bleeding.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.351
That didn't happen
from a fall

13:50.394 --> 13:52.875
and that wasn't sex
gone wrong.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.050
Your brother was raped.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.052
Do you know what that means?

13:56.096 --> 13:57.314
- My brother's not gay.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.404
- What are you saying,
that I--

14:00.448 --> 14:01.928
that I raped
my own little brother?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.844
- You--you
people are sick.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.236
I did not--no.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.288
- Your brother
didn't want to shoot.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.945
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:18.988 --> 14:19.989
Look, I can't miss practice.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.035
I got to go, okay?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.473
- Fin talked to Brian.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.301
Now, he didn't admit anything.
- But he knows what happened.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.998
- Fin says yes.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.218
- So we call
Child Protective Services,

14:31.261 --> 14:32.784
open up an investigation.

14:32.828 --> 14:35.396
- Without Sam's cooperation,
that's--

14:35.439 --> 14:37.920
that's gonna be
a very difficult case, guys.

14:37.964 --> 14:39.617
I'm sorry.
- I'll make some calls.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.837
There's got to be
something.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.019
- Amanda, look,

14:50.063 --> 14:52.152
whatever is--
is going on with you,

14:52.195 --> 14:54.719
you're either gonna tell me
or you're not gonna tell me,

14:54.763 --> 14:56.286
and I don't want
to invade your privacy

14:56.330 --> 14:58.419
or ask you questions that,
you know, as your boss,

14:58.462 --> 14:59.463
I shouldn't even
be asking you, so--

14:59.507 --> 15:01.988
- I'm pregnant.

15:05.034 --> 15:06.383
- Wow.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.735
Oh, congratulations.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.565
Or--

15:14.609 --> 15:15.958
- Hey, the school just called.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.874
Sam and Brian
got into some kind of fight.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.967
- Brian went after Sam.
We tried to stop it.

15:25.011 --> 15:26.838
Not a word!

15:26.882 --> 15:29.319
- Parents weren't answering.
I didn't know who else to call.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.582
- Brian!
- Get away from him!

15:31.626 --> 15:33.149
Get off of him!

15:33.193 --> 15:34.672
Hey, Sam, you okay?

15:34.716 --> 15:36.674
- You need to calm down.
- I didn't do it.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.111
He's being a baby.
- Calm down--

15:38.154 --> 15:39.590
Hey!

15:42.898 --> 15:45.292
♪

15:45.335 --> 15:46.684
Ah--

15:46.728 --> 15:48.948
- I got him, Lieu!

15:48.991 --> 15:51.167
- Ow!

15:51.211 --> 15:53.387
- Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.997
- I didn't touch him.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.956
- It's over! Stop it!
- I didn't touch him--please!

15:58.435 --> 16:03.223
- SVU portable, I need a bus
at 120th and Madison.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.007
I'm so sorry.
Try not to move.

16:05.051 --> 16:06.878
Help is on the way
right now.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.271
Hang in there.

16:08.315 --> 16:11.535
Help is on the way right now.

16:15.017 --> 16:15.148
.

16:15.191 --> 16:17.846
- You're really gonna talk
to him without his parents?

16:17.889 --> 16:19.239
- He's 17, and he hasn't
asked for a lawyer.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.675
- You really think
he's going to confess

16:20.718 --> 16:22.111
to assaulting
his younger brother?

16:22.155 --> 16:23.895
- I think that whatever
is going on in that family,

16:23.939 --> 16:26.028
I think that Brian
is drowning too.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.857
Maybe he's looking
for a lifeline.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.643
- Maybe I should call my dad.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.949
- You don't really
want your dad

16:33.993 --> 16:36.952
to hear what you're
about to say, do you?

16:36.996 --> 16:39.694
I didn't think so.

16:39.737 --> 16:41.130
- Brian, we want to help you.

16:41.174 --> 16:42.566
He doesn't.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.307
- I do.

16:44.351 --> 16:47.136
I know there's things you don't
want to talk about, right?

16:47.180 --> 16:48.616
Things you can't talk about,

16:48.659 --> 16:51.314
so let's start with the things
you can talk about.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.403
Okay?

16:53.447 --> 16:55.057
- Look, I love Sam.

16:55.101 --> 16:56.667
I would never really hurt him.

16:56.711 --> 16:57.929
- I see that.

16:57.973 --> 16:59.540
He's your brother.

16:59.583 --> 17:03.283
I'm gonna ask you about this
hunting trip this past weekend.

17:07.548 --> 17:10.246
You and your dad
go hunting together a lot?

17:10.290 --> 17:14.250
- My dad, he shot a boar once.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.687
It was charging him.
He could have been killed.

17:16.731 --> 17:17.993
- Wow.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.041
- He had a clear shot.
He could have--

17:22.084 --> 17:23.346
- You're his big brother,

17:23.390 --> 17:25.044
so you had to teach him
a lesson, right?

17:25.087 --> 17:27.394
- Is that why you did
to Sam what you did

17:27.437 --> 17:29.483
and why you were
beating up on him,

17:29.526 --> 17:31.050
to keep him quiet?

17:33.182 --> 17:34.705
- My boys love each other.

17:34.749 --> 17:38.013
Whatever they were fighting
about, brothers fight.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.884
- So I hear.
I only have sisters.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.061
- Brian didn't
do anything, okay?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.627
- Why was he
attacking you, Sam?

17:43.671 --> 17:45.499
Because to me, it looked like
he was either trying

17:45.542 --> 17:47.936
to kill you or he was trying
to shut you up about something.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.592
- Sam's father
is gonna join.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.205
- Is that okay
with you, Sam?

17:56.249 --> 17:59.295
- Um, y-yeah,
that's--that's fine.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.689
- Molly, you want
to take a break?

18:01.732 --> 18:03.691
- I'm fine.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.475
- Okay, then.
Let's--

18:05.519 --> 18:06.998
- I have something
to tell you.

18:07.042 --> 18:09.479
We have something
to tell you.

18:09.523 --> 18:12.874
My son came out to me
this morning.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.137
- He's gay.

18:15.181 --> 18:18.706
He met a young man
on the trip.

18:18.749 --> 18:19.968
One thing led to another.

18:20.011 --> 18:22.231
But we talked it out,
me and Sam.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.711
I'm good.
He's good.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.191
We're just going
to keep talking,

18:25.234 --> 18:28.281
maybe go to counseling
as a family, right, Sam?

18:28.324 --> 18:29.369
- Right.

18:29.412 --> 18:32.415
- But, Sam,
there was bruising.

18:32.459 --> 18:35.505
You were bleeding,
so whatever happened, it--

18:35.549 --> 18:37.116
- You told me
you were drunk, son?

18:37.159 --> 18:39.553
- Um, yeah,
um, I was drunk,

18:39.596 --> 18:43.252
and, I mean,
things got a little rough.

18:43.296 --> 18:47.082
But I--I--I wasn't
hurt or anything.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.260
- Um, I didn't get a name.

18:52.957 --> 18:54.916
How old was he?

18:54.959 --> 18:56.526
Where did this happen
exactly?

18:56.570 --> 18:58.485
- My son doesn't need
to be interrogated,

18:58.528 --> 19:00.878
unless being homosexual
is a crime.

19:00.922 --> 19:02.576
I'm sure that's not
what you're saying.

19:02.619 --> 19:06.623
- No, that's not, but what we
are saying is that your son

19:06.667 --> 19:09.322
is too young to consent.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.802
- We've answered
enough questions.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.154
I'm taking my family home.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.168
- We can both agree that
that was a load of crap.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.604
Sam was drunk,
met some guy in the woods?

19:30.647 --> 19:32.432
The father's protecting
his older son.

19:32.475 --> 19:34.564
- I already put a call
into Child Protective Services.

19:34.608 --> 19:36.000
- We got to get Sam
out of that apartment.

19:36.044 --> 19:37.437
We got to get him
away from Brian.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.917
- I'll ask Family Court
about an emergency order.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.615
I'll keep you posted.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.227
We canvass friends,
relatives?

19:45.271 --> 19:47.403
See if anybody
knows anything?

19:47.447 --> 19:49.318
- Something like this,
people don't want to know.

19:49.362 --> 19:52.974
- The mother knows,

19:53.017 --> 19:56.064
Molly.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.460
- I can't talk to you.

20:00.503 --> 20:02.288
My family will be home soon!

20:02.331 --> 20:04.333
- Where exactly is your family
right now, Mrs. Conway?

20:04.377 --> 20:05.769
- John took them
out for pizza.

20:05.813 --> 20:08.032
Like we have something
to celebrate.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.470
- And you didn't go.

20:10.513 --> 20:14.125
That's--that's a lot
of dinners to get through.

20:14.169 --> 20:16.258
I mean, your boys
won't be out of the house

20:16.302 --> 20:18.478
for, what, three,
three or four more years?

20:18.521 --> 20:20.219
Pretending
that everything's okay.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.698
- We'll get through this.

20:21.742 --> 20:25.049
- Yeah, well, your husband,
maybe, and Brian,

20:25.093 --> 20:28.270
but...what about Sam?

20:28.314 --> 20:32.231
I'm just curious how
you're going to

20:32.274 --> 20:34.276
get through
looking into your son's eyes

20:34.320 --> 20:35.625
at the dinner table

20:35.669 --> 20:38.715
or when you're saying
good night to him

20:38.759 --> 20:43.546
knowing that he knows that
his mother didn't protect him,

20:43.590 --> 20:45.200
his mother
didn't keep him safe.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.855
- Please.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.077
What can I do?

20:53.121 --> 20:55.689
- Tell us what happened.

20:56.777 --> 21:03.174
- That night...I heard sounds
from Sam's room.

21:03.218 --> 21:05.829
I was listening at the door.
I could hear Sam.

21:05.873 --> 21:09.050
He was...

21:09.093 --> 21:12.314
whimpering like an animal.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.098
It broke my heart.

21:14.142 --> 21:16.275
- Okay.

21:16.318 --> 21:19.365
So, okay, what did you do?

21:19.408 --> 21:22.281
- I called Sam's name,
but there was no answer,

21:22.324 --> 21:23.934
so I opened the door

21:23.978 --> 21:28.983
and Sam,
he was just...on the bed

21:29.026 --> 21:32.378
and he...

21:32.421 --> 21:35.163
was standing there
zipping his pants.

21:35.206 --> 21:36.817
- Brian was.

21:36.860 --> 21:38.601
- My husband!

21:38.645 --> 21:42.170
John just walked out
like nothing happened.

21:42.213 --> 21:45.304
I asked Sam
if he was okay,

21:45.347 --> 21:48.176
and...he just yelled at me.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.570
"Just leave me alone.
Go!"

21:50.613 --> 21:54.095
Later, in bed, John said,
"Don't say a word.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.792
"Not a word.

21:55.836 --> 21:58.360
Sam's fine."

21:58.404 --> 22:01.494
The next day,
the boys went to school.

22:01.537 --> 22:05.802
John left for work
like everything was fine.

22:05.846 --> 22:10.067
I...I searched Sam's room.

22:10.111 --> 22:12.461
I found underwear
in his closet.

22:12.505 --> 22:16.987
It was wet,
and there was blood.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.992
- John told me to throw them
into the washer.

22:22.036 --> 22:26.910
I-I closed my eyes.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.477
I shut my mouth.

22:28.521 --> 22:32.829
I pretended I didn't
see what I saw.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.484
He's always...
been tough on the boys.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.095
He's strict, but this--

22:38.139 --> 22:40.228
- Molly, honey,
we missed you!

22:40.271 --> 22:43.013
We got pizza
to go instead.

22:43.057 --> 22:44.841
We can all eat together.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.234
The hell is going on?

22:46.277 --> 22:47.757
- Mr. Conway, turn around.

22:47.801 --> 22:49.672
- You're under arrest.

22:50.543 --> 22:53.241
- The rape of your son.

22:57.288 --> 23:04.513
♪

23:07.864 --> 23:08.038
.

23:08.082 --> 23:10.911
- Let me tell you something
about my wife, pal.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.652
She tends to agree with
the last person she spoke to.

23:12.695 --> 23:14.088
- You're saying that your wife
doesn't have a mind of her own.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.350
- I'm saying
one of you bastards

23:15.394 --> 23:16.569
put this garbage
in her head.

23:16.612 --> 23:17.874
- The truth is, pal,

23:17.918 --> 23:19.267
we never considered this.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.442
- Because it's sick!

23:20.486 --> 23:21.487
- Calm down.
- Calm!

23:21.530 --> 23:23.314
No one's saying you're--

23:23.358 --> 23:27.188
Damn it, I can't even
say the words!

23:32.759 --> 23:34.717
Do you hunt, Mr. Stone?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.589
- That's irrelevant.

23:36.632 --> 23:40.288
- That's where you're wrong.

23:41.942 --> 23:45.815
There's a moment when
you're hiding in the brush,

23:45.859 --> 23:49.602
that deer picking berries off
a tree not 50 yards from you.

23:49.645 --> 23:53.388
It's like...the world stops.

23:54.955 --> 23:59.089
All that exists are two souls:

23:59.133 --> 24:02.049
the hunter and the hunted.

24:02.092 --> 24:05.661
You try not to breathe,
but the deer,

24:05.705 --> 24:08.142
he hears your heart beating,

24:08.185 --> 24:09.535
the blood
running through the fingers

24:09.578 --> 24:11.188
folded around the trigger.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.886
He looks up.

24:12.929 --> 24:16.977
An instant of silence
and slow time.

24:19.588 --> 24:23.853
The first to flinch loses.

24:25.551 --> 24:28.510
I have served
in the military.

24:28.554 --> 24:32.383
I've built a business up
from nothing by myself.

24:32.427 --> 24:33.384
- That's enough, John.

24:33.428 --> 24:34.690
- My point is,

24:34.734 --> 24:38.346
I don't flinch.

24:46.746 --> 24:47.877
- They're Sam's.

24:47.921 --> 24:49.705
They're the ones
that he was wearing

24:49.749 --> 24:51.881
the night you raped him.

24:51.925 --> 24:53.100
And you should know

24:53.143 --> 24:54.797
that they have
your DNA on them.

24:54.841 --> 24:58.801
- Without corroboration,
they're meaningless.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.151
- And unlike my wife,

25:01.195 --> 25:03.197
my boy has a mind
of his own.

25:03.240 --> 25:04.285
- Let's go.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.732
- Toughest thing in all
the sports, hitting that curve.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.691
- When are you people
going to leave me alone?

25:18.734 --> 25:20.475
Huh?

25:20.519 --> 25:23.086
I need to concentrate.

25:23.130 --> 25:24.566
- You know,
I used to play.

25:24.610 --> 25:26.568
A long time ago,
Little League.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.788
Still a huge fan, though.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.704
I love the perfection
of this game.

25:31.747 --> 25:33.836
Nice,
double off the wall.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.709
- Look, you're wasting
your time, okay?

25:36.752 --> 25:38.754
My dad didn't
do anything to me.

25:38.798 --> 25:40.800
- Sam,
your mom said that--

25:40.843 --> 25:43.237
- I don't--
she gets confused.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.764
- You know,
hoops was my game.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.636
In high school,
I played the point.

25:50.679 --> 25:55.205
Wasn't much of a shooter,
but, man, I could dish.

25:55.249 --> 25:56.642
That wasn't good enough
for my old man, though.

25:56.685 --> 25:59.209
He used to bust my balls
about passing up shots.

25:59.253 --> 26:00.559
Wide open in the paint,

26:00.602 --> 26:02.082
and I'd still pass
to this pimply kid

26:02.125 --> 26:03.562
at the top of the key
who--

26:03.605 --> 26:07.609
This kid could not
hit the ocean from a boat.

26:07.653 --> 26:11.134
Truth is, half the time I
did it just to piss off my dad.

26:11.178 --> 26:13.136
- So your old man didn't
know squat about basketball.

26:13.180 --> 26:15.878
- More like he didn't
know anything about me.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.184
And I knew
even less about him.

26:17.227 --> 26:18.489
Neither one of us
had the guts to ask.

26:18.533 --> 26:22.102
- Well, me and my dad
aren't like that.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.236
- We talk and stuff.
I--

26:29.196 --> 26:31.198
- We--

26:31.677 --> 26:35.855
- Yeah, see, I figure that's
why they invented sports,

26:35.898 --> 26:40.120
so dads would have something
to talk about with their sons.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.643
But when they
don't talk, Sam--

26:41.687 --> 26:43.340
- Let it go.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.168
Let it go.
- I can't.

26:45.212 --> 26:46.909
I can't do that, Sam.

26:46.953 --> 26:50.870
Your mother saw your father
in your room.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.523
She told us.

26:55.614 --> 27:02.316
♪

27:05.362 --> 27:08.191
- We were just talking!
I--I told you that.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.150
Something you obviously
wouldn't know anything about.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.586
Just because
you had a screwed-up life

27:11.630 --> 27:12.848
doesn't mean everyone did.

27:12.892 --> 27:14.328
- Hey, hey, Sam, Sam.

27:14.371 --> 27:17.853
- Look, my dad would never
hurt me, okay?

27:17.897 --> 27:20.639
And I'll never say
that he did.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.557
- You know, the kid
is--is clearly traumatized.

27:26.601 --> 27:29.691
Carisi says that he wants
to tell us what happened,

27:29.735 --> 27:32.215
but he's just too afraid.

27:32.259 --> 27:34.653
- What kind of a world
is this, Olivia?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.178
- I guess there
has to be a hell

27:38.221 --> 27:40.702
so we can recognize heaven.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.617
- "Suffer the little children
to come unto me."

27:42.661 --> 27:44.097
See, that always baffled me.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.489
If children have to be suffered
to approach God,

27:45.533 --> 27:47.970
what kind of a world
has He created?

27:48.014 --> 27:49.624
If they have to suffer
to be close to Him,

27:49.668 --> 27:51.365
what sort of a heaven
does He reside in?

27:51.408 --> 27:58.589
- Peter, if you ever want
or need to talk about Pam,

27:58.633 --> 27:59.939
I'm here.

28:02.768 --> 28:06.162
- She's dead.
What's to say?

28:09.035 --> 28:10.906
We're going to trial
against John Conway.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.604
- Without
a complaining witness.

28:13.648 --> 28:17.217
- The war you can't win
is the only one worth fighting.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.708
- A diphenylamine indicator
confirmed the presence

28:29.751 --> 28:33.233
of two distinct DNA samples
on the victim's undergarment.

28:33.276 --> 28:35.626
- Can I assume that one
of the DNA samples was Sam's?

28:35.670 --> 28:38.238
- Yes, it was extracted
from a blood cell.

28:39.674 --> 28:42.198
- It was extracted
from a semen sample.

28:42.242 --> 28:45.419
We matched it to the defendant,
John Conway.

28:49.162 --> 28:50.337
Are you aware,
Mr. Fitzsimmons,

28:50.380 --> 28:51.642
that that
particular undergarment

28:51.686 --> 28:53.601
was washed
before you tested it?

28:53.644 --> 28:57.474
- Yes, but it's settled science
that under normal conditions,

28:57.518 --> 29:00.869
a washing machine does
not destroy pre-existing DNA.

29:00.913 --> 29:02.697
- Do you know
if any other clothing

29:02.741 --> 29:04.090
was in the washing machine

29:04.133 --> 29:05.526
along with people's
exhibit number one?

29:05.569 --> 29:08.181
- Yes, I believe
it contained garments

29:08.224 --> 29:09.791
belonging to each
of the family members.

29:09.835 --> 29:12.446
- In your professional opinion,
Mr. Fitzsimmons,

29:12.489 --> 29:14.709
is it possible
that the defendant's DNA

29:14.753 --> 29:18.669
could have been transferred
during a wash cycle

29:18.713 --> 29:20.410
to his son's underwear?

29:20.454 --> 29:23.413
- Yes, tests have shown
that's possible.

29:23.457 --> 29:24.719
- Possible.

29:24.763 --> 29:25.938
How about likely?

29:25.981 --> 29:28.201
- Under certain conditions.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.770
- Thank you.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.905
- The people call Molly Conway.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.820
- Objection,
spousal privilege.

29:38.864 --> 29:40.996
- We'll take a recess.

29:41.040 --> 29:44.391
Counsel, join me
in my chambers.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.002
- It's textbook law.

29:47.046 --> 29:48.743
You cannot compel the wife

29:48.787 --> 29:50.527
to testify against her husband.
- Nobody's compelling her.

29:50.571 --> 29:52.094
- Well, she wants to testify.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.356
- With bells on.
- Oh, come on.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.662
Reread the hornbook,
counselor.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.446
The public policy
behind this privilege

29:56.490 --> 29:58.840
is to promote free
and open communication

29:58.884 --> 30:00.146
between the spouses.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.364
In other words,
it goes both ways.

30:01.408 --> 30:02.757
Doesn't matter
what she wants.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.367
He can compel her
to sit down and shut up.

30:04.411 --> 30:05.934
- Not when it involves
a crime against a child.

30:05.978 --> 30:07.327
I don't see a crime.

30:07.370 --> 30:08.719
Even the so-called victim
doesn't see one.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.199
- What, the child
isn't going to testify?

30:10.243 --> 30:11.505
- He's scared of his father,
Judge.

30:11.548 --> 30:13.681
- Or this entire thing
is a crock.

30:13.724 --> 30:16.423
Either way, allowing
Mrs. Conway to testify

30:16.466 --> 30:18.251
is more prejudicial
than it is probative.

30:18.294 --> 30:20.209
- I'm sorry, Mr. Stone.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.732
Without
a complaining witness,

30:21.776 --> 30:23.430
I'm forced to sustain
Mr. Karey's objection.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.693
Mrs. Conway cannot
testify against her husband.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.564
- Glad we had this talk.

30:31.264 --> 30:32.787
- I just heard
from the hospital.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.007
The woman on the bike, the one
that Brian knocked over,

30:35.050 --> 30:36.138
she's being released.

30:37.792 --> 30:41.274
- Aside from being in a cast
for the next three months?

30:46.148 --> 30:47.584
You know, Fin,
I'm a mom and a cop.

30:47.628 --> 30:49.064
That's it.
That's who I am.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.631
- That's more than most.

30:50.674 --> 30:54.200
- And what happens
when I wake up in the morning

30:54.243 --> 30:55.897
and I can't do
one of those things?

30:55.941 --> 30:57.333
Does that make me

30:57.377 --> 30:59.248
half the person that
I was the night before?

30:59.292 --> 31:01.120
- Well, excuse me
for being redundant,

31:01.163 --> 31:02.469
but you're still
more than most.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.471
- That's very nice
of you to say.

31:04.514 --> 31:08.954
But the fact of the matter is,
the truth is,

31:08.997 --> 31:11.695
I got winded.

31:11.739 --> 31:14.829
I was chasing that Conway kid
and I--

31:14.873 --> 31:16.918
I had to stop.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.789
And now an innocent woman
who was riding her bike

31:18.833 --> 31:22.576
has a broken leg because of--
because of me.

31:22.619 --> 31:24.621
- And no matter how much
you sucked for air,

31:24.665 --> 31:25.840
you couldn't
fill your lungs.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.102
- That's right.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.017
- And your legs
felt like lead.

31:29.061 --> 31:30.323
- Bingo.

31:30.366 --> 31:32.281
- Welcome to the club.

31:32.325 --> 31:36.198
Liv, no one expects you
to be Wonder Woman.

31:36.242 --> 31:38.157
- I do.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.420
- Yeah, well, and I used
to think I was Superman.

31:41.812 --> 31:44.293
- Life.

31:45.251 --> 31:48.645
Time.

31:48.689 --> 31:51.344
I mean,
what you gonna do?

32:01.920 --> 32:06.141
♪

32:09.449 --> 32:11.277
- Help yourself.
- I thought you only drank beer

32:11.320 --> 32:13.192
during a trial.
- Well, this one's

32:13.235 --> 32:14.758
basically over.
- You had to know

32:14.802 --> 32:16.064
that judge
wasn't going to let a wife

32:16.108 --> 32:18.371
testify against her husband.

32:18.414 --> 32:20.721
- I never underestimate the
bias or ignorance of judges.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.332
- And we had to get an honest
and intelligent one.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.163
Want to tell me
about Sam?

32:28.207 --> 32:29.686
- Well, he's terrified
of his old man

32:29.730 --> 32:31.427
and he's embarrassed by him.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.516
- It's par for the course.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.736
- Tell me about it.

32:38.304 --> 32:39.696
- You know, if I can
get Sam on the stand

32:39.740 --> 32:41.350
and talk to him man-to-man--

32:41.394 --> 32:42.656
- Yeah, but without
his mother's testimony,

32:42.699 --> 32:45.006
Karey's got no reason
to call him.

32:45.050 --> 32:46.616
That ship has sailed.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.883
- Maybe I can grab the line
before it's too far from shore.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.588
- Nah, I got this one.
Go home.

33:02.763 --> 33:05.418
How much is this gonna hurt me?

33:09.378 --> 33:11.772
How long has he been here?

33:18.779 --> 33:18.997
.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.520
- The people call Molly Conway.

33:22.217 --> 33:24.915
Did someone hit the replay
button when I wasn't looking?

33:30.878 --> 33:32.836
- I'm too young
for a senior moment.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.013
I know I ruled
on this yesterday, Mr. Stone.

33:35.056 --> 33:37.276
- Circumstances have changed,
Your Honor.

33:37.319 --> 33:39.017
- What, they got
a quickie divorce?

33:39.060 --> 33:40.975
Not that it would matter.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.672
- Because Mrs. Conway
tampered with evidence

33:42.716 --> 33:44.326
and misled the police,

33:44.370 --> 33:46.850
she was acting so as to advance
a mutual criminal conspiracy.

33:46.894 --> 33:48.417
- You would have to charge her.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.812
- I've charged her with being
an unindicted co-conspirator.

33:53.901 --> 33:57.122
Their communications
are no longer protected.

33:57.165 --> 33:59.602
Very clever.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.517
Mrs. Conway can testify.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.041
- Your Honor.

34:05.086 --> 34:07.088
And what did you see,
Mrs. Conway?

34:07.132 --> 34:10.874
- Sam rushing to sit up
in his bed.

34:10.918 --> 34:14.008
His face was white
as a ghost.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.750
There were tears
running down his cheeks.

34:18.752 --> 34:24.932
- My husband...
was standing over the bed.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.806
It looked like
he was fastening his belt.

34:33.375 --> 34:39.816
- Later, in bed, he told me
not to tell anyone what I saw.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.562
- Hmm.

34:46.606 --> 34:49.261
That's a story,
Mrs. Conway.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.566
- It's true.

34:50.610 --> 34:51.828
- Did you tell it to the nurse

34:51.872 --> 34:53.221
when you were called
to school?

34:53.265 --> 34:54.744
- No.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.572
- No.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.531
- To the police, the first time
you spoke with them?

34:58.574 --> 35:00.924
- It all happened so quickly.
I needed time.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.622
- To formulate
such a convincing tale.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.189
- Object--
- Withdrawn.

35:04.232 --> 35:07.409
Did you tell this story
to the police

35:07.453 --> 35:09.324
the first time
that you spoke to them?

35:13.459 --> 35:15.330
- No.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.247
- I just wanted it to go away.

35:19.291 --> 35:24.339
- Did you tell them
the second time you saw them,

35:24.383 --> 35:26.298
Mrs. Conway?

35:30.998 --> 35:33.305
No.

35:33.348 --> 35:38.658
- In fact, you never told
the police that John raped Sam,

35:38.701 --> 35:39.963
right?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.621
- I just told them
what I saw.

35:45.665 --> 35:50.974
- So you don't know what
actually happened in that room?

35:51.018 --> 35:52.846
No.

35:54.543 --> 35:56.850
- Thank you.

35:59.896 --> 36:01.376
- I love her,
I--I do,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.291
but sometimes, my mom,
she just--

36:03.335 --> 36:05.032
she doesn't know
what she's saying.

36:05.075 --> 36:06.816
Me and Dad,
we were just talking.

36:07.991 --> 36:09.993
- He was--
I don't know.

36:10.037 --> 36:11.865
He was just trying
to console me.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.954
You know,
I-I was feeling bad

36:13.997 --> 36:16.043
'cause I couldn't
shoot this rabbit,

36:16.086 --> 36:18.524
and, um, and he was just
telling me that it's okay,

36:18.567 --> 36:21.962
that some guys just
aren't cut out for hunting.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.051
- Hmm.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.576
Did he assault you, Sam?

36:29.274 --> 36:32.059
- No, no, that's--
that's ridiculous.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.409
- So how did you
get the injuries

36:34.453 --> 36:39.545
that Mr. Stone
has repeatedly called

36:39.588 --> 36:42.330
indications of rape?

36:45.812 --> 36:47.640
Do I have to?

36:47.683 --> 36:51.121
Yeah, you do.

36:54.299 --> 36:59.391
- Um, so I met a man.

37:01.262 --> 37:05.962
And...it was the first time.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.138
I-I-I wanted him to,
you know.

37:08.182 --> 37:11.533
It wasn't rape
or anything like that.

37:11.577 --> 37:14.580
- Thank you.

37:20.716 --> 37:21.891
What was that guy's name?

37:21.935 --> 37:24.503
- Um, I don't remember.

37:24.546 --> 37:25.852
- That's odd.

37:25.895 --> 37:27.549
Your first time, I think
you'd remember everything.

37:27.593 --> 37:30.683
- Well, nobody cares
what you think, Counselor.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.252
Sustained.

37:35.557 --> 37:37.864
- Tell me about
the hunting trip.

37:39.126 --> 37:40.258
- Whatever you remember.

37:40.301 --> 37:41.563
- Well, I remember it all.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.871
- Right, because
it was your first time.

37:44.914 --> 37:47.090
The first time you went out
in the woods with your dad,

37:47.134 --> 37:48.178
your brother, and a rifle.

37:48.222 --> 37:49.876
It was a big deal,

37:49.919 --> 37:51.312
kind of like the first time
you had sex.

37:51.356 --> 37:52.574
- Objection.
- My point is--

37:52.618 --> 37:54.228
the witness
remembers everything

37:54.272 --> 37:55.577
about his first hunting trip

37:55.621 --> 37:57.144
and nothing about
the first time he had sex,

37:57.187 --> 37:58.188
and they happened
on the same weekend.

37:59.973 --> 38:02.367
Everyone's making it out
to be something that it's not.

38:02.410 --> 38:04.325
I-it's just sex.
Everyone does it.

38:04.369 --> 38:05.718
- Not with their father,
they don't.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.110
- Objection!

38:07.154 --> 38:08.286
- That's not just sex, Sam.
It's rape.

38:08.329 --> 38:10.462
- Your Honor.
- That's enough.

38:10.505 --> 38:12.246
Mr. Stone.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.988
- Was going hunting
with your dad a big deal?

38:16.076 --> 38:18.339
- To Dad, it was.

38:19.862 --> 38:21.560
- But not to you.

38:23.518 --> 38:29.045
- Well...Dad killed a moose
when he was 12.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.091
Brian killed a deer
when he was 15.

38:31.134 --> 38:34.312
- In your family,
it's a rite of passage.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.357
- Yeah, it's how
you become a man.

38:36.401 --> 38:40.187
- How did you feel before
you tried to shoot the rabbit?

38:40.230 --> 38:42.624
In that moment
when time stands still

38:42.668 --> 38:46.498
and it was just you,
the rabbit, and your rifle?

38:46.541 --> 38:48.587
- Um...

38:48.630 --> 38:49.936
I--I don't--I don't know.

38:52.286 --> 38:54.636
Yeah, maybe, a little.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.726
- No, no, of course not.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.339
Were you scared of Brian?

39:05.691 --> 39:09.129
There was only one other
person there, Sam.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.351
Were you scared
of your dad?

39:17.529 --> 39:22.490
He put that rifle
in your hand, didn't he?

39:24.100 --> 39:25.667
You wanted
to make him proud.

39:25.711 --> 39:28.278
Isn't that right?

39:28.322 --> 39:30.237
There's no need
to be embarrassed.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.371
That's all any son wants.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.199
I just wanted to be a man.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.986
- I guess.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.597
- But you were scared.

39:42.641 --> 39:47.428
A man who gets scared is hardly
a man, isn't that right?

39:47.472 --> 39:51.476
A man who gets scared,
a boy who gets scared,

39:51.519 --> 39:54.043
he's a fraud.

39:54.087 --> 39:58.352
He needs to be punished,
be humiliated.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.441
And that's why your father
raped you, right?

40:00.485 --> 40:02.530
- Objection.
- Overruled.

40:02.574 --> 40:05.794
- No, no, no!

40:05.838 --> 40:07.056
My father would never do--

40:07.100 --> 40:08.580
my father would never do that.

40:08.623 --> 40:10.451
He would never.

40:21.419 --> 40:24.247
- Has the jury
reached a verdict?

40:24.291 --> 40:26.902
- We have, Your Honor.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.731
- On the sole count

40:29.775 --> 40:32.604
of the indictment of rape
in the first degree,

40:32.647 --> 40:36.390
we find the defendant
not guilty.
