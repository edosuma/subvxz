00:07.441 --> 00:10.411
- MAN: Previously on
"Mayor of Kingstown".

00:11.745 --> 00:13.781
- Oh shit.
- [siren blaring]

00:13.781 --> 00:16.150
- GUARD: We will fire on you.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.287
- They will kill him if they
get a chance and you know it.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.988
Let's move him
to the women's prison.

00:20.988 --> 00:22.923
- How are things
with Mr. Michael?

00:22.923 --> 00:24.358
- He won't take my calls.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.562
- Milo wants to try something
a little bit different.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.265
- He wants you to do something
and you won't do it.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.101
He's gonna do this to me again
if you don't.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.003
- No, he's not
gonna do this again.

00:37.571 --> 00:40.674
Your boss sets you up
with judges and congressmen.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.376
You got plenty to tell.

00:42.376 --> 00:44.712
- Busy girl.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.781
- MILO: I will skin her alive,
Mike.

00:47.781 --> 00:48.916
- If you can find her.

00:48.916 --> 00:51.619
- Hand the phone
back to Candace.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.587
Show him our little secret.

00:53.587 --> 00:55.256
- He put a locator in you?

00:55.256 --> 00:57.991
- MILO:
I already found her, Mike.

01:10.037 --> 01:16.009
- *

01:19.280 --> 01:21.815
- Hey, where's my
fucking pat down?

01:22.683 --> 01:26.019
Ooh, break me off
a fucking piece of that.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.791
- I need searching, daddy.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.427
- All right, ladies,
you're in classroom D13A,

01:33.427 --> 01:35.963
let's find our way.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.267
- I know my way, baby.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.602
- I'm sure you do.

01:50.043 --> 01:53.681
- What genius in administration
sent you here?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.949
- It's for my safety.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.152
I had an incident
at the men's prison.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.920
- You're no safer here.

01:59.920 --> 02:03.657
The female inmates are
just like the male inmates.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.827
They think the same
and they act the same.

02:06.827 --> 02:10.798
And they will use you
in exactly the same way.

02:10.798 --> 02:11.865
- I'm aware.

02:11.865 --> 02:14.001
- Stand in the back
of the classroom,

02:14.001 --> 02:18.005
and stop making
eye contact with them.

02:27.981 --> 02:33.887
- [prisoner chatter]

02:44.198 --> 02:48.135
- Eyes will be on me, or you
will be removed from the class.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.571
Understood?

02:52.039 --> 02:58.045
I think today, maybe we'll
talk about human evolution.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.448
Or the lack of it.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.350
To think about
the evolution of man,

03:02.350 --> 03:07.120
it's always a good idea to
remember that we're all animals.

03:07.120 --> 03:11.825
And the rules which govern
the lives of lions, of wolves,

03:11.825 --> 03:14.662
of our closest relatives,
the primates,

03:14.662 --> 03:18.766
are no different than the rules
which govern our lives.

03:18.766 --> 03:21.935
We are in constant competition
with each other,

03:21.935 --> 03:25.773
competition to breed, to eat,

03:25.773 --> 03:29.377
to seek water and shelter.

03:29.377 --> 03:33.914
Only man cannot survive
without a tribe.

03:33.914 --> 03:39.720
Empathy exists to ensure
the survival of our offspring.

03:39.720 --> 03:45.092
Morality,
whatever that may mean,

03:45.092 --> 03:49.630
exists to govern the behavior
of the members within the tribe

03:49.630 --> 03:53.133
in hopes that the tribe
does not destroy itself.

03:53.133 --> 03:57.137
But now, all these tribes
live close together,

03:57.137 --> 03:59.707
and we must find a way

03:59.707 --> 04:04.478
to see all humankind
as one species,

04:04.478 --> 04:07.448
not as a collection of tribes.

04:07.448 --> 04:11.452
Our survival depends upon this.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.755
The age of competition is ended.

04:14.755 --> 04:18.659
The age of cooperation is here.

04:18.659 --> 04:21.529
If we do not
find a way to cooperate,

04:21.529 --> 04:26.266
to extend that empathy
to all humankind,

04:26.266 --> 04:32.005
then we will be the axe
that chops our own roots.

04:32.005 --> 04:37.177
We will be the arbiters
of our own extinction.

04:40.414 --> 04:46.387
- *

05:46.246 --> 05:48.682
- [phone ringing]

05:48.682 --> 05:50.217
- There were three agents?

05:50.217 --> 05:51.652
- Three, yeah.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.221
- You get his name?

05:54.221 --> 05:58.659
- Uh, it was a Hask-- Haskins or
Hastings, somethin' like that.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.528
The guy looks like
a fucking weatherman.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.895
Heaven asshole.

06:01.895 --> 06:06.834
- Pete Hastings.
Special Agent out of Detroit.

06:06.834 --> 06:10.037
- So, what's to move forward?

06:10.037 --> 06:11.639
We approaching this
as a missing person

06:11.639 --> 06:13.340
or a person of interest?

06:13.340 --> 06:15.943
- Look, he's a senior agent.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.978
I can't come up with a scenario
where he's involved

06:17.978 --> 06:20.781
in the kidnapping of a witness
and the murder of fellow agents.

06:20.781 --> 06:23.050
- He's a missing
person of interest.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.885
How's that?

06:24.885 --> 06:27.688
- I can live with that.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.290
- So, where are you?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.159
- Pulling surveillance footage
from the park

06:32.159 --> 06:33.861
and on the street
around Mike's house.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.829
- No cameras in your office?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.297
- I have cameras on the roof,

06:37.297 --> 06:39.733
covering the front entrance
and back entrance.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.003
You guys have cameras
in streetlights.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.973
- We need your phone.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.942
- All right.
Yes, sir.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.846
- [line trilling]

06:52.846 --> 06:54.782
- REBECCA: Hey Mike.
- Hey, it's me.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.985
Uh, can you transfer my number
to a new cell?

06:57.985 --> 07:01.054
And PD's gonna need the security
footage from the computers.

07:01.054 --> 07:02.690
- REBECCA:
I'm going through it now.

07:02.690 --> 07:06.059
- Kay, I'll be back in a bit.

07:07.194 --> 07:10.531
- Murder of a fellow agent
comes to us and we want it.

07:10.531 --> 07:13.333
- It's in my jurisdiction.

07:13.333 --> 07:15.235
We share it.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.205
- We want lead.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.407
- It's yours.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.877
- Can I go?

07:23.877 --> 07:25.979
- He'll contact you.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.215
- Okay.
- Reach out the minute he does.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.350
- Ahh, will do.

07:30.350 --> 07:34.822
- [phone ringing]

07:36.557 --> 07:38.859
- Mike.
- Not now.

07:40.260 --> 07:43.063
- Mike.
- Not now, parking lot.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.937
- Mike.
- What the fuck, Kyle, what?

07:49.937 --> 07:51.772
- Is this about what we dug up?

07:51.772 --> 07:53.406
- Maybe.

07:53.406 --> 07:55.142
- Maybe you realize that if
this comes to the surface,

07:55.142 --> 07:56.777
we're all in a fucking cage.
- Dude, it's not

07:56.777 --> 07:59.446
coming to the surface.
I'm not gonna let it.

07:59.446 --> 08:01.549
- Yeah, well, whatever you do,
take a different fucking car,

08:01.549 --> 08:04.117
'cause they're tracking that
one.

08:05.953 --> 08:08.522
What do we do?

08:08.522 --> 08:10.157
- You don't do a fucking thing.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.726
Understand me?
I'll figure it out.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.895
Get the suits off my ass,
how's that?

08:14.895 --> 08:17.030
Can't do anything with a tail.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.434
- Fuck...

08:23.671 --> 08:28.175
- *

09:02.576 --> 09:05.445
- Fuck...

09:16.289 --> 09:17.925
Rebecca.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.328
Time to get a new office.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.298
- I can't tell you how happy
I am to hear you say that.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.067
- Find us one?

09:27.067 --> 09:31.271
- Okay.
- Also, I gotta trade you cars.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.914
Thank you.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.517
- Oh, Mike.

09:47.487 --> 09:49.657
- You're the best.

09:52.559 --> 09:55.629
- *

09:56.063 --> 10:00.067
- [line trilling]

10:00.067 --> 10:02.069
- WOMAN: Dawson Sellick.
- Paul Dawson.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.304
- WOMAN: Who's calling?
- His fucking conscience.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.008
- This is Paul.
- I need to see him.

10:08.008 --> 10:11.411
- Mike, look, I don't think--
- Look, today, Paul.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.346
And you there too.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.715
- PAUL: Why me?

10:14.715 --> 10:17.550
- Because if you're there,
then they can't record it.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.653
- PAUL: Mike, look,
I can't hear that conversation.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.354
- Well, you're gonna
fuckin' hear it, all right?

10:21.354 --> 10:23.290
Or you're gonna watch it
on the news.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.725
- PAUL: [sighs] All right, fine.
How about tomorrow?

10:24.725 --> 10:26.559
- How about in an hour?

10:26.559 --> 10:28.996
- PAUL: I'll call you back.
- [phone beeps]

10:50.283 --> 10:53.386
- Man, you even walking worried.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.755
- Hey.

10:57.357 --> 10:58.992
- What's with the grape, man?

10:58.992 --> 11:01.695
You fuckin' them strippers now?
- Naw.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.596
It's a long story.

11:03.596 --> 11:07.667
- Heh, your story's
all over the streets bruh.

11:07.667 --> 11:11.538
Shit, I hope you stocked up
on carpet cleaner.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.881
- You ever, uh,
do anything with Milo's crew?

11:20.881 --> 11:23.050
- Fuck no.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.753
Crips don't crime with crackers.

11:25.753 --> 11:29.256
And them Slavic motherfuckers
is just shit-house crazy.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.759
I don't need to tell you that.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.866
What you need?

11:38.866 --> 11:40.500
- I don't know yet.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.304
- Well, when you
figure that shit out,

11:44.304 --> 11:47.140
you know where to find me.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.278
- It's gonna take me a minute
to fix your problem.

11:51.278 --> 11:54.481
I gotta fix mine first.

11:56.616 --> 11:59.887
- That's the thing
with problems, Mike.

11:59.887 --> 12:03.356
You can leave them
as long as you want.

12:03.356 --> 12:07.227
They're still gonna be there
when you get back.

12:07.227 --> 12:11.298
Just gonna be big as shit.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.736
- *

12:20.373 --> 12:22.609
- Yeah.

12:26.613 --> 12:31.819
- *

12:39.692 --> 12:42.262
- Need the tie.

12:48.902 --> 12:50.770
These laces worry you?

12:51.939 --> 12:54.374
- Who's he seeing?

12:55.408 --> 12:59.712
Ah, inmate will be
restrained to his chair.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.681
The laces don't worry me.

13:03.650 --> 13:07.354
- Open the wallet for me,
fan any cash out on the counter.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.794
- [camera clicks]

13:14.794 --> 13:17.164
- Place it back.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.775
One lighter.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.378
One pack of smokes.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.812
Keys.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.281
Cell phone.

13:34.281 --> 13:38.085
One wallet, $1,807 cash.

13:38.085 --> 13:39.719
One tie.

13:39.719 --> 13:42.255
One black belt.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.461
Go to screening.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.434
- Got your slip?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.437
Interview five.
- [buzzer buzzes]

13:57.437 --> 13:59.772
- Walk in front of me.

14:03.843 --> 14:08.815
- *

14:22.262 --> 14:23.663
- Knock three times,
we'll reinstate video.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.299
Once we establish the room
is safe, we'll open the door.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.700
If there's an emergency,

14:27.700 --> 14:30.537
hit the red button on the wall
or knock twice.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.340
- All right.
- [door buzzes]

14:35.408 --> 14:39.312
- *

14:45.152 --> 14:48.355
- Looks like she was
your flavor after all.

14:48.355 --> 14:51.424
- Fucking Milo.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.428
You have been in this box
too God damn long.

14:55.428 --> 14:58.498
Have you lost all perspective?

14:58.498 --> 15:02.202
- In many ways,
you can see better from here.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.403
- I'm glad you like it,

15:03.403 --> 15:04.871
because it's all
you're gonna fucking see.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.839
Do you understand that?
That's until they link you

15:06.839 --> 15:09.576
to the double murder
in my fucking office!

15:09.576 --> 15:11.378
Then they're just gonna pump
your veins full of poison

15:11.378 --> 15:13.546
and be done with you, like I am.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.950
- But they won't link it to me,
Mike.

15:16.950 --> 15:21.354
They won't find the girl I sent,
they won't find the phone.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.756
And they won't find Iris.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.995
So, let's talk about my favor.
- No.

15:27.995 --> 15:30.730
Let's not.
No fucking favors.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.865
There're feds up my ass
because of you.

15:32.865 --> 15:35.435
I got two cars on my tail
everywhere I go.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.869
There's aerial surveillance.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.406
I'm sure they got a fucking
satellite tracking me,

15:39.406 --> 15:41.908
everywhere I go, anywhere,
they're gonna be there.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.010
Do you understand that?

15:43.010 --> 15:45.012
So, anything I find, Milo,

15:45.012 --> 15:46.713
they find, and they keep it.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.283
- This isn't a favor to me,
Mike.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.786
The favor is to you.
- Is that right?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.064
What am I moving?

16:04.064 --> 16:07.834
- You don't have to move it,
you just have to find it.

16:07.834 --> 16:12.439
The people following you
will know what to do next.

16:15.408 --> 16:18.311
It's in a case.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.181
The case is metal.

16:21.181 --> 16:24.517
Look for metal.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.722
- Okay, let's talk about, Iris.

16:29.722 --> 16:33.560
- Oh, that ship has sailed,
Mike.

16:33.560 --> 16:36.796
You had your chance,
and you turned it down.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.631
Iris had a job to do
and she didn't do it,

16:38.631 --> 16:41.968
now she has he old job back.

16:41.968 --> 16:44.404
Forget Iris.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.006
Iris is gone.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.975
But now I know.

16:48.975 --> 16:52.279
Next time I need you,
I just have to break an angel.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.946
- PAUL: Jesus, Milo,
I can't be hearing this.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.482
- Shut the fuck up.

16:55.482 --> 16:57.550
- MILO:
What I ask protects you.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.686
It helps me, yes,
but it protects you

16:59.686 --> 17:03.256
because if you find it,
you're the savior.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.859
If they find it,
God help you.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.867
- What about the 30 feds
up my ass right now?

17:14.867 --> 17:17.036
- Bring them with you.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.579
- [knocks three times]
- That's the spirit.

17:29.949 --> 17:32.152
- [door closes]

17:52.672 --> 17:55.108
- Get showered and get dressed.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.376
- Where are we going?

17:56.376 --> 17:59.112
- Back to work.

18:15.895 --> 18:18.798
Don't drink that.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.735
They're going to do blood work,
urine work...

18:22.735 --> 18:26.706
Where did he get
the whiskey in the trunk?

18:27.574 --> 18:29.876
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.051
- So, this clears us up?
We're good?

18:39.051 --> 18:42.121
- Yeah, we're good.

18:45.492 --> 18:48.027
- So, I get a tap
on the shoulder.

18:48.027 --> 18:49.762
I turn around and

18:49.762 --> 18:52.799
that's the last thing
I remember?

18:55.368 --> 18:58.271
All right.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.706
Let's get on with it.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.042
Make it look good,

19:03.042 --> 19:05.578
but I don't want
fucking brain damage.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.215
- We won't hurt your brain.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.126
- [breathing quickly]

19:20.126 --> 19:22.329
- Ready.

19:22.329 --> 19:24.664
- *

19:43.816 --> 19:48.521
- *

20:17.183 --> 20:18.518
- What is this?

20:18.518 --> 20:23.523
- A lesson.
No more senators for you.

20:23.523 --> 20:29.429
- *

20:57.624 --> 20:59.526
- What's this?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.861
- A gift.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.565
- Gifts usually come
with strings.

21:05.565 --> 21:08.568
- Not this one.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.074
- You call me
when you want her back.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.810
- She's yours to keep.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.251
- Wanna party?

21:29.522 --> 21:33.526
- *

21:38.531 --> 21:42.001
- [sniffs]

21:42.001 --> 21:43.503
I go first.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.540
- We all go first.

21:50.777 --> 21:56.182
- *

22:01.354 --> 22:03.356
- I heard things
at max are tense.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.358
- That place is
a fuckin' jungle.

22:05.358 --> 22:08.595
Honestly,
today felt like a vacation.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.297
- [snickers]
- I'm not saying it's easy, but-

22:11.297 --> 22:13.199
- You just wait until
we put 'em to bed in a minute

22:13.199 --> 22:14.534
and tell me it's easy.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.102
- Well, what happens
when we put 'em to bed?

22:16.102 --> 22:17.637
- Nothing, for us.

22:17.637 --> 22:19.338
They're gonna throw
the kitchen sink at you.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.973
- You're their age, you're fit,

22:20.973 --> 22:23.943
you look like all the guys they
got pinned up on their walls.

22:23.943 --> 22:25.512
- Most of all, you're new,

22:25.512 --> 22:26.679
so, they're gonna poke and probe

22:26.679 --> 22:28.381
and see where
they can get through.

22:28.381 --> 22:30.116
If they can get through.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.486
- They do the same shit
at the men's prison.

22:34.387 --> 22:36.088
- They're gonna cry,

22:36.088 --> 22:38.458
and they're gonna give you
every sob story.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.359
And then,
when you pass by their cell,

22:40.359 --> 22:41.794
they'll give you a peep show.

22:41.794 --> 22:43.663
Then you're gonna get a
phone call from your supervisor

22:43.663 --> 22:45.164
saying that they've been
getting complaints

22:45.164 --> 22:47.434
that you're watching the inmates
when they change their clothes.

22:47.434 --> 22:49.836
- And there's just enough
assholes in uniforms

22:49.836 --> 22:51.404
who are watching 'em change,

22:51.404 --> 22:53.673
and slipping girls
in the supply closet,

22:53.673 --> 22:56.843
to make those complaints
have teeth.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.711
- So, you're telling me,

22:58.711 --> 23:00.547
there's guys in uniform,

23:00.547 --> 23:02.982
having relationships
with inmates.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.852
- It's not just guys.
- Assholes come in every gender.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.253
- Wow.

23:07.253 --> 23:09.556
- The two most
coveted jobs for inmates,

23:09.556 --> 23:12.992
the library,
and walking the track.

23:12.992 --> 23:15.294
- Walking the track?
- There's an exercise track

23:15.294 --> 23:17.897
outside the wall.
They walk it looking for trash.

23:17.897 --> 23:21.568
It's in the sunshine, there's
trees and flowers and fresh air.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.570
And they get to walk and gossip

23:23.570 --> 23:26.372
and forget they're in prison
for seven hours a day.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.675
- When you go past it,
you tell me how many ugly girls

23:28.675 --> 23:30.843
you see walkin' the track.
- And those are the same girls

23:30.843 --> 23:33.345
with $1000 in their accounts
at commissary.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.215
- Riddle me that shit.
- [group laughs]

23:36.215 --> 23:39.886
- This prison's dangerous
in a different way.

23:40.920 --> 23:44.190
- Hey.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.925
Just do this,
and you'll be fine.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.494
Be a fucking robot.

23:47.494 --> 23:50.863
A by the book,
emotionless robot, okay?

23:54.867 --> 23:56.836
- I could do that.

23:59.706 --> 24:02.341
- Close A-24.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.013
- Close A-23.

24:12.852 --> 24:15.021
- Close A-22.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.460
- Close A-21.

24:24.163 --> 24:27.166
- Nope.
Lemme see it.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.436
- See what?
- Stand and face the wall.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.945
- Close A-20.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.481
- What a waste of money.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.350
These don't even work down here.

24:44.350 --> 24:47.720
- Can I at least
delete the pictures?

24:47.720 --> 24:50.289
Come on man, I don't need
y'all looking at that.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.058
- You know the rules.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.160
Close A-19.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.428
Robot, take 17.

25:03.402 --> 25:05.705
- [knocks]

25:05.705 --> 25:06.739
- You good?

25:09.308 --> 25:11.544
- Am now.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.381
- FEMALE GUARD: Close A-18.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.688
- Close A-17.

25:30.096 --> 25:33.633
- [gravel crunching]

25:57.223 --> 25:59.025
- Brought ya some dinner.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.827
Not that I've ever seen you eat.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.429
- I eat.
- Yeah, I don't doubt it.

26:03.429 --> 26:07.133
I just never seen it.
- Yeah.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.268
Got somethin' better.
- Thanks.

26:09.268 --> 26:13.773
- [can opens]
- Mm...

26:20.179 --> 26:23.582
So, you wanna run me through it?

26:23.582 --> 26:26.218
- He wants us to go back out
on the property

26:26.218 --> 26:29.021
and find a metal case.

26:29.455 --> 26:31.924
- Mike...

26:32.859 --> 26:34.894
You can't go back out there,
you got,

26:34.894 --> 26:37.664
you got two fucking feds
sittin' down your dirt road.

26:37.664 --> 26:40.032
- He wants us
to bring them with us.

26:40.032 --> 26:43.803
- It's a fuckin' set-up Mike.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.073
I just can't figure out how.

26:47.073 --> 26:49.408
If I tell the FBI I got a tip

26:49.408 --> 26:51.811
on the death of one
of their agents, right?

26:51.811 --> 26:55.514
We could go dig up the fucking
world and find who knows what.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.283
I don't see how it
blows back on us.

26:57.283 --> 26:58.985
- It fuckin' does.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.554
I promise.

27:10.496 --> 27:12.598
What about the girl?

27:12.598 --> 27:15.001
- There's no girl.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.737
She's gone, she's...

27:17.737 --> 27:21.407
back at work, under his thumb.

27:21.407 --> 27:22.942
Who knows where.

27:24.744 --> 27:28.080
I could flip stones for
a lifetime and never find her.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.549
Neither could you.

27:32.418 --> 27:36.522
- I feel like all we do
is tread water.

27:36.522 --> 27:41.027
In the middle of the lake,
no shore in sight.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.495
- Yeah.

27:45.732 --> 27:49.068
'Cause that is all we do.

27:56.275 --> 27:59.045
- Tracy's pregnant.

27:59.045 --> 28:02.048
- Yeah, I know.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.350
Boy or girl?

28:04.350 --> 28:06.719
- We don't know yet.

28:08.320 --> 28:11.190
- Do you care?

28:11.190 --> 28:14.493
- Not really.

28:15.161 --> 28:18.731
I mean, I feel like
I'm supposed to say boy but...

28:19.465 --> 28:21.934
you know, then what?

28:22.634 --> 28:26.806
Grows up in this hell?
Every day a fucking fight?

28:27.974 --> 28:31.610
- It'd be the same hell
for your daughter too, brother.

28:35.748 --> 28:38.985
- *

28:40.686 --> 28:43.389
- Y'know, I just
keep thinkin' Florida.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.291
Or somewhere.

28:45.291 --> 28:47.193
A little beach town.

28:47.193 --> 28:51.764
Bustin' spring breakers
for open containers.

28:54.700 --> 28:58.838
- Gotta save the world from
entitled teenagers, right?

29:01.607 --> 29:04.944
- What have we ever saved, Mike?

29:04.944 --> 29:07.780
Hmm?

29:07.780 --> 29:10.983
Not a fucking thing.

29:17.356 --> 29:20.292
- You should probably
stop hanging out with me, kid.

29:22.328 --> 29:26.298
- Yeah, that's what Mom says.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.137
- Mom's right.

29:36.142 --> 29:39.111
- *

29:40.546 --> 29:42.949
- [buzzer buzzes]

29:50.056 --> 29:56.062
- *

30:11.410 --> 30:13.745
- James Parker, you have been
convicted of three counts

30:13.745 --> 30:17.149
of murder in the first degree
by a jury of your peers,

30:17.149 --> 30:20.486
and sentenced to death
by lethal injection.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.455
Do you have any last words?

30:23.455 --> 30:26.592
- They weren't my peers.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.929
- Do you have any last words?

30:30.696 --> 30:33.699
- No words for you.

30:37.736 --> 30:40.239
But for you...

30:41.673 --> 30:45.411
I wonder what you'll do
when you realize

30:45.411 --> 30:48.847
it was all your fault.

30:48.847 --> 30:52.151
- That's confession enough
for me.

30:52.151 --> 30:54.153
I'm gonna watch you die,
you son of a bitch.

30:54.153 --> 30:57.689
- Another outburst, and you'll
be removed from the gallery.

30:58.724 --> 31:03.095
- Enjoy it.
I did.

31:08.400 --> 31:12.939
- [motor whirs]

31:21.948 --> 31:28.454
- *

32:00.886 --> 32:04.023

33:31.443 --> 33:35.747
- [breathes deeply]

33:47.959 --> 33:51.730
- [gunshots]

34:06.044 --> 34:09.448
- You want some breakfast?

34:12.118 --> 34:14.686
Sit down.

34:16.021 --> 34:18.624
You're not hungry?

34:22.394 --> 34:26.165
Nope, be none of that shit.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.541
- I don't smoke.
- You sure?

34:35.541 --> 34:38.610
It'll make you feel better.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.958
- [coughs]
- [laughs]

34:52.958 --> 34:57.496
That's good, coughin'
gets it in there, real good.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.572
Well, if you ain't gonna eat,

35:07.439 --> 35:10.642
let's go take a shower.

35:25.457 --> 35:29.895
- *

35:36.502 --> 35:42.073
- [prisoner chatter]

35:46.612 --> 35:49.215
- I'll see you tonight.

35:49.215 --> 35:52.251
What the fuck?
- Hey!

35:52.251 --> 35:54.520
Eyes forward and walk, ladies.

35:55.887 --> 35:58.990
- Get your head out of your ass.

36:05.030 --> 36:08.200
- Breakfast.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.750
- *

36:29.755 --> 36:32.324
- Code 20, B block.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.860
- RADIO: Which cell?

36:38.297 --> 36:39.665
- All of them.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.801
- [alarm buzzing]

36:42.801 --> 36:46.137
- PA: Officer assistance needed
Cell Block 2.

36:46.137 --> 36:51.743
- [alarm buzzing]

37:13.299 --> 37:14.833
- WARDEN: They're clearly
making a statement.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.802
- It's not a fucking statement.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.571
They do that, sir, hoping that
one of us will step up

37:19.571 --> 37:23.375
and just push them off, so they
can turn around and shank us.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.943
It's a threat.
- It's a mind game.

37:24.943 --> 37:28.347
- All due respect, sir,
you are misreading the room.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.816
- Kareem?
- I've seen it before.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.218
I've never seen a whole block
do it, but I've seen it.

37:33.218 --> 37:35.887
- So, what's the endgame here?
We keep the lockdown,

37:35.887 --> 37:38.557
they escalate on their end.
Before you know it,

37:38.557 --> 37:39.791
there's a prison-wide
hunger strike

37:39.791 --> 37:41.360
during the fuckin' holidays.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.863
- We can't blink, sir.
We have to turn up the heat.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.166
- How much hotter can it get?
- Lights on, 24-7.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.336
And we do not give them an
option to hunger strike.

37:50.336 --> 37:51.870
We just stop bringing breakfast.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.272
- Ed, this isn't Guantanamo Bay.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.241
Look, I need to reach out to the
Bureau of Prisons

37:56.241 --> 37:58.209
to get some more
guidance on this, okay?

37:58.209 --> 38:01.880
- Sir, those politicians, they
have no place in this fight.

38:01.880 --> 38:05.451
- Sir, they will tell us
to sit with inmate leadership

38:05.451 --> 38:07.085
and negotiate.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.521
- It legitimizes a point of view
that is not

38:09.521 --> 38:11.022
a legitimate point of view.

38:11.022 --> 38:12.691
- Why is their point of view
not legitimate?

38:12.691 --> 38:15.126
- Because they're
fucking convicts!

38:15.126 --> 38:19.030
- Ed, get the fuck
off of my desk.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.868
Bring the leaders.

38:22.868 --> 38:27.606
Just the leaders of each group
to the cafeteria.

38:27.606 --> 38:30.208
We will hear them out.

38:30.208 --> 38:36.047
- *

38:41.119 --> 38:44.189
- Open A-top-9.
- [buzzer buzzes]

38:53.365 --> 38:58.837
- *

39:01.607 --> 39:07.713
- [prisoners shouting]

39:15.153 --> 39:16.321
- [buzzer buzzes]

39:40.846 --> 39:43.749
- Get dressed, let's go.

39:46.117 --> 39:51.222
- *

40:26.625 --> 40:28.794
- You speak outta school,

40:28.794 --> 40:30.762
you die in the shower.

40:30.762 --> 40:34.633
Swear to fucking God.
Out.

40:34.633 --> 40:39.270
- *

40:54.686 --> 40:55.887
- *

40:55.887 --> 40:58.123
- [buzzer buzzes]

41:19.578 --> 41:22.013
- Can I trust you gentlemen to
put your differences aside

41:22.013 --> 41:25.751
and sit at the same table?

41:29.888 --> 41:32.658
- You're the only difference we
worried about at the moment.

41:32.658 --> 41:34.660
- I'm gonna keep you cuffed.

41:34.660 --> 41:36.562
But I will let you sit.

41:36.562 --> 41:39.330
- Take me back to my hole.
I ain't sittin' here negotiatin'

41:39.330 --> 41:40.866
with my fuckin' hands
behind my back.

41:40.866 --> 41:45.436
- This isn't a negotiation.
This is a discussion.

41:46.204 --> 41:49.407
Gentlemen,
you know how this works.

41:49.407 --> 41:51.376
When things boil over
in the yard,

41:51.376 --> 41:53.712
we'd lock it down
until cooler heads prevailed.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.647
- They wanted it to boil over.

41:55.647 --> 41:57.482
They put me and my captains
in the hole,

41:57.482 --> 42:00.018
and turned the yard out
the same time.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.153
Why not stagger the yard
when you know there's a vacuum,

42:02.153 --> 42:06.524
like you did every other time
since I been here?

42:06.524 --> 42:10.662
Naw, this is what they wanted.

42:12.798 --> 42:16.301
- Why would they want it?
- You know why.

42:16.301 --> 42:21.106
Overtime, double time.

42:21.106 --> 42:24.275
Hazard pay.

42:24.275 --> 42:26.544
You're just fucking banks
to these guards.

42:26.544 --> 42:28.213
- There's been quite the
power shift on the yard,

42:28.213 --> 42:30.916
you expect me to believe you're
not gonna try and take it back?

42:30.916 --> 42:33.752
How I'ma do that, when these
three working together?

42:33.752 --> 42:36.021
But that marriage
gonna end soon.

42:36.021 --> 42:39.825
And we'll see what we see.

42:39.825 --> 42:42.861
But they ain't the gangs
I'm worried about at the moment.

42:42.861 --> 42:47.165
- Which gang worries you?
- Your gang.

42:48.133 --> 42:52.103
See, there's rules to banging.
We all know 'em.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.872
Lock these three up next week,

42:53.872 --> 42:57.475
try to do the same thing to 'em.

42:57.475 --> 42:59.645
It's just business.

42:59.645 --> 43:03.281
But I know this,
if we shake on it,

43:03.281 --> 43:05.717
that's what it is.

43:05.717 --> 43:07.619
Shake hands wit chu...

43:07.619 --> 43:09.921
nobody knows what it is.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.223
But it ain't what they promise.

43:12.223 --> 43:13.959
- And what did they promise?

43:13.959 --> 43:15.961
- Treat us like men.

43:15.961 --> 43:17.663
Give us some more time
in the yard so we ain't

43:17.663 --> 43:19.530
all bunched up on each other.

43:19.530 --> 43:23.234
Give us some decent fuckin' food
in the commissary.

43:23.234 --> 43:27.906
- May I ask what this promise
was in exchange for?

43:33.378 --> 43:36.381
- For takin' out
your fuckin' trash.

43:36.381 --> 43:39.584
- Our trash?
- Your trash.

43:39.584 --> 43:43.154
Your child-murdering,
motherfuckin' trash.

43:59.871 --> 44:02.107
- Do I have your word
there will be no retribution

44:02.107 --> 44:03.942
against the other groups?

44:05.643 --> 44:08.914
- Not forever.

44:08.914 --> 44:11.649
I'll give you
until I get my window.

44:11.649 --> 44:15.286
Let these fools
play handball for now.

44:15.286 --> 44:18.389
I'm tired of it.

44:18.389 --> 44:22.093
- I need peace in the valley.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.770
Break your word to me,

44:31.770 --> 44:33.471
and all of you
will be in different prisons

44:33.471 --> 44:36.908
by the end of the day.

44:41.012 --> 44:43.181
- Let's go.

44:43.181 --> 44:45.817
- Wasn't gonna say nothin'
'til you told me not to.

44:45.817 --> 44:47.753
Now, you gotta eat shit
for dinner.

44:47.753 --> 44:49.254
- You're a fucking dead man.

44:49.254 --> 44:51.122
- Well, you better
kill me quick motherfucker,

44:51.122 --> 44:54.059
before I shove a shank
through your fuckin' skull.

44:55.460 --> 44:59.064
- Why in the hell is he talkin'
about trash and child killers?

44:59.064 --> 45:02.033
- I don't know,
but I'll find out.

45:14.212 --> 45:17.382
- [prisoner chatter]

45:18.716 --> 45:20.618
- [buzzer buzzes]

45:21.552 --> 45:22.620
- [buzzer buzzes]

45:23.221 --> 45:25.190
- [buzzer buzzes]

45:28.426 --> 45:32.630
- [prisoners cheering]

45:55.220 --> 45:57.755
- What the fuck was that?

46:13.571 --> 46:19.144
- *

46:25.483 --> 46:28.286
- Ugh, man...

46:32.157 --> 46:36.127
- Do we take the trash
as evidence, or the whole truck?

46:36.127 --> 46:38.563
- I'm not diggin' through
all that shit, fuck that noise.

46:38.563 --> 46:41.332
Take the whole truck.

46:46.838 --> 46:49.574
Yeah [chuckles]

46:49.574 --> 46:51.709
Thank you, gentlemen.

46:52.510 --> 46:54.345
Mike.

46:57.582 --> 46:59.117
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:59.117 --> 47:00.618
- The FBI?
- They're on their way,

47:00.618 --> 47:02.753
but I wanna know now.

47:07.392 --> 47:09.127
Jesus...

47:09.694 --> 47:11.829
- Fuck...

47:11.829 --> 47:13.764
Yeah, that's him.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.401
- So he wasn't in on it, huh?

47:16.401 --> 47:18.569
- I don't know.

47:18.569 --> 47:21.272
Why...
Why take him?

47:21.272 --> 47:23.474
Why pick him up? Kill him?
Then you have to dump him.

47:23.474 --> 47:25.911
Why not just shoot him where
he was, like the other two?

47:25.911 --> 47:28.746
- Yeah.
- No, he's in on it.

47:28.746 --> 47:31.049
He didn't know Milo
like I know him.

47:33.218 --> 47:36.154
Look it,
I'm gonna head out that way.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.823
- Alone? No feds?

47:38.823 --> 47:40.926
- No feds yet.

47:40.926 --> 47:43.328
I'm just gonna poke around,
see if there's any bear traps,

47:43.328 --> 47:44.896
know what I mean?

47:44.896 --> 47:47.999
- Yeah, what if you step in one
and nobody's around ya?

47:47.999 --> 47:49.467
- I'll be all right.

47:49.467 --> 47:51.937
- Hey, hold on.

47:51.937 --> 47:53.838
No service out there.
- Oh yeah.

47:53.838 --> 47:55.173
- Find something,
we'll come running.

47:55.173 --> 47:56.741
- Okay.

47:56.741 --> 47:59.277
- Mike.
- Yeah?

47:59.277 --> 48:02.513
- You won't be alone,
FBI's all over you.

48:02.513 --> 48:06.551
- [sirens wailing]

48:06.551 --> 48:08.853

50:57.388 --> 51:00.258

You hear me?
It's over between us.

51:03.994 --> 51:08.099
Hey, that's not for you.

the Whites, and the Mafia,
have a 30 minute pow-wow.

56:00.057 --> 56:02.560
Know what it means when rival
gangs group together?

56:04.261 --> 56:06.864
It means,
they're talkin' about us.

56:06.864 --> 56:08.566
- Explain to me
how you found this.

56:08.566 --> 56:10.901
- Milo said metal case.

56:10.901 --> 56:12.437

you look like right now?

56:12.437 --> 56:13.504
Like a big patsy.

56:15.205 --> 56:16.841
