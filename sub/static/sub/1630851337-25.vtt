IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US

00:38.234 --> 00:41.371
BEFORE WE GET THINGS KICKED OFF,
WE WANTED TO TAKE A SECOND TO

00:41.371 --> 00:43.940
SAY ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE
"VOICE" FAMILY, OUR HEARTS ARE

00:43.940 --> 00:47.310
GOING OUT TO EVERYBODY AFFECTED
BY THE STORMS AND TORNADOS THAT

00:47.310 --> 00:50.246
HAVE ABSOLUTELY DEVASTATED SO
MANY PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

00:50.246 --> 00:52.248
ESPECIALLY KENTUCKY THIS PAST
WEEKEND.

00:52.248 --> 00:57.453
SO BEFORE WE HAVE FUN HERE
TONIGHT, WE JUST WANTED TO TELL

00:57.453 --> 00:59.255
ALL OF YOU THAT YOU ARE IN OUR
THOUGHTS AND OUR PRAYERS TONIGHT.

00:59.255 --> 00:59.956

THEY'RE GOING TO DO A BALLAD
THEY'RE GOING TO DEDICATE THAT

01:10.333 --> 01:14.771
BALLAD TO SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING
SPECIAL IN THEIR LIVES

01:14.771 --> 01:19.375

01:29.685 --> 01:32.522
LET'S KICK OFF OUR BIG FINALE
WITH THE YOUNG NEW JERSEY POP

01:32.522 --> 01:35.525
SINGER WHO WENT FROM A REGULAR
KID TO POSSIBLY WINNING IT ALL

01:35.525 --> 01:38.895
FOR TEAM KELLY
HERE'S MORE ABOUT THE METEORIC

01:38.895 --> 01:41.230
RISE OF HAILEY MIA

01:41.230 --> 01:43.666
HAILEY MIA, YOU ARE A
FINALIST ON "THE VOICE."

01:43.666 --> 01:45.435
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE

01:45.435 --> 01:51.374
IT FEELS AMAZING.
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE

01:51.374 --> 01:54.477
THIS THIS FAR.

01:54.477 --> 01:56.345
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BLIND
AUDITION

01:56.345 --> 02:00.016
WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE WHEN THE
CHAIR TURNED AROUND?

02:01.651 --> 02:07.657
I SING WITH MY EYES CLOSED.
SO WHEN I OPENED MY EYES AND YOU

02:07.657 --> 02:10.927
AND ARIANA BOTH TURNED AROUND, I
WAS LIKE WHAT?

02:10.927 --> 02:12.261
I'M 13 YEARS OLD.

02:12.261 --> 02:13.229
HOLY MOLY.

02:13.229 --> 02:15.365
ARIANA.

02:15.365 --> 02:19.235
I TOTALLY THOUGHT YOU WOULD
MAKE THE FINALE.

02:19.235 --> 02:20.770
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD BE ABLE
TO BE STOLEN

02:20.770 --> 02:24.440
THIS IS WHERE IT
STARTS LIKE IT WAS MEANT TO BE

02:24.440 --> 02:26.776
FROM THE BEGINNING BECAUSE WHEN
YOU DO THE BALLAD ROUND, YOU

02:26.776 --> 02:28.811
LOST THAT BATTLE.

02:28.811 --> 02:31.614
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT LIFE WAS
AT THAT VERY MOMENT.

02:31.614 --> 02:36.219
I DID NOT PLAN ON USING MY
STEAL HERE, BUT YOU CAME OUT,

02:36.219 --> 02:37.253
AND I WAS LIKE, WHAT

02:37.253 --> 02:40.289
YOU GET ON THE SHOW
YOU'RE ON ONE TEAM

02:40.289 --> 02:43.192
NOW YOU'RE ON KELLY'S TEAM
YOU WIN IN THE KNOCKOUTS

02:43.192 --> 02:44.293
NOW YOU'RE GETTING YOUR FEET A
LITTLE BIT.

02:44.293 --> 02:46.763
YEAH.

02:46.763 --> 02:49.298
WHEN YOU DID OLIVIA
RODRIGO IN THE PLAYOFFS, THAT

02:49.298 --> 02:53.503
WAS A GREAT MOMENT

02:54.637 --> 02:56.305
IT'S INTERESTING.
PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND SONG

02:56.305 --> 03:01.377
SELECTION.
IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOUR TALENT

03:01.377 --> 03:03.813
JUST TURNED 14
I'VE BEEN 14 AND SINGING AND NO

03:03.813 --> 03:06.482
ONE SOUNDS LIKE THAT
SOME PEOPLE DON'T GET IT WHEN

03:06.482 --> 03:09.652
YOU COME IN THIS ARENA AND YOU
COME AS A FIGHTER, YOU REALLY

03:09.652 --> 03:12.522
FIGHT YOUR WAY AND CLAW YOUR WAY
TO KEEP YOUR SPOT.

03:12.522 --> 03:13.823
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
ARTISTS.

03:13.823 --> 03:16.492
ESPECIALLY BEING IN THE WILD
CARD, I WAS SO EMOTIONAL, AND

03:16.492 --> 03:20.530
THAT PUSHED ME TO WORK EVEN
HARDER AND GIVE AN EVEN BETTER

03:20.530 --> 03:22.365
PERFORMANCE THAN I WOULD HAVE
NORMALLY.

03:22.365 --> 03:25.301
ELASTIC HEART WAS ONE
OF MY FAVORITE PERFORMANCES YOU

03:25.301 --> 03:25.735
DID ALL SEASON LONG.

03:25.735 --> 03:28.771
SO GOOD

03:30.807 --> 03:31.874
I LOVE THAT SONG.

03:31.874 --> 03:34.811
AND SO YOUNGEST
ARTIST IN THE COMPETITION.

03:34.811 --> 03:37.814
I'VE SAID IT A MILLION TIMES
BECAUSE IT'S SO REMARKABLE

03:37.814 --> 03:40.583
LIKE YOU CAN WIN IT ALL, AND WHY
SHOULDN'T YOU WIN IT ALL

03:40.583 --> 03:45.421
IT'S THERE FOR THE TAKING.
WHAT ARE YOU SINGING

03:45.421 --> 03:51.527
DEJA VU BY OLIVIA RODRIGO.

03:51.527 --> 03:53.663
I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT IT ♪

03:53.663 --> 03:57.867
THE COOL THING ABOUT DEJA VU
FOR THE FINALE IS IT SHOWS ALL

03:57.867 --> 04:01.571
OF HER VOCAL CAPABILITIES, HER
SOFTNESS, HER TENDERNESS, HER

04:01.571 --> 04:04.841
SASSINESS, HER ANGER
WE'VE NEVER HEARD HER SING LIKE

04:04.841 --> 04:05.608
THIS ON THE SHOW

04:05.608 --> 04:07.910
WHOO!
OH, MY GOD, I LOVE IT.

04:07.910 --> 04:12.281
THE ONLY THING I'M GOING TO SAY
BECAUSE THIS IS THE FINALE, I

04:12.281 --> 04:14.717
THINK WE SHOULD BUILD A BIT
SOONER

04:14.717 --> 04:17.653
KELLY HAS TAUGHT ME SO MUCH
LIKE SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW HOW

04:17.653 --> 04:20.623
MUCH SHE'S TAUGHT ME
SHE'S SO INVESTED IN ME, AND

04:20.623 --> 04:23.826
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M GOOD
ENOUGH TO STILL BE HERE.

04:23.826 --> 04:24.727
IT'S AMAZING, AND I'M JUST SO
GRATEFUL.

04:24.727 --> 04:26.696
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S GOING TO BE SO GOOD.

04:26.696 --> 04:27.830
I CAN'T WAIT.

04:27.830 --> 04:29.832
SHE'S SO YOUNG.
SHE ALREADY KNOWS HER VOICE

04:29.832 --> 04:33.369
REALLY WELL.
SHE CAN KIND OF GO SOULFUL WITH

04:33.369 --> 04:39.776
IT OR POP ROCK WITH IT
IF I'M A RECORD LABEL, I AM VERY

04:39.776 --> 04:42.478
EXCITED ABOUT HAILEY MIA
AMERICA, LIKE, PREPARE TO BE

04:42.478 --> 04:43.780

HAILEY MIA, I'M SO PROUD OF
YOU. THAT WAS SO FUN.

I LOVE WHEN YOU SING THESE BIG
BALLADS AND YOU GET TO SHOW OFF

08:18.928 --> 08:22.265
IN THAT WAY.
BUT THIS WAS JUST SO INCREDIBLE.

08:22.265 --> 08:27.737
THE ENERGY WAS SO APPROPRIATE.
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A GREAT

08:27.737 --> 08:31.340
DIRECTION FOR YOU AS AN ARTIST
YOUR FLIPS INTO FALSETTO WERE MY

08:31.340 --> 08:33.509

INSPIRED HIM FROM THE BEGINNING.
HERE'S MORE FROM

10:35.277 --> 10:37.045
PARIS WINNINGHAM

10:37.045 --> 10:41.183
TO MY FATHER, YOU OPENED MY
EYES TO BE A TRUE LOVER OF MUSIC.

10:41.183 --> 10:45.587
I REMEMBER ONE DAY AFTER CHURCH,
YOU BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION THAT

10:45.587 --> 10:48.156
WHEN I GET IN FRONT OF PEOPLE TO
SING, I WOULD ROCK BACK AND

10:48.156 --> 10:54.062
FORTH.
YOU TOLD ME, SON, THE NEXT TIME

10:54.062 --> 10:56.731
YOU FEEL LIKE ROCKING, JUST TAKE
A STEP

10:56.731 --> 11:02.103
I REMEMBER LOOKING BACK AT YOU
LIKE YOU WERE CRAZY.

11:02.103 --> 11:05.173
BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS

11:05.173 --> 11:11.513
THAT FIRST STEP THAT LED ME TO

11:11.513 --> 11:17.118
THE STAGE I'M ON TODAY
NOW THAT I'VE GROWN INTO A MAN,

11:17.118 --> 11:20.055
I TRULY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING
THAT YOU SAID.

11:20.055 --> 11:25.660
I COULD TALK ABOUT SO MANY
MUSICAL ICONS.

11:25.660 --> 11:34.169
BUT, DAD, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THE

11:34.169 --> 11:38.306
NUMBER ONE INSPIRATION TO MY
MUSIC AND THE REASON WHY I AM

11:38.306 --> 11:43.044

AND DREAMS IN MUSIC HER ENTIRE
LIFE

25:27.054 --> 25:28.789
HERE'S MORE FROM JERSHIKA MAPLE.

25:28.789 --> 25:31.592
I WANT TO WRITE THIS LETTER
TO MY CHURCH COMMUNITY

25:31.592 --> 25:34.628
WITHOUT YOUR PRAYERS AND
SUPPORT, I DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD

25:34.628 --> 25:38.765
HAVE MADE IT THIS FAR.
I AM WHO I AM TODAY BECAUSE OF

25:38.765 --> 25:41.735
MY CHURCH COMMUNITY.
THEY SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT I

25:41.735 --> 25:45.772
COULD NOT SEE.
THE VERY MOMENT I SAID YES TO

25:45.772 --> 25:50.644
BEING A WORSHIP LEADER WAS WHEN
MY LIFE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER

25:50.644 --> 25:56.650
THE FIRST COUPLE OF YEARS WAS
VERY ROCKY FOR ME.

25:56.650 --> 25:59.319
I WAS YOUNG, SHY, AND VERY
NERVOUS.

25:59.319 --> 26:02.656
BUT I KNEW I WASN'T ALONE.
TILL THIS DAY, MY CHURCH

26:02.656 --> 26:05.993
COMMUNITY STILL JOKES ABOUT ME
LITERALLY GOING FROM HIDING

26:05.993 --> 26:10.764
BEHIND THE PODIUM BECAUSE I WAS
SO SHY TO THEM SEEING THE GROWTH

26:10.764 --> 26:16.036
OF HOW I COMMAND THE STAGE AND
POUR MY HEART OUT EVERY SUNDAY

26:16.036 --> 26:18.839
SO EVENTUALLY I STARTED TO
EMBRACE MY GIFT.

26:18.839 --> 26:23.911
AFTER SIX YEARS KNOWING THAT I
HAD TO LEAVE MY CHURCH BEHIND TO

26:23.911 --> 26:27.447
PURSUE MY DREAMS OF COMING TO
"THE VOICE," IT WAS HONESTLY THE

26:27.447 --> 26:32.019
HARDEST DECISION EVER.
THE FIRST PERSON I TOLD WAS MY

26:32.019 --> 26:36.723
PASTOR TO SEE THE JOY AND EXCITEMENT IN

26:36.723 --> 26:41.762
HIS EYES AND TO KNOW THAT HE
APPROVED OF ME LEAVING TO PURSUE

26:41.762 --> 26:44.898
MY DREAMS WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
FEELING IN THE WORLD

26:44.898 --> 26:47.901
HE SAID TO ME, YOU'RE GOING TO
WIN BEFORE I LEFT.

26:47.901 --> 26:50.304
SO TO MY CHURCH COMMUNITY, THANK
YOU FOR RELEASING ME WITH GRACE

26:50.304 --> 26:55.642
