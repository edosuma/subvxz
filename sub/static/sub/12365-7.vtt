00:11.220 --> 00:13.336
[teakettle whistling]

00:23.399 --> 00:25.481
[Walt] Hey, do you know
where my new shirt is?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.604
The blue one.
lcan't seem to find it.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.276
[woman]
Well, how hard are you looking?

00:30.573 --> 00:32.063
[Walt] I'm looking
where the shirts are.

00:32.283 --> 00:33.318
[woman] Well, obviously
you're not looking

00:33.534 --> 00:35.240
where all the shirts are.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.290
[sighs]

00:58.309 --> 01:00.345
I'm so sorry.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.052
[woman] You were supposed to
do the dishes last night.

01:06.651 --> 01:08.858
I think I know how to make it up
to you.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.486
I doubt that's possible.

01:24.001 --> 01:26.413
[breathing heavily]

02:02.039 --> 02:04.451
[sighs]
Huh.

02:07.336 --> 02:08.837
[sighs]

02:22.602 --> 02:25.184
[country music playing]

02:30.109 --> 02:33.442
[Travis] M So I drink
my Tennessee whiskey J‘J‘

02:33.654 --> 02:34.734
Oh, man.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.063
And -- [sighs]

02:37.283 --> 02:40.650
J‘J‘ And I sip my Texas beer J‘J‘

02:40.870 --> 02:44.362
J‘J‘ Smoke my cigarette all -- J‘J‘

02:44.582 --> 02:46.038
[rustling]

02:54.216 --> 02:56.343
Holy shit.

03:01.349 --> 03:02.805
Help me.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.682
Help me.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.362
[telephone ringing]

03:29.919 --> 03:31.705
Sheriff's Department.

03:31.879 --> 03:34.040
[Travis] Yeah, uh, hey, we have
an incident in progress

03:34.256 --> 03:37.339
on county 52, mile marker 13.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.757
Who is this?

03:38.969 --> 03:40.470
[Travis]
Sheriff, is -- is that you?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.841
Uh, it's Travis Murphy.

03:43.057 --> 03:44.843
You got to get out here.

03:45.810 --> 03:47.596
Something bad happened.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.491
Hey.

04:11.711 --> 04:13.076
What the hell's going on,
Travis?

04:13.295 --> 04:14.910
[sighs]

04:15.131 --> 04:17.372
You know, you -- you hear people
talk about highway robbery,

04:17.591 --> 04:20.298
and H never really thought
about where that term came from.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.047
It's just...

04:22.263 --> 04:25.596
Well, it's this, just getting
robbed on the highway.

04:25.808 --> 04:27.719
How much you had to drink?

04:27.935 --> 04:30.221
[Travis] I'm not really sure
how that's relevant right now.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.429
I'm just being a Good Samaritan.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.642
There's a...

04:35.818 --> 04:37.809
There's a dead guy over there.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.608
You said on the phone
he was injured.

04:41.824 --> 04:44.156
It's a different guy.
The injured guy's in my car.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.534
Look, l-l didn't know

04:47.747 --> 04:50.989
that there was a dead guy
when I called you.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.000
He's been shot.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.828
In the head.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.959
[Walt] Just tell me
what you know, Travis.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.384
One second.
Um...

05:08.601 --> 05:12.014
Okay, uh, Peter Hoyt
and Jerry Napek were, uh,

05:12.229 --> 05:14.060
driving back from the casino
around 12:22

05:14.273 --> 05:15.809
when their car
got run off the road.

05:16.025 --> 05:18.607
Two guys got out of the vehicle
with, uh, guns.

05:18.819 --> 05:23.358
Uh, Jerry says that, um --
that they were just after money

05:23.574 --> 05:27.988
and that, uh, Peter started
acting like he was tough and...

05:29.914 --> 05:31.620
...they shot him.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.448
And this is Peter Hoyt?

05:34.668 --> 05:36.283
I think so.
l-l mean, it must be.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.369
l-l didn't check for ID.
or anything.

05:38.589 --> 05:40.545
I didn't want to mess up
the crime scene.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.965
That's Jerry Napek in your car
back there?

05:43.177 --> 05:44.508
Yeah.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.336
He's, uh -- He's still
pretty freaked out.

05:47.556 --> 05:49.467
Uh, he says that they threatened
to shoot him, too,

05:49.683 --> 05:51.548
but he wound up just giving them
all of his money,

05:51.769 --> 05:54.636
and they took his crutches
and just left him here.

05:54.855 --> 05:55.810
His crutches?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.560
Yeah.
He's a cripple.

06:00.486 --> 06:01.771
ls -- Is that offensive?

06:01.987 --> 06:03.693
-Yep.
-Sorry.

06:03.906 --> 06:07.194
Um, here, you can keep these.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.493
Is this a grocery list?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.616
Shit. Yeah.
Forgot about that.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.575
Uh, but the rest of that stuff,
it might come in handy.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.622
Thanks.

06:21.423 --> 06:23.163
Man.

06:23.384 --> 06:24.840
This is heavy.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.634
-[thunder rumbles]
-Yeah, it is.

06:32.768 --> 06:34.679
[Jerry] They knocked
on the window with a gun,

06:34.895 --> 06:39.639
and, uh, they yelled at Peter
to give them all his money.

06:39.859 --> 06:41.941
But he just won pretty big
at the casino,

06:42.152 --> 06:44.063
and so he didn't want
to give it up.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.441
And then they pulled him
out of the car.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.111
-[sobs]
-|t's all right, Mr. Napek.

06:54.874 --> 06:57.331
Mr. Napek, l, uh,

06:57.543 --> 07:00.580
found some Pringles
and some water if you're hungry.

07:01.505 --> 07:02.665
[Walt]
Here.

07:04.383 --> 07:08.171
You think you could, uh,
describe the men who did this?

07:08.387 --> 07:11.049
H was just so scared.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.348
l was just trying
to keep my head down.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.846
I thought they were
gonna kill me, too.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.643
Why do you think they didn't?

07:20.065 --> 07:21.646
I think when they saw
my condition,

07:21.859 --> 07:23.895
they didn't think of me
as much of a threat.

07:24.111 --> 07:27.194
They just took my crutches and
my phone and they left me here.

07:27.406 --> 07:30.569
I had to crawl for help.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.908
ldidn't --
I didn't know where l was

07:34.121 --> 07:37.454
or if I was even going
in the right direction.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.584
I tried to save Peter.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.295
I tried.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.624
But I couldn't save him.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.610
[Mathias]
Well, well, well.

08:17.039 --> 08:18.449
What brings you
to Hector's wall?

08:18.666 --> 08:20.247
Hello, Mathias.

08:20.459 --> 08:21.960
[Mathias] I've been wondering
who's been resurrecting

08:22.169 --> 08:23.284
the myth of Hector,

08:23.796 --> 08:25.912
and I suppose it makes sense
it would be the guy

08:26.131 --> 08:28.747
who was basically responsible
for his death.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.799
I do not know what you
are talking about.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.171
[Mathias]
Bullshit.

08:32.554 --> 08:34.806
I know someone's been picking up
Hector's notes.

08:36.016 --> 08:37.847
It looks like you are.

08:39.937 --> 08:41.518
[Mathias]
It's been about the only way

08:41.730 --> 08:44.312
for me to find out what's
happening on the Res anymore.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.935
So, is filling Hector's shoes

08:49.154 --> 08:51.645
your way of atoning
for your sins?

08:51.865 --> 08:54.732
lam not here to pick up
Hector's notes.

08:54.952 --> 08:56.658
lam here to leave one for him.

08:59.581 --> 09:00.957
This is private.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.124
Between you and a ghost?
Unh-unh.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.452
As soon as someone
started answering these

09:06.672 --> 09:08.708
and breaking the law to do it,

09:08.924 --> 09:10.425
this became my business.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.420
You're assuming lam asking
Hector to break the law.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.172
No, I'm assuming
you're bullshitting me

09:14.388 --> 09:16.219
and that really isn't
a letter to Hector.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.848
You don't strike me as one
of those superstitious Indians

09:20.060 --> 09:21.391
who believes in spirits.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.265
But you do seem
self-righteous enough

09:24.481 --> 09:26.642
to think that you could
take Hector's place.

09:26.859 --> 09:29.521
You do not honestly believe I am
trying to be the new Hector.

09:29.737 --> 09:33.571
The longer you refuse to show me
that letter, the more I do.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.795
This new Hector copycat

09:54.011 --> 09:56.423
is making my job
even more difficult.

09:57.181 --> 09:58.762
It's been hard enough
to rebuild trust

09:58.932 --> 10:01.389
after the way Malachi
ran this department.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.435
Now the people trust
this vigilante more than me.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.432
I'm gonna shut him down.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.812
But if he can take care of this
first?

10:11.028 --> 10:12.564
More power to him.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.084
Whoa.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.794
Made it in before the new guy.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.789
Zachary's in Cheyenne.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.245
What for?

10:32.007 --> 10:34.168
Uh, training seminar?

10:35.761 --> 10:36.546
Vic.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.127
Yeah?

10:38.347 --> 10:40.633
-I need you to take a statement.
-0kay. Whose?

10:41.683 --> 10:42.718
Mine.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.759
What'd he do this time?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.810
Saved a man's life.

10:48.023 --> 10:50.810
Travis was the first witness
at the scene of a robbery.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.607
One man's dead,
and his friend's at the hospital

10:52.820 --> 10:54.401
being checked out.

10:54.613 --> 10:57.821
Ferg, victim's name
was Peter Hoyt.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.569
Here's his license-plate number.

10:59.785 --> 11:02.322
Find out what you can --
address, employer, next of kin.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.903
I'd do it myself,

11:04.123 --> 11:05.613
but I told the survivor
I'd give him a ride home

11:05.833 --> 11:06.788
after he's done at the ER.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.831
Got it.

11:10.879 --> 11:15.122
So, uh, do you need me
to swear in or anything?

11:19.096 --> 11:20.836
He all right?

11:21.056 --> 11:24.389
[Walt] He's got a few scrapes,
maybe a little dehydrated.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.432
Doctors got some fluids in him.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.385
This guy's been through
a lot worse than that.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.221
Yeah. Even so,
he was pretty shaken up.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.726
They,uh,
gave him some sedatives.

11:32.943 --> 11:34.524
[Jerry] Ah!

11:34.736 --> 11:36.067
[groaning]

12:03.765 --> 12:06.177
[Henry]
I feel like I have lost a step.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.634
| read that boxing
is an all-around great workout,

12:08.854 --> 12:11.596
but I lack the discipline
to train on my own.

12:11.815 --> 12:12.975
[Jack] You're in luck.

12:13.192 --> 12:15.433
I'm running
a midlife-crisis special.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.153
For 100 bucks a month,

12:17.362 --> 12:20.479
I'll turn you into the best
over-40 boxer on the Res,

12:20.699 --> 12:22.655
present company excepted.

12:23.869 --> 12:25.234
I'll find you some gloves.

12:25.454 --> 12:26.819
Here. Tape up.

12:30.042 --> 12:34.411
So, Jack, maybe you can help me
settle a bet.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.246
My friend and l were watching
a Burt Reynolds movie.

12:37.966 --> 12:42.084
Burt popped a guy in the mouth
and knocked out a tooth.

12:42.304 --> 12:43.760
My friend said
that could not happen.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.678
l disagreed.
Who is right?

12:45.891 --> 12:49.179
Depends on how bad the teeth are
and how good the punch.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.352
Is there any particular
technique,

12:52.564 --> 12:54.850
any part of the mouth
that is especially vulnerable?

12:55.067 --> 12:57.604
After you warm up,
I'll show you.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.400
[Walt]
Henry.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.654
What are you doing here?

13:02.866 --> 13:04.197
Looking for you.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.242
Hey, Sheriff, do me a favor.
Warm him up.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.661
I've got some things
to take care of in my office.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.744
[chuckles]

13:12.960 --> 13:15.872
Yeah. That sounds like the
Peter Hoyt I'm talking about.

13:16.088 --> 13:17.828
Sure.
I'll hold.

13:18.048 --> 13:19.163
I still can't get over it.

13:19.383 --> 13:21.169
You know, the guy,
he can't walk,

13:21.385 --> 13:23.501
and he dragged himself almost
three miles just to get help.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.630
I mean, most people
would have quit.

13:24.846 --> 13:26.382
Okay, focus, Travis.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.180
Right.
Uh, sorry.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.509
Is that Peter Hoyt's blood
on you?

13:32.854 --> 13:35.015
Wow. Um...

13:35.983 --> 13:38.349
Yeah, l-l guess, uh --

13:38.568 --> 13:39.944
I guess that's from when
the sheriff and l

13:40.153 --> 13:42.940
were moving his body
over to the Bronco.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.899
It could also be Jerry's because
l-l carried him over to my car.

13:47.119 --> 13:49.986
He was pretty bloody, too.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.660
You ever get used to it?

13:55.127 --> 13:57.118
Dead bodies and all that?

13:59.381 --> 14:02.088
After a few years, sure.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.541
Don't listen to him, Travis.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.467
If death stops getting to you,
you should quit.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.388
[sighs]

14:18.317 --> 14:19.773
So, what is the latest

14:19.985 --> 14:21.566
with the case against those men
who raped Gab?

14:21.778 --> 14:23.359
There is no case.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.735
Victim won't file charges
or talk, so nothing I can do.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.239
Not to mention I got a mugging
and a murder last night,

14:31.455 --> 14:32.740
someone leaving that casino,
so...

14:32.956 --> 14:34.116
Is that why you are here?

14:36.126 --> 14:37.582
No.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.536
Actually, I had
a very strange dream last night.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.041
Felt like it meant something.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.336
[grunts]
lam not much of a Freudian.

14:46.762 --> 14:51.256
Well, I was looking for a more
traditional interpretation.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.682
Didn't your grandmother
do a lot of that stuff?

14:54.770 --> 14:56.010
What kind of dream was it?

14:58.482 --> 15:00.143
I was looking for a shirt.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.147
Were there any spirit animals
in your dream?

15:05.364 --> 15:06.570
An owl? A wolf?

15:08.492 --> 15:10.653
-Nope.
-One of your ancestors?

15:12.662 --> 15:13.868
Nope.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.446
Well, then I cannot help you.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.041
Maybe you should see
a psychiatrist.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.286
What happened to your nose?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.376
Started bleeding.

15:25.592 --> 15:28.709
So, what'd we find out
about our shooting victim?

15:28.929 --> 15:31.045
Well, turns out the deceased,
Peter Hoyt,

15:31.264 --> 15:33.676
was just released from prison
a couple weeks ago.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.893
[Walt]
So, what was he in for?

15:38.105 --> 15:41.097
[Ferg] Assault in Sheridan
eight years ago.

15:41.316 --> 15:43.181
Served eight years?

15:44.361 --> 15:45.771
That's just two years shy
of the max.

15:45.946 --> 15:47.527
Must have been serious.

15:47.739 --> 15:49.525
Find any next of kin?

15:50.200 --> 15:52.532
His parents live in Ranchwood.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.121
The car's actually registered
to them.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.082
Well, someone
needs to notify them.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.076
I should probably
head to Sheridan,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.548
see if I can find any details
about that assault

16:05.757 --> 16:06.997
might shine a light on this.

16:07.217 --> 16:11.051
Um, I could go
and see his parents.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.476
Why don't you take the Charger?

16:20.939 --> 16:23.681
It's no good doing
a notification in a Trans Am.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.115
[door closes]

16:31.324 --> 16:33.940
[indistinct conversations,
telephone ringing]

16:39.666 --> 16:41.622
Excuse me.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.292
-ls Dr. Monaghan available?
-Do you have an appointment?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.960
-No.
-Then no.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.504
You need to call
and make an appointment.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.630
Unless it's an emergency.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.422
Is it an emergency?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.180
[Walt] Don't worry.
It's not bad. Um...

17:05.442 --> 17:06.773
I was in Sheridan on business,

17:06.985 --> 17:11.274
and, um, ljust dropped by
to apologize.

17:11.990 --> 17:13.070
Oh.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.027
For what?

17:15.243 --> 17:17.495
Accusing me of drug trafficking?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.779
I guess that about sums it up,
yeah.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.955
Okay, well, let's hear it, then.

17:24.878 --> 17:25.913
What?

17:27.297 --> 17:30.004
Your apology for accusing me
of drug trafficking.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.879
Didn't I just do that?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.969
Is it hard for you
to admit you're wrong?

17:38.767 --> 17:40.928
Isn't it hard for everybody?

17:44.397 --> 17:46.604
So [clears throat]

17:46.816 --> 17:50.104
I'm sorry that l accused you
of drug trafficking.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.776
It's just, you know,

17:51.988 --> 17:54.024
there were stolen drugs
at your church meeting,

17:54.241 --> 17:56.197
same drugs that I saw here,

17:56.409 --> 18:00.027
and, uh, well,
you can see how that looked.

18:00.830 --> 18:04.789
So, you're sorry but not really.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.958
I'm sorry.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.250
Completely.

18:09.422 --> 18:10.753
You didn't deserve that,

18:10.966 --> 18:13.127
especially given
all the good you do.

18:16.179 --> 18:18.340
Okay.
Thank you, Sheriff.

18:22.852 --> 18:25.229
[sighs]

18:30.110 --> 18:32.692
Do you want an apology receipt
or something?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.715
[alarm chirps]

18:59.389 --> 19:01.345
[knock on door]

19:03.351 --> 19:04.181
Mr. Hoyt?

19:04.394 --> 19:05.725
Yeah? What do you want?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.723
I need to talk to you
about your son, Peter.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.645
Can you guys just leave him
alone, all right?

19:09.858 --> 19:10.768
He's done his time.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.440
It's -- It's not it, sir.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.768
He's not here.
He went to visit his friend.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.524
I don't know when he'll be back.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.604
Sir.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.404
Peter's not coming back.

19:23.288 --> 19:27.372
Your son and his friend
were robbed last night,

19:27.584 --> 19:29.575
and during the course
of the robbery,

19:29.794 --> 19:33.207
your son, Peter, he was shot.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.788
[Thomas]
Oh, God.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.126
What about Jerry?
ls Jerry okay?

19:40.472 --> 19:42.963
Uh, Jerry's alive.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.469
[sighs]
Thank God.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.641
Thank God.

19:49.064 --> 19:53.228
So, l-l guess --
I guess you know Jerry?

19:53.443 --> 19:54.353
[Thomas]
Oh, I do.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.940
Jerry was our family's friend.

19:58.156 --> 20:00.943
Maybe the best we've ever had.
You're sure he's okay?

20:02.035 --> 20:05.072
l-l gather that he's
a little shaken up.

20:05.288 --> 20:08.246
But, yeah, he's -- he's okay.

20:10.251 --> 20:16.087
Uh, sir, I, uh --
I know that this is a shock.

20:16.299 --> 20:19.917
Um, but I need you
to understand.

20:20.136 --> 20:24.300
Your son, Peter, he's dead.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.548
[Thomas]
Yeah, I know.

20:26.768 --> 20:28.383
[liquid pouring]

20:28.603 --> 20:32.937
l was just -- You sound more
concerned about his friend.

20:34.401 --> 20:38.360
It's terrible to say, but, um...

20:39.864 --> 20:41.195
I think you're right.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.532
Pete was in prison.
He became a stranger.

20:44.744 --> 20:48.202
Jerry was here... with us.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.871
He lifted up our spirits.

20:50.083 --> 20:54.042
He moved heaven and earth
to get Pete out of prison.

20:54.254 --> 20:57.291
That was
just a couple weeks ago?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.418
His fourth parole hearing.

21:01.094 --> 21:04.586
And, uh, l-l don't think
Pete would have survived

21:04.806 --> 21:06.592
if they'd made him
serve his full sentence,

21:06.808 --> 21:10.300
so thanks to Jerry,

21:10.520 --> 21:14.809
he got to enjoy a little bit
of freedom before...

21:15.024 --> 21:16.764
before he died.

21:24.743 --> 21:28.577
[Schones] Peter Hoyt,
aggravated assault, 2007.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.120
He entered a sporting-goods
store with a .45

21:31.291 --> 21:33.407
and told the manager
to hand over all the cash.

21:33.626 --> 21:37.539
Got about 750 bucks, then he
shot the manager in the gut.

21:37.756 --> 21:41.294
Then Hoyt shot him again...
in the back.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.545
-So a thief and a coward.
-Yep.

21:43.762 --> 21:44.922
And the only thing that kept him

21:45.138 --> 21:46.719
from being
a cold-blooded murderer

21:46.931 --> 21:49.013
is that the clerk
somehow survived.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.095
-Accomplices?
-Uh...

21:52.312 --> 21:53.267
Nope.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.970
He was just one of those guys

21:55.190 --> 21:56.600
who gets a gun and feels like
he ought to use it.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.852
Anything unusual
about the victim?

21:59.068 --> 22:02.151
Besides the fact
that he survived two bullets?

22:02.363 --> 22:03.352
No.

22:03.573 --> 22:07.532
Working stiff, married, no kids.

22:09.662 --> 22:10.913
What's his name?

22:11.122 --> 22:13.829
Um... Jerry Napek.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.848
[knock on door]

22:33.061 --> 22:35.677
Hey. Can I come in?

22:37.023 --> 22:38.138
l was just about to leave.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.223
I can't do this anymore.

22:40.944 --> 22:42.275
Do what?

22:42.487 --> 22:44.068
Waiting tables.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.987
Waiting for the next
six-figure job to just show up,

22:47.200 --> 22:50.158
Waiting for my life
to suddenly kick into gear.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.533
I need to do something
with my life.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.742
How can I help?

22:57.418 --> 22:58.919
Okay.

22:59.128 --> 23:02.461
There's basically two
legal practices in Durant.

23:02.674 --> 23:04.756
One of them doesn't need me,
and the other one hates me,

23:04.968 --> 23:06.833
so I was thinking about the Res.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.384
What about the Res?

23:08.638 --> 23:11.129
l-l think I could do
really good work there.

23:11.349 --> 23:13.590
I mean, I could help people
like Gab.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.471
And I was hoping
that you would introduce me

23:15.687 --> 23:17.803
to whoever provides
legal services to the Res.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.605
Henry, I don't care
about the money.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.353
I'll volunteer my time.

23:22.569 --> 23:28.235
But at least then I'd be
doing something... important.

23:32.537 --> 23:34.152
Do not waste your time.

23:34.372 --> 23:37.034
The people do not trust lawyers
from the outside.

23:37.250 --> 23:39.741
And anytime a well-intentioned
activist shows up,

23:39.961 --> 23:41.371
it usually takes
less than six months

23:41.588 --> 23:43.419
for them to learn
there is nothing they can do.

23:45.466 --> 23:48.378
-Henry, I'm willing to try.
-That is your choice.

23:48.595 --> 23:53.089
But you and l have both seen how
the legal system serves the Res.

23:53.308 --> 23:54.844
And I cannot in good conscience

23:55.059 --> 23:56.640
encourage you
to throw your life away

23:56.853 --> 23:58.684
tilting at that
particular windmill.

24:00.106 --> 24:01.346
[scoffs]

24:12.994 --> 24:15.201
[indistinct conversations]

24:18.666 --> 24:20.531
[Jerry]
Oh, hey, Sheriff.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.708
Welcome to the Taj Mahal.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.536
How are you, Jerry?

24:24.756 --> 24:26.917
Well, I can't feel my legs.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.007
Come on back.

24:34.057 --> 24:37.174
So, I understand your friendship
with Peter Hoyt

24:37.393 --> 24:38.644
was a little complicated.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.844
Oh. That.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.228
Yeah. That.

24:43.441 --> 24:44.977
So, you want to know

24:45.193 --> 24:48.811
howl could be friends
with a man who shot me twice,

24:49.030 --> 24:51.146
permanently destroyed
my digestive system,

24:51.366 --> 24:53.482
and took away the use
of my legs.

24:53.701 --> 24:55.077
I do.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.901
I had no choice.

24:57.664 --> 24:58.904
I know that sounds crazy,

24:59.123 --> 25:02.411
but you got to understand

25:02.627 --> 25:05.209
I know what it's like
to live the other way.

25:05.421 --> 25:09.585
During Pete's trial and about
three years after that,

25:09.801 --> 25:14.215
l was so consumed
with hate for him,

25:14.430 --> 25:17.012
I didn't have room
for anything else in my life.

25:17.225 --> 25:20.558
I lost my wife.
I lost my job.

25:20.770 --> 25:24.809
You know what it's like when
the only thing you can think of

25:25.024 --> 25:27.686
from the second you wake up
in the morning

25:27.902 --> 25:32.692
until you medicate yourself
to sleep at night is hate?

25:34.575 --> 25:35.610
I can imagine.

25:35.827 --> 25:36.987
I don't think you can.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.068
It's hell.

25:39.956 --> 25:43.494
I would have killed myself
if I hadn't met Father Donahue.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.291
He taught me about forgiveness.

25:45.628 --> 25:50.088
He just made me understand that
as long as I hated Pete Hoyt,

25:50.299 --> 25:52.585
he had control of my life

25:52.802 --> 25:56.010
and that forgiving him
wasn't weakness.

25:56.973 --> 26:00.010
It was a gift
I was giving to myself.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.218
And when I stopped
spending all my time hating him,

26:03.438 --> 26:06.020
I had time to focus
on some other things,

26:06.232 --> 26:10.976
like getting out of this chair,
like living.

26:15.241 --> 26:18.779
So you advocated for his release
at his parole hearing?

26:18.995 --> 26:20.075
ldid.

26:20.413 --> 26:24.201
He made a mistake,
and he paid for it.

26:24.417 --> 26:26.157
Keeping him in prison
wasn't doing anything

26:26.377 --> 26:28.288
but keeping me from moving on.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.001
Forgiveness can set everybody
free, Sheriff.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.127
Well, it takes a big man
to think that way.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.213
Well, it doesn't happen
overnight.

26:40.433 --> 26:45.177
But when it does, it opens up
a whole world of possibilities.

26:45.396 --> 26:48.934
I just wish that Pete had, um --

26:49.150 --> 26:52.233
had more time
to experience that.

26:53.237 --> 26:56.354
Well, I'm sure he was grateful
for the time you got him.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.532
You think?

27:00.745 --> 27:02.110
I do.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.541
Sheriff, can I ask you a favor?
And you can say no.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.209
Go ahead.

27:11.422 --> 27:14.539
I see people put these memorials
out by the side of the road,

27:14.759 --> 27:18.547
and, uh, I made this for Pete.

27:18.763 --> 27:21.630
And I was wondering if maybe
you had some time this week

27:21.849 --> 27:26.559
that maybe you could drive me
out to where it happened

27:26.771 --> 27:30.389
and I could, uh --
I could put this up for him.

27:33.194 --> 27:34.024
I can do that.

27:35.738 --> 27:39.401
You call Ruby at the station.
We'll set it up.

27:43.746 --> 27:44.986
What the hell do you want?

27:45.206 --> 27:46.412
Well, I was gonna offer my help,

27:46.624 --> 27:48.285
but not
if you're gonna yell at me.

27:48.501 --> 27:49.286
Wait.

27:51.212 --> 27:52.702
Sorry.

27:52.922 --> 27:53.672
What?

27:53.881 --> 27:56.088
The boss in?

27:57.885 --> 27:59.921
This is not
an isolated incident.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.003
I've had three
in the last two weeks.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.963
How do you know they're related?

28:04.183 --> 28:07.095
I don't, but it seems like
it's worth checking out.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.518
Three people win big
at the casino,

28:09.730 --> 28:12.642
then as they're driving off,
they get pulled over and robbed.

28:12.859 --> 28:15.225
-Anybody die?
-[Mathias] No.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.060
All the victims describe
the attacks the same way?

28:18.281 --> 28:20.363
Only one victim
has come forward.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.657
So, how do you know
that there are three crimes?

28:22.869 --> 28:24.200
Well, that's a long story.

28:24.412 --> 28:25.618
It's also not an answer.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.411
Afraid it'll have to be.

28:27.623 --> 28:31.992
Look, I'm trying
to help you guys out.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.124
We close your case,
I close three of mine.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.876
Except you only have one.

28:42.096 --> 28:44.678
Sue Smart, last Thursday night.

28:44.891 --> 28:49.225
Terry Thurlow, the Saturday
before that at 2:00 am.

28:49.437 --> 28:53.225
And Joe Lone Elk, not sure
what day, but before dawn.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.646
So, why do you need my help?

29:04.118 --> 29:05.949
Because I'm having
a harder and harder time

29:06.162 --> 29:08.699
getting people to take me
seriously on the Res.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.405
And you have a murder.

29:10.625 --> 29:12.832
People pay attention
to a murder.

29:16.214 --> 29:19.832
Our surviving victim
was pretty traumatized.

29:20.051 --> 29:22.463
Maybe these folks
remember some more details.

29:33.898 --> 29:36.310
Maybe you and I
ought to do this together.

29:48.246 --> 29:49.827
Lone Elk.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.282
I want to talk to you
about what happened

29:54.502 --> 29:56.868
when you were leaving the casino
a while back.

29:57.088 --> 29:58.669
Yeah? What happened?

29:58.881 --> 30:01.463
You went to the casino,
and you won a few hundred bucks,

30:01.676 --> 30:03.041
and you got mugged.

30:03.261 --> 30:06.298
Well, the Lord giveth,
Lord taketh away.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.004
Wasn't the Lord, though,

30:08.224 --> 30:10.215
who ran you off the road
and robbed you at gunpoint.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.175
How you know about that?

30:13.396 --> 30:15.057
[Walt] Why don't you tell us
what happened?

30:15.273 --> 30:16.683
Why?
You seem to know it all.

30:17.400 --> 30:20.142
Not yet.
How many of them were there?

30:22.363 --> 30:23.443
Two.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.567
-Can you describe them?
-Nope.

30:25.783 --> 30:27.899
You didn't see them, or you
don't want to describe them?

30:28.119 --> 30:30.531
Look, it happened.
It's done.

30:31.914 --> 30:32.994
Way | see it,
l was being punished

30:33.207 --> 30:34.447
for trying to take a shortcut.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.373
What kind of shortcut?

30:36.585 --> 30:38.246
Took out a loan at the casino.

30:38.462 --> 30:41.249
Instead of working to try
to pay it back, I played craps.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.797
What do you mean, you took
a loan out at the casino?

30:44.010 --> 30:45.500
Exactly that.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.631
It's easier than the bank.
There's no paperwork.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.462
How big a loan?

30:49.682 --> 30:50.922
$500.

30:51.142 --> 30:53.679
Won it all back that night, too.

30:54.645 --> 30:56.306
I should have paid off that loan
right away.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.683
I should have known
it was too good to be true.

31:00.443 --> 31:02.775
I'm not supposed to be gambling.
I'm in a program.

31:02.987 --> 31:03.942
l was meant to work
for that money,

31:04.155 --> 31:05.736
which is what I'm doing now.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.655
Hear you get $3 or $4 a pound
for good copper.

31:15.249 --> 31:17.706
[rock music playing]

31:17.918 --> 31:19.294
ReaHy?

31:19.503 --> 31:21.004
That's interesting.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.335
Okay, I will, um --

31:25.551 --> 31:27.257
I will ask Ms. Smart about that

31:27.470 --> 31:28.926
when I finally get a chance
to talk to her.

31:29.138 --> 31:31.345
-Okay. Bye.
-Wait. Come on. Please?

31:31.557 --> 31:32.888
Sit down.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.761
Hey, I could use the company.

31:34.977 --> 31:37.138
I'm still a little freaked out
about what happened earlier.

31:37.355 --> 31:38.686
I've never seen a dead guy
before.

31:40.441 --> 31:42.102
Please?

31:47.156 --> 31:50.193
So, what's going on
with my case?

31:50.409 --> 31:52.650
I mean, have we found the guy
who killed Peter Hoyt yet?

31:52.870 --> 31:56.579
Uh, no, we didn't
catch anybody yet.

31:56.791 --> 31:58.247
Well, what do you think, then?

31:58.459 --> 32:00.120
I mean, do you think
that it was just a random thing,

32:00.336 --> 32:01.200
or did he actually know the guy?

32:01.420 --> 32:03.126
We don't know shit, Travis.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.125
Only that it's probably not
an isolated incident

32:05.341 --> 32:06.501
and that it most likely
has something to do

32:06.717 --> 32:08.332
with the casino
and loan-sharking.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.668
Wait.
Loan-sharking?

32:10.888 --> 32:13.220
You're saying there's
loan sharks here in Absaroka?

32:13.432 --> 32:15.388
I guess. Walt just interviewed
one of the victims,

32:15.601 --> 32:17.387
and he said he took a loan out
at the casino.

32:19.397 --> 32:22.184
Look, I am really tired,

32:22.400 --> 32:24.686
and l have to interview
a witness at the crack of dawn,

32:27.154 --> 32:29.770
You know what? I should probably
go, too. I'll walk you out.

32:29.990 --> 32:33.153
Please... don't.

32:44.588 --> 32:46.169
Shit.

32:46.382 --> 32:47.622
[Ferg whistles]

32:47.842 --> 32:49.252
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

32:49.468 --> 32:50.674
-How are you?
-Good.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.672
-You want some coffee?
-Yes, please.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.923
[Ferg whistles]

33:04.900 --> 33:08.518
So, Sue Smart took out a loan
at the casino, too.

33:08.737 --> 33:09.817
She say who she dealt with?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.236
[knock on door]

33:12.658 --> 33:14.899
Well, maybe Ferg
will have more luck. Okay.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.359
Thanks, Vic.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.990
You're here early.

33:19.915 --> 33:22.622
Yep.
I guess I am.

33:22.835 --> 33:24.371
There's a lot going on.

33:24.587 --> 33:27.420
Murder and serial muggings,
so...

33:27.631 --> 33:29.337
[Ruby]
Don't lie to me, Walter.

33:29.550 --> 33:31.290
I know you slept here
last night.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.341
And the night before that.

33:33.554 --> 33:35.135
Well, I never said I didn't.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.134
And I know everything
that's going on in this office.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.011
I know that.
[clears throat]

33:40.227 --> 33:43.435
So, I know you were using
my computer last night.

33:44.565 --> 33:46.396
Well, actually,
it's the department's computer.

33:46.609 --> 33:48.941
And you were Googling
a Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan.

33:49.153 --> 33:50.313
I was just doing
some follow-up --

33:50.529 --> 33:52.440
No, you were doing
an image search.

33:53.866 --> 33:57.654
Walter Longmire, what do you
think Martha would say

33:57.870 --> 34:00.282
if she could look down
and see you right now?

34:02.583 --> 34:05.074
She'd say, "I'm bored."

34:05.294 --> 34:07.410
Sleeping in a jail cell,
brooding,

34:07.630 --> 34:09.416
never cracking a smile.

34:09.632 --> 34:13.420
-I smile.
-If you like her, ask her out.

34:18.474 --> 34:19.884
I won't tell anyone.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.437
-[door closes]
'[Travis] Good morning!

34:35.658 --> 34:37.114
What do you want, Travis?

34:37.326 --> 34:39.362
Uh, I need to have a little
confab with the sheriff.

34:39.578 --> 34:40.954
Here I am.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.664
Hey, can we have a little bit
of privacy?

34:42.873 --> 34:44.784
[Walt]
Nope. What is it?

34:45.000 --> 34:47.833
Well, thought
you might like to know

34:48.045 --> 34:49.876
that you now have someone
on the inside.

34:50.089 --> 34:51.044
Inside of what?

34:51.257 --> 34:52.872
The casino.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.707
Well, I heard that you thought
that the Peter Hoyt murder

34:54.927 --> 34:56.633
might have something
to do with Ioan-sharking,

34:56.845 --> 35:00.133
so I, uh -- I went down to the
casino and I took out a loan.

35:01.976 --> 35:03.557
Who told you
that the Peter Hoyt murder

35:03.769 --> 35:05.760
had anything to do
with loan-sharking?

35:05.980 --> 35:08.392
I don't know that that's really
all that important right now.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.644
I may have, uh, inadvertently
mentioned something.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.235
Okay, Serpico.
Tell me about your loan.

35:19.451 --> 35:23.535
All right, so, I let it slip
at the craps table

35:23.747 --> 35:25.078
that I was could really
use a loan.

35:25.291 --> 35:26.872
Around 3:00 a.m.,
this dude approaches me

35:27.084 --> 35:28.665
and tells me he can put me
in contact with somebody.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.833
Tells me to go to
the second-floor men's room,

35:31.046 --> 35:32.832
uh, third stall from the left,

35:33.048 --> 35:35.164
and that my contact
would occupy the second stall.

35:35.384 --> 35:37.875
You took out a loan
in the men's restroom?

35:38.596 --> 35:42.339
Yeah. $1,200 at, uh,
20% due next week.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.015
-20% in a week?
-I know.

35:45.227 --> 35:47.138
Can you believe that people
actually fall for that crap?

35:47.354 --> 35:49.561
-Well, you did.
-[Travis] No, I didn't.

35:49.773 --> 35:51.229
I'm working as an informant.

35:51.442 --> 35:53.228
Could you ID.
the man that gave you the loan?

35:53.444 --> 35:55.856
Well, um, see, our transaction
was stall to stall,

35:56.071 --> 35:57.607
so I didn't see his face
in the bathroom.

36:00.826 --> 36:02.066
Not at that moment, but --

36:02.286 --> 36:04.197
So, the information
that you dug up

36:04.413 --> 36:06.529
is that you can get a bad loan?

36:06.749 --> 36:09.365
Look, I said I didn't see
his face in the bathroom,

36:09.585 --> 36:11.450
but I saw his boots.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.956
They were ostrich, blue.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.709
I mean, they made a statement.

36:15.924 --> 36:18.131
And I recognized them from
earlier at the craps table.

36:18.344 --> 36:19.629
They belong
to this big Indian dude,

36:19.845 --> 36:22.837
guy named, uh, Darren or --
orJuHus.

36:23.057 --> 36:25.548
-Was it Darius?
-Yes. Darius.

36:25.768 --> 36:26.928
Scary-looking dude.

36:27.311 --> 36:30.223
So, um, how do I go about
getting reimbursed?

36:30.439 --> 36:32.555
Do I talk to Ruby or what?

36:32.775 --> 36:35.562
Why don't you just return
the money that you borrowed?

36:35.778 --> 36:40.568
Look, I had to sell my cover,
so I, uh -- I spent it.

36:40.783 --> 36:43.274
What the hell
did you spend $1,200 on?

36:43.494 --> 36:45.405
Craps.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.752
[Cady]
Hi.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.344
My name is Cady L--

37:02.513 --> 37:04.845
Cady.
ls Mathias here?

37:10.938 --> 37:12.769
Some white girl to see you.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.640
[Mathias]
Let me see if I understand.

37:16.860 --> 37:20.899
You want to help me clear
my case backlog for free.

37:21.115 --> 37:22.480
I want to provide legal services

37:22.700 --> 37:24.440
to people who otherwise
wouldn't get them,

37:24.660 --> 37:27.151
whether they need a prosecutor
or a defender.

37:27.371 --> 37:28.486
For free?

37:28.872 --> 37:31.033
Well, I'm -- I'm not looking
to get rich.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.241
Then you've come
to the right place.

37:35.087 --> 37:38.545
Look, I'm trained as a lawyer,
and I'm tending bar.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.042
And even if I weren't,

37:40.259 --> 37:41.374
the more I learn about most law,

37:41.593 --> 37:43.299
the more I realize
it's not for me.

37:43.512 --> 37:44.922
But the Gabriella Langton rape

37:45.139 --> 37:47.255
showed me a way in which
I could use my education

37:47.474 --> 37:49.339
that won't make me hate myself.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.428
You Longmires are a strange lot.

37:56.400 --> 37:59.107
These are cases we forwarded
to the feds

37:59.319 --> 38:05.030
and that they declined to pursue
either for lack of funds...

38:05.951 --> 38:07.316
...Iack of evidence...

38:08.829 --> 38:11.036
...or just plain lack
of interest.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.159
You can have them for an hour.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.536
Make copies, bring them back.

38:19.715 --> 38:20.875
Thank you.

38:21.091 --> 38:22.877
I should take a picture
right now

38:23.093 --> 38:25.470
and write "before"
underneath it.

38:36.148 --> 38:37.763
[Walt]
It was right here.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.019
[Jerry] Well, how can you tell?
There's no landmarks.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.941
Sure there are.

38:42.154 --> 38:44.236
See that bird's nest?

38:44.448 --> 38:46.188
You want to mark the exact spot?

38:52.372 --> 38:55.990
So, Jerry, you said
you were robbed by two men.

38:56.210 --> 38:57.950
Could one of them
have been Cheyenne?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.285
[Jerry]
I don't know.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.291
Maybe.

39:02.049 --> 39:04.665
Were they big men? Small?

39:04.885 --> 39:06.421
Oh, big.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.966
And one of them
might have had long hair.

39:11.141 --> 39:14.178
Did you or Peter take out a loan
at the casino?

39:14.394 --> 39:16.100
-I didn't.
-What about Peter?

39:16.313 --> 39:18.019
Were you two together
the whole time?

39:18.232 --> 39:20.564
Yeah, except when he went
to the bathroom.

39:22.986 --> 39:26.444
There's some other folks
also got mugged.

39:26.657 --> 39:27.988
They gave us some details.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.116
Could this man
have been one of your attackers?

39:34.998 --> 39:36.329
Could be.

39:57.229 --> 39:58.059
Can I help you?

39:59.481 --> 40:00.857
Do you have any pliers

40:01.066 --> 40:03.648
that are a little more delicate
than this?

40:03.861 --> 40:05.397
Don't want your pliers
too delicate.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.398
Those there are guaranteed
for 25 years.

40:09.366 --> 40:10.526
to work in small spaces.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.868
I may have some in the back.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.739
[cellphone rings]

40:17.583 --> 40:19.164
-HeHo?
-[Ruby] Hi, Henry.

40:19.376 --> 40:20.912
I'm putting Walt through.

40:22.045 --> 40:23.376
Go ahead, Walt.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.295
[Walt]
Henry, I need to find someone.

40:26.091 --> 40:27.297
Who?

40:27.509 --> 40:30.626
Darius Burns,
uh, Malachi's thug.

40:30.846 --> 40:33.838
Remember I told you
I have this robbery homicide?

40:34.057 --> 40:37.424
Well, ljust found out that
Joe Lone Elk was robbed, too.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.181
He took out a loan from
the casino before he got mugged.

40:40.397 --> 40:41.807
Turns out he got the cash
from Darius,

40:42.024 --> 40:44.231
and now Darius has been
tentatively I.D.'d

40:44.443 --> 40:45.853
as one of the gunmen
by another victim,

40:46.069 --> 40:49.232
so any idea
where I might find Darius?

40:49.448 --> 40:51.814
As a matter of fact, yes.
My office at the Red Pony.

40:54.494 --> 40:55.870
Is he there right now?

40:57.497 --> 40:59.658
I cannot say for sure.
The door is closed.

40:59.875 --> 41:02.161
But he is usually around
at this time of day.

41:02.920 --> 41:05.206
Thanks, Henry.
I'll see you in a few.

41:08.508 --> 41:09.759
Sir?

41:21.355 --> 41:22.936
I think these will do.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.146
[Ferg] So, you can't describe
anything about them at all?

41:29.363 --> 41:31.570
No, I didn't get a look
at either of them.

41:31.782 --> 41:37.118
Look, if you hear anything else,
do not hesitate to call.

41:37.329 --> 41:38.535
[slots chiming]

41:49.675 --> 41:52.508
All righty, here we go.
3 on 13.

41:52.719 --> 41:54.584
Not a problem there, boss man.

41:54.805 --> 41:56.887
22. Not a problem.

41:57.099 --> 41:58.839
Here we go, guys.
Here we go.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.674
Red 30.
Wise choice, boss.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.055
All righty, no more bets, guys.
No more bets.

42:03.271 --> 42:04.306
[Monte]
Ferguson.

42:06.233 --> 42:07.769
Monte.

42:07.985 --> 42:09.100
What are you doing here?

42:09.319 --> 42:10.775
l was checking out
the new casino.

42:10.988 --> 42:12.694
Got a little time on my hands.
What about you?

42:12.906 --> 42:15.818
You guys still got two deputies
patrolling the whole county?

42:16.034 --> 42:17.990
Uh, well, three.

42:18.203 --> 42:20.489
Yeah, uh, Walt ended up
hiring Zachary Heflin.

42:20.706 --> 42:22.367
Unbelievable.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.702
He told Zachary and me both
he wasn't hiring either of us.

42:24.918 --> 42:29.457
Is that usually, uh [chuckles]
a part of his M.O., lying?

42:29.673 --> 42:31.004
Just probably
a misunderstanding.

42:31.216 --> 42:33.878
l was there.
Clear as a bell.

42:34.678 --> 42:36.418
Usually play those kind
of head games?

42:36.638 --> 42:40.972
Look, uh, the sheriff,
he's a secretive guy.

42:41.184 --> 42:43.675
He doesn't always tell you
what he's thinking or doing

42:43.895 --> 42:45.635
or even why.

42:45.856 --> 42:48.973
But, uh, he's a good man.

42:49.693 --> 42:51.024
ReaHy?

42:51.778 --> 42:54.315
-[man] Black 26!
-[crowd groans]

42:57.868 --> 43:00.484
I'm gonna get out your hair.
I'm bad luck for you.

43:03.957 --> 43:06.118
[rock music playing]

43:14.676 --> 43:16.507
Please make it fast, Sheriff.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.170
Where were you two nights ago?

43:20.390 --> 43:21.721
What time?

43:21.933 --> 43:23.434
Between midnight and 3:00 am.

43:23.643 --> 43:24.928
At the casino.

43:25.145 --> 43:26.555
You didn't leave at any point?

43:26.772 --> 43:28.353
Nope.

43:29.399 --> 43:31.435
You loan anybody money recently?

43:31.651 --> 43:32.811
No.

43:33.153 --> 43:35.064
So you're not loaning money
at high rates

43:35.280 --> 43:36.736
out of the casino bathroom?

43:38.575 --> 43:42.409
No. That sounds both illegal
and unsanitary.

43:42.621 --> 43:44.202
l have witnesses
that say different.

43:44.414 --> 43:47.702
[Darius] About my alibi
or about the bathroom loans?

43:49.377 --> 43:50.503
Both.

43:51.421 --> 43:54.128
Did they describe me?

43:54.841 --> 43:55.876
Yep.

43:56.259 --> 43:59.626
Dark skin, long hair,
scary-looking,

43:59.846 --> 44:02.223
talked in an Indian accent?

44:02.432 --> 44:04.093
Here's what they said.

44:04.309 --> 44:07.096
They owed you money
from illegal loans.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.099
They won it back at the casino
on the way out.

44:10.315 --> 44:14.524
They got mugged, probably by you
or one of Malachi's other guys.

44:14.736 --> 44:18.524
So, you got your money back, and
they still think they owe you.

44:18.740 --> 44:20.480
And I'm guessing
you raised the interest rates

44:20.700 --> 44:22.315
when they didn't make
the payments on time.

44:22.536 --> 44:24.026
"Guessing"?

44:24.246 --> 44:25.611
Am I under arrest for something?

44:28.708 --> 44:31.415
Then don't let the door
hit you in the ass.

44:47.978 --> 44:51.391
[Ferg] The sheriff,
he's a secretive guy.

45:39.988 --> 45:41.444
[clears throat]

45:41.656 --> 45:44.398
Well, this is
a funny coincidence.

45:44.618 --> 45:48.156
Well, I knew that you, uh,
had your group, uh, today,

45:48.371 --> 45:50.453
so I, um...

45:50.665 --> 45:52.826
All right, Sheriff.
What is this, hmm?

45:53.960 --> 45:55.245
I assume you have a reason

45:55.462 --> 45:56.793
for tracking me down
twice in two days,

45:57.005 --> 45:59.747
but you seem to not want
to share it with me.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.878
Well, earlier I was apologizing.

46:04.221 --> 46:06.928
No. You weren't.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.676
No, I was.

46:09.392 --> 46:10.802
Iwasn't. Uh...

46:13.563 --> 46:18.978
I-I guess I really, um,
didn't, um -- didn't, um...

46:19.778 --> 46:25.865
I mean, I did, um, somewhere
in the back of, um, my mind.

46:26.076 --> 46:29.159
But I, uh, was, um...

46:29.371 --> 46:30.827
It's been a long time.

46:31.039 --> 46:32.575
I'd, uh --

46:32.791 --> 46:35.703
I just feel we got off
on the wrong foot, obviously.

46:35.919 --> 46:38.376
Um, I was hoping
you would forget about that,

46:38.588 --> 46:41.796
and, uh, I'd like to ask you

46:42.008 --> 46:43.589
if you'd like to go for dinner
with me.

46:44.928 --> 46:46.793
There. I said it.
[chuckles]

46:47.013 --> 46:49.880
I mean, sometime soon.

46:51.851 --> 46:54.513
My God, that was excruciating.

46:54.729 --> 46:56.435
Yeah. Tell me about it.

46:56.648 --> 46:59.060
It was like watching you pass
a kidney stone or something.

46:59.276 --> 47:01.562
It's been a very long time
for me.

47:03.613 --> 47:05.274
What do you say?

47:05.490 --> 47:07.230
[clears throat]
Well, I, um...

47:10.787 --> 47:12.573
Well, I, um...

47:12.789 --> 47:14.780
I think I'm gonna pass.

47:18.878 --> 47:20.414
Oh.

47:20.630 --> 47:24.122
Look, I know, um --
I know you must be mad at me.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.878
No, no, no, that's not it.
That's not it.

47:26.094 --> 47:28.130
I know that you were just trying
to do your job, okay?

47:28.346 --> 47:30.507
But, you know, I just --
I-I spend --

47:30.724 --> 47:32.339
I spend all day

47:32.559 --> 47:35.471
trying to convince manly men
like yourself that --

47:35.687 --> 47:37.643
that, you know, they should
deal with their emotions,

47:37.856 --> 47:43.726
and I just don't want to do
the same thing on my free time.

47:43.945 --> 47:45.446
So...

47:46.448 --> 47:48.484
But that was very sweet.

47:55.081 --> 47:56.696
[sighs]

47:58.376 --> 48:00.492
[rock music playing]

48:09.846 --> 48:12.963
J‘J‘ I'm hitting the road
with no suitcase J‘J‘

48:15.685 --> 48:18.552
J‘J‘ Nobody knows where I'm going J‘J‘

48:18.772 --> 48:21.309
J‘J‘ Nobody knows where I'm from N

48:24.402 --> 48:26.017
[telephone ringing]

48:34.454 --> 48:36.035
Hello?

48:36.247 --> 48:38.738
The man who was mugged,
you said it was Joe Lone Elk?

48:38.958 --> 48:40.334
[Walt]
Yeah. Why?

48:40.543 --> 48:42.454
'Cause he just walked into
my office...

48:43.546 --> 48:47.414
...my former office --
with Darius.

48:47.634 --> 48:48.874
And he looked scared.

48:49.469 --> 48:51.881
Darius claims to have an alibi
for the time of the mugging.

48:52.097 --> 48:53.428
Not that I believe him.

48:54.391 --> 48:57.975
There is someone else with
him -- a man named Lane Potter.

48:58.978 --> 49:00.639
He is not a very good person.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.066
How do you know him?

49:04.275 --> 49:06.812
[Henry]
Only by reputation.

49:07.028 --> 49:08.643
But the fact that he is friends
with Darius

49:08.863 --> 49:10.148
confirms what I've heard.

49:11.366 --> 49:13.982
You think this Lane Potter
works for Darius?

49:14.202 --> 49:15.783
It certainly looks that way.

49:15.995 --> 49:17.451
Thanks, Henry.

49:26.005 --> 49:28.257
[Travis]
Mom! Door!

49:31.636 --> 49:33.547
Well, look who's here.

49:33.763 --> 49:35.378
Ms. Murphy,
l was, uh, wondering --

49:35.598 --> 49:37.805
I'm surprised you have the nerve
to show your face at this house.

49:38.560 --> 49:41.176
Do you have any idea
how hard Travis worked

49:41.396 --> 49:43.057
to get ready
for your job interview,

49:43.273 --> 49:44.888
how much it meant to him?

49:45.108 --> 49:46.689
And you wouldn't even
give him a chance.

49:46.901 --> 49:48.357
I appreciate
your son's passion --

49:48.570 --> 49:50.060
Oh, you most certainly do not.

49:50.280 --> 49:52.236
[Travis]
Mom! Who is it?

49:52.449 --> 49:54.781
[Mary Jo]
Sheriff High Horse.

49:54.993 --> 49:56.358
[chuckles]
Let him in.

49:56.578 --> 49:59.820
Why? So he can come here
and trample your dreams?

50:00.039 --> 50:01.825
Mom! Please!

50:02.041 --> 50:03.781
I'm sorry about that, Sheriff.

50:04.002 --> 50:06.084
My mom can be, uh,
a little overprotective.

50:06.296 --> 50:07.661
There you go.

50:07.881 --> 50:11.123
[police radio chatter]

50:11.342 --> 50:13.333
So, uh, what's up?

50:13.553 --> 50:16.260
ljust need to, um,
clarify a few things

50:16.473 --> 50:18.304
about your, uh -- your notes.

50:18.516 --> 50:19.676
Yeah, absolutely.

50:19.893 --> 50:21.178
You wrote 12:22.

50:21.352 --> 50:23.058
Is that the time
you encountered, uh, Jerry,

50:23.271 --> 50:24.852
or was that
when he was attacked?

50:25.064 --> 50:27.316
Uh...

50:27.525 --> 50:29.265
Maybe. Uh...

50:29.486 --> 50:31.522
Maybe it's when we arrived
back at the car.

50:31.738 --> 50:33.228
Uh-huh.

50:34.574 --> 50:35.780
What about this one?

50:35.992 --> 50:37.653
It says "car."

50:39.370 --> 50:40.621
Did Jerry give a description

50:40.830 --> 50:42.695
of the car
that ran him off the road?

50:44.417 --> 50:45.702
Maybe?

50:51.257 --> 50:52.667
Come on, Travis.

50:52.884 --> 50:55.466
Now we got a new suspect,
man named Lane Potter.

50:55.678 --> 50:57.384
He drives a blue Honda.

50:57.597 --> 51:00.589
Is there any chance that you
and Jerry talked about the car?

51:02.936 --> 51:05.143
Okay.
I remember now. Car.

51:05.355 --> 51:07.937
Um, he was just saying
that it wasn't the car

51:08.149 --> 51:09.605
that drove him off the road.

51:09.901 --> 51:13.689
Well, that's what -- He wasn't
talking about that car.

51:13.905 --> 51:15.736
Okay.
What was it?

51:15.949 --> 51:17.359
Well, Jerry was saying
that he wishes

51:17.575 --> 51:19.315
that he'd have driven
his own car that night,

51:19.536 --> 51:21.697
that things might have turned
out a little bit differently

51:21.913 --> 51:25.155
if, uh, his buddy didn't wind up
having to drive him home.

51:42.809 --> 51:44.094
Thanks, Travis.

51:44.310 --> 51:45.345
[Travis]
Yeah.

51:47.146 --> 51:48.602
[door closes]

51:54.904 --> 51:56.519
[knock on door]

52:00.201 --> 52:02.988
[Henry] Those are so
you can kick my ass.

52:03.204 --> 52:05.069
[sighs]
Henry.

52:09.168 --> 52:13.787
I was an idiot earlier,
and I am sorry.

52:14.007 --> 52:15.998
I thought I owed you
an explanation.

52:17.010 --> 52:19.501
No. You don't.

52:19.721 --> 52:21.052
I get it.

52:21.264 --> 52:23.129
And after what happened
with Gab,

52:23.349 --> 52:26.682
it'd be weird if you weren't
a little cynical.

52:26.894 --> 52:28.759
Well, you came in with
a big heart trying to help,

52:28.980 --> 52:33.349
and ljust rained all over
your idealism.

52:36.321 --> 52:37.652
It's okay.

52:39.657 --> 52:41.397
Come in.
I'll get you a beer.

52:42.577 --> 52:43.987
Thanks.

52:44.203 --> 52:48.242
I was just feeling powerless
and frustrated.

52:48.458 --> 52:49.618
I know the feeling.

52:49.834 --> 52:52.496
That's why I was trying
to do something.

52:59.260 --> 53:01.000
So, what happens
with a case like Gab's

53:01.220 --> 53:02.721
when the victim
will not testify?

53:02.930 --> 53:06.388
Does it just... go away?

53:08.394 --> 53:11.602
Those two guys -- Does anything
at all show up on their records?

53:13.149 --> 53:15.356
No.
They go scot-free.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.480
Do you still have your files?

53:24.035 --> 53:26.071
On the rape case?
Yeah.

53:26.287 --> 53:30.576
Are there... pictures
of Gab's assailants?

53:30.792 --> 53:32.874
I think so.
Why?

53:33.086 --> 53:35.202
[Henry] I was wondering
if I could see them.

53:36.381 --> 53:39.839
I find myself looking at
every man who comes into the bar

53:40.051 --> 53:41.916
and imagining he is one of them.

53:42.136 --> 53:44.627
It is difficult to provide
quality customer service

53:44.847 --> 53:46.132
under those circumstances.

53:58.277 --> 53:59.608
Here you go.

54:00.863 --> 54:02.979
Oh, I'll get you that beer.

54:14.877 --> 54:16.208
[camera shutter clicks]

54:20.133 --> 54:21.464
[camera shutter clicks]

55:01.924 --> 55:02.913
You need some help?

55:03.968 --> 55:07.005
Oh. Hey, Sheriff.
I didn't hear you drive up.

55:07.221 --> 55:09.177
I parked up the road a bit.

55:09.390 --> 55:11.346
I didn't want to disturb you.

55:11.559 --> 55:13.095
I didn't want you to run off.

55:13.311 --> 55:14.801
No danger of that.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.594
[Walt]
Right.

55:16.814 --> 55:19.476
I guess I meant to say
I didn't want you to drive off.

55:20.443 --> 55:21.353
Oh.

55:22.361 --> 55:23.942
Anyway, I got to thinking

55:24.155 --> 55:26.441
that this cross was a little
too close to the road.

55:26.657 --> 55:28.943
l was afraid somebody
might knock it down.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.991
I'm thinking I'm gonna build
a little grotto here

55:31.204 --> 55:32.785
so that Pete's father and family

55:32.997 --> 55:35.238
can come by
and light candles for him.

55:35.458 --> 55:38.791
At night when it's all lit up,
that's gonna be beautiful.

55:39.587 --> 55:41.999
Can you hand me
that cross there?

55:43.925 --> 55:46.416
Why'd you lie to me, Jerry?

55:47.428 --> 55:49.293
Why'd you say you needed a ride
out here?

55:49.514 --> 55:51.004
You got a car.

55:55.061 --> 55:57.347
Those hand controls...

55:57.563 --> 55:59.178
how do they work?

55:59.398 --> 56:02.481
Push down to brake, pull back
towards you to accelerate.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.649
I just got it out of the shop.

56:05.613 --> 56:07.854
You got a receipt for that work?

56:08.574 --> 56:11.065
Your car wasn't in the shop.

56:11.285 --> 56:14.448
You needed me --
not to drive you,

56:14.664 --> 56:16.495
to show you
where the shooting happened.

56:16.707 --> 56:18.243
Well, yes, so I could
put my cross up.

56:18.459 --> 56:21.417
No. So you could find
what you left behind that night.

56:22.129 --> 56:23.164
What?

56:24.298 --> 56:26.289
[Walt]
You were never robbed, Jerry.

56:26.509 --> 56:27.919
Of course we were,

56:28.135 --> 56:29.170
just like those other people
you told me about.

56:30.513 --> 56:32.219
[metal clinks]

56:46.612 --> 56:48.113
[blows]

57:05.631 --> 57:07.041
You shot Peter Hoyt.

57:11.304 --> 57:12.510
Oh, well.

57:12.722 --> 57:14.087
It was worth a try.

57:15.975 --> 57:17.886
I never really thought
I'd get away with it

57:18.102 --> 57:20.388
until you told me about
those other robberies.

57:22.398 --> 57:24.059
So, what happened that night?

57:26.527 --> 57:28.108
I told him to pull over

57:28.321 --> 57:31.484
'cause I was having a problem
with my colostomy bag.

57:31.699 --> 57:35.817
And when he came around to the
side of the car to help me out,

57:36.037 --> 57:39.495
I shot him right in the face.

57:39.707 --> 57:41.493
For this?

57:43.544 --> 57:46.126
ldon't think you killed him
for $3,000.

57:46.339 --> 57:48.295
No.

57:53.804 --> 57:56.216
Then why don't you tell me why?

57:56.432 --> 57:57.672
[Jerry]
Oh, I don't know.

58:00.853 --> 58:03.595
Or the chronic nightmares.

58:03.814 --> 58:08.478
Or the itch I imagine
in my dead, useless foot.

58:09.195 --> 58:11.732
I had a lot of reasons, Sheriff.

58:11.948 --> 58:14.655
I just knew
I was never gonna be okay

58:14.867 --> 58:17.700
until I erased him
from this earth.

58:19.747 --> 58:22.079
And then I got to thinking

58:22.291 --> 58:26.375
that that $3,000 would come
in handy for my medical bills.

58:27.171 --> 58:29.412
But that was kind of stupid.

58:31.801 --> 58:33.507
So you never forgave him.

58:36.722 --> 58:39.464
I'm not so sure
forgiveness exists.

58:40.768 --> 58:42.724
People talk about it a lot.

58:42.937 --> 58:45.098
It always seems like they're
trying to talk themselves

58:45.314 --> 58:48.306
into believing something
they know is horseshit.

58:49.819 --> 58:52.276
You put on a pretty good act.

58:52.488 --> 58:54.945
His family thinks
you were his friend.

58:55.157 --> 58:56.818
You testified
at his parole hearing.

58:57.034 --> 58:59.320
I had to.
[sniffs]

58:59.537 --> 59:01.949
l was getting scared
that he was gonna die in prison.

59:02.164 --> 59:04.746
And I don't know what I would
have done if that had happened.

59:05.835 --> 59:08.747
Planning his death
was all that kept me alive.

59:11.048 --> 59:12.254
Father Donahue told me

59:12.466 --> 59:15.128
that forgiveness
would bring me peace.

59:15.344 --> 59:16.629
He was wrong.

59:16.846 --> 59:19.804
I never forgave that asshole.

59:21.475 --> 59:23.306
But I'm at peace now.

59:39.493 --> 59:43.031
N All our sweetest sins J‘J‘

59:43.247 --> 59:45.408
J‘J‘ Carry them till our ends J‘J‘

59:45.624 --> 59:48.115
J‘J‘ They made you J‘J‘

59:49.336 --> 59:51.622
J‘J‘ And they made me J‘J‘

59:54.341 --> 59:57.048
J‘J‘ They say the dark will grow J‘J‘

59:58.471 --> 1:00:03.465
N In my eyes, across our skies,
it wrote If

1:00:04.852 --> 1:00:06.638
J‘J‘ Yeah, it wrote J‘J‘

1:00:06.854 --> 1:00:10.688
Hey, Ferg, I got a man
in custody in your car.

1:00:10.900 --> 1:00:13.232
I need you and Vic
to come pick him up.

1:00:13.444 --> 1:00:15.355
I'm near mile marker 10.

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:21.986
They'll be along soon enough.

1:00:22.203 --> 1:00:23.864
It's all good.

1:00:25.081 --> 1:00:26.912
J‘J‘ Ooh J‘J‘

1:00:27.124 --> 1:00:33.541
J‘J‘ Ooh J‘J‘

1:00:47.770 --> 1:00:52.013
J‘J‘ Ooh J‘J‘

1:00:52.233 --> 1:00:57.353
J‘J‘ Ooh J‘J‘

1:01:10.918 --> 1:01:12.954
[vehicle approaches]

1:01:13.170 --> 1:01:14.785
[engine shuts off]

1:01:35.109 --> 1:01:37.350
So, uh, Ruby called me.

1:01:37.570 --> 1:01:39.652
She said it was an emergency.

1:01:39.864 --> 1:01:41.855
I didn't say emergency.

1:01:42.032 --> 1:01:43.533
Well, she did.

1:01:43.701 --> 1:01:47.285
Well, Ruby can, uh,
be a bit dramatic sometimes.

1:01:47.496 --> 1:01:50.203
[Donna]
And this isn't dramatic?

1:01:50.416 --> 1:01:52.372
Sitting out here
on the side of the road

1:01:52.585 --> 1:01:55.748
having some sweet, old lady
do your bidding?

1:01:56.463 --> 1:02:00.081
Sheriff, are you afraid
to call me yourself?

1:02:00.301 --> 1:02:02.713
I don't own a cellphone.

1:02:02.928 --> 1:02:04.464
[Donna]
ReaHy?

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:05.965
Oh.

1:02:09.643 --> 1:02:13.261
All right, well, if this isn't
an emergency, then what is this?

1:02:14.231 --> 1:02:18.770
Well, I was just out for a walk.
Um, I was doing some thinking.

1:02:18.986 --> 1:02:23.150
I wanted to talk,
so I had Ruby call you for me.

1:02:24.742 --> 1:02:29.452
I see. Well, that's
very high-school of you.

1:02:30.414 --> 1:02:31.915
Tell you what,
if you want to talk,

1:02:32.082 --> 1:02:34.869
why don't you try calling
and making an appointment?

1:02:38.422 --> 1:02:40.003
I killed a man.

1:02:47.306 --> 1:02:48.261
When?

1:02:49.308 --> 1:02:50.923
Couple of months ago.

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:16.535
You ever read John Donne?

1:03:16.752 --> 1:03:19.744
Mm-hmm.
In college.

1:03:20.965 --> 1:03:26.585
I remember a poem about a flea,
but it was really about sex.

1:03:26.804 --> 1:03:28.044
Different poem.

1:03:31.100 --> 1:03:34.092
"Every man's death
diminishes me,

1:03:34.311 --> 1:03:37.144
for I am involved in Mankind."

1:03:38.732 --> 1:03:40.768
It always made sense to me.

1:03:41.652 --> 1:03:43.062
Till a couple of months ago.

1:03:47.491 --> 1:03:49.322
What was his name?

1:03:51.287 --> 1:03:52.493
Barlow.

1:03:53.580 --> 1:03:54.706
I shot him.

1:03:56.083 --> 1:03:57.948
Twice.

1:03:59.211 --> 1:04:01.497
But his death
didn't diminish me.

1:04:01.714 --> 1:04:05.798
It... lifted a weight off of me.

1:04:08.971 --> 1:04:11.053
And you feel guilty about that?

1:04:11.807 --> 1:04:15.891
Well, I feel guilty
about not feeling guilty.

1:04:21.775 --> 1:04:24.027
Why are you
talking about this now?

1:04:25.654 --> 1:04:28.270
ljust met this guy
who did something wrong

1:04:28.490 --> 1:04:31.232
for understandable reasons,
and...

1:04:31.452 --> 1:04:33.408
he has no regrets.

1:04:34.246 --> 1:04:35.361
None.

1:04:36.582 --> 1:04:38.698
I wish I could feel that way.

1:04:46.425 --> 1:04:48.461
Did you do something wrong?

1:04:48.677 --> 1:04:50.053
No.

1:04:50.262 --> 1:04:51.342
No.

1:04:52.598 --> 1:04:54.463
Man I killed deserved it.

1:04:55.893 --> 1:05:00.978
I feel better now he's gone,
lighter, more at ease.

1:05:04.026 --> 1:05:06.358
This is you at ease?

1:05:08.405 --> 1:05:10.020
This is me at ease.

1:05:11.533 --> 1:05:14.320
I even have dreams
from time to time now.

1:05:15.579 --> 1:05:17.194
Some pretty good ones.

1:05:21.168 --> 1:05:26.458
So, you feel bad
about feeling good, hmm?

1:05:27.424 --> 1:05:28.834
Isn't that just feeling bad?

1:05:29.051 --> 1:05:30.666
No, I don't think so.

1:05:32.179 --> 1:05:34.921
I think that you have
forgiven yourself

1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:37.756
for something
that you consider unforgivable.

1:05:38.519 --> 1:05:39.884
Well, it is unforgivable.

1:05:40.104 --> 1:05:41.640
To kill another man,
that's never okay.

1:05:41.855 --> 1:05:43.766
But you said he deserved it.

1:05:45.275 --> 1:05:46.401
He did.

1:05:47.861 --> 1:05:49.817
Did you do anything illegal?

1:05:51.281 --> 1:05:53.567
The FBI cleared me, so...

1:05:57.454 --> 1:05:58.785
Well, then.

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:09.796
It feels strange.

1:06:11.343 --> 1:06:12.799
Of course it does.

1:06:13.637 --> 1:06:16.549
Forgiveness isn't a natural
thing for most people.

1:06:19.101 --> 1:06:22.593
But I guess
you're not most people.

1:06:38.996 --> 1:06:40.952
[engine turns over]

1:06:48.672 --> 1:06:51.835
You were seriously
just gonna let me drive away?

1:06:53.135 --> 1:06:55.217
You have no car.
