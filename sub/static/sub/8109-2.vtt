We gotta make up for
that in pure firepower.

You want to raid

don't you?

00:36.495 --> 00:37.951

Still working on it.
The code's a little janky.

01:45.939 --> 01:49.147
Hey, boss,
you just like watching us
get our asses shredded?

01:49.234 --> 01:50.519
Yeah, not that
you're not hilarious,

01:50.611 --> 01:53.728
but we hit the shelves
in three months.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.033
Vince?

01:59.202 --> 02:01.033
Vince, what's wrong?

02:02.831 --> 02:05.743
My hands,
they're on fire.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.073
Your NCV test was normal.
Rules out carpal tunnel.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.830
No evidence of trauma,
your blood work looks normal.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.912
Then what is it?
I don't know.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.621
l'll arrange to
have you transferred
to a neurologist.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.458

Don't you have some
famous diagnostics guy?

02:57.552 --> 02:58.587

03:08.772 --> 03:10.182
You can't quit.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.184
I think you're confusing me
with Jake Gyllenhaal.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.264
House, are you okay?

03:13.360 --> 03:16.022
Yeah. And I want
to stay that way.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.353
I talked it over
with my therapist.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.483
I need to change
my environment,
my habits.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.439
But he cleared you to
get your license back.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.117
Which will help immensely
with my newjob in research.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.822
I've sent out some resumes.
Research means no patients,
less pressure.

03:27.916 --> 03:31.374

have you had enough time
to think this through?

(SIGHS)

03:34.631 --> 03:35.962
I'm sorry.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.546

affect both of you,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.628
and Thirteen,
and the one with the nose.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.929
But I just can't
risk coming back here.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.306
Okay.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.366
That was surprising.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.662
I want to run
the department.

04:15.130 --> 04:17.587
You consider waiting
until House clears the lobby

04:17.674 --> 04:19.380
before you start angling
for his job?

04:19.468 --> 04:20.958
He's not dead
or sentimental,

04:21.052 --> 04:22.303
and somebody
needs to do it.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.048
Not necessarily.

04:24.347 --> 04:26.599
Departments of
diagnostic medicine
don't exist.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.265
The only reason we have one
is because of House.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.594
You reassigned us,
kept us on payroll
for three months,

04:32.689 --> 04:33.849
you might as well
give me a chance.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.055
You're a great doctor,

04:35.150 --> 04:39.519
I want you to
stay on in Neuro,
but House was a genius.

04:39.613 --> 04:43.231
House was an egotistical,
pill-popping,
lawsuit magnet.

04:44.409 --> 04:45.615
And a genius.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.786
And lworked with him
longer than anybody else.
I can do this.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.661
You get one shot.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.132
What's House gonna do?

05:03.220 --> 05:04.926
FOREMAN: No idea,
but he's gone,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.220
so how about we focus
on the medicine?

05:08.225 --> 05:09.556
What?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.508
You're the boss,
it's kind of sexy.

it was just the pants.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.070

That's a good idea.
Let's run with it.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.028
Look at that. No House,
the job still gets done.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.279
And yet,
something's missing.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.987
l'm short, he's black,

well understood, but...

05:43.093 --> 05:45.835

on Broadway?
Google it.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.299
It's pretty hard to
consume enough fish

05:52.394 --> 05:53.725
to give yourself
mercury poisoning,

05:53.812 --> 05:55.848
and it doesn't usually
present solely with pain.

05:55.939 --> 05:59.022
But it can.

when you've got
the Internet?

06:07.075 --> 06:08.690
No offense,
but doctors make mistakes.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.525
Medical errors are
up 30% this year.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.451
You should check
the rate of patient error.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.451
There's a ton of

Why wouldn't I
educate myself,
be my own advocate?

06:18.169 --> 06:19.705
CRPS came up in
my search, too,

06:19.796 --> 06:21.457
but I've never had
any skin discoloration,

06:21.548 --> 06:23.664
and my pain is sporadic,
not constant.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.793
It's gotta be worth
one lousy blood test.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.253

House feels

07:04.341 --> 07:05.672
about people
touching his ball.

No, Chase refuses
to tell me.

cool with it?

07:20.732 --> 07:22.848
He's older than you.
She's seen you naked.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.104
Not like we haven't
been working together
for two years now.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.232
Working with is different
than working for.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.951
You saw House,
how was he?

07:32.035 --> 07:35.027
He was good.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.739
He was honest,
took responsibility.
It was kind of weird.

on her ER transfer.

She and Taub are doing
a spinal stimulation.

07:46.383 --> 07:47.498
No, they're not.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.924
ljust dropped a patient
in the cath suite,

07:50.011 --> 07:52.502
and your guys
were not in there.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.808
You know, usually,
spinal stimulation

07:58.895 --> 08:00.396
is done with the patient
in the room.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.516
He asked us to test
his blood for mercury.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.347
lt's unlikely,
but not impossible.

08:04.442 --> 08:05.693
It's also not
what we agreed on.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.483
Testing doesn't hurt,
and it only takes
20 minutes.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.650
I figured
it didn't matter.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.275
I'm thinking I should
decide when it matters.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.153

to do with my time,
and my leg.

since I left Mayfield.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.101
lbuprofen's barely
putting a dent in it.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.928
You need a hobby.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.389
Right. Doctors the world
over treat chronic pain

08:45.483 --> 08:46.984
with collections
of Hummel figurines.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.979
No, I didn't say
you need a lame hobby.

08:49.070 --> 08:52.813
You need something
to keep you engaged,
connected to other people.

08:52.907 --> 08:54.772
You already made me
get a roommate.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.028
Wilson's got
one bedroom.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.156
I don't think we can
get any more connected
without unzipping.

08:59.247 --> 09:02.239
Okay. So what does
Wilson like to do?

09:06.588 --> 09:09.500
Vince, l'm Dr. Foreman,
Head of Diagnostics.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.832
So you must be
the genius's replacement.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.633
I prefer to think of
myself as Genius 2.0.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.302
Your blood test
ruled out
mercury poisoning.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.137
What was
my mercury level?
Two-point-eight.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.304
That means for every
deciliter of blood...

09:19.392 --> 09:21.724
I know what it means.
I also know
it's above normal.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.893
I want mercury chelation.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.221
Your level isn't
elevated enough
to produce your symptoms.

09:26.316 --> 09:29.353
You can't know that
until we de-elevate it
and see if my pain improves.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.900
It's a judgment call.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.228
Based on 10 years
of medical training?

09:33.323 --> 09:36.030
I think you have CRPS.
I want to try
spinal stimulation.

09:36.117 --> 09:41.157
So, basically, you want to
shove a needle in my spine
based on a glorified hunch.

09:41.247 --> 09:43.329
I'll stick with
the chelation.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.835
If you don't
want to get better,
I think we're done.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.208
What do you mean "done"?

09:51.299 --> 09:53.255
You're not interested
in my medical opinion.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.753
I'll move on to
my next patient,

09:54.844 --> 09:55.924
you'll move on
to a doctor

09:56.012 --> 09:57.718
willing to run
all the unnecessary tests

09:57.806 --> 10:01.674
and procedures you want.
Or you can stick
around and be cured.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.344
Makes no difference to me.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.689
I'm glad you
changed your mind.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.266
Don't know about that.

10:11.361 --> 10:14.148
Dr. Foreman basically
strong-armed me.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.987
Which is impressive.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.315
Stimulating at 100 hertz.

10:18.409 --> 10:21.901
Guess you found him
a little more persuasive
than the two of us.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.782
Probably the pants.

10:23.873 --> 10:25.454
He reminds me of me.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.123
Is it supposed to hurt?

10:28.211 --> 10:29.451
Not if we're
in correctly.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.332
Is it your hands?
Your back?

10:31.422 --> 10:32.958
No, my chest.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.683
His lungs are
filling with fluid.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.435
Analysis of the fluid
from Vince's lungs
shows the lung problem

10:55.530 --> 10:56.815
is really
a heart problem.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.862
He's got a thickened
left ventricle.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.531
When his heart sped up
during the procedure,

11:00.618 --> 11:04.110
itjacked up
the pressure in his lungs,
causing pulmonary edema.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.366
Good thing I
talked the patient
into spinal stimulation.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.448
It did lead us
to discovering
a new symptom,

11:08.543 --> 11:10.283
and proved he was wrong
about mercury poisoning.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.788
We lucked into
that discovery,

11:11.880 --> 11:14.087
and we were wrong
about CRPS.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.583
Ventricular thickening
plus neuropathy could
equal Lyme disease.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.883
Not without joint pain.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.926
When's his new game
coming out?

11:21.014 --> 11:22.003
Couple of months.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.178
He's probably
working non-stop.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.131
Might be using
more than coffee
to power through.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.012
Cocaine use
explains his symptoms.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.843
So we search his
office for drugs.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.270
No. We're gonna ask him.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.108
In a lot of ways,
cooking is like music.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.532
isn't going to
be poop tomorrow.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.034
What was
my one condition

11:49.125 --> 11:51.116
for allowing you
to tag along?

11:51.211 --> 11:52.792
Try not to be a jerk.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.086
I'm trying.
I'm just failing.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.877
Roll your meatballs
and keep an open mind.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.555
How hard are you trying
not to make a ball joke
right now?

12:05.642 --> 12:07.257
They're smoking.

12:08.478 --> 12:09.843
Your balls.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.223
Oh.

12:11.314 --> 12:13.521
No, no. They're browning
way too fast.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.189
Blue's the color
you gotta watch out for.

12:15.276 --> 12:16.812
Enough.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.732
God, they're...
They're still raw inside.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.813
By the time
they're cooked through,
the outside will be burnt.

12:21.908 --> 12:24.900
I think there's
a medicated powder for that.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.738
Although,
vinegar could work.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.075
My old chem prof
talked about

12:33.169 --> 12:34.329
theoretically
you shouldn't trust

12:34.420 --> 12:36.411
the results of
a hemoglobin A1C test

12:36.506 --> 12:38.872
on a chronically
acidotic patient.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.086
The acid in the blood
slows the reaction

12:41.177 --> 12:44.214
between
the hemoglobin protein
and blood sugar.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.216
Browning meat
is the same
chemical process,

12:46.307 --> 12:50.016
which means
it should also
be slowed by acid.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.094
That actually
makes sense.

12:53.022 --> 12:55.729
You might have
saved my balls.

12:55.817 --> 12:57.478
That's the spirit!

12:59.445 --> 13:01.436
Obviously the procedure
didn't go as planned.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.816
The heart problem
was unforeseeable,

13:02.907 --> 13:04.443
but I still feel
responsible.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.523
I'm sorry.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.778
Okay.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.531
How long have you guys
been doing it?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.743
I think it's best
ifwe kept things
professional.

13:12.834 --> 13:13.949
Tough to do,
now that I've seen

13:14.043 --> 13:15.624
you rock
a leopard-print bikini.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.953
Congrats, by the way.
Up top.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.713
You hacked
my profile page?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.665
Your treatment nearly
gave me a heart attack.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.217
Figured I'd check if
you had the credentials
to go with the cojones,

13:25.305 --> 13:26.385
one search
led to another.

13:26.472 --> 13:27.587
Is there a shot
ofjust her?

13:27.682 --> 13:28.888
I'm thinking screensaver.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.632
We need to know
if you've been
using cocaine.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.763
Nope. Dude,
you just block everybody

13:32.854 --> 13:34.139
or do you really
only have three friends?

13:34.230 --> 13:35.845
We need you to be
straight with us.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.397
We need to be
able to trust you.

13:38.735 --> 13:42.023
I cleaned up my act
12 years ago,

13:42.113 --> 13:43.944
after my college
roommate OD'd.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.200
Okay.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.329
Search his office.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.409
You think he was lying?

13:58.504 --> 14:00.040
No, but I'm not sure.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.120
It was worth asking.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.671
If he'd said yes,
it would've
saved us a trip.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.420
But he didn't.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.502
You have to forget
about him.

14:07.597 --> 14:09.633
The patient?
House.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.214
First you try
acting like him,

14:11.309 --> 14:13.345
that doesn't work,
so then you try
the opposite.

14:13.436 --> 14:16.553
Now you're mad
because you have
to use his move.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.062
Ifeeler
Tom Brady's backup.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.857
Tom Brady's backup
now makes $10 million.

14:21.944 --> 14:25.277
Stop comparing.
You can do this
by being you.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.403
We should still
check out his office,
talk to his co-workers.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.483
I'll get Taub.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.567
And

14:32.705 --> 14:33.945
thanks.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.865
Oh. And dinner
tonight at 7:00.

14:36.959 --> 14:37.994
Can we make it 8:00?

14:38.086 --> 14:40.122
Already made
a reservation for 7:00.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.416
Hi.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.671
I'm making gnocchi.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.137
Oh, I didn't mean
to intrude, ljust...

14:55.228 --> 14:57.765
Cecile's in
my cooking class.

14:57.855 --> 14:58.935
She doesn't
speak English.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.274
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)

15:06.447 --> 15:08.529
You bake the potatoes
instead of boiling.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.699
Less moisture,
fewer gluten bonds,
lighter gnocchi.

15:11.786 --> 15:12.901
You seem good.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.121
Feeling better.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.070
(CONTINUES SPEAKING
MANDARIN)

15:21.003 --> 15:22.083
House.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.002
I need to talk to you
about your leaving
the hospital.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.627
I do love a good groveling,
but my decision is final.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.880
That's fine,
as long as I'm not
the reason for it.

15:29.971 --> 15:31.586
I know that sounds
completely narcissistic.

15:31.681 --> 15:33.262
Yeah.

15:34.517 --> 15:39.056
But it's not. We flirted,
we kissed, I fondled.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.103
I hallucinated
a night with you

15:41.190 --> 15:43.647
and yelled it from
a hospital balcony.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.645
You're not a narcissist.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.189
So what am I?

15:48.281 --> 15:49.396
Not the reason
I'm leaving.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.447
House.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.954
I'm gonna miss you.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.584
Lady,
either kiss him or leave.
We got work to do.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.871
You just couldn't
keep your trap shut.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.081
Make the damn gnocchi.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.211
Bye.

16:17.435 --> 16:18.470
TAUB: I guess you're
not in a hurry

16:18.561 --> 16:20.176

to the office.

I'm not trying to
avoid my boyfriend.

16:30.865 --> 16:32.730
I'm a lizard,
not an idiot.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.315
You've been
in a crappy mood

16:34.410 --> 16:35.490
since we got
in the car.

16:35.578 --> 16:38.115
And you're completely okay
with being ordered
around by someone

16:38.206 --> 16:41.289
who 24 hours ago was
basically your equal?

16:41.375 --> 16:44.082
Unlike you,
I didn't expect
anything different.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.752
The work part
I can get used to.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.627
He didn't ask me
to go to dinner,
he told me we were going.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.338
He's never
done that before.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.466
So even the score.
Go home tonight,

16:56.557 --> 16:58.218
put on some heels and
break him like a pony.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.597
You'll feel much better.
What?

17:03.481 --> 17:07.190
That's one big-ass bird.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.312
(SHRIEKING)

17:14.617 --> 17:17.108
Wow.
That's kind of amazing,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.364
the way the wings move,
it's so real.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.286
Get them off me!

17:22.458 --> 17:24.039
I know what's wrong
with the patient.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.991
I'm going
to call Foreman.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.454
A little help.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.210
Your partner said
you studied birds

17:32.301 --> 17:33.632
to improve
the game animation.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.755
Did you touch them?
Can't dissect
without touching.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.177
It's the best way to
understand the anatomy.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.382
It's also a good way
to contract an infection
called psittacosis.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.058
We spoke to Dr. Foreman,
he wants to start you
on antibiotics.

17:43.145 --> 17:47.388
Does that infection
cause problems
in the joystick area?

17:47.483 --> 17:48.893
Kind of stuck
in play mode.

17:48.985 --> 17:51.818
Yes, we get it.
She's very, very pretty.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.691
It's not her.
I mean, it was,

17:54.782 --> 17:56.943
when she was here
with her boyfriend
three hours ago.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.992
You've had an erection
for three hours?

18:01.455 --> 18:02.661
At first, it was
just embarrassing,

18:02.748 --> 18:04.204
but now it's
really starting to hurt.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.452
Will the antibiotics help?

18:05.543 --> 18:08.626
I'm afraid not.
This isn't psittacosis.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.373
TAUB: His erection persisted
even with medication.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.878
We had to put in
a surgical shunt

18:15.970 --> 18:17.176
justto
drain the blood.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.551
You missed dinner.
And a shunt doesn't
require both of you.

18:20.641 --> 18:24.304
I'm dedicated.
So, the holy trinity,
heaﬂ,hands,hose.

18:24.395 --> 18:25.430
TAUB: Could be
Guillain-Barré.

Not with normal
nerve conduction.

His platelet count
isn't that high.

Honest,
I wasn't laughing

the obvious tension
between the two of you.

It is possible
for a brain tumor
to cause...

We're going with
thrombocytosis.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.752
Okay.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.590
You're mad I didn't
ask you to dinner?

19:00.681 --> 19:02.057
How long have
we been dating?

19:02.141 --> 19:03.256
It felt like an order.

19:03.351 --> 19:04.340
Your tone of voice was...

19:04.435 --> 19:05.424
My tone?

19:05.519 --> 19:06.508
I'm under a little
pressure right now.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.639
How about
giving me a break?

19:07.730 --> 19:09.391
Look, this is tough
for both of us,

19:09.482 --> 19:11.347
except I haven't
just gotten a promotion.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.273
So, now you're jealous?

19:13.361 --> 19:15.226
No. I'm just saying
don't complain

19:15.321 --> 19:17.812
about the burdens
of command
to your employees.

19:17.907 --> 19:20.569

to my girlfriend.

Nice to meet you.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.330
You called
another doctor?

19:36.425 --> 19:39.292
Lots of other doctors.
I posted my symptoms
on the Internet.

for some backup.

they all are.

DR. PAULSON: Dr. Foreman,
sorry for the intrusion,

19:57.822 --> 20:00.438
but I notice
you haven't done
a head MRI yet.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.522
Because he doesn't
need one.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.198
I'm pretty sure
he's got a brain tumor.

20:03.285 --> 20:06.413
We considered that and
concluded thrombocytosis
is more likely.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.953
I'm starting him
on hydroxyurea.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.656
His platelets don't seem
anywhere near high enough.

If you took an image,
I'm sure...

There are no signs
of increased ICP.

a tiebreaker.

Dr. Hadley,
what do you think?

20:20.136 --> 20:22.172
I think both theories
have merit.

20:22.263 --> 20:26.222
So, brain tumor,
otherwise you'd back
your boss/boyfriend.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.390

21:02.052 --> 21:03.758

in which case...

21:06.515 --> 21:08.255
No, bed is still

up to 11.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.516
Yeah, I thought
you were trying
to tone that down.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.977
No, I'm just trying
to find something
I can set at 11

21:21.071 --> 21:22.572

out my eardrums.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.487

the caramelized onions,

21:24.575 --> 21:27.692

I couldn't sleep
because of my leg.

21:33.417 --> 21:37.410
It was either make ragu
or go out on the street
looking to score.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.634
Good choice.
So, so good.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.640
He asked me a question,
I answered.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.141
You told me to make
my own decisions,

21:57.233 --> 21:58.598
I do, and you stab me
in the back.

21:58.692 --> 21:59.977
I didn't even say
what I really thought.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.310

Except the team opinion
is your opinion.

22:11.205 --> 22:12.741
That's myjob.
And what's mine?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.539
To lie when I'm asked
a direct question?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.288
You would have
done it for House.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.244
Maybe you just don't
want me to succeed.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.546
Maybe you just want
to kick me again

22:22.633 --> 22:24.589
for not asking you
to dinner.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.510
At least when
House was being
an unbelievable jerk,

22:27.596 --> 22:29.336
I could talk to
my boyfriend about it.

but you're wrong.

22:46.615 --> 22:48.276

22:48.367 --> 22:51.404
I knew you'd show up here
complaining about Foreman.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.282
I thought you'd hold out
for another week at least.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.409
I showed up to ask
if you've seen
thromobocytosis

22:56.500 --> 22:57.580
with a platelet
count under...

22:57.668 --> 23:00.626

not stupid.

his inner Mugabe.

some of the yolk and
replace it with ragu.

By the way,
you can tell

23:15.436 --> 23:16.892
that their absence
has been noted.

He posted his case online.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.453
You know Foreman,
you know the situation.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.625
How can I get him
to tone it down?

23:41.712 --> 23:43.248
Stop being a coward,
for one thing.

23:43.339 --> 23:44.579
He's the one who's
afraid of failure.

23:44.673 --> 23:47.164
In a job that
no one before me
has ever done.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.250
His fears are justified.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.427
You're just afraid
of giving him
control over you.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.548
Which might work
at home,

23:52.640 --> 23:54.756
but makes it
almost impossible
for him to do his job.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.761
Pass me those crackers.

23:57.895 --> 24:00.227
You're saying
this is all my fault?

that you would be happier
if you learned when
it's okay to give in.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.102
What?

24:09.198 --> 24:12.861
You just suggested
that I give in
so that I could be happy.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.033
What did they do
to you in there?

24:56.412 --> 24:58.494
Challenging you
is part of herjob.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.320
But when she does it,
you take it personally.

You gotta eliminate
either the challenge
or the reaction.

Or we could stick
with my original plan.

for a while,

I got bored.

my blaster.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.090
He's hallucinating
'cause he's burning up.

35:38.178 --> 35:40.043
Amyloidosis wouldn't
do this.

35:45.894 --> 35:47.225
THIRTEEN: Antipyretics
didn't work.

35:47.312 --> 35:50.349
Hopefully the cold tub
will get his temp down.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.523
Maybe we should see
if anyone's sent in
other ideas.

35:53.610 --> 35:54.816
Maybe the reward
money attracted...

35:54.903 --> 35:57.235
No, I'm not letting
anyone else jerk us around.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.563
The masses were wrong
about amyloidosis.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.114
They don't know
about the fever.

36:01.201 --> 36:04.409
I'm going with Light-Chain
Deposition Disorder.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.487
You okay with that?

36:06.581 --> 36:07.661
Yes.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.583
We think you have
a disease called LCDD.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.760
It causes proteins
to build up
in your organs.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.256
You think?

36:24.391 --> 36:27.303
We can't definitely
confirm the diagnosis.

36:27.769 --> 36:28.975
And our only chance
of beating this

36:29.062 --> 36:31.929
would be to start you on
high-dose chemotherapy.

36:32.023 --> 36:36.187
But I do have to warn you
that in your condition,
it might kill you.

36:39.447 --> 36:42.564
Do you want me to get you
some more information?

36:43.451 --> 36:46.614
You're my doctor,
I trust you.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.155
No, you don't.

36:50.250 --> 36:52.787
You're scared,
and you don't want
to make this decision.

37:02.137 --> 37:05.379
My career is
riding on this case.

37:05.473 --> 37:07.464
Nowhere near as
important as your life.

37:09.936 --> 37:14.100
But I think the best shot
for both of us is
to treat for LCDD.

37:16.192 --> 37:17.398
Okay.

37:20.155 --> 37:23.864
All right.
Let's get you out of
this tub and into chemo.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.824
WILSON: We know you're
back on Vicodin.

37:29.914 --> 37:30.903
No.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.785
The only thing
you know is
that I'm a genius

37:32.876 --> 37:35.208
who got a dog to pee
in your toilet.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.705
You don't know
how I did it,

37:36.796 --> 37:39.082
or, more interestingly,
where I peed.

37:39.174 --> 37:41.256
House, you've spent
the last three months...

37:41.342 --> 37:43.003
Et tu, Butte?

37:43.094 --> 37:44.083
You got no reason
to be here,

37:44.179 --> 37:45.294
he's the one
I was jerking around.

37:45.388 --> 37:46.924
Why is your leg better?

37:47.015 --> 37:50.098
Owl It hurts.
Please go away now.

37:50.185 --> 37:51.300
If you really think
I'm using,

37:51.394 --> 37:53.635
how about asking me
before taking a wrench
to your plumbing?

37:53.730 --> 37:54.810
House,
you're an addict.

37:54.898 --> 37:57.935
You can't be surprised
if we can't take you
at your word.

37:58.026 --> 38:02.986
Fine.
Let's get you some proof.
Hide your eyes, ladies.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.360
House.
You, too.

38:06.701 --> 38:08.612
(HOUSE URINATING)

38:08.703 --> 38:09.943
(SIGHS)

38:10.330 --> 38:12.616
My godson
made me that mug.

38:12.707 --> 38:14.618
If the lab says
this is Retriever, too,

38:16.169 --> 38:17.625
It'd explain my
overwhelming desire

38:17.712 --> 38:20.249
to wipe my butt
on your carpet.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.132
Thank you for
dragging me into this.

38:44.280 --> 38:47.488
Stop the chemo,
he's got Fabry's disease.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.610
He was in a tub
for an hour,

38:48.701 --> 38:50.828
his fingers
should have pruned,
but they didn't.

38:50.912 --> 38:54.370
Already stopped chemo,
and confirmed Fabry's.

38:54.457 --> 38:58.041
I'm glad you both agree
but could somebody
loop me in here?

38:58.127 --> 38:59.958
We assumed the deposits
in your kidneys

39:00.046 --> 39:02.128
were proteins,
but they were fats.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.548
Fabry's makes them
build up in your organs,
choke your nerves,

39:05.635 --> 39:08.172
keep your fingers
from pruning in water.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.673
It's chronic
but manageable.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.800
How did you
figure it out?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.105
Iodide mumps.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.225
His lymph nodes
swelled up
after the head CT.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.602
We thought it was
a new symptom,
but it wasn't,

39:22.694 --> 39:24.434
it was a reaction
to the contrast.

39:24.529 --> 39:26.520
Iodide mumps
takes lymph nodes
off the table.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.775
Remove that symptom...

39:29.909 --> 39:31.945
And that just
came to you?

39:33.454 --> 39:35.991
I looked through
the online responses again.

39:36.082 --> 39:38.073
Someone posted it
this morning.

39:47.260 --> 39:48.670
(DOOR OPENS)

39:52.307 --> 39:53.592
I heard Cuddy
made it official.

39:53.683 --> 39:56.299
Department's yours.
Congrats.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.313
I'm sorry.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.308
I went behind your back.

40:05.403 --> 40:08.315
On a scale of one to 10,
how mad are you?

40:09.449 --> 40:13.158
A seven.
And that's stupid.

40:14.495 --> 40:15.780
You did the right thing.

40:15.872 --> 40:17.908
It's my fault
you thought you had
to go behind my back.

40:17.999 --> 40:19.114
I should have
stood up to you.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.336
But you didn't 'cause
you didn't want
to fight again.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.211
It's our first case,
it'll take time to adjust.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.836
What if by the time
we get adjusted,

40:33.932 --> 40:36.514
we don't like
each other any more?

40:36.601 --> 40:37.761
That's not
gonna happen.

40:37.852 --> 40:39.012
Are you sure?

40:39.103 --> 40:40.309
'Cause ever since
I took this job,

40:40.396 --> 40:43.559
we've been making
each other miserable.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.437
I really don't think
this is gonna work.

40:56.454 --> 40:57.819
You're breaking up
with me?

40:57.914 --> 40:58.949
No.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.828
The other night,
when I thought I was done,
you were there.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.868
I need you.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.206
I don't want
to lose you.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.005
Then, why are you...

41:20.728 --> 41:22.389
You're firing me.

41:27.860 --> 41:29.236
I'm sorry.

41:34.117 --> 41:35.527
Ispred.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.860
You took Vicodin?

41:46.796 --> 41:48.161
(READING) $25,000.

41:49.966 --> 41:52.332
I solved
my old team's case.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.133
I was about
to take the pills,
I went online,

41:55.221 --> 41:58.008
I found people
posting medical problems.

41:58.099 --> 42:02.433
And my leg
stopped hurting.

42:05.064 --> 42:06.144
Oh.

42:07.650 --> 42:08.765
Oh?

42:10.778 --> 42:13.736
I'm supposed to be
changing my life.
This is not a change.

42:13.823 --> 42:15.859
Maybe I was wrong.

42:15.950 --> 42:18.282
Says the guy
making sand castles
in my brain.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.870
We need to keep you
from using.

42:19.954 --> 42:22.115
Taking yourjob away,
the medical puzzles,

42:22.206 --> 42:23.707
nearly drove you
back to it.

42:23.791 --> 42:29.002
Maybe diagnostic medicine
is the key to
keeping you clean.

42:31.382 --> 42:34.670
So you're okay
with me going online,
solving cases?

42:34.761 --> 42:35.967
No.

42:36.637 --> 42:38.764
You can't sit all day
in a room by yourself.

42:38.848 --> 42:41.385
Isolation fosters
depression.

42:41.476 --> 42:43.432
The hospital is
part of my old life.

42:43.519 --> 42:46.886
If I go back,
I might become

42:46.981 --> 42:49.063
who I was before,
pills and all.

42:49.150 --> 42:51.061
That's a possibility.

42:51.152 --> 42:53.359
But could be,

42:53.446 --> 42:56.779
the only thing worse
for you than going back
to diagnostic medicine

42:58.451 --> 43:00.112
is not going back.

43:10.505 --> 43:12.666
Guess we're gonna find out.
