00:14.723 --> 00:18.101
So, you are not even
playing this video game?

00:18.184 --> 00:21.688
You're just watching these other nerds
playing the video game?

00:23.023 --> 00:24.816
This is the Overwatch League.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.693
It's the world's top e-athletes.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.449
That sounds like a weak-wristed knock.

Come in, Leslie.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.122
Hi, everybody.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.707
Exciting news.

00:40.790 --> 00:42.876
I got two extra tickets to the opera.

00:46.296 --> 00:51.092
Penelope, I was thinking maybe
you and Mateo may want to come.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.553
Thank you so much for the offer,
but I just can't.

00:53.636 --> 00:56.014
I'm completely swamped with disinterest.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.600
Are you sure?

00:58.683 --> 01:00.852
Opera-tunity only knocks once.

01:03.021 --> 01:05.023
Ay, Leslie, no.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.277
Maybe I can take those tickets.

01:09.360 --> 01:12.238
Since when did you
get into the opera, Elena?

01:12.322 --> 01:15.408
Well, I've been looking
for an opera-tunity...

01:15.992 --> 01:19.704
to go out on the town
with my Syd-nificant other.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.915
[Elena and Leslie laugh]

01:21.998 --> 01:24.167

01:25.210 --> 01:26.294
No? Ah.

01:28.838 --> 01:29.964
Hey, Mom, can I go skydiving?

01:30.548 --> 01:31.841
You're right, too dangerous.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.135
I'll just go to the concert
Dylan invited me to instead.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.345
Much safer. Thanks.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.971
Yeah, nice try. Few questions.

01:37.055 --> 01:38.890
What concert is it? Where is it?
Can I come?

01:38.973 --> 01:40.475
Oh, wait. You're not going.

01:41.226 --> 01:45.105
Please, Mom, it's Bud E. Fest,
this really chill outdoor music festival.

01:45.188 --> 01:48.983
No! You could get kidnapped,
trampled, or molested.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.236
You never let me do anything

01:51.319 --> 01:53.238
because you always think
I'm gonna get molested.

01:53.321 --> 01:55.156
And have you ever been molested?

01:56.616 --> 01:57.492
No.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.328
You're welcome.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.831
Sorry, buddy,
but you ain't going to Buddy Fest.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.667
Please, Mom.
There will be tons of security.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.919
Plus, it's outdoors during the day.

02:08.002 --> 02:09.504
It's basically a church picnic.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.258
Look. Come on, I'm 15.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.343
How old were you
when you went to your first concert?

02:15.426 --> 02:17.345
Seventeen. Lisa Lisa.

02:17.428 --> 02:18.930
What are you talking about?

02:19.013 --> 02:21.432
Twenty-three, and we saw Julio Iglesias.

02:21.516 --> 02:22.892
Mami, that's right.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.896
That Lisa Lisa thing
was a crazy dream that I had

02:26.980 --> 02:28.523
that I snuck out to a concert,

02:28.606 --> 02:32.402
but really, I was home that night in bed,
sleeping like two pillows under a blanket.

02:33.945 --> 02:37.198
Well, I would never dream of sneaking out.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.160
That's why I'm asking you.

If you want to go to a concert,
why don't you come with us to the opera?

02:52.088 --> 02:53.840
We have two extra tickets.

of his head, the face will be easy.

He's at a concert I let him go to.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.559
I think I made a terrible mistake.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.105
I remember my first concert in Canada.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.899
Bryan Adams at the Chilliwack Moose Lodge.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.777
Man, that mosh pit was wild.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.905
There was a mosh pit
at a Bryan Adams concert?

04:40.989 --> 04:42.573
Every concert has a mosh pit.

A girlfriend once took me
to see Streisand,

I almost lost an eye during
"You Don't Bring Me Flowers."

Cuban overprotectiveness!

you're going to have to
start trusting Alex.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.219
It's not like you can go everywhere
with him and spy on him.

actually seems pretty safe.

so refined since my day.

at the grooming tent.

but the line was too long.

is nicer than my bathroom.

Well, it did.

05:53.853 --> 05:58.775
Okay, so Alex should be somewhere
in that section over there.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.943
Okay. Here, I brought my binoculars.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.590
Yeah, anyway, I don't need binoculars

06:22.673 --> 06:24.550
because I made Alex wear
a long-sleeve shirt

Wait. Why is he holding a pen?

Maybe he wants to get an autograph.

-No!

Well, I won't be making
that mistake again.

you're allowed to go to a concert,

Well, marijuana has really helped me.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.378
With the pain from your injury?

12:35.379 --> 12:36.672
Sure, we'll say that.

12:38.048 --> 12:40.593
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. Yes, big time.

12:40.676 --> 12:43.012
I mean, a lot of vets I know
were prescribed opiates

12:43.095 --> 12:44.847
and couldn't get off of them.

12:44.930 --> 12:46.056
Yeah, it's a big problem.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.516
Yeah, my ex was one of them.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.059
I smoke weed on occasion.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.603
It's really chilled me out.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.980
What were you like before?

12:58.402 --> 13:00.404
[laughs]

13:01.238 --> 13:04.241
Look, weed is just not my thing.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.286
I mean, I get how it can be helpful
or even kind of fun.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.706
Of course I've tried it,
but Alex can't know that.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.041
He needs to think I'm perfect.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.751
I think you're perfect.

13:18.255 --> 13:20.800
I'm sorry. I'm a little high right now.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.429
Okay, well, we're adults. Alex is 15.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.516
That's true. At that age,
the brain is still developing.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.476
So did you go all Home Depot on him?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.896
Okay, first of all,
that's not a phrase normal people use.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.648
And, no.

13:35.731 --> 13:38.442
It was a one-time thing
and he gets it now.

13:38.526 --> 13:41.237
In fact, I didn't overreact.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.156
I was understanding, but clear and firm.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.158
One and done. Nipped it in the bud.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.035
[laughter]

13:48.118 --> 13:51.247
Oh, no. I wasn't trying to make a bud pun,
but that was funny.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.206
[laughs]

13:52.289 --> 13:55.668
No, we're laughing at how you think
it was Alex's first time.

13:55.751 --> 13:57.753
Yeah, it's cute.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.922
That's what everyone says
when they're teenagers.

14:00.005 --> 14:01.382
"I didn't even like it."

14:03.133 --> 14:04.844
That's what Alex said.

14:04.927 --> 14:05.928
Oh, my god.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.931
-Did you search his room?
-No.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.016
-You've gotta search.
-What's wrong with you?

14:11.100 --> 14:12.309
Okay. Well, I will now.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.854
And if I find any marijuana,
it's going right down the toilet.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.939
Whoa. Let's not be hasty!

14:19.650 --> 14:23.529
Pen, can you take a picture of me
so I can Photoshop myself into the puzzle?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.784
Shh!

14:29.952 --> 14:31.328
What are you doing?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.873
Alex is downstairs
doing punishment laundry,

14:33.956 --> 14:36.500
so I'm secretly searching
his room for drugs.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.546
But the women at the therapy group
got me all worried for nothing.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.048
I went over every inch of this room,
I didn't find anything.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.511
Here you go.

14:52.224 --> 14:53.225
Fake deodorant?

14:53.851 --> 14:56.562
How did you know? You're like
one of those dogs at the airport.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.190
I have a lot of experience hiding drugs.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.152
They used to call me "The Mole."
'Cause of the mole on my butt cheek.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.322
Next to where I hid my drugs.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.658
Let's focus on Alex.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.329
I cannot believe he lied
about it being a one-time thing.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.749
Though I am happy
he doesn't really use Flex body spray.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.793
What the hell is all this stuff?

15:19.877 --> 15:23.631
When I was a kid, you had to roll a joint
or smoke it out of an apple.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.260
We used to make bongs
out of maple syrup jugs.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.182
You could walk down the street toking,
people wouldn't even notice.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.227
They'd just think you were
another hoser your chuggin' syrup.

15:40.856 --> 15:42.775
Do you think Alex has a real drug problem?

15:47.696 --> 15:48.530
No.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.620
Look, there's some left.

15:55.829 --> 15:56.997
That's a good sign.

15:58.248 --> 15:59.124
Trust me.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.545
It's probably just Alex being a teenager.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.299
You'll deal with it.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.803
He's great kid and you're an amazing mom.

16:10.886 --> 16:11.845
Am I?

16:13.430 --> 16:15.015
I kind of feel like I failed.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.727
Look, if it helps,

16:18.811 --> 16:20.771
I know this stuff looks intense, but...

16:22.147 --> 16:25.109
it's actually one of the weakest forms
of marijuana.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.068
Really?

16:26.151 --> 16:27.361
Yeah.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.155
Dr. B's got these lozenges.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.201
He says they go
straight into your bloodstream.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.830
If you're not used to it,
they can really whack you out.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.333
You're fine one moment,

16:41.417 --> 16:42.751
then it kicks in.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.587
Next thing you know,
you're giggling uncontrollably.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.173
-[opera aria playing]
-[snickers]

16:50.092 --> 16:51.802
[guffaws loudly]

16:54.346 --> 16:56.390
It is gay!

16:58.559 --> 17:00.561
[Lydia laughs loudly]

17:01.270 --> 17:02.938
I get it. I get it.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.608
Then you get all paranoid.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.318
[opera aria playing]

17:14.074 --> 17:15.242
[gasps]

17:15.325 --> 17:17.327
The Castros have found me!

17:20.456 --> 17:22.583
One guy I knew
actually popped one at a movie theater

17:22.666 --> 17:24.251
and started talking back to the screen.

17:24.334 --> 17:25.961
Give it up, Titus!

17:27.171 --> 17:30.424
Servilia only wants you as a friend!

17:30.966 --> 17:32.760
Like Leslie and me!

17:34.386 --> 17:35.220
Shh!

17:36.513 --> 17:38.223
Oh, my stars!

17:39.641 --> 17:40.893
[sings operatically]

17:42.436 --> 17:44.897
Thank god no one in my family
is using that stuff.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.457
-Looking for this?
-No! What is that?

18:05.501 --> 18:06.585
Don't even.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.507
This is what you're doing?

18:11.590 --> 18:14.760
I'm busting my ass for this family,
and you're out there doing this crap?

18:15.844 --> 18:18.847
-I'm sorry, I--
-You lied right to my face.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.474
I had to.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.559
If I didn't lie, you would've said
I couldn't do it.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.437
'Cause you shouldn't do it!

18:25.521 --> 18:27.314
It's not that bad.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.483
-It's legal now.
-Yeah. You know what else is legal?

18:30.150 --> 18:32.611
Smoking, drinking, gambling.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.155
But you end up with cancer, cirrhosis,

18:35.239 --> 18:37.741
and prying your abuelita
off the penny slots.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.831
And none of those things
are legal for you 'cause you're 15.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.459
It's just a fun thing
we do once in awhile.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.628
Anyways, I get straight As.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.338
You want for long if you're a stoner.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.714
I'm not a stoner.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.383
We laugh at those guys.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.803
Besides, tons of successful people
have smoked weed.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.764
Barack Obama, Steve Jobs, Oprah.

19:00.848 --> 19:04.601
Unemployed, dead,
and Gayle just said that to get ratings.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.192
And trust me, for every success,

19:12.276 --> 19:15.529
there are a hundred losers
whose lives never go anywhere.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.865
And you really think it's healthy for you?

19:18.574 --> 19:20.742
You know that guy
at the concert, Willie Nelson?

19:20.826 --> 19:22.202
Thirty-two years old.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.455
No, he's not. He's like your age.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.958
No, he's not like my age!
He's a lot older than me!

19:30.419 --> 19:31.461
[Penelope sighs]

19:36.633 --> 19:38.135
I am so disappointed in you.

19:40.095 --> 19:42.181
You're a good kid, you're a smart kid,

19:42.848 --> 19:44.224
and you should know better.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.729
I'm sorry I'm not perfect like you.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.483
Trust me, I'm not perfect.

19:56.236 --> 19:58.655
I tried pot a couple of times.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.240
You did?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.617
Yeah, I was stupid too.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.369
So, I get the curiosity.

20:06.663 --> 20:09.708
But when you're a kid,
it messes with your brain

20:09.791 --> 20:11.335
because it's still developing.

20:13.754 --> 20:16.798
And you need to be especially careful
because you're Latino.

20:18.133 --> 20:18.967
Why?

20:22.262 --> 20:23.388
When I was 17,

20:24.348 --> 20:27.267
a cop caught me and my friend
smoking pot at the beach.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.395
I got dragged into the police station.

20:31.230 --> 20:33.398
But my friend, Caroline, who was white,

20:33.941 --> 20:36.610
and I'm talking sunburn-at-night white,

20:39.738 --> 20:41.365
the cop let her go with a warning.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.034
You got arrested?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.787
Oh, my god. Abuelita must've freaked.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.121
[scoffs] She don't know.

20:51.041 --> 20:55.379
Luckily, there was a Latino cop
working the desk who felt sorry for me

20:55.462 --> 20:57.506
and let me go, but not before he said,

20:58.632 --> 21:01.176
"You can't be doing this kind of stuff.

21:02.052 --> 21:03.428
It's different for us."

21:05.639 --> 21:06.682
He was right.

21:08.433 --> 21:13.063
So the reality is, if a white kid
like Dylan gets caught with a little weed,

21:13.146 --> 21:14.690
he gets a cool story.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.359
But you?

21:19.444 --> 21:20.821
You could end up in prison.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.866
Your life will be over,

21:26.326 --> 21:29.496
and so will mine because I couldn't
bear to lose you like that.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.377
I'm sorry, Mami.

21:37.045 --> 21:38.297
I'll never do it again.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.592
Oh.

21:43.218 --> 21:45.178
I would love to believe you.

21:47.848 --> 21:49.141
But one of these days,

21:49.224 --> 21:50.851
I'm gonna make you use this.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.894
A pregnancy test?

21:55.022 --> 21:56.732
No, it's a drug test,

21:56.815 --> 22:00.027
but now I'm concerned that you know
what a pregnancy test looks like.

22:01.820 --> 22:02.904
You know what? Another day.

22:04.906 --> 22:06.533
Anyway, this is gonna happen,

22:06.616 --> 22:09.077
and your pee better be freaking perfect.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.164
It will be, I swear.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.462
[sniffs] Mmm.

22:18.545 --> 22:21.048
You are using Flex body spray.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.926
How many times in one day
are you gonna disappoint me?

22:27.721 --> 22:31.224
And did you know that smoking marijuana
can also cause gynecomastia?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.852
-What is that?
-That's when men grow boobs.

22:35.437 --> 22:37.230
Why didn't you just lead with that?!

22:40.233 --> 22:43.153
We could've skipped
the rest of the conversation!

22:45.155 --> 22:46.073
[whimpers]

22:48.241 --> 22:49.826
I think we caught it in time.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.080
And one more thing.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.374
Please don't tell Abuelita what I did.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.292
I don't want to disappoint her too.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.419
Baby, I would never do that.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.338
I don't need that in my life.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.758
If she asks why you're grounded,

23:04.841 --> 23:07.177
we'll just say you're being punished

23:07.260 --> 23:09.805
for spending time with a girl
who's a bad influence.

23:09.888 --> 23:10.722
"Mary Jane."

23:12.599 --> 23:14.851
I get it. Like Peter Parker's girlfriend.

23:18.522 --> 23:19.398
No, it's...

23:20.732 --> 23:21.608
Forget it.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.903
Oh, wait. You got to keep
my pot story a secret too

23:24.986 --> 23:26.655
'cause Abuelita would never understand.

23:32.953 --> 23:35.455
So, we got banned from the opera.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.792
[theme music plays]
