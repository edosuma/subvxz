WEBVTT

00:04.263 --> 00:07.899
...it's life and death, but once you
leave, it all becomes nice memories.

00:07.933 --> 00:10.301
I guess you can't be nostalgic for
something you've never loved.

00:10.336 --> 00:12.637
<i>Evan and Cappie got into a fight that
night that ended their friendship.</i>

00:12.671 --> 00:14.405
We were all friends again,
why'd you have to screw it up?

00:14.440 --> 00:16.074
Hey, you screwed it up!

00:16.108 --> 00:17.542
<i>Why are Cappie and Evan</i>
<i>still fighting?</i>

00:17.576 --> 00:19.043
Because of you.
They both fell for the same girl.

00:24.467 --> 00:26.298
Picking something I hate
just to pick.

00:26.299 --> 00:28.033
Welcome, truthseekers.
Why are we here?

00:28.067 --> 00:30.268
<i>There's nothing</i>
<i>happening between us.</i>

00:30.302 --> 00:34.239
So if I did anything to make you think
otherwise, then I'm really, really sorry.

00:34.273 --> 00:37.442
<i>She's not going to declare
our house a historical landmark.</i>

00:37.476 --> 00:39.411
It either has to be fixed up
or it'll have to be torn down.

00:39.445 --> 00:41.212
- Lasker's buying the house.
- We're saved!

00:41.247 --> 00:43.648
The attacks on KT, it
all started rush night, right?

00:43.683 --> 00:46.718
Maybe young Mr. Parkes
is our Villain X.

00:46.752 --> 00:48.987
- What's that?
- It's nothing.

00:49.021 --> 00:52.424
Our house was built
in the Spring of 1916

00:52.458 --> 00:54.159
and originally held 20 members

00:54.193 --> 00:56.895
and cost $36,000 to construct.

00:56.929 --> 00:59.764
It has seen over 15 changes
to its structure,

00:59.799 --> 01:02.000
twelve of which were
intentional.

01:02.034 --> 01:04.968
And now it's about to see
its most extensive one to date.

01:05.004 --> 01:10.742
Yep, thanks to my dad,
Mr. Saving the Day... Man.

01:10.776 --> 01:13.244
I need to work on my insults.

01:13.279 --> 01:15.146
Hey, Cap.
Good luck on your finals!

01:15.181 --> 01:17.182
Gee, thanks, Peter!

01:21.220 --> 01:22.787
I don't trust that kid.

01:22.822 --> 01:24.956
And it's not just because
of his shifty eyes.

01:24.990 --> 01:27.459
Well it's a little bit
his shifty eyes.

01:27.493 --> 01:29.194
I really don't think
Peter is Villain X.

01:29.228 --> 01:30.595
He just has family issues.

01:30.629 --> 01:31.963
And shifty eyes.

01:31.997 --> 01:34.666
Regardless, we have
more pressing matters.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.301
We have to be out of here
by tomorrow night

01:36.335 --> 01:38.303
so Lasker's guys
can start the renovations.

01:38.337 --> 01:40.004
And get our house GPA
up to a 2.0.

01:40.039 --> 01:41.639
Which is something I want
to talk to you about.

01:41.674 --> 01:43.274
I have one more final left.

01:43.309 --> 01:46.077
Well, it's not so much
a final as it is a

01:46.112 --> 01:49.514
philosophical rumination and
oration on life and the history of

01:49.548 --> 01:50.849
the universal perception.

01:51.951 --> 01:53.284
How do we not have a 2.0?

01:53.319 --> 01:55.019
And since you're done
with your finals,

01:55.054 --> 01:57.455
I was thinking maybe while I'm
preparing to orate,

01:57.490 --> 02:00.058
you could be
substitute president.

02:00.092 --> 02:03.294
We have a lot to do around here,
I could really use the help.

02:04.697 --> 02:06.698
- Yes, Yeah, Yes.
- Yeah?

02:06.732 --> 02:11.536
President Russell Alan
Cartwright. Substitute.

02:17.009 --> 02:18.076
Hey, Case.

02:19.411 --> 02:20.545
What's up with your arm?

02:20.579 --> 02:22.080
Nothing.

02:22.114 --> 02:24.883
Look at this, I found
an article on the razing

02:24.917 --> 02:26.751
of a historic pre-World War I
building.

02:26.786 --> 02:28.353
I know Segal's
going to want that.

02:28.387 --> 02:30.355
- Evan.
- Yeah?

02:30.389 --> 02:33.992
I'm sorry he asked me to be his
research assistant and not you.

02:34.026 --> 02:36.494
OK, well, he wants me
to help too.

02:36.529 --> 02:39.297
He's telling the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, Miss Cartwright.

02:39.331 --> 02:40.865
I need you both.
What happened to your arm?

02:40.900 --> 02:42.000
Oh, it's nothing.

02:42.034 --> 02:43.668
- Uh-huh.
- What's going on?

02:43.702 --> 02:45.703
Well, the university
has been developing

02:45.738 --> 02:47.705
some expansion plans
for some time now

02:47.740 --> 02:51.509
and they want to break ground as early as
next semester on a new athletic center.

02:51.544 --> 02:54.479
Are they expanding
into a puppy shop?

02:54.513 --> 02:57.081
Sort of. See, your mock trial
case was never that mock.

02:57.116 --> 03:01.619
CRU is acquiring some properties,
a few vacated residences

03:01.654 --> 03:05.690
and a blighted fraternity house, which
they plan to tear down in two days.

03:05.724 --> 03:08.593
- A blighted fraternity house?
- Yeah, Lambda Sigma.

03:08.627 --> 03:10.128
Oh, thank God.

03:10.162 --> 03:12.564
Wait, nope, that's the safe
one. It's Kappa Tau Gamma.

03:12.598 --> 03:13.965
- What?
- Uh...

03:13.999 --> 03:16.768
I think what she means is,
what would you like us to do?

03:16.802 --> 03:20.038
You're both so good forecasting
opposing strategy during the mock trial,

03:20.072 --> 03:23.241
I want you to put yourselves
in this fraternity's shoes.

03:23.275 --> 03:26.110
Think about what they might try
to pull to prevent the university

03:26.145 --> 03:27.445
from tearing their house down.

03:27.479 --> 03:32.183
But, Professor Segal, that is
my boyfriend's fraternity.

03:32.218 --> 03:35.453
And my brother's.
I don't think I can do this.

03:35.487 --> 03:37.121
Don't think you can
do your job?

03:37.156 --> 03:39.958
How do you think your colleagues and
future professors are going to react

03:39.992 --> 03:43.261
to you no longer being my assistant
because of your boyfriend's fraternity?

03:43.295 --> 03:44.262
You'd fire me?

03:44.296 --> 03:46.097
The choice is yours.

03:46.131 --> 03:49.167
This is important to
the university and to me.

03:49.201 --> 03:52.604
If you want to be successful, it needs
to be important to you too. Both of you.

03:57.254 --> 04:04.163
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:07.180 --> 04:08.914
OK, you know what?
This is insane.

04:08.948 --> 04:12.718
I mean, we can't be a part of the research
team that destroys Kappa Tau, right?

04:12.752 --> 04:16.688
Why not? I mean, look, it sounds like it's
going to happen with or without us, right?

04:16.723 --> 04:18.524
And KT's a sinking
ship, it's inevitable.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.759
OK, but KT means
so much to Cappie.

04:20.793 --> 04:21.994
Not to mention Rusty.

04:22.028 --> 04:25.164
OK, well, how much does
your future mean to you?

04:25.198 --> 04:28.734
But they'd never forgive me.
I'm going to tell them.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.336
All right, well do what you
want. Just lea6e me out of it.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.405
Come on, Evan. There isn't there
some small part of you

04:33.439 --> 04:35.174
that still cares about Cappie?

04:35.208 --> 04:37.476
Why can't you just let it go?

04:41.414 --> 04:43.482
Because I'm not interested
in pissing off Segal,

04:43.516 --> 04:45.617
or the university
for some stupid fraternity.

04:45.652 --> 04:48.287
You pledged that
stupid fraternity.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.522
Yeah, and that was in the past.

04:50.557 --> 04:54.193
Since when did Casey Cartwright
stop thinking about her future?

04:59.265 --> 05:02.868
<i>Peter mentioned his dad was investing
in more land around the KT house.</i>

05:02.902 --> 05:05.504
Now why would Lasker Parkes
Incorporated buy up all these lots?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.739
Maybe it's not just renovation,
but expansion.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.274
Maybe you guys
are getting a pool!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.009
Hey, working girl.

05:11.044 --> 05:12.911
Hello, boys.
Sorry I can't dawdle,

05:12.946 --> 05:15.948
but Clarissa and I are
checking out our new offices,

05:15.982 --> 05:18.417
so I better start my commute,
maybe get a latte on the way

05:18.451 --> 05:20.285
in my on-the-go to-go mug.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.020
Well, I'm psyched for you.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.389
Thanks. It feels good. I was
kinda adrift there for a while.

05:24.424 --> 05:27.359
Me, too. But... hey, big news.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.794
I've finally
picked out a major.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.861
- What is it?
- Really?

05:29.896 --> 05:31.863
Yeah. Uh, accounting!

05:32.398 --> 05:33.365
Oh.

05:33.399 --> 05:34.466
Oh.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.035
No, it's good.
It's practical, you know?

05:37.070 --> 05:39.938
The business sector is robust.
Not recession-proof but...

05:39.973 --> 05:41.907
And you love it. Right?

05:41.941 --> 05:46.345
Yeah, I mean, yeah, you know,
I will. I do.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.580
- Yeah!
- OK. So, yay!

05:48.615 --> 05:52.050
Ashleigh, before you leave,
I got you a little something.

05:53.486 --> 05:57.189
It's for your office,
so everybody knows your name.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.761
You hate it?

06:02.795 --> 06:05.197
No, I love it.
It's just so...

06:06.332 --> 06:08.467
...grown-up serious.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.473
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.145
- OK, bye.
- Bye.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.348
You still like her.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.617
I like giving her presents.
Big deal.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.352
Oh my gosh, wait,

06:27.387 --> 06:30.656
you gave her that taxicab not-rape whistle
when she went to New York, right?

06:30.690 --> 06:32.624
How long have you had
these feelings for Ashleigh?

06:32.659 --> 06:35.827
Well, it doesn't matter 'cause
nothing's ever gonna happen.

06:35.862 --> 06:37.629
I'm sorry, man.

06:37.664 --> 06:40.299
Whatever. It's just...
you know, it's stupid.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.100
I'm stupid.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.404
To even think...
whoa, wait, oh my God.

06:45.438 --> 06:47.406
- What?
- I don't think KT's getting a pool.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.610
Vince lavaliered Betsy
last night!

06:51.644 --> 06:52.878
He hid it in her chili dog!

06:52.912 --> 06:55.847
I almost choked and died.
It was so worth it!

06:55.882 --> 06:58.216
What a waste of
a perfectly good chili dog.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.252
Hey!

07:00.286 --> 07:01.386
Happy couples make me sick.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.654
True dat.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.790
My second cousin Barry
got married last weekend.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.525
He hadn't left the house
in five years.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.393
So why am I hard up right now?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.395
If he can find
Mrs. Barry Kettlewell...

07:10.430 --> 07:13.165
Well, look at me.
An extremely hot ZBZ president,

07:13.199 --> 07:14.566
and I'm totally dateless.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.769
I couldn't make it last with
Cappie or Evan. Or a girl.

07:17.804 --> 07:18.937
Girls aren't any easier.

07:18.971 --> 07:20.972
I've been dumped
by a landlord and Laura.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.942
You don't think we're
the problem, do you?

07:23.976 --> 07:27.112
Hey. Remember that terrible
Matthew McConaughey film?

07:27.146 --> 07:31.016
<i>Sahara</i> ? <i>Ed TV</i> ?
<i>The Wedding Planner</i> ?

07:31.050 --> 07:34.353
<i>Failure to Launch</i> ?
<i>How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days</i> ?

07:34.387 --> 07:37.522
- <i>Fool's Gold</i> ?
- No.

07:37.557 --> 07:39.091
<i>Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.</i>

07:39.125 --> 07:41.493
He revisited his exes
and learned what went wrong.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.261
Forget it.

07:51.437 --> 07:54.206
Fine.

07:56.000 --> 08:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:03.349 --> 08:04.983
Ooh!

08:05.017 --> 08:07.052
Oh Crap! Hey, sorry.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.921
Better tell Lasker we're
gonna need a new TV.

08:09.956 --> 08:12.457
Hey, Cap, I got really bad news.

08:12.492 --> 08:13.725
You broke the flat screen?

08:13.793 --> 08:15.327
Plug that in,
it might still work.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.764
- Oh!
- Sorry.

08:19.866 --> 08:22.334
This is gonna be
the easiest move ever.

08:22.368 --> 08:23.835
OK, um...

08:23.870 --> 08:25.771
Hey, guys, I have
really bad news.

08:25.805 --> 08:28.073
- You broke the bottle tank?
- Well my news is a lot worse.

08:28.107 --> 08:30.776
Trust me it pales in comparison
to what I'm going to say to you.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.544
- You can't just walk in here...
- Do not shoot the messenger...

08:33.578 --> 08:35.013
Kids!

08:35.047 --> 08:36.914
This is why daddy drinks.

08:36.948 --> 08:39.885
OK, I was researching Lasker
Parkes Incorporated

08:39.919 --> 08:43.188
and I found some geological
surveys of our area

08:43.222 --> 08:45.223
and I think he's buying up
land around us

08:45.258 --> 08:47.426
because we're sitting on oil.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.294
Lasker Parkes
is buying up land?

08:49.328 --> 08:51.963
- For oil.
- No, it's not for oil.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.034
He's donating the land to the university,
because they want to build an athletic center.

08:56.068 --> 08:59.938
And... they're going to tear
down your house to do it.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.139
They're going to tear us down?

09:01.841 --> 09:03.775
- Lasker?
- Yeah.

09:03.810 --> 09:07.546
Well, he... He knew about
our secret rush party,

09:07.580 --> 09:08.980
and our fake philanthropy.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.950
Hell, he created Joshua Whopper.

09:11.984 --> 09:16.621
- Lasker is Villain X.
- Are you sure about this?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.825
Segal put Evan and me on the
university's legal research team.

09:19.859 --> 09:23.995
Oh. Well, are you staying on?

09:24.030 --> 09:28.099
Cap, this is my future.
It's just research.

09:28.134 --> 09:31.536
Research that they're using to
help tear down our house.

09:31.571 --> 09:34.873
I'm so sorry. I...

09:34.907 --> 09:38.143
I get it. I'll handle
our side of things.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.983
Hey, what are you going to do,
Spitter?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.718
- Good one, Cap.
- No, I'm serious.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.988
I have my philosophy final to worry about
and you're acting president, so...

09:50.022 --> 09:53.158
So what? First of all, it's
an oration, it's not a final.

09:53.192 --> 09:55.093
Second, since when
do you care about grades?

09:55.127 --> 09:57.829
I'm gonna worry about
the house GPA, I'm the nerd.

09:57.864 --> 10:00.732
But you've been wanting to take the reigns
since the beginning of the semester.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.969
But this isn't saving parties
or stealing goats.

10:04.003 --> 10:06.705
If we lose our house, Nationals
said they'll shut us down.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.941
You're the president.
You are KT.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.377
You're the only one
who can do this.

10:12.411 --> 10:13.712
Cap...

10:17.783 --> 10:20.218
Well, I guess I'm the only one.

10:24.497 --> 10:27.232
We should get,
like a million balloons,

10:27.266 --> 10:29.801
and tie them to the house,
and move it.

10:29.835 --> 10:31.303
I think I saw it on <i>20/20</i> once.

10:31.337 --> 10:33.338
Yeah, I saw that episode.
It totally worked.

10:33.372 --> 10:36.308
What did old <i>90210</i> do
to save the Peach Pit?

10:37.643 --> 10:40.312
Maybe we should try something
a little more in the box.

10:40.346 --> 10:43.014
The house is a box...

10:51.223 --> 10:54.893
I'm so sorry, guys.
I had no idea. I swear.

10:54.927 --> 10:58.830
We believe you. Right, Cap?

10:58.864 --> 11:02.000
You can't blame Luke Skywalker
for being Darth Vader's son.

11:02.034 --> 11:05.203
- Spoiler alert.
- Hey, maybe you can talk to your dad?

11:05.237 --> 11:06.204
Change his mind?

11:06.238 --> 11:08.840
About business? No way.

11:08.874 --> 11:11.876
I don't get it. All I heard growing
up was how awesome KT was.

11:11.911 --> 11:13.545
Clearly, he doesn't
feel that way anymore.

11:13.579 --> 11:17.415
That's it! What if Lasker Parkes
forgot what it's like to be a KT?

11:17.450 --> 11:19.584
Yeah, like, he has
amnesia or something.

11:19.618 --> 11:23.388
Maybe he hit his head a long time ago, and
we just need to hit him on the head again!

11:23.422 --> 11:26.291
Or... maybe he just forgot
what brotherhood means.

11:26.325 --> 11:28.860
And we need to remind him.

11:28.894 --> 11:31.029
Nostalgia is a powerful thing.

11:31.063 --> 11:33.898
So, did your dad keep
any of his old KT stuff?

11:33.933 --> 11:36.568
Pictures, pledge paddles...
inflatable dolls?

11:36.602 --> 11:38.870
The only fraternity stuff of his
I've ever seen are in his office.

11:38.904 --> 11:41.573
- We're going to need 'em.
- I can't go in without him noticing.

11:41.607 --> 11:42.841
There's serious security.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.809
Corporate spying,
tech theft's a big issue.

11:44.844 --> 11:47.545
Well, it's about to
get even bigger...

11:47.580 --> 11:50.615
Pledge Spidey, bring
me the action figures...

11:50.649 --> 11:53.084
...and the Barbies, too!

11:53.119 --> 11:54.786
We're gonna need 'em all.

11:57.189 --> 11:58.857
After you.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.260
Not bad.

12:02.294 --> 12:06.798
Yeah, it looks like all fun and games...
bought with blood money.

12:06.832 --> 12:08.633
Relax. Nobody's dying.

12:08.667 --> 12:12.737
And how would you feel if it was the Omega
Chi house being torn down, Evan Bacon?

12:12.772 --> 12:14.139
What?

12:14.173 --> 12:17.142
It's like Kevin Bacon, but like
Ev... you know how... Yeah.

12:17.176 --> 12:18.543
My two star pupils.

12:18.577 --> 12:21.646
- A pleasure to meet you both.
- We are ready to get to work.

12:21.680 --> 12:24.849
Have you had lunch?
I thought we'd hit one of our organic cafes.

12:24.884 --> 12:26.751
Ooh. Sorry about your arm.
What happened?

12:26.786 --> 12:28.853
- Ah, nothing.
- This way.

12:28.888 --> 12:31.790
Welcome to Laskerplex.

12:31.824 --> 12:37.328
This enchanting world of productivity
and technological advancement...

12:42.101 --> 12:43.835
Oh, you know who should work
here? Rusty!

12:43.869 --> 12:47.071
Ah, you know who should move out
of his apartment? You.

12:47.106 --> 12:49.174
He really likes you. He has
apparently for some time.

12:49.208 --> 12:50.842
Yeah, well, I like him too.

12:50.876 --> 12:52.744
Then why don't you just go
out with him?

12:52.778 --> 12:55.814
Casey made me promise that I
wouldn't unless I was a 100% sure.

12:55.848 --> 12:57.449
Maybe I'm just gonna hurt him.

12:57.483 --> 12:59.651
Being in his life so much
might be hurting him more.

12:59.685 --> 13:01.586
Happy to be at Laskey.

13:01.620 --> 13:02.854
Woo-woo!

13:02.888 --> 13:05.890
With over 300 beanbags
company-wide.

13:05.925 --> 13:08.726
- I gotta go to the bathroom.
- I have to go, too.

13:09.762 --> 13:11.029
We'll just wait here.

13:12.531 --> 13:15.667
Do not go in there. Somebody's
got IBS and real bad aim.

13:21.273 --> 13:24.375
I'm afraid you'll have to hold
it 'til we reach the lap pools.

13:24.410 --> 13:26.544
- It's lady business.
- I might explode.

13:27.913 --> 13:30.181
Fine, the executive wing is
this way.

13:30.216 --> 13:32.550
You'll find the restroom
on your left.

13:32.585 --> 13:34.719
Don't talk.
Or make eye contact.

13:34.753 --> 13:38.423
Please be a sweetie
and wipe the seatie.

13:38.457 --> 13:42.594
Have I told you about our
house rabbit adoption center?

13:50.002 --> 13:53.271
This coffee is so good, but
how do you know that it's organic?

13:53.305 --> 13:55.340
Well, I picked these beans
myself.

13:55.374 --> 13:56.841
Oh!

13:56.876 --> 14:01.179
It's just, how do
you find the time?

14:01.213 --> 14:04.315
- That was a joke.
- It's a joke.

14:09.154 --> 14:12.056
- Ready to save the day?
- I think Cappie is the hero here.

14:12.091 --> 14:13.625
You could've handled all this,
Rus.

14:13.659 --> 14:16.027
I don't see why you
gave up the presidency.

14:17.963 --> 14:21.266
Hey, If I get caught with this ID, your
dad's going to be pretty pissed at you.

14:21.300 --> 14:23.968
- You sure you're good with that?
- It's my house too.

14:33.812 --> 14:36.214
- Uh, could you take o picture?
- Oh, of course, sir.

14:36.248 --> 14:38.550
- Photos aren't allowed.
- Thanks.

14:38.584 --> 14:40.552
Oh, wow.

14:40.586 --> 14:43.521
Perfect.

14:43.556 --> 14:45.557
Lost a contact. Sorry.

14:47.726 --> 14:49.961
Is that the same girl
that you went in there with?

14:49.995 --> 14:53.097
- Of course she is.
- What?

14:53.132 --> 14:55.733
That's definitely the same girl
whom I've never met before.

14:58.103 --> 15:00.071
Quickly this way people.

15:00.105 --> 15:02.774
Like baby birds.
I'm the momma let's do this.

15:02.808 --> 15:06.311
I'm totally serious. I was told Mr. Parkes
is screaming for you in Conference Room Fauna.

15:06.345 --> 15:08.313
And I'm supposed to
cover your phones.

15:08.347 --> 15:10.748
Not again.
I'll be right back.

15:16.155 --> 15:18.823
- Well done.
- Oh, Thanks. Go, I'll sit guard.

15:29.835 --> 15:31.569
Well, It should be smooth
sailing, Mr. Parkes.

15:31.604 --> 15:34.138
You own the property, you have
all the necessary permits.

15:34.173 --> 15:35.340
The law's completely
on your side.

15:35.374 --> 15:38.076
But I'm more concerned
about unlawful activists.

15:38.110 --> 15:40.278
<i>What are we up against?</i>

15:40.312 --> 15:45.583
Knowing KT, they'll probably try tying a million
balloons to the house and float it away.

15:45.618 --> 15:48.386
What about you, Miss
Cartwright? What do you think?

15:48.420 --> 15:53.758
Well, I'd imagine there will be
some kind of protest rally.

15:53.792 --> 15:56.861
They could contact the school
paper, or local news stations.

15:56.895 --> 16:01.299
However, per Rardin v. O'Toole,
they'd be trespassing.

16:01.333 --> 16:04.936
You know you own that land, you
could have them forcibly removed.

16:04.970 --> 16:07.939
Sorry, my assistant is not
at her desk, which is strange.

16:07.973 --> 16:11.309
And a little unacceptable. I'm gonna
run up to the office. Excuse me, guys.

16:15.914 --> 16:18.549
God, he's going to
be up here any second.

16:20.486 --> 16:22.587
- Bingo.
- Yes!

16:23.956 --> 16:25.423
Hillary?

16:25.457 --> 16:26.691
Oh my God, go!

16:32.765 --> 16:35.833
Yeah, It's Lasker, where is my
assistant? Lasker.

16:35.868 --> 16:39.504
Lasker Parkes,
how many Lasker's are there?

16:45.426 --> 16:47.327
They're like robots,
or Terminators,

16:47.361 --> 16:51.631
sent from the future to destroy
our house without any remorse.

16:51.666 --> 16:53.867
- I'm one of 'they'.
- But you are 'you',

16:53.901 --> 16:56.369
Even though you're part of
'they', they're the 'they'.

16:56.404 --> 16:57.704
I hate helping 'they'.

16:57.738 --> 16:59.839
Well, you're pretty good at it.
Maybe a little too good.

16:59.874 --> 17:01.574
I don't want to be good at
something like this,

17:01.609 --> 17:03.610
that I don't agree with
or believe in.

17:03.644 --> 17:06.913
I know how much
the house means to you.

17:09.884 --> 17:11.951
There's something else
we need to talk about.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.655
What's this?

17:15.690 --> 17:18.223
Over the past five years I took
so many different classes

17:18.259 --> 17:22.127
and had so many different
majors. I kinda lost track.

17:22.163 --> 17:26.031
And, this letter explains
that, um...

17:26.067 --> 17:28.902
...I can graduate.

17:28.936 --> 17:31.204
This semester.

17:31.238 --> 17:36.943
You accidentally graduated?
That's great!

17:38.212 --> 17:39.546
Or is it?

17:39.580 --> 17:44.150
Well, I was waiting to surprise
you, and to see if I passed

17:44.218 --> 17:46.319
but now, I'm not so sure
if I can.

17:47.354 --> 17:48.788
Because of the fraternity.

17:48.823 --> 17:50.924
I thought Rusty could
take over. I don't get it.

17:50.958 --> 17:52.559
- I think he's scared.
- So am I,

17:52.593 --> 17:54.694
but that's not going to save KT.

17:54.729 --> 17:58.164
I mean, that house...
it's kinda where I grew up.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.800
You have grown-up.

18:02.103 --> 18:04.337
Right now I feel like the only
person who can save it.

18:05.906 --> 18:07.373
If I go, so does Kappa Tau.

18:10.211 --> 18:14.080
It's funny. I've spent
most of college

18:14.115 --> 18:16.816
feeling like the KT house
was the 'other woman',

18:16.851 --> 18:19.352
knowing I'd have to share you.

18:19.386 --> 18:22.889
If this doesn't work out
tomorrow...

18:22.923 --> 18:24.958
...tonight's her last night.

18:25.726 --> 18:26.726
I get it.

18:29.463 --> 18:30.463
Go to her.

18:38.706 --> 18:41.107
Thank you.

18:44.545 --> 18:46.746
So, I got an e-mail from Robin.

18:46.781 --> 18:49.182
She claims we didn't work out
because I'm not a lesbian.

18:49.216 --> 18:51.518
Despite your masculine energy.

18:51.552 --> 18:54.521
Which leaves me with Cappie,
who's way busy with Kappa Tau.

18:54.555 --> 18:56.456
And Evan, who I'm
saving for last.

18:56.490 --> 18:58.691
Kind of dreading that one.

18:58.726 --> 19:01.227
Yeah, I'm saving Laura for last.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.836
Or you could rip off the
Band-Aid.

19:10.604 --> 19:13.339
OK. All right here we go.

19:13.374 --> 19:15.575
- A little privacy?
- Right.

19:15.609 --> 19:17.911
Ladies, could you excuse us?

19:22.416 --> 19:25.285
OK.

19:26.287 --> 19:27.420
What?

19:28.255 --> 19:30.156
Why didn't we ever work out?

19:30.191 --> 19:32.358
You don't like to sweat.

19:32.393 --> 19:37.430
No, I mean...
like our relationship.

19:40.534 --> 19:42.101
Did we even have a relationship?

19:43.137 --> 19:47.540
- Never mind.
- Because I wish we did.

19:49.009 --> 19:50.009
You do?

19:53.214 --> 19:55.415
Oh, come on!

20:19.940 --> 20:21.541
Spitter?

20:25.713 --> 20:27.380
What are you doing here?

20:27.414 --> 20:29.616
Probably the same
thing you are.

20:34.255 --> 20:38.625
So I'm guessing you'll confront Lasker
tomorrow morning, at the protest.

20:41.528 --> 20:44.497
You know, I'm not very proud
of the way that I backed out

20:44.531 --> 20:46.733
as interim president.

20:46.767 --> 20:50.370
I thought you wanted
to lead the house.

20:50.404 --> 20:54.073
When I came to CRU, I didn't
know how to have fun.

20:54.108 --> 20:59.946
Having Kappa Tau in my life
changed all that.

21:02.349 --> 21:05.218
But without it, I'm just gonna
go back to being same old

21:05.252 --> 21:09.289
nerdy Crusty Cartwright.

21:09.323 --> 21:13.660
This house is way too important
for me to take over.

21:17.298 --> 21:19.532
It's a good thing we're not
going to lose it then.

21:26.240 --> 21:27.807
Guys?

21:35.616 --> 21:38.284
We just thought it'd be fun to
get trashed here one more time.

21:38.319 --> 21:41.888
One last round.

22:02.109 --> 22:04.243
So, is this it?

22:06.947 --> 22:09.649
We're coming to you live
from Cyprus-Rhodes University's

22:09.683 --> 22:13.987
infamous Greek row, where a student
rally is taking place to save...

22:15.622 --> 22:19.859
I'm disgusted by what they're trying
to do to you guys, Mr. Cappie.

22:19.893 --> 22:21.327
Back up, knucklehead!

22:22.296 --> 22:24.464
- Wade!
- What are you doing here?

22:24.498 --> 22:25.865
KT forever!

22:25.899 --> 22:28.301
And my parents finally kicked me
out of their basement,

22:28.335 --> 22:31.204
so I'm looking for a place
to crash for a few weeks.

22:31.238 --> 22:33.139
- So let's save this house!
- You got it, bud.

22:33.173 --> 22:37.243
- So good to see you, buddy.
- Yeah, you too!

22:37.277 --> 22:39.145
Whoa, check, here we go.

22:39.179 --> 22:43.016
Hi, I'm Cappie.
President of Kappa Tau Gamma.

22:47.921 --> 22:51.457
I just want to thank
every one of you for coming out

22:51.492 --> 22:55.094
to support the preservation
of our beloved home.

22:59.400 --> 23:04.237
Now this house is a time
capsule for many, many...

23:04.271 --> 23:07.774
...many parties and personal
college stories.

23:07.808 --> 23:10.710
Now, does anyone want to share
a KT story with us?

23:14.014 --> 23:15.982
- Great, thank you.
- All right.

23:16.016 --> 23:20.686
Hi, my name is Katherine Parker, I am former
Pan-Hellenic President and Gamma Psi alum.

23:20.721 --> 23:23.589
Thank you. Thank you.

23:23.624 --> 23:28.294
This house is especially important to me
because this is where I lost my virginity.

23:32.633 --> 23:34.767
It was like two months ago!

23:36.170 --> 23:40.106
So, how many of you guys lost
your virginity at this house?

23:41.942 --> 23:44.143
Ok.

23:44.178 --> 23:45.745
Does it matter which virginity
you lost?

23:45.779 --> 23:48.581
Anyone else? Yes?

23:49.550 --> 23:50.917
- Lisa Lawson.
- Hi.

23:50.951 --> 23:54.053
OK. And how many of you
lost it to me?

23:57.524 --> 23:59.025
Oh, my word.

24:00.194 --> 24:02.795
- Ok.
- Thanks. Anyone else?

24:02.830 --> 24:05.598
Oh all right, yes.

24:05.632 --> 24:10.002
Hi. I'm Jennifer Kenney, Editor in Chief of
the <i>Cyprus-Rhodes Courier.</i>

24:10.037 --> 24:12.271
Oh, you'll be happy to know
I took your advice.

24:12.306 --> 24:15.141
Finally. Wow, Rus
is a really lucky guy.

24:15.175 --> 24:17.844
Oh no, not that advice.
The moving out part.

24:17.878 --> 24:20.446
I put down a deposit on an
apartment last night.

24:20.481 --> 24:22.949
Oh, taking the safe road.

24:22.983 --> 24:25.485
Uh, you should know.
Accounting.

24:25.519 --> 24:29.355
When I was a freshman, I wrote
a scathing yet award-winning

24:29.389 --> 24:32.258
indictment on the Greek system
that I have now come to regret.

24:32.292 --> 24:37.096
In my article, I attacked the common practices
of this two- century-old tradition.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.401
Hey, everyone. My name
is Lasker Parkes,

24:42.436 --> 24:46.372
and I guess you could say I'm the
one responsible for all this.

24:49.376 --> 24:51.377
All right, all right.

24:56.350 --> 24:58.918
All children grow up.

25:05.559 --> 25:10.196
Dad, please don't do this.

25:10.230 --> 25:12.565
Son, it is just a house.

25:12.599 --> 25:14.233
But it was your house, too.

25:15.936 --> 25:17.003
Remember this?

25:19.206 --> 25:20.206
Brother Falken?

25:21.341 --> 25:23.976
Falken? Pretty big <i>WarGames</i> fan,
right?

25:24.011 --> 25:25.178
You were in my office?

25:25.212 --> 25:27.980
In <i>WarGames,</i> the nerd
got to be the hero.

25:28.015 --> 25:30.082
Which isn't always the case.

25:30.117 --> 25:33.553
- That's very informative, Rusty.
- The name's Spitter.

25:33.587 --> 25:35.354
I'm a nerd, just like you.

25:35.389 --> 25:38.991
And KT's accepted me,
just like they accepted you.

25:39.026 --> 25:40.927
You can still be the hero here.

25:40.961 --> 25:45.064
Doesn't the spirit of KT
mean anything to you?

25:45.098 --> 25:46.933
Is this how you
want to be remembered?

25:46.967 --> 25:50.269
Rusty, when you leave college,

25:50.304 --> 25:53.873
this stuff doesn't go with you.

25:53.907 --> 25:57.410
None of this matters.
This athletic center though...

25:57.444 --> 25:59.712
...this will be my legacy.

26:02.716 --> 26:06.586
Now, we're all going to miss
the KT house, including me.

26:06.620 --> 26:10.823
But this is in the name of
making a better CRU, with a gym,

26:10.857 --> 26:13.826
racquetball courts, an
Olympic sized swimming pool.

26:13.860 --> 26:16.128
Oh really? Oh sweet!

26:16.163 --> 26:19.232
So, not everyone is
opposed to this idea.

26:19.266 --> 26:22.969
Now, I even have with me
two recent CRU grads,

26:23.003 --> 26:25.905
the former presidents
of ZBZ and Omega Chi,

26:25.939 --> 26:28.774
and they will explain to you why
this is a really good idea.

26:28.809 --> 26:30.910
Miss Cartwright? You're up.

26:38.385 --> 26:39.652
Say something.

26:45.392 --> 26:47.293
No.

26:56.737 --> 27:00.239
Casey, your legal career
hangs in the balance right now.

27:00.274 --> 27:01.707
Look, I'm sorry, Professor.

27:01.742 --> 27:03.409
But I don't want to be
remembered as the girl

27:03.443 --> 27:05.278
who helped tear down
the Kappa Tau house.

27:18.659 --> 27:19.925
It's all on you, Chambers.

27:19.960 --> 27:21.961
Are you going to choose your
future or your friends?

27:25.532 --> 27:30.703
Well, when you put it
like that...

27:35.242 --> 27:36.742
Thanks.

27:47.888 --> 27:49.722
OK.

27:51.291 --> 27:54.427
Tear it down, guys.

29:26.790 --> 29:28.490
You know, you did
all you could.

29:29.070 --> 29:32.162
Then why can't I help feeling
like I let the whole house down?

29:32.360 --> 29:34.728
And after all we went through to
get that stupid paddle.

29:34.762 --> 29:37.330
You were amazing, Rus.

29:37.365 --> 29:40.133
Seeing you stand up
to Lasker like that?

29:40.167 --> 29:44.271
You're not my geeky little brother who got
beat up by a sixth grader in high school.

29:44.305 --> 29:45.505
She was an eighth grader.

29:45.539 --> 29:47.407
And you heard Parkes.

29:47.441 --> 29:51.444
Without Kappa Tau, I'm
basically back to geeky Rusty.

29:51.479 --> 29:52.612
I don't believe that.

29:52.647 --> 29:54.881
You've changed.

29:55.816 --> 29:58.618
That old Rusty is gone for good.

29:58.653 --> 30:00.920
You know...

30:00.955 --> 30:05.892
You don't need me or anyone
to protect you anymore.

30:08.429 --> 30:09.896
You can handle yourself.

30:12.633 --> 30:14.000
I get that from you.

30:15.903 --> 30:19.272
The way you stood up to your professor,
that was pretty incredible.

30:19.307 --> 30:21.041
What?

30:21.075 --> 30:23.510
So, what are you going to do
about law school now?

30:24.578 --> 30:26.646
I have no idea.

30:26.681 --> 30:28.815
But I did the right thing.

30:28.849 --> 30:31.184
That's from you...

30:31.218 --> 30:32.485
...Jiminy Cricket.

30:32.520 --> 30:34.988
Come here.

30:44.665 --> 30:47.600
That was pretty impressive, what
you did at the Kappa Tau rally.

30:49.236 --> 30:50.503
You came here to tell me that?

30:50.538 --> 30:55.275
No. I came here
to ask you a question.

31:02.316 --> 31:07.387
Dale and I are doing this dumb
thing, so, I just wanted to ask:

31:07.421 --> 31:10.190
Why exactly did you and I
not work out?

31:16.997 --> 31:20.567
We couldn't work out
because I blew it.

31:20.601 --> 31:25.739
You know, I screwed up,
putting law school ahead of you.

31:25.773 --> 31:30.410
That's been something that's been
really hard for me to accept.

31:32.079 --> 31:34.280
What do you think
happened to my hand?

31:34.315 --> 31:38.385
- You got in a fight?
- With a wall.

31:39.920 --> 31:42.489
For what it's worth,
it's a really tough wall.

31:52.633 --> 31:54.000
It's Professor Segal.

31:55.436 --> 31:57.604
You better get that.

31:57.638 --> 31:59.739
Yeah.

31:59.774 --> 32:01.508
Good luck.

32:19.827 --> 32:21.928
Adios, KT.

32:23.197 --> 32:25.165
It was good knowing you.

32:27.668 --> 32:29.936
I see a lot of frowny faces!

32:29.970 --> 32:32.172
Spitter, we're standing in
Greek ruins. Literally.

32:32.206 --> 32:33.606
But you're still the president
of this house.

32:33.641 --> 32:35.108
Not if there's no house
to be president of.

32:35.142 --> 32:37.877
I'm so sorry, again, guys.

32:37.912 --> 32:40.346
I'm sensing a lot more family
therapy after all this.

32:40.381 --> 32:45.819
So Lasker grew into a bitter
nerd. So what?

32:48.722 --> 32:50.757
But it doesn't have
to be that way.

32:50.791 --> 32:53.159
He's a relic of the '80s.

32:53.194 --> 32:56.629
It's his generation who
tells us the real world sucks

32:56.664 --> 32:58.331
because they make it sucky.

32:58.365 --> 33:00.633
But he was right
about one thing.

33:00.668 --> 33:02.335
This was just a house.

33:02.403 --> 33:04.137
Kappa Tau isn't one person.

33:04.171 --> 33:08.041
Kappa tau isn't wood, it isn't
dry-rot, it isn't moldy wallpaper,

33:08.075 --> 33:09.709
it isn't beer-soaked carpets.

33:09.743 --> 33:13.480
It's living for the fun of life.
And that's what bonds us.

33:13.514 --> 33:18.451
As long as we remember that,
Kappa Tau lives on,

33:18.486 --> 33:22.822
past houses, past college.

33:24.158 --> 33:25.525
So, what do we do now, Spitter?

33:25.559 --> 33:29.128
Anybody who still has finals
to take... go study now.

33:29.163 --> 33:31.731
We're gonna have to get our
GPA up going into next semester.

33:31.765 --> 33:33.500
But where are we
gonna live then?

33:33.534 --> 33:35.101
We can't sleep in tents
all winter.

33:35.135 --> 33:36.970
In case you forgot,
this is Ohio.

33:37.004 --> 33:40.907
I'm gonna find a new house over break.
A better one. With working toilets.

33:40.941 --> 33:42.876
- Can I crash there?
- Absolutely!

33:44.879 --> 33:48.014
No more moping around. Get up!

33:48.048 --> 33:49.148
Let's go!

33:49.183 --> 33:53.019
Spit-ter!
Spit-ter! Spit-ter!

34:06.000 --> 34:07.700
Hey, what are you doing?

34:09.235 --> 34:12.405
I haven't been in here
since I left for New York.

34:12.438 --> 34:15.041
You know, this room
is crazy big.

34:15.074 --> 34:16.543
Yeah.

34:16.577 --> 34:20.280
I'm meeting Cappie at Dobler's,
if you want to come.

34:20.313 --> 34:21.848
Nah, I'm good.

34:21.882 --> 34:26.719
But, um, tell him
I'm sorry for his loss.

34:26.754 --> 34:29.155
Oh, and when you see Rusty,

34:29.188 --> 34:34.092
let him know that I thought it was pretty
cool how he stood up to Lasker like that.

34:34.128 --> 34:36.396
It was, huh?

34:36.429 --> 34:38.464
Um, I'll tell him you said so.

34:43.036 --> 34:46.272
You know... I was wrong.

34:47.507 --> 34:50.643
When I told you to be
careful with Rusty.

34:52.813 --> 34:56.114
He's a lot stronger than I gave
him credit for.

35:07.895 --> 35:09.829
You should've seen Rusty today.
You would've been proud.

35:09.863 --> 35:11.698
I already am.

35:12.866 --> 35:14.133
Hey, Crappie.

35:15.469 --> 35:16.536
The name's Cappie.

35:19.006 --> 35:21.774
And thanks for
your support today.

35:21.809 --> 35:25.445
Yeah, well... you know, seeing
Casey make that choice.

35:25.479 --> 35:27.013
And join you on the other side?

35:27.047 --> 35:29.115
It helped me realize
what really matters.

35:29.149 --> 35:31.317
Segal looked pissed, huh?

35:31.352 --> 35:32.485
Oh, he wants to see us both.

35:32.519 --> 35:33.987
I bet he does.

35:34.021 --> 35:37.390
I guess it's time
to start groveling.

35:37.424 --> 35:38.658
I'm not going to.

35:41.161 --> 35:43.630
I don't want to have to
compromise what I believe in.

35:43.664 --> 35:48.134
Law school, or defending Evil Corp
or Lasker Parkes, or whomever.

35:48.168 --> 35:50.536
It's not me.

35:50.571 --> 35:52.705
What am I supposed to do now?

35:52.740 --> 35:58.544
Go to Washington,
no law degree? No plan?

35:59.980 --> 36:01.014
Why the hell not?

36:05.886 --> 36:10.823
Yeah... why the hell not?
I'll go with you.

36:10.858 --> 36:13.059
I got one more final to pass,
then I can graduate.

36:13.093 --> 36:14.994
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You can graduate?

36:15.029 --> 36:17.530
- Accidentally.
- What?

36:17.564 --> 36:20.767
- What about KT? - After today, I'm pretty
sure Rusty can handle it.

36:21.902 --> 36:23.603
We'll figure it out together.

36:36.550 --> 36:38.685
As it should be.

36:38.719 --> 36:40.586
There's just one problem.

36:40.621 --> 36:42.488
I've barely studied
for my last class.

36:42.523 --> 36:43.923
- Then we should get going!
- Go!

36:43.957 --> 36:45.591
- Are you...
- Yeah, yeah, go.

36:47.227 --> 36:48.895

37:09.983 --> 37:12.652
Couldn't live on the futon
forever, huh?

37:12.686 --> 37:15.188
Yeah.

37:15.222 --> 37:17.824
Well, I have a rule that
I don't date roommates.

37:17.858 --> 37:22.562
It's kind of a new rule, since
I've only ever lived with girls.

37:22.596 --> 37:26.299
Mostly your sister, and this
really big rat in New York.

37:26.333 --> 37:29.469
Neither of whom I
wanted to date. But...

37:29.503 --> 37:31.270

38:00.352 --> 38:03.154
'The only true wisdom is in knowing
you know nothing.' Socrates.

38:03.889 --> 38:06.557
OK, well, Socrates didn't text.

38:07.593 --> 38:08.864
I'm here! I'm here!
I'm sorry!

38:09.061 --> 38:13.731
I overslept because
I was up all night preparing,

38:14.399 --> 38:16.567
and then my house was torn down,

38:17.503 --> 38:19.670
and I, I just, I need this
credit to graduate.

38:20.639 --> 38:23.474
Class is over. I'm afraid
you have no more time.

38:27.646 --> 38:29.380
But what is time?

38:33.819 --> 38:36.654
I see you've been
paying attention.

38:37.156 --> 38:40.525
OK... you can present.

38:41.393 --> 38:44.162
For your final,
I just have one question.

38:44.363 --> 38:45.163
Why?

38:45.497 --> 38:48.900
Because you're lazy?
I'm just joking.

38:52.771 --> 38:56.140
Well, the first thing you asked us at
the beginning of the semester was,

38:56.608 --> 38:56.841
'Why are we here?'

38:57.643 --> 38:59.277
Well, I thought about that.
A lot.

38:59.778 --> 39:01.012
We all have a purpose.

39:02.014 --> 39:04.549
And our purpose is to
figure out our purpose.

39:05.117 --> 39:05.783
That's what college is.

39:06.385 --> 39:08.553
<i>So why college? Why CRU?</i>

39:10.222 --> 39:13.324
<i>The truth is, I chose CRU because a
friend of mine from camp was going here.</i>

39:14.560 --> 39:15.860
<i>Then I chose to rush a fraternity,
and I made new friends,</i>

39:17.296 --> 39:21.532
<i>and college has been everything</i> <i>I
could've ever imagined it to be...</i>

39:22.034 --> 39:22.266
<i>so I kept thinking,</i>

39:23.202 --> 39:24.535
<i>why would I ever</i>
<i>want to leave this place?</i>

39:25.070 --> 39:27.071
<i>But then I realized...</i>

39:28.140 --> 39:30.441
...that there's so much left
to learn, and experience,

39:30.943 --> 39:31.309
<i>and look forward to.</i>

39:32.177 --> 39:35.179
<i>And now I'm graduating...</i>
<i>hopefully...</i>

39:36.648 --> 39:38.516
<i>...and heading out into the real
world with the love of my life,</i>

39:39.051 --> 39:39.917
<i>who was my purpose.</i>

39:40.586 --> 39:43.321
So, today, I'm here to graduate.

39:44.223 --> 39:45.590
<i>And tomorrow?</i>
<i>Well, that's har$ to say,</i>

39:46.425 --> 39:49.193
<i>because I have no idea</i>
<i>where I'll be.</i>

39:49.828 --> 39:50.962
Nice hat.

39:54.499 --> 39:55.800
This is your real name?

39:56.668 --> 39:59.704
"Captain John Paul Jones"?

40:00.305 --> 40:00.504
How did we never know that?

40:01.740 --> 40:03.574
Congratulations, Cappie. This is
an emotional day for all of us.

40:04.476 --> 40:08.012
I guess we should drink
to KT's newest alum.

40:08.647 --> 40:09.914
Oh.

40:10.649 --> 40:11.349
And to Calvin!

40:12.084 --> 40:13.818
We're gonna miss you
next semester.

40:14.820 --> 40:16.520
You're going abroad, right?
Going to help people.

40:17.623 --> 40:19.323
Yeah, we leave for India the
first week of the new year.

40:19.791 --> 40:20.958
Not playing it safe.

40:21.159 --> 40:21.692
Hey.

40:22.160 --> 40:22.894
Best way to play.

40:23.729 --> 40:26.497
Dale lavaliered me!

40:28.934 --> 40:29.834
I brought this here as well.

40:30.235 --> 40:31.669
Oh, you didn't.

40:32.704 --> 40:35.539
- And this!
- Oh my God!

40:38.777 --> 40:40.778
They say that that if you sit
in it and it fits,

40:41.246 --> 40:42.546
you're KT president.

40:43.348 --> 40:44.782
Go ahead, try it out.

40:46.418 --> 40:47.985
Do a test drive there.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.787
Test it out.

40:51.189 --> 40:52.256
Oh!

40:53.058 --> 40:55.660
And the transfer of power
is complete!

40:56.261 --> 40:58.729
You are my legacy, Spitter.

40:59.965 --> 41:01.065
Here's to the new KT president.

41:05.804 --> 41:07.171
Shots! Shots! Shots!

41:07.739 --> 41:11.909
And to Cappie! The best...

41:14.513 --> 41:16.447
Long live KT!

41:19.918 --> 41:21.152
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:21.787 --> 41:23.654
Yeah!

41:28.393 --> 41:30.962
I'm sorry I'm leaving again.

41:31.763 --> 41:32.897
Well, I'm not
following you this time.

41:33.665 --> 41:37.568
I have my own apartment,
my own job.

41:38.103 --> 41:39.503
And a new relationship.

41:40.439 --> 41:42.106
Take care of each other.

41:46.211 --> 41:48.079
I can't believe you're
making me hire a new house mom.

41:48.747 --> 41:52.183
Oh, I will miss the sorority.

41:55.220 --> 41:56.454
And you.

41:57.356 --> 41:58.756
I know.

42:06.665 --> 42:08.532

42:30.956 --> 42:33.024
Love you.

42:34.359 --> 42:36.527
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:40.065 --> 42:42.533
- Hey, keep in touch, man.
- You too.

42:43.101 --> 42:44.201
Thanks.

42:44.469 --> 42:46.470
Case.

42:51.977 --> 42:53.310
It arrived this morning.

42:56.548 --> 42:59.183
And, since you were such an integral
part of us winning the Golden Lily,

42:59.818 --> 43:00.351
I'd like to give it to you.

43:01.019 --> 43:02.286
Oh my God, I couldn't possibly.

43:03.188 --> 43:06.090
I said I'd like to,
not that I was going to.

43:08.060 --> 43:08.659
Have a safe trip.

43:09.094 --> 43:10.995
- Bye.
- Bye.

43:14.866 --> 43:17.768
Well, Dale, this is it.

43:18.770 --> 43:21.105
You could've been the
future Mrs. Dale Kettlewell.

43:21.840 --> 43:24.909
- Never forget that.
- I won't.

43:30.148 --> 43:32.216
Don't forget that either.

43:33.118 --> 43:35.853
- Dale?
- Bye, buddy.

43:39.858 --> 43:42.193
Take care of my sister for me,
OK?

43:42.494 --> 43:44.528
I promise.

43:50.969 --> 43:52.837
I love you, Casey.

43:53.238 --> 43:55.639
I love you, too.

44:03.315 --> 44:04.482
See you later.

44:05.117 --> 44:06.117
You ready?

44:06.118 --> 44:08.953
Yeah.

44:10.856 --> 44:12.790
Bye, guys!

44:13.859 --> 44:15.659
Take care.

44:27.506 --> 44:32.376
So, um... where to?

44:35.447 --> 44:37.281
Wherever you're going.
