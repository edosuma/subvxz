WEBVTT

00:12.834 --> 00:14.968
Our security police have
completed their initial sweep

00:15.000 --> 00:16.233
of the capital city.

00:16.234 --> 00:18.132
65 known members of the
opposition have been arrested

00:18.133 --> 00:19.566
and are being
questioned.

00:19.567 --> 00:20.633
Have you learned anything?

00:20.634 --> 00:21.633
Were any of them

00:21.634 --> 00:22.733
working with my brother?

00:22.734 --> 00:23.833
It's too early to tell.

00:23.834 --> 00:25.934
Kayla, your father
is a great man,

00:25.968 --> 00:28.200
but Farhad's betrayal
has changed him.

00:28.234 --> 00:30.134
What can we do?

00:30.300 --> 00:32.066
The president says

00:32.067 --> 00:33.466
you may be involved
with his brother.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.733
He's ordered me
to detain you.

00:34.734 --> 00:37.100
I'll talk to him.

00:37.133 --> 00:39.501
President Hassan's
crackdown

00:39.534 --> 00:42.868
isn't just a response
to the attempt on his life.

00:42.901 --> 00:45.801
There are unsecured
nuclear materials in play.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.734
CTU is running
an undercover operation

00:47.734 --> 00:49.767
to retrieve them as we speak.

00:49.801 --> 00:51.166
I've got something.

00:51.167 --> 00:54.100
It's an NYPD evidence lockup.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.600
A local vice group

00:55.601 --> 00:57.501
just impounded
$120,000.

00:57.534 --> 01:00.467
I help you do this and
you never call me again.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.233
That's beautiful, man.
Absolutely beautiful.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.433
It's a cop.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.367
You're going to have
to slip past him.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.801
I'm at the warehouse...
Nick!

01:10.834 --> 01:12.399
Kevin, stop him!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.334
I hear there are materials

01:14.367 --> 01:15.833
for sale.

01:15.834 --> 01:16.833
Talk straight.

01:16.834 --> 01:17.833
What materials?

01:17.834 --> 01:19.266
Nuclear rods.

01:19.267 --> 01:21.467
Nobody deals
in nuclear rods, nobody.

01:21.501 --> 01:22.666
We have a problem.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.868
Vladimir Laitanan knows
about the fuel rods.

01:24.901 --> 01:26.299
Come on, Vladimir,
push them harder.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.267
Somebody knows something.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.334
No one knows,
there's no one left to call.

01:30.367 --> 01:31.366
Look, it's over!

01:31.367 --> 01:33.267
What is wrong
with you?!

01:38.701 --> 01:39.700
Renee.

01:39.701 --> 01:41.566
Stop, stop.

01:41.567 --> 01:43.433
They're Russian.
What are you doing?

01:43.434 --> 01:45.166
I need to let them take me.

01:45.167 --> 01:47.434
When CTU gets here, you tell them
to start tracking me from the air.

01:47.467 --> 01:49.534
These people are gonna lead us
to everything we're looking for.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.467
I'm unarmed, don't shoot.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.767
We can do business.

01:54.801 --> 01:55.800
Where's Jack?

01:55.801 --> 01:57.566
The Russians took him.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.634
He said that you'd be
monitoring him from the air.

01:59.667 --> 02:00.666
We haven't seen anything.

02:00.667 --> 02:02.567
Where is he?

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.133 --> 02:26.199
Yeah?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.299
Where the hell are you?

02:27.300 --> 02:29.200
Hey, Jenny girl!
You said you would call me

02:29.234 --> 02:31.134
as soon as the two of you
got clear.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.100
I'm sorry, sweetheart,
I forgot.

02:33.133 --> 02:34.800
We-we got- hold on-
we got caught up

02:34.801 --> 02:36.701
celebrating our score.

02:36.701 --> 02:37.833
Celebrating?

02:37.834 --> 02:40.234
You put a police officer
in the hospital.

02:40.267 --> 02:42.467
Hey, that wasn't
me, that was Nick.

02:42.501 --> 02:45.133
A- And look, why do, why do you
got to focus on the negative?

02:45.167 --> 02:48.501
We're flush 120 grand.

02:48.534 --> 02:50.233
Why don't you just
come down here,

02:50.234 --> 02:52.032
have a drink,
celebrate with us?

02:52.033 --> 02:55.033
We're at a club in Jersey
City called Starlight.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.466
We'll work
out your cut.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.700
What cut?

02:57.701 --> 02:59.366
I don't want anything from you,
Kevin.

02:59.367 --> 03:00.999
We're done.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.800
I want you
to put my key

03:02.801 --> 03:05.167
in my mailbox
and get the hell out of my life

03:05.200 --> 03:07.100
like you promised.

03:09.467 --> 03:12.334
Yeah, that-that's not going
to happen.

03:12.367 --> 03:14.934
What does that mean?

03:14.968 --> 03:17.334
This is a sweet operation that
we got going here, you know?

03:17.367 --> 03:18.366
You getting the access codes

03:18.367 --> 03:21.400
and-and us
pulling the jobs.

03:21.434 --> 03:23.032
W- W-Wait...

03:23.033 --> 03:25.133
We had a deal, Kevin.

03:25.167 --> 03:27.501
You promised me
I do this one thing for you

03:27.534 --> 03:28.999
and then you leave me alone.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.033
I- I know and I, and I, and
I meant that, all right,

03:33.067 --> 03:36.801
but things change,
okay, an-an-and...

03:36.834 --> 03:38.734
We can get rich
off of this, Jenny.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.667
You can't do this
to me, Kevin.

03:41.701 --> 03:44.033
Jenny, please...

03:44.067 --> 03:45.833
Look, bitch,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.500
you're in this
up to your neck.

03:47.501 --> 03:49.834
You want your boss and want
your boyfriend finding out

03:49.868 --> 03:52.200
you're not who
you say you are?

03:52.234 --> 03:55.033
You're gonna be our
golden goose, okay?

04:01.267 --> 04:03.234
Hello?
Dana.

04:04.267 --> 04:05.333
What are you doing?

04:05.334 --> 04:06.766
We got a situation;
you need to be

04:06.767 --> 04:08.667
on the floor.

04:08.667 --> 04:10.032
Dana...

04:10.033 --> 04:12.200
I heard you, I will
be right there.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.933
Who was that
on the phone just now?

04:13.934 --> 04:14.967
That's none of your business.

04:14.968 --> 04:15.967
Actually, it is.

04:15.968 --> 04:16.966
When you start
sneaking away

04:16.968 --> 04:19.367
to make phone calls
or leave the office,

04:19.399 --> 04:20.733
making me cover for you,

04:20.733 --> 04:22.634
it becomes my business.

04:22.667 --> 04:23.800
Now, who was that?

04:23.801 --> 04:24.867
Kevin?

04:24.868 --> 04:27.834
How the hell would you...?

04:27.868 --> 04:29.566
Are you spying on me?

04:29.567 --> 04:31.534
Look, you want to step out
on your fiancÃƒÂ©,

04:31.567 --> 04:32.600
it's fine with me.

04:32.601 --> 04:34.199
God knows I've got
no love for the guy.

04:34.200 --> 04:35.766
You have no idea what
you are talking about.

04:35.767 --> 04:36.867
I am not cheating
on Cole.

04:36.868 --> 04:39.167
Okay, whatever you
want to call it,

04:39.200 --> 04:42.567
you'd better start telling
your boyfriend what's going on

04:42.601 --> 04:43.800
or I will.

04:43.801 --> 04:45.266
Now, come on.

04:45.267 --> 04:48.234
Our undercover operation
just went south.

04:48.267 --> 04:49.999
What's happened?

04:50.000 --> 04:50.999
Jack Bauer was grabbed

04:51.000 --> 04:53.267
by an unknown group
of armed Russians.

04:53.300 --> 04:55.701
We think they're the ones
in control of the nuclear rods.

04:55.734 --> 04:56.766
Are we tracking them?

04:56.767 --> 04:59.033
We can't.

04:59.067 --> 05:00.633
They took Bauer
through an underground access

05:00.634 --> 05:01.666
behind the building.

05:01.667 --> 05:02.800
Without aerial support, the best

05:02.801 --> 05:04.032
my people could do
was track them

05:04.033 --> 05:06.767
to a drainage junction
near Avenue Y and Ocean.

05:06.801 --> 05:08.433
They must have had a
vehicle standing by.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.933
Jack's cell phone was
trashed at the scene.

05:09.934 --> 05:11.299
Well, there has to be
something at the site

05:11.300 --> 05:12.867
to help us I.D.
the vehicle.

05:12.868 --> 05:14.934
Tire treads,
transmission fluid,

05:14.968 --> 05:16.366
oil residue?

05:16.367 --> 05:18.032
No, there's nothing, sir,
the trail's gone cold.

05:18.033 --> 05:19.233
Well, what about Walker?

05:19.234 --> 05:21.099
Did she get a good look
at these people?

05:21.100 --> 05:22.399
I don't know, sir.

05:22.400 --> 05:24.701
Frankly, she's pretty
messed up right now.

05:24.734 --> 05:25.733
Blaming herself

05:25.734 --> 05:26.733
for Jack's circumstances.

05:26.734 --> 05:28.066
Well, she should.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.534
She crippled this operation
when she murdered her contact.

05:30.567 --> 05:33.501
Without Vladimir Laitanan, we
have no lead to finding Bauer

05:33.534 --> 05:35.066
or the nuclear
materials.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.033
You get her back to CTU
for debriefing.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.700
I want to know
what the hell happened.

05:38.701 --> 05:40.566
Yes, sir.

05:40.567 --> 05:41.600
You might want
to consider

05:41.601 --> 05:43.166
running a psych eval
on her when we arrive.

05:43.167 --> 05:44.733
Count on it.

05:44.734 --> 05:45.999
You were supposed

05:46.000 --> 05:47.700
to be coordinating
with NSA,

05:47.701 --> 05:49.032
monitoring chatter.

05:49.033 --> 05:50.934
I know, something came up,
I had to take care of it.

05:50.968 --> 05:52.868
What was so important?

05:54.267 --> 05:56.167
It's my fault, Mr. Hastings.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.533
I asked Dana to
recover a datalog

05:57.534 --> 05:59.366
I accidentally deleted
from archives.

05:59.367 --> 06:01.267
I didn't have clearance.

06:01.300 --> 06:03.734
I'm uplinking to
NSA servers now.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.999
All right.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.166
Just get on it.

06:10.167 --> 06:12.334
Roll back any chatter
within the last 20 minutes.

06:12.367 --> 06:14.501
Right now
that's all we've got.

06:14.534 --> 06:15.967
Let me know
if something turns up.

06:15.968 --> 06:18.934
I need to brief
President Taylor.

06:19.934 --> 06:21.533
Thank you.

06:21.534 --> 06:22.967
You can thank me
by putting aside

06:22.968 --> 06:24.533
whatever it is
that's bothering you

06:24.534 --> 06:25.633
and helping me
find Jack.

06:25.634 --> 06:26.633
He's my friend

06:26.634 --> 06:28.601
and he's in trouble.

06:43.234 --> 06:45.834
Take him down the hall.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.801
Where is Vladimir?

06:51.834 --> 06:52.933
Dead.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.400
So are his men.

06:55.434 --> 06:58.133
The German said
they tried to rip him off.

06:58.167 --> 07:02.033
Did he also say how he knows
about the fuel rods?

07:28.567 --> 07:29.900
Who are you?

07:29.901 --> 07:31.968
Ernst Meier.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.901
I've been looking for you
to make you an offer.

07:34.934 --> 07:36.533
You know who I am?

07:36.534 --> 07:37.533
No.

07:37.534 --> 07:38.666
All I know is that there's

07:38.667 --> 07:39.999
a very powerful man
in the Russian syndicate

07:40.000 --> 07:41.333
who's been trafficking
weapons-grade uranium,

07:41.334 --> 07:43.667
specifically U-235

07:43.701 --> 07:44.800
fuel rods.

07:44.801 --> 07:46.801
After the nasty business
with Laitanan,

07:46.834 --> 07:48.533
these men brought me here,

07:48.534 --> 07:51.000
so I'm just assuming
you're that man.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.767
Where did you get
this information?

07:53.801 --> 07:56.434
I represent a consortium
of private interests.

07:56.467 --> 07:59.067
They intercepted communiquÃƒÂ©s
within the Islamic republic.

07:59.100 --> 08:01.434
From whom?

08:02.501 --> 08:04.501
Farhad Hassan...

08:04.534 --> 08:06.534
or someone
in his camp.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.367
In either case, you're doing
business with the wrong people.

08:09.400 --> 08:12.634
And who are these people-
the ones you work for?

08:13.667 --> 08:15.634
I'm sure you can understand

08:15.667 --> 08:17.734
I'm not at liberty to say.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.167
Aah!

08:25.901 --> 08:27.433
You should be less concerned
about who I work for

08:27.434 --> 08:28.533
and more concerned
about the deal

08:28.534 --> 08:29.900
that they're willing
to offer you.

08:29.901 --> 08:32.167
I'm not interested
in your offer.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.133
$250 million,

08:34.167 --> 08:36.833
half of which is ready to be
wired to you immediately.

08:36.868 --> 08:38.399
The other half you will receive

08:38.400 --> 08:40.833
upon final acquisition
of the fuel rods.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.199
You pose
a very difficult problem for me.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.666
You show up
out of nowhere,

08:52.667 --> 08:55.033
knowing far too much
of my business,

08:55.067 --> 08:56.533
yet I've never
heard of you.

08:56.534 --> 08:59.534
You've never heard of me
because I'm good at what I do.

08:59.567 --> 09:04.000
What I'm concerned about...
is that you're a cop.

09:04.033 --> 09:05.900
I just killed three people
back at that garage.

09:05.901 --> 09:08.200
Vladimir Laitanan-
I stabbed in the eye.

09:08.234 --> 09:10.834
You really think I'm a cop?

09:10.868 --> 09:12.066
As a child,

09:12.067 --> 09:14.767
I saw KGB throw
an entire family

09:14.801 --> 09:16.433
off the roof of a building,

09:16.434 --> 09:20.000
two of them small children.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.968
I know what cops are capable of.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.299
So I ask you again:

09:24.300 --> 09:25.466
Who do you work for?

09:25.467 --> 09:28.334
I'm sorry,
I can't tell you that.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.667
Dimitri, work on him
until he's ready

09:30.701 --> 09:32.601
to tell us everything.

09:33.400 --> 09:36.167
No, we can make a deal.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.967
We can still make a deal!

09:37.968 --> 09:40.100
No! No!

09:41.167 --> 09:43.167
No!

09:50.634 --> 09:52.601
You have buried
your brother's body?

10:03.968 --> 10:06.801
It's Oleg's necklace.

10:06.834 --> 10:09.133
You gave it to him
at his confirmation.

10:11.167 --> 10:13.067
You keep it.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.567
To remind you of him.

10:19.534 --> 10:22.067
I'm glad you're back.

10:22.100 --> 10:24.234
We may have
a problem.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.666
What is it?

10:25.667 --> 10:30.234
There is a man down the hall
who claims to be an arms broker.

10:30.267 --> 10:32.300
He knows about the nuclear rods.

10:32.334 --> 10:34.400
How could he?

10:34.434 --> 10:40.100
He says there was a leak from
Farhad's people, but I wonder.

10:40.133 --> 10:43.567
Until I know for certain
who and what this man is,

10:43.601 --> 10:45.466
I've stopped the transport
of the rods.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.299
They've been redirected
to our weigh station

10:47.300 --> 10:48.600
off the Wantagh Parkway.

10:48.601 --> 10:51.167
I'm sure Farhad can't
be happy about that.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.667
I haven't told him yet.

10:58.334 --> 11:00.334
Perhaps we should
tell him together.

11:01.968 --> 11:04.300
How long do you plan
to hold him off?

11:04.334 --> 11:05.633
That depends.

11:05.634 --> 11:06.999
On what?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.701
On how long it takes Dimitri
to break this guy.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.433
Okay, Mr. Policeman.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.533
I'm not a cop.

11:25.534 --> 11:26.700
I swear to you.

11:26.701 --> 11:28.601
Please, don't do this.

11:33.634 --> 11:35.534
Tell me what you know.

11:51.967 --> 11:53.566
We are exhausting all efforts

11:53.567 --> 11:56.001
to ascertain who took Bauer
and where,

11:56.034 --> 11:58.500
but until any progress is made,
we just have to hope

11:58.533 --> 11:59.900
that Jack can find some way

11:59.901 --> 12:01.766
of salvaging the operation
on his end.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.901
What even makes you think
he's still alive?

12:03.934 --> 12:05.466
Only the fact
that he wasn't killed

12:05.467 --> 12:06.799
at the point of abduction.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.934
Mr. Hastings,
I need a realistic assessment.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.433
What are the odds of
finding and securing

12:11.467 --> 12:13.700
these nuclear weapons
within the next few hours?

12:13.734 --> 12:14.866
I can't answer that, ma'am,

12:14.867 --> 12:16.367
but the longer
we're out of touch

12:16.368 --> 12:18.500
with Bauer,
the less likely our chances.

12:18.533 --> 12:20.367
All right, Mr. Hastings.

12:20.368 --> 12:22.533
Continue to coordinate
with my office.

12:22.567 --> 12:24.533
I want updates every 30 minutes.

12:24.567 --> 12:26.467
Yes, ma'am.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.700
I just spoke to General Wasim.

12:29.734 --> 12:31.066
He's very worried.

12:31.067 --> 12:33.967
Your brother's crackdowns
back home are intensifying.

12:34.001 --> 12:35.901
Everyone
is being arrested.

12:35.901 --> 12:38.034
Our window of opportunity
is closing.

12:38.067 --> 12:39.967
And why didn't the general
call me himself?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.166
Perhaps he's losing confidence

12:41.167 --> 12:43.134
in your ability
to complete our mission.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.466
This is my mission.

12:44.467 --> 12:45.633
My plan!

12:45.634 --> 12:47.000
Of course.

12:47.001 --> 12:48.934
But we're running
out of time.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.532
If your brother dismantles
our opposition forces,

12:50.533 --> 12:51.900
we will no
longer be able

12:51.901 --> 12:53.300
to reconstitute our
nuclear program.

12:53.301 --> 12:54.799
He won't succeed.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.700
At this rate, he will.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.466
How much longer
must we wait

12:58.467 --> 13:00.133
for the delivery
of the uranium?

13:00.134 --> 13:01.733
Not long.

13:01.734 --> 13:04.001
The rods should be arriving
to you within the hour.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.934
Have your men ready.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.734
I'll call you back.

13:10.034 --> 13:11.466
Yes? What is it?

13:11.467 --> 13:13.533
There is a man downstairs
who's shown up

13:13.567 --> 13:15.432
to outbid you for
the fuel rods.

13:15.433 --> 13:18.567
Is this some feeble attempt
to renegotiate terms?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.367
Not at all. This man, Meier,

13:20.368 --> 13:21.933
claims someone in
your organization

13:21.934 --> 13:23.499
tipped him off to our deal.

13:23.500 --> 13:25.333
That's not possible. He's lying.

13:25.334 --> 13:27.268
At any rate, in light of
his sudden appearance,

13:27.301 --> 13:29.368
I'm halting delivery of the rods
for the time being.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.633
What? You can't do that.

13:30.634 --> 13:31.866
It's already done.

13:31.867 --> 13:35.167
I cannot take the risk
that we may be exposed.

13:35.201 --> 13:36.633
The longer you delay,
the more time

13:36.634 --> 13:38.100
my brother has
to crush his enemies.

13:38.101 --> 13:40.034
If he manages to purge everyone
in the military

13:40.067 --> 13:42.467
who opposes him,
the uranium is worthless to me.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.666
That's your concern.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.667
Mine is to make
certain this Meier

13:45.700 --> 13:46.833
is not a policeman.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.734
One of my men
is interrogating him now.

13:48.734 --> 13:51.001
That could take hours,
even days.

13:51.034 --> 13:52.532
Not days.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.301
I can promise you that.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.533
You promised
to assassinate my brother, too.

13:57.567 --> 13:58.866
Your failure
to eliminate him

13:58.867 --> 14:00.800
has put me under
enormous pressure, and now,

14:00.834 --> 14:03.334
because of your people's
inability to maintain secrecy,

14:03.368 --> 14:07.268
you break our agreed timetable
to suit your needs.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.334
Don't speak
to my father that way.

14:10.368 --> 14:12.800
We've honored
every agreement

14:12.834 --> 14:13.933
we made with you,

14:13.934 --> 14:15.699
and shed a lot
of blood for it.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.800
My father's allowed you
to stay here

14:17.834 --> 14:19.000
and hide from the Feds

14:19.001 --> 14:21.567
at great personal risk
to our family.

14:21.600 --> 14:25.700
Tell him to put the gun down.

14:25.734 --> 14:26.933
No.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.034
We're not taking any
more of your demands.

14:30.067 --> 14:31.833
Throw him out
of here.

14:31.834 --> 14:35.533
Let his own people shelter him
if he thinks we're such fools.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.100
I'll drive him
there myself

14:37.101 --> 14:39.001
if that's what
it takes.

14:43.134 --> 14:45.667
It would seem you have used up
our hospitality here.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.499
Perhaps it's best
you join your men

14:47.500 --> 14:50.901
at the rendezvous point
to wait for delivery.

14:53.700 --> 14:55.399
And when will that be?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.233
When I think it's safe.

14:57.234 --> 14:59.134
Not a moment before.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.134
Make sure he gets
where he's going.

15:33.067 --> 15:34.432
Still got men

15:34.433 --> 15:36.100
back at the scene
in case we missed something.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.833
In the meantime,
I'll work out

15:37.834 --> 15:40.667
the aerial sweep
protocols with Arlo.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.532
What are you doing to find Jack?

15:42.533 --> 15:44.734
Everything we can, Ms. Walker.
Come with me.

15:44.767 --> 15:46.800
Have you checked
all the... the traffic cams,

15:46.834 --> 15:48.133
subway routes?

15:48.134 --> 15:49.966
You have all this technology
working for you-

15:49.967 --> 15:51.599
comm surveillance,
satellite tracking.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.167
We're using everything
at our disposal.

15:54.201 --> 15:56.268
Then how come
you haven't found him yet?

15:56.301 --> 15:57.933
Why don't you have any leads?

15:57.934 --> 16:00.134
The best lead we had is dead.

16:01.934 --> 16:04.034
I know about
your suicide attempt.

16:04.067 --> 16:06.101
You should have been honest
with me.

16:06.134 --> 16:09.567
O'Brian will take
your statement.

16:09.600 --> 16:12.201
I want to know every detail
about every event

16:12.234 --> 16:14.167
leading up to the death
of Vladimir Laitanan.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.734
When she's done,
take her to medical.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.001
I've ordered a full
psych evaluation.

16:25.034 --> 16:27.067
Yes, sir.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.700
Uh,

16:32.734 --> 16:34.700
you can write
your statement here.

16:42.467 --> 16:44.500
Hastings blames me
for what happened to Jack.

16:44.533 --> 16:46.000
And he's right.

16:46.001 --> 16:47.633
No, he's not.

16:47.634 --> 16:49.532
He shouldn't have said that.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.399
The only reason
that Jack was even

16:51.400 --> 16:54.734
part of this operation
was because of me.

16:54.767 --> 16:56.667
So whatever they're doing
to him right now,

16:56.667 --> 16:58.901
it's because of me.

17:00.700 --> 17:03.201
I have to find him, Chloe.

17:03.234 --> 17:07.034
Renee, I know how you must feel.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.400
Just... just take
one thing at a time.

17:12.400 --> 17:15.967
We have to deal
with what you did.

17:16.001 --> 17:18.166
So write your
statement.

17:18.201 --> 17:20.334
Ill check back with you.

17:29.334 --> 17:30.599
Cole.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.599
Hey.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.966
Do you have some time?

17:32.967 --> 17:34.300
I need to talk to you.

17:34.301 --> 17:35.733
Can it wait?

17:35.734 --> 17:37.834
I need to review these protocols
before Arlo distributes them.

17:37.867 --> 17:39.432
I've got it covered.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.333
Go talk to your girlfriend.

17:52.268 --> 17:53.633
What's up?

17:53.634 --> 17:54.799
You all right?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.901
No, I'm not.

17:56.934 --> 17:58.300
I have a big problem.

17:58.301 --> 18:02.433
And it's the reason why
I've been acting kind of weird

18:02.467 --> 18:04.133
the past few days.

18:04.134 --> 18:06.101
Okay.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.367
Listen, if you're
calling off the engagement,

18:10.368 --> 18:12.133
you couldn't have
picked a worse day.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.234
No.

18:14.268 --> 18:16.166
No, I would never do that.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.699
Good.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.166
So what's bothering you?

18:19.167 --> 18:22.067
There are things about my past

18:22.101 --> 18:24.533
that I haven't told you.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.867
I'm listening.

18:29.934 --> 18:31.033
Hey.

18:31.034 --> 18:32.532
I'm sure I haven't told you

18:32.533 --> 18:34.800
everything about
my past either.

18:34.834 --> 18:37.800
I don't care what happened
before I met you.

18:37.834 --> 18:39.399
All that matters is now

18:39.400 --> 18:41.166
and what we have
to look forward to.

18:41.167 --> 18:45.433
I think that's all
that matters, too.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.034
So what are you
so worried about?

18:50.101 --> 18:52.001
I don't want to lose you.

18:52.034 --> 18:54.834
I'm not going anywhere.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.100
Excuse me.

18:58.101 --> 19:00.533
Agent Ortiz, Mr. Hastings
needs to see you in his office.

19:00.567 --> 19:02.734
Uh, tell him I'll be
there as soon as I can.

19:02.767 --> 19:04.633
No. Go.
Hastings can wait.

19:04.634 --> 19:05.900
So can this.

19:05.901 --> 19:07.633
Talking to you has helped.

19:07.634 --> 19:09.867
I think I know
what I need to do now.

19:09.901 --> 19:11.633
You sure?

19:11.634 --> 19:13.333
Mm-hmm.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.800
Okay.

19:15.834 --> 19:18.134
Maybe later you tell me
what this is all about.

19:37.334 --> 19:39.234
Who do you
work for?

19:44.901 --> 19:46.801
Who else knows
about the fuel rods?

19:48.934 --> 19:50.100
Everybody
has a limit.

19:50.101 --> 19:52.800
Don't worry,

19:52.834 --> 19:54.734
I'll find yours.

19:58.268 --> 19:59.933
You're working with the police.

19:59.934 --> 20:01.166
Admit it!

20:01.167 --> 20:03.234
Tell me and the
pain will stop.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.168
Who else knows?

20:08.734 --> 20:12.034
I told you... I'm not a cop.

20:12.067 --> 20:13.066
Please.

20:13.067 --> 20:15.400
I'm just a businessman.

20:15.433 --> 20:16.633
Please.

20:16.634 --> 20:18.534
Who do you work for?

20:20.067 --> 20:22.500
I'm an independent contractor.

20:22.533 --> 20:24.333
I couldn't even tell you
if I wanted.

20:24.334 --> 20:26.234
Please.

20:26.700 --> 20:28.600
We'll see.

20:36.634 --> 20:38.233
Wake up.

20:38.234 --> 20:40.800
I said, wake up.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.501
I told you
I didn't want to be disturbed.

22:00.534 --> 22:03.401
Your daughter is still demanding
to see you, Mr. President.

22:03.434 --> 22:05.567
She refuses to leave.

22:05.601 --> 22:07.501
Very well. Send her in.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.967
Kayla, my love,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.467
I'm in the middle of a crisis,
so unless it's an emergency...

22:17.501 --> 22:19.467
It is an emergency.

22:19.501 --> 22:21.933
We need to talk about you
having Tarin arrested.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.933
Tarin has been taken
to the embassy

22:23.967 --> 22:26.933
to help clarify a few questions,

22:26.967 --> 22:28.366
strictly routine.

22:28.367 --> 22:30.701
I know you believe
he's been working against you.

22:30.734 --> 22:33.167
What I don't understand is why.

22:35.234 --> 22:37.200
He refused to follow my orders.

22:37.234 --> 22:39.200
You asked him to
arrest the family

22:39.234 --> 22:40.932
of one of
your delegates.

22:40.933 --> 22:42.900
A man you considered
a friend.

22:42.933 --> 22:45.900
Kayla, this is a matter of
state; it doesn't concern you.

22:45.933 --> 22:47.900
It doesn't make sense.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.767
Tarin was in the car with you-

22:49.768 --> 22:51.734
if the assassination
attempt was successful,

22:51.768 --> 22:53.266
he would've been killed, too.

22:53.267 --> 22:55.800
The world is full of men willing
to die for their cause.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.800
I know you consider
Tarin a friend.

22:57.833 --> 22:59.900
And your loyalty
is commendable.

22:59.933 --> 23:01.600
But trust me, I have my reasons.

23:01.601 --> 23:04.200
We are more than friends.

23:04.234 --> 23:06.367
We're in love,

23:06.401 --> 23:08.467
and have been for almost a year.

23:12.267 --> 23:15.267
You've been carrying on
with this man

23:15.301 --> 23:17.534
behind my back?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.400
You say that to me,

23:19.401 --> 23:21.367
after driving mother away
with your infidelity.

23:25.100 --> 23:27.067
Please, Father.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.067
Don't let Uncle Farhad's
betrayal

23:29.100 --> 23:30.600
turn you against everyone

23:30.601 --> 23:33.567
who cares about you.

23:33.601 --> 23:36.567
I can't think of a better way

23:36.601 --> 23:39.567
to completely infiltrate my life
and influence my judgment

23:39.601 --> 23:42.434
than getting close
to my daughter.

23:42.467 --> 23:44.534
It's not like that.

23:44.567 --> 23:46.867
You're not to see that man
again, ever.

23:46.900 --> 23:48.600
Father...

23:48.601 --> 23:49.966
I'm done with
this conversation.

23:49.967 --> 23:51.933
I need to get back to my work.

23:54.401 --> 23:56.401
What's happening to you?

25:19.701 --> 25:22.034
Come on.

25:23.701 --> 25:25.701
Damn it!

25:30.434 --> 25:33.434
I am holding the rods
until Meier comes clean

25:33.467 --> 25:34.966
about how he knew
of the transfer.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.134
If what Meier said is true about
the leak in Farhad's team,

25:38.167 --> 25:39.566
it will be dangerous for us.

25:39.567 --> 25:41.900
So we must unload the
rods, finish this.

25:41.933 --> 25:44.167
Let them be someone
else's problem...

25:44.200 --> 25:46.334
And we erase any evidence.

25:46.367 --> 25:49.467
Once Dimitri is finished,
and I'm satisfied

25:49.501 --> 25:50.733
the German is telling the truth,

25:50.734 --> 25:52.533
I'm going to want
to hand off the rods

25:52.534 --> 25:55.301
to Farhad tonight.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.734
Keep your men out of sight
along the perimeter.

26:06.768 --> 26:09.734
Mikhail and his men will stay
with the cargo.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.800
Check to see if the rest
of the street lost power.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.367
Just us.

26:24.401 --> 26:26.668
It's Meier.

26:26.701 --> 26:28.668
Cover the exits.

26:31.701 --> 26:34.334
Check the fuse box.

27:22.701 --> 27:24.701
Come on.

27:27.301 --> 27:29.066
CTU. O'Brian.

27:29.067 --> 27:30.266
Chloe. It's Jack.

27:30.267 --> 27:31.600
Jack, everyone's
been looking for you.

27:31.601 --> 27:32.600
Where are you?

27:32.601 --> 27:33.767
I need you to trace this call

27:33.768 --> 27:34.932
and send
a Tac team immediately.

27:34.933 --> 27:36.600
Jack? Chloe, just
trace the call.

27:36.601 --> 27:38.501
Jack!

27:51.301 --> 27:53.234
*

29:20.334 --> 29:23.701
We're sure NYPD's got
the perimeter locked down?

29:23.734 --> 29:26.100
The restaurant and everything
in a block radius is secure.

29:26.134 --> 29:30.000
Our response team
will be there soon.

29:30.034 --> 29:31.366
Where's Dana?

29:31.367 --> 29:33.401
She logged out of the building
about 15 minutes ago.

29:33.434 --> 29:35.534
Something about
fixing a faulty relay

29:35.567 --> 29:37.099
at our 17th Street station.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.200
Why didn't she just have
IP maintenance take care of it?

29:39.234 --> 29:40.600
Good question.

29:40.601 --> 29:43.200
She had to manually reboot
the firmware herself.

29:43.234 --> 29:45.668
That's what she said anyway.

29:45.701 --> 29:48.234
Where are we
with this man Bazhaev?

29:48.267 --> 29:49.500
It's coming
through right now.

29:49.501 --> 29:51.534
I've cross-accessed
interagency servers,

29:51.567 --> 29:53.734
also Interpol and FSB.

29:53.768 --> 29:55.166
I'm relaying intel
as it comes in

29:55.167 --> 29:57.301
to our response team
and to Jack.

29:57.334 --> 29:59.234
Good. Put it up on screen.

30:00.434 --> 30:03.200
Okay, people.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.467
We've ID'd the suspect
we have in custody.

30:05.501 --> 30:09.467
His name
is Sergei Petrovich Bazhaev,

30:09.501 --> 30:11.933
Ukrainian national,
61 years of age.

30:11.967 --> 30:13.633
Now, we believe
he knows the location

30:13.634 --> 30:15.500
of the unsecured nuclear rods.

30:15.501 --> 30:18.000
Now, tactical is on its way
to transport him back here

30:18.034 --> 30:19.400
for interrogation.

30:19.401 --> 30:22.234
Agent Ortiz will coordinate
operations from here.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.301
Is it true?
You found Jack?

30:35.334 --> 30:37.234
Yeah. He's okay.

30:39.567 --> 30:40.999
If you're finished
with your statement,

30:41.000 --> 30:42.466
I need to take you
to medical.

30:42.467 --> 30:45.100
No. No. I want to be here
when Jack gets back.

30:45.134 --> 30:46.600
I'll let him know
where to find you.

30:46.601 --> 30:48.900
Come on.

30:48.933 --> 30:51.200
Mr. Bauer, this should
hold you for now.

30:51.234 --> 30:52.799
But you're going to have
to go to the hospital.

30:52.800 --> 30:54.266
Okay.
Excuse me, sir.

30:54.267 --> 30:56.167
They uploaded
the suspect's file right now.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.134
How far out is CTU?

31:02.167 --> 31:03.966
They're about five
minutes out.

31:03.967 --> 31:05.867
It's all right.
I got it. Thanks.

31:20.534 --> 31:21.866
Sergeant?

31:21.867 --> 31:24.768
I need to speak
with this man alone.

31:34.567 --> 31:36.701
I knew you were a cop.

31:36.734 --> 31:38.199
I should have
trusted my instincts

31:38.200 --> 31:39.433
and killed you on the spot.

31:39.434 --> 31:43.501
Well, you can add it
to your list of regrets.

31:43.534 --> 31:46.134
CTU's already acquired a
great deal of intel on you,

31:46.167 --> 31:49.967
Mr. Bazhaev.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.668
It's over. You
know that, right?

31:52.701 --> 31:54.601
You're finished.

31:56.167 --> 31:58.067
I mean, at the very
least, we've got you

31:58.100 --> 31:59.366
on kidnapping and murder,
and that's before

31:59.367 --> 32:01.467
CTU rips this place apart
and uncovers the rest

32:01.501 --> 32:03.933
of your criminal activity.

32:03.967 --> 32:07.668
Lucky for you, though, I'm
only interested in one thing,

32:07.701 --> 32:10.434
and that's the acquisition
of those fuel rods.

32:10.467 --> 32:13.701
So, if you were
to cooperate,

32:13.734 --> 32:16.701
help me out there,

32:16.734 --> 32:18.933
that would go a
long way to reducing

32:18.967 --> 32:21.800
what is clearly going to be
a very long prison sentence.

32:23.668 --> 32:27.100
That offer extends to
both of your sons, too-

32:27.134 --> 32:29.167
Josef and Oleg.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.067
Oleg is dead.

32:33.100 --> 32:36.067
He was exposed
to the rods.

32:36.100 --> 32:39.200
Became ill with
radiation poisoning.

32:39.234 --> 32:41.534
He was suffering,

32:41.567 --> 32:44.734
and I shot him,

32:44.768 --> 32:48.267
as if he was
just a sick dog.

32:50.833 --> 32:52.833
I murdered my own son.

32:54.933 --> 32:56.900
For nothing.

33:07.067 --> 33:09.534
You want to know
where the rods are?

33:09.567 --> 33:11.333
I will tell you.

33:11.334 --> 33:12.767
But I want full immunity.

33:12.768 --> 33:15.567
Not just for me,
but for my other son, Josef.

33:15.601 --> 33:17.668
I don't think
I can make that happen.

33:17.701 --> 33:19.668
Then we have nothing
to talk about.

33:33.167 --> 33:35.167
I'll see what I can do.

33:40.768 --> 33:44.167
CTU. O'Brian.

33:44.200 --> 33:45.366
Chloe, it's Jack.

33:45.367 --> 33:46.832
I need to speak
with Hastings.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.200
I think he's in the middle of a
briefing with President Taylor.

33:49.234 --> 33:51.234
Even better. See if you
can patch me in, okay?

33:51.267 --> 33:53.133
Okay.

33:53.134 --> 33:56.034
Mr. Hastings, it's Farhad Hassan
I'm worried about.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.233
How do we know
he hasn't acquired

33:57.234 --> 33:58.433
the rods already?

33:58.434 --> 34:00.300
Based on the intel we have,
the transfer hasn't

34:00.301 --> 34:01.600
taken place yet.

34:01.601 --> 34:03.466
Madam President,
excuse the interruption.

34:03.467 --> 34:04.633
Jack Bauer is on the line.

34:04.634 --> 34:05.799
He wishes to be conferenced in.

34:05.800 --> 34:06.966
Put him through.

34:06.967 --> 34:08.199
Jack, it's President Taylor.

34:08.199 --> 34:09.632
You're on with Mr. Hastings

34:09.634 --> 34:11.132
and my chief of staff.

34:11.134 --> 34:14.434
CTU's been keeping me apprised
of your involvement in this.

34:14.467 --> 34:16.900
I'm sorry that it's taken
this long for us to speak.

34:16.933 --> 34:18.266
I understand, and
please forgive me

34:18.266 --> 34:19.600
for getting straight
to the point,

34:19.601 --> 34:21.466
but the man that
we have in custody,

34:21.467 --> 34:22.866
Sergei Bazhaev, is
willing to cooperate.

34:22.867 --> 34:24.967
He said he would hand
over the fuel rods

34:25.000 --> 34:26.933
in exchange for full
immunity for him and his son.

34:26.967 --> 34:28.199
Is that all?

34:28.199 --> 34:30.134
Why don't me give him a parade
down Broadway, too?

34:30.167 --> 34:31.500
Jack, you've been dealing
with this man.

34:31.501 --> 34:33.199
Is there no other way
to get the location

34:33.199 --> 34:34.533
of the nuclear
materials out of him?

34:34.534 --> 34:35.766
It says in his files

34:35.768 --> 34:37.668
that he did 12 years
in a Russian labor camp.

34:37.701 --> 34:39.433
In the time frame
that we have,

34:39.434 --> 34:41.800
we're not gonna break him,
Madam President.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.466
I can see it in his eyes.

34:43.467 --> 34:45.534
Mr. Hastings, what
is your assessment?

34:45.567 --> 34:48.734
Well, at first blush, I'd say
an immunity deal is premature,

34:48.768 --> 34:50.266
but under the circumstances,

34:50.266 --> 34:52.900
I'll defer
to Jack's judgment on this.

34:52.933 --> 34:55.768
Gentlemen, I have a peace deal
that's going to fall apart

34:55.800 --> 34:58.367
at any moment unless I
can show President Hassan

34:58.401 --> 34:59.966
that we have
stopped his brother

34:59.967 --> 35:02.668
from smuggling those fuel
rods out of the country.

35:02.701 --> 35:05.434
Make the deal, Jack.

35:05.467 --> 35:07.199
Madam President, he's going
to want this in writing.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.366
He'll get it.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.933
But in the interests
of expediency,

35:10.967 --> 35:12.466
put him on the phone with me.

35:12.467 --> 35:14.434
Yes, ma'am.

35:16.301 --> 35:18.234
The President
of the United States

35:18.267 --> 35:20.167
wants to talk to you.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.267
You want to tell me
what's going on?

35:34.301 --> 35:36.166
What are you talking about?

35:36.167 --> 35:37.266
You were implying something
about Dana,

35:37.267 --> 35:38.767
and I want to know what it is.

35:38.768 --> 35:41.301
When she came over before
and said

35:41.334 --> 35:44.267
she had to talk to you,
what did she tell you?

35:44.301 --> 35:45.566
Nothing.

35:45.567 --> 35:47.133
She said she had a problem,
and she'd handle it.

35:47.134 --> 35:48.300
That's it?

35:48.301 --> 35:49.999
Arlo, if you know something...

35:50.000 --> 35:51.266
Okay, look,

35:51.267 --> 35:53.167
it's none of my business,

35:53.200 --> 35:56.100
and I didn't want to be the one
to tell you this,

35:56.134 --> 35:58.301
but I think she went
to meet some guy.

36:01.567 --> 36:03.300
You're out of your mind.

36:03.301 --> 36:05.634
Take a look at this.

36:09.867 --> 36:11.033
Who is he?

36:11.034 --> 36:12.333
I checked with the gate.

36:12.334 --> 36:14.833
They said his name
is Kevin Wade.

36:14.867 --> 36:16.767
Identified himself as a friend.

36:17.800 --> 36:20.434
Okay, so he's a friend.

36:32.534 --> 36:34.534
Cole?

36:34.567 --> 36:37.701
Bazhaev's given up the location
of the nuclear rods.

36:37.734 --> 36:39.366
I've already scrambled
a NEST team.

36:39.367 --> 36:41.267
Meet your tactical unit

36:41.301 --> 36:42.466
at the helipad.

36:42.467 --> 36:44.199
The coordinates will be relayed
to you en route.

36:44.200 --> 36:45.832
Yes, sir.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.768
You think you can find her?

36:47.800 --> 36:50.434
I could if all the drones
weren't already committed.

36:50.467 --> 36:52.367
What about a cell trace?

36:53.833 --> 36:55.833
Just do it.

37:25.200 --> 37:27.933
I don't know where you are
or what you're doing, Dana,

37:27.967 --> 37:30.467
but I need you to call me
as soon as you get this.

37:30.501 --> 37:31.832
It's important.

37:31.833 --> 37:33.733
I love you.

37:41.401 --> 37:42.700
Thank you, sir.

37:42.701 --> 37:43.733
Sorry.

37:43.734 --> 37:45.634
Don't worry about it.

38:03.834 --> 38:04.899
Miss Kayla, no.

38:04.900 --> 38:06.166
Get out of my way, Nabeel.

38:06.167 --> 38:07.400
I want to see him.

38:07.401 --> 38:09.301
Your father forbids it.

38:10.734 --> 38:13.368
I'm sorry.
I'm just doing my job.

38:13.401 --> 38:15.233
A job that Tarin gave you.

38:15.234 --> 38:17.100
He brought you
into my father's

38:17.101 --> 38:19.468
security detail,
and this is how you repay him?

38:21.567 --> 38:23.533
You're his friend, Nabeel.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.467
You know he's innocent.

38:25.468 --> 38:27.800
What would you have me do?

38:27.834 --> 38:29.632
Just let me speak to him.

38:29.633 --> 38:31.600
A few minutes is all I ask.

38:31.633 --> 38:34.167
I can't let you in now.

38:34.201 --> 38:36.867
Tarin's going to be readied
for transport

38:36.900 --> 38:38.400
to our embassy in an hour.

38:38.401 --> 38:41.401
I will find a moment
you can see him before then.

38:41.434 --> 38:43.967
Thank you, Nabeel.

38:44.001 --> 38:47.134
Now go before we're both
in trouble.

38:55.967 --> 39:00.301
Cole, the NEST team's ETA is
two minutes from target site.

39:00.334 --> 39:04.201
Now the HAZMAT crew will wait
for your signal to move in.

39:04.234 --> 39:05.833
Be advised the truck with

39:05.834 --> 39:09.034
the fuel rods is being guarded
by two armed hostiles.

39:09.067 --> 39:11.567
Command, we have an immunity
deal with their boss.

39:11.600 --> 39:13.533
Why haven't they been ordered
to stand down?

39:13.567 --> 39:17.267
Well, Jack's understanding is
that these men are hard cases.

39:17.301 --> 39:18.733
They won't roll over easily.

39:18.734 --> 39:21.633
We cannot take the risk that
they'll flee with the rods.

39:21.667 --> 39:22.699
Understood.

39:22.700 --> 39:23.866
Now, when you secure

39:23.867 --> 39:25.133
the nuclear materials,

39:25.134 --> 39:26.899
you'll transport them
to Fort Hamilton.

39:26.900 --> 39:29.234
We're clearing that air corridor
as we speak.

39:33.734 --> 39:35.000
Command, we
see the truck,

39:35.001 --> 39:36.934
but there's no
sign of hostiles.

39:36.967 --> 39:38.532
Approaching the weigh
station now. Stand by.

39:38.533 --> 39:40.800
Set us down there.

40:07.533 --> 40:09.200
Picking up trace radiation.

40:09.201 --> 40:11.500
30 millirads. It's safe.

40:11.533 --> 40:13.433
Go, go. Move in.

40:35.800 --> 40:37.700
We're clear.

40:45.633 --> 40:47.567
Command, are you seeing this?

40:47.600 --> 40:49.200
I am.

40:49.201 --> 40:51.234
Where the hell are the rods?

40:51.267 --> 40:53.800
We picked up trace
radiation signatures.

40:53.834 --> 40:55.233
The rods were here.

40:55.234 --> 40:57.767
Right now all we have
are two bodies, both shot.

40:57.800 --> 40:59.934
Hey, Agent Ortiz.

41:24.667 --> 41:27.867
Come on, man,
you can have a good time.

41:27.900 --> 41:30.034
It's okay. It's okay to laugh
once in a while.

41:30.067 --> 41:31.967
You can be a happy person.

41:39.234 --> 41:40.433
This is Bauer.

41:40.434 --> 41:41.532
It's Hastings.

41:41.533 --> 41:42.933
Our team's at the truck stop.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.166
The nuclear rods are not there.

41:44.167 --> 41:47.267
What? H-Hold on. Say that again.

41:47.301 --> 41:50.834
I said the rods
are not there.

41:50.867 --> 41:51.899
That's not possible.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.367
Did your men go
to the right place?

41:53.368 --> 41:54.766
They went exactly where
you sent them.

41:54.767 --> 41:56.934
Now stop playing games
and tell us where the rods are.

41:56.967 --> 41:59.468
I told you, they were there.

41:59.500 --> 42:01.166
I had two
of my men guarding them.

42:01.167 --> 42:02.833
We found their bodies,
both shot.

42:02.834 --> 42:04.066
And there was something else.

42:04.067 --> 42:05.532
Some kind
of necklace hanging

42:05.533 --> 42:07.233
on the inside
of the truck's door.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.899
Like someone wanted
to send a message.

42:08.900 --> 42:10.800
What kind of a necklace?

42:10.800 --> 42:12.767
A gold cross.

42:14.167 --> 42:16.500
What does that mean?

42:18.301 --> 42:20.201
Josef.

42:24.301 --> 42:25.632
I have the fuel rods.

42:25.633 --> 42:28.301
Really?

42:28.334 --> 42:29.666
I wasn't sure I believed, Josef,

42:29.667 --> 42:31.166
that you would betray
your father.

42:31.167 --> 42:33.434
You were upset that he was
holding up delivery

42:33.468 --> 42:35.633
of the rods;
now I've gotten them for you.

42:35.667 --> 42:37.767
It won't take him long
to realize what's happened,

42:37.800 --> 42:39.100
so let's get
this done fast.

42:39.101 --> 42:40.200
You're worried
he'll discover

42:40.201 --> 42:41.566
you've replaced him
as our partner.

42:41.567 --> 42:44.567
No, I want my father to know.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.834
In fact,
I made sure he will.

42:46.867 --> 42:48.333
When will you get here?

42:48.334 --> 42:49.966
Less than five minutes.

42:49.967 --> 42:52.067
Just have my money ready.
