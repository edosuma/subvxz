00:13.430 --> 00:15.307
Merry Christmas.

00:17.184 --> 00:20.020
Oh, my Santa.

00:22.481 --> 00:27.069
Guys, I worked 60 hours this week.
It's four o'clock on Christmas Eve,

00:27.194 --> 00:29.863
and you still haven't gotten
the house Christmas-ready?

00:29.947 --> 00:33.492
-Come on. Work with me.
-You said, "Get in the Christmas spirit,"

00:33.575 --> 00:36.954
so we're watching the most heartwarming
Christmas movie ever made -

00:37.037 --> 00:38.038
<i>Die Hard.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:41.250
<i>Die Hard?</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:44.711
-"Yippee-ki-yay, moth--"
-Hey, don't finish that thought.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.633
Oh, come on, people.

00:49.716 --> 00:52.678
I don't smell cookies. I don't see tinsel.

00:52.761 --> 00:56.098
I haven't checked the halls,
but I am assuming they are not decked.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.644
Mother, I tried, but they just don't have
the Christmas spirit

01:00.727 --> 01:01.979
like you, me, and Tommy.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.273
None of these lollygaggers
moved a muscle.

01:04.356 --> 01:07.442
They refused to hang the stockings
with or without care.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.736
[machine guns firing]

01:09.820 --> 01:12.614
Ooh, <i>Die Hard.</i>
Now it feels like Christmas.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.576
Oh.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.956
See what I've been working with?

01:23.333 --> 01:26.962
Oh, I knew I could count on Kimmy
for some Christmas spirit.

01:27.045 --> 01:29.131
Are you gonna put out presents?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.466
Not unless someone wants
my sweaty gym socks.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.011
This is my laundry bag.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.014
Okay, that's it.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.140
[shuts off TV]

01:38.223 --> 01:40.726
-Wait!
-Mom!

01:40.809 --> 01:43.604
With Dad, Uncle Jesse,
and Aunt Becky visiting Michelle,

01:43.687 --> 01:45.814
I was counting on you guys.

01:45.897 --> 01:48.191
You are all on my naughty list.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.611
You're not gonna tell Santa, are you?

01:52.029 --> 01:53.655
There's no option off the table.

01:53.739 --> 01:55.407
I'm gonna see him in 45 minutes

01:55.490 --> 01:58.118
because I am taking
Max and Tommy to the mall.

01:58.201 --> 02:01.705
And when I get back, this room
better be filled with so many Santas,

02:01.788 --> 02:04.750
I couldn't even swing
a red-nosed reindeer without hitting one.

02:06.001 --> 02:09.087
There's no time for relaxation, people.
It's Christmas!

02:12.591 --> 02:14.384
I should probably take Tommy.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.305
[door closes]

02:18.388 --> 02:19.973
-Aw...
-Ohh...

02:20.057 --> 02:22.517
-All right.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.310
Kimmy, what are you doing?

03:47.394 --> 03:51.106
Duh. I'm leaning over the railing
in a dangerous fashion.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.152
No, no, no. You can't do that.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.863
You're pregnant with my baby.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.823
Why do I keep forgetting that?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.537
I really should look down more often.

04:08.165 --> 04:11.042
Whoa, did you double in size overnight?

04:11.126 --> 04:14.337
Sure did. Second trimester started today.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.842
When we Gibblers pop, we blow up
like a tick on a water buffalo.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.513
Pregnant Gibblers
also have heightened senses,

04:23.597 --> 04:28.018
but not the normal ones, like throwing up
when you smell chicken or library books.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.146

That jerk Paul Revere took all the credit
'cause she was too fat to get on a horse.

04:43.867 --> 04:46.244
Hey, what are you doing
with all these old clothes?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.997
Oh, I am collecting donations
for the homeless shelter.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.583
I'm volunteering there
for school community service.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.795
Wow. That's so cool
your school makes you do that.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.923
You know we go to the same school?

05:00.592 --> 05:01.843
I hear DJ coming.

05:01.927 --> 05:05.013
Now, there's someone
with the Christmas spirit.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.015
Quick, get rid of all the Santas.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.521
You mean the hundred Santas
that you asked us to put up?

05:12.604 --> 05:14.606
Don't use my words against me.

05:15.941 --> 05:19.528
Tommy is suddenly terrified of Santa.
He had a meltdown at the mall.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.446
It couldn't have been that bad.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.910
SANTA AND ME

05:26.993 --> 05:28.745
-Yeesh.
-Yeesh.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.289
You know, it's funny,

05:31.373 --> 05:34.042
I have that same picture of me
on Russell Brand's lap.

05:35.794 --> 05:36.628
Don't ask.

05:42.384 --> 05:44.469
Hey, Max. How did you like Santa?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.346
It was terrific.

05:51.518 --> 05:55.230
I'm no linguist, but it's almost like
he was saying it wasn't terrific.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.735
But Max is Mr. Christmas.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.863
Not anymore.

06:02.946 --> 06:06.157
I mean, he was fine
until we got in line to meet Santa,

06:06.241 --> 06:09.369
and then he suddenly announced
that he was over Christmas.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.955
-What happened?
-I don't know.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.624
He just left the line
and spent the next four hours

06:14.708 --> 06:17.586
in a massage chair at Brookstone
eating Korean BBQ.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.715
That sounds like the best Christmas ever.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.302
It does, doesn't it?

06:26.678 --> 06:30.974
Oh, but instead, I've got two kids
who have gone full Grinch on me

06:31.057 --> 06:33.435
and a boyfriend
who won't be here for Christmas.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.772
Well, at least Steve
left you that sweet voice mail.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.025
Yeah, it was sweet. I miss--

06:40.108 --> 06:42.736
Wait. How did you know
about the voice mail?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.906
I just listened to it in the car.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
My Gibbler pregnancy hearing.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.829
Wait. You didn't hear anything else,
did you?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.166
Of course not... Boo Bear.

07:03.590 --> 07:05.175
Hey, Rocki,

07:05.258 --> 07:07.093
it's me again.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.055
When you get this, give me a holla. Holla!

07:11.932 --> 07:14.309
I've left her five messages
and haven't heard back.

07:14.392 --> 07:16.519
Maybe she can't hear you
over that sweater.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.860
Oh, wait, wait. No, Kimmy.
Here... let me help you with that.

07:24.694 --> 07:28.907
Here we go. The milk, the cookie...
Tiny bite. Okay.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.953
You gonna be like this
the whole pregnancy?

07:33.036 --> 07:37.499
No. I, like your pregnancy,
am going to get worse as time goes on.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.505
Santa cookies, no. You have to
get rid of those before Tommy sees them.

07:43.588 --> 07:45.298
No problem.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.441
Why didn't you just hide them?

08:04.901 --> 08:06.069
I didn't each lunch.

08:12.951 --> 08:16.413
I just-- I don't understand
why Tommy's so afraid of Santa.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.165
Maybe it's because Santa
is a bearded stranger

08:19.249 --> 08:21.835
who breaks into your house
and steals your milk.

08:24.713 --> 08:29.300
Or he's a jolly, magical friend
who brings you presents.

08:29.384 --> 08:33.471
Only after he passes judgment on you
in a punitive fashion.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.935
Oh. Sounds like somebody's
got a case of the bah humbugs.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.355
Hey. Max, what's going on?

08:42.439 --> 08:46.317
You're usually my Christmas hype man,
spreading Yuletide cheer.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.236
That's the old me.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.947
I'm too mature
for all this Christmas nonsense.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.491
Wha--Wha...

08:53.575 --> 08:56.745
[hyperventilates]

08:56.828 --> 08:59.664
Too mature for Christmas?

09:00.165 --> 09:01.791
There's no such thing.

09:02.917 --> 09:06.337
Does anybody got a crayon?
I got to finish my letter for Santee.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.555
Hey, Steve. Just leaving you
another voice mail.

09:15.638 --> 09:19.309
You're probably doing Lakers stuff.
We'll be watching the game tonight.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.396
So, hopefully someone will roll an ankle,
and we'll get to see you on TV.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.400
And, Kimmy, if you are super-listening,
please stop.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.195
Sure thing, Boo Bear.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.490
Bye, honey.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.702
Got your text. What's up?

09:38.411 --> 09:43.166
What's up is that it's Christmas Eve,
your favorite day of the year,

09:43.249 --> 09:45.877
and that includes the season premiere
of <i>Blue Bloods.</i>

09:48.713 --> 09:50.381
Told you. That's old Max.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.218
Well, I miss old Max.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.844
Everyone does.

09:54.928 --> 09:58.348
And that is why we are going to do
everything we can

09:58.431 --> 10:02.310
to get you back into the Christmas spirit,
Fuller style.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.065
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:07.148 --> 10:12.362
I present to you
the Fuller Family Holiday Extravaganza.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.830
That's sort of not fair since you know
how much I love an extravaganza.

10:21.913 --> 10:25.125
Wait. Hold on.
Lady with a baby coming through.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.587
Let the cavalcade begin.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.214
It's an extravaganza.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.550
Oh. Well, then I want my money back.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.471
First up in our pageant
of Christmas cheer--

10:38.555 --> 10:40.974
Oh, wait. It's a pageant?
Oh, then keep my money.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.852
You know him.
You love him. It's...

10:43.935 --> 10:45.770
Tommy Jr.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.355
Yeah, Tommy!

10:49.315 --> 10:50.984
Here's your paper, sir.

10:52.235 --> 10:53.903
Thanks, Tommy,

10:53.987 --> 10:57.365
but by now, all the Japanese markets
have already closed.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.953
Tough crowd, Tommy. Okay.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.581
All right, next up -

11:05.248 --> 11:08.835
he has a heart of gold and abs of steel.

11:08.918 --> 11:13.464
You know him
as Jeremiah Jeff Coat Johnson,

11:13.590 --> 11:14.924
Jimmy Gibbler.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.718
Yeah, Jimmy.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.147
Does anybody else taste pennies?

11:31.232 --> 11:36.154
[stammers] I appreciate the effort,

11:36.237 --> 11:39.115
but how is this supposed to
get me in the Christmas spirit?

11:40.575 --> 11:43.077
Don't know.
He was supposed to sing "Jingle Bells."

11:47.498 --> 11:52.462
Max, honey. I don't know
what's upsetting you, but we're a family,

11:52.545 --> 11:56.507
and none of us can have a happy Christmas
unless you have a happy Christmas.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.011
Will you at least help us
finish decorating the tree?

12:01.012 --> 12:02.263
Sure.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.306
Okay.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.142
-Come on. Grab an ornament.
-Here. Let's decorate.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.227
Here we go.

12:07.936 --> 12:08.978
Here you go, Max.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.822
Oh, no.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.913
I know what this is about.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.839
Knock-knock.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.591
I'm not here.

12:38.675 --> 12:42.679
Max, I think we should talk
about what's upsetting you.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.391
Who says I'm upset?

12:47.433 --> 12:49.394
A house full of people who love you.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.898
I think I know what's bothering you.

12:56.818 --> 12:57.819
You do?

12:58.695 --> 12:59.696
Yeah.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.492
Because I used to have similar feelings
around the holidays.

13:06.911 --> 13:09.664
I miss my dad. I miss him so much.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.084
Oh, honey, I miss him, too.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.920
Every day so much.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.215
Today, at the mall...

13:20.049 --> 13:23.678
we were in line for Santa,
and I kept seeing kids with their dads.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.972
Yeah, that made you sad?

13:27.223 --> 13:30.935
I see kids with their dads all the time,
but it never made me sad before.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.024
And then today,
it just hit me out of nowhere.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.694
Yeah, that's what grief is like.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.740
It just has a way of sneaking up on you.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.744
But why did it have to pick Christmas Eve?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.873
Why couldn't it have been
Jackson's birthday?

13:55.960 --> 13:56.919
You know, Max...

13:59.047 --> 14:03.092
when I was your age,
I lost my mom, your grandma.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.971
And the holidays were always so hard

14:07.055 --> 14:10.475
because they're supposed to be
about fun and celebration.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.979
But sometimes, they just kind of
left a hole in my heart.

14:16.439 --> 14:17.482
So what'd you do?

14:19.484 --> 14:20.318
Well...

14:21.819 --> 14:24.572
there was one thing
that Grandpa Danny would do for me

14:24.655 --> 14:26.032
when I was missing my mom.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.788
He would show me home movies of her
to help me remember her.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.083
It was almost like she was there.

14:36.334 --> 14:37.585
That must have been nice.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.545
Yeah, it was.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.342
Honey, do you want to watch movies
of you and your dad?

14:45.134 --> 14:48.596
I know it's something you've been
having trouble letting yourself do.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.642
I think I'd like that.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.319
I'm proud of you for spending
your Christmas Eve helping others.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.322
Thanks. You know, I know it started
as a school assignment,

15:06.406 --> 15:08.616
but it made me realize
how fortunate we are.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.368
I like giving back.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.578
Maybe I'll do it more often.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.289
I'm so glad you feel that way.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.625
But I still want my scarf back.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.712
Here, you can have this sweater.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.507
-Isn't that Stephanie's?
-Sure is.

15:28.636 --> 15:30.763
Oh, Kimmy. There you are.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.390
Can I make you a snack?

15:32.473 --> 15:33.933
Oh, I'm not hungry.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.602
Yeah, but the baby is, right? And...

15:36.686 --> 15:40.189
if the baby is anything like me,
which it will be, because it's mine,

15:40.273 --> 15:43.067
its favorite food is going to be
tableside guacamole.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.113
Steph, stop. I'm really not hungry.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.031
I know what you need.

15:49.615 --> 15:52.243
According to all my baby books
and Winnie-the-Pooh,

15:52.326 --> 15:54.412
everyone loves a belly rub.

15:54.996 --> 15:58.624
Okay, you really need to stop.
Oh. But that does feel good.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.795
Whatever you do, don't stop.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.218
I never thought I would mind
Stephanie Tanner doting on me.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.762
But why are you doing this?

16:11.846 --> 16:14.974
Because... I feel grateful.

16:16.434 --> 16:17.518
And a little guilty.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.606
It's my baby,
but you're doing all the work.

16:23.149 --> 16:26.110
I know I shouldn't,
but sometimes I feel inadequate.

16:27.445 --> 16:30.740
First of all, no one with those hands
should ever feel inadequate.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.914
And besides, Steph, you're my partner
every step of the way.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.750
I just wanna be involved.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.460
I mean, the truth is, I've...

16:42.710 --> 16:45.129
never had my friend carry my baby before.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.674
You called me your friend?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.095
I've waited 30 years to hear that.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.600
I should have had your baby
in middle school.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.566
Ladies, we wanted to give you
a special gift

17:05.650 --> 17:09.153
so that you'll always have something
to remember your pregnancy.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.988
Well, there will be a baby.

17:12.782 --> 17:17.954
But... until that time,
enjoy this token of our appreciation

17:18.037 --> 17:20.164
from the baby daddies
to the baby mamas.

17:21.832 --> 17:24.460
-We went halfsies on it.
-Halfsies.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.463
I have not received a PayPal.

17:31.425 --> 17:33.052
[both] Aw!

17:33.636 --> 17:35.930
It's our first baby picture.

17:36.180 --> 17:38.933
Don't worry. When the baby comes out,
it'll be in color.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.693
Oh, Max, look how cute you were.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.153
<i>Okay, everyone, give me a wave.</i>

17:51.237 --> 17:53.489

<i>-Merry Christmas!</i>

17:59.870 --> 18:01.163
I miss Dad, too.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.543
I miss when you knew
how to frame a shot.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.549
There's the Max we love.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.517
<i>Hey, Mom. Wha-- No. Hold on.</i>

18:28.024 --> 18:29.317
Mom, are you all right?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.528
It must be the hormones.
I'm feeling it, too.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.995
Feeling better, Max?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.496
I am.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.582
Man, was I cute.

18:49.712 --> 18:50.921
Kimmy, what's going on?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.843
You know in the video when Tommy Sr.
took the phone call and...

18:55.926 --> 18:57.386
none of you could hear it?

18:58.012 --> 19:00.556
Well, I could with my Gibbler hearing.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.519
Tommy wanted to give his kids
the best Christmas ever.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.857
He even bought these special presents
and hid them here at Danny's house.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.526
I had no idea.

19:13.611 --> 19:16.030
They were in that weird cabinet
above the washer.

19:16.739 --> 19:17.990
It's a Christmas miracle.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.868
Wait. We have a washer?

19:29.835 --> 19:34.131
Tommy, it's just like the one I broke.
Be careful, little man.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.969
Wow, a Wii U.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.806
That's exactly what I wanted
when they still made them.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.728
It's a watch.

19:48.729 --> 19:51.440
It's just like the one Dad used to wear.

19:53.401 --> 19:54.402
It's perfect.

19:55.611 --> 19:58.030
Well, since I'm passing out
Christmas miracles...

19:59.240 --> 20:00.950
he left one for you, too.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.667
"Merry Christmas, my beloved wife.

20:10.626 --> 20:13.170
All I ever want is for you to be happy

20:13.921 --> 20:15.297
each and every day.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.841
Love, Tommy."

20:23.472 --> 20:25.391
It's so ugly.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.147
Oh.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.986
Oh, he always had such awful taste.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.447
I love it.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.618
Thanks, Mom.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.664
Maybe I'm not too immature
for the holidays.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.792
Welcome back, Mr. Christmas.

20:53.794 --> 20:56.046
[indistinct chatter]

20:56.130 --> 20:58.299
Okay. Well, normally on Christmas Eve,

20:58.382 --> 21:01.927
my dad would be up here
giving some long-winded speech

21:02.011 --> 21:04.764
about an obscure relative
we've never heard of or met.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.768
So if he asks, just tell him I did that.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.812
[all] Hear, hear!

21:11.896 --> 21:12.897
Good story.

21:16.192 --> 21:18.903
But I do wanna say
how truly grateful I am

21:18.986 --> 21:21.447
that we're all able
to spend the holiday together.

21:21.530 --> 21:22.948
[cell phone beeps]

21:23.032 --> 21:25.785
Oh, hey, Jackson.
I said no phones at the table.

21:26.368 --> 21:29.288
It's okay, Mom.
It's another Christmas miracle.

21:29.371 --> 21:30.831
Rocki just texted me back.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.920
She said "holla."

21:38.672 --> 21:41.675
People are throwing the word "miracle"
around pretty loosely.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.804
So where was I?

21:45.846 --> 21:47.431
We are truly blessed.

21:47.515 --> 21:51.018
-[bells jingle]
-Santa. Santa.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.564
Oh, no.
I hope we didn't miss another Santa.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.192
Ho ho ho!

22:03.906 --> 22:07.117
Merry Christmas!

22:07.201 --> 22:08.285
It's Santa!

22:11.247 --> 22:14.083
-Hey, Joey!
-Hi, Joey!

22:14.166 --> 22:16.418
Oh, yeah, Joey, right.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.753
Of course, it's Joey.

22:20.548 --> 22:24.218
Aw, Tommy.
You're not afraid of Santa anymore.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.719
I love Santa Joey.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.596
Aw.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.431
Joey, what are you doing here?

22:29.515 --> 22:33.352
Well, a couple of Santa's elves
named Jackson and Ramona

22:33.435 --> 22:38.524
texted me and said that someone here
was afraid of Old Saint Nick.

22:39.108 --> 22:42.695

Great.

We were about to have
Christmas Eve dinner.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.882
Well, you know me. I'm never one
to turn down a free turkey leg.

Oh, look, there's one right there.

As I was saying...

That's not that romantic.

I quit. Kind of. If Magic Johnson calls,
don't tell him I'm here.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.660
You quit? But that's your dream job.

24:12.743 --> 24:15.621
Yeah, but I have dreams
that are more important than that.
