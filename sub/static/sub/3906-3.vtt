14:52.200 --> 14:53.440
Hold on, hold...

14:53.520 --> 14:57.002
I'm not going to kick this little girl out on the street.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.970
You can spend another night if it helps you out.

14:59.480 --> 15:01.084
- All right?
- Thank you.

15:01.160 --> 15:02.685

15:32.880 --> 15:34.609
- Alison.
- Hmm.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.881
Let's save that beautiful instrument
for the audience. Okay?

15:40.600 --> 15:45.970
Guys, let's just do the dialogue.
Okay? Dialogue only.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.082
Holy! Fiddlesticks.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.640
Sorry. Sorry, I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to startle you.

16:00.720 --> 16:04.167
Um, I'm locked out of my car.
My phone's inside.

16:04.240 --> 16:06.004
Can I borrow yours to call my husband at the office?

16:06.240 --> 16:08.288
Oh, yeah. Um...

16:08.360 --> 16:10.362
- Been there.
- You're a life-saver.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.526
Oh, I love your kicks.
Do you live nearby?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.762
Uh, yeah. Black Oak Drive.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.003
- Oh, Hilldale Crescent. I'm Angie.
- Alison.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.246
Hey Laura, it's me. Is he in?

16:23.320 --> 16:26.369
- Did you say Hillsdale Drive?
- Yeah.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.245
- Oh, I've never seen you before.
- We just moved in.

16:30.360 --> 16:33.284
Hey, hon, it's me. Brain cramp
over at the community centre.

16:33.360 --> 16:37.126
Um, I locked myself out of the car.
Can you bring me the spare key?

16:37.480 --> 16:38.970
You're the best.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.521
Half an hour.

16:41.920 --> 16:44.890
Hey, can I buy you a cup of coffee
as a thank-you?

16:44.960 --> 16:47.008
No, I have to pick up my kids.

16:47.080 --> 16:49.686
Okay, no worries.
Um, maybe some other time.

17:06.599 --> 17:09.523
I know I should have told you but, um,

17:10.599 --> 17:12.284
I wanted you all to myself.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.722
But you always left.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.568
You know, I never had a real mum and dad.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.530
- Yea h?
- Yeah.

17:24.400 --> 17:27.050
When I was your age, it made me very angry.

17:28.359 --> 17:31.842
And I was, um, so confused.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.163
And I don't want that for you.

17:38.360 --> 17:43.207
I guess I brought you here because
there's two parts of you. Yeah?

17:43.280 --> 17:44.850
One of them is me

17:46.080 --> 17:47.491
and one is your dad.

17:48.160 --> 17:49.764
Do you get that?

17:51.400 --> 17:53.243
Do you like Cal?

17:55.120 --> 17:59.250
Yeah. A long time ago,
I liked him very much.

18:01.760 --> 18:04.161
I like his beard.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.650
Make yourself at home.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.721
Sorry.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.009
I'm not snooping.

18:20.080 --> 18:21.889
Just wandering.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.521
Uh-huh.

18:23.720 --> 18:27.566
Listen, I am intimately acquainted
with my sister's bullshit.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.080
(CHUCKLES)

18:30.160 --> 18:31.924
My concern is for Kira.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.004
Whatever you're angling for, man, just ask.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.726
Good. Okay, who are you?

18:39.440 --> 18:41.727
Sarah must have come back here
for a reason, so what is this?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.040
What exactly do you do?

18:44.240 --> 18:45.480
It's what I did.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.164
- Pollinators.
- Sorry?

18:47.720 --> 18:52.169
Mini-drone pollinators for areas
where bee populations have crashed.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.725
I designed the micro-optics.

18:55.320 --> 18:59.006
But my partners forced me out and
sold the technology to the military.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.571
Now they kill people from bases in Virginia with it.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.361
But I don't.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.884
Moralist with money. Perfect mark.

19:12.960 --> 19:14.200
For child support?

19:15.360 --> 19:16.805
She already robbed me once.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.964

19:27.520 --> 19:29.648
<i>But the amazing news is</i>

19:29.720 --> 19:33.770
<i>Dr Aldous Leekie of the Dyad Institute</i>

19:34.600 --> 19:36.364
<i>says he can help.</i>

19:37.120 --> 19:38.884
<i>So, they're going to fly me out for the treatment,</i>

19:38.960 --> 19:40.610
<i>thanks to this amazing guy.</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:41.681
<i>Come.</i>

19:43.520 --> 19:45.761
<i>This is Greg, my amazing boyfriend.</i>

19:48.640 --> 19:51.325
- O <i>h, my god.
- Our new semester starts today.</i>

19:51.840 --> 19:55.731
<i>Halle sent me a picture of the new
class. They look like a good group.</i>

19:56.720 --> 19:59.485
That's enough. You've seen all of it.

20:01.280 --> 20:04.921
- That's her monitor, right?
- Yeah.

20:05.240 --> 20:06.969
Sometimes I forget that you're mine.

20:07.960 --> 20:09.166
That's good.

20:15.160 --> 20:19.529
He kept her completely in the dark.
She had this total fake hope.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.128
It's not fake. Not for any of us.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.890
The fact that she was naive
did not compromise her treatment.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.449
You know, we are telling you everything now

20:29.520 --> 20:31.807
but if you can't handle it...

20:31.880 --> 20:35.327
- I can handle it. Don't be a bitch.
- That's what I thought.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.845
Better get ready.

20:44.640 --> 20:45.766
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

20:50.800 --> 20:52.564
<i>I'm going to die here.</i>

21:01.640 --> 21:03.608
You brought us here on purpose.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.489
You wanted Kira to meet her father.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.244
I didn't even know he'd be here, Fe.

21:07.320 --> 21:10.449
Bollocks! That is bollocks, Sarah,
and you know it.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.201
For eight years,

21:12.280 --> 21:15.045
eight years you pretended you didn't know who he was?

21:15.120 --> 21:16.849
You let me narrow it down

21:16.920 --> 21:20.891
to Ziggy the drummer or that guy
you met in Orange County at that bar.

21:20.960 --> 21:22.041
You knew the whole time.

21:22.120 --> 21:26.125
Look, after yesterday, stealing to feed Kira...

21:29.240 --> 21:32.562
We were in the area, I just...
I knew it was time to...

21:32.640 --> 21:35.325
You are a bloody wrecking ball.

21:35.400 --> 21:37.402
You are an exploding cigar.
Do you know that?

21:37.480 --> 21:41.007
Just let me patch things up with Cal.
He's a good guy, Fe.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.411
- I bet he is.
- He is!

21:42.480 --> 21:44.801
Resourceful, big firm biceps...

21:44.880 --> 21:49.363
Yeah, he's completely disconnected
from all this shit we're dealing with.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.647
I think Kira deserves something...

21:51.720 --> 21:54.769
Something nourishing. For once.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.043
Even just for a few days.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.486
Yeah.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.964
No, you're right.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.008
She just met her father, you can't yank her away.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.571
But Uncle Felix isn't going to be
babysitting while you negotiate custody.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.165
Come on, Fe.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.921
I've got other drama in my life, Sarah.

22:17.560 --> 22:20.370
Alison's musical opens tomorrow.
She needs me.

22:26.840 --> 22:29.969
There's no place for me here.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.762
There's nothing more to say, except goodbye to Kira.

22:49.680 --> 22:51.045
You ready?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.884
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

23:17.640 --> 23:20.086
I take it you did a rotation in pathology,

23:20.160 --> 23:22.083
- Dr Cormier?
- I did.

23:22.800 --> 23:23.801
Then...
(COUGHS)

23:26.440 --> 23:28.169
- Are you okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

23:31.520 --> 23:32.851
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.763
Okay, are you fine to help me with this?
Because I...

23:34.840 --> 23:37.605
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

23:37.680 --> 23:39.887
So, as you can see, the intestine has been tied off.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.804
- So I'm going to cut it free.
- Yeah.

23:42.880 --> 23:46.601
What are those sores, um,

23:46.680 --> 23:48.569
- on her lips?
- Oh, look.

23:49.160 --> 23:52.084
From the treatment.
The same reason she lost her hair.

23:52.160 --> 23:55.881
So it's not Wegener's granulomatosis?

23:56.440 --> 24:00.331
Or Churg-Strauss Syndrome?
It's got to be autoimmune, right?

24:00.400 --> 24:02.084
Yes, but unclassified.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.401
And immunosuppressives had limited effect.

24:06.120 --> 24:08.122
Look, on the uterine wall.

24:08.200 --> 24:10.851
The growths, they're more pronounced, more mature.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.526
So this could mean that they have originated in the uterus

24:13.600 --> 24:15.364
and spread from there.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.162
That could be the cause of her infertility?

24:18.960 --> 24:20.291
Possibly.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.207
(MOBILE RINGING)

24:22.840 --> 24:25.207
No. Right now is not a good time.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.568
Sorry, it's my mom, I have to...

24:29.800 --> 24:31.564
Sorry. I'm kind of in middle of it.

24:31.640 --> 24:34.041
Red alert, Cosima, I've just been approached

24:34.120 --> 24:36.441
by another monitor, which means
they know I know about Donnie

24:36.520 --> 24:38.887
which means you definitely can't trust Delphine.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.446
That's complicated.

24:43.520 --> 24:45.488
Complicated? My play opens tomorrow.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.966
- <i>Your play.</i>
- <i>Don't belittle me, Cosima.</i>

24:50.240 --> 24:52.049
Felix is gone, Sarah is gone.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.926
You and I are the only ones
who can hold down the fort now.

24:55.000 --> 24:57.844
Look, I'm having enough trouble
holding down my own fort today.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.285
Sorry to bother you

24:59.360 --> 25:01.886
with the very crucial information
that I'm being double-monitored.

25:01.960 --> 25:04.645
I'm sorry. Okay? Uh...

25:04.720 --> 25:07.883
just go through the motions with Donnie, okay?

25:09.720 --> 25:11.165
Break a leg, or whatever.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.129
<i>I'll call you tomorrow. Okay?</i>

25:13.200 --> 25:15.646
Unless Delphine blackbags you into the back of a SUV

25:15.720 --> 25:19.327
and puts you in a rabbit cage somewhere.
Then I'll never speak to you again.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.568
- Hey, you.
- Hey!

25:51.640 --> 25:53.324
Hatha yoga today.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.561
It's mostly an older crowd

25:54.640 --> 25:57.166
but at least I don't get hipster dudes
staring at my ass, right?

25:58.640 --> 26:01.041
So, you must be in that play that starts today?

26:01.120 --> 26:05.045
Look, I know what you're doing, Angie,
if that's even your real name.

26:05.120 --> 26:08.886
So, you can just go back to your bosses
and tell them it didn't work.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.247
Okay, wait. Wait. You're right.

26:13.040 --> 26:14.280
<i>Okay-</i>

26:15.160 --> 26:17.925
I'm a police officer. Yeah, like Beth.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.966
So, why don't you tell me about that, huh?

26:22.840 --> 26:24.251
How about Sarah Manning?

26:25.320 --> 26:26.970
Look, I can help you.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.089
But you've got to tell me what you know.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.326
You stay away from me.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.170
Well, she's out like a light.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.288
She wanted me to say goodnight.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.044
You know, back then when you left,

27:02.600 --> 27:05.968
it took me a long time to admit
to myself that I'd been played.

27:07.120 --> 27:09.043
Yeah, well...

27:10.160 --> 27:14.609
What you don't know is that I already
had all your bank codes and passwords.

27:14.680 --> 27:17.570
I was going to take you for everything
you had selling your company.

27:17.640 --> 27:18.801
Why didn't you?

27:19.400 --> 27:21.164
You just made it...

27:22.360 --> 27:23.361
hard.

27:23.560 --> 27:28.407
I'm not that person any more, Cal,
but I'm still just as much trouble.

27:29.240 --> 27:30.526
- Get down.
- What?

27:31.280 --> 27:32.725
Hide.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.882
Local cop. You want to say hi?

27:40.200 --> 27:42.726
Hey, Tom! Great to see you, man.

27:42.800 --> 27:44.962
- Cal.
- How's that spey rod working out?

27:45.040 --> 27:48.522
Oh, I don't know how you cast that thing, 16 feet long.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.921
I spend half the day tangled in the bushes.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.834
You know you're supposed to use it on the water, right?

27:52.840 --> 27:54.808
Right.
(LAUGHING)

27:54.880 --> 27:56.962
So, uh, what's going on?

27:57.040 --> 27:58.963
Oh, bunch of nothing probably.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.567
Some shoplifters hit up the store.
Mom with a little girl

28:02.840 --> 28:04.285
- and another guy.
- Yeah?

28:04.360 --> 28:06.806
I found a stolen truck just down the way.

28:06.880 --> 28:08.211
May be connected, not sure.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.284
Huh. Well, it's been all quiet here
since I got back last night.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.563
Yeah, well...

28:15.720 --> 28:18.883
You know, I've never asked any questions
about why you moved here.

28:19.520 --> 28:22.126
Or about the little weed patch you got out back.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.486
Come on, man.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.404
Look, all I'm saying is I'd like
to think you can trust me by now.

28:27.960 --> 28:29.200
Tom.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.080
If I thought there was anything
you should know, I'd tell you.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.445
Good enough.

28:39.520 --> 28:41.284
- Night.
- See you later.

28:53.720 --> 28:54.721
(ENGINE STARTS)

28:57.160 --> 28:58.730
Huh.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.170
I shouldn't have put you in that position.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.288
- Listen, come on, it's all right.
- No.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.227
