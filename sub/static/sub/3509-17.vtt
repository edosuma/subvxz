00:02.337 --> 00:03.780
Previously on Castle...

00:08.896 --> 00:10.066
B. How can you not know

00:10.067 --> 00:12.254
the man you're sharing a
bed with is a terrorist?

00:12.255 --> 00:15.478
I swear to you. I don't know.
Jamal and Amir are not terrorists.

00:15.479 --> 00:16.694
You're chasing the wrong guy.

00:16.695 --> 00:18.110
Let's just talk about something else.

00:18.111 --> 00:20.957
How's Josh?
He's gone. He's always gone.

00:20.958 --> 00:23.886
Fariq Yusef. Syrian Consulate.
At your service.

00:23.887 --> 00:26.392
As events unfold, you may
find yourself in need

00:26.393 --> 00:30.086
of a man with my skills.
What if Amir suspected another driver?

00:30.087 --> 00:32.261
So the last two places
Amir was, and Kevin McCann

00:32.262 --> 00:34.562
has been to both of them?
We got a location on the truck.

00:34.563 --> 00:36.401
We at least have to go see
why this warehouse area

00:36.402 --> 00:38.404
is so popular. 
Open her up!

00:38.604 --> 00:48.804
Castle [3x17]
Countdown (Part 2)

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.854 --> 00:59.617
The bomb was not in the truck.

00:59.921 --> 01:02.776
No, sir. That's negative.

01:02.927 --> 01:04.693
The bomb was not in the truck.

01:04.694 --> 01:06.851
We have rad crews on the ground now.

01:07.040 --> 01:08.993
Yes, sir. I'll keep you apprised.

01:09.549 --> 01:11.640
Keep the perimeter at a 3-block radius.

01:11.641 --> 01:13.083
And keep the press the hell outta here.

01:13.084 --> 01:14.637
We don't need a panic on
our hands, all right?

01:15.142 --> 01:17.588
Sir, radiation teams have finished sweeping

01:17.589 --> 01:19.813
the immediate area...
negative across the board.

01:20.137 --> 01:23.550
If they moved the device, it's not nearby.
It makes no sense.

01:23.788 --> 01:25.680
Why would they move it?
It's a rodeo clown.

01:25.850 --> 01:28.903
Rodeo clown? 
The truck... It's a diversion.

01:29.113 --> 01:30.922
Jamal must have sensed we were closing in.

01:31.059 --> 01:33.208
He gave us something to chase,
throw us off the target.

01:33.209 --> 01:35.465
He's playing us.
So we're back to square one?

01:35.466 --> 01:38.274
We gotta find Jamal.
Move in on his employees.

01:38.275 --> 01:39.414
Shake the trees.

01:40.358 --> 01:42.202
Somebody's gotta know something.

01:45.518 --> 01:47.642
You think Fallon knows
he's chasing a dead man?

01:48.132 --> 01:51.390
No. And he won't know
unless we get out of here.

01:51.391 --> 01:52.563
Think they're coming back?

01:53.746 --> 01:54.972
Why would they?

01:55.302 --> 01:58.190
For Jamal. Why else would
they keep his body on ice?

01:58.588 --> 01:59.818
Whoever's behind this

02:00.255 --> 02:03.480
wanted to preserve his
body for some reason.

02:04.011 --> 02:04.992
I'm thinking...

02:05.481 --> 02:08.339
They wanted his body in
that van with the bomb.

02:08.340 --> 02:09.731
That way, when the bomb goes off...

02:09.810 --> 02:12.117
They'd have his remains and his D.N.A.
at the crime scene.

02:12.118 --> 02:13.835
People would think that he was the terrorist.
Right.

02:13.836 --> 02:16.186
And then the real terrorists
would get away scot-free.

02:16.187 --> 02:19.113
Okay, so then the question is, why?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.418
What is their agenda?

02:21.512 --> 02:23.079
We're not gonna find out in here.

02:23.249 --> 02:25.930
Well, Castle, thank you
for stating the obvious.

02:27.613 --> 02:29.035
You got anything? 
No, no.

02:29.036 --> 02:31.949
No thermostat, no control box.
Must be on the outside.

02:31.950 --> 02:33.322
Got any bars on your phone?

02:33.526 --> 02:34.538
Uh...

02:38.011 --> 02:38.757
No.

02:38.758 --> 02:39.925
Wait, wait, wait.

02:40.926 --> 02:42.230
No. You?

02:43.382 --> 02:44.468
No.

02:49.114 --> 02:50.894
How cold do you think it is in here?

02:50.895 --> 02:52.789
Um, judging by the way that it feels,

02:53.414 --> 02:55.589
I'd say it's well below freezing.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.047
How long do you think we're gonna last

02:59.048 --> 03:00.355
dressed like this?

03:01.103 --> 03:02.918
A couple of hours at the most.

03:03.129 --> 03:04.372
That's what I thought, too.

03:09.079 --> 03:10.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:10.225 --> 03:11.846
That door is made of steel. I don't...

03:11.847 --> 03:13.317
I don't think that's gonna do anything.

03:13.318 --> 03:15.399
Castle, nobody knows that we're in here.

03:15.838 --> 03:17.835
Nobody even knows to look for us.

03:17.836 --> 03:19.870
We're gonna freeze to death
if we don't get outta here.

03:19.871 --> 03:21.446
Well, maybe there's another way out.

03:25.147 --> 03:27.602
Right. Uh... on three?

03:27.780 --> 03:29.171
Yeah. One. Two.

03:29.172 --> 03:32.314
Three. Okay, again. One. Two.

03:32.315 --> 03:33.913
Two. Three.

03:34.146 --> 03:35.047
Again. One.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.865
Two. Three.

03:36.866 --> 03:38.116
We didn't have to come back.

03:38.117 --> 03:40.292
I was fine, you know. 
Fine?

03:40.293 --> 03:42.940
I could literally feel
your anxiety level rising

03:42.941 --> 03:44.558
the further we got from the city.

03:44.559 --> 03:45.906
A spiritual retreat

03:45.907 --> 03:48.217
is supposed to be spiritual, darling,

03:48.218 --> 03:49.617
not stressful.

03:50.033 --> 03:53.353
We'll do it another time
when you don't have a test

03:53.354 --> 03:54.922
hanging over you.

03:55.340 --> 03:57.850
Although I could've written
you a brilliant excuse.

03:57.851 --> 04:00.019
I used to write the best
ones for your father...

04:00.183 --> 04:03.917
Circus accidents, apartment... fires.

04:04.422 --> 04:05.869
Movie night?

04:06.503 --> 04:07.684
I don't know.

04:07.685 --> 04:09.800
He has the projector up, but...

04:12.517 --> 04:13.584
Huh.

04:13.970 --> 04:15.234
He's not here.

04:15.398 --> 04:17.677
Well, maybe he's out, as in...

04:17.678 --> 04:20.976
Yes. Ew. But he always calls when he's out

04:20.978 --> 04:22.255
or leaves a note.

04:22.256 --> 04:24.926
Well, he figured we were gone,

04:24.927 --> 04:26.453
so why bother?

04:26.719 --> 04:28.578
It's late, darling. Come on.

04:28.774 --> 04:30.136
We'll ask him in the morning.

04:30.137 --> 04:30.849
Oh.

04:39.173 --> 04:40.285
Castle, that's not good.

04:40.286 --> 04:41.854
No, it's not.

04:42.086 --> 04:43.048
All right.

04:43.049 --> 04:44.653
Stand back. Mm.

04:44.970 --> 04:47.486
What are you gonna do?
 Just stand back.

04:48.306 --> 04:49.286
Oh, whoa.

04:50.487 --> 04:52.354
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

04:53.218 --> 04:55.997
Are you trying to kill us sooner?
Do you have a better idea?

04:55.998 --> 04:58.225
Maybe just save a few rounds
in case they come back.

05:03.559 --> 05:04.715
Castle...

05:05.587 --> 05:06.718
I could use a silver lining

05:06.719 --> 05:08.371
right about now, okay?

05:08.372 --> 05:09.470
Yeah. Um...

05:14.894 --> 05:16.460
I wish I had one.

05:21.090 --> 05:22.559
This doesn't make any sense.

05:23.371 --> 05:24.295
What, bro?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.379
These guys that work for
Jamal's moving company,

05:26.380 --> 05:28.914
they are Middle Eastern, but
most of 'em are citizens

05:28.915 --> 05:30.404
born here in the States.

05:30.684 --> 05:32.419
Aside from a couple of traffic violations,

05:32.420 --> 05:35.981
their records are clean.
Maybe that's why they were recruited.

05:36.924 --> 05:38.395
Now you're starting to sound like Fallon.

05:39.107 --> 05:40.442
You know, maybe Castle was right.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.433
Maybe there is something
else going on here.

05:48.653 --> 05:49.787
Ryan.

05:59.635 --> 06:00.872
You get anything?

06:01.651 --> 06:02.541
Nothing so far.

06:02.542 --> 06:04.776
They claim to not know anything
about Jamal's whereabouts

06:04.777 --> 06:06.117
or his activities.

06:06.118 --> 06:07.143
And the ones that are lawyering up

06:07.144 --> 06:08.698
are accusing us of racial profiling.

06:10.076 --> 06:11.478
They're not wrong.

06:13.129 --> 06:14.201
You okay?

06:17.089 --> 06:18.612
Compared to a nuke,

06:18.829 --> 06:20.814
a dirty bomb is a fairly crude device.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.130
It's designed to instill
fear in the populace.

06:23.493 --> 06:25.012
The majority of the immediate damage

06:25.013 --> 06:26.854
is gonna come from the
conventional explosion,

06:26.855 --> 06:29.122
creating a kill zone. 
Like Oklahoma City.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.239
Except for it's not just
a building that falls.

06:31.240 --> 06:32.995
It spreads radiation for several blocks.

06:32.996 --> 06:34.642
That's your secondary kill zone.

06:35.002 --> 06:37.608
If left untreated, people can
die from radiation poisoning

06:37.609 --> 06:38.811
in less than a week.

06:39.434 --> 06:42.040
But what makes this such
an effective terror weapon

06:42.041 --> 06:43.565
is the outer zone.

06:44.973 --> 06:47.756
Now in this area, everybody
seems fine at first.

06:49.182 --> 06:51.209
Then the cancers start showing up...

06:51.471 --> 06:53.140
babies, kids, adults.

06:54.096 --> 06:55.923
And with every new case that's reported,

06:55.924 --> 06:58.091
people flock to the emergency
rooms, overwhelm the system.

06:58.092 --> 07:00.331
It's like we're being
attacked all over again.

07:04.411 --> 07:06.002
Look, if we can't find the bomb,

07:06.429 --> 07:08.047
maybe we can find the target.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.481
Pull everybody you got.

07:09.482 --> 07:10.997
Give me a list of every significant event

07:10.998 --> 07:12.696
going on in the city for
the next 48 hours...

07:12.697 --> 07:14.584
Anyplace were people might
gather in large numbers.

07:14.585 --> 07:16.212
This is New York City.
There are a hundred events

07:16.213 --> 07:18.643
going on every day we
have to narrow it down.

07:18.644 --> 07:21.080
Focus on anything political
or government related.

07:21.273 --> 07:22.722
Are there any sporting events going on?

07:22.723 --> 07:24.287
What's happening at the U.N.?

07:26.187 --> 07:28.838
Maybe there's a reason they're
choosing to strike now.

07:29.565 --> 07:31.398
Sir, can I speak with you alone?

07:32.032 --> 07:33.241
Excuse us.

07:35.405 --> 07:38.827
So what's wrong? 
I just got off the phone with Castle's daughter.

07:38.828 --> 07:40.236
Apparently, he hasn't come home,

07:40.237 --> 07:41.758
and she hasn't been able
to reach him on his cell.

07:41.759 --> 07:45.003
So? Castle got kicked off the task force.
Why isn't he at home?

07:45.004 --> 07:46.078
How should I know? 
Well,

07:46.079 --> 07:47.591
Beckett's not answering her phone either.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.532
We thought, given their history, that...

07:49.533 --> 07:51.347
We thought the two of them might
have got on to something.

07:51.348 --> 07:54.623
You two do realize that a
terrorist cell is threatening

07:54.624 --> 07:56.142
to strike and thousands
of lives may be at risk?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.347
Yes, sir. But... 
What do you want me to do,

07:57.348 --> 07:58.177
send out a search party

07:58.178 --> 07:59.753
because your pals aren't
answering their cell phones

07:59.754 --> 08:00.936
in the middle of the night?
For all I know, they could be

08:00.937 --> 08:02.002
out having a cold one. 
Captain...

08:02.003 --> 08:04.916
I appreciate your concern,
and I'm sure they appreciate

08:04.917 --> 08:07.177
your concern, but they can
take care of themselves.

08:07.178 --> 08:10.846
Besides, we have a terrorist to find.
Yes, sir.

08:11.062 --> 08:12.283
Yes, sir.

08:18.281 --> 08:19.694
Mm. Castle.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.418
Are you there?

08:23.419 --> 08:24.645
Yeah, yeah. No, I'm... I'm right...

08:24.646 --> 08:26.206
I'm right here.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.040
I can't feel anything.

08:35.308 --> 08:36.207
Oh.

08:38.874 --> 08:40.384
I always thought...

08:41.768 --> 08:44.215
Being a cop, I'd take a bullet.

08:50.012 --> 08:52.341
I never thought I'd freeze to death.

08:52.531 --> 08:53.677
Hey.

08:55.495 --> 08:57.753
W-w-we're not dead yet.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.525
I just wish this was one of your books.

09:06.526 --> 09:08.531
Then you could rewrite the ending.

09:09.281 --> 09:10.306
Mm.

09:14.550 --> 09:16.926
I'm s... I'm sorry.

09:17.515 --> 09:18.843
For what?

09:20.976 --> 09:22.953
Fo-for being me...

09:23.109 --> 09:24.525
Mm.

09:25.053 --> 09:27.562
For going rogue, getting you into...

09:27.781 --> 09:28.982
Into this.

09:29.587 --> 09:31.582
If we hadn't gone on our own...

09:31.583 --> 09:33.860
Oh, shh. Shh. Castle, no.

09:34.081 --> 09:36.199
Okay? 
Shh. Shh.

09:37.964 --> 09:39.561
You were right.

09:40.282 --> 09:42.254
We found the bomb.

09:44.642 --> 09:47.199
We were just too late. 
Okay?

10:01.986 --> 10:03.279
Castle.

10:03.462 --> 10:04.644
Yeah.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.263
Thank you

10:09.997 --> 10:11.747
for being there.

10:14.567 --> 10:15.809
Always.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.632
I just want you to know how much I...

10:28.453 --> 10:29.840
Hey, Kate.

10:32.350 --> 10:34.014
Stay with me.

10:35.651 --> 10:37.349
Kate?

10:38.082 --> 10:39.501
Shh. Shh.

10:41.302 --> 10:42.945
Stay with me.

11:34.434 --> 11:35.597
Easy, pal.

11:35.694 --> 11:37.136
Beckett. Where is she?

11:37.137 --> 11:39.278
Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down.
Where is she?

11:39.279 --> 11:41.848
She's gonna be fine. You're both fine.

11:42.022 --> 11:44.669
Got to you just in time.
 Josh?

11:44.957 --> 11:48.366
Hey. So you're recovering from a
moderate case of hypothermia.

11:48.786 --> 11:50.725
And you're gonna be a little
bit sluggish for a while,

11:50.726 --> 11:52.745
but with some warmth and some fluids,

11:52.746 --> 11:56.458
you should be all right. What...
I thought you were in Haiti.

11:56.642 --> 11:59.647
Mm-hmm. Didn't go. This is gonna hurt.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.084
Okay.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.850
Let's see if we can't get you to sit up.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.249
All right? Move slow.

12:08.688 --> 12:09.775
There you go.

12:11.441 --> 12:12.890
How long was I out?

12:12.891 --> 12:15.252
Uh, I don't know. About an hour? 
The bomb.

12:15.253 --> 12:17.677
We searched the entire warehouse.
It's gone.

12:18.926 --> 12:20.043
How'd you find us?

12:20.044 --> 12:22.034
Oh, Alexis called.
Said you didn't come home.

12:22.035 --> 12:25.004
Alexis? She's supposed to be out of town.
I guess she came back.

12:25.005 --> 12:27.956
We figured you were with
Beckett until Josh called.

12:27.957 --> 12:29.657
We thought you must be out there

12:29.658 --> 12:32.231
doing something incredibly
stupid against orders,

12:32.232 --> 12:33.393
so we sent patrol units

12:33.394 --> 12:35.683
everywhere we figured you'd
be moronic enough to go.

12:35.684 --> 12:37.519
Found Beckett's car, searched the area

12:37.520 --> 12:39.814
till we found the light
from the storage container.

12:39.815 --> 12:41.893
Well, I'm glad my stupidity is predictable.

12:42.578 --> 12:44.091
You pulled us outta there?

12:46.494 --> 12:47.689
Thanks.

12:56.889 --> 12:58.622
So your boy's back in town.

12:58.968 --> 13:00.135
Mm-hmm.

13:01.166 --> 13:02.558
He came back.

13:03.586 --> 13:05.080
So what does that mean to you?

13:07.096 --> 13:08.783
It means we have a chance.

13:12.242 --> 13:14.811
Come on. Fallon wants to debrief.

13:14.985 --> 13:16.300
Think he's ready to believe us?

13:16.301 --> 13:18.945
N.E.S.T. confirms high
levels of residual radiation

13:18.946 --> 13:20.787
along with a military-grade Semtex.

13:20.788 --> 13:22.560
There's no question that device was here.

13:22.561 --> 13:24.058
I'll have my team pull surveillance tape

13:24.059 --> 13:25.975
on every camera within a
quarter-mile of here.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.201
Sounds good. I'll catch up to you.

13:27.202 --> 13:28.371
Beckett. 
Sir.

13:29.506 --> 13:32.828
You two. Are you always this
stubborn and insubordinate?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.558
Only when we're trying to save the world.

13:34.929 --> 13:36.999
I'd be more impressed if you succeeded.

13:37.178 --> 13:38.463
How did you know to come here?

13:38.464 --> 13:41.576
Security cameras in Amir's cab.
We think that

13:41.577 --> 13:44.352
he was keeping tabs on one
of his drivers...Kevin McCann.

13:44.507 --> 13:45.992
We pulled McCann's route records.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.726
Turns out he visited that storage facility

13:47.727 --> 13:49.615
in Washington Heights where
the radioactive material

13:49.616 --> 13:51.041
was being kept and this warehouse

13:51.042 --> 13:53.465
long before Amir did.
McCann was here before him?

13:53.466 --> 13:55.623
Yeah, it looks like Amir was
following McCann, trying to

13:55.624 --> 13:57.650
figure out what he was up to
until he was caught and killed.

13:57.651 --> 14:00.466
And with Amir, their intended
patsy dead, we think they were

14:00.467 --> 14:02.798
trying to implicate his
cousin Jamal as the bomber.

14:02.799 --> 14:04.648
That's why they were
keeping his body on ice.

14:04.649 --> 14:06.900
Did you see any other members of the cell here?
No, it was dark.

14:06.901 --> 14:08.903
And they were shooting. 
But we do

14:08.904 --> 14:11.113
know that the bomb is housed
in a white commercial van

14:11.114 --> 14:12.962
with a rear and side passenger door.

14:12.963 --> 14:14.852
A white van in New York City?

14:15.423 --> 14:16.995
Well, that narrows it down.

14:17.213 --> 14:20.413
We saw the counter.
It's set to go off at 4:00 today.

14:20.695 --> 14:23.297
That's less than ten hours from now.
All right.

14:24.011 --> 14:26.793
I'll put up checkpoints.
But it's already in the city.

14:26.794 --> 14:29.258
Look, I know all the evidence
points to Amir and Jamal,

14:29.259 --> 14:31.094
but something bigger is going on here,

14:31.095 --> 14:33.368
and Kevin McCann is involved.

14:34.785 --> 14:36.596
Got it. 
Yo.

14:36.879 --> 14:38.179
That was a taxi company.

14:38.422 --> 14:39.692
McCann's supposed to be on shift right now,

14:39.693 --> 14:40.847
but he didn't show up and he's

14:40.848 --> 14:42.634
not answering his phone.
Did you get an address?

14:42.635 --> 14:44.976
D.M.V. lists an apartment off
Jerome Avenue in the Bronx.

14:44.977 --> 14:46.276
All right. Get a team together.

14:46.277 --> 14:49.189
Go up there and get him. 
Agent Fallon?

14:49.190 --> 14:51.898
Yeah? 
Given the circumstances, we'd like to request

14:51.899 --> 14:54.274
to be reinstated on the task force.

14:54.275 --> 14:55.708
Well, that's not up to me.

14:57.056 --> 14:58.703
It'll be up to your doctor, isn't it?

15:07.687 --> 15:09.082
You know, it's funny.

15:09.265 --> 15:12.025
When I first met you two, I
thought you were together.

15:12.698 --> 15:16.006
Oh. No, just... just friends.

15:16.902 --> 15:18.130
Get cleaned up.

15:18.356 --> 15:19.805
We got a long day ahead of us.

15:32.235 --> 15:34.884
Oh, Richard, darling.
Oh, are you all right?

15:34.885 --> 15:37.877
Are you using that blanket? Oh, no.
I'm gonna give it to you.

15:37.878 --> 15:40.104
Oh, you poor baby.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.391
You look like death warmed over.

15:43.392 --> 15:45.008
If someone tries to sell you on cryogenics,

15:45.009 --> 15:46.816
say no.
I knew you wouldn't turn your phone off

15:46.817 --> 15:48.224
without leaving me a message.

15:48.225 --> 15:50.383
Now is this about the cab driver?

15:51.424 --> 15:53.902
Look, I need you girls
to do something for me.

15:54.353 --> 15:56.293
But I don't want you to ask any questions.

15:57.869 --> 15:58.952
I want you to go the Hamptons.

15:58.953 --> 16:00.904
I want you to stay there for the weekend.

16:01.171 --> 16:04.532
Richard, what is this about? 
See, that...that's a question.

16:06.051 --> 16:07.750
Look, there might be a...

16:10.318 --> 16:11.752
An event...

16:12.034 --> 16:14.845
That will make it very
dangerous to stay in the city.

16:15.787 --> 16:17.340
What are you doing? 
Calling Ashley.

16:17.341 --> 16:19.777
No, no, no, no. You can't tell anybody.

16:19.778 --> 16:22.055
Okay? You can't tell anybody.
You tell Ashley,

16:22.056 --> 16:24.238
he'll tell his parents, they'll
call someone they love, and...

16:25.951 --> 16:27.574
A panic will make this thing

16:27.575 --> 16:29.445
a thousand times harder to stop.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.908
Dad, he's my boyfriend. 
I know.

16:30.909 --> 16:33.500
This isn't fair. You can't...
Fair has nothing to do with it.

16:36.577 --> 16:38.980
I need you to go. Now.

16:38.981 --> 16:40.950
But you'll come too?

16:42.508 --> 16:44.042
I will when I can.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.848
But I need you to go.

16:49.577 --> 16:50.923
Now.

16:52.249 --> 16:53.344
Okay.

17:05.439 --> 17:07.288
Figured you could use the caffeine

17:08.400 --> 17:09.852
and the warmth.

17:10.431 --> 17:11.545
Thank you.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.162
Are you okay?

17:20.163 --> 17:21.938
Yeah. No. I'm...

17:26.084 --> 17:27.883
You ever wonder about Fallon?

17:27.884 --> 17:30.777
I mean, what this must be like for him,

17:30.778 --> 17:32.390
living this every day?

17:32.759 --> 17:35.004
I told Alexis and my
mother to get out of town.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.763
I didn't tell them why, but they knew.

17:39.134 --> 17:40.277
They wanted to tell their friends,

17:40.278 --> 17:43.475
and I told them they couldn't.

17:44.406 --> 17:46.181
I felt like a monster.

17:46.952 --> 17:49.623
I mean, that must be some kind of hell...

17:50.943 --> 17:53.859
Feeling that all the time.

17:56.935 --> 17:57.837
Kinda makes you wonder

17:57.838 --> 18:00.053
how many times this has happened since 9/11

18:00.054 --> 18:01.821
and we were the ones who didn't know.

18:05.855 --> 18:06.660
Beckett.

18:06.661 --> 18:07.614
Yeah, the McCann address

18:07.615 --> 18:09.990
is a dead end. Korean family lives here.

18:10.187 --> 18:11.949
Been living here for the past four years.

18:11.950 --> 18:13.137
Did you search the place?

18:13.138 --> 18:15.413
Yeah, didn't seem to be
anything out of the ordinary.

18:15.414 --> 18:17.937
But we did talk to a longtime
neighbor, and they said

18:17.938 --> 18:19.952
the McCann family lived here,
but it was over a decade ago.

18:19.953 --> 18:21.582
She seems to recall something about them

18:21.583 --> 18:24.624
having a son named Kevin, and
he went in the military.

18:24.822 --> 18:25.951
Kevin McCann...

18:26.293 --> 18:28.601
Army special forces, recipient
of two purple hearts

18:28.602 --> 18:29.805
and the distinguished service medal

18:29.806 --> 18:33.168
during his six tours in Afghanistan.
Six tours?

18:33.356 --> 18:35.519
Military is stretched
pretty thin these days.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.818
Doesn't make any sense.

18:37.128 --> 18:39.737
What's a war hero doing mixed
up in a terrorist plot?

18:39.738 --> 18:41.452
Don't look at me, pal. It's your theory.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.762
Do they have an address listed?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.484
Arlington, Virginia.

18:49.418 --> 18:50.281
Kevin McCann...

18:50.282 --> 18:52.361
the real Kevin McCann...
died a couple of years back

18:52.362 --> 18:54.576
at a V.A. hospital from
complications of wounds

18:54.577 --> 18:56.391
he suffered during combat ops.

18:56.392 --> 18:58.454
Buried at Arlington with full honors.

18:58.455 --> 19:00.132
So someone stole his identity.

19:00.538 --> 19:02.188
He could be anyone,

19:02.635 --> 19:04.470
including a foreign agent.

19:11.633 --> 19:13.023
Run this through FBI and CIA

19:13.024 --> 19:15.058
facial recognition databases
all the way up to Interpol.

19:15.059 --> 19:16.621
I want to know everything
I can about this guy.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.039
All right, so tech tracked the phone

19:18.040 --> 19:19.841
that he's been using under the McCann name.

19:19.842 --> 19:22.373
Patrol units just found it in a dumpster.
Been wiped clean.

19:22.374 --> 19:24.760
We've got an A.P.B. out on him
and we sent copies

19:24.761 --> 19:26.786
of his photo to everyone.
 Yo.

19:26.787 --> 19:28.646
Teams are on their way to the taxi depot

19:28.647 --> 19:30.959
and the impound to pull prints
from the cabs he drove, but with

19:30.960 --> 19:33.173
multiple drivers and
passengers, there are gonna be

19:33.174 --> 19:34.744
hundreds of prints in each cab.

19:34.745 --> 19:36.893
It's gonna take some time.
It's time we don't have.

19:36.894 --> 19:39.189
Why would he steal McCann's identity?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.653
I thought this guy was a crime novelist?

19:42.505 --> 19:43.988
I-I am. 
Well, then you

19:43.989 --> 19:45.550
should know that sometimes
people who operate

19:45.551 --> 19:47.876
outside the law will take
the social security number

19:47.877 --> 19:50.319
of a deceased individual and use
it to forge a new identity.

19:50.320 --> 19:52.527
I know. I've done it
three times in my books.

19:52.528 --> 19:53.613
What I'm saying is,

19:53.614 --> 19:56.831
why would he steal Kevin McCann's identity?

19:57.345 --> 19:58.609
Because it was convenient.

19:58.610 --> 20:00.323
Why was it convenient?

20:00.525 --> 20:03.531
I mean, the money that was
deposited into Amir's account

20:03.532 --> 20:04.264
to implicate him,

20:04.265 --> 20:05.763
we tracked it back to Afghanistan.

20:05.764 --> 20:07.388
McCann served in Afghanistan.

20:07.389 --> 20:10.090
Maybe there's a link. 
What kind of link?

20:10.091 --> 20:13.584
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe this guy wasn't just

20:13.585 --> 20:15.755
stealing the identity of
some random dead guy.

20:15.756 --> 20:17.998
Maybe... McCann is someone he knew

20:17.999 --> 20:19.661
or someone he needed to be.

20:21.650 --> 20:22.621
Contact the Pentagon.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.219
Get everything you can on McCann. 
Got it.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.141
His family used to live here.

20:25.142 --> 20:26.514
Are they still around? 
Parents are dead,

20:26.515 --> 20:28.067
but he's got a sister in Queens.

20:32.571 --> 20:34.005
Sorry about the mess.

20:34.006 --> 20:36.418
It's just...
it's been hard since Doug left.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.970
Sweetie, just go play in your room.

20:39.817 --> 20:41.414
So what happened?

20:41.415 --> 20:43.502
My deadbeat ex got arrested again?

20:43.713 --> 20:45.779
Actually, Ms. McCann,
we're here about your brother.

20:48.905 --> 20:50.333
Yeah, I know him.

20:51.114 --> 20:52.436
That's Radford.

20:52.698 --> 20:53.979
Radford Hayes.

20:54.600 --> 20:57.247
He was in my brother's unit.
They were best friends.

20:57.518 --> 20:59.216
He assumed your brother's identity.

21:00.458 --> 21:02.071
Do you have any idea why?

21:02.812 --> 21:03.916
No.

21:04.188 --> 21:05.758
How well did you know him?

21:06.441 --> 21:09.472
Mostly from my brother's letters.

21:09.473 --> 21:11.091
They were in the V.A. together.

21:11.681 --> 21:13.868
He was there with me when...

21:14.338 --> 21:15.728
When Kevin died.

21:15.814 --> 21:17.987
In his letters, did he
ever display any animosity

21:17.988 --> 21:19.252
toward this country?

21:19.987 --> 21:21.755
Why is he asking me that?

21:22.277 --> 21:24.702
There's a possibility that Mr. Hayes
is working

21:24.703 --> 21:27.665
with a set of extremists who
are plotting against the U.S.

21:29.165 --> 21:30.435
No.

21:30.951 --> 21:32.351
Colleen?

21:35.484 --> 21:38.395
Radford took me out for a
beer after Kevin died,

21:38.711 --> 21:40.136
and he was angry...

21:40.788 --> 21:44.523
Angry at how everyone stopped
caring about the war.

21:44.524 --> 21:46.249
Like it wasn't even happening,

21:46.446 --> 21:49.317
angry at the way politicians
were treating them,

21:49.525 --> 21:51.232
like they were tissue paper,

21:51.233 --> 21:53.305
to be used and thrown away.

21:55.086 --> 21:56.677
He thought the folks in Washington

21:56.678 --> 21:58.721
cared more about scoring political points

21:58.722 --> 21:59.900
than winning.

22:01.478 --> 22:03.803
He said that maybe what this country needed

22:03.804 --> 22:05.907
was another wake-up call.

22:08.426 --> 22:10.851
Maybe next time, we'd get it right.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.441
Do you know where we can find him?

22:17.237 --> 22:18.496
No.

22:20.046 --> 22:22.332
All I have is his cell phone number.

22:27.997 --> 22:30.049
His phone's active, but it's old-school.

22:30.050 --> 22:32.589
No native GPS.
How long before you get a fix on him?

22:32.590 --> 22:34.729
I'll need a few minutes to
triangulate off the cell towers.

22:34.730 --> 22:36.948
Do what you gotta do.
Just don't let him know we're coming.

22:37.505 --> 22:39.453
I can't believe we're
chasing one of our own.

22:39.940 --> 22:43.355
He's not wrong, you know?
Used to be, we'd go to war,

22:43.356 --> 22:45.506
everybody sacrifices, everybody pitches in.

22:45.507 --> 22:47.134
Now you don't even see it on the news.

22:47.424 --> 22:51.401
I'm not defending him.
I'm just saying, I understand the anger.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.763
Well, Amir is the perfect patsy.

22:52.764 --> 22:56.244
He has a background in weapons
engineering, ties to Syria,

22:56.245 --> 22:58.376
which is a hotbed for Al Qaeda recruiting.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.353
I mean, it has terrorist
written all over it.

23:00.354 --> 23:02.349
And the money from his Afghanistan account

23:02.350 --> 23:03.280
would've had people believing

23:03.281 --> 23:06.571
Taliban was involved.
We're so programmed by fear.

23:06.898 --> 23:08.804
People are gonna believe
exactly what Radford

23:08.805 --> 23:11.005
wants us to believe...
That we were attacked again...

23:11.006 --> 23:12.506
and then they're gonna cry out for blood.

23:12.678 --> 23:13.941
In less than four hours.

23:13.942 --> 23:17.470
If we can't stop it, shouldn't we tell people?
Tell 'em what,

23:17.471 --> 23:19.855
that a dirty bomb is gonna go
off somewhere in Manhattan?

23:19.856 --> 23:21.440
You know the kind of
panic that would create?

23:21.757 --> 23:24.569
No. Our only hope is to stop this thing.

23:24.570 --> 23:27.988
Let's just hope that we can.
We got him. Let's roll.

23:44.121 --> 23:45.564
Hayes!

23:49.435 --> 23:51.190
Get down! Get down!

23:51.191 --> 23:53.290
Get down! Get down! Now!

23:53.291 --> 23:54.556
On your knees! On your knees!

23:54.557 --> 23:56.653
Interlock your fingers behind your head!

23:59.614 --> 24:00.711
Yeah.

24:02.418 --> 24:03.933
Tell me where it is.

24:04.294 --> 24:06.968
Where's the bomb? Where is it?

24:08.509 --> 24:09.347
Where's the bomb?

24:16.345 --> 24:17.757
This guy makes me sick.

24:17.758 --> 24:19.509
He swore an oath to defend this country.

24:19.780 --> 24:23.027
In his mind, he's a patriot.
Yeah, like Tim McVeigh.

24:23.028 --> 24:24.593
Ryan, contact D.O.D.

24:24.594 --> 24:25.714
See if you can get 20s

24:25.715 --> 24:27.868
on the guys he served with in Afghanistan.

24:27.869 --> 24:29.404
See if any of 'em are blowin' in the wind.

24:33.525 --> 24:34.649
You ready?

24:34.896 --> 24:35.862
Yeah.

24:36.064 --> 24:38.621
We break him, no matter what.

24:39.399 --> 24:40.472
Got it.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.027
Look, I know you're angry,

24:46.028 --> 24:47.627
and I understand.

24:47.628 --> 24:50.271
But what you're doing, what
you're involved with...

24:51.783 --> 24:53.173
It's not the way.

24:54.302 --> 24:55.537
Radford, you're a soldier.

24:55.538 --> 24:58.260
The people in this city
are not your enemies.

25:00.055 --> 25:02.562
I have no idea what you're talking about.

25:02.770 --> 25:03.796
Look, we know about you

25:03.797 --> 25:06.884
going up to the storage
facilities in Washington Heights

25:07.007 --> 25:08.672
and the warehouse.

25:09.249 --> 25:10.874
What about it?

25:10.875 --> 25:11.830
Well, we know that there was

25:11.831 --> 25:14.088
nuclear material in the storage facility,

25:14.089 --> 25:17.743
the bomb was assembled in
the warehouse, so don't

25:17.744 --> 25:20.229
insult us and tell us you
don't know anything about it.

25:20.230 --> 25:23.133
He's wasting his time. 
Why do you say that?

25:23.584 --> 25:25.956
He's Special Forces.
We're trained for this...

25:25.957 --> 25:27.674
Never to give up information,

25:27.675 --> 25:29.915
never to give up your
position if you're captured.

25:30.282 --> 25:32.940
They can't break him. 
Not in time.

25:33.508 --> 25:35.441
Do you see yourself as a...

25:35.442 --> 25:36.875
a great hero

25:37.273 --> 25:40.021
doing this for a-a mighty cause?

25:40.420 --> 25:42.414
You think that's how
people are gonna see you?

25:42.415 --> 25:44.263
Because I'll tell you right now, brother,

25:45.551 --> 25:49.299
if you let this happen, you're
gonna go down in history

25:49.300 --> 25:52.034
as America's greatest mass murderer.

25:54.569 --> 25:56.280
Is that what you want?

25:56.832 --> 25:58.925
When this bomb goes off,

25:59.801 --> 26:02.396
do you think they're
gonna be looking at me?

26:02.712 --> 26:05.185
People will see this as an act of terrorism

26:05.186 --> 26:08.265
so they will be looking for a terrorist,

26:08.474 --> 26:11.018
not a patriot, not one of their own.

26:11.019 --> 26:12.819
Is that what you think you are, a patriot?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.859
There's a word for people like you,

26:14.860 --> 26:16.254
and it's not "patriot."

26:17.311 --> 26:19.076
It's "traitor."

26:21.243 --> 26:24.642
The powers that be have
no use for a traitor.

26:24.798 --> 26:26.075
So when they find their terrorist,

26:26.076 --> 26:28.979
and they will find their terrorist,

26:29.618 --> 26:31.328
what do you think will happen to me?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.219
Well, let me tell you, because I know them,

26:34.220 --> 26:35.996
I know how they think.

26:36.465 --> 26:38.678
I will become a footnote
in one of your files

26:38.679 --> 26:41.472
buried so far back, no
one will ever find it,

26:41.937 --> 26:44.639
because anything more
would be an inconvenience

26:44.640 --> 26:47.884
to their self-serving,
rabble-rousing narrative.

26:48.386 --> 26:50.313
So why don't you do us all a favor

26:51.227 --> 26:53.331
and just accept the inevitable?

26:59.157 --> 27:01.900
You think this is a joke?
You think I'm playing with you?!

27:02.145 --> 27:03.533
Where's the bomb?!

27:06.682 --> 27:08.632
Where's the bomb?! 
Fallon, no!

27:08.868 --> 27:10.922
Where is it? Where's the target, Radford?

27:10.923 --> 27:12.722
Lower your weapon, Fallon.
Where's the target?

27:12.723 --> 27:15.087
Fallon! Lower your weapon now!

27:15.088 --> 27:17.065
Not until he tells me what I want to hear.

27:17.506 --> 27:19.700
Where is it?! 
Lower your weapon!

27:19.701 --> 27:22.842
You ready to go all the way? Huh?

27:25.312 --> 27:28.050
I'm prepared to die for my country.

27:28.051 --> 27:29.298
Are you?

27:30.262 --> 27:32.976
Put down your weapon now.

27:49.728 --> 27:52.616
Hey. I got that.

27:53.482 --> 27:54.606
Thank you.

28:05.354 --> 28:07.111
He wasn't gonna break, you know?

28:07.112 --> 28:09.366
If I had a couple of days, maybe a week,

28:09.367 --> 28:10.728
but not in three hours.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.337
We needed him to break.
I saw an opening. I took it.

28:13.338 --> 28:15.796
You violated his rights.

28:15.797 --> 28:17.562
I can think of probably
a dozen federal lawyers

28:17.563 --> 28:18.905
that would disagree with that.

28:19.242 --> 28:21.119
He was never in any real danger.

28:21.319 --> 28:24.305
I removed the bullets from my clip.
My gun wasn't even loaded.

28:24.306 --> 28:26.135
Well, mine was.
Yeah. Well,

28:26.136 --> 28:27.935
I was pretty sure you
weren't gonna shoot me.

28:28.015 --> 28:30.169
You know, next time, I wouldn't be so sure.

28:33.452 --> 28:36.247
Detective, I understand
that you probably hate me.

28:36.940 --> 28:39.107
You have every right to, both of you.

28:39.279 --> 28:41.317
But my job isn't to make friends.

28:41.644 --> 28:43.704
It's to stop bad things from happening.

28:44.347 --> 28:46.458
And seeing as how we're
just a couple of hours away

28:46.459 --> 28:47.837
from a major terrorist event

28:47.838 --> 28:49.996
and we are basically back at square one...

28:52.458 --> 28:54.264
I could really use your help.

28:56.597 --> 28:57.576
Yes, sir.

29:05.369 --> 29:07.182
Man, does that guy take jackhole lessons

29:07.183 --> 29:08.621
or was he born that way?

29:09.382 --> 29:10.557
Neither.

29:11.476 --> 29:14.027
I asked my buddy at D.H.S. about him.

29:15.906 --> 29:18.330
Turns out his wife was killed on 9/11.

29:19.697 --> 29:21.945
She rode the second tower down.

29:22.816 --> 29:25.253
They were on the phone
together when it happened.

29:32.245 --> 29:33.453
He's right.

29:34.703 --> 29:37.523
If we don't get Radford to
talk, we're dead in the water.

29:40.742 --> 29:41.887
Maybe not.

29:42.106 --> 29:44.152
Okay, I need backpack detectors spread out

29:44.153 --> 29:45.610
to the ten most likely targets.

29:45.611 --> 29:47.355
Get the N.E.S.T. teams ready. Go.

29:47.761 --> 29:50.310
Where are we on Jamal and
Amir's coconspirators?

29:50.635 --> 29:51.894
Coconspirators?

29:51.895 --> 29:53.952
Why? We know that they're patsies.

29:53.953 --> 29:56.548
Remember what Radford said
about the bomb going off?

29:56.549 --> 29:58.310
He said we will find our terrorist.

29:58.503 --> 29:59.990
But with Jamal and Amir
out of the picture...

29:59.991 --> 30:01.390
They're gonna try to pin
it on someone else.

30:01.391 --> 30:03.074
Somebody related to them both.

30:03.517 --> 30:05.669
All right. Get locations
on all known associates

30:05.670 --> 30:07.724
of Amir and Jamal Alhabi.
I don't care

30:07.725 --> 30:09.084
if we've dismissed 'em before.

30:09.161 --> 30:11.314
Anybody of Middle-Eastern
origin or descent.

30:11.362 --> 30:14.865
Nazihah, Amir's wife,
find her, track her down.

30:14.866 --> 30:16.233
See if she'll cooperate.

30:16.234 --> 30:17.402
She trusts you. 
Maybe she

30:17.403 --> 30:19.221
can help us narrow down the list. 
On it.

30:27.793 --> 30:28.938
Beckett.

30:33.245 --> 30:34.817
That's Fallon's surveillance guy.

30:38.524 --> 30:39.772
Nazihah.

30:42.671 --> 30:44.083
Nazihah!

30:45.152 --> 30:46.639
Nazihah!

30:51.678 --> 30:54.153
She's gone. So is the kid.

30:54.535 --> 30:55.639
What?

30:55.787 --> 30:57.220
I found this on the table.

30:57.962 --> 30:59.669
"Allah Akbar. God is great.
I go to my glory

30:59.670 --> 31:01.724
against the forces of the infidel."

31:02.925 --> 31:04.773
She's their new terrorist.

31:05.143 --> 31:07.240
They're gonna have her set off the bomb.

31:10.482 --> 31:14.308
But none of them saw the abduction.
What about the traffic cams?

31:14.309 --> 31:16.509
I got teams out there, but
with less than two hours left,

31:16.510 --> 31:17.320
there's no time to go

31:17.321 --> 31:18.810
through all the footage.
Where's Montgomery?

31:18.811 --> 31:20.633
He's on the phone with one P.P. coordinating

31:20.634 --> 31:23.422
city emergency response
teams, just in case.

31:23.614 --> 31:25.986
Mobilize FEMA with full radiation protocol.

31:25.987 --> 31:29.252
Have 'em standing by to airlift to the city. 
Yes, sir.

31:29.674 --> 31:31.299
We found her phone at the house.

31:31.300 --> 31:34.314
The family car is out in front.
So we have no way to trace her.

31:34.543 --> 31:37.619
Yo. I got something. 
According to D.O.D.,

31:37.620 --> 31:40.127
most of the guys in Radford's
unit are still deployed.

31:40.377 --> 31:42.352
I was able to locate all but two...

31:42.353 --> 31:43.759
Evan Bauer and Jack Cochran.

31:43.760 --> 31:45.186
Their families say they've
been on a fishing trip

31:45.187 --> 31:47.028
since last week.
What do we know about them?

31:47.138 --> 31:48.878
Well, Bauer is a weapons specialist,

31:48.879 --> 31:51.676
and Cochran did a tour in
explosive ordinance disposal.

31:51.763 --> 31:53.623
An E.O.D. guy would know
how to build a bomb.

31:53.624 --> 31:54.924
All right. Get a team together.

31:55.153 --> 31:57.349
Crawl up these guys'
asses with a microscope.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.727
- Phone records, financials, anything...
Get a location. - Yeah.

32:06.069 --> 32:07.254
What's wrong?

32:07.448 --> 32:09.265
We find these guys, you
know what we're gonna see?

32:09.641 --> 32:10.801
Nothing.

32:11.201 --> 32:13.393
These aren't brainwashed radicalized kids

32:13.394 --> 32:14.416
on a student visa.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.983
This is highly trained military.

32:16.511 --> 32:18.261
They're probably reading
out of our playbook.

32:20.705 --> 32:22.538
We are running out of time.

32:24.206 --> 32:26.166
Get N.E.S.T. in the air. 
Yes, sir.

32:26.726 --> 32:28.454
Maybe we'll get lucky,

32:29.013 --> 32:31.068
the ground teams can make a move.

32:33.628 --> 32:34.944
There, uh...

32:35.193 --> 32:36.860
There might be another way.

32:39.093 --> 32:40.616
But, uh...

32:40.973 --> 32:42.857
I don't think you're gonna like it.

32:53.830 --> 32:55.249
Make the call.

33:03.303 --> 33:07.462
It's really very simple.
Do what we ask, everybody lives.

33:07.463 --> 33:09.442
Don't do what we ask, everybody dies.

33:09.443 --> 33:11.576
It's as easy as that.
You killed my husband.

33:11.577 --> 33:12.704
Why should I believe you?

33:12.705 --> 33:14.501
Because I'm afraid you
have no other choice.

33:14.997 --> 33:16.354
See the van?

33:16.545 --> 33:18.660
All you gotta do is drive it where we said,

33:18.661 --> 33:20.366
park it, and walk away.

33:20.927 --> 33:22.639
You do that for us, we'll return your baby,

33:22.640 --> 33:24.403
and we can all go on with our lives.

33:24.735 --> 33:27.447
But you should know, there's a
camera on the driver's side.

33:27.739 --> 33:30.784
If you do anything stupid, we'll know.

33:31.127 --> 33:33.095
Nod if you understand.

33:43.141 --> 33:44.345
Mr. Castle.

33:44.594 --> 33:45.753
Detective Beckett.

33:46.040 --> 33:47.507
So good to see you again.

33:47.508 --> 33:50.154
And, agent Fallon, your
reputation precedes you.

33:51.105 --> 33:53.708
Does the Syrian Consulate
even know you're here?

33:55.798 --> 33:56.936
When we last met,

33:57.031 --> 33:59.774
Detective Beckett, you
relieved me of my pistol.

33:59.775 --> 34:02.291
I thought now was a good
time to retrieve it.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.022
Mr. Yusef, when we last met,

34:07.276 --> 34:11.424
you told me it was in your
business to stay informed.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.257
I find, in my business,
it's important to...

34:15.458 --> 34:17.339
Keep up with current events.

34:17.610 --> 34:18.733
And I'm sure that your country

34:18.734 --> 34:20.754
would do everything in its power

34:20.755 --> 34:23.322
to avoid a terrible misunderstanding.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.351
If somehow Amir or his wife Nazihah

34:25.353 --> 34:28.757
were mistakenly believed to be involved

34:28.757 --> 34:31.496
in an act of domestic terrorism.

34:33.722 --> 34:36.053
I would say, it's in both our interests.

34:36.280 --> 34:38.831
You also mentioned that Amir was
of special interest to you.

34:40.367 --> 34:42.331
We at the Syrian Consulate

34:42.333 --> 34:44.359
wanted to make sure he liked his new home,

34:44.360 --> 34:46.614
so, yes.

34:46.614 --> 34:49.068
We checked in with him from time to time.

34:49.873 --> 34:52.187
And what about Nazihah,
did you check in on her?

34:52.639 --> 34:55.377
Under the circumstances, we
thought it would be appropriate

34:55.378 --> 34:56.739
to send our condolences.

34:56.741 --> 34:58.669
You had her under surveillance, didn't you?

34:59.023 --> 35:00.288
Where is she?

35:01.049 --> 35:03.318
Mr. Fallon, the Syrian Consulate

35:03.319 --> 35:05.219
is strictly a diplomatic mission.

35:08.595 --> 35:10.105
We're certainly not

35:10.484 --> 35:13.229
in the business of spying on U.S. citizens.

35:18.415 --> 35:20.013
However...

35:20.241 --> 35:23.484
If you were to happen by a red
brick industrial building

35:23.485 --> 35:26.694
on the corner of 158th Street and Franklin,

35:26.866 --> 35:29.089
I do not think you'd be wasting your time.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.316
Now if you'll excuse me,

35:31.317 --> 35:34.364
I have an appointment outside the city.

35:44.944 --> 35:46.018
That's her baby.

35:49.851 --> 35:51.036
The baby's fine.

35:51.211 --> 35:52.462
Where's Nazihah?

35:52.649 --> 35:55.113
Guys, over here.

36:14.066 --> 36:16.437
Camera frame is too tight.
We can't tell where she is.

36:16.438 --> 36:17.431
No way to get in touch with her,

36:17.432 --> 36:18.937
and let her know her baby's all right.

36:19.137 --> 36:20.916
Well, I guess it's all up to him.

36:23.875 --> 36:25.363
He knows we're on a deadline, right?

36:25.364 --> 36:28.185
Yeah, he knows.
I mean a literal deadline.

36:28.186 --> 36:29.507
As in, you go over the line, you're dead.

36:29.508 --> 36:31.023
Castle, can you just give him a chance?

36:31.024 --> 36:33.004
I-I'm happy to give him anything he needs.

36:33.005 --> 36:35.307
It's the clock that's not cooperating.
Alert all units.

36:35.308 --> 36:38.132
Target is in a black van.
Repeat, a black van.

36:38.133 --> 36:39.806
They left for Times Square ten minutes ago.

36:39.807 --> 36:41.944
How'd you get 'em to talk? 
I lied. I told 'em Radford cut a deal

36:41.945 --> 36:43.542
implicating them both.

36:43.543 --> 36:45.980
I want checkpoints and
barricades in Times Square.

36:45.981 --> 36:48.566
Get choppers in the air. Find that van.

36:48.567 --> 36:49.656
If she just left ten minutes ago,

36:49.657 --> 36:50.560
there's a chance we can catch her

36:50.561 --> 36:52.846
before she gets there.
Take Broadway or Riverside.

36:52.847 --> 36:54.218
We got Broadway.

37:01.821 --> 37:03.392
You should not have taken Broadway.

37:03.393 --> 37:05.219
It's the most direct route to Midtown.

37:05.220 --> 37:07.074
Yeah, but it's not the fastest.
We should cut over to...

37:07.075 --> 37:09.468
Castle, will you please stop
telling me how to drive?

37:09.469 --> 37:10.437
I'm not telling you how to drive...

37:10.438 --> 37:12.978
You are telling me how to drive.
Nazihah's husband was a cabbie.

37:12.979 --> 37:15.887
- So? - So Broadway slows down
in the 70s through Midtown.

37:15.888 --> 37:18.243
She would know that the fastest
way is West End to 11th

37:18.244 --> 37:19.897
and then cut crosstown on 48th.

37:19.898 --> 37:21.545
Okay, why 48th and not 46th?

37:21.546 --> 37:23.367
Because 46th has construction on it.
Turn here.

37:25.463 --> 37:26.766
All units, this is 23.

37:26.767 --> 37:29.421
We are tracking a black van
southbound on Broadway

37:29.422 --> 37:31.012
passing 72nd.

37:31.013 --> 37:33.457
I repeat, southbound on
Broadway, passing 72nd.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.416
Broadway.
I, uh...

37:35.417 --> 37:36.523
I'm turning around. 
No, no,

37:36.524 --> 37:37.601
don't turn around. It's the wrong van.

37:37.602 --> 37:38.774
Castle, how do you know?
 There!

37:38.775 --> 37:40.477
There! There! There! There! There! There!

37:45.051 --> 37:46.171
It's her.

37:48.886 --> 37:49.996
Pull over!

37:51.101 --> 37:52.990
Nazihah, pull over!

38:06.432 --> 38:08.629
Please, no. They have my baby.

38:08.630 --> 38:10.943
Nazihah, no. We've got her.
She's okay. She's o...

38:10.944 --> 38:12.211
Beckett.

38:19.253 --> 38:21.112
Dispatch, this is 1 Lincoln 40.

38:21.113 --> 38:23.278
We found the bomb on 55th and 11th.

38:23.279 --> 38:25.771
1 Lincoln 40, copy. Bomb squad is en route.

38:25.772 --> 38:27.165
E.T.A. three minutes.

38:29.532 --> 38:32.355
Dispatch, that's about
two minutes too late.

38:32.356 --> 38:34.203
1 Lincoln 40, stand by.

38:39.567 --> 38:40.213
Fallon.

38:40.214 --> 38:42.536
Fallon, you have any idea
how to defuse a bomb?

38:42.537 --> 38:44.281
One minute. 
Where are you?

38:44.282 --> 38:45.667
We're at 55th and 11th. 
No,

38:45.668 --> 38:47.670
I'd... I'd have to see it.
Can you send a picture?

38:47.671 --> 38:48.977
Yeah, yeah. Hold on.

38:53.667 --> 38:54.591
It's uploading right now.

38:54.592 --> 38:56.371
45 seconds. 
You got it.

38:56.372 --> 38:58.481
Yeah, it's opening... it's opening now.

39:03.455 --> 39:05.713
Fallon? 
Hang on!

39:07.023 --> 39:09.029
30 seconds. 
Fallon!

39:09.030 --> 39:10.987
I can't see anything!

39:12.343 --> 39:13.644
I'm sorry.

39:15.704 --> 39:17.625
I'm sorry.

39:24.159 --> 39:26.131
Castle...

39:46.082 --> 39:47.323
Oh...

39:47.850 --> 39:49.209
Castle.

39:49.288 --> 39:50.437
Oh!

39:53.345 --> 39:54.838
Oh!

39:56.730 --> 39:58.065
Yes!

40:06.531 --> 40:09.439
No, he... No, you should've seen his face,
because he stopped,

40:09.440 --> 40:11.810
he looked at me, he grabbed all the wires,

40:11.811 --> 40:13.531
and then he just yanked them.

40:14.932 --> 40:16.151
All of 'em?

40:16.381 --> 40:18.411
I figured one of 'em had
to be the right one.

40:18.412 --> 40:20.428
You know, the Mayor wants
to give you guys a medal.

40:20.719 --> 40:21.876
I didn't have the heart to tell him

40:21.877 --> 40:24.460
you had no clue what you were doing.
Thank you.

40:25.864 --> 40:27.032
The Captain's right.

40:27.932 --> 40:29.814
You guys don't know how lucky you are.

40:32.842 --> 40:34.099
Actually...

40:35.666 --> 40:37.275
I do.

40:42.160 --> 40:44.102
Could I talk to you two for a second?

40:53.934 --> 40:54.893
I just want you two to know

40:54.894 --> 40:56.910
the U.S. attorneys office
is gonna be charging them

40:56.911 --> 40:59.409
with multiple counts of
conspiracy to commit terror.

40:59.763 --> 41:02.420
And thanks to you two, 
we won't have to add

41:02.421 --> 41:04.864
the murder of innocent New Yorkers 
to that allegation.

41:04.865 --> 41:06.294
Well, we were just doing our job.

41:06.295 --> 41:07.573
Actually, I was doing my job. 
I don't know

41:07.574 --> 41:10.296
what the hell he was doing.
Hey. But that's true.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.834
Listen, um...

41:14.134 --> 41:17.751
What I do is not who I am.

41:18.811 --> 41:20.851
It's just how I have to be.

41:21.052 --> 41:22.923
I hope you both understand that.

41:23.078 --> 41:24.795
Why don't we just say it was a pleasure

41:24.796 --> 41:27.087
and that we hope that we
don't have to do it again?

41:27.556 --> 41:28.852
Fair enough.

41:30.373 --> 41:31.794
I-if it does happen again, though,

41:31.795 --> 41:34.432
maybe you could just text
me, have a code word.

41:34.619 --> 41:36.006
"Run."

41:39.380 --> 41:40.542
Hell of a day, huh?

41:40.543 --> 41:41.664
Hell of a day.

41:43.394 --> 41:44.692
You know...

41:46.050 --> 41:47.509
I was thinking.

41:48.902 --> 41:50.457
I was thinking maybe...

41:53.144 --> 41:55.297
I should go home,

41:56.062 --> 41:57.897
get some rest.

41:58.342 --> 41:59.816
Long day.

42:00.947 --> 42:02.190
Good night.

42:04.468 --> 42:06.131
Good night.

42:08.057 --> 42:09.614
Oh, hey.
