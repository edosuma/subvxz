01:29.497 --> 01:31.763
We've gotta be quick! Come on!

01:34.234 --> 01:35.836
Pa!

01:35.837 --> 01:37.970
Pa, wait up!

01:43.243 --> 01:45.045
Pa?

01:45.046 --> 01:47.546
Pa?

06:14.347 --> 06:18.617
- Pretty here, right?
- I guess.

06:19.953 --> 06:22.022
Oh, it won't be so bad.

06:22.023 --> 06:24.857
No rats here.

06:26.326 --> 06:29.329
That's 'cause the wolves eat 'em.

06:29.330 --> 06:33.133
You ain't afraid of
no wolves, are you?

06:33.134 --> 06:36.303
You worried you won't get to
see your girlfriend anymore?

06:36.304 --> 06:39.873
Katie ain't my girlfriend. I've
known her since I was seven.

06:39.874 --> 06:42.808
I've known your pa since
I was about that age.

06:45.879 --> 06:48.347
Where are you goin'?

06:54.187 --> 06:55.522
We're here.

06:55.523 --> 06:59.526
Good. I can use the help.

06:59.527 --> 07:02.529
Who else is workin'?

07:02.530 --> 07:04.696
Nobody.

07:06.066 --> 07:10.702
Y'all can get set up in
that trailer up the hill.

07:12.138 --> 07:14.841
Hey, Bud...

07:14.842 --> 07:16.843
I'm sorry about the plant closing.

07:16.844 --> 07:21.114
And I know that you weren't plannin'
on comin' back to these parts.

07:21.115 --> 07:24.317
I'm sorry about it, too.

07:24.318 --> 07:29.522
Uh, I saw your pa about
five or six years back,

07:29.523 --> 07:33.860
just before he died.
And he asked on you.

07:33.861 --> 07:36.929
I told him you were doing good.

07:38.331 --> 07:40.265
I was.

07:55.548 --> 07:58.850
Don't eat that one.

08:02.021 --> 08:04.523
Unless you like eatin' bugs.

08:15.268 --> 08:17.536
I don't like to waste.

08:19.406 --> 08:21.274
Who are you?

08:21.275 --> 08:25.178
Nobody. I just moved
here. Who are you?

08:25.179 --> 08:28.348
I live around here.

08:28.349 --> 08:31.184
I didn't think anybody
lived out here.

08:31.185 --> 08:33.385
Some people do.

08:34.453 --> 08:36.488
Eli!

08:41.394 --> 08:44.396
- What you doin' over there?
- Nothin'.

08:45.232 --> 08:47.099
Where'd you get that apple?

08:48.101 --> 08:49.136
Off the tree.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.371
That ain't your tree and
that ain't your apple.

08:51.372 --> 08:54.473
He can have an apple.
We got plenty.

08:58.511 --> 09:03.148
I catch you with an apple, boy,
you better bring a branch, too.

09:06.119 --> 09:09.122
- Who's this?
- This is Jesse.

09:09.123 --> 09:12.325
- Can I pet him?
- He's friendly.

09:12.326 --> 09:14.160
Hey, Bud. Hiya, buddy.

09:14.161 --> 09:15.562
Hi, Waylon.

09:15.563 --> 09:17.263
Ida!

09:17.264 --> 09:19.299
Long time.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.167
You look well.

09:33.480 --> 09:36.281
All right. Let us pray.

09:42.255 --> 09:46.659
Heavenly father, bless us, as we
trust not in the works of man,

09:46.660 --> 09:49.128
but only in your divine providence.

09:49.129 --> 09:53.733
Lead us not into sin and let us not stray
into the darkness which surrounds us.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.269
For the kingdom, the
power and the glory

09:56.270 --> 09:59.771
are yours forever and ever. Amen.

10:25.598 --> 10:28.568
Do you know who used to live here?

10:28.569 --> 10:30.503
No.

10:30.504 --> 10:34.240
Didn't take too good a care of it.

10:34.241 --> 10:36.508
We'll fix it up nice.

10:39.579 --> 10:43.049
Why'd he ever sell
off all those hogs?

10:43.050 --> 10:45.318
I don't know.

10:45.319 --> 10:47.986
Guess they cost more
than they made.

10:49.222 --> 10:52.125
Guess they run out of money.

10:52.126 --> 10:55.562
Do you know what he's gonna
do with all the buildings?

10:55.563 --> 10:58.565
Let 'em sit, I reckon.

10:58.566 --> 11:01.401
Don't go nosing in there.
It's dangerous.

11:50.817 --> 11:52.785
Somebody make dinner?

11:52.786 --> 11:55.453
There's no water.

11:56.689 --> 11:58.791
Did you ask Waylon about it?

11:58.792 --> 12:01.793
He don't want me talkin' to Waylon.

12:03.630 --> 12:05.231
Why not?

12:05.232 --> 12:07.700
Ask him.

12:07.701 --> 12:09.534
Aah!

12:20.246 --> 12:22.547
You come back here!

14:26.272 --> 14:27.872
Uhh!

14:38.785 --> 14:40.953
You scared the shit out of me, boy.

14:40.954 --> 14:43.422
Come on.

14:43.423 --> 14:45.790
Come on.

15:04.344 --> 15:06.811
Come on, boy. Come on, come on.

16:02.535 --> 16:05.104
A bull in a China shop.

16:05.105 --> 16:06.906
I... I'm sorry.

16:06.907 --> 16:09.575
What are you doin' in here?

16:09.576 --> 16:11.777
I was using the bathroom.

16:11.778 --> 16:13.679
In my office?

16:13.680 --> 16:17.450
No, in the bathroom.

16:17.451 --> 16:19.051
I'm really sorry about this.

16:19.052 --> 16:21.453
No harm.

16:24.490 --> 16:26.692
Where'd you get all these?

16:26.693 --> 16:30.161
From the farm. I've been digging
them up since I was a kid.

16:32.999 --> 16:35.101
They're still sharp.

16:35.102 --> 16:38.537
- You want it?
- No.

16:38.538 --> 16:40.171
Take it.

16:41.107 --> 16:43.975
Really?

17:10.102 --> 17:13.138
- Where you been?
- Bathroom.

17:13.140 --> 17:15.407
What's that?

17:15.409 --> 17:17.509
Waylon gave it to me.

17:20.980 --> 17:23.348
You look like a damn girl.

17:28.020 --> 17:30.455
Come on, help me with this.

18:11.097 --> 18:13.799
Who are you?

18:13.800 --> 18:16.535
Let me see Waylon.

18:16.536 --> 18:19.538
I asked you who <i>you </i> are.

18:19.539 --> 18:23.609
Hey, Bud. Thank you, Bud.

18:23.610 --> 18:26.779
Hey, Waylon. How's
the pig business?

18:26.780 --> 18:29.347
You mind if we talk in private?

18:34.920 --> 18:38.791
- This shit worth anything?
- To me.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.559
You know what's worth
something to me?

18:40.560 --> 18:41.994
Money.

18:41.995 --> 18:45.098
Then it's a good thing
you got so much.

18:45.099 --> 18:47.984
Well, the reason I got so much is,
I make sure I got what's owed me.

18:48.010 --> 18:51.937
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

18:51.938 --> 18:54.073
- So when are you gonna pay me?
- I'll pay you.

18:54.074 --> 18:56.976
Oh, I know you'll pay
me. I said, when?

18:56.977 --> 18:59.678
When I pay you.

19:01.248 --> 19:04.050
Don't make do something
about you, Waylon.

19:04.051 --> 19:07.820
If you don't pay me, I'm
gonna take this pretty farm.

19:07.821 --> 19:11.057
Why don't you just sell it? Lord
knows you ain't actually farming it.

19:11.058 --> 19:14.160
What's keeping you here, anyway?

19:14.161 --> 19:16.028
History.

19:16.029 --> 19:18.164
History.

19:18.165 --> 19:21.200
You keep living for the past,

19:21.201 --> 19:23.803
you ain't gonna have no future.

19:28.874 --> 19:31.075
You got two weeks.

19:32.011 --> 19:34.146
Have a good day.

19:34.147 --> 19:35.681
Why do you hate Waylon so much?

19:35.682 --> 19:38.751
He ain't trustworthy.

19:38.752 --> 19:43.087
- Then why are you workin' for him?
- You got any better ideas?

19:44.557 --> 19:48.894
- Were you two friends as kids?
- We played.

19:48.895 --> 19:51.063
Then what happened?

19:51.064 --> 19:53.566
Go see if your mother needs help.

19:54.267 --> 19:56.367
Go on, get!

20:11.284 --> 20:15.788
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay, boy.

20:17.458 --> 20:20.926
- He doesn't like you too much.
- I don't like him, either.

20:20.927 --> 20:23.028
Jesse? Why not?

20:23.029 --> 20:27.166
He kills the rabbits.
Bites their legs off.

20:27.167 --> 20:29.034
Oh.

20:29.035 --> 20:32.337
You wouldn't do a thing
like that, now, would you?

20:42.314 --> 20:44.250
Where'd you get that?

20:44.251 --> 20:47.019
Found it.

20:47.020 --> 20:49.587
It's yours, right?

20:50.990 --> 20:53.124
Finders keepers.

20:56.896 --> 20:58.898
What's your name?

20:58.899 --> 21:00.766
Amanda.

21:00.767 --> 21:03.568
Jesse!

21:14.246 --> 21:16.414
Come here, boy.

21:18.384 --> 21:21.018
What's this fence doing here?

21:24.390 --> 21:27.393
- Do you know what's back there?
- I don't know.

21:27.394 --> 21:30.262
Curious?

21:30.263 --> 21:32.597
It's private property.

21:33.832 --> 21:37.803
- Ain't it Waylon's land?
- No.

21:37.804 --> 21:40.271
Whose is it, then?

21:42.241 --> 21:43.876
I want to see.

21:43.877 --> 21:46.312
No.

21:46.313 --> 21:47.947
What?

21:47.948 --> 21:51.050
Leave it alone, all right?

21:51.051 --> 21:52.785
Why?

21:53.186 --> 21:56.054
Just promise me.

21:59.124 --> 22:02.226
All right. Promise.

22:31.123 --> 22:32.458
What?

22:32.459 --> 22:34.093
Huh?

22:34.094 --> 22:36.862
What are you lookin' at?

22:36.863 --> 22:40.866
Nothin'. Your shirt
has a tear in it.

22:40.867 --> 22:43.102
I know.

22:43.103 --> 22:45.838
Why don't you fix it?

22:45.839 --> 22:48.673
Who am I gonna impress?

22:50.209 --> 22:52.378
Me.

22:53.179 --> 22:56.949
What do you think of me now you
know my shirt's got a hole?

22:56.950 --> 22:59.083
I don't know.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.353
I like you.

23:07.926 --> 23:10.296
You go swimming in the lake yet?

23:10.297 --> 23:12.230
No.

23:14.033 --> 23:16.501
Meet me tomorrow?

24:17.129 --> 24:19.198
- Boo!
- Jesus, Katie...

24:19.199 --> 24:21.967
Eli?

24:21.968 --> 24:23.369
How'd you get out here?

24:23.370 --> 24:24.903
I stole the keys after
she went to bed.

24:24.904 --> 24:26.338
- Where'd you park?
- Down a ways.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.307
Nobody'll see it.

24:28.308 --> 24:29.774
This is crazy.

24:31.176 --> 24:33.379
What are you so worried about?

24:33.380 --> 24:36.415
You're basically grounded forever
just by living out here.

24:36.416 --> 24:38.549
Come on.

24:40.219 --> 24:43.088
I'm glad to see you.

24:43.089 --> 24:45.656
I think I've gone crazy out here.

24:47.926 --> 24:49.328
No, thanks.

24:49.329 --> 24:51.363
- It'll loosen you up.
- I'm plenty loose.

24:51.364 --> 24:54.199
Yeah, right. You're about as
loose as your mom's asshole.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.335
What have you been doing
in my mom's asshole?

24:56.336 --> 24:59.171
Look, just take a sip.

24:59.172 --> 25:02.074
It makes you happy, farm boy. When was
the last time you could say that?

25:02.075 --> 25:04.643
I don't like it.

25:04.644 --> 25:07.345
But it likes you.

25:08.580 --> 25:10.516
Come on, now. What are you...

25:10.517 --> 25:12.885
pa's gonna think I got in his.
Why do you do that?

25:12.886 --> 25:15.753
Don't get up. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to.

25:23.128 --> 25:25.431
You look cute when you're mad.

25:25.432 --> 25:27.232
You don't look too cute
when I'm mad, so...

25:27.233 --> 25:28.866
Oh!

25:31.170 --> 25:32.571
What?

25:45.017 --> 25:47.386
Why don't you kiss me?

25:47.387 --> 25:50.321
It's not a sin if I'm drunk.

25:57.663 --> 25:59.964
You're just chicken, kid.

26:04.269 --> 26:07.272
You start believing in hell all
of a sudden, or something?

26:07.273 --> 26:10.476
I think I might already be there.

26:10.477 --> 26:13.212
Nice to see you, too.

26:13.213 --> 26:15.980
I don't mean you, okay?

28:09.795 --> 28:11.363
Morning.

28:11.364 --> 28:12.798
Where were you?

28:12.799 --> 28:15.300
- Pissing.
- Where were you?

28:15.301 --> 28:17.569
The field.

28:17.570 --> 28:20.472
Do you want to go for a walk?

28:20.473 --> 28:23.775
Don't you have to get
the car back, or...

28:23.776 --> 28:27.144
It's Saturday. They won't
get up till 1:00 or 2:00.

28:29.548 --> 28:32.117
So does anyone else live out here?

28:32.118 --> 28:34.620
Heh. Uh, no.

28:34.621 --> 28:37.489
I bet a bunch of inbred
rednecks live out here.

28:45.163 --> 28:46.964
What?

28:48.767 --> 28:49.802
What?

28:49.803 --> 28:52.337
What do you keep
looking around for?

28:52.438 --> 28:55.140
Um... Me? Nothin'.

28:55.141 --> 28:58.343
- Are there bears out here?
- No.

28:58.344 --> 29:01.480
- Do you want to go back?
- No, I'm having fun.

29:01.481 --> 29:03.581
Yeah, you're a riot.

29:05.217 --> 29:08.253
- Where are you going?
- Shortcut.

29:08.254 --> 29:10.422
Shortcut to us being lost?

29:10.423 --> 29:13.557
We cut straight through these
woods, we'll hit the farm.

29:28.874 --> 29:30.542
Whoa.

29:30.543 --> 29:33.177
- You see this before?
- No.

29:44.623 --> 29:46.658
Hey, what are you doing?

29:46.659 --> 29:48.427
You chicken?

29:48.428 --> 29:50.228
No, but what if it's
somebody's house?

29:50.229 --> 29:52.229
Are you kidding me?
No one lives here.

29:58.537 --> 30:00.170
Aah!

30:05.676 --> 30:07.778
What are you doing?

30:13.418 --> 30:16.888
- It's fake.
- What?

30:16.889 --> 30:19.624
Yeah, it's straw. It's fake.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.659
Oh, my God.

30:22.594 --> 30:24.396
Freakin' scarecrow.

30:24.397 --> 30:26.131
Scared <i>you </i> pretty good, old crow.

30:26.132 --> 30:27.966
Bite me.

30:28.267 --> 30:31.837
Some kids probably put
it up as a prank.

30:31.838 --> 30:34.672
Can we get out of here?

31:10.842 --> 31:12.776
Hey.

31:14.279 --> 31:16.580
You came.

31:27.826 --> 31:29.995
Who else comes here?

31:29.996 --> 31:31.530
No one.

31:31.531 --> 31:32.964
Never?

31:32.965 --> 31:34.798
No.

31:42.674 --> 31:44.643
What are you doing?

31:44.644 --> 31:46.511
I don't want to get my clothes wet.

31:46.512 --> 31:48.980
So you're just gonna take 'em off?

31:48.981 --> 31:51.248
You never seen a girl out
of her clothes before?

31:52.851 --> 31:54.619
Heh.

31:54.620 --> 31:58.022
Are you religious?
'Cause I don't have to.

31:59.057 --> 32:01.860
I don't want Jesus mad at me.

32:01.861 --> 32:04.628
Jesus don't stay mad too long.

32:31.591 --> 32:33.757
You can look now.

32:36.628 --> 32:38.663
Aren't you gonna come in?

32:38.664 --> 32:40.365
I don't know.

32:40.366 --> 32:43.435
You don't have to if it's a sin.

32:43.436 --> 32:45.837
Sinning don't bother me.

32:45.838 --> 32:48.272
Well, what are you
waiting for, then?

32:49.541 --> 32:51.675
Cover your eyes.

33:05.391 --> 33:07.058
Can I look now?

33:07.059 --> 33:08.892
Yeah.

33:10.762 --> 33:12.664
How's it feel?

33:12.665 --> 33:14.966
Good.

33:14.967 --> 33:17.636
You swim like this with
other boys before?

33:17.637 --> 33:21.573
Just my brother, when we were kids.

33:21.574 --> 33:23.975
You have a brother?

33:23.976 --> 33:26.176
I had one.

33:37.023 --> 33:39.356
Aah!

33:42.093 --> 33:44.328
Are you shy?

33:46.965 --> 33:49.167
You shouldn't be.

33:49.168 --> 33:50.902
Why not?

33:50.903 --> 33:53.405
I don't bite.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.441
I don't know if I believe you.

34:03.615 --> 34:05.517
You want to come over

34:05.518 --> 34:07.885
and watch a movie
sometime or something?

34:10.554 --> 34:12.190
We don't bite, either.

34:12.190 --> 34:13.958
My pa does a little
bit, maybe, but...

34:13.960 --> 34:16.661
what does he do?

34:16.661 --> 34:18.762
Nothin'.

34:20.197 --> 34:22.534
Did he hit you?

34:22.534 --> 34:25.135
No, no. No, not really.

34:27.138 --> 34:30.175
He didn't start out that way.

34:30.176 --> 34:32.809
How do you know that?

34:34.179 --> 34:36.980
Nobody starts out bad.

34:47.726 --> 34:51.195
You mind turning off the
shit-mobile for a minute?

34:58.036 --> 35:00.805
- How's things goin'?
- Fine.

35:00.806 --> 35:04.642
You have any idea when that tobacco
crop might be ready to sell?

35:04.643 --> 35:06.544
It'll be a while yet.

35:06.545 --> 35:09.781
We need to turn that into
cash as soon as we can.

35:09.782 --> 35:11.716
Can't rush nature.

35:11.717 --> 35:13.718
Where's Eli? Shouldn't
he be helpin' out?

35:13.719 --> 35:16.221
You think I'll end up good or bad?

35:16.222 --> 35:19.024
I don't know. It depends.

35:19.025 --> 35:20.492
On what?

35:20.493 --> 35:21.993
Bad things happen.

35:21.994 --> 35:25.128
If you're weak, it'll break you.

35:26.197 --> 35:28.599
I'm not weak.

35:31.269 --> 35:33.303
I'm not.

35:41.980 --> 35:44.381
I don't get you.

35:47.752 --> 35:50.420
You got me if you want me.

36:23.755 --> 36:26.223
Come here, Eli.

36:29.294 --> 36:31.596
You been out in the woods much?

36:31.597 --> 36:32.931
Yeah.

36:32.932 --> 36:36.201
Seen any trespassers?

36:36.202 --> 36:38.803
No.

36:38.804 --> 36:41.940
Well, you see any, you let me know.

36:41.941 --> 36:43.908
Okay.

36:43.909 --> 36:46.211
What you doin' in there?

36:46.212 --> 36:48.179
Nothin'.

36:48.180 --> 36:51.716
Well, as long as you
ain't settin' fires

36:51.717 --> 36:53.318
and cuttin' up trees.

36:53.319 --> 36:55.253
I got more respect
than that. Come on, now.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.821
Good.

36:56.822 --> 36:59.958
You know, there's a lot of history.

36:59.959 --> 37:01.960
The civil war was fought here.

37:01.961 --> 37:04.696
Pioneers died here.

37:04.697 --> 37:07.999
Underground railroad
even came through here.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.835
- Really?
- Yeah.

37:10.836 --> 37:15.072
Come here. Let me
show you something.

37:16.774 --> 37:18.710
- See these shoes?
- Yeah.

37:18.711 --> 37:21.212
These belonged to a runaway slave

37:21.213 --> 37:24.215
by the name of Barnaby.

37:24.216 --> 37:27.831
My great-great-grandfather
John tried to help him...

37:27.857 --> 37:31.301
let him sleep in a barn.
But then his father...

37:31.327 --> 37:34.192
my great-great-great-
grandfather Horace...

37:34.193 --> 37:36.327
got a hold of old Barnaby

37:36.328 --> 37:40.798
and took him out deep,
deep into the woods

37:40.799 --> 37:43.101
and hung him from a tree.

37:43.102 --> 37:45.336
Told John what he did,

37:45.337 --> 37:48.806
but wouldn't tell him where.

37:48.807 --> 37:52.143
Gave him the poor boy's
shoes to prove it.

37:52.144 --> 37:56.047
Of course, now they're
both a part of the farm.

37:56.048 --> 37:58.116
And so is he.

37:58.117 --> 38:00.685
Of course... heh heh...

38:00.686 --> 38:04.088
John never did find the body.

38:04.889 --> 38:06.991
Where did you get all the guns?

38:06.992 --> 38:10.361
Oh, mostly collected by father and
my grandfather over the years.

38:10.362 --> 38:12.197
They're worth something.

38:12.198 --> 38:14.432
So don't you be taking
them hunting or nothin'.

38:14.433 --> 38:18.269
You ever gonna sell
any of this stuff?

38:18.270 --> 38:22.038
Those I'm taking
with me to my grave.

38:33.851 --> 38:37.055
Waylon, did you ever know
of anybody named Amanda?

38:37.056 --> 38:39.190
Why do you ask?

38:39.191 --> 38:41.291
Oh, I'm just wondering.

38:42.393 --> 38:45.328
Did you see her?

38:46.764 --> 38:48.466
Yeah.

38:48.467 --> 38:50.868
Where? Where did you see her?

38:50.869 --> 38:53.037
- I don't know...
- Did she say anything to you?

38:53.038 --> 38:54.439
What'd she say?

38:54.440 --> 38:57.842
Nothin' much. Who is she?

38:57.843 --> 38:59.978
Boy...

38:59.979 --> 39:02.413
You stay away from her.

39:02.414 --> 39:04.349
She's dangerous.

39:04.350 --> 39:06.251
All right.

39:06.252 --> 39:09.352
And if you see her
again, you tell me.

39:11.089 --> 39:12.457
Okay?

39:12.458 --> 39:14.391
Yeah.

39:16.494 --> 39:18.829
Good.

39:36.514 --> 39:38.950
- Where'd you go?
- Nowhere.

39:38.951 --> 39:41.519
- Who were you with?
- No one.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.188
So you were nowhere with no one...

39:43.189 --> 39:45.523
- I guess doing nothin', huh?
- Yeah.

39:45.524 --> 39:47.458
Know what I was doin'?

39:47.459 --> 39:50.295
I was workin' my ass off while
you were doing nothin'.

39:50.296 --> 39:52.930
You were supposed to
spray the tobacco.

39:52.931 --> 39:56.768
I can't trust you with nothin'. Were
you with that city girl... Katie?

39:56.769 --> 39:58.468
Are you drunk?

40:00.004 --> 40:03.141
You won't be so smart when
you're burnin' in hell.

40:03.142 --> 40:06.276
At least I'll have you
for some company.

40:14.485 --> 40:16.586
Eli!

40:19.357 --> 40:22.093
What are you doing out here?

40:22.094 --> 40:24.294
He's drinking.

40:25.530 --> 40:27.198
Yeah, I know.

40:27.199 --> 40:29.299
What's that?

40:32.470 --> 40:34.704
What was it?

40:35.940 --> 40:37.774
A lamp.

40:38.976 --> 40:41.144
Bastard can rot in the dark.

40:42.847 --> 40:44.215
I'm sorry.

40:46.585 --> 40:48.986
Hey, buddy.

40:48.987 --> 40:51.721
Hey, Bud.

40:54.859 --> 40:57.627
You ain't so scary, huh?

41:00.098 --> 41:02.766
Come on, let's go for
a walk, huh? Come on.

41:10.441 --> 41:12.576
Come on, buddy.

41:24.956 --> 41:27.824
Must be a lot of rabbits
in there, huh, boy?

41:41.939 --> 41:43.740
Here.

41:46.277 --> 41:48.045
Here, Jesse, boy.

41:48.046 --> 41:50.614
Through here.

43:19.136 --> 43:21.871
You promised.

43:28.045 --> 43:30.181
Liar! Liar!

43:30.182 --> 43:33.616
Liar! Liar!

43:49.500 --> 43:51.501
Jesse!

44:46.123 --> 44:49.092
Why didn't you listen to me?

46:05.836 --> 46:08.638
You don't have to work today.

46:12.810 --> 46:18.081
- Bud, tell him he doesn't have to work...
- It's okay, ma. I feel like workin'.

46:19.850 --> 46:21.851
Bud?

46:23.921 --> 46:26.990
If he wants to work, let him work.

46:32.296 --> 46:34.331
<i>Children</i>

46:34.332 --> 46:38.167
<i>Children see</i>

46:41.272 --> 46:45.209
<i>By strength, by will</i>

46:45.210 --> 46:47.877
<i>By stars</i>

47:18.776 --> 47:20.877
Amanda?

47:34.859 --> 47:37.226
I don't care what you are.

47:49.006 --> 47:51.341
Amanda, come out and talk to me.

47:54.578 --> 47:56.813
I'm sorry!

47:59.550 --> 48:02.618
I shouldn't have hopped
over that fence!

48:07.992 --> 48:10.360
Please just talk to me.

48:13.264 --> 48:15.798
Tell me what happened to you.

48:27.411 --> 48:29.345
Mornin'.

48:30.848 --> 48:32.749
Mornin'.

48:42.593 --> 48:45.928
Pa, did Waylon ever have
any siblings growing up?

48:48.032 --> 48:50.401
No.

48:50.402 --> 48:52.469
What are you lying for?

48:52.470 --> 48:55.573
Waylon had a sister.

48:55.574 --> 49:00.010
- What was her name?
- Amanda.

49:00.011 --> 49:02.380
She and your papa were sweethearts
before we got together.

49:02.381 --> 49:04.982
That's enough.

49:04.983 --> 49:07.518
They were set to run off together,
but she ran off on her own.

49:07.519 --> 49:09.854
I said that's enough.

49:09.855 --> 49:12.055
I don't think she ran off, pa.

49:18.729 --> 49:21.397
I found her body.

49:40.885 --> 49:43.453
Get your damn hand off me.

49:53.364 --> 49:55.164
Hey.

50:02.406 --> 50:04.041
What are you doing here?

50:04.042 --> 50:06.076
I snuck out here. I'm grounded.

50:06.677 --> 50:09.813
- What did you do?
- I called Mark a dickwad.

50:09.814 --> 50:11.815
Well, he is a dickwad. How could
you get in trouble for that?

50:11.816 --> 50:13.550
Right?

50:13.551 --> 50:17.021
God, I hate them so much.

50:17.022 --> 50:19.623
At least Mark isn't your real dad.

50:21.426 --> 50:24.561
Let's run away.

50:24.562 --> 50:26.463
Where do you want to go?

50:26.464 --> 50:28.732
- Dallas.
- Dallas? Why?

50:28.733 --> 50:31.035
Mark hates the cowboys.

50:31.036 --> 50:33.437
I don't know.

50:33.438 --> 50:37.107
I just want to leave this goddamn
place, go back to the city.

50:37.108 --> 50:39.043
Where do you want to go?

50:39.044 --> 50:41.412
Do you have any money?

50:41.413 --> 50:42.613
You're serious?

50:42.614 --> 50:44.280
Dead serious.

50:46.483 --> 50:48.986
Come on. Let's just drive.

50:48.987 --> 50:50.821
We can go to, like, louisville,

50:50.822 --> 50:54.058
live in the car until
we find an apartment.

50:54.059 --> 50:56.827
- I have $257...
- I can't.

50:56.828 --> 50:59.495
Why not? Don't you hate it here?

51:01.865 --> 51:03.933
I can't, Katie.

51:07.738 --> 51:09.907
What the hell am I supposed to do?

51:09.908 --> 51:11.974
If you have to run...

51:15.045 --> 51:17.146
Run.

51:23.954 --> 51:26.455
You lookin' for someone?

51:28.692 --> 51:30.861
Are you following me?

51:30.862 --> 51:34.797
These are my woods, boy.
I go where I want.

51:36.033 --> 51:39.136
I thought I told you
to stay away from her.

51:39.137 --> 51:41.672
She was your sister.

51:41.673 --> 51:44.340
I know who she was.

51:46.744 --> 51:49.512
Well, I'll just stay
away from her, then.

52:18.108 --> 52:21.277
She's a murderer.

52:28.018 --> 52:30.754
Bud?

52:30.755 --> 52:32.855
It's me, ma.

53:33.516 --> 53:35.884
Evening, Bud.

53:37.754 --> 53:41.024
I always thought she run out on me.

53:41.025 --> 53:43.227
But she didn't.

53:43.228 --> 53:46.597
Why don't you put
that pitchfork down?

53:46.598 --> 53:51.001
What kind of demon are you,
to do that to a harmless little girl?

53:51.002 --> 53:55.137
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- You know damn well what I'm talkin' about!

53:58.041 --> 54:02.533
- She was gonna leave me.
- So you hung her by the neck?

54:02.659 --> 54:04.172
Your own sister?

54:06.183 --> 54:07.985
Did you rape her? Did you?!

54:07.986 --> 54:10.187
God!

54:14.958 --> 54:17.294
I loved her.

54:17.295 --> 54:19.129
I had to protect her.

54:19.130 --> 54:21.064
Protect her?

54:21.065 --> 54:23.400
I kept her safe.

54:46.757 --> 54:48.591
Aaaah!

55:32.769 --> 55:34.771
That girl's been haunting
me my whole life.

55:34.772 --> 55:37.140
Now she finally took him from me.

55:37.141 --> 55:40.344
He always wanted her over me.

55:40.345 --> 55:43.714
Now he died over her.

55:43.715 --> 55:46.250
What do I got left?

55:46.251 --> 55:49.385
I'm sorry about your loss.

55:55.292 --> 55:58.160
What was his last words?

55:59.830 --> 56:02.231
He said he loved you, ma.

56:04.334 --> 56:06.737
Don't you stand beside
your father's grave

56:06.738 --> 56:08.671
and lie to me.

56:14.378 --> 56:17.179
He said, "kill him."

56:18.982 --> 56:21.084
Why don't you, uh...

56:21.085 --> 56:23.320
Go inside and get cleaned up?

56:23.321 --> 56:26.322
I'm gonna fix us all some dinner.

56:30.093 --> 56:32.228
Thank you, Waylon.

56:35.766 --> 56:39.235
Eli, would you take a walk with me?

56:51.181 --> 56:54.985
I'm sure that that
service wasn't free.

56:54.986 --> 56:58.088
And I know y'all don't
have much money.

56:58.089 --> 57:00.023
Believe it or not, I ain't exactly

57:00.024 --> 57:03.260
too fat in the hip
myself, neither, but...

57:03.261 --> 57:05.829
I wanted you to have this

57:05.830 --> 57:07.663
to help out as I could.

57:09.166 --> 57:11.234
I'll be sure to give it to ma.

57:11.235 --> 57:13.103
Well, you gotta take
care of her now.

57:13.104 --> 57:14.971
You're the man.

57:14.972 --> 57:17.840
Ain't nobody gonna protect
your family but you.

57:20.177 --> 57:22.546
You know what happened
up there with your pa

57:22.547 --> 57:23.980
was an accident, right?

57:23.981 --> 57:25.582
Sure.

57:25.583 --> 57:27.984
He come at me for something
he believed I'd done,

57:27.985 --> 57:30.954
and I didn't have no choice
but to protect myself.

57:30.955 --> 57:35.359
- You saying you didn't do it?
- No. No, sir, I ain't sayin' that.

57:35.360 --> 57:38.195
But maybe I had a good reason.

57:38.196 --> 57:40.430
That man in the hole in the ground,

57:40.431 --> 57:44.300
the man she killed...
that was our father.

59:14.592 --> 59:18.495
I... I thought you had gone.

59:18.496 --> 59:20.796
No, I didn't.

59:22.232 --> 59:24.701
Are you cold?

59:24.702 --> 59:27.103
No.

59:27.104 --> 59:29.473
No.

59:29.474 --> 59:31.540
Sorry.

59:43.220 --> 59:45.954
Everything's going so fast.

59:48.291 --> 59:51.694
And I just feel so left alone.

59:56.399 --> 01:00:01.538
I need someone to take care of me.

01:00:01.539 --> 01:00:03.974
You got Eli...

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:06.642
And you got me.

01:00:31.735 --> 01:00:33.403
You think I'm ugly.

01:00:33.404 --> 01:00:35.505
No, I don't.

01:00:35.506 --> 01:00:39.042
You think I'm pathetic.

01:00:39.043 --> 01:00:41.510
I feel sorry for you.

01:00:47.384 --> 01:00:50.453
Well, then...

01:00:50.454 --> 01:00:53.522
Take pity on me.

01:00:54.758 --> 01:00:57.427
I am way...

01:00:57.428 --> 01:01:01.063
Way more pathetic than
you'll ever be, Ida.

01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:08.103
Eli.

01:01:18.214 --> 01:01:20.048
Eli?

01:01:44.641 --> 01:01:46.708
Eli?

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:10.233
Aah! Waylon, hurry!

01:02:10.234 --> 01:02:14.503
Joe, Joe, put her down.
Put her down.

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:18.508
Mr. Peterson wants
his money, Waylon.

01:02:18.509 --> 01:02:20.210
Your time ran out.

01:02:20.211 --> 01:02:21.411
He'll get it.

01:02:21.412 --> 01:02:22.679
He wants it now.

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.881
I don't have it now.

01:02:24.882 --> 01:02:26.816
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

01:02:26.817 --> 01:02:29.119
Uhh!

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:32.188
You got three days until we
come back and take this farm

01:02:32.189 --> 01:02:34.957
and you wind up at the
bottom of the lake.

01:02:42.632 --> 01:02:45.934
Damn! Ohh!

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.838
Eli: Amanda!

01:02:48.839 --> 01:02:51.874
Amanda, come out and talk to me!

01:03:47.964 --> 01:03:50.532
You're alive.

01:03:51.835 --> 01:03:54.836
You're not scared of me?

01:03:56.306 --> 01:03:58.774
Should I be?

01:04:00.343 --> 01:04:02.312
No.

01:04:28.738 --> 01:04:30.607
Is Eli here?

01:04:30.608 --> 01:04:31.808
No.

01:04:31.809 --> 01:04:33.977
Know when he'll be back?

01:04:33.978 --> 01:04:35.912
I'm sorry.

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:37.914
Can you tell him Katie took off,

01:04:37.915 --> 01:04:40.615
and if he wants to find me...

01:04:42.285 --> 01:04:44.320
I guess tough shit.

01:04:44.321 --> 01:04:46.989
Yeah, I'll tell him.

01:04:52.695 --> 01:04:54.264
Who was that?

01:04:54.265 --> 01:04:57.333
It's a friend of Eli's.

01:04:57.334 --> 01:05:01.838
Who are those people
you owe money to?

01:05:01.839 --> 01:05:04.841
The local bank.

01:05:04.842 --> 01:05:07.710
They sure don't act like
any bankers I ever seen.

01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:11.146
Well, they ain't exactly F.D.I.C.

01:05:45.782 --> 01:05:48.985
I have more boxes in the truck.

01:05:48.986 --> 01:05:50.787
May I?

01:05:50.788 --> 01:05:52.854
Go ahead.

01:05:55.491 --> 01:05:57.861
Holy God. You know what this is?

01:05:57.862 --> 01:06:00.830
My great-great-granddaddy pulled
that off a dead union troop

01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:04.767
in his cornfield before he burned him.
Of course I know what that is.

01:06:05.368 --> 01:06:09.337
- Did you find him?
- Waylon showed me.

01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:13.643
What'd he do to you?

01:06:13.644 --> 01:06:15.945
Him?

01:06:15.946 --> 01:06:18.080
Nothin'.

01:06:19.682 --> 01:06:22.519
Waylon said he was your father
and that you killed him.

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:25.455
I didn't kill my father.

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:30.460
He died in a hunting
accident when we were kids.

01:06:30.461 --> 01:06:33.061
Waylon shot him.

01:06:35.598 --> 01:06:38.068
But this isn't him.

01:06:38.769 --> 01:06:42.605
- Well, who's this?
- This is Barnaby.

01:06:42.606 --> 01:06:45.373
He was a runaway slave.

01:06:48.444 --> 01:06:51.346
Waylon has his shoes.

01:06:55.352 --> 01:07:00.288
- I thought he was hung.
- He was.

01:07:00.289 --> 01:07:02.525
On the same tree where I hang.

01:07:03.026 --> 01:07:07.262
And he wandered the woods
the same way I do.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:15.904
Waylon made me watch as
he cut Barnaby down.

01:07:17.807 --> 01:07:21.577
What happened to him when
Waylon cut him down?

01:07:21.578 --> 01:07:24.180
He disappeared...

01:07:24.181 --> 01:07:26.815
Into nothin'.

01:07:42.865 --> 01:07:45.635
Are we safe here?

01:07:45.636 --> 01:07:47.802
I don't know.

01:08:18.134 --> 01:08:20.069
You good at horse?

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:22.437
Not really.

01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:27.010
- Oh!
- Mmm?

01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:29.145
- Shit.
- Ha ha!

01:08:29.145 --> 01:08:32.515
Did you ever see anybody
else out here before me?

01:08:32.515 --> 01:08:35.685
Just hikers, mostly.
Or trespassers.

01:08:35.685 --> 01:08:37.920
Did you ever spook anyone?

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:42.125
- Maybe once.
- What happened?

01:08:42.126 --> 01:08:46.496
Oh, it was just some
kids up to no good.

01:08:46.497 --> 01:08:48.731
That car outside...

01:08:48.732 --> 01:08:50.933
I turned it on.

01:08:50.934 --> 01:08:54.069
I bet they looked like
they'd seen a ghost.

01:09:10.019 --> 01:09:12.120
You know what I miss?

01:09:13.756 --> 01:09:16.358
Dancing.

01:09:35.645 --> 01:09:38.345
I've always thought I
wanted to run away.

01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:45.854
Now I want to stay here forever.

01:09:45.856 --> 01:09:48.256
Become like you.

01:09:52.595 --> 01:09:55.231
You can't.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:57.599
Why not?

01:09:59.168 --> 01:10:01.970
I need you to protect me.

01:10:03.873 --> 01:10:06.308
Do you promise?

01:10:35.905 --> 01:10:37.572
Where is she?

01:10:39.675 --> 01:10:41.844
I don't know.

01:10:41.845 --> 01:10:45.715
You were just talkin'
to her. I heard you.

01:10:45.716 --> 01:10:48.316
I was talkin' to myself.

01:10:49.819 --> 01:10:54.190
I will cut her down if
she don't talk to me.

01:10:54.191 --> 01:10:56.257
You wouldn't do that.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:01.731
I will slice you like a pig,

01:11:01.732 --> 01:11:03.933
you get in my way, boy.

01:11:04.134 --> 01:11:06.568
Waylon?

01:11:22.084 --> 01:11:23.886
Can I touch you?

01:11:24.687 --> 01:11:27.488
What do you want?

01:11:27.957 --> 01:11:30.927
I want to tell you I'm sorry.

01:11:31.128 --> 01:11:35.965
- And I want for you to forgive me.
- You did something unforgivable.

01:11:35.966 --> 01:11:39.168
- I was so young.
- I was younger.

01:11:39.169 --> 01:11:41.971
But you... you were gonna leave.

01:11:41.972 --> 01:11:44.740
How can I protect you if
you were gonna leave?

01:11:44.741 --> 01:11:46.910
I wasn't yours to protect.

01:11:46.911 --> 01:11:50.179
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.648
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:11:58.454 --> 01:12:01.022
Oh, no. No!

01:12:13.269 --> 01:12:15.137
Go.

01:12:15.138 --> 01:12:16.939
Go on, go.

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.374
Go on, get.

01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:34.122
Go, go, go!

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.365
Go!

01:12:58.914 --> 01:13:01.683
Stay here. You stay here.

01:13:06.188 --> 01:13:09.491
Waylon, I can't let you do this.

01:13:23.339 --> 01:13:25.340
Uhh!

01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:28.277
God!

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:35.116
You love her... Don't you?!
She love you, too?

01:13:40.456 --> 01:13:43.191
Like father, like son.

01:14:34.944 --> 01:14:36.579
He's chasing me.

01:14:36.580 --> 01:14:40.248
- Where is he?
- Everywhere.

01:14:51.828 --> 01:14:53.861
Amanda.

01:15:36.272 --> 01:15:38.708
Eli!

01:15:39.009 --> 01:15:40.910
Cut him down!

01:15:41.611 --> 01:15:44.278
I can't. He's on the same rope.

01:15:53.189 --> 01:15:55.456
Shit.

01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:03.464
Aah!

01:16:05.935 --> 01:16:08.670
Aaah!

01:16:13.943 --> 01:16:16.644
Cut him down!

01:16:24.253 --> 01:16:27.223
If you love me...

01:16:27.224 --> 01:16:29.891
Kill me.

01:16:36.198 --> 01:16:38.433
Please!

01:16:51.614 --> 01:16:54.048
<i>Who knows the things</i>

01:16:55.451 --> 01:16:59.087
<i>Oh, one who knows?</i>

01:17:01.190 --> 01:17:04.325
<i>What are you dreaming of?</i>

01:17:05.594 --> 01:17:10.199
<i>Of opened rest?</i>

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:12.134
<i>Girl</i>

01:17:12.135 --> 01:17:17.139
<i>where did you stay so long, girl?</i>

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:22.278
<i>Where did you stay so long?</i>

01:17:22.279 --> 01:17:25.714
<i>I feel strong</i>

01:17:25.715 --> 01:17:28.484
<i>The answer she gave</i>

01:17:28.485 --> 01:17:32.120
<i>Simply was</i>

01:17:34.223 --> 01:17:36.792
<i>I'll show you</i>

01:17:36.793 --> 01:17:40.462
<i>Where the lilies grow</i>

01:17:40.463 --> 01:17:43.732
<i>At the banks...</i>

01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:55.544
Where's Waylon?

01:17:55.545 --> 01:17:57.813
- Gone.
- Gone where?

01:17:57.814 --> 01:18:00.316
I don't know.

01:18:00.317 --> 01:18:03.352
When'll he be back?

01:18:03.353 --> 01:18:05.920
I don't think he will.

01:18:11.627 --> 01:18:14.796
Well, did he happen to leave
anything here for me?

01:18:24.373 --> 01:18:26.874
That's for you.

01:18:37.319 --> 01:18:39.821
Looks like you been in a scrape.

01:18:40.823 --> 01:18:43.192
Am I about to get into another?

01:18:43.193 --> 01:18:45.294
No, sir.

01:18:45.295 --> 01:18:47.862
Y'all have a good day.

01:18:53.836 --> 01:18:56.338
What'd they want?

01:18:56.339 --> 01:18:57.673
Their money.

01:18:57.674 --> 01:18:59.241
They get it?

01:18:59.242 --> 01:19:01.210
What happened to you?

01:19:01.211 --> 01:19:03.778
I fell down the stairs.

01:19:04.647 --> 01:19:07.249
What's all this?

01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:08.884
Waylon ran off.

01:19:08.885 --> 01:19:11.820
It says he left me the farm.

01:19:11.821 --> 01:19:14.490
I mean, why would he just run off?

01:19:14.491 --> 01:19:16.825
People run off all the time.

01:19:16.826 --> 01:19:19.161
You don't sound surprised.

01:19:29.138 --> 01:19:34.576
<i>I want to</i>

01:19:34.577 --> 01:19:40.615
<i>I want to know...</i>

01:19:42.418 --> 01:19:44.420
I'll be damned if you don't look

01:19:44.421 --> 01:19:48.390
more and more like
your father every day.

01:19:48.391 --> 01:19:50.325
As long as I don't act like him.

01:19:50.326 --> 01:19:54.496
He wasn't always such
a hard man, Eli.

01:19:54.497 --> 01:19:56.331
Something bad happened to him,

01:19:56.332 --> 01:19:58.766
and it changed him.

01:20:02.237 --> 01:20:05.908
I won't ever let anything
bad happen to you.

01:20:05.909 --> 01:20:08.276
I promise.

01:22:47.803 --> 01:22:50.706
We love it here, ma'am.
The trailer's real nice.

01:22:50.707 --> 01:22:54.643
Please... call me Ida.

01:22:54.644 --> 01:22:57.112
Ida, this is Billy... my husband.

01:22:57.113 --> 01:23:00.081
And I don't know where
Laura ran off to.

01:24:07.916 --> 01:24:11.520
<i>The last kind words</i>

01:24:11.521 --> 01:24:15.757
<i>I heard my daddy say</i>

01:24:15.758 --> 01:24:19.528
<i>Lord, the last kind words</i>

01:24:19.529 --> 01:24:23.130
<i>I heard my daddy say</i>

01:24:25.701 --> 01:24:29.071
<i>If I die, if I die</i>

01:24:29.072 --> 01:24:33.508
<i>In the German war</i>

01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:37.045
<i>I want you to send my body</i>

01:24:37.046 --> 01:24:40.314
<i>Send it to my mother, lord</i>

01:24:42.784 --> 01:24:46.588
<i>If I get killed, if I get killed</i>

01:24:46.589 --> 01:24:50.759
<i>Please don't bury my soul</i>

01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:54.496
<i>I prefer just leave me out</i>

01:24:54.497 --> 01:24:57.398
<i>Let the buzzards eat me whole</i>

01:25:00.068 --> 01:25:03.572
<i>When you see me comin'</i>

01:25:03.573 --> 01:25:07.809
<i>Look across the rich man's field</i>

01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:11.246
<i>And if I don't bring you flour</i>

01:25:11.247 --> 01:25:14.582
<i>I'll bring you bolted meal</i>

01:25:33.969 --> 01:25:37.739
<i>I went to the depot</i>

01:25:37.740 --> 01:25:41.810
<i>I looked up at the stars</i>

01:25:41.811 --> 01:25:45.247
<i>Cried, some train don't come</i>

01:25:45.248 --> 01:25:48.549
<i>There'll be some walkin 'done</i>

01:25:50.919 --> 01:25:54.656
<i>My mama told me</i>

01:25:54.657 --> 01:25:58.794
<i>Just before she died</i>

01:25:58.795 --> 01:26:02.998
<i>Lord, precious daughter</i>

01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:05.466
<i>Don't you be so wild</i>

01:26:07.836 --> 01:26:11.206
<i>The Mississippi river</i>

01:26:11.207 --> 01:26:15.210
<i>You know, it's deep and wide</i>

01:26:15.211 --> 01:26:18.947
<i>I can stand right here</i>

01:26:18.948 --> 01:26:22.149
<i>See my babe from the other side</i>

01:26:24.653 --> 01:26:27.956
<i>What you do to me, baby</i>

01:26:27.957 --> 01:26:32.060
<i>It never gets out of me</i>

01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:35.297
<i>I may not see you</i>

01:26:35.298 --> 01:26:39.066
<i>After I cross the deep blue sea</i>

01:26:40.305 --> 01:26:46.567
