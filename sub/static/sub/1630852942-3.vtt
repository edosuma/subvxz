WEBVTT

00:06.120 --> 00:08.600
<i>She's just the kind of girl</i> <i>
they would recruit,</i>

00:08.640 --> 00:11.000
<i>disenfranchised, disposable...</i>

00:11.040 --> 00:12.200
<i>How is Villanelle?</i>

00:12.240 --> 00:13.360
<i>She's a Christian now.</i>

00:13.400 --> 00:14.440
I'm a bad person

00:14.480 --> 00:15.520
who's trying to be good.

00:15.560 --> 00:17.200
Is that possible?

00:17.240 --> 00:19.640
- I think reinvention
is a form of avoidance.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.080
Who's at the top?

00:21.120 --> 00:22.400
I'll tell you after dessert.

00:22.440 --> 00:24.240
A rat for a rat.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.560
<i>A little light</i> <i>
intimidation.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:29.240
<i>And now I don't think</i> <i>
anyone could love her.</i>

00:29.280 --> 00:30.520
I think she's the devil.

02:18.160 --> 02:19.280
Here you are.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.760
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

02:32.760 --> 02:33.960
Hi.

02:35.680 --> 02:36.760
Oh.

02:44.760 --> 02:45.840
What the...

02:51.320 --> 02:52.560
Actually, never mind.

02:59.600 --> 03:01.320
Are you going to slap me again?

03:02.720 --> 03:03.720
No.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.200
What's it this time?

03:12.440 --> 03:13.440
I need help.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.960
Oh, why don't you ask Jesus?

03:23.480 --> 03:24.640
Where have you been?

03:27.040 --> 03:28.040
Paris.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.600
Paris.

03:34.120 --> 03:35.440
What happened to your hand?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.240
What happened to your clothes?

04:01.160 --> 04:02.320
Can I stay here?

04:10.480 --> 04:11.480
Eve.

04:12.360 --> 04:13.520
Just for tonight.

04:14.720 --> 04:16.000
Eve, things are bad.

04:16.560 --> 04:17.560
Uh-huh.

04:18.360 --> 04:19.360
Yeah.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.480
Um...

04:23.520 --> 04:24.560
Take whatever you want.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.200
There's money
in the bedside table.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.520
Can you be gone when I get back?

05:09.320 --> 05:10.840
I've barely had a chance
to wash my bits.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.000
Villanelle's in my room.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.600
What? What does she want?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.480
Sanctuary.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.440
I think she's killed again.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.720
What do you want to do?

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
Nothing.

05:23.600 --> 05:24.600
Not my job.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.400
Right.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.280
Uh, whoa!
There's some sensitive
material on there.

05:33.320 --> 05:36.920
Well, is it sensitive if
everyone in a ten-mile
radius has seen it?

05:36.960 --> 05:39.280
Can you... What? Fair.

05:39.320 --> 05:43.200
Oh, can you find where
Helene's car has been?
Here's her reg.

05:43.240 --> 05:45.120
Yeah, easy.
AMPR will flag that.

05:45.160 --> 05:47.640
- Automatic number plate.
- I don't care.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.960
Well, then, just yes.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.360
- Okay. Are you ready
for my theory?
- Born ready.

05:54.920 --> 05:58.080
Helene is as clueless
as we are

05:58.120 --> 06:01.000
about who sits
at the top of The Twelve.

06:01.040 --> 06:05.480
I think she is torturing
each member to get to the next,

06:05.520 --> 06:10.800
one by one
until she works her way up
to the head of the monster.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.560
You know, it's a form
of the contact chain method.
That would make sense.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.160
Yeah. Why didn't we
think of that?

06:15.200 --> 06:17.560
Yeah, I'm... I'm kicking myself.

06:17.600 --> 06:20.000
Torture's actually
one of my strong suits.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.160
- So, she's not that far ahead.
- No.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.160
- Ah!

06:25.200 --> 06:29.400
This number plate was picked up
on a congestion zone
camera 10:30, last night.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.320
Fitzrovia Garage.

06:31.360 --> 06:33.360
So, her London base
must be near Fitzrovia.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.160
Or the driver keeps her car
in Fitzrovia. I mean,
that's rich people for you.

06:39.040 --> 06:40.640
Wanna do a stakeout?

06:40.680 --> 06:43.120
Uh, yes, but one of us
is going to have to
spend the morning

06:43.160 --> 06:46.080
keeping a senior diplomat
from Bahrain alive, so...

06:55.840 --> 06:57.200
Such a rock.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.800
"Such a rock."

07:00.280 --> 07:01.720
Hey. Hey!

07:06.400 --> 07:07.760
Hey!

07:07.800 --> 07:09.080
Paper wins.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.280
What a princess you are.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.560
Look, I've run out
of my brochures.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.520
- Won't be a minute.
I'll be right here.

08:20.560 --> 08:21.960
- Oh, Elliot.
- Get away!

08:22.360 --> 08:24.280
Creep!

08:24.320 --> 08:27.480
I've finished with Mr Turner.
We can do family
viewings tomorrow.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.840
Thank you?

08:30.880 --> 08:34.360
It's not the rat,
and the smell is ever ripening.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.640
For the life of me,
I can't find the source.

08:36.680 --> 08:38.720
You could have
cleaned the place up.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.640
I wouldn't dream of it.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.800
Of course,
you could get me an office.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.840
Instead of having me
pecking around here
like a pigeon in the attic.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.880
You know I can't.

08:50.440 --> 08:53.280
Well, then,
three suspected members
of The Twelve murdered so far,

08:53.320 --> 08:56.600
all of them
by sadistic torture.

08:56.640 --> 08:57.880
I may have found us a fourth.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.520
Who?

08:59.560 --> 09:02.080
Well, "How?" might be a more
pertinent question.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.960
A man was found dead in a farm,
he'd been tied up.

09:05.000 --> 09:08.560
His feet have been
dipped in salt and goats
allowed to lick them raw.

09:09.640 --> 09:11.120
Like fleshy ice creams.

09:11.440 --> 09:12.480
Hmm.

09:14.360 --> 09:17.200
Carolyn, come on.

09:17.240 --> 09:18.600
Well, nobody else claimed it.

09:19.840 --> 09:21.800
It's interesting.

09:21.840 --> 09:23.160
Keep doing it.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.360
Why don't you take the rest
of the afternoon off?

09:30.400 --> 09:33.200
Go sightseeing
or eat some brunch.

09:33.240 --> 09:36.120
I knew a man
who died eating brunch.

09:36.160 --> 09:41.560
He made hand woven silk rugs,
using an ancient technique
from China.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.880
They were just
utterly exquisite things.

09:44.920 --> 09:49.840
But, alas, he choked on a stray
raspberry floating in his

09:49.880 --> 09:51.360
bottomless Bellini.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.800
I'm going to have to
start charging you...

10:08.800 --> 10:10.520
What can I help you with?

10:10.560 --> 10:12.000
Aren't you a therapist?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.000
Yeah, sort of.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.160
Well...

10:19.560 --> 10:21.000
I want therapy.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.840
Um...

10:26.880 --> 10:30.760
Therapy requires a situation
where we both feel safe but...

10:31.840 --> 10:34.520
I don't feel very safe, so...

10:34.560 --> 10:37.600
My suggestion is you leave

10:37.640 --> 10:39.440
- and we make an appointment.
- No.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.240
No.

10:43.360 --> 10:45.760
But I work at Broadmoor.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.400
If I don't turn up
to work today,
alarm bells will be raised.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.080
You're going to call in sick.

10:52.280 --> 10:53.280
Right.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.520
What do you want to talk about?

11:04.760 --> 11:06.320
What do you know about me?

11:08.080 --> 11:10.120
I know that you're an assassin.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.040
A highly skilled one.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.680
Are you flattering me?

11:17.080 --> 11:18.840
- No.
- No.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.040
Just the facts.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.000
What's bothering you,
Villanelle?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.120
I don't like the way I feel.

11:36.680 --> 11:37.840
Which is what?

11:40.040 --> 11:41.080
Hmm.

11:43.800 --> 11:45.240
Like shit.

11:45.280 --> 11:46.400
All of the time.

11:50.280 --> 11:51.840
I want you to fix that.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.320
And Helene...

12:12.160 --> 12:14.080
And Helene,

12:14.120 --> 12:16.880
she didn't just punched
my heart to bits.

12:18.240 --> 12:21.200
- She can read
one bastard letter!
- I'm sorry.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.760
Helene's a player.
I've gotta go pick her up.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.760
Are you honestly
doing this over the phone?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.880
What? Can we just, at least...

12:35.920 --> 12:38.320
Yeah, well, screw you!

12:38.360 --> 12:40.680
- I'm so... I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

12:40.720 --> 12:43.000
- Are you okay?
- Um...

12:43.040 --> 12:44.640
- Oh.
- No.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.160
My girlfriend just dumped me.
Over the phone.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.480
That dog!

12:48.520 --> 12:49.880
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

12:49.920 --> 12:51.600
Women can be cruel.
- Oh!

12:51.640 --> 12:52.840
You're telling me.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.240
Oh. You've been there?

12:54.280 --> 12:55.640
Oh, yeah, <i>chica.</i>

12:56.320 --> 12:57.360
Big time.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.160
You know what?

13:00.200 --> 13:01.320
Forget her.

13:01.360 --> 13:04.080
She's poop on your shoes!

13:04.120 --> 13:08.480
Um, you know,
I know this is, like,
totally pathetic, but...

13:08.520 --> 13:11.920
I have no friends
in this country.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.640
Literally, not one and I...

13:13.680 --> 13:16.160
I really don't want to be
on my own right now.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.920
Can I...

13:18.960 --> 13:22.480
- Can I buy you a cup of coffee
or a glass of wine?
- No.

13:23.040 --> 13:24.040
Oh.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.600
Cos you do have a friend.

13:27.400 --> 13:30.080
Oh!

13:30.120 --> 13:32.400
Thank you.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.640
Are you stupid?

13:45.240 --> 13:49.080
Just a genuine question because

13:49.120 --> 13:52.600
I've said so many times,

13:52.640 --> 13:55.840
you're only allowed
out there when I say so.

13:58.400 --> 14:01.440
You scare off the customers.

14:02.480 --> 14:03.480
Sorry.

14:04.880 --> 14:05.920
Sorry?

14:08.240 --> 14:11.320
You know I don't need to
be here, don't you?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.480
I could've just put you
in foster care,

14:13.520 --> 14:15.600
and then I'd be at uni

14:16.400 --> 14:18.200
having the time of my life.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.480
Yeah, you've mentioned it.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.000
You're a nobody.

14:23.800 --> 14:25.600
It's no wonder Dad hated you.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.040
He wanted Mum
to have an abortion.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.120
He'd be embarrassed to see
how you run his business.

14:39.480 --> 14:41.040
Don't you agree, Mr Turner?

14:47.560 --> 14:48.560
Bye, Pam.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.880
- Here's to being dumped.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.520
And ex-girlfriends from hell.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.600
<i>-Salud.</i> <i>
- Salud.</i>

15:18.240 --> 15:19.880
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.560
- I'm Nicole, by the way.
- Hmm.

15:21.600 --> 15:22.960
Oh, I'm Fernanda.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.680
Nicole, women are so much
worse than men.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.560
- No one told you.
- You didn't get the memo?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.880
I... No.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.240
This was actually my first time
with a woman, so...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.480
- Really?
- Hmm.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.840
Mmm. She must've been
really special.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.520
Hotter than potatoes.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.280
Sexy, mysterious.

15:46.680 --> 15:47.960
And French.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.040
We'll have a bottle.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.480
Thank you.

16:07.080 --> 16:08.640
Like toxic waste.

16:09.680 --> 16:10.880
So British.

16:14.360 --> 16:15.520
It's melting.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.200
So, what do you need, Pam?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.320
Um, yeah. So...

16:23.080 --> 16:25.520
I was just wondering
if you think I'm ready.

16:25.560 --> 16:26.880
Whether I could start work soon.

16:27.600 --> 16:28.600
No.

16:29.320 --> 16:30.480
Not just yet.

16:31.640 --> 16:34.160
- Right. Yeah. Cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.480
I'll do whatever it takes.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.400
- I mean, I can put
extra hours in...
- Pam.

16:39.440 --> 16:41.560
Is there anything
you'd like to tell me?

16:43.720 --> 16:45.440
I don't know. I don't think so.

16:45.480 --> 16:47.480
Well, there's
a former employee of MI5

16:47.520 --> 16:51.240
who came to your funeral home
and you didn't tell me.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.520
That woman, then in turn,
tracked down my home in Paris,

16:54.560 --> 16:55.840
where my daughter lives.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.520
MI5?

16:58.880 --> 16:59.960
It's fine.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.960
What's the rush?
What's so pressing?

17:07.000 --> 17:08.280
I just...

17:13.000 --> 17:15.840
Things are difficult
at home.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.960
Yeah. I get that.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
Must be hard.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.360
You know,

17:26.400 --> 17:30.040
I was drawn to you
the moment I first met you.

17:30.080 --> 17:33.960
This little ghost of a girl
hiding in the shadows.

17:34.000 --> 17:38.240
People don't
notice you, and if they do,

17:38.280 --> 17:39.640
they underestimate you.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.080
And there lies your power.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.560
You're going to be
extraordinary, Pam.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.200
But you're not ready yet.

17:53.360 --> 17:55.320
Trust me. I'll tell you
when you are, okay?

17:58.200 --> 18:00.720
We connected here,
you know, Nicole?

18:00.760 --> 18:03.040
Before we connected here.

18:03.080 --> 18:06.040
It was fire,
it was danger.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.360
She changed me.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.280
Aw.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.760
The woman on the phone,
what's she like?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.240
Controlling.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
Selfish.

18:33.800 --> 18:35.000
Delusional.

18:39.120 --> 18:40.760
You gotta cut her out, Nicole.

18:40.800 --> 18:44.440
She only gets to play games
if you agree to play them.

18:57.240 --> 19:00.880
You said that you felt like poo.
Is that common for you?

19:01.240 --> 19:02.240
No.

19:03.040 --> 19:04.080
So, why now?

19:04.920 --> 19:07.040
I don't know.

19:07.080 --> 19:10.680
I killed two people
last night after I tried
really hard not to.

19:13.840 --> 19:18.240
Okay, well, that's not ideal,
but presumably common for you.

19:19.280 --> 19:20.680
So, why has this shaken you?

19:20.720 --> 19:22.280
Martin, I'm a rainbow

19:22.320 --> 19:24.680
in a world full of
beige people like you.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.520
- No offense.
- No.

19:29.840 --> 19:31.960
I usually know what I want

19:32.000 --> 19:35.320
and who I want
and how I want it.
And now, I don't. I...

19:39.040 --> 19:41.040
I don't even trust
my own thoughts right now.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.080
Yeah.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.640
Can you say more about that?

19:45.880 --> 19:47.920
Is this what being
insecure feels like?

19:47.960 --> 19:49.120
Okay.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.680
Let me put it this way.

19:51.720 --> 19:54.800
Change isn't always comfortable.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.960
Feeling like poo,
it might be a good thing.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.000
A sign that you're already
mid metamorphosis.

20:42.760 --> 20:44.800
Are you afraid
of dead bodies?

20:44.840 --> 20:46.280
What the hell are you doing?

20:48.000 --> 20:49.120
Are you?

20:50.440 --> 20:51.440
No.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.000
Elliot.

20:53.800 --> 20:55.480
Apologise.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.560
- You are, aren't you?
- Apologise.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
Boo!

21:03.160 --> 21:05.440
Apologise!

21:05.480 --> 21:06.640
You think I'm joking?

21:06.680 --> 21:08.200
No, please don't.
Elliot, please.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.800
Please don't. Okay. I'm sorry.

21:17.880 --> 21:19.080
I'm gonna kill you.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.440
You're not
a very nice boy, Elliot.

21:53.840 --> 21:59.000
It was so cruel because she knew
that my husband had just left.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.680
Oh, you were married?

22:00.720 --> 22:01.880
Five years.

22:01.920 --> 22:04.160
- Oh.
- He was rich.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.880
- Big box rich.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.640
- What did he do?
Was he like, in finance?
- Oh, you know what?

22:10.360 --> 22:12.080
I have no idea.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.840
- I was never allowed to ask.
- Oh.

22:13.880 --> 22:15.600
- But I found out why.
- Why?

22:15.640 --> 22:18.440
I find these letters
from this woman.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.240
He's clearly been
shacking up with her

22:20.280 --> 22:22.560
- every time he's out of town.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.600
So, you know what?
I confronted him.

22:24.640 --> 22:25.880
And he walked out.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.600
Never came back.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.240
So, you haven't
talked to him since

22:30.280 --> 22:32.320
- and you don't know where he is?
- Mmm-hmm.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.320
Well, where could he be?

22:35.360 --> 22:38.440
I don't know.
and that's why I'm here.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.480
I have nothing left in Cuba.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.200
God.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.520
- And then you met Helene.
- Ah!

22:48.600 --> 22:50.520
Then poof does vanish.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.200
She's done the same as him.

22:52.680 --> 22:54.200
Mmm, mmm...

22:55.080 --> 22:56.680
I think this is out of date.

22:56.720 --> 22:58.440
Oh, you know,
we should get you some water...

22:58.480 --> 23:02.160
That ex-husband
sounds like a real asshole.
What was his name?

23:06.600 --> 23:08.200
I need the bathroom. Sorry.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.080
Oh, um...

23:10.760 --> 23:12.920
Okay, uh...

23:12.960 --> 23:14.520
Let me know
if you need anything.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.280
Nicole?

24:36.840 --> 24:38.200
- Well?
Hmm.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.440
Sorry. It's all I've got in.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.560
It's uh, lunchables.

24:57.280 --> 24:58.360
You have kids?

24:58.400 --> 24:59.400
No.

25:02.360 --> 25:03.560
Aren't you going to eat?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.120
My um...
My IBS is playing up.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.720
- Yeah, feeling a bit cramp...
- Hmm.

25:09.800 --> 25:10.800
Crampy.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.040
Okay.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.640
Do you think
I was born like this?

25:25.360 --> 25:26.880
What do you mean? A psychopath?

25:30.600 --> 25:32.000
Do you think
you're born like this?

25:34.360 --> 25:37.360
Being a therapist
is easy. Hmm?

25:37.400 --> 25:39.400
I ask something and you just

25:39.440 --> 25:42.000
repeat it back
with a question mark
on the end.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.080
Hmm.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.160
The point is,
I don't know you.

25:47.200 --> 25:50.200
Because how you feel
is more important
than what I think.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.440
And no, I don't believe

25:52.480 --> 25:55.200
you have to be born
with psychopathy
to behave like one.

25:55.240 --> 25:57.240
I mean, look at mercenaries.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.680
They're trained into it.

26:01.480 --> 26:03.160
Would you rather you weren't?

26:05.080 --> 26:06.400
A psychopath?

26:10.880 --> 26:12.720
Do you know how many psychopaths
have stepped in front of me

26:12.760 --> 26:14.720
and said they don't want
to be a psychopath?

26:16.560 --> 26:17.600
Zero.

26:19.000 --> 26:22.080
Psychopaths feel superior.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.120
Like a god.

26:25.600 --> 26:29.440
And gods don't often think
they need to change, so, uh...

26:30.080 --> 26:31.480
I'd say that's hopeful.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.600
You've done
a lot of good work.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.000
Okay. That's a good place
to end for today.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.280
Did you just say that stuff
to try and get rid of me?

26:50.200 --> 26:51.200
Did you?

26:52.040 --> 26:53.040
No.

26:56.040 --> 26:57.480
Don't make fun of me.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.640
Are you okay?

27:24.320 --> 27:25.520
What's happened?

27:27.080 --> 27:28.440
I murdered my brother.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.840
Excuse me?

27:30.880 --> 27:33.840
Stabbed him 19 times and then
embalmed his body.

27:36.880 --> 27:38.360
- Did you clean up?
- Yeah.

27:39.600 --> 27:41.760
- Where's the body now?
- It's in the morgue.

27:46.040 --> 27:47.640
I told you, you weren't ready.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.880
Did you think that was open
for interpretation?

27:51.920 --> 27:56.440
- No, it's just you said
people underestimate me so...
- Yeah, I'm still talking.

27:56.480 --> 27:59.840
Disobey me again
and you will learn how
easily dispensable you are.

28:01.240 --> 28:02.360
Are you following me?

28:03.360 --> 28:04.960
- I...
- Are you following me?

28:06.680 --> 28:08.760
Good. Now go.
I need to handle this. Go.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.280
- What?
<i>He survived.</i>

28:18.320 --> 28:20.000
<i>The FSB have got him.</i>

28:22.280 --> 28:23.360
<i>Merde!</i>

29:00.440 --> 29:01.640
Morning, Claudia.

29:05.960 --> 29:07.360
How is the English coming?

29:09.240 --> 29:10.240
Tremendous.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.960
Good.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.080
is that for me?

29:15.720 --> 29:18.600
I made my own sausages.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.640
Chubby bangers!

29:29.680 --> 29:33.160
- Oh, you're spoiling me!

29:33.200 --> 29:35.400
Special treat for Mr Big Boss.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.600
- Uh, I'll get...

29:38.640 --> 29:41.600
No, no, no, it's one of mine.

29:41.640 --> 29:42.880
- Thank you, Claudia.

29:44.720 --> 29:45.720
Okay.

29:57.640 --> 29:58.680
Yes?

30:42.160 --> 30:43.400
What, peat moss?

30:45.560 --> 30:47.280
Marvellous.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.400
Hang on. Say that again.

30:51.440 --> 30:54.440
So Helene's ex-girlfriend's
ex-husband is who?

30:55.720 --> 30:58.240
- I don't know...

30:58.280 --> 31:00.200
...but he is someone.

31:00.240 --> 31:04.680
I think that's who
Helene is trying to get to
because Fernanda isn't her type.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.080
How do you know
what her type is?

31:06.120 --> 31:07.160
Oh.

31:08.640 --> 31:10.360
I know what she likes.

31:10.400 --> 31:13.800
I think
you're being sexist.

31:13.840 --> 31:15.640
Maybe Fernanda's the one
in The Twelve.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.560
No. Number one,

31:18.600 --> 31:22.240
if she was, Helene would have
yanked her fingernails
out by now.

31:22.280 --> 31:23.600
And number two...

31:24.280 --> 31:25.280
Oh.

31:26.600 --> 31:29.200
- All right. Yeah.
Not very Twelve.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:30.320 --> 31:31.400
Oh, is that it?

31:41.520 --> 31:42.760
You need to be much faster.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.800
Er...

31:47.600 --> 31:48.800
Marriage certificate.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.120
- Mmm-hmm.

31:53.400 --> 31:58.040
Hello, Lars Meier.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.080
May-er.

31:59.840 --> 32:00.960
Lars May-er.

32:06.160 --> 32:09.800
I have never seen your toes
nude in public before.

32:10.560 --> 32:11.840
It's very unsettling.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.720
It seems our assassin
is in Scotland.

32:18.760 --> 32:21.280
- I'll fly there tomorrow.
- Well, there's been
another attack.

32:22.120 --> 32:23.520
A Russian agent in Cuba.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.640
Guztam Zimmel.

32:26.320 --> 32:27.800
He survived.

32:27.840 --> 32:31.320
- Well, then he must be
a member of The Twelve.
- Indeed.

32:31.360 --> 32:33.880
- Which means he's been
under your nose all along.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.360
He was sadistically tortured
and left for dead.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.200
His toes were severed

32:39.240 --> 32:42.240
and inserted into his nostrils.

32:42.280 --> 32:45.240
Well, a live victim
might be more loquacious
than an assassin.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.840
Yeah. I've had him moved
into a safe house
to be taken care of.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.520
He won't survive
the flight as yet.

32:51.560 --> 32:54.120
Well, forget Scotland.
Leave him to me.
I'll fly to Cuba.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.440
Are you sure?

32:55.480 --> 32:57.000
It might get ugly.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.320
Vlad, I am more
than ready to get
my hands dirty.

33:01.680 --> 33:04.000
Now, let me have some
of your delicious food.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.040
Thank you.

33:58.160 --> 33:59.240
Enough.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.320
Well...

34:07.360 --> 34:09.960
There's an elephant in the room
that we haven't addressed yet.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.280
What about her?

34:13.320 --> 34:16.960
Well, you want to change,
and you want to stop killing.

34:17.000 --> 34:20.160
You've had plenty of opportunity
to kill Eve over the years,
and you never have.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.160
Well, I tried.

34:22.200 --> 34:24.200
If you wanted her dead,
she'd be dead,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.520
so what sets her apart?

34:28.440 --> 34:31.320
Do you enjoy the power
you have over her?

34:34.760 --> 34:35.840
Yes.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.840
In healthy relationships

34:41.880 --> 34:44.800
you have to make
yourself vulnerable too.

34:44.840 --> 34:47.760
Allow someone else to have
that sort of power over you.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.120
Well, Eve does.

34:51.160 --> 34:53.520
- Does she?
- Yes, she's ruined everything.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.080
So, why don't you move on then?

34:56.120 --> 34:57.640
Because that would
ruin everything.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.280
So, what do you want from her?

35:02.560 --> 35:04.160
I want to smell her skin.

35:09.840 --> 35:13.440
I want to hear the boring stuff
she does every day

35:13.480 --> 35:17.760
that she wouldn't bother
telling anyone else because
it's really that boring.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.640
But to me, it would be
fascinating because...

35:23.640 --> 35:25.080
It's Eve.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.320
Ah, because in our bones
we understand each other.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.560
Eve's not beige then?

35:37.360 --> 35:39.640
She's a rainbow in beige boots.

35:47.760 --> 35:49.480
Villanelle.

35:49.520 --> 35:51.120
Open the door.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.960
Hi.

35:57.000 --> 35:58.880
- How can I help you?
- Let me in.

36:01.880 --> 36:03.160
Villanelle!

36:04.400 --> 36:07.040
- No, he hasn't eaten all day...

36:12.360 --> 36:13.480
It was an accident.

36:13.520 --> 36:14.880
Can you just let me in?

36:18.280 --> 36:19.960
Martin?

36:20.000 --> 36:21.400
Oh, God.

36:22.760 --> 36:24.080
Martin?

36:24.120 --> 36:25.560
Martin, can you hear me?

36:26.280 --> 36:27.480
Relax.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.120
Concussion at worst.

36:30.160 --> 36:31.720
What are you even doing here?

36:34.320 --> 36:35.360
Therapy.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.480
You know,
you can just book a therapist.

36:38.520 --> 36:40.360
You don't have to
take one hostage.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.320
Oh.

36:43.360 --> 36:46.160
But then you wouldn't be able
to get my attention. Right.

36:46.200 --> 36:47.200
Give me that.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.360
You didn't have to come.

36:53.880 --> 36:55.160
I came for Martin.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.840
So, did you have
any breakthroughs?

37:23.320 --> 37:24.360
Maybe.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.120
Mmm.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.800
They trained me
to be like this,

37:34.440 --> 37:36.320
so maybe I can be
trained out of it.

37:45.120 --> 37:48.160
Do you know that fable about
the scorpion and the frog?

37:49.440 --> 37:50.840
- They hook up?
- No.

37:51.840 --> 37:53.240
They both die.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.040
Because the scorpion
can't change its nature.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.400
Maybe you are the scorpion.

38:42.680 --> 38:44.800
I should have done this
when we first met.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.320
Done what?

39:52.440 --> 39:54.680
She's young, she's green,
but she has potential.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.360
I need her
ready to work quickly.

39:56.400 --> 39:57.800
Why the rush?

39:57.840 --> 39:59.120
Well, you know,
the usual antics.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.440
Why not use a local candidate?

40:01.480 --> 40:03.880
Because you're
easier to blackmail.

40:03.920 --> 40:07.440
No,
because you're the best.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.840
And anyway, isn't it nice
to help a disenfranchised
young woman

40:10.880 --> 40:12.480
fulfil her potential?

40:17.640 --> 40:18.680
Chop chop.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.080
<i>Well, hello.</i>

41:03.120 --> 41:04.560
I rose to your challenge.

41:04.600 --> 41:06.400
<i>You found out who's at the top?</i>

41:06.440 --> 41:08.520
<i>-What's the name?</i>
- Oh, hang on.

41:10.480 --> 41:12.400
I think you owe me dessert.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.000
<i>That's right, I do.</i>

41:14.040 --> 41:16.640
<i>When are you free?</i>

41:17.480 --> 41:18.600
Now.

41:43.480 --> 41:47.200
<i>Your brain it's</i> <i>
like a hamster on a wheel.</i>

41:47.240 --> 41:50.000
<i>So,</i> <i>
tell me about yourself.</i> <i>
What are you good at?</i>

41:50.040 --> 41:51.960
- Embalming.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.480
<i>Look what</i> <i>
the cat dragged in.</i>

41:55.520 --> 41:56.560
I thought you were dead.

41:56.920 --> 41:58.200
Whoo!

41:58.240 --> 41:59.920
Don't underestimate me.

41:59.960 --> 42:02.240
<i>No one leaves</i> <i>
The Twelve.</i>

42:02.280 --> 42:04.640
I've been tracking attacks
on members of The Twelve.

42:06.000 --> 42:07.520
Look. Is that him?

42:07.560 --> 42:08.600
<i>That's gotta be him.</i>

42:10.480 --> 42:12.200
I want my phone call!
