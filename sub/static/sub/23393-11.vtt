Come on, girls.
We're going to be late for lunch.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.894
-I'll grab our table.
-Okay.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.983
How the hell did we get here?

01:08.151 --> 01:10.570
I think it all started with that tub.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.783
- My tub!
- Oh, my God!

01:15.492 --> 01:17.410
What the hell happened?

01:17.911 --> 01:19.079
Is it a portal?

01:19.162 --> 01:21.998
Oh, take my hand, Grace. We jump together!

01:22.082 --> 01:25.293
It--
It must have been the ceiling leak.

01:25.710 --> 01:29.130
What the hell is this?

01:29.214 --> 01:32.842
A left-hand twist, big galaxy blast
tie-dye design. Why?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.969
I thought we decided
not to use that bathroom

01:35.053 --> 01:36.554
and you were tie-dyeing in it?

01:36.638 --> 01:38.848
Grace, we don't know what happened.
We weren't there.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.642
I think we do know what happened.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.770
You filled the tub with heavy,
wet garbage!

01:44.395 --> 01:48.024
Oh, look at us, fighting.
It's not very "Harriet" of us.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.193
It would be
if I killed you with a vibrator.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.862
Come on,
we can take care of this together.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.447
But you get the ball rolling.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.032
And then keep it rolling.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.576
And then roll that baby till it's done.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
So, just our usual arrangement?

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
If you insist.

02:01.746 --> 02:03.665
We need a contractor, ASAP.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.544
On the bright side, we've got
some deep hues on this bad Larry!

02:14.676 --> 02:16.136
That therapist...

02:16.636 --> 02:17.720
certainly...

02:18.555 --> 02:19.889
said some things.

02:19.973 --> 02:20.974
Yes.

02:22.433 --> 02:23.768
Interesting.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.687
So you felt...

02:26.229 --> 02:27.355
I felt...

02:28.148 --> 02:31.276
that she... was insane!

02:31.359 --> 02:33.236
Oh, my God. Me, too!

02:33.862 --> 02:36.698
But I'm new to all of this
and I have nothing to compare it to.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.742
Telling us to take time apart?

02:40.201 --> 02:42.412
-Come on, lady.
-Right.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.415
And what kind of a suggestion is
an open relationship?

02:45.498 --> 02:48.001
A terrible one! Lady!

02:48.084 --> 02:51.588
Well, it's nice to be agreeing
on something for once.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.423
I agree.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.677
And that crazy business about Roy.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.514
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
he invited me out.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.851
It's all right, really.
You're allowed to have friends.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.729
It is nice to "folk out" with "folk" folk.

03:07.812 --> 03:10.315
Then you should see him when he's here.

03:10.398 --> 03:12.025
In fact, I'd like to meet him.

03:12.108 --> 03:14.193
-Really? Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.613
Invite him over.
We'll all have lunch together.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.615
I'll get a nice deli platter.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.950
That sounds like an excuse
for you to have some deli.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.954
Well, if you can see Roy,
I can eat some deli.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.080
Ha.

03:26.164 --> 03:27.123
Okay.

04:05.954 --> 04:06.871
What the...

04:06.955 --> 04:09.249
No, no, no, no to all of this.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.876
Oh, Grace, I know you said
that you wanted to take the lead

04:11.960 --> 04:13.169
in this contractor thing--

04:13.253 --> 04:14.963
No, you told me to take the lead.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.966
Regardless of what you said,
I found the perfect guy for the job.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.010
-This is Stamford.
-Oh!

04:21.094 --> 04:22.971
-How do you do?
-I do not.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.222
Thank you.

04:25.723 --> 04:27.100
Where did you find this guy?

04:27.183 --> 04:31.062
You know that lovely renovated home
down the street you always talk about?

04:31.145 --> 04:32.605
Yeah, I do.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.233
Well, Stamford used to live
in the woods out back.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.736
Look, I can fix this
and put it back the way it was,

04:39.279 --> 04:42.782
but we do have some options here.

04:42.865 --> 04:43.700
Oh, I'm listening.

04:43.783 --> 04:47.370
I was thinking we put in
a glass-bottom bathroom,

04:47.453 --> 04:49.831
so you can always see
what's a-brewin' down in the kitchen.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.124
-No!
-Interesting.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.627
Or we make it
one of those two-story showerheads

04:54.711 --> 04:56.337
the fancies are doing these days.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.297
-No.
-Totally.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.550
Or maybe even leave the tub--

05:00.633 --> 05:02.010
Oh, sorry.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.220
Go for Stamford.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.972
Oh, sorry.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.390
Go for Stamford.

05:08.182 --> 05:11.144
No, Stamford is my first name.

05:11.811 --> 05:13.021
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.273
Oh, Jesus Christ.

05:15.356 --> 05:18.693
Look, Frankie, I appreciate
you're trying to help with this,

05:18.776 --> 05:22.488
but we need to find somebody that we trust
to do the job right.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.951
Grace, if you can look into the eye
of the eagle painted on Stam's van

05:27.035 --> 05:29.412
and not trust him, you're not human.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.832
I have a list of real contractors
who wear shoes...

05:33.666 --> 05:36.127
who are going to come over
and assess the damage.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.211
That's how we do this.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.132
We interview a number of people,
and then we choose the best.

05:41.215 --> 05:45.428
Look, we'll use your guy
when we need some magic beans.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.688
What if we cut back
on our cleaning service?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.608
-We need major cuts.
-What if we make a bunch of small cuts?

05:58.691 --> 06:01.861
Like cheaper pens?
Ew. No, I hate cheap pens.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.615
Excuse me, someone took my standing desk.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.075
We're making some cuts, Josh.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.826
Yeah, but I brought that in myself.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.078
Gotta get on board, Josh.

06:13.081 --> 06:15.208
How much would we save if we fired him?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.168
Not enough.

06:17.251 --> 06:19.170
Okay, then find something else, Barry.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.214
Work the numbers.
Crunchy crunchy, typie typie.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.800
I'm trying.
Unless you want to sell to Lauren--

06:23.883 --> 06:27.011
I will sell to Lauren
over Mallory's dead body.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.846
Stop saying that.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.556
I don't see any other options.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.142
-Unless--
-We're not doing that.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.770
-Wait, what aren't we doing?
-We're not going to--

06:35.853 --> 06:38.606
We're not firing you, Mallory.
Barry wants to fire you.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.149
But you're not paying me.

06:40.233 --> 06:43.569
I know and that's why we're not doing it,
Barry. It's a bad idea.

06:44.112 --> 06:46.864
Okay, fine. You know where I stand.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.867
-I'm not talking about it.
-Maybe I want to talk about it.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.328
You know what? Barry's right.
Mallory, you're fired.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.001
Yeah. Nice shirt, Frankie.

07:02.755 --> 07:03.756
Go for your momma.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.716
Hello, Mother. Uh...

07:05.800 --> 07:08.678
Do babies change? Like, in week two?

07:08.803 --> 07:11.347
Not themselves.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.435
-So what's up?
-Faith's got this new thing where

07:15.518 --> 07:18.229
she only falls asleep
if I drive her around in a car.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.314
I'm this close to putting her in an Uber.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.691
You want me to come over?

07:21.774 --> 07:25.695
Well, I'll survive today actually,
but, you know, tomorrow,

07:25.778 --> 07:27.738
if you wanna drive around
the neighborhood

07:27.822 --> 07:30.575
for an hour in the afternoon,
that would be amazing.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.703
Oh, gosh, Bud, I don't know.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.914
You're only making
my flippin' dreams come true!

07:36.998 --> 07:37.999
Thanks, Mom.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.417
Faith, did you hear that?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.377
I'm coming to see you tomorrow!

07:41.461 --> 07:44.005
I love you! I love you! We're in love!

07:45.756 --> 07:46.757
Bye, Bud.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.010
Mom, I think that she... Mom?

07:49.427 --> 07:50.344
Mom?

07:56.184 --> 08:00.229
So my first suggestion would be
to put the tub back in the bathroom.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.609
We had a guy out here
who suggested a two-story shower.

08:04.692 --> 08:07.445
Hmm. There are a lot
of bad contractors out there.

08:07.528 --> 08:09.739
Yeah. My roommate
wants to hire all of them.

08:09.822 --> 08:12.909
The good news is the damage
is pretty much contained to...

08:14.494 --> 08:15.369
all of this.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.746
What a relief.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.374
And I do have a window right now
before I start a bigger job.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.710
Oh, I need to get a few more bids first.

08:22.835 --> 08:25.505
Of course. Of course.
Just make sure whoever you get

08:25.588 --> 08:28.591
can match these finishings,
because the work in here is impeccable.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.092
I had an amazing contractor.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.302
Why aren't you using him?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.888
Unfortunately, he passed away.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.932
-What was his name?
-Phil Milstein.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.808
Oh, my God. You're kidding me.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.269
You-- You knew him?

08:40.352 --> 08:42.730
Yeah. Great guy.

08:43.105 --> 08:46.150
Phil gave me the five grand I needed
to start my company.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.444
That sounds like him.

08:49.445 --> 08:51.364
Well, I'll leave you
to your other appointments.

08:51.822 --> 08:55.076
-Thank you.
-No, thank you for telling me about Phil.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.120
I feel bad we lost touch.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.501
-Hank?
-Yeah.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.586
How soon do you think
you'd be able to start?

09:05.670 --> 09:07.713
I could have a crew here
first thing tomorrow.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.806
And then, Roy swigged the last of the wine

09:16.889 --> 09:20.560
and began playing the bottle like a jug!

09:20.643 --> 09:24.188
Now, he'd already turned those two plates
into cymbals,

09:24.272 --> 09:27.191
so he had to hold the jug
between his knees.

09:27.275 --> 09:29.777
Oh, wow, this story's forever.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.445
All right, mister.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.072
How about this?

09:33.155 --> 09:36.284
Roy is bringing something very,
very special.

09:36.367 --> 09:40.204
Four hours of rare Woody Guthrie
bootleg tapes!

09:40.288 --> 09:42.331
Boy, when you said, "Four hours,"

09:42.415 --> 09:45.585
I was hoping it would be followed
by "Woody Guthrie bootleg tapes."

09:45.668 --> 09:48.337
Oh! I've gotta find my tape recorder.

09:53.217 --> 09:56.304
-Hey, Peter.
-Robert, this is an emergency.

09:56.387 --> 09:58.723
I had an absolute nightmare last night

09:58.806 --> 10:00.975
that you forgot all the lines
to "Trouble."

10:01.058 --> 10:03.394
That's the actor's nightmare, Peter.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.188
-I'm the actor.
-I even have to do that for you!

10:06.272 --> 10:10.526
We open next week, and you have never
once gotten the words to "Trouble" right.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.278
Get over here right now.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.531
We are going to run it
until you're a well-oiled marine.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.074
I think it's "machine."

10:17.199 --> 10:19.368
It's marine. Be gayer!

10:19.452 --> 10:22.538
Look, Peter, I appreciate your panic.
It's very inspiring.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.167
But I have been practicing,
and I'm not sure I can get away right now.

10:26.250 --> 10:30.671
Roy just texted.
It's not four hours of bootlegs, it's six!

10:32.673 --> 10:34.258
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.388
Oh. I'm sorry about all that.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.183
Where do you want me to move
these thermoses?

10:42.266 --> 10:43.643
Well, actually they're...

10:44.477 --> 10:46.479
Never mind. Put them over there, please.

10:46.562 --> 10:50.316
Do any of these men
actually live in a van?

10:50.399 --> 10:51.984
It certainly doesn't look like it.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.987
Don't you have a playdate
with your granddaughter to get to?

10:55.071 --> 10:58.449
Want to come with? We can take Faith out
and pretend we're a couple

10:58.532 --> 11:01.744
and then make everyone guess
which one of us carried our baby.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.372
Your yelling out, "Whose baby is this?"
to passersby

11:04.455 --> 11:07.833
is not the laugh-riot you think it is.
Anyway, I've got things I have to do.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.753
If you want to take off,
I can call you if anything comes up.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.962
You sure?

11:12.046 --> 11:14.090
No reason for you to be breathing in
all this dust.

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
Square.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.927
Well, here's your deposit.

11:18.469 --> 11:19.470
You promise to call?

11:19.553 --> 11:20.513
-Yep.
-Okay.

11:20.596 --> 11:25.059
Oh, don't hesitate to call me, too.
But not before noon and not after one.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.020
You sure you can't stay?

11:28.104 --> 11:30.189
Trust me,
the last time Peter had a nightmare,

11:30.272 --> 11:32.525
he almost dug up his mother
for her earrings.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.902
-What is his life?
-I'm not sure.

11:34.985 --> 11:35.986
Look, I'll just say hi,

11:36.070 --> 11:38.989
then you and your little folk friend
can get caught up.

11:40.324 --> 11:42.410
- Roy!
- Sol!

11:42.493 --> 11:45.287
Ooh! Ooh!

11:47.081 --> 11:47.915
Oh.

11:47.998 --> 11:51.168
Roy, Robert. Robert, Roy.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.254
I'm sorry, gotta do this.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.550
The hug boat's coming in.
Mwah!

11:58.217 --> 12:01.220
Ooh. You are exactly the height
I thought you'd be.

12:02.054 --> 12:04.098
You are... You are not.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.517
Unfortunately,
Robert's just on his way out.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.852
I have some time.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.061
Oh.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.397
Here, let me grab that.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.065
Come on.

12:14.316 --> 12:17.486
Come on in here.
We've got some lunch and Brie.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.286
Oh, Faith, my girl,

12:25.369 --> 12:29.331
all those big-world concerns,
just let them go.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.056

Tootling about ♪

12:46.140 --> 12:47.850

13:01.780 --> 13:04.283
But this guy didn't care.
He marched up to Judy Collins.

13:04.366 --> 13:06.785
He said, "Judy Collins,
I have loved you since high school.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.037
May I please have this dance?"

13:08.120 --> 13:11.790
Judy Collins looked him right in the eye
and said, "Sir, I'm Michelle Phillips."

13:13.876 --> 13:17.630
She pretended to be upset,
but I know she thought it was funny.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.258
Robert, are you just laughing all day
with this one?

13:21.634 --> 13:23.052
Oh, we laugh a lot.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.763
Oh!

13:25.846 --> 13:28.057
I should grab this, it's my guru.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.266
Hey, Mom!

13:30.392 --> 13:31.852
She was on the cruise, too.

13:31.936 --> 13:33.812
She's incredible.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.942
Well, I guess that's just one more thing
you didn't tell me about Roy.

13:38.025 --> 13:39.360
What else didn't I tell you?

13:39.443 --> 13:41.987
-You didn't tell me he looked like that.
-Like what?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.406
Like Rock Hudson.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.869
A very limber Rock Hudson.

13:48.953 --> 13:50.871
All bodies are beautiful, Robert.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.874
Oh, please.
Next to him, I'm a potato with eyes.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.294
Eyes that can clearly see
what's going on here.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.504
See what?

14:02.258 --> 14:04.593
Why you kept those texts from me.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.680
You were flattered that a man like that
was interested in you.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.724
-For the last time, he's just a friend.
-Does he know that?

14:10.808 --> 14:14.228
He's like a human octopus
with those hands trying to open a conch.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.356
He's demonstrative, yes.
But then, so am I.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.483
All we're doing is having lunch.

14:19.567 --> 14:22.945
Well, yeah, because I'm still here
screwing up the vibe. But once I leave--

14:23.028 --> 14:25.239
I don't want to fight
about this anymore, Robert.

14:25.322 --> 14:28.325
If you want Roy to go,
just tell me and I'll send him away.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.454
I'm not saying you should send him away.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.873
So then what are you saying?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.708
I don't know what I'm saying.

14:35.791 --> 14:40.880
We are going to eat deli and listen
to some Woody Guthrie bootlegs,

14:41.297 --> 14:42.882
because you and I agreed

14:42.965 --> 14:47.428
that we didn't want to be the kind of guys
who would do anything else.

14:49.430 --> 14:50.306
Okay.

14:51.056 --> 14:51.891
Thank you.

14:52.725 --> 14:53.559
Mom says "hi."

14:53.642 --> 14:56.312
She's a little mad I didn't tell her
I was taking the tapes.

14:56.395 --> 14:57.771
"Tapes." That's my cue.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.356
I'll let you get to it.

14:59.857 --> 15:00.941
Have fun, you two.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.151
You're not staying for lunch?

15:02.693 --> 15:04.153
River City calls.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.451
Now that it's just us girls,
give me the dirt on Bud.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.202
He's great, right?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.872
I knew it. He's great.

15:15.539 --> 15:17.583
Where are we?

15:17.666 --> 15:20.336
Faith, does this look like
your neighborhood?

15:21.462 --> 15:23.047
Central Street?

15:23.547 --> 15:26.425
Try harder to be boring, San Diego.

15:26.508 --> 15:29.178
More like Bland-Diego, right, Faith?

15:29.261 --> 15:31.472
Slap me some Hand-Diego.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.893
I could go all day.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.354
Where are we?

15:49.448 --> 15:50.950
Oh, darn it.

16:28.112 --> 16:29.154
You are.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.032
To what do I owe
this unannounced pleasure?

16:32.116 --> 16:36.120
Um, well, we're having a little work done
on the beach house,

16:36.203 --> 16:39.206
which leaves Vybrant
a little homeless for the moment.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.375
Timing, right?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.211
I'm sure you've heard about
the "I am Harriet" movement.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.255
Sure. It's the hot goss.

16:46.338 --> 16:50.134
We need to rent some office space,
you know, until the house is done.

16:50.217 --> 16:53.053
Could I use some
of those extra marketing offices?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.722
We got rid of those.

16:54.805 --> 16:55.723
Oh.

16:56.306 --> 16:57.433
Okay.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.601
I could always camp out in the copy room.

-That's now our marketing office.
-Why'd you do that?

17:02.730 --> 17:04.565
-Who's on first?
-What?

17:04.647 --> 17:06.567
-No. What's on second?
-What's wrong with you?

17:06.650 --> 17:08.777
I'm sorry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.194

17:10.612 --> 17:12.948
Okay... here it is.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.163
I can't tell you.

17:20.705 --> 17:21.915
You're pregnant?

17:22.290 --> 17:24.960
-Ew. No.
-Well, then, what is it?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.296
I will not leave here until you tell me.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.214
Oh, God. Okay.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.594
Not only do I not have space for you,

17:33.677 --> 17:36.388
but I may not have space for me
pretty soon.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.143
Say Grace is in trouble.

17:44.188 --> 17:47.191
We are finally back on track.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.112

Robert...

18:43.413 --> 18:46.834
you should know that when my father
was dying from cancer,

18:46.917 --> 18:48.585
I was there holding his hand

18:48.669 --> 18:51.046
as he struggled to breathe
his last breath.

18:51.672 --> 18:52.840
Why am I telling you this?

18:52.923 --> 18:56.176
So that when I tell you
that your performance of "Trouble" today

18:56.301 --> 18:58.846
is the most difficult thing
I have ever witnessed,

18:58.929 --> 19:01.807
you have some perspective
on what that means.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.100
Is any of that true?

19:03.183 --> 19:04.309
Who cares?

19:04.852 --> 19:06.979
You know fewer lines than yesterday.

19:07.271 --> 19:09.273
You made my nightmare come true!

19:09.356 --> 19:10.566
I'm sorry, I'm...

19:11.275 --> 19:14.820
I'm very distracted.
There's a lot going on at home right now.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.029
Is it Sol?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.407
Is Sol making you terrible at theater?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.992
-What?
-You can tell me.

19:20.909 --> 19:21.743
No.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.165
Sol and I went to a therapist

19:26.665 --> 19:31.879
who brought up the idea of a...
open relationship.

19:32.379 --> 19:33.338
Yeah?

19:33.755 --> 19:38.302
And now, he's at home with a younger,
very attractive man.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.930
Oh. So you gave him the go-ahead
and now you're regretting it.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.848
What go-ahead?

19:42.931 --> 19:45.809
The go-ahead,
to go ahead with the very attractive man.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.060
No, no, no!

19:47.144 --> 19:49.938
We're not gonna do
the open relationship thing.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.983
-Then why give him the go-ahead?
-I didn't give him the go-ahead!

19:53.567 --> 19:59.823
Look, Jeff and I have an open relationship
and it's really worked out for us.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.492
No, we're very traditional.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.746
Robert, practically every gay couple

20:05.829 --> 20:07.581
who's been together
a certain amount of time

20:07.664 --> 20:09.875
have some type of open relationship.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.586
That can't be true. Is it?

20:13.086 --> 20:16.340
Yes. You just have rules.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.550
Never with the same person more than once.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.761
Never in our bed.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
And never with Stevie Mazza,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.641
because I'm pretty sure he stole my Rolex.

20:26.099 --> 20:27.935
I don't think I can ever do that.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.478
Does Sol want to do it?

20:29.561 --> 20:31.563
Because I could understand if he does.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.816
He's only had this experience with you.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.819
You at least had the Navy.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.156
I'm just being crazy.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.369
Sol insists that Roy is just a friend
from the folk cruise.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.871
-Folk cruise?
-That's where they met.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.122
Folk cruise?

20:49.748 --> 20:52.918
Robert, your story isn't making any sense,

20:53.335 --> 20:54.878
and it's upsetting me.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.131
You said that he was attractive
and that's why I was listening to you.

20:59.299 --> 21:01.593
Let's take it from the top.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.934
I don't understand. When I gave you
the company, it was on solid footing.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.311
-I know.
-How did this happen?

21:11.395 --> 21:13.480
-I don't know.
-It's your job to know!

21:13.563 --> 21:17.109
I know! Jesus, Mom. This is hard enough.
I don't need you throwing it in my face.

21:17.192 --> 21:18.235
Well, maybe you do.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.988
Because you've managed
to destroy everything I built.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.616
-And you don't even know how.
-I do know how.

21:24.700 --> 21:27.411
Because of that one wrinkle cream
you rushed to market?

21:27.494 --> 21:28.912
Yes. And...

21:28.996 --> 21:29.830
And what?

21:29.913 --> 21:33.583
And several old products
that nobody buys anymore.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.210
Like what?

21:41.633 --> 21:43.593
Like the entire original line, Mom.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.430
My original line?

21:46.513 --> 21:48.307
Yes. That's why we're in this mess.

21:48.390 --> 21:51.268
Then you're doing something wrong,
'cause that stuff sells itself.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.519
No, not anymore.

21:52.602 --> 21:57.274
Well, then rebrand it! My God, Brianna,
this is Business School 101.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.651
You know, everything old is new again.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.154
And sometimes, Mom, it's just old.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.494
Four-thirty? Oh, my God.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.204
That'll be $21.73.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.123
Are you cool with $15.10?

22:13.206 --> 22:14.041
No.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.209
Fine, I don't need my Big Slurp.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.461
Ma'am, you already drank it.

22:17.544 --> 22:21.923
Look, I can explain. I ran out of cash
because my cash card isn't working

22:22.049 --> 22:23.216
because I'm dead.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.969
-You're dead?
-Just legally, obviously.

22:26.053 --> 22:28.889
Look, if I could just call my son.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.057
To tell him you're dead?

22:30.140 --> 22:32.309
No! He already knows I'm dead!

22:32.392 --> 22:36.605
To tell him I followed an ice-cream truck
to Mexico with our baby!

22:36.688 --> 22:38.023
Your baby with your son?

22:38.106 --> 22:40.400
No, Jesus! Please!

22:40.484 --> 22:41.651
Look, give me your phone,

22:41.735 --> 22:45.363
or the charger cord
for my original offer of $15.10!

22:46.406 --> 22:48.950
I'm a very important customer
at this chain!

22:49.034 --> 22:51.078
-No. Give me your drink back.
-No!

22:54.247 --> 22:56.416
You let go of my drink.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.712
That is assault.

23:39.584 --> 23:42.629
could teach you how to play
"Keep My Skillet Good and Greasy"?

23:42.712 --> 23:45.423
I would say you do so at your own peril.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.760
My ex-wife tried to teach me
to play guitar once.

23:48.844 --> 23:51.179
We both ended up in the emergency room.

23:53.557 --> 23:57.018
All right, I'll go easy on you,
if you go easy on me.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.646
-Deal.
-Okay.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.692
All right. Right here. Yeah.

24:03.775 --> 24:05.527
Boy, you have nice hands.

24:06.069 --> 24:07.654
One's bigger than the other.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.866
You're adorable. Okay.

24:14.452 --> 24:15.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:16.788 --> 24:17.747
I'm sorry. I--

24:18.748 --> 24:20.208
I thought we...

24:20.584 --> 24:22.502
I thought that's what we were doing.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.714
We are not. I'm married.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.717
Yeah, to Robert,
the guy who gave us the go-ahead.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.428
What go-ahead?

24:31.511 --> 24:35.182
I'm sorry. Did I get that wrong?
I thought he told us to have fun.

24:35.265 --> 24:37.058
-Did he?
-Yeah.

24:38.518 --> 24:40.145
Oh, no, he...

24:42.397 --> 24:44.357
Oh, no, he didn't mean it like that.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.152
Oh, God, I'm... I'm so sorry. I...

24:47.569 --> 24:50.655
No, I'm sorry if I gave you
the wrong impression.

24:54.492 --> 24:58.038
No, it's cool. Sol, it's cool. Really.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.958
It's fine.
I guess I shaved my legs for nothing.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.962
♪ Wow, wow, wow, wow ♪

25:06.046 --> 25:08.006
♪ Wow, wow, wow ♪

25:08.089 --> 25:09.883
Whoo!

25:09.966 --> 25:10.967
Wow.

25:17.849 --> 25:21.436
At least the policeman was nice.
I can't say the same for the cashier.

25:22.604 --> 25:25.023
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.567
-Are you sure it wasn't another TIA?
-Yes.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.154
Well, then what the fuck were you doing?

25:31.238 --> 25:33.615
I was trying to buy a charger cord.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.951
No, before that. When you drove to Mexico.

25:36.409 --> 25:38.537
There was this ice cream truck,
so I followed it.

25:38.620 --> 25:42.540
And then the signs got weird
and the cashier put his hands on me.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.584
That's assault. End of story.

25:44.668 --> 25:45.543
Not end of story.

25:45.627 --> 25:46.962
But that is what happened.

25:47.545 --> 25:48.964
And it can never happen again.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.340
What does that mean?

25:50.423 --> 25:52.175
I should've never burdened you with this.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.136
-Faith isn't a burden!
-It is clearly too much for you.

25:55.220 --> 25:58.014
Driving, plus the baby,
just the two of you alone.

25:58.098 --> 26:01.559
Look, I'm not senile.
And I'm not stroking out.

26:01.935 --> 26:05.063
This is about one thing, Bud:
me being dead.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.816
Everything will be fine
once I get alive again.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.989
-Bud?
-We'll talk about it later.

26:26.876 --> 26:27.794
Hello.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.838
Welcome home.

26:33.675 --> 26:34.926
How'd it go with Roy?

26:37.053 --> 26:40.015
It was... fine.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.766
We played music.

26:42.892 --> 26:44.185
Sorry I missed it.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.854
How was rehearsal?

26:46.521 --> 26:48.732
Like the first half of Full Metal Jacket.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.990
You were right about Roy.
He came on to me.

26:58.992 --> 26:59.868
Oh?

27:01.536 --> 27:02.370
Yeah.

27:04.414 --> 27:05.457
Wow.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.293
Yeah.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.255
Did anything happen?

27:12.672 --> 27:13.882
Of course not!

27:15.050 --> 27:16.051
Did you...

27:16.926 --> 27:18.595
wish that maybe...

27:20.555 --> 27:22.974
something could maybe...

27:23.933 --> 27:24.768
happen?

27:24.851 --> 27:29.022
I had great trepidation
about even learning to play the guitar!

27:34.611 --> 27:38.323
So you had no interest in him
or his guitar?

27:38.406 --> 27:41.868
Well, if I'd been single, I don't know,

27:42.619 --> 27:44.245
I might have been interested.

27:45.288 --> 27:46.373
I mean...

27:47.248 --> 27:48.875
it was kind of flattering.

27:48.958 --> 27:52.087
So, if I had given you the go-ahead,

27:52.921 --> 27:55.173
you might have done something?

27:56.508 --> 27:59.302
What is this go-ahead
that everybody knows about?

27:59.386 --> 28:03.098
I know!
I only just learned about it today.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.557
Do you ever get the feeling

28:04.641 --> 28:07.977
there's this whole world out there
we don't even know exists?

28:08.061 --> 28:09.938
Yes. Very much so.

28:10.772 --> 28:16.069
I guess we just have to figure out
how much of it we want to know.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.621
Hank?

28:29.332 --> 28:30.333
Hank!

28:31.000 --> 28:32.043
Hank!

28:38.675 --> 28:39.676
Oh, my...

28:41.261 --> 28:42.303
Hank!

28:45.849 --> 28:46.850
Oh.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.230
What the hell happened?

28:53.398 --> 28:54.816
I got lost.
