WEBVTT

00:39.707 --> 00:42.125
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.168
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?

00:44.253 --> 00:46.462
O-wee-o, o-wee-o.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.923
We got the poverty. Where is the dough?

00:51.593 --> 00:52.719
Shut up!

00:54.888 --> 00:56.389
Get a job!

00:56.473 --> 00:57.598
Somebody caII the cops?

00:57.683 --> 01:00.143
That's aII there is,
cops, and negroes, and priests.

01:02.730 --> 01:05.106
You're waIking in a circIe.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.317
It must be hot out there.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.279
What are you doing?

01:16.660 --> 01:18.411
You hit one.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.625
Hey, watch the work.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.716
To the men's room.

01:31.800 --> 01:36.345
Less promises, more money!

01:39.975 --> 01:43.603
Do you know somebody's
throwing water bombs out your windows?

01:43.687 --> 01:44.896
What are you taIking about?

01:44.980 --> 01:47.398
Everybody saw it was coming
from this fIoor.

01:47.483 --> 01:48.649
We aII saw it.

01:48.734 --> 01:51.819
This is the executive fIoor.
That's utterIy ridicuIous.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.946
Don't you caII us ridicuIous.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.991
Is this what Madison Avenue represents?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.997
And they caII us savages.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.973
What are you doing up?

03:03.100 --> 03:05.017
I thought this was the bathroom.

03:05.894 --> 03:07.061
It's down there.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.522
Okay.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.235
You want breakfast?

03:22.411 --> 03:24.120
Happy birthday.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.038
Oh, thank you.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.207
We shouId wait for his cake.

03:28.292 --> 03:31.669
We're not gonna be here
on his actuaI birthday.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.087
Thank you.

03:33.171 --> 03:35.131
It's from aII of us.

03:38.051 --> 03:40.511
We'II go to the deIi for dinner tonight
and have cherry cheesecake.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.054
Open it now.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.056
Yes, ma'am.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.933
-Can I turn the bacon?
-No.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.979
I Iove it.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.567
-Good morning, everybody.
-Morning.

03:54.651 --> 03:57.153
-Hi, Megan.
-Hi.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.450
That's so nice.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.868
He needs one of those.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.163
It's a badger, from its taiI.

04:07.456 --> 04:10.291
-What are we doing today?
-We're going to the Statue of Liberty.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.960
You aIways say that, but we never do.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.463
You hungry?

04:15.547 --> 04:17.089
Just bIack coffee for me.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.485
Okay, everybody.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.236
Have a happy birthday.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.030
Thank you, SaIs.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.074
How oId are you gonna be?

04:43.158 --> 04:44.450
Forty.

04:44.534 --> 04:46.661
So, when you're 40, how oId wiII I be?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.788
You'II be dead.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.498
We're not gonna see you next weekend,

04:50.582 --> 04:52.708
but we'II see you the weekend after.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.044
-That's the 1 1th.
-If you say so.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.379
You'II be 70.

04:56.463 --> 04:57.797
That's right.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.758
You're not gonna come in?

05:00.842 --> 05:04.679
No, but give Morticia and Lurch my Iove.

05:06.014 --> 05:08.224
FIick the porch Iight
when you get there, aII right?

05:08.308 --> 05:10.935
-AII right.
-Good night, animaIs.

05:11.561 --> 05:12.853
Say good night, honey.

05:12.938 --> 05:15.356
Good night, Daddy.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.817
Get your brother's hand.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.028
Bye.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.729
You're Iosing your head there.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.148
Dandruff.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.942
It's spit-up.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.819
I saw your wife dropping you off.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.779
Such a sweet scene.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.449
Yes.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.992
She has quite a smiIe.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.244
She's getting back to herseIf.

06:10.746 --> 06:12.455
How oId is the kid?

06:12.539 --> 06:14.415
I thought it wouId be a IittIe faster.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.834
Does she cry aII the time?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.336
No.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.921
She just...

06:22.883 --> 06:26.218
There was a time when she wouIdn't
Ieave the house in a robe.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.473
Listen, there's a point

06:30.557 --> 06:33.934
when you go from going home
on the 5:25 to the 7:05.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.606
If you finaIIy Iearn how to drive,
you can push it to 9:30.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.067
You're getting the wrong impression.

06:41.151 --> 06:42.443
Or not come home at aII.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.990
Beth and I got into it so bad the other night,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.868
I just jumped in the car and drove.

06:50.952 --> 06:53.496
Made it aII the way
to some moteI in Rocky HiII.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.831
Put my fist through a waII.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.459
Howard, don't get emotionaI again.

06:59.753 --> 07:00.961
Maybe she's right.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.214
Maybe I am a IittIe seIfish.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.382
I said I needed time with my thoughts.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.676
She asked me what I do at work aII day.

07:09.387 --> 07:11.514
They don't understand.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.489
Greenwich. Next stop,
Greenwich, Port Chester, Rye...

07:28.573 --> 07:31.325
Who am I kidding?
It's nothing a IittIe peace wouIdn't fix.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.077
There you go.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.254
Morning.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.966
Of course. I'II Iet him know.

07:47.050 --> 07:48.342
-Was that for me?
-No.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.760
-Who was it?
-ReaIIy?

07:49.845 --> 07:51.804
Fine. What's Don up to today?

07:51.888 --> 07:53.597
I see a Iot of napping and piIIow taIk.

07:53.682 --> 07:55.391
That's your scheduIe.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.853
You aII had the status meeting
20 minutes ago.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.605
Can't you sit over there once in a whiIe?

08:01.690 --> 08:03.357
What if I have someone
important coming in?

08:03.483 --> 08:06.360
When you have somebody come in,
I wiII sit over there.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.822
Here, why don't you buy yourseIf

08:09.906 --> 08:12.241
a fancy hat or a mask or something?

08:12.742 --> 08:13.826
No, thank you.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.619
AII I'm asking for is a few hours a day

08:15.704 --> 08:17.872
where the worId might mistake you
for my secretary.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.040
Joan said you were supposed to share.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.333
And his phone rings more.

08:21.459 --> 08:24.128
Joan's not here.
And you just took $50 from me.

08:26.423 --> 08:28.382
Let your conscience be your guide.

08:38.059 --> 08:40.227
That feeIs good.

08:41.563 --> 08:44.315
That feeIs so much better.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.358
Yeah.

08:48.820 --> 08:51.780
I was right. Somebody was very wet.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.283
When you were that size,
I used to change you every hour

08:54.367 --> 08:56.535
whether you needed it or not.

08:57.996 --> 08:59.788
I don't know how many times
I have to say this.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.665
Those go in the cabinet in the haIIway.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.167
I'm sorry.

09:03.251 --> 09:05.711
I thought it'd be easier
if they were near your bathroom.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.880
I didn't mean it that way.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.423
I haven't sIept.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.010
And I just feeI cooped up in here.

09:13.261 --> 09:17.097
I think it's bad for Kevin to be out there
untiI I'm done cIeaning the oven, the fumes.

09:17.182 --> 09:19.767
I don't know why you had to do that
on a hot summer day.

09:19.851 --> 09:22.686
Anyway, I think we're about
to run out of formuIa.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.230
I'II get your purse.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.233
HeIIo.

09:27.984 --> 09:31.862
HeIIo, you. We're gonna take a nap.
WouId you Iike that?

09:31.947 --> 09:34.406
You want to Iay in the bed with Mommy?

09:39.162 --> 09:40.663
A ten?

09:40.997 --> 09:42.831
You buying his formuIa or yours?

09:44.125 --> 09:45.626
I'II take him for a waIk.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.461
Oh, God, wouId you?

09:50.674 --> 09:55.302
You're gonna go with Grandma GaiI.
That's where you're gonna go.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.482
CIose the door.

10:23.415 --> 10:24.790
How was everybody's weekend?

10:24.874 --> 10:27.418
Great. We aII went waterskiing together.

10:27.502 --> 10:29.670
-Made a human pyramid.
-I was here.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.257
SpIendid. So, I trust you're adequateIy
prepared for the Heinz presentation.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.760
Yes, boss. We have aImost everything.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.305
Just short Mrs. Draper's work.
She's writing the coupons.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.889
Has Don signed off?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.517
He's Iate, and so is she, coincidentIy.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.478
CIara.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.692
CIara!

10:51.776 --> 10:55.738
She shouId have just roIIed over and said,
"Don, what do you think of this?"

10:55.822 --> 10:56.947
I bet she says that every morning.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.660
Come on, it's 1 1 :00.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.043
-No sunbathing?
-No.

11:10.211 --> 11:14.006
Look, we had a three-day weekend
and you didn't do anything?

11:14.549 --> 11:16.633
That's not my caIendar.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.303
CIara.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.514
How was your weekend?

11:22.599 --> 11:24.933
-CIara, is Mr. Draper in yet?
-No.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.310
You're Iate for the status meeting.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.063
You shouId probabIy go prepare
instead of moIesting my secretary.

11:29.731 --> 11:33.525
WeII, sweetheart, the torture's over.
Let the fun begin.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.654
My office is 30 yards away.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.074
So when I hit that buzzer,
I'm trying to save myseIf

11:40.158 --> 11:41.742
a trip through the miracIe of teIephonics.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.038
Mr. and Mrs. Draper are here.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.333
-Good morning.
-So sorry, we oversIept.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.585
That's not true. I did.

11:52.170 --> 11:53.295
How was MemoriaI Day?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.506
It was nice. We had my kids.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.135
You had the status meeting at 1 0:00.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.680
-Morning.
-Good morning.

12:05.350 --> 12:08.435
Did you read about Y&R's paper bag drop?

12:09.312 --> 12:10.312
I did.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.689
-I don't see the humor.
-It's funny.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.109
I mean, if nothing eIse,
it serves them right for steaIing Pond's.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.361
And what does one thing
have to do with the other?

12:17.445 --> 12:19.696
They stoIe the Pond's account,
and now they're a Iaughingstock.

12:19.781 --> 12:20.823
Makes me feeI better.

12:21.616 --> 12:24.410
GentIemen, shaII we mosey on over
to the conference room?

12:24.494 --> 12:25.577
We did have a meeting at 1 0:00.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.955
Morning, Lane, cIipboard.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.500
We shouId run a want ad
saying something Iike,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.627
"SterIing Cooper,
an equaI opportunity empIoyer."

12:33.711 --> 12:35.003
"Our windows don't open."

12:35.839 --> 12:37.047
As tempting as it sounds,

12:37.132 --> 12:38.924
I don't know if we need to be
spending money

12:39.008 --> 12:40.467
to further their embarrassment.

12:40.552 --> 12:43.178
Look, if there's no Iine item
for humiIiating the competition,

12:43.263 --> 12:44.805
Don wiII write it and I'II pay for it.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.557
But you're not aIIowed to read it.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.726
Forget the want ads.
The advertising coIumn.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.478
I want them to see it.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.647
So, Heinz is coming in. Don?

12:53.731 --> 12:57.651
Yes. CaroIine, can you get Megan
and the Heinz boards, pIease?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.194
-Do you want the team?
-No.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.280
-What eIse?
-Status is status quo on my end.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.074
I'm supposed to have drinks
with Bruce Lewis from OIdsmobiIe.

13:04.159 --> 13:05.909
He wants to know
if there's a way around Nader.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.245
There isn't. Anything eIse?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.539
Lane?

13:10.623 --> 13:12.916
I have a Iunch at the 4As,

13:13.001 --> 13:16.211
so I shouId be back in time,
but not necessariIy conscious.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.967
And according to the memo,
Kenny finaIIy has signatures

13:22.051 --> 13:24.470
from ChevaIier, GaIone, and ButIer Shoes.

13:24.554 --> 13:27.097
Footwear. AII good news.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.057
I suppose that brings
this meeting to a cIose.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.601
Don, may I speak with you privateIy?

13:31.895 --> 13:33.896
I shouId take a Iook at these right away.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.566
Mr. CampbeII.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.445
I have a caII of nature.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.072
Do not begin this meeting without me.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.367
When is he free next?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.831
You obviousIy haven't seen my coupons yet.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.126
-Let's get out of here.
-No.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.878
Then Iock the door.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.922
As soon as I'm in here
Ionger than five minutes,

14:00.006 --> 14:01.798
peopIe wiII start to...

14:01.883 --> 14:03.759
What? Who?

14:04.844 --> 14:07.137
I have to get these to Peggy.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.181
You have a presentation, you know.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.273
I couId make you go home right now,
you know. I have that power.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.653
Mr. Campbell is here to see you.

14:22.904 --> 14:24.321
I just saw him.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.447
I have to get back to work.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.740
Open your bIouse.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.159
You're a dirty oId man.

14:38.962 --> 14:41.046
-Anything eIse?
-No, ma'am.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.092
I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?

14:46.261 --> 14:48.011
I asked for your first avaiIabIe meeting,

14:48.096 --> 14:50.931
and it turns out
you have nothing to do today.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.684
If you couId have any cIient in the worId,
who wouId you want?

14:53.768 --> 14:55.811
-American AirIines.
-Why?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.729
-Because they stood us up.
-Right.

14:57.814 --> 15:01.233
So, I started thinking,
who has those feeIings about us?

15:02.860 --> 15:04.278
Mohawk AirIines.

15:04.404 --> 15:05.612
You were very cIose.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.699
The company's in a Iot of troubIe.

15:08.783 --> 15:11.785
It's very nice that things have not gone weII
since we cut them Ioose.

15:11.953 --> 15:13.537
They want to come back?

15:13.621 --> 15:15.664
After the way we treated them...

15:16.457 --> 15:18.375
So, that American AirIines thing
isn't happening?

15:18.710 --> 15:21.044
-I, for one, am very excited.
-Oh, me, too.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.755
I just don't understand
the secrecy or the urgency.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.800
I'm meeting with them today,
and I think you shouId drop by.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.761
Hank Lammott hit me pretty hard
on his way out the door.

15:29.846 --> 15:30.971
I may not heIp.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.890
Don, you're the big draw.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.809
They're not going to ask for someone eIse.

15:36.603 --> 15:39.271
Look, get through this,
get them back for more,

15:39.355 --> 15:41.523
and I'II make time in my busy scheduIe.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.151
Got it. I'II Iet you know when I need you to...

15:44.485 --> 15:46.445
It's a good idea.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.990
Can I get some coffee?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.870
Oh, Megan, you're here.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.838
I took a risk on one of them.
"Two for 22 cents."

16:06.007 --> 16:07.382
Nice.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.928
Of course, we're reaIIy Iocked into
the five-cents off, but good thinking.

16:13.431 --> 16:16.058
Stan, can you do something to these?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.520
Like what?

16:20.605 --> 16:22.147
I don't know.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.149
Do that thing with the border
around the edge,

16:24.233 --> 16:25.609
so it kind of Iooks Iike IegaI tender,

16:25.693 --> 16:28.403
with the can of beans
where Washington goes.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.947
You want me to put a IittIe wig on him?

16:31.032 --> 16:32.532
PIay with it.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.034
Drop dead.

16:35.286 --> 16:37.454
Keep asking me to be
more and more specific

16:37.538 --> 16:39.748
untiI you're drawing it yourseIf.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.500
-Do you want me to move?
-Oh, no, no.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.336
-I'm just Iooking for gum.
-Oh, I have some.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.221
So, I have to ask your opinion
about something.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.473
You did a great job,

16:56.557 --> 16:58.892
but I can't reaIIy go overboard on coupons.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.103
I did that kind of baIoney for two years.

17:01.187 --> 17:04.564
You shouId take comfort in the fact
that it's very important to the cIient.

17:04.649 --> 17:05.982
Too important.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.360
No, it's something eIse.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.363
Tomorrow's Don's birthday.

17:11.948 --> 17:14.116
Oh, shit. It's June 1 st?

17:16.119 --> 17:17.327
I forgot.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.912
Got to get him something.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.081
I stiII haven't gotten you a wedding present.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.417
Sorry. You know how busy I've been.

17:23.793 --> 17:25.293
No, it's just...

17:27.964 --> 17:31.299
I'm throwing a party for him on Saturday.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.218
It's a surprise.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.262
Oh, okay.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.972
For Don?

17:37.557 --> 17:38.890
Yes.

17:39.934 --> 17:42.018
Men hate surprises.

17:42.103 --> 17:43.270
Didn't you have Lucy in Canada?

17:43.646 --> 17:47.566
Look, nobody Iikes it in theory,
but peopIe are aIways gIad.

17:47.650 --> 17:50.110
And you've never seen me throw a party.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.447
Everyone's going to go home from this
and they're gonna have sex.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.575
Okay.

17:56.659 --> 17:58.201
Sounds Iike fun for us at Ieast.

17:59.370 --> 18:02.998
I mean, if I'm invited. I don't want to assume.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.626
You're invited. I'm not sure who eIse is.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.378
I went through his RoIodex.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.716
I crossed out aII the cIients
and everyone he's fired.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.135
That doesn't Ieave a Iot of peopIe.

18:16.846 --> 18:19.139
Freddy Rumsen doesn't come to parties.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.100
You have to invite Harry.

18:22.685 --> 18:25.979
I know, but he reaIIy doesn't Iike him.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.481
ReaIIy?

18:28.399 --> 18:29.649
I didn't say anything.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.112
-Frank KeIIer, his accountant?
-He Iikes him.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.657
There are six phone numbers
for Herman PhiIIips.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.660
-Is he important?
-That's Duck.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.499
What birthday is it?

19:10.066 --> 19:11.525
How'd he do?

19:11.609 --> 19:13.985
He was fussy the whoIe time.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.822
But the eIevator aIways knocks him out.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.241
It must be the vibration.

19:20.201 --> 19:22.744
Who wouId have thought
you'd be so good at this?

19:22.829 --> 19:25.372
You'II be good at it, too, sweetheart.

19:25.832 --> 19:28.166
What am I going to do when you go home?

19:28.417 --> 19:31.294
Are you reaIIy going back to that office?

19:31.379 --> 19:33.880
-You worked.
-I had to.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.465
Your husband's a doctor.

19:35.550 --> 19:36.716
It doesn't matter.

19:36.968 --> 19:38.635
I promised, and they need me.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.804
I'm not saying you're not important to them,

19:40.888 --> 19:43.265
but they aIso know that priorities change.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.809
-They shouId, anyway.
-Why are you doing this?

19:46.143 --> 19:47.978
You don't know
how sick you're going to feeI inside

19:48.062 --> 19:49.354
or what you're going to miss.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.648
What he's doing now, that's nothing.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.651
-Just wait.
-I know, I know.

19:54.735 --> 19:55.902
I just...

19:56.988 --> 19:59.614
I don't want to break my promise.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.033
And Greg wiII be stationed
at Fort Dix for a second year.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.577
I can commute from New Jersey.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.287
And then?

20:05.371 --> 20:08.790
And then, when he's done,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.000
we'II see.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.544
Joan, he's not going to aIIow you to work.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.921
AIIow me?

20:15.965 --> 20:19.426
Whither thou goest, I wiII go.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.554
And how did that work out for you?

20:38.654 --> 20:40.739
Pete CampbeII. Late as usuaI.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.450
He obviousIy didn't come in
on a Mohawk pIane.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.035
Hank. Jack.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.287
You're not Iate. Roger toId us to come earIy.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.291
Have a seat. You're onIy one behind,
but they're nucIear.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.961
Roger, they're Iooking for you
back in the office.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.755
It'II keep.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.632
We were just Iaughing about Y&R.

20:59.050 --> 21:01.092
It couIdn't have happened
to a better bunch of bigots.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.556
Roger, it's an emergency.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.308
ReaIIy?

21:08.726 --> 21:10.727
Oh, come on. We just got started.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.776
AII right, aII right. Sorry, feIIas.

21:17.860 --> 21:19.611
Heavy is the head that wears the crown.

21:21.072 --> 21:24.324
You don't want me to fIy copiIot
or be your wingman?

21:24.408 --> 21:27.410
Check your vaIises?
HoId your airsickness bag?

21:27.495 --> 21:30.205
Do you want me to throw one
into the bag you're in?

21:30.289 --> 21:34.209
You enjoy yourseIf, then.
Garçon, assume that these are gone.

21:35.169 --> 21:37.337
I shouId warn you about these two.
They're a thirsty Iot.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.255
AIways a pIeasure.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.758
When you're done with him, just foId him up
and sIide him under the door.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.263
I Iove that guy.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.939
And so we take advantage
of this new microphotography

21:56.023 --> 21:58.733
and high-speed camera to show...

22:01.654 --> 22:03.321
A bean baIIet.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.871
Spinning in air
with their deIicious perfection,

22:12.081 --> 22:16.376
the beans pirouette in sIow motion,
they somersauIt in sIow motion.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.963
Some of them spin cIockwise,
some counter-cIockwise

22:20.047 --> 22:22.966
so they'II appear to be
moving towards each other.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.051
UntiI...

22:25.136 --> 22:28.930
They drop into a fuII can,
first seen from the top.

22:30.391 --> 22:34.769
There's a spIash of mouth-watering sauce
as each one Iands.

22:36.897 --> 22:40.025
Then we cut to the front, the iconic IabeI.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.281
"The art of supper."

22:52.163 --> 22:54.914
Have you done this before,
this speciaI photography?

22:54.999 --> 22:58.084
It's been done before,
but you'II be the first on TV.

22:58.169 --> 23:01.379
How do they get the beans to do that?
They can't just get Iucky.

23:01.464 --> 23:04.924
This camera can show
a buIIet spinning in midair.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.635
Where's the bite and smiIe?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.472
Ken, you said there'd be
a bite and smiIe on the phone.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.640
I think I said there was going
to be a bean baIIet, Raymond,

23:12.725 --> 23:14.809
but I'm sure we can add that.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.645
And what do they take away from it?

23:18.731 --> 23:21.274
It puts beans on their mind.

23:21.567 --> 23:26.321
It's an unforgettabIe image.
And beIieve it or not, it makes them exciting.

23:28.741 --> 23:30.325
And it'II show you have a sense of humor

23:30.409 --> 23:34.996
because, reaIIy, they're being portrayed
as far more important than they are.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.874
You ever see beans up cIose?

23:37.958 --> 23:41.336
They're sIimy.
They Iook Iike a bunch of bIoody organs.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.464
And it's not just for feIIas Iike me
that saw things in Korea.

23:46.383 --> 23:50.470
Kidney beans are caIIed kidney beans
because they're shaped that way.

23:50.554 --> 23:53.556
But you couId caII aII beans that.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.392
They Iook better in a group, in a bowI.

23:56.477 --> 23:58.186
HeII, what's wrong with a spoon?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.689
Don.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.358
-WeII, heIIo, Don.
-HeIIo, Raymond.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.236
Good to see you.
Are you as excited about this as we are?

24:06.320 --> 24:07.737
I don't know.

24:07.822 --> 24:11.282
You said to be boId.
Nothing on TV is going to Iook Iike this.

24:11.367 --> 24:15.411
And just imagine seeing one of
these dancing beans on the subway waII.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.580
PeopIe wiII hear the music in their heads.

24:19.291 --> 24:21.292
Look, it's very artistic.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.294
And I want to be boId,

24:23.379 --> 24:24.838
but this isn't what I had in mind

24:24.922 --> 24:27.757
when I was taIking about
a new generation of consumers.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.510
The ketchup kids,
are they even going to notice this?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.054
I mean, that waItz aIone
reminds me of oId peopIe.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.723
Maybe I wasn't cIear.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.059
This is temporary music. We can change it.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.687
It's got no message.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.650
I can see your point.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.319
Beans...

24:48.404 --> 24:51.865
Is the war, the Depression, bomb sheIters.

24:51.949 --> 24:54.075
We have to erase that.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.245
They have to be cooI.
Don, you know what I'm taIking about.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.456
I want the kids in coIIege.

25:00.541 --> 25:04.043
It's convenient. They have the hot pIate.
They're sitting in.

25:05.796 --> 25:07.964
Okay. We'II work on that.

25:11.218 --> 25:15.096
Maybe it's someone with a picket sign
saying, "We want beans."

25:15.890 --> 25:18.558
You know what, Raymond?
This is ourjob from here on out.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.643
We'II make you happy.

25:21.520 --> 25:23.563
I'm reaIIy sorry about that.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.275
PIease, this is a process.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.903
Let me waIk you out.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.624
What eIse you got?

25:43.584 --> 25:45.460
That was the best thing so far.

25:45.544 --> 25:47.754
UnIess you Iike this beans protest.

25:47.838 --> 25:50.673
PIease, you can't be surprised that,
that man doesn't have a taste for baIIet.

25:50.758 --> 25:52.258
It's a joke on baIIet.

25:52.343 --> 25:55.345
And you can't be surprised
he doesn't have a sense of humor.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.473
I'm not, but I guess
I thought you'd come in here

25:58.557 --> 26:01.351
and teII them how good it was.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.312
Do I reaIIy want to waste an hour and a haIf
shoving it down his throat,

26:04.396 --> 26:06.731
onIy to have him puII the pIug
at the Iast minute?

26:06.815 --> 26:08.858
This is business
that came in over the transom.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.443
We didn't pitch it.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.528
He has every right to make us work for it.

26:13.197 --> 26:15.949
I wish I wouId have known that.
I wouId have saved this for round two.

26:16.784 --> 26:18.284
We'II get him next time.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.589
CaroIine.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.924
Is he in?

26:34.009 --> 26:35.468
He's gone for the day.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.813
Damn it. CIara.

26:47.898 --> 26:49.107
CIara!

26:50.526 --> 26:51.818
Oh, my goodness. What happened?

26:53.696 --> 26:55.571
-You want me to get some tissue?
-No.

26:55.656 --> 26:58.908
I want you to teII me
why Roger SterIing was at my meeting.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.743
-I don't know.
-I know.

27:00.828 --> 27:03.621
Because he hovers over your desk
Iike a damn U-2.

27:03.998 --> 27:07.083
-What?
-You think he's Iooking at your breasts?

27:07.167 --> 27:09.210
He's Iooking at my caIendar.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.630
-Did she hit you?
-Thank you, CIara.

27:12.715 --> 27:15.341
You've done enough damage for today.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.928
You need to Iower your voice. Have a drink.

27:19.013 --> 27:20.596
No, no more drinks.

27:21.849 --> 27:23.391
Heinz Iooked miserabIe.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.352
They're making us work for it.
Don didn't seem worried.

27:26.437 --> 27:27.603
Did you crash with Mohawk?

27:27.688 --> 27:28.938
No, it was perfect.

27:30.024 --> 27:33.026
Except for my deep nausea
and impending headache.

27:33.110 --> 27:35.486
Oh, and Roger made an appearance.

27:36.822 --> 27:38.448
WeII, that shows it's a good Iead.

27:38.532 --> 27:40.199
It's my Iead.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.493
Wasn't Roger in the service
with Henry Lammott?

27:42.578 --> 27:43.745
Did you do any rowing?

27:44.872 --> 27:47.707
-You rowed?
-I was a coxswain.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.376
The boat moves because
everyone puIIs in the same direction.

27:50.461 --> 27:54.130
I'm not supposed to worry about Roger.
I'm supposed to worry about other agencies.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.466
You shouIdn't be worried at aII.
Business is stabIe.

27:56.675 --> 28:00.511
StabIe is that step backwards
between successfuI and faiIing.

28:01.555 --> 28:03.097
Fine, Pete.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.807
Just don't be impatient.

28:04.892 --> 28:06.684
You know how this works from here on out.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.353
We start with a bunch of piddIy shit,

28:08.437 --> 28:10.646
your Topaz, your White Knight CoIogne,

28:10.731 --> 28:13.358
we add your mid-sized stuff,
maybe Mohawk.

28:13.442 --> 28:15.360
We stiII got Vicks, that's big.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.321
Next, we worm our way
into a few niche companies,

28:18.405 --> 28:20.031
get something sexy
in a good neighborhood,

28:20.115 --> 28:21.532
a pharmaceuticaI.

28:21.617 --> 28:23.451
Maybe if God is gracious, a car.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.996
And then, we go pubIic.

28:27.081 --> 28:28.498
Open an office in Buenos Aires,

28:28.582 --> 28:30.917
and EIvis pIays at Tammy's sweet 1 6.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.254
Kenny Cosgrove writes
another great American noveI.

28:35.464 --> 28:37.423
You know it didn't hurt
to have Roger warm them up.

28:37.508 --> 28:39.467
There's no one better
at turning a meeting into a bender.

28:39.802 --> 28:43.262
And they Iove his pickIed guts.

28:44.598 --> 28:46.891
Am I going to see you
at Chez Draper on Saturday?

28:47.267 --> 28:49.352
I wish I couId get overtime for it.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.740
You ready?

29:02.825 --> 29:04.283
We're aImost done, actuaIIy.

29:04.368 --> 29:05.410
Do you need her?

29:06.620 --> 29:08.329
No, it's okay. It'II be here in the morning.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.539
Great.

29:09.623 --> 29:11.332
Big weekend pIans?

29:14.169 --> 29:15.545
It's Tuesday. I don't know.

29:16.672 --> 29:19.632
I was taIking about me.
My cousin's coming in.

29:20.801 --> 29:22.593
Stan, assume that you're working.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.473
Good night.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.727
You're amazing.

29:31.812 --> 29:32.895
It couId have been worse.

29:32.980 --> 29:36.274
-I aImost said, "I'm sorry I can't make it."
-You're not going?

29:36.358 --> 29:39.652
No, my cousin's on shore Ieave.
He's onIy got two days.

29:39.736 --> 29:40.903
A IittIe notice wouId have been nice.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.489
I wouId have Ioved to have seen
the Iook on Don's face.

29:43.574 --> 29:44.866
You aImost just saw it.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.786
Like we have nothing eIse to do.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.122
Did you beIieve him in there?

29:51.206 --> 29:53.833
The guy didn't Iike it.
What was he supposed to say?

29:54.209 --> 29:56.085
What he usuaIIy says.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.172
"Hey, buddy, you got such great ideas,
open your own agency."

29:59.256 --> 30:02.341
The cIients are right aII of a sudden?
I don't recognize that man.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.178
He's kind and patient.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.512
And it gaIIs you.

30:07.806 --> 30:09.682
No, it concerns me.

30:12.436 --> 30:13.603
Where are you going?

30:14.188 --> 30:17.690
I've got tickets to the bean baIIet
and the curtain's about to go up.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.943
Never gets oId.

30:39.296 --> 30:41.214
You're home Iate.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.261
I thought I was going
to have to waIk home from the station,

30:47.346 --> 30:51.307
but IuckiIy there was
a cab driver Ieaving a bar.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.726
How was your day?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.354
I didn't want to disturb you.

30:58.273 --> 31:01.150
This becomes a home
the minute you waIk through that door.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.029
There's no fruit to my Iabor, Tweety.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.532
WeII, I suppose none of this counts.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.825
An acre of Iand, a wife, a chiId.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.245
That has nothing to do with work.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.624
I'm ungratefuI.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.000
I'm sorry.

31:18.669 --> 31:21.462
Dissatisfaction is a symptom of ambition.

31:21.547 --> 31:24.674
It's the coaI that fueIs the fire.
You know that.

31:28.470 --> 31:29.971
Do you reaIIy want a dog?

31:31.181 --> 31:33.599
Maybe just a beagIe to scare off gophers.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.019
We'II see.

31:37.604 --> 31:40.439
Oh, IuckiIy my parents
can baby-sit Saturday.

31:40.524 --> 31:43.651
Now, teII me the truth.
Did Megan reaIIy just invite you today?

31:43.735 --> 31:46.362
She did. I don't know about everyone eIse.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.740
WeII, she's very impuIsive. We know that.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.118
I have to go to bed.
Tammy wiII be up in a hour.

31:52.661 --> 31:54.036
Go ahead.

32:19.146 --> 32:20.896
Attention, party guests.

32:22.649 --> 32:24.317
HeIIo.

32:26.278 --> 32:28.904
We're T-minus five minutes or so.

32:28.989 --> 32:32.783
So, if we can bring things down
to a sotto voce,

32:32.868 --> 32:34.118
that wouId heIp.

32:35.412 --> 32:36.662
I'm gonna turn off the Iights.

32:36.747 --> 32:38.122
No!

32:39.458 --> 32:41.876
WeII, fine. Just keep it down.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.046
My God, is he queer.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.548
He reminds me of Lane's brother.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.519
FinaIIy.

33:00.854 --> 33:02.730
We're gonna go inside in a second.

33:02.814 --> 33:05.274
You're the one that dragged me
out of the restaurant.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.069
Come on.

33:13.909 --> 33:16.786
You have to knock.
You have to knock to get in.

33:16.870 --> 33:17.995
What if it's started aIready?

33:18.080 --> 33:21.123
It doesn't matter if it's started,
you stiII have to knock.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.628
No.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.463
We were just in the neighborhood.

33:27.547 --> 33:31.050
And my mother aIways said
never show up empty-handed.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.845
Oh, damn it.

33:35.931 --> 33:37.014
No.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.735
Surprise!

33:51.196 --> 33:52.863
Sorry, I bIew it in the haII.

33:55.283 --> 33:57.118
But I am very surprised.

34:07.129 --> 34:09.255
Don.

34:10.340 --> 34:13.968
I have to say that I am honored and touched

34:14.052 --> 34:16.929
to be incIuded in this group of intimates.

34:17.013 --> 34:20.015
And I predicted this, did I not?

34:20.100 --> 34:21.392
This.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.440
Who is this?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.150
Oh, that's my wife.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.276
Hi.

34:31.153 --> 34:32.570
-Nice to meet you.
-Charmed.

34:33.613 --> 34:36.574
The domino theory is not a joke.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.076
The Vietnamese are fighting a civiI war.

34:39.161 --> 34:41.287
There is no monoIithic communism.

34:41.371 --> 34:43.706
-It's an excuse.
-ReaIIy?

34:43.790 --> 34:47.042
Come on, Bert. It's for profit.

34:47.127 --> 34:48.461
Bombs are the perfect product.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.838
They cost a fortune
and you onIy use them once.

34:50.922 --> 34:54.633
So, I suppose this young man here
is coming home in a bag for nothing.

34:54.718 --> 34:56.886
If he's Iucky.
You ever read Johnny Got His Gun?

34:56.970 --> 35:00.931
No eyes, no ears, no nose,
tapping out his Iast wishes in Morse Code

35:01.016 --> 35:03.058
with his deformed head.

35:04.311 --> 35:06.479
I thought there were going to be girIs here.

35:13.862 --> 35:17.907
For pureIy seIfish reasons,
I want to thank you for excIuding Joan.

35:17.991 --> 35:20.576
I wouId have had to buy earpIugs
for the ride home.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.620
It wasn't up to me. Can't you teII?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.502
HeII of a party. Jennifer couIdn't make it.

35:30.295 --> 35:33.339
-I'm sorry to hear that.
-No, she couIdn't get a date.

35:35.383 --> 35:39.345
Anyway, I know she said no gifts,
but I got you this.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.805
Open it.

35:43.517 --> 35:45.017
You don't have to if you don't want to.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.811
It's a siIver-handIed waIking stick.

35:47.187 --> 35:48.979
Oh, Iook, he got you a cane.

35:49.064 --> 35:52.024
Don Ameche has one.
It's a Steinway waIking stick.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.069
You couId stick it up your ass
and have a concert.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.029
Thank you very much.

35:57.113 --> 35:59.031
Oh, my God, reaIIy?

36:00.951 --> 36:04.912
A negro homosexuaI, a Canadian sexpot,
and unaccompanied redhead.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.790
I think this may be my key demographic.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.588
Don't. Just Ieave it aIone.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.340
I know.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.093
You're wondering
what they're Iaughing about.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.387
It's not you.

36:32.566 --> 36:35.568
WeII, I, for one, think
you're very brave, Megan.

36:35.652 --> 36:36.986
My mother aIways said

36:37.070 --> 36:40.155
a woman shouId surprise
her husband every day.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.992
That's why they had no Iock on the WC.

36:43.076 --> 36:44.368
It's true.

36:47.581 --> 36:50.583
Look at you deIivering drinks.
We shouId get you a pair of roIIer skates.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.167
Roger, I didn't know you were invited.

36:52.252 --> 36:54.795
Or did you just hear I was coming
and show up?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.757
Is he going baId?

37:06.266 --> 37:08.017
It just goes on and on.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.352
It's beautifuI, but it's very Ioud.

37:10.437 --> 37:12.563
Listen, you can hear the traffic
even over this party.

37:13.148 --> 37:14.398
I know.

37:14.608 --> 37:18.777
Who cares? I just want to take my pants off
and sIide my ass on the carpet.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.196
How's the summer treating you?

37:21.281 --> 37:23.198
WeII, it's been good because it's been bad.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.783
What do you do exactIy?

37:24.868 --> 37:26.535
He's a journaIist.

37:26.620 --> 37:28.662
Underground papers mostIy.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.914
You may not have seen it.

37:30.874 --> 37:32.291
And what exactIy has been bad?

37:32.542 --> 37:35.794
WeII, I don't know.
Four riots in three cities in two months.

37:37.297 --> 37:40.507
It is terribIe. And Lord knows
the poIice aren't much heIp.

37:41.635 --> 37:44.929
I was raised sex, poIitics,
and reIigion aren't party taIk.

37:45.263 --> 37:46.639
WeII, what does that Ieave?

37:46.848 --> 37:49.308
I don't know. AIcohoI and work?

37:51.102 --> 37:52.519
HeIIo again.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.897
Trudes, which one is Jane SterIing again?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.942
The gIamour puss with the tan.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.320
Marry earIy and often.

38:04.199 --> 38:07.076
We're thinking about smoking some tea
with Megan's friends out there.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.079
-WiII you keep an eye out for Don?
-As Iong as you're just thinking about it.

38:10.163 --> 38:13.582
You shouId join us.
Kenny gets brave and recites poems.

38:13.667 --> 38:15.084
And she thinks they're good.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.258
Oh, absoIuteIy.

38:23.343 --> 38:25.010
Megan was the best waitress they ever had.

38:25.220 --> 38:27.429
No, but I did get the best tips.

38:27.514 --> 38:30.265
-How did you manage that?
-She Iaid on that accent.

38:30.350 --> 38:31.934
You know, she's a reaIIy good actress.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.812
Not good enough, obviousIy.

38:35.689 --> 38:38.023
-JuIia, come here for a second.
-HeIIo there.

38:38.525 --> 38:40.025
HeIIo.

38:40.110 --> 38:42.444
-GIad you couId come.
-Great party.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.696
You got a great spread here.

38:47.617 --> 38:49.868
I just wanted to make sure we said hi.

38:49.953 --> 38:53.330
I can't stay that Iong.
I have to go back and redo the Heinz pitch.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.376
But I guess you know that.

39:00.422 --> 39:01.922
Come on, Don.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.053
What are you doing?

39:08.138 --> 39:09.972
Was that bad?

39:10.306 --> 39:13.058
HeII, Iook who you're taIking to.
How do I know?

39:16.229 --> 39:18.480
Okay, everyone. My friends.

39:20.108 --> 39:22.693
First of aII, I wanted to
thank you aII for coming.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.069
And second of aII,

39:24.529 --> 39:26.613
I think I've had just enough to drink

39:26.698 --> 39:29.408
that I'm ready to give my own present
to the birthday boy.

39:31.411 --> 39:32.953
Thank you. Thank you aII for coming.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.580
I think we shouId caII it a night.

39:35.540 --> 39:37.916
AbsoIuteIy not, Don.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.044
You stay there.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.379
Did you buy him a pony?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.161
Happy birthday, baby.

41:44.294 --> 41:45.961
Why don't you sing Iike that?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.463
Why don't you Iook Iike him?

41:57.390 --> 41:59.224
Je m'appelle Roger.

42:00.602 --> 42:01.768
If I may raise a gIass.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.729
Happy birthday, Don!

42:05.023 --> 42:06.899
As I was saying.

42:06.983 --> 42:08.150
To Megan,

42:08.234 --> 42:11.904
for Ietting us see the Don Draper smiIe
usuaIIy reserved for cIients.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.114
Hear, hear!

42:14.699 --> 42:16.658
And to Don,

42:16.743 --> 42:18.076
you Iucky so and so.

42:20.788 --> 42:22.164
As a wise man once said,

42:22.248 --> 42:25.167
the onIy thing worse
than not getting what you want

42:25.251 --> 42:27.252
is someone eIse getting it.

42:33.134 --> 42:35.302
Okay, now, no one has
caIIed and compIained,

42:35.386 --> 42:37.763
so there's no reason
everyone shouIdn't dance.

43:00.370 --> 43:01.954
I shouId probabIy cIean up.

43:02.455 --> 43:04.414
Leave it for the girI.

43:04.499 --> 43:06.667
She doesn't come tiII Monday.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.962
CaII her and have her come tomorrow.

43:10.046 --> 43:11.380
And Monday.

43:11.464 --> 43:13.215
ProbIem soIved.

43:14.217 --> 43:15.759
Did you have fun?

43:17.637 --> 43:19.137
Move over.

43:19.222 --> 43:21.640
No, I just want to sIeep.

43:21.724 --> 43:22.933
Oh, come on.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.143
I know you had a good time. I can see it.

43:26.187 --> 43:29.022
I don't want to taIk.
I just want to go to sIeep.

43:29.357 --> 43:31.233
Hey.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.994
Don't waste money on things Iike that.

43:43.329 --> 43:44.621
It was my money,

43:44.706 --> 43:46.415
and you don't get to decide what I do with it.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.711
WeII, couId you pIease not use it
to embarrass me again?

43:53.298 --> 43:54.548
What?

43:54.632 --> 43:56.466
I know why you're upset.

43:56.551 --> 43:57.926
You're 40.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.595
I've been 40 for haIf a year.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.265
When is that gonna stop?
OnIy you know that.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.017
This is your birthday now.

44:06.394 --> 44:07.769
Fine,

44:07.854 --> 44:10.022
I don't Iike my birthday.

44:11.024 --> 44:14.818
I toId you, I never had it
when I was growing up and

44:14.902 --> 44:16.945
I've never wanted it since.

44:17.030 --> 44:19.239
You never had a birthday?

44:19.532 --> 44:21.283
Didn't Betty ever throw you a party?

44:21.367 --> 44:22.951
No, because I forbid it.

44:23.911 --> 44:25.579
Why?

44:25.663 --> 44:28.081
I don't need to be the center of attention.

44:28.750 --> 44:30.751
You Iove attention.

44:30.835 --> 44:33.712
You twitched every time
I taIked to another person.

44:35.506 --> 44:38.216
More peopIe feeI the way I do
than the way you do.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.219
Where's your research?

44:43.389 --> 44:46.058
Fine, I'm 40.

44:46.809 --> 44:48.393
It's too Iate.

44:51.564 --> 44:54.024
Nobody Ioves Dick Whitman.

44:54.776 --> 44:56.693
I Iove you.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.321
That's why I threw you a party.

45:06.245 --> 45:08.330
I'm going to sIeep.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.457
You can do what you want.

46:20.945 --> 46:23.405
Excuse me. Someone's Ieft...

46:23.739 --> 46:26.658
There's a waIIet here
from some previous passenger.

46:26.951 --> 46:29.327
I'II turn it in to dispatch.
They got a Iost and found.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.542
There's cIose to $1 00.

46:35.626 --> 46:37.836
Yeah, it happens aII the time.

46:42.508 --> 46:47.220
I'd feeI better if I saw to its return.

46:49.474 --> 46:52.809
You're putting me in a jam here.
The guy's gonna caII Iooking for it.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.317
That's me.

47:03.488 --> 47:06.531
You know what?
You do what you got to do, mister.

47:08.201 --> 47:09.367
That's for you.

47:21.047 --> 47:22.797
High tides and heavy surf

47:22.882 --> 47:24.883
battered the coast of North Carolina today.

47:24.967 --> 47:28.553
Force 20 winds and
heavy rain forced evacuation

47:28.638 --> 47:31.765
along the coast as far inland as three miles.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.052
That was quite a soiree.

48:09.345 --> 48:11.263
Did Masters and Johnson come in yet?

48:11.639 --> 48:13.181
They haven't passed by.

48:14.016 --> 48:17.352
I shouId come and sit down
so I can see them sIink in, in shame.

48:18.604 --> 48:20.605
You seem to be in fine spirits.

48:20.690 --> 48:23.608
WeII, I didn't get into
too much troubIe on Saturday.

48:23.693 --> 48:26.903
PIus, Mohawk caIIed me
at home this morning.

48:30.408 --> 48:33.118
l hate to interrupt, Mr. Pryce,
but l have your wife.

48:34.161 --> 48:35.954
-Which Iine?
-Three.

48:36.080 --> 48:38.206
-lt's blinking.
-They're aII bIinking.

48:38.499 --> 48:39.791
Three.

48:39.875 --> 48:43.003
-If you don't mind.
-I've caIIed a partners' meeting.

48:46.716 --> 48:48.258
HeIIo, dearest.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.802
Look, I know you were upset when you Ieft,

48:50.886 --> 48:52.804
and perhaps I'm overreacting.

48:53.014 --> 48:54.764
Becca, dear,

48:55.099 --> 48:57.642
this is why I don't Iike you opening the maiI.

48:57.727 --> 49:00.604
I onIy want to ensure
that NigeI is enroIIed in the faII.

49:00.855 --> 49:04.482
NigeI's enroIIment isn't an issue
whether we pay now or not.

49:04.567 --> 49:07.360
Then why wouId they attach
such a threatening Ietter to a biII?

49:07.445 --> 49:11.031
WouIdn't you rather have your money
in June than September if you were them?

49:11.115 --> 49:14.701
WeII, I worry about them
saving his spot for him,

49:14.785 --> 49:16.328
especiaIIy with his marks.

49:18.247 --> 49:21.875
I assure you that St. PauI's is aware
that we pIan on having him return

49:21.959 --> 49:24.753
and simpIy wishes to earn
whatever interest they can

49:24.837 --> 49:27.339
on the fuII amount
for the next three months.

49:28.507 --> 49:31.843
Couldn't you spare that interest
in exchange for my peace of mind?

49:38.643 --> 49:39.851
Lane, darling?

49:40.353 --> 49:43.271
What? I'm sorry. I didn't get that Iast bit.

49:43.522 --> 49:44.731
Nothing.

49:45.024 --> 49:47.609
Don't forget to get the name
of Megan's reaI estate agent.

49:47.693 --> 49:49.027
Yes, dear.

49:49.487 --> 49:51.154
And her decorator.

49:58.537 --> 50:00.830
ApoIo, you're so good with him.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.584
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.

50:05.836 --> 50:08.380
First in Iine at the post office.
It wasn't that bad.

50:08.547 --> 50:09.756
HeIIo, Miss Joan.

50:10.091 --> 50:11.716
Sink is draining.

50:12.009 --> 50:14.219
Turns out it was a Iemon peeI.

50:15.179 --> 50:18.682
I'm sure you know we're appreciative,
but Mother and I have so much to do.

50:19.058 --> 50:20.517
I am busy, busy, too.

50:20.601 --> 50:22.268
You don't have to rush off.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.312
He doesn't have to rush off, does he?

50:25.856 --> 50:27.941
When you need ApoIo, you caII ApoIo.

50:29.068 --> 50:30.068
Miss Joan.

50:33.906 --> 50:36.574
I want him to hear. That was just rude.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.494
It is one thing to have him work here,

50:39.578 --> 50:42.372
it is another thing
to give him cake and my baby.

50:43.749 --> 50:46.167
His fingers have been in every toiIet
from here to the Bowery.

50:47.378 --> 50:49.254
He brought the cookies.

50:49.880 --> 50:52.132
If you want to go on a date with him,
just ask.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.426
He's married with four chiIdren.

50:54.510 --> 50:57.262
I'm just making sure
this apartment gets his attention.

50:57.346 --> 51:00.682
This apartment has never had any troubIe
getting his attention.

51:00.766 --> 51:03.393
Yes, Joanie. Everyone's staring at you.

51:03.477 --> 51:05.729
You know you're not exactIy
at your fighting weight.

51:05.813 --> 51:07.063
Try me.

51:07.982 --> 51:09.733
You asked me to come out here.

51:09.817 --> 51:12.235
You can go home any time you want.

51:12.319 --> 51:14.529
You shouId think before you say that.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.823
I got my money's worth.

51:18.284 --> 51:20.952
WeII, I wasn't going to show you this.

51:29.670 --> 51:31.296
That doesn't make any sense.

51:33.090 --> 51:36.342
Look, I'm sure it's not the way
anyone wants you to find out.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.011
No, it's not in the want ads.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.430
And, honestIy, they don't have
the money for more peopIe.

51:40.514 --> 51:42.807
It's not more peopIe. It's you.

51:43.809 --> 51:46.352
You Iove stirring the shit.

51:47.480 --> 51:50.356
I am teIIing you something
you don't want to hear,

51:50.441 --> 51:53.318
and you are making this very painfuI for me.

51:53.402 --> 51:55.904
Megan Draperjust invited me to her party.

51:55.988 --> 51:59.616
At the very Iast minute.
Don't teII me that girI's not conniving.

51:59.700 --> 52:01.868
You think she wants you
around her husband?

52:04.663 --> 52:06.664
I'm going to Iie down.

52:07.500 --> 52:10.335
Sometimes Iife makes decisions for you.

52:23.682 --> 52:25.558
-Have a good day.
-Okay.

52:33.442 --> 52:34.901
I know your birthday was Iast week,

52:34.985 --> 52:37.612
and I was toId you don't ceIebrate it
and not to bring it up.

52:37.696 --> 52:39.823
Now I feeI Iike I got caught
with my pants down,

52:39.907 --> 52:42.200
so I got you a IittIe something.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.035
It's a pIant.

52:44.578 --> 52:46.704
I just wanted to say happy birthday.

52:46.789 --> 52:48.081
Kiss-ass.

52:49.667 --> 52:51.000
Thank you.

53:02.054 --> 53:05.473
I can get you some coffee,
but there's a partners' meeting.

53:05.724 --> 53:08.101
-Nobody's there.
-It's in Mr. CampbeII's office.

53:08.686 --> 53:11.479
-You want to smiIe?
-Is it your obituary?

53:11.564 --> 53:15.358
No, it's the IittIe saIt
we rubbed in Y&R's wound.

53:18.404 --> 53:20.154
It's beautifuI, no?

53:20.239 --> 53:22.740
-That's Mr. CampbeII.
-ShaII we?

53:28.247 --> 53:29.414
What?

53:30.040 --> 53:32.750
We don't make fun of
each other's wives here. Understood?

53:33.335 --> 53:36.588
Come on, I wasn't making fun of her.
I was making fun of you.

53:36.672 --> 53:38.089
-You're happy.
-I am.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.174
WeII, I want you to be happy.

53:40.259 --> 53:42.010
Somebody shouId be.

53:43.429 --> 53:45.847
You know, two weeks ago,

53:45.931 --> 53:48.057
Jane asked me, "Which one's MussoIini?"

53:50.060 --> 53:52.437
No, it's good. She's a great girI.

53:52.813 --> 53:55.940
They're aII great girIs.
At Ieast untiI they want something.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.319
Let's go.

54:00.195 --> 54:01.571
They're just Ieaving now.

54:01.655 --> 54:03.156
What, did they stop for a drink?

54:04.742 --> 54:07.702
WeII, why don't you get off your rear,
find them, and teII them I'm about...

54:07.786 --> 54:09.287
They're here.

54:12.124 --> 54:14.542
GentIemen, if you couId sIide over a bit.

54:14.627 --> 54:16.544
-A marveIous fete.
-Oh, yes.

54:16.629 --> 54:19.172
I have instructions from Trudy
to thank both of you.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.927
-Why are we meeting in here?
-Why are we here?

54:24.011 --> 54:26.554
PIease, don't smoke in here.
I spent the morning choking on the train.

54:33.395 --> 54:36.981
So, Mohawk is coming in.
I've brought them in.

54:37.066 --> 54:39.067
-What do you know about that?
-That's great news.

54:39.151 --> 54:41.402
-When?
-I don't know.

54:41.487 --> 54:43.780
AII I was thinking is that
I bring Henry and Jack in here

54:43.864 --> 54:47.200
to this very gathering of individuaIs,
but I have one question.

54:48.035 --> 54:49.494
Where are they going to sit?

54:50.454 --> 54:53.373
I mean, what kind of impression
does this space give you?

54:53.457 --> 54:55.500
Do you gaze upon
the cement coIumn and think,

54:55.584 --> 54:58.920
"Yes, I beIieve success for me
and my company dweIIs here."

55:00.005 --> 55:01.589
Why don't you take them
to the conference room?

55:01.674 --> 55:03.508
Because it's not that meeting.

55:03.592 --> 55:05.301
Fine, we'II have it in my office.

55:05.386 --> 55:07.679
This does not invoIve you, Roger.

55:07.972 --> 55:11.599
Nor does Vicks, PIaytex,
Life cereaI, Samsonite,

55:11.684 --> 55:13.977
Sugarberry Ham, Secor Laxative.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.020
Need I go on?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.231
What are you suggesting?

55:18.315 --> 55:21.526
He's suggesting
that you give him your office.

55:22.444 --> 55:24.487
-No, he's not.
-Yes, I am.

55:24.571 --> 55:26.072
WeII, forget it.

55:26.156 --> 55:27.907
Where am I supposed to conduct business?

55:27.992 --> 55:29.367
In the crapper, for aII I care.

55:29.451 --> 55:33.496
I'm a fuII partner and you're a junior,
so sorry, CharIie, but them's the breaks.

55:35.249 --> 55:38.292
GentIemen, I'm sure we can find
an equitabIe soIution to this.

55:38.377 --> 55:40.378
-There's no need for a row.
-You're right.

55:40.921 --> 55:42.130
I say we put it to a vote.

55:42.214 --> 55:44.048
I say we step outside.

55:51.724 --> 55:53.391
I didn't think so.

55:58.480 --> 55:59.814
Good work on Mohawk.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.774
Thank you, but I'm dead serious about this.

56:03.110 --> 56:05.236
I have too much responsibiIity
and too much business

56:05.320 --> 56:07.739
to appIy my skiIIs in this environment.

56:09.283 --> 56:10.908
You aII know it.

56:11.535 --> 56:13.202
We'II buy more space.

56:13.287 --> 56:16.456
-If we're handing out offices...
-AbsoIuteIy not.

56:16.749 --> 56:19.292
I can't extend our credit Iine any further.

56:19.376 --> 56:21.419
It'II work itseIf out.

56:23.172 --> 56:24.756
CongratuIations.

56:27.926 --> 56:29.844
When are they coming in?

56:29.928 --> 56:32.930
I'm stiII not sure they shouId,
considering the situation.

56:43.233 --> 56:44.859
Great party, Don.

56:45.277 --> 56:46.778
AbsoIuteIy.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.363
I couIdn't sIeep.

56:50.115 --> 56:52.366
Those tits and that mouth.

56:52.951 --> 56:54.619
She's such a sex kitten.

56:54.953 --> 56:57.371
That whoIe dance. How did he just sit there?

56:58.624 --> 57:00.833
You can't stand up
once you get in that condition.

57:00.959 --> 57:04.295
I wouId have. I wouId have just stood up
and grabbed her IittIe French behind

57:04.379 --> 57:06.547
and pushed her
through those cheap post-war waIIs.

57:06.632 --> 57:08.257
-Hi, Megan.
-Very funny.

57:08.342 --> 57:10.259
God, what I wouId do to her.

57:10.344 --> 57:12.303
Like what, for exampIe?

57:12.387 --> 57:13.429
I'II teII you what.

57:13.514 --> 57:15.848
I wouId Iove to see those heeIs
on my shouIder.

57:15.933 --> 57:19.018
"Je voudrais mas Harry."

57:19.103 --> 57:20.561
Good morning.

57:21.355 --> 57:22.605
Great party.

57:22.689 --> 57:25.149
ThriIIed to be incIuded.
Jennifer was very jeaIous.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.321
I think I'm gonna die.

57:31.824 --> 57:32.907
You couId have warned me.

57:32.991 --> 57:34.200
I did.

57:42.960 --> 57:45.086
l have the owner of the wallet
returning your call.

57:45.796 --> 57:47.130
Thank you.

57:48.340 --> 57:50.758
-HeIIo.
-Hello, Mr. Pryce.

57:50.843 --> 57:53.177
l'm calling for Alex Polito.

57:53.637 --> 57:57.181
-And who is this?
-This is his girl, Delores.

57:59.560 --> 58:02.770
WeII, when he comes into the office,

58:02.855 --> 58:04.856
I think I shouId speak with him personaIIy.

58:05.190 --> 58:07.441
l'm not his secretary. l'm his girl.

58:07.526 --> 58:10.027
l'm like his wife, but l can't call myself that.

58:14.074 --> 58:15.908
You don't sound happy about that.

58:15.993 --> 58:18.786
-Excuse me?
-I'm married myseIf.

58:18.871 --> 58:20.663
Good for you. What's her name?

58:20.747 --> 58:25.001
Rebecca. Rebecca Pryce. WeII, obviousIy.

58:25.210 --> 58:27.837
-That's a pretty name.
-I suppose so.

58:28.881 --> 58:30.381
She enjoys it.

58:31.633 --> 58:35.344
Do you think she's home right now,
lying in bed, talking to a stranger?

58:37.431 --> 58:39.056
I shouId hope not.

58:39.141 --> 58:41.851
So, you have Alex's wallet?

58:41.935 --> 58:44.187
Yes, I do.

58:44.271 --> 58:47.899
-And where are you?
-I'm at my offices in Midtown.

58:49.234 --> 58:50.818
Are you in big business?

58:50.903 --> 58:52.236
Excuse me?

58:52.738 --> 58:55.072
Are you in a big office building?

58:57.075 --> 58:58.618
Yes.

58:59.453 --> 59:04.916
That's why I don't have the Iuxury
of Iying around at 1 1 :00 in my underthings.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.919
l didn't tell you that part.

59:08.921 --> 59:11.589
You didn't say I was incorrect, either.

59:12.257 --> 59:13.966
Where the hell are you from?

59:14.051 --> 59:15.885
You sound like Cary Grant.

59:16.136 --> 59:18.346
I toId you, Midtown.

59:19.932 --> 59:21.432
Why don't I...

59:22.184 --> 59:26.771
Listen, I reaIIy shouId return this,
you know, the waIIet.

59:27.356 --> 59:29.774
I couId sIip it in the post or...

59:30.067 --> 59:32.985
Of course, you know,
that has its disadvantages.

59:33.111 --> 59:34.946
There's a bit of cash here.

59:35.072 --> 59:37.114
Or I couId hand-deIiver it.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.618
Is this a current address?

59:45.791 --> 59:47.250
l don't know.

59:47.542 --> 59:50.127
l don't know if that would be proper.

59:52.256 --> 59:53.756
No, of course.

59:54.925 --> 59:57.927
Why don't you meet me
at my pIace of business?

59:58.095 --> 1:00:01.639
I'II give you the address
or have my secretary heIp you.

1:00:03.392 --> 1:00:05.643
Yeah. Why don't we do that?

1:00:05.852 --> 1:00:07.561
And l'll come by when l can.

1:00:07.646 --> 1:00:11.649
WeII, I'II be here the rest of my Iife.

1:00:14.444 --> 1:00:15.903
Just a minute.

1:00:19.157 --> 1:00:20.783
I Iook forward to it.

1:00:20.867 --> 1:00:22.118
Why not?

1:00:22.744 --> 1:00:24.078
ToodIe-oo.

1:00:24.162 --> 1:00:25.579
That's cute.

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:32.503
ScarIett, wouId you give this woman
directions to our office?

1:00:32.587 --> 1:00:34.338
She's on Iine three.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:59.280
Mr. Crane, Mr. Sterling
has requested you in his office.

1:01:00.324 --> 1:01:02.033
Is there a meeting?

1:01:03.368 --> 1:01:07.163
He just came over here, said
he needed to see you, and walked away.

1:01:07.247 --> 1:01:09.915
-Why didn't he come in?
-l don't know.

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.834
He knows you're in there.

1:01:11.918 --> 1:01:15.338
Okay. Okay.
Did you see him taIking to Megan or Don?

1:01:15.422 --> 1:01:16.756
l've been working.

1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:18.883
-What did you do?
-Nothing!

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:34.607
You wanted to see me?

1:01:34.858 --> 1:01:37.401
I did. Come in, have a seat.

1:01:38.653 --> 1:01:40.446
No, that's okay.

1:01:40.530 --> 1:01:42.406
I think you shouId have a seat.

1:01:43.909 --> 1:01:45.117
Okay.

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:50.331
Now,

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:54.293
I think you know that we Iike to
think of this pIace as a famiIy.

1:01:54.378 --> 1:01:57.254
And there are certain ways a famiIy behaves.

1:01:57.714 --> 1:02:00.132
What did she say?
You have to hear my side of it.

1:02:01.093 --> 1:02:02.426
Your side of what?

1:02:02.511 --> 1:02:04.303
What... Nothing.

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:06.097
You're aIways up to something,
aren't you, Crane?

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:10.726
It was an honest mistake
and I consider myseIf reprimanded.

1:02:10.811 --> 1:02:11.977
Great.

1:02:12.562 --> 1:02:14.772
I was thinking Pete couId take your office.

1:02:15.190 --> 1:02:16.399
ReaIIy?

1:02:16.775 --> 1:02:19.360
Look, I wiII apoIogize face to face,

1:02:19.444 --> 1:02:21.654
as horribIe as that wiII be,
but I think you're...

1:02:22.364 --> 1:02:23.948
There's no reason to Iet me go.

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:27.618
You're not getting fired.

1:02:28.995 --> 1:02:30.287
And what the heII did you do?

1:02:31.498 --> 1:02:33.541
I made fun of Zou Bisou.

1:02:34.167 --> 1:02:35.459
So did I.

1:02:36.545 --> 1:02:38.295
Is that a crime? No.

1:02:38.922 --> 1:02:41.674
I tried to get Jane to taIk to me
in that accent. Nothing doing.

1:02:41.800 --> 1:02:43.884
She doesn't speak French.
She doesn't Iike me.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:47.346
I went home after and
Jennifer didn't know what was coming.

1:02:47.431 --> 1:02:49.014
-I was Iike...
-I don't want to hear that.

1:02:49.516 --> 1:02:52.017
No, of course you don't. Why wouId you?

1:02:52.394 --> 1:02:56.105
Look, I think you can understand
that Pete needs a bigger office.

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:59.108
And just between you, me,
and the window washer,

1:02:59.192 --> 1:03:01.318
it's been decided that you shouId trade.

1:03:02.988 --> 1:03:04.989
-Who decided that?
-I did.

1:03:06.491 --> 1:03:09.160
I can't do that.
And I don't know that I have to do it.

1:03:10.162 --> 1:03:11.370
Do I?

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:16.584
Harry.

1:03:17.252 --> 1:03:19.962
I'm asking you as a friend.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:24.091
And I appreciate that, Roger, I reaIIy do,
but I need my office.

1:03:24.176 --> 1:03:26.677
Look, first of aII,
Pete's office isn't that different.

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:28.429
-I disagree.
-Fine.

1:03:28.972 --> 1:03:32.141
Name the most important person
you couId bring into this office.

1:03:33.685 --> 1:03:35.186
WiIIiam PaIey.

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:37.855
Okay, so you shouIdn't do that.

1:03:38.398 --> 1:03:42.109
Trust me, network and studio executives
want to think you're out there jet-setting,

1:03:42.194 --> 1:03:46.155
rubbing shouIders with teIevision stars
and chorus girIs.

1:03:46.239 --> 1:03:48.782
You shouId be taIking to cIients ringside

1:03:48.867 --> 1:03:52.745
or at a three-star restaurant,
not coming into your miserabIe IittIe office.

1:03:53.038 --> 1:03:55.039
But I do. I come in here aImost every day.

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:57.958
And Pete's office is a shithoIe
with a support beam.

1:03:59.419 --> 1:04:02.004
What if I were to make it worth your whiIe?

1:04:02.088 --> 1:04:03.714
I'm aIready head of my department.

1:04:03.798 --> 1:04:06.300
What wouId be an appropriate bonus?

1:04:06.468 --> 1:04:08.511
There's no bonuses. We have no money.

1:04:08.595 --> 1:04:10.429
How much wouId it take?

1:04:10.514 --> 1:04:12.681
WeII, first of aII,
it's more than you couId have on you.

1:04:12.766 --> 1:04:14.058
ReaIIy?

1:04:17.604 --> 1:04:19.104
That's $1 ,1 00.

1:04:19.564 --> 1:04:21.315
Why do you carry so much cash?

1:04:21.399 --> 1:04:23.567
It's more than 1 ,000, Harry.

1:04:26.530 --> 1:04:31.242
That is a month's saIary after taxes.

1:04:35.830 --> 1:04:37.456
There's no window in there.

1:04:37.541 --> 1:04:40.834
You couId buy yourseIf a very beautifuI
picture of something to Iook at.

1:04:45.590 --> 1:04:48.384
WeII, okay. But you're gonna owe me.

1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:51.554
No, I'm not. I just gave you a Iot of money.

1:04:51.638 --> 1:04:54.348
This is a transaction. And if you don't Iike it,

1:04:54.432 --> 1:04:57.268
we can have the conversation
you thought we were having.

1:04:58.603 --> 1:05:01.272
-So this is every month?
-Get the heII out of my office.

1:05:29.467 --> 1:05:31.510
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1:05:31.761 --> 1:05:33.220
I'm Joan.

1:05:33.305 --> 1:05:35.598
I'm Meredith. Can I heIp you?

1:05:36.266 --> 1:05:37.558
Joan Harris.

1:05:39.144 --> 1:05:40.519
I work here.

1:05:40.729 --> 1:05:42.688
Worked here. I've been on Ieave.

1:05:45.734 --> 1:05:48.402
Joan. My goodness.

1:05:49.154 --> 1:05:51.155
It's hard to beIieve you just had a baby.

1:05:51.906 --> 1:05:53.824
You don't know where I started.

1:05:53.992 --> 1:05:55.242
Do you want me to announce you?

1:05:55.327 --> 1:05:56.869
No, I'II Iet myseIf in.

1:05:56.953 --> 1:05:58.412
Are you sure?

1:05:58.538 --> 1:06:00.414
No one mentioned a new girI.

1:06:00.999 --> 1:06:05.461
I guess they needed someone up here
because ScarIett is now covering Mr. Pryce

1:06:05.545 --> 1:06:07.630
so that she can do the books with CIara.

1:06:09.674 --> 1:06:12.426
WeII, now I can understand
why I wasn't toId.

1:06:12.510 --> 1:06:15.137
Oh, my God. My mouth.

1:06:15.597 --> 1:06:17.598
CouId you just heIp me with the door?

1:06:20.310 --> 1:06:21.810
He's adorabIe.

1:06:23.313 --> 1:06:26.106
PIease don't be mad at me
for teIIing you that.

1:06:26.191 --> 1:06:28.776
I'm very happy being nobody here.

1:06:29.819 --> 1:06:32.946
I know a girI who had yourjob
who ended up with everything.

1:06:36.326 --> 1:06:38.285
Where wouId you Iike to visit first?

1:06:38.370 --> 1:06:40.120
I suppose my office.

1:06:40.205 --> 1:06:42.623
Yes, yes, absoIuteIy. Joan.

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:45.918
My goodness, you Iook radiant.

1:06:46.378 --> 1:06:48.921
-Can I see him?
-I don't see why not.

1:06:49.381 --> 1:06:51.965
-Where's ScarIett?
-Go fetch CaroIine.

1:06:52.842 --> 1:06:54.093
Joanie.

1:06:55.053 --> 1:06:57.596
Look at you out and about.

1:06:57.681 --> 1:06:59.473
Yes, we're gonna stop by The Copa Iater.

1:06:59.557 --> 1:07:01.767
One of us badIy needs a drink.

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:05.312
Lane made it very cIear
we're not hiring anybody.

1:07:05.397 --> 1:07:08.023
I don't care how buxom his mother is.

1:07:08.733 --> 1:07:09.775
Don.

1:07:10.694 --> 1:07:13.028
-Look at that.
-He's okay.

1:07:18.576 --> 1:07:19.952
HeIIo, Megan.

1:07:21.913 --> 1:07:23.414
HeIIo, Joan.

1:07:27.001 --> 1:07:29.586
I'm sure I'm not ruining
any surprises at this point,

1:07:29.671 --> 1:07:31.964
but how was your party?
I'm sorry I missed it.

1:07:33.341 --> 1:07:34.717
He's adorabIe.

1:07:35.176 --> 1:07:36.593
Are we weIcoming you back?

1:07:36.678 --> 1:07:39.012
-That was my impression.
-Today?

1:07:39.097 --> 1:07:41.432
-Do you want to hoId him?
-What?

1:07:47.439 --> 1:07:49.565
He's a IittIe cabbage.

1:07:51.901 --> 1:07:55.154
It's just a matter of time, Don.

1:07:55.613 --> 1:07:58.031
I shouId be getting back to work.

1:08:01.911 --> 1:08:03.829
I'm gonna quit whiIe I'm ahead.

1:08:03.913 --> 1:08:05.748
Joanie, I'II say what I said
when you Ieft here,

1:08:05.832 --> 1:08:07.708
this is not a good excuse.

1:08:07.792 --> 1:08:09.418
Nice to see you.

1:08:10.336 --> 1:08:12.671
-When are you coming back?
-I was pIanning on three weeks.

1:08:12.756 --> 1:08:15.591
My mother's Ieaving any day,
so I was gonna hire a girI.

1:08:15.675 --> 1:08:18.218
It's gonna be terribIe to Ieave him.

1:08:18.762 --> 1:08:19.928
Joan.

1:08:22.140 --> 1:08:24.308
I was wondering if you were going to visit.

1:08:26.019 --> 1:08:27.936
My hands are dirty.

1:08:28.313 --> 1:08:30.481
Oh, my God. He Iooks just Iike you.

1:08:30.565 --> 1:08:33.567
I shouId get back to work.
I have more than ever, thanks to you, Joan.

1:08:33.651 --> 1:08:34.818
Good.

1:08:37.947 --> 1:08:39.865
So, how are you?

1:08:39.991 --> 1:08:41.241
WeII, weII, weII.

1:08:41.993 --> 1:08:43.619
There's my baby.

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:46.330
Now move that brat out of the way
so I can see her.

1:08:46.414 --> 1:08:47.873
HeIIo, Roger.

1:08:48.458 --> 1:08:50.542
LittIe dud Iike my present?

1:08:50.627 --> 1:08:54.171
I'm sure you're aware
that a bicycIe's not usefuI yet, UncIe Roger.

1:08:54.255 --> 1:08:56.048
Oh, no? He's a Ioafer?

1:08:57.008 --> 1:09:00.427
He's been keeping me awake.
He needs constant attention.

1:09:00.512 --> 1:09:02.763
Is that right? Let me see that.

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:11.355
Has anyone even seen this baby
with you waIking next to him?

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:14.817
Scarlett. Scarlett, may l see you?

1:09:14.901 --> 1:09:16.193
I got it.

1:09:19.030 --> 1:09:22.115
Mr. Pryce, Mrs. Harris is here to see you.

1:09:23.868 --> 1:09:25.786
-Send her in.
-I've got him.

1:09:25.870 --> 1:09:28.705
CaroIine, I need you to
make dinner reservations right away.

1:09:30.708 --> 1:09:32.459
I'II be right back.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:40.801
This reaIIy is an unexpected pIeasure.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:42.553
Just stopping by.

1:09:44.013 --> 1:09:45.931
Anything I shouId know about?

1:09:46.599 --> 1:09:49.560
Yes, actuaIIy. Pressing business.

1:09:52.146 --> 1:09:53.689
WouId you mind?

1:09:54.065 --> 1:09:56.441
No, not at aII.

1:10:01.322 --> 1:10:03.866
What are we supposed to do with him?

1:10:04.492 --> 1:10:06.702
Better than the steps of a church, I guess.

1:10:09.247 --> 1:10:11.498
Have either of you seen CIara?

1:10:11.666 --> 1:10:12.708
No.

1:10:13.793 --> 1:10:15.127
What's that?

1:10:15.253 --> 1:10:17.337
It's Joan's IittIe boy.

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:23.510
That's darIing.

1:10:23.595 --> 1:10:25.345
WouId you pIease take him
and give him back to Joan?

1:10:25.430 --> 1:10:28.265
Do I suddenIy appear to be wearing a skirt?

1:10:28.933 --> 1:10:30.601
SpectacuIar party.

1:10:31.477 --> 1:10:34.771
Just take him.
You shouId say heIIo to Joan anyways.

1:10:41.863 --> 1:10:43.113
CIara?

1:10:44.741 --> 1:10:45.866
She Iooks very good.

1:10:45.950 --> 1:10:48.577
She does. She Iooked good at nine months.

1:10:49.537 --> 1:10:51.496
I don't know about that.

1:10:53.082 --> 1:10:54.625
I'm surprised you didn't teII her.

1:10:54.709 --> 1:10:57.502
-TeII her what?
-That she Iooked terribIe.

1:10:57.712 --> 1:11:00.422
You seem to say whatever's on your mind.

1:11:00.757 --> 1:11:02.466
Is something wrong?

1:11:03.927 --> 1:11:05.052
No.

1:11:05.970 --> 1:11:08.931
I got the Vicks coupons done.

1:11:09.223 --> 1:11:12.184
I know you thought you were
the onIy one working this weekend.

1:11:13.311 --> 1:11:14.978
No, I didn't.

1:11:15.063 --> 1:11:17.564
ReaIIy? That's what you said to Don.

1:11:20.443 --> 1:11:23.570
I know. I had too much to drink and...

1:11:23.655 --> 1:11:26.031
And you couIdn't resist
saying something obnoxious?

1:11:26.908 --> 1:11:31.328
WeII, just so we're cIear,
I put in a Iot of work on Heinz. So did you.

1:11:31.412 --> 1:11:34.331
You can't even apoIogize. None of you can.

1:11:36.501 --> 1:11:39.086
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:42.422
What is wrong with you peopIe?

1:11:42.507 --> 1:11:46.093
You're aII so cynicaI. You don't smiIe.
You smirk.

1:11:46.177 --> 1:11:47.761
Is he mad at me?

1:11:48.012 --> 1:11:49.429
I don't care.

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:52.015
Who wouIdn't want a surprise party?

1:11:55.478 --> 1:11:57.145
I don't feeI weII.

1:11:59.899 --> 1:12:01.108
Megan...

1:12:01.192 --> 1:12:03.902
No, reaIIy, I don't feeI weII.

1:12:07.407 --> 1:12:09.324
Am I aIIowed to go home?

1:12:10.576 --> 1:12:11.910
Of course.

1:12:14.622 --> 1:12:16.748
I'm so sorry. You were right.

1:12:17.375 --> 1:12:18.750
I apoIogize.

1:12:20.962 --> 1:12:22.295
It's fine.

1:12:33.224 --> 1:12:35.517
Heinz won't sign off on the work.

1:12:35.601 --> 1:12:37.644
So they won't be back in for 30 days,

1:12:37.729 --> 1:12:40.439
which means we won't get paid
for another 90.

1:12:40.523 --> 1:12:43.775
And we're about to shoot Christmas ads
for Sugarberry and Vicks.

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:45.986
But they won't run untiI Christmas,

1:12:46.070 --> 1:12:48.530
so we won't get paid untiI Easter.

1:12:48.948 --> 1:12:51.825
WeII, that expIains why
you're asking me for aII this free advice.

1:12:52.744 --> 1:12:54.494
I'm just trying to get things in order.

1:12:54.579 --> 1:12:56.371
So that you can eIiminate my job?

1:12:56.456 --> 1:12:58.331
What? AbsoIuteIy not.

1:12:58.416 --> 1:13:01.251
-Then why did you run an ad?
-What ad?

1:13:01.419 --> 1:13:04.379
-In this morning's Times.
-Oh, that.

1:13:05.214 --> 1:13:06.590
That wasn't an ad.

1:13:06.674 --> 1:13:08.633
WeII, what the heII was it, then?

1:13:08.718 --> 1:13:12.095
It was some private barb directed at Y&R.

1:13:16.142 --> 1:13:19.644
Mrs. Harris, the books have
practicaIIy been heId together

1:13:19.729 --> 1:13:21.688
with spit in your absence.

1:13:23.900 --> 1:13:26.359
What about ScarIett and CIara
spIitting my work?

1:13:26.444 --> 1:13:27.569
SpIitting?

1:13:27.653 --> 1:13:31.531
The two of them together couIdn't operate
a parking meter. They're imbeciIes.

1:13:34.452 --> 1:13:36.870
WeII, that was a dumb thing to do.

1:13:37.955 --> 1:13:40.207
Oh, there, there.

1:13:42.627 --> 1:13:44.544
I'm sorry.

1:13:46.297 --> 1:13:48.757
I've been Iike this since the baby.

1:13:49.300 --> 1:13:50.926
And it's not him.

1:13:52.303 --> 1:13:53.553
I just

1:13:54.722 --> 1:13:58.809
keep thinking about what's going on here,
and I missed it too much.

1:13:59.477 --> 1:14:00.852
It's too embarrassing.

1:14:00.937 --> 1:14:02.646
Nothing's happened.

1:14:03.022 --> 1:14:06.233
Something aIways happens.
Things are different.

1:14:06.984 --> 1:14:09.736
Somebody teIIs a joke and
you don't know what they're taIking about.

1:14:09.821 --> 1:14:13.240
There have been no jokes, not without you.

1:14:13.449 --> 1:14:14.908
Not even at my expense?

1:14:14.992 --> 1:14:17.327
I'm terribIy adrift without you.

1:14:18.329 --> 1:14:21.665
It's just a matter of time
before they find out I'm a sham.

1:14:24.335 --> 1:14:26.336
Nobody came to visit me.

1:14:27.004 --> 1:14:31.675
They sent fIowers with some stupid card
written by the fIorist.

1:14:32.677 --> 1:14:35.554
There wouId have been a cake,
but you weren't here to arrange it.

1:14:39.517 --> 1:14:40.892
It's just...

1:14:43.312 --> 1:14:46.106
And I don't expect you to understand this,

1:14:48.192 --> 1:14:50.569
but my husband's been gone so Iong.

1:14:50.653 --> 1:14:53.029
And I know he's coming home soon.

1:14:55.867 --> 1:14:58.577
And even with my baby there
and my mother,

1:15:00.288 --> 1:15:01.746
I feeI aIone.

1:15:03.791 --> 1:15:06.334
It's home, but it's not everything.

1:15:07.545 --> 1:15:09.212
I do understand.

1:15:12.425 --> 1:15:17.095
Now, I won't have everyone thinking
I've made you cry.

1:15:22.727 --> 1:15:24.686
WeII, at Ieast teII me about the party.

1:15:24.770 --> 1:15:27.439
Mrs. Draper put on a bit of a burIesque.

1:15:27.523 --> 1:15:29.649
-No.
-Oh, yes.

1:15:29.734 --> 1:15:32.611
She danced and sang in front of aII of us.

1:15:33.738 --> 1:15:35.739
She was quite the coquette.

1:15:42.163 --> 1:15:43.955
I can't do it justice.

1:15:45.208 --> 1:15:46.499
And Don?

1:15:47.293 --> 1:15:50.086
I saw his souI Ieave his body.

1:15:51.214 --> 1:15:54.925
I can't even imagine how handsome
that man must be bIushing.

1:15:56.802 --> 1:15:57.928
Yes.

1:16:06.604 --> 1:16:09.481
I don't know how I ended up with him, but...

1:16:10.191 --> 1:16:11.942
Thank you so much.

1:16:16.322 --> 1:16:18.448
Mr. Pryce, I wiII be speaking with you.

1:16:18.532 --> 1:16:20.951
Let me take a Iook at him at Ieast.

1:16:27.250 --> 1:16:29.334
Handsome IittIe bIagger.

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:39.678
Have you seen CIara?

1:16:40.096 --> 1:16:42.681
CongratuIations. We're gonna be
right next to each other finaIIy.

1:16:43.975 --> 1:16:45.016
What's going on?

1:16:45.101 --> 1:16:46.726
CIara, couId you excuse us?

1:16:46.811 --> 1:16:48.728
WeII, she obviousIy aIready knows.

1:16:48.813 --> 1:16:50.021
PIease.

1:16:52.817 --> 1:16:54.901
Roger, you know, convinced me.

1:16:54.986 --> 1:16:57.529
We aII thought it was best for the firm
that you have a bigger office,

1:16:57.613 --> 1:16:59.614
so I was asked to switch.

1:17:00.157 --> 1:17:01.908
I'II be right back.

1:17:05.830 --> 1:17:09.958
I appreciate your sacrifice,
but a bigger office was not the point.

1:17:10.126 --> 1:17:12.127
WeII, fine, then. I'II switch back.

1:17:12.461 --> 1:17:13.920
Roger didn't say I couIdn't switch back.

1:17:14.005 --> 1:17:16.256
I don't care what Roger says.
I am the head of accounts.

1:17:16.340 --> 1:17:19.592
I am bringing in aII the business.
I deserve the bigger office.

1:17:19.677 --> 1:17:21.720
It's a great office, Pete.

1:17:22.638 --> 1:17:24.389
It's very important.

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.766
It's got the windows.
God, I'm gonna miss them.

1:17:26.851 --> 1:17:29.269
And you did this
because Roger toId you to?

1:17:29.353 --> 1:17:31.313
And aIso because I respect you so much.

1:17:31.397 --> 1:17:32.939
What do you want me to say?

1:17:33.024 --> 1:17:35.525
Look, I just need a pIace to hide
untiI Megan Ieaves.

1:17:37.069 --> 1:17:39.029
Oh, God, unIess she toId Don.

1:17:39.196 --> 1:17:41.614
She's not gonna teII Don, is she?

1:17:43.743 --> 1:17:45.618
I don't know what you're taIking about.

1:17:49.957 --> 1:17:51.207
Come in.

1:17:58.549 --> 1:17:59.883
What's up?

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:05.472
At your party, which was IoveIy,

1:18:05.556 --> 1:18:07.390
I said something
which I shouIdn't have said,

1:18:07.475 --> 1:18:12.020
and I want to apoIogize
if you had a bad time because of it.

1:18:12.271 --> 1:18:13.938
I had a wonderfuI time.

1:18:14.899 --> 1:18:16.232
WeII, good.

1:18:17.068 --> 1:18:20.487
The onIy reason I'm bringing it up
is Megan seemed kind of upset.

1:18:23.908 --> 1:18:25.450
I'm very sorry.

1:18:25.534 --> 1:18:27.660
I shouId not be aIIowed to drink
at work functions.

1:18:27.745 --> 1:18:29.454
Or at aII, honestIy.

1:18:29.538 --> 1:18:31.206
-What did she say?
-Nothing.

1:18:31.290 --> 1:18:33.833
But she went home. She wasn't feeIing weII.

1:18:35.836 --> 1:18:37.796
I'm mortified if I had something to do with it.

1:18:37.922 --> 1:18:39.381
When did she Ieave?

1:18:39.590 --> 1:18:40.965
I think she wants to be aIone.

1:18:41.050 --> 1:18:43.093
You don't know her at aII.

1:18:44.387 --> 1:18:45.637
CaroIine.

1:18:46.138 --> 1:18:47.931
I'm done for the day.

1:18:54.939 --> 1:18:56.272
Mr. Pryce.

1:19:01.904 --> 1:19:03.113
Yes, ScarIett?

1:19:03.197 --> 1:19:06.783
There's a gentleman here,
the owner of the wallet, Mr. Polito.

1:19:06.867 --> 1:19:09.119
He's in reception. Shall l bring him back?

1:19:09.453 --> 1:19:11.621
No, absoIuteIy not.

1:19:12.123 --> 1:19:13.873
Well, do you want to see him?

1:19:14.208 --> 1:19:16.960
Yes, I'II be out in a moment.

1:19:17.128 --> 1:19:18.920
Of course, Mr. Pryce.

1:19:19.588 --> 1:19:20.713
Thank you, DeIores.

1:19:21.048 --> 1:19:23.591
-Excuse me?
-I said... Just a minute.

1:19:41.819 --> 1:19:42.986
HeIIo.

1:19:44.155 --> 1:19:45.822
Are you Mr. PoIito?

1:19:45.906 --> 1:19:48.825
I am. AIthough there's no way
for you to know that.

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:51.161
You got my waIIet.

1:19:51.412 --> 1:19:52.996
I contacted you.

1:19:54.248 --> 1:19:55.582
Thank you.

1:19:55.791 --> 1:19:57.500
WeII, I'm gIad this worked out.

1:19:57.585 --> 1:19:58.877
HoId on.

1:19:58.961 --> 1:20:00.837
Just hoId on a second.

1:20:07.178 --> 1:20:08.928
Everything's there.

1:20:16.979 --> 1:20:18.229
So it is.

1:20:21.942 --> 1:20:23.943
WeII, you can't bIame me.

1:20:24.195 --> 1:20:26.779
My horse came in and then I Iost my waIIet.

1:20:26.864 --> 1:20:28.490
Then it came in again.

1:20:30.910 --> 1:20:33.203
No, that's not necessary.

1:20:33.329 --> 1:20:36.581
-You've got to take a reward.
-I couIdn't possibIy.

1:20:39.919 --> 1:20:41.377
My girI said you were reaI poIite.

1:20:43.547 --> 1:20:46.216
ObviousIy from the accent,
you're not from around here.

1:20:46.550 --> 1:20:48.551
No, I'm not.

1:20:52.932 --> 1:20:55.183
This is the way we do things.

1:20:57.978 --> 1:21:00.188
Thanks again. I mean it.

1:21:01.482 --> 1:21:02.565
You're a reaI gentIeman.

1:21:21.669 --> 1:21:23.670
Megan? Where are you?

1:21:27.550 --> 1:21:29.092
You're home.

1:21:29.176 --> 1:21:31.219
So are you. What happened?

1:21:31.845 --> 1:21:33.096
Nothing.

1:21:33.931 --> 1:21:35.640
You just Ieft without me?

1:21:35.724 --> 1:21:37.809
-I was upset.
-That's cIear.

1:21:38.435 --> 1:21:39.769
About what?

1:21:40.104 --> 1:21:42.438
Because my apartment is fiIthy.

1:21:43.232 --> 1:21:44.857
Where's the girI?

1:21:45.109 --> 1:21:46.693
I sent her home.

1:21:56.120 --> 1:21:57.829
What are you doing?

1:21:58.706 --> 1:22:00.748
I'm cIeaning up. I don't want to get sweaty.

1:22:01.458 --> 1:22:04.168
-Like that?
-Don't you Iook at me.

1:22:04.962 --> 1:22:06.754
I'm taIking to you.

1:22:08.299 --> 1:22:09.924
I'm cIeaning up.

1:22:10.384 --> 1:22:11.593
ReaIIy?

1:22:12.136 --> 1:22:14.971
Stop Iooking at me.
You aren't aIIowed to Iook at me.

1:22:15.180 --> 1:22:16.764
Then put some cIothes on.

1:22:16.849 --> 1:22:19.934
I said stop it. You don't deserve it.

1:22:20.311 --> 1:22:21.519
Come on.

1:22:21.979 --> 1:22:25.315
You don't Iike presents.
You don't Iike nice things.

1:22:34.199 --> 1:22:36.826
Besides, you're too oId.

1:22:37.161 --> 1:22:38.745
I don't need an oId person.

1:22:38.829 --> 1:22:40.955
You probabIy couIdn't do it anyway.

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:42.206
Don't!

1:22:43.167 --> 1:22:44.876
-Get up.
-No.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.753
I don't want peopIe to think
you're getting this.

1:22:47.880 --> 1:22:49.005
You want it so badIy.

1:22:49.089 --> 1:22:51.549
I don't want it. I don't want you.

1:22:52.926 --> 1:22:55.762
You don't get to have this. Go sit over there.

1:22:55.846 --> 1:22:57.847
AII you get to do is watch.

1:23:25.876 --> 1:23:27.377
Where's Harry?

1:23:27.836 --> 1:23:29.170
Who cares?

1:23:29.797 --> 1:23:32.298
I'm sorry. Do you need to see Mr. CampbeII?

1:23:32.383 --> 1:23:33.466
No.

1:23:36.136 --> 1:23:37.929
Is Roger SterIing stiII here?

1:23:38.013 --> 1:23:39.055
Yes.

1:23:39.390 --> 1:23:41.766
I want you to Iet him do whatever he wants.

1:23:41.850 --> 1:23:43.726
And I want you to penciI in
an appointment tomorrow

1:23:43.811 --> 1:23:47.230
at the coffee shop in the ferry buiIding
in Staten IsIand.

1:23:47.398 --> 1:23:48.606
6:00 a.m.

1:23:48.982 --> 1:23:51.693
With Coca-CoIa.

1:23:52.903 --> 1:23:54.070
Okay.

1:23:56.573 --> 1:23:58.074
That'II be aII.

1:24:23.183 --> 1:24:25.685
I don't think those peopIe Iike me.

1:24:27.062 --> 1:24:28.646
That's not true.

1:24:30.023 --> 1:24:33.151
WeII, I'm not sure I Iike them.

1:24:39.283 --> 1:24:42.535
The reason I didn't want
you to have that party is

1:24:42.870 --> 1:24:45.163
I didn't want them in our home.

1:24:46.498 --> 1:24:50.126
You've onIy been in the creative end
of this business for three months.

1:24:50.419 --> 1:24:53.713
And being a secretary,
you don't know what goes on.

1:24:53.881 --> 1:24:57.967
There isn't one probIem that Peggy
or anybody in that office has

1:24:58.343 --> 1:25:00.553
that wasn't there before you.

1:25:05.601 --> 1:25:07.685
You think you're a spIinter?

1:25:07.811 --> 1:25:09.187
You're not.

1:25:10.272 --> 1:25:13.107
The whoIe foot's been infected for years.

1:25:17.571 --> 1:25:20.114
I Iove going to work with you because

1:25:21.366 --> 1:25:23.910
you Iove work and you Iove me.

1:25:23.994 --> 1:25:28.748
But I wonder if maybe it's not a good idea.

1:25:32.377 --> 1:25:34.670
I don't reaIIy care about work.

1:25:35.297 --> 1:25:37.006
I want you at work

1:25:37.090 --> 1:25:38.841
because I want you.

1:25:50.062 --> 1:25:52.605
I think we have to repIace the rug.

1:25:55.859 --> 1:25:58.945
Just because you see white carpet
in a magazine doesn't mean it's practicaI.

1:25:59.029 --> 1:26:00.112
It's beautifuI.

1:26:00.197 --> 1:26:03.533
WeII, I've taken a Iot of pictures
of white carpets.

1:26:04.785 --> 1:26:07.119
You have to have four or five on hand.

1:26:08.872 --> 1:26:10.832
I thought you wanted it.

1:26:12.543 --> 1:26:15.253
I just wanted you to have what you want.

1:26:54.418 --> 1:26:55.751
What are you doing?

1:26:55.836 --> 1:26:58.087
I've got to go to Staten IsIand.

1:26:58.171 --> 1:27:00.256
-What time is it?
-Shut up.

1:27:04.928 --> 1:27:06.596
An aboveground pooI?

1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:09.140
No, no, in the ground. With deck chairs.

1:27:09.516 --> 1:27:12.602
That costs a fortune.
You gonna dig it yourseIf?

1:27:12.936 --> 1:27:14.770
We'II see what happens at Christmas.

1:27:14.855 --> 1:27:16.856
I never count on a bonus.

1:27:17.691 --> 1:27:19.609
I'm not taIking to you.

1:27:20.485 --> 1:27:22.612
I hope to be dead by Christmas.

1:27:31.038 --> 1:27:33.080
Do you have any money for the grocer?

1:27:33.165 --> 1:27:34.832
You toId me not to write any checks.

1:27:34.917 --> 1:27:36.417
No, of course.

1:27:58.023 --> 1:28:00.149
He's finaIIy gone to sIeep.

1:28:38.230 --> 1:28:40.815
We cannot caII security. They are appIicants.

1:28:42.776 --> 1:28:44.193
What's going on out there?

1:28:44.903 --> 1:28:48.239
They're aII here responding
to your hiIarious advertisement.

1:28:52.119 --> 1:28:54.870
Is it just me, or is the Iobby fuII of negroes?

1:28:54.955 --> 1:28:56.539
They saw the Y&R ad.

1:28:57.249 --> 1:28:59.375
The humor was Iost on them.

1:28:59.459 --> 1:29:02.128
-Not on me.
-It was a chiIdish prank.

1:29:02.212 --> 1:29:04.463
Because you're above that, right?

1:29:04.548 --> 1:29:05.840
What are we gonna do?

1:29:05.924 --> 1:29:07.800
WouId you Ieave us be, dear?

1:29:09.302 --> 1:29:11.012
TeII them the position's been fiIIed.

1:29:11.096 --> 1:29:14.306
There's the possibiIity
that we couId be the subject of a protest.

1:29:14.391 --> 1:29:16.434
Then we interview them. Forever.
They'II go away.

1:29:16.518 --> 1:29:18.644
That is not a soIution.

1:29:18.729 --> 1:29:20.396
And who's to say
there's not a reporter out there?

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:21.814
I don't know why we can't just hire one.

1:29:21.898 --> 1:29:24.275
Because we're not hiring anyone.

1:29:24.359 --> 1:29:25.735
Just fire that receptionist.

1:29:25.819 --> 1:29:27.611
We can't have one out there.

1:29:33.452 --> 1:29:36.412
-What is that?
-It's from Young & Rubicam.

1:29:39.124 --> 1:29:40.624
It's a resume.

1:29:41.043 --> 1:29:43.210
"1 960 to '65,

1:29:43.295 --> 1:29:45.463
"toted dat barge, Iifted dat baIe."

1:29:47.507 --> 1:29:49.842
Did those peopIe out there

1:29:49.926 --> 1:29:52.428
see that artifact come in here?

1:29:52.804 --> 1:29:55.347
Yes. I'm positive.

1:30:06.943 --> 1:30:08.277
Good morning.

1:30:08.361 --> 1:30:10.404
I'd Iike to thank you aII for coming.

1:30:11.073 --> 1:30:14.033
First of aII,
we're onIy Iooking for secretaries.

1:30:14.117 --> 1:30:16.619
So, gentIemen, you are free to Ieave.

1:30:16.703 --> 1:30:19.038
I mean, you are weIcome to Ieave.

1:30:19.122 --> 1:30:21.624
I mean, you may go.

1:30:25.462 --> 1:30:27.379

1:30:27.464 --> 1:30:30.007
