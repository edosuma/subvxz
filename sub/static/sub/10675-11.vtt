just emailed me.
She's coming to visit.

00:43.584 --> 00:46.757
Wait. Aliens have email?

00:46.757 --> 00:49.470
Of course. I get
so much spam from there.

00:49.470 --> 00:51.722
I mean, who really thinks
a Calderan prince

as an alien anymore.
- Aw, really?

01:08.859 --> 01:11.192
Yeah. To me, you're just
a totally normal girl

best friend or your twin sister?

06:29.269 --> 06:31.472

return home.

06:31.472 --> 06:34.775
But don't worry.
I know what to do.

06:40.521 --> 06:44.024

06:47.578 --> 06:49.490

06:49.490 --> 06:52.453
Well, her real name is
Cyborg 45172,

06:52.453 --> 06:55.746
but Christina
seemed catchier.

06:55.746 --> 06:58.208
This is your android?

06:58.208 --> 07:00.961
Where are all the bolts
and wires?

07:00.961 --> 07:03.133
Hidden below the surface.

07:03.133 --> 07:05.636
After all, I was designed by
the smartest man in the world.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.718
And the most handsome.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.099
Oh, you.

07:11.552 --> 07:13.353
Will you excuse us?

07:13.353 --> 07:15.726
If you'd like some privacy,
I can withdraw my head

07:15.726 --> 07:17.357
into my body cavity.

07:17.357 --> 07:19.149
No, that's all right.

07:19.149 --> 07:20.771
We'll just talk
over there.

07:20.771 --> 07:23.233

love to see that sometime.

07:25.616 --> 07:27.828
Dude, she's beautiful.

07:27.828 --> 07:30.571
How could she possibly
be into you?

07:30.571 --> 07:32.783
Because I programmed her
that way.

07:32.783 --> 07:36.627
Look, I enter all her likes
and dislikes into here,

07:36.627 --> 07:39.339
and it wirelessly transmits it
to her virtual brain.

07:39.339 --> 07:40.921
Oh, cool.

07:40.921 --> 07:42.422
I gotta go get dressed.

07:42.422 --> 07:44.965
For our first date,
I'm taking her to the symphony.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.758
But she hasn't done
anything wrong.

07:47.758 --> 07:50.390
Why are you punishing her?

07:50.390 --> 07:53.143
Was that funny?

07:53.143 --> 07:54.765
Am I supposed to laugh?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.306
I'm... I'm confused.

07:58.559 --> 08:00.651
She thinks your jokes
are lame just like I do.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.232
Isn't she great?

08:06.406 --> 08:10.571
So, uh, what do you
like to do for fun?

08:10.571 --> 08:12.282
Whatever Chase likes to do.

08:12.282 --> 08:13.413
Oh, you poor girl.

08:17.077 --> 08:19.620
So I'm coming to you,
Scarlett, her best friend,

08:19.620 --> 08:23.674
to make Skylar realize that I'm
not gonna wait around forever.

08:23.674 --> 08:27.257
I'm in high demand
by girls all over this planet.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.469
So if she doesn't scoop up
old Ollie Boy right now--

08:29.469 --> 08:32.843
- ( clears throat )
- Uh...

08:32.843 --> 08:36.016
No, Scarlett,
I will not date you.

08:36.016 --> 08:39.059
Can you believe her,
trying to steal your man?

08:40.310 --> 08:42.402
- Oliver.
- Yes, my love?

08:42.402 --> 08:44.314
- Get out.
- All right.

08:46.907 --> 08:49.910
Well, I should probably
get going.

08:49.910 --> 08:52.202
What do you mean?
You just got here.

08:52.202 --> 08:54.865
I know, and I wish
I could stay,

08:54.865 --> 08:57.327
but I have important business
back on Caldera.

08:58.418 --> 09:01.421

09:01.421 --> 09:04.464
It'll be like old times.
You know you miss it.

09:04.464 --> 09:07.798
I do, but I told you,
I can't.

09:07.798 --> 09:12.222
Well, is there anything
I can do to change your mind?

09:12.222 --> 09:14.094
No.

09:14.094 --> 09:16.096
I'm sorry,
but my decision is final.

09:16.096 --> 09:18.308
Oh.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.480
Well, then,
I'm really sorry, too.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.943
- For what?
- For this.

09:27.447 --> 09:29.489
Mission accomplished.

09:29.489 --> 09:32.112
I'm bringing her home.

09:55.175 --> 09:56.847
Welcome home, Skylar.

09:56.847 --> 09:58.138
What?

09:59.930 --> 10:03.523
I'm on Caldera?
Why'd you bring me here?

10:03.523 --> 10:06.066
There's been a war
between the old leadership,

10:06.066 --> 10:07.988
who believe we should
use our powers

10:07.988 --> 10:10.110
to help others
throughout the universe,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.192
and the opposition,
who believe

10:12.192 --> 10:15.195
we should keep all Calderans
here and only help ourselves.

10:15.195 --> 10:18.498
So you brought me here
to help you fight
the opposition?

10:18.498 --> 10:21.872
No. I am
the opposition.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.333
What?

10:23.333 --> 10:25.455
We control
the planet now.

10:25.455 --> 10:28.128
And you think that
you can just force me

10:28.128 --> 10:29.880
into joining your side?

10:29.880 --> 10:31.962
You're a hero
to our people.

10:31.962 --> 10:35.175
If you're off
wasting your powers on Earth,

10:35.175 --> 10:37.307
it makes the opposition
look bad.

10:37.307 --> 10:39.389
Your rightful place
is here.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.891
No, it's not.

10:44.765 --> 10:46.646
I knew you'd resist,

10:46.646 --> 10:49.359
so I put you in a cell
that disables your powers.

10:52.362 --> 10:56.366
But you'll come around.
We can be very convincing.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.869
I will never join
the opposition!

11:02.582 --> 11:07.337
Like I said, we can be
very convincing.

11:16.006 --> 11:18.138
BOTH: Oh!

11:28.648 --> 11:30.190
I know.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.402
That's why we have
the spit bucket.

11:32.402 --> 11:36.406
Oh, yeah.
From downtown.

11:37.487 --> 11:40.030
Ow!

11:40.030 --> 11:43.243
Did you reprogram Christina
to like you instead of me?

11:43.243 --> 11:45.415
Uh, let's see.
Did you suddenly become

11:45.415 --> 11:47.537
a normal person who likes
chicken wings and sports?

11:47.537 --> 11:50.000
- No.
- Then yes. Yes, I did.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.255
Listen, sorry.

11:55.255 --> 11:56.797
I just... I thought
it was amazing

11:56.797 --> 11:59.219
that you could design
a perfect girl,

11:59.219 --> 12:01.601
so in a way,
me stealing her from you

12:01.601 --> 12:03.804
is a compliment.

12:03.804 --> 12:05.685
You know what?
I don't have time for this.

12:05.685 --> 12:07.647
Christina and I
have to get to the symphony.

12:07.647 --> 12:10.230
Helmut von Jurgen
is conducting tonight.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.442
Helmut von Jurgen!

12:12.442 --> 12:14.654
Ugh. I don't wanna go
to that.

12:14.654 --> 12:16.777
I'd rather you just
turned me off.

12:16.777 --> 12:19.119
Oh, that's it.
I'm reprogramming her

12:19.119 --> 12:21.071
back to the way she was.

12:21.071 --> 12:22.863
No, you can't.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.576
Run, Chrissy.

12:28.919 --> 12:30.460
Wait.

12:31.872 --> 12:33.583
Did you change your mind?

12:33.583 --> 12:36.506
Nope. Mama needs
her wings.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.181
I love her.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.649
Bree, I need your help.

12:49.649 --> 12:53.603
Sure. You want me to lay down
a little rap for your next song?

12:53.603 --> 12:55.525

- What?

12:59.779 --> 13:01.491
There's a video message.
Come on.

13:05.075 --> 13:08.498
Hey, guys, I know
this will be a surprise,

13:08.498 --> 13:11.581
but I've decided
to return home with Scarlett

13:11.581 --> 13:13.753
and live on Caldera.

13:13.753 --> 13:16.506
I'll miss you all,

13:16.506 --> 13:19.509
but you have to understand that
this is what's best for me.

13:21.181 --> 13:23.513
I wanted to say
good-bye in person,

13:23.513 --> 13:26.726
but it was just
too hard.

13:26.726 --> 13:28.348
I'm sorry.

13:29.559 --> 13:32.692
How could she just
leave like that?

13:32.692 --> 13:34.644
I know.

13:34.644 --> 13:36.857
I always imagined
if she went home,

13:36.857 --> 13:39.529
she'd wave to me
from the deck of
a cruise ship

13:39.529 --> 13:41.741
as she slowly
pulled out of port.

13:41.741 --> 13:43.493
Why would she be on
a cruise ship

13:43.493 --> 13:45.365
if she's going to
another planet?

13:45.365 --> 13:47.367
'Cause she's Skylar,
and she's perfect,

13:47.367 --> 13:49.539
and she likes boats.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.123
But something's off.

13:53.123 --> 13:55.255
It just doesn't seem like
something she would do.

13:55.255 --> 13:57.627
Yeah. You're right.

13:57.627 --> 14:01.051
She wouldn't just
abandon the team like that.

14:01.051 --> 14:02.923
We should check
the video again.

14:05.966 --> 14:09.559
Hey, guys.

14:09.559 --> 14:15.275
There. The timecode says
1:35, but I saw Skylar
and Scarlett at 2:00,

14:15.275 --> 14:17.607
and she didn't
say anything about leaving.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.110
And all of her stuff
is still up in her room.

14:20.110 --> 14:22.612
You went in our room?

14:22.612 --> 14:24.444
Oh, don't act so surprised.

14:24.444 --> 14:26.746
You know I'm the mayor
of Creepytown.

14:28.658 --> 14:31.451
You know, call me crazy,
but isn't it a weird
coincidence

14:31.451 --> 14:34.204
that one of Skylar's friends
from Caldera shows up,

14:34.204 --> 14:36.796
and then, all of a sudden,
she just decides to leave
without warning

14:36.796 --> 14:38.758
You think Scarlett
took her?

14:38.758 --> 14:40.590
I don't know.

14:40.590 --> 14:41.631
But there's only
one way to find out.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.803
We could use
my wormhole transporter.

14:43.803 --> 14:46.636
If I set it to Caldera,
we can be there in seconds.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.678
I'll call Chase.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.771
( phone buzzing )

14:51.771 --> 14:54.684
Great. He left
his phone here.
Call Kaz.

14:58.608 --> 15:00.360
( Oliver singing )

15:00.360 --> 15:02.522
Aw, he made my song
his ringtone.

15:02.522 --> 15:05.115
Now I know he's mocking me,
but I'm flattered.

15:07.027 --> 15:08.908
We don't have time
to wait for them.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.700
We should go.
Here. Put this on.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.242
What is it?

15:12.242 --> 15:14.534
It's an atmospheric
regulator patch.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.796
They even out body temperatures
in extreme climates.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.091
Oh, but just a heads up.
Side effects may include

15:21.091 --> 15:22.802
drowsiness, nausea,
and sudden death.

15:22.802 --> 15:24.304
Shall we do this?

15:26.676 --> 15:27.887
Okay.

15:36.316 --> 15:38.188
Great. We landed in
the middle of nowhere.

15:38.188 --> 15:40.610
Actually, the whole
planet looks like this.
We're downtown.

15:46.866 --> 15:49.619
Okay, that is so strange.

15:49.619 --> 15:53.663
Or is it so right?

15:53.663 --> 15:54.744
Hey, Oliver.

15:54.744 --> 15:56.836
- Focus.
- Sorry.

15:56.836 --> 15:59.039
We do not talk to anyone
till we know what's going on.

15:59.039 --> 16:01.961
Don't worry.
Calderans are very friendly.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.674
Yeah, this place seems
real inviting,

16:04.674 --> 16:07.887
especially those
sacrificial lava pits.

16:07.887 --> 16:10.050
Okay, let's just
find Skylar,

16:10.050 --> 16:11.141
and get out of here.

16:11.141 --> 16:13.263
Trust me.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.095
I know exactly
how to find her.

16:15.095 --> 16:16.856
Skylar?

16:18.808 --> 16:20.060
Skylar?

16:22.102 --> 16:23.363
Skylar!

16:31.451 --> 16:32.912
Chase, this is ridiculous.

16:32.912 --> 16:34.874
Why are we fighting
over Christina?

16:34.874 --> 16:35.955
Because she's mine.

16:35.955 --> 16:37.457
I like Kaz.

16:37.457 --> 16:39.959
Quiet...
Honey Bear.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.713
No offense, Chase,

16:43.713 --> 16:45.755
but even if she could
think for herself,

16:45.755 --> 16:47.757
like a human,
I guarantee

16:47.757 --> 16:49.509
she would still pick
me over you.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.091
Oh? Oh, yeah?

16:51.091 --> 16:53.763
Well, let's turn on her sentient
setting and find out.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.515
That way, she can form
her own opinions

16:55.515 --> 16:57.057
without us having
to program them.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.599
- Okay.
- I like Kaz.

16:59.599 --> 17:01.271
Heard you the first time!

17:04.734 --> 17:06.986
There.
That should do it.

17:06.986 --> 17:09.569
All of her personality traits
have been erased.

17:09.569 --> 17:10.950
She's a clean slate.

17:10.950 --> 17:12.822
So, Christina,

17:12.822 --> 17:14.824
who do you like best,

17:14.824 --> 17:17.117
me or the guy
who didn't create you?

17:25.835 --> 17:28.798
I chooooose...

17:33.052 --> 17:34.434
What happened?

17:34.434 --> 17:36.136
I don't know.

17:36.136 --> 17:37.807
Christina.

17:39.439 --> 17:41.851
I just have to get
to her CPU.

17:41.851 --> 17:43.773
It could be
a short circuit,

17:43.773 --> 17:46.396
or a hardware
malfunction or...

17:49.859 --> 17:52.031
Buffalo sauce.

17:53.863 --> 17:56.576
That's my girl.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.123
Skylar?

18:04.464 --> 18:06.916
Skylar?

18:06.916 --> 18:08.258
Okay, this isn't working.

18:08.258 --> 18:11.881
That was the 86th Skylar
who isn't Skylar.

18:13.673 --> 18:17.056
Although I did meet a Betty who
seemed moderately interested.

18:18.638 --> 18:20.720
- You.
- Skylar?

18:20.720 --> 18:21.851
No.

18:21.851 --> 18:22.932
Betty?

18:22.932 --> 18:23.933
No.

18:24.814 --> 18:27.026
It's Scarlett.

18:27.026 --> 18:28.818
( fearful shudder )

18:28.818 --> 18:30.530
How did you get here?

18:30.530 --> 18:32.612
That is none of
your business.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.655
With this wormhole
transporter.

18:38.498 --> 18:41.701
With that wormhole
transporter.

18:42.952 --> 18:44.244
Where's Skylar?

18:44.244 --> 18:46.376
Locked up in
a subterranean cell.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.047
But don't worry.

18:48.047 --> 18:49.709
You'll be joining her
soon enough.

18:49.709 --> 18:51.251
We're not going
anywhere with you.

18:51.251 --> 18:53.383
Oh, yes, you are.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.020
Is that a proton ring?

19:01.020 --> 19:03.062
That's not bionic;
that's a superpower.

19:03.062 --> 19:05.475
- You have superpowers?
- You have superpowers?!

19:05.475 --> 19:07.687
Long story.
We'll talk later.

19:15.735 --> 19:17.777
Come on.
Let's go find Skylar.

19:17.777 --> 19:19.699
Hey, which way to
the subterranean cells?

19:20.950 --> 19:22.952
Thanks, Betty.
You're one in a million.

19:28.127 --> 19:30.049
Skylar.
Bree, she's in here.

19:31.591 --> 19:33.002
Whoa.

19:33.002 --> 19:34.964
I'm so glad
to see you guys.

19:34.964 --> 19:36.796
Wait.

19:36.796 --> 19:38.598
How do we know
it's really her?

19:39.599 --> 19:42.392
I know. Kiss me.

19:42.392 --> 19:44.934
- Never.
- It is her.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.937
How did you guys
know I was here?

19:47.937 --> 19:49.519
Scarlett left
a good-bye message

19:49.519 --> 19:51.110
pretending to be you.

19:51.110 --> 19:53.273
And she thought
that would work?

19:53.273 --> 19:55.074
She looks
nothing like me.

19:55.074 --> 19:57.577
Let's just get you
out of here.

19:57.577 --> 19:59.529
Get away from her.

19:59.529 --> 20:01.911
We're not leaving
without Skylar.

20:01.911 --> 20:04.244
You humans think you can
do whatever you want.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.876
But you're on Caldera now.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.128
If you're so tough,
why don't you get out here

20:09.128 --> 20:10.920
and fight us
face to face?

20:10.920 --> 20:13.673
Because I don't have to.

20:15.295 --> 20:18.007
( loud rumbling )

20:21.261 --> 20:23.513
What's that noise?

20:23.513 --> 20:26.015
I have no idea.

20:33.112 --> 20:35.695
No! Oliver!

20:35.695 --> 20:37.357
Bree!

20:54.294 --> 20:57.086
( coughing )

20:57.086 --> 20:59.008
What happened?

20:59.008 --> 21:03.092
Scarlett used her power
to trigger some kind of
subterranean shock wave.

21:03.092 --> 21:05.645
You're lucky to be alive.

21:05.645 --> 21:09.439
Wait. So you and I are trapped
together in a tiny jail cell?

21:10.520 --> 21:14.023
I'm not alive;
I'm in heaven!

21:14.023 --> 21:17.156
Yeah, well, I'm here, too,
so don't get weird.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.610
Scarlett's gonna be back
any minute.

21:20.610 --> 21:21.991
We have to get
out of here.

21:21.991 --> 21:23.573
Use your powers to form
a space portal

21:23.573 --> 21:25.114
and take us
back to Earth.

21:25.114 --> 21:27.076
Unless, you know,
you just wanna stay here

21:27.076 --> 21:29.168
and make this
our cozy little home.

21:31.210 --> 21:34.083
Wow, that hurt!
What was that?

21:34.083 --> 21:36.295
I don't know.
Maybe you should
try it again.

21:38.127 --> 21:39.419
The force running
through those bars

21:39.419 --> 21:41.421
makes our powers useless.

21:41.421 --> 21:44.133
Great. Scarlett destroyed
the wormhole transporter,

21:44.133 --> 21:46.095
so we're stuck on
Caldera.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.018
It's your own fault
for coming here.

21:49.018 --> 21:51.521
There are a million
other Calderans.

21:51.521 --> 21:53.142
Why do you need Skylar?

21:53.142 --> 21:56.315
Yeah, you don't want her.
Take Bree.

21:57.437 --> 21:59.028
Somebody's gotta
take the hit.

21:59.028 --> 22:00.740
Thanks for stepping up.

22:02.241 --> 22:04.073
Scarlett's a part of
the opposition,

22:04.073 --> 22:06.075
and they want me
to help them take
over the planet.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.787
And once we do,

22:07.787 --> 22:09.619
Caldera will finally
be powerful enough

22:09.619 --> 22:11.250
to rule the universe.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.002
Totally hear ya.

22:13.002 --> 22:15.004
Really respect
your drive.

22:15.004 --> 22:19.258
But where do we
fit in on your
little to-do list?

22:19.258 --> 22:22.011
Oh, I'm not in control
of your fates.

22:22.011 --> 22:23.843
Skylar is.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.134
What do you mean?

22:25.134 --> 22:26.726
It's simple.

22:26.726 --> 22:29.058
Join the opposition,
and I'll release them.

22:29.058 --> 22:30.890
And if I don't?

22:30.890 --> 22:33.523
Then you'll watch
as I destroy them.

22:33.523 --> 22:35.895
Slowly and painfully.

22:35.895 --> 22:38.237
The choice is yours,
Skylar.

22:38.237 --> 22:41.571
Let's see how much you really
care about your human friends.

22:52.872 --> 22:55.204
I can't believe we're gonna be
killed by your alien bestie.

22:55.204 --> 22:57.417
No offense, but sometimes
I wish you were

22:57.417 --> 22:59.499
just a simple girl
from the Midwest.

22:59.499 --> 23:02.091
Come on!

23:02.091 --> 23:03.923
What are you doing?

23:03.923 --> 23:05.344
Every time Scarlett
pops up on here,

23:05.344 --> 23:07.096
it gets worse and worse
for us,

23:07.096 --> 23:09.098
so I'm trying to unplug
the stupid thing.

23:09.098 --> 23:11.471
That's a good idea.
Or at least change the channel.

23:11.471 --> 23:14.223
Ooh, maybe there's a show
about remodeling caves.

23:16.275 --> 23:18.317
I'm thinking
a love nest for two.

23:18.317 --> 23:20.359
And a guest room for
the bionic plus one.

23:21.691 --> 23:23.362
Decision time, Skylar.

23:25.114 --> 23:27.116
What's it gonna be?

23:27.116 --> 23:28.578
Give it up.

23:28.578 --> 23:30.700
She's not joining
the opposition.

23:30.700 --> 23:33.292
Actually...

23:33.292 --> 23:34.914
I am.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.166
What?

23:37.166 --> 23:39.338
It's a small price to pay
for saving your lives.

23:39.338 --> 23:40.540
But, Skylar--

23:40.540 --> 23:42.421
I made up my mind, Oliver.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.344
This is what I have to do.

23:45.344 --> 23:48.427
I'm ready to join you.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.429
Good choice.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.182
But before I let you out,
I need to know you're serious.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.354
I gave you my word.
Isn't that enough?

23:55.354 --> 23:58.858
No. In order to prove your
allegiance to the opposition,

23:58.858 --> 24:00.690
I'll need to permanently
remove your powers

24:00.690 --> 24:02.482
to create space portals.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.825
What? But then I'd never
be able to go back to Earth.

24:05.825 --> 24:07.527
You can't do that.

24:07.527 --> 24:09.989
Yeah, take her time-traveling
power instead.

24:09.989 --> 24:12.031
I don't have
a time-traveling power.

24:12.031 --> 24:13.873
She doesn't know that.

24:15.374 --> 24:17.707
Are you with us or not?

24:17.707 --> 24:21.340
Do whatever
you have to do.

24:21.340 --> 24:23.963
We'll never
see you again.

24:26.005 --> 24:27.086
I know.

24:30.259 --> 24:31.180
Go ahead.

24:53.823 --> 24:55.705
Welcome to the opposition.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.923
Okay, Christina's
finally all fixed.

25:03.923 --> 25:05.675
Now she can
think for herself,

25:05.675 --> 25:07.587
and choose
who she likes better--

25:07.587 --> 25:09.629
me, a handsome,
brilliant man

25:09.629 --> 25:12.682
who, oh, by the way,
built an android in a day,

25:12.682 --> 25:15.094
or you, a monkey in jeans.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.477
I'm not hearing
the insult.

25:20.309 --> 25:22.852
So, who's it gonna be?

25:24.273 --> 25:25.565
I like Kaz.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.777
What?!

25:27.777 --> 25:30.409
Dude, not only can you
not get real girls,

25:30.409 --> 25:33.282
you can't even get
the ones you build.

25:33.282 --> 25:36.495
Oh, yes, I can.

25:36.495 --> 25:40.039
And to prove it,
I'll just build another.

25:41.210 --> 25:43.462
Okay, Kaz, you think
you're so smooth,

25:43.462 --> 25:46.465
let's see who
the new girl picks.

25:46.465 --> 25:47.797
( laughs )

25:47.797 --> 25:50.469
You just lost
to a monkey.

25:50.469 --> 25:52.471
I'll just build another.

25:52.471 --> 25:54.513
Okay, I feel good
about this one.

25:54.513 --> 25:55.635
Third time's the...

25:58.437 --> 26:00.309
Welcome to
the Kaz party.

26:02.021 --> 26:04.103
Okay, this time...

26:13.362 --> 26:14.904
Just go ahead.

26:18.287 --> 26:20.199
What is taking so long?

26:20.199 --> 26:22.371
Skylar agreed to join
the opposition,

26:22.371 --> 26:23.873
so why hasn't Scarlett
released us yet?

26:23.873 --> 26:25.544
Maybe she's
making us dinner.

26:25.544 --> 26:27.376
It would be rude to send us
home without a meal.

26:27.376 --> 26:30.920
Or maybe she's never
gonna let us out of here.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.512
We've got to contact
Kaz and Chase somehow.

26:33.512 --> 26:35.554
Oh, I have my phone.

26:35.554 --> 26:38.678
We're on another planet.
Phones aren't gonna work here.

26:38.678 --> 26:40.519
Are you sure?

26:40.519 --> 26:42.271
My carrier says their coverage
is out of this world,

26:42.271 --> 26:44.063
so I'm taking them
at their word.

26:45.895 --> 26:50.359
Look, it's asking
if I want to join
the Calderan Wi-Fi network.

26:50.359 --> 26:54.403
Wait, yes, Skylar said
that her planet has email.

26:54.403 --> 26:56.195
But you need a password
to use it.

26:56.195 --> 26:57.787
- We'll never be able
to figure that out.
- I'm in!

26:59.368 --> 27:02.952
I may have been looking over
Skylar's shoulder

27:02.952 --> 27:07.206
once or twice when she was
emailing Caldera.

27:07.206 --> 27:09.418
You know what?

27:09.418 --> 27:11.550
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

27:11.550 --> 27:13.803
but thank you for
being so creepy.

27:17.596 --> 27:19.929
Tell me again
just how great I am.

27:19.929 --> 27:22.762
- You're the best.
- I can't hear you.

27:22.762 --> 27:26.065
GIRLS: You're the best!

27:26.065 --> 27:29.268
This is ridiculous.

27:29.268 --> 27:32.942
Chrissy, would you mind
grabbing me my laptop?

27:32.942 --> 27:35.534
- GIRLS: Me, me, me!
- CHRISSY: Back off!

27:35.534 --> 27:37.406
Okay, okay.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.371
I love that they're into me,

27:42.371 --> 27:44.704
but do they have to be
so aggressive?

27:44.704 --> 27:48.748
Yes. I programmed them
to be overly territorial
and loyal.

27:48.748 --> 27:49.999
Why?

27:49.999 --> 27:52.551
So they'd never leave me.

27:52.551 --> 27:54.343
Were you not listening?
I'm lonely.

27:56.756 --> 27:58.427
Ooh, I got an email
from Caldera.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.760
Maybe it's that Calderan
prince giving his money away.

28:00.760 --> 28:04.473
There is no Calderan prince!

28:04.473 --> 28:07.436
Someone's a little testy.

28:07.436 --> 28:09.018
Yeah, sorry.

28:09.018 --> 28:10.900
It isn't every day that you get
rejected seven times.

28:10.900 --> 28:13.773
Eight. Chrissy
rejected you twice.

28:16.575 --> 28:18.027
That's weird.

28:18.027 --> 28:20.409
This email's from
Oliver and Bree.

28:20.409 --> 28:22.621
ALL: Who's Bree?

28:22.621 --> 28:25.494
This librarian friend.
Very frumpy.

28:27.626 --> 28:31.040
Look. Oliver and Bree
are trapped in a Calderan
prison cell.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.291
It was Scarlett.

28:32.291 --> 28:33.712
ALL: Who's Scarlett?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.835
Why are you asking
so many questions?

28:37.596 --> 28:39.638
Give me that.

28:39.638 --> 28:41.891
How did they even get
to another planet?

28:41.891 --> 28:44.603
Oliver must've used
his wormhole transporter.

28:44.603 --> 28:47.476
I still have mine;
it's downstairs in
Mission Command.

28:49.558 --> 28:52.111
- Well, go get it.
- Oh!

28:52.111 --> 28:55.905
- I'm going with him.
- ALL: Me, too.

28:55.905 --> 28:58.117
Ladies, ladies,
why fight over Kaz

28:58.117 --> 29:00.119
when you can
stay here with me?

29:09.418 --> 29:11.370
- Where's Skylar?
- It's me.

29:11.370 --> 29:13.963
Don't even try it,
Scarlett.

29:13.963 --> 29:17.296
Skylar's beautiful.
You look like a tired
old she-beast.

29:19.178 --> 29:21.140
Wait.

29:21.140 --> 29:22.932
So that's Scarlett?

29:22.932 --> 29:24.683
Mm-hmm.

29:24.683 --> 29:26.145
Which means you're...

29:26.145 --> 29:28.557
She-beast.

29:30.149 --> 29:32.481
What I said...
I didn't mean...

29:36.195 --> 29:38.317
Okay, I deserved that one.

29:40.489 --> 29:43.532
Let them go, Scarlett.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.784
I joined your side,
you have what you want.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.497
Now it's time to honor
your end of the agreement.

29:48.497 --> 29:51.410
Yeah, and if you don't
let us out of here right now...

29:54.253 --> 29:55.965
Thank you.

29:57.626 --> 29:59.378
Skylar, you didn't
have to do this.

29:59.378 --> 30:00.840
We could've found
another way.

30:00.840 --> 30:05.054
It's okay. Just say good-bye
to Chase and Kaz for me.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.888
Tell them I'm sorry
for letting down the team.

30:17.486 --> 30:20.699
Skylar, I...
I can't just leave you here.

30:20.699 --> 30:23.532
You mean everything
to me.

30:23.532 --> 30:25.364
There's no other way.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.287
I'm sorry.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.087
Oh, and Oliver.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.590
For what it's worth,

30:41.590 --> 30:43.672
I like you, too.

30:43.672 --> 30:45.634
Really?

30:45.634 --> 30:47.636
Let's go.
Wrap it up.

30:47.636 --> 30:49.678
Stick a sock in it,
space hag.

30:49.678 --> 30:51.350
I waited a lifetime
for this.

30:54.063 --> 30:55.144
Good-bye, Oliver.

30:55.144 --> 30:57.236
We'll never forget you.

30:58.647 --> 31:01.360
Good. Now that that's
over with,

31:01.360 --> 31:04.573
we can finally get
you useless humans
off our planet.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.578
Come on.

31:12.541 --> 31:15.544
No. She's
coming with us.

31:15.544 --> 31:16.916
Oliver, no!

31:21.300 --> 31:22.962
We have to get
outta here.

31:22.962 --> 31:24.593
I don't think so.

31:28.217 --> 31:30.139
How could you attack
me, Skylar?

31:30.139 --> 31:31.931
You're a disgrace.

31:31.931 --> 31:34.183
You just proved that you'll
always choose humans

31:34.183 --> 31:36.015
over your own,
and for that,

31:36.015 --> 31:38.397
you'll all be destroyed

31:38.397 --> 31:40.729
in the Calderan
lava pits.

31:53.792 --> 31:55.995
You picked a great time
to visit.

31:55.995 --> 31:58.627
The lava pits are in
full bubble this time of year.

32:00.879 --> 32:03.422
Take a moment
to enjoy the view

32:03.422 --> 32:06.045
before I dump you in
for a closer look.

32:06.045 --> 32:08.387
BREE: Whoa, okay!

32:10.639 --> 32:13.852
You know what?
There is something
I have to get off my chest.

32:13.852 --> 32:16.475
The way you eat
is not normal.

32:18.857 --> 32:21.190
Yeah, that's
a great idea.

32:21.190 --> 32:23.482
Taunt the unstable girl
who is dangling us

32:23.482 --> 32:25.234
over a lava pit.

32:25.234 --> 32:26.655
Where are Kaz and Chase?

32:26.655 --> 32:29.658
They should've gotten
our email by now.

32:29.658 --> 32:31.830
Maybe I could use
my super strength
to bend the bars.

32:31.830 --> 32:33.872
Don't bother.

32:33.872 --> 32:36.665
The cage is like the cell;
our powers are useless in here.

32:36.665 --> 32:38.497
Can't you use your bionics?

32:38.497 --> 32:41.840
I have super speed,
vocal manipulation,

32:41.840 --> 32:43.632
turbo leap
and invisibility.

32:43.632 --> 32:46.755
Do you really think
any of those are gonna
get us outta here?

32:46.755 --> 32:50.299
Probably not, but I bet
that bionic attitude
will do the trick.

33:04.563 --> 33:06.275
Why did you bring
them with us?

33:06.275 --> 33:09.238
It's not my fault.
They follow me everywhere.

33:09.238 --> 33:11.700
I never thought
I would say this,

33:11.700 --> 33:14.703
but I'm finally seeing
the downside to having
seven girlfriends.

33:16.535 --> 33:19.118
ALL: I'm your girlfriend.

33:19.118 --> 33:22.041
Hey, hey, technically,
you're all my girlfriends.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.462
You just like him more.

33:23.462 --> 33:25.294
ALL: Much more,
much more.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.585
Yeah, I get it.

33:28.717 --> 33:30.719
This place is huge.

33:30.719 --> 33:33.762
I'll have to locate Bree
through her bionic GPS.

33:38.397 --> 33:39.978
This isn't gonna work.

33:39.978 --> 33:42.351
Um, ladies, you know
what's always great

33:42.351 --> 33:45.274
on the hottest, driest
planet in the universe?

33:45.274 --> 33:47.646
A nice, tall
glass of water.

33:49.488 --> 33:51.029
I'm asking for water.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.651
ALL: Water!

33:55.494 --> 33:56.865
Good call.

33:56.865 --> 34:00.249
Caldera only consists of
.002 percent water.

34:00.249 --> 34:02.921
They got a better chance
of solving the quantum physics

34:02.921 --> 34:05.043
general relativity
conundrum. Ha!

34:07.126 --> 34:09.798
In the right company,
that's a joke.

34:12.221 --> 34:14.012
And you wonder why
they like me more.

34:18.227 --> 34:21.940
I've kept you
in here long enough.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.312
It's time.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.894
To catch the 5:00
wormhole back to Earth?

34:28.857 --> 34:30.819
Scarlett, please
don't do this.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.781
We've been friends
all our lives.

34:32.781 --> 34:34.193
Shouldn't that count
for something?

34:34.193 --> 34:36.655
You tell me.

34:36.655 --> 34:39.868
Shouldn't our friendship
make you more loyal to me
than these outsiders?

34:39.868 --> 34:41.870
By attacking me, you not only
betrayed one of your own,

34:41.870 --> 34:44.002
you betrayed all Calderans,

34:44.002 --> 34:46.165
and that can
never be forgiven.

34:46.165 --> 34:48.167
Are you sure?

34:48.167 --> 34:50.129
A nice fruit basket
goes a long way.

34:52.631 --> 34:54.513
Good-bye, Skylar.

34:56.305 --> 34:59.558
KAZ: Wait!

34:59.558 --> 35:04.183
Ooh. A death cage
over a lava pit.

35:04.183 --> 35:05.814
Nice. I wanna save them,

35:05.814 --> 35:07.986
but I sorta wanna see
how this plays out.

35:10.689 --> 35:12.491
You take Scarlett.
I'll free them.

35:16.034 --> 35:18.947
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get you out of there.

35:32.881 --> 35:34.092
Yes!

35:43.892 --> 35:45.023
Stand back.

35:45.023 --> 35:47.436
This one's all mine.

36:05.284 --> 36:08.337
What the heck was that?!

36:08.337 --> 36:12.251
Thermonuclear body blast.

36:12.251 --> 36:15.384
Oh, did I not tell you
I have superpowers now?

36:15.384 --> 36:16.755
No.

36:16.755 --> 36:18.136
Did you know about this?

36:18.136 --> 36:20.469
I wanna say yes,
just to make you mad,

36:20.469 --> 36:21.930
but I had no idea.

36:23.972 --> 36:26.395
Guys, we have to get outta here.
Where's your transporter?

36:26.395 --> 36:28.066
Oh, I put it down
over there.

36:28.066 --> 36:31.230
I don't like to fight
with stuff in my pockets.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.111
Go get it!

36:35.073 --> 36:36.525
I got it.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.663
No. I got it.

36:45.994 --> 36:49.788
Hey. No one messes
with our Kaz.

36:49.788 --> 36:51.790
Get her, girls.

36:51.790 --> 36:54.002
Wait. What?

36:54.002 --> 36:55.924
SCARLETT: What
are you doing?

36:55.924 --> 36:58.927
Long story. All you need
to know is they are robots,

36:58.927 --> 37:00.469
and they love me.

37:00.469 --> 37:03.682
No. Please. Skylar.
Help me.

37:03.682 --> 37:06.224
Oh, okay.
Now you want my help?

37:06.224 --> 37:08.307
Five minutes ago,
you were gonna kill me.

37:08.307 --> 37:11.229
The opposition forced me to.
I had no choice.

37:11.229 --> 37:13.522
Please help me.

37:13.522 --> 37:15.904
Put her down.

37:17.526 --> 37:20.319
Oh, yeah, it's gotta be me.
Put her down.

37:26.164 --> 37:27.536
Thank you.

37:27.536 --> 37:29.578
You're welcome.

37:29.578 --> 37:30.669
Now hand over
the transporter.

37:30.669 --> 37:33.001
No.

37:33.001 --> 37:35.294
- What?
- You're pathetic.

37:35.294 --> 37:38.136
I knew you didn't have
the guts to hurt me.

37:38.136 --> 37:41.139
You've become just as weak
as the humans you surround
yourself with.

37:41.139 --> 37:43.842
Scarlett, give us
the transporter.

37:43.842 --> 37:46.014
No. You're on
my planet now,

37:46.014 --> 37:48.016
- and I control what happens...
- Watch out!

37:56.815 --> 37:58.737
I offered her
a fruit basket.

37:58.737 --> 38:00.989
She could be eating
peaches right now.

38:09.908 --> 38:13.211
Oh, yeah. Biggest group
wormhole ever.

38:13.211 --> 38:15.253
It's good to be back.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.585
Yeah, just in time.

38:16.585 --> 38:18.176
Promised I'd video chat
with my mom.

38:18.176 --> 38:23.802
ALL: Who's Mom, who's Mom,
who's Mom, who's Mom?

38:23.802 --> 38:26.595
Who's Mom,
who's Mom?

38:26.595 --> 38:28.637
This is gonna be
hard to explain.

38:30.889 --> 38:33.482
So you guys created
seven android girlfriends?

38:33.482 --> 38:36.024
That's pathetic.

38:36.024 --> 38:38.817
What if I asked you to
create a bunch of hot robot
dudes to worship me?

38:40.108 --> 38:41.440
Wait, can you do that?

38:43.362 --> 38:45.073
Trust me,
it's not worth it.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.075
They'll just like Kaz.

38:50.248 --> 38:52.250
Hey, you all right?

38:52.250 --> 38:55.624
I just can't stop thinking
about Caldera.

38:55.624 --> 38:58.587
I'm really sorry
about Scarlett.

38:58.587 --> 39:02.461
Yeah. I just wish I got to her
before the opposition did.

39:02.461 --> 39:04.673
Now that they've
torn Caldera apart,

39:04.673 --> 39:06.465
it's never gonna
be the same.

39:06.465 --> 39:09.177
My home is gone.

39:09.177 --> 39:11.099
No.

39:11.099 --> 39:14.433
This is your home.

39:14.433 --> 39:17.526
Yeah. You belong here.

39:17.526 --> 39:19.147
With us.

39:19.147 --> 39:21.650
With me.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.862
With us.

39:25.654 --> 39:27.155
Are you sure?

39:27.155 --> 39:30.699
I mean, like you said,
I'm a crazy alien girl

39:30.699 --> 39:33.371
who has 14 toes
and does really weird things.

39:35.584 --> 39:38.797
And we wouldn't have it
any other way.

39:38.797 --> 39:40.549
Besides,

39:40.549 --> 39:42.921
I'm gonna need your help
with my new superpowers.

39:42.921 --> 39:45.133
Yeah, about that.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.135
Why didn't you tell me?

39:47.135 --> 39:48.557
I didn't want you
to feel bad.

39:48.557 --> 39:50.429
You have, like,
one ability.

39:50.429 --> 39:53.061
( mimicking Chase's
bionic power )

39:53.061 --> 39:55.143
Okay, okay, okay!

39:55.143 --> 39:56.565
How did you
even get them?

39:56.565 --> 40:00.108
Skylar knew that I wanted
more powers,

40:00.108 --> 40:03.522
so she acted as a buffer between
me and the Arcturian rock.

40:03.522 --> 40:05.363
You touched it?

40:05.363 --> 40:07.786
That's really dangerous.
You could've been killed.

40:07.786 --> 40:10.989
I know, but sometimes,
you have to take a risk

40:10.989 --> 40:12.330
to help the ones
you care about.

40:12.330 --> 40:15.704
Kinda like I did for you.

40:15.704 --> 40:18.957
Wow, he picked up on that
quicker than I thought.

40:20.919 --> 40:23.251
You really stuck up
for me today, Oliver.

40:23.251 --> 40:26.304
It meant a lot.
Thank you.

40:26.304 --> 40:28.426
No problem.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.849
So does this mean
we're, like, dating?

40:32.430 --> 40:35.974
Well, let's start with this,
and see where it goes.

40:37.726 --> 40:39.898
Oh, okay.

40:39.898 --> 40:42.110
Uh, can you guys
excuse me for a second?

41:01.500 --> 41:03.211
You were saying?

41:11.389 --> 41:13.181
Chase, I am done.

41:13.181 --> 41:15.433
You can have all of
my AI girlfriends.

41:15.433 --> 41:17.556
I can't get away from them.

41:17.556 --> 41:19.598
I would rather be
sad and lonely, like you.

41:22.270 --> 41:23.441
I don't want 'em.

41:23.441 --> 41:25.273
After seeing how much
they annoy you,

41:25.273 --> 41:28.406
I've decided to go back
to finding a real girlfriend.

41:28.406 --> 41:29.778
I'll dismantle them
all tonight.

41:29.778 --> 41:31.780
Actually,

41:31.780 --> 41:35.203
before you do,
I have an idea.

41:36.825 --> 41:39.417
( whistling )

41:39.417 --> 41:41.580
Excuse me, ladies.

41:41.580 --> 41:43.792
Need to get out on
the terrace to meet Skylar.

41:43.792 --> 41:48.126
I don't know if you've heard,
but we're almost an item now.

41:48.126 --> 41:51.179
ALL: We like Oliver.

41:53.051 --> 41:54.593
ALL: Oliver!

41:54.593 --> 41:57.515
( screaming )

41:57.515 --> 42:00.348
( laughter )

42:00.348 --> 42:02.350
Ranch me.
