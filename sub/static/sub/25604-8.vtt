01:05.560 --> 01:08.920
As soon as she went in,
I called Inspector Majid.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.640
She never came out.

01:12.120 --> 01:14.320
Only the fair-skinned man came out.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.560
-What did he look like?
-He was tall and fair, with short hair.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.640
I can help to put together
a sketch of him.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.040
Is this him?

01:25.120 --> 01:26.840
Yes, that looks like him.

01:30.200 --> 01:31.120
Where's Sartaj?

01:31.680 --> 01:34.360
I tried calling him. He didn't answer.

04:30.080 --> 04:31.720
You're lucky.

04:34.680 --> 04:37.560
Every religion says the same thing.

04:39.360 --> 04:42.520
Everything is predestined.

04:47.120 --> 04:52.400
The day I was born in Luxor, Egypt...

04:55.480 --> 04:58.600
and you were born in Bombay...

04:59.840 --> 05:04.800
it was decided
that we'd meet here one day...

05:05.960 --> 05:07.280
and I would do this.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.240
Just two hours.

05:33.440 --> 05:35.680
Soon, all the pain will fade.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.960
What are you guys doing here?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.160
Preparing for the 16th.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.000
What's going to happen on the 16th?

05:48.200 --> 05:50.360
Why did Gaitonde kill himself?

05:51.120 --> 05:53.040
Some people are weak.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.040
How did you betray him?

05:58.640 --> 06:01.600
Me? He betrayed us.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.600
Adam and Hawwa had two sons...

06:14.640 --> 06:16.280
Habil and Qabil.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.120
Allah asked them for a sacrifice.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.680
Both of them
offered their sacrifices to him,

06:24.240 --> 06:27.480
but Allah only accepted Habil's.

06:28.840 --> 06:31.840
Qabil didn't like this,
and he killed Habil.

06:34.240 --> 06:37.400
But Allah decorated Habil.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.960
Habil, the world's first martyr.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.040
And the world's first criminal...

06:50.280 --> 06:53.520
who was destined to go to hell, Qabil.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.600
This story is in the Bible too.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.440
Habil is Abel and Qabil is Cain.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.120
We need to make sacrifices in our lives.

07:08.040 --> 07:12.480
They have a message for us.
Why do we need to make sacrifices?

07:12.960 --> 07:13.840
Why?

07:15.440 --> 07:16.400
Why?

07:18.680 --> 07:20.680
I don't know!

07:22.760 --> 07:25.800
Allah is fed up with us.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.720
He was sick of us
since the moment he made us.

07:33.200 --> 07:35.240
We have to bear the pain for him,

07:35.320 --> 07:38.680
have to give him another chance
to start again...

07:39.760 --> 07:40.800
from the beginning.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.160
That's the debt we owe him.

08:02.160 --> 08:03.640
<i>Everybody come out.</i>

08:04.680 --> 08:07.120
<i>We have the place surrounded.</i>

08:08.040 --> 08:09.200
<i>Surrender yourself.</i>

08:45.160 --> 08:47.160
We have the place surrounded.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.080
There's no way to escape.

08:51.480 --> 08:53.080
It's best if you all surrender.

09:32.720 --> 09:35.000
The cops are here. I'm leaving.

12:51.080 --> 12:52.160
Sartaj.

13:15.160 --> 13:20.080
<i>I knew from Dilbagh Singh's face</i>
<i>that Parulkar would kill me.</i>

13:21.200 --> 13:25.160
<i>Their plan was to kill me</i>
<i>inside the prison.</i>

13:36.640 --> 13:40.280
<i>With time, we get used to everything.</i> <i>After being beat continuously</i>
<i>for 22 days, I got used to it.</i>

13:49.840 --> 13:52.120
<i>Get up, bathe, get thrashed,</i>
<i>go to sleep, repeat.</i>

13:54.880 --> 13:57.480
Hit him! Hit him!

14:01.400 --> 14:05.600
<i>Just when I began to expect</i>
<i>that nothing would change...</i>

14:08.160 --> 14:09.240
<i>I saw Mathu...</i>

14:11.440 --> 14:12.840
<i>my old friend.</i>

14:13.680 --> 14:14.520
Mathu.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.160
<i>My partner in Mandrax,</i>
<i>back in Salim Kaka's gold-smuggling days.</i>

14:25.720 --> 14:30.360
Easy money turns men into fools.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.080
Sir, tea.

14:34.880 --> 14:35.880
Here, have some.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.840
I couldn't handle it.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.240
If you'd stayed with me,
we could've destroyed them together.

14:45.520 --> 14:46.920
But you're here.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.720
I'm the king of Gopalmath.

14:52.280 --> 14:55.560
I'm here by my own will.
They're all scared shitless of me.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.480
Do you think I'm worthless?

15:00.440 --> 15:04.200
Tell me if anyone gives you problems,
and I'll take care of them.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.560
Isa's men... they're bastards.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.520
Isa fled the country,

15:14.880 --> 15:18.520
and these guys,
they still think they own it.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.200
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach them a lesson.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.640
Gaitonde.

15:26.520 --> 15:29.080
These guys are prepared
to cremate you in the prison.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.880
They won't let you get out alive.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.040
And you're talking about saving me?

15:51.440 --> 15:52.920
The next one's a home run, okay?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.840
Here comes a Gaitonde home run. Look.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.760
Look, bastard, here comes a home run.

15:59.840 --> 16:04.320
<i>Back then, I thought Parulkar</i>
<i>was torturing me on Isa's orders.</i>

16:16.560 --> 16:21.320
<i>What I didn't know is that</i>
<i>the ones trying to break me</i>

16:21.400 --> 16:24.120
<i>were my dear friends,</i>
<i>Parulkar, Bhonsle and Trivedi,</i>

16:24.640 --> 16:28.240
<i>and that they were following</i>
<i>my third father's orders.</i>

16:28.440 --> 16:30.640
Has he given up?

16:32.880 --> 16:34.040
He will very soon.

16:34.520 --> 16:36.440
Don't end up killing him.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.240
Even if I chop him into pieces...

16:44.520 --> 16:48.600
and throw them into the sea,
he'd walk out in one piece,

16:48.720 --> 16:50.560
the bastard.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.360
Like the Terminator.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.720
-Fucker!
-That's how the <i>Mahabharata</i> begins.

17:00.720 --> 17:01.840
What?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.280
A king's semen falls into the sea.

17:04.760 --> 17:07.480
-Damn.
-A fish swallows it.

17:08.120 --> 17:12.520
A woman eats that fish and gets pregnant.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.440
She gives birth to India.

17:16.680 --> 17:19.920
A nation was born from the drops of semen.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.960
You remind me of my father.

17:24.440 --> 17:26.560
Was he a scholar?

17:27.120 --> 17:31.360
No... but he told stories like you.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.200
You guys...

18:19.040 --> 18:21.880
Be careful. Your life is in danger.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.200
There's not much time left.

18:25.880 --> 18:28.000
They'll kill me in two or three days.

18:28.880 --> 18:30.120
Why do you say that, boss? I know what's coming.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.960
I'll kill them all
if anything happens to you.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.760
Get me some kharvas.

18:38.320 --> 18:42.760
-The white one?
-Yes. I want to taste it one last time.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.440
Boss, please don't say that.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.160
Nothing will happen to you,
I'll get you out of here.

18:48.240 --> 18:49.800
Stop saying all this.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.160
-I was kidding. Listen.
-Yes?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.080
I need a knife
to take care of a few guys here.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.840
-He's a good man.
-Okay.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.680
Scream, motherfucker!

19:06.520 --> 19:09.080
You don't believe in God.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.080
What's your name?

20:01.320 --> 20:02.400
Jamila.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.240
Is this your first time?

20:11.640 --> 20:12.760
What did you say?

20:16.800 --> 20:18.120
What language is that?

20:18.680 --> 20:19.640
Farsi.

20:20.440 --> 20:21.560
Where are you from?

20:24.520 --> 20:26.800
Tell me, I'm not a cop.

20:31.720 --> 20:32.920
Afghanistan.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.280
We don't have much time. Just 20 minutes.

20:40.200 --> 20:42.760
I don't have the strength in me to...

20:44.600 --> 20:46.480
You don't have to do anything.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.280
<i>I was in such bad shape</i>

20:51.360 --> 20:53.880
<i>that I didn't even</i>
<i>have the strength to fuck.</i>

21:02.480 --> 21:07.080
<i>But I felt better when I thought about</i>
<i>taking revenge on Isa's men.</i>

21:15.480 --> 21:17.800
Hey, Isa's pig? Are you dead?

21:20.160 --> 21:21.040
Come on.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.640
-Wanna suck it?
-Do you have the balls?

21:26.600 --> 21:27.720
You want it, right?

21:32.960 --> 21:37.920
<i>I swear, slitting their throats</i>
<i>was more fun than fucking.</i>

22:17.000 --> 22:19.360
The only thing leaving here
is your corpse.

22:26.840 --> 22:30.840
Parulkar, do you get it now?
Even in prison, I'm a god.

22:33.840 --> 22:35.000
Mr. Singh?

22:37.040 --> 22:39.560
Fucking bastards.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.080
It's so dark in here.

22:46.600 --> 22:51.160
Where's the bloody toilet?
Where will I shit and piss?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.880
There's the bucket.

22:57.400 --> 23:01.720
They think this will kill me. Assholes.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.600
Gaitonde. Take a look.

23:09.520 --> 23:12.160
This is the isolation cell.
The ceiling is low.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.720
Shit and piss in the bucket.

23:15.240 --> 23:16.360
Keep this flashlight.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.440
Hide it in the bucket
if anyone comes to check.

23:20.080 --> 23:20.960
Take it. Be careful.

23:25.760 --> 23:27.120
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

23:39.800 --> 23:42.320
I'll lie down here. Bastards.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.480
<i>Does it still hurt?</i>

23:56.280 --> 23:57.200
A little bit.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.600
<i>Will it ever be normal again?</i>

24:01.600 --> 24:02.800
What's normal?

24:03.520 --> 24:07.520
Do you know what disabled people
call the abled?

24:07.600 --> 24:08.440
<i>What?</i>

24:12.960 --> 24:15.200
Anything can happen at any time.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.440
Everything's temporary.

24:23.840 --> 24:24.680
Everything. <i>Sartaj?</i>

24:31.080 --> 24:32.320
Please visit soon.

24:37.960 --> 24:38.920
How are you?

24:42.640 --> 24:43.880
The fever's gone.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.480
We're interrogating Bhonsle tomorrow.

24:52.680 --> 24:53.680
Did he agree?

24:54.280 --> 24:58.080
He can't avoid it,
not after Anjali's death.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.960
Any leads on Malcolm?

25:03.880 --> 25:07.120
But his fingerprints match those
found at Trivedi's house.

25:09.360 --> 25:12.560
It's almost certain that Anjali was...

25:15.040 --> 25:18.680
He can't get away.
All exit points are on alert.

25:18.840 --> 25:21.480
I wonder why anyone
would kill a RAW agent.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.480
It's a huge risk.

25:24.360 --> 25:25.960
We'll find out, Sartaj.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.760
Your NGO was transporting
Gaitonde's weapons to India

26:11.840 --> 26:13.520
in those water tankers.

26:13.960 --> 26:16.360
-What do you have to say about this?
-Nothing.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.480
<i>We're collecting evidence</i>
<i>from offshore accounts.</i>

26:20.520 --> 26:21.360
<i>Go ahead.</i>

26:22.240 --> 26:24.320
What do you know about Trivedi?

26:26.640 --> 26:27.600
Nothing.

26:28.280 --> 26:30.920
Bunty delivered those weapons to Malcolm.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.520
Who allowed him to use
a private freight line?

26:33.600 --> 26:36.160
Tell us or we'll have to file
a police report.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.120
Try doing that.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.240
Don't hold yourself back, sir.

26:44.560 --> 26:48.040
Do it for yourself,
if not for the country. It'll do you good.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.600
So, you don't know Trivedi?

27:06.520 --> 27:07.600
I do not.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.240
Trivedi e-mailed you this picture.

27:11.320 --> 27:12.720
Try to remember.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.440
We know there are more e-mails.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.320
Do it. Do what you want.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.800
You people will never understand.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.000
What are you talking about, sir?

27:26.080 --> 27:28.320
Aren't you ashamed
of betraying your country...?

27:28.440 --> 27:29.920
Shut up!

27:31.040 --> 27:32.920
-You can't see it.
-What can't we see?

27:33.000 --> 27:35.920
You can't see
that this country's in danger.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.960
You can't.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.280
Maybe you aren't aware

27:40.440 --> 27:45.000
that we're the most peaceful country
in history.

27:46.480 --> 27:50.840
We've never been the first to attack...
and this time is the same.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.400
But if we're attacked...

27:56.600 --> 27:59.080
we cannot keep quiet,
we must be ready.

27:59.160 --> 28:00.280
What attack?

28:01.240 --> 28:04.520
The country's in danger.
We can't just sit and wait.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.560
What danger?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.560
You're such a smart group of guys...

28:11.720 --> 28:12.960
figure it out yourselves.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.120
<i>Dilbagh Singh introduced me</i>
<i>to my third father.</i>

29:21.640 --> 29:23.720
<i>I called you to repay his debt.</i> <i>Everything will be destroyed in 25 days.</i>

29:44.560 --> 29:46.880
You'll blast us, bastard?

29:48.800 --> 29:51.440
You son of a bitch.

29:56.840 --> 29:58.400
Let go.

29:58.520 --> 30:03.400
Go ahead, shake it. Shake it.
You bloody worm. Motherfucker.

30:54.520 --> 30:57.000
Give me some water, Parulkar.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.120
Thirsty...

31:02.800 --> 31:04.240
Parulkar, give me some water.

31:08.480 --> 31:09.600
Mr. Singh.

31:11.760 --> 31:14.120
Please get me some water,
I'm dying of thirst.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.320
Are you really going to kill me, fuckers?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.400
Please give me some water, Mr. Singh.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.880
Or give me some piss.
Just give me something to drink.

31:27.960 --> 31:30.040
<i>Parulkar was a bastard.</i>

31:31.280 --> 31:37.680
<i>I could barely speak, or I'd have told him</i>
<i>to shoot me and end it all.</i>

31:38.520 --> 31:42.920
<i>I survived for about 25 days</i>
<i>without food or water.</i>

31:43.400 --> 31:45.320
<i>I had no strength left.</i>

31:45.880 --> 31:48.560
<i>Every day seemed like my last.</i>

32:01.480 --> 32:04.120
Three days ago,
you were all over the papers.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.720
Today, there'll be samosas served on them.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.160
And tomorrow, they'll be eaten by cows
scavenging in the garbage.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.000
Stop it. Your dad would've been so happy.

32:16.840 --> 32:18.480
I dreamt of him yesterday.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.400
He wouldn't have.

32:20.720 --> 32:21.560
What?

32:22.800 --> 32:24.320
He wouldn't have been happy.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.400
Why do you say that?

32:28.840 --> 32:31.760
He definitely had something
to do with Gaitonde,

32:32.400 --> 32:34.200
for him to send us the cricket bat.

32:34.880 --> 32:38.080
I told you,
his conscience was always clear.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.040
Then why did Gaitonde call me?

32:41.320 --> 32:42.880
Why would a famous gangster

32:43.240 --> 32:46.800
remember an ordinary officer
after 25 years?

32:46.880 --> 32:49.800
Because everyone remembers a good man.

32:50.520 --> 32:52.360
Your father wasn't ordinary.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.040
<i>I didn't mean that.</i>

33:01.120 --> 33:02.600
Then what did you mean?

33:03.280 --> 33:07.520
That he sold his integrity for this bat?

33:08.600 --> 33:09.800
Then what's the truth?

33:11.360 --> 33:16.600
The truth is that
when your father was at work,

33:17.160 --> 33:18.800
he often gave Gaitonde his food.

33:18.880 --> 33:19.840
Hold on.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.200
Did he work at the prison
where Gaitonde was being held?

33:24.840 --> 33:26.680
I checked the records
and didn't find anything.

33:27.640 --> 33:28.560
Yes.

33:29.000 --> 33:34.120
It was an unofficial posting
for two months under Parulkar.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.640
They'd beat him black and blue
in the prison.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.880
Gave him no food or water.

33:42.080 --> 33:45.440
He was kept in the isolation cell
for 15 days at a time.

33:46.200 --> 33:49.400
Everyone thought he'd die.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.800
<i>Your dad couldn't bear to see this,</i>

33:51.960 --> 33:54.920
<i>so he'd tell me to make extra rotis.</i>

33:55.880 --> 33:58.760
Mr. Ganesh. Mr. Ganesh.

34:05.760 --> 34:06.640
Mr. Ganesh.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.640
Eat this.

34:11.720 --> 34:16.000
<i>Your father saw Gaitonde</i>
<i>as just another human being,</i>

34:16.080 --> 34:17.440
and so he helped him.

34:18.320 --> 34:20.720
A while later,
Gaitonde called and thanked us,

34:21.200 --> 34:24.000
and he said, "Ask for anything you want."

34:24.080 --> 34:25.280
But he took nothing.

34:29.160 --> 34:31.080
One day, he casually mentioned

34:31.960 --> 34:34.000
that you wanted to be a cricketer.

34:34.080 --> 34:35.680
So Gaitonde sent us this bat.

34:37.480 --> 34:39.040
Someone wants to talk to you.

34:42.640 --> 34:46.280
Mr. Ganesh, hurry up. There's no time.
Someone will come. Come on, be strong.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.240
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

35:00.160 --> 35:01.040
<i>and chant...</i>

35:03.000 --> 35:07.840
<i>"I am the Alpha and the Omega.</i>

35:11.560 --> 35:13.480
<i>I am divinity itself."</i>

35:13.560 --> 35:17.560
<i>Close your eyes and chant,</i>
<i>"I am the Alpha and the Omega.</i>

35:18.360 --> 35:19.840
<i>I am divinity itself."</i>

35:19.920 --> 35:20.800
<i>Gaitonde...</i>

35:21.560 --> 35:22.640
<i>it's Trivedi.</i>

35:24.040 --> 35:25.600
<i>I know your condition.</i>

35:27.760 --> 35:29.760
<i>Guru-ji wants to have a word with you.</i>

35:32.840 --> 35:34.400
<i>Gaitonde, you'll live.</i>

35:35.160 --> 35:38.680
<i>You may feel like you're going to die,</i>

35:39.240 --> 35:42.480
<i>but remember this: you'll live.</i>

35:42.560 --> 35:47.040
<i>We all carry the burden of our fathers.</i>

35:48.080 --> 35:52.240
<i>In the West, the son envies the father.</i>

35:53.920 --> 35:57.480
<i>Freud called this the Oedipus Complex.</i> <i>Deep inside,</i>
<i>every son wants to kill his father.</i>

36:06.560 --> 36:09.880
<i>But we believe in Yayati.</i>

36:10.560 --> 36:12.520
<i>In stark contrast to the West...</i>

36:14.400 --> 36:18.720
<i>the son doesn't envy the father,</i>
<i>the father envies the son.</i>

36:20.800 --> 36:26.040
<i>The father wants to sacrifice the son.</i>

36:27.400 --> 36:31.040
<i>And eventually, he must do it.</i>

36:31.120 --> 36:35.520
<i>This is the blessing and the curse</i>
<i>of being a father.</i>

36:35.840 --> 36:37.160
Gaitonde's third father.

36:37.720 --> 36:38.640
Who are you?

36:40.000 --> 36:42.520
<i>A friend, a brother, an enemy,</i>

36:42.600 --> 36:47.680
<i>a father, a son, or a lover,</i>
<i>whatever you want me to be.</i>

36:48.080 --> 36:49.200
What do you want?

36:50.080 --> 36:54.120
<i>I want you to believe that you'll live.</i>

36:56.960 --> 36:59.360
Bullshit. They're going to kill me.

37:01.360 --> 37:05.640
<i>Relax.</i>
<i>Think about the first time you felt fear.</i>

37:06.600 --> 37:08.720
<i>Look at the wall in front of you.</i>

37:38.520 --> 37:39.440
I killed her.

37:40.600 --> 37:44.240
I killed my mother... with my own hands.

37:48.120 --> 37:49.440
I've sinned.

37:53.760 --> 37:55.680
I'm not going to survive.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.400
I'm going to rot and die here.

38:16.240 --> 38:19.360
<i>You're the door to the mandala</i>
<i>and the mandala itself.</i>

38:19.920 --> 38:21.240
<i>You'll survive.</i>

38:22.120 --> 38:23.840
<i>You must survive.</i>

38:25.000 --> 38:28.120
<i>Understand the mandala</i>
<i>and you'll be free of the curse.</i>

38:28.600 --> 38:31.880
<i>It represents the universe.</i>

38:32.480 --> 38:35.480
<i>A powerful device.</i>

38:35.840 --> 38:39.160
<i>Like every word is a mantra,</i>
<i>every symbol is a key.</i>

38:39.880 --> 38:43.440
<i>From ancient to modern times,</i> <i>you will find symbols all around us.</i>

38:47.640 --> 38:53.680
<i>They should only be placed</i>
<i>where there's a door...</i>

38:54.520 --> 38:57.400
<i>or a way to enter or leave.</i>

39:28.080 --> 39:29.520
Hey, Gaitonde.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.440
You rat.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.520
Come out.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.000
Come on.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.000
Come.

39:56.600 --> 39:57.760
I won't die.

39:59.200 --> 40:00.080
What?

40:00.640 --> 40:04.880
I'm... not going to die.

41:02.080 --> 41:06.960
<i>When I came out, Isa's men</i>
<i>were waiting for me to get revenge.</i>

41:16.160 --> 41:19.440
<i>Mathu and I against 40 of them.</i>

42:06.560 --> 42:08.520
ESCORT TEAM

42:38.080 --> 42:39.640
<i>It was certain that I'd die,</i>

42:40.240 --> 42:43.160
<i>but that voice kept my hope alive.</i>

42:44.000 --> 42:46.120
<i>It said, "You'll live, Gaitonde."</i>

42:46.840 --> 42:48.480
<i>But I needed a miracle,</i>

42:48.600 --> 42:49.880
<i>and it happened.</i>

42:50.280 --> 42:54.440
<i>Men dressed in black</i>
<i>came and took me away.</i>

42:55.080 --> 42:56.440
<i>I was half-conscious,</i>

42:56.560 --> 43:01.200
<i>but I knew I needed to meet that man,</i>

43:01.720 --> 43:06.280
<i>the one who saved my life</i>
<i>and changed my fate.</i>

43:06.840 --> 43:08.680
<i>That man was my third father.</i>

43:09.080 --> 43:12.120
<i>My third father was a master</i>
<i>at playing games.</i>

43:12.840 --> 43:15.400
<i>He played a game with me in the prison,</i>

43:15.720 --> 43:18.960
<i>and now he's playing</i>
<i>the 25-day game with Bombay.</i>

43:19.440 --> 43:21.000
He told me to leave Mumbai.

43:21.080 --> 43:23.160
Twenty-five days is all you have
to save Mumbai.

43:23.240 --> 43:25.880
Gaitonde told the cop
about the 25-day matter.

43:25.960 --> 43:27.720
The country's in danger.

43:31.040 --> 43:34.240
Everyone will die, except Trivedi.

43:35.760 --> 43:39.200
<i>I told you, Mr. Sartaj,</i>
<i>my information is never wrong.</i>

43:47.280 --> 43:48.920
Holy shit.
