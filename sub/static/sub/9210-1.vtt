01:32.509 --> 01:36.804
<i>Thirty-two teams, seven rounds,</i>

01:36.805 --> 01:40.605
<i>224 young men who, today,</i>

01:40.684 --> 01:45.405
<i>are about to become players in
the National Football League.</i>

01:45.856 --> 01:48.529
<i>A day where lives are changed,</i>

01:49.109 --> 01:51.657
<i>fates are decided,</i>

01:51.903 --> 01:54.655
<i>dynasties are born,</i>

01:54.656 --> 01:58.285
<i>and the clock is always ticking.</i>

01:58.577 --> 02:00.670
<i>Of course,</i>

02:00.912 --> 02:02.747
<i>I'm talking about...</i>

02:33.070 --> 02:34.571
Hello.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.782
Yes, sir.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.618
Sir?

02:41.620 --> 02:42.703
What is it?

02:42.704 --> 02:44.877
He's waiting in his office.

02:44.998 --> 02:46.290
What time is it?

02:46.291 --> 02:47.792
4:15.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.173
What are we gonna do with it?

02:54.174 --> 02:57.385
Well, we've gone over
this a lot, Walt.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.720
I'm really nervous about
trading away the top pick.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.846
Callahan could be huge.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.098
That's true.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.100
But it might be worth it if
someone's willing to give us

03:04.101 --> 03:06.644
their weight in gold to get him.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.770
What'd the Rams get

03:07.771 --> 03:09.480
when they traded away
number two overall

03:09.481 --> 03:11.148
to the Redskins a few years back?

03:11.149 --> 03:13.984
Three number one picks
and a number two.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.820
Well, shit, that'd work for me.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.072
Nobody's offering us that, Walt.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.620
Look.

03:20.242 --> 03:23.119
Do you want the entire city of
Seattle calling for our heads

03:23.120 --> 03:26.214
because we didn't pick Bo Callahan?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.626
Our fans know a good deal
when they see one, Tom.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.212
Which is why we're not even
gonna think about doing this

03:33.213 --> 03:34.755
unless we can find someone...

03:34.756 --> 03:36.716
Stupid enough to give
us more than he should.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.800
Exactly.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.427
So,

03:40.679 --> 03:43.853
who's the most desperate
guy you know?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.567
<i>We got a fun one today,
don't we, fellas?</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:55.818
<i>Boom, more intrigue this year</i>

03:55.819 --> 03:57.153
<i>than I can remember in a long time.</i>

03:57.154 --> 03:59.155
<i>There's no intrigue at
the number one pick.</i>

04:00.449 --> 04:02.950
<i>Bo Callahan, Wisconsin Badger,
overall number one to Seattle.</i>

04:02.951 --> 04:04.034
<i>That's gotta be a slam dunk.</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:05.327
<i>We haven't had a
quarterback like this</i>

04:05.328 --> 04:07.079
<i>enter the Draft since Andrew Luck.</i>

04:07.080 --> 04:08.456
<i>Right, so you got the
Heisman Trophy winner</i>

04:08.457 --> 04:10.040
<i>going to the Seahawks.</i>

04:10.041 --> 04:12.793
<i>But what about the other 31 teams?
What are they gonna do?</i>

04:12.794 --> 04:14.378
<i>Who you lookin' at today, Jon? Mel?</i>

04:14.379 --> 04:16.505
<i>I think it's Cleveland
at number seven.</i>

04:16.505 --> 04:18.716
<i>Sonny Weaver Jr., he's gotta have
a lot on his mind this year.</i>

04:18.716 --> 04:19.800
<i>I'm with Mel.</i>

04:19.801 --> 04:23.512
<i>As we all know, Sonny's dad, former
Browns coach Sonny Weaver Sr.,</i>

04:23.513 --> 04:26.098
<i>he's a legend in Cleveland,
he died last week.</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:29.810
<i>This kid, Ray Jennings, Heisman
Trophy finalist his senior year.</i>

04:29.811 --> 04:33.355
<i>2,159 combined yards,
running the ball,</i>

04:33.356 --> 04:35.441
<i>catching the ball, 22 touchdowns.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.109
<i>He's looking to take
it to the house.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:40.029
<i>The only downfall is this guy
got into a little skirmish.</i>

04:40.030 --> 04:43.032
<i>Assault and battery, landed
a kid in the hospital.</i>

04:43.033 --> 04:46.494
<i>But guess what? He was a
model citizen up until then.</i>

04:46.495 --> 04:48.704
<i>And you guys know me.
I'm all about values.</i>

04:48.705 --> 04:50.706
<i>And this kid's number
two on my board.</i>

04:50.707 --> 04:52.958
<i>And when I look at that
incident, I kind of say, "Look.</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:54.251
<i>"It's not medical,
it's not drug-related."</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:55.920
Good morning.

04:55.921 --> 04:57.963
<i>So if I got a kid at number two,</i>

04:57.964 --> 05:00.382
<i>and he's slidin' down
towards number seven...</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:11.853
You look nice.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.689
Are you gonna say anything to me?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.942
Anything at all?

05:19.236 --> 05:20.694
Well, it's big.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.038
It's a pretty big thing
we're talkin' about here.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.620
Look.

05:29.621 --> 05:33.249
You can understand why
this week, of all weeks,

05:33.250 --> 05:35.251
I might feel just a
little conflicted about

05:35.252 --> 05:37.378
the news I'm suddenly
gonna be a dad.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.796
I know.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.765
Shit timing.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.023
Hey!

05:59.109 --> 06:00.906
Hey!

06:05.740 --> 06:07.867
Where are you goin'?

06:07.951 --> 06:09.827
I need to go to my
place before work.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.788
Look, I'm, uh...

06:21.006 --> 06:22.507
Shit.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.513
Hey, Tom. You're up early.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.307
<i>Well, it is Draft Day.</i>

06:31.308 --> 06:32.892
<i>How're you doin'?</i>

06:32.893 --> 06:34.393
Uh... Well, I'm great.
I'm havin' a great day.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.644
How 'bout you?

06:35.645 --> 06:38.398
Well, I'm sittin' here,
eatin' my pancakes,

06:39.274 --> 06:41.233
thinkin' about movin' number one.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.526
Really?

06:42.527 --> 06:47.578
<i>Yeah, as you know, Connors did
a great job for us last year.</i>

06:47.699 --> 06:49.533
But Callahan looks like...

06:49.534 --> 06:50.743
Well, hell, Sonny, he's gonna be

06:50.744 --> 06:53.078
a franchise player for someone.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.956
You'd consider a trade?

06:55.832 --> 06:58.300
I'd consider the right one.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.799
Well, Jesus, Tom, at least act
like you called me, all right?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.259
What do you want for it?

07:07.260 --> 07:10.763
I want your first pick this year,
your first-rounder next year,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.431
and your third-rounder
the year after that.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.975
Ouch. Ouch. No, thanks.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.060
I know what it sounds like...

07:16.061 --> 07:17.895
It sounds like you're trying
to take advantage of me.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.355
I would never do that.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.106
Your seventh pick gives you, what?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.733
A running back with a rap sheet?

07:22.734 --> 07:24.234
You don't know who I'm
pickin' seven, Tom.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.403
I'm not gonna sell the
farm for one guy.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.905
Well...

07:28.365 --> 07:31.209
You should. Your farm sucks.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.077
Pick number one.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.244
Get Bo Callahan.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.329
I got a quarterback.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.831
Brian Drew?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.421
Are you talking about Brian Drew?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.168
Jesus, you're hilarious.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.795
Guy barely made it
through half the season

07:42.796 --> 07:44.713
before gettin' injured last year.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.882
I have the golden ticket, Sonny.

07:46.883 --> 07:51.263
If I give it to you, you get
to save football in Cleveland.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.357
You have 10 seconds, but
then I gotta go to work.

08:01.773 --> 08:04.321
Enjoy your pancakes, Tom.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.492
<i>Folks, I believe the
word "Clevelander"</i>

08:13.493 --> 08:17.705
<i>comes from the Latin word that means
"to have idiotic hope at all time,"</i>

08:17.706 --> 08:20.082
<i>and don't we ever?</i>

08:20.083 --> 08:24.420
<i>We don't have beaches and
beautiful weather and sunshine</i>

08:24.421 --> 08:27.006
<i>and hot babes
roller-skating all over.</i>

08:27.007 --> 08:28.716
<i>You know what we've got?</i>

08:28.717 --> 08:31.385
<i>We got our sports teams.</i>

08:31.386 --> 08:33.011
<i>And that's the only hope we have.</i>

08:33.013 --> 08:34.722
<i>Let me explain to you.</i>

08:34.722 --> 08:38.642
<i>Football was invented 20 miles
down the road in Canton, Ohio.</i>

08:38.643 --> 08:41.602
<i>This is a football town.
It's in our DNA.</i>

08:41.604 --> 08:42.980
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

08:42.981 --> 08:45.649
<i>To me, losing the team altogether,</i>

08:45.650 --> 08:50.696
<i>having the team go and move to
Baltimore, go there and win,</i>

08:50.697 --> 08:52.781
<i>that was so painful for the town.</i>

08:52.782 --> 08:56.832
<i>And then the new expansion
franchise having to come back in.</i>

08:57.245 --> 08:59.288
<i>One of the amazing
things to me is that,</i>

08:59.289 --> 09:03.292
<i>in the midst of all of this losing,
people are still hopeful that...</i>

09:03.293 --> 09:07.379
<i>- Yeah.
- ...eventually, this is going to be our year.</i>

09:07.380 --> 09:11.133
<i>Maybe to a fault, with the hope.
But that's really all we have.</i>

09:11.134 --> 09:14.344
<i>- Because this is a sports town.
- And I want Sonny Weaver to know...</i>

09:14.345 --> 09:16.138
<i>Sonny, I hope you're listening.
You better be.</i>

09:16.139 --> 09:20.601
<i>Can you please do somethin' tonight
to turn this thing around?</i>

09:20.602 --> 09:24.322
<i>- Otherwise, you will be gone.</i>

09:24.814 --> 09:25.898
Hello?

09:25.899 --> 09:28.609
Good morning, Mr. Sonny Weaver Jr.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.612
It's your number one
fan, Vontae Mack.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.447
Vontae, how'd you get this number?

09:33.448 --> 09:36.371
You gave it to me. At the Combine.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.118
It's all right if I called?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.620
That's all right.
It doesn't matter.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.456
Vontae, the Draft doesn't
start until 8:00.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.041
Where are you? New York?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.542
Naw, man.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.920
They wanted me up
there at Radio City,

09:47.921 --> 09:50.594
but I wanted to be here in
Virginia with my grams.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.718
Since she old, she
can't make that trip.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.636
So?

09:55.929 --> 09:57.846
Who you picking?

09:57.847 --> 09:58.972
If I was you,

09:58.973 --> 10:01.141
I'd take a lightning-quick
middle linebacker

10:01.142 --> 10:03.690
who can murder the gaps in a 3-4.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.062
Totally agree.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.648
You got Reggie Wilson's
number down there in Purdue?

10:07.649 --> 10:10.067
Now, I really don't
find that funny.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.445
Yeah, it's funny, Vontae. You're
just not feelin' it right now.

10:13.446 --> 10:16.615
Look, there's gonna be a lot of ups
and downs before this is all over.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.700
Try and keep a sense of humor.

10:18.701 --> 10:20.661
I ain't stupid.

10:20.662 --> 10:24.623
You don't take me at seven,
I'll drop down to the late teens.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.999
I watch the mock drafts!

10:26.000 --> 10:29.211
I know who takin' who and I
can't afford to fall that far.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.630
I can't take no
late-teens paycheck.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.550
Vontae needs a seven-pick paycheck.

10:34.551 --> 10:37.386
I got a gaggle of nephews
who need to get fed now.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.720
I'm taking 'em tumblin'.

10:38.721 --> 10:41.181
- Nephews, you love tumbling, yes or no?
- Yes!

10:41.182 --> 10:43.308
See, that's the difference
between them and me.

10:43.309 --> 10:48.814
I do not like tumblin'. Especially
if I'm tumbling 13 picks. Feel me?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.190
<i>Seventh pick...</i>

10:50.191 --> 10:52.238
Listen, I appreciate that,
Vontae, I really do.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.153
- But I gotta go.
<i>- Seventeen or 18...</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:55.871
<i>Then I got tax...</i>

11:07.125 --> 11:08.292
Y'all ready to go?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.376
Yes!

11:09.377 --> 11:11.170
- Y'all ready to tumble?
- Yes!

11:11.171 --> 11:12.421
- Yes?
- Yes!

11:12.422 --> 11:14.299
That's what I want!

11:20.305 --> 11:21.388
<i>Hello?</i>

11:21.389 --> 11:23.223
Sonny. Earl Jennings.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.102
- Hey, Earl. You're with your boy today?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:26.436 --> 11:28.395
You guys in the Big Apple?

11:28.396 --> 11:30.647
<i>Listen, Sonny.</i>

11:30.648 --> 11:33.358
It's none of my business who
you draft today, all right?

11:33.359 --> 11:36.487
Ray will play for
whoever wants him.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.906
But if you're thinkin'
of pickin' him...

11:38.907 --> 11:41.283
I need you to know that
I raised Ray right.

11:41.284 --> 11:43.744
C'mon, Earl. I know
what the papers say.

11:43.745 --> 11:46.213
<i>I'll have him explain it to you.</i>

11:46.247 --> 11:47.915
<i>What's goin' on, Mr. Weaver?</i>

11:47.916 --> 11:48.957
<i>First of all,</i>

11:48.958 --> 11:51.168
I'm not in a gang.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.462
The guys that were with
me, I grew up with them,

11:53.463 --> 11:55.756
I've known 'em since I was a kid.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.884
But the dudes we ran into,

11:58.885 --> 12:02.304
they were big dudes,
and they came at us.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.264
What was I supposed to
do, just stand there?

12:04.265 --> 12:06.558
Well, they say you whooped
on that kid pretty good, Ray.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.935
He's still in the hospital.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.394
<i>He's not a kid.</i>

12:09.395 --> 12:11.980
None of 'em were.
They were grown men.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.482
They should have known
better, Mr. Weaver.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.068
Well, that's not the point.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.866
Did you hurt your hands?

12:19.572 --> 12:20.864
<i>You need your hands, Ray.</i>

12:20.865 --> 12:22.537
I know.

12:24.327 --> 12:26.170
I just lost my head.

12:26.621 --> 12:28.122
<i>Did you find it?</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:30.165
Yes, sir.

12:30.166 --> 12:33.001
Well, good. Now hold on
to it, you understand me?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.503
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

12:35.338 --> 12:37.214
Enjoy today, Ray.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.424
You only get drafted once.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.927
Yes, sir. I appreciate
that, Mr. Weaver.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.695
Ah...

12:51.771 --> 12:53.648
Jesus...

12:54.232 --> 12:56.817
What? What'd he say?

12:58.736 --> 13:02.489
I just wanna be a Brown.
Like you, Pop.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.243
Yeah, I want that, too.

13:05.285 --> 13:09.079
But you'll play where you play.
That's the way it works.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.789
I know.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.088
I'm just nervous, man.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.087
You see that? That's
the Dungeon Drop.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.673
Kids waited an hour to take it.

13:19.674 --> 13:23.593
It's exactly 50 feet from the end
of the slide right into the pool.

13:23.594 --> 13:25.137
Huge splash.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.763
Anybody within shouting distance

13:26.764 --> 13:28.598
would've gotten completely soaked.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.767
And people pay for that.

13:30.768 --> 13:34.187
I need you to make a splash,
Sonny. We need to sell tickets.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.316
Well, I'm trying to help you do
that, Anthony, in my own way.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.443
You can help me, by
makin' a splash.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.738
And if you can't do it,
then I have to do it, and...

13:45.283 --> 13:48.832
I don't wanna have
to do that, Sonny.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.590
Just to be clear here, you're
threatening to fire me, right?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.544
Let's talk about the Draft.

13:57.545 --> 13:59.297
What do we need?

13:59.422 --> 14:02.799
I hear a quarterback is
a good thing to have.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.135
- We have Brian Drew.
- Well...

14:05.136 --> 14:08.221
Word on Drew is that he's weak in
the knees. That's what I heard.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.514
Well, that's because
you heard it from me.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.974
We were 6-and-10 last season.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.185
We were 5-and-1 until
Drew went down.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.485
And he went down because
he's weak in the knees.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.693
There's not a quarterback in
this draft after Callahan

14:21.694 --> 14:24.446
that can make a difference
to our team, all right?

14:24.447 --> 14:26.114
And we're way too far
down to get him.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.616
Okay, okay. What else?

14:27.617 --> 14:28.950
Our shiny new head coach

14:28.951 --> 14:31.203
wants a shiny new running back.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.127
Ray Jennings. He's
Cleveland royalty.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.713
I know what Penn wants.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.752
Come on, Anthony, you said
you would stay out of this.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.712
Coach Penn has a Super Bowl ring.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.214
He used to coach the
Cowboys, you know?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.924
He took over for a team
that won the Super Bowl

14:43.925 --> 14:45.926
and then proceeded to
run it into the ground.

14:45.927 --> 14:48.225
Got himself fired. Lucky for us.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.311
The Cowboys really
have great helmets.

14:51.557 --> 14:55.982
Well, Anthony, you're the owner. You
can change the helmets if you want.

14:56.145 --> 14:59.064
Look, you just gotta let me
do my job. I mean...

15:00.650 --> 15:04.654
I like Vontae Mack.
He's special. He's different.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.197
He could transform our
defense. Even as a rookie.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.201
Defense doesn't make a splash.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.584
Sonny.

15:17.667 --> 15:20.010
People pay to get wet.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.004
<i>Shameful.</i>

15:23.005 --> 15:25.507
<i>You're almost glad Coach
Weaver isn't around</i>

15:25.508 --> 15:28.218
<i>to watch his son run this
team into the ground.</i>

15:28.219 --> 15:29.344
<i>I mean, Tone, listen,</i>

15:29.345 --> 15:33.265
<i>this guy comes two years after
supposedly saving San Francisco</i>

15:33.266 --> 15:35.934
<i>and general manages us
right to a losing season.</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:40.564
<i>Then you follow that up the next
season by firing his own father.</i>

15:40.565 --> 15:43.859
<i>Coach Weaver, rest his soul.
Tone, he was football in...</i>

15:49.782 --> 15:52.576
- Have we tried everyone?
- Everyone worth asking.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.375
So far, no one's
willin' to overpay.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.210
Shit.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.958
I really thought I could
get Sonny Weaver to bite.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.501
I mean, he just lost his old man...

16:10.303 --> 16:12.020
Fleece him.

16:15.057 --> 16:18.060
Sonny! How can I help you?

16:19.979 --> 16:22.731
Okay. I'm ready to do this, Tom.

16:22.732 --> 16:29.080
Our next two number one picks and a
third-rounder for your pick today.

16:29.238 --> 16:32.616
Correction. Your next
three first-round picks.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.742
<i>What?</i>

16:33.743 --> 16:35.335
You heard me.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.583
You want me to give you

16:41.584 --> 16:44.586
the Cleveland Browns' first-round
picks for the next three years?

16:44.587 --> 16:45.962
That's right.

16:45.963 --> 16:48.131
Well, that's insane, Tom. That...

16:48.132 --> 16:49.591
That wasn't your offer.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.301
<i>Well, I changed my offer.</i>

16:51.302 --> 16:52.886
<i>Hell, we live in a different world</i>

16:52.887 --> 16:54.429
<i>than we did a couple of hours ago.</i>

16:54.430 --> 16:57.265
<i>I made you a fair offer and you
told me to enjoy my pancakes.</i>

16:57.266 --> 16:59.976
You think I'm gonna give you my
next three number one picks?

16:59.977 --> 17:02.562
<i>You're panickin', Sonny, and I
intend to take advantage of that.</i>

17:04.190 --> 17:06.112
I'm not panicking.

17:06.150 --> 17:10.530
Your next three first-round
picks. Yes or no?

17:17.453 --> 17:19.626
<i>You still there, Sonny?</i>

17:27.630 --> 17:29.339
It's fourth and forever.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.424
I'm talking fourth
and, like, miles.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.761
Fourth down and 26
yards to go, okay?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.429
Everybody's dropped back deep.

17:36.430 --> 17:38.181
Their safeties are
halfway to Abilene,

17:38.182 --> 17:40.225
thinkin' they got this thing iced.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.144
Everybody and their mother,
hell, their grandmothers,

17:43.145 --> 17:46.648
think it's gonna be the deep ball,
the Long Bomb, the Hail Mary.

17:46.649 --> 17:50.819
Instead, it's a toss out
to my man Ray Jennings.

17:50.820 --> 17:51.945
And then, boom!

17:51.946 --> 17:55.156
He gets swallowed up by this
huge, ugly nose tackle.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.992
The Hee-ha or the Ho-ha.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.828
One of those huge
Samoan kids, right?

17:59.829 --> 18:01.871
And when he looks down,
guess what he sees?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.498
Nothin'. 'Cause Ray ain't there.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.708
You know where Ray is?

18:04.709 --> 18:09.546
He teleported six feet to the
left and he's off to the races.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.840
Every poor Sooner
bastard on the field

18:11.841 --> 18:14.050
is soilin' his Pampers
tryin' to get to him.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.012
What does Ray do?
He brings it back! He cuts!

18:17.013 --> 18:20.932
Shimmy, shake-n-bake, and
hurdles over Kyle Danforth.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.393
All-American Kyle
Danforth and he's ghost.

18:23.394 --> 18:24.603
He's a good player.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.939
67 yards. Touchdown. Ballgame.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.524
I'm telling you guys.

18:29.525 --> 18:31.776
Ray's dad was a special
player for the Browns,

18:31.777 --> 18:33.862
but this kid might be even better.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.238
'Morning, Sonny.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.698
Good morning, guys.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.450
Was just tellin' Jelly
Doughnut and the guys

18:38.451 --> 18:40.076
my favorite Ray Jennings story

18:40.077 --> 18:43.456
'cause they're tellin' me
we have not yet decided.

18:43.748 --> 18:46.750
I mean, we're not seriously
considering anybody else, right?

18:46.751 --> 18:48.423
What are you doing, Sonny?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.589
I just made a trade
with the Seahawks.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.342
For?

18:57.637 --> 18:59.389
The number one pick.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.269
Oh!

19:03.768 --> 19:06.645
You got us Bo Callahan?

19:06.646 --> 19:08.938
Certainly appears that way.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.231
Ali, you here?

19:10.232 --> 19:11.733
Yes.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.903
Is this gonna screw us
up with the salary cap?

19:14.904 --> 19:17.072
Moving from seven to one?

19:17.073 --> 19:19.032
It's about another $1.5 million

19:19.033 --> 19:20.450
we weren't anticipating
for this year.

19:20.451 --> 19:23.625
Maybe an extra $5.5
million in signing bonus.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.626
We have that?

19:25.665 --> 19:27.123
We can make it work.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.126
Let me get into it.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.588
- Pretty good news, huh?
- Yeah!

19:33.589 --> 19:35.591
Number one pick?

19:37.093 --> 19:40.187
Pretty big! That's great!

19:44.767 --> 19:47.268
I thought we had a QB.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.487
Tell me, what did we give up?

19:50.356 --> 19:52.483
A number one pick this year?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.193
And?

19:54.985 --> 19:56.611
First-round pick next year.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.279
Okay, well, that's a lot, but
when you get a chance at

19:58.280 --> 19:59.781
a player like Callahan...

19:59.782 --> 20:01.825
And the year after that.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.623
Three number ones?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.288
You gave up three
consecutive first-rounders?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.624
Sonny, that's our future.

20:09.625 --> 20:10.875
No.

20:10.876 --> 20:13.049
Bo Callahan's our future.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.677
$30 million, Sonny.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.215
Excuse me?

20:17.216 --> 20:18.508
$30 million.

20:18.509 --> 20:20.218
That's what you're paying
me to coach this team

20:20.219 --> 20:21.553
for the next six years.

20:21.554 --> 20:24.806
Did it cross your mind, did you
think it might be maybe important

20:24.807 --> 20:27.401
to discuss this
decision with me first?

20:28.144 --> 20:29.394
No.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.647
It's my call.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.484
As you can infer from
Coach Peon's reaction,

20:36.485 --> 20:38.828
I just put all our
asses on the line

20:39.655 --> 20:43.455
for a kid I think we all
agree is pretty good.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.618
Until about 10 minutes ago,

20:45.619 --> 20:47.495
I don't think any of us
thought this was possible,

20:47.496 --> 20:49.664
and I seriously doubt that we have

20:49.665 --> 20:52.167
looked at him the
way we might have.

20:52.168 --> 20:55.378
That's my fault. All right,
guys? That's on me.

20:55.379 --> 20:58.506
Now that's changed. So if
we go ahead with this,

20:58.507 --> 21:00.341
if we pick him, and
find out tomorrow

21:00.342 --> 21:04.012
that he has got knee problems,
he's got bedwetting problems,

21:04.013 --> 21:07.015
or he's got goddamn OCD,
we're all gonna be fired.

21:07.016 --> 21:08.984
What's beeping?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.519
<i>Hello?</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:13.943
Am I on the big phone?

21:14.023 --> 21:17.026
<i>Yes, Anthony, you're
on the big phone.</i>

21:17.568 --> 21:19.866
And can everybody hear me?

21:20.029 --> 21:21.279
Good morning, Mr. Molina.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.906
We can hear you.

21:22.948 --> 21:26.034
Sonny! I'd like to
congratulate you.

21:26.035 --> 21:29.379
I asked you to make a
splash and you did.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.081
Is everybody still there?

21:32.082 --> 21:34.709
Anthony, how do you
already know about this?

21:34.710 --> 21:37.212
What can I tell you, my boy?
It's good to be the owner.

21:37.213 --> 21:40.216
I'm about to board my plane.
I'm headin' for New York.

21:40.382 --> 21:41.883
You're going to the Draft?

21:41.884 --> 21:44.219
No, I'm gonna see <i>Spider-Man,
Turn Off the Dark.</i>

21:44.220 --> 21:47.931
Of course I'm going to the
Draft! We got Bo Callahan!

21:47.932 --> 21:49.224
Is that it?

21:49.225 --> 21:50.726
Yes, sir.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.603
Good.

21:53.604 --> 21:55.396
Anthony? Anthony?

21:55.397 --> 21:58.316
Sonny, my assistant Heather just
arrived from the equipment manager.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.568
I had a jersey made
up for the young man.

22:00.569 --> 22:04.239
I'm gonna hand it to him myself
personally when his name is announced.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.116
Bo Callahan's gonna be
the son I never had.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.743
Anthony, you already have a son.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.917
Sonny, nice work!

22:12.248 --> 22:15.166
Well, I guess that's settled.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.502
Yeah. It may be.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.629
We're still gonna have to
take another look at this kid

22:19.630 --> 22:21.339
and everything there
is to know about him

22:21.340 --> 22:23.808
before I can feel good
about what we just risked.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.970
Meaning all of our jobs?

22:27.763 --> 22:30.181
Yes. I do understand
how important it is,

22:30.182 --> 22:31.766
but Mr. Weaver is
not here right now.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.186
So the best I can do is, I can leave
him a message and get back to you.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.729
Oh, you know, he
actually just walked in.

22:36.730 --> 22:38.189
Can you hold for one
moment, please?

22:38.190 --> 22:41.276
- Where's Ali?
- I don't know where Ali is.

22:41.277 --> 22:43.361
She's not in her office. Ali!

22:43.362 --> 22:45.114
I'm right here.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.366
What's he doing here?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.785
This is Rick. He's a new intern.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.662
Yeah. We've met before, actually.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.622
He'll be helping you today
because Rhona got mono.

22:54.623 --> 22:58.126
I need Keith and Jeremy for
salary cap troubleshooting, so...

22:58.127 --> 23:01.504
Um, I have Adam Schefter from ESPN
on the line. He heard a rumor.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.507
Oh, great. Tell Schefter to
stick his rumor up his...

23:04.508 --> 23:06.225
Sonny...

23:07.970 --> 23:11.306
All right. Then tell him I'm not
taking any media calls right now.

23:11.307 --> 23:12.390
Yes, sir.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.017
And what kind of soda did you want?

23:14.018 --> 23:15.643
I don't want a goddamn soda, Rich!

23:15.644 --> 23:17.646
Don't yell at him. Thank you, Rick.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.151
Listen, I know you're mad.

23:23.152 --> 23:24.995
I'm not mad.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.032
- And I'm sorry about the thing this morning.
- I'm not mad.

23:29.033 --> 23:31.200
I understand the situation.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.452
Whatever it is that you and I have,

23:32.453 --> 23:34.495
you've been very clear
that it wasn't...

23:34.496 --> 23:38.250
What are you talkin' about, "clear"?
I haven't been clear about anything.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.843
Well...

23:41.378 --> 23:43.676
Maybe that's the problem.

23:48.844 --> 23:52.518
So, what did you have to give
up for the number one pick?

23:56.185 --> 23:58.561
The first-round pick for
the next three years.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.605
- Wow.
- Yeah, "wow."

24:00.606 --> 24:03.274
The other one, you goat!
Get your head outta your ass!

24:03.275 --> 24:04.525
What's going on?

24:04.526 --> 24:05.735
Who the hell is this moron?

24:05.736 --> 24:07.570
This is our new intern, Rick.
What do you want?

24:07.571 --> 24:08.988
I need every tape of Callahan.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.198
I have a call for Mr. Weaver.

24:10.199 --> 24:12.533
And suddenly, every tape
of everyone is AWOL

24:12.534 --> 24:13.826
and shit-show Johnny over here

24:13.827 --> 24:15.536
doesn't have a goddamn
clue where they are!

24:15.537 --> 24:17.580
Game tape is in the
archives. Chill out.

24:17.581 --> 24:19.540
Chill out? They changed
the punch code!

24:19.541 --> 24:22.251
Okay. I will get it, okay?
I will get the Callahan tapes.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.378
For Christ sakes!

24:23.379 --> 24:25.421
Just deal with the call
and handle lunch orders.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.423
Don't ever speak to an
intern like that again.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.926
Go back in the war room. Your
tapes will be here shortly.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.804
Uh, Mr. Weaver.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.304
What?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.933
Chris Crawford is on line three.

24:36.517 --> 24:37.558
Crawford!

24:37.559 --> 24:39.394
<i>How's my favorite super-agent?</i>

24:39.395 --> 24:41.270
I'm livin' the dream, Sonny Weave.

24:41.271 --> 24:43.898
Dreamin' of a magical
wonderland called Cleveland

24:43.899 --> 24:45.733
where my golden-armed quarterback

24:45.734 --> 24:48.027
is gonna make all your
dreams come true.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.113
Yeah. How is my favorite Badger?

24:50.114 --> 24:52.490
<i>He's doing great. He's excited.</i>

24:52.491 --> 24:54.826
You know, Bo loves Coach Penn.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.079
He loves the Dawg Pound.

24:57.913 --> 25:01.249
And did I mention that Bo loves
playin' in the cold weather?

25:01.250 --> 25:03.793
'Cause Bo loves playin'
in the cold weather.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.503
And we both know it's
cold in Cleveland.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.588
<i>I'd love to talk with him, Chris.</i>

25:07.589 --> 25:09.841
He's right here. Hold on.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.599
Sonny Weaver. Cleveland.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.099
How are you, Mr. Weaver?

25:18.100 --> 25:20.810
I'm doin' fine. How are
you, son? Excited?

25:20.811 --> 25:24.110
Well, of course I am.
It's an excitin' day. I can't lie.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.525
Good, good. Well, try and
enjoy this part if you can.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.694
<i>You only get drafted once.</i>

25:29.695 --> 25:32.030
Well, thank you very much,
sir. I appreciate that.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.114
Got a question for you, Bo.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.458
Anything, Mr. Weaver. Fire away.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.624
How important is winning to you?

25:38.954 --> 25:40.455
Excuse me?

25:41.498 --> 25:42.874
Well, I've seen all the tape on you

25:42.875 --> 25:44.208
and talked to everyone
that matters,

25:44.209 --> 25:46.544
but that's the thing
I still don't know.

25:46.545 --> 25:49.298
<i>How important is winning to you?</i>

25:49.798 --> 25:52.471
Well, winning is everything, sir.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.888
Everyone says that, Bo.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.357
I suppose they do, sir.

25:59.475 --> 26:01.809
<i>Look, I don't know
what else to tell you.</i>

26:01.810 --> 26:04.904
<i>Winning is the only thing
that matters to me.</i>

26:07.983 --> 26:11.402
Oh, and by the way, I'd like to offer
my condolences for your father.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.863
Thanks, Bo. Thanks for saying that.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.656
Thank Chris for me.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.075
Talk to you later, pal.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.327
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Weaver.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.120
Look forward to meetin' you, sir.

26:23.832 --> 26:24.916
Great job.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.000
Was I all right?

26:26.001 --> 26:28.219
- Cleveland! Yeah.
- Cleveland.

26:31.340 --> 26:32.841
Thank you.

26:35.552 --> 26:36.677
Ali?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.689
Great.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.396
Hi, Mom.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.566
You sold a cow for magic beans.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.026
<i>What?</i>

26:52.027 --> 26:54.737
You could have stole
Ray Jennings at seven!

26:54.738 --> 26:57.698
How does the entire world
already know about this, Mom?

26:57.699 --> 27:00.034
Because Vontae Mack
just tweeted it.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.369
He tweeted it?

27:02.538 --> 27:04.539
Yeah. Here.

27:04.540 --> 27:08.709
"Agent just called. Browns
trade for number one.

27:08.710 --> 27:12.922
<i>"Sorry, Cleve.
You get Bo, no Vontae.</i>

27:12.923 --> 27:15.551
<i>"Dumb move."</i>

27:15.884 --> 27:17.556
You're on Twitter?

27:17.970 --> 27:19.562
You're not?

27:19.638 --> 27:23.062
I'm sorry, Sonny.
Is this a bad time?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.726
I gotta go, Mom.

27:25.727 --> 27:28.229
This is the Draft Analysis
we've all been working on

27:28.230 --> 27:29.272
for the last two months.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.821
Fire! Ali! Fire!

27:31.900 --> 27:33.901
- Ali! Fire!
- Did you hear that?

27:33.902 --> 27:36.780
I'm coming. God!

27:45.122 --> 27:47.331
Can I get you gentlemen
some coffee?

27:47.332 --> 27:48.416
Love some.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.959
Light and sweet, honey. Thanks.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.758
Yeah, I'm not getting
you idiots anything.

27:54.006 --> 27:58.134
I like her. Little Miss Salary Cap.
She's a sweetheart.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.260
Yeah, she's the best.

27:59.261 --> 28:01.434
Why am I here, Sonny?

28:01.513 --> 28:03.431
Because Molina thinks you
coached the Cowboys.

28:03.432 --> 28:04.807
I did coach the Cowboys.

28:04.808 --> 28:07.356
And I think you were
a bad babysitter.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.315
You know, my wife loved
livin' in Dallas, Sonny.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.108
It's a rich town
full of fancy people

28:14.109 --> 28:15.943
and she likes that kind of thing.

28:15.944 --> 28:18.029
So she wasn't exactly
thrilled when I said,

28:18.030 --> 28:21.699
"Hey, baby, pack your bags.
We're moving to Cleveland."

28:21.700 --> 28:23.618
Well, there's fancy
people here, too.

28:23.619 --> 28:24.994
No.

28:24.995 --> 28:27.496
There's really not.
Which is okay by me.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.874
But I dragged my pretty
wife to this town

28:29.875 --> 28:32.084
because this city
deserves a championship

28:32.085 --> 28:34.503
and I'm the guy that
can deliver it.

28:34.504 --> 28:35.588
Well, then we're on
the same page, Vince.

28:35.589 --> 28:36.672
Oh, yeah?

28:36.673 --> 28:38.174
Then keep me in the loop.

28:38.175 --> 28:40.009
There is no loop. All right?

28:40.010 --> 28:42.762
There's me doing my
job, you doing yours.

28:42.763 --> 28:44.222
Your job is to coach
the team I give you.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.473
They do it different in Dallas?

28:45.474 --> 28:49.103
Yeah, they do. They win. A lot.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.648
I had my choice of teams to coach,
Sonny, and I chose this team, okay?

28:53.649 --> 28:56.067
I chose to coach this team.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.903
Not the team you're puttin'
together in your head, on the fly

28:58.904 --> 29:00.655
'cause your old man died last week

29:00.656 --> 29:02.829
and you're tapping
one of your execs.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.992
What did you just say?

29:04.993 --> 29:07.871
I'm sorry. Is that
supposed to be a secret?

29:09.665 --> 29:14.090
You know, around here, we called
my "old man" Coach Weaver.

29:14.544 --> 29:17.421
And yes, my father died last week.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.173
So the next time you
refer to his name,

29:19.174 --> 29:20.841
next time you say it, at
least, in front of me,

29:20.842 --> 29:24.846
you say it with some goddamn
reverence, because he earned it.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.228
Fair enough?

29:30.686 --> 29:33.780
Keep your legs up now.

29:33.855 --> 29:36.274
Don't even think about it.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.910
Sonny Weaver Jr.

29:43.031 --> 29:44.748
<i>Vontae.</i>

29:45.534 --> 29:47.451
I'm disappointed in
you, Mr. Weaver.

29:47.452 --> 29:48.577
Let me tell you something, Vontae,

29:48.578 --> 29:49.704
and I don't have a lot of time,

29:49.705 --> 29:52.299
so I want you to listen
to me carefully, okay?

29:52.541 --> 29:54.375
- Are you listening?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

29:54.376 --> 29:55.876
Don't Twitter.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.546
For the love of Jesus, just stop.

29:58.547 --> 30:02.508
Delete your profile. Get off the web.
Do not do this to yourself.

30:02.509 --> 30:04.260
I don't know why you
care what I do.

30:04.261 --> 30:06.220
I can do whatever I want. Right?

30:06.221 --> 30:07.888
Of course you can, Vontae,

30:07.889 --> 30:09.473
but every GM in the league
has now read your tweet,

30:09.474 --> 30:11.642
or whatever they call them,

30:11.643 --> 30:13.894
and they've all made a mental
note that Vontae Mack,

30:13.895 --> 30:17.565
however prodigiously talented, is a
guy who likes to talk, all right?

30:17.566 --> 30:19.066
Who likes to spread rumors,

30:19.067 --> 30:20.735
who's more than willing
to announce to the world

30:20.736 --> 30:24.456
any inane thought that
passes through his head.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.365
And be it your God-given
right or not,

30:26.366 --> 30:27.825
Vontae, GM's hate
that shit, all right?

30:27.826 --> 30:28.951
We hate it.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.911
You made a mistake, Mr. Weaver.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.663
No, Vontae. I made a deal.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.415
And you're gonna be a
great player in the NFL

30:34.416 --> 30:36.042
if you don't manage
to sabotage yourself

30:36.043 --> 30:37.626
between now and the
end of this day.

30:37.627 --> 30:40.254
Now, now, now, now,
that boy you wanna take,

30:40.255 --> 30:43.090
that there is a mistake, Callahan.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.592
Callahan's a poser.

30:44.593 --> 30:45.676
Yeah.

30:45.677 --> 30:50.097
And what do you know that every
scout and coach on Earth does not?

30:50.098 --> 30:53.317
I know he got sacked
12 times last year.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.853
No. It was 11. It was 11 times.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.689
Yeah, well, four of 'em
were mine. In one game.

30:58.690 --> 31:01.025
Yeah, I remember.
I saw your highlight reel.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.444
I also remember that he beat you.

31:03.445 --> 31:05.447
Watch it again.

31:05.489 --> 31:08.199
Don't watch me. Watch him.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.494
Watch me sack him four
times in one game.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.794
Then watch what happens after.

31:16.458 --> 31:19.052
Watch what happens after what?

31:19.461 --> 31:21.508
Just watch.

31:26.635 --> 31:28.808
Jesus Christ.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.022
Jordan, come here.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.077
Do it like you did it at home.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.370
Yeah! Nice, nice, nice!

31:53.495 --> 31:54.912
'Morning, boss man.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.665
Tony Bagel. How's my
favorite strength coach?

31:57.666 --> 31:59.333
Hey, boss. Boss.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.085
Did you hear about Brian Drew?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.336
No, what about him?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.422
He came in here yesterday,
did a little workout.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.382
Guess how much he squatted?

32:06.383 --> 32:07.591
He's not supposed to be squattin'.

32:07.592 --> 32:08.926
Four hundred!

32:08.927 --> 32:10.886
Four bills! I know!

32:10.887 --> 32:13.347
And what's even more
impressive is his arm.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.057
Your star wide
receiver Andre Bello's

32:15.058 --> 32:16.642
been tellin' me about
those secret workouts

32:16.643 --> 32:18.602
they've been doin'
together all winter.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.271
You know about those?

32:20.272 --> 32:21.439
Yeah.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.025
Yeah, well, Andre thinks Brian can
throw a good 15 yards deeper now.

32:25.026 --> 32:28.195
I didn't believe it until
I saw what he benched.

32:28.196 --> 32:29.405
What did he bench?

32:29.406 --> 32:32.783
He benched 250, 25 times.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.035
Just boom-boom!

32:35.036 --> 32:39.540
Translation, Brian Drew's in
the best shape of his life.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.208
- Good work.
- Yeah!

32:41.209 --> 32:43.043
Let's go for it, boy. C'mon!

32:43.044 --> 32:44.420
Pop it!

32:44.421 --> 32:47.219
Snap it up! Yeah! Nice!

33:28.757 --> 33:31.425
- This one...
- Yeah... Oh my God, she's hot.

33:31.426 --> 33:32.551
I like the one in the red.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.599
She's a babe!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.806
How we doin' on Callahan?

33:37.807 --> 33:39.266
You mean in the
weakness department?

33:39.267 --> 33:42.061
Yeah, well, he has a weakness
for banging hot chicks, Sonny.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.771
I mean, look, he has
a whole website

33:43.772 --> 33:44.939
dedicated to all the
chicks he's smashed.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.783
All right, c'mon.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.320
Somebody's gotta have something.

33:51.321 --> 33:54.615
He doesn't speak French real
good. He got a C-minus.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.158
And he used to bite
his fingernails,

33:56.159 --> 33:57.701
but then wait for it,
now he doesn't anymore.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.495
But, Sonny, really, how
many chicks do you think

33:59.496 --> 34:02.289
a guy like that sleeps with,
per week, on average?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.291
We were thinkin' 20.
Minimum. Minimum.

34:04.292 --> 34:05.376
I say 10.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.962
That's 1.5 per day,
which makes sense.

34:07.963 --> 34:09.922
- 2.5 sounds exorbitant.
- Listen, man.

34:09.922 --> 34:11.674
Speaking as a former college
quarterback myself...

34:11.675 --> 34:12.757
Division II.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.510
I say he averages,
like, three per day.

34:14.511 --> 34:16.888
Right? That's one in the mornin'...

34:19.808 --> 34:21.850
I'm trying very hard
to not completely

34:21.851 --> 34:24.186
lose my shit on all
three of you right now,

34:24.187 --> 34:26.655
but you're not makin' it easy.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.734
Sonny, so far, he's still the
best prospect we've ever seen.

34:30.735 --> 34:31.985
Easily, Sonny.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.987
We've been looking, Sonny. I swear.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.906
We couldn't find anything
before and we can't now.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.324
No other team could either.

34:37.324 --> 34:39.243
If Callahan can't play
football, nobody can.

34:39.244 --> 34:43.418
I get it. I get it. But
look, nobody's perfect.

34:43.665 --> 34:47.043
Everybody has something.
Even the great ones. Right?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.295
They said that Montana
was too small,

34:49.295 --> 34:51.380
that he'd get hurt,
he'd get banged up,

34:51.380 --> 34:54.600
but that didn't seem
to matter, did it?

34:56.428 --> 34:59.179
<i>A lot of people said that
Elway was too strong,</i>

34:59.180 --> 35:02.850
<i>that he threw too hard,
didn't have touch,</i>

35:02.851 --> 35:05.274
<i>but that didn't seem to
matter either, did it?</i>

35:06.730 --> 35:08.188
<i>And pretty much everyone agreed</i>

35:08.189 --> 35:09.565
<i>that Peyton didn't
have the arm strength,</i>

35:09.566 --> 35:10.774
<i>that he couldn't throw deep.</i>

35:10.775 --> 35:12.860
But somehow, none of
it seemed to matter.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.533
You get where I'm going here, guys?

35:16.281 --> 35:19.033
We need to find out what Bo
Callahan's "something" is.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.035
Then figure out if
it matters or not.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.413
All right? Figure out if it's
somethin' we can live with.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.632
- We're on it, Sonny.
- All right, Sonny.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.215
Yo, I bookmarked that page.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.428
<i>I really like this
quarter outta Oklahoma.</i>

35:35.050 --> 35:37.551
His Combine scores
were off the charts.

35:43.725 --> 35:45.059
Hey, Sonny.

35:45.060 --> 35:47.062
<i>What's up?</i>

35:48.521 --> 35:50.230
Got a question for you,
Tom. Straight up.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.273
<i>Sure.</i>

35:51.274 --> 35:53.401
Why'd you make the deal?

35:54.569 --> 35:56.111
What?

35:56.112 --> 35:59.490
This morning, for Callahan.
Why did you make that deal?

35:59.491 --> 36:01.700
The same reason you did.

36:01.701 --> 36:03.452
It's the best thing
for my franchise.

36:03.453 --> 36:05.412
<i>What knock did you
find on Callahan?</i>

36:05.413 --> 36:06.622
Bo! We want Bo!

36:06.623 --> 36:08.500
Son of a bitch.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.668
You all right, Tom?
You seem distracted.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.252
We didn't find anything on him.

36:12.253 --> 36:13.754
I'm sure you guys haven't either.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.340
Come on, I already made the
trade. I'm living with that, Tom.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.508
<i>I'm not gonna hold it against you.</i>

36:17.509 --> 36:18.676
Tom must go!

36:18.677 --> 36:20.344
- Tom must go!
<i>- I'd just appreciate it if you could...</i>

36:20.345 --> 36:22.267
Sonny, I gotta go.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.599
Hey.

36:25.600 --> 36:28.774
I got you Bo Callahan's
scouting reports.

36:30.271 --> 36:32.356
Dave, come here.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.655
Does that look like me?

36:39.239 --> 36:41.036
- What are you doing?
- Just...

36:47.163 --> 36:50.883
I need two seconds with you in
a place that isn't out there.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.719
Okay.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.889
I don't like what's
happening between us.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.674
Seeing you all day,
walk the other way,

36:58.675 --> 37:00.092
watching you drive
away this morning,

37:00.093 --> 37:01.594
it's killing me.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.807
Look, I know I've disappointed you.

37:06.141 --> 37:09.394
And maybe that's not even
a strong enough word.

37:09.728 --> 37:12.020
If I didn't handle, if I
didn't have the right words

37:12.021 --> 37:14.314
that you needed to
hear, then I'm...

37:14.315 --> 37:16.483
Look, Sonny, you don't
need to do this.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.985
Let me finish.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.319
Men are supposed to step up.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.988
And in the middle of
everything that's going on,

37:20.989 --> 37:22.531
I didn't get it right, all right?

37:22.532 --> 37:24.032
I didn't get all gooey.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.409
I didn't jump up and want to know

37:25.410 --> 37:26.702
what color to paint the bedroom,

37:26.703 --> 37:27.828
you know, blue or pink.

37:27.829 --> 37:30.497
And I wish I was one
of those kind of guys

37:30.498 --> 37:33.459
that know how to make
the wallpaper line up.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.169
The Home Depot
Dads-of-the-Year types

37:35.170 --> 37:38.005
that make the rest of
us look like assholes.

37:38.006 --> 37:41.601
Those guys are not the reason
you look like an asshole.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.265
So I didn't react the
perfect way this morning.

37:48.266 --> 37:50.601
I shouldn't be penalized for that.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.025
I know that, Sonny.

37:54.898 --> 37:58.117
I'm not the Mom-of-the-Year
type either.

37:58.693 --> 38:02.279
I don't know how to pack a lunch.
I've never changed a diaper.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.408
And God help me, the one thing I
do understand, Sonny, is football.

38:05.409 --> 38:06.950
That's me.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.546
I'm action-oriented.
I'm passionate.

38:10.622 --> 38:14.217
I'm a Cleveland girl,
and I am football.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.712
Maybe more than you.
I wasn't born into this game.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.681
I had to fight my way in.

38:28.389 --> 38:31.767
Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
I can come back.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.060
I'm gonna come back.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.653
What do you need, Rick?

38:36.231 --> 38:38.574
Brian Drew just
trashed your office.

38:41.486 --> 38:42.569
What?

38:42.570 --> 38:43.612
I told him you were busy

38:43.613 --> 38:47.658
and he told me to have
intercourse with my mother.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.245
Which... You know, she passed
away, so... I didn't tell him that.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.997
Anyway, he got really mad and
started throwing stuff around,

38:53.998 --> 38:56.751
and then he said he was gonna
go down to the locker room.

38:56.835 --> 39:00.420
After all that rehab, you're just gonna
quit? You're just gonna walk away?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.922
C'mon, Brian. Don't listen
to Coach. Don't leave.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.090
I know what's goin' on here.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.685
Then just compete with him!
Beat him out!

39:14.102 --> 39:15.435
Did you trash my office?

39:15.436 --> 39:16.770
Trade me.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.814
Did you just trash my office?

39:18.815 --> 39:20.983
Yeah. I'm upset.

39:20.984 --> 39:22.150
Well, I don't care if you're upset.

39:22.151 --> 39:23.944
If you're upset, call
your agent, all right?

39:23.945 --> 39:26.154
Let him have this conversation.
That's what he's there for.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.657
No, Sonny. You're gonna talk to me.
Man-to-man. You owe me that.

39:28.658 --> 39:29.992
I owe you?

39:29.993 --> 39:31.118
I drafted you.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.578
Your dad drafted me.

39:32.579 --> 39:34.456
No, Drew, I drafted you.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.541
I may have been in San Francisco,

39:37.542 --> 39:40.670
but my dad wasn't even looking
at you until I told him to.

39:40.962 --> 39:44.298
Yeah, and when your knee crapped
out and no one wanted you,

39:44.299 --> 39:45.591
I still extended your contract,

39:45.592 --> 39:46.800
and I think I even
gave you a raise,

39:46.801 --> 39:48.518
because I believed in you.

39:48.636 --> 39:50.729
Then why pick Callahan?

39:51.222 --> 39:53.019
You know why.

39:53.558 --> 39:55.651
Then trade me.

39:57.312 --> 39:59.980
I'm gonna do what's
best for the team.

39:59.981 --> 40:03.901
I've been in this league for eight
seasons. I've been to the playoffs.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.904
I know the system that Penn wants to
run and I know I can make it work.

40:06.905 --> 40:10.657
I've busted my ass this off-season.
I set the bar high.

40:10.658 --> 40:14.002
I'm in great shape.
I feel 10 years younger.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.705
I'm tellin' you,
man, I swear to you,

40:16.706 --> 40:20.050
the best thing for this
team, this season, is me.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.919
Are you finished?

40:21.920 --> 40:23.421
No.

40:23.504 --> 40:25.221
Well, get finished.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.674
And then get back to work.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.178
If I trade you, I trade you.
And if I don't, I don't.

40:31.179 --> 40:34.681
Do yourself a favor. Worry about
Brian. Don't worry about Bo.

40:34.682 --> 40:37.559
And definitely, most absolutely
goddamn importantly,

40:37.560 --> 40:39.853
do not bother me with your
shit right now, Brian.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.197
I'm workin' here!

41:04.212 --> 41:05.713
Ali!

41:07.382 --> 41:08.974
Ali!

41:11.219 --> 41:12.719
Did you hear me, Rick?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.388
I heard you. Yeah.

41:14.389 --> 41:15.764
Do you think Ali heard me?

41:15.765 --> 41:17.892
No, I don't think so. No.

41:19.102 --> 41:21.070
Good answer.

41:21.479 --> 41:25.232
Women are tricky. Problem is,
they're smarter than us.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.484
Yeah. Women, they're like...

41:52.593 --> 41:53.844
<i>This is Sonny.</i>

41:53.845 --> 41:56.179
Hey, Sonny. It's Pete
Begler with the Chiefs.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.932
<i>Hey, Pete. What's up?</i>

41:57.974 --> 42:00.100
Well, we're in the market for a QB,

42:00.101 --> 42:02.185
and now that you have number one,

42:02.186 --> 42:04.939
I was wondering if Brian
Drew's available.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.649
I don't know. Haven't
made up my mind yet.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.109
Is he healthy?

42:09.110 --> 42:12.821
Well, if you're askin' about his
knee, it's stronger than ever.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.532
He's throwin' the ball a good 15
yards farther down the field.

42:15.533 --> 42:17.659
Okay. Just confirming.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.287
His agent sent over a tape of Drew
working out during the off-season.

42:20.288 --> 42:22.122
We like what we see.

42:22.123 --> 42:24.624
He did? That's great.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.843
You seem surprised.

42:28.296 --> 42:31.140
Why would I be surprised?

42:31.632 --> 42:34.384
Okay, Sonny. You don't have
to play games with me.

42:34.385 --> 42:37.809
What do you want for him?
I'm all ears. Let's talk.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.641
Pete, we're still working
out some stuff over here.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.934
Can I get back to you?

42:42.935 --> 42:44.144
Okay.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.897
Thanks.

42:52.528 --> 42:55.072
Hey, Ali. How're you doin'?

42:55.073 --> 42:56.656
Are you as jacked as everyone else

42:56.657 --> 42:58.241
around here about
gettin' the first pick?

42:58.242 --> 43:00.836
I don't really get jacked,
I just manage the cap.

43:00.912 --> 43:01.995
Uh-huh.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.873
How does a girl like you
get in this game anyway?

43:04.874 --> 43:06.249
Law school.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.709
Lawyer.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.669
So you don't get excited
about anything.

43:09.670 --> 43:10.712
If I do my job

43:10.713 --> 43:12.672
and we haven't spent
more than $125 million

43:12.673 --> 43:14.591
<i>on players by the time
the season starts,</i>

43:14.592 --> 43:16.685
I get excited.

43:18.012 --> 43:20.059
Mind if I sit down?

43:20.181 --> 43:22.604
- I'm busy.
- Won't take long.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.945
I could use your help.

43:25.978 --> 43:27.821
Mmm?

43:29.607 --> 43:30.857
The Browns brought me to Cleveland

43:30.858 --> 43:34.453
so that everybody could
get one of these.

43:35.905 --> 43:37.364
How is it that the ultimate prize

43:37.365 --> 43:39.533
in the most macho
sport ever invented

43:39.534 --> 43:42.036
is a piece of jewelry?

43:42.370 --> 43:48.375
Yeah. Well, be that as it may,
I need some draft picks back, okay?

43:48.376 --> 43:50.293
'Cause there's been some
pretty foolish moves

43:50.294 --> 43:52.387
made by your boyfriend.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.049
- My boyfriend?
- Please.

43:56.050 --> 43:58.927
You have his ear. I don't.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.887
Talk to him. It's not about me.

44:00.888 --> 44:03.311
It's about the people of Cleveland.

44:04.767 --> 44:07.060
You don't think Callahan's legit?

44:07.061 --> 44:09.729
I think Callahan might be the
best prospect in the Draft.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.190
But I hate rookie quarterbacks.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.359
They're stupid and they're scared.

44:14.360 --> 44:16.570
- Not the good ones.
- We already got a good one.

44:16.571 --> 44:20.240
His name is Brian Drew. He can
run my offense like a pro.

44:20.241 --> 44:22.742
So I'm tryin' to
figure out why I gotta

44:22.743 --> 44:24.327
give away the future
of the franchise

44:24.328 --> 44:26.705
and then sit around trying
to teach some rookie,

44:26.706 --> 44:28.498
I don't know, everything, you know?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.750
I'm talking shifts,
plays, protections,

44:30.751 --> 44:32.961
snap counts, alerts,
check-with-me's,

44:32.962 --> 44:36.464
Double X, jet, ice cream, 36, counter
naked waggle at 16-9 Tennessee Free.

44:36.465 --> 44:37.966
Know what I'm sayin'?

44:37.967 --> 44:41.141
Don't patronize me. You know
I know what you're saying.

44:42.013 --> 44:45.599
I dedicated my life to
this sport, just like you.

44:45.600 --> 44:49.195
And, no, I will not
speak to Sonny for you.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.871
<i>Bo Ridley Callahan.</i>

44:59.947 --> 45:01.281
He's an only child.

45:01.282 --> 45:04.451
His mom's a homemaker, his father's
a medical malpractice lawyer.

45:04.452 --> 45:05.785
He's made some money.

45:05.786 --> 45:08.830
Pays his taxes. He's got three
years left on his mortgage.

45:08.831 --> 45:12.292
The kid's pretty vanilla. Belonged
to a few clubs in high school.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.794
He had a walk-on role
in <i>Damn Yankees.</i>

45:14.795 --> 45:17.839
He was on the honor roll from
junior high through college.

45:17.840 --> 45:20.508
Kept his nose clean,
he worked out and...

45:20.509 --> 45:22.886
Well, you know, he threw a football

45:22.887 --> 45:26.806
better than anybody in the great
states of Washington or Wisconsin.

45:26.807 --> 45:28.058
But?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.184
How do you know there's a "but"?

45:29.185 --> 45:32.312
Because you're an
unoriginal bastard, Ralph.

45:32.313 --> 45:34.564
So, go on. But...

45:34.565 --> 45:37.693
But during his final
year at Wisconsin,

45:37.818 --> 45:41.821
he had a big dinner for his 21st
birthday at some restaurant.

45:41.822 --> 45:45.200
Locals find out who the dinner's
for, and they start filin' in.

45:45.201 --> 45:47.160
Things get outta control.

45:47.161 --> 45:49.120
Manager called the
cops when somebody

45:49.121 --> 45:51.581
broke in his office
and stole some money.

45:51.582 --> 45:53.667
Of course, none of
this is Bo's fault.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.418
'Course.

45:55.419 --> 45:56.920
But...

45:57.171 --> 46:01.591
But the cops came and they took
everybody's name regardless.

46:01.592 --> 46:05.220
It was a few hundred people.
Standard operating procedure.

46:05.221 --> 46:06.722
But...

46:08.599 --> 46:10.684
Ask me who wasn't there.

46:10.685 --> 46:12.686
Who wasn't there, Ralph?

46:12.687 --> 46:14.860
Any of his teammates.

46:16.190 --> 46:20.285
None of his teammates came to the
poor guy's birthday party, Sonny.

46:32.790 --> 46:33.957
Dick Moore.

46:33.958 --> 46:36.376
<i>Hey, Coach. Sonny Weaver.</i>

46:36.377 --> 46:39.254
You're about to be
a very happy man.

46:39.255 --> 46:42.257
Bo Callahan's some
of my finest work.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.217
What can you tell me about him?

46:44.218 --> 46:48.054
I can tell you what I just told
you, he's some of my finest work.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.556
Anything else?

46:49.557 --> 46:51.274
You have the tapes.

46:51.392 --> 46:53.601
He's the real deal, Sonny.

46:53.602 --> 46:56.230
Don't overthink this like
your dad would have.

46:56.480 --> 46:58.482
<i>No offense.</i>

46:58.899 --> 47:01.276
<i>Look. I love Bo.</i>

47:01.319 --> 47:03.153
My coaches love him.

47:03.154 --> 47:05.322
The cheerleaders love him.
The fans love him.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.574
<i>Everyone loves him.</i>

47:07.575 --> 47:10.794
Then how come none of his teammates
went to his birthday party?

47:12.330 --> 47:14.673
Are you kiddin' me with this?

47:14.832 --> 47:17.167
Seems relevant.

47:17.168 --> 47:19.586
You want to tear this
kid down, or what?

47:19.587 --> 47:22.089
No, I'd just like your take on it.

47:22.173 --> 47:24.090
I find it odd that
nobody on the team

47:24.091 --> 47:26.760
was at their teammate's
21st birthday party.

47:26.761 --> 47:30.430
I don't know, Sonny. What do
you think's more plausible?

47:30.431 --> 47:32.766
That nobody on an 85-person squad

47:32.767 --> 47:35.645
attended a party
thrown by the captain?

47:35.686 --> 47:37.854
Or could it be that when
the cops got to the place

47:37.855 --> 47:40.899
and realized that my boys
had done nothin' wrong,

47:40.900 --> 47:43.360
decided not to take down
any of the players' names

47:43.361 --> 47:44.444
because they didn't wanna jam up

47:44.445 --> 47:47.039
a bunch of good kids
for doin' nothin'?

47:48.657 --> 47:51.125
<i>Oh, wait. Wait a minute.</i>

47:51.285 --> 47:53.128
Your theory seems right.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.129
Bo Callahan.

47:55.373 --> 47:59.719
Bo Callahan hasn't got any friends.

48:00.044 --> 48:02.296
Good luck with the Draft today.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.842
C'mon, you guys. You're
lookin' pathetic.

48:41.335 --> 48:42.669
Hey, Max.

48:42.670 --> 48:45.172
Hey, Sonny. Hope you're holdin' up.

48:45.381 --> 48:47.599
I got an offer for number one.

48:47.716 --> 48:50.685
Yeah? Well, I'm all ears.
What do you have in mind?

48:50.886 --> 48:52.429
Okay, here's what we got.

48:52.430 --> 48:55.181
Maurice Castillo, Antonio Taylor,

48:55.182 --> 48:58.268
our first-rounder next year
and the year after that.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.728
<i>That's two number ones,
a blue-chip running back...</i>

49:00.729 --> 49:02.355
I know who they are, Max.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.779
Then you know it's a fair offer.

49:08.404 --> 49:09.905
I'm intrigued.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.708
Good. Let's make a deal.

49:14.452 --> 49:16.703
- Well, you gotta give me some time.
- Time?

49:16.704 --> 49:19.414
Sonny, time's one thing
neither one of us have.

49:19.415 --> 49:20.623
Make the deal.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.216
Give me an hour.

49:22.877 --> 49:24.970
We'll give you half that.

49:31.635 --> 49:32.927
What's up?

49:32.928 --> 49:35.138
I just got off the
phone with Max Stone.

49:35.139 --> 49:37.557
Yeah? How are things in Buffalo?

49:37.558 --> 49:39.058
Well, I guess you
didn't ask him then,

49:39.059 --> 49:41.186
when you called him behind my back.

49:41.353 --> 49:42.812
Max is an old friend of mine.

49:42.813 --> 49:45.440
He calls me up to congratulate
us on the Callahan thing

49:45.441 --> 49:47.609
and I express my
opinions on the matter.

49:47.610 --> 49:49.908
He call you, or you call him?

49:50.070 --> 49:52.405
It's such a crazy day.
Who remembers?

49:52.406 --> 49:53.865
Yeah, well, how 'bout
try and remember this,

49:53.866 --> 49:56.493
I can and I will fire your ass.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.995
Then do it, Sonny.

50:02.750 --> 50:04.083
You actually think
I'm gonna give up

50:04.084 --> 50:06.127
Bo Callahan for
Taylor and Castillo?

50:06.128 --> 50:08.171
Hmm? Maurice Castillo?

50:08.172 --> 50:09.672
And draft picks, okay?

50:09.673 --> 50:10.757
Don't forget the
draft picks, Sonny.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.056
You do remember what
those are, right?

50:15.137 --> 50:17.514
All right. Look. It's...

50:17.515 --> 50:19.599
On the surface, it's not
a terrible trade, but

50:19.600 --> 50:21.768
why do you think we
need to do this now?

50:21.769 --> 50:24.103
Because you burned up any currency
this team had this morning.

50:24.104 --> 50:25.980
Now you have the opportunity
to build it back up.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.607
And I don't know what your
problem is with Maurice.

50:27.608 --> 50:28.983
He's a beast.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.818
Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane.

50:30.819 --> 50:32.779
Your opinion. He
plays in my system.

50:32.780 --> 50:33.821
He doesn't block!

50:33.822 --> 50:35.782
I don't need him to block.
I need him to run.

50:35.783 --> 50:37.700
Which he does, like
a bat outta hell.

50:37.701 --> 50:40.453
Which takes the pressure
off my offense, okay?

50:40.454 --> 50:45.050
I got 52 Tarzans in that locker
room. I could use a Jane.

50:48.879 --> 50:52.383
You should at least seriously
consider what I'm saying.

50:55.719 --> 50:59.013
All right. Get me the
numbers on all their guys.

50:59.014 --> 51:00.807
We got about 25 minutes
to see what's what.

51:00.808 --> 51:02.275
Great.

51:12.861 --> 51:14.946
Mr. Molina. How are you?

51:16.907 --> 51:19.075
Very good.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.544
Excellent. That's good.
Good to see you.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.667
I'll take you inside.

51:27.251 --> 51:28.877
Right up here.

51:30.421 --> 51:31.754
Sonny call you yet?

51:31.755 --> 51:33.172
Oh, not yet.

51:33.173 --> 51:34.215
What's he doing?

51:34.216 --> 51:35.925
Well, I'm sure he's
gonna call soon.

51:35.926 --> 51:38.678
These are our team reps.
This is Wyndham. This is Phil.

51:38.679 --> 51:40.513
- Mr. Anthony Molina.
- How do you do?

51:40.514 --> 51:42.348
- Sir.
- How do you do?

51:42.349 --> 51:43.516
Right up here.

51:43.517 --> 51:44.601
I'm not sitting here.

51:44.602 --> 51:45.685
Oh, no, of course you're not.

51:45.686 --> 51:47.604
You're with the Commissioner,
up in his lounge.

51:47.605 --> 51:50.699
Here, let me show you the way.
Let's go around here.

51:52.985 --> 51:54.702
He's even better.

51:55.029 --> 51:57.202
Mr. Commissioner?

51:57.239 --> 51:58.740
Hey, Anthony. How are you doing?

51:58.741 --> 52:00.908
What are you doing in my lounge?

52:00.909 --> 52:03.620
You guys sure made tonight
a lot more exciting.

52:03.621 --> 52:04.746
Thanks for inviting me in.

52:04.747 --> 52:05.955
Enjoy it. Good luck.

52:05.956 --> 52:07.582
- Will do.
- Okay.

52:07.583 --> 52:09.876
Can we talk football?

52:09.877 --> 52:11.711
Just football, for 30 seconds?

52:11.712 --> 52:13.464
We can always talk football.

52:15.966 --> 52:18.217
There's a deal on the
table from Buffalo.

52:18.218 --> 52:19.970
I heard.

52:21.055 --> 52:22.555
What's the war room think?

52:22.556 --> 52:24.182
Split.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.142
Penn wants me to do it.

52:26.143 --> 52:27.895
But you don't?

52:27.978 --> 52:29.062
I don't.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.229
Why?

52:30.230 --> 52:31.856
Because I know, in
my heart and my gut,

52:31.857 --> 52:33.399
that if I make this
trade with Buffalo,

52:33.400 --> 52:36.903
then I don't get to
make a pick this year.

52:36.904 --> 52:39.572
All I get back are
future draft picks

52:39.573 --> 52:42.997
for the guy that Molina
brings in to replace me.

52:45.829 --> 52:48.002
I've been here two years, Ali.

52:50.668 --> 52:52.590
Two years.

52:53.128 --> 52:55.797
I've never gotten a chance to

52:55.798 --> 52:58.926
see what a team I put
together can do out there.

53:00.678 --> 53:03.146
First year, it's my dad's team.

53:03.514 --> 53:06.766
Last year, Drew goes down
before I can see what we had.

53:06.767 --> 53:09.144
Then I get stuck with Penn,

53:09.937 --> 53:13.441
who I'm still trying to
figure out how to work with.

53:13.649 --> 53:16.948
This is finally supposed
to be my season.

53:18.487 --> 53:22.287
I just want the team
that I want. One time.

53:22.449 --> 53:25.577
So why are you bugging
me if you already know?

53:27.538 --> 53:29.460
I don't know.

53:34.294 --> 53:36.387
I'm makin' mistakes.

53:41.218 --> 53:43.219
Remember the '89 Super Bowl?

53:43.220 --> 53:45.472
49ers-Bengals.

53:46.056 --> 53:49.183
Niners down by three,
3:20 left in the game.

53:49.184 --> 53:53.312
93-yard winning drive, Taylor beats
the weak safety for a 10-yard TD.

53:53.313 --> 53:56.407
Yeah, but before the drive.

53:57.526 --> 54:00.820
Joe Montana's in the huddle. Right?

54:00.821 --> 54:02.780
<i>And unbelievably, somehow spots</i>

54:02.781 --> 54:04.824
<i>the actor John Candy in the stands.</i>

54:04.825 --> 54:07.827
He points at him and asks
the guys in the huddle,

54:07.828 --> 54:11.332
"Hey, isn't that John Candy?"

54:13.208 --> 54:15.668
They couldn't believe
the balls on him.

54:15.669 --> 54:19.093
To be that calm, in that
game, at that moment.

54:19.840 --> 54:24.015
His guys instantly
relax, they march...

54:24.178 --> 54:26.012
93 yards.

54:26.013 --> 54:28.431
93 yards.

54:28.432 --> 54:30.855
<i>Montana throws a little
slant to Taylor.</i>

54:32.102 --> 54:34.445
<i>49ers win the Super Bowl.</i>

54:34.772 --> 54:36.189
Great game.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.408
It was a great game.

54:45.115 --> 54:48.038
No one can stop a ticking clock.

54:48.368 --> 54:50.461
But the great ones,

54:51.038 --> 54:54.212
the great ones always find
a way to slow it down.

54:55.292 --> 54:58.045
So slow it down, Sonny.

55:01.256 --> 55:04.225
Okay. I made a decision.

55:04.551 --> 55:08.471
It's still Callahan. Let's
inform Buffalo that it's a no.

55:08.472 --> 55:10.224
That is beautiful.

55:10.265 --> 55:11.891
Okay, Sonny. We're with you.

55:11.892 --> 55:13.226
Like hell we are.

55:13.227 --> 55:16.062
All due respect, Sonny,
that is a bonehead move.

55:16.063 --> 55:18.564
Maybe so, but we're
back on Callahan.

55:18.565 --> 55:21.567
Do me a favor. Let's put up the
Wisconsin-Ohio State footage.

55:21.568 --> 55:22.735
Yeah, sure thing, Sonny.

55:22.736 --> 55:24.612
We've seen that footage,
like, two million times.

55:24.613 --> 55:27.031
What are you hopin' to find in
it that we haven't seen already?

55:27.032 --> 55:28.366
I'm just double-checking something.

55:28.367 --> 55:29.408
All right. Here we go.

55:29.409 --> 55:32.958
All right, roll it down to the
first time Vontae sacks Bo.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.131
All right. Here we go.

55:37.584 --> 55:40.294
Damn. He shook off two blockers
like they were rag dolls.

55:40.295 --> 55:41.754
And then Bo walks into a bear hug.

55:41.755 --> 55:43.130
Vontae wrapped him up pretty good.

55:43.131 --> 55:44.674
Yeah, Bo's hard to sack.

55:44.675 --> 55:47.473
He was one of the least-sacked
QBs in Division I last year.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.178
Go to the next play.

55:49.179 --> 55:50.596
The next sack?

55:50.597 --> 55:53.350
No. The next play after this one.

55:58.438 --> 55:59.856
What's he doing?

55:59.857 --> 56:03.359
He got flustered. Didn't wait
for the play to develop.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.944
Not Bo's finest moment.

56:04.945 --> 56:07.697
No. Whatever, it's one play.

56:07.698 --> 56:10.200
Take us down to Vontae's next sack.

56:12.911 --> 56:14.663
Ooh!

56:15.122 --> 56:16.372
Oh, man, that is sick!

56:16.373 --> 56:19.792
He absolutely bull-rushed that right
tackle. Bo didn't even have a chance.

56:19.793 --> 56:23.137
Yeah, I gotta give it to the kid.
He's got a wicked first step.

56:23.255 --> 56:25.723
- See what he does on the next play.
- All right.

56:29.928 --> 56:31.846
Speed kills. Look at that.

56:31.847 --> 56:33.639
Yeah, look at that.
He gets frantic.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.349
My favorite thing about rookie QBs.

56:35.350 --> 56:37.894
They get frantic when they
think they're gonna get hit.

56:37.895 --> 56:38.978
Although I gotta give him credit.

56:38.979 --> 56:40.521
Barrio' those two plays,
he was brilliant.

56:40.522 --> 56:43.400
He threw four TDs, including
the last one to win it.

56:45.819 --> 56:46.944
Take us down to that.

56:46.945 --> 56:48.446
Yeah.

56:52.117 --> 56:55.746
Looking downfield, staying calm.

56:56.163 --> 56:58.414
Sonny, this guy's textbook.

56:58.415 --> 57:01.959
Man, this kid is strong.
That's impressive.

57:01.960 --> 57:06.306
That's pure Roethlisberger.
He's pro-ready. End of story.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.174
Take it back.

57:08.634 --> 57:12.138
Rewind that back to the
start of the play.

57:12.471 --> 57:14.348
Just stop right here.

57:14.514 --> 57:15.681
What's missing?

57:15.682 --> 57:16.807
Fullback.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.309
But Wisconsin runs most of their

57:18.310 --> 57:20.019
passing plays out of
an empty backfield.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.363
No, not what I'm
lookin' at. Try again.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.152
Where's Vontae?

57:29.821 --> 57:32.281
You know what, Sonny?
I think he got ejected.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.200
- He got ejected from the game?
- Yeah.

57:34.201 --> 57:35.284
For what?

57:35.285 --> 57:37.119
Yeah, in the third
quarter, after he stripped

57:37.120 --> 57:39.038
the ball from Callahan
and scored that TD.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.539
He gave the ball to a fan.

57:40.540 --> 57:42.375
When he got flagged
for it, he went nuts,

57:42.376 --> 57:44.168
touched the refs. So
they threw him out.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.003
Bonehead move.

57:46.004 --> 57:47.676
Let's see that.

58:11.738 --> 58:14.490
This is college. What's
he thinkin', you know?

58:16.743 --> 58:18.745
See? That's it.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.037
There you go.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.498
He was showing off. You
can't do that in college.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.797
You can't hand the
ball to some girl.

58:26.545 --> 58:28.879
That's not some girl.

58:28.880 --> 58:31.428
That's not some girl, guys.
That's his sister.

58:34.636 --> 58:37.264
She died about six months later.

58:38.265 --> 58:41.268
Boo-friggin'-hoo.

58:41.393 --> 58:43.561
We ain't runnin' an
after-school special here.

58:43.562 --> 58:45.312
We're runnin' a football team,

58:45.313 --> 58:48.733
whose offense was ranked 28th
in the league last year.

58:48.734 --> 58:50.907
And I still need a runnin' back.

59:15.302 --> 59:16.469
What can I say, Rich?

59:16.470 --> 59:19.305
I love being here,
I love feeling the energy,

59:19.306 --> 59:21.807
and I love having the
number one pick.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.392
I hope that you would
love having it,

59:23.393 --> 59:25.478
because you sure gave
up a ton to get it.

59:25.479 --> 59:27.605
For the record,
I didn't do anything.

59:27.606 --> 59:29.482
And "ton" is a relative word.

59:29.483 --> 59:30.566
Playing coy. I like it.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.818
Come on, just between two
guys, forget the cameras,

59:32.819 --> 59:34.612
who're you gonna take,
number one overall?

59:34.613 --> 59:38.616
Well, I think it would be
unsportsmanlike, spoil the surprise.

59:38.617 --> 59:41.961
Anthony Molina. Not
giving me anything.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.249
What?

59:47.250 --> 59:48.334
Just please come with me.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.929
What? Oh, no, not back in there.

01:00:01.598 --> 01:00:03.145
So?

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:06.816
So, what do you want?

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:12.199
Honestly...

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.033
I don't want to be a secret.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.712
Okay.

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.416
Let's not be a secret.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.177
Excuse me.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.467
- Jesus, Rick!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.469
The head of security said he
wanted to talk to Mr. Weaver.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:42.472
He said it was urgent.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.723
- Ralph.
- Sonny.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.183
- Ali.
- Ralph.

01:00:46.184 --> 01:00:47.810
Everybody cozy?

01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.396
Good.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:54.572
Sonny, if you don't mind, I've got
something for you in my office.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:02.408
Got a new Callahan story for you.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.243
Not sure I want to hear it.

01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.912
You know, you hung me out to dry
pretty good with the last one.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:08.831
Just talked to Jack
Tate in Washington.

01:01:08.832 --> 01:01:11.250
He said when they found out
they had the number five pick,

01:01:11.251 --> 01:01:13.169
first thing they did was send
a copy of their playbook

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:15.004
to all the guys they
were interested in.

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:16.589
Right. We do the same thing.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.091
No, no, they put a little
special twist on it.

01:01:19.092 --> 01:01:21.594
They tape a $100 bill
to the last page.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:22.761
Why?

01:01:22.762 --> 01:01:24.430
So when they're
interviewin' the guys

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.557
and they ask 'em if they'd
read the whole playbook,

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.726
of course all of 'em
are gonna say yes.

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:32.271
'Bout half of 'em, they mention the
money. But the other half don't.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.315
So, when they tell 'em
about the $100 bill,

01:01:34.316 --> 01:01:35.608
most of the guys get embarrassed.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.942
They get flustered.
They fess up that

01:01:36.943 --> 01:01:38.903
they didn't read the whole thing.

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.447
But ask me what your
boy Bo Callahan did.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.449
You know, I really hate
playing this game with you.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.117
Ask.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.791
All right. What did Bo Callahan do?

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:50.631
Neither.

01:01:50.874 --> 01:01:53.752
He said that he'd read it, and
then he didn't say anything.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.963
So?

01:01:57.047 --> 01:02:00.299
He didn't know about the
$100 bill, Sonny. He lied.

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:01.842
He never read the whole playbook.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.135
So? A lot of guys don't.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:04.887
Yes. But when they
confront him about it

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.473
and they tell him about
the money, he lied again.

01:02:07.474 --> 01:02:08.599
He said something like,

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.819
"Oh, yeah. Now I remember.
Good one. Good one, guys."

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.647
Jack said he is the only
guy to tell the lie

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:19.153
and then to have the balls to
stand and stick up for the lie.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.696
Said it was the second
strangest response

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:25.120
he had seen to the $100 bill thing.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:29.203
Wanna know what the first was?

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:31.664
God damn it, Ralph. Just tell me.

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.759
A kid mailed the $100
bill back to them.

01:02:35.293 --> 01:02:38.254
That kid put it in a card,
and he wrote on the card,

01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:41.340
"Save this for when I win
you the Super Bowl."

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.967
Nice.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.426
Don't you wanna know
who that kid was?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.304
No!

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.436
It was Brian Drew.

01:02:53.019 --> 01:02:55.192
It was Brian Drew.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:20.504
Hey, Zotti.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.298
Texans thinkin' of makin' a move?

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:24.717
Talk to me about Vontae Mack.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.218
<i>Why? What do you wanna know?</i>

01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:27.720
Who cares why?

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:29.888
But you...

01:03:29.889 --> 01:03:31.890
You're thinkin' of
pickin' him at 15?

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:34.018
He's got potential, no?

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:36.738
Friend-to-friend, what
else do I need to know?

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.232
Well, he's a great kid.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:41.317
Come on!

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:43.068
That's what I know!

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:44.820
Quit playing games.

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:47.740
You didn't think he was gonna fall
in the second round, did you?

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.033
Somebody's gonna pick him, Sonny.

01:03:49.034 --> 01:03:50.911
Tell me why that shouldn't be me.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:53.834
I'd never tell you
how to do your job.

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.873
You find something with him?

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:58.422
I didn't say that.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:01.299
You didn't not say that.

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:04.014
Good luck tonight.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:13.020
Stop runnin'!

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:16.935
Any news?

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:19.897
We just got off the phone
with Houston. They're at 15.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:22.617
With the Cleveland thing,
that might be your best shot.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:24.526
Fifteen?

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:27.446
And I'm not 100% sure about that.

01:04:27.447 --> 01:04:29.365
What does that mean, man?

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.617
It means it could be a long night.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:34.962
But stay positive. You never
know with these things.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.044
What's all this?

01:04:43.129 --> 01:04:45.172
Both of you? Really?

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:48.301
Did you have a fire? Or...

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:52.389
I do not need this today.
I really don't.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.931
You look terrible.

01:04:53.932 --> 01:04:54.973
Thank you.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.475
You really do.

01:04:56.476 --> 01:04:58.319
Thank you, too.

01:04:58.937 --> 01:05:02.281
We had the reading
of your dad's will.

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:07.905
Would you believe, he wants his
ashes scattered on his field.

01:05:07.946 --> 01:05:10.164
The practice field? Here?

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.325
Weaver Field. Yes.

01:05:13.326 --> 01:05:16.286
And I'd like to do it
as soon as possible.

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:18.122
You can't be serious.

01:05:18.123 --> 01:05:19.623
Why? I'm not gonna bother anyone.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:22.501
I just wanna do it exactly
as he asked for it.

01:05:22.502 --> 01:05:27.178
And he wants you to read
this while we're scattering.

01:05:27.507 --> 01:05:29.341
It's a Gaelic blessing.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:31.640
Now? You're saying you
want to do all this now?

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:35.347
All we have to do is walk out
on the 50-yard line with you...

01:05:35.348 --> 01:05:36.765
- You read the...
- With me?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:38.183
It's what he wanted.

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.185
How the hell would you
know what he wanted?

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.353
Please don't shout.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:43.856
Because I was at the will
reading. Unlike you.

01:05:43.857 --> 01:05:45.524
Isn't there an art
exhibition in New York

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.276
that you have to be
at or something?

01:05:47.277 --> 01:05:49.194
This isn't going to
be a long affair.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.613
We just go out there, read the
prayer, dump the ashes, and go home.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.698
No!

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:54.325
Is everything okay?

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:58.212
Everything's fine.

01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.965
Ali, this is my ex-wife, Angie.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.052
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:06.545
Hi, Barb.

01:06:06.546 --> 01:06:08.172
How you doin', Amy?

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:12.556
"Ali." You know it's Ali.

01:06:13.011 --> 01:06:15.058
She's the...

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.389
Oh, her. Oh.

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:18.724
Yeah. That's me.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:20.559
Get us some coffee,
will you, sweetie?

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.227
Mom, that's not her job.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.146
- It's okay. I can get 'em coffee.
- I'll have a green tea.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:25.689
No, stay. Just, please, stay.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:26.899
I'd like to have a coffee, Sonny.

01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.067
No. No. No coffee, Mom.

01:06:29.068 --> 01:06:31.403
You want to spread these goddamn
ashes, you do it tomorrow!

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:32.905
- No.
- I'm serious!

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:34.578
No!

01:06:38.244 --> 01:06:41.580
Now then, are you going to read this
prayer as your father asked you to?

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:43.879
No, I'm not!

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.379
Not today.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:50.931
Fine.

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.760
I will do it myself.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.765
Good luck.

01:07:02.435 --> 01:07:04.562
How about some fresh air?

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:13.445
Whoever thought it meant
that much to him?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:17.701
Naming a simple practice
field in his honor.

01:07:18.409 --> 01:07:22.129
God, he took pride in
the weirdest things.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.962
He was your father, Sonny.

01:07:28.628 --> 01:07:31.972
What was it? Why did
you hate him so much?

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.559
I didn't hate my father.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:41.974
You know what, everyone always gives
me grief for firing my father.

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:45.775
Well, you did. I was here that day.

01:07:47.814 --> 01:07:49.657
It was my mother.

01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:51.650
What?

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.318
It was my mother.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.487
Look, don't get me wrong.
I'm the one who fired him.

01:07:55.488 --> 01:07:59.242
But it was my mother
who asked me to do it.

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:06.290
My dad's doctors told
him that the stress

01:08:06.291 --> 01:08:08.750
of coaching was gonna
kill him, so...

01:08:08.751 --> 01:08:11.169
Of course, he refused to retire.

01:08:11.170 --> 01:08:13.630
So, now I have a choice.

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:16.759
The time he has left at
home with my mother,

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:20.679
or another year on the sidelines,

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:25.777
where maybe he drops dead
on national television.

01:08:28.354 --> 01:08:30.356
So what do you do?

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.529
I gave it to my mom
and I fired him.

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:37.363
How come you never
told me that before?

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:40.032
You know, there's already so
many versions of what happened

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.867
that it's not really somethin'
I love talking about.

01:08:41.868 --> 01:08:43.493
You never told him?

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:46.203
You let him believe that his
only son would just fire him?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:47.538
That's how we do
things in my family.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.212
Sonny.

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:55.219
And all I ever wanted to do
was just get him a ring.

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:03.227
Oh, jeez...

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.140
What is this?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.479
They wanna pay their respects.

01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:27.082
Rick, what are you doing?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:32.923
Someone broke my computer.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.761
Can you believe that? I mean, this
thing had my entire life on it, and...

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.935
I don't know. Who would do that?

01:09:42.886 --> 01:09:44.604
It was me.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.520
I threw it against the wall.

01:09:47.934 --> 01:09:50.435
Yeah. I'm sorry.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:52.938
Why would you do that?

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.942
Look, I lost my head, okay?

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:57.401
I've been steppin'
on my dick all day.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:10:00.951
Look, we'll get you a new one,
all right? We'll get you a better one.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:05.622
One with all the
bells and whistles.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:10.920
Look. You've been a soldier today,
all right? You don't deserve this.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.625
Okay?

01:10:12.875 --> 01:10:14.627
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:10:34.731 --> 01:10:38.150
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome to the red carpet,

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:43.655
from the University of Wisconsin,
2014 Heisman Trophy winner,

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:45.657
quarterback Bo Callahan!

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:52.622
from Florida State University,

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:55.459
running back Ray Jennings.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:58.505
How're you doin'?

01:11:10.516 --> 01:11:13.643
Ray, remind me when they
picked you. Was it first? Second?

01:11:13.644 --> 01:11:14.853
Mmm.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.903
It still hurts. 26th.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.946
Well, that's good, too.

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.528
That's my number one
guy right there.

01:11:23.362 --> 01:11:24.863
Ready?

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:35.457
You got this.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.132
Sonny, my man!

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.428
Oh, I am excited to
hear your voice.

01:11:46.719 --> 01:11:49.137
We were wonderin' when you were
gonna call us with that good news.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.639
<i>Wanna talk to Bo, Chris.</i>

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.733
Here's the man you wanna speak to.

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:55.148
It's the Browns.

01:11:58.898 --> 01:12:00.650
This is Bo.

01:12:01.567 --> 01:12:03.193
Hey, Bo. How you doin'?

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:05.737
<i>Well, I'm good, Mr. Weaver. Excited
to be a part of the NFL, you know.</i>

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.912
Good, that's great, Bo.
Thrilled to hear that.

01:12:09.367 --> 01:12:11.660
Listen, I'm gonna ask you something

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.412
and I want you to be
absolutely honest with me.

01:12:14.413 --> 01:12:15.956
You think you can do that?

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:17.754
Yes, sure. Anything, Mr. Weaver.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:23.048
Bo, did your teammates come
to your birthday party?

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:24.928
What?

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:29.845
For your 21st birthday party,

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:35.773
I'm asking, did your teammates at
Wisconsin come to that party or not?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:39.938
Look, Mr. Weaver,
this isn't somethin'

01:12:39.939 --> 01:12:43.113
I'm really very proud
of, sir, but...

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.697
I don't really remember a single
thing from that night, sir.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.956
You know what?

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.212
I don't remember mine either.

01:13:00.042 --> 01:13:02.465
Thanks, Bo. Talk to you later.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:07.470
What'd he say?

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:11.554
Nothin'.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:47.965
Hey.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.141
You okay?

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.143
Do I take Callahan?

01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:03.318
What do you want me to say?

01:14:04.899 --> 01:14:06.525
He's a winner.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.328
He is.

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:13.281
He is. I mean, that's the word, right?
He's won everywhere he's been.

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:14.908
I get that.

01:14:15.993 --> 01:14:18.828
But they said the same
thing about Ryan Leaf

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:21.206
when he was the number
two pick in '98.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:24.881
No one said that about Tom
Brady when he went 199th.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:29.048
There's no such thing
as a sure thing.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:36.601
At the end of the day, all that
matters is what you think.

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.614
Vontae! Vontae!

01:14:57.368 --> 01:15:00.996
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:04.717
Here we go, Brownies,
here we go! Whoo, whoo!

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:27.105
Oh, dude, that's, like,
your fifth piece of pizza.

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:29.691
I eat when I'm nervous. Don't
make me feel bad about it.

01:15:29.692 --> 01:15:31.609
Yeah, I get like that, too.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.238
Hey, guys. It's gettin' late.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.493
<i>History in the making here
today at the NFL Draft.</i>

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.996
<i>Already fascinating
twists and turns</i>

01:15:42.997 --> 01:15:45.540
<i>as the Seattle Seahawks
and the Cleveland Browns</i>

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:50.763
<i>have engaged in a historic trade
just hours before this moment.</i>

01:16:00.222 --> 01:16:02.474
Here's the Commissioner.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:19.451
Welcome to primetime and
the 2014 NFL Draft.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:23.079
This is an exciting
night for our players,

01:16:23.245 --> 01:16:24.837
our teams,

01:16:24.997 --> 01:16:26.873
and for you, the fans.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:34.674
The season begins tonight,
so let's kick it off.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:39.763
The 2014 NFL Draft
is officially open.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:47.311
After an earlier trade with
the Seattle Seahawks today,

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:50.272
the Cleveland Browns
are now on the clock.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.527
Where the hell is Sonny, guys?
We're on the clock here.

01:16:55.528 --> 01:16:57.862
- I don't know.
- Yeah. Should be here.

01:16:57.863 --> 01:16:59.614
<i>Okay. So the Browns
now have 10 minutes</i>

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:01.407
<i>on the clock to make a choice.</i>

01:17:01.408 --> 01:17:03.576
<i>And if they don't do
that in that time,</i>

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.121
the team picking behind
them can then jump up

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:09.249
and potentially steal away the
player the Browns wanted.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:13.044
It's a situation we saw play out in
2003 with the Minnesota Vikings

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:17.095
<i>and it happened again in 2011
with the Baltimore Ravens.</i>

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.100
Sonny!

01:17:27.101 --> 01:17:30.855
Yeah, thank God! Yeah, I was
wondering what you were doing.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.731
Yeah. It's go time, boss.

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:37.452
Yeah, yeah. What name do you
want the Commissioner to say?

01:17:39.822 --> 01:17:41.323
All right.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.626
Hey, guys, he's here.

01:17:53.627 --> 01:17:55.920
Sonny, thank God. Where you
been? We're on the clock!

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.755
Sonny, when are we
sendin' in the ticket?

01:17:57.756 --> 01:17:59.257
Yeah.

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.301
I already sent the ticket.

01:18:01.302 --> 01:18:02.760
You did what?

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:04.596
You sent the ticket?

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:05.930
It's tradition! We all send it!

01:18:05.931 --> 01:18:07.682
New tradition, guys, all right?

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:11.778
When this team starts winning,
we'll go back to that.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:21.863
And the pick is finally in.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:23.031
It's currently being brandished

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:25.200
by some walkie-talkied individual

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.294
taking it up to the
Commissioner's podium.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:31.336
<i>A big, humongous pick for
the Cleveland Browns.</i>

01:18:32.374 --> 01:18:34.876
<i>Now, to find out whose
name is on that card,</i>

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.796
<i>here's the Commissioner ready
to make history in Cleveland.</i>

01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:51.940
With the first pick of
the 2014 NFL Draft,

01:18:53.812 --> 01:18:56.314
the Cleveland Browns select.

01:18:57.733 --> 01:19:01.945
<i>Vontae Mack, linebacker,
Ohio State.</i>

01:19:12.915 --> 01:19:14.499
Yes! Yes!

01:19:20.256 --> 01:19:21.798
These things happen.

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.513
That's what you decided to do?

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:37.105
An absolute stunner here
at Radio City Music Hall.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:39.315
The Cleveland Browns, with
the number one overall pick,

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.609
take Vontae Mack!

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:43.695
<i>Unbelievable to me
that Sonny Weaver Jr.</i>

01:19:43.696 --> 01:19:45.822
<i>would make a deal of this magnitude</i>

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:47.365
<i>and come away with this.</i>

01:19:47.366 --> 01:19:49.033
Forget about Vontae
Mack for a second.

01:19:49.034 --> 01:19:50.702
They could have had Bo Callahan.

01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:53.204
He's the surefire slam-dunk
number one pick.

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.789
We all knew it comin' in here.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:57.709
If I'm Brian Drew, current
quarterback of the Cleveland Browns,

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.085
I better play good.

01:20:30.534 --> 01:20:32.452
Yeah. No, no. I realize that.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:34.329
He wants to talk to him right now.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.580
Then call me back.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:36.622
I'm sorry, sir...

01:20:36.623 --> 01:20:38.041
Just get in the damn car.

01:20:38.042 --> 01:20:39.542
This is Anthony.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.377
Tell Sonny I'm on
my way to Teterboro

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:45.974
and I will literally be in his face in
an hour and he will talk to me then.

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:47.968
I will, sir.

01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:50.762
- Safe trip, sir.
- Thank you, Marvin.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.823
It's Sonny.

01:21:10.699 --> 01:21:12.784
Sonny Weaver Jr.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:16.164
Congratulations, Vontae.
You're a Cleveland Brown.

01:21:16.663 --> 01:21:19.541
I'm a Cleveland Brown!

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.626
Car's gonna be picking
you up in 10 minutes,

01:21:21.627 --> 01:21:23.294
and we're flying you to Cleveland.

01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.012
You think you can manage that?

01:21:25.130 --> 01:21:28.474
Oh...

01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:36.103
You need to get back inside.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.267
What just happened?

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:40.736
This is the NFL Draft.

01:21:40.771 --> 01:21:43.990
These things happen all the time.

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:46.109
Now trust me.

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:49.153
These teams, they don't want
a quarterback that panics.

01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:52.032
I need you to come inside, now.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.293
Come on.

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:12.685
You picked Vontae. Wow.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:17.975
Three first-round picks to get the
guy I could have gotten all along.

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:21.978
Jesus, I used to think
I was good at this.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:23.729
Well, that remains to be seen.

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:28.611
Sometimes, the correct
path is the tortured one.

01:22:29.862 --> 01:22:31.946
It's a gift, Sonny.

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.576
You see things other people
don't see. It's one of the things...

01:22:38.412 --> 01:22:41.415
It's one of the things
I love about you.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:48.463
Excuse me.

01:22:49.256 --> 01:22:50.923
You're not gonna believe
what's happening.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.425
<i>You know, I think back, Deion,</i>

01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:56.554
<i>and I go back to 1983 and I start
thinkin' about Dan Marino.</i>

01:22:56.555 --> 01:22:58.222
<i>He was the sixth
quarterback taken...</i>

01:22:58.223 --> 01:22:59.765
Holy shit!

01:22:59.766 --> 01:23:00.850
What's goin' on?

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.773
He's dropping.

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:03.978
What?

01:23:03.979 --> 01:23:06.189
Picks number two and three
are not Bo Callahan.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:07.987
Nobody's pickin' him.

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:11.861
<i>Just last year.</i>

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:13.404
<i>Geno Smith drops out
of the first round,</i>

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:16.491
<i>and there are all kinds of
rumors goin' on right now,</i>

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:19.165
<i>"Why is this kid dropping and..."</i>

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:21.746
Everybody's freaking out, Sonny.

01:23:21.747 --> 01:23:24.841
St. Louis went with Anderson.
Miami took Palmer.

01:23:26.710 --> 01:23:27.877
Who's picking fourth?

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.425
Arizona.

01:23:29.922 --> 01:23:31.464
Are they gonna take Callahan?

01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:33.841
They should, but everybody's
off their game.

01:23:33.842 --> 01:23:36.427
Rams and the Dolphins, both
went with their expected picks,

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.179
even though Bo was still available.

01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.723
Everybody's panickin' 'cause
Callahan's still there.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:44.524
Jesus, what if he drops to seventh?
Seahawks have seventh.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.562
What if they ended
up with Callahan?

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:49.232
Well, then Tom Michaels
is the GM of the decade.

01:23:49.233 --> 01:23:52.443
I'm goin' to the can, to throw up.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:56.197
Okay. Denver has five.
Jacksonville has six.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:57.782
Yeah, but Denver's not
gonna take Callahan.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.283
They got Herrod, he's an All-Pro.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:02.458
So if Arizona balks, then
Jacksonville's all over him.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.789
Unless they balk, too.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.251
And our friend Tom Michaels
grabs him at seven. Shit!

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:11.221
They have that kid GM down in
Jacksonville. What is his name?

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.297
Jeff Carson.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:14.465
Rookie.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.764
Right, Jeff Carson.

01:24:41.368 --> 01:24:42.535
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:44.954
Holy shit, man. What do you
know? What do you know?

01:24:44.955 --> 01:24:46.547
<i>About what?</i>

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:49.500
About this! About this thing!
What's wrong with Callahan?

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.669
Nothing. We like Vontae better.

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.171
The Rams took my pick.
Everything's out of whack.

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:56.720
<i>Well, you still have time.</i>

01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.969
Arizona is picking right now.

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:01.847
You're right. Hold on.

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:06.976
<i>With the fourth pick
of the 2014 NFL Draft,</i>

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:09.395
<i>the Arizona Cardinals select</i>

01:25:09.396 --> 01:25:13.357
<i>Robert Starks, cornerback,
Georgia Tech.</i>

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:19.497
Wow. Arizona went corner.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.699
Shit. Starks was my backup.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.577
That's a tough break, but,
hey, Callahan's still in play.

01:25:24.578 --> 01:25:26.245
Who's pickin' fifth?

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:28.956
The Broncos, and they're
not taking Callahan.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.250
They got Matt Herrod.
They don't need Callahan.

01:25:31.251 --> 01:25:32.376
Yeah, I think you're right.

01:25:32.377 --> 01:25:34.378
I think they're gonna go with
that big kid outta Oregon.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:36.802
Dearborne. Left tackle.

01:25:37.424 --> 01:25:40.343
Well, congratulations, Jeff.

01:25:40.344 --> 01:25:42.386
Looks like you got
yourself Bo Callahan

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:44.555
to quarterback the
Jacksonville Jaguars.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.729
You gotta be straight with me.

01:25:47.184 --> 01:25:48.643
About what?

01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:51.479
What's wrong with Callahan?
Why is everyone passin' on him?

01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.772
Why did you pass on him?

01:25:52.773 --> 01:25:54.523
I told you. We like Vontae better.

01:25:54.524 --> 01:25:58.778
Damn it, Sonny, I'm about to
be on the clock here. Please.

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:00.321
What's wrong with Callahan?

01:26:00.322 --> 01:26:01.739
Can I be frank with you?

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.241
Yes.

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:05.868
I think he's a bust.

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:08.412
What?

01:26:08.413 --> 01:26:09.705
How? Why?

01:26:09.706 --> 01:26:12.425
I don't know. Gut feeling.

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:16.045
To be honest, Jeff, it's a
character thing for me.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.380
But, look, I have other needs.

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.757
So, if you wanna make
a trade for six,

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.926
I can make that happen right now.

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:24.220
You want six? Who are you takin'?

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:27.848
<i>I can't tell you that, Jeff.</i>

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:29.934
The question is, do you
want to make a trade?

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:32.770
Because if you're not
sold on Callahan,

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:35.064
you can still come out of here
with a handful of draft picks,

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:37.108
you look like a seasoned pro,

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:40.027
<i>and everybody wonders what
you're up to next year.</i>

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.029
I don't know. I don't know, Sonny.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:47.081
Look, Jeff, every year someone comes
out of this looking like a donkey.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:49.537
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:51.122
Good. Because tomorrow
I got a feeling

01:26:51.123 --> 01:26:53.625
it could be you if you
don't make this deal.

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:59.505
Look, everyone else has a reason

01:26:59.506 --> 01:27:02.350
to pass on Bo Callahan. You don't.

01:27:03.427 --> 01:27:05.144
Give me six.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:09.181
Give me six and I'll give you
our second-round pick this year

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:11.267
and our second-rounder next year.

01:27:11.268 --> 01:27:12.940
Do what?

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.022
Oh! That sounds awesome,
Sonny. What am I, a jerk?

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.400
I'm just spit-balling here, Jeff.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:22.987
<i>Two number twos for the
sixth overall? I'm not an idiot.</i>

01:27:22.988 --> 01:27:25.239
I'd give you ones, but
I already dealt 'em.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.700
Well, you're gonna have
to do better than that.

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:29.243
Jesus, the clock.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.745
I know. Denver hasn't picked yet,

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:33.123
but they will any
second, all right?

01:27:33.165 --> 01:27:36.589
Shit, Sonny, I need more. Tell me.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:40.179
What is the very best
that you can do?

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:53.063
Final offer.

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:55.936
Take our number two pick this year,

01:27:55.937 --> 01:27:58.731
next year, and the
next year after that.

01:27:58.732 --> 01:28:01.326
That's three years
of number two picks.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:12.667
Four. I want your next
four number twos.

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:16.707
Nah, Jeff, I'm not gonna do that.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:19.293
Stay with me on planet
Earth here, all right?

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:22.013
You know what I just
offered you is fair.

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:27.269
So, three years of second-rounders?

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:30.179
That's right. For
your pick right now.

01:28:30.180 --> 01:28:31.847
And you and your guys can regroup,

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:35.397
figure yourselves out and relax.

01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:42.033
This is a good deal, Jeff.

01:28:44.194 --> 01:28:47.243
This is a good deal for both of us.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.204
Deal.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:01.919
Good, Jeff. You did good.

01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:04.764
Call it in. Call it in.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:08.100
Hey, this is Marx.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.806
We got something, Ken.

01:29:13.723 --> 01:29:15.975
- Cleveland's in this.
- And Jacksonville.

01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:17.477
Okay, give it to me.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:20.938
Okay, somebody get me Tom
Michaels on the phone.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:22.986
Tell me you didn't
just do that, Sonny.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:26.443
Michaels. Tom Michaels.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:27.528
Are we on the clock?

01:29:27.529 --> 01:29:29.446
Tell me you didn't just do that.

01:29:29.447 --> 01:29:30.531
We just got the number six pick.

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:33.158
And, no, we are not on the clock.
Denver's on the clock.

01:29:33.159 --> 01:29:35.452
Okay, so we got six!
Who are we picking at six?

01:29:35.453 --> 01:29:37.121
Rick, can you get Marvin
on the phone now?

01:29:37.122 --> 01:29:38.289
Let me get this straight.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.292
In the span of one day, you
have managed to burn through

01:29:41.293 --> 01:29:44.503
three years' worth of number one and
number two picks, is that correct?

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:45.588
Yeah.

01:29:45.589 --> 01:29:47.506
- I quit, Sonny.
- Don't quit.

01:29:47.507 --> 01:29:49.258
I can't coach a team that
doesn't have a future, Sonny.

01:29:49.259 --> 01:29:50.384
That's the way it works.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.677
I got Tom Michaels on the line!

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:53.178
Sonny, are we trading six?

01:29:53.179 --> 01:29:55.602
Will everyone please just shut up?

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:57.641
People, please,

01:29:57.642 --> 01:30:01.897
can I have a moment of goddamn silence
while I do my job here, okay?

01:30:03.648 --> 01:30:05.858
Look. Don't quit, all right?

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:09.236
Just let me do my job here.
Just let me do this. Don't quit now.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:12.741
If, by the end of the night, you
still wanna quit, then quit.

01:30:12.824 --> 01:30:15.034
Just see what I do from here.

01:30:15.035 --> 01:30:16.785
Your show, Sonny.

01:30:16.786 --> 01:30:18.378
Tom Michaels is holding.

01:30:20.081 --> 01:30:21.790
You son of a bitch!

01:30:21.791 --> 01:30:23.542
Anthony, I need five
minutes, all right?

01:30:23.543 --> 01:30:25.461
Five minutes, and
then you can fire me.

01:30:25.462 --> 01:30:26.962
Sonny, you are a dead man.

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:29.465
Mr. Molina. Mr. Molina.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:30:29.466 --> 01:30:31.926
Just give him a minute.
He knows what he's doing.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:33.260
Tom, it's Sonny.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.347
Jesus, Mary and Whatnot. Do I
owe you a thank you, Weaver?

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:38.265
Jacksonville's on the clock

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:41.352
and I'm one more crazy
shit-show from insanity.

01:30:41.353 --> 01:30:45.147
Can you imagine, scoring three
first-round picks and Bo Callahan?

01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:48.817
Lord God, let that infant
John Carson screw this up.

01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:51.111
It's Jeff Carson, Tom, and
he doesn't have the pick.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:52.704
I do.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.407
What?

01:30:55.408 --> 01:30:59.703
I just made a trade with Jacksonville.
I'm on the clock. It's me.

01:30:59.704 --> 01:31:00.788
Bullshit!

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:01.997
<i>The Jacksonville Jaguars</i>

01:31:01.998 --> 01:31:03.248
<i>have made a trade.</i>

01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:07.674
<i>The Cleveland Browns now have the
sixth pick and are on the clock.</i>

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:12.758
Sonny, what'd you give 'em?

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:14.343
No time for that. I'm on the clock.

01:31:14.344 --> 01:31:16.470
I'm gonna pick Bo, Tom.
Unless you want him more.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.430
And if so, let's make a deal.

01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.308
We still have Bo Callahan?

01:31:20.684 --> 01:31:22.777
What the hell's goin' on, Sonny?

01:31:23.269 --> 01:31:24.853
Everyone thinks there's
something wrong

01:31:24.854 --> 01:31:26.355
with the kid, but you
don't, all right?

01:31:26.356 --> 01:31:27.481
You've done your due diligence.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.483
You're about to pull off
the move of the century.

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:32.453
But you need my pick to do it.
So make me an offer.

01:31:33.863 --> 01:31:36.740
You've gone rogue.
You've gone renegade.

01:31:36.741 --> 01:31:39.539
Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly right.

01:31:39.869 --> 01:31:41.829
I could have gotten
Vontae at seven,

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.288
but instead I trade up with you

01:31:43.289 --> 01:31:44.707
just so I could get him at one.

01:31:44.708 --> 01:31:46.959
Jesus Christ. You were
right about me, Tom.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.878
I am a crazy man. So, come
on, take advantage of it.

01:31:49.879 --> 01:31:51.596
What are you waitin' for?

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:59.018
Make me a deal, Tom, at six,
and you get your boy wonder.

01:32:01.016 --> 01:32:02.563
What do you want?

01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.771
I want my number ones
back. All of 'em.

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.900
That's crazy. Why would
I give them back?

01:32:11.901 --> 01:32:14.778
Because, at the end of the
day, no one's the wiser, Tom.

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:16.030
You haven't lost anything

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:17.156
and you get the quarterback messiah

01:32:17.157 --> 01:32:20.706
you've always wanted
for $7 million less.

01:32:25.498 --> 01:32:29.251
Nah. No, I can't do it. I'd look
like an idiot, like I panicked.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:30.878
<i>You take him. You
obviously don't want to.</i>

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:32.546
<i>I'll stick with my draft picks.</i>

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.965
Yeah, but you want
him, Tom, don't you?

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:37.426
Seahawks fans want a
hero and you denied 'em.

01:32:37.427 --> 01:32:39.178
- Not that bad.
<i>- Don't lie to me.</i>

01:32:39.179 --> 01:32:41.388
I checked all the Seahawk
fan blogs and chat rooms.

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:43.599
They're all calling for your head.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.142
Ever since you traded
away Callahan,

01:32:45.143 --> 01:32:46.852
the barbarians are at the gate.

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:48.562
I don't care about that.

01:32:48.563 --> 01:32:51.942
Yeah, you do. You
and I both know it.

01:32:52.692 --> 01:32:54.693
I have the golden ticket now, Tom,

01:32:54.694 --> 01:32:59.290
and if I give it to you, you get to
save Seahawk football in Seattle.

01:33:01.618 --> 01:33:02.785
Um...

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:06.163
How 'bout I give you
number two picks?

01:33:06.164 --> 01:33:07.748
No. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:10.334
No, I want my picks
back. All of them.

01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:13.295
I want all three years of
this team's future back.

01:33:13.296 --> 01:33:14.338
That's not fair!

01:33:14.339 --> 01:33:15.798
Well, you wanna cry about it, Tom,

01:33:15.799 --> 01:33:17.007
or you wanna make a little magic

01:33:17.008 --> 01:33:19.351
before the clock runs
out on both of us?

01:33:20.178 --> 01:33:23.263
$7 million cheaper solves
our salary cap problem.

01:33:23.264 --> 01:33:25.099
We're still gonna give
the fans what they want.

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:26.350
Okay. Screw it!

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.227
No more offer. It's
off the table, Tom.

01:33:28.228 --> 01:33:30.187
- I'm takin' Callahan.
- Whoa, whoa. No, no.

01:33:30.188 --> 01:33:31.563
Wait, wait!

01:33:34.734 --> 01:33:36.401
All right. You have a deal.

01:33:36.402 --> 01:33:39.200
<i>I'll give you your picks!
We have a deal!</i>

01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:41.991
What else do we need?

01:33:43.535 --> 01:33:44.993
Offense?

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:46.370
Special teams. Putney! Get Putney!

01:33:46.371 --> 01:33:47.955
Yes! David Putney! Putney!

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:49.833
Yeah. Putney.

01:33:51.292 --> 01:33:54.011
Hello? Sonny?

01:33:56.589 --> 01:33:58.340
I'm sorry, that deal's
now off the table.

01:33:58.341 --> 01:33:59.633
What?

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:03.434
We live in a different world than
we did just 30 seconds ago.

01:34:04.097 --> 01:34:05.389
Come on.

01:34:05.390 --> 01:34:06.891
What?

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:09.189
What do you want now?

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:13.814
I want my picks back

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:16.400
and I want David Putney.

01:34:16.401 --> 01:34:17.985
<i>I need a punt returner.</i>

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.156
<i>Where the hell did that come from?</i>

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:24.158
It doesn't matter.
I want all my picks back.

01:34:24.159 --> 01:34:26.660
And I want David goddamn Putney
just because I feel like it.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.120
- You're outta your mind.
- Yeah, I am.

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:30.498
Haven't I proved that already?

01:34:30.748 --> 01:34:34.001
You make this deal right now,
Tom, and you get Bo Callahan.

01:34:34.002 --> 01:34:35.503
Say it with me.

01:34:36.754 --> 01:34:39.382
"You get Bo."

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:44.783
Come on, Tom, say it with me,
you pancake-eating motherfucker.

01:34:54.439 --> 01:34:57.774
All right. Shit. Deal.

01:34:57.775 --> 01:34:59.484
Great! You're welcome.

01:34:59.485 --> 01:35:01.487
Confirm the trade.

01:35:02.614 --> 01:35:06.038
God damn it, I love this job!

01:35:10.079 --> 01:35:12.832
Hold on. Looks like Cleveland's
making another trade.

01:35:12.916 --> 01:35:14.291
We got a trade.

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:15.959
Okay, this means we're
picking next, all right?

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.087
Back at seven, where we started.

01:35:18.463 --> 01:35:20.881
Tom's gonna take Bo.
So who do we got?

01:35:20.882 --> 01:35:22.474
Ray Jennings.

01:35:25.970 --> 01:35:27.888
We take Ray Jennings.

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:30.182
That's right. Cleveland royalty.

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:31.934
Haven't I been telling
everybody that

01:35:31.935 --> 01:35:34.153
that's what we need,
a running back?

01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.355
Still wanna quit, Coach?

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:37.857
What?

01:35:38.233 --> 01:35:40.442
Does this sound like a
team that you wanna coach?

01:35:40.443 --> 01:35:42.236
Because the Browns
are ready to roll.

01:35:42.237 --> 01:35:44.489
We just need the right
man at the wheel.

01:35:45.782 --> 01:35:47.658
I can coach this team.

01:35:47.659 --> 01:35:49.451
I know you can.

01:35:49.452 --> 01:35:51.828
Why don't you give
Ray Jennings a call?

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:53.914
Ask him if he wants to be a Brown.

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:56.964
Then tell him to pack his bags
so he can join us at our party.

01:35:57.293 --> 01:35:59.761
My pleasure, boss.

01:36:05.260 --> 01:36:09.230
You got some set of balls,
Sonny. Congratulations.

01:36:12.225 --> 01:36:13.726
Thank you.

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:27.030
<i>After a trade with the
Cleveland Browns,</i>

01:36:27.031 --> 01:36:32.037
<i>with the sixth pick of
the 2014 NFL Draft,</i>

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:36.250
<i>the Seattle Seahawks
select Bo Callahan.</i>

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:39.886
<i>Quarterback, University
of Wisconsin.</i>

01:37:10.783 --> 01:37:12.284
Hello?

01:37:16.748 --> 01:37:18.340
Hold on.

01:37:21.127 --> 01:37:22.544
Hello?

01:37:22.545 --> 01:37:25.172
Ray? Coach Penn of the
Cleveland Browns.

01:37:25.173 --> 01:37:26.590
Hi, Coach.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:30.766
<i>How would you like to play
for your Pop's old team?</i>

01:37:43.358 --> 01:37:44.775
I'm gonna be a Brown.

01:37:48.529 --> 01:37:49.905
You're gonna be a Brown!

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.865
General Manager Sonny Weaver Jr.

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:53.742
took one pick in the first round,

01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:55.285
the number seven pick.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:58.789
He sprinkled it with fairy
dust, wished upon a star,

01:37:58.790 --> 01:38:01.541
and somehow, he turned it
into not one, not two,

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:04.461
but three potentially
impactful players

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:06.630
for his team next year. One pick!

01:38:06.631 --> 01:38:10.476
He took a chance and went with
his gut and took his guys.

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:12.260
<i>Make no mistake about it.</i>

01:38:12.261 --> 01:38:14.805
<i>The Cleveland Browns are
his team now for sure.</i>

01:38:14.806 --> 01:38:17.724
<i>This is the Draft Day Browns
fans were waiting for.</i>

01:38:17.725 --> 01:38:19.935
<i>Sonny Weaver Jr. pulled it off.</i>

01:38:19.936 --> 01:38:21.853
When you were like,
"I want all my picks back,

01:38:21.854 --> 01:38:24.606
"and I want David goddamn
Putney because I feel like it!"

01:38:24.607 --> 01:38:27.442
Like, how did you
come up with that?

01:38:27.443 --> 01:38:28.568
I was pissed.

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.986
<i>Here, look at who
we have right now.</i>

01:38:29.987 --> 01:38:31.279
<i>Let me break it down.</i>

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:36.660
<i>Vontae Mack, the guy who plays
with more passion and inspiration</i>

01:38:36.661 --> 01:38:40.165
<i>than anyone in college
football, he's a Brown.</i>

01:38:40.289 --> 01:38:44.376
<i>Ray Jennings, the running back the
Browns have needed for years.</i>

01:38:44.377 --> 01:38:46.711
<i>A return man to help
out on special teams,</i>

01:38:46.712 --> 01:38:49.381
<i>and, Rich, just like we wanted,</i>

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:53.802
<i>Brian Drew, back at
quarterback, where he belongs.</i>

01:38:53.803 --> 01:38:55.595
<i>I don't even wanna hear
about Bo Callahan.</i>

01:38:55.596 --> 01:38:59.015
<i>If he thinks Callahan's a bust,
who am I to argue with that?</i>

01:38:59.016 --> 01:39:02.352
<i>He turned nothin' into
a big-time somethin'.</i>

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:03.854
Smile for the cameras, Coach.

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:06.606
<i>This is a day for
Cleveland to celebrate.</i>

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:08.733
We had a great day!

01:39:08.734 --> 01:39:13.697
Super Bowl! Super Bowl! Super Bowl!

01:39:21.581 --> 01:39:24.708
That was gonna go
down a different way.

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:26.210
Mom?

01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:29.172
There you are.

01:39:30.339 --> 01:39:31.673
You okay?

01:39:31.674 --> 01:39:33.884
Yeah. It was just so
noisy downstairs,

01:39:33.885 --> 01:39:36.433
I had to get a few
minutes of quiet.

01:39:36.804 --> 01:39:38.977
We're taking off.

01:39:39.140 --> 01:39:41.517
You sure you're gonna be okay?

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:47.063
I think your dad would have been

01:39:47.064 --> 01:39:49.783
very happy to coach
a team like this.

01:39:57.158 --> 01:39:59.331
I think so, too.

01:39:59.452 --> 01:40:01.078
Thank you.

01:40:05.041 --> 01:40:08.168
Look, we gotta go.

01:40:08.169 --> 01:40:11.548
Of course. It was a long day.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:15.726
Bye, Ali.

01:40:17.261 --> 01:40:19.513
Good night, Barb.

01:40:22.934 --> 01:40:24.435
Hey, Mom.

01:40:29.690 --> 01:40:31.988
We're gonna have a baby.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:41.752
You're gonna be a grandma.

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:47.378
Thank you.

01:40:56.676 --> 01:40:58.428
Wow!

01:40:58.511 --> 01:41:00.308
That was big.

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.725
I'll get my stuff.

01:41:45.016 --> 01:41:46.099
Joe.

01:41:46.100 --> 01:41:48.602
Hey, Anthony, you did a hell
of a job with the Draft.

01:41:48.603 --> 01:41:50.186
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Jim.

01:41:50.187 --> 01:41:51.354
Very impressive, Anthony.

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:52.897
Thanks, Bernie.

01:41:52.898 --> 01:41:55.241
I can't take all the credit.

01:41:55.443 --> 01:41:56.818
But I will.
