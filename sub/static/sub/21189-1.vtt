to see foreigners

15:06.404 --> 15:09.141
taking a more traditional
approach to hijab.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.376
Unusual. But beware...

19:37.375 --> 19:38.643
your reading,

Don't be embarrassed.

19:53.558 --> 19:55.694
And I think
they get carried away

one place in Iran

Persians settled Shiraz

their Zoroastrian civilization.

22:35.853 --> 22:38.056
In 559 B.C.,

fifth largest city.

of Persia,

<i> Hafiz keeps a 40-day vigil</i>

26:52.209 --> 26:54.946
<i> at the tomb
of the Sufi poet Baba Kuhi.</i>

26:57.381 --> 26:58.816
<i> On his deathbed,</i>

26:58.849 --> 26:59.984
<i> Baba Kuhi promised</i>

27:00.017 --> 27:04.689
<i>that anyone who could stay awake
for 40 days at his tomb</i>

27:04.722 --> 27:06.958
<i> would be granted
the gift of poetry,</i>

27:06.991 --> 27:08.760
<i> of immortality,</i>

27:08.793 --> 27:11.229
<i> and of his heart's desire.</i>

27:23.074 --> 27:26.911
<i> Hafiz meets the poet Attar
and becomes his disciple.</i>

27:30.014 --> 27:35.153
<i> He becomes a poet
of the court of Abu Ishaque,</i>

27:35.186 --> 27:39.224
<i> and becomes very famous
as a Spiritual Romantic.</i>

27:48.332 --> 27:53.071
<i> Hafiz marries another woman
and has a son,</i>

27:53.104 --> 27:56.141
<i> but keeps Shakh-e Nabat
as his poetic muse.</i>

28:04.281 --> 28:06.217
Hmm.

28:14.291 --> 28:18.029
[footsteps crunch in snow]

28:18.062 --> 28:21.032
You are not interested
in the life of Hafiz?

28:23.834 --> 28:25.937
I'm just feeling
a bit jet-lagged,

28:25.970 --> 28:28.840
and there
is so much information.

28:28.873 --> 28:30.775
What a crazy story.

28:30.808 --> 28:32.777
His life
was so complicated.

28:32.810 --> 28:35.413
Yes, life is
complicated in Iran.

28:35.446 --> 28:37.181
Always complicated.

28:37.214 --> 28:39.083
And he didn't get
his heart's desire.

28:39.116 --> 28:42.186
He didn't get
Shakh-e Nabat.

28:42.219 --> 28:44.122
But he did get
his heart's desire.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.224
He got to be
an important poet.

28:46.257 --> 28:49.861
His love for Shakh-e Nabat
fuelled his muse.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.130
But it kind of
sucks for his wife.

28:52.163 --> 28:55.500
True. But it is his poetry
which is important,

28:55.533 --> 28:58.036
not the details
of his life.

28:59.970 --> 29:02.340
You carry around
sugar cubes?

29:02.373 --> 29:03.541
Well, you never know

29:03.574 --> 29:05.009
when you're going
to meet a horse.

29:05.042 --> 29:07.845
They're so beautiful.

29:07.878 --> 29:10.515
Horses are a very
important symbol in Iran,

29:10.548 --> 29:12.550
especially for women.

29:12.583 --> 29:14.452
They endure.

29:14.485 --> 29:15.520
Have you ever read

29:15.553 --> 29:18.022
Alice Walker's
collection of poems,

29:18.055 --> 29:21.025
<i> "Horses Make a Landscape
More Beautiful"?</i>

29:21.058 --> 29:23.194
I don't think I've read
much of anything.

29:23.227 --> 29:24.395
But you write.

29:24.428 --> 29:26.964
Yeah. I don't know
why I write.

29:26.997 --> 29:29.333
Things just bubble up
inside me and I feel...

29:29.366 --> 29:32.136
[Mehrnaz]:
Compelled to write.

29:32.169 --> 29:33.571
Yes. I understand that.

29:33.604 --> 29:36.140
But the more
you learn about others,

29:36.173 --> 29:40.378
the more you deepen
your understanding of yourself.

29:40.411 --> 29:42.280
You don't think I should
be here either, do you?

29:42.313 --> 29:43.881
What?
Who thinks

29:43.914 --> 29:45.016
you shouldn't
be here?

29:45.049 --> 29:47.351
Oh, me. Dietmar.

29:47.384 --> 29:48.452
Rosie...

29:48.485 --> 29:50.288
Don't doubt yourself.

29:50.321 --> 29:52.423
I think
you have a voice.

29:52.456 --> 29:55.459
You just have to find out
how to express it fully.

29:55.492 --> 29:58.329
This is the journey
we are all on.

29:58.362 --> 30:00.164
It takes a lifetime,

30:00.197 --> 30:03.802
sometimes many lifetimes
to learn our own story.

30:05.369 --> 30:07.205
I like to sing.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.508
Ah. That is
complicated too.

30:10.541 --> 30:13.211
But that makes you
a kindred spirit of Hafiz

30:13.244 --> 30:16.013
and all
the Ecstatic poets.

30:16.046 --> 30:19.150
Can anybody go
to the tomb of Baba Kuhi?

30:19.183 --> 30:20.418
[Mehrnaz]: Oh, yes.

30:20.451 --> 30:23.154
It's on a hillside,
and, at the tomb,

30:23.187 --> 30:26.524
there is a dervish
who keeps guard there.

30:26.557 --> 30:29.427
[Rosie]:
Do people go there for 40 days?

30:29.460 --> 30:33.197
[Mehrnaz]:
I don't think it's advisable.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.333
Which is it you want to attain?

30:35.366 --> 30:38.636
Poetry, immortality,
your heart's desire?

30:38.669 --> 30:40.438
[Rosie]:
I thought you get all three.

30:40.471 --> 30:42.073
[Mehrnaz chuckles]: I see.

30:42.106 --> 30:46.911
Maybe you would like to
consult the book of Hafiz.

30:46.944 --> 30:49.480
Oh...Hafiz is also
a fortune-teller?

30:49.513 --> 30:50.915
[Mehrnaz]: Of course.

30:50.948 --> 30:53.985
He writes about
the state of humankind.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.353
I think you'll like it.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.521
I'll show you
the book at dinner.

30:57.554 --> 30:59.323
How is it
everybody here

30:59.356 --> 31:02.026
knows everything
about everything?

31:02.059 --> 31:06.097
Rosie...
we are Persian.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.331
[guide over loudspeaker]:
<i> This is the tomb</i>

31:07.364 --> 31:08.666
<i> of Syed Amir Ahmad,</i>

31:08.699 --> 31:12.536
<i> the brother of Imam Reza,
the 8th Imam.</i>

31:12.569 --> 31:15.573
<i> This is a very holy place...</i>

31:17.074 --> 31:19.210
[♪♪♪]

31:24.214 --> 31:25.349
Something to drink?

31:25.382 --> 31:27.151
Yeah, a beer?

31:27.184 --> 31:28.252
No beer!

31:28.285 --> 31:29.253
<i> Scheisse.</i>

31:29.286 --> 31:32.523
Try a <i> doogh.</i> It's
our yogurt drink.

31:32.556 --> 31:34.191
What?

31:34.224 --> 31:35.293
Nothing.

31:35.326 --> 31:36.928
I guess you don't
know everything

31:36.961 --> 31:38.562
about Iranian culture.

31:38.595 --> 31:40.498
Yeah, I know enough.

31:43.334 --> 31:45.603
[♪♪♪]

31:55.713 --> 31:57.649
[coughing]

32:02.052 --> 32:04.622
[coughing]

32:04.655 --> 32:06.123
Is this smoke
bothering you?

32:06.156 --> 32:08.092
Not at all.

32:10.661 --> 32:11.963
<i> Ni hao.</i>

32:11.996 --> 32:13.164
<i> Ni hao.</i>

32:13.197 --> 32:14.632
You speak Chinese?

32:14.665 --> 32:16.634
Only a couple of words.

32:16.667 --> 32:17.668
[coughing]

32:17.701 --> 32:19.370
I'm half Chinese.

32:19.403 --> 32:22.239
Oh? I thought
you were Iranian.

32:22.272 --> 32:23.741
Why do you say that?

32:23.774 --> 32:25.009
Oh...

32:25.042 --> 32:27.078
I'm just trying to fit in.

32:28.245 --> 32:29.613
Why did
you leave China?

32:29.646 --> 32:31.549
1989.

32:31.582 --> 32:34.218
No, why, not when.

32:34.251 --> 32:40.057
1989 is a "why"
and a "when."

32:40.090 --> 32:41.425
I don't understand.

32:41.458 --> 32:45.163
You're half Chinese.
Don't you have any idea?

32:46.363 --> 32:48.165
I'm going
to tell you,

32:48.198 --> 32:52.103
because I think you should know
about your own history,

32:52.136 --> 32:54.205
and that will make you
a better poet.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.206
I'm Canadian.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.440
It doesn't matter.

32:56.473 --> 32:58.209
You are also Chinese,

32:58.242 --> 33:00.211
and you are part of the world.

33:00.244 --> 33:04.615
I learned this the hard way.

33:04.648 --> 33:07.485
[music turns ominous]
June 4th, 1989.

33:07.518 --> 33:13.457
<i> I get on a plane to England
to promote my book of poems.</i>

33:13.490 --> 33:17.628
<i> It is my first time
out of China.</i>

33:17.661 --> 33:19.296
<i> When I arrive,</i>

33:19.329 --> 33:22.199
<i> there are many reporters
at the airport</i>

33:22.232 --> 33:24.468
<i> asking me</i>

33:24.501 --> 33:28.206
<i> what my opinion
of the events in China are.</i>

33:29.640 --> 33:32.243
<i> "What events in China?"
I ask.</i>

33:32.276 --> 33:37.448
<i> They tell me about a massacre
in Tiananmen Square.</i>

33:37.481 --> 33:39.683
<i> I had seen the protest before.</i>

33:39.716 --> 33:44.622
<i> Some of my friends
were taking part.</i>

33:44.655 --> 33:48.125
<i> I am not a political man.
I am a poet.</i>

33:48.158 --> 33:49.627
<i> Right there,</i>

33:49.660 --> 33:52.730
<i> I know
I have to make a choice,</i>

33:52.763 --> 33:57.468
<i> and I denounce the violence
against the students...</i>

33:57.501 --> 34:00.538
<i>And I become a political man...</i>

34:00.571 --> 34:02.139
like that.

34:02.172 --> 34:05.476
And I can never
go home again.

34:05.509 --> 34:07.244
Oh, my goodness.

34:07.277 --> 34:08.746
I knew you were
living in exile,

34:08.779 --> 34:10.648
but I thought
that was a romantic thing

34:10.681 --> 34:12.817
that poets did.

34:14.384 --> 34:19.356
Your life is...so sad.

34:19.389 --> 34:21.492
We cannot
choose our life,

34:21.525 --> 34:23.327
but we can shape it,

34:23.360 --> 34:27.598
and the meaning makes
all sadness beautiful.

34:27.630 --> 34:31.569
Ironically,
now I can live in China.

34:31.601 --> 34:33.471
They invited me back.

34:33.504 --> 34:39.176
Wait long enough...
and everything changes.

34:39.208 --> 34:40.444
Change...

34:40.476 --> 34:42.813
Change creates the meaning.

34:42.846 --> 34:46.550
It's what I write about.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.120
I really
loved your poem.

34:49.152 --> 34:52.223
But you couldn't
understand it.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.657
I don't know.

34:53.690 --> 34:54.725
I felt like I did.

34:54.757 --> 34:56.560
Maybe you did, then.

34:56.592 --> 34:57.361
When people tell me

34:57.394 --> 34:59.597
that they don't
understand a poem,

34:59.630 --> 35:03.868
I say, "Fine,
just listen to it.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.202
You don't need

35:05.235 --> 35:07.838
an intellectual
understanding of it."

35:07.871 --> 35:11.475
I liked the way
you presented your poem.

35:11.508 --> 35:15.279
I think of my poem
as music too...

35:15.312 --> 35:19.283
[chuckles] but I cannot sing
in front of an audience.

35:19.316 --> 35:21.285
You are very brave.

35:21.318 --> 35:22.820
Oh! Or stupid.

35:22.853 --> 35:26.457
Sometimes you need one
for the other.

35:26.490 --> 35:28.325
What is your poem called?

35:28.358 --> 35:31.362
"Mah."

35:31.395 --> 35:33.364
What does it mean?

35:33.397 --> 35:36.200
It means many things.

35:36.233 --> 35:38.235
Horse.

35:38.268 --> 35:40.237
Mother.

35:40.270 --> 35:42.573
Part of a sentence.

35:42.606 --> 35:47.878
A bridge from one word
to another.

35:47.911 --> 35:51.248
I would love
to learn this poem.

35:51.281 --> 35:52.516
You must
perform it.

35:52.549 --> 35:54.285
B-But it's your poem.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.786
I gave it to you.

35:55.819 --> 35:58.255
You must
improvise.

35:58.288 --> 35:59.924
Sing the poem.

35:59.957 --> 36:03.794
Performance is an essential
part of the poetry.

36:03.827 --> 36:06.864
You already know that.

36:06.897 --> 36:08.232
Sing. Sing!

36:08.265 --> 36:10.735
Walt Whitman.
"Body Electric."

36:21.445 --> 36:23.447
I have brought
the oracle...

36:23.480 --> 36:25.349
the book of Hafiz.

36:25.382 --> 36:26.717
Ask your question.

36:26.750 --> 36:28.319
Out loud?

36:28.352 --> 36:30.287
It doesn't
matter.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.656
All right.
I've got my question.

36:32.689 --> 36:34.792
Is it about Dietmar?

36:34.825 --> 36:37.728
It is <i> so</i> not about Dietmar!
Why should it be about Dietmar?

36:37.761 --> 36:39.930
Why does he hate me?

36:39.963 --> 36:41.832
Oh, I think he likes you.

36:41.865 --> 36:44.668
It is the way
some young men are.

36:44.701 --> 36:46.804
[pointedly]:
That's not my real question.

36:46.837 --> 36:47.871
Okay, then.

36:47.904 --> 36:50.541
Sorry if I spoke out of place.

36:50.574 --> 36:52.610
What is your real question?

36:54.478 --> 36:55.946
My real-real question?

36:55.979 --> 36:58.015
Of course.

36:58.048 --> 37:00.417
I want to know

37:00.450 --> 37:03.420
why my father abandoned me.

37:03.453 --> 37:05.590
Open the book
and choose a poem.

37:13.964 --> 37:15.899
[Mehrnaz]:
<i> There is a beautiful creature</i>

37:15.932 --> 37:18.636
<i> living in a hole you have dug.</i>

37:18.669 --> 37:21.472
<i> So, at night,
I set fruit and grains</i>

37:21.505 --> 37:24.408
<i> and little pots
of wine and milk</i>

37:24.441 --> 37:28.612
<i> beside
your soft, earthen mounds,</i>

37:28.645 --> 37:31.015
<i> and I often sing.</i>

37:31.048 --> 37:35.352
<i> But still, my dear,
you do not come out.</i>

37:35.385 --> 37:36.820
<i> I have fallen in love</i>

37:36.853 --> 37:40.891
<i> with someone
who hides inside you.</i>

37:40.924 --> 37:43.294
<i> We should talk
about this problem,</i>

37:43.327 --> 37:44.428
<i> otherwise,</i>

37:44.461 --> 37:46.964
I will never leave you alone.

37:48.465 --> 37:49.900
What does that mean?

37:49.933 --> 37:50.968
It's obvious.

37:51.001 --> 37:54.305
It means you are supposed
to perform Di Di's poem

37:54.338 --> 37:56.073
on the last night
of the festival.

37:56.106 --> 37:57.908
How do you think it says that?

37:57.941 --> 38:00.811
The true beauty
of the poetry of Hafiz

38:00.844 --> 38:03.647
is that every word
can be interpreted

38:03.680 --> 38:05.516
many different ways.

38:05.549 --> 38:08.952
That's what makes him
such an excellent oracle.

38:08.985 --> 38:11.522
I can't translate that poem.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.857
I can't perform it
in front of...

38:13.890 --> 38:16.694
Oh, yes, you can,
and, yes, you will.

38:16.727 --> 38:18.696
I have already organized it.

38:22.132 --> 38:24.101
Now I have a
question for you.

38:24.134 --> 38:26.437
Why does a young
Canadian woman

38:26.470 --> 38:27.538
of Asian descent

38:27.571 --> 38:29.040
decide to wear the <i> chador?</i>

38:32.676 --> 38:35.846
You don't need to
wear this, you know.

38:35.879 --> 38:37.881
But I have to wear
something, don't I?

38:37.914 --> 38:39.917
Might as well
go all the way.

38:39.950 --> 38:43.053
Hmm. You have a point.

38:43.086 --> 38:45.089
[crickets chirping]

38:56.099 --> 39:00.071

39:19.890 --> 39:22.760

believed such a figure,</i>

39:22.793 --> 39:24.828
<i> sounding as it does</i>

39:24.861 --> 39:27.531
<i> too much like
something rounded off,</i>

39:27.564 --> 39:30.801

39:30.834 --> 39:35.072
<i> invented out of thin air,
the thinnest on Earth,</i>

39:35.105 --> 39:38.642
<i>and added to the mountain's top</i>

39:38.675 --> 39:42.079
<i> to provide the appearance
of precision...</i>

39:42.112 --> 39:45.582
<i> 29 thousand and two.</i>

39:45.615 --> 39:47.618
<i> So too, tonight,</i>

39:47.651 --> 39:50.788

before the moon</i>

39:50.821 --> 39:52.723

40:12.476 --> 40:16.080

40:18.715 --> 40:20.818
Dietmar,
you seem nervous.

40:20.851 --> 40:23.687
Yeah. It's very intimidating
to follow Taylor Mali.

40:23.720 --> 40:24.655
You're gonna be fine.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.089
Don't worry.

40:26.122 --> 40:27.624
He's a really nice guy.

40:27.657 --> 40:28.759
He told me
I should visit him

40:28.792 --> 40:29.827
if I'm ever in New York.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.028
Yeah, but
that's not the point.

Uh, I'd like to read you
a love poem from my country,

40:54.951 --> 40:57.120
about, uh, the love

40:57.153 --> 41:01.625
some bourgeois women
have for their dogs.

41:45.602 --> 41:48.105
Oh, they really hate me.

41:48.138 --> 41:50.741
This country,
it gives a bitter taste.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.309
They don't hate you.

41:52.342 --> 41:54.144
They just didn't like your poem.

41:54.177 --> 41:56.146
How's that different?

41:56.179 --> 41:57.748
It's the subject.

41:57.781 --> 41:59.116
What do you mean?

41:59.149 --> 42:01.585
I chose it especially
for this festival!

42:01.618 --> 42:03.153
It's a non-offensive poem.

42:03.186 --> 42:04.555
It's about dogs!

42:04.588 --> 42:06.323
Everyone loves dogs!

42:06.356 --> 42:09.593
It was about women
taking dogs to a restaurant.

42:09.626 --> 42:11.261
Yeah,
it's a metaphor

42:11.294 --> 42:12.796
for consumerist
culture.

42:12.829 --> 42:14.164
Well, you don't do that

42:14.197 --> 42:15.332
in public in Iran.

42:15.365 --> 42:18.001
Dogs are...dirty.

42:18.034 --> 42:20.270
They are?

42:20.303 --> 42:21.939
We don't eat with them.

42:21.972 --> 42:24.675
It's very bad
in our culture.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.944
Personally, I like dogs.

42:26.977 --> 42:29.680
I liked your poem.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.683
But I don't eat with dogs.

42:32.716 --> 42:34.351
I thought your poem was good.

42:34.384 --> 42:36.053
It's not necessary
to say this.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.354
Hey!

42:37.387 --> 42:39.623
How could you have known
about the whole dog thing?

42:39.656 --> 42:41.358
[groans] Oh...yeah.

42:41.391 --> 42:42.793
Yeah, how could
you have known

42:42.826 --> 42:43.994
about
the singing thing?

42:44.027 --> 42:45.128
Exactly.

42:45.161 --> 42:46.763
[exhales deeply]

42:46.796 --> 42:48.298
Hey, do you know
what I can do better

42:48.331 --> 42:49.766
than anyone
else in the world?

42:49.799 --> 42:50.768
Hmm?

42:56.640 --> 42:57.841
Oh, that's stupid.

42:57.874 --> 42:59.777
[laughs] Try it!

43:01.044 --> 43:02.713
How do you do that?

43:02.746 --> 43:03.780
Practice.

43:03.813 --> 43:04.781
Yeah, why would
I do that?

43:04.814 --> 43:05.682
You're such
a weird girl!

43:05.715 --> 43:06.883

Ack!

43:12.989 --> 43:16.059
Ahh. Oh, no.

43:16.092 --> 43:17.928
Hey, hey.

43:17.961 --> 43:19.096
Oh, Dietmar,
are you okay?

43:19.129 --> 43:20.764
I didn't mean to upset you.

43:20.797 --> 43:22.966
Dietmar?
Dietmar, don't cry.

43:22.999 --> 43:24.368
Don't cry, Dietmar.

43:24.401 --> 43:25.702
I am not crying!

43:25.735 --> 43:28.338
I have angst!
I am doomed.

43:28.371 --> 43:30.240
I'm sure
you're exaggerating.

43:30.273 --> 43:33.210
Oh, no.
Look at my poems.

43:34.678 --> 43:35.346
Oh!

43:40.083 --> 43:43.887
Well, these are
quite racy for Iran.

43:43.920 --> 43:45.355
Mm. What is "racy"?

43:45.388 --> 43:46.790
Someone
at the festival

43:46.823 --> 43:48.859
should have given you
some guidelines.

43:48.892 --> 43:50.260
It's our first year.

43:50.293 --> 43:53.230
We still have
some bugs to work out.

43:53.263 --> 43:55.332
I'm reading tonight.

43:55.365 --> 43:57.000
You can jam with
one of my poems.

43:57.033 --> 43:58.101
What do you mean?

43:58.134 --> 44:00.737
Well, I mean,
I'll give you a poem,

44:00.770 --> 44:02.372
and we can trade lines.

44:02.405 --> 44:04.041
A-B, A-B, kind of thing,
you know?

44:04.074 --> 44:06.877
Mix it up.
It'll be fun.

44:06.910 --> 44:08.178
Oh.
Why would I do that?

44:08.211 --> 44:09.179
You've got to get

44:09.212 --> 44:10.080
back up
on that horse.

44:10.113 --> 44:10.881
What horse?

44:10.914 --> 44:12.783
I'm not going
to read your poem.

44:12.816 --> 44:14.685
You got a problem
with my poems?

44:14.718 --> 44:15.686
They're not good enough for you?

44:15.719 --> 44:18.088
Ah, it's not the point,
okay? It's not my style.

44:18.121 --> 44:20.357
Oh. Not...
Not political enough for you?

44:20.390 --> 44:21.992
Yeah, m-maybe.

44:22.025 --> 44:25.128
I found your poem...
a bit soft, you know?

44:25.161 --> 44:26.430
Soft?

44:26.463 --> 44:28.098
Yeah, I need
more balls.

44:28.131 --> 44:29.299

44:29.332 --> 44:30.967
You were just crying.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.069
I had angst!

44:32.102 --> 44:33.870
You don't like my poetry.

44:33.903 --> 44:36.373
[groans] What's with
all this French stuff?

44:36.406 --> 44:39.076
You know? Why...Why with
all the French references?

44:39.109 --> 44:40.777
It makes
no sense to me.

44:42.378 --> 44:44.414
But you've
never even been.

44:44.447 --> 44:46.950
It's the language
of romance.

44:46.983 --> 44:49.920
Well, you know, German
is the language of poetry.

44:49.953 --> 44:52.089
Well, Persia
is the land of poetry.

44:52.122 --> 44:54.324
Well, Vancouver has
more poets per block

44:54.357 --> 44:56.059
than any other city
in the world.

44:56.092 --> 44:57.227
Is that true?

44:57.260 --> 44:59.162
It's because
of the rain.

44:59.195 --> 45:01.932
Hmm...we say that
in Iran too.

45:01.965 --> 45:04.768
There is something
about the rain.

45:04.801 --> 45:07.104
Okay, I'll be there.

45:07.137 --> 45:08.472
I'll make it work.

49:19.422 --> 49:22.158
You want to challenge
yourself.

49:22.191 --> 49:23.994
You are just like
your father.

49:24.027 --> 49:26.763
He would be
very proud of you.

49:26.796 --> 49:29.699
How is it that everybody here
knows my father?

49:29.732 --> 49:32.035
You are on a search,
so everywhere you look,

49:32.068 --> 49:33.703
you will find...

49:33.736 --> 49:37.273
Oh, and Cyrus Kazimi
has told everybody.

49:37.306 --> 49:39.509
Everybody is looking
for him for you.

49:39.542 --> 49:43.580
Well, my father, apparently,
was a fighter pilot.

49:43.613 --> 49:44.581
I don't think

49:44.614 --> 49:47.283
he'd be particularly impressed
by my poetry.

49:47.316 --> 49:49.252
This is Iran.

49:49.285 --> 49:51.154
Everyone
cares about poetry,

49:51.187 --> 49:54.057
and your father
especially.

49:54.090 --> 49:55.625
He was my teacher.

49:55.658 --> 49:57.127
Teacher?

49:57.160 --> 49:59.262
He was
my poetry teacher,

49:59.295 --> 50:01.731
and, uh, he taught
me English.

50:01.764 --> 50:03.366
Very good, yes?

50:03.399 --> 50:05.802
[quietly]: English? Poetry?

50:05.835 --> 50:07.437
[Sassan]:
<i> He was a young man,</i>

50:07.470 --> 50:10.540
<i> and it was
when the revolution was new.</i>

50:12.375 --> 50:15.145
<i> A lot of people
took on new jobs.</i>

50:17.513 --> 50:19.449
<i> I was very bad in English.</i>

50:19.482 --> 50:22.685
<i>He said that I must not give up,</i>

50:22.718 --> 50:26.256
<i> that it was a window
into a bigger world out there.</i>

50:26.289 --> 50:28.625
<i> He wrote a poem
about a jet once.</i>

50:28.658 --> 50:30.727
<i> We liked those stories.</i>

50:34.797 --> 50:37.567
[Rosie]: <i> I can't believe
my father was a poet.</i>

50:37.600 --> 50:39.269
Because
he was a fighter?

50:39.302 --> 50:42.806
Uh, because he had
no compassion!

50:42.839 --> 50:45.108
Figures he would write
a story about a jet.

50:45.141 --> 50:48.178
Rosie!
It is a metaphor!

50:48.211 --> 50:50.280
For pushing your limits,

50:50.313 --> 50:54.317
for, uh, naming
your own freedom.

50:54.350 --> 50:57.153
Poets can be cruel...
[chuckles]

50:57.186 --> 50:59.589
But, uh, I don't think
that was your father.

50:59.622 --> 51:01.858
He was very kind to me.

51:01.891 --> 51:05.829
In fact, his name,
"Mehran," means "kindness."

51:05.862 --> 51:08.298
"Mehr" means "kindness,"

51:08.331 --> 51:13.136
the outgrowth
of love and compassion.

51:13.169 --> 51:14.270
But everybody's
name in Iran

51:14.303 --> 51:15.672
starts with "Mehr."

51:15.705 --> 51:16.673
That's true...

51:16.706 --> 51:17.440
but not mine.

I don't blame your father

Oh, God!
The translation!

01:01:09.364 --> 01:01:11.233
[frustrated sigh]
Oh, so slow.

01:01:11.266 --> 01:01:13.002
So slow!

01:01:13.035 --> 01:01:13.736
It takes forever

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:16.038
to go from
Mandarin to Farsi

01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.073
to English.

01:01:17.106 --> 01:01:18.474
It's killing me.

01:01:18.507 --> 01:01:20.776
I'm gonna fail
horribly

01:01:20.809 --> 01:01:23.179
and humiliate
myself tomorrow.

01:01:23.212 --> 01:01:24.980
I don't think so.

01:01:25.013 --> 01:01:26.115
Don't be so stuck

01:01:26.148 --> 01:01:28.117
on the perfect
translation.

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:31.087
Make it your own.
You know...

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.890
Coleman Barks is the most
well-known translator of Rumi,

01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:37.393
and he doesn't
read a word of Farsi.

01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:39.495
Is that true?

01:01:39.528 --> 01:01:41.030
I'm not sure.

01:01:41.063 --> 01:01:43.966
But the information
is helpful, no?

01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:46.102
It is
your poem now.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.436
Write your poem.

01:01:47.469 --> 01:01:50.139
Write what
is inside you.

01:01:50.172 --> 01:01:51.941
Write what you know.

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:55.278
What do you need
to write this poem?

01:01:57.346 --> 01:02:01.417
[guitar begins to play nearby]

01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:13.896

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:15.297
<i> Salaam. Bonjour.</i>

01:02:15.330 --> 01:02:17.266
<i> Quelle belle chador.</i>

01:02:17.299 --> 01:02:20.903
I, um, I know this is
a strange question,

01:02:20.936 --> 01:02:22.538
but I'm wondering
if you could tell me

01:02:22.571 --> 01:02:25.274
where I could borrow a guitar
for while?

01:02:27.009 --> 01:02:29.044
Wow! Um,<i> merci</i> .

01:02:29.077 --> 01:02:30.479
That's very
generous of you.

01:02:30.512 --> 01:02:32.448
No problem.

01:02:43.559 --> 01:02:45.261
Hey, that's nice.

01:02:45.294 --> 01:02:47.863
Aw, it's nothing.

01:02:47.896 --> 01:02:48.831
Just a cowboy tune.

01:02:48.864 --> 01:02:50.499
I can't really play.

01:02:50.532 --> 01:02:52.902
I just need it to write with it.

01:02:52.935 --> 01:02:55.437
Nothing like
what you guys do.

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:58.340
Where did you get
that accent?

01:02:58.373 --> 01:03:00.876
[chuckles]
I grew up in Paris.

01:03:00.909 --> 01:03:03.279
I just do this gig
with the Persian hippies

01:03:03.312 --> 01:03:04.847
every once in a while.

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.416
It's an excuse to come back
and visit family.

01:03:07.449 --> 01:03:09.985
I sure didn't expect
to see this guy here.

01:03:10.018 --> 01:03:11.086
You know each other?

01:03:11.119 --> 01:03:13.389
We roomed together
at the Sorbonne.

01:03:13.422 --> 01:03:15.090
You're from Paris?

01:03:15.123 --> 01:03:17.259
Have you, uh...
have you been?

01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:18.994
Never.

01:03:19.027 --> 01:03:21.096
Oh! You must go!

01:03:21.129 --> 01:03:23.933
It's crowded, expensive,
but it is Paris.

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.034
Oh.

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:27.303
You must be my guest.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.972
I can't believe you
guys are friends!

01:03:30.005 --> 01:03:32.341
How do you think
a no-talent bum like this

01:03:32.374 --> 01:03:35.044
could get an invite
to the land of Rumi?

01:03:35.077 --> 01:03:37.580
[together]: German
is the language of poetry.

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.048
[chuckles]

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.482
Do you
like it here?

01:03:40.515 --> 01:03:44.019
Yes,
but it's weird.

01:03:44.052 --> 01:03:45.554
It seems like every
other person here

01:03:45.587 --> 01:03:47.189
knows my father.

01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:50.893
But you are looking
for his story, yes?

01:03:50.926 --> 01:03:53.562
So you will
find it everywhere.

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:55.898
Someone else told me
the same thing.

01:03:55.931 --> 01:03:59.936
It's true. Look.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.405
[man]: Rosie-jun!

01:04:03.438 --> 01:04:05.407
You look just
like your father,

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.076
and like your mother too!

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:09.278
How would you
know my mother?

01:04:09.311 --> 01:04:11.247
Rosie, this is
your cousin, Ramin.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.481
My cousin?

01:04:12.514 --> 01:04:14.183
Yes, cousin Rosie-jun.

01:04:14.216 --> 01:04:16.252
Oh, how we know
your mother!

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.888
Your father only talked
about her and you.

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:20.656
He loved her
so very, very much.

01:04:20.689 --> 01:04:22.658
My mother is dead.

01:04:22.691 --> 01:04:26.061
And my father abandoned us
when I was seven.

01:04:26.094 --> 01:04:28.898
He did not love us.
He did not love me!

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.133
Oh, Rosie-jun.

01:04:31.166 --> 01:04:35.004
<i> When your father left Iran,
he had to give up everything...</i>

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:38.474
<i> even his identity.</i>

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:39.909
<i> He escaped to Turkey,</i>

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:41.210
<i> trying to get to a country</i>

01:04:41.243 --> 01:04:44.046
<i> which would accept him
as a refugee,</i>

01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:47.049
<i> but he couldn't get papers
because he had no money.</i>

01:04:47.082 --> 01:04:49.618
<i> He stayed in a detainment camp
with other men</i>

01:04:49.651 --> 01:04:52.488
<i> who were fleeing something,
mainly from Africa.</i>

01:04:57.993 --> 01:05:00.596
<i> But there were
all these beautiful beaches,</i>

01:05:00.629 --> 01:05:05.401
<i> and wandering along one day,

Rumi.

01:05:08.637 --> 01:05:10.472
Yes, Rumi.

01:05:10.505 --> 01:05:12.208

01:05:46.608 --> 01:05:49.679
I have no idea
what you just said.

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:56.452
"Now that I am with you,

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.253
I shall do as you do.

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:03.292
I shall sit when you sit,
I shall eat when you eat.

01:06:03.325 --> 01:06:07.229
I am the drunken drummer

Your kingdom, free of ego,

You, dimmed crescent moon,

Being with you

<i> She was young and curious,</i>

01:08:39.481 --> 01:08:40.716
He did!

01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:43.752
He contacted your grandparents.

and when your father
came back to Iran,

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:10.285
he took us in
like we were his own,

01:18:10.318 --> 01:18:12.353
and he put me
through university

01:18:12.386 --> 01:18:14.789

give his own daughter.

you endlessly!

that I only now see it.

afraid that if I speak,
I will not hear his voice.

I won't hear mine.
