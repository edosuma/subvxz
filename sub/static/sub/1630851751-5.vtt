WEBVTT

00:06.506 --> 00:08.807
NARRATOR: Worldwide,

00:08.875 --> 00:12.277
36 billion cameras
are watching us --

00:12.311 --> 00:15.714
On our streets, at work,

00:15.749 --> 00:20.452
and in our homes, they capture
things that seem impossible.

00:20.487 --> 00:23.722
Science says
this shouldn't happen.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.524
MAN: Do you see that?

00:25.592 --> 00:27.760
NARRATOR: Experts carry out
forensic analysis

00:27.827 --> 00:29.428
of these unusual events.

00:29.496 --> 00:30.763
Wow, what a blast!

00:34.134 --> 00:35.434
[screaming]

00:35.502 --> 00:37.136
This doesn't make sense.

00:37.203 --> 00:39.671
There has to be
some sort of explanation.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.875
What else is going on here?

00:42.942 --> 00:46.445
NARRATOR: Coming up, in a subway
said to be haunted,

00:46.513 --> 00:48.480
a stroller is pushed across

00:48.548 --> 00:50.949
a platform and thrown
onto the tracks.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.252
[gasps]

00:53.319 --> 00:55.821
We're watching a nightmare
happening in real time.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.590
We need to get that baby off
the tracks, now.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.295
NARRATOR: In British Columbia,
an inhuman hiker

01:03.363 --> 01:06.065
strides down
a treacherous glacier.

01:06.132 --> 01:09.234
If this is a man, what
the heck is he doing down there?

01:12.806 --> 01:16.175
NARRATOR: And a Thai takeout
that's too hot to handle.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.744
Boom! Whoa!

01:18.811 --> 01:20.879
What the heck just happened?

01:22.415 --> 01:24.950
NARRATOR:
Bizarre phenomena.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.251
Oh, my God.
[gasps]

01:26.319 --> 01:27.886
NARRATOR:
Mysteries caught on camera.

01:27.954 --> 01:29.188
[woman screams]

01:29.222 --> 01:32.958
NARRATOR: What's the truth
behind this strange evidence?

01:43.369 --> 01:47.106
Goodge Street Underground
Station, Central London.

01:48.274 --> 01:51.844
July 23rd, 2014.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.315
CCTV footage shows
a man carrying

01:56.382 --> 01:59.718
a child in a stroller down
the stairs.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.987
Nothing out of the ordinary.

02:02.021 --> 02:05.657
It looks like they're going up,
getting some more stuff.

02:05.725 --> 02:07.226
NARRATOR:
The man returns to the top

02:07.293 --> 02:09.661
of the stairs to collect
another child.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.131
Then, the unthinkable happens.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.966
Wait a minute.

02:14.033 --> 02:15.767
This -- this --

02:15.835 --> 02:18.237
Whoa!
The buggy is -- it's mov --

02:18.304 --> 02:20.672
It's like somebody's pushing
the buggy. There's nothing...

02:20.740 --> 02:22.074
NARRATOR:
A mysterious force

02:22.142 --> 02:25.043
propels the child
towards the rails.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.979
No -- no, no, no!

02:28.548 --> 02:30.149
[gasps]

02:30.183 --> 02:33.585
NARRATOR: There are over 250
miles of electric line on

02:33.653 --> 02:36.688
the London underground, and
the middle rail of the tracks

02:36.756 --> 02:37.823
is live.

02:37.891 --> 02:41.393
The track is pumped
with over 3,000 amps,

02:41.461 --> 02:44.229
and if you touch it,
you are toast.

02:44.297 --> 02:47.566
You can see the handles of
the stroller hooked up,

02:47.634 --> 02:50.002
saving the baby from coming
into contact

02:50.069 --> 02:51.403
with the live rails.

02:51.470 --> 02:54.506
We're watching a nightmare
happening in real time.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.842
We need to get that baby off
the tracks, now.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.580
NARRATOR: Even if the baby
avoids a deadly electric shock,

03:01.614 --> 03:05.350
subway trains traveling at
an average of 20 miles an hour

03:05.418 --> 03:08.187
arrive at this platform
every three minutes.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.861
WALLACE:
Here comes the mother.

03:15.929 --> 03:19.164
Okay, she's -- she's got
the baby out

03:19.232 --> 03:21.366
and got it back up,
but Great Scott!

03:22.735 --> 03:24.436
NARRATOR: The mother's instinct
to protect

03:24.503 --> 03:27.839
her child overrides
self-preservation.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.108
She has no idea
how lucky she was,

03:30.176 --> 03:31.843
because she was inches
from death.

03:31.911 --> 03:34.346
This footage just takes
your breath away.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.315
NARRATOR: The cause of
this near fatal event

03:36.382 --> 03:39.251
remains unexplained.

03:39.318 --> 03:42.054
The platform appears
perfectly flat.

03:42.121 --> 03:46.024
There's no slope, no incline
for the stroller to roll down.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.893
The stroller looks
like it was pushed,

03:47.961 --> 03:50.229
but there isn't anyone around.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.531
It's so unnerving,
because it's almost like

03:52.599 --> 03:55.534
there's an unnatural force
acting on that stroller.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.910
NARRATOR: Author Jeff Belanger
uncovers a history

04:04.944 --> 04:09.281
of disturbing incidents
on London's subway system.

04:09.348 --> 04:12.851
The London underground
is over 100 years old.

04:12.885 --> 04:16.388
It's the oldest underground
system in the world, and over

04:16.422 --> 04:18.123
the decades, this place has just

04:18.157 --> 04:21.560
amassed many strange tales of
the unexplained.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.496
NARRATOR: At Bethnal Green
Underground Station,

04:24.564 --> 04:27.666
right next to the hunting
grounds of Jack the Ripper,

04:27.734 --> 04:30.302
passengers and staff
report the wailing

04:30.370 --> 04:33.138
and screaming of adults
and children.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.342
King's Cross Station, scene of
a terrible fire in 1987,

04:37.410 --> 04:40.946
is said to be haunted
by a desperate woman.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.015
BELANGER: A man heard
screaming and saw

04:43.082 --> 04:45.751
a woman rushing toward him
with outstretched arms.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.620
He ran to help,
and she ran right through him.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.956
Others report seeing
an apparition

04:50.990 --> 04:53.558
and smelling smoke
at the same station.

04:53.626 --> 04:56.528
I can't even imagine that,
how scary that is.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.664
[woman screaming]

05:00.667 --> 05:02.834
NARRATOR: Physicist
Athena Brensenberger

05:02.902 --> 05:06.438
believes the stroller's uncanny
movement could be a result

05:06.472 --> 05:09.908
of a unique and dangerous
atmospheric effect

05:09.976 --> 05:11.710
that can occur
in tunnel systems.

05:14.614 --> 05:17.049
These tunnels haven't been
updated ever since

05:17.116 --> 05:20.118
they were first built
over 100 years ago.

05:20.186 --> 05:22.621
But the trains have been
updated -- they're bigger,

05:22.688 --> 05:23.822
more powerful.

05:23.890 --> 05:27.092
It's like taking a V8
supercharged car and putting

05:27.159 --> 05:30.862
it on a system that's designed
for a horse-drawn carriage.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.365
It's causing larger gusts
of wind to get pushed

05:33.433 --> 05:36.368
through these tunnels at
higher speeds and creating

05:36.436 --> 05:37.736
pressure differentials.

05:37.804 --> 05:41.340
A wind gust could be
what set the stroller running.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.078
NARRATOR: At the exact time
of the incident,

05:46.145 --> 05:49.047
any train leaving or arriving
through the station's

05:49.115 --> 05:52.117
tunnels should not have been
going fast enough to produce

05:52.185 --> 05:53.852
a large wind gust,

05:57.023 --> 06:00.258
but in the depths of
the London subway network,

06:00.326 --> 06:04.029
there are many other tunnels
hidden from sight.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.164
BELANGER: While the London
underground has been expanded,

06:06.232 --> 06:07.966
certain sections have been
closed off,

06:08.034 --> 06:10.502
while others have been
secretly extended.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.639
NARRATOR: One rumor based on
secret accounting figures

06:14.707 --> 06:18.377
suggests government offices in
Whitehall are connected to

06:18.444 --> 06:22.180
the British Secret Services
MI6 headquarters via

06:22.215 --> 06:24.883
a top-secret tunnel
beneath the River Thames.

06:27.420 --> 06:30.655
A classified spy subway
could be in operation.

06:33.025 --> 06:34.760
Goodge Street Station is close

06:34.827 --> 06:37.095
to several key
government offices.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.331
Maybe movement

06:39.399 --> 06:41.800
in one of these secret
tunnels caused some sort

06:41.868 --> 06:44.269
of vacuum that moved
the stroller onto the track.

06:44.337 --> 06:47.205
[beeping noises]

06:48.674 --> 06:50.542
[saw buzzing]

06:50.610 --> 06:53.545
NARRATOR: Engineer Nick
Householder builds an experiment.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.980
He wants to test the theory

06:55.047 --> 06:57.949
the incident was caused
by a secret spy train

06:58.017 --> 07:00.252
passing through unseen passages.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.688
Let's construct this tunnel.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.191
NARRATOR: He uses plastic
piping to replicate

07:06.258 --> 07:09.995
the station's layout at Goodge
Street underground.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.431
This represents
the rest of the tube line

07:12.498 --> 07:15.100
that comes up to
the station entrance.

07:15.168 --> 07:19.504
This little T piece is
effectively the station, with

07:19.572 --> 07:22.641
a piece connecting to it
where the stroller was sitting.

07:23.810 --> 07:26.778
Off of this is
the rest of the tunnel.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.416
Now, this section
represents what I think

07:31.484 --> 07:32.951
is happening in the tunnel.

07:33.019 --> 07:35.620
There's a second line
connected somewhere further

07:35.688 --> 07:37.789
on in the stream,
and there's a train

07:37.857 --> 07:39.658
traveling through it.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.828
NARRATOR: A secret spy train
passing through a tube tunnel

07:42.895 --> 07:44.463
pushes air ahead of it

07:44.530 --> 07:49.468
and creates
a partial vacuum in its wake.

07:49.535 --> 07:51.269
Air rushes in from elsewhere in

07:51.337 --> 07:53.638
the tunnel system
to fill the vacuum.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.776
This piston effect could
create a powerful

07:57.844 --> 08:01.546
suction force, which pulls
the stroller towards the tracks.

08:03.349 --> 08:05.784
This rag moving inside of

08:05.851 --> 08:07.953
the tube effectively works
like a train.

08:08.020 --> 08:09.688
It's creating a seal and can

08:09.722 --> 08:11.957
slide back and forth
inside the tube.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.425
I'm using this ping pong ball

08:13.459 --> 08:15.660
to represent the baby
in the stroller.

08:15.728 --> 08:18.830
Now, I'm putting it here just
at the entrance of the station.

08:18.898 --> 08:21.800
You'll notice this is actually
pretty far away from

08:21.868 --> 08:23.268
the tracks.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.338
I'm curious to see if a train
moving through a tube is

08:26.405 --> 08:28.740
actually enough suction force

08:28.808 --> 08:32.110
to pull a baby all
the way away from the station

08:32.178 --> 08:34.012
onto the tracks.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.382
NARRATOR: Coming up...

08:37.416 --> 08:41.186
did a secret spy train
suck up the stroller?

08:41.220 --> 08:45.223
Baby on tracks
in three, two, one.

08:45.291 --> 08:48.593
NARRATOR: And in British
Columbia, hikers take

08:48.661 --> 08:51.129
the vacation video of
a lifetime.

08:51.163 --> 08:52.597
Holy cow.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.677
NARRATOR: On a London
subway platform,

09:05.745 --> 09:09.047
a mysterious force pushes
a baby in a stroller

09:09.115 --> 09:10.482
onto the tracks.

09:11.617 --> 09:14.119
Engineer Nick Householder
believes it could have been

09:14.153 --> 09:16.054
caused by a blast of wind

09:16.122 --> 09:19.391
from a secret MI6 spy
train passing close to

09:19.458 --> 09:21.092
the station.

09:21.160 --> 09:24.663
He has created an experiment
to test his theory.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.598
HOUSEHOLDER: This is
the platform and the tracks

09:26.632 --> 09:27.966
that we see in the video.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.937
Here's the little hallway
where the stroller is sitting.

09:32.004 --> 09:35.974
Further along up the track is
a split into a second tube.

09:36.042 --> 09:37.509
I'm gonna see if I can generate

09:37.577 --> 09:40.045
an effect like what
we saw in the film.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.613
This piston is gonna
move through

09:41.647 --> 09:44.049
and potentially create
a vacuum behind it,

09:44.116 --> 09:46.284
and I want to see if those
forces are strong enough to

09:46.319 --> 09:48.153
pull the baby
from where it's sitting

09:48.220 --> 09:50.455
at the foot of the stairs
and pull it on the tracks.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.727
All right, here we go.

09:55.794 --> 09:59.731
Baby on tracks
in three, two, one.

10:01.968 --> 10:05.804
NARRATOR: The simulated baby
meets a gruesome fate.

10:05.871 --> 10:09.574
It worked! Just the train
moving through this tunnel

10:09.642 --> 10:12.544
produced enough
of a suction force

10:12.611 --> 10:14.646
to pull the baby
onto the tracks.

10:14.714 --> 10:17.549
This experiment proves that
a secret tunnel creates

10:17.616 --> 10:19.017
enough of an airflow

10:19.084 --> 10:21.820
to disturb the other parts
of the track.

10:21.887 --> 10:25.423
With this many secret tunnels
and hidden trains,

10:25.491 --> 10:26.891
you just have to watch out.

10:26.959 --> 10:29.594
NARRATOR: The British government
remains tight-lipped about

10:29.662 --> 10:32.697
its secret network of tunnels
under London,

10:32.765 --> 10:35.700
despite a journalist
claiming he accessed them

10:35.768 --> 10:37.836
through a hidden entrance
in 1980.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.006
But this experiment demonstrates
-One...

10:41.073 --> 10:44.075
that unseen forces can
create strange effects

10:44.143 --> 10:47.779
captured on camera in
London's subway system.

10:47.846 --> 10:50.882
These people really don't
know how lucky they are.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.084
This is every parent's
worst nightmare,

10:53.119 --> 10:57.355
your child spirited away into
the most gravest of dangers,

10:57.390 --> 10:59.157
totally out of your control.

11:03.195 --> 11:06.731
NARRATOR: Now, Panorama Ridge
near Black Tusk mountain

11:06.799 --> 11:09.234
in remote British Columbia.

11:12.071 --> 11:16.808
August 16th, 2014.

11:16.876 --> 11:20.612
Photographer Shayd Johnson is
out hiking with friends

11:20.679 --> 11:25.016
7,000 feet above sea level
when they spot

11:25.084 --> 11:27.819
something moving on
the glacier across the valley.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.362
Holy cow!

11:37.430 --> 11:41.132
NARRATOR: His phone camera zooms
in as far as it can to focus on

11:41.200 --> 11:42.400
the dark figure.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.070
MAN: Such a big thing for such
a, like...

11:45.137 --> 11:47.672
MAN #2: He's hauling it down
that mountain.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.076
- For sure!
- MAN: He's, like, just going...

11:51.143 --> 11:52.610
He's not on the trail, guys.

11:52.645 --> 11:54.779
This is -- this is not...

11:54.847 --> 11:58.650
- Wh -- why is he so far away?
- What are we looking at?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.985
NARRATOR: What is immediately
clear from the footage

12:01.053 --> 12:03.955
is that this is no
ordinary hiker.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.024
Are we all seeing
the same thing, right?

12:06.058 --> 12:07.525
Yeah.

12:07.593 --> 12:09.728
NARRATOR: There is no hiking
trail on the glacier's

12:09.795 --> 12:12.831
slippery slope, and the striding
figure is surrounded

12:12.898 --> 12:16.201
by deep ravines
and dangerous gullies.

12:16.268 --> 12:18.703
MONTANARI: If this is a man,
what the heck is he doing

12:18.771 --> 12:20.805
down there?
He's all alone --

12:20.873 --> 12:23.108
No backpack or hiking poles.

12:23.142 --> 12:24.743
It doesn't make any sense.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.414
NARRATOR: The fast-moving figure
appears to move down

12:29.482 --> 12:32.050
the treacherous slope
with astonishing speed

12:32.118 --> 12:33.718
and wide gait.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.987
How is it moving so quickly?

12:36.088 --> 12:37.622
NARRATOR: Until...

12:37.689 --> 12:40.492
MAN: Yo!
[echoing]

12:40.559 --> 12:42.494
It stopped.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.763
NARRATOR: The mysterious
mountain man is nearly

12:44.830 --> 12:47.665
a mile away but seems
to hear them

12:47.700 --> 12:50.068
and stops to stare.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.804
But no human signal like
a hand wave

12:52.872 --> 12:55.340
or shout is returned.

12:55.407 --> 12:56.875
MAN: I don't think
that's a person, guys.

12:56.942 --> 12:59.210
MAN #2: I'm [bleep] zoomed in
as much as I can

12:59.278 --> 13:01.746
on this thing.
- What the [bleep]?

13:06.185 --> 13:07.652
NARRATOR:
This figure is performing

13:07.719 --> 13:10.655
an incredible feat of
power and athleticism.

13:13.592 --> 13:17.228
The unedited video clip
lasts just over 60 seconds.

13:18.497 --> 13:19.731
During that time,

13:19.799 --> 13:22.934
the figure scrambles
approximately 300 feet

13:23.002 --> 13:25.303
down a slippery glacial slope.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.005
MAN: No way you can
cover that ground

13:27.072 --> 13:28.373
if you were just a person.
- Yeah, you're just

13:28.440 --> 13:29.974
going down the side of
a glacier? No way, man.

13:34.313 --> 13:36.447
NARRATOR: By combining
the distance and time taken,

13:36.482 --> 13:38.850
it's traveling at nearly
double the speed of

13:38.884 --> 13:41.853
an average human hiker
in this kind of terrain.

13:44.857 --> 13:49.027
Biologist Jayde Lovell
attempts to identify what could

13:49.094 --> 13:52.096
be moving at this speed
across the mountainside.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.499
LOVELL: In this type
of wilderness,

13:54.567 --> 13:58.102
it wouldn't be surprising to
see a lone wolf

13:58.170 --> 14:02.173
or a grizzly bear,
but when you look closer

14:02.241 --> 14:05.009
at the footage, you can see it's
not a creature on four legs.

14:05.077 --> 14:08.746
It's definitely walking upright,
like a human, like a man.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.290
- Coming up...
- MAN: Yo!

14:19.358 --> 14:22.560
was calling out
to the creature a bad idea?

14:22.628 --> 14:25.463
This sighting occurred right
on the edge of an area of

14:25.531 --> 14:26.698
Canadian wilderness

14:26.765 --> 14:29.367
home to a spate of mysterious
disappearances

14:29.435 --> 14:30.969
and brutal killings.

14:31.036 --> 14:34.339
NARRATOR: And in Thailand,
a mysterious motorcycle blast

14:34.406 --> 14:37.108
gives a new meaning to burning
some rubber.

14:37.176 --> 14:39.344
Boom! Whoa!

14:40.346 --> 14:42.146
Whoa, what is happening?

14:49.288 --> 14:52.190
NARRATOR: In British Columbia,
photographer Shayd Johnson

14:52.257 --> 14:55.326
and three friends film
a mysterious two-legged

14:55.394 --> 14:58.897
creature traveling down
a steep glacier at what seems to

14:58.964 --> 15:00.798
be a tremendous speed.

15:00.866 --> 15:02.667
MAN: No way you could cover
that ground

15:02.735 --> 15:04.202
if you were just a person.
- Yeah, you're just going down

15:04.270 --> 15:05.737
the side of a glacier.
No way, man.

15:05.804 --> 15:09.307
NARRATOR: British Columbia is
twice the size of California,

15:09.375 --> 15:11.876
and over 60 percent of it
is covered in deep,

15:11.944 --> 15:14.479
impenetrable forest.

15:14.546 --> 15:18.483
British Columbia --
Bigfoot ground zero.

15:18.550 --> 15:20.985
This is Sasquatch country.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.656
NARRATOR: Today, the Kitasoo
tribe who live in the region accept

15:24.723 --> 15:27.325
the creatures as being
as real as the bears,

15:27.359 --> 15:32.130
whales, and wolves that make up
the megafauna of the area.

15:32.197 --> 15:35.566
Indigenous tribes believe it
is a hybrid creation

15:35.634 --> 15:38.937
of ancient woodland creatures
that once roamed the region --

15:39.004 --> 15:43.841
A small, well built, dark ape
and a tall, thin gray one.

15:43.909 --> 15:47.312
The Kitasoo call them ba'gwi,

15:47.379 --> 15:49.948
and elders forbid humans
from going into

15:50.015 --> 15:54.085
parts of the forest that are
reserved as wilu'bu'kwis,

15:54.152 --> 15:57.622
which means the places
where there are Sasquatch.

15:57.689 --> 16:01.292
They tell people not to enter
for their own safety.

16:01.360 --> 16:05.096
Many people speculate that in
1924, a woodsman,

16:05.163 --> 16:09.367
Albert Ostman, was dragged into
a Sasquatch lair, where he was

16:09.435 --> 16:12.270
held captive until he escaped.

16:12.338 --> 16:14.806
NARRATOR: And science journalist
Shaena Montanari

16:14.873 --> 16:18.142
discovers this area of
British Columbia has gained

16:18.210 --> 16:22.013
a reputation for people going
missing in the wilderness.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.049
This sighting occurred
right on the edge

16:25.117 --> 16:28.052
of what locals call
the Kamloops Triangle,

16:28.120 --> 16:31.122
an area of Canadian wilderness
home to a spate of

16:31.189 --> 16:34.726
mysterious disappearances
and brutal killings.

16:34.793 --> 16:39.964
NARRATOR: Six men have gone
missing between 2017 and 2020,

16:39.999 --> 16:41.766
and despite a massive search,

16:41.834 --> 16:45.570
Royal Canadian mounted police
say only two bodies have

16:45.637 --> 16:47.438
been recovered.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.508
Some people blame Sasquatch
for these killings,

16:50.576 --> 16:54.012
but the authorities thinks
it's more likely these deaths

16:54.079 --> 16:55.646
are due to this area being

16:55.681 --> 17:00.218
a magnet for criminals with
high-end survival skills.

17:00.285 --> 17:03.521
LOVELL: B.C. has the dubious
honor of being known for being

17:03.555 --> 17:05.857
a haven for people
who are running from the law.

17:05.924 --> 17:09.660
NARRATOR: The small community of
Kitimat, just 400 miles north

17:09.728 --> 17:11.396
of where the footage was shot,

17:11.463 --> 17:14.365
was the site of a savage
mass murder.

17:14.433 --> 17:20.304
Kevin Vermette shot four
campers at a campsite in 1997

17:20.372 --> 17:22.573
before fleeing into the forest,

17:22.641 --> 17:24.175
and he was never seen again.

17:24.243 --> 17:27.645
NARRATOR:
Despite a $20,000 reward,

17:27.712 --> 17:32.150
Vermette, an experienced
outdoorsman, simply vanishes.

17:32.184 --> 17:35.086
He has evaded capture
ever since.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.488
GLOVER: Could a desperate or
dangerous criminal

17:37.523 --> 17:40.758
have made this mountain peak
his home?

17:43.195 --> 17:45.730
NARRATOR: But biologist
Jayde Lovell speculates

17:45.798 --> 17:47.865
this may instead be
a person who has just

17:47.933 --> 17:49.667
suffered a terrible trauma.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.504
They don't seem to have
any survival gear,

17:53.572 --> 17:56.707
any backpack, or any kit
with them.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.943
Are they someone in distress?

18:02.915 --> 18:07.185
Over one weekend in
September 2020, one hiker was

18:07.252 --> 18:10.788
killed and two were critically
injured in accidents.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.294
They all fell from
mountainside roots above

18:16.328 --> 18:18.029
Squamish Valley.

18:18.063 --> 18:20.898
[man shouting]

18:22.501 --> 18:24.569
LOVELL: This is very
dangerous terrain.

18:24.636 --> 18:27.738
23 people die every year
in B.C.

18:27.806 --> 18:30.041
from all sorts of things,
climbing accidents

18:30.109 --> 18:32.009
and injuries,
but also just simply getting

18:32.077 --> 18:33.945
lost and dying from exposure.

18:34.012 --> 18:36.581
Perhaps this man just
emerged traumatized

18:36.615 --> 18:39.283
after being buried
by an avalanche.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.686
NARRATOR: The mountains of
British Columbia produce over

18:41.753 --> 18:44.222
2,000 avalanches every year.

18:44.289 --> 18:48.359
A big one can release
300,000 cubic yards of snow.

18:49.394 --> 18:51.662
If you get buried
for more than an hour,

18:51.730 --> 18:54.499
you have only a one-in-three
chance of survival.

18:54.566 --> 18:57.568
Perhaps he was in a group,
and maybe he's searching

18:57.636 --> 18:59.303
frantically for his friends --

18:59.338 --> 19:02.240
It might explain
the lack of hiking gear.

19:03.242 --> 19:05.643
NARRATOR: But if it was
a desperate person,

19:05.711 --> 19:08.813
why don't they respond when
Shayd's hiking party

19:08.881 --> 19:10.114
call out a greeting?

19:10.182 --> 19:11.582
[echoing] Yo!

19:11.617 --> 19:13.584
NARRATOR: No one was recorded
missing that day.

19:13.619 --> 19:17.188
And the person, if it was
a person, isn't reported to have

19:17.222 --> 19:20.024
arrived at any nearby village
or town.

19:20.091 --> 19:22.460
We don't know what
that creature is.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.328
Is it a person?
We don't know.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.097
LOVELL: One thing we do know
for sure is that

19:26.165 --> 19:28.966
there's something massive
living out there

19:29.034 --> 19:30.501
in those B.C. mountains.

19:36.808 --> 19:39.110
NARRATOR:
Now, Pathum Thani,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.547
in the Bangkok
metropolitan area of Thailand.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.987
September 21, 2020.

19:50.055 --> 19:52.623
A man's dash cam films
as his car

19:52.691 --> 19:55.860
approaches what looks like
an improvised roadblock.

19:56.895 --> 19:59.163
People running across
the road, it looks like.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.866
Two guys on a motorcycle go by
on the left-hand side,

20:01.934 --> 20:04.101
and they're cruising along --
There are two chairs

20:04.169 --> 20:08.472
in the middle of the road
for some rea -- Boom! Whoa!

20:08.540 --> 20:12.376
[indistinct shouting]

20:12.444 --> 20:15.546
What the heck just happened?

20:15.614 --> 20:16.847
NARRATOR:
In the blink of an eye,

20:16.915 --> 20:19.116
the motorbike
and its two riders are

20:19.184 --> 20:21.652
engulfed in a searing
white fireball.

20:21.687 --> 20:23.754
Whoa! What is happening?

20:23.822 --> 20:25.456
Where did that even come from?

20:25.490 --> 20:27.425
[sobbing]

20:27.492 --> 20:29.393
NARRATOR:
Eyewitnesses are terrified.

20:29.461 --> 20:32.563
The motorbike's passenger
slowly sits up.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.498
The driver is yet to move.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.267
- Then suddenly...
- [explosion blasts]

20:36.335 --> 20:39.670
the victims are caught in
another blistering blaze.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.973
So the fire stops,
and then it restarts.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.109
It's like something's going
horribly wrong with this bike.

20:45.177 --> 20:47.278
It was like
a tiny miniature bomb

20:47.312 --> 20:49.113
just went off underneath them.

20:49.181 --> 20:52.316
Motorcycle accidents are
always dangerous because of how

20:52.384 --> 20:55.319
exposed you are,
but this is something else.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.989
[explosion blasts]

20:58.056 --> 20:59.857
What could have sparked
that fire?

20:59.992 --> 21:01.425
I don't see anything.

21:01.493 --> 21:04.562
Engineer David Wallace
is particularly interested

21:04.630 --> 21:07.665
in this case,
being a lifelong motorcyclist.

21:07.733 --> 21:10.268
When you ride a bike,
you're always inspecting

21:10.335 --> 21:12.436
the area around you,
looking for outside dangers

21:12.504 --> 21:13.804
that could possibly get you.

21:13.872 --> 21:17.074
You never expect it
to be your own bike.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.580
NARRATOR: In the U.S.,
motorcyclists are

21:22.614 --> 21:24.849
28 times more likely
to be killed

21:24.916 --> 21:28.519
on the road than car drivers --
In Thailand,

21:28.553 --> 21:30.554
it's even worse -- every day,

21:30.622 --> 21:33.190
39 people die on
motorbikes here,

21:33.225 --> 21:36.594
making it the world's
deadliest country to ride in.

21:36.662 --> 21:41.399
70 percent of all Thai traffic
deaths are motorbike related.

21:41.466 --> 21:45.002
It looks like my mom is right --
Motorcycles are a death trap.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.404
NARRATOR:
Martin Morgan spots

21:46.471 --> 21:49.807
a detail that suggests
this fireball could be

21:49.875 --> 21:53.377
the latest escalation of
a lethal turf war.

21:53.445 --> 21:56.247
The fact that we have two
people on this motorcycle is

21:56.315 --> 21:58.282
a clue,
and that's because in Thailand,

21:58.317 --> 22:01.285
motorcycle taxis are
enormously popular.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.487
All of the taxi drivers
on these motorcycles,

22:03.522 --> 22:08.059
they kind of carve out a turf
where they operate, and they

22:08.126 --> 22:11.162
don't want other people
muscling in on their turf.

22:11.196 --> 22:14.432
They're constantly at odds
with one another about where

22:14.499 --> 22:16.567
the boundaries
of their turf starts

22:16.635 --> 22:18.803
and ends, and it's almost
like it's created

22:18.870 --> 22:21.305
a motorcycle mafia.

22:21.373 --> 22:24.809
NARRATOR: Bangkok has
over 100,000 licensed motorbike

22:24.910 --> 22:27.311
taxis, all vying for business

22:27.346 --> 22:31.449
from just 6,000
official pickup spots.

22:31.516 --> 22:36.487
But then in October 2017,
a new unregulated ride hailing

22:36.554 --> 22:37.788
app is launched,

22:37.856 --> 22:40.491
undercutting the city's
already angry

22:40.558 --> 22:42.126
territorial drivers.

22:42.160 --> 22:45.363
The bloody battles start
to escalate.

22:45.430 --> 22:47.231
These turf wars are for real.

22:47.299 --> 22:50.701
NARRATOR: In March 2019,
a driver registered with

22:50.769 --> 22:54.472
the rideshare app is brutally
stabbed by a rival.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.741
VITTERT: Later that year,
two men were shot

22:56.808 --> 23:00.077
and killed in a battle
between two groups of drivers.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.213
These fights
happen all the time,

23:02.247 --> 23:04.682
and people get bludgeoned
and beaten.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.951
NARRATOR: This hair-raising
footage could represent

23:07.018 --> 23:10.087
the latest atrocity
in this bitter turf war.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.356
A rival group could
be responsible

23:12.391 --> 23:15.159
for sabotaging this rider's
fuel tank.

23:15.193 --> 23:18.129
So if the driver of this bike
has crossed into some

23:18.196 --> 23:19.330
rival's territory,

23:19.398 --> 23:21.732
this explosion could
be intentional.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.034
It would explain why
the driver's legs

23:24.102 --> 23:25.569
caught on fire first.

23:27.906 --> 23:31.475
ORZEL: Burning gasoline reaches
a temperature of over

23:31.543 --> 23:34.512
1,700 degrees,
and once it's on you,

23:34.546 --> 23:35.780
it's hard to get off.

23:35.814 --> 23:37.915
It tends to stay where it
comes in contact with

23:37.983 --> 23:39.884
human skin,
which is one of the reasons

23:39.951 --> 23:42.586
why napalm is such a brutally
effective weapon.

23:42.621 --> 23:44.955
You get burned by gasoline,
they're gonna have to cut away

23:45.023 --> 23:47.825
the burned skin to expose new

23:47.893 --> 23:50.661
skin cells, and then,
to cover up the scarring,

23:50.729 --> 23:52.196
they're gonna have to use
skin grafting.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.135
NARRATOR: Electrical engineer
David Wallace

23:58.203 --> 24:00.471
doesn't think
this is a fuel explosion.

24:00.539 --> 24:03.340
WALLACE: As we look closely to
this, we notice that this fire

24:03.408 --> 24:06.677
starts rather suddenly -- goes
bright, dims down, gets bright.

24:06.744 --> 24:09.914
Now, this is looking more like
an electrical-type fire.

24:09.981 --> 24:12.149
So is it feasible
that this may be

24:12.217 --> 24:15.586
possibly an electric motorbike
that has malfunctioned?

24:18.223 --> 24:20.991
NARRATOR: Wallace could be
onto something.

24:21.026 --> 24:25.729
Thailand has imposed severe
import duties on foreign goods.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.264
At the time of the blast,

24:27.332 --> 24:30.367
electric cars are subject
to 80 percent import

24:30.435 --> 24:33.170
taxes and e-bikes up to 60.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.574
This means
no one can afford them,

24:36.641 --> 24:38.642
and locals are improvising.

24:42.314 --> 24:46.250
Engineer and mechanic
specialist Rachel de Barros

24:46.317 --> 24:48.786
investigates why two chairs

24:48.853 --> 24:50.788
were sitting in
the middle of the road.

24:50.856 --> 24:54.291
I see something smoldering on
the ground, and then just

24:54.326 --> 24:56.293
above that, a black line.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.396
I think it's a power cable
that's just hanging there.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.570
NARRATOR: David Wallace
wants to find out

25:06.638 --> 25:08.906
if the violent explosions
seen in the footage

25:08.974 --> 25:12.877
come from
a fallen overhead power line.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.513
WALLACE: So here we have our one
million vote generator that's

25:15.580 --> 25:18.682
gonna be feeding power down
through the ring into the line

25:18.750 --> 25:19.917
to my right here.

25:19.985 --> 25:22.353
Now for this experiment,
we're only gonna be using about

25:22.420 --> 25:23.721
34,000 volts,

25:23.755 --> 25:26.657
which would simulate
a distribution line running

25:26.725 --> 25:29.627
along a highway
like you see in the video.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.796
NARRATOR: For safety, Wallace is
bringing the power cable to

25:32.864 --> 25:34.598
the bike -- this experiment

25:34.666 --> 25:36.600
should never
be attempted at home.

25:36.668 --> 25:39.203
What we have here
is our current sensor,

25:39.271 --> 25:41.672
which will be used to detect
the current flowing through

25:41.706 --> 25:45.509
the motorbike's frame whenever
the electricity hits it.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.345
So there's only one way to
find out what's gonna happen.

25:48.413 --> 25:49.680
Let's give it a shot.

25:51.449 --> 25:54.018
NARRATOR: Coming up,
Wallace finds out if

25:54.052 --> 25:57.221
these guys were fried on
their ride.

25:57.255 --> 25:59.123
Look at this.
We've got a good arc going.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.393
NARRATOR: And bizarre bird
behavior in Texas

26:02.460 --> 26:06.096
as a camera seems to capture
a feathered funeral.

26:06.131 --> 26:07.731
More and more you watch,

26:07.799 --> 26:10.801
the more and more
you get creeped out.

26:16.341 --> 26:19.777
NARRATOR: Near Bangkok,
Thailand, a motorbike is

26:19.844 --> 26:23.247
suddenly engulfed in a searing
white-hot fireball.

26:26.251 --> 26:28.786
Electrical engineer
David Wallace is

26:28.853 --> 26:31.422
conducting a highly
dangerous experiment.

26:31.456 --> 26:34.258
So in a moment, we're gonna
use my one million volt

26:34.325 --> 26:38.362
generator in order to
produce the power to my line.

26:38.430 --> 26:41.031
NARRATOR: He wants to find out
if the violent explosion

26:41.099 --> 26:42.533
that consumes the rider

26:42.601 --> 26:46.370
and his passenger is triggered
by a fallen power line.

26:47.806 --> 26:51.075
Just in case something
happens and the bike ignites,

26:51.142 --> 26:52.876
we want to be protected.

26:52.944 --> 26:56.347
NARRATOR: The motorbike is
emptied of all gasoline

26:56.414 --> 27:00.184
and oil for safety and to prove,
if there is an explosion,

27:00.218 --> 27:02.853
it's not caused by fuel in
the vehicle.

27:02.887 --> 27:05.956
Okay, so let's get ready
to light this bike up.

27:07.158 --> 27:09.326
Let's run the voltage up.

27:09.361 --> 27:13.597
NARRATOR: Switches are thrown,
and instantly, 35,000 volts,

27:13.665 --> 27:16.433
approximate to the power
running through the roadside

27:16.501 --> 27:20.304
cables, are coursing through
the conductor rod.

27:20.372 --> 27:22.506
A little more.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.242
NARRATOR: The deadly current
shoots down through the bike,

27:25.310 --> 27:28.012
but we're not seeing
the searing white hot flames

27:28.079 --> 27:29.113
from the footage.

27:30.649 --> 27:34.218
- Then...
- [explosion blasts]

27:42.527 --> 27:44.662
Look at this.
We got a good arc going.

27:44.729 --> 27:46.530
This is what we see in
the video.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.731
You get the flashes.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.169
NARRATOR: These white hot
arc flashes are

27:52.237 --> 27:54.271
just like the footage
from Thailand.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.375
As the powerful electrical
current breaks its circuit

27:58.443 --> 28:01.245
and jumps from the conductor
rod to the bike,

28:01.312 --> 28:05.449
dust and gas in the atmosphere
violently ignite.

28:05.483 --> 28:07.484
This deadly expulsion of energy

28:07.552 --> 28:11.488
generates heat up to
35,000 degrees Fahrenheit,

28:11.556 --> 28:13.624
hotter than
the surface of the sun.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.195
All right. Kill the power.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.899
This bike took quite a lick
here -- we had over 160 amps

28:21.966 --> 28:23.267
flowing through this bike.

28:23.334 --> 28:26.103
This is more than enough
current to kill you very,

28:26.171 --> 28:27.304
very quickly.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.640
So it definitely appears to me
that this is a broken

28:29.708 --> 28:33.110
power line that these guys ran
over that created the blast.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.313
NARRATOR: Power lines
run alongside roads

28:36.380 --> 28:37.715
for ease of access.

28:37.782 --> 28:41.385
But in a country like Thailand,
with frequent storms and poorly

28:41.452 --> 28:43.120
maintained infrastructure,

28:43.188 --> 28:45.355
low-hanging cables and highways

28:45.390 --> 28:47.391
can be a lethal combination.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.694
Both of these guys
on the bike recovered,

28:50.762 --> 28:53.630
and they were lucky to get out
of that alive.

28:53.698 --> 28:56.333
So if you ever come across
a power line laying on

28:56.401 --> 28:58.402
the ground, no matter what,

28:58.470 --> 29:00.671
assume this thing is live --
Never go

29:00.739 --> 29:03.240
anywhere near it.
Death awaits you.

29:05.510 --> 29:09.046
Now, Austin, Texas.

29:10.515 --> 29:14.752
September 15th, 2016.

29:16.554 --> 29:21.158
A man films a mysterious
gathering in a parking lot.

29:21.225 --> 29:22.793
MAN: There are more coming.

29:22.861 --> 29:25.395
They're not afraid of me,
and I'm right next to them.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.598
They're all hovering around!

29:27.665 --> 29:30.868
NARRATOR: The birds seem to be
focused on one of their dead.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.569
There are dozens of them,
and more

29:32.637 --> 29:34.104
just keep coming.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.572
MAN:
There's more all around.

29:36.674 --> 29:40.144
NARRATOR: The eerie congregation
ignores everything around them.

29:40.211 --> 29:42.412
MAN: Here's a big one
that just walked up.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.548
Oh, my goodness.
I wonder if that was planned.

29:44.582 --> 29:47.518
This looks like highly
organized behavior,

29:47.585 --> 29:49.987
like a kind of
group intelligence.

29:50.054 --> 29:52.389
NARRATOR:
Their avian attention focuses

29:52.456 --> 29:53.957
on their fallen flock member.

29:53.992 --> 29:56.860
But is it grief or a grudge?

29:56.961 --> 29:59.797
More and more you watch,
the more and more you get

29:59.864 --> 30:00.831
creeped out.

30:00.899 --> 30:02.466
[whistling]

30:02.534 --> 30:03.834
It's so sinister.

30:03.902 --> 30:06.303
It's like
they're planning something.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.641
NARRATOR: Coming up,
are these birds arranging

30:10.708 --> 30:14.411
a funeral or plotting revenge?
- When they're being aggressive,

30:14.478 --> 30:17.181
they'll peck and claw
at a person's head.

30:17.215 --> 30:19.950
It's almost impossible for
the person to fight back.

30:20.017 --> 30:22.986
NARRATOR: And in China,
an unidentified falling

30:23.021 --> 30:25.622
object brings fear to a village.
- [indistinct shouting]

30:25.690 --> 30:28.725
The terror that you can hear
cannot be understated.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.027
They are afraid.

30:36.334 --> 30:39.436
NARRATOR: A man films a bizarre
and threatening congregation

30:39.504 --> 30:43.807
of birds in the middle of
a parking lot in Austin, Texas.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.542
MAN:
There's more all around it.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.278
You can see the reason for
the gathering --

30:48.346 --> 30:51.782
Right in the middle
of the circle is a dead bird.

30:54.319 --> 30:56.220
MAN: It's like they want
to move it.

30:56.287 --> 30:59.289
Are they investigating
the cause of its murder?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.058
Avian murder investigation

31:01.092 --> 31:02.826
sounds like something
out of a cartoon.

31:02.894 --> 31:06.730
The bird detective is a wacky
idea, but the more we find out

31:06.798 --> 31:09.066
about birds,
the closer to reality

31:09.133 --> 31:10.868
this idea becomes.

31:10.935 --> 31:14.037
NARRATOR: Recent research
suggests that some species

31:14.105 --> 31:15.973
of bird can remember faces,

31:16.040 --> 31:19.409
learn about threats,
and even hold grudges.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.477
[cawing]

31:20.545 --> 31:22.613
Crows have been found to share
this information

31:22.647 --> 31:24.948
with each other
at a funeral-like events,

31:25.016 --> 31:26.984
where they gather
around corpses of

31:27.051 --> 31:28.785
their dead comrades.

31:28.853 --> 31:32.356
If we have bird funerals, and
that may be what we're seeing on

31:32.390 --> 31:33.490
camera here,

31:33.524 --> 31:36.360
then why not bird
murder investigations?

31:39.230 --> 31:42.699
NARRATOR: Crows' brains contain
1.5 billion neurons,

31:42.734 --> 31:44.067
as many as a monkey,

31:44.135 --> 31:47.504
but because crows' neurons are
packed tighter together,

31:47.572 --> 31:49.273
they are more intelligent,

31:49.340 --> 31:51.441
[engines revving]

31:51.542 --> 31:55.345
Some think as much as
a gorilla or a chimpanzee.

31:56.915 --> 32:00.717
Analysis of the footage shows
the jet black species holding

32:00.752 --> 32:02.419
this avian CSI

32:02.486 --> 32:05.622
are actually a type of bird
that's just as brainy

32:05.690 --> 32:09.793
and belligerent as crows,
the grackle.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.895
SZULGIT: A recent study
shows that grackles

32:12.030 --> 32:15.432
actually rank very high in
intelligence close to crows.

32:15.499 --> 32:18.302
We know that crows engage
in this kind of behavior.

32:18.369 --> 32:20.203
I don't think it's a push
to suggest that

32:20.271 --> 32:22.940
grackles maybe are doing
the same kind of thing.

32:24.175 --> 32:26.777
NARRATOR: If a grackle
investigation concludes

32:26.844 --> 32:28.412
that a human is a threat,

32:28.479 --> 32:32.049
that person could be in
trouble -- when threatened,

32:32.116 --> 32:34.384
these mass gatherings can
erupt into

32:34.452 --> 32:37.521
a violent defensive behavior
called mobbing.

32:39.223 --> 32:41.525
Grackles have a bad reputation

32:41.592 --> 32:44.728
in Texas for
their aggressive behavior.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.496
They'll steal your food and do

32:46.564 --> 32:49.299
all kinds of nasty things --
In Austin.

32:49.367 --> 32:52.836
They've learned to identify
fast food areas

32:52.870 --> 32:57.441
and trucks, and the locals call
them taco raptors.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.911
NARRATOR:
Just a couple of hours away

33:00.979 --> 33:03.580
from where the footage
was shot, nearby Houston

33:03.614 --> 33:07.217
was the site of
a major grackle incident.

33:07.284 --> 33:11.188
In January 2020, thousands of
grackles take

33:11.222 --> 33:14.257
over the parking lot of
a grocery store.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.227
Eyewitnesses say the birds
act aggressively

33:17.294 --> 33:19.363
and displayed no fear of humans.

33:22.066 --> 33:25.035
The size of these grackle
flocks can be huge.

33:25.102 --> 33:29.406
Eyewitnesses report
rivers of birds in the sky.

33:29.440 --> 33:33.410
In fact, bird attacks have
been on the rise everywhere.

33:35.446 --> 33:36.780
When they're being aggressive,

33:36.847 --> 33:40.350
they can fly at somebody
and vomit and defecate

33:40.451 --> 33:42.652
on them with amazing accuracy.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.622
They'll peck and claw
at a person's head

33:45.690 --> 33:48.125
and then come back in
huge numbers.

33:48.192 --> 33:51.428
It's almost impossible for
the person to fight back.

33:51.496 --> 33:54.698
NARRATOR: This grackle funeral
could indeed be

33:54.766 --> 33:57.100
the start of a feather-brained
hit squad

33:57.168 --> 33:59.336
hell-bent on revenge.

33:59.404 --> 34:02.706
And as birds seem to be
losing their fear of humans,

34:02.774 --> 34:04.841
perhaps humans should start to

34:04.909 --> 34:07.844
develop a healthier fear
of birds.

34:07.912 --> 34:09.813
SANFORD:
It's easy for us humans to get

34:09.881 --> 34:12.182
complacent about our place in
the environment.

34:12.250 --> 34:15.419
We've got weapons,
we've got shelter.

34:15.486 --> 34:17.888
However, some animals
have discovered

34:17.955 --> 34:20.457
that humans are easy pickings.

34:20.491 --> 34:23.527
I would not want to be
the person who killed that bird.

34:23.594 --> 34:26.630
There could be a feathery rain
of pain coming their way.

34:32.070 --> 34:36.406
NARRATOR: Now, Gaoyao in
Shaanxi province, northern China.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.549
September 7th, 2020.

34:45.616 --> 34:48.085
A normal day, until...

34:48.152 --> 34:51.054
[speaking indistinctly]

34:51.122 --> 34:53.256
Whoa, whoa.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.859
[shouting indistinctly]

34:55.927 --> 34:59.196
I mean, this is crazy --
Something falls from the sky.

34:59.263 --> 35:02.132
So you can see the villagers
in the footage.

35:02.200 --> 35:06.736
They can view this cylindrical
object dropping out of the sky

35:06.804 --> 35:08.271
towards them.
- [shouts indistinctly]

35:08.339 --> 35:09.739
Petrifying for them.

35:09.807 --> 35:13.143
NARRATOR: The huge object
continues its rapid descent.

35:13.211 --> 35:15.712
The villagers can be heard
screaming a warning to

35:15.746 --> 35:17.447
those below.

35:17.482 --> 35:19.449
You can see that
the people are terrified.

35:19.484 --> 35:22.119
This is not something that
you would see every day.

35:22.186 --> 35:24.287
They're yelling.
The camera's shaking.

35:24.355 --> 35:25.789
There is panic going on here.

35:25.857 --> 35:28.225
NARRATOR: The man suddenly
stops filming.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.360
Oh, no!

35:30.428 --> 35:32.662
- Still nothing.
- NARRATOR: Then...

35:32.730 --> 35:35.799
Oh! Okay. There it is.
Wow. That's big.

35:36.868 --> 35:38.869
That is a big explosion.

35:38.936 --> 35:41.104
This is not your normal gas.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.405
This looks sort of deadly.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.473
This is nuts.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.775
A giant object falls from
the sky,

35:45.843 --> 35:48.912
and then orange smoke starts
pouring into the air.

35:48.980 --> 35:51.148
This little village looks like
it's suddenly

35:51.182 --> 35:52.849
become a war zone.

35:52.917 --> 35:55.886
NARRATOR: The unidentified
object lands close to a school,

35:55.987 --> 35:58.655
villagers fear for
their children's lives.

35:58.722 --> 36:02.225
[indistinct shouting
and commotion]

36:02.260 --> 36:04.661
The terror that you can hear in

36:04.729 --> 36:08.565
the voices of the people in this
video cannot be understated.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.268
- They are afraid.
- NARRATOR: Shocked locals rush

36:11.335 --> 36:13.236
to where the object
has made ground fall.

36:13.271 --> 36:15.572
The blast crater looks like
something

36:15.640 --> 36:17.040
<i>from the Predator movies.</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:19.943
What has landed on this village,

36:20.011 --> 36:22.412
and just how deadly is it?

36:24.315 --> 36:26.950
NARRATOR: Coming up,
is the Chinese government

36:27.018 --> 36:30.120
playing war games above its
own people?

36:30.154 --> 36:32.722
Is it conceivable
that they're even allowing

36:32.790 --> 36:35.592
the North Koreans to test
missiles over

36:35.660 --> 36:37.694
Chinese territory?

36:45.069 --> 36:48.471
NARRATOR: In northern China,
terrified eyewitnesses film

36:48.506 --> 36:50.340
an unidentified object

36:50.408 --> 36:53.743
crash landing right
next to the village's school.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.981
I think it's
a pretty good rule of

36:58.049 --> 37:00.183
thumb that if you see
an orange cloud,

37:00.251 --> 37:02.452
it's probably not going to be
good for you.

37:03.454 --> 37:05.822
NARRATOR: Antonio Paris
looks for answers

37:05.890 --> 37:07.691
about this mysterious object.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.362
One of China's closest allies is

37:12.430 --> 37:15.098
the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea.

37:15.166 --> 37:18.501
He suspects Kim Jong-un
could be involved.

37:19.737 --> 37:22.639
Geographically, China is
very close to North Korea,

37:22.673 --> 37:24.207
and in the last 10 years,

37:24.275 --> 37:27.177
North Korea has been testing
a whole assortment of rockets

37:27.245 --> 37:29.279
and missiles -- is this
what we're seeing here,

37:29.347 --> 37:31.214
is something that
malfunctioned over

37:31.282 --> 37:33.416
China that came from
North Korea?

37:33.484 --> 37:36.119
McMAHON: The impact site
definitely says missile.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.455
It's a large hole in the ground.

37:38.489 --> 37:40.457
It's what every missile does.

37:43.127 --> 37:45.328
NARRATOR: North Korea is
an impoverished country,

37:45.396 --> 37:48.031
but it still has one of
the largest militaries in

37:48.098 --> 37:49.699
the world.

37:49.767 --> 37:54.237
It's estimated 20 percent of
its entire GDP

37:54.305 --> 37:55.672
is spent on defense.

37:55.740 --> 37:59.142
America spends just
3.4 percent.

38:00.177 --> 38:04.080
The North Koreans are nuclear
capable, and they have

38:04.115 --> 38:07.450
an intermediate range strike
capability now, as well,

38:07.518 --> 38:11.054
in the form of ballistic
missiles that can be equipped

38:11.121 --> 38:13.390
with a nuclear payload,
and the delivery system

38:13.457 --> 38:16.760
that they have can stretch
to about 8,000 miles.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.829
NARRATOR: Mainland USA
may be out of reach,

38:19.897 --> 38:24.100
but the Pacific island of Guam
is a sitting duck.

38:24.168 --> 38:28.338
And that is something that
should alarm Americans,

38:28.406 --> 38:30.440
first and foremost,
because Guam has been a part of

38:30.474 --> 38:33.610
the greater United States of
America since 1898.

38:33.677 --> 38:37.447
It's the site of a major
United States Navy base.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.153
NARRATOR: But Guam lies pretty
much in the opposite direction

38:43.220 --> 38:45.388
from where the object in
the footage falls in

38:45.423 --> 38:46.456
northern China.

38:48.159 --> 38:50.960
China could be helping
the North Koreans

38:51.028 --> 38:52.662
to develop their missile system.

38:52.730 --> 38:55.265
Is it conceivable that
they're even allowing

38:55.333 --> 38:58.401
the North Koreans to test
those missiles over

38:58.469 --> 38:59.736
Chinese territory?

39:04.842 --> 39:07.344
NARRATOR: Space journalist
Amy Shira Teitel

39:07.411 --> 39:09.646
reexamines the footage.

39:09.713 --> 39:12.115
Is this a spent rocket
booster stage

39:12.183 --> 39:14.818
crashing in the middle of
a residential area?

39:14.885 --> 39:17.520
The thing is, spent rocket
stages are usually jettisoned

39:17.588 --> 39:20.590
over water, not populated areas.

39:20.658 --> 39:24.260
NARRATOR: The Chinese government
space program uses former

39:24.328 --> 39:27.497
top-secret military missile
launchpads to blast off

39:27.565 --> 39:29.966
their spacecraft.

39:30.034 --> 39:33.370
These were all built in
the Cold War, far inland,

39:33.437 --> 39:35.939
away from the eyes of spies

39:36.006 --> 39:38.842
and the possibility of attack
by a foreign navy.

39:38.909 --> 39:40.210
PARIS: So that's an issue.

39:40.277 --> 39:42.479
If you have a spaceport
that's inland,

39:42.546 --> 39:44.247
and the rocket takes off,

39:44.315 --> 39:46.850
and then there's some type of
malfunction, that rocket's

39:46.917 --> 39:48.284
not gonna fall into the ocean,

39:48.352 --> 39:50.387
it's gonna fall on land
and potentially a city.

39:51.489 --> 39:55.291
NARRATOR: Falling space debris
is now such a common problem

39:55.359 --> 39:58.962
that locals are given
a warning prior to any launch.

39:59.029 --> 40:01.765
The Chinese government puts
out these notices saying that

40:01.832 --> 40:03.066
if you see something
falling from

40:03.134 --> 40:05.769
the sky near these launch
sites, you need to get out

40:05.836 --> 40:07.537
the way, you need to run.

40:07.605 --> 40:10.240
It struck me as
completely insane.

40:10.307 --> 40:14.344
Can you imagine if NASA gave
people warning of a launch

40:14.412 --> 40:17.147
to just run if they found
something falling over

40:17.214 --> 40:18.615
their homes?

40:18.649 --> 40:20.583
NARRATOR:
Further clues from the footage

40:20.651 --> 40:22.318
now confirmed conclusively --

40:22.386 --> 40:25.522
This is a booster stage
from a rocket.

40:25.589 --> 40:27.490
This gigantic orange cloud
that you see

40:27.525 --> 40:30.260
in the video is actually
rocket fuel exploding.

40:30.327 --> 40:33.663
It's a mix of hydrazine
and nitrogen tetroxide.

40:33.731 --> 40:35.799
These two things are
hyperbolic propellants,

40:35.866 --> 40:37.934
which ignite on contact
with each other.

40:38.001 --> 40:42.572
Hydrazine is an incredibly
powerful genotoxic carcinogen,

40:42.640 --> 40:46.176
So even if you survive
the impact in a village,

40:46.243 --> 40:48.978
you will have health effects
that could be deadly

40:49.046 --> 40:50.513
almost immediately.

40:50.581 --> 40:52.081
NARRATOR: And it isn't
just a problem

40:52.149 --> 40:53.550
for the people in China.

40:53.617 --> 40:56.052
The Asian superpower
is now starting to

40:56.086 --> 41:00.223
launch rockets that travel
all over the world.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.625
MORGAN: Recently,
in the Ivory Coast,

41:02.693 --> 41:06.763
a 40-foot-long section of
a Chinese rocket came down

41:06.831 --> 41:09.365
and crashed through this cheese
maker's warehouse.

41:10.668 --> 41:14.938
NARRATOR: And in May 2021,
the Chinese lose control of

41:14.972 --> 41:19.342
a 21-ton rocket during re-entry
to Earth's atmosphere.

41:20.411 --> 41:23.213
Traveling at more than
four miles per second,

41:23.280 --> 41:25.949
experts predict
the Long March 5B's

41:25.983 --> 41:30.019
debris could land anywhere
from New York to New Zealand.

41:30.087 --> 41:33.156
So here's the biggest problem --
China is trying to beat us to

41:33.190 --> 41:34.891
space, and they're trying to

41:34.959 --> 41:37.827
fast track this, and when
you fast track something,

41:37.895 --> 41:39.162
especially a space program,

41:39.196 --> 41:41.397
there's a chance that this can
be done unsafely.

41:41.465 --> 41:43.867
TEITEL: China is on a mission
to establish itself

41:43.934 --> 41:45.301
as a major player in space.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.070
So we're going to be seeing more

41:47.137 --> 41:49.172
of these rockets
launching in the future.

41:49.240 --> 41:52.742
If problems with launches and
re-entry persist, it could be

41:52.809 --> 41:54.210
a matter of time before one of

41:54.278 --> 41:57.680
these Chinese missions ends
with an international incident.
