00:02.080 --> 00:03.844
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.920 --> 00:06.366
Ava Crowder stole my money.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.841
Stole it from the man
who stole it from me.

00:08.920 --> 00:12.766
That man being your new
business partner, Boyd.

00:12.880 --> 00:13.880
Let's go.

00:13.920 --> 00:16.126
Now you're gonna have to make this
look good. How about you hit me?

00:18.320 --> 00:20.288
That look good enough to you,
you son of a bitch?

00:22.640 --> 00:23.687
Where is she?
She ain't here.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.761
Ava?

00:25.160 --> 00:27.970
You need to get me to that
money before I get to her.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.407
I'd sooner die than give you
anything you want.

00:34.240 --> 00:35.810
There's a
million dollars in there!

00:36.040 --> 00:37.371
You let me go, you can have it.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.682
I do not know
what Mr. Markham

00:39.760 --> 00:40.761
has got planned for you,

00:40.920 --> 00:43.685
but I don't want him
to do it to me.

00:44.920 --> 00:49.130
Looks like we can't keep the whole
Raylan-Givens-gone-rogue thing in-house.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.322
I'm gonna need a BOLO
issued for Raylan Givens.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.603
I just heard him tell the FBI
ballsack to issue a BOLO.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.801
Oh, shit.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.245
Raylan Givens?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.605
You're making a mistake.

01:07.680 --> 01:09.409
You know how many guys
have said that to me

01:09.480 --> 01:10.720
when I put the cuffs on them?

01:10.840 --> 01:13.684
About the same amount
that have said it to me.

01:15.080 --> 01:18.971
Guess you think reminding me you're a
fellow lawman's gonna draw you some water.

01:19.440 --> 01:22.762
The fact is, you having
that badge to hide behind

01:22.840 --> 01:24.365
just makes it worse.

01:25.040 --> 01:26.724
Watch your head.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.445
Where's the rest of it?

03:08.360 --> 03:09.805
Have a seat.

03:15.760 --> 03:20.163
Ava, you remember the first
day I laid eyes on you?

03:21.600 --> 03:25.241
I told you that for a woman
to survive in this line,

03:25.320 --> 03:27.243
she had to be
tougher than the men.

03:28.720 --> 03:32.167
Hell, any woman
who killed her husband

03:33.120 --> 03:36.124
and puts a bullet in her new fiancÃ©...

03:38.440 --> 03:40.727
My compliments on your grit.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.964
I'd say you had a bright future.

03:47.640 --> 03:49.483
Assuming you have a future.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.922
Your man, Boyd, stole my money,

03:55.880 --> 03:58.247
and you stole it from him.

04:01.480 --> 04:04.051
Were you just gonna
give it back to me, Ava?

04:05.960 --> 04:07.291
It's up the mountain.

04:08.800 --> 04:09.801
A little cabin there.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.921
Belongs to a fellow
called Grubes.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.331
It's buried on his property.

04:14.520 --> 04:16.045
That mountain's
crawling with Federals.

04:17.240 --> 04:18.844
How did you get
the money up there?

04:20.720 --> 04:22.290
I dragged it on a sled.

04:22.840 --> 04:24.285
All by your lonesome?

04:35.520 --> 04:40.367
I'm gonna ask you
just one time, Ava.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.609
Who helped you?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.882
My uncle.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.723
But he didn't have
any part in the taking.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.325
He just didn't want
to see me dead.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.444
Your uncle still up there?

05:37.560 --> 05:39.483
All right, for those of you
just joining us,

05:39.560 --> 05:42.450
we have one male
and one female suspect.

05:42.520 --> 05:45.046
You should have mug shots
on your phones.

05:45.120 --> 05:46.281
There's multiple agencies.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.523
So, all communications will
be on the common frequency.

05:49.600 --> 05:50.840
We've got air support

05:50.920 --> 05:52.922
covering the mountain
from the back,

05:53.040 --> 05:55.361
but anyone gets
a visual, call it in,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.442
and the choppers
will maneuver to that area.

05:57.560 --> 05:59.449
All right.
All right, gentlemen.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.249
That's it.
Let's move it.

06:01.320 --> 06:02.446
Marshals?

06:03.120 --> 06:04.565
Something here you wanna see.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.369
Dog team on Ava
tracked her scent

06:06.440 --> 06:08.090
to Tates Creek Bridge
half a mile away,

06:08.160 --> 06:10.242
then it ran out.
- Maybe she got a ride.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.004
Maybe she went into the creek.

06:12.120 --> 06:13.360
- What's that?
- Well, I don't know.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.886
But apparently, the dogs went
apeshit when they hit on it.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.849
Either of you know if it's hers?

06:18.280 --> 06:19.566
<i>All units be advised,</i>

06:19.640 --> 06:21.881
<i>the K-9 team has found
an animal tooth necklace</i>

06:21.960 --> 06:24.930
<i>at the Tates Creek Bridge that may
belong to the female fugitive.</i>

06:26.960 --> 06:29.611
Ask if the necklace
is gator. Alligator.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.682
Sit back from the partition.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.521
Please.

06:42.560 --> 06:45.643
Dispatch, Unit 17,
that necklace,

06:45.720 --> 06:47.563
any chance the teeth on it
came from an alligator?

06:47.640 --> 06:48.766
Over.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.683
<i>Unit 17,
all they'll say at this time</i>

06:50.760 --> 06:52.125
<i>is that the teeth
are about an inch long,</i>

06:52.200 --> 06:54.282
<i>and sharper than shit. Over.</i>

06:54.360 --> 06:56.442
Understood, Dispatch.
17 out.

06:56.560 --> 06:57.607
Okay, listen to me.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.727
You listen to me.

06:58.800 --> 07:00.928
This is the second time
I'm telling you to sit back.

07:01.000 --> 07:02.047
Ain't gonna be a third.

07:02.120 --> 07:04.407
So, you keep your ass planted
and your mouth shut,

07:04.480 --> 07:07.160
or you're gonna ride the rest of the
way in the trunk. Are we clear?

07:08.680 --> 07:09.727
Yeah.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.282
- I'll take it from here.
- Excuse me?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.441
Your prisoner.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.850
This fellow's on an FBI BOLO.

07:30.920 --> 07:33.969
I know. I'd like to be
the one to take him in.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.281
Not that your likes aren't
at the top of my priorities,

07:36.360 --> 07:40.046
but until those creds say "FBI,"
I believe I'll hold on to him.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.482
Well, you're right.
They don't say "FBI,"

07:42.560 --> 07:47.361
but they do say "Chief
Deputy," Officer Lappicola.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.282
So, you can either change
your attitude right quick,

07:50.360 --> 07:53.409
or I'll tear you a new asshole that
you can carry a watermelon in.

07:54.680 --> 07:55.966
Look, Chief, if it was up to me,

07:56.040 --> 07:57.326
you could take him right now.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.447
Well, who's it up to then?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.363
Lieutenant Mathis
is the duty officer.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.647
Well, lead the way.
Let's go see him.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.206
Come on, come on.

09:16.040 --> 09:17.804
<i>Uncle Zachariah?</i>

09:20.200 --> 09:22.168
Uncle Zachariah?

09:22.680 --> 09:25.206
<i>He can't get to
the phone right now.</i>

09:26.400 --> 09:28.801
Thank God you're okay.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.921
I was worried Boyd
might have gotten to you,

09:32.000 --> 09:33.286
put a bullet in you.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.126
<i>He did.</i>

09:36.480 --> 09:39.211
But believe me,
it was meant for you.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.563
Uncle Zachariah,
I've got some bad news.

09:43.640 --> 09:46.689
Mr. Markham has hold of me at
the old Bennett drying shed.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.401
He doesn't get his money
back, he's gonna kill me.

09:52.680 --> 09:54.842
Tell me why I should
give a shit.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.242
I told him you and me
are the only two living souls

09:59.320 --> 10:01.368
who know where that money's hid.

10:03.240 --> 10:06.210
Without one of us alive,
nobody will ever find it.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.922
That's the only reason
I ain't hung up yet.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.202
So, you're on your way?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.405
<i>You tell them to send
an unarmed man.</i>

10:17.520 --> 10:18.931
Meet me at Compass Rock.

10:19.120 --> 10:21.885
Compass Rock-Two miles
east of the trail head.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.130
Compass Rock.
We know where that is.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.928
- Good. You can draw Boon a map.
- No need.

10:35.080 --> 10:36.809
I'll take my girl along.

10:36.880 --> 10:38.291
You don't trust us?

10:38.360 --> 10:41.523
I don't trust anybody.
Not anymore.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.724
Except Boon here.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.291
Make sure that old man's
got my money. All of it.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.081
Yes, sir.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.571
Then kill him.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.968
Told you I'd get you.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.242
KSP found
Dewey's necklace.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.090
But no Ava.

11:14.760 --> 11:17.525
Which means Markham's
probably gonna get to her.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.170
Sweat her into
giving up his money,

11:19.280 --> 11:22.443
and then sweat her some more for
taking it in the first place.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.522
And now, Boyd's at large, too.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.126
Yet you're still gonna
take us both off the board,

11:27.200 --> 11:28.804
while driving me
back to Lexington

11:28.880 --> 11:31.611
for some bullshit
that you know ain't true.

11:49.560 --> 11:52.291
There. You dumb
son of a bitch.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.251
All right.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.882
Where do we
start looking for him?

12:17.280 --> 12:19.203
- Clear.
- Clear.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.730
We've got one body
in a shallow grave.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.484
Another went boom
outside the door.

12:26.560 --> 12:28.130
And neither one
of them's Crowder.

12:30.640 --> 12:31.846
We've got a runner.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.449
Boyd Crowder!

13:27.840 --> 13:28.966
Oh, God!

13:32.480 --> 13:34.164
Go, go, go, go!

13:38.240 --> 13:39.401
God!

13:53.120 --> 13:56.647
That gash on your forehead
must make you Deputy Stiles.

13:56.720 --> 13:58.200
Uh, is that supposed
to be a question?

13:58.760 --> 14:00.444
Sorry, fellas.
Wanna drink in here,

14:00.520 --> 14:02.409
you need a badge
or a pair of tits.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.601
Art, show 'em your tits.

14:06.960 --> 14:09.167
How about we start
with the badges?

14:11.560 --> 14:13.847
Sure, you can stay. As long
as you check your guns.

14:15.720 --> 14:16.846
Say what?

14:16.960 --> 14:19.691
A few years back, we had a
couple of guys get loaded,

14:19.760 --> 14:22.206
open up on their
fellow officers.

14:22.280 --> 14:26.126
Since then, I've been having everybody
check their sidearms at the door.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.045
You got a bunch of Eastern Kentucky
lawmen to give up their guns?

14:32.120 --> 14:35.602
Nice thing about running a
bar in a mostly dry county,

14:36.080 --> 14:39.050
as long as you don't water
down the booze too much,

14:39.120 --> 14:41.487
your customers will
put up with anything.

14:42.040 --> 14:47.763
Plus, I'm known for what you
call my powers of persuasion.

14:48.480 --> 14:49.720
Is that a Henry Aaron?

14:50.320 --> 14:53.290
I wouldn't know. Never
cared much for baseball.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.766
Me neither.

14:54.840 --> 14:58.890
You know, the only sport I ever
cared about was target shooting.

14:59.000 --> 15:02.049
Well, I know there's not that
much benefit exercise-wise,

15:02.120 --> 15:04.327
but it will keep you
from getting concussed.

15:04.400 --> 15:07.324
You know who could tell us
a little bit about that feeling?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.246
Deputy Stiles.

15:11.480 --> 15:12.481
Jesus Christ!

15:13.000 --> 15:15.002
Smarts, huh?
God damn it!

15:15.080 --> 15:18.766
Yeah, the doctor said you might
be sensitive to light and sound.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.040
Where's Markham? I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.490
God damn it!

15:23.560 --> 15:25.801
Look, we don't have a lot
of time here, all right?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.928
We know you let Carl
into Boyd's room,

15:28.000 --> 15:29.923
so you know where
Markham's got Ava Crowder.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.810
You are gonna tell us
where he is

15:32.880 --> 15:34.450
and you ain't gonna tip him off.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.568
If you do, we will
come back here

15:36.640 --> 15:38.210
and we will bring a jackhammer.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.965
If he's at the Bennett shed,

15:43.040 --> 15:44.804
it means Loretta's either
partnered up with him, or...

15:44.920 --> 15:48.163
Let's cross that bridge
when we come to it. Mullen.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.361
What?

15:53.560 --> 15:54.891
Anybody hurt?

15:55.800 --> 15:58.201
All right, just sit tight.
I'll be right there.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.849
Crowder started
throwing dynamite.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.560
Jesus Christ.

16:04.040 --> 16:06.407
Rachel set up a perimeter
and pulled everybody back,

16:07.960 --> 16:10.008
but nobody has eyes on Boyd.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.809
I'm gonna have to get up there

16:11.880 --> 16:13.484
before it turns into Ruby Ridge.

16:13.560 --> 16:16.404
You take the truck. I'll
have Nelson come and get me.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.527
Hey, and Raylan, no matter what
you find at the drying shed,

16:20.720 --> 16:23.530
whatever they've done
to Ava or Loretta, you...

16:25.560 --> 16:27.369
I understand.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.608
What do you mean
he's not at Compass Rock?

16:37.760 --> 16:38.921
<i>No, sir,
Mr. Markham.</i>

16:39.120 --> 16:40.406
Son of a bitch.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.246
This is bullshit.

16:42.600 --> 16:43.761
He should have been here by now.

16:43.840 --> 16:46.411
I don't pay you to talk, son.

16:47.200 --> 16:49.885
You know, it's occurred to me,
sitting here, waiting,

16:49.960 --> 16:53.601
that you're one of the few people
that knew Katherine played me.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.481
Maybe you think
you can do the same.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.884
And I won't realize
till it's too late.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.447
Zachariah is an old man.

17:03.840 --> 17:06.810
He's gotta haul all that
cash and avoid the cops.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.648
That's gonna take some time.

17:11.240 --> 17:14.368
I know you've had a lot of
violent men in your life.

17:15.440 --> 17:18.922
So, this ain't the first time
you've had a gun pointed at you.

17:19.920 --> 17:22.763
You ever had one stuck up
under your chin?

17:23.400 --> 17:25.607
Felt that steel
against your neck?

17:28.079 --> 17:31.721
I'm gonna make a big mess
of your beautiful head, Ava.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.600
I want you to tell me
what exactly was said

17:36.680 --> 17:39.286
on the other side
of that phone call.

17:40.320 --> 17:41.606
And I want you to tell me

17:41.680 --> 17:44.729
where you and your uncle
buried my goddamn money.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.241
What?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.161
Ah.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.847
Keep those gun hands
where I can see 'em.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.245
Lest I be forced to send this
corrupt little piggy to the morgue.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.402
I suppose this means
uncle is dead.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.604
And you don't have my cash.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.161
For a bona fide stoner,
you awful quick.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.490
Ava?
Don't you move.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.489
Last time you took
a hostage and forced my hand,

18:12.560 --> 18:14.005
you chose wisely.

18:15.680 --> 18:17.125
This time, not so much.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.090
Oh, you think I'm bluffing?

18:19.200 --> 18:20.804
You think I am, hillbilly?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.570
I wouldn't do that.

18:52.200 --> 18:53.247
Look at me.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.405
Look at me.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.251
God damn!
Raylan, your timing sucks!

19:19.040 --> 19:20.610
So I've been told.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.763
I'd ask you the number for a
couples' therapist, Raylan,

19:25.560 --> 19:27.688
but I don't think you're any
better at this than I am.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.121
I don't suppose that's
your blood on you there.

19:31.200 --> 19:35.489
That please you? Somebody show up
and do your dirty work for you?

19:36.640 --> 19:39.610
Well, Boyd, I don't care
how it gets done,

19:39.680 --> 19:41.728
as long as it gets done.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.450
Well, I guess,
in that case,

19:44.800 --> 19:48.122
you ought to pick up where we
left off in the woods, Raylan.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.484
There is another way.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.371
What's that?

19:53.280 --> 19:56.170
I pull, you put me down?

19:58.400 --> 20:02.007
Either way, I am going
to put you down.

20:03.760 --> 20:05.808
Well, Raylan,
here's the problem.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.445
See, I don't have
any more bullets in my gun.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.281
Try that one.

20:22.960 --> 20:26.646
Ava, now would be a good time
to get out of the way.

20:26.960 --> 20:30.089
Raylan, you mind if I ask Ava
a question before we do this?

20:30.160 --> 20:31.240
Knock yourself out.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.401
Why?

20:37.440 --> 20:41.240
We had the money,
we were home free.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.003
Honestly, Boyd,

20:45.760 --> 20:48.286
I put myself in your shoes.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.328
I did what I thought
you would do.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.369
I ain't doing it, Raylan.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.200
Yeah, you are.

21:13.760 --> 21:14.886
No, I ain't.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.527
You are gonna raise that gun
and we are gonna end this.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.644
Raylan!
You stay out of this.

21:22.360 --> 21:24.328
I ain't gonna
pull on you, Raylan.

21:25.760 --> 21:28.127
So, you go and do whatever
it is you're meant to do.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.123
'Cause someday,
I am gonna get out.

21:32.200 --> 21:33.840
And when I do,
I'm gonna kill her, Raylan.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.131
And then, I'm gonna come
and I'm gonna kill you.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.410
So, what's it gonna be, Raylan?

22:09.080 --> 22:10.241
The boys out
at Compass Rock

22:10.320 --> 22:13.608
haven't found Boon and the girl,
but they'll keep looking.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.850
Someone's gonna
have to drive 'em.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.604
Probably shouldn't be me.

22:18.120 --> 22:19.360
You wanna rock, paper, scissors?

22:20.720 --> 22:23.087
I'll take 'em. You follow.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.286
Done.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.931
Looky here.

22:26.560 --> 22:27.891
You shouldn't have.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.010
Found it in the barn.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.411
I asked Ava if
that was all of it,

22:31.480 --> 22:33.403
but she didn't seem to be
in a talking mood.

22:33.760 --> 22:36.730
Well, it's a long way to Lexington.
I'll see what I can do.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.202
And if Ava knows
where the rest of it is,

22:40.280 --> 22:41.645
and tries using it as leverage?

22:42.640 --> 22:44.642
What? You don't trust me?

22:49.600 --> 22:51.284
<i>You know I'll never
make it inside.</i>

22:54.320 --> 22:56.971
I can tell you where
the rest of the money is.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.042
Almost nine million dollars,
Raylan.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.967
You're trying to bribe
a federal officer now.

23:02.800 --> 23:05.406
I'm just wondering if there's
still a deal to be made.

23:05.480 --> 23:09.849
No. No deals. No outs.
I'm sorry, Ava.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.324
Why didn't you just kill him?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.047
You heard him.

23:21.960 --> 23:25.009
You know there ain't a cell
that can keep him.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.287
What's it prove,
letting him live?

23:28.840 --> 23:30.410
Maybe nothing.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.841
Stay down.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.123
I'm sorry about
all that, Marshal.

25:01.400 --> 25:05.086
But I pulled up to the barn just in
time to watch you two pull away.

25:05.320 --> 25:09.086
Seemed like maybe, yous was gonna
leave without saying goodbye.

25:10.760 --> 25:14.970
No, we had every intention
of finding you.

25:20.680 --> 25:23.604
Guess I saved you
the trouble then.

27:00.400 --> 27:01.526
God damn it!

27:19.720 --> 27:20.801
When's your flight?

27:20.960 --> 27:22.610
Well, in a couple of hours.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.484
Well, I wish I could drive you.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.681
You're not gonna get all
sentimental on me, are you?

27:31.080 --> 27:34.766
I was just thinking,
Ava's still out there.

27:35.200 --> 27:38.488
Maybe I should stay a couple of
days, help run her to ground.

27:38.560 --> 27:41.086
She's not gonna get far,
running without money.

27:41.400 --> 27:44.131
Nine million dollars in those
hills still unaccounted for.

27:44.320 --> 27:46.402
You really think she's gonna
be able to find that?

27:46.480 --> 27:48.562
The place is crawling with LEOs.

27:48.640 --> 27:49.846
Just...

27:50.880 --> 27:53.451
Something feels
somehow incomplete.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.006
I asked you to come to Kentucky

27:59.080 --> 28:01.082
and help us get Boyd Crowder.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.651
Now, it took a little longer
than I originally anticipated,

28:06.280 --> 28:09.250
but you did it,
you got Boyd Crowder.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.085
And you got him right.

28:16.960 --> 28:18.689
You tell Winona
I said, "Hey."

28:19.120 --> 28:20.680
I still don't know
what she sees in you.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.205
It would be weird if you did.

28:22.280 --> 28:23.281
Hold up.

28:41.760 --> 28:43.489
I've got the Seattle chief
on the line.

28:43.560 --> 28:44.721
Where's Rachel?

28:45.040 --> 28:46.451
She'll be here in two.

28:50.840 --> 28:51.921
I'll miss you, Raylan.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.207
Nah, you won't.

29:08.160 --> 29:09.844
You can mail it back from Miami.

29:14.000 --> 29:18.050
Well, I hope you get someone at this
desk that's less of a pain in the ass.

29:18.120 --> 29:21.283
Not likely there's someone who's
more of a pain in the ass.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.886
I just hope it's someone
who can keep up.

29:33.040 --> 29:34.849
You read that a bunch
or you buy it used?

29:35.320 --> 29:38.210
If I say I've read it
10 times, I'm low.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.490
Still want my bag back.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.367
Nice hat.

29:54.920 --> 29:56.888
I tried it on and it fit.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.965
<i>You're gonna
read that book, Tim?</i>

30:06.040 --> 30:08.202
<i>No, Nelson,
I'm gonna eat it.</i>

30:08.280 --> 30:09.930
<i>I read fast. I'll
have it back to you tomorrow.</i>

30:10.000 --> 30:12.731
<i>Keep talking, I'm gonna
throw my stapler at you.</i>

30:26.800 --> 30:29.246
<i>- Worst possible flavor?
- How bad?</i>

30:29.560 --> 30:31.528
So bad, I wouldn't eat it.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.046
Hmm. Fish guts.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.410
Sounds delicious.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.443
Sand. From a playground.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.923
Close, very close, but no.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.645
That a dog pooped in.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.765
That's a good one.
We have a winner.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.324
Tell your mom I gave you that
for reciting the alphabet.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.528
Can I go play now?
Sure.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.969
So much for the kale salad.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.401
Calcium is very important
for young bones.

31:19.520 --> 31:22.126
Yeah, that's why
I give her kale, jerk.

31:24.560 --> 31:25.891
Thank you.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.649
They got the model right when
they made her at the factory.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.921
Mom, Dad gave me a dollar
for saying the alphabet.

31:39.040 --> 31:40.530
Wow!

31:40.600 --> 31:42.489
You'll thank me when
she gets a gold star.

31:42.560 --> 31:44.324
Can Daddy come for dinner?

31:45.480 --> 31:46.970
Would you like to join us?

31:47.040 --> 31:48.087
Richard's parents are in town,

31:48.160 --> 31:50.208
so he's been cooking up a storm.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.850
Oh, I should take a rain check.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.161
Sutter called as if
the office was on fire.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.891
No telling how long
it'll take me to put it out.

31:57.240 --> 31:59.208
Hey, Richard.
Raylan.

31:59.280 --> 32:02.443
Richard, my daddy and I found a baby frog.
Can we take it home?

32:03.920 --> 32:06.446
Sure, punk.
You found a name yet?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.965
Not yet.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.805
Okay, we can do it in the car.

32:09.880 --> 32:11.848
Nana and Grandpa
are coming over.

32:11.920 --> 32:13.570
Wanna say goodbye?
Goodbye, Daddy.

32:13.640 --> 32:14.641
Bye, Willa.

32:17.120 --> 32:19.248
Uh, frogs are her new passion.

32:19.320 --> 32:22.608
I'm afraid I'm gonna find one in her bed
instead of Mr. Bear one of these nights.

32:22.680 --> 32:24.125
Why does he call her "punk"?

32:24.200 --> 32:25.645
Oh, don't start.

32:25.720 --> 32:28.929
I could explain what I do for a living.
I run into punks all day.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.161
It's short for punkin, Raylan.

32:30.240 --> 32:32.129
Nonetheless, it has
other connotations.

32:32.200 --> 32:35.568
Oh, my God. You're the most
stubborn man I have ever known.

32:35.680 --> 32:37.011
Beats angry.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.360
You know, you gave her a dollar
for reciting the alphabet,

32:42.480 --> 32:44.360
which is something
she's been doing since April.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.647
I love the way she says

32:46.720 --> 32:50.042
Man, she really
knows how to play you.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.281
Mmm.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.160
Can you pick her up
on Wednesday after school?

32:53.800 --> 32:55.962
I can and I will.
See you then.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.645
We get a line on Brancato?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.484
No, still
watching the mother.

33:20.600 --> 33:21.600
What then?

33:21.640 --> 33:25.122
Bennett has food poisoning, so you're
gonna transport a prisoner to Glades.

33:26.040 --> 33:29.249
- You can't do it because...
- I'm on the Brancato hunt.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.806
You're a dick.

33:32.120 --> 33:34.282
A dick that doesn't
have to drive to Glades.

33:34.600 --> 33:35.886
Right, Charlie?

34:46.320 --> 34:47.525
You ain't gonna invite me in?

34:48.239 --> 34:51.449
All I got's water and water.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.648
No Coca-Cola or RC?

34:57.520 --> 34:58.681
Coffee?

34:59.280 --> 35:01.760
I have a hard time
sleeping as it is.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.410
I imagine.

35:07.360 --> 35:10.091
I would invite you in,
but the place is a mess.

35:11.360 --> 35:14.443
Besides, I wanna
enjoy being outside.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.165
We can walk if you want.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.165
As long as you leave behind what I
assume is a rifle in your hand.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.008
It's an old family ranch.

35:29.080 --> 35:34.291
Broken up 20 years ago in what I
understand was bitter acrimony.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.649
I'm staying in
the caretaker's house.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.722
Yeah, it is spectacular.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.962
And while I'm curious
as to how you got here,

35:41.040 --> 35:44.249
what I'd first like to know is who
helped you get out of Harlan?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.731
Who says anyone did?

35:45.800 --> 35:47.484
When they found my car,
engine was warm.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.961
They'd have found you
if you were on foot.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.048
I was hitchhiking.

35:54.120 --> 35:55.724
Lucky you,

35:55.840 --> 35:58.411
getting someone who doesn't mind
picking up a woman in handcuffs

35:58.480 --> 36:00.209
and can also get you
past roadblocks.

36:01.080 --> 36:04.243
<i>We went down a list trying to
figure out who helped you.</i>

36:04.320 --> 36:06.129
<i>Thought for a while
it was Ellen May.</i>

36:06.200 --> 36:08.441
<i>But her WitSec marshal could
account for her that day.</i>

36:09.240 --> 36:11.049
<i>We looked at Limehouse,</i>

36:11.120 --> 36:13.771
<i>but found he'd left Nobles
the day before.</i>

36:14.240 --> 36:17.528
<i>My best guess has
always been Wynn Duffy.</i>

36:17.600 --> 36:21.446
<i>He gets you out of Harlan in exchange
for the location of the money.</i>

36:22.080 --> 36:26.688
<i>If there's anyone who can get you
by a roadblock, it's Wynn Duffy.</i>

36:26.760 --> 36:30.128
<i>If I give you a name,
I'm betraying their trust.</i>

36:30.200 --> 36:32.806
Even if it is Duffy,
don't worry.

36:32.880 --> 36:35.247
He's vanished from
the face of the Earth.

36:35.320 --> 36:38.369
Rumors of him
surfing in Fiji. That's it.

36:38.440 --> 36:39.646
How did you find me?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.682
A junior deputy
in the Seattle office

36:43.760 --> 36:46.809
was scouring local newspapers
west of the Continental Divide.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.042
He saw someone looked,
maybe could be you

36:49.120 --> 36:52.408
in the background of a newspaper
picture about a pumpkin patch.

36:52.520 --> 36:54.568
Shouldn't have gone there.

36:54.640 --> 36:57.849
Pumpkins were expensive,
even for California.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.608
The one I bought had rot.

37:03.320 --> 37:06.164
How are you making ends meet?
Cutting hair?

37:07.480 --> 37:09.130
I done thought
you'd be looking for that.

37:09.200 --> 37:11.089
So no, I haven't held scissors

37:11.160 --> 37:13.640
and a comb in my hands
since I left Harlan.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.721
Connie, the lady
that owns the parcel,

37:16.800 --> 37:20.441
she uses horses to work
with special needs kids.

37:20.520 --> 37:23.046
I help with that mostly.

37:23.120 --> 37:25.930
Hand out helmets,
do some sidewalking.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.891
I look after the big house, muck
and feed 'em when she's not around

37:31.840 --> 37:33.968
and I work at the school
in town and I also...

37:34.040 --> 37:35.530
I volunteer at
the church sometimes...

37:35.600 --> 37:36.931
You trying to talk me out
of taking you in

37:37.000 --> 37:38.889
or are you shooting
straight for sainthood?

37:41.000 --> 37:42.764
You gonna take me in?

37:42.840 --> 37:44.763
You ran on me, Ava.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.604
Three times.
Once at gunpoint.

37:46.680 --> 37:50.480
It's not like you're finding me here
running whores or robbing banks?

37:50.560 --> 37:53.131
Every long-time fugitive
I've ever run down

37:53.200 --> 37:55.282
expects me to congratulate them

37:55.360 --> 37:59.206
for not doing what no one's
supposed to be doing anyhow.

38:04.960 --> 38:07.042
I'm gonna show you something.

38:07.120 --> 38:10.249
But you gotta promise me you won't
breathe a word to Boyd about it.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.728
I don't intend to see Boyd
again in this life. Promise!

38:13.800 --> 38:17.725
Or you can cuff me now and put
me in the back of your car.

38:20.160 --> 38:22.367
So what's the big secret?

38:22.440 --> 38:24.647
You got a bear chained up
back here?

38:25.880 --> 38:30.249
It's okay, honey. You can come out now.
It's just an old friend.

38:34.360 --> 38:35.361
Of course.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.403
We were looking for a woman,
not a pregnant woman.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.530
Now you know why
I made you promise.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.729
I can't have Boyd
even knowing he exists.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.121
I'm not saying
he'd cause him harm.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.770
He'd just ruin his life.

39:00.600 --> 39:01.806
What's his name?

39:01.880 --> 39:03.530
Zachariah.

39:05.280 --> 39:08.489
The only man in my life who
never wanted anything from me.

39:11.440 --> 39:13.966
If we're gonna take this
to the next step,

39:14.080 --> 39:16.082
I need to know that he's set up.

39:16.920 --> 39:20.402
- Now, there's a couple two ranches over...
- Ava, stop.

39:20.480 --> 39:23.006
I ain't gonna take you in.

39:25.520 --> 39:26.806
Oh.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.883
Looks like you feed him well.

39:33.640 --> 39:35.290
Put clothes on his back.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.167
You play with him?
You read to him?

39:38.400 --> 39:39.401
Mmm-hmm.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.805
Thank you.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.171
I said you'd be fine.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.483
Now hopefully
you can sleep better.

39:54.200 --> 39:58.250
You're not the only one I've been
afraid to see at my front door.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.444
<i>There I was</i>

40:02.520 --> 40:05.763
in the middle of
the Mexican desert,

40:05.880 --> 40:09.089
driving a truck filled with
the bodies of murdered men,

40:09.160 --> 40:12.528
followed by a car
with a trunkload of heroin.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.489
I know what you're thinking.

40:14.560 --> 40:16.608
I see you nodding.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.091
You thinking, "God damn, Boyd!

40:18.160 --> 40:20.845
"How many times I got to
listen to this story?"

40:20.920 --> 40:23.161
Well, as many as it takes.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.926
'Cause if that's what you
thinking, you missing the point.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.647
I had to lose it all
before I saw the light.

40:31.720 --> 40:33.848
And do you know why?

40:35.120 --> 40:37.088
I succumbed to temptation.

40:37.160 --> 40:41.210
Now, any man can
walk towards temptation.

40:42.200 --> 40:46.205
But it takes a real man
to walk away from it.

40:47.120 --> 40:49.009
And when I say "walk,"

40:49.080 --> 40:51.287
I mean, keep on walking!

40:52.040 --> 40:53.280
Turn around!

40:53.360 --> 40:56.648
Walk another direction!
Climb up that ladder!

40:56.720 --> 40:59.564
Say, "Get behind me, devil.
Get behind me, devil."

40:59.640 --> 41:01.369
Don't look down!

41:01.440 --> 41:04.125
I'm gonna keep climbing that ladder!
I've got wind in my face!

41:04.200 --> 41:05.770
- Crowder!
- I don't know...

41:07.040 --> 41:08.565
You have a visitor.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.328
Well, today ain't visiting
day, Officer Cregger.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.084
Not that kind of visitor.

41:16.560 --> 41:18.528
To be continued.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.690
Raylan Givens.

41:42.600 --> 41:46.047
To what do I owe
this unexpected surprise?

41:46.120 --> 41:49.010
I hear you're preaching again.
Gathering a flock.

41:49.080 --> 41:51.651
Just spreading the word
of my calamitous fall

41:51.720 --> 41:54.530
and subsequent rebirth in the
light of the Lord, Raylan.

41:54.600 --> 41:57.001
You know you're
repeating yourself, right?

42:00.120 --> 42:01.326
Raylan Givens, I know

42:01.400 --> 42:06.042
you have never believed a word
that has come out of my mouth.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.806
Though I have harbored
the secret hope

42:09.920 --> 42:12.890
that you have nevertheless
enjoyed hearing them.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.726
Well, of all the nonsense
I've heard you spin,

42:16.800 --> 42:18.962
such as "the blacks
are the problem,

42:19.040 --> 42:20.451
"the Jews are the mud people,"

42:21.920 --> 42:23.763
I will grant you one thing.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.888
I do believe you loved Ava.

42:30.800 --> 42:32.086
Did you find her?

42:34.160 --> 42:35.491
We did.

42:37.840 --> 42:38.966
Where?

42:42.400 --> 42:43.447
What is that, a...

42:43.520 --> 42:45.284
Her death certificate, Boyd.

42:45.360 --> 42:46.691
It says Caroline Dean, Raylan.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.286
Name she was
using at the time.

42:54.640 --> 42:57.644
Her Oklahoma driver's license.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.164
Well, a lot of people
can look like...

43:00.240 --> 43:03.449
We matched the DNA to her hair
from her brush in Harlan.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.086
Well, how did she...

43:09.160 --> 43:10.400
Three years ago.

43:10.800 --> 43:12.609
Car crash in West Texas.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.731
We barely missed her in Tulsa.

43:17.800 --> 43:21.202
She was likely driving
all night, trying to,

43:21.280 --> 43:23.442
you know, put some miles
between us.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.284
Fell asleep at the wheel.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.410
We only found out two weeks ago

43:28.480 --> 43:30.801
when the other
Caroline Dean discovered

43:30.920 --> 43:33.400
someone had used
her name, raised a fuss.

43:36.040 --> 43:39.283
Well, was she alone, Raylan?

43:40.040 --> 43:41.371
As far as I know.

43:43.680 --> 43:45.045
Well...

43:48.680 --> 43:50.011
Okay, then.

43:52.040 --> 43:53.530
Maybe it's for the best.

43:56.320 --> 43:57.446
For who?

43:58.160 --> 44:00.481
Well, she was trying to get out.

44:02.040 --> 44:04.042
But I just don't think
that's possible.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.365
Follows you behind
somehow, Raylan.

44:08.400 --> 44:11.483
Hell, sometimes I think
the only way

44:11.560 --> 44:13.050
to get out of our town alive

44:13.120 --> 44:14.406
is to have never been
born there.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.561
But then, of course,
there's you.

44:21.600 --> 44:23.602
How's life in Florida?

44:23.720 --> 44:25.529
Pretty much as advertised.

44:26.320 --> 44:28.607
You wouldn't like it, though.
Lot of Jews.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.531
Raylan Givens,
if I didn't know better,

44:30.600 --> 44:32.250
I'd think you're trying
to provoke me.

44:32.320 --> 44:33.845
Now, you know Jesus Christ
was a Jew.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.251
I've heard.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.525
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to...

44:41.600 --> 44:43.807
Look for a reason
to get off the phone?

44:47.840 --> 44:51.242
Can I ask you one question
before you go?

44:53.800 --> 44:56.690
As long as you understand
if it annoys me,

44:56.760 --> 44:58.330
I'm just gonna hang up.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.203
Scout's honor.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.848
Tramble Penitentiary

45:04.920 --> 45:07.491
is a long way
from Miami, Raylan.

45:08.200 --> 45:11.124
Now, you could've
called the warden,

45:11.200 --> 45:13.089
could've sent word
through my lawyer...

45:13.160 --> 45:15.288
You asking why I came?

45:17.400 --> 45:18.561
I thought it was news

45:18.640 --> 45:20.483
that should be
delivered in person.

45:22.120 --> 45:23.246
That the only reason?

45:26.480 --> 45:29.484
After all these long years,
Raylan Givens,

45:30.640 --> 45:32.688
that's the only reason?

45:37.000 --> 45:38.729
Well, I suppose
if I allow myself

45:38.840 --> 45:40.080
to be sentimental,

45:40.160 --> 45:42.288
despite all that has occurred,

45:44.480 --> 45:47.165
there is one thing
I wander back to.

45:50.120 --> 45:51.884
We dug coal together.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.166
That's right.
