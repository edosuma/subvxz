21:31.120 --> 21:33.990
<b><i>All these voices
in my brain</i></b>

21:33.990 --> 21:37.580
<b><i>Living through my normal,
oh, so formal</i></b>

21:37.580 --> 21:40.520
<b><i>I swear
they're driving me insane</i></b>

21:40.520 --> 21:44.700
<b><i>Can't tell who's a liar
come hell or high water</i></b>

21:44.700 --> 21:48.600
<b><i>I'm not listening</i></b>

21:48.600 --> 21:50.670
<b><i>Whoa</i></b>

21:51.750 --> 21:54.810
<b><i>I'm getting out of here</i></b>

21:54.810 --> 21:56.500
<b><i>Oh, no</i></b>

21:56.500 --> 21:59.800
<b><i>I won't let go
till you say so</i></b>

21:59.800 --> 22:02.910
<b><i>I'm tired of being lost</i></b>

22:02.910 --> 22:05.790
<b><i>Show me the way
to get back</i></b>

22:05.790 --> 22:09.890
<b><i>Home</i></b>

22:10.930 --> 22:16.370
<b><i>To get back home</i></b>
