01:09.613 --> 01:12.115
So you done heard it now.

01:14.326 --> 01:16.452
So, what do you think?

01:16.453 --> 01:20.206
What I don't see,
I don't see a schedule of events.

01:21.458 --> 01:23.167
It's a little loose.

01:23.168 --> 01:27.171
But see, what we are right now is it
be flexible. You see what I mean?

01:27.172 --> 01:29.548
And it can go down any time
once the old man is gone.

01:29.549 --> 01:33.094
And now that we know that he's going
away and she gonna be there all alone,

01:33.095 --> 01:35.889
that might be too good to wait.

01:37.808 --> 01:40.643
The guy's pulling about 50K
a month out of Detroit.

01:40.644 --> 01:43.646
Not declaring it, not paying
taxes, any of that shit.

01:43.647 --> 01:47.233
Okay, why isn't that enough?
Hold that over his head.

01:47.234 --> 01:49.860
He pays you or you go
to the Federal Building.

01:49.861 --> 01:52.822
Because I know he's doing it,
but I can't prove it.

01:52.823 --> 01:56.200
I tell you, the man ain't dumb. It ain't like
he got his name on no papers or nothing.

01:56.201 --> 01:58.369
We take this man's wife...

01:59.204 --> 02:02.498
Okay, he's so scared
that he gotta pay.

02:02.499 --> 02:04.500
And it ain't like he can
stall us out and tell us,

02:04.501 --> 02:07.003
"It's gonna take me a couple of
weeks to get the money together."

02:07.004 --> 02:10.215
Not if he wanna see his wife again.

02:10.882 --> 02:14.885
Hey, listen, Louis,
you done heard all about it.

02:14.886 --> 02:16.804
You with it or not?

02:50.297 --> 02:52.256
Guy come out behind me?

02:52.257 --> 02:53.758
No.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.969
Wait.

02:56.136 --> 02:58.971
Yeah, you mean this big
dude with the Borsalino?

02:58.972 --> 03:00.264
Um, yeah.

03:00.265 --> 03:03.267
I'm in the can, comes up, says,
"Hey, loan me some money."

03:03.268 --> 03:06.145
I say, "Loan you some money?
You want a buck for a drink, what?"

03:06.146 --> 03:09.565
He pulls a knife, says he wants to
borrow whatever I got in my wallet.

03:09.566 --> 03:11.818
Mother took $27.

03:16.406 --> 03:19.742
Talk some shit to him. Try to get
him out in the middle of the street.

03:19.743 --> 03:21.994
- Nah, I don't think it'd work.
- Try it.

03:21.995 --> 03:25.373
If it don't, then keep running.

03:34.883 --> 03:36.467
Hey, you!

03:36.802 --> 03:40.096
The fuck you want?
You wanna take another $30 leak?

03:40.097 --> 03:41.889
- What?
- How about you quit hiding behind a knife

03:41.890 --> 03:46.144
and a bunch of women, you fat
tub of shit and come out here?

03:46.603 --> 03:49.147
- What the...
- That's right.

03:58.657 --> 04:01.326
Get your ass up. Come on!

04:13.547 --> 04:15.173
Damn!

04:52.002 --> 04:53.794
- Dropped this.
- Yeah.

04:53.795 --> 04:55.713
How much this cost him?

04:55.714 --> 04:57.882
Couple hundred.

04:58.049 --> 05:01.552
I hope he learned something,
but I doubt it.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.195
Eighteenth hole.
The guy's standing over

05:19.196 --> 05:21.197
his tee shot for what
seems like an eternity.

05:21.198 --> 05:24.158
Finally his partner says,
"What is taking you so long?

05:24.159 --> 05:26.076
"Hit the damn ball!"

05:26.077 --> 05:29.246
The guys says, "Well, my wife is up
there watching from the clubhouse,

05:29.247 --> 05:31.415
"and I wanna make
this a perfect shot."

05:31.416 --> 05:33.584
His partner says, "Give me a break!"

05:33.585 --> 05:36.595
"There ain't a snowball's chance in
hell you're gonna hit her from here!"

05:41.843 --> 05:43.344
Hi.

05:43.345 --> 05:44.595
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:44.596 --> 05:46.848
- How you doing, Marshall?
- I'm great.

05:49.935 --> 05:53.604
Mr. and Mrs. Frank Dawson.
Tally-ho, everyone.

05:53.605 --> 05:56.106
What happened, they couldn't
find a bigger trophy?

05:56.107 --> 05:59.235
I'm gonna have to buy a
bigger house to put it in.

05:59.236 --> 06:01.946
- Have you met Mickey, my wife?
- No. Hi, Mickey.

06:01.947 --> 06:03.614
- Ray Shelby.
- Nice to meet you.

06:03.615 --> 06:05.283
She's the other trophy in my life.

06:15.293 --> 06:17.545
- Hello, Mickey.
- Hi.

06:23.426 --> 06:25.094
Frank.

06:25.971 --> 06:27.847
Hey, Frank.

06:28.348 --> 06:31.142
I'll drive. I'd really like to.

06:32.644 --> 06:33.727
You know what's funny?

06:33.728 --> 06:37.481
After 15 years, I still have to explain
to you this is work, winning this thing.

06:37.482 --> 06:39.316
- Frank...
- You make remarks like it's a piece of shit.

06:39.317 --> 06:41.776
I never said that! Frank.
Watch the road!

06:42.404 --> 06:44.822
This here is like the Statue of
Liberty with a golfer on top!

06:44.823 --> 06:46.824
Please watch the road.
I did not say that.

06:49.035 --> 06:51.328
An innocent little voice,
"Cute little Mickey Dawson."

06:51.329 --> 06:54.206
"Oh, my, isn't she precious.
Such a skinny little thing."

06:54.207 --> 06:56.584
"I wonder, how does
she keep her figure?"

06:56.585 --> 06:59.545
What she does is she watches
her husband like a hawk!

06:59.713 --> 07:01.672
- Pecking at him...
- Careful! Stop!

07:01.673 --> 07:03.591
- Counting his drinks.
- Just leave the car out here, please.

07:03.592 --> 07:05.593
Gets so wrapped in it,
she burns calories.

07:05.594 --> 07:07.845
- Okay, slow down! It's fine.
- I got this.

07:08.179 --> 07:10.014
What the hell!

07:10.015 --> 07:12.642
Why did you park in the
middle of the driveway?

07:22.193 --> 07:25.696
I'm never driving
drunk with you again!

07:26.031 --> 07:28.866
And now you're saying I'm drunk!

07:43.548 --> 07:47.343
This here, your Kentucky rifle.

07:47.344 --> 07:50.138
Black powder musket, flintlock.

07:50.847 --> 07:55.101
Winchester Mercury,
12 gauge, double barrel, short.

07:55.268 --> 07:58.604
Blow a hole in you the size
of a basketball close in.

07:59.856 --> 08:04.026
M1 Garand, Army, World War ll.

08:04.235 --> 08:06.904
- That's beautiful.
- German standard issue.

08:07.739 --> 08:10.491
M1 carbine, standard issue.

08:10.492 --> 08:12.910
US Army, World War ll.

08:12.911 --> 08:17.581
Lot of people think this is a Luger.
This is not. It's a Walther P38.

08:17.582 --> 08:20.376
Your dad was in the war, right?

08:20.752 --> 08:24.130
- Yeah, tank gunner.
- Yeah, but...

08:26.049 --> 08:28.342
Which side was he on?

08:28.343 --> 08:32.096
So, Richard, you're telling me all
these herbs come from your own garden?

08:32.097 --> 08:35.808
- Yeah, from the fall. They're dried now.
- Um, really good.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.769
You went and pee in this, did you?
I just fucking with you.

08:38.770 --> 08:41.897
I know you ain't peed.
I could tell if you did, though.

08:41.898 --> 08:43.774
What? What's the matter?

08:44.442 --> 08:46.694
Oh, that. That ain't...

08:46.695 --> 08:50.280
It's actually my favorite. But,
you know, Richard don't think...

08:50.281 --> 08:53.743
Some niggas is all right,
ain't they? Right?

08:54.119 --> 08:55.160
Some.

08:55.161 --> 08:57.996
You like that
Diahann Carroll, don't you?

08:57.997 --> 09:01.792
Don't get cute for company.
You talk about her all the time.

09:01.793 --> 09:05.129
But the rest of them, and I tend
to agree with him on this one,

09:05.130 --> 09:07.131
he said they need
to go back to Africa.

09:07.132 --> 09:10.175
- The ones on welfare.
- Right. Of course the ones on welfare.

09:10.176 --> 09:13.429
You know, they ain't doing shit.
They ain't contributing to society.

09:13.430 --> 09:17.599
He said I could stay, though. At least
until we finish the job, you know.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.560
We should get going.

09:19.561 --> 09:21.145
Yeah, you don't...
You don't want nothing?

09:21.146 --> 09:23.647
- You don't want me to follow her today?
- No.

09:23.648 --> 09:28.194
No, no. No, that's fine. We're good today.
We'll get in touch with you, Richard.

09:28.403 --> 09:29.903
He's incredible. He's amazing.

09:29.904 --> 09:34.324
Listen, all I got to do was tell him,
"Hey, Richard, this a rich, big Jew."

09:34.325 --> 09:36.493
And then it's like,
"This is for the cause."

09:36.494 --> 09:38.871
Then he would do it even if he
didn't need the money so bad.

09:38.872 --> 09:42.499
What's he need money for?
Buy more guns? Hitler's underwear?

09:42.500 --> 09:45.503
No. His old lady left him.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.505
Ran off, took Richard
Junior and everything.

09:48.506 --> 09:49.757
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

09:49.758 --> 09:55.512
Now he think that they in California
'cause he got a postcard from Disneyland.

09:55.513 --> 09:59.267
- Jesus.
- He so dumb, it's adorable.

10:07.358 --> 10:09.276
That's her?

10:09.277 --> 10:11.821
- That's her.
- Hmm.

10:12.197 --> 10:14.949
I was expecting someone older.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.742
Oh, that's her.

10:17.243 --> 10:20.371
That's the one we want.
That's Mickey.

10:20.538 --> 10:22.873
Why'd they have to choose
us for this stupid article?

10:22.874 --> 10:24.750
Because you won that day.

10:24.751 --> 10:26.877
It's mostly about you.

10:26.878 --> 10:29.505
"Children's games
become their career."

10:29.506 --> 10:34.927
"Proud mother Margaret 'Mickey' Dawson
watches her son Bo smash a volley."

10:35.094 --> 10:37.638
Bo, why don't we focus
on today's game?

10:38.473 --> 10:40.057
You didn't wake me up.

10:40.183 --> 10:42.226
I didn't know you were playing today.
You didn't say anything.

10:42.227 --> 10:44.895
- I never play tennis on Sundays, huh?
- Well...

10:44.896 --> 10:46.605
- Why would I play tennis on Sundays?
- I'm just...

10:46.606 --> 10:49.566
Hey, Bo, what do I do every Sunday?

10:49.567 --> 10:51.777
- Tennis.
- Play tennis.

10:51.778 --> 10:53.404
Okay.

10:53.905 --> 10:57.282
Why do I have to wake up
to that neighbor's dog?

10:57.283 --> 11:00.410
How many times have we told him?
"Keep it locked up."

11:00.411 --> 11:02.579
Hey, Frank, your name's in the paper.

11:02.580 --> 11:04.540
For the Club Championship?

11:04.541 --> 11:07.209
No, it's actually about the kids.
You know, the kids playing tennis?

11:07.210 --> 11:10.003
Oh, oh, look at that!
It's the two of you there.

11:10.004 --> 11:13.007
- Yeah.
- That's a nice picture of Bo.

11:14.717 --> 11:16.635
You look stressed, honey.

11:18.596 --> 11:21.849
Listen, since I'm, uh, going down
to Freeport the end of the week...

11:23.017 --> 11:25.269
I told you about that, right?

11:25.270 --> 11:28.272
- I don't know. You might have.
- Yeah, I'm sure I did.

11:28.273 --> 11:30.607
Group of investors coming
all the way from Japan.

11:30.608 --> 11:32.193
Can you believe it?

11:32.443 --> 11:36.572
So, I figured, why not
fly down to South Beach.

11:37.574 --> 11:39.491
Tonight.

11:39.492 --> 11:42.077
With Bo? See your folks.

11:42.078 --> 11:44.913
Get him settled, then I'll hop
on the shuttle to Freeport.

11:44.914 --> 11:48.042
What do you think, Bo?
Sound like fun?

11:50.587 --> 11:53.255
I just don't see why all
of a sudden he has to go.

11:53.256 --> 11:56.466
How many times? You don't say "he."

11:56.467 --> 11:59.261
- You know who I mean.
- That's not the point, all right?

11:59.262 --> 12:02.973
He, your father, will be in Freeport,
and he thought it would be nice

12:02.974 --> 12:07.395
for you guys to fly down together
and spend some quality time.

12:07.645 --> 12:11.899
He'll probably check out the camp.
You know, he loves watching you. So...

12:11.900 --> 12:14.819
He loves to tell me what to do.
He doesn't know shit.

12:16.988 --> 12:18.989
Well, does he?

12:23.995 --> 12:27.372
Hello. This is the residence
of Ordell Robbie.

12:27.373 --> 12:29.166
- What you got?
- Okay.

12:29.167 --> 12:31.793
So, the builder man
you sent us out to?

12:31.794 --> 12:34.880
- Yeah. Shelby.
- Hmm, that's right, Mr. Ray Shelby.

12:34.881 --> 12:38.342
He told me Frank gonna be gone
all this week starting tomorrow.

12:38.343 --> 12:40.761
- Tomorrow? That fast?
- I asked him something like,

12:40.762 --> 12:43.555
"Hey, let's make it a party.
Why don't you bring your friend Frank?"

12:43.556 --> 12:47.601
He told me, "Frank? Frank's leaving
town tomorrow with his son."

12:47.602 --> 12:49.353
- "We got a party right here, don't we?"
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:49.354 --> 12:52.690
You saying that Frank is
leaving town with his son?

13:02.533 --> 13:04.451
Listen, Bo.

13:04.452 --> 13:05.953
What?

13:05.954 --> 13:08.205
When you get back...

13:08.998 --> 13:12.584
Not now, 'cause we don't have
enough time, but... Um...

13:12.585 --> 13:14.378
For what?

13:15.546 --> 13:17.381
A talk.

13:19.342 --> 13:24.513
You know, cut all the baloney
and just tell each other

13:25.890 --> 13:28.142
how we really feel.

13:28.977 --> 13:30.478
Hmm?

13:32.230 --> 13:33.856
Okay.

13:51.082 --> 13:53.625
What are you thinking about?

13:53.626 --> 13:55.544
How are you?

13:56.587 --> 13:58.880
I'm fine. How are you?

13:58.881 --> 14:01.758
You know, I seem to recall saying
something to you last night.

14:01.759 --> 14:03.761
You remember?

14:04.095 --> 14:05.554
What?

14:05.555 --> 14:08.682
I asked if you'd have lunch with me.

14:08.683 --> 14:12.019
Marshall, you were drunk.
We all were.

14:12.020 --> 14:15.356
- You say things...
- Mmm-hmm, and what if I meant it?

14:16.441 --> 14:19.860
- isn't Tyra waiting for you somewhere?
- If she asks,

14:19.861 --> 14:21.945
we're just talking about
the piece in the paper.

14:21.946 --> 14:23.280
Haven't read it yet.

14:23.281 --> 14:24.364
Don't.

14:24.365 --> 14:27.784
What I'm gonna do is cut out the
picture and keep it in my wallet.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.954
Marshall, come on!

14:31.247 --> 14:32.956
There's nothing too bad about lunch.

14:32.957 --> 14:35.876
- What is the point?
- I'd like to talk to you.

14:35.877 --> 14:38.045
We're talking right now.

14:38.046 --> 14:40.130
Do you remember any of
the things I said last night?

14:40.131 --> 14:41.214
Marshall.

14:41.215 --> 14:43.300
- How I've been thinking about you?
- Okay, I gotta go.

14:43.301 --> 14:45.552
Bo's match is in a moment,
so I'm late for that.

14:45.553 --> 14:48.389
I hear Frank's off to the Bahamas.

14:48.473 --> 14:50.807
Just for a few days.

14:50.808 --> 14:52.392
I asked him if he wanted
to play next Saturday

14:52.393 --> 14:54.228
and he said he'd be
gone the whole week.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.525
When...

15:00.526 --> 15:02.194
Lunch tomorrow? Scalintella, 1:00?

15:02.195 --> 15:04.363
No, when did he...

15:04.947 --> 15:06.782
- This is really not a good idea.
- You're right.

15:06.783 --> 15:08.492
- Okay?
- You're right.

15:08.493 --> 15:10.202
- I'll just come over.
- Oh, there's Frank.

15:10.203 --> 15:11.536
Hi.

15:11.537 --> 15:12.996
Okay. Frank is coming,
so let’s just...

15:12.997 --> 15:14.414
Okay, I'll see you.

15:14.415 --> 15:17.501
Hey, you keep your wife out here,
someone's liable to steal her.

15:17.502 --> 15:20.254
You promise? See you inside.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.172
You bet.

15:23.174 --> 15:25.843
You sent a waitress
back to come get me?

15:26.594 --> 15:29.346
I asked her if she'd seen you.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.309
Having lunch with us today, sir?

15:34.310 --> 15:36.687
Tennis. Maybe tomorrow.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.465
Out!

16:22.316 --> 16:25.235
Okay, we send the
guy a note, we call him?

16:25.236 --> 16:28.530
No, we call him. We call him.

16:29.699 --> 16:30.782
Game, Mithen.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.868
She never sees
us or knows who we are.

16:32.869 --> 16:35.078
No. No.

16:35.079 --> 16:39.249
We got masks. She got a mask
with tape covering the eye hole.

16:39.917 --> 16:42.043
And how do you know
the money's still in Freeport?

16:42.044 --> 16:44.546
That's where my partner,
Mr. Walker, comes in, see.

16:44.547 --> 16:48.217
He is connected to
one Lisabeth Cooper,

16:48.259 --> 16:52.762
who happens to be the manager of
the Providence Saving & Trust Bank,

16:52.763 --> 16:54.973
where Frank keeps his money.

16:54.974 --> 16:57.976
And she also happens to have the second
biggest set of titties on the island.

16:57.977 --> 16:59.519
Who has the biggest set?

16:59.520 --> 17:02.481
Grace Brown. Older woman.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.273
Good friend of Mr. Walker, too.

17:04.275 --> 17:06.443
Let's say he don't see any choice.

17:06.444 --> 17:10.280
He's scared enough, doesn't call the cops
and he goes through with it, he pays up.

17:10.281 --> 17:11.448
That's how it's supposed to work.

17:11.449 --> 17:17.496
And then we take that check and we deposit
it in another numbered account in Nassau.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.580
So you're thinking tonight?

17:19.582 --> 17:21.290
No.

17:21.291 --> 17:24.795
No, I gotta call Mr. Walker,
make sure everything's straight.

17:31.469 --> 17:34.304
I don't see nothing
wrong with tomorrow.

17:47.026 --> 17:48.443
Excuse me.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.487
I'm so sorry. Thank you.

17:52.031 --> 17:53.949
Mrs. Dawson?

17:54.158 --> 17:55.701
Yes?

17:57.411 --> 17:58.662
I think this is your son's racket.

17:58.663 --> 18:01.874
I found it there. I was gonna
hand it in at the desk.

18:03.042 --> 18:05.169
Oh, it is. Thanks.

18:06.837 --> 18:08.630
That's okay.

18:08.631 --> 18:10.174
Okay.

19:11.610 --> 19:15.322
No. They got in so late
last night. I was really so tired.

19:15.323 --> 19:16.406
I'm so sorry, Mom.

19:16.407 --> 19:19.284
Frank had a meeting at the
club and he missed his flight.

19:19.285 --> 19:22.495
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just come down with Bo?

19:22.496 --> 19:25.915
Tidying up and doing the house.
It's nice to have a little break actually.

19:25.916 --> 19:28.835
And Bo's so thin.
Doesn't he eat anything?

19:28.836 --> 19:32.673
He's eating. You know,
he's been playing a lot of tennis.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.860
He's all set up in the guest room.

19:53.861 --> 19:55.278
How is Bo?

19:55.279 --> 19:58.907
Oh, he's fine. He said something
happened with your car.

19:58.908 --> 20:03.745
Oh, nothing. Just, somebody crashed into it,
but no one was in the car, so it's all good.

20:26.769 --> 20:29.938
So, were Dad and
Frank up all night talking?

20:29.939 --> 20:31.606
Frank? No. He's not here.

20:31.607 --> 20:35.276
We offered to drive him to the airport
in the morning, but he didn't want to.

20:35.277 --> 20:37.404
He said it was too much trouble.

20:37.405 --> 20:40.156
He was on the 7:00
shuttle to Freeport.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.659
He said we'd just get home
and have to drive him back.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.993
So why bother?

20:43.994 --> 20:46.079
Yeah, well,
you know Frank. He doesn't...

20:46.080 --> 20:48.248
Everything's fine.

20:48.624 --> 20:50.208
Okay.

20:50.584 --> 20:54.003
I don't understand.
Why didn't you just come down with Bo?

20:54.004 --> 20:56.923
Why don't you ever call?
I've always wondered.

20:56.924 --> 20:59.592
- I have so much to do here.
- You never call Dad.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.221
Okay, I'm putting away some
groceries, so I'm gonna go.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.682
I love you. Give my love to Bo.

21:05.683 --> 21:07.392
I will, dear. I'll talk to you later.

21:07.393 --> 21:08.977
- Okay.
- Bye.

21:27.455 --> 21:29.205
It's okay.

21:29.206 --> 21:31.375
You're all right.

21:32.042 --> 21:33.168
- What happened?
- Let's go.

21:33.169 --> 21:35.378
Aw, shit, she don't have
any shoes on. She's bleeding.

21:35.379 --> 21:39.716
She don't need no shoes.
Let's go. All right. Come on.

21:40.384 --> 21:42.635
If you want money,
my purse is on the table. I have...

21:45.890 --> 21:47.223
Get down.

21:53.898 --> 21:58.067
- Are you expecting somebody?
- My husband is coming home. He's...

21:58.068 --> 21:59.569
No. Ain't your husband.

22:03.073 --> 22:05.534
- Come on, get up. Get up.
- Ah!

22:10.080 --> 22:12.582
Come on. Go upstairs. Let's go.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.418
Ouch.

22:19.173 --> 22:21.591
Last step. Here you go.

22:22.593 --> 22:24.261
Keep moving. Keep your mouth shut.

22:36.106 --> 22:38.233
- It's all right. Go.
- Ah.

22:38.234 --> 22:40.360
Turn around. Sit.

22:48.536 --> 22:50.203
Frank?

22:55.125 --> 22:56.793
Frank?

22:58.379 --> 23:00.505
You on your trip?

23:29.493 --> 23:31.119
Fuck.

24:02.192 --> 24:03.819
Shit.

24:07.031 --> 24:08.156
Ouch.

24:08.157 --> 24:09.699
Oh, God.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.326
Hold still.

24:11.327 --> 24:13.662
Ah! Ow!

24:14.496 --> 24:16.039
Got it.

24:39.605 --> 24:42.691
Shh! Not a peep.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.124
Did somebody say they
wanted an ice-cold martini?

25:00.125 --> 25:02.251
- What the heck?
- Marshall?

25:05.589 --> 25:08.758
Oh! Shit.

25:10.469 --> 25:12.971
- It's just him?
- Just him.

25:16.850 --> 25:20.019
- Who the fuck is this?
- Marshall.

25:20.020 --> 25:21.729
Who the fuck is that?

25:21.730 --> 25:24.148
Listen. He's gonna
wake up at some point.

25:24.149 --> 25:26.401
ORDELL I know that.

25:26.402 --> 25:30.113
So we call the husband,
tell him not to call the cops.

25:30.114 --> 25:32.323
It doesn't matter,
this guy's already been here.

25:32.324 --> 25:34.075
Correct.

25:34.326 --> 25:38.288
Dawson comes home, finds him,
he's gotta call the cops.

25:38.914 --> 25:42.626
So, what are you saying?
We just quit? Just leave?

25:48.757 --> 25:50.049
No.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.554
We're this far.

25:55.389 --> 25:57.307
We take her.

26:25.419 --> 26:27.378
- There, step up. Step up!
- Ah.

26:27.379 --> 26:29.172
Up. There you go.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.217
There you go. Step.

26:37.347 --> 26:40.976
Almost there. Keep going. Three more.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.728
- Go on.
- Oh, God.

26:49.777 --> 26:51.903
Turn around. Sit.

26:52.571 --> 26:55.865
When you hear the door close,
you can take the mask off.

26:55.866 --> 26:59.202
I'll come up later and
bandage your foot.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.915
- Excuse me.
- No talking.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.041
Need to use the bathroom,

27:05.042 --> 27:08.420
knock on the door and
put your mask back on.

28:26.456 --> 28:28.166
Mickey?

29:10.709 --> 29:14.170
- Giancarlo Giannini?
- Uh.

29:14.171 --> 29:15.722
Opera singer.

29:15.723 --> 29:18.716
- Frank, incorrect.
- I don't know.

29:18.717 --> 29:20.384
Niki Lauda?

29:20.385 --> 29:22.552
- I don't know who that is.
- You get a grape.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.513
Betty Bacall, or Lauren Bacall?

29:24.514 --> 29:26.682
I know her. Yeah, she's an actress.

29:26.683 --> 29:28.392
- Oh.
- All right. You get a grape.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.019
Yves Saint Laurent?

29:30.020 --> 29:33.314
- Yeah, he makes women's clothes.
- Very impressive.

29:33.315 --> 29:36.985
- Alain Delon?
- Alain Delon.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.528
- Uh.
- No?

29:39.529 --> 29:42.281
- Georgia O'Keeffe?
- She's a stripper.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.827
Please, Frank! I'm giving
you the easy ones.

29:46.828 --> 29:49.164
These are people with style,
like you, baby.

29:49.539 --> 29:52.750
Jack Nicholson you know.
Anyone with a brain cell knows him.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.920
- Lelous Delafilace.
- For Christ's sake.

29:56.213 --> 29:58.089
Jean Renoir?

29:58.090 --> 30:01.134
- I don't wanna play anymore.
- Meanie.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.928
Okay. What do you wanna do?

30:03.929 --> 30:05.346
You wanna fuck?

30:05.347 --> 30:07.723
The mouth on you!

30:07.724 --> 30:09.934
Since we're going to bed, yeah.

30:09.935 --> 30:13.855
- You wanna do the Florentine thing again?
- Which one is that?

30:27.911 --> 30:31.205
News 4 Detroit, with John
Blunt and Jennifer Moore.

30:31.206 --> 30:35.335
Don Shane with sports, and Larry
Shannon with the weather.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.755
Good evening. Americans are
beginning to understand...

30:39.756 --> 30:41.298
I'll leave you a couple of smokes.

30:41.299 --> 30:44.260
...we are disliked by
much of the Muslim world.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.596
Thank you.

30:46.847 --> 30:49.098
- Phones have been ringing off the hook...
- Why is it so loud?

30:49.099 --> 30:50.474
...all night tonight
here in our newsroom.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.102
- People asking about a recall...
- Yoo-hoo, Marsh?

30:53.103 --> 30:55.104
You call Mickey to see
when Frank will be back?

30:55.105 --> 30:57.732
I told you no one answered.

30:57.733 --> 31:01.402
So, this is the Lucy Anne.
Which one do you like?

31:01.486 --> 31:04.447
- That one.
- I thought you liked the green.

31:05.449 --> 31:08.784
- Can I please go to the mall?
- The mall? It's 8:30 at night.

31:08.785 --> 31:10.745
- No. Nothing's open.
- How many rings?

31:10.746 --> 31:11.871
- What?
- What?

31:11.872 --> 31:14.790
How many rings did you
give it when you called?

31:14.791 --> 31:17.001
Oh, my God, what is
the matter with you?

31:17.002 --> 31:20.880
Did that car accident turn my
husband into a crazy person?

31:20.964 --> 31:22.631
So this is the same
girl you're talking about?

31:22.632 --> 31:23.799
See her every day.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.802
- She's not an island girl?
- American girl.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.846
Long hair, very good-looking.

31:28.847 --> 31:30.639
No, I hear you.
I hear you, bro. I hear you.

31:30.640 --> 31:33.350
Sexy. I think she's
connected to the guy.

31:33.351 --> 31:36.103
There are 14 hospitals
in the Detroit area

31:36.104 --> 31:38.481
which are prime candidates
on the commission's list.

31:38.482 --> 31:41.942
Most of the hospitals on the
list are smaller hospitals,

31:41.943 --> 31:44.153
among them Dearborn Medical Center.

31:44.154 --> 31:47.281
Center Administrator William Harris
claims having fewer hospitals...

31:47.282 --> 31:49.450
You done playing doctor?

31:49.451 --> 31:52.745
You gonna tell me or
keep it to yourself?

31:53.246 --> 31:57.500
So Walker said he's staying at
his place by the golf course.

31:57.918 --> 32:01.588
- What else?
- And he's got a lady with him.

32:16.686 --> 32:18.521
You said you seen
him with women before.

32:18.522 --> 32:20.523
See, I knew he liked the ladies,

32:20.524 --> 32:24.443
but I didn't know he was going down
there to see the same lady every time.

32:24.444 --> 32:28.030
I'm thinking he got, you know, couple of
friends, couple of birds around town,

32:28.031 --> 32:29.657
but no.

32:29.741 --> 32:33.202
No. Walker says the
same one all the time.

32:34.037 --> 32:35.788
Melanie.

32:36.206 --> 32:38.541
I don't see the problem.
So he's got something on the side.

32:38.542 --> 32:40.376
I didn't say it was a problem.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.336
I just like to know this man's shit.

32:42.337 --> 32:45.548
Like, you know, what he up to,
what he doing down there. Like...

32:45.549 --> 32:47.759
Who's this Melanie?

32:48.385 --> 32:50.887
So let's call and ask him.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.057
Not yet.

33:01.148 --> 33:02.899
I filed.

33:05.735 --> 33:09.322
You have? Why didn't you tell me?

33:09.364 --> 33:10.823
Talked to the lawyer on Friday.

33:10.824 --> 33:14.410
He said the papers would be
delivered to the house on Tuesday.

33:14.536 --> 33:17.079
So you came down here early.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.166
Give her some time to think about it.

33:21.585 --> 33:23.919
And what's she gonna do?

33:23.920 --> 33:25.379
Oh, she'll probably go along with it.

33:25.380 --> 33:29.383
She'll say things to her friends,
suck around for sympathy.

33:29.384 --> 33:31.636
"Poor little thing."

33:32.220 --> 33:33.888
"The prick."

33:34.639 --> 33:37.141
What's she like?
What's she interested in?

33:37.142 --> 33:39.768
- Do you mind me asking?
- No, I don't mind.

33:39.769 --> 33:43.189
Uh, my drinking,
that's a popular subject.

33:44.482 --> 33:47.359
"How many drinks
have you had, Frank?"

33:47.360 --> 33:50.988
Or, "Where's Bo? It's late.
He's not home yet."

33:52.449 --> 33:56.493
Bo, that's something I'm gonna have
to deal with in the settlement.

33:56.494 --> 33:59.413
She is his mother.
I'm not gonna argue that.

33:59.414 --> 34:03.459
But it's all right.
He and I'll see each other.

34:03.877 --> 34:05.961
I'd like to meet your son.

34:05.962 --> 34:07.171
Well, someday you will,

34:07.172 --> 34:10.216
if you don't take that big canvas bag
of yours and take off somewhere.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.635
- I'm not gonna take off.
- Hmm.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.697
- Yeah?
- I wanna go to the bathroom.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.324
You got the mask?

34:35.492 --> 34:38.661
Oh, yeah. Hold on.

34:41.748 --> 34:44.750
You think that dude
is still in the closet?

34:44.751 --> 34:46.668
You hit him.

34:48.505 --> 34:51.297
I didn't hit him that hard.

34:51.299 --> 34:53.551
You hope you didn't.

35:02.060 --> 35:03.185
Oh.

35:03.186 --> 35:04.771
Okay.

35:15.156 --> 35:17.617
- All right.
- Oh, God.

35:17.993 --> 35:22.162
Okay. Now, when you get in
here and the door's closing,

35:22.163 --> 35:25.708
you can take off the mask
and do your business.

35:26.751 --> 35:28.711
There you go.

35:49.733 --> 35:51.275
What in the hell are you doing?

35:56.072 --> 35:59.283
- Jesus Christ.
- It's my house, ain't it?

36:00.076 --> 36:03.496
- What's the matter with you?
- Don't like it?

36:03.913 --> 36:06.248
You two can go
somewhere else for all I care.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.752
Let's hurry up in there. You done?

36:09.753 --> 36:12.588
No, not yet. My mask is off.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.933
Hey, Richard. Come here, man.

36:24.851 --> 36:26.810
We gonna need you to
get back in the uniform

36:26.811 --> 36:30.939
and get back out in the field and
do some reconnaissance work.

36:30.940 --> 36:35.527
Go to the lady's house,
gain access to the premises.

36:35.528 --> 36:40.199
Just go to Dawson's house and make
sure the guy Marshall's not dead.

36:41.743 --> 36:43.578
Basically.

36:43.620 --> 36:44.912
Okay.

36:44.913 --> 36:47.373
He was upstairs, in the closet.

37:24.828 --> 37:27.413
- Oh, this is unbelievable.
- Yeah, I know.

37:27.414 --> 37:29.790
It's a little strange.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.627
You watch the news?

37:34.628 --> 37:36.255
Yes.

37:36.256 --> 37:40.092
There's nothing about you on
the 7:30 or the 8:00. Why you think?

37:40.093 --> 37:41.844
What are you asking me for?

37:41.845 --> 37:44.972
You got something
going with that guy?

37:46.766 --> 37:48.392
He's a friend of the family.

37:48.393 --> 37:49.977
Well, he must be the godfather,

37:49.978 --> 37:53.147
bringing you martinis to your
bedroom while your husband's away.

37:53.148 --> 37:55.441
How come he didn't call the police?

37:55.442 --> 37:59.153
I don't know! He could
be dead or in a coma.

37:59.154 --> 38:01.572
You hit him with something, right?

38:04.325 --> 38:06.202
We checked.

38:07.120 --> 38:08.913
He let himself out.

38:09.956 --> 38:13.167
So now,
we waiting on the 11:00 news.

38:14.043 --> 38:16.087
What we mean is

38:17.005 --> 38:19.256
we don't know Marshall,

38:19.799 --> 38:21.383
or what he's got to lose,

38:21.384 --> 38:25.846
but is he the kind of guy who'd
stick his neck out for you?

38:32.395 --> 38:35.940
Honestly, guys, I don't know.

38:36.274 --> 38:38.234
I don't know.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.866
- Are you gonna get that?
- I don't know.

38:45.867 --> 38:49.954
- Did you want me to get it?
- No, I got it. I'll get it.

38:50.205 --> 38:53.624
You stay in bed. Go back to sleep.

39:03.718 --> 39:04.927
Yeah.

39:04.928 --> 39:06.261
Good evening, Frank.

39:06.262 --> 39:08.847
Hope I'm not disturbing
your lovely evening.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.098
Who is this?

39:10.099 --> 39:12.601
Hold the line. Your wife would
like to speak with you.

39:12.602 --> 39:14.311
My wife?

39:15.271 --> 39:17.814
No, he's got it. Go ahead.

39:17.815 --> 39:19.608
Frank? Frank.

39:19.609 --> 39:21.902
- Who was that?
- I don't know!

39:21.903 --> 39:24.029
- Where are you?
- I don't know, Frank.

39:24.030 --> 39:26.281
- Is this some kind of joke?
- No. They want you...

39:26.282 --> 39:27.950
Are you all right?

39:27.951 --> 39:30.035
- No, I'm...
- Who was I just talking to?

39:30.036 --> 39:32.162
Shh! Frank, stop. Would you
just please listen to me?

39:32.163 --> 39:33.247
Are you all right?

39:33.248 --> 39:35.332
They want you to hear my
voice, that's all that I know.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.919
- Who's they? What's going on?
- Good.

39:39.337 --> 39:42.298
You're okay. You're okay.
You did good.

39:42.423 --> 39:46.761
Hello? Hello? What... Hello?

39:47.971 --> 39:50.306
Who the fuck is this?

39:51.057 --> 39:52.891
Hello? Mickey?

39:52.892 --> 39:56.270
- Mr. Dawson, how you doing?
- What the fuck is going on?

39:56.271 --> 39:59.523
And how's Melanie?
We understand she's got a great bod.

39:59.524 --> 40:02.651
- Who the fuck is this?
- Who am I?

40:02.652 --> 40:05.279
Well, I'm not allowed to
tell you that, Mr. Dawson.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.156
But I can tell you this.

40:07.407 --> 40:10.993
Tomorrow morning, you're gonna
go to the Providence Bank & Trust

40:10.994 --> 40:13.954
and draw $1 million
out of your account.

40:13.955 --> 40:17.917
You know what I can tell you?
You're out of your fucking mind.

40:18.585 --> 40:23.088
Dawson, I think you better quit talking and
listen 'cause you're in deep shit, man.

40:23.089 --> 40:24.214
Are you listening?

40:24.215 --> 40:26.174
You draw the one million
in a cashier's check

40:26.175 --> 40:27.384
and deposit it at the same bank...

40:27.385 --> 40:30.137
- Are you kidding me?
- Are you listening?

40:30.138 --> 40:34.266
To account number 8950039.

40:37.353 --> 40:40.523
Hello? You write it down?

40:41.107 --> 40:42.691
No. I don't have a pen.

40:42.692 --> 40:44.234
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Jesus Christ!

40:44.235 --> 40:46.403
- Get a fucking pen, Frank!
- Put my wife back on the goddamn phone.

40:46.404 --> 40:49.114
- How hard can it be? Shut up!
- Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?

40:49.115 --> 40:50.532
- Shut up and listen!
- I'm gonna call the cops!

40:50.533 --> 40:54.328
If you go to the police, listen to me,
you will never see your wife again!

40:54.329 --> 40:56.997
You do anything but put the
money in that account,

40:56.998 --> 40:59.166
you'll never see her alive again!

40:59.167 --> 41:02.127
She's gone! Plus,
we know about the money!

41:02.128 --> 41:05.714
We know about Dynamic, Ray Shelby,
the whores on Webster Avenue! Everything!

41:05.715 --> 41:06.882
I need a pen.

41:06.883 --> 41:08.717
We know about Melanie.
We know everything you do!

41:08.718 --> 41:10.594
Don't fuck with us! Write it down!

41:10.595 --> 41:11.887
Who is it?

41:11.888 --> 41:15.724
- 89500...
- Slow down! What am I, a stenographer?

41:15.725 --> 41:19.478
8950039!

41:22.899 --> 41:24.733
Repeat it back to me!

41:24.734 --> 41:27.653
- 8950039.
- Correct.

41:33.076 --> 41:35.744
- How did it sound?
- Shit!

41:35.953 --> 41:37.663
Shit, yeah!

41:37.914 --> 41:39.456
Who was that?

41:40.708 --> 41:42.251
I don't know.

42:01.354 --> 42:03.522
Only thing that...

42:04.774 --> 42:06.274
What?

42:06.275 --> 42:10.529
What's he tell this Melanie?
How tight you think he is with her?

42:10.530 --> 42:15.284
She ain't nothing but some ass.
Just some ass. Don't worry about that.

43:08.504 --> 43:12.007
You fucking bitch!
I'm gonna kill you!

43:12.008 --> 43:13.341
What's going on up there?

43:16.596 --> 43:17.888
Hey, hey, hey!

43:17.889 --> 43:19.932
- Richard!
- Fuck!

43:20.308 --> 43:22.017
Richard!

43:23.936 --> 43:26.855
- The fuck are you doing!
- Put my eye out with a cigarette.

43:26.856 --> 43:28.690
- Shit. How'd she...
- You peep through the walls.

43:28.691 --> 43:32.277
What did you expect? He thinks
he's in the fucking Gestapo.

43:32.278 --> 43:34.404
- Who gave her those cigarettes?
- I did.

43:34.405 --> 43:35.989
Just relax. Let me take a look.

43:35.990 --> 43:37.657
I'm blind! I can't see!

43:37.658 --> 43:40.327
- No, you're good.
- Blind? You got the other eye.

43:40.328 --> 43:42.496
Shut up! Shut up.

43:42.497 --> 43:44.706
I'm cool. I'm cool.

43:44.707 --> 43:47.167
- I'll take a look at it.
- Oh, shut up!

43:47.168 --> 43:49.711
Get you some ice. Just cool out.

43:49.712 --> 43:50.837
Whoa.

43:50.838 --> 43:52.756
Mickey, you okay?

43:52.757 --> 43:54.341
Uh-huh.

43:55.551 --> 43:57.261
Shut up.

44:01.057 --> 44:03.225
So, Richard, I got a joke for you.
You might like this one.

44:03.226 --> 44:05.227
You too, Louis.

44:05.228 --> 44:07.604
Dude goes to the doctor, right?

44:07.605 --> 44:11.567
Doctor says, "Sir, you have
to stop masturbating."

44:12.068 --> 44:15.070
Patient goes, "Why?" Doctor goes,

44:15.112 --> 44:18.157
"Because I'm trying to examine you."

44:21.244 --> 44:23.704
Oh, what's the matter?
What, that too close to home?

44:23.788 --> 44:25.997
All right, how about this one?

44:25.998 --> 44:30.335
A nigger, a Jew and a Nazi
get in a Volkswagen...

44:41.722 --> 44:43.139
I got some food for you.

44:43.140 --> 44:45.934
I got chicken and noodles
cooked in chicken soup

44:45.935 --> 44:48.061
with onions and some other things.
Looks pretty good.

44:48.062 --> 44:50.939
- You got your mask on? Can't tell.
- Yes.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.232
Yes.

44:52.233 --> 44:53.776
Okay.

44:55.945 --> 44:59.156
You can turn around.
It doesn't matter.

45:02.285 --> 45:04.620
Oh, come on!

45:04.662 --> 45:06.789
No! Take it off!

45:07.707 --> 45:09.082
Don't look.

45:09.083 --> 45:10.750
I used that tape to cover
up the hole in the wall.

45:10.751 --> 45:12.752
You guys are gonna have to get
your kicks another way, okay.

45:12.753 --> 45:14.963
You don't have to worry about that.
We'll cover the holes.

45:14.964 --> 45:17.132
What is wrong with that guy?

45:17.133 --> 45:19.760
He's disgusting. He stinks.

45:20.136 --> 45:24.347
Yeah. Well, he's got a few
problems, but who hasn't, right?

45:24.348 --> 45:26.183
Shit.

45:27.977 --> 45:30.645
What are you gonna do to me?

45:30.646 --> 45:33.857
Your son, he didn't
go with him, did he?

45:35.026 --> 45:37.778
- No, he went to Florida.
- Yeah.

45:39.447 --> 45:43.367
You know your husband has
a girl with him down there.

45:46.412 --> 45:49.498
- No.
- You never suspected it?

45:55.338 --> 45:58.298
- No.
- You guys get along all right?

45:59.300 --> 46:00.842
- Why?
- I'm just asking.

46:00.843 --> 46:03.637
Most men, they go away,
they pick up something.

46:03.638 --> 46:05.764
It isn't unusual.

46:10.394 --> 46:12.688
How do you know that?

46:13.439 --> 46:14.731
I can't tell you.

46:14.732 --> 46:18.610
You know about his personal
bank account in Freeport?

46:18.986 --> 46:20.529
Hey.

46:21.113 --> 46:23.073
Face forward.

46:24.241 --> 46:26.660
I know he does business down there.
I would assume that...

46:26.661 --> 46:29.204
With over a million in it?

46:30.206 --> 46:33.041
- How do you know that?
- We know.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.044
- Maybe that's...
- It's 50 grand a month

46:36.045 --> 46:40.799
he's been taking out of his apartments
in Detroit and putting it away.

46:47.306 --> 46:49.892
So the building cost me 100 grand.

46:50.059 --> 46:53.561
I put about 40 grand worth of
materials and appliances in it

46:53.562 --> 46:55.897
and have it reappraised
for 200 grand.

46:55.898 --> 46:59.734
- Wow.
- Okay. Now, I've only put 10% down, right?

46:59.735 --> 47:03.905
And the 40 grand of materials actually only
really cost me about four or five grand.

47:03.906 --> 47:06.741
But I'm writing off
depreciation on...

47:06.742 --> 47:09.203
- Two hundred grand.
- Right.

47:09.245 --> 47:12.747
And on the rentals, I only
declare 60% occupancy.

47:12.748 --> 47:15.250
- And that's all paid in cash.
- Jeez.

47:15.251 --> 47:17.752
You're a genius, baby.

47:17.753 --> 47:22.925
Somehow, though, these guys that
called, they know about this.

47:26.595 --> 47:30.098
What's fucked up here,
besides the obvious,

47:30.516 --> 47:33.893
is here you are filing for divorce,
and then this happens.

47:33.894 --> 47:35.186
Not wanting to be married,

47:35.187 --> 47:38.273
but, I mean, gosh, don't want anything
awful to happen to her, either.

47:38.274 --> 47:40.442
Yeah. Yeah, right.

47:40.443 --> 47:44.362
I mean, you may pay the million
bucks, and they still might...

47:44.363 --> 47:48.116
I mean, let me rephrase that.
You still might not see her again, honey.

47:48.117 --> 47:50.285
Or if I couldn't get to
the bank for some reason

47:50.286 --> 47:52.620
and didn't make the payment
on time, then what?

47:52.621 --> 47:55.582
Do you know what? We don't
even know if she's alive or dead.

47:55.583 --> 47:57.459
We know she's alive.
I talked to her on the phone.

47:57.460 --> 48:01.046
- But was that really her?
- That was her. It was definitely her.

48:01.047 --> 48:03.507
Gosh, I don't know.

48:04.550 --> 48:08.136
I mean, we could call their
bluff and see what happens.

48:08.137 --> 48:11.431
- No, I can't do that.
- No, we can't do that.

48:11.432 --> 48:13.809
- It's too risky.
- Yeah.

48:15.519 --> 48:16.936
Huh?

48:16.937 --> 48:19.481
I mean, they might be bluffing.

48:19.482 --> 48:23.277
Although, let's put
ourselves in their place.

48:24.570 --> 48:27.114
Where would you be if she were dead?

48:27.573 --> 48:28.990
Where would I be if she was dead?

48:28.991 --> 48:31.201
- Where would you be if she were dead?
- Where would I be?

48:31.202 --> 48:32.494
Not you, sweetie.

48:32.495 --> 48:35.747
I mean, where would they
be if she were dead?

48:35.748 --> 48:37.332
- You mean if I were them?
- Yeah.

48:37.333 --> 48:40.377
Where would you be if she were dead?

49:07.154 --> 49:09.697
Hello, Mr. Taylor. Welcome back.

49:09.698 --> 49:12.867
Rodney, have you seen Mr. or
Mrs. Dawson the last few days?

49:12.868 --> 49:14.494
Frank and Mickey?

49:14.495 --> 49:16.204
Not since Sunday night.

49:16.205 --> 49:18.665
- Mickey either?
- No, sir.

49:37.518 --> 49:39.769
Detroit Police Department.
Please state your emergency.

49:39.770 --> 49:42.605
I think perhaps a woman's been taken.

49:42.606 --> 49:44.482
May I have your name, sir?

49:44.483 --> 49:47.110
She's a family friend.
Her name is Mickey.

49:47.111 --> 49:50.113
- Marsh!
- Just a minute, please.

49:50.656 --> 49:52.615
Marshmallow, what are you doing here?

49:52.616 --> 49:55.660
- Just making a phone call.
- Dad, why aren't you at work?

49:55.661 --> 49:57.579
Would you stop that?
Your father's on the phone.

49:57.580 --> 50:00.582
Hello? Are you there?

50:00.680 --> 50:02.239
Why? What am I doing?

50:02.240 --> 50:04.159
Just be clear about what you
want so I can understand you.

50:04.160 --> 50:07.519
I would like you to stop bouncing your ball
against the door so I can talk to Daddy.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.599
Please.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.501
Hey, man,
are you there? Are you there?

50:11.880 --> 50:13.759
- Okay, that'd be great.
- Hello? Sir...

50:13.760 --> 50:16.388
- Please.
- You, too. Bye now.

50:35.320 --> 50:37.424
You almost finished in there?

50:38.680 --> 50:42.468
- Where'd you learn to bandage like this?
- The Navy.

50:43.640 --> 50:45.439
You were a doctor?

50:46.140 --> 50:49.149
No, I was the one getting bandaged.

50:49.320 --> 50:50.981
Oh.

50:52.120 --> 50:55.942
Now this is what you do?
Kidnap people?

50:56.640 --> 50:58.904
No, you're my first.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.341
Ow.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.151
All right.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.799
Hey! Hey! Put the mask on!

51:14.800 --> 51:17.479
- Jesus!
- I've already... I've already seen you.

51:17.480 --> 51:19.823
With both of my eyes.

51:20.680 --> 51:22.909
At the country club.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.261
Okay?

51:28.160 --> 51:29.866
Come on.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.706
Oh, my...

51:41.680 --> 51:44.199
Oh, my gosh. Wow. Oh, my God.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.623
What, you don't like history?

51:48.520 --> 51:52.581
I hear this stuff's worth a
lot of money, what I'm told.

51:55.960 --> 51:58.269
When am I going home?

51:58.880 --> 52:01.109
He hasn't paid yet.

52:05.640 --> 52:09.781
Can I ask how much
are you asking for?

52:10.200 --> 52:12.065
A million.

52:13.000 --> 52:15.867
- A million dollars?
- He's got it.

52:16.000 --> 52:19.799
I told you that. Unless you can
think of a reason he won't pay.

52:19.800 --> 52:24.239
God. Oh, gosh, a million dollars.

52:24.240 --> 52:27.823
- It's just not gonna happen.
- What do you mean?

52:28.040 --> 52:31.225
- He's got it. I told you that.
- Oh, God.

52:43.680 --> 52:46.706
Tell me more about those apartments.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.759
Should I get it? Should we get it?

53:15.760 --> 53:17.279
- Do you want me to get it?
- Maybe you should get it.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.270
I can get it.

53:19.640 --> 53:21.471
I got it.

53:25.760 --> 53:27.879
Mr. Dawson's residence.
How can I help you?

53:27.880 --> 53:29.639
Put the man on.

53:29.640 --> 53:32.799
I'm afraid Mr. Dawson isn't here right now.
Would you care to leave a message?

53:32.800 --> 53:35.159
You tell the man get on the phone
if he wants to speak to his wife.

53:35.160 --> 53:37.279
Actually, Mr. Dawson left the
island this morning on a boat

53:37.280 --> 53:38.639
and didn't mention when he'd be back.

53:38.640 --> 53:40.299
Have a good day.

53:40.800 --> 53:44.559
I used to be a receptionist
for this PR guy in LA.

53:44.560 --> 53:47.359
The guy was a real asshole, but actually
I made a lot of interesting friends.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.479
So it was a good experience
overall, I mean.

53:49.480 --> 53:52.479
- What did he say?
- He didn't really say anything.

53:52.480 --> 53:55.506
He just asked for you, and then
he said he knew you were here.

53:55.840 --> 53:58.547
- How would he know that?
- He's just guessing.

53:58.640 --> 54:00.479
He doesn't know shit.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.982
- Motherfucker.
- Call again.

54:04.040 --> 54:06.919
Well, what happen when I call
and she don't put him on again?

54:06.920 --> 54:09.468
How the fuck we look then?

54:10.240 --> 54:13.710
- I'll call him.
- Don't get cute.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.399
This shit is not a game.

54:15.400 --> 54:17.959
- Then I'll call.
- I got it! I got it!

54:19.360 --> 54:21.908
Shit is not a game, ma'am.

54:44.960 --> 54:47.827
- I'll get it. I'll get it!
- I'm getting it!

54:47.880 --> 54:50.223
Sit down, Frank! Sit!

54:51.680 --> 54:53.559
- Hello.
- Yeah, put the man on.

54:53.560 --> 54:56.559
I can't very well put him on if
he's not here, now, can I, sport?

54:56.560 --> 54:59.759
Who this? This Melanie
with the big titties?

54:59.760 --> 55:02.159
Well, yes, it is,
and who am I speaking to?

55:02.160 --> 55:04.879
You tell Frank that if he want
to speak to his wife again,

55:04.880 --> 55:06.719
he need to get on
the phone right now.

55:06.720 --> 55:09.439
Well, he can't get on the phone
right now, 'cause he's not here.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.624
- Ciao.
- Look, I...

55:11.960 --> 55:14.064
He knew my name.

55:14.840 --> 55:16.879
What'd he want?

55:16.880 --> 55:21.066
Didn't really say anything.
He just wanted to talk to you.

55:21.280 --> 55:23.079
He sounded like a black guy.

55:23.080 --> 55:25.719
Well, I might know the guy,
recognize his voice.

55:25.720 --> 55:28.119
- Maybe I should get it next time.
- Mmm-mmm.

55:28.120 --> 55:30.199
You don't have anything
to say, Frank, do you?

55:30.200 --> 55:31.639
- You know what I'm thinking?
- What?

55:31.640 --> 55:33.221
Unplug the phone.

56:33.160 --> 56:34.866
Officer?

56:37.720 --> 56:39.301
Sir.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.709
Live in these premises?

56:43.720 --> 56:48.439
I'm a friend of the family.
Is there a problem, Officer?

56:48.440 --> 56:50.271
Oh.

56:50.320 --> 56:51.821
No.

56:52.160 --> 56:53.821
Just, uh...

56:55.160 --> 57:00.348
You know, doing an investigation
into a possible burglary

57:02.000 --> 57:03.919
in the neighborhood.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.501
Uh...

57:05.880 --> 57:08.826
You hear any disturbances lately?

57:09.760 --> 57:14.584
Well, maybe. Not personally, but no.
I really don't think so.

57:15.960 --> 57:18.349
Those suits were mine.

57:19.000 --> 57:20.547
Uh-huh.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.703
Love these Furies.

57:45.200 --> 57:48.479
- My friend lives here, Frank Dawson.
- Who?

57:48.480 --> 57:52.999
Frank Dawson. He asked me
to stop by and walk his dog.

57:53.000 --> 57:55.264
That's why I'm here.

57:56.480 --> 57:58.186
Really?

58:01.320 --> 58:03.026
What, uh...

58:03.760 --> 58:05.799
- That's a...
- What happened to your head there?

58:05.800 --> 58:09.144
A car accident. Damn
buck jumped out at me.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.021
I'm, uh...

58:12.040 --> 58:13.839
- I'm gonna have to ask you...
- What happened to your eye?

58:13.840 --> 58:15.819
I'm gonna have to ask
you to turn off the car.

58:16.560 --> 58:18.919
- Why?
- I said turn off the car.

58:18.920 --> 58:21.239
- Step out of the vehicle.
- Why?

58:21.240 --> 58:25.239
Turn off the car. Step out
of the goddamn vehicle!

59:42.480 --> 59:47.065
I don't know. I had a feeling,
but you're the one had it first.

59:47.920 --> 59:52.141
Somebody that you hadn't planned on,
you didn't know about.

59:52.760 --> 59:55.679
She's down there picking up that phone.
We're not gonna get through to him.

59:55.680 --> 59:57.999
So we know they're up there,
but what are they saying?

59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.559
Checking our temperature,
that's what they doing.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.839
Seeing if we serious.

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.866
We should go down there,
show him something.

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.748
Like his wife's fingers.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.079
Just like maybe the
wedding ring finger.

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.319
He already knows we got her.

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.788
No. No.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:21.519
We need to make an impression.
They think it's a game.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.863
Hey, he knows.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.999
It's just a lot of money. It's not
a decision you make in an hour.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.471
It's been two days,
Louis, going on three.

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.990
Her time is up.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.501
Hey.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:39.719
Don't start no shit
you can't finish, Louis.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.719
You need to calm down.
You're not thinking this through.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.399
What you think we doing here?
We ain't boosting no car.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.631
We took a woman. Now what?
You want to be nice?

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.079
Oh, you got some other
shit on your mind.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.759
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.719
It ain't about what you feel.
It's about what you're gonna do.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.426
How you handle yourself
in a situation like this.

01:00:56.560 --> 01:00:59.279
The man want to take his time, and the
woman wanna hang up the phone on us.

01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.159
The fuck we supposed to do?
Come on, man.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.559
Stop touching me!

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:05.999
Either he cares what happens
to her, or he doesn't give a shit!

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.831
Finger isn't gonna do anything!

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:11.759
He gives us the finger,
tells us to shove it up our ass!

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.359
I'm not disagreeing with you.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.350
You're right.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.709
We need to find a way to
put him against the wall.

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:25.428
So, we go down there and
leave Richard here with her?

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.239
I thought about it, too.

01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.742
Yeah, and what you think?

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:36.422
You go. I'll stay. You got Cedric.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:40.439
I think one of us has gotta
stay here, not just Richard.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.159
In fact, I'm gonna insist on it.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.981
All right, that's cool. I'll go.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.060
Me and Cedric got it.

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.719
You gonna be all right,
just you and Richard here?

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:57.747
Yeah, we get along, if I
don't have to talk to him.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.039
You all right, man?

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:05.119
Look like you got things on your mind.
You worried about something?

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:08.146
Oh, no, I'm not worried
about anything.

01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:13.747
Never been happier in my life.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:41.701
Ah!

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.159
Do you mind? It's my bag.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:47.503
No, I don't, actually.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.479
All right. Well, you can take my money,
my Coppertone, and Kleenex,

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.187
but leave my driver's license.

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:00.909
Took me months to get.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.420
Melanie.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.390
Is he upstairs?

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:09.548
Or did he leave the island?

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:11.861
Oh.

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.941
Yeah. "Oh."

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:25.587
Help! I can't swim!

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:28.061
Help!

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:30.479
Please!

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:33.119
You want to tell us where he at now?

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.279
Yes! Please!

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.079
Ta-da.

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:05.399
Abracadabra.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.665
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, screwdriver.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.599
- Coming right up.
- Why don't you give him a call, sweetie?

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.679
All right. I got something
to tell you first.

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.980
Think it's gonna mess up your scam,
but don't blame me, okay?

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.199
It's the timing.

01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:23.639
What timing?

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.144
He filed for divorce two days
before he came down here.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:32.828
When she gets back, if she gets back,
the divorce papers are waiting for her.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:35.267
Huh.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.239
You tell him he's never
gonna see his wife again.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.479
He doesn't want to
see his wife again.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.030
You just saved him maybe
100 grand a year in alimony.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:50.185
- He said that to you?
- He didn't have to. I know him.

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.959
You told him not to go to
the cops, so he won't.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.879
And legally, he's not supposed
to deal with extortionists.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.667
So he's in the free and clear.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.159
So we just let her go home?

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:06.639
And then he goes home and gets divorced,
but where does that leave you?

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:10.319
Look, I'm willing to cooperate
with you 'cause I like you.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.119
- I feel bad for you.
- Aw, you do?

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:16.022
And I don't want to end up
in the fucking ocean again.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.439
Cooperate how?

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.829
What about if you...

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:23.701
You disappeared for 100 grand?

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:27.239
- A hundred grand?
- A hundred thousand.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.559
I think that's a good
choice for you right now.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:30.759
It ain't a million.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.439
No, but it's not a sack of wet
shit either. Do you want my help?

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.999
Listen, you're not getting
a million bucks from him.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.867
You couldn't even get
it out of the country.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.863
All I'm saying is quit
dreaming and get realistic.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.861
You might as well get something.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.824
But if she were dead,
I could get you more.

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.341
Oh.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:56.823
Yeah. "Oh."

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.863
- Hello.
- Hey, Richard, it's me. Where Louis?

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.759
- I'll get him.
- No, hold on. Hold on, Richard.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:30.319
Listen, Richard. I got something to tell you
and I need you to tell Louis, all right?

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:31.919
We all set here, man.

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.279
- You going to California.
- Don't kid me.

01:06:34.280 --> 01:06:36.599
You teasing me?
Don't tease me on this one.

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.919
No. I'm not kidding you.
I'm not kidding you at all.

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.788
- For real? It's all set?
- Yeah, we all set.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.119
Now Louis upstairs, yeah?

01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:48.519
He's always upstairs.
I think he's fucking her.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.959
He's fucking us by fucking her.

01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:53.919
But, you know, I go up there,
and they're not doing it.

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.079
Hey, Richard, listen, uh...

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.239
I need you to take the
lady home tonight.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:01.119
I think he fucks her fast,
but he keeps...

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.439
Richard, listen to me, man.
Listen very carefully.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.944
I need you to tell Louis
to go and get a car.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:12.119
Put the woman in the trunk of the car.
You take her on home, okay?

01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:13.439
Uh-huh.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.639
You tell Louis to follow you.

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.782
You take the woman in the house.
You put her in the closet. You lock her up.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.559
Cut the phone wires so you got
time to get away from the house.

01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.079
Matter of fact, tie her
with them same phone wires.

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:27.627
You understand?

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.599
- Richard?
- Huh, what?

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:34.991
Okay. Now, Richard,
this next part is very important.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.830
You got to do it without
Louis knowing, too.

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:43.466
When he's gone, I need you
to go back to the house.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:48.228
I need you to kill the lady.

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.399
- I do?
- Yeah, you do. You need to kill her.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.629
The whole cigarette
burn incident shit.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:58.159
- She knows who you are, man.
- She told you that?

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:00.999
She heard your name, she saw your face.
That's what the Jew lady told me, man.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.319
She said she knows who you are.

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:06.039
You know, I wondered about that.
I did. I wondered about that.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.599
You ain't got no choice, man.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.999
I don't want to see you, I don't want to
see nobody go to jail behind this, man.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.839
So, you know, you gotta
take the Jew lady out.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:17.279
But listen. You cannot tell Louis.

01:08:17.279 --> 01:08:20.180
- You know something?
- What's that?

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:25.423
I knew she was a Jew. I could tell.

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.679
Hey, Rollo. What's happening, man?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.911
Look here, I wanna ask
you a question. Uh...

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.959
Does that look like
wild parsley to you?

01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:38.428
You mean that marijuana?

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.639
Say, look there, baby. It's just
about ready to be harvested, too.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.225
Yeah, I know. Get a car.
What else did he say?

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.879
- I told you.
- I mean his exact words.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:54.198
His exact words were, "It's all set."

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.198
What does that mean?
Why didn't he ask to talk to me?

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.759
Because he said I could tell you.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:05.399
It was all set about taking the woman
home, about you going and getting a car,

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.879
about you putting her in the trunk.

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:10.064
That's all he goddamn said, man!

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:12.345
What are you getting mad for?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.591
I ain't mad.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.581
It's just when I say
something, it's the truth.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.519
Yeah. That's cool, Richard.
Nothing to be upset about, man.

01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.751
I just wanna make
sure I understand it.

01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:30.389
You know what I mean?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:33.910
He said it's all set
and he had the money.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:35.907
Ah.

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:40.902
I must have missed that part.
He did get the money.

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:43.828
Good. See, I was
wondering about that.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:47.439
- Where you going?
- To get a car, like he said.

01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:51.911
Line up transportation for tonight.
I'll be back in a half-hour.

01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:56.907
Guess what.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:00.904
You're going home.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.224
- When?
- Later on.

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:13.021
- He paid you?
- We're gonna drop you home in a little bit.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.589
Wait a second. Wait.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:20.031
My husband paid you?

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:24.749
I guess he must have.

01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:27.319
- But you're not sure.
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.359
Eat your dinner. It's ham and
cabbage with creamed corn.

01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.908
No. Something's not right.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:34.479
- I don't believe you.
- I gotta go downstairs. I'll be back.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.759
Wait a second. Listen.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.466
Are you gonna kill me?

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:39.919
No.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.599
Come on. I will not say a word.

01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.839
I will not go to the police.
I won't say anything.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.661
- Won't help your husband any.
- Wait!

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.519
This doesn't happen this way!

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.751
Mickey, take it easy.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.744
I say you're going home,
you're going home.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.381
Thank you. Great meal as always.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:04.839
Hey, kid. That's me over there,
black Chevelle, white stripe.

01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:07.502
- Just a sec, boss.
- Be careful with it.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:38.879
Oh, God.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:47.544
Didn't eat your ham.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.987
No, I didn't. I wasn't hungry.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.660
I forgot.

01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.141
You're not allowed to eat it.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:02.786
Sorry. Why am I not
allowed to eat it?

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.825
Your religion.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.746
If you want to call it that.

01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.986
What?

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:19.711
He tell you? Louis?

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.279
You're going home.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.829
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, he did. He told me.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.071
So I guess

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.547
you guys got your money, huh?

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:39.827
I'm gonna miss you around here.

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:45.467
It's been such a lovely time.

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.341
What?

01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.670
What'd you say?

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:55.184
Nothing. I didn't say anything.

01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.702
- What'd you say?
-  Nothing.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:01.701
No.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.279
Please, please, no!

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.119
- Kiss me. Kiss me.
- No! No!

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.679
- You don't like me?
-  Please, no!

01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:10.864
Kiss me. Kiss me!

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.919
What, I'm not good enough for you?

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.639
- Please. Please.
- Take your clothes off.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:22.199
Take them off,
or I will rip them off!

01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.031
Stop!

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.750
Now the brassiere.

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.906
Do it. Do it.

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:43.390
- Hey!
- Huh?

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.062
What's going on up there?

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:57.108
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
- Okay!

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.340
Let's go. Come on. This way.

01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.941
Hold on.

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:37.622
- You all right?
- No.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.628
- You shot?
- No.

01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:01.159
- 7-442.
- Yeah, go ahead, 442.

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:05.984
Yeah, I'm at 1,000 block,
State and Fair, east of Woodward.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.999
Requesting immediate backup.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:11.947
I got some wild-looking asshole
here firing a handgun.

01:16:39.160 --> 01:16:41.708
Where are you taking me?

01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:46.469
Where am I taking you?
I'm taking you home.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.559
Right here,
this stretch of Northwood,

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:07.190
where it used to be called the
street-racing capital of the world.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.548
I don't want to go home.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:52.267
So that's the Florentine, huh?
What else you got?

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:56.599
Listen, Ordell,
we got a minor problem.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:18:00.799
Actually, we've got some good news
and some not such good news.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.959
Had a feeling you had some news.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.639
He's going back tomorrow.
He's leaving.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.119
And now that he's out of the
casino and back on the wagon,

01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.759
he's in a pretty good place,
all things considered.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.839
That's the not-so-good news.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:15.959
He wants to get back, make an appearance,
see his wife, call off the divorce,

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:18.399
but he wants me to come
back to Detroit with him.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.319
I just reminded him that I'm the only
person he has to talk to about this,

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:25.279
you know, the sympathetic listener.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.719
This is the good news?

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:29.719
Well, the bad isn't exactly bad and
the good isn't exactly sensational.

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.719
But what it does do is it
gets things back to normal.

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:36.199
You've got little Mickey back
with hubby, assuming she's alive.

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.907
Oh, which reminds me,
you should really call your friend.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:42.199
It actually gives you time to
set this up and do it right.

01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:43.399
I mean, you're a hunk,

01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:46.631
but you are a piss-poor extortionist,
if you don't mind me saying.

01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:50.150
Let's be honest. This could've
been set up a whole lot better.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.279
This motherfucker's
got way too many guns

01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.260
and from what I can tell,
no shortage of ammo.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.439
When we first saw him,

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.479
he had on a T-shirt and long
johns, armed with a revolver.

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.559
Now he got on some
kind of damn uniform.

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:07.439
Busted in all the windows, except the
ones boarded up on the second floor.

01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:09.319
Turn off the music and
put down the weapon.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.119
Did he say anything?

01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:15.319
He keeps saying something about the Fury
or the fuhrer, maybe. I don't know.

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:18.391
It wasn't making much sense,
and he was crying through most of it.

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:20.759
Okay.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.279
Ray, where you going?

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:26.341
Sir, you have two minutes
to exit the premises!

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:32.026
- Get back!
- Take cover! Take cover!

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.707
- Hey.
- What?

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.421
Louis?

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.711
Smoked grass, and I'm drinking beer.

01:20:37.720 --> 01:20:40.063
And I don't even like beer.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.799
And that pizza, it was delicious.

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:45.799
Jesus Christ. How did
you know my name?

01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:47.759
Oh.

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:51.343
The fat guy told me,
that fake police guy.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.630
- He's not a real cop, right?
- He told you?

01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:59.239
Yeah. He did.

01:20:59.240 --> 01:21:02.319
You know, I was thinking
about something else.

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.119
- Yeah?
- The other guy, the black one.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.199
- Oh, "The black one."
- Yeah.

01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:08.319
Everyone knows everyone. That's good.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.279
He went down to Freeport, right?

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:14.227
'Cause I haven't heard his
voice for a couple of days.

01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.461
Where is he now?

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:18.679
He just called this afternoon.

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.399
He's still there, on his way back.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:26.079
He called, but you didn't speak to him.
The other guy spoke to him, right?

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.919
Because when I asked you
if my husband had paid you,

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:31.999
you said, "I think so."

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.679
Yeah. Richard told me,
so I didn't talk to him.

01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:37.479
Richard. Is that that guy's name?
That fat guy's name's Richard?

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:40.479
That's right, but I'll
tell you something.

01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.799
You need to forget everything

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:45.159
that you have seen and heard
over the last few days.

01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.028
Louis, you're not sure if
your partner was paid.

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.908
Oh, God, a million dollars?

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.944
Don't worry about it.

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.469
Don't worry about it.

01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:09.061
Hmm.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:30.861
Louis.

01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.581
Yeah?

01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.541
I think I'm ready to go home now.

01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.386
Okay.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:45.839
Two days before her recital,
Shelly asked me if she can quit.

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.479
I'd try and talk her out of it,
but I know she's scared.

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:51.479
We just had to do the
same thing with Andrew.

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:54.199
Taking him out of private school.
Too much pressure.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.119
I think it sends the wrong message.

01:23:56.120 --> 01:24:00.599
But I asked Marsh, and he says,
"It's a ballet recital. Who friggin' cares?"

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:02.879
That was really helpful.
Thanks, Marsh.

01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.479
Where you been all week, celebrity?

01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:07.279
I was kidnapped.

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:23.861
- What you thinking about?
- Mickey!

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.187
- How are you? Oh, my God.
- I'm fine.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.319
You know, I've been worried sick
about you. Mick, what happened?

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.639
Did you even try to find out?

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:38.503
When I didn't hear
anything, of course I did.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.479
I tried to call you. I came by.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:45.159
I looked for you at
the club. You look good.

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.679
Marshall, there is a hole in my
closet door the size of you.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:52.639
Jesus, I know. Maybe if we
hurry up, we can get it fixed.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.639
The suits, I came by and
took them in. They're all clean.

01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.428
Marshall, do you even know
where I've been all week?

01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.147
- Mickey, listen.
- Talk.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.319
I'll pick up the suits.
You call a guy about the door.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:10.159
All right. I think I'll just
let you and Frank handle it.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.981
What do you mean? Frank? Mickey.

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:14.639
Roll down the window.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.904
Just for one second.

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.319
You all right?

01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.060
I'm fine.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.159
You want a drink?

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.661
Sure.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.584
When'd you get back?

01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:01.631
I just walked in.

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.464
Oh, you mean the flight.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.279
Did you stop and see
Bo on your way back?

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.351
Way back? No. Didn't have the time.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.719
There's been a few problems
on that Grandviewjob.

01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:15.839
All the sod that was supposed
to be in a month ago?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:19.787
I come back, none of the
landscaping is done.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:24.582
- Unbelievable.
- Or would you rather talk about golf?

01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.784
You asked me why I didn't see Bo.
I'm telling you.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:33.710
Did you pay them?

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.821
Didn't have to. They backed off.

01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:44.262
- When did they back off?
- When I wouldn't pay them.

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:51.869
It was a bluff. I called it.
That's all.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.469
- What if they weren't bluffing?
- But they were.

01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.119
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- What if they weren't bluffing, Frank?

01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:09.190
Okay, you're getting a
little hysterical here.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:11.639
I told them right from the
start I wasn't gonna pay.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:13.399
Okay. Did you go to the police?

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.639
No. I couldn't. They said if I did...
That's when they threatened your life.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.799
But I thought they
were bluffing, honey.

01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.279
This isn't simple to explain.

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.509
- Okay.
- At first, I didn't do anything.

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.829
And then I knew, as soon as I talked to
them again, I knew that they'd back off.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:33.279
And that there wasn't really
anything serious to worry about.

01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.159
Other than, of course,
what you went through.

01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:39.823
I imagine it was a pretty
frightening experience.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.462
You're not gonna tell me.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.319
But I know what you did,
you know what you did,

01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.300
and that's all that
matters, isn't it? So...

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:56.060
Isn't it?

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:03.599
I got the divorce papers. They were
waiting for me when I got home.

01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:08.708
Now, obviously they were sent way before
I knew anything about a kidnapping.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.519
Are you gonna marry her?

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.359
Listen, instead of discussing
what I feel is personal,

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:22.259
I think it was Henry Kissinger that said,
"Never complain. Never explain."

01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.509
That was Henry Ford,

01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:29.519
when he was arrested for
drunk driving in California

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.545
with another woman in his car.

01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:36.199
So...

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:39.783
What do I get? What's my
part of the settlement?

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:42.679
Well, we sell the house,
split the equity.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:46.159
It's about 200,000,
plus alimony, child support.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:50.551
And then we divide the money you're
sneaking into the Freeport account?

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:52.879
There is no Freeport
bank account in my name

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:56.159
and there is no possible
way anyone can prove it.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.599
You want to look in my books?

01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.239
Mmm-mmm.

01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:04.119
No, but I would like to see
your apartment buildings.

01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:09.319
Your refrigerators, ranges,
all of your appliances.

01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:13.399
- How you save money on stolen materials.
- How do you know about that?

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:17.347
And how you pay your old buddy
Ray Shelby to front you.

01:29:18.280 --> 01:29:20.399
And without even getting
into the kidnapping,

01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.959
I could stir up enough
to just nail your ass.

01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.639
Look, I don't know what
you think you know.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:26.585
Couldn't I?

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:32.591
I mean, if I was the type of person
that wanted to see you go to jail.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:38.788
- Frank.
- What?

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:42.791
Are you gonna marry...
What's her name?

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.599
I hope to.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:50.071
- You mean if you don't go to jail.
- No, that's not what I meant.

01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.799
Oh, we're just wasting time.

01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:54.879
Let's wait till I get a lawyer.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.959
Fine.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:59.559
But before you get an
expensive divorce lawyer,

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.639
just know it comes out
of the settlement.

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:03.999
Just so much in the kitty, kitty.

01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.786
Watch it.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.663
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

01:30:12.520 --> 01:30:14.306
Did they

01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:19.465
take advantage of you or...

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.546
Mmm-mmm.

01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:27.388
Something happened to you.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.504
You're different.

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:36.341
Hey.

01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:40.870
Finally changed your clothes.
You look nice.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.479
Fancy pants.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.719
These are my culottes.

01:30:45.720 --> 01:30:48.268
Well, they're pretty cool.

01:30:48.520 --> 01:30:51.864
- And no bra?
- I have one on.

01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.871
I have more than one bra.

01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:58.860
Anyway, I gotta tell you somethin'.

01:31:00.040 --> 01:31:02.159
- Hear that?
- What?

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:05.504
"I gotta tell you somethin'."
I sound like you.

01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.391
I say that?

01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.439
Anyway, what I was gonna say was,
I didn't come for this bra.

01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:14.959
I just... I needed somebody
to talk to, and, you know...

01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:16.679
Is it all right that I
just invited myself?

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.559
Yeah, sure. Sure, it is,
but there's one problem.

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:22.719
See, I was trying to talk to
my husband finally and...

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.949
Wait. What problem?

01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:29.239
Oh, Ordell is back. I know that.

01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:31.399
Yeah, but he's not alone.

01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:35.422
They expressing themselves.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.546
Enchantée.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:48.985
Hello, Mickey.

01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:52.466
Ordell.

01:31:54.040 --> 01:31:55.780
Oh, please.

01:31:57.360 --> 01:31:59.305
Make yourself comfortable.
Have a seat.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.231
I just was in the neighborhood, thought
I'd stop by, say hi to the old gang.

01:32:05.120 --> 01:32:10.023
Oh, no, we ain't no gang.
We just, you know, some folks.

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:12.479
Uh.

01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:16.079
Mickey, meet Melanie.
Melanie, Mickey.

01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.627
Hi.

01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.987
Hi.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:25.461
- How's Frank?
- Frank's great.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:30.310
Guys, what's going on? Mickey?

01:32:31.120 --> 01:32:34.039
Louis, who's your friend?

01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.828
I thought you two were introduced.
Melanie, Mickey.

01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:42.988
- Bullshit.
- Mickey says her old man's divorcing her.

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.399
Really?

01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:47.981
Mmm.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.359
And I don't want to interfere
with his new life.

01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:53.305
Mine, either.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.264
This is the part where I say what?

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:59.359
What, you don't believe me?

01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:01.039
Uh-uh.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.559
Do you want me to describe
the apartment in Freeport?

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:05.824
Ordell's been there.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.559
All right.

01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.667
Well, how about the birthmark two
inches from the base of his spine?

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:15.584
Assuming, of course,
that you've been there.

01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.027
- I gotta take a leak.
- Just sit still. Sit still.

01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:25.464
Hold on. Hmm.

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.182
Now the woman said that
the man is gonna divorce her.

01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.559
He's not coming back. He don't
want to make a new start.

01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:35.519
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hmm.

01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.679
So I got it wrong, baby. I mean,

01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:41.239
I can't help if he tells her one
thing and then tells me another.

01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:43.504
Or if she's pissed.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:46.190
Are you mad at anybody?

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.708
No, not at all.

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.104
No, she's not mad.

01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:57.104
This is bullshit.
Would you mind terribly?

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:03.999
Hmm.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:07.663
There she goes, future Mrs. Dawson.

01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.747
She looks like a million bucks.

01:34:20.240 --> 01:34:23.471
Did he tell you he
was gonna marry her?

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:27.427
And live with her until he does.

01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.946
Hmm.

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:34.021
Hmm!

01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:44.839
You know, guys,
I was thinking we should call Frank
