00:01.000 --> 00:02.524
Previously on
"Pretty Little Liars.."

00:02.630 --> 00:04.621
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

00:04.730 --> 00:06.493
Did you tell Yvonne
to leave her phone at lunch?

00:06.600 --> 00:08.136
Yes, wanted me
to find something.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.309
The night Charlotte came home

00:09.410 --> 00:10.536
the night she was murdered.

00:10.640 --> 00:11.766
'Someone used the landline from'

00:11.870 --> 00:13.406
'the Two Crows
to call this house.‘

00:13.510 --> 00:15.398
I will got to my boss
and I will tell her the truth.

00:15.510 --> 00:16.078
You can't do that.

00:16.180 --> 00:17.545
She'll kick you to the curb.

00:17.650 --> 00:18.776
Melissa's suitcase is broken.

00:18.880 --> 00:20.347
The pull up handle
is missing a rod.

00:20.450 --> 00:21.712
It could have been used
as a weapon.

00:21.820 --> 00:23.549
Jordan, sorry I haven't
called you back.

00:23.650 --> 00:25.186
I think I picked a date.

00:25.290 --> 00:27.383
The Phillips camp believes
the leak came out of our office.

00:27.490 --> 00:29.128
- It's about her daughter.
- Yvonne?

00:29.230 --> 00:31.027
She got rid
of an unwanted pregnancy.

00:31.130 --> 00:32.222
I leaked it.

00:32.330 --> 00:34.025
Gather your things
and leave here.

00:34.130 --> 00:35.427
Go in there
and tell my mother the truth.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.168
If there needs_ to be
a scapegoat, let It be me.

00:37.270 --> 00:38.794
(Emily)
They may have found the weapon.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.731
And they were willing
to kill me to get it back.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.398
Did Sara Harvey come after you?

00:42.510 --> 00:44.569
It wasn't her. Sara Harvey
wants this murder solved.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.035
Whoever this was..

00:46.140 --> 00:47.072
...they wanna cover it up.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.579
You want me to marry you

00:48.680 --> 00:49.601
to each other?

00:51.180 --> 00:52.670
It's just so weird,
I mean, I barely

00:52.780 --> 00:55.169
know the guy's first name
and now he's married to Ali?

00:55.280 --> 00:57.714
Right, well, I'm sure
he seems like a stranger to us

00:57.820 --> 01:01.085
but Alison and Elliot have
known each other for years.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.828
Hey, they just
started going out!

01:02.930 --> 01:04.727
I mean, what is this,
her second date?

01:04.830 --> 01:06.297
What ever happened
to dinner and a movie?

01:06.400 --> 01:09.619
Um, Han..
There's lipstick on that fork.

01:09.730 --> 01:12.130
Ew.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.832
[sighs]
I'm sure it seems strange

01:13.940 --> 01:16.204
but if you saw
Alison and Elliot

01:16.310 --> 01:18.335
it was...it was pretty romantic.

01:18.440 --> 01:20.579
I don't think romance
has anything to do with it.

01:20.680 --> 01:23.171
Ali's lost everyone
she's ever cared about.

01:23.280 --> 01:24.599
She's desperate for a family.

01:24.710 --> 01:26.211
Maybe she's smart.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.311
If you elope, no one
can throw you a bridal shower.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.342
Since when do you
not like bridal showers?

01:30.450 --> 01:34.079
Gifts, expensive lingerie, cake?
Like, made for you.

01:34.190 --> 01:35.851
Not when we have
two monsters after us.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.382
Spencer's not answering.

01:37.490 --> 01:38.627
Yeah, well,
she's probably still dealing

01:38.730 --> 01:40.698
with the fallout
from the Yvonne leak.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.360
There's no way Spencer's parents
will believe Caleb did that.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.199
Yeah, well, be glad that they do
because if they thought

01:45.300 --> 01:46.392
that we had a new A,
they would march

01:46.500 --> 01:47.637
straight down
to the police station.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.628
You guys, our stalker
already warned us. Okay?

01:49.740 --> 01:51.731
If we talk to the cops we're
gonna have targets on our backs.

01:51.840 --> 01:53.376
We already do!

01:53.480 --> 01:55.232
Melissa tried to turn me into
road kIll last nIght.

01:55.340 --> 01:56.773
No, she is not
the one sending texts

01:56.880 --> 01:58.370
and going after Yvonne.

01:58.480 --> 01:59.242
[sighs]

01:59.950 --> 02:00.871
Spencer could just...te|| Toby

02:01.720 --> 02:02.311
I mean,
he could quietly go and--

02:03.020 --> 02:03.384
No, if we talk to Toby there's

02:04.020 --> 02:04.714
nothing quiet about that.

02:05.820 --> 02:07.310
The whole Rosewood police force
will be on a manhunt.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.222
Okay, can we just talk about
something nice for a second?

02:09.760 --> 02:10.579
I want my cake back.

02:11.530 --> 02:13.225
Check out the pictures
from the wedding.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.728
Aw, your parents look so happy.

02:16.830 --> 02:18.229
Great job on the dress, Han.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.733
That's weird.
I'm in this picture.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.637
Wonder who took this one.

02:26.740 --> 02:29.174
[intense music]

02:29.280 --> 02:31.339
(Emily)
What is that?

02:32.880 --> 02:35.178
(Aria)
'Wait, there's more.‘

02:36.690 --> 02:38.646
Oh, my God.

02:43.690 --> 02:46.295
* Got a secret
can you keep It *

02:46.400 --> 02:48.925
* Swear this one you'll save

02:49.030 --> 02:51.396
_* Better lock it
In your pocket *

02:51.500 --> 02:53.832
* Taking this one to the grave

02:53.940 --> 02:58.764
* If I show you then I know you
won't tell what I said *

02:58.870 --> 03:04.308
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead **

03:06.320 --> 03:07.446
[cell phone buzzing]

03:07.550 --> 03:09.347
Obviously Gil
diffused the situation

03:09.450 --> 03:11.179
and your mom has
apologized to Yvonne

03:11.290 --> 03:12.848
and her family. And she..

03:12.960 --> 03:15.178
Could you please turn that off
while I'm talking?

03:15.290 --> 03:17.178
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.224
[sighs]
Several members of the press

03:19.330 --> 03:20.820
have caught wind
of the fact that

03:20.930 --> 03:22.329
the "social media consultant"

03:22.430 --> 03:23.966
that was responsible
for all the leaks

03:24.070 --> 03:25.560
is your boyfriend.

03:25.670 --> 03:28.298
I think it would be wise
to put out a statement

03:28.400 --> 03:30.209
you know,
distancing yourself from him.

03:30.310 --> 03:32.198
What? Why?

03:32.310 --> 03:34.471
This morning Toby
spoke with the media.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.808
Issued a personal statement.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.343
- He did?
- Yeah.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.940
Naturally voicing his support

03:39.050 --> 03:40.677
for his girlfriend
and taking a swipe

03:40.780 --> 03:42.680
at .our .
"nasty political tactics."

03:43.750 --> 03:46.310
Does he know that
it was Caleb who did it?

03:46.420 --> 03:48.285
I-why are you
so protective of Caleb?

03:48.390 --> 03:50.426
[scoffs]
I mean, come on, Spence.

03:50.530 --> 03:53.454
Don't we all have a better idea
of who he really IS now?

03:59.770 --> 04:02.238
1-1 have to go
to the campaign office.

04:02.340 --> 04:03.432
Um...Dad?

04:03.540 --> 04:05.667
Would you please tell Melissa
to call me?

04:05.770 --> 04:07.408
She hasn't been answering
her phone.

04:07.510 --> 04:08.670
She left for London.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.771
- Her office needed her back.
- What?

04:10.880 --> 04:13.269
Wait, why would she leave
right before the election?

04:13.380 --> 04:14.745
'Why don't you
stop worrying about Melissa'

04:14.850 --> 04:17.944
and start focusing your
attention on helping your mom?

04:18.050 --> 04:20.553
Also might want to think about
what you'll say to Toby.

04:22.990 --> 04:26.289
[instrumental music]

04:52.920 --> 04:55.855
[music continues]

05:03.700 --> 05:06.897
Is this too risque
for the party?

05:07.000 --> 05:09.468
You know what, honestly, maybe
we should just cancel the party.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.538
You know, reschedule it
for another time.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.779
Your hotel has that big thing
for election night and--

05:13.880 --> 05:17.646
The party is tomorrow.
We can't cancel.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.411
You have friends
coming in from New York--

05:19.520 --> 05:21.818
And I have friends
who have already left.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.912
Ali can't come.
She had to go out of town.

05:25.020 --> 05:26.783
It's a long story.

05:26.890 --> 05:31.088
Okay, well, maybe now
you can invite Mona instead.

05:31.190 --> 05:32.282
Honey, it's
the first time in years

05:32.400 --> 05:34.595
that you and your friends
have all been in the same place.

05:34.700 --> 05:37.669
Yeah, because
of a murder investigation.

05:37.770 --> 05:38.725
[sighs]

05:38.830 --> 05:40.661
You need this.

05:40.770 --> 05:41.862
All of you do.

05:41.970 --> 05:43.858
It will be a good distraction.

05:44.870 --> 05:45.507
[door opens]

05:45.610 --> 05:47.635
How was your parents wedding?

05:47.740 --> 05:49.799
Um, good.

05:49.910 --> 05:51.343
Good. Small.

05:52.080 --> 05:53.945
Did you want something to eat?

05:54.050 --> 05:55.449
Oh, no, I can't stay long.

05:55.550 --> 05:56.915
I'm going to lunch with Liam.

05:57.020 --> 05:59.580
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

05:59.690 --> 06:01.578
He seems, he seems bright.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.759
He is.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.748
He's very bright.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.124
Look, um, I-I came here

06:10.230 --> 06:11.891
because I needed to know

06:12.000 --> 06:14.935
what you wanted me to do.

06:15.040 --> 06:15.995
About the-the book.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.136
How do you want me
to handle it?

06:18.240 --> 06:20.504
So, I-I might have
already handled it.

06:20.610 --> 06:23.647
I spoke to Jillian this morning.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.047
Cause I wanted to
give you credit and

06:25.150 --> 06:27.038
make sure that you didn't
lose your job over this

06:27.150 --> 06:29.641
and I sort of ended up..

06:29.750 --> 06:32.048
...pitching you as co-writer.

06:32.150 --> 06:33.378
What?

06:33.490 --> 06:34.650
Well, I mean, she-she loved

06:34.760 --> 06:35.988
the female voice that you gave

06:36.090 --> 06:37.557
and I suggested that we..

06:37.660 --> 06:38.786
...write the book together.

06:38.890 --> 06:41.495
Sort of a_-a man
and woman in dialogue.

06:43.730 --> 06:44.719
I'm so sorry,
I probably should've

06:44.830 --> 06:45.922
talked to you about this first.

06:46.030 --> 06:47.395
No, don't be!

06:47.500 --> 06:49.661
1-1 am so, so flattered.

06:49.770 --> 06:52.933
But.. No Jillian's
never gonna go for that.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.701
- I'm an assistant over there.
- Aria.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.971
Jillian seems open to this.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.514
So...are you?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.649
Wait, how did this happen?

07:04.750 --> 07:05.682
(Emily)
'More like "How did we'

07:05.790 --> 07:06.950
not see this coming?"

07:07.060 --> 07:08.812
Melissa's done this
so many times before

07:08.920 --> 07:11.650
she probably has some special
fugitive rate from the airlines.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.193
Okay, so the only way
we'll be able to

07:13.300 --> 07:14.653
confront her is on Video Chat?

07:14.760 --> 07:15.920
Doesn't matter,
I'll just have to prove

07:16.030 --> 07:17.964
she did it
without her actually being here.

07:18.070 --> 07:19.560
Oh, and by the way,
your mom called

07:19.670 --> 07:21.160
about the bar menu
for the shower.

07:21.270 --> 07:22.601
What's a pink drink?

07:22.710 --> 07:24.507
[sighs]
Oh, God.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.963
Is she talking about
some kind of..

07:26.070 --> 07:27.537
[whistling]

07:27.640 --> 07:28.971
[instrumental music]

07:29.080 --> 07:30.001
Em?

07:30.110 --> 07:31.042
[whistling continues]

07:31.150 --> 07:32.447
'Em, are you there?‘

07:32.550 --> 07:33.949
I've heard that sound before.

07:42.830 --> 07:44.684
Alright,
I will place a rush order.

07:44.790 --> 07:47.554
And hopefully,
the stock we have will last..

07:47.660 --> 07:49.025
...until we can..

07:49.130 --> 07:51.724
I-I'll stay in a broom closet.

uh

07:53.570 --> 07:54.594
excuse me a second?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.759
I need a place to say.

07:56.870 --> 07:57.837
Caleb?

07:57.940 --> 07:59.100
Is everything okay?

07:59.210 --> 08:01.075
Uh, yeah, uh, Ijust, uh, I..

08:01.180 --> 08:02.943
I'm just trying
to get a room for tonight.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.507
I thought you were
staying with the Hastings.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.838
Yeah, I was.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.611
When I was working
on the campaign.

08:08.720 --> 08:10.745
Uh, which I no longer am.

08:12.590 --> 08:14.683
What happened?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.027
Alright, I'll tell you what,
why don't I make some calls

08:19.130 --> 08:20.199
to some other hotels and maybe--

08:20.300 --> 08:22.029
No, no, thank you.

08:22.130 --> 08:24.769
I already tried actually.

08:24.870 --> 08:26.929
This was sort of my last stop.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.704
Thanks.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.903
Caleb!

08:34.010 --> 08:36.649
You know, if you can't
find any place else to stay

08:36.750 --> 08:39.878
you can always stay
in the guest room.

08:39.980 --> 08:41.641
You know it well.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.843
There's probably still
one of your old beanies

08:43.950 --> 08:46.510
you know,
stuffed in the dresser.

08:46.620 --> 08:47.655
I actually, I left it for you.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.818
In case you ever
wanted to clean your

08:48.920 --> 08:50.228
chimney flue or something.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.651
[chuckles]

08:52.760 --> 08:55.092
I really appreciate the offer,
but, um..

08:55.200 --> 08:57.088
...I'll figure it out.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.677
Oh, hey.

09:10.780 --> 09:13.214
Hey. Oh, congratulations
on the book.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.947
Aria told us you maybe..

09:15.050 --> 09:17.712
[whistling]

09:17.820 --> 09:19.185
Annoying, isn't it?

09:19.290 --> 09:20.655
It's made even worse with

09:20.760 --> 09:22.682
zero sleep and
a writing deadline.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.678
Have-have you heard
that noise before?

09:24.790 --> 09:26.849
- Whistle-tips.
- Sorry?

09:26.960 --> 09:28.825
It's a piece that goes
in the exhaust pipe of car

09:28.930 --> 09:30.659
makes that
high-pitched whining sound.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.635
So you're saying that noise
is on purpose?

09:32.740 --> 09:35.334
Y-yeah, I think it's a
sad desperate plea for attention

09:35.440 --> 09:38.967
but I don't know, maybe
I'm cranky from lack of sleep.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.970
[instrumental music]

09:42.850 --> 09:45.205
Melissa, please, just call me

09:45.310 --> 09:46.675
the second
your plane lands, okay?

09:46.780 --> 09:48.577
I really need..

09:48.680 --> 09:49.886
[exhales deeply]

09:49.990 --> 09:52.584
I really need to talk to you.

09:52.690 --> 09:53.884
Bye.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.617
[knocking]

09:55.720 --> 09:57.779
I'm coming.

10:05.930 --> 10:07.932
Toby..

10:08.040 --> 10:09.166
Where is he?

10:09.270 --> 10:11.158
Caleb isn't here, okay?

10:11.270 --> 10:12.305
And I know you're upset--

10:12.410 --> 10:13.729
He knows her.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.104
She's not some
faceless, nameless..

10:16.210 --> 10:17.848
She's_ not even
a candidate, okay?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.918
She didn't choose to put
her life under a microscope.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.614
I know. But there's just so much
about this that you don't know.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.608
When the Phillips
campaign manager told me

10:24.720 --> 10:26.085
it was Caleb that did this

10:26.190 --> 10:27.316
I told him he-he must've

10:27.420 --> 10:29.149
had his wires crossed.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.284
I said "That there's no way."

10:30.390 --> 10:32.028
I told him, "I know this guy.

10:32.130 --> 10:33.859
"And I would bet my life
that he would never

10:33.960 --> 10:36.394
do something like this."

10:36.500 --> 10:38.627
I'm glad he didn't
take that bet.

10:38.730 --> 10:39.799
[door opens]

10:44.340 --> 10:45.898
Hey, Toby.

10:46.010 --> 10:48.228
Toby, hey,
just let him explain, okay?

10:48.340 --> 10:49.329
There's nothing to explain.

10:49.440 --> 10:52.045
She thought you were a friend.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.869
I thought you were a friend.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.311
I'm sorry she's hurting.

10:56.420 --> 10:58.809
Caleb, just tell him.

11:00.420 --> 11:02.684
Wow.

11:02.790 --> 11:05.020
So you're not even
going to deny it was you.

11:07.030 --> 11:08.952
No. I can't.

11:10.830 --> 11:11.797
I want to hear it from you!

11:11.900 --> 11:12.889
I want to hear it

11:13.000 --> 11:14.763
from your mouth.
Why you did this.

11:14.870 --> 11:17.839
Toby, stop, okay?
Caleb, tell him!

11:18.840 --> 11:20.933
I did what I had to do.

11:21.740 --> 11:23.105
[grunts]

11:23.210 --> 11:24.677
Oh, my God!

11:40.760 --> 11:42.967
I called the auto shop,
but no one answered.

11:43.070 --> 11:45.061
- So, I'm gonna go over there.
- And do what?

11:45.170 --> 11:46.797
Pretend like you're going to
tricking-out your sedan?

11:46.900 --> 11:48.265
It's not funny, Hanna.

11:48.370 --> 11:50.201
Once I can prove that
Melissa borrowed that SUV

11:50.310 --> 11:51.800
I'm telling the police.

11:51.910 --> 11:53.377
You saw the message
from this morning.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.072
We're running out of time.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.977
(Ashley)
'Hanna?

11:57.080 --> 11:59.105
[sighs]
Can you help me turn on the air?

11:59.210 --> 12:00.939
Um, earlier,
I tried to use the oven

12:01.050 --> 12:02.938
and Beyonce started playing.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.712
I told you, it's all linked up.
It's like a Smart Loft.

12:05.820 --> 12:08.254
Yeah, well, Smart Loft,
dumb hostess.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.056
I need two buttons, on and off.

12:17.500 --> 12:21.038
So I...ran into Caleb today.

12:21.140 --> 12:24.303
At the hotel.
He said he lost his job.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.264
Do you know what happened?

12:26.370 --> 12:28.804
Not exactly.

12:28.910 --> 12:30.207
Well, I hope
you don't mind but I

12:30.310 --> 12:31.447
offered him the guest room.

12:31.550 --> 12:33.142
Every place in town is booked.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.138
Wait. What?

12:35.250 --> 12:36.148
Mom, I-I do mind.

12:36.990 --> 12:38.742
You're gonna let him
stay in our house?

12:38.850 --> 12:40.408
My house and it seemed like

12:40.520 --> 12:41.885
he didn't have
any place else to go.

12:41.990 --> 12:43.526
He's an adult.
Not a pound puppy.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.825
Hanna!

12:45.930 --> 12:47.397
This is someone you cared about.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.092
He was a big part of your life.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.189
Just admit it.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.097
You like Caleb
more than you like Jordan.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.228
- What?
- You never gave him a chance.

12:55.370 --> 12:57.338
You've compared every guy
I've ever dated to Caleb--

12:57.440 --> 12:59.305
That's crazy.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.332
'I think Jordan is great.‘

13:01.440 --> 13:03.840
I just don't know him
as well as I know Caleb.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.474
Yeah, well, how could you?

13:05.580 --> 13:06.649
'You don't try
to spend time with him.‘

13:06.750 --> 13:09.173
I have invited you both
back here on multiple occasions.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.316
You know, forget it.
I don't wanna talk about this.

13:11.420 --> 13:14.218
Hey, Han? Um,
I'll see you later, okay?

13:15.590 --> 13:17.182
Yeah.

13:19.360 --> 13:20.896
Hold still.

13:21.930 --> 13:23.363
Do you want me
to do this or not?

13:23.470 --> 13:25.222
Not. I keep saying "not"

13:25.330 --> 13:26.297
and you keep ignoring me.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.288
Hold still.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.908
You should just tell him
the truth.

13:37.010 --> 13:38.307
Just gonna make things worse.

13:38.410 --> 13:40.344
How? How could it possibly

13:40.450 --> 13:41.519
make things any worse?

13:41.620 --> 13:42.814
What do you want to do?

13:42.920 --> 13:44.239
Do you want to waltz
into Rosewood PD

13:44.350 --> 13:46.511
and tell them to slap cuffs
on a girl with no hands?

13:46.620 --> 13:49.259
She has hands. And, yes.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.988
If I was sure that it was Sara
Harvey who's behind all of this.

13:52.090 --> 13:54.888
But she shut her
spy hole and she's left town.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.228
You don't think it's her?

13:56.330 --> 13:57.490
I don't know.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.022
Maybe somebody
who's helping her?

13:59.130 --> 14:00.859
But whoever it is,
their getting impatient.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.062
Because if we don't
give them the killer

14:02.170 --> 14:04.331
in the next
couple of days then..

14:06.110 --> 14:08.101
Don't.

14:08.210 --> 14:10.269
I'm not going to let
anybody hurt you.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.138
It's kind of hard for me
to take comfort from that

14:15.250 --> 14:17.343
when you still have blood
coming out of your nose.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.285
Come here.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.018
There.

14:29.030 --> 14:30.395
I'd rather have
Toby hate me now

14:30.500 --> 14:32.388
than blame me later, you know?

14:33.600 --> 14:35.898
I know.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.238
You did not have to do all this.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.240
I would've been fine just eating
leftovers from the wedding.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.409
No, that's what
an expense account is for.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.444
Taking my girlfriend out
for a porcini omelet

14:47.550 --> 14:49.609
and billing it
as lunch with a client.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.540
[chuckles]

14:51.650 --> 14:53.049
Well, it's funny

14:53.160 --> 14:56.152
because that may not be
as big a lie as you think.

14:59.090 --> 15:01.593
Ezra...cal|ed Jillian to

15:01.700 --> 15:04.260
try and get me
off the hook and..

15:04.370 --> 15:07.362
...ended up asking for me
to be his co-author.

15:07.470 --> 15:09.938
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.564
I mean, obviously,
I had no idea

15:11.670 --> 15:12.898
that he was gonna do that.

15:13.010 --> 15:14.034
He didn't even

15:14.140 --> 15:15.072
have any idea
he was gonna do that--

15:15.180 --> 15:16.636
Oh, yeah, he did.

15:16.740 --> 15:18.947
It wasn't an accident.
He didn't fall off a bicycle.

15:19.050 --> 15:21.109
He made a decision.

15:23.650 --> 15:24.912
Hey..

15:25.020 --> 15:26.442
...I'm sorry.

15:26.550 --> 15:27.687
This is a great opportunity

15:27.790 --> 15:30.054
and I'm really happy for you.

15:31.290 --> 15:32.587
You're going to be
a published author.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.954
That's amazing.

15:37.730 --> 15:38.697
[door closes]

15:38.800 --> 15:41.030
Is this your way of thanking me?

15:42.770 --> 15:45.466
- Sorry?
- The leak. About Yvonne.

15:45.570 --> 15:48.471
Okay, Caleb and I
had nothing to do with it.

15:50.010 --> 15:52.240
How do I know
that you didn't do it?

15:52.350 --> 15:54.477
I mean, accusing other people
of something that you've done

15:54.580 --> 15:57.515
that does have kind of
a vintage Mona quality about it.

15:57.620 --> 15:59.019
Unbelievable.

15:59.120 --> 16:00.553
I genuinely do something good

16:00.660 --> 16:02.685
and I end up paying for it?

16:02.790 --> 16:04.451
Because of the leak,
the Phillips team

16:04.560 --> 16:07.256
has gone through everything
with a fine-toothed comb.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.158
My gift of your mom's
medical records was discovered.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.693
I've been fired,
my credibility is shot

16:12.800 --> 16:14.995
my future jeopardized,
and now

16:15.100 --> 16:17.261
the one person
who should be kissing my feet

16:17.370 --> 16:20.100
is here accusing me
of screwing her.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.578
Yeah, she's
a powerful character.

16:27.680 --> 16:28.715
Thank you.

16:28.820 --> 16:30.708
Oh, I-I really like,
uh, what you did.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.185
The end of chapter five,
the passage--

16:32.290 --> 16:33.552
Oh, good. Good, good.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.981
Yeah, I-I love this section

16:36.090 --> 16:37.022
here about the bridge.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.188
Do you actually think it works?

16:38.290 --> 16:39.484
I was trying to make it
a metaphor for..

16:39.590 --> 16:40.659
Yeah, no-i-it, it's great.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.069
- I totally got it.
- Great.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.627
Oh, um, I had a few thoughts
this morning.

16:45.730 --> 16:49.689
Let's see this, uh, that
I'd love to talk to you about..

16:49.800 --> 16:52.064
...now. IfI can just find them.

16:55.080 --> 16:57.173
Ezra. .

16:59.350 --> 17:02.069
Why do you want me
to write with you?

17:02.180 --> 17:03.579
I-I mean,
this would be huge for me

17:03.690 --> 17:05.510
and-and it's not that
I don't think my work is good.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.156
Ijust..

17:07.260 --> 17:09.581
I have to ask, cause, you know..

17:09.690 --> 17:11.578
Well, I do.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.058
Well..

17:15.430 --> 17:17.398
Uh..

17:19.670 --> 17:22.696
Nicole's voice was, um..

17:22.800 --> 17:24.336
...taken away.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.038
And I want to give it back.

17:30.850 --> 17:33.717
But I didn't know her.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.414
I know, that's why I need you.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.317
Cause I would spend
the whole time spinning in place

17:38.420 --> 17:40.115
trying to be faithful
to reality and

17:40.220 --> 17:41.710
you're not..

17:41.820 --> 17:44.050
...tied down by that.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.464
I know it's a lot to ask, but..

17:52.870 --> 17:55.191
...could you please
help me with this?

17:57.510 --> 17:58.465
Of course.

17:58.570 --> 18:00.470
[knocking on door]

18:05.650 --> 18:06.776
It's okay.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.108
I've never enjoyed the feeling

18:08.220 --> 18:09.573
of deja vu myself.

18:10.450 --> 18:11.189
Lieutenant.

18:11.290 --> 18:13.315
Would it be possible
for me to speak

18:13.420 --> 18:15.149
with Miss Montgomery alone?

18:15.260 --> 18:16.613
Something wrong?

18:16.720 --> 18:18.654
That's kind of
an open-ended question.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.648
Don't you think?

18:24.830 --> 18:27.139
[intense music]

18:28.340 --> 18:30.228
What are you doing here?

18:30.340 --> 18:33.229
I have an eyewitness
from the Two Crows Diner.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.205
They saw the person
who called the DiLaurentis

18:35.310 --> 18:36.436
on the night
of Charlotte's murder.

18:36.540 --> 18:37.700
Okay, what does that
have to do with me?

18:37.810 --> 18:40.517
Well, maybe nothing.
But you fit the description.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.248
And I'd like it
if you come in for a line up.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.287
I gave you my statement.

18:45.390 --> 18:46.618
I didn't leave
the hotel that night.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.154
And I've never even
been to the Two Crows Diner.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.285
Good. This will give us a chance

18:51.390 --> 18:53.654
to eliminate you as a suspect.

18:59.670 --> 19:01.137
(Linda)
'Come forward, number three.‘

19:01.240 --> 19:03.265
'Please step forward!‘

19:05.310 --> 19:08.279
'Return to the line.'

19:08.380 --> 19:10.200
'Number four, step forward.‘

19:10.310 --> 19:12.301
[intense music]

19:12.410 --> 19:15.447
'Head up, please. Face forward!‘

19:21.260 --> 19:23.387
'Number four,
return to the line.‘

19:26.590 --> 19:28.558
[rock music]

19:30.800 --> 19:33.735
[indistinct chattering]

19:40.540 --> 19:43.179
* Gonna make you sweat

19:43.280 --> 19:45.441
* Gonna make you scream

19:45.550 --> 19:49.577
* Gonna make oh yeah *

19:52.550 --> 19:53.710
Hi..

19:53.820 --> 19:56.186
Um...I was wondering if anyone

19:56.290 --> 19:57.928
recently brought in a dark grey

19:58.030 --> 20:00.590
SUV into the shop?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.362
Uh, maybe someone
looking to get their muffler--

20:03.470 --> 20:05.563
Can't help you.

20:05.670 --> 20:08.332
Okay, does that mean
they haven't or..

20:08.440 --> 20:11.329
It means that I can't help you.

20:14.980 --> 20:18.279
[instrumental music]

20:19.310 --> 20:22.416
[indistinct chattering]

20:36.030 --> 20:38.965
[door opens]

20:39.070 --> 20:41.334
(male #1)
'Thank you for your help.‘

20:44.910 --> 20:47.834
[music continues]

21:00.660 --> 21:01.649
[gaSPSI

21:08.530 --> 21:10.725
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

21:10.830 --> 21:13.936
Um, th-this is the truck
that I was asking about.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.632
Do-do you know
who drove this last night?

21:15.740 --> 21:18.766
Maybe I lent it to a friend.
I can't remember.

21:18.870 --> 21:20.474
Okay, um..

21:20.580 --> 21:22.639
...does this happen
to be your friend?

21:24.810 --> 21:26.744
That's not her.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.584
You need to go.

21:39.060 --> 21:42.826
Thank you. Miss Montgomery,
did you forget something?

21:42.930 --> 21:44.522
Is your eyewitness
Sara Harvey?

21:44.630 --> 21:46.461
_We don't reveal
the identity of Witnesses.

21:46.570 --> 21:48.629
Otherwise people would
be scared to speak up.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.401
Oh, I'm sure
that she couldn't wait.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.966
The person that
you should be questioning

21:52.070 --> 21:53.298
was on your side of the glass!

21:53.410 --> 21:54.308
[phone ringing]

21:54.410 --> 21:55.479
Just a minute.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.309
Yes, Lieutenant Tanner.

21:58.980 --> 22:00.299
'Yeah.'

22:01.120 --> 22:02.974
Gimme that name again.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.014
'I think we had him on lock up,
march of last year.'

22:05.120 --> 22:06.314
- Oh.
- Oh.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.718
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

22:11.660 --> 22:13.594
[sighs]

22:13.700 --> 22:16.624
(Tanner)
'Let me check on his..'

22:16.730 --> 22:19.597
'I believe we picked him up on
a DV, but I'll have to check.‘

22:22.600 --> 22:24.739
'I'll have one of my guys
call you back.‘

22:27.640 --> 22:29.676
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

22:29.780 --> 22:32.999
Now. Would you like to fill out
the complaint form?

22:33.110 --> 22:34.748
A complaint form?

22:34.850 --> 22:37.819
Five years ago
you found me, underground..

22:39.890 --> 22:41.619
I would just think that
after everything that's happened

22:41.720 --> 22:43.017
you would take
what I say seriously.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.428
I do.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.748
I take every
accusation seriously.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.624
'Doesn't mean I act on it
right away.'

22:49.730 --> 22:52.563
And it's because of that,
you are free to go.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.908
[indistinct chattering]

23:08.220 --> 23:09.471
I don't get it.

23:09.580 --> 23:10.581
If Sara was framing us

23:10.690 --> 23:12.578
then why were you free to go?

23:12.690 --> 23:13.918
Maybe that's what
Tanner meant when she said

23:14.020 --> 23:14.918
the police don't always act

23:15.020 --> 23:16.851
on every accusation right away.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.383
So all we can do is
wait for the other shoe to drop?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.667
Hanna? You can't
neglect your other guests.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.091
Why don't you lead
the group in some icebreakers?

23:26.200 --> 23:28.634
Sure.
As soon as Spencer gets here.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.799
Well, where is she?

23:38.080 --> 23:40.947
Nice to see how much you take
our little chats to heart.

23:42.680 --> 23:43.681
What?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.945
Yeah, less then 24 hours
after my request..

23:47.050 --> 23:48.085
...Caleb's in the house.

23:48.190 --> 23:50.556
Dad, he had to get some clothes.
And how did you eve--

23:50.660 --> 23:52.685
Then a park bench?

23:52.790 --> 23:54.690
Right?

23:56.530 --> 23:57.724
You cannot just ask me

23:57.830 --> 24:01.129
to cut this person
out of my life.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.504
Do I look like I'm asking?

24:07.070 --> 24:08.037
[sighs]

24:08.140 --> 24:09.698
Spence, listen..

24:09.810 --> 24:12.699
...I, I know
how painful this is.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.843
And maybe Caleb had
good intentions

24:15.950 --> 24:17.747
but his actions prove
that he doesn't share

24:17.850 --> 24:19.841
the same value system
as this family.

24:19.950 --> 24:22.089
Oh, my God!

24:22.190 --> 24:26.149
Can you really look at me and
say that with a straight face?

24:26.260 --> 24:27.921
You are protecting her!

24:28.030 --> 24:30.863
She kills someone and you
shuttle her off to Europe?

24:30.970 --> 24:32.699
What kind of value system
is that?

24:32.800 --> 24:35.564
She didn't kill anyone.
She was being blackmailed.

24:37.270 --> 24:39.602
What are you talking about?

24:43.750 --> 24:45.900
Right before
Charlotte's hearing..

24:46.010 --> 24:48.979
...your sister started
getting threatening messages.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.741
Someone claimed
to have her on tape

24:50.850 --> 24:53.148
confessing to burying Bethany.

24:53.250 --> 24:54.182
That can't be true, dad.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.257
She was told

24:55.360 --> 24:56.486
to drop money off

24:56.590 --> 24:58.023
at a disclosed location..

24:58.130 --> 25:00.655
...or the video
would be released.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.648
That's why she came back
to Rosewood in secret.

25:02.760 --> 25:03.988
Who was blackmailing her?

25:04.100 --> 25:05.067
She doesn't know.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.592
But she dropped off the money

25:06.700 --> 25:08.531
and just hoped
everything would go away.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.699
Then Charlotte turned up dead.

25:12.040 --> 25:15.009
O-okay, so then why flee?

25:15.110 --> 25:16.668
You said that she had
nothing to do with it.

25:16.780 --> 25:18.577
She got spooked, Spence.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.773
Why didn't you tell her
to go to the police?

25:22.120 --> 25:24.179
I was scared.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.882
Okay, I was scared that,
like you

25:25.990 --> 25:28.857
they would think she was
guilty of more than just being..

25:28.960 --> 25:30.825
Blackmailed?
Do we really believe that?

25:30.930 --> 25:33.251
Well, even if it is true,
isn't that more of a reason

25:33.360 --> 25:34.759
Melissa would have
wanted Charlotte dead?

25:34.860 --> 25:35.929
Yeah, but Charlotte
was still on lockdown

25:36.030 --> 25:37.258
when Melissa
made her first payment.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.292
So what are you saying?

25:38.400 --> 25:39.628
The person who's threatening us

25:39.730 --> 25:40.662
is probably the same person

25:40.770 --> 25:41.759
who was blackmailing my sister.

25:41.870 --> 25:42.939
Well I don't think
it was Melissa

25:43.040 --> 25:44.064
who borrowed that SUV.

25:45.070 --> 25:46.037
I looked at the pictures,
one look at that crowd

25:46.940 --> 25:48.032
and her Argyle socks
would have blown off.

25:48.140 --> 25:49.630
Which leaves us with nothing.

25:49.740 --> 25:50.946
No, there's
the eyewitness report.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.245
A hot brunette
with a cheesy keychain?

25:53.350 --> 25:54.544
That's, like, half this party.

25:54.650 --> 25:56.641
[glass clicking]

25:57.750 --> 25:59.081
Ladies, if you could all
move to the sofa.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.715
Uh, sweetie, I thought you could
open your presents now.

26:02.820 --> 26:05.550
If any of you guys
got me some kind of toy

26:05.660 --> 26:07.548
you're dead.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.127
[knocking on door]

26:16.270 --> 26:19.103
Congratulations, Han.

26:19.210 --> 26:21.337
I just wanted to drop that off.

26:21.440 --> 26:23.601
'I figured you'd
get a kick out of it.'

26:23.710 --> 26:24.779
[chuckles]

26:24.880 --> 26:26.700
Remember the summer
before eighth grade?

26:26.810 --> 26:28.573
We were all set
to have double weddings.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.238
'I was going to
marry Justin Timberlake'

26:30.350 --> 26:33.581
and...you were going to
tie the knot with Matt Damon.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.314
Wow.

26:35.420 --> 26:36.910
I can't believe
you still have this.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.083
That's so thoughtful
of you, Mona.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.722
Why don't you come in
for a drink?

26:44.830 --> 26:46.821
'Hanna was just about
to open more gifts.‘

26:49.400 --> 26:52.164
I don't want to intrude,
but. . .sure.

26:58.210 --> 27:02.010
Okay, uh, it's time
for 21 Questions.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.178
Uh, this version is

27:04.190 --> 27:05.714
"How Well Do You Know
the Bride and Groom?"

27:06.750 --> 27:08.354
So, whoever gets the
most points, wins a prize.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.281
So, first question,
for 100 points..

27:11.390 --> 27:13.654
Where did Jordan propose?

27:15.760 --> 27:16.988
Why is she here?

27:17.100 --> 27:18.795
I thought you two
had it out at The Brew.

27:18.900 --> 27:20.299
Hm, she brought a gift.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.664
Yeah, and an ax to grind.

27:23.770 --> 27:26.307
(Ashley)
Emily, for 50 points.

27:26.410 --> 27:28.002
Do you know this one? Uh..

27:28.110 --> 27:30.237
"How did the bride
and groom meet?"

27:30.340 --> 27:31.898
Yeah, um..

27:32.010 --> 27:34.240
'I, uh, I think it
was at a work function.‘

27:35.780 --> 27:39.238
No, no, it was, um,
it was at-at a party.

27:40.760 --> 27:42.682
Sorry. Uh, Spencer?

27:43.320 --> 27:45.185
Um..

27:45.290 --> 27:46.257
Mm..

27:46.360 --> 27:49.898
Wait, I know this. Uh..

27:50.000 --> 27:52.867
Um, you know what,
this game is kind of silly.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.264
Um, isn't there one where

27:56.370 --> 27:58.668
everyone takes a shot
when you hear the word bride?

27:58.770 --> 28:01.079
[all laugh]

28:01.180 --> 28:02.431

28:02.540 --> 28:04.076

28:12.490 --> 28:14.958
- Hanna!
- I don't know how to stop it.

28:15.060 --> 28:16.118
Here, here.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.219
What is happening?

28:21.330 --> 28:22.922
I have no idea.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.238

28:28.340 --> 28:30.228

- 'What is that?‘

'Somebody turn it off!‘

28:40.080 --> 28:41.775
- Aria!
- Oh, my God!

28:44.550 --> 28:46.245
[indistinct chattering]

28:47.490 --> 28:49.958
(Spencer)
Okay. Yeah, just give me a call.

28:51.990 --> 28:54.026
Well, she's just been
admitted into the ER.

28:54.130 --> 28:55.791
I mean, she has
second-degree burns

28:55.900 --> 28:57.390
but the doctors say
that she's gonna be fine.

28:57.500 --> 28:58.819
[exhales]

28:58.930 --> 29:00.158
How did this even happen?

29:00.270 --> 29:02.135
Why don't you ask her?

29:03.170 --> 29:04.501
I mean, is it just
a coincidence

29:04.610 --> 29:05.838
that the loft _tried
to turn Aria

29:05.940 --> 29:06.861
into a s'more right

29:06.970 --> 29:08.198
after she arrived?

29:09.410 --> 29:11.844
[cell phone beeps]

29:11.950 --> 29:14.009
[dramatic music]

29:22.990 --> 29:24.355
How long does this take?

29:26.060 --> 29:28.756
Three minutes.
Said on the package.

29:38.470 --> 29:40.199
Um...I have to go.

29:40.310 --> 29:41.299
Who's was that? Hannah?

29:41.410 --> 29:42.331
No, it was, uh

29:42.440 --> 29:43.771
it-it was my dad.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.142
Uh, but I'll call you later.

29:45.250 --> 29:46.899
Bye.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.176
[music continues]

30:26.890 --> 30:28.881
Do you wanna talk about it?

30:30.590 --> 30:32.023
Talk about what?

30:33.360 --> 30:36.818
What we're gonna do if--

30:36.930 --> 30:39.922
Toby, I'm a sophomore...okay?

30:40.030 --> 30:42.191
I'm having a hard enough time
juggling exams.

30:43.440 --> 30:45.032
I know.

30:45.140 --> 30:46.937
And you don't even live
in this state.

30:47.040 --> 30:49.600
I-I know, but I..

30:49.710 --> 30:52.349
...could apply for a transfer.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.374
And what? You gonna move
into my dorm room?

30:55.480 --> 30:57.983
You don't have to..

30:58.090 --> 30:59.284
...say it like that.

31:00.190 --> 31:01.054
Like what?

31:01.160 --> 31:03.378
Like...|iving together

31:03.490 --> 31:05.355
would be such a horrible thing.

31:05.460 --> 31:07.951
In this context it would be.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.925
I'm sorry, but it would.

31:11.330 --> 31:12.399
YouTe”

31:12.500 --> 31:13.569
...talking about this like

31:13.670 --> 31:14.967
it would..

31:17.040 --> 31:19.201
...ruin our lives.

31:19.310 --> 31:22.006
I mean, isn't this
what we are planning for..

31:22.110 --> 31:23.407
...eventually?

31:23.510 --> 31:24.602
I-I don't know.

31:24.710 --> 31:26.905
You know, I really..

31:28.350 --> 31:30.568
I hadn't really thought
that far ahead.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.443
I haven't even
made up my mind yet

31:32.550 --> 31:35.087
about grad school, I don't..

31:35.190 --> 31:37.408
Well, have you, have you
made up your mind about me?

31:39.230 --> 31:42.654
Don't make this about something
that it isn't.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.625
[instrumental music]

31:44.730 --> 31:48.166
And what about you? I'm not the
only person here who has plans.

31:48.270 --> 31:49.498
You know, you were,
you said that you

31:49.600 --> 31:51.431

and you said that wanted

31:51.540 --> 31:52.438
to go back to school.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.098
That was your idea, not mine.

31:54.210 --> 31:55.609
And it was only because being
with a cop

31:55.710 --> 31:56.677
isn't good enough for you.

31:56.780 --> 32:00.170
I have never said that, okay?

32:00.280 --> 32:02.316
I just, I don't know, I thought
that maybe you wanted--

32:02.420 --> 32:03.341
More?

32:07.090 --> 32:11.026
Can we please
not do this right now?

If you're, if you're gonna try
and get me--

33:30.500 --> 33:32.536
He didn't do it.

33:32.640 --> 33:34.130
Okay? He didn't leak it.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.003
He's just taking the blame.

33:38.380 --> 33:39.472
Why?

33:42.220 --> 33:44.085
Because "A" is back.

33:44.190 --> 33:48.388
Not "A" exactly, just, uh,
some copycat version

33:50.590 --> 33:52.126
What?

Whoever this is, thinks that
we know who killed Charlotte

and so they're trying
to make our lives miserable

33:55.900 --> 33:57.219

33:57.330 --> 33:59.025
And I'm really sorry,
but Yvonne

33:59.130 --> 34:01.291
was just collateral damage.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.492
And Caleb didn't wanna tell you

could, I could take you home.

they're my clothes

we can find some medical tape

who hasn't been including

Why have you iced out Mona?

and your friends

reacted when she showed up.

a warmer welcome.

Well, she wasn't invited.

Why not?

a great deal to her.

Has something happened
since the investigation started?

Honestly, I don't know
what Mona's been up to lately.
