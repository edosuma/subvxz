Clock him close.

01:16.142 --> 01:18.263
<i>He's not going anywhere.</i>

01:23.517 --> 01:26.266
I'm hand-carrying this thing
right into the museum.

01:26.392 --> 01:28.632
Stan, you've got more cover on you than the president.

01:28.768 --> 01:30.142
The diamond is safe.

01:30.268 --> 01:34.842
This is an armed caravan, completely bulletproof, magnetic locks.

01:34.976 --> 01:37.263

Okay, thank you.

There you go.

Every time!

03:03.398 --> 03:04.641
Charge? Charge!

03:04.773 --> 03:06.048
Ref, listen!

03:06.075 --> 03:07.880
This is insane!

It's a foul on him.

03:09.315 --> 03:11.270
Charge? I'll show you a charge!

03:11.398 --> 03:14.100
I'll show you a damn charge, man!

03:14.231 --> 03:16.388
That's the worst call I ever seen!

03:16.523 --> 03:18.265
What do you think this is, a rodeo?

03:18.398 --> 03:19.726
Then I'll be the clown!

03:19.857 --> 03:21.231
- Let me in the game!
- Sit down, please.

03:21.357 --> 03:23.348
Get out of my way!
Play some real ball!

03:45.441 --> 03:46.721
Shit! He's gone.

03:47.442 --> 03:48.603
We've lost him.

03:48.733 --> 03:49.764
What?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.855
- Burdett is gone.
- <i>Find him.</i>

03:53.609 --> 03:55.315
He's coming after it.

03:55.442 --> 03:57.184
We're fine.
Just relax.

03:57.317 --> 03:59.225
Don't tell me to relax.

03:59.359 --> 04:01.645
I've dealt with this guy before.

04:14.360 --> 04:15.604
See him yet?

04:17.235 --> 04:19.107
We're looking, we're looking.

04:20.777 --> 04:22.933
Safeties off until they relocate Burdett.

04:23.777 --> 04:26.561
<i>Oh, kiss me</i>

04:26.694 --> 04:28.021
Stand down.
We got him.

04:28.152 --> 04:30.059
He's still here.

04:30.194 --> 04:31.473
On the Jumbotron.

04:31.611 --> 04:32.808
He changed his seat.

04:35.903 --> 04:37.479
Get a direct visual.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.600
You got it.

04:59.987 --> 05:01.777
See, Stan, we got you here.

05:01.904 --> 05:03.694
No need to panic.

05:13.321 --> 05:15.146
Do you have a direct visual yet?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.270
<i>Negative. We're still looking.</i>

05:23.947 --> 05:25.487

Good luck.

07:42.954 --> 07:44.135
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Your beard tickles.

07:49.996 --> 07:51.110

07:51.246 --> 07:53.652

Huh, huh, huh?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.303
Man, do I love lobster!

13:14.430 --> 13:16.717
So, I'm setting up for this 30-foot putt,

13:16.847 --> 13:18.423
I got a chance for an eagle.

13:18.555 --> 13:19.752
An eagle. Now, sweetie...

13:19.889 --> 13:21.879
Steal her bracelet.

13:22.014 --> 13:23.590
I saw you looking at it.

13:23.722 --> 13:24.752
Steal it.

13:24.889 --> 13:26.003
You know you want it.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.490
We're retired, baby.

13:27.517 --> 13:28.867
All I want is you.

13:28.973 --> 13:32.255
Come on, let yourself go.
Have fun.

13:32.389 --> 13:33.763
I bet you can't get it.

13:33.889 --> 13:36.259
Of course I can, but I won't.

13:37.348 --> 13:38.378
Bet you can't.

13:38.515 --> 13:41.797
Max. Aren't you having a good time?

13:42.432 --> 13:43.510
Please come again.

13:43.640 --> 13:46.591
Maxwell, this one's on me.

13:46.723 --> 13:48.880
Oh, thank you very much.

13:51.599 --> 13:52.825
That's weird, I can't find my wallet.

13:52.852 --> 13:53.746
Did I give you my wallet?

13:53.849 --> 13:54.844
No, you didn't give me your wallet.

13:54.974 --> 13:57.723
That's so weird! I could swear I put it in my pocket before I came here.

13:57.849 --> 14:00.089
It's okay, big fellow.
I got it.

14:00.224 --> 14:01.717
Oh, thanks, Maxwell.

14:01.849 --> 14:03.176
That is so sweet.

14:03.308 --> 14:05.843
Where the hell is my wallet?

14:10.016 --> 14:12.505
Luc, what's in the Caribbean Romance again?

14:12.641 --> 14:14.051
Light rum, amaretto,

14:14.183 --> 14:17.300
orange juice, pineapple juice, and a splash of grenadine.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.266
What about the Pink Paradise?

14:20.392 --> 14:24.682
Coconut rum, amaretto, cranberry juice, orange juice, and pineapple juice.

14:26.517 --> 14:27.927
People actually drink this stuff?

14:28.059 --> 14:30.974
They love it.
You know, it makes them feel exotic.

14:31.101 --> 14:32.558
Give me a Jack on the rocks.

14:32.684 --> 14:35.220
It doesn't have a fancy name, but if it was good enough for Frank,

14:35.351 --> 14:36.678
it's good enough for me.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.219
Frank?

14:38.351 --> 14:39.809
Who's Frank?

14:39.935 --> 14:41.427
Sinatra.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.385
Did Frank take an umbrella?

14:44.268 --> 14:46.223
Not even when it was raining.

14:50.394 --> 14:51.803
Hi, baby.

14:57.227 --> 14:58.389
How was it?

14:58.519 --> 15:00.426
Amazing! You'd love it!

15:00.561 --> 15:03.642
The only sounds are your breath and your heartbeat.

15:03.769 --> 15:08.391
The reef is like a thousand jewels, sparkling right in front of you.

15:08.519 --> 15:10.594
You should really try it next time.

15:10.728 --> 15:13.181
Mm-hmm. Well, I like to breathe unassisted.

15:13.311 --> 15:14.934
- Oh, really?
- Mmm.

15:15.061 --> 15:17.846
I thought you liked it when I give you mouth to mouth.

16:51.900 --> 16:53.097
State your business.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.057
You're gonna shoot an FBI agent, Burdett?

16:56.192 --> 16:58.183
All I see is an intruder...

16:59.234 --> 17:01.639
...who just swallowed $80 worth of my whiskey.

17:04.192 --> 17:05.602
Put down the weapon.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.143
Don't make me shoot you again.

17:07.901 --> 17:08.896
Again?

17:09.026 --> 17:10.768
Is that the way we're gonna play it?

17:15.401 --> 17:17.641
What are you doing in my house, Agent Lloyd?

17:17.776 --> 17:20.608
Sitting, drinking, eating chocolate.

17:20.734 --> 17:21.643
You have a warrant?

17:21.670 --> 17:23.628
FBI doesn't have jurisdiction here.

17:23.734 --> 17:25.192
I know, that's why I came down here.

17:25.318 --> 17:26.810
Oh, I don't think it is.

17:26.943 --> 17:30.107
The <i>Seven Seas Navigator</i> docking here for a solid week.

17:30.235 --> 17:33.103
They're having a nice promotion for the maiden voyage,

17:33.235 --> 17:35.938
calling it the Diamond Cruise.

17:36.069 --> 17:39.020
A gem exhibit whose star attraction is

17:39.152 --> 17:41.227
the third Napoleon Diamond.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.684
Stop me when I get to the part you don't know.

17:43.819 --> 17:46.024
It's the only one you two haven't stolen.

17:46.153 --> 17:47.148
Allegedly.

17:47.278 --> 17:49.849
And it's gonna be right here for a whole week-- the last of the set--

17:49.986 --> 17:52.273
and I suspect you plan to purloin it.

17:52.403 --> 17:53.433
Well, I don't.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.360
So finish your drink and get out.

17:55.487 --> 17:56.944
It's okay to be happy to see me.

17:57.070 --> 18:00.152
Just because you're English doesn't mean you need to hide your emotions.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.234
I'm Irish.
We let people know how we feel.

18:02.362 --> 18:03.689
Now fuck off.

18:06.612 --> 18:09.279
And you can take any bugs you planted along with you.

18:09.446 --> 18:10.939
I'm retired.

18:11.071 --> 18:14.104
A retired guy wouldn't have anything to worry about from those.

18:14.238 --> 18:15.647
- Mind if I borrow this?
- Take it.

18:15.779 --> 18:17.320
You might learn something from it.

18:17.446 --> 18:19.153
But return it for me.
It's overdue.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.986
Give my love to Lola, will you?

18:32.572 --> 18:34.065
How was the tennis lesson?

18:34.197 --> 18:37.030
Great. The teacher says I'm a natural.

18:37.156 --> 18:39.905
He says I've got the best backside he's ever seen.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.026
That's <i>backhand</i>.

18:41.156 --> 18:42.234
Don't go in there.

18:42.364 --> 18:44.485
- Why?
- Let's talk.

18:45.698 --> 18:49.194
Okay, you're making me nervous, and I don't get nervous.

18:50.948 --> 18:52.773
Agent Lloyd just left.

18:52.906 --> 18:54.529
What's <i>he</i> doing here?

18:54.656 --> 18:56.114
He came to show me this.

19:02.282 --> 19:04.568
Damn it, Max.

19:04.699 --> 19:06.156
Is this what we're here for?

19:06.282 --> 19:08.735
No. It's not.

19:11.241 --> 19:13.278
This is not retirement at all.

19:13.407 --> 19:15.777
This is the next setup, isn't it?

19:15.908 --> 19:18.822
Babe, <i>you</i> chose this island, remember?

19:21.033 --> 19:23.522
I hope you don't think this is a gift from God.

19:23.658 --> 19:27.189
'Cause this is God messing with us.

19:32.033 --> 19:34.024
Oh, no. Max.

19:34.950 --> 19:36.609
Did Stan do this?

19:36.742 --> 19:38.484
Sort of.

19:39.576 --> 19:42.111
I figured he'd bug the place, so I started checking.

19:42.242 --> 19:44.114
Did you find any?

19:44.242 --> 19:46.447
Only what he wanted me to find.

19:47.493 --> 19:49.116
There's another one here somewhere.

19:51.576 --> 19:53.117
Now, don't worry.
I already checked.

19:53.243 --> 19:54.404
There's nothing in there.

19:54.535 --> 19:55.992
That's the problem.

19:56.118 --> 19:57.694
There's nothing in here.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.903
What is it?
What's wrong?

20:04.035 --> 20:06.571
I hid the bullet in the camera.

20:06.702 --> 20:08.278
What bullet?

20:08.410 --> 20:10.567
The one he shot you with.

20:10.702 --> 20:12.195
Oh, no.

20:13.452 --> 20:16.783
I kept it to remind me of how close I came to losing you.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.364
Lola, you know that bullet puts me on the scene.

20:19.494 --> 20:22.161
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

20:22.286 --> 20:24.241
I'll get it back.

20:39.912 --> 20:42.483
Good morning, Mr. Lloyd. Your suite is ready.

20:42.621 --> 20:44.860
- Suite?
- Suite, sir.

20:44.996 --> 20:46.868
It's a larger room.

20:48.329 --> 20:52.572
Atlantis reserves this bridge suite for our more dignified guests.

20:55.871 --> 20:58.953
Breakfast is on the house, these are vouchers for free tennis lessons,

20:59.080 --> 21:02.944
complimentary skin exfoliant, seaweed body wrap and facial scrub,

21:03.080 --> 21:05.651
located in the spa on the club level.

21:05.788 --> 21:07.162
Also, please remember.

21:07.289 --> 21:12.029
Shoes and shirt are required in all public spaces at all times.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.160
State your business.

21:45.291 --> 21:48.289
You can't bribe me with a seaweed body wrap, Max.

21:48.416 --> 21:49.992
This doesn't buy you one bit of space.

21:50.124 --> 21:52.162
I'm gonna be on you wherever you go.

21:52.291 --> 21:53.369
It's no bribe, Stanley.

21:53.499 --> 21:55.822
I just want you to see that if you lead the kind of life I do,

21:55.958 --> 21:58.079
stealing is the last thing on your mind.

22:00.541 --> 22:01.999
Mr. Lloyd.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.116
Are you ready for your massage?

22:05.500 --> 22:07.290
I'll do your back.

22:07.417 --> 22:09.242
I'll do your front.

22:10.500 --> 22:11.910
You son of a bitch.

22:21.918 --> 22:23.576
- Lola?
- Yeah.

22:25.126 --> 22:28.124
- He hid it in a black jewelry box.
- Good job.

22:28.251 --> 22:29.495
Thank you.

22:29.626 --> 22:31.451
Talented masseuse.

22:32.335 --> 22:33.448
You get rid of it this time.

22:33.585 --> 22:35.042
I will.

22:35.918 --> 22:37.790
Good evening.
May I take your order?

22:39.835 --> 22:40.532
No, thank you.

22:40.559 --> 22:41.852
I just lost my appetite.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.122
Just as well.

22:43.252 --> 22:46.001
I don't take orders from criminals, I arrest them.

22:46.127 --> 22:47.620
Or fall asleep trying.

22:48.252 --> 22:49.875
So you're admitting you were there.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.917
No. I read about it in the papers, just like everyone else.

22:53.044 --> 22:54.952
You're famous.

22:55.919 --> 22:57.329
I'm a punchline.

22:58.003 --> 23:02.079
But like my grandma used to say, he who laughs last laughs loudest.

23:02.211 --> 23:03.918
By the way, return that movie, would you?

23:04.045 --> 23:05.585
The store called.

23:05.712 --> 23:07.370
I haven't finished it yet.

23:07.503 --> 23:10.585
They catch the thief, but it's not who you think it is.

23:10.712 --> 23:12.619
I don't like those twist endings.

23:12.754 --> 23:14.128
Well, we don't like you.

23:14.254 --> 23:16.956
- Aw.
- Lola.

23:18.629 --> 23:20.122
They're playing your song.

23:20.254 --> 23:23.169
Why don't you take Stanley for a dance?

23:23.296 --> 23:24.836
He's feeling lonely.

23:24.963 --> 23:27.533
And I am feeling charitable.

23:28.379 --> 23:29.872
Let's go, Stan.

23:30.004 --> 23:31.083
Really?

23:32.671 --> 23:34.709
I'll try to have her back by dawn.

23:49.297 --> 23:50.459
Constable...

23:52.422 --> 23:53.702
Can I help you?

23:53.839 --> 23:55.629
I wanna talk to Mooré.

23:55.756 --> 23:57.000
Get out of the way.

23:57.131 --> 23:59.915
Monsieur Mooré is currently socializing.

24:00.048 --> 24:02.916
Interrupting a man's leisure is harassment.

24:03.048 --> 24:05.334
That's not harassment.

24:06.756 --> 24:08.000
You feel that?

24:08.131 --> 24:10.336
- Ooh.
- That's harassment.

24:10.465 --> 24:14.541
And you tell your boss this is just the beginning.

24:14.674 --> 24:17.921
I have two hands, and I can't be bought.

24:18.049 --> 24:19.044
Ooh.

24:23.007 --> 24:24.142
Excuse me, constable.

24:24.169 --> 24:25.736
May I have a word with you?

24:34.550 --> 24:38.129
<i>Audrey, where you get that sugar?</i>

24:38.258 --> 24:40.296
Listen, Stan, I know what you're doing.

24:40.425 --> 24:44.419
But if you drag Max into your game, he will not lose.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.541
Eventually, they all lose.

24:46.675 --> 24:48.216
Not my Max.

24:48.342 --> 24:50.712
Do yourself a favor--
leave us alone.

24:50.842 --> 24:54.753
We're just a couple of retirees trying to enjoy the island life.

24:54.884 --> 24:58.297
All the same, I'll stick around, see what develops.

24:59.843 --> 25:01.004
Excuse me.

25:01.134 --> 25:01.835
In a second, honey.

25:01.862 --> 25:02.783
You'll get your chance.

25:02.884 --> 25:05.634
Damn, I got the stink on me tonight.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.418
Step off the dance floor, sir.

25:08.260 --> 25:09.669
Hey!

25:09.801 --> 25:11.460
- Have fun, Stan.
- Hey. Lola!

25:11.593 --> 25:14.129
Police.
Raise your hands, sir.

25:15.260 --> 25:17.879
I'm law.
Federal B.I.?

25:24.677 --> 25:28.801
It is illegal on this island to carry a concealed weapon without a permit.

25:28.927 --> 25:30.550
I'm working a suspect.

25:33.636 --> 25:36.303
Are you not supposed to inform local authorities when you arrive,

25:36.428 --> 25:38.881
Agent Stanley P. Lloyd?

25:42.220 --> 25:44.341
- You know him?
- He's my suspect.

25:44.470 --> 25:47.503
Well, we're still gonna have to take this to the station and register it.

25:47.637 --> 25:48.964
You're letting the criminal go.

25:49.095 --> 25:50.257
This is crazy.

25:50.387 --> 25:51.880
You think this is crazy?

25:52.012 --> 25:54.761
Your dancing, <i>that</i> was crazy.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.380
This way, Agent Lloyd.

25:56.512 --> 25:58.420
Welcome to paradise.

26:03.429 --> 26:04.673
Okay.

26:04.804 --> 26:07.672
- The watermarks and holograms match.
- Oh.

26:07.805 --> 26:09.842
But I still have to register the gun.

26:15.638 --> 26:17.179
You have a nice smile.

26:17.305 --> 26:19.047
I haven't smiled at you.

26:19.180 --> 26:20.721
You will.

26:23.305 --> 26:25.711
That's just the way I feel about it, and they have to deal with it.

26:25.847 --> 26:26.961
Yes, sir.

26:27.097 --> 26:28.922
Ah, Sophie.

26:29.056 --> 26:30.845
I need to speak to you.

26:30.972 --> 26:33.508
I'm getting complaints about you bothering Henri Mooré.

26:33.639 --> 26:35.547
Just doing my job, Zacharias.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.672
The man is practically the unofficial mayor of the island.

26:37.806 --> 26:39.382
In one year, he's made everyone here like him,

26:39.515 --> 26:41.304
something you haven't been able to do in a lifetime.

26:41.431 --> 26:44.134
I guess we can't all be the kiss-ass politician you are.

26:44.973 --> 26:47.841
I want you to stay behind tonight so we can discuss your attitude.

26:47.973 --> 26:49.549
You knew about my attitude the day we got married

26:49.682 --> 26:51.139
and knew about it the day we got divorced.

26:51.265 --> 26:54.014
You're not gonna learn any more about it tonight.

26:54.140 --> 26:58.004
Besides, I have plans with Special Agent Lloyd of the FBI.

26:58.141 --> 27:00.131
He's just arrived on the island.

27:00.849 --> 27:01.963
Is that so?

27:02.891 --> 27:03.886
Shall we?

27:04.016 --> 27:05.592
We shall.

27:10.433 --> 27:12.091
She's feisty.

27:17.267 --> 27:20.679
Mmm. Isn't it beautiful?

27:22.100 --> 27:23.214
Yeah.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.140
Is it enough?

27:27.934 --> 27:29.095
Of course it is.

27:42.018 --> 27:45.300
Some people say the only way to rid yourself of temptation

27:45.435 --> 27:47.509
is to yield to it.

27:49.727 --> 27:51.385
I don't know about that.

27:53.518 --> 27:58.472
I say turn your back on temptation...

27:59.310 --> 28:04.513
...or substitute something more tempting.

28:18.811 --> 28:21.098
See how easy that was?

28:30.354 --> 28:32.724
What's the shortest amount of time you've ever known a guy

28:32.854 --> 28:36.302
before you kissed him?

28:36.979 --> 28:39.728
I see what you're thinking, and you can forget it.

28:39.854 --> 28:43.683
Guys come down to this island looking for a slice of paradise with a local girl,

28:43.813 --> 28:46.053
and they will say anything to get it.

28:47.230 --> 28:49.801
I resent being lumped in with all guys,

28:49.938 --> 28:53.102
though, admittedly, I would say anything right now.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.434
How long have you been chasing Max?

28:57.522 --> 29:01.432
Seven years-- ever since the first Napoleon Diamond went missing.

29:01.564 --> 29:04.562
I got to the scene, took a few shots at the getaway car.

29:04.689 --> 29:09.311
Next day, bottle of champagne arrives at FBI Headquarters for me,

29:09.439 --> 29:14.144
with a note says, "Aim for the tires next time."

29:14.273 --> 29:15.896
He was baiting you.

29:16.023 --> 29:18.891
- Hmm.
- Is there a money trail?

29:19.023 --> 29:21.974
Everything's plain-- taxes, bank accounts.

29:22.107 --> 29:25.270
He doesn't buy expensive paintings, yachts, nothing.

29:25.398 --> 29:30.388
I think it's more about the challenge and the alibi-- that's his work of art.

29:30.524 --> 29:32.265
Sounds like you admire him.

29:33.315 --> 29:36.847
Would I like to live one day in his velvety slippers?

29:36.982 --> 29:38.356
Maybe.

29:38.482 --> 29:40.307
But I don't admire him.

29:40.441 --> 29:42.396
He's beat me too many times for that.

29:42.524 --> 29:44.645
Maybe you need the female touch.

29:46.274 --> 29:48.230
That's exactly what I need.

29:48.358 --> 29:51.806
Listen, I want a big arrest, you need local help.

29:51.941 --> 29:54.228
I'll extend the FBI courtesy on this one.

29:54.358 --> 29:56.645
As long as I'm riding shotgun.

30:04.442 --> 30:05.604
What's going on?

30:05.734 --> 30:07.771
I'm expanding the deck.

30:07.901 --> 30:09.477
You're trying to stay busy.

30:09.609 --> 30:12.726
Look, on this deck, we are going to sit here

30:12.859 --> 30:15.774
and watch sunsets until we get old.

30:16.609 --> 30:18.150
Can't wait.

30:18.276 --> 30:19.686
Where are you going?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.441
You said I need a hobby.

30:21.568 --> 30:23.475
I guess I'll go find one.

30:23.610 --> 30:24.605
Really?

30:24.735 --> 30:26.726
I'll call you later.

<font color=orange>© P@rM!NdeR M@nkÖÖ ™

30:57.278 --> 30:58.309
He's here.

31:05.987 --> 31:08.108
The centerpiece of our exhibit.

31:08.237 --> 31:11.603
Napoleon had three priceless diamonds set into the hilt of his sword.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.819
After his defeat, they were pried out and dispersed around the globe.

31:14.946 --> 31:18.810
This is one of the rare occasions the last
remaining diamond is on public display.

31:18.946 --> 31:21.517
And next, we have some rare Egyptian gems.

31:50.239 --> 31:51.816
Cute little rock.

31:51.948 --> 31:53.606
I'm just here to look.

31:53.740 --> 31:54.818
Just as well.

31:54.948 --> 31:58.195
With six cameras-- four stationary, two revolving,

31:58.323 --> 31:59.982
a dozen I.R. motion sensors--

32:00.115 --> 32:02.734
Sixteen.
You missed the ones at ankle level.

32:02.865 --> 32:05.270
Plus your standard 24-hour rotating guards.

32:05.407 --> 32:07.860
Unbreakable polycarbonate display,

32:07.990 --> 32:10.739
controlled by an uncopyable magnetic key card.

32:12.657 --> 32:16.698
I just realized--
you could never get it anyway.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.396
You're right.

32:22.616 --> 32:24.441
When you're right, you're right.

32:25.241 --> 32:26.520
It's impossible.

33:12.952 --> 33:14.279
Give me a ride.

33:14.411 --> 33:15.524
I don't think so.

33:15.661 --> 33:17.782
Maybe you should think again.

33:43.412 --> 33:47.453
May I present Monsieur Henri Mooré.

33:48.121 --> 33:49.448
Mr. Burdett.

33:50.121 --> 33:51.661
It is a pleasure to meet you, sir.

33:51.788 --> 33:53.613
Oh, you're an American.

33:53.746 --> 33:56.235
Hmm. Henri Mooré?

33:56.371 --> 33:58.278
Ah. My name is Henry Moore.

33:58.413 --> 34:00.818
I placed the thing on the "e".

34:00.955 --> 34:02.910
I felt it more appropriate to my surroundings.

34:03.038 --> 34:04.910
- Oh.
- Please.

34:09.496 --> 34:10.989
I imagine you're wondering why you're here.

34:11.121 --> 34:12.994
Well...

34:13.121 --> 34:15.445
Forgive Jean-Paul's tactics, Mr. Burdett,

34:15.580 --> 34:20.036
but to put it bluntly, the impoverished people of this island need your help.

34:20.164 --> 34:21.572
Hmm.

34:21.706 --> 34:24.621
Five years ago, I was a successful businessman in Detroit.

34:24.748 --> 34:26.822
While vacationing on this island,

34:26.956 --> 34:28.994
I was sitting on the beach drinking a...

34:29.123 --> 34:30.913
Citron martini.

34:33.956 --> 34:34.777
I don't recall what I was

34:34.804 --> 34:35.853
drinking-- it's not important.

34:35.956 --> 34:37.697
But I experienced a revelation--

34:37.831 --> 34:41.871
that I had been brought to this island to provide the commensurate social services

34:41.998 --> 34:45.161
that were sadly lacking for the poorer elements of society here.

34:45.331 --> 34:48.199
And you want me to buy a table at your next fundraiser.

34:49.873 --> 34:51.071
No, Mr. Burdett.

34:51.206 --> 34:52.996
But I am offering you the opportunity

34:53.123 --> 34:55.956
to participate in the vital growth of my infrastructure.

34:56.083 --> 34:57.362
Uh-huh. How's that?

34:57.999 --> 34:59.871
I want you to steal me that diamond.

35:02.791 --> 35:03.988
I'm not a criminal.

35:04.125 --> 35:06.364
Right. Neither am I.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.957
Good.
Then we understand each other.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.457
- Yes.
- Yeah.

35:09.583 --> 35:11.657
Let me show you around, Mr. Burdett.

35:15.167 --> 35:17.738
Do you think it fair that the indigenous of this island

35:17.875 --> 35:20.625
are not allowed to enter the casinos unless they work there?

35:22.126 --> 35:24.496
Why is it that only the rich should enjoy

35:24.626 --> 35:28.785
pharmaceutically-assisted moments of personal introspection?

35:28.918 --> 35:32.579
The safety and security found in owning your own machine gun.

35:33.668 --> 35:34.912
The pleasures derived

35:35.043 --> 35:39.286
from financially-procured female companionship.

35:41.585 --> 35:44.749
The underprivileged should not be denied these essential diversions.

35:44.877 --> 35:47.117
I mean, look around you, Mr. Burdett.

35:47.252 --> 35:48.793
No one is turned away.

35:49.627 --> 35:52.376
All I do, I do for the people.

35:52.502 --> 35:53.995
And why do you need the diamond for that?

35:54.794 --> 35:58.325
I have an urgent need to expand my humanitarian program.

35:58.461 --> 36:01.661
A cash injection in the tens of millions of dollars

36:01.794 --> 36:03.536
would relieve the entire Caribbean.

36:05.711 --> 36:08.460
What I'm suggesting is a partnership, Mr. Burdett.

36:08.586 --> 36:10.743
You are a stranger to this island.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.786
I can give you what you don't have--

36:12.920 --> 36:18.953
access to the marina, the crews, rotation schedules, whatever you need.

36:43.963 --> 36:46.037
I couldn't sleep.
Didn't wanna wake you.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.792
I saw you on the ship yesterday.

36:52.214 --> 36:55.165
I had a feeling you might be there, too.

37:01.839 --> 37:04.506
Don't you ever feel we weren't quite finished?

37:06.631 --> 37:09.914
Look, Max, I miss it, too.

37:11.090 --> 37:12.915
We were great.

37:13.048 --> 37:16.331
And we went out at the top of our game, undefeated.

37:16.465 --> 37:18.752
The best time to quit.

37:19.507 --> 37:21.048
Maybe.

37:23.715 --> 37:25.256
Max, I cased it.

37:25.382 --> 37:28.878
It's not a one man job, and there's no way you're pulling me into it.

37:29.007 --> 37:30.381
We're retired.

37:30.507 --> 37:33.671
Now the challenge is to find joy in simple things.

37:33.799 --> 37:36.335
And I like that challenge.

38:05.051 --> 38:06.046
Yeah?

38:06.176 --> 38:07.171
I lied on the ship.

38:07.301 --> 38:08.675
I <i>could</i> get it.

38:08.801 --> 38:09.796
<i>Here's how.</i>

38:09.926 --> 38:12.497
<i>I'd cut the camera feed and go in from behind the exhibit.</i>

38:12.635 --> 38:15.549
It's blowable from the storage room, and I'd do it after 10 p.m.

38:15.677 --> 38:17.253
Why?

38:17.385 --> 38:20.217
The retired arthritic cops always get that shift.

38:21.219 --> 38:23.126
So that's how you do it.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.670
And now I've told you.

38:24.802 --> 38:26.840
So now I can't.

38:38.803 --> 38:40.379
Oh, my God.

38:40.511 --> 38:42.585
- What are you doing?
- I'm cooking.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.757
- Since when?
- This morning.

38:44.886 --> 38:46.509
We are decent law-abiding people,

38:46.637 --> 38:49.551
and decent law-abiding people cook omelets for breakfast.

38:50.470 --> 38:51.500
Oh.

38:52.470 --> 38:53.797
State your business.

38:53.929 --> 38:55.303
<i>You almost had me last night</i>

38:55.429 --> 38:58.711
<i>with that old David Copperfield smoke and mirrors trick.</i>

38:58.846 --> 39:03.005
"Look at my assistant with the big tits while
I take the Rolex right off your wrist."

39:03.137 --> 39:04.168
What do you want about her?

39:04.304 --> 39:06.094
I wanna know how you're really gonna do it,

39:06.221 --> 39:09.219
and you're gonna tell me while we're fishing.

39:09.346 --> 39:10.460
Fishing?

39:10.596 --> 39:11.875
I don't fish.

39:12.013 --> 39:13.885
I got a boat stacked with beer.

39:14.013 --> 39:15.008
Drink it yourself.

39:15.138 --> 39:16.033
<i>You might as well come.</i>

39:16.060 --> 39:16.954
<i>You're paying for it.</i>

39:17.055 --> 39:18.844
<i>I charged it to my suite.</i>

39:18.972 --> 39:21.507
All the same, Stanley, I'll pass.

39:21.638 --> 39:22.633
There is an option.

39:22.763 --> 39:26.544
I get the local police to bring you down to the station, we sweat you there.

39:26.680 --> 39:27.842
<i>And I do mean sweat.</i>

39:27.972 --> 39:31.302
<i>There's no air conditioning, so dress light.</i>

39:31.431 --> 39:33.303
The eggs on this island taste funny.

39:33.431 --> 39:35.836
They must have some weird chickens.

39:38.639 --> 39:39.836
<i>What'll it be, Max?</i>

39:39.973 --> 39:41.003
I'll see you soon.

39:50.765 --> 39:53.929
Tell me this isn't better than standing in some lineup.

39:54.932 --> 39:56.389
I've never been in a lineup.

40:03.141 --> 40:05.546
Ooh, that's a hell of a watch.

40:05.682 --> 40:06.879
What's that kind of thing run you?

40:07.016 --> 40:09.053
A couple of grand.

40:11.349 --> 40:14.431
Why don't you pick one up on the Bureau's expense account?

40:14.558 --> 40:17.556
Oh, they keep me on a real tight leash.

40:17.683 --> 40:19.306
I got you to thank for that.

40:19.433 --> 40:20.807
Ah.

40:22.142 --> 40:23.682
Whoo! It's cookin' out here.

40:26.642 --> 40:28.763
So if I didn't shoot you, where'd you get the screen door?

40:31.309 --> 40:32.802
Knitting accident.

40:45.059 --> 40:46.931
Dab some of this on my back, will you?

40:47.518 --> 40:48.596
Are you serious?

40:48.726 --> 40:50.321
Yeah. I've got delicate skin.

40:50.348 --> 40:51.501
I don't wanna burn.

40:57.852 --> 41:00.969
I bet you were the best kid in the neighborhood at hide-and-seek, huh?

41:01.102 --> 41:02.346
So you joined the Bureau.

41:02.477 --> 41:04.764
Yeah, I found them all.

41:06.519 --> 41:08.225
No one ever found me.

41:09.061 --> 41:13.268
Once I found a good spot, I'd stay there for days.

41:16.770 --> 41:18.097
There you go.

41:18.228 --> 41:20.302
Now, turn around.
I'll do you.

41:20.436 --> 41:21.467
I'll handle it.

41:21.603 --> 41:23.393
No, come on.
You're gonna burn.

41:32.437 --> 41:33.551
Good.

41:34.645 --> 41:35.640
Okay.

41:35.771 --> 41:37.477
There. That's good.

41:37.604 --> 41:39.346
Wait. Don't you want me to coat everything?

41:39.479 --> 41:40.888
That's good. My pole.

41:41.021 --> 41:42.679
No way, man!
I'm only doing your back!

41:42.813 --> 41:43.807
My pole!

41:43.938 --> 41:45.217
Hey, we got something.
Come on.

41:45.354 --> 41:46.349
Oh, oh, oh. Look at this!

41:46.479 --> 41:48.221
Oh. We got something here, Stanley.

41:48.355 --> 41:49.349
Ooh! Aah!

41:49.480 --> 41:51.435
Shit! Come on!

41:51.563 --> 41:53.104
Come on!
Help me pull it up.

41:53.230 --> 41:55.102
Don't lose it, don't lose it!

41:58.105 --> 41:59.432
- It's a monster.
- We can do it!

41:59.563 --> 42:01.601
This is big.
Okay, come on, pull!

42:01.730 --> 42:03.140
- Are <i>you</i> pulling?
- I'm pulling, man.

42:03.272 --> 42:04.267
Jesus Christ!

42:04.397 --> 42:07.099
Stanley!
One, two, three!

42:07.231 --> 42:09.056
Oh! Aah!

42:09.939 --> 42:10.934
Jesus Christ!

42:11.064 --> 42:12.640
It's a shark, it's a shark.

42:12.772 --> 42:13.767
Yeah.

42:15.773 --> 42:17.265
Why is it not moving?

42:17.398 --> 42:18.280
Maybe it's in shock.

42:18.307 --> 42:19.498
What do you wanna do?

42:19.606 --> 42:20.673
Maybe it's dead.

42:20.700 --> 42:22.299
I mean, it looks dead.

42:23.981 --> 42:25.143
Go over and shake it.

42:25.273 --> 42:27.430
- Why me?
- Well, you're FBI.

42:27.565 --> 42:28.974
What's that have to do with anything?

42:29.107 --> 42:31.856
If it bites your arm off, you get disability for the rest of your life.

42:31.982 --> 42:33.226
- Go!
- <i>You</i> hooked it.

42:33.357 --> 42:34.387
<i>You</i> go see if it's alive.

42:34.524 --> 42:36.100
<i>Yeah, I hooked it, so you go see if it's alive.</i>

42:36.232 --> 42:37.476
- Go!
- Hey, hey!

42:37.607 --> 42:40.440
Oh, okay.
Here I go.

42:41.691 --> 42:43.480
I'm just gonna sneak up on it.

42:44.232 --> 42:45.227
Why are you whispering?

42:45.358 --> 42:47.099
So it won't know the plan.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.482
Hey.

42:56.066 --> 42:57.310
- Aah!
- Aah! Shit!

42:57.442 --> 42:58.851
Watch out, watch out, watch out!

43:03.525 --> 43:06.440
You have the right to remain silent!

43:07.650 --> 43:08.812
Yeah, it's dead.

43:11.859 --> 43:13.482
Yeah.

43:37.444 --> 43:38.438
Look at them.

43:38.569 --> 43:41.816
If you didn't know any better, you'd think they were friends.

43:41.944 --> 43:43.769
You must be Lola.

43:44.527 --> 43:45.522
Sophie?

43:46.486 --> 43:47.599
Nice gun.

43:47.736 --> 43:49.063
Sig Sauer P228.

43:49.194 --> 43:50.984
Custom trigger action.

43:51.111 --> 43:52.189
Oh.

43:52.319 --> 43:53.896
- Nice shoes.
- Thank you.

43:54.028 --> 43:56.149
- Chanel?
- Cruz collection.

43:58.195 --> 43:59.652
How bad was it?

44:00.528 --> 44:02.104
Oh, not too bad.

44:03.862 --> 44:05.189
Sophie seems nice.

44:05.987 --> 44:07.231
Yeah, for a cop.

44:08.487 --> 44:10.193
Lola seems cool.

44:10.320 --> 44:11.434
For a thief.

44:26.696 --> 44:28.106
Yes!

44:33.322 --> 44:34.731
I resign. You win.

44:34.863 --> 44:36.191
Make a wish.

44:36.322 --> 44:38.194
Okay.

44:38.322 --> 44:41.486
I wish you'd write your vows.

44:54.864 --> 44:56.144
<i>I'm so tense.</i>

44:56.281 --> 44:56.997
<i>Come here.</i>

44:57.024 --> 44:58.381
<i>Let me relax you.</i>

44:58.490 --> 44:59.406
<i>What are you doing?</i>

44:59.433 --> 45:01.265
<i>Why are you taking off your clothes?</i>

45:01.365 --> 45:02.360
Now we're talkin'.

45:02.490 --> 45:04.031
<i>Are you being naughty?</i>

45:04.157 --> 45:05.697
<i>Naughty enough to spank.</i>

45:05.823 --> 45:08.146
Oh, yeah!

45:08.282 --> 45:11.233
<i>I'll bite you.
Can I bite you?</i>

45:11.365 --> 45:13.854
<i>The door.
Are we expecting anyone?</i>

45:13.990 --> 45:16.028
<i>Yeah. A friend.</i>

45:16.157 --> 45:17.780
<i>- A friend?
- A friend?</i>

45:17.907 --> 45:19.104
<i>A girlfriend.</i>

45:19.241 --> 45:20.236
<i>You didn't.</i>

45:20.366 --> 45:21.775
<i>I love you, baby.</i>

45:21.908 --> 45:24.443
<i>You know I'll do anything for you.</i>

45:26.908 --> 45:27.938
<i>Wait here.</i>

45:28.075 --> 45:29.567
<i>What's she gonna do?</i>

45:31.033 --> 45:33.024
Tell him.
Tell him.

45:33.158 --> 45:35.232
<i>She's gonna help me relax you.</i>

45:35.367 --> 45:36.859
<i>You're kidding.</i>

45:37.658 --> 45:38.689
Nice.

45:38.825 --> 45:40.366
<i>You're gonna like this.</i>

45:40.492 --> 45:41.736
Lucky bastard.

45:41.867 --> 45:43.905
- <i>Who is she?</i>
- <i>You'll see.</i>

45:44.575 --> 45:48.652
<i>Max, I'd like you to meet Stan's mom.</i>

45:56.368 --> 45:57.481
<i>Night, Stan.</i>

46:01.493 --> 46:02.690
Son of a...

46:59.538 --> 47:01.279
You're only in port 48 more hours.

47:01.413 --> 47:03.071
Stay on high alert.

47:03.205 --> 47:06.072
Agent Lloyd, we have the most sophisticated security system

47:06.205 --> 47:08.658
ever installed on a seagoing vessel.

47:08.788 --> 47:10.115
And you'll need it.

47:10.872 --> 47:12.069
Excuse me, sir.

47:13.080 --> 47:14.952
There's been a security breach.

47:39.415 --> 47:40.493
Don't move!

47:42.957 --> 47:43.952
Turn around.

47:46.290 --> 47:47.404
Turn around!

47:50.249 --> 47:51.279
- No!
- Stan!

48:24.917 --> 48:26.161
Damn it.

48:34.751 --> 48:36.659
The other side!

48:52.210 --> 48:53.289
Just stop him!

48:53.419 --> 48:54.793
Let's do it, come on!

49:17.712 --> 49:20.710
<i>Although the famed Napoleon Diamond was undisturbed,</i>

49:20.837 --> 49:22.543
<i>the unknown intruder knocked out</i>

49:22.670 --> 49:25.206
<i>a Seven Seas Navigator maintenance worker,</i>

49:25.337 --> 49:26.608
<i>stole his uniform.</i>

49:26.635 --> 49:28.610
<i>and slipped onto the ship.</i>

49:36.671 --> 49:38.413
You're cheating on me, aren't you?

49:39.963 --> 49:41.669
What are you talking about?

49:41.796 --> 49:44.581
Maybe not with a woman, but with a diamond.

49:45.380 --> 49:46.375
You want her.

49:46.505 --> 49:48.460
And I'm jealous.

49:48.588 --> 49:50.544
You've got nothing to worry about.

49:50.672 --> 49:52.462
Where were you tonight, Max?

49:52.589 --> 49:56.417
I've been home, writing my vows.

49:56.547 --> 49:57.542
Oh! Let me see.

49:57.672 --> 50:00.670
Sorry.
You have to wait.

50:01.714 --> 50:03.752
Well, I'm not gonna let that little bitch take my man.

50:03.881 --> 50:05.504
I'm gonna fight for what's mine.

50:05.631 --> 50:06.661
Really?

50:06.798 --> 50:09.121
And how exactly are you gonna do that?

50:09.256 --> 50:10.797
I'm a thief.

50:11.798 --> 50:14.168
I know a thing or two about distraction.

50:19.673 --> 50:22.292
It's a beautiful jewel, Max.

50:23.340 --> 50:27.464
But I guarantee you, it's no fun in the tub.

50:30.216 --> 50:31.756
Mmm.

50:32.507 --> 50:35.210
I had him.
You shoulda stayed out of my way.

50:35.341 --> 50:37.664
I didn't want you to get hurt.
I'm sorry.

50:37.799 --> 50:39.288
You're the one who's hurt.

50:39.315 --> 50:40.574
You should ice that.

50:40.674 --> 50:42.961
Why are men always trying to protect women?

50:43.633 --> 50:44.877
'Cause you smell good.

50:45.008 --> 50:46.631
It's all about sex, isn't it?

50:46.758 --> 50:49.329
Why can't we just be two cops working a case?

50:49.467 --> 50:51.090
Hey, I happen to agree with you.

50:51.217 --> 50:53.207
From now on, we're just partners on this.

50:53.342 --> 50:54.455
Fine.

50:54.592 --> 50:56.832
- So, let's have dinner and discuss it.
- No, thanks.

50:56.967 --> 50:58.294
How about a steam?

50:58.425 --> 51:01.791
What-- I-- no, I always steam with my partners.

51:02.592 --> 51:05.046
Okay, you wanna go for a Jacuzzi, partner?

51:05.176 --> 51:07.629
I have a big tub in my room.

51:20.802 --> 51:22.342
We have to talk.

51:22.468 --> 51:25.135
Max. Great timing.
Ride with us.

51:25.260 --> 51:26.883
Can we just do this one on one?

51:27.010 --> 51:28.384
Oh, of course.

51:30.135 --> 51:33.169
<i>California dreaming...</i>

51:33.302 --> 51:36.798
Are you familiar with the pleasures of anonymous love, Max?

51:38.344 --> 51:39.339
No.

51:40.428 --> 51:44.089
Recently I found myself experimenting with alternative lifestyle parameters

51:44.220 --> 51:46.376
based largely on the free love philosophy

51:46.511 --> 51:49.509
as found in the collected works of The Mamas and The Papas.

51:50.762 --> 51:52.338
I never made that connection.

51:52.470 --> 51:53.548
Oh, it's there.

51:53.678 --> 51:56.381
That Michelle Phillips, she could walk it like she talked it.

51:56.512 --> 51:58.798
Earl, burn one of my CDs for Max.

51:58.929 --> 52:00.421
Yes, sir.

52:12.596 --> 52:14.053
This is it, Max.

52:14.179 --> 52:15.459
My vision.

52:16.346 --> 52:18.917
My infrastructure growing before our eyes.

52:19.805 --> 52:20.883
It used to be a children's hospital,

52:21.013 --> 52:24.841
but I'm revitalizing it into a paramilitary training facility.

52:24.972 --> 52:28.633
More importantly, that ship is leaving in two days.

52:32.264 --> 52:33.259
What's this?

52:33.389 --> 52:34.716
Everything you need.

52:35.347 --> 52:37.468
Schematics, detailed plan.

52:37.597 --> 52:39.588
You can do it yourself.

52:41.306 --> 52:43.261
Go in through the air conditioning vents.

52:43.389 --> 52:46.222
The exhibit is accessible from the storage facility behind it.

52:46.348 --> 52:49.548
There's cameras there, so you're gonna have to cut the central feed.

52:49.681 --> 52:51.340
Red wires in the control panel here.

52:51.473 --> 52:54.673
If you don't cut the red wire, they'll see everything.

52:54.807 --> 52:57.378
- What next?
- Blow the wall.

52:57.515 --> 52:58.842
- C-4?
- Uh-uh.

52:58.974 --> 53:01.676
I'd use a shape charge with a detonation cord.

53:01.807 --> 53:04.177
Smaller but more effective.

53:04.307 --> 53:08.431
And... you'd wanna blow it after 10 p.m.

53:08.557 --> 53:11.591
- Why is that?
- Graveyard shift.

53:11.724 --> 53:14.391
Always the retired cops with arthritis.

53:14.516 --> 53:16.174
That's how I'd do it.

53:17.516 --> 53:18.974
Then that's how I'll do it.

53:22.350 --> 53:24.554
You know, we're not partners anymore, Max.

53:25.308 --> 53:27.844
In fact, you see me, cross the street.

53:52.060 --> 53:53.055
<i>You gotta go</i>

53:53.185 --> 53:54.891
<i>Go where you wanna go</i>

53:55.018 --> 53:56.843
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

53:56.977 --> 54:01.101
<i>With whoever you wanna do it with</i>

54:01.227 --> 54:03.976
<i>You gotta go where you wanna go</i>

54:04.102 --> 54:06.306
<i>Do what you wanna do</i>

54:06.435 --> 54:10.560
<i>With whoever you wanna do it with</i>

54:10.686 --> 54:16.137
<i>You don't understand that a girl like...</i>

54:17.019 --> 54:19.140
Good afternoon. Atlantis.
How may I help?

54:19.269 --> 54:21.556
Mr. Lloyd,
the Bridge Suite, please.

54:23.061 --> 54:24.139
<i>Hello.</i>

54:24.270 --> 54:25.597
<i>- Stanley.
- Yeah.</i>

54:25.728 --> 54:27.140
<i>It's Max, just checking in.</i>

54:27.167 --> 54:28.421
<i>Cut the crap, Max.</i>

54:28.520 --> 54:30.843
<i>You're making sure I'm in my room and not following you.</i>

54:30.978 --> 54:33.763
How could you be following me if you're in your room?

54:33.895 --> 54:36.265
<i>- See you soon, Stanley.
- Okay.</i>

56:16.734 --> 56:17.764
Hello!

56:18.942 --> 56:19.937
What?

56:21.359 --> 56:22.354
What?

56:22.484 --> 56:25.648
If you're gonna forward your calls, don't tail me so close.

56:31.235 --> 56:32.432
Aah!

57:44.989 --> 57:46.529
Hey.

57:46.655 --> 57:48.445
I heard the call over the radio.

57:48.572 --> 57:51.736
Every year there's one white boy that goes down at Junkanoo.

57:52.572 --> 57:53.865
Here's what I found out.

57:53.892 --> 57:54.968
Max closed escrow,

57:55.073 --> 57:57.691
and then a month later the cruise booked the diamond.

57:57.823 --> 58:00.109
- Maybe he <i>is</i> retired.
- I doubt it.

58:00.240 --> 58:01.946
He met with Henri Mooré today,

58:02.073 --> 58:04.064
the biggest gangster on the island.

58:05.615 --> 58:06.859
Thanks for coming.

58:06.990 --> 58:09.858
You know, this one you really do have to ice.

58:09.990 --> 58:12.277
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58:16.032 --> 58:17.110
Better?

58:18.032 --> 58:19.525
There's another one here.

58:22.116 --> 58:23.194
Now?

58:23.324 --> 58:25.611
This one's particularly painful.

58:29.366 --> 58:31.406
There's some referred pain.

58:31.433 --> 58:33.849
It's somewhere around... here.

58:38.033 --> 58:40.237
I'll have to get hurt more often.

58:40.367 --> 58:42.737
And in more interesting places.

59:03.243 --> 59:05.648
- Oh, God, I'm vibrating!
- So am I.

59:05.785 --> 59:08.404
No. No, no.

59:08.535 --> 59:10.572
- I'm getting a call.
- What?

59:10.702 --> 59:12.776
Is nothing sacred?

59:12.910 --> 59:13.988
Shit, I have to go.

59:14.118 --> 59:15.373
Go? No, you can't go.

59:15.400 --> 59:17.012
I just unwrapped my head.

59:17.119 --> 59:18.742
Sorry, I need a rain check.

59:18.869 --> 59:19.975
What, are you crazy?

59:20.002 --> 59:21.218
It never rains here.

59:21.327 --> 59:22.405
Just give me five minutes, all right?

59:22.536 --> 59:25.024
Five minutes?
You should be embarrassed.

59:25.161 --> 59:26.405
Okay, three.

59:26.536 --> 59:28.573
Oh, Stan, come on.

59:28.703 --> 59:31.191
Okay, two!
Please don't make me beg. Please.

59:31.328 --> 59:32.572
A quick two?

59:32.703 --> 59:35.274
Oh, don't worry, I'm quick.

01:00:02.121 --> 01:00:03.116
Hello.

01:00:03.246 --> 01:00:05.036
Mr. Burdett, it's Luc from the bar.

01:00:05.163 --> 01:00:08.244
There's a guest down here that's bombed that's shouting your name.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:11.156
Welcome to paradise, Frank!

01:00:13.163 --> 01:00:18.864
Well, it's only paradise for criminals, like Max Burdett.

01:00:18.997 --> 01:00:22.742
Yeah. I hear him.
I'll be right there.

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:27.865
- Where'd he go?
- Over there.

01:00:27.997 --> 01:00:29.241
Oh, thanks, Luc.

01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.954
What are you doing to yourself?
What's wrong?

01:00:34.081 --> 01:00:35.111
- Nothing.
- Nothing's wrong?

01:00:37.123 --> 01:00:39.327
Me and Sophie hooked up.

01:00:39.456 --> 01:00:41.198
And it was beautiful.

01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:44.121
But it's only gonna last for one more day.

01:00:44.248 --> 01:00:45.492
Why is that?

01:00:45.623 --> 01:00:48.242
Because the ship's only gonna be here 24 more hours,

01:00:48.373 --> 01:00:49.996
and you're gonna clip Napoleon Ill

01:00:50.124 --> 01:00:51.996
and make me look like a jerk again.

01:00:55.832 --> 01:00:57.740
- I'll have another one!
- You've had enough.

01:00:57.874 --> 01:00:59.664
You are not my daddy.

01:00:59.791 --> 01:01:03.121
I didn't take you as an umbrella kind of guy, Stan.

01:01:03.249 --> 01:01:05.157
These remoras really have a kick to 'em.

01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.235
Hey, Stan, buck up.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.355
You're a good agent.

01:01:07.458 --> 01:01:09.413
No, I'm not.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.409
You know, I used to blame you, but now I see it clearly.

01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:14.911
It's not you, it's me.

01:01:15.042 --> 01:01:16.914
You've got genius, man.

01:01:17.042 --> 01:01:21.367
If I had an ounce of what you have, I'd never stop.

01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:25.162
You've got a gift, man.
It's inspiring.

01:01:27.126 --> 01:01:29.246
I love these remoras!

01:01:29.376 --> 01:01:32.243
Bartender! Give me another one!

01:01:39.793 --> 01:01:41.583
It's okay, Stan.
It's okay.

01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:43.967
Luc, you're not working tonight, right?

01:01:43.994 --> 01:01:45.267
Give us a hand here.

01:01:45.376 --> 01:01:47.083
Come on, Stan, here you go.
Come on.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:49.165
Here you go, buddy.
Yeah.

01:01:50.627 --> 01:01:52.084
Come on, come on.

01:01:52.919 --> 01:01:54.826
What about me?!

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.082
That's it, Stanley.

01:01:58.211 --> 01:01:59.787
Here you go.

01:01:59.919 --> 01:02:01.080
That's it.

01:02:03.169 --> 01:02:04.745
That's it. Here we go.

01:02:18.295 --> 01:02:20.665
You tell anyone I tucked him in,
I'll kill you.

01:02:21.462 --> 01:02:24.211
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

01:02:24.379 --> 01:02:26.120
- Max.
- Okay.

01:02:53.838 --> 01:02:54.917
Lola!

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:57.619
It's locked.
And don't try to break in.

01:02:57.839 --> 01:02:58.869
You're not welcome.

01:03:01.297 --> 01:03:02.873
I finished the deck.

01:03:03.006 --> 01:03:06.336
You promised to spend the first sunset on it together.

01:03:06.464 --> 01:03:08.620
- Lola.
- That's not all.

01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:11.047
I found your notebook.

01:03:12.048 --> 01:03:14.085
Lola.

01:03:14.215 --> 01:03:16.668
I'll sit down right now and write my vows, okay?

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:24.505
The vows are not for me, they're for you.

01:03:24.632 --> 01:03:27.713
You have to figure out if what we have means anything to you.

01:03:30.965 --> 01:03:32.044
Come on, Max.

01:03:32.882 --> 01:03:34.920
Do you really think the third one's gonna make you whole?

01:03:38.299 --> 01:03:41.416
- I don't know.
- Well, don't come back until you do.

01:03:43.299 --> 01:03:45.171
Where am I supposed to go?

01:03:49.925 --> 01:03:51.003
She threw me out.

01:03:52.508 --> 01:03:54.298
Why is it my problem?

01:03:54.425 --> 01:03:56.795
'Cause every hotel on the island is booked.

01:04:02.259 --> 01:04:04.582
Can I move this surveillance stuff?

01:04:04.717 --> 01:04:06.162
Don't mess with it!

01:04:06.189 --> 01:04:07.860
It's very expensive.

01:04:08.717 --> 01:04:12.415
Listen, I'm not gonna sleep on the floor.

01:04:12.551 --> 01:04:15.336
Well, I guess you're out of luck.

01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:16.747
We both are.

01:04:17.885 --> 01:04:19.046
Move over.

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.755
Shit.

01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:37.796
So what'd you do?

01:04:39.136 --> 01:04:42.502
I missed our first sunset on her new deck.

01:04:43.886 --> 01:04:44.881
That's it?

01:04:53.011 --> 01:04:54.967
I'm no good at sunsets.

01:04:57.137 --> 01:04:58.629
Of course you're not.

01:04:59.553 --> 01:05:03.049
The world is divided up between people who like to watch the sunset

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:04.464
and those who don't.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:06.500
Yeah.

01:05:06.637 --> 01:05:09.470
People like you are never happy.

01:05:09.596 --> 01:05:14.419
You're anxious, type-A, egocentric perfectionists who can't sit still

01:05:14.554 --> 01:05:18.418
and die alone with a million bucks and a thousand regrets.

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:22.096
The people who can relax, enjoy the sunset,

01:05:22.221 --> 01:05:26.381
hold hands at the end of the day--
they're the happy ones.

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:32.047
So why can't you do that?

01:05:36.097 --> 01:05:37.424
Because of you.

01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:44.089
Don't hog the blanket.

01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:51.137
- Good night, Max.
- Good night.

01:06:37.434 --> 01:06:39.471
You know, the Bureau's got a "don't ask, don't tell" policy,

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.472
but this is pushing it, Stan.

01:06:41.601 --> 01:06:43.887
Kowalski, Stafford.

01:06:44.017 --> 01:06:45.012
Sophie?

01:06:45.226 --> 01:06:47.761
The L.A. office got a call from Inspector Bethel here.

01:06:47.893 --> 01:06:51.140
He wanted to know the scope of the FBI's operation on the island.

01:06:51.268 --> 01:06:53.342
Since we don't have an operation on the island,

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:55.218
we felt we'd come here and check it out.

01:06:55.351 --> 01:06:56.678
What's he talking about, Stan?

01:06:56.810 --> 01:06:58.007
Let me explain.

01:06:58.143 --> 01:06:59.075
He's on suspension.

01:06:59.103 --> 01:07:00.622
He has been for three months.

01:07:00.727 --> 01:07:01.805
Suspension?

01:07:01.935 --> 01:07:04.424
He was deemed unstable after he lost Napoleon II.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.017
You told me you were here on the case.

01:07:06.144 --> 01:07:07.601
I am here on the case,

01:07:07.727 --> 01:07:11.342
and once I bust this guy, get reinstated, upped,

01:07:11.477 --> 01:07:12.851
these slobs will be saluting me.

01:07:12.977 --> 01:07:14.256
Are you guys dating?

01:07:14.394 --> 01:07:16.219
He's nothing but a suspect to me.

01:07:16.352 --> 01:07:18.888
- Oh, really?
- That's not what these show.

01:07:19.561 --> 01:07:21.219
Your suspect's paying for this suite.

01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:22.845
And the seaweed body wraps.

01:07:22.978 --> 01:07:24.636
You two look pretty chummy.

01:07:27.353 --> 01:07:29.676
So you lied to me, Stan.

01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:32.514
And you got your slice of paradise, hmm?

01:07:33.228 --> 01:07:35.266
I hope it was everything you thought it would be.

01:07:35.395 --> 01:07:36.592
Sophie...

01:07:36.728 --> 01:07:39.929
You might want to do more of a background check next time

01:07:40.062 --> 01:07:41.519
before you partner up.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:49.430
She didn't have to be so hard on you, you know?

01:07:49.563 --> 01:07:51.139
Storming out like that.

01:07:51.271 --> 01:07:53.096
She's got grounds.

01:07:53.229 --> 01:07:56.263
The thing you gotta understand about us law enforcement types

01:07:56.396 --> 01:07:58.553
is we don't much appreciate lying.

01:07:58.688 --> 01:08:01.639
Come on, Stan, you fibbed, maybe withheld a little.

01:08:01.771 --> 01:08:03.181
But lie? Nah.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:08.475
You are an FBI agent working a case.

01:08:09.564 --> 01:08:11.601
You know, when you put it like that, it doesn't sound so bad.

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:13.520
I could explain it to her.

01:08:14.772 --> 01:08:16.099
What about you?

01:08:16.231 --> 01:08:18.600
You are a hell of a catch.

01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:21.100
I've seen the way you are with Lola.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.392
You love that girl.

01:08:22.523 --> 01:08:25.058
So you're working out some personal issues.

01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:27.145
All you need is a little support.

01:08:27.273 --> 01:08:28.350
Exactly.

01:08:28.481 --> 01:08:30.768
Hell, I could make her understand.

01:08:37.689 --> 01:08:40.688
Max can't eat, can't sleep.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:42.723
He's like an injured bird.

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:45.096
Stan's hurt.
He's in pain.

01:08:45.232 --> 01:08:46.938
He's like a wounded dog.

01:08:47.066 --> 01:08:48.216
He needs you, Lola.

01:08:48.243 --> 01:08:49.758
You're his better half.

01:08:49.857 --> 01:08:51.100
Just give him one more chance.

01:08:51.232 --> 01:08:53.104
He's a good guy, Sophie.

01:08:53.233 --> 01:08:56.515
I'm sure he's a liar, but that comes with the job.

01:08:57.566 --> 01:08:58.450
I don't know.

01:08:58.477 --> 01:09:00.377
This is all a bit strange.

01:09:00.483 --> 01:09:02.189
What do you think, Lola?

01:09:02.316 --> 01:09:03.662
I don't buy a word of it.

01:09:03.689 --> 01:09:04.712
I'm with you.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:06.144
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:06.779
Listen, hear us out.

01:09:06.807 --> 01:09:07.462
Come on, one second.

01:09:07.567 --> 01:09:08.562
Look...

01:09:10.733 --> 01:09:13.304
Tonight the lies stop.

01:09:13.442 --> 01:09:14.899
He's serious. It's over.

01:09:15.024 --> 01:09:17.644
He's not chasin' it, and I'm not chasin' him.

01:09:17.776 --> 01:09:21.224
I'm sorry, but I won't believe you until that ship is gone.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:23.397
And we still got a few hours before she sails.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:25.647
Look, I can't make that ship disappear tonight,

01:09:25.776 --> 01:09:27.020
but I can make us disappear.

01:09:27.151 --> 01:09:28.987
What are you talking about?

01:09:29.014 --> 01:09:30.506
I found a hobby.

01:09:32.484 --> 01:09:33.015
Wait a minute.

01:09:33.042 --> 01:09:34.252
You didn't tell me about this.

01:09:34.359 --> 01:09:36.149
When we come up for air,

01:09:36.277 --> 01:09:40.057
that ship will be headed to Paris and the diamond will be gone forever.

01:10:02.611 --> 01:10:04.436
So, where you taking us?

01:10:04.570 --> 01:10:06.726
We're headed to a hidden reef where there's rumored to be

01:10:06.861 --> 01:10:09.231
100 million in gold somewhere among the wreckage.

01:10:10.195 --> 01:10:11.392
You're kidding.

01:10:14.737 --> 01:10:15.732
Wow!

01:10:15.862 --> 01:10:17.568
Look at this.

01:10:17.695 --> 01:10:20.729
Yeah, these ships have been down here since the '40s,

01:10:20.862 --> 01:10:23.149
but nobody's ever found any gold.

01:10:23.279 --> 01:10:26.111
Well, maybe with the help of the FBI we'll get lucky.

01:10:27.279 --> 01:10:29.069
My money's on Max.

01:10:29.196 --> 01:10:33.107
100 million four ways-- that's 25 million apiece if we split it.

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:39.816
Have any idea where to start?

01:10:39.947 --> 01:10:41.783
It could be anywhere down here.

01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:43.587
Let's split up, look around.

01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:47.488
You guys sure this is safe?

01:10:47.515 --> 01:10:49.674
I'm allergic to shellfish.

01:10:49.780 --> 01:10:51.570
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:10:51.597 --> 01:10:53.386
I've seen how you handle sharks.

01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.236
When we get back, I'm buying everyone umbrella drinks.

01:11:32.241 --> 01:11:35.986
Hey, little guy, have you seen any gold down here?

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.315
Hey, Max, I'm counting on you to make me a rich man.

01:12:28.744 --> 01:12:31.411
Lola, hypothetically speaking,

01:12:31.536 --> 01:12:34.285
what's it like to hold 25 million in your hands?

01:12:35.203 --> 01:12:37.489
I have no idea what you're talking about.

01:12:38.328 --> 01:12:39.323
Right.

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.953
- Good night, old-timer.
- Eat shit.

01:13:36.414 --> 01:13:38.073
What the hell is that?

01:13:41.248 --> 01:13:43.819
There is an intruder in Storage Facility B.

01:13:43.956 --> 01:13:45.273
- <i>Attempted break-in in progress.</i>

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.056
- Son of a bitch!

01:13:46.165 --> 01:13:48.535
<i>All security to Storage Facility B.</i>

01:15:12.086 --> 01:15:13.081
<i>Hey, Max.</i>

01:15:16.003 --> 01:15:16.998
What's up?

01:15:17.128 --> 01:15:19.000
Where are you?

01:15:19.128 --> 01:15:21.533
Oh, I'm somewhere inside the ship.

01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:24.917
Oh, yeah, me too.
Thanks, that helps a lot.

01:15:25.045 --> 01:15:28.292
Max, did you say you were <i>inside</i> the ship?

01:15:29.129 --> 01:15:31.534
Yeah, it's amazing.

01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:34.834
Hmm. Really?
What do you see?

01:15:34.962 --> 01:15:36.089
<i>It's pretty dark.</i>

01:15:36.116 --> 01:15:38.769
<i>I think I'm in the captain's quarters.</i>

01:15:38.879 --> 01:15:40.455
That's interesting.

01:15:46.171 --> 01:15:50.117
Max, suddenly I don't feel like having an umbrella drink.

01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:04.999
I'm beginning to think we're gonna go home empty-handed.

01:16:05.131 --> 01:16:05.918
Where are you, Max?

01:16:05.945 --> 01:16:07.562
I'm gonna come hunt with you a while.

01:16:07.672 --> 01:16:09.877
I'm coming to you.

01:16:10.714 --> 01:16:11.894
How you see me?

01:16:11.922 --> 01:16:13.573
I cut the red wire.

01:16:13.673 --> 01:16:15.193
Ah, nice work, genius.

01:16:15.220 --> 01:16:17.775
You cut the heating to the Jacuzzi.

01:16:20.173 --> 01:16:22.626
<i>Max, you at the stern?</i>

01:16:24.923 --> 01:16:26.120
<i>Max?</i>

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:32.126
<i>Stan Lloyd to Max Burdett.</i>
<i>Come in.</i>

01:16:36.091 --> 01:16:38.579
Who'd he think he was, the Invisible Man?

01:16:41.674 --> 01:16:42.918
Dear God.

01:16:43.049 --> 01:16:45.123
Shit.

01:16:45.258 --> 01:16:46.118
It was a diversion.

01:16:46.145 --> 01:16:47.321
Get back to the diamond!

01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:51.249
<i>Max, where are you?</i>

01:16:58.508 --> 01:16:59.966
<i>Will you answer me?</i>

01:17:00.092 --> 01:17:01.336
<i>Hello!</i>

01:17:01.467 --> 01:17:02.664
There!

01:17:10.301 --> 01:17:11.433
He's in the vents!

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.780
He got the diamond!

01:17:12.884 --> 01:17:14.507
Max, what was that?

01:17:14.634 --> 01:17:16.257
<i>Max!</i>

01:17:16.384 --> 01:17:18.174
I think he left his radio.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.588
I thought I heard something else.

01:17:21.301 --> 01:17:22.254
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

01:17:22.282 --> 01:17:23.614
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

01:17:39.927 --> 01:17:41.799
Nice costume.

01:17:43.177 --> 01:17:44.670
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:17:46.386 --> 01:17:48.875
<i>Party all the time, party all the time</i>

01:17:49.011 --> 01:17:51.416
<i>Party all the time</i>

01:17:51.553 --> 01:17:54.586
<i>My girl wants to party all the time...</i>

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:57.125
Go back to your cabin, please.

01:17:58.553 --> 01:18:00.509
Aha, there you are!

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.834
Hey, Max, come on.

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.128
Last night we were spooning.

01:18:03.156 --> 01:18:04.154
Now you're running away?

01:18:05.512 --> 01:18:06.921
<i>Come on!</i>

01:18:07.595 --> 01:18:09.800
Yoo-hoo, Max.

01:18:26.638 --> 01:18:29.553
Oh, I get it.
A little hide-and-seek.

01:18:38.847 --> 01:18:41.881
Like I told you on the boat, I caught 'em all.

01:18:49.431 --> 01:18:52.050
You're good, but you're not that good.

01:18:57.681 --> 01:19:01.592
You know what they say--
the FBI always gets their man.

01:19:05.098 --> 01:19:06.591
Max!

01:19:06.724 --> 01:19:08.300
I'm having an air problem!

01:19:09.474 --> 01:19:11.215
Stan, are you okay?

01:19:11.349 --> 01:19:14.098
I can't breathe! Help!

01:19:16.224 --> 01:19:17.551
Where are you, Stan?

01:19:20.558 --> 01:19:22.134
I'm coming, Stan.

01:19:22.266 --> 01:19:25.015
It's okay, Stan.
I'm right here.

01:19:25.141 --> 01:19:26.303
Take off your mask.

01:19:27.266 --> 01:19:28.344
I got him, honey.

01:19:28.475 --> 01:19:29.967
I'm right here.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.889
You're okay, Stan.

01:19:35.267 --> 01:19:37.222
Nothing to worry about, partner.

01:19:42.934 --> 01:19:45.636
I saw my life flash before my eyes.

01:19:45.851 --> 01:19:48.090
Leave it to me to get the faulty regulator.

01:19:48.267 --> 01:19:50.637
You know, I never dove before.

01:19:51.309 --> 01:19:52.875
I would like to propose a toast.

01:19:52.902 --> 01:19:54.369
What are we celebrating?

01:19:55.226 --> 01:19:56.221
Retirement.

01:19:57.935 --> 01:19:59.475
- I'll drink to that.
- Good.

01:20:03.685 --> 01:20:04.680
Hello.

01:20:06.518 --> 01:20:07.762
What?

01:20:07.893 --> 01:20:09.090
How?

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.134
- What's wrong?
- The diamond's been stolen.

01:20:12.269 --> 01:20:15.053
- What?
- Half an hour ago.

01:20:18.436 --> 01:20:19.466
You set us up.

01:20:19.602 --> 01:20:20.764
Come on.

01:20:20.894 --> 01:20:22.221
This whole thing.

01:20:23.436 --> 01:20:26.268
You got your perfect alibi-- me.

01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:28.101
Hey.

01:20:28.228 --> 01:20:29.934
Get your hands up.

01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:31.851
Are you serious?

01:20:31.978 --> 01:20:33.601
No wonder you just retired.

01:20:33.728 --> 01:20:36.845
You don't have anything left to steal.

01:20:36.978 --> 01:20:38.554
I've got to get to the ship.

01:20:39.478 --> 01:20:40.675
You couldn't resist, could you?

01:20:40.812 --> 01:20:42.803
You had to screw me one last time.

01:20:42.937 --> 01:20:45.473
You had to make an ass out of me!

01:20:53.104 --> 01:20:55.723
Hey, Lola.
Lola, wait.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:05.975
Hey.

01:21:10.563 --> 01:21:12.519
You really did save me down there.

01:21:20.231 --> 01:21:21.967
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

01:21:21.994 --> 01:21:23.836
I was only trying to protect you.

01:21:23.939 --> 01:21:25.017
How generous of you.

01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:26.242
You were right, you know.

01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:27.627
I couldn't do it without you.

01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:31.262
You gotta admit, though, the look on Stan's face was sheer poetry.

01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:32.974
Shut up, Max.

01:21:33.106 --> 01:21:34.101
Hey.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.637
Lola, please.

01:21:38.773 --> 01:21:41.558
Max, I helped you because I love you.

01:21:41.690 --> 01:21:43.313
But now I'm leaving you.

01:21:50.357 --> 01:21:53.272
Lola, I thought you'd appreciate how I did it,

01:21:53.399 --> 01:21:56.350
you of all people.
Hey, hey.

01:21:58.774 --> 01:22:01.808
I do.
It was a smart plan, Max.

01:22:01.941 --> 01:22:04.098
You're a great thief.

01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:06.310
But I want a great man.

01:22:13.358 --> 01:22:14.816
Lola.

01:22:17.609 --> 01:22:18.806
Move inside.

01:22:21.526 --> 01:22:24.014
What, you thought this was over?
Turn around!

01:22:26.942 --> 01:22:29.312
I tried to deal with you from an elevated place, man,

01:22:29.443 --> 01:22:31.813
appeal to your intellect, spit poetry and shit at you.

01:22:31.943 --> 01:22:34.478
But no, man, you had to bring me down to the gutter.

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:35.688
Where is the diamond?

01:22:35.818 --> 01:22:37.381
She's got nothing to do with this.

01:22:37.408 --> 01:22:38.463
Oh, she does now.

01:22:38.568 --> 01:22:40.772
You kill my dog, I'm gonna slay your cat.

01:22:40.902 --> 01:22:42.181
Don't get--

01:22:50.152 --> 01:22:51.266
Aah!

01:22:52.236 --> 01:22:54.641
Nice throw, bitch!

01:22:54.777 --> 01:22:56.270
No!

01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.604
Where'd you come from?

01:23:43.113 --> 01:23:45.058
He asked me to help him steal it a week ago.

01:23:45.085 --> 01:23:45.924
I turned him down.

01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:47.487
He must have stolen it himself,

01:23:47.613 --> 01:23:50.481
then he came back here to make sure there were no loose ends.

01:23:50.614 --> 01:23:53.019
So why didn't you come to me, tell me what they were planning?

01:23:53.155 --> 01:23:54.648
He said he'd kill us.

01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:56.439
You wouldn't have believed him anyway.

01:23:56.572 --> 01:23:58.610
You thought Mooré was the Second Coming for this island.

01:23:58.739 --> 01:24:00.611
Don't tell me what I think, woman.

01:24:01.781 --> 01:24:04.104
- Where's the diamond?
- I have no idea.

01:24:04.239 --> 01:24:05.810
They were trying to frame us.

01:24:05.837 --> 01:24:07.299
Are we finished here?

01:24:11.281 --> 01:24:13.817
You know, I don't believe a word of what you're saying.

01:24:14.615 --> 01:24:15.693
I know.

01:24:33.949 --> 01:24:35.276
Don't leave.

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:40.074
Good luck, Max.

01:26:04.579 --> 01:26:05.693
Lola, wait.

01:26:06.287 --> 01:26:07.864
Hear me out.

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.824
It's not gonna work, Max.

01:26:09.851 --> 01:26:11.020
Not this time.

01:26:11.121 --> 01:26:14.487
I know it's too late, but I finally wrote them. See?

01:26:15.288 --> 01:26:16.449
Lots of words.

01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:19.068
But I don't need to read them because I know it by heart.

01:26:20.080 --> 01:26:23.860
I've spent my whole life chasing things which I thought were valuable,

01:26:23.997 --> 01:26:27.279
when the only thing I really cared for was right in front of me all along.

01:26:29.747 --> 01:26:31.489
You are my heart, Lola.

01:26:32.664 --> 01:26:35.283
From this moment on, you are my only jewel.

01:26:36.206 --> 01:26:38.955
I want a life filled with sunsets.

01:26:39.123 --> 01:26:42.654
And I never wanna watch one of them without you, not ever.

01:26:49.290 --> 01:26:51.446
The first diamond I've ever bought.

01:26:54.873 --> 01:26:57.990
I love you, Lola Cirillo.

01:26:59.957 --> 01:27:01.236
Marry me.

01:27:11.874 --> 01:27:14.161
- On one condition.
- Anything.

01:27:14.874 --> 01:27:16.284
I want the receipt.

01:27:26.625 --> 01:27:27.620
Here you go, Luc.

01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:29.243
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:31.088
Jack on the rocks, with an umbrella.

01:27:31.115 --> 01:27:32.684
What the hell, I'm celebrating.

01:27:33.292 --> 01:27:36.077
Forget the Jack on the rocks, let's have remoras all around.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.666
Remoras all around.

01:27:37.792 --> 01:27:40.115
Stanley, what the hell are you doing here?

01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:42.704
Well, I thought I'd stick around.

01:27:44.501 --> 01:27:46.622
Oh, yeah, look familiar?

01:27:46.751 --> 01:27:48.991
Treated myself, maxed out the credit card.

01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:50.667
But it suits me, don't you think?

01:27:50.793 --> 01:27:53.542
Well, it must take a bite out of a government salary.

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:55.576
Ah, I can afford it all right.

01:27:56.668 --> 01:27:59.501
Come on, let's sip our remoras and talk, shall we?

01:28:17.711 --> 01:28:19.583
I thought you said these things have a kick.

01:28:22.795 --> 01:28:24.371
Luc, what's in this?

01:28:24.503 --> 01:28:27.667
Orange juice, mango juice, grenadine, and coconut milk.

01:28:29.378 --> 01:28:30.373
No liquor?

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:35.165
<i>Nada.</i>

01:28:37.962 --> 01:28:40.285
I love these remoras!

01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:42.328
Bartender, give me another!

01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:50.874
You tell anyone I tucked him in, I'll kill you.

01:28:52.130 --> 01:28:54.832
- Sure thing, Mr. Burdett.
- Call me Max.

01:28:54.963 --> 01:28:56.337
- Max.
- Okay.

01:29:04.464 --> 01:29:07.664
You know,
I really like that cove.

01:29:15.798 --> 01:29:16.561
Are you okay?

01:29:16.588 --> 01:29:18.526
'Cause you don't look too good.

01:29:22.798 --> 01:29:27.254
As an underwater enthusiast, you should know what a remora really is, Max.

01:29:27.382 --> 01:29:30.333
A remora is kind of a stowaway,

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:34.957
a suckerfish that sticks to the shark's body and feeds off it.

01:29:35.090 --> 01:29:36.713
The shark does all the work,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.922
but the remora gets the spoils.

01:29:52.383 --> 01:29:53.580
You did it, Stan.

01:29:56.508 --> 01:29:57.835
Right from the start.

01:29:58.967 --> 01:30:01.253
It's the only one you two haven't stolen.

01:30:02.467 --> 01:30:03.841
You set me up.

01:30:03.967 --> 01:30:06.669
I revel in it.
I revel in it!

01:30:11.884 --> 01:30:15.664
Could it be that the great Max Burdett has finally lost?

01:30:19.926 --> 01:30:21.087
No, I didn't.

01:30:23.134 --> 01:30:24.414
I got Lola.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.300
Congratulations, Stan.

01:30:36.885 --> 01:30:38.876
I'm looking at it right now.

01:30:39.010 --> 01:30:41.581
My plane takes off in ten minutes.

01:30:41.719 --> 01:30:45.499
Tomorrow morning the bidding will start at $30 million,

01:30:45.636 --> 01:30:48.255
and if I were you, I'd bring cash.

You win some, you lose some.

01:31:00.178 --> 01:31:02.169
We still have the sunsets.

01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:05.548
Yeah.

01:31:05.678 --> 01:31:08.842
Don't worry, one day you'll find a hobby.

01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:14.717
You know, I think I already have.

01:31:20.304 --> 01:31:22.011
Bye-bye, paradise.

01:31:28.055 --> 01:31:29.049
No.

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:32.839
No!

01:31:40.514 --> 01:31:42.551
Max!

01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:45.086
No, you bastard!

01:31:50.764 --> 01:31:52.636
Last time, right, Max?

01:31:52.764 --> 01:31:54.340
Last time.

01:31:55.306 --> 01:31:57.261
You son of a bitch!

01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.632
Max!

01:32:00.306 --> 01:32:01.633
<i>If you want it, come and get it</i>

01:32:01.681 --> 01:32:02.676
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:02.806 --> 01:32:04.003
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:04.140 --> 01:32:05.965
<i>If you need it, come and get it</i>

01:32:06.098 --> 01:32:07.093
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:07.223 --> 01:32:08.218
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:08.348 --> 01:32:10.505
<i>If you want it, come and get it</i>

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:11.635
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:11.765 --> 01:32:12.760
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:14.798
<i>If you need it, come and get it</i>

01:32:14.932 --> 01:32:15.927
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:16.057 --> 01:32:17.052
<i>Ahh</i>

01:32:17.182 --> 01:32:19.505
<i>I'm a pro when it comes to the getaway</i>

01:32:19.641 --> 01:32:21.548
<i>So don't even try to follow me</i>

01:32:21.682 --> 01:32:23.508
<i>Bonnie and Clyde, me and my lady</i>

01:32:23.641 --> 01:32:26.011
<i>Right on down to the end of the story</i>

01:32:26.141 --> 01:32:28.179
<i>I'm wanted in so many countries</i>

01:32:28.308 --> 01:32:30.512
<i>Not even the feds can catch me</i>

01:32:30.641 --> 01:32:31.803
<i>'Cause I am made to run</i>

01:32:31.933 --> 01:32:34.504
<i>In this profession there is no other like me</i>

01:32:34.641 --> 01:32:36.679
<i>If you want it, come and get it</i>

01:32:36.808 --> 01:32:37.803

01:32:37.933 --> 01:32:38.928
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:39.058 --> 01:32:41.049
<i>If you need it, come and get it</i>

01:32:41.183 --> 01:32:42.178
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:42.309 --> 01:32:43.339
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:45.549
<i>If you want it, come and get it</i>

01:32:45.684 --> 01:32:46.679
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:46.809 --> 01:32:47.804
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:32:47.934 --> 01:32:49.806
<i>If you need it, come and get it</i>

01:32:49.934 --> 01:32:50.964
<i>I've got it</i>

01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:52.096
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:32:52.226 --> 01:32:54.430
<i>What you think you saw, you did not see</i>

01:32:54.559 --> 01:32:56.597
<i>'Cause it's so easy for me</i>

01:32:56.726 --> 01:32:58.930
<i>To get away from sharks and security</i>

01:32:59.059 --> 01:33:01.050
<i>I love to challenge my ability</i>

01:33:01.185 --> 01:33:03.341
<i>So never underestimate me</i>

01:33:03.476 --> 01:33:05.550
<i>I'm versatile with agility</i>

01:33:05.685 --> 01:33:07.841
<i>Don't you be surprised if you lose the prize</i>

01:33:07.977 --> 01:33:09.683
<i>'Cause I've done this before</i>

01:33:09.810 --> 01:33:11.682
<i>If you want it, come and get it</i>

01:33:11.810 --> 01:33:12.888
<i>I've got it</i>

01:33:13.019 --> 01:33:14.013
<i>Oh, whoa</i>

01:33:14.144 --> 01:33:15.969
<i>If you need it, come and get it</i>

01:33:16.102 --> 01:33:17.132
<i>I've got it</i>

01:33:17.269 --> 01:33:18.264
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

01:33:19.561 --> 01:33:20.674
<i>Yo</i>

01:33:20.811 --> 01:33:22.967
<i>To all the ladies in the dance</i>

01:33:23.102 --> 01:33:24.181
<i>To each and every princess</i>

01:33:24.311 --> 01:33:26.183
<i>Hey, ah, ha, ah</i>

01:33:26.311 --> 01:33:27.341
<i>Yo, confess</i>

01:33:27.478 --> 01:33:31.851
<i>I lose all control when I see you standing there in front of me</i>

01:33:31.978 --> 01:33:33.601
<i>Your style, your clothes, your hair</i>

01:33:33.728 --> 01:33:36.347
<i>Hey, woman, you look so sexy</i>

01:33:36.478 --> 01:33:38.268
<i>The way you wind and the way you dance</i>

01:33:38.395 --> 01:33:40.800
<i>And the way that you twist and turn your waist</i>

01:33:40.937 --> 01:33:43.058
<i>Leaves me wanting, leaves me yearning</i>

01:33:43.187 --> 01:33:45.261
<i>Leaves me feeling for a taste</i>

01:33:45.395 --> 01:33:49.768
<i>Before the end of the night</i>

01:33:49.895 --> 01:33:53.261
<i>I wanna hold you so tight</i>

01:33:53.396 --> 01:33:54.390
<i>So tight</i>

01:33:54.521 --> 01:33:57.851
<i>You know I want you so much</i>

01:33:57.979 --> 01:33:59.009
<i>So much</i>

01:33:59.146 --> 01:34:01.978
<i>And I'm so tempted to touch</i>

01:34:02.104 --> 01:34:03.301
<i>Yo, uh, uh</i>

01:34:03.438 --> 01:34:05.678
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:34:05.813 --> 01:34:07.804
<i>My little woman, man, I need you so much</i>

01:34:07.938 --> 01:34:10.178
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:34:10.313 --> 01:34:12.351
<i>My little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch</i>

01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:14.803
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:34:14.938 --> 01:34:17.013
<i>My little woman, man, I need you so much</i>

01:34:17.147 --> 01:34:19.303
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:34:19.439 --> 01:34:21.678
<i>My little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch</i>

01:34:22.981 --> 01:34:24.011
<i>Yo</i>

01:34:24.147 --> 01:34:26.185
<i>To all the ladies in the dance</i>

01:34:26.314 --> 01:34:27.511
<i>I'm lookin' at these ladies</i>

01:34:27.647 --> 01:34:30.646
<i>Thinkin' about one of them havin' my babies, huh</i>

01:34:30.773 --> 01:34:32.313
<i>I don't even know your name</i>

01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:35.354
<i>Little woman, I don't even know your age</i>

01:34:35.481 --> 01:34:36.974
<i>But there's somethin' about you, girl</i>

01:34:37.106 --> 01:34:38.978
<i>When I see you winding in front the stage</i>

01:34:39.106 --> 01:34:40.137
<i>I'm talkin' about you</i>

01:34:40.273 --> 01:34:41.683
<i>Please forgive me, please excuse me</i>

01:34:41.815 --> 01:34:43.224
<i>But there is nothing else that a man can do</i>

01:34:43.357 --> 01:34:44.351
<i>Excuse me</i>

01:34:44.482 --> 01:34:46.223
<i>I can't help myself, little woman</i>

01:34:46.357 --> 01:34:48.561
<i>I just need to be next to you</i>

01:34:48.690 --> 01:34:51.688
<i>Before the end of the night</i>

01:34:51.815 --> 01:34:53.143
<i>Before the end of the night, huh</i>

01:34:53.274 --> 01:34:56.640
<i>I wanna hold you so tight</i>

01:34:56.774 --> 01:34:57.804
<i>Wanna hold you</i>

01:34:57.941 --> 01:35:00.809
<i>You know I want you so much</i>

01:35:00.941 --> 01:35:02.138
<i>Want you so much, huh</i>

01:35:02.274 --> 01:35:05.640
<i>And I'm so tempted to touch</i>

01:35:05.775 --> 01:35:06.805
<i>Come on, huh</i>

01:35:06.941 --> 01:35:09.015
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:35:09.150 --> 01:35:11.224
<i>My little woman, man, I need you so much</i>

01:35:11.358 --> 01:35:13.598
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:35:13.733 --> 01:35:15.724
<i>My little woman, man, I'm inside your clutch</i>

01:35:15.858 --> 01:35:18.098
<i>Tempted to touch, tempted to touch</i>

01:35:18.233 --> 01:35:20.271
<i>My little woman, man, I need you so much</i>

01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.647
<i>Na na na-na-na-na na-na</i>

01:35:24.484 --> 01:35:28.348
<i>Na na na-na-na-na na-na</i>

01:35:28.484 --> 01:35:30.190
<i>Yeah</i>

01:35:30.317 --> 01:35:33.351
<i>She's got the touch I love so much</i>

01:35:33.484 --> 01:35:36.020
<i>That's all I ever wanted</i>

01:35:36.151 --> 01:35:39.019
<i>I'm surely God-blessed</i>

01:35:39.151 --> 01:35:43.062
<i>Uh. under her spell she had me crushed</i>

01:35:43.193 --> 01:35:45.646
<i>I sworn I was anointed</i>

01:35:45.777 --> 01:35:49.024
<i>Got caught by her magic</i>

01:35:49.152 --> 01:35:52.849
<i>Ah, she had me drooling for a while</i>

01:35:52.985 --> 01:35:54.857
<i>With her sexual motion</i>

01:35:54.985 --> 01:35:57.688
<i>Like taking candy from a child</i>

01:35:57.819 --> 01:35:59.726
<i>Suck on her love potion</i>

01:35:59.861 --> 01:36:03.024
<i>I can't believe the changes I've made</i>

01:36:03.153 --> 01:36:06.269
<i>Since I met my baby</i>

01:36:06.986 --> 01:36:10.518
<i>You know, she drive me crazy</i>

01:36:10.653 --> 01:36:12.146
<i>On and on</i>

01:36:12.278 --> 01:36:15.312
<i>What a beautiful lady</i>

01:36:15.445 --> 01:36:17.151
<i>On and on</i>

01:36:17.278 --> 01:36:20.193
<i>She drives me crazy</i>
