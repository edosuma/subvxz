00:11.245 --> 00:12.446
* ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR,
FIVE, SIX *

00:12.480 --> 00:13.447
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.481 --> 00:21.422

00:28.229 --> 00:29.597
* ONE, TWO, DO IT

00:29.630 --> 00:31.799

00:34.202 --> 00:36.070

[gasps of passion]

00:52.320 --> 00:55.256
[distant siren]

00:58.492 --> 01:03.264
- * LISTEN UP,
GONNA TELL YOU STRAIGHT *

01:03.297 --> 01:05.299
- YOU'RE BACK.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.435
[drops bags]
- YOU NOTICED.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.571
[both panting]

01:10.604 --> 01:14.308
- * YOU GET SMART,
OR YOU GET CAUGHT *

01:14.342 --> 01:18.078
* GOTTA ACCEPT IT

01:24.685 --> 01:26.320
- WHAT'S THAT?

01:26.354 --> 01:28.589
- OH, IT'S MOMO.

01:28.622 --> 01:32.593
TIBETAN FOR "DUMPLING,"
DUMPLING.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.695
- OH, IT'S...IT'S SPICY.

01:34.728 --> 01:38.132
OH-HO, COME ON, YOU SISSY.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.702
MY WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA TASTE
BUDS AREN'T USED TO...

01:41.735 --> 01:43.204
FAR EASTERN CUISINE.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.438
- WELL, IT IS GOOD FOR YOU.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.874
MAKES YOU SWEAT.
GETS ALL THE TOXINS OUT.

01:46.907 --> 01:50.678
MMM. I CAN THINK OF...

01:50.711 --> 01:52.446
OTHER WAYS
I'D RATHER SWEAT.

01:52.480 --> 01:56.750
both: MM.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.352
- NOW SEE, IT'S TOO HOT
FOR YOU NOW.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.221
- NO, NO, THE KISS WAS FINE.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.756
[inhales]

02:02.790 --> 02:04.458
- BEN?
- [exhales]

02:04.492 --> 02:06.827
JEEZ, MAYBE...MAYBE IT IS
A LITTLE TOO SPICY.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.763
I WAS...

02:09.797 --> 02:12.166
- WAIT, YOU DON'T DOUBLE OVER
FROM A DUMPLING.

02:12.200 --> 02:14.935
- NO, NO, NO, IT'S JUST...
FORGET IT, IT'S NOTHING.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.471
[sighs]

02:17.505 --> 02:19.640
SEE? THERE.

02:19.673 --> 02:23.244
IT'S ALL BETTER.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.545
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
EAT SOMETHING

02:24.578 --> 02:25.479
A LITTLE LESS EXOTIC.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.948
- OH, PLEASE, THE MONKS
IN THE MONASTERIES

02:27.981 --> 02:29.517
HAVE BEEN EATING IT
FOR CENTURIES.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.652
- YOU'RE NOT A MONK.
I CAN VOUCH FOR THAT.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.255
- NO, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO LIVE
THERE SOMEDAY.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.524
- WHAT? YOU DON'T GET
ENOUGH HOT MALE ACTION HERE?

02:36.557 --> 02:38.526
- [chuckling]

02:38.559 --> 02:40.728
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN:
STUDY BUDDHISM, MEDITATE.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.730
- YEAH. SEND ME A POSTCARD.

02:42.763 --> 02:44.832
- ARE YOU READY?

02:44.865 --> 02:45.933
[sniffs and clears throat]

02:45.966 --> 02:47.801
YEAH, I JUST GOTTA DO
ONE THING.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.803
[clears throat]

02:49.837 --> 02:51.505
HI, PASQUALE'S?

02:51.539 --> 02:53.541
YEAH, I'D LIKE
A LARGE PEPPERONI,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.409
DOUBLE CHEESE...

02:55.443 --> 02:57.545
- AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

02:57.578 --> 02:58.979
- GEORGE LEFT THE MONEY TO ME,

02:59.012 --> 03:00.848
IN MY NAME, IN MY ACCOUNT.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.716
HOW CAN THEY
JUST TAKE IT AWAY?

03:02.750 --> 03:04.852
- HAVING LOOKED AT THE JUDGE'S
TEMPORARY INJUNCTION,

03:04.885 --> 03:06.920
IT IS MY CONSIDERED OPINION
THAT...

03:06.954 --> 03:07.921
YOU'RE SCREWED.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.357
- EXCUSE ME?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.592
- IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE
VAGUE LEGAL TERMS

03:11.625 --> 03:13.627
THAT LAWYERS USE
TO COVER THEIR ASSES.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.363
WHAT EXACTLY DO YOU MEAN
BY "SCREWED"?

03:15.396 --> 03:17.498
- UH, PERMIT ME TO CLARIFY.
"FUCKED."

03:17.531 --> 03:19.433
THE SCHICKEL FAMILY ATTORNEYS

03:19.467 --> 03:21.335
ARE GOING TO DO EVERYTHING
IN THEIR POWER TO PROVE THAT YOU

03:21.369 --> 03:23.604
MANIPULATED GEORGE
INTO GIVING YOU THAT MONEY.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.605
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.707
- HONEY, THE TRUTH HAS
AS MUCH TO DO WITH LAW

03:26.740 --> 03:28.809
AS GAY MEN HAVE TO DO
WITH LESBIANS.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.544
- PRESENT COMPANY EXCEPTED,
OF COURSE.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.780
- THEY'RE GOING TO SAY YOU
ORCHESTRATED THE WHOLE THING.

03:32.813 --> 03:33.681
- EMMETT CAN'T PLAY

03:33.714 --> 03:35.816
MARY HAD A LITTLE LAMB
ON A KAZOO.

03:35.849 --> 03:36.984
HOW'S HE GOING TO ORCHESTRATE
FINAGLING GEORGE

03:37.017 --> 03:38.252
OUT OF MILLIONS?

03:38.286 --> 03:41.722
- BY PLAYING UPON THE DIMINISHED
CAPACITIES OF A LONELY OLD MAN.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.324
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
HE SHOULD JUST GIVE UP?

03:43.357 --> 03:45.626
FORGET ABOUT THE MONEY?
- FUCK THAT!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.595
THAT 10 MILLION BELONGED
TO EMMETT.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.597
- AND--AND WHAT ABOUT THE GIFTS
I BOUGHT YOU?

03:49.630 --> 03:51.432
YOUR CAR, YOUR SEATS
AT THE OPERA,

03:51.465 --> 03:54.502
YOUR...DIAMOND BRACELET?

03:54.535 --> 03:55.936
- THEY'LL HAVE TO CUT OFF
MY ARM FIRST.

03:55.969 --> 03:57.471
- I'M SURE THEY'D BE
DELIGHTED.

03:57.505 --> 03:58.972
AND THEN SEND YOU THE BILL.

03:59.006 --> 04:01.409
- HEY, YOUR ORDER'S UP!

04:01.442 --> 04:02.676
- THANKS. COMING.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.880
- FRAWLEY'S OPEN FIRE.
I-I...

04:06.914 --> 04:07.915
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
WE WERE GOING

04:07.948 --> 04:09.417
FOR THE HIGH-END ACCOUNTS.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.352
THIS ISN'T EVEN LOW-END,
IT'S BACK-END.

04:11.385 --> 04:13.354
- THEY'VE GOT 1,200 STEAK HOUSES

04:13.387 --> 04:14.988
THROUGHOUT THE MIDWEST
AND THE SOUTH.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.557
1,200.
- [scoffs]

04:16.590 --> 04:17.891
YEAH, WHAT ABOUT THIS NAME,
OPEN FIRE?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.960
WHAT DO YOU DO? SHOOT THE COW,
THEN EAT IT?

04:19.993 --> 04:21.429
- THEY ARE TRYING

04:21.462 --> 04:23.497
TO CHANGE THEIR IMAGE.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.634
- AH. HOW ABOUT THIS?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.536
"GO OUT OF BUSINESS."

04:28.569 --> 04:30.671
OH, WE DON'T TELL
POTENTIAL CLIENTS

04:30.704 --> 04:31.839
TO TAKE A HIKE.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
HMM, NOT IN THIS MARKET.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.809
AND NOT WITH WHAT YOU'RE
MAKING...

04:35.843 --> 04:37.645
PARTNER.
- [chuckles]

04:37.678 --> 04:38.812
HOW LONG DO I HAVE?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.048
UH...TOMORROW.
- WHAT?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.916
- COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.653
YOU'RE THE MIRACLE WORKER.

04:45.686 --> 04:47.588
- THIS WILL TAKE MORE
THAN A MIRACLE.

04:47.621 --> 04:51.058
IT'LL TAKE
DIVINE INTERVENTION.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.660
- EVERY NIGHT I WOULD GO BACK
TO THE ROOM,

04:52.693 --> 04:54.662
HOPING THAT HE'D SURPRISE ME
AND SHOW UP.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.898
HE NEVER DID.
HE NEVER EVEN CALLED.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.468
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN PISSED.
I MEAN...

05:00.501 --> 05:01.569
JUST TAKING OFF LIKE THAT.

05:01.602 --> 05:02.936
YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL HIM
YOU WERE GOING.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.938
- I NEVER SAID I WASN'T GOING.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.574
HE'S THE ONE WHO CANCELLED
ON ME.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.075
- NOW YOU KNOW
HOW OUR MOMS FEEL

05:08.108 --> 05:09.643
WHEN OUR DADS CALL
FROM THE OFFICE:

05:09.677 --> 05:12.112
"OH, SORRY, HONEY,
CAN'T MAKE IT."

05:12.145 --> 05:14.081
- I'M NOT SOME GODDAMNED
HOUSEWIFE.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.050
[violin plays
upbeat music]

05:17.084 --> 05:20.421
- THAT GUY'S PRETTY GOOD.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.589
- YEAH, HE GOES
TO MY SCHOOL.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.791
I SAW HIM PLAY ONCE.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.927
[coins jingle, drop]
- THANK YOU.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.863
- LOOK AT HIS EYES.
WOW.

05:29.897 --> 05:32.800
ANYWAYS, GOTTA GO
TO BIOLOGY.

05:32.833 --> 05:38.872
*

05:42.543 --> 05:45.513
- VERY GOOD.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.597
[applause]
- BRAVO!

06:03.631 --> 06:05.933
- CONSIDERED BY MANY TO BE ONE
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECES

06:05.966 --> 06:07.968
EVER WRITTEN
FOR THE STRINGS.

06:08.001 --> 06:08.936
THANK YOU.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.738
- WHY ARE YOU PLAYING IT
ON A STREET CORNER?

06:10.771 --> 06:13.541
- I NEED THE CASH.

06:13.574 --> 06:16.610
- THERE'S GOTTA BE AN
EASIER WAY.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.546
- WELL, YEAH, I GUESS I COULD
ALWAYS BE A GO-GO BOY.

06:18.579 --> 06:19.947
[humming]

06:19.980 --> 06:21.982
- I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THAT.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
- THEN I'LL STICK
TO THE FIDDLE.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.085
- YOU ARE PRETTY GOOD.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.154
- [chuckles]
PRETTY GOOD?

06:27.187 --> 06:29.490
I'M A GENIUS.

06:29.523 --> 06:30.824
- YOU'RE ALSO NOT VERY MODEST.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.192
- WELL, THEY'VE ONLY BEEN
TELLING ME THAT

06:32.225 --> 06:33.994
SINCE I WAS SIX,
SO, UH,

06:34.027 --> 06:37.064
SOONER OR LATER, I WAS BOUND
TO BELIEVE IT.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.032
80 BUCKS.
NOT TOO BAD.

06:39.066 --> 06:43.737
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING IT'S NOT
REALLY ME PLAYING.

06:50.043 --> 06:51.779
IT COMES THROUGH ME,

06:51.812 --> 06:54.915
FROM SOMEPLACE ELSE.

06:54.948 --> 06:57.184
- IT'S AMAZING
THAT YOU SAID THAT.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.988
WHEN I DRAW,
IT FEELS THE SAME WAY.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.756
- HEY, CHECK IT OUT.

07:02.790 --> 07:03.757
- THE GARBAGE TRUCK?

07:03.791 --> 07:05.593
- NO, NO, NO,
THE COUCH.

07:05.626 --> 07:07.194
- IT'S A PIECE OF SHIT.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.663
- YEAH?

07:09.697 --> 07:10.998
WELL, ONE MAN'S PIECE OF SHIT

07:11.031 --> 07:12.666
IS ANOTHER MAN'S LIVING ROOM.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.935
COME ON.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.637
HEY!

07:16.670 --> 07:19.673
HEY, GUYS WITH THE COUCH?
HEY, LISTEN.

07:19.707 --> 07:20.974
- TONY, THESE GUYS WANT
TO BUY THIS.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.876
- LET ME TAKE THIS COUCH
OFF YOUR HANDS, HUH?

07:22.910 --> 07:23.877
HOW ABOUT IT?

07:23.911 --> 07:28.616
THANKS.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.884
- YOU LIVE CLOSE?
- YEAH.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.554
- DID YOU RECEIVE
MY LITTLE GIFT?

07:33.587 --> 07:36.490
YOU ALWAYS SAY,
"FUCK 'EM ALL."

07:36.524 --> 07:41.228
WELL, TO DO THAT, YOU'VE GOT
TO HAVE "FUCK 'EM ALL" MONEY.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.997
- VERY INTERESTING VIDEO.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.799
- I'D GIVE IT FOUR STARS.

07:45.833 --> 07:47.768
- GOOD CAMERA WORK.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.237
EXCELLENT SOUND QUALITY.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.872
HOWEVER,

07:51.905 --> 07:54.708
I DIDN'T FIND
MR. SCHICKEL'S PERFORMANCE

07:54.742 --> 07:56.844
PARTICULARLY CONVINCING.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.211
- PERFORMANCE?

07:58.245 --> 08:00.113
GEORGE MEANT EVERY WORD
HE SAID.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.883
- EVERY WORD HE WAS TOLD
TO SAY.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.953
- GEORGE SCHICKEL WAS NOT
COERCED INTO MAKING THIS TAPE.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.888
IT'S QUITE CLEAR
HE WAS OF SOUND MIND.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.557
- AND SOUND BODY, TOO.

08:09.590 --> 08:10.691
- WHAT'S CLEAR

08:10.724 --> 08:12.860
IS THAT GEORGE SCHICKEL
WAS A CONFUSED

08:12.893 --> 08:14.995
AND LONELY OLD MAN,

08:15.028 --> 08:18.131
WHO WAS SEDUCED
BY THE SEXUAL ADVANCES

08:18.165 --> 08:19.933
OF AN AMBITIOUS YOUNG HUSTLER

08:19.967 --> 08:21.735
HE MET ON A PORN SITE.

08:21.769 --> 08:24.271
- HEY, I LOVED GEORGE.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.806
AND HE LOVED ME.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.975
- THEN WHY DID YOU
PERSUADE HIM

08:28.008 --> 08:30.911
TO TAKE YOU
ON A ROUND-THE-WORLD TOUR,

08:30.944 --> 08:33.080
KNOWING IT WOULD
ENDANGER HIS HEALTH?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.782
- I D--
I DIDN'T FORCE--

08:34.815 --> 08:36.083
HE'S THE ONE
WHO WANTED TO GO.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.853
- BUT, BEFORE YOU LEFT,
YOU CONVINCED HIM

08:39.887 --> 08:44.057
TO DEPOSIT $10 MILLION
INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT,

08:44.091 --> 08:47.695
IN CASE SOMETHING
SHOULD HAPPEN?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.697
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE

08:49.730 --> 08:52.900
A JUDGE AND JURY
WILL THINK OTHERWISE,

08:52.933 --> 08:54.201
ONCE THEY VIEW THIS?

08:54.234 --> 08:56.136
- I CAN'T ANSWER THAT,

08:56.169 --> 08:59.039
SINCE I DON'T PLAN ON
PRESENTING IT AS COURT EVIDENCE.

08:59.072 --> 09:02.843
I INTEND TO RELEASE IT
TO THE PRESS.

09:02.876 --> 09:03.944
SO THAT PEOPLE WILL SEE

09:03.977 --> 09:06.046
THAT MR. HONEYCUTT
IS BEING DENIED

09:06.079 --> 09:07.715
THE RECOGNITION
AND THE LEGACY

09:07.748 --> 09:09.950
OF A LEGITIMATE,
LOVING RELATIONSHIP.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.085
BUT, WHATEVER THE OUTCOME,

09:12.119 --> 09:14.221
ONCE THE PUBLIC
TAKES A LOOK AT THIS--

09:14.254 --> 09:15.923
[laughs]

09:15.956 --> 09:17.858
THEY'LL NEVER THINK
OF A SCHICKEL'S PICKLE

09:17.891 --> 09:19.292
IN THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

09:23.831 --> 09:26.066
- WALTER HORATIO PATER,

09:26.099 --> 09:28.201
THE ENGLISH ESSAYIST
AND CRITIC,

09:28.235 --> 09:30.337
WAS PERHAPS
THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PROPONENT

09:30.370 --> 09:32.673
OF VICTORIAN AESTHETICISM.

09:32.706 --> 09:36.243
THAT'S THE PHILOSOPHY THAT
TEACHES "ART FOR ART'S SAKE."

09:36.276 --> 09:39.713
NOW, HE BELIEVED THAT
PLEASURE DERIVED FROM BEAUTY

09:39.747 --> 09:43.784
IS THE HIGHEST IDEAL
TO WHICH MAN CAN ASPIRE.

09:43.817 --> 09:46.720
NOW, HIS MOST FAMOUS
DISCIPLE WAS OSCAR WILDE--

09:46.754 --> 09:49.156
[gasping]

09:49.189 --> 09:50.691
- MR.--MR. BRUCKNER,

09:50.724 --> 09:54.962
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

09:54.995 --> 09:57.931

09:57.965 --> 10:00.000
THANK YOU.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.002
OKAY, UH--

10:07.841 --> 10:10.878
WILDE CHOSE
TO PURSUE PASSION,

10:10.911 --> 10:12.980
TO SEIZE THE MOMENT

10:13.013 --> 10:15.816
WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONSEQUENCE.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.386
[breathing heavily]

10:19.419 --> 10:21.989
"TO BURN ALWAYS
WITH THIS GEM-LIKE FLAME,

10:22.022 --> 10:24.391
TO MAINTAIN
THIS ECSTASY"--

10:24.424 --> 10:25.926
[gasping]

10:25.959 --> 10:28.261
[students murmuring]

10:28.295 --> 10:30.063
- MR. BRUCKNER.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.666
MR. BRUCKNER,
ARE YOU OKAY?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.936
SOMEBODY GET A DOCTOR.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.271
GET A DOCTOR!

10:38.305 --> 10:40.140
- [panting]
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

10:40.173 --> 10:41.374
YOU LIVED
ON THE TOP FLOOR?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.976
- [laughs]
WELL, IF I HAD,

10:43.010 --> 10:44.978
YOU WOULD
NOT HAVE HELPED ME.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.046
- YEAH.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.049
[both struggling]

10:53.486 --> 10:57.290
[both sighing]

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
THIS IS A REALLY COOL PLACE.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.328
- THANKS.
UM--

11:01.361 --> 11:04.031
I FOUND PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING
IN IT ON THE STREET,

11:04.064 --> 11:06.433
INCLUDING WOLFRAM.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.435
- WOLFRAM?

11:08.468 --> 11:09.970
IS HE YOUR BOYFRIEND?

11:10.003 --> 11:11.772
- YEAH.
YOU WANT TO MEET HIM?

11:11.805 --> 11:13.040
- YEAH.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.876
- SAY HELLO
TO WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.378
- [laughs, squeals]

11:18.411 --> 11:19.379
[cat meowing]

11:19.412 --> 11:21.014
WOLFRAM.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.951
- HE'S CONSIDERED BY MANY
TO BE GERMANY'S GREATEST POET.

11:23.984 --> 11:27.120
- THAT'S AN AWFULLY FANCY NAME
FOR A PUSSY.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.122
[laughs]

11:29.156 --> 11:31.291
- WAGNER USED HIS
MOST FAMOUS EPIC, PARZIVAL,

11:31.324 --> 11:32.993
AS THE BASIS FOR HIS OPERA.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.062
- OH.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.798
I WISH I HAD A CAT LIKE YOU.

11:37.831 --> 11:38.966

11:38.999 --> 11:40.500

11:40.533 --> 11:43.070
MY BOYFRIEND WOULD
HAVE A SHIT FIT.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.273
- MM, THE ONE WHO DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN BIRTHDAYS?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.174
- HE'S GOT AN AMAZING LOFT,

11:47.207 --> 11:49.910
RIGHT OUT
OF ARCHITECTURAL DIGEST.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.812
EVERYTHING IN IT IS ITALIAN.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.946
IT COSTS A FORTUNE.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.815
- OBVIOUSLY, HE'S NOT
ON SCHOLARSHIP.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.950
- NO, HE'S 31.

11:56.984 --> 11:58.085
HE'S GOT A GREAT JOB.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.521
- OH.
AN OLDER MAN.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.291
- BETTER NOT LET HIM
HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

12:04.324 --> 12:06.760
- SO YOU GUYS LIVE TOGETHER?

12:06.794 --> 12:10.831
- YEAH.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.433
- WELL, LUCKY HIM.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.002
HE'S GOT A GREAT JOB,

12:15.035 --> 12:21.008
A GREAT PLACE
FULL OF BEAUTIFUL THINGS.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.275
- [snorts]
YOU--

12:29.482 --> 12:32.552
I SHOULD GO.
I HAVE A CLASS.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.187
ALL RIGHT.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.456
[clears throat]

12:36.489 --> 12:39.126
- YEAH, I HAVE TO,
UH--

12:39.159 --> 12:41.094
I HAVE TO PRACTICE, PRACTICE,
PRACTICE.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.563
- ALL RIGHT.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.232
[yawns]

12:45.265 --> 12:46.399
- BUT THANKS
FOR HELPING ME OUT.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.002
I'LL--I'LL--
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND?

12:49.036 --> 12:51.905
- UH...

12:51.939 --> 12:53.841
I HAVE SOME STUFF
IN THE STUDENT ART FAIR,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.143
IF YOU HAVE TIME.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.816
OKAY.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.419
[cat meowing]

13:06.453 --> 13:07.420
- HE SAID
I WAS NOTHING MORE

13:07.454 --> 13:10.523
THAN A HUSTLER,
A TRAMP.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.225
- THOSE LYING SONS
OF BITCHES.

13:12.259 --> 13:14.294
YOU'RE AN AWARD WINNER.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.428
- WELL, NOT TO WORRY.

13:15.462 --> 13:16.463
IF ANYBODY CAN
CHEW THEIR BALLS OFF

13:16.496 --> 13:17.931
AND SPIT THEM OUT,
IT'S MELANIE.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.432
- SHE, UH,
SHE TOLD THEM

13:19.466 --> 13:22.435
SHE'S GOING TO RELEASE
GEORGE'S VIDEO TO THE PRESS.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.403
- BRILLIANT.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.939
- WELL, THAT SHOULD
CREATE QUITE A SCANDAL.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.574
- A SCANDAL?
- YEAH.

13:27.607 --> 13:29.509
I MEAN, YOU THINK
A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY

13:29.542 --> 13:31.278
LIKE SCHICKEL'S PICKLES
WANTS EVERY GUY

13:31.311 --> 13:33.180
WHO BUYS A FRANK WITH RELISH
AT A BASEBALL GAME,

13:33.213 --> 13:34.581
EVERY KID AT A PICNIC,

13:34.614 --> 13:36.249
EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN
WITH A SUDDEN CRAVING

13:36.283 --> 13:37.617
KNOWING ABOUT YOU AND GEORGE?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.419
[phone ringing]

13:39.452 --> 13:41.588
THAT MONEY
IS PRACTICALLY YOURS.

13:41.621 --> 13:45.625
I SAY WE GO GET SOME DINNER,
CELEBRATE.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.060
- YEAH.
AS SOON AS BEN GETS HERE.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.595
HELLO?

13:48.628 --> 13:52.432
YES.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.167

IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY?

13:54.201 --> 13:55.168
- YEAH.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.469
- YEAH.
LET'S GO.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.207

14:00.240 --> 14:01.909
SO, WHATCHA

14:01.942 --> 14:04.477
STEAK OR LOBSTER?

14:04.511 --> 14:06.179
- MICHAEL?

14:09.316 --> 14:14.087
[door opening and closing]

14:14.121 --> 14:17.590
- YOU'RE HOME LATE.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.359
- I GOT A NEW ACCOUNT.

14:19.392 --> 14:24.932
- THAT'S NICE.

14:24.965 --> 14:28.135
HOW WAS YOUR DAY,
JUSTIN?

14:28.168 --> 14:31.972
- FUCKING ONE DAY
TO DO A PRESENTATION.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.974
- IT WAS NOT BAD.
THANKS FOR ASKING.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.376
HOW WAS YOURS?

14:36.409 --> 14:41.915
[deep voice] WHOLE LOT BETTER
NOW THAT I'M WITH YOU.

14:41.949 --> 14:45.118
- A FUCKING STEAK HOUSE.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.287
AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO BE BRILLIANT.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.390
- DID YOU MISS ME?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.959
[scoffs]

14:51.992 --> 14:53.660
"EVERY MINUTE
YOU WERE AWAY.

14:53.693 --> 14:55.262
"YOU'RE ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT.

14:55.295 --> 14:58.398
PLEASE NEVER LEAVE ME AGAIN."

14:58.431 --> 15:00.233
- WHO THE FUCK
ARE YOU TALKING TO?

15:00.267 --> 15:02.235
- NO ONE.

15:02.269 --> 15:05.205
- AND WHAT'S
WITH THE LITTLE VOICE?

15:09.042 --> 15:13.546
ARE YOU PLANNING
TO BECOME A VENTRILOQUIST?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.148
- IT'S ONE WAY TO HEAR
WHAT YOU WANT.

15:15.182 --> 15:19.686
- MM.

15:19.719 --> 15:25.358
SO HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

15:25.392 --> 15:29.029
- NOT MUCH FUN WITHOUT YOU.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.730
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE GOING?

15:30.763 --> 15:36.236
- I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D CARE.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.138
- THERE WERE THINGS
I HAD TO DO.

15:43.476 --> 15:45.012
- DID YOU MISS ME?

15:54.221 --> 15:59.092
- [sighs]

15:59.126 --> 16:00.427
- * HOLD ME NOW

16:00.460 --> 16:03.596
* AN EAST WIND
FROM YOUR EYES *

16:03.630 --> 16:07.067
* SURROUNDS ME

16:07.100 --> 16:09.069
* CAN'T GO AWAY

16:09.102 --> 16:11.238
* TOO HARD
TO SAY *

16:11.271 --> 16:14.407
* THAT WE'RE NOT TRYING

16:14.441 --> 16:17.744
* AND HOW CAN THE PAST

16:17.777 --> 16:20.780
* JUST SNEAK UP
FROM BEHIND *

16:20.813 --> 16:25.352
* WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER?

16:25.385 --> 16:29.022
* TOGETHER

16:29.056 --> 16:31.024
* IN MY ARMS

16:31.058 --> 16:33.493
* WHAT YOU FIND

16:33.526 --> 16:36.696
* IS WHAT YOU CANNOT HAVE

16:36.729 --> 16:38.631
* IN MY ARMS

16:38.665 --> 16:40.567
* YOU'VE BEEN WANTING

16:40.600 --> 16:42.169
* YOU'VE BEEN WAITING

16:46.606 --> 16:48.775
- BEN, YOU OKAY?

16:48.808 --> 16:53.012
- [labored breathing]

16:57.417 --> 16:59.052
- WHAT'S WRONG
WITH HIM, DOCTOR?

16:59.086 --> 17:00.387
- ACUTE PANCREATITIS.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.689
PROBABLY HAS TO DO
WITH HIS HIV REGIMEN.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.124
- WELL,
HIS VIRAL LOAD WAS UP,

17:04.157 --> 17:05.425
AND HIS--HIS T-CELLS
WERE DOWN.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.394
THAT'S WHY HIS DOCTOR CHANGED
HIS MEDICATION.

17:07.427 --> 17:10.830
- WELL, HE APPEARS TO HAVE HAD
A NEAR-FATAL REACTION.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.233
- WELL, IS HE GOING TO BE
OKAY?

17:13.266 --> 17:15.235
- IT DEPENDS IF WE CAN GET HIS
ENZYME ELEVATION BACK DOWN.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.070
RIGHT NOW,
IT'S EXTREMELY HIGH.

17:17.104 --> 17:19.306
- WELL, HOW LONG
BEFORE YOU KNOW?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.408
- THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.344
WE'LL KEEP HIM ON I.V.,
NORMAL SALINE, AND OFF HIS MEDS.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.345
WE'LL SEE
HOW HE DOES.

17:25.378 --> 17:28.615
- THANKS, DOCTOR.
UM...

17:28.648 --> 17:31.451
IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD STAY
WITH HIM TONIGHT?

17:31.484 --> 17:34.421
- ARE YOU A FAMILY MEMBER?

17:34.454 --> 17:37.724
- I'M HIS LOVER.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.859
- I'LL HAVE AN ATTENDANT BRING
YOU A BLANKET AND A PILLOW.

17:39.892 --> 17:42.229
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.135
- OKAY, I'LL, UH,
I'LL MAKE HIS MEALS.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.336
- SINCE WHEN DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO COOK?

17:49.369 --> 17:50.570
- UH, WE'LL MAKE THE MEALS.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.838
- WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON
AT YOUR HOUSE?

17:51.871 --> 17:53.506
- WHAT?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.275
- WITH THE RENOVATIONS
AND ALL.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.310
LOOK, I'LL JUST
ORDER THE MEALS.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.180
- UH, THEN, UM, I'LL LOOK, UH,
AFTER THE SHOP.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.881
- YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT COMIC BOOKS.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.883
I'M FAMILIAR WITH PRACTICALLY
HIS ENTIRE INVENTORY.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.252
I'LL LOOK AFTER THE STORE.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.453
- OKAY, THEN, UH,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:06.486 --> 18:08.721
I WILL, UH, I WILL PACK HIM
A NICE LITTLE OVERNIGHT BAG

18:08.755 --> 18:09.656
WITH SOME OF HIS THINGS.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.891
UM, RAZOR, TOOTHPASTE,
CHANGE OF UNDIES.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.793
- DID IT.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.330
- THEN HOW ABOUT FABULOUS
FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS

18:17.364 --> 18:18.831
SENT TO BEN'S ROOM DAILY?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.500
- WHAT THE FUCK DOES HE WANT
WITH FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS?

18:20.533 --> 18:21.568
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

18:21.601 --> 18:26.306
- OKAY, WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING I CAN DO.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.907
- BOIL WATER.
- HE'S NOT PREGNANT.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.677
- I WANT SOME COFFEE.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.478
- HEY.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.746
- POOR BABY,
YOU LOOK EXHAUSTED.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.915
- MICHAEL,
HOW'S BEN'S FEVER?

18:35.948 --> 18:37.750
- IS BEN ALL RIGHT?
- DID THE DOCTOR SAY ANYTHING?

18:37.784 --> 18:39.219
- IS HE GOING TO BE OKAY?

18:39.252 --> 18:40.620
- THEY DON'T KNOW.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.621
- SWEETIE, COME--
COME SIT DOWN.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.622
I'LL MAKE YOU SOME COFFEE.

18:42.655 --> 18:43.623
- I HAVEN'T GOT TIME.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.791
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE HOSPITAL.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.359
- UH, HON--
HONEY--

18:46.393 --> 18:47.627
[door closes]

19:00.307 --> 19:01.874
- YOUR ROOM IS A SHIT HOLE.

19:01.908 --> 19:05.245
- I CAN'T FIND MY BLACK JEANS.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.613
- THEY'RE IN YOUR HAND.

19:11.718 --> 19:12.785
DID YOU CALL YOUR MOM?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.521
- NO.

19:14.554 --> 19:17.257
I CALLED VIC.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.526
- WELL, DON'T YOU THINK--

19:19.559 --> 19:22.395
- NO, I DON'T THINK.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.696
SHE'D JUST GIVE ME SHIT.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.465
I DON'T NEED A BUNCH OF SHIT
RIGHT NOW.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.937
- YOU SHOULD TAKE A NAP.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.306
- I CAN'T.

19:33.340 --> 19:37.277
I--
WHERE'S MY BLUE SHIRT?

19:37.310 --> 19:38.245
- YOU'RE WEARING IT.

19:50.590 --> 19:54.961
HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE BRAVE
ON ACCOUNT OF ME.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.297
- ON ACCOUNT OF YOU?
WHO'S--

19:57.330 --> 19:58.698
WHO THE HELL'S THINKING
ABOUT YOU?

19:58.731 --> 20:01.668
I'M THINKING ABOUT BEN.

20:01.701 --> 20:05.605
HE COULD DIE.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.407
- THEN YOU SHOULD
LET US HELP YOU.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.276
- I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

20:09.309 --> 20:14.714
I CAN DO IT MYSELF.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.450
- YOU REALLY OUGHT
TO SAVE THE HERO SHIT

20:17.484 --> 20:21.454
FOR THE GODDAMN COMIC BOOKS.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.456
- IT'S NOT HERO SHIT.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.358
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,

20:25.392 --> 20:27.527
AND BEN,
AND I DON'T NEED YOU

20:27.560 --> 20:31.331
OR ANYONE ELSE COMING
TO RESCUE ME.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.700
I'M DOING JUST FINE.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.336
- GOOD FOR YOU.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.538
- NOW WHAT THE HELL DID I DO
WITH MY WALLET?

20:46.346 --> 20:48.315
- YOUR STUFF IS
BY FAR THE BEST.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.749
- YOU'RE JUST SAYING THAT
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS,

20:49.782 --> 20:50.950
AND BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
SHIT ABOUT ART.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.819
- NOW, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.621
STOP BEING
SUCH A DEFENSIVE ASSHOLE

20:54.654 --> 20:56.289
AND TAKE THE COMPLIMENT.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.359
- SHE'S RIGHT.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.794
YOUR STUFF IS THE BEST,
SO ADMIT IT, YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.497
- [scoffs]
I'M BRILLIANT.

21:04.531 --> 21:08.335
- GOOD.
THAT'S BETTER.

21:08.368 --> 21:11.304
- THAT'S THE GUY
WHO WAS PLAYING THE VIOLIN.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.540
- REALLY?
- [scoffs]

21:13.573 --> 21:14.541
YOU KNOW, FOR AN ARTIST,

21:14.574 --> 21:16.275
YOU SURE DON'T SEE VERY WELL.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.817
- WHO'S SHE?

21:24.851 --> 21:26.919
- SHE'S A FRIEND
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.888
- HOW MUCH YOU WANT
FOR THIS ONE?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.523
- MM, THREE.

21:30.557 --> 21:33.059
- HUNDRED?
- MILLION.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.494
YOU SAID I WAS BRILLIANT.

21:34.527 --> 21:35.562
THEN YOU'RE SELLING
YOURSELF SHORT.

21:35.595 --> 21:36.563
ASK FOR FIVE.

21:36.596 --> 21:39.632
- FIVE.
- SOLD.

21:39.666 --> 21:42.001
- IT'S YOURS.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.671
FOR A SONG.

21:48.107 --> 21:52.579
- YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.581
WHY DON'T YOU COME OVER LATER
AND COLLECT IT?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.428
- GOT IT. TWO SCRAMBLED,
TWO BACON, ONE SAUSAGE.

22:08.461 --> 22:09.929
BROWN TOAST.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.565
HOW ABOUT A SMILE, DEB?

22:12.599 --> 22:14.000
- HEY, HONEY.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.368
DON'T COUNT ON ME
FOR DINNER, ALL RIGHT?

22:15.402 --> 22:16.603
I'M TAKING OVER
BETTY'S SHIFT.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.104
IT'S A DAMN GOOD THING
WE GOT OUR FLU SHOTS,

22:18.137 --> 22:19.472
'CAUSE EVERYBODY'S SICK.

22:19.506 --> 22:22.609
- BEN'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

22:22.642 --> 22:23.676
- WHAT?

22:28.715 --> 22:31.083
JESUS.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.118
IS IT...

22:32.151 --> 22:34.086
- PANCREATITIS.

22:34.120 --> 22:36.723
- FROM THE MEDS.
PROBABLY THE VIDEX.

22:36.756 --> 22:39.726
- THAT'D BE MY GUESS.

22:39.759 --> 22:40.793
- HOW'S HE DOING?

22:40.827 --> 22:42.161
- MICHAEL SAYS NOT SO GOOD.

22:42.194 --> 22:45.532
- WHEN DID HE CALL?
- LAST NIGHT.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.734
- HEY, WHEN THE HELL WERE
YOU PLANNING ON TELLING ME?

22:47.767 --> 22:49.636
- HE DIDN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.905
- I'M HIS GODDAMN MOTHER,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.411
IS MY SON ALL RIGHT?

22:58.445 --> 23:00.012
- HE'S PUTTING UP
A BRAVE FRONT,

23:00.046 --> 23:01.681
BUT IT'S TOUGH.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.682
[bell ringing]

23:02.715 --> 23:05.051
- DEB, YOUR EGGS ARE UP.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.027
- I TOLD HIM THIS WOULD HAPPEN,
DIDN'T I?

23:15.061 --> 23:16.028
I TOLD HIM.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.096
- RIGHT AGAIN.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.965
CONGRATULATIONS.

23:25.705 --> 23:27.707
- [on PA] DR. LAO,
REPORT TO NURSES' STATION,

23:27.740 --> 23:28.875
SECOND FLOOR.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.844
DR. LAO, NURSES' STATION,
SECOND FLOOR.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.547
- HI, CUTIE.

23:34.581 --> 23:36.783
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

23:36.816 --> 23:38.417
- WONDERFUL.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.791
- YOU LOOK SO SEXY
IN YOUR LITTLE GOWN.

23:44.824 --> 23:47.727
- [snorts]

23:47.760 --> 23:48.928
- YOU WANT SOME CRUSHED ICE?

23:48.961 --> 23:53.733
THEY SAID IT WOULD HELP
WITH THE FEVER.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.504
- MM.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.907
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D END UP
HERE SO SOON.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.509
- YOU HAVEN'T "ENDED UP HERE."

24:02.542 --> 24:03.543
YOU'LL BE OUT
IN A DAY OR TWO.

24:03.576 --> 24:04.544
- [laughs]

24:04.577 --> 24:06.212
I'VE SEEN WHAT HAPPENS.

24:06.245 --> 24:11.083
FROM NOW ON, IT'S BACK
AND FORTH, TRIP AFTER TRIP.

24:11.117 --> 24:12.952
- THE ONLY TRIP
YOU'LL BE TAKING

24:12.985 --> 24:14.821
IS TO TIBET.

24:14.854 --> 24:16.856
I'VE ALREADY BOOKED US
INTO THE KATHMANDU HILTON.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.625
THEY'VE--THEY'VE GOT THIS
GREAT PACKAGE DEAL.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.793
IT'S 10 BUCKS A DAY,
AND ALL THE YAK YOU CAN EAT.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.595
- OH, DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

24:37.944 --> 24:39.646
- TIME FOR HIS MEDICATION.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.113
- WAIT, CAN YOU COME BACK
A LITTLE LATER?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.114
HE--HE JUST FELL ASLEEP.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.250
- SORRY.
MR. BRUCKNER?

24:44.283 --> 24:45.852
- HE NEEDS HIS REST.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.688
- AND I HAVE MY ORDERS.
HE'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.690
- WHAT IS IT?
- HIS HIV MEDICATION.

24:50.723 --> 24:51.858
- WAIT.
WHO PRESCRIBED IT?

24:51.891 --> 24:52.992
- THE DOCTOR ON CALL.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.193
- WELL, THE DOCTOR
WHO ADMITTED HIM

24:54.226 --> 24:55.762
SAID HE WANTED HIM
OFF ALL MEDICATION.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.797
TH--THIS IS WHAT PRACTICALLY
KILLED HIM.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.999
- LOOK, I DON'T TAKE
MY ORDERS FROM YOU, OKAY?

25:00.032 --> 25:01.100
- THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.269
IF YOU GIVE HIM THIS,
HE'LL DIE.

25:03.302 --> 25:06.806
- I'M GETTING A DOCTOR.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.775
- WELL, WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T YOU GET A BRAIN?

25:15.815 --> 25:18.117
- THEY ARRIVED FROM LOUISVILLE
THIS MORNING.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.919
- ON A BUS?

25:19.952 --> 25:21.754
JESUS, LOOK AT THOSE LAPELS.

25:21.788 --> 25:23.990
- THEY DIDN'T COME
FOR NO FASHION SHOW.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.593
I EXPECT YOU TO TREAT THEM
WITH THE SAME RESPECT

25:26.626 --> 25:28.160
AND COURTESY
YOU WOULD ANY HUMAN BEING

25:28.194 --> 25:30.096
WITH A $30 MILLION ACCOUNT.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.231
- JESUS, YOU HAD ME WORRIED
THERE FOR A SECOND, GARDNER.

25:32.264 --> 25:35.101
- GET YOUR ASS IN HERE
AND SIGN 'EM UP.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.769
AH, MR. FRAWLEY,
LOVELY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.838
YEAH, YOU'RE LOOKING GOOD.
[indistinct chatter]

25:38.871 --> 25:40.039
[cell phone ringing]

25:40.072 --> 25:41.941
OH, PLEASE, PLEASE.
- HE'S A GOOD MAN.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.009
- THE FIGURES WE'RE GOING
TO BE DISCUSSING TODAY...

25:43.042 --> 25:45.144
- WHAT'S UP?

25:45.177 --> 25:48.014
- YEAH, DO YOU THINK WE COULD
GET THIS MEETING GOING?

25:48.047 --> 25:50.016
- EXCUSE ME ONE SECOND.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.318
I'LL BE--I'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.154
- SIT THERE.
DON'T MOVE.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.894
I HAVE TO GO.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.664
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE HAVE A MEETING.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.998
- RESCHEDULE IT.

26:06.032 --> 26:07.700
I HAVE THE ENTIRE BOARD

26:07.734 --> 26:09.702
OF FRAWLEY'S OPEN FIRE
IN THERE.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.940
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THEM?

26:13.973 --> 26:15.274
- ORDER THEM A STEAK.

26:15.307 --> 26:18.911
- BOBBY, LUNCH IS ON YOU
THIS TIME.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.847
- I PAID THE LAST TIME.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.849
- MY GRANDFATHER TAUGHT ME
HOW TO PLAY.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.851
HE WAS A VIOLINIST
FOR THE BERLIN PHILHARMONIC

26:24.884 --> 26:27.286
BEFORE THEY THREW HIM
INTO A CONCENTRATION CAMP.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.889
- HOLY SHIT.
- YEAH.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.991
HE STILL PRACTICED
SIX HOURS A DAY,

26:32.024 --> 26:34.126
EVEN THOUGH HE DIDN'T
HAVE A VIOLIN.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.595
- SO HOW DID HE?

26:41.267 --> 26:42.969
- BY THE TIME HE GOT OUT
OF AUSCHWITZ,

26:43.002 --> 26:45.371
HE SAID HIS TECHNIQUE
HAD ACTUALLY IMPROVED,

26:45.404 --> 26:46.706
THAT HIS, UH, PERFORMANCE

26:46.739 --> 26:48.007
OF THE MENDELSSOHN
VIOLIN CONCERTO

26:48.040 --> 26:50.109
WAS THE GREATEST
NEVER HEARD.

26:50.142 --> 26:54.246
- THAT'S AMAZING.
- YEAH.

26:54.280 --> 26:59.085
THE ONLY THING THAT KEPT HIM
GOING WAS HIS MUSIC.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.755
SOMETIMES I FEEL THE SAME WAY.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.857
- I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.059
NO MATTER HOW SHITTY THINGS GET,
I ALWAYS HAVE ART.

27:07.093 --> 27:12.098
IT'S THE ONE PLACE I CAN GO
WHERE I'LL ALWAYS BE SAFE.

27:12.131 --> 27:15.768
I NEVER TOLD ANYONE THAT
BEFORE.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.837
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

27:17.870 --> 27:21.741
NOT EVEN YOUR RICH,
SUCCESSFUL BOYFRIEND?

27:21.774 --> 27:24.310
- NOT EVEN HIM.
NO.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.978
[sighs]

27:26.012 --> 27:30.049
- SO...

27:30.082 --> 27:31.417
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

27:31.450 --> 27:32.952
- NO CHANGING THE SUBJECT.

27:32.985 --> 27:38.691
- COME ON, I'M CURIOUS.
- [chuckles]

27:38.725 --> 27:40.426
THERE WAS THIS GUY.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.894
- YEAH?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.195
- YEAH.

27:43.229 --> 27:48.434
AND I WAS SO FUCKING CRAZY
ABOUT HIM,

27:48.467 --> 27:52.104
I CAN--
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

27:52.138 --> 27:56.108
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.178
- WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

27:59.211 --> 28:01.213
BUT HE LIKED TO GO
TO THE CLUBS

28:01.247 --> 28:04.483
AND PARTY
AND BRING GUYS HOME, AND--

28:04.516 --> 28:07.353
FOR A WHILE, I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT WAS PRETTY EXCITING.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.421
- I SUPPOSE IT CAN BE.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.824
- BUT THEN I REALIZED
IT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

28:15.895 --> 28:18.865
- MM.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.100
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

28:25.037 --> 28:28.808
- I WANT TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
WHO ONLY WANTS TO BE WITH ME,

28:28.841 --> 28:33.479
WHO DOESN'T NEED
TO SEE OTHER PEOPLE

28:33.512 --> 28:37.884
OR BE IN THE SCENE
EVERY NIGHT.

28:37.917 --> 28:39.118
I WANT TO BE
WITH SOMEBODY

28:39.151 --> 28:41.053
WHO I CAN HAVE A PICNIC
ON THE FLOOR WITH,

28:41.087 --> 28:45.057
AND TELL THINGS TO
THAT I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.998
[indistinct PA announcement]

28:56.535 --> 28:57.937
- I'M SORRY
TO CALL YOU.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.105
I-I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BOTHER YOU.

28:59.138 --> 29:03.843
- SHUT UP.
HOW IS HE?

29:03.876 --> 29:06.178
- THEY'VE GOT HIM ON ALL THOSE
PAINKILLERS AND SHIT.

29:06.212 --> 29:07.346
THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IF--

29:07.379 --> 29:08.347
[sobbing]

29:08.380 --> 29:09.348
- HEY.

29:09.381 --> 29:14.486
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

29:14.520 --> 29:20.492
- [sobbing]

29:20.526 --> 29:23.996
I DON'T WANT HIM TO DIE.

29:24.030 --> 29:25.064
- HE'S NOT GOING TO--
HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.934
HE'S NOT GOING TO DIE.

29:27.967 --> 29:29.902
- [sobbing]

29:34.841 --> 29:37.076
I NEED TO BE STRONG.
[sniffles]

29:37.109 --> 29:38.577
- YOU ARE.
YOU--YOU ARE STRONG.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.980
- NO, I'M NOT.

29:41.013 --> 29:41.981
MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

29:42.014 --> 29:45.818
- YOUR MOM DOESN'T KNOW SHIT.

29:45.852 --> 29:46.953
LISTEN TO ME.
LISTEN TO ME.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.521
LISTEN TO ME.

29:49.555 --> 29:54.426
ARE YOU LISTENING?

29:54.460 --> 29:58.530
- I'M LISTENING.

29:58.564 --> 30:00.399
- THE NIGHT JUSTIN WAS BASHED,
AND I CALLED YOU,

30:00.432 --> 30:02.134
AND YOU WERE ABOUT
TO GET ON A PLANE,

30:02.168 --> 30:04.336
AND YOU CAME HERE AND YOU
SAT WITH ME FOR THREE DAYS,

30:04.370 --> 30:06.405
WAITING TO SEE IF HE WAS
GOING TO LIVE OR DIE.

30:06.438 --> 30:07.539
IF IT HADN'T
BEEN FOR YOU, I--

30:07.573 --> 30:10.142
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
MADE IT.

30:10.176 --> 30:14.180
IT WAS BECAUSE OF YOU.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.883
YOU'RE STRONG ENOUGH
FOR BOTH OF US,

30:16.916 --> 30:18.851
AND YOU'RE GOING
TO BE STRONG FOR BEN.

30:41.007 --> 30:45.211
- A MILLION DOLLARS?
- A MILLION DOLLARS.

30:45.244 --> 30:46.312
- A MILLION DOLLARS.

30:46.345 --> 30:47.513
THE FAMILY WANTS
TO SETTLE.

30:47.546 --> 30:50.382
- OH, YOU GOT 'EM.
OH, CONGRATS, MEL.

30:50.416 --> 30:51.884
[all laughing]

30:51.918 --> 30:53.085
YOU TOO, EM.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.054
- THANKS, BABY.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.123
[cheers]

30:57.156 --> 31:00.226
OH, WE SURE SHOWED THEM,
DIDN'T WE, MEL?

31:00.259 --> 31:02.594
- OH, WE SURE DID.

31:02.628 --> 31:04.363
HOWEVER, THERE ARE A FEW
STIPULATIONS.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.065
- STIPULATIONS?

31:06.098 --> 31:08.100
- OH, THAT WE NOT RELEASE
GEORGE'S TAPE TO THE PRESS.

31:08.134 --> 31:09.101
- THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.470
- AND THAT YOU SIGN THIS.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.239
- WHAT IS IT?

31:13.272 --> 31:14.673
- JUST A STATEMENT
THAT YOU AND GEORGE

31:14.706 --> 31:16.175
NEVER HAD A RELATIONSHIP,

31:16.208 --> 31:18.277
AND THAT ANY AFORESAID CLAIMS
TO THE CONTRARY

31:18.310 --> 31:22.081
ARE FALSE AND UNTRUE.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.549
- FORGET IT.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.017
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD ON A MINUTE, THERE.

31:25.051 --> 31:26.618
I MEAN,
LET'S NOT BE HASTY.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.520
I MEAN, TRUE, IT'S NOT
THE FULL $10 MILLION,

31:28.554 --> 31:30.256
BUT STILL, I MEAN,
YOU DON'T TOSS OUT A TRICK

31:30.289 --> 31:34.593
BECAUSE HE'S GOT A GOOD BODY
BUT BAD ACNE, RIGHT?

31:37.329 --> 31:39.231
LAST SATURDAY NIGHT--
NEVER MIND.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.600
- LOOK, GEORGE WANTED YOU
TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.269
AFTER ALL, THAT'S WHY
HE LEFT YOU THE MONEY.

31:43.302 --> 31:45.537
- BUT TO DENY WHAT WE HAD?

31:45.571 --> 31:46.638
- AS YOUR LAWYER,

31:46.672 --> 31:48.407
I CAN'T ADVISE YOU
TO SIGN SOMETHING

31:48.440 --> 31:50.142
YOU KNOW YOURSELF ISN'T TRUE.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.145
BUT AS YOUR FRIEND,
YOU KNOW THE TRUTH.

31:53.179 --> 31:54.680
WHAT YOU AND GEORGE
MEANT TO EACH OTHER,

31:54.713 --> 31:56.482
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.417
- THINK WHAT YOU CAN DO
WITH THE MONEY.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.553
YOU KNOW, REAL ESTATE,
MUNI BONDS.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.255
WITH THE PROPER INVESTMENTS,

32:03.289 --> 32:05.524
YOU COULD BE SET.
SET FOR LIFE.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.609
- WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?

32:23.642 --> 32:26.612
- IT'S A PICNIC.

32:28.780 --> 32:29.748
- A PICNIC.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.317
- I WENT TO THE GOURMET SHOP,

32:31.350 --> 32:33.119
AND I GOT A LOT
OF COOL, EXPENSIVE STUFF.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.087
BRIE, PATE, FRENCH BREAD--

32:35.121 --> 32:37.723
- MMM.
- MMM.

32:37.756 --> 32:42.728
- NOW, YOU KNOW I DON'T
EAT FAT OR CARBS AFTER 7:00.

32:42.761 --> 32:46.732
- I KNOW, BUT I THOUGHT
MAYBE JUST THIS ONCE.

32:46.765 --> 32:48.367
- WE COULD DINE ON THE FLOOR?

32:48.400 --> 32:53.072
- [laughs]
YEAH.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.640
- THIS IS PITTSBURGH,
NOT JAPAN.

32:54.673 --> 32:57.009
- OH, COME ON.

32:57.043 --> 33:00.612
IT'LL BE ROMANTIC.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.613
- [clears throat]

33:01.647 --> 33:03.749
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO GO OUT.

33:03.782 --> 33:06.218
I'VE HAD A FOR-SHIT DAY,
AND I NEED TO UNWIND.

33:06.252 --> 33:08.387
- YOU CAN DO THAT HERE.
- WE CANNOT DO THAT HERE.

33:08.420 --> 33:09.788
NOW, COME ON.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.557
- HOW ABOUT CHEESE AND CRACKERS?
I'LL MAKE IT FOR YOU.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.624
- CHEESE AND CRACKERS AREN'T
GOING TO CUT IT.

33:12.658 --> 33:17.496
NOW COME ON, GET UP,
GET DRESSED.

33:17.529 --> 33:20.366
- CAN WE PLEASE STAY HOME,
FOR ONE NIGHT,

33:20.399 --> 33:22.168
JUST THE TWO OF US?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.707
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG
TO SETTLE DOWN.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.077
- YOU'RE TOO OLD
TO FUCK AROUND.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.178
- [laughs]

33:39.151 --> 33:40.652
NOW I'M GOING TO BABYLON.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.188
YOU CAN EITHER COME WITH ME,

33:42.221 --> 33:44.190
OR YOU CAN STAY HERE.

33:44.223 --> 33:45.291
IT'S YOUR CALL.

35:13.412 --> 35:14.380
EAT THE MEAT.

PLEASE HANG ON ONE MOMENT.

35:35.901 --> 35:38.370
- DEBBIE?

35:38.404 --> 35:41.507
- BEN, I DIDN'T WANT
TO DISTURB YOU.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.509
- OH, NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.
I WAS JUST--

35:43.542 --> 35:44.876
I WAS JUST RESTING.

35:44.910 --> 35:49.381
- I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
COME SOONER.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.916
MICHAEL DIDN'T TELL ME.

35:50.949 --> 35:54.820
- YEAH, HE DIDN'T WANT
TO UPSET YOU.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.256
- I HAVE THE FEELING

35:57.289 --> 36:01.393
IT'S NOT ME
HE WAS WORRYING ABOUT.

36:01.427 --> 36:03.529
OH.

36:03.562 --> 36:05.364
I BROUGHT YOU SOME, UH,

36:05.397 --> 36:06.832
HOMEMADE CHICKEN BROTH.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.268
CURES ALL ILLS.

36:09.301 --> 36:14.306
- THANK YOU.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.675
- SO, HOW--
HOW ARE YOU?

36:16.708 --> 36:19.778
- OH, I'M, UH, BETTER.

36:22.848 --> 36:26.418
I'M BETTER.

36:26.452 --> 36:29.588
- I'M SURE YOU'RE GOING
TO BE JUST FINE.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.726
WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO WEAR YOU OUT.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.830
WE ALL KNOW HOW EXHAUSTING
I CAN BE.

36:38.864 --> 36:41.233
IF YOU SEE MICHAEL,

36:41.267 --> 36:44.770
TELL HIM I SAID HELLO.

36:44.803 --> 36:48.574
- DEBBIE.

36:48.607 --> 36:50.509
I'M REALLY SORRY

36:50.542 --> 36:54.012
FOR PUTTING HIM THROUGH THIS.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.315
MAYBE HE SHOULD'VE
LISTENED TO YOU.

36:56.348 --> 36:58.517
- TO ME?

36:58.550 --> 37:01.253
WHAT THE FUCK DO I KNOW?

37:01.287 --> 37:04.356
I'M...JUST
A CONTROLLING BITCH

37:04.390 --> 37:06.325
WHO SHOULD'VE KEPT
HER BIG MOUTH SHUT, HMM?

37:06.358 --> 37:07.726
- YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.

37:07.759 --> 37:12.464
YOU LOVE HIM.
YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT HIM.

37:12.498 --> 37:14.466
- WELL, I SUPPOSE THERE ARE
TWO WAYS OF THINKING ABOUT IT.

37:14.500 --> 37:20.472
I PREFER YOURS.

37:20.506 --> 37:23.008
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY
FOR A WHILE?

37:23.041 --> 37:27.879
I COULD USE SOME COMPANY.

37:27.913 --> 37:29.848
- SURE, I'LL JUST
HEAT THIS UP.

37:29.881 --> 37:30.849
- OH, I, UH--

37:30.882 --> 37:32.318
NOT REALLY HUNGRY.

37:32.351 --> 37:33.952
- DON'T ARGUE WITH ME.
YOU'RE GONNA EAT IT.

37:38.023 --> 37:41.527
- [chuckles]

37:41.560 --> 37:43.695
- AH, EVERYTHING SEEMS
TO BE IN ORDER.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.898
JUST THE FORMALITY
OF MR. HONEYCUTT'S SIGNATURE.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.909
MRS. SCHICKEL WOULD LIKE
TO EXPRESS HER GRATITUDE

37:57.943 --> 38:01.046
FOR RESOLVING THIS IN A QUIET
AND DIGNIFIED MANNER,

38:01.079 --> 38:04.683
AS BEFITS HER LATE HUSBAND'S
MEMORY.

38:04.716 --> 38:08.520
- WELL, BE SURE AND THANK
MRS. SCHICKEL FOR THANKING ME.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.692
UM, BEFORE I SIGN,
MAY I SEE THE CHECK?

38:13.725 --> 38:15.694
- CERTAINLY.

38:21.767 --> 38:22.768
- I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHAT A CHECK

38:22.801 --> 38:25.504
FOR $1 MILLION
WOULD LOOK LIKE.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.939
AND NOW I KNOW.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.442
A LOT OF ZEROES.

38:34.846 --> 38:35.847
[all gasp]

38:35.881 --> 38:36.848
- E-EMMETT--

38:36.882 --> 38:38.083
- WHAT IS THIS?

38:38.116 --> 38:40.952
ANOTHER DEVIOUS PLOY?

38:40.986 --> 38:43.989
- BY AN "AMBITIOUS
PORN SITE HUSTLER"?

38:44.022 --> 38:46.492
NO, MR. WYLIE.
IT'S NOT A PLOY.

38:46.525 --> 38:50.796
YOU SEE, I, UH, I MAY NOT
HAVE $1 MILLION, LIKE GEORGE,

38:50.829 --> 38:52.931
BUT I DO HAVE THE TRUTH.

38:52.964 --> 38:55.867
IT'S MY ONLY CURRENCY.

38:55.901 --> 38:58.837
AND IT'S MY GIFT TO HIM.

38:58.870 --> 39:04.009
- EMMETT, YOU DO REALIZE
WHAT YOU ARE DOING?

39:04.042 --> 39:08.980
- I TOLD YOU, I NEVER WANTED
A PENNY FROM HIM.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.849
YOU CAN TAKE EVERYTHING.

39:10.882 --> 39:13.752
EVERY CENT.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.454
BUT THE ONE THING
I WON'T LET YOU TAKE

39:15.487 --> 39:18.424
IS WHAT GEORGE AND I SHARED.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.991
THAT'S MINE,

39:20.025 --> 39:24.095
AND YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

39:24.129 --> 39:28.667
- WELL, I GUESS THAT CONCLUDES
OUR BUSINESS HERE, GENTLEMEN.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.768
- OH, HEH.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.503
ONE MORE THING.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.679
[indistinct chatter]

39:40.712 --> 39:43.515
- [on PA] DR. ROBERTS,
PLEASE REPORT TO EMERGENCY.

39:43.549 --> 39:44.916
DR. ROBERTS.

39:59.631 --> 40:00.866
- YOU WANT TO LOSE
THE FAMILY CROWD,

40:00.899 --> 40:03.902
THE STROLLERS AND THE WALKERS,
AND GO FOR THE YOUNG SINGLES?

40:03.935 --> 40:06.605
WELL THEN, I HAVE THREE WORDS
FOR YOU.

40:13.579 --> 40:14.780
- "EAT THE MEAT"?

40:14.813 --> 40:16.482
- HOW'S THAT GONNA PLAY
IN THE MIDWEST?

40:16.515 --> 40:17.716
[overlapping chatter]

40:17.749 --> 40:20.185
- THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE KEPT US
WAITING FOR?

40:20.218 --> 40:22.788
THERE ISN'T EVEN A PICTURE
OF A STEAK ON THERE.

40:22.821 --> 40:24.723
- WELL, UNLESS YOU'VE
REDESIGNED IT,

40:24.756 --> 40:26.124
PEOPLE KNOW WHAT A T-BONE
LOOKS LIKE.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.727
- AND WHERE'S THE NAME
OF OUR RESTAURANT?

40:28.760 --> 40:32.063
- WE ADD THAT IN
THE SECOND WAVE OF THE CAMPAIGN.

40:36.835 --> 40:39.538
- THERE'S ALSO, UH,

40:39.571 --> 40:42.107
SOMETHING VAGUELY, UH...

40:42.140 --> 40:43.942
SEXUAL ABOUT THAT.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.577
[chuckling]

40:45.611 --> 40:48.914

YOUR YOUNG SINGLES AGREE.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.082
[indistinct chatter]

40:51.116 --> 40:52.484
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS
THINK ABOUT THIS?

40:52.518 --> 40:54.653
- I THINK IT'S NICE.
- WHAT?

40:54.686 --> 40:55.887
YOU LIKE IT?

40:55.921 --> 40:58.590
[overlapping chatter]

40:58.624 --> 41:01.927

41:01.960 --> 41:03.829

41:03.862 --> 41:05.964
HOW DID YOU THINK OF THAT?

41:05.997 --> 41:07.866
- IT JUST CAME TO ME.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.204
- INSULIN'S STABLE.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.640
ENZYME LEVEL'S BACK DOWN.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.941

- [laughs]

41:18.977 --> 41:21.146
SO, WHEN CAN I GO HOME?

41:21.179 --> 41:22.548
- MAYBE TOMORROW.

41:22.581 --> 41:24.182
YOU NEED TO STAY IN BED
FOR A FEW DAYS.

41:24.215 --> 41:26.117
- WELL, I'LL CHAIN HIM
TO THE HEADBOARD.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.586
HE'LL LIKE THAT.

41:27.619 --> 41:29.154
- AND I WANT YOU TO GO
ON A HOLIDAY.

41:29.187 --> 41:30.656
- HOW ABOUT TIBET?

41:30.689 --> 41:35.060
- A DRUG HOLIDAY.

41:35.093 --> 41:36.094
- ARE YOU SURE?

41:36.127 --> 41:39.264
- YOUR BODY COULD USE A REST
FOR A FEW MONTHS.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.601
WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

41:42.634 --> 41:45.837

41:45.871 --> 41:47.873
- WELL, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.
YOU GET TO GO.

41:47.906 --> 41:48.974
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE ON THE MEDS.

41:49.007 --> 41:51.009

WHAT HAPPENS.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.878
- HEY.

42:51.169 --> 42:52.738
WHENEVER I PLAY
TOO LATE.

42:52.771 --> 42:55.707

- YEAH.

42:55.741 --> 42:59.878

TELL THEM THAT.

43:01.112 --> 43:05.083
SOMEDAY THEY'LL BE PAYING
100 BUCKS A TICKET TO HEAR ME.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.785

43:12.023 --> 43:13.925
I CAME FOR MY SONG.

43:17.395 --> 43:20.699
- RIGHT.

43:20.732 --> 43:23.669
RIGHT.

43:23.702 --> 43:26.772
SO WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE TO HEAR?

ASTONISHING?
