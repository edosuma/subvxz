01:39.493 --> 01:42.079
August 9, 2:30 p.m.
Greenwich Mean Time.

01:42.149 --> 01:44.320
The H.M.S. Churchill,
outward bound.

01:44.389 --> 01:47.073
On board: a joint
British-American space team.

01:47.141 --> 01:51.331
Their mission: to intercept and study
the comet bearing Dr. Halley's name.

01:51.397 --> 01:55.172
The Churchill is the first spacecraft
equipped with the Nerva engine.

01:55.237 --> 01:57.921
It propels the Churchill
with constant acceleration...

01:57.990 --> 02:01.503
enough to create Earth-type gravity for
the first time on an extended flight.

02:01.574 --> 02:05.698
The Churchill is on course
for its rendezvous.

02:05.766 --> 02:08.417
- Sir, this is odd.
- What?

02:08.485 --> 02:09.979
I'm getting a small radar
cross section...

02:10.054 --> 02:13.087
just ahead of the nucleus
in the coma of the comet.

02:13.157 --> 02:17.216
I've got it too. Check the length.
It's at the limit of my scan angle.

02:17.286 --> 02:19.293
- What's going on?
- You run an equipment check?

02:19.365 --> 02:20.926
Every five minutes.

02:20.998 --> 02:23.780
- Radar states 150 miles.
- 150 miles what?

02:23.846 --> 02:26.661
- Length.
- 150 miles long?

02:28.006 --> 02:29.566
What's 150 miles Long?

02:29.638 --> 02:31.231
It's a radar trace.

02:31.302 --> 02:34.685
- Something in the coma of the comet.
- Show me.

02:34.758 --> 02:38.020
- E.G.R. is confirmed.
- Looks good.

02:38.086 --> 02:39.461
E.G.R. is optimal.

02:39.526 --> 02:41.020
Track three on three.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.468
Roger.

02:43.495 --> 02:45.349
What's its height?

02:45.415 --> 02:48.579
I've got a vertical reading
of two miles at least.

02:48.647 --> 02:50.916
Ambient temperature: six degrees.

02:50.983 --> 02:53.252
Less than two percent traces
of manganese, titanium--

02:53.318 --> 02:54.693
Try and raise base.

02:54.759 --> 02:57.476
Tell them we have an artificial
object out here hidden--

02:57.543 --> 03:01.155
- Are you sure you want to say ''hidden''?
- It's located in the head of the comet.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.874
Keep sending that
until they acknowledge.

03:03.943 --> 03:05.634
Use a secured downlink.

03:05.703 --> 03:08.605
Sorry, Commander, everything's
been swamped by the coma winds.

03:08.679 --> 03:10.653
We can't get anything back to base.

03:10.727 --> 03:12.669
How Long is the blackout period?

03:12.743 --> 03:14.685
All the way.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.196
What are you gonna do?

03:28.264 --> 03:29.638
Go on in.

03:31.944 --> 03:34.083
We're only gonna get one chance,
Derebridge.

03:35.464 --> 03:38.911
That thing won't be back
for another 76 years...

03:38.984 --> 03:41.472
and we'll both be dead.

03:41.544 --> 03:43.551
We have to take a look now.

03:52.937 --> 03:56.068
- Shut down Nerva.
- Shutting down.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.892
Down.

04:08.361 --> 04:12.135
- Solar panels retracted.
- Check. Give me a readout, Bob.

04:46.090 --> 04:48.294
Executing E.V.A. maneuver.

05:00.939 --> 05:03.426
Where do you suppose
this thing came from?

05:04.810 --> 05:08.487
- Was it exploring the comet?
- Come on, guys, let's do it.

05:09.739 --> 05:11.746
The surface looks badly pitted.

05:11.818 --> 05:14.786
In that case,
it's been here a Long time.

05:14.859 --> 05:16.866
It's derelict, whatever it is.

05:16.939 --> 05:19.906
Stand by, Churchill.
We're going in.

05:19.979 --> 05:23.110
Roger, Carlsen.
We copy. We have you going in.

05:26.060 --> 05:30.948
Churchill, it looks like
some giant artery, organic.

05:31.019 --> 05:33.670
I almost have the feeling
I've been here before.

05:37.580 --> 05:39.271
Oh, boy.

05:45.675 --> 05:48.010
This is incredible.

05:48.076 --> 05:51.207
I hope you can appreciate
the scale of this on the video.

05:51.276 --> 05:53.764
Roger. We're getting it.
It's ail on tape.

05:57.612 --> 05:58.986
Oh, shit.

05:59.052 --> 06:01.922
Whoa. Here they are.

06:10.252 --> 06:11.659
Churchill...

06:11.725 --> 06:14.659
it looks like we found the occupants
of the ship.

06:16.044 --> 06:19.754
They Look like giant bats.

06:28.653 --> 06:34.021
- There must be hundreds of them.
- Thousands.

06:34.093 --> 06:36.264
Dead, I hope.

06:51.790 --> 06:53.699
Looks prehistoric.

07:01.326 --> 07:03.181
It's completely desiccated.

07:07.214 --> 07:12.037
- Crumbles.
- Yes, it would.

07:12.110 --> 07:15.209
ALL the fluid’s been lost
to space over the years.

07:23.183 --> 07:26.052
We’ll bag this one,
take it with us.

07:26.126 --> 07:29.771
We're deploying
the specimen bag.

07:46.671 --> 07:48.046
Jesus.

07:48.111 --> 07:50.729
What the hell is that?

07:51.311 --> 07:52.686
Commander...

07:52.751 --> 07:55.020
the ship has just deployed a--

07:55.087 --> 07:58.949
It looks Like some sort
of big structure that's just unfolding.

07:59.023 --> 08:00.485
It's enormous.

08:01.776 --> 08:04.743
God, what is it?

08:11.568 --> 08:12.877
We must get out of here.

08:12.944 --> 08:14.766
Nobody's going anywhere.
Stay where you are.

08:16.112 --> 08:19.243
Churchill, this is Carlsen.
What's happening out there?

08:19.312 --> 08:20.938
The thing stopped opening.

08:21.008 --> 08:25.067
The only way to describe it is
it's Like a giant umbrella.

08:25.136 --> 08:28.911
Good God.
It's absolutely enormous.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.699
What's it doing now?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.134
Nothing, sir.

08:36.912 --> 08:38.505
It's stopped opening.

08:38.576 --> 08:40.715
It's just sitting there.

08:40.784 --> 08:44.495
- Can you tell what it's made of?
- Not metal.

08:44.561 --> 08:46.284
It's radar transparent.

08:48.337 --> 08:50.028
Okay.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.235
If it starts up again,
let me know.

08:52.305 --> 08:54.607
Any activity out there.
You understand?

08:54.673 --> 08:56.048
Yes, sir.

09:03.922 --> 09:05.776
That's where we're going.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.713
There's something there.

10:04.787 --> 10:06.991
Commander, this is Churchill.

10:07.059 --> 10:09.906
We're losing our signal.
We've lost V.T.R.

10:09.972 --> 10:11.630
Come in, Commander!

10:29.300 --> 10:32.115
Three bodies.

10:32.180 --> 10:34.155
Perfectly preserved.

10:36.405 --> 10:39.372
They Look to me
to be Like an--

10:39.444 --> 10:42.313
Something's happening to me.

10:42.388 --> 10:44.723
What's wrong with me?

10:59.829 --> 11:01.203
Commander, come in.

11:01.268 --> 11:04.083
This is Churchill.
Do you copy?

11:07.989 --> 11:11.436
They seem to be in some sort
of suspended animation or sleep.

11:11.509 --> 11:12.916
Hold on.
We're coming down.

11:35.125 --> 11:38.028
Churchill, if you read...

11:38.101 --> 11:41.135
there are two nude males
and one female.

11:41.206 --> 11:45.581
This is Churchill.
We have no picture. Come in, Tom.

11:45.654 --> 11:50.356
Churchill,
I said we found a young girl.

11:50.423 --> 11:53.172
''Girl''? You mean human?

11:53.238 --> 11:55.540
Definitely humanoid.

11:55.606 --> 11:57.461
I'd say she's perfect.

11:57.526 --> 12:00.822
I've been in space for six months.
She looks perfect to me.

12:06.391 --> 12:10.286
- Derebridge, what's wrong?
- What's wrong?

12:22.167 --> 12:26.607
- How many do you want to take back?
- I say we take back ail three...

12:26.679 --> 12:29.713
and one of the dead things
in the other chamber.

12:29.784 --> 12:33.428
Let's see if we can break them free.

12:53.208 --> 12:55.477
Churchill, come in.
This is Mission Control, Great Britain.

12:55.544 --> 12:57.399
Do you copy?

12:57.464 --> 13:00.050
If they're going to pick us up,
they should get us this close.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.259
Simply aren't receiving,
Dr. Bukovsky.

13:02.329 --> 13:05.231
Automatic circuits don't even respond.

13:06.328 --> 13:08.368
They're radio dead.

13:08.441 --> 13:12.118
Christ, I hope it's just
their communications.

13:23.289 --> 13:24.980
How's their orbit Look?

13:25.049 --> 13:28.344
You can see it's stable,
but they're slightly off.

13:28.409 --> 13:29.783
They should have adjusted
coming in...

13:29.849 --> 13:31.343
but they haven't.

13:31.417 --> 13:32.792
What do you make of that?

13:32.857 --> 13:35.126
It would appear that
they set their course...

13:35.193 --> 13:38.489
just after they left the comet
and haven't updated it since.

13:44.666 --> 13:47.797
- The Columbia?
- The Columbia.

13:47.865 --> 13:50.931
We have a liftoff.

13:56.058 --> 13:57.487
Tower cleared.

14:07.578 --> 14:09.782
Control, this is Columbia.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.792
Are we cleared
to initiate docking procedure?

14:11.866 --> 14:14.288
Go ahead, Columbia.
You are looking good.

14:14.362 --> 14:16.729
Stand by for soft dock.

14:17.851 --> 14:19.225
Soft dock.

14:22.203 --> 14:23.577
Soft dock confirmed.

15:32.893 --> 15:35.992
Columbia,
the ship's completely gutted.

15:36.061 --> 15:37.490
Oh, my God.

15:37.565 --> 15:41.623
Houston, we have a problem.
There's been a fire.

15:46.493 --> 15:50.007
I'll take a Look in the tug bay.
You two, try the top deck.

16:15.422 --> 16:17.462
Columbia, they're ail dead.

16:18.878 --> 16:21.780
Nothing down here, Columbia.
I'm going into the tug bay.

16:24.990 --> 16:26.365
I'll get the tapes.

16:56.063 --> 16:57.438
Somner...

16:57.503 --> 16:59.892
there's something you ought to see
in the tug bay.

17:15.039 --> 17:19.349
I see.
How did you open the girl’s case?

17:19.423 --> 17:21.082
We didn't, Minister.

17:21.152 --> 17:24.796
We were talking about how to get it open
when it popped open of its own accord.

17:24.864 --> 17:28.028
- Did you X-ray the crystal cases?
- We're not certain they're crystal.

17:28.096 --> 17:31.413
The casings are not metallic.
I'm not even sure they're organic.

17:31.488 --> 17:34.936
The casing is right there
in front of us without being there...

17:35.008 --> 17:37.343
- if that makes any sense.
- And the bodies?

17:38.528 --> 17:39.957
We're going to do
our first dissection now.

17:41.889 --> 17:44.572
Provided, of course,
that Dr. Fallada agrees they're dead.

17:49.217 --> 17:52.119
I don't know that I am qualified
to pass judgment on alien death.

17:52.193 --> 17:54.364
You would agree that
they're less alive than we are?

17:56.097 --> 18:00.287
Yesterday in Hong Kong,
gold closed lower.

18:00.353 --> 18:03.102
In light trading
on European currency markets...

18:03.169 --> 18:05.886
the pound closed mixed against
the dollar and West German marks.

18:08.065 --> 18:11.000
There will be a full market report
after the late news.

18:11.073 --> 18:14.270
This is James Graham
reporting from the city.

18:14.338 --> 18:16.193
Now back to the newsroom.

18:22.722 --> 18:24.991
Halley’s Comet is now
dominating the northern sky...

18:25.057 --> 18:27.424
stretching over 100 million miles
across the heavens...

18:27.489 --> 18:30.523
occupying one-sixth
of the entire visible horizon.

18:30.594 --> 18:32.798
On this exceptionally clear night...

18:32.866 --> 18:36.379
a group of enthusiasts are commemorating
Dr. Edmund Halley’s great prediction...

18:36.450 --> 18:40.225
by holding an outdoor watching from
his original observatory at Greenwich.

18:40.290 --> 18:42.145
Our viewers may be interested
to know...

18:42.210 --> 18:45.756
that comets were once considered
to be hargingers of evil.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.543
One of the earliest words
for comet was ''disaster''...

18:48.610 --> 18:50.847
which in Latin means ''evil star.''

18:50.915 --> 18:54.777
It may indeed be an evil star
for the deep space probe Churchill.

18:54.851 --> 18:58.331
There's still no word from Her Majesty's
government as to the fate of the crew...

18:58.402 --> 19:00.158
whether they're alive or dead.

19:00.226 --> 19:01.852
We can only await
further developments--

22:15.272 --> 22:16.679
Use my body.

22:51.178 --> 22:53.633
- Where's the girl?
- She's gone.

22:57.161 --> 22:58.536
I saw her.

23:02.921 --> 23:04.678
She did that.

23:08.202 --> 23:10.504
- Security.
- Hello. Professor Fallada here.

23:10.570 --> 23:12.577
I'm calling
at Dr. Bukovsky's orders.

23:12.650 --> 23:16.360
- Get me the duty security captain now.
- Yes, sir.

23:16.426 --> 23:17.800
Don't worry.

23:17.866 --> 23:21.095
A naked girl is not going
to get out of this complex.

23:57.195 --> 24:00.937
Four-nine to Control. You'll
never believe what I'm looking at.

24:03.755 --> 24:06.887
- Control, can you say that again?
- I believe you heard me.

24:06.956 --> 24:09.989
There's a girl on the loose
in the building. She must not leave.

24:10.059 --> 24:12.612
Pardon me, but I thought you said
she was naked.

24:12.683 --> 24:15.433
That's right. That's what I said.
Surely, you can find her.

24:15.500 --> 24:17.355
Must be some kind of joke.

24:22.988 --> 24:24.363
Don't believe it.

24:26.796 --> 24:28.868
ALL right, miss,
just stay where you are.

24:28.940 --> 24:30.828
You heard them.
They said grab her.

24:30.892 --> 24:33.827
Take it easy, mate.
She's not in her right mind.

24:33.901 --> 24:37.196
Control, we have Located the girl
in the main lobby.

24:38.541 --> 24:40.297
That's it. Come on.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.490
- Yes?
- We've Located the girl, sir.

24:43.564 --> 24:45.866
- Where?
- She's downstairs in the main lobby.

24:45.932 --> 24:47.656
Right.

24:47.725 --> 24:51.881
She's in the main Lobby.
You ail right to go down there?

24:53.037 --> 24:55.241
Nice and easy.

24:55.309 --> 24:58.789
Come on.
Come to me.

24:58.861 --> 25:00.749
Come to Daddy.

25:10.478 --> 25:12.867
Make it stop.

25:12.941 --> 25:15.397
Come on!
Let's get her!

26:00.271 --> 26:02.027
- Are you ail right, mate?
- Yeah.

26:24.175 --> 26:29.064
ALL nonmilitary personnel
please clear the area.

26:29.136 --> 26:33.292
I repeat: Everybody who has
no business to be here...

26:33.359 --> 26:37.134
please clear the area
for your own safety.

26:37.199 --> 26:38.890
This is a police announcement.

26:42.256 --> 26:45.420
Sorry, gentlemen,
no photographs, please.

26:46.896 --> 26:48.586
It's ail right.

26:48.656 --> 26:52.715
- Which of you is Dr. Bukovsky?
- I am.

26:52.784 --> 26:55.784
- I'm Colonel Caine.
- From the S.A.S.?

26:55.856 --> 26:59.686
That last remark is not for publication.
This is a D notice situation.

27:13.553 --> 27:14.927
Not too close.

27:18.513 --> 27:21.961
And this was murder, you say?

27:27.153 --> 27:29.641
Tell me again
how the girl overpowered you.

27:31.793 --> 27:33.168
She--

27:35.954 --> 27:39.402
It was the most overwhelmingly
feminine presence I've ever encountered.

27:40.754 --> 27:43.721
- I was drawn to her on a level that--
- Was it sexual?

27:43.793 --> 27:47.568
Yes, overwhelmingly so.

27:47.633 --> 27:51.430
And horrible.
Loss of control.

27:51.506 --> 27:53.416
The guard was dead
when you came into the room?

27:53.490 --> 27:56.719
- You found him as he is now?
- Yeah.

27:56.786 --> 27:59.885
And the girl came from the ship
Churchill?

27:59.955 --> 28:01.416
Uh-huh.

28:01.490 --> 28:04.839
She spoke to you, in English?

28:04.914 --> 28:06.376
That's right.

28:06.450 --> 28:09.101
How would she know English?

28:09.170 --> 28:12.945
Going back, you say the ship's tapes
were destroyed in the fire.

28:13.010 --> 28:14.865
They weren't destroyed
in the fire.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.418
That's what we were told
to tell the public. They were erased.

28:17.490 --> 28:18.865
''Erased''?

28:18.931 --> 28:21.102
Also, the Churchill's escape pod
is missing.

28:21.171 --> 28:23.692
- Did someone escape?
- We don't know.

28:23.763 --> 28:25.737
Unfortunately, the condition
of the bodies...

28:25.811 --> 28:28.299
make an accurate count
impossible.

28:28.371 --> 28:30.542
Could the heat from the fire
have launched the pod?

28:34.451 --> 28:36.306
What started the fire?

28:38.835 --> 28:43.505
The ship's oxygen system ignited.
It was a terribly hot fire.

28:43.571 --> 28:48.241
Yet you say the three cases
containing the bodies were untouched.

28:48.308 --> 28:50.381
- That's correct.
- Where were they found?

28:50.451 --> 28:52.623
In the bay
where the space tug was stored.

28:52.692 --> 28:54.699
Where everything else was charred.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.863
Incredible, is it not?

29:00.724 --> 29:06.126
- Have you examined the cases?
- Using every technique we have.

29:06.197 --> 29:08.335
X-ray scans of the cases
yield only blurred images.

29:08.404 --> 29:13.107
-What does that mean?
-They're not precisely physical objects.

29:13.172 --> 29:15.059
More Like a force field.

29:15.124 --> 29:19.019
We're a bit out of our depth here.
The whole thing is--

29:19.092 --> 29:21.907
Yes, I know, incredible.

29:23.253 --> 29:26.668
Have they done an autopsy yet
on the guard? I suppose not.

29:26.741 --> 29:28.115
What about your two other bodies?

29:29.973 --> 29:32.908
Colonel, may I be excused?

29:32.980 --> 29:35.501
I seem to be feeling
a little more nauseous than I thought.

29:35.573 --> 29:36.947
Yes, of course.

29:45.269 --> 29:48.116
I noticed from your door, Dr. Fallada,
that your area is biochemistry.

29:49.590 --> 29:51.444
But I understand
your real interest is--

29:51.510 --> 29:53.681
Death, Colonel Caine.
Correct.

29:53.749 --> 29:55.604
Thanatology is the name for it.

29:55.669 --> 29:58.003
Death for you
is a bureaucratic problem.

29:58.070 --> 30:00.557
Who did it? When?
Why did they do it?

30:00.629 --> 30:03.117
- Am I correct?
- And for you?

30:04.150 --> 30:06.005
I'm fascinated by death itself:

30:06.070 --> 30:09.169
what happens as we die, when we die,
what happens after we die.

30:09.238 --> 30:11.442
- You mean life after death?
- Yes.

30:11.510 --> 30:16.725
- Is there life after death?
- Do you really want to know?

30:20.950 --> 30:24.845
But to answer your question,
yes, I think there is.

30:24.919 --> 30:28.563
If I am correct, the lifeforce
is conserved always...

30:28.630 --> 30:30.518
and in ail things,
even after death.

30:30.582 --> 30:33.233
You think that applies
to what's happened here tonight?

30:33.303 --> 30:36.565
Yes, I do.

30:36.631 --> 30:39.926
I think that girl, creature...

30:39.991 --> 30:42.576
drained energy, lifeforce...

30:42.647 --> 30:47.055
partiality from Bukovsky
and totally from the guard.

30:47.127 --> 30:50.673
- A vampire?
- It could be described that way.

30:50.743 --> 30:52.652
In a sense, we're ail vampires.

30:52.727 --> 30:56.142
We drain energy
from other Life-forms.

30:56.215 --> 30:59.215
The difference is one of degree.

30:59.287 --> 31:02.037
That girl was no girl.

31:02.104 --> 31:05.901
She is totally alien to this planet
and our Life-form...

31:05.976 --> 31:07.983
and totally dangerous.

31:43.896 --> 31:45.271
Jesus.

31:46.905 --> 31:50.680
- Do you believe those blokes are alive?
- I'm not paid to believe nothing.

31:53.465 --> 31:55.320
I believe they're alive.

31:58.425 --> 32:00.498
Don't Look bloody dead to me.

32:52.314 --> 32:55.031
We've had some trouble,
but everything's under control.

32:55.098 --> 32:57.106
I think you better
come down here.

32:57.179 --> 32:59.088
Yes, sir.
Very good, sir.

33:14.363 --> 33:17.712
It would appear these two
are no longer dangerous.

33:17.787 --> 33:22.042
There is certainly no possibility
of doing a full autopsy on them.

33:22.108 --> 33:23.963
I would Like
to examine the guard.

33:24.028 --> 33:25.686
Have they started the autopsy
on the guard yet?

33:25.756 --> 33:27.130
I believe so, sir.

33:30.236 --> 33:34.513
This is an autopsy on the body of a
young man, dead approximately two hours.

33:34.588 --> 33:36.661
- Did you say he was about twenty?
- Yes, that's correct.

34:42.237 --> 34:43.612
Get the colonel down here!

35:37.024 --> 35:39.391
Put him in an isolation ceil,
quickly!

35:56.544 --> 35:58.933
I had no idea
it could be passed on.

35:59.008 --> 36:00.896
What do you suggest?

36:00.960 --> 36:03.262
I would recommend that you
place this body in another ceil.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.848
It was two hours ago
that the guard was attacked.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.855
I won't be at ail surprised
if we're seeing a pattern here.

36:08.928 --> 36:10.783
- Do as he says, Kelly.
- Yes, sir.

36:10.848 --> 36:12.703
Also, I want the two other male bodies
that were shot.

36:12.768 --> 36:14.623
Collect the pieces
and watch them.

36:14.688 --> 36:17.722
- Get me the Home Secretary now.
- Sir.

36:17.793 --> 36:20.346
- Call for the colonel, sir.
- Sir, you have a call.

36:25.536 --> 36:27.030
I'll be right there.

36:27.104 --> 36:30.104
They've just found a body in Hyde Park.
A naked girl.

36:30.177 --> 36:32.599
They say she's
in an indescribable condition.

36:32.673 --> 36:34.528
Could that be your girl?

36:35.489 --> 36:38.042
- Well?
- That's not her.

36:38.113 --> 36:39.968
Inspector,
what about the two boys?

36:40.034 --> 36:42.881
They were in the park earlier, sir.

36:42.945 --> 36:47.201
We saw her, I think, earlier.

36:47.265 --> 36:50.200
Any rate,
that looks like her hair.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.932
- What a mess.
- Was she alone?

36:52.002 --> 36:53.944
No, that's why we noticed her.

36:54.018 --> 36:56.920
She was with a dark-haired girl,
real good-looking and ail.

36:56.994 --> 36:58.782
Didn't have a lot
of clothes on either.

36:58.849 --> 37:00.704
We thought they might be--
Well, you know.

37:00.770 --> 37:03.487
Yes. Did you see where
the dark-haired girl went?

37:03.554 --> 37:06.107
No, we didn't.

37:06.178 --> 37:08.382
We angled on back
to see if maybe we could...

37:08.450 --> 37:11.483
you know,
see them doing something.

37:11.554 --> 37:13.594
- That's when we found her.
- How Long ago was that?

37:13.666 --> 37:16.536
- Half an hour ago.
- This lad phoned us, and we called you.

37:16.610 --> 37:18.650
Yes. Thank you, Inspector.

37:21.859 --> 37:24.062
Obviously, the work of the girl.

37:24.131 --> 37:26.848
Could we have this body sent back
to the center with the others?

37:26.915 --> 37:28.770
Yes, I suppose that's a good idea.

37:28.835 --> 37:31.256
Inspector, let me know
if you find anything else.

37:31.330 --> 37:33.818
- We’ll be taking her back with us.
- Very good, sir.

37:36.419 --> 37:37.793
Now she has clothes.

37:40.483 --> 37:42.752
There's something
I want you to see, sir.

37:52.003 --> 37:55.833
Dr. Hans Fallada, Sir Percy
Hestlestine, the Home Secretary.

37:55.907 --> 37:58.777
You're just in time.

37:58.852 --> 38:00.761
It's exactly two hours.

38:12.707 --> 38:15.904
This is the guard who was originally
overcome by the space girl.

38:50.021 --> 38:52.956
As I feared,
once transformed...

38:53.029 --> 38:55.549
the victims need regular infusions
of energy...

38:55.621 --> 38:58.010
- otherwise--
- Otherwise what?

39:20.806 --> 39:24.930
Oh, my God. Dear God.

39:26.374 --> 39:30.684
And we have the pathologist
who was attacked by the guard.

39:39.751 --> 39:42.533
- See?
- He, too, needs feeding.

39:58.375 --> 40:01.724
The same thing will happen
to that girl we found in the park...

40:01.799 --> 40:03.173
in about one hour.

41:21.257 --> 41:24.770
Good Lord! Goodness!

41:31.114 --> 41:32.488
She's the last?

41:32.553 --> 41:35.106
- Have there been any further reports?
- No, sir.

41:35.177 --> 41:37.566
We're set up to get the calls here
the instant one comes in.

41:37.642 --> 41:39.333
- What?
- Nothing.

41:39.402 --> 41:42.882
You say these creatures
were brought back from the Churchill?

41:42.953 --> 41:45.823
Yes, sir, but not this one.
She's a victim of the creatures.

41:45.898 --> 41:48.931
Yes, but where did
the Churchill acquire them?

41:49.002 --> 41:51.206
We have no way of determining that
at present.

41:51.274 --> 41:53.347
- Perhaps that's ail changing.
- What?

41:53.418 --> 41:56.069
I've just received a call
from the J.P.L. in Pasadena.

41:56.139 --> 41:58.310
The goldstone tracking disc
has just picked up something...

41:58.378 --> 42:02.786
they think is Churchill's escape pod
reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

42:02.859 --> 42:05.412
- Where?
- Texas.

42:37.964 --> 42:41.280
Where?
Waiter Reed Army Hospital?

42:41.356 --> 42:44.585
Is he hurt? Just exhausted.

42:44.651 --> 42:46.506
Get him the hell over here!

42:49.547 --> 42:51.435
Colonel Carlsen?
They're expecting you, sir.

42:53.836 --> 42:55.211
Colonel Carlsen, sir.

42:56.396 --> 42:57.770
Tom.

43:02.188 --> 43:04.043
I thought you were dead.

43:05.676 --> 43:09.418
Allow me to introduce Colonel Caine
of the Special Air Services.

43:09.484 --> 43:10.859
How do you do?

43:10.924 --> 43:13.291
- You already know Dr. Fallada.
- Colonel.

43:14.989 --> 43:16.363
Take a seat.

43:20.301 --> 43:22.635
I'm sorry to drag you over here
Like this.

43:22.700 --> 43:25.635
I'm sure you'd rather be recuperating
with a pretty nurse.

43:28.269 --> 43:30.690
We've got to know what happened
on the Churchill.

43:30.765 --> 43:32.259
Yes, of course.

43:35.501 --> 43:38.698
It may be very difficult
for you...

43:38.765 --> 43:41.253
to accept what
I'm going to say.

43:41.326 --> 43:44.293
We’ll have very Little difficulty
believing anything you have to tell us.

43:44.366 --> 43:47.530
- Do go on.
- You know something?

43:47.598 --> 43:50.500
There was a fire
aboard the Churchill.

43:50.574 --> 43:53.192
You might be interested to know that
the bodies of the three humanoids...

43:53.262 --> 43:55.150
were not destroyed in that fire.

43:55.214 --> 43:57.581
They survived in their cases.

43:57.646 --> 44:00.745
They were brought down here to London,
and the female has escaped.

44:00.814 --> 44:02.669
She's killed three people already.

44:04.077 --> 44:05.507
Oh, my God.

44:07.054 --> 44:09.542
So whatever you have to tell us
is rather pressing.

44:09.614 --> 44:12.462
Please, tell us what happened.

44:15.118 --> 44:17.606
We found the bodies
aboard the alien spacecraft.

44:17.678 --> 44:19.020
What alien spacecraft?

44:21.551 --> 44:24.071
Colonel,
take it from the beginning.

44:24.142 --> 44:28.168
Assume we know nothing,
which is understating the matter.

44:30.031 --> 44:33.162
We approached within 9,000 miles
of Halley’s Comet...

44:36.271 --> 44:39.053
when we detected an object
in the comet's coma.

44:39.119 --> 44:43.854
After we discovered the bodies,
we transferred them to the Churchill.

44:43.919 --> 44:47.781
We have the three humanoid creatures
and one of the bat-Like things.

44:47.855 --> 44:50.855
This is Churchill.
We copy. Welcome back.

44:50.927 --> 44:52.782
Have you gotten through
to Earth yet, Rawlings?

44:52.847 --> 44:56.011
No, sir, and the tail
of the comet's heating up.

45:00.687 --> 45:03.917
- What's the matter, Derebridge?
- I don't know, Tom.

45:03.984 --> 45:05.675
I feel drained.

45:05.744 --> 45:07.151
Do you?

45:08.911 --> 45:11.367
I feel invigorated.
You okay?

45:12.528 --> 45:15.976
- Yeah. I'm fine.
- Okay.

45:19.088 --> 45:21.543
Everybody back
to their stations.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.655
Let's get the hell out of here.

45:29.072 --> 45:32.171
On the trip back to Earth,
the crew began to die...

45:32.241 --> 45:34.096
one by one.

45:39.089 --> 45:40.550
Rawlings...

45:40.625 --> 45:42.535
the radio officer,
was the first to go.

45:53.969 --> 45:56.457
Rawlings denied any knowledge
of what he had done.

45:56.529 --> 45:58.504
I don't remember.

46:02.258 --> 46:05.607
Besides myself, you're the only one
who has been up here in the last hour.

46:06.994 --> 46:09.481
I've been feeling weak recently...

46:09.553 --> 46:11.888
not myself.

46:11.954 --> 46:14.823
Just don't remember.

46:30.290 --> 46:32.974
We found Rawlings' body
the next day.

46:41.619 --> 46:42.993
Exactly how...

46:43.058 --> 46:45.262
did he die, Colonel?

46:45.330 --> 46:48.178
The life just drained out of him.

46:53.235 --> 46:54.642
One by one...

46:57.619 --> 46:59.561
the rest of the crew
began to die.

47:03.123 --> 47:04.497
Somehow...

47:06.899 --> 47:08.754
I don't know how...

47:11.347 --> 47:12.940
I held out.

47:17.236 --> 47:19.243
It just seemed
to be a matter of will.

47:20.883 --> 47:22.738
I airways thought--

47:26.964 --> 47:28.338
The girl--

47:30.036 --> 47:32.753
Yes? The girl?

47:38.292 --> 47:40.594
I can't remember.

47:53.205 --> 47:55.376
What I remember next...

47:55.444 --> 47:58.510
is the view
out of the observation window...

47:58.580 --> 48:00.784
coming into Earth's orbit.

48:02.485 --> 48:05.649
I couldn’t expose the world
to what we'd brought back with us.

49:23.063 --> 49:25.299
I was determined
to destroy them ail.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.971
It was the hardest thing I ever did.

49:54.040 --> 49:56.178
We understand.

49:56.248 --> 49:58.103
It must have taken great courage
to try and make--

49:58.168 --> 50:00.023
No, you don't understand.

50:01.176 --> 50:04.242
Part of me didn't want to leave.

50:04.312 --> 50:07.214
She killed all my friends,
and I still didn't want to leave.

50:08.408 --> 50:10.514
Leaving her was the hardest thing
I ever did.

50:14.648 --> 50:17.299
Colonel Carlsen looks exhausted to me.

50:17.369 --> 50:20.566
We should allow him to get some sleep,
continue with this later.

50:20.633 --> 50:22.007
Very well.

50:24.153 --> 50:25.527
Thank you, Colonel.

50:51.450 --> 50:54.417
NASA tracking and ours...

50:54.490 --> 50:58.134
have just reported an unusual structure
leaving Halley’s Comet.

50:58.201 --> 50:59.576
It's headed for us.

50:59.642 --> 51:01.049
What is it?

51:02.138 --> 51:03.665
Radar ranging reports the object...

51:03.738 --> 51:07.513
is a needlelike shape,
150 miles Long.

51:07.578 --> 51:09.945
Its present course projects out
into a perfect Earth orbit...

51:10.010 --> 51:12.825
in a Little more than two days.

51:12.890 --> 51:15.705
I've just received a call
from the Prime Minister.

51:16.954 --> 51:19.059
There's going to be a meeting
at Downing Street.

51:19.130 --> 51:20.691
Prime Minister wants answers.

51:46.300 --> 51:48.154
Close your eyes.

51:56.444 --> 51:57.851
You're giving me your life.

52:07.196 --> 52:08.756
You're taking it.

53:12.094 --> 53:14.265
You're draining me.

53:14.334 --> 53:17.148
You're taking too much of me.

53:42.815 --> 53:44.855
It was just a dream.

53:44.927 --> 53:48.604
- What dream?
- The girl-- She visited me.

53:48.671 --> 53:50.678
Visited you? How?

53:50.751 --> 53:52.126
In my mind.

53:57.151 --> 54:00.185
She has some kind
of mental contact with me.

54:00.255 --> 54:01.749
She's draining me.

54:01.823 --> 54:03.678
Tell us about the dream.

54:05.248 --> 54:07.353
I can't. It's gone.

54:07.424 --> 54:09.180
It's faded.

54:09.247 --> 54:10.621
I can't remember.

54:10.687 --> 54:12.248
Have you ever been hypnotized?

54:14.336 --> 54:16.507
Do you mind if I try?

54:16.575 --> 54:19.390
Yeah, Let’s try it.

54:19.455 --> 54:24.376
- Not now. He's too exhausted.
- Fine. In the morning.

54:24.448 --> 54:28.310
Just stare at it until your eyes
feel tired, then close them.

54:28.384 --> 54:33.305
You'll feel very tired,
very sleepy.

54:33.376 --> 54:38.973
She seems to speak to me
in my dreams.

54:41.281 --> 54:42.655
She--

54:43.968 --> 54:45.375
The girl--

54:45.440 --> 54:46.815
I feel--

54:47.808 --> 54:51.125
What do you feel for her?

54:51.200 --> 54:53.753
I feel very...

54:53.824 --> 54:55.548
close to her.

54:55.617 --> 54:58.584
Is she in touch with you?

54:58.657 --> 55:01.046
I feel...

55:01.121 --> 55:03.609
as if my mind...

55:03.681 --> 55:06.169
is not entirely my own.

55:06.241 --> 55:09.624
If she is in contact
with your mind...

55:09.697 --> 55:12.283
perhaps you are in contact
with hers.

55:12.354 --> 55:13.815
Can you see her?

55:13.889 --> 55:16.442
Can you see where she is?

55:17.373 --> 55:18.748
Yes.

55:18.814 --> 55:20.756
Where is she now?

55:20.830 --> 55:24.125
A place.
I don't know the name of it.

55:24.189 --> 55:25.716
She's walking.

55:27.070 --> 55:29.557
She has a different face...

55:29.630 --> 55:31.157
but it's her.

55:31.230 --> 55:33.401
''A different face''?
How can that be?

55:33.470 --> 55:36.285
She's using a different body.

55:36.350 --> 55:39.318
- What is she doing?
- She's looking for a man.

55:39.391 --> 55:41.147
What man?

55:41.214 --> 55:44.597
Any man.
A healthy man.

55:44.670 --> 55:47.638
Does she intend to kill him?

55:47.711 --> 55:50.198
- Why not?
- She's afraid of being caught.

55:50.270 --> 55:53.402
- How could she be caught?
- The body would give her away.

55:53.471 --> 55:55.478
What is she hoping to do?

55:55.551 --> 55:58.039
She wants to...

55:58.111 --> 56:00.762
draw some energy from him.

56:00.831 --> 56:02.358
Not enough to kill him.

56:02.431 --> 56:05.727
- She can do that?
- Yes.

56:05.791 --> 56:08.474
There's another mind.

56:08.544 --> 56:10.518
Yes.

56:10.591 --> 56:12.249
The girl’s name...

56:12.319 --> 56:13.880
is Ellen.

56:13.952 --> 56:15.807
There are two people
in one body?

56:15.872 --> 56:18.261
Two minds?

56:18.336 --> 56:20.954
Ellen and the vampire?

56:21.024 --> 56:22.398
Yes.

56:24.927 --> 56:27.415
She's watching a man.

56:27.488 --> 56:29.179
What is the man doing?

56:29.248 --> 56:33.656
He's parked,
doing something with his car.

56:35.392 --> 56:37.497
Get the license number.

56:37.568 --> 56:40.863
Can you see the License number
of his car?

56:40.928 --> 56:42.303
Yes.

56:43.552 --> 56:44.927
Read it out.

56:44.992 --> 56:47.097
FMC...

56:48.705 --> 56:51.519
129E...

56:51.585 --> 56:54.203
or R.

56:54.273 --> 56:57.023
What is the make of the car?

56:58.849 --> 57:01.183
A white Volvo.

57:04.288 --> 57:06.492
What is she doing now?

57:07.809 --> 57:09.303
They're driving now.

57:09.377 --> 57:12.159
Does she ask him his name?

57:12.225 --> 57:16.960
She's pulling her skirt...

57:18.305 --> 57:19.996
over her knees.

57:21.025 --> 57:22.399
She's--

57:23.426 --> 57:24.800
He's...

57:26.146 --> 57:28.000
putting his...

57:30.465 --> 57:34.557
hand on her leg.

57:49.218 --> 57:52.480
FMC129E or possibly R...

57:52.546 --> 57:54.553
belonging to a white Volvo.

57:54.626 --> 57:57.277
The driver of the car
picked up a girl named Ellen.

57:57.346 --> 58:00.161
I have to know who the girl is
and where we can find her.

58:00.226 --> 58:02.233
She's connected with the case.

58:02.306 --> 58:05.274
I can't explain over an open line.
Thank you.

58:06.786 --> 58:08.957
Do you think he's telling the truth
about the girl?

58:09.027 --> 58:10.881
We’ll soon see.

58:10.947 --> 58:15.137
How brilliant, if she is moving
from body to body, mind to mind...

58:15.203 --> 58:18.651
taking only a small amount
of energy from each victim.

58:18.723 --> 58:21.538
It would make sense
that we're finding no new victims.

58:21.603 --> 58:23.490
She's hoping to leave no trail.

58:23.555 --> 58:27.778
If the girl is no longer in her
original body, where is her body?

58:28.803 --> 58:31.771
- Hidden.
- Let's find it.

58:32.963 --> 58:35.134
Supposing you're right
about ail of this.

58:35.203 --> 58:38.552
What about that ship up there?
What's it doing?

58:38.627 --> 58:42.686
We can't know that,
but we've got to assume the worst.

58:42.756 --> 58:44.731
Maybe they're Like
the vampires of legend.

58:44.804 --> 58:46.658
How's that?

58:46.724 --> 58:50.336
They would carry their Earth
with them, in their coffins.

58:50.404 --> 58:52.313
Wouldn’t they?

58:54.564 --> 58:57.531
- We have the feed from Hawaii.
- Here it comes.

58:57.604 --> 59:03.201
- Put it on screen number one.
- Coming in 240,000 miles.

59:04.740 --> 59:07.740
My God, it's immense.

59:26.341 --> 59:30.269
Hugh, do you have that skin tissue
sample I asked for?

59:30.341 --> 59:32.032
Good.

59:32.101 --> 59:34.916
Of course, I'll follow
containment procedure.

59:34.981 --> 59:36.355
He's here now.

59:36.421 --> 59:38.755
Send in that soldier, please.

59:42.022 --> 59:43.396
Thank you.

01:00:16.198 --> 01:00:20.126
One moment, Sergeant.
Thank you for coming.

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:22.370
I'll be with you shortly.

01:00:32.039 --> 01:00:34.373
Bloody awful job, chasing that car.

01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:37.406
It belongs to a man named
Ned Price who lives in Yorkshire.

01:00:37.479 --> 01:00:40.294
- We have him under detention now.
- What about the girl?

01:00:40.359 --> 01:00:43.654
The girl he picked up
was a nurse named Ellen, as you said.

01:00:43.719 --> 01:00:46.207
Ellen something.
He doesn't know her other name.

01:00:46.279 --> 01:00:50.208
He dropped her at Thurlstone Hospital
after spending the afternoon with her.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.535
He was reluctant to talk about it.
The man's totally exhausted.

01:00:54.599 --> 01:00:57.731
Isn't Thurlstone an asylum
of some sort?

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.734
Yes, for the criminally insane.

01:01:21.736 --> 01:01:26.471
How do you do? I'm Dr. Armstrong,
director of the hospital.

01:01:26.536 --> 01:01:28.391
Come with me to my office.

01:01:32.777 --> 01:01:35.428
- It's a cold night.
- Bitterly cold.

01:01:36.457 --> 01:01:39.108
This is the nurses' house.

01:01:39.177 --> 01:01:41.828
Ellen Donaldson is number five.

01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:43.423
Thank you.

01:01:43.496 --> 01:01:45.831
Shouldn’t I come up
and introduce you?

01:01:45.897 --> 01:01:47.752
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Come along, Dr. Armstrong.

01:01:47.817 --> 01:01:50.151
You and I have several matters
to discuss.

01:01:55.177 --> 01:01:56.868
Yes? Who is it?

01:01:56.937 --> 01:01:59.839
My name's Colin Caine.
Dr. Armstrong brought me over.

01:01:59.914 --> 01:02:02.729
I'd Like to talk to you.
May I come in?

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:13.128
Yes?

01:02:14.954 --> 01:02:17.288
- What do you want?
- My name is Colin Caine.

01:02:17.353 --> 01:02:20.168
This is Colonel Carlsen,
United States Air Force.

01:02:20.233 --> 01:02:24.489
May we come in and talk to you?
We have seen Dr. Armstrong.

01:02:33.194 --> 01:02:35.049
May I sit down?

01:02:37.994 --> 01:02:41.671
I want to ask about the man you spent
the afternoon with, Ned Price.

01:02:44.234 --> 01:02:46.951
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I think you do.

01:02:47.018 --> 01:02:49.986
- Let me see your hand.
- Beg your pardon?

01:02:54.283 --> 01:02:56.193
You're in there, aren't you?

01:02:58.378 --> 01:03:00.834
- I don't know.
- Tell me.

01:03:06.891 --> 01:03:08.746
It's gone from her.
It's in another body now.

01:03:08.811 --> 01:03:12.423
- How do you know that?
- I can see it, in her mind.

01:03:14.059 --> 01:03:17.704
She's resisting.
I’LL have to force her to tell me.

01:03:17.772 --> 01:03:21.547
Despite appearances,
this woman is a masochist.

01:03:21.612 --> 01:03:23.019
An extreme masochist.

01:03:23.084 --> 01:03:25.386
She wants me
to force the name out of her.

01:03:25.452 --> 01:03:28.103
She wants me to hurt her.

01:03:28.172 --> 01:03:32.645
I can see the images in her mind.
Do you want to stay?

01:03:32.716 --> 01:03:36.644
- Otherwise, wait outside!
- Not at ail. I am a natural voyeur.

01:03:41.325 --> 01:03:43.179
Are you in there?

01:03:51.692 --> 01:03:53.121
Are you there?

01:03:57.837 --> 01:03:59.211
Let go.

01:04:00.428 --> 01:04:01.890
Now.

01:04:52.430 --> 01:04:53.804
Well?

01:04:53.870 --> 01:04:55.878
I've got a physical description.

01:05:02.830 --> 01:05:05.164
You better send someone
to Look after Nurse Donaldson.

01:05:05.231 --> 01:05:06.605
Is she ail right?

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:09.059
If I described one of the inmates
to you, could you identify him?

01:05:09.135 --> 01:05:10.542
Possibly.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:14.666
Big man, fat, gray hair,
birthmark on his face.

01:05:14.735 --> 01:05:18.565
Jeffrey Sykes, the child murderer.
Where did you get his description?

01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:22.917
- Where is he now?
- He's in solitary confinement.

01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:24.551
He's been naughty.

01:05:24.623 --> 01:05:27.405
- What is this about?
- What we're looking for has moved.

01:05:27.471 --> 01:05:30.439
- We could be here some time.
- I better call London.

01:05:30.512 --> 01:05:33.163
- May I use your telephone, Doctor?
- Certainly.

01:05:33.232 --> 01:05:36.527
- We have to see Sykes now.
- Couldn’t this wait until the morning?

01:05:37.872 --> 01:05:39.879
ALL right, I’LL arrange it.

01:05:39.952 --> 01:05:42.123
Anything to oblige, Commander.

01:05:48.432 --> 01:05:50.374
I wish this were not so mysterious.

01:05:50.448 --> 01:05:53.743
If the police are involved,
haven't I a right to know?

01:05:53.808 --> 01:05:56.776
If you're going to start
messing about with my patients--

01:05:59.217 --> 01:06:01.900
Dr. Armstrong, I sympathize
with your position, of course.

01:06:01.968 --> 01:06:05.897
However, I can tell you
it is a matter of national security.

01:06:05.968 --> 01:06:07.343
I see.

01:06:07.408 --> 01:06:10.375
But don't you think
that I should be present...

01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:12.456
to represent the interests
of my patient?

01:06:12.528 --> 01:06:14.219
- You see--
- Can I talk to you for a second?

01:06:14.288 --> 01:06:15.663
Of course.

01:06:16.721 --> 01:06:19.339
The man has the I.Q.
of a child of four.

01:06:19.409 --> 01:06:22.857
That's a decision I shall have
to defer to Colonel Caine.

01:06:22.929 --> 01:06:26.060
Yes, of course, you can come along.
Can we start now?

01:06:26.129 --> 01:06:29.959
- What are you going to do to him?
- I'd Like to hypnotize him.

01:06:33.649 --> 01:06:35.176
What's that?

01:06:35.249 --> 01:06:37.104
Pentothal and morphine.

01:06:37.169 --> 01:06:40.781
Recommended for pre-hypnosis
and patient management.

01:06:51.346 --> 01:06:54.958
Well, he seems quiet.

01:06:55.026 --> 01:06:57.197
- We're ready when you are.
- Lamson.

01:06:57.266 --> 01:06:58.640
Sir.

01:07:20.947 --> 01:07:22.954
Can the injection be dangerous?

01:07:23.027 --> 01:07:25.132
He should have no difficulty
tolerating it.

01:07:25.203 --> 01:07:27.178
There's airways a risk, sir.

01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.138
May I have that?

01:07:30.930 --> 01:07:32.719
I’LL wake him up.

01:07:35.411 --> 01:07:37.200
- What are you doing?
- Stay where you are.

01:07:37.267 --> 01:07:40.398
He's sick, Lamson.
Help us. I can't explain now.

01:07:43.604 --> 01:07:44.978
There's our killer, Sir Percy.

01:08:13.364 --> 01:08:15.601
It's madness.

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:19.024
I want to question him.
Where can we take him?

01:08:19.091 --> 01:08:20.499
Up the ramp, sir.

01:08:38.965 --> 01:08:40.971
We need to be alone.

01:08:49.301 --> 01:08:51.210
How did you know it was him?

01:08:51.285 --> 01:08:55.475
In the nurses' quarters,
he touched me on the shoulder.

01:08:55.541 --> 01:08:57.167
I saw into his mind.

01:08:58.261 --> 01:08:59.636
What?

01:08:59.702 --> 01:09:02.997
The colonel is able to see
into the minds of people...

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.738
who have been possessed
by the girl creature, sir.

01:09:06.805 --> 01:09:11.727
It happens when I touch them.
Let's get him on the table.

01:09:20.182 --> 01:09:21.555
How--

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.913
How do you know
she's still inside Armstrong?

01:09:24.982 --> 01:09:26.957
What's to prevent her
from moving to someone else?

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.591
She's trapped.

01:09:29.782 --> 01:09:31.505
I can feel that.

01:09:31.575 --> 01:09:33.069
Are you sure?

01:09:39.863 --> 01:09:41.837
- Lamson.
- Sir?

01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:46.897
- Bring me another dose of the drug.
- One dose is usually enough.

01:09:46.966 --> 01:09:50.381
This is not a usual situation.
How Long does this stuff last?

01:09:50.455 --> 01:09:53.357
A dose Like that?
A couple of hours.

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:56.365
We’ll definitely need more.

01:09:56.439 --> 01:09:58.992
- Bring me three doses.
- Three?

01:09:59.063 --> 01:10:02.860
I’LL take responsibility.
Just get on with it.

01:10:02.935 --> 01:10:04.691
Yes, sir.

01:10:06.519 --> 01:10:08.046
Is a second dose safe?

01:10:08.119 --> 01:10:10.126
Surely it can strain his heart.

01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:15.087
Look, you don't know
what we're dealing with here.

01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:19.415
If he slips out from under,
she'll escape.

01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.215
Can you hear me?

01:10:38.456 --> 01:10:41.751
If you can hear me,
just say yes.

01:10:46.744 --> 01:10:49.908
It won't let me...

01:10:52.057 --> 01:10:53.431
talk to you.

01:11:14.617 --> 01:11:16.788
Can you see
what's holding you prisoner?

01:11:20.218 --> 01:11:23.033
Yes. She--

01:11:23.098 --> 01:11:26.065
Tell her she has to talk to me!

01:11:27.097 --> 01:11:28.472
Yes?

01:11:30.778 --> 01:11:32.949
I brought the Pentothal.

01:11:33.018 --> 01:11:34.806
Thanks. That will be ail.

01:11:41.914 --> 01:11:43.288
Hold him.

01:11:50.554 --> 01:11:51.983
There's no need for that.

01:12:10.203 --> 01:12:13.977
You in there?
Can you still hear me?

01:12:16.315 --> 01:12:19.064
Can you get into his mind,
her mind?

01:12:19.131 --> 01:12:20.790
Not with this drug.
It's Like a wall.

01:12:20.859 --> 01:12:23.444
Perhaps you've given him too much.

01:12:23.515 --> 01:12:24.922
Shut up!

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.246
Listen, you bitch...

01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:35.163
I’LL keep you in this state
for weeks if I have to.

01:12:35.228 --> 01:12:36.788
Now, you talk to me.

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.715
Carlsen, be with me.

01:12:39.932 --> 01:12:42.998
- What do you want from me?
- I love you.

01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.503
What are you?

01:12:48.572 --> 01:12:52.020
Why are you so human, so perfect?

01:12:53.084 --> 01:12:54.972
What are the bird creatures
on the ship?

01:12:55.036 --> 01:12:57.786
Our bodies are unimportant.

01:12:57.852 --> 01:13:01.649
As you and your men approached
in your ship...

01:13:01.725 --> 01:13:04.026
we changed them for you.

01:13:04.093 --> 01:13:06.646
We entered your minds...

01:13:06.717 --> 01:13:09.302
and found there new bodies.

01:13:09.372 --> 01:13:11.828
I took my shape from your mind.

01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:15.730
I took your language.

01:13:15.805 --> 01:13:18.423
I became the woman I found there...

01:13:18.493 --> 01:13:22.716
in your deepest thoughts,
your deepest needs.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:27.129
I am the feminine in your mind.

01:13:32.829 --> 01:13:35.317
Where are you?

01:13:35.389 --> 01:13:36.763
Where's your body?

01:13:37.917 --> 01:13:39.957
Let me go!

01:13:46.717 --> 01:13:48.408
Touch me, Carlsen.

01:15:21.633 --> 01:15:23.487
- It's already spreading.
- How?

01:15:23.553 --> 01:15:25.495
- You didn't stop it. It's too late.
- That's impossible.

01:15:25.569 --> 01:15:27.424
We've only been half a step
behind her ail the way.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:29.344
This gentleman stopped breathing.

01:15:30.721 --> 01:15:32.576
There's no pulse either.

01:15:42.529 --> 01:15:43.903
I think his neck is broken.

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:51.105
Prepare a stretcher for Sir Percy
and one for Dr. Armstrong.

01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:53.340
Prepare ail your remaining doses
of the drug for travel.

01:15:53.409 --> 01:15:54.784
Yes, sir.

01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:05.025
You said the thing hadn't stopped,
it was still spreading.

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:08.221
- Why did you say that?
- I don't know.

01:16:08.289 --> 01:16:11.585
Could the girl have been deliberately
leading us away from London?

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.723
Did we find ail of her victims?

01:16:14.946 --> 01:16:17.794
If there are others
besides the girl in the park--

01:16:17.858 --> 01:16:20.640
- The thing would spread.
- In a chain reaction...

01:16:20.706 --> 01:16:22.878
geometrically,
until, by now--

01:16:24.514 --> 01:16:25.888
Christ.

01:16:57.987 --> 01:17:01.599
Lieutenant, can we use the radio
to reach the S.R.C. in London?

01:17:01.667 --> 01:17:04.963
Just a moment, sir.
There's something coming through.

01:17:05.027 --> 01:17:07.296
It is the S.R.C.
for you and Carlsen.

01:17:10.468 --> 01:17:11.842
Go ahead.

01:17:11.907 --> 01:17:14.722
Can you hear me?

01:17:14.787 --> 01:17:17.755
Fallada, speak up!
I can't hear you!

01:17:18.788 --> 01:17:21.690
The two males didn't die.

01:17:21.764 --> 01:17:24.251
They jumped to the bodies
of the two soldiers who shot them...

01:17:24.323 --> 01:17:27.619
and transformed the soldiers' bodies
into their own likenesses.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:29.539
That's the difference
between them and their victims.

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:33.794
Their victims can't leave their bodies.
Only the original three can do that.

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:36.894
- But I've killed one of them.
- One of which?

01:17:36.964 --> 01:17:39.135
One of the two male vampires.

01:17:39.204 --> 01:17:43.580
- One of the transformed ones.
- How did you kill him?

01:17:43.652 --> 01:17:45.692
The old way, Carlsen.

01:17:45.764 --> 01:17:49.693
A leaded metal shaft
penetrating not through the heart...

01:17:49.765 --> 01:17:53.693
but through the energy center
two inches below the heart.

01:17:53.765 --> 01:17:56.732
Not steel, but Leaded iron.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.496
Right, Carlsen?

01:17:59.685 --> 01:18:02.981
- Are you there?
- Yes.

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:05.980
Carlsen, and you, too, Caine...

01:18:06.053 --> 01:18:07.908
it is my belief...

01:18:07.974 --> 01:18:12.414
that the vampires of legend
came from creatures such as these.

01:18:12.485 --> 01:18:15.584
Perhaps even
from these very creatures.

01:18:15.654 --> 01:18:18.109
I know it sounds incredible.

01:18:19.942 --> 01:18:21.502
Do you hear me?

01:18:21.573 --> 01:18:25.763
It's more than a belief.
It's true.

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:28.543
They visited Earth before.

01:18:30.502 --> 01:18:33.699
- What about the other male?
- He's free.

01:18:34.982 --> 01:18:37.153
- You have the girl?
- Yes.

01:18:37.222 --> 01:18:40.735
- We’ll be there soon. Hold on.
- We’ll try.

01:18:43.847 --> 01:18:46.083
- This came while you were talking.
- What is it?

01:18:46.150 --> 01:18:49.795
A scrambled cryptograph to Sir Percy
from the Prime Minister.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.678
We're to proceed directly
to the citadel at Whitehall.

01:19:32.679 --> 01:19:34.240
Lieutenant, the controls!

01:19:47.784 --> 01:19:49.693
We've lost her.
She's gone!

01:19:49.768 --> 01:19:53.565
- Where?
- Her body's in London.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.495
Where in London?

01:19:58.121 --> 01:20:01.350
You've got to tell me
what really happened on the Churchill.

01:20:03.721 --> 01:20:06.688
It wasn't Rawlings
who destroyed the radio equipment...

01:20:06.761 --> 01:20:08.452
and the ship's tapes.

01:20:09.481 --> 01:20:11.620
- It was me.
- Why?

01:20:11.689 --> 01:20:15.104
I didn't want the Churchill
to be able to reach Earth.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:17.665
And if it did, I didn't want anyone
to know what happened.

01:20:17.736 --> 01:20:19.111
What did happen?

01:20:20.137 --> 01:20:24.065
I opened her sealed
animation case.

01:20:24.137 --> 01:20:28.709
Either I did it
or she did it.

01:20:28.777 --> 01:20:31.112
I couldn’t help myself.

01:20:31.177 --> 01:20:33.184
I've never experienced such--

01:20:35.017 --> 01:20:38.148
I was in love on a level
you've never known.

01:20:43.657 --> 01:20:46.308
It terrifies me.

01:20:46.378 --> 01:20:48.866
My memory plays tricks on me.

01:20:52.138 --> 01:20:53.993
She was calling me.

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:58.630
Her power was spiritual.

01:21:28.235 --> 01:21:30.090
She wanted me, Caine.

01:21:34.475 --> 01:21:36.068
It was more than spiritual.

01:21:49.036 --> 01:21:51.338
She took some of my energy.

01:21:53.868 --> 01:21:56.486
And she gave me
some of her energy.

01:22:03.756 --> 01:22:07.531
They must have been living
off of each other when we found them.

01:22:07.596 --> 01:22:10.084
There were only three of them left.

01:22:11.692 --> 01:22:15.915
She killed ail of my men,
one by one.

01:22:17.612 --> 01:22:19.435
But I survived.

01:22:20.492 --> 01:22:24.071
She wanted me to survive.
She chose me!

01:22:25.613 --> 01:22:26.987
Why?

01:22:28.108 --> 01:22:31.142
She's not human.
She's not a woman.

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.068
She'll destroy you.

01:22:34.893 --> 01:22:37.381
She's destroyed worlds.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.307
There's something
you might want to hear, sir.

01:22:39.373 --> 01:22:41.828
A special bulletin
from the BBC.

01:22:43.053 --> 01:22:44.907
Tonight London is on the brink...

01:22:44.973 --> 01:22:46.980
of the worst devastation
since the blitz.

01:22:47.053 --> 01:22:52.104
I can see large areas of the city
burning out of control.

01:22:52.173 --> 01:22:54.661
Thousands of people are now rampaging
through the streets...

01:22:54.733 --> 01:22:58.508
in a frenzied last effort
to avoid the plague.

01:22:58.573 --> 01:23:01.061
Martial law has been enforced now
for three hours...

01:23:01.134 --> 01:23:03.589
but it hasn't stemmed
what is obviously--

01:23:55.471 --> 01:23:57.773
- Yes, we've been expecting you.
- Thank you. Carry on.

01:23:57.839 --> 01:24:00.327
- Hurry over, Sergeant.
- Right, sir.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:02.604
- Go around the other side.
- Right.

01:24:11.056 --> 01:24:12.998
Is everything ready
for the cabinet to evacuate?

01:24:13.072 --> 01:24:16.039
- Yes, everything.
- Please take a seat, gentlemen.

01:24:19.856 --> 01:24:25.006
Sir, I have Colonel Caine
and Colonel Carlsen here for you.

01:24:25.072 --> 01:24:26.632
Very good.

01:24:26.704 --> 01:24:30.414
The Prime Minister will see you shortly.
Would you care for tea while you wait?

01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:34.571
- Our business is rather urgent.
- The Prime Minister understands that.

01:24:35.632 --> 01:24:37.006
- Gentlemen.
- Prime Minister.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.599
I'm Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

01:24:38.672 --> 01:24:41.323
and I'm sure you've heard
of Colonel Carlsen of the Churchill.

01:24:41.392 --> 01:24:42.766
Yes, indeed.

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:45.386
Gentlemen, I Look forward
to hearing your report.

01:24:45.457 --> 01:24:47.366
By the way,
where is Sir Percy?

01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:48.903
Dead, I'm afraid.

01:24:48.976 --> 01:24:50.765
Oh, that's a great pity.

01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:54.892
Sir, we have information
regarding the object in space...

01:24:54.961 --> 01:24:57.481
- which is bearing down on the Earth--
- Yes, gentlemen.

01:24:57.553 --> 01:25:00.204
If you'll excuse me
just for a moment.

01:25:00.273 --> 01:25:02.695
Miss Haversham,
please come this way.

01:25:04.209 --> 01:25:05.736
Here, for a moment.

01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:07.664
I’LL be back, gentlemen.

01:25:23.154 --> 01:25:24.528
Please.

01:25:33.650 --> 01:25:35.505
Somebody get the doctor immediately.

01:25:40.210 --> 01:25:41.933
We need a doctor over here.

01:25:55.507 --> 01:25:57.133
Go!

01:26:23.315 --> 01:26:26.414
- Do you have any weapons aboard?
- No, sir!

01:26:26.484 --> 01:26:28.688
- There is a flare pistol, sir.
- Where is it?

01:26:28.756 --> 01:26:30.829
Close the breach
and it's ready to fire!

01:26:30.899 --> 01:26:32.426
Get him!

01:26:38.068 --> 01:26:41.515
While you were with the Prime Minister,
I had a call from base operations.

01:26:41.588 --> 01:26:44.720
The city is now under martial Law.
We've been placed under NATO command.

01:26:44.788 --> 01:26:46.162
- NATO?
- Yes, sir.

01:26:46.228 --> 01:26:49.360
My unit's been mobilized
to a staging area at Blackheath.

01:26:49.428 --> 01:26:52.111
Land at the S.R.C.
We've got to talk to Fallada.

01:26:52.180 --> 01:26:55.857
I'm to land at Blackheath.
The city's under air quarantine.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:57.867
If we don't do as they say,
they'll shoot us down.

01:27:03.796 --> 01:27:06.895
Zero, this is X-ray 318 requesting
clearance to land. Over.

01:27:06.964 --> 01:27:09.932
Zero, roger.
X-ray 318, you are clear to land.

01:27:19.317 --> 01:27:22.732
Come away from the aircraft!
You are under quarantine!

01:27:24.565 --> 01:27:25.710
Over here, please, sir.

01:27:27.349 --> 01:27:29.454
Don't come any closer!
Stop there!

01:27:29.525 --> 01:27:31.598
I want to talk
to your commanding officer.

01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:33.611
I am Colonel Caine,
Special Air Service...

01:27:33.686 --> 01:27:38.126
and this man is Colonel Tom Carlsen,
United States Air Force...

01:27:38.197 --> 01:27:39.823
and former commander
of the Churchill.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:46.741
Is Dr. Hans Fallada here
from the S.R.C.?

01:27:46.806 --> 01:27:50.418
- He knows who we are.
- No, not that I know of.

01:27:50.486 --> 01:27:52.558
Has anybody heard of him?

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:54.518
He must still be in London.

01:27:54.582 --> 01:27:56.687
Colonel, what exactly do you know
about what's happening there?

01:27:56.758 --> 01:28:02.028
ALL we know for certain is that
a terrible plague is sweeping London.

01:28:02.102 --> 01:28:04.819
The incubation period
appears to be two hours.

01:28:04.886 --> 01:28:09.196
Until that time has elapsed,
I cannot release you from this compound.

01:28:09.270 --> 01:28:12.369
We know what the plague is.
We are not infected.

01:28:12.439 --> 01:28:15.636
I know what I'm talking about!
We're wasting valuable time!

01:28:16.887 --> 01:28:18.513
We have totally isolated London...

01:28:18.583 --> 01:28:21.071
in order to stop further contagion.

01:28:21.143 --> 01:28:24.438
If that fails, and the surrounding
areas are threatened...

01:28:24.503 --> 01:28:26.608
Yes?

01:28:26.679 --> 01:28:30.062
sterilization by thermonuclear device
has been approved.

01:28:31.703 --> 01:28:34.452
We have this from General Ames
in Brussels.

01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:39.441
He's coming up with that decision
in just under three hours.

01:28:39.512 --> 01:28:42.032
Have you heard anything
about the ship?

01:28:42.103 --> 01:28:44.885
- ''The ship''?
- The thing from Halley’s Comet.

01:28:47.704 --> 01:28:51.184
It's parked itself in a geostationary
orbit directly over London.

01:29:09.433 --> 01:29:15.096
ALL those Little blue lights going up
toward the clouds are human souls.

01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:19.280
- How do you know that?
- I feel it.

01:29:19.352 --> 01:29:23.859
The process of conversion releases
a Life energy that can be collected.

01:29:23.929 --> 01:29:25.336
"Collected"?

01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.350
Is that what the umbrella is?
A collector?

01:29:30.425 --> 01:29:34.102
The energy doesn't go free.
It goes up there.

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:57.393
The male vampire is collecting
Life energy...

01:29:57.466 --> 01:30:01.743
but he has to send it through her
to get it up to the collector.

01:30:03.418 --> 01:30:05.272
Where is she?

01:30:06.874 --> 01:30:08.248
Over there.

01:30:09.658 --> 01:30:12.309
I get flashes
coming from her body.

01:30:12.378 --> 01:30:16.470
It's sensitive to its environment.
It picks up things.

01:30:16.539 --> 01:30:19.834
- Can you find her?
- If I can get across to the city.

01:30:21.018 --> 01:30:22.393
What about the male?

01:30:22.458 --> 01:30:25.109
He'll come if he senses I found her.

01:30:25.179 --> 01:30:28.146
She's drawing me.

01:30:28.218 --> 01:30:29.909
I've got to go.

01:30:31.354 --> 01:30:32.783
Why?

01:30:32.859 --> 01:30:35.674
She wants back
the energy she gave me.

01:30:38.619 --> 01:30:41.521
When they take on a new Life-form...

01:30:41.595 --> 01:30:44.629
they have to learn
from that Life-form.

01:30:44.699 --> 01:30:46.487
Mate with it, in a sense.

01:30:48.795 --> 01:30:50.650
The girl chose me.

01:30:52.475 --> 01:30:55.923
But when she mixed with me,
she gave me a part of herself.

01:30:58.555 --> 01:31:00.563
Now she wants that part back.

01:31:01.819 --> 01:31:04.569
Is there any sign of activity
in your sector? Over.

01:31:04.636 --> 01:31:08.084
- No, sir.
- Okay, keep me posted. Over.

01:31:08.156 --> 01:31:11.451
Colonel, listen to me. Carlsen
believes he can locate the source.

01:31:11.515 --> 01:31:13.206
There are only two carriers.

01:31:13.276 --> 01:31:16.724
If we can destroy them, it may not
be necessary to destroy London.

01:31:16.796 --> 01:31:19.284
But we only have
an hour and a half.

01:31:20.476 --> 01:31:22.003
Cease firing!

01:31:23.356 --> 01:31:26.323
Where's Carlsen?

01:31:26.396 --> 01:31:28.568
He knocked over two of my men
and took an armored land rover.

01:31:28.637 --> 01:31:30.491
Did he say where he was going?

01:31:30.557 --> 01:31:33.524
He wanted to know where
the Space Research Center was.

01:31:33.596 --> 01:31:35.451
Rogers told him,
then I was on the ground.

01:31:35.516 --> 01:31:37.523
- Right. Whose car is this?
- That?

01:31:37.596 --> 01:31:39.538
- That's the colonel’s.
- Give me the keys.

01:31:39.612 --> 01:31:43.190
- What?
- I'm commandeering the car!

01:31:43.260 --> 01:31:44.635
Give it to him.

01:31:46.076 --> 01:31:47.320
And your side arm.

01:31:50.813 --> 01:31:53.147
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

01:31:54.365 --> 01:31:56.786
Once you're inside there,
we can't allow you out.

01:32:00.445 --> 01:32:02.071
- Watch out!
- He's going in!

01:32:06.493 --> 01:32:08.500
Colonel Caine, S.A.S.
I'm crossing the river.

01:32:08.573 --> 01:32:10.908
- You don't want to go in there.
- I know I don't.

01:32:12.894 --> 01:32:16.189
Get them gates in position!
Secure this post! Move!

01:36:07.428 --> 01:36:09.283
I'm glad to see you alive.

01:36:10.308 --> 01:36:12.927
I reciprocate the sentiment.

01:36:12.997 --> 01:36:16.674
- Is he really dead this time?
- The only way they can be killed.

01:36:25.637 --> 01:36:28.158
- Where's Bukovsky?
- Dead.

01:36:29.349 --> 01:36:32.578
- How?
- Like the rest.

01:36:34.597 --> 01:36:36.735
How did you survive?

01:36:40.485 --> 01:36:44.577
- You're looking for Carlsen.
- Has he been here?

01:36:44.645 --> 01:36:47.133
No. Perhaps he misled you.

01:36:47.206 --> 01:36:50.370
- What do you know about it?
- I've been doing some more work.

01:36:50.438 --> 01:36:54.332
- Go on.
- I've discovered...

01:36:54.405 --> 01:36:57.471
there is Life after death.

01:36:57.541 --> 01:37:02.495
-How do you know?
-There is a certain mental transference.

01:37:02.566 --> 01:37:06.560
Telepathy occurs between
the vampires and their victims.

01:37:09.126 --> 01:37:13.250
- Carlsen is after the girl.
- How did you know that?

01:37:16.326 --> 01:37:19.621
- I seem to sense it.
- Where is she?

01:37:22.406 --> 01:37:24.261
Don't you know?

01:37:27.046 --> 01:37:29.861
- Carlsen knows.
- Where?

01:37:29.926 --> 01:37:33.472
She's in the cathedral.

01:37:33.543 --> 01:37:36.358
She's been there
since she escaped.

01:37:36.423 --> 01:37:39.238
Rather a nice touch,
don't you think?

01:37:39.303 --> 01:37:42.271
The crypt of kings and queens.

01:37:42.343 --> 01:37:43.870
Stay where you are.

01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:04.671
Here I go.

01:39:19.050 --> 01:39:20.960
I knew you would come.

01:40:03.467 --> 01:40:04.842
I'm here.

01:40:04.907 --> 01:40:07.842
Now can this madness end?

01:40:08.779 --> 01:40:10.634
Come.

01:40:10.699 --> 01:40:12.324
Be with me.

01:40:13.579 --> 01:40:15.401
I need you.

01:40:15.467 --> 01:40:17.834
It was airways intended...

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:19.493
you should find us...

01:40:19.564 --> 01:40:22.019
and bring us to Earth.

01:40:28.587 --> 01:40:32.646
The web of destiny
carries your blood and soul...

01:40:32.716 --> 01:40:36.099
back to the genesis
of my Life-form.

01:40:42.156 --> 01:40:43.717
Come with me.

01:43:47.825 --> 01:43:51.404
It will be much less terrifying
if you just come to me.

01:43:56.657 --> 01:43:58.218
I’LL do just that.

01:45:22.388 --> 01:45:23.763
What are these feelings?

01:45:23.828 --> 01:45:27.603
Why do I feel so close to you,
need you?

01:45:27.668 --> 01:45:31.946
Because you're one of us.
You airways have been.

01:45:32.020 --> 01:45:33.908
You're Like me.
Be with me.

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:49.544
Just a Little more.
Just a little more.

01:45:54.225 --> 01:45:56.125
Carlsen!

01:46:29.626 --> 01:46:31.826
Caine!

01:51:07.937 --> 01:51:10.837
