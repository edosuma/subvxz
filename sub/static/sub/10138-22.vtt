role model

16:06.466 --> 16:08.760
who showed him the error

16:06.466 --> 16:08.760
of his ways.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.679
Maybe he just likes me.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.098
Or that.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.058
Steph, I got to talk to you.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.185
Oh, and I have

16:16.100 --> 16:18.185
to talk to you.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.771
Ryan apologized.

16:19.813 --> 16:20.855
I know.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.398
The whole school knows.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.108
Your dad chased him

16:22.440 --> 16:24.108
down the hall

16:24.150 --> 16:25.192
clobbered him

16:24.150 --> 16:25.192
with canned ham

16:25.234 --> 16:26.736
and then shoved him

16:25.234 --> 16:26.736
in a locker.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.156
It was not a canned ham.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.156
It was spam.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.576
Y-you clobbered him

16:31.574 --> 16:33.576
with spam?

16:33.618 --> 16:35.369
I didn't clobber him

16:33.618 --> 16:35.369
with anything.

16:35.411 --> 16:37.288
Dad, you went

16:35.411 --> 16:37.288
to her school?

16:37.330 --> 16:39.290
Hasn't she

16:37.330 --> 16:39.290
suffered enough?

16:39.332 --> 16:40.875
Deej, I was there

16:39.332 --> 16:40.875
for the food drive.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.461
I bumped into Ryan in the hall

16:40.917 --> 16:43.461
and we had a little talk.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.296
You talked to him?

16:45.338 --> 16:48.341
Oh, no. W-what did you say?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.384
Nothing.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.137
Okay, I-I told him that

16:50.426 --> 16:53.137
what he did was wrong

16:53.179 --> 16:54.305
and that he was

16:53.179 --> 16:54.305
missing out

16:54.347 --> 16:56.390
on knowing

16:54.347 --> 16:56.390
a really great person

16:56.432 --> 16:57.976
and that he really hurt you.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.394
You didn't tell him I cried?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.563
No. Never.

17:00.436 --> 17:02.563
Of course not. No way.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.649
Yeah. Yeah, I did.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.067
Oh, I'm going to transfer.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.028
Steph, I'm not letting you

17:07.109 --> 17:09.028
change schools.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.238
I want to change dads.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.493
Look, I didn't mean

17:12.866 --> 17:15.493
to embarrass you.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.371
It just hurt me to see

17:15.535 --> 17:18.371
how much he hurt you.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.122
I'm sorry.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.334
I hope someday

17:20.164 --> 17:23.334
you understand.

17:25.670 --> 17:26.963
The only thing

17:25.670 --> 17:26.963
I understand

17:27.005 --> 17:28.631
is I have to go eat pizza

17:27.005 --> 17:28.631
with a guy

17:28.673 --> 17:31.676
who's only talking to me

17:28.673 --> 17:31.676
because dad threatened him.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.427
Well, Steph, just talk to him

17:33.469 --> 17:35.596
and be completely honest.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.807
Say dad was exposed

17:35.638 --> 17:37.807
to toxic cleaning fumes

17:37.849 --> 17:40.226
and has been disoriented

17:37.849 --> 17:40.226
for the past 10 years.

17:41.895 --> 17:45.356
Wait. Who says you

17:41.895 --> 17:45.356
even have to go?

17:45.398 --> 17:46.733
Hey, you're right.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.359
I mean he doesn't

17:46.774 --> 17:48.359
want to be there.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.777
I don't want

17:48.401 --> 17:49.777
to be there.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.780
I'll do us both a favor

17:49.819 --> 17:52.780
and stand him up.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.948
[indistinct murmuring]

17:53.990 --> 17:55.658
Joseph, this is beautiful.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.784
Beautiful, I'm finally going

17:55.700 --> 17:56.784
to get some rest

17:56.826 --> 17:58.202
in my own backyard.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.579
I'm gonna build the ultimate

17:58.244 --> 17:59.579

17:59.620 --> 18:01.205

18:01.247 --> 18:02.456
Check this out.

18:02.498 --> 18:04.250
Hey, stupid bird. Hey.

18:04.291 --> 18:07.003
Let's see you try to get

18:04.291 --> 18:07.003
through this, huh?

18:07.045 --> 18:08.546
Let me tell you

18:07.045 --> 18:08.546
something, okay?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.923
That bird's not gonna

18:08.588 --> 18:09.923
mess with me.

18:09.964 --> 18:11.382
He's gonna end up

18:09.964 --> 18:11.382
in a bucket of KFC.

Wo-o!

18:26.689 --> 18:28.232
Wow, Oscar's mating call

18:28.274 --> 18:29.567
is louder than usual.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.945
That's because

18:29.609 --> 18:31.945
he's found a mate.

18:31.986 --> 18:34.113
Jess, come on!

I think so.

18:46.834 --> 18:47.961
What did you do

18:46.834 --> 18:47.961
to my bird?

18:48.002 --> 18:49.503
Not half of what

18:48.002 --> 18:49.503
I'll do to you.

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
One step closer,

18:49.545 --> 18:52.214
and you're ostrich chow.

[whistles]

[squawks]

18:55.468 --> 18:57.595
Jess, you've let this thing

18:55.468 --> 18:57.595
get way out of hand.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.180
Now your blood pressure's

18:57.637 --> 19:00.180
probably off the charts.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.434
Helmet head's got

19:01.390 --> 19:03.434
high blood pressure?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.895
He ought to try to relax.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.480
That's why I was

19:05.937 --> 19:07.480
building the wall.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.566
Can we, can we please put

19:08.815 --> 19:10.566
a stop to this?

19:10.608 --> 19:13.319
I mam sure that you don't want

19:10.608 --> 19:13.319
to jeopardize Jesse's health.

19:13.360 --> 19:14.570
Well, of course not.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.656
If he croaks,

19:14.612 --> 19:16.656
I can't bug him anymore.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.366
You see that, Jess?

19:19.408 --> 19:22.161
Underneath it all

19:19.408 --> 19:22.161
she really almost cares.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.663
And I know you almost care

19:22.202 --> 19:23.663
about her

19:23.704 --> 19:25.665
so how about

19:23.704 --> 19:25.665
a truce?

19:25.706 --> 19:28.835
Well, she's got to agree to give

19:25.706 --> 19:28.835
me some peace and quiet.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.753
What's in it for me?

19:30.795 --> 19:33.172
And I'll agree to, uh,

19:30.795 --> 19:33.172
to ignore you

19:33.213 --> 19:35.008
and treat you like

19:33.213 --> 19:35.008
the irritating pest

19:35.049 --> 19:36.592
that you truly are.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.848
Well, okay,

19:38.761 --> 19:41.848
but on one condition.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.683
What's that?

19:43.724 --> 19:46.978
Give me a hug,

19:43.724 --> 19:46.978
you big galoot.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.938
I'd rather take

19:47.020 --> 19:48.938
my chances with Oscar.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.649
Jess, please.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.818
Let's stop the madness.

Come on. Give her a hug.

I'm not doing too badly.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.936
Stephanie stood me up.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.479
Oh, I'm sorry, Ryan.

20:30.521 --> 20:32.940
Must be some kind

20:30.521 --> 20:32.940
of mix-up. Come on-on in.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.400
Steph, are you home?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.944
I sat at the mall

20:34.441 --> 20:36.944
for over two hours.

20:36.986 --> 20:38.404
The guy

20:36.986 --> 20:38.404
at the piano and organ store

20:38.445 --> 20:40.781
played "Mandy" 32 times.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.785
Ryan, what are you

20:41.824 --> 20:44.785
doing here?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.328
Hmm, what are you

20:44.827 --> 20:46.328
doing here?

20:46.370 --> 20:48.455
You were supposed

20:46.370 --> 20:48.455
to meet me at the mall.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.209
Oh, listen, I know the only

20:48.497 --> 20:51.209
reason you asked me out

20:51.250 --> 20:54.628
was because my dad threatened

20:51.250 --> 20:54.628
you with canned ham.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.672
It was spam.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.927
Uh, look, your dad

20:58.049 --> 21:00.927
didn't threaten me.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.011
He just made me realize

21:02.053 --> 21:03.763
what a rat I was

21:02.053 --> 21:03.763
to stand you up.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.807
Really?

21:06.849 --> 21:10.352
And I guess I was a rat

21:06.849 --> 21:10.352
to stand you up.

21:11.520 --> 21:12.813
Well, you know..

21:12.855 --> 21:14.648
...two rats don't make a wrong.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.238
Di-didn't make a lot of sense

21:20.279 --> 21:23.116
but it kinda fit, didn't it?

21:23.157 --> 21:24.533
Listen, um..

21:24.575 --> 21:27.327
...we kind of got off

21:24.575 --> 21:27.327
on the wrong foot.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.206
Actually, we didn't really

21:27.369 --> 21:30.206
get off on any foot.

21:30.248 --> 21:33.000
Um, do you think

21:30.248 --> 21:33.000
we could start over?

I'd like that.
