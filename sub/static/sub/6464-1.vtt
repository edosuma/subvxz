05:38.040 --> 05:40.630
Because you have indeed sleepyhead.

05:40.630 --> 05:42.160
Mother departed.

06:09.820 --> 06:11.880

06:12.790 --> 06:14.800
I'm going to go shopping to the next shop.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.330

06:41.330 --> 06:44.130

06:44.130 --> 06:48.100
Ah ordinary wrote. You've been normal, right?

06:48.100 --> 06:50.230
Where possible, I'm not a kid anymore.

You blushed. As always so cute ....

06:52.630 --> 06:54.630

09:27.200 --> 09:29.730
Ga-Gal besar.

09:31.000 --> 09:35.110

09:36.430 --> 09:37.760
Failed, failed.

09:41.590 --> 09:42.630
What do you have?

09:42.630 --> 09:44.960

Eat it.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.160
Eat it?

09:53.880 --> 09:57.200
Teach me ... talk ....

09:58.460 --> 09:59.700
Shinichi!

10:00.470 --> 10:01.260
Hah?!

10:03.260 --> 10:07.830
Now the IAEA carry out an investigation into a case.

10:07.830 --> 10:11.130
IAEA.

10:11.540 --> 10:12.800
Research.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.930
IAEA.

10:17.560 --> 10:18.930
Research.

10:20.560 --> 10:24.460

10:24.460 --> 10:25.700
I'm hungry.

10:27.930 --> 10:29.960
Ah apa?

10:30.960 --> 10:31.960
Welcome back.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.660
What mother? It turns out there is no food.

10:35.660 --> 10:37.660
I'm really hungry.

10:54.380 --> 10:55.660
Although already awake,

10:57.060 --> 10:59.060
This dream never ends.

11:02.150 --> 11:05.230
Hey ... Please, can you get back into a normal right hand?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.030
If it can not now!

11:06.240 --> 11:07.830
I was gathering information.

11:07.830 --> 11:09.330
You ..., since when can talk ....

11:09.930 --> 11:12.260
Studying the Japanese language, one day is enough.

11:12.260 --> 11:13.130
Shinichi ....

11:14.130 --> 11:15.860
Shinichi later you're late loh.

11:15.860 --> 11:17.960
I was up anyway. I am fine.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.960
What's okay?

11:19.960 --> 11:21.200
Mama/Ibu,

11:21.470 --> 11:23.760
the body associated with Shinichi,

11:24.140 --> 11:27.400
from the relationship with his father who lived in this house.

11:30.700 --> 11:33.060
You know what hospital?

11:33.060 --> 11:34.760
The place where the wounded and ill treated.

11:35.210 --> 11:36.900
I'll be there and cut you!

11:36.900 --> 11:37.430
I refuse!

11:38.060 --> 11:40.900
I live on the cells that existed at Shinichi.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.700
If you do that, I would immediately die.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.030
Therefore I'm going to cut it.

11:45.030 --> 11:46.620
It will make Shinichi lose his right hand.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.760
The point like that.

11:48.510 --> 11:49.890
So what the heck?

11:49.980 --> 11:51.560
Questions used to say.

11:51.640 --> 11:52.760
Where did you come from?

11:52.760 --> 11:54.260
Coming from nowhere, and going nowhere?

11:54.420 --> 11:55.700
I was actually what?

11:55.820 --> 11:57.230
What can you give the answer?

11:57.420 --> 11:58.400
Shut up!

11:58.400 --> 11:59.930
I do not have a memory.

12:00.250 --> 12:02.100
And also failed to take the brain.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.010
Unfortunately, things like that.

12:04.900 --> 12:05.620
Brains?

12:06.200 --> 12:07.930
You're planning on taking my brain?

12:08.120 --> 12:09.230
Because I've become hands.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.600
continue the main mission, was no longer possible.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.060
Such as a feeling of despair.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.660
I should say so.

12:24.800 --> 12:28.400
Do not be changed arbitrarily, be bad if get caught.

12:28.600 --> 12:30.930
I just do the same thing with you to learn.

12:30.930 --> 12:31.800
Please?

12:31.960 --> 12:35.130
To know the world that you live in, I need a lot of information.

12:35.630 --> 12:39.000
It seems like it's not a thing that should be said right hand.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.160
Do not continue like that.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.760
Is not no one else?

12:43.130 --> 12:44.900
You're annoying once, monster.

12:45.200 --> 12:48.560
Call it, does not fit with me, I do not agree!

12:48.700 --> 12:50.030
So I had to call what?

12:50.470 --> 12:51.530
If you need the name,

12:52.360 --> 12:53.530
Migi call only.

12:54.060 --> 12:54.830
Migi?

12:57.730 --> 12:58.800
Because you're right-handed?

12:58.800 --> 12:59.600
Right.

13:00.260 --> 13:02.860
You're simple once-in-picky yes.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.500
So this exercise to kill, good move too.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.830
Do not talk like that.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.460
I want to know more. Take me.

13:25.850 --> 13:26.760
Morning.

13:26.900 --> 13:31.000
So yes, in contrast with the melee which just now. It exercises remotely huh?

13:31.000 --> 13:32.200
Arguably do not talk!

13:32.540 --> 13:34.700
Shinichi training which?

13:37.170 --> 13:38.030
I ....

13:38.500 --> 13:39.700
Not a member of any.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.230
You're late loh, Satomi ....

13:55.360 --> 13:56.300
Sorry, takes a lot.

14:00.030 --> 14:01.560
Oh, finally you come yes.

14:06.520 --> 14:09.100
Problems yesterday, I also do not like!

14:09.100 --> 14:09.830
Because ....

14:10.010 --> 14:10.530
What?

14:13.070 --> 14:13.860
Sorry.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.030
And ....

14:18.520 --> 14:20.030
It turns out there is progress.

14:21.930 --> 14:23.460
Why did you get that?

14:23.870 --> 14:25.660
Because I do not have a talent like you.

14:26.160 --> 14:26.930
That is how it is.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.330
Eh ....

14:28.330 --> 14:30.330
But, you're right love it from the first.

14:35.180 --> 14:36.130
As to.

14:36.130 --> 14:37.730
Model itu ....

14:38.740 --> 14:40.230
Could Satomi?

14:41.050 --> 14:41.680
Hah?

14:43.100 --> 14:44.330
Do not just guess.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.330
Well, it is because a woman, right?

14:46.330 --> 14:48.900
Yes ... You're not honest yes.

14:48.900 --> 14:49.530
Shinichi ...

14:50.460 --> 14:53.900
What the hell you guys are?

14:55.020 --> 14:56.230
Repaired again!

14:56.590 --> 14:57.200
Wah ?!

14:57.750 --> 14:58.660
Heh?!

15:04.030 --> 15:05.280
Sorry to interrupt.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.290
Hah?

15:20.630 --> 15:21.570
Murano Satomi.

15:23.430 --> 15:24.900
What do you know of it?

15:25.260 --> 15:26.900
I know of the change sword.

15:28.460 --> 15:29.400
This forms.

15:29.600 --> 15:31.100
Can I investigate?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.330
No kidding!

15:34.630 --> 15:36.100
I am not kidding.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.460
I'm interested in this!

15:37.460 --> 15:45.660
A, oi. ... Stop, stop. Stop!

15:50.860 --> 15:52.300
Please ....

15:56.860 --> 16:00.930
The price of 268 yen, and 980 yen this,

16:01.000 --> 16:03.130
Total 1248 yen for all.

16:24.630 --> 16:25.760
Where are we going?

16:29.860 --> 16:31.460
We will go where?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.060
For safety reasons, please keep your luggage.

16:49.730 --> 16:54.060
Do not get left behind, and check back before you go down.

16:54.060 --> 16:57.900
To stop at the next stop, please press the buzzer stops.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.130
What are you doing ?!

17:02.730 --> 17:03.600
We go down!

17:13.700 --> 17:15.500
In a place like this? What is wrong ?!

17:15.500 --> 17:17.099
There, he is there!

17:17.200 --> 17:17.960
What?

17:17.960 --> 17:19.400
The real brain eaters.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.030
Though first I understood.

17:21.430 --> 17:22.130
This ....

17:22.700 --> 17:23.560
Why?

17:25.560 --> 17:26.560
Real you?

17:26.800 --> 17:28.030
That is your friend?

17:28.030 --> 17:29.560
The distance is about 200 meters.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.330
Come on.

17:31.600 --> 17:32.760
Do not want!

17:41.160 --> 17:42.060
Hah?

17:42.060 --> 17:44.060
I-It's not like you think.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.330
I need to know the real me was how.

17:50.500 --> 17:53.200
I understand, I would go so calm.

18:05.400 --> 18:05.860
Here ya?

18:05.860 --> 18:09.100
True, the distance, 5 meters.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.200
Stupid!

18:52.860 --> 18:54.600
Arguably, stop!

19:17.500 --> 19:18.560
Friends?

19:20.760 --> 19:22.360
You've come to a good place.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.360
This place is nice loh ....

19:24.900 --> 19:26.360
By waiting alone,

19:27.560 --> 19:29.330
Next own food.

19:33.530 --> 19:35.400
This is the original body.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.330
Hm?

19:40.400 --> 19:41.560
What do you have?

19:43.200 --> 19:45.500
What was there left brain?

19:51.360 --> 19:52.800
Serious ....

19:54.800 --> 19:57.430
It's really serious ....

19:58.760 --> 20:01.760
Shinichi, flee! I feel the air to kill!

20:02.030 --> 20:04.260
You are only human, can not do anything.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.860
Shinichi!

20:14.060 --> 20:14.630
Wait!

20:16.630 --> 20:18.330
If you are planning to attack this guy, I'll kill you!

20:19.600 --> 20:21.630
Looks like I understand what you're talking about.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.960
If the main body of the dead, you also can not continue to live.

20:25.760 --> 20:30.300
So, you just have to move here.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.160
Moving?

20:32.060 --> 20:34.060
To do that, it's impossible.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.260
You did not understand ya ....

20:38.260 --> 20:41.900
It is impossible for one head with two brains.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.160
But ....

20:44.700 --> 20:47.460
If only from hand to hand, will be very easy.

20:54.430 --> 20:56.830
Look, I've cut it.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.530
Move to here.

21:00.530 --> 21:02.530
Move away from the body.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.460
From which the body will be better, right?

21:10.660 --> 21:11.600
Migi?

21:12.630 --> 21:14.800
You do not intend to follow his words, 'is not it ?!

21:19.930 --> 21:21.800
Answer, do not just stay quiet!

21:21.800 --> 21:23.560
A ... Sudahlah!

21:23.560 --> 21:26.830
I will cut off the man's head that talks so much faster!

21:44.400 --> 21:45.730
You serious ?!

21:46.000 --> 21:48.160
My body ....

21:48.900 --> 21:49.530
My body ....

21:58.430 --> 21:59.200
Dead?

21:59.830 --> 22:02.130
I also learned about the manner of killing.

22:13.860 --> 22:14.660
You ....

22:16.100 --> 22:17.830
Loh already killed your friend.

22:18.060 --> 22:19.300
There are no other options.

22:19.730 --> 22:21.500
If you die, I will die.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.500
Displacement of the body I had no proof.

22:24.300 --> 22:25.500
I survived!

22:25.500 --> 22:26.830
This is not for you.

22:27.260 --> 22:30.160
I just saved myself.

22:30.530 --> 22:32.160
And also perhaps,

22:32.530 --> 22:34.600
someday maybe I'll go.

22:34.600 --> 22:36.000
Oi ....

22:48.360 --> 22:50.130
Drinking rules written here.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.200
Tell your wife yes.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.560
Well, I go.

22:54.190 --> 22:55.430
Get well soon.

22:55.450 --> 22:56.400
Thank you very much.

23:04.260 --> 23:06.260
Soon finished, just wait.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.930
Mother go shopping first.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.200
Welcome.

23:19.200 --> 23:20.960
Please mincemeat two.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.160
All right.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.430
Why mince?

23:28.060 --> 23:29.900
Are, do not you like?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.200
What you're no appetite?

23:45.560 --> 23:47.830
Being there is a problem?

23:48.230 --> 23:48.760
Eh?

23:49.300 --> 23:51.530
Lately it seems there is something ....

23:58.430 --> 24:00.030
Soon I half 3, right?

24:01.800 --> 24:04.630
Just because the value of the lesson, so I was like this.

24:06.630 --> 24:07.600
Oh, I see.

24:12.460 --> 24:16.660
Murder that occurred in the butchery,

24:16.660 --> 24:21.130
Sakagami Kohei identified victims aged 41 years and died on the spot.

24:21.730 --> 24:24.330
Apparently it can not say to the mother.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.400
Certainly better that way.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.060
But if this continues, the victims will continue to grow.

24:30.100 --> 24:33.260
I actually want to reveal secrets about all of you.

24:33.260 --> 24:33.860
Why?

24:35.030 --> 24:37.630
Did not you know yourself?

24:37.630 --> 24:39.400
I probably would not say anything, right?

24:39.400 --> 24:40.930
You will be caught as suspects tablets.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.630
Continue to have to do?

24:47.130 --> 24:49.460
If you do not do something about your friends that ....

24:49.460 --> 24:51.460
Shinichi explanation really can not understand.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.860
My friend just eating.

24:54.400 --> 24:58.500
I just digesting the cells of your food

24:58.500 --> 25:00.960
but my friend had to find food for themselves.

25:01.830 --> 25:04.830
But they eat it man ....

25:04.830 --> 25:07.360
For Shinichi, why things like that are very undesirable?

25:07.360 --> 25:08.330
Hah?

25:08.730 --> 25:10.130
You do not understand?

25:10.460 --> 25:12.330
Human lives at stake here.

25:12.330 --> 25:14.330
The important thing was just his own life.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.760
Something valuable for me is just my life alone.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.760
Because you have just animals!

25:22.030 --> 25:25.700
That you eat cows, pigs, birds, fish and other.

25:26.030 --> 25:27.700
Even plants can you eat it.

25:28.130 --> 25:32.130
Compared with that, would not only eat human beings, the same?

25:32.330 --> 25:34.830
You're comparing it too much ....

25:34.830 --> 25:36.160
In essence, Shinichi.

25:36.500 --> 25:38.960
If you continue to give me the nutrients to live,

25:38.960 --> 25:41.760
I will fully protect you from anything.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.130
If you're going to do it,

25:45.130 --> 25:47.560
makes you just can not talk, it would be easy.

25:48.230 --> 25:49.560
Dzing. Heh?!

25:50.260 --> 25:52.260
Although I can not take the rest of the body.

25:53.800 --> 25:54.560
Eh?

25:55.500 --> 25:56.730
Very nice expression.

26:01.700 --> 26:04.430
Satan!

26:07.860 --> 26:08.930
Satan?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.430
Thank you very much.

26:20.660 --> 26:22.100
How is the result?

26:23.660 --> 26:26.130
Body parts

26:26.700 --> 26:28.430
already does not look like a human being again.

26:29.030 --> 26:29.960
Hah?

26:31.660 --> 26:32.630
The owner?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.160
You mean he ate human?

26:46.730 --> 26:48.560
Man eater ....

26:49.100 --> 26:51.800
Was found dead with a position like this.

26:52.800 --> 26:55.500
Pak Detective, what exactly is this?

26:59.030 --> 27:00.600
It makes no sense.

27:15.100 --> 27:18.760
Shinichi, after I found out about being called the devil,

27:18.960 --> 27:22.460
turns creature approaching it is human.

27:35.100 --> 27:39.660
In this way, the beginning of the new semester for you to begin.

27:39.660 --> 27:43.830
Mr hope you do not stop to keep learning.

27:43.830 --> 27:49.800
Until you can find a good future and desired job.

27:56.230 --> 27:58.800
Therefore, to you who have entered the top half,

27:58.800 --> 28:00.560
and strive to better prepare planing after this.

28:00.560 --> 28:01.630
Shinichi.

28:02.630 --> 28:03.800
I felt a presence jenisku.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.560
He was near here.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.230
Lie, right?

28:08.700 --> 28:12.900
Do not see it, he also must have known us and seek our position.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.830
There's no way if he would take the fight in the crowd as much as this.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.200
Mr. flavor is enough.

28:20.930 --> 28:26.000
So, to replace Mr. Machiyama the accident,

28:29.400 --> 28:32.330
Mr will introduce a new teacher.

28:33.030 --> 28:34.330
Please.

28:37.700 --> 28:38.530
There she is!

28:40.060 --> 28:40.960
Real ya?

28:44.760 --> 28:46.500
Do not look! We are going to get caught.

28:47.730 --> 28:49.560
Tamiya Ryouko.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.470
Please cooperate.

29:20.660 --> 29:23.000
Do not be afraid to sebegitunya.

29:23.430 --> 29:25.000
Draw near to me.

29:28.060 --> 29:31.700
Heartbeat sounds to here.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.300
Do not worry.

29:35.730 --> 29:40.230
If the fight in this place, we together will be harmed.

29:41.030 --> 29:42.230
Besides,

29:43.060 --> 29:45.700
of the intention to kill,

29:45.700 --> 29:48.230
The right hand must have known it.

29:48.230 --> 29:49.160
I Migi.

29:51.800 --> 29:55.960
Dividing the human body, is really nothing new ....

29:55.960 --> 29:57.600
I did this not because of love.

30:01.530 --> 30:02.760
You,

30:04.300 --> 30:07.260
plan what to infiltrate the school?

30:08.260 --> 30:09.260
Planning something?

30:12.560 --> 30:15.500
I just want to live normal.

30:18.030 --> 30:22.100
I want a lot of talk, but it seems impossible here.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.960
Boyfriend ....

30:33.360 --> 30:35.730
After school come with me for a while.

30:36.230 --> 30:38.960
I want to talk directly to you.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.760
Good.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.230
Offhand.

30:43.160 --> 30:44.700
I do not want to talk with you!

30:44.700 --> 30:45.560
Izumi,

30:46.260 --> 30:48.900
use good manners when talking to your teacher.

30:49.760 --> 30:50.900
Dah.

30:57.900 --> 30:59.860
Mempermainkanku day.

30:59.860 --> 31:00.930
We have to go.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.930
If he's planning something what can we do?

31:02.930 --> 31:04.930
I was surprised to like it,

31:04.930 --> 31:08.030
though it was eating his brain, he lived like a human.

31:08.030 --> 31:10.030
Maybe it could eliminate the existing problems.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.830
In addition, as a teacher he teaches something in humans.

31:13.260 --> 31:14.830
This really surprised me.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.360
I want to know more!

31:24.160 --> 31:26.600
Took me to a place like this, what would you talk about?

31:29.830 --> 31:32.130
There are two more, the distance is 10 meters.

31:32.130 --> 31:32.800
Two ?!

31:34.390 --> 31:35.400
What this means, Tamiya?

31:43.570 --> 31:45.220
Distance with them, 1 meter.

31:45.220 --> 31:46.380
See I already know.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.370
Will I introduced.

31:51.780 --> 31:53.220
Shimada Hideo.

31:54.170 --> 31:54.810
And.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.300
Same to you, a high school kid.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.360
I thought it would be convenient if you talk to each other.

32:00.450 --> 32:02.330
That is, the officer ....

32:02.330 --> 32:04.740
I do not need to know my name?

32:05.770 --> 32:06.480
In that case,

32:07.290 --> 32:09.010
call him Mr. A.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.100
Even until there is an officer.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.320
Disguise.

32:14.770 --> 32:17.740
He is Shinichi Izumi,

32:18.380 --> 32:20.540
and also Migi.

32:22.250 --> 32:24.330
Really just take the hand.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.730
That's interesting.

32:27.570 --> 32:28.730
This is not a show.

32:29.380 --> 32:32.470
What people are half-way will you enter into the Network?

32:33.180 --> 32:34.180
Tamiya Ryouko.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.500
This data is very important.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.490
Network itu apa?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.490
Already dibillang you do not talk!

32:42.250 --> 32:43.850
To survive,

32:44.260 --> 32:46.950
we need the help of fellow.

32:48.710 --> 32:49.580
Such as,

32:49.910 --> 32:52.820
find hidden places to eat everyday.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.510
In order not to look like a homicide.

32:56.650 --> 33:00.720
But lately, do not you think everything is reported?

33:01.590 --> 33:04.380
News of the amputees and the man-eating?

33:05.040 --> 33:06.380
So what?

33:07.110 --> 33:09.090
It was just you eat alone.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.810
What we are looking for,

33:11.160 --> 33:14.160
only people who are not useful alone.

33:15.640 --> 33:18.380
We were all sharing information

33:18.380 --> 33:22.070
in order to know each other. Another important thing,

33:23.190 --> 33:24.700
Network.

33:26.200 --> 33:30.090
Do not tell me, we will you enter into the Network?

33:32.280 --> 33:34.760
But I'm not entirely the same as you.

33:37.930 --> 33:40.240
We are monsters.

33:41.690 --> 33:42.820
I agree.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.740
So I conducted an experiment.

33:48.210 --> 33:53.930
I and Mr. A, having SEX.

33:55.940 --> 33:59.860
As a result, today I was pregnant.

34:00.640 --> 34:02.330
So in other words,

34:03.360 --> 34:09.929
now something that exists in this kandungaku, actually what?

34:13.170 --> 34:16.739
Because both of the human body, the contents kandunganya humans.

34:17.360 --> 34:18.360
Right.

34:18.850 --> 34:22.070
Has nothing to do with us, ordinary human infants.

34:24.040 --> 34:25.360
So that means,

34:25.830 --> 34:28.080
we actually do?

34:30.210 --> 34:37.179
Do not have the original body, just taken possession of another.

34:38.219 --> 34:40.199
Is there such a thing?

34:44.540 --> 34:52.420
Actually, for what we are born into this world?

34:53.139 --> 34:54.300
I know where.

34:54.739 --> 34:57.940
Essentially, we just want to protect themselves.

34:58.980 --> 35:01.830
I think for future cooperation.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.140
I've turned it down, right?

35:03.140 --> 35:04.410
I asked Migi.

35:07.240 --> 35:09.810
At least you do not disturb us,

35:09.810 --> 35:13.060
and do not do anything like oppose us.

35:14.260 --> 35:21.340
I can membuhuh the class within 3 seconds.

35:31.460 --> 35:34.210
Remember, if a school as hostages.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.400
Including your boyfriend.

35:47.610 --> 35:48.720
See you again.

36:07.030 --> 36:07.900
Shinichi,

36:09.320 --> 36:10.680
beware of A.

36:12.440 --> 36:14.480
He shows the intention of killing us.

37:22.250 --> 37:26.730
It turns out that a menstruating woman is not bad, it smells different.

37:27.170 --> 37:29.350
Make sure you clean the rest!

37:30.210 --> 37:32.450
Create a clean place to eat us as before.

37:32.940 --> 37:34.640
Do not you want to eat?

37:34.640 --> 37:36.840
I'm doing an experiment.

37:42.410 --> 37:46.710
Wuek, you can eat like that, not good for your body tablets.

37:47.980 --> 37:49.160
Tamiya Ryouko.

37:49.970 --> 37:53.010
Do you really plan to enter half man became colleagues?

37:54.160 --> 37:57.650
If we can think like people are thinking,

37:58.330 --> 38:00.220
Izumi Shinichi and Migi

38:00.460 --> 38:02.480
will be the subject of research.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.540
You guys,

38:06.320 --> 38:09.180
should be able to better understand this.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.490
Khususnya A.

38:12.760 --> 38:16.550
To be able to survive in this human world.

38:18.570 --> 38:19.800
I like this?

38:26.400 --> 38:30.550
The newly opened restaurant, he really tasty.

38:31.650 --> 38:33.510
Other times, going in there?

38:34.310 --> 38:35.190
Hm.

38:36.300 --> 38:39.700
No need to like it because it is trivial.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.860
We recommend that you do not often leave the house.

38:44.070 --> 38:44.790
Eh?

38:44.900 --> 38:46.880
Because many events outside the home.

38:48.530 --> 38:51.680
Because these days, rarely able to talk to you.

38:54.050 --> 38:57.880
No need to worry about things like that, later also better.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.130
Wait a minute, Shinichi.

39:03.350 --> 39:05.890
Something must have happened, right? Tell the mother.

39:05.890 --> 39:07.360
There was no nothing.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.010
Do not hide things from your parents.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.820
Did you know there was something that happened to you.

39:11.820 --> 39:14.610
I'm not a kid anymore, hiding something, it is only natural, right?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.480
Mother

39:20.660 --> 39:22.710
want to always be able to help.

39:25.760 --> 39:29.440
Keep going like that, I'm not a kid anymore!

39:34.370 --> 39:36.330
I can take care of themselves, do not worry.

40:07.040 --> 40:12.710
He prepared garlic oil, with fried minced meat that has been boiled.

40:13.540 --> 40:18.080
Your mother predicted it all, to provide what you like.

40:19.130 --> 40:21.840
Why would a mother could come to that, I want to know.

40:22.870 --> 40:24.020
There was no hubunganya with you.

40:24.020 --> 40:24.870
Anything to do.

40:25.580 --> 40:27.970
Because I got the nutrients must also be good.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.260
That's not the important thing.

40:33.510 --> 40:37.720
When I was 4 years old, I almost splashed hot oil on the head.

40:38.150 --> 40:40.240
I survived because the mother hold the spill immediately.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.550
After that,

40:44.140 --> 40:46.370
even now the scar is never lost.

40:47.810 --> 40:49.620
Sacrifice yourself, and help others.

40:50.230 --> 40:53.770
Living creature called man, really can not understand.

40:56.480 --> 41:00.710
As you previous figure, not someone else, but he's your mother, right?

41:28.420 --> 41:31.110
The distance is 20 meters. Shinichi, he's here.

41:38.980 --> 41:42.170
She A yesterday, it looks like the wait we pass.

41:47.510 --> 41:50.730
Aura kill big, he's serious this time.

42:03.750 --> 42:04.740
So I have to do?

42:05.430 --> 42:07.270
Fighting skills also seemed high.

42:07.600 --> 42:08.880
We avoid it.

42:09.450 --> 42:12.420
There is a choice of Plan A and Plan B, which one do you want?

42:13.480 --> 42:14.380
If so,

42:14.870 --> 42:15.670
Plan A saja.

42:15.670 --> 42:17.400
So first, we avoid him.

42:50.150 --> 42:51.110
You did not say anything.

42:51.940 --> 42:53.340
What you're patrolling?

42:53.910 --> 42:56.410
I'm not the same as Tamiya Ryouko.

42:57.260 --> 42:59.500
I can kill his own friends.

43:00.240 --> 43:01.270
Friends?

43:03.080 --> 43:04.140
You're friends?

43:05.210 --> 43:06.840
Why do not you let us pass?

43:08.630 --> 43:13.190
When the mutilation murder case that happened, I saw his body at police headquarters.

43:13.560 --> 43:17.820
At that time, we had to find out about the chances of that happening.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.620
Which can kill in that way,

43:23.830 --> 43:25.220
just parasites alone.

43:33.280 --> 43:34.760
You are dangerous.

43:40.340 --> 43:44.740
Attacks I leave you, we win both depend on you, Shinichi.

44:01.740 --> 44:02.610
Shinichi.

44:26.090 --> 44:27.050
Hurry!

44:30.810 --> 44:31.990
Shinichi!

44:41.360 --> 44:42.790
What is this?

44:51.060 --> 44:52.800
Her blood did not stop.

44:54.860 --> 44:58.120
Your body, it seems less protection.

44:58.940 --> 45:00.780
Of course you can impaled like that.

45:01.910 --> 45:06.950
Because you do not think that this person will perform the attack, it was your fault.

45:08.450 --> 45:11.460
What? Impossible!

45:12.870 --> 45:14.360
A man ....

45:41.720 --> 45:45.580
Why did you get like this? The body unharmed.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.950
He also uses the human body.

45:53.340 --> 45:55.320
I have killed a man!

45:55.560 --> 45:58.360
Because the brain has taken over, he was not human anymore.

45:58.360 --> 46:00.520
Why do you keep talking like that?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.440
Human thought

46:02.650 --> 46:04.630
increasingly unable to understand.

46:06.290 --> 46:07.800
Plan B, what was that?

46:08.070 --> 46:09.020
There is no such thing.

46:09.350 --> 46:10.980
It was only the option to make it easy.

46:11.410 --> 46:12.310
Hah?

46:13.570 --> 46:14.420
Welcome.

46:14.420 --> 46:15.660
2 packs of minced meat.

46:15.660 --> 46:16.700
All right.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.090
My son loved it.

46:17.980 --> 46:19.320
Oh, I see ....

46:57.120 --> 46:59.420
This body can no longer!

47:01.880 --> 47:03.960
If there is a new body,

47:05.420 --> 47:06.360
possibility,

47:07.530 --> 47:08.710
I can,

47:11.660 --> 47:12.810
move,

47:14.840 --> 47:16.220
to that body.

47:26.850 --> 47:28.560
The new body ....

47:35.180 --> 47:36.170
New.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.060
The new body.

47:50.380 --> 47:51.800
You alright?

47:53.750 --> 47:54.950
The new body!

47:56.700 --> 47:57.590
Human.

47:59.480 --> 48:00.560
Move ....

48:03.090 --> 48:04.580
Ready!

48:09.160 --> 48:11.440
Shinichi, danger! Shinichi!

48:11.440 --> 48:12.450
What the heck?

48:12.450 --> 48:13.940
150 meter.

48:16.050 --> 48:17.250
140 meter.

48:17.770 --> 48:18.940
Getting closer.

48:19.340 --> 48:20.800
There are more?

48:21.110 --> 48:23.050
Having had now no more?

48:26.220 --> 48:27.500
30 meter.

48:30.580 --> 48:31.670
20 meter.

48:32.490 --> 48:35.220
I could beat, beat, beat ....

48:35.220 --> 48:36.180
10 meter.

48:39.730 --> 48:40.360
What is wrong?

48:40.360 --> 48:43.330
He stopped in front of the house.

48:44.520 --> 48:47.200
Seriously ....

48:57.960 --> 48:59.200
Lest ....

49:04.950 --> 49:06.160
He was in.

49:06.460 --> 49:08.160
Why he can bring this house keys?

49:08.160 --> 49:09.340
This feeling ....

49:24.440 --> 49:25.570
Mother?

49:30.080 --> 49:31.270
Shinichi, instead.

49:31.720 --> 49:32.680
Mother, right?

49:32.680 --> 49:33.780
Dia adalah A!

49:34.020 --> 49:36.040
What are you saying? A dead, right?

49:37.840 --> 49:38.690
Mother.

49:39.030 --> 49:39.700
Welcome.

49:39.700 --> 49:41.090
It was A, Shinichi realized!

49:41.090 --> 49:42.200
Be still, Migi!

49:42.200 --> 49:44.730
He took off his old body, and took the body of your mother!

49:44.730 --> 49:47.280
Do not go around you to say things like that!

49:47.280 --> 49:48.950
Realize, Shinichi!

49:49.460 --> 49:50.800
So it could be so ....

49:52.490 --> 49:56.500
It turns out that I took this human body,

49:59.080 --> 50:02.310
Mother ..., I'm sorry!

50:02.810 --> 50:05.440
Do not joke like that mother, stop!

50:05.440 --> 50:06.840
Realize, Shinichi!

50:07.130 --> 50:08.890
Your mother is not a human being!

50:08.890 --> 50:11.670
I told you to shut up, right? The monster it was you!

50:13.300 --> 50:14.380
Mother ....

50:15.370 --> 50:16.730
Sorry to have to hide it.

50:18.620 --> 50:19.640
I just,

50:20.200 --> 50:24.620
fear mother will worry about everything, so I did not tell him.

50:26.200 --> 50:28.660
I'm looking for the right time to talk about it.

50:29.770 --> 50:35.370
Because I was whiny and weak, so I can not keep making the mother worried.

50:36.520 --> 50:38.320
I actually always wanted to thank you.

50:38.780 --> 50:41.260
From the beginning I just did not dare say it.

50:42.290 --> 50:43.130
Therefore,

50:43.660 --> 50:45.820
say if the mother was worried!

50:49.910 --> 50:50.850
Mother ....

50:52.570 --> 50:53.740
Shinichi!

51:14.680 --> 51:15.700
Shinichi!

51:16.090 --> 51:17.360
Shinichi!

51:19.520 --> 51:24.020
His heart had I crushed, man it's over!

51:25.110 --> 51:27.560
You will also die with him.

51:28.480 --> 51:31.940
Because you can not take the brain of the man.

53:13.230 --> 53:17.880
Finally, it was discovered the original value of everything.

53:18.980 --> 53:24.280
To discuss anything, this formula can be used in accordance with the orders.

54:57.280 --> 54:59.700
You could wake up? It's a miracle.

55:01.400 --> 55:04.780
I use a piece of me to cover up the holes that exist in the body.

55:05.060 --> 55:09.900
Then I left one of my share in your heart that have been destroyed and do not move!

55:10.640 --> 55:14.240
Thus, I slowly back into the right hands.

55:15.040 --> 55:18.200
It was like a living experiment also my death, but Alhamdulillah successfully.

55:21.000 --> 55:25.630
If I die ... it's better!

55:32.140 --> 55:33.520
Mother ....

55:38.620 --> 55:42.020
Forget it! He's been taken over by A!

56:12.940 --> 56:16.580
4 days you do not go to school I thought you why.

56:19.500 --> 56:20.580
Shinichi?

56:22.880 --> 56:24.180
You do not have any?

56:28.540 --> 56:29.840
Where are you going?

56:32.180 --> 56:32.910
Shinichi!

56:32.910 --> 56:34.170
Do not follow me.

56:37.480 --> 56:38.660
Shinichi!

56:48.680 --> 56:54.360
Near the house, police found the bodies. It was on the news.

56:55.200 --> 56:56.400
What's that you act?

56:56.400 --> 56:57.680
Di mana A?

56:57.680 --> 56:59.220
Did you have to kill him?

56:59.220 --> 57:02.760
At first it's like that, but he lived after moving into Shinichi mother's body.

57:03.300 --> 57:05.160
I and Shinichi have also been killed.

57:06.880 --> 57:10.420
So for 4 today, you fix the cells huh?

57:10.420 --> 57:11.500
A no where?

57:11.500 --> 57:12.660
I do not know.

57:12.660 --> 57:14.680
Do not lie! You were his Network, right? !!

57:14.680 --> 57:16.080
Though I know,

57:17.200 --> 57:19.460
I will not tell on you!

57:19.460 --> 57:21.180
So you are beniat hide your friend?

57:21.900 --> 57:25.820
We all have a personality of their own.

57:27.180 --> 57:31.540
A has a strong personality, so he included dangerous.

57:31.540 --> 57:35.020
You know that, then why introduce A on us?

57:39.500 --> 57:41.000
Experiment.

57:41.930 --> 57:43.660
Just an experiment.

57:45.030 --> 57:46.550
Only experiment?

57:48.530 --> 57:50.950
You're doing all just for that ?!

58:04.530 --> 58:05.920
Bold?

58:09.920 --> 58:11.650
If you dare to like it,

58:12.530 --> 58:14.180
there seemed no choice.

58:27.430 --> 58:28.660
I will

58:30.070 --> 58:31.510
a little hard.

58:35.730 --> 58:37.000
Interesting ....

58:38.420 --> 58:41.060
You two really interesting.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.380
Wait!

58:52.230 --> 58:56.660
Looks like we'll meet again, Izumi.

59:16.480 --> 59:18.320
Somehow, I have to find it.

59:20.740 --> 59:22.900
Whatever is going to happen, I would have found it!

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Kill!

59:42.100 --> 59:43.000
Pak Iwa.

59:43.000 --> 59:43.650
Huh?

59:43.960 --> 59:48.180
How to kill the victim like that? Secondhand goods is not found at the crime scene evidence.

59:48.180 --> 59:52.310
And also, how the perpetrators to destroy the back door like that?

59:54.070 --> 59:55.380
It is also true ya ....

59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.840
About the victim at the scene,

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:04.340
organs such as participating interest with his head.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:06.240
What is such a thing possible?

01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:08.480
Do not you know?

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:11.510
Now I'm eating.

01:00:13.590 --> 01:00:15.560
But you also see this photo?

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.460
Thus, the culprit is not human ya ....

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.500
Like a man who takes it.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:30.080
To investigate this, we may have to ask for help from above as well.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:39.200
This is the station that we had never visited,

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.130
Where are you going?

01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:43.970
I do not know, today just want to walk alone.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:46.420
What do you think will meet with A?

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:48.530
You've got radar.

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:50.820
This is not an effective way.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:53.430
If you want to meet with A in this state ....

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.090
What is here?

01:00:57.320 --> 01:00:59.350
Jarak 200 meter.

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:00.610
Apakah A?

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:01.460
I Have No Idea.

01:01:02.150 --> 01:01:03.170
But, Shinichi ....

01:01:03.810 --> 01:01:05.190
He was not just one or two.

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.010
The reason is simple.

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:19.750
Is it in this crowd?

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:21.590
I can not feel it clearly.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.410
There seems to be around this.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.850
Really ?!

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:26.660
Shinichi.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.690
What?

01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:30.020
In this crowd,

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.620
among this crowd ....

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.710
A no, but ....

01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:54.280
They nyalon mayor huh?

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.050
This is surprising.

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:05.170
Once I was surprised by Tamiya Ryouko that to be a teacher, and now they want to be a group leader.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:10.420
So they want to create a place where people can eat it?

01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:16.000
Control of the town, then have a place to group them together. No one yet!

01:02:16.310 --> 01:02:21.280
They in recent months, it has become highly evolved group.

01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.880
You're too eager to bentukmu not clear so!

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:30.600
Maybe someday, parasites like we'll really be able to master the human world.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:32.740
Do not talk casually.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.910
Did monster could do that?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.800
You underestimate the human race.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:51.080
Izumi Shinichi, 'kan?

01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:53.970
Yes, right.

01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.620
So, now you live alone?

01:02:58.970 --> 01:03:00.150
And.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:03.320
You cook it yourself?

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:04.970
Sometimes.

01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:08.250
What about your life now?

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:12.920
Because there is money from the mother, so ... it's ....

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.370
You're worrying ....

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.920
At some time ago, there were cases of police being killed, right?

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.170
You know something?

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.420
Nothing.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:58.620
So.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.920
Because you're still in school yes.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:08.220
Already, thanks.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:25.150
Migi!

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:39.470
Morning.

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:44.120
It looks like being difficult yes.

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.500
Hopefully your mother quickly meet ya.

01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:51.420
What about your food?

01:04:52.070 --> 01:04:52.970
No problem.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:54.400
If difficult,

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.000
I'll make.

01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:59.750
Someone is coming.

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:07.570
Morning ....

01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:13.900
He Shimada were transferred to our class.

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:17.020
I Hideo Shimada, Greetings.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.420
Ah?

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.460
What your right hand can not handshake?

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.020
For what have you come here?

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.700
What are you saying?

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.120
We wish you good friends yes.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:01.080
What are you doing?

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.040
Dah.

01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.480
What are you doing?

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.020
Only test his strength alone.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.420
Morning ....

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.880
Again fight ya?

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:25.060
No, not like that.

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:28.360
Hey, so that just the transfer student huh?

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:46.140
It evokes memories, right?

01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:51.460
Besides Murano Satomi also do not know what really happened.

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.660
Offhand!

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:59.500
It looks like the power of the human body increases dramatically.

01:06:59.860 --> 01:07:04.640
Because the body Migi, so influenced the development of the human side.

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:09.280
Basically he was not supposed to get like that.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:14.620
Turns out, he's really serious.

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.960
She really interesting yes.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.980
I so understand why you're up to investigate them.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:23.800
Only to see its potential,

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.760
and he even became a very important part.

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.180
After meeting him, I kept kepikiran with A.

01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:43.460
I told you when the heart is destroyed,

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.040
I use my cell to restore it.

01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.680
Part of it was apparently still alive.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.400
Flow with blood.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.080
So would you take it?

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:55.320
As a result, my cell was fused with the body.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.140
It is not possible for me to take it again.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:07:59.480
So what?

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:02.480
My body seemed to be like you.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.440
Real trouble.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.620
Moreover, now where are you going?

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.160
Today I will be a little sightseeing.

01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:14.640
You're looking for a case that is not clear anymore. You're changing not only in body but also your personality.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.180
I want you to stop.

01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.460
I can not stop.

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.859
If you see her, nothing could be done.

01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:23.880
The dead will not come back, so think about your life.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:25.880
Besides ....

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.920
Actually, no matter what happened to me.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:32.080
The problem?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:36.640
After that day, 4 hours a day I have to actually fall asleep.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:37.979
I even slept 8 hours.

01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.939
Unlike me to sleep, but unconscious.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.080
Maybe even as I have died at that moment.

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.880
And also it can happen at any time.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:52.580
So, if the enemy comes when you sleep ....

01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:54.520
You have to fight for what you can run.

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:55.600
Hah?

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.399
Welcome.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:56.939
Eh?

01:08:56.939 --> 01:08:57.740
Sleepy!

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:58.300
Woi!

01:08:58.300 --> 01:08:59.420
Sorry I'm going to bed.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.479
Oi. Tunggu! Oi! Oi!

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.020
How to identify parasites?

01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:16.080
From the results of the autopsy, all the parts in need of intake.

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.359
Then came this conclusion.

01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:20.920
Sick!

01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:24.479
Apparently it did not happen.

01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:50.560
What?

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:54.760
I told you not to provoke the suspicion of others.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.560
Looks like they found a way to distinguish us, simply by pulling the hair only.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.560
That would be a problem.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.840
Is not this because you're too often play with things that interest you?

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.420
You'd better kill it.

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:09.420
I am grateful that you have been warned.

01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.960
But it was not the existence of the harm.

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.340
On the other hand,

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.860
precious samples.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.800
If you do the experiment,

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.640
I want you not to harm all.

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.860
I

01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:28.600
also think about life and the future of my friends.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.260
If later I was elected,

01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:35.580
I will make man subordinates, and improve the system.

01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.140
Do not be too worried.

01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.220
Bu Tamiya.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.320
How's your son?

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.060
Can already moving.

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:53.680
Her body was developed as an ordinary human.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.200
Hey, how about your eating during this time?

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.900
Never mind, I'm normal.

01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.480
You're cold. Ih sucks ....

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.900
He has a point, the food was good for health. Obviously for me, too.

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:32.040
Seneake own.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.800
And this is also an opportunity to approach.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.760
You're always talking about it.

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.540
What did you whisper-whisper?

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.540
No, it's nothing.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.700
Shinichi lately a little scary.

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:47.740
Eh?

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.140
I understand a little bit because the incident happens.

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:57.120
I think you really have changed, not like before you were a bit shy and a bit wishy-washy.

01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:00.040
But, it makes you interesting.

01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.820
What the heck is it?

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.360
Now I'm calm.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.240
It turns Shinichi Shinichi remains.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:17.120
What?

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:18.880
I thought I heard voices.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.240
Sorry.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.380
Danger!

01:12:56.300 --> 01:12:57.280
Off.

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:00.500
He is dead.

01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:15.440
What are you doing?

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:18.000
Do you understand what you're doing?

01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:21.460
Let alone free of garbage trucks.

01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:23.250
Do not say things like that!

01:13:23.970 --> 01:13:25.120
Pity tablets.

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:28.740
But he was already dead.

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.960
Not to mention the dog dead dog.

01:13:33.170 --> 01:13:34.960
Just a blob of flesh resembling a dog.

01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.000
You ....

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:45.680
Shinichi I know, right?

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.970
You know why?

01:14:00.100 --> 01:14:01.330
Sorry.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.130
Looks like I was wrong person.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:18.720
As Migi.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.810
What is wrong with me?

01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.810
Meat that make up the dog,

01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.450
The same with the usual word I say.

01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.260
Oh, I see?

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:34.540
He seems to hate me ....

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:45.010
Ano, Bu Tamiya ....

01:14:46.570 --> 01:14:47.940
Yes, What is up?

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:54.450
It was ... I wonder why?

01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:57.360
You're pregnant huh?

01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.480
So what?

01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.560
Well ... maybe I should say a word about so quickly but,

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.740
Can you come to the principal's office?

01:15:43.140 --> 01:15:44.810
Ah, you're home?

01:15:46.740 --> 01:15:47.780
We just went in.

01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.440
Welcome.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:57.040
Because suddenly you'll be surprised yes.

01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:03.400
Yes it's true ....

01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.780
We got the news from school.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.000
Father ....

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.440
Hm?

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:21.640
Not.

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.080
He was not Ryouko.

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:27.880
Not Ryouko!

01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.880
What are you saying?

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.340
Father, call the police, call the police quickly.

01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.340
Oi, are you okay?

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:34.460
Father ....

01:17:19.220 --> 01:17:24.240
This is me. I want to give two meat for food.

01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:17.260
You're out of school?

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.980
I also expect this will make me released.

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.560
Do not you just replace such a course?

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:27.060
I also heard there that will keep watch over you.

01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.720
In addition, he has been quite correct in recognizing this human world.

01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:33.460
What do you mean?

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:41.080
Me and him, feed on humans has been rare.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:43.220
Shimada also?

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.140
For now, it seems there is no problem.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:53.960
If no one can determine that we can live without eating human,

01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:56.260
the problem is solved, right?

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.160
And it is very possible.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.500
So Shimada, too.

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.080
If you can adapt to the human world such as, meaning there is no problem anymore ....

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.460
Wait a minute.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.280
Is not he also take the human body?

01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:15.380
In addition, what you say, I can not believe it.

01:19:23.950 --> 01:19:24.740
They.

01:19:30.600 --> 01:19:32.220
I asked her to be a model.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:34.900
Satomi also want to come?

01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:36.410
Ah, never mind.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:39.530
To.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:40.050
Hm?

01:19:40.050 --> 01:19:41.720
What is the relationship with Shinichi okay?

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:42.740
Hah?

01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:45.020
Heh. I do not see what you mean.

01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:51.680
So, let's go to the next pose.

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:54.880
In that case ....

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.600
Hand here.

01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:57.460
Hold.

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.160
Sliding a bit.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:00.120
Facing here.

01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:01.920
Sip. No.

01:20:03.780 --> 01:20:07.920
Are you really could like anything ....

01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:11.100
Like you're not human.

01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.900
Kidding.

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.920
What are you doing?

01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.220
Though already walked away up here.

01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:00.620
8 people.

01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:29.940
You're listening to something?

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:34.820
Hideo Shimada, he issued aura to kill!

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:37.960
It's still in school loh ....

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:39.340
Shimada no where?

01:21:39.340 --> 01:21:41.160
We do not need to come to deal with it!

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.680
As if would I listen to that!

01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.480
I will do the same.

01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:08.140
If you move will be pain tablets.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.260
So please remain silent.

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:43.180
Let's run!

01:22:45.020 --> 01:22:47.580
Fast, do not say anything!

01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.520
That way.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:12.240
Unmistakably it comes from the art room.

01:23:13.060 --> 01:23:18.480
And also the aura of killing Shimada was really real. Do not go near! Do not go near!

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:19.720
Shinichi!

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.140
Watch out! Move!

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:57.700
Calm down, Shinichi!

01:23:59.650 --> 01:24:02.860
Can not, I can not ....

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:04.600
Think normal.

01:24:04.600 --> 01:24:05.880
I-Ini ....

01:24:07.210 --> 01:24:08.320
Classmates ....

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:09.600
It's okay, Shinichi.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:11.570
Your heart will not be punctured again.

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:13.850
You have to be calm.

01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:18.620
You may, quiet.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:30.320
He really lost control.

01:26:34.610 --> 01:26:35.740
We must defeat him!

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.220
There are more ....

01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:44.620
Tamiya ....

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.900
Shimada Hideo.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:52.690
You're doing something to excess.

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:59.410
A-I blood loss and can not regenerate.

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:02.730
Help me ....

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:06.000
Friends who make a fuss, I hate!

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.810
Shinichi, run!

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:16.940
Wake up!

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:52.290
Now it's not okay, Satomi.

01:27:56.380 --> 01:27:57.930
Did he go to the west?

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.770
We are just past the stairs.

01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:03.690
Surveillance will be continued.

01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.610
Be careful. Roger.

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.010
Hoi!

01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.530
Hoi ...!

01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:13.570
You!

01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:53.460
Shinichi, this may be surprising.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:55.260
But Shimada still emit an aura.

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.840
He's heading to the roof.

01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:12.130
It turns ordinary people impossible.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:41.570
Bye ....

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:43.850
Shimada!

01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:16.760
Shinichi, here.

01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:31.000
For a while I was going to disappear.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:34.650
Why do you berpura2 like that?

01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:37.760
Killing 13 people.

01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:42.450
It is supposed to be from the beginning I kill and Shimada.

01:31:42.450 --> 01:31:45.240
If you kill me, son die in my stomach.

01:31:48.450 --> 01:31:50.290
What you can kill a human child?

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.140
Tamiya Ryouko ....

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:54.460
Allow a human being would

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.080
do you care?

01:31:58.690 --> 01:31:59.820
It also

01:32:00.860 --> 01:32:01.980
an experiment.

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:04.450
Stop it!

01:32:04.450 --> 01:32:05.770
Izumi Shinichi.

01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:10.180
A mother

01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:13.020
is the existence of the unknown.

01:32:15.340 --> 01:32:16.850
To become a mother,

01:32:17.990 --> 01:32:19.650
I have chosen to undergo this.

01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:23.670
What he uses great strength?

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.030
I want to know it.

01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:36.300
A,

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:38.200
there is at this address.

01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:40.710
There?

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:42.250
And.

01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:04.300
Do not dally.

01:34:06.000 --> 01:34:06.970
I understand!

01:34:24.120 --> 01:34:25.280
His body is still the same.

01:34:26.230 --> 01:34:27.410
Using the mother's body.

01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:29.410
I'll take off his head.

01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.000
Migi hear ....

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:33.200
Shinichi.

01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.010
There is a serious thing to happen.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:36.380
We retreat.

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.200
Ha? What are you saying?

01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:40.730

01:34:41.280 --> 01:34:41.990

Can not bearable anymore.

01:34:44.580 --> 01:34:45.840
Why should it now?

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.150
I myself can not arrange this.

01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:49.730
Come retreat.

01:34:49.730 --> 01:34:51.490
Oi, is in sight!

01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:55.760
Then fight.

01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:57.130
Oi, Migi!

01:34:58.360 --> 01:34:59.690
Things I can do,

01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.100

01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.730

01:35:13.860 --> 01:35:15.720
Why are you still alive?

01:35:22.010 --> 01:35:23.050
Alright.

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:38.930
Humans can not move so, what happened?

01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:42.150
Mother, now I'll let you go.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.460
Stop, Shinichi.

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.210
You know why? This mother ....

01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:35.560
Mother ....

01:37:02.370 --> 01:37:03.480
Looks like you succeed.

01:37:05.370 --> 01:37:06.540
Again, again,

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:10.680
mother saved me.

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:14.280
Oh, I see.

01:37:16.040 --> 01:37:17.170
But, Migi ....

01:37:19.530 --> 01:37:20.620

This my be just like you.

01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:30.630
When Mother was taken before this,

01:37:32.730 --> 01:37:33.590

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.120
Is Homura selected?

01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:17.500
I Have No Idea ....

01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.640

01:38:54.530 --> 01:38:55.360

01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:57.280
We will also help.

01:38:57.280 --> 01:38:59.280
I want the information that has been obtained.

01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:02.820
Please sign here.

01:39:05.170 --> 01:39:07.050
This letter of agreement.

01:39:08.140 --> 01:39:12.420
The title, a plan to protect the human race.

01:39:13.050 --> 01:39:14.200
Are you?

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:18.970
Sorry. I think of the special forces, Yamaga.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.620
Special forces?

01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.600
Maksudmu SAT?

01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:11.770
If the number of humans could be reduced by half,

01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:17.250
possible number of forest burnt by half?

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:22.760
If the amount of a human being than a hundred,

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:28.660
Could the existing waste, become one in a hundred as well?

01:40:29.970 --> 01:40:31.380
Seeing it again?

01:40:32.890 --> 01:40:34.450
Is not it surely?

01:40:35.540 --> 01:40:38.260
Someone in the world is definitely bepikir so.

01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:43.160
if you want to save the lives of others.

01:40:46.050 --> 01:40:47.770
So that is yes.

01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:51.330
Yes, Dad ....

01:40:53.140 --> 01:40:56.680
Although the study did not say, but they know how to talk.

01:40:57.820 --> 01:40:59.920
Although the study did not move,

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:02.060
but know how to move.

01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:05.180
All living things,

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:07.680
only obey orders only.

01:41:12.660 --> 01:41:13.720
Command?

01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:19.380
When we take the brain,

01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.880
I get the order.

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:24.280
Like what?

01:41:40.530 --> 01:41:41.650
To

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.690
to kill this man.

01:42:19.050 --> 01:42:19.860
Migi ....

01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:21.860
What?

01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:25.400
I now understand.

01:42:27.380 --> 01:42:28.650
The thing to do.

01:42:31.290 --> 01:42:32.480
Things to do?

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.570
People like anything else there are associated.

01:42:49.540 --> 01:42:54.650
I just need to find the parasite, then kill them one by one.

01:42:56.740 --> 01:42:58.820
That's the thing to do!

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.850
If we are born to destroy mankind,

01:49:06.170 --> 01:49:08.370
He is the hope.

01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.650
The leader of the parasite, want the child dead!

01:49:17.310 --> 01:49:19.710
Failed to eat your brains, I'm grateful.

01:49:19.710 --> 01:49:24.540
O the garbage man, that there is a world. Are not you barging everything ?!

01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.480
Everybody in this world wants to expectations.

01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:29.880
If the lives of all people are protected ....

01:49:30.090 --> 01:49:32.250
Shinichi is human.

01:49:34.100 --> 01:49:35.500
I have to find them!

01:49:35.170 --> 01:49:36.350
So, flee ....

01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:45.720
Migi!
