00:00.135 --> 00:01.664
<i>[girl] Previously on The Fosters...</i>

00:02.023 --> 00:03.356
- I can't!
- What's wrong?

00:03.391 --> 00:06.159
<i>[Callie] We tried to have sex, I
freaked out, like a panic attack.</i>

00:06.194 --> 00:08.862
- I was raped. Yeah.
- That guy who... ?

00:08.896 --> 00:11.965
<i>I thought I put it behind me
but I still have some stuff</i>

00:12.033 --> 00:15.001
- I have to work through.
- Take as long as you need.

00:15.036 --> 00:19.539
<i>- [man] Lena gonna be ok?
- [woman] Yeah, now, but she lost the baby.</i>

00:19.574 --> 00:21.575
[sobbing]

00:21.609 --> 00:23.710
You're just so good, you
make the rest of us look bad.

00:23.744 --> 00:25.612
Well, there's nothing I can do about that.

00:25.646 --> 00:28.648
Well, I mean, you could try to
blend in. This is a dance team.

00:28.683 --> 00:30.584
What? Should I dye my hair?

00:30.618 --> 00:35.288
<i>[Stef] We got a letter from Ana. She
wants to see the twins to make amends.</i>

00:35.323 --> 00:37.290
<i>[Lena chuckles] Oh, wow. What did you do?</i>

00:37.325 --> 00:39.292
<i>[Stef] I called Mike and I told
him that she's never coming anywhere</i>

00:39.327 --> 00:41.127
<i>- near our kids ever again.
- Good.</i>

00:41.232 --> 00:43.433
Girls! Everyone out! Out of the house!

00:43.467 --> 00:45.168
Where's Becca? Becca?!

00:45.202 --> 00:47.237
- Got her. Clear away!
- She is gonna be ok.

00:47.271 --> 00:49.406
[sirens blaring]

00:51.142 --> 00:53.243
[pop music]

00:53.277 --> 00:56.846
- [groans] I seriously have like nothing to wear.
- [chuckles]

00:56.881 --> 00:59.049
And Mat won't tell me where we're
going so I don't know what to wear!

01:02.119 --> 01:05.087
- Too Big Bird?
- I don't think you're not big anything.

01:05.122 --> 01:06.723
More Tweety Bird.

01:06.817 --> 01:10.720
Ha-ha. Seriously.

01:10.755 --> 01:14.691
[sighs] I need something
like, sexy but not too sexy,

01:14.725 --> 01:16.626
soft but not easy,

01:16.661 --> 01:18.495
that says I'm a girl, but
don't treat me like one.

01:18.529 --> 01:21.531
Right, so you're looking
for really pretty armor?

01:21.565 --> 01:24.367
No. I just...

01:24.402 --> 01:28.738
Mat can be a little confrontational.

01:28.806 --> 01:31.060
Ok, a lot confrontational. I mean,

01:31.061 --> 01:33.510
the boy feels the need to
say everything he thinks.

01:33.547 --> 01:37.183
So I wanna be pretty but protected.

01:37.218 --> 01:39.519
Attractive, just not vulnerable.

01:41.122 --> 01:44.424
Yeah. Like you.

01:48.295 --> 01:51.197
- You want some syrup for that, bud?
- Mm-hm.

01:51.232 --> 01:54.267
- Since when do you work Sundays?
- I'm escorting a funeral.

01:54.301 --> 01:56.336
Since Mama and Jude aren't
gonna be back until tomorrow,

01:56.370 --> 01:58.238
I thought I'd pick up a
little off-duty security work.

02:00.007 --> 02:03.777
Unless you don't want me to go.

02:03.811 --> 02:06.079
That fire was pretty intense.
I can cancel, you know.

02:06.113 --> 02:08.914
No, no. I have therapy anyway. I'm fine.

02:08.949 --> 02:10.717
Ok. You sure?

02:10.751 --> 02:13.686
- Yeah, I'm just happy everyone got out safe.
- Yeah.

02:13.721 --> 02:15.789
Where's everybody now?
All the girls, I mean?

02:15.823 --> 02:17.757
They went back to juvie,

02:17.792 --> 02:20.493
until they can find a new
place, if they can find place.

02:20.528 --> 02:22.061
What does that mean?

02:22.096 --> 02:26.533
Well, I guess there aren't many landlords
who wanna rent to a group home, so...

02:26.567 --> 02:28.334
Well, I'm sure they'll find
something. Rita doesn't strike me

02:28.369 --> 02:30.603
as the type of person
who'd gives up easily.

02:31.772 --> 02:33.640
[Jesus] So what time is
the funeral gonna be over?

02:35.195 --> 02:38.220
Planning another party?

02:40.414 --> 02:42.515
Whaddaya mean?

02:42.550 --> 02:46.019
I was just asking. I have
a big paper I'm writing.

02:46.053 --> 02:48.054
It'd be easier to have no
one here to distract me.

02:48.088 --> 02:51.357
Well I have a music thing with
Lou downtown, so I won't be here.

02:51.392 --> 02:55.962
Oh yeah? Why don't you... maybe
you could take Callie with you.

02:55.996 --> 02:58.031
Oh no, I don't wanna crash your thing.

02:58.065 --> 03:01.801
It's not a thing. We're just
hanging. You should come.

03:01.836 --> 03:04.523
- Really?
- Yeah. I could pick you up after therapy.

03:04.538 --> 03:08.007
Um, ok, well I'll think about
it. I'll call you after I'm done.

03:08.042 --> 03:09.642
Ok.

03:09.677 --> 03:12.612
Hey Miss Thang. Nice jacket.

03:12.646 --> 03:14.581
Cute, right? Thank you.

03:14.615 --> 03:16.616
Like I had a choice.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.885
When are Mama and Jude coming
home? At least they're nice to me.

03:18.919 --> 03:21.554
Oh, poor baby. They'll be back tomorrow.

03:21.589 --> 03:23.424
How's she doing?

03:24.458 --> 03:27.427
Uh, she's doing... she's
doing all right, I think.

03:27.461 --> 03:31.364
Yeah, it's been good for
her being out in nature,

03:31.398 --> 03:35.468
you know, getting a little
time off, a little time away.

03:35.502 --> 03:39.172
We all have to be extra sweet
to her when she gets back.

03:39.206 --> 03:42.075
Losing a baby, is...

03:42.109 --> 03:45.078
... it's one of the hardest things
you can possibly go through.

03:47.081 --> 03:50.016
All right, I gotta go.

03:50.050 --> 03:53.119
Oh, hey, B, will you drop this
off at your dad's on your way out?

03:53.153 --> 03:54.220
Um... can't you?

03:54.255 --> 03:56.055
Yes I can but I asked you to.

03:56.090 --> 03:59.025
Thank you. All right, my
babies, I'll see you later.

03:59.059 --> 04:00.727
All right.

04:00.761 --> 04:02.695
How's your dad doing, after the breakup?

04:02.730 --> 04:06.666
It's so weird. Didn't Dani
just move in? What happened?

04:06.700 --> 04:09.702
Um, I dunno. He's fine.

04:10.871 --> 04:12.805
It's none of our business.

04:17.444 --> 04:18.378
[knocking]

04:20.380 --> 04:21.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:21.615 --> 04:24.450
Sorry I shoulda called. Mom asked me to...

04:24.485 --> 04:27.453
- Oh, thanks.
- No problem.

04:27.488 --> 04:31.524
I'd make you come in and have breakfast,
but I'm heading out in a minute.

04:33.560 --> 04:37.230
It's cool. I have stuff to do anyway.

04:37.264 --> 04:40.199
Ok. I'll see ya soon?

04:40.234 --> 04:42.402
Yeah, sure.

05:36.090 --> 05:38.191
[sighs] Sorry about that.

05:38.225 --> 05:41.894
I just... I'm not ready
to get into this, with him.

05:41.929 --> 05:46.199
No, don't worry about it. I wasn't
really ready to face him either.

05:46.233 --> 05:48.801
[sighs] Guess I can add
him to my amends list.

05:50.004 --> 05:51.104
He's already at the top of mine.

05:54.208 --> 05:55.808
Uh...

05:57.177 --> 06:00.747
You... wanna read the next part?

06:00.781 --> 06:02.081
Sure.

06:07.121 --> 06:10.690
"We have a list of all
persons we have harmed

06:10.724 --> 06:12.725
and to whom we are willing to make amends.

06:12.760 --> 06:16.729
We made it when we took inventory.

06:16.764 --> 06:21.100
We subjected ourselves to
a drastic self-appraisal.

06:21.135 --> 06:25.838
Now we go out to our
fellows and repair the damage

06:25.873 --> 06:27.106
done in the past."

06:30.878 --> 06:34.047
So why all the secrecy? What
kind of music festival is this?

06:34.081 --> 06:35.879
Is it like a rave?

06:35.880 --> 06:38.777
An underground warehouse
death-metal battle of the bands?

06:39.019 --> 06:42.855
Yup. I'm totally bringing you
to 'The Seven Levels of Hell,

06:42.890 --> 06:46.059
a Sound Experience That
Will Explode Your Eardrums!'

06:47.961 --> 06:49.762
I'm kidding.

06:51.131 --> 06:53.733
Look.

06:53.767 --> 06:55.835
[traditional Latin music playing]

07:01.108 --> 07:03.109
[people chattering]

07:08.816 --> 07:09.849
Nice.

07:15.823 --> 07:19.959
So when did these panic attacks start?

07:19.993 --> 07:22.695
Well, I've been seeing
Wyatt for a while now.

07:22.729 --> 07:24.163
Uh-huh.

07:24.198 --> 07:28.000
And we decided we wanted to have sex.

07:28.035 --> 07:32.839
Ok. Is that something you
feel like you're ready for?

07:32.873 --> 07:34.807
With Wyatt, I mean?

07:34.892 --> 07:37.059
I do. I did, anyway.

07:37.094 --> 07:41.030
But when we tried, I freaked out.

07:41.064 --> 07:45.101
I couldn't breathe and
I pushed him off of me.

07:45.135 --> 07:49.038
It's been happening a
few times a week since.

07:51.141 --> 07:55.111
I even thought I saw Liam
the other day, at work.

07:55.145 --> 07:57.914
I think...

07:57.948 --> 08:00.650
Do you think it's him, Liam?

08:00.684 --> 08:03.986
You mean, do I think the rape is
the cause of the panic attacks?

08:04.021 --> 08:05.755
Maybe.

08:05.789 --> 08:10.693
But things like that generally start
closer to the time of the event.

08:10.727 --> 08:13.529
- Do you trust Wyatt?
- Yeah, completely.

08:14.731 --> 08:17.333
But you also thought you
could trust Liam, right?

08:17.367 --> 08:22.205
And you were wrong. So how can
you trust your own judgment?

08:23.473 --> 08:25.308
You think I can't trust my judgment?

08:25.342 --> 08:28.077
No. I think you think you can't.

08:28.111 --> 08:32.982
Especially when it comes to making
yourself so vulnerable to another person.

08:33.015 --> 08:36.184
I think if you trusted yourself.

08:37.386 --> 08:39.155
I wouldn't have panicked with Wyatt.

08:39.188 --> 08:41.924
I think it's a possibility.

08:46.029 --> 08:47.997
So, what am I supposed to do?

08:49.933 --> 08:53.569
Did you see any signs

08:53.604 --> 08:56.472
that Liam wasn't who he pretended to be?

08:59.810 --> 09:01.844
Um, I guess, yeah.

09:03.647 --> 09:07.516
People show us who they
are, what they're capable of,

09:07.551 --> 09:11.287
If we're paying attention,
listening to our gut,

09:11.321 --> 09:14.323
that's how we learn to trust ourselves,

09:14.358 --> 09:17.193
by trusting we will act on our instincts

09:17.227 --> 09:19.428
to keep ourselves safe.

09:19.463 --> 09:22.365
You say you trust Wyatt completely

09:22.399 --> 09:25.368
so trust your instincts.

09:25.402 --> 09:27.203
Until he gives you a reason not to.

09:36.540 --> 09:37.941
- Hey!
- Sorry! We're almost there.

09:37.975 --> 09:40.476
Where are you taking me?

09:40.511 --> 09:43.546
I'm not telling you. That's
kinda the point of the blindfold.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.647
Fine.

09:56.527 --> 09:59.329
[hip hop music playing]

10:04.134 --> 10:06.302
What is this?

10:06.337 --> 10:09.305
This is where we, you know, the first time.

10:09.340 --> 10:12.275
It'll be like our first
date all over again.

10:12.309 --> 10:15.211
You mean our first hookup?

10:15.245 --> 10:19.082
By the way, we haven't
even had a real first date.

10:19.116 --> 10:20.490
Is this all you think I am?

10:20.491 --> 10:23.130
Some girl to get naked with in your garage?

10:23.133 --> 10:26.222
No! No. This is romantic.
Look flower petals.

10:26.256 --> 10:29.025
I... picked these myself.

10:29.059 --> 10:30.059
So this is it, huh?

10:30.094 --> 10:32.862
Your plan for our big "special date?"

10:34.031 --> 10:35.965
Sex on a nasty old couch?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.702
No! No, this is, um, this is just part one.

10:39.737 --> 10:42.605
I just wanted to spend some time
alone together 'cause no one's home.

10:42.639 --> 10:43.706
Then I was gonna take you out.

10:43.741 --> 10:44.741
Where?

10:44.775 --> 10:46.776
- [Stef] Hello?
- Um...

10:46.810 --> 10:49.612
Oh, God. Just wait.

10:49.646 --> 10:51.714
[Stef] Hello?

10:56.687 --> 10:59.355
Hi, Hayley. How are ya?

10:59.390 --> 11:00.356
Hi.

11:00.391 --> 11:02.225
Hi.

11:02.259 --> 11:04.293
Mom, I thought you were supposed
to be working that funeral?

11:04.328 --> 11:05.858
I can see that that's what you thought.

11:05.859 --> 11:07.484
But, well, they had to cancel.

11:08.032 --> 11:10.366
Someone forgot to dig the grave. [Chuckles]

11:10.401 --> 11:14.103
- So... what's up?
- Just hanging out.

11:14.138 --> 11:15.314
Uh-huh, well, you know the rules:

11:15.315 --> 11:17.133
no hanging out with
girls behind closed doors.

11:17.174 --> 11:18.207
That's not fair. What if I was gay?

11:19.810 --> 11:21.978
- Are you? Gay?
- No, but...

11:22.012 --> 11:24.881
Point taken. Then I guess
there's no hanging out with anyone

11:24.915 --> 11:27.717
behind closed doors, that
includes garage doors too.

11:27.751 --> 11:28.918
All right, we were on our way out, anyway.

11:28.952 --> 11:31.020
I see. And what about that big
paper that you had to work on?

11:31.055 --> 11:33.790
I'll finish it tonight. You ready?

11:40.898 --> 11:43.366
I'll just finish blowing
out these candles for you,

11:43.400 --> 11:45.735
bit of a fire hazard there, Jesus.

11:51.608 --> 11:54.310
- Hey.
- Hey, yo.

11:59.183 --> 12:01.117
- Hey.
- Sorry to crash.

12:01.151 --> 12:03.286
No worries. The more, the merrier.

12:03.353 --> 12:07.056
Well, thank you. Um, I'm
glad you say that, actually.

12:09.059 --> 12:12.895
Hey. Good to see ya.

12:12.930 --> 12:15.031
- You know Lou, right?
- Yeah we met at your party.

12:16.934 --> 12:20.803
So what is this? Some kinda
Mexican street festival? Seems cool.

12:20.838 --> 12:22.524
Yeah, there's a main stage over there

12:22.525 --> 12:24.169
and they usually play
some pretty great music.

12:24.975 --> 12:26.742
Nice.

12:26.777 --> 12:29.679
Cool. Well, um, why don't we
meet up with you there later?

12:29.713 --> 12:33.716
- Wyatt and I are gonna have a chow-down.
- We are?

12:33.750 --> 12:36.619
Mm-hmm, yeah, we're both gonna
eat one item from every food stall,

12:36.653 --> 12:38.788
and the first person to say
"uncle," has to pay for it all.

12:38.822 --> 12:41.524
Wait, so you think you're gonna out eat me?

12:41.558 --> 12:43.459
No, I know I'm gonna out-eat you.

12:43.494 --> 12:44.827
Ok, it's on, girl.

12:44.862 --> 12:49.332
How about we start with a little
spicy corn, to line the stomach?

12:49.366 --> 12:52.368
Yeah, how about it? Let's do it.

12:52.402 --> 12:54.504
- We're not doing that, right?
- No.

12:54.538 --> 12:57.507
- Ok, all right, cool. Let's go this way.
- All right.

12:59.543 --> 13:02.278
My grandfather used to
bring me here every year.

13:02.312 --> 13:05.414
He's a musician. He loves Latin music.

13:07.251 --> 13:10.319
- You like her?
- Who?

13:10.354 --> 13:12.188
Frida Kahlo.

13:12.222 --> 13:14.023
Um...

13:14.057 --> 13:17.927
I dunno. I mean, she could
stand to tweeze a little.

13:17.961 --> 13:21.230
Wait, you've never heard of Frida Kahlo?

13:21.265 --> 13:23.799
No. Why? Because I'm a Mexican?

13:23.800 --> 13:27.434
No, because she's... like a cultural icon.

13:27.454 --> 13:29.839
Yeah, a Mexican cultural icon.

13:29.873 --> 13:32.942
Yeah, but no, she's kind of international?

13:32.976 --> 13:36.012
Well I didn't really grow
up in a Latino home, so...

13:36.046 --> 13:38.014
No, that's not what I meant.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.950
Is something wrong?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.787
No.

13:53.564 --> 13:55.364
Wyatt?

13:57.734 --> 13:59.402
Wyatt?

14:02.472 --> 14:03.673
Hey.

14:07.511 --> 14:10.179
- You ok?
- Yeah.

14:11.582 --> 14:13.349
Not exactly, no.

14:13.383 --> 14:17.119
Ok, well, why not?

14:18.455 --> 14:21.457
Um, I've been having these panic attacks,

14:21.491 --> 14:23.259
ever since we tried to...

14:25.996 --> 14:26.963
Really?

14:26.997 --> 14:29.165
It's not your fault at all.

14:29.199 --> 14:31.968
Um... I'm just trying to...

14:32.002 --> 14:36.172
I'm supposed to practice trusting myself.

14:36.206 --> 14:39.909
I know that sounds dumb but it's
actually harder than you think.

14:39.943 --> 14:41.143
Oh.

14:44.047 --> 14:46.204
Anyway, I didn't really
wanna come here today

14:46.205 --> 14:48.319
'cause the crowds and everything.

14:49.953 --> 14:52.622
But I know that one of the
things I can trust is you, so...

14:54.591 --> 14:56.492
I'm right here.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.565
I was just getting these.

15:02.599 --> 15:04.533
- For you, my lady.
- [chuckles]

15:04.568 --> 15:06.335
Nerd.

15:06.370 --> 15:08.437
Unless you're full?

15:08.472 --> 15:10.234
I mean, we can stop, anytime you want.

15:10.235 --> 15:11.435
All you've gotta do is say the word.

15:11.441 --> 15:13.576
- No, No, I'm starving.
- You're starving, huh?

15:13.610 --> 15:16.379
- Mm-hm.
- You'll definitely enjoy this meatball then.

15:16.413 --> 15:19.215
- Yeah, cheers. Mm-hm.
- Cheers.

15:20.284 --> 15:22.451
Mmmm. Delicious.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.519
Right?

15:23.553 --> 15:27.089
Tamale? Unless you've had enough.

15:27.124 --> 15:29.325
Baby, we are just getting started.

15:31.428 --> 15:33.429
- Mmm.
- Mm-hm.

15:38.268 --> 15:40.069
I'm really glad you called.

15:40.103 --> 15:42.071
Me, too.

15:50.113 --> 15:53.916
Hey, Liam. I'm hungry, man. Let's go.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.419
<i>[Lena] I'm so glad you're
getting the day off, you deserve it.</i>

16:00.131 --> 16:03.099
<i>It'll be good for you, a
little quiet time to yourself.</i>

16:03.134 --> 16:05.469
[chuckles] Not really sure
what I'm gonna do with myself.

16:05.537 --> 16:09.740
<i>You don't have to do
anything. Why not just... be?</i>

16:09.774 --> 16:13.510
<i>- [chuckles]
- I'm serious.</i>

16:13.545 --> 16:15.579
<i>That's what's been so
great about this trip.</i>

16:15.613 --> 16:18.715
<i>All this time out in the
woods has really let me</i>

16:18.750 --> 16:21.518
<i>connect, you know, with... this.</i>

16:23.555 --> 16:26.356
Ok, Earth Mother. I got it.

16:27.392 --> 16:28.425
<i>We're both grieving, honey.</i>

16:28.460 --> 16:31.462
Yeah. [Clears throat] I know. I'm ok.

16:31.496 --> 16:34.198
<i>Ok. Maybe you could,</i>

16:34.232 --> 16:36.166
<i>I dunno, meditate or something?</i>

16:36.201 --> 16:38.068
[laughs]

16:38.103 --> 16:39.403
<i>I mean it.</i>

16:39.437 --> 16:41.238
I know you do. That's what scares me.

16:41.272 --> 16:43.841
I will try it, sweetheart.
Thank you. I love you.

16:43.875 --> 16:45.809
<i>I love you, too.</i>

16:54.018 --> 16:55.986
[exhales deeply]

17:03.695 --> 17:05.628
[sighs]

17:07.531 --> 17:09.733
[water dripping]

17:35.095 --> 17:38.625
_

17:39.330 --> 17:42.332
Oh, my God, this is so cool!

17:42.367 --> 17:44.101
How did you know about this?

17:44.135 --> 17:46.336
I told you, I wanted to do
something that's really special,

17:46.371 --> 17:48.603
so I did a bunch of research
on all the cool events

17:48.604 --> 17:49.294
that were happening this weekend.

17:49.340 --> 17:53.911
I'm sorry I doubted
you. I'm very impressed.

17:53.945 --> 17:58.148
- And hungry.
- Yeah? Let's go get you a taco.

17:58.183 --> 18:02.953
You know what? I read the best
tacos are actually over here.

18:02.987 --> 18:04.188
Wow you did do your research.

18:05.790 --> 18:07.057
Thank you.

18:07.091 --> 18:09.927
[traditional Latin music]

18:13.998 --> 18:15.732
You like this?

18:15.767 --> 18:19.770
Hear that rhythm line? It's so intricate.

18:19.804 --> 18:21.872
What's that?

18:21.906 --> 18:24.641
- It's a Guitarrán. Yeah.
- A Guitarrán.

18:24.676 --> 18:26.843
It's like a bass. But so much more.

18:26.878 --> 18:28.545
It's totally the backbone of the band.

18:30.682 --> 18:32.516
What?

18:32.550 --> 18:35.552
Nothing. I just didn't realize you were
into all these different kinds of music.

18:36.788 --> 18:38.388
You're full of surprises.

18:39.824 --> 18:41.658
There's more where that came from.

18:49.267 --> 18:54.137
And of course Jesus and sweet Mariana.

18:54.172 --> 18:58.408
"Taking money from her to buy drugs was
probably the worst thing I ever did."

19:01.246 --> 19:04.014
I mean, how am I supposed
to make amends to those two?

19:05.350 --> 19:08.285
What'd your sponsor say?
"Staying sober's a good start."

19:11.289 --> 19:14.057
But I get it. I feel the
same way about Brandon.

19:14.092 --> 19:16.159
Yeah, you didn't abandon your son.

19:16.194 --> 19:20.998
No. Not literally.

19:21.032 --> 19:24.701
But I did it in all kinds of other ways.
I mean, the relationship with Dani...

19:24.736 --> 19:28.639
I shoulda never started that
so soon after I got sober.

19:28.673 --> 19:30.907
I had Brandon living here with me.

19:30.942 --> 19:33.644
I shoulda made him a
priority, instead of...

19:35.647 --> 19:37.547
And it goes all the way back.

19:38.850 --> 19:41.685
After the divorce, I
shoulda fought for custody.

19:41.719 --> 19:45.389
Or at least partial custody.

19:45.423 --> 19:48.425
But the truth is, I didn't
think I could handle it.

19:50.461 --> 19:54.231
And it's a lot harder to drink all the
time with a little kid running around.

19:55.333 --> 19:58.235
I managed. With two of 'em.

19:58.269 --> 20:01.371
To drink, use coke, use crystal,

20:01.406 --> 20:03.540
some heroin.

20:03.574 --> 20:05.442
[scoffs]

20:05.476 --> 20:07.748
It doesn't even matter Stef and Lena

20:07.749 --> 20:09.066
are never gonna let me see them again.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.281
They made that perfectly clear.

20:11.316 --> 20:13.283
It's too bad.

20:13.318 --> 20:15.352
I think it's a mistake, not just for you.

20:19.357 --> 20:20.957
What would you say to them?

20:20.992 --> 20:24.194
I mean, if you could?

20:29.033 --> 20:30.200
Um...

20:40.611 --> 20:41.945
This is really hard.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.252
You know what? We did a lot of work today.

20:47.253 --> 20:49.745
You... wanna take a break?

20:50.388 --> 20:51.722
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:51.756 --> 20:53.457
Ok.

20:55.526 --> 20:56.593
[traditional Latin music continues]

20:56.627 --> 20:59.463
Best in town. Well, that's
what they say, anyway.

20:59.497 --> 21:00.464
Thanks.

21:13.144 --> 21:14.344
Callie?

21:17.115 --> 21:20.050
- What're you doing here?
- Oh, we tagged along with Brandon and Lou.

21:20.084 --> 21:21.485
They're here, too? Where are they?

21:21.519 --> 21:24.187
Oh, I don't know we split up
with them a little while ago.

21:24.222 --> 21:25.355
We're gonna meet them later
though for the concert.

21:25.390 --> 21:27.391
Oh yay! We'll join you.

21:29.160 --> 21:31.061
Hey, you know what I think we need?

21:31.095 --> 21:35.265
I think we need some dulce
de leche, something sweet.

21:35.299 --> 21:37.100
Yeah, no, I think that's
exactly what we need

21:37.135 --> 21:40.103
- Hey, but no puking! Puking's against the rules!
- Mm-hmm.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.909
[groans]

21:52.817 --> 21:55.752
I don't wanna be one to toot my own horn.

21:55.787 --> 21:57.587
Generally, I prefer you to do that.

21:57.622 --> 22:00.824
But since you're not here,
I guess I'm going to have

22:00.858 --> 22:04.428
to indulge in a little
self-congratulation.

22:06.664 --> 22:07.731
Check out that pipe!

22:07.765 --> 22:10.700
Look at that! No more leaky pipe!

22:10.735 --> 22:13.570
No more emptying the bowl
into the toilet anymore.

22:13.604 --> 22:15.705
How hot is that pipe,
huh? How hot is that pipe?

22:15.740 --> 22:20.644
And how hot is your mama, huh?

22:20.678 --> 22:23.580
In her hot tool belt? In her hot tool belt?

22:23.614 --> 22:28.218
Using power tools, oh, yeah, fixing things.

22:28.252 --> 22:31.221
Look at that pipe. Look at that pipe.

22:32.323 --> 22:34.090
[water trickling]

22:36.194 --> 22:37.260
Oh, crap!

22:39.197 --> 22:40.897
Oh, crap!

22:40.932 --> 22:43.867
[traditional Latin music continues]

23:03.374 --> 23:05.752
Wow. That's intense.

23:07.377 --> 23:10.112
- You should get one.
- [chuckles]

23:10.146 --> 23:13.515
One: I'm not 18 and two:
I'd like to live to be 18,

23:13.550 --> 23:18.120
which I don't think would happen if
my moms found out I got one of those.

23:18.154 --> 23:21.323
You don't have to be 18, for the
record, not at a place like this.

23:21.357 --> 23:23.258
Really?

23:27.063 --> 23:29.331
Nice. What is it?

23:29.365 --> 23:33.869
It's a Triple Spiral. It's the
Wiccan symbol of feminine power.

23:33.903 --> 23:36.872
I've got another one, but I
can't really show it to you here.

23:39.809 --> 23:43.011
Uh, what time does stuff
start on the main stage?

23:44.881 --> 23:47.950
So you're not into me?
Is that what's happening?

23:47.984 --> 23:50.919
Because it's either that or
you're completely oblivious,

23:50.954 --> 23:53.589
- and I'm pretty sure you're not that stupid.
- No, I...

23:53.623 --> 23:56.492
I mean, I basically just
offered to let you see me naked.

23:56.526 --> 24:00.529
I'm not oblivious, ok, and
I'm not stupid. I'm just...

24:00.563 --> 24:02.364
You're not over Callie? Not into me?

24:02.398 --> 24:03.565
- No.
- Then what?

24:03.600 --> 24:05.667
- Hey, Brandon, Liam's here.
- What?

24:05.702 --> 24:08.437
- Liam's here!
- What... ? Hang on, Wyatt?

24:08.471 --> 24:10.405
- I gotta go.
- Who's Liam?

24:10.440 --> 24:12.608
He's this guy who... I'll
tell you later, all right?

24:16.246 --> 24:18.580
Wyatt? Hey, slow down. What are you doing?

24:18.615 --> 24:20.582
I saw him over there. I lost him.

24:20.617 --> 24:22.217
You were following him?

24:22.252 --> 24:24.520
Yeah. I don't want Callie to see him.

24:24.554 --> 24:26.255
Then let's grab Callie and get outta here.

24:26.289 --> 24:28.190
No why should Callie be
the one who has to leave?

24:28.224 --> 24:31.293
Hey, dude, think about this.
This is not a good idea.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.167
Hey, the concert's about to
start, do you think we could...

24:38.201 --> 24:41.770
You guys go ahead, yeah, I'm sure
Wyatt's just gonna be a second.

24:41.804 --> 24:44.706
I'll meet you there. Save us a seat though.

24:44.741 --> 24:45.841
Ok. Hurry.

24:45.875 --> 24:49.745
Uh, can we stop by the
ladies room on our way?

25:02.692 --> 25:05.494
Excuse me.

25:05.528 --> 25:06.762
- Pardon me.
- Sorry. Excuse me.

25:11.634 --> 25:13.435
Whoa! What are you guys doing here?

25:13.469 --> 25:14.213
I told you I was coming here this morning.

25:14.214 --> 25:15.697
Never mind. Damn it. I gotta go.

25:16.773 --> 25:19.641
So you did a bunch of research, huh?

25:19.676 --> 25:21.560
Was that just stealing your brother's idea,

25:21.561 --> 25:22.835
or was there more to it than that?

25:25.615 --> 25:27.683
So really you just
wanted to use me? For sex?

25:27.717 --> 25:32.487
No. No. That's not it at all.
I like you. I really like you.

25:32.522 --> 25:37.025
You know, there are plenty of guys out
there that would treat me like this.

25:37.060 --> 25:39.261
- I thought you were different.
- I am, I really am different.

25:39.295 --> 25:42.130
I mean it. What do I have
to do to prove it to you?

25:44.067 --> 25:48.070
<i>[man] So you wanna make sure it's
in there as close as you can get it.</i>

25:48.104 --> 25:50.038
<i>And give it a whack.</i>

25:50.073 --> 25:53.041
<i>I shouldn't say "whack".</i>

25:53.076 --> 25:55.911
<i>I mean, tap it, very gently.</i>

26:04.687 --> 26:06.955
Well, look who's here? Hey, Mike!

26:06.990 --> 26:09.091
Hey.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.059
Ana and I...

26:11.061 --> 26:13.729
We're working the program together.

26:13.763 --> 26:17.733
I got 60 days, 60 days clean.

26:19.736 --> 26:23.438
I wrote Stef and Lena. I wrote your moms.

26:23.473 --> 26:27.376
I told them I wanted to see you, and Jesus

26:27.410 --> 26:29.511
just to tell you how sorry I am.

26:30.813 --> 26:33.615
I can't. I don't wanna...
I can't do this...

26:33.650 --> 26:36.418
Whoa whoa, let's just go
somewhere and talk, ok?

26:36.452 --> 26:39.288
Why? So she can lie to me again?

26:40.290 --> 26:41.490
No. No.

26:43.259 --> 26:46.094
Hey, Mariana!

26:47.230 --> 26:50.198
Mariana? Hey! Hey!

26:50.233 --> 26:52.968
What's going on? Are you ok?

26:53.002 --> 26:56.138
No, I'm not. Why did you bring me here?

26:56.172 --> 26:58.106
Is it because I'm not Latin enough?

26:58.141 --> 26:59.941
Is it because I dyed my hair? Why?

26:59.976 --> 27:02.287
No, I brought you here because I love it.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.971
I wanted to share it with you.

27:04.314 --> 27:05.592
Oh, because I'm Mexican?

27:05.593 --> 27:07.609
If I were Korean, would
you take me to Koreatown?

27:07.817 --> 27:10.018
If I wanted good barbecue, yeah.

27:10.053 --> 27:13.989
Ok, I don't get it, are you offended

27:14.023 --> 27:16.758
that I brought you to a festival
that actually celebrates yr culture?

27:16.793 --> 27:19.795
I mean, it's not like I made you
wear a sombrero and do tequila shots.

27:19.829 --> 27:22.064
Well, I'm sorry, this isn't my culture.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.900
Didn't you show me a
picture of your Quinceanera?

27:24.934 --> 27:26.868
That was just a party.

27:26.903 --> 27:28.904
Look, I grew up with Stef and Lena.

27:28.938 --> 27:32.541
I didn't eat churros, or dance flamenco...

27:32.575 --> 27:33.675
Flamenco's not Mexican.

27:33.710 --> 27:37.346
Don't do that! See? This is what I mean!

27:37.380 --> 27:40.482
This isn't me. I don't have
any connection to any of this!

27:40.516 --> 27:43.685
- I don't feel anything!
- Well, you clearly feel something.

27:43.720 --> 27:45.525
Why are you yelling at me?

27:45.526 --> 27:47.112
Is this about that woman? Who was that?

28:12.861 --> 28:15.196
Hey, Liam? Hey, you need
to get the hell outta here.

28:15.230 --> 28:18.766
Callie is here. I don't
want her seeing you.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.835
So for once in your life, do the right
thing and get the hell outta here.

28:21.870 --> 28:24.071
- Why don't you get out?
- Man, haven't you put her through enough?

28:24.105 --> 28:26.974
What about what she put me through? Huh?

28:27.008 --> 28:29.677
- What are you talking about?
- Accusing me like she did,

28:29.711 --> 28:31.879
dragging me into court, in front of my
parents and the whole freaking world.

28:31.913 --> 28:34.548
So what, you're saying you didn't rape her?

28:34.583 --> 28:36.450
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

28:36.484 --> 28:40.387
I had sex with her, but
trust me, she wanted it.

28:45.427 --> 28:48.295
Hey! Hey! Wyatt, stop! Stop!

28:54.636 --> 28:56.370
Come on! Hey, break it up!

28:56.404 --> 28:57.538
Hey, that's enough!

29:01.476 --> 29:02.543
Want me to call the cops?

29:09.084 --> 29:10.150
No.

29:11.319 --> 29:15.055
Ok, folks, move on.

29:15.090 --> 29:16.323
Show's over.

29:22.330 --> 29:25.165
Well, that was something.

29:26.935 --> 29:28.202
That guy, he, um...

29:28.236 --> 29:30.804
... did some bad stuff to Callie.

29:30.839 --> 29:32.806
And you just had to jump in to defend her.

29:34.976 --> 29:37.978
I'm kidding. I'm sure you had your reasons.

29:40.882 --> 29:42.850
You're pretty rock-n-roll, Foster.

29:42.884 --> 29:47.054
I mean, you're an idiot, but... come on.

29:49.958 --> 29:52.559
I'm sorry.

29:52.594 --> 29:56.664
I'm just kind of in a bad
place right now. I can't.

29:58.967 --> 30:01.835
It's not you, ok?

30:01.870 --> 30:04.805
And it's not Callie.

30:07.475 --> 30:08.642
It's me.

30:09.611 --> 30:12.646
I promise. I'm sorry.

30:17.319 --> 30:18.352
Let's get outta here.

30:22.724 --> 30:25.359
Callie! Hey!

30:27.562 --> 30:29.163
What? What did I do?

30:29.197 --> 30:31.231
I was just trying to protect you.

30:31.266 --> 30:33.500
- I know.
- Then what did I do wrong?

30:33.535 --> 30:36.236
That's not the kind of
protection I want, Wyatt.

30:36.271 --> 30:39.006
I told you, ok? I needed you today.

30:39.040 --> 30:42.142
I needed you. To be with me.

30:44.412 --> 30:47.181
I told myself that I could trust
you but I guess I was wrong.

30:47.215 --> 30:48.765
You know how I feel about violence,

30:48.766 --> 30:50.634
or do you not remember me screaming at you

30:50.649 --> 30:53.287
the last time that you
picked a fight with Liam.

30:53.321 --> 30:55.989
I can't believe we're
having this fight again.

30:58.259 --> 31:00.160
I was...

31:00.195 --> 31:02.963
I was just trying to
take care of you, Callie.

31:07.769 --> 31:09.703
Well, maybe you don't know how to do that.

Ok, thank you.

32:50.605 --> 32:51.872
Hey, are you ok?

32:55.577 --> 32:57.478
I miss the baby.

32:59.881 --> 33:02.850
We didn't even know her
and I miss her so much.

Hey.

33:41.216 --> 33:42.883
What the hell happened?

33:44.920 --> 33:47.121
- That hurts.
- [Mike] It's supposed to hurt.

33:47.155 --> 33:50.091
What are you doin', getting in fights,
anyway? Your hand just got better...

33:50.125 --> 33:53.794
I know, I know. I was
trying to stop it, honest.

33:53.829 --> 33:55.863
But...

33:55.897 --> 33:58.032
... once I saw Liam, I got so mad, I...

33:59.000 --> 34:00.034
I couldn't.

34:01.770 --> 34:05.639
Who you really mad at, B? Liam?

34:07.008 --> 34:08.609
Sure, maybe.

34:08.643 --> 34:11.745
He deserves some anger, but I gotta say,

34:11.780 --> 34:13.781
I don't think that's
really what this was about.

34:17.652 --> 34:18.853
I think you're mad at me.

34:21.723 --> 34:23.824
and I think you're mad at yourself.

34:26.527 --> 34:29.463
I want you to forgive yourself
for what happened with Dani.

34:31.333 --> 34:34.668
And I want you to forgive me for bringing
her into our lives in the first place.

34:36.670 --> 34:38.539
I'm so sorry, Dad.

34:38.572 --> 34:40.341
I know you are.

34:40.375 --> 34:42.309
I'm sorry, too.

34:46.348 --> 34:50.417
You can't avoid hurting the people
you love. That's just what happens.

34:50.452 --> 34:53.521
That's... that's family.

34:53.554 --> 34:55.166
But I got a feeling we're
gonna be making amends

34:55.167 --> 34:56.953
to each other for the rest of our lives.

34:57.259 --> 34:59.326
The only thing that
matters is we keep doing it.

You all right, my love?

35:25.887 --> 35:27.955
And Wyatt, how is he?

35:31.092 --> 35:34.795
Um, a little bruised but he'll be fine.

35:38.833 --> 35:42.002
I get that he was just trying
to protect me, but another fight?

do anyone, you know?

You know, sometimes you do

let yourself fall apart.

know, seeing all of this,

my dad left when I was six?

Well, my mom always used to tell us

38:36.837 --> 38:39.872
it had nothing to do with us,
