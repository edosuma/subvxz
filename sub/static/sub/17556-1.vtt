01:06.600 --> 01:09.134
Nice.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.408
Aren't you only
supposed to do that
right after you're married?

01:16.410 --> 01:17.943
You're, like,
a year late.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.578
Yeah, better safe
than sorry,
though, right?

01:19.580 --> 01:21.747
If I tripped on the way in,
it'd probably bring
bad luck.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.682
Wait, is that why
people do that?
Yeah.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.651
- You should read less.
-     Thanks.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.653
Excuse me.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.103
Does this, 
 like, go upstairs?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.375
Easy, easy, easy.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.415
We don't have
nearly enough stuff
to fill this place.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.217
Then we'll get 
 more stuff.

02:03.491 --> 02:04.923
This is going well.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.859
Oh, yeah,
it's going great.

02:08.395 --> 02:11.363
Hannah,
 your room's the last one
 on the right.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.435
Come on, Monty.
This is our new room.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.412
I don't blame you.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.571
So?

03:25.573 --> 03:29.975
Feels like I've gone
from house arrest
to solitary confinement.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.944
Come on,
look on the bright side.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.545
It's a lot bigger
than your old room.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.614
Yeah. Feels too big.

03:35.616 --> 03:37.616
Yeah, well, that's 'cause
you gotta picture your stuff

03:37.618 --> 03:39.484
thrown all over the place.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.423
Look at that.
Smaller already.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.793
I don't think
Monty likes it.

03:47.795 --> 03:50.295
Aw. Well, he will.
Takes time.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.777
You realize that
we're locked into
a 30-year mortgage, right?

04:05.779 --> 04:08.413
Yes, I am aware of
the mortgage.

04:08.415 --> 04:11.383
Just saying that
if we wanted to wait
till all our stuff's moved in

04:11.385 --> 04:12.851
before we start hanging
things on the wall,

04:12.853 --> 04:14.052
we totally could.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.654
I mean,
there's plenty of time.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.923
I just want it
to feel like home
as quickly as possible,

04:17.925 --> 04:20.125
especially for Hannah.
Mmm.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.763
You know, it's not
pictures and furniture
that make a home, Mel.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.498
It's the people
living in it.

04:28.002 --> 04:29.701
Besides, I know you're only
hanging up this stuff

04:29.703 --> 04:31.670
to get out of
actually carrying anything.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.372
Get away from me.

04:39.747 --> 04:42.014
I love you, Hannah.

04:51.759 --> 04:53.592
This is
the last of it.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.166
This goes
in the living room.
Oh, hey.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.101
Twenty bucks,
that thing ends
up in the trash.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.569
Okay, I hear you.

05:44.545 --> 05:45.944
Hannah?

05:46.714 --> 05:48.280
What do you think?

05:49.650 --> 05:52.651
I think it would look
better in the corner.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.553
That's what I thought,
but your dad thinks--

05:54.555 --> 05:57.756
He's as far away from
an interior designer
as you get.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.224
Help me push it back.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.494
There we go.

06:06.300 --> 06:08.166
Much better.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.502
Whoa! Careful.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.037
No.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.405
Sounds like
your distributor.

06:13.407 --> 06:14.740
What's that?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.042
Distributor.
It's probably just
a loose wire.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.978
Easy fix.
Well, I do like easy.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.181
Easy means cheap.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.517
Ray Walsh.
Hey. John Alexander.
Nice to meet you.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.719
So, you're
the new neighbor.
Yup.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.654
You mind?
Knock yourself out.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.825
So, you're a locksmith?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.727
In this economy?

06:35.729 --> 06:37.362
That, and then some.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.265
Why? You need something?

06:40.267 --> 06:43.034
No, just the realtor suggested
we rekey all the locks, so...

06:43.036 --> 06:45.504
There's something
about this neighborhood
we should know about?

06:45.506 --> 06:46.905
No, no, no.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.640
That's just common sense.

06:48.642 --> 06:51.843
Never know
who's running around
with access to your place.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.647
Say bye 
 to Hannah, Rachel.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.249
Bye, Hannah. 
 I'm gonna miss you.

06:57.251 --> 06:59.251
You're gonna miss her? 
 Good.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.319
What's up, bro?
 Hannah! 
 You have a good one!

07:01.321 --> 07:03.155
Miss you.
 Bye!

07:03.157 --> 07:05.023
Bye. 
 We're gonna miss you.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.096
We'll miss you 
 so much--

07:35.189 --> 07:37.022
Couldn't help yourself, huh?

07:37.024 --> 07:38.924
Sound of a bad engine's
like my Batsignal, Mel.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.892
Can't just ignore it.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.694
How's he seem? Nice?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.095
Yeah, nice enough.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.430
He's actually gonna rekey
our locks for us.

07:46.266 --> 07:47.599
Oh.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.335
First moving casualty, huh?
Loved that lamp.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.571
Aw, that's a shame.
I know.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.207
Hey, you got 20 bucks
on you?

07:55.542 --> 07:56.842
Huh?

07:56.844 --> 07:58.210
Let's roll!

08:04.485 --> 08:06.151
It's better right here,
I promise.

08:06.153 --> 08:07.953
You can't put it
in front of a vent.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.221
It... There's...

08:09.223 --> 08:11.156
Look, there's space
for ventilation to go--

08:11.158 --> 08:14.493
It's right
in front of it, though.
Okay, but we don't have to...

08:23.570 --> 08:25.470
Where are you, anyway?

08:25.472 --> 08:28.373
It's the only room
I could find
a wireless signal.

08:28.375 --> 08:31.476
I guess
it's gonna be the office.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.778
Until it becomes a nursery.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.647
Don't even joke about that.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.215
I wasn't joking.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.388
Wait, what?

08:43.390 --> 08:47.158
Are you sure you're not
freaking out or anything?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.560
About us? No.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.428
No, we'll be fine.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.563
But it's not like
 you're gonna find

08:51.565 --> 08:53.498
a new boyfriend in suburbia--

08:53.500 --> 08:54.432
Wait, wait.
Tommy, you're breaking up.
 And plus...

08:56.036 --> 08:57.836
Shit.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.451
First dinner
in the new house,
we gotta toast to that, right?

09:51.058 --> 09:53.058
Really, Mel?
I'm fine with water.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.328
No. See, you can't toast
with water.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.530
It's bad luck.
This isn't, like...

09:59.266 --> 10:01.066
A test, is it?

10:01.068 --> 10:03.668
It's not a test.
It's a toast.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.239
To us...

10:08.241 --> 10:09.507
To family...

10:09.943 --> 10:11.209
To home.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.616
Who were you
talking to upstairs?

10:17.618 --> 10:18.683
Tommy.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.252
How's he doing?

10:21.254 --> 10:23.154
I guess he's fine.

10:23.156 --> 10:24.990
You know,
I think a little distance
will be good for both of you.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.992
And I think
that you're wrong.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.127
And I think you better--
 What's 
 Becky up to this summer?

10:29.129 --> 10:32.797
Maybe after you've settled in,
she can come
visit for a few days.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.599
Look, 
 we know how hard this is.

10:34.601 --> 10:36.568
If there was
another way, we would--
There was another way.

10:36.570 --> 10:38.136
I could have stayed
with any of my friends.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.005
For the whole year?
Yes.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.740
It's my senior year, Mel.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.475
You really think
we're ready to
trust you again?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.643
John.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.712
You're right.
I'm sorry.

10:51.785 --> 10:53.251
Whatever.

10:59.393 --> 11:00.925
Leave that,
I'll take it to work.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.915
I love you, Hannah.

11:44.304 --> 11:45.837
Monty, it's okay.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.685
Easy, Monty.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.544
I think you should go
 a little easier on Hannah.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.113
Easier on her?

12:28.115 --> 12:29.514
She's a teenager, John.

12:29.516 --> 12:31.316
Yeah, she's a teenager
who threw a party

12:31.318 --> 12:32.884
that almost destroyed
our old house,

12:32.886 --> 12:35.086
who got arrested
for underage drinking.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.621
Oh, right.
Because you never drank

12:36.623 --> 12:38.990
or went to parties
as a teenager.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.525
Never got arrested.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.462
Oh.
What are you doing?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.331
I think you know
what I'm doing.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.701
Um, I'm not really
feeling this shirt.

12:49.703 --> 12:51.636
What? 
 This is my lucky shirt.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.325
Stop.

16:12.272 --> 16:13.972
Nice try, Dad.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.453
Monty?

17:02.455 --> 17:05.089
What are you doing
out there?

17:13.165 --> 17:16.034
Dad! 
 What's the code?
1-0-6-1-8!

17:18.137 --> 17:20.070
Are you all right?
Monty was outside.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.573
So I opened the door.
I don't know how he got there.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.876
That's probably
the alarm company.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.644
I'll get it.
You guys go back
to bed.

17:53.973 --> 17:55.540
Who ate
all the Chinese food?

17:55.542 --> 17:57.208
I thought you said you guys
were gonna leave me some.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.243
Oh, don't look at me.
Have you seen my keys?

17:59.245 --> 18:01.279
Little nervous
for your first day
at the library, huh?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.981
Books are books.
Ooh, have you seen my keys?

18:03.983 --> 18:05.716
Yes. Spare's by
the front door.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.952
Great. Thank you. Bye.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.822
Hey, don't forget,
Ray's coming over
for the locks.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.761
You're not the only one
that drinks milk,
you know.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.396
It's fine. We're family.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.700
Have you seen Monty?
Nope.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.135
He'll show up.
He's probably just getting

18:24.137 --> 18:26.504
acquainted with
the neighborhood.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.072
Hey, come with me
for a second.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.116
What?
Did you get me a new car?

18:39.519 --> 18:40.985
Not exactly.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.856
What is all this stuff?

18:44.858 --> 18:46.591
Previous owners walked away
from their mortgage,

18:46.593 --> 18:48.292
so we had to buy
the place as is.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.195
I guess this is what
they meant by "as is."

18:51.197 --> 18:54.265
Okay. But what does this
have to do with me?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.100
Well, since you're grounded
for the next two months,

18:56.102 --> 18:58.069
I thought I would give you
something to do.

18:58.071 --> 18:59.604
Tell you what,
so it's not all bad.

18:59.606 --> 19:01.672
You can keep anything in here
you think is valuable.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.741
Aw. Gee, thanks.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.743
Gotta go.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.714
Hey, think fast.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.762
Shit.

19:44.984 --> 19:46.450
That's the new neighbor.

19:46.452 --> 19:48.953
- Let's go say hi.
- She's staring.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.758
- Let's get out of here.
- Go, go. Go.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.398
So that just happened.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.506
Ms. Alexander?

20:42.508 --> 20:44.508
I didn't mean to scare you.
No, no, you didn't.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.311
I just...
I completely forgot
you were coming over.

20:47.313 --> 20:48.980
Well, you got a lot
on your plate.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.115
Tell you what,
don't mind me.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.984
I'll be out of your hair
in just a bit.

20:54.787 --> 20:58.256
Any juicy neighborhood gossip
we should know about, Ray?

21:00.860 --> 21:03.194
You know,
I couldn't tell you
if there was.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.398
Of course, I work all day,

21:07.400 --> 21:10.701
and my wife is pretty shy
when it comes to socializing.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.406
You know, I did wanna
mention these locks.

21:16.476 --> 21:19.010
Cheap and ineffective.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.511
Somebody who knows
what they're doing

21:20.513 --> 21:23.748
could break into your place
in less than a minute.

21:23.750 --> 21:27.084
You really should consider
 upgrading to the new ones.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.420
This whole rekeying...

21:29.422 --> 21:31.022
It really only serves
for homeowners

21:31.024 --> 21:32.890
to feel like
they're doing something.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.694
How much are new locks?

21:36.696 --> 21:39.930
What's the price
for your family safety,
Ms. Alexander?

21:43.836 --> 21:45.569
Couple of hundred bucks.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.572
If you're aiming for quality.

21:52.779 --> 21:54.178
Well...

21:54.881 --> 21:56.847
We'll look into that.

21:56.849 --> 22:00.651
But we do have
the alarm system.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.153
Oh, yeah.

22:02.755 --> 22:04.188
I saw that.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.293
It's a good one, too.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.530
At least it was 12 years ago.

22:34.854 --> 22:38.456
Hey, Mel,
have you seen
Monty anywhere?

22:38.458 --> 22:39.957
Who's Monty?

22:39.959 --> 22:41.425
Is that your boyfriend?

22:41.427 --> 22:42.593
He's my cat.

22:42.595 --> 22:45.096
What are you doing
 with my camera?

22:45.098 --> 22:49.367
I saw this on the table
and I could not resist.

22:49.369 --> 22:52.570
What's your name?
Hannah.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.938
Don't you wanna know mine?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.740
Not really.
Can you not...

22:55.742 --> 22:57.508
Whoa! Oh, oh!

22:57.510 --> 22:59.110
What are you doing?

22:59.112 --> 23:01.879
Well, I'm thinking about
getting me one of these.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.115
You know, when your mom
and I were younger,

23:04.117 --> 23:06.117
these things were,
like, heavy.

23:06.986 --> 23:09.286
Do you remember that?
No.

23:10.990 --> 23:14.191
Well, I am a little older.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.260
Do me a favor and tell
 Mr. Alexander

23:16.262 --> 23:19.130
not to worry about
any sort of payment
just yet.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.266
You all can owe me.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.168
Welcome to
the neighborhood.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.415
Oh, shit.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.281
Look, I'm telling you,
 it could've been
 one of the movers.

25:50.283 --> 25:52.082
But it not like
it's the first time

25:52.084 --> 25:54.018
that I've showered
since I've been here.

25:54.020 --> 25:55.719
I mean,
I would have seen it before.

25:55.721 --> 25:57.388
Then it was your dad,
or Melanie.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.290
I mean, who else could it be?
I don't know.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.158
That's sort of the point.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.394
Something's happening
in this house.

26:14.740 --> 26:15.873
What?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.178
Only two more months.
Only.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.347
All right.

26:25.117 --> 26:27.117
Oh!

26:27.119 --> 26:29.553
Are your parents home?
No.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.556
Oh, I see.

26:32.558 --> 26:35.259
Uh, let me guess.
This isn't your brother.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.628
That's disgusting.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.730
I should go. See ya.
Bye.

26:43.069 --> 26:44.935
Oh, here.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.871
I'm Rosemary Fletcher.
I live a couple of
doors down.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.774
Uh, Hannah. Hi.

26:50.776 --> 26:53.844
So, are you gonna go
to Springville next year?

26:53.846 --> 26:56.113
Yeah. I'll be a senior.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.216
Oh, a new school
your senior year?

26:59.218 --> 27:01.418
Same thing happened to me.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.454
Your parents aren't in
the military, are they?

27:03.456 --> 27:06.957
No. No. My dad was offered
a job at the airport.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.125
That's why we moved.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.628
He was out of work
for a while.

27:10.630 --> 27:12.663
Well, don't worry
about the new school.

27:12.665 --> 27:15.766
A week or two, and it'll
be just as unbearable
as the old one.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.371
Well, I won't
keep you. Um...

27:20.373 --> 27:22.506
Please give my best
to your parents.

27:22.508 --> 27:25.109
Yeah, I will.
It was nice meeting you.

27:25.111 --> 27:26.377
You, too.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.379
Bye.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.592
Excuse me?

28:50.129 --> 28:51.428
Hi.

28:53.099 --> 28:54.898
You here to help?

28:54.900 --> 28:55.999
No.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.337
Well, you might as well
get it over with.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.672
I have a question.

29:01.674 --> 29:04.975
It's not,
like, gross, is it?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.343
No.
Okay.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.512
Uh, well,
then go ahead and ask.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.748
- My friends want...
- Hurry. Ask her.

29:10.750 --> 29:12.716
They wanna know
what it's like living here.

29:14.086 --> 29:15.819
What do you mean?

29:15.821 --> 29:18.922
You know how
every neighborhood
has that one creepy house?

29:18.924 --> 29:20.958
Yeah.
Well...

29:20.960 --> 29:22.626
You're living in it.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.729
So, is it true?
Did people really die here?

29:25.731 --> 29:27.765
They were just trying
to get a rise out of you.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.400
See how you'd react.
That's it.
React to what?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.870
One of the kids
in the neighborhood
spooked Hannah.

29:32.872 --> 29:35.139
Really? How?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.241
They told me that the family
that lived here

29:37.243 --> 29:39.576
was murdered in the house.

29:40.513 --> 29:42.379
They said that?
Yeah.

29:42.381 --> 29:44.081
And I told her that
information like that

29:44.083 --> 29:46.016
had to be disclosed
to potential buyers,

29:46.018 --> 29:49.920
and the realtor
never mentioned anything,
so there's...

29:51.991 --> 29:53.524
Oh, my God...

29:58.197 --> 30:00.364
Look, it happened
years ago, okay?

30:00.366 --> 30:01.932
You're kidding, right?

30:01.934 --> 30:03.600
This isn't funny, Dad.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.503
I'm not trying
to be funny.
Unbelievable.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.139
Look, not telling
you guys was wrong.
I admit that, okay?

30:09.141 --> 30:11.441
But it's because
I didn't want you to get
those stupid thoughts

30:11.443 --> 30:12.543
stuck in your heads.

30:12.545 --> 30:14.044
This is a great house,

30:14.046 --> 30:15.979
in a great neighborhood
that we actually
could afford.

30:15.981 --> 30:18.515
And I just...
I wanted what was best
for both of you.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.685
So, what happened?
 I don't know.

30:21.687 --> 30:24.555
I don't know. Really, I don't.
Look, it happened
over 10 years ago.

30:24.557 --> 30:27.457
Two families have
lived here since then.

30:27.459 --> 30:28.826
You know, over in Europe,
they live in houses

30:28.828 --> 30:30.727
that are hundreds
of years old, right?

30:30.729 --> 30:32.396
I'm sure some pretty
bad stuff went down
in those too.

30:32.398 --> 30:33.997
You don't see
people running around--

30:33.999 --> 30:35.966
Well, what about the family
that lived here
right before us?

30:35.968 --> 30:38.235
They said that
they just disappeared.

30:38.237 --> 30:41.471
Hey, we were nearly
at that point
not so long ago, remember?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.373
It happens.
 People lose their jobs

30:43.375 --> 30:45.809
and walk away
from their mortgages
all the time.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.513
Hannah?

30:49.515 --> 30:52.683
Let her go, John. 
 Can you blame her?

30:52.685 --> 30:55.752
She just found out her dad
is kind of an asshole.

30:59.158 --> 31:02.659
Yeah, well, she's a teenager.
I'm pretty sure
she already thought that.

31:02.661 --> 31:05.696
Detectives have just released
 the names of a family

31:05.698 --> 31:08.432
killed in a murder-suicide
 earlier this week.

31:08.434 --> 31:11.068
Police found
 the mutilated bodies
 of Elizabeth Howe

31:11.070 --> 31:14.471
and her daughter, Rebecca,
 in their Springville home.

31:14.473 --> 31:18.208
Elizabeth was found
 stabbed to death
 in her daughter's bedroom.

31:18.210 --> 31:20.944
Downstairs, 17-year-old
 Rebecca had been butchered

31:20.946 --> 31:23.013
just feet
 from the front door.

31:23.015 --> 31:26.383
The suspect,
 husband and father,
 Robert Howe,

31:26.385 --> 31:28.485
was found
 hanging in the attic.

31:28.487 --> 31:32.155
Baffled neighbors
 claim they had never heard
 Robert and Elizabeth fight,

31:32.157 --> 31:34.958
and that
 the family seemed normal.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.761
Rebecca was a senior
 at Springville High School

31:37.763 --> 31:40.764
and was aspiring to
 be a photographer.

32:05.457 --> 32:06.857
Monty?

32:49.902 --> 32:51.101
Monty?

32:52.171 --> 32:53.837
Monty, come on.

32:56.942 --> 32:58.508
Monty?

32:58.510 --> 33:00.344
Monty, come here.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.746
Monty?

33:39.551 --> 33:40.951
Monty?

34:34.172 --> 34:37.007
Dad!

34:37.009 --> 34:37.974
Dad!

34:37.976 --> 34:40.143
I'm coming!
 Dad!

34:40.145 --> 34:41.777
Hold on!

34:41.780 --> 34:42.946
I got you,
I got you--

34:42.947 --> 34:44.481
There's someone
up there.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.849
What are you talking about?

34:45.851 --> 34:47.918
There is someone
up there.
John.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.518
I'll go check it out.

34:49.521 --> 34:52.289
Dad! No, please don't go!
It's okay.
It's okay.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.757
Just calm down.

35:06.004 --> 35:07.204
John!

35:10.042 --> 35:11.108
John?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.851
Dad.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.422
Did you see anybody?

35:27.192 --> 35:28.458
Dad?

35:28.460 --> 35:31.661
There's nobody up there.
But I saw someone.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.296
You saw what?

35:33.298 --> 35:34.664
I don't know.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.633
I could hear someone
breathing behind me.
Jesus.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.602
Honey, don't you
think this is a little--
A little what?

35:38.604 --> 35:40.270
I don't know.
Don't you think
it's a little convenient

35:40.272 --> 35:41.872
that she's doing
all this right after

35:41.874 --> 35:43.740
she finds out
what happened here?

35:43.742 --> 35:45.342
That's why I didn't
wanna say anything.

37:39.925 --> 37:41.925
Can I help you
inside with those?

37:41.927 --> 37:44.394
Oh, thanks, Hannah.
That'd be great.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.304
Your house is laid out
just like ours.

37:54.306 --> 37:56.339
The wonders of
tract housing.

37:59.478 --> 38:02.212
Did you know the family
that was killed in our house?

38:03.915 --> 38:06.349
Such
a pretty girl, wasn't she?

38:06.351 --> 38:08.918
How well did you
know them?

38:08.920 --> 38:12.222
Oh. Not at all, really.

38:12.224 --> 38:15.458
The dad seemed a bit strange,
but you would never think

38:15.460 --> 38:18.295
that he was capable
of something so terrible.

38:18.297 --> 38:21.898
The wife stayed at home.
 We'd wave, she'd wave.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.568
They kept to themselves,
and so did we.

38:25.570 --> 38:29.272
Which is why
it took her school
to discover what happened

38:29.274 --> 38:32.275
after the girl was absent
for a number of days.

38:33.512 --> 38:36.646
Taught us around here
 a hard lesson.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.549
You never really know
who your neighbors are.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.520
What about the family
that disappeared?

38:43.522 --> 38:47.157
The ones that lived there
right before us.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.627
They were, like, eight months
behind on their loan.

38:50.629 --> 38:54.130
The Kelly woman
down the street heard
it was a year and a half.

38:54.132 --> 38:56.933
So, you know.
Then I guess...

38:56.935 --> 39:00.470
You never heard
if they
experienced anything...

39:01.406 --> 39:03.440
Like it's haunted?

39:03.442 --> 39:05.709
Every kid
 in the neighborhood
 thinks that.

39:05.711 --> 39:09.612
I have never heard
anyone over 12
seriously talk about it,

39:09.614 --> 39:11.681
including anyone
who lived there.

39:11.683 --> 39:12.982
Oh.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.918
Okay.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.455
It's tough, moving.

39:19.524 --> 39:21.658
Fucks with your head.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.193
You know, 
 I think it's pretty cool.

39:23.195 --> 39:24.661
Then you can live here.

39:24.663 --> 39:26.863
Yeah. But over in Europe,
 the houses are old

39:26.865 --> 39:28.498
and have plenty
 of creepy history
 but people still live in it.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.734
No, don't.
Don't even say that.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.602
All right.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.505
Well, is now a bad time
 to ask if you got
 my message?

39:36.108 --> 39:37.440
What message?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.976
I left you a message
 on your camera.

39:40.579 --> 39:41.911
You did?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.185
It's not here.
 No, it's your camera?

39:49.187 --> 39:50.520
Like that's a big surprise.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.654
No, seriously.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.226
Uh, I should go.

39:56.228 --> 39:58.962
Hey, your camera will turn up.
 It always does.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.530
Okay. Okay.

40:05.137 --> 40:06.603
Everything all right?

40:06.605 --> 40:08.104
Uh...

40:08.106 --> 40:11.274
It's not great.
 Know what I think?

40:11.276 --> 40:13.877
I think you need to
get out of this house.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.645
Yeah. No kidding.

40:15.647 --> 40:19.416
I mean, more, like,
for the afternoon.

40:22.554 --> 40:26.189
I just want you to know
that you can talk
to me about things.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.158
Yeah, but what's the point?

40:28.160 --> 40:29.793
Neither of you believe me.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.995
About what? The house?
Yes.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.598
Stuff disappears or moves.

40:35.600 --> 40:40.670
Doors close and open,
and those weird noises...

40:40.672 --> 40:41.971
What weird noises?

40:41.973 --> 40:45.308
Like creaking and...
Whistling.

40:46.278 --> 40:48.211
So you've heard it too.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.681
That doesn't mean
the house is haunted.
Hannah--

40:51.683 --> 40:56.319
No, no, but something's
going on and it feels wrong.

40:56.321 --> 41:00.323
You don't feel it?

41:00.325 --> 41:02.225
I think there's an explanation
for everything.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.227
Oh, you sound
just like Dad.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.162
Hello?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.205
False alarm?

41:23.949 --> 41:26.449
Anything missing?
No.

41:26.451 --> 41:28.751
But that doesn't mean
Ray wasn't in here.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.820
Come on, Mel, you heard what
the security company said,

41:30.822 --> 41:33.056
they probably just need
to adjust the sensitivity
of the alarm--

41:33.058 --> 41:34.824
I don't trust him.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.026
He basically said he could
break into our house
to my face.

41:37.028 --> 41:40.129
Was that before or after
he tried to sell you
on the new locks?

41:40.131 --> 41:41.364
Well, it worked.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.299
I want new locks
and not from him.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.668
Well, it's a little more
expensive than just rekeying,
you know.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.137
We just got hit
with a ton of bills,
maybe in a couple of months--

41:48.139 --> 41:49.906
No! Now.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.475
What's the price
of your family's safety, John?

42:13.465 --> 42:15.598
Jesus, Ray.

42:17.502 --> 42:20.203
Is my work not good enough
for you, Mr. Alexander?

42:20.205 --> 42:22.939
My wife and daughter
are just a little
bit uncomfortable.

42:22.941 --> 42:25.542
Because of something I did?

42:25.544 --> 42:27.877
I don't know, Ray.
What did you do?

42:27.879 --> 42:29.646
Are you accusing me
of something?

42:31.283 --> 42:33.216
'Cause that would
not be a good idea.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.385
Is that a threat?
No.

42:36.187 --> 42:37.520
That's a warning.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.090
Take care, now.

42:41.092 --> 42:43.426
Yeah, you too.

42:51.436 --> 42:52.702
Asshole.

43:08.753 --> 43:11.588
Huh. How'd that get...

43:23.401 --> 43:27.470
Here we go. 
 You're upstairs.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.639
I just wanna be
 the first to go on record

43:29.641 --> 43:33.009
that I love you,
 Hannah Alexander.

43:33.011 --> 43:35.511
Please don't show this
 to any of my friends. Okay?
 Thanks. Bye.

43:38.650 --> 43:41.684
Who's Monty? 
 Is that your boyfriend?

43:42.787 --> 43:44.087
He's my cat.

43:44.089 --> 43:45.955
What are you doing
 with my camera?

43:45.957 --> 43:49.626
Well, I saw this
 on the table
 and I could not resist.

43:51.463 --> 43:53.630
This is where they eat.

44:19.324 --> 44:22.425
This is where they sleep.

44:47.952 --> 44:50.853
This is where she sleeps.

45:14.179 --> 45:15.645
Ray!

45:37.869 --> 45:40.470
So, the house is still listed
for sale by the bank.

45:40.472 --> 45:42.972
Cops are on their way
to check it out now.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.741
What does that mean?

45:44.743 --> 45:46.576
It means that
they were squatters.

45:47.746 --> 45:49.746
What did they say
about the video?

45:49.748 --> 45:52.348
They're gonna go over it,
see if they can prove
it was him.

45:53.785 --> 45:56.486
This guy was
in our house, John.

45:56.488 --> 45:58.354
While we slept.
 I know.

45:58.356 --> 46:00.890
You were right.
I'm sorry, honey.

46:00.892 --> 46:04.527
Things were
actually happening,
and I just didn't listen.

46:04.529 --> 46:06.362
I just wanted it to work.
 I want it to work.

46:06.364 --> 46:07.697
Look, I'm just glad
that we stopped it

46:07.699 --> 46:09.766
before it escalated
into anything worse.

46:11.302 --> 46:14.637
Are you sure it's over?
 Absolutely.

46:14.639 --> 46:17.540
We won't see Ray anymore.
Trust me.

46:21.946 --> 46:23.379
We should go.

46:25.483 --> 46:27.483
We will, darling.

46:29.521 --> 46:31.788
I just gotta
do something first.

46:47.639 --> 46:50.807
Hey. Sorry,
didn't mean to scare you.

46:51.442 --> 46:53.042
That's okay.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.281
You know, your mom
used to sleep-punch me.

46:58.283 --> 46:59.715
What?

46:59.717 --> 47:01.450
Sleep-punch?
Yeah.

47:01.452 --> 47:04.687
Anytime I'd try
and wake her up,
or startled her somehow,

47:04.689 --> 47:06.322
she'd start
flailing her arms around

47:06.324 --> 47:07.957
and smack me
right in the face.

47:07.959 --> 47:10.359
Funniest thing is,
she wouldn't even wake up.

47:11.129 --> 47:12.728
She packed quite a punch.

47:16.868 --> 47:18.000
Here.

47:20.238 --> 47:22.405
I thought I still had
two months left.

47:22.407 --> 47:24.607
Eh. Time off for
good behavior.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.587
Hey. I love you, kiddo.

47:38.289 --> 47:39.755
I love you, too.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.197
Hey, Han.
 Last-minute change.

48:26.471 --> 48:29.372
We're going to
 the club with my dad,
 and it's formal.

48:29.374 --> 48:30.873
No jeans.

48:31.376 --> 48:32.775
Great.

49:20.692 --> 49:23.225
Yeah.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.102
These'll do the job.

49:33.905 --> 49:35.037
Fun.

57:36.287 --> 57:39.221
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.

57:39.223 --> 57:40.589
Oh, my God
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

57:40.591 --> 57:42.524
Don't make this--
What are you doing here?

57:59.610 --> 58:01.043
Wait.

58:01.045 --> 58:03.078
Where did you park?

58:03.080 --> 58:05.347
Uh, down the street.

58:05.349 --> 58:07.683
And don't worry,
I'll even sneak out the back.

58:07.685 --> 58:09.117
Okay.

58:35.846 --> 58:38.514
She looks happy,
at least.

58:38.516 --> 58:41.517
- If she only knew, right?
- Yeah.

58:41.519 --> 58:44.520
I felt bad throwing it away.
Hmm.

58:45.523 --> 58:47.723
Look, she kinda looks
like you.

58:47.725 --> 58:49.091
No, she doesn't.

58:55.733 --> 58:57.533
Who is that?
Who?

58:58.769 --> 59:00.102
Him.

59:03.674 --> 59:05.941
Hannah, I'm home!
Oh, shit.

59:05.943 --> 59:07.376
Mmm... What should I do?

59:07.378 --> 59:09.411
He'd freak out if
he knew you were here.

59:09.413 --> 59:11.613
Yeah, uh... It's cool.

59:11.615 --> 59:13.582
I'll hide.

59:13.584 --> 59:14.983
The closet.

59:14.985 --> 59:17.986
No, no, Tommy.
Are you crazy?
No. Yeah, it's fine.

59:17.988 --> 59:20.489
You can't hide in my closet.
Come on.
They won't see me, I swear.

59:20.491 --> 59:23.225
I'm sorry, you have to go.
All right.

59:24.995 --> 59:26.428
I'll come back tomorrow.
Mmm-hmm.

59:26.430 --> 59:28.630
Hopefully my car
can take the drive.

59:30.668 --> 59:32.534
I'll stall him
while you sneak out.

59:35.506 --> 59:38.874
Hey, Dad, do you see
how clean the garage is?

59:38.876 --> 59:40.442
Let's take a look.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.418
Do you want 
 a sweater or something?

59:49.420 --> 59:51.920
No.
 So, we're actually
 doing this, huh?

59:51.922 --> 59:53.322
You guys look nice.

59:53.324 --> 59:55.157
Thank you.
You'll be okay?

59:55.159 --> 59:57.459
She'll be fine.
Plenty of leftovers
in the fridge.

59:57.461 --> 01:00:00.462
And I plan on
faking food poisoning
around 9:00,

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:02.698
so we won't be home
too late.

01:00:04.435 --> 01:00:06.234
Call if
you need anything.

01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:08.170
I'll be fine.
You guys have fun.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:10.138
Okay.
Bye.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.140
No Tommy.
Bye.

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:06.695
You hit him with them shoes.

01:01:06.697 --> 01:01:10.098
- Ain't I right, this time?
- You're silly.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:13.235
You think I'm silly
 'cause I said about
 the stick?

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.936
All I was trying
 was to make you say,

01:01:14.938 --> 01:01:16.738
"No, it wasn't no stick.
 It was my shoes."

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:19.074
- 'Cause I know what it was.
- You lie all the time.

01:01:19.076 --> 01:01:21.977
All the time.
 How come I got
 those shoes then?

01:01:23.781 --> 01:01:25.447
Where did you 
 get them?

01:01:25.449 --> 01:01:26.815
I just walked right 
 into the apartment,

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:29.251
right into your room,
 and took 'em.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:33.755
Just more lies, 
 'cause I burned those shoes.

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.758
I put them down
 the incinerator
 and burned them.

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:37.959
Nobody's got them.

01:02:46.163 --> 01:02:48.296
You better 
 give me those shoes.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.565
They're mine.
 Give them back to me.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.505
You'd better give
 them back to me, Leroy!

01:02:56.507 --> 01:02:58.640
I'm keeping them shoes!

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.863
Congratulations.

01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:36.298
You're back to
 being grounded again.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.432
Dad, no.
I can't stay here
any longer.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:40.802
Hey, this is our
house now, Hannah.
Get used to it.

01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:43.171
Dad, please!
If you would just listen to...

01:05:54.451 --> 01:05:55.917
Huh.

01:06:31.054 --> 01:06:32.587
David.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.133
Leave it!

01:06:45.135 --> 01:06:46.801
Wait! Wait! Wait.

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:49.037
Oh, it's in here somewhere.

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:55.677
Shit! Where is it,
where is it, where is it?

01:07:04.955 --> 01:07:07.655
Got it.

01:07:42.159 --> 01:07:46.594
"Forever together. 
 Lost love."

01:07:59.242 --> 01:08:02.677
"The patient is well
 on his way to
 having a severe case

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:05.980
"of extreme agoraphobia.

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.949
"He tends towards
 violent reactions.

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:12.954
"The patient also suffers
 from occasional
 homicidal ideations."

01:08:37.247 --> 01:08:39.314
David's
the boy in the window.

01:08:39.316 --> 01:08:41.116
She had a brother.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:43.984
So, you think
the Howes had a son,
but no one knew because...

01:08:43.987 --> 01:08:45.819
Because he had
a fear of open spaces.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.689
He never left the house.

01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:49.991
They were gonna
 commit him, but he...

01:08:49.993 --> 01:08:52.794
Okay... "He reacts violently
to new stimuli."

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:54.729
See?

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:56.231
He didn't want that.

01:08:56.233 --> 01:08:58.366
He killed his family.

01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:00.635
They wanted to take him away
from his home,

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:01.870
this house...

01:09:01.872 --> 01:09:04.339
And that's what set him off.

01:09:04.341 --> 01:09:06.107
Honey,

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.942
we're gonna call
this hospital and find out
what they know.

01:09:07.944 --> 01:09:10.178
Okay? It's doubtful
 they'll tell us anything.

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.747
But if they do,
 we'll call the police.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:15.049
All right?

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.752
We're gonna take
a look at this, sweetie.

01:09:27.930 --> 01:09:29.764
Where's that
phone number?

01:09:32.102 --> 01:09:33.768
I'm gonna call
the hospital.

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.704
Daddy!

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:18.406
He's here!

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:19.641
Dad!
Who's here?

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:21.576
Melanie! Melanie,
he's here!
Who? Who?

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:23.411
He's here!
He's downstairs!
Oh, my God! John!

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:24.479
Who?
David!

01:11:24.481 --> 01:11:25.913
There's someone here!

01:11:32.856 --> 01:11:35.590
Call the police! Go!
Dad! No!

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.026
Dad!
I'll call
the police.

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:39.694
You hit the panic button!

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:23.504
Police!

01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:30.011
Sir? Are you all right?

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:33.047
Sir, can you hear me?
Yeah.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:35.316
Just hang on.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:39.787
Is there anybody in here?

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:43.524
Come out where I can see you.
 With your hands up!

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.635
Lock him down.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:13.654
Detective Pascal
would like to
see you upstairs.

01:13:13.656 --> 01:13:15.022
Yeah.

01:13:37.714 --> 01:13:39.280
Ugh.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.920
This T-Shirt,
does it look familiar?

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.422
Yeah.

01:13:51.494 --> 01:13:52.693
Oh...

01:14:01.037 --> 01:14:04.172
Well, looks like, uh,
this guy has been living
in your attic

01:14:04.174 --> 01:14:06.707
for quite a long time.

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:09.977
You'd be surprised
how often it actually happens.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:13.014
Don't worry.

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:15.450
It's over.

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:24.992
So, there's a motel
not too far from here
if you guys wanna--

01:14:24.994 --> 01:14:26.527
Yes.
Absolutely.

01:14:29.065 --> 01:14:30.965
Let's get him
prepped. Put a line in.

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:09.070
Yeah.

01:15:56.219 --> 01:15:59.287
Hey,
 this is Tommy.
 Leave a message.

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:03.791
BP dropping.
Blood pressure's dropping.

01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:05.326
We're losing him.

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:44.265
We'll be downstairs.

01:16:48.538 --> 01:16:49.770
Hannah?

01:17:03.586 --> 01:17:04.719
Han?

01:17:20.236 --> 01:17:21.602
John?

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:25.239
John?

01:17:26.509 --> 01:17:28.109
John, where's Hannah?

01:17:28.111 --> 01:17:30.011
What do you mean?
She's not downstairs
with you?

01:17:30.013 --> 01:17:31.078
She was in her room.
I thought
she came downstairs,

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.847
but she's not here.

01:17:32.849 --> 01:17:34.348
Hannah!

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.250
Hannah?

01:17:36.252 --> 01:17:38.285
Hannah?

01:17:38.287 --> 01:17:40.254
Sweetie, where are you?

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:48.396
Hannah, can you hear me?

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:16.891
Come on, Hannah,
answer your phone.

01:18:31.107 --> 01:18:32.306
She's not outside.

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:33.441
It's going
straight to voicemail.

01:18:33.443 --> 01:18:35.242
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:18:48.758 --> 01:18:50.624
It's coming
from over there.

01:18:52.295 --> 01:18:54.895
I hear it.
It sounds like it's
coming from over here.

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.397
- Hannah?
- Hannah?

01:18:59.135 --> 01:19:00.601
Hannah?

Break through this wall
and get you out of here!

I'm gonna get you out!

01:21:20.343 --> 01:21:21.475
Help me get through!

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:26.413
Han,
 I just need you
 to calm down, okay?

01:21:26.415 --> 01:21:27.848
Hannah!
John!

01:21:27.850 --> 01:21:28.849
Dad!

01:21:28.851 --> 01:21:29.984
I found her!
I can't get her out!

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:32.553
Mel, he's coming!

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:33.687
Can you make it
up to the attic?

01:21:33.689 --> 01:21:35.623
Yes!
Do it now!

01:21:57.980 --> 01:21:59.213

Just keep going!
Get to the attic, okay?

01:22:17.667 --> 01:22:19.300
Your dad's gonna
 meet you there.

01:22:19.302 --> 01:22:21.168
How do I get to the attic?

01:22:21.170 --> 01:22:22.903

Follow the sound!

He's coming! No!

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:57.771

The door's shut!
Get out of the way!
