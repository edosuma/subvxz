I flagged them on a char line
I saw at the house.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.098
- You believe the sister?

12:13.100 --> 12:15.967
- I think it was arson.

12:15.969 --> 12:19.838
- A lot of things can
make a char line.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.273
Doesn't prove anything.

12:22.275 --> 12:25.176
- I didn't say it was proof.

12:25.178 --> 12:27.979
I said I flagged it.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.282
- Well, then there you go.
You did the right thing.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.893
- Hey, herrmann.
- Hey, mike.

12:47.067 --> 12:50.168
[no audible dialogue]

12:58.311 --> 13:00.078
- hey, james,
it's your father

13:00.080 --> 13:02.947
returning your text.
Look, I'd love to talk,

13:02.949 --> 13:06.084
but, uh...
I'm a phone guy.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.886
Call me back.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.288
[knock at door]

13:10.290 --> 13:14.025
oh, it's james,
my stepson.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.162
- Oh, it's james now?

13:17.164 --> 13:21.232
- Yeah, I guess, uh...
Jimmy was too young for him.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.834
- How's he doing?

13:22.836 --> 13:25.103
- He's 17.
Talks to me in 140 characters

13:25.105 --> 13:29.207
if he talks to me at all.
- Hmm.

13:29.209 --> 13:30.975
Heh...

13:30.977 --> 13:34.979
I remember when cindy put lee
henry into toddler gymnastics.

13:34.981 --> 13:38.049
And basically, they'd send him
down a little zip line,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.852
and he'd end up falling
ass over teakettle

13:40.854 --> 13:43.988
into, you know,
cushy blocks.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.157
He'd just laugh.

13:48.228 --> 13:52.130
Yesterday,
he asked me for a car.

13:52.132 --> 13:53.998
- Huh.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.268
Uh, my pops told me,
"you watch out now.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.138
Before you know it,
he's gonna be a man."

14:00.140 --> 14:04.209
and you blink, and--
- there it is.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.343
- Yeah.

14:08.148 --> 14:11.115
Did you need some...

14:11.117 --> 14:13.318
- Some of truck and I
are gonna stay up

14:13.320 --> 14:16.221
and watch out for this,
you know, tagger.

14:16.223 --> 14:19.290
Just letting you know.
- Yeah, you keep me posted.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.326
- Will do.

14:25.966 --> 14:29.567
[crickets chirping]

14:29.569 --> 14:32.203
[sighs]

14:32.205 --> 14:35.173
- [smacks lips]
well, I'm gonna grab a magazine.

14:35.175 --> 14:38.910
- You wanna read "cosmo"
or you wanna catch this guy?

14:40.981 --> 14:43.114
- Okay.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.152
- How long are we gonna go?

14:50.891 --> 14:53.324
- We'll go all night
if we have to.

14:53.326 --> 14:56.194
- Okay, I'm just trying to
figure out how to pace myself.

14:56.196 --> 14:59.097
- This guy defaced our house.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.932
- Mm.
- That's a middle finger

15:00.934 --> 15:02.467
to everyone of us.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.404
Let's buckle up.
- [claps]

15:09.442 --> 15:12.377
- are we gonna take shifts?

15:12.379 --> 15:14.946
Or...

15:16.683 --> 15:18.349
Never mind.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.221
- Lieutenant casey
and severide.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.089
This is alexa hubble from ofi.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.158
She's here to follow up
on the suspicious burn pattern

15:27.160 --> 15:29.260
that casey flagged.
- It's good to meet you both.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.062
- Likewise.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.699
- Now since you guys
were the nearest ones

15:34.700 --> 15:36.700
to the victim and her husband,
I just wanna get all the details

15:36.703 --> 15:39.103
before making a recommendation
to cpd.

15:39.105 --> 15:41.239
- What made you think
that it was a pour?

15:41.241 --> 15:42.440
- There was a char line.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.075
It went straight to the bedroom.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.176
Door was left open.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.478
No sign of breaking
and entering.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.380
If he wanted
to trap his wife in the fire,

15:49.382 --> 15:51.683
that's the way to do it.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.451
Also, I know this doesn't
prove anything,

15:53.453 --> 15:56.421
but the victim's sister came by.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.222
She thinks he did it.

15:58.224 --> 15:59.724
- She say why?

15:59.726 --> 16:02.460
- They fought,
all the time.

16:02.462 --> 16:06.064
Wife got scared,
and moved in with the sister.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.232
- Well, the husband claims
that he was having breakfast

16:08.234 --> 16:09.734
at a restaurant
when the fire started,

16:09.736 --> 16:12.003
but his alibi doesn't check out.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.171
There's no credit card receipt,

16:13.173 --> 16:17.408
and staff didn't recognize
the photo.

16:17.410 --> 16:19.444
- There you go.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.145
- Now you saw the husband
in the fire.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.248
- That's right.
- Anything suspicious there?

16:24.250 --> 16:27.151
- I don't think he did it.

16:27.153 --> 16:28.252
- Why not?

16:28.254 --> 16:29.754
- He was distraught.

16:29.756 --> 16:32.290
He was willing to die
to save her.

16:32.292 --> 16:33.691
It wasn't an act.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.259
I had to use everything
I had to keep him

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
from running headlong
into the fire.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.496
- What about the sister?
- I don't know.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.099
I have no idea.
I saw what I saw.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.767
There's no way that guy
wanted her dead.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.769

[sirens blaring]

16:57.484 --> 17:01.019
- [grunting and groaning]

17:04.424 --> 17:07.025
- my son fell out of the tree
on his back.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.359
He called me.
I called 911.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.094
We--uh, we live
right across the street.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.530
- Oh, god!
- Hold still, hold still.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.466
- Hang in there, alan.
Paramedics are here.

17:15.468 --> 17:17.535
- Can you feel my fingers?
- Yes.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.437
- What about your toes?
Can you wiggle them?

17:19.439 --> 17:22.073
- Yeah,
it's really just my stomach.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.342
- I don't see any contusions.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.144
- All right, alan,
we're gonna put a backboard

17:26.146 --> 17:28.246
under you, and then we're gonna
get you to a hospital, okay?

17:28.248 --> 17:31.049
- Okay.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.350
- Did he break a rib?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.118
- We're not sure.
We have to get x-rays.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.487
I'm gonna grab the stretcher.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.061
- What you doing up
in the tree anyway?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.395
- Looking for a date.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.497
It was a promposal.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.100
In this case, homecoming.
- Aw.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.069
- She wasn't even home.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.770
It was a total fail,
and then I slipped.

17:52.772 --> 17:55.506
- [laughs]
you see that?

17:55.508 --> 18:00.511
- Hey,
kid's suffered enough.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.180
- This is my fault.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.248
I wanted him to see
he has as much going for him

18:04.250 --> 18:07.118
as the next guy.
- [groans]

18:07.120 --> 18:10.254
- well,
sacrificing your body for love

18:10.256 --> 18:11.789
is pretty darn chivalrous.

18:11.791 --> 18:14.192
I'm sure once heather
hears about it,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.494
she'll swoon.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.262
- What'd I tell you, son?

18:42.589 --> 18:44.889
[stretcher rattles and clanks]

18:44.891 --> 18:46.657

18:48.862 --> 18:51.195
- I'll hang a bag.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.436
- Oh, my god.
Is he okay?

18:58.438 --> 18:59.437
- He fell.
He's gotta--

18:59.439 --> 19:01.139
- this is your fault.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.207
You put him up to this.

19:03.209 --> 19:05.827
Is he okay?

19:05.828 --> 19:08.446
- He's vomiting up blood.
It could be a perforated bowel.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.248
- We're taking him
to chicago med.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.617
- Hey, can we come along?
- No, I am coming along.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.385
You can take the car.

you can ride with us,

19:16.538 --> 19:18.688

with your son's treatment.

hang in there, buddy.

19:54.227 --> 19:55.893
- Ten toes up in the bunk room.

19:55.895 --> 19:58.229
- Deserters.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.433
All right--
- hello.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.735
[gasps]

and say hi.

- Really?
- Yeah.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.325

- Hey, donna.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.960

I'm gonna take a shower,

20:28.962 --> 20:30.528

- He is so much like you.

20:39.505 --> 20:41.239
- Yeah.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.741
That is my new candidate
right there.

he's running into fires.

Thank you.

- Say bye-bye.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.498
- Call for you.
Darin whitney?

21:07.500 --> 21:11.502
- Can you give him
my cell, connie?

21:11.504 --> 21:13.404
- Is that the husband?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.441
- Yeah, I guess the guy
wants to talk to me.

21:17.443 --> 21:19.577
- What about?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.445
- I'll know when I talk to him.

21:32.558 --> 21:36.294
I'm always gonna report
what my eyes and ears tell me.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.630
- So am I.

21:48.541 --> 21:50.408
- You don't understand.
I have to see him.

21:50.410 --> 21:52.343
I'll be quick.
Please.

21:52.345 --> 21:53.678
- We can't do that.
- Please!

21:53.680 --> 21:55.479
Alan almost died for me.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.582

but immediate family only.

21:59.519 --> 22:01.052
- Hi.
Sorry.

22:01.054 --> 22:02.753
Uh, you wouldn't happen
to be heather, would you?

22:02.755 --> 22:05.690
- Yes.
Oh, my god, can you help me?

like this were only in books.

What are ya--

22:16.336 --> 22:17.768

22:17.770 --> 22:19.670
- Came to see you,
goof ball.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.373
That was amazing,
what you did for me.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.576
- Oh, I was trying
to make it memorable.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.778
- Oh, it was.

22:27.780 --> 22:29.680
Are you, like, okay?

22:29.682 --> 22:33.484
- They're saying full recovery,
in time for--

22:33.486 --> 22:35.720
in time for Saturday even.

Yeah,
well about that...

Brian callahan already
asked me to homecoming.

No worries.
That happens.

- Yeah,
but the good news is

22:48.801 --> 22:50.701
you're, like, totally
famous now.

22:50.703 --> 22:53.704
You have over 100,000 hits

our kid is so freakin' cute,
I can't stand it.

23:11.657 --> 23:14.425
- Karra whitney's funeral
is tomorrow,

23:14.427 --> 23:16.394
the woman from the fire.
I was thinking about

23:16.396 --> 23:19.497
driving by there.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.933
Not to be a part of it
or anything, just to--

23:22.935 --> 23:24.835
just to see it.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.904
Pay my respects.

23:29.609 --> 23:32.877
- You sure that's a good idea?

23:32.879 --> 23:35.780
- I'm not sure about anything.

23:42.822 --> 23:46.624
- I just didn't know
who else to talk to.

23:46.626 --> 23:51.195
I...
I woke up this morning,

23:51.197 --> 23:55.666
reached for karra...

23:55.668 --> 23:57.701
- I get it.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.804
- I heard her screaming.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.739
She was right there.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.873
- It's not your fault.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.877
- It's yours.
You stopped me.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.513
I'm sorry, I--
I didn't mean that, I just--

24:09.515 --> 24:13.184
I don't know what
is even happening anymore.

24:13.186 --> 24:15.186
- Have you talked to anyone?

24:15.188 --> 24:18.489
There are counselors out there.
I can get you names.

24:18.491 --> 24:21.659
- I've talked
to arson investigators.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.893
[sighs]

24:22.895 --> 24:24.595
it's crazy.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.831
I would never hurt karra.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.766
I didn't even know she was home.
I was having breakfast

24:28.768 --> 24:30.734
when the fire started.

24:30.736 --> 24:31.936
- Where?

24:31.938 --> 24:34.872
- Uh, verdugo
on kinzie.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.808
- Did anyone see you there?

24:37.810 --> 24:40.478
- No one who remembers,
apparently.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.713
And the credit card machine was
broken, so I paid cash.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.583
I can't believe
this is happening.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.619
Anyway...

24:50.556 --> 24:52.857
Thank you for coming.

24:52.859 --> 24:54.758
And thank you
for everything you did.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.026

25:01.667 --> 25:03.534
I got it.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.975

Question,

26:43.936 --> 26:47.037
since you worked
some ofi investigations.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.138
- Shoot.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.990
- I drove by the restaurant

26:49.991 --> 26:51.841

he was at when the fire started.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.878

Probably not,

26:58.985 --> 27:02.086
unless somebody put in
a specific request.

27:02.088 --> 27:03.921
But I thought
they already said

27:03.923 --> 27:06.357
that his alibi didn't check out.

27:06.359 --> 27:08.659
- Just wondering.

27:10.997 --> 27:13.664

Alan's video is up to
a million hits on prom-fails.

to live down.

You got teenagers, right?

got me texting,

the fire started?

28:01.881 --> 28:04.815
- Char line headed
in that direction.

28:06.218 --> 28:09.219
- I heard darin whitney wasn't
home when the fire started.

28:09.221 --> 28:11.889
- Ofi can't find any proof.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.191
- What if it doesn't exist?

28:16.729 --> 28:19.129

you're too close to this.

- Maybe.

28:35.715 --> 28:38.716
But there was a char line
meant to trap her.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.284
I saw it.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.830

that we're fairly confident

you were using city property
for personal use--

29:37.943 --> 29:39.810

- And totally hot.

37:58.677 --> 38:02.579
- Tell us how you got
the idea for "sheets on fire."

38:02.581 --> 38:04.381
- uh...

38:05.284 --> 38:08.518
Well,
I was on the apparatus floor,

38:08.520 --> 38:11.755
looking at the hose bed,
and I thought,

38:11.757 --> 38:17.427
somewhere in the folds
of that hose, there's a story.

38:18.997 --> 38:22.599
[keys jangle]

38:22.601 --> 38:24.000
- thank god.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.702
- What's wrong?
- The guy in the car

38:25.704 --> 38:29.839
has been watching our house
for the past two hours.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.675
- You get a good look at him?
- No, it's too far,

38:31.677 --> 38:33.576
but, you know, I'm just
freaking out here, you know.

38:33.578 --> 38:36.079
I mean, terrance is inside and--
- okay, okay.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.814
Here.

[keys jangling]

38:47.025 --> 38:48.591
hey!
Wanna tell me why

38:48.593 --> 38:50.560
you parked there,
staring at my family?

38:50.562 --> 38:53.063
- I didn't mean to scare 'em.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.598
I just felt weird going in.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.736
- James...

39:00.772 --> 39:02.372
- What are you doing here?

39:02.374 --> 39:04.074
- You surprised me
with that text.

39:04.076 --> 39:05.675
Figured I'd do one better.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.411
Surprise you back.

39:08.413 --> 39:10.780
- Yeah.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.382
You did that.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.086
Come here.

39:16.088 --> 39:19.422
[gasps]

39:21.493 --> 39:23.393
donna!

39:23.395 --> 39:24.494
It's james.

39:24.496 --> 39:27.364
- [gasps]
hey.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.768
[laughter]
hey!

39:31.770 --> 39:34.904
[people chattering]

39:43.582 --> 39:44.814
- oh, wow.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.884
Ofi made their decision.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.552
- What did they say?

39:49.554 --> 39:53.823
- So they are not referring
darin's case to cpd.

39:53.825 --> 39:56.893
No arson or murder charges.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.899
- I found a city camera
that showed darin wasn't home

40:02.901 --> 40:04.667
when the fire started.

40:06.505 --> 40:10.874
I thought ofi should know.

40:10.876 --> 40:14.511
- Then he started the fire
another way.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.814
- He didn't do it.
- Yes, he did.

40:25.524 --> 40:27.424
And I'll prove it.

41:18.043 --> 41:18.541
