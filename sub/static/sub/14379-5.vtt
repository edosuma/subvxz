Grrr...

15:43.066 --> 15:45.466
That is it!

15:53.050 --> 15:58.150
Yes. After the moon
coming up twice

15:58.183 --> 16:01.116
and the sun
coming up 3 times,

16:01.150 --> 16:02.366
I have done it,

16:02.400 --> 16:06.350
the invention to solve
all my problems:

16:06.383 --> 16:09.050
The hypnosis pen.

16:09.083 --> 16:13.166
Anything I write will make
anyone do my bidding.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.333
Ha ha ha ha!

16:15.366 --> 16:22.316
And I will finally have
uninterrupted inventing time.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.066
There. That should keep
them all busy

17:01.100 --> 17:03.416
while I get back
to my experiments.

17:03.450 --> 17:06.400
All thanks to this pen.

17:06.433 --> 17:09.316
Yes, this pen that can alter
anyone's brain

17:09.350 --> 17:13.050
simply by writing
what you want down.

17:22.366 --> 17:25.433
Aha! At last,
my probe drone has returned.

17:25.466 --> 17:28.200
What secret Dexter
information do you have?

17:28.233 --> 17:31.416
Wow! Brain altering pen.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.033
It shall be mine.

17:34.066 --> 17:37.150
Yes! Perfect!

17:37.183 --> 17:40.350
Yes! Yes!

17:40.383 --> 17:44.400
Ooh...one drop. Yes.

17:45.466 --> 17:48.150
My experiments
are now complete

17:48.183 --> 17:49.450

my hypnosis pen,

17:49.483 --> 17:52.116
which I have placed
behind me

17:52.150 --> 17:54.166
and am sure
is perfectly safe.
