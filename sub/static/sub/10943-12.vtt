00:00.692 --> 00:02.960
<i>Previously on "Heartland":</i>

00:03.028 --> 00:04.461
<i>Why are you so
determined</i> <i>with this horse?</i>

00:05.864 --> 00:07.464
Oof!

00:07.532 --> 00:08.732
This horse is acting
exactly like Spartan did

00:08.799 --> 00:09.866
after the accident.

00:11.435 --> 00:13.069
He was this close
to being put down as well.

00:13.137 --> 00:13.937
<i>If Spartan can come back</i>
<i>from that,</i>

00:14.005 --> 00:15.404
<i>so can Alcatraz.</i>

00:16.607 --> 00:19.475
I need the brutal honest truth.

00:19.543 --> 00:21.210
Do you think Austin
is just using me?

00:22.446 --> 00:24.847
Ty, your dad...

00:24.914 --> 00:26.915
He's gone.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.651
He passed away.

00:31.287 --> 00:32.621
<i>I remember thinking</i> <i>that rock</i>

00:32.689 --> 00:34.389
<i>was the coolest thing</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

00:34.457 --> 00:36.659
And I grew up and I found out
it was worthless.

00:36.726 --> 00:38.627
Just fools gold.

00:38.695 --> 00:41.696
I hope you can find
a peaceful place for him.

00:42.665 --> 00:43.765
Eagle Lake.

01:11.292 --> 01:12.692
Look at you two.

01:12.759 --> 01:14.560
You couldn't even get
near him a month ago.

01:14.627 --> 01:15.995
I know.

01:16.063 --> 01:17.362
We've come a long way,
haven't we, Alcatraz?

01:17.430 --> 01:18.463
Yeah.

01:19.465 --> 01:21.133
So how about you?

01:21.201 --> 01:23.435
It's gonna be a beautiful day
for a ride.

01:23.503 --> 01:25.637
Oh, damn it!

01:27.074 --> 01:29.007
Um, yeah. Um...

01:29.075 --> 01:32.276
Look, Amy, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

01:32.344 --> 01:33.544
Is it about our trip?

01:33.612 --> 01:35.546
Look, I hate to do this,
it's just um...

01:35.614 --> 01:37.281
I wanna go up there by myself.

01:37.349 --> 01:39.483
Are you sure, Ty?
I cleared my schedule.

01:39.551 --> 01:41.853
I know. I know.
It's just...

01:41.921 --> 01:43.088
Um, this is just something...
You know,

01:43.155 --> 01:44.855
it's not really a weekend off
for me,

01:44.923 --> 01:46.190
it's something a little
more than that, so...

01:46.257 --> 01:47.891
I know.

01:47.959 --> 01:49.226
Eagle Lake's the only place that
my family has ever gone together

01:49.293 --> 01:51.428
for like a family vacation thing, so...
I know.

01:51.495 --> 01:53.931
It's where I have some of
the best memories of my dad...

01:53.998 --> 01:57.534
It's the perfect place
to spread his ashes.

01:57.602 --> 01:59.803
Yeah...
So, if uh...

01:59.871 --> 02:02.839
I just need to do it by myself.

02:03.807 --> 02:04.974
Okay.

02:06.043 --> 02:07.810
Okay. Okay.

02:24.794 --> 02:27.328
Sorry, I was just
looking for Mallory.

02:27.396 --> 02:29.464
She's in the barn.

02:29.531 --> 02:30.565
Thanks.

02:33.301 --> 02:34.334
It's okay.

02:41.176 --> 02:43.778
You freaked me out.
What're you doing here?

02:43.845 --> 02:45.646
I just wanted to say I'm sorry,

02:45.713 --> 02:46.981
for being such a...

02:47.048 --> 02:50.516
Manipulating, self-serving,
two-faced,

02:50.584 --> 02:52.652
country singing wannabe?

02:52.719 --> 02:54.921
I was just going with jerk.

02:54.989 --> 02:55.955
Is there any way we can talk?

02:56.023 --> 02:57.323
Save your breath,

02:57.391 --> 02:58.591
I'm not sending any messages
to my dad.

02:58.659 --> 03:00.160
Okay, I admit it.

03:00.227 --> 03:03.029
<i>Look, I was using you</i>
<i>to get to him at first.</i>

03:03.097 --> 03:05.998
But somewhere along the way,
I fell for you.

03:06.065 --> 03:08.167
Like rain from the sky,
I fell for you.

03:09.769 --> 03:12.805
Is that like a line
from one of your lame songs?

03:12.872 --> 03:15.507
Don't you have a "Country Idol"
audition to be at?

03:15.574 --> 03:17.609
Come on, Mallory.

03:17.677 --> 03:20.779
Is there no way
we can get past this?

03:22.314 --> 03:24.715
Aghhhhh!

03:24.783 --> 03:26.550
What?! Come on!

03:35.994 --> 03:37.527
What's up with
the waterlogged dude?

03:37.594 --> 03:41.231
I don't know, but I'm sure
I'll find out in a minute.

03:41.299 --> 03:43.700
Amy, I just wanted to...

03:43.767 --> 03:44.968
Stop by to see you
before I left

03:45.036 --> 03:47.237
to make sure that you were
okay with this?

03:47.305 --> 03:49.206
I just wanna get this
over with, okay?

03:49.273 --> 03:50.307
Yeah.

03:51.841 --> 03:53.207
Come here.

03:58.448 --> 04:01.383
Hey, Lou has made some
really good muffins.

04:01.451 --> 04:02.918
Did she?

04:02.986 --> 04:04.653
So you should probably pack
a few for your trip.

04:04.721 --> 04:06.088
All right.

04:08.591 --> 04:10.058
See ya.
See ya.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.935
Ty, how's it going?

04:21.003 --> 04:23.171
Hey! I heard a rumour
about some fresh muffins.

04:23.239 --> 04:25.772
Yup. Help yourself.

04:27.942 --> 04:30.978
Was that your Norton
I heard out there?

04:31.045 --> 04:32.612
Uh, yeah.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.348
You hittin' the road?

04:34.415 --> 04:35.349
Yep.

04:35.416 --> 04:37.417
Yeah?
Where to?

04:37.485 --> 04:38.919
Uh, Eagle Lake.

04:38.987 --> 04:39.987
Well, that's quite a ways,

04:40.054 --> 04:43.022
but a beautiful stretch
of road.

04:43.090 --> 04:44.656
Okay, I'll see you later, Jack.

04:44.724 --> 04:47.260
Hey, is everything okay?

04:48.628 --> 04:50.396
Yeah, I'm good.

04:52.032 --> 04:53.399
Ride safe.

06:04.759 --> 06:08.195
Oh, sorry.
What is with you?

06:08.536 --> 06:10.271
Ty just left for Eagle Lake.

06:10.339 --> 06:12.506
Without you?
He just ditched you?

06:12.574 --> 06:13.907
Well, no.

06:13.976 --> 06:17.377
It's a lot more complicated
than that.

06:17.445 --> 06:18.845
You going on a trip
or something?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.547
It's Katie's first "makin'
music with mommy" class.

06:21.615 --> 06:22.882
She's 8-months-old.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.284
What kind of music
do they expect her to make?

06:24.352 --> 06:25.818
Music is very important
for babies her age,

06:25.886 --> 06:27.187
I'll have you know.

06:27.254 --> 06:28.754
It teaches them
cognitive development,

06:28.822 --> 06:32.392
comprehensive skills,
phonological processing...

06:32.460 --> 06:33.892
Seriously, Lou, what is that?

06:33.960 --> 06:37.262
Okay, I've got snacks,
wipes, diapers, lotion...

06:37.330 --> 06:38.597
Maracas!

06:38.664 --> 06:40.399
<i>I am good to go.</i>

06:42.369 --> 06:46.838
Lou, might you be
forgetting something?

06:46.906 --> 06:47.939
What?

06:49.541 --> 06:51.376
The baby!
Right.

06:53.945 --> 06:57.743
So... what was that
about Eagle Lake?

06:59.551 --> 07:01.619
Ty and I were supposed
to go up there together.

07:01.686 --> 07:02.920
Why didn't you?

07:02.988 --> 07:04.922
You promise you
won't say anything?

07:04.990 --> 07:06.623
Okay.

07:06.690 --> 07:09.159
He's spreading his dad's
ashes up there.

07:09.227 --> 07:11.161
Well, it's a beautiful place
to do it.

07:11.229 --> 07:12.195
<i>Yeah.</i>

07:13.364 --> 07:15.198
I'm just worried about him.

07:15.266 --> 07:16.799
This morning,
I went up to see him

07:16.867 --> 07:18.068
and he could barely check
the tire pressure

07:18.136 --> 07:20.904
his hands were shaking
so badly.

07:20.971 --> 07:22.671
He's just been a bundle
of nerves lately,

07:22.739 --> 07:25.041
and I can't help thinking
that's a long road trip

07:25.108 --> 07:28.144
for him to go alone on
right now.

07:29.946 --> 07:32.314
You're probably right.

07:48.263 --> 07:49.729
Can I warm that coffee up
for you?

07:49.797 --> 07:52.699
Uh, please.
You new here?

07:52.767 --> 07:54.768
Uh, no, I'm the manager.

07:54.835 --> 07:55.969
I'm sorry.

07:56.037 --> 07:57.337
I was in a few times last week,

07:57.405 --> 07:59.306
and I definitely would've
remembered your smile.

07:59.374 --> 08:01.475
I was out of town,
in London, actually.

08:01.543 --> 08:03.609
London? Really.
Man, I love London.

08:03.677 --> 08:04.843
Oh, you've been?

08:04.911 --> 08:06.712
Yeah. I went and visited
a buddy of mine

08:06.780 --> 08:08.281
that I served with
in Afghanistan.

08:08.348 --> 08:09.748
He lives in Hampstead.

08:09.816 --> 08:11.684
Oh, yeah. I spent some time
in that area.

08:11.751 --> 08:14.220
I was at that famous pub.

08:14.354 --> 08:15.588
The Magdella?

08:15.655 --> 08:18.023
Yes! Do you know why
it's so famous?

08:18.092 --> 08:19.591
Best selection of beer
in the city.

08:19.658 --> 08:21.093
Well, that,

08:21.160 --> 08:22.660
and it's where Ruth Ellis
shot her boyfriend dead

08:22.728 --> 08:24.996
in the fifties.

08:25.064 --> 08:27.999
She was the last woman
to be hanged in England.

08:28.067 --> 08:29.634
That's pretty cool, actually.

08:29.735 --> 08:30.802
It's not as cool
as the Guinness

08:30.869 --> 08:31.903
and the root beer shooters,
but...

08:31.971 --> 08:33.205
It's a good fact.

08:33.272 --> 08:34.239
<i>Soraya!</i>

08:34.307 --> 08:35.639
Hey!

08:35.707 --> 08:36.907
Welcome back.
Oh, thanks!

08:36.975 --> 08:38.008
I have so much
we need to talk about.

08:38.076 --> 08:39.610
How're you?!
I'm okay.

08:39.677 --> 08:42.145
Amy?!

08:42.214 --> 08:43.447
Bryce?!

08:43.515 --> 08:45.649
Hey!
How's it going?

08:45.717 --> 08:47.179
Great, actually.

08:47.252 --> 08:48.632
You guys know each other?

08:48.695 --> 08:50.829
Yeah. Bryce is one
of Caleb's rodeo buddies.

08:51.288 --> 08:53.756
Yeah, actually, Amy helped me
with one of my horses.

08:53.824 --> 08:55.625
Honestly, first she kicked
my rear-end,

08:55.692 --> 08:56.692
then she helped me
with the horse.

08:57.861 --> 08:58.995
So are you still riding?

08:59.062 --> 09:00.330
Yeah.
You know what?

09:00.397 --> 09:01.431
I would really love for you
to come by

09:01.499 --> 09:02.832
and see what I've been up to.

09:02.899 --> 09:04.200
Can you swing by my ranch,
say in about an hour?

09:04.268 --> 09:05.468
O-kay.

09:06.470 --> 09:08.036
Cool.
Nice meeting you...

09:08.104 --> 09:09.138
Uh, Soraya.

09:17.413 --> 09:18.614
See you, guys.

09:38.993 --> 09:40.691
<i>Pick a card,</i> <i>any card...</i>

09:45.312 --> 09:47.313
<i>Ty used to love this
trick</i> <i>when he was a kid.</i>

09:47.841 --> 09:49.976
<i>He used to think</i>
<i>I was some kind of a magician.</i>

09:50.044 --> 09:51.411
<i>That's okay, dad,</i>
<i>I think everyone's tired.</i>

09:51.479 --> 09:53.112
Ah, it's all right.
Come on.

09:53.181 --> 09:54.247
<i>I'm not tired,</i> 
<i>I wanna see the trick.</i>

09:54.315 --> 09:55.881
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

09:55.948 --> 09:57.676
<i>Is this your card?</i>

09:57.765 --> 09:59.699
Oh my God, how did you do that?

10:02.348 --> 10:04.783
<i>You're so full of
crap,</i> <i>you know that?!</i>

10:04.905 --> 10:06.273
<i>You left</i> <i>and I got beat up!</i>

10:06.310 --> 10:07.476
<i>How's that any different</i>
<i>from when I was a kid?!</i>

10:07.794 --> 10:08.927
Wait, that's not fair.

10:08.995 --> 10:11.296
That was a long time ago
and I...

10:11.363 --> 10:12.363
I thought you and your mom

10:12.431 --> 10:14.118
would be better off without me.

10:14.179 --> 10:15.746
<i>Well, you were wrong.</i>

10:15.901 --> 10:19.070
Way to go, buddy.

10:30.848 --> 10:31.982
Dammit!

10:32.042 --> 10:33.443
Whoa, rebel.
Whoa.

10:37.121 --> 10:38.154
<i>It's okay, Randy,</i>

10:38.223 --> 10:39.756
you're getting closer
each time.

10:39.824 --> 10:40.790
<i>Call it a day, huh?</i>

10:40.858 --> 10:41.891
All right.

10:57.307 --> 10:58.541
I don't get it.

10:58.609 --> 11:00.942
My throw keeps coming up short.

11:01.009 --> 11:02.143
Well, to be honest,

11:02.211 --> 11:03.612
it's 'cause
you're not close enough.

11:03.679 --> 11:04.613
See, you gotta remember,
these legs are limp noodles now,

11:04.680 --> 11:05.880
right?

11:05.948 --> 11:06.881
Got no more power
from the waste down,

11:06.949 --> 11:08.550
so you gotta get up real close.

11:08.618 --> 11:10.252
You'll get it.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.653
All right.

11:11.721 --> 11:12.687
See you tomorrow?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.456
Yeah you will.

11:16.088 --> 11:18.123
Nice work.
Thanks.

11:19.070 --> 11:21.338
That was pretty impressive.

11:22.430 --> 11:23.397
I've been working
with injured riders

11:23.465 --> 11:25.065
for the past six months.

11:25.133 --> 11:27.234
Kinda use a little
rodeo training just to,

11:27.302 --> 11:28.702
you know, help build
some confidence.

11:28.770 --> 11:30.604
Wasn't enough
just to get them on a horse?

11:30.672 --> 11:32.071
Well, I mean, anybody
can teach that part.

11:32.139 --> 11:33.539
Thanks.

11:33.674 --> 11:35.141
You're welcome.

11:35.208 --> 11:36.709
Hey, rebel.

11:38.379 --> 11:40.747
Wow, he's doing really well
with those voice cues, huh?

11:40.814 --> 11:42.214
Yes, he is.

11:42.283 --> 11:43.383
You know, poor guy,

11:43.450 --> 11:44.550
I'm working him
to the bone though.

11:44.618 --> 11:45.518
I could probably use
a second horse.

11:45.586 --> 11:47.386
Well, I've got a few
new horses.

11:47.453 --> 11:49.187
One of them might be suited
to this type of work.

11:49.255 --> 11:51.222
Really? I should come by,
take a look.

11:51.291 --> 11:52.324
Yeah, sounds good.

12:44.874 --> 12:47.175
So, what do you say, angel?

12:48.712 --> 12:51.746
Will you give me one more shot?

13:12.667 --> 13:15.301
Well, it's good thing
you ride like an old man.

13:15.370 --> 13:17.504
I wasn't sure
if I could catch up to you.

13:17.572 --> 13:19.005
What are you doing here?

13:19.073 --> 13:22.008
I figured you might
use some company.

13:22.076 --> 13:25.378
Well, you're wasting
your time and your gas.

13:25.445 --> 13:27.179
I'm doing this alone, Jack.

13:27.247 --> 13:30.048
I see you didn't check
for road closures either.

13:30.116 --> 13:32.618
Don't worry,
we can get there this way.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.886
Come on.

13:49.535 --> 13:50.702
So grampa just rode after him?

13:50.770 --> 13:52.837
Yeah.
And I'm glad he did,

13:52.905 --> 13:54.939
but I hope Ty
doesn't freak out.

13:55.007 --> 13:56.774
He's not himself lately.

13:56.841 --> 13:58.308
You're really worried
about him.

13:59.577 --> 14:02.279
Well, this has been
really hard on Ty.

14:02.346 --> 14:05.883
But I just wish that
he'd tell me how he's feeling.

14:05.950 --> 14:07.984
<i>- Chuga-chuga chuga-chuga.</i>

14:08.052 --> 14:09.553
Seriously, Lou?

14:09.621 --> 14:11.687
No, I'm listening.
Don't worry.

14:11.755 --> 14:13.956
I just wish that
he would talk to me,

14:14.024 --> 14:15.892
and I would know
what's going on in his head...

14:15.959 --> 14:17.827
Chou, chou, chou!

14:19.463 --> 14:20.696
Sorry.
No, I am listening.

14:20.764 --> 14:22.498
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

14:22.566 --> 14:24.099
Austin wrote me a song.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.001
That guy you hosed down
this morning?

14:26.069 --> 14:28.570
Yeah, and he still came back
to sing it to me.

14:28.638 --> 14:30.539
So I said I'd go out with him.

14:30.606 --> 14:31.840
<i>Am I crazy?</i>

14:31.908 --> 14:33.742
No, no, no.
That is the power of music.

14:33.810 --> 14:34.876
You guys should've seen Katie

14:34.944 --> 14:36.411
<i>in her class this morning.</i>

14:36.479 --> 14:39.514
She was shaking the maracas
and bouncing around...

14:39.582 --> 14:41.015
Weren't you, honey?

14:41.083 --> 14:43.517
Who's my hip hop, baby?
Who's my little Beyonce?

14:43.585 --> 14:44.618
O-kay.

14:45.954 --> 14:46.987
What?

14:49.390 --> 14:51.559
It's you, honey.
It's you!

15:30.196 --> 15:31.529
So what? You just decided
to hop on your bike

15:31.597 --> 15:33.397
and follow me up here?

15:33.465 --> 15:35.533
Something like that.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.301
<i>I gotta say,</i>
<i>after an hour on that gravel,</i>

15:37.369 --> 15:40.738
I was about ready
to turn back, but...

15:41.707 --> 15:43.808
<i>I'm sure glad I didn't.</i>

15:48.813 --> 15:49.946
This is Janoah,

15:50.014 --> 15:51.247
the horse I was telling
you about.

15:51.315 --> 15:53.249
Hey, Janoah,
how you doin', boy?

15:53.317 --> 15:55.318
He's really patient and calm.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.586
Calm, huh?

15:56.654 --> 15:58.688
More like calm-o-tose.

15:58.756 --> 16:00.289
I prefer horses
with a little more spirit,

16:00.357 --> 16:01.625
like rebel.

16:05.094 --> 16:05.961
What's his name?

16:06.029 --> 16:08.363
Alcatraz Run.

16:10.233 --> 16:13.101
Look at him.

16:13.169 --> 16:15.538
This is what I'm talking about.

16:15.605 --> 16:17.172
<i>Bryce, he's a thoroughbred.</i>

16:17.240 --> 16:19.174
Yeah, I won't hold that
against him.

16:21.577 --> 16:23.845
Yeah, he matches rebel.
I want him.

16:27.516 --> 16:30.084
<i>Trust me, you don't.</i>

16:32.621 --> 16:35.722
- So...
- You've been up here before?

16:35.790 --> 16:38.391
Yeah, a long time ago.

16:38.459 --> 16:40.226
With your family?

16:41.195 --> 16:42.930
Yeah. Why?

16:42.997 --> 16:46.433
Your dad must be
on your mind a lot.

16:49.571 --> 16:51.538
Is that why you
followed me up here?

16:51.605 --> 16:53.272
<i>Did Amy tell you?</i>

16:53.339 --> 16:54.406
We were concerned.

16:56.777 --> 16:59.178
Well, of course we would be!
What do you think?

16:59.245 --> 17:00.345
I think y'all keep watching me

17:00.413 --> 17:01.346
out of the corner of your eye,

17:01.414 --> 17:03.282
waiting to see
if I'm gonna crack!

17:03.349 --> 17:04.550
Well, I'm not, okay?

17:06.019 --> 17:07.685
People die.

17:07.752 --> 17:08.853
I didn't come
all the way up here

17:08.921 --> 17:10.354
to make a big deal out of it.

17:10.422 --> 17:12.123
I just wanna release the ashes
and get on with my life.

17:14.193 --> 17:15.794
You know what?

17:15.861 --> 17:17.061
I'm gonna get it over with
right now,

17:17.128 --> 17:20.031
so you can all stop
worrying about me.

17:26.419 --> 17:28.185
<i>I don't think this</i>
<i>is gonna work, Bryce.</i>

17:28.252 --> 17:29.587
It takes a lot
to gain his trust,

17:29.654 --> 17:32.189
and when he spooks,
it can be really dangerous.

17:32.257 --> 17:33.957
I'm not very threatening
from down here.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.025
Well, it's gonna
take a long time

17:35.093 --> 17:37.127
to teach him voice cues.

17:37.195 --> 17:38.229
That's okay, I can do it.

17:38.296 --> 17:39.363
You know, I taught rebel,

17:39.431 --> 17:41.398
and I started with these.

17:41.466 --> 17:42.799
Well, he's not gonna
like whips.

17:44.268 --> 17:45.535
Well, I only use them
to apply pressure

17:45.603 --> 17:47.203
the same way you would
with your legs.

17:47.271 --> 17:48.538
<i>Once he understands</i>
<i>what I'm asking from him,</i>

17:48.606 --> 17:50.773
then I can initiate
the voice cues.

17:50.841 --> 17:53.710
I'm sorry, Bryce,
I can't let you work with him.

17:53.777 --> 17:55.712
You don't understand,
this is an abused horse.

17:55.779 --> 17:57.247
When I first got him
he was crazy,

17:57.314 --> 17:59.515
and sometimes he still is.

18:02.051 --> 18:04.386
Everyday, I work on restoring
people's confidence.

18:04.454 --> 18:06.755
This is what I do now.

18:06.822 --> 18:09.291
So maybe I can work my magic
on Alcatraz.

18:09.359 --> 18:12.427
Maybe I can teach him
to trust again.

18:15.931 --> 18:18.366
May I see those please?

18:23.272 --> 18:25.306
Alcatraz, good boy.

18:29.711 --> 18:30.811
<i>All right.</i>

18:30.879 --> 18:32.445
<i>You see this?</i>

18:32.513 --> 18:35.282
They're not gonna
hurt you, okay?

18:36.317 --> 18:37.450
You're all right.

18:39.287 --> 18:40.787
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>Hey, hey...</i>

18:41.855 --> 18:43.456
It's okay, Alcatraz.

18:43.524 --> 18:45.325
Come on, buddy.

18:45.393 --> 18:47.193
They're not gonna hurt ya.

18:48.662 --> 18:49.695
<i>Hey, hey...</i>

18:50.863 --> 18:52.331
All right, fine.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.032
You wanna run?
Run!

18:55.134 --> 18:57.603
<i>I know you're in</i>
<i>one of your moods.</i>

19:04.510 --> 19:05.777
Okay, so it wasn't
a great start,

19:05.844 --> 19:07.178
but I can get him
used to the whips.

19:07.245 --> 19:08.680
Bryce,
you've gotta let this go.

19:08.747 --> 19:09.880
I can make a connection
with him.

19:09.948 --> 19:10.748
I'm not gonna sell him to you

19:10.816 --> 19:11.916
and that's final.

19:30.167 --> 19:32.268
<i>Ty, I'm sorry.</i>

19:39.108 --> 19:42.845
<i>I didn't mean to cause</i>
<i>all this trouble.</i>

19:44.748 --> 19:49.885
<i>I thought you and your mom</i>
<i>would be better off without me.</i>

19:58.394 --> 20:01.929
<i>Ty, I don't expect you</i>
<i>to forgive me,</i>

20:04.066 --> 20:07.235
<i>but I do hope I can be</i>
<i>part of your life again.</i>

20:07.302 --> 20:08.569
Why don't you come with me?

20:08.636 --> 20:10.471
You'll get a chance
to see the Grand Canyon.

20:14.776 --> 20:17.978
<i>Promise me</i>
<i>you'll think about it.</i>

20:36.096 --> 20:37.530
Oof! Agh!

20:39.366 --> 20:40.699
Mallory, how many times
have I told you,

20:40.767 --> 20:42.967
you leave your muddy boots
outside?

20:43.035 --> 20:44.969
Whoa, someone's cranky!

20:45.037 --> 20:46.838
What's with you?

20:46.906 --> 20:48.673
Bryce...
He's just so stubborn.

20:48.741 --> 20:49.875
Guys, guys, guys...

20:49.942 --> 20:51.725
You have to check this out.

20:53.946 --> 20:55.113
<i>Listen to her sing.</i>

20:55.180 --> 20:56.381
<i>Oh my God,</i> <i>how cute is that?</i>

20:56.448 --> 20:59.784
These music lessons
are totally paying off.

20:59.851 --> 21:01.585
Lou, you've got to stop.

21:01.653 --> 21:03.120
What's your problem?

21:03.187 --> 21:04.455
Do you remember
what Marnie was like

21:04.523 --> 21:06.123
when Jerry junior was a baby?

21:06.190 --> 21:08.793
She was all about his smiles,
and his laughs,

21:08.860 --> 21:10.160
and his burps, and his poops...

21:10.228 --> 21:11.829
I'm not one of those moms!

21:11.897 --> 21:14.798
Lou, you thought
this was singing.

21:16.266 --> 21:18.167
Okay, you know what?
I'm proud of my daughter.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.368
What is so wrong with that?

21:19.437 --> 21:21.103
Nothing.
We think she's great too,

21:21.171 --> 21:23.406
but lately, all you can
talk about is the baby.

21:23.474 --> 21:25.174
That is so not true.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.744
Fine, you know what?
I'll prove it to you.

21:27.812 --> 21:29.711
Me and you,
dinner tonight at Maggie's.

21:29.779 --> 21:31.046
No baby talk.

21:31.113 --> 21:32.347
<i>All right, you're on.</i>

21:32.415 --> 21:33.982
Uh, hello?
You just assume I'll babysit?

21:34.050 --> 21:35.050
I have plans tonight.

21:35.117 --> 21:36.552
C'mon, Mallory,

21:36.619 --> 21:38.854
when do Amy and I ever get
a sisters' night out?

21:38.922 --> 21:40.322
I'll pay you double the usual.

21:40.389 --> 21:41.990
Triple?

21:42.058 --> 21:43.592
Double and a half.

21:44.526 --> 21:47.061
Fine. I guess I can change
my plans around a little.

21:47.128 --> 21:48.896
Thank you. Nice.

21:55.938 --> 21:57.939
Oh...
Back already?

21:58.006 --> 22:00.074
Uh, was it the coffee
or the smile?

22:00.141 --> 22:01.975
It was your friend, actually.

22:02.042 --> 22:03.376
Yeah. Amy's the most
stubborn girl

22:03.444 --> 22:04.678
that I've ever met.

22:04.745 --> 22:05.979
Yes, well, Amy can be that way,

22:06.046 --> 22:07.681
but it's usually
because she's right, so.

22:07.748 --> 22:08.782
Oh, yeah?

22:08.850 --> 22:10.750
Well, she's not right
this time.

22:10.818 --> 22:11.818
I just need to find a way
to prove it to her.

22:11.886 --> 22:13.219
You have any advice?

22:13.287 --> 22:14.988
Good luck with that.

22:15.055 --> 22:16.055
Thanks.

22:17.491 --> 22:19.224
Hey, um...

22:19.292 --> 22:21.727
Thought maybe you'd wanna
borrow that.

22:21.795 --> 22:24.930
"A guide to London's most
interesting and unusual pubs."

22:24.998 --> 22:26.298
Well, if you like the Magdella,

22:26.366 --> 22:27.900
you're definitely gonna dig
some of those places.

22:27.968 --> 22:29.969
Yeah, this is...
This is so cool.

22:30.036 --> 22:31.103
I'm actually going there
in the new year.

22:31.170 --> 22:33.905
Really?
I'm planning to go myself.

22:33.973 --> 22:35.439
When are you thinking of going?

22:35.508 --> 22:37.742
Maybe we could check out
some of these haunts together.

22:37.810 --> 22:40.545
Uh, yeah,
that-that would be great,

22:40.613 --> 22:43.080
I just um...
I can't.

22:43.148 --> 22:45.282
I've got sort of...

22:45.350 --> 22:47.418
No need to explain.

22:48.387 --> 22:49.686
Enjoy the book.

22:49.754 --> 22:50.787
Thanks.

22:58.696 --> 22:59.663
<i>Ty!</i>

23:00.765 --> 23:01.798
Ty...

23:03.167 --> 23:04.867
I should never have
followed you up here,

23:04.935 --> 23:05.902
and I'm sorry.

23:05.969 --> 23:07.703
I wanted to say something.

23:07.771 --> 23:09.739
I don't know,
I just wanted to say something,

23:09.806 --> 23:11.774
and I clammed up.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.111
He's gone, Jack,

23:16.179 --> 23:18.047
he's really gone.

23:19.115 --> 23:20.582
Well, you made your peace now.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.716
It's over.

23:21.784 --> 23:23.919
No, it's not.
I couldn't do it.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.888
I didn't know how
to say goodbye.

23:39.356 --> 23:41.724
<i>Sorry,</i> <i>I kinda lost it there.</i>

23:41.792 --> 23:43.826
No need to explain.

23:44.795 --> 23:47.163
I've just had a lot
on my mind and...

23:47.231 --> 23:49.031
I haven't really figured out
how to deal with it yet.

23:49.099 --> 23:51.733
Well, no wonder.
You just lost your father.

23:51.801 --> 23:53.435
Yeah.

23:58.074 --> 23:59.040
<i>But in a weird</i> <i>sort of way</i>

23:59.109 --> 24:00.775
I always felt like
I was the parent

24:00.843 --> 24:02.944
and he was the kid.

24:07.149 --> 24:08.048
You know, you've been more
of a father to me

24:08.117 --> 24:10.084
than he ever was.

24:13.322 --> 24:14.589
You know, my mom thought
it'd be better

24:14.656 --> 24:17.291
if she came up to tell me
about my dad in person.

24:17.359 --> 24:20.961
But I gotta say,
after seeing her again...

24:21.963 --> 24:24.999
Opened some old wounds, huh?

24:25.066 --> 24:27.101
When I was growing up,

24:27.168 --> 24:30.270
my mom was such
a carefree person,

24:30.338 --> 24:34.108
funny - she was always trying
to make us laugh - and...

24:34.175 --> 24:37.377
My dad just sorta
wore her down.

24:39.312 --> 24:42.949
He was a tough guy
to live with, you know?

24:43.017 --> 24:46.385
And then Wade came along,
and uh...

24:47.320 --> 24:52.458
It's like she became this...
Completely different person.

24:54.193 --> 24:57.529
I don't understand why
she went back to him.

24:57.596 --> 24:59.665
Well, maybe she loves him.

24:59.732 --> 25:03.368
Or at least maybe
she thinks she does.

25:05.038 --> 25:07.438
You know, I went through
the same thing with Marion.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.340
Tim was real nasty back
when he was drinking too much

25:10.408 --> 25:12.209
<i>and hooked on pills,</i>

25:12.277 --> 25:14.511
and I wanted him
out of her life.

25:14.579 --> 25:17.581
But she figured
she could help him beat it.

25:17.649 --> 25:20.517
Boy, it was tough
just sittin' there,

25:20.585 --> 25:23.287
watching her take
all his B.S.

25:23.354 --> 25:24.421
What're you talking about?

25:24.489 --> 25:26.556
You threw Tim out on his butt.

25:26.623 --> 25:27.991
Well, a man has his limits,

25:28.059 --> 25:30.994
and it was my house, dammit.

25:32.229 --> 25:33.930
But I...

25:33.998 --> 25:36.299
I made sure that Marion knew

25:36.366 --> 25:37.867
I was closing the door on Tim

25:37.935 --> 25:39.468
and not her.

25:42.806 --> 25:43.906
Anyway...

25:47.476 --> 25:48.744
So there's Cam,

25:48.812 --> 25:50.979
swinging a sparkly hula hoop
around the office,

25:51.047 --> 25:52.614
and he knocks
an entire can of pop

25:52.682 --> 25:55.718
all over Lynn's laptop -
his boss.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.352
Did he get fired?

25:57.420 --> 25:59.620
No, but there are no more
hula hoop Fridays.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.889
Your office sounds
like so much fun.

26:01.957 --> 26:03.557
It is.
I have to admit,

26:03.625 --> 26:05.827
it's a break for me, you know?

26:05.894 --> 26:08.062
Look, I love Katie
more than anything,

26:08.130 --> 26:11.498
but she is so much work,
you know?

26:11.600 --> 26:13.400
And it starts everyday
at six o'clock

26:13.468 --> 26:15.468
when she screams like
I haven't fed her in a...

26:15.536 --> 26:17.303
Lou.
Month.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.240
Enough about Katie.

26:20.307 --> 26:22.175
How's Ty?

26:22.243 --> 26:23.610
To be honest,

26:23.677 --> 26:25.846
your guess is as good as mine.

26:25.913 --> 26:28.815
That doesn't sound good.

26:28.883 --> 26:30.149
I don't know,

26:30.217 --> 26:33.652
he's dealing with
the death of his dad,

26:34.587 --> 26:37.322
and then there's
his mom and Wade...

26:38.458 --> 26:41.193
Mm. Sorry.
It's just a reminder.

26:41.261 --> 26:42.427
For what?

26:42.495 --> 26:44.363
Mm. It's nothing.

26:44.430 --> 26:45.697
It's to check on Katie,
isn't it?

26:45.765 --> 26:46.597
No!

26:48.600 --> 26:49.834
Maybe.

26:51.403 --> 26:52.503
Go ahead.
You've done a lot better

26:52.571 --> 26:54.239
than I thought you would.

26:54.306 --> 26:56.074
You know what?
I don't have to,

26:56.142 --> 26:57.541
because I trust Mallory,

26:57.609 --> 27:01.079
and I know she's giving Katie
her undivided attention.

27:07.518 --> 27:09.219
So are you sure it's okay
for me to be here?

27:09.287 --> 27:10.387
Of course not,

27:10.454 --> 27:12.522
but Lou will check in
at some point,

27:12.590 --> 27:14.992
and then I'm gonna have
to kick you out.

27:15.059 --> 27:16.093
Cool.

27:16.560 --> 27:18.895
So we have some time.

27:25.535 --> 27:27.904
I think we need popcorn.

27:27.971 --> 27:31.440
You know, it's okay,
you don't have to do that.

27:31.508 --> 27:33.176
Yeah, I do.

27:36.612 --> 27:38.814
Well, I'm gonna turn in.

27:38.881 --> 27:40.715
You'll take care of the fire?

27:40.783 --> 27:42.150
Yeah, I'll be up for a while.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.690
I should've brought Amy.

27:48.757 --> 27:50.958
Well, why didn't you?

27:51.026 --> 27:53.093
<i>I don't know,</i> <i>I just...</i>

27:53.161 --> 27:54.762
I guess there's a side of me
I didn't want her to see,

27:54.830 --> 27:56.464
so I just took off.

27:58.334 --> 28:01.436
I guess I'm no better
than my dad was.

28:01.503 --> 28:04.605
Did I ever tell you
about my old man?

28:06.541 --> 28:08.975
Was a hell of a hockey player
back in the day.

28:09.043 --> 28:12.412
Even got offered a try-out
with Toronto.

28:12.480 --> 28:14.113
Really, with the Leafs?

28:14.181 --> 28:16.316
No, the St. Patricks...

28:16.384 --> 28:19.586
We're talking way back
in the day.

28:19.654 --> 28:20.554
But he wouldn't leave
the ranch,

28:20.621 --> 28:21.955
said the family needed him.

28:22.889 --> 28:26.992
Truth was...
He needed the comfort of home.

28:27.060 --> 28:29.462
<i>So he stayed</i>
<i>and never took his shot.</i>

28:30.964 --> 28:33.265
And then...

28:33.333 --> 28:35.968
When I decided to head off
on the rodeo circuit,

28:36.035 --> 28:38.036
he nearly hit the roof.

28:39.004 --> 28:40.505
He didn't want you to go?

28:40.573 --> 28:41.773
No.
He thought I was crazy

28:41.841 --> 28:45.076
for chasing some stupid
pipe dream.

28:45.143 --> 28:46.611
And we had it out,

28:46.679 --> 28:48.212
and I jumped in my truck

28:48.280 --> 28:49.581
<i>and ended up at those</i>
<i>same cross roads</i>

28:49.648 --> 28:51.483
<i>I took you to last summer.</i>

28:51.550 --> 28:53.317
Huh.

28:53.386 --> 28:54.585
<i>The world in front of me</i>

28:54.652 --> 28:56.587
<i>looked like a big</i>
<i>scary place...</i>

28:56.654 --> 28:59.423
And I just about turned back.

28:59.491 --> 29:02.058
But I knew I'd end up
just like him,

29:02.126 --> 29:03.761
regretting the risks
I never took,

29:03.828 --> 29:05.796
<i>so I went for it.</i>

29:07.131 --> 29:08.832
All I'm saying, Ty,
is we can't do much

29:08.900 --> 29:12.234
about the mistakes
our father's made,

29:12.302 --> 29:16.939
but we can sure as hell
choose not to repeat them.

29:25.649 --> 29:28.283
We have got to do this
more often.

29:28.350 --> 29:30.619
You know, I actually missed
your stories about Katie.

29:30.686 --> 29:31.920
Oh, don't worry,

29:31.987 --> 29:33.655
I will make it up to you,
I promise.

29:33.723 --> 29:34.856
<i>I'm sure you will.</i>

29:34.957 --> 29:36.892
Hey, can I talk to you
for a sec?

29:36.959 --> 29:38.326
Yeah, I'll go pull
the truck around.

29:38.394 --> 29:40.495
I'll see you later, Soraya.

29:40.563 --> 29:42.630
I feel like a bad person.
Am I a bad person?

29:42.697 --> 29:44.064
What're you talking about?

29:44.132 --> 29:46.066
I think I gave Bryce
the wrong idea

29:46.134 --> 29:48.602
and he asked me out.

29:48.670 --> 29:51.271
I have a feeling
he asks a lot of girls out.

29:51.339 --> 29:53.073
Yeah, but I said no,

29:53.141 --> 29:54.174
and what if he thinks

29:54.242 --> 29:55.843
it's 'cause he's in
a wheelchair?

29:55.911 --> 29:57.812
Well, it's not, right?

29:57.879 --> 29:59.546
No, of course not.

29:59.613 --> 30:03.450
It's because of Dillon,
that guy in London?

30:03.517 --> 30:06.051
Huh?
Are you in love?

30:06.118 --> 30:09.020
You are, aren't you?
I can totally tell.

30:09.088 --> 30:11.022
I just wish you could meet him.

30:11.090 --> 30:12.991
When's he coming to Hudson?

30:13.059 --> 30:14.927
Um...That's actually

30:14.994 --> 30:17.696
what I wanted to talk
to you about.

30:17.764 --> 30:19.698
You know, I didn't wanna do
the long distance thing,

30:19.766 --> 30:22.733
so I kind of made a decision.

30:23.969 --> 30:25.603
Well, Soraya, don't give up

30:25.671 --> 30:26.838
what you have with Dillon

30:26.905 --> 30:28.673
just because he lives
in a different country.

30:28.740 --> 30:30.942
Long distance relationships
are difficult.

30:31.009 --> 30:32.610
They work,
lots of people do them.

30:32.678 --> 30:34.479
Actually, no,
I'm not giving up.

30:34.546 --> 30:36.913
It's...
It's kinda the opposite.

30:36.981 --> 30:38.782
I um...

30:38.850 --> 30:41.551
Next semester,
I'm transferring schools.

30:41.619 --> 30:43.920
I'm moving to London.

30:50.027 --> 30:52.328
So what do you want to do?

30:52.396 --> 30:54.129
We can listen to music
or something?

30:54.197 --> 30:55.430
Sure.

30:55.499 --> 30:58.501
Hey, I actually have
the perfect cd.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.440
Okay, that's my demo! Mm-hmm.

31:05.509 --> 31:08.310
I burned it off the cd
you gave to my dad.

31:08.378 --> 31:09.744
Don't hate me, but this is...

31:09.812 --> 31:11.779
The first time
I actually have listened to it.

31:11.847 --> 31:13.581
Do you mind maybe turning
something else on?

31:13.649 --> 31:14.883
I can't stand
hearing myself sing.

31:14.950 --> 31:16.751
No, I recognize this song.

31:16.819 --> 31:18.252
Yeah.

31:26.928 --> 31:29.963
Maria?
You're waiting on Maria?

31:31.032 --> 31:32.566
Really?
Because I thought you said

31:32.634 --> 31:34.200
you wrote that song for me?

31:34.268 --> 31:35.702
That's what you said, right?

31:35.770 --> 31:37.337
Yeah. Oh!

31:37.405 --> 31:38.471
I can't believe

31:38.540 --> 31:39.873
I almost gave you
a second chance!

31:39.941 --> 31:41.273
Please let me explain this!

31:41.341 --> 31:43.342
As if using me to get to my dad
isn't bad enough,

31:43.410 --> 31:44.944
you make me think
that you wrote a song for me?

31:45.012 --> 31:46.311
C'mon, Mallory,

31:46.379 --> 31:47.647
this is not what
it sounds like, I promise.

31:47.714 --> 31:48.648
And the whole time it's about
this chick named Maria?

31:48.715 --> 31:49.849
Really?

31:50.784 --> 31:53.853
I'm speechless,
and that's weird for me.

31:53.921 --> 31:55.721
Just get out,
and take Maria with you.

31:55.789 --> 31:57.121
Okay, fine. Fine.

31:57.189 --> 31:58.723
I didn't write
the song for you,

31:58.791 --> 32:01.693
but there is no Maria,
I promise.

32:01.761 --> 32:03.461
Wow, you just keep
shovelling it

32:03.529 --> 32:04.462
higher and higher.

32:04.530 --> 32:05.597
It's true.

32:05.665 --> 32:06.665
Look, I just picked
a random name,

32:06.732 --> 32:07.799
I put it in the song,

32:07.867 --> 32:10.268
and then I met you
and I rewrote it,

32:10.335 --> 32:13.236
because you're the girl
I've been waiting for.

32:13.304 --> 32:16.974
So, for me,
this has become your song.

32:17.976 --> 32:20.177
I don't believe you.

32:21.212 --> 32:22.580
It's true.

32:25.116 --> 32:27.785
Really?
Really.

32:29.053 --> 32:31.754
No B.S.?
No B.S.

32:35.192 --> 32:36.192
Oh my God, they're home.

32:36.259 --> 32:37.594
Go. Run!
Okay. Okay.

32:38.662 --> 32:39.696
Quick! Quick!

32:45.301 --> 32:46.702
Hey.

32:46.769 --> 32:47.869
How was your
sisters' night out?

32:47.937 --> 32:50.138
It was fun, it was good.

32:51.173 --> 32:54.676
Uh, why is there popcorn
all over the place?

32:54.744 --> 32:57.345
<i>Sorry. I was watching</i>
<i>a scary movie and...</i>

32:58.447 --> 32:59.781
<i>Ow!</i>

33:00.716 --> 33:03.017
Oh my...

33:03.085 --> 33:04.719
Agh!
Who leaves their boots

33:04.786 --> 33:07.521
laying in the middle
of the porch?

33:07.589 --> 33:08.889
Mallory?!

33:27.945 --> 33:28.979
Jack?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.192
Jack.

33:34.861 --> 33:37.129
Ugh. What time is it?

33:37.196 --> 33:38.830
It's early.

33:38.898 --> 33:40.165
Look, I'm heading up
to this great spot

33:40.233 --> 33:42.568
that overlooks the lake.

33:42.636 --> 33:44.836
Well, I'm heading back
to sleep.

33:44.904 --> 33:47.038
Oh, sure, of course.

33:47.106 --> 33:49.641
Well, I'll see you
when I get back.

33:49.708 --> 33:51.876
Whoa. Whoa, hold up.

33:53.145 --> 33:55.680
It's time for me to do this.

33:55.748 --> 33:57.515
And you want me come?

34:00.152 --> 34:01.519
Okay.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.088
I can't believe
Mallory last night.

34:04.156 --> 34:06.256
I mean, since when
is she so boy crazy?

34:06.324 --> 34:08.190
She's not a little girl
any more, Lou.

34:08.259 --> 34:09.659
Yeah, I know, she's growing up,

34:09.726 --> 34:11.161
and as her role models,

34:11.226 --> 34:13.295
it is our job to teach her
some responsibility.

34:13.364 --> 34:14.697
You know, she knows

34:14.766 --> 34:15.799
I never would've let her
have a boy over

34:15.866 --> 34:17.301
while she was babysitting.

34:17.368 --> 34:19.202
Okay. So what're you
gonna do about it?

34:19.270 --> 34:20.603
I don't know yet,

34:20.672 --> 34:21.904
but she needs to learn
a lesson from this.

34:25.309 --> 34:27.510
What the hell is he doing?

34:30.146 --> 34:31.179
Bryce?

34:31.815 --> 34:33.616
Bryce!
Get out of there, now.

34:33.684 --> 34:35.384
Man, calm down, Amy.

34:35.452 --> 34:36.786
Watch this.

34:36.853 --> 34:38.420
Hey? Come here.
Come on.

34:39.388 --> 34:41.088
It's okay. Hmm?

34:41.156 --> 34:43.958
There, see?
That's a good boy.

34:44.025 --> 34:46.494
<i>I'm not gonna hurt you.</i>

34:47.862 --> 34:50.231
See, that feels nice,
huh, Alcatraz?

34:50.299 --> 34:51.333
See, he's getting used to it.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.500
<i>I don't care.</i>

34:52.568 --> 34:53.667
What if you were
to get hurt out here?

34:53.735 --> 34:55.302
I've had a lawsuit before.

34:55.370 --> 34:56.503
Come on, we've just
been hanging out,

34:56.571 --> 34:57.705
getting to know each other.

34:57.772 --> 34:59.206
Needed some time.

34:59.273 --> 35:00.474
I don't believe you.

35:00.542 --> 35:01.542
If you wanted to work
with Alcatraz,

35:01.609 --> 35:02.909
you should've asked me.

35:02.977 --> 35:04.244
This is my horse.

35:05.213 --> 35:06.179
Come on.

35:13.954 --> 35:15.521
You're lucky he didn't blow up.

35:15.589 --> 35:16.756
He's real gentle with me, okay?

35:16.824 --> 35:18.224
He passed
his first test today...

35:18.291 --> 35:19.592
You need drop it, Bryce.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.227
What is it with you
and this horse?

35:21.294 --> 35:22.829
Look, I just don't think
you wanna give him up.

35:22.896 --> 35:24.430
I'm just being realistic.

35:24.498 --> 35:25.564
He's still got a long way to go

35:25.631 --> 35:27.298
before he's ready
for para-riding.

35:27.367 --> 35:28.767
Yeah, well,
give the guy a break, okay?

35:28.835 --> 35:31.035
I needed a little time too,

35:31.103 --> 35:33.505
but you didn't give up on me.

35:39.144 --> 35:41.445
I know that you're
gonna have boyfriends,

35:41.513 --> 35:44.281
but you were supposed to be
watching Katie last night.

35:44.349 --> 35:45.750
And I was.

35:45.817 --> 35:47.050
How can you watch a baby

35:47.118 --> 35:48.719
when you're making out
with some guy?

35:48.787 --> 35:51.021
We were just listening
to music.

35:51.089 --> 35:52.523
Right. Whatever.

35:52.591 --> 35:53.824
Look, the point is

35:53.892 --> 35:55.959
you need to learn
about responsibility,

35:56.027 --> 35:58.395
and I have to be able
to count on you.

35:58.462 --> 35:59.962
And to tell you the truth,

36:00.030 --> 36:01.964
I'm a bit disappointed in you.

36:02.032 --> 36:03.600
Really?

36:03.667 --> 36:04.701
You're gonna play the whole...

36:04.769 --> 36:07.136
"I'm so disappointed
in you" card?

36:07.204 --> 36:08.805
You're such a hypocrite.

36:08.873 --> 36:09.873
Hypocrite?

36:09.940 --> 36:12.776
What're you talking about?

36:12.843 --> 36:14.643
Think back, Lou.

36:14.711 --> 36:17.846
Think way back to when
you used to babysit me.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.847
Remember?
Yeah... so?

36:19.915 --> 36:23.284
So you used to have Scott over
all the time.

36:23.351 --> 36:25.052
No wonder you got the idea
we were making out.

36:25.120 --> 36:27.488
- I didn't...
- I mean that wasn't...

36:27.556 --> 36:28.656
Okay, look,

36:28.724 --> 36:30.858
that was different because...

36:32.160 --> 36:33.494
You remember that?

36:33.562 --> 36:35.462
Yeah.
Uh, his escape route

36:35.530 --> 36:37.531
was through my bedroom window.

36:46.140 --> 36:47.874
Good boy, Alcatraz.

36:48.843 --> 36:50.677
Good boy.

36:50.745 --> 36:53.345
<i>So these are not gonna</i>
<i>hurt you.</i>

36:54.314 --> 36:55.414
<i>All right?</i>

37:04.190 --> 37:05.424
<i>Give the guy a break, okay?</i>

37:05.492 --> 37:07.492
<i>I needed a little time too,</i>

37:07.560 --> 37:09.894
<i>but you didn't give up on me.</i>

37:26.544 --> 37:28.112
You be a good boy...

37:30.648 --> 37:32.483
Good boy.

37:32.550 --> 37:33.584
You're okay.

37:45.396 --> 37:48.131
It's okay. It's okay.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.532
When I put it on,

37:49.600 --> 37:52.235
it's just a little pressure,
like my leg.

37:53.604 --> 37:54.704
It's okay, it's okay.

37:54.771 --> 37:56.305
Hey, take it easy.

37:57.974 --> 38:00.509
<i>I'll just do it lightly.</i>

38:03.346 --> 38:04.313
There you go.

38:04.381 --> 38:06.897
Good boy.
Good boy.

38:10.020 --> 38:12.220
All right, don't cut in on me.

38:13.188 --> 38:14.288
There you go.

38:15.391 --> 38:17.125
It's okay.

38:18.360 --> 38:19.394
Good boy.

38:20.962 --> 38:21.862
Good boy.

38:28.802 --> 38:32.105
My dad and I hiked up here
the last day of our trip,

38:32.173 --> 38:33.540
just me and him.

38:34.542 --> 38:36.709
<i>He dared me to jump.</i>

38:36.777 --> 38:39.513
That's a pretty good drop.

38:39.580 --> 38:43.083
<i>Yeah, but he said he
did it</i> <i>when he was a kid,</i>

38:43.151 --> 38:45.051
and now it was my turn.

38:45.118 --> 38:46.485
So did you jump?

38:46.553 --> 38:48.087
Yeah.

38:48.155 --> 38:51.190
And I was pretty proud,
and so was he.

38:51.258 --> 38:52.391
And then I get back up here

38:52.459 --> 38:54.527
and he tells me
that he never did it.

38:59.799 --> 39:01.032
You know, for all his faults,

39:01.100 --> 39:05.203
he had a way of making me
believe in myself.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.609
You sure you're okay
with me being here?

39:11.677 --> 39:12.777
Yeah.

39:19.150 --> 39:21.418
<i>You know, I wish I could've</i>
<i>talked to him one last time.</i>

39:24.055 --> 39:25.255
Maybe he could've
made me understand

39:25.323 --> 39:26.890
why he did some of the things
that he did.

39:29.727 --> 39:32.562
Who knows,
maybe I could've forgiven him.

39:32.629 --> 39:35.798
I just wish I had that chance.

39:35.865 --> 39:39.502
<i>Well, maybe he
heard you</i> <i>just now.</i>

39:47.377 --> 39:48.410
Goodbye dad.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.091
<i>You sure you don't want</i>
<i>to stay one more day?</i>

40:10.158 --> 40:11.259
<i>No.</i>

40:11.327 --> 40:13.794
I just wanna get back, see Amy.

40:14.730 --> 40:18.132
I'm sure she can't wait
to see you either.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.468
Hey, Jack,

40:20.536 --> 40:22.502
I want to thank you
for everything,

40:22.570 --> 40:24.338
for being here.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.327
<i>Amy!</i>

40:49.929 --> 40:51.664
To what do I owe the visit?

40:51.732 --> 40:52.965
Well, I've been working
with him,

40:53.032 --> 40:55.833
and he might just have
the makings for this.

40:55.901 --> 40:58.202
But you're gonna have
to take it slow.

40:58.271 --> 40:59.404
I know.

40:59.472 --> 41:01.640
And you have to be patient
with him.

41:01.707 --> 41:03.541
I will.

41:03.609 --> 41:06.544
Okay.
Where do you want him?

41:06.612 --> 41:08.846
Uh, just throw him in
the big pen for now.

41:08.914 --> 41:10.547
Come on, boy.

41:18.590 --> 41:19.890
All right, you,

41:20.825 --> 41:22.493
this is your home now, okay?

41:22.560 --> 41:24.728
Bryce is gonna treat you
real well.

41:24.796 --> 41:26.629
Just so you know,
I'll be around

41:26.697 --> 41:28.665
to see if you're behaving
yourself, okay?

41:28.732 --> 41:30.466
And if you're not,

41:30.534 --> 41:32.502
I'm gonna come back
and kick your butt,

41:32.569 --> 41:33.603
all right?

41:33.671 --> 41:35.705
So you be a good boy.

41:35.773 --> 41:37.407
Good boy...

41:40.511 --> 41:42.711
Okay, so...
I want you to call me

41:42.779 --> 41:44.546
the minute
this doesn't work out.

41:44.614 --> 41:46.548
I will,

41:46.616 --> 41:48.650
but I think we'll be okay.

41:48.718 --> 41:49.718
<i>Thanks.</i>

41:49.786 --> 41:52.754
You just take good care of him.

41:52.822 --> 41:54.823
Oh, and Bryce,
my friend Soraya,

41:54.890 --> 41:58.226
she thinks that
she hurt your feelings.

42:11.573 --> 42:12.773
I know why you
won't hang out with me.

42:12.841 --> 42:13.774
Uh...

42:13.842 --> 42:14.941
I get it.

42:15.008 --> 42:16.643
No. No, you don't.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.546
Um, I have a boyfriend,
in London,

42:19.613 --> 42:20.780
and that's why I'm going back.

42:20.848 --> 42:23.883
It has nothing to do
with your...

42:25.052 --> 42:26.353
With your um...

42:26.420 --> 42:27.354
My wheelchair?

42:27.421 --> 42:29.656
I swear, I swear it's not.

42:29.724 --> 42:31.022
Well, no kidding.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.191
I was gonna say you have
a thing against cowboys.

42:33.259 --> 42:34.893
See, now I know that it's true.

42:34.961 --> 42:36.161
What're you talking about?

42:36.229 --> 42:38.029
You would rather be
with some English dandy

42:38.097 --> 42:39.431
than a guy from your hometown.

42:39.499 --> 42:41.299
Okay, first of all,
he's from Toronto,

42:41.368 --> 42:44.870
and he's no dandy,
whatever that means.

42:44.937 --> 42:47.405
Well,
I'm sure he's a fine chap.

42:47.473 --> 42:49.741
Yes. Yes, he is,
actually.

42:50.709 --> 42:51.743
Good.

42:55.813 --> 42:56.780
There's some
great trails up there.

42:56.848 --> 42:59.282
We should go there sometime.

43:04.021 --> 43:05.355
So Mallory's
looking after Katie

43:05.423 --> 43:06.956
for the whole morning?

43:07.024 --> 43:09.025
Yup. That should be
a good lesson for her.

43:09.093 --> 43:10.526
She loves Katie.

43:10.594 --> 43:11.994
How is that your big lesson?

43:12.061 --> 43:13.228
Are you going soft on me?

43:13.296 --> 43:14.563
No.

43:14.631 --> 43:17.500
It's just Mallory
and her insane memory.

43:17.567 --> 43:18.868
What do you mean?

43:18.935 --> 43:22.872
Nothing. Long, boring story,
trust me.

43:22.939 --> 43:25.274
So how'd it go with Alcatraz?

43:25.341 --> 43:27.074
The drop-off went well...

43:27.142 --> 43:28.376
But I don't know.

43:28.444 --> 43:29.977
I don't know
if it's gonna work out.

43:30.045 --> 43:31.178
Bryce is tough,

43:31.246 --> 43:32.881
but Alcatraz is a lot
to handle.

43:32.948 --> 43:34.148
Hmm.
What?

43:35.317 --> 43:36.250
That's what I thought
when you and Ty

43:36.318 --> 43:38.420
first got together.

43:39.522 --> 43:42.156
Well, I guess I can see
why you were thinking that.

43:42.224 --> 43:44.458
I mean, Ty was this
juvenile delinquent

43:44.526 --> 43:47.761
with a bad attitude
and a motorcycle.

43:47.829 --> 43:49.730
Uh, no, actually.
Other way around;

43:49.798 --> 43:52.300
I thought Ty
couldn't handle you.

43:52.367 --> 43:53.500
As if.

43:53.568 --> 43:55.069
Well, whatever way
you wanna look at it,

43:55.137 --> 43:57.638
you two were a pretty
unlikely match.

43:57.705 --> 43:58.805
Look at you now.

43:58.872 --> 44:00.941
You've provin' us all wrong.

44:11.118 --> 44:12.419
Take that, old man!

44:21.194 --> 44:22.694
Ty, look out!

44:25.365 --> 44:26.932
Ty!
