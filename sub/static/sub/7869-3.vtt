06:48.839 --> 06:50.806

the free safety.

07:20.721 --> 07:22.955

you and your friends
could tell me something

07:46.096 --> 07:47.563
about baseball strategy.

07:47.631 --> 07:49.565
The only thing I
know about strategy is

07:49.633 --> 07:51.300
that whatever the
manager does, it's wrong,

07:51.368 --> 07:54.303
unless it works, in which case
he's a button-pusher.

07:54.371 --> 07:56.672
I hate guys that just
push buttons all day.

07:56.740 --> 07:58.341
You just push
buttons all day.

Obama came in,

08:00.177 --> 08:01.811

08:01.878 --> 08:03.312
Ugh! Does anyone here

08:07.467 --> 08:11.203

08:11.271 --> 08:13.789
As a pitcher, Cliff Lee is
clearly superior

08:13.857 --> 08:15.408
to Zack Greinke.

08:15.475 --> 08:17.059
Uh, yes, I completely agree,

08:17.127 --> 08:20.263
with the following
<i>colossal</i> exception.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.682
Before the fourth inning
after a road loss

08:22.749 --> 08:24.634
in a domed stadium.

08:24.701 --> 08:26.602
Th it's good to be Greinke.

08:26.670 --> 08:28.387
Uh, unless he's got a bunion,

08:28.455 --> 08:31.123
in which case he is notably
ineffective. (chuckles)

08:31.191 --> 08:35.394
Wow. I'm surprised you guys know
so much about a sport.

08:35.462 --> 08:38.464
Oh, Lisa, baseball is a game

by the Poin-dexterous.

08:41.635 --> 08:44.387
(chuckling) If you understand
what I've laid out there.

08:44.454 --> 08:47.039
The key to understanding
the game is sabermetrics.

08:47.107 --> 08:48.374
Huh?!

08:48.442 --> 08:52.111
The field was developed
by statistician Bill James.

08:52.179 --> 08:55.982
I made baseball as much fun
as doing your taxes!

08:56.049 --> 08:57.683
Using sabermetrics,

08:57.751 --> 08:59.885
even an eight-year-old girl
can run a ball club

08:59.953 --> 09:01.921

of a Stengel,

09:01.989 --> 09:04.573

of a Steinbrenner.

09:04.641 --> 09:07.410

factor for ginger beer?

09:26.463 --> 09:29.065
Refreshingness
over effervescence.

09:29.132 --> 09:30.766
Plus or minus tang.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.835
Oh, why did I advertise
my drink specials

09:32.903 --> 09:34.837

09:34.905 --> 09:36.505

three reasons.

you...

11:19.142 --> 11:21.177
Bart's father's name is,
you guessed it,

11:21.244 --> 11:22.978
not on my fact sheet.

11:23.046 --> 11:26.715
Bart, this guy's walked
the last two batters,

11:26.783 --> 11:28.751
and if he walks you,
we win the game.

11:28.819 --> 11:30.119
Don't swing at anything!

11:30.187 --> 11:31.387
But I'm on a hot streak.

11:33.039 --> 11:35.307
Hot streaks are
a statistical illusion.

11:35.375 --> 11:37.560
I wish you were a
statistical illusion.

11:37.627 --> 11:40.079
Well, there's a 97 %
chance I'm not,

11:40.147 --> 11:42.114
so do what I say.

11:42.182 --> 11:43.399
(grumbling)

11:46.937 --> 11:49.171
Ball one!

11:51.458 --> 11:52.725
Ball two!

11:52.793 --> 11:54.593
Don't swing.

11:56.279 --> 11:58.314
I've ruined your favorite thing!

11:58.381 --> 12:00.165
Oh...
(grunts)

12:00.217 --> 12:02.017
(crowd cheering)

12:17.467 --> 12:19.351
Team:
Bart! Bart! Bart!

12:19.402 --> 12:21.487
You disobeyed
your manager!

12:21.555 --> 12:23.122
So what?
We won.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.291
Team:
Bart! Bart! Bart!

12:25.358 --> 12:27.760
Here's what: you're
off the team!

12:27.828 --> 12:30.162
Get him out
of here, boys.

12:30.230 --> 12:33.566
Team:
Conflicted,
conflicted, conflicted.

12:37.972 --> 12:38.605
(Agnes mutters)

12:46.918 --> 12:48.419
Come on, guys.

12:48.462 --> 12:49.929
I had to get rid of Bart.

12:49.997 --> 12:52.164
But he socked a
walk-off dinger.

12:52.232 --> 12:54.066
That dinger was a fluke.

12:54.134 --> 12:56.002
Not that I have
to defend myself to you.

12:56.069 --> 12:58.437
Managers manage,
and players play.

12:58.505 --> 13:00.089
Do alligators
alligate?

13:00.157 --> 13:01.324
I don't know... yes!

13:01.391 --> 13:02.358
I'm scared.

13:05.779 --> 13:07.196
Here's my uniform,

13:07.264 --> 13:08.447
(grunts)

13:08.515 --> 13:09.966
since I won't be
needing it anymore.

13:10.033 --> 13:11.117
Whoo-hoo!

13:11.184 --> 13:12.568
Underpants dinner!
(grunts)

13:12.636 --> 13:13.920
No, it's not.

13:13.987 --> 13:14.987
Aww.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.455
You know, Lis,

13:16.523 --> 13:18.190
I'm glad I'm not
playing baseball anymore.

13:18.258 --> 13:20.593
I think I'm more
interested in soccer.

13:20.661 --> 13:21.494
(thudding loudly)
Ow!

13:21.562 --> 13:25.848
(loud thudding, grunting)

13:25.916 --> 13:27.149
Hey. Cut it out!

13:27.217 --> 13:28.734
You're upsetting
the gravy boat.

13:28.802 --> 13:30.953
I'll put a stop
to this nonsense.

13:33.523 --> 13:36.492
Lisa, can't you let your
brother back on the team?

13:36.560 --> 13:41.314
Fly balls and fungoes come and
go, but family is forever.

13:41.381 --> 13:43.549
Sorry Marge, I got
to call bullcrap on that.

13:43.617 --> 13:46.852
The '69 Mets will live on
forever, but do you think

13:46.920 --> 13:49.355
anyone cares about Ron Swoboda's
wife and kids?

13:49.423 --> 13:52.375
Not me, and, I assume,
not Ron Swoboda!

13:52.442 --> 13:54.477
What about
Bart's feelings?

13:54.544 --> 13:56.579
Boys don't have feelings.
They have muscles.

13:56.647 --> 13:59.282
Why do you say
such ridiculous things?

13:59.349 --> 14:01.350
They sound good in my brain,

14:01.418 --> 14:06.155
then my tongue makes not the
words sound very good, formally.

14:06.223 --> 14:09.792
(grunting)

14:09.860 --> 14:12.228
(snoring)

14:12.296 --> 14:14.630
(grunting)

14:16.333 --> 14:18.084
"Mama Bear said,

14:18.151 --> 14:20.953
'I'm sure Sister Bear
will come to her senses.'"

14:21.021 --> 14:24.924
"Then Pete Rose plowed into
his friend Ray Fosse..."

14:24.992 --> 14:28.661
(Marge continues)
"...dislocating Fosse's shoulder
in a meaningless game."

14:28.729 --> 14:31.998
(shouting): "He had earned the
nickname 'Charlie Hustle'..."

14:32.065 --> 14:33.499
(Homer shouting)
"Mama Bear said,

14:33.567 --> 14:36.268
'Families should stick together
because...'"

14:36.336 --> 14:37.837
"...personal feelings get
between him and home plate!"

14:37.904 --> 14:39.038
"'...anything
else is unbearable!'"

14:39.106 --> 14:40.640
Flanders:
Excuse me?

14:40.707 --> 14:42.008
With all this racket,

14:42.075 --> 14:44.443
my boys can't get
their 16 hours sleep.

14:44.511 --> 14:46.195
(both muttering)

14:46.279 --> 14:48.114
(organ playing "Charge")

14:48.181 --> 14:50.349
So, because of your
on-base percentage, Nelson,

14:50.417 --> 14:52.435
you're the new leadoff
hitter. Questions?

14:52.502 --> 14:54.086
When's Bart
coming back?

14:54.154 --> 14:55.488
He's not.
He thought he was better

14:55.555 --> 14:57.423
than the laws of probability.

14:57.491 --> 14:59.992
Anyone else think he's better
than the laws of probability?

15:02.346 --> 15:04.246
Well, you're not!

15:04.331 --> 15:07.466
With me here in the booth is
brand-new color commentator

15:07.534 --> 15:10.386
and former Isotots
great, Bart Simpson.

15:10.454 --> 15:12.054
Bart, do you
miss the game?

15:12.122 --> 15:13.622
No, no, no, no.

15:13.690 --> 15:15.091
I got a lot goin' on.

15:15.158 --> 15:17.193
I'm sure you do.

15:17.260 --> 15:21.597
Milhouse hits a frozen rope
just past the diving shortstop.

15:21.665 --> 15:23.032
There's a play
at the plate!

15:23.100 --> 15:24.633
He's... safe.

15:24.701 --> 15:26.902
And that's all
she wrote.

15:26.970 --> 15:28.871
It's a triumph of
number-crunching

15:28.939 --> 15:30.172
over the human spirit.

15:30.240 --> 15:32.041
And it's about time.

15:32.109 --> 15:35.010
(cheering)

15:35.078 --> 15:36.946
(Lisa squeals)

15:50.043 --> 15:50.843
Look, Dad.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.696
"Players and
Coaches Entrance."

15:52.764 --> 15:54.765
Hey, let's hold hands
and skip inside.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.401
(both laughing)

15:57.452 --> 15:59.837
Well, let's go
to the bleachers.

15:59.904 --> 16:02.072
I brought an air horn
and a megaphone.

16:02.123 --> 16:03.240
Testing...

16:03.291 --> 16:04.258
(horn blows)

16:05.760 --> 16:07.577
Actually, I'm taking you

16:07.629 --> 16:11.015
on a "special little guy
super happy fun" day.

16:11.082 --> 16:12.683
Are you taking me
to the dentist?

16:12.750 --> 16:15.402
You're not going
to the dentist.

16:15.470 --> 16:16.720
(Marge mutters)

16:18.657 --> 16:21.358
You know, Mom, after only seven
hours in this amusement park,

16:21.426 --> 16:23.093
I'm finally
enjoying myself.

16:23.144 --> 16:24.761
I'm actually starting
to forget about...

16:24.813 --> 16:26.046
(cell phone rings)

16:26.114 --> 16:27.898
Lisa?

16:27.966 --> 16:29.199
She wants to
talk to you.

16:29.267 --> 16:30.284
Hey Lis.

16:30.368 --> 16:31.819
Bart, I need you.

16:31.903 --> 16:34.455
Ralph can't play,
'cause he's too juiced.

16:34.522 --> 16:38.676
I didn't know what I was putting
into my body.

16:39.944 --> 16:41.495
Sorry, sis.
I've moved on.

16:41.579 --> 16:44.214
And my days of listening
to my manager are over.

16:44.282 --> 16:45.782
Son, you should always listen
to your manager.

16:45.834 --> 16:46.884
(gasps)

16:46.951 --> 16:48.669
Mike Scioscia!

16:48.753 --> 16:50.504
Didn't you get
radiation poisoning

16:50.588 --> 16:52.639
working at the
Springfield Nuclear Plant?

16:52.724 --> 16:54.007
I sure did,

16:54.092 --> 16:55.843
and it gave me
super-managing powers!

16:55.927 --> 16:57.845
I also demagnetize
credit cards.

16:57.929 --> 16:58.896
(shudders)

16:58.963 --> 17:01.565
Bart, I have
two pieces of advice.

17:01.632 --> 17:03.734
First, keep your arms
in the damn car.

17:03.801 --> 17:05.152
Whoa!

17:05.236 --> 17:07.804
Secondly, I don't care if
your manager is your sister,

17:07.856 --> 17:11.308
Dick Drago's mustache,
or Oscar Gamble's afro.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.243
A player should always listen
to his skipper.

17:13.311 --> 17:15.579
That's how I got these three
World Series rings.

17:15.646 --> 17:17.998
(gasping and shuddering)

17:18.083 --> 17:19.666
Never mind that.
I'll win more.

17:19.751 --> 17:21.251
But you owe it to your sister,

17:21.319 --> 17:23.203
and the great game of baseball--

17:23.288 --> 17:24.821
wacky face for the camera--

17:24.873 --> 17:28.041
to go back
and help your team.

17:28.109 --> 17:29.576
Now, who wants
funnel cake?

17:29.644 --> 17:32.012
You got some great
raw ingredients, kid.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.330
Open up your
stance a little.

17:33.398 --> 17:36.717
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.051
That's okay.

17:38.136 --> 17:40.087
You just didn't
have it today.

17:40.155 --> 17:42.039
Not everything's
baseball.

17:42.107 --> 17:43.474
Yes, it is.

17:43.541 --> 17:45.943
(typing)

17:46.010 --> 17:48.612
Oh! What am I gonna do?

17:48.679 --> 17:50.647
I need a pinch-runner
with speed!

17:50.715 --> 17:53.000
How about a benchwarmer
who's afraid of puppets?

17:53.067 --> 17:54.168
(groans)

17:54.235 --> 17:56.537
Did someone order
a happy ending?

17:56.604 --> 17:57.738
Bart!

17:57.806 --> 17:59.406
Oh!

17:59.474 --> 18:03.444
Now get out there
and kick a field goal!

18:03.511 --> 18:06.113
(chuckles)
Kidding.

18:06.181 --> 18:08.682
Announcer: And that's why anyone
who invested with Lenny Dykstra

18:08.750 --> 18:10.517
really should call that number.

18:10.585 --> 18:11.985
Lawyers are standing by.

18:12.053 --> 18:14.588
Simpson on first,
taking a big lead.

18:14.656 --> 18:17.057
Oh, looks like he's
gonna swipe the bag.

18:17.125 --> 18:18.559
No, no.

18:18.626 --> 18:20.260
Don't steal.

18:29.737 --> 18:30.771
(crowd cheering)

18:30.839 --> 18:32.022
Announcer:
And there he goes!

18:40.331 --> 18:42.766
He's stealing third.

18:42.834 --> 18:45.536
Okay, okay, he's stolen third.

18:45.603 --> 18:47.771
But surely, that's the limit
of his cockiness.

18:47.839 --> 18:50.174
I'm stealing home!

18:50.241 --> 18:54.728
No! The computer says
it's statistically impossible!

18:54.796 --> 18:56.196
Bah.
Computers.

18:56.264 --> 18:58.415
They'll never replace my
Huffnagle autocollator!

18:58.483 --> 19:00.117
Crank it, Smithers.
Crank it!

19:00.185 --> 19:01.952
It's, uh, seizing up, sir.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.154
Yes, well apply
more goose grease.

19:04.222 --> 19:06.440
(cheering)

19:06.508 --> 19:09.926
Stealing home.
It's so impossible.

19:09.978 --> 19:12.279
It's against every
sensible instinct.

19:12.363 --> 19:13.614
It's, it's...

19:18.019 --> 19:19.086
(crowd cheering)

19:19.153 --> 19:20.988
(autocollator shattering)

19:21.055 --> 19:24.157
It's the most exciting
play in baseball.

19:24.242 --> 19:26.460
Go, Bart!

19:28.229 --> 19:30.380
If he makes it,
that's my son!

19:37.288 --> 19:39.623
You're out!
(crowd gasping)

19:39.691 --> 19:42.459
The Isotots lose.

19:42.527 --> 19:46.580
Now to begin my off-season
job: follow-home robberies.

19:46.648 --> 19:48.215
I'll see you in
the parking lot,

19:48.283 --> 19:51.902
but you won't see me
until it's too late.

19:51.970 --> 19:54.538
Homer:
You stink!
(grunts)

19:57.208 --> 19:58.275
Did I make it?

19:58.343 --> 19:59.426
No.

19:59.494 --> 20:00.911
But you did
do something.

20:00.978 --> 20:03.080
You made me
love baseball.

20:03.147 --> 20:05.365
Not as a collection
of numbers,

20:05.450 --> 20:08.252
but as an unpredictable,
passionate game

20:08.319 --> 20:11.672
beaten in excitement only
by every other sport.

20:11.756 --> 20:13.924
I guess your
computer was right.

20:13.992 --> 20:16.894
Maybe it was, but according
to my calculations,

20:16.961 --> 20:20.230
you're a great brother
51 % of the time.

20:20.298 --> 20:23.300
And according
to my gut, you're okay, too.

20:23.368 --> 20:24.601
Can you put a number on it?

20:27.939 --> 20:30.524
Aww...

20:32.894 --> 20:36.413
Team:
Conflict resolved.
Conflict resolved.

20:36.481 --> 20:38.198
<i>Conflict resolved.</i>
