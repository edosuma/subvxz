00:11.133 --> 00:12.933
-* Whatcha want,

00:12.967 --> 00:15.033

00:15.067 --> 00:18.900

-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.933 --> 00:21.000
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.033 --> 00:23.500
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.533 --> 00:25.933
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:25.967 --> 00:27.800
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.833 --> 00:29.200
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.233 --> 00:30.433
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.467 --> 00:32.333
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.367 --> 00:34.400
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.433 --> 00:36.500
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.533 --> 00:39.067
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.100 --> 00:41.000
in a court of law.

00:43.067 --> 00:45.333
-I'm part of a plainclothes,
uh, detective unit

00:45.367 --> 00:47.967
out in Nye County.
I've been a cop
for about six years.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.933
Um, primarily go, and, uh,
hunt active wanted people,

00:51.967 --> 00:55.433
um, narcotics suppression
and, uh, firearms,
violent crime.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.833
One of my partners
has called out a pursuit
right now.

00:58.867 --> 01:00.833
-We're gonna be
en route to that.
-(siren wailing)

01:00.867 --> 01:04.433
Um... looks like the guy's going
about 100 miles an hour,

01:04.467 --> 01:09.600
so we're gonna, uh...
be en route to him
to assist him.

01:09.633 --> 01:11.400
Try to take this guy
into custody.

01:11.433 --> 01:15.067
He's flyin' through town now,
and he's, uh, weavin' in and out
of traffic.

01:15.067 --> 01:16.433
So this is definitely
a safety issue.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.667
He's probably drunk
or a wanted felon or something.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.533
So we need to get this guy
off the street.

01:20.567 --> 01:22.967
-(sirens wailing)

01:23.067 --> 01:24.700
-All right.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.800
-Man (over radio):
See the broken pipe?
He's right there.

01:30.067 --> 01:33.167
-(over radio): Southbound...
-All right,
we're in the pursuit.

01:36.367 --> 01:39.567
They're, uh, settin' up
to, uh, deploy Stop Sticks.

01:39.600 --> 01:43.300
But we're, uh, we're gonna go
and-- and make sure this guy

01:43.333 --> 01:45.167
doesn't get around
the Stop Sticks.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.600
It's dependent
on the way he drives.

01:46.633 --> 01:50.800
-(radio chatter)
-(sirens wailing)

01:50.833 --> 01:55.300
-Man (on radio):
Southbound, comin' to Mesquite.
Speeds of 60.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.233
He's slowin' down.

01:57.267 --> 02:01.200
-Man 2 (on radio): 10-8, copy.
Southbound, passing Mesquite.
Slowing down to speeds of 60.

02:01.233 --> 02:02.967
-Man (on radio):
Oh, he finally stopped.
Nope. Or not.

02:03.067 --> 02:04.967
Never mind.
We're keeping it southbound.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.733
-Man 2 (on radio): 10-8, copy.
Continuing southbound.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.633
-All right, we're second car.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.067
-Man (on radio):
He's in a pickup truck,
but I want permission

02:12.100 --> 02:15.367
for a PIT if I can get him
under 30.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.600
-We'll, we're either gonna
Stop Stick him or we're gonna
PIT him

02:17.633 --> 02:19.967
if he goes down slow enough.

02:20.067 --> 02:22.933
-(sirens wailing)
-(radio chatter)

02:22.967 --> 02:25.500
-Tell 'em he stopped.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.500
-(sirens continuing)

02:30.200 --> 02:32.500
-Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

02:32.533 --> 02:33.900
Get on the ground!

02:33.933 --> 02:35.533
-(indistinct shouting)

02:37.567 --> 02:40.067
-Back up. Come on.
-Relax! Relax! Relax!

02:40.067 --> 02:41.900
Relax! I got it!

02:41.933 --> 02:44.433
Let-- Let-- Let me
have some air.
There we go.

02:44.467 --> 02:47.367
Give me another one.
To the side!
To the side!

02:47.400 --> 02:49.533
-Dogs!
-Dogs!

02:49.567 --> 02:50.733
-Dogs!

02:50.767 --> 02:52.333
-Somebody call animal control.

02:52.367 --> 02:53.800
-All right, stand up.

02:53.833 --> 02:56.067
-(radio chatter)

02:56.100 --> 02:58.433
-Stand up. Ready?
-Mm-hmm.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.300
-I know. I know--

03:02.333 --> 03:04.433
Hi, I'm Detective Cox.
-I know. I know.

03:04.467 --> 03:05.467
-What is your deal?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.633
-I'm going through depression.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.267
-Okay. Depression?
-Yeah.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.467
-So you wanna
get people killed?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.467
-No.
-Well, that's what you
just tried to do.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.333
-I'm sorry, man, I wasn't--
-So you run like that?

03:14.367 --> 03:16.533
-I pulled him over on--
-What's up, partner?
Tell me what's up.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.467
-I pulled him over
on Highway 160.
-Okay.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.500
-Had fictitious plates on it.

03:21.533 --> 03:22.867
Told him to get out.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.133
Once I told him to get out,
he put it in drive and took off.

03:25.167 --> 03:26.833
Been chasin' him since.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.700
-Great job.
Way to call it out.

03:28.733 --> 03:30.467
Way to call it out.

03:32.300 --> 03:33.600
All right, why'd you run?

03:36.167 --> 03:38.233
Why'd you run?

03:38.267 --> 03:41.133
-Do you know how many people
you put in danger, dude?

03:41.167 --> 03:43.267
-Look at this.
Look around.

03:44.633 --> 03:46.600
It's the middle of the day.

03:46.633 --> 03:49.467
And you're drivin'
100 miles an hour,

03:49.500 --> 03:52.533
down 160, where all these--
-Did you wanna go to jail?

03:52.567 --> 03:54.067
Was that your plan?

03:54.100 --> 03:56.067
Why not just pull over
and stop?

03:56.067 --> 03:58.700
You put everybody
in this community
in danger, dude.

03:58.733 --> 04:00.400
That's pretty frickin' stupid.

04:00.433 --> 04:01.533
Don't you think?
-Yeah.

04:01.567 --> 04:05.067
-I got cop cars damaged
because of what you did.

04:05.067 --> 04:06.667
You're gonna be responsible
for that.

04:08.067 --> 04:10.267
And your dogs
are going to impound.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.733
-How much have you had
to drink?

04:11.767 --> 04:13.767
-I don't drink.
-How much have you had
to drink?

04:13.800 --> 04:15.333
I can smell the beer on you.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.200
How much have you had?

04:19.133 --> 04:21.067
Here, have a seat
for me, buddy.

04:21.100 --> 04:25.233
-Hey, that's-- that's
what happens when someone
breaks your heart in two.

04:25.267 --> 04:26.933
-What happened?
Someone broke your heart?

04:26.967 --> 04:29.433
-Yeah.
-You havin' girl problems,
for real?

04:29.467 --> 04:32.500
Hey, man, I'm divorced, too.
I get it. Trust me.

04:32.533 --> 04:36.200
Sometimes women can be crazy
and make us do crazy things,
don't you think?

04:36.233 --> 04:39.100
-Definitely.
-But, hey, your life's worth it.

04:39.133 --> 04:42.767
Seriously.
Your life's worth it,
and, dude, don't you think

04:42.800 --> 04:44.167
what you did today
is kinda reckless?

04:44.200 --> 04:46.367
-It was stupid.
-It was stupid, right?

04:46.400 --> 04:48.133
How old are you?
-I'm 31, sir.

04:48.167 --> 04:51.500
-Dude, you're 31.
You've got your whole life
to live.

04:51.533 --> 04:53.867
You don't wanna die--
You got kids?
-No, I don't have kids.

04:53.900 --> 04:56.233
-No kids, but you're 31, man.

04:56.267 --> 04:58.067
You got your whole life
to live ahead of you.

04:58.067 --> 05:00.433
You got everything
goin' for you, you know?

05:00.467 --> 05:01.867
This isn't the way.

05:01.900 --> 05:03.800
-Yes, sir.
-Is that car stolen?

05:03.833 --> 05:05.967
-No, it's my car.
-It's your car? Okay.

05:06.067 --> 05:09.433
-I just... That's all--
That's all I think I got.

05:09.467 --> 05:12.333
-She took everything?
I know how that is, man.

05:12.367 --> 05:14.633
I left with a couple T-shirts.

05:14.667 --> 05:18.200
And my two puppies, man. I--
-And your two puppies?

05:18.233 --> 05:20.900
Well, dude, you could've
killed them, too, man, you know?

05:20.933 --> 05:24.067
And I'm glad you gave up.
I'm glad you stopped.
You know, that's smart.

05:24.067 --> 05:26.800
Because, look what--
you were headed into town

05:26.833 --> 05:29.267
where a bunch of kids
are gettin' dropped off
for school right now.

05:29.300 --> 05:31.400
-That's my stop.
-It's a bus stop
right up there.

05:31.433 --> 05:34.067
You know, if you would've
smashed those kids with us
goin' through,

05:34.100 --> 05:35.867
that would've been a nightmare.

05:35.900 --> 05:38.933
Hey, I'm gonna pull you out.
I want you to get checked out
by the medics, okay?

05:38.967 --> 05:41.100
-It's not bad, but...
-I just want you to get
checked out,

05:41.133 --> 05:42.900
make sure you're okay.

05:42.933 --> 05:45.433
You're okay gettin' out.
Can you get out?

05:45.467 --> 05:48.167
Let me help you out.
Watch your head.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.400
-Come on out, man.

05:49.433 --> 05:51.667
There you go.
-You okay?

05:51.700 --> 05:53.267
All right, this is
the fire department.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.333
-Hey, man!

05:55.567 --> 05:57.633
-So, these are his puppies.

05:57.667 --> 06:00.600
Like he said, he left
with, uh, the only--
the only things

06:00.633 --> 06:04.133
he had left from his ex-wife
are these puppies and his truck.

06:04.167 --> 06:07.500
Um, the truck's cold-plated,
so, we're gonna run the VIN

06:07.533 --> 06:09.167
right now and see
if it's stolen.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.200
And, uh, we're gonna
conduct a records check on him

06:11.233 --> 06:12.533
and see where he's at.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.967
So, you're havin'
marital problems, right?

06:16.067 --> 06:19.067
-Yes, sir.
-Why, um--
What happened?

06:21.100 --> 06:22.500
-She cheated on me.

06:22.533 --> 06:24.333
-So she cheated on you
and you left?

06:24.367 --> 06:25.500
Okay.

06:26.967 --> 06:30.967
-And I had a couple beers.
Somehow got pulled over.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.700
-And then you were--
Were you pissed off
about your wife,

06:34.733 --> 06:36.433
that's why
you didn't stop?

06:36.467 --> 06:38.900
-I was pissed off
because I got pulled over,
'cause I couldn't afford plates,

06:38.933 --> 06:40.733
'cause she took everything.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.133
-Just don't run next time, man.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.267
My partner, the guy
that stopped you, Deputy Ramos?
-Yeah?

06:44.300 --> 06:46.200
-He's divorced, too.
You know?

06:46.233 --> 06:49.200
He probably would've felt
for you. He probably wouldn't
even wrote you a ticket.

06:49.233 --> 06:52.300
We went from a ticket
to takin' a trip to jail today,
you know what I mean?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.300
-Yes, sir.
-We could've avoided
all of this, don't you think?

06:54.333 --> 06:56.867
-Something stupid I did.
-Hey, we learn from it,
though, right?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.267
-Yeah.
-Just move on.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.667
-Move on.
-Hey, there's always other fish
in the sea, right?

07:03.067 --> 07:06.333
-I started out watching "Cops"
when I was really young
with my grandpa.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.767
I remember goin' to their house
and "Cops" would come on
at night,

07:08.800 --> 07:10.400
and we ended up watching it,

07:10.433 --> 07:12.167
and it just-- it was something
that really struck me.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.567
I really liked
watching the officers,

07:13.600 --> 07:14.967
what they stood for,
what they were doing,

07:15.067 --> 07:16.300
the kind of work
that they were doing.

07:16.333 --> 07:17.400
It just kind of
became a calling.

07:17.433 --> 07:18.700
It was something I always
wanted to do,

07:18.733 --> 07:21.300
and, kind of as I grew up,
this is something I pursued

07:21.333 --> 07:25.867
and finally got to--
got my opportunity
to do it, here in Stockton.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.500
-(radio chatter)

07:29.100 --> 07:30.967
-(siren chirps)

07:31.067 --> 07:32.600
-So we'll stop this guy
right there.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.600
He's got his, uh--
right brake light's out.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.167
-Got it?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.167
Watch yourself.
Hold on, hold on.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.300
-Adams and El Dorado, six.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.433
Hey, how you doin' buddy?
-I'm good.

07:48.467 --> 07:51.067
Good, you got your license,
insurance, registration
with you, man?

07:53.833 --> 07:55.900
-My ID, it's probably not on me.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.400
-You don't have any ID
on you at all?

07:57.433 --> 07:59.533
-No. Well, you know what?
I was just comin' from
the house, so.

07:59.567 --> 08:01.767
-All right. Are you on
probation, parole, PRC,
anything like that?

08:01.800 --> 08:03.067
-No, man,
none of that (bleep).
-Okay.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.633
-All right, here's what
we'll have you do, buddy.

08:04.667 --> 08:06.133
Go ahead and step out
of the car for me, man.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.633
-Aw, man, you guys
gotta search it all?
-Yeah.

08:07.667 --> 08:09.600
-Why, man?
-Why? 'Cause you don't
have any ID on you, buddy.

08:09.633 --> 08:11.267
-But I got-- Hold on,
I got my ID, relax.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.933
-Okay, where's your ID at?
-Hold on there.

08:13.967 --> 08:18.067
-That is crazy, bro.
Officer, this is--- this is--
this is ridiculous, man.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.900
You guys gotta give me a break
on this one, 'cause I--

08:20.933 --> 08:23.667
-You got your ID or not?
-Man... Hey, come on, man.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.833
-Okay, bud, come on out.
-Why you guys gotta
arrest me for?

08:25.867 --> 08:28.500
-Go ahead and step out.
You're not bein' arrested.
Step out, turn and face me.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.500
-Oh my God, man.
-Just put your hands
behind your back, bud.

08:30.533 --> 08:32.500
You're not under arrest,
but you are being detained.

08:32.533 --> 08:34.467
-I'm bein' stopped,
but for what?
-'Cause your light's out.

08:34.500 --> 08:35.600
Come over here.
-What light's out?

08:35.633 --> 08:37.067
-We'll show you.
Come over here.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.100
Do you have anything
in the car we need to be
concerned about?

08:39.133 --> 08:41.500
-Nothin' illegal in the car?
-As far as what, though, man?

08:41.533 --> 08:42.900
-Anything illegal.
-This is crazy, bro.

08:42.933 --> 08:45.133
Oh, heck no, sir.
-And stop.

08:45.167 --> 08:48.567
Come on, man. I just
goin' home, man. I just
putting gas on the car.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.733
This is (bleep) ridiculous, sir.

08:50.767 --> 08:55.533
-(indistinct) I'm clean, man.
I ain't on probation, on parole
or nothin', man.

08:55.567 --> 08:58.867
But you guys (bleep)...
-Why are you gettin'
so jacked up right now, man?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.767
-Why are you guys
doin' this on me?
-You're driving a motor vehicle

09:01.800 --> 09:03.400
without any kind of ID
or license.

09:03.433 --> 09:05.400
-Officer, I just (bleep)
left my (bleep) house...

09:05.433 --> 09:08.100
-It's illegal.
-I understand it, but I just
left my house to go

09:08.133 --> 09:09.633
put my mama's rent in, man.

09:09.667 --> 09:12.067
-Okay.
-I ain't on probation,
and you guys just wanna

09:12.067 --> 09:14.533
search that--
This is crazy, dude.

09:14.567 --> 09:17.733
-Have a seat.
-I just (bleep) happened
to (bleep) leave my house.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.333
-Kick your feet out.

09:19.367 --> 09:20.767
There you go.
Stay just like that, okay?

09:20.800 --> 09:23.400
-But, Officer--
Man, this is not right,
though, man.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.733
-I understand,
but you understand
what's goin' on, right?

09:25.767 --> 09:28.333
-I got to pick up my son, dude,
I gotta pick him up
at the school program.

09:28.367 --> 09:30.700
-Okay. It'll be all right.
-I got custody
of my son, sir.

09:30.733 --> 09:33.533
-Okay.
-I'm raisin' him since
he was three years old, man.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.800
This type of (bleep) right here
is just stalling me the (bleep),

09:35.833 --> 09:38.300
and I'm not doin'
nothin' wrong--
-Okay. Well, just sit there

09:38.333 --> 09:40.400
and relax, it'll be okay.
-I just wanna go home.

09:40.433 --> 09:41.800
-Huh? All right?

09:41.833 --> 09:44.300
-I just wanna go home, man.

09:44.333 --> 09:47.700
This is ridiculous.
I'm getting-- I-I--
for no reason, bro.

09:47.733 --> 09:50.067
-So right now we're just
checking the car to see
if he's got his license

09:50.100 --> 09:51.433
or any kind of ID with him.

09:51.467 --> 09:54.733
-Nephew there, bro!
(stammering)

09:54.767 --> 09:57.467
-We have a...
have a revolver here.

09:57.500 --> 10:01.667
-That's my nephew's, dude.
Tell him! Hey bro. He was
in my car earlier, bud.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.100
-We're gonna leave that here
and have FEP come
and photograph it.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.167
-(bleep)...not even mine!
(bleeping)
-Okay.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.933
-(bleep)... go, man! No, no!

10:09.967 --> 10:12.533
-My son! Oh, my baby!
-Got a unit coming.

10:12.567 --> 10:16.000
-Oh, my baby! Lord,
this ain't happenin'
to me, man!

10:16.033 --> 10:17.333
-Let's just stay there
and be calm, bud.

10:17.367 --> 10:21.400
-Dude, just be calm?
(indistinct) be calm?

10:21.433 --> 10:22.833
-(man whimpering)

10:22.867 --> 10:24.833
-All right, just stay calm.
We'll get you taken care of.

10:24.867 --> 10:26.900
-No, man!
I can't go to jail, man!

10:26.933 --> 10:29.467
-All right.
Have a seat, bud.
-(radio chatter)

10:29.500 --> 10:32.333
-Oh, hell...
-Have a seat.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.267
Sit down.
-I didn't even
talk to my mom.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.133
(sobbing) My mom!
-Put your foot in.
Put your foot in.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.167
-Please don't leave me here...
-Hey, put your foot
in the car.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.100
-I understand, but
don't leave me here...
-Put your foot in the car.

10:42.133 --> 10:45.633
Put your foot in the car.
-I have my son,
my baby boy!

10:45.667 --> 10:48.400
-Let me get these off you
for a minute.
All right.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.267
We'll be right back
with you, hang tight
for a second.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.433
-Come on, man!
-Watch your foot.

10:55.133 --> 10:57.800
You need to take a picture
of it fully loaded?
-Yeah.

10:59.167 --> 11:01.600
And it's gonna have
six rounds in it.

11:03.633 --> 11:06.567
And she's just photographing
all the serial numbers
and stuff.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.133
So, inside the bag
where the gun was at,

11:10.167 --> 11:15.533
looks like our driver's
driver's license
with his ID card

11:15.567 --> 11:17.533
is sittin' in there.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.867
So right now, we're just
gonna run the serial number
of the firearm.

11:19.900 --> 11:21.067
See if it's stolen or not.

11:21.067 --> 11:24.633
-Looks like
it comes back as stolen.
-Okay.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.400
-September of last year.
-September of last year?

11:27.433 --> 11:28.733
Okay.

11:31.433 --> 11:33.867
Okay, Francisco,
can you hear me okay, man?
-Yeah.

11:33.900 --> 11:35.167
-Okay, what's goin' on
with the gun?

11:35.200 --> 11:36.600
Why was the gun
in your car, bud?

11:36.633 --> 11:38.833
-To tell you the truth
the gun was-- the gun
did not start off

11:38.867 --> 11:40.567
nowhere in there.
There was nowhere--

11:40.600 --> 11:43.167
-Hey, can you do me a favor?
Just talk to me, I can't
hear you over my radio.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.333
-What I'm sayin' is I get up
every (bleep) morning, man,

11:45.367 --> 11:47.667
like, and take my kid to school.
-Okay.

11:47.700 --> 11:50.067
-Get him ready, been the same
damn program, man.

11:50.067 --> 11:53.333
-Okay.
-And, uh, earlier that day,
one of my nephews came by.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.200
-Which day was this?
-This was today.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.600
-Today?
-Everything happened today.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.667
There was nothin' in the b--
I don't carry no guns, man.

11:58.700 --> 12:01.600
-Okay.
-And so-- What so happens
was that he happened to say,

12:01.633 --> 12:03.367
"Hey-- hey, I'm gonna
drop somethin' off
in your car."

12:03.400 --> 12:05.067
I don't know what
he's droppin' off in there.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.800
I don't have to carry
none of that (bleep), man.

12:07.833 --> 12:12.300
I don't-- Dude, my whole--
You can consider me
a (bleep) soccer dad, dude.

12:12.333 --> 12:15.167
This is what I do
is raise my son.
I'm part of the PTA, dude.

12:15.200 --> 12:18.233
-We wanna believe you.
We wanna believe that's
not your gun, but...

12:18.267 --> 12:21.933
when we find the gun
in your backpack,
that you're claiming is yours,

12:21.967 --> 12:24.567
with your wallet
with your ID in there...
-I said it's mine.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.400
-...okay, it looks kinda--
it looks bad for you, right?

12:26.433 --> 12:29.667
-It does, it does.
-So, in order for this
to maybe look better for you,

12:29.700 --> 12:31.567
we need you to kinda
cooperate with us, right?

12:31.600 --> 12:34.500
Give us your nephew's name.
Maybe a phone number,
where he lives,

12:34.533 --> 12:37.600
so we can actually
talk to him, and get his side
of the story, right?

12:37.633 --> 12:41.433
-'Cause if he comes up
on the gun, says "Yeah,
that's mine..."

12:41.467 --> 12:44.433
-I'm (bleep) either way
I look at it, man.
-No, you're not.

12:44.467 --> 12:47.300
Like I said, okay?
If you give us your nephew's
name and how we can

12:47.333 --> 12:50.467
get a hold of him...
-Dude, getting a hold--
getting-- getting a hold

12:50.500 --> 12:54.167
of him is... is the only
way my sister knows
how to get hold of him.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.733
-Okay.
-And that's--
that's why I wanted her--

12:56.767 --> 12:58.600
-We're tryin' to help
you out, man.
-I know you are, man,

12:58.633 --> 13:00.567
but...
-What's his name?

13:00.600 --> 13:03.267
-I can't give you--
I can't give you the name, dude.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.433
-All right.
-And then I don't wanna (bleep).

13:05.467 --> 13:06.733
-Hang tight, brother.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.667
Because he's a convicted felon,
he's prohibited from having
any firearms or ammunition.

13:12.700 --> 13:16.667
Uh, and so in this case,
he's got a fully loaded firearm,

13:16.700 --> 13:20.700
and he's transporting it
in a vehicle which is gonna be
a violation of several codes.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.567
So right now,
he's bein' arrested for bein'
in possession

13:22.600 --> 13:24.900
of a stolen firearm, a felon
in possession of a firearm,

13:24.933 --> 13:26.733
transporting a loaded firearm,
and there'll be a couple

13:26.767 --> 13:29.667
other charges that are gonna
go along with that.

13:31.733 --> 13:35.700
-I'm from Stockton.
Still have really strong
ties here.

13:35.733 --> 13:39.300
Live in town, and, uh,
have a lot of family here.

13:39.333 --> 13:42.367
My brother's actually
on the force as well.

13:42.400 --> 13:48.067
So we hold Stockton
close to us, and we'll be here
for our whole career.

13:48.067 --> 13:51.067
-We just ran the, uh,
license plate on this car
and it comes back

13:51.067 --> 13:52.833
to a, uh, stolen vehicle.

13:52.867 --> 13:54.700
So we're gonna make a stop
on it.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.233
Looks like it's occupied
one time.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.733
-50, it appears
to be yielding so far.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.500
Looks like
it's occupied by an X.

14:12.533 --> 14:15.300
Driver, keep your hands up!

14:15.333 --> 14:17.767
-Keep your hands up!
-Hands out the window!

14:19.167 --> 14:21.633
-Go ahead and drop that can.
-(can clatters)

14:21.667 --> 14:23.867
-Open the car door
with your left hand.

14:26.100 --> 14:27.533
Keep your hands up.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.067
Come on out.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.700
Hands up.
Hands up.

14:35.733 --> 14:38.100
Interlace your fingers
behind your head.

14:38.133 --> 14:39.733
Walk backwards.

14:39.767 --> 14:43.200
Walk backwards.
Walk backwards.
Walk backwards.

14:43.233 --> 14:44.367
Stop.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.500
-We're callin' the driver out.

14:46.533 --> 14:47.933
-Anybody else in the car?
-She's complying.

14:47.967 --> 14:49.067
I don't think so.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.233
-Let us know when
you're ready.
-Anyone else in the car?

14:53.267 --> 14:55.700
-There's nobody else.

14:55.733 --> 14:57.633
-Which side we goin' up on?

14:57.667 --> 15:00.433
-(siren chirps)

15:04.567 --> 15:05.733
-Clear.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.867
-That's good.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.300
-That worked out.
-Cool.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.833
-One in custody, code four.

15:15.967 --> 15:17.900
How you doin', Tiffany?
-Um, not good.

15:17.933 --> 15:20.067
-Whose car is this?
-I have no idea.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.700
My friend asked me
to drive it for him, and--
-Who's your friend?

15:22.733 --> 15:26.067
-Um, his name is, uh, Matt.
I don't know his last name.

15:26.067 --> 15:29.333
Matthew, um, something
with an S.

15:29.367 --> 15:32.367
He stays right here
off of-- um, I don't remember
the name of the road,

15:32.400 --> 15:35.933
it's an L?
It's off of--
by Kelly-Moore paints?

15:35.967 --> 15:38.433
-Matthew S...
-Yeah, I don't know his--

15:38.467 --> 15:40.800
-Stays somewhere
on a street with an L?

15:40.833 --> 15:43.500
-No-- Yeah, I don't remember
the street name.
-Near Kelly paints?

15:43.533 --> 15:45.067
-Yeah.
-Okay.

15:45.067 --> 15:47.500
I'm gonna take your hat off.

15:47.533 --> 15:49.067
No weapons in the car?
-No, sir.

15:49.067 --> 15:51.567
-No needles, no drugs?
-Not to my knowledge, no, sir.

15:51.600 --> 15:54.067
-How long you been
drivin' it?
-I-- Just, like, five minutes.

15:54.100 --> 15:55.900
-I-- He asked me--
-How did you get it to start?

15:55.933 --> 15:58.467
-He asked me to do a favor.
There's a screwdriver, he said,
that was in the seat.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
-So you got a screwdriver
in there?
-Yeah, there's--

16:00.633 --> 16:02.267
-You ever been arrested before?
-Yes, sir, I have.

16:02.300 --> 16:07.467
-What for?
-For, um, paraphernalia
and for, um, uh,

16:07.500 --> 16:09.767
taking a vehicle
without owner's consent.

16:09.800 --> 16:12.533
-Stolen vehicle?
-Yeah. But, uh,
not in this case...

16:12.567 --> 16:14.100
-How many times
you been arrested

16:14.133 --> 16:16.600
for stolen vehicles?
-Um, once.

16:16.633 --> 16:17.933
-That's it?
-Once.

16:17.967 --> 16:19.633
-You on probation right now?
-Yes, sir.

16:19.667 --> 16:23.733
-What for?
-Um... for, um, a DUI.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.133
-DUI.
So you shouldn't
even be driving.

16:26.167 --> 16:27.400
Let alone a stolen car.

16:27.433 --> 16:29.667
-Uh, but I didn't know
it was stolen.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.733
Please, please, please,
and I know exactly
where he stays.

16:31.767 --> 16:34.633
If you could please go there,
and he'll tell you, please.

16:34.667 --> 16:37.367
-So he's gonna take ownership
of this stolen car?
-Yes. Yes. He will,

16:37.400 --> 16:39.700
because he's--
it's his.

16:39.733 --> 16:42.133
I'm asking you, please.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.333
-All right.
-(crying)

16:44.367 --> 16:45.533
-We'll see what we can do.

16:45.567 --> 16:48.067
-Please.
-All right.

16:48.067 --> 16:49.867
Hang on a bit.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.400
Can you make sure
the air is on for her.
-Yeah.

16:55.433 --> 16:58.767
-When I tried to call the owner
to have him come pick up
the car, nobody answered,

16:58.800 --> 17:00.633
so I left a message for him.
-Okay.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.867
-I guess we'll get a tow, then?
-Yeah.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.400
-How long ago was it stolen?
-Uh, the 15th?
Four days.

17:08.433 --> 17:10.467
-Okay.

17:10.500 --> 17:14.133
-So we searched the car,
and, uh, we found a screwdriver
in the--

17:14.167 --> 17:17.900
in between the seats here.
Uh, looks like the ignition's
punched out,

17:17.933 --> 17:22.100
so the screwdriver
was probably used
to start the car.

17:22.133 --> 17:25.133
-(engine starts)
-Yeah, starts right up.

17:26.600 --> 17:27.933
-How long you known Matt?

17:27.967 --> 17:31.067
-Um, like a month
and a half.

17:31.067 --> 17:34.133
And I also know
that he's-- he's got a--
he's got a parole--

17:34.167 --> 17:35.733
he's runnin' from parole
right now.

17:35.767 --> 17:37.500
-Oh, yeah?

17:37.533 --> 17:40.067
You got a... drug addiction?
-No.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.933
-No?
You sure?

17:41.967 --> 17:43.567
-Yes, sir.
-You don't use anything?

17:43.600 --> 17:46.567
-Weed.
-That's it?

17:46.600 --> 17:48.433
-Yeah.
-Never used crystal?

17:48.467 --> 17:50.667
-I used to use crystal
and I don't anymore.
-How long ago?

17:52.533 --> 17:53.800
-Couple months.

17:53.833 --> 17:56.433
-So you've been clean
for a couple of months.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.700
-I've been telling you,
I'm trying to do right--
-But you're involved

17:58.733 --> 18:00.567
in these crimes
that are--
-Well, I didn't know

18:00.600 --> 18:05.133
this was-- it was stolen,
I just thought I was
helpin' my friend, I didn't--

18:05.167 --> 18:10.333
You keep involving yourself
with these situations, though,
that... don't look good for you.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.567
-I know.
-You gotta change.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.233
We can't have you--
There's enough criminals
out here. We can't have you--

18:15.267 --> 18:18.400
-I don't even wanna be
a criminal anymore.
You guys don't even understand

18:18.433 --> 18:20.967
how bad I wish
that I could just, like,
get my (bleep) phone

18:21.067 --> 18:23.133
to get a charge
so I could call the person,

18:23.167 --> 18:26.100
so he could, like--
like I don't even--

18:26.133 --> 18:28.167
(sobbing)
You don't know.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.200
Like usually I don't cry
like this. I'm not like
hey, hey, hey. I'm usually

18:31.233 --> 18:34.200
(bleep) not cooperative,
and I'm-- you know
what I mean?

18:34.233 --> 18:36.333
-Yeah.
-And I'm trying to change
all that, like...

18:36.367 --> 18:39.333
-Yeah. No, we appreciate that.
We see that.

18:40.900 --> 18:46.067
But... unfortunately,
even if we are able
to get a hold of Matthew

18:46.067 --> 18:49.967
and get his side of the story,
you're still in possession
of this stolen car.

18:50.067 --> 18:51.867
It doesn't belong to you.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.833
And you've been around
long enough that you need
to use common sense

18:54.867 --> 18:59.533
and understand
that a punched ignition,
a screwdriver, a guy

18:59.567 --> 19:01.800
who you've only known
for a month who you don't
have a phone number

19:01.833 --> 19:06.167
and address for,
tellin' you to drive his car,
is probably not normal.

19:08.067 --> 19:10.367
Hopefully you really
can change, but--
-Is there a possibility

19:10.400 --> 19:12.633
that I could get a charge
on my phone, though,
so I can--

19:12.667 --> 19:13.967
-We'll try
to get your phone charged up,

19:14.067 --> 19:17.567
but unfortunately, you gotta go
for the stolen car today.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.633
-But I have a bail, right?

19:19.667 --> 19:22.333
-Yeah, they'll get
that all to you once you
get to the jail.

19:22.367 --> 19:24.467
-But I'm goin'
to the police department
first, right?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.267
-Yeah.
-Okay.

19:26.300 --> 19:29.800
-All right.
-And I can make phone calls
in there and everything, right?

19:29.833 --> 19:31.200
-Yes, ma'am.

19:32.567 --> 19:34.833
-Hey, Tiffany, how old are you?
-26.

19:34.867 --> 19:37.333
-You're still pretty young.
You got plenty of time
to turn your life around

19:37.367 --> 19:40.067
and get things right. Okay?

19:40.100 --> 19:42.067
-All right, Tiffany.
Good luck.

19:43.733 --> 19:46.300
She's gotta kick
this drug habit, though.
That's my guess is,

19:46.333 --> 19:48.400
she's still stuck on meth.
-Yeah, for sure.

19:49.533 --> 19:51.767
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.900
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.933 --> 19:55.600
Cover is code three.

19:55.633 --> 19:59.067
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.200 --> 20:05.867
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:08.267 --> 20:13.167
-(theme music playing)
