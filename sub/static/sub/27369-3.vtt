05:08.850 --> 05:10.977
<i>They are very concerned</i>
<i>that you are the one who did it.</i>

07:01.713 --> 07:04.174
<i>-This feels like a damn game, man.</i>
<i>-What's that?</i>

07:04.257 --> 07:06.259
<i>-This is bullshit.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

07:06.343 --> 07:10.138
<i>I don't know why they keep on me.</i>
<i>They know I didn't do this.</i>

12:00.303 --> 12:04.682
<i>Did you find any pubic hairs</i>
<i>that match that of Dennis Fritz?</i>

12:04.766 --> 12:05.850
<i>Yes sir, I did.</i>

12:05.934 --> 12:09.604
<i>I found one pubic hair</i>
<i>from the wash cloth.</i>

12:09.687 --> 12:12.732
<i>My opinion that it is consistent,</i>

12:12.815 --> 12:16.319
<i>microscopically,</i>
<i>with Dennis Fritz' pubic hair.</i>

12:56.859 --> 13:01.739
<i>Did you find any hairs</i>
<i>were consistent, microscopically,</i>

13:01.823 --> 13:04.784
<i>with that of Ron Williamson?</i>

13:04.867 --> 13:05.868
<i>Yes I did.</i>

13:06.452 --> 13:10.456
<i>There were two pubic hairs</i>
<i>also from the bedding,</i>

13:10.790 --> 13:14.210
<i>these two hairs were consistent,</i>
<i>microscopically,</i>

13:14.294 --> 13:16.504
<i>to Ron Williamson's known pubic hair.</i>

13:37.442 --> 13:40.153
<i>I mean, I can't answer</i>
<i>any more truthful than I answered them.</i>

13:41.362 --> 13:43.323
<i>It looks like to me...</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:46.659
<i>that if you can't find out</i>
<i>the guy who did this,</i>

13:47.327 --> 13:49.120
<i>in this small a town...</i>

13:49.912 --> 13:51.164
<i>you know,</i>

13:51.247 --> 13:52.999
<i>what in the hell?</i>

13:53.082 --> 13:55.501
<i>Why don't you look into the people</i>
<i>that can hide that shit?</i>

14:25.740 --> 14:27.658
<i>"I ended up at Debbie Carter's door,</i>

14:27.742 --> 14:31.162
<i>knocked on the door, and she said,</i>
<i>'Just a minute, I'm on the phone.'</i>

14:31.746 --> 14:34.832
<i>I burst in the door,</i>
<i>raped and killed her."</i>

14:35.625 --> 14:38.169
<i>That's a dream. I did not do that.</i>

17:25.253 --> 17:27.088
<i>They don't know you didn't do it.</i>

17:28.005 --> 17:30.675
<i>They are very concerned</i>
<i>that you are the one that did it.</i>

17:32.635 --> 17:35.972
<i>Don't you think they've got better things</i>
<i>to do than keep coming back on you?</i>

17:36.055 --> 17:38.266
<i>No, I think that's it.</i>

18:21.017 --> 18:22.685
<i>I appreciate what you're doing.</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:25.104
<i>I know what you're saying</i>
<i>about getting clean reads.</i>

18:25.187 --> 18:28.357
<i>But hell, I thought I was,</i>
<i>done damn good on it.</i>

18:52.840 --> 18:55.801
<i>Sometimes it's a guy who just...</i>
<i>things came down too heavy</i>

18:55.885 --> 18:57.887
<i>at one time so he popped.</i>

18:58.471 --> 18:59.972
<i>I understand it.</i>

19:00.056 --> 19:02.475
<i>I'm sad that they was inconclusive</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:04.894
<i>'cause I wanted to desperately</i>
<i>clear myself in there.</i>

19:04.977 --> 19:06.187
<i>I understand.</i>

19:35.841 --> 19:39.595
<i>Well, I'm just sad it didn't turn...</i>
<i>I was really confident I could come here</i>

19:39.679 --> 19:41.722
<i>and get this thing over with, so...</i>

19:59.824 --> 20:01.784
<i>Anything else I oughta know about?</i>

20:02.743 --> 20:03.577
<i>No.</i>

20:03.911 --> 20:05.246
<i>Good luck to ya.</i>

23:12.266 --> 23:15.436
<i>I intentionally went there</i>
<i>to kill somebody...</i>

23:16.604 --> 23:18.439
<i>and not to rape somebody.</i>

23:20.566 --> 23:23.903
<i>I guess I was, you know,</i>
<i>trying to get in bed with her</i>

23:24.695 --> 23:27.072
<i>She started pushing and shoving.</i>

23:27.740 --> 23:30.951
<i>Swinging, pushing me away, you know,</i>
<i>just freaked out.</i>

23:33.287 --> 23:35.247
<i>I believe I did something out of anger.</i>

24:06.070 --> 24:07.863
<i>Because she knew who I was...</i>

24:08.572 --> 24:10.324
<i>I believe I killed her.</i>

24:11.700 --> 24:12.701
<i>Strangled her.</i>

25:10.217 --> 25:12.094
<i>Ron Williamson:</i>
<i>Well, he did it! He said he did it!</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:14.054
<i>Kim Marks: Remember who you're talking to.</i>

25:14.138 --> 25:15.723
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-I'm on your side, okay.</i>

25:15.973 --> 25:18.100
<i>-So that's all you wanna do on the video?</i>
<i>-That's all.</i>

25:18.183 --> 25:20.477
<i>You wanna do it one more time,</i>
<i>to make sure we've got it?</i>

25:21.061 --> 25:22.563
<i>It's up to you, we don't have to.</i>

25:22.688 --> 25:24.356
<i>-I don't wanna do it.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

25:25.357 --> 25:27.776
<i>Well, I'll turn it off then.</i>
<i>That was pretty easy.</i>

25:53.927 --> 25:59.391
<i>That moron won't cooperate with me at all.</i>
<i>If he was paying me I wouldn't be here.</i>

25:59.475 --> 26:02.644
<i>I can't represent him, Judge,</i>
<i>I just can't do it.</i>

26:02.728 --> 26:05.481
<i>I don't know who's going to, but I can't.</i>

26:31.965 --> 26:35.177
<i>I'm not gonna put up with this.</i>
<i>I'm too damned old for it, Judge.</i>

26:36.512 --> 26:40.724
<i>I don't want anything to do with it,</i>
<i>not under any circumstances.</i>

26:40.808 --> 26:43.811
<i>I have no idea about his guilt,</i>
<i>that has nothing to do with it,</i>

26:43.894 --> 26:46.855
<i>but I'm not gonna put up with this.</i>

26:46.939 --> 26:49.691
<i>Judge: At this time, I'm gonna ask</i>
<i>that you clear the courtroom.</i>

28:01.763 --> 28:06.810
<i>I was sentenced to die on September 27th</i>
<i>of this year for a crime I didn't commit,</i>

28:06.894 --> 28:09.980
<i>a heinous, atrocious</i>
<i>and cruel murder to one...</i>

39:41.170 --> 39:43.381
<i>Reporter: How do you feel</i>
<i>about what happened here today?</i>

40:06.237 --> 40:08.573
<i>Reporter: How close did you come</i>
<i>to being executed?</i>

45:59.131 --> 46:01.968
When I see other people too
that's being released

46:02.051 --> 46:04.303
for wrongful convictions and stuff,

46:04.387 --> 46:05.846
man, I cry.

46:06.472 --> 46:08.015
A blessing...

46:15.398 --> 46:17.650
<i>It's an overwhelming blessing.</i>

46:17.733 --> 46:20.278
<i>I pray and ask God,</i>
<i>I wish it was me, you know.</i>

46:45.636 --> 46:46.929
Good to see you, Tommy.

46:47.013 --> 46:48.764
It's sure good to see you too.

47:48.783 --> 47:51.452
<i>Each day I just take it one day</i>
<i>at a time, you know,</i>

47:51.535 --> 47:56.665
and you canÂ either come in here
and be just as salty and bitter about it,

47:56.749 --> 47:59.460
or you can do everything you can

47:59.543 --> 48:01.629
<i>to try your best to get out.</i>

48:05.299 --> 48:08.761
Stay in touch.
Give me a call next week, for sure.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.351
I pray all the time,

48:15.434 --> 48:19.397
that's something would fall through,
you know, that would prove it.

48:21.232 --> 48:22.900
<i>I don't know what, you know, but</i>

48:23.567 --> 48:25.820
<i>I hope something will fall through.</i>

48:52.596 --> 48:55.975
<i>I was dreaming that I looked up</i>
<i>and my cell door was open</i>

48:56.058 --> 48:57.601
<i>and I hear this voice say,</i>

48:58.185 --> 49:00.980
<i>"I can take you and show you</i>
<i>where Denice is at."</i>

49:02.857 --> 49:04.817
<i>I said, "Where?" He said, "Follow me."</i>

49:05.651 --> 49:07.570
<i>And I started to walk out the door,</i>

49:07.653 --> 49:09.989
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>
<i>I feel this weird feeling.</i>

49:10.072 --> 49:10.906
<i>I said...</i>

49:12.658 --> 49:13.993
<i>"Who are you?"</i>

49:14.702 --> 49:15.578
<i>And...</i>

49:16.495 --> 49:17.955
<i>he said, "Does it matter?"</i>

49:18.038 --> 49:19.081
<i>I said, "Yeah."</i>

49:19.165 --> 49:23.085
<i>And then for some reason, I said,</i>
<i>"Are you a God or are you the Devil?"</i>

49:25.254 --> 49:28.466
And as soon as I said that, I woke up.
