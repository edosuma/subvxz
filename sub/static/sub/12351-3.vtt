WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.467
<i>Previously on Greek...</i>

00:01.835 --> 00:05.254
- what are the guns for?
- It's for gotcha, the assassin game.

00:05.918 --> 00:08.215
The object of the game
is to eliminate your assigned target.

00:09.026 --> 00:11.761
- We kissed. That was it.
- Yeah, at a KT party.

00:11.930 --> 00:15.222
We're just gonna have to be better
and try to keep it quiet

00:15.390 --> 00:16.429
if this continues.

00:16.694 --> 00:18.392
I didn't kiss Evan at the {\end of the world }party.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.839
- I kissed Fisher.
- What?

00:19.964 --> 00:22.063
- I'm such an idiot.
- How can I trust you again?

00:22.232 --> 00:22.980
I can't.

00:30.968 --> 00:32.668
Wait, I have a question.

00:33.158 --> 00:34.816
Yes, I've been tested.

00:35.842 --> 00:37.870
- Everything's positive.
- What?

00:38.407 --> 00:39.707
I mean negative.

00:40.220 --> 00:42.166
I mean in a positive way.

00:46.131 --> 00:48.923
- Dale's not gonna walk in on us, right?
- No.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.509
I mean I guess he could.

00:52.224 --> 00:54.474
- He probably won't.
- Well, are you sure?

00:54.599 --> 00:57.223
Because the whole my dad walking in
on us thing kind of freaked me out.

00:57.411 --> 00:59.161
OK. We can go to my room.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.566
- I gotta go to my lab session.
- Are you serious?

01:07.857 --> 01:09.110
But if we make it quick...

01:09.603 --> 01:10.861
Yeah, rushing things,

01:11.029 --> 01:12.793
- not so romantic.
- We don't...

01:12.918 --> 01:15.018
We could skip ahead a few steps.

01:17.669 --> 01:19.269
That's rushing things.

01:20.295 --> 01:22.249
You know, we've waited this long,

01:22.612 --> 01:24.458
so why hurry now, right?

01:25.457 --> 01:26.457
Right.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.630
I have somewhere to be, anyway.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.634
But believe me, it's gonna happen.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:44.613 --> 01:46.177
Oh, reminder, reminder: there

01:46.302 --> 01:48.816
are only four more gym days
until Friday's undie run.

01:48.985 --> 01:51.927
It's the titans' game against state,
and what better way to show our support

01:52.052 --> 01:54.340
than running around campus in...

01:55.074 --> 01:56.699
very little support.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.106
I did two sessions
of bikram yoga today.

02:01.243 --> 02:02.947
I sweated out a small child

02:03.072 --> 02:04.915
and I think I pulled my core.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.920
What are those?

02:11.695 --> 02:14.175
- Just some cookies.
- That we won't be eating.

02:14.519 --> 02:16.745
I don't know
why he brought those out.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.389
But that does remind me
of some old business:

02:20.557 --> 02:23.476
Fisher and I broke up because
he made out with someone at the{\ end of the world} party

02:23.644 --> 02:25.436
whose name isn't worth saying.

02:28.582 --> 02:29.315
You.

02:30.503 --> 02:31.903
Activities report.

02:35.870 --> 02:38.282
The gotcha game is down
to roughly 20 people,

02:38.450 --> 02:40.910
including three zeta betas.
The prize money's nice,

02:41.079 --> 02:43.494
but what we really want are points
towards the greek blue ribbon,

02:43.619 --> 02:46.624
which is handed out every spring
to the best house on campus.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.125
So I'm trying really hard
to make that happen

02:52.250 --> 02:54.882
because, as you know, I love
zeta beta zeta

02:55.050 --> 02:57.510
- and all my beautiful sisters.
- Thank you...

02:57.678 --> 02:58.469
you.

02:59.075 --> 03:00.375
Pledge educator.

03:01.140 --> 03:02.890
Not much this week.

03:03.656 --> 03:05.538
The pledges are still pledge-y.

03:09.399 --> 03:12.858
Pan-hellenic delegate? Any juicy goss
from our governing sorority body?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.958
First, the board gave a report.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.646
Then they proposed doing an ice cream
social with a different flavor

03:17.771 --> 03:19.835
for each house,
which I said was a lame idea.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.024
But they said it'd be fun, so I told
those bitches it was a waste of money.

03:23.149 --> 03:25.586
But those bitches wouldn't listen,
so that's when I said,

03:25.711 --> 03:27.414
"bite me," and walked out.

03:28.122 --> 03:28.874
Bitches.

03:30.573 --> 03:33.309
Well, this feels
like a good place to stop.

03:33.434 --> 03:34.713
Happy undie run training.

03:40.576 --> 03:43.280
I think need to replace Laura.
She's burnt out on pan-hellenic.

03:43.405 --> 03:44.890
Yeah, I know the feeling.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.226
Your report was a little sparse.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.140
I'm so bored with the pledges.

03:49.265 --> 03:51.592
I'm a senior. I should
be doing something more.

03:51.717 --> 03:54.407
Last week, my father said
the world better watch out for me.

03:54.532 --> 03:57.171
And I'm thinking, why?
Because of my ability to name

03:57.296 --> 03:59.613
every guy Carrie Bradshaw
has slept with in season order?

03:59.998 --> 04:01.784
- I've always admired that.
- You know,

04:01.909 --> 04:04.618
I could do pan-hellenic.
What do you think?

04:05.098 --> 04:06.161
I think yeah!

04:06.689 --> 04:08.438
Do you think Laura would be OK?

04:08.912 --> 04:11.600
Laura, is it OK
if Casey does pan-hellenic?

04:11.725 --> 04:13.853
Tell those bitches
I'll see them in hell.

04:14.539 --> 04:15.796
Sounds like a yes to me.

04:26.669 --> 04:29.215
Jordan's dad walked in on us,
which was horrible.

04:29.340 --> 04:31.169
Horribly funny.
Sorry.

04:31.294 --> 04:33.814
Then we kept getting interrupted,
and now...

04:33.982 --> 04:37.603
it feels like we're past that point
of sex occurring naturally.

04:38.475 --> 04:40.232
We're slipping
back into the friend zone.

04:40.357 --> 04:41.666
You want me to talk to her?

04:41.791 --> 04:43.741
She's in Pierson hall, right?

04:44.480 --> 04:47.161
What about you and Grant?
You guys haven't done it yet either.

04:47.359 --> 04:49.360
Boxing rules are still in effect:

04:49.485 --> 04:51.135
nothing below the belt.

04:51.675 --> 04:53.417
All we want is a romantic date.

04:54.048 --> 04:55.461
Don't you share a room?

04:55.896 --> 04:58.389
We're living in a fraternity house.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.719
We might as well not have any doors.

05:02.050 --> 05:03.552
Anyway, the new plan is to wait

05:03.677 --> 05:06.240
till everyone goes
o the date dash at Dobler's tonight,

05:06.365 --> 05:08.560
and then break out
the popcorn and a movie.

05:10.228 --> 05:12.924
{\I see }You're still playing the gotcha game.
You're not the jackass

05:13.049 --> 05:14.271
everyone's talking about?

05:14.821 --> 05:16.180
It's the jackal, OK?

05:16.305 --> 05:18.669
And yes, I'm still playing.
And no, I'm not him,

05:19.040 --> 05:21.556
I wouldn't mind taking him out.
I heard he already has nine kills.

05:21.681 --> 05:24.570
I've been so busy with classes,
I haven't even opened my envelope yet.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.261
What? How the hell
has nobody killed you yet?

05:28.012 --> 05:31.087
Rusty, you gotta get in the game!
Open your envelope right now.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.812
I don't even have a gun.

05:40.292 --> 05:41.942
What do they look like?

05:43.052 --> 05:44.302
Check this out.

05:53.089 --> 05:54.186
What{\ the hell} was that?

05:57.544 --> 05:59.233
You've had me the whole time?

05:59.402 --> 06:02.152
Your envelope... please.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.499
No wonder you were asking about her.

06:15.668 --> 06:18.711
- Jordan's your target.
- Correction: your target.

06:20.979 --> 06:22.715
Good luck doing it now.

06:35.108 --> 06:36.854
- Are you covering for Laura?
- I am.

06:37.607 --> 06:38.918
And I'm sorry

06:39.043 --> 06:40.939
she told you to, "bite me."

06:41.064 --> 06:42.818
So she cleaned it up
for you guys then.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.111
I'm really surprised to see you here.
You sort of fell off the grid.

06:47.799 --> 06:49.417
What have you been up to?

06:49.542 --> 06:51.798
I'm sure you heard
about me and Evan.

06:51.923 --> 06:55.364
And then I was dating this grad student,
Max, but we broke up.

06:55.489 --> 06:57.961
So it's been kind of more or less...

06:59.736 --> 07:01.326
- You may...
- Riveting.

07:01.795 --> 07:02.629
Really.

07:09.634 --> 07:10.554
Got it, yeah.

07:15.211 --> 07:17.011
I, as president,
note that everyone is here.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.520
Please mark that in the book.

07:18.689 --> 07:21.153
Moving on, I'd like
to introduce Casey Cartwright,

07:21.278 --> 07:24.359
former zbz president,
who just had an amazing internship

07:24.527 --> 07:27.654
with maryland's 43rd district
congresswoman, Paula Baker.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.825
I hope this won't
be a one-day visit with us.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.035
Moving on.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.091
- It's your birthday!
- Yes{\, it is}.

07:36.216 --> 07:38.499
- Happy birthday.
- Where was the reminder e-mail?

07:38.841 --> 07:40.514
Maybe next year. Moving on.

07:40.639 --> 07:42.377
Update on the library expansion?

07:42.546 --> 07:44.630
Well, the early construction

07:44.799 --> 07:46.673
could be a nuisance to the row,

07:46.842 --> 07:50.483
but I think we can obtain
and enforce 8am permits.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.208
So, I'll get back to you, Kat.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.032
Moving on. I wanna remind everyone
about our meeting

07:58.157 --> 08:00.660
with the ifc tomorrow
to decide whether or not

08:00.785 --> 08:03.357
we are gonna participate
in the undie run.

08:03.722 --> 08:04.650
Comments?

08:05.952 --> 08:08.725
I just have to say
that I love the undie run.

08:08.850 --> 08:11.490
Everyone loves the undie run.
And for some of us

08:11.658 --> 08:14.476
who are seniors,
it's our last chance to do it.

08:14.601 --> 08:15.949
So... Yay.

08:19.175 --> 08:21.290
OK. I appreciate
your enthusiasm, ZBZ.

08:21.415 --> 08:23.210
We'll take that
into careful consideration.

08:23.379 --> 08:24.336
Moving on...

08:26.882 --> 08:27.729
92,

08:27.854 --> 08:28.507
93,

08:28.675 --> 08:29.731
94,

08:29.856 --> 08:30.688
95...

08:30.813 --> 08:32.803
- What are you guys counting?
- Seconds, Rus.

08:33.169 --> 08:34.138
95...

08:34.307 --> 08:35.984
- For what?
- ... ninety-six.

08:52.047 --> 08:53.514
Five for five.

08:53.940 --> 08:55.868
I wish I had
a few good men like you, Beav.

08:56.037 --> 08:58.396
- Thanks.
- Too bad you're the last KT standing.

08:58.820 --> 09:01.163
Actually, beaver is not

09:01.288 --> 09:03.083
- the only kappa tau left.
- Old news, Rus.

09:03.854 --> 09:05.542
Jeremy got taken out today
at 0800 hours

09:05.667 --> 09:07.617
while he was chatting up
a hot Tri-Pi.

09:07.929 --> 09:10.799
- Turns out it was a honey-trap.
- -We all know what a talker Jeremy is.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.018
I meant me.

09:12.492 --> 09:13.792
I'm still alive.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.289
That's funny.

09:22.562 --> 09:23.812
You're being...

09:24.614 --> 09:25.614
Funny.

09:27.308 --> 09:29.109
Seriously?
How are you still alive?

09:29.373 --> 09:30.343
I don't know.

09:30.468 --> 09:33.197
I've been in the mitchell physics
library, the McGovern science lab

09:33.322 --> 09:34.709
and hart engineering building.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.783
I've never heard
of any of those places.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.660
Exactly.
Do you know what this means?

09:39.003 --> 09:40.495
That I'm kinda awesome?

09:40.878 --> 09:43.235
No, that being a geek
saved your life.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.169
You're one of our last hopes
of winning the $500 grand prize.

09:47.338 --> 09:50.255
The KT party budget
is woefully overdrawn. We need this.

09:52.803 --> 09:53.967
Welcome to Kappa force.

09:58.009 --> 10:00.695
- There's one problem.
- You're slow afoot and you can't shoot?

10:00.820 --> 10:02.829
No, Jordan's my target.

10:04.390 --> 10:06.772
Awkward, but easy.
Just get it done.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.021
I'm on it.

10:11.131 --> 10:12.344
He's so young, Cap.

10:13.491 --> 10:15.972
- And The Jackal's still out there.
- Indeed, Beav.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.333
The beginning of the end...

10:20.061 --> 10:21.277
... is starting.

10:22.690 --> 10:23.452
Now.

10:24.279 --> 10:25.439
Again.

10:26.217 --> 10:27.580
This summer.

10:31.663 --> 10:32.952
I'm gonna go again.

10:35.835 --> 10:38.696
So much fun, you guys.
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

10:41.696 --> 10:43.522
Well, anything beats
the "bite me" girl.

10:49.793 --> 10:50.987
Hold that, please.

11:19.038 --> 11:20.640
When's your next lab session?

11:23.614 --> 11:24.903
In five minutes.

11:33.589 --> 11:36.264
You know, this is the best part
about us waiting.

11:37.662 --> 11:39.385
I feel really safe with you.

11:44.222 --> 11:48.152
I don't know. Between my crazy dad
and your crazy schedule,

11:49.421 --> 11:51.639
I hope you don't think
I don't want to.

11:53.725 --> 11:54.713
You do want to?

11:56.112 --> 11:58.179
I didn't want to rush you
but I didn't want to end up

11:58.262 --> 11:59.624
in the friend zone either.

11:59.707 --> 12:01.270
You seriously thought that?

12:03.083 --> 12:04.677
We were friends before,

12:05.786 --> 12:08.018
and we have been dating
since mid-terms.

12:08.302 --> 12:10.954
I figured if it was something that
you wanted, it would have already...

12:11.037 --> 12:13.355
OK. Rusty? Just so you know,

12:13.598 --> 12:16.654
I rarely try to swallow
my friends' tongues.

12:20.314 --> 12:21.397
Good to know.

12:22.831 --> 12:23.981
And trust me,

12:24.382 --> 12:25.679
I want to do more.

12:29.548 --> 12:30.540
Tomorrow night?

12:31.085 --> 12:32.428
Sounds perfect.

12:55.303 --> 12:56.206
All clear.

12:56.602 --> 12:58.086
- They're gone.
- All right.

12:58.169 --> 12:59.861
Gay film festival time.

13:00.336 --> 13:02.684
Which Hugh Jackman movie
should we watch?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.794
Wolverine, Australia

13:05.118 --> 13:06.338
or Kate & Leopold?

13:06.711 --> 13:07.411
K & L.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.962
But you hate that one.

13:10.481 --> 13:12.457
If you kiss me, I will consider it.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.589
- I saw your light on.
- You're here!

13:19.757 --> 13:21.206
- I'm here.
- We're here.

13:21.289 --> 13:23.635
Why the hell aren't you at Dobler's?

13:25.444 --> 13:26.729
I just had other plans.

13:27.170 --> 13:27.955
And you?

13:29.180 --> 13:31.643
You know,
we're just both taking it easy tonight.

13:34.152 --> 13:35.188
I have to study.

13:35.826 --> 13:37.232
You're watching a movie.

13:37.400 --> 13:38.082
Yes.

13:38.607 --> 13:39.651
After the movie.

13:41.953 --> 13:43.960
You guys are watching
Kate & Leopold?

13:44.312 --> 13:45.407
I love this movie.

13:45.942 --> 13:47.458
- Seriously?
- No.

13:47.771 --> 13:49.153
No. Let's watch Wolverine.

13:50.013 --> 13:50.811
Great.

13:51.343 --> 13:52.497
It's got Hugh Jackman.

13:53.289 --> 13:54.779
Yeah, he's pretty bad-ass.

14:02.587 --> 14:04.134
Why are the girls so grumpy?

14:04.759 --> 14:06.757
They're just hungry
because of the Undie Run.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.475
Cabbage soup isn't very filling.

14:08.807 --> 14:10.223
Or aromatic, Betsy.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.149
Stay out of my life, Ashleigh!

14:13.552 --> 14:14.227
So,

14:14.395 --> 14:15.979
ask me about Pan-hellenic.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.397
How was pan-hellenic?

14:17.565 --> 14:20.315
Awesome. I haven't felt this involved
since I was president.

14:20.696 --> 14:22.652
The only bummer
was running into Evan.

14:23.537 --> 14:26.806
I totally get it.
It is impossible to be around your ex.

14:27.255 --> 14:29.467
Why can't they just
get the hint and go away?

14:31.017 --> 14:33.446
I honestly believed that I'd be

14:33.529 --> 14:35.622
Casey Cartwright-Chambers one day,

14:35.978 --> 14:38.710
and now I haven't even spoken to him
in over six months.

14:43.777 --> 14:46.259
Someone doesn't care
what they look like at the Undie Run.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.636
Because we can't go.

14:48.011 --> 14:49.059
- Shut up!
- What?

14:49.142 --> 14:51.139
Those bitches on Pan-hellenic
voted to dock

14:51.307 --> 14:54.492
three blue ribbon points from any house
whose girls do the Undie Run.

14:54.997 --> 14:57.312
- I'm still on their e-mail list.
- Those bitches!

14:57.596 --> 14:59.645
Thank you. Finally,
someone who understands.

14:59.728 --> 15:01.787
Katherine has been
turning people against it

15:01.870 --> 15:03.318
ever since she became president.

15:03.401 --> 15:06.279
I can't let us run
if we're gonna lose blue ribbon points.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.241
No! I do not go to the gym
five days a week for my health!

15:10.905 --> 15:12.077
Laura, stop eating!

15:13.077 --> 15:15.364
There's a meeting tomorrow.
I can fix this.

15:21.158 --> 15:22.879
I did everything right, Cap.

15:23.204 --> 15:25.140
I exited the house
through the back gate,

15:25.648 --> 15:27.923
I looked over my shoulder
every eight seconds,

15:29.478 --> 15:31.721
I even left class
an hour early every day.

15:33.149 --> 15:34.766
Aren't most classes
only an hour long?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.393
What's your point, Heath?

15:36.765 --> 15:37.852
Give us a minute.

15:41.812 --> 15:42.863
What happened?

15:44.452 --> 15:45.819
These happened, Rus.

15:46.164 --> 15:48.283
Free drink tickets to Dobler's.
All fake.

15:49.486 --> 15:52.830
They showed up for Beaver in the mail
and when he went to redeem them,

15:52.913 --> 15:53.919
he was shot.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.705
- By The Jackal.
- No. Who was it?

15:56.873 --> 15:57.871
Tell him, Cap.

15:59.011 --> 16:01.960
Tell him who shot me.
I would, but I'm dead.

16:02.128 --> 16:05.065
I think rusty should see these
for himself.

16:09.642 --> 16:11.344
- They're pretty realistic.
- Yeah.

16:13.024 --> 16:15.697
Kinda like an art student did them,
don't you think?

16:17.005 --> 16:18.301
Do you know any, Rus?

16:20.924 --> 16:22.280
- No!
- Yes!

16:22.691 --> 16:24.858
The Jackal is Jordan...

16:26.119 --> 16:27.211
... is The Jackal.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.430
- I'm still waiting on that beer.
- Rusty's gonna get it to you, Beav,

16:30.513 --> 16:32.601
because if he'd shot Jordan
like he was supposed to,

16:32.684 --> 16:36.703
none of this would have happened.
Why didn't you eliminate her last night?

16:36.871 --> 16:40.129
- I didn't know she was The Jackal.
- Kicking ass at it does, Rus.

16:40.892 --> 16:42.685
You're Kappa Tau's last hope.

16:42.989 --> 16:44.883
- When do you see jordan next?
- Tonight.

16:45.445 --> 16:47.672
- But I can't shoot her.
- And why not?

16:48.467 --> 16:49.427
Because...

16:49.867 --> 16:52.264
Rus, my spidey-sense is tingling.

16:53.673 --> 16:55.555
You haven't had sex with her yet.

16:56.344 --> 16:57.413
No, but...

16:57.838 --> 17:00.352
- We have this romantic dinner. As...
- It's a trap.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.728
Numbers are dwindling.

17:02.183 --> 17:04.439
You need to kill her
before she eventually gets you.

17:04.607 --> 17:07.342
- I want to have sex with her.
- Kill her, then have sex with her.

17:07.425 --> 17:08.609
It's the KT way.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.042
I didn't mean that.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.070
Well, kill her at least.

17:16.980 --> 17:19.537
Which is why we,
the IFC fraternities,

17:19.704 --> 17:22.846
unanimously support all greeks
participating in this event.

17:23.595 --> 17:26.368
We'll be there with bells on.
And not much else. Thank you.

17:29.790 --> 17:33.093
We, at Pan-hellenic, are deducting
blue ribbon points from sorities

17:33.261 --> 17:35.220
whose sisters choose to participate.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.471
We were unanimous

17:36.956 --> 17:40.392
in voting against the undie run because
of the negative image it promotes.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.367
- Point of order?
- ZBZ?

17:43.450 --> 17:46.856
Actually, the truth is
we're not really unanimous.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.798
ZBZ fully supports it.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.736
Yes, a couple thousand college kids

17:51.904 --> 17:54.713
running around in their underwear
is a little racy,

17:55.027 --> 17:58.743
but it's a 60-year-old tradition
that fosters school spirit and unity.

18:02.185 --> 18:04.457
Can I have your attention
directed over here, please?

18:08.221 --> 18:10.547
No, this is not an abercrombie ad.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.049
It's two of our own inebriated greeks
showing their...

18:13.431 --> 18:15.769
What did you call it, ZBZ?
School spirit?

18:16.429 --> 18:19.478
Here's some KTs
defiling university property.

18:21.379 --> 18:24.018
Actually, can I get a copy of that
when you're done with it?

18:24.186 --> 18:26.365
But they're just guys
being guys, right?

18:26.448 --> 18:29.384
Here's one that sets us
sorority women back 50 years.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.398
I pulled this from facebook.

18:33.730 --> 18:36.072
This girl is the ZBZ president,
believe it or not.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.032
That bra might
as well say "Grope me."

18:38.736 --> 18:39.941
Attention back on me.

18:40.692 --> 18:44.313
So while running around in our underwear
might have been in vogue in the'60s,

18:44.870 --> 18:46.791
I think those of us
who are not in fraternities

18:46.959 --> 18:49.002
can all agree
that we should not participate

18:49.170 --> 18:50.571
in this embarrassing event.

18:52.230 --> 18:54.966
You love the Undie Run.
Will you please say something?

19:03.017 --> 19:05.977
You're a TP. You take off your clothes
for a grocery store grand opening.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.087
Look, don't do this. Don't...

19:10.433 --> 19:12.913
Don't ruin our fun
just to prove a point.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.570
Moving on, ZBZ.

19:20.823 --> 19:23.940
No, you don't understand. We were
making out when Evan walked in on us.

19:24.023 --> 19:26.110
I mean it's a miracle
we didn't get caught.

19:27.186 --> 19:29.501
Why don't you just rent a hotel room
and do it already?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.495
Because it's not about
just having sex.

19:32.092 --> 19:33.905
I mean. Not yet, anyway.

19:33.988 --> 19:36.175
It's about dating someone
who's not out of the closet,

19:36.417 --> 19:39.385
made even more difficult
because the closet is in our room.

19:39.733 --> 19:41.068
So get out of your room.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.564
Yeah. And go where?

19:42.647 --> 19:46.351
Dobler's isn't private, and we can't be
seen leaving gentlemen's choice.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.180
- Which?
- Gay one. I refuse to go to the other.

19:49.571 --> 19:51.816
Which leaves no safe place
to hide grant's gayness.

19:53.589 --> 19:54.567
In Cyprus.

19:58.559 --> 20:01.756
I had no idea
you were such a gourmet.

20:02.184 --> 20:04.913
KT has food network
viewing parties now.

20:05.774 --> 20:08.122
I think Cappie has an oedipal thing
for Paula Deen.

20:11.280 --> 20:12.418
I'm ready.

20:14.150 --> 20:15.073
Get down!

20:21.045 --> 20:22.929
I knew it! Jackal!

20:23.097 --> 20:24.639
Cappie was here the whole time?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.267
You didn't trust me!

20:27.898 --> 20:29.228
You tried to shoot me.

20:30.905 --> 20:32.605
- Rebecca? Why are you here?
- I thought

20:32.773 --> 20:34.816
vampires couldn't enter
without permission.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.484
- Good one.
- I'm protecting you.

20:36.775 --> 20:39.349
- Did you do it?
- If you mean them having sex, no.

20:39.650 --> 20:41.235
If you mean her shooting him, no.

20:41.416 --> 20:44.784
If you mean Jordan peeing herself
when I jumped out, maybe.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.327
And you look hot.

20:46.805 --> 20:48.852
- Thanks.
- So you're The Jackal.

20:49.402 --> 20:50.934
Which makes me the jackass.

20:51.421 --> 20:53.549
This was all a big lie
so you could eliminate me?

20:53.632 --> 20:55.440
No. I meant what I said
about being ready.

20:55.523 --> 20:58.745
Go spin your web of lies
somewhere else, black widow.

20:58.828 --> 21:01.149
Or should I say, The Jackal!

21:01.829 --> 21:02.725
Again!

21:08.595 --> 21:10.977
And Katherine's like, "That's why
we shouldn't be doing this

21:11.145 --> 21:12.461
exercise. Moving on."

21:13.230 --> 21:15.982
You know what I should have said?
"Maybe if the girls in your house

21:16.150 --> 21:18.290
exercised, it wouldn't be
so embarrassing."

21:19.476 --> 21:21.279
- Right for the jugular.
- Yes.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.222
If you had said it.

21:24.944 --> 21:28.445
Docking blue ribbon points
because we're hot is totally sexist.

21:28.528 --> 21:30.288
Keep looking.
We need to find a way

21:30.371 --> 21:32.947
to override the Pan-hellenic
board's vote on the Undie Run.

21:33.030 --> 21:35.141
The undie run is about freedom.

21:35.442 --> 21:38.116
It's about america and stuff.

21:38.429 --> 21:41.917
Which is perfect because I've the cutest
american flag underwear for the run.

21:43.024 --> 21:43.943
Or had.

21:45.261 --> 21:48.449
If Harry Potter can flash
his wand inequus,

21:48.532 --> 21:50.900
We should be able to show off
our undies without punishment.

21:50.983 --> 21:52.935
Not to mention, we're seniors.

21:53.263 --> 21:55.897
When else are we gonna run around
in public in our underwear?

21:56.065 --> 21:58.524
- They're bringing back lilith fair.
- Here we go.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.740
We can override the board's decision
with a petition

22:00.823 --> 22:03.154
that has 500 sorority signatures.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.782
Yeah. How are we gonna get
500 signatures by tomorrow?

22:07.624 --> 22:11.162
Katherine may have brains
and the support of Pan-hellenic

22:11.330 --> 22:12.958
and a really, really nice laptop,

22:13.303 --> 22:14.698
but I have a plan.

22:27.391 --> 22:28.459
I need a favor.

22:28.866 --> 22:29.597
Really?

22:30.227 --> 22:32.847
We've been ignoring each other
for the past six months,

22:32.930 --> 22:34.310
and now you tell me that?

22:34.816 --> 22:37.104
- I think it's the least you can do.
- Interesting.

22:37.996 --> 22:39.524
I should care what you think, why?

22:40.153 --> 22:41.859
You cared enough to buy off my ex.

22:42.533 --> 22:45.688
- Nice pull, Case. Door's that way.
- OK, that was uncalled for.

22:46.964 --> 22:49.369
This isn't about us.
It's about the Undie Run.

22:50.009 --> 22:53.734
Which sounds ridiculous that I'm even
saying it with that much importance, but

22:54.198 --> 22:55.957
I know most sororities
want to do it.

22:58.063 --> 23:00.687
A mob of half-naked sority girls?

23:01.895 --> 23:03.506
Pretty sure we can get behind that.

23:04.184 --> 23:06.384
Have you been hanging out
with Cappie or something?

23:06.969 --> 23:07.616
No.

23:09.276 --> 23:10.135
Come on.

23:10.919 --> 23:12.673
So, what do you need me to do?

23:13.239 --> 23:15.852
Put down your fork
and take off your clothes.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.557
Save the Undie Run.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.310
Save the Undie Run for the sorority.

23:26.570 --> 23:28.109
Save the Undie Run. Thank you.

23:28.303 --> 23:29.669
Save the Undie Run.

23:32.730 --> 23:34.915
You're literally down to
your last pair of shorts.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.373
Are you looking for more work?

23:38.769 --> 23:40.758
Do you need another fake boyfriend?

23:41.818 --> 23:44.380
Actually, you're the closest thing
to a friend I have left.

23:44.727 --> 23:47.467
Pretty much the whole house
is mad at me for what I did to Ashleigh.

23:47.635 --> 23:48.403
And...

23:49.218 --> 23:50.795
Maybe they have a point.

23:52.436 --> 23:54.856
- But I'm working on it.
- We all make mistakes.

23:55.753 --> 23:57.977
Move along, Becks.
We need signatures.

23:58.754 --> 24:00.671
- Later, rich kid.
- Yeah, see ya.

24:02.537 --> 24:04.692
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.430
I'm just here for the cause.

24:18.903 --> 24:21.646
- Status report.
- Chicken legs is safe and secure, Sir.

24:21.729 --> 24:24.834
- But he looks a little melancholy. Sir!
- Thank you, pledge.

24:32.688 --> 24:33.678
Melancholy?

24:33.849 --> 24:36.139
How could I not know
my own girlfriend was the jackal?

24:36.222 --> 24:37.624
We figured it out in time.

24:37.982 --> 24:40.561
The important thing now is that
you two are the last ones standing.

24:40.729 --> 24:42.438
You need to do her
before she does you.

24:43.384 --> 24:44.732
With your weapon, I mean.

24:45.954 --> 24:47.944
That shoots. Darts.

24:48.112 --> 24:49.233
- I got it.
- OK.

24:49.851 --> 24:52.071
You date someone,
you think you know them,

24:52.154 --> 24:53.576
but it turns out you don't.

24:53.733 --> 24:57.410
And conveniently, it's easier to shoot
a total stranger than someone you know.

24:59.575 --> 25:00.343
Maybe.

25:01.311 --> 25:03.084
Because some people are hunters

25:04.113 --> 25:05.841
and some people are gathers.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.752
Now, which people are you?

25:10.365 --> 25:11.259
A hunter.

25:11.427 --> 25:13.302
A mean hunter.
And what do you hunt?

25:14.290 --> 25:15.930
- Jackals.
- That's right.

25:16.394 --> 25:18.391
Spitters hunt jackals.

25:19.245 --> 25:20.493
So, what do we need?

25:24.716 --> 25:25.467
Guns.

25:26.282 --> 25:27.358
Lots of guns.

25:32.776 --> 25:35.443
Spitter, no KT has ever done
anything like this before.

25:35.526 --> 25:36.384
I know.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.628
That's why it's gonna work.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.774
I couldn't have asked
for a better first date.

25:46.857 --> 25:50.768
Well, the 60-mile drive wasn't ideal,
but the company is.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.133
So how about dessert?

25:53.635 --> 25:55.865
On the house.
I told 'em it was your birthday.

25:55.948 --> 25:59.080
<i>It's your birthday
it happens once a year</i>

25:59.481 --> 26:02.730
It's your birthday
it's time for lots of cheer

26:02.855 --> 26:06.254
it's your birthday
enjoy your special day

26:06.607 --> 26:10.000
it's your birthday
so be happy and be gay

26:10.202 --> 26:11.658
happy birthday.

26:20.598 --> 26:21.745
And grant?

26:27.950 --> 26:30.128
I'd blow out my candle,
but I can't breathe.

26:34.556 --> 26:36.927
<i>Chicken legs one, you ready to rock?</i>

26:37.372 --> 26:39.832
Like a baby in a treetop.

26:40.755 --> 26:43.037
<i>You got a green light on the jackal.</i>

26:52.524 --> 26:54.246
Taking my shot.

26:55.390 --> 26:56.798
What was that?

26:57.908 --> 27:00.273
<i>- Damn!
- Get her, Rus! Fire! Fire!</i>

27:00.398 --> 27:02.430
Ambush! Get behind the bench!

27:09.748 --> 27:11.344
Wanna party?

27:20.817 --> 27:22.296
I'm out!

27:22.799 --> 27:24.330
<i>Did you get her?</i>

27:28.272 --> 27:29.855
He's out of darts.

27:36.238 --> 27:38.416
Barf. Let's boogie.

27:42.671 --> 27:44.558
Did you even open your eyes?

27:44.683 --> 27:46.457
Is the bluetooth necessary?

27:51.629 --> 27:54.259
- What's this?
- Six-hundred and 88 signatures

27:54.384 --> 27:56.644
overriding your vote to bar
sororities from the undie run.

27:56.769 --> 27:58.551
No matter what you think,
people want this.

27:58.719 --> 28:00.954
You can check the signatures
for authenticity if you want.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.498
No need.

28:02.623 --> 28:05.099
It would probably take a long
time since there's so many.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.412
I guess you got what you wanted.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.428
It's not just what I wanted.

28:09.553 --> 28:11.772
It's what everyone
who signed my petion wants.

28:12.090 --> 28:15.123
Some college kids want to do
drugs, but that doesn't mean

28:15.248 --> 28:16.835
we should sponsor it, should we?

28:16.960 --> 28:18.683
You're comparing drugs to underwear?

28:18.808 --> 28:21.474
Absolutely. They both give sorities
a bad name.

28:21.599 --> 28:24.074
Watch. They're gonna broadcast
the run on some tv show,

28:24.199 --> 28:26.193
we're all gonna look whorish.
But moving on...

28:26.318 --> 28:28.289
You just can't accept that I won.

28:30.450 --> 28:33.905
If winning means staking
your reputation on some

28:34.030 --> 28:36.157
stupid and meaningless event
that reinforces

28:36.282 --> 28:38.941
every negative stereotype
about the greek system,

28:39.066 --> 28:41.802
then yes, I guess you won.

28:42.096 --> 28:43.874
People will think what they think.

28:43.999 --> 28:45.639
An undie run won't change that.

28:45.967 --> 28:47.370
But it won't help.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.624
The sad part is we were all
wondering what Casey Cartwright,

28:51.749 --> 28:55.096
former zbz president and congressional
intern, was gonna do next.

28:55.724 --> 28:56.936
And now we know.

28:57.473 --> 28:58.922
It's underpants.

29:00.100 --> 29:03.216
So congratulations on your
return to politics, zbz.

29:03.715 --> 29:05.160
You should be proud.

29:27.517 --> 29:29.141
Tell me about your cheesecake?

29:32.527 --> 29:36.354
I'd love to, Cal, but I got fired

29:36.628 --> 29:39.660
for not singing you
happy birthday properly.

29:44.751 --> 29:46.476
I gave up my trust fund.

29:46.798 --> 29:50.174
My parents cut me off,
and now I'm flat broke.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.197
And that's it.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.707
That's my secret,

29:56.874 --> 29:59.634
- what about yours?
- OK. Look, don't worry.

29:59.759 --> 30:03.362
We're not gonna fly a rainbow
flag off the house or anything.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.176
Grant's not even out yet,

30:05.442 --> 30:08.221
which is sort of
why we went a town over.

30:08.512 --> 30:10.266
I didn't even know he was in.

30:11.265 --> 30:15.164
How long have you guys
been... Doing it?

30:16.023 --> 30:18.142
Believe it or not,

30:18.267 --> 30:22.127
gay relationships are more than just...
You know?

30:22.252 --> 30:23.729
Right.

30:23.854 --> 30:25.948
There's real feelings and emotions,

30:26.241 --> 30:29.653
so I'm trying to find those
before the other stuff.

30:29.890 --> 30:31.147
I get that.

30:31.998 --> 30:35.841
But why can't you guys
just date in your room?

30:36.661 --> 30:38.478
Swat raid! Everybody down!

30:40.176 --> 30:41.501
Look at your faces!

30:43.963 --> 30:45.072
I see.

30:50.038 --> 30:52.183
How's it feel to be a hero?

30:52.351 --> 30:54.769
Not as heroic as I expected.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.561
No, don't do the
wholedark knightthing,

30:56.686 --> 30:59.196
where you've saved the world
but you're all angsty in the end.

30:59.321 --> 31:02.679
It's fine. It's just
something Katherine said to me.

31:02.804 --> 31:06.017
Maybe the undie run
isn't the best message.

31:06.366 --> 31:08.729
It's not supposed to be a message.
It's supposed to be fun.

31:08.854 --> 31:11.784
- Why are you doubting this?
- With Katherine,

31:12.074 --> 31:14.853
this feels
like Washington all over again.

31:14.978 --> 31:16.456
I think she thinks i'm elle woods.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.587
Who cares what Katherine thinks?

31:19.658 --> 31:22.391
- It's a huge victory, right?
- Yes. For us

31:22.516 --> 31:23.908
and the economy.

31:24.426 --> 31:27.464
You single-handedly stimulated
the local undergarment industry.

31:27.706 --> 31:29.879
- Obama can't say that.
- Exactly.

31:30.004 --> 31:31.757
I don't need Katherine's approval.

31:31.882 --> 31:33.798
It's your senior year.

31:34.302 --> 31:37.152
If pan-hellenic's so annoying,
just screw it.

31:37.277 --> 31:39.020
Drop out and I'll put Laura back.

31:39.190 --> 31:42.204
You know what? You're right.
Pan-hellenic can bite me.

31:45.556 --> 31:47.374
I'm glad you're here.

31:47.499 --> 31:49.156
We need to figure this out.

31:49.653 --> 31:52.125
It was smart of Rebecca
to set us up like this.

31:52.441 --> 31:55.284
Stop acting like I'm
some stranger on a blind date.

31:55.409 --> 31:58.242
- You tried to shoot me, too.
- Which is why it is important

31:58.367 --> 32:02.246
to settle this diplomatically...
Jackal.

32:02.546 --> 32:04.894
I just want to be alone with you.

32:06.348 --> 32:08.054
I was thinking the same thing.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.601
Enough of the mushy crap.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.885
Rusty, just give up.
You're never gonna kill Jordan.

32:14.010 --> 32:16.486
You're like dick cheney,
and she's a quail.

32:16.611 --> 32:20.269
OK, maybe Spitter can't shoot her
but he can outlive her.

32:20.394 --> 32:23.253
We'll just move him into the kt
house until this is all over.

32:23.378 --> 32:24.817
He could be there forever.

32:25.276 --> 32:28.022
Or, you know, at least
until he graduates.

32:28.489 --> 32:29.982
Wait a minute.

32:30.323 --> 32:32.520
- I want to be with her.
- She went after you, Rus.

32:32.645 --> 32:35.033
Don't be Rihanna.
Don't be that girl.

32:35.287 --> 32:38.056
- I want to be with you, too.
- You want to sleep with Rusty?

32:38.181 --> 32:40.249
You should turn
that toy gun on yourself.

32:40.418 --> 32:42.441
- I refuse to fight any longer.
- Yeah. Me, too.

32:42.753 --> 32:44.146
You know what? I'm sorry

32:44.271 --> 32:46.480
but I'm placing
you in protective custody. Let's go.

32:46.605 --> 32:47.782
Wait!

32:49.316 --> 32:50.943
- Barf.
- Barf!

32:56.314 --> 32:57.822
Hold that, please.

33:00.813 --> 33:01.934
Thanks.

33:09.414 --> 33:11.656
Nice work saving the undie run.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.494
Some people didn't think so.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.868
That's why
i'm quitting pan-hellenic.

33:16.036 --> 33:17.158
Really?

33:18.293 --> 33:19.955
I thought that suited you.

33:21.860 --> 33:25.345
My big victory is a dash
across campus virtually naked.

33:25.470 --> 33:26.629
I liked it.

33:30.170 --> 33:31.822
But Katherine doesn't.

33:31.947 --> 33:33.414
And she's right.

33:33.539 --> 33:37.206
But how do you
make something meaningful

33:37.331 --> 33:39.945
out of a bunch of people
running around without clothes?

33:46.182 --> 33:47.590
You coming?

33:55.651 --> 33:57.920
I made your favorite, Rus.

33:58.638 --> 34:00.633
Grilled cheese and spam.

34:09.172 --> 34:11.237
Lock down! Lock down!

34:11.362 --> 34:13.389
Chicken legs one has flown the coop!

35:01.392 --> 35:03.346
I thought we could try this again.

35:03.589 --> 35:07.437
No schedule, no dads, no bodyguards.

35:07.760 --> 35:09.400
Just the two of us.

35:10.141 --> 35:11.607
One question:

35:11.997 --> 35:14.356
we're definitely not
playing the game, right?

35:15.847 --> 35:18.741
No. Why, are you?

35:19.193 --> 35:21.445
No. Are you?

35:23.328 --> 35:24.989
Wanna frisk me?

35:25.114 --> 35:26.582
I just said I trust you.

35:30.612 --> 35:32.503
Let me grab some forks.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.887
- Two forks.
- Yeah.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.937
They go great with food.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.763
That reminds me.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.450
A candle.

35:51.901 --> 35:54.374
I thought a little ambient
lighting would be nice.

36:03.665 --> 36:05.161
You seem nervous.

36:05.694 --> 36:08.070
Not really. If you could just

36:08.195 --> 36:10.655
stop with the sudden moves.

36:10.961 --> 36:13.749
If you kept your hands where I can't
see them, I wouldn't have to.

36:14.260 --> 36:16.009
I'm not doing anything.

36:17.699 --> 36:20.269
Oh, my god, you're still playing.

36:20.887 --> 36:22.970
Only because you are.

36:23.170 --> 36:25.224
- You didn't deny it!
- Neither did you!

36:25.781 --> 36:27.419
I knew it!

36:31.605 --> 36:33.040
Rug burn!

36:37.499 --> 36:40.083
This is so stupid!
I just want to be with you.

36:41.120 --> 36:43.282
Throw down your gun and come out.

36:43.626 --> 36:45.858
Why should I throw down mine?
You throw down yours.

37:12.732 --> 37:13.867
What's going on?

37:13.992 --> 37:16.119
Evan had some stuff stolen
from his room.

37:16.244 --> 37:18.360
So he's having new locks
put on all the doors.

37:18.911 --> 37:22.321
Off of one break-in
that I've never heard of.

37:22.963 --> 37:24.782
He wants us to be safe.

37:27.598 --> 37:29.630
So maybe later we could watch,

37:31.120 --> 37:34.892
- Kate & Leopold?
- Yeah, we're still not watching that.

37:37.116 --> 37:39.039
A little something
for the run, ladies.

37:39.164 --> 37:40.902
To keep you energized.

37:41.982 --> 37:44.303
OK, enough.

37:46.715 --> 37:48.929
Enough what?
I'm just trying to be nice.

37:49.316 --> 37:52.409
- I even shaved for you.
- Stop! Stop being nice.

37:52.534 --> 37:54.584
No matter what I do,
you're still here.

37:54.709 --> 37:57.061
- Why haven't you just quit?
- I'm not giving up.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.007
Only because I have
to carbo-load for the run.

38:09.466 --> 38:12.743
Everybody, keep your clothes on!

38:13.882 --> 38:15.372
Not again!

38:24.570 --> 38:26.964
I guess all we needed were guns

38:27.089 --> 38:30.269
and betrayal to get
over the hump hump.

38:34.052 --> 38:36.171
I'm disappointed, though.

38:37.307 --> 38:38.724
Really?

38:39.768 --> 38:42.449
- Oh, no. That was great.
- Thank god.

38:43.480 --> 38:45.311
It's the game.

38:45.923 --> 38:47.563
I'm sad it's over.

38:47.688 --> 38:49.299
It was kind of fun.

38:49.424 --> 38:51.369
- It's not over.
- It is now,

38:51.548 --> 38:52.900
sucker!

38:54.054 --> 38:55.542
Zbz wins.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.498
You're not mad, are you?

38:58.386 --> 39:01.295
Your dad could walk in
and I could not care less.

39:02.253 --> 39:05.032
<i>Chicken legs one,
are you in there? Are you alive?</i>

39:06.641 --> 39:08.736
No, I'm dead and I'm loving it.

39:08.861 --> 39:10.334
Go away!

39:12.917 --> 39:15.349
You wanna do it again, jackal?

39:15.474 --> 39:18.312
Yes... Chicken legs one.

39:19.583 --> 39:23.033
Pop quiz, hotshot.
Which is better: having sex

39:23.158 --> 39:26.670
with Jordan or shooting her and
winning beer money for your brothers?

39:28.629 --> 39:31.363
If she had a square jaw and biceps.

39:32.050 --> 39:34.647
I know. We haven't had
a debate this lively since

39:34.772 --> 39:37.107
"what's the difference between
a chipmunk and a squirrel?"

39:37.232 --> 39:38.628
Remember?

39:39.414 --> 39:41.836
Oh, my god! We won gotcha!

39:43.425 --> 39:45.368
Oh, my god!
How did that happen?

39:45.493 --> 39:47.552
Thanks to me keeping
Jordan alive all week,

39:47.677 --> 39:50.096
she was able to
shoot Rusty and then they...

39:51.740 --> 39:53.824
Never mind. We won!

39:54.730 --> 39:57.060
This'll totally help us
with greek blue ribbon.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.396
Does this also help you
with my "nameless slut" thing?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.921
Not at all, you.

40:06.652 --> 40:10.521
Thank you, everyone, for
coming out to support our cru titans!

40:14.045 --> 40:16.922
But before we show off

Ifc and pan-hellenic council,

40:26.521 --> 40:28.460
thank you for your support.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.449
- Congratulations, zbz.
- Thank you.

40:39.574 --> 40:40.936
Are you happy now?

40:41.106 --> 40:42.781
Does it matter to you how I feel?

40:42.906 --> 40:45.432
- I guess not.
- Then why ask?

40:47.018 --> 40:48.863
It's good for everyone.

40:48.988 --> 40:50.551
It's good for the homeless.

40:50.676 --> 40:52.865
And it's a good start for you.

40:54.021 --> 40:56.029
So do you wanna...?

40:56.727 --> 40:58.868
Yeah, no. I'm not doing that.

41:04.817 --> 41:06.687
You did it! And it's all important.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.051
- I guess everything turned out OK.
- Better than OK.

41:10.344 --> 41:13.219
Jessica L. said she'd take
over pan-hellenic now that you've quit.

41:13.415 --> 41:14.893
I'm not quitting.

41:15.331 --> 41:17.176
I'm just getting started.

41:17.892 --> 41:19.468
OK, then.

41:21.128 --> 41:22.497
OK, everybody!

41:22.772 --> 41:25.945
<i>We're a couple of minutes away
from the 61st annual...</i>

41:28.962 --> 41:30.865
You're looking undie-tastic, case.

41:31.768 --> 41:34.337
Nice to see you
kicking ass on pan-hellenic.

41:35.368 --> 41:36.701
Watch out, world.

41:37.040 --> 41:39.881
And you watch out for manholes.

41:40.901 --> 41:42.745
Manholes?

41:43.793 --> 41:47.255
<i>Remember ladies, keep your hands to
yourself unless you're running past me.</i>

41:51.513 --> 41:53.063
On your mark.

41:53.347 --> 41:54.886
Get set.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
