WEBVTT

00:01.595 --> 00:03.961
Ahhh...
Oh man, is this great?

00:04.081 --> 00:05.951
- No Archer, it's...
- Was that a rhetorical question?

00:06.071 --> 00:07.812
- Archer... Archer!
- And also was that?

00:07.932 --> 00:11.736
Answer, yes, they both were, because
New Orleans is my kind of town,

00:11.856 --> 00:13.840
and I haven't had a
vacation in forever.

00:13.908 --> 00:15.809
- LANA Well, that's great but...
- Nola!

00:15.876 --> 00:17.043
The Crescents City!

00:17.111 --> 00:21.614
- The Big Easy... - Our mission is to
stop an eco-terrorist

00:21.682 --> 00:24.696
from blowing up the biggest natural gas
pipeline in North America,

00:24.816 --> 00:27.211
so I wouldn't exactly
call it a vacation.

00:27.331 --> 00:29.322
Well whatever,
working vacation.

00:29.390 --> 00:33.159
Cause I'm not too worried about some
drum-circling hippie tree-hugger.

00:33.227 --> 00:35.462
Sir, can you
find your seat for me?

00:35.529 --> 00:36.596
Yeah it's right there.

00:36.664 --> 00:39.499
Can you go find some
more hurricanes for me?

00:39.567 --> 00:42.495
Hippies aren't the only people
who care about the environment.

00:42.615 --> 00:44.974
Like, I happen to care.
A lot.

00:45.094 --> 00:48.058
And so does our target Joshua Gray,
aka Gandalf.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.176
His name's Gandalf?
And he's not a hippie?

00:50.244 --> 00:53.142
Gray's an ex-Green Beret,
and he's attacked nuclear power plants

00:53.262 --> 00:55.191
hydro-electric dams, wailing ships...

00:55.311 --> 00:58.360
Wailing ships? What?
He's against clean-burning lamp oil?

00:58.480 --> 00:59.654
Would you relax?

00:59.774 --> 01:03.523
We know he's gonna try to attack the
pipeline, and we know where the pipeline is...

01:03.643 --> 01:06.274
Yeah, running through
a couple hundred miles of marshy wetlands.

01:06.394 --> 01:08.165
So mobility will be key, Lana.

01:08.285 --> 01:11.392
And how will we achieve mobility?
Huh?

01:11.512 --> 01:13.796
An airboat, Lana!

01:13.916 --> 01:16.100
Just like Burt Reynolds
in "White Lightning"!

01:16.220 --> 01:18.251
- Great, just...
- Not to mention "Gator"!

01:18.371 --> 01:21.708
Which, even though it's the sequel, I think
is actually the stronger of the two films.

01:21.776 --> 01:23.583
Just try to keep a low profile.

01:23.703 --> 01:26.356
We could scare off Gray if we don't
maintain the element of surprise.

01:26.476 --> 01:28.348
Hey here's a surprise:

01:28.416 --> 01:29.482
This is Hermès.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.772
Ooh, and here's another one.

01:30.892 --> 01:32.921
- Remember Jerry Reed's character in Gator?
- No.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.406
Bama McCall?

01:35.122 --> 01:35.989
No.

01:36.056 --> 01:37.757
Well whatever,
check this out. I stuh...

01:37.825 --> 01:39.058
borrowed it from Woodhouse.

01:39.126 --> 01:40.356
Archer, what the shit?!

01:40.476 --> 01:43.546
- Right? It's just like in Gator...
- Gun! Gun!

01:43.666 --> 01:44.831
Drop it, drop it!

01:44.899 --> 01:45.932
You drop it!

01:46.000 --> 01:46.833
Lana, hijacking!

01:46.901 --> 01:48.420
Dammit, it's not a...

01:49.585 --> 01:51.647
Oh great,
there better be more of those!

01:51.767 --> 01:53.840
Sky marshal!
Drop your weapon!

01:53.908 --> 01:56.843
- Oh! Okay relax, it's okay, we're...
- Dut dut dut dut dut!

01:56.911 --> 02:00.847
Sterling Archer and Lana Kane
of ISIS, and we're on a mission to stop

02:00.915 --> 02:04.617
an eco-terrorist from
blowing up a gas pipeline!

02:04.685 --> 02:08.955
So for the love of God, woman, go
make me a fresh batch of hurricanes!

02:09.023 --> 02:10.023
Great.

02:10.090 --> 02:11.290
Way to keep a low profile.

02:11.410 --> 02:12.826
Thanks.

02:48.793 --> 02:53.496
This is the AmPetCo gas pipeline...
Runs right underneath these

02:53.564 --> 02:58.301
swamps, supplyin' almost twenty percent
of America's liquid natural gas demand.

02:58.369 --> 03:00.570
- Right...
- But there's a pig launcher here...

03:00.638 --> 03:01.938
Is that what it sounds like?

03:02.006 --> 03:04.674
It's a pipe inspection
gauge, for cleaning the pipeline.

03:04.742 --> 03:09.145
It's the only section above ground, so
if Gray wants to attack our pipeline...

03:09.213 --> 03:10.947
He'll have to do it there.

03:11.015 --> 03:13.516
So we'll set up a defensive
perimeter at the launcher,

03:13.584 --> 03:15.051
and catch him when he tries.

03:15.119 --> 03:17.654
Well wait, hang on a second...
Can I get the oyster

03:17.721 --> 03:20.623
po'boy and just like, a
side of crawfish étouffee?

03:20.691 --> 03:21.778
Cause I'm not sure
if I'll like it.

03:21.898 --> 03:22.512
Archer.

03:22.632 --> 03:23.959
No? Just an entree?
Okay.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.760
Oh, so the po'boy...Hello?

03:27.565 --> 03:30.667
- Wow, speaking of disastrous...
- Speaking of shut up,

03:30.734 --> 03:33.002
think about what will happen to
those fragile wetlands if that

03:33.070 --> 03:34.103
pipeline explodes!

03:34.171 --> 03:38.808
Screw the damn swamps, think
what'll happen to AmPetCo's profit margin!

03:38.876 --> 03:40.677
- What?
- Big money.

03:40.744 --> 03:43.680
Huge tax credits from that
hippie Democrat congress,

03:43.747 --> 03:46.249
just for making a few
simple changes around here.

03:46.317 --> 03:48.451
Well, a lot of
these aren't so simple.

03:48.519 --> 03:51.421
Replacing all the lights with
high efficiency fluorescents,

03:51.489 --> 03:53.578
putting lowflow fixtures
on all the plumbing...

03:53.698 --> 03:55.022
Recycling old batteries?!

03:55.142 --> 03:57.211
Exactly, don't
we do that already?

03:57.331 --> 03:58.237
Umm...

04:06.354 --> 04:08.152
- Prrretty much...
- Good.

04:08.272 --> 04:10.206
Because I'm not leaving
money on the table.

04:10.274 --> 04:14.977
So to get these freebie socialist tax
credits, we are going to make this place

04:15.097 --> 04:17.146
lean and green.

04:17.214 --> 04:21.618
Typical corporate bullshit Thirty
acres of wetlands disappear every day,

04:21.685 --> 04:24.721
but all you care about is how much
natural gas you can pump out!

04:24.788 --> 04:26.723
Hey, we're just
supplying a demand.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.892
Yeah, AmPetCo's
demand for huge profits!

04:28.959 --> 04:31.528
Well, some of those
huge profits are paying ISIS to

04:31.595 --> 04:35.088
- protect that pipeline...
- Which I'm only doing for the wetlands...

04:35.208 --> 04:38.272
- Wetlands, profits, whatever...
- Yeah, sounds like a win-win...

04:38.392 --> 04:39.973
Just get out
there and do your job!

04:40.093 --> 04:41.132
Yeah I will!

04:41.252 --> 04:42.867
If you will excuse me!

04:46.911 --> 04:48.978
I should go with her.

04:49.046 --> 04:51.581
I don't think room
service is coming.

04:51.649 --> 04:53.750
Shoulda called first...
Cause dat's the only airboat

04:53.817 --> 04:55.985
around for fifty miles,
and it's reserved.

04:56.053 --> 04:57.854
What do you mean it's reserved?

04:57.922 --> 04:59.489
Is dat not self-explanatory?

04:59.557 --> 05:01.297
Look, this is kind of an emergency.

05:01.417 --> 05:03.004
- Can we work something out?
- Maybe.

05:03.042 --> 05:05.008
Maybe use that money to buy a time machine,

05:05.128 --> 05:06.710
go back
in time, and be the first person

05:06.830 --> 05:07.830
to reserve dat boat.

05:07.898 --> 05:08.974
You sure about that?

05:09.094 --> 05:09.927
- Yup.
- Good.

05:10.047 --> 05:13.268
Cause I've waited my entire life
to say this exact phrase...

05:13.388 --> 05:16.523
I'm commandeering this airboat.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.174
Sorry!

05:18.242 --> 05:19.842
It really is an emergency!

05:19.910 --> 05:23.130
Of an awesome
and asskicky nature.

05:24.097 --> 05:26.642
And some damn guard dog you is!

05:27.239 --> 05:30.787
Annie! Annie?

05:30.854 --> 05:32.789
Aw, well that's just great.

05:32.856 --> 05:35.565
Now both my dogs is dead!

05:38.429 --> 05:41.067
Stupid efficient
Canadian lightbulbs.

05:41.187 --> 05:42.832
I can barely even
see what I'm doing.

05:42.900 --> 05:43.866
What arya doin?

05:43.934 --> 05:45.204
I need six more of these.

05:45.324 --> 05:46.457
Why do you need seven?

05:46.577 --> 05:48.905
One for each cat, duh!

05:48.973 --> 05:50.773
For God's sake, Pam!

05:50.841 --> 05:52.775
Have you no sense of decency?!

05:52.843 --> 05:55.111
That bathroom's like
a, a war crime!

05:55.179 --> 05:58.014
Don't blame me, it's
those new lowflow toilets!

05:58.082 --> 06:01.084
With the old ones you could
flush a dachsund puppy!

06:01.151 --> 06:03.853
I mean, not that you would, but
Well next time use the...

06:03.921 --> 06:04.787
Dut dut dut dut!

06:04.855 --> 06:06.042
Women's restroom!

06:09.128 --> 06:10.548
The what?

06:10.668 --> 06:11.927
Thanks, Cyril.

06:18.656 --> 06:21.752
Woooo! Seriously Lana, this must
be what it's like to have sex with me!

06:21.872 --> 06:23.806
How can an airboat be selfish?

06:23.874 --> 06:25.608
Nope!
Can't hear you, I'm too happy!

06:25.676 --> 06:28.444
You can't hear me because
you're redlining the engine!

06:28.512 --> 06:30.947
Thank you, certified
airboat mechanic!

06:31.015 --> 06:32.882
Now where's the pig
launcher thing?

06:32.950 --> 06:34.050
This heading, one mile!

06:34.118 --> 06:37.787
- But I'm serious, if you don't slow down...
- I'll keep feeling this

06:37.855 --> 06:39.489
incredibly vibrant and alive!

06:39.556 --> 06:41.069
Yeah, right up until you blow
the damn engine, so...

06:41.189 --> 06:42.193
Lana!

06:42.313 --> 06:44.965
I am not... gonna blow...

07:04.186 --> 07:07.869
Try clearing your throat about a jillion
more times, Lana, see if that helps.

07:10.357 --> 07:11.167
No?

07:11.644 --> 07:12.753
Nothing?

07:17.998 --> 07:21.296
No no, by all means,
let me do it...

07:21.416 --> 07:23.380
You just sit there like
the African Queen.

07:23.448 --> 07:25.149
The African Queen was the boat.

07:25.216 --> 07:26.895
- What? No it wasn't, it was Audrey...
- Katherine.

07:27.015 --> 07:28.900
Whichever Hepburn,
she was the queen.

07:31.069 --> 07:31.955
Of Africa.

07:32.023 --> 07:32.923
Yeah.

07:32.991 --> 07:35.626
The white queen of Africa.

07:35.693 --> 07:38.395
Yeah, back then Hollywood was
pretty weird about the whole race

07:38.463 --> 07:42.833
thing... Like, Amos and Andy were white,
a white guy played Charlie Chan...

07:42.901 --> 07:45.098
- Archer... - Pretty sure Tonto was a Jew...
- Stop!

07:45.218 --> 07:46.534
What? ! Gator?!

07:46.654 --> 07:47.771
- Gator?
- Talking!

07:47.891 --> 07:49.606
But I wish there was a gator!

07:49.674 --> 07:51.775
Hey c'mon, not even as a joke.

07:51.843 --> 07:53.699
- It so wasn't.
- Look, I said I was sorry!

07:53.819 --> 07:56.212
Tell all this wildlife
you're sorry when the pipeline

07:56.332 --> 07:58.215
blows up because we're
not there to protect it!

07:58.283 --> 08:00.717
A, all this
wildlife can suck it!

08:00.785 --> 08:03.882
Every thing out here either wants
to eat me or give me malaria!

08:04.002 --> 08:05.036
And B...

08:06.870 --> 08:08.606
No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.

08:08.726 --> 08:11.197
Would you, just...

08:12.022 --> 08:14.282
Okay, let's set up a defensive perimeter.

08:14.402 --> 08:15.666
Yeah, right after
I set up the grill.

08:15.733 --> 08:17.634
- Dammit Archer, will you...
- Hey! I just dragged this

08:17.702 --> 08:19.937
damn boat through a mile
of my three biggest fears,

08:20.004 --> 08:22.372
so I think I've earned a kabob!

08:22.440 --> 08:23.574
Well, too bad!

08:23.641 --> 08:27.377
Your lab uses more electricity than
the rest of ISIS put together.

08:27.445 --> 08:29.125
Yes, and I need
every single watt!

08:29.245 --> 08:30.057
- No!
- But, but I need...

08:30.177 --> 08:32.491
We all have to pitch in
to make ISIS green.

08:32.611 --> 08:35.176
Loot at me,
chopping ice for a Tom Collins

08:35.220 --> 08:36.453
like a field hand.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.121
- But...
- Ooh, or do I want a mint julep?

08:39.190 --> 08:40.791
But the slightest
reduction of power to my lab

08:40.859 --> 08:42.159
could put lives at risk!

08:42.227 --> 08:44.484
Lives of what, a few lab rats?

08:52.111 --> 08:53.988
Also, yes.

08:54.439 --> 08:57.307
Yeah, good, great idea...
Do the one thing that

08:57.375 --> 08:58.709
could possibly make it hotter.

08:58.776 --> 09:01.044
Ya gotta sear 'em first,
it locks in the flavor.

09:01.112 --> 09:03.981
And if you're hot, and also
somewhat bitchy, drink a beer.

09:04.048 --> 09:06.783
I don't want a
beer, I want water.

09:06.851 --> 09:07.718
Your funeral.

09:07.785 --> 09:09.786
God knows what kinda parasites
are swimming around in it.

09:09.854 --> 09:13.090
Not swamp water, ass, bottled!

09:13.157 --> 09:15.859
- Oh you are shitting me...
- I know, right?

09:15.927 --> 09:18.762
A rainbow should shoot out
every time you open it.

09:18.830 --> 09:20.330
You didn't bring any water?!

09:20.398 --> 09:21.243
Where would I have put it?

09:21.363 --> 09:24.414
Great, I'll just wait half
an hour for a cup of ice to melt.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.444
- Dut dut dut dutm dut.
- Oww, shit!

09:26.564 --> 09:28.221
What the [BEEP] shit is this?

09:28.341 --> 09:31.156
No, no, no, Lana.
It's dry ice!

09:36.919 --> 09:39.003
Hurry, put your
hands in the swamp!

09:39.123 --> 09:40.733
Rrrgh!

09:46.591 --> 09:48.033
How ya doin, buddy?

09:49.827 --> 09:53.444
Because dry ice is something crazy
like, negative a hundred degrees...

09:53.564 --> 09:56.156
I need you, to not talk to me.

09:56.276 --> 09:59.770
I know, and I know you're in a
lot of pain, so just try to relax...

09:59.837 --> 10:02.406
Why are you still talk... ow!

10:02.473 --> 10:03.907
And say hi to Sister Morphine.

10:03.975 --> 10:04.708
Morphine?!

10:04.776 --> 10:06.709
Dammit, I don't... need...
That actually feels waaaay better.

10:06.948 --> 10:08.128
- Yeah?
- Yeahhhh...

10:08.248 --> 10:09.876
That actually feels better.

10:09.996 --> 10:12.015
Good, then get up.
You're sitting on the beer.

10:13.734 --> 10:15.420
Alright, so wait a second.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.120
What're your
three biggest fears?

10:17.188 --> 10:17.788
Nope.

10:17.855 --> 10:19.930
- C'mon...
- No, hush, I'm trying to fish.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.220
No, don't shoot the fish.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.323
C'mon, this is a very
fragile ecosystem.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.425
Too fragile to spare one trout?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.720
No, but... Or bass
or whatever, what's in here?

10:27.840 --> 10:31.097
Nothing soon, if people like
you keep destroying the environment.

10:31.165 --> 10:32.794
Wh-?!
It's one lousy fish!

10:32.914 --> 10:35.694
One lousy black rhino,
one lousy Bengal tiger...

10:35.814 --> 10:37.343
One lousy Lorax!

10:37.463 --> 10:39.539
Since when are you such a
radical environmentalist?

10:39.606 --> 10:41.107
I'm not radical.

10:41.175 --> 10:42.542
Well, I mean not anymore.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.671
Back in the day, though...

10:44.791 --> 10:46.377
Fur is murder!

10:46.497 --> 10:48.012
Fur is murder!

10:48.132 --> 10:49.676
Fur is murder!

10:49.796 --> 10:51.232
Fur is murder!

10:51.352 --> 10:54.554
How's it feel
to be a murderer?!

10:54.621 --> 10:56.106
Shall we find out?

10:59.872 --> 11:04.265
Lady, you don't scare me...
MALORY Dear, this is a forty-four magnum.

11:05.366 --> 11:08.058
- You're really not scared, are you?
- Newp.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.804
Then how would you like a job?

11:11.872 --> 11:15.908
Three weeks later I was in
Tunisia, killing a different man...

11:15.976 --> 11:17.877
And how and why is that funny?

11:17.945 --> 11:19.579
Not that, I
forgot about that afro.

11:19.646 --> 11:20.380
Hey, ya know what?

11:20.447 --> 11:22.248
I know you looked like
Angela Davis had a lovechild

11:22.316 --> 11:23.983
with Sweet Lou Dunbar.

11:24.051 --> 11:26.219
Shut up... You shut up,
I'm trying to catch us some dinner.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.488
- Well, if you'd brought enough food...
- I wouldn't have had room

11:28.555 --> 11:31.224
- for beer, and I since I can't catch beer...
- Or a fish.

11:31.291 --> 11:32.191
Yes I can.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.257
Burt Reynolds is my spirit-guide.

11:34.377 --> 11:35.428
Did you say man-crush?

11:35.496 --> 11:37.066
No, I'm pretty
sure it was shut up.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.400
What're your
three biggest fears?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.635
Getting stuck on a
boat with you three times.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.851
Ooh, here we go.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.906
C'mere fishy, fishy.

11:46.974 --> 11:52.328
And while you eat humble pie with a side
of crow, Lana I'll be dining on trout.

11:54.281 --> 11:55.148
Waaaaagh!

11:55.215 --> 11:56.115
What the hell is that?!

11:56.183 --> 11:58.655
What the hell
does it look like?!

11:59.686 --> 12:01.053
Shoot it! Shoot it!

12:01.121 --> 12:02.455
ARCHER Oh, so now it's okay?!

12:02.523 --> 12:04.590
What happened to your
fragile ecosystem?!

12:04.658 --> 12:07.126
Screw the damn
ecosystem, shoot!

12:07.194 --> 12:08.517
You are such a hypocrite!

12:08.637 --> 12:11.090
I bet you probably eat veal!

12:15.302 --> 12:16.969
Did you see that?!

12:17.037 --> 12:19.694
And hear that, what is
that, what's that sound?

12:19.814 --> 12:24.287
Oh you are shitting me...
How did you shoot the boat?!

12:24.407 --> 12:27.146
Because I was bucking around
like a rodeo clown in a barrel!

12:27.214 --> 12:28.815
Well did you hit the gator?!

12:28.882 --> 12:29.588
I dunno!

12:29.708 --> 12:32.785
- I mean, maybe...
- Great, so maybe he's wounded.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.378
No, he's definitely wounded.

12:34.498 --> 12:37.919
Oh right, I forgot he has an
arrow, sticking out of his head!

12:38.039 --> 12:39.779
Yeah I think
that's what enraged him.

12:39.899 --> 12:43.696
And so now all twenty enraged feet
of him is swimming around out there...

12:43.764 --> 12:47.900
- In that inky black water...
- Into which we are currently sinking.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.535
Yeah, it's not ideal.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.705
I mean, even if we had more shells,
You only brought two shells?!

12:52.773 --> 12:54.841
No, I brought
shitloads, thank you!

12:54.908 --> 12:55.942
Well where are they?!

12:56.009 --> 13:02.135
In the gear bags...
With your guns. And everything else.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.696
Still got the cooler though, so...

13:08.989 --> 13:11.401
Thank God for small miracles, huh?

13:12.269 --> 13:14.927
Lana. Lana.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.330
Lanaaaa!

13:17.397 --> 13:18.097
What?!

13:18.165 --> 13:20.700
I said thank God
for small miracles.

13:20.767 --> 13:21.701
I heard you.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.092
I know.

13:31.133 --> 13:32.734
Yeah, why dontcha
have another one?

13:32.801 --> 13:33.835
Well, somebody's got to.

13:33.903 --> 13:37.033
- And since you refuse to help...
- You don't need help to get drunk!

13:37.153 --> 13:40.055
Oh please, it takes more
than some three-two... Or, wow,

13:40.175 --> 13:42.874
six percent beer to get
Sterling Archer drunk.

13:42.994 --> 13:44.395
Six, really?

13:44.515 --> 13:46.118
Yeah, so lay off!

13:46.238 --> 13:50.718
There's a giant wounded alligator out
there, not to mention a dangerous

13:50.786 --> 13:53.937
- eco-terrorist...
- Holy shit, totally forgot about him.

13:54.057 --> 13:56.506
I didn't... But that's
even more reason for you to get on board

13:56.626 --> 13:57.425
with my new plan!

13:57.493 --> 13:59.427
Is it as idiotic
as your other plan?

13:59.495 --> 14:01.387
That's how
brainstorming works, Lana!

14:01.507 --> 14:05.029
- It's free-form, you come up with a lot
of ideas... - Yeah, like using the

14:05.149 --> 14:07.402
pipeline to set the
entire swamp on fire.

14:07.469 --> 14:11.439
Which, yes, bad idea, but it got
me thinking about chemical reactions!

14:11.507 --> 14:13.608
Like alcohol's
effect on the brain?

14:13.676 --> 14:17.612
No, like the reaction
between solid carbon dioxide,

14:17.680 --> 14:21.182
also known as dry ice, of
which we have plenty...

14:21.250 --> 14:26.134
And a fun, sexy little molecule
I like to call di-hydrogen monoxide.

14:27.323 --> 14:28.262
- Water?
- Water.

14:28.382 --> 14:30.755
Combine them in a sealed container

14:30.779 --> 14:33.213
- and you've got yourself...
- Some kind of dry ice bomb?

14:33.273 --> 14:36.070
Arrgh, yes, ruiner of explanations.

14:36.190 --> 14:37.855
I was building to that, but yes.

14:37.909 --> 14:39.626
Well, we got plenty of water.

14:39.746 --> 14:41.094
No, the swamp's too dirty,

14:41.214 --> 14:43.590
it's full of whatever alligators shit out

14:43.710 --> 14:45.706
- which I can only assume it's people.
- They don't eat people.

14:45.763 --> 14:48.198
- They eat people all the time.
- They don't.

14:48.241 --> 14:51.128
Last year, Sarasoni County Florida,
Chett Willer, age 16,

14:51.177 --> 14:52.547
swimming in the Oak River Canal,

14:52.667 --> 14:54.039
killed by an 11 footer.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.186
Two years ago, *** County, Georgia,

14:56.306 --> 14:57.987
Ruth Baker, age 39,

14:58.107 --> 15:00.006
killed in her back yard by a 10 footer.

15:00.126 --> 15:04.773
Same year, Pinellas County Florida,
Walter Jakes, age 70, and his dog,

15:04.893 --> 15:06.160
killed by a 12-footer.

15:06.228 --> 15:08.378
- Three years ago, Dade County...
- Archer!

15:08.498 --> 15:09.388
What?!

15:10.369 --> 15:13.255
What are your
three biggest fears? Archer?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.380
Alligators, by far the biggest.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.273
And so... you've memorized
every fatal alligator attack?

15:19.341 --> 15:22.253
Just in the U.S., I can't find
any information on tacks in China.

15:22.845 --> 15:24.304
They only live here and China.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.513
Two different species.

15:25.581 --> 15:28.048
Chinese alligators are smaller,
but their bellies are

15:28.168 --> 15:31.519
fully-armored so it kind of equals
out and... Can we change the subject?!

15:31.587 --> 15:33.621
Okay, what's your
second biggest fear?

15:33.689 --> 15:36.343
God, will ya
just... it's crocodiles!

15:36.463 --> 15:38.008
Wait, do crocodiles
even live here?

15:38.128 --> 15:39.669
Not here-here,
but in the Everglades.

15:39.789 --> 15:41.889
That's like, a
thousand miles away.

15:41.909 --> 15:44.318
Well, three years ago they
caught a 9-foot croc in the surf at

15:44.438 --> 15:46.769
Myrtle Beach so, ya know...
shit happens.

15:46.889 --> 15:47.578
Wow.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.149
Not sure I even wanna know what
your third-biggest fear is...

15:49.269 --> 15:50.571
- Brain aneurysm.
- What?

15:50.639 --> 15:54.292
What does a brain aneurysm have
to do with walking around in a swamp?!

15:54.344 --> 15:56.513
Nothing, it can happen anywhere.
At any time.

15:56.633 --> 15:57.846
That's why it's terrifying.

15:57.914 --> 16:02.384
Oh my God... okay, okay, so if
the gator-poop water is too dirty...

16:02.452 --> 16:03.438
Yeah, we need distilled water.

16:03.558 --> 16:05.287
Does your plan
include finding some?

16:05.355 --> 16:06.098
Yes. But.

16:06.218 --> 16:06.889
But what.

16:06.956 --> 16:08.068
You're not gonna like it.

16:08.188 --> 16:09.437
Do we have to distill our pee?

16:09.557 --> 16:10.905
I guess you can if you want.

16:11.025 --> 16:14.759
- But I was just gonna use this...
- There was bottled water

16:14.790 --> 16:16.298
in there the whole time?!

16:16.366 --> 16:18.367
Yeah, I just forgot.

16:18.434 --> 16:19.601
You forgot.

16:19.669 --> 16:20.636
Thanks, idiot!

16:20.685 --> 16:23.906
What, you still would've burned
your hands reaching in here! Idiot!

16:23.973 --> 16:26.308
I hope an alligator
attacks you at the exact second

16:26.376 --> 16:27.643
you have a brain aneurysm.

16:27.710 --> 16:28.992
How could you even say that?!

16:29.112 --> 16:31.313
That's like me saying I
hope you get cancer!

16:31.381 --> 16:32.539
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

16:32.659 --> 16:33.649
I obviously don't!

16:33.716 --> 16:38.171
But holy shit, Lana... I pour my heart out,
and you just throw it right back in my face?

16:39.389 --> 16:40.700
- Sorry.
- Well, you should be.

16:40.820 --> 16:43.358
That's... wait, okay,
what's your biggest fear?

16:43.426 --> 16:45.052
- Newp.
- Come on, I told you mine!

16:45.172 --> 16:46.595
I know. You lose.

16:46.663 --> 16:48.714
- I think your biggest fear is intimacy...
- Ha.

16:48.834 --> 16:51.333
When what you should be
afraid of is falling in love

16:51.401 --> 16:53.810
with me again because
of my awesomeness.

16:53.930 --> 16:54.736
Check this out.

16:54.804 --> 16:55.971
Wait, how do you light it?

16:56.039 --> 16:58.173
You don't, the pressure
just builds up until it explodes.

16:58.241 --> 16:59.107
How long does that take?

16:59.175 --> 17:01.643
Depends on how much water you
add, we're gonna need to dial it in.

17:01.711 --> 17:03.679
So you have no idea
when that's gonna go off.

17:03.799 --> 17:04.638
How could I?

17:07.596 --> 17:08.786
Aw, shit!

17:15.492 --> 17:16.623
- Asshole.
- Did it getcha?

17:16.742 --> 17:17.792
- No!
- Me neither.

17:17.826 --> 17:19.579
- Wow, again, small...
- Don't!

17:21.244 --> 17:22.385
- Miracles.
- Rrgh!

17:22.414 --> 17:23.284
How long was that?

17:23.326 --> 17:26.200
Oh I'm sorry, I
forgot to time it!

17:26.319 --> 17:27.723
It's okay, I
forgot to measure it.

17:28.570 --> 17:30.376
So we're both gonna
need to do better.

17:30.722 --> 17:32.374
Every single one!

17:32.442 --> 17:34.810
To hell with the tax credits, I
want every last one of those

17:34.878 --> 17:36.578
low-flow toilets out!

17:36.646 --> 17:39.348
Dump them on the street with
those ridiculous light bulbs.

17:39.415 --> 17:41.450
Why do I have to
carry the toilets?

17:41.517 --> 17:42.351
You know why.

17:42.418 --> 17:44.579
Because of the things
that come out of your body.

17:44.621 --> 17:45.414
Oh shut up.

17:45.449 --> 17:48.188
Mister Bigmouth, telling her
we have a women's bathroom.

17:48.308 --> 17:50.595
Where I better never
catch you again!

17:50.610 --> 17:51.226
Okay!

17:51.294 --> 17:53.200
Jeez, hostile work environment.

17:53.257 --> 17:55.404
Yeah, so
everything's back to normal.

17:55.446 --> 17:56.075
Is it?!

17:56.195 --> 17:58.105
I told you lives were at risk!

17:58.225 --> 18:00.369
Now behold the horror
you have wrought!

18:00.436 --> 18:02.371
And Pam? If you're dumping
stuff on the street?

18:02.438 --> 18:03.176
This can all go.

18:03.195 --> 18:04.632
- What is it?
- Shattered dreams.

18:05.308 --> 18:06.366
Smells like rotten meat.

18:06.414 --> 18:07.191
Also, yes.

18:09.312 --> 18:11.079
Yeah, there we go!

18:11.147 --> 18:13.115
Okay, I think we've got
the recipe figured out!

18:13.182 --> 18:14.209
Yeah, that was
actually pretty great.

18:14.329 --> 18:15.758
- Duh! - Shut up!
- You shut up!

18:15.878 --> 18:18.040
Okay, I'll get dry ice
in the rest of the bottles,

18:18.160 --> 18:21.023
you be ready with the water, and
we'll wait for that big fat

18:21.090 --> 18:22.841
stupid gator to come back.

18:22.961 --> 18:24.448
Destroying his
habitat isn't enough?

18:24.568 --> 18:25.408
What?

18:25.528 --> 18:27.856
I would've been here sooner,
but you stole my boat.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.666
Do you not understand how
reservations work, or...?

18:30.733 --> 18:32.668
Reserve this, Treebeard!

18:32.735 --> 18:34.169
Oh please, it's
not even loaded.

18:34.237 --> 18:35.830
- Wh-? Thanks Lana.
- Shut up.

18:35.950 --> 18:37.714
- Hi, Josh.
- Hello, Lana.

18:37.834 --> 18:38.924
You know each other?!

18:39.044 --> 18:42.358
Josh was my Environmental Policy T.A.
When I was in college.

18:42.478 --> 18:43.691
And her lover...

18:51.786 --> 18:52.590
Also, yes.

18:52.615 --> 18:54.389
Wait, I thought he
was a Green Beret!

18:54.457 --> 18:56.658
I went to grad school
on the G.I. bill.

18:56.726 --> 18:59.061
And that's when I realized I
had to lead the fight against

18:59.128 --> 19:01.363
the systematic rape
of Mother Nature.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.665
But back then you just
organized peaceful protests...

19:03.733 --> 19:07.369
Like that day at the fur store
where you disappeared without a trace.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.237
I guess I kinda...
found my calling.

19:09.305 --> 19:12.474
What, as a hired gun for
the military- industrial complex?

19:12.542 --> 19:15.177
A traitor to the cause of
environmental protection?

19:15.244 --> 19:16.411
Me? ! What about you?!

19:16.479 --> 19:19.881
- Always running around, blowing shit up...
- Threatening our supply

19:19.949 --> 19:22.073
- of lamp oil...
- Shut up, but Josh seriously,

19:22.304 --> 19:24.824
do you really think the ends justify
such violent means?

19:24.944 --> 19:25.715
Yes!

19:25.835 --> 19:27.638
Because this is a war!

19:27.758 --> 19:31.210
And victory will only come when Americans
will stop destroying the Earth

19:31.330 --> 19:32.442
just so they can drive

19:32.562 --> 19:36.105
bigger cars, build bigger
houses, and eat bigger food!

19:36.225 --> 19:39.018
- So like, never.
- Yeah.

19:39.263 --> 19:41.344
- Oh my God, that's depressing...
- Sorry.

19:41.598 --> 19:44.139
And I'm also sorry we can't let
you blow up this pipeline.

19:44.259 --> 19:45.440
I wasn't going to.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.325
Well then why... I mean I
was, but I saw you with this idiot,

19:48.445 --> 19:50.612
yelling on the plane
about working for ISIS.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.016
So technically
I saved the pipeline!

19:53.136 --> 19:53.964
Yeah, you're the best.

19:54.084 --> 19:55.293
ARCHER Whatever, I win.

19:55.413 --> 19:56.600
Suck it, Samwise.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.560
- Archer...
- So, you need a lift back to land?

19:59.680 --> 20:02.457
- Yeah, lemme just grab my cooler and...
- Not you! Ass.

20:02.525 --> 20:06.909
Lana? Maybe we can grab dinner,
see some Dixieland jazz?

20:06.942 --> 20:08.747
That sounds lovely.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.713
Oh c'mon, are you kidding me?!

20:11.175 --> 20:12.585
You're really gonna
leave me out here?!

20:12.705 --> 20:13.646
Yup!

20:13.900 --> 20:15.865
I like your new
hairdo, by the way.

20:15.985 --> 20:19.013
Well if you like the collar,
you're gonna love the cuffs...

20:19.938 --> 20:21.476
Well that's just great.

20:21.544 --> 20:26.446
She gets dinner and Dixieland and
laid, and I get mosquitos and no beer

20:26.665 --> 20:27.783
and not laid.

20:27.850 --> 20:29.232
How could this get any w...

20:29.856 --> 20:32.700
Lemme finish, worse?

20:32.820 --> 20:34.816
Now, okay see, you ruined it.

20:36.278 --> 20:37.468
You ruined the moment.
