09:41.104 --> 09:46.303
<i>Here at the top of this tower, there's
a huge, gaping hole, flames still inside.</i>

09:46.409 --> 09:47.671
Can you believe this?

09:47.777 --> 09:50.871
What schmuck would fly a plane
into the Trade Center?

09:51.881 --> 09:54.179
Maybe they ran out of gas or something.

09:55.251 --> 09:57.185
Yeah, Colovito. Right.

09:57.287 --> 10:00.381
Maybe some jerk-off forgot
which lever to pull on his twin-engine.

10:00.490 --> 10:02.424
That's not a small plane.

10:03.993 --> 10:05.153
Hell, no.

10:05.762 --> 10:07.389
All right, listen up!

Let me have your attention here!

10:10.567 --> 10:13.035
They're telling us it's a commuter plane.

10:13.837 --> 10:16.670
Tower One is being evacuated
as a precaution.

11:00.517 --> 11:02.576
<i>Chief on the air. Go ahead.</i>

11:03.353 --> 11:06.789
Come on, everybody. Off the bus.
Get off the bus. Step this way.

<i>Who is advising this?</i>

11:30.480 --> 11:33.506
<i>Central units, the mobilization point
is now South and Pike.</i>

11:34.751 --> 11:36.548
Yeah. No, no, l got it.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.914
Hey, guys, you won't believe this!

11:40.023 --> 11:42.514
My wife says the other one got hit,
the other tower.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.388
How the hell did the other tower get hit?

11:44.494 --> 11:46.655
<i>She was listening to HOT 97
and they said it.</i>

11:46.763 --> 11:50.062
<i>What? Who gets their news
from HOT 97?</i>

11:51.100 --> 11:54.194
-l told you it was no damn private plane.
-No, l got it.

11:55.171 --> 11:57.639
What special equipment
we got down there?

11:59.442 --> 12:02.070
-What?
-We're prepared for everything.

12:02.178 --> 12:06.945
Car bombs, chemical, biological,
an attack from the top.

12:09.018 --> 12:12.078
But not this. Not for something this sie.

12:12.822 --> 12:14.813
There's no plan. We didn't make it.

12:14.924 --> 12:17.620
<i>Only emergency transmissions
on this frequency.</i>

<i>All emergency service units,

12:26.669 --> 12:29.365
There could be 50,
60,000 people in there.

<i>Units on West Street to use caution.</i>

12:45.622 --> 12:48.056
<i>Debris is falling from the building
on West Street.</i>

12:48.258 --> 12:50.988
Hey! Looks like
Tower Two did take a hit.

12:51.461 --> 12:52.928
What did l tell you?

12:53.363 --> 12:56.355
No, no, that's the smoke blowing over
from Tower One.

12:56.466 --> 12:59.492
All right, that's enough.
Everybody sit down. Now!

-This is gonna be a bitch.
-Relax.

13:25.695 --> 13:27.663
Well, l'm just saying
that it looks like it's gonna...

13:27.764 --> 13:29.891
You think they're bringing you
down there to scratch your ass?

13:29.999 --> 13:31.591
McLoughlin will tell you what to do.

13:31.701 --> 13:32.725
Why the Sarge?

13:32.835 --> 13:34.700
He was Emergency Services
at the Trade Tower.

13:34.804 --> 13:37.500
<i>He's one of the guys who came up
with a plan after the attack in '93.</i>

13:37.607 --> 13:39.768

13:39.876 --> 13:41.537
<i>Command to Division One.</i>

13:41.844 --> 13:44.369
<i>Does anyone over
in Tower One hear me?</i>

13:46.082 --> 13:47.310
<i>Okay, make the turn on Broadway.</i>

13:47.417 --> 13:49.977
<i>Go down West Broadway.
We'll meet you outside Five.</i>

13:50.086 --> 13:51.417
You got it.

14:30.226 --> 14:33.525
<i>Send everything you got
to the World Trade Center now.</i>

14:33.930 --> 14:35.761
We got to get that building evacuated!

14:35.865 --> 14:38.197
<i>Which tower?
Which tower are we responding to?</i>

14:38.301 --> 14:41.759
-l got to get a team to go up!
-l'll check in with headquarters.

14:41.871 --> 14:44.965
<i>Roll every available ambulance you got
to this position.</i>

14:49.045 --> 14:50.672
<i>Fire out on the north side.</i>

<i>They're now coming out
of the west side</i>

14:52.749 --> 14:53.716

All right, everybody stay here. l'm gonna
find out what the hell's going on.

15:32.922 --> 15:33.889
Yes, sir.

15:48.371 --> 15:49.770
Oh, my God.

16:01.451 --> 16:02.975
Nothing's gonna help them.

16:03.086 --> 16:04.576
No, we'll get up there.

16:04.687 --> 16:06.985
How are you gonna save people
that high up? lt's impossible.

16:07.090 --> 16:08.614
We got to try.

16:08.724 --> 16:09.850
Sarge!

16:14.530 --> 16:16.259
Officer? Officer?

16:16.766 --> 16:19.997

There's kids there. Over there.

16:20.103 --> 16:21.832
Hey, Sarge! There's kids in the...

16:21.938 --> 16:25.305
Yeah, at the daycare at Five.

16:25.875 --> 16:29.470
-Okay, listen up. Where's Kassimatis?
-He's looking for you, Sarge.

16:29.579 --> 16:31.444
We got to evacuate the Tower.

16:31.848 --> 16:35.579
Who knows how to use a Scott Pak?
And don't give me any PBA bullshit.

16:35.685 --> 16:38.620
Hey, Sarge, to tell you the truth,
l haven't used one in like four years.

16:38.721 --> 16:40.416
Look, what did l just say?

16:41.124 --> 16:42.421
Who's coming?

16:43.559 --> 16:45.026
Step forward.

16:48.898 --> 16:50.525

16:57.940 --> 16:59.407
l'm with you, Sarge.

17:04.113 --> 17:05.272
All right.

17:06.281 --> 17:07.374
All right, we got a team.

17:07.483 --> 17:10.714
We're headed into Building Five.
The rest of you wait for Kassimatis.

17:10.819 --> 17:12.617
Follow me. Stay together.

17:24.099 --> 17:25.499
-Jimeno.
-Sarge.

17:25.601 --> 17:29.230
Take everyone's memo books,
nightsticks, hats. They're useless here.

17:29.672 --> 17:32.436
Put them in the Suburban.
lt's over on Church and Vesey.

17:32.542 --> 17:35.272
And meet us back at the police desk
in the lobby of Five. You got it?

17:35.378 --> 17:36.970
Which one's Five?

17:37.346 --> 17:38.779
There's two towers.

17:39.549 --> 17:42.416
North tower is One. South tower is Two.

17:42.518 --> 17:45.282
Right behind it, there's Five,
right in front of us,

17:45.388 --> 17:46.685
which is where the police desk is.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.757
Take the alley. Hurry up. Hey!

17:50.059 --> 17:51.356
Let's go.

They're all dying!

18:17.520 --> 18:19.317
Grab those bottles.

18:20.456 --> 18:21.616
Get the helmets.

18:21.724 --> 18:24.625
<i>People trapped at 87th and 89th floors.</i>

Okay, turn them on.
Double check. Test them.

Massi? Anything more here?
Helmets? Scott Paks?

18:38.074 --> 18:41.271
No, Sarge. Try the E room
near the truck docks in the basement.

18:41.377 --> 18:42.708
Jimmy Lynch is down there.

18:45.348 --> 18:46.542
Thanks.

18:46.916 --> 18:50.044
Okay, there's more stuff down on B-1 ,
the truck docks.

18:50.186 --> 18:52.654
We'll drop down to the Concourse,
go around One to Two,

18:52.755 --> 18:54.655
and there's some stairs there.

18:55.024 --> 18:58.255
Keep your eyes open. Follow me.
Don't get separated, okay?

18:58.361 --> 18:59.419
Well, Sarge, we got plenty here.

18:59.528 --> 19:01.155
Hundred and ten floors. Fire with fuel.

19:01.264 --> 19:03.858
We're gonna be using up bottles.
We need them.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.067
Sarge, you won't believe this.

19:08.070 --> 19:11.870
Your Suburban on Church? lt's gone.
Roof smashed in.

19:15.811 --> 19:18.075
Stay together and stay focused.

19:18.247 --> 19:20.807
-Yo, Dom, where we going?
-Sarge wants more stuff.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.076
-What?
-Don't worry about it.

19:22.184 --> 19:23.879
He knows what he's doing.

19:24.654 --> 19:25.678
What the...

19:25.788 --> 19:27.187
Don't think. Keep moving.

19:27.290 --> 19:28.882
Jesus, Sarge, we got to get up there.

19:28.991 --> 19:31.789
You aren't rescuing anybody
if you can't breathe, Rodrigues.

19:31.894 --> 19:33.327
Stay focused.

19:41.737 --> 19:43.204
This way.

20:13.169 --> 20:14.136
Where's the fire?

20:33.155 --> 20:35.783
Now you're talking.
Got the BT dogs up in here.

20:35.891 --> 20:38.724
What's up, Sarge?
Sarge, l'm telling you we got to get up.

20:38.828 --> 20:40.318
There's a ton of people stuck up there.

20:40.429 --> 20:42.920
-We're going up.
-Yeah? l gotta go with you.

20:43.032 --> 20:44.966
-Sure, Chris. We can use you.
-Yeah?

20:45.067 --> 20:47.399
We need more equipment.
Get a tank on.

20:47.503 --> 20:48.663
A-Rod!

20:49.071 --> 20:50.299
Yo, what's up, Chris?

20:50.406 --> 20:53.500
Yo, what happened to your eye, man?
What happened to your eye?

20:53.609 --> 20:54.598
l was carrying this woman out,

20:54.710 --> 20:56.200
something whacked me
in the freaking head.

20:56.312 --> 20:58.405
-She okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, l got her clear.

20:58.514 --> 21:01.950
Hey, hey, Sarge, we ain't gonna find
any equipment left in One.

21:02.418 --> 21:05.251
-Coming through. Coming through.
-Excuse us. Thanks a lot.

21:05.388 --> 21:08.789
Lynch has got gear down
at the B-1 truck docks next to Two.

21:08.891 --> 21:11.052
There's a staircase right over there
at Ben & Jerry's.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.128
l heard they were
evacuating Two, Sarge.

21:13.229 --> 21:15.220
Must have caught fire from One.

21:15.331 --> 21:17.322
l heard Two got hit,
that there was a second plane.

21:17.433 --> 21:20.834
No, Fields just said one plane,
Tower One. Now, stay together.

21:23.005 --> 21:25.838
You see the TV?
There's a big fire up there.

21:25.941 --> 21:27.465
There ain't no TVs down here.

21:27.576 --> 21:30.943
You guys hear about the Pentagon?
lt got hit. A missile or something.

21:31.046 --> 21:33.014
lsrael? lt's gone. lt's nuked.

21:33.149 --> 21:35.811
Whole freaking world's

21:35.918 --> 21:37.044
-Yo, Chris.
-Yeah.

21:37.153 --> 21:39.553
-Nice timing on that transfer.
-Yeah, no kidding, right?

21:39.655 --> 21:41.020
-Jimeno?
-Yeah.

You stay with the cart.

21:43.793 --> 21:45.693
The rest of you, come with me.

21:48.364 --> 21:49.831
Stay safe.

21:57.006 --> 21:59.236

27:24.433 --> 27:28.893
l don't think l'm hurt, but l can't move.

28:00.068 --> 28:02.195
between Towers One and Two.

28:03.605 --> 28:05.869
We're trapped near

You're okay, Willy. You're okay.

Got any radio?

Here you go.

28:22.257 --> 28:25.784
No, mine's smashed. lt's not working.

28:25.994 --> 28:30.658
All my stuff on the left side is buried.
The mike's gone.

You got to get this...
You got to get this off of me.

29:02.331 --> 29:04.799
How'd you know to run in here, Sarge?

29:06.068 --> 29:09.333
The elevator shaft's
the strongest part of the building.

29:09.705 --> 29:11.172
Oh, Jesus.

29:12.975 --> 29:14.772
How did this happen, Willy?

Looks like there's light! Maybe some air!

29:36.164 --> 29:38.291

Come on, Dom!

30:07.896 --> 30:09.193
Oh, Jesus.

30:14.536 --> 30:17.232
l can't get this off him by myself, Sarge.

30:18.206 --> 30:21.539
Maybe l should go up and get some help
and then come back for you guys.

30:21.643 --> 30:25.238
No! No! You're gonna get him out!

30:26.615 --> 30:28.412

You can do it. l know you can do it.

All right.

31:24.406 --> 31:26.772

31:27.709 --> 31:31.873
l'll get you out. Yeah, l'll get you out.
All right.

32:28.937 --> 32:30.234
Dom?

32:32.474 --> 32:33.771
Dom?

32:38.847 --> 32:40.178
l'm hurt.

32:45.353 --> 32:48.288
Dom, it's me, Willy.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.088
Look at me.

32:52.727 --> 32:54.092
Stay awake.

32:57.232 --> 32:59.029
Can l get a 3-8, Sarge?

33:01.837 --> 33:04.806
Yeah, Dom. You take a break.

33:09.377 --> 33:11.174
l'm dying, Willy.

33:12.314 --> 33:15.408
No. No, you're not. Dom, stop this.

33:17.486 --> 33:21.217
Don't forget
l really tried to save you guys.

33:32.701 --> 33:34.328
l love you, Willy.

33:36.605 --> 33:38.402
l love you, too, Dom.

34:01.229 --> 34:02.594
Dom's gone.

34:07.636 --> 34:09.159
Dom's gone!

34:10.505 --> 34:11.802
l know.

34:22.484 --> 34:23.781
Jimeno,

34:25.085 --> 34:26.755
can you still see the light?

34:26.755 --> 34:27.187
can you still see the light?

34:28.056 --> 34:29.148
Yeah.

34:30.659 --> 34:31.784
Yeah!

34:33.628 --> 34:34.925
How far up?

34:36.297 --> 34:40.928
l don't know. Maybe 20 feet up.
There's still stuff in the way.

34:42.237 --> 34:43.864
What else do you see?

34:44.505 --> 34:47.475
Beams. Plaster. Nothing.

35:25.780 --> 35:28.578
<i>lt is with deep sadness and regret</i>

35:28.683 --> 35:31.652
<i>that l have to advise you
that two hijacked planes</i>

35:31.853 --> 35:34.287
<i>have crashed into the Twin Towers
of the World Trade Center...</i>

35:34.389 --> 35:36.914
<i>...from what remains
of the World Trade Center for 9:00.</i>

35:37.025 --> 35:39.960
<i>One airplane crashed into
World Trade Center Two.</i>

35:40.061 --> 35:42.962
<i>About 1 5 minutes later, an airplane
crashed into the second one.</i>

35:43.064 --> 35:45.794
<i>About an hour later,
both of them collapsed.</i>

36:16.498 --> 36:20.434
<i>Associated Press is reporting
that a plane or helicopter</i>

36:20.535 --> 36:24.528
<i>crashed at the Pentagon,
and the Pentagon is being evacuated.</i>

36:24.639 --> 36:29.599
<i>Whether that fire is in the building itself
or outside, we have not yet confirmed.</i>

36:29.978 --> 36:32.173
<i>This is a live picture of the Pentagon</i>

36:32.280 --> 36:36.683
<i>and an Associated Press reporter says
he could see the tail of a large airliner</i>

36:36.785 --> 36:38.753
<i>as it plowed into the Pentagon.</i>

36:38.853 --> 36:40.718
<i>And that fire there in Washington
continues to burn.</i>

36:40.822 --> 36:41.948
Bastards!

36:47.028 --> 36:49.394
<i>...just a few minutes after that,
it wasn't very long,</i>

36:49.931 --> 36:54.561
<i>you will see, it happened again.
The second tower came tumbling down.</i>

36:55.170 --> 36:58.003
<i>That was the first tower collapse
that we just saw.</i>

36:58.340 --> 37:00.672
<i>This is the collapse
of the second tower.</i>

37:02.744 --> 37:06.236
<i>And so now, as we stand here,
both towers...</i>

37:06.348 --> 37:09.181
<i>The tops of both towers are gone.</i>

37:09.284 --> 37:10.308
Allison, let's sit outside.

<i>Behind somewhere that plume of smoke

There's no one there.

<i>No Port Authorities there.</i>

37:44.652 --> 37:46.711
<i>Can you get someone to drive you?</i>

37:48.823 --> 37:51.348
<i>-Allison?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

37:53.595 --> 37:56.496
<i>Okay, l'll see you at home
in half an hour.</i>

37:57.499 --> 37:59.126
l'll call Mom and Dad.

38:02.737 --> 38:03.704
Okay.

38:05.473 --> 38:07.168
We got to pick up Bianca.

38:07.542 --> 38:11.410
<i>Both towers came down,
trapping thousands</i>

38:11.513 --> 38:13.538
<i>and thousands of people inside.</i>

38:13.648 --> 38:15.445
<i>We do not know the numbers yet,</i>

38:15.550 --> 38:19.953
<i>but we do know thousands of people
work inside those buildings.</i>

38:20.088 --> 38:22.181
<i>That... The buildings are gone.</i>

38:22.290 --> 38:25.225
<i>There are reports
that hundreds and hundreds</i>

38:25.326 --> 38:28.352
<i>of fire and police and rescue crews</i>

38:28.630 --> 38:31.190
<i>are missing or unaccounted for.</i>

38:31.299 --> 38:35.565
<i>Officials seem simply stunned
by the scale of the losses...</i>

38:35.670 --> 38:38.730
They keep showing the same thing
over and over and over.

38:38.840 --> 38:40.068
Jay's there.

38:40.175 --> 38:43.144
They must have called in
every company in the city.

38:43.244 --> 38:45.041
He would have been there early.

38:45.146 --> 38:47.114
Yeah, John, too, probably.

38:47.816 --> 38:49.875
He knows those buildings so well.

38:50.151 --> 38:53.314
<i>They've seen something
no one has ever seen before.</i>

38:53.421 --> 38:54.945
<i>One man who came by said</i>

38:55.056 --> 38:56.887
<i>he had seen this building come down.</i>

38:56.991 --> 38:59.459
<i>lt looked as though it was imploding.</i>

38:59.561 --> 39:04.726
<i>This was complete chaos and utter hell
that has come to Lower Manhattan.</i>

39:06.935 --> 39:08.232
Oh, my God.

39:09.003 --> 39:12.336
Judy. Listen to me. Listen to me. Look.

39:13.608 --> 39:16.702
They evacuated those buildings.
All right?

39:17.078 --> 39:20.275
l'm sure most everybody got out.
They're fine.

39:21.483 --> 39:24.213
<i>ln the '93 attack,
John said everybody got out real quick.</i>

39:24.319 --> 39:26.981
<i>God. ln '93,
the buildings didn't fall down.</i>

39:28.890 --> 39:31.950
All right, well,
l'm going to call everybody and cancel.

39:32.060 --> 39:36.019
A Den Mothers meeting right now
sounds pretty dumb, right?

39:43.071 --> 39:45.039
l keep looking for John.

39:46.007 --> 39:47.736
There's so many policemen
running around.

39:47.842 --> 39:49.537
Maybe l'll see him.

39:59.921 --> 40:01.616
-Judy.
-Yeah?

40:20.909 --> 40:21.876
Judy...

40:22.210 --> 40:24.678
-They're here to tell us they're dead.
-No.

40:26.247 --> 40:28.374
No, they're not. They're not.

40:41.696 --> 40:44.722
-Hey, Judy. Jay...
-No. No.

40:44.832 --> 40:47.357
Look, we know he's alive. All right?

40:48.202 --> 40:51.228
They know where he is.
They're communicating with him.

40:51.739 --> 40:52.967
He's alive?

40:53.074 --> 40:55.872
Yes. Yeah, we're gonna go
down there now and help out.

40:55.977 --> 40:57.604
-Oh, thank God.
-Yes!

40:59.747 --> 41:01.305
There you go.

41:01.416 --> 41:03.179
-Thank God. Oh, my God.
-There you go.

41:03.284 --> 41:04.808
Oh, that's good.

41:05.820 --> 41:08.118
-That's good.
-Thank you, God.

41:12.660 --> 41:14.127
PAPD.

41:14.896 --> 41:16.193
8-13.

41:18.466 --> 41:20.866
Officers Jimeno and McLoughlin.

41:23.771 --> 41:27.229
We're trapped near
the FE Five vestibule.

41:30.578 --> 41:32.375
Will you please work?

41:36.851 --> 41:38.478
l'm so thirsty.

41:39.621 --> 41:41.088
You're not kidding.

41:41.656 --> 41:43.715
My mouth feels like a beach.

41:48.529 --> 41:51.089
-How's your pain?
-Comes in waves.

41:52.300 --> 41:54.598
Every 20, 30 minutes.

41:56.337 --> 41:59.636
Every wave, l feel the pain less.

42:01.042 --> 42:02.976
But l'm more numb.

42:04.379 --> 42:08.110
The number l get
the more l want to sleep.

42:09.250 --> 42:10.877
What's wrong with sleep?

42:11.519 --> 42:14.488
l wish l could
so this pain would go away.

42:16.691 --> 42:18.556
You're bleeding inside, Will.

42:19.093 --> 42:21.891
You sleep, you don't know
if you're coming back.

42:23.331 --> 42:25.697
Awake, at least you got a shot.

42:27.535 --> 42:29.969
Your brain, maybe, keeps you alive.

42:31.406 --> 42:33.374
That's what l think, anyway.

42:35.910 --> 42:38.208
<i>You know that movie, G.l. Jane?</i>

42:40.415 --> 42:42.042
What's-her-name?

42:43.718 --> 42:46.346
-Yeah, Demi Moore.
-Yeah.

42:48.289 --> 42:50.951
You know the part where
the drill sergeant says,

42:51.325 --> 42:55.955
''Pain is good. Pain is your friend.
lf you're feeling pain you're still alive''?

42:57.865 --> 42:59.833
l didn't see the movie.

43:01.302 --> 43:03.270
l keep thinking of that line.

43:05.139 --> 43:06.606
Pain is your friend.

43:07.108 --> 43:08.700
lt means you're alive.

43:10.578 --> 43:12.205
We'll make it, Will.

43:13.181 --> 43:14.978
Just don't go to sleep.

43:22.123 --> 43:24.091
Sarge, l got a fire here!

43:25.793 --> 43:27.385
Sarge!

43:27.929 --> 43:29.829
There's nothing l can do here!

43:33.234 --> 43:34.360
Sarge!

43:43.277 --> 43:45.575
l'm burning! l'm burning!

43:59.160 --> 44:00.127
Please God.

44:00.228 --> 44:03.061
Where'd that wind come from
all of a sudden, Sarge?

44:05.233 --> 44:06.530
l don't know.

44:06.901 --> 44:09.699
The fire just goes out like that, Sarge?

44:11.572 --> 44:12.937
Why's that?

44:14.075 --> 44:15.337
l don't know.

44:16.644 --> 44:18.703
You're not a big talker, are you?

44:19.881 --> 44:21.007
No.

44:21.149 --> 44:23.276
Well, see, you got to talk to me 'cause...

44:30.224 --> 44:33.682
l can't,
'cause my knees are crushed together!

44:33.928 --> 44:35.896
That's why l can't fucking talk!

44:35.997 --> 44:37.794
Oh, God!

44:39.634 --> 44:42.000
Oh, God. Oh, God.

44:47.141 --> 44:48.369
Holy shit!

44:54.382 --> 44:56.407
Dom's gun is cooking off!

44:57.718 --> 44:58.776
Will!

45:05.459 --> 45:09.361
Will! Will, that's it!
All the rounds got to be done, Will.

45:09.897 --> 45:12.388
l can't believe this is happening!

45:12.900 --> 45:14.527
-Not in my whole goddamn life!
-Breathe, Will.

45:14.635 --> 45:15.966
Come on, breathe.

45:17.805 --> 45:19.272
Get your mind right!

45:32.386 --> 45:33.876
<i>Mrs. Jimeno, please hold.</i>

45:34.255 --> 45:37.691
<i>...Pennsylvania. This is where
the United Airlines flight,</i>

45:37.792 --> 45:40.090
<i>l believe it is 1 76...</i>

45:40.194 --> 45:44.221
<i>l'm sorry, l'm correcting...
United Airlines 93...</i>

45:44.332 --> 45:47.199
<i>l'm sorry, Mrs. Jimeno, we can't make
that kind of assessment yet.</i>

45:47.301 --> 45:48.563
-We just...
-ls that Allison Jimeno?

45:48.669 --> 45:51.001
We grew up together.
Let me talk to her.

45:51.739 --> 45:53.604
Al, it's Brian. l just got in.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.608
<i>-Hi, Brian.
-Allison,</i>

45:56.010 --> 45:59.377
listen, they sent Will down on a bus
with a bunch of the guys.

46:00.314 --> 46:03.340
<i>-So he did go down there?
-Yeah.</i>

46:04.185 --> 46:09.054
And did he go in the buildings?

46:10.558 --> 46:11.855
We don't know.

46:13.327 --> 46:16.455
Brian, did he go in the buildings
or did he not go in the buildings?

46:16.564 --> 46:18.293
<i>We're trying to find that out.</i>

46:18.399 --> 46:22.802
lt's very basic.
Did he go in or did he not go in?

46:23.004 --> 46:25.438
<i>Allison, l'll call you
as soon as we know.</i>

46:25.640 --> 46:27.835
Bianca? Sweetie, l'm sorry.

46:27.942 --> 46:32.276
Brian, l... Brian, why don't you
tell me what's going on?

46:32.380 --> 46:33.438
-l'll take Bianca to my place.
-No.

46:33.547 --> 46:34.878
-l'll keep her here. l wanna...
-My parents are there.

46:34.982 --> 46:38.440
They'll take care of her. Okay?
She'll be five houses away.

46:39.053 --> 46:40.520
Want to go play?

46:40.688 --> 46:42.656
<i>...shards of metal coming past...</i>

46:42.757 --> 46:43.815
Brian?

46:43.958 --> 46:47.359
<i>President Bush was in Florida
when the attacks began.</i>

46:47.495 --> 46:51.192
<i>He spoke a short time ago
from an Air Force base in Louisiana.</i>

46:51.299 --> 46:52.789
<i>Here's some of what the President said.</i>

46:52.900 --> 46:57.997
<i>The resolve of our great nation
is being tested.</i>

46:58.506 --> 47:03.375
<i>But make no mistake, we will show
the world that we will pass this test.</i>

47:03.711 --> 47:04.871
<i>God bless.</i>

47:04.979 --> 47:07.470
<i>We're told the President's plane
has flown on,</i>

47:07.581 --> 47:09.048
<i>but for security reasons,</i>

47:09.150 --> 47:13.018
<i>the government will not say where
Mr. Bush is going or for how long.</i>

47:13.120 --> 47:16.612
l don't know if you guys know it yet,
but this country's at war.

47:45.386 --> 47:47.684
Pastor, l gotta go down there.

47:48.089 --> 47:49.886
-Where?
-New York.

47:53.027 --> 47:57.896
You can't. Only emergency responders
are being allowed in.

48:02.903 --> 48:05.371
l've spent my best years
with the Marines.

48:07.375 --> 48:10.538
God gave me a gift
to be able to help people,

48:10.644 --> 48:12.339
to defend our country.

48:14.382 --> 48:17.681
And l feel him calling on me now
for this mission.

48:19.487 --> 48:21.887
Then find a way to listen, Dave.

48:31.437 --> 48:34.099
<i>l'll leave that to you
to determine just how widespread</i>

48:34.573 --> 48:38.475
<i>the human loss will be
in New York City alone.</i>

48:39.178 --> 48:44.343
<i>America has changed today.
This is a dark day in this country.</i>

48:44.450 --> 48:47.977
<i>lt's in bold print in future history books</i>

48:48.087 --> 48:51.682
<i>about how America was attacked
within its continental borders</i>

48:51.790 --> 48:54.224
<i>to devastating effect by terrorists</i>

48:54.326 --> 48:58.695
<i>in a coordinated assault
using hijacked civilian airliners.</i>

48:59.231 --> 49:01.859
-Hey, Mom?
-Yes, sweetie.

49:01.967 --> 49:04.697
Dad knows it's
my birthday party Saturday, right?

49:05.504 --> 49:07.870
Your birthday, are you cray?
Of course he does.

49:07.973 --> 49:09.065
He's just...

49:09.174 --> 49:12.666
He's still working to help people
at the disaster at the Trade Center.

49:12.778 --> 49:16.145
But they keep saying a lot
of those people aren't coming back.

49:19.285 --> 49:21.651
l'm not supposed to tell you this, okay?

49:22.154 --> 49:25.021
But he told me that he was gonna
take you to the playoffs next month.

49:25.124 --> 49:28.025
-The playoffs? Are you serious?
-l'm serious.

49:28.127 --> 49:30.721
Yes! The Yankee playoffs? l knew it.
l knew he was going to.

49:30.829 --> 49:32.797
Mom, you better come here.

49:45.444 --> 49:47.071
Stay here, okay?

49:48.314 --> 49:49.576
What's wrong?

49:50.416 --> 49:51.747
Dad and Uncle Pat have a deal.

49:51.850 --> 49:55.616
lf anything happens to one of them,
they go and tell the other family.

50:01.961 --> 50:04.054
Are you here to tell me something?

50:04.964 --> 50:07.956
Don't come in here, Pat. l mean it.
Don't you come into this house.

50:08.067 --> 50:09.466
Donna, he's not.

50:09.702 --> 50:11.363
We don't know. We don't know.

50:11.470 --> 50:13.904
They've declared him as missing,
that's all. He's just missing.

50:14.006 --> 50:16.440
l know. l know. l'm with you. Come here.

50:17.309 --> 50:18.503
l know.

50:22.214 --> 50:24.910
We got confirmation. John went in.

50:40.466 --> 50:42.093
Oh, Dad.

50:45.537 --> 50:47.334
lt's okay, baby.

50:48.007 --> 50:50.237
lt's okay. lt's gonna be okay.

50:52.845 --> 50:53.812
Hey. Hey.

50:55.948 --> 50:59.247
Will's a tough nut. He's gonna make it.

50:59.785 --> 51:01.446
-l know it, honey.
-Dad.

51:01.553 --> 51:03.077
-l just know it. Come on.
-Dad.

51:03.188 --> 51:04.678
-Dad.
-Your mom's out there.

51:04.790 --> 51:06.451
-l'll clean you up.
-Dad.

51:07.493 --> 51:08.687
What?

51:10.229 --> 51:11.526
How...

51:14.733 --> 51:18.362
How would l tell Bianca
her father's dead?

51:22.908 --> 51:25.775
Missing means missing, Ma.
lt doesn't mean dead.

51:25.878 --> 51:28.369
She's very strong.
She's gonna be all right.

51:28.781 --> 51:30.180
-Jer.
-Yeah.

51:31.884 --> 51:34.580
We've got to call a doctor.
Give her something fast.

51:35.020 --> 51:37.648
-Why?
-She could lose it.

51:37.856 --> 51:39.756
What is happening to this world?

51:40.025 --> 51:43.654
<i>...of this horrible and vicious
act of terrorism, acts of terrorism.</i>

51:43.762 --> 51:48.756
<i>And our focus now has to be
on saving as many lives as possible.</i>

51:48.867 --> 51:51.358
<i>Do we know the number of casualties
at this point?</i>

51:51.470 --> 51:54.769
<i>l don't think we really want
to speculate about that.</i>

51:55.307 --> 52:01.007
<i>The number of casualties will be more
than any of us can bear, ultimately.</i>

52:03.248 --> 52:05.045
Sounded like a truck bomb.

52:05.918 --> 52:07.647
<i>Like in '93.</i>

52:08.287 --> 52:12.348
Blasted out the lobby.
Pushed everything in here.

52:13.525 --> 52:15.425
Concourse must have collapsed.

52:19.731 --> 52:21.699
You never answered, Sarge.

52:23.135 --> 52:24.602
What have we got?

52:25.737 --> 52:29.833
How long does this
internal bleeding take?

52:30.909 --> 52:33.878
l don't know. l'm not a doctor.

52:34.379 --> 52:38.543
Twenty-four hours
is the most l've heard of. Maybe 1 4,

52:39.651 --> 52:40.948
16.

52:41.453 --> 52:42.818
Just don't sleep.

52:46.792 --> 52:50.523
So we've been in six, seven hours.
What does that mean?

52:51.230 --> 52:53.858
Another seven, eight hours from now?

52:59.738 --> 53:05.005
You remember that earthquake?
Where was it? Turkey?

53:05.744 --> 53:07.644
There was a little girl there.

53:08.313 --> 53:11.305
She lived four days
buried in the rubble like this.

53:12.384 --> 53:14.852
She was, like,
three years old or something.

53:17.055 --> 53:19.285
lf she could make it, we can make it.

53:22.161 --> 53:25.096
Maybe we ain't bleeding so bad inside.

53:33.839 --> 53:37.206
-Sarge?
-Yeah, Will.

53:37.643 --> 53:39.270
You got any kids?

53:40.546 --> 53:42.810
Four. l got four.

53:44.850 --> 53:47.410
-That's a lot of kids.
-Yeah.

53:50.055 --> 53:52.285
lt's a lot of work for my wife.

53:53.892 --> 53:55.519
What are their names?

53:55.661 --> 53:58.061
Steven. He's the oldest.

53:58.797 --> 54:00.264
He's 15.

54:04.069 --> 54:07.163
Caitlin's 12. Peanut.

54:08.607 --> 54:12.338
JJ, he's 10.

54:15.714 --> 54:17.682
We got a little girl.

54:18.951 --> 54:20.248
Erin.

54:21.720 --> 54:23.347
She's four.

54:26.191 --> 54:27.624
We had her late.

54:29.494 --> 54:33.123
lt wasn't planned. lt just... lt happened.

54:36.935 --> 54:38.197
l don't know.

54:50.549 --> 54:53.279
-What's that?
-What's what?

54:54.253 --> 54:55.379
That sound.

54:56.021 --> 54:57.818
l got a pipe here.

55:00.158 --> 55:01.625
Keep doing that!

55:28.220 --> 55:30.188
What about JJ's tuition?

55:32.124 --> 55:35.321
-lt's not easy.
-Right.

55:36.695 --> 55:38.424
Did you vomit yesterday?

55:39.598 --> 55:41.930
Yeah. Yeah, yesterday and today.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.195
-And today?
-Yeah.

55:45.737 --> 55:48.035
You know what?
l probably just have the flu, hon.

55:48.140 --> 55:49.471
Yeah? Okay.

55:52.811 --> 55:53.971
So, wait...

55:54.079 --> 55:56.912
Yeah, there's supposed to be a stripe.

55:57.015 --> 55:59.415
-A stripe? lt's a stripe.
-Yeah.

55:59.518 --> 56:01.145
Yeah, it's a stripe.

56:04.356 --> 56:05.653
That's good.

56:06.792 --> 56:08.282
lt's good. lt's good. lt's good. lt's good.

56:08.393 --> 56:10.156
Yeah, it's good. Yeah.

56:12.564 --> 56:13.656
lt's good.

56:13.765 --> 56:17.132
<i>...seems just like a ghost town
in the financial district. Very eerie.</i>

56:17.235 --> 56:19.703
<i>You saw people being wheeled
on gurneys</i>

56:19.871 --> 56:22.032
<i>away from the site of the explosions.</i>

56:22.140 --> 56:24.404
<i>People were coming out
with masks over their face,</i>

56:24.509 --> 56:25.976
<i>anything they could put over their face</i>

56:26.078 --> 56:28.273
<i>because the air was
still very thick with debris.</i>

56:28.380 --> 56:31.349
<i>The ash on the ground
is at least two inches thick.</i>

56:31.450 --> 56:32.747
<i>lt's more like snow cover.</i>

56:32.851 --> 56:34.182
Mom, listen.

56:36.355 --> 56:37.913
<i>Officials are saying that as many</i>

56:38.023 --> 56:41.925
<i>as 400 police, fire and rescue teams
entered the towers,</i>

56:42.027 --> 56:45.861
<i>and there are fears that half of them
are missing and feared lost.</i>

56:45.964 --> 56:48.489
<i>We are waiting for more
on the survivors.</i>

56:48.934 --> 56:51.164
<i>There are no clear estimates
yet on numbers,</i>

56:51.269 --> 56:54.636
<i>but it is clear that many
of New York's finest</i>

56:54.740 --> 56:56.605
<i>have been lost on this day.</i>

56:56.708 --> 56:59.609
<i>These are the so-called
first responders.</i>

56:59.711 --> 57:01.076
Oh, my God.

57:02.714 --> 57:05.410
That's so many.
What are we going to do?

57:06.385 --> 57:07.909
Mom, let's go get him.

57:09.421 --> 57:11.753
Can we just go to the city and find Dad?

57:11.857 --> 57:14.519
-We don't even know where he is.
-You're gonna go drive and get him?

57:14.626 --> 57:16.890
-Can't you call someone?
-The phones don't work.

57:16.995 --> 57:18.656
Come on, JJ,
there's really nothing we could do.

57:18.764 --> 57:21.597
-You're just worried about your birthday.
-No, Caitlin, stop it.

57:21.700 --> 57:23.964
He needs us. l know if we just go
down there, we can find him.

57:24.069 --> 57:25.434
Dad doesn't need you to go find him.

57:25.537 --> 57:26.561
Come on, Mom, please.

57:26.671 --> 57:29.731
JJ, would you just stop it?
Stop it for a minute. Okay?

57:29.841 --> 57:31.433
They'll call when they know something.

57:31.543 --> 57:34.444
Lay off your ma, please. This is tough
enough on everybody. Come on.

57:36.348 --> 57:37.975
You don't really care, do you?

57:43.622 --> 57:45.249
l'll go talk to him.

57:45.624 --> 57:48.388
Hey, JJ, come on.
Come back here, kid. Let's go.

57:48.560 --> 57:50.721
He's scared. He's just a kid.

57:50.862 --> 57:51.829
Yeah.

57:53.899 --> 57:55.526
He's right, you know?

57:57.235 --> 58:00.033
l don't even remember
the last thing l said to John.

58:07.345 --> 58:08.642
Excuse me.

58:18.290 --> 58:19.279
This is it.

58:19.391 --> 58:24.021
l'm sorry. No, sir.
Nobody gets by here. Nobody gets by.

58:24.129 --> 58:25.289
United States Marines.

58:25.397 --> 58:28.560
-Sure thing. ls your unit down there?
-Yes, sir.

58:59.197 --> 59:01.324
l'm gonna take a 3-8, Sarge.

59:03.335 --> 59:04.461
Okay.

59:07.706 --> 59:09.606
Just don't go to sleep.

59:14.045 --> 59:15.706
''Let me get that.''

59:17.082 --> 59:18.208
What?

59:19.584 --> 59:21.609
That's what he said to me.

59:22.354 --> 59:23.651
Antonio.

59:24.756 --> 59:26.485
''Will, let me get that.''

59:28.260 --> 59:29.318
The cart.

59:31.930 --> 59:34.228
lf he hadn't switched places with me...

59:36.601 --> 59:38.068
And Dom.

59:40.505 --> 59:41.972
l made him stay and help me.

59:43.408 --> 59:45.103
l told him to stay.

59:46.344 --> 59:48.141
Yeah, l begged him.

59:49.981 --> 59:53.041
''Don't leave me, Dom.
Please don't leave me.'' And he stayed.

59:53.652 --> 59:55.950
You know, there was time.
He could have gotten out.

59:56.788 --> 01:00:00.849
And Chris. After being cut so bad,
he didn't have to go in.

01:00:04.262 --> 01:00:05.729
You tell them.

01:00:10.335 --> 01:00:11.825
You tell them.

01:00:16.441 --> 01:00:17.965
l took them in.

01:00:20.178 --> 01:00:21.440
For what?

01:00:24.382 --> 01:00:26.145
What good did we do?

01:00:26.851 --> 01:00:28.580
We wanted to go in.

01:00:28.887 --> 01:00:30.479
Kassimatis said you were the best.

01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:32.887
You were the guy
who knew everything down here.

01:00:33.525 --> 01:00:38.053
Dom, Antonio and Chris, nothing was
gonna stop them from trying to help.

01:00:38.597 --> 01:00:41.725
We figured
we might as well follow the best guy in.

01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:44.227
The best?

01:00:44.402 --> 01:00:46.802
They did what they had to do, Sarge.

01:00:47.205 --> 01:00:50.470
They couldn't have lived
with themselves if they hadn't gone in.

01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:52.242
That's who they were.

01:00:54.245 --> 01:00:55.371
Okay.

01:00:57.582 --> 01:00:59.140
Thank you, Will.

01:01:11.262 --> 01:01:12.388
Will?

01:01:13.098 --> 01:01:18.058
lf this is it,
l am gonna see you someplace better.

01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:21.903
Sarge, l don't know you too good...

01:01:22.007 --> 01:01:23.235
Our Father...

01:01:23.341 --> 01:01:24.501
...but l love you!

01:01:24.609 --> 01:01:26.076
...who art in heaven...

01:01:26.344 --> 01:01:28.039
-Goodbye, John!
-...hallowed be thy name.

01:01:28.346 --> 01:01:31.645
Give us this day our daily bread...

01:01:31.916 --> 01:01:35.044
Thank you, God, Allison and Bianca,

01:01:35.587 --> 01:01:37.384
who needs a daddy.

01:01:37.922 --> 01:01:40.720
Oh, God! Forgive us

01:01:41.593 --> 01:01:44.653
our trespasses as we...

01:01:44.763 --> 01:01:46.390
Let her know l love her!

01:01:46.665 --> 01:01:48.963
...forgive those
who trespass against us!

01:02:42.087 --> 01:02:43.213
John?

01:02:45.256 --> 01:02:46.553
You there?

01:02:52.397 --> 01:02:54.160
Yeah, Will.

01:02:57.035 --> 01:02:58.297
l'm here.

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:01.996
l'm still here.

01:03:06.845 --> 01:03:09.814
<i>About 20 minutes ago,
we were reporting on another building</i>

01:03:09.914 --> 01:03:11.848
<i>at the site of the World Trade Center</i>

01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:14.578
<i>that they referred to as Building Seven.</i>

01:03:14.686 --> 01:03:17.985
<i>Officials were watching
very closely because</i>

01:03:18.089 --> 01:03:21.058
<i>it was on fire
and in danger of collapsing.</i>

01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:23.917
<i>Well, moments ago, it did collapse.</i>

01:03:24.329 --> 01:03:27.298
<i>So that would be the third building
in the World Trade Center complex</i>

01:03:27.398 --> 01:03:29.332
<i>that has collapsed today.</i>

01:03:29.434 --> 01:03:32.062
<i>There are no reports yet
of additional casualties...</i>

01:03:36.908 --> 01:03:38.307
<i>Rescue officials in the area</i>

01:03:38.409 --> 01:03:40.274
<i>have suspended
the search for survivors.</i>

01:03:43.348 --> 01:03:47.284
<i>No word yet on when rescue teams
might get back to trying to find anyone...</i>

01:03:47.385 --> 01:03:49.444
That's a lot of guys not with him.

01:03:52.624 --> 01:03:54.319
Port Authority Police.
Sergeant King speaking.

01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:31.820
l got cars cooking off.
l got rounds flying all over the place.

01:04:32.263 --> 01:04:36.825
l've got guns all over the place.
Now back off. lt's getting dark out.

01:04:36.935 --> 01:04:39.403
Chief, you got to let us in.
My whole battalion's in here, Chief.

01:04:39.504 --> 01:04:41.972
-There's still guys in there.
-l know it, boys. Not tonight.

01:04:42.073 --> 01:04:45.509
Tomorrow's another day.
lt'll be dark in a half an hour, man!

01:04:45.610 --> 01:04:50.377
God bless their souls,
but l'm not letting you join them!

01:05:11.169 --> 01:05:13.535
Everybody report to the station there.

01:05:26.084 --> 01:05:28.052
What's the status here?

01:05:28.653 --> 01:05:30.382
The search has been called off.

01:05:30.488 --> 01:05:34.219
They say the Marriott's gonna go, too,
and until it's more stable, we're out.

01:05:36.661 --> 01:05:38.891
This whole thing is crap, man.

01:05:38.997 --> 01:05:41.693
Our guys are in there.
They're dying in there.

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:47.605
lt's like God made a curtain
with the smoke,

01:05:48.373 --> 01:05:51.570
shielding us
from what we're not yet ready to see.

01:05:55.146 --> 01:05:56.875
All right, nut bag.

01:06:50.068 --> 01:06:52.036
Didn't even finish them.

01:07:09.921 --> 01:07:12.549
<i>...a 45-degree angle.</i>

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:15.124
See? Okay?

01:07:15.226 --> 01:07:19.094
You put the plywood here.
Put the saw here. Nice and easy.

01:07:19.263 --> 01:07:21.754
Don't force anything. All right?

01:07:22.867 --> 01:07:24.494
Want to try again? Okay.

01:07:29.807 --> 01:07:32.002
Don't force it. There you go.

01:07:47.825 --> 01:07:51.317
Sarge? You never told me
your wife's name.

01:07:53.865 --> 01:07:55.196
lt's Donna.

01:07:56.434 --> 01:07:59.130
Donna? That's a good name.

01:08:00.071 --> 01:08:02.266
lt's real American, you know?

01:08:03.574 --> 01:08:05.007
Mine's Allison.

01:08:05.643 --> 01:08:08.203
She's ltalian and some German.

01:08:09.647 --> 01:08:11.274
Don't get her mad.

01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:14.311
Yeah. She's a wild one.

01:08:14.886 --> 01:08:19.345
Donna can get mad, too.
She wants a new kitchen.

01:08:20.658 --> 01:08:24.287
l'm okay carpenter, so

01:08:25.395 --> 01:08:27.193
l'm building her one.

01:08:28.299 --> 01:08:30.563
There's no cabinets right now.

01:08:31.636 --> 01:08:33.103
She's pissed.

01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:36.165
So

01:08:37.809 --> 01:08:39.606
l got to get out of here.

01:08:41.112 --> 01:08:43.238
Donna, she's...

01:08:47.218 --> 01:08:49.652

01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:52.656
Yeah, l know.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:54.819
Me, too.

01:08:55.725 --> 01:08:57.694
Tell me about your wife.

01:08:59.529 --> 01:09:01.020
Well, she's

01:09:02.567 --> 01:09:05.399
five months pregnant now.

01:09:07.238 --> 01:09:08.705
lt's gonna be a girl.

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:13.475
l already got one. Bianca.

01:09:14.045 --> 01:09:15.410
She's four.

01:09:51.249 --> 01:09:53.149
You got to name Bianca.

01:09:54.652 --> 01:09:56.517
You love that name Bianca.

01:09:56.621 --> 01:09:59.317
No. l love the name, but you picked it.

01:10:00.525 --> 01:10:01.651
So?

01:10:02.460 --> 01:10:04.928
So l get to choose the name this time.

01:10:06.197 --> 01:10:07.494
Alyssa.

01:10:08.432 --> 01:10:09.899
Alyssa?

01:10:10.468 --> 01:10:14.427
Kids are gonna love that name.
''Alyssa the pisser.''

01:10:15.173 --> 01:10:17.164
Look, l like Olivia.

01:10:17.808 --> 01:10:21.244
Olivia? Olivia sounds like Olive Oyl.

01:10:21.345 --> 01:10:22.642
-Will.
-What?

01:10:23.414 --> 01:10:24.745
Olivia.

01:10:26.317 --> 01:10:28.012
Olivia Jimeno.

01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:06.014
l'm naming the baby Alyssa.

01:11:07.091 --> 01:11:08.718
lt's what Will wanted.

01:11:13.264 --> 01:11:14.561

01:11:14.966 --> 01:11:18.094
-l'm gonna pick up that prescription.
-What prescription?

01:11:18.603 --> 01:11:21.504
The doc called in
a prescription for you, honey.

01:11:21.606 --> 01:11:23.073
You know, for the baby.

01:11:24.041 --> 01:11:26.475

just in case.

01:11:27.311 --> 01:11:28.471

01:11:41.425 --> 01:11:42.983
-Allison...
-l'm coming, too.

01:11:55.706 --> 01:11:56.730
What am l doing here?

01:11:56.841 --> 01:11:58.832
-Al, you all right?
-Yeah.

01:11:59.143 --> 01:12:00.804
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:12:01.145 --> 01:12:04.945
Will could be never coming home.

01:12:05.983 --> 01:12:09.180
l'm walking around CVS
like there's nothing wrong.

01:12:09.487 --> 01:12:09.720
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.085
You said
you wanted to get out of the house.

01:12:11.188 --> 01:12:13.418
You have your cell phone?

01:12:15.960 --> 01:12:17.291
l left it.

01:12:17.928 --> 01:12:19.259
Karen, you have your cell phone?

01:12:19.363 --> 01:12:20.455
Karen.

01:12:24.568 --> 01:12:25.660
l forgot it.

01:12:26.637 --> 01:12:28.969
We left the house with no phone?

01:12:54.565 --> 01:12:56.089
Al, what are you doing?

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:59.169
Got to get home.
This stupid light is taking forever!

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:00.567
Come on!

01:13:03.708 --> 01:13:05.175
-Allison!
-Al.

01:13:05.409 --> 01:13:09.641
Allison! Would you get back
in the goddamn car?

01:13:10.047 --> 01:13:11.344
We're going home.

01:13:19.256 --> 01:13:20.689
Did he call?

01:13:36.407 --> 01:13:37.499
Sarge?

01:13:38.476 --> 01:13:41.104
l don't think
l'm gonna make it to the morning.

01:13:44.215 --> 01:13:45.807
-l feel like...
-Will.

01:13:46.751 --> 01:13:48.412
-Like...
-Will.

01:13:49.053 --> 01:13:52.614
You die, l'm gonna die.

01:13:53.924 --> 01:13:55.323
Okay?

01:13:55.993 --> 01:13:57.187
You die,

01:13:58.829 --> 01:14:00.694
l'm just gonna die.

01:14:03.067 --> 01:14:05.194
Well, you can't die, either.

01:14:06.537 --> 01:14:07.936
Sounds good.

01:14:09.273 --> 01:14:10.900
But in case...

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:14.372
You think you could do me a favor?

01:14:15.212 --> 01:14:16.679
What's that?

01:14:16.781 --> 01:14:19.375
Could you put it out over the radio

01:14:21.051 --> 01:14:22.541
that l request

01:14:24.088 --> 01:14:27.057
my daughter to be named Olivia?

01:14:29.193 --> 01:14:30.490
And tell them

01:14:31.796 --> 01:14:33.923
to tell Allison that l love her,

01:14:35.132 --> 01:14:37.896
and that she should name
my daughter Olivia.

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:50.842
8-13.

01:14:52.216 --> 01:14:53.979
This is McLoughlin

01:14:55.052 --> 01:14:56.144
PAPD.

01:14:57.121 --> 01:15:01.820
Officer Jimeno requests
his daughter be named

01:15:02.793 --> 01:15:03.987
Olivia.

01:15:05.763 --> 01:15:07.321
Officer Jimeno

01:15:09.266 --> 01:15:12.827
would like his wife, Allison,

01:15:13.671 --> 01:15:16.299
to know he loves her.

01:15:21.312 --> 01:15:23.109
Further to that,

01:15:26.851 --> 01:15:28.648
please tell

01:15:29.753 --> 01:15:31.220
my family

01:15:32.656 --> 01:15:34.954
l love them

01:15:39.396 --> 01:15:40.727
very much.

01:16:56.507 --> 01:16:58.031
Jee Louise.

01:17:07.751 --> 01:17:08.843
JJ!

01:17:08.953 --> 01:17:11.114
<i>...psychologically across the country.</i>

01:17:11.355 --> 01:17:13.084
<i>lt's had such an enormous...</i>

01:17:21.665 --> 01:17:23.690
JJ, what are you doing?

01:17:23.801 --> 01:17:25.428
l told you before.

01:17:30.708 --> 01:17:33.006
-Sweetie, get out of the car.
-No.

01:17:34.578 --> 01:17:36.978
-JJ, get out of this car. Now!
-No.

01:17:37.114 --> 01:17:39.014
-Don't say no to me.
-What's wrong with you?

01:17:39.116 --> 01:17:41.277
-Don't you want to find him?
-Yes, l want to find him.

01:17:41.385 --> 01:17:43.615
-What if he's dying?
-There's nothing that we can do.

01:17:43.721 --> 01:17:45.279
What if we never see him again?

01:17:56.033 --> 01:17:57.500
All right, l'll go. Get out.

01:17:58.235 --> 01:18:00.465
l said l'm going. Now, come on.

01:18:03.907 --> 01:18:05.932
You want some tuna without the bread?

01:18:06.343 --> 01:18:07.970
No, Mom, l'm not hungry.

01:18:13.283 --> 01:18:15.080
You have to eat something.

01:18:15.986 --> 01:18:17.749
The baby's going through this,
too, honey.

01:18:19.857 --> 01:18:20.949
How about a waffle?

01:18:21.058 --> 01:18:23.356
Forget it, Patricia. She'd throw it up.

01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:41.172
l could cook up some macaroni.

01:18:41.879 --> 01:18:46.782
No, that's okay, Ma.
l'm going to put Bianca to bed.

01:18:51.255 --> 01:18:53.655
<i>lt's also a great test for us all,</i>

01:18:53.757 --> 01:18:56.920
<i>wherever we live, whatever our age,
whatever our beliefs.</i>

01:18:58.429 --> 01:19:01.830
<i>Just look at that scene
and think about what happened today.</i>

01:19:03.467 --> 01:19:07.699
<i>Rescue officials predict that hundreds,
if not thousands...</i>

01:19:46.076 --> 01:19:48.101
-Mommy!
-Hey, baby.

01:19:59.156 --> 01:20:01.090
ls Daddy coming home?

01:20:08.665 --> 01:20:09.757
Honey,

01:20:13.403 --> 01:20:14.870
l don't know.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:50.606
United States Marines!
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

01:20:55.879 --> 01:20:59.576
United States Marines.
lf anyone can hear me, yell or tap!

01:21:03.253 --> 01:21:04.880
United States Marine?

01:21:11.495 --> 01:21:13.622
Are you heading in, too, Devil Dog?

01:21:15.132 --> 01:21:17.930
l've reconned the area, Sergeant.

01:21:20.204 --> 01:21:22.866
Our best shot is going up.

01:21:24.608 --> 01:21:25.905
All right.

01:21:31.481 --> 01:21:33.381
Someone says stop, you don't stop.

01:21:33.483 --> 01:21:36.281
You don't hear them.
There's no going back.

01:21:37.688 --> 01:21:38.985
Let's go.

01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:41.387
Thomas.

01:21:45.262 --> 01:21:46.456
Karnes.

01:21:54.605 --> 01:21:58.063
United States Marines.
lf you can hear me, yell or tap.

01:22:40.217 --> 01:22:41.514
Sarge?

01:22:43.287 --> 01:22:44.379
John.

01:22:46.823 --> 01:22:47.949
Yeah.

01:22:50.193 --> 01:22:52.661
The most amaing thing just happened.

01:22:54.131 --> 01:22:55.655
l saw Jesus.

01:22:58.869 --> 01:23:00.336
And you know what?

01:23:02.306 --> 01:23:04.297
He had a bottle of water.

01:23:05.609 --> 01:23:09.306
And l could have drunk it, you know?

01:23:10.347 --> 01:23:12.144
But l didn't drink it.

01:23:14.451 --> 01:23:16.749
He's telling us something, Sarge.

01:23:18.355 --> 01:23:20.482
He's telling us to come home.

01:23:24.394 --> 01:23:26.259
Don't sleep on me, John.

01:23:27.864 --> 01:23:29.161
No.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.430
The pain's keeping me alive.

01:23:34.471 --> 01:23:35.938
Keep talking.

01:23:39.609 --> 01:23:41.839
<i>You remember Starsky and Hutch?</i>

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.105
When l was a kid, it was on TV.

01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:49.748
l remember the theme song.

01:23:56.393 --> 01:23:57.860
When that would come on,

01:23:57.961 --> 01:24:01.328
l'd run around the house
and arrest my sister, Karen.

01:24:05.469 --> 01:24:07.699
Took me six years to be a cop.

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:12.940
The only thing
l ever wanted to be was a cop.

01:24:14.878 --> 01:24:16.505
How long you been in?

01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:20.411
Twenty-one years.

01:24:21.151 --> 01:24:22.778
Boy, that's a lifetime.

01:24:25.555 --> 01:24:27.682
You're one tough guy, Sergeant.

01:24:29.359 --> 01:24:33.159
l don't smile a lot.

01:24:38.402 --> 01:24:40.461
That's why l'm not

01:24:42.072 --> 01:24:43.562
lieutenant.

01:24:44.608 --> 01:24:45.905
People

01:24:47.210 --> 01:24:49.644
don't like me 'cause

01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.706
l don't smile a lot.

01:25:03.827 --> 01:25:05.954
Yeah, that's it. You got it.

01:25:06.763 --> 01:25:09.061
We got Frank Sinatra over here.

01:25:24.514 --> 01:25:27.005
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

01:25:55.879 --> 01:25:57.176
John.

01:25:58.348 --> 01:25:59.975
John.

01:26:01.184 --> 01:26:02.981
Remember what you said?

01:26:04.054 --> 01:26:06.545
You sleep, you ain't coming back.

01:26:07.257 --> 01:26:10.124
You got to come back,
'cause we're getting out of here.

01:26:20.537 --> 01:26:21.834
Sarge!

01:26:25.108 --> 01:26:26.735
John McLoughlin!

01:26:28.211 --> 01:26:30.907
lf you can hear me, yell or tap!

01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:33.208
Can you hear me?

01:26:35.552 --> 01:26:36.849
Are you sleeping?

01:26:40.490 --> 01:26:41.752
Sarge!

01:26:45.328 --> 01:26:46.522
Will?

01:26:50.167 --> 01:26:51.634
Where are we?

01:26:53.303 --> 01:26:54.600
ln hell.

01:26:57.474 --> 01:26:59.237
We're alive in hell.

01:26:59.543 --> 01:27:01.170
How about that, John?

01:27:03.647 --> 01:27:04.944
Pipe.

01:27:06.783 --> 01:27:07.977
Keep trying.

01:27:09.386 --> 01:27:10.717
Try the pipe.

01:27:23.867 --> 01:27:24.891
Good.

01:27:25.936 --> 01:27:27.403
Keep doing it.

01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:39.208
We could circle back.

01:27:44.754 --> 01:27:46.381
Never mind.

01:27:51.461 --> 01:27:52.587
Yeah.

01:28:00.103 --> 01:28:01.400
We hear you!

01:28:02.539 --> 01:28:04.166
We hear you!

01:28:08.278 --> 01:28:09.575
-Go!
-Keep yelling!

01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.677
8-13! PAPD down!

01:28:14.184 --> 01:28:16.516
-Who's down there?
-PAPD.

01:28:16.620 --> 01:28:18.247
McLoughlin and Jimeno.

01:28:19.856 --> 01:28:21.824
-Hello?
-Here!

01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:24.089
l don't see you!

01:28:24.361 --> 01:28:25.828
You got to be kidding me.

01:28:27.030 --> 01:28:28.327
Here!

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:31.394
Gotcha.

01:28:31.501 --> 01:28:32.798
Gotcha!

01:28:37.407 --> 01:28:39.739
Just hang on! Just hang on, okay?

01:28:40.377 --> 01:28:42.777
Don't leave us.
We've been here a long time.

01:28:42.879 --> 01:28:47.043
We're not leaving you, buddy.
We're Marines. You are our mission.

01:28:48.952 --> 01:28:51.750
That's great! Oh, that's great!

01:28:56.626 --> 01:28:58.423
The Marines, John!

01:28:59.629 --> 01:29:01.597
Can you believe that?

01:29:07.137 --> 01:29:09.332
Sergeant, if we leave this spot,
we might never make it back.

01:29:09.439 --> 01:29:10.906
That's what l'm thinking.

01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:14.974
-lt's overloaded?
-Yeah.

01:29:18.381 --> 01:29:20.349
My sister in Pittsburgh.

01:29:23.119 --> 01:29:24.518
<i>Hello?</i>

01:29:24.821 --> 01:29:26.789
lt's me. l'm at the Trade Center.

01:29:27.190 --> 01:29:28.589
Yeah. Emergency Command.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.087
You got an exact location on that?

01:29:36.966 --> 01:29:38.126
Great. Yeah.

01:29:38.234 --> 01:29:41.670
Guys, l got two Port Authority cops
found in the middle of the rubble.

01:29:41.805 --> 01:29:43.329
They're still alive.

01:29:53.283 --> 01:29:54.580
l got it.

01:29:58.788 --> 01:30:00.415
Thank God!

01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:03.184
They found him, Donna!
You hear that? They got him.

01:30:03.293 --> 01:30:05.727
Wait. Wait a minute.
Wait, wait. All right.

01:30:06.296 --> 01:30:08.764
All right. All right. Thank you.
We're on our way.

01:30:10.033 --> 01:30:12.797
He's okay! The son of a bitch
walked right out onto Liberty Street.

01:30:12.902 --> 01:30:15.166
They want us to meet him
at the bus terminal.

01:30:15.271 --> 01:30:17.603
l am going to kick his ass
when l see him!

01:30:19.275 --> 01:30:21.243
He just walked right out.

01:30:22.245 --> 01:30:23.872
He just walked right out.

01:30:33.690 --> 01:30:35.749
-Allison, he's alive.
-What?

01:30:35.859 --> 01:30:38.327
He's alive. They couldn't kill him.
They couldn't kill him.

01:30:38.428 --> 01:30:39.395
They found him.

01:30:39.796 --> 01:30:41.855
He's trapped,
but they're digging him out right now.

01:30:41.965 --> 01:30:45.264
He's the toughest son of a gun l know.
He's made of rocks, is he not?

01:30:46.069 --> 01:30:47.866
-He's coming home.
-Come on. Let's go.

01:30:49.105 --> 01:30:53.064
Have you been working out?
l can't keep up to you here.

01:31:02.118 --> 01:31:04.177
l told you. Didn't l tell you?

01:31:04.287 --> 01:31:06.414
So where are we supposed
to pick him up?

01:31:06.823 --> 01:31:08.791
Where are we supposed to pick him up?

01:31:10.660 --> 01:31:11.957
No one asked?

01:31:12.128 --> 01:31:14.255
Jerry! What're you doing?

01:31:26.876 --> 01:31:28.503
-You're the Marine?
-Yeah.

01:31:28.611 --> 01:31:31.239
Scott Strauss, Emergency Service Unit.

01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:36.580
What do we got? How many
are down there? Two down there?

01:31:36.686 --> 01:31:38.813
They're Port Authority cops.

01:31:39.289 --> 01:31:41.985
The first one's down about 20 feet,
in pretty bad shape.

01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:43.752
The second one's even deeper.

01:31:44.027 --> 01:31:48.327
lt's a tough hole to get down,
but they're in there, and they're alive.

01:31:48.631 --> 01:31:50.428
We got to hold them off, Paddy.

01:31:50.967 --> 01:31:52.264
All right, listen up.

01:31:53.236 --> 01:31:54.863
No one make any sudden moves.
All right?

01:31:54.971 --> 01:31:57.872
This whole thing's
like a pile of pick-up sticks.

01:31:58.341 --> 01:32:00.832
-ls there any F.D. up here?
-Any F.D. up here?

01:32:00.944 --> 01:32:02.309
-Ed! Ed.
-Yeah.

01:32:02.412 --> 01:32:04.972
Go back to Church.
Get the fire department up here.

01:32:05.081 --> 01:32:06.139
Got it.

01:32:06.249 --> 01:32:08.513
ls Captain Yee on the radio?
Captain Yee on the air?

01:32:08.618 --> 01:32:09.744
<i>On the air.</i>

01:32:09.853 --> 01:32:12.515
<i>-Captain. Captain, it's Scott Strauss.
-Go ahead.</i>

01:32:12.622 --> 01:32:14.817
l got two cops here buried in the rubble.

01:32:15.792 --> 01:32:19.250
Right in the pile near the globe.
l need equipment and manpower.

01:32:19.596 --> 01:32:22.224
Also get F.D. up here forthwith.
We're gonna burn.

01:32:22.332 --> 01:32:23.629
<i>Got it, Scotty. Stay safe.</i>

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.268
l need a paramedic!
Who here's a medic?

01:32:26.503 --> 01:32:27.800
l used to be.

01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:32.408
Used to be? Jesus Christ. Come on!
l need a paramedic here.

01:32:32.775 --> 01:32:34.743
My license lapsed.

01:32:35.945 --> 01:32:37.810
l had a few bad years.

01:32:38.915 --> 01:32:41.315
But l know what l'm doing.

01:32:42.352 --> 01:32:43.614
l'm good.

01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:47.087
You know this whole thing
could collapse on our heads and kill us?

01:32:47.991 --> 01:32:49.288
Yeah.

01:32:50.894 --> 01:32:52.191
What's your name?

01:32:52.695 --> 01:32:54.185
Chuck Sereika.

01:32:54.531 --> 01:32:56.761
l'm Scott. Come on. All right.

01:32:58.268 --> 01:32:59.257
Hey.

01:32:59.369 --> 01:33:02.304
-Seen the way to one of them.
-All right, Paddy. Call it.

01:33:02.605 --> 01:33:04.402
lt's real tight, Scotty.

01:33:05.608 --> 01:33:06.575
Hey.

01:33:06.776 --> 01:33:09.244
You're never gonna get down there
with all that gear, buddy.

01:33:09.345 --> 01:33:12.473
Try this, Marine KBAR.
Best knife ever made.

01:33:13.583 --> 01:33:15.881
Thanks. You got a name, Marine?

01:33:16.119 --> 01:33:17.609
Staff Sergeant Karnes.

01:33:18.187 --> 01:33:20.155
l mean, something a little shorter.

01:33:21.491 --> 01:33:23.015
Staff Sergeant.

01:33:25.228 --> 01:33:27.025
-Okay.
-You all right?

01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:28.097
Yeah.

01:33:29.566 --> 01:33:30.897
Okay.

01:33:38.975 --> 01:33:40.875
My wife is Pat Strauss.

01:33:41.611 --> 01:33:44.546
You tell her and my kids
that l love them, okay?

01:33:49.252 --> 01:33:50.719
You ready?

01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.817
-Let's go.
-All right.

01:34:02.098 --> 01:34:04.089
Hi. Where's John McLoughlin?

01:34:04.567 --> 01:34:06.262
-Mrs. McLoughlin?
-Yes.

01:34:07.704 --> 01:34:10.901
He's alive,
but l'm afraid there's been a mistake.

01:34:12.241 --> 01:34:13.299
Mistake?

01:34:13.409 --> 01:34:15.639
When they called me,
they really thought John walked out.

01:34:15.745 --> 01:34:19.203
He didn't. He's still trapped,
but they're working on him.

01:34:21.117 --> 01:34:22.641
ls he hurt bad?

01:34:22.752 --> 01:34:23.719
Oh, my God.

01:34:27.724 --> 01:34:29.954
Oh, this is not right.

01:34:30.059 --> 01:34:31.686
This is not right!

01:34:32.395 --> 01:34:34.329
He gave you everything,
years of his life!

01:34:34.430 --> 01:34:36.421
And you can't even get this right?

01:34:43.506 --> 01:34:45.940
Where is he? l'm going down there.

01:34:46.476 --> 01:34:49.070
l'm sorry, Mrs. McLoughlin.
lt's too dangerous.

01:34:51.848 --> 01:34:53.816
Where are they taking him?

01:34:54.317 --> 01:34:55.614
Bellevue.

01:34:57.153 --> 01:34:58.586
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

01:35:07.463 --> 01:35:09.522
Where do we take him
when we get him out?

01:35:09.632 --> 01:35:11.065
Triage at One Liberty.

01:35:11.167 --> 01:35:12.964
And what's the status of McLoughlin?

01:35:13.069 --> 01:35:14.798
He's further down.
We're still working on him.

01:35:19.409 --> 01:35:21.206
Easy, easy.

01:35:22.045 --> 01:35:24.240
We need more length! Kink it!

01:35:29.452 --> 01:35:30.919
What the hell?

01:35:32.422 --> 01:35:33.719
-103!
-Yeah.

01:35:34.757 --> 01:35:36.626
We need a line down here fast.

01:35:52.241 --> 01:35:55.335
Okay, breathe this. Breathe. Okay.

01:36:00.416 --> 01:36:01.974
Chuck, how's he doing?

01:36:02.618 --> 01:36:05.416
Blood pressure's holding. He's stable.

01:36:06.389 --> 01:36:08.857
But he's swelling,
and he's getting colder.

01:36:09.058 --> 01:36:10.355
Paddy!

01:36:11.094 --> 01:36:13.062
Get something to cover him, will you?

01:36:14.163 --> 01:36:15.528
Hey, Willy.

01:36:25.341 --> 01:36:29.209
Brother, take a blow. Take the blow.
We got fresh guys up there.

01:36:29.312 --> 01:36:30.370
All right.

01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.108
l got to get down below you.
We got a guy down below you.

01:36:43.059 --> 01:36:44.651
l'm sorry, Will.

01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:49.063
Why can't l ever get a female cop?

01:36:49.232 --> 01:36:50.859
At least somebody skinny.

01:36:51.534 --> 01:36:53.934
What do you want?
My wife's a great cook.

01:36:55.171 --> 01:36:56.763
She'd better be,

01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:00.138
'cause l'm bringing 20 people
to that barbecue you're giving for me.

01:37:00.243 --> 01:37:03.178
Scotty! They say
they can't control the fires.

01:37:03.446 --> 01:37:05.812
Building Four and Five
might come down.

01:37:06.215 --> 01:37:08.183
Nothing like a little pressure, right?

01:37:27.837 --> 01:37:30.328
God damn it. lt's not working.

01:37:30.606 --> 01:37:32.233
Try more cribbing.

01:37:36.045 --> 01:37:37.512
Chuck. Paddy.

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.247
Just get out of here.

01:37:39.482 --> 01:37:41.450
This whole damn thing
could come down on us.

01:37:41.784 --> 01:37:43.718
There's no sense in all of us
getting killed.

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.516
You gonna pry up that slab
and get him out of here yourself?

01:37:47.957 --> 01:37:49.686
l've been in and out of rehab for years.

01:37:49.792 --> 01:37:53.057
Finally figured out the only thing
l've ever been good at is helping people.

01:37:53.162 --> 01:37:54.629
We're doing this together.

01:37:55.298 --> 01:37:56.526
l ain't leaving.

01:37:56.632 --> 01:37:58.896
l don't mean to break up the moment,

01:37:59.001 --> 01:38:01.162
but we're all
getting out of here together.

01:38:04.640 --> 01:38:07.609
ls someone there? You got water?

01:38:08.544 --> 01:38:09.841
Who the hell's that?

01:38:10.279 --> 01:38:12.611
l told you. That was my partner.

01:38:13.382 --> 01:38:15.850
-Hey, John!
-l thought he was your partner.

01:38:16.219 --> 01:38:18.084
l'm almost out, okay?

01:38:18.721 --> 01:38:20.712
They're coming soon. l promise.

01:38:21.524 --> 01:38:23.617
-Okay, Will.
-Who's that?

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.725
McLoughlin.

01:38:26.028 --> 01:38:29.156
Scott Strauss, ESU. How you doing?

01:38:29.699 --> 01:38:32.725
l'm okay. Need water.

01:38:33.202 --> 01:38:36.933
We hear you. When we get Will out,
we're coming for you.

01:38:37.707 --> 01:38:40.335
We can't get anything to you
down there right now, John.

01:38:40.443 --> 01:38:42.070
There's just no room.

01:38:46.215 --> 01:38:47.477
This guy.

01:38:48.050 --> 01:38:50.848
He's gonna die
if you don't get him out soon.

01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:55.022
And the only thing in the way is my leg.
l want you to cut it off.

01:38:56.559 --> 01:38:58.754
Just cut it off. l can live without a leg.

01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:03.257
Okay.

01:39:06.769 --> 01:39:09.397
l'm not cutting your leg off. l can't.

01:39:10.206 --> 01:39:12.936
You're coming out in one piece,
you hear me?

01:39:13.042 --> 01:39:14.509
You gotta...

01:39:14.877 --> 01:39:18.506
Look, it's my leg.
Just juice me up and cut it off.

01:39:18.948 --> 01:39:21.644
lf he dies, l die. That's just the way it is.

01:39:21.884 --> 01:39:25.285
Look, Will,
your partner must be 20 feet deeper.

01:39:25.421 --> 01:39:27.651
Probably more compacted than you.

01:39:28.024 --> 01:39:31.983
Even if l cut your leg off, he's not gonna
get out of there for hours.

01:39:32.695 --> 01:39:35.323
l'm sorry, man. Now, let me do my work.

01:39:35.698 --> 01:39:37.495
We're going again!

01:39:41.604 --> 01:39:42.832
Hi.

01:39:44.707 --> 01:39:48.609
Ma'am, this is Allison Jimeno.
She's Will Jimeno's wife.

01:39:48.711 --> 01:39:50.804
l'm his sister.
We were told he was coming here.

01:39:50.913 --> 01:39:54.280
We're asking all the family members
to please wait in the cafeteria.

01:39:54.383 --> 01:39:55.975
lt's over there through the doors.

01:39:59.588 --> 01:40:00.953
l can't go in there.

01:40:01.057 --> 01:40:03.855
Come on.
We'll find someplace else, honey.

01:40:12.635 --> 01:40:13.795
Hand it over here, boss.

01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:15.367
Hey, John!

01:40:15.705 --> 01:40:18.833
They're coming!
You hang in there! Okay?

01:40:21.544 --> 01:40:23.205
l love you, John!

01:40:23.879 --> 01:40:25.642
l'm waiting for you!

01:40:30.219 --> 01:40:31.982
Don't give up, okay?

01:40:35.391 --> 01:40:36.688
Will.

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:38.657
Tell them

01:40:39.862 --> 01:40:43.320
l'm coming, too.

01:40:45.301 --> 01:40:46.768
You tell them.

01:40:47.169 --> 01:40:48.636
lt's great up here!

01:40:49.372 --> 01:40:51.340
lt's just so great!

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.568
Hey, where did the buildings go?

01:41:20.803 --> 01:41:22.430
Hey, where did the buildings go?

01:41:22.772 --> 01:41:25.104
They're gone, kid. They're gone.

01:41:25.708 --> 01:41:27.005
You're going home.

01:41:39.288 --> 01:41:40.949
You done it, Will.

01:41:43.459 --> 01:41:44.858
You done it.

01:41:47.363 --> 01:41:49.024
Go to your family.

01:42:07.550 --> 01:42:08.847
Who's there?

01:42:12.555 --> 01:42:15.115
No, not yet.

01:42:27.670 --> 01:42:29.137
Can you hear me?

01:42:34.410 --> 01:42:35.638
Not yet.

01:42:41.250 --> 01:42:42.342
John?

01:42:43.486 --> 01:42:45.954
John, can you hear me?

01:42:46.055 --> 01:42:47.522
-John!
-Easy, Scott.

01:42:47.623 --> 01:42:48.749
Scotty?

01:42:48.858 --> 01:42:51.452
-Down here.
-Coming to you. l'm good.

01:42:52.495 --> 01:42:55.623
-l'm coming.
-lt's tight.

01:42:55.731 --> 01:42:58.529
l think l see him, Lou. l got him.

01:42:58.767 --> 01:43:00.826
-ls he awake?
-Semi.

01:43:01.837 --> 01:43:04.431
John? John, can you hear me?

01:43:06.041 --> 01:43:09.533
John! l'm Scott, from ESU 5.
Man, l'm not gonna leave you.

01:43:09.645 --> 01:43:12.478
l'm gonna do whatever l can
to get you out of here. All right?

01:43:12.581 --> 01:43:14.139
-lt's tight, Lou.
-All right.

01:43:14.250 --> 01:43:15.615
-Just send it back.
-All right.

01:43:15.718 --> 01:43:18.016
Find a place to put debris.

01:43:18.554 --> 01:43:20.818
Louie, bring it back.
l got an elevator shaft here.

01:43:20.923 --> 01:43:22.220
You're gonna be all right, John.

01:43:22.324 --> 01:43:24.258
-We're not leaving you.
-Bring the Sawall down.

01:43:33.335 --> 01:43:35.599
Hang in there, John. Come on.
You'll be all right.

01:43:35.704 --> 01:43:39.003
Stay with us, John. Come on.
We got you.

01:43:45.281 --> 01:43:48.842
<i>We're transporting Jimeno to Bellevue.
Have a trauma team standing by.</i>

01:43:48.951 --> 01:43:54.116
<i>Respiration's 26, B.P. is 90 over 58.
Got him on 15 liters O2.</i>

01:43:54.456 --> 01:43:56.924
Room's prepped.
Take him all the way down to the end.

01:43:58.894 --> 01:44:02.125
Hey, they brought him in the back.
Come on.

01:44:07.002 --> 01:44:08.196
This way.

01:44:10.706 --> 01:44:12.003
Over here.

01:44:24.086 --> 01:44:25.713
Oh, my God.

01:44:26.855 --> 01:44:28.823
He's breathing out rocks.

01:44:30.059 --> 01:44:32.892
Will? Can you hear me?

01:44:33.596 --> 01:44:34.893
Hey, baby.

01:44:35.297 --> 01:44:37.891
Oh, baby, are you okay?

01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:40.197
We're taking him to the O.R. now.

01:44:40.336 --> 01:44:42.827
They said your leg was broke.

01:44:44.673 --> 01:44:46.300
Will, baby?

01:44:47.710 --> 01:44:49.337
They told me you were all right.

01:44:56.652 --> 01:44:58.882
l want you to name her Olivia.

01:45:02.891 --> 01:45:04.825
No, l want Alyssa.

01:45:05.761 --> 01:45:07.058
For you.

01:45:09.465 --> 01:45:10.830
Olivia.

01:45:11.166 --> 01:45:13.691
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
take him up to O.R.

01:45:13.802 --> 01:45:16.066
lt'll be better for him
if you come with us, ma'am.

01:45:16.505 --> 01:45:17.472
Will.

01:45:19.875 --> 01:45:21.433
He'll be okay, right?

01:45:22.044 --> 01:45:23.443
There are some complications,

01:45:23.545 --> 01:45:25.570
-but we've given him good...
-Will?

01:45:26.448 --> 01:45:29.645
l'm going to name her Olivia, okay?

01:45:30.619 --> 01:45:31.916
Okay.

01:45:37.159 --> 01:45:39.889
John? You got two big slabs
on your chest.

01:45:39.995 --> 01:45:41.826
lt's the only way we're gonna
get you out of here, all right?

01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:44.091
l got the big one, you got the little one.

01:45:47.770 --> 01:45:49.169
Pull it off.

01:45:51.940 --> 01:45:53.498
All right. John. We got one more.

01:45:53.609 --> 01:45:55.543
One more, brother,
and we got your chest clear.

01:45:55.644 --> 01:45:57.271
We got a good start.

01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.414
-Joe-Joe?
-Yeah?

01:46:01.116 --> 01:46:03.311
Tell Lieutenant
to get a paramedic down here.

01:46:03.419 --> 01:46:06.183
-We got to get an lV in him now.
-All right.

01:46:07.022 --> 01:46:09.149
We're gonna need a paramedic
down here now!

01:46:10.459 --> 01:46:11.949
Come on, John. We're almost there.

01:46:12.061 --> 01:46:13.323
McLoughlin.

01:46:14.763 --> 01:46:17.493
You're in good hands, John.
You're getting out of here.

01:46:17.599 --> 01:46:20.864
That's it, John. That's it.
Hang in there, brother.

01:46:21.403 --> 01:46:24.167
That's it. Hang in there, John.
Don't give up.

01:46:24.273 --> 01:46:27.208
Don't give up. We didn't give up.
Don't you give up.

01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:30.273
John, can you hear me?

01:46:30.646 --> 01:46:31.840
John, wake up.

01:46:31.947 --> 01:46:36.247
That's it, John, wake up. Stay with us.
Don't go nowhere.

01:46:40.923 --> 01:46:43.118
Come on, John. Come on, John.

01:46:44.159 --> 01:46:48.892
Stay with us, John. Don't give up.
Come on, brother. Hang in there.

01:46:49.064 --> 01:46:50.361
-John.
-Come on, John.

01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.668
Hang in there, brother.
Hang in there. Come on.

01:46:54.036 --> 01:46:57.836
We're almost home.
We're almost home, man.

01:46:57.940 --> 01:46:58.907
Come on.

01:47:01.210 --> 01:47:02.837
Stay with us, brother.

01:47:13.722 --> 01:47:15.212
l let you down.

01:47:18.827 --> 01:47:21.694
All these years, l've been so careful.

01:47:23.298 --> 01:47:24.822
Now l screw up.

01:47:26.402 --> 01:47:28.029
l'm sorry.

01:47:37.646 --> 01:47:40.513
Did l ever love you enough, honey?

01:47:42.151 --> 01:47:43.448
l mean,

01:47:44.686 --> 01:47:49.020
did l love you good
like l was supposed to?

01:47:53.962 --> 01:47:56.260
What the hell happened?

01:47:58.967 --> 01:48:00.696
<i>l think we had it, John.</i>

01:48:03.639 --> 01:48:05.504
lt was in the moments.

01:48:09.178 --> 01:48:11.271
Happens to most people, l guess.

01:48:11.814 --> 01:48:14.612
Me with the kids,
and you with the department.

01:48:16.885 --> 01:48:18.853
Somewhere along the way

01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:23.658
l guess we kind of stopped looking
at each other.

01:48:27.796 --> 01:48:29.593
Come home, honey.

01:48:30.399 --> 01:48:32.026
The kids need you.

01:48:34.837 --> 01:48:35.963
No.

01:48:39.408 --> 01:48:40.773
l need you.

01:48:41.710 --> 01:48:43.109
Donna.

01:48:43.812 --> 01:48:45.040
l can't.

01:48:46.348 --> 01:48:48.111
l can't get out of here.

01:48:48.817 --> 01:48:51.615
Honey, the kitchen's
not even finished yet.

01:48:52.988 --> 01:48:56.116
Okay. Would you get off the kitchen?

01:48:57.459 --> 01:48:59.393
ls this necessary?

01:49:00.062 --> 01:49:02.997
-l'm stuck.
-Then get unstuck.

01:49:03.732 --> 01:49:05.632
Get off your ass, John.

01:49:06.535 --> 01:49:09.265
Just get up and come home.

01:49:10.038 --> 01:49:12.472
Donna, l can't. l...

01:49:17.713 --> 01:49:19.180
<i>You can do it.</i>

01:49:21.717 --> 01:49:23.014
John?

01:49:25.654 --> 01:49:28.316
What's taking so long? Hey, you guys!

01:49:57.553 --> 01:50:01.489
<i>One thing he said,
of all the images we've seen,</i>

01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:04.759
<i>it is a scene of New Yorkers calmly</i>

01:50:05.694 --> 01:50:07.093
<i>evacuating...</i>

01:50:07.195 --> 01:50:08.253
Great.

01:50:08.430 --> 01:50:10.398
lt's not working. Don't bother.

01:50:14.703 --> 01:50:16.694
Waiting's shit, isn't it?

01:50:17.906 --> 01:50:20.067
lf it's gonna be bad,
you just want to know it. No bullshit.

01:50:20.175 --> 01:50:21.506
That's right.

01:50:21.610 --> 01:50:24.272
They're digging my husband out.
They found him in the rubble.

01:50:25.213 --> 01:50:26.612
That's good.

01:50:29.718 --> 01:50:31.948
My son's down there. Lawrence.

01:50:33.855 --> 01:50:37.484
He's the elevator operator
in the South Tower. A good boy.

01:50:41.363 --> 01:50:44.730
When l saw that building going down
like a pancake...

01:50:50.872 --> 01:50:53.170
Damn thing is, l yelled at him.

01:50:55.177 --> 01:50:57.304
Last time, l...

01:51:00.048 --> 01:51:01.845
l made dinner.

01:51:04.319 --> 01:51:07.550
He got held up at work.
Food went to waste.

01:51:10.359 --> 01:51:11.826
And l yelled.

01:51:14.529 --> 01:51:16.656
Now all l want to do is hold him.

01:51:17.699 --> 01:51:18.996

Thank you. Thank you.

01:53:12.948 --> 01:53:14.506
lt'll be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

01:53:14.616 --> 01:53:15.776
Thank you.

01:53:15.884 --> 01:53:17.852
-We got you, buddy.
-Hang in there, man.

01:53:17.953 --> 01:53:19.921
-Hang in there.
-Hang in there, John.

01:53:20.021 --> 01:53:22.990
-Good job.
-We got you, man. We got you.

01:53:23.191 --> 01:53:25.091
You're going home, John.
You're going home.

01:53:25.193 --> 01:53:26.683
-Way to go, man.
-Thank you.

01:53:26.795 --> 01:53:28.956
-Welcome home.
-God bless you, John.

01:53:29.064 --> 01:53:30.224
Thank you.

01:53:30.332 --> 01:53:32.630
Way to go. Way to go, guy.

01:54:06.368 --> 01:54:07.460
John?

01:54:08.236 --> 01:54:09.965
-Hi.
-Donna.

01:54:10.071 --> 01:54:11.299
Hi, baby.

01:54:13.041 --> 01:54:14.440
John.

01:54:15.443 --> 01:54:18.412
You kept me

01:54:19.681 --> 01:54:21.308
alive.

01:55:41.796 --> 01:55:43.525
You guys come
all the way from Wisconsin?

01:55:43.632 --> 01:55:45.998
Yeah, those bastards.
We had to do something.

01:55:47.168 --> 01:55:48.396
You want a brat?

01:55:48.503 --> 01:55:49.902
Finest brat you'll get in the whole world.

01:55:50.005 --> 01:55:51.802
That's a guarantee you can take
to the bank, mister.

01:55:51.907 --> 01:55:53.204
Yeah, sure.

01:55:54.109 --> 01:55:55.736
What are you doing down here?

01:55:58.446 --> 01:56:00.744
-Paramedic.
-Atta way.

01:56:09.958 --> 01:56:12.085
No, l'm not coming in today.

01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:16.327
l don't know.

01:56:18.633 --> 01:56:23.332
They're going to need some good men
out there to avenge this.

01:56:26.641 --> 01:56:27.938
We'll see.

01:56:33.682 --> 01:56:36.947
Jimeno just got out.
McLoughlin's still in surgery.

01:56:37.385 --> 01:56:38.750
We're still missing 1 4.

01:56:38.853 --> 01:56:40.980
Jesus. What do we do?

01:56:42.691 --> 01:56:46.388
Thousands of people in there, Paddy.
Where the hell are they?

01:58:23.291 --> 01:58:26.590
<i>9/1 1 showed us
what human beings are capable of.</i>

01:58:27.429 --> 01:58:29.727
<i>The evil, yeah, sure.</i>

01:58:30.665 --> 01:58:34.226
<i>But it also brought out a goodness
we forgot could exist.</i>

01:58:37.539 --> 01:58:39.871
<i>People taking care of each other</i>

01:58:42.143 --> 01:58:43.542
<i>for no other reason</i>

01:58:45.013 --> 01:58:47.140
<i>than it was the right thing to do.</i>

01:58:47.882 --> 01:58:50.851
-That's my son, JJ.
-JJ, l'm Tim.

01:58:51.386 --> 01:58:54.913
<i>lt's important for us
to talk about that good, to remember.</i>

01:58:55.323 --> 01:58:56.915

01:58:57.025 --> 01:58:59.493
Hi. How are you? Good to see you. Hi.
