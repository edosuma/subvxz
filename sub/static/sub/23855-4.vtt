01:28.463 --> 01:29.631
[Fish sighs]

01:31.466 --> 01:32.425
Excuse me.

01:33.760 --> 01:34.719
[exhales]

01:35.762 --> 01:36.930
[sighs heavily]

01:37.013 --> 01:37.931
[sniffles]

01:40.517 --> 01:42.101
Don't give me that look. I'm starving.

01:48.483 --> 01:49.943
This is a waste of time.

01:50.860 --> 01:54.114
What? Half the job is sitting around,
waiting around in a car.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.368
-You want a coconut cream? You sure?
-Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.622
-Just don't do anything illegal. Okay?
-[laughs]

02:02.705 --> 02:06.876
Well, half of my job is cleaning up cases
when cops cut corners.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.170
Okay, try saying that
five times in a row real fast.

02:09.254 --> 02:12.423
Cleaning up cases when cops cut corners.
Cleaning up cases when cops cut corners.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.300
Cleaning up cases-- I can't do it.

02:15.885 --> 02:20.557
We're gonna have a conversation
in a public place with this, uh...

02:21.558 --> 02:25.228
Ka-- Kaduche-- Kadeuce... Kadeuce Porter.

02:26.855 --> 02:30.191
Fucking crazy, the shit you can find
online with a cell phone number, isn't it?

02:31.109 --> 02:32.610
You ever look yourself up?

02:32.694 --> 02:35.530
I'm going to look you up
and see what "KJ" stands for.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.658
It doesn't stand for anything.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.202
My dad gave me the nickname.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.663
Gotta stand for something.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.040
Nope.

02:48.209 --> 02:51.754
He said the world would take me
on my merits if they thought I was a man.

02:51.838 --> 02:57.218
So I put "KJ" on my college applications
and every job application,

02:57.302 --> 02:59.262
and I think he was right.

03:00.221 --> 03:03.516
I think it opened a lot of doors
that otherwise would have stayed closed.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.270
-Cynical.
-It's reality.

03:09.188 --> 03:11.858
That explains why you're plea bargaining
shoplifting cases.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.694
You know, talking about,
don't you gotta be in court,

03:14.777 --> 03:15.820
work your other jobs?

03:15.904 --> 03:17.530
The other half of my job is paperwork,

03:17.614 --> 03:20.450
and I would be working
if you'd shut up for half a second.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.451
[laughs]

03:21.826 --> 03:23.828
[Fish] Sure you don't want
that coconut cream?

03:24.412 --> 03:27.832

you came in with, sir?

Yeah.

[indistinct police radio chatter]

03:58.863 --> 04:00.156
Yo, what'd they do to you?

04:04.953 --> 04:06.704
I didn't tell Tricey that you were...

04:07.121 --> 04:08.373
She even ask?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.299
[Latrice] 'Saiah?

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
Who's there?

04:22.178 --> 04:23.680
It's us, Tricey.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.107
[Latrice] 'Saiah? Is that you?

04:34.607 --> 04:37.443
'Saiah. Where you been?
I've been waiting all night.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.237
-I, uh--
-Look, look, look. Look.

04:40.571 --> 04:43.449
Look, I found that in Brenton's things
from the hospital.

04:44.075 --> 04:47.787
There was a white man in his room
that first night we were there and...

04:47.870 --> 04:48.913
[breath trembling]

04:48.997 --> 04:51.833
I found this. I found it in Brenton's bed.

04:51.916 --> 04:53.751
Why would he have one of his seagulls?

04:54.460 --> 04:56.087
So we gotta go to the police.

04:56.170 --> 04:59.132
We gotta let them know about this man
because maybe he might know something.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.759
He might know who did this to Brenton,
so we gotta go.

05:01.843 --> 05:05.179
Latrice, how many days has it been
since the repast?

05:06.723 --> 05:07.724
What have you been doing?

05:09.392 --> 05:11.561
[Seth] I'll clean up, Tricey.
You go on and rest.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.104
Did you hear what I said, 'Saiah?

05:14.105 --> 05:16.399
'Saiah, I saw a man in Brenton's room.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.943
[Seth] They had people going in and out
around the clock.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.903
It could've been anybody
from the hospital.

05:22.113 --> 05:26.034
-Why would they leave this in his bed?
-Did you actually see him put it there?

05:26.117 --> 05:27.577
-Did you?
-No.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.287
But...

05:29.954 --> 05:31.456
How else would it get there?

05:32.415 --> 05:33.499
You know B.

05:34.167 --> 05:38.963
All right? He always had one of those
seagulls he was working on with him.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.675
-We gotta go to the police, right now.
-I've heard enough.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.680
I gotta go to work, do you hear me?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.475
[Latrice stammers]

05:51.017 --> 05:52.727
-Come on now.
-Isaiah--

05:52.810 --> 05:55.354
Now this house ain't fit enough
for animals to live in.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.109
[door opens]

06:00.193 --> 06:01.694
[Pete] Get your hands back. Feet back.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.822
You stay up against that fence.
You do not turn around.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.824
-Fucking--
-Look at the fucking ground!

06:06.908 --> 06:08.117
I'm not gonna tell you again!

06:08.201 --> 06:10.286
[Wilcox] Find anything in there? Anything?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.455
Spread your fucking legs! Spread 'em!

06:13.081 --> 06:15.625
All right, put your shit up. Come on.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.752
Hands up. Hands--
Spread your legs. Spread 'em more.

06:17.835 --> 06:19.295
-Do not turn around!
-Let me see.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.881
Take it all off, fat boy.
I know you're holding the stash.

06:21.964 --> 06:24.300
The fuck you hassling us for, man?
We not doing nothing.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.928
No drive-thru you've been running
for the past two hours?

06:27.011 --> 06:28.096
No, that ain't nothing?

06:28.179 --> 06:31.224
[DiAngelo] Little birdie told us
you fuckheads are moving a serious stash.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.809
Don't know nothing about nothing, man.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.853
This one's clean.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.980
What I say, man?
We was just out here chilling.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.900
You and your boys are just out here
having breakfast, right?

06:40.983 --> 06:42.568
The fuck is this?

06:42.652 --> 06:46.030

Breakfast of champions.

06:46.739 --> 06:49.242
[DiAngelo] And we're the reason
these kids are dying young?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.035
Gonna make it real simple.

06:51.119 --> 06:54.455
You tell me where that stash is,
I won't lock your ugly ass up.

06:55.164 --> 06:58.042
For real, if I knew what you was
talking about, man, I'd help you out.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.043
I'm serious.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.088
Fat boy's only got a couple of dime bags,
DiAngelo. That's it.

07:02.171 --> 07:03.172
I got nothing.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.092
You said this tip was solid.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.427
Bad intel. Sorry, man.

07:13.474 --> 07:15.226

07:16.936 --> 07:18.020
Cut them loose.

Except for Fat Albert,
we're taking him in.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.483
All this for a couple
of fucking dime bags, man!

07:22.567 --> 07:24.569
You heard the man.
Hurry the fuck up. Cut me loose.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.070
Turn around. The fuck outta here.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.698
Let's go, get your bag, get your shit,
let's go.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.324

-Hands behind your back.
-Hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

07:33.077 --> 07:34.954
-Grab your boots and go.
-Turn around.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.635
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler.
How can I help you?

08:31.511 --> 08:35.139
I saw a man in my son's room
and we need to find him.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.434
There's a man in your son's bedroom?

08:38.518 --> 08:42.271
No, no, at the hospital.
I saw a man at the hospital.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.359
[inhales shakily]

08:46.442 --> 08:50.404
Uh, and I think he--
he left something with Brenton.

-[paper rustling]
<i>-One of his seagulls.</i>

08:52.532 --> 08:55.785
<i>It might've already been in his things.</i>
<i>I'm... I'm not sure.</i>

08:58.913 --> 09:02.124
My own husband doesn't believe me
right now. I need to know...

09:03.543 --> 09:05.378
I need to know if you do.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.756
Are you alone right now, Mrs. Butler?

09:08.839 --> 09:12.885
What does that matter?
I'm not making this up, I'm not crazy.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.972
I didn't say that, Mrs. Butler. Uh...

09:17.223 --> 09:18.641
Can you describe this man?

09:19.100 --> 09:23.145
[Latrice]<i> I think so. I don't know.</i>

09:23.229 --> 09:24.063
Well...

09:25.314 --> 09:27.650
You should talk to a sketch artist
at my office.

09:27.733 --> 09:29.318
<i>Okay? It's on Newark Avenue,</i>

09:29.402 --> 09:32.196

[whispers] Can...

09:36.033 --> 09:36.867
Can...

09:37.702 --> 09:39.036
Can you meet me there?

09:39.453 --> 09:41.831
Yes. Yes. Of course I'll meet you.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.584

11:10.211 --> 11:12.671
-Don't know shit about no Brenton Butler.
-Mm.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.050
You just got a thing
for funerals then, huh?

11:16.133 --> 11:18.010
-I wasn't at no funeral either.
-Oh, okay.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.679
That settles it. You can go.
You want your phone back?

11:22.807 --> 11:26.602
Go ahead. Take it. We're done here.
I'm just gonna make a quick call.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.482
[phone rings and vibrates]

11:33.943 --> 11:35.069
It's playing our song.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.322
Why does Brenton Butler
have your number?

11:38.406 --> 11:41.700
Why is your phone number
the only fucking number

11:41.784 --> 11:43.327
in Brenton Butler's burner?

11:43.411 --> 11:45.663
-Don't know shit about that.
-He dealing drugs for you?

11:45.746 --> 11:48.499
-Man, fuck you.
-No, fuck you, motherfucker!

11:48.582 --> 11:50.626
-Get the fuck off me!
-Piece of shit!

11:50.709 --> 11:54.338
You don't seem too shook up
that you got your phone friend killed.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.048
I ain't get nobody killed, man!

11:56.715 --> 11:58.884
Nobody in the game
dumb enough to fuck with a Five King.

11:58.968 --> 11:59.927
Somebody did.

12:00.010 --> 12:01.637
Was it you, asshole?

12:07.518 --> 12:08.561
Look at that.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.109
Isn't that sweet? You and little Brenton.
It was in your room.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.155
Look at it.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.827
You gonna tell me now that
you don't know a Brenton Butler?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.834
We're just trying to find out
who killed your friend, okay?

12:37.715 --> 12:39.383
I don't know no Brenton Butler.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.594
[sighs]

12:43.220 --> 12:46.515
All right, well, we're gonna have
to keep you in County for the day.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.767
Fuck, you know what? It's Friday.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.811
Means you won't be arraigned
till after the weekend.

12:50.895 --> 12:54.231
I don't give a fuck.
It's warmer in here than out there.

12:54.815 --> 12:57.234
So go ahead. [sighs]

13:05.201 --> 13:06.702
Can you get him the fuck out of here?

13:10.122 --> 13:11.373
Get off me, man.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.791
Get the fuck off me!

13:16.086 --> 13:17.755
That was a waste of time.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.513
Oh.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.683
[exhales] Fuck.

13:32.061 --> 13:34.730
Can you describe
the size and shape of his face?

13:38.859 --> 13:39.944
Um...

13:40.027 --> 13:43.447
He was wearing a... like a hoodie.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.158
So it was... it was covering up...

13:46.825 --> 13:48.786
uh, some of his face.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.622
So, no. What about eye color?

13:52.915 --> 13:54.041
Um, I guess...

13:54.917 --> 13:56.585
I guess the hoodie was...

13:58.379 --> 14:00.214
I guess it was covering up his eyes.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.049
You couldn't see his eyes?

14:02.132 --> 14:04.677
[clears throat]
What about the shape of his nose?

14:04.760 --> 14:05.761
Um...

14:05.844 --> 14:08.389
[inhales] Is Ms. Harper coming?

14:08.472 --> 14:10.432

44:24.995 --> 44:26.080
Huh? Yeah!

44:26.580 --> 44:28.207
-Don't bite her.
-Hey.

44:29.416 --> 44:30.542
[Fish sighs]

44:31.418 --> 44:32.419
It's, uh...

44:33.295 --> 44:35.631
food prep night here.

44:35.714 --> 44:38.092
I'm mixing the hamburger
with the gizzards

44:38.175 --> 44:40.511
and these, uh, these flax seeds.

44:41.303 --> 44:42.805
They like their liver too.

44:43.847 --> 44:44.848
I know.

44:44.932 --> 44:47.184
Pretty crazy weekend here.

44:47.726 --> 44:49.228
Have to call the fire marshal,

44:49.645 --> 44:52.731
shut this rager down
before it gets out of hand, you know?

44:53.774 --> 44:55.734
Oh, you want a drink? You want a drink.

44:55.818 --> 44:59.113
You know, I think I got some Rumple Minze
somewhere here from New Year's.

44:59.196 --> 45:00.447
I'm good. Thanks.

45:01.448 --> 45:02.616
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

45:03.909 --> 45:07.079
-Uh... how'd it go with the witness?
-Ugh!

45:07.162 --> 45:09.289
I could've told you that over the phone.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.835
Uh, she is a real pistol, man.
I'm telling you.

45:12.918 --> 45:16.004
I-I hope that a night in lockup
will, uh...

45:16.755 --> 45:18.215
cool her out. You know?

45:18.298 --> 45:19.758
-Great.
-Yeah.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.553
-That's really great.
-Yeah. Yeah.

45:23.345 --> 45:28.183
But tonight is just
Fish's famous four-legged feast.

45:28.267 --> 45:29.143
Hey.

45:30.644 --> 45:31.478
What are you doing?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.565
What-- Why-- Oh.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.651
-Hey, what are you doing that for?
-Um...

45:37.734 --> 45:39.319
You know, it's-- it's not a big deal.

45:39.403 --> 45:41.155
It's a big deal to me. Where you going?

45:44.241 --> 45:46.785
-I should go.
-Hey. No, wait. No, KJ.

45:47.661 --> 45:49.663
Don't go out there
and do something stupid.

45:49.746 --> 45:51.165
[sobbing]

45:51.248 --> 45:53.167
Hey! Whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, stop.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.835
Stop that right now. Stop that.

45:56.628 --> 45:58.464
I just fuck--

45:58.547 --> 46:01.383
I just fuck everything up.

46:01.925 --> 46:03.218
You think you're a fuck up?

46:03.302 --> 46:06.889
My kid doesn't want to see me anymore.
That's right.

46:06.972 --> 46:08.891
Because I'm such a shitty fucking dad.

46:10.976 --> 46:14.354
Now she's all grown up and that's it.
No second chances, no do-overs, nada.

46:16.315 --> 46:20.527
Listen, just stay here
and we can both hate ourselves together.

46:20.986 --> 46:23.864
Why waste a perfectly good
Saturday night?

46:29.786 --> 46:32.331
If you're trying to get me to sleep
with you, it's not gonna work.

46:32.414 --> 46:33.499
[laughs]

46:33.582 --> 46:35.876
You want-- You want--
You want a liver sandwich?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.669
-[scoffs]
-[laughs]

46:37.753 --> 46:40.672
I'd offer you gizzards,
but Lizzie will tear your throat out.

46:41.048 --> 46:42.257
Come on.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.884
Come on!

46:43.967 --> 46:45.302
[KJ] I don't like liver.

46:45.844 --> 46:47.137
[siren wailing]

46:50.641 --> 46:51.475
[sniffs]

46:51.558 --> 46:53.977
I can't remember the last
home-cooked meal I had.

46:54.061 --> 46:55.479
Don't get your hopes up too high.

46:55.562 --> 46:58.899
Roast beef is Isaiah's favorite,
and I haven't made it in a while.

46:58.982 --> 46:59.816
[door opens, closes]

46:59.900 --> 47:01.693
Just in time. I hope you're hungry.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.196
[Seth] Yeah, we got some fine cuts
from Zeke's.

47:04.279 --> 47:06.949
You know, he's still running
that broke-ass joint down on Duncan.

47:07.574 --> 47:09.618
How dare you come into my house
after what you did?

47:09.701 --> 47:11.411
'Saiah! Oh, my God!

47:11.495 --> 47:13.205
[grunting]

47:13.288 --> 47:14.373
No! Seth!

47:15.165 --> 47:16.124
Seth!

47:16.208 --> 47:17.584
[grunting]

47:17.668 --> 47:18.794
Seth, stop!

47:18.877 --> 47:21.129
Stop! Stop!

47:21.213 --> 47:22.214
-No!
-Blood money.

47:22.297 --> 47:25.217
After all I sacrificed to raise you right,
this is how you do me?

47:25.300 --> 47:27.469
Somebody gotta pay them bills,
it wasn't gonna be you.

47:27.553 --> 47:29.137
Know your place or I'll put you in it.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.347
[laughs]

47:30.430 --> 47:31.598
[clapping] Woo!

47:31.682 --> 47:34.476
That's how your God talk through you?
Halle-fucking-lujah.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.186
-Mother--
-Stop it! Isaiah!

47:36.270 --> 47:38.272
He used drug money from that gang!

47:39.398 --> 47:41.483
I don't want you interfering
with my family.

47:41.567 --> 47:44.736
Where was your God when Brenton
lay bleeding down in that ditch?

47:44.820 --> 47:45.904
Hmm?

47:45.988 --> 47:49.366
And you sitting up in here,
telling his mama that God got a plan?

47:49.449 --> 47:50.284
What?

47:50.701 --> 47:52.995
To let B die down there like a beat dog?

47:53.078 --> 47:55.038
If that's God's plan, he's a fucking punk.

47:55.122 --> 47:56.456
Don't blaspheme in my house!

47:56.540 --> 47:57.874
This house, this house,

47:57.958 --> 48:00.711
it's the only thing you care about,
the only thing you ever loved!

48:00.794 --> 48:03.797
I provided a better life for my family
because that's what a man does.

48:03.880 --> 48:04.965
[Latrice] Calm down.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.426
Don't tell me about responsibility, boy!

48:07.509 --> 48:09.928
-Isaiah.
-Oh, you took care of your family, huh?

48:10.345 --> 48:15.017
What a father does is know his son...
to the core, to the bones!

48:15.475 --> 48:16.935
What he loves, what he hates...

48:17.352 --> 48:20.480
what makes him cry with joy and pain,
and everything in between!

48:20.564 --> 48:22.232
Seth, calm down.

48:22.774 --> 48:25.402
You tell me one thing you know
about your son.

48:29.781 --> 48:32.034
It was the only thing
Brenton ever wanted...

48:33.577 --> 48:35.829
for his father to know him.

48:42.961 --> 48:44.671
All you had to do was ask.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.885
[door opens, closes]

49:25.003 --> 49:26.338
Yo, man, what you need?

49:26.421 --> 49:27.255
Oh, fuck!

49:27.339 --> 49:29.800
A bag of Red Hots to go with my donuts.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.551
The breakfast of champions.

49:39.309 --> 49:42.062
What the fuck you doing here?
I gave everyone the night off.

49:42.521 --> 49:45.315
I want to talk about the bust
Wilcox ran point on.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.525
Yeah?

49:46.608 --> 49:49.444
Junkie left half a burger.
You want something to go with that?

49:49.528 --> 49:52.698
Yeah, so, time to time,
Wilcox sticks his head up his ass.

49:52.781 --> 49:54.491
That's what I want to talk about.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.704
This wasn't one of those times.

50:02.958 --> 50:05.043
Drugs here will fetch us
a couple hundred each.

50:06.128 --> 50:07.170
I want in.

50:08.338 --> 50:09.965
The same cut as everyone else.

50:16.471 --> 50:18.348
Should've bagged that out on the street.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.935
You know the rules
of proper evidence handling.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.605
I ain't wired, ain't IA.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.441
Ain't out for nothing but a way in.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.069
I got a family to think about now.

50:31.945 --> 50:34.948
I need them to be taken care of
if something happens to me.

50:36.450 --> 50:39.745
That kid on the bike in the park
was just a banger like the rest.

50:40.662 --> 50:42.372
Well, the animal got what he deserved.

50:42.998 --> 50:45.792
I'll do what it takes. I ain't no coward.

50:48.962 --> 50:52.132
What, are you fucking stupid
bringing this shit into the station?

50:52.883 --> 50:55.761
Our business stays on the street.
You got it?

50:57.304 --> 50:58.847
You clean all that shit up.

51:00.682 --> 51:02.184
Meet me outside in five.

51:17.824 --> 51:20.577
[lift creaking, whirring]

51:55.737 --> 51:58.281
[metal creaking]

52:33.316 --> 52:34.651
Your bus is coming.

52:38.572 --> 52:40.115
That was Five King's money.

52:41.783 --> 52:44.119
I don't want to have nothing
to do with that.

52:45.161 --> 52:46.830
He was just trying to help.

52:53.461 --> 52:55.130
You okay with going back to work?

53:00.594 --> 53:02.470
Only have one shift
at the slaughterhouse today,

53:02.554 --> 53:04.556
so I'll be back around six or seven.

53:05.682 --> 53:06.683
Okay.

53:49.059 --> 53:50.977
[kids chattering]

54:38.775 --> 54:40.276
You're so fucked.

54:40.944 --> 54:43.154
I'm gonna tell everyone
you kidnapped and raped me.

54:45.365 --> 54:48.994
You're being charged
with possession of a narcotic, vagrancy,

54:49.077 --> 54:51.538
resisting arrest,
and assaulting an officer.

54:53.373 --> 54:56.501
What? So yesterday you were good cop,
today you're bad cop? Not gonna work.

54:57.085 --> 55:00.880
Up until your trial, you're going
to be held at a community youth house.

55:00.964 --> 55:03.800
Sentence begins, gonna be transferred
to a woman's correctional facility

55:03.883 --> 55:06.386
where you're gonna do four to seven
years, depending on behavior.

55:06.469 --> 55:09.514
And I'm guessing with you,
it's going to be closer to seven.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.226
-[sighs]
-[keyboard clacking]

55:14.811 --> 55:16.646
I saw three guys in the park.

55:18.398 --> 55:21.276
They got in their car and they drove off.
That's it, that's all I saw.

55:21.359 --> 55:23.278
-Can I please go now?
-What kind of car?

55:23.361 --> 55:24.404
I don't know.

55:26.906 --> 55:30.243
It was black.
Black with a red stripe on it.

55:31.619 --> 55:33.246
We need a signature right here and right--

55:33.329 --> 55:35.123
That's what I saw! I'm not lying!

55:36.958 --> 55:39.002
How'd you see that car?
How'd you see these guys?

55:39.085 --> 55:41.212
I was sleeping in that old power plant.

55:41.296 --> 55:44.340
I go up there to sleep sometimes.
And I heard this...

55:44.841 --> 55:46.092
this sound and--

55:46.176 --> 55:49.054
I mean, I didn't do anything,
but then it got real quiet after a while,

55:49.137 --> 55:51.306
so I got up, and that's when I saw them.

55:51.389 --> 55:53.350
I swear to fucking God, I'm not lying.

55:53.433 --> 55:54.893
[phone vibrates]

55:57.353 --> 55:58.605
Don't go anywhere.

56:02.358 --> 56:03.610
Hey, Mama, what you wearing?

56:03.693 --> 56:04.861
[laughs]

56:04.944 --> 56:06.404
Yeah, in your dreams.

56:07.155 --> 56:08.198
Nadine awake yet?

56:08.281 --> 56:09.824
Yeah. I'm talking to her right now.

56:09.908 --> 56:13.328
She says she a black car, not a blue car.
A black car with a red stripe.

56:13.411 --> 56:15.205
Wait. Wait, wait. What color was the car?

56:15.288 --> 56:17.415
<i>A black car with a red stripe. Why?</i>

56:17.499 --> 56:20.835
<i>-Doesn't know what she's talking about.</i>
-Just keep her there, okay?

56:20.919 --> 56:21.836
I'm on my way.

56:21.920 --> 56:23.880
[DiAngelo] Fifty dollars.
You know that, right?

56:23.963 --> 56:26.007
All right. What you got? What you got?

56:26.966 --> 56:28.384
Let's go, let's go.

56:34.432 --> 56:35.558
[Fish] So here's the deal.

56:35.642 --> 56:38.978
We're gonna sit tight
until my assistant prosecutor shows up,

56:39.062 --> 56:40.563
and then give your statement to her.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.023
-Yo, what's up?
-Not much. You?

56:42.107 --> 56:44.025
-Oh!
-Huh?

56:44.109 --> 56:46.152
What happened?
Your boyfriend forget the safe word?

56:46.236 --> 56:48.822
[laughing] Yeah, I said chimichurri
instead of chimichanga.

56:48.905 --> 56:50.323
He got all confused, you know.

56:50.406 --> 56:51.699
[both laugh]

57:03.461 --> 57:04.629
[chuckles]

57:15.348 --> 57:17.350
-What?
-[DiAngelo] You owe me money.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.894
Fifty dollars. Get it done.

57:20.854 --> 57:21.688
All right.

57:23.523 --> 57:25.567
You know that, right? All right.

57:28.111 --> 57:28.945
[door closes]

57:32.615 --> 57:34.284
[indistinct police radio chatter]

58:32.050 --> 58:33.510
[engine starts]

58:39.474 --> 58:40.808
[engine revs]

58:54.989 --> 58:56.616
[siren wailing]

58:59.577 --> 59:01.329
[indistinct police radio chatter]

59:12.090 --> 59:13.716
[indistinct chatter]

59:13.800 --> 59:15.301
[man grunts] Get off me!

59:15.385 --> 59:17.303
[cops cursing indistinctly]

59:17.554 --> 59:19.514
[Pete] Don't make me tell you again!

59:19.597 --> 59:20.598
Spread your legs.

59:21.391 --> 59:23.601
-Now you fucking--
-[cop] You don't move.

59:23.685 --> 59:25.853
-Don't fucking move.
-[Pete] Don't you fucking move.

59:26.271 --> 59:27.981
Now, turn around. Face the wall.

59:28.064 --> 59:29.107
Motherfucker.

59:30.191 --> 59:31.901
Don't you fucking look at me.

59:32.610 --> 59:35.321
Now, let's go, motherfucker.
You know the fucking drill.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.156
Let's start fucking moving.

59:38.866 --> 59:40.952
-You think you're fucked now, huh?
-Get off me!

59:41.035 --> 59:44.622
Move your ass or I'll show you
what fucked is, you motherfucker.

59:44.706 --> 59:46.749
This piece of shit. You feel me?

59:46.833 --> 59:49.711
I'll show you what fucked is.
Get him out of here.

59:54.757 --> 59:57.302
[Latrice's breath trembles]
