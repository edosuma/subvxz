00:00.123 --> 00:01.756
Previously on <i>Royal Pains...</i>

00:01.956 --> 00:03.825
Jeremiah's completely
in love with Divya.

00:03.826 --> 00:05.194
- Hank tell you that?
- No.

00:05.195 --> 00:06.995
Yeah, since last summer.

00:06.996 --> 00:08.263
Head over heels.

00:08.264 --> 00:09.798
Blythe, where'd
you get this bowl?

00:09.799 --> 00:11.466
It's been in the family
for years.

00:11.467 --> 00:12.934
These marks look
authentic to me.

00:12.935 --> 00:14.369
We'll have to get
an appraiser out,

00:14.370 --> 00:17.339
but, in the meantime,
I should stop the truck.

00:17.340 --> 00:19.808
Oh, Paige, how can
I ever repay you?

00:19.809 --> 00:21.443
Why are you worried
about my heart?

00:21.444 --> 00:23.612
With your sarcoidosis,
we need to be extra careful.

00:25.215 --> 00:26.481
- Oww!
- Stop, stop, stop.

00:26.482 --> 00:27.549
Can you give her
something for the pain?

00:27.550 --> 00:29.384
Okay.
Molly...

00:29.385 --> 00:30.819
take one of these hydrocodone.

00:34.257 --> 00:35.457
Dad? Dad?

00:35.458 --> 00:36.958
She said you gave her
a narcotic

00:36.959 --> 00:38.393
that was prescribed to you.

00:38.394 --> 00:40.895
The police want you to submit
to a tox screen,

00:40.896 --> 00:42.297
and I told them
that wouldn't be a problem.

00:42.298 --> 00:43.632
Of course not.

00:43.633 --> 00:44.899
I'm gonna treat your dad
with a course

00:44.900 --> 00:46.335
of high-dose steroids.

00:46.336 --> 00:47.936
Why?
Is he getting worse?

00:47.937 --> 00:49.438
There's been no change.

00:49.439 --> 00:51.206
I told Dr. Oren I want to try
to get him off the ventilator.

00:51.207 --> 00:54.175
- BP's down to 80 over 50!
- What's happening to him?

00:54.176 --> 00:57.312
Running a bolus of two liters,
normal saline wide open.

00:57.313 --> 01:00.315
What did you do to my dad?

01:06.188 --> 01:07.922
Good morning, Hamptons.

01:07.923 --> 01:10.925
Gina Black here, welcoming you
to another <i>Best Day Ever.</i>

01:10.926 --> 01:12.827
With a special election
for village council,

01:12.828 --> 01:14.596
the closing
of Georgica Lanes--

01:14.597 --> 01:16.531
we've got a lot of ground
to cover.

01:16.532 --> 01:18.433
But first, I'm gonna
show you a shortcut

01:18.434 --> 01:20.835
not even the locals know about.

01:20.836 --> 01:23.070
<i>Best Day Ever.</i>

01:25.000 --> 01:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.387 --> 01:38.887
You're up early.

01:38.888 --> 01:40.622
And so are you, little puppy.

01:40.623 --> 01:43.124
Did Evan insist you vote
the second the polls opened?

01:43.125 --> 01:44.959
Actually, I am here to see you.

01:44.960 --> 01:46.328
Great.
You want some breakfast?

01:46.329 --> 01:47.596
Maybe some juice?

01:47.597 --> 01:49.531
"Remember, vote."

01:49.532 --> 01:52.301
How could we forget?

01:52.302 --> 01:54.035
Huh.

01:54.036 --> 01:55.570
So, what's up?

01:55.571 --> 01:57.972
Well, I was dropping off
some labs this morning,

01:57.973 --> 02:00.676
and I heard about
your ordeal last night

02:00.677 --> 02:01.710
at the ICU.

02:01.711 --> 02:03.645
Yeah, it was pretty tough.

02:03.646 --> 02:05.046
Huh.

02:05.047 --> 02:07.982
No, we were battling
Don's blood pressure for hours.

02:07.983 --> 02:09.550
I didn't expect the steroids
to destabilize him

02:09.551 --> 02:10.551
so severely.

02:10.553 --> 02:11.986
It was the right call.

02:11.987 --> 02:14.556
And the injection could
still help revive him.

02:14.557 --> 02:15.990
Yeah.

02:15.991 --> 02:17.726
How is his daughter?

02:17.727 --> 02:18.993
She's relieved
he's doing better,

02:18.994 --> 02:20.429
but she's understandably upset.

02:20.430 --> 02:21.830
I mean, it's been
a rollercoaster.

02:21.831 --> 02:23.064
She hasn't left the ICU.

02:23.065 --> 02:24.933
I only came back
to grab a quick shower.

02:24.934 --> 02:27.068
Why didn't you call me?

02:27.069 --> 02:28.670
The ICU had the situation
pretty well covered.

02:28.671 --> 02:30.672
And one of the nurses has been
texting me with updates.

02:30.673 --> 02:32.273
Can't help thinking
that this would have been

02:32.274 --> 02:34.008
a good time for you to have
some support from someone

02:34.009 --> 02:35.009
who's on your side.

02:35.010 --> 02:37.011
Divya...

02:37.012 --> 02:39.013
you are supporting me.

02:39.014 --> 02:41.450
Because of your help diagnosing
my pain, I feel great.

02:41.451 --> 02:43.585
Well, I want to make sure
that you stay that way.

02:43.586 --> 02:45.253
Don't worry.

02:45.254 --> 02:46.621
But thank you.

02:46.622 --> 02:48.122
Hey, would you mind
covering my patients today

02:48.123 --> 02:49.123
with Jeremiah?

02:49.124 --> 02:51.025
Of course not.

02:51.026 --> 02:52.594
Hey, speaking of Jer--

02:52.595 --> 02:53.795
- I'll be back at the ICU
if you need anything.

02:53.796 --> 02:55.597
I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

02:55.598 --> 02:59.033
I was wondering if you're
aware of Jeremiah's feelings

02:59.034 --> 03:00.736
about anything.

03:03.205 --> 03:04.773
Never mind.
Go, go, go.

03:04.774 --> 03:07.409
No, no, no, no, I think I know
what you're talking about.

03:07.410 --> 03:09.678
Jeremiah is way more
assertive this summer.

03:09.679 --> 03:11.112
It's encouraging, isn't it?

03:11.113 --> 03:12.581
Very.

03:12.582 --> 03:13.849
See you later.

03:22.558 --> 03:24.893
It's finally here.
Election day!

03:24.894 --> 03:26.895
Yep, wow.
You are really excited.

03:26.896 --> 03:28.764
It's an exciting day.

03:28.765 --> 03:30.766
In 11 hours and 52 minutes,

03:30.767 --> 03:32.734
this campaign
is officially over.

03:32.735 --> 03:34.035
What if I win?

03:34.036 --> 03:35.103
Village council
meets once a month.

03:35.104 --> 03:36.304
We'll be fine.

03:36.305 --> 03:37.305
- All right.
- Hello...

03:37.306 --> 03:38.973
Candidate Evan R. Lawson.

03:38.974 --> 03:40.776
Hey. Oh, my God.
I know you--

03:40.777 --> 03:42.477
You're Gina Black
from Channel Six.

03:42.478 --> 03:44.112
Oh, my God, it's
Gina Black from Channel Six.

03:44.113 --> 03:45.714
We watch you every morning.

03:45.715 --> 03:47.348
Oh, thank you so much.

03:47.349 --> 03:49.250
This is so cool.
Are you here for this?

03:49.251 --> 03:50.952
- Of course.
- I'm surprised you're covering

03:50.953 --> 03:52.421
such a small, local race.

03:52.422 --> 03:53.588
And not report
about the new computer

03:53.589 --> 03:55.189
polling stations
in the library?

03:55.190 --> 03:57.426
Don't be crazy.
How about an interview?

03:57.427 --> 03:58.827
With me?

03:58.828 --> 03:59.994
Do it.

03:59.995 --> 04:00.829
- Yeah.
- We'll do it over here.

04:00.830 --> 04:02.531
Great. Okay.

04:02.532 --> 04:04.566
I gotta say, I really
admire how crazy you are

04:04.567 --> 04:05.934
about your job.

04:05.935 --> 04:07.536
Uh, I remember when
you got hypothermia

04:07.537 --> 04:08.603
after that polar bear swim.

04:08.604 --> 04:10.004
That was, like, crazy.

04:10.005 --> 04:11.873
Oh, I chattered
my teeth so hard,

04:11.874 --> 04:13.442
I chipped a tooth.

04:13.443 --> 04:15.343
Or when you broke
Billy Joel's ankle

04:15.344 --> 04:17.612
sliding into him at that
charity softball game.

04:17.613 --> 04:19.781
He is still sore.
Okay, well, enough about me.

04:19.781 --> 04:21.149
Let's talk about you.
Ready?

04:21.149 --> 04:24.853
Sure, yeah.
Wait, wait--

04:24.854 --> 04:27.388
Hi, I'm standing here
with Evan R. Lawson,

04:27.389 --> 04:28.890
who is running
for village council.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.725
That's right,
and his lovely wife, Paige.

04:30.726 --> 04:31.893
Come here.

04:31.894 --> 04:33.361
It's wonderful
to be with you here

04:33.362 --> 04:35.464
- on this historic day.
- Well, thank you.

04:35.465 --> 04:37.933
Mr. Lawson, what is your
reaction to the latest poll?

04:37.934 --> 04:40.335
Well, Gina, it's hard
to put much stock

04:40.336 --> 04:41.803
in a telephone survey.

04:41.804 --> 04:44.272
'Cause I don't even know who
uses land lines anymore.

04:44.273 --> 04:46.374
No, I was referring
to this morning's Twitter poll

04:46.375 --> 04:49.744
showing you with a narrow lead
over Edwina Bowman.

04:49.745 --> 04:51.813
Uh...

04:51.814 --> 04:53.247
Oh, that.
Yes, that one.

04:53.248 --> 04:55.584
That-- I feel differently
about that poll.

04:55.585 --> 04:57.385
By all indications,
this will be

04:57.386 --> 05:00.188
the closest council race
in a generation.

05:00.189 --> 05:02.524
The battle of old versus new.

05:02.525 --> 05:04.325
Telephone versus Twitter.

05:04.326 --> 05:07.095
Social set
versus social network.

05:07.096 --> 05:08.563
Okay, let's cut.

05:08.564 --> 05:09.664
- Are you okay?
- Ohh.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.333
My jaw is sore
and a little stiff.

05:12.334 --> 05:15.169
It's probably just
all the talking this morning.

05:15.170 --> 05:17.939
Well, feel free
to call this number

05:17.940 --> 05:19.407
if it feels any worse, okay?

05:19.408 --> 05:21.843
"Hankmed."
I will, thanks.

05:21.844 --> 05:23.077
All right, cool
nice to meet you.

05:23.078 --> 05:25.914
You too.

05:25.915 --> 05:27.816
Excuse me, sir.
Can I talk to you?

05:27.817 --> 05:29.818
Good morning.

05:29.819 --> 05:32.854
Good morning to you,
Mr. Lawson. Paige.

05:32.855 --> 05:34.656
So you're bussing people in.

05:34.657 --> 05:36.725
Uh, I guess you saw
the latest Twitter poll.

05:36.726 --> 05:38.827
Twitter doesn't scare me.

05:38.828 --> 05:40.695
These people work
for me and my neighbors.

05:40.696 --> 05:43.765
It is the law to allow
employees time off to vote.

05:43.766 --> 05:45.400
I like to go the extra mile.

05:45.401 --> 05:47.168
Oh! Well, why stop there?

05:47.169 --> 05:51.039
Why not just bus in the entire
Southampton social register?

05:51.040 --> 05:52.674
Mr. Lawson,

05:52.675 --> 05:54.743
you've given me
an excellent idea.

06:12.428 --> 06:14.696
Hey, Molly.
Uh...

06:14.697 --> 06:17.265
I just spoke
with Dr. Oren.

06:17.266 --> 06:18.800
We'll get your dad's
tests back soon,

06:18.801 --> 06:20.435
and we'll know how the new
antibiotics are working.

06:20.436 --> 06:22.437
- Otherwise, I can try to--
- Haven't you done enough?

06:25.207 --> 06:27.442
- Molly--
- I trusted you!

06:27.443 --> 06:29.778
I'm sorry, look,
I really believed those---

06:29.779 --> 06:31.913
That shot that you gave my dad
almost killed him!

06:31.914 --> 06:33.648
And he's still in a coma!

06:33.649 --> 06:35.817
Look, I know it's upsetting
to see your dad like that--

06:35.818 --> 06:37.652
- Get off me!
- Agh!

06:40.690 --> 06:44.125
Just... stay away from me.

06:44.126 --> 06:45.159
Okay?

06:45.160 --> 06:47.495
And stay away from my dad.

06:56.973 --> 06:59.447
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

07:04.223 --> 07:07.592
Even though I'll be
moving out soon,

07:07.593 --> 07:10.962
I'm glad that we've become
better friends,

07:10.963 --> 07:13.231
because your friendship

07:13.232 --> 07:14.766
is very important to me.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.167
Mm, yes.

07:16.168 --> 07:18.737
And you always said your stay
would be temporary

07:18.738 --> 07:22.173
because of the mold.

07:22.174 --> 07:23.642
Is that our patient?

07:23.643 --> 07:26.310
Unless you know someone else
who drives a water car

07:26.311 --> 07:28.813
and is meeting us at Tower 7.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.148
Are you excited to meet her?

07:30.149 --> 07:31.783
She's fearless.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.885
I loved it when she did
the polar bear swim.

07:40.159 --> 07:42.493
Hankmed?

07:42.494 --> 07:44.495
Hi. I'm Divya Kadare,

07:44.496 --> 07:45.964
and this is
Dr. Jeremiah Sacani.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.231
How nice to meet you.

07:47.232 --> 07:49.333
You too.
My jaw is locked.

07:49.334 --> 07:52.336
Um, you have trismas,
commonly known as lockjaw.

07:52.337 --> 07:54.639
- Please fix it.
- Of course, of course.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.275
I have to tell you, I'm a fan.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.778
Every time I think of that
celebrity softball game,

07:59.779 --> 08:01.312
I cry.

08:01.313 --> 08:03.447
Because Billy Joel got
his ankle bent the wrong way?

08:03.448 --> 08:05.349
Uh, no.

08:05.350 --> 08:06.551
Because of all
the money you raised

08:06.552 --> 08:07.552
for the homeless families.

08:07.553 --> 08:08.987
Oh. Thank you.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.355
Your temperature is normal,

08:11.356 --> 08:14.659
which means the cause
is unlikely to be infection.

08:14.660 --> 08:15.860
Have you been sick lately?

08:15.861 --> 08:17.162
Not really.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.897
I had a sore throat
about a week ago.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.865
Well, we should rule out
tetanus, TMJ,

08:20.866 --> 08:22.500
and any recent oral surgeries.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.704
I agree, but I think
I may know the cause.

08:25.705 --> 08:29.373
You did a story on cosmetic
fillers last Tuesday,

08:29.374 --> 08:30.742
and you had a nerve block.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.044
But then I stopped
and didn't get the Juvederm.

08:33.044 --> 08:34.477
Oh, yes, which surprised me

08:34.479 --> 08:36.581
because you're usually
so daring.

08:36.582 --> 08:38.116
I'm in television.

08:38.116 --> 08:40.085
<i>Not</i> getting a cosmetic filler
is daring.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.553
But if there had been
an inaccurate positioning

08:42.554 --> 08:44.222
of the needle during
the nerve block,

08:44.222 --> 08:46.224
then the result could be
lockjaw.

08:46.225 --> 08:47.658
We could get--

08:47.659 --> 08:50.361
You should see a maxillofacial
surgeon immediately.

08:50.362 --> 08:51.629
That sounds serious.

08:51.630 --> 08:54.398
I'm not sure we're
quite there yet.

08:54.399 --> 08:55.533
Would you excuse us a moment?

08:55.534 --> 08:58.536
Sure.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.674
Your recommendation feels
a bit extreme,

09:03.675 --> 09:04.776
don't you think?

09:04.777 --> 09:08.046
I don't want to miss anything.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.749
We all missed what was
going on with Hank.

09:10.750 --> 09:12.283
You don't need
to second-guess yourself

09:12.284 --> 09:14.518
and bring in a surgeon.

09:14.519 --> 09:16.287
How about we start
a little smaller?

09:16.288 --> 09:18.289
Muscle relaxants
and a heating pad?

09:18.290 --> 09:19.791
Mm-hmm,
and if that doesn't work,

09:19.792 --> 09:22.593
we can move on
to something else.

09:22.594 --> 09:24.796
We can take turns
following up on her,

09:24.797 --> 09:27.331
if you'd like.

09:27.332 --> 09:29.000
I was being irrational.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.802
Thank you for--
for understanding.

09:30.803 --> 09:34.773
That's what friends are for.

09:34.774 --> 09:38.810
Okay, Gina, let's go get
that jaw unlocked.

09:38.811 --> 09:41.146
Check, check.

09:41.147 --> 09:42.981
Ladies and gentlemen,
hi, there.

09:42.982 --> 09:44.315
Just let me get your attention
for one second.

09:44.316 --> 09:46.317
Hi. My name's Evan R. Lawson.

09:46.318 --> 09:48.119
And I am your candidate
for village council.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.388
That's right,
election is today,

09:50.389 --> 09:52.390
so get out there and vote--
Yes, vote!

09:52.391 --> 09:53.758
Don't play possum.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.226
Vote for Lawson.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.661
You, ma'am-- hi.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.930
Hi, with the dog
in the stroller.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.765
Oh, my God, look at that face.
It's so cute.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.267
Your dog is also adorable.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.435
Will you vote for me?
Promise me you'll vote for me.

10:04.436 --> 10:05.503
Promise me!

10:05.504 --> 10:06.771
It's a yes!
That's great!

10:06.772 --> 10:08.072
That's what I'm talking about.

10:08.073 --> 10:10.842
Lawson! Lawson!
All right, um, hi.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.610
Please vote for me.

10:12.611 --> 10:14.012
The election's today, okay?

10:14.013 --> 10:15.947
Make a difference.
Be an American.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.148
Know what I'm talking about?

10:17.149 --> 10:19.050
Just go and vote,
and, uh--

10:40.639 --> 10:41.840
Hey.

10:41.841 --> 10:42.941
You, uh, you wanted to see me?

10:42.942 --> 10:44.508
Yeah, I just wanted
to talk to you.

10:44.509 --> 10:46.544
I swear, if you and Dr. Oren
have come to blows--

10:46.545 --> 10:48.079
- Uh, no, it was--
- Okay, then don't tell me.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.547
I don't want to know.

10:49.548 --> 10:50.882
- But it had nothing to--
- No, I'm serious.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.717
You've generated enough
paperwork for me this week.

10:52.718 --> 10:53.818
- Sit down.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.119
All right.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.055
Oh, so sweet of you
to go through my stuff,

10:57.056 --> 10:58.957
by the way.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.125
You know...

11:01.126 --> 11:02.793
before I met you,

11:02.794 --> 11:05.730
I heard all these amazing things
about you.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.531
And I just kept thinking
you had to be

11:07.532 --> 11:09.834
too good to be true.

11:09.835 --> 11:12.170
Now we have a patient in a coma

11:12.171 --> 11:13.905
and your positive
tox screen results,

11:13.906 --> 11:19.010
and I can't help but think
maybe I was right.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.645
Look, I know that the facts--

11:21.646 --> 11:23.147
Oh, morning, Shelby.
Sorry I'm late.

11:23.148 --> 11:26.050
My flight was delayed.

11:26.051 --> 11:27.718
You must be Dr. Lawson.

11:27.719 --> 11:29.053
Yes, and you are?

11:29.054 --> 11:30.554
Bobby Moxley.
Nice to meet you.

11:30.555 --> 11:34.792
Bobby's symphony's
Associate General Counsel.

11:34.793 --> 11:36.460
Ah.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.662
So is he here for me
or for you?

11:38.663 --> 11:39.964
For us.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.299
Hankmed is part of symphony,

11:41.300 --> 11:42.934
so we're all in this together.

11:42.935 --> 11:44.536
Aren't we?

11:47.506 --> 11:49.941
I'm live with Councilwoman
Blythe Ballard,

11:49.942 --> 11:53.278
speaking today on behalf
of Candidate Edwina Bowman.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.779
Mr. Lawson, would you care
to join us?

11:54.780 --> 11:57.982
Sure, yeah.
Okay.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.417
Uh, one question, though.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.751
Why is Blythe speaking
on behalf of Edwina?

12:00.752 --> 12:02.086
What, are you hiding her
somewhere?

12:02.087 --> 12:04.255
Actually, Edwina is
at her husband's side.

12:04.256 --> 12:06.925
He's having emergency surgery
related to the wound

12:06.926 --> 12:09.560
he received on his third tour
of duty in Vietnam.

12:09.561 --> 12:11.262
Oh, go ahead.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.931
Make your little jokes.

12:12.932 --> 12:15.266
You know, he was spat on
when he returned home,

12:15.267 --> 12:17.768
and now, in a way,
he has been again.

12:17.769 --> 12:20.038
Mr. Lawson?

12:20.039 --> 12:21.772
I love our troops,

12:21.773 --> 12:23.408
and I have no idea
what this has to do

12:23.409 --> 12:25.143
with the election.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.478
Yes, let's talk
about the election.

12:27.479 --> 12:28.846
Mr. Lawson,
you and I both know

12:28.847 --> 12:31.115
you entered this race
entirely out of self-interest.

12:31.116 --> 12:32.951
All you really want
is a dismissal

12:32.952 --> 12:35.253
of the cease-and-desist order
against your business.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.821
- Right, now, it-- it--
- Of course, we'd all love it

12:36.822 --> 12:38.189
if government could take care

12:38.190 --> 12:39.424
of our individual problems,

12:39.425 --> 12:40.724
but government isn't
about what's best

12:40.725 --> 12:42.060
for the individual.

12:42.061 --> 12:43.828
It's about what's best
for the community.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.063
Okay, I know that, Blythe,
and thank you for--

12:45.064 --> 12:47.031
- How long have you lived
in this one?

12:47.032 --> 12:49.000
Uh, a couple of years,
but my wife and I have become--

12:49.001 --> 12:50.501
Oh, that's right.

12:50.502 --> 12:52.003
You did marry into the family
of Senator Collins.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.604
Okay, can I finish
one sentence, please?

12:53.605 --> 12:56.941
Yes, yes, I may have entered
this race

12:56.942 --> 12:58.176
for personal reasons,

12:58.177 --> 13:00.011
but I stayed in it
because I care

13:00.012 --> 13:01.279
about this community.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.780
All you care about, Blythe,

13:02.781 --> 13:04.782
is power and obedience.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.917
People are scared of you.
Do you know that?

13:06.918 --> 13:08.919
Of course you know it.
You love it.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.754
You-- you've terrorized
village hall.

13:10.755 --> 13:13.424
You're like a-- you're like
a dog-free Cruella De Vil.

13:13.425 --> 13:14.792
- Evan.
- You know what?

13:14.793 --> 13:16.094
It makes perfect sense
that your husband left you

13:16.095 --> 13:18.162
because--

13:18.163 --> 13:19.485
that--

13:22.034 --> 13:23.846
'cause--

13:27.172 --> 13:29.107
Back to you in the studio, Jim.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.742
So you got a prescription
for hydrocodone

13:31.743 --> 13:32.810
from Dr. Sacani.

13:32.811 --> 13:34.045
Yes.

13:34.046 --> 13:35.213
Then you used that up,

13:35.214 --> 13:38.049
and you went to the Bellport
Pain Clinic.

13:38.050 --> 13:39.950
Look, I wasn't
"doctor shopping",

13:39.951 --> 13:41.352
if that's what you're implying.

13:41.353 --> 13:42.686
No, I don't mean to be
implying anything.

13:42.687 --> 13:43.988
I was treating legitimate pain

13:43.989 --> 13:45.756
- with a legitimate prescription.
- I understand.

13:45.757 --> 13:47.425
I'm just trying
to get the facts straight.

13:47.426 --> 13:49.227
- Okay.
- Did either doctor

13:49.228 --> 13:50.361
ever warn you
about the side effects

13:50.362 --> 13:52.163
of hydrocodone?

13:52.164 --> 13:53.498
No, they didn't need to.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.133
See, being a physician myself,

13:55.134 --> 13:56.401
I was already aware of them.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.169
Look, since we're all
in this together,

13:58.170 --> 13:59.404
let's not waste our time.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.305
Okay, you want to know
if I was ever impaired

14:01.306 --> 14:03.841
while treating patients.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.843
Were you?

14:05.844 --> 14:08.246
Never.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.580
I did not put patients at risk,

14:09.581 --> 14:10.814
and I'm not a drug addict.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.983
I had undiagnosed
radicular pain

14:12.984 --> 14:15.586
for which I took
a prescribed medication

14:15.587 --> 14:16.787
that I no longer need.

14:18.257 --> 14:19.857
Uh, if you'll excuse me,

14:19.858 --> 14:21.959
I'm needed in the ICU.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.728
We'll have to continue
this conversation later, okay?

14:31.503 --> 14:32.670
What's happening?
What is he doing?

14:32.671 --> 14:33.871
He's trying
to pull his tube out.

14:33.872 --> 14:35.206
We need to sedate him.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.340
Uh, wait, wait, wait.
Don?

14:36.341 --> 14:37.775
- 100 milligrams diprivan.
- Don.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.877
Don!

14:39.878 --> 14:41.212
It's okay.
It's okay.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.580
You just need to calm down.

14:44.249 --> 14:46.284
You had a heart problem.

14:46.285 --> 14:47.785
Remember?
We got stuck in the sand.

14:47.786 --> 14:48.886
But Molly's safe.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.588
See?

14:50.589 --> 14:52.123
See, she's right here.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.092
She's okay.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.160
That's it.

14:56.161 --> 14:57.428
And you're gonna be okay too.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.464
You are.

14:59.465 --> 15:01.199
So just--

15:01.200 --> 15:04.535
just let Dr. Oren
do his work.

15:12.043 --> 15:13.978
It's okay.

15:20.951 --> 15:22.251
Good.

15:22.252 --> 15:25.721
All right, suctioning the tube.

15:25.722 --> 15:28.218
Good.

15:31.027 --> 15:33.428
Okay, good.

15:33.429 --> 15:35.572
That's it.

15:39.535 --> 15:42.415
Okay, deflating the balloon.

15:43.306 --> 15:46.308
And removing the tube.

15:55.952 --> 15:58.785
There we go.

16:00.991 --> 16:02.686
Take a deep breath.

16:04.027 --> 16:05.595
And again.

16:06.496 --> 16:07.963
Any stridor?

16:07.964 --> 16:09.698
No.

16:09.699 --> 16:12.935
Okay, Don, you're gonna be
a little hoarse.

16:15.038 --> 16:17.506
Better hoarse than dead.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.176
Molly, you okay?

16:21.177 --> 16:23.279
Don't worry about me, dad.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.214
- But your leg--
- It's fine.

16:25.215 --> 16:28.250
It's fine.

16:28.251 --> 16:29.251
I don't remember anything

16:29.252 --> 16:30.452
once we went off the road.

16:30.453 --> 16:33.555
That's not uncommon.

16:33.556 --> 16:35.457
Let's let him rest.

16:42.865 --> 16:44.345
Thank you.

16:46.702 --> 16:48.280
Ms. Ballard?

16:49.772 --> 16:51.974
Uh, I would like
to apologize to you.

16:51.975 --> 16:55.177
But first, I should apologize.

16:55.178 --> 16:57.079
Blythe, I am so sorry.

16:57.080 --> 16:58.981
I never would have said anything
to my husband

16:58.982 --> 17:00.382
if I thought he'd repeat it.

17:00.383 --> 17:03.252
I assure you I was not trying

17:03.253 --> 17:05.186
to gossip about you,

17:05.188 --> 17:07.189
and when I did, I--

17:07.190 --> 17:09.723
I feel awful
about what's happened.

17:09.724 --> 17:11.226
Thank you, dear.

17:11.227 --> 17:12.694
And after everything
you've done for me,

17:12.694 --> 17:15.164
I could never be truly angry.

17:15.165 --> 17:17.866
You were saying,
Mr. Lawson?

17:17.867 --> 17:20.169
The perfect words
to express how--

17:20.170 --> 17:23.405
how truly sorry I am
probably don't exist,

17:23.406 --> 17:24.705
so I'll just tell you
what I know,

17:24.707 --> 17:26.575
which is that I felt cornered,

17:26.576 --> 17:28.010
and I lashed out,

17:28.011 --> 17:30.245
which is not an--
There's no excuses--

17:30.246 --> 17:32.848
- Evan.

17:32.849 --> 17:35.084
I'm really sorry.

17:35.085 --> 17:36.585
Once again, Mr. Lawson,

17:36.586 --> 17:39.221
you show what a neophyte
you are.

17:39.222 --> 17:41.728
God help us all
if you are elected.

17:42.592 --> 17:45.027
You don't apologize for hitting
below the belt.

17:45.028 --> 17:47.596
That's how politics works,
my dear boy.

17:47.597 --> 17:50.299
You punch me,
I punch you-- but harder.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.667
So...

17:52.668 --> 17:54.103
what are you gonna do?

17:54.104 --> 17:56.335
I've already done it.

18:07.550 --> 18:09.751
Unless village council
intervenes...

18:09.752 --> 18:11.420
historic Georgica Lanes

18:11.421 --> 18:13.655
is scheduled to close
at the end of the month,

18:13.656 --> 18:15.657
so if you're looking
to bowl a few frames,

18:15.658 --> 18:18.160
you better strike
while the iron is hot.

18:22.965 --> 18:24.099
Ugh.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.534
Let's do it again.

18:25.535 --> 18:26.568
Divya, hi.

18:26.569 --> 18:27.736
Hi. I just wanted

18:27.737 --> 18:29.004
to check up on you in person.

18:29.005 --> 18:30.539
Oh, I'm fine.

18:30.540 --> 18:31.840
I'm glad to see
that your lockjaw is resolved.

18:31.841 --> 18:32.841
Yeah.

18:32.842 --> 18:33.842
But on the phone

18:33.843 --> 18:35.344
and just now, actually,

18:35.345 --> 18:36.611
it sounded like you were
having trouble

18:36.612 --> 18:37.779
catching your breath.

18:37.780 --> 18:38.947
How long have you been bowling?

18:38.948 --> 18:40.982
This is my first time.

18:40.983 --> 18:43.952
Oh.
But I meant today.

18:43.953 --> 18:45.421
Oh, not that long.

18:49.259 --> 18:51.960
Okay, this is my 37th take.

18:51.961 --> 18:52.961
I guess I thought
getting a strike

18:52.962 --> 18:54.229
would be a lot easier.

18:54.230 --> 18:55.431
Would you let me
check your lungs?

18:55.432 --> 18:56.998
Sure.

18:56.999 --> 19:00.202
Sit down.
And please turn around.

19:04.107 --> 19:06.341
A deep breath in.

19:06.342 --> 19:07.342
Out.

19:07.343 --> 19:09.044
And again.

19:09.045 --> 19:10.045
In.

19:10.046 --> 19:12.548
Out.

19:12.549 --> 19:15.551
No rales or consolidation.

19:15.552 --> 19:16.552
Your lungs are clear.

19:16.553 --> 19:18.653
Oh.

19:18.654 --> 19:21.223
I have to ask you.

19:21.224 --> 19:23.692
How is it that you
have never bowled before?

19:23.693 --> 19:25.360
Oh, it's crazy, I know.

19:25.361 --> 19:27.662
I grew up sheltered.

19:27.663 --> 19:28.964
Home-schooled.

19:28.965 --> 19:30.799
And in the middle of nowhere.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.601
My hippy parents didn't even
have a TV.

19:32.602 --> 19:33.969
They said it would get
in the way

19:33.970 --> 19:35.571
of more serious endeavors.

19:35.572 --> 19:36.838
Aha.

19:36.839 --> 19:38.073
But I think that everything

19:38.074 --> 19:39.441
is worth exploring.

19:39.442 --> 19:41.743
And I want to experience
everything

19:41.744 --> 19:43.912
my new hometown has to offer.

19:43.913 --> 19:45.314
This job lets me do that.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.849
Which brings me
back to bowling.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.851
I would like to do
an EKG first.

19:49.852 --> 19:52.121
Whoa, you think I'm gonna have
a heart attack?

19:52.122 --> 19:55.357
In a young, healthy woman,
very unlikely.

19:55.358 --> 19:57.259
But because of the shortness
of breath

19:57.260 --> 19:58.293
and your recent jaw pain,

19:58.294 --> 20:00.929
I just want to make sure.

20:00.930 --> 20:02.400
Okay.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.470
Dr. Lawson!

20:08.471 --> 20:09.505
Wait up.

20:09.506 --> 20:10.839
Is everything okay?

20:10.840 --> 20:13.975
Um, yeah, my dad's fine.

20:15.378 --> 20:18.117
I just wanted to say thank you.

20:19.315 --> 20:21.227
And I'm sorry.

20:23.686 --> 20:26.888
Apology accepted.
And you don't have to thank me.

20:26.889 --> 20:27.922
I was just doing my job.

20:27.923 --> 20:29.525
You saved my life.

20:29.526 --> 20:32.227
You saved my dad's life.

20:32.228 --> 20:34.062
And I hit you.

20:34.063 --> 20:35.464
Yeah, well, you were upset.

20:35.465 --> 20:36.865
I was-- I don't--
I don't know.

20:36.866 --> 20:39.768
Everything-- everything was just
so overwhelming.

20:39.769 --> 20:40.835
Yeah, well, look.

20:40.836 --> 20:42.471
It was an overwhelming
situation.

20:42.472 --> 20:46.007
One that I created.

20:46.008 --> 20:48.009
I feel like this is
all my fault.

20:48.010 --> 20:49.278
No.

20:49.279 --> 20:50.512
It's not.

20:50.513 --> 20:52.614
Your dad has
a medical condition.

20:52.615 --> 20:54.082
That's no one's fault.

20:54.083 --> 20:56.618
Sarcoidosis.

20:56.619 --> 20:58.720
I know.
He told me.

20:58.721 --> 21:00.922
Because you told him to.

21:00.923 --> 21:04.259
So thanks for that too,
Dr. Lawson.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.494
Hank.

21:05.495 --> 21:08.129
Hank.

21:08.130 --> 21:09.665
You are exhausted.

21:09.666 --> 21:11.667
Why don't you get some rest?

21:11.668 --> 21:13.835
I will.

21:13.836 --> 21:16.004
See you later, Hank.

21:16.005 --> 21:19.007
See you later, Molly.

21:29.419 --> 21:30.485
Dr. Sacani.

21:30.486 --> 21:31.620
Do you mind if I join you?

21:31.621 --> 21:32.987
Not at all.

21:32.988 --> 21:34.232
Great.

21:35.325 --> 21:36.523
Oh.

21:43.366 --> 21:44.899
My amino modulators.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.134
They help space out
my episodes.

21:46.135 --> 21:47.402
I always feel better
when I take them

21:47.403 --> 21:48.470
with a little bit of food.

21:48.471 --> 21:50.445
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.943
So...

21:54.944 --> 21:57.212
I don't know
if you've spoken with Hank,

21:57.213 --> 22:00.282
but his tox screen has created
a bit of a situation.

22:00.283 --> 22:01.783
What kind of a situation?

22:01.784 --> 22:05.220
Honestly, a potentially
legal situation.

22:05.221 --> 22:07.021
But his patient has recovered.

22:07.022 --> 22:08.257
He's out of his coma.

22:08.258 --> 22:10.459
Mm-hmm, I know,
and that's good news

22:10.460 --> 22:11.793
for everybody.

22:11.794 --> 22:13.362
But unfortunately,
we can't ignore

22:13.363 --> 22:15.864
the events leading
up to Don's accident,

22:15.865 --> 22:17.633
which is why I spoke
with Hank this morning.

22:17.634 --> 22:19.601
And he understands
that we'll be speaking

22:19.602 --> 22:22.203
with everybody involved.

22:22.204 --> 22:26.207
Um, what would you like
to know?

22:26.208 --> 22:29.010
Well, I'm just curious.

22:29.011 --> 22:30.779
When Hank first came to you,

22:30.780 --> 22:32.547
was it for help
or for medication?

22:32.548 --> 22:33.882
He asked for medication.

22:33.883 --> 22:34.949
Right, he mentioned
that you wrote him

22:34.950 --> 22:36.117
a prescription for hydrocodone.

22:36.118 --> 22:37.519
I did.

22:37.520 --> 22:40.722
Did that put you
in an awkward situation?

22:40.723 --> 22:42.023
Uh, what do you mean?

22:42.024 --> 22:43.592
Well, I just know
that if my boss

22:43.593 --> 22:44.826
came asking me for something,
I might feel

22:44.827 --> 22:46.295
a sense of obligation.

22:46.296 --> 22:47.962
Uh, well, my obligation
was to provide him

22:47.963 --> 22:49.731
with what I felt
was medically appropriate.

22:49.732 --> 22:51.500
Mm-hmm, that makes sense.

22:51.501 --> 22:53.034
And then when you stopped
providing it,

22:53.035 --> 22:54.670
he went to a pain clinic.

22:54.671 --> 22:56.004
He did.

22:56.005 --> 22:57.673
Why do you think
he came to you first?

22:57.674 --> 22:59.341
Why are you asking me
these questions?

22:59.342 --> 23:01.643
Jeremiah, there may be lawyers

23:01.644 --> 23:03.278
asking you these questions,

23:03.279 --> 23:05.747
and it's just very important
that you tell the truth.

23:05.748 --> 23:07.749
Why wouldn't I tell the truth?

23:07.750 --> 23:10.051
Maybe to protect Hank?

23:10.052 --> 23:11.286
He does seem to have
quite a bit of influence

23:11.287 --> 23:14.989
over you.

23:14.990 --> 23:18.694
A-are you suggesting
that Hank came to me

23:18.695 --> 23:20.895
not because of my
medical expertise,

23:20.896 --> 23:23.665
but because I wouldn't say no?

23:23.666 --> 23:25.691
Do you think that?

23:38.378 --> 23:40.078
Hank?

23:40.079 --> 23:41.946
Uh, hello?
Anyone here?

23:41.947 --> 23:43.515
Hello?

23:43.516 --> 23:45.417
Please come in.

23:45.418 --> 23:46.585
I'm sorry to bother you.

23:46.586 --> 23:47.952
I'm just--
I'm looking for Hank.

23:47.953 --> 23:49.187
Is he around?

23:49.188 --> 23:50.722
Actually, he's not here
at the moment.

23:50.723 --> 23:52.223
Is there anything I can do
for you?

23:52.224 --> 23:53.458
We haven't met.

23:53.459 --> 23:55.093
I'm Divya,
Hank's Physician Assistant.

23:55.094 --> 23:56.928
Hi. I'm Molly.

23:56.929 --> 23:58.497
And I'm not here
for anything medical.

23:58.498 --> 24:02.000
I just wanted
to apologize to him.

24:02.001 --> 24:03.742
Apologize?

24:05.204 --> 24:07.223
I hit him.

24:09.642 --> 24:11.910
He saved my life.

24:11.911 --> 24:13.945
He saved my dad's life.

24:13.946 --> 24:15.213
And I hit him.

24:15.214 --> 24:18.817
And plus, I blamed him,
when the truth is,

24:18.818 --> 24:21.915
none of this would've happened
if it weren't for me.

24:22.688 --> 24:24.989
Molly...

24:24.990 --> 24:27.759
I'm sorry you're so upset.

24:27.760 --> 24:28.760
You feel okay?

24:28.761 --> 24:30.629
You look exhausted.

24:30.630 --> 24:32.163
Yeah, yeah.

24:32.164 --> 24:35.166
I just haven't slept in days.

24:40.372 --> 24:43.041
All right, guys,
polls close in three hours.

24:43.042 --> 24:44.476
That means we still have time

24:44.477 --> 24:46.678
to convince the people
of Southampton to vote.

24:46.679 --> 24:49.748
For me, of course.
For me.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.817
We should be getting
another election update soon.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.217
Wanna watch?
Let's watch.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.419
Who is running today for a seat

24:54.420 --> 24:55.554
on the village council.

24:55.555 --> 24:56.922
Divya, hello.

24:56.923 --> 24:58.323
Um, I came to the fire station.

24:58.324 --> 25:00.325
I thought you might still be
checking up on Gina.

25:00.326 --> 25:03.328
Um, ahem, I was hoping
I could speak with you about--

25:06.231 --> 25:07.566
Actually, never mind.

25:07.567 --> 25:08.667
No need to call me back.

25:08.668 --> 25:10.335
I'll catch up with you later.

25:10.336 --> 25:12.838
Gina-- oh, Gina Black,
Channel Six news.

25:12.839 --> 25:15.740
How come you're wearing
a choir robe to vote today?

25:15.741 --> 25:17.843
We all came from the middle
of choir practice.

25:17.844 --> 25:19.678
And you're racing
out to vote because?

25:19.679 --> 25:22.681
Because Evan R. Lawson
launched a character attack

25:22.682 --> 25:24.983
on Blythe Ballard,
and he's a fraud.

25:24.984 --> 25:26.317
What makes you think
he's a fraud?

25:26.318 --> 25:27.953
He's been gallivanting
around town

25:27.954 --> 25:29.688
portraying himself
as a family man,

25:29.689 --> 25:31.189
when his marriage
isn't even real.

25:31.190 --> 25:32.491
How's that?

25:32.492 --> 25:34.926
I heard he used
an online minister.

25:34.927 --> 25:36.528
And those online guys
aren't even legal

25:36.529 --> 25:37.829
in Suffolk County.

25:37.830 --> 25:40.198
That's true.
We did a story about that.

25:40.199 --> 25:41.800
If he can't get
his own wedding right,

25:41.801 --> 25:43.568
he shouldn't even be allowed
to run for town council.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.804
Is that really true
about online ministers?

25:45.805 --> 25:47.138
I don't know.
I'm looking it up.

25:47.139 --> 25:48.139
That can't be.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.141
It can't be.

25:50.142 --> 25:51.142
It is.

25:51.143 --> 25:54.145
So we're not married.

25:54.146 --> 25:56.481
Uh, no,
of course we're married.

25:56.482 --> 25:58.550
We're just-- it's--
not technically.

25:58.551 --> 25:59.818
So technically,
we're not married.

25:59.819 --> 26:01.019
Look, it's a clerical error,
all right?

26:01.020 --> 26:02.353
We'll just fix it later.

26:02.354 --> 26:03.989
Okay?

26:03.990 --> 26:05.991
But this one's getting...

26:05.992 --> 26:07.325
We're really not married?

26:07.326 --> 26:08.727
...because of all
the mudslinging.

26:08.728 --> 26:11.462
And that's why I voted
for Evan R. Lawson.

26:11.463 --> 26:12.463
What?

26:12.464 --> 26:13.965
I voted for Edwina Bowman.

26:13.966 --> 26:15.466
Well, that's crazy talk.

26:15.467 --> 26:16.601
Why is that crazy?

26:16.602 --> 26:18.904
Oh, my God.

26:18.905 --> 26:21.472
What is wrong with you?

26:21.473 --> 26:24.475
Gina Black, reporting live
from Main Street.

26:26.512 --> 26:29.014
Gina, you have
hemifacial discoloration.

26:29.015 --> 26:30.481
Um, half your face is blue.

26:30.482 --> 26:31.482
Are you in pain?

26:31.483 --> 26:32.817
A lot.

26:32.818 --> 26:35.319
Oh, my neck is killing me.

26:35.320 --> 26:37.689
Oh, I was trying
to finish my story.

26:39.224 --> 26:40.559
This palpable cord in your neck

26:40.560 --> 26:41.693
is your internal jugular vein.

26:41.694 --> 26:42.694
It's become blocked.

26:42.695 --> 26:43.929
What's wrong with me?

26:43.930 --> 26:45.163
Together with your sore throat

26:45.164 --> 26:47.498
and the trismus,
it suggests Lemierre's Syndrome.

26:47.499 --> 26:48.633
It's a bacterial infection.

26:48.634 --> 26:49.834
It's treatable
with antibiotics,

26:49.835 --> 26:52.604
but we have to get you
to a hospital.

26:56.676 --> 26:59.277
Oh, hey.
How's Don?

26:59.278 --> 27:00.579
Much better.

27:00.580 --> 27:01.680
That's good to hear.

27:01.681 --> 27:04.415
So Molly stopped by.

27:04.416 --> 27:05.483
Really?

27:05.484 --> 27:07.214
Yeah.

27:08.688 --> 27:10.521
I have to tell you,
I am surprised

27:10.522 --> 27:11.790
that you had such trouble
with her.

27:11.791 --> 27:13.091
How so?

27:13.092 --> 27:15.860
Molly is a sweetheart,

27:15.861 --> 27:17.929
and a very grateful one
at that.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.764
Well, maybe today,
but she's usually the epitome

27:19.765 --> 27:20.966
of an angry teenager.

27:20.967 --> 27:22.601
She came to apologize.

27:22.602 --> 27:25.436
She said she knows
that she was blaming you

27:25.437 --> 27:26.871
because she didn't want
to admit

27:26.872 --> 27:27.973
she blamed herself,

27:27.974 --> 27:29.908
and that you saved her life

27:29.909 --> 27:32.376
and her father's life.

27:32.377 --> 27:35.046
She said that same thing to me
a couple hours ago.

27:35.047 --> 27:36.915
I mean, that exact same thing.

27:36.916 --> 27:38.316
That's odd.

27:38.317 --> 27:39.985
She's been acting strange
all day.

27:39.986 --> 27:42.153
I want to talk to her.

27:42.154 --> 27:44.723
Well, you don't have to go
very far.

27:44.724 --> 27:45.957
She's still here.

27:45.958 --> 27:46.891
She wanted to wait for you.

27:46.892 --> 27:48.521
Oh.

27:50.763 --> 27:52.664
She was so exhausted.

27:52.665 --> 27:54.465
Right.

27:54.466 --> 27:56.434
Molly?

27:56.435 --> 27:57.836
Hey, Hank.

27:57.837 --> 27:59.237
Hi.

27:59.238 --> 28:00.238
Would you sit up?

28:00.239 --> 28:01.606
Yeah.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.009
I just want to take
a quick look at you.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.344
Would you follow my finger
with your eyes?

28:06.345 --> 28:07.445
All right.

28:07.446 --> 28:09.948
Left, right.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.683
Up, down.

28:11.684 --> 28:13.384
Okay, good.

28:13.385 --> 28:16.387
Um, would you just look
straight ahead for me?

28:19.992 --> 28:22.260
Okay, now I want you
to count backwards from 100

28:22.261 --> 28:24.262
by sevens.

28:24.263 --> 28:25.563
Seriously?

28:25.564 --> 28:27.465
Seriously.

28:27.466 --> 28:31.335
Uh, 100...

28:31.336 --> 28:34.005
93... mm...

28:34.006 --> 28:35.373
You're having trouble
concentrating.

28:35.374 --> 28:37.976
Have you had any drugs
or alcohol?

28:37.977 --> 28:40.478
No, no, of course not.

28:40.479 --> 28:42.847
Can you just let me sleep?

28:42.848 --> 28:44.443
Mmph.

28:47.386 --> 28:48.820
We need to get a CT.

28:48.821 --> 28:51.122
The short-term memory loss,
the poor concentration,

28:51.123 --> 28:52.157
the slurring.

28:52.158 --> 28:53.424
Must be neurological.

28:53.425 --> 28:54.458
It would explain
a lot of things,

28:54.459 --> 28:56.127
including her anger.

28:56.128 --> 28:58.129
I mean, this could've been
building up for a year now.

28:58.130 --> 29:00.899
Molly, I need you to get up.

29:00.900 --> 29:02.167
I'm sorry.
Let's get up.

29:02.168 --> 29:03.568
We need to get you
inside, okay?

29:03.569 --> 29:04.669
- Okay.
- Just stand up.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.237
That's it.

29:06.238 --> 29:07.572
- Oh.
- Whoa!

29:07.573 --> 29:10.374
Okay, I want to do
a CT right now.

29:24.724 --> 29:27.619
Okay, scan's complete.
You can come back now.

29:31.697 --> 29:33.131
Yep.

29:33.132 --> 29:35.233
She has significant
obstructive hydrocephalus

29:35.234 --> 29:36.667
caused by this,

29:36.668 --> 29:38.669
a colloid cyst
in the third ventricle.

29:38.670 --> 29:40.171
Episodic hydrocephalus explains

29:40.172 --> 29:42.473
the memory deficits
and behavioral disturbances.

29:42.474 --> 29:44.542
Yep, and her passing out.

29:44.543 --> 29:46.344
Molly?

29:46.345 --> 29:48.922
Molly.

29:51.217 --> 29:53.551
Her pupils are dilated
and minimally reactive.

29:53.552 --> 29:54.953
Her brain is starting
to herniate.

29:54.954 --> 29:56.654
We need to get her to the ER
to relieve the pressure.

29:56.655 --> 29:58.757
She'll never make it.

29:58.758 --> 30:00.471
Get the craniotomy drill.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.271
Mannitol started.

30:06.272 --> 30:07.365
Okay.

30:10.577 --> 30:11.914
Good.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.493
Okay, shaving.

30:20.787 --> 30:22.570
Betadine.

30:24.825 --> 30:26.294
And lidocaine.

30:30.964 --> 30:32.666
And scalpel.

30:38.404 --> 30:41.306
Okay.
Making an incision

30:41.307 --> 30:43.533
anterior to the coronal suture.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.812
Okay. Good.

30:46.813 --> 30:48.319
Retractor.

30:53.186 --> 30:54.820
Ready?

30:54.821 --> 30:57.456
Drill.

31:08.201 --> 31:10.636
Catheter.

31:20.513 --> 31:22.948
Removing fluid.

31:22.949 --> 31:25.317
Okay. Good.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.324
Second syringe.

31:31.624 --> 31:34.026
Okay.

31:34.027 --> 31:35.627
That should
relieve the pressure.

31:38.865 --> 31:41.167
Good.

31:45.906 --> 31:48.074
Molly, hi.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.474
It's Hank.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.877
Listen, you passed out because
of swelling in your brain.

31:51.878 --> 31:53.846
But the pressure's
been relieved.

31:53.847 --> 31:56.348
An ambulance is here,
and you're gonna be all right.

32:06.893 --> 32:09.195
Hey.
I heard about Gina.

32:09.196 --> 32:10.495
She okay?

32:10.496 --> 32:12.098
Oh, yes, uh...

32:12.099 --> 32:14.100
I could barely get
the antibiotics into her,

32:14.101 --> 32:16.702
and she wanted to do a live
report from her hospital bed.

32:16.703 --> 32:18.204
Well, that's good news, right?

32:19.472 --> 32:21.941
So... what did you
want to talk about?

32:25.311 --> 32:26.879
Mm.

32:26.880 --> 32:28.846
This isn't easy.

32:33.186 --> 32:35.341
If you want to talk
about something...

32:35.889 --> 32:39.158
I would welcome us putting it
all out in the open.

33:00.546 --> 33:03.048
Do you think Hank used me?

33:04.717 --> 33:07.719
- What?
- Why do you think...

33:07.720 --> 33:12.564
Hank came specifically
to me for his pain medication?

33:13.726 --> 33:17.462
Jeremiah, uh, you are a doctor.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.965
But he knows other doctors.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.770
And he didn't tell you.

33:24.771 --> 33:26.972
And he didn't even tell...

33:26.973 --> 33:27.973
his brother.

33:27.974 --> 33:30.176
He-- he told me.

33:30.177 --> 33:32.333
The person he knows the least.

33:33.947 --> 33:36.548
Why do you think that is?

33:43.990 --> 33:46.091
I don't know.

33:46.092 --> 33:49.461
Unless he thought
he could use...

33:56.002 --> 33:59.104
Unless...
he thought he could

33:59.105 --> 34:00.605
count on me to give him
what he wanted

34:00.606 --> 34:03.008
without asking questions.

34:03.009 --> 34:06.581
Because I... am...

34:08.380 --> 34:10.135
me.

34:11.985 --> 34:16.088
Jeremiah, you cannot
blame yourself.

34:33.706 --> 34:35.875
This is Gina Black
reporting live

34:35.876 --> 34:38.377
from my hospital bed
at Hamptons Heritage.

34:38.378 --> 34:40.411
Don't worry.
I'm okay.

34:40.413 --> 34:41.847
Thanks to Hankmed.

34:41.848 --> 34:44.016
But I did want to finish
the exciting story

34:44.016 --> 34:45.449
I started this morning.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.887
I have the final
election results.

34:47.888 --> 34:50.889
It turned out to be
a real squeaker.

34:50.891 --> 34:53.913
The new village
councilperson is...

34:54.194 --> 34:56.094
Edwina Bowman.

34:56.096 --> 34:58.563
Who won by a razor-thin

34:58.564 --> 35:00.165
27 votes.

35:00.166 --> 35:01.833
- Sorry, Evan.
- You have to wonder...

35:01.834 --> 35:06.272
if the final negative
campaigning made the difference.

35:06.273 --> 35:10.072
Guess my zoning approval
won't happen in this lifetime.

35:10.676 --> 35:13.078
- I'm sorry, Stu.
- We did our best.

35:13.079 --> 35:15.414
Just give us a minute.

35:18.251 --> 35:19.959
Wow.

35:21.955 --> 35:24.856
I didn't know how much
I wanted this.

35:24.857 --> 35:28.114
Well, the people have spoken.
That's it.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.229
I gave it my best shot.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.083
You certain did.

35:33.099 --> 35:37.078
And maybe this is actually
a blessing in disguise.

35:37.270 --> 35:38.637
How's that?

35:38.638 --> 35:40.505
I miss the old Evan.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.075
And now I get to have
my husband back,

35:43.076 --> 35:44.876
once we get married again.

35:54.921 --> 35:56.555
Oh. Hey.
I got this.

35:56.556 --> 35:58.233
- Sure.
- Thank you.

35:59.725 --> 36:01.893
So, I just spoke
to the neurosurgeon

36:01.894 --> 36:03.329
who removed Molly's cyst,

36:03.330 --> 36:05.730
and he said it couldn't
have gone any better.

36:07.100 --> 36:08.733
The cyst was obstructing
the flow

36:08.734 --> 36:09.935
of cerebrospinal fluid,

36:09.936 --> 36:12.175
which put pressure
on her brain.

36:12.505 --> 36:13.905
That's what was
causing her mood swings.

36:16.509 --> 36:20.512
Don... you, uh,
you okay?

36:20.513 --> 36:23.115
Y-yeah.
I'm just--

36:23.116 --> 36:28.153
To think this is all because
of a medical condition that's...

36:28.154 --> 36:29.754
This has been going on
for a long time?

36:29.755 --> 36:31.256
Well, certainly
since I've met her.

36:31.257 --> 36:32.757
I mean, it's possible
her car accident

36:32.758 --> 36:35.094
was the result of a seizure
caused by the cyst.

36:35.095 --> 36:37.162
Guess it's good that I got
the sarcoidosis, huh?

36:37.163 --> 36:38.430
I mean, if you
hadn't come along,

36:38.431 --> 36:39.731
I'm not sure anybody
would have recognized

36:39.732 --> 36:41.733
what was really going on
with Molly.

36:41.734 --> 36:42.968
Hmm.

36:42.969 --> 36:45.025
I just...

36:46.473 --> 36:49.259
I'm just glad ot know
it wasn't because of me.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.611
That I'm not a bad father.

36:52.612 --> 36:54.946
Please, Don.
You're anything but.

36:54.947 --> 36:57.149
Maybe Molly and I can get back
to where we were.

36:57.150 --> 36:59.184
Ah, don't get too crazy.
She's still a teenager.

36:59.185 --> 37:00.952
Yeah.
I hear you.

37:00.953 --> 37:02.954
And as for you, my friend,

37:02.955 --> 37:04.390
you're gonna have to
slow down a bit.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.158
Your body's been
through the ringer.

37:06.159 --> 37:07.459
I'm way ahead of you.

37:07.460 --> 37:09.395
The only thing I want to be now
is a dad.

37:09.396 --> 37:10.962
I'll let you be the superhero.

37:10.963 --> 37:12.398
Oh, yeah?
You hanging up your cape?

37:12.399 --> 37:13.732
For the time being.

37:13.733 --> 37:15.800
I'm thinking of working
a desk job at the station.

37:15.801 --> 37:16.968
It'll give me more time
with Molly.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.270
She's not gonna
be around forever.

37:18.271 --> 37:20.172
And college is just around
the corner.

37:20.173 --> 37:21.940
Ah, good for you.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.326
Hi, daddy.

37:41.327 --> 37:43.859
Hi, babe.

38:01.184 --> 38:02.952
You sure we won't have to wait?

38:02.953 --> 38:04.287
Yeah, pretty sure.

38:04.288 --> 38:05.755
I printed this form
off their website.

38:05.756 --> 38:06.856
We give 'em this,
they give us another form

38:06.857 --> 38:08.791
so we can then reapply
for a marriage license.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.360
Sounds like a lot of paperwork.

38:10.361 --> 38:12.795
Well, had I been elected,
my first order of business

38:12.796 --> 38:13.829
would have been
to get rid of this form.

38:14.965 --> 38:16.332
Please hurry,
Mr. Lawson.

38:16.333 --> 38:17.967
We've been waiting.

38:17.968 --> 38:20.169
- Oh, well, we have
a 10:30 appointment.

38:20.170 --> 38:21.971
It's 10:31.

38:21.972 --> 38:23.839
Apparently they're
very punctual here.

38:23.840 --> 38:26.766
- Just please come inside.
- Okay, okay.

38:27.144 --> 38:28.636
Thanks.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.714
This is, uh...

38:37.854 --> 38:39.155
Hold this.

38:39.156 --> 38:40.590
Okay.

38:40.591 --> 38:42.992
Put your left hand
on the Bible.

38:42.993 --> 38:45.027
- Who, me?
- Yes.

38:45.028 --> 38:47.032
And raise your right hand.

38:48.165 --> 38:49.932
Do you, Evan R. Lawson,
solemnly swear

38:49.933 --> 38:52.201
to uphold all the rules
and regulations

38:52.202 --> 38:55.438
of the Southampton village
council, so help you God?

38:55.439 --> 38:57.940
I'm sorry, what does this have
to do with getting married?

38:57.941 --> 39:00.276
Nothing.
We're swearing you in.

39:00.277 --> 39:03.479
You're swearing me... in?

39:03.480 --> 39:05.014
But I lost.

39:05.015 --> 39:06.749
By 27 votes.

39:06.750 --> 39:08.818
Actually, you won.

39:08.819 --> 39:11.587
We overlooked the new library
computer polling station.

39:11.588 --> 39:13.889
When we counted those votes
this morning,

39:13.890 --> 39:15.257
you were the winner.

39:15.258 --> 39:16.258
We tried reaching you,

39:16.259 --> 39:18.194
but your voicemail was full.

39:18.195 --> 39:21.230
I guess the voters
are looking for change.

39:21.231 --> 39:23.800
Oh, my God.
I won?

39:23.801 --> 39:25.768
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

39:25.769 --> 39:26.902
Paige, I won!

39:26.903 --> 39:28.771
Oh, my God.

39:28.772 --> 39:31.808
I can't believe I won.
Oh, my God.

39:31.809 --> 39:32.809
I'm sor--

39:32.810 --> 39:34.043
Oh.

39:34.044 --> 39:37.380
Um, do you,
Evan R. Lawson,

39:37.381 --> 39:40.049
solemnly swear to uphold
all the rules and regulations

39:40.050 --> 39:41.551
of the Southampton
village council,

39:41.552 --> 39:43.419
so help you God?

39:43.420 --> 39:45.621
- I do.
- Congratulations.

39:45.622 --> 39:47.790
Congratulations,
Mr. Lawson.

39:47.791 --> 39:50.059
And thank you.

39:50.060 --> 39:51.728
Thank... me?
For what?

39:51.729 --> 39:53.463
For picking up the slack.

39:53.464 --> 39:55.431
How did you put it
on the campaign trail?

39:55.432 --> 39:58.634
Oh, yes, you'll
"Be on the job 24/7."

39:58.635 --> 40:00.102
That's right.

40:00.103 --> 40:02.505
These are the latest
budget reports,

40:02.506 --> 40:05.641
council bylaws,
and village municipal codes.

40:05.642 --> 40:06.976
You may want
to brush up on them

40:06.977 --> 40:08.811
before your meeting
with the Sanitation Department.

40:08.812 --> 40:11.180
Sure. Oh, I have a meeting
with the Sanitation Department?

40:11.181 --> 40:12.849
- In five minutes.
- Oh.

40:12.850 --> 40:14.350
I'll expect a summary
of their findings

40:14.351 --> 40:16.252
and your recommendations
by the end of the week.

40:16.253 --> 40:19.522
- Right.
- So that's that.

40:19.523 --> 40:21.457
Wait, I thought...
village council

40:21.458 --> 40:22.525
only meets once a month.

40:22.526 --> 40:23.893
And you think a congressman

40:23.894 --> 40:25.828
only works when congress
is in session?

40:25.829 --> 40:27.630
No.

40:29.099 --> 40:30.867
You really do have
a lot to learn, Mr. Lawson.

40:30.868 --> 40:33.469
And I guess it will be
up to me to teach you.

40:39.943 --> 40:43.212
This way, Councilman Lawson.

40:43.213 --> 40:44.547
Wait a second.

40:44.548 --> 40:46.482
We, uh, we want to reapply
for a marriage license

40:46.483 --> 40:47.517
and get married.

40:47.518 --> 40:48.885
Who handles that?

40:48.886 --> 40:50.319
Ingrid.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.320
Where's Ingrid?

40:51.321 --> 40:53.022
Uh, maternity leave.

40:53.023 --> 40:55.224
Don't worry, Councilman.

40:55.225 --> 40:57.159
We'll fix it later.

41:01.799 --> 41:03.800
We'll fix it later.

41:09.573 --> 41:12.141
Congratulations, Ev.

41:12.142 --> 41:14.644
That's Councilman Lawson
to you.

41:14.645 --> 41:15.845
Let me get that.

41:15.846 --> 41:18.548
Won't need these
for a while, I hope.

41:18.549 --> 41:21.395
So, wait, you're
no longer Evan R. Lawson,

41:21.450 --> 41:22.699
CFO of Hankmed?

41:22.701 --> 41:24.851
- Of course I am.
- Can you be both?

41:24.853 --> 41:26.536
I am both.
I'm Councilman Evan R. Lawson,

41:26.538 --> 41:27.738
CFO of Hankmed.

41:27.740 --> 41:29.954
Ah, good luck
with that business card.

41:31.243 --> 41:32.859
Ugh, really?

41:32.861 --> 41:34.327
- In the chips?
- It worked.

41:34.329 --> 41:36.362
- You voted.
- I didn't say for who.

41:36.364 --> 41:37.547
Nah.

41:37.549 --> 41:39.699
No, but seriously,

41:39.701 --> 41:42.161
I'm so proud of you,
little brother.

41:42.721 --> 41:46.089
I mean, you beat Edwina
and Blythe frickin' Ballard.

41:46.091 --> 41:48.008
Finally.

41:48.010 --> 41:50.752
Well, that remains
to be seen, but thanks.

41:52.181 --> 41:53.430
What's this?

41:56.484 --> 41:57.967
I don't know.

41:58.520 --> 41:59.886
"Evan."

41:59.888 --> 42:01.655
- It was just there?
- Yeah.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.208
What?

42:17.539 --> 42:19.756
Jeremiah resigned from Hankmed.

42:19.758 --> 42:21.741
Effectively immediately.
