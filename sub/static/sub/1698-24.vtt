WEBVTT

00:04.460 --> 00:07.230
Lilly! Lilly!

00:07.230 --> 00:11.730
OK, guess who is crushing big time?

00:11.730 --> 00:13.300
Aw, Miley, not again.

00:13.300 --> 00:16.630
Even Jeff Gordon makes a pit
stop every once in a while.

00:16.630 --> 00:18.930
I am not talking about me.

00:18.930 --> 00:21.830
Although, uh, tall,
dark and yummy over there

00:21.830 --> 00:23.900
is definitely on my radar.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.160
Miley.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.160
Right.

00:28.160 --> 00:31.100
Anyhoo, I'm talking about Oliver.

00:31.100 --> 00:32.980
He is in love.

00:32.980 --> 00:34.230
Are you sure?

00:34.230 --> 00:35.830
I was just in the girl's bathroom

00:35.830 --> 00:39.760
and there was nobody sobbing,
"Why me, why me?"

00:39.760 --> 00:41.230
I'm sure.

00:41.230 --> 00:45.000
I saw him upstairs and he was
totally distracted and spacy.

00:53.730 --> 00:57.300
I guess you're right. That's love.
Painful, painful love.

00:57.300 --> 01:00.130
Hey, how's it going?

01:00.130 --> 01:03.100
Nice kicks, Timmy.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.459
Spill it, Oliver. Who is she?

01:05.459 --> 01:06.960
Who's who?

01:06.960 --> 01:12.060
The girl you've fallen for...
all the way down the stairs.

01:12.930 --> 01:14.350
There's no girl.

01:14.350 --> 01:15.030
Oh, really?

01:15.030 --> 01:18.400
Then, uh, how do you explain
this box of chocolates?

01:19.160 --> 01:22.100
All right, fine.
They're for a girl.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.120
What's her name?

01:23.120 --> 01:24.660
She's not even in our grade.

01:24.660 --> 01:25.960
You don't know her.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.670
Come on, you know
you want to tell us.

01:27.670 --> 01:28.430
Yeah.

01:29.630 --> 01:32.800
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.260
Tell us. Tell us. Tell us. Tell us.

01:35.260 --> 01:35.890
Come on.

01:35.890 --> 01:36.200
Tell us.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.560
Guys, I really...

01:37.560 --> 01:38.190
Come on.

01:38.190 --> 01:38.660
Tell us.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.460
Come on, guys!
Just leave me alone, OK?

01:44.100 --> 01:45.980
I've never seen him like this.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.900
I know.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.130
Maybe we should
respect his privacy.

01:49.130 --> 01:50.110
Yeah.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.360
Although, if we
respect it too long,

01:53.360 --> 01:55.380
we'll lose his trail. Come on.

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:04.300 --> 02:06.760
Thank you, Oliver.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.300
The ones with the little
squigglies on top are the best.

02:18.730 --> 02:21.430
I'm going to take AP English.

02:21.430 --> 02:23.930
I'm going to take AP Water Polo.

02:23.930 --> 02:26.130
Good night, nurse!

02:26.130 --> 02:28.000
Oliver is crushing
on someone old enough

02:28.000 --> 02:29.630
to remember The Beatles.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.060
The who?

02:31.060 --> 02:32.200
Them, too.

03:27.300 --> 03:30.030
Well, he did say she
wasn't in our grade.

03:30.030 --> 03:34.130
Not in our grade?
She ain't in our generation.

03:34.130 --> 03:37.700
Ooh! Hey, that's a good one.
I can't wait to use it on him.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.960
No! You can't!

03:39.960 --> 03:41.500
Remember in seventh grade

03:41.500 --> 03:46.060
when you had a crush on Monsieur Garneau,
the French teacher?

03:46.060 --> 03:48.760
Vaguely.

03:48.760 --> 03:53.030
Please, you wore a beret
and said oui, oui so much,

03:53.030 --> 03:55.860
people started calling you "
Tinkles Truscott."

03:56.640 --> 03:59.480
OK, fine. But, people made
fun of me, I got over it.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.040
Now nobody even remembers.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.000
Hey, Tinkles.

04:03.460 --> 04:05.460
We've got some stale
French fries here.

04:05.460 --> 04:07.900
And we know how you
like things that are...

04:07.900 --> 04:11.830
...old and French. Ooh, la, la!

04:15.100 --> 04:16.959
That was two years ago!

04:16.959 --> 04:20.360
Yeah! She's had a ton of
boyfriends since then!

04:20.360 --> 04:23.260
OK, fine, two. And Lucas cheated on her,
so that doesn't really count.

04:23.260 --> 04:25.230
And the other one she took
to court, but if you...

04:25.230 --> 04:26.830
Stop helping me!

04:28.030 --> 04:30.760
I get it. We can't
make fun of Oliver.

04:30.760 --> 04:33.430
For this. Everything
else is fair game, right?

04:33.430 --> 04:35.740
Of course. Now we
just got to protect

04:35.740 --> 04:37.860
him from the trash-talking twins.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.340
How?

04:39.340 --> 04:40.300
Simple.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.710
We get him nursing on a new crush,

04:42.710 --> 04:44.830
not crushing on an old nurse.

04:44.830 --> 04:47.590
Another good one I can't use.

04:47.590 --> 04:48.600
Come on.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.830
Ma, you may want to
sit down for this one.

04:55.830 --> 04:59.430
Jackson, your grandson, got a "B."

05:01.660 --> 05:04.430
I told you,
you may want to sit down.

05:04.430 --> 05:08.060
Yep, and it's all because of
this new girlfriend he's got.

05:08.060 --> 05:10.460
I'll tell you what,
she is smart as a whip,

05:10.460 --> 05:13.680
and you ain't gonna believe what
an influence she's been on him.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.560
Hey, here they come. I got to go.

05:16.560 --> 05:18.800
If you can't get up, call me back.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.960
There he is! My "B" boy
and his "A"-plus lady.

05:23.960 --> 05:24.400
Dad.

05:24.400 --> 05:25.760
Hi, Mr. Stewart.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.060
Little lady, from now on you can
just call me, "Happy Pappy!"

05:30.060 --> 05:34.000
He's not really my dad.
I was left on his doorstep.

05:34.830 --> 05:37.060
By a wizard.

05:37.060 --> 05:38.960
Aw, son. Come on, now.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.730
I didn't mean to embarrass you,
but look at this!

05:41.730 --> 05:43.460
You made the refrigerator!

05:44.630 --> 05:46.560
I'm sorry.

05:46.560 --> 05:49.300
Just got a little dust in my eye,
that's all.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.560
What'll he do when he finds out
about your "A" on the History quiz?

05:52.560 --> 05:55.660
Oh. That's a risk I can't take.

05:58.430 --> 06:01.290
OK, I'm just going
to go for a jog now

06:01.290 --> 06:05.030
and leave you two do your...
studying.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.860
I'm sorry, more dust.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.160
Hey, Monica. Yeah,
we're studying for the Chem test.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.060
I don't know.

06:21.060 --> 06:24.060
He's cute, but I'm just
not feeling it anymore.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.730
I was gonna break
up with him today.

06:26.730 --> 06:28.230
No.

06:28.230 --> 06:29.630
But I just can't.

06:31.430 --> 06:33.150
I'll wait until after
the test tomorrow.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.000
Pull it together, old man.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.400
It's not like it's the
last "B" I'll ever get.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.730
Wanna bet?

06:51.730 --> 06:56.860
OK, who's the lucky lady who's
gonna break the nurse curse?

06:56.860 --> 06:59.830
Hey, what about Stephanie?
She's cute.

06:59.830 --> 07:02.500
And on last year's field trip
she sat in front of Oliver.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.260
Oh, yeah.

07:04.260 --> 07:06.930
He scarfed down three hot dogs
before they got on the bus...

07:06.930 --> 07:09.960
...and she was wearing
them when they got off.

07:11.830 --> 07:13.650
No problem. I'm sure there's,

07:13.650 --> 07:15.660
uh, plenty of girls for Oliver.

07:15.660 --> 07:17.630
Yeah. Well, let's see.

07:17.630 --> 07:18.680
Tripped her,

07:18.680 --> 07:19.700
sat on her lunch,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.360
spilled on,

07:21.360 --> 07:23.060
spilled on.

07:24.660 --> 07:26.900
And poor Pamela...

07:26.900 --> 07:33.460
...the only survivor of the Oken
natural gas disaster of 2006.

07:33.460 --> 07:35.430
This may be harder than we thought.

07:37.660 --> 07:39.480
Oh, no. There she is.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.400
Sweet old lady doesn't
suspect a thing.

07:44.060 --> 07:46.700
Loverboy's at it again. Let's go.

08:02.200 --> 08:03.830
Hey, guys. What's up?

08:03.830 --> 08:06.760
Oh, Miley, did you get
hit by a football again?

08:07.560 --> 08:08.130
No.

08:08.130 --> 08:09.130
Soccer ball?

08:09.130 --> 08:10.050
No.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.000
Boomerang?

08:11.000 --> 08:14.130
No! I'm fine. This isn't about me.

08:14.130 --> 08:19.760
It's about Oliver and you and
the chocolates and that note.

08:21.230 --> 08:23.440
So, you know?

08:23.440 --> 08:24.160
Yeah.

08:24.160 --> 08:28.110
Oh, I am so glad he told you.

08:28.110 --> 08:28.830
You are?

08:28.830 --> 08:34.530
Absolutely. He wanted this to be,
uh, our little secret.

08:34.530 --> 08:37.200
But I told him there was
nothing to be ashamed of.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.460
You did?

08:39.460 --> 08:42.659
Of course. Oliver didn't
ask for this to happen.

08:42.659 --> 08:45.300
I mean, none of us ever do.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.260
But when it does,
you can either run away from it

08:48.260 --> 08:49.820
or you can embrace it.

08:50.140 --> 08:52.680
And you want him to embrace it?

08:53.530 --> 08:54.860
Oh, I've begged him to.

08:54.860 --> 08:57.430
And now that he has,
I couldn't be happier.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.060
You're kidding me, right?

09:00.780 --> 09:03.370
Why would I kid about
Oliver having diabetes?

09:03.370 --> 09:05.160
What?

09:09.360 --> 09:11.340
Oliver has diabetes?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.220
Of course. What did you
think I was talking about?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.500
Diabetes.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.060
Oliver has diabetes.

09:17.260 --> 09:19.100
She meant to say it with a period,

09:19.460 --> 09:22.140
but she said it with a
question mark by mistake.

09:22.140 --> 09:23.040
Right, Lilly?

09:23.270 --> 09:24.520
Uh. Oh, yeah.

09:24.520 --> 09:25.860
It's a teenage girl thing?

09:25.860 --> 09:26.740
We all do it?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.180
My mom hates it?

09:29.260 --> 09:31.140
Wait a minute, you didn't
think that Oliver...

09:31.140 --> 09:32.380
No!

09:32.580 --> 09:33.640
Because I would never...

09:33.640 --> 09:35.100
Of course not!

09:35.100 --> 09:36.060
I mean, Oliver?

09:36.060 --> 09:37.300
We know.

09:37.860 --> 09:40.180
I mean, let's face it,

09:40.180 --> 09:42.340
you still have a couple
of good years left.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.940
You could do a lot better.

09:44.740 --> 09:46.330
Gee, thanks.

09:48.820 --> 09:49.940
Poor Oliver.

09:50.010 --> 09:52.860
I know. I just want
to give him a big hug.

09:53.100 --> 09:55.100
Oh, this is why he gave
her the chocolates,

09:55.100 --> 09:57.180
so he wouldn't eat them.
When you have diabetes,

09:57.180 --> 09:59.200
you're not supposed to
have a lot of sugar.

10:00.340 --> 10:02.760
Wait a minute.
You guys didn't know, did you?

10:05.780 --> 10:08.100
Oh, boy. OK, listen.

10:08.620 --> 10:10.620
You can live a very
full life with diabetes,

10:10.620 --> 10:12.620
but this is still all
very new to Oliver

10:12.620 --> 10:13.860
and he's struggling with it.

10:13.860 --> 10:16.060
So, please, let him tell you. OK?

10:16.600 --> 10:18.220
But, what if he doesn't?

10:18.290 --> 10:20.220
Yeah, we're his friends.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.460
I mean, we want to help him.

10:22.460 --> 10:25.030
So you're just gonna
have to be patient, OK?

10:25.740 --> 10:27.820
OK. We can do that.

10:32.780 --> 10:35.100
We can't do this!

10:38.030 --> 10:42.340
It says here that Oliver's body 
just doesn't process sugar the way it's supposed to.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.060
But if he takes his insulin

10:44.130 --> 10:48.300
and doesn't eat too many sweets,
he can lead a normal life.

10:49.020 --> 10:52.060
I do not know why he is
so afraid to tell us.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.080
I could totally help him
stay away from sugar.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.530
I agree. You are quite
the little role model.

11:06.130 --> 11:08.030
That's not the point.

11:08.030 --> 11:10.060
I mean, he's gonna
tell us eventually.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.230
What's he waiting for?

11:11.230 --> 11:12.460
I can't imagine.

11:12.460 --> 11:14.100
It's not like you didn't tell him

11:14.100 --> 11:16.400
you were Hannah Montana
right off the bat.

11:16.400 --> 11:21.350
I mean, you didn't keep him waiting,
and waiting, and waiting, and waiting...

11:21.350 --> 11:23.160
I got the point, Captain Subtle.

11:24.460 --> 11:26.160
Hey, I got a great idea.

11:26.160 --> 11:29.130
Why don't you take him
to Traci's party tonight?

11:29.130 --> 11:33.600
Hang out, have fun,
get his mind off things.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.100
That's actually a good idea.

11:37.580 --> 11:40.060
I do have those on occasion,
you know.

11:40.060 --> 11:43.400
It's not like I'm one
of those dopey TV dads.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.800
You keep telling
yourself that, big fella.

11:50.300 --> 11:54.130
Oh. My little B-boy.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.430
I hardly knew you.

11:59.300 --> 12:02.500
OK. OK. So, what do you
call a pig who knows karate?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.260
A pork chop! Hi-ya!

12:05.830 --> 12:08.800
Jackson! Allison!

12:08.800 --> 12:12.900
You're here! Together!
That's great!

12:12.900 --> 12:17.330
You are a beautiful couple.

12:17.330 --> 12:20.930
Don't worry, he always gets like
this just before nappy time, huh?

12:20.930 --> 12:22.960
I'll be right back.

12:24.630 --> 12:26.960
Don't blow this for me!

12:26.960 --> 12:28.460
She said she wants to "talk,"

12:28.460 --> 12:30.700
and I think we both
know what that means.

12:30.700 --> 12:33.500
Well, one of us does.

12:33.500 --> 12:37.130
Look, I don't have time for
your riddles, old man. Just go.

12:37.130 --> 12:39.200
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:59.030 --> 13:02.030
I... am just, uh,
dancing over to you

13:02.030 --> 13:07.260
because I can't wait to "talk."

13:08.330 --> 13:09.400
Ready when you are.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.860
Actually, I really
did want to talk.

13:11.860 --> 13:14.960
Really? OK.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.360
Well, I guess we could,
you know, start with that.

13:17.360 --> 13:19.420
Listen, Jackson. I...

13:19.420 --> 13:22.330
Hey! Um, before I take my nap,

13:22.330 --> 13:24.460
I just wanted to say to you

13:24.460 --> 13:30.900
that you are the best girlfriend
Jackson has ever had. Ever.

13:30.900 --> 13:32.360
And he's had a lot of them.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.430
I cannot keep the
ladies off of this one.

13:35.430 --> 13:38.730
Dad, we're trying to have a
little conversation here.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.860
Conversation? Oh,
you don't want to do that.

13:41.860 --> 13:44.660
Talking's the quickest way
to ruin a relationship.

13:44.660 --> 13:47.460
Hey, let me ask you,
have you kissed him yet?

13:47.460 --> 13:51.830
All the ladies say he's
got lips like butter.

13:51.830 --> 13:52.640
Dad!

13:52.640 --> 13:55.700
Oh, son, don't be modest.

13:55.700 --> 14:00.300
You know, Stewart men only
get better-looking with age.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.760
Exhibit A.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.850
Could you excuse us?

14:04.850 --> 14:05.530
OK.

14:05.530 --> 14:09.200
Did I happen to mention he's
gonna inherit a lot of money?

14:10.360 --> 14:11.860
What are you doing?

14:11.860 --> 14:13.830
I'm trying to get you into college.

14:13.830 --> 14:16.160
How? By humiliating me?

14:16.160 --> 14:18.700
By saving this relationship.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.300
I heard her on the phone yesterday.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.560
She's gonna break up with you.

14:22.560 --> 14:24.260
Whah?

14:25.400 --> 14:26.830
Sorry, son.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.960
Is that true? You want
to break up with me?

14:32.030 --> 14:33.530
Yeah.

14:35.130 --> 14:37.900
And I didn't know
exactly how to say it.

14:37.900 --> 14:39.700
Thank you so much, Mr. Stewart.

14:41.660 --> 14:45.460
Wow, that was easier
than I thought.

14:49.830 --> 14:54.430
It's just so unfair.
I did everything I could.

14:54.430 --> 14:56.430
What more did she want?

14:58.560 --> 15:01.130
Look, these things happen.

15:01.130 --> 15:05.030
How can you be so OK with this?

15:05.030 --> 15:09.530
Well, I just found out that I'm
going to inherit a ton of money!

15:11.200 --> 15:14.100
And get even better-looking!

15:14.100 --> 15:18.430
And you said I
needed college! Yeah!

15:22.400 --> 15:24.860
Oh, come on, guys. It'll be fun.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.430
You guys, I don't know.
I've got a ton of homework.

15:27.430 --> 15:28.420
Maybe I should just go home.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.460
Oliver, you are not
thinking clearly, OK?

15:30.460 --> 15:35.860
This is Traci's sweet sixteen.
There's gonna be a ton of sweet sixteens.

15:35.860 --> 15:38.030
Know what I mean? Eh?

15:38.030 --> 15:40.130
What do you mean?

15:40.130 --> 15:43.860
There'll be a lot of cute girls.
Pretty girls.

15:43.860 --> 15:46.830
Better yet, girls that haven't
formed an opinion of you yet.

15:47.930 --> 15:51.460
Oh, and you know, sometimes it's
good to take a break from things,

15:51.460 --> 15:55.560
like homework or stuff that might
be weighing heavily on your mind.

15:55.560 --> 15:57.860
Or lightly.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.860
You know, stuff
that seems heavy now

15:59.860 --> 16:03.000
but with time and the support
of your great friends...

16:03.000 --> 16:04.080
...and a well-balanced diet...

16:04.080 --> 16:05.230
...life can be a wonderful thing!

16:05.230 --> 16:07.160
A wonderful, wonderful thing!

16:07.160 --> 16:11.000
OK. I'm thinking your wigs are
on a little bit too tight.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.630
And you are right.
See, we need you.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.930
We are not stable.
Come on, let's go have fun!

16:15.930 --> 16:17.430
Yeah!

16:24.760 --> 16:28.130
Oh, my gosh,
look at all the cupcakes.

16:28.130 --> 16:30.130
Uh, yeah, you really should
get that homework done.

16:30.130 --> 16:31.560
It's not gonna do itself. Let's go.

16:31.560 --> 16:32.760
Hannah!

16:32.760 --> 16:35.330
Welcome to my sweet sixteen.

16:35.330 --> 16:37.500
Emphasis on the sweet.

16:37.500 --> 16:40.330
Yep, everything looks great here.
Happy B-day. Air kiss!

16:40.330 --> 16:41.820
Gotta go, bye!

16:41.820 --> 16:43.330
But you just got here.

16:43.330 --> 16:46.700
Let's split the difference.
Ciao, Lola.

16:46.700 --> 16:49.460
No, see, we all
gotta get outta here

16:49.460 --> 16:52.330
'cause I have a headache, he's got
 homework to do, and she just can't stand ya.

16:53.630 --> 16:55.200
OK, it can wait.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.500
Like you said, life can be a
wonderful, wonderful thing.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.800
Hello there, wonderful thing.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.560
So it's settled! You're staying!

17:05.560 --> 17:10.130
And, seriously, I have a
driver if you need a ride home.

17:10.130 --> 17:14.599
And, seriously, nobody here
really thinks you're sixteen.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.530
Yeah.

17:16.530 --> 17:18.300
Bye.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.829
Yeah, bring him along!
It'll be fun!

17:23.829 --> 17:25.280
Thanks a lot, Dad.

17:25.280 --> 17:27.160
What are we supposed to do now?

17:27.160 --> 17:28.460
Why does it always have to be me?

17:28.460 --> 17:31.530
Don't you have an idea?
A suggestion?

17:31.530 --> 17:34.000
Something to get the ball rolling?

17:34.000 --> 17:38.330
Hello! What do you want me to do,
eat every cupcake,

17:38.330 --> 17:40.700
cookie and brownie before he does?

17:40.700 --> 17:42.470
Finally, something useful!

17:42.470 --> 17:43.330
Yeah!

17:43.330 --> 17:46.730
Yeah! I had a good idea,
yes I did. Ooh, ooh!

17:46.730 --> 17:50.430
Getting a pet rat so at least
you look good next to something?

17:50.430 --> 17:52.630
Yeah, what size collar do you wear?

17:56.230 --> 17:59.410
Ooh, sweet things everywhere I look,
know what I mean?

17:59.410 --> 18:00.700
Oh, here you go.

18:00.700 --> 18:03.260
Ooh! Thank you! Don't mind if I do!

18:03.260 --> 18:05.530
He's such a gentleman.

18:05.530 --> 18:07.430
What are you guys doing?

18:07.430 --> 18:08.730
I'm just hungry.

18:08.730 --> 18:10.630
Really, really hungry.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.230
So I said to her, "Beyonc?
in my book, you're A-yonc?"

18:21.230 --> 18:22.800
Right?

18:25.530 --> 18:27.030
What are you doing?

18:27.030 --> 18:28.350
I love licorice. Hmm...

18:28.350 --> 18:29.870
Go get your own.

18:29.870 --> 18:30.900
There's no more!

18:30.900 --> 18:32.760
She's got a whole tray over there.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.530
They're like potato chips.
Can't have just one.

18:37.530 --> 18:39.260
Let's go!

18:39.260 --> 18:41.460
Celebrities.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.630
They think they're
entitled to everything.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.560
Wait! I don't know
where the food went.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.160
I got enough to feed a whale!

19:02.160 --> 19:04.130
Or two.

19:04.130 --> 19:05.360
Well, the good news is,

19:05.360 --> 19:08.030
we saved Oliver from all that...

19:08.030 --> 19:12.430
...sugar. I never thought I'd
hate the taste of a brownie.

19:12.430 --> 19:17.400
Hey, where is Oliver,
anyway? I can't see him.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.930
I can't see my belt.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.400
Where'd everybody go?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.200
Party's... over.

19:25.200 --> 19:27.400
Halle... lujah.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.600
Hey, you know, I never
even got anything to eat.

19:34.260 --> 19:35.730
Finally.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.060
No!

19:45.930 --> 19:47.910
What is wrong with you guys?

19:47.910 --> 19:49.160
We, uh...

19:49.160 --> 19:51.530
We really like cupcakes.

19:51.530 --> 19:54.060
And we know about your diabetes.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.200
You do?

19:56.200 --> 19:58.700
Yeah, the school nurse told us.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.660
And we couldn't just stand by
and let you eat that cupcake.

20:01.660 --> 20:06.660
Or this cupcake,
or this cupcake, or...

20:06.660 --> 20:09.100
...this pie.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.360
You guys think I can't eat this
stuff because I have diabetes?

20:14.360 --> 20:18.430
Well, yeah. I mean, I think so.

20:18.430 --> 20:21.600
I didn't get to finish that pamphlet
because I got ice cream all over it.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.590
Shh! Don't say "ice
cream" in front of him.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.360
Sorry.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.260
Guys, I have Type 1 diabetes.

20:26.260 --> 20:28.500
Which means I can have
stuff with sugar in it.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.900
As long as I manage my diet,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.260
I monitor my blood
sugar with this...

20:34.630 --> 20:37.560
Actually, according to this,
my blood sugar's low.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.960
Which means I actually need
something like a brownie...

20:42.030 --> 20:43.260
...if there were any left.

20:43.260 --> 20:45.400
Oh, wait, wait...

20:47.100 --> 20:48.780
Kept that warm for ya.

20:49.160 --> 20:51.460
Gee, thanks.

20:52.530 --> 20:57.800
Look, Oliver, I'm sorry,
but why didn't you tell us?

20:57.800 --> 20:59.600
I don't know.

20:59.600 --> 21:01.900
I didn't want you guys to
look at me like I was broken,

21:01.900 --> 21:02.990
because I'm not.

21:02.990 --> 21:05.860
Well, we would have known
that if you'd have told us.

21:05.860 --> 21:08.830
Yeah, I know. And I should have.

21:08.830 --> 21:11.960
And I guess I should have
rinsed off that pamphlet

21:11.960 --> 21:15.000
before we became the food police.

21:17.130 --> 21:20.030
Hmm. It's chocolatey...

21:20.030 --> 21:22.830
...and it's got, like,
a hint of, uh...

21:22.830 --> 21:26.400
...pineapple? Mango?

21:26.400 --> 21:31.230
Uh, that's uh... that's my
"tropical mist" deodorant.

21:32.860 --> 21:35.180
Maybe we should just stop by a
smoothie place on the way home?

21:35.180 --> 21:36.260
Good idea.

21:43.700 --> 21:46.230
Tonight, we learned a
lot of important things.

21:46.230 --> 21:51.230
Yeah. I learned that 40 kids get
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes every day.

21:51.230 --> 21:53.630
And I learned you can't get it
from eating too many sweets.

21:53.630 --> 21:55.960
And I learned if you take
your insulin appropriately,

21:55.960 --> 21:57.800
exercise, and eat a balanced diet,

21:57.800 --> 22:00.500
you can do anything and be
anything you want to be.

22:00.500 --> 22:04.230
And I learned that someday,
I'm gonna be good-looking.

22:04.230 --> 22:07.860
And, I'm gonna inherit a
lot of money. Whoo-hoo!

22:07.860 --> 22:10.160
And I learned that my
brother's really annoying.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.750
Oh, wait, I already knew that.
