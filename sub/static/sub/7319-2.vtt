WEBVTT

00:12.400 --> 00:14.467
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.500 --> 00:16.533
LAST NIGHT,
YOU AND SHEPHERD DID IT?

00:16.567 --> 00:19.200
MEREDITH...
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

00:19.233 --> 00:20.567
(Meredith) UH...
I HAD PANTIES ON.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.833
(Izzie) I THOUGHT I WAS
A SURGEON, BUT I AM NOT...

00:22.867 --> 00:26.100
SHE CUT HIS LVAD WIRE.
SO I QUIT.

00:26.133 --> 00:28.033
(Adele) IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO MAKE A CHOICE--

00:28.067 --> 00:30.067
ME OR THIS HOSPITAL.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.500
GOOD-BYE, RICHARD.
(George) YOU LIVE HERE?

00:32.533 --> 00:33.567
(Callie)
I'M NOT CRAZY OR ANYTHING.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.433
I JUST SPEND SO MUCH TIME
HERE IN THE HOSPITAL.

00:35.467 --> 00:37.467
ARE YOU GONNA TELL SHEPHERD
ABOUT...

00:37.500 --> 00:38.700
(Preston) NOT YET.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.300
(Meredith) WHAT DOES
THIS MEAN?

00:40.333 --> 00:42.133
(Derek) IT MEANS
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.700
***

00:46.433 --> 00:48.433
(Meredith)
AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT,

00:48.467 --> 00:51.133
THE BRAIN HAS
14 BILLION NEURONS FIRING

00:51.167 --> 00:54.667
AT A SPEED
OF 450 MILES PER HOUR.

00:54.700 --> 00:59.433
WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL
OVER MOST OF THEM...

00:59.467 --> 01:01.333
WHEN WE GET A CHILL--
GOOSE BUMPS,

01:01.367 --> 01:06.633
WHEN WE GET EXCITED--
ADRENALINE.

01:06.667 --> 01:10.067
THE BODY NATURALLY FOLLOWS
ITS IMPULSES,

01:10.067 --> 01:12.367
WHICH I THINK IS PART OF
WHAT MAKES IT SO HARD

01:12.400 --> 01:13.833
FOR US TO CONTROL OURS.

01:13.867 --> 01:15.700
IT'S ENOUGH MUFFINS.

01:15.733 --> 01:17.633
WE DON'T NEED ALL THESE.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.167
NO MORE MUFFINS.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.067
***

01:24.467 --> 01:26.767
OF COURSE,
SOMETIMES WE HAVE IMPULSES

01:26.800 --> 01:28.733
WE WOULD RATHER NOT CONTROL...

01:28.767 --> 01:32.433
***

01:39.333 --> 01:41.833
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:41.867 --> 01:44.333
JUST BECAUSE YOU CAN'T TOUCH

01:44.367 --> 01:47.333
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN'T ENJOY.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.400
THAT WE LATER WISH
WE HAD.

01:50.433 --> 01:51.633
MAMA. DADDY.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.600
OH, MY--

01:52.633 --> 01:54.067
PRESTON.

01:54.100 --> 01:56.100
MAMA AND DADDY?!

01:56.133 --> 01:59.467
IS THIS A NEW SERVICE
THE HOSPITAL IS PROVIDING?

02:02.267 --> 02:04.533
I TOLD YOU
TO GUARD THE DOOR!

02:04.567 --> 02:06.500
I HAD A CODE BLUE.
I HAD PARENTS WALK IN.

02:06.533 --> 02:07.767
WE SAVED THE GUY'S LIFE.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.700
WHATEVER. YOU KNOW,
I WANT MY 20 BUCKS BACK.

02:09.733 --> 02:11.400
SORRY.
BOUGHT EVERYONE COFFEE...

02:11.433 --> 02:13.300
TO CELEBRATE SAVING
THE GUY'S LIFE.

02:13.333 --> 02:15.233
YEAH, I WANT
MY 20 BUCKS BACK.

02:15.267 --> 02:17.233
IT'S NOT TYLER'S FAULT
YOU'RE A DIRTY, DIRTY STRIPPER.

02:17.267 --> 02:18.767
(sighs) YOU HEARD.

02:18.800 --> 02:20.400
EVERYONE HEARD...

02:20.433 --> 02:22.367
STRIPPER.

02:22.400 --> 02:24.167
OH, OH, YOU'RE ONE
TO TALK,

02:24.200 --> 02:26.100
SLEEPING WITH TWO MEN.

02:26.133 --> 02:28.600
WRONG. I'M NOT SLEEPING
WITH EITHER ONE OF THEM...

02:28.633 --> 02:30.400
MM-HMM.
NOT UNTIL I PICK ONE.

02:30.433 --> 02:33.300
IF I HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION
BY THE END OF THE DAY,

02:33.333 --> 02:34.500
I'M FLIPPING A COIN.

02:34.533 --> 02:36.400
A GIRL CAN ONLY HOLD OUT
FOR SO LONG.

02:36.433 --> 02:39.067
OH, AND SOMEHOW
I'M THE DIRTY STRIPPER? HUH.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.800
YOU TWO HAVE TIME
TO ROUND,

02:40.833 --> 02:42.733
OR ARE YOU TOO BUSY
GETTING NAKED

02:42.767 --> 02:44.067
ON HOSPITAL PROPERTY?

02:44.067 --> 02:46.633
NO, I WASN'T NAKED.
I-I WASN'T NAKED.

02:49.867 --> 02:52.533
YOU'VE GOT A COFFEE STAIN
ON YOUR SHIRT.

02:52.567 --> 02:55.333
YOU HAD A BED
ON YOUR COUCH.

02:55.367 --> 02:57.267
HOPE YOU'RE NOT PLANNING
TO SEE PATIENTS

02:57.300 --> 03:00.100
IN YOUR SWEAT SUIT.

03:00.133 --> 03:03.100
ACTUALLY, UM...
I NEED THE DAY OFF.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.267
A DAY OFF, FOR WHAT?

03:04.300 --> 03:05.700
FOR DRINKING.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.700
I AM FEELING THE NEED
TO DO SOME DRINKING.

03:08.733 --> 03:11.567
ACTUALLY, I'M FEELING THE NEED
TO DO SOME CRYING,

03:11.600 --> 03:13.733
BUT MY TEAR DUCTS
SEEM TO BE TOO PROUD,

03:13.767 --> 03:16.100
SO I'M GOING TO DO
SOME DRINKING INSTEAD.

03:16.133 --> 03:20.600
WHAT,
NO LABORING MOMS TODAY?

03:20.633 --> 03:22.267
NO.

03:22.300 --> 03:25.233
BECAUSE I THINK
GOD KNOWS THAT...

03:25.267 --> 03:29.333
I NEED TO DO
SOME DRINKING TODAY.

03:29.367 --> 03:31.267
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT,
ADDIE,

03:31.300 --> 03:34.267
OR YOU JUST WANNA BE GLIB
A LITTLE LONGER?

03:34.300 --> 03:37.067
WHY ARE YOU LIVING
IN YOUR OFFICE?

03:37.100 --> 03:38.500
(sighs)

03:38.533 --> 03:41.267
MARRIAGE... IS HARD.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.167
WELL... THANK GOODNESS

03:43.200 --> 03:45.633
MINE SEEMS TO BE
JUST ABOUT OVER.

03:52.367 --> 03:53.400
MMM.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.733
MS. SEABURY, WHAT--
WHAT ARE--

03:55.767 --> 03:59.233
NO, I'M--I'M SORRY.
YOU CANNOT BE EATING.

03:59.267 --> 04:01.500
WHAT IS ALL OF THIS?
THIS IS CHOCOLATE RASPBERRY
SOUFFLÃ© CAKE.

04:01.533 --> 04:04.067
IT IS THE BEST THING
I'VE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.333
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE
THE BANANA CREAM TORTE THERE.

04:06.367 --> 04:08.233
IT'S PRETTY STUNNING, REALLY.

04:08.267 --> 04:10.100
BAKERIES DELIVER. DID YOU
KNOW THAT? PLEASE, GRAB A FORK.

04:10.133 --> 04:13.500
MS. SEABURY, YOU'RE SCHEDULED
FOR SURGERY THIS AFTERNOON.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.233
WE PUSH THE SURGERY
A LITTLE. TOMORROW, MAYBE?

04:15.267 --> 04:16.800
OH, MY GOD.
YOU'VE GOTTA TASTE THIS.

04:16.833 --> 04:19.533
MA'AM, YOU HAVE AN AGGRESSIVE
FORM OF LUNG CANCER.

04:19.567 --> 04:20.900
THE SOONER WE GET YOU
INTO SURGERY,

04:20.933 --> 04:22.800
THE BETTER YOUR CHANCES--
THE BETTER MY CHANCES
OF SURVIVING.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.733
SO I HEARD.
IT'S ALL VERY AGGRESSIVE.

04:24.767 --> 04:27.633
I MEAN, IT'S VERY...
(laughing)

04:29.400 --> 04:31.533
IT'S FUNNY.
(laughing continues)

04:31.567 --> 04:33.467
I HAVE NEVER SMOKED
A CIGARETTE IN MY LIFE.

04:33.500 --> 04:36.267
I HAVE NEVER SMOKED POT.
I'VE NEVER DRANK.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.067
BEFORE TODAY, I HADN'T HAD
A DESSERT IN TEN YEARS.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.633
I AM THE PICTURE OF HEALTH,
AND I HAVE LUNG CANCER.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.800
(laughs) I MEAN, COME ON.
IT'S ABSURD, RIGHT?

04:45.833 --> 04:47.433
I'M SORRY.

04:47.467 --> 04:49.433
I THINK
I'M ON A SUGAR HIGH.

04:49.467 --> 04:51.433
I'M SORRY. (laughing)

04:52.767 --> 04:56.400
O'MALLEY, RESCHEDULE
HER SURGERY FOR TOMORROW

04:56.433 --> 04:58.333
AND GET HER A PSYCH CONSULT.
YES, SIR.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.067
AND NO MORE FOOD DELIVERIES.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.800
YES, SIR.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.067
OKAY.

05:04.100 --> 05:06.533
(under breath)
YOU DO IT.

05:06.567 --> 05:09.167
SO, UM...
UM, DR. BAILEY?

05:09.200 --> 05:10.533
SURGEONS DON'T SAY "UM,"
O'MALLEY.

05:10.567 --> 05:12.433
YOU WANT TO BE A SURGEON,
LEARN TO SPEAK LIKE ONE.

05:12.467 --> 05:14.500
LOOK, HE WANTS YOU TO TALK
TO THE CHIEF ABOUT IZZIE,

05:14.533 --> 05:16.433
SEE IF SHE CAN
COME BACK.
SHE'S JUST BAKING--

05:16.467 --> 05:18.367
A LOT OF BAKING--
AND IT SEEMS A WASTE

05:18.400 --> 05:20.533
FOR ALL HER TALENT
AND MEDICAL SKILLS

05:20.567 --> 05:21.867
TO GO INTO MUFFINS.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.100
WE JUST THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE WILLING TO HELP.
STOP... TALKING.

05:26.867 --> 05:29.533
YES, MA'AM.

05:29.567 --> 05:30.833
WELL, GOOD MORNING.
BENJAMIN, RUTH.

05:30.867 --> 05:33.500
GOOD MORNING,
DR. SHEPHERD.
GOOD MORNING.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.833
IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
A VERY GOOD MORNING TO ME.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.200
I HAVE TO HAVE BRAIN SURGERY
TODAY. PRETTY SCARY.

05:38.233 --> 05:39.567
PLUS, MY SISTER IS NERVOUS.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.067
WHEN SHE GETS NERVOUS,
SHE SWEATS,

05:42.067 --> 05:44.267
AND THE WINDOWS IN HERE
DON'T OPEN, SO IT'S PRETTY RANK.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.433
BENJAMIN.
WAS I RUDE, RUTHIE?

05:46.467 --> 05:48.200
LET'S LET THE DOCTORS TALK.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.800
BENJAMIN O'LEARY, 32,
IN FOR THE REMOVAL

05:49.833 --> 05:52.633
OF A BRAIN TUMOR THAT'S PRESSING
ON HIS FRONTAL TEMPORAL LOBE.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
CLEARLY, IT'S AFFECTING
HIS IMPULSE CONTROL.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.333
IT MAKES ME SAY EVERYTHING
I THINK,

05:56.367 --> 05:57.600
WHICH APPARENTLY
IS ANNOYING.

05:57.633 --> 05:59.300
THIS DOCTOR LOOKS ANNOYED,
ANYWAY.

05:59.333 --> 06:02.100
ALTHOUGH, IT'S HARD TO TELL
'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS HAS

06:02.133 --> 06:04.400
KIND OF A PINCHED,
UPTIGHT LOOK ON HER FACE.
(George snickers)

06:04.433 --> 06:06.333
AM I ANNOYING YOU?
IT'S FINE.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.833
(Ruth)
YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S FINE.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.367
HE DOESN'T PERCEIVE SARCASM
OR IRONY.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.667
IF HE'S ANNOYING YOU,
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.700
MAYBE I'M NOT ANNOYING HER,
RUTHIE.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.533
NO, YOU ARE.
(Miranda) DR. YANG.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.600
HE ASKED.
OKAY, BENJAMIN, DR. YANG--
PINCHED AND ANNOYED

06:17.633 --> 06:20.400
THOUGH SHE MAY BE--IS GONNA
PREP YOU FOR SURGERY TODAY.

06:20.433 --> 06:23.233
DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS FOR ME?
IS THAT BLONDE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

06:23.267 --> 06:25.167
'CAUSE THE WAY YOU KEEP
LOOKING AT HER,

06:25.200 --> 06:28.167
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST MOUNT HER
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.200
I'M SORRY.
WAS THAT RUDE?

06:31.833 --> 06:34.667
I'M PROUD OF YOU ALL.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.200
YOU MAKE ME PROUD.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.567
YOU REFLECT ON ME WELL.

06:38.600 --> 06:41.500
GREY, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
KEEP YOUR CLOTHES ON

06:41.533 --> 06:44.067
LONG ENOUGH TO FOLLOW UP
THE LABS, I'D APPRECIATE IT.

06:44.100 --> 06:45.433
KAREV, COVER THE PIT.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.367
WAIT, THE PIT?
I'M--I'M OFF GYNIE?

06:47.400 --> 06:49.300
DR. MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD
IS OUT SICK.

06:49.333 --> 06:53.400
YOU CAN COVER THE PIT,
OR YOU CAN...

06:53.433 --> 06:55.067
YOU CAN TELL ME

06:55.100 --> 06:57.367
WHOSE DAMN PANTIES

06:57.400 --> 07:00.500
ARE ON THE BULLETIN BOARD!

07:00.533 --> 07:01.700
(Cristina whispers) YOURS?
(man whistles)

07:01.733 --> 07:04.067
THIS IS A HOSPITAL, PEOPLE.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.767
SERIOUS WORK HAPPENS HERE.

07:05.800 --> 07:08.333
WE SAVE LIVES HE--

07:08.367 --> 07:10.633
(George and Alex laugh)
OH, SOMETHING FUNNY?
WHOSE ARE THESE?

07:10.667 --> 07:12.400
(nurses snickering, laughing)

07:12.433 --> 07:14.833
THIS IS BAD.
THIS ISN'T GOOD.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.133
WELL, YOU BETTER
CLAIM THEM.
(George snorts)

07:17.167 --> 07:19.633
SHE THINKS THEY'RE MINE.
CLAIM THEM!
NO!

07:19.667 --> 07:22.133
YEAH, I KNOW IT'S ONE OF YOU.
IT'S ALWAYS ONE OF MINE.

07:22.167 --> 07:23.733
ALWAYS.

07:23.767 --> 07:26.433
SO TELL ME, WHICH ONE OF YOU
LEFT YOUR DAMN DRAWERS

07:26.467 --> 07:30.067
ON MY SURGICAL FLOOR!

07:33.300 --> 07:36.167
OH, NO. DID I LEAVE
MY UNDERWEAR LYING AROUND AGAIN?

07:36.200 --> 07:39.200
I AM SO SORRY, BAILEY.
IT'S, UH,

07:39.233 --> 07:41.467
IT'S MY BAD.

07:54.667 --> 07:57.133
O'MALLEY, YANG,
PREP YOUR PATIENT FOR SURGERY.

07:57.167 --> 07:58.500
KAREV, PIT. GREY, CHARTS.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.400
ALL FOUR OF YOU,
DO NOT MAKE ME REGRET

08:00.433 --> 08:04.067
SETTING YOU LOOSE
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.500
O'MALLEY, WHAT DO I MEAN
BY THAT?

08:06.533 --> 08:08.533
YOU MEAN CHECK WITH YOU
BEFORE WE CUT ANY WIRES

08:08.567 --> 08:10.500
OR STEAL ANY HEARTS.
ARE YOU TRYING
TO BE CLEVER?

08:10.533 --> 08:12.400
NO, MA'AM.
BETTER NOT BE.

08:14.133 --> 08:16.300
HOLY CRAP.
THE NAZI'S DEFINITELY BACK.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.667
AND LOUDER THAN EVER.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.733
OH, MRS. BURKE.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.400
HI, I'M CRISTINA.

08:21.433 --> 08:23.767
I-I MAY HAVE SAID THAT
EARLIER, BUT I WAS, UM--

08:23.800 --> 08:25.700
DID I HEAR YOU REFER
TO MIRANDA BAILEY

08:25.733 --> 08:27.333
AS A NAZI?

08:27.367 --> 08:29.200
WHAT? OH, NO.

08:29.233 --> 08:31.167
OH, UH, UH, I MEAN, YES,
BUT--

08:31.200 --> 08:33.100
YOU DO UNDERSTAND THAT
THE NAZIS WERE RESPONSIBLE

08:33.133 --> 08:36.067
FOR THE WORST GENOCIDE
IN THE HISTORY OF MAN?

08:36.067 --> 08:38.633
AND A RACIST GENOCIDE
AT THAT.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.533
I WOULD THINK
THAT AS A WOMAN OF COLOR

08:40.567 --> 08:43.433
AND AS A DOCTOR, NO LESS,
THAT YOU WOULD THINK TWICE

08:43.467 --> 08:45.533
BEFORE USING THAT WORD
AS A PUNCH LINE.

08:45.567 --> 08:49.067
I'LL THINK ABOUT THAT
IN THE FUTURE, MRS. BURKE.

08:49.067 --> 08:51.500
MRS. BURKE? PRESTON'S MOTHER?
YES.

08:51.533 --> 08:53.267
OH.
AND YOU ARE?

08:53.300 --> 08:54.500
DEREK SHEPHERD.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.267
I'M THE SURGEON
WHO OPERATED ON YOUR SON.
OH, THANK YOU.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.167
BRILLIANT SURGEON.
AND A HANDSOME MAN, TOO.

08:58.200 --> 09:00.133
YOUR MOTHER MUST BE
VERY PROUD.

09:00.167 --> 09:03.700
DO YOU MIND, DR. SHEPHERD,
IF I BORROW YOUR YOUNG INTERN

09:03.733 --> 09:06.267
FOR A QUICK CUP OF COFFEE?
I'LL BRING HER RIGHT BACK.
OH, NO PROBLEM.

09:06.300 --> 09:08.800
DR. GREY CAN COVER
FOR CRISTINA.

09:08.833 --> 09:10.633
I'M SORRY?

09:10.667 --> 09:12.800
UH, DR. GREY IS VERY BUSY.
SHE HAS CHARTS TO DO FOR BAILEY.

09:12.833 --> 09:14.333
BAILEY'S ON THE WARPATH.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.633
UH, NOT THE GERMAN WARPATH.
IT'S A HOSPITAL WARPATH.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.467
IT'S--IT'S--
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF BAILEY, OKAY?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.833
ENJOY YOUR COFFEE DATE, LADIES.
VERY NICE MEETING YOU.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.833
THANK YOU.

09:23.867 --> 09:26.267
I'LL, UM...

09:27.633 --> 09:30.067
I JUST HAVE THIS ONE QUICK--

09:30.100 --> 09:32.800
I WILL MEET YOU IN THE CAFETERIA
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.533
IS THAT--IS THAT ALL RIGHT?
YES, I LOOK FORWARD
TO IT.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.200
OH, GOOD.

09:41.167 --> 09:44.067
WELL, THIS IS A CHANGE
FROM THE ELEVATOR, I MEAN.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.167
A LITTLE MORE PUBLIC.
I LIKE IT.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.767
YOU'RE MARRIED.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.067
YOU'RE MARRIED,
AND YOU SAID THINGS TO ME.

09:50.067 --> 09:52.667
YES, I SAID THINGS
TO YOU.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.600
NORMALLY, I WOULD LIKE
THE THINGS YOU SAID TO ME.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.600
NORMALLY, I WOULD EVEN THINK
THE BULLETIN BOARD THING

09:56.633 --> 09:58.500
WAS FUNNY.
BULLETIN BOARD?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:58.533 --> 10:00.700
BUT YOU'RE MARRIED, WHICH MAKES
NONE OF THIS NORMAL.

10:00.733 --> 10:02.233
IT MAKES ME A HOME WRECKER.

10:02.267 --> 10:04.200
AND I HATE THE FACT
THAT I'M A HOME WRECKER.

10:04.233 --> 10:07.133
MEREDITH, I'M NOT
GONNA PRESSURE YOU.

10:07.167 --> 10:08.767
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.700
BUT JUST SO YOU HAVE
ALL THE INFORMATION,

10:10.733 --> 10:13.267
MY HOME WAS WRECKED WELL BEFORE
YOU CAME INTO THE PICTURE,

10:13.300 --> 10:16.433
AND I AM JUST NOW DONE
TRYING TO REBUILD IT.
YOU'RE DONE?

10:16.467 --> 10:17.633
I'M DONE.

10:17.667 --> 10:21.667
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, I AM
ENDING IT WITH ADDISON... TODAY.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.733
YOU HAVE SAID THIS BEFORE.

10:24.767 --> 10:26.667
I KNOW,
BUT THIS TIME I MEAN IT.

10:26.700 --> 10:30.333
I'M GONNA COME CLEAN
JUST AS SOON AS I SEE HER.

10:30.367 --> 10:31.767
YOU ARE?

10:31.800 --> 10:33.733
I AM.

10:48.567 --> 10:51.200
YOU GUYS SHOULD THINK ABOUT
GETTING A HOTEL ROOM

10:51.233 --> 10:53.033
OR SOMETHING.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.233
OH.

10:57.267 --> 10:59.200
UM...

11:03.067 --> 11:05.067
(clears throat)

11:08.267 --> 11:10.333
YOUR MOTHER WANTS TO HAVE
COFFEE WITH ME.

11:10.367 --> 11:11.267
AND?

11:11.300 --> 11:13.800
AND... SHE THINKS
I'M A RACIST.

11:13.833 --> 11:14.833
OH, AND A STRIPPER.

11:14.867 --> 11:18.067
HMM. SHE THINKS
I'M A RACIST STRIPPER.
(chuckles)

11:18.100 --> 11:21.633
OH, COME ON. WHAT'S FUNNY?
THIS IS NOT FUNNY.
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

11:21.667 --> 11:23.667
SHE'S JUST MY MAMA,
CRISTINA.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.833
YOUR "MAMA"?

11:25.867 --> 11:27.633
YOU'LL LOVE HER
WHEN YOU GET TO KNOW HER.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.567
EVERYBODY LOVES MY MAMA.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.133
YOU WILL SAVE ME
FROM THIS, OKAY?

11:32.167 --> 11:35.067
YOU WILL SAVE ME
FROM THIS OR...

11:40.067 --> 11:42.133
(under breath)
YOU WILL SAVE ME.

11:46.633 --> 11:49.400
(sighs)

11:49.433 --> 11:51.433
(laughs)
(laughs)

11:51.467 --> 11:53.733
HEY, UH, CHIEF, YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM ADDISON, HAVE YOU?

11:53.767 --> 11:55.267
SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
ANY PHONES.

11:55.300 --> 11:58.067
ACTUALLY,
SHE NEEDED A DAY OFF.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.833
SOMETHING ABOUT FINDING
ANOTHER WOMAN'S PANTIES

11:59.867 --> 12:01.800
IN THE POCKET OF YOUR TUX.

12:01.833 --> 12:03.167
OH, THAT'S--

12:03.200 --> 12:05.100
THAT'S NOT HOW I WANTED HER
TO FIND OUT.

12:05.133 --> 12:07.700
YOU DON'T LEAVE
ANOTHER WOMAN'S PANTIES

12:07.733 --> 12:10.633
IN YOUR TUX UNLESS
YOU WANT HER TO FIND 'EM.
I KNOW, I KNOW.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.467
LOOK, I KNOW A THING OR TWO
ABOUT AFFAIRS.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.500
I EVEN KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT
AFFAIRS WITH WOMEN NAMED GREY.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.400
IT'S NOT AN AFFAIR.
SEE, I WAS GONNA TELL HER.

12:17.433 --> 12:20.300
ADDISON--I WAS GONNA TELL HER
TODAY. I WAS GONNA END IT.

12:20.333 --> 12:21.833
LOOK, GIVE HER SOME SPACE.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.200
NO.
GIVE HER SOME TIME.

12:23.233 --> 12:25.367
NO. THAT'S NOT IT. NO.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.633
NO, I GOTTA--
I GOTTA TALK TO HER TODAY.

12:27.667 --> 12:29.567
IF SOMETHING'S OVER,
IT'S JUST GOTTA BE OVER.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.200
MEREDITH, SHE'S--

12:31.233 --> 12:33.567
SHE'S NOT AN AFFAIR.

12:35.833 --> 12:36.700
OW!

12:36.733 --> 12:39.467
RUTHIE, I DON'T THINK
I WANT THIS SURGERY.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.167
YOU HAVE TO HAVE
THE SURGERY, BEN.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.167
RIGHT.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.200
YOU'RE VERY PRETTY,
BUT YOU LOOK KINDA TIRED,

12:47.233 --> 12:49.700
AND I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CHANGE YOUR HAIR CONDITIONER.

12:49.733 --> 12:52.300
THAT WAS RUDE, BENJAMIN.
IT IS?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.767
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S TRUE,
AND IT'S REFRESHING.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.633
DO YOU HAVE SEX
WITH THAT BRAIN SURGEON?

12:56.667 --> 12:57.833
(Ruth) BENJAMIN.

12:57.867 --> 13:00.467
IT'S OKAY.
NOPE, I HAVEN'T.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.400
NOT TODAY, ANYWAY.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.733
I WOULD. HE'S HOT...

13:03.767 --> 13:06.267
AND ARROGANT IN A WAY
THAT'S STILL SEXY.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.200
I WOULD TOTALLY HAVE SEX
WITH HIM IF I COULD.

13:08.233 --> 13:09.733
LOOKED LIKE YOU COULD.

13:09.767 --> 13:11.467
SO WHAT'S THE HOLDUP?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.533
OH, EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.767
(laughs) ARE YOU TRYING
TO SEDUCE ME?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.267
I WAS JUST WONDERING--'CAUSE I
GOT A LOT OF WORK TO DO--
MM-HMM.

13:25.300 --> 13:27.333
BUT, UH, I WAS JUST WONDERING
ABOUT, UH, THE PANTIES--

13:27.367 --> 13:28.700
THE PANTIES THAT ARE YOURS--

13:28.733 --> 13:31.133
AND HOW THEY ENDED UP
ON THE BULLETIN BOARD.

13:31.167 --> 13:33.300
BLACK, LACY PANTIES
ON THE BOARD.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.767
YOU ARE TRYING
TO SEDUCE ME.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.233
(clears throat)
NO. NO, I'M NOT.

13:38.267 --> 13:39.600
I'M JUST WONDERING HOW, UH,

13:39.633 --> 13:41.200
PANTIES THAT
I HAVEN'T SEEN BEFORE--

13:41.233 --> 13:43.567
AND I'VE SEEN YOUR PANTIES
A LOT OF DAYS IN A ROW NOW--

13:43.600 --> 13:45.733
I'M JUST WONDERING
HOW BLACK PANTIES

13:45.767 --> 13:48.300
THAT APPARENTLY BELONG TO YOU
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN

13:48.333 --> 13:51.100
END UP ON THE BULLETIN BOARD.
WOW. YOU'RE JEALOUS.

13:51.133 --> 13:52.567
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YEAH.

13:52.600 --> 13:53.400
NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT--

13:53.433 --> 13:55.333
YEAH. YEAH, YOU ARE.
(woman screams)

13:55.367 --> 13:57.100
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.067
NO, I'M--

13:59.067 --> 14:01.267
IS THAT MY PAT--

14:01.300 --> 14:02.633
MS. SEABURY?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.067
MS. SEABURY?

14:04.067 --> 14:05.600
HEY. STOP. GET...

14:05.633 --> 14:07.800
I'LL TELL HIM.
WHAT?

14:07.833 --> 14:10.333
I'LL TELL HIM THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE PANTIES.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.767
DON'T YOU DARE.
HE IS JEALOUS.

14:14.633 --> 14:16.133
SO YOU AND O'MALLEY, HUH?

14:16.167 --> 14:17.500
(chuckles)
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

14:17.533 --> 14:19.433
I DON'T KNOW. YOU'RE A SURGEON.
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.200
KAREV, SHE'S A RESIDENT.
SHE OUTRANKS YOU.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.133
YOU DON'T GET TO ASK
PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

14:23.167 --> 14:24.567
IT'S FINE, DR. BAILEY.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.533
HE'S MY INTERN.
I SAY IT'S NOT FINE.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.600
ARE WE CLEAR?
NO.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.500
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR?

14:30.533 --> 14:32.633
WHAT'S NOT CLEAR TO ME IS WHY
YOU WON'T TALK TO IZZIE.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.367
THAT'S WHAT'S NOT CLEAR.
REALLY?

14:34.400 --> 14:35.567
YOU WANT TO PUSH ME
ON THIS TODAY?

14:35.600 --> 14:38.200
TODAY YOU WANT TO PUSH ME?

14:38.233 --> 14:39.567
WHAT DO WE GOT, JILL?

14:39.600 --> 14:42.067
HARLEY HERNANDEZ, 14,
WAS STREET LUGING

14:42.067 --> 14:43.800
WHEN HE LOST CONTROL
AND HIT A CAR.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.400
WITNESSES SAY
HE WAS CATAPULTED

14:45.433 --> 14:47.333
AT LEAST 20 FEET
INTO THE AIR,

14:47.367 --> 14:49.233
LANDED ON A PILE
OF TREE TRIMMINGS.

14:49.267 --> 14:51.533
BROKEN PELVIS IS APPARENT
AS ARE, I WOULD GUESS,

14:51.567 --> 14:54.533
SOME PRETTY MASSIVE
INTERNAL INJURIES.
YOU WOULD GUESS?

15:06.067 --> 15:07.500
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HARLEY.
YOU'RE AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:07.533 --> 15:09.233
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOU NOW, OKAY?

15:09.267 --> 15:10.667
HOSPITAL? WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ME?

15:10.700 --> 15:12.200
YOU'RE AN IDIOT.
THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER.
DAD.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.067
SIR.
SIR, PLEASE BACK AWAY.
YOUR FRIENDS ARE IDIOTS,

15:14.100 --> 15:16.167
AND YOU DON'T USE
THE SENSE GOD GAVE YOU!

15:16.200 --> 15:20.433
THAT'S WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU!
(Jill) SIR, YOU'RE BLOCKING
OUR PATH. PLEASE!

15:20.467 --> 15:21.600
(Alex) YOU OKAY?
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
OW!

15:21.633 --> 15:22.433
SIR, SIR.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.333
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
WHERE'S MY SON?

15:24.367 --> 15:26.233
WE TOOK HIM IN THERE.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.133
HE WAS BLOCKING
THE PARAMEDICS.

15:30.167 --> 15:33.400
NO, HE IS TERRIFIED.
HIS CHILD IS A TREE!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.133
ALEX, LISTEN TO ME.
YOU WILL NOT GET PHYSICAL

15:35.167 --> 15:37.533
WITH ANOTHER HUMAN BEING
ON MY WATCH EVER AGAIN,

15:37.567 --> 15:39.167
YOU WILL NOT QUESTION
MY AUTHORITY,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.100
AND YOU WILL NOT DEFEND
YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND

15:41.133 --> 15:44.067
FOR KILLING A MAN!
ARE WE CLEAR?!
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.700
AS YOU KNOW, I'M SURE,

15:48.733 --> 15:50.533
HE GRADUATED FIRST
IN HIS CLASS FROM TULANE.

15:50.567 --> 15:53.067
I-I DID KNOW THAT.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.467
ACTUALLY, I GRADUATED FIRST
IN MY CLASS AT STANFORD.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.067
AHH.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.833
SO YOU ARE PLANNING
TO PURSUE

15:58.867 --> 16:00.567
A LESS TIME-CONSUMING
SPECIALTY--

16:00.600 --> 16:03.433
OBSTETRICS, PERHAPS,
OR FAMILY MEDICINE?

16:03.467 --> 16:05.633
OH, I'M IN
THE SURGICAL PROGRAM.

16:05.667 --> 16:08.533
BUT AFTER YOU'RE MARRIED.
MARRIED?

16:08.567 --> 16:10.233
UH, I'M SORRY. MARRIED?

16:10.267 --> 16:12.667
COME, CRISTINA. YOU MUST HAVE
CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.300
YOU'RE NO SPRING CHICKEN.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.200
I DON'T KNOW A YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WOULDN'T WANT

16:16.233 --> 16:18.133
TO MARRY MY PRESTON
GIVEN HALF THE CHANCE.

16:18.167 --> 16:21.133
HE'S HANDSOME.
HE'S BRILLIANT.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.733
HE IS THE BEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

16:23.767 --> 16:26.533
HE IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.400
OH. OKAY.

16:29.433 --> 16:30.633
OH, BURKE. BURKE.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.667
BURKE'S HERE. PRESTON IS--
PRESTON BURKE IS HERE.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.333
OH, WHAT A SURPRISE.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.400
MY TWO FAVORITE LADIES
ALL IN ONE PLACE.

16:36.433 --> 16:38.500
PRESTON, WHAT ON EARTH
ARE YOU DOING OUT OF BED?

16:38.533 --> 16:40.300
OH...

16:40.333 --> 16:42.067
WELL, I...

16:42.067 --> 16:44.767
I WANTED TO GET SOME, UH,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.767
I--
STRETCH MY LEGS, MAMA.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.700
BUT YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO STRETCH YOUR LEGS.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.833
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE RESTING.

16:50.867 --> 16:52.600
RIGHT.

16:52.633 --> 16:54.600
BUT I WANTED TO HAVE, UH,

16:54.633 --> 16:56.367
SOME AIR...
(mouths words)

16:56.400 --> 16:58.667
SOME STRETCHING, SOME AIR
AND SOME COFFEE.

16:58.700 --> 17:00.233
ANYBODY WANT ANY COFFEE?

17:00.267 --> 17:02.433
WE ALREADY HAVE COFFEE.

17:02.467 --> 17:04.767
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.
RIGHT.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.133
JUST A SECOND.

17:07.167 --> 17:09.233
YOU DID THIS.
DID WHAT?

17:09.267 --> 17:11.100
CRISTINA, LISTEN TO ME.

17:11.133 --> 17:13.067
IT'S NOT
THAT I DON'T LIKE YOU.

17:13.067 --> 17:15.767
I THINK YOU'RE A VERY SMART,
VERY ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.433
BUT YOU'RE SELFISH.
I BEG YOUR PARDON.

17:18.467 --> 17:20.467
OH, YOU PULLED HIM
OUT OF A SICKBED

17:20.500 --> 17:22.167
BECAUSE YOU WERE
UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:22.200 --> 17:24.200
THAT'S SELFISH.

17:24.233 --> 17:26.100
YOU'RE SELFISH
AND MY SON IS GIVING.

17:26.133 --> 17:30.333
AND THE COMBINATION,
WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA LAST,

17:30.367 --> 17:32.767
NOT MUCH LONGER.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.467
(Preston chuckles)

17:34.500 --> 17:36.600
HEY, HEY, HI. ALL RIGHT.

17:36.633 --> 17:40.533
ALL RIGHT.
I BROUGHT YOU A SCONE, MAMA.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.500
(Miranda) HIS KIDNEY'S GONE.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.367
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE IT.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.800
(Richard) JUST FOCUS ON KEEPING
THE RENAL ARTERY UNDER CONTROL.

17:50.833 --> 17:53.067
I HAVE ANOTHER BLEEDER.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.667
OKAY, PACE YOURSELF, EVERYBODY.
WE GOT LONG WAY TO GO.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.633
WE HAVE ENOUGH BLOOD
STANDING BY?

17:59.100 --> 18:00.567
IS THAT A TREE?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.667
HIS MOTHER RIVALS MY MOTHER,
AND THAT IS SAYING SOMETHING.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.667
THEY'RE OPERATING AROUND IT?
BOTH OF THEM,
DARK AND EVIL.

18:06.700 --> 18:09.233
YOU'RE BLOCKING MY VIEW,
GEORGE.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.267
I MISS DIRTY STRIPPER CRISTINA.
SHE WAS FUN...

18:11.300 --> 18:12.800
A LOT LESS ANGRY.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.133
NEXT TIME I SEE HER, IF SHE
EVEN LOOKS AT MY SIDEWAYS,

18:15.167 --> 18:17.067
I'M TELLING HER
WHAT I THINK.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.133
SHE WANTS TO CALL ME RACIST?
WH--

18:19.167 --> 18:20.833
YEAH. OKAY?
I'LL CALL HER SEXIST.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.633
CHANGE MY CAREER
AFTER I'M MARRIED?

18:23.667 --> 18:25.367
WHAT IS THIS, 1953?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.533
IF SHE COMES AT ME,
I'M GOIN' THERE.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.233
I THINK YOU SHOULD.
MM-HMM.

18:29.267 --> 18:31.167
I THINK WE ALL
SHOULD JUST GO THERE.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.767
YOU KNOW, TELL THE TRUTH,
SPIT IT OUT,

18:33.800 --> 18:36.667
GO WITH YOUR GUT,
FOLLOW YOUR INSTINCTS.

18:36.700 --> 18:39.200
I MISS PHILANDERING
WHORE MEREDITH.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.167
SHE WAS TRASHY
AND MUCH LESS IDYLLIC.

18:41.200 --> 18:44.600
DO WOMEN HAVE TWO SETS
OF PANTIES?

18:44.633 --> 18:47.833
YOU KNOW, TWO SETS THEY WEAR
FOR DIFFERENT OCCASIONS?

18:47.867 --> 18:49.600
I MADE A CHOICE.
I'M PICKING DEREK.

18:49.633 --> 18:51.267
FINN IS GREAT.

18:51.300 --> 18:53.567
BUT DEREK IS... DEREK.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.367
AND... I'M FOLLOWING MY GUT.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.833
YEAH, WHATEVER.
I-I WANT MY PATIENT BACK.

18:58.867 --> 19:01.067
YOU KNOW, THE ONE YOU STOLE
AFTER... (scoffs)

19:01.100 --> 19:02.733
MAMA CORNERED ME?

19:02.767 --> 19:05.733
WELL, THAT'S FINE. IT'S MY DAY
TO CHECK ON IZZIE ANYWAY.

19:05.767 --> 19:07.600
YOU PAGED ME?

19:07.633 --> 19:10.833
YOUR PATIENT WAS CAUGHT
SHOPLIFTING CHOCOLATES

19:10.867 --> 19:14.167
FROM THE HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP.
WHAT?

19:14.200 --> 19:16.133
I'D NEVER DONE THAT BEFORE.
IT WAS EXHILARATING.

19:16.167 --> 19:18.267
AND NOW SHE'S PLANNING
TO LEAVE.
LEAVE? YOU CAN'T LE--

19:18.300 --> 19:20.467
SHE CAN'T LEAVE.
YOU'RE SICK.

19:20.500 --> 19:23.133
YOU SHOULD BE SLEEPING
AND RESTING.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.633
AND PREPARING FOR DEATH?

19:24.667 --> 19:26.567
PREPARING FOR SURGERY.
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE.
MAYBE.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.567
MAYBE NOT.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.500
THAT'S WHAT THEY MEAN
WHEN THEY GIVE YOU

19:30.533 --> 19:31.700
A 60% CHANCE OF SURVIVAL.

19:31.733 --> 19:33.700
IT MEANS THAT 4 OUT OF 10
PEOPLE DIE

19:33.733 --> 19:36.133
WHETHER THEY HAVE
THE SURGERY OR NOT.

19:36.167 --> 19:38.567
I HAVE LIVED MY ENTIRE LIFE
PENT-UP, REPRESSED,

19:38.600 --> 19:40.600
STIFLING EVERY IMPULSE,
FOLLOWING EVERY RULE,

19:40.633 --> 19:42.833
AND NOW I'M DONE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:42.867 --> 19:45.733
YOU SHOULD BE, TOO.
WE SHOULD ALL BE DONE.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.367
SO YOU'RE LEAVING?
I'M CLAIMING MY LIFE,
DOCTOR.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.500
I CAN'T DO THAT
FROM A HOSPITAL BED.

19:49.533 --> 19:52.500
AND YOU KNOW YOU'LL DIE.
MAYBE.

19:52.533 --> 19:56.533
BUT AT LEAST WHEN I DO,
I'LL KNOW THAT I HAVE LIVED.

19:56.567 --> 19:58.633
(muffled)
OH, GOD, THIS IS GOOD.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.767
IZZIE?

20:04.233 --> 20:06.467
(Meredith) WOW.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.700
OKAY.

20:10.733 --> 20:12.700
(doorbell rings)

20:14.767 --> 20:15.700
FINN.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.333
HI. WH-WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

20:18.367 --> 20:19.533
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING.

20:19.567 --> 20:21.467
I AM. I'M--I WAS.
I-I STILL AM.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.067
I JUST CAME HOME
TO CHECK ON IZZIE.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.500
OH, SO DID I.

20:26.533 --> 20:29.067
I BROUGHT HER LUNCH.

20:29.100 --> 20:30.833
YOU BROUGHT IZZIE LUNCH.

20:30.867 --> 20:32.767
WHEN MY WIFE DIED,
UH...

20:32.800 --> 20:34.700
THERE REALLY WASN'T ANYTHING
ANYONE COULD SAY,

20:34.733 --> 20:36.800
BUT, UH...

20:36.833 --> 20:39.033
THE BRINGING OF FOOD
ACTUALLY HELPED.

20:39.067 --> 20:41.700
IT WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT HELPED.

20:41.733 --> 20:43.333
YOU BROUGHT IZZIE FOOD.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.467
YEAH.
EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T THINK
I WAS HERE.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.467
IS--IS THAT OKAY?

20:47.500 --> 20:49.833
YEAH.

20:49.867 --> 20:52.233
IT'S AMAZING, ACTUALLY.

20:52.267 --> 20:54.367
YOU'RE AMAZING...
SWEET AND THOUGHTFUL

20:54.400 --> 20:56.067
AND SENSITIVE.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.567
MEREDITH, I DON'T WANT
TO PRESSURE YOU.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.500
YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE,

21:00.533 --> 21:03.300
AND I WANT YOU TO TAKE
ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

21:03.333 --> 21:05.667
BUT I DO WANT TO MAKE
ONE THING CLEAR.
WHAT'S THAT?

21:05.700 --> 21:09.367
I'M NOT ALL THAT SENSITIVE.

21:21.733 --> 21:23.633
SO...

21:23.667 --> 21:25.667
SO...

21:27.600 --> 21:30.233
HAVE A NICE DAY
AT WORK.

21:46.167 --> 21:48.567
MR. HERNANDEZ.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.500
H-HOW IS HE? IS HE OKAY?

21:50.533 --> 21:52.433
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN OPERATING
FOR HOURS.

21:52.467 --> 21:53.633
THERE IS EXTENSIVE DAMAGE.

21:53.667 --> 21:55.567
WE'VE HAD TO REMOVE
ONE OF HIS KIDNEYS

21:55.600 --> 21:57.267
AND A PORTION OF HIS BOWEL.

21:57.300 --> 21:59.200
BUT THE TREE'S OUT.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.233
I MEAN, YOU GOT IT OUT,
AND HE'S OKAY.
OKAY, MR. HERNANDEZ,

22:01.267 --> 22:03.067
THE BRANCH ACTUALLY
IS STILL THERE.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.400
WE'RE OPERATING AROUND IT,

22:04.433 --> 22:06.333
WHICH IS PART OF
WHAT'S TAKING SO MUCH TIME.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.267
HIS MOTHER'S NOT HERE YET.
I MEAN... YOU THINK--

22:08.300 --> 22:11.200
YOU THINK HE'LL BE OKAY
BY THE TIME SHE GETS HERE?

22:11.233 --> 22:13.367
I-I'M SORRY, I DO HAVE TO
GET BACK IN THERE.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.833
BUT I JUST WANTED
TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.367
THAT HE'S STILL ALIVE.

22:16.400 --> 22:18.600
YES, THAT HE'S STILL ALIVE.

22:18.633 --> 22:20.333
OKAY.

22:20.367 --> 22:22.233
OKAY.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.800
IZZIE. HOW YOU DOIN',
SWEETIE?

22:31.300 --> 22:33.567
I BROUGHT YOU SOME MUFFINS.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.533
OKAY.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.467
I MADE A LOT,
AND I WAS...

22:37.500 --> 22:38.667
RUNNING OUT OF ROOM,

22:38.700 --> 22:41.600
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE...
YOU WOULD LIKE SOME.

22:41.633 --> 22:43.700
I'M A GOOD BAKER.

22:43.733 --> 22:46.400
YEAH. ABSOLUTELY.
THANK YOU.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.267
DR. STEVENS.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.800
PLEASE DON'T CALL ME
"DOCTOR."

22:51.833 --> 22:52.833
OKAY...

22:52.867 --> 22:54.767
PLEASE DON'T CALL ME
"MRS. SHEPHERD."

22:54.800 --> 22:58.633
HA! THAT'S FUNNY.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.467
SHE'S DRUNK.
(Joe) THIS IS TRUE.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.367
SO DID YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE SLUTTY SEX

23:02.400 --> 23:07.067
YOUR SLUTTY FRIEND HAD WITH
MY... SUPER SLUTTY HUSBAND?

23:07.100 --> 23:09.267
YOU SHOULD HAVE A MUFFIN.

23:09.300 --> 23:12.833
THEY'RE REALLY GOOD,
AND... THEY'LL HELP YOU.

23:12.867 --> 23:15.667
I MAY BE BEYOND HELP.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.167
YEAH.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.733
ME, TOO.

23:18.767 --> 23:21.433
DON'T LET HER DRIVE, JOE.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.733
(Addison) MMM.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.333
(muffled) GOOD.

23:25.367 --> 23:26.533
(Mrs. Burke laughs)

23:26.567 --> 23:29.300
BUT I KNEW.
I KNEW THAT YOU...

23:29.333 --> 23:30.567
(Preston and Mrs. Burke laugh)

23:30.600 --> 23:32.233
SHE'S STILL HERE.

23:32.267 --> 23:33.833
NEVER LEAVES.

23:33.867 --> 23:36.067
SHE NEVER EVEN PEES.

23:36.100 --> 23:37.833
I'M NOT ENTIRELY SURE
SHE'S HUMAN.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.733
(sighs)

23:39.767 --> 23:41.667
FINN BROUGHT IZZIE LUNCH.

23:41.700 --> 23:44.133
OH, YOU WENT TO SEE IZZIE?
YEAH, SHE WASN'T HOME.

23:44.167 --> 23:45.767
BUT I'M TAKING THAT
AS A GOOD THING,

23:45.800 --> 23:47.700
'CAUSE AT LEAST THE BAKING
HAS STOPPED.

23:47.733 --> 23:49.800
BUT MY POINT IS THAT FINN
BROUGHT IZZIE LUNCH.

23:49.833 --> 23:51.333
HE'S THAT GUY--

23:51.367 --> 23:53.500
THE GUY WHO BRINGS YOUR ROOMMATE
LUNCH WHEN SHE'S SAD.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.100
MM. SO, UH,
YOU DIDN'T END IT?

23:56.133 --> 23:57.133
HE'S THE GUY

23:57.167 --> 23:59.233
WHO BRINGS YOUR ROOMMATE LUNCH
WHEN SHE'S SAD.

23:59.267 --> 24:00.767
SO I'M GONNA END IT
WITH DEREK.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.700
MM-HMM. WHATEVER.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.700
YOU KNOW, I AM NOT SELFISH.
I AM BY HIS SIDE.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.500
I-I TOOK OFF ALL MY CLOTHES
THIS MORNING.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.067
THAT'S NOT SELFISH.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.833
AND I'M GOING IN FOR SURGERY.

24:10.867 --> 24:13.333
SELFISH PEOPLE
DON'T SAVE LIVES.

24:16.200 --> 24:19.767
(Meredith) GEORGE.

24:19.800 --> 24:20.733
WHAT?

24:20.767 --> 24:22.767
YOU'RE FLIRTING
WITH THAT NURSE.

24:22.800 --> 24:24.733
I'M YOUNG. I'M HEALTHY.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.667
I GOT A LIFE TO LIVE.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.600
IS THIS ABOUT THE PANTIES?

24:28.633 --> 24:31.333
ARE YOU STILL JEALOUS?
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

24:31.367 --> 24:32.700
I'M JUST LIVING MY LIFE.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.333
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

24:37.367 --> 24:38.667
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

24:38.700 --> 24:40.133
DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

24:40.167 --> 24:42.133
HE'S GONNA KEEP ASKING
TILL YOU ANSWER.

24:42.167 --> 24:44.400
YES, I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.
CAN YOU LOOK HERE?

24:44.433 --> 24:46.067
IF I HAD A BOYFRIEND,

24:46.100 --> 24:47.833
I WOULD DEFINITELY NOT BE
AS ANGRY AS YOU.
MM-HMM.

24:47.867 --> 24:50.600
WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY?
IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE FRIGID?

24:50.633 --> 24:52.767
OR HE'S FRIGID? OR--

24:52.800 --> 24:55.067
NOBODY'S FRIGID.

24:55.067 --> 24:57.767
(sighs) MY BOYFRIEND'S MOTHER
CALLED ME SELFISH, OKAY?

24:57.800 --> 24:59.433
ARE YOU SELFISH?

24:59.467 --> 25:02.233
'CAUSE YOU DO SEEM KIND OF
SELF-OBSESSED TO ME.
(Ruth) BEN.

25:02.267 --> 25:03.467
HEY, I'M A SURGEON.

25:03.500 --> 25:05.267
IN ORDER TO BE A SURGEON,

25:05.300 --> 25:07.200
A CERTAIN AMOUNT
OF SELF-OBSESSION IS NECESSARY.

25:07.233 --> 25:08.733
MY BOYFRIEND GETS THAT.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.667
IF HIS MOTHER DOESN'T,
IT'S HER PROBLEM.

25:10.700 --> 25:12.833
I USED
TO HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

25:12.867 --> 25:14.767
WHEN I GOT THE TUMOR,
HE UNDERSTOOD.

25:14.800 --> 25:16.567
HE TRIED TO UNDERSTAND.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.467
HE LOVED ME.
BUT HIS MOTHER DIDN'T.

25:19.500 --> 25:22.567
MY OFFENDING EVERYONE
OFFENDED HER.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.400
AND HE SAID HE DIDN'T CARE
WHAT HIS MOTHER THOUGHT.

25:25.433 --> 25:27.333
BUT IN THE END, HE DID CARE.

25:27.367 --> 25:29.700
'CAUSE NOW
IT'S TWO YEARS LATER,

25:29.733 --> 25:32.067
AND I'M HAVING BRAIN SURGERY,

25:32.067 --> 25:34.733
AND ONLY MY FAT SISTER RUTH
IS WITH ME.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.100
(Cristina) BENJAMIN...

25:36.133 --> 25:37.633
THAT WAS KINDA RUDE.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.600
SORRY.

25:39.633 --> 25:42.333
***

25:43.700 --> 25:45.333
WHEN THE TUMOR'S REMOVED,

25:45.367 --> 25:47.533
IS IT GONNA BRING
HIS OLD PERSONALITY BACK?

25:47.567 --> 25:50.067
IF WE GET THE TUMOR OUT
AND BENJAMIN LIVES,

25:50.100 --> 25:52.067
ANYTHING ELSE
IS ICING ON THE CAKE.

25:52.067 --> 25:55.067
***

25:55.067 --> 25:56.767
(Callie) I'M LOCKING DOWN
THE EXTERNAL FIXATOR.

(Miranda)
THERE'S NO ACTIVE BLEEDING,

25:58.733 --> 26:00.133
AND THE TRAJECTORY
IS CLEAR.

26:00.167 --> 26:03.733
KAREV, I WANT YOU
TO HOLD PRESSURE ON THE LIVER.

26:03.767 --> 26:05.833
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN IN HERE,

26:05.867 --> 26:08.267
AND DON'T MOVE.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.667
(Richard) YOU WITH THE SAW,
DON'T MAKE A MOVE UNTIL WE GET

26:10.700 --> 26:12.833
OUR HANDS ON EVERY VITAL ORGAN
AROUND THE TREE TRUNK.

26:12.867 --> 26:14.800
THE PARENTS--
HAVE THEY SAID THEIR GOOD-BYES?

26:14.833 --> 26:18.333
MOM'S NOT HERE YET.
AND THE FATHER WAS TOO BUSY
BLAMING HIM TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

26:18.367 --> 26:19.667
SPEAK WHEN
YOU'RE SPOKEN TO, KAREV.

26:19.700 --> 26:22.233
I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OUT OF YOU TODAY.
ALL DUE RESPECT, DR. BAILEY,

26:22.267 --> 26:24.500
I THINK YOU GOT ME MIXED UP
WITH IZZIE STEVENS.

26:24.533 --> 26:27.067
(Richard) ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY.
TAKE YOUR POSITIONS.

26:27.100 --> 26:30.300
CUT CAREFULLY. WE'LL GET
THIS THING OUT IN PIECES.

26:30.333 --> 26:34.100

26:37.433 --> 26:39.333

YOU SEE THAT RIGHT THERE?

26:39.367 --> 26:43.500
IT'S TOO CLOSE
TO THE CAVERNOUS SINUS.

26:43.533 --> 26:44.767
SUCTION.

26:44.800 --> 26:46.800
***

26:46.833 --> 26:49.100
I'VE GOT A BLEEDER.
THE BRAIN IS STARTING TO SWELL.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.500
(woman) V-FIB.

26:50.533 --> 26:51.500
HIS HEART CAN'T TAKE IT.

WITH THOSE PADDLES. MOVE.

26:53.467 --> 26:55.300

HEPATIC ARTERY'S GONE.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
B.P. IS DROPPING.
ALL RIGHT, HE'S BLEEDING.

27:27.433 --> 27:28.733
JUST AS A STOPGAP,

27:28.767 --> 27:30.767
JUST UNTIL I FIGURE OUT
ANOTHER PLAN.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.767
I'M GONNA EAT
ALL OF THESE MUFFINS,

27:33.800 --> 27:40.067
AND I'M GONNA GET
REALLY, GLORIOUSLY FAT.

27:40.100 --> 27:41.500
(sniffles)

27:41.533 --> 27:43.767
IT'S OVER. OVER.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.267
OVER.

27:45.300 --> 27:48.133
I'M TALKING ABOUT THE LAST THIRD
OF MY LIFE, MIRANDA.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.600
HOW CAN THAT JUST BE OVER?

27:49.633 --> 27:51.467
HOW DOES THAT JUST END...

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
OVER A SKANKY PAIR OF PANTIES

27:53.533 --> 27:56.500
AND... A BAD TUX?

27:56.533 --> 27:58.600
I AM DESIRABLE, AMANDA.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.267
MIRANDA.
RIGHT.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.167
(Addison)
JOE... I'M DESIRABLE, RIGHT?

28:02.200 --> 28:03.733
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.067
BE THAT AS IT MAY,
I DON'T NEED ME TO TELL YOU

28:06.100 --> 28:08.367
HOW WILDLY ATTRACTIVE I AM--
WILDLY ATTRACTIVE.

28:08.400 --> 28:10.200
(Joe) YOU ARE...

28:10.233 --> 28:13.433
AND YOUR WILDLY ATTRACTIVE CAB
IS HERE.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.067
IT IS?

28:15.100 --> 28:17.767
YOU TOLD ME TO CALL YOU A CAB
AT 10:00. IT'S 10:00.

28:17.800 --> 28:19.667
I GUESS
THAT'S FOR THE BEST, HUH?

28:19.700 --> 28:22.400
I WOULD SAY SO.

28:22.433 --> 28:23.533
OHH.

28:23.567 --> 28:26.267
HEY.

28:26.300 --> 28:29.167
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?
I HAVE A LOT OF THEM.

28:29.200 --> 28:30.700
I'M TRYING
ONE OF EVERYTHING.

28:30.733 --> 28:34.067
HEY. HEY, AREN'T YOU
THE CAKE LADY FROM THIS MORNING?

28:34.067 --> 28:34.933
MM-HMM.

28:34.967 --> 28:36.833
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING SURGERY?

28:36.867 --> 28:38.767
OH, WELL, THAT HASN'T
BEEN DECIDED YET.

28:38.800 --> 28:41.333
SO YOU'RE A DOCTOR?
YES, I'M A DOCTOR.

28:41.367 --> 28:44.367
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU CAN'T DRINK WITH ME?
NOT AT ALL.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.533
(chuckles)

28:45.567 --> 28:47.100
JOE.

28:47.133 --> 28:50.367
***

28:50.400 --> 28:52.267
(Meredith) GEORGE...

28:52.300 --> 28:53.633
YOU'RE GONNA KILL SOMEONE.

28:53.667 --> 28:55.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M WORKIN' IT.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.500
IF CALLIE CAN BE BAD,
SO CAN I?

28:57.533 --> 28:59.133
***

28:59.167 --> 29:01.500
HEY, WATCH IT.

29:01.533 --> 29:03.733
GEORGE... CALLIE IS HOT.

29:03.767 --> 29:06.300
SHE'S, LIKE, REALLY SEXY,
LIKE, ALMOST DIRTY-HOT,

29:06.333 --> 29:07.667
AND SHE'S HOT FOR YOU.

29:07.700 --> 29:11.200
MAYBE YOU COULD KEEP USING
THE DARTS AS WEAPONS,

29:11.233 --> 29:13.133
OR YOU COULD GO GET LUCKY

29:13.167 --> 29:15.333
WITH THE SEXY,
HOT, DIRTY GIRL.

29:15.367 --> 29:18.267
***

29:18.300 --> 29:20.100
WHERE IS HE GOING?

29:20.133 --> 29:21.433
TO GET LAID.

29:21.467 --> 29:23.400
GOD, YOU KNOW, THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG IN THE WORLD

29:23.433 --> 29:24.767
WHEN BAMBI'S GETTING LAID,

29:24.800 --> 29:26.700
AND I CAN'T GET FIVE MINUTES
ALONE WITH BURKE.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:28.267 --> 29:30.433
DAY'S OVER. FLIPPIN' A COIN.
CALL IT.

29:30.467 --> 29:32.500
THE BRAIN SURGEON
SHOULD BE HEADS.

29:32.533 --> 29:33.467
RIGHT.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.700
***

29:38.767 --> 29:39.733
HMM.

29:42.500 --> 29:44.133
CHOICE MADE.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.333
OH, THAT'S IT?

29:46.367 --> 29:48.233
YOU'RE GONNA BASE YOUR CHOICE
ON FLIPPING A COIN?

29:48.267 --> 29:49.733
I'M TAKING A CUE
FROM BENJAMIN.

29:49.767 --> 29:52.633
IMPULSIVE, HONEST--
IT'S MY NEW MOTTO.

29:52.667 --> 29:55.533
BENJAMIN DIED.

29:57.133 --> 29:59.767
HE WASN'T IMPULSIVE, MEREDITH.
HE WASN'T HONEST.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.067
HE WAS SICK
AND BRAIN DAMAGED.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.233
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

30:11.533 --> 30:13.767
MR. HERNANDEZ.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.667
UH, MAY I?

30:18.867 --> 30:21.233
UH...

30:23.667 --> 30:25.667
YOU--YOU OKAY?

30:25.700 --> 30:28.167
YOUR SON,
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.033
HE WAS OFF WITH HIS FRIENDS.

30:31.067 --> 30:34.733
I LET HIM
GO OFF WITH THAT THING.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.767
I KNEW BETTER.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.700
I KNEW BETTER.

30:40.333 --> 30:43.767
HIS FRIEND, HE HAS
THIS DRIVEWAY UP ON A HILL.

30:45.833 --> 30:48.233
I JUST KEEP PICTURING HIM.

30:49.633 --> 30:53.233
I KEEP PICTURING HIM
GOING DOWN THAT HILL AND...

30:54.633 --> 30:57.767
AND I DIDN'T STOP HIM,
AND I SHOULD'VE STOPPED HIM.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.700
KIDS SPIN OUTTA CONTROL
SOMETIMES.

31:00.733 --> 31:03.600
THEY...
SPIN OUTTA CONTROL.

31:03.633 --> 31:05.133
YOU CAN'T--

31:05.167 --> 31:07.067
YES, YOU CAN.
YOU CAN CONTROL THEM.

31:07.100 --> 31:09.833
IT'S YOUR JOB AS A PARENT
TO CONTROL THEM.

31:09.867 --> 31:11.767
EVER SINCE THE DIVORCE,

31:11.800 --> 31:15.200
I ONLY GET TO SEE HIM
EVERY OTHER WEEKEND.

31:15.233 --> 31:17.133
I NEVER WOULDA BOUGHT HIM
THAT LUGE.

31:17.167 --> 31:19.833
I NEVER WOULDA LET HIM GO OFF
ON HIS OWN THAT WAY BEFORE.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.567
HMM.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.233
I WENT SOFT.

31:25.267 --> 31:29.100
I WENT SOFT WHEN HE NEEDED ME
TO BE THE FATHER.

31:36.333 --> 31:38.200
I WISH I'D HAD MORE FUN.

31:38.233 --> 31:40.800
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A SLUT.
DIDN'T WANT TO BE A TRAMP.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.467
DIDN'T HAVE ANY FUN.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.167
MY EX-HUSBAND,
HE HAD FUN--

31:45.200 --> 31:46.733
ALL SORTS OF FUN
WITH ALL SORTS OF WOMEN

31:46.767 --> 31:48.667
WHO WERE A LOT MORE FUN
THAN ME.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.600
NOBODY EVER CALLED HIM
A SLUT.

31:50.633 --> 31:52.267
WHY IS THAT?

31:52.300 --> 31:54.167
MEN CAN DO IT,
BUT WOMEN CAN'T.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.300
WOMEN CAN.
I KNOW SOME WHO DO.

31:56.333 --> 31:57.800
NOT WITHOUT
GETTING CALLED NAMES.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.233
WHAT DO YOU CARE
WHAT PEOPLE CALL YOU?

31:59.267 --> 32:02.100
I GET CALLED AN ASS.
I DON'T CARE.
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE AN ASS.

32:02.133 --> 32:04.667
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A SLUT.

32:08.333 --> 32:10.333
DO YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, ALEX?

32:10.367 --> 32:11.567
NO, NO GIRLFRIEND.

32:11.600 --> 32:13.333
SO YOU'RE SINGLE?

32:13.367 --> 32:15.167
YES, DEFINITELY.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.367
I'M SINGLE.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.267
I'M SINGLE, TOO.

32:19.867 --> 32:22.233
AND I'M VERY BAD AT THIS,

32:22.267 --> 32:24.533
NEVER HAVING HAD
ANY PRACTICE.

32:24.567 --> 32:28.833
SO, UM, I AM...

32:28.867 --> 32:31.200
I'M GONNA GO
INTO THE BATHROOM,

32:31.233 --> 32:34.433
AND IF I FIND MYSELF ALONE
IN THERE AFTER TWO MINUTES,

32:34.467 --> 32:37.333
I'LL JUST TOUCH UP MY MAKEUP
AND COME BACK OUT.

32:37.367 --> 32:39.200
BUT SHOULD YOU HAVE
ANY INTEREST

32:39.233 --> 32:43.300
IN FULFILLING THE WISH
OF A POTENTIALLY DYING WOMAN,

32:43.333 --> 32:45.467
YOU KNOW WHERE I'LL BE.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.367
***

33:17.300 --> 33:21.067

I LIKE YOU.

34:08.167 --> 34:09.733
AND I LIKE YOU.

34:09.767 --> 34:11.833
AND I THOUGHT I HAD
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

34:11.867 --> 34:13.767
I THOUGHT I HAD TO DECIDE.

34:13.800 --> 34:15.700
BUT I THINK I OWE MYSELF
THE CHANCE

34:15.733 --> 34:18.100
TO CONSIDER MY OPTIONS.

34:18.133 --> 34:19.567
OPTIONS?
OPTIONS?

34:19.600 --> 34:21.667
THERE'S THIS THING
THAT ALLOWS FOR

34:21.700 --> 34:23.700
THE CONSIDERING OF OPTIONS.

34:23.733 --> 34:26.200
IN THE OLDEN DAYS,
THEY CALLED IT DATING.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.600
DATING.

34:27.633 --> 34:29.400
YES.
I'D LIKE TO TRY THAT.

34:29.433 --> 34:31.800
YOU WANNA TRY DATING.
YES.

34:31.833 --> 34:33.733
BOTH OF US?

34:33.767 --> 34:35.067
YES.

34:35.067 --> 34:36.800

IF YOU'RE NOT UP FOR IT.

34:36.833 --> 34:40.467
BUT I REALLY HOPE YOU ARE.

I DON'T THINK SO.

34:55.867 --> 34:58.067
***

34:58.067 --> 35:00.667
YOU'RE HERE FIRST,
YOU GET ALL THE BEST CASES.

35:00.700 --> 35:03.200
TRAUMA COMES IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT,

35:03.233 --> 35:04.567
YOU GET FIRST DIBS.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.667
EXACTLY.

35:05.700 --> 35:07.567
YEAH, I RESPECT IT,
I DO.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.633
AND ALSO, I CAN'T HAVE IT.
AND YOU KNOW THAT.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.167
YOU'RE THROWING ME OUT?

35:12.200 --> 35:14.067
GOT NO CHOICE.

35:14.100 --> 35:16.567
THIS VIOLATES ALL SORTS
OF CODES, AND YOU KNOW IT.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.100
SO I HAVE TO GO,

35:18.133 --> 35:20.700

IN YOUR OFFICE?

35:22.200 --> 35:24.133
YOU NOTICED THAT, HUH?

35:24.167 --> 35:26.067
YEAH, I'M PRETTY OBSERVANT.

35:26.067 --> 35:28.733
GUESS IF I'M THROWING YOU OUT,
I HAVE TO FOLLOW MY OWN RULE.

35:28.767 --> 35:30.400
OKAY, I'M JEALOUS.

35:30.433 --> 35:32.333
BUT I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE JEALOUS,

35:32.367 --> 35:36.267
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT OTHER GUYS
TOUCHING YOUR PANTIES.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.067
GREAT.

35:39.067 --> 35:40.567
THAT'S GREAT.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.833
YOU MIGHT WANNA
CLEAR THAT UP.

DR. BAILEY,
YOU WERE RIGHT.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.667
I-I SHOULDN'T BE GETTING
PHYSICAL WITH PATIENTS.

36:10.700 --> 36:15.500
THE BODY IS A SLAVE
TO ITS IMPULSES.

36:15.533 --> 36:17.567
***

36:17.600 --> 36:22.200

WELL, I DO, BABY.

36:24.067 --> 36:25.233
I DO KNOW.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.067
(sighs)

36:28.233 --> 36:30.167
CRISTINA, IT'S LATE.

36:30.200 --> 36:32.667
PRESTON NEEDS HIS SLEEP.

36:32.700 --> 36:36.500

THAT MAKES US HUMAN...

36:36.533 --> 36:37.767
I'M SORRY, MRS. BURKE.

36:37.800 --> 36:40.600
I WAS JUST COMING IN TO SEE IF
EITHER OF YOU NEEDED ANYTHING

36:40.633 --> 36:42.533
BEFORE I WENT HOME
FOR THE EVENING.

36:42.567 --> 36:45.333
IS WHAT WE CAN CONTROL.

36:45.367 --> 36:47.400
WE'RE FINE.

36:47.433 --> 36:49.333
GOOD NIGHT, PRESTON.

AFTER THE RUSH...

37:07.233 --> 37:10.633
AFTER THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT
HAS PASSED...

37:10.667 --> 37:12.400
THE PANTIES?

37:12.433 --> 37:13.733
YEAH.

37:13.767 --> 37:15.067
NOT MINE.

YEAH.

***

37:24.533 --> 37:26.800
WHAT'S WITH THE SUITCASE?

37:26.833 --> 37:28.733
WE CAN COOL OFF

37:28.767 --> 37:33.300
AND CLEAN UP THE MESSES
WE'VE MADE.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.233

37:38.667 --> 37:40.567
I'M BUSY, YOU GUYS.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

(Miranda) IZZIE.

37:42.267 --> 37:44.533
***

38:00.700 --> 38:03.367
I WENT SOFT.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.633
I... HAD A BABY,

38:05.667 --> 38:08.400
AND I SWORE
IT WOULDN'T CHANGE ME,

38:08.433 --> 38:11.400
BUT IT JUST--

38:11.433 --> 38:13.833
IT DOES CHANGE YOU.

38:13.867 --> 38:16.333
I GOT TIRED,

38:16.367 --> 38:18.133
I GOT BUSY,

38:18.167 --> 38:19.800
AND I STOPPED TEACHING.

38:19.833 --> 38:21.433
I STOPPED TEACHING

38:21.467 --> 38:23.667
WHEN YOU NEEDED
A TEACHER THE MOST.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.067
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
STOPPED ME.

38:26.067 --> 38:27.567
YES, I COULD'VE.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.500
YOU COULDN'T
HAVE STOPPED YOU,

38:29.533 --> 38:31.500
BUT I COULD HAVE.

38:31.533 --> 38:35.400
AND IN THE PAST,
I WOULD HAVE.

38:35.433 --> 38:38.433
I WENT SOFT.

38:40.700 --> 38:46.133
AND I'M PARTLY TO BLAME
FOR WHAT HAPPENED, SO...

38:48.133 --> 38:50.800
I WANT YOU TO COME BACK.

38:50.833 --> 38:52.500
YOU WILL TALK TO THE CHIEF.

38:52.533 --> 38:57.400
WE'LL WORK IT OUT,
BECAUSE YOU'RE TALENTED,

38:57.433 --> 38:58.767
AND YOU'RE CAPABLE,

38:58.800 --> 39:04.433
AND WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES,
AND--

39:04.467 --> 39:07.133
AND IT'S ENOUGH MUFFINS.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.467
***

39:09.500 --> 39:13.333
WE CAN TRY TO LET GO
OF WHAT WAS...

39:13.367 --> 39:15.600
***

39:15.633 --> 39:17.767
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ROOM SERVICE.

39:25.467 --> 39:28.667
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

39:28.700 --> 39:32.500
I'M NOT PROUD
OF WHAT I DID.

39:32.533 --> 39:34.467
YOU DESERVE BETTER.

39:34.500 --> 39:37.633
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT THE...

39:37.667 --> 39:40.767
SORRY ABOUT THE PANTIES...

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
AND THE PROM.

39:45.067 --> 39:47.300
I-I'M SORRY I DID THAT.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.767
***

39:55.533 --> 39:58.167
YEAH.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.300
I'M SORRY
YOU DID THAT, TOO.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.767
OUR MARRIAGE IS OVER.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.833
YEAH, I GUESS IT IS.

40:07.867 --> 40:10.800
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

40:10.833 --> 40:14.100
GOD, THIS IS
INCREDIBLY SAD.

40:15.433 --> 40:17.833
I'M INCREDIBLY SAD.

40:17.867 --> 40:19.700
***

40:19.733 --> 40:24.100
AND THEN AGAIN...

40:24.133 --> 40:26.067
***

40:26.100 --> 40:27.233
OH.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.700
WELL, THIS IS AWKWARD.

40:29.733 --> 40:32.633
***

40:35.333 --> 40:37.200
AHH. I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW.

40:37.233 --> 40:39.167
AHH.

40:39.200 --> 40:42.100
