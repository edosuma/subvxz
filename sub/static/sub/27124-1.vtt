<i>Jules Verne
once wrote,</i>

01:07.927 --> 01:10.426
<i>"Put two ships
in the open sea</i>

01:10.428 --> 01:13.765
<i>"without wind or tide,
they will come together."</i>

01:35.854 --> 01:40.525
<i>That's how my parents met.
Like two ships destined for each other.</i>

01:45.196 --> 01:47.130
<i>We are something else.
Try Arthur Treacher...</i>

01:54.406 --> 01:55.604
It's okay.

02:03.315 --> 02:07.649
Easy. You weren't breathing.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.598
<i>They were
from different worlds.</i>

02:24.969 --> 02:27.069
<i>But life,
like the sea,</i>

02:27.071 --> 02:29.540
<i>has a way
of bringing people together.</i>

03:12.616 --> 03:13.884
Uh...

03:15.186 --> 03:16.920
I was gonna
make you some eggs.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.689
Just don't eat my dog, okay?

03:24.295 --> 03:25.627
It's okay.

03:25.629 --> 03:27.165
I made tea.

03:32.136 --> 03:33.635
Go on, try it.

03:33.637 --> 03:34.905
It'll make you better.

03:55.826 --> 03:57.961
So, uh, who are you?

04:02.199 --> 04:03.734
Atlanna.

04:05.502 --> 04:07.237
Queen of Atlantis.

04:08.972 --> 04:10.872
Wow.

04:10.874 --> 04:15.845
I'm Tom. Keeper of lighthouse.

04:46.976 --> 04:49.043
<i>She had fled
an arranged marriage.</i>

04:49.045 --> 04:51.078
<i>Left her whole world behind.</i>

04:51.080 --> 04:53.280
<i>But in my father's lighthouse,</i>

04:53.282 --> 04:55.751
<i>she found something
unexpected.</i>

04:58.387 --> 05:02.359
<i>And my father
found the love of his life.</i>

05:06.997 --> 05:08.563
<i>Category 4 Hurricane Arthur</i>

05:08.565 --> 05:11.466
<i>is due to make landfall
sometime after 2:00 p.m.</i>

05:11.468 --> 05:13.803
How about Arthur?

05:14.404 --> 05:15.871
After the hurricane?

05:15.873 --> 05:20.575
After a legend.
He's a king, isn't he?

05:20.577 --> 05:23.378
He's more than that.

05:23.380 --> 05:27.048
He's living proof
our people can coexist.

05:27.050 --> 05:29.919
He could unite
our worlds one day.

05:37.960 --> 05:42.096
And the trident could only
be wielded by the strongest Atlantean.

05:42.098 --> 05:47.435
And it gave King Atlan mastery
over the seven seas.

05:47.437 --> 05:51.640
It made him so powerful that
the ocean itself became jealous

05:51.642 --> 05:56.110
and sent a terrible earthquake
to destroy Atlantis.

05:56.112 --> 05:58.512
Down it fell,
to the bottom of the ocean.

05:58.514 --> 06:03.117
But, legend has it that one
day a new king will come

06:03.119 --> 06:05.452
who will use
the power of the trident

06:05.454 --> 06:08.688
to put Atlantis back together again.

06:14.830 --> 06:16.765
Take him!

06:35.050 --> 06:36.417
<i>Queen Atlanna,</i>

06:36.419 --> 06:38.552
<i>by the authority
of King Orvax,</i>

06:38.554 --> 06:41.655
<i>you are ordered
to return to Atlantis.</i>

06:41.657 --> 06:42.924
Atlanna!

06:45.528 --> 06:47.996
<i>But Atlantis'
memory is long...</i>

06:49.831 --> 06:52.633
<i>And its king refused
to let her go.</i>

07:05.214 --> 07:07.481
- Atlanna!
- Tom!

07:07.483 --> 07:09.385
- My weapon!
- Here!

07:35.844 --> 07:38.778
<i>Their two worlds
were never meant to meet,</i>

07:38.780 --> 07:42.181
<i>and I was a product of a love
that never should've been.</i>

07:42.183 --> 07:44.150
You don't have to do this,
Atlanna. Please.

07:44.152 --> 07:48.289
No. They will always find me.

07:48.291 --> 07:50.058
Next time,
they'll send an army.

07:52.127 --> 07:56.565
I have to go back.
It is the only way to save him.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.570
Save you.

08:06.141 --> 08:08.176
Where I come from...

08:09.811 --> 08:12.814
The sea carries
our tears away.

08:15.350 --> 08:16.351
Not here.

08:17.686 --> 08:19.354
Here you feel them.

08:27.228 --> 08:31.566
I will return to you.
When it's safe.

08:32.433 --> 08:33.566
One day.

08:33.568 --> 08:36.504
Right here, at sunrise.

08:39.441 --> 08:41.008
We'll be together again.

08:42.876 --> 08:45.745
You stay strong,
my little prince.

08:45.747 --> 08:47.948
I'll always be with you.

08:56.223 --> 08:59.427
Don't let him forget me. Hmm?

09:24.252 --> 09:26.853
All life came from the sea,

09:26.855 --> 09:29.122
so if we want
to understand ourselves,

09:29.124 --> 09:31.090
we must journey
to where we began.

09:31.092 --> 09:35.961
Now, today, we have better maps of
Mars than we do of our own sea floor.

09:35.963 --> 09:38.097
Come on, closer.
Come on, fishy.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.566
- Come on. Come over here.
- Boys!

09:40.568 --> 09:42.835
Stop that. Come on.

09:42.837 --> 09:45.003
Come along.

09:45.005 --> 09:48.940
Bye, fishy. Bye.

09:48.942 --> 09:52.077
My name's Arthur.
What's yours?

09:52.079 --> 09:55.280
- You guys hungry? Me, too.
- Check it out.

09:55.282 --> 09:57.817
Arthur is talking to the fish.

09:57.819 --> 09:59.519
Such a freak, Arthur.

09:59.521 --> 10:02.154
- Stop!
- What are you gonna do about it, freak?

10:02.156 --> 10:04.322
Stop it! Don't!

10:04.324 --> 10:05.527
Let me go!

12:03.042 --> 12:04.308
Who are you?

12:04.310 --> 12:06.011
Come on, let's go.
Move it.

12:06.013 --> 12:08.180
Come on. Hurry up.

12:17.290 --> 12:18.990
Sir, we've secured
the captain.

12:18.992 --> 12:20.859
Distress signal's disabled.

12:20.861 --> 12:22.493
We're running dark again.

12:22.495 --> 12:24.896
But they heard it.
You can count on it.

12:24.898 --> 12:29.533
I'll make you a deal.
I won't tell you how to captain...

12:29.535 --> 12:31.737
And you don't tell me
how to pirate.

12:42.815 --> 12:44.481
Where's the rest of the crew?

12:44.483 --> 12:46.317
Decided discretion
was the better part of valor

12:46.319 --> 12:48.419
and sealed themselves up
in the torpedo bay.

12:48.421 --> 12:50.120
Our reputation precedes us.

12:50.122 --> 12:51.789
Your reputation.

12:51.791 --> 12:53.225
This is your win.

12:58.030 --> 12:59.433
Here.

13:00.934 --> 13:03.200
Can't take that piece of junk.

13:03.202 --> 13:04.638
It's the love of your life.

13:06.138 --> 13:08.475
I never told you
the story behind it.

13:09.408 --> 13:11.910
This was your grandfather's.

13:11.912 --> 13:15.680
He was one of the Navy's first
frogmen during World War II.

13:15.682 --> 13:21.418
He was so stealthy in the water,
his unit nicknamed him Manta.

13:21.420 --> 13:24.188
But after the war,
his country forgot about him.

13:24.190 --> 13:28.762
So, he went back to the sea,
scavenging and surviving with his wit...

13:29.295 --> 13:31.328
And this knife.

13:31.330 --> 13:34.367
He gave it to me
when I was your age.

13:37.169 --> 13:38.871
And now it's yours, son.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.635
Did we just hit something?

14:11.137 --> 14:14.303
No. Something hit us.

14:14.305 --> 14:15.806
Sir, there's something
out there.

14:15.808 --> 14:17.007
Another submarine?

14:17.009 --> 14:18.642
Uh... No. I think it's a man.

15:07.059 --> 15:08.594
That's not a man.

15:12.198 --> 15:16.667
<i>Alpha, to the right.
Bravo team, sweep the passageway.</i>

15:38.224 --> 15:39.624
Permission to come aboard?

17:10.147 --> 17:11.415
Aquaman!

17:39.844 --> 17:42.881
I've waited
a long time for this.

17:56.526 --> 17:58.129
Am I supposed to know
who you are?

17:59.364 --> 18:01.531
I scavenge the high seas.

18:02.499 --> 18:03.765
You're the Aquaman.

18:03.767 --> 18:06.034
We were bound
to meet at some point.

18:10.040 --> 18:11.475
Let's not make it a habit.

18:12.009 --> 18:13.076
Up.

19:07.365 --> 19:08.565
Ow.

19:21.912 --> 19:23.213
Dad!

19:25.248 --> 19:27.048
Dad? Ow.

19:29.519 --> 19:30.721
That's your kid?

19:35.959 --> 19:37.158
Shame on you.

19:39.062 --> 19:40.829
Boys got yourselves
into this mess.

19:40.831 --> 19:42.097
Get yourselves out of it.

19:42.099 --> 19:43.100
Bastard!

19:52.541 --> 19:53.910
Dad!

20:02.252 --> 20:03.286
Dad!

20:06.323 --> 20:07.688
Wait!

20:07.690 --> 20:09.523
Help me! He's trapped!

20:09.525 --> 20:11.294
You can't leave him like this!

20:13.129 --> 20:14.528
Please!

20:14.530 --> 20:18.601
You killed innocent people.
You ask the sea for mercy.

20:32.214 --> 20:33.515
Get outta here! I got this!

20:33.517 --> 20:35.182
Shut up, I'm not leaving you!

20:35.184 --> 20:39.153
You need to live,
so you can kill that son of a bitch!

20:42.425 --> 20:44.758
- Now, go!
- No!

20:44.760 --> 20:46.328
- Go!
- Shut up!

20:51.167 --> 20:52.168
No!

20:52.835 --> 20:53.835
No!

21:11.620 --> 21:13.290
Damn you!

21:13.856 --> 21:14.857
Go.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.869
I always know
where to find you.

22:35.703 --> 22:37.071
Old habits.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.748
- Come on, I'll buy you breakfast.
- All right!

22:51.786 --> 22:55.056
You want me to have them put
that in a sippy cup for you?

22:58.126 --> 22:59.893
How is it that I can
breathe underwater,

22:59.895 --> 23:02.296
but you can still drink me
under the table?

23:02.298 --> 23:05.132
That's my superpower.

23:05.134 --> 23:06.732
<i>A Russian submarine</i>

23:06.734 --> 23:08.968
<i>hijacked late last night
by high-tech pirates.</i>

23:08.970 --> 23:11.104
<i>The same pirates
who are suspected</i>

23:11.106 --> 23:13.973
<i>in connection with the disappearance
of the Navy's highly classified</i>

23:13.975 --> 23:16.476
<i>prototype stealth submarine.</i>

23:16.478 --> 23:19.812
<i>And a further development,
we now have unconfirmed reports</i>

23:19.814 --> 23:23.550
<i>that the metahuman dubbed by
social media as "The Aquaman"</i>

23:23.552 --> 23:25.421
<i>was responsible
for this daring rescue.</i>

23:26.522 --> 23:27.853
That's not me.

23:27.855 --> 23:32.024
Bullshit. You're doing it,
aren't you? Huh?

23:32.026 --> 23:34.293
What Vulko trained you to do.

23:34.295 --> 23:38.532
I knew you couldn't stand
on the sidelines forever.

23:38.534 --> 23:40.634
Your mother
always knew you were special.

23:40.636 --> 23:42.201
Don't even start.

23:42.203 --> 23:45.271
She believed you'd be the one
to unite our two worlds.

23:45.273 --> 23:46.441
Just stop.

23:49.644 --> 23:53.613
Whatever Atlantis' problems
are, you're bigger than them.

23:53.615 --> 23:55.648
Atlantis murdered my mother.

23:55.650 --> 23:57.149
You don't know that for sure.

23:57.151 --> 23:58.517
Yes, I do.

23:58.519 --> 24:02.323
They killed her.
For loving you and having me.

24:02.924 --> 24:04.525
And you know it.

24:08.762 --> 24:12.764
Son, one day you're gonna
have to stop blaming yourself.

24:18.972 --> 24:20.208
Hey, buddy.

24:21.643 --> 24:24.044
You that fish boy from the TV?

24:25.280 --> 24:26.414
Oh, great.

24:32.687 --> 24:36.087
It's "fish man."
What do you want?

24:36.089 --> 24:38.091
I'll tell you what I want.

24:41.763 --> 24:43.461
Could we get
a picture with you?

24:43.463 --> 24:46.398
You're like
our local hero, man.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.037
It would mean a lot.
Just a quick...

24:54.608 --> 24:55.940
Whatever.

24:55.942 --> 24:57.542
- All right. Let's do this.
- Don't touch me.

24:57.544 --> 24:59.845
Right, that's exactly right.
I'm gonna go down here.

24:59.847 --> 25:02.448
There we go. Everybody smile.

25:55.803 --> 25:58.838
He understands the
significance of this meeting.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.806
He'll hear you out.

26:19.959 --> 26:22.160
- King Orm.
- King Nereus.

26:22.162 --> 26:25.597
You picked a meeting place too
close to the surface for my liking.

26:25.599 --> 26:28.433
You don't recognize
the Council of the Kings?

26:28.435 --> 26:31.836
In Atlan's time,
when the Seven Kingdoms were one,

26:31.838 --> 26:34.539
our ancestors gathered here.

26:34.541 --> 26:37.243
Atlantis sat here
at the head of the table.

26:38.043 --> 26:40.944
Xebel, as always, by his side.

26:40.946 --> 26:42.814
Brine. Fishermen.

26:42.816 --> 26:45.048
The Deserters and the Trench
had not yet fallen.

26:45.050 --> 26:47.151
The Lost Nation
had not yet vanished.

26:47.153 --> 26:51.121
Together, they were the greatest
empire the world had ever seen.

26:51.123 --> 26:53.123
But now,
I sit on Atlan's throne,

26:53.125 --> 26:55.827
shackled by archaic laws
and politics.

26:55.829 --> 26:57.995
While the threat above us
grows undeniably...

26:57.997 --> 27:00.300
Violence has always
plagued the surface.

27:01.101 --> 27:02.534
They will destroy themselves.

27:02.536 --> 27:05.370
Not before
destroying us first.

27:05.372 --> 27:08.640
We have been hiding
long enough.

27:08.642 --> 27:12.444
The time has come
for Atlantis to rise again.

27:12.446 --> 27:14.614
We honor you,
King Nereus,

27:16.016 --> 27:19.417
by inviting Xebel
to be the first kingdom

27:19.419 --> 27:21.719
to join King Orm's alliance.

27:21.721 --> 27:23.555
As if you had a choice, Vulko.

27:23.557 --> 27:25.723
By law, you need
four of the Seven Kingdoms

27:25.725 --> 27:27.392
to ascend and attack.

27:27.394 --> 27:29.594
The Lost Nation and the
Deserters have long perished.

27:29.596 --> 27:31.663
The Trench are nothing
but animals.

27:31.665 --> 27:34.299
The Brine will never join you,
and the Fishermen are cowards.

27:34.301 --> 27:39.437
Without me and my army to convince
them, your plans are stillborn.

27:39.439 --> 27:41.806
But I know
what you really want.

27:41.808 --> 27:44.676
Once you've obtained the
pledge of the four kingdoms,

27:44.678 --> 27:46.345
you will be ordained

27:47.481 --> 27:48.748
Ocean Master.

27:50.216 --> 27:52.216
That is merely a title.

27:52.218 --> 27:54.218
I'm no fool, King Orm.

27:54.220 --> 27:55.687
As Ocean Master,
you'll be commander

27:55.689 --> 27:58.489
of the greatest military might
on this planet.

27:58.491 --> 28:00.493
I am the natural choice
to lead it.

28:02.628 --> 28:04.729
Are you?

28:04.731 --> 28:07.364
What about the rumors
that there's another?

28:07.366 --> 28:10.969
An Atlantean,
living among the surface.

28:10.971 --> 28:13.437
One of royal blood.

28:13.439 --> 28:17.341
You may sit on the throne of Atlantis,
but your claim to it is weak.

28:17.343 --> 28:19.476
How can you possibly hope
to unite the empire?

28:19.478 --> 28:22.813
My mother's bastard has
never even been to Atlantis.

28:22.815 --> 28:24.047
His loyalty is to the surface.

28:34.827 --> 28:37.263
Surface-dwellers! To arms!

28:58.049 --> 28:59.316
Your king is injured!

29:58.944 --> 30:01.145
I'm not trying to start a war.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.613
The war has already begun.

30:03.615 --> 30:07.218
Then it's time we send them
a message they'll hear.

30:11.556 --> 30:12.923
- I'm good.
- Stop.

30:12.925 --> 30:14.724
- Here're the keys.
- Thank you.

30:14.726 --> 30:17.126
Let's go home
and work on your <i>ta moko.</i> Huh?

30:17.128 --> 30:18.628
If your grandpops
was still alive,

30:18.630 --> 30:20.698
he'd be banging our heads
for not finishing it.

30:22.667 --> 30:25.468
Yes, he would, but there is
plenty of time for that.

30:25.470 --> 30:28.172
We gotta get you to bed.

30:30.575 --> 30:31.674
Got it?

30:38.383 --> 30:39.949
I've been looking for you.

30:39.951 --> 30:41.283
Oh, no, no, no...

30:41.285 --> 30:42.652
I need you to come with me
to Atlantis.

30:42.654 --> 30:44.487
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you the same thing

30:44.489 --> 30:46.489
that I told that
rusty starfish Vulko.

30:46.491 --> 30:48.524
Except nicer,
because you're a lady.

30:48.526 --> 30:50.526
No, thank you.
I'm not interested.

30:50.528 --> 30:53.696
You defeated Steppenwolf
and saved Atlantis.

30:53.698 --> 30:55.865
That had nothing to do
with Atlantis.

30:55.867 --> 30:59.201
Your half-brother King Orm is about
to declare war upon the surface world.

30:59.203 --> 31:01.138
Billions will die.

31:01.140 --> 31:02.574
Your people and mine.

31:03.374 --> 31:05.276
We must stop him.

31:09.815 --> 31:11.715
And how do you propose
we do that?

31:11.717 --> 31:15.184
You are the firstborn son
of Queen Atlanna.

31:15.186 --> 31:17.486
The throne is yours
by birthright.

31:17.488 --> 31:22.993
The only way to stop this war
and save both worlds

31:22.995 --> 31:26.562
is for you to take
your rightful place as king.

31:29.267 --> 31:32.401
You think if I just show up,
Orm's gonna give up the throne?

31:32.403 --> 31:35.971
I'm the bastard son of the
queen your people executed.

31:35.973 --> 31:38.607
Trust me. I am no king.

31:38.609 --> 31:39.475
I agree.

31:39.477 --> 31:41.877
That's awesome. Cool.

31:41.879 --> 31:44.847
But, Vulko seems to believe
in you for some reason,

31:44.849 --> 31:46.482
and that's why I'm here.

31:46.484 --> 31:49.385
Vulko has learned of the location
of the Lost Trident of Atlan.

31:49.387 --> 31:51.454
Ooh, fairy tales. It's a myth.

31:51.456 --> 31:52.988
It's not a myth.

31:52.990 --> 31:55.091
With the Sacred Trident,
the people will listen to you.

31:55.093 --> 31:58.393
You can then claim your
birthright and dethrone Orm.

31:58.395 --> 32:02.263
My birthright?
It died with my mother.

32:02.265 --> 32:04.667
But I promise you this.
If Orm attacks,

32:04.669 --> 32:07.839
I will treat him exactly the
same way your people treated her.

32:09.173 --> 32:10.607
With no mercy.

33:08.065 --> 33:12.668
<i>That submarine was barely operational,
but it served its purpose.</i>

33:12.670 --> 33:16.437
One of your kind intervened.

33:16.439 --> 33:18.506
<i>He is not one of us.</i>

33:18.508 --> 33:21.411
He killed my father.

33:22.180 --> 33:24.648
<i>Our transaction has ended.</i>

33:28.318 --> 33:31.755
Keep the money.
I want Aquaman.

34:42.725 --> 34:43.926
Dad!

34:49.199 --> 34:50.399
Dad!

35:17.861 --> 35:18.862
Dad!

35:23.432 --> 35:24.667
Pops!

35:26.202 --> 35:27.668
Pops!

35:30.407 --> 35:32.741
Come on, Pops.

35:33.542 --> 35:36.277
Come on! He's not breathing.

35:36.279 --> 35:37.579
Move! Let me help.

35:45.121 --> 35:46.488
Come on, Pops.

35:58.033 --> 35:59.034
Come on.

36:13.514 --> 36:15.816
I don't even know your name.

36:15.818 --> 36:18.586
It's Princess Y'Mera
Xebella Challa.

36:20.289 --> 36:21.589
You may call me Mera.

36:23.359 --> 36:24.893
Thank you, Mera.

36:46.047 --> 36:47.515
Dear God.

36:48.217 --> 36:49.851
This was Orm's doing.

36:51.652 --> 36:53.554
The worst is yet to come.

37:01.163 --> 37:02.996
<i>There's a
flash flood warning here</i>

37:02.998 --> 37:05.699
<i>that was just extended
for a couple hours.</i>

37:05.701 --> 37:08.301
<i>Unprecedented sights
from all over the world today.</i>

37:08.303 --> 37:11.972
<i>We are seeing warships and trash
washed up by massive waves.</i>

37:11.974 --> 37:15.308
<i>These extraordinary scenes
of coastlines deluged with waste</i>

37:15.310 --> 37:17.811
<i>and garbage are taking place
all over the world.</i>

37:17.813 --> 37:21.081
<i>Decades of pollution
has been thrown back onto land.</i>

37:21.083 --> 37:22.916
<i>Many are asking the question,</i>

37:22.918 --> 37:24.284
<i>"Was this a natural disaster
or something else?"</i>

37:24.286 --> 37:26.887
<i>No. This was
no natural disaster.</i>

37:26.889 --> 37:29.222
<i>They threw out our garbage
and our warships.</i>

37:29.224 --> 37:31.624
<i>This was our first contact
with the people of Atlantis.</i>

37:31.626 --> 37:34.928
<i>There you go again with your
insane Atlantean theory.</i>

37:34.930 --> 37:36.829
<i>You have absolutely
no proof, Dr. Shin.</i>

37:36.831 --> 37:38.265
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

37:38.267 --> 37:39.832
<i>We already have
an Atlantean living among us,</i>

37:39.834 --> 37:41.569
<i>and his name is Aquaman.</i>

37:49.144 --> 37:50.876
What is it?

37:50.878 --> 37:55.081
This is the exact spot that Vulko
gave me my first swimming lesson.

37:55.083 --> 37:58.418
You have to forget all
the teaching of the surface world

37:58.420 --> 38:03.189
and go deeper to uncover
your Atlantean instincts.

38:03.191 --> 38:05.459
But I already know
how to swim.

38:05.461 --> 38:07.195
Not even close.

38:10.466 --> 38:12.698
Just so we're clear,

38:12.700 --> 38:14.735
I'll help you stop this war.

38:15.336 --> 38:16.971
But then, I'm done.

38:17.839 --> 38:19.774
Maybe that's for the best.

38:40.094 --> 38:42.394
The ocean is more than
our life source, Arthur.

38:42.396 --> 38:43.795
It is who we are.

38:43.797 --> 38:45.897
Wait, you can talk underwater?

38:45.899 --> 38:49.401
I can talk underwater, too!

38:49.403 --> 38:51.669
This is awesome!

38:51.671 --> 38:54.641
Oh, we can do more
than just talk.

39:00.648 --> 39:05.784
Being Atlantean means more than
just being able to breathe water.

39:05.786 --> 39:10.789
Your body is equipped to survive
the extreme cold and pressure,

39:10.791 --> 39:13.327
and your eyes adjust
to see in the dark.

39:37.285 --> 39:38.683
This is awesome!

40:06.314 --> 40:09.883
So, Vulko,
when can I meet my mother?

40:12.018 --> 40:14.352
Soon, my young prince.

40:14.354 --> 40:18.758
When you're ready, I'll take you
to Atlantis to meet the queen.

40:29.035 --> 40:30.904
I hid my ship in here.

40:32.572 --> 40:34.405
Listen,
I'm not getting in that thing.

40:34.407 --> 40:36.341
Well, to get where we're
going, you're gonna have to.

40:36.343 --> 40:38.509
Your fish ship has been
marinating in chum butter.

40:38.511 --> 40:40.511
I'm gonna come out
smelling like swamp butt.

40:40.513 --> 40:42.249
That'd be an improvement.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.822
Yup. Okay.

41:50.583 --> 41:52.684
What's the point in
having a bridge underwater?

41:52.686 --> 41:55.086
The Gateway Bridge
is a remnant of the Old World.

41:55.088 --> 41:57.088
It's also the only way
in or out of the Capital.

41:57.090 --> 41:58.623
Why can't they just
go over the walls?

41:58.625 --> 42:00.258
Security is impenetrable.

42:00.260 --> 42:01.992
Even if they did
manage to evade the guards,

42:01.994 --> 42:03.929
they'd never get past
the hydro-cannons.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.966
People try to sneak in
all the time.

42:09.436 --> 42:10.903
Yeah, right.

42:30.889 --> 42:32.155
What is this?

42:32.157 --> 42:34.591
Customs
and border control.

42:34.593 --> 42:37.596
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

42:45.471 --> 42:46.472
Welcome home.

43:35.120 --> 43:37.387
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

43:37.389 --> 43:40.657
The Highborns never venture
to the sea floor.

43:40.659 --> 43:41.660
We're here.

44:10.923 --> 44:12.589
What is this?

44:12.591 --> 44:14.925
We use this air pocket as an
extra layer of precaution.

44:14.927 --> 44:17.494
Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air.

44:17.496 --> 44:19.331
Plus,
it keeps the animals out.

44:20.131 --> 44:22.200
They get kind of messy.

44:24.803 --> 44:26.703
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

44:26.705 --> 44:29.741
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

44:32.376 --> 44:36.212
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

44:36.214 --> 44:38.547
I can't believe Orm attacked.

44:38.549 --> 44:39.482
It wasn't an attack.

44:39.484 --> 44:41.818
Legally,
he's not allowed to yet.

44:41.820 --> 44:45.254
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

44:45.256 --> 44:46.790
What provoked it?

44:46.792 --> 44:50.426
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

44:50.428 --> 44:53.062
By the surface?
I don't think so.

44:53.064 --> 44:54.997
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

44:54.999 --> 44:56.699
I was there.

44:56.701 --> 44:58.568
A surface warship fired at us.

44:58.570 --> 45:01.304
Now, Xebel sides
with Atlantis,

45:01.306 --> 45:06.209
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

45:06.211 --> 45:10.780
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

45:10.782 --> 45:14.049
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

45:14.051 --> 45:15.819
You don't understand.

45:15.821 --> 45:18.321
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

45:18.323 --> 45:22.057
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

45:22.059 --> 45:24.728
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

45:24.730 --> 45:26.295
Okay? I don't even know
where to begin.

45:26.297 --> 45:28.765
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

45:28.767 --> 45:33.505
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

45:38.409 --> 45:39.477
Hmm.

45:40.211 --> 45:41.813
I already got one of those.

45:43.047 --> 45:45.314
Not like this one, you don't.

45:45.316 --> 45:47.984
This is
the Lost Trident of Atlan.

45:47.986 --> 45:49.218
Oh, I know the story.

45:49.220 --> 45:52.721
It's more than a story.
It's real.

45:52.723 --> 45:57.760
<i>It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</i>

45:57.762 --> 46:01.532
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

46:02.333 --> 46:05.534
<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

46:05.536 --> 46:09.774
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

46:11.142 --> 46:12.975
So what happened to it?

46:12.977 --> 46:16.579
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

46:16.581 --> 46:20.816
<i>when King Atlan
ruled over all that was,</i>

46:20.818 --> 46:23.588
<i>when the kingdoms of Atlantis
were one.</i>

46:26.023 --> 46:32.528
<i>It was a time of great prosperity
and technological advancement.</i>

46:32.530 --> 46:35.163
<i>We had unlocked
the secret of unlimited energy</i>

46:35.165 --> 46:36.899
<i>at a time when
the rest of the world</i>

46:36.901 --> 46:38.636
<i>still thought the earth
was flat.</i>

46:41.104 --> 46:44.305
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

46:44.307 --> 46:46.976
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

47:03.194 --> 47:06.697
<i>The ocean swallowed us,
and Atlantis sank.</i>

47:08.265 --> 47:11.200
<i>But the very power that
collapsed our civilization</i>

47:11.202 --> 47:14.503
<i>also paved the way
to our future.</i>

47:14.505 --> 47:17.708
<i>It gave us the ability
to breathe underwater.</i>

47:18.409 --> 47:21.410
<i>And so, we evolved.</i>

47:21.412 --> 47:24.580
<i>Others regressed,
became savage.</i>

47:26.384 --> 47:31.720
And the king lived out the remainder
of his days in self-imposed exile.

47:31.722 --> 47:36.091
<i>Neither he nor the trident
were ever seen again.</i>

47:36.093 --> 47:40.361
One of our archeological teams
uncovered this a few months ago.

47:40.363 --> 47:44.232
It's an ancient recording dating
back to the First Dynasty.

47:44.234 --> 47:47.970
I believe it contains Atlan's
final message to his people

47:47.972 --> 47:51.040
and the whereabouts
of the Sacred Trident.

47:51.042 --> 47:52.473
So, what does it say?

47:52.475 --> 47:55.243
We don't know.
The technology's too old.

47:55.245 --> 47:59.014
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

47:59.016 --> 48:01.816
You must take it there
and retrieve the message.

48:01.818 --> 48:05.789
The clue to Atlan's final
resting place is inside of this.

48:23.039 --> 48:26.206
<i>Border Defense.
You are under arrest for illegal entry.</i>

48:26.208 --> 48:27.410
No!

48:29.112 --> 48:30.945
You mustn't be seen here!

49:26.836 --> 49:28.805
I don't suppose you want
to talk about this, do you?

49:33.977 --> 49:35.476
Neither do I.

50:14.883 --> 50:19.888
<i>In the name of His Highness, King
Orm, I place you under arrest.</i>

50:40.442 --> 50:42.110
Welcome to Atlantis...

50:43.312 --> 50:44.513
Brother.

50:48.784 --> 50:51.519
I can't believe
you're finally here.

50:52.921 --> 50:55.757
I've heard so many stories
about you.

51:01.530 --> 51:04.731
All these years,
I've been ashamed of my mother

51:04.733 --> 51:08.870
for defiling herself
with a surface-dweller.

51:08.872 --> 51:11.939
Ashamed of the fact that I
have a half-breed brother

51:11.941 --> 51:15.876
whose heart I wanted
to run my trident through.

51:15.878 --> 51:20.281
But now that you're finally here before
me, I must admit...

51:28.090 --> 51:29.589
I am conflicted.

51:29.591 --> 51:31.892
You want conflict,

51:31.894 --> 51:34.561
why don't you take these chains
off, little brother?

51:34.563 --> 51:36.498
And we'll see
who gets run through.

51:38.867 --> 51:43.870
Yes, I see you've brought
our mother's weapon.

51:43.872 --> 51:47.574
Is that why you've come here
after all this time?

51:47.576 --> 51:49.175
To kill me?

51:49.177 --> 51:51.978
I came here to stop a maniac
from destroying the world.

51:51.980 --> 51:53.914
I see.

51:53.916 --> 51:55.749
And how do you plan
to stop the atrocities

51:55.751 --> 51:59.686
that the surface
continues to commit?

51:59.688 --> 52:04.458
Because for a century,
they have polluted our waters

52:05.426 --> 52:07.794
and poisoned our children.

52:07.796 --> 52:11.364
And now, their skies burn
and our oceans boil.

52:13.467 --> 52:17.070
And you've come all this way to
take sides against your own people?

52:17.072 --> 52:19.239
There are no sides
in a war like this.

52:19.241 --> 52:21.974
You have clearly chosen a side and
come here to challenge the throne.

52:21.976 --> 52:24.011
If that's what it takes
to stop your war.

52:26.081 --> 52:28.948
Are you invoking
the Combat of the Kings?

52:28.950 --> 52:33.253
Call it whatever you want.
I call it an ass-whooping.

52:33.255 --> 52:35.788
Well then, perhaps
that's how we'll proceed.

52:35.790 --> 52:37.556
- Your Majesty!
- Orm, please.

52:37.558 --> 52:38.958
Don't you see?

52:38.960 --> 52:40.993
If I defeat the firstborn son
of Atlanna

52:40.995 --> 52:43.462
in a formal challenge
in front of everyone,

52:43.464 --> 52:48.567
then all Seven Kingdoms will have to
concede that I am the one true king.

52:48.569 --> 52:52.571
Your Majesty, there is no victory
in defeating the ignorant.

52:52.573 --> 52:54.175
Your brother
is clearly an imbecile.

52:55.843 --> 52:58.111
Your Highness,
he doesn't know our ways.

52:58.113 --> 53:00.248
Then he's about to get
an education.

53:01.783 --> 53:03.750
Are you officially
challenging me?

53:03.752 --> 53:05.952
Hell yes, I challenge you.
And when I win...

53:05.954 --> 53:07.486
If you win,

53:07.488 --> 53:11.193
I will cease all immediate action.
The war is over.

53:12.060 --> 53:13.661
But if I win...

53:15.397 --> 53:16.597
You're over.

53:17.366 --> 53:18.897
Let's do it.

53:18.899 --> 53:20.532
So be it.

53:20.534 --> 53:23.569
Challenge has been made,
and I accept.

53:23.571 --> 53:26.039
Prepare him
for the Ring of Fire.

53:26.041 --> 53:29.244
Wait. The ring of what?

53:47.361 --> 53:51.230
How could you be so foolish
to let Orm bait you into a fight?

53:51.232 --> 53:53.932
It seems to me like I just
solved all of our problems.

53:53.934 --> 53:56.235
I beat him in a battle,
war's over, I get to go home.

53:56.237 --> 53:58.470
You're a formidable fighter
on land,

53:58.472 --> 54:01.006
but here you're out
of your element, literally.

54:01.008 --> 54:03.809
Orm has spent
his entire life underwater,

54:03.811 --> 54:07.513
training to be a warrior,
training to be the best.

54:07.515 --> 54:09.680
You taught me
how to fight, Cobra Kai.

54:09.682 --> 54:11.819
Let's see
if you remember anything.

54:15.555 --> 54:16.922
So, what's with the big fork?

54:16.924 --> 54:19.692
It's a trident.
Now, defend yourself.

54:53.259 --> 54:54.759
What the hell is this?

54:54.761 --> 54:57.064
I'll teach you this move when
you've mastered the trident.

55:07.241 --> 55:08.740
It's not fair.

55:08.742 --> 55:10.809
This thing is so big and awkward.
Why can't I use a sword?

55:10.811 --> 55:14.580
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

55:14.582 --> 55:18.183
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

55:18.185 --> 55:19.852
Why has she never
come to see me, huh?

55:19.854 --> 55:21.987
I told you,
when you're ready...

55:21.989 --> 55:26.091
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

55:26.093 --> 55:28.926
And every time I pass a test,
you make up another one.

55:28.928 --> 55:30.364
When am I gonna
be good enough?

55:35.269 --> 55:37.136
Does she not love me?

55:37.138 --> 55:40.372
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

55:40.374 --> 55:44.208
But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

55:44.210 --> 55:47.579
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

55:47.581 --> 55:49.280
so she had to marry him...

55:49.282 --> 55:52.750
And bear him a son,
Prince Orm.

55:52.752 --> 55:55.086
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

55:55.088 --> 55:57.655
he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

55:57.657 --> 56:02.328
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the Trench.

56:05.064 --> 56:07.667
Are you saying
they executed her?

56:08.868 --> 56:10.170
Because she had me?

56:24.816 --> 56:26.651
I remember...

56:26.653 --> 56:27.954
Everything.

56:31.457 --> 56:34.358
I have something for you.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.462
It belonged to my mother.

56:38.096 --> 56:40.964
Tell me...

56:40.966 --> 56:44.470
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

56:46.038 --> 56:50.575
I understand your fear
and your reluctance, Mera.

56:50.577 --> 56:53.910
I truly do. I don't want war...

56:53.912 --> 56:55.312
Don't patronize me!

56:55.314 --> 56:56.781
I know you.

56:56.783 --> 56:58.483
What you're doing flies
in the face of everything

56:58.485 --> 57:00.451
that your mother taught us
when we were children.

57:00.453 --> 57:01.553
If she were here...

57:01.555 --> 57:05.523
But she's not here, is she?

57:05.525 --> 57:08.228
1What my mother taught us
was treason.

57:08.995 --> 57:11.796
Don't follow in her wake.

57:11.798 --> 57:14.732
All right! So, this is the
big, old ring of fire, huh?

57:14.734 --> 57:17.870
How's it work?
I just kick your ass right here?

57:21.474 --> 57:22.873
Vulko.

57:22.875 --> 57:26.845
Will you escort my betrothed
to the royal box?

57:38.291 --> 57:39.758
Let's go, Lady Mera.

57:45.632 --> 57:49.667
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

57:49.669 --> 57:54.572
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

57:54.574 --> 57:58.975
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

57:58.977 --> 58:03.681
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

58:03.683 --> 58:07.317
Atlantis has been
lying in wait...

58:07.319 --> 58:09.221
And now,
the beast has awakened.

58:15.827 --> 58:21.166
There was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

58:22.267 --> 58:24.467
Get to know my little brother.

58:24.469 --> 58:29.074
Let him know that he wasn't alone,
that we were in it together.

58:31.610 --> 58:34.446
If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be.

58:37.349 --> 58:41.318
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.921
And I've hated you
for it ever since.

58:46.191 --> 58:49.892
But I do not want
to kill you, Arthur.

58:49.894 --> 58:53.130
I'm going to give you
one chance.

58:53.799 --> 58:56.165
Go home.

58:56.167 --> 58:59.071
Do not ever
come back to Atlantis.

59:00.606 --> 59:03.541
You are not going to win this.

59:03.543 --> 59:07.344
A war is coming to the surface
whether you like it or not.

59:07.346 --> 59:10.982
And I am bringing the wrath
of the seven seas with me.

59:12.117 --> 59:14.286
You know I can't
let that happen.

59:15.554 --> 59:17.122
I know.

59:19.991 --> 59:21.460
What the hell is that?

59:23.562 --> 59:25.063
The Ring of Fire.

59:34.206 --> 59:35.105
Yeah!

59:37.942 --> 59:39.877
Yeah!

59:46.618 --> 59:48.018
Shit.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.755
People of Atlantis, hear me!

59:51.757 --> 59:55.627
My brother has come from the surface
to challenge me for the throne.

59:57.362 --> 01:00:00.597
Let us settle his claim
in the ancient way.

01:00:00.599 --> 01:00:05.134
By bloodshed do the gods
make known their will!

01:00:14.579 --> 01:00:16.113
Traitor!

01:00:16.748 --> 01:00:18.115
Traitor!

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:25.623
You'll never be king!

01:00:40.137 --> 01:00:41.904
Never thought I'd see the day
when my own father

01:00:41.906 --> 01:00:43.739
would bow before
the king of Atlantis.

01:00:43.741 --> 01:00:47.776
The surface-dwellers drew first blood.
What would you have us do?

01:00:47.778 --> 01:00:49.244
Beg them for mercy?

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:51.613
I detest the surface
as much as you do.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:54.951
But don't you find the timing
of all of this a bit convenient?

01:00:58.323 --> 01:01:02.226
But you wouldn't be
that gullible, would you?

01:01:04.896 --> 01:01:06.830
You want this war too,
don't you?

01:01:06.832 --> 01:01:09.431
It is past time the surface-dwellers
learned their place in the world.

01:01:09.433 --> 01:01:12.169
If this is how it must be
done, then so be it.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.409
You have our mother's trident.

01:01:20.411 --> 01:01:23.614
Powerful, but flawed like her.

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:26.083
I wield my father's.

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:29.084
And it has never known defeat!

01:02:17.635 --> 01:02:20.134
I promised Atlanna
I'd protect him.

01:02:27.410 --> 01:02:30.781
This isn't a competition.
It's an execution.

01:04:27.797 --> 01:04:31.566
I am the one true king!

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:17.245
You waiting for an invitation?
Get in!

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.357
Mera!

01:05:32.327 --> 01:05:34.061
Oh, yeah.
So, what's the plan?

01:05:34.063 --> 01:05:37.198
The plan was to recover Atlan's
trident, then challenge Orm.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.933
Okay, so we're doing things
a little out of order.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:39.936
Shit happens.

01:05:45.507 --> 01:05:47.440
Heads up!
We got a bogey on our six!

01:05:47.442 --> 01:05:49.709
- What does that even mean?
- Bad guys behind us.

01:05:49.711 --> 01:05:52.479
- Then just say that!
- Bad guys behind us!

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:02.082
Whoa, whoa, wait,
you said we couldn't go over these walls.

01:07:02.084 --> 01:07:04.083
- I did!
- You said there were hydro-cannons!

01:07:04.085 --> 01:07:05.353
I did, now shut up!

01:07:09.691 --> 01:07:11.693
Oh, shit!

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:36.417
Shit!

01:07:37.052 --> 01:07:38.785
Shit.

01:07:38.787 --> 01:07:41.790
We're not dead yet!
But I'm hoping he'll think we are.

01:07:43.524 --> 01:07:44.759
Oh!

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.400
Here, hold this.

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:56.735
What are you doing?

01:07:56.737 --> 01:07:58.570
- Listen, it worked for Pinocchio.
- Who?

01:07:58.572 --> 01:08:01.375
Never mind.
Come here, get in. Come on.

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:05.512
Great.
So we're getting eaten.

01:08:27.001 --> 01:08:29.234
How are you even
doing this, anyway?

01:08:29.236 --> 01:08:31.002
I don't know.

01:08:31.005 --> 01:08:33.572
I can hear them sometimes,
and they can hear me.

01:08:33.573 --> 01:08:36.439
Right. Because you're
both big, dumb animals.

01:08:36.442 --> 01:08:38.977
- Hey, I just saved your life.
- I saved yours first!

01:08:43.483 --> 01:08:45.483
She said, "Coast is clear."

01:08:45.484 --> 01:08:47.620
So, where to now?

01:08:48.856 --> 01:08:52.524
To the ocean of sand
your people call the Sahara.

01:08:53.426 --> 01:08:54.995
All right.

01:09:18.519 --> 01:09:20.118
I don't usually
take charters,

01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.654
but I don't usually get paid
in pirate treasure.

01:09:22.656 --> 01:09:23.924
Thanks for the ride, buddy.

01:09:25.926 --> 01:09:27.893
Oh, man.

01:09:27.895 --> 01:09:29.661
Are you okay?

01:09:29.662 --> 01:09:31.865
I've never been
so high up before.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.602
Or so far from home.

01:09:36.603 --> 01:09:38.470
But at least you have a home.

01:09:39.273 --> 01:09:40.805
Not anymore.

01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:42.506
I can never go back.

01:09:42.508 --> 01:09:45.478
I betrayed everything when I
saved you from the coliseum.

01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:52.649
Yeah, but you're engaged to the king.
They have to take you back.

01:09:52.652 --> 01:09:55.820
Atlantis is many
wonderful things.

01:09:55.822 --> 01:09:57.722
But forgiving, it is not.

01:09:57.724 --> 01:09:59.057
Yeah, but you're royalty.

01:09:59.059 --> 01:10:01.360
So was your mother.

01:10:01.362 --> 01:10:04.229
If I went back now,
I'd be sacrificed to the Trench.

01:10:04.231 --> 01:10:06.933
Even my own father
wouldn't take me back.

01:10:11.472 --> 01:10:13.405
Look on the bright side,

01:10:13.407 --> 01:10:15.673
now you don't have to marry some tool
bag that you're not in love with.

01:10:15.675 --> 01:10:18.876
My obligation isn't to love.

01:10:18.878 --> 01:10:21.446
It is to my family
and my nation,

01:10:21.448 --> 01:10:23.516
and I've turned
my back on both.

01:10:25.818 --> 01:10:29.587
Sometimes,
you have to do what's right,

01:10:29.589 --> 01:10:32.525
even if your heart aches
against it.

01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:50.741
Your Highness.

01:10:50.743 --> 01:10:55.849
The tracker places Princess Mera
here, in the Deserter Kingdom.

01:10:56.483 --> 01:10:57.918
You said she was dead.

01:10:58.519 --> 01:10:59.987
Apparently not.

01:11:01.422 --> 01:11:03.188
Then your brother
still lives as well?

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:04.523
Not for long.

01:11:04.525 --> 01:11:06.525
Captain Murk, assemble
a strike force immediately.

01:11:06.527 --> 01:11:11.263
No! Mera is to be arrested
and safely returned to me.

01:11:11.265 --> 01:11:12.431
She betrayed the throne.

01:11:12.433 --> 01:11:14.832
She is a daughter of Xebel.

01:11:14.834 --> 01:11:17.802
If any harm befalls her,
our coalition is over.

01:11:17.804 --> 01:11:19.371
Your Highness,

01:11:19.373 --> 01:11:22.773
we are now entering the waters
of the Fishermen Kingdom.

01:11:22.775 --> 01:11:26.877
Securing the alliance
of the other two kingdoms

01:11:26.879 --> 01:11:28.981
should be
our immediate concern.

01:11:32.118 --> 01:11:38.089
My vizier is correct.
As usual.

01:11:38.091 --> 01:11:44.597
Arrest them and bring back
King Nereus' daughter unharmed.

01:12:07.487 --> 01:12:08.988
We're here!

01:12:10.389 --> 01:12:11.654
Hey!

01:12:11.656 --> 01:12:13.190
Is there anything nearby?

01:12:13.192 --> 01:12:15.292
Nothing but desert
for hundreds of K's, mate!

01:12:15.294 --> 01:12:17.328
- Nothing but desert.
- He's wrong.

01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:20.399
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Wait! No! Oh...

01:12:23.101 --> 01:12:25.969
She just jumped!
She didn't have a parachute!

01:12:25.971 --> 01:12:28.472
Redheads! You gotta love 'em.

01:12:43.623 --> 01:12:45.755
Shit!

01:12:57.904 --> 01:12:59.702
Oh, you're crazier
than I thought!

01:12:59.704 --> 01:13:01.140
A-ha!

01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:03.708
This way.

01:13:24.796 --> 01:13:28.367
<i>You were defeated the last time because
your surface weapons failed you.</i>

01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:30.469
<i>Ours will not.</i>

01:13:33.872 --> 01:13:35.406
<i>It's prototype armor</i>

01:13:35.408 --> 01:13:38.274
<i>for the next generation
Atlantean soldier.</i>

01:13:38.276 --> 01:13:41.010
<i>Revenge is something
we Atlanteans understand.</i>

01:13:41.012 --> 01:13:44.380
<i>You will lead my finest
commandos as your personal army</i>

01:13:44.382 --> 01:13:46.950
<i>to hunt down
the half-breed abomination.</i>

01:13:46.952 --> 01:13:51.454
<i>I cannot touch them, but you can.
He's fled to your world.</i>

01:13:51.456 --> 01:13:54.924
<i>Kill him and the woman he's
with, and you will be rewarded.</i>

01:13:54.926 --> 01:13:57.229
Killing him is my reward.

01:14:00.699 --> 01:14:03.068
<i>The crown jewel.
Still experimental.</i>

01:14:04.636 --> 01:14:07.505
<i>Converts water into beams
of energized plasma.</i>

01:15:19.678 --> 01:15:21.277
Hmm.

01:15:21.279 --> 01:15:23.780
I think I'm gonna need
a bigger helmet.

01:15:23.782 --> 01:15:26.382
One of the tribes of
Atlantis broke off and settled here

01:15:26.384 --> 01:15:28.551
when this region
was still an inland sea.

01:15:28.553 --> 01:15:31.387
When the water dried up,
they perished along with it.

01:15:31.389 --> 01:15:33.121
Perished?
Yeah, that's terrific.

01:15:33.123 --> 01:15:34.357
We're getting close now.

01:15:34.359 --> 01:15:36.825
Oh, yeah? Close to what?
Dying of thirst?

01:15:36.827 --> 01:15:38.795
Close to getting
punched in the face!

01:15:38.797 --> 01:15:40.596
Look, <i>Fight Club,</i> I know you're
new to how things work up here.

01:15:40.598 --> 01:15:42.898
Why don't you look around?
We are lost.

01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:44.500
You see that over there?
Hey, what is that?

01:15:44.502 --> 01:15:47.269
<i>Nada.</i> This place
is a wasteland.

01:15:47.271 --> 01:15:49.772
You're the one who calls
this wasteland a home.

01:15:49.774 --> 01:15:51.406
This isn't my home!

01:15:51.408 --> 01:15:53.241
It's not like the whole
surface looks like this!

01:15:53.243 --> 01:15:55.177
Oh, no, of course not.

01:15:55.179 --> 01:15:58.413
You've also got disgusting cities
whose sewers empty out into our ocean

01:15:58.415 --> 01:16:00.315
and whole mountains
made out of trash.

01:16:00.317 --> 01:16:02.017
And, oh, you've got
great factories

01:16:02.019 --> 01:16:03.919
that do nothing but belch
out filth and melt ice caps.

01:16:03.921 --> 01:16:05.987
Okay. Point taken. Listen.

01:16:05.989 --> 01:16:07.456
Yeah, we got
some idiots running the show,

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:09.458
but we've got some
good things too, all right?

01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.727
We got green forests and big
mountains and beautiful lakes.

01:16:11.729 --> 01:16:14.563
You'd love 'em.
They're like little baby oceans.

01:16:14.565 --> 01:16:16.398
Are you trying to provoke me?

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.100
I'm just saying you cannot judge a
place before you've even seen it.

01:16:18.102 --> 01:16:20.937
You've judged Atlantis
on far less.

01:16:24.341 --> 01:16:27.875
No. Would you just stop it
with that? No.

01:16:27.877 --> 01:16:31.480
Your stupid Atlantean GPS just
told you to jump out of an airplane

01:16:31.482 --> 01:16:33.448
over the middle of the desert,
and now we are stranded.

01:16:36.754 --> 01:16:39.390
If you're the next true
king, we're doomed.

01:17:07.718 --> 01:17:09.052
That was awesome.

01:17:14.224 --> 01:17:17.060
Oh. Look what I found.

01:17:18.061 --> 01:17:19.361
What you found?

01:17:19.363 --> 01:17:20.364
Yeah.

01:17:30.774 --> 01:17:32.476
Check this place out.

01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:34.709
This is badass!

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.747
This is
the Hall of Armory.

01:17:38.749 --> 01:17:42.084
Where the legends say
Atlan's trident was forged.

01:17:43.454 --> 01:17:45.589
I don't think
they're legends anymore.

01:17:51.829 --> 01:17:53.262
Vulko was right.

01:17:55.799 --> 01:17:57.233
It's real.

01:18:34.570 --> 01:18:35.605
Huh.

01:18:36.339 --> 01:18:38.305
Nothing.

01:18:38.307 --> 01:18:40.307
Of course it's not working.

01:18:40.309 --> 01:18:42.678
It's been sitting here collecting dust
since before the Sahara was a desert.

01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:46.647
Man!

01:18:46.649 --> 01:18:49.683
"Since before
the Sahara was a desert."

01:18:49.685 --> 01:18:51.852
Thank you for repeating
what I just said.

01:18:51.854 --> 01:18:53.723
It's completely dried out.

01:18:55.659 --> 01:18:57.224
Let's just say
you do your best thinking

01:18:57.226 --> 01:18:59.226
when you're not
thinking at all.

01:18:59.228 --> 01:19:00.294
All right, now hold still.

01:19:00.296 --> 01:19:02.563
Hey. What are you doing?

01:19:02.565 --> 01:19:05.702
We need water,
and you're the closest source.

01:19:06.703 --> 01:19:08.337
Now, hold still.

01:19:14.477 --> 01:19:15.511
Hmm.

01:19:44.507 --> 01:19:45.641
Show-off.

01:19:46.509 --> 01:19:48.143
I could have just peed on it.

01:19:58.588 --> 01:19:59.755
King Atlan.

01:20:01.757 --> 01:20:06.894
<i>In this trident
resides the power of Atlantis.</i>

01:20:06.896 --> 01:20:10.798
<i>In the wrong hands,
it would bring destruction.</i>

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.067
<i>But in the hands
of the true heir,</i>

01:20:13.069 --> 01:20:17.170
<i>it would unite all our
kingdoms above and below.</i>

01:20:17.172 --> 01:20:22.108
<i>If you seek my power,
you must prove your worth.</i>

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:25.645
<i>Journey beyond the edge of
the world to the Hidden Sea.</i>

01:20:25.647 --> 01:20:28.915
<i>Look inside the bottle
for the charted path.</i>

01:20:28.917 --> 01:20:34.656
<i>Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see.</i>

01:20:42.897 --> 01:20:44.198
Hmm.

01:20:51.039 --> 01:20:52.239
We can't let Orm find this.

01:20:54.676 --> 01:20:55.843
Hey! Wait!

01:20:56.946 --> 01:20:58.479
What?

01:20:58.481 --> 01:21:00.279
Shouldn't we have
written it down first?

01:21:00.281 --> 01:21:02.384
I memorized it. Didn't you?

01:21:03.986 --> 01:21:05.554
Oh, yeah. Totally.

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.423
What'd he just say?

01:21:10.258 --> 01:21:12.460
"Something something trident."

01:21:26.741 --> 01:21:29.711
"Look inside the bottle
for the charted path."

01:21:35.884 --> 01:21:37.686
It's our next stop.

01:23:11.478 --> 01:23:14.379
I'm starting to think you actually
like these surface-dwellers.

01:23:14.381 --> 01:23:17.317
It would be wrong to judge a
place I've never seen before.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:21.923
I'll be right back.
Don't go anywhere.

01:23:41.075 --> 01:23:44.943
Well, apparently, it's just right
up on the hill. A big old castle.

01:23:44.945 --> 01:23:47.815
And I just learned something
very interesting.

01:23:50.384 --> 01:23:54.287
You risked our lives based on something
you read in a children's book?

01:23:54.289 --> 01:23:57.589
Wait, it's a book?
How about that?

01:23:57.591 --> 01:23:58.990
Oh!

01:23:58.992 --> 01:24:00.392
I got it from the movie.

01:24:05.899 --> 01:24:09.333
King Nereus,
I had hoped our people had evolved

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:11.502
beyond that ancient notion

01:24:11.504 --> 01:24:13.738
that war with the surface
is inevitable.

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:16.574
It is the position
of the Fishermen

01:24:16.576 --> 01:24:19.845
that when the time comes to make
ourselves known to the landsmen,

01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:23.717
it should be to educate them,
not to destroy them.

01:24:25.018 --> 01:24:27.788
I admire your lofty
aspirations, King Ricou.

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:36.527
But I suspect they are but clouds
of ink hiding the heart of a coward.

01:24:36.529 --> 01:24:39.064
How dare you!

01:24:40.933 --> 01:24:43.235
Please. I implore you.

01:24:43.237 --> 01:24:47.037
You're a kingdom of bloated
philosophers and flaccid poets

01:24:47.039 --> 01:24:50.574
whose waters have grown
stagnant, and it sickens me.

01:24:59.186 --> 01:25:00.685
My King!

01:25:00.687 --> 01:25:04.458
The king is dead!
Long live his heir.

01:25:06.193 --> 01:25:07.427
Princess.

01:25:08.428 --> 01:25:12.030
Prepare your armies,
Your Highness.

01:25:12.032 --> 01:25:15.569
We move against
the Brine Kingdom at once.

01:25:23.043 --> 01:25:25.110
What did
the recording say, again?

01:25:25.112 --> 01:25:28.079
"Journey beyond the edge
of the world to the Hidden Sea.

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.181
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path.

01:25:30.183 --> 01:25:34.487
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:39.159
"Look in the bottle
for the charted path."

01:25:41.128 --> 01:25:42.461
Hmm.

01:25:44.298 --> 01:25:45.831
Oh, man.

01:25:46.366 --> 01:25:47.564
What?

01:25:47.566 --> 01:25:49.934
Wow.
That's awesome.

01:25:49.936 --> 01:25:51.103
Let me see.

01:25:52.471 --> 01:25:54.672
Wow. But how do you know
where to point it?

01:25:54.674 --> 01:25:56.207
Here, let me see.

01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:57.908
What was the last line?

01:25:57.910 --> 01:26:01.379
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

01:26:01.381 --> 01:26:03.115
"Only in the hands
of the true..."

01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:06.717
Marcus Agrippa.

01:26:06.719 --> 01:26:08.688
He was a great general,
but he wasn't a king.

01:26:10.556 --> 01:26:12.058
Neither was Scipio.

01:26:13.359 --> 01:26:15.025
How do you know
all this stuff?

01:26:15.027 --> 01:26:17.127
Because of my pops.
He made sure I knew my history.

01:26:17.129 --> 01:26:23.434
None of these guys are kings,
except this guy. Romulus.

01:26:23.436 --> 01:26:25.470
First king of Rome.

01:26:27.539 --> 01:26:30.709
"Only in the hands of the
true king can he truly see."

01:26:40.685 --> 01:26:42.685
There it is.
That's our heading.

01:26:42.687 --> 01:26:44.656
What? Let me see.

01:26:46.891 --> 01:26:48.058
We did it!

01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:49.228
Oh!

01:26:51.029 --> 01:26:52.998
That's not bad
for an imbecile, huh?

01:26:55.268 --> 01:26:56.702
Not bad at all.

01:27:10.484 --> 01:27:11.784
Mera.

01:27:13.619 --> 01:27:19.456
"Loathsomeness
waits and dreams in the deep,

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:24.730
"and decay spreads over
the tottering cities of men."

01:27:28.434 --> 01:27:29.667
Get back!

01:27:35.107 --> 01:27:36.275
Arthur!

01:27:39.178 --> 01:27:40.878
I order you to stand down!

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:43.082
<i>Princess Mera,
you've been charged with high treason.</i>

01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:04.734
Who the hell are you?

01:28:04.736 --> 01:28:06.938
Maybe this will
jog your memory.

01:28:54.819 --> 01:28:56.986
You're the guy from the sub.

01:28:56.988 --> 01:28:58.422
That's right.

01:28:59.791 --> 01:29:02.228
But now I have
Atlantean steel.

01:29:07.866 --> 01:29:10.835
Call me "Black Manta."

01:29:25.917 --> 01:29:28.119
You thought
you could walk away?

01:29:33.992 --> 01:29:35.894
I thought I told you
not to make this a habit.

01:29:56.514 --> 01:29:57.814
You can't run.

01:29:58.616 --> 01:30:00.882
You owe me blood!

01:30:00.884 --> 01:30:02.552
How'd you find me?

01:30:02.554 --> 01:30:06.823
Your lady friend has people
who like to keep tabs on her.

01:31:23.568 --> 01:31:24.768
No!

01:31:59.169 --> 01:32:00.170
Come on.

01:32:04.807 --> 01:32:06.675
Everybody, inside.
Get inside.

01:32:11.748 --> 01:32:15.849
I'll show you the
same mercy you showed my father.

01:32:15.851 --> 01:32:18.687
And gut you
like the fish you are!

01:34:13.869 --> 01:34:15.402
Arthur!

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.542
Mera, they're tracking you.

01:34:21.544 --> 01:34:22.676
What?

01:34:22.678 --> 01:34:24.413
They're tracking you.

01:34:35.223 --> 01:34:38.393
Arthur, stay with me.

01:34:39.060 --> 01:34:42.130
Arthur, wake up! Arthur.

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.113
Um...

01:35:33.682 --> 01:35:35.314
Did you steal a boat?

01:35:35.316 --> 01:35:38.451
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

01:35:38.453 --> 01:35:41.622
No, those belong to people.

01:35:41.624 --> 01:35:43.422
Huh.

01:35:45.193 --> 01:35:46.927
Those were
Orm's elite commandos.

01:35:46.929 --> 01:35:50.229
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

01:35:50.231 --> 01:35:52.598
I've never seen him before.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.267
Yeah, I have.

01:35:54.269 --> 01:35:56.771
He and his father
were pirates.

01:35:58.239 --> 01:36:00.806
And he blames me
for his father's death.

01:36:00.808 --> 01:36:05.380
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

01:36:06.214 --> 01:36:08.149
That's not how it feels.

01:36:10.184 --> 01:36:14.153
It was up to me,
and I let him die.

01:36:14.155 --> 01:36:17.055
I could've saved him,
but I didn't.

01:36:17.057 --> 01:36:21.027
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

01:36:21.029 --> 01:36:22.530
And that would
have been my fault.

01:36:24.432 --> 01:36:26.534
Well, he's behind us now.

01:36:27.769 --> 01:36:30.371
It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

01:36:31.973 --> 01:36:35.309
The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

01:36:36.945 --> 01:36:39.379
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

01:36:40.014 --> 01:36:41.379
Yes.

01:36:41.381 --> 01:36:43.481
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

01:36:43.483 --> 01:36:45.651
It's become a place of death.

01:36:45.653 --> 01:36:47.855
We know next to nothing
about what's down there.

01:36:51.993 --> 01:36:54.226
We should turn back.

01:36:54.228 --> 01:36:57.030
We can still warn the surface.
Try and prepare them for what's coming.

01:36:57.032 --> 01:36:58.631
Turn back?

01:36:58.633 --> 01:37:02.668
Look, I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

01:37:02.670 --> 01:37:05.906
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

01:37:05.908 --> 01:37:08.908
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:13.379
But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip.

01:37:13.381 --> 01:37:16.415
I'm no leader.
I'm not a king.

01:37:16.417 --> 01:37:20.152
I do not work
or play well with others.

01:37:20.154 --> 01:37:24.857
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

01:37:24.859 --> 01:37:29.562
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

01:37:29.564 --> 01:37:32.698
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:35.436
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

01:37:39.272 --> 01:37:40.775
The only question is...

01:37:43.511 --> 01:37:44.679
Can you?

01:37:59.961 --> 01:38:03.764
The tracking on Lady Mera
is still dark, Your Highness.

01:38:04.798 --> 01:38:06.266
Vulko.

01:38:07.035 --> 01:38:08.901
My trusted vizier

01:38:08.903 --> 01:38:12.572
who has stood by the throne
since my father sat upon it.

01:38:14.641 --> 01:38:17.542
Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

01:38:17.544 --> 01:38:20.679
I have already
given it, My King.

01:38:20.681 --> 01:38:24.184
But I will stand
by your decision, as always.

01:38:24.818 --> 01:38:26.353
My decision.

01:38:28.321 --> 01:38:29.723
To protect it.

01:38:32.125 --> 01:38:33.493
While you betray it.

01:38:34.661 --> 01:38:38.195
You think I do not know
of your treachery?

01:38:38.197 --> 01:38:43.501
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

01:38:43.503 --> 01:38:48.942
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

01:38:51.945 --> 01:38:53.613
Do not deny it.

01:38:56.751 --> 01:38:57.885
I do not.

01:38:58.485 --> 01:38:59.754
Why?

01:39:01.254 --> 01:39:04.123
I am the pureblood.

01:39:04.125 --> 01:39:07.159
I have devoted my life
to Atlantis.

01:39:07.161 --> 01:39:10.662
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

01:39:10.664 --> 01:39:11.663
I do serve it.

01:39:11.665 --> 01:39:14.332
Arthur may only be
half-Atlantean,

01:39:14.334 --> 01:39:18.472
but he's already twice
the king you'll ever be.

01:39:24.778 --> 01:39:26.246
Take him.

01:39:27.447 --> 01:39:29.416
But make sure he has a view.

01:41:10.549 --> 01:41:12.183
What the hell
are these things?

01:41:12.185 --> 01:41:14.020
The Trench! We're here!

01:41:16.555 --> 01:41:18.490
- There are too many of them!
- Come on, inside!

01:41:28.968 --> 01:41:30.033
They're from the depths.

01:41:30.035 --> 01:41:31.704
They're scared
of the light. Here!

01:41:44.049 --> 01:41:45.451
Come on!

01:41:50.155 --> 01:41:51.523
You ready to jump?

01:43:00.426 --> 01:43:02.061
Over there!

01:43:36.694 --> 01:43:38.694
That thing
will tear us apart.

01:43:38.696 --> 01:43:40.531
We don't have a choice!

01:44:00.451 --> 01:44:02.153
Arthur!

01:44:05.423 --> 01:44:06.624
Mera!

01:44:37.854 --> 01:44:38.922
Mera!

01:44:40.057 --> 01:44:41.058
Mera!

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:03.915
Mera!

01:45:06.918 --> 01:45:07.919
Mera!

01:45:52.162 --> 01:45:53.331
Arthur.

01:45:54.231 --> 01:45:55.632
Mom?

01:46:33.802 --> 01:46:38.540
King Orvax sacrificed
me to the Trench, but I survived.

01:46:38.542 --> 01:46:42.009
I fought my way through as you
did, and I ended up here.

01:46:42.011 --> 01:46:43.844
You've been here
alone for 20 years?

01:46:43.846 --> 01:46:45.313
Yes.

01:46:45.315 --> 01:46:46.815
Come. Sit here.

01:46:51.720 --> 01:46:54.323
You must forgive me.

01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:56.958
Forgive me for everything.

01:46:56.960 --> 01:46:59.461
This happened
because you had me.

01:46:59.463 --> 01:47:04.332
Not for having you.
None of this is your fault.

01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:07.235
I made a choice.
I had to leave...

01:47:07.237 --> 01:47:11.341
To save you,
to save your father.

01:47:13.743 --> 01:47:16.313
Tell me. Tell me about him.

01:47:16.746 --> 01:47:18.148
Is he...

01:47:21.918 --> 01:47:24.387
He still walks
to the end of that dock.

01:47:26.223 --> 01:47:27.257
Every morning.

01:47:30.293 --> 01:47:31.760
Every day.

01:47:34.863 --> 01:47:36.366
Waiting for you.

01:47:43.973 --> 01:47:45.508
Why didn't you ever come back?

01:47:51.046 --> 01:47:55.283
Because the portal that brought
you here won't let us return.

01:47:55.285 --> 01:47:58.919
The trident
is the only way back.

01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:02.958
But it is guarded
by the Karathen.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.729
The creature from our legends,
it's real.

01:48:07.731 --> 01:48:10.866
It lies beyond the waterfall.

01:48:14.937 --> 01:48:17.271
We'll go with you.
We can fight it together.

01:48:17.273 --> 01:48:18.640
No.

01:48:18.642 --> 01:48:20.474
It's too powerful.

01:48:20.476 --> 01:48:24.311
I've tried many times
over the years.

01:48:24.313 --> 01:48:27.916
The creature will only allow
the true king to pass.

01:48:30.818 --> 01:48:32.454
You're afraid.

01:48:35.224 --> 01:48:36.292
Yes.

01:48:37.792 --> 01:48:39.094
Good.

01:48:40.629 --> 01:48:42.031
You're ready.

01:48:43.299 --> 01:48:45.167
Atlantis has always
had a king.

01:48:46.934 --> 01:48:49.136
Now, it needs something more.

01:48:49.138 --> 01:48:51.273
But what could be
greater than a king?

01:48:51.774 --> 01:48:53.041
A hero.

01:48:54.810 --> 01:48:57.212
A king fights
only for his nation.

01:48:58.981 --> 01:49:01.250
You fight for everyone.

01:50:29.805 --> 01:50:35.574
You do not belong here.

01:50:35.576 --> 01:50:42.148
I have guarded the trident against
false kings since the beginning.

01:50:42.150 --> 01:50:44.550
And for a thousand years

01:50:44.552 --> 01:50:50.356
I have seen the greatest
champions try and fail.

01:50:50.358 --> 01:50:56.897
But never have I sensed one
as unworthy as you.

01:50:56.899 --> 01:51:04.136
You dare come here with
your tainted mongrel blood

01:51:04.138 --> 01:51:07.674
to claim Atlantis'
greatest treasure?

01:51:09.977 --> 01:51:11.212
So be it...

01:51:12.614 --> 01:51:14.382
Half-breed.

01:51:33.869 --> 01:51:37.069
You thought yourself worthy?

01:51:37.071 --> 01:51:40.206
You thought yourself a king?

01:51:40.208 --> 01:51:44.610
You dishonor this place
with your presence.

01:51:44.612 --> 01:51:45.713
Stop!

01:51:53.287 --> 01:51:57.957
You're right.
I am a half-breed mongrel.

01:51:57.959 --> 01:52:00.893
But I did not come here
because I thought I was worthy.

01:52:00.895 --> 01:52:02.795
I know I'm not.

01:52:02.797 --> 01:52:06.866
You understand me?

01:52:06.868 --> 01:52:08.634
I do.

01:52:08.636 --> 01:52:15.443
No mortal has conversed
with me since King Atlan.

01:52:16.544 --> 01:52:19.747
Who are you?

01:52:20.548 --> 01:52:22.015
I'm nobody.

01:52:24.217 --> 01:52:27.087
I came because
I had no choice.

01:52:28.555 --> 01:52:33.159
I came to save my home
and the people that I love.

01:52:35.262 --> 01:52:39.364
I came because the trident
is their only hope.

01:52:39.366 --> 01:52:41.568
And if that's not
good enough...

01:52:44.005 --> 01:52:45.572
Then screw you.

01:52:47.507 --> 01:52:54.549
No man has ever freed
the trident from Atlan's grip.

01:52:55.383 --> 01:52:58.584
Should he deem you unworthy...

01:52:58.586 --> 01:53:03.956
Well, I haven't feasted
in eons,

01:53:03.958 --> 01:53:07.160
and I am famished.

01:54:37.050 --> 01:54:40.219
The one true king.

01:54:52.564 --> 01:54:55.700
Remember, the Brine
are powerful, savage brutes,

01:54:55.702 --> 01:55:00.238
but a swift assault aimed directly at
their leadership will turn the tide.

01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:02.073
Defeat the Brine King,

01:55:02.075 --> 01:55:05.745
and you will command the greatest
military might on this planet.

01:55:07.614 --> 01:55:09.616
Today, we unite our kingdoms.

01:55:11.284 --> 01:55:12.886
Tomorrow,
we scorch the surface!

01:55:14.186 --> 01:55:17.590
Rise, Atlantis!

01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:38.678
Death to the
Atlantean hagfish!

01:55:43.883 --> 01:55:46.184
We will not bow to Atlantis.

01:55:46.186 --> 01:55:50.723
We're gonna give them a fight
that they will never forget!

01:56:57.157 --> 01:56:59.958
No! We need him!

01:57:02.162 --> 01:57:03.760
Join me or die.

01:57:03.762 --> 01:57:07.330
You expect me to address
you as Your Highness?

01:57:07.332 --> 01:57:08.767
Not Your Highness.

01:57:10.769 --> 01:57:12.337
Call me...

01:57:13.038 --> 01:57:14.738
Ocean Master.

01:57:14.740 --> 01:57:18.642
You can take my army,
you soft-bellied slug.

01:57:18.644 --> 01:57:22.212
But you will never
have my allegiance!

01:57:22.214 --> 01:57:23.482
So be it!

01:57:55.346 --> 01:57:56.681
What the...

01:58:31.983 --> 01:58:33.718
The king has risen.

01:58:41.325 --> 01:58:43.493
Attack!

02:00:42.245 --> 02:00:44.946
There are too many casualties.
We have to stop the fighting now.

02:00:44.948 --> 02:00:48.284
I'll find my father.
But you must defeat Orm.

02:00:49.618 --> 02:00:51.185
And what if I can't?

02:00:51.187 --> 02:00:54.423
Last time,
he was in his element.

02:00:54.425 --> 02:00:57.627
This time,
make him fight in yours.

02:01:24.554 --> 02:01:26.488
Um...

02:01:26.490 --> 02:01:29.759
- What was the plan, again?
- The plan is to not get killed.

02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:33.596
Yeah, good plan.
Don't get killed.

02:02:06.529 --> 02:02:08.563
The Trench!
He commands the Trench!

02:02:08.565 --> 02:02:10.066
Impossible!

02:02:26.915 --> 02:02:28.648
Stand down! Let her pass.

02:02:28.650 --> 02:02:31.852
Please, Father,
he has the trident.

02:02:31.854 --> 02:02:34.221
I know you think
this war is necessary,

02:02:34.223 --> 02:02:36.790
but Arthur is king
by our most sacred law.

02:02:36.792 --> 02:02:38.459
And if you turn your back
on that now,

02:02:38.461 --> 02:02:40.760
then the Atlantis you're
fighting for is already dead.

02:02:40.762 --> 02:02:43.830
It's true!
The half-breed wields King Atlan's trident.

02:02:43.832 --> 02:02:45.100
He commands the sea!

02:02:47.169 --> 02:02:49.238
Then that half-breed
is your king.

02:04:06.381 --> 02:04:08.882
Vulko! Come on,
he needs our help!

02:04:08.884 --> 02:04:10.783
We can't! Look.

02:04:10.785 --> 02:04:12.421
The people must bear witness.

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:21.029
That trident
doesn't change what you are.

02:04:21.929 --> 02:04:23.465
A half-breed bastard.

02:04:26.067 --> 02:04:29.404
Atlantis will never accept you
as its king.

02:04:32.106 --> 02:04:33.475
Well, then by bloodshed...

02:04:35.711 --> 02:04:37.745
Do the gods
make known their will.

02:05:07.175 --> 02:05:09.478
Yield the throne. Yield it!

02:06:45.305 --> 02:06:46.505
Finish it.

02:06:46.507 --> 02:06:47.872
Yield the throne.

02:06:47.874 --> 02:06:49.643
Mercy is not our way.

02:06:51.244 --> 02:06:53.381
Maybe you haven't
noticed, brother...

02:06:58.854 --> 02:07:00.720
But I'm not one of you.

02:07:00.722 --> 02:07:01.956
Do it!

02:07:04.191 --> 02:07:06.193
- Kill me!
- No!

02:07:08.830 --> 02:07:10.531
That is enough killing.

02:07:18.005 --> 02:07:19.373
Mother?

02:07:19.907 --> 02:07:21.575
Oh, my son.

02:07:30.718 --> 02:07:32.851
It's a long story.

02:07:32.853 --> 02:07:34.388
I'll tell ya later.

02:07:35.356 --> 02:07:36.624
Come on!

02:07:43.163 --> 02:07:46.331
I don't understand.
We thought...

02:07:46.333 --> 02:07:47.334
I know.

02:07:47.902 --> 02:07:49.703
Arthur saved me.

02:07:53.406 --> 02:07:55.676
- You're with him?
- I am.

02:07:58.244 --> 02:08:03.347
You're both my children,
and I love you so much.

02:08:03.349 --> 02:08:05.585
But you have been misguided.

02:08:06.953 --> 02:08:11.022
Your father taught you
that there were two worlds.

02:08:11.024 --> 02:08:12.891
He was wrong.

02:08:12.893 --> 02:08:15.628
The land and the sea

02:08:16.931 --> 02:08:18.465
are one.

02:08:38.451 --> 02:08:39.586
My queen.

02:08:42.689 --> 02:08:44.056
Vulko.

02:08:46.359 --> 02:08:48.158
Take him.

02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:50.497
But make sure he has a view.

02:08:57.505 --> 02:08:58.506
When you're ready,

02:09:00.908 --> 02:09:02.308
let's talk.

02:09:16.957 --> 02:09:21.092
People of Atlantis,
today began in bloodshed,

02:09:21.094 --> 02:09:24.061
but let it end in joy.

02:09:24.063 --> 02:09:28.599
I give you
King Arthur of Atlantis.

02:09:28.601 --> 02:09:30.301
Hail to the king!

02:09:30.303 --> 02:09:33.337
- Hail to the king!
- Hail to the king!

02:09:41.381 --> 02:09:43.716
So, what do I do now?

02:09:44.317 --> 02:09:46.118
Be their king.

02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.686
Ooh.

02:09:48.688 --> 02:09:50.790
This is gonna be fun.

02:10:42.808 --> 02:10:45.709
You came back. You're back.

02:10:45.711 --> 02:10:47.813
Yes. Yes.

02:10:53.686 --> 02:10:56.589
<i>My father
was a lighthouse keeper.</i>

02:10:57.390 --> 02:10:59.459
<i>My mother was a queen.</i>

02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.729
<i>They were never
meant to meet...</i>

02:11:06.231 --> 02:11:08.635
<i>But their love
saved the world.</i>

02:11:10.837 --> 02:11:13.436
<i>They made me what I am.</i>

02:11:13.438 --> 02:11:17.142
<i>A son of the land,
and a king of the seas.</i>

02:11:18.711 --> 02:11:20.747
<i>I am the protector
of the deep.</i>

02:11:22.547 --> 02:11:23.615
<i>I am...</i>

02:11:25.283 --> 02:11:27.252
<i>Aquaman.</i>

02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:37.507
Hey!

02:14:41.444 --> 02:14:42.978
<i>I spent 15 years</i>

02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:45.346
<i>at the United States Institute
of Marine Science...</i>

02:14:45.348 --> 02:14:48.516
- <i>Weren't you fired?</i>
- <i>...studying oceanic phenomenon,</i>

02:14:48.518 --> 02:14:50.885
<i>and this is the most conclusive
evidence we have to date.</i>

02:14:50.887 --> 02:14:54.456
<i>Deep-sea seismographs have recorded
explosions on the ocean floor.</i>

02:14:54.458 --> 02:14:56.658
<i>We have satellite imagery</i>

02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:59.027
<i>of debris from Atlantean warships
floating on the surface...</i>

02:14:59.029 --> 02:15:00.829
- <i>Dr. Shin!</i>
- <i>Will you please let me finish?</i>

02:15:00.831 --> 02:15:03.065
<i>Here we go again.
Atlantean?</i>

02:15:03.067 --> 02:15:05.834
<i>Yes. The government
does not want us to know</i>

02:15:05.836 --> 02:15:07.402
<i>about the threat
that exists right here...</i>

02:15:07.404 --> 02:15:09.738
Yeah, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

02:15:21.986 --> 02:15:23.919
This is Atlantean technology,
isn't it?

02:15:23.921 --> 02:15:26.054
Can you tell me
how you got this?

02:15:26.056 --> 02:15:29.423
Sure. But first,

02:15:29.425 --> 02:15:32.395
you gotta tell me
how to find him.

02:15:37.084 --> 02:15:42.084
