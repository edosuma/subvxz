00:02.569 --> 00:04.264
The thing I admire
about the Chinese...

00:05.839 --> 00:07.739
...is they're hanging in there
with the chopsticks.

00:08.108 --> 00:11.509
Because if you think about it,
they've seen the fork by now.

00:12.078 --> 00:17.209
I'm sure they've seen the spoon.
They're going, "Yeah, they're okay.

00:17.384 --> 00:19.909
We're gonna stay with the sticks."

00:20.420 --> 00:22.479
I mean, I don't know how
they missed it.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.987
Thousands of years ago,
Chinese farmer gets up...

00:25.158 --> 00:27.092
...has his breakfast
with the chopsticks...

00:27.260 --> 00:31.390
...goes out and works all day
in the field with a shovel.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.054
Hello?

00:33.233 --> 00:35.030
Shovel?

00:35.869 --> 00:39.999
Not going out there plowing 40 acres
with a couple of pool cues.

00:45.912 --> 00:47.504
Good shave today.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.375
Don't worry,
I can manage these bags.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.914
Really, I'm fine.

00:51.084 --> 00:53.143
I'm thinking of letting
my sideburns grow in.

00:53.319 --> 00:54.547
Can we rest here a second?

00:55.622 --> 00:57.715
Yeah, I guess.

00:59.659 --> 01:02.150
-So how's Noreen?
-She got a new boyfriend. Paul.

01:02.328 --> 01:04.090
Already? That was fast.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.822
I assume he's not a high-talker.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.490
No, but he has the worst habit.

01:08.668 --> 01:11.398
Whenever he answers the phone,
he won't put Noreen right on.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.630
You have to go through 10 minutes
of chit-chat.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.139
-A long-talker.
-Yeah.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.436
He is so boring.

01:18.611 --> 01:20.909
Now whenever he answers the phone,
I just hang up.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.181
All right, let's move it out.

01:25.952 --> 01:28.216
Hey, isn't that George's father?

01:28.388 --> 01:30.754
Oh, yeah, it is.
Should we say hello?

01:30.924 --> 01:35.088
I've never seen him in Manhattan
before. It's weird. It's so out of context.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.763
That man he's with...

01:38.198 --> 01:40.792
...is he wearing a cape?

01:41.201 --> 01:43.465
I believe he is wearing a cape.

01:45.105 --> 01:48.199
Why is Mr. Costanza
with a man in a cape?

01:48.374 --> 01:51.468
Well, it is good cape weather.
Cool, breezy.

01:51.644 --> 01:54.511
Why a cape? Who wears a cape?

01:54.681 --> 01:56.911
Where do you even get a cape?

01:57.083 --> 01:58.846
You're right, it is strange.

01:59.018 --> 02:01.885
In fact, let's cross to the other side
of the street.

02:02.355 --> 02:04.619
Cover me.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.259
Just plop it on the counter there.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.067
Oh, I got a message.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.168
<i>Hey, it's George.</i>

02:23.343 --> 02:25.277
<i>I got nothing to say.</i>

02:27.247 --> 02:28.976
That sounds urgent.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.014
Let me call him back.

02:32.118 --> 02:33.608
Hello?

02:33.786 --> 02:35.185
Who is this?

02:35.355 --> 02:37.050
Donna Chang?

02:37.223 --> 02:39.657
I'm sorry. I must have dialed
the wrong number.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.815
Donna Chang?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.689
Should've talked.
I love Chinese women.

02:42.862 --> 02:44.989
Isn't that a little racist?

02:45.165 --> 02:49.363
If I like their race,
how can that be racist?

02:52.272 --> 02:53.705
Hello?

02:53.873 --> 02:55.966
Oh, is this Donna Chang again?

02:56.142 --> 02:58.508
Yes, I am calling George.

02:58.678 --> 03:01.670
Oh, the lines are crossed.
You're getting his calls.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.941
Well, what do you know.

03:04.651 --> 03:05.879
-Hi.
-So listen....

03:06.052 --> 03:08.748
I'm going through this stuff
like water.

03:09.923 --> 03:12.391
-Who are you talking to?
-He's on with a Chinese woman.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.618
You know, I dig Asian women.

03:17.664 --> 03:20.132
You got a comfort problem there?

03:20.833 --> 03:22.596
No, I think these Jockeys shrunk.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.971
-I thought you wore silk underwear.
-No.

03:26.139 --> 03:28.630
I wore them for a month,
but I couldn't stick with it.

03:28.808 --> 03:32.039
I need the secure packaging
of Jockeys.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.613
My boys need a house.

03:40.653 --> 03:42.518
That's nice.

03:43.256 --> 03:46.054
Listen, if you ever wanna have kids,
you shouldn't wear briefs.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.194
Boxers are much better
for your sperm count.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.319
Sperm count?

03:50.496 --> 03:52.794
Well, how many sperm
should I have?

03:52.966 --> 03:55.196
A lot.

03:55.368 --> 03:57.233
I got a date.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.394
-With the Chinese woman?
-She knew who I was.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.164
She saw me at a club one time.

04:01.341 --> 04:04.902
My first date ever with the Pacific Rim.
I'm very excited.

04:05.345 --> 04:08.007
Jerry, you ever have
your sperm count checked?

04:08.181 --> 04:10.911
No, why should l? I wear boxers.

04:11.551 --> 04:13.075
You ever get a woman pregnant?

04:13.253 --> 04:16.279
I'm sorry, Kramer. Those records
are permanently sealed.

04:16.456 --> 04:20.119
What would you say if I told you
I never impregnated a woman?

04:20.293 --> 04:21.521
Really?

04:21.694 --> 04:24.254
You never slipped one past the goalie
in all these years?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.526
I'm surprised.
You've slept with a lot of women.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.396
A lot of women!

04:32.205 --> 04:33.729
Do you think maybe I'm...

04:33.906 --> 04:35.931
...depleted?

04:36.109 --> 04:38.543
Well, I'm sure you're not
totally depleted.

04:38.711 --> 04:41.646
But what if I am?
I'm the last male Kramer.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.509
We're facing extinction.

04:43.683 --> 04:46.049
Go to a fertility clinic,
check your sperm count.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.779
Yeah, but then I'd have to--
Well, you know....

04:48.955 --> 04:51.788
Into a cup in the middle of the day?

04:51.958 --> 04:54.620
What, does that conflict
with your regular schedule?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.199
All right, I'm gonna try
Noreen again.

05:01.367 --> 05:05.167
I am very excited about this date.
We're going to Hunan Balcony.

05:05.338 --> 05:08.307
She's Chinese,
so you suggest Chinese food?

05:08.474 --> 05:11.272
-She suggested it.
-I thought Chinese don't eat Chinese.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.969
She's very assimilated.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.012
<i>Hello.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:21.309
-Paul again?
-You can't get one ring past him.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.656
-Hey, hey. You don't call me back?
-I tried.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.759
Your line's crossed
with a Chinese woman.

05:28.895 --> 05:33.093
Hey, George, we saw your father
on the street before.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.734
What's he doing in the city today?

05:35.902 --> 05:37.665
You didn't ask him?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.441
-You didn't say hello?
-Well, he was with someone...

05:43.609 --> 05:46.908
...a man in a cape.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.708
Why was he wearing a cape?

05:52.418 --> 05:55.012
Was my father wearing a cape?

05:55.188 --> 05:57.247
No, jacket and tie. No cape.

05:59.492 --> 06:01.585
A cape.

06:02.261 --> 06:05.719
What was a man with a cape
doing with my father?

06:05.898 --> 06:09.231
What was my father doing
with a man in a cape?

06:10.803 --> 06:13.237
Why a cape?

06:20.113 --> 06:22.411
The results of your sperm test
are in.

06:23.916 --> 06:26.214
Are you planning to start a family?

06:27.120 --> 06:29.987
Yes, I would like to very much.

06:30.156 --> 06:32.021
I'm low, aren't l? I can feel it.

06:32.625 --> 06:36.823
-Yes, I'm afraid you're a little low.
-Oh, man!

06:37.296 --> 06:39.264
It's over.
The Kramer name is finished.

06:39.432 --> 06:42.230
-I'm never gonna procreate, huh?
-That's not necessarily true.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.996
There are measures you can take
to improve your fertility.

06:45.171 --> 06:48.436
All right, what? What? You tell me.
I'll do anything. Come on, tell me.

06:48.608 --> 06:52.135
First thing,
you should wear boxer shorts.

06:53.479 --> 06:55.709
-All the time?
-All the time.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.009
You have to get off Jockeys
right away.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.812
But I've always worn Jockeys.

07:04.924 --> 07:08.257
Hi, Paul, it's Elaine calling.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.625
Yeah, I'm calling from a car phone,
so I don't really have time to talk.

07:11.798 --> 07:14.460
Is Noreen there?

07:14.634 --> 07:15.896
Oh, she's not? Okay, great.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.332
Well, you can just tell her
I called then, and--

07:20.206 --> 07:24.438
Well, yes, it has been
unseasonably cool lately.

07:26.879 --> 07:31.043
Okay. Well, look, I'm pulling up
to the building now, so I'm gonna....

07:31.918 --> 07:34.853
Yeah, I tip 20 percent too.

07:37.089 --> 07:40.718
Lookit, Paul, the car seems to be
running out of gas...

07:40.893 --> 07:44.727
...so I'm gonna have
to get off the phone.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.032
Please let me know
when your party has arrived.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.193
Yes, I will.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.167
-You mind?
-No, go ahead.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.900
I secondhand smoke
two packs a day.

07:58.244 --> 07:59.609
Jerry.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.544
-Excuse me?
-Hi, sorry I'm late.

08:03.716 --> 08:06.480
-Who are you?
-I'm Donna Chang.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.421
What do you mean?

08:10.590 --> 08:12.683
I mean I'm Donna Chang.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.058
You're Donna Chang?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.588
Did you think I was Chinese?

08:18.698 --> 08:21.098
No. What, you mean
because of the "Chang"?

08:21.267 --> 08:23.428
Actually, the family name
wasn't originally Chang.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.764
-I didn't think so.
-Used to be "Changstein."

08:28.674 --> 08:32.075
-She's not Chinese?
-No, not Chinese.

08:32.745 --> 08:34.269
Not even Asian.

08:34.813 --> 08:38.306
-So, what is she?
-Well, she's like you.

08:39.818 --> 08:42.616
Oh, how disappointed
you must have been.

08:43.722 --> 08:45.418
Well, it's false advertising, see?

08:45.591 --> 08:49.220
And the thing is, I think she likes
people thinking she's Chinese.

08:49.395 --> 08:51.090
She suggests Chinese food...

08:51.264 --> 08:53.528
...she always introduces herself
as Donna Chang.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.523
So why are you seeing her again?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.862
Well, she is a woman.

08:58.304 --> 09:01.273
Listen, I spoke to Paul and Noreen.
They might be breaking up.

09:01.807 --> 09:03.707
-Really?
-Well, maybe.

09:05.444 --> 09:07.912
Hey, wouldn't it be funny
if Paul and Noreen broke up...

09:08.080 --> 09:10.173
...because you kept
hanging up on him?

09:11.684 --> 09:14.744
-What do you mean?
-lf Paul thought it was some guy...

09:14.921 --> 09:18.254
...hanging up because he was
having an affair with Noreen.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.925
Here, take my Jockey shorts.

09:23.963 --> 09:25.396
Hey, what is that?

09:25.765 --> 09:28.825
Look, you gotta help me.
I have to get off Jockey shorts.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.333
-What, you have low sperm count?
-Very low.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.267
-Come on, take them.
-I don't want them.

09:33.439 --> 09:37.170
Jerry, look, you gotta help. If I have
one pair in my house, I'll wear them.

09:37.343 --> 09:39.607
-I don't want them.
-All it takes is one pair.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.339
I'm not gonna be able to sleep
if those are in the house.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.540
Boxers! How do you
wear these things?

09:44.717 --> 09:47.242
Look at that. They're bagging up.
They're rising here.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.583
And there's nothing holding me
in place. I'm flipping, I'm flopping.

09:53.292 --> 09:54.953
What am I gonna do?

09:55.127 --> 09:57.925
Jerry, I'm going crazy
in these things.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.928
Well, I'm gonna have to move now.

10:09.241 --> 10:11.209
You know what I like
about Manhattan?

10:12.311 --> 10:13.903
There's no mosquitoes.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.445
There's plenty of mosquitoes.

10:16.749 --> 10:18.410
Queens is full of mosquitoes.

10:18.584 --> 10:23.044
-So, Dad--
-Gnats, too, if I'm not mistaken.

10:26.659 --> 10:28.456
Heard you were in the city
the other day.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.291
Your mother has to tell you
every move I make? I'll kill her.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.966
-Jerry and Elaine saw you.
-They didn't say hello?

10:37.136 --> 10:40.128
-They were in a rush.
-They couldn't just say hello?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.297
Ah, the hell with them.

10:42.875 --> 10:47.141
They said you were with some guy
who was wearing a cape.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.577
Elaine, I can see not saying hello.

10:49.749 --> 10:53.241
She's very--
What's the word? Supercilious.

10:53.419 --> 10:56.980
-So, Dad--
-How could Jerry not say hello?

11:01.093 --> 11:03.857
-Did they uncross the lines yet?
-They can't find the problem.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.395
It's really getting ridicurous.

11:07.000 --> 11:13.074

11:27.053 --> 11:29.351
Did you say "ridicurous"?

11:29.889 --> 11:31.117
Ridiculous.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.386
I thought you said...

11:35.561 --> 11:37.358
...ridicurous.

11:40.933 --> 11:42.264
Hey, what are you doing here?

11:42.435 --> 11:44.926
I wanted to talk to you.
I didn't know you had company.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.969
-Oh, no, no.
-Hi, I'm George.

11:47.139 --> 11:50.108
-Oh, hi.
-I'm Donna Chang.

11:52.845 --> 11:54.813
I just spoke to your mother before.

11:55.514 --> 11:58.745
-You spoke to my mother?
-She was trying to call you, but--

11:58.918 --> 12:00.715
The rines are crossed.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.656
Did you say the "rines"
are crossed?

12:05.691 --> 12:07.215
Did l?

12:08.461 --> 12:11.259
George, she's so sweet.
We talked for an hour.

12:11.430 --> 12:13.227
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.959
Sorry, why sorry? What do you
have to be sorry about?

12:16.135 --> 12:19.502
Well, she told me she and your father
are getting divorced.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.516
Boy, divorced. That's really too bad.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.555
Yeah. You know,
it's a shame his parents...

12:39.725 --> 12:42.193
...didn't get divorced 30 years ago.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.160
He could've been normal.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.897
Oh, my God!

12:48.667 --> 12:50.396
You know what I just realized?

12:50.569 --> 12:53.265
If they get divorced
and live in two separate places...

12:53.439 --> 12:55.600
...that's twice as many visits.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.140
I never thought of that.

12:57.309 --> 12:59.607
Imagine if I had to see them both
on the same day.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.509
It's like running a double marathon.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.816
Hey, Georgie, did you have any idea
that anything was wrong?

13:06.986 --> 13:09.978
Have you ever spent any time
with these people?

13:12.324 --> 13:14.485
-You know what this has to do with?
-What?

13:14.660 --> 13:18.096
The man in the cape. I bet you
he is mixed up in this.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.832
I don't trust men in capes.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.797
You can't cast
dispersions on someone...

13:22.968 --> 13:25.027
...just because
they're wearing a cape.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.502
Superman wore a cape.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.971
And I'll be damned
if I'm gonna stand here...

13:30.142 --> 13:32.337
...and let you say
something bad about him.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.103
All right, Superman's the exception.

13:38.751 --> 13:41.720
Hey, Elaine, I just heard that
Noreen and Paul are breaking up.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.684
I want you to put in
a good word for me.

13:43.856 --> 13:45.255
Always had a thing for Noreen.

13:45.424 --> 13:48.222
No, Kramer, you don't understand,
this could be my fault.

13:48.394 --> 13:52.330
Well, if she's available, I won't let
her slip through my fingers this time.

13:55.234 --> 13:57.429
Well, looks like you've adjusted
to the boxers.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.434
Well, I wouldn't go as far as that.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.574
-You went back to the Jockeys?
-Wrong again.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.977
Oh, no.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.612
What? What?

14:12.051 --> 14:14.849
Don't you see
what's going on here?

14:15.321 --> 14:17.448
No boxers, no Jockeys.

14:21.260 --> 14:25.253
The only thing between him and us
is a thin layer of gabardine.

14:26.465 --> 14:28.524
-Kramer, say it isn't so.
-Oh, it be so.

14:30.236 --> 14:34.195
I'm out there, Jerry,
and I'm loving every minute of it!

14:38.544 --> 14:40.239
Don't you need a little help?

14:40.412 --> 14:41.709
Surprisingly, no.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.781
I'm free. I'm unfettered.

14:46.418 --> 14:50.047
I feel like a naked, innocent boy
roaming the countryside.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.391
So you guys are trying to work it out.
That's great.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.929
Yeah, well, we're trying, but he just
went insane there for a while.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.793
He went insane?

15:00.966 --> 15:02.627
Believe it or not...

15:02.801 --> 15:04.860
...Paul was convinced
I was having an affair...

15:05.037 --> 15:08.131
...because somebody kept calling and
hanging up whenever he answered.

15:09.108 --> 15:13.738
What kind of a sick person calls
and hangs up over and over?

15:14.113 --> 15:15.978
Well...

15:16.148 --> 15:17.843
...I don't know about sick.

15:18.017 --> 15:21.009
I mean, maybe it was somebody...

15:21.186 --> 15:23.882
...who didn't wanna talk
to whoever was answering...

15:24.056 --> 15:27.753
...because whoever was answering
was always making boring chit-chat...

15:27.927 --> 15:30.191
...and was completely oblivious
to the fact...

15:30.362 --> 15:34.856
...that the person who was calling
didn't wanna speak to them.

15:38.237 --> 15:42.139
I can't believe that was you.

15:42.541 --> 15:44.771
I'm really sorry, Noreen.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.839
So you thought he was boring?

15:48.514 --> 15:51.483
Hey, Noreen, don't go by me.

15:54.386 --> 15:55.853
What are you doing to this woman?

15:56.322 --> 16:00.315
This is the second relationship
you've ruined for her in a few weeks.

16:01.026 --> 16:02.960
-I know.
-First you ruin her relationship...

16:03.128 --> 16:05.926
-...with the high-talker.
-Well, I got confused.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.690
They sound exactly the same.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.299
So she breaks up with him.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.629
Somehow picks up
the pieces of her life...

16:11.804 --> 16:14.864
...miraculously meets a new guy.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.474
You bust that up.

16:17.643 --> 16:22.012
And then just as they're reconciling,
you announce to the world...

16:22.181 --> 16:24.809
...he's boring.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.876
I didn't know she'd take it
so seriously.

16:28.053 --> 16:30.715
Apparently, you have a tremendous
influence over this woman.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.982
Anything you say, she does.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.794
-Yeah?
-It's Donna Chang.

16:36.962 --> 16:40.295
-Come on up.
-I guess I just didn't realize it.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.900
Well, let's look back at your history
with this woman.

16:43.068 --> 16:45.161
-Okay?
-Okay.

16:45.337 --> 16:49.603
First, you encouraged her
to join the army.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.104
She did.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.904
She was lost.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.207
Then you suggest she goes AWOL.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.045
She did.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.278
Well, she didn't seem
to be having so much fun.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.752
Make sure you never tell this woman
to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.

17:05.924 --> 17:08.915
If I have this much influence,
I'll call her and tell her...

17:09.094 --> 17:10.891
...to get back together with him.

17:11.630 --> 17:13.393
-Hey.
-Oh, Miss Changstein.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.363
-This is Elaine.
-Hi. How are you?

17:16.535 --> 17:18.469
Guess what?
Mrs. Costanza called me.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.231
-They're not getting divorced.
-Why, what happened?

17:21.406 --> 17:23.840
She was trying to call George
last night, she got me...

17:24.009 --> 17:26.272
...we spoke for an hour,
and she changed her mind.

17:26.444 --> 17:29.039
-Wow, that's amazing.
-Anyway, she wants to meet me.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.739
She invited me over for dinner.
Said you should come too.

17:31.917 --> 17:33.043
-Tonight?
-Yeah.

17:33.218 --> 17:37.279
I just remembered. I'm gonna have
to cancel my acupuncture class.

17:45.264 --> 17:47.425
All right, let me just say one thing.

17:47.599 --> 17:50.159
There is no way that this
is gonna happen. No way!

17:50.335 --> 17:52.735
Because if you think I'm going
to two Thanksgivings...

17:52.905 --> 17:54.429
...you're out of your mind!

17:54.640 --> 17:57.803
-We're not getting divorced.
-Your mother changed her mind.

17:57.976 --> 18:01.070
You did? That's good.
That's very good.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.737
-I'm very glad to hear that.
-Yeah, we worked it out.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.976
All right, so let me ask you a question.
Who was the man in the cape?

18:07.152 --> 18:10.349
-He was my lawyer.
-Your lawyer wears a cape?

18:10.522 --> 18:12.251
Yeah. So what?

18:12.424 --> 18:15.086
-Who wears a cape?
-He's very independent.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.852
He doesn't follow the trends.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.861
He looks ridiculous in that thing.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.363
You have no eye for fashion!

18:21.533 --> 18:24.001
-I have no eye for fashion?
-All right.

18:24.169 --> 18:27.696
Come on. Let's not fight.

18:27.873 --> 18:29.636
-All right, all right.
-All right.

18:29.808 --> 18:31.776
Georgie's right.

18:32.978 --> 18:34.809
So, what made you change
your mind?

18:34.980 --> 18:38.211
It was that Chinese woman.

18:40.252 --> 18:42.777
What did you tell Mrs. Costanza
that changed her mind?

18:42.955 --> 18:45.719
Mentioned a few bits of wisdom
from Confucius.

18:45.891 --> 18:47.859
-Confucius, huh?
-Yeah.

18:49.094 --> 18:51.688
You know, you're not Chinese.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.500
Hey, I heard the good news.

18:57.669 --> 19:01.105
Jerry, how come you didn't
say hello to me the other day?

19:01.273 --> 19:04.572
-Elaine was in a rush.
-I knew it was Elaine.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.378
-You must be Estelle.
-Yes. Who are you?

19:09.548 --> 19:10.708
I'm Donna Chang.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.582
You're not Chinese.

19:17.122 --> 19:18.384
Hello?

19:18.557 --> 19:20.422
-Paul?
-Elaine.

19:20.759 --> 19:22.522
Kramer?

19:22.694 --> 19:24.662
Yeah!

19:26.231 --> 19:29.166
-What are you doing there?
-Well, isn't it obvious?

19:31.103 --> 19:34.402
-Is Noreen there?
<i>-Yes, she is.</i>

19:34.573 --> 19:37.235
Well, can I talk to her?

19:37.543 --> 19:39.773
What, am I too boring for you?

19:40.913 --> 19:42.210
Would you just put her on?

19:42.381 --> 19:45.680
I feel it would be best that you didn't
talk to Noreen for a while.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.785
-You feel?
<i>-That's right.</i>

19:47.953 --> 19:50.114
She and I have had a very long talk.

19:50.289 --> 19:53.156
And I was appalled to learn
of the destructive influence...

19:53.325 --> 19:57.421
...you've had over her life
lo these many years.

19:57.596 --> 20:01.532
-What, are you insane?
-From now on, I'll be calling the shots.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.032
And what are you gonna tell her?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.604
Well, I've encouraged her
to go back into the army.

20:08.140 --> 20:11.803
There she'll get the structure
and discipline she needs right now.

20:11.977 --> 20:16.209
And she'll have qualified officers
telling her what to do.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.816
Kramer, you have got
to let me talk to her.

20:19.985 --> 20:21.748
Can't help you, kid.

20:22.254 --> 20:24.814
-You're not Chinese?
-No.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.788
-I thought you were Chinese.
-I'm from Long Island.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.621
Long Island?

20:29.795 --> 20:32.958
I thought I was getting advice
from a Chinese woman.

20:33.131 --> 20:36.157
-I'm sorry.
-Well, then...

20:36.335 --> 20:39.634
-...that changes everything.
-What?

20:39.805 --> 20:43.036
She's not Chinese. I was duped!

20:44.076 --> 20:45.839
So what? She still gave you advice.

20:46.011 --> 20:47.478
What's the difference?

20:47.646 --> 20:51.343
I'm not taking advice
from some girl from Long Island.

20:51.683 --> 20:54.652
Now you're getting a divorce
because she's from Long Island?

20:54.820 --> 20:57.914
You want a divorce? You got one!

20:59.491 --> 21:02.858
You know, you might wanna think
about changing your name.

21:03.362 --> 21:06.195
Ever since she started dating Kramer,
she won't even talk to me.

21:06.365 --> 21:07.730
Well, Noreen listened to you...

21:07.899 --> 21:10.561
...like George's mother
listened to the Chinese.

21:10.736 --> 21:14.001
Everybody listens to the Chinese.
Look at the fortune cookie.

21:14.172 --> 21:16.538
You couldn't get away with that
at other restaurants.

21:16.708 --> 21:19.506
Yeah, no one's reading any
rolled up messages in a knish.

21:21.146 --> 21:25.173
Well, it had to happen. I knew it.
I predicted it.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.545
Saw both of them today.
What a disaster.

21:29.421 --> 21:31.013
I'm running all over Queens.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.282
First, I saw my mother.
We had lunch together.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.450
I never had lunch with my mother
before. It's like a date.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.893
Then we drive down to Kew Gardens,
tons of traffic, I see my father.

21:40.065 --> 21:41.760
We played Clue.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.230
All day with this!

21:43.402 --> 21:45.370
Hey, Jerry! Guess what?

21:45.537 --> 21:47.835
The Kramer name might live on!

21:48.006 --> 21:49.439
Noreen's late!

21:49.608 --> 21:52.509
She's late!

22:18.603 --> 22:21.538
-Who are you?
-I'm Frank Costanza's lawyer.
