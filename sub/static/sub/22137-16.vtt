30:14.710 --> 30:15.830
No.
Right now.

30:15.830 --> 30:17.290
Hey, Barry, listen.

30:17.290 --> 30:21.330
I know what it's like
to hate yourself,

30:21.330 --> 30:26.080
but I also know
that you are a good person.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.880
Tell me...

30:27.880 --> 30:29.750
how do you know?
I just do.

30:29.750 --> 30:33.500
And I can't explain it

30:33.500 --> 30:37.540
because there are these,
like -- It's rules stuff.

30:37.540 --> 30:41.920
But, um -- But you're more
important than you realize.

30:45.880 --> 30:46.920

30:49.210 --> 30:50.500
You're still
trippin' balls.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.080
Sure.
Okay.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.210
This...

31:05.210 --> 31:08.000
This is the most amazing
coffee ever.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.460
I know!
Tyler: All right.

31:09.460 --> 31:13.380
Pancakes for K-Rod,
and oatmeal for Crunch Barry.

31:13.380 --> 31:14.830
Thanks, Ty.

31:14.830 --> 31:17.000
No, thank you.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.790
Thought long and hard
about your advice,

31:18.790 --> 31:21.830
and you're totally right
about me and Becky.

31:21.830 --> 31:23.540
So you're not moving in
with her?

31:23.540 --> 31:24.960
Nope.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.540
She's moving in with me!

31:26.540 --> 31:27.620
And my mom!

31:27.620 --> 31:29.000
Oh.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.710
Yeah!
It just makes sense, you know?

31:30.710 --> 31:32.580
'Cause she's unemployed.

31:32.580 --> 31:34.750
I'm a waiter.
We can't afford a place.

Are you -- You're sure
about this, Ty?

31:39.670 --> 31:42.750
You know, I know a lot of people
think we're moving too fast.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.080
But it feels right.

31:44.080 --> 31:46.670

31:53.210 --> 31:54.210
You're the best.

31:54.210 --> 31:55.460
Oh, hey, real quick.

31:55.460 --> 31:56.790
What do you want me to do
with that dead body?

31:58.750 --> 31:59.960
Oh, my God.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.250
Tyler, could you possibly
fill us in

32:01.250 --> 32:02.420
on how this happened?

32:02.420 --> 32:03.920
Oh, my God.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.420
You guys came in after closing
wearing some fly kimonos.

32:07.420 --> 32:09.830
Asked me if I could store
a stiff, and I said "Sure."

32:09.830 --> 32:12.500
Um, did we say why?

32:12.500 --> 32:16.120
Just kept talking about doing
the right thing over and over.

32:16.120 --> 32:19.040
Okay, but the problem is,
the right thing

32:19.040 --> 32:21.000
wasn't what I thought
it was, so...

32:21.000 --> 32:22.790
what did I mean?

32:22.790 --> 32:24.540
Oh, it wasn't you.
It was Kev here.

32:24.540 --> 32:25.710
Yeah.

32:25.710 --> 32:28.170
He gave a pretty
rousing speech.

32:28.170 --> 32:30.460
What --
What did I say?

32:30.460 --> 32:32.080
I can't remember
exactly.

32:32.080 --> 32:34.460
Something like, uh...

32:34.460 --> 32:37.460
"Barry -- you didn't
learn the art

32:37.460 --> 32:40.040
of metatarsal
reflexology,

32:40.040 --> 32:42.250
steal a body,
dig a grave,

32:42.250 --> 32:44.540
decide not to bury that body
in the grave,

32:44.540 --> 32:47.920
and bring it to the diner
just to give up now.

32:47.920 --> 32:52.380
This is your chance --
perhaps your only chance --

32:52.380 --> 32:56.290
to do the right thing
and stand up to your family."

32:56.290 --> 32:58.460
Or something like that. I don't
know. My memory is not great.

32:58.460 --> 33:00.710
Wow.
No!
Tyler, you're right.

33:00.710 --> 33:02.750
Well, I was.
I was right because he was --

33:02.750 --> 33:04.120
Oh, you too, Kelvin.
Yeah, okay.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.250
You too.
I have to stand up to them

33:06.250 --> 33:08.710
and tell them that Gil's
getting his last wish.

33:08.710 --> 33:09.830
I'm doing it.

33:09.830 --> 33:11.290
Tyler: Great.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.500
I mean, they'll probably
be cool with the whole

33:13.500 --> 33:15.580
you guys stealing the body
and everything, right?

33:15.580 --> 33:17.790
Um...

Okay, what time is it?

Okay, you got to go to
your family right now

33:24.500 --> 33:27.460

Gil where he wants to be buried.

33:27.460 --> 33:29.670
Oh, I'll take Gil back to the
funeral home before it opens.

33:29.670 --> 33:31.620
I'll be in and out and they'll
never know who took the body.

33:31.620 --> 33:32.710
Okay. I'm going.

33:32.710 --> 33:34.830
Um, Ty, two things --

One, you have to throw out
everything you have in here.

33:37.330 --> 33:38.830

another thing.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.250
Or don't even think about
anything at all.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.460
Just no more thinking.

40:46.460 --> 40:48.540
Just a blank,
empty mind from now on.

40:48.540 --> 40:49.540
We need to talk.

40:49.540 --> 40:50.830
It's really not
a good time.

40:50.830 --> 40:52.210
Oh, I don't care.

40:52.210 --> 40:54.170
Who was that person on
my front porch this morning?

40:54.170 --> 40:56.790
And why does she look
exactly like the person
in my security footage?

40:56.790 --> 40:58.620
You know what?
I just --

40:58.620 --> 41:02.000
I-I want you to think about this
before you make something up.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.120
Okay.

41:04.120 --> 41:06.670
Aim, look, I know that
you're worried about me --

41:06.670 --> 41:08.170
No. I'm not worried
about you.

41:08.170 --> 41:10.830
I'm worried about me, okay?
I just -- I...

41:10.830 --> 41:12.290
I feel like I'm losing it.

41:12.290 --> 41:14.960
And I just -- I need --
I need the absolute truth.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.080
Fine.

41:19.290 --> 41:22.460
That meteor wasn't a meteor. It
was actually a warrior from God.

41:22.460 --> 41:24.290
Her name is Yvette, and she
was sent here to protect me

41:24.290 --> 41:25.960
because I was
the last righteous soul,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.920
and my mission is to anoint
new righteous souls

41:27.920 --> 41:29.210
and save the world.

41:32.250 --> 41:34.080
Wait. Did I say that?

41:34.080 --> 41:36.920
Did -- Did that come out
of my mouth?

41:36.920 --> 41:38.380
I did it.

41:38.380 --> 41:40.670
I -- Aim,
that was the truth!

41:40.670 --> 41:42.330
Wow.

41:42.330 --> 41:43.920
I feel like an idiot.

41:46.210 --> 41:47.790
I can't believe that
I actually thought

41:47.790 --> 41:49.120
you would say something
even remotely help--

41:49.120 --> 41:51.290
Yvette: Hello, Amy.

41:51.290 --> 41:53.460
Kevin's telling
the truth.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.000
I am a messenger
from God.

41:55.000 --> 41:56.380
Huh?

41:56.380 --> 41:58.920
And Kevin is one of
the 36 righteous souls

41:58.920 --> 42:01.210
who protects humanity
merely by existing.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.500
And...I know this
is a lot to take in,

42:06.500 --> 42:08.750
and under normal circumstances
I wouldn't burden you

42:08.750 --> 42:10.500
with this knowledge.

42:10.500 --> 42:12.420
But these aren't
normal circumstances.

42:14.500 --> 42:15.960
We need your help.
