00:00.991 --> 00:02.714
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.739 --> 00:04.739
Henry has moles
inside Langley,

00:04.841 --> 00:08.058
and Annie just discovered that
Seth Newman was one of them.

00:08.686 --> 00:10.353
He attacked Annie.

00:10.405 --> 00:12.522
It started at Seth's place.

00:12.573 --> 00:13.874
She had to act in self-defense.

00:15.793 --> 00:18.078
- Where's the body?
- Somewhere in the Potomac.

00:18.162 --> 00:20.130
Annie, I know what happened
on the bridge.

00:20.197 --> 00:21.832
You don't need to worry.

00:21.883 --> 00:24.634
You have my support,
whatever you need.

00:24.702 --> 00:28.505
Seth Newman was found
in Virginia, extremely dead.

00:28.556 --> 00:29.890
FBI is already on it.

00:29.974 --> 00:33.927
Rest assured that they
will solve this, soon enough.

00:42.236 --> 00:45.238
Alexandria police officially
handed Seth Newman's case

00:45.323 --> 00:48.525
over to the FBI the second
his body was I.D.'d.

00:48.576 --> 00:51.060
Why didn't Langley contain
the investigation?

00:51.112 --> 00:52.863
D.C.I. doesn't know
Seth was a mole,

00:52.914 --> 00:55.665
so he's pushing Feds
to follow this down.

00:55.733 --> 00:58.535
Right back to me.

00:58.586 --> 01:00.203
It was your life or Seth's.

01:00.254 --> 01:02.539
That defense may have
held water at the time,

01:02.590 --> 01:04.340
but what about our actions
after the fact?

01:04.408 --> 01:07.544
If people find out you removed
evidence from Seth's brownstone,

01:07.595 --> 01:10.180
you could go to jail.
Henry Wilcox used Seth

01:10.247 --> 01:12.599
to steal classified documents
out of Langley.

01:12.683 --> 01:15.418
We just exposed
a massive intelligence breach.

01:15.470 --> 01:17.187
With what to corroborate
our story?

01:17.254 --> 01:18.922
We've got nothing concrete.

01:18.973 --> 01:21.257
Forget concrete.
What do we have?

01:21.309 --> 01:22.392
The night Seth was killed,

01:22.443 --> 01:23.777
he was headed to deliver
a flash drive.

01:23.861 --> 01:26.062
I saw the envelope
in his jacket pocket.

01:26.113 --> 01:29.399
The flash drive could be
in FBI possession right now.

01:29.450 --> 01:32.268
That could prove a connection.
I can cry national security,

01:32.320 --> 01:34.371
bigfoot the Feds,
and they will be forced

01:34.438 --> 01:35.705
to hand the device to me.

01:35.773 --> 01:37.040
Have to do it without ruffling
Calder's feathers.

01:37.107 --> 01:39.493
We have to proceed
as if he's working for Henry.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.661
Well, that's the only way
to vindicate us--

01:41.746 --> 01:43.296
connect Seth and Henry.

01:43.381 --> 01:46.049
Without the flash drive, all we
have is conspiracy theory.

01:46.116 --> 01:49.419
Annie, I can insert you
into the FBI investigation

01:49.470 --> 01:52.622
as the CIA liaison,
but then it's up to you

01:52.673 --> 01:55.008
to get the flash drive.

01:55.092 --> 01:57.727
I can do that.

01:57.795 --> 02:00.230
Then I will make the call.

02:15.363 --> 02:17.163
Thank you.

02:25.122 --> 02:26.373
Miss Walker?

02:26.457 --> 02:28.491
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

02:28.543 --> 02:31.160
- You'll be working in here.
- Okay.

02:32.830 --> 02:35.098
Jogger discovered the body in
Belle Haven wildlife preserve.

02:35.165 --> 02:36.299
Uhhuh.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.001
This is
the responding officer's report.

02:38.052 --> 02:39.932
Quite detailed.
Guy can't spell for shit though.

02:41.355 --> 02:44.507
I need an inventory of the
personal effects discovered.

02:44.559 --> 02:47.444
Okay.

02:47.511 --> 02:48.845
Migraine hit

02:48.896 --> 02:52.515
the second I saw your name
on the sign-in sheet.

02:52.567 --> 02:53.650
Hello, Vincent.

02:53.701 --> 02:55.735
Oh, we're
on a first-name basis?

02:55.820 --> 02:57.954
After what you did to me
on the R.D.I. case

02:58.022 --> 03:00.707
or the Smithsonian break-in

03:00.791 --> 03:02.191
or the mess
with the Mossad guy?

03:02.243 --> 03:04.327
I was hoping
we could start over.

03:04.378 --> 03:06.379
Hmm.

03:06.464 --> 03:10.634
Forgive, don't forget.
I got this.

03:14.705 --> 03:17.173
There's one thing I've learned
from our past experience--

03:17.224 --> 03:19.726
you have a hidden agenda,
so save us both the headache.

03:19.810 --> 03:20.977
Why are you really here?

03:21.045 --> 03:24.481
A federal officer is dead,
one of our own.

03:24.548 --> 03:27.150
This is not the time to let
personal grudges get in the way.

03:32.607 --> 03:35.575
Let's get to work.

03:35.660 --> 03:36.726
Are you staying on?

03:36.777 --> 03:37.894
You wouldn't show your face

03:37.945 --> 03:39.496
unless there was something
bigger at stake.

03:39.563 --> 03:42.332
If you are involved
in this murder investigation,

03:42.399 --> 03:43.333
so am I.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.502
Sure it's a murder?

03:45.569 --> 03:48.371
Medical examiner confirmed
the ribs broke evenly,

03:48.422 --> 03:51.591
suggesting a fall
from some distance.

03:51.676 --> 03:53.176
Bruises to face and torso

03:53.243 --> 03:55.845
indicate the victim was involved
in a struggle

03:55.913 --> 03:59.933
shortly before he died,
so, yeah, looks like a murder.

04:01.018 --> 04:02.052
This is new to you, huh?

04:02.103 --> 04:04.054
You spooks rarely solve
the crime.

04:04.105 --> 04:05.855
You're too busy searching
for treasure

04:05.923 --> 04:07.223
and chasing assassins.

04:07.274 --> 04:09.258
You have
an active imagination.

04:09.310 --> 04:11.394
Really? Drones, waterboarding,
is that more accurate?

04:11.445 --> 04:12.762
Want to take a look?

04:12.813 --> 04:16.265
Okay.

04:16.317 --> 04:17.784
I already notified
the immediate family.

04:17.868 --> 04:21.538
Did you know him?

04:21.605 --> 04:22.622
I knew him.

04:22.707 --> 04:24.541
I didn't know him well.

04:24.608 --> 04:26.543
Well, the police
didn't find a wallet.

04:26.610 --> 04:30.279
- Any personal effects?
- Yeah.

04:30.331 --> 04:34.834
There was...change,

04:34.919 --> 04:37.303
keys, one shoe, pen.

04:37.388 --> 04:38.454
Anything else?

04:38.506 --> 04:40.289
You're looking
for something specific?

04:40.341 --> 04:42.792
Yeah,
a solid lead.

04:45.129 --> 04:48.014
Excuse me.

04:51.102 --> 04:53.269
We found traces of skin

04:53.320 --> 04:54.404
underneath
the victim's fingernails,

04:54.471 --> 04:57.640
probably the killer's.

04:57.692 --> 05:01.611
This is good news, right?

05:01.662 --> 05:04.614
The river
didn't wash it away?

05:04.665 --> 05:06.833
This <i>is</i> new to you.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.753
Guy was fighting
for his life,

05:09.820 --> 05:14.323
skin got trapped
deep underneath the nail bed.

05:15.509 --> 05:16.676
DNA is off to the lab.

05:16.761 --> 05:18.294
It's only a matter of time
before we catch

05:18.345 --> 05:21.297
whoever killed Seth Newman.

05:21.353 --> 05:24.853
<font color="#FF0000">4x06</font>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Space (I Believe In)</font>

05:24.854 --> 05:28.154
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00FF00>elderman</font> ==
<font color=#00FFFF>@elder_man</font>

05:28.155 --> 05:29.303
We got a problem.

05:29.304 --> 05:32.228
The FBI found traces of skin
underneath Seth's fingernails.

05:32.229 --> 05:34.808
That lab work is gonna take
weeks to process.

05:34.809 --> 05:37.111
In the meantime,
we'll figure something out.

05:37.162 --> 05:40.914
- Don't sugarcoat it.
- Keep calm, carry on.

05:40.982 --> 05:42.166
The plan remains the same.

05:42.250 --> 05:43.984
Focus on
the mission objective.

05:44.035 --> 05:46.587
Let me handle the rest.

05:51.209 --> 05:53.293
This morning you appointed
Annie Walker liaison

05:53.345 --> 05:55.629
to the FBI investigation.
That's my call.

05:55.680 --> 05:57.131
When Seth's death
was ruled a murder,

05:57.182 --> 05:59.600
it became D.C.S. purview.

05:59.667 --> 06:02.169
Moving forward,
all decisions go through me.

06:02.220 --> 06:05.055
You ever get tired
of the office politics, Joan?

06:05.140 --> 06:08.225
It's not my fault your boy
Auggie didn't get the job.

06:08.309 --> 06:09.676
My decision stems
from the fact

06:09.728 --> 06:13.113
that Seth was an officer
with top-level clearance...

06:13.181 --> 06:14.514
And a dear friend.

06:14.566 --> 06:16.183
Yes, I'm aware
of your personal relationship.

06:16.234 --> 06:20.020
One thing you need to know
about me is, I dig deep.

06:20.071 --> 06:21.991
Seth and I spent a year
together on Benelux desk.

06:22.023 --> 06:24.357
Our relationship
wasn't a secret.

06:24.409 --> 06:27.161
If I were you,
I'd focus on the case,

06:27.212 --> 06:28.495
not my personal life.

06:28.546 --> 06:29.630
As long as your personal life

06:29.697 --> 06:32.299
doesn't influence
the investigation.

06:32.366 --> 06:34.385
Annie was appointed
CIA liaison based on

06:34.469 --> 06:38.038
her long and effective working
relationship with the FBI.

06:39.924 --> 06:42.092
Is that so?

06:47.232 --> 06:49.549
The turn for Belle Haven is--
is this way.

06:49.601 --> 06:50.934
That's where the body
was discovered.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.187
I'm more concerned
with where the victim died.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.322
Called in a few favors
from my friends at ESRI.

06:55.389 --> 06:57.441
Water currents, flow charts,
tidal patterns--

06:57.525 --> 06:59.693
saved us three days
of pushing paper.

06:59.744 --> 07:02.079
The victim fell
from over 60 feet.

07:02.163 --> 07:03.997
That narrows the local bridges
down to three.

07:04.065 --> 07:07.367
Seth Newman lived
right around the corner.

07:07.419 --> 07:09.953
Seems like the place
to focus our efforts.

07:55.500 --> 07:59.219
Oh!

08:08.730 --> 08:10.931
Walker.

08:10.982 --> 08:13.734
Come here.

08:13.801 --> 08:16.303
See that?

08:16.354 --> 08:17.971
Blood.

08:18.022 --> 08:20.274
And there were cuts
on the victim's palms.

08:20.341 --> 08:22.576
Looks like he was holding on
before he fell.

08:26.314 --> 08:28.648
Go.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.251
No, we're still on the bridge.

08:32.669 --> 08:35.488
Don't do anything
until we get there.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.157
Good news?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.060
Nothing.

08:57.145 --> 08:59.563
Seems odd that a CIA lawyer
keeps an empty secret safe.

08:59.647 --> 09:02.733
Everything about this is odd.

09:02.817 --> 09:05.202
Webb, what about the sweep,
anything?

09:05.286 --> 09:07.654
No fingerprints,
not even the victim's.

09:07.705 --> 09:11.241
Nothing in the computer
hard drive, no files at all.

09:11.326 --> 09:13.526
Your people have anything
to do with this?

09:13.578 --> 09:15.829
No.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.748
All right, I want
the lab work fast-tracked,

09:17.832 --> 09:19.416
and you have the DNA results
on my desk

09:19.500 --> 09:22.252
within the next 48 hours.

09:24.839 --> 09:26.423
Agent Rossabi!

09:26.507 --> 09:27.841
What have you got?

09:27.892 --> 09:30.043
Divers found this jacket
hanging from a branch.

09:30.094 --> 09:31.595
Old dry cleaner receipt
inside the pocket

09:31.679 --> 09:32.919
has got the victim's name
on it.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.314
The current must have pulled it
off the body.

09:34.382 --> 09:37.217
This was also in the pocket.

09:37.268 --> 09:40.720
Flash drive.
Here's that solid lead.

09:40.772 --> 09:43.723
Take it to the lab.

09:48.696 --> 09:49.780
Gentle!

09:49.864 --> 09:51.832
Don't take it out
on the hardware!

09:51.899 --> 09:54.067
You should have seen the
cleanup at Seth's brownstone.

09:54.118 --> 09:56.954
Even the safe was emptied out.
It obviously wasn't us.

09:57.038 --> 09:58.238
Joan dusted.

09:58.289 --> 09:59.739
Henry must have sent in a team
to sterilize.

09:59.791 --> 10:02.209
Yeah, but a crime scene
that clean sets off alarm bells.

10:02.260 --> 10:03.343
Now Rossabi thinks there's

10:03.411 --> 10:05.462
a conspiracy to cover up
Seth's murder.

10:05.546 --> 10:06.880
Well, there kind of is.

10:06.931 --> 10:08.248
Why would Henry want to kick

10:08.299 --> 10:10.968
the FBI investigation
into high gear?

10:11.052 --> 10:12.970
So someone gets caught.

10:13.054 --> 10:14.104
But it's not gonna be us.

10:14.188 --> 10:16.106
Here, this one.

10:18.393 --> 10:20.310
Great.

10:23.815 --> 10:26.266
I'm gonna upload
some custom files.

10:26.317 --> 10:29.369
Should keep the FBI techs
chasing their tails.

10:29.437 --> 10:30.770
How long is it gonna take?

10:30.822 --> 10:33.540
'Cause I need to go back
to Hoover to make the switch.

10:33.607 --> 10:35.876
Oh, easy there.
There's no rushing this.

10:35.943 --> 10:40.297
The flash drive has to show
signs of water damage.

10:41.799 --> 10:44.718
Fresh from the Potomac.

10:46.421 --> 10:48.889
All right.

10:48.956 --> 10:51.508
And now, we soak.

10:57.131 --> 11:00.567
What's going on?

11:00.634 --> 11:02.569
Rossabi fast-tracked
the DNA results.

11:02.636 --> 11:04.571
We have 48 hours.

11:08.609 --> 11:10.744
Okay.

11:10.811 --> 11:12.946
I'm gonna try and hack
into the FBI servers

11:12.997 --> 11:15.482
and alter the DNA results
electronically.

11:15.533 --> 11:18.618
- That seems like a long shot.
- I won't miss.

11:18.670 --> 11:21.154
- That also sounds illegal.
- Only if I get caught.

11:21.205 --> 11:24.541
Yeah, you mean unlike me?

11:24.625 --> 11:28.161
We'll get through this.

11:28.212 --> 11:29.463
I just...

11:29.514 --> 11:32.966
Wish it wasn't gonna take
all night.

11:34.719 --> 11:38.138
Watching it isn't gonna
make time go any faster.

12:01.129 --> 12:03.213
Watch your step,
Miss Walker.

12:05.633 --> 12:09.002
Prime location!
Penthouse suite.

12:09.053 --> 12:12.005
Perfect view of the Potomac!
Ladybug Red?

12:12.056 --> 12:16.927
Studies show the color boosts
the performance of workers

12:17.011 --> 12:18.595
with detail-oriented tasks.

12:18.679 --> 12:20.263
It's also
the color of blood.

12:20.348 --> 12:22.599
Is it?

12:24.685 --> 12:29.856
Lexington Global Consulting
and Risk Management.

12:29.907 --> 12:32.325
Has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

12:32.393 --> 12:34.727
You a revolutionary war buff?

12:34.779 --> 12:36.729
Is it the, uh,
"shot heard round the world"?

12:36.781 --> 12:39.950
No, the racehorse.

12:40.034 --> 12:43.286
Sired some of the greatest
champions in history.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.873
My hope is, my new endeavor
can spawn

12:46.924 --> 12:50.076
the next generation
of superior spies,

12:50.128 --> 12:52.763
yourself included.

12:52.847 --> 12:55.549
We'll be up and running
by the first of the month.

12:55.600 --> 12:59.102
That's in four days.

12:59.187 --> 13:02.272
Enough money,
and the right motivation,

13:02.356 --> 13:05.275
anything can be accomplished.

13:05.359 --> 13:09.112
Ask my new clients
at Solstar.

13:09.197 --> 13:13.600
Pesos and fear motivated them
to sign on the dotted line.

13:13.651 --> 13:15.768
I'm building an elite team
here in D.C.

13:15.820 --> 13:19.439
You have proven yourself elite.

13:19.490 --> 13:22.876
You interested
in a full-time position?

13:22.943 --> 13:24.744
I've already got a job.

13:24.796 --> 13:27.447
Well, like I said,

13:27.498 --> 13:30.467
"enough money
and the right motivation."

13:30.551 --> 13:31.968
What's that?

13:32.053 --> 13:33.336
It's the amount of money

13:33.421 --> 13:35.505
you are currently owed
by Lexington.

13:35.590 --> 13:37.224
How does Lexington
owe me anything?

13:37.291 --> 13:42.179
For work you've already done,
in Colombia and here.

13:42.263 --> 13:45.798
In the private sector,
no bad deed goes unrewarded.

13:50.804 --> 13:54.307
Shame about Seth Newman.

13:54.358 --> 13:55.442
Were you two close?

13:55.493 --> 13:58.445
Seth was a business associate
of mine,

13:58.496 --> 14:01.615
part-time and off the books,
just like you.

14:04.335 --> 14:08.121
I recently heard the FBI is
in possession of a flash drive

14:08.172 --> 14:10.707
found on Seth's body.

14:10.791 --> 14:11.842
I want it.

14:11.926 --> 14:14.160
I want you to get it for me.

14:14.212 --> 14:16.996
- You want me to get it for you?
- In exchange for your services,

14:17.048 --> 14:19.933
I can provide assistance
with your investigation.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.435
- What investigation?
- Seth Newman's murder.

14:22.503 --> 14:25.639
You are the liaison
with the FBI, correct?

14:25.690 --> 14:29.192
The CIA and the FBI
are handling it.

14:29.277 --> 14:31.695
But their interests
don't align with ours

14:31.779 --> 14:34.114
on this one, do they?

14:34.181 --> 14:36.483
What are your interests,
exactly?

14:36.534 --> 14:39.536
Get me the flash drive,
and I'll tell you.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.821
Let me know
if I can offer my support.

14:41.873 --> 14:43.957
I take care of my own.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.731
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.810
I have to register
some evidence.

15:01.811 --> 15:05.331
I'll take it.

15:05.415 --> 15:09.418
Sorry, but I have to watch you
enter it into inventory myself.

15:09.486 --> 15:12.488
You have your protocols,
and we have ours.

15:12.539 --> 15:14.490
All right.
Come on.

15:41.151 --> 15:42.485
Excuse me.
Sure.

15:42.536 --> 15:44.820
Hello?
Hello?

15:48.291 --> 15:51.527
What are you doing here?

15:51.578 --> 15:52.745
Good morning to you too.

15:52.829 --> 15:54.589
No, let me rephrase.
What are you doing here?

15:54.631 --> 15:58.167
My job.
A colleague of mine is dead.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.969
Are you really questioning
my dedication?

16:00.036 --> 16:01.720
No, only your intentions.

16:01.805 --> 16:03.806
Uh
you know what?

16:03.873 --> 16:06.809
I do have another reason
for being here.

16:09.980 --> 16:13.015
This flash drive was found
in the pocket of a CIA lawyer,

16:13.066 --> 16:14.550
and that makes it
Agency property.

16:14.601 --> 16:15.841
I knew you were
up to something.

16:15.885 --> 16:16.986
Be mad if you want.

16:17.053 --> 16:18.487
This is going straight
to Langley.

16:18.555 --> 16:21.890
Only if I'm delivering it
to Calder Michaels directly.

16:23.410 --> 16:26.395
He reached out to me.

16:26.446 --> 16:28.564
He's expecting us.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.681
The FBI's hard work
won't go overlooked.

16:34.704 --> 16:36.572
You'll have my full support
going forward.

16:36.623 --> 16:37.923
Well, that is refreshing,

16:38.008 --> 16:40.242
seeing that "cooperation"
has never been a word

16:40.293 --> 16:42.545
in Walker's vocabulary.

16:45.560 --> 16:46.760
I'm trying to establish
a fresh way

16:46.811 --> 16:48.262
of doing things around here.

16:48.313 --> 16:52.132
Well, whatever files the water
didn't damage are encrypted.

16:52.184 --> 16:53.901
My techs came up empty.

16:53.968 --> 16:55.436
Maybe your people
will have better luck.

16:55.487 --> 16:57.988
You could have
said that earlier.

16:58.073 --> 16:59.356
Agent Rossabi.

16:59.441 --> 17:00.741
I heard you were
on the premises.

17:00.808 --> 17:02.776
I wanted to return your call
in person.

17:02.827 --> 17:04.310
Calls, as in multiple.

17:04.362 --> 17:07.498
I left your assistant
a dozen messages.

17:07.582 --> 17:11.452
I wouldn't be here if
Mr. Michaels hadn't reached out.

17:11.502 --> 17:13.253
Releasing declassified files

17:13.320 --> 17:15.122
has to run
through all the proper channels.

17:15.173 --> 17:16.207
It takes time.

17:16.290 --> 17:17.875
I was actually calling
with specifics

17:17.959 --> 17:21.127
regarding your personal
relationship with the victim.

17:21.179 --> 17:22.930
Do you mind
sharing a few minutes?

17:22.997 --> 17:24.998
In the name
of interagency cooperation.

17:25.050 --> 17:26.800
Course not.

17:26.851 --> 17:30.437
Annie, Calder, I'll circle back
with you in a moment.

17:30.505 --> 17:32.940
Well, they are a part
of this investigation.

17:33.007 --> 17:35.359
They should be
a part of this...

17:35.443 --> 17:38.362
Unless you feel
that they shouldn't.

17:38.446 --> 17:39.697
Fine with me.

17:39.781 --> 17:41.699
Great.

17:44.953 --> 17:47.571
You knew Seth Newman?

17:47.656 --> 17:48.989
Yes, very well.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.525
We had an intimate relationship
years ago.

17:51.576 --> 17:54.361
Close and continuing paperwork
was filed.

17:54.412 --> 17:59.917
The FBI accessed the GPS
computer in Seth Newman's car.

18:00.001 --> 18:01.885
That's every place he drove
in the past six months.

18:01.970 --> 18:03.504
He was at your home
three weeks ago.

18:03.555 --> 18:05.872
Well, we had dinner plans,
as friends,

18:05.924 --> 18:08.175
but I wasn't feeling well,
so I cancelled

18:08.226 --> 18:10.761
and sent Seth on his way.

18:10.845 --> 18:15.599
Mmhmm.

18:15.684 --> 18:18.986
You and Mr. Newman were
in Narcotics Anonymous together.

18:21.856 --> 18:23.724
Was there anything discussed
during group meetings

18:23.775 --> 18:27.494
that pertains
to this investigation?

18:27.562 --> 18:28.829
No.

18:28.896 --> 18:30.698
Seth was in recovery,

18:30.749 --> 18:34.201
and doing very well,
I might add.

18:34.252 --> 18:36.903
Once an addict,
always an addict.

18:36.955 --> 18:38.905
So you know what it's like.

18:38.957 --> 18:41.875
Seth Newman was in N.A.

18:41.926 --> 18:44.295
That's information
that you should have revealed

18:44.379 --> 18:45.412
from the get-go.

18:45.463 --> 18:48.749
The "A" is for "Anonymous."

18:51.303 --> 18:54.087
You have all the answers
you need, Agent Rossabi?

18:56.524 --> 18:58.892
For now.

19:12.407 --> 19:16.109
Calder is assembling techs
to decrypt Seth's flash drive.

19:16.161 --> 19:18.045
We practically hand-delivered
that intel to Henry.

19:18.112 --> 19:22.082
Mm, not exactly.

19:22.133 --> 19:24.001
Is that the drive?

19:24.085 --> 19:25.452
How?

19:25.503 --> 19:27.304
Magic kit when I was nine.

19:28.623 --> 19:31.558
As if I needed another reason
to be into you.

19:31.626 --> 19:33.627
Device is top of the line.

19:33.678 --> 19:36.129
AES cipher locks,
2048 bit R.S.A.

19:36.181 --> 19:38.098
Brute force decryption
is the only way.

19:38.149 --> 19:39.132
Okay, uh, pretend
you're talking

19:39.184 --> 19:40.234
to your girlfriend
and not barber.

19:41.936 --> 19:44.521
We break down the flash drive
one file at a time,

19:44.606 --> 19:47.775
systematically trying every
possible password combination.

19:47.826 --> 19:49.493
It's effective, but slow.

19:49.577 --> 19:51.995
Very slow.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.998
So far, all I've been able
to access is this.

19:56.751 --> 19:58.619
- What is that?
- You tell me.

19:58.670 --> 20:01.338
It looks like
a photo of a jungle somewhere?

20:01.423 --> 20:03.090
All right, well,
I plugged the pixel data

20:03.157 --> 20:04.708
into every program
that I have.

20:04.793 --> 20:07.461
There's no data scale.
There's no electronic key.

20:07.512 --> 20:08.879
It's like a puzzle piece
with no box top,

20:08.963 --> 20:10.848
or any other pieces.
Great, the DNA results

20:10.932 --> 20:12.299
come in, and I'm going down.

20:12.350 --> 20:14.802
I need something tangible
to take Henry along with me.

20:14.853 --> 20:17.438
You're not going down.
We just need to keep digging.

20:17.505 --> 20:18.505
It takes time.

20:18.556 --> 20:20.691
One thing we don't have
is time.

20:22.610 --> 20:27.147
There is no need to remind me
of the clock on this mission.

20:27.198 --> 20:29.149
Sorry.

20:30.852 --> 20:32.185
Maybe I should cash in
Henry's check

20:32.237 --> 20:33.404
and get us some more
computer firepower.

20:33.488 --> 20:35.539
As much as I'd love
a Cray Titan right now,

20:35.623 --> 20:37.241
it's not worth taking
Henry's money.

20:37.325 --> 20:39.159
You got to admit,
it wouldn't be

20:39.210 --> 20:40.527
the dumbest spy play
to work for him.

20:40.578 --> 20:41.912
No, but it would be
the riskiest.

20:41.996 --> 20:45.833
We just need something
to link Henry to Seth.

20:45.884 --> 20:47.634
A photo of trees
is not gonna do it.

20:47.702 --> 20:49.420
No, but it might tell us
what Henry's next move is.

20:49.504 --> 20:53.424
We don't even have a clue
what his last move was.

20:53.508 --> 20:56.560
Wait.

20:56.644 --> 21:00.714
Agent Rossabi used the GPS
computer on Seth Newman's car

21:00.765 --> 21:04.384
to trace his driving history,
and we have that data.

21:04.436 --> 21:07.354
So if we could do the same thing
with Henry's car,

21:07.405 --> 21:09.285
if we establish that they were
at the same place

21:09.357 --> 21:13.160
at the same time, we could show
a pattern of meets.

21:13.227 --> 21:14.728
Okay, your solution
has a problem--

21:14.779 --> 21:17.731
how do we keep Henry occupied?

21:23.404 --> 21:24.905
- Yeah?
- Sorry to call so late.

21:24.956 --> 21:26.457
I, uh, hope
you weren't sleeping.

21:26.541 --> 21:28.625
- Wide awake, Walker.
- Check your inbox.

21:28.710 --> 21:31.295
I just sent you the Seth Newman
phone records you requested.

21:31.379 --> 21:32.846
In exchange for what?

21:32.914 --> 21:34.080
Your help.

21:34.132 --> 21:37.083
There was a name there
that raised a red flag.

21:37.135 --> 21:39.720
It's just a hunch, but I thought
it was worth tracking down.

21:39.771 --> 21:41.054
Okay, what's the name?

21:41.105 --> 21:44.475
Henry Wilcox.

21:55.629 --> 21:57.946
Jai is so young
in this picture.

21:57.998 --> 22:00.449
He and his mother
loved camping.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.051
Not me.

22:02.118 --> 22:03.785
Bugs.

22:03.837 --> 22:05.421
Dirt.

22:05.472 --> 22:09.391
But the smile on his face
when we got out to Hillcrest...

22:16.016 --> 22:18.300
Some of my fondest memories
together.

22:24.074 --> 22:26.942
Have you brought my flash drive?

22:26.993 --> 22:28.994
The FBI turned it over
to Langley.

22:29.079 --> 22:32.364
Tech Ops is decrypting it now.

22:32.449 --> 22:33.916
Unfortunate.

22:33.983 --> 22:37.836
The Agency loves
glacial projects.

22:37.921 --> 22:40.422
I do not.

22:40.490 --> 22:42.207
Don't you have a mole
in the building

22:42.292 --> 22:44.627
that can get it for you?

22:44.678 --> 22:49.515
Not as talented as you,
Miss Walker.

22:49.599 --> 22:51.967
So...why are you here?

22:55.271 --> 22:59.141
The FBI has obtained all
of Seth Newman's phone records.

22:59.192 --> 23:02.144
Eventually, you're gonna
be called in for questioning.

23:02.195 --> 23:04.146
I look forward to it.

23:06.366 --> 23:09.234
Agent Rossabi is not
to be taken lightly.

23:09.319 --> 23:10.452
Neither am I.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.072
Consider yourself warned.

23:13.156 --> 23:16.375
You're here
out of self-interest.

23:16.459 --> 23:20.329
Scared I'll turn you over
to the FBI.

23:20.380 --> 23:22.030
Don't worry.

23:22.082 --> 23:25.834
Your secret is safe with me.

23:39.399 --> 23:42.601
Target's arrived.

23:46.222 --> 23:48.824
Our clock has officially
started ticking.

23:48.891 --> 23:51.193
Go, go.
Annie, they're on their way.

24:25.361 --> 24:26.601
How can I assist you
in catching

24:26.613 --> 24:28.814
the person responsible for this?

24:28.898 --> 24:30.032
Mr. Wilcox.

24:30.099 --> 24:32.401
Annie Walker.
Nice to see you again.

24:32.452 --> 24:34.486
Have we met before?

24:34.571 --> 24:36.705
We were introduced at
the Goldbergs' Christmas party.

24:36.773 --> 24:37.906
Of course.

24:37.957 --> 24:39.074
I'm out of the spy game
so long,

24:39.125 --> 24:41.460
my skills are rusty.

24:41.544 --> 24:43.712
Ah, my day is jam-packed.

24:43.780 --> 24:45.964
Um, let's try
to speed this along.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.050
Right this way.

24:57.727 --> 25:00.295
Okay, wait here.
I'm just gonna lay it down.

25:08.404 --> 25:14.026
These are Seth Newman's phone
records from the last month.

25:14.110 --> 25:16.411
You spoke often.
Close friends?

25:16.479 --> 25:17.996
Friends, sure.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.981
It was mostly
a professional relationship.

25:20.033 --> 25:22.317
55 calls
over a two-week span.

25:22.368 --> 25:24.002
What did you two discuss?

25:24.087 --> 25:25.654
Seth was a lawyer.

25:25.705 --> 25:27.923
He provided legal counsel
from time to time.

25:27.990 --> 25:29.258
55 calls?

25:29.325 --> 25:31.326
Well, it makes sense,
that you'd have

25:31.377 --> 25:33.462
a lawyer on speed dial.

25:33.513 --> 25:34.993
It's not every day
that you meet a man

25:34.997 --> 25:37.633
who's been in prison
for treason.

25:37.684 --> 25:40.803
Then released.

25:40.854 --> 25:41.837
Commutation of sentence

25:41.888 --> 25:44.640
has nothing to do
with innocence.

25:48.845 --> 25:51.179
Need to know every place
this car has been.

25:51.231 --> 25:52.312
How far back
you need to go?

25:52.348 --> 25:56.068
Since it drove off the lot.

25:59.689 --> 26:01.039
Exactly what am I guilty of?

26:01.124 --> 26:04.042
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

26:05.245 --> 26:09.715
See, the last call
that Seth ever made...

26:12.585 --> 26:15.871
was to you.

26:15.922 --> 26:20.058
I don't think he expected it
to be his last call, do you?

26:26.215 --> 26:28.150
Are we about done here?

26:28.217 --> 26:29.768
Uh, Agent Rossabi, could I--
could I talk to you

26:29.853 --> 26:32.053
in the hallway for a moment,
please?

26:33.273 --> 26:36.608
We'll just be a moment,
Mr. Wilcox.

26:36.693 --> 26:38.994
Yes?

26:39.061 --> 26:41.496
He's hiding something.

26:41.564 --> 26:43.832
Maybe, but we don't have
anything else to go on.

26:43.900 --> 26:46.251
Well, drill down harder
on the phone records.

26:46.336 --> 26:49.338
He already admitted
to calling Newman.

26:49.405 --> 26:53.041
Were you even paying attention
in there?

26:58.247 --> 27:00.432
Come on.

27:00.516 --> 27:02.250
Thank you, Mr. Wilcox.

27:02.302 --> 27:04.586
We'll be in touch
if any further questions arise.

27:20.453 --> 27:23.739
Excuse me, sir,
could I get your pass?

27:50.817 --> 27:53.185
That was some bullshit.
You were stalling back there.

27:53.269 --> 27:55.237
- You're paranoid.
- Agent Rossabi!

27:55.304 --> 27:57.155
- Not now.
- Sir!

27:57.240 --> 27:59.074
16th and Park.

27:59.141 --> 28:00.659
Someone used one
of Seth Newman's credit cards

28:00.743 --> 28:03.245
to pay for a pizza.

28:09.419 --> 28:12.654
2708 Park Road,
apartment eight,

28:12.705 --> 28:16.124
rented by one Marlon Higgins.

28:16.175 --> 28:20.262
Served three years for
possession and drug trafficking.

28:20.329 --> 28:22.664
What are you thinking?

28:22.715 --> 28:25.500
I'm thinking
it doesn't make sense.

28:25.551 --> 28:27.168
Well, we never found
Seth's wallet.

28:27.220 --> 28:30.171
Took three weeks
to use the card?

28:40.233 --> 28:42.150
Marlon Higgins?

28:44.821 --> 28:46.621
FBI, stop!

29:35.254 --> 29:37.205
Oh!

30:08.153 --> 30:09.356
Don't stand there all quiet,
Walker.

30:09.357 --> 30:11.225
You know this doesn't add up.

30:11.779 --> 30:13.780
They found Seth's wallet
and his credit cards.

30:13.831 --> 30:15.866
He was in Narcotics Anonymous.
Marlon was a dealer.

30:15.950 --> 30:17.751
It adds up for a reason.

30:17.818 --> 30:19.369
You expect me to believe that
that junkie was capable

30:19.453 --> 30:21.588
of the cleanup
at Newman's brownstone?

30:21.655 --> 30:24.490
I am not falling
for this cloak-and-dagger shit.

30:24.542 --> 30:27.177
I'm fine!

30:27.261 --> 30:28.461
You know what I think?

30:28.513 --> 30:30.430
I think there was a fight
at the brownstone,

30:30.497 --> 30:32.516
it got messy, and the brawl
spilled out onto the bridge,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.167
and Seth Newman was killed.

30:34.218 --> 30:36.669
You spooks
are covering it up.

30:36.721 --> 30:38.054
I realize you just fell
out of a building,

30:38.139 --> 30:39.606
so I'm going to ignore
the wild accusations.

30:39.673 --> 30:41.525
Save your breath,

30:41.609 --> 30:43.193
because nothing you say to me
is gonna stop me

30:43.277 --> 30:45.529
from getting
to the bottom of this.

30:48.115 --> 30:51.818
Let's wait for the DNA results
before we chalk it up to a win.

31:03.130 --> 31:04.998
Auggie!

31:05.049 --> 31:07.250
Are you all right?

31:09.053 --> 31:12.872
It's not the first time I had
a gun pointed at my head.

31:13.925 --> 31:16.059
I couldn't do it.

31:18.229 --> 31:19.229
What?

31:19.313 --> 31:21.181
The FBI firewalls
are too secure.

31:21.232 --> 31:23.400
Every time I got access
to the DNA results,

31:23.484 --> 31:25.518
it would automatically
kick me out.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.823
I'm sorry.

31:29.890 --> 31:33.026
Maybe I can talk to Rossabi

31:33.077 --> 31:35.157
before the lab results come in,
and he'll show mercy.

31:35.196 --> 31:38.865
No.
There's got to be something.

31:38.916 --> 31:40.617
The GPS data
from Henry's car.

31:40.701 --> 31:43.453
You said that the locations
don't correspond

31:43.537 --> 31:44.737
with Seth Newman's
driving record.

31:44.789 --> 31:46.873
Yes, but I found an anomaly.

31:46.924 --> 31:51.911
Henry took a dozen trips out to
a patch of parkland in Virginia.

31:51.963 --> 31:54.414
What was he doing out there?

31:55.633 --> 31:56.967
Sounds like a hail Mary.

31:57.051 --> 31:58.251
It is.

31:58.302 --> 32:00.387
Let's take a ride.

32:07.144 --> 32:10.981
It's less than a mile from here.

32:11.065 --> 32:15.318
Rossabi?

32:15.403 --> 32:17.821
Yeah.

32:17.905 --> 32:19.039
You've reached Annie Walker.

32:19.106 --> 32:20.373
Please leave a message
after the tone.

32:24.462 --> 32:25.945
Took it upon myself to go over

32:25.997 --> 32:27.964
Henry Wilcox's
phone records again.

32:28.049 --> 32:32.752
Guess whose number showed up.
Yours.

33:03.534 --> 33:05.502
Federal Agent Rossabi.

33:05.586 --> 33:09.089
To what do I owe
the pleasure?

33:09.156 --> 33:12.492
I know that you've been
colluding with Annie Walker.

33:12.543 --> 33:14.794
Just you?
No backup?

33:14.845 --> 33:18.598
You don't deny it?

33:18.665 --> 33:21.801
When I'm done, you're gonna
be back in a prison cell.

33:26.724 --> 33:30.443
I hear you're a man of honor,
Vince.

33:30.511 --> 33:31.844
May I call you Vince?

33:31.896 --> 33:34.314
No, you may not.

33:34.365 --> 33:38.851
Have a seat, Vince.
We have a lot to talk about.

33:50.864 --> 33:54.050
Perhaps I didn't
make myself clear.

33:54.135 --> 33:56.169
All decisions involving
the investigation

33:56.220 --> 33:59.055
into Seth's murder
are D.C.S. purview.

33:59.140 --> 34:03.059
Going over my head with
Agent Rossabi, assembling techs

34:03.144 --> 34:05.895
to decrypt Seth's flash drive--

34:05.980 --> 34:09.215
a blatant disregard
of direct orders.

34:12.603 --> 34:14.521
Has the team found anything
on the flash drive?

34:14.572 --> 34:18.074
The drive was
too badly damaged, useless.

34:18.159 --> 34:21.194
Then we're done here.

34:21.245 --> 34:23.496
There's a chain of command.

34:23.563 --> 34:24.614
I get that.

34:24.697 --> 34:28.368
Protocols in place
to maintain order.

34:28.418 --> 34:31.737
But we are both patriots,

34:31.789 --> 34:35.175
out to do what's right
at all costs.

34:35.242 --> 34:38.077
Airing out a co-worker's
dirty laundry

34:38.129 --> 34:40.429
is anything but patriotic.

34:42.132 --> 34:43.466
There was only one way

34:43.551 --> 34:45.585
Agent Rossabi knew about me
being in N.A.,

34:45.636 --> 34:48.438
and that is you.

34:48.522 --> 34:51.107
Dig too deep in this building,
Mr. Michaels,

34:51.192 --> 34:54.060
and you're only gonna
bury yourself.

34:55.529 --> 34:59.482
Now get out of my office.

34:59.567 --> 35:03.987
You said Annie had a great
relationship with the FBI,

35:04.071 --> 35:06.623
and that's why you put her
on this case,

35:06.707 --> 35:10.076
but that fed Rossabi says
she was a pain in his ass.

35:10.127 --> 35:13.163
Interesting management decision.

35:13.247 --> 35:15.948
You're choosing sides, Joan.

35:19.837 --> 35:22.788
I hope you choose wisely.

35:42.576 --> 35:45.978
Describe it to me.

35:46.030 --> 35:48.331
It's a--

35:48.415 --> 35:50.149
It's a wooded meadow
in the middle of nowhere.

35:50.201 --> 35:55.088
There's...tall grass, a--

35:55.155 --> 35:56.456
a river.

35:56.507 --> 35:58.374
It's beautiful, but--

35:58.459 --> 36:01.377
I never took Henry
as a nature buff.

36:02.996 --> 36:06.099
He parked his car here
once a week?

36:06.166 --> 36:09.435
Any sign
of security cameras?

36:09.503 --> 36:12.171
No.

36:12.223 --> 36:14.807
He could have used it for
dead drops or secret meetings,

36:14.859 --> 36:16.893
I don't know.

36:23.984 --> 36:25.568
Or paying his respects.

36:25.653 --> 36:27.353
What?

36:27.404 --> 36:30.206
This is where Henry took Jai
camping as a boy.

36:33.244 --> 36:35.695
He's still grieving.

36:35.746 --> 36:37.830
You're not feeling sorry
for him, are you?

36:39.866 --> 36:43.169
Greed can be bought,
and anger cools,

36:43.220 --> 36:45.171
but grief?

36:47.925 --> 36:49.475
He's never gonna give this up.

36:51.729 --> 36:54.731
Rossabi?

36:54.815 --> 36:56.482
Five times
in the last 20 minutes?

36:56.550 --> 36:59.519
The DNA results must be back.

36:59.570 --> 37:01.521
He knows.

37:22.432 --> 37:23.596
We need to talk.

37:25.230 --> 37:28.315
There's nothing to discuss.

37:30.301 --> 37:33.970
The skin underneath
Seth Newman's fingernails

37:34.022 --> 37:36.240
was a match
for Marlon Higgins.

37:37.975 --> 37:39.693
Marlon Higgins?

37:39.778 --> 37:41.612
Seth was an addict,

37:41.663 --> 37:45.616
Marlon was a dealer,
it all adds up.

37:49.454 --> 37:51.789
Just like you said.

37:54.426 --> 37:57.828
You have friends in low places,
Miss Walker.

38:21.953 --> 38:23.854
Am I supposed to thank you?

38:23.905 --> 38:25.689
Hello, Miss Walker.

38:25.740 --> 38:27.791
Do you like
the finished space?

38:27.859 --> 38:30.494
Like I said, with the right
amount of money and motivation--

38:30.545 --> 38:32.362
I don't need you
to save me!

38:32.414 --> 38:35.249
Oh, I think you do.

38:35.333 --> 38:36.884
They had you dead to rights.

38:36.968 --> 38:40.054
Inserting Higgins
as the patsy was easy.

38:40.138 --> 38:41.755
Getting Rossabi

38:41.840 --> 38:44.892
to alter the DNA evidence
required some work.

38:44.976 --> 38:47.043
To be honest,
I expected your boy

38:47.095 --> 38:49.396
Auggie Anderson
to come through.

38:49.481 --> 38:53.233
Must be hard for him to accept
that I had to step in--

38:53.318 --> 38:56.236
You leave Auggie out of it.

38:58.189 --> 39:00.441
Did I strike a nerve?

39:02.277 --> 39:03.410
My apologies.

39:03.495 --> 39:07.498
How did you turn Rossabi?

39:07.565 --> 39:09.900
Once an addict,
always an addict.

39:09.951 --> 39:11.902
Booze. Mistakes.

39:11.953 --> 39:15.456
Regret. Opportunity.

39:18.510 --> 39:21.128
Any person can be influenced,

39:21.212 --> 39:24.882
turned completely
by the contents of...

39:24.933 --> 39:27.267
One single piece of paper.

39:27.352 --> 39:31.054
The only trick is finding
the right piece of paper.

39:31.106 --> 39:33.223
Rossabi is a good man.

39:33.274 --> 39:35.442
Who was going to ruin
your future.

39:35.527 --> 39:38.278
Is that what this is about?

39:38.363 --> 39:41.097
Getting me into trouble,
so only you can save me?

39:41.149 --> 39:43.867
You needed to see
what I'm capable of.

39:45.987 --> 39:48.438
What are you doing?

39:48.490 --> 39:51.375
Why are you dragging me
down with you, Henry?

39:51.442 --> 39:54.444
This is your last chance.

39:54.496 --> 39:58.415
There will not be
another offer.

39:58.466 --> 40:02.252
Are you ready to commit
to a full-time position?

40:03.721 --> 40:06.390
To commit to me?

40:22.574 --> 40:24.825
- I could never work for you.
- Big mistake!

40:24.909 --> 40:27.778
Whatever you're playing at,
it's not gonna bring Jai back.

40:27.829 --> 40:30.480
You need to make peace
with that.

40:30.532 --> 40:34.001
Don't presume you can
possibly grasp what I need.

40:34.085 --> 40:36.787
You haven't lost
nearly enough yet.

40:36.838 --> 40:38.455
I held out my hand

40:38.506 --> 40:39.957
and pulled you
out of the fire,

40:40.008 --> 40:41.091
and this is how you repay me!

40:41.158 --> 40:43.210
You're gonna get
what you deserve.

40:43.294 --> 40:46.930
I have Seth Newman's
flash drive,

40:46.998 --> 40:49.883
and I am taking you down.

40:49.968 --> 40:52.269
Lies.

40:52.336 --> 40:53.804
Photos.

40:55.890 --> 40:57.140
You walk out of here,

40:57.192 --> 40:59.610
filled
with righteous indignation,

40:59.677 --> 41:01.812
convinced that you are
on the side of good!

41:01.863 --> 41:03.030
But I want you to think

41:03.114 --> 41:05.365
about those
you've aligned yourself with

41:05.450 --> 41:08.485
and to learn more!
Get to the point!

41:08.536 --> 41:10.537
The last few days,
I've learned quite a bit

41:10.622 --> 41:13.740
about Auggie's ex
Helen Hansen.

41:13.825 --> 41:15.659
Has he told you about her?

41:15.710 --> 41:19.195
Yeah, he did.
He told me everything.

41:19.247 --> 41:21.197
Everything?

41:23.134 --> 41:26.587
Ask him if he's talked
to her recently.

41:26.671 --> 41:28.371
What do you mean?
She's dead!

41:28.423 --> 41:31.558
Is she?

41:31.643 --> 41:33.977
Ask him.

41:36.213 --> 41:39.049
You've chosen the wrong side,
Miss Walker.

41:42.053 --> 41:45.489
Now you're going
to burn with them!
