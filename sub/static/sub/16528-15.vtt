ADULT ADAM:<i> Ah, the child</i>
<i> stars of the '80's.</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:04.236
<i> They were</i>
<i> the coolest kids around,</i>

00:04.238 --> 00:05.838
<i> and we all wanted to be them.</i>

00:05.840 --> 00:06.572
<i> As fate would have it,</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:09.274
<i> one grew up with me</i>
<i> in Jenkintown.</i>

00:09.276 --> 00:10.209
<i> It was R.D. Robb,</i>

00:10.211 --> 00:12.311
<i> and I kind of knew him,</i>
<i> sort of.</i>

00:12.313 --> 00:14.313
<i> Well, go on, smartass,</i>
<i> and do it.</i>

00:14.315 --> 00:16.682
Guys, look, it's R.D. Robb
from school.

00:16.684 --> 00:19.284
I can't believe my best friend
is famous and on TV.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.854
Dude, you said two words
to R.D. on the school bus.

00:21.856 --> 00:24.189
Now that he's famous,
he's suddenly your best pal?

00:24.191 --> 00:26.225
We traded Matchbox cars
in third grade.

00:26.227 --> 00:27.126
That's not nothing.

00:27.128 --> 00:29.194
You know,
now that R.D. is on TV,

00:29.196 --> 00:31.730
I am realizing
that he is totally hot.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.531
Yeah,
dude is so lucky.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.067
Did you know his mom is
the top talent manager
in the city?

00:35.069 --> 00:37.169
Oh, yeah, Edie Robb's
got a sharp eye.

00:37.171 --> 00:40.005
I've seen her scoop a kid up
in the frozen-food aisle

00:40.007 --> 00:42.174
and put him on the cover
of<i> Bop</i> magazine.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.809
<i> Bop</i> is the gateway
to<i> TigerBeat.</i>

00:43.811 --> 00:46.545
Hold up.
You know Edie Robb?

00:46.547 --> 00:47.046
Loosely.

00:47.048 --> 00:48.781
She and my mom swim
in the same yenta circles.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.682
They get their pastrami
from the same deli guy.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.384
What the hell
are you waiting for, bro?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.953
Ask her to be your manager
and make you famous.

00:54.955 --> 00:55.554
Wrong!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.356
If anyone's gonna be famous,
it's gonna be me.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.658
Please, what makes you think
you can be famous?

00:59.660 --> 01:00.726
'Cause I can play
any part.

01:00.728 --> 01:04.630
Badass action star,
romantic lead, comic relief,

01:04.632 --> 01:05.898
plus I do accents.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.433
I'm from Russia. Blue jeans.

01:07.435 --> 01:10.335
The only talent you have
is being delusional.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.570
I'll make you
eat those words

01:11.572 --> 01:14.373
once Haim and Feldman
make me the third Corey.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.708
How can you be a Corey?
Your name's Barry.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.477
Being a Corey
is a way of life.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.311
And when we're on set,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.280
I'm gonna make you
my sad little assistant

01:21.282 --> 01:22.781
and I'll say,
"Go get me a Coke."

01:22.783 --> 01:24.750
Then you'll come back
and give me a Coke

01:24.752 --> 01:26.585
and then I'll yell,
"I said Diet Coke!"

01:26.587 --> 01:28.720
And then you'll cry,
"No, you said Coke!"

01:28.722 --> 01:30.656
And then I'll say,
"Don't you ever question me

01:30.658 --> 01:32.057
"in front of
the other two Coreys."

01:32.059 --> 01:34.026
Well, then I'll throw
the Coke in your face,

01:34.028 --> 01:35.761
and the director
will see my passion

01:35.763 --> 01:38.063
and make me the lead
of<i> Lost Boys 2.</i>

01:38.065 --> 01:39.298
And now I'm a Corey.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.833
There can't be four Coreys!

01:40.835 --> 01:43.001
Well, then we take a vote,
and you're out.

01:43.003 --> 01:43.869
You can't do that!

01:43.871 --> 01:45.938
I own a Camaro
and a beach house.

01:45.940 --> 01:48.574
It takes a ton of money
keeping up with the Coreys,

01:48.576 --> 01:50.642
and now I'm broke,
thanks to you!

01:50.644 --> 01:51.877
(BOTH GRUNTING)

01:51.879 --> 01:53.946
We're just gonna go...

01:53.948 --> 01:55.547
I'm the Corey!

01:56.484 --> 01:57.950
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:57.952 --> 02:01.720
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:04.191 --> 02:05.324
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:05.326 --> 02:09.394
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:10.197 --> 02:12.764
ADULT ADAM:<i> It was</i>
<i> February 22, 1980-something,</i>

02:12.766 --> 02:16.702
<i> and the punk-rock revolution</i>
<i> was taking over our town.</i>

02:16.704 --> 02:18.637
Yikes, what happened
to Matt Bradley?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.073
He looks like Billy Idol's
suburban nephew.

02:21.075 --> 02:23.208
I think the punk look
is crazy-hot.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.943
He's such a bad boy.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.311
Hey, I'm a bad boy.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.412
Chill. I'm just suggesting

02:27.414 --> 02:28.714
that Matt's an attractive,
single dude,

02:28.716 --> 02:30.649
and Erica's
an attractive single girl.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.017
Maybe she's ready
to get back out there.

02:32.019 --> 02:35.020
Erica, heard you were ready
to get back out there.

02:35.022 --> 02:35.888
Go away, Dave Kim.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.790
You'll know
when it's right.
Take your time.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.359
And that's a no
on Matt, too.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.493
Dating bad boys
is your thing.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.729
Obviously.
That's why she locked me down.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.330
Honey,
you're kind and sweet

02:45.332 --> 02:46.331
and that's
why I like you.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.133
But you're the opposite
of punk rock.

02:48.135 --> 02:48.867
Then I'll become

02:48.869 --> 02:51.036
the opposite of
the opposite of punk rock.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.205
So, punk rock.
Please don't, Barry.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.206
You just can't pull it off.

02:54.208 --> 02:56.074
Oh, I'll pull it
all the way off.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.310
I'll become the punkiest
punk-ass punk

02:58.312 --> 03:00.412
this school
has ever seen.

03:00.414 --> 03:01.613
What are you doing?
Nothing.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.982
Remember how Barry
got jealous of Boy George,

03:03.984 --> 03:04.950
so he dressed up
like him?

03:04.952 --> 03:06.718
Well, now Barry's gonna
go all-out to be punk

03:06.720 --> 03:08.820
and oh, my God,
you did this on purpose.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.889
Punk is super sexy.
I want to see Barry

03:10.891 --> 03:12.724
in a studded leather jacket
and tight jeans

03:12.726 --> 03:14.393
and don't gag
like you always do.

03:14.395 --> 03:15.594
I'm sorry, I can't...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.029
(GAGGING) Help it.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.864
(GAGGING)

03:18.866 --> 03:20.866
You two make me ill.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.569
Matt Bradley,
I have huge news.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.803
You're gonna be
my Mentos.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.539
You want me to be
a European mint candy?

03:27.541 --> 03:30.042
No, I want you to teach me
how to talk and dress.

03:30.044 --> 03:30.876
You know, be a punk.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.678
Dude, punk isn't just
some cheap look.

03:32.680 --> 03:36.415
It's a counterculture,
a musical movement,
a life choice.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.482
No one cares about that.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.650
Hold up.
What's in this for me?

03:38.652 --> 03:39.484
Well,
if you do a good job,

03:39.486 --> 03:41.820
I'll make you a member
of the JTP.
Is that a band?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.022
Jenkintown Posse
is more of a small,

03:44.024 --> 03:45.824
weirdly tight-knit
friend group.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.859
Well, it has been hard
to find people

03:47.861 --> 03:49.228
to sit with at lunch.

03:49.230 --> 03:50.395
I think people
are afraid of me.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.731
Aw, 'cause you dress
like a lady ghost?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.566
What? No.
Doesn't matter.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.501
I'm in your hands.
Mentos me.

ADULT ADAM:<i> As Barry</i>
<i> got schooled in punk,</i>

04:43.217 --> 04:44.416
I don't
want to get confused

04:44.418 --> 04:46.318
with the other Adam Goldberg
in my school.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.053
He's got more of
a Jim Jarmusch vibe,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.054
and I'm more of
a Jim Varney.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.056

about that guy,

04:51.058 --> 04:52.124

anyone else.

You are my favorite
Adam Goldberg in the world.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.329

you'll show Edie my reel?

04:58.332 --> 05:01.066
Edie Robb will not only
represent you,

she's gonna make you

05:03.370 --> 05:05.203

05:05.205 --> 05:06.805
of your blind support
of my talents,

05:06.807 --> 05:09.241
but I think you might be
right about this one.

That's how punks
talk to authority, right?

05:38.339 --> 05:40.138
No.
I got a lot to learn.

Yeah,
what was that?

Not Dante.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.156
By your tone,

I'm guessing
you two broke up.

05:59.993 --> 06:00.926
Three years ago!

Do you seriously not know
anything about me?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.996
Peanut,
I'm just bad at names,

don't interest me.

Fine.
Tell me some stuff
about the girl one.

in love with a boy

anymore.

06:37.464 --> 06:38.397
What boy?
Geoff.

The kid
with the giant head?
No.

with the teeny head?
Who are these people?

she's always terrible.

07:23.243 --> 07:23.742
I knew it!

07:23.744 --> 07:26.445
My baby Brando
was made for
the silver screen.

07:26.447 --> 07:28.046
So, you'll sign him?
Absolutely.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.649
I like you, Bev.
You know how to schmooze.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.551
I love to schmooze.
Obviously.

07:32.553 --> 07:33.652
We're schmoozing
right now.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.053
So, what are we picturing
here?

07:35.055 --> 07:38.089
Uh, soap-opera hunk?
Swashbuckling action hero?

07:38.091 --> 07:39.958
Love interest for the hot girl
on<i> My Two Dads?</i>

07:39.960 --> 07:44.095
You know what?
They're holding auditions
for<i> Meatballs II.</i>

07:44.097 --> 07:44.596
Oh, yes.

07:44.598 --> 07:48.567
That's the silly,
summer-camp movie
with Bill Murphy, right?

07:48.569 --> 07:49.634
Yeah, Bill Murray,
but yeah.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.369
All Adam needs
is to get some headshots

07:51.371 --> 07:56.408
and then I could submit him
to play the spazzy schlemiel
in the nerdy bunkhouse.

07:56.410 --> 07:57.542
Whoa,
what's happening here?

07:57.544 --> 08:00.178
Why are you using those words

08:00.180 --> 08:01.646
to describe
my handsome star?

08:01.648 --> 08:05.650
Listen, I get it.
I love my boy R.D.
with all my kishkas,

08:05.652 --> 08:07.819
but when it comes
to booking roles,

08:07.821 --> 08:10.155
he's the number-one shmendrick
in town.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.290
What do you mean?
There's not a dork, dweeb,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.926
yutz, putz, or jamoke
that my brilliant boy
hasn't booked.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.428
But Adam could give him
a run for his money,

08:16.430 --> 08:18.563
which is my money, too,
'cause I take 10%.

08:18.565 --> 08:21.867
Thing is, my baby
is none of those things.

08:21.869 --> 08:25.337
He's more like a handsome hunk
from<i> The Outsiders.</i>

08:25.339 --> 08:27.472
Ah, I see
what's going on here.

08:27.474 --> 08:30.141
You have a completely
unrealistic view of your son.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.845
Please, I have
a very realistic view of Adam,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.580
my little Patrick Swayze.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.414
He's not a Swayze.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.316
Oh, he's a Swayze.
No Swayze.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.751
So Swayze, it's crazy.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.319
You know what?
It really is.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.454
I think we're done here.

08:42.456 --> 08:43.655
No, I'm done with you.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.158
The last thing my Adonis,
angel-face boy needs

08:47.160 --> 08:48.860
is you as his manager.

08:48.862 --> 08:52.197
Guess who's gonna be
represented by Edie Robb?

08:52.199 --> 08:53.231
She said yes?

08:53.233 --> 08:54.099
Like, 1,000 times.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.636
She even said you're the next
Patrick Swayze.
That's no lie.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.537
She said I'm a Swayze?

08:58.539 --> 09:00.472
She said you have
the looks, charisma,

09:00.474 --> 09:01.907
and scrumptiousness.
Seriously?

09:01.909 --> 09:03.108
I'm directly quoting her
on that.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.810
I always thought of myself
as the nudgy comic relief,

09:05.812 --> 09:08.680
like Balki or a Skippy
or a Boner,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.115
but if an objective
third party

09:10.117 --> 09:12.617
is saying
I'm a leading man,
it must be true.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.553
Now all we need
are some hunky headshots

09:14.555 --> 09:15.887
to prove
you're not a total goob.

09:15.889 --> 09:17.822
Not that Edie thinks that.
Nobody does.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.958
Sweet.
I'll go get my Vader cape.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.794
No, wait, not cool enough.
Voltron helmet.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.666
Now that's hunky.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.204
Anarchy, U.K.,
Big Ben, soccer!

09:33.206 --> 09:35.307
Whoa, what's with
the giant hoop?

09:35.309 --> 09:37.008
I stole it
from Mom's jewelry box.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.343
Petty theft
is part of the movement.

09:38.345 --> 09:40.579
Baby, I'm totally digging
what I'm seeing.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.681
But it's not, like,
punk enough yet.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.249
Dude.
I know.
I got problems.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.084
Aw, damn it.
What else do I need to do?

09:46.086 --> 09:47.619
Mmm, your clothes
need to be

09:47.621 --> 09:49.421
all ripped and shredded
and hot.

09:49.423 --> 09:50.355
Right, right.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.490
Look more like an (BLEEP)

09:52.492 --> 09:54.192
Good note.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.160
He's just lashing out.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.696
It's a natural part
of the process.

09:57.864 --> 09:59.864
Erica Goldberg,
this is for you.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.334
Will you be the Kelly McGillis
to my Maverick?

10:02.336 --> 10:03.435
Oh,
he's<i> Top Gun-ing</i> you.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.904
Oh, God, do not<i> Top Gun</i> me
right now.

10:05.906 --> 10:09.040
<i> ¶ You never</i>
<i> close your eyes anymore</i>

10:09.042 --> 10:11.109
<i> ¶ When I kiss your lips ¶</i>

10:11.111 --> 10:12.077
Yep,
And by Air Force law,

10:12.079 --> 10:14.112
now you have to date him.
It's not a law.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.914
<i> ¶ You're trying hard</i>
<i> not to show it</i>

10:15.916 --> 10:18.583
He's being emotionally
vulnerable.
That's hilarious.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.419
<i> ¶ But baby I know it ¶</i>

10:21.421 --> 10:22.554
Everyone.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.022
(ALL BOOING)

10:24.024 --> 10:26.558
Ew!
Erica's dating a freshman.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.093
Erica,
you like that guy?

10:28.095 --> 10:30.028
Nope.
He's very confused.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.730
Not confused.
Her dad specifically told me

10:31.732 --> 10:34.432
she was secretly in
love with me,
but could never admit it.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.734
Okay,
my dad did not do that.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.702
Her dad literally
came into the basement,

10:37.704 --> 10:39.804
looked me in the eye,
and told me that directly.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.440
<i> ¶ You've lost</i>
<i> that lovin' feeling</i>

10:42.442 --> 10:46.077
<i> ¶ Now it's gone,</i>
<i> gone, gone ¶</i>
(ALL BOOING)

10:46.079 --> 10:47.112
And now I'm gone,

10:47.114 --> 10:49.014
because I have
a dad to strangle.

10:49.016 --> 10:49.848
(CROWD BOOING)

10:49.850 --> 10:52.751
I love a good train wreck.
Sing it, dude.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.322
ADULT ADAM:<i> Lainey had</i>
<i> told Barry to up his punk game</i>

10:57.324 --> 10:58.957
<i> and he was</i>
<i> a man on a mission.</i>

10:58.959 --> 11:02.027
Pops, check out this polo
I just shredded.

11:02.029 --> 11:05.430
Lainey said she wanted punk.
I'll give her punk.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.965
Oi! Oi! Oi!

11:06.967 --> 11:07.432
Oy vey.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.301
Where is he?
Where is the man
who helped give me life,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.570
only to ruin it
with his stupidity?

11:12.572 --> 11:14.339
Hey.
There's my peanut.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.040
I am not your peanut.

11:15.042 --> 11:18.109
Because of you,
I got serenaded
in front of the whole school.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.012
You don't have to thank me.
It was the wrong boy.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.948
I like Geoff,
but Dave Kim sang to me.

11:23.950 --> 11:25.784
Oh, no!
Yes.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.018
What have you done,
Murray?

11:27.020 --> 11:30.689
Honestly, I don't know.
This is all so confusing.

11:30.691 --> 11:33.591
This is Dave Kim,
a tiny freshman creeper

11:33.593 --> 11:35.827
who dresses like Velma
from "Scooby Doo."

11:35.829 --> 11:41.099
And this loveable,
sweet dope
is Geoff Schwartz.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.567
So I picked
the wrong boy.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.535
It's the effort
that counts.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.571
I liked it better when
you knew nothing about me.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.272
I can't wait
to go to college

11:47.274 --> 11:51.176
so I can ignore you
for the next four years
and the rest of my life.

11:52.646 --> 11:53.478
You know, I...

11:53.480 --> 11:57.082
I'm not usually known
for feeling things,

11:57.084 --> 11:59.984
but that made me feel...
(WHISPERING) Sad.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.720
What was that?
(WHISPERING) Sad.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.621
(WHISPERING) Sad.
Speak up.

12:03.623 --> 12:04.856
It made me sad, damn it,

12:04.858 --> 12:08.326
like maybe I should
participate in her
life or something.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.227
Maybe?

12:09.229 --> 12:10.695
Of course you should.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.498
Fine! Will you...
(WHISPERING) Teach me?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.167
Say he words out loud,
Murray.

12:16.169 --> 12:16.835
Teach me!

12:16.837 --> 12:19.270
Tell me everything there is
to know about her.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.972
I'll make you
some note cards.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.641
Thanks, Al.
You're a good person.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.343
I know.
Oh. That you heard.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.579
ADULT ADAM:<i> While my dad</i>
<i> learned the basics of Erica,</i>

12:27.581 --> 12:30.882
<i> I was ready to advance</i>
<i> to a world of kid stardom.</i>

12:30.884 --> 12:32.617
You must be
Paul Sirochman.

12:32.619 --> 12:36.454
Rumor has it you're
the headshot king
of Philadelphia.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.555
That's a negative.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.124
We'll see what develops.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.126
Photo jokes...
That's me.

12:41.128 --> 12:41.526
Neat.

12:41.528 --> 12:44.562
Here's the thing.
Um, I need you
to make my son

12:44.564 --> 12:47.298
look like a chiseled,
rugged man-star.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.566
Can you do that?

12:48.568 --> 12:50.301
Wow. Huh.
A challenge.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.037
All right, chin down,
eyes up.

12:53.039 --> 12:54.272
Nice.

12:54.274 --> 12:56.441
And, uh...
Maybe lose that sword.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.375
You wanted rugged,
right?

12:57.377 --> 12:59.944
It doesn't get more rugged
than the<i> Highlander.</i>

12:59.946 --> 13:00.779
There can be only one.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.414
ADULT ADAM:<i> Yep, I was ready</i>
<i> to be a leading man.</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:05.250
It's the communicator
from<i> Quantum Leap.</i>

13:05.252 --> 13:08.319
Hello?
I'm cool like Bakula.
He's the whole package.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.088
ADULT ADAM:
<i> So, I took inspiration</i>

13:10.090 --> 13:11.222
<i> from every leading man</i>
<i> I worshipped.</i>

13:11.224 --> 13:14.092
Should I turn on the finger,
or will that screw up
the lighting?

13:14.094 --> 13:15.460
Just do what you want,
kid.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.328
ADULT ADAM:
<i> And the results were epic.</i>

13:17.330 --> 13:18.663
All right,
I know what you're thinking...

13:18.665 --> 13:21.866
That you're
the best damn photographer
in the universe?

13:21.868 --> 13:23.601
I thought you said
you wanted Swayze?

13:23.603 --> 13:25.203
Oh, Adam's no Swayze.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.705
(SIGHS)
He's Tom Cruise.

13:27.707 --> 13:30.074
My baby is Tom Cruise.

13:31.878 --> 13:36.848
There she is... The girl
I know everything about.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.649
Whoa, what are those?

13:37.651 --> 13:40.685
Pops gave me a master class
all about you.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.520
Now I know everything
there is to know

13:42.522 --> 13:46.257
about
Erica Dorothy Goldberg.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.793
Age 17, who likes
Christian Slater,

13:48.795 --> 13:52.297
Gibson guitars,
and the occasional
side pony,

13:52.299 --> 13:52.864
which is a hairstyle.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.333
Wow, great.
You learned a few things
about me,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.001
and now you're, like,
Dad of the Year.

13:57.003 --> 13:59.337
Ho, ho.
Card number 43...

13:59.339 --> 14:03.341
You cover insecurity
with sarcasm.
Classic Erica.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.909
Stop doing
what you're doing.

14:04.911 --> 14:06.477
I get it. You're mad.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.613
I told Dave Kim
that you loved him,

14:08.615 --> 14:10.949
when it's really
Geoff Schwartz who you love.

14:10.951 --> 14:11.449
Dad, stop!

14:11.451 --> 14:13.685
What, you think
I'm gonna tell Geoff Schwartz

14:13.687 --> 14:16.487
that you... Love him.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.890
That's Geoff Schwartz.

14:18.892 --> 14:22.427
I know that
because of card 27.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.428
I didn't hear
all of that.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.764
I'm... I'm just gonna run away
for an unrelated reason.

14:28.235 --> 14:29.500
Why?

14:30.036 --> 14:33.404
Ugh.
This hair dye itches me
like crazy, dude.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.005
Don't touch
anything else.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.841
Go wash your hands,
quick, before it gets
in your eyes.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.176
Ow! I touched my eyes.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.878
He's touching his eyes.
Why are you doing that?

14:39.880 --> 14:44.048
'Cause you told me not to,
and I'm anti-establishment
now.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.384
Damn my punk lifestyle!
Ugh!

14:46.386 --> 14:49.254
There she is,
just in time
for our 3:00 meeting.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.589
At the deli counter?
Seems kind of weird.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.157
Just zip it
and take the meeting.

14:53.159 --> 14:57.061
Hi, Edie. It's me, Bev,
and my gorgeous
leading-man boy.

14:57.063 --> 15:00.098
Man, boy...
I'll let you decide.
Hello, Adam.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.934
What a coincidence,
running into you here.

15:02.936 --> 15:03.568
Also a coincidence,

15:03.570 --> 15:06.838
I just happen to have
Adam's handsome new headshots.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.640
Doesn't my son look
like a movie star,

15:08.642 --> 15:09.774
Tony the deli guy?
Oh, yeah.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.477
He looks like that twerpy guy,
Rick Moranis.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.479
With those glasses
and that doofy,

15:14.481 --> 15:16.247
deer-caught-in-the-headlights
look.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.750
Okay, that's enough.
Just slice the meat.

15:18.752 --> 15:19.651
No, he's right.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.486
These photos
are fricking incredible.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.187
I mean,
look at that punim.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.622
It's like getting
a lotto ticket

15:24.624 --> 15:26.858
and scratching off
three Urkels and a Potsie.

15:26.860 --> 15:29.160
Potsie's a personal hero
of mine.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.261
You see? I knew it.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.997
He would've been perfect
for<i> Meatballs II.</i>

15:32.999 --> 15:36.668
Which reminds me,
let me have meatballs, too,
and all your tuna.

15:36.670 --> 15:39.938
You understand me?
I don't want that lady
to have any.

15:39.940 --> 15:41.306
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, wait.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.708
"Would've been"?
You mean I missed out on

15:43.710 --> 15:45.610
auditioning for
a<i> Meatballs</i> sequel?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.144
Okay, let me be clear.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.213
You are
a Cruise or a Swayze,
not a geek or a goober.

15:49.215 --> 15:51.849
I don't care how much
those kinds of roles pay.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.819
A lot.
You know Booger
from<i> Revenge of the Nerds?</i>

15:54.821 --> 15:57.288
Well,
Booger has two Jet Skis,

15:57.290 --> 15:58.623
one you sit,
one you stand.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.626
Wait. You're the one
who wanted those
hunked-out photos

16:01.628 --> 16:03.027
to prove to her
that I wasn't a nerd.

16:03.029 --> 16:05.463
Adam, look at me.
Look at your mama.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.198
You are not a nerd.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.735
No, you look at me,
right in my lazy eye.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.237
I am a nerd.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.339
Never.
Say it.

16:14.341 --> 16:16.140
Over my dead body.

16:16.142 --> 16:19.077
You know, sometimes
you get so caught up

16:19.079 --> 16:20.712
in what is you want for me,

16:20.714 --> 16:22.613
that you forget what I want.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.049
Thanks for killing
my dream.

16:29.022 --> 16:32.557
ADULT ADAM:<i> It had been a day</i>
<i> since Barry nearly lost an eye</i>
<i> to punk rock,</i>

16:32.559 --> 16:34.792
<i> but he'd stop at nothing</i>
<i> to impress Lainey.</i>

16:34.794 --> 16:38.196
Before you say anything,
my spikes
are supposed to be blue

16:38.198 --> 16:40.832
and the hair dye
messed up my vision
for about a week.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.335
Barring that, I'm looking
pretty punk rock, right?

16:44.337 --> 16:45.136
Nope.
Zero.

16:45.138 --> 16:46.337
It's kind of hard
to look at, bro.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.772
Stop.
Don't discourage the man.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.241
It's just a little more
pumpkin-y than punk.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.044
But wear this
until it grows out.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.246
Aside from the hair,
what about the rest?

16:55.248 --> 16:57.715
Do I look like Johnny Rotten
or Sid Vicious.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.883
You look like a pirate,
dude.

16:58.885 --> 17:00.551
Your girl won't say it,
but we will.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.552
No, I'll say it.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.321
I went too far
and now you're a pirate.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.756
And you think that's hot?

17:04.758 --> 17:06.257
I gotta go find a way
to fix this.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.159
But I did this for you,
damn it.

17:08.161 --> 17:08.626
(GROANING)

17:08.628 --> 17:11.329
Oh, he just said "argh."
That's a thing a pirate says.

17:11.331 --> 17:13.464
And he's hopping on one foot
like he's got a peg leg.

17:13.466 --> 17:16.200
(LAUGHTER)
This is all your fault,
Matt Bradley.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.802
Wait,
what are you wearing?

17:17.804 --> 17:20.138
Yeah, watching you try
too hard to be punk

17:20.140 --> 17:22.340
made me realize
I need to mellow out.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.174
That's why
I'm a Deadhead now.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.943
The Grateful Dead
is the opposite of punk.
For sure.

17:25.945 --> 17:29.047
If you ask me, you guys need
a chill member of the JTP.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.114
ALL: JTP.
See?

17:30.116 --> 17:32.016
Okay, guys, can we pivot
to my thing, here?

17:32.018 --> 17:33.251
I'm, I'm kind of going
through some stuff.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.286
Good idea. Let's divert
the attention from me.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.488
It's just,
I've liked Erica forever,

17:37.490 --> 17:40.124
but I'm with Evy now,
and I love her.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.726
Then, that's your answer
right there, man.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.929
At the end of the day,
all that matters
is that you're honest

17:44.931 --> 17:46.697
and listen to your heart.

17:46.699 --> 17:47.265
Wow.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.934
That's so deep
and Jerry Garcia of you.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.237
I'm a pirate.

17:53.239 --> 17:54.505
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As Barry failed at punk,</i>

17:54.507 --> 17:57.909
<i> my mom was trying</i>
<i> to win back her little star.</i>

17:58.978 --> 18:00.278
Schmoopy.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.412
Schmoopaloo.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.847
Schmoopy-booper.

18:02.849 --> 18:03.681
Schmoop de jour.

18:03.683 --> 18:07.051
Schmoopy doopy poopy soupy,
have a scoopy.

18:07.053 --> 18:10.688
Stop saying variations
of "schmoo" and go away.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.560
Listen, I know I shouldn't
have lied to you.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.463
And if the only way
you're gonna forgive me

18:18.465 --> 18:20.565
is to say that thing
you want me to say,

18:20.567 --> 18:22.700
then I will say it.

18:22.702 --> 18:25.103
You are a... Oh, nope.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.504
I, I'm sorry.
I can't say it.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.840
Well, at some point,
you'll have to.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.074
No.

18:30.176 --> 18:35.480
You will always be my amazing,
handsome leading man.

18:35.482 --> 18:38.649
But if everyone else
sees you as a nerd,

18:40.420 --> 18:41.152
then you go out

18:41.154 --> 18:45.123
and you be the best nerd
the world has ever seen.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.893
Deal.

18:49.295 --> 18:53.231
ADULT ADAM:<i> As my mom was</i>
<i> finally facing the fact</i>
<i> that I wasn't a leading man,</i>

18:53.233 --> 18:55.333
<i> Erica was coming to terms</i>
<i> with the fact</i>

18:55.335 --> 18:57.702
<i> that Geoff</i>
<i> might not be hers.</i>

18:59.072 --> 19:01.706
Hey.
We gotta talk.

19:04.477 --> 19:07.845
If it's about what my dad
said, we really don't.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.580
I really think
we should.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.381
Geoff, come on.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.317
You know my dad
is utterly clueless.

19:13.319 --> 19:13.885
True.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.286
I mean, what does my dad
always call you?

19:15.288 --> 19:18.156
Jeremy or Jack.
He called me Jorf once.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.057
That's not even a name.
(CHUCKLES)

19:20.059 --> 19:23.194
So, yeah,
he's, like, dead wrong.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.796
Well, okay, um,
that's a relief,

19:25.798 --> 19:29.066
'cause I'm with Evy now
and we're really happy.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.202
And I'm happy
for you guys.

19:32.438 --> 19:33.771
Cool.

19:33.973 --> 19:35.706
Glad I checked in.

19:35.708 --> 19:36.574
Me, too.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.809
<i> ¶ When people keep repeating</i>

19:38.811 --> 19:42.146
<i> ¶ That you'll never</i>
<i> fall in love</i>

19:42.148 --> 19:45.016
<i> ¶ When everybody keeps</i>
<i> retreating</i>

19:45.018 --> 19:46.217
<i> ¶ But you can't seem</i>

19:46.219 --> 19:47.685
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Sometimes we hide our feelings</i>

19:47.687 --> 19:49.987
<i> to protect ourselves</i>
<i> from the unknown,</i>

19:49.989 --> 19:51.856
<i> even though</i>
<i> we know it will hurt.</i>

19:51.858 --> 19:53.457
<i> But even worse</i>
<i> than getting hurt</i>

19:53.459 --> 19:56.460
<i> is not listening</i>

20:00.133 --> 20:01.065
I was just...

20:01.067 --> 20:02.266
Me, too.
<i> ¶ To your heart ¶</i>

20:02.268 --> 20:03.534
ADULT ADAM:

20:03.536 --> 20:07.238

20:08.041 --> 20:10.074
<i> ¶ To your heart</i>

20:14.214 --> 20:15.413
<i> ¶ To your heart ¶</i>

20:15.415 --> 20:19.417
This is gonna make things
super awkward and confusing.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.985
For sure.

20:21.154 --> 20:25.022
ADULT ADAM:
<i> In the end, love can come</i>

20:25.024 --> 20:27.825

20:27.827 --> 20:29.327
Uh, Dad.

20:30.630 --> 20:34.999
Listen, I know I screwed up
with these stupid things,

20:35.001 --> 20:36.634
but, uh...

20:38.338 --> 20:40.438
Thank you for making
a mess of things.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.205
So, you're not mad at me?

20:41.207 --> 20:44.308
You know, it actually kind of
worked out for the best.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.777
I knew it would,
Erica Dorothy Goldberg.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.045
No, you didn't.

20:55.555 --> 20:59.156
I never saw
<i> Meatballs</i> part one,
but I'm very confused.

20:59.158 --> 21:00.958
So am I.
Where's Bill Murray,

21:00.960 --> 21:03.227
and why is there an alien
in their bunk?

21:03.229 --> 21:04.595
This makes no sense.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.763
Of course it does.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.999
All camps have
end-of-the-summer
boxing matches

21:08.001 --> 21:10.701
to determine who gets
the rights to the lake.

21:11.070 --> 21:11.669
Why is
the photo guy here?

21:11.671 --> 21:14.438
We're taking new headshots
to get you into<i> Meatballs III,</i>

21:14.440 --> 21:17.074
so we needed to see
what we're aiming for.

21:17.176 --> 21:19.477
I'm just gonna focus on
writing.
