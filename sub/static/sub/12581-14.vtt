00:35.392 --> 00:36.359
You know what?

00:36.393 --> 00:38.156
This is just
the right pace.

00:38.194 --> 00:40.389
Especially
after our last outing.

00:40.430 --> 00:42.261
Two Piña Coladas in Minh

00:42.298 --> 00:44.459
and she starts talking
about stealing a car.

00:44.501 --> 00:45.627
(giggles)

00:45.668 --> 00:47.033
Dark rum make me crazy.

00:47.070 --> 00:48.537
(giggles)

00:48.571 --> 00:54.305
(speaking Laotian)

00:54.344 --> 00:56.073
What did she say?

00:56.112 --> 00:57.204
She think your
feet lovely

00:57.247 --> 01:00.978
and it an honor
to work on them.

01:01.017 --> 01:02.484
(groans)

01:03.953 --> 01:09.892
Now where in the heck
did I park my... this way.

01:09.926 --> 01:13.692
My memory trick
is usually fail-safe.

01:13.730 --> 01:15.163
When we got out of the car

01:15.198 --> 01:18.133
I associated the parking section
with William Shakespeare.

01:18.168 --> 01:21.296
So, naturally, the car
should be parked in "2B,"

01:21.337 --> 01:23.897
unless I was thinking
of "not 2B."

01:23.940 --> 01:27.501
(Gus laughing)
Will you look
at those delinquents,

01:27.544 --> 01:29.705
horsing around
with those shopping carts?

01:29.746 --> 01:30.735
I bet they're...

01:30.780 --> 01:32.873
Oh, my God, it's Bobby.

01:32.916 --> 01:34.406
(ells)

01:34.451 --> 01:36.442
(laughing):
Oh, man.

01:36.486 --> 01:37.453
Bobby?
Joseph.

01:37.487 --> 01:40.456
This is what you are doing
in your after-school program?

01:40.490 --> 01:43.152
Program was shut down, dude...
budget cuts.

01:43.193 --> 01:45.457
So we're playing
shopping cart chicken.

01:45.495 --> 01:47.963
Hey, we can get them to push us.

01:47.997 --> 01:49.123
No after-school program?

01:49.165 --> 01:51.099
Now who Connie
gonna tutor?

01:51.134 --> 01:52.658
Bums in rail yard?

01:52.702 --> 01:53.828
This is ridiculous.

01:53.870 --> 01:56.600
Our kids should be enriching
their minds,

01:56.639 --> 01:59.733
not using a parking lot
as a playground.

01:59.776 --> 02:02.074
Something has got to be done.

02:02.111 --> 02:04.807
The people who canceled
that after-school program

02:04.848 --> 02:08.340
are going to wish
we never found our car.

02:08.383 --> 02:10.318
Where is that frickin' thing?

02:10.353 --> 02:12.878
NANCY:
We have a real issue here.

02:12.922 --> 02:15.550
That after-school program
is important.

02:15.592 --> 02:16.559
Absolutely.

02:16.593 --> 02:17.582
Our kids get out of school

02:17.627 --> 02:19.595
in the middle of the day
when they air

02:19.629 --> 02:22.154
all those sex and drug-filled
after-school specials.

02:22.198 --> 02:25.258
Oh, Peggy, let's take this
to the school board tomorrow.

02:25.301 --> 02:27.269
They're not going
to know what hit 'em!

02:27.303 --> 02:28.270
Well, I got to tell you,

02:28.304 --> 02:30.363
your initiative is
really impressing me.

02:30.406 --> 02:32.374
And not just
because you're ladies.

02:32.408 --> 02:35.639
Okay, girls, hands
in the middle, let's go.

02:35.678 --> 02:37.111
"For the children," on three.

02:37.146 --> 02:38.113
Ready?

02:38.147 --> 02:39.114
One, two, three...

02:39.148 --> 02:44.211
ALL:
For the children!

02:44.254 --> 02:48.122
For me!

02:48.157 --> 02:50.717
Oh, I bet this must be very
exciting for you, Minh.

02:50.760 --> 02:51.920
Where you're from,
you probably

02:51.961 --> 02:54.020
didn't have the freedom
to criticize your government.

02:54.063 --> 02:56.429
Why would I criticize
government in Laos?

02:56.466 --> 02:57.797
My father was general.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.563
I do what I want.

02:59.602 --> 03:01.570
I was peasant's
worst nightmare.

03:01.604 --> 03:03.037
Thank you, Mrs. Chapman.

03:03.072 --> 03:05.632
Your request to ban
sections "F" and "S"

03:05.675 --> 03:07.870
from the library dictionary
has been noted.

03:07.911 --> 03:13.872
Okay, everybody have
their talking points?

03:15.952 --> 03:16.919
Yeah.

03:16.953 --> 03:18.921
Oh, one little thing though,
Peggy Hill.

03:18.955 --> 03:19.922
Keep it short.

03:19.956 --> 03:21.981
Sometimes you go on
and on and on.

03:22.025 --> 03:25.188
I find it charming, but you
might lose other people.

03:25.228 --> 03:27.423
Good advice.

03:27.463 --> 03:30.159
And you probably should not
call anyone "hillbilly."

03:30.199 --> 03:31.325
Or redneck.

03:31.367 --> 03:32.561
Or dumb monkey.

03:32.602 --> 03:34.229
Check.

03:34.270 --> 03:37.967
Well, I guess that does it
for tonight’s meeting.

03:38.007 --> 03:38.974
Nice work.

03:39.008 --> 03:39.975
Excuse me.

03:40.009 --> 03:41.977
Peggy Hill and the coalition

03:42.011 --> 03:44.445
to save the after-school program
at Tom Landry.

03:44.480 --> 03:52.251
Sorry, Mrs. Hill, but these
meetings last from 6:00 to 8:00

03:52.288 --> 03:55.052
and it is now...

03:55.091 --> 03:56.058
8:00.

03:56.092 --> 03:57.184
Oh, great.

03:57.226 --> 04:00.354
Now, Connie gonna end up
smashing carts

04:00.396 --> 04:02.364
like brain-dead delinquents.

04:02.398 --> 04:03.365
No offense.

04:03.399 --> 04:04.366
None taken.

04:04.400 --> 04:05.367
I wasn't even listening.

04:05.401 --> 04:07.392
Now, here's the game plan.

04:07.437 --> 04:09.769
We take things
to the next level.

04:09.806 --> 04:11.433
New T-shirts?

04:11.474 --> 04:13.066
(chuckles):
No.

04:13.109 --> 04:14.076
Sweatshirts?

04:14.110 --> 04:15.077
Not yet.

04:15.111 --> 04:17.375
What we have to do is get
on the school board.

04:17.413 --> 04:19.813
There is a seat open
and an election coming up.

04:19.849 --> 04:22.374
Do you really think
we can win an election?

04:22.418 --> 04:23.385
I know we can.

04:23.419 --> 04:24.477
You know, the turnout

04:24.520 --> 04:26.613
in these things
is always very low.

04:26.656 --> 04:29.955
The secret is to find a group
of voters that feels overlooked.

04:29.993 --> 04:30.960
Then look at them.

04:30.994 --> 04:33.861
And I can get votes
from Laotian community.

04:33.896 --> 04:36.387
I give $5.00 tip
on French manicure.

04:36.432 --> 04:37.899
I'm the Lady Di.

04:37.934 --> 04:40.334
Well, I warned the folks
over at Shady Pines Trailer Park

04:40.370 --> 04:41.735
about that tornado.

04:41.771 --> 04:43.966
They were so grateful they're
still naming dogs after me.

04:44.007 --> 04:44.974
Great.

04:45.008 --> 04:47.135
We've got pockets of votes
in the Laotian community

04:47.176 --> 04:48.370
and in the trailer parks.

04:48.411 --> 04:53.610
Then I score county-wide with
my two-year teaching degree.

04:53.650 --> 04:56.847
NANCY:
I wonder which one
of us should run.

04:56.886 --> 04:58.183
I mean, Peggy's
a ball of fire

04:58.221 --> 05:00.689
and Minh, she's
smart as a whip.

05:00.723 --> 05:02.691
Either way, our kids
are in such good hands.

05:02.725 --> 05:04.556
198, 199...

05:04.594 --> 05:09.725
Hey, these are supposed to be
200-thread count sheets.

05:09.766 --> 05:10.858
Damn Egyptians.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.461
But, Minh, three women
can’t fill one position.

05:14.504 --> 05:17.405
This school board seat,
not Boomhauer's hot tub.

05:17.440 --> 05:20.603
Well, when you think about it,
I'm most logical choice.

05:20.643 --> 05:22.440
My daughter a proven genius,

05:22.478 --> 05:24.446
plus my perfectly
symmetrical face

05:24.480 --> 05:26.880
is pleasing to voters
and inspires trust.

05:26.916 --> 05:31.751
And it sure would be nice to
finally get a Laotian in power.

05:31.788 --> 05:33.756
We got to eat
their fish on Friday,

05:33.790 --> 05:35.758
they gonna eat our rice
noodles on Wednesday...

05:35.792 --> 05:37.453
for breakfast.

05:37.493 --> 05:39.825
You've got the most
school-related experience,

05:39.862 --> 05:41.693
the best interpersonal skills

05:41.731 --> 05:43.699
and a smile
that lights up a room.

05:43.733 --> 05:48.432
Yep, Peggy, I got to say, I
agree with all your reasons

05:48.471 --> 05:50.996
why you should be the one
to run for school board.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.098
Well, thank you, Hank,

05:52.141 --> 05:54.109
but let's not lose sight
of why I'm doing this.

05:54.143 --> 05:56.668
It's for the children.

05:56.713 --> 05:58.681
Now, I'm not saying
Minh hates children,

05:58.715 --> 06:01.309
but I really love children.

06:01.350 --> 06:04.808
They are three out of the five
points in my five-point plan.

06:04.854 --> 06:07.880
I haven't quite figured
out the other two yet.

06:07.924 --> 06:10.620
I'm thinking something
about America.

06:10.660 --> 06:12.719
Wow, dynamite.

06:12.762 --> 06:15.390
Even though Dale
says Principal Moss

06:15.431 --> 06:16.796
may try to assassinate us

06:16.833 --> 06:18.801
I think this is going
to be nothing but fun.

06:18.835 --> 06:20.769
I can't wait to get started.

06:20.803 --> 06:23.567
I have so many ideas,
I couldn’t sleep all night.

06:23.606 --> 06:25.403
So I make pecan sandies.

06:25.441 --> 06:27.068
I appreciate
your enthusiasm.

06:27.110 --> 06:29.704
Now, it's obvious who
our candidate should be,

06:29.746 --> 06:32.738
but it would be presumptuous of
me to do the nominating, so...

06:32.782 --> 06:36.081
I'm not sure
how obvious it is.

06:36.119 --> 06:37.916
Oh, you mean me?

06:37.954 --> 06:39.148
(gasps)

06:39.188 --> 06:42.885
Well, I'm not sure
I'm the person for the job.

06:42.925 --> 06:46.656
Well, somebody got
to do it for the children

06:46.696 --> 06:49.961
and if no one else
wants to run...

06:49.999 --> 06:51.227
No one?

06:51.267 --> 06:53.292
(gasping):
Five points!

06:53.336 --> 06:54.530
(coughing)

06:54.570 --> 06:56.197
All in favor of me?

06:56.239 --> 06:57.206
Well...

06:57.240 --> 06:58.298
Thank you, Peggy.
Nancy?

06:58.341 --> 07:00.809
Well, since Peggy's
okay with it.

07:00.843 --> 07:02.435
Okay then, done deal.

07:02.478 --> 07:03.445
Oh.

07:03.479 --> 07:04.446
Hold on.

07:04.480 --> 07:07.449
Not that I want the job
or anything, but...

07:07.483 --> 07:09.110
Then don't sweat it.

07:09.152 --> 07:12.019
Oh, and I wouldn't
drink from there.

07:12.054 --> 07:14.113
Doggy has a cold.

07:14.157 --> 07:15.317
(sneezes)

07:15.358 --> 07:17.019
PEGGY:
And I can't help

07:17.059 --> 07:20.358
but think that Minh
did it on purpose.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.830
Those pecan sandies
were astonishingly dry.

07:22.865 --> 07:26.232
Come on, Peggy,
they're not shy people.

07:26.269 --> 07:27.600
If Minh wanted to choke you,

07:27.637 --> 07:30.333
she would have just reached over
and done it with her hands.

07:30.373 --> 07:31.635
I will give her that.

07:31.674 --> 07:34.643
You know, Peggy, you could still
be the power behind the scenes.

07:34.677 --> 07:37.009
Just like that little fellow
in the Wizard of Oz.

07:37.046 --> 07:39.241
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.

07:39.282 --> 07:42.615
And maybe next election,
I can run another candidate.

07:42.652 --> 07:43.619
Then another.

07:43.653 --> 07:44.119
Before you know it,

07:44.153 --> 07:48.954
I'll be running the entire city
from my bathtub.

08:09.745 --> 08:10.370
Mrs. Soup
and Mrs. Gribble

08:10.413 --> 08:11.505
are waiting
in the living room.

08:11.547 --> 08:12.514
Here's breakfast.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.778
And I typed up the monologues
from Leno and Letterman.

08:14.817 --> 08:15.784
Good work.

08:15.818 --> 08:17.786
Now, I need you to highlight
last weeks Doonesburys

08:17.820 --> 08:19.344
and tell me
why they're funny.

08:19.388 --> 08:20.582
Peggy, are we
out of butter?

08:20.623 --> 08:22.181
It's behind the cottage cheese.

08:22.225 --> 08:25.558
Behind the cottage cheese.

08:25.595 --> 08:27.620
Okay, people, I'm glad
to see you're all here.

08:27.663 --> 08:29.426
Now, let's...

08:29.465 --> 08:31.296
(phone rings)

08:31.334 --> 08:32.528
War room.

08:32.568 --> 08:33.761
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

08:33.803 --> 08:34.996
Thank you.

08:35.037 --> 08:36.868
That was Bobby.

08:36.905 --> 08:39.966
He was testing the line.

08:40.009 --> 08:41.236
It works.

08:41.277 --> 08:44.542
Okay, first off, we're going
to need to make some signs.

08:44.580 --> 08:46.548
Oh, we’re just about
done making signs, sug.

08:46.582 --> 08:48.812
PEGGY:
"Minh to win."

08:48.851 --> 08:49.818
I don't get it.

08:49.852 --> 08:50.944
What not to get?

08:50.987 --> 08:52.852
I'm Minh.
I want to win.

08:52.889 --> 08:55.983
Hmm. Maybe we should
focus group that.

08:56.025 --> 08:56.992
Nope, no go.

08:57.026 --> 08:59.654
Women 18 to 45
will be turned off.

08:59.695 --> 09:01.686
Here's what we're going to do.

09:01.731 --> 09:05.030
You know what would be
a big help, Peggy Hill?

09:05.067 --> 09:06.034
Starbucks run.

09:06.068 --> 09:07.399
Oh, I'll have
a Frappuccino.

09:07.436 --> 09:08.733
BOBBY:
Bag of madeleines.

09:08.771 --> 09:11.103
I'm all for Minh
running for office,

09:11.140 --> 09:13.768
but she better not
take my guns away.

09:13.809 --> 09:15.800
She's running
for the school board.

09:15.845 --> 09:18.473
Then she better not take
Joseph's guns away.

09:18.514 --> 09:22.109
Well, I'm not crazy
about making holes in my lawn

09:22.151 --> 09:24.119
but I guess it's
for the children.

09:24.153 --> 09:26.451
You know, my lawn
is already dead,

09:26.489 --> 09:31.927
maybe we could put
all the signs there.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.929
No offense, Bill, but this
campaign is about hope.

09:33.963 --> 09:34.930
Oh. Right.

09:34.964 --> 09:37.865
I'm not saying you have to use
the moment of silence to pray.

09:37.900 --> 09:40.835
The kids who don't believe
in God can just sit quietly

09:40.870 --> 09:43.202
and smirk about how they've
got it all figured out.

09:43.239 --> 09:46.140
(smattering of applause)

09:46.175 --> 09:47.802
Thank you, Mrs. Chapman.

09:47.843 --> 09:49.572
The next question is for Minh...

09:49.612 --> 09:55.244
Sou-vnifnin-phone.

09:56.185 --> 09:57.709
Hello, everybody.

09:57.753 --> 10:01.086
And to my Laotian friends,
sabaai-dii.

10:01.123 --> 10:02.021
Yeah, you been talking

10:02.058 --> 10:03.685
about keeping
the after-school program going.

10:03.726 --> 10:07.457
I think I hear the sound
of my property taxes going up.

10:07.496 --> 10:10.488
And you fat cats with
your pie-in-the-sky programs

10:10.533 --> 10:12.501
and your free
prescription drugs.

10:12.535 --> 10:13.502
No, no, no.

10:13.536 --> 10:15.197
That's not me.

10:15.237 --> 10:17.296
I do not want to increase taxes.

10:17.340 --> 10:19.137
Yeah, sure,
you'd love it.

10:19.175 --> 10:20.142
No, no.

10:20.176 --> 10:21.336
You not listening, Jethro.

10:21.377 --> 10:22.776
Oh, this is ugly.

10:22.812 --> 10:24.973
Someone has to stop
the bleeding.

10:25.014 --> 10:27.539
What my candidate
is trying to say

10:27.583 --> 10:31.519
is that we will cut the fat
and leave the muscle.

10:31.554 --> 10:34.045
I know what I'm
trying to say.

10:34.090 --> 10:35.887
It's what I just say.

10:35.925 --> 10:38.086
Please bear with my candidate.

10:38.127 --> 10:40.527
Obviously, English is
not her first language.

10:40.563 --> 10:42.531
But how about a hand
for her courage?

10:42.565 --> 10:43.532
Oh, you crazy?

10:43.566 --> 10:45.534
Get out of here.

10:48.237 --> 10:49.795
The thing to remember, people,

10:49.839 --> 10:52.330
is that you are not going
to have to tighten your belts

10:52.375 --> 10:55.367
because we are going
to fix the pants!

10:55.411 --> 10:56.503
Give me that.

10:56.545 --> 10:57.637
You need me.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.772
Fix the pants!

10:58.814 --> 11:02.215
Uh, can I ask the candidate
a question?

11:02.251 --> 11:05.743
What are you going to do
to raise educational standards?

11:05.788 --> 11:06.982
MAN:
Without raising taxes.

11:07.023 --> 11:09.992
MAN 2:
Fat cats!

11:10.026 --> 11:11.994
Let's see how you
handle this one.

11:12.028 --> 11:15.327
We all concerned about
educational standards

11:15.364 --> 11:18.561
and I tell you where the
problem is... the teachers.

11:18.601 --> 11:21.695
Did you know
our school system

11:21.737 --> 11:23.932
require only two-year degree

11:23.973 --> 11:25.440
to be substitute
teacher?

11:25.474 --> 11:26.771
MAN:
Is that true?

11:26.809 --> 11:27.776
So you want to know

11:27.810 --> 11:29.937
how I raise standards
without raising taxes?

11:29.979 --> 11:33.346
I tell you after I
look into your hearts

11:33.382 --> 11:34.872
and you look
into mine.

11:34.917 --> 11:36.885
No teacher, full-time
or substitute

11:36.919 --> 11:38.409
can teach our kids

11:38.454 --> 11:41.184
without having
a four-year college degree.

11:41.223 --> 11:42.315
(cheering)

11:42.358 --> 11:45.486
MAN:
That's exactly what I
needed to hear today.

11:45.528 --> 11:48.258
Wait.
I only have a two-year degree.

11:48.297 --> 11:49.264
Pants!

11:49.298 --> 11:50.265
Children!

11:50.299 --> 11:51.266
America!

11:51.300 --> 11:53.268
(applause and cheering
continue)

11:53.302 --> 11:55.270
PEGGY:
She's taking teaching
away from me.

11:55.304 --> 11:56.271
That's my life.

11:56.305 --> 11:57.272
How dare she?

11:57.306 --> 11:59.274
I groomed her,
I taught her everything

11:59.308 --> 12:01.401
and she has the nerve
to stab me in the back.

12:01.444 --> 12:04.345
That is just not done
in politics, Hank.

12:04.380 --> 12:06.348
There's no way I'm going
back to college.

12:06.382 --> 12:07.349
I'm a teacher.

12:07.383 --> 12:09.715
I'm done learning.

12:11.020 --> 12:12.920
Can you believe
that woman?

12:12.955 --> 12:15.185
I'm real sorry
what happened to you, sug,

12:15.224 --> 12:16.248
but the important thing

12:16.292 --> 12:18.760
is to keep the after-school
program alive, right?

12:18.794 --> 12:19.852
The what?

12:19.895 --> 12:21.192
Oh, yeah, of course.

12:21.230 --> 12:25.326
For the children, but can we
really trust Minh to deliver?

12:25.367 --> 12:27.335
I mean, come on,
this is a woman who makes

12:27.369 --> 12:29.269
dumb blonde jokes
behind your back.

12:29.305 --> 12:31.796
Minh makes dumb blonde jokes
behind my back?

12:31.841 --> 12:34.332
Hey, don't drag me into
your little cat fight.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.936
I just came over to save
the after-school program.

12:36.979 --> 12:38.810
Oh, that witch!

12:38.848 --> 12:39.940
Here's what
I'm thinking:

12:39.982 --> 12:41.313
We dig up some
dirt on Minh,

12:41.350 --> 12:44.376
and you do an exposé
on the local news.

12:44.420 --> 12:47.082
Then, after her support
is totally gone,

12:47.123 --> 12:48.522
I jump into the race

12:48.557 --> 12:51.549
(yelling):
And give that freakin' dog
the beating of her life!

12:51.594 --> 12:53.061
Well, I don't know.

12:53.095 --> 12:56.087
That kind of reporting
isn't really my arena.

12:56.132 --> 12:58.760
Nancy, how much
longer do you think

12:58.801 --> 13:01.793
you can milk this sexy
"weather girl" act?

13:01.837 --> 13:03.702
Two, three...
two years tops?

13:03.739 --> 13:06.731
This is your chance
to be taken seriously.

13:06.775 --> 13:08.242
Get on the air

13:08.277 --> 13:11.474
and deliver the
biggest news flash
of your career...

13:11.514 --> 13:12.913
"Peggy Hill is running
for school board!"

13:12.948 --> 13:15.246
Well, I do want
to be taken seriously,

13:15.284 --> 13:16.683
and I have some ideas...

13:16.719 --> 13:18.914
Oh, honey,
I'm sure you do.

13:18.954 --> 13:20.717
It’s just that no one
ever listens to me...

13:20.756 --> 13:23.452
Okay, okay. We have to
think constructively

13:23.492 --> 13:25.153
and get emotional
about this.

13:25.194 --> 13:26.991
Now, how do we
destroy Minh?

13:27.029 --> 13:28.394
Oh, there she is.

13:28.430 --> 13:29.727
(tightly):
Smile and wave.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.665
Smile and wave.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.965
I bury you.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.465
NANCY:
What are they
saying, Dale?

13:40.509 --> 13:44.741
Kahn is asking Minh
to pass the potatoes.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.747
Oh, come on!

13:45.781 --> 13:47.749
I need something
juicier than that!

13:47.783 --> 13:51.742
I tried to slip
in their house as a paperboy,

13:51.787 --> 13:54.381
but Mr. Souphanousinphone
recognized me.

13:54.423 --> 13:57.586
But I grabbed their garbage.

13:57.626 --> 14:04.623
Huh. Look who's too good
to hang onto a Sizzler coupon.

14:04.667 --> 14:05.861
What do we have here?

14:05.901 --> 14:06.868
Come to Mama.

14:06.902 --> 14:09.666
NANCY (on TV):
And that cold front

14:09.705 --> 14:11.866
looks like
it wants to stay put

14:11.907 --> 14:13.135
right through the weekend.

14:13.175 --> 14:16.269
So while there might be
a "spring" in your step,

14:16.312 --> 14:17.870
there's none in the forecast.

14:17.913 --> 14:18.880
Mu bien, Nancy.

14:18.914 --> 14:21.644
Just how much fun
is a barrel of monkeys?

14:21.684 --> 14:22.912
Well, two radio DJs...

14:22.952 --> 14:24.510
And Miguel,
here's some advice

14:24.553 --> 14:26.521
on the upcoming
school board election.

14:26.555 --> 14:28.455
I'd think again if
you're planning

14:28.490 --> 14:30.458
on voting for Minh
Souphanousinphone.

14:30.492 --> 14:31.959
I don't think these are

14:31.994 --> 14:33.962
the kinds
of pay-per-view programs

14:33.996 --> 14:36.123
that a friend of the children
should be watching.

14:36.165 --> 14:37.359
(Kahn screams)

14:37.399 --> 14:38.957
I told you,
Minh, but no!

14:39.001 --> 14:41.196
You just had to see
"Hobos Boxing."

14:41.237 --> 14:43.205
...no grasp on finances.
Oh, yeah!

14:43.239 --> 14:45.207
Fortunately,
there is an alternative.

14:45.241 --> 14:47.732
I know someone who'd
be perfect for the job.

14:47.776 --> 14:50.006
She's a dedicated parent,
she's smart,

14:50.045 --> 14:52.013
and she's more than
just a pretty face.

14:52.047 --> 14:53.139
She's me!

14:53.182 --> 14:55.150
Nancy Hicks-Gribble!
Pick Hicks!

14:55.184 --> 14:56.913
What?!

14:56.952 --> 14:58.010
NANCY:
And if elected...

14:58.053 --> 14:59.350
Oh, well.

14:59.388 --> 15:00.855
...to turn
Arlen's schools into...

15:00.889 --> 15:02.413
Wait! I'm running, too!

15:02.458 --> 15:04.619
Peggy Hill for school board!

15:04.660 --> 15:07.993
(groans)
PEGGY:
These are my people!

15:08.030 --> 15:11.227
They want to hear me speak!
Arlen!

15:23.512 --> 15:26.879
Peggy, do I have these
in the right order?

15:26.915 --> 15:27.882
You better.

15:27.916 --> 15:28.814
Here comes someone.

15:28.851 --> 15:31.217
Big smiles!

15:31.253 --> 15:34.279
Oh, it's only Kahn.

15:34.323 --> 15:37.087
Ow, ow, ow!

15:37.126 --> 15:40.618
(singsong):
Go to hell.

15:40.663 --> 15:42.824
Phase two complete!

15:42.865 --> 15:45.231
Van rented,
ready to pick up constituents

15:45.267 --> 15:46.598
and sweep election!

15:46.635 --> 15:49.627
Phase three... ha.
A victory dance!

15:49.672 --> 15:52.732
(singing merrily)

15:52.775 --> 15:54.140
You rent minivan?

15:54.176 --> 15:55.575
What you thinking?!

15:55.611 --> 15:57.442
Minivan seats seven people.

15:57.479 --> 16:00.277
I need 15 to swing election.

16:00.316 --> 16:04.650
How much Peggy Hill
paying you to be jackass?

16:04.687 --> 16:06.086
Something's wrong
with the bug.

16:06.121 --> 16:09.716
I can't hear a thing,
but I see they have a new van.

16:09.758 --> 16:12.158
I bet they're using it
to bus their constituents

16:12.194 --> 16:13.491
to the polling place!

16:13.529 --> 16:16.157
DALE (over microphone):
Well, we'll out van them,

16:16.198 --> 16:18.166
but we’ll keep ours
in the garage.

16:18.200 --> 16:19.565
They'll never see it coming.

16:19.601 --> 16:21.762
Idiots!

16:21.804 --> 16:22.771
(Dale laughing)

16:22.805 --> 16:23.863
Why isn't this working?

16:23.906 --> 16:25.271
I rewired it myself.

16:25.307 --> 16:28.208
You better
get out of here, Gribble!

16:28.243 --> 16:31.474
I am this close
to kicking your ass!

16:31.513 --> 16:33.174
No one threatens me.

16:33.215 --> 16:36.514
I am this close to kicking
our ass!

16:36.552 --> 16:37.519
Oh, yeah?

16:37.553 --> 16:41.319
Well, now I'm this close
to kicking your ass!

16:41.357 --> 16:43.052
Let's settle this like men.

16:43.092 --> 16:45.117
Hank, whose fingers
are closer?

16:45.160 --> 16:46.184
Whoa, whoa.

16:46.228 --> 16:48.696
Just because our wives
are at each other's throats

16:48.731 --> 16:50.062
doesn't mean we have to be.

16:50.099 --> 16:51.464
Oh, easy for you to say.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.524
Your wife a loser.

16:52.568 --> 16:54.126
Now, now, Kahn,

16:54.169 --> 16:55.466
maybe Hank's right.

16:55.504 --> 16:58.473
I say we let bygones be...
(ells)

16:58.507 --> 17:00.338
Sneak attack! I win!

17:00.376 --> 17:08.078
I'm so hungry and tired
I messed up the last 50 buttons.

17:08.117 --> 17:10.744
Bobby's out, Hank's in.

17:10.786 --> 17:14.744
Fine. When are we
having dinner?

17:14.790 --> 17:16.758
It's 9:15.

17:16.791 --> 17:18.089
(groans)

17:18.127 --> 17:21.425
Fine. Here's $10. Go.

17:21.463 --> 17:22.724
(grunts)

17:22.765 --> 17:26.064
DALE:
All right, Joseph, easy.

17:26.101 --> 17:27.068
Easy.

17:27.102 --> 17:30.003
Joseph, stop! The sign!

17:30.038 --> 17:31.335
(clattering)

17:31.373 --> 17:33.000
So, they have a van.

17:33.041 --> 17:36.374
Okay, Hank,
Minh has her support here.

17:36.412 --> 17:40.041
I'll concede Little Laos to her.

17:40.082 --> 17:41.913
Nancy's support is...

17:41.950 --> 17:43.315
well, she's been blathering

17:43.352 --> 17:45.320
about all the dogs
named after her

17:45.354 --> 17:46.321
in this trailer park.

17:46.355 --> 17:47.322
Which leaves...

17:47.356 --> 17:49.324
all of this... for me.

17:49.358 --> 17:50.325
Hank

17:50.359 --> 17:52.884
we're going to need
a bus.

17:52.928 --> 17:55.158
We're not spending
money to rent a bus.

17:55.197 --> 18:02.126
(yelling):
It's for the
freakin' children!

18:02.171 --> 18:04.639
Hank, the phone poll numbers
are not good.

18:04.673 --> 18:06.766
The projections show Nancy
with four votes,

18:06.809 --> 18:10.176
Minh also with four votes,
and Peggy Hill... zero.

18:10.212 --> 18:12.646
Now, I can increase my margin
of error to five votes,

18:12.681 --> 18:15.673
but even then, I am just winning
by the skin of my teeth.

18:15.717 --> 18:17.947
Well, when people see
that flyer you put

18:17.986 --> 18:18.953
in the Penny Saver...

18:18.987 --> 18:20.955
That doesn't come out
until after election day!

18:20.989 --> 18:22.980
Now, I need
to motivate my base...

18:23.025 --> 18:25.926
the hard-core constituents
who would fight and die for me.

18:25.961 --> 18:28.088
Hank, you have
to make me a base!

18:28.130 --> 18:29.722
Call your customers!

18:29.765 --> 18:32.165
Uh, I don't really
think I should mix

18:32.201 --> 18:33.759
politics and propane.

18:33.802 --> 18:35.895
People's passions
run pretty high

18:35.938 --> 18:36.905
about both of those.

18:36.939 --> 18:41.342
Hank, I cannot allow myself
to be beaten by Nancy or Minh!

18:41.376 --> 18:43.867
I could never show my face
in this neighborhood again!

18:43.912 --> 18:46.779
I know, but with your
numbers being zero and all,

18:46.815 --> 18:47.975
maybe you should
just prepare

18:48.016 --> 18:49.449
a concession speech.

18:49.485 --> 18:50.577
What?!

18:50.619 --> 18:52.883
You want me to concede
to those two?!

18:52.921 --> 18:53.979
Hank, you're out!

18:54.022 --> 18:56.081
Peggy, you're in!

18:56.124 --> 19:01.619
I'm no weather bimbo, but
forecast looking cloudy

19:01.663 --> 19:04.530
for you to win!

19:04.566 --> 19:07.194
Just because I'm beautiful
doesn't mean I'm harmless, sug.

19:07.236 --> 19:09.898
Have you ever wondered
what happened

19:09.938 --> 19:11.769
to the weather caster
before me?

19:11.807 --> 19:14.105

Hey, there, friend.

19:32.528 --> 19:36.965

for the voters.

19:36.999 --> 19:39.297
Votin' truck already
done come and took 'em.

19:39.334 --> 19:42.565
But... but I'm the one
who was supposed to have done

19:42.604 --> 19:44.071
come and took 'em.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.573
Hang on there, mister.

19:45.607 --> 19:48.007
I want to talk to you
about that fancy hat

19:48.043 --> 19:49.237
you got on your head there.

19:49.278 --> 19:54.215
Uh, but I don’t want to talk
about my fancy hat.

19:54.249 --> 19:55.648
(screaming)

19:55.684 --> 19:57.174
(grunting)

19:57.219 --> 19:58.743
Son-of-a-bitch!

19:58.787 --> 20:01.415
(Dale whimpering)

20:04.493 --> 20:12.559
(honking)
Hello, election bus here!

20:15.904 --> 20:18.464
Somebody!

20:25.013 --> 20:26.275
Down, Nancy.

20:26.315 --> 20:29.079
Hey, driver, when are we
getting to the polls?

20:29.117 --> 20:32.086
Never.

20:47.803 --> 20:49.065
I cannot
believe we lost

20:49.104 --> 20:50.867
to that Chapman
looney.

20:50.906 --> 20:52.305
Yeah, not only that,

20:52.341 --> 20:53.501
it say there
she's getting rid

20:53.542 --> 20:56.477
of after-school program.

20:56.511 --> 20:59.207
And biology and all
"offensive" encyclopedias,

20:59.247 --> 21:00.680
whatever that means.

21:00.716 --> 21:04.982
I guess we kind of
burnt the toast on this one.

21:05.020 --> 21:05.987
(all sighing)

21:06.021 --> 21:07.488
Hey, she only got 18 votes.

21:07.522 --> 21:10.889
I hijacked twice as many of
your voters on my bus yesterday.

21:10.926 --> 21:12.393
We could have crushed her!

21:12.427 --> 21:14.122
Yeah,
into fine powder.

21:14.162 --> 21:15.629
BOBBY:
Ow, my eye!

21:15.664 --> 21:16.631
JOSEPH:
Cool!

21:16.665 --> 21:18.599
Maybe we should
spend some time

21:18.634 --> 21:20.067
with the kids today.

21:20.102 --> 21:22.297
We could be
their after-school program.

21:22.337 --> 21:24.168
Maybe we take them to...

21:24.206 --> 21:25.173
A museum.

21:25.207 --> 21:26.174
Or the zoo.

21:26.208 --> 21:30.008
Which is a museum
of animals.

22:07.449 --> 22:10.213
PEGGY:
It's for
the freakin'children!
