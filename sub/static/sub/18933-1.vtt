00:56.342 --> 00:59.969
They look pretty strong.
Well done, Dr. Kori.

00:59.979 --> 01:03.272
Do you have enough money? You can
use it like bathwater, I don't mind.

01:03.282 --> 01:05.608
Thank you so much, Baron.

01:05.618 --> 01:07.943
It's not "bathwater,"
it's "hot water".

01:07.953 --> 01:11.286
He may have enough money, but his
brain is still coming up short.

01:13.626 --> 01:16.789
Now I'll be able to get
Satan back good!

01:27.307 --> 01:32.267
"Superwarriors Crushed!
I Will Be the One Who Wins"

01:55.668 --> 02:00.435
The craziness surges toward us.

02:01.273 --> 02:06.006
This is no time for tears.

02:06.946 --> 02:12.475
I will raise my anticipations
a hundred-fold,

02:12.952 --> 02:16.820
and become our party's leading man.

02:18.624 --> 02:24.286
That which you can lose yourself in

02:24.296 --> 02:29.959
will someday make you an incredible guy.

02:29.969 --> 02:32.628
NO... TEN P-KAN

02:32.638 --> 02:35.631
The sky is clear

02:35.641 --> 02:38.300
IPPAI OPPAI

02:38.310 --> 02:40.970
I am feeling fine.

02:40.980 --> 02:43.973
The trouble is here, so enjoy,

02:43.983 --> 02:46.976
you naughty little boy,

02:46.986 --> 02:49.645
We Gotta Power!

02:49.655 --> 02:54.149
Dragonball Z

02:55.327 --> 02:58.320
NO... TEN P-KAN

02:58.330 --> 03:00.923
My head is clear,

03:00.933 --> 03:03.926
RA-MEN ROPPAI

03:03.936 --> 03:06.261
Mother doesn't care.

03:06.271 --> 03:09.598
It's the century's end,
so twist and twirl,

03:09.608 --> 03:12.601
you mischievous little girl,

03:12.611 --> 03:15.270
We Gotta Power!

03:15.367 --> 03:20.367
Dragonball Z

03:40.331 --> 03:44.993
I hope No. 18 isn't doing
anything too rough.

03:45.003 --> 03:49.630
Kuririn-san, once No. 18-san
gets the money from Satan-san,

03:49.640 --> 03:52.000
you're going to treat us to
whatever we want to eat, right?

03:52.010 --> 03:57.778
Yeah. You can eat until your sides split.
You just let me take care of it all.

03:59.350 --> 04:03.611
If you're lying, I'm going to
pull your hair out, Kuririn-san.

04:03.621 --> 04:07.557
D-d-don't be ridiculous! It took some
time to get it to grow out this far!

04:10.628 --> 04:14.155
Papa... Vroom-vroom!

04:40.324 --> 04:41.814
H-hold up!

04:46.330 --> 04:48.093
W-what's this?

04:51.669 --> 04:55.329
Hey, mister, enough of this already.

04:55.339 --> 05:00.339
The 20 million zeni you promised me at the
Tenkaichi Tournament for letting you win...

05:01.679 --> 05:05.877
I'm telling you to hurry
up and pay me in full.

05:06.951 --> 05:11.820
Y-you see, I haven't yet
gotten the prize money...

05:12.623 --> 05:15.183
It looks to me like you want
to get hurt.

05:18.296 --> 05:21.622
I-I'll pay you! If you could
just wait a little while...

05:21.632 --> 05:23.463
Just a minute!

05:24.635 --> 05:26.961
Did you make an appointment
with my secretary?

05:26.971 --> 05:29.197
If you want an autograph,
I'll do that later.

05:29.207 --> 05:31.198
Right now, I'm in the middle
of something.

05:31.976 --> 05:35.605
I brought you a challenge
from my cousin.

05:36.981 --> 05:41.981
A challenge? Give that to my secretary.
I get hundreds of those every day.

05:47.325 --> 05:50.351
For someone who wet the bed
until he was in the 6th grade,

05:50.361 --> 05:52.320
you've got a lot of nerve,
don't you?

05:52.330 --> 05:54.322
Wet the bed!?
Who told you that!?

05:54.332 --> 05:55.656
My cousin.

05:55.666 --> 05:59.327
The only one who knows about that
is... don't tell me it's Jaga!

05:59.337 --> 06:03.931
That's right, Jaga Butta.
You can't say you don't know him.

06:03.941 --> 06:06.934
He knows everything about you.

06:06.944 --> 06:08.836
Yeah, we were friends growing up.

06:08.846 --> 06:11.939
We both devoted ourselves to training
in order to become martial artists.

06:11.949 --> 06:13.941
You were rivals, weren't you?

06:13.951 --> 06:18.946
Yeah. But compared to the ultra-prodigy
that I was, you have to feel bad for Jaga.

06:18.956 --> 06:22.750
Eventually, in the 6th grade,
he was beaten by me,

06:22.760 --> 06:25.286
and he gave up his dreams of
becoming a martial artist.

06:25.296 --> 06:27.696
I always end up having to do this.

06:28.633 --> 06:31.626
I don't have time to fight
Jaga right now.

06:31.636 --> 06:36.630
I'm busy here. Go on.
Off with you, off with you.

06:37.642 --> 06:41.302
Jaga wanted me to tell you something.

06:41.312 --> 06:43.905
If it looks like he's going
to turn you down, he said,

06:43.915 --> 06:46.974
then I will take your world
champion belt,

06:46.984 --> 06:49.310
and on top of that, what happened
when you were in 6th grade will-

06:49.320 --> 06:53.314
Shut up! It was only that one time
when I stayed the night that summer!

06:53.324 --> 06:55.983
One time, two times,
it's all the same.

06:55.993 --> 07:00.254
Hey! I was here first,
you disrespectful lout!

07:00.264 --> 07:03.028
Take care of this after
I'm finished with him.

07:04.268 --> 07:07.929
If you say no, then I'll go to the press
with how, until you were in the 6th grade...

07:07.939 --> 07:10.932
All right! I just have
to fight Jaga, right?

07:10.942 --> 07:14.602
No, you'll fight the Biowarriors
that Jaga has developed.

07:14.612 --> 07:16.443
Biowarriors!?

07:18.282 --> 07:22.610
Hey, Trunks, switch places.
Let me see, too!

07:22.620 --> 07:24.679
D-don't tell me that among them,

07:24.689 --> 07:28.282
there's anyone whose hair turns golden
and stands up on end, is there?

07:28.292 --> 07:29.951
Whoever heard of anyone like that?

07:29.961 --> 07:32.820
Okay then. I'm going to
go beat someone easily,

07:32.830 --> 07:35.289
and then be right back,
so just wait a minute for me.

07:35.299 --> 07:38.292
I'm not falling for that.

07:38.302 --> 07:42.466
You're planning on running away from
me, right? You put on a poor act.

07:43.641 --> 07:45.768
I'm going with you!

07:47.979 --> 07:50.972
And that's what's going on.
You can head on back to Kame House.

07:50.982 --> 07:52.974
I'll come with you.

07:52.984 --> 07:55.643
You have to look after our
girl, here.

07:55.653 --> 07:57.951
But, No. 18...

07:58.990 --> 08:01.916
You're not going to do what
I ask you?

08:01.926 --> 08:04.759
Okay, then. I'll stay home.

08:10.601 --> 08:13.866
Be careful! Come home soon!

08:23.948 --> 08:29.277
Oh, those guys! Damn,
it's nice to be single, huh?

08:29.287 --> 08:32.051
Papa, go potty!

08:34.625 --> 08:38.285
D-don't go yet! Hold on! Hold
on! Hold on! Bathroom! Bathroom!

08:38.296 --> 08:41.059
Aah, and out it comes...

10:13.657 --> 10:16.317
There doesn't seem to be
anyone too great here.

10:16.327 --> 10:21.322
I am the world champion,
the famous Mister Satan!

10:21.332 --> 10:25.993
Nice one! Though the sun
is awfully bright...

10:26.003 --> 10:28.801
It's been a long time, huh Satan?

10:33.677 --> 10:37.135
Welcome to May Queen Castle.

10:39.350 --> 10:41.818
Menmen, nice work.

10:42.353 --> 10:45.015
Baron Jaga Butta!

10:55.366 --> 10:58.359
Y-you're him? You're not at
all the way I remember you.

10:58.369 --> 11:01.529
Apparently, you've succeeded
your pop and become a baron,

11:01.539 --> 11:03.964
but what is the deal with that
pudgy little body of yours?

11:03.974 --> 11:06.300
Training! Do some training!

11:06.310 --> 11:08.642
Who is this young miss, here?

11:10.314 --> 11:12.640
She's my number one pupil.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.845
Number one pupil, am I?

11:25.996 --> 11:29.193
Cut that out, Goten!
It tickles, you know!

11:37.341 --> 11:40.000
G-Goten, I'm no good around
these things!

11:40.010 --> 11:42.410
You're a cutie, aren't you?

11:43.347 --> 11:47.215
There, there, there.
Go off someplace else, okay?

11:48.018 --> 11:50.816
Being raised on Mount Paozu,
I guess he's used to this.

11:52.022 --> 11:56.347
If you hadn't been around, I would
have been the world champion!

11:56.357 --> 11:58.357
That's right.

11:58.367 --> 12:03.367
Jaga has lived his life up to today
with the intent of making you pay.

12:03.377 --> 12:07.377
Are you going to apologize to him?
You're as obsessed as ever.

12:07.638 --> 12:09.463
When you lost to me as a child,

12:09.473 --> 12:12.967
you would follow me all the way into
the bathroom, crying the whole time.

12:12.977 --> 12:16.504
Ha! That's all in the past!
With all of this surplus money I have,

12:16.514 --> 12:19.640
I've employed the finest
biotechnology experts out there,

12:19.650 --> 12:22.243
and had them create these Biowarriors!

12:22.253 --> 12:26.246
You're going to fight these warriors,
who I am so proud of, in my Battle Stage!

12:26.657 --> 12:29.984
This will be a waste of your efforts.

12:29.994 --> 12:32.319
Goten, this is starting
to get exciting, huh?

12:32.329 --> 12:33.329
Mm-hmm.

12:33.339 --> 12:36.657
Trunks-kun, what's a Biowarrior?

12:36.667 --> 12:40.661
It's a warrior that was created
with biotechnology, right?

12:40.671 --> 12:43.330
What's biotechnology?

12:43.340 --> 12:47.835
You don't know anything, huh?
It's genetic engineering.

12:47.845 --> 12:52.006
They can even make new creatures
out of existing cells.

12:52.016 --> 12:55.009
Trunks-kun, you're amazing!

12:55.019 --> 12:57.044
Both Mama and Grandpa are
scientists, after all,

12:57.054 --> 12:59.454
so this sort of thing is
common knowledge to me.

13:04.295 --> 13:07.264
So then, what's genetic engineering?

13:11.635 --> 13:12.960
Well?

13:12.970 --> 13:15.404
Genetic engineering is...

13:18.309 --> 13:22.970
How silly! It's obviously
biotechnology, you know?

13:22.980 --> 13:24.948
Ah, so that's it.

13:26.317 --> 13:28.342
All right!

13:44.001 --> 13:46.834
Ee-yow!

14:05.623 --> 14:08.114
Satan, this is the Battle Stage!

14:09.627 --> 14:12.620
Why aren't there any spectators?

14:12.630 --> 14:14.955
There aren't any TV cameras
here either, are there?

14:14.965 --> 14:19.299
It's rude to treat me, the world
champion, in this way, isn't it?

14:20.971 --> 14:23.297
You big show-off. Menmen?

14:23.307 --> 14:24.965
Yes?

14:24.975 --> 14:27.466
Here's a camera for you.

14:37.655 --> 14:40.981
Awesome! I'd like to fight
in a place like this!

14:40.991 --> 14:44.825
He's rich, after all. Huh?

14:45.663 --> 14:48.530
Trunks-kun, that man...

14:50.334 --> 14:53.064
Behind that Baron
whatever-his-name-is...

14:58.342 --> 15:01.311
It's the prayergiver from when
we were in Natade Village!

15:03.280 --> 15:05.805
What's he doing here?

15:06.617 --> 15:10.917
Well, let's hurry and get
this started. I'm busy.

15:31.975 --> 15:36.742
N-No. 18! How would you
like to go at them for a bit?

15:37.648 --> 15:41.975
If you'll add on another
20 million zeni.

15:41.985 --> 15:43.977
R-right.

15:43.987 --> 15:48.987
Okay, who's first? My number one
pupil, No. 18, will face you.

15:50.661 --> 15:53.661
Not so fast!
I will decide the match-ups!

16:04.942 --> 16:08.235
I want to go back with Satan, quickly!

16:08.245 --> 16:11.939
Let's not make things too difficult,
and settle this in a Battle Royale!

16:11.949 --> 16:15.680
I'll defeat the whole lot
of you in place of Satan!

16:17.955 --> 16:21.949
No way! That goes against
the spirit of fair spray!

16:21.959 --> 16:24.952
You dummy. What you meant
to say was "fair play".

16:24.962 --> 16:26.691
We're going to join in, too!

16:36.306 --> 16:37.631
Is that?

16:37.641 --> 16:38.835
What is this?

16:39.977 --> 16:44.304
Old man Onjichama-onbachama,
long time no see.

16:44.314 --> 16:45.639
You know them?

16:45.649 --> 16:47.480
Y-yes.

16:48.318 --> 16:52.646
Fellas, this is not the Junior
Round of the Tenkaichi Tournament.

16:52.656 --> 16:54.982
You have to be 18 years old
to enter here.

16:54.992 --> 16:59.653
Right, right. These Biowarriors
are too strong for you.

16:59.663 --> 17:04.156
I wish you would give us some credit.
We can do this sort of thing.

17:15.279 --> 17:18.105
These kids are your
pupils too, aren't they?

17:18.115 --> 17:22.608
They're using cheap tricks!
You can't fool my eyes!

17:22.618 --> 17:27.281
All right, fine! Biowarriors, turn this
place into a villagefest with those guys!

17:27.290 --> 17:29.283
Villagefest?

17:29.293 --> 17:31.618
What you meant to say is "bloodfest".

17:31.628 --> 17:33.220
They're both festivals!

17:41.972 --> 17:44.298
Yow-ow-ow! That's fighting dirty!

17:44.308 --> 17:46.967
What sort of folks are these?

17:46.977 --> 17:49.946
This is bad! I wonder if
they realize...

18:02.259 --> 18:07.259
Jaga, how do you like my pupils' strength?
I didn't even have to join in.

18:09.600 --> 18:12.593
This is getting worse and worse.
Now, while I still have a chance...

18:12.603 --> 18:17.598
Prayergiver, where are you going?
Things are just about to get interesting.

18:17.608 --> 18:19.266
J-just heading to the bathroom.

18:19.276 --> 18:20.267
Hold it in.

18:20.277 --> 18:21.602
O-okay.

18:21.612 --> 18:26.612
All right! Now comes the real thing!
Satan, I still have a trump card to play!

18:26.617 --> 18:29.943
Don't be too stunned when you see him!
If you're going to apologize, now's the time!

18:29.953 --> 18:33.614
Jaga, you sound like a beaten dog,
whining from a distance.

18:33.624 --> 18:35.949
No worries. Bring out anyone you want.

18:35.959 --> 18:41.622
No matter who you bring out, they
won't be any match for us. Right, guys?

18:41.632 --> 18:46.632
Ooh, geez, you're so smug!
Damn it, f-fine! I'll show you!

19:25.609 --> 19:28.601
Satan-chan, it's the end
of the line for you!

19:36.286 --> 19:39.187
Awesome!

19:41.291 --> 19:44.284
Say, miss, how do you make Biowarriors?

19:44.294 --> 19:47.287
That might be a little too hard
for you boys to understand.

19:47.297 --> 19:51.625
I know that biotechnology
is genetic engineering!

19:51.635 --> 19:54.294
Oh my, that's amazing!

19:54.304 --> 19:56.964
My mama is good when
it comes to mechanics.

19:56.974 --> 19:58.632
T-Trunks-kun...

19:58.642 --> 19:59.633
What is it?

19:59.643 --> 20:02.578
T-that one has a tail!

20:03.313 --> 20:05.213
Like a Saiyan, huh?

20:28.005 --> 20:29.905
B-Broli!

20:38.348 --> 20:42.009
B-but we completely wiped him out
that time with a Kamehame-Ha...

20:42.019 --> 20:43.316
Uh-huh...

21:00.637 --> 21:04.965
He's supposed to be dead!
That's not fair, huh?

21:04.975 --> 21:06.533
Uh-uh...

21:08.311 --> 21:12.973
Jaga, whoever you send out, the result will
be the same. You're just wasting your money.

21:12.983 --> 21:17.579
Shut up! Okay, Doctor,
send out the superwarrior!

21:18.989 --> 21:21.314
Nain, remove the culture
fluid, would you?

21:21.324 --> 21:22.848
Yes, Dr. Kori.

21:32.669 --> 21:34.661
T-Trunks-kun...

21:34.671 --> 21:37.868
I-I think I'm going to wet
myself again...

21:38.675 --> 21:42.669
This time, I will clobber him.
No. 18, stay out of this.

21:42.679 --> 21:45.614
Hmph! Suit yourself.

21:47.350 --> 21:49.375
Who's it going to be!?

21:50.020 --> 21:53.680
Hey, Mister! You're the one
who brought Broli here, huh?

21:53.690 --> 21:58.690
Thanks to you, I lost all face as
the prayergiver of Natade Village.

22:00.297 --> 22:04.624
Nobody asks me to do any
work for them any more!

22:04.634 --> 22:06.626
Did Broli survive?

22:06.636 --> 22:10.964
Broli died. He was beaten so badly
by you, there wasn't any trace left.

22:10.974 --> 22:13.400
What is in there is a Broli
that has been regenerated

22:13.410 --> 22:15.105
through bio-power from his genes!

22:29.993 --> 22:35.455
I took some of the dried blood
that was inside the space pod,

22:35.465 --> 22:37.763
and sold it to the baron.

22:45.675 --> 22:50.170
From there, the superb
bioscientists employed by the baron

22:50.180 --> 22:52.672
took that single drop of Broli's blood,

22:52.682 --> 22:57.984
and did a magnificent job of bringing
the mightiest of warriors back to life.

23:02.959 --> 23:04.151
That can't be!

23:04.161 --> 23:08.825
Mister, if Broli comes back to life,
do you know what's going to happen?

23:10.300 --> 23:12.734
Which is why I'm leaving
the rest up to you guys!

23:13.637 --> 23:15.901
What should we do, Trunks-kun?

23:24.648 --> 23:28.642
Hei! Can you tell how
incredible he is, too?

23:28.652 --> 23:33.652
Relax. The superwarrior has been made to
respond to all orders given in my voice.

23:34.724 --> 23:36.624
He's on our side.

23:36.660 --> 23:39.052
Goten, if it's going to come to that,

23:39.062 --> 23:40.987
let's blow away the capsule that
Broli is in before he comes out!

23:40.997 --> 23:42.487
Mm-hmm!

23:48.672 --> 23:50.330
Ka...

23:50.340 --> 23:52.171
me...

23:59.683 --> 24:01.274
What about a kame ("turtle")?

24:01.284 --> 24:03.610
I-I'll bet it's another trick!

24:03.620 --> 24:06.180
Those kids! What do they
think they're doing!?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.283
Ha...

24:10.293 --> 24:12.625
me...

24:50.333 --> 24:52.993
Nain, the culture fluid is
spilling out!

24:53.003 --> 24:55.996
Shift the protective
walls around number 13!

24:56.006 --> 24:57.006
Right!

25:38.315 --> 25:39.639
He's out!

25:39.649 --> 25:41.116
What do we do?

25:43.653 --> 25:46.884
Hei! Stop! He's on our side!

25:58.001 --> 25:59.332
Hei!

26:02.605 --> 26:05.265
W-w-what kind of fluid is that!?

26:05.275 --> 26:07.600
Nain! Dispose of that culture
fluid at once!

26:07.610 --> 26:09.402
When the culture fluid comes
in contact with the air,

26:09.412 --> 26:11.938
it devours the cells of any
genetically differing life form,

26:11.948 --> 26:15.608
and multiplies itself over and over,
until it is beyond our control!

26:15.618 --> 26:16.448
Right!

26:20.957 --> 26:25.618
Now, superwarrior,
show me your power!

26:25.628 --> 26:27.619
Defeat Satan!

26:30.633 --> 26:34.592
No. 18! You go first after all!

26:36.639 --> 26:39.165
All right. This will add on
another 20 million zeni.

26:39.175 --> 26:42.635
Once I defeat him, we're heading back
immediately, got it? Then you'll pay up!

26:42.645 --> 26:47.640
F-fine! If we get home safely,
I'll pay you as much as you want!

26:47.650 --> 26:49.976
Don't forget those words!

26:49.986 --> 26:51.647
No. 18-san!

27:14.277 --> 27:15.802
I can't believe this thing exists.

27:15.812 --> 27:19.612
It's one unbelievable monster!
20 million zeni is too inexpensive!

27:27.624 --> 27:29.949
Way to go! How do you like that?
Looks pretty painful, Satan!

27:29.959 --> 27:33.953
This is the real thing! You can apologize
now, but I still won't let you off!

27:33.963 --> 27:39.196
Now, for all the years' worth of bitterness
I've harbored, pound Satan to a pulp!

27:41.971 --> 27:44.405
I-I'll be killed!

27:45.642 --> 27:49.908
T-time out a second!
My stomach is starting to hurt!

28:06.596 --> 28:08.596
Save us!

28:15.271 --> 28:19.599
Pops, what are you so afraid of!?
You're the world champion, right?

28:19.609 --> 28:21.601
You've got to fight back!

28:21.611 --> 28:24.938
R-right. But my stomach hurts...

28:24.948 --> 28:26.643
Trunks-kun!

28:28.284 --> 28:30.944
Goten, we're not going
to be beaten this time!

28:30.954 --> 28:31.978
Uh-uh!

28:37.627 --> 28:40.323
Oh! Golden warriors!

28:42.966 --> 28:45.196
Now things are going to be fine!

28:45.969 --> 28:47.961
We're not about to be beaten up twice!

28:47.971 --> 28:49.962
We won't fall for the same trick again!

29:23.940 --> 29:29.936
Stop! If any more of that culture fluid
is spilled... if that were to happen!

29:29.946 --> 29:34.941
Hey, Broli! I can see through
all of your slow moves!

29:34.951 --> 29:38.944
How long did you think those same
energy blasts were going to work?

29:46.629 --> 29:49.598
Stop! That's enough! Stop!

29:55.305 --> 29:59.299
We can take him, Goten! I can
see how he's going to move next!

29:59.309 --> 30:01.209
I can see, too!

30:02.979 --> 30:04.503
Save us!

30:12.322 --> 30:13.980
We're falling! It's no use!

30:13.990 --> 30:14.981
Let us out of here, quick!

30:14.991 --> 30:16.649
The culture fluid is coming!

30:16.659 --> 30:19.321
All right, this is all of it.

30:28.004 --> 30:29.329
What's this!?

30:29.339 --> 30:32.467
Onbachama jichama! Yayakoni totsama!

30:40.683 --> 30:42.082
W-what is it?

30:43.353 --> 30:44.677
Push the emergency button!

30:44.687 --> 30:46.012
What's going on!?

30:46.022 --> 30:47.347
Open the door!

30:47.357 --> 30:50.326
Open up! Open up! Open up!

30:53.363 --> 30:54.352
We're saved!

31:02.639 --> 31:04.631
Goten! Hit him from your side!

31:04.641 --> 31:06.641
What!?
Save us!

31:15.318 --> 31:18.913
If I stay here, no matter how many
lives I have, it won't be enough!

31:34.003 --> 31:35.402
You bastard!

31:55.692 --> 31:58.718
Are you okay?
I was worried about you.

31:58.728 --> 32:02.596
A husband ought to at least
rescue his own wife, right?

32:22.985 --> 32:24.509
Kuririn-san!

32:41.003 --> 32:42.328
Goten, now!

32:42.338 --> 32:43.327
All right!

32:47.677 --> 32:49.335
Goten, we've got him!

32:49.345 --> 32:50.345
Uh-huh!

32:54.684 --> 32:57.343
Help me!

32:57.353 --> 32:58.353
Goten!

33:12.301 --> 33:16.294
Goten! What are you doing!?
I can't do this alone!

33:18.975 --> 33:20.975
My shoulder!

33:38.661 --> 33:42.321
Stop! That's far enough!
He's going to die!

33:42.331 --> 33:47.064
I'm the one who brought you back
to life! Listen to what I say!

33:56.679 --> 33:58.909
You'll pay for that!

34:10.960 --> 34:12.621
M-my shoulder!

34:19.635 --> 34:21.466
Rats!

34:23.306 --> 34:26.275
If only my shoulder wasn't hurt!

34:34.984 --> 34:36.645
Kienzan!

34:57.673 --> 34:59.538
G-Goten!

35:02.945 --> 35:04.604
What should I do?

35:04.614 --> 35:06.939
Help us!

35:06.949 --> 35:09.509
Help us! Help us!

35:29.639 --> 35:31.368
T-that's it!

35:32.642 --> 35:33.973
That's got to be it!

35:42.985 --> 35:44.247
Broli!

35:44.654 --> 35:48.055
Hey! I'll give you a spanky-spanky!

35:49.659 --> 35:54.653
What's the matter, Broli?
Get over here, now, and I'll kill you!

35:56.332 --> 35:59.324
If you don't like it, come over
here and do something about it!

36:00.937 --> 36:01.937
Now!

36:03.272 --> 36:05.399
Take this, Broli!

37:14.610 --> 37:16.441
I-I did it!

37:59.321 --> 38:00.447
Goten!

38:07.930 --> 38:10.125
Goten! Goten!

38:31.954 --> 38:33.819
We made it!

38:38.627 --> 38:39.952
Where's Broli?

38:39.962 --> 38:41.657
He's in that fluid.

38:43.966 --> 38:46.730
Instead of power,
I used up here, up here!

38:59.648 --> 39:02.908
I'm ruined! I've lost everything!

39:02.918 --> 39:07.753
You idiot! You're going to lose your
life before you've lost everything else!

39:11.594 --> 39:13.926
Goten, we've got to save everyone!

39:20.936 --> 39:24.263
Hold on tight! If you fall,
you'll be out for good!

39:24.273 --> 39:25.273
Right!

39:25.941 --> 39:27.933
Hurry up and go!

39:27.943 --> 39:30.104
D-don't push, No. 18!

39:34.283 --> 39:36.942
You old guys, hang onto me.

39:36.952 --> 39:39.945
You'd save me, even after
setting all of this up?

39:39.955 --> 39:44.415
Jaga, you've got to follow
his spirit of hair spray!

40:03.646 --> 40:06.305
It's no use.
It has no effect whatsoever.

40:06.315 --> 40:09.308
Isn't there anything we
can do about that fluid!?

40:09.318 --> 40:11.710
That culture fluid's replicative
power becomes stronger

40:11.720 --> 40:14.647
when it devours the cells
of a differing life form.

40:14.657 --> 40:17.116
Since it has taken in the
cells of that Broli monster,

40:17.126 --> 40:18.984
it has obtained extraordinary power!

40:18.994 --> 40:24.323
At this rate, it will cover the entire
earth! It's the end of the world!

40:24.333 --> 40:26.325
I've done something terrible!

40:26.335 --> 40:27.660
Take a good look at yourself!

40:27.670 --> 40:30.329
Hey, you're in on this too, Mister!

40:30.347 --> 40:33.267
You're right.
Help me!

40:55.698 --> 40:59.259
Get away! I'm the world
champion, Mister Satan!

41:06.642 --> 41:12.376
I get it. The fluid is vulnerable to
the seawater. We can stop the fluid!

41:18.320 --> 41:19.979
Hurry!

41:19.989 --> 41:21.013
Let's go!

41:39.341 --> 41:42.469
Ka...

41:43.345 --> 41:45.643
me...

41:46.348 --> 41:48.407
ha...

41:49.351 --> 41:51.376
me...

41:51.687 --> 41:53.951
HA!

42:51.680 --> 42:53.672
Goten, we did it!

42:53.682 --> 42:54.682
Uh-huh!

42:55.684 --> 42:58.677
Goten, way to figure that out!

42:58.687 --> 43:00.612
It was all thanks to Satan-san.

43:00.622 --> 43:04.490
Even he comes in handy
once in a while, huh?

43:06.295 --> 43:10.061
Kakarrot!

43:14.303 --> 43:16.237
What's with this guy!?

43:17.973 --> 43:18.964
We've had it now!

43:18.974 --> 43:20.601
We're done for!

43:26.648 --> 43:28.843
Look!

43:35.991 --> 43:38.984
You bastard! Startle us, will you?

43:38.994 --> 43:41.189
That is one tenacious bastard.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.663
Now, Broli is finished for good!

43:51.673 --> 43:52.537
Uh-huh.

44:00.282 --> 44:02.941
Hey! Someone pick me up!

44:02.951 --> 44:05.844
All right. My pick-up
fare is 40 million zeni,

44:05.854 --> 44:08.186
which altogether comes
to 100 million zeni!

44:09.625 --> 44:11.718
You're kidding!

44:12.628 --> 44:14.653
That's one stubborn guy!

44:29.311 --> 44:33.038
What? Kaio-sama said for me to
go to Hell again with Paikuhan,

44:33.048 --> 44:36.415
and put down Broli,
who is running amuck?

44:41.990 --> 44:44.925
There's just no helping that
Broli, huh?

44:47.663 --> 44:50.923
All right, but before I do, I guess
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

44:50.933 --> 44:53.231
Let me eat first, okay?

44:59.569 --> 45:02.402
D! R! A! G! O! N! Dragon Power!

45:02.839 --> 45:06.165
D! R! A! G! O! N! Dragon Power!

45:06.175 --> 45:09.502
Power! Power! Power!

45:09.512 --> 45:14.512
Dragon Power!

45:23.860 --> 45:28.860
From faraway in the darkness,
they come...

45:30.199 --> 45:35.199
Biowarriors, with their
genetics rearranged.

45:35.872 --> 45:40.872
Against a guy that cannot
be defeated alone,

45:42.211 --> 45:47.211
if our two hearts meld into one,

45:47.884 --> 45:52.378
Victory will smile on us!

45:53.890 --> 45:55.548
D! Doesn't matter how long,

45:55.558 --> 45:57.216
R! Remain moving forward,

45:57.226 --> 46:00.486
A! Affirming endless love!

46:00.496 --> 46:03.823
GO! Fight! Go! Go! Go!

46:03.833 --> 46:06.492
N! No need to hold back!

46:06.502 --> 46:11.502
The future for the two of us
is unlimited!

46:13.509 --> 46:16.171
D! R! A! G! O! N! Dragon Power!

46:16.512 --> 46:19.839
D! R! A! G! O! N! Dragon Power!

46:19.849 --> 46:22.875
Power! Power! Power!

46:23.519 --> 46:28.519
Dragon Power!
