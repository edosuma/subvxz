WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:08.433
You know,
something really stinks in here.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.515
We are watching Fox.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.751
Al, did you take out the trash?

00:14.960 --> 00:18.111
I'll take it out
when there's enough for a whole load.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.229
Okay.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.557
I know you people are used to living
in a cesspool.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.957
So you're probably not even bothered
by this garbage strike.

00:31.200 --> 00:35.034
Wait a minute.
How can trash go on strike?

00:37.040 --> 00:39.793
Hang up your fishnets
and stay in all night.

00:42.240 --> 00:44.913
But on behalf
of the entire neighbourhood...

00:45.120 --> 00:46.792
...I demand that you do something...

00:47.000 --> 00:49.673
...to improve the look of things
around here.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:03.360 --> 01:05.351
Now, I've done my part.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.679
Marcie is absolutely right.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.189
We have to get together
to get rid of this garbage.

01:10.400 --> 01:11.958
Now, I'll hand you the bags.

01:12.160 --> 01:13.957
You throw them over
in the D'Arcys' yard.

01:54.040 --> 01:56.679
Go, go, go.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.316
Oh, man, these guys don't hustle.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.829
Lazy bums.

02:04.360 --> 02:06.430
Bums is right.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.395
Al, can you hand me that beer?

02:18.080 --> 02:19.991
Can't reach.

02:22.040 --> 02:24.031
Atten-hut!

02:28.360 --> 02:29.759
As you were.

02:29.960 --> 02:33.350
You are looking at 2nd Lieutenant
D'Arcy, National Guard Reserves.

02:33.560 --> 02:36.154
More like Gl-joke.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.549
Hey, this action figure
is anatomically correct.

02:42.400 --> 02:46.473
After living with Marcie all these years,
I doubt it.

02:48.360 --> 02:49.475
What's the scam?

02:49.720 --> 02:51.756
No scam.
I'll just say goodbye to Marcie.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.389
- There's the scam.
- There's the scam.

02:54.640 --> 02:55.755
Hey, it's a great deal.

02:55.960 --> 02:58.633
One weekend out of every month,
you get three hots in a cot.

02:58.840 --> 03:01.638
You get to party with a bunch of guys
and you get paid.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.075
Sounds like my ex-wife's job.

03:04.280 --> 03:07.829
Uncle Sam will pay me to leave Peg
and the kids for the weekend?

03:08.080 --> 03:10.196
You have to go through
basic training first.

03:10.400 --> 03:12.470
But you don't have to go
to your regular job...

03:12.680 --> 03:14.477
...and your boss still has to pay you.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.269
I am suddenly feeling the need
to serve my country.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.192
Oh, wait a minute.
Aren't we too old to join the reserve?

03:22.440 --> 03:25.113
Well, you're pretty much too old
for everything.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.956
But with my connections,
I can get you in.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.596
That's the fighting spirit
we're looking for.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.193
We'll be the few, the proud-

03:35.400 --> 03:38.153
We'll be the best that we can be.

03:39.520 --> 03:42.478
<i>No, guys,
the National Guard's motto is:</i>

03:42.680 --> 03:45.035
" If it happens on a weekend...

03:45.920 --> 03:47.638
...we'll be there. "

03:51.760 --> 03:54.354
I'm open. I'm open.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.115
Eight touchdowns.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.951
Hey, hey, let's do top bunks
versus bottom bunks now.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.111
Al, I think it may be time
to hit the hay.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.679
What? Are you old?

04:08.880 --> 04:10.632
Yeah.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.918
Me too.

04:13.640 --> 04:16.757
Oh, man, this pillow is lumpy.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.197
At least it doesn't have red hair
and begs for sex.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.754
Man, this is the life.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.588
Rise and shine, ladies.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.109
Hope you had a good night sleep...

04:36.320 --> 04:39.790
...because your nightmare
begins now.

04:40.000 --> 04:43.834
- Do you hear me?
- Sir, yes, sir.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.076
Am I disturbing you, private?

04:48.280 --> 04:49.633
Al Bundy.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.353
Al Bundy, sir.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.479
Well, no one's called me sir
in a long, long time.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.912
How about moron?
They've called you that, haven't they?

04:58.160 --> 05:00.594
Sir, yes, sir.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.555
Ladies' shoe salesman.

05:02.760 --> 05:04.830
Well, you're in the reserve now.

05:05.040 --> 05:08.635
- You're not in some candy-ass mall.
- You haven't seen my customers.

05:08.840 --> 05:11.195
Every day it's the battle of the bulge,
right, Griff?

05:11.440 --> 05:13.510
Who's Griff?
Somebody here called Griff?

05:14.360 --> 05:17.955
Drop and give me 50, mall scum.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.998
All I got here is this five.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.072
Pushups, you idiot.

05:24.360 --> 05:27.636
And your little buddies here too.

05:31.480 --> 05:36.474
Okay. Top 10 reasons we're glad
your father has gone to boot camp.

05:36.720 --> 05:39.837
Number 10, your father is gone.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.272
Number nine,
he took his socks with him.

05:46.760 --> 05:50.355
Number eight,
we don't have to hide the food.

05:50.560 --> 05:51.549
Good.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.550
Number seven, the drains flow free.

05:59.840 --> 06:03.196
I think you know why I'm here.

06:04.360 --> 06:07.397
All the flies in the neighbourhood
have named you queen?

06:10.040 --> 06:12.838
Peggy,
this is just some of the garbage...

06:13.040 --> 06:15.759
...your obnoxious children
have dumped in my yard.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.515
How dare you accuse
my obnoxious children?

06:19.720 --> 06:22.598
There's no way that you can prove
that that's our garbage.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.633
Colour Me Cheetahs by Clairol.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.317
<i>Go, Dog, Gol</i>

06:33.800 --> 06:37.759
I can't believe you threw this out.
I haven't even finished it yet, Bud.

06:39.680 --> 06:43.559
Bunch of dogs, big party,
nothing happens, the end.

06:44.080 --> 06:45.991
Sounds like one of your dates.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.919
Okay. You have two choices.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.192
I can either bury you headfirst
in my compost heap...

06:53.400 --> 06:56.073
...or you come with me
and pick up every piece of garbage...

06:56.280 --> 06:57.872
...that you have dumped in my yard.

06:58.120 --> 07:01.157
You mean since the garbage strike,
or since you've moved in?

07:03.640 --> 07:06.200
<i>You're not worthy of the Guard.</i>

07:06.400 --> 07:08.550
<i>We're not worthy of the Guard.</i>

07:08.800 --> 07:11.360
<i>You're out of shape
with butts of lard.</i>

07:11.600 --> 07:13.875
<i>We're out of shape
with butts of lard.</i>

07:14.080 --> 07:16.389
<i>Oink off, three, four.</i>

07:16.640 --> 07:20.076
<i>- Oink off.
- We're sore.</i>

07:22.840 --> 07:25.434
I swear, you two are slower than snails
in molasses.

07:25.680 --> 07:29.593
<i>That's a good one. Coming from a guy
whose girlfriend starred in Babe.</i>

07:32.280 --> 07:34.191
I wish.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.189
Oh, Griff.

07:40.440 --> 07:42.158
I can't take it anymore.

07:42.360 --> 07:43.349
I quit.

07:43.560 --> 07:47.109
Al, you can't quit.
If you quit, you've got to go home.

07:52.640 --> 07:55.074
Hey, wait a minute.

08:10.440 --> 08:11.668
I can't climb this wall.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.998
Sure you can, buddy. Don't quit.
Let me show you how it's done.

08:18.440 --> 08:20.908
I can't.

08:23.000 --> 08:24.353
It can't be done.

08:30.880 --> 08:32.756
Nobody can possibly use skills
like that-

08:32.960 --> 08:35.349
Running through tyres,
waving your arms up in the air?

08:35.559 --> 08:37.515
It's like screaming,
"Shoot me. Shoot me. "

08:37.760 --> 08:39.990
Don't tempt me, shoe boy.

08:40.200 --> 08:42.111
Sir, good afternoon, sir.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.993
And may I add your medals
are particularly shiny today, sir.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.509
Why are you sucking up to this guy?

08:50.800 --> 08:53.109
Oh, I get it.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.153
So, high heel...

08:55.360 --> 08:57.954
...are you going to finish this course
or not?

08:58.200 --> 09:00.316
Can't, sir. Tired, sir.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.949
Then let me help you rest.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.794
Well, good news, ladies.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.838
You're getting that well-deserved
psychiatric leave, sir?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.310
No, I've used them all up.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.997
The news is basic training
is cut short.

09:20.240 --> 09:22.356
Thank God. I'll pack.

09:22.600 --> 09:23.669
I'll warm up the car.

09:23.920 --> 09:26.036
Not so fast, maggots.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.310
This unit's been activated.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.511
We're going on a mission.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.439
Permission to know where, sir.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.910
Denied. Now go home...

09:35.120 --> 09:36.758
...make love to your widows...

09:36.960 --> 09:41.556
...and report back here
at 1600 hours.

09:43.720 --> 09:44.914
Al, I'm scared.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.235
You're scared?

09:46.440 --> 09:48.749
I gotta go home
and make love to Peg.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.395
We're in business, Kel.

09:54.600 --> 09:57.478
I got the fan belt off
of Mrs. D'Arcy's Mercedes.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.592
It serves her right for making us
take our garbage back.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.189
Okay.
I left the D'Arcys' attic window open.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.595
- Are you sure this thing is aimed right?
- Yeah.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.916
Now, I've calculated the exact
trajectory...

10:08.120 --> 10:11.476
...taking into account mass, angle,
velocity and wind speed.

10:11.720 --> 10:14.792
And, of course,
your complete lack of sex appeal.

10:15.800 --> 10:19.349
- What does that have to do to with it?
- Well, I had so many variables.

10:19.560 --> 10:21.835
I needed one constant.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.155
It's amazing how you can figure out
a difficult mathematical equation...

10:27.360 --> 10:30.397
...but yet you can't find your way out
of a frat house.

10:31.640 --> 10:33.596
I can too.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.074
I just yell, " I'm pregnant. "

10:35.280 --> 10:37.874
And the next thing you know,
I'm out in the alley.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.399
Okay. Let's let her rip.

10:40.600 --> 10:41.953
Okay.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.036
And here we go.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.191
Pull.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.272
Yeah.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.397
What are you kids up to?

10:53.600 --> 10:55.397
Recycling.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.118
Well, family,
I'm off to fight the forces of evil.

10:59.320 --> 11:00.833
That's nice, dear.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.473
Will someone pay attention here?

11:02.680 --> 11:06.753
They're having me go out to fight
horrible people, probably the French.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.509
You may never see me again.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.870
Dad, maybe I should join the Army.

11:12.080 --> 11:14.071
I hear women
are attracted to men in uniform.

11:14.320 --> 11:15.469
It's not the uniform, son.

11:15.680 --> 11:19.389
It's knowing that he's been trained
to obey orders and eat crap.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.239
Oh, no, Daddy is going away again?

11:23.480 --> 11:26.677
Now,
this time he's joined the Post Office.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.069
Don't worry, pumpkin...

11:29.280 --> 11:32.875
...Daddy is not going to any place
as dangerous as that.

11:33.120 --> 11:36.874
Kel, I thought you of all people would
recognise a man in a military uniform.

11:37.360 --> 11:41.148
This is what they look like on?
Oh, my God. They're so cute.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.834
Honey, you shouldn't say things
like that to Daddy...

11:44.040 --> 11:46.759
...after he's just been trained
to use a gun.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.913
Peg.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.117
Don't you want to kiss me goodbye?

11:51.320 --> 11:54.153
Tonight,
I may be standing in harm's way.

11:54.400 --> 11:59.110
Al, I don't care where you're standing
as long as it isn't in front of Ricki Lake.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.549
Bud...

12:01.760 --> 12:04.877
...until I come back, you're going to be
the man of the family.

12:05.080 --> 12:06.308
Make me proud, son.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.835
I will, Dad, and don't worry.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.873
<i>I'll keep all your Big 'Uns safe
and sound until you get back.</i>

12:12.120 --> 12:13.269
That's not necessary, son.

12:13.480 --> 12:16.552
What the hell do you think
I got in this bag?

12:17.800 --> 12:20.030
Daddy, be very careful.

12:20.280 --> 12:21.918
Oh, Kel, what are you worried about?

12:22.120 --> 12:25.829
The National Guard is nothing but a
bunch of Boy Scouts with beer bellies.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.709
You take it all for granted, don't you,
you little pinkos?

12:30.080 --> 12:31.513
Well, keep this in mind.

12:31.720 --> 12:33.756
The National Guard
is the thin green line...

12:33.960 --> 12:36.269
...that separates you
from total anarchy.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.029
And I'm damn proud to do anything
my country asks of me.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.992
I'm not doing it.
You can't make me pick up garbage.

12:45.600 --> 12:49.559
You do what I tell you to do
and any more lip out of you and I'll-

12:50.440 --> 12:51.919
Tell.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.794
I wouldn't have done this
if it wasn't for you guys.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.958
"Join the Reserve. See the state. "

12:59.200 --> 13:00.155
Excuse me.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.396
Is this mission interfering
with your whining?

13:03.240 --> 13:06.277
Now, these strikers are angry.
Watch your backs.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.710
Oh, like I'm afraid of them
garbage men.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.559
What are they gonna do?
Make noise early in the morning?

13:18.680 --> 13:21.319
Run away. Run away.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.636
Told you so.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.468
And hit.

13:31.360 --> 13:33.078
That was a good one, Kel.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.953
You know, I kind of wish
Daddy was here to enjoy this.

13:36.200 --> 13:37.474
Oh, I know.

13:37.680 --> 13:40.877
I can't believe
he hasn't even written since he left.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.193
Mom, he's only been gone
for four hours.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.559
Well, in that case,
I guess I better get on with my life.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.110
Maybe you should
throw over your father's clothes.

13:52.320 --> 13:55.118
I could really use the closet space.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.508
Look. I'm gonna have to adjust
this tension. Okay?

13:58.720 --> 13:59.994
- Okay.
- Now-

14:00.200 --> 14:02.555
Whatever you do,
don't touch that lever.

14:02.800 --> 14:03.835
What, this one?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.033
Cool.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.640
Way to navigate, Jefferson.

14:20.240 --> 14:24.153
I am your commanding officer.
I should be addressed as sir.

14:24.400 --> 14:28.029
But if I called you sir,
what would I call your wife?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.873
And for your information,
we're not lost.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.868
Now, according to this map, we can't
be more than a finger away from base.

14:37.080 --> 14:39.469
Which finger? This one?

14:39.760 --> 14:41.955
Oh, very nice.

14:42.280 --> 14:47.149
You owe the good people of Waukegan
an apology for that little gesture.

14:47.400 --> 14:51.598
Lieutenant D'Arcy, I want to say this
in the most respectful way possible.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.712
Get us home
or we're gonna frag your ass.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.639
<i>Come in, Ziploc team.</i>

14:58.840 --> 15:01.479
<i>Are you out there? Over.</i>

15:02.440 --> 15:03.475
We read you, over.

15:03.680 --> 15:06.672
<i>Listen up, men. The Hefty team
is taking a big dumpster.</i>

15:06.880 --> 15:11.032
<i>We need backup at 23rd and Addison.
Copy?</i>

15:11.280 --> 15:13.794
Roger. On our way. Over. Okay.

15:14.640 --> 15:17.234
Okay.
We have to go through the auto yard.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.237
- Griff, you should go first.
- Good idea.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.590
I don't think so.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.319
Let me rephrase.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.431
I'm ordering you to go first.

15:25.680 --> 15:28.877
Then let me rephrase. Bite me.

15:30.440 --> 15:31.998
Haven't you ever seen a war movie?

15:32.200 --> 15:35.397
The black man always gets it first.

15:37.440 --> 15:38.589
What do you mean?

15:38.800 --> 15:40.552
<i>Jim Brown in The Dirty Dozen.</i>

15:40.760 --> 15:42.751
<i>Laurence Fishburne
in Apocalypse Now.</i>

15:42.960 --> 15:45.474
<i>Bubba in Forrest Gump.</i>

15:46.480 --> 15:49.199
<i>Any black man in Star Trek.</i>

15:49.400 --> 15:51.595
We go in, test the waters,
get killed...

15:51.800 --> 15:54.598
...and you white guys
go home to your families.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.631
See, we both lose.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.669
Will you two pipe down.
The strikers will hear us.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.313
Now, come on. Let's move out.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.117
Come on, Griff.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.117
Look out.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.518
- Man down.
- Cover us. Cover us.

16:21.720 --> 16:23.312
Gotcha.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.595
Oh, Griff.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.588
Griff, why? Oh, why? Oh, why?

16:32.480 --> 16:35.233
That shell was meant for me.

16:35.440 --> 16:36.668
Oh, listen, Al.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.519
- Would you do something for me?
- Anything, buddy.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.275
If I don't make it, would you look up
my ex-wife and-

16:43.480 --> 16:44.993
And tell her that you love her?

16:45.200 --> 16:48.749
No, tell her that she's a bitch.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.360
You'll be able to tell her that in person,
buddy.

16:55.920 --> 17:00.232
Oh, my God, a grenade. Take cover.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.597
It's an avocado, Jefferson.

17:05.160 --> 17:08.755
Why don't you throw yourself on it
and we'll have guacamole.

17:09.720 --> 17:13.713
I can't take the pressure.
I want my Marcie.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.508
Come in. Anyone.

17:18.720 --> 17:19.675
Help.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.916
<i>I can't help you, Ziploc. I'm alone.</i>

17:23.119 --> 17:26.112
<i>I'm pinned under a dumpster
on the other side of the wall.</i>

17:26.319 --> 17:27.513
What should we do?

17:27.720 --> 17:30.951
<i>Pull out. Save your candy-asses.</i>

17:32.120 --> 17:33.394
You heard him. Let's go home.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.753
I got some yolk in my ear,
but I think I can drive.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.153
I'm going in after them.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.515
Are you crazy?

17:44.760 --> 17:45.875
Maybe so.

17:46.080 --> 17:50.551
But I'm going to show that sergeant
that High Heel Bundy is no candy-ass.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.113
I'm coming, sarge.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.515
Forget it, High Heel,
you'll never make it.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.392
The hell I won't.

18:25.040 --> 18:27.031
- Sorry, sarge.
- You're a fool.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.117
You'll never move this dumpster.

18:29.320 --> 18:30.389
Oh, yeah?

18:30.600 --> 18:33.353
You're looking at a man
who pried a 500-pound woman...

18:33.560 --> 18:35.039
...from a size six pump.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.316
Well, Private Bundy...

19:00.520 --> 19:02.590
...you followed my orders
and saved the sarge.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.394
Nice try, Panty Waist.

19:05.600 --> 19:10.116
If anyone's a hero around here,
it's Bundy.

19:10.480 --> 19:12.596
Gee, thanks, sarge.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.393
<i>I don't know but I've been told.</i>

19:16.640 --> 19:20.269
<i>Garbage stinks when it gets old.</i>

19:20.480 --> 19:23.552
<i>Let's go have a beer that's cold.</i>

19:23.800 --> 19:26.872
<i>And leave the Guard
Because we're too old.</i>

19:27.120 --> 19:29.236
<i>- Sound off.
- One, two.</i>

19:29.440 --> 19:32.432
<i>- Sound off.
- Three, four.</i>

19:36.000 --> 19:38.514
Bud, it's a good thing that you landed
on Mrs. D'Arcy...

19:38.720 --> 19:41.109
...or you could have really
gotten hurt.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.469
I am hurt, Kelly.

19:45.120 --> 19:46.155
Stop whining.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.954
The first time in months
you've been on top of a woman...

19:49.160 --> 19:51.116
...and she even screamed.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.711
Damn, I'm good.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.873
You know, Bud,
according to this insurance policy...

20:00.080 --> 20:02.878
...if your father comes home
looking half as bad as you...

20:03.080 --> 20:04.513
...we'll make a fortune.

20:12.720 --> 20:17.714
The garbage strike is over
because Corporal Bundy struck back.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.111
- Oh, Daddy.
- Oh, Al, you're home...

20:21.320 --> 20:23.515
...and all in one piece.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.153
How are my girls?

20:25.400 --> 20:28.915
Bud, you bulked up
since I've been gone.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.719
I'm in a body cast, Dad.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.791
Well, it looks good on you.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.079
Come on, Bud, I think Mom and Dad
would like to be alone.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.032
Okay. Okay.
But just don't touch my-!

20:41.240 --> 20:43.515
Don't touch my hand!

20:46.000 --> 20:48.673
Oh, Al, I'm so proud of you.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.713
You ended the garbage strike.
And you got a promotion.

20:51.920 --> 20:55.276
Yeah, Peg,
I was awarded the Bronze Dumpster.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.879
You know, Al, all wars are followed
by a baby boom.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.798
Let's repopulate.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.758
Oh, Peg, I can't.

21:03.960 --> 21:06.394
I was injured in battle.

21:07.560 --> 21:09.915
I'm not the man I was.

21:10.520 --> 21:11.509
Oh, great.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.678
One injury
and it's a pre-existing condition.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.590
Incoming!
