WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:48.780 --> 01:49.780
Squinch!

01:50.916 --> 01:51.974
Who goes there?

01:53.585 --> 01:56.349
Put that pig sticker down
before you hurt someone.

01:56.588 --> 01:57.680
Oh sorry, Kando.

01:57.890 --> 02:00.051
You're here to guard the
fort, not play games.

02:00.292 --> 02:01.292
Uh, yes sir, sir.

02:02.094 --> 02:03.094
All's well up here, huh?

02:03.295 --> 02:06.526
Oh shucks.
It's quieter than flea's hiccup.

02:06.832 --> 02:10.268
Well, with what we're guarding in
our mines, we can't be too careful.

02:15.140 --> 02:17.108
The Widgets' fortress...

02:17.442 --> 02:20.843
once I break in, I'll get
what I need to finish ...

02:21.013 --> 02:22.605
He-Man, once and for all.

02:24.750 --> 02:28.311
Forwards, my lackeys,
in the name of destruction!

02:39.164 --> 02:40.495
Hi Squinch.

02:42.534 --> 02:45.162
Oh, hallo there, Lara. What are
you doing up here?

02:45.404 --> 02:46.962
You are my boyfriend, remember?

02:47.172 --> 02:49.135
I thought you might be
lonesome all by yourself.

02:49.174 --> 02:52.610
Oh, I don't have time to get lonesome.
No, indeedy no!

02:55.747 --> 02:58.875
A guard's gotta be on
his toes all the time.

02:59.151 --> 03:03.019
Always ready to react
to the least, little sound.

03:05.023 --> 03:06.752
It's a whole gang of monsters!

03:10.362 --> 03:12.387
With Skeletor in the lead.

03:12.965 --> 03:15.695
Skeletor?
Oh yikes, we gotta do something like...

03:15.934 --> 03:17.196
like sounding the alarm!

03:17.502 --> 03:18.899
Yes, right, sounding the alarm!

03:42.160 --> 03:43.991
Here they come. What are we gonna do?

03:44.262 --> 03:45.991
This grease will slow them down.

03:53.238 --> 03:54.873
Hey, pretty slick work there, Lara.

03:54.873 --> 03:56.238
Squinch, don't just stand there.

03:56.475 --> 03:58.375
They'll try the south wall next.

03:59.778 --> 04:00.904
I'll get 'em.

04:04.282 --> 04:06.910
Uh... nice kitty kitty!

04:16.461 --> 04:21.329
Witless fools,
do I have to do everything for you?

04:25.070 --> 04:27.470
Skeletor is breaking through!

04:27.773 --> 04:30.207
Our only hope is to alert
our old friend He-Man.

04:30.509 --> 04:32.340
I pray he sees our signal.

04:45.190 --> 04:48.557
Well, it's good to get out of the
Palace now and then, right, Cringer?

04:48.660 --> 04:50.287
Oh...

04:50.996 --> 04:54.557
All this exercise is making me sleepy.

05:00.072 --> 05:03.701
Well, just be thankful you don't
have to work as hard as that Slotto.

05:06.511 --> 05:08.809
Come on, boy, you can make it.

05:09.981 --> 05:11.005
Oh no!

05:13.485 --> 05:16.045
Uh oh, no time to rest now, Cat.

05:17.923 --> 05:20.551
By the power of Grayskull.

05:25.831 --> 05:29.858
I have the power!

05:51.623 --> 05:53.682
Did you uh, lose something?

05:53.992 --> 05:55.016
He-Man!

05:56.995 --> 05:59.589
There you go, fella, good as new.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.863
Thanks, He-Man. I don't know
what we'd have done without you.

06:05.137 --> 06:07.935
I'm glad I could help, have a safe trip.

06:13.478 --> 06:15.810
Keep a sharp look out, Cat,
we might find others...

06:16.014 --> 06:17.743
that need our help today.

06:19.084 --> 06:21.319
I see something, already.

06:21.319 --> 06:24.750
That's the Widget signal. They only
use that in the worst emergencies.

06:25.423 --> 06:27.482
To Widget woods. Hurry!

06:39.337 --> 06:43.034
Victory! Now get in there, you two.

06:59.724 --> 07:01.885
Line up, little friends.

07:02.460 --> 07:06.760
Our master wants a word with you.

07:08.466 --> 07:10.593
Kando, step forward.

07:10.836 --> 07:13.634
Skeletor has come for you.

07:14.739 --> 07:17.606
You have no business here.
You go away and leave us alone.

07:18.076 --> 07:22.943
I shall, little commander,
as soon as you give me your Coridite.

07:23.481 --> 07:25.073
Coridite?  Never!

07:25.350 --> 07:29.013
Very well, perhaps my pet,
Panthor, will put you in a...

07:29.321 --> 07:31.881
more reasonable state of mind.

07:42.734 --> 07:46.192
Lets see you pick on someone
your own size, skull-face!

07:46.805 --> 07:47.805
He-Man!

07:48.240 --> 07:49.468
He-Man.

07:51.743 --> 07:54.109
Stop him, you fools!

08:06.191 --> 08:08.819
So, you want to play snap-the-whip, eh?

08:20.639 --> 08:24.075
Mer-Man, let's take him from both sides.

08:30.982 --> 08:34.816
You think you're handy with that
sword, huh? Well, try this:

08:36.288 --> 08:39.451
Anything you can pitch, I can hit back.

08:46.831 --> 08:48.025
No!

08:49.634 --> 08:53.798
Curse you, He-Man. Some day I'll
have the power to destroy you.

08:54.072 --> 08:55.437
Some day!

09:02.347 --> 09:05.043
Thanks, He-Man.
I thought we were doomed.

09:05.417 --> 09:07.408
What was Skeletor after, anyway?

09:07.652 --> 09:09.813
Our Coridite. But he didn't get any!

09:10.088 --> 09:11.122
Coridite?

09:11.122 --> 09:13.590
That's what the Sorceress
fashioned this harness from.

09:13.825 --> 09:15.554
It helps add to my power.

09:15.827 --> 09:18.728
It's too powerful for us to use.
So we keep what little we find...

09:18.964 --> 09:20.056
hidden in our mines.

09:20.365 --> 09:24.428
Yeah! Deep down where
no one's gonna find it.

09:24.769 --> 09:26.361
Well I hope you're right, Squinch.

09:29.407 --> 09:33.241
I'd hate to think what would happen
if Skeletor got his hands on it.

09:46.424 --> 09:48.051
Dolts! Half-wits!

09:48.994 --> 09:52.020
Bunglers! Brainless idiots!

09:52.097 --> 09:54.657
You couldn't even beat a
motley group of gnomes!

09:55.066 --> 09:59.765
But, Skeletor.
It was He-Man who...

10:00.038 --> 10:04.134
He-Man, always He-Man!

10:06.411 --> 10:09.847
If you had gotten your wretched
hands on the Widgets' Coridite...

10:09.948 --> 10:12.007
He-Man would be in my power now.

10:13.151 --> 10:14.778
Get out of my sight.

10:16.721 --> 10:17.881
Morons!

10:26.431 --> 10:29.958
As usual, you overreact, Skeletor.

10:30.268 --> 10:33.965
How else can I act,
when I'm surrounded by such fools!

10:34.339 --> 10:37.433
If I could fashion the Widgets'
Coridite into an amulet...

10:37.709 --> 10:40.303
it would work with my own dark powers...

10:40.845 --> 10:44.679
giving me the added
strength to destroy He-Man.

10:44.749 --> 10:45.773
True!

10:46.951 --> 10:50.887
But what you need,
is a clever ally to get it for you.

10:59.664 --> 11:00.790
In this form...

11:00.865 --> 11:04.392
the Widgets will never
suspect my real identity.

11:04.769 --> 11:08.762
Once they take me into their confidence,
the Coridite will be ours.

11:10.575 --> 11:13.408
For your sake, this had better work.

11:13.678 --> 11:16.943
Don't worry,
those kind-hearted fools would...

11:17.282 --> 11:20.911
never turn away a girl in distress.
Right, Panthor?

11:28.626 --> 11:30.958
Help!  Oh, help!

11:31.629 --> 11:33.358
What... what's that?

11:36.401 --> 11:39.859
Hey! Skeletor's mean kitty
is after some poor gal!

11:56.421 --> 11:58.912
Shoo, get outta here, you purple pest.

11:59.190 --> 12:01.090
Yeah, beat it, beast.

12:08.066 --> 12:10.227
Are you alright? I, think so.

12:10.535 --> 12:12.730
Why don't you come with
us and rest for a while?

12:13.037 --> 12:15.665
Oh, thank you.  You're very kind.

12:15.874 --> 12:18.934
She did it.  She's inside,

12:19.177 --> 12:22.271
and soon the Coridite will be mine!

12:32.891 --> 12:35.587
I don't know how to
thank you for saving me.

12:35.927 --> 12:39.522
Oh, it's alright, Miss, uh say...

12:39.597 --> 12:40.928
What is your name?

12:40.999 --> 12:45.299
I'm Nadira. I was walking
out in the forest when I got lost...

12:45.670 --> 12:48.537
then that horrible beast
started chasing me.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.067
Well, don't worry, you're safe here.

12:51.476 --> 12:54.912
But, I was travelling with
my family when I got lost.

12:55.747 --> 12:57.510
What if I never see them again?

12:57.916 --> 13:00.316
Why, we know the forest
like we know our own mines.

13:00.552 --> 13:01.985
We'll find her parents, won't we?

13:02.253 --> 13:04.153
Yeah. Sure we will. All for it.

13:05.790 --> 13:06.790
Oh thank you.

13:07.091 --> 13:09.855
Squinch, you just stay here and take
good care of Miss Nadira.

13:10.161 --> 13:11.389
Will do, Kando.

13:17.101 --> 13:20.298
Don't worry, missy.
Kando will find your folks.

13:25.209 --> 13:26.301
Aw.

13:26.477 --> 13:28.445
Maybe this will cheer you up.

13:31.049 --> 13:32.573
Oh, how pretty!

13:34.219 --> 13:36.949
Yeah, we got a whole mine full of 'em.

13:37.021 --> 13:38.021
Really?

13:38.223 --> 13:41.420
Oh!  I'd love to see them.

13:45.897 --> 13:48.491
Well, how'd you like those, eh?

13:48.833 --> 13:52.030
Oh, they're beautiful!
But what's behind that door?

13:52.971 --> 13:56.463
No, sorry, we don't allow
nobody back there, it's too risky.

13:56.841 --> 14:01.569
Oh, what does a brave, strong guard
like you, have to be scared about?

14:02.080 --> 14:05.174
Well, you gotta promise
not to touch anything.

14:09.087 --> 14:10.884
We call it Coridite.

14:11.122 --> 14:16.059
We don't have much, but well, if you use
it right, it can really pack a wallop.

14:17.629 --> 14:19.096
At last!

14:20.298 --> 14:21.492
Hey, you promised.

14:26.871 --> 14:28.202
Evil-Lyn.

14:28.573 --> 14:32.475
You little fool!
You've just sealed He-Man's doom...

14:32.777 --> 14:34.608
and your own as well!

14:42.652 --> 14:44.779
Help!  Help!

14:45.056 --> 14:46.785
That's Squinch. Something's wrong.

14:47.025 --> 14:48.025
C'mon.

14:48.660 --> 14:51.891
The Widgets are coming back.
But they won't stop me.

14:59.370 --> 15:00.370
Get down.

15:06.678 --> 15:10.170
So, Skeletor and Evil-Lyn
seek to duplicate He-Man's mighty powers.

15:13.551 --> 15:15.280
This must not be.

15:23.961 --> 15:25.087
It's Zoar.

15:25.463 --> 15:28.955
He-Man, Evil-Lyn has stolen
the Widget's Coridite.

15:29.300 --> 15:32.736
Even now Skeletor is shaping it
in the fires of Volcano Cave.

15:34.372 --> 15:37.705
Skeletor has the Widgets' Coridite.
There's no time to lose.

15:43.047 --> 15:46.312
Of all the stupid things to do!
Leading a stranger, an enemy...

15:46.551 --> 15:47.711
into our mines?

15:48.986 --> 15:51.216
Squinch didn't know she was an
enemy, Kando.

15:51.489 --> 15:52.489
Thats no excuse.

15:52.757 --> 15:57.391
Well, you're right, it is no excuse,
and I'm gonna get our Coridite back!

15:57.962 --> 15:59.190
Wait, where are you going?

15:59.464 --> 16:04.197
To Volcano Cave. That's the
only place Skeletor can melt it.

16:24.021 --> 16:26.080
Once the Coridite is hot enough...

16:27.091 --> 16:30.891
I'll mold it into the image
of my own breastplate.

16:37.435 --> 16:41.929
When worn against my skin, it will add
to my strength a hundred times over...

16:42.273 --> 16:45.936
making me mighty enough to crush He-Man!

16:49.814 --> 16:51.873
That's a pretty big boast, Skeletor.

16:52.984 --> 16:54.383
Would you care to prove it?

16:54.652 --> 16:55.652
He-Man!

16:55.753 --> 16:58.278
You mind the Coridite. I'll stop him.

16:59.490 --> 17:04.119
Demon of Stone, come forth!
Your mistress commands.

17:23.181 --> 17:27.914
Now, with one magical gesture,
the spell will be complete.

17:39.897 --> 17:42.525
Now I have the power!

17:46.904 --> 17:48.735
Come face me, He-Man...

17:49.307 --> 17:51.298
power against power.

18:17.535 --> 18:18.763
Skeletor.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.100
This is the way it had to end!

18:26.611 --> 18:30.012
With Skeletor triumphant at last!

18:33.611 --> 18:34.611
No!

18:34.819 --> 18:37.788
He-Man's winning!
But no matter, with one...

18:37.822 --> 18:39.687
well-timed spell, I'll...

18:40.691 --> 18:42.283
Who dares?

18:42.527 --> 18:44.188
We've come to help, He-Man.

18:46.831 --> 18:48.560
You little pests...

18:48.799 --> 18:52.496
I'll turn you all into toads for this.

18:53.104 --> 18:55.436
Oh, we'd love to stick around, Miss.
Nadira...

18:55.640 --> 18:57.267
but as you seem to be tied up.

18:57.542 --> 18:58.770
Squinch, come on!

18:59.911 --> 19:02.004
Why you... You!

19:09.287 --> 19:13.053
Fool, you'll never defeat me,
I have your power too.

19:19.497 --> 19:22.864
The only real power comes from
inside, Skeletor.

19:24.602 --> 19:25.602
From courage,

19:26.070 --> 19:30.803
honor and other things
you wouldn't understand!

19:35.980 --> 19:37.470
Brave words, He-Man.

19:37.715 --> 19:40.980
We'll see if they save
you the next time we meet.

19:52.830 --> 19:55.094
I want to thank you
again for all your help.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.111
Well, if it hadn't been for me, we wouldn't

19:57.136 --> 19:58.721
have gotten into trouble to begin with.

19:58.803 --> 20:00.134
Well, don't worry, Squinch.

20:00.404 --> 20:03.771
You're not the first to fall
for the charms of a pretty face.

20:04.141 --> 20:08.479
Oh, I'll tell ya, He-Man, Oh,
I'm through with women with for good!

20:08.479 --> 20:09.479
Oh, you are, huh?

20:09.513 --> 20:12.083
Oh, I didn't mean you,
Lara, I mean pretty women.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.084
What!

20:13.084 --> 20:16.212
No, uh...
you're pretty, for one of the guys.

20:16.287 --> 20:18.653
Oh, for one of the guys, huh?

20:20.691 --> 20:21.691
Ooh. Ow.

20:21.759 --> 20:23.056
No! Hi-ya.

20:26.864 --> 20:30.061
In today's story you saw how
the Widgets were fooled...

20:30.301 --> 20:34.237
by Evil-Lyn's disguise. They learned that
bad things can be made to look good...

20:34.505 --> 20:36.197
and why we should always be careful and

20:36.222 --> 20:38.124
question everything
that doesn't seem right.

20:38.576 --> 20:40.373
But it works both ways,

20:40.444 --> 20:43.936
and that's why the saying "You can't judge
a book by its cover" is so important.

20:44.281 --> 20:47.045
What it means is that
appearances can be deceiving...

20:47.385 --> 20:51.082
and you shouldn't judge books,
or people, by the way they look.

20:51.522 --> 20:54.047
It's what's inside that really counts.
