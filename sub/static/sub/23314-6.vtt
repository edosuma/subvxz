WEBVTT

00:04.161 --> 00:05.494
You have to stop.

00:05.497 --> 00:08.564
I can't keep letting you put
yourself, or me through this.

00:08.567 --> 00:10.364
I promise,

00:10.367 --> 00:11.901
no more.

00:11.903 --> 00:13.442
It has been nine years

00:13.445 --> 00:15.595
since I've even come
close to using my powers.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.853
Do you remember why
you became Black Lightning?

00:17.856 --> 00:19.960
You wanted to give the people hope.

00:20.559 --> 00:22.455
Somebody has to do something,

00:22.458 --> 00:23.913
because all of this policing,

00:23.915 --> 00:27.283
and marching, and praying,
it hasn't changed anything.

00:32.442 --> 00:36.332
It is time that people
know that Black Lightning...

00:37.914 --> 00:39.195
is back.

00:41.533 --> 00:43.466
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:43.468 --> 00:45.394
Thirty years ago, nine kids, all

00:45.397 --> 00:47.270
of whom displayed enhanced abilities,

00:47.272 --> 00:49.005
suddenly disappeared.

00:49.007 --> 00:50.773
The reporter was Alvin Pierce.

00:50.775 --> 00:52.375
- Grandpa?
- He was murdered.

00:52.377 --> 00:54.189
You need to take Black Lightning out,

00:54.192 --> 00:58.314
'cause if you don't my partners
are gonna turn you into dust.

00:58.316 --> 00:59.476
I found these on my student.

00:59.479 --> 01:02.384
The only way I could keep him from
hurting anyone was to blast him.

01:02.387 --> 01:04.001
Must be this new drug, Green Light.

01:04.004 --> 01:07.290
Khalil, your spinal cord
is now completely severed.

01:07.292 --> 01:08.825
You sayin' I'm not gonna walk again?

01:08.827 --> 01:11.094
I've been waiting to knock
you out since the sixth grade.

01:13.999 --> 01:15.833
Black Lightning is not making things

01:15.836 --> 01:17.575
better for the citizens of Freeland.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.635
Is he back?

01:18.637 --> 01:19.769
You know better than that.

01:19.771 --> 01:20.934
I pray that's true.

01:20.937 --> 01:22.504
Joey Toledo is back. Now, we're talking

01:22.507 --> 01:26.309
about the guy who worked for
the man who killed my father.

01:26.311 --> 01:28.745
- Where is Tobias?
- I'm not telling you nothing.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.882
You should've stayed away.

01:34.000 --> 01:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.817 --> 01:52.001
Right away, sir.

01:58.906 --> 02:01.629
Listen up. Tip said Black
Lightning is on the East End.

02:01.632 --> 02:03.192
I'm taking 33rd Street.

02:03.195 --> 02:05.111
Adam and Baker squads on me.

02:05.114 --> 02:07.584
Henderson, I want you
to take MLK Street.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.550
Charlie and David squads with him.

02:09.554 --> 02:10.620
Copy, Chief.

02:10.622 --> 02:11.582
Let's roll.

02:11.585 --> 02:14.167
Everybody, be safe, heads
on the swivel, let's do this.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.303
We got him.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.867
Black Lightning? Come
on. Let's get out of here.

03:08.546 --> 03:09.879
I'm here, man.

03:12.917 --> 03:14.117
Are you with me?

03:23.161 --> 03:25.261
Tobias is in Freeland, Gambi.

03:26.898 --> 03:30.166
Tobias... Tobias
is in Freeland, Gambi.

03:35.407 --> 03:37.807
Breathe, Jefferson. Breathe!

03:38.777 --> 03:40.245
Call Lynn Stewart.

03:41.329 --> 03:42.432
It's Doctor Stewart.

03:42.435 --> 03:43.646
It's Gambi.

03:43.648 --> 03:45.982
Jefferson's in the hurt
locker, and it's bad.

03:48.130 --> 03:53.222

04:01.390 --> 04:03.189
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

04:03.191 --> 04:04.501
Cheers.

04:05.661 --> 04:07.413
What the hell happened to you?

04:07.416 --> 04:09.329
I just fought Black Lightning.

04:09.331 --> 04:11.970
I mean, one more minute and I
would've killed him. I swear.

04:11.973 --> 04:14.374
I mean, something's wrong with
his head. He looked half-dead.

04:15.450 --> 04:17.119
So why didn't you finish him?

04:20.833 --> 04:22.275
I tried.

04:22.277 --> 04:24.010
But I, but I was all on my own.

04:24.012 --> 04:27.580
And he trashed my
gun and I couldn't take him.

04:27.582 --> 04:29.548
I tipped our guy in the department.

04:31.606 --> 04:33.453
There was a time you
could depend on white folks

04:33.455 --> 04:35.061
to be professional.

04:35.064 --> 04:38.391
Nowadays white boys just as lazy
and shiftless as the brothas.

04:39.407 --> 04:42.369
- Tori's protection team checked in on schedule.
- Hmm.

04:42.372 --> 04:43.814
- All is well.
- Hmm.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.116
Tori's under protection?

04:45.119 --> 04:48.639
Lady Eve sent me powder
from ground albino bones,

04:48.642 --> 04:50.646
trying to mess with my head.

04:50.649 --> 04:52.148
Or issue a warning.

04:53.833 --> 04:56.176
Yeah, and you're bleeding on my floor.

04:56.179 --> 04:57.830
Sorry, Boss.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.077
Make sure we got a crew
in lockup on standby

05:00.080 --> 05:02.257
and let me know as soon
as the cops get him.

05:03.719 --> 05:06.142
Black Lightning doesn't
live out the night.

05:09.758 --> 05:13.827
I don't get it. We roll the
cavalry, and he's gone. Disappears.

05:15.330 --> 05:17.597
Eyewitnesses saw him get into a van.

05:18.259 --> 05:21.067
Did you get a plate?
Description of the van?

05:21.069 --> 05:24.017
They were fans, sir.
So, willful amnesia.

05:24.020 --> 05:26.873
How does a criminal
and a freak have fans?

05:31.012 --> 05:33.748
Where'd you say you got that tip, sir?

05:33.751 --> 05:35.515
I didn't.

05:40.122 --> 05:41.621
I gotta take this.

05:47.028 --> 05:48.928
Look, I
know I should've waited,

05:48.930 --> 05:52.232
but Joey Toledo has tried to
kill me over and over again.

05:52.235 --> 05:54.667
And he was Tobias's right-hand man.

05:54.669 --> 05:56.536
I couldn't miss a
chance to go after him.

05:58.962 --> 06:00.940
I didn't get him, though.

06:04.361 --> 06:05.578
What's that?

06:05.581 --> 06:07.814
I brought a portable,

06:07.816 --> 06:09.549
took a brain scan while you were out.

06:11.219 --> 06:12.519
And?

06:13.555 --> 06:16.045
Anomalous, but normal for you.

06:16.048 --> 06:19.125
If you did have a brain
bleed, it's gone by now.

06:20.462 --> 06:23.763
Your powers turbo-charged
your recovery system.

06:23.765 --> 06:25.580
May not heal as fast you used to, but

06:25.583 --> 06:27.302
it's still twice as fast as normal.

06:29.504 --> 06:31.738
Well, it doesn't feel twice as fast.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.455
It's good to be in your hands.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.181
Stop it, Jefferson!

06:39.184 --> 06:41.347
You're pulling me back into this mess,

06:41.349 --> 06:42.682
and I don't like it.

06:42.684 --> 06:45.518
I hate this. I hate having
to stitch you back together,

06:45.520 --> 06:47.284
living in fear of turning on the news

06:47.287 --> 06:50.345
and somebody finding your
body dead in the gutter.

06:50.348 --> 06:53.262
I watched Tobias murder my father.

06:53.265 --> 06:55.527
He's here in Freeland, so
what do you expect me to do?

06:55.530 --> 06:57.845
I don't give a damn, Jefferson.

06:57.848 --> 07:00.600
Your father is dead.

07:00.602 --> 07:03.570
And nothing you can do
is gonna bring him back.

07:03.573 --> 07:04.919
Wow.

07:04.922 --> 07:08.023
You have no idea what this does to
me every time I see you like this.

07:09.849 --> 07:12.325
It's too much.

07:13.014 --> 07:14.881
It's... It's just too much.

08:01.931 --> 08:03.473
Shoot!

08:19.481 --> 08:20.847
Back up.

08:28.356 --> 08:29.834
Come with me.

08:29.837 --> 08:31.130
Both of you!

08:31.826 --> 08:33.359
Stay on the ground.

08:41.135 --> 08:42.602
Get off of me.

08:46.537 --> 08:47.803
Long night?

08:47.806 --> 08:49.575
I just didn't sleep very well.

08:49.578 --> 08:51.844
- Because, you had company?
- Yeah.

08:51.846 --> 08:54.416
Company named insomnia.

08:54.419 --> 08:57.517
Boring. Let
me show you something.

09:03.224 --> 09:06.481
Aren't these the weirdest brain scans?

09:06.484 --> 09:08.661
These are the scans of
the Green Light addicts?

09:08.663 --> 09:09.674
Mmm-hmm.

09:09.677 --> 09:13.755
Gray matter should be dark, but
it's lit up like a Christmas tree.

09:13.758 --> 09:16.442
Have you ever seen, like,
a scan like this before?

09:18.039 --> 09:19.272
No.

09:21.931 --> 09:24.843
Would you do me a favor and get
me one of those coffees, please?

09:24.846 --> 09:27.380
Sure thing, boss. Your usual?

09:27.382 --> 09:28.948
Yeah, thanks.

09:55.710 --> 09:57.076
This way.

09:57.078 --> 09:58.244
Here she is.

10:02.550 --> 10:04.751
Hey, maybe you shouldn't
workout so hard.

10:04.753 --> 10:05.985
No, I'm fine.

10:10.058 --> 10:12.252
Thank you for coming to get me.

10:12.255 --> 10:13.793
You okay?

10:13.795 --> 10:15.328
Yeah.

10:17.999 --> 10:20.833
Damn, you stay getting arrested.

10:21.736 --> 10:22.935
Shut up.

10:27.642 --> 10:29.742
You know, let me ask you a question.

10:29.744 --> 10:31.380
Should I have you committed?

10:31.381 --> 10:33.680
Because you have obviously
lost your damn mind.

10:33.682 --> 10:36.349
That statue, Dad, is an
insult to black people.

10:36.351 --> 10:38.676
Glorifying a national traitor.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.720
You broke the law, Anissa.

10:40.722 --> 10:43.656
That gives the police
an excuse to hurt you,

10:43.658 --> 10:45.725
and on top of that, you used guns.

10:45.728 --> 10:48.387
- Guns.
- They were water guns.

10:48.390 --> 10:51.764
They looked enough like real
guns to be the end of you.

10:56.538 --> 10:58.517
All it takes is for one cop,

10:58.520 --> 11:02.408
one cop to see your color instead
of your humanity and decide,

11:02.410 --> 11:04.228
"better dead than sorry."

11:04.231 --> 11:06.661
Look, you are a black woman.

11:06.664 --> 11:08.666
You don't have the
luxury of being naive.

11:08.669 --> 11:12.009
I know, I know. You have said
that like a thousand times.

11:12.012 --> 11:13.386
- Okay, then hear it.
- Okay.

11:13.388 --> 11:14.487
And I will stop saying it.

11:14.489 --> 11:15.655
Okay.

11:19.961 --> 11:21.830
Look, I love you.

11:21.833 --> 11:24.597
I don't want to lose you because
you went along with something

11:24.599 --> 11:26.637
that you should have walked away from.

11:29.270 --> 11:30.603
Okay.

11:44.185 --> 11:46.152
Okay, so.

11:47.956 --> 11:51.057
Biologically super powers are possible.

11:51.059 --> 11:54.093
E equals MC square. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.095 --> 11:58.197
Mass is a function of
energy. Mitochondria.

11:59.422 --> 12:02.322
Mitochondria provide
energy in human cells.

12:02.325 --> 12:04.837
That's what this stuff
from my grandfather is,

12:04.839 --> 12:10.478
research on human mitochondria that
I don't know how to read. Great.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.947
Are you talking to yourself in here?

12:13.950 --> 12:15.852
What, did you hit your head or something

12:15.855 --> 12:17.383
when you were arrested, Harriet?

12:17.385 --> 12:18.918
Okay, you know what?

12:18.920 --> 12:22.321
Mess around and get hit in your
head. Keep listening at my door.

12:22.323 --> 12:24.724
Okay! Geez! When you get a moment,

12:24.726 --> 12:26.926
could you please check
my Pre-Calc homework?

12:26.928 --> 12:29.629
- Lot of mouth to need a favor.
- Thank you!

12:32.967 --> 12:35.034
All right, let me see, Jennifer.

12:35.036 --> 12:35.755
Hmm.

12:35.758 --> 12:38.217
I would be the only one in
the family who's bad at math.

12:38.220 --> 12:42.207
Mmm-mmm. Everybody winds up
in the mud somewhere in math.

12:42.210 --> 12:43.743
Plus eight.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.746
Oh, here, it's perfect.

12:47.515 --> 12:49.115
You knew that.

12:49.117 --> 12:50.964
- Here.
- Boo-yah!

12:55.496 --> 12:57.596
What's up? You all right?

12:59.194 --> 13:00.226
Yeah.

13:01.429 --> 13:02.829
Mmm-mmm.

13:02.831 --> 13:06.232
That was totally not convincing at all.

13:07.101 --> 13:09.235
Is everything okay with you and Khalil?

13:12.548 --> 13:16.651
I hate to say this or
even think it, but...

13:16.654 --> 13:20.413
I was so looking forward to
dating and having a boyfriend

13:20.415 --> 13:24.383
and I used to dream about
prom and going dancing.

13:24.385 --> 13:25.484
Yeah.

13:27.178 --> 13:30.313
And, with Khalil, that
can't happen the way you saw it.

13:31.826 --> 13:34.983
All I can see in my future is
struggling to help him get around.

13:34.986 --> 13:37.363
You know, standing with
him on the sidelines

13:37.365 --> 13:40.633
instead of actually
being on the dance floor.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.662
And I'm awful for that.

13:43.665 --> 13:46.647
No, listen.

13:46.650 --> 13:49.708
You're human, with a
hard choice to make,

13:51.646 --> 13:52.812
that's all.

13:55.516 --> 13:58.618
Okay. Draw in some energy.

14:03.858 --> 14:05.258
How's that?

14:05.960 --> 14:07.059
Good.

14:09.775 --> 14:11.342
Right hand.

14:14.713 --> 14:15.979
Left.

14:22.006 --> 14:23.693
How's does that feel?

14:23.696 --> 14:24.996
Good.

14:27.487 --> 14:29.187
Real good.

14:30.248 --> 14:32.592
You know, sometimes I, uh,

14:32.595 --> 14:36.088
wonder if Lynn's right
about my powers being a drug.

14:36.090 --> 14:38.959
Endorphins is what you feel, that's all.

14:38.962 --> 14:40.563
How's your head now?

14:42.096 --> 14:43.863
Yeah, so far so good.

14:43.865 --> 14:45.956
Your powers are largely neurological.

14:45.959 --> 14:50.403
Your brain can pick up and use
electricity the way a normal person

14:50.405 --> 14:52.438
picks up and uses a pencil or a hammer.

14:52.440 --> 14:54.240
You sure there's no pain now?

14:54.243 --> 14:57.844
I told you I'm good. Did you
figure out what went wrong?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.879
Well, we're screwing with
forces of nature, Jefferson.

15:00.882 --> 15:02.415
That suit of yours is what keeps you

15:02.417 --> 15:04.784
from blowing out your nervous
system when you use your power

15:04.786 --> 15:07.537
and when the resistance
is set too high...

15:07.540 --> 15:08.854
There's feedback.

15:08.856 --> 15:11.457
That's what was wrong.

15:11.459 --> 15:13.693
Okay. Thanks for fixing it.

15:14.495 --> 15:17.964
Now, we got work to do.

15:17.967 --> 15:21.753
Tobias is not on the run,

15:21.756 --> 15:23.914
he's right here in Freeland and I'm going

15:23.917 --> 15:26.261
to put his albino ass right in his grave.

15:26.264 --> 15:28.274
Hey, slow down, Jefferson.

15:29.353 --> 15:31.120
You're talking about
cold-blooded murder.

15:31.123 --> 15:33.012
You're Black Lightning, man.

15:33.975 --> 15:38.250
A vengeful son is a far cry from a
hero seeking justice for Freeland.

15:39.253 --> 15:42.054
Freeland is in crisis
because of Green Light.

15:42.056 --> 15:45.491
Toledo is behind that.
Tobias is behind him.

15:45.493 --> 15:48.694
So ridding Freeland
of Tobias is justice.

15:48.696 --> 15:52.545
Maybe Toledo is behind Green
Light. Maybe Tobias is, too.

15:52.548 --> 15:54.667
What do you mean "maybe?"

15:54.669 --> 15:57.770
If Toledo is around,
Tobias is holding his leash.

15:59.181 --> 16:03.514
I feel like every time I bring up
Tobias to you, I get resistance.

16:03.517 --> 16:06.245
Yeah. You're acting like you
don't even want me to catch him.

16:06.248 --> 16:08.014
That's ridiculous.

16:08.016 --> 16:09.061
Is it?

16:09.064 --> 16:11.083
You couldn't wait for
me to get in the suit.

16:11.085 --> 16:13.654
Now you're gun-shy about Tobias.

16:13.657 --> 16:15.226
Why is that?

16:16.657 --> 16:19.358
There is no "why," Jefferson.

16:19.367 --> 16:21.872
Uh, other than The 100 had nine years

16:21.875 --> 16:24.637
to get strong with no Black Lightning.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.401
They've got state-of-the-art
technology, political protection,

16:28.403 --> 16:30.136
lookouts on every other corner...

16:30.138 --> 16:32.104
You know what? Save your history lesson.

16:33.187 --> 16:36.375
I have lived with the murder
of my father all my life.

16:36.377 --> 16:39.106
Tobias vanished without a trace once,

16:39.109 --> 16:42.848
and now he's right here under our noses.

16:45.186 --> 16:46.752
I'm gonna take him out.

16:46.754 --> 16:48.187
Period.

17:10.595 --> 17:11.894
Morning.

17:16.772 --> 17:18.256
What do you want?

17:18.259 --> 17:20.431
That's a little harsh, Lynn.

17:20.434 --> 17:23.611
Well, you've never come by
before. Now you break in.

17:26.819 --> 17:28.453
I apologize.

17:28.455 --> 17:31.758
I wanted to speak with you before
your research assistant gets in.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.126
Of course.

17:34.230 --> 17:36.063
You know our hours.

17:37.665 --> 17:41.337
I'm concerned that Jefferson is
on the verge of crossing a line.

17:41.340 --> 17:43.032
He crossed the line when he decided

17:43.035 --> 17:44.771
to go back to being Black Lightning.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.866
Not like this.

17:46.869 --> 17:50.108
He's going to kill the man
who murdered his father.

17:50.111 --> 17:53.705
You do something like that, you
kill something inside yourself,

17:53.708 --> 17:55.541
maybe the best part.

17:56.737 --> 17:59.353
You raised him to be Black Lightning.

17:59.356 --> 18:01.420
His father raised him
to be Jefferson Pierce,

18:01.422 --> 18:04.323
but he was formed on
the streets of Freeland.

18:04.325 --> 18:05.858
And no amount of education,

18:05.860 --> 18:09.220
or Olympics gets that out
of you. He's complicated.

18:09.223 --> 18:15.376
And no one understands him like
you do, not me, maybe not even him.

18:15.379 --> 18:18.517
So you might be the only one
who can save him from himself.

18:20.774 --> 18:22.741
You know what?

18:22.744 --> 18:24.944
You and Jeff chose this, not me.

18:24.947 --> 18:26.813
- Leave me out of it.
- Lynn...

18:26.815 --> 18:28.470
I have work to do.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.939
_

18:53.942 --> 18:56.344
Usually we catch these guys when somebody

18:56.347 --> 18:58.429
talks or their habits.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.098
There are some special health concerns

19:20.101 --> 19:22.333
that affect individuals with albinism.

19:22.336 --> 19:24.136
Eye issues are a concern,

19:24.139 --> 19:25.895
and they suffer from a much higher

19:25.898 --> 19:29.287
incidence of psoriasis and skin cancer.

19:29.290 --> 19:31.157
So regular screenings are a must.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.702
Albinism is a complex disorder.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.168
You get your skin, hair and eye color...

19:36.171 --> 19:38.496
- Ugh, I am so done with her.
- Huh?

19:38.499 --> 19:40.051
Look at what she just posted, look.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.366
Let's go. What you wanna do?

19:42.369 --> 19:44.090
- Come on! Don't walk away from me!
- That's Jennifer Pierce,

19:44.092 --> 19:46.826
Miss Black Becky. Trying
to talk like she's white

19:46.828 --> 19:48.995
'cause she thinks she's
better than everybody else.

19:48.997 --> 19:50.496
I'm so done.

19:50.498 --> 19:51.733
Hey, you shoulda beat her ass again.

19:51.735 --> 19:53.665
Yeah, you're right.

19:53.668 --> 19:55.006
Let's go.

20:01.609 --> 20:02.775
Hey, Mom.

20:02.778 --> 20:05.163
- Hey.
- Hope you don't mind me stopping by.

20:05.166 --> 20:07.366
You know, I missed you at
family dinner the other night.

20:08.567 --> 20:11.502
Are you still coming or is it
too weird between you and Dad?

20:11.505 --> 20:13.753
Your father and I have been getting
into it lately, but we'll be okay.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.813
One thing's for sure, Dad's nose is

20:15.816 --> 20:18.157
wide open for you and it always will be.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.483
That's not
always enough, baby.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.719
I get it. It's not meant to be.

20:23.749 --> 20:25.164
What do you mean by that?

20:25.166 --> 20:27.206
I used to hear you and dad
arguing when I was a kid.

20:28.919 --> 20:30.986
- You did?
- I couldn't hear that well.

20:30.989 --> 20:33.122
I just know you didn't
like being the mistress.

20:34.894 --> 20:37.131
Your father never cheated on me, Anissa.

20:37.134 --> 20:40.035
Mom, Dad is married to saving the world.

20:40.038 --> 20:42.682
You didn't like coming in second.

20:42.685 --> 20:44.051
I get it.

20:44.054 --> 20:45.959
I feel the same calling.

20:45.962 --> 20:48.152
You don't know how right you are.

20:48.155 --> 20:50.156
Is this for me?

20:50.158 --> 20:52.514
No, it's actually for me.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.022
So there's some lab
results inside and a sample,

20:55.025 --> 20:56.625
but I can't make sense of it.

20:56.628 --> 20:59.062
- Well, where did you get it?
- Belonged to Dad's dad.

20:59.065 --> 21:02.299
He called it a self-discovery project.

21:03.375 --> 21:05.509
What is it you're not telling me?

21:09.934 --> 21:12.134
Never mind.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.482
Your whole body just screamed like

21:14.485 --> 21:16.464
it did when you were a three-year-old.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.653
Just promise you'll tell
me when you can, okay?

21:23.745 --> 21:25.550
I will.

21:25.553 --> 21:27.392
I'll take a look at
this as soon as I can.

21:27.395 --> 21:29.678
- All right. Thank you, Mom.
- Sure.

22:10.128 --> 22:12.084
Jefferson...

22:12.087 --> 22:14.807
I don't know what you're up to,

22:14.809 --> 22:18.381
but there is a difference
between you and Tobias.

22:18.384 --> 22:20.450
You need to keep it that way.

22:57.758 --> 22:59.444
Who's there?

23:03.306 --> 23:04.872
Do you know who I am?

23:06.630 --> 23:10.678
You specialize in treatin'
people with albinism.

23:12.433 --> 23:14.909
Do you have an albino patient?

23:14.912 --> 23:17.436
A gangster named Tobias Whale?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.277
Okay, okay.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.575
He never gives his name,
but he has my home address.

23:22.578 --> 23:24.959
He knows where my kids go to school.

23:26.928 --> 23:29.729
Please, don't hurt me.

23:29.732 --> 23:31.817
I have to treat him.
I don't have a choice.

23:31.819 --> 23:33.352
Whoa, whoa.

23:33.354 --> 23:36.917
I'm not gonna hurt
you, I'm gonna help you.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.791
When's his next appointment?

23:38.793 --> 23:40.945
He doesn't make appointments.

23:40.948 --> 23:44.225
I get a call from this scary
lady to stay open after I close.

23:44.228 --> 23:45.961
I do, and he shows up.

23:47.201 --> 23:49.386
All right, call her. Tell
her you need to see him.

23:49.389 --> 23:50.936
No, I can't.

23:50.939 --> 23:53.467
He'll kill us all. I know he will.

23:53.470 --> 23:54.836
Look...

23:56.144 --> 23:58.944
I can help you and your family.

23:59.516 --> 24:01.566
But you gotta help me.

24:01.569 --> 24:04.450
Or you can stay under his thumb.

24:05.319 --> 24:09.455
But sooner or later, he will crush you.

24:15.689 --> 24:18.923
Call me if you change your mind.

24:32.680 --> 24:34.169
Jefferson.

24:34.172 --> 24:36.614
Yeah. I know. I know, it's on my desk.

24:36.617 --> 24:39.988
Good, but you know I monitor social media

24:39.991 --> 24:42.857
for cyberbullying of Garfield students?

24:43.558 --> 24:46.125
Um... take a look at this.

24:47.461 --> 24:48.527
Scroll down.

24:57.271 --> 24:59.138
I'm around if you need anything.

25:02.169 --> 25:03.502
Thank you.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.221
Okay. Now.

25:15.223 --> 25:18.720
Some people like to study in groups...

25:18.723 --> 25:21.316
and suffixes...

25:21.319 --> 25:23.419
and prefixes.

25:24.686 --> 25:27.600
Personally, I'm not a huge fan...

25:47.222 --> 25:50.023
I'm guessing you already know
what they're saying about me.

25:52.365 --> 25:53.731
Yeah.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.386
You know, Jen,

26:01.397 --> 26:05.999
a cultural aftershock of slavery...

26:07.808 --> 26:13.045
that sometimes when one
black person gets ahead,

26:14.327 --> 26:17.662
another feels like it ruins
their chances, so they lash out.

26:19.363 --> 26:21.163
It's called "Crabs in a barrel."

26:23.124 --> 26:29.475
Look, no one is an expert
on what is or is not black

26:30.730 --> 26:34.265
because black is
everything under the sun.

26:40.608 --> 26:42.420
That actually backfired on her.

26:42.423 --> 26:43.722
Hmm.

26:43.725 --> 26:45.303
Lots of people jumped on her,

26:45.306 --> 26:48.381
saying that black people need to stop

26:48.384 --> 26:52.420
with the good hair, bad hair,
light skin, dark skin stuff.

26:54.171 --> 26:56.738
But it's the Khalil
comments that bother you?

26:58.911 --> 27:00.010
Yeah.

27:01.173 --> 27:03.573
Well, he's a young man in a lot of pain.

27:04.932 --> 27:08.200
Could be the pain
talking, not the person.

27:09.440 --> 27:11.306
Yeah, I was thinking that.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.161
Or...

27:17.032 --> 27:20.342
the pain could be
revealing who he really is

27:20.345 --> 27:23.079
when things don't go his way.

27:24.675 --> 27:26.041
How do I know which?

27:28.034 --> 27:30.295
Well, you listen

27:30.298 --> 27:33.433
and stay honest with
yourself about what you hear.

27:37.672 --> 27:40.506
Right now, I would just
give him some space.

27:43.926 --> 27:45.358
I need to talk to him.

27:48.927 --> 27:50.093
Yeah.

27:54.913 --> 27:58.984
You will not
replace us! You will not replace us!

27:58.986 --> 28:01.842
You will not replace us!

28:04.484 --> 28:08.219
This counter-protest began calling
for the preservation of all history,

28:08.222 --> 28:10.733
but was hijacked by white nationalists.

28:10.736 --> 28:12.697
It turned violent, then tragically,

28:12.700 --> 28:16.272
a white nationalist drove his
car into a crowd of students,

28:16.275 --> 28:18.108
killing 19-year-old Katie Smith.

28:18.111 --> 28:20.506
Ugh. My goodness.

28:20.508 --> 28:21.803
What, did you know her?

28:24.145 --> 28:27.105
Not really, but I knew her.

28:27.108 --> 28:28.614
So sad.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.295
I just... I don't know.

28:31.298 --> 28:35.186
Makes you wish there was something
you can do to stop this madness.

28:41.694 --> 28:43.256
Yo, you are trippin'.

28:43.259 --> 28:45.685
Trippin'? Me?

28:45.688 --> 28:47.955
You've been avoiding me.

28:47.958 --> 28:49.811
I text you, you don't text me back.

28:49.814 --> 28:52.114
But, what, you have
the time to post shade?

28:54.074 --> 28:56.208
Maybe we should take a break.

28:57.203 --> 28:58.964
Until what?

28:58.967 --> 29:00.724
I walk?

29:00.727 --> 29:03.816
If it weren't for you, I
wouldn't have gone to that march

29:03.818 --> 29:05.686
and I wouldn't be in this chair.

29:05.689 --> 29:08.190
Wow. Really?

29:08.193 --> 29:11.209
- So you're blaming me now?
- It's your fault, Becky.

29:12.798 --> 29:14.631
Hey, you got everything.

29:16.642 --> 29:18.008
What I got?

29:18.011 --> 29:19.477
Nothing.

29:20.814 --> 29:24.553
You see, I did everything right.
Yeah, I played by the rules.

29:24.556 --> 29:29.274
No drugs, no alcohol, stayed
out of jail, and had no kids.

29:30.378 --> 29:33.131
Hell, I went to church every Sunday

29:33.134 --> 29:35.999
and God still took my legs.

29:36.002 --> 29:37.535
You can't see it that...

29:37.538 --> 29:41.774
That's the only way to see
it! Don't you understand?

29:48.061 --> 29:51.522
Khalil, I'll pray for you.

29:51.525 --> 29:53.625
Yeah, well, you keep your damn prayers.

29:55.104 --> 29:56.703
Now get out.

29:56.706 --> 29:58.137
Yeah?

29:58.139 --> 30:00.339
Black Lightning, it's Dr. Mayfield.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.707
I, uh...

30:02.899 --> 30:04.165
I called.

30:04.168 --> 30:06.834
Said he needed to come in
to redo a test for psoriasis.

30:06.837 --> 30:09.600
- What time?
- After I close, at 6:00.

30:09.603 --> 30:11.283
You're coming, right?

30:11.285 --> 30:12.784
Definitely.

30:16.921 --> 30:18.521
So, how'd it go?

30:19.884 --> 30:23.303
I should've waited like you
told me and given him space.

30:24.297 --> 30:26.230
Can we please just go home?

30:26.233 --> 30:27.599
Yeah.

31:32.206 --> 31:34.527
Hey, sweetie. I'm glad you called.

31:34.530 --> 31:37.242
I inputted the organic sequencing
from the data you gave me

31:37.244 --> 31:39.446
and cross-referenced
it with known sequences.

31:39.449 --> 31:41.947
That way, I can tell what
it is and what it does.

31:41.949 --> 31:44.316
I'll let you know when I have it.

31:44.318 --> 31:45.551
Okay.

31:45.554 --> 31:47.421
Mom, actually...

31:50.958 --> 31:53.392
I'm calling because
I need to tell you...

31:55.296 --> 31:59.898
More like show you the real
reason I need the research.

31:59.900 --> 32:01.233
Can I come over?

32:01.235 --> 32:03.702
Yeah. I'm still at the lab.

32:03.704 --> 32:07.139
Just use the intercom when you
get here and I'll let you in.

32:07.141 --> 32:08.373
Bye.

32:18.385 --> 32:19.518
Yes?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.587
Lynn, you have to get involved.

32:21.589 --> 32:24.022
Please. He's about to kill a man.

32:53.350 --> 32:54.816
Hmm.

32:57.758 --> 33:01.496
So you want to write
about me? Huh, Uncle Tom?

33:05.199 --> 33:09.334
It's time for you to eat your damn words.

33:11.530 --> 33:12.839
Daddy.

33:18.347 --> 33:19.578
Daddy.

34:09.063 --> 34:11.929
Jefferson, I'm
putting you through to Lynn.

34:11.931 --> 34:16.400
June 28th, 1994
and October 7th, 2001.

34:16.402 --> 34:19.804
Your daughters came into
this world on those dates.

34:19.806 --> 34:22.728
You're an amazing dad,
their anchor in this world,

34:22.731 --> 34:26.378
but you can't be if you let
the air out of your soul.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.481
And that's exactly what will
happen if you commit murder, Jeff.

34:29.483 --> 34:31.219
It will shred your soul.

34:31.223 --> 34:34.033
It's already shredded.

34:34.036 --> 34:35.353
Goodbye, Lynn.

34:35.356 --> 34:37.556
No, you think I don't understand.

34:37.559 --> 34:41.327
I had some real talk with
Anissa and I've been thinking.

34:42.830 --> 34:47.563
I realize I was mad about not
always being the first in your life.

34:47.567 --> 34:50.402
But Black Lightning is part
of you and I can't deny that

34:50.404 --> 34:53.304
just because I want Jefferson
Pierce all to myself.

34:53.306 --> 34:56.063
This isn't me fighting with you anymore.

34:56.067 --> 34:58.510
I accept who and what you are.

34:59.294 --> 35:01.647
This is about me reminding
you that you're a hero.

35:03.511 --> 35:05.319
Not a murderer.

35:08.722 --> 35:10.541
What was that?

35:10.544 --> 35:13.031
Someone's breaking in.
They're coming this way.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.550
Okay, hide. I'm coming.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.644
Did you get
it? Come on. Hurry up.

35:33.647 --> 35:35.080
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

35:36.024 --> 35:38.358
- Get away from her!
- Stop!

35:38.361 --> 35:39.960
Get away from her now!

35:43.757 --> 35:46.220
Get on the floor! Get on the damn floor!

35:54.034 --> 35:55.364
What?

35:57.614 --> 35:58.908
You thought he missed?

36:13.027 --> 36:14.293
Let her go.

37:11.378 --> 37:12.903
Anissa?

37:13.737 --> 37:15.937
What?

37:29.470 --> 37:32.504
No broken bones, but
she has a concussion

37:32.506 --> 37:34.773
and quite a few bruises and burns.

37:36.911 --> 37:39.469
What the hell was she doing?

37:40.581 --> 37:42.414
What you do.

37:43.451 --> 37:46.118
She has powers, Jeff.

37:47.489 --> 37:49.021
Oh, God.

37:49.024 --> 37:51.190
She has powers.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.667
She has powers.

38:09.906 --> 38:12.473
Don't you worry about a thing.

38:12.476 --> 38:14.009
I got you.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.485
Just remember this and never forget.

38:17.488 --> 38:19.766
There's two ways to walk in this world.

38:19.769 --> 38:21.606
Either you're gonna be one of the sheep?

38:21.609 --> 38:24.024
Oh, yeah.

38:24.027 --> 38:26.255
Or you gonna be a wolf?

38:26.258 --> 38:28.820
I think you made the right decision.

38:28.823 --> 38:30.945
Thanks, Mr. Tobias.

38:33.511 --> 38:35.677
But I don't know what I can do.

38:37.404 --> 38:39.471
Better yet I can't even walk.

38:39.474 --> 38:42.367
You will. I promise.

38:42.370 --> 38:47.264
You will know strength, be
strength, and believe me,

38:47.267 --> 38:49.211
it's so much fun.

38:55.347 --> 38:57.364
Hello, Evelyn.

38:57.367 --> 38:58.900
Peter Gambi.

39:00.215 --> 39:03.036
How did you get past all my security?

39:03.039 --> 39:05.495
Evelyn, I taught you
everything you know,

39:05.498 --> 39:07.198
not everything I know.

39:15.290 --> 39:17.481
You are so corny.

39:17.484 --> 39:20.989
You get to be corny when
you're technically retired.

39:20.992 --> 39:25.470
If you had just gone into business
with me after I left the Agency,

39:25.473 --> 39:28.807
you would be wealthily retired.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.185
I wouldn't know what to do with it.

39:32.188 --> 39:34.445
Point of clarification,

39:34.447 --> 39:37.215
the Pierce family is
supposed to be off-limits.

39:37.217 --> 39:38.449
That's the deal, right?

39:39.386 --> 39:41.055
It is.

39:41.058 --> 39:44.555
But Dr. Lynn Stewart is highly capable.

39:44.557 --> 39:47.875
And she's been doing
research that's off-limits.

39:47.878 --> 39:51.399
We just wanted her files, that's all.

39:51.402 --> 39:53.665
Didn't expect her to be there

39:53.667 --> 39:57.635
or the meta-human that
attacked the Plummer crew.

39:59.239 --> 40:02.091
What do you know about her? Anything?

40:02.094 --> 40:03.643
No idea.

40:06.095 --> 40:08.062
Don't make a mistake.

40:09.082 --> 40:11.883
I would take out my
own mother if I had to.

40:11.886 --> 40:14.622
You made promises.

40:14.625 --> 40:18.504
I know. I've kept my end of the deal.

40:18.507 --> 40:20.691
I could've outed Tobias.

40:20.694 --> 40:23.795
- Didn't.
- That's fortunate.

40:29.336 --> 40:34.344
Because if his dirty laundry
comes out, so does yours.

40:58.688 --> 41:00.328
Hey, honey.

41:03.531 --> 41:06.531
Hi.

41:21.788 --> 41:23.020
Dad?
