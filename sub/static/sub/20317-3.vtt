written in foreign?

Have you been shopping
at that fake supermarket again?

00:16.800 --> 00:18.313
Yeah, just 'cause, you know,
we need to save a little bit

00:18.880 --> 00:20.438
of money for the wedding fund.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.113
It still tastes the same.
Doesn't it, Ange?

00:22.200 --> 00:23.349
Sort of.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.794

00:24.920 --> 00:26.035
These are fake Coco Pops!

00:26.680 --> 00:28.238

on the front.

contributing much

00:44.280 --> 00:45.474
to the wedding fund?

00:47.480 --> 00:50.313
MICHE: Er... He hasn't put loads
towards it yet,

00:50.040 --> 00:52.395
but he did contribute
the jar itself

00:52.880 --> 00:55.110
and that's obviously
a massive help.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.039
It's actually his old weed jar

00:57.720 --> 00:59.711
but I've just written
"wedding fund" on it.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.716
So now it looks like
a completely different jar.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.911
You can probably see a few bits
at the bottom still, but...

01:15.280 --> 01:17.874
(GROANS) Oh, I forgot about that.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.515
Another letter
from her royal majesty.

01:19.360 --> 01:20.349
Funny how a moment of madness

01:21.440 --> 01:23.317
can change your life forever,
isn't it?

01:22.800 --> 01:23.915
INTERVIEWER: What's the letter?

01:26.680 --> 01:30.355
Ah... Just... I can't really talk
about it at the moment, mate.

01:27.880 --> 01:28.869
INTERVIEWER: Okay.

01:29.880 --> 01:31.677
But what I will say is...

01:32.880 --> 01:35.678
it's just another bit of trouble
with the law again,

01:37.080 --> 01:39.674

But they can't hold me down.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.754
"Court case pending."

01:42.160 --> 01:43.798
Basically, he got caught
dropping a cigarette

01:45.720 --> 01:47.711
and then he refused
to pay the fine, so...

01:47.640 --> 01:49.358
I mean, what do they expect
people to do?

01:51.200 --> 01:54.272
Walk around with their own
ashtrays or something? I mean...

01:54.920 --> 01:56.831
It's political correctness
gone mad.

No, no, no, it's just a DJ set.

help you to be, like, more creative,

we could have a memorial,

05:09.080 --> 05:11.071

characters in it,

05:42.360 --> 05:43.839
I'm a bit worried
about Craig actually.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.075
Yeah.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.639
Apparently, when you have
a new kid, right...

05:49.880 --> 05:52.553
sometimes, the older kid
feels a bit left out.

05:52.440 --> 05:54.715
Yeah, I've heard about that.
You know what you need to do,

05:55.080 --> 05:57.469
you need to get a piece
of clothing,

05:56.680 --> 05:58.079
a piece of cloth,
from the baby...

05:57.840 --> 05:58.795
Yeah, okay.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.074
...and put the cloth directly under
Craig's nose while he's sleeping,

06:02.800 --> 06:04.836
that way subconsciously
he will not feel threatened

06:05.280 --> 06:07.077

enough actually,

06:23.520 --> 06:25.192

on there as well.

it's gonna go up loads.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.673

having to pay loads more.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.992
