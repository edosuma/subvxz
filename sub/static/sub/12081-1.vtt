00:17.643 --> 00:24.061
Emily, you're now playing
for one million dollars.

00:25.442 --> 00:29.061
Remember you have three minutes to answer

00:29.571 --> 00:33.781
Three minutes that can change your life

00:37.204 --> 00:42.290
Our subject is: "The death penalty".

00:44.795 --> 00:49.210
Which of these substances is used for the lethal medication mix -

00:50.259 --> 00:54.970
- that will cause death within five to ten minutes ?

00:55.764 --> 01:02.557
A: Ringer's lactate 
B: Cefuroxime.

01:03.313 --> 01:10.152
C: Pentothal. 
D: Sodium chloride.

01:11.613 --> 01:16.199
Take your time, Emily.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.898
Wow, she really hit the jackpot tonight didn’t she?

01:24.918 --> 01:25.983
Yep.

01:26.003 --> 01:29.371
A million dollars.
I hope it doesn’t change her.

01:31.633 --> 01:32.999
What’s wrong?

01:33.510 --> 01:35.092
Well has it changed you?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.841
I do not know, you tell me.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.135
You’re commented out.

01:41.476 --> 01:45.586
Right, Governor Pierce has invited you
to Labour Day common in Hampson.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.563
I’m not going anywhere this weekend.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.673
But I booked your flight.

01:49.693 --> 01:53.562
Well send him ten thousand for his campaign
and flowers for his wife.

01:54.031 --> 01:55.429
She likes tulips.

01:55.449 --> 01:58.112
Uh, Jack, he’s expecting you as his guest of honour.

01:58.285 --> 02:01.995
He’s not going to miss me
and send him two cases of that Merlot -

02:02.164 --> 02:05.647
- that I have in my cellar, this
Villa Tirrena, okay?

02:05.667 --> 02:08.000
This Amico wine, he loves this wine.

02:08.669 --> 02:12.505
And you, you have a good weekend, Jean.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.744
Hi, this is Dana,
leave a message and -

03:00.764 --> 03:02.300
- I will get back 
to you as soon as I can.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.342
Hey, it's me.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.885
Just want to hear your voice.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.555
And I love you.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.311
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.914
I’ve got a delivery for Mr. Trammell.

03:29.084 --> 03:31.246
Oh yes. There he is.

03:31.878 --> 03:36.339
Mister Tramell, I’ve got a delivery for you.
Sign here please.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.301
So you are the one who knows all the answers, right?

03:42.055 --> 03:48.250
I bet 100 bucks that you can’t guess
The number of passes completed by

03:48.270 --> 03:50.978
Joe Montana in his career.

03:54.234 --> 04:00.196
Well “Mister Three Minutes" looks like
you owe me 100 bucks.

04:00.574 --> 04:08.574
In his career, Joe Montana -
had 3409 completions, out of 5391 attempts.

04:09.750 --> 04:14.370
He had 273 touchdowns and 139
interceptions and ah

04:15.714 --> 04:20.209
40,551 yards passes.

04:21.762 --> 04:27.224
plus he had 1,676 yards rushes for 20 touchdowns

04:29.686 --> 04:32.520
Come on, I was kidding.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.005
Ah, I don’t play for money.

04:35.025 --> 04:39.426
Hey man, it's Labour Day.
I'm taking my girlfriend out tonight

04:39.446 --> 04:43.565
Well, when you gamble,
You’ve got to be willing to lose.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.768
Here  Robert,
Take your lady out to dinner tonight. Okay?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.324
Thank you, Mister Tramell.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.442
Oh. Mister, Mister Tramell, sorry.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.983
You’re not paid to sleep on the job George,
I’m going to have to report you.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.740
There’s not many here, because
Of Labour Day.

07:36.122 --> 07:38.489
Well if it’s like that, be alert.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.541
I was meditating.

07:41.211 --> 07:43.168
Meditate with your eyes open then.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.987
Maybe I took a few punches too many.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.873
How many fights did you have George?

07:48.593 --> 07:50.533
Seventy in all.

07:50.553 --> 07:54.593
You had 33 amateur fights and you lost your first 
and your last.

07:56.267 --> 07:58.750
Hold on, here’s your mail.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.934
You were kidding about reporting me?

08:05.151 --> 08:08.440
Don’t fall asleep again George, the show’s on tonight.
It’s going to be a good one.

08:08.947 --> 08:11.513
I watch it every week, it’s great show.

08:11.533 --> 08:14.822
Even if a “Playboy Girl” came,
I push her away

08:14.995 --> 08:16.810
I watch your show.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.948
Thank’s Champ. You have a good night.
You too Sir.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.820
Welcome.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.366
You all know the rules, right?
You choose the subject and then we .....

09:03.084 --> 09:05.622
You have three minutes to answer the question.

09:06.129 --> 09:10.669
Three minutes that can change your life

09:31.613 --> 09:33.650
You one of the new owners?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.706
Oh, come on.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.208
You just have to push this...

11:07.292 --> 11:10.285
Jack. Welcome back.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.802
I’m having trouble understanding you.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.725
Are you trying to speak like a Human Being?
It’s normal.

11:34.110 --> 11:40.528
I'm sorry. But I ah, I need you restrained

12:00.803 --> 12:02.089
It's okay.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.789
Who are you? 
Why did you tie me up?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.425
I will fucking kill you!

12:09.604 --> 12:13.223
Well that’s not very nice, Jack.
You know, first you yell at a lady.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.186
Please let’s not forget our manners?

12:22.200 --> 12:26.240
Now promise me you will be good?

12:34.921 --> 12:36.412
So good.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.499
Promise?

12:50.061 --> 12:54.772
Who are you? 
Why did you tie me up?

12:55.650 --> 12:59.143
No, no, no.
Not allowed to ask questions.

12:59.612 --> 13:05.654
Not tonight. Tonight it’s my game show.
Okay?

13:07.245 --> 13:12.661
I know you know the rules. But I've changed them. 
Rule number 1:

13:13.251 --> 13:15.334
1. Switch

13:15.837 --> 13:18.830
We are not playing for money,
we are playing for your life.

13:19.882 --> 13:24.422
Two tries. 
That’s two attempts to answer the same question.

13:25.305 --> 13:30.300
Rule number 2: 
Give me the correct answer and we keep on playing.

13:31.519 --> 13:37.231
Give me the wrong answer –
- and I will be forced to remove a part of your body. Yes?

13:38.192 --> 13:39.808
Three wise men.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.603
But you still have two lifelines.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.659
That’s help from three educated members
of our audience.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.243
Switch.

13:50.955 --> 13:56.149
Ask another question, two tries – 
two attempts to answer the same question.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.752
And ask the audience.

13:58.963 --> 14:03.924
But, apart from all of that,
You must be brave enough -

14:04.469 --> 14:06.506
- to climb to the top.

14:07.013 --> 14:09.721
Oh, come on, Jack, give us a smile?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.427
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.308
The elevator

14:21.152 --> 14:23.986
How does it feel to be the contestant
and not the host?

14:26.949 --> 14:29.362
I guess it isn’t as exciting as you thought.

14:33.289 --> 14:39.035
Never mind, let’s get on with the show.
Are you ready to climb to the top to the top?

14:40.505 --> 14:45.125
Remember that, ladies and gentlemen – only the brave.
Are you feeling brave Jack?

14:46.803 --> 14:49.216
Well, we'll soon find out.

14:53.184 --> 14:57.770
Now, my first question:
What is my occupation?

14:58.856 --> 15:01.644
Am I - A: Unemployed?

15:01.818 --> 15:08.440
B: A sales manager?
C: A teacher? 
D: A hooker?

15:10.868 --> 15:12.734
And we are playing for -

15:16.457 --> 15:18.244
- one of your ears.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.906
Well come on, Jack,
it’s an easy question.

15:26.926 --> 15:27.916
What do you want from me?

15:28.094 --> 15:29.676
That depends how you answer!

15:29.846 --> 15:32.759
Who are you? 
Why did you tie me up?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.383
Answer!

15:35.560 --> 15:37.893
What the Hell is going on here?

15:38.855 --> 15:41.017
May I remind you, that an unanswered question -

15:41.190 --> 15:45.605
- is the same as a wrong answer.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.739
Now answer.

15:52.326 --> 15:56.070
What’s the question again?

15:57.248 --> 16:02.150
Am I - A: Unemployed?
B: A sales manager?

16:02.170 --> 16:05.584
C: A teacher? 
D: A hooker?

16:08.676 --> 16:12.966
I don’t know.
You don’t look unemployed.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.292
And you are well dressed

16:19.312 --> 16:23.773
Ah. Very focused. Come on.

16:24.484 --> 16:29.354
Ah it's Labour Day -

16:30.573 --> 16:36.160
- and if you were a sales manager, 
you would be in the store.

16:36.329 --> 16:42.451
And I,
I don’t sleep with hookers. So...

16:48.257 --> 16:49.873
I say teacher.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.676
Is that your final answer?

16:59.268 --> 17:01.100
I, I...

17:04.690 --> 17:07.272
stuttering are we, Jack?

17:10.445 --> 17:13.984
Do you know? I'll take that as a "yes".

17:17.244 --> 17:25.244
Ladies and gentlemen, I asked Jack -
"What is my occupation?”

17:27.213 --> 17:29.956
And he answered - "teacher".

17:32.134 --> 17:34.217
And the correct answer is:

17:36.931 --> 17:38.547
A teacher.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.393
Congratulations.

17:45.064 --> 17:51.277
You know, we should celebrate your first
correct answer, with a bottle of wine.

17:51.779 --> 17:57.992
A bottle of Villa Tirrena, right? 
Villa Tirrena, is that your favorite wine? 100% Merlot?

17:59.704 --> 18:04.540
If we ever get out of here alive,
we should have a glass. Right Jack?

18:06.669 --> 18:09.377
A teacher. Absolutely amazing.

18:11.507 --> 18:12.918
Teacher.

18:14.010 --> 18:19.078
You are probably one of those people who think
that teaching isn’t a real job.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.933
And you are one of those people who think that 
you got to where you are -

18:23.102 --> 18:26.595
- thanks to your own unique talent..

18:29.108 --> 18:31.851
Well that's bullshit, Jack.

18:32.737 --> 18:39.359
You are who you are, thanks to people like me. 
We teachers, we raise you , we educate you

18:39.535 --> 18:43.199
From childhood to adolescence
We teach you right from wrong.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.161
But in your case, 
it was obviously a waste of time.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.507
Yes. I remember.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.671
You’re crazy.

19:54.276 --> 20:00.648
Do you remember it Jack?
It's really simple.

20:04.161 --> 20:07.074
Your teacher would have been disappointed 
if you had forgotten that, hmm

20:09.834 --> 20:11.370
Can you sing it?

20:13.045 --> 20:14.536
Sing it.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.210
Sing.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.752
Show me that your teacher didn’t waste her time on you.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.508
That was very good. Very good.

21:11.228 --> 21:12.594
Let’s get on with the game.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.857
We’re going to play for your toenail.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.947
Question number 2, 
a movie question.

21:26.744 --> 21:30.829
Which is the odd movie out?

21:31.373 --> 21:34.866
A: Misery?

21:36.128 --> 21:42.500
B: Diabolique? 1953 French version of course.

21:42.676 --> 21:49.048
C: Kill Bill. 
D: Million Dollar Baby.

21:51.977 --> 21:58.269
Think it over.
You can always ask for help.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.022
I...

22:09.537 --> 22:11.779
I can’t hear you, Jack.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.200
Why are you doing this to me?

22:18.420 --> 22:20.127
It’s not a request?

22:20.798 --> 22:23.916
No answer is the same as a wrong answer.

22:25.302 --> 22:29.137
Either way you lose a nail.
Those are the rules of the game.

22:30.641 --> 22:32.633
This is not a game.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.193
Answer!

22:48.742 --> 22:50.734
I have no idea.
Answer!

22:52.079 --> 22:53.035
Damn shit!

23:03.966 --> 23:07.425
Oh my God! No...

23:08.220 --> 23:14.057
No, no... Oh my God...

23:15.769 --> 23:17.351
No!

23:20.024 --> 23:21.515
That’s what happens. See?

23:22.526 --> 23:23.812
Oh my God.

23:28.616 --> 23:30.681
I hope this will make you consider -

23:30.701 --> 23:33.068
the consequences of the questions.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.119
Now, I’m going to ask the question again –

23:39.376 --> 23:44.292
- and we are going to play for the nail,
of your other big toe.

23:47.801 --> 23:52.216
Question # 2: 
Which is the odd movie out?

23:52.890 --> 23:58.978
Is it A: Misery 
B: Diabolique

23:59.980 --> 24:05.647
C: Kill Bill 
or D: Million Dollar Baby?

24:06.236 --> 24:09.229
Oh, you are insane, fuck you.

24:10.407 --> 24:11.943
Ah, maybe I am.

24:13.911 --> 24:17.450
Maybe I’m, I was the nurse in this operation

24:18.123 --> 24:19.534
Either way,

24:22.962 --> 24:24.874
you should realise.

24:31.470 --> 24:36.465
Come on, Jack. 
You certainly know the answer.

24:38.018 --> 24:43.104
I mean, a man with your knowledge of films.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.893
You have the biggest DVD collection I have ever seen.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.320
You’ve ever seen?

24:51.824 --> 24:56.865
Yeah sure, 
Oh, I will have to give you back "The Big Lebowsky".

24:57.621 --> 24:59.283
You were in my apartment?

25:01.417 --> 25:02.908
Answer!

25:03.460 --> 25:04.667
Wait!

25:05.963 --> 25:07.249
Okay.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.499
Okay.

25:15.431 --> 25:19.971
All four movies
have female protagonists.

25:21.687 --> 25:25.806
"Misery" is a horror film.

25:26.650 --> 25:31.486
"Diabolique" and "Kill Bill"
are revenge dramas.

25:33.907 --> 25:38.652
"Million Dollar Baby" 
is a sports drama.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.662
That's interesting.

25:42.583 --> 25:50.583
But it’s not, not the genre, 
No. No.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.132
No, it’s the women.

26:01.143 --> 26:04.307
You know they're all crazy. Yes?

26:05.647 --> 26:07.604
Is that so?

26:10.152 --> 26:14.237
Wait. Wait.

26:16.158 --> 26:19.617
"Misery" and "Diabolique"
are too obvious.

26:20.454 --> 26:27.497
"Kill Bill" is a, maybe some sick joke
Directed at me –

26:27.669 --> 26:32.289
- but I still, 
I still don’t know what the fuck you want!

26:33.550 --> 26:35.633
Or what you’re fighting for.

26:37.930 --> 26:43.267
But I do know that if you wanted to kill me
You would have done it by now, so...

26:45.229 --> 26:47.391
- maybe it’s about the money.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.311
Is it the money?

26:56.865 --> 26:59.152
It's "Million Dollar Baby".

27:01.161 --> 27:02.368
Yes.

27:13.173 --> 27:15.335
Is that your final answer?

27:15.968 --> 27:20.588
Yes! 
Yes, You bitch!

27:25.894 --> 27:29.683
Congratulations, Jack
You’re really good at this.

27:38.157 --> 27:39.489
God!

27:42.744 --> 27:44.451
Why?

27:45.581 --> 27:48.540
Because although you got the question right....

27:49.251 --> 27:52.289
- I am not for sale.

28:03.724 --> 28:06.307
What is that? What are gonna’ do?

28:07.603 --> 28:09.390
Do you think it’s poison?

28:14.276 --> 28:17.235
You know, it might be,
That’s why ...

28:19.114 --> 28:21.447
- I'm dying to find out .

28:30.959 --> 28:34.123
Morphine kick starts.

28:36.673 --> 28:39.165
Lower it now.

28:39.343 --> 28:40.834
Take it easy.

28:42.262 --> 28:44.595
Soon there will be no more pain.

28:54.608 --> 29:02.402
So, what do we actually know about you Jack?

29:03.867 --> 29:07.736
Apart from your massive DVD collection.

29:09.289 --> 29:11.531
You have a mansion in Malibu.

29:13.460 --> 29:18.831
Oh that mountain has seen some wild parties. 
Right, Jack?

29:19.716 --> 29:21.673
You're quite a party animal.

29:26.556 --> 29:31.802
What can you tell me about Anna?

29:34.523 --> 29:35.684
Who?

29:36.275 --> 29:42.772
Not who? but what you did.

29:43.532 --> 29:45.239
I didn’t do anything.

29:47.744 --> 29:53.035
Anna Sakowsky? A beautiful, young Polish girl.

29:54.167 --> 30:00.755
It happened during one of your wild parties
The night something went wrong.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.052
Yeah. Yeah.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.390
I remember it.

30:12.936 --> 30:20.936
Sure you do. 
Blonde, hot and ready for anything and everything.....

30:21.570 --> 30:27.612
- for her 15 minutes of fame.
But that night she went too far.

30:30.162 --> 30:35.981
Had I known she was getting so much coke,
I would have stopped them.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.708
But you didn’t.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.290
No, I didn’t.

30:42.466 --> 30:45.800
She locked herself in the bathroom 

30:49.097 --> 30:50.463
Some guy... 

30:50.766 --> 30:57.855
broke the door down. 
Too late 

31:00.400 --> 31:02.733
I didn’t know
She had used so much coke

31:03.111 --> 31:05.819
And you saw her dying?

31:06.948 --> 31:08.280
Was not my fault.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.442
Why didn’t you call an ambulance?

31:11.078 --> 31:12.819
It was not my fault.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.741
Why did you dump her outside
as though she was a dying dog?

31:18.335 --> 31:23.706
You could have called a doctor.
You could have saved her life. 
Why?

31:29.346 --> 31:31.178
Because I was a coward.

31:34.643 --> 31:40.014
I was more worried about my....

31:43.276 --> 31:44.812
- my career.

31:49.199 --> 31:56.868
And between your career and her life,
you chose your career.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.707
Can I have some more morphine?

32:33.743 --> 32:39.205
It’s not time to relieve pain,
it's time to suffer.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.161
Why are you doing this to me?

32:41.835 --> 32:45.124
Naloxone, it blocks the opioid receptors

32:47.549 --> 32:49.836
I need you to be alert.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.210
Why are you doing this to me?

32:53.930 --> 32:57.094
Because it's my game and I make the rules.

32:59.186 --> 33:01.428
Tell me how much you want to let me go?

33:01.980 --> 33:05.018
I told you, I'm not for sale.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.605
Everybody has a price.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.562
You do too.

33:14.034 --> 33:17.698
You know, you’re right, I do.

33:19.289 --> 33:21.451
Why don’t you tell me what it is?

33:21.625 --> 33:23.912
Oh, you tell me.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.744
Maybe I will.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.749
My wallet’s in my jacket.

33:32.302 --> 33:35.795
Well, I've have a better idea.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.476
What are you doing?

33:44.689 --> 33:48.273
PW-bank, right? You have a bank account number?

33:48.902 --> 33:50.609
Tell me how much you want.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.817
Bank account number please.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.368
Bank account!

34:01.957 --> 34:04.040
Account number.

34:05.627 --> 34:08.620
Four, four, nine, nine,

34:10.340 --> 34:13.799
nine, nine, four.
Okay, nine, four...

34:13.969 --> 34:18.679
J, P, six, five, five, six.

34:19.139 --> 34:23.554
Six, five, five, six. 
Password?

34:29.818 --> 34:31.059
Hello?

34:32.571 --> 34:34.152
I can’t remember.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.069
Oh Come on Jack, make a little effort.

34:39.244 --> 34:44.034
How can I remember a password
if you have been torturing me?

34:46.251 --> 34:47.958
Then you are not going to help me?

34:51.422 --> 34:53.210
Hmm, where were my forceps pliers?

34:54.759 --> 34:58.423
In my phone. 
The password is in my phone.

34:58.930 --> 35:01.013
Oh, and where do I seek?

35:03.101 --> 35:04.808
Find it yourself

35:05.478 --> 35:07.310
Righto.

35:08.815 --> 35:13.276
Oh my God, 
You have a lot of celebrities here.

35:17.741 --> 35:19.653
I love her.

35:21.995 --> 35:23.657
Let’s send her a message.

35:24.748 --> 35:29.334
Keep up the good work.

35:30.170 --> 35:38.170
Oh, and no, you do not have a fat ass,

35:42.349 --> 35:43.931
Oops, I pressed send.

35:48.438 --> 35:50.976
Pick, ivy, Northby.
What?

35:51.650 --> 35:55.860
Pick, ivy, Northby.

36:02.035 --> 36:07.872
Oh you’re smart. Pick in bank. 

36:15.632 --> 36:18.670
Oh baby, you are rich.

36:25.558 --> 36:29.893
Do you believe in the Declaration of Independence? 
Because I do.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.560
Especially the bit about the pursuit of happiness.

36:33.733 --> 36:34.974
What’s wrong?

36:37.570 --> 36:39.719
Shouldn’t we call the emergency elevator number?

36:39.739 --> 36:41.105
Nah...

36:43.952 --> 36:46.035
Two million dollars.

36:48.498 --> 36:50.285
Who did you give my money to?

36:50.458 --> 36:52.245
Trust me, to a good cause.

36:52.794 --> 36:55.377
If you get out of here alive then you’ll find out.

36:58.508 --> 37:01.626
Hello? Anyone in there?

37:02.595 --> 37:03.802
Hello?

37:04.264 --> 37:06.506
Don’t say a word.

37:08.143 --> 37:09.475
No, baby.

37:21.614 --> 37:23.150
I'm serious.

37:48.349 --> 37:49.681
Shut up!

37:53.855 --> 37:55.437
Serves you right!

38:20.131 --> 38:23.624
Jack, who do you think you are, sending me messages like that?
Are you crazy?

38:23.802 --> 38:25.366
Rachel! Rachel! Help me!

38:25.386 --> 38:27.924
What? Are you sending more?
?

38:28.097 --> 38:29.463
I'm trapped! Rachel!

38:29.641 --> 38:32.258
You creep! I've had it with you!

38:32.435 --> 38:35.678
Stay away from me

38:35.855 --> 38:38.017
If you call me one more time then I will report you.
I will report you for harassment.

38:40.777 --> 38:42.985
Jack! Jack!

39:50.346 --> 39:52.328
And you picked the right answer. Well done!

39:52.348 --> 39:53.429
Yes!

40:09.616 --> 40:11.778
Now you can go to hell!

40:18.249 --> 40:19.956
Well, well, well!

40:24.672 --> 40:26.208
Damn asshole.

40:35.099 --> 40:40.060
For the next question I will be back in a couple of minutes. 
Stay tuned.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.061
I told you, there's someone in there.

40:54.619 --> 40:58.579
How come the alarm turned off?
Somebody must have pushed it.

41:02.585 --> 41:08.172
Hello! Is anyone there? If you are stuck, jump hard.

41:12.428 --> 41:13.669
Oh my God.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.799
It’s a cell phone ringing
Somebody’s in there.

41:20.144 --> 41:23.603
Hey! Can we get some help in there?

41:26.025 --> 41:29.109
Are you alright? Hello!

41:44.836 --> 41:47.249
I told you, it’s bad wiring, 
it happens all the time.

41:47.422 --> 41:49.129
I’ll go downstairs and get George.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.342
It’s working.

41:54.470 --> 41:59.306
Hey Sarah. Come back,
It’s working. Sarah!

42:01.686 --> 42:03.268
Bad wiring.

42:06.858 --> 42:09.066
There you go, a cell phone.

42:14.365 --> 42:18.109
It’s Jack Tramell.
It must be his cell phone.

42:19.871 --> 42:22.770
Jack Tramell? Is that the guy from the quiz show?
Yes.

42:22.790 --> 42:26.283
Fuck you Tramell. 
Knowing the answers doesn’t make you a big shot

42:26.461 --> 42:28.703
What are you talking about?
It’s a quiz game...

42:28.880 --> 42:33.341
he has to know all the answers.
Besides, he’s really good at it.

42:33.676 --> 42:38.216
Yeah. I would be just as good as he is 
if they gave me all that money.

42:39.098 --> 42:44.719
You are an idiot. 
I'm taking it down to George in Security.

42:44.937 --> 42:49.056
I wouldn’t take the elevator. I’ll see you downstairs baby
I'll go get a cab.

42:49.233 --> 42:49.973
Okay.

42:52.028 --> 42:53.018
Okay.

42:57.492 --> 43:03.363
Which US President was born with the name -
Leslie King Junior?

43:12.590 --> 43:18.177
A: Bill Clinton? 
B: Gerald Ford?
Hello George.

43:19.347 --> 43:22.636
I found Jack Tramell’s phone.
Oh. He’ll appreciate this.

43:22.809 --> 43:25.017
- Good night.
- Good Night.

43:28.940 --> 43:30.681
I’m never going to get the answer....

43:33.820 --> 43:35.482
I’ll go for the switch.

43:39.659 --> 43:41.321
Are you sure?

43:44.038 --> 43:45.154
Yes.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.743
Okay then. Switch!

44:21.576 --> 44:23.363
Ah, that hurts.

44:25.496 --> 44:27.362
Can I have some more morphine please?

44:27.999 --> 44:29.285
No.

44:34.463 --> 44:37.530
You’re fucked.
Shut up.

44:37.550 --> 44:40.793
She’s got my phone.
Somebody’s gonna’ come.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.963
Well, I'll just have to deal with them.

44:44.849 --> 44:48.308
If you want to kill me,
Get it over with.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.846
I just want to know why you are doing this to me.

44:52.356 --> 44:54.018
Why I’m doing this to you?

44:55.610 --> 44:58.426
Ah, well that’s the next question Jack....

44:58.446 --> 45:01.655
- welcome back to the elevator,
why am I doing this to you?

45:02.950 --> 45:06.443
Is it A: Justice 
B: Insanity

45:07.330 --> 45:10.823
C: Revenge 
D: love?

45:12.251 --> 45:17.246
And we are playing for one of your eyes.

45:22.345 --> 45:24.462
Do you want me to repeat the question?

45:26.265 --> 45:30.680
Whatever answer I give you,
Then it’ll hurt me.

45:33.731 --> 45:36.314
You’re going to use it as a pretence to torture me.

45:39.779 --> 45:44.774
You’re a sadist. 
What are all these questions?

45:45.868 --> 45:48.656
Answer my questions and you’ll find out.

45:50.790 --> 45:55.205
Justice would mean - someone has wronged you.

45:57.380 --> 46:02.216
But I still don’t know why I have to pay for it.
Is it about Anna?

46:03.386 --> 46:07.005
Are you doing this.
Are you doing this for Anna?

46:08.766 --> 46:10.974
Anna's your problem, not mine.

46:15.439 --> 46:22.187
You call this justice, but it’s sheer evil.

46:24.073 --> 46:32.038
And you're not insane,
and in no way is this about love.

46:34.333 --> 46:39.704
Because love would never motivate this kind of torture.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.542
Is that your answer?

46:44.218 --> 46:46.210
So I’m left with revenge.

46:46.387 --> 46:47.628
Is that your answer?

46:48.097 --> 46:51.010
What have I done to you? 

46:52.143 --> 46:56.419
God!
What are you blaming me for?

46:56.439 --> 46:58.431
I am waiting for you to confirm your answer

47:01.485 --> 47:08.139
Revenge.
My answer is revenge.

47:08.159 --> 47:10.071
Is that your final answer?

47:15.041 --> 47:16.828
Somebody is coming.

47:23.716 --> 47:28.928
Well done Jack. You’ve got guts.

47:35.019 --> 47:36.226
Revenge?

47:38.522 --> 47:40.184
Why revenge?

47:43.277 --> 47:47.317
I still, I don’t know what they’ve done to you

47:47.490 --> 47:49.698
What they’ve done?

47:49.867 --> 47:55.079
Yes, they, them, not me.

47:56.040 --> 47:59.829
You're looking for some kind of justice 
and you’re seeking it for revenge 
but there is a difference...

48:00.002 --> 48:04.542
- between the two of them and you can’t see it.

48:05.174 --> 48:10.215
No. Actually there is no difference
You’ve never read the Bible?

48:12.515 --> 48:17.101
The "Lex Talionis"? 
The law of like for like.

48:17.645 --> 48:22.561
When a serious injury is committed,
You are to take a life for life,

48:22.733 --> 48:25.851
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

48:28.614 --> 48:31.573
So now you know, revenge has brought me here.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.071
We get to the next question....

48:35.162 --> 48:38.326
- which is - What have you done to deserve this?

48:40.042 --> 48:44.193
A: Lies 
B: Steal

48:44.213 --> 48:49.459
C: Corruption 
D: Murder?

48:49.635 --> 48:54.203
I don’t know what you're talking about.
I have never done any of those things!

48:54.223 --> 48:56.590
Jack! Answer!

48:56.851 --> 49:00.793
I can’t! 
Enough! 
Stop!

49:00.813 --> 49:03.087
I can’t answer for something I've never done!

49:03.107 --> 49:05.565
You owe me an answer!

49:05.734 --> 49:07.191
I owe you nothing!

49:07.361 --> 49:11.554
A: Steal 
B: Lies

49:11.574 --> 49:14.487
C: Corruption 
D: Murder?

49:14.660 --> 49:15.821
I’ve never done any of those things.

49:15.995 --> 49:21.741
Steal, lies, corruption or murder? 
Answer, answer me!

49:22.668 --> 49:25.877
Lies corruption or murder!
You know what you did!

49:26.046 --> 49:28.379
You know what you did.

49:36.932 --> 49:39.675
You killed my son.

49:45.649 --> 49:48.062
You killed him.

50:04.126 --> 50:07.776
You killed him.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.378
You’re making a terrible mistake.

50:12.593 --> 50:16.303
I didn’t kill anyone. Never.

50:17.932 --> 50:19.798
I don’t even know your son.

50:20.935 --> 50:22.642
How could I have killed him?

50:26.315 --> 50:30.901
You gave away all my money, and you tortured me.
For nothing.

50:33.614 --> 50:36.072
If I had done the things that you said, 
I would have confessed!

50:38.244 --> 50:41.078
Nobody can stand this!

50:43.791 --> 50:50.755
Please, let me go.

50:52.716 --> 50:57.632
You won’t regret it.
For the rest of your life.

51:03.394 --> 51:07.058
You don’t know how it feels to have a child.

51:09.567 --> 51:12.275
It’s an indescribable feeling, Jack.

51:13.529 --> 51:20.766
You feel needed,
and you realise....

51:20.786 --> 51:22.948
what your role in life is

51:24.081 --> 51:27.825
To hold him, to raise him, protect him.

51:34.258 --> 51:40.880
And every step he takes, you’re one step behind....

51:42.391 --> 51:46.226
- always behind.

51:48.355 --> 51:50.472
He’s always on your mind.

51:56.113 --> 52:03.031
Then one day you realise something is not right ...

52:04.246 --> 52:08.160
- and it’s him. He’s missing his father.

52:10.544 --> 52:16.290
And he starts asking why Mommy isn’t with Daddy anymore

52:18.761 --> 52:22.129
And you tell him the truth, you tell him...

52:23.974 --> 52:31.346
- that Mommy met Daddy in Brazil 
and that you had a love affair, but it was not to be

52:32.524 --> 52:40.148
But he was meant to be. Christopher.

52:42.326 --> 52:46.991
He was meant to be.

52:58.884 --> 53:05.176
But with his curiosity, 
he needs to give his father a face.

53:11.939 --> 53:19.062
So, you contact his father 
and go to Brazil with him ...

53:19.279 --> 53:21.316
- to meet him.

53:24.201 --> 53:30.949
It’s only a short trip you think
though you can’t be sure

53:34.294 --> 53:37.287
But you persuade yourself it’s for the best

53:40.718 --> 53:47.788
And then you come home, but the requests keep coming

53:47.808 --> 53:55.808
The trips, vacations, 
and then he is 17 and can travel himself

54:01.405 --> 54:03.818
But he never comes back.

54:07.327 --> 54:12.493
You call his father, the police, the embassy.

54:18.881 --> 54:22.921
But he simply disappears 

54:27.347 --> 54:34.220
And then in the middle of the night,
You get that call.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.266
He’s been found.

54:41.653 --> 54:45.738
In a ditch. Kidnapped.

54:46.700 --> 54:53.914
Killed. With his kidneys torn out.

55:03.342 --> 55:09.930
When these things happen to a mother,
All you’re left with is pain...

55:13.101 --> 55:19.814
- and tears and photographs

55:22.736 --> 55:25.399
But a mother has a right to know

55:28.742 --> 55:31.701
So I looked for the truth.

55:33.914 --> 55:35.701
And I found it.

55:39.753 --> 55:45.966
Human organ trafficking.

55:49.680 --> 55:54.300
What are you talking about?
What have I got to do with it?

55:58.564 --> 56:00.977
You know what it has to do with you.

56:02.150 --> 56:07.487
You are making a mistake.
You are making a terrible mistake.

56:08.198 --> 56:11.691
I have nothing to do with this.
You must believe me.

56:12.870 --> 56:14.827
You are making a terrible mistake.

56:17.291 --> 56:20.455
I've searched for you.
No.

56:21.253 --> 56:26.794
For the past three years. This is not an error.

56:27.342 --> 56:28.924
This is not a mistake.

56:57.080 --> 56:58.287
What the fuck...

57:27.778 --> 57:30.737
George! George!

57:31.949 --> 57:36.614
George! Wake up!

57:49.257 --> 57:52.796
What the fuck are doin up there?
[Indistinct reply]

57:53.345 --> 57:56.133
I came with your telephone,
I bring it back to you.

57:56.306 --> 58:01.333
[indistinct] 
George, come here!

58:01.353 --> 58:02.935
[indistinct]

58:06.858 --> 58:08.645
What took you so long?

58:08.819 --> 58:11.677
Jesus Christ! What’s going on?

58:11.697 --> 58:14.235
There’s a woman 
She’s trying to kill me.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.274
What you do to her?

58:17.035 --> 58:18.651
I didn’t do anything.

58:19.079 --> 58:21.186
Listen, she is going to be back in a minute.

58:21.206 --> 58:23.914
Okay, so we got to try and get the Hell out of here.
Okay?

58:26.670 --> 58:29.987
You got to help me undo the belt 
try and get my hands free, okay?

58:30.007 --> 58:31.196
Okay.

58:31.216 --> 58:33.281
Okay, come here. Come this way.

58:33.301 --> 58:36.385
Yes. Okay. Yes.

58:39.641 --> 58:41.132
You gotta’ find the belt?

58:41.309 --> 58:43.500
Find it? You got the belt?

58:43.520 --> 58:44.886
Hold still.

58:46.481 --> 58:47.688
Yes, got it.

58:49.901 --> 58:52.063
Good job George. Okay.

58:58.618 --> 58:59.904
She’s coming back.

59:01.747 --> 59:02.863
Jesus Christ.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.281
You still have two minutes left.

59:06.543 --> 59:07.829
Hold on George.

59:16.762 --> 59:18.298
I’m gonna’ go for help.

59:18.472 --> 59:19.804
Don’t forget me.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.596
Lady, that’s loaded.

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:07.430
You having fun up there Jack?

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.687
Come on down, Jack.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:13.524
Jack!

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.989
If you don’t come down, 
I will be forced to kill him.

01:00:29.376 --> 01:00:32.164
He doesn’t look like he would be 
too happy to die for you.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.628
Jack, get the fuck down here.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.873
Did you hear that?

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.876
Now I count.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:48.094
One, two, three.

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.646
Say good-bye to your friend, Jack.

01:00:54.693 --> 01:00:56.633
You won’t kill him.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.110
Excuse me?

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.815
It’s me you want.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:09.906
And if you want me
you’re gonna’ have to come up here.

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm not coming down.
I am not guilty.

01:01:21.761 --> 01:01:24.799
If you want to kill me,
you’re gonna’ have to come up here and get me!

01:01:27.559 --> 01:01:29.175
I am innocent!

01:01:34.649 --> 01:01:37.107
All I want is to give me a chance to prove it.

01:01:38.445 --> 01:01:41.108
My son wasn’t given a chance.

01:01:44.409 --> 01:01:49.621
I had nothing to do with your son’s death.

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:03.843
You know, it doesn’t take this elevator very long
to get to the top.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.422
Any idea what’s at the end?

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:15.518
No. You don’t think ahead do you Jack? 
You don’t worry about the consequences.

01:02:16.233 --> 01:02:18.270
Well, you looking up?

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:25.722
See the clean shining thing,
Well, that’s not a light...

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.904
- It’s a bumper.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:32.822
And the elevator only stops when
It hits that bumper

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:35.787
Otherwise known as “The end of the road.”

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.662
So, if that's your final answer...

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.491
stop!
Just a few seconds.

01:02:44.511 --> 01:02:47.720
Stop, I'm coming down!

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:49.388
And the show will be over.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:08.987
Jack?

01:03:16.251 --> 01:03:18.208
You can come down now.

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:23.296
It’ll take me a minute.

01:03:24.301 --> 01:03:25.917
Take your time.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:47.567
Down you come.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:39.245
I am fed up with you fucking with me!
Now we have two questions left.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:41.107
Enough of this game.

01:04:41.127 --> 01:04:43.369
The question for which we are getting your lying tongue. If...

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:53.673
Which of the following countries
is notorious for human organ trafficking?

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:58.666
Is it A: Italy 
B: Brazil

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:01.349
C: Canada 
D: Australia?

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:03.435
I have no idea what you are talking about.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:08.385
Oh, come on Jack, this one should be easy.
You’ve been there, right?

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:12.945
You do not want the truth. You want your truth
I can’t give it to you.

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:18.204
Don’t you get it?
I’m giving you the chance to repent.

01:05:18.873 --> 01:05:21.456
But first you gotta’ confess

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:38.098
Hah, why don’t we ask our audience for help?

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:47.980
Excuse me sir, Our contestant is having difficulties
answering the question.

01:05:48.653 --> 01:05:53.523
He’s in danger of losing his tongue.
Would you like to step up and help him?

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:07.788
I warn you, if you do anything stupid again...

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:10.627
- I will be forced to kill you.

01:06:19.851 --> 01:06:21.763
Now I repeat the question.

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:26.727
Which country is notorious
for human organ trafficking?

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:32.862
Forget about it George. Anything you tell her
she’s going to kill me.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.656
You’re not allowed to talk to the audience.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:39.944
Why are you doing this, lady?

01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:43.952
She thinks I'm responsible
for her son’s death.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:53.132
Oh no, no, I know Mr Tramell many years.

01:06:54.052 --> 01:07:01.016
He wouldn’t hurt anybody. He’s a saint really.
This must be a mistake.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:10.632
You know I am so touched 
by your description of Mr Tramell...

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:15.443
- but I am still waiting for
the answer to the question.

01:07:18.326 --> 01:07:19.533
Brazil.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:24.196
Brazil. I saw a documentary.... 

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:29.836
- about human organ trafficking,
and it mentioned Brazil.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:40.212
Okay, Brazil.

01:07:41.808 --> 01:07:45.552
You know I had a feeling that you 
already knew the answer.

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:53.101
But that is correct. Brazil.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:06.907
Now I warn you, one false move 
and I will be forced to shoot you.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:13.041
Okay? Now get up. 
Let’s Go.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:35.049
Well, that was really quick so we won’t waste any time
and we will get straight to the answer....

01:08:35.069 --> 01:08:36.651
- which is...

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:39.520
B!

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:04.470
Well we’ve reached the end of the game Jack
guess what we are playing for now?

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:08.559
I don’t give a shit.
Just kill me and get it over with.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:14.474
You know I've set a price. 
We are playing for my son’s kidney.

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:17.475
I don’t have it.

01:09:17.987 --> 01:09:22.197
You’re a good actor – I’ll give you that. 
What’s you height?

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.276
5’ 11”.
Weight?

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:28.946
Hundred and sixty pounds.
Blood type?

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:32.412
“0” negative.
‘You allergic to penicillin?

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.372
Yes I am and so what?

01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:36.252
Then it is you.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:44.879
What makes you so sure I am responsible 
for your son’s death?

01:09:45.055 --> 01:09:48.424
Believe me, I’ve been meticulous 
in my research.

01:09:51.729 --> 01:09:53.265
It’s not me.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:10:01.863
When they told me that my son
was found dead lying in a ditch

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:05.782
like a dog...

01:10:07.578 --> 01:10:13.040
- I wanted to die. 
But your perspective changes 
when you are faced with death.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:18.861
I knew I couldn’t die.
until I knew the truth.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:23.376
So, I started piecing the story together

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:35.221
We went to the embassy.
Do you know what they said?

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:40.234
Things like this happen every day Jack.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.697
Shit happens
every day in Brazil.

01:10:48.995 --> 01:10:50.827
There was nothing we could do.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:59.917
I went to the police every day,
and asked questions.

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:06.507
And then one day, a policewoman
took pity on me. Pilar.

01:11:10.057 --> 01:11:17.601
She gave me the name of a suspected
intermediary in the organ trade.

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.936
Jorge Curado.

01:11:22.153 --> 01:11:27.023
Only a name - but I found him.

01:11:31.913 --> 01:11:34.371
I pretended to be a journalist...

01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:37.283
- and offered him 5,000 dollars for an interview.

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:44.131
He was proud of what he did.
He saw himself as a benefactor.

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.842
Helping the poor sell their kidneys...

01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:52.761
to the sick who needed one.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:59.337
Eighty percent of the world’s organs are illegal...

01:11:59.357 --> 01:12:04.978
which makes for a vast, unregulated, illegal trade...

01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:12.527
Based on greed. 
Greed of the doctors and organ traffickers...

01:12:12.703 --> 01:12:15.195
and the needs of the sick.

01:12:18.501 --> 01:12:23.121
I asked him about the American teenager
Who had been found dead...

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:29.422
and he played dumb until
I put a gun to his head.

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:34.261
He said he was so sorry...

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:43.979
but an organ was needed – fresh and clean...

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:49.028
for some big shot in the States.

01:12:52.493 --> 01:12:54.485
It was a lot of money.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:13:01.163
And the payment came from the States,
but they didn’t know from whom.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:06.334
And then you killed him.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.180
Why do you care? 
Do you miss him?

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:20.428
And you think –
That I’m the rich American.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.180
I know you are.

01:13:23.357 --> 01:13:24.643
How?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:31.345
It gets better.
I found the surgeon.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:34.529
A doctor Emhet Erguld - from Istanbul.

01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:41.620
He’s an expert in his field.
So I went to Istanbul.

01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:49.753
I don’t know his name, they never tell me.
I told you..

01:13:50.885 --> 01:13:53.423
Please let me go
I beg you.

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:58.132
I remember that he was
American show host on television.

01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:01.181
I don’t know this man.
He didn’t tell you my name.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:04.305
No, but he gave me the hospital records.

01:14:04.482 --> 01:14:07.475
And from the patient’s profile you 
have decided it was me?

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.689
I know it’s you.

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:13.359
Do you have any idea how many people 
in the entertainment industry...

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:17.224
fit that profile?
Thirty-nine. I checked.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:18.576
You’re wrong!

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:25.917
Do you want more evidence?
What about this?

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:31.081
You want to kill me because
Of a scar?

01:14:32.426 --> 01:14:39.014
That’s not just any scar.
That scar covers my son’s kidney...

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.467
and I want it back.

01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:44.386
There’s nothing behind that scar.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.981
I never received a kidney,
I donated one.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:50.107
Don’t you dare lie to me!

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:54.275
You say I don’t know what it’s like
to be a mother?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:57.612
But I know what it’s like to get that call.

01:15:00.329 --> 01:15:05.120
It was just a little lake. Thanksgiving.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:13.382
Do you know what happens when a
truck hits a car doing 100 mph?

01:15:14.719 --> 01:15:21.558
The windows blow out,
and the tires, they actually explode.

01:15:22.101 --> 01:15:26.252
Did you know that? And the driver
Gets shot through the windshield ...

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:27.683
like a rock.

01:15:30.609 --> 01:15:33.067
My sister was 25.

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:42.780
Yeah, the doctors managed to save her
but her kidneys were destroyed.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:46.449
And I was a match...

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.419
and it was a fucking miracle!

01:15:59.889 --> 01:16:02.051
I saved her life.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:09.471
I'm so sorry about your son...

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:13.479
but I couldn’t do it.

01:16:17.448 --> 01:16:19.064
I'm not the one.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:29.826
And I'm so sorry - Jack
My investigation is complete...

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:33.194
you are the one.

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:37.333
I'm not. I can prove it.
You check the Internet.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:42.505
You check Dana Tramell - Car accident.

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:45.465
I know the truth.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:50.183
Just check. What difference does it make?

01:17:05.704 --> 01:17:10.449
Check “Dana Tramell.”
Check “Car accident.”

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.669
Fatal car accident.

01:17:17.925 --> 01:17:20.212
There’s no mention of a transplant.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.675
I kept it quiet,
I didn’t want it to get into the news.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.165
That's a lie.
Call Doctor Hibbert.

01:17:28.185 --> 01:17:30.918
You're lying.
He was the surgeon who performed the transplant...

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:34.932
his number is in my phone.
Call him. Ask him.

01:17:37.194 --> 01:17:39.151
I have a better idea.

01:17:42.324 --> 01:17:44.236
Why don’t I call your sister.

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:46.818
She won’t answer.

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.906
Hi, this is Dana. Leave a message... 

01:18:00.926 --> 01:18:02.658
and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.410
I told you...

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.745
If you want your brother to live,
call back.

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:08.497
Call Dr. Hibbert 

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.976
He will explain to you that I had
nothing to do with your son.

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:20.060
She won’t call back.

01:18:21.906 --> 01:18:26.776
She's dead,
and the scars all I’ve got...

01:18:27.328 --> 01:18:33.620
Six months after her operation
she got sick. Her body couldn’t take it.

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:37.330
She died two years later.

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:39.996
Why does she have an
answering machine if she’s dead?

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:46.385
You, of all people, should understand...

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:50.139
what it’s like to lose somebody you love.

01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:56.973
I kept her answering service 
because just for a second...

01:18:57.650 --> 01:19:04.113
just a second, I can trick myself into believing
she’s still alive.

01:19:06.617 --> 01:19:11.783
Sometimes I just need to hear her voice.

01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:18.692
So here we go.
The million-dollar question.

01:19:18.712 --> 01:19:26.506
Emily, you're are now playing
for one million dollars.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:31.090
Remember -
you have three minutes to answer.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:36.228
Three minutes that can change your life

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.398
But I don’t believe a word of it.

01:19:55.541 --> 01:20:01.629
I gave you a chance to confess.
Why didn’t you take it?

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:10.463
No, no, no, what are you doing?

01:20:18.105 --> 01:20:20.097
You had your chance.

01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:26.969
You said you wanted the truth. I’m giving it you.
Just call Dr. Hibbert...

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:29.606
he’ll explain it to you. Please!

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.178
Okay.

01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:59.136
Our subject is - "The death penalty".

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:01.971
Okay.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:06.234
Which of these substances is used for the
lethal medication mix...

01:21:07.488 --> 01:21:11.949
that will cause death within
five to ten minutes?

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:19.372
A: Ringer's lactate solution. 
B: Cefuroxime.

01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:27.298
C: Pentothal. 
D: Sodium chloride.

01:21:32.096 --> 01:21:35.555
Did you transplant a kidney...

01:21:37.393 --> 01:21:40.602
from Jack Tramell
to his sister Dana?

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:46.729
Did you transplant a kidney from
Jack Trammell to his sister Dana?

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.983
It doesn’t matter who I am,
just answer the question.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:59.655
This is not a game.
I’m deadly serious.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.597
Do you believe him?

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:31.315
- Do you believe him?
- No.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:34.690
No.

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:39.402
Put the gun down!
Fuck you!

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:43.105
I'm not the one you’re looking for!
You killed my son!

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:45.162
I have not done anything!

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:00.639
I never killed anyone.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:05.303
I never killed anyone.

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:08.338
You have taken my son.

01:23:08.358 --> 01:23:11.851
Please let me go. Please.

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:16.443
I'm so sorry.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:20.493
I'm so sorry about your son.

01:23:20.954 --> 01:23:27.372
Please, please tell me
I'm not wrong. Please.

01:23:30.380 --> 01:23:35.796
Please tell me you’re the one, please.

01:23:40.891 --> 01:23:42.132
It's okay.

01:23:48.232 --> 01:23:50.440
It’s all right.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:11.585
There's something I must tell you.

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:19.952
That's okay. I’m gonna’ help you.
I’m gonna’ help you.

01:24:19.972 --> 01:24:25.184
Please, please, you don’t understand,
it’s important.

01:25:38.842 --> 01:25:40.991
Hi, this is Dana.
Leave a message...

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:42.718
and I will get back to you as soon as I can.

01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:45.130
It’s me.

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:49.458
Hey, finally, I was worried
I called Hibbert.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:52.095
Yeah, I know. He did great.

01:25:52.898 --> 01:25:56.357
What happened? 
Are you hurt?

01:25:56.693 --> 01:25:57.934
Nothing.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.147
Where are you?
What did you tell Dr. Hibbert?

01:26:02.866 --> 01:26:05.779
I told him to expect a phone call from a women
Regarding the transplant.

01:26:06.495 --> 01:26:08.782
I've heard your voice and I understood
your message.

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:14.542
I explained everything to him.
It was the mother wasn’t it?

01:26:16.254 --> 01:26:17.370
Yes.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:22.626
- Jack.
- It was her.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:28.330
Where is she now? What happened?
Can I help you? Where are you?

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:32.811
Don’t worry, everything...

01:26:35.273 --> 01:26:37.856
Are you alright?
gonna’ be okay.

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:39.187
Jack?

01:26:40.862 --> 01:26:42.148
Answer me!

01:26:43.573 --> 01:26:44.859
Jack!

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:46.782
Jack!

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:49.660
Jack!

01:27:53.769 --> 01:27:55.931
Is that your final answer?

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.013
Yes, it is.
