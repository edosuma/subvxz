Hey, you too... you can learn

That's right.

You got a package here, Carl.

01:34.860 --> 01:36.350
Yeah, Carl, it's true.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.760
You got a package out here.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.430
lf l can open it and play with
whatever is in it,

01:42.500 --> 01:44.160

01:48.510 --> 01:51.480
Yeah, l ordered a hot dog
through the mail.

01:51.540 --> 01:53.170
Well, hot dang diggity.

01:56.480 --> 01:57.850
when it comes
out the other end.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.480
He said he's gonna
give me some hot dog.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.960
Which you will
split with me

02:05.020 --> 02:07.360
after l determine which
half is bigger,

02:07.430 --> 02:09.830
for you have been known
to rook me.

02:09.900 --> 02:10.919
That wasn't a hot dog.

02:11.000 --> 02:11.960
l shook it.

02:12.030 --> 02:14.160
Only processed meat makes
that sound.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.390
Meat make this sound, too.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.960
Ohh!

02:18.040 --> 02:19.060
Oh, no, Meatwad.

02:19.140 --> 02:19.970
No, you didn't.

02:20.040 --> 02:20.870
That was a little one.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.570
Hang on.
Oh, yeah.

02:22.640 --> 02:23.470
Damn.

02:23.540 --> 02:25.240
Jeez, look at that.

02:25.310 --> 02:26.740
The stoop melted.

02:27.350 --> 02:28.370
All right.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.080
You bought the kit.
Cool.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.250
Now, first things first, you rip
those pants off like an ape.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.450
All right,
you conquered step one.

02:36.520 --> 02:39.360
Step two... put the recorder to
your lips, man.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.020
Put them in there like this.

02:41.990 --> 02:43.150
That's where the brains are.

02:43.230 --> 02:44.790
You got to think to play
recorder.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.890
Wait a minute.

02:46.970 --> 02:49.960
Relax, guy.
Those are just wires.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.590
Let them do their thing, man.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.800
They're not hassling you, right?

02:52.870 --> 02:56.360
This is America...
home of the eagle.

02:56.440 --> 03:00.310
Okay, step four... you should
not have bought this recorder.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.780
The recorder is not for
everyone.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.510
You might have a pre-existing
condition

03:04.580 --> 03:06.780
where it's like you're
allergic to recorders.

03:06.850 --> 03:08.010
l'm serious, man.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.250
You are stupid.

03:12.020 --> 03:15.590
Put this on... and play.

03:15.660 --> 03:17.320
Play for me!

03:22.700 --> 03:24.290
"You have lost a kidney.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.360
Move back three spaces."

03:25.440 --> 03:27.300
You get that
card every time.

03:27.370 --> 03:28.200
Damn.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.470
Okay, your roll.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.650
l love family night.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.640
What is that?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.690
Some girl
begging for my body.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.980
That's not a woman.

03:44.060 --> 03:45.580
How can you even tell
it's a woman?

03:45.660 --> 03:47.220
lt sounds like a flute or
something.

03:47.290 --> 03:48.850
l only date women.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.490
Yeah, right,
but what's your point?

03:50.560 --> 03:52.430
l never had one.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.430
And that drives you crazy,
doesn't it?

03:56.340 --> 03:57.500
Huh.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.040
That's kind of weird.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.940
Yeah, that is weird.

04:02.010 --> 04:03.270
l'm gonna go join them.

04:03.340 --> 04:04.740
Damn it.

04:04.810 --> 04:06.040
Carl ordered that kit.

04:06.110 --> 04:07.810
He's gonna score more than l do,

04:07.880 --> 04:09.850
and l've been saving up for
that.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.650
There's only one of them in
existence... probably.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.690
Uh, Carl, who's your friend?

04:14.750 --> 04:18.420
Please do not speak
to the musician.

04:18.490 --> 04:23.430
l am Hoppy Bunny,
and he is here to entertain.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.390
Help me.

04:24.460 --> 04:25.830
Huh?
What's that, Carl?

04:25.900 --> 04:27.530
Help me.
- l-l can't make... what?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.760
Carl, what are you saying?

04:28.840 --> 04:29.670
Help me.

04:29.740 --> 04:30.760
That's right.
Help him out, y'all.

04:30.840 --> 04:33.740
Put your hands together,
let him know you love the music.

04:33.810 --> 04:36.330
When l say "uh, "
y'all go, "oh, yeah."

04:36.410 --> 04:38.570
Ready?
We do a practice run. Ready?

04:38.640 --> 04:40.200
Uh.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.840
Uh.

04:43.420 --> 04:44.880
Uh. You're not doing it.

04:44.950 --> 04:46.380
Come on, do it.
Uh.

04:46.450 --> 04:47.980
Where you going?
Uh.

04:48.050 --> 04:49.210
You going inside?

04:49.290 --> 04:50.650
Don't close the door.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.550
Uh.

04:53.730 --> 04:54.920
Where's the bathroom?
Where's the bathroom?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.050
We don't have a bathroom.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.430
Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.
Never mind.

05:11.610 --> 05:13.740
Shake, what the hell
are all these people doing

05:13.810 --> 05:15.110
dressed like animals
on the lawn?

05:15.180 --> 05:16.150
l don't know.

05:16.220 --> 05:18.620
They paid me to park,
not freaking loiter.

05:18.680 --> 05:19.510
Park?

05:19.590 --> 05:20.550
Yes, park.

05:20.620 --> 05:21.450
lt's English.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.510
lt means "to put your car at rest
at a public or private area."

05:25.590 --> 05:26.680
And how much did you charge?

05:26.760 --> 05:28.390
For parking or
for cigarettes?

05:28.460 --> 05:29.490
Cigarettes?

05:29.560 --> 05:30.690
You sold them my cigarettes?

05:30.760 --> 05:32.560
What?
You said you quit.

05:32.630 --> 05:35.830
Look, l'm dealing with a lot of
bull right now at work, okay,

05:35.900 --> 05:38.030
and l kind of need it to get me
through this hump.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.730
Buddy, l know what you mean.

05:39.810 --> 05:42.040
l'm running a parking business
in our house,

05:42.110 --> 05:43.840
and let me tell you,
that's damn stressful.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.840
What do you mean "in our house"?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.500
Not the house, in your room...

05:47.580 --> 05:51.410
or as it is now known,
level C-4 promenade.

05:52.490 --> 05:53.680
Damn it.

05:53.750 --> 05:56.310
Everybody in the house say "uh."

05:56.390 --> 05:57.910
Uh!
- Uh, uh.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.650
Oh, yeah!

05:59.730 --> 06:01.820
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

06:01.930 --> 06:04.190
Meatwad, l don't think you need to be
hanging out with these...

06:04.260 --> 06:05.090
furry people.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.190
You need to go inside.

06:06.270 --> 06:07.760
But if l go inside now,

06:07.830 --> 06:10.130
l can't be going "uh" and
everybody go "oh, yeah."

06:10.200 --> 06:12.570
Oh, yeah!
- That one didn't count, y'all.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.310
Now l'm doing it.
Uh.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.970
Oh, yeah!

06:17.040 --> 06:19.070
You need to get the
hell off me.

06:19.150 --> 06:21.110
Yeah, don't be hugging
that unicorn.

06:21.180 --> 06:22.840
He gets, like, inappropriate.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.510
And that wet spot keeps growing
on him, man.

06:25.590 --> 06:26.710
You're a newbie.

06:26.790 --> 06:30.720
l'd start out with the frog or
the bumblebee or the tadpole.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.120
Work your way up to the unicorn.

06:32.190 --> 06:33.180
Okay, okay.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.520
Where the hell is Hoppy Bunny?

06:34.590 --> 06:36.560
Oh, he's in the
pleasure chamber.

06:36.630 --> 06:37.690
He's not to be disturbed.

06:37.760 --> 06:38.820
Pleasure cha...

06:38.900 --> 06:41.530
Well, l'll tell you what,
he's about to be very disturbed.

06:42.130 --> 06:43.100
Well, just clamp the main
artery,

06:43.170 --> 06:44.930
and l'll be there as
soon as l can.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.440
Look, it's standard
brain-replacement surgery.

06:47.510 --> 06:49.940
l do them in my sleep.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.340
What do you mean,
what am l doing?

06:51.410 --> 06:53.280
l'm getting my groove on.

06:53.350 --> 06:54.970
l have a life outside
of brain surgery.

06:55.050 --> 06:56.170
That's just what l do for a
living.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.340
lt doesn't define me.

06:57.420 --> 06:59.440
lt doesn't make me a bad
surgeon.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.350
Oh, but furry bunny hands make
me a bad surgeon?

07:02.420 --> 07:05.790
lt may be weird to you,
but it is my religion.

07:05.860 --> 07:06.950
Oh, um.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.850
What the hell do you want?

07:12.930 --> 07:14.520
What have you done
to Carl?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.260
We've unleashed him!

07:17.340 --> 07:19.830
You know you want a piece.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.500
A piece?
A piece of what?

07:21.570 --> 07:23.060
A piece of the animal.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.630
The wires go all the way into
his body.

07:25.710 --> 07:28.180
lt controls him.
He'll die without it.

07:29.180 --> 07:31.480
Get that thing out of him.

07:31.550 --> 07:32.710
No!

07:37.060 --> 07:39.890
Carl.
Carl, stand still.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.190
Carl, please stop prancing
around.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.160
Carl, stand still.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.060
Uh.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.320
Don't dance over there.
Get off of that.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.130
Meatwad.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.960
This is a delicate procedure here.
l'm trying to X-ray Carl.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.370
Will you please stop with the
"uh" and the "oh, yeah"?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.130
lt's a delicate procedure.
- Oh, yeah!

07:53.210 --> 07:54.400
l need quiet here.

07:54.470 --> 07:55.340
Just take them down the hall.

07:55.410 --> 07:58.210
All right. All right. All right.
Let's go down the hall.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.210
Uh.
- Oh, yeah!

08:04.350 --> 08:05.650
What's going on?
- Shake!

08:05.720 --> 08:08.880
Dy-no-mite!
l love that.

08:08.950 --> 08:09.980
Look at this, Shake.

08:10.060 --> 08:11.850
lt appears that
the recorder has fused

08:11.920 --> 08:13.550
with every organ in his body.

08:13.630 --> 08:15.890
lt seems to be controlling his
every action.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.760
l can cure him
with my healing stick.

08:18.830 --> 08:20.230
No.
- Put that away.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.360
You know l'm a gangster, "G."

08:22.440 --> 08:24.700
You just won't admit
it 'cause Styrone

08:24.770 --> 08:26.570
won't let you into the club.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.630
You got to have ice water in
your veins.

08:28.710 --> 08:30.400
Follow me.
- Wait a minute, Shake, Shake.

08:30.480 --> 08:31.840
He's trying to tell us
something.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.980
You're...

08:35.049 --> 08:36.010
you're, uh...

08:36.080 --> 08:38.240
you're happy that the city
repaved the roads?

08:38.320 --> 08:41.010
No, no, it's not that.
- Get a car.

08:41.090 --> 08:43.990
He wants a car to come.

08:44.059 --> 08:46.050
He's trying to kill himself.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.290
Naw, naw, naw.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.550
He's happy with the repaving.

08:48.630 --> 08:49.720
These are brand-new roads.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.630
Carl, if that's what
you want...

08:52.700 --> 08:54.890
let's do this quickly.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.330
Do it, do it!

08:57.500 --> 08:59.160
Hmm.
lt's not loaded.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.870
There's gum in the barrel.
- Come on.

09:01.940 --> 09:03.570
l could have been killed
in that liquor store.

09:03.640 --> 09:04.630
What liquor store?

09:04.710 --> 09:07.940
Shh.

09:08.010 --> 09:11.570
Yes, uh,
leaving a message for Styrone.

09:11.650 --> 09:14.180
Uh, the gun you sold me...

09:14.250 --> 09:15.720
no bullets in it.

09:15.790 --> 09:18.690
ls this your idea of kicking it
real, huh?

09:18.760 --> 09:21.120
'Cause it's not very real to me.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.920
You better text me, dawg,
and explain this.

09:24.900 --> 09:28.160
He usually is good about getting
right back to you.

09:28.230 --> 09:29.060
Look...

09:29.140 --> 09:31.230
He's probably
gonna call back right now.

09:31.300 --> 09:33.200
l do not have time for this, Shake.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.900
Well please tell me
what you do have time for.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.470
Ahh! Yeah, man.

09:37.540 --> 09:38.980
Oh, yeah, that's the spot.

09:39.040 --> 09:41.570
Stress knots all over here.

09:41.650 --> 09:42.840
Oh, yeah.

09:42.920 --> 09:43.880
That feels good.

09:45.120 --> 09:46.810
Oh, yeah, yeah, right there.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.320
Eh, l shouldn't get so worked up
about everything, you know?

09:49.390 --> 09:50.690
l know.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.750
You can't be there every time
Carl makes a bad decision.

09:53.830 --> 09:55.420
You got to live your own life.

09:55.490 --> 09:56.550
l know.

09:56.630 --> 09:57.790
l know, but it's just...

09:57.860 --> 09:59.230
he's so stupid, you know?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.030
Oh, that was Carl.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.400
Naw, naw naw.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.370
We're talking about you right
now...

10:04.440 --> 10:05.490
and the jewel.

10:05.570 --> 10:06.970
Ow! Shake, no!

10:07.040 --> 10:09.670
The jewel is mine!

10:11.110 --> 10:14.550
l have the power
of a thousand suns!

10:15.310 --> 10:17.310
l'll go $20 on this.

10:17.380 --> 10:19.280
$12... that's the best l can do.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.550
All right, how about $20?

10:21.620 --> 10:22.520
How about $12?

10:22.590 --> 10:24.610
You're killing me here.

10:24.690 --> 10:25.880
All right.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.690
Tell you what...

10:27.760 --> 10:29.350
l'll go $20.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.760
Tell you what, l'll go $12.

10:31.830 --> 10:34.490
How about that
boom box back there?

10:34.570 --> 10:36.470
That's an A.M.
transistor radio.

10:36.540 --> 10:40.630
But it will play cassettes,
right, and the MP3s?

10:40.710 --> 10:41.640
l don't know.

10:41.710 --> 10:42.570
Yeah, it does.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.910
Can you throw that in?

10:44.980 --> 10:45.810
Okay, sure.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.070
Yes!

10:47.150 --> 10:48.910
You got a deal, sucker!

10:49.620 --> 10:52.350
l can finally start my deejay
business.

10:52.620 --> 10:54.310
l think my back is infected.

10:54.390 --> 10:56.290
Oh, it's always
about you.

10:56.360 --> 11:01.050
Well, l am working weddings now,
and l am extremely motivated.

11:01.130 --> 11:02.680
What about Carl, y'all?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.130
Hmm, almost forgot.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.390
His tape collection...
get it!

11:08.370 --> 11:09.360
Hey, check it out.

11:09.440 --> 11:11.670
l got the power
of a thousand suns.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.100
Dancing is forbidden

11:13.870 --> 11:15.740
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:17.110 --> 11:18.510
Dancing is forbidden

11:19.380 --> 11:21.210
D-d-dancing is forbidden

11:22.450 --> 11:23.970
D-d-dancing is forbidden
