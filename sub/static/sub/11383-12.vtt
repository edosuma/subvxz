Previously on 12 Monkeys...

00:03.713 --> 00:05.249
You're walking
through a Red Forest.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.840
There's a house
in the distance.

00:07.258 --> 00:08.464

You’ve been there before.

JAMES: The Messengers
went back in time
to paradox Primaries.

00:14.056 --> 00:15.091
There's one
more we don't know.

00:16.350 --> 00:17.385

00:17.602 --> 00:20.969
A paradox so powerful,
it destroys
the fabric of time.

00:21.230 --> 00:23.221
Spit in the face of death,

00:23.316 --> 00:27.855

a machine to bring you back.

00:58.226 --> 01:00.763
The paradox happens
November 7th at that factory.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.061
That gives us 11 months
to find the Primary
before The Messengers do.

01:06.317 --> 01:08.182
The Primary's gotta be
one of the employees.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.648
There are over 200
people who work there.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.570
How are we gonna figure out
which one is the Primary?

01:34.387 --> 01:37.049
JAMES: We’l/have to
get jobs there.
Get to know people.

01:40.268 --> 01:41.758
JAMES: Look out
for the strange ones.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.435
Being Primary is like
being schizophrenic.

01:45.773 --> 01:48.389
Look for people who twitch,
talk to themselves,

01:48.484 --> 01:51.351
don’t fit in with others.
People who stand out.

01:52.280 --> 01:55.443
It's not for them...
They should make up for that.

the Primary isn’t unstable?
What if they seem normal?

02:03.582 --> 02:06.619
JAMES: Then we have to
check everyone,
no matter what.

02:06.919 --> 02:07.954
No exceptions.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.712
Remember, the link between
Jennifer, Tommy, and Kyle

02:11.799 --> 02:14.666
is that they each saw
and drew the same thing.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.421

Geez Louise,
what's the problem, Cole?

idea what a paradox is?

02:34.739 --> 02:35.979
I sure do.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.451
Hey. Give me...

02:47.877 --> 02:50.209
Get your hand off of me.

02:52.590 --> 02:55.753

destroy the world,

03:14.487 --> 03:15.897
and we don't
have a single lead.

03:40.679 --> 03:42.544
You're sure about this one?
He's not Primary.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.301
Did you look at
all the drawings?

03:44.392 --> 03:46.678
Maybe there was some kind of
a code or a pattern.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.930
Did you go through
every single page?

03:49.021 --> 03:51.854
Yeah, the ones that
weren't stuck together.
Trust me, it's not him.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.682
Sometimes you miss things.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.404
Really? Does that make
me stupid, or a liar?

03:57.488 --> 03:59.820
Neither one changes the fact
the guy's not Primary!

04:00.533 --> 04:03.866
Look, we are really scraping
the bottom of the barrel
with these two.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.031
Are you sure that
none of these people

04:06.163 --> 04:07.903
look like The Messengers
you saw in 2043?

04:07.998 --> 04:10.410
I only got a good look at
a few of them, not all.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.999
What about Sully O'Dare
or Andrew Peterson?

04:13.129 --> 04:15.336
One of them could...
No and no.
I checked. I told you.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.629
Check again.

04:16.715 --> 04:19.252
Peterson got fired
for boozing on the job.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.799
He's not even gonna
be there on the 7th.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.969
And O'Dare...
I tried so hard to
get to know O'Dare,

04:24.056 --> 04:25.387
he thinks I'm trying
to get into his pants.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.430
That's what
you're worried about?

04:27.685 --> 04:29.596
None of these
people are Primary!

04:29.937 --> 04:32.019
We got two days left.
We need to focus.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.562
Maybe you've been wrong?

04:33.983 --> 04:35.143
Maybe the Tall Man
lied to you?

04:35.234 --> 04:37.099
We haven't even seen
any sign of a Messenger.

04:37.486 --> 04:38.862
We know there's
gonna be a paradox.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.653
Okay. What about you?

04:42.575 --> 04:43.610
What about me?

04:43.701 --> 04:45.657

you missed something. Hmm?

what you say to me next, Cole.

that they put in her body

05:44.637 --> 05:46.502
is what they use
in mustard gas?

killed people in that war,

lost two sisters today.

We're not losing any more.
It's over.

14:23.613 --> 14:26.320
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna
take your girls?

14:27.909 --> 14:28.944

14:37.127 --> 14:40.335
The only way we survive

14:41.339 --> 14:45.252
is if we find Titan
and we kill The Witness.

14:45.427 --> 14:47.088
We're done here.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.846

set your people straight?

to have a hen today
than an egg tomorrow.

I'll be supervising you.
'Cause the last time
we did thisjob,

and busted his
head clean open.

wanna be dealing with

need cleaning, fixing,

a choice now, do I?

Why don't you let
me supervise instead?

17:21.416 --> 17:22.656
I could use the overtime.

17:22.959 --> 17:23.994
It's gonna be
freezing up there.

You wanna spend
the next three days
shivering your ass off,

for such a shit detail?

The squirrely one on the end.

17:39.684 --> 17:40.844

I did some time.

he was in there with me.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.159
Nurse. Nurse!

30:36.502 --> 30:38.538
Sorry, you know I don't
like calling you that,

30:38.671 --> 30:40.002

finish those courses,

30:40.131 --> 30:41.462
I don't know what
else to call you.

30:41.674 --> 30:42.709
What is it, Dr. Ed?

30:42.842 --> 30:45.049
The kid with the bug
bite and the rash...

30:45.136 --> 30:46.125
I told you, it's not...

30:46.220 --> 30:47.630
Look, Iwent
through this whole book,

30:47.722 --> 30:49.462
I've called every
colleague I have.

30:49.557 --> 30:52.720
Not one of them has
ever heard of anything
called Lyme disease,

30:53.060 --> 30:56.393
or watermelon disease,
or potato disease either.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.014
Look, I got really
good marks in med school.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.356
The patient needs
Penicillin V or he'll die.

31:06.407 --> 31:08.693
Trust me.
Have I been wrong yet?

31:18.044 --> 31:19.409
CASSIE: Where are you
right now?

31:20.421 --> 31:21.831
Someplace warm?

31:22.548 --> 31:23.583
Safe?

31:24.592 --> 31:26.503
Next to someone you love?

31:27.053 --> 31:28.884

a whiskey sour.
Corning right up.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.066
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

31:46.197 --> 31:47.357
Good afternoon, ma'am.

31:47.448 --> 31:49.780
The American
Union representative
dropped this off for you.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.907
He said to say
they found an address

31:52.078 --> 31:53.409
for that name you
were looking for.

31:57.750 --> 31:59.286
WOMAN: And who are you?

31:59.376 --> 32:01.332
Morris Morrison.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.131
(GRUNTS)

32:53.806 --> 32:54.966
Damn it.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.033
What are you doing here?

33:17.204 --> 33:18.580
What are you doing here?

33:19.206 --> 33:20.366
The house?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.166
It's mine.
I bought it.

33:25.171 --> 33:26.536
Why this house?

33:27.423 --> 33:29.539
I was driving by.
Saw the "for sale" sign.

33:31.427 --> 33:32.758
It needs a lot of work.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.011
At the hospital,

33:42.146 --> 33:44.182
they weren't sure
ifyou were
ever gonna wake up.

33:45.566 --> 33:46.726
But I knew you would.

33:48.652 --> 33:49.983
Why did you go?

33:53.782 --> 33:56.649
Iconntdoit
Notaﬁer

33:57.494 --> 33:58.529
So you ran?

33:58.621 --> 34:00.782
I did what I always
told you I was gonna do.

34:01.332 --> 34:03.323
I found a place
for you to be happy.

34:03.751 --> 34:05.161
I mean, look around.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.954
There's no plague here.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.539
There's no Red Forest.

34:10.049 --> 34:12.005
You're safe.
You can live a life.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.292
So that's it?

34:15.679 --> 34:18.512
After all of that,
we just forget
about the future?

34:19.433 --> 34:20.889
I don't know
what else to do.

34:22.186 --> 34:24.393
I'm done trying to figure out
the answer to everything.

34:25.231 --> 34:28.689
We failed,
but for some reason,
we're still here.

34:29.568 --> 34:33.607
You being here
doesn't make sense.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.858
I'm also done
trying to make
sense of everything.

34:36.700 --> 34:38.156
You should be, too.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.367
You can hate me
for leaving.

34:42.665 --> 34:43.871
But I did it for you.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.785
No, you didn't.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.575
You did it for you,
because you're afraid.

(THUNDER CRASHING IN DISTANCE)

35:04.561 --> 35:06.392
You're bleeding.
It's nothing.

35:09.316 --> 35:10.556
Do you have
running water at least?

35:10.734 --> 35:11.769
(CHUCKLES)

35:13.112 --> 35:14.147
JAMES: Yeah.

35:18.492 --> 35:19.902
CASSIE: Easy.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.161
We have to wash it first.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.832
It's not as bad as it looked.
Itjust bled a lot.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.666
Most of the blood...
WOMAN: Most ofthe blood...

35:30.754 --> 35:32.335
...has washed away.

(TICKING)

35:52.860 --> 35:53.895
(CHIMES)

35:55.821 --> 35:57.186
I know this room.

35:58.407 --> 35:59.613
How?

35:59.700 --> 36:01.531
WOMAN: You’re walking
through a Red Forest.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.278
The grass is tall.

36:06.540 --> 36:07.620
It’s just rained.

in the distance.

Cedar and pine.

36:23.724 --> 36:24.964
You’ve been there before.

36:25.059 --> 36:26.344
I've been here before.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.138
You’re not alone.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.224
There is a man.

36:32.483 --> 36:33.848
See him.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.686
Go to him.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.106
Know him.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.867
Like a memory of tomorrow...
Like a memory oftomorrow...

36:48.582 --> 36:49.867
They knew this place.

36:51.168 --> 36:52.328
This moment.

36:54.713 --> 36:55.998
You.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.091

Ramse,
nothing about this place
says "good idea."

39:00.631 --> 39:02.292
Time hasn't collapsed.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.965
Go. Live.
For once, there's time.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.217
But this isn't permanent.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.803
I still die at
the CDC in 2018.

39:09.890 --> 39:11.551
You don't know that.

39:11.975 --> 39:15.638
To hell with causality.
You don't have to
be afraid anymore.

39:16.271 --> 39:19.729
Go live a life that's
not full of fear and death.

39:21.235 --> 39:22.566
But the world will still end.

39:22.653 --> 39:25.235
I know Ramse.
He wouldn't give up.

He found Titan.
He found The Witness.

crashing down
around our heads,

it's over.

what you're doing here,

I'll leave you to it.

Cassie!
What?

39:56.144 --> 39:58.271
I'm leaving you alone.
That's what you want.

39:58.647 --> 40:00.262
That's not why I left.

40:00.774 --> 40:01.934
Then what was it?

40:02.150 --> 40:04.641
I wanted you to be free of me!

You know that's
not why you left me.

You left me because
you're in love with me.

40:22.629 --> 40:24.494

you wouldn't have
anything to lose.
