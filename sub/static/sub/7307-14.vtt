WEBVTT

00:14.989 --> 00:17.824
- Hi. Is everything okay?
- Can you just call AAA?

00:17.909 --> 00:19.901
My cell phone
can't get a signal out here.

00:19.994 --> 00:22.616
- What's the problem?
- I don't know. The car just stopped.

00:22.705 --> 00:24.994
Mind if I look under the hood?

00:25.083 --> 00:26.874
I'm a Lieutenant Commander
in the Navy

00:26.959 --> 00:29.795
stationed in Oceana.
Just wanna help, okay?

00:31.214 --> 00:32.375
Relax.

00:32.799 --> 00:34.507
I was just getting my ID.

00:34.717 --> 00:37.208
I'm a dentist, I don't carry a gun.

00:39.722 --> 00:40.885
I do.

01:21.898 --> 01:23.309
It's my sister's number.

01:23.399 --> 01:25.309
I always use her
as my emergency contact.

01:26.402 --> 01:27.980
No, she lives in Miami.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.444
What difference does it make
if she's local or not?

01:31.532 --> 01:32.943
Well, no. Of course.

01:33.034 --> 01:37.198
I could get a number
of somebody in town. It's just that...

01:37.789 --> 01:41.240
I'll have to call them first
to make sure it's all right.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.077
Fine, I'll call you back.

01:43.169 --> 01:45.327
I'll be your emergency contact.

01:45.421 --> 01:48.873
- Thanks, I'll get somebody else.
- Yeah. What's wrong with me?

01:48.967 --> 01:50.342
Where do I start?

01:50.426 --> 01:53.131
They never call.
They just need a number.

01:54.973 --> 01:56.087
How do you do that?

01:56.182 --> 01:59.349
First team varsity, Ohio State.
So, what do you say?

01:59.435 --> 02:01.475
Fine.
Just don't make a big deal out of it.

02:01.562 --> 02:05.228
Great! So, what are my responsibilities?
Are there any financial ramifications?

02:05.316 --> 02:07.558
Like do I need to give blood
if you get hurt?

02:07.652 --> 02:09.045
See? This is what I was talking about

02:09.070 --> 02:11.257
- making a big deal out of it.
- Maybe I should go by your house

02:11.281 --> 02:13.175
- and sort of check out the floor plan.
- Forget it!

02:13.199 --> 02:17.493
- Forget it, okay? I'll just... I'll ask Abby.
- Suit yourself.

02:17.829 --> 02:18.908
Whoa!

02:19.372 --> 02:20.535
Are you guys Libras?

02:20.623 --> 02:21.786
- No.
- No.

02:21.874 --> 02:24.081
They are so screwed this week.

02:26.546 --> 02:29.251
- Why don't you ask Gibbs?
- Maybe I will.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.923
Why is he carrying
two cups of coffee today?

02:34.012 --> 02:35.506
I don't know, and I don't wanna know.

02:35.596 --> 02:39.380
But it probably has something to do
with one of his ex-wives.

02:39.726 --> 02:40.888
Gibbs.

02:44.897 --> 02:47.270
We have a possible
execution-style murder

02:47.358 --> 02:50.561
of a Navy Lieutenant Commander
in Grayson County.

02:51.821 --> 02:53.446
Let's call Ducky.

02:55.199 --> 02:58.200
You know I have call waiting.
For emergencies.

02:58.286 --> 03:01.571
I don't think
Gibbs even knows what call waiting is.

03:08.921 --> 03:10.665
Gibbs, NCIS.

03:11.215 --> 03:14.300
Hello, Gibbs, NCIS.
You got a first name?

03:14.927 --> 03:17.632
- Jethro.
- Parents had a sense of humour.

03:18.306 --> 03:20.014
Who's the rest of your posse?

03:20.099 --> 03:22.471
Special Agent Todd, DiNozzo.

03:23.019 --> 03:24.727
Our M.E., Dr. Mallard.

03:24.812 --> 03:26.188
What can I do for you?

03:26.272 --> 03:28.472
I understand a naval officer
was killed here last night.

03:28.524 --> 03:29.722
That's right.

03:29.817 --> 03:32.652
- If it's all the same to you, Sheriff.
- Charlie.

03:32.737 --> 03:36.782
Since the victim was a naval officer,
we'd like to take over the investigation.

03:36.866 --> 03:39.618
Well, it isn't all the same to me, Jethro.

03:39.702 --> 03:41.944
The voters of Grayson County
didn't elect me sheriff

03:42.038 --> 03:44.327
so I could cede jurisdiction
to some out-of-towners.

03:44.415 --> 03:47.500
No matter how good-looking
one of them might be.

03:48.127 --> 03:49.538
We'll share jurisdiction.

03:49.629 --> 03:52.962
A murder on a state road in my county?
I don't think so.

03:53.049 --> 03:55.836
- With all due respect, Sheriff.
- Charlie.

03:55.927 --> 03:59.711
The forensic resources of NCIS
dwarf those of Grayson County.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.632
Well, I'll tell you what.

04:03.017 --> 04:05.093
I'll handle the local investigation.

04:05.186 --> 04:07.179
You can have custody
of the physical evidence

04:07.271 --> 04:10.308
for forensic purposes
and do the on-base investigation.

04:10.400 --> 04:13.151
But any prosecution
will take place in Grayson County,

04:13.236 --> 04:17.019
everything runs through me,
no exceptions, and I get full credit.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.988
It's an election year.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.404
What have you got?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.952
Looks like Commander Julius got a flat,

04:26.040 --> 04:27.949
pulled over to fix it,
somebody came along,

04:28.042 --> 04:31.162
robbed him and killed him.
No clothes, no wallet, no watch.

04:31.254 --> 04:33.163
We traced him
through the car registration.

04:33.256 --> 04:36.007
Kate, photos. Tony, laser and sketch.

04:36.092 --> 04:38.665
This reminds me
of the tale of the traveller

04:38.761 --> 04:40.968
who was beaten and left by the highway.

04:41.055 --> 04:45.053
- How so?
- Oh, a man from Samaria came by.

04:45.268 --> 04:46.596
Yes, he saw the poor fellow,

04:46.686 --> 04:48.678
picked him up,
carried him in his arms to an inn.

04:49.856 --> 04:53.355
Bathed his wounds, bandaged him
and left money to feed him.

04:53.609 --> 04:57.192
This was unusual because the
Samarians were considered outcasts

04:57.280 --> 04:59.153
and of low moral fibre.

04:59.240 --> 05:00.520
Yeah, but from then on,

05:00.616 --> 05:03.950
he's been known
as the "Good Samaritan."

05:04.036 --> 05:05.696
Man, you can talk.

05:06.247 --> 05:09.034
- Perhaps over dinner?
- You're cute.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.868
You got no chance, but you're cute.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.332
Now, don't be too swift
in your dismissal, Charlie.

05:13.421 --> 05:15.460
Destiny has brought us together.

05:15.548 --> 05:18.549
You might wanna check
those tarot cards one more time.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.293
This Samaritan
wasn't one of the good ones,

05:22.388 --> 05:24.879
- was he, my friend?
- What have you got, Duck?

05:24.974 --> 05:26.967
Single gunshot to the back.

05:28.686 --> 05:30.061
One, two...

05:31.647 --> 05:33.723
Oh, no exit wound.

05:33.816 --> 05:37.150
Based on the blood splatter,
I'd say he was shot where he dropped.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.525
- Shell casings?
- None that we could find.

05:39.614 --> 05:41.274
We set up grids and went over each one

05:41.365 --> 05:43.939
using a metal detector. Found zip.

05:44.035 --> 05:45.612
- That's odd.
- What?

05:45.703 --> 05:48.906
His hands were bound after he died.

05:49.957 --> 05:52.283
If they were tied before he was killed,

05:52.376 --> 05:55.995
it would've restricted circulation
and the blood would have pooled

05:56.088 --> 05:57.915
and been unable to escape.

05:58.007 --> 06:00.000
Making his hands redder
than the rest of his body.

06:00.092 --> 06:01.373
Yeah, precisely.

06:01.469 --> 06:03.675
- Time of death?
- Oh, Jethro,

06:03.763 --> 06:06.336
you really got to have some patience.

06:11.020 --> 06:12.680
What's his story?

06:13.773 --> 06:16.939
- What do you mean?
- Well, is he single, available?

06:18.736 --> 06:22.235
He's single.
As far as available, I wouldn't know.

06:31.791 --> 06:35.041
I saw a car with its trunk up,
so I pulled over.

06:35.127 --> 06:38.128
Didn't know
I'd be rolling into a crime scene.

06:38.214 --> 06:40.290
What's that cologne you're wearing?

06:40.383 --> 06:41.960
Not wearing any.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.256
Oh, that's me. New perfume. You like?

06:46.639 --> 06:48.762
Got a tow truck we can borrow?

06:48.849 --> 06:50.178
Sure, doll.

06:53.271 --> 06:56.437
- Don't say it, DiNozzo.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

06:56.524 --> 06:58.018
Don't think it.

06:58.484 --> 06:59.765
Too late.

07:01.320 --> 07:04.274
When we get to Oceana,
I want you to search Julius' apartment.

07:04.365 --> 07:05.824
What are we looking for?

07:05.908 --> 07:07.106
Motive to kill him.

07:07.201 --> 07:09.110
You don't think it was
a crime of opportunity?

07:09.203 --> 07:11.955
His hands were tied behind his back
after he was killed.

07:12.039 --> 07:13.880
Well, maybe it was part of
the killer's ritual.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.915
Kate, that's why we're going to Oceana.

07:16.002 --> 07:17.164
Jethro!

07:18.671 --> 07:21.292
I need to know how to get hold of you.

07:21.382 --> 07:25.166
- The number's on the card I gave you.
- What about after hours?

07:26.304 --> 07:30.467
- They can find me.
- Is this NCIS's idea of cooperation?

07:39.525 --> 07:42.941
Based on the width and edges
of the entry wound

07:43.029 --> 07:45.864
and the absence of an exit wound,

07:45.948 --> 07:48.618
I'd say you were killed

07:48.701 --> 07:51.109
by a hollow-point bullet.

07:51.203 --> 07:53.576
Gerald, it's a conundrum.

07:53.664 --> 07:55.621
- What's that?
- How a society

07:55.708 --> 07:58.033
can develop cures
for all sorts of diseases,

07:58.127 --> 08:00.583
can be the same society
that develops a bullet

08:00.671 --> 08:02.913
that does this kind of damage.

08:03.382 --> 08:06.383
Do you know
why they call them dum-dum bullets?

08:06.469 --> 08:07.548
No.

08:07.637 --> 08:11.765
In the late 1890s, the British military
developed them in India

08:11.849 --> 08:13.676
at the Dum-Dum arsenal.

08:13.768 --> 08:15.392
Yes, their use in warfare was banned

08:15.478 --> 08:17.435
at the first
International Peace Conference

08:17.521 --> 08:19.313
in 1899 at The Hague.

08:20.149 --> 08:22.605
I actually find that interesting.

08:23.736 --> 08:25.314
As opposed to what?

08:29.575 --> 08:32.244
- How did he die?
- He was shot in the back.

08:32.328 --> 08:35.993
- Any idea what he was doing out there?
- Has a sister who lives in Kentucky.

08:36.082 --> 08:38.999
Might have been on his way home
from a visit.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.085
- How long had he been stationed here?
- About five years.

08:43.172 --> 08:45.628
Been with the Navy almost 15 years.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.758
It was his life.

08:48.552 --> 08:50.047
Never married?

08:50.429 --> 08:53.514
Well, if he was,
it was before he arrived here.

08:56.352 --> 08:58.973
- How well did you know him?
- Not very.

08:59.689 --> 09:01.765
You were his commanding officer.

09:01.857 --> 09:04.146
Commander Julius
was a bit of an odd duck,

09:04.235 --> 09:06.773
- if you know what I mean.
- I don't.

09:06.862 --> 09:10.148
He was a competent dentist,
but he wasn't one of the boys.

09:10.241 --> 09:12.198
Didn't like to go out and hoist a few,
huh?

09:12.284 --> 09:15.036
Exactly. He would rather sit
in front of a computer screen

09:15.121 --> 09:16.994
surfing for collectibles.

09:17.081 --> 09:20.331
- What kind?
- I don't know. I could ask around.

09:20.835 --> 09:23.622
Know anybody who had
a grudge against him?

09:35.516 --> 09:38.185
I wonder who
Commander Julius' decorator was.

09:38.269 --> 09:39.929
Siegfried and Roy?

09:47.486 --> 09:49.775
Oh, yeah. Nice gear.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.651
Hey, what do you think of this?

09:56.412 --> 09:59.947
"Lgottoomany..."

10:02.126 --> 10:03.750
"I got too many."

10:05.212 --> 10:08.166
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

10:08.257 --> 10:11.293
- What do you think that means?
- I have no idea.

10:16.098 --> 10:18.720
Kate, he got too many.

10:22.062 --> 10:24.055
He collects lunch boxes?

10:24.899 --> 10:28.350
- They're collectibles.
- Yeah, but they're lunch boxes.

10:28.444 --> 10:32.062
Well, so he has an unusual hobby.
My grandfather collected buttons.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.939
He always said,
"Anybody can collect coins or stamps.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.240
"But buttons..."

10:37.411 --> 10:38.442
Oh!

10:39.371 --> 10:41.163
Magnum P.I. lunch box.

10:41.248 --> 10:43.490
Magpi. I love Magnum P.I.

10:43.584 --> 10:46.751
I had one of these in elementary school.
Tom Selleck was the man!

10:46.837 --> 10:49.293
- Are they valuable?
- Probably. Why?

10:49.924 --> 10:52.925
- Could be a motive.
- Yeah. A lunch box deal gone bad?

10:53.010 --> 10:55.418
People have killed for a lot less.

10:56.180 --> 10:59.015
I think I may know what those numbers
were on the computer Post-it.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.880
What is this going to tell us?

11:00.976 --> 11:02.803
He buys and sells lunch boxes on eBay.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.575
We can check his feedback rating,
see if anyone has a beef with him.

11:05.606 --> 11:07.487
Haven't you ever bought
anything on eBay before?

11:07.525 --> 11:08.770
Have you?

11:09.610 --> 11:12.231
Just some buttons for my cousin Petey.

11:13.948 --> 11:15.276
100%.

11:15.533 --> 11:17.821
So much for a lunch box motive.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.461
Somebody's popular.

11:30.047 --> 11:31.245
Not me.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.666
Clerk screwed up again.

11:34.176 --> 11:36.881
And they seem to be
from Sheriff Dupray.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.298
Thought you gave her your cell.

11:40.391 --> 11:42.300
Guess I forgot to turn it on.

11:42.393 --> 11:44.101
What does she want?

11:44.520 --> 11:46.809
She wants to video conference.

11:55.239 --> 11:56.947
What can I do for you, Sheriff?

11:57.157 --> 11:59.648
Jethro, if you're not
gonna call me Charlie,

11:59.743 --> 12:02.116
we're gonna have
a difficult time working together.

12:02.204 --> 12:03.829
Okay, Charlie.

12:05.499 --> 12:09.497
There was a murder two counties over,
very similar to Commander Julius.

12:09.587 --> 12:11.378
In fact, almost exactly the same.

12:11.463 --> 12:12.495
How so?

12:12.840 --> 12:15.509
The victim was found off the side
of a country road,

12:15.593 --> 12:19.460
nude, bound, one gunshot in the back,
no shell casings found.

12:20.222 --> 12:21.503
Who was the victim?

12:21.599 --> 12:23.675
A David Truly.

12:24.226 --> 12:27.476
He wasn't in the Navy,
but he was a civilian employee

12:27.563 --> 12:29.437
at Naval Air Station, Oceana.

12:31.025 --> 12:33.776
I think we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.650
This reminds me of a case
I worked once,

12:41.735 --> 12:42.850
guy hated mailmen.

12:42.945 --> 12:44.522
- Letter carrier.
- What?

12:44.613 --> 12:46.132
They're called letter carriers,
not mailmen.

12:46.156 --> 12:47.187
Since when?

12:47.282 --> 12:49.010
I don't think
there was a specific date, Tony.

12:49.034 --> 12:50.065
It just kind of evolved.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.410
In any case,
is this in any way relevant to our case?

12:54.414 --> 12:56.039
If the Sheriff is right,

12:56.125 --> 12:58.520
we need to figure out
how the killer is choosing his targets.

12:58.544 --> 13:01.064
Well, how does he know the cars that
stop are going to be navy connected?

13:01.088 --> 13:02.250
Maybe he doesn't.

13:02.339 --> 13:04.379
Maybe if someone pulls over
who's not navy,

13:04.466 --> 13:05.545
he just waves them on.

13:05.634 --> 13:07.278
Lot of east-west highways
in southern Virginia

13:07.302 --> 13:08.423
head towards Virginia Beach.

13:08.470 --> 13:10.430
Makes sense a lot of people on them
would be navy.

13:10.472 --> 13:12.595
Get a hold of Truly's personnel records.

13:12.683 --> 13:15.470
See if there's any connection
between him and Commander Julius.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.019
And check Julius' CO.

13:17.104 --> 13:18.183
On it.

13:18.272 --> 13:20.810
I know, you're gonna ask me
to call the LEOs in the other county

13:20.899 --> 13:23.224
and have them ship over the evidence.

13:23.318 --> 13:24.943
Wasn't gonna ask.

13:27.573 --> 13:31.701
Yeah, the bullet entered the back
through the left intercostal space

13:31.785 --> 13:33.825
between the third and fourth ribs.

13:33.912 --> 13:35.821
Now, the trajectory was from
left to right,

13:35.914 --> 13:38.701
indicating that the shooter
fired from the left.

13:38.792 --> 13:42.541
Would you weigh what's left of the liver
for me, please, Gerald?

13:42.629 --> 13:44.254
No problem, Duck.

13:44.798 --> 13:48.084
- Anything unusual?
- Rather straightforward, actually.

13:48.177 --> 13:49.375
That's unusual.

13:49.469 --> 13:52.673
Well, the bullet
took a fairly circuitous route

13:52.764 --> 13:54.971
through Commander Julius
after it entered.

13:55.058 --> 13:58.012
- Usable for ballistics?
- It's difficult to say.

13:58.103 --> 14:01.057
The bullet was a 9mm hollow-point,

14:01.148 --> 14:04.065
sustained some fragmentation.
I sent it up to Abby.

14:04.151 --> 14:06.820
- Cause of death?
- Gunshot wound to the back.

14:06.904 --> 14:09.110
Can't be much more straightforward
than that, Duck.

14:09.198 --> 14:10.656
Well, he bled out.

14:10.741 --> 14:15.118
The bullet was a particularly nasty form
of hollow-point.

14:15.204 --> 14:19.949
When it expanded on impact,
it's copper jacket peeled back

14:20.042 --> 14:23.707
to form six sharp claws,
one of which nicked his aorta.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.624
Excuse me.

14:26.089 --> 14:29.126
Even if he made it to the hospital, Duck,
he didn't have a chance.

14:29.218 --> 14:31.459
Yeah, well, it wasn't
an execution type slaying.

14:31.553 --> 14:33.795
Not that it'd make any difference
to Commander Julius.

14:33.889 --> 14:36.890
But the GSR pattern
indicated that he was shot

14:36.975 --> 14:39.300
from a distance of three to five feet.

14:39.394 --> 14:42.348
The killer tied Julius' hands
post-mortem.

14:42.439 --> 14:43.637
He do anything else?

14:43.732 --> 14:47.481
Well, there's no sign of sexual abuse
if that's what you're asking.

14:47.569 --> 14:51.898
I did find traces of a powdery substance
on his wrist.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.113
- Drugs?
- Oh, I doubt it.

14:54.201 --> 14:58.151
Abby's analysing it now.
I suspect it'll turn out to be corn starch.

14:58.247 --> 15:00.323
Used as a lubricant for latex gloves.

15:00.415 --> 15:04.164
There is actually quite a controversy
about the use of powder

15:04.253 --> 15:06.329
as a donning agent in gloves.

15:06.421 --> 15:07.750
You know, I read that one, Duck.

15:07.839 --> 15:10.627
That's why there are no prints.
Thank you.

15:11.009 --> 15:14.094
Oh. You'll find this interesting, Gerald.

15:20.560 --> 15:21.841
Find anything, Abby?

15:24.648 --> 15:27.684
This is the left rear tyre
of Commander Julius' car.

15:27.776 --> 15:30.777
- Notice anything unusual?
- It's inflated?

15:31.196 --> 15:32.525
Is that a guess?

15:32.614 --> 15:35.070
Or do you actually know
where I'm going with this?

15:35.158 --> 15:36.866
What do you think?

15:36.952 --> 15:38.660
Well, I don't know.
That's why I asked you.

15:38.745 --> 15:41.532
- Why don't you just tell me?
- So you don't know.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.784
I wanna make sure you know.

15:49.923 --> 15:52.414
- We should play poker sometime.
- Yeah, we should.

15:52.509 --> 15:54.383
According to Sheriff Dupray's report,

15:54.469 --> 15:56.592
when she got to the scene
the tyre was flat.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.117
- But I had no problem filling it.
- Sure it's not a slow leak?

15:59.141 --> 16:00.618
This is the second time I've filled it.

16:00.642 --> 16:02.370
And the first time
I had it submerged in water.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.835
There were no bubbles.
There was nothing wrong with this tyre.

16:04.896 --> 16:06.697
Somebody let the air out
to make it look flat.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.042
The killer went to a lot of trouble

16:08.066 --> 16:10.308
to make a crime scene
look like something else.

16:10.402 --> 16:14.186
- Any luck with the tyre track?
- Depends on your definition of luck.

16:14.281 --> 16:18.444
- You're particularly feisty today.
- Thanks for noticing.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.151
I ran the track through
the tread assistant database.

16:21.246 --> 16:24.247
The CD-ROM has over
10,000 tyre tracks for comparison.

16:24.333 --> 16:25.992
It's great for parties.

16:26.084 --> 16:28.789
On top is the partial
we cast at the scene.

16:28.879 --> 16:32.497
- You matched them.
- I did. But here's the bad news.

16:32.591 --> 16:36.589
This particular brand
is like the prom queen of tyres.

16:36.678 --> 16:37.876
It's very popular.

16:37.971 --> 16:41.387
It fits all kinds
of mid-size cars and SUVs.

16:41.475 --> 16:43.800
I hate getting behind SUVs.
You can't see anything.

16:43.894 --> 16:45.934
Do you have a list of the models
that use that tyre?

16:45.979 --> 16:48.387
It's in your e-mail.
And I included the tyre distributors

16:48.482 --> 16:51.399
in the Virginia Beach area
that sell that brand.

16:51.485 --> 16:54.688
So, Julius' prints are all over the car
as you would expect.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.021
I did find some unidentified prints
on the hood.

16:57.115 --> 16:58.823
- Did you run it...
- Run it through AFIS?

16:58.909 --> 17:02.325
- Feisty and psychic.
- It's a killer combination.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.071
I didn't get any hits on the prints.

17:04.164 --> 17:07.200
The interior is clean.
There's no blood, there's no bodily fluid.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.865
But I did find something peculiar
on the trunk lock.

17:09.961 --> 17:11.337
Corn starch.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.038
Ducky.

17:16.093 --> 17:18.928
There's just no way
that this was a crime of opportunity.

17:19.012 --> 17:22.262
Whoever pulled it off
put a lot of thought into it.

17:25.102 --> 17:28.934
Oh! I called the county clerk's office to
see about getting the records sent over

17:29.022 --> 17:30.185
and I get a recording.

17:30.273 --> 17:32.668
And the recording tells me
to call another number, which I do,

17:32.692 --> 17:34.573
which gives me another recording
that directs me

17:34.611 --> 17:36.319
to dial the first number that I called.

17:36.405 --> 17:39.192
- Look on the bright side.
- What bright side?

17:39.282 --> 17:41.240
It's just an expression.

17:44.121 --> 17:49.032
- Big mistake turning off the cell.
- Charlie. I almost didn't recognise you.

17:49.126 --> 17:50.952
Like getting out of that uniform.

17:51.044 --> 17:53.831
Evidence from the other murder.
Special delivery.

17:53.922 --> 17:56.378
Wow! We never get
this kind of cooperation.

17:56.466 --> 17:58.459
It's not a problem. Where's Jethro?

17:58.552 --> 18:00.129
Right here.

18:00.971 --> 18:02.762
Surprised to see me?

18:03.390 --> 18:07.601
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Surprised is one word
that does come to mind.

18:07.686 --> 18:11.019
Case files and photos
from the Halifax County murder.

18:12.399 --> 18:15.898
- Appreciate that.
- Jethro, I think you owe me a dinner.

18:17.154 --> 18:19.277
Have you always been so shy?

18:19.656 --> 18:23.488
Well, Jethro, there are
two kinds of people in this world.

18:23.577 --> 18:26.150
The ones who go after what they want,

18:26.246 --> 18:28.819
and everybody else.
Where are we going?

18:31.835 --> 18:33.543
The cafeteria.

18:55.942 --> 18:58.268
Do you have something to say?

18:58.361 --> 18:59.441
- No.
- No.

18:59.529 --> 19:00.858
What have we got here?

19:00.947 --> 19:03.023
Well, these photos
are almost carbon copies

19:03.116 --> 19:05.738
of the ones I took in Grayson County.

19:06.369 --> 19:08.362
And Charlie put together
a profile of the killer.

19:08.455 --> 19:10.827
White male, age: 25 to 34,

19:10.916 --> 19:13.952
of at least average intelligence,
possibly a military background.

19:14.044 --> 19:16.535
Also makes reference
to a sub-type of serial killer,

19:16.630 --> 19:19.749
the mission-orientated type.
He seeks out a specific group

19:19.841 --> 19:21.842
that he believes the world
would be better without.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.047
Doesn't narrow it down much.

19:23.094 --> 19:25.716
They also recovered a slug.
9mm hollow-point.

19:25.805 --> 19:29.009
- What's the condition?
- It's too damaged to try and match.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.093
Does it say anything there
about the bullet having

19:31.186 --> 19:32.680
six sharp claws?

19:32.771 --> 19:35.392
No, but they don't have access
to the equipment that we do.

19:35.482 --> 19:36.602
Abby might have better luck.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.127
Here's something
you don't read every day.

19:38.151 --> 19:40.152
One of the patrolmen noticed
a wet patch of ground.

19:40.237 --> 19:41.958
Someone took a whiz
on the side of the road.

19:41.988 --> 19:43.758
While they were waiting
for the car to come along.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.821
They dug up the whole patch,
sealed it, tagged it

19:45.909 --> 19:48.578
- and sent it for DNA analysis.
- And?

19:49.037 --> 19:51.789
Hasn't been tested yet
because of a backlog at the state lab.

19:51.873 --> 19:53.071
Get them to send it to Abby.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.333
And remember,
two killings don't make a serial killer.

20:11.518 --> 20:13.060
Z4. Nice.

20:13.520 --> 20:17.470
3.0 litre, 225 horse power,
dual overhead cam.

20:17.566 --> 20:20.057
24-valve inline, six-cylinder engine

20:20.151 --> 20:23.105
with double-VANOS variable
A-valve timing.

20:23.196 --> 20:25.901
- Oh, I love cars!
- There's no flat.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.900
All the other victims' cars had flat tyres.

20:27.993 --> 20:29.902
It wouldn't matter.
She's got run-flat tyres.

20:29.995 --> 20:31.157
They come standard.

20:31.246 --> 20:33.819
Hey, Charlie. Thanks for the call.

20:33.915 --> 20:37.000
- My pleasure, Jethro.
- What do we got here?

20:37.085 --> 20:38.745
A motorist called 911.

20:38.837 --> 20:40.837
Said they saw a car pulled off
the side of the road

20:40.922 --> 20:42.251
with the emergency flashers on.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.463
They sent a patrolman.
This is what he found.

20:44.551 --> 20:45.749
Victim been ID'd?

20:45.844 --> 20:49.094
Lieutenant James Seeger.
Aviator, Oceana.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.090
Sure looks like the work of our guy.

20:51.182 --> 20:52.463
I beg to differ, Kate.

20:52.559 --> 20:56.142
This young man was killed between
2:00 and 3:00 yesterday afternoon.

20:56.229 --> 21:00.393
The body has double lividity.
The blood settled twice.

21:00.483 --> 21:02.642
Killed some place else
and dumped here.

21:02.736 --> 21:04.064
Precisely.

21:04.154 --> 21:05.233
Copycat?

21:05.322 --> 21:07.647
Well, the details
have all been in the press.

21:07.741 --> 21:10.279
They match in almost every respect.

21:10.702 --> 21:14.035
It's nearly impossible
to come to any other conclusion.

21:14.122 --> 21:16.993
That means we have
two killers on the loose.

21:23.331 --> 21:24.576
Three.

21:26.876 --> 21:28.785
I think we're looking for a woman.

21:28.878 --> 21:30.787
Female serial killer
goes against the odds.

21:30.880 --> 21:31.995
It's not unheard of.

21:32.090 --> 21:35.506
- What's your thinking, doll?
- Most men prefer hands-on killing.

21:35.593 --> 21:38.464
Strangulation, stabbing.
Women prefer hands-off killing.

21:38.555 --> 21:39.717
Like these.

21:39.806 --> 21:42.807
Women are meticulous
about leaving the crime scene

21:42.892 --> 21:44.552
free of material evidence.

21:44.644 --> 21:46.886
Which would account
for why we found no shell casings

21:46.980 --> 21:48.308
or fingerprints.

21:48.398 --> 21:51.233
What would cause a man
to pull over on a dark road at night?

21:51.317 --> 21:53.274
- Damsel in distress.
- Exactly.

21:53.361 --> 21:56.860
- Handsome and smart.
- I think our answer is in Oceana.

21:57.448 --> 22:00.734
Go through base records
for any disgruntled civilian employees,

22:00.827 --> 22:04.694
dishonourable discharges,
anybody with a chip on their shoulder.

22:04.914 --> 22:06.195
And what are you gonna do?

22:06.291 --> 22:08.746
I'm gonna talk to
Lieutenant Seeger's RIO.

22:09.544 --> 22:11.252
Can I ask you a question, Gibbs?

22:11.337 --> 22:14.172
Is this one of those questions
where it's not gonna matter if I say no?

22:14.257 --> 22:16.318
I was just wondering
if there was any rhyme or reason

22:16.342 --> 22:18.916
behind how you divide up assignments.

22:20.555 --> 22:21.634
Yeah.

22:29.606 --> 22:32.097
Jimmy liked to take his Z4
up to the Blue Ridge Parkway,

22:32.191 --> 22:34.149
drop the top,
crank up some country tunes,

22:34.235 --> 22:35.895
and just wind it out.

22:35.987 --> 22:38.822
- Something funny about that?
- I hate country music.

22:38.907 --> 22:40.566
We were always arguing about that.

22:40.658 --> 22:42.402
Sometimes he'd take
his fat boy up there.

22:42.493 --> 22:44.403
- His what?
- His Harley.

22:45.955 --> 22:48.992
That was Jimmy, you know.
Fast cars, fast jets.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.457
- The need for speed.
- Exactly.

22:52.086 --> 22:54.756
He had a bad boy vibe.
That was part of his appeal.

22:54.839 --> 22:56.582
When was the last time you saw him?

22:56.674 --> 22:59.130
Two days ago.
We were doing night FCLP.

22:59.218 --> 23:03.133
Yeah, I read his service records.
His fit-reps were all outstanding.

23:03.222 --> 23:04.930
He was a hell of a pilot.

23:05.016 --> 23:07.424
Do you know anybody
who would wanna kill him?

23:07.518 --> 23:08.763
His wife.

23:11.105 --> 23:13.893
Do you wanna take a minute
to think about that?

23:13.983 --> 23:15.442
Don't need to.

23:16.110 --> 23:19.277
- Any specific reason?
- There's a laundry list.

23:19.530 --> 23:22.781
At the top, they're going through
a particularly nasty divorce.

23:22.867 --> 23:25.785
I guess I should say
they were going through a divorce.

23:25.870 --> 23:29.073
- How nasty was it?
- Mutual restraining orders,

23:29.165 --> 23:30.445
yelling and screaming,

23:30.541 --> 23:32.664
each one accusing the other
of cheating.

23:32.752 --> 23:34.211
Any truth to that?

23:34.295 --> 23:36.965
I can't speak for Laura.
Jimmy was a man's man.

23:37.048 --> 23:38.922
He loved the ladies
and the ladies loved him.

23:39.008 --> 23:42.009
But I never saw him cross the line.
I think he would've told me if he did.

23:42.095 --> 23:45.795
- Because he told you everything.
- And I told him everything.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.650
When you trust your life
to someone literally

23:47.725 --> 23:49.848
you usually don't keep any secrets.

23:49.936 --> 23:52.059
Normally,
when someone kills their spouse,

23:52.146 --> 23:54.269
there's a financial upside.

23:54.357 --> 23:56.349
Jimmy have a second job?

23:56.442 --> 23:57.522
No.

23:58.361 --> 24:00.982
He had a very successful grandfather.

24:01.197 --> 24:03.688
He was the original US importer
of Swiss Army knives.

24:03.783 --> 24:07.318
- Made some serious coin.
- And Jimmy was the beneficiary?

24:07.412 --> 24:09.985
Along with his brothers and sisters.

24:10.665 --> 24:13.535
- How well did you know the wife?
- Well enough to know she's crazy.

24:13.626 --> 24:14.955
How crazy?

24:15.211 --> 24:18.461
She hired a Haitian priest
to put a curse on Jimmy.

24:20.049 --> 24:22.540
When was the last time
Jimmy saw her?

24:22.635 --> 24:24.094
About a month ago, I think.

24:24.178 --> 24:26.848
They did most of their talking
through lawyers.

24:27.515 --> 24:30.386
You know that song,
Thin Line Between Love and Hate?

24:31.561 --> 24:34.562
- Nope.
- Doesn't matter, title kind of says it all.

24:35.857 --> 24:38.893
Whoever wrote that
had Jimmy and Laura in mind.

24:50.913 --> 24:52.076
Laura Seeger?

24:52.165 --> 24:53.742
- That's me.
- NCIS.

24:54.542 --> 24:58.041
Special Agent Jethro Gibbs.
Special Agent Caitlin Todd.

24:58.296 --> 25:01.001
- Do you have a minute?
- Sure. Come on in.

25:03.968 --> 25:05.877
His death hit me hard.

25:05.970 --> 25:08.212
Much harder than I imagined.

25:08.306 --> 25:10.215
Given the tone
of your divorce proceeding,

25:10.308 --> 25:12.977
I would guess much harder
than anyone imagined.

25:13.061 --> 25:15.468
I may not have been in love
with Jimmy anymore,

25:15.563 --> 25:17.306
but I still loved him.

25:17.398 --> 25:21.230
Is that why you hired a Haitian priest
to put a curse on him?

25:21.319 --> 25:23.892
I see you've been talking
to Lieutenant Wallace.

25:23.988 --> 25:27.653
- Is it true?
- I told him that, but it wasn't true.

25:28.409 --> 25:30.366
Why tell him that, then?

25:31.287 --> 25:35.154
Jimmy's lawyers were playing hardball.
It was gamesmanship on my part.

25:35.249 --> 25:36.909
When you were together,
did you get along?

25:37.001 --> 25:38.460
God.

25:38.586 --> 25:41.421
We fought like cats and dogs
from day one.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.332
It was part of the appeal.

25:43.424 --> 25:47.125
There was always a certain energy,
a certain juice between us.

25:47.220 --> 25:48.797
What went wrong?

25:49.055 --> 25:50.549
We grew apart.

25:50.890 --> 25:54.010
I know it sounds like a cliché,
but that's what happened.

25:54.102 --> 25:56.509
It got to the point
where Jimmy would rather spend time

25:56.604 --> 25:59.012
out back in his woodshop than with me.

25:59.107 --> 26:01.348
Did anyone else fill the void?

26:01.442 --> 26:04.858
If you're asking me if I had an affair,
the answer is no.

26:04.946 --> 26:06.903
Can we cut to the chase?

26:07.281 --> 26:09.025
Yeah. By all means.

26:09.659 --> 26:11.698
I've read enough books,
watched enough TV

26:11.786 --> 26:15.321
to know that when a husband is killed
under suspicious circumstances,

26:15.414 --> 26:16.743
the wife is the first suspect.

26:16.833 --> 26:20.248
So please don't feel
like you need to beat around the bush.

26:20.336 --> 26:23.787
Ask me what you came to ask me.
I have nothing to hide.

26:25.091 --> 26:27.130
Did you kill your husband?

26:29.428 --> 26:31.587
No, I didn't.

26:33.057 --> 26:35.299
Where were you yesterday afternoon?

26:36.477 --> 26:38.684
I had a half dozen errands to run.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.606
Dry cleaner, bank,
supermarket, hardware store.

26:41.691 --> 26:44.941
I can give you a list
with the approximate times.

26:45.695 --> 26:48.696
Would you be willing
to give us a DNA sample?

26:49.740 --> 26:51.116
Absolutely.

26:52.785 --> 26:54.861
I thought I was going mad.

26:54.954 --> 26:58.074
I mean, the two autopsies
were nearly identical.

26:58.749 --> 27:00.872
It was déjà vu all over again.

27:00.960 --> 27:04.495
- Hey, that's a Yogi Berra quote.
- The cartoon character?

27:04.589 --> 27:07.127
Not Yogi Bear, Yogi Berra.

27:07.216 --> 27:10.003
Well, judging by your reaction,
he's either a sportsperson,

27:10.094 --> 27:12.383
- or a bouncer at a strip club.
- Gentlemen's club.

27:12.471 --> 27:15.093
This autopsy give us anything
the other one didn't?

27:15.183 --> 27:17.140
The bullet was in better shape.

27:17.226 --> 27:19.717
And I noticed something peculiar
in his nose,

27:19.812 --> 27:21.223
so I did a swab.

27:21.314 --> 27:24.101
A swab, Duck?
Kind of old school, isn't it?

27:24.192 --> 27:27.109
Oh, I just go
where the evidence takes me.

27:27.320 --> 27:30.321
I recall a case in my early career,

27:30.406 --> 27:35.068
yeah, before we had the benefit
of all this marvellous technology.

27:35.161 --> 27:39.989
A young man, barely 20 years old, he
had jelly from a doughnut on his face.

27:40.082 --> 27:42.324
- Ducky?
- Yes?

27:42.793 --> 27:45.082
What did you find in his nose?

27:45.171 --> 27:47.626
- Cellulosic fibre, lignin.
- Wood.

27:47.715 --> 27:50.123
Well, sawdust, to be precise.

27:50.218 --> 27:52.210
Hey, Boss, don't you have
some kind of weird thing

27:52.303 --> 27:54.426
about women and sawdust?
I don't think it's weird.

27:54.513 --> 27:57.514
Laura Seeger said that her husband
had a woodshop out back.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.703
Yeah, well, she also said
he hadn't used it in a month.

27:59.727 --> 28:02.894
I mean, it wouldn't still be there in
his nose after a month, would it, Ducky?

28:02.980 --> 28:04.724
No, that was recent.

28:05.149 --> 28:07.225
Well, he could've been
woodworking somewhere else.

28:07.318 --> 28:08.563
Yeah, he could've.

28:08.653 --> 28:11.488
Yeah, something else
showed up on the swab.

28:11.614 --> 28:13.108
A dog's hair.

28:13.908 --> 28:16.695
Laura Seeger had two dogs in the back.

28:16.786 --> 28:20.735
- But she seems to have a solid alibi.
- One of her errands was to the bank.

28:20.831 --> 28:23.501
Charlie could get us
the surveillance tapes.

28:23.584 --> 28:25.328
They'd all be time-stamped.

28:25.419 --> 28:26.617
Yeah, but if she was guilty,

28:26.712 --> 28:29.250
why would she just offer up her DNA
so freely?

28:29.340 --> 28:32.875
Because she didn't know
we had something to match it to.

28:38.057 --> 28:40.050
Oh! Gibbs!

28:41.102 --> 28:43.260
Didn't your momma teach you
not to sneak up on people?

28:43.354 --> 28:44.634
Obviously not.

28:44.730 --> 28:48.348
An ex-boyfriend snuck up on me once,
and he was walking funny for a week.

28:48.442 --> 28:51.942
- Or I should say, funnier.
- What do you got for me, Abs?

28:52.613 --> 28:56.528
If it's what I think it is,
something that's gonna rock your world.

28:56.617 --> 28:58.610
Well, don't keep me in suspense.

28:58.953 --> 29:00.696
I just need a minute and...

29:04.375 --> 29:05.454
That's a match.

29:05.543 --> 29:09.375
- That's right. Ranger talons.
- This is supposed to rock my world?

29:09.463 --> 29:11.255
Pay attention, class.

29:12.633 --> 29:16.049
The left bullet, Ducky pulled from
Commander Wade Julius.

29:16.137 --> 29:18.710
The right bullet
was recovered not from David Truly,

29:18.806 --> 29:20.265
the victim from two counties over,

29:20.349 --> 29:23.184
but from victim number three,
Lieutenant Seeger.

29:23.352 --> 29:26.887
Now would anyone like to tell the class
what this means?

29:27.481 --> 29:29.391
- There wasn't a copycat murder?
- No.

29:29.483 --> 29:31.227
All three were committed
by the same person.

29:31.319 --> 29:33.774
We matched the bullets
from Julius to Seeger.

29:33.863 --> 29:35.405
Wait, that doesn't make any sense.

29:35.489 --> 29:39.154
Why was Seeger killed somewhere else
and then dumped if it wasn't a copycat?

29:39.243 --> 29:41.781
You think Laura Seeger
could have randomly killed two people

29:41.871 --> 29:45.037
to make it look like a serial killer
in order to cover up killing her husband?

29:45.124 --> 29:47.081
Yeah. Two or three.

29:47.168 --> 29:49.479
You think she'd kill again
to keep up the serial killer ruse?

29:49.503 --> 29:50.701
Yeah, sure.

29:50.796 --> 29:53.038
- That's so cold.
- Ice cold.

29:53.132 --> 29:54.484
How are we doing on the DNA sample?

29:54.508 --> 29:56.466
- I just got it two hours ago.
- And?

29:56.552 --> 29:58.545
And you can't rush science, Gibbs.

29:58.637 --> 30:00.907
You can yell at it and scream at it,
but you can't rush it.

30:00.931 --> 30:03.505
How long until
you have something, Abby?

30:03.601 --> 30:05.759
Bare minimum, 18 hours.

30:15.112 --> 30:17.686
All right, let's get this party started.

30:17.782 --> 30:20.736
They had two different cameras
in the main lobby.

30:20.826 --> 30:24.278
I figured you might be able
to doctor one, but not both.

30:24.372 --> 30:27.575
- You looked at them?
- I can't watch movies alone.

30:27.666 --> 30:29.955
I stopped by Blockbuster
in case those are boring.

30:30.044 --> 30:32.036
Got Sleepless in Seattle.

30:34.715 --> 30:37.467
Well, let's see
if Laura Seeger's alibi holds up.

30:47.937 --> 30:49.051
Yep.

30:51.399 --> 30:52.644
That her?

30:53.943 --> 30:55.022
Yep.

30:55.528 --> 30:57.437
I don't like her shoes.

31:06.205 --> 31:07.747
2:33 p.m.

31:07.832 --> 31:11.616
Ducky said the time of death was what?
Between 2:00 and 3:00?

31:13.129 --> 31:15.702
She's in the bank,
right in the middle of it.

31:15.798 --> 31:18.419
It's almost exactly
when she said she was there.

31:18.509 --> 31:20.383
Guess that means she's got an alibi.

31:20.469 --> 31:23.423
She couldn't have gotten from the bank
to the murder site that quickly.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.839
No way she could be our killer.

31:30.387 --> 31:32.961
Obviously, Laura Seeger
couldn't have done it.

31:33.057 --> 31:34.657
Two different angles, both of them lock.

31:34.725 --> 31:37.642
She entered the bank at 2:33 p.m.
She left at 2:40 p.m.

31:37.728 --> 31:39.602
Only one thing we can do.

31:39.688 --> 31:42.144
Go over everything again
from the beginning.

31:42.232 --> 31:44.854
Like my daddy always said,
every path has its puddles.

31:44.943 --> 31:46.796
Do you know what kind of video system
the bank uses?

31:46.820 --> 31:47.935
No, why?

31:48.030 --> 31:51.944
Because if it's a central system,
all the time stamps would be the same.

31:52.034 --> 31:54.192
You just have to change one.

31:54.286 --> 31:56.658
You think she had somebody
inside the bank?

31:56.747 --> 32:00.282
How hard is it for an attractive woman
to get a guy to do what she wants?

32:00.376 --> 32:01.936
- Oh, it happens every day.
- It's easy.

32:01.960 --> 32:04.249
Ladies, think that was
a rhetorical question.

32:04.338 --> 32:05.940
Charlie, can you check out
the bank for me?

32:05.964 --> 32:07.127
Yeah, sure.

32:07.216 --> 32:09.504
And we also need to reverify
all the stops she made

32:09.593 --> 32:12.345
- when she was running her errands.
- Now that one's gonna cost you.

32:12.429 --> 32:15.466
We need to find the murder weapon
and tie it to Seeger.

32:15.557 --> 32:17.384
Yeah. I checked the federal registry,

32:17.476 --> 32:19.829
I checked gun purchase records
in the surrounding five states.

32:19.853 --> 32:23.388
Well, then check ten.
Get me a sales receipt on the ammo.

32:23.482 --> 32:27.231
- Ranger talon is an uncommon bullet.
- I'll do a full background on her.

32:27.319 --> 32:30.486
Start with her parents,
work forward until today.

32:32.574 --> 32:34.900
What are you waiting for?

32:34.993 --> 32:37.829
- You finished with these tapes?
- No, I wanna show them to Abby.

32:37.913 --> 32:40.914
See if the shadows
are consistent with the time stamps.

32:42.334 --> 32:46.913
I'll tell you, Jethro, I'd hate to be
on the wrong side of the law with you.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.508
Special Agent Gibbs.

32:51.593 --> 32:55.508
This must be the follow-up visit
where you have a few more questions.

32:55.597 --> 32:57.923
- Can I come in?
- Of course.

33:05.899 --> 33:07.643
We ran down all your errands.

33:07.735 --> 33:10.689
- Any problems?
- Nope. No.

33:11.905 --> 33:14.942
In fact, if anything,
it was a little too neat.

33:15.451 --> 33:18.286
Well, look around.
It's pretty spotless, huh?

33:19.621 --> 33:23.999
One of my qualities, for better or worse,
is that I'm very organised.

33:24.668 --> 33:26.957
Of course, Jimmy had
another word for it.

33:27.045 --> 33:30.165
- Oh, I'm sure he did.
- It would make him mental.

33:30.924 --> 33:33.131
Jimmy was the kind of guy
who would walk into a room,

33:33.218 --> 33:34.629
drop whatever he was carrying,

33:34.720 --> 33:38.255
and then leave a trail of clothes
leading to the kitchen.

33:40.350 --> 33:42.972
That one of the things you fought about?

33:43.061 --> 33:46.513
- One of the many.
- We did an autopsy on your husband.

33:47.775 --> 33:49.767
I assume that's standard.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.604
Yeah, it is.

33:52.279 --> 33:54.070
What we found wasn't.

33:57.117 --> 33:59.074
Do you want me to guess?

34:00.204 --> 34:02.742
Found something unusual in his nose.

34:03.165 --> 34:05.490
Did a swab. We found two things.

34:06.335 --> 34:07.746
Sawdust

34:08.378 --> 34:09.837
and dog hair.

34:10.797 --> 34:11.877
Okay.

34:12.757 --> 34:15.925
- You have a woodshop out back, right?
- Yeah, I told you that.

34:16.011 --> 34:18.846
And from the sound of it, a dog or two?

34:19.556 --> 34:23.056
Oh! You think Jimmy was here recently,

34:23.143 --> 34:25.302
even though I told you
he hadn't been here in a month.

34:25.395 --> 34:27.388
- You can see why.
- I can.

34:30.775 --> 34:32.235
How did I do?

34:32.820 --> 34:34.444
What do you mean?

34:34.822 --> 34:37.822
You obviously told me that
to see my reaction.

34:42.996 --> 34:45.452
Look, as I said before,

34:45.833 --> 34:49.782
I have nothing to hide.
I didn't kill my husband.

34:51.588 --> 34:52.917
I gave you my DNA.

34:53.005 --> 34:54.630
I don't know what more
you want from me.

34:54.716 --> 34:57.920
That should be enough to clear me,
shouldn't it? Unless...

34:59.555 --> 35:04.216
Unless you have nothing to match it to,
and asking me was another test.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.024
For a navy flyer,
Jimmy Seeger had a lot of cash.

35:12.109 --> 35:15.644
- He inherited it from his grandfather.
- No kidding.

35:15.737 --> 35:17.813
You know what my grandfather left me?

35:17.906 --> 35:20.611
- His button collection?
- I wish.

35:20.701 --> 35:21.981
My cousin Petey got that.

35:22.077 --> 35:25.327
I got 1,000 shares of stock
in a dot-com company.

35:25.414 --> 35:28.368
Well, that's more than Laura Seeger
would have gotten out of her divorce.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.700
She signed a lopsided prenup.

35:30.794 --> 35:33.914
Well, I guess if he died
before they were divorced,

35:34.006 --> 35:36.045
the prenup wouldn't have mattered.

35:36.133 --> 35:37.924
Sounds like a motive to me.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.465
How did Seeger's grandfather
make his money?

35:40.554 --> 35:43.223
Imported Swiss Army knives.

35:43.307 --> 35:47.850
Oh, I love everything Swiss.
Knives, cheese, the Alps.

35:48.645 --> 35:50.056
I even like ABBA.

35:50.522 --> 35:53.191
- ABBA's Swedish.
- I don't think so.

35:55.027 --> 35:57.897
Hey, Boss.
Did she crack under the pressure?

36:02.910 --> 36:04.701
I take that as a no.

36:06.997 --> 36:09.239
Got your 911, Abs. What's up?

36:09.333 --> 36:10.875
Ready to have your world rocked again?

36:10.959 --> 36:12.703
I'm barely over the first time.

36:12.794 --> 36:14.704
I ran Laura Seeger's DNA swab,

36:14.796 --> 36:17.252
and I got the DNA results
back from the urine sample

36:17.341 --> 36:19.879
- taken at the first crime scene.
- And?

36:19.968 --> 36:22.175
- How about a drum roll?
- Abby?

36:22.262 --> 36:25.382
Okay, forget the drum roll.
Although it would have been nice.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.383
- Hey!
- The DNA matched.

36:27.976 --> 36:31.262
- Laura Seeger has an ironclad alibi.
- I know.

36:31.355 --> 36:35.732
- How is it possible they could match?
- They can't, but they do.

36:40.864 --> 36:42.406
We've a warrant to search your house.

36:42.491 --> 36:46.073
I don't understand.
You said that my alibi checked out.

36:46.161 --> 36:48.284
It did. For the murder of your husband.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.448
This warrant is based
on the murder of David Truly.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.200
I don't even know who that is!

36:52.292 --> 36:54.748
David Truly was killed
on US Highway 58.

36:54.836 --> 36:56.663
Your DNA was found
at the crime scene.

36:56.755 --> 36:59.791
- That's impossible.
- Not according to the lab result.

36:59.883 --> 37:01.876
What DNA did you find?

37:01.969 --> 37:04.638
It seems that while you were waiting
for a car to come along,

37:04.721 --> 37:06.429
you had to answer nature's call.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.551
Women don't urinate
on the side of the road.

37:09.643 --> 37:11.137
Do they, Agent Todd?

37:11.228 --> 37:12.473
I don't.

37:15.065 --> 37:16.476
Someone's setting me up.

37:16.566 --> 37:18.855
So you're saying
that someone stole your urine

37:18.944 --> 37:20.023
while you weren't looking?

37:20.112 --> 37:22.899
- Yes!
- And how exactly would they do that?

37:23.281 --> 37:26.199
I've given two urine samples
in the last month

37:26.284 --> 37:28.573
at Oceana Base clinic.
Once for my annual physical,

37:28.662 --> 37:31.663
and once because Jimmy's lawyers
accused me of using drugs.

37:31.748 --> 37:34.583
- You know that's easy to check out.
- Check it out.

37:34.668 --> 37:37.123
- I want you to.
- Who's your doctor?

37:37.337 --> 37:39.330
Commander Margaret Green.

37:41.091 --> 37:43.499
You neglected to tell me
Lieutenant Seeger had filed

37:43.593 --> 37:45.052
a formal grievance against you.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.129
I didn't think it was germane.

37:47.222 --> 37:49.428
A man has been murdered,
you had a grudge,

37:49.516 --> 37:51.176
and you don't think it was germane?

37:51.268 --> 37:52.928
I'm a professional, Agent Gibbs.

37:53.020 --> 37:55.427
I didn't let his complaint
colour my behaviour.

37:55.522 --> 37:56.850
Maybe you should have.

37:56.940 --> 37:58.020
According to the complaint,

37:58.108 --> 38:01.025
you were sexually harassing
Lieutenant Seeger.

38:01.111 --> 38:03.020
Lieutenant Seeger and I

38:03.113 --> 38:07.027
differed in our interpretation
of the events that transpired.

38:07.117 --> 38:08.944
What did the review board conclude?

38:09.036 --> 38:12.404
- Hearing hadn't been held.
- The hearing hadn't been held?

38:12.497 --> 38:15.700
Before it could be,
Lieutenant Seeger was killed.

38:15.834 --> 38:18.159
You trying to insinuate something,
Agent Gibbs?

38:18.253 --> 38:20.376
I don't insinuate, Commander.

38:21.882 --> 38:25.132
- You treat Lieutenant Seeger's wife?
- I treat a lot of people's wives.

38:25.218 --> 38:28.422
- Including Lieutenant Seeger's?
- Including Lieutenant Seeger's.

38:28.513 --> 38:31.087
- She recently had a physical.
- That's correct.

38:31.183 --> 38:33.934
Oh, I'd like to see her medical records.

38:34.311 --> 38:36.718
Only her doctor is privy to those.

38:36.813 --> 38:40.597
NCIS has access to all military records.

38:40.692 --> 38:43.776
His wife isn't military.
She's a dependent.

38:43.862 --> 38:45.440
Doesn't matter.

38:46.323 --> 38:48.197
I've to check on that.

38:48.533 --> 38:50.277
Might take a while.

38:50.952 --> 38:54.286
Where were you between
2:00 and 3:00 p.m., Tuesday?

38:55.248 --> 38:57.455
- At a medical conference.
- Where?

38:58.627 --> 38:59.741
D.C.

39:01.338 --> 39:03.165
We have two great suspects.

39:03.256 --> 39:05.830
Commander Green, because
of the complaint filed against her

39:05.926 --> 39:08.362
which would threaten her pension
and her future with the Navy.

39:08.386 --> 39:11.091
Laura Seeger who'd get diddly
if her divorce went through.

39:11.181 --> 39:15.344
- Green was in D.C. With witnesses.
- Seeger was in the bank on video.

39:15.894 --> 39:18.978
How can our two great suspects
both have ironclad alibis?

39:19.064 --> 39:21.504
I don't know. But only one of them
had DNA at the crime scene.

39:21.566 --> 39:24.188
Well, if you believe Laura Seeger,
then someone planted it.

39:24.277 --> 39:25.985
Green had access to her DNA.

39:26.071 --> 39:29.487
She could easily have done it.
I put my money on her.

39:29.574 --> 39:30.654
Why?

39:31.326 --> 39:35.027
The whole sexual harassment thing,
that's just wrong.

39:37.457 --> 39:39.249
That was Arlene in Records.

39:39.334 --> 39:42.252
I think I just got the answer
to the mystery.

39:43.880 --> 39:46.169
Special Agent Gibbs, this is OnStar.

39:46.258 --> 39:49.212
The vehicle you are tracking
is parked on Owl Creek bridge.

39:49.302 --> 39:51.046
Roger. You copy that, Charlie?

39:51.138 --> 39:53.260
Owl Creek bridge. Copy.

39:53.348 --> 39:55.341
Hey, Boss, we made our pickup.

39:55.433 --> 39:58.637
Let's hope we get there
before someone else does.

40:26.047 --> 40:28.585
Put your hands where I can see them!

40:33.471 --> 40:35.263
Step out of the car.

40:42.314 --> 40:43.642
Step away!

40:46.610 --> 40:48.483
Hands behind your back.

40:48.570 --> 40:50.977
Interlace your fingers. Thumbs up.

41:52.050 --> 41:53.213
Twins.

41:53.885 --> 41:55.878
The holy grail of dating.

41:56.471 --> 41:59.840
- Where do you come up with this stuff?
- Although, twins that kill, not good.

41:59.933 --> 42:02.554
I just can't imagine
killing someone for your sister.

42:02.644 --> 42:06.262
- I would never kill for my sister.
- Yeah, you barely return her calls.

42:06.356 --> 42:10.140
Identical twins, identical DNA
Identical murders.

42:10.235 --> 42:11.397
One for the books.

42:11.486 --> 42:14.006
I'll bet Laura was splitting
the Swiss Army knife money with Linda,

42:14.030 --> 42:15.716
that's why Linda killed
her sister's husband.

42:15.740 --> 42:16.985
Sheriff Dupray's statement.

42:17.075 --> 42:18.403
There's Charlie.

42:18.493 --> 42:21.909
Thank you all for coming.
Before I take your questions,

42:21.997 --> 42:24.238
there is a group of people
that I want to thank.

42:24.332 --> 42:25.932
Oh, we're finally gonna get some credit.

42:25.959 --> 42:28.497
They're sort of the unsung heroes
in all of this.

42:28.586 --> 42:29.997
Not when you start singing.

42:30.088 --> 42:33.539
I would like to express
my deepest gratitude

42:33.633 --> 42:35.922
to the citizens of Grayson County

42:36.011 --> 42:38.252
for putting their faith in me.

42:38.346 --> 42:42.047
I couldn't have solved this triple murder
without your support.

42:42.142 --> 42:43.933
- Now I'll take your questions.
- Sheriff!

42:44.019 --> 42:45.679
In the second row.

42:46.271 --> 42:47.599
Go ahead, doll.

42:47.689 --> 42:49.369
Sheriff, what was the key break
in the case

42:49.399 --> 42:51.605
that allowed you
to link all these murders?

42:51.693 --> 42:53.271
It's an election year.

42:53.361 --> 42:55.769
It was just a combination
of good detective work

42:55.864 --> 42:57.940
and persistence on my part.
