WEBVTT

00:03.570 --> 00:05.550
Oh, it's just so sad.

00:05.550 --> 00:07.340
I know, it's killin' me.

00:07.340 --> 00:09.650
Sorry, but the movie really gets to me.

00:09.650 --> 00:10.570
After the eighth time?

00:10.570 --> 00:13.030
Yes, after the eighth time.

00:13.030 --> 00:14.820
I don't even know why I'm crying over a movie.

00:14.820 --> 00:18.810
I should be crying over about overwhelmed I am at the store right now.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.200
You need more help?

00:20.200 --> 00:21.390
Besides delia?No way.

00:21.390 --> 00:23.240
No, she's just...preoccupied.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.040
Getting ned into that private school proved to be a full-time job.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.520
Right, at the busiest time of your year.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.770
Pretty much.Yeah.

00:28.770 --> 00:32.590
But the leaves have stopped changing, so soon, the tourists will go home.

00:32.590 --> 00:35.750
Look, you need to take a break now, so hear me out, ok?

00:35.750 --> 00:38.570
My mother is gonna have another one of her procedures.

00:38.570 --> 00:39.460
Ha ha.

00:39.460 --> 00:40.780
Tuck or lift?

00:40.780 --> 00:42.160
I don't ask.

00:42.160 --> 00:46.300
But, look, she's gonna be in the recovery center for at least a few days.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.190
You and I can use her apartment in the city.

00:49.190 --> 00:50.090
Sounds great.

00:50.090 --> 00:51.740
Good.

00:53.970 --> 00:55.720
-Ghost in the house?
-Hi, um, are you ok?

00:55.720 --> 00:58.720
No, just a drunk guy.

01:02.590 --> 01:05.120
Hey, somebody get some water, please.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.060
Call 9-1-1, please.

01:07.060 --> 01:08.320
Are you all right, there?

01:08.320 --> 01:09.620
My name's jim, you feeling anything?

01:09.620 --> 01:10.540
I'm sorry, jim.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.190
Oh, it's all right.Put your hand down.

01:12.190 --> 01:12.890
Do you feel anything here?

01:15.480 --> 01:18.640
All right, good.

01:22.340 --> 01:25.620
we really need an ambulance.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.360
He needs to know...

01:31.360 --> 01:33.100
I'll always be with him.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.720
You're worried about him?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.200
I can help you talk to him.

01:37.200 --> 01:40.170
Can you give him one of those?

01:40.170 --> 01:42.410
Then he'd know.

01:42.410 --> 01:44.720
Yeah, I could do that.

01:44.720 --> 01:48.070
I should probably tell him who it's from.

01:48.070 --> 01:50.400
What's your name?

01:51.670 --> 01:54.520
God, what an idiot I am.

01:54.520 --> 01:56.360
The entire rockland U.Rugby team,

01:56.360 --> 01:58.630
and I pass out on their table like a drunken fool.

01:58.630 --> 01:59.830
It's all right.The good news is,

01:59.830 --> 02:01.720
you can hide in here until your cab comes.

02:01.720 --> 02:02.560
Thanks.

02:02.560 --> 02:03.410
I owe you.

02:03.410 --> 02:04.320
Water?

02:04.320 --> 02:05.080
No, thank you.

02:05.080 --> 02:10.090
But if you ever need a lawyer, I'm your--

02:11.280 --> 02:13.130
that's a pretty serious sedative.

02:13.130 --> 02:14.690
You're taking these tonight?

02:14.690 --> 02:17.430
Yeah, I've been, uh, I've been going through a rough patch.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.710
Rougenh ough to want to kill yourself?

02:18.710 --> 02:21.580
Because you mix these with alcohol, that's what's going to happen.

02:21.580 --> 02:22.390
I know.

02:22.390 --> 02:24.710
Just lately, I, uh-
- what?

02:24.710 --> 02:27.680
Huh, feel like I'm going crazy.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.460
Like, uh...

02:29.460 --> 02:35.570
well, ha ha, like I'm being watched, and that's nuts, and this--this makes it better.

02:35.570 --> 02:38.130
Yeah, maybe you need to get some different help.

02:38.130 --> 02:39.490
I actually might know someone who-
- right, you're right.

02:39.490 --> 02:42.430
You know what, thank you, and tomorrow I'm gonna--

02:42.430 --> 02:45.390
this is for you.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.360
Who?Who told you to do that?

02:47.360 --> 02:50.370
Colleen.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.850
Colleen, but she'S...

02:54.680 --> 02:57.940
holy...

02:58.480 --> 03:02.140
that woman was my worst nightmare.

03:36.640 --> 03:37.670
This can't be happening.

03:37.670 --> 03:41.770
Because that girl, colleen...

03:42.100 --> 03:46.220
she died, so, um, how could you talk to her?

03:46.220 --> 03:47.220
Just take a minute.

03:47.220 --> 03:49.460
Sober up before you have any conversations--

03:49.460 --> 03:52.580
if she wasn't your girlfriend, then who was she?

03:53.020 --> 03:56.450
Colleen, um, heh...

03:56.450 --> 03:58.840
oh, we, uh...

03:58.840 --> 04:00.460
we went out a couple times.

04:00.460 --> 04:03.550
She was an intern at my firm for about 2 years.

04:03.550 --> 04:06.000
She was cute, smart, but...

04:06.000 --> 04:08.150
oh, god, this...

04:08.150 --> 04:08.990
this is messed up.

04:08.990 --> 04:09.890
Yeah, it is.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.300
You see, everybody thought she was so great, you know?

04:12.300 --> 04:14.350
But when we went out, I saw something, you know?

04:14.350 --> 04:16.519
She was--she was...

04:16.519 --> 04:17.720
off.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.450
And she fell for you?

04:19.450 --> 04:22.310
I don't know exactly what happened,

04:22.310 --> 04:25.470
but when I didn't ask her out anymore, she, uh, she flipped.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.580
Just became...

04:27.580 --> 04:29.520
obsessed with me.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.750
How, like stalker obsessed?

04:32.750 --> 04:33.960
Yeah.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.970
I mean, pretty much.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.170
Look who's still up studying the...

04:41.170 --> 04:45.200
5 classifications of stalkers.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.610
A little light night reading.

04:46.610 --> 04:48.360
It's a real grimm's fairy tale.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.140
It starts off creepy and then goes to terrifying.

04:51.140 --> 04:52.830
What are you still doing up?

04:52.830 --> 04:54.690
I was getting a little lone wlyaiting for you to come to bed.

04:54.690 --> 04:57.780
I'm sorry.I just couldn't stop thinking about that poor guy.

04:57.780 --> 04:58.690
That's all right.

04:58.690 --> 05:00.660
I'll substitute food for love.

05:00.660 --> 05:02.510
You want a P.B.And j?

05:02.510 --> 05:03.280
No, thanks.

05:03.280 --> 05:06.750
Hey, did you know that most stalkers actually believe

05:06.750 --> 05:09.600
they're in a relationship with the person they're stalking?

05:09.600 --> 05:12.130
Wait, so colleen really thinks shane is her boyfriend?

05:12.130 --> 05:14.170
Yeah, and they're usually mentally ill.

05:14.170 --> 05:16.550
But colleen, she has this kind of...

05:16.550 --> 05:17.810
tic.

05:17.810 --> 05:21.850
Huh, you know, that makes me wonder, because, uh, sometimes muscle twitches

05:21.850 --> 05:23.940
or tics can be a side effect of anti-psychotic drugs.

05:23.940 --> 05:27.900
That's interesting, but I think she is more of an intimacy seeker.

05:27.900 --> 05:29.440
Wants to be loved by her victim.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.460
Usually sending flowers, love notes, rarely violent.

05:32.460 --> 05:35.910
So you think, uh, shane doesn't have to worry about bringing in the pet rabbit just yet?

05:35.910 --> 05:39.360
No, the fatal attraction stalker is actually called the predatory stalker.

05:39.360 --> 05:42.250
They like to isolate or control their victims.

05:42.250 --> 05:46.320
Well, pretty much any stalker ghost would be creepy to me,

05:46.320 --> 05:48.690
so I could kind of understand shane was on a bender.

05:48.690 --> 05:52.600
You kn,ow in some twisted way, colleen actually believes she cares about shane,

05:52.600 --> 05:56.810
which means I have to convince her that the best thing for him is for her to move on.

05:56.810 --> 06:01.160
Well, if she really is a stalker, you know where to find her.

06:01.160 --> 06:04.860
And, uh, you know where to find me.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.670
I know you are not about to take that peanut butter up into my bed.

06:08.670 --> 06:10.430
Uh, no, no.

06:10.430 --> 06:14.270
I was gonna take this peanut butter up into my bed.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.820
Colleen calling...

06:49.720 --> 06:52.770
Stop it!

07:01.960 --> 07:03.940
Every monday...

07:03.940 --> 07:06.640
an orange rose.

07:06.640 --> 07:07.550
Don't forget.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.810
Colleen, I think you've got it wrong.

07:09.810 --> 07:10.750
You're confused.

07:10.750 --> 07:11.730
Shane is not your boyfriend.

07:11.730 --> 07:14.560
You have to send them every monday.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.370
You know, the best thing that you could do for shane is to go into the light.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.920
No.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.210
He needs to know how i felt.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.410
Well, I admit the night is pretty fuzzy, in fact,

07:29.410 --> 07:32.020
I'd kinda chalked it all up to being a drunken idiot,

07:32.020 --> 07:33.920
but I guess that's wishful thinking, isn't it?

07:33.920 --> 07:35.960
Yeah.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.680
I'm just gonna cut right to the chase.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.940
I see spirits, earthbound spirits,

07:43.940 --> 07:46.840
and I've seen colleen.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.830
So...

07:49.330 --> 07:51.770
you're telling me you see ghosts?

07:51.770 --> 07:54.500
I know that it's hard to believe.

07:55.130 --> 07:57.690
This is wild, but, um...

07:58.520 --> 08:00.380
well, I kinda knew it.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.860
Yeah, don't ask me how--

08:03.160 --> 08:04.700
hold on, wait, is she here right now?

08:04.700 --> 08:05.520
No.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.440
No, she was downstairs.

08:08.440 --> 08:12.540
She-- like the phone and the door?

08:12.540 --> 08:14.200
Wow, ok.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.040
At first I was little bit relieved, but now I'm kind of freaking out.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.340
You see, colleen, she was crazy.

08:18.340 --> 08:21.470
Ok, I don't think she wants to hurt you.

08:21.470 --> 08:23.430
If that helps you at all.

08:24.390 --> 08:29.000
she just needs to cross over into the light, and I can help her do that.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.140
Ok...

08:31.140 --> 08:32.950
uh, what I do until then?

08:32.950 --> 08:35.950
Once I get her to trust me, I might need you to talk to her.

08:35.950 --> 08:38.900
No, see, I don't-- I don't want to talk to her.

08:38.900 --> 08:40.350
She's warped.

08:40.350 --> 08:43.080
No, she had this big fantasy of us together.

08:43.080 --> 08:43.940
Couldn't let it go.

08:43.940 --> 08:48.090
She'd make up these insane stories, like trips we had supposedly been on,

08:48.090 --> 08:50.690
romantic dinners, even arguments we'd never had.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.210
Did you ever feel threatened?

08:53.210 --> 08:56.900
Well, it never quite got to where she was leaving dead rats on my doorstep,

08:56.900 --> 09:01.150
but, yeah, she was-- you know, she was sick, mentally--

09:01.150 --> 09:03.800
Hey, my lunch canceled, do you want to--oh.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.600
Excuse me.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.200
I see you've already made other plans.

09:07.200 --> 09:10.620
Uh, no, no, no, richard vaughn, this is melinda gordon.

09:10.620 --> 09:13.460
I met melinda and her husband last night.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.000
Oh, ha.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.300
My mistake.

09:16.300 --> 09:20.050
Just when I see a pretty woman in shane's office, I just assume.

09:20.050 --> 09:21.680
He's our resident heartbreaker.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.420
So I've heard.

09:23.420 --> 09:26.470
Uh, we had a mutual friend--colleen.

09:26.470 --> 09:27.940
Colleen?

09:27.940 --> 09:29.680
Oh, right, pretty intern.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.020
She was very nice, very nice.

09:32.020 --> 09:33.970
She had quite a thing for shane.

09:33.970 --> 09:37.910
Wasn't she the one that quit because he couldn't date interns?

09:37.910 --> 09:39.330
You're romanticizing again.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.200
She actually-- I think she just found a better gig.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.460
It was a pleasure meeting you.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.780
Nice to meet you.

09:49.340 --> 09:52.220
Ok, that was completely embarrassing.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.990
The fact is, I rarely go out.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.770
I'm up for partner, so I pretty much live here.

09:55.770 --> 09:58.130
Do you know how colleen died?

09:58.130 --> 10:00.880
I heard it was some kind of accident, but I'm not really sure.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.550
Well, what about friends?

10:02.550 --> 10:06.190
Family, an address, anything, even a last name?

10:06.190 --> 10:07.440
Finn.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.640
Colleen finn.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.780
But that really is pretty much all I've got.

10:10.780 --> 10:13.840
I mean, I can check to see if the firm kept any records on her.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.480
Ok.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.650
Well, if you come up with anything, um, please call me.

10:18.650 --> 10:20.460
Definitely.

10:20.460 --> 10:22.610
Look...

10:22.610 --> 10:27.520
whatever's going on here, I really need it to stop.

10:27.520 --> 10:29.940
Promise.

10:33.510 --> 10:34.940
Hey, what a nice surprise.

10:34.940 --> 10:36.500
Hi there.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.480
Somebody call for a handyman?

10:39.480 --> 10:42.270
I thought I'd check that circuit problem, being that,

10:42.270 --> 10:45.010
uh, delia might be minding the store on her own this weekend.

10:45.010 --> 10:47.450
That's right, your mom goes into surgery on friday.

10:47.450 --> 10:50.160
Tell me I can live in hope and tell her to leave us the keys to her apartment, right?

10:50.160 --> 10:50.970
It's doable.

10:50.970 --> 10:54.570
It would just be more doable if I could talk to someone who knew colleen.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.680
I can't even find out where she lived or worked, for that matter.

10:57.680 --> 10:58.740
Didn't you say she was an intern?

10:58.740 --> 11:00.650
Have you checked all the law firms in the area?

11:00.650 --> 11:03.380
Yeah, that and every florist within a 10 mile radius.

11:03.380 --> 11:06.600
I mean, she obviously paid cash for those flowers 'cause there was no record of her.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.690
I really am stumped.

11:08.690 --> 11:12.350
I've pretty much used up my quote of favors at the police station looking for your dad.

11:12.350 --> 11:15.440
Yeah, I know, but colleen has got to be on a police radar somehow.

11:15.440 --> 11:18.080
I mean, she was stalking someone, so...

11:18.080 --> 11:19.120
ask.

11:19.120 --> 11:22.670
I mean, if it, you know, means a weekend away, like this one.

11:22.670 --> 11:24.480
It does.I promise.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.700
Oh, hey, battery?

11:25.700 --> 11:27.730
-Yep.
-Ok.

11:31.740 --> 11:34.600
-Talk to you later.Love you.
-Bye.

11:47.590 --> 11:49.530
It's paid to the end of the month.

11:49.530 --> 11:51.840
How'd you know it'd be vacant?

11:51.840 --> 11:53.290
I knew colleen.

11:53.290 --> 11:54.800
Oh.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.220
Maybe you'd know how to get in touch with her family, then?

11:57.220 --> 11:59.070
No one has come for her stuff.

11:59.070 --> 12:01.270
Actually, I was hoping you knew them.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.760
I'd like to talk to them, too.

12:02.760 --> 12:06.320
Well, it's weird, that whole who to contact section of her lease was blank.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.520
So you think maybe she didn't have any family?

12:08.520 --> 12:09.880
Seems that way.

12:09.880 --> 12:11.480
She'd only been here a couple of months.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.760
Kept to herself.

12:12.760 --> 12:17.130
Wouldn't even take the elevator, afraid she might have to ride with someone.

12:17.130 --> 12:19.530
Turns out, it would have been safer.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.820
What do you mean?

12:21.820 --> 12:24.170
She fell down the stairway.

12:24.170 --> 12:26.260
Didn't you know?

12:26.260 --> 12:28.000
And broke her neck?

12:28.000 --> 12:31.140
Yeah, that's how she died.

12:31.970 --> 12:34.700
You're not really here for a rental, are you?

12:34.700 --> 12:36.840
No.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.980
Actually, I'm here to understand more about colleen's death.

12:39.980 --> 12:42.350
Do you mind if I just take a moment, alone?

12:42.350 --> 12:43.860
I got ya.No problem.

12:43.860 --> 12:46.650
Thanks.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.890
Colleen?

13:17.130 --> 13:20.020
Colleen: He needs to know...

13:20.020 --> 13:22.220
how I felt.

13:22.220 --> 13:24.720
He was stalking you, wasn't he?

13:24.720 --> 13:27.200
Colleen, you don't have to do this anymore.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.270
Ok?He can't hurt you.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.590
You're safe now.

13:29.590 --> 13:32.140
There is no safe place.

13:32.140 --> 13:34.040
Yes, there is.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.800
In the light.I can help you.

13:35.800 --> 13:37.760
No.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.840
He's everywhere.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.500
You'll see.

13:58.440 --> 14:02.850
You are my desiny.Love, shane.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.550
Thank you.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.570
Oh, my god.

14:53.570 --> 14:58.890
Colleen, look, I know how upset you must be, and how angry.

14:58.890 --> 15:00.820
I'm gona ruin his life.

15:00.820 --> 15:03.990
I know that what he did was awful, and that you want revenge,

15:03.990 --> 15:07.470
but you were meant to move on, to move past this.

15:07.470 --> 15:10.780
Well, everything that you're doing, hiding in the shadows and...

15:10.780 --> 15:16.550
following people, that's him, not you.

15:17.240 --> 15:21.000
Do you remember where you died?

15:21.000 --> 15:22.970
I remember running.

15:22.970 --> 15:26.930
Was shane there?

15:35.670 --> 15:36.730
I don't know.

15:36.730 --> 15:37.670
That's ok.

15:37.670 --> 15:40.710
I'm sure you had friends, family, or someone we could talk to.

15:40.710 --> 15:43.010
No.

15:43.010 --> 15:47.180
He made them all go away.

15:48.890 --> 15:51.660
Just campbell.

15:51.660 --> 15:53.670
Campbell never left me.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.100
Campbell...

15:55.100 --> 15:58.320
who is that?Is that your boyfriend?

16:10.050 --> 16:12.500
Give me a minute, will you?

16:15.820 --> 16:17.990
This creep isn't stalking you now, is he?

16:17.990 --> 16:20.400
No, he's not.

16:20.400 --> 16:24.170
I just know that he really tormented colleen and you were the detective on the case, right?

16:24.170 --> 16:26.820
I didn't know anything about stalking,

16:26.820 --> 16:29.160
but this guy made me an expert.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.760
So why isn't he in jail?

16:30.760 --> 16:32.640
He's a lawyer.

16:32.640 --> 16:35.680
Knows his way around anti-stalking laws.

16:35.680 --> 16:38.320
And he's smart.

16:38.320 --> 16:43.630
He'll go right up to the line, but he won't cross it.

16:43.630 --> 16:46.340
He seems like such a solid guy.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.970
You know, he's on the fast track at his job, I mean, everyone likes him.

16:49.970 --> 16:52.700
A lot of these guys have high power careers.

16:52.700 --> 16:56.310
But a real relationship would get in the way of their work.

16:56.310 --> 17:00.720
So they create an imaginary one that they can control.

17:00.720 --> 17:05.609
Oh, I think shane carson really believes he was colleen's prince charming, you know?

17:07.319 --> 17:12.369
See, carson is what you call a sociopathic predator.

17:12.369 --> 17:17.920
He isolated her, pushed away everyone so that he would be the only one she had left.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.680
Then how could some creep make all of her friends leave?

17:20.680 --> 17:24.099
By making it so that she wasn't worth the trouble of knowing.

17:24.099 --> 17:27.339
He'd harass these people like you wouldn't believe.

17:27.339 --> 17:33.090
He'd make up lies, manipulate them, you name it.

17:33.090 --> 17:35.740
He wanted her all to himself.

17:35.740 --> 17:38.960
Do you think he had anything to do with her death?

17:38.960 --> 17:40.330
It was my first thought.

17:40.330 --> 17:43.160
But we went through all the evidence.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.180
I couldn't tie him to it.

17:46.180 --> 17:51.470
I can't tell you what it feels like to be a cop, and you can't help someone.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.380
I just wanted to see the light in her eyes again.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.270
You tried.

17:56.270 --> 17:58.980
And you keep trying, and I know that meant a lot to her.

17:58.980 --> 18:02.890
I'm not gonna rest until this son of a bitch is where he belongs.

18:02.890 --> 18:05.630
Be careful.

18:24.380 --> 18:28.030
Is that all you got?

18:36.540 --> 18:39.890
I really loved you, colleen.

18:39.890 --> 18:43.220
We were good together.

18:44.150 --> 18:49.200
Oh, but you never did appreciate all of the things I did for you.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.100
Even when you cheated on me...

18:53.100 --> 18:55.820
I forgave you.

18:55.820 --> 18:58.600
Like with that C.P.A.You remember him?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.650
I knew he wasn't right for you,

19:00.650 --> 19:03.470
but I let it play out.

19:05.140 --> 19:08.400
You hacked into his client's records.

19:08.400 --> 19:12.440
You know, I never told you this, but...

19:12.440 --> 19:14.900
I was there that night you broke up.

19:14.900 --> 19:20.220
Yeah, ha ha, I saw how that creep left you standing alone outside that restaurant.

19:20.220 --> 19:22.530
You canceled his credit card.

19:22.530 --> 19:24.500
The waiter wouldn't let him leave.

19:24.500 --> 19:27.100
And who was there for you through your tears?

19:27.100 --> 19:28.700
No, you, uh...

19:28.700 --> 19:31.750
you broke my heart, colleen.

19:31.750 --> 19:34.090
But you'll never hurt me again.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.700
You're alone!

19:35.700 --> 19:36.740
And desperate!

19:36.740 --> 19:38.220
-It's over.
-Losing your mind!

19:38.220 --> 19:41.150
-We're through.
-No!

19:45.870 --> 19:49.360
I really think you need to move on, colleen.

19:49.360 --> 19:52.390
I have.

19:58.470 --> 20:01.830
She needs me.

20:01.830 --> 20:05.440
Were you there when she said that?

20:05.440 --> 20:07.980
Didn't hit me till later what she meant.

20:07.980 --> 20:11.850
I don't think she even knew what she meant.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.530
Love's funny that way.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.600
No, she asked me to call her, but I don't know.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.820
It's always a delicate thing when someone'S...

20:24.820 --> 20:28.110
discovering their feelings.

20:28.110 --> 20:32.930
Oh, she might appreciate something more personal.

20:46.230 --> 20:48.910
Yes, thank you and I was wondering

20:48.910 --> 20:53.330
if our pd attrition never faxed over those medical forms that--

20:53.330 --> 20:57.310
yeah sure i'll hold. I'll be right with your guys

21:01.200 --> 21:04.130
morgon price academy

21:04.130 --> 21:05.780
that's a good school

21:05.780 --> 21:06.880
do you son go there?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.840
not yet, but we're hoping

21:08.840 --> 21:10.120
can i help you with something?

21:10.120 --> 21:15.060
actruly i m looking for Melinda. I know she's here

21:17.560 --> 21:19.000
what are you doing here?

21:19.000 --> 21:21.500
Bringing you...

21:21.500 --> 21:23.170
this.

21:23.170 --> 21:24.900
Look, I know who you are.

21:24.900 --> 21:26.580
And what you did to colleen.

21:26.580 --> 21:28.260
Hey, look, I understand how you feel.

21:28.260 --> 21:29.610
Ok, I do.

21:29.610 --> 21:31.430
You've only heard her side of it.

21:31.430 --> 21:33.590
Of course you think I'm a bad guy.

21:33.590 --> 21:34.780
But I'm not.

21:34.780 --> 21:36.270
And you know that.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.870
Deep down.

21:37.870 --> 21:40.860
We need just to sort all this out.

21:40.860 --> 21:44.770
And it so happens I know this great little folk art dealer upstate.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.870
Yeah, not even an hour away.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.040
Shane, I'm married.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.220
To a guy who has lots of cop buddies.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.780
Look...

21:53.780 --> 21:55.760
I'm sorry colleen mislead you, ok?

21:55.760 --> 21:58.240
But she mislead me, too.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.970
I know you want to hear me out.

21:59.970 --> 22:01.960
Shane, I am onto you.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.070
Ok?This is not going to work with me.

22:04.070 --> 22:07.360
Melinda?Are you ok?

22:07.360 --> 22:08.700
I think it's time for you to leave.

22:08.700 --> 22:11.030
And don't bring her into this.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.610
Oops, is this a-- is this--is this a bad time?

22:13.610 --> 22:14.330
Yeah, it looks like it is.

22:14.330 --> 22:17.750
We want you to stay the hell away from me.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.890
Oh, got it.

22:19.890 --> 22:21.350
Can't talk now.

22:21.350 --> 22:22.950
Ok, well, cool.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.920
I'll be back later.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.550
Oh, and a real friend...

22:28.550 --> 22:33.920
a real friend doesn't tell someone whom they can and can't be with.

23:29.150 --> 23:31.110
It's happening again.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.360
No, it's not.He--he can't hurt you.

23:33.360 --> 23:36.220
But he can hurt you.

23:44.060 --> 23:46.870
Melinda, are you there?

23:46.870 --> 23:48.780
Delia?

23:48.780 --> 23:50.200
What's wrong?

23:50.200 --> 23:53.280
I was driving home, and I got a phone call from the academy.

23:53.280 --> 23:59.030
They told me that ned's school counselor called to inquire about special ed resources,

23:59.030 --> 24:01.610
like psychotherapy, remedial studies, for ned!

24:01.610 --> 24:02.980
Shane.

24:02.980 --> 24:03.960
Of course.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.140
This is how he works, he's trying to push you away from me.

24:06.140 --> 24:10.850
Well, now it looks like I lied on ned's application, and they will never let him in!

24:10.850 --> 24:13.610
It's started.

24:13.870 --> 24:16.030
What eles?

24:16.030 --> 24:17.850
He'll destroy everything...

24:17.850 --> 24:20.550
you love until there's no one but him.

24:20.550 --> 24:24.140
Till there is no safe place.

24:30.050 --> 24:33.220
I need to know if there's any way I can stop this guy.

24:33.220 --> 24:34.580
He's stalking you now, isn't he?

24:34.580 --> 24:36.420
Yeah, I think so, and I don't want to end up like colleen,

24:36.420 --> 24:38.180
so I need you to do something to trip him up.

24:38.180 --> 24:41.360
Carson probably latched onto you 'cause you're one of colleen's friends.

24:41.360 --> 24:44.360
You know, you gotta consider that everybody in your life may be at risk right now.

24:44.360 --> 24:47.470
Yeah, he already tried some stunt with my friend delia.

24:47.470 --> 24:49.170
How is he getting this information?

24:49.170 --> 24:51.580
He's annoyingly charming.

24:51.580 --> 24:53.670
And he's gotta know his way around computers.

24:53.670 --> 24:57.850
I mean, to do the things he did, you'd need access to socials,

24:57.850 --> 24:59.580
uh, passwords, mother's maiden names--

24:59.580 --> 25:01.200
yeah, but it's illegal.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.410
Yeah, only I'd need a subpoena to get the computer to prove he did it,

25:04.410 --> 25:07.490
and for that, I'd need evidence of wrongdoing.

25:07.490 --> 25:09.630
Plus, he works for a law firm.

25:09.630 --> 25:11.580
Exactly.

25:11.580 --> 25:16.060
Our only hope to nail this guy is to get a hold of those records.

25:16.060 --> 25:19.590
And so far, shane's been way too careful to let that happen.

25:19.590 --> 25:24.530
So other than that, there's absolutely nothing I can do to defend myself against shane?

25:24.530 --> 25:27.680
Why do you think I hate him so much?

25:28.430 --> 25:31.660
Hello?

25:36.900 --> 25:38.980
Ok.

25:47.600 --> 25:54.310
You know, I tried calling you, but my phone wasn't working.

25:56.960 --> 26:00.340
You really went all out.

26:04.060 --> 26:06.350
Jim?

26:10.870 --> 26:14.690
No, this is not happening!

26:19.750 --> 26:22.080
Get the hell out of here!

26:22.080 --> 26:23.620
I thought you'd be happy to see me.

26:23.620 --> 26:27.280
My husband is going to be home any second now!

26:27.280 --> 26:29.670
I don't think so.

26:29.670 --> 26:31.140
What does that mean?

26:31.140 --> 26:34.710
That surgical procedure his mother had to go in for,

26:34.710 --> 26:36.410
ha ha, some kind of complication.

26:36.410 --> 26:38.580
Yeah, he had to rush down there.

26:38.580 --> 26:41.270
Won't be back for a while.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.750
Hello?

26:56.260 --> 26:58.980
Anybody--hi.

26:58.980 --> 27:03.340
Hey, I'm here to see my mom, faith clancy.

27:03.340 --> 27:07.960
Willows medical spa, please hold.

27:18.630 --> 27:21.040
Oh, this can't be happening!

27:21.900 --> 27:23.920
No service

27:27.480 --> 27:28.400
Clancy?

27:28.400 --> 27:30.150
Yeah, she checked in a couple days ago.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.770
She is...

27:32.770 --> 27:34.600
Looks like she checked out already.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.290
Wait a minute, there's-- there's gotta be some kind of mistake.

27:37.290 --> 27:39.100
Her doctor called me, dr.Litvack.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.990
Told me there was some kind of complications, told me to come down.

27:41.990 --> 27:44.050
Can you--can you check one more time?

27:44.050 --> 27:47.570
Clancy.Yeah, says right here dr.Litvack released her at 11:00 this morning?

27:47.570 --> 27:49.360
You sure?

27:49.360 --> 27:51.800
I'm sorry.You should have called first.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.920
Yeah, right.My cell phone's dead.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.330
The service is cut out for...

27:56.330 --> 27:57.630
-thank you for holding
-some reason.

27:57.630 --> 27:59.180
Shane, you son of a-- hey.

27:59.180 --> 28:02.700
I'm really, really sorry about this, it's an emergency.

28:06.130 --> 28:08.730
Come on, honey.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.840
Sorry.

28:43.610 --> 28:44.780
-He's here.
-Yeah, I know,

28:44.780 --> 28:46.870
he's in my front yard.

28:46.870 --> 28:48.750
No.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.220
He's going around back.

28:50.220 --> 28:54.320
Ok, please remember if he pushed you down the stairs.

28:54.320 --> 28:56.370
I can'T.

28:56.370 --> 28:59.010
Can you tell me where he is now?

29:07.600 --> 29:08.740
I don't see him.

29:08.740 --> 29:10.430
What?

29:10.430 --> 29:13.660
He's gotta be out there!

29:13.660 --> 29:15.660
Maybe he's gone.

29:15.660 --> 29:19.960
-Oh, no!
Melinda!

29:19.960 --> 29:21.150
Where is he?

29:21.150 --> 29:24.070
He's outside, out the window!

29:24.270 --> 29:25.550
Hey!

29:25.550 --> 29:27.580
Colleen?

29:27.580 --> 29:30.140
Colleen?

29:31.040 --> 29:32.040
He's gone.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.000
He jumped the fence.I saw a car, but I couldn't get a plate.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.090
I'm gonna call the cops.

29:35.090 --> 29:37.130
No.

29:37.130 --> 29:39.330
He cut the phone lines.

29:39.330 --> 29:40.890
Bastard.

29:40.890 --> 29:42.210
Honey...

29:42.210 --> 29:45.770
hey, hey, hey, hey, it's ok.

29:45.770 --> 29:47.290
I'm gonna go next door and call the cops.

29:47.290 --> 29:50.160
I'm right there, I'm right there.

30:16.150 --> 30:19.640
Colleen?

30:21.500 --> 30:24.030
Colleen?

30:26.340 --> 30:29.580
Colleen?

30:33.620 --> 30:36.820
I thought I could stop him.

30:37.810 --> 30:41.180
But I led him to you.

30:41.510 --> 30:43.090
He'll take your life now, too.

30:43.090 --> 30:44.560
No.

30:44.560 --> 30:47.250
No, that's not ever going to happen.

30:47.250 --> 30:49.520
I was wrong, and you were right.

30:49.520 --> 30:52.110
It is time for you to get your payback.

30:52.110 --> 30:53.480
What do you mean?

30:53.480 --> 30:55.760
We're gonna nail shane.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.690
We're gonna make sure he can never do anything like this again.

30:58.690 --> 30:59.770
How?

30:59.770 --> 31:01.840
Ok, shane was careful.

31:01.840 --> 31:03.490
But...

31:03.490 --> 31:07.910
there's gotta be something he thought no one would ever see...

31:07.910 --> 31:10.560
except a ghost.

31:10.560 --> 31:14.370
I need you to tell me everything you've seen since you've been stalking him.

31:14.370 --> 31:17.270
He really had files eonveryone in your life?

31:17.270 --> 31:18.560
Pretty much.

31:18.560 --> 31:22.170
From my apartment manager to detective campbell.

31:22.170 --> 31:23.490
Where does he keep the files?

31:23.490 --> 31:25.020
On his computer.

31:25.020 --> 31:28.120
He was looking at one when I was there.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.500
He...

31:31.370 --> 31:33.770
he was checking detective campbell's file.

31:33.770 --> 31:36.760
So he's probably keeping everyone's personal information in those files,

31:36.760 --> 31:38.540
like socials, I.D.Numbers.

31:38.540 --> 31:40.320
Did you see anything like that?

31:40.320 --> 31:42.710
I think there were numbers.

31:42.710 --> 31:44.960
I just remember thinking how strange it was.

31:44.960 --> 31:48.260
He had the date when david...

31:48.260 --> 31:52.690
detective campbell started smoking again.

31:53.030 --> 31:54.980
It's funny.

31:54.980 --> 31:57.730
I remember that, too.

31:57.730 --> 32:02.180
I gave him such greif about it, but now...

32:02.180 --> 32:05.800
I wish I hadn'T.

32:06.830 --> 32:10.450
Sounds like detective campbell meant a lot to you.

32:10.450 --> 32:14.780
He was the one person shane couldn't push away.

32:14.780 --> 32:18.160
He was too strong.

32:18.160 --> 32:21.920
He made me feel safe.

32:24.810 --> 32:27.700
You think we really can stop him?

32:27.700 --> 32:32.440
Or are you just trying to get me into the light?

32:34.020 --> 32:37.920
A little of both.

32:49.540 --> 32:53.320
Remember, shane's in court on the bergman case all morning.

32:53.320 --> 32:55.020
Assistant's name is francis.

32:55.020 --> 32:56.730
She thinks you're seeing shane.

32:56.730 --> 32:58.810
That's how he explained your last visit.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.940
Ok.

32:59.940 --> 33:03.150
That could actually help us.

33:03.840 --> 33:05.840
Oh, francis, nice to see you again.

33:05.840 --> 33:06.890
Yes.

33:06.890 --> 33:08.150
-Melinda, right?
-Right.

33:08.460 --> 33:10.680
Um, I know that this is gonna sound silly,

33:10.680 --> 33:12.900
'cause, well, shane is in court, but,

33:12.900 --> 33:15.480
um, he worked really late last night,

33:15.480 --> 33:17.520
and I think I left something behind.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.080
Oh.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.690
-I'll just go in-
- ooh, it's awkward.

33:20.690 --> 33:24.210
And I know that shane and i would appreciate it

33:24.210 --> 33:27.870
if I could just go in and get it myself, seeing as how...

33:27.870 --> 33:29.600
I know what I left behind.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.840
Right.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.760
Go ahead.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.670
Thank you.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.480
Not that one.

33:38.480 --> 33:41.240
It's on his personal laptop.

33:42.490 --> 33:45.140
Nope.

33:48.800 --> 33:52.220
Ok, which one of these is gonna get me into the program?

33:52.220 --> 33:54.910
The first one.

33:56.150 --> 33:58.050
The other one gets you into the file.

33:58.050 --> 34:00.050
Ok.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.500
That's it.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.510
Great.

34:05.510 --> 34:08.620
Go, check.

34:14.210 --> 34:14.980
She's coming!

34:14.980 --> 34:17.300
What?

34:17.300 --> 34:18.520
So embarrassing.

34:18.520 --> 34:21.130
He must have moved it.

34:31.870 --> 34:34.780
What's that?

34:41.940 --> 34:45.530
Wait a minute...

34:50.570 --> 34:55.130
that's my shoe.

35:01.890 --> 35:04.020
That's me.

35:04.040 --> 35:06.000
I couldn't seen if he was

35:06.000 --> 35:07.840
and i paliced

35:07.840 --> 35:10.620
i ran out to the back

35:17.230 --> 35:19.540
on,god

35:19.540 --> 35:23.640
These are all of me.

35:27.370 --> 35:29.310
is there any way you guys were wrong,

35:29.310 --> 35:32.380
could shane have pushed her down those stairs?

35:32.380 --> 35:33.960
No.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.040
There was a security surveillance tape.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.320
Colleen was alone in the stairwell when she tripped.

35:39.320 --> 35:40.920
It was an accident.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.870
And I checked out carson's alibi, it was solid.

35:43.870 --> 35:47.420
Then how did shane take those photos?

35:47.920 --> 35:51.160
Maybe he didn'T.

35:54.690 --> 35:57.670
You should see something.

35:58.270 --> 36:00.650
That's a crime scene photo.

36:00.650 --> 36:03.440
Got it from the cop on colleen's case.

36:03.440 --> 36:05.080
It's a little gruesome, isn't it?

36:05.080 --> 36:10.410
I'm just wondering how you got it, and why you would hang it in your office.

36:12.300 --> 36:15.100
I'm gonna have my hands full with you.

36:15.100 --> 36:16.530
I'm a lawyer.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.190
I have friends in law enforcement.

36:18.190 --> 36:20.560
You framed a photos of colleen's dead body.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.330
That's a little strange, don't you think?

36:22.330 --> 36:24.260
It's my way of remembering her.

36:24.260 --> 36:27.240
Tell him how happy that makes me.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.720
Colleen is happy that you want to remember her.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.710
Well, I hope it brings her some peace.

36:31.710 --> 36:33.110
It does.

36:33.110 --> 36:36.260
Especially now that everyone's going to remember me.

36:36.260 --> 36:37.530
It does.

36:37.530 --> 36:44.080
She's especially happy now that she knows the whole firm will have something to remember her by.

36:44.080 --> 36:49.280
We sent copies to all the partners, along with a note explaining the artwork in your office.

36:49.280 --> 36:52.730
We also made a disk of all the files you kept on colleen.

36:52.730 --> 36:55.900
We sent emails to your clients, but that part was just for fun.

36:55.900 --> 36:57.580
You hacked my computer?

36:57.580 --> 36:59.160
Imagine that.

36:59.160 --> 37:04.500
Yeah, they have a paper trail showing how you destroyed colleen's life and everything that you did to her.

37:04.500 --> 37:08.250
News flash, nancy drew!

37:09.240 --> 37:12.160
You're just some nut I talked to once,

37:12.160 --> 37:14.500
and now you're all over me.

37:14.500 --> 37:16.690
These things you're accusing me of?

37:16.690 --> 37:17.460
No one cares.

37:17.460 --> 37:18.930
Yes, they do.

37:18.930 --> 37:21.070
Because you're a lawyer, remember?

37:21.070 --> 37:22.920
And you broke the law.

37:22.920 --> 37:24.760
She had 10 restraining orders against you.

37:24.760 --> 37:26.560
You stalked her, you harassed her,

37:26.560 --> 37:29.150
you stole her life long before she ever fell down those stairs,

37:29.150 --> 37:33.650
and your chances of making partner right now, by the way, zero.

37:33.650 --> 37:35.180
He's sweating.

37:35.180 --> 37:36.320
Don't stop.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.040
You're a pariah now.

37:38.040 --> 37:40.830
Now you have everything that you wished for colleen--

37:40.830 --> 37:44.940
no friends, no fans, and if there's justice, no job.

37:44.940 --> 37:47.230
It's over.

37:47.230 --> 37:51.240
If you wanted to break up, you-- you should have said something.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.070
We just did.

38:00.520 --> 38:03.740
So, I think we're gonna get him on identity theft, of all things.

38:03.740 --> 38:05.120
Off the files I gave you?

38:05.120 --> 38:06.570
Not exactly.

38:06.570 --> 38:10.180
And I don't even wanna know where you got those.

38:10.180 --> 38:16.220
The photographs, along with colleen's police reports gave us enough to seize the laptop.

38:16.220 --> 38:19.620
I only wish she was here to see it.

38:22.410 --> 38:24.990
I think she knows.

38:24.990 --> 38:27.060
Anyway, I, uh.

38:27.060 --> 38:28.570
Appreciate all you did.

38:28.570 --> 38:30.600
This is enough to put carson away,

38:30.600 --> 38:34.860
and he won't be practicing law anymore, so his life's pretty much over.

38:34.860 --> 38:37.840
Feels really good to finally get this guy.

38:38.790 --> 38:41.310
So thanks.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.730
No.

38:42.730 --> 38:46.800
I may never see him again, I need to tell him...

38:49.820 --> 38:51.480
um, detective...

38:51.480 --> 38:52.810
yes?

38:52.810 --> 38:58.190
Colleen, uh, you should just know how much you meant to her.

38:58.190 --> 38:59.860
What do you mean?

38:59.860 --> 39:02.630
She wasn't as alone as you thought she was.

39:02.630 --> 39:05.120
She had you.

39:05.120 --> 39:08.690
And you never stopped caring about her.

39:08.690 --> 39:13.800
Something tells me that, uh, that wasn't because of your job.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.180
That obvious, huh?

39:18.060 --> 39:22.010
Remind him of the time he walked me home from the station.

39:22.010 --> 39:25.760
He was telling me about his first arrest when he was a rookie.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.970
Do you remember the night that you walked her home?

39:28.970 --> 39:31.590
You were telling her about your first arrest.

39:31.590 --> 39:34.630
She told you that?

39:34.970 --> 39:37.300
It was just a purss natcher.

39:37.300 --> 39:43.080
I chased him into this lake and collared him about chest-deep in water.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.320
And for 2 weeks after that, you had flippers in your locker

39:46.320 --> 39:49.660
and wet wings on your desk.

39:49.660 --> 39:53.150
She laughed so hard.

39:53.600 --> 39:57.720
I hadn't seen her smile like that in a long time.

39:58.760 --> 40:02.920
I just remember wanting to freeze that moment.

40:02.920 --> 40:06.480
And then you got to her house?

40:06.480 --> 40:10.650
I was standing so close...

40:11.620 --> 40:14.210
and I just remember this--

40:14.210 --> 40:18.100
a strand of her hair fell on my face.

40:18.660 --> 40:22.370
I just didn't want to move.

40:25.160 --> 40:28.570
I just wanted to kiss her so bad.

40:28.570 --> 40:32.310
Took everything I had not to.

40:32.310 --> 40:35.530
She trusted me, so...

40:36.110 --> 40:39.370
I couldn'T.

40:40.010 --> 40:42.620
Did colleen really tell you all that?

40:42.620 --> 40:44.590
Yeah.

40:44.590 --> 40:50.210
She also told me that she wished you had kissed her.

41:08.790 --> 41:11.090
hey, wait.

41:12.150 --> 41:13.910
What just happened?

41:13.910 --> 41:16.140
Well, believe it or not...

41:17.400 --> 41:18.690
hey, what's up?

41:18.690 --> 41:19.970
I thought you had the day off.

41:19.970 --> 41:21.970
I just wanted to drop by and tell you the good news.

41:21.970 --> 41:24.360
Ned's application got accepted at the academy.

41:24.360 --> 41:27.360
So how did you undo all the damage that shane caused?

41:27.360 --> 41:30.210
It wasn't easy, but we had his real school counselor call

41:30.210 --> 41:32.970
and just tell them it was a prank.

41:32.970 --> 41:36.180
I am so sorry that you got caught up in all this.

41:37.400 --> 41:38.780
What happened to that creep?

41:38.780 --> 41:42.060
Well, he got fired from his job, the county is pressing charges,

41:42.060 --> 41:45.090
he's out on bail, my guess is he's somewhere laying low,

41:45.090 --> 41:48.240
and jim is walking me home from work every night.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.880
That is so crazy.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.130
Well, I will see you tomorrow.

41:53.130 --> 41:55.260
I have more errands to run.

41:55.260 --> 41:57.090
You know what, I didn't bring those sconces up,

41:57.090 --> 41:58.830
because that basement is dead to me.

41:58.830 --> 42:00.600
All those lights just shorted out again.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.360
Ok.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.330
Bye.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.510
Jim just fixed that!

42:07.510 --> 42:09.890
Yeah, I'm looking for it right now.

42:11.020 --> 42:14.290
Ugh, I'll call you back, delia.

42:15.790 --> 42:19.050
Miss me?

42:21.140 --> 42:22.640
This is my husband.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.330
Like I care.

42:25.890 --> 42:28.620
Jim: Melinda, you're not gonna believe this, but--

42:28.620 --> 42:30.530
shane's dead, right?

42:30.530 --> 42:31.930
Yeah, oded.Pills, booze.

42:31.930 --> 42:33.910
We just got the call.How did you know?

42:33.910 --> 42:35.480
Because he's right here.

42:35.480 --> 42:37.390
Mel, get away from him, now!

42:37.390 --> 42:38.640
Melinda?

42:38.640 --> 42:39.380
Melinda!

42:39.380 --> 42:41.850
This worked out the best all around.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.770
Don't you think?

42:43.770 --> 42:46.400
Now we can be together.

42:46.400 --> 42:49.500
Forever.

42:49.501 --> 42:59.801
