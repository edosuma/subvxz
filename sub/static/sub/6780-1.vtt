42:01.887 --> 42:03.520
you've been skipping practice.

42:03.522 --> 42:06.055
Is that true?

42:06.057 --> 42:06.723
Huh?

42:06.725 --> 42:09.592
I tried to explain everything that's been going on, but...

42:09.594 --> 42:10.693
Yeah, tell everyone, why don't you.

42:10.695 --> 42:11.895
Well, what am I supposed to do?

42:11.897 --> 42:12.762
We're worried about you.

42:12.764 --> 42:14.831
I'm fine, you're the one who let The Paralyzer...

42:14.833 --> 42:16.733
Stop calling her that. I'm worried about you.

42:16.735 --> 42:17.867
Well, we're fine. Shh, shh, shh.

42:17.869 --> 42:23.840
<i>(Female student) I myself learned that people really do care.</i>

42:23.842 --> 42:25.008
<i>You are truly missed,</i>

42:25.010 --> 42:26.876
<i>and I only wish that I could've learned</i>

42:26.878 --> 42:31.781
<i>my self-worth without your tragedy.</i>

42:31.783 --> 42:33.583
What bullshit.

42:33.585 --> 42:34.684
You know her?

42:34.686 --> 42:37.720

42:45.864 --> 42:47.063
(Linda) Aaron!

42:47.065 --> 42:49.198
Will you check the fuse?

42:49.934 --> 42:52.268
(Lucy) That poor boy's mother.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.169
You don't know anything.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.104
Look, Adam, I know that you don't like me

42:55.106 --> 42:57.840
for reasons that your mother has decided to forgive me,

42:57.842 --> 43:00.777
but you do need to respect our friendship.

43:00.779 --> 43:02.045
Yeah.

43:02.047 --> 43:03.146
Don't worry about it, Linda.

43:03.148 --> 43:04.914
He's just going through puberty.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.215
Pubic hair can be really disturbing...

43:06.217 --> 43:09.752
Stop fucking talking about me like I'm not here.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.221
Watch your language, you little shit.

43:12.223 --> 43:13.056
Okay, both of you.

43:13.058 --> 43:14.223
Mom... un-fucking-believable.

43:14.225 --> 43:17.293
Listen, I am your mother, and I love you very much.

43:17.295 --> 43:19.062
And whatever it is that you're going through,

43:19.064 --> 43:21.931
you can tell me... we can talk about it.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.903
I am not going through anything.

43:26.905 --> 43:28.805
You can tell me, anything.

43:28.807 --> 43:32.809
We can get through it. We're here for you, Adam.

43:32.811 --> 43:34.944
I just don't understand.

43:41.118 --> 43:42.018

43:42.020 --> 43:43.720

43:52.663 --> 43:55.031
I think I need to get out of here.

43:57.701 --> 43:59.235
Where would you go?

44:03.007 --> 44:04.907
Anywhere.

44:06.910 --> 44:08.978
Can I come with you?

44:13.117 --> 44:14.784
Sure...

44:14.786 --> 44:16.986
If we had a place to go.

44:19.690 --> 44:21.858
I might know a place.

Get in here.

They didn't see you, did they?

44:41.979 --> 44:43.846
Hi.

44:43.848 --> 44:45.114
Hi.

44:45.816 --> 44:47.316
Could you tell me everything you know

44:47.318 --> 44:49.452
about Francis Wilkinson?

44:49.454 --> 44:52.255
You mean "fuck you" Francis?

44:52.257 --> 44:55.191
I know what everyone knows.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.360
Are you okay, Adam?

44:58.062 --> 44:59.095
Is that really why you're here,

44:59.097 --> 45:01.931
to talk about "fuck you" Francis?

45:04.334 --> 45:05.802
(Laughs)

45:07.004 --> 45:08.371
Okay.

45:08.373 --> 45:12.075
She lived on a little farm

45:12.077 --> 45:15.278
on the hill over by South Bend Road.

45:15.280 --> 45:20.149
And her parents did awful things to her,

45:20.151 --> 45:21.384
at least that's the story.

45:21.386 --> 45:24.187
And then, one day, she had enough.

45:24.189 --> 45:27.023
And you're supposed to be able to...

45:27.025 --> 45:31.360
go down to a little cemetery by the field,

45:31.362 --> 45:33.162
and you can call her up.

45:33.164 --> 45:37.366
And apparently, she's real ornery.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.969
I don't know.

45:44.007 --> 45:46.476
You really have never heard that story?

45:50.047 --> 45:51.280
Adam.

46:11.101 --> 46:13.302
Does that hurt?

46:42.266 --> 46:44.433
Wait, wait...

46:44.435 --> 46:46.302
What are we doing?

46:46.304 --> 46:48.838
(Chuckling)

46:48.840 --> 46:51.908
Usual sex.

46:52.543 --> 46:56.379
You have a condom?

46:56.381 --> 46:58.881
Like, with me?

46:58.883 --> 47:01.984
Uh, yeah.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.085
Aw...

47:03.087 --> 47:05.421
Well, then we'll have to keep things

47:05.423 --> 47:08.524
strictly no penetration.

47:08.526 --> 47:10.893
Um...

47:10.895 --> 47:13.963
Okay.

47:38.455 --> 47:41.858
You have a pretty penis, Adam.

47:44.294 --> 47:46.262
Thanks.

47:51.101 --> 47:55.504
Your... breasts look creamy.

47:58.609 --> 48:00.476
Creamy?

48:00.478 --> 48:02.478
Yeah.

48:02.480 --> 48:05.248
Like white chocolate.

48:27.204 --> 48:29.238
Wait... Gracie, wait, stop.

48:29.240 --> 48:31.941
What's wrong?

48:31.943 --> 48:34.310
Nothing, nothing, I just...

48:34.312 --> 48:37.079
- Did you ejaculate?
- No!

48:37.081 --> 48:39.582
No.

Come here.

49:01.004 --> 49:04.974
I'm thinking about leaving.

Where would you go?

49:11.415 --> 49:14.717

49:14.719 --> 49:16.485
What the fuck, Adam?!

49:16.487 --> 49:19.021
Why are you messing around with Mooney Marks?

49:19.023 --> 49:21.123
I'm not messing around with Jamie...

49:21.125 --> 49:23.726
Call it what you want.

49:23.728 --> 49:27.596
I... I need to get away for a few days.

49:27.598 --> 49:29.465
You can't give him what he needs.

49:29.467 --> 49:30.700
How do you know what he needs?

49:30.702 --> 49:31.534
Oh, and you do?

49:31.536 --> 49:32.501
He just needs to be loved.

49:32.503 --> 49:33.736
You of all people should understand that.

49:33.738 --> 49:36.539
I don't want anyone to tell me who to feel sorry for.

49:36.541 --> 49:39.642
Don't feel sorry then.

49:39.644 --> 49:42.712
Fine, I won't!

50:01.665 --> 50:02.765
You know what?

50:02.767 --> 50:08.404
You are going to be the one that's sorry, Adam.

over there tomorrow, okay?

51:08.266 --> 51:10.499
Okay.

We'll stay in the barn over there.

- The barn?
- Yeah.

A story about me.

55:54.518 --> 55:57.820
Something you remember.

55:57.822 --> 55:59.621
Like this,

55:59.623 --> 56:01.457
I remember this one time

56:01.459 --> 56:04.593
when you won first place at the track meet,

56:04.595 --> 56:06.628
which meant you'd go to State,

56:06.630 --> 56:09.465
and the team picked you up on their shoulders

56:09.467 --> 56:11.934
and carried you around.

56:15.505 --> 56:16.939
You were there?

Of course.

56:21.411 --> 56:23.946
I like watching you run.

56:28.886 --> 56:31.954
You sort of run that way.

I remember this one time...

57:08.958 --> 57:11.894
I think it was the spring

57:11.896 --> 57:14.029
because it was really muddy.

57:14.031 --> 57:15.764
I was running past your house,

57:15.766 --> 57:19.635
and I saw you in your bedroom window.

What was I wearing?

57:44.194 --> 57:47.095
Did I look happy or...

57:47.097 --> 57:49.531

You didn't look sad.

58:14.725 --> 58:17.159
Her parents.

58:19.128 --> 58:22.531
What is she doing?

58:22.533 --> 58:25.701
What she does every morning.

58:28.938 --> 58:31.673
She kills them.

Let's go.

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:41.956
Close your eyes.

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:58.572
I'm ready.

01:23:03.611 --> 01:23:05.245
Butterfly.

01:23:05.247 --> 01:23:06.747
In my mouth.

01:23:06.749 --> 01:23:10.084
Say them in my mouth.

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.996
Butterfly.

01:23:21.998 --> 01:23:23.630
More.

01:23:23.632 --> 01:23:24.498
More.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:26.133
Pollywog.

01:23:26.135 --> 01:23:27.101
Popsicle.

01:23:27.103 --> 01:23:30.437
- Sunflower.
- (Sobbing)

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:48.522
You still see me, Adam, don't you?

01:23:53.128 --> 01:23:53.761
I still see you.

01:23:53.763 --> 01:23:58.132
(Aaron) Who the fuck are you talking to?

01:23:58.134 --> 01:24:00.300
No one.

01:24:00.302 --> 01:24:04.304
You really are bat-shit crazy, huh?

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:07.074
Looks like you're famous.

01:24:07.076 --> 01:24:10.344
For being a freak.

01:24:20.522 --> 01:24:24.425
You look happy in that picture.

01:24:24.427 --> 01:24:28.162
Why don't you look happy now?

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:35.602
You're not gonna leave me, Adam, are you?

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:39.840
Not like everyone else.

01:24:43.445 --> 01:24:47.281
Promise... promise me.

01:24:51.553 --> 01:24:54.688
I need you to say it.

01:24:57.792 --> 01:25:00.627
I promise.

01:25:03.198 --> 01:25:07.734
(Window tapping)

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:19.513
What time is it?

01:25:19.515 --> 01:25:22.449
Can we talk, please?

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.158
My parents caught me sneaking out to see you,

01:25:31.160 --> 01:25:34.428
and I didn't know what else to do.

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:38.499
I'm sorry about earlier.

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:41.268
About everything.

01:25:43.671 --> 01:25:47.307
I didn't tell them about the fire.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:52.713
I thought I could fix things.

01:25:52.715 --> 01:25:54.448
You know, make it better somehow.

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:55.415
I... I should've listened.

01:25:55.417 --> 01:25:57.885
I should've, but everything's just getting worse.

01:25:57.887 --> 01:25:59.486
Hey.

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:00.854
I don't know what to do.

01:26:00.856 --> 01:26:02.556
Adam.

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:06.493
I have something you should see.

01:26:22.810 --> 01:26:24.411
What is this?

01:26:24.413 --> 01:26:27.214
Just read it.

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:33.420
"Things I'd Like to Kill.”

01:26:33.422 --> 01:26:34.521
"My mother's ceramic nativity

01:26:34.523 --> 01:26:37.324
"that she keeps out all fucking year long,

01:26:37.326 --> 01:26:40.327
Artie Chapman's plastered on smile."

01:26:40.329 --> 01:26:42.462
Where'd you find this?

01:26:42.464 --> 01:26:45.599
He had it when I found him.

01:26:45.601 --> 01:26:46.466
Just keep reading.

01:26:46.468 --> 01:26:48.635
"My father, wherever he is,

01:26:48.637 --> 01:26:51.872
"Matt Harden and the entire varsity team,

01:26:51.874 --> 01:26:53.407
"except for...

01:26:53.409 --> 01:26:57.277
“Adam McCormick, of course.

01:27:03.718 --> 01:27:06.253
"Myself."

01:27:11.359 --> 01:27:14.695
Who else has seen this?

01:27:14.697 --> 01:27:16.697
No one.

01:27:17.832 --> 01:27:19.533
Why not?

01:27:19.535 --> 01:27:19.967
'Cause...

01:27:19.969 --> 01:27:24.705
Adam, do you think that anyone would have thought twice

01:27:24.707 --> 01:27:26.440
about the way they treated him

01:27:26.442 --> 01:27:28.475
if they never had to think that it might have been

01:27:28.477 --> 01:27:31.712
one of us who killed him?

01:27:40.021 --> 01:27:43.557
They did kill him.

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:45.659
Exactly.

01:27:46.894 --> 01:27:49.997
Now do you understand...

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.968
I was only trying to help.

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:57.504
Who says I need fixing?

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:04.878
Jamie, what is this?

01:28:06.648 --> 01:28:08.048
That's mine.

01:28:08.050 --> 01:28:08.882
She had no right!

01:28:08.884 --> 01:28:10.350
(Gracie) I didn't mean to take it.

01:28:10.352 --> 01:28:12.753
- I didn't... I found it.
- Ssh!

01:28:14.389 --> 01:28:18.825
Really doesn't matter, Adam, not anymore.

01:28:19.694 --> 01:28:24.698
Don't you see, we can make this work.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.301
Make what work?

01:28:33.841 --> 01:28:35.042
This.

01:28:35.044 --> 01:28:37.878
Me and you.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:39.446
Well, we can't... I can't.

01:28:39.448 --> 01:28:43.884
Don't listen to her, Adam!

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.719
She's just jealous.

01:28:45.721 --> 01:28:46.386
Jealous.

01:28:46.388 --> 01:28:50.724
Jamie, listen to me, you gotta calm down.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:58.565
You have to go.

01:28:58.567 --> 01:28:59.700
Just drop it.

01:28:59.702 --> 01:29:00.801
Drop the whole thing.

01:29:00.803 --> 01:29:02.969
I will not drop it!

01:29:02.971 --> 01:29:04.838
And you're right, I don't understand.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.341
But I know that I can't change what happened to you...

01:29:07.343 --> 01:29:10.544
You don't know anything about...

01:29:10.546 --> 01:29:13.513
(Muttering) It’s over...

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:19.519
Just come home.

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:21.922
Come home, Adam.

01:29:21.924 --> 01:29:22.522
We can...

01:29:22.524 --> 01:29:24.458
Stop telling me what to do!

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:26.093
Stop hanging around my closet,

01:29:26.095 --> 01:29:27.961
and stop taking my words!

01:29:27.963 --> 01:29:28.895
Jamie, Adam can't fix...

01:29:28.897 --> 01:29:29.963
This has nothing to do with you!

01:29:29.965 --> 01:29:31.031
What happened to you was awful,

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:34.568
but that does not mean you can come into our lives...

01:29:34.570 --> 01:29:35.702
(Shouting)

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:39.606
Stop it!

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:41.875
Jamie, Jamie!

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.610
Listen to me!

01:29:43.612 --> 01:29:46.947
Is this how you want me to remember you?

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:48.815
Look at me.

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:51.752
'Cause that's not what I want.

01:29:54.689 --> 01:29:58.158
You don't know what you did.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:00.894
You didn't do it.

01:30:00.896 --> 01:30:02.429
Let me go.

01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:04.831
Leave me alone!

01:30:23.751 --> 01:30:27.154

I'm sorry about your rock collection.

01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:55.909
It wasn't really mine anyways.

I'm sorry that I took your list.

01:32:02.149 --> 01:32:04.851
That's okay.

Are you sure?

01:33:04.146 --> 01:33:07.013
How will you get home?

01:33:07.015 --> 01:33:09.082
I'm sure.

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:44.084
(Jamie) You could come with me.

I'll see you again.

You'll be fine too, you know?

Yeah, I know.

I got something for you.

Love.

I will.
