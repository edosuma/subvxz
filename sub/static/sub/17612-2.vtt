00:27.309 --> 00:29.279
Oh.

00:29.311 --> 00:31.014
Hello there.

00:31.047 --> 00:33.617
For a minute, I... I
thought you were me.

00:35.617 --> 00:37.920
Must be losing my noodle.

00:39.455 --> 00:42.025
Okay, then.

01:37.852 --> 01:39.622
The beast is coming!

01:39.655 --> 01:41.424
The beast is coming!

01:41.456 --> 01:43.291
Woe unto you, Willard's Mill.

01:43.325 --> 01:44.627
The beast is coming.

01:44.659 --> 01:45.894
He comes for you.

01:45.927 --> 01:47.662
He comes for all of us.

01:47.695 --> 01:49.632
The beast takes many forms.

01:49.664 --> 01:51.967
Yes, the beast approaches,

01:52.001 --> 01:54.971
and his fire will rain down upon us.

01:55.004 --> 01:57.907
Okay. That concludes this
morning's beast update.

01:57.939 --> 01:59.242
Move along.

01:59.275 --> 02:00.376
To where?

02:00.408 --> 02:03.345
There is no escape. Not for you.

02:03.379 --> 02:05.648
Tell you what. I'm gonna worry about me.

02:05.680 --> 02:06.649
You're disturbing the peace,

02:06.682 --> 02:09.852
so move it along or I'm
gonna give you a fine.

02:09.883 --> 02:11.786
You know, Stan never gave me a fine.

02:13.389 --> 02:14.857
Well, I'm not Stan.

02:14.889 --> 02:16.858
Jesus. "Stan never gave me a fine.

02:16.891 --> 02:18.860
Stan used to let me
hunt without a license.

02:18.894 --> 02:20.462
Stan never used a Breathalyzer."

02:20.496 --> 02:21.697
Do I look like Stan?

02:21.729 --> 02:22.897
You know what? I don't see gender.

02:22.931 --> 02:24.367
I just see authority.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.436
Get out of here.

02:27.502 --> 02:29.004
The sign of the beast.

02:29.038 --> 02:30.673
It predicts his coming.

02:30.705 --> 02:33.675
- You really want this ticket.
- This is bat's eye in amber.

02:33.709 --> 02:35.777
Its pupils dilate
when the beast is near.

02:35.811 --> 02:37.313
Got out the pen.

02:37.346 --> 02:39.814
And these are the Sacred
Daggers of Mycenae.

02:39.847 --> 02:42.351
Only they can destroy him.

02:44.586 --> 02:45.855
I've seen those before.

02:45.888 --> 02:47.289
Really?

02:47.323 --> 02:48.557
Where'd you get these?

02:48.590 --> 02:50.359
Oh, you know, I found some, traded some.

02:50.391 --> 02:53.295
This I got from the Lady Who Knows.

02:53.329 --> 02:55.031
The Lady Who Knows?

02:55.063 --> 02:56.865
It's a gift.

02:56.899 --> 02:58.700
For you.

03:00.568 --> 03:02.337
Thank you?

03:02.371 --> 03:03.839
Can you give me something of yours?

03:03.871 --> 03:05.040
What?

03:05.074 --> 03:06.809
Do you have a whistle?

03:06.841 --> 03:09.544
Uh, yeah, but I need it.

03:09.578 --> 03:11.980
- Can I drive your car?
- No.

03:12.014 --> 03:13.482
What kind of gun is that?

03:13.514 --> 03:14.783
Enjoy the whistle.

03:15.818 --> 03:17.520
Awesome!

03:17.552 --> 03:18.920
I got a whistle!

03:20.788 --> 03:22.024
No, no.

03:22.056 --> 03:23.425
Please don't blow it.

03:23.459 --> 03:24.960
That's the sound I'm gonna make!

03:24.992 --> 03:27.530
It was just practice, but
that's what I'm gonna do!

03:32.033 --> 03:34.903
Trucks love the road,

03:34.937 --> 03:38.507
and the road loves trucks
when they're on it.

03:38.539 --> 03:40.976
But when ice comes between them...

03:41.008 --> 03:43.044
What the hell is this?

03:43.078 --> 03:44.447
Oh, good, you're up.

03:44.479 --> 03:46.014
I have a big day planned for us.

03:46.048 --> 03:48.384
What... what... what are you watching?

03:48.417 --> 03:49.652
"Danger Haul."

03:49.685 --> 03:51.687
It's a reality show about truckers.

03:51.720 --> 03:52.888
That's not a show.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.689
"I Dream of Jeannie" was a show.

03:54.722 --> 03:57.092
Guy finds a genie and
everybody goes apeshit.

03:57.126 --> 04:00.496
Especially that jackass Admiral Bellows.

04:02.563 --> 04:05.668
Big Roy's got a truck full of chili,

04:05.700 --> 04:07.569
but he's stuck on the ice.

04:07.603 --> 04:08.804
Sure as shooting, in the Army,

04:08.836 --> 04:10.405
they'd give him the black capsule.

04:10.438 --> 04:12.441
- The what?
- Black capsule, cyanide.

04:12.473 --> 04:14.042
The astronauts had 'em too.

04:14.075 --> 04:16.945
You get stuck in orbit
or captured by the enemy,

04:16.978 --> 04:18.947
you'd just bite into that thing

04:18.980 --> 04:21.416
and it's see ya soon, you big baboon.

04:21.449 --> 04:22.985
The astronauts had cyanide?

04:23.017 --> 04:24.552
They sure did.

04:24.586 --> 04:26.155
Yeah, they sewed it
right into their uniforms

04:26.187 --> 04:28.723
so they could, uh, have a
way out of a no-win situation.

04:28.757 --> 04:30.559
Yeah. Everybody has them.

04:30.591 --> 04:35.798
Astronauts, pilots,
people down at the bank.

04:35.831 --> 04:37.400
What do you want?

04:37.432 --> 04:39.033
I have a question.

04:39.067 --> 04:40.468
You couldn't call?

04:40.502 --> 04:41.537
You don't answer.

04:41.569 --> 04:42.904
That's a goddamn good system.

04:42.937 --> 04:44.572
Mm. Really?

04:44.605 --> 04:47.576
'Cause 171 falsely accused
witches want us dead.

04:47.608 --> 04:49.512
You don't want to keep
in some kind of touch?

04:49.545 --> 04:51.013
Psst! I'm retired.

04:51.045 --> 04:53.182
Hmm. And yet they don't seem to care.

04:53.214 --> 04:55.750
Hey, that, uh... that crazy guy

04:55.783 --> 04:57.452
who's always screaming
about the end times?

04:57.485 --> 04:58.486
What's his deal?

04:58.519 --> 04:59.889
Ray Taft?

04:59.922 --> 05:02.091
He's about as sharp as a bag of socks.

05:02.124 --> 05:04.126
Well, how come you never fined
him for disturbing the peace?

05:04.158 --> 05:05.661
I fined him one time.

05:05.694 --> 05:09.198
But word to the wise, if
you do fine him, you...

05:09.230 --> 05:12.435
you may not like what he uses for money.

05:12.468 --> 05:15.905
Well...

05:15.937 --> 05:16.906
oh, no.

05:16.939 --> 05:18.174
There you go.

05:19.675 --> 05:22.745
Damn it!

05:22.778 --> 05:25.614
Wha...

05:27.014 --> 05:28.483
They fell.

05:32.588 --> 05:35.925
Hey, uh, what are those?

05:35.958 --> 05:37.059
The salad thingies?

05:37.091 --> 05:38.461
Those are Mom's.

05:38.493 --> 05:39.928
She never let us take 'em down.

05:39.961 --> 05:41.096
Not that we would ever use them.

05:41.129 --> 05:43.499
No salad is that big.

05:49.704 --> 05:51.574
- Here.
- What?

05:51.606 --> 05:53.508
I told you I had big plans for us today.

05:53.541 --> 05:54.742
Holding a bucket?

05:54.776 --> 05:56.245
No. We're going blueberry picking.

05:56.278 --> 05:57.947
- Oh, no, we're not.
- Pops.

05:57.980 --> 06:00.149
Evie, tell him to go
blueberry picking with me.

06:00.182 --> 06:02.151
Oh, I think that... that might be, like,

06:02.184 --> 06:03.586
a thing between you and your dad.

06:03.618 --> 06:05.086
Where's your whistle?

06:05.120 --> 06:06.721
My dad always wore a whistle.

06:06.754 --> 06:08.891
First of all, I'm not your...

06:08.923 --> 06:10.625
Where is your father?

06:10.658 --> 06:12.060
Oh, he did it again.

06:12.093 --> 06:13.795
Whenever I ask him to
go blueberry picking,

06:13.829 --> 06:15.264
he always hides. I have half a mind

06:15.297 --> 06:17.733
to just go blueberry picking by myself!

06:17.766 --> 06:20.169
You know, it has been done before.

06:20.201 --> 06:21.637
Just saying.

06:23.271 --> 06:24.973
I think I will.

06:25.007 --> 06:26.509
Huh.

06:37.718 --> 06:40.589
♪ Berries, don't be blue ♪

06:40.622 --> 06:43.259
♪ I won't leave you
hanging, no, I'll pick you ♪

06:43.291 --> 06:46.262
♪ Fill my bucket with your tasty goo ♪

06:46.295 --> 06:48.564
♪ Doo boo be doo ♪

06:55.137 --> 06:57.639
Hello there.

06:57.673 --> 07:00.675
So I said, "Fine. I'll go
blueberry picking alone."

07:00.709 --> 07:04.547
But I'm not alone! I met you!

07:04.579 --> 07:06.180
You're awfully quiet.

07:06.214 --> 07:07.916
Do you live out here?

07:07.949 --> 07:10.084
Do you want to see where I live?

07:11.353 --> 07:13.021
I want my dad to meet you.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.790
I want him to see what a real

07:14.822 --> 07:17.058
blueberry-picking partner looks like.

07:17.091 --> 07:20.128
He used to be sheriff of this town.

07:20.161 --> 07:26.701
But ever since he's retired,
he's just become impossible.

07:28.903 --> 07:30.605
Come on, goat.

07:32.942 --> 07:35.653
How much money do you need to
actually get here from Russia?

07:35.719 --> 07:37.136
- Hey.
- No.

07:37.184 --> 07:39.019
Mika, I don't want to
talk to your brother.

07:39.051 --> 07:40.487
Every time I talk to your brother,

07:40.521 --> 07:41.857
it's a different guy.

07:41.857 --> 07:43.525
Yes, I'll hold.

07:43.590 --> 07:45.192
Raymond Taft.

07:45.708 --> 07:47.377
Oh, whatever you do, don't fine him,

07:47.410 --> 07:48.445
unless you want a bag of human sh...

07:48.478 --> 07:50.035
Does he live anywhere?

07:50.036 --> 07:52.971
I think he squats in a
shack down by the lake.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.207
Yeah. Yeah, Mika.

07:55.241 --> 07:56.976
Da.

07:58.209 --> 07:59.178
Okay.

07:59.210 --> 08:01.897
"Green cargo container."

08:29.375 --> 08:31.209
Uh...

08:31.243 --> 08:32.744
hello...

08:32.777 --> 08:35.280
Ugh! Hello?

08:37.916 --> 08:39.818
Good God.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.621
Ugh.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.324
Oh, Jesus.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.308
Raymond Taft?

09:02.074 --> 09:04.277
I'm, um, sorry?

09:04.310 --> 09:05.911
Raymond Taft?

09:05.945 --> 09:07.647
Oh, yeah.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.614
Of course.

09:08.647 --> 09:10.215
It's been so long since
I heard my own name,

09:10.248 --> 09:11.917
I almost forgot.

09:11.950 --> 09:12.951
Huh.

09:12.984 --> 09:14.119
What do you want?

09:14.152 --> 09:17.190
I need to speak with you about these.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.394
Oh, my God.

09:21.426 --> 09:23.329
Where did you find those?

09:23.362 --> 09:24.897
Claire Miller's house.

09:24.930 --> 09:28.267
Uh, she was the Lady Who Knows.

09:28.300 --> 09:31.204
But she passed away, and, uh,

09:31.237 --> 09:34.907
I really need to speak with you.

09:34.940 --> 09:36.642
But you did take the hamster

09:36.676 --> 09:38.110
from the store without paying for it.

09:38.143 --> 09:40.212
Dad? You home?

09:40.246 --> 09:41.714
Yeah.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.750
Quite a haul, huh?

09:43.782 --> 09:46.719
Oh, sweetheart. Did
you go picking berries?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.286
Denise, honey, you've got to tell me

09:48.320 --> 09:50.022
next time you're gonna go pick berries.

09:50.056 --> 09:51.290
You understand there's
nothing more in the world

09:51.323 --> 09:54.995
I want to do than go
pick berries with you.

09:57.830 --> 10:00.666
But I thought that...

10:03.134 --> 10:05.871
Anyways, I met a friend.

10:05.905 --> 10:07.339
A friend?

10:07.373 --> 10:08.407
Yeah.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.676
I brought him home for you to meet.

10:10.709 --> 10:11.777
He's waiting on the porch.

10:11.810 --> 10:14.247
On the porch?

10:14.280 --> 10:16.786
A kid today with the manners
to wait out on the porch?

10:16.787 --> 10:17.754
He can't be a Millennial.

10:17.787 --> 10:20.791
They're the problem. You
know, too much praise.

10:20.823 --> 10:23.760
Nobody ever told 'em they
suck, and believe you me,

10:23.793 --> 10:25.395
kids need to know they suck.

10:25.428 --> 10:26.863
Let's go have a...

10:26.897 --> 10:29.566
Let's go have a meet and
greet with this mystery guest.

10:32.702 --> 10:34.704
Did I suck?

10:38.741 --> 10:40.743
Hello, young...

10:42.513 --> 10:45.382
Jesus!

10:47.750 --> 10:50.220
Denise!

10:50.687 --> 10:53.389
Is this who you went
picking berries with?

10:53.422 --> 10:56.126
No! He seemed like a cute little goat!

10:56.159 --> 10:58.528
Oh, don't they all!

10:58.562 --> 11:00.230
Oh!

11:01.565 --> 11:02.700
What's happening?

11:02.733 --> 11:04.118
Sweetheart, we're under siege,

11:04.118 --> 11:05.487
like Michael Caine in "Zulu."

11:05.521 --> 11:07.155
Here's what I want you to do.

11:07.189 --> 11:08.591
Get low and check all the windows.

11:08.623 --> 11:10.425
I'll go get the back door.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.328
Hmm. We're gonna need
the black capsules.

11:13.362 --> 11:16.165
I can feel it in my bones.

11:16.198 --> 11:18.300
I'm sorry, I did not... I
didn't have time to clean.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.602
Uh...

11:20.636 --> 11:21.469
Here?

11:21.502 --> 11:24.105
Yeah.

11:24.139 --> 11:25.308
- Sorry.
- Oh, no, no, no.

11:25.332 --> 11:27.968
It's, uh... it's real nice. Real homey.

11:28.010 --> 11:28.542
Thank you.

11:28.542 --> 11:29.476
I would, you know,

11:29.509 --> 11:33.213
get rid of that raccoon
before it gives birth.

11:33.247 --> 11:35.431
So the Lady Who Knows is gone.

11:35.478 --> 11:37.848
Yeah, yeah. She, um... she passed away.

11:37.881 --> 11:40.284
What... what did you know about her?

11:40.316 --> 11:41.317
She hunted demons.

11:41.351 --> 11:43.120
I used to live in the park,

11:43.152 --> 11:44.353
and I've seen all sorts of things...

11:44.386 --> 11:48.092
haints, Gorgons, poltergeists.

11:48.125 --> 11:49.026
You want some?

11:49.059 --> 11:49.927
I'm good.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.060
This whole town's haunted.

11:51.093 --> 11:52.729
It's 'cause of the witch burnings.

11:52.762 --> 11:54.363
Of course, they weren't really witches.

11:54.786 --> 11:56.455
Yeah, I've heard that, uh, that story.

11:56.488 --> 11:59.526
Why are they haunting us?
I mean, what do they want?

11:59.559 --> 12:01.560
I think they want all
the constables dead.

12:01.594 --> 12:03.430
And they got them all, too,
except for Sheriff Miller.

12:03.463 --> 12:05.632
That's 'cause the Lady Who
Knows was protecting him.

12:05.665 --> 12:08.300
But now she's gone and
you two are still alive,

12:08.334 --> 12:10.337
for now.

12:10.369 --> 12:11.871
How do I stop it?

12:12.906 --> 12:14.641
What do you think I
scream about every morning?

12:14.674 --> 12:15.709
That's the thing. You know,

12:15.742 --> 12:17.611
sometimes I feel like
people aren't even listening.

12:17.643 --> 12:19.178
Could you try not screaming?

12:19.212 --> 12:20.095
I don't know.

12:20.096 --> 12:21.782
That doesn't seem natural.

12:23.833 --> 12:24.868
Okay.

12:27.369 --> 12:29.505
This town is evil.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.373
I'm sorry. I've really
got to let it rip.

12:31.407 --> 12:33.843
Okay. All right. Let's have it.

12:33.875 --> 12:35.210
It was Eccles!

12:35.243 --> 12:38.380
Thaddeus Eccles cursed this town!

12:38.413 --> 12:39.248
Does that work for you?

12:39.282 --> 12:41.216
- Great.
- Thaddeus Eccles,

12:41.249 --> 12:44.019
that godless son of a whore!

12:46.989 --> 12:47.757
He ain't really doing nothing.

12:47.790 --> 12:50.260
He's just kind of standing there.

12:50.292 --> 12:51.260
Dad, I swear when I met him,

12:51.293 --> 12:53.128
he was just a cute little goat.

12:53.162 --> 12:55.297
Let that be a lesson
to you there, missy.

12:55.330 --> 12:58.133
W-W-What do you mean, like
a lesson in goats or...

12:58.166 --> 13:01.537
or a more symbolic lesson
in first impressions?

13:01.570 --> 13:04.574
You're the one who didn't want
me to keep a gun in the house.

13:04.607 --> 13:06.976
Would a gun help in this situation?

13:07.008 --> 13:09.044
Well, we might need
to use it on ourselves.

13:09.078 --> 13:11.948
We... we don't have any
of the black capsules.

13:11.980 --> 13:15.150
Black capsules are your
answer for everything.

13:15.184 --> 13:17.153
Eh...

13:17.186 --> 13:19.055
Aah!

13:19.088 --> 13:20.390
Huh?

13:22.925 --> 13:26.296
Dad.

13:26.329 --> 13:27.430
What's happening?

13:27.463 --> 13:28.565
Dad, are you okay?

13:30.166 --> 13:31.401
Dad?

13:34.269 --> 13:35.504
Aaaaah!

13:35.537 --> 13:38.007
No false god can save you.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.209
I'm gonna stop you right there.

13:39.242 --> 13:40.142
Okay.

13:40.176 --> 13:41.477
Who or what is the beast?

13:41.509 --> 13:44.446
Of course. Um... the Baphomet,

13:44.479 --> 13:46.014
the harbinger of the dark veil.

13:46.047 --> 13:47.015
He is a trickster.

13:47.282 --> 13:48.684
- Uh-huh.
- Very deceitful.

13:48.796 --> 13:52.522
Okay, okay, and then,
uh... these, uh, "daggers."

13:52.555 --> 13:54.324
That's gonna kill him, right?

13:54.357 --> 13:55.458
Yeah.

13:55.490 --> 13:58.327
But I must warn you,

13:58.360 --> 14:01.931
he is everywhere.

14:01.964 --> 14:03.266
Thank you.

14:03.298 --> 14:05.033
You're welcome.

14:10.568 --> 14:12.337
Dad?

14:18.654 --> 14:19.922
Oh, hi, hon.

14:19.955 --> 14:21.557
Wait a minute.

14:21.590 --> 14:24.493
Are you you?

14:25.059 --> 14:27.029
Yep.

14:27.062 --> 14:28.464
Oh, my God.

14:28.496 --> 14:31.699
How, uh... how long was I out?

14:31.732 --> 14:33.268
I don't know.

14:33.302 --> 14:34.903
A few minutes.

14:34.936 --> 14:38.440
Like, microwave popcorn amount of time.

14:38.472 --> 14:40.341
Yeah?

14:40.375 --> 14:41.777
Well, if I was only out a few minutes,

14:41.809 --> 14:43.279
how come it's already dark out?

14:43.312 --> 14:46.347
It... it isn't even 4:00 yet.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.949
Oh.

14:47.982 --> 14:49.751
It's his doing.

14:49.784 --> 14:52.587
He made it nighttime
just over our house?

14:52.620 --> 14:55.823
Oh, that's weird.

14:55.856 --> 14:58.394
He's still out there,
and we're stuck in here.

14:58.427 --> 14:59.795
This ain't "Zulu."

14:59.827 --> 15:00.928
No, no, no, no, no.

15:00.961 --> 15:02.764
This is "Jaws."

15:02.798 --> 15:03.666
We're trapped in here

15:03.698 --> 15:07.435
while he goes around
and around and around.

15:07.468 --> 15:10.471
Yeah, this is "Jaws," and I'm Brody.

15:10.505 --> 15:12.674
I want to be Brody.

15:12.707 --> 15:15.077
You can't be Brody. You're Hooper.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.546
I don't want to be
Hooper. I want to be Quint.

15:17.578 --> 15:19.066
You can't be Quint. Quint dies. Come on.

15:19.067 --> 15:19.647
Fine, fine.

15:19.681 --> 15:20.615
Then I'll be... I'll be...

15:20.649 --> 15:22.518
What's the name of that
girl in "King Kong"?

15:22.551 --> 15:24.086
This isn't "King Kong."

15:24.119 --> 15:25.954
It's "Jaws."

15:25.986 --> 15:28.022
Now, this is all your mother's fault.

15:28.056 --> 15:29.825
Mark my word.

15:29.857 --> 15:31.859
Hmm. Thanks, Claire.

15:31.893 --> 15:34.463
Thanks a million.

15:34.495 --> 15:36.398
Well, thank you so much.

15:36.431 --> 15:37.466
I really appreciate it.

15:37.499 --> 15:38.233
Oh, no, no, no, no. You
can't go. You can't go.

15:38.265 --> 15:39.702
I have so much more to tell you.

15:39.735 --> 15:41.603
Okay, I-I-I think I get it

15:41.635 --> 15:43.038
and I need to warn my friends, so...

15:43.071 --> 15:45.608
- Oh. Of course.
- Yeah.

15:51.545 --> 15:53.448
Ray?

15:55.049 --> 15:56.751
Give me one moment.

15:58.419 --> 15:59.889
Thank you.

16:03.658 --> 16:05.427
I'm just gonna let myself out.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.096
Oh!

16:07.662 --> 16:08.463
I'm sorry.

16:08.495 --> 16:09.997
I'm really sorry.

16:10.030 --> 16:12.633
Very sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.069
Sorry.

16:23.979 --> 16:25.581
Sorry.

16:30.718 --> 16:34.155
If this is "Jaws," why
don't we just blow it up?

16:34.188 --> 16:35.990
Oh, that's not "Jaws."
That's "Star Wars."

16:36.024 --> 16:38.126
It's also "Jaws." In
fact, it's everything.

16:38.159 --> 16:40.028
Everybody blows up
everything in everything.

16:40.061 --> 16:42.832
It's why people go to the movies.

16:45.634 --> 16:48.803
"Jaws" had an air tank.

16:48.836 --> 16:51.874
Do we have a fire extinguisher?

16:51.907 --> 16:54.009
We have a hose.

16:57.611 --> 16:59.680
Well... wait a minute.

17:41.857 --> 17:42.891
Great.

17:55.169 --> 17:57.505
Bingo, baby.

18:13.755 --> 18:15.056
Stop!

18:17.258 --> 18:18.059
Out of the car, please.

18:18.092 --> 18:19.260
I've got to commandeer your vehicle.

18:19.293 --> 18:20.728
Stan never commandeered my car.

18:20.762 --> 18:22.063
Get out!

18:22.097 --> 18:23.999
"Oh, Stan never commandeered my car."

18:24.032 --> 18:25.868
Stan this, Stan that.

18:25.900 --> 18:27.068
I can't stand it!

18:27.101 --> 18:29.737
Huh, that's... actually funny.

18:50.225 --> 18:51.159
Oh!

19:04.104 --> 19:05.507
Here. Have this.

19:21.822 --> 19:23.257
Smile, you son of a bitch.

19:25.060 --> 19:27.262
Oh, shit.

19:33.851 --> 19:35.055
Master.

19:35.056 --> 19:37.458
Master, behold.

19:48.389 --> 19:49.970
Freeze!

19:50.087 --> 19:52.023
Evie, you remember "Jaws"?

19:52.056 --> 19:53.224
Which part?

19:53.257 --> 19:55.861
Come on, figure it out!

19:58.929 --> 19:59.898
Smile, you son of a...

19:59.930 --> 20:01.866
- I already said that.
- Well, I want to say it, too.

20:03.267 --> 20:04.435
Smile, you son of a...

20:07.439 --> 20:09.874
Mother...

20:09.908 --> 20:11.243
Nice shot, Annie Oakley.

20:14.813 --> 20:16.982
Smile, you stupid man!

20:17.015 --> 20:20.719
Aaaaah!

20:26.190 --> 20:28.326
I told you I was Brody!

20:28.360 --> 20:30.996
Damn it.

20:33.364 --> 20:35.833
Hey!

20:35.866 --> 20:37.335
Good work, team.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.107
For Christ's sake.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.281
Next time, just ask.

20:54.385 --> 20:58.556
I keep getting the feeling
we're forgetting something.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.959
No. No, I don't think so.

21:02.928 --> 21:03.781
Hmm.

21:11.836 --> 21:13.037
I feel awful.
