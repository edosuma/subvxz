00:45.745 --> 00:50.816
- Once upon a time i
served a great king.

00:51.151 --> 00:54.186
I served him like no other.

00:54.320 --> 00:55.788
After many years
of service to him,

00:55.790 --> 00:58.123
by his grace and generosity,

00:58.125 --> 01:03.362
he allowed me in the company
of his highest court,

01:03.364 --> 01:06.398
amongst his most devout.

01:06.533 --> 01:10.803
You could say i
was favored by him.

01:12.306 --> 01:16.508
But the lands of his
kingdom were not in peace.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.645
It became filled
with insubordination.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.547
They became too smart
for their own good

01:21.549 --> 01:26.118
and tried to break free
of the king's covenant.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.253
And because he knew
my love for him

01:28.255 --> 01:31.857
and favored me above the others,

01:32.192 --> 01:36.195
it was me he appointed
to fix things.

01:36.329 --> 01:39.665
Cleanse the land.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.701
He was the most benevolent king

01:42.703 --> 01:46.371
and I was his majesty's knight,

01:46.506 --> 01:48.774
his loyal servant,

01:49.242 --> 01:51.677
his willing slave.

01:52.112 --> 01:55.514
Nothing and no one
rivaled my love for him.

01:55.516 --> 01:58.250
With all the power
he entrusted to me,

01:58.252 --> 02:01.753
I fought war upon war upon war

02:02.689 --> 02:06.191
to restore balance
to his kingdom.

02:08.829 --> 02:12.131
- And what happened next?

02:12.265 --> 02:15.234
- Everything was made right.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.812
- Cleanse?

02:26.814 --> 02:30.315
Did you have to hurt anyone?

02:33.853 --> 02:35.921
- I'm afraid I had to.

02:39.859 --> 02:42.628
- Was the king happy?

02:42.630 --> 02:44.396
- Very.

02:44.531 --> 02:48.233
He made me a guardian
of his kingdom.

02:51.638 --> 02:54.373
Once upon a time ago.

02:54.908 --> 02:56.875
- You don't look that old.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.677
When did all of it happen?

02:58.679 --> 03:03.916
- Well before you
stumbled into this world.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.818
I'm older than I look.

03:08.321 --> 03:10.355
- You seem sad.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.227
I've never seen you before.

03:15.229 --> 03:16.662
Are you from here?

03:16.664 --> 03:19.298
- No, I live near the water.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.633
I'm here to check up on someone.

03:21.635 --> 03:22.668
Friends.

03:22.670 --> 03:26.338
- And then you're going
back to where you live?

03:26.340 --> 03:27.973
To the king?

03:28.708 --> 03:30.676
- Soon enough.

03:30.810 --> 03:34.279
I haven't seen him
for quite some time.

03:34.281 --> 03:36.248
- Why?

03:39.553 --> 03:42.588
- We had a disagreement.

03:43.790 --> 03:46.325
- You got in a fight?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.459
- No.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.994
I could never fight him.

03:48.996 --> 03:53.265
- Then why can't
you go back to him?

03:53.267 --> 03:58.637
- Well, sometimes when
you're asked to do something

03:58.639 --> 04:00.472
you can't do it.

04:00.474 --> 04:03.308
Not out of disrespect,

04:03.310 --> 04:05.377
but out of love.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.381
- I don't understand.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.419
- Have you ever lied

04:14.421 --> 04:17.856
because you were afraid
to upset someone?

04:22.962 --> 04:26.965
A lot like the story
of Jack and Jill.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.567
Do you know that story?

04:28.569 --> 04:31.303
- Everyone knows that story.

04:31.305 --> 04:33.472
- Not the make-believe one.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.942
I'm talking about
the real story.

04:40.380 --> 04:43.615
Would you like to hear it?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.729
- Jill, are you okay?

05:37.770 --> 05:40.939
- Jack, you gotta phone call!

05:52.885 --> 05:53.885
- This is Jack.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.721
I know who it is!

05:55.723 --> 05:57.823
Time's up Jack!

05:57.957 --> 05:59.958
- Jill, your nose is bleeding.

05:59.960 --> 06:00.892
- What?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.094
- Take this.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.061
- Oh my god.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.496
- Put your head back.

06:04.498 --> 06:08.900
- You knew
the terms. You signed it.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.435
- I don't have the money.

06:10.437 --> 06:12.003
- What
about your new wife?

06:12.005 --> 06:16.775
I hear she's doing
better than you are.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.678
You thought we
fell asleep on you.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.979
- But that was his past.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.614
You said that he
treats you well.

06:22.616 --> 06:27.419
I don't see what you're
so worried about.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.421
- I don't know.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.423
I can't place it.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.726
There's something
he's not telling me.

06:38.898 --> 06:41.566
- You could start by
going through his garbage,

06:41.568 --> 06:43.502
seeing what he's
spending his money on.

06:43.504 --> 06:49.074
Guys aren't very good at
keeping their receipts.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.195
- And then?

07:11.564 --> 07:13.598
- I don't know.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.136
It could go in many
different ways.

07:18.138 --> 07:22.541
- You mean you
don't know the rest?

07:22.675 --> 07:24.576
- I can only hope.

07:24.578 --> 07:28.713
- So it hasn't happened yet.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.451
- You're very clever.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.953
Karin.

07:36.189 --> 07:38.757
That's your name isn't it?

07:38.759 --> 07:40.459
- Yes.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.862
- Do you love your
mom more or your dad?

07:46.599 --> 07:48.533
Is it your mom?

07:50.937 --> 07:54.105
Why do you love her more?

07:54.240 --> 07:57.008
- Because she's in heaven.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.947
- I'm sorry to hear that.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.885
And where is your father?

08:06.887 --> 08:10.155
- I only know what they told me.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.924
- And what was that?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.593
- That he was so
sad when mom died

08:14.595 --> 08:18.163
that he got angry
and went to jail.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.599
- Angry?

08:20.601 --> 08:22.567
Angry at who?

08:25.137 --> 08:26.838
God?

08:31.010 --> 08:35.881
What if I told you
god is a fairy tale?

08:36.282 --> 08:39.049
Just like Santa claus.

08:42.722 --> 08:46.224
Just like you learned
that Santa wasn't real,

08:46.226 --> 08:49.928
you soon realize neither is...

08:49.930 --> 08:51.696
God.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.866
- Tell me your other story.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.203
- Have you heard the
story of the king,

08:58.205 --> 09:01.306
the beggar, and the priest?

09:14.186 --> 09:16.721
- Melanie, can you
check on our accountant?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.957
Let him know if he's not
here in the next two minutes,

09:18.959 --> 09:23.328
he's going to have to
calculate his own pay cut.

09:30.970 --> 09:34.940
- Mr. vaugn, we're
losing money rapidly.

09:34.942 --> 09:38.643
- That's not what you
told me in February.

09:38.645 --> 09:39.844
- I gave you a prediction

09:39.846 --> 09:41.813
based on the revenue
that we made that month,

09:41.815 --> 09:44.716
and that's because you
rushed me to give it to you.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.184
I had no idea we
were going to lose

09:46.186 --> 09:47.919
two major clients
over a zoning issue

09:47.921 --> 09:49.020
and neither did you.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.889
- Look, I've promised
myself and my wife

09:50.891 --> 09:54.125
that I'm going to have this
yacht for my birthday gift.

09:54.127 --> 09:57.696
And I'm not holding
off again for some...

10:05.905 --> 10:08.974
How much are we paying Melanie?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.809
- Melanie?

10:11.277 --> 10:13.712
Not nearly enough.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.315
- Maybe we need
someone a little more

10:17.317 --> 10:20.885
appetizing for our clients.

10:23.789 --> 10:27.258
- I don't know
what's come over me.

10:27.260 --> 10:30.996
- Trust in the lord my child.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.203
- I love being with other men.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.776
I get excited when my
husband doesn't know.

10:47.413 --> 10:50.915
I constantly
fantasize about them

10:50.917 --> 10:54.019
and I play scenarios in my head.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.755
- With all due
respect Mr. vaugn,

10:56.757 --> 10:58.757
I don't know how you're
going to manage that.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.326
Now there's no way around
this, it's clear math.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.195
Or, it will hinder productivity

11:04.197 --> 11:08.433
but we can cut
workers and salaries.

11:12.805 --> 11:14.439
- How many?

11:14.774 --> 11:20.145
- So you seek other men
because he ignores you?

11:20.746 --> 11:22.313
- No.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.450
Because I like it.

11:29.255 --> 11:33.291
I even fantasize
about you, father,

11:33.293 --> 11:36.194
every time I come here.

11:37.196 --> 11:42.267
All the things that we
could do inside these rooms.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.076
I'm sorry.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.143
I have to go.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.244
Please forgive me.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.013
- God, the father of mercies,

11:55.015 --> 11:57.148
through the death and
resurrection of his son

11:57.150 --> 11:59.718
has reconciled the
world to himself...

12:02.988 --> 12:08.493
And sent the holy spirit among
us to forgive us of our sins.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.449
- That's it?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.951
There has to be more.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.187
- There will be.

13:09.955 --> 13:14.826
- I'm not sure I should
be hearing these stories.

13:21.967 --> 13:24.869
- Karen, I'm leaving now.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.838
It was a pleasure meeting you.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.108
Give our conversation
some thought.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.143
You're a smart girl.

13:32.145 --> 13:36.047
Perhaps too smart
for your own good.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.417
Maybe even for fairy tales.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.120
- Too smart for my own good?

13:42.122 --> 13:43.188
- Yes.

13:43.190 --> 13:47.425
Like the people who
broke the king's rules?

13:54.366 --> 13:55.266
- Karin!

13:55.268 --> 13:57.135
Do you realize I almost
called the police?!

13:57.137 --> 13:59.904
Didn't you hear us
shouting your name?!

13:59.906 --> 14:02.006
What are you doing out here?!

14:02.008 --> 14:03.908
- I didn't want to stay inside.

14:03.910 --> 14:07.979
Dasjia, please go tell Ms.
Jacobs that we found her.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.514
Karin, just because
we are not your family

14:09.516 --> 14:13.251
does not mean you can run off
whenever you feel like it.

14:13.253 --> 14:17.856
This is your home.
Do you understand?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.490
Let's go.

14:24.063 --> 14:27.031
Who were you talking to?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.335
Yourself, again.

14:39.913 --> 14:40.578
- Hey.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.914
Haven't seen you in some time.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.216
Must have got a new
car or something.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.985
You stopped visiting.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.920
- Not really, just a long day.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.121
Long walk over.

14:50.123 --> 14:50.989
- Ouch.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.957
Well, I guess I'll just
have to screw with your car

14:52.959 --> 14:55.593
to get you to come
in more often.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.401
- See you around.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.570
- See ya.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.704
- Saint Michael's is a
decommissioned monastery

16:46.706 --> 16:49.140
that houses us in solitude

16:49.142 --> 16:52.710
should these situations arise.

16:53.445 --> 16:57.582
You want me to Grant
you a sabbatical.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.250
- Yes.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.785
- And what would a
leave of absence do

17:00.787 --> 17:04.655
for someone as loved
here as you are?

17:04.656 --> 17:06.758
- I don't know.

17:07.092 --> 17:09.227
I don't have the answers.

17:09.229 --> 17:11.329
Do you think it's that simple?!

17:11.330 --> 17:12.430
I rushed into this!

17:12.432 --> 17:14.398
I can't keep all
these thoughts inside!

17:14.401 --> 17:18.169
I don't even want
to be here anymore!

17:41.627 --> 17:43.594
I don't know.

17:44.129 --> 17:46.831
I just need some time.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.100
- This is normal.

17:49.102 --> 17:53.704
No man of the clergy
is free from this test.

17:55.574 --> 17:59.143
Clear your conscience my son.

17:59.278 --> 18:03.414
It is not a sin unless
it is acted upon.

18:08.087 --> 18:13.124
- That's what I cannot
guarantee, your excellency.

18:19.832 --> 18:23.167
- How long will you need?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.638
- Three months?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.275
- When do you wish to leave?

18:31.277 --> 18:33.111
- Immediately.

18:33.245 --> 18:34.879
- It is best that you
stay out of the public eye

18:34.881 --> 18:36.280
until you are ready to return.

18:36.282 --> 18:39.450
Your reputation here is
nothing less than perfect,

18:39.452 --> 18:42.220
and I intend to
keep it that way.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.790
I can have Saint
Michael's prepared for
you by this evening,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.493
and a driver who will take you.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.128
It's a long drive,

18:50.130 --> 18:54.499
but I'll make sure they
leave a light on for you.

18:54.501 --> 18:57.902
- Thank you, your excellency.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.305
I'm indebted to you.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.407
- Joseph.

19:05.878 --> 19:09.814
Solitude can only
take you so far.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.217
- Uh-uh. You don't
want to do that.

19:46.219 --> 19:48.753
You about to get caught
up and locked down.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.189
No doubt about it.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.728
If you want to get
out of this rut

19:57.730 --> 20:02.366
you're going to have to do
a lot more work than that.

20:33.498 --> 20:34.865
- You can take this out.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.734
- What happened?

20:36.736 --> 20:39.437
- It was standing
up waiting for you.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.771
It got tired.

20:40.773 --> 20:42.607
- I got it.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.009
Here.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.615
- Dinner's on the table.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.984
If you feel like it.

21:16.475 --> 21:18.709
- Wise decision.

21:19.544 --> 21:21.912
- How do you know that?

21:21.914 --> 21:25.583
- I've been around long enough.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.644
If you want to get
off these streets,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.746
there is a way,

21:55.981 --> 21:58.816
but it will take a little work.

21:58.818 --> 22:01.752
- Man, you know I can't work.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.621
- It ain't that kinda work.

22:03.623 --> 22:06.857
- What kind of work is it?

22:07.092 --> 22:08.526
- It's the kind of work

22:08.528 --> 22:14.565
that'll make you never have
to sit on the curb again.

22:15.367 --> 22:18.102
But it takes courage.

22:19.638 --> 22:25.443
- Well if it's like that,
how come you ain't doing it?

22:25.445 --> 22:28.012
- I don't have that
kind of courage.

22:28.014 --> 22:31.015
- How do you know about it?

22:31.017 --> 22:34.552
- I knew somebody who tried.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.555
- What happened to him?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.523
- Don't know.

22:40.992 --> 22:43.527
Some say they saw him

22:43.529 --> 22:46.731
get into a limousine once.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.635
Others say they found him dead,

22:51.637 --> 22:54.672
face down on the street.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.811
Now, I can show you how--

23:01.880 --> 23:06.717
- but it's about
having enough courage.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.619
- Yes.

23:09.855 --> 23:11.622
Do you?

25:55.687 --> 25:58.656
- So this is where
you squat, huh?

25:58.658 --> 26:00.324
- Sometimes.

26:01.626 --> 26:05.829
I like staying
close to the harbor.

26:05.997 --> 26:08.265
Good air currents.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.702
Keeps the place from
smelling like shit,

26:11.704 --> 26:13.337
even your own.

26:15.774 --> 26:16.974
That's a good boy.

26:16.976 --> 26:21.712
Governor's been a
little agitated today.

26:21.714 --> 26:22.680
- Governor?

26:22.682 --> 26:24.281
What you talking, man?

26:24.283 --> 26:27.985
- Yeah, that's him right here.

26:28.119 --> 26:31.722
He's been having issues
with the mayor all week.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.791
Ain't that right mister mayor?

26:35.595 --> 26:38.329
But he gonna get his.

26:38.663 --> 26:43.601
Mister governor, he'll
get what's coming to him.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.376
- So what do I got to do?

26:55.614 --> 26:56.814
- That's not what I said.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.115
Stop putting words in my mouth.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.216
- You are such a liar.

26:59.218 --> 27:01.085
I should have known
better than to trust you.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.920
- You're just upset
because I got laid off.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.655
You might have to pick
up a few more shifts.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.890
It's not like I'm not out there
everyday looking for work,

27:06.892 --> 27:08.158
trying to find side jobs.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.893
It's always the
bottom line with you.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.095
"Where's the money Jack?"

27:11.097 --> 27:12.796
- Oh yeah! No that's
really spot on!

27:12.798 --> 27:15.899
You really know
your wife very well!

27:15.901 --> 27:17.901
I'm not surprised your
first marriage broke down.

27:17.903 --> 27:19.169
- Don't turn this around on me.

27:19.171 --> 27:21.138
You don't know anything
about that part of my life.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.172
- Of course not!

27:22.174 --> 27:25.142
That's because you have to
hide everything from me.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.343
What was it the other day?

27:26.345 --> 27:29.246
You had to change your
phone number? Why?

27:29.248 --> 27:30.681
You don't have any friends.

27:30.683 --> 27:31.882
You don't have any family.

27:31.884 --> 27:33.817
Who are you trying
to get rid of?

27:33.819 --> 27:36.220
Tough to keep up with your
mistress and your wife huh?

27:36.222 --> 27:37.054
- What?

27:37.056 --> 27:39.023
- You just leave the house
and come back at midnight

27:39.025 --> 27:40.157
because you have to.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.392
Or you have to go to church.

27:41.394 --> 27:43.661
Who knows if that's even
where you're going?!

27:43.663 --> 27:45.929
But with your wife, you don't
have to be home on time,

27:45.931 --> 27:47.731
you don't have to spend
any time with her,

27:47.733 --> 27:48.866
have dinner with her.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.401
She's just always
here to come home to

27:50.403 --> 27:53.103
and listen to your
stupid excuses!

29:00.505 --> 29:03.774
- Lacy, can you send
our accountant in here?

29:15.220 --> 29:18.822
How's your job hunt?

29:18.824 --> 29:20.023
- You would know, right?

29:20.025 --> 29:21.125
Why do you even ask?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.826
- Quit
wasting your time.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.194
You don't have any left.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.162
- Look, i--

29:25.164 --> 29:27.364
- I'll
give you an opportunity

29:27.366 --> 29:32.069
to repay your debt in one night.

29:33.404 --> 29:36.073
I can only open the window.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.808
But it's you that's gonna have--

29:37.810 --> 29:40.177
- I won't kill anyone.

29:40.179 --> 29:44.014
- You're
not a murderer Jack.

29:44.016 --> 29:47.184
You have a skillset
that I require

29:47.186 --> 29:49.386
and that's all there is to it.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.256
I thought you wouldn't
mind this job too much

29:52.258 --> 29:56.293
considering who's on
the other end of it.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.463
- Remember,

29:59.898 --> 30:01.465
every night

30:01.467 --> 30:05.903
in the center of the
railroad tracks by the peer.

30:05.905 --> 30:07.905
- Yeah, for three weeks.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.139
- On the last Thursday

30:09.141 --> 30:12.976
you better have
your balls with you.

30:12.978 --> 30:13.944
Oh,

30:13.946 --> 30:17.381
and make sure you keep close

30:17.916 --> 30:20.117
what you're given.

30:20.119 --> 30:24.288
- I ain't been through
nothing I can't handle.

30:29.227 --> 30:31.962
- What you got there?

30:35.066 --> 30:38.302
You know how to read that?

30:39.237 --> 30:43.340
Then don't trust your
life to superstitions.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.976
You can't even
read that language.

30:45.978 --> 30:49.513
As a matter of fact,
if you rely on that,

30:49.515 --> 30:53.250
you'll end up like
the last fella.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.318
- What if I can't?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.154
- Then it's like
an untrained dog!

30:57.156 --> 30:59.289
Instead of serving you,

30:59.291 --> 31:02.025
you'll end up serving it.

31:02.027 --> 31:06.597
- Do I need
to repeat the instructions?

31:06.599 --> 31:07.564
- No. I got it.

31:07.566 --> 31:10.234
- I can't
offer you protection.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.903
You get caught, it's on you.

31:12.905 --> 31:17.140
However, there is something
that might help you on your way.

31:17.142 --> 31:20.477
You're going to have to
make a drive if you want it,

31:20.479 --> 31:24.381
but it'll keep
you out of danger.

31:24.383 --> 31:29.386
And remember, unless i
get the entire amount,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.421
your ass is mine.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.629
- Let's see where i
can squeeze you in.

31:39.264 --> 31:43.267
We do need someone
on the weekends but

31:43.269 --> 31:46.069
that'll be too
many hours for you.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.138
- I can pick up another 20.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.942
- On top of what
you're already working?

31:51.944 --> 31:54.578
That would be illegal.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.582
I've noticed that

31:58.584 --> 32:02.219
you and Jack have been having
a lot of problems lately

32:02.221 --> 32:07.224
and you've been bouncing
around from salon to salon.

32:07.226 --> 32:12.529
That's a shame he's got
you working this hard.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.433
- I don't like hearing no!

32:16.435 --> 32:17.301
- Well,

32:17.303 --> 32:21.138
you're either going to have to
hear it from me or the bank.

32:21.140 --> 32:22.973
The amount that we saved
on the salaries cut,

32:22.975 --> 32:25.575
it may provide enough cushion
for a couple of months

32:25.577 --> 32:29.379
but if I may speak
frankly, Mr. vaugn.

32:29.381 --> 32:31.715
- Go right ahead.

32:32.050 --> 32:36.019
- I'm a little surprised
by these decisions.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.489
I mean not just your financial
ones, but also in hr.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.291
- Stu,
sorry to disturb you.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.026
There's a Mr.
chuepak on the line.

32:43.028 --> 32:44.127
He says it's urgent.

32:44.129 --> 32:46.063
- Put him through.

32:56.407 --> 32:59.576
- You're killing me Jill.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.611
I'm not going to leave you alone

33:01.613 --> 33:03.113
until you tell me what's wrong.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.748
- I'm fine.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.218
- Do I look convinced?

33:22.667 --> 33:25.102
- I hate seeing him like this.

33:25.104 --> 33:28.038
On one side he is trying to
find us a way out of this mess.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.106
On the other side,

33:29.108 --> 33:32.776
he's just fixed
on something else.

33:36.381 --> 33:38.782
- Or someone else.

33:46.224 --> 33:48.492
And if that's the case,

33:48.494 --> 33:51.128
welcome to my world.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.132
- Yes, I know and I apologize.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.300
Melanie's been
out on sick leave.

33:57.302 --> 34:00.070
It's very unexpected.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.440
Well, let's rethink this.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.176
We may be even wasting
more time by removing

34:06.178 --> 34:07.177
the material.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.447
I know you said that we're
three weeks behind schedule.

34:10.449 --> 34:13.150
That can be made up simply
by adding a second team.

34:14.420 --> 34:15.685
Well we'll really have to see

34:15.687 --> 34:18.221
if this is a breach
of contract, David!

34:22.326 --> 34:24.094
- How will I know?

34:24.096 --> 34:25.695
- Well...

34:26.597 --> 34:27.697
The easy signs are

34:27.699 --> 34:31.435
if you smell a fragrance
on him that isn't yours,

34:31.437 --> 34:34.571
find hair on his clothes
that isn't yours,

34:34.572 --> 34:36.840
things in his pockets.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.509
The more general signs are

34:39.511 --> 34:42.079
him needing time and space away.

34:42.081 --> 34:47.117
Guys don't need that
much space for no reason.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.169
- How much money do I lose if I

36:12.171 --> 36:14.638
give back the boat.

36:20.611 --> 36:21.444
- Well,

36:21.446 --> 36:26.483
if you return the yacht
before the end of this week

36:26.485 --> 36:28.852
you would lose

36:30.321 --> 36:34.691
almost forty seven
thousand dollars.

36:34.859 --> 36:36.326
- My god.

36:52.577 --> 36:54.945
What should I do?

36:58.216 --> 36:59.716
- Well,

36:59.850 --> 37:03.220
considering the loss already.

37:03.222 --> 37:06.957
If you wanted to have
your birthday in Europe.

37:08.693 --> 37:12.229
And a yacht for your present.

37:13.598 --> 37:16.266
Don't let one client spoil it.

37:52.036 --> 37:54.804
- How did you find me?

37:55.273 --> 37:58.842
- I thought you might need me.

37:58.976 --> 38:02.479
- Did the bishop
tell you I was here?

38:03.881 --> 38:06.516
There's no place
for you to stay.

38:06.518 --> 38:07.751
It's not like it was before.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.452
I came here to be alone.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.321
- That's fine.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.023
- Last thing I need
is for someone to see

38:13.025 --> 38:16.026
a young boy and a priest out
in the middle of nowhere.

38:16.028 --> 38:19.796
- I got my own place to stay.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.766
I just need a place to eat.

38:22.967 --> 38:24.701
I can clean up like last time,

38:24.703 --> 38:29.372
replace the tiles,
fix what's broken

38:29.374 --> 38:31.074
for some soup?

38:31.442 --> 38:34.878
Looks like this place
needs a lot of work anyway.

38:38.883 --> 38:40.784
- Soup huh?

38:41.552 --> 38:43.086
- Yeah.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.726
- Of course, my son.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.928
Come inside.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.930
- Um.

38:56.901 --> 38:58.868
- Oh I forgot.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.005
Still afraid of chapels?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.473
- Sorry, sir.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.775
- It's all right.

39:05.777 --> 39:09.879
- Still can't shake
those bad memories.

39:10.881 --> 39:13.116
- You can eat out on the patio.

39:13.118 --> 39:15.618
I'll unlock the kitchen door.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.121
- Thank you, father.

40:45.476 --> 40:46.776
- Glory be to the father,

40:46.778 --> 40:49.546
and to the son, and
to the holy spirit,

40:49.548 --> 40:54.717
as it was in the beginning,
is now, and ever shall be.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.820
World without end.

43:11.288 --> 43:12.622
- Can I help you?

43:12.624 --> 43:15.992
- Is the confessional open?

43:16.260 --> 43:18.261
- This isn't a church.

43:18.263 --> 43:21.230
It's been years decommissioned.

43:21.232 --> 43:23.132
- I need to speak to someone.

43:23.134 --> 43:26.069
- I'm sure you can find someone.

43:26.071 --> 43:28.605
- Someone of faith.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.779
- We can speak

43:36.781 --> 43:38.748
on the porch.

44:14.752 --> 44:18.121
How long has it been since
your last confession?

44:18.123 --> 44:20.289
- Three days.

44:20.291 --> 44:23.192
- You are devout to the church.

44:23.194 --> 44:24.027
Go on.

44:24.029 --> 44:26.963
- I'm not here to
confess all my sins.

44:26.965 --> 44:30.833
That would be too heavy
of a door to open.

44:30.835 --> 44:36.906
- No sin is too heavy for
the mercy of our holy father.

44:36.908 --> 44:38.041
Go on.

44:38.043 --> 44:42.211
- I cursed god when
i lost my wife.

44:42.213 --> 44:43.880
She was killed by a drunk driver

44:43.882 --> 44:46.049
who wasn't brought to justice.

44:46.051 --> 44:50.019
I sought the man out,
and I murdered him,

44:50.021 --> 44:53.056
not believing in god's plan.

44:53.058 --> 44:57.226
I had a life sentence,
i should be in jail.

44:57.961 --> 44:59.996
- And through the mercy
of our holy father,

44:59.998 --> 45:02.699
your case was dismissed?

45:02.701 --> 45:04.367
- No.

45:05.402 --> 45:08.738
- How is it that you are here?

45:14.978 --> 45:19.882
- I don't know how he got in
my cell but he wasn't a dream.

45:19.884 --> 45:23.152
He was as real as the guards.

45:23.154 --> 45:25.455
Very calm.

45:25.457 --> 45:27.790
Civilized.

45:27.792 --> 45:29.292
At the time I didn't
care who he was.

45:29.294 --> 45:32.361
I saw a chance to be
free and I took it.

45:32.363 --> 45:34.297
It wasn't until
later that I realized

45:34.299 --> 45:38.501
what I might have
gotten involved with.

45:38.869 --> 45:44.140
I've remarried to a good woman
but I'm behind in my debt.

45:45.843 --> 45:51.013
I made a deal with something
i don't fully understand.

45:53.752 --> 45:55.885
- What kind of a deal?

45:55.887 --> 45:57.019
- An agreement.

45:57.021 --> 46:01.324
Sealed with a few
drops of my blood.

46:09.266 --> 46:11.267
Consorting with vile
people is a sin,

46:11.269 --> 46:14.170
but it can be forgiven
with prayers and--

46:14.172 --> 46:16.873
- I'm not sure they're people.

46:22.946 --> 46:24.847
- What do you mean?

46:24.849 --> 46:28.151
- They're always two
steps ahead of me.

46:31.054 --> 46:34.090
- What have you wagered?

46:41.431 --> 46:44.133
Your soul belongs
to the holy father

46:44.135 --> 46:45.935
so long as your
heart is with him.

46:45.937 --> 46:51.407
There is no pact that cannot
be broken by repentance.

46:51.409 --> 46:54.477
- I won't go back to prison.

46:54.479 --> 46:58.247
- You must trust in the
lord wherever he keeps you.

46:58.249 --> 47:02.552
- I'm not going
to the pen to die.

47:05.355 --> 47:09.959
I came to you father, I thought
the church was the answer.

47:14.431 --> 47:18.901
- I myself have newly
come to the cloth.

47:19.069 --> 47:20.336
I am no expert on this matter

47:20.338 --> 47:24.974
nor am I aware of what you've
become associated with.

47:24.976 --> 47:27.210
You've caught me

47:27.911 --> 47:30.446
at an awkward time.

47:32.115 --> 47:34.217
The advice I'm going to give
you must stay between us

47:34.219 --> 47:38.487
because it could put me at
jeopardy with the church.

47:41.124 --> 47:46.495
But I'm going to offer
it because I believe that

47:46.497 --> 47:50.099
god might see it differently.

47:53.503 --> 47:57.073
Perhaps the church
isn't the answer.

47:57.241 --> 48:00.209
Even though I'm a continual
student of our faith,

48:00.211 --> 48:05.214
I'm not so naive to believe
that we have all the answers.

48:08.352 --> 48:10.653
I have heard there is someone

48:10.655 --> 48:15.324
who deals with the realm of
the unseen in more detail.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.660
I have to tell you that
he's not of the cloth

48:17.662 --> 48:19.896
or of our faith.

48:22.633 --> 48:25.334
They say he's a wanderer

48:25.469 --> 48:27.536
living out east in the
desert somewhere near

48:27.538 --> 48:30.039
the Indian reservation.

48:30.041 --> 48:32.642
I don't know if it will
help or you'll even find him

48:32.644 --> 48:35.478
but it's all I can offer.

48:35.612 --> 48:40.516
For my part, for
your confession,

48:41.285 --> 48:43.920
you're forgiven.

48:45.255 --> 48:46.355
- Thank you father.

48:46.357 --> 48:50.359
You're the only one i
can trust right now.

48:50.361 --> 48:52.328
- Be at peace.

48:52.462 --> 48:54.263
Through the ministry
of the church

48:54.265 --> 48:56.699
may god pardon you.

48:57.134 --> 49:01.704
I absolve you of your
sins, on my part.

49:01.706 --> 49:05.341
In the name of the father,

49:05.343 --> 49:07.677
the son,

49:07.679 --> 49:09.545
and the holy spirit.

49:16.153 --> 49:17.720
Amen.

50:32.729 --> 50:37.500
- Now
listen carefully.

50:41.571 --> 50:44.807
- How do I know these
scrolls will protect me?

50:44.809 --> 50:48.077
- As
long as you do your job,

50:48.079 --> 50:50.446
they'll do theirs.

50:51.348 --> 50:53.315
- Hey, father?

50:54.084 --> 50:56.786
What's in that old rv?

50:57.421 --> 50:59.622
- That's a good question.

50:59.624 --> 51:00.756
I don't know exactly.

51:00.758 --> 51:03.692
Seems like it's been used
for storage over the years.

51:03.694 --> 51:07.096
- Is it filled with
bibles and such?

51:07.098 --> 51:08.564
- I don't know.

51:08.566 --> 51:12.101
Just seems like old
tables and furniture.

51:12.103 --> 51:15.604
- I can clean it out for you.

51:15.606 --> 51:18.340
- I thought you said
you had a place to stay.

51:18.342 --> 51:20.076
- I do.

51:20.210 --> 51:23.446
I just thought you might
want it cleaned up.

51:23.448 --> 51:25.481
I took a peek inside.

51:25.483 --> 51:28.250
No good keeping junk.

51:30.520 --> 51:33.489
- She's gonna clean me out.

51:33.491 --> 51:35.558
She's been working
on it for months.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.493
I can't believe I didn't see it.

51:37.495 --> 51:40.496
- You two have a
joint bank account?

51:40.498 --> 51:41.697
- We're married.

51:41.699 --> 51:43.265
Stupid question.

51:43.267 --> 51:46.802
- It may not be as
stupid as you think.

52:10.861 --> 52:12.161
- Argentina?

52:12.163 --> 52:13.529
- You would withdraw everything,

52:13.531 --> 52:15.397
minus the red herring
in your joint account,

52:15.399 --> 52:17.867
which of course you're
going to have to sacrifice

52:17.869 --> 52:19.668
and whatever you intend
to leave for her.

52:19.670 --> 52:21.370
- I'm not leaving
her one red penny

52:21.372 --> 52:23.172
more than I have to leave her!

52:23.174 --> 52:25.374
She can rot in hell as
far as I'm concerned.

52:25.376 --> 52:27.710
This is my money!

52:27.844 --> 52:29.845
- Then you'd want to do
this as fast as possible,

52:29.847 --> 52:31.514
as your wife and
her representation

52:31.516 --> 52:34.483
may have already grabbed a
snapshot of your financials.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.551
- Oh, they can't.

52:35.553 --> 52:37.887
I never allowed her to co-sign
on my business accounts

52:37.889 --> 52:39.822
or my personal accounts.

52:39.824 --> 52:41.657
- Good man.

52:41.858 --> 52:45.928
But the bank can
still give it to her.

52:45.930 --> 52:48.831
Happens all the time.

52:49.399 --> 52:52.334
You can't trust the bank.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.269
- Really?

52:53.271 --> 52:56.739
- Oh yeah. I've
learned that lesson.

52:56.741 --> 52:58.574
- This isn't my first rodeo.

52:58.576 --> 53:01.443
How soon do I make
the wire transfer?

53:01.445 --> 53:05.314
- Who said anything
about a wire transfer?

53:15.192 --> 53:16.225
- How did?

53:16.227 --> 53:17.393
- I work fast.

53:17.395 --> 53:20.329
I tried not to spare
things you can't use.

53:20.331 --> 53:22.731
Took them out to the dumpster.

53:22.733 --> 53:24.700
- By yourself?

53:24.834 --> 53:27.870
- I didn't want to
bother you, father.

53:27.872 --> 53:31.774
You've got important work to do.

53:32.943 --> 53:36.345
- Is there anything i
can help you with now?

53:36.347 --> 53:37.913
- Um.

53:38.648 --> 53:41.283
No, I'm almost done.

53:41.418 --> 53:44.320
That is, if you like it.

53:49.626 --> 53:52.328
- You mean it has
to be cashed out?

53:52.330 --> 53:56.765
And hand delivered to some
branch in south America?

53:56.767 --> 53:58.968
I don't see why
this is necessary!

53:58.970 --> 54:02.738
- You would open the account
under an alias via cash deposit

54:02.740 --> 54:04.974
avoiding any checks or
bank to bank transfer.

54:04.976 --> 54:06.675
It would make it
virtually impossible

54:06.677 --> 54:07.943
to trace back to you legally.

54:07.945 --> 54:09.778
Records can't indicate
you transferred the money,

54:09.780 --> 54:12.481
you make a full withdrawal
and close the account.

54:12.483 --> 54:16.785
Meanwhile, an account opens
up offshore by John Doe

54:16.787 --> 54:19.688
with everything intact.

54:22.359 --> 54:25.261
- You think she'll go
that far with this?

54:25.263 --> 54:27.396
- You would know her better,

54:27.398 --> 54:32.534
but she does have the head
start on you for a reason.

54:32.536 --> 54:34.436
- I got to sleep on this.

54:34.438 --> 54:37.606
- Well, I'd agree with you
under regular circumstances.

54:37.608 --> 54:42.444
However, time is not
really on your side.

54:42.679 --> 54:43.912
You have just about 4 hours

54:43.914 --> 54:46.315
until the bank off
of national closes.

54:46.317 --> 54:47.616
- Are you serious?

54:47.618 --> 54:50.619
- Mr. vaugn, you asked
for my financial advice

54:50.621 --> 54:52.655
and I'm giving it
to you candidly.

54:52.657 --> 54:54.556
You're not the first business
owner I've worked for

54:54.558 --> 54:57.359
who needed to move funds
offshore in a hurry.

54:57.361 --> 55:00.796
In fact, at this point
you might even consider me

55:00.798 --> 55:03.065
an expert at this.

55:03.400 --> 55:07.303
- You think they're going
to have that amount of cash

55:07.305 --> 55:09.338
and on such short notice?

55:09.340 --> 55:14.510
- The main branch handles
the heavy transactions.

55:14.512 --> 55:18.080
One duffel bag size should do.

55:18.982 --> 55:22.718
About the size of your gym bag.

55:23.486 --> 55:28.624
- You're not kidding about
doing this before, huh?

55:38.668 --> 55:40.769
- I got the exact
one you wanted.

55:40.771 --> 55:43.839
I had to go to three
different stores to get it.

55:43.841 --> 55:44.940
I don't understand--

55:44.942 --> 55:47.776
- you
don't need to understand.

55:47.778 --> 55:50.646
- So what next? I
wait for the car and--

55:50.648 --> 55:53.015
- you'll
have a few seconds

55:53.017 --> 55:54.550
and that's all you'll need.

55:54.552 --> 55:58.987
You can't hesitate
or you'll miss it.

55:59.522 --> 56:00.456
- And if I do?

56:00.458 --> 56:03.459
- Then you
may run into some turbulence.

56:03.461 --> 56:07.763
Nothing that that piece in
your glove box can't handle.

56:11.468 --> 56:12.968
- Well, father,

56:12.970 --> 56:15.571
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

56:15.573 --> 56:17.539
- Okay, young man.

56:17.541 --> 56:18.507
Thank you.

56:18.509 --> 56:21.710
You worked a miracle
on that rv today.

56:21.712 --> 56:24.480
May the lord keep you.

56:25.648 --> 56:26.749
- It's no miracle, sir.

56:26.751 --> 56:30.853
It wouldn't have happened had
you not given me permission.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.054
- You're too humble, boy.

56:32.056 --> 56:35.824
- Maybe now you can
use it for guests.

56:35.826 --> 56:38.594
I didn't mean for
myself, father.

56:38.596 --> 56:41.730
I'm doing just fine staying
with the Andersons.

56:41.732 --> 56:46.435
They got a real fun
dog and everything.

56:46.669 --> 56:48.137
The Andersons?

56:48.139 --> 56:51.774
Warren and Barbara Anderson?

56:54.511 --> 56:57.546
When did they move out here?

56:58.516 --> 57:01.750
They don't seem the type
to take in strangers.

57:01.752 --> 57:03.452
- Sir?

57:04.487 --> 57:05.421
- Nothing.

57:05.423 --> 57:09.558
They just keep to
themselves is all.

57:13.563 --> 57:16.832
- Keeping my entire
life in a duffel bag,

57:16.834 --> 57:18.634
overnight in a hotel?

57:18.636 --> 57:21.537
It's kind of freaking me out!

57:21.539 --> 57:23.205
- Hotel, huh?

57:24.040 --> 57:27.075
- She changed the locks.

57:29.479 --> 57:31.947
- You know you don't
have to do this.

57:31.949 --> 57:34.550
It's just a suggestion.

57:34.552 --> 57:36.852
- Good one.

57:37.620 --> 57:42.157
Just be here tomorrow morning
to talk about my travel.

57:42.159 --> 57:43.158
- Sure thing.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.962
We'll work out your itinerary
as soon as I get in.

57:48.665 --> 57:51.233
- Oh, I almost forgot.

57:51.235 --> 57:53.502
Thanks for the book.

57:53.504 --> 57:56.104
Keeps things in perspective.

58:57.100 --> 59:00.702
- I
hope you're ready.

01:03:04.247 --> 01:03:06.214
- Help me!

01:03:07.350 --> 01:03:08.450
Help!

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.453
Command you.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.496
Make me rich!

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:34.876
Where you got me going?

01:04:09.378 --> 01:04:12.247
Right here? Right here?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.548
Right here?

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:25.193
Whatever you say.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.028
Whatever you say.

01:04:34.070 --> 01:04:36.638
Why you following me?

01:04:50.486 --> 01:04:52.220
No!

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.956
I don't know, man!

01:04:58.027 --> 01:04:59.661
No I didn't!

01:05:00.096 --> 01:05:01.997
No I didn't, man!

01:06:26.148 --> 01:06:27.983
- License and registration?

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.284
- Is everything okay?

01:06:29.286 --> 01:06:34.122
- Can I see your license
and registration, sir?

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:45.000
Please keep your hands
where I can see them.

01:06:45.134 --> 01:06:47.435
- I'm hurrying up!

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:50.772
I'm surprised nobody stole it!

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:03.084
Alright! Why you rushing me?

01:07:03.619 --> 01:07:06.187
- Is this your car?

01:07:06.389 --> 01:07:09.391
- Yes it is, officer.
Is there a problem?

01:07:09.393 --> 01:07:11.159
- What brings you down
to this neighborhood

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:12.227
so late at night?

01:07:12.229 --> 01:07:15.397
- I'm just driving
home from work.

01:07:21.404 --> 01:07:24.039
I made a wrong turn.

01:07:29.678 --> 01:07:32.447
- I'll be right back.

01:07:53.102 --> 01:07:55.437
You're good to go.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:59.707
Drive safely, have
a nice evening.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.826
- You got your payment.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.228
- What payment?

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.295
- You got the bag.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.697
- Easy, Jack.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:56.631
- Where is it?

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:59.334
- That's
your problem, not ours.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:00.902
I gave you your window.

01:09:00.904 --> 01:09:02.337
If you can't hold on to it--

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:04.305
- you don't understand,
i had to stash it.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.175
I don't need to.

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:07.908
Time's up.

01:09:07.911 --> 01:09:09.611
I'll see you shortly.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:11.779
I think your wife is asleep.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.884
I'll try not to wake.

01:10:19.281 --> 01:10:22.217
- Where's my money?!

01:11:11.767 --> 01:11:12.600
- Jack?

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.302
- Jill, make sure the
windows are closed

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:17.405
and the patio door is locked.

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:19.941
- The patio door?
What's going on?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.909
- Just do it!

01:11:22.044 --> 01:11:23.745
- It is. I always lock it.

01:11:23.747 --> 01:11:25.013
- I'll be home in 15 minutes.

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:26.514
Get dressed, pack some clothes.

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:28.283
You can't stay there tonight.

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:29.550
I'm picking you up.

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:32.787
- Jack, you haven't
called me in three days.

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:38.293
- I can't explain right
now! Just get dressed!

01:12:40.522 --> 01:12:41.656
- Go, man!

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:44.092
I don't need you anymore!

01:12:44.094 --> 01:12:46.861
I got it. I don't need you.

01:12:48.398 --> 01:12:49.597
- What is going on, Jack?

01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.666
- We gotta go. I'll
tell you in the car.

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:53.401
- What?

01:12:58.508 --> 01:13:00.141
- Mr. vaugn?

01:13:05.482 --> 01:13:07.081
Mr. vaugn?

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:14.722
Mr. vaugn, is everything
okay in there?

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:24.465
- I don't understand why
you don't just tell me

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:25.500
what's going on.

01:13:25.502 --> 01:13:27.502
- I told you, you
wouldn't understand!

01:13:27.504 --> 01:13:29.937
- Well I need to
know where I'm going!

01:13:29.939 --> 01:13:31.739
And why!

01:13:32.841 --> 01:13:34.642
- I'm taking you
to the only place

01:13:34.644 --> 01:13:35.843
I know is safe right now.

01:13:35.845 --> 01:13:39.046
After that, I haven't
figured it out yet.

01:13:39.048 --> 01:13:41.182
- Safe from what?

01:13:44.753 --> 01:13:46.587
Oh my god.

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.991
Are you running from the police?

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:51.726
- No.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:54.028
- Then why are we
driving this far?

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.197
Who is after you?

01:14:04.973 --> 01:14:07.542
I don't know if I can
do this anymore Jack.

01:14:07.544 --> 01:14:09.544
- Jill, please listen to me.

01:14:09.546 --> 01:14:13.981
I wouldn't do this
unless we had to.

01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.783
- No Jack,

01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:18.853
that's not what I mean.

01:14:40.042 --> 01:14:42.477
- Stay in the car.

01:15:23.886 --> 01:15:27.188
Father, I'm sorry about this.

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.023
- It's okay.

01:15:31.994 --> 01:15:34.028
Is everything all right?

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.796
- I know you don't
know me very well,

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:38.199
but I need to ask you a favor.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:40.568
I can't ask anybody else.

01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:42.870
I need your help.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.711
I need to stay here

01:15:50.713 --> 01:15:52.547
for a while.

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:56.984
- I can call sister Katherine

01:15:56.986 --> 01:15:59.854
from our charitable
works tomorrow.

01:15:59.856 --> 01:16:02.857
She can provide you with
some temporary housing

01:16:02.859 --> 01:16:03.858
and sustenance.

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:07.328
- I don't need money, father.

01:16:07.696 --> 01:16:10.865
I need to be near god's house.

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.301
Is there any way
we can stay here?

01:16:13.303 --> 01:16:14.902
- We have no space here.

01:16:14.904 --> 01:16:19.140
But there is a motel
a few miles up the road.

01:16:19.142 --> 01:16:20.241
- That won't cut it.

01:16:20.243 --> 01:16:22.610
- May I ask you why
you must stay here?

01:16:22.612 --> 01:16:26.347
- It's the only place i
trust my wife's safety.

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:31.285
I need to leave her here.

01:16:32.955 --> 01:16:35.823
- I think it best if you
come back in the morning

01:16:35.825 --> 01:16:37.758
and we call sister Katherine.

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.993
- Father, you don't understand.

01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:40.761
- No sir, you don't understand!

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:44.065
I am sure you can find another
option for her lodging.

01:16:44.067 --> 01:16:45.933
- Where? She doesn't
have anybody else.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.602
- Then stay with her.

01:16:47.604 --> 01:16:48.703
- That's impossible.

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:50.104
She can't be around
me right now.

01:16:50.106 --> 01:16:52.373
It's too dangerous.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:55.876
I need to leave her here.

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:58.346
- I'm a priest.

01:16:58.348 --> 01:17:00.247
- I know, that's why
i brought her here.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:03.718
This place looks like it
used to provide sanctuary.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:04.952
- Yes, that is true.

01:17:04.954 --> 01:17:06.721
Then there has to be
a place for guests.

01:17:06.723 --> 01:17:11.659
There is no living space
here besides my own and...

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:17.365
- I'm doing what you told me to.

01:17:17.367 --> 01:17:20.401
I'm going to the desert.

01:17:36.752 --> 01:17:38.119
- Hello?

01:17:44.893 --> 01:17:46.427
Hello?

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:59.674
- There might be an old,
small, and uncomfortable place

01:17:59.676 --> 01:18:02.209
where she can rest.

01:18:02.344 --> 01:18:04.078
But I cannot tend to her

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.349
because it could
scar my reputation.

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:09.350
- I understand.

01:18:09.352 --> 01:18:11.952
- Nor is she to disclose
that she is a guest here.

01:18:11.954 --> 01:18:17.992
She can use the facilities,
but she must tend to herself.

01:18:20.095 --> 01:18:22.730
- Thank you, father.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.235
- How long must she stay here?

01:18:28.237 --> 01:18:29.870
- I can only
promise I'll be back

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:32.807
as soon as I've
figured this out.

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:07.134
- This is your last chance.

01:25:03.832 --> 01:25:07.101
- Thanks for the lunch, father.

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:08.535
- You are a fast eater.

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:12.106
- May I suggest
something, father?

01:25:13.208 --> 01:25:15.409
- Yeah, go ahead.

01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:17.111
- It's a shame to
leave your cooking

01:25:17.113 --> 01:25:19.279
out on the porch like that.

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:23.717
You ought to at least walk
it over to her doorstep.

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.552
- I think she's all right.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.387
She hasn't complained so far.

01:25:27.389 --> 01:25:29.189
- That's because
she's being nice.

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.892
I've seen her most of the time
bringing back a cold plate

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:33.827
because by the time
she comes out for it

01:25:33.829 --> 01:25:35.429
food's not steaming anymore.

01:25:35.431 --> 01:25:38.198
And I figure it can't
be as good either.

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:42.603
- I'd rather not do anything
different unless I have to.

01:25:42.605 --> 01:25:43.570
- Okay, father.

01:25:43.572 --> 01:25:47.441
It's just a shame she can't get
to taste it as good as I do.

01:25:47.443 --> 01:25:48.775
It may also draw less attention

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:50.277
to her staying here and such,

01:25:50.279 --> 01:25:53.280
since she won't have
to come out as much.

01:26:30.685 --> 01:26:32.519
- Mrs. Jill?

01:27:00.715 --> 01:27:02.950
- Hello, father.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:06.787
- Hello, Mrs. Jill.

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:11.358
- So nice out here.

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:14.661
So different from the city.

01:27:15.363 --> 01:27:16.897
Is there anything
that you're finding

01:27:16.899 --> 01:27:20.000
unsuitable with your stay?

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.405
- No, everything is fine.

01:27:26.007 --> 01:27:28.909
As good as it can be.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:32.246
- With your permission
I'll be bringing your food

01:27:32.248 --> 01:27:33.914
to your front door.

01:27:33.916 --> 01:27:37.551
So that it doesn't get cold.

01:27:39.254 --> 01:27:41.688
- Thank you, father.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.958
Yes, I would like that.

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:49.663
- Is there anything else
i can provide you with?

01:27:49.665 --> 01:27:54.034
- You've been very
gracious, father.

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:57.337
- I'm glad you're content.

01:28:36.544 --> 01:28:38.345
- Hello?

01:28:43.851 --> 01:28:45.585
Hello?

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:50.991
I'm looking for a
healer in these parts.

01:29:07.576 --> 01:29:08.608
Wait.

01:29:37.905 --> 01:29:39.773
Wait! Wait!

01:29:41.909 --> 01:29:43.744
I'll do it.

01:30:12.173 --> 01:30:14.808
- Thank you, father.

01:30:34.695 --> 01:30:36.830
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

01:30:36.832 --> 01:30:38.098
- Yes sir, it is.

01:30:38.100 --> 01:30:43.170
You done a good thing, making
it easier for her and all.

01:30:43.172 --> 01:30:45.605
- It was a good suggestion.

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:48.508
- She still eats alone.

01:30:50.144 --> 01:30:52.512
You and her both.

01:30:52.814 --> 01:30:56.616
Probably gets real
boring to eat alone.

01:30:56.618 --> 01:31:00.554
Well if you didn't eat so
fast, I would join you.

01:31:00.556 --> 01:31:02.122
But every time I make
a plate for myself,

01:31:02.124 --> 01:31:05.525
your food has
already disappeared.

01:31:05.527 --> 01:31:06.893
- Sorry father,

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:09.229
I get real hungry.

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:11.198
The best way to
take care of a guest

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:13.533
is to give them company,

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:15.902
at least while they're eating.

01:31:15.904 --> 01:31:19.239
Makes the food taste better.

01:31:29.917 --> 01:31:32.152
- You can't use
that in here, man.

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:36.056
- I don't want it to get stolen.

01:31:38.526 --> 01:31:40.861
I'm buying these.

01:31:40.995 --> 01:31:42.496
- Really?

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:08.822
- Hey.

01:32:08.824 --> 01:32:10.190
Hey, hey, man. Hey!

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.660
Hey! Hey!

01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:16.663
Come back here, man.

01:32:32.947 --> 01:32:36.983
- How did you know
i had them in me?

01:32:37.151 --> 01:32:40.554
- You did not come
here to ask me that.

01:32:40.556 --> 01:32:42.889
How did you find me?

01:32:42.891 --> 01:32:44.991
- Trial and error.

01:32:44.993 --> 01:32:49.195
- Who placed those
scrolls inside of you?

01:32:49.197 --> 01:32:50.997
- I did.

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:54.267
- Yet, you have not
come to kill me.

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:57.103
- Why would I wanna kill you?

01:32:57.105 --> 01:32:59.205
- Many reasons.

01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:01.908
Your master would know.

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.176
- Master?

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:05.612
I don't have a master.

01:33:05.614 --> 01:33:07.948
- Are you certain of that?

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.934
- Mrs. Jill?

01:34:00.936 --> 01:34:03.403
I brought you some fruit.

01:34:03.405 --> 01:34:09.409
I thought you might
want something
refreshing in the heat.

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:14.948
- Thank you, father.

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:17.384
That's very swe...

01:34:17.885 --> 01:34:19.719
Kind of you.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:36.670
- Be sure to try the pears.

01:34:36.672 --> 01:34:38.905
They're in season.

01:34:40.307 --> 01:34:42.942
- I definitely will.

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.846
How is your day?

01:35:03.131 --> 01:35:05.198
- That's a good boy.

01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.768
He's been having issues
with the mayor all week.

01:35:08.770 --> 01:35:11.171
Ain't that right mister mayor?

01:35:11.173 --> 01:35:12.472
But he's going to get his.

01:35:12.474 --> 01:35:16.876
Mister governor, he'll
get what's coming to him.

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:21.181
- You have
entered into a pact

01:35:21.183 --> 01:35:23.950
with a great deceiver.

01:35:24.085 --> 01:35:26.453
- How do I break out of it?

01:35:29.324 --> 01:35:33.893
- You must give up what
you have gained from it.

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:34.994
- I can't.

01:35:34.996 --> 01:35:37.430
- Then you are bound to it.

01:35:37.432 --> 01:35:40.066
- There has to be another way.

01:35:40.068 --> 01:35:44.003
- Your feelings won't
change the way of the world.

01:35:44.005 --> 01:35:45.972
- If I did that, i
would lose my freedom

01:35:45.974 --> 01:35:47.874
and I'm not going to.

01:35:47.876 --> 01:35:49.342
- Why?

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:52.479
Must you have freedom?

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:55.515
- I have a wife and...

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.450
- A child.

01:35:58.986 --> 01:36:00.253
- I have to protect them.

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:01.354
They're innocent.

01:36:01.356 --> 01:36:03.256
They have nothing
to do with this.

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:06.526
- You cannot protect them.

01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:11.898
But he cannot harm them either.

01:36:12.066 --> 01:36:14.768
- You're saying he
can't hurt them?

01:36:14.770 --> 01:36:16.369
- Not unless they let him.

01:36:16.371 --> 01:36:19.939
- What do you mean?
How do you know this?

01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:22.275
- Could you read what was
written on those scrolls

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:25.845
before you placed
them inside you?

01:36:25.847 --> 01:36:27.413
- No.

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.482
They're in some strange writing.

01:36:29.484 --> 01:36:33.086
- They are not meant
for us to read.

01:36:33.088 --> 01:36:36.055
But it tells who you
are dealing with.

01:36:36.057 --> 01:36:37.557
- Who?

01:36:37.892 --> 01:36:40.193
The man in my cell?

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:43.363
- He is not a man.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:48.835
But he can come
in the form of one

01:36:48.837 --> 01:36:50.003
and other things.

01:36:50.005 --> 01:36:51.838
- Who is he?

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:56.276
- I could not read the scrolls.

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:59.479
But my friends did.

01:36:59.481 --> 01:37:01.414
- Friends?

01:37:03.984 --> 01:37:06.553
You deal with them?

01:37:08.522 --> 01:37:10.356
- The one seeking you

01:37:10.358 --> 01:37:13.193
is not of the normal kind.

01:37:13.195 --> 01:37:15.295
They say he is from the old age

01:37:15.297 --> 01:37:18.464
and he has many who serve him.

01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:22.535
They say his name is
mentioned in the scriptures

01:37:24.305 --> 01:37:26.206
of all faiths.

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:28.107
Normally they would
be able to assist

01:37:28.109 --> 01:37:30.977
but they have retreated.

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:33.246
- Retreated?

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:36.482
- They do not want to
risk dealing with him.

01:37:36.484 --> 01:37:42.055
They also do not understand
why he has sought you out.

01:37:42.057 --> 01:37:43.223
- I made a--

01:37:43.225 --> 01:37:44.023
- yes,

01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:47.594
but if it is who they fear it is

01:37:47.596 --> 01:37:51.231
you must have done something.

01:37:51.233 --> 01:37:55.335
Something that would
draw his interest

01:37:55.337 --> 01:37:56.302
or anger.

01:37:56.304 --> 01:38:01.507
Enough to travel across
a long way to find you.

01:38:04.478 --> 01:38:07.513
This is beyond my
means to help you.

01:38:07.515 --> 01:38:08.448
- Please!

01:38:08.450 --> 01:38:10.884
I don't know anyone else
who understands this!

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:13.219
What do I need to stop him?!

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:19.659
- There are no material things
that can aid you in this.

01:38:19.661 --> 01:38:23.029
I gave you your solution.

01:38:23.031 --> 01:38:24.297
- I can't.

01:38:24.299 --> 01:38:26.132
I thought you knew a way out.

01:38:26.134 --> 01:38:29.903
A way the priest couldn't offer.

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:36.609
- You are a religious man?

01:38:36.944 --> 01:38:39.512
- I believe in god, yes.

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.481
Why do you ask?

01:38:41.483 --> 01:38:46.219
- Because my friends were
unable to approach you.

01:38:47.288 --> 01:38:49.389
Now I know why.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.069
- You can bring that inside.

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:04.938
If you're still not coming in

01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:06.940
you're going to have to take
it all the way around back

01:39:06.942 --> 01:39:08.574
to the storage room.

01:39:08.576 --> 01:39:11.611
- Not a problem, father.

01:39:12.613 --> 01:39:14.314
What you getting ready for?

01:39:14.316 --> 01:39:18.584
- A priest can stay well
groomed if he wishes.

01:39:18.586 --> 01:39:20.053
- Silly.

01:39:20.055 --> 01:39:21.454
- What is?

01:39:21.456 --> 01:39:24.090
- That you and Mrs. Jill
still having conversations

01:39:24.092 --> 01:39:25.191
through the door.

01:39:25.193 --> 01:39:27.060
You might as well just
sit and eat together.

01:39:27.062 --> 01:39:32.231
Ain't no harm in that.
And it's a lot less silly.

01:39:32.233 --> 01:39:34.634
- I'll see you tomorrow.

01:39:34.636 --> 01:39:35.601
- Okay, father.

01:39:35.603 --> 01:39:39.706
Just don't be afraid
to be yourself.

01:39:47.047 --> 01:39:49.515
- And make sure you keep close

01:39:49.517 --> 01:39:51.751
what you're given.

01:39:59.093 --> 01:40:02.328
You know how to read that?

01:40:03.397 --> 01:40:08.534
Then don't trust your
life to superstitions.

01:40:24.151 --> 01:40:25.785
- Thank you.

01:40:32.226 --> 01:40:34.160
Will this protect me?

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:49.208
- This may.

01:40:56.183 --> 01:40:58.418
If it were full.

01:41:49.770 --> 01:41:53.673
- Would you like to come inside?

01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:22.802
- This may.

01:42:24.404 --> 01:42:26.639
If it were full.

01:43:13.487 --> 01:43:16.389
Instead of serving you,

01:43:16.391 --> 01:43:19.192
you'll end up serving it.

01:44:45.412 --> 01:44:49.482
- Your food is
always so delicious.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:51.917
- Thank you.

01:44:52.052 --> 01:44:56.622
They left a substantial
pantry for me.

01:45:03.363 --> 01:45:04.830
- I have a question.

01:45:04.832 --> 01:45:08.401
I hope you don't get offended.

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.671
- Please.

01:45:11.673 --> 01:45:13.739
Go right ahead.

01:45:14.641 --> 01:45:19.312
- How long have you
been a priest for?

01:45:19.314 --> 01:45:21.080
- Five years.

01:45:22.549 --> 01:45:24.083
Why?

01:45:25.986 --> 01:45:29.055
- You don't seem like the type.

01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:36.095
- Okay.

01:45:36.097 --> 01:45:39.699
It's my turn to
ask you a question.

01:45:39.701 --> 01:45:42.568
- Okay. Hit me with it.

01:45:43.403 --> 01:45:48.741
- What did your husband say to
you to convince you to stay?

01:45:55.749 --> 01:45:56.949
I'm sorry.

01:45:56.951 --> 01:46:01.487
I knew that was a
bad idea to ask that.

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:12.098
- He said if he
failed this time,

01:46:13.633 --> 01:46:16.502
that I could leave him.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:27.813
Very generous, huh?

01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:47.933
The dessert was a
really nice surprise.

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:04.183
- Looks like it's getting dark.

01:47:06.686 --> 01:47:08.754
I'll leave you to your evening.

01:47:08.756 --> 01:47:11.557
Let me get these
plates out of your way.

01:49:03.070 --> 01:49:06.038
- I've always wanted to travel.

01:49:06.040 --> 01:49:08.807
See different people.

01:49:09.743 --> 01:49:14.113
I've been cutting
hair for too long.

01:49:17.284 --> 01:49:20.553
If he comes back

01:49:22.122 --> 01:49:24.890
I'm going to tell him.

01:49:28.695 --> 01:49:31.030
That I want to be with you.

01:49:37.971 --> 01:49:41.740
- Then we'll start
our life together.

01:49:44.011 --> 01:49:48.047
I'll have to let the church
know after we've gone.

01:49:48.049 --> 01:49:51.984
If the laicization
starts before then,

01:49:51.986 --> 01:49:56.355
I might have to go
before the community.

01:49:56.357 --> 01:49:57.823
They may investigate.

01:49:57.825 --> 01:50:01.260
- I know this won't be easy.

01:50:01.628 --> 01:50:03.729
For either of us.

01:50:06.199 --> 01:50:08.367
Like you told me,

01:50:09.302 --> 01:50:12.037
if we love each other

01:50:12.339 --> 01:50:15.307
then the rest doesn't matter.

01:50:15.309 --> 01:50:16.976
Right?

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:30.222
There's something else.

01:50:30.824 --> 01:50:32.791
- What's that?

01:50:34.728 --> 01:50:38.764
- Remember when i
told you I was late?

01:51:11.231 --> 01:51:14.033
- How do you know for sure?

01:51:14.035 --> 01:51:16.001
- I just know.

01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:22.174
I thought you would be happy.

01:51:22.176 --> 01:51:23.676
I feel so stupid.

01:51:23.678 --> 01:51:24.843
- I am happy.

01:51:24.845 --> 01:51:29.381
This is all happening
really fast for me.

01:51:29.383 --> 01:51:30.349
I never thought

01:51:30.351 --> 01:51:35.754
two months ago that I'd be
nearly married and with a child.

01:51:39.459 --> 01:51:41.894
I'll be a husband.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:48.467
- And a father.

01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:53.038
Just a different kind.

01:52:33.079 --> 01:52:35.447
- I'm almost done here.

01:52:35.449 --> 01:52:37.382
- Take your time.

01:52:37.384 --> 01:52:39.184
- Thanks.

01:52:39.819 --> 01:52:42.354
- Where you headed?

01:52:43.823 --> 01:52:44.757
- Oh lord!

01:52:44.759 --> 01:52:46.492
Forsake not for our inequities,

01:52:46.494 --> 01:52:49.394
neither punish thou
others for our wounds.

01:52:49.396 --> 01:52:53.198
Still thy wrath oh lord,
absolve oh lord, have mercy.

01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:57.836
Have mercy on us, for this
child is out of wedlock!

01:52:57.838 --> 01:53:00.939
Count not our acts
as fornication,

01:53:00.941 --> 01:53:02.908
but rather...

01:53:03.042 --> 01:53:07.846
As a pre-marriage within
the sanctity of the church!

01:53:15.289 --> 01:53:17.022
- Temperature Gauge
is out on my car.

01:53:17.024 --> 01:53:21.026
Started steaming on me, i
barely got it off the road.

01:53:21.028 --> 01:53:23.796
- You're going to need a
lot more water than that

01:53:23.798 --> 01:53:25.364
where you're going.

01:53:25.366 --> 01:53:27.065
- Yeah.

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:30.002
- Long way to be
traveling alone.

01:53:30.004 --> 01:53:33.438
Heading back to your family?

01:53:38.912 --> 01:53:40.579
- My wife.

01:53:51.324 --> 01:53:52.291
- Sorry father.

01:53:52.293 --> 01:53:55.194
I was trying to stomp
out a black widow's web.

01:53:55.196 --> 01:53:56.428
She'd laid a bunch of eggs.

01:53:56.430 --> 01:53:59.364
Can't have those running
around the church.

01:53:59.366 --> 01:54:01.400
- Are you okay?

01:54:01.568 --> 01:54:03.435
- Oh yes, father. Thank you.

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:05.971
I'm afraid there's a
lot more nests around.

01:54:05.973 --> 01:54:08.874
It's the season you know.

01:54:08.876 --> 01:54:10.409
- Just be careful.

01:54:10.411 --> 01:54:14.012
- That and she's next
to the church so.

01:54:14.014 --> 01:54:18.917
- A long time to be
leaving a woman alone.

01:54:19.085 --> 01:54:22.154
- You say you're
from around here?

01:54:22.156 --> 01:54:24.923
- Oh, from everywhere.

01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:27.960
I like to come
through here though.

01:54:28.996 --> 01:54:30.562
You take them roads
i told you about.

01:54:30.564 --> 01:54:33.599
It's going to save you
a good half-day's travel.

01:54:33.601 --> 01:54:36.468
Get home to the
wife a lot sooner.

01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:39.104
- Thanks. I appreciate it.

01:54:39.106 --> 01:54:41.340
- Just remember.

01:54:41.474 --> 01:54:43.909
Priest or no priest,

01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:47.145
I wouldn't trust
faith over biology.

01:54:47.147 --> 01:54:49.581
- I didn't catch your name.

01:55:30.490 --> 01:55:32.691
- I killed them.

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.361
All the babies.

01:55:36.529 --> 01:55:38.630
Still haven't caught
all the mothers.

01:55:38.632 --> 01:55:41.133
I got some, but some got away.

01:55:41.135 --> 01:55:45.203
Should slow them
down for a while.

01:55:45.471 --> 01:55:48.106
- Thank you, my son.

01:55:48.241 --> 01:55:51.476
You're doing good work
for the lord's house.

01:55:53.379 --> 01:55:55.580
All of them, huh?

01:55:55.582 --> 01:55:57.549
- Yes, father.

01:55:57.951 --> 01:55:59.151
- How can you be sure?

01:55:59.153 --> 01:56:04.289
- I swept all the eggs and
put them inside this bottle.

01:56:05.224 --> 01:56:09.227
Something Mr.
Anderson showed me.

01:56:09.595 --> 01:56:11.697
- What is that?

01:56:12.165 --> 01:56:13.465
- Kills eggs.

01:56:13.467 --> 01:56:14.566
Kills babies too.

01:56:14.568 --> 01:56:18.103
I think that's actually
what it's meant to do.

01:56:19.239 --> 01:56:21.139
- Where did you get that from?

01:56:21.141 --> 01:56:24.276
- From Mr. Anderson's
hallway cabinet.

01:56:24.278 --> 01:56:26.645
I can't really make out
the name of the drug.

01:56:26.647 --> 01:56:29.214
I think Mrs. Anderson took this

01:56:29.216 --> 01:56:30.449
right after they had both agreed

01:56:30.451 --> 01:56:34.753
not to have the
baby in her stomach.

01:56:35.755 --> 01:56:38.323
What is it, father?

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:41.259
- Nothing, it's...

01:56:42.061 --> 01:56:43.395
Just so strange.

01:56:43.397 --> 01:56:44.696
- Yeah, I thought so too.

01:56:44.698 --> 01:56:46.631
They were talking
about how it's meant

01:56:46.633 --> 01:56:49.501
to get rid of stomach ulcers.

01:56:49.503 --> 01:56:50.769
- No, what's strange is that

01:56:50.771 --> 01:56:55.474
Warren always asked me
to pray for his wife

01:56:56.676 --> 01:56:59.444
so she can be fertile.

01:56:59.679 --> 01:57:03.115
- Well father, i
got to get going.

01:57:03.117 --> 01:57:05.550
The lunch today was great.

01:57:05.552 --> 01:57:07.786
- Bless you child.

01:57:08.121 --> 01:57:09.287
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:57:09.289 --> 01:57:11.757
- Should I leave the
cleaning stuff here?

01:57:11.759 --> 01:57:14.159
Or take it for tomorrow?

01:57:15.496 --> 01:57:18.397
- No, you can leave it.

01:58:12.585 --> 01:58:15.520
- Baby, I'm on my way back.

01:58:15.522 --> 01:58:17.522
I should be there
by tomorrow night,

01:58:17.524 --> 01:58:20.258
if nothing goes
wrong with the car.

01:58:20.260 --> 01:58:24.162
I hope you're not giving father
Joseph too hard of a time.

01:58:24.164 --> 01:58:26.164
He's a good man.

01:58:26.166 --> 01:58:27.866
God bless him.

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:45.817
- I was thinking about
what you were saying.

01:58:45.819 --> 01:58:48.887
About rushing into things.

01:58:49.222 --> 01:58:51.656
I know this is a
big step for you,

01:58:51.658 --> 01:58:55.360
but it's a big step for me too.

01:58:59.532 --> 01:59:01.900
If we know we can
make each other happy,

01:59:01.902 --> 01:59:03.435
I mean, doesn't that please god?

01:59:03.437 --> 01:59:06.905
- My dear, you're not eating.

01:59:07.740 --> 01:59:09.741
Do you not like it?

01:59:09.743 --> 01:59:12.377
- No, of course not.

01:59:14.647 --> 01:59:17.449
- I think when we're
officially married,

01:59:17.451 --> 01:59:20.919
it'll be better for both of us.

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:22.687
Of course,

01:59:22.689 --> 01:59:26.658
yours is going to have
to be annulled first.

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:44.496
Jill?

02:01:44.498 --> 02:01:45.463
Open the door.

02:01:46.466 --> 02:01:47.966
- I'm okay. Just go.

02:01:47.968 --> 02:01:51.403
- No, please open the door.

02:01:55.842 --> 02:01:58.410
- It hurts so much.

02:01:58.577 --> 02:01:59.611
- Oh, dear god.

02:01:59.613 --> 02:02:02.080
- It hurts so much.

02:02:07.019 --> 02:02:08.420
- You're going to be okay.

02:02:08.422 --> 02:02:09.487
- No, it's dead.

02:02:09.489 --> 02:02:11.656
- It's gonna be okay.

02:02:11.658 --> 02:02:13.358
- It's dead!

02:03:02.708 --> 02:03:05.877
- Terrible thing, father.

02:03:06.645 --> 02:03:10.648
What's she going to say
to her poor husband?

02:03:13.886 --> 02:03:17.021
- He's not going to know.

02:03:17.156 --> 02:03:19.157
She promised me.

02:03:20.159 --> 02:03:21.993
- I hope I'm not speaking
out of place, father,

02:03:21.995 --> 02:03:25.430
but do you really think she
can keep a secret like that

02:03:25.432 --> 02:03:27.665
from her husband?

02:03:29.101 --> 02:03:31.870
- She's divorcing him.

02:03:32.004 --> 02:03:35.173
- Sure about that, father?

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:40.812
He seems like a pretty
dangerous fellow.

02:03:40.814 --> 02:03:45.517
Those were prison
tattoos I saw on him.

02:03:45.951 --> 02:03:47.685
- You never saw him.

02:03:47.687 --> 02:03:49.454
How do you know that?

02:03:49.456 --> 02:03:50.989
- Yes I have.

02:03:50.991 --> 02:03:54.759
I saw him when he came and
gave confession one night.

02:03:54.761 --> 02:03:56.461
I remember because
i was staying late

02:03:56.463 --> 02:03:58.530
and that's the latest
I've seen anyone come

02:03:58.532 --> 02:04:01.199
and give a confession.

02:04:04.937 --> 02:04:08.506
- Dear god, what have I done?

02:04:09.842 --> 02:04:12.710
- I'm sorry to see
you like this father.

02:04:12.712 --> 02:04:15.113
I mean, I wish i
could stay with you

02:04:15.115 --> 02:04:17.816
but I have to leave early today.

02:04:17.818 --> 02:04:20.685
I found some dead rats
behind the kitchen.

02:04:20.687 --> 02:04:24.155
I think they finally
went for that rat poison.

02:04:24.157 --> 02:04:26.491
I had to mix it with
some of that good food

02:04:26.493 --> 02:04:27.859
you gave me yesterday.

02:04:27.861 --> 02:04:32.564
I told you, nobody
can resist your food.

02:04:33.566 --> 02:04:37.669
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

02:04:48.981 --> 02:04:50.782
- Eat, my dear.

02:04:50.784 --> 02:04:56.120
You lost a lot of blood.
You need your energy.

02:04:59.592 --> 02:05:01.259
You know,

02:05:01.694 --> 02:05:04.162
maybe it was a
blessing in disguise

02:05:04.164 --> 02:05:08.633
being that the child would
have been born out of wedlock.

02:05:08.635 --> 02:05:13.605
And if your husband would
have come home to a child

02:05:13.607 --> 02:05:17.275
it would have made things for us

02:05:17.643 --> 02:05:19.677
more difficult.

02:05:20.813 --> 02:05:22.280
Of course, I know
you're not going

02:05:22.282 --> 02:05:25.617
to say anything to him right?

02:05:26.151 --> 02:05:29.220
I was thinking
maybe we shouldn't

02:05:29.222 --> 02:05:33.057
mention anything
about us either.

02:05:33.059 --> 02:05:38.930
Just for a while, until things
settle down for both of us.

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:42.300
Eat your food dear.

02:05:49.909 --> 02:05:52.544
Is it hurting again?

02:05:52.912 --> 02:05:54.913
I can get you some water.

02:05:54.915 --> 02:05:58.883
It's probably just the pain
from last night resurfacing.

02:05:58.885 --> 02:06:00.785
It'll go away.

02:09:46.845 --> 02:09:48.980
- Father Joseph.

02:09:54.052 --> 02:09:56.087
- You've arrived very late.

02:09:56.089 --> 02:09:57.221
- I'm indebted to you.

02:09:57.223 --> 02:09:59.190
I can't thank you enough.

02:09:59.192 --> 02:10:04.095
- I'm not the one who
carries your debt.

02:10:06.799 --> 02:10:08.566
- Where's Jill?

02:10:13.472 --> 02:10:15.573
Where's my wife?

02:10:17.876 --> 02:10:19.410
Father?

02:10:21.013 --> 02:10:23.581
- She fell very ill.

02:10:51.543 --> 02:10:55.213
There was not much I could do.

02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:58.049
There was nothing you
left me to contact you by

02:10:58.051 --> 02:11:02.253
and by the time
the physician came.

02:11:04.156 --> 02:11:07.191
I'm sorry for your loss.

02:11:07.326 --> 02:11:09.961
The lord giveth and...

02:11:11.296 --> 02:11:12.997
Taketh.

02:11:12.999 --> 02:11:15.066
Bless her soul.

02:11:58.543 --> 02:12:00.578
- When did she?

02:12:01.947 --> 02:12:04.282
- Three days ago.

02:12:05.651 --> 02:12:09.220
There was a modest service.

02:12:10.055 --> 02:12:13.024
Due to the difficult
situation I had been put in

02:12:13.026 --> 02:12:18.095
I was forced to say
that she was a traveler

02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:23.601
who needed food and
requested temporary shelter

02:12:23.936 --> 02:12:26.170
and had no family.

02:12:27.406 --> 02:12:29.974
- She had a family.

02:12:31.076 --> 02:12:34.145
She would have met them.

02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:42.720
- I've prepared her
things in her room,

02:12:43.522 --> 02:12:48.392
where you may stay
tonight if you wish.

02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:27.031
My dear, you're not eating.

02:13:27.033 --> 02:13:28.599
It's going to be okay.

02:13:28.601 --> 02:13:31.135
- It's dead!

02:13:50.789 --> 02:13:52.423
- What? Who are you?!

02:13:52.425 --> 02:13:53.758
- Get up!

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:55.292
- Why you doing this?

02:13:55.294 --> 02:13:56.794
- Now!

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:14.145
Start digging.

02:14:14.147 --> 02:14:15.413
- This is madness.

02:14:15.415 --> 02:14:18.416
You disturbed the
dead, your own wife.

02:14:42.507 --> 02:14:44.241
No.

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:52.249
Jack, your wife is dead.

02:14:52.251 --> 02:14:54.251
There's no hope in this.

02:16:05.657 --> 02:16:07.191
Oh lord!

02:16:07.193 --> 02:16:09.560
Please forgive me!

02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:14.431
I've become an
abomination to the church!

02:16:16.868 --> 02:16:19.637
- Speak the truth.

02:16:19.639 --> 02:16:21.338
- Help.

02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:22.940
Help me.

02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:25.876
I've been abducted
by a deranged man!

02:16:25.878 --> 02:16:28.946
Please free me from this!

02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:33.416
- And call
the authorities?

02:16:33.419 --> 02:16:34.317
- Wait.

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:39.356
Who are you? What
are you doing here?

02:16:39.358 --> 02:16:41.358
- Who am I?

02:16:41.360 --> 02:16:42.226
- Yes.

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:45.663
Why won't you show yourself?

02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:54.705
Who are you?

02:16:55.507 --> 02:16:59.743
- I'm the one who got
you into this mess

02:16:59.745 --> 02:17:03.746
and I'm the only one
who can get you out.

02:17:18.731 --> 02:17:23.299
- I don't know you.
You're mistaken.

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:35.713
- You sure about that, father?

02:17:42.787 --> 02:17:45.022
- This is a dream.

02:17:46.558 --> 02:17:49.026
No evil or demon can
penetrate the sanctity

02:17:49.028 --> 02:17:51.428
of the house of the lord!

02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:54.999
- Oh, it can get close enough.

02:17:56.368 --> 02:17:59.803
- The husband of that
woman summoned you.

02:17:59.805 --> 02:18:03.674
You have no quarrel with
me. Leave me in peace!

02:18:03.675 --> 02:18:07.511
- I don't think you'd
want that, father.

02:18:07.513 --> 02:18:08.745
That peace won't last long

02:18:08.748 --> 02:18:12.016
once he gets done
digging up Mrs. Jill.

02:18:14.787 --> 02:18:18.055
I thought you'd need a hand.

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:25.995
What can you do for me?

02:18:26.331 --> 02:18:28.332
- I can free you.

02:18:30.302 --> 02:18:32.068
- To what end?

02:18:32.971 --> 02:18:35.973
Untying me isn't gonna change--

02:18:35.975 --> 02:18:38.409
- Jack should die.

02:18:39.843 --> 02:18:43.547
That is what you're suggesting.

02:18:43.715 --> 02:18:46.416
And a wise suggestion.

02:18:46.550 --> 02:18:48.451
There's no other way.

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:54.657
- What must I do?

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:59.996
- What's only natural
at this point.

02:19:00.332 --> 02:19:03.000
Renounce the false keeper

02:19:03.002 --> 02:19:06.969
for he has clearly
abandoned you,

02:19:07.105 --> 02:19:09.406
for he keeps nothing

02:19:09.407 --> 02:19:10.974
but an illusion.

02:19:17.514 --> 02:19:21.018
Your devotion has
been in vain, Joseph.

02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:23.020
For the only devotion
that exists now

02:19:23.022 --> 02:19:26.790
is Jack's intent to kill you.

02:19:34.898 --> 02:19:37.134
- What I may say

02:19:38.602 --> 02:19:40.971
will not be entirely
with conviction.

02:19:40.973 --> 02:19:44.742
- As is the story of your lives.

02:19:45.510 --> 02:19:47.544
What matters now

02:19:47.546 --> 02:19:51.515
is that you swear
your loyalty to me.

02:19:51.517 --> 02:19:54.551
The one who brought
you to this condition

02:19:54.553 --> 02:20:00.424
and the one who has the
true power to release you.

02:20:07.565 --> 02:20:09.166
- I swear.

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:14.738
- The pact cannot be
made by words alone.

02:20:40.732 --> 02:20:44.168
- I renounce Christ the lord

02:20:44.969 --> 02:20:47.538
and to you I swear.

02:20:49.541 --> 02:20:52.943
- You renounce him so easily

02:20:53.077 --> 02:20:56.880
as if befitting
of your creation.

02:20:57.449 --> 02:20:59.683
And it's I who must suffer

02:20:59.685 --> 02:21:02.853
for providing him
that assessment.

02:21:08.593 --> 02:21:10.828
I'm free of you.

02:21:11.229 --> 02:21:15.199
I fear the one you've renounced.

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.234
Lord

02:21:19.504 --> 02:21:21.238
of the worlds.

02:21:22.974 --> 02:21:25.142
- Save me!

02:21:28.546 --> 02:21:31.081
Get me out of here!

02:21:53.271 --> 02:21:56.907
- Why did this happen to me?

02:21:57.075 --> 02:22:00.544
I know that's what
you're thinking.

02:22:05.149 --> 02:22:07.584
- I don't owe you anything.

02:22:07.586 --> 02:22:08.652
I don't fear you.

02:22:08.654 --> 02:22:12.756
- You say that
with a pointed gun.

02:22:18.162 --> 02:22:20.731
- I have nothing to give you.

02:22:20.733 --> 02:22:22.566
You've taken everything.

02:22:22.568 --> 02:22:24.001
- I'm glad you recognize that.

02:22:24.003 --> 02:22:30.007
Had you fulfilled our pact
in jail, we wouldn't be here.

02:22:30.575 --> 02:22:33.076
You tried to con me.

02:22:33.078 --> 02:22:34.745
You thought you could
get your freedom

02:22:34.747 --> 02:22:36.680
and leave me empty handed.

02:22:36.682 --> 02:22:41.251
Trick me and use the
church to keep me at bay.

02:22:41.253 --> 02:22:44.221
That's pretty crafty Jack.

02:22:44.223 --> 02:22:46.323
Still a professional.

02:22:48.961 --> 02:22:51.061
- You rigged our
pact from the start.

02:22:51.063 --> 02:22:54.331
- You thought I was a fool.

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:58.035
You hustled your
own pathetic kind

02:22:58.037 --> 02:22:59.937
and even hustled
the house of god

02:22:59.939 --> 02:23:03.574
and you thought you
could hustle me?!

02:23:07.245 --> 02:23:12.349
But now you have felt my wrath.

02:23:17.989 --> 02:23:19.990
- I don't fear you.

02:23:22.728 --> 02:23:24.294
Tricks, that's all you have.

02:23:25.230 --> 02:23:26.964
Threats and lies.

02:23:26.966 --> 02:23:29.766
All your different faces.

02:23:33.972 --> 02:23:37.307
You catch a man at his
weakest and you spin him.

02:23:37.309 --> 02:23:40.310
- Jack, you've exposed me.

02:23:40.312 --> 02:23:44.381
Do you suppose i
should now retire?

02:23:44.749 --> 02:23:46.149
Perhaps I'll consider it,

02:23:46.151 --> 02:23:51.021
but not before I'm done
with your daughter karin.

02:23:51.023 --> 02:23:52.856
- You can't hurt her.

02:23:52.858 --> 02:23:58.328
- Because you will protect
her from me, right?

02:23:58.663 --> 02:24:00.864
Like you did her mother.

02:24:00.866 --> 02:24:03.800
That was very successful.

02:24:08.106 --> 02:24:12.009
- Her mother's death had
nothing to do with you.

02:24:12.011 --> 02:24:15.145
- You really think so?

02:24:17.115 --> 02:24:23.120
Now you're starting to use
that clever mind of yours.

02:24:23.254 --> 02:24:25.355
In case you haven't
gotten it already,

02:24:25.357 --> 02:24:30.427
what should be going through
your mind at this point is,

02:24:30.429 --> 02:24:33.063
how can you stop me?

02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:37.401
- She won't let
you toy with her.

02:24:37.403 --> 02:24:40.671
- Well then she
will be the first.

02:24:40.673 --> 02:24:43.206
Don't act like you
know this girl.

02:24:43.208 --> 02:24:47.411
You know less of her
than you did this priest.

02:24:48.813 --> 02:24:51.848
Jack, you know I've
never hated you.

02:24:51.850 --> 02:24:53.950
I've always looked forward
to working with you

02:24:53.952 --> 02:24:58.021
and I always leave
you a fair offer.

02:24:58.023 --> 02:25:03.126
But I will come from
before you and behind you,

02:25:03.128 --> 02:25:07.097
from your right
and from your left.

02:25:08.066 --> 02:25:11.334
What are you going
to go back to Jack?

02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:15.405
A disconnected daughter whose

02:25:15.407 --> 02:25:17.941
ex-convict father is now

02:25:17.943 --> 02:25:22.045
a fugitive for
three more murders?

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:25.115
His own wife.

02:25:26.250 --> 02:25:28.218
A devout priest

02:25:28.220 --> 02:25:35.826
and his seed that
he left inside her.

02:25:37.428 --> 02:25:40.163
A great start she'll have.

02:25:40.165 --> 02:25:42.265
Don't you think?

02:25:49.140 --> 02:25:53.176
Or she can grow up with
a good foster family,

02:25:53.178 --> 02:25:57.748
believe that her
father was a good man,

02:25:57.750 --> 02:26:00.484
and that he disappeared

02:26:01.753 --> 02:26:03.754
serving the church,

02:26:03.756 --> 02:26:06.022
in his blind loyalty

02:26:06.024 --> 02:26:08.058
and unwavering devotion.

02:26:11.929 --> 02:26:16.900
You can save your pity
for your wife, Jack!

02:26:17.034 --> 02:26:18.902
She had plans.

02:26:19.270 --> 02:26:21.905
You weren't on them!

02:26:22.173 --> 02:26:24.908
- How can I believe
anything you say?

02:26:24.910 --> 02:26:27.210
- You don't have that
kind of luxury Jack,

02:26:27.212 --> 02:26:29.212
nonetheless I offer you--

02:26:29.214 --> 02:26:30.046
- lies!

02:26:30.048 --> 02:26:31.948
Tell me something true!

02:26:36.087 --> 02:26:37.154
You

02:26:37.156 --> 02:26:38.488
will

02:26:38.490 --> 02:26:40.457
die.

02:26:41.993 --> 02:26:44.795
Either by your own leave
or by the death penalty

02:26:44.797 --> 02:26:47.931
in humiliation for what
you tried to pull on me

02:26:47.933 --> 02:26:49.900
and my company.

02:26:49.902 --> 02:26:54.171
And afterwards I'll
consider us square

02:26:54.173 --> 02:26:59.376
and your daughter will remain
as ignorant as she is now.

02:27:04.515 --> 02:27:07.584
Jack and Jill went up the hill

02:27:07.586 --> 02:27:10.921
to fetch a pail of water.

02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:15.859
Jill fell down and broke
her crown and Jack--

02:28:18.356 --> 02:28:19.322
- and then,

02:28:19.324 --> 02:28:22.525
I had to clean up everything
he spilled all over the floor,

02:28:22.527 --> 02:28:26.162
even though I didn't
make the big mess.

02:28:29.134 --> 02:28:31.635
- That's not fair.

02:28:31.637 --> 02:28:33.236
- Yeah.

02:28:33.238 --> 02:28:38.942
- So, did you think about
the discussion we had?

02:28:40.411 --> 02:28:42.412
And?

02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:47.484
What do you think?

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:51.154
- I'm a little confused.

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:53.423
- Yes.

02:28:53.958 --> 02:28:57.494
God can be a confusing thing.

02:28:57.929 --> 02:29:00.330
Like all superstitions,

02:29:00.332 --> 02:29:04.200
you may have gotten
too old for them.

02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:05.702
- No.

02:29:05.704 --> 02:29:09.039
I don't get why
you left your king.

02:29:11.944 --> 02:29:14.110
- I was banished.

02:29:14.245 --> 02:29:16.713
I did not leave him.

02:29:17.448 --> 02:29:21.251
- You said you
disagreed with him.

02:29:21.253 --> 02:29:22.619
- Yes.

02:29:22.621 --> 02:29:26.656
- And that you can't go back.

02:29:27.992 --> 02:29:31.161
Why didn't you
just say I'm sorry?

02:29:41.172 --> 02:29:46.343
- The wrong kind of obedience
can be a disobedience

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:51.147
like when someone loses
on purpose playing a game.

02:30:40.598 --> 02:30:47.303
- Can the right kind of
disobedience be an obedience?

02:30:48.606 --> 02:30:51.641
- It most certainly can.

02:30:52.209 --> 02:30:53.810
Atta girl.

02:30:55.212 --> 02:30:59.082
- But how do we know
if it's the right kind

02:30:59.084 --> 02:31:01.418
or the wrong kind?

02:31:05.222 --> 02:31:06.823
- Crafty.

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:09.759
Just like your father.

02:31:09.761 --> 02:31:11.461
- Huh?

02:31:11.662 --> 02:31:13.596
- We just do.

02:31:13.731 --> 02:31:18.368
We're smart enough to figure
that out for ourselves.

02:31:24.708 --> 02:31:26.810
- Are we?

02:31:40.191 --> 02:31:43.626
- Karin! The soda machine
is giving free sodas again.

02:31:43.628 --> 02:31:48.431
You just have to hold down
the button and kick real hard.
