00:07.912 --> 00:11.214
- No peeking, Robby!
- ...13, 14...

00:11.216 --> 00:14.484
Last game, everyone! We've got
Robby's birthday cake soon!

00:14.486 --> 00:16.552
- This way, Wendy ... behind the pool house.
- ...19, 20!

00:16.554 --> 00:19.589
- I've got a better spot.
- Ready or not, here I come!

00:28.500 --> 00:30.033
Wendy?

00:31.036 --> 00:34.871
Wendy!
Come on, the game's over!

00:36.207 --> 00:38.274
<i>Wendy!</i>

00:42.714 --> 00:44.981
Wendy?

00:49.587 --> 00:53.356
So, the secret to this
is to go slow.

00:53.358 --> 00:56.626
This ragu needs love, patience,
and commitment.

00:56.628 --> 00:58.961
I want to eat it. I don't wanna
settle down and have kids with it.

00:58.963 --> 01:00.897
Yeah, well, you should be so lucky

01:00.899 --> 01:04.233
- to find a man as good as my ragu.
- Oh, this is nice.

01:04.235 --> 01:06.469
It's a two-bedroom townhouse
in Arlington.

01:06.471 --> 01:08.571
Or would you rather be closer to D.C.?

01:08.573 --> 01:10.373
You know,
all the wonderful restaurants,

01:10.375 --> 01:12.942
the Kennedy Center,
the National Gallery...

01:12.944 --> 01:14.461
Yeah, okay, where...
wherever, just as long as

01:14.462 --> 01:17.146
I don't have to pretend
to be a Redskins fan.

01:17.148 --> 01:18.881
- Taste.
- Okay.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.717
- How is it?
- That is good.

01:21.719 --> 01:23.419
- No!
- That's bad.

01:23.421 --> 01:26.122
- It needs salt!
- Okay.

01:26.124 --> 01:28.191
Listen, you're gonna be
400 miles away.

01:28.193 --> 01:30.893
Trust me, you're gonna want
the taste of home cooking.

01:30.895 --> 01:31.828
- Okay.
- Salt it.

01:31.830 --> 01:34.331
Jane, you should really
explore all these different

01:34.332 --> 01:36.833
neighborhoods online. I'm gonna
add that to your checklist.

01:36.835 --> 01:38.935
Oka...
I have a checklist?

01:38.937 --> 01:41.871
Yes! I've started a little
relocation journal for you.

01:41.873 --> 01:44.340
Organization is vital
for a successful move.

01:44.342 --> 01:47.288
- I said salt it, not brine it!
- Oh.

01:47.323 --> 01:49.445
Oh, and you'll need to
start a change-of-address list.

01:49.447 --> 01:51.614
And maybe I should teach you
to make the cannoli.

01:51.616 --> 01:54.183
And, of course, you'll have to
contact the DMV and the IRS.

01:54.185 --> 01:55.651
Okay, enough!

01:56.721 --> 01:58.788
I know you two are trying to help,

01:58.790 --> 02:02.158
but I just cannot talk
about this move anymore.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.894
But I thought
you were excited about the move.

02:04.896 --> 02:06.829
I am.

02:06.831 --> 02:08.564
At least, I want to be, but I just...

02:08.566 --> 02:10.666
you know,
when I think about being gone,

02:10.668 --> 02:12.902
I think about
not seeing you both every day.

02:12.904 --> 02:14.837
I just ...
you know, it's tough.

02:14.839 --> 02:17.940
- It sucks!
- Wait, Ma, no.

02:17.942 --> 02:21.410
- Come on, don't do that.
- It's just so far.

02:21.412 --> 02:25.481
- Wh... Not you, too!
- And I'm tried of crying.

02:25.483 --> 02:26.649
Let's make cannoli, okay?

02:26.651 --> 02:29.585
And let's make a list, okay?
We love lists.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.422
Come on, you guys.

02:33.424 --> 02:36.392
If we start,
we're never gonna stop. Okay?

02:39.364 --> 02:43.299
So, ju...
Fine. I'll get the wine.

02:43.301 --> 02:45.560
<i>Want red or white?</i>

03:03.937 --> 03:06.685
7x12 - Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow

03:08.867 --> 03:11.305
Hey, did you get any feedback
from that editor yet?

03:11.307 --> 03:13.912
No, but I may not hear anything
for several weeks.

03:13.914 --> 03:16.118
Okay, you gave him three
chapters to your mystery novel.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.925
- How long does this take?
- Well, he's very busy.

03:18.927 --> 03:21.232
I'm sure I'm not high
on his priority list.

03:21.234 --> 03:23.203
Well, you will be
when he reads it.

03:23.205 --> 03:25.308
Who can resist
a stiletto to the temple?

03:25.310 --> 03:27.080
- Morning.
- Detective.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.216
Where are you going?

03:28.218 --> 03:30.221
Ah, Korsak wanted me
to canvass the neighborhood,

03:30.223 --> 03:33.229
find out if anyone saw anything.
I think he knew the guy.

03:33.231 --> 03:34.634
- The victim?
- Yeah.

03:34.636 --> 03:37.107
He's not showing it,
but he seems pretty upset.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.377
Okay.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.326
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:44.328 --> 03:47.534
Victim was Walter Sokoloff ...
retired carpenter, 77.

03:47.536 --> 03:49.706
Neighbor saw him through
the window and called it in.

03:49.708 --> 03:50.976
Sokoloff...

03:50.978 --> 03:53.182
Wasn't there a case file
that you asked us to review

03:53.184 --> 03:55.154
a couple years ago
that has "Sokoloff" in it?

03:55.156 --> 03:57.761
That's right. It was a young
girl at a birthday party.

03:57.763 --> 03:59.933
Blunt-force trauma,
some DNA was recovered,

03:59.935 --> 04:01.538
but no match in the database.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.975
That was Wendy Sokoloff.

04:02.977 --> 04:06.384
I was dating her older sister, Mary,
when Wendy was murdered.

04:06.386 --> 04:11.029
- The victim is their father.
- You sure you want to be here?

04:11.031 --> 04:13.202
Well, yeah.
It was a long time ago.

04:15.477 --> 04:17.813
Um... any sign of forced entry?

04:17.815 --> 04:21.322
No. Nothing seems
to be missing, either.

04:21.325 --> 04:24.666
Hey, look at this.
Looks like he was 20 years sober.

04:29.480 --> 04:32.352
It also looks like he was
old-school with his contacts.

04:33.825 --> 04:35.661
Probably a number for Mary
in there.

04:35.663 --> 04:37.065
Okay, I'll make the call.

04:37.067 --> 04:41.394
- No, it should come from me.
- Okay.

04:41.411 --> 04:43.314
Matt, can you make sure
to collect and bag

04:43.316 --> 04:45.721
- all the pillows in the house?
- You got it, Dr. Isles.

04:45.723 --> 04:49.030
- You think he was smothered?
- Yes. There's evident cyanosis

04:49.032 --> 04:51.937
and numerous petechial
hemorrhages in the skin,

04:51.939 --> 04:54.176
which is consistent with asphyxia.

04:54.178 --> 04:56.750
<i>And I'm seeing some fibers
around the nose and mouth,</i>

04:56.752 --> 04:58.654
so we'll test that at the lab.

04:58.656 --> 05:00.143
<i>Killer attacks him in the chair,</i>

05:00.144 --> 05:02.732
smoothers him with a pillow.
There's a struggle.

05:02.734 --> 05:05.907
We might be able to find DNA on
his hands or under his fingernails.

05:05.909 --> 05:08.782
Looks like the killer finished
the job right here on the floor.

05:08.784 --> 05:10.720
You know, this doesn't look random.

05:10.722 --> 05:12.258
It looks like he was targeted.

05:13.295 --> 05:15.986
Hasn't this family suffered enough?

05:20.782 --> 05:22.084
<i>I checked the neighborhood.</i>

05:22.086 --> 05:25.593
Sokoloff was well-liked,
no problems anyone knew about.

05:25.595 --> 05:27.598
How's Sergeant Korsak doing?

05:27.600 --> 05:31.074
Well, he says he's fine, but
he seemed pretty shaken up.

05:33.683 --> 05:35.151
How about you?

05:35.153 --> 05:38.393
You still...
okay with everything?

05:38.395 --> 05:41.803
By "everything," I assume you mean
our spontaneous decision

05:41.804 --> 05:44.442
- to change our lives forever?
- Yeah, that.

05:45.614 --> 05:46.949
I feel more than okay.

05:46.951 --> 05:51.394
- I feel great. You?
- Great.

05:52.799 --> 05:54.904
- I can't believe that we're actually
getting married. - I know.

05:54.906 --> 05:57.310
No. We have to tell everyone.
No secrets this time.

05:57.312 --> 06:00.551
Absolutely.
But.. not right now.

06:00.955 --> 06:02.323
Well, the proposal
happened so quick,

06:02.325 --> 06:04.829
I didn't have time
to get you a ring.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.868
Frankie, that's so sweet!

06:06.870 --> 06:08.272
But we can't spend a lot.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.444
We have to pay for the wedding
and the honeymoon ...

06:10.446 --> 06:12.249
I-I promise not to spend a lot.

06:12.251 --> 06:17.530
- But... I want to do it right.
- Fine. You do that,

06:17.532 --> 06:18.866
and I'll handle the honeymoon.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.841
How are you gonna do that?

06:21.843 --> 06:24.481
I don't know.
I'll think of something.

06:24.483 --> 06:26.821
I called Walter's daughter Mary.
She's driving in.

06:26.823 --> 06:29.327
Okay.
I found something interesting.

06:29.329 --> 06:30.999
Walter volunteered
for an organization

06:31.001 --> 06:34.073
- called the Victim Advocacy Group.
<i>- I know them.</i>

06:34.075 --> 06:36.613
Yeah, I interviewed
a murder victim's family

06:36.615 --> 06:39.020
who had a woman from
that group with them.

06:39.022 --> 06:40.456
- She was a counselor or something?
- Yeah.

06:40.458 --> 06:42.529
Their volunteers help and advise
victims' families

06:42.531 --> 06:43.631
through the grief process.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.372
They even offer guidance through
the investigation and trial.

06:46.374 --> 06:48.377
Sounds like Walter never really
got over Wendy's death.

06:48.379 --> 06:50.417
Maybe he figured out a way
to channel that pain

06:50.419 --> 06:51.586
into something good.

06:51.588 --> 06:53.057
Well, let's look into
all the cases he worked.

06:53.059 --> 06:55.296
- Maybe something will pop out.
- All right.

07:00.913 --> 07:04.654
All right, well, just let me know
if you think of anything else.

07:04.656 --> 07:06.091
Thank you very much.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.497
Okay, well,
that was Walter's sponsor.

07:08.499 --> 07:10.937
He said he never heard
of any problems or any threats.

07:10.939 --> 07:12.641
How'd you do
with the victims program?

07:12.643 --> 07:14.045
I might have found something.

07:14.047 --> 07:15.916
That's Vanessa Flores.

07:15.918 --> 07:18.691
<i>Her son was killed six years ago
outside a bar in Roxbury.</i>

07:18.693 --> 07:21.532
The man who shot him
was up for parole last week.

07:21.534 --> 07:24.573
<i>...why I urge you to deny parole.</i>

07:24.575 --> 07:26.980
So, Walter Sokoloff
was her advocate?

07:26.982 --> 07:29.586
He's been with the family
since the time of the murder.

07:29.588 --> 07:30.388
Here it is.

07:30.390 --> 07:31.893
<i>This is bullshit!</i>

07:31.895 --> 07:33.731
<i>Nate said he's sorry!
He's learned his lesson!</i>

07:33.733 --> 07:35.569
That's Wayne Fellows,
the murderer's brother.

07:35.571 --> 07:38.242
<i>Yo, touch me again
and I'll kick your ass.</i>

07:38.244 --> 07:41.350
<i>You ... You think I won't?!
I'll kill you!</i>

07:41.352 --> 07:44.693
All right, well, let's bring Wayne
Fellows in and have a little talk.

07:44.695 --> 07:46.197
<i>Detective Rizzoli?</i>

07:47.302 --> 07:49.773
- Hi.
- Agent Davies. Wh...

07:49.775 --> 07:51.945
- That's the agent from Quantico?
- Mm-hmm.

07:51.947 --> 07:55.755
Uh... uh, this ...
this is Nina Holiday.

07:55.757 --> 07:58.485
This is Agent...
Davies from Quantico.

07:58.487 --> 08:01.214
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure's all mine.

08:01.216 --> 08:04.741
Is there, um, is there
someplace we could talk?

08:04.743 --> 08:07.771
- Yeah.
- Now a good time?

08:09.004 --> 08:10.100
Yeah.

08:10.835 --> 08:12.330
Privately.

08:14.229 --> 08:17.089
Is something wrong?
Is there a problem with the job?

08:17.091 --> 08:18.488
No, no, there's no problem.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.185
It's, um, I mean, it's ...
it's related

08:20.187 --> 08:23.380
but, um...
but, you know, unrelated.

08:23.382 --> 08:26.010
Not helping at all.

08:26.012 --> 08:29.238
Yeah, um, see ...
all right, the thing is, I, um,

08:29.240 --> 08:31.901
I-I was just in town, and I thought,

08:31.903 --> 08:35.263
um, do you have...
time for dinner?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.260
Like, a professional-colleagues dinner?

08:37.261 --> 08:39.589
Just... dinner.

08:39.591 --> 08:41.720
You know, a-a chance
to talk about things.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.883
- What things?!
- Important things.

08:43.885 --> 08:46.100
It's nothing bad.
I promise.

08:46.102 --> 08:48.831
Come on.
We had fun over drinks.

08:48.832 --> 08:49.826
Right?
I mean, didn't we?

08:49.828 --> 08:51.561
We ...
Yeah, we did.

08:51.563 --> 08:53.710
- 'Cause I did.
- I did, too.

08:53.712 --> 08:56.647
Okay.
I thought, "Let's go for 2 and 0."

08:56.649 --> 08:58.674
All right.
Nothing fancy.

08:58.676 --> 09:01.581
- Beer and burgers it is.
- Okay.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.202
Okay.

09:12.331 --> 09:14.303
Petechial hemorrhaging is present

09:14.305 --> 09:17.402
in the mucosa of the lips
and the interior of the mouth.

09:17.404 --> 09:20.807
There's also evidence of
pulmonary edema due to suffocating.

09:20.809 --> 09:22.345
Hi. Did you find anything?

09:22.347 --> 09:25.842
Well, time of death is somewhere

09:25.844 --> 09:27.886
between 6:00 and 9:00
yesterday evening.

09:27.888 --> 09:30.622
The victim's hands were wiped
clean, but I did find trace

09:30.623 --> 09:32.796
- underneath the fingernails.
- DNA?

09:32.798 --> 09:35.003
Uh, hopefully.
It's being processed now.

09:35.005 --> 09:38.445
So, there was also substantial
bruising on the chest ...

09:38.447 --> 09:41.253
<i>about the size and shape we'd
expect if the killer was on top,</i>

09:41.255 --> 09:44.128
- using a knee to hold the victim down.
- Mm-hmm.

09:44.130 --> 09:46.200
Okay. So you'll get back to me
with the trace results?

09:46.202 --> 09:47.670
Of course.

09:51.015 --> 09:55.091
- Everything okay?
- Uh... it's silly.

09:55.093 --> 09:58.033
- I just heard from the editor.
- And?

09:58.035 --> 10:01.509
And he said that my chapters
have potential,

10:01.511 --> 10:03.481
that the science was fascinating,

10:03.483 --> 10:06.657
- the crime was complex.
- Go, Maura!

10:06.659 --> 10:09.030
Well, he also said
that my characters felt flat

10:09.032 --> 10:11.336
and that the setting
didn't really come alive.

10:11.338 --> 10:13.709
All right.
So you spice it up a little bit.

10:13.711 --> 10:15.381
I don't even know how to do that.

10:15.383 --> 10:17.253
And what does he even mean?
What am I supposed to do?

10:17.255 --> 10:19.926
Add more more color
and more smells?

10:19.928 --> 10:21.164
Smell... Yes.

10:21.166 --> 10:23.169
That ... That sounds like
a perfect place to start.

10:23.171 --> 10:25.843
I don't know that I should be
spending all of this time writing.

10:25.845 --> 10:28.216
There are so many other things
I could be doing.

10:28.218 --> 10:30.107
Come on, Maura.
You love writing.

10:30.109 --> 10:33.270
Yeah, but maybe the truth is that
I'm not particularly good at it.

10:33.272 --> 10:36.261
Why? Because you didn't hit it
out of the park on your first try?

10:37.500 --> 10:40.524
I'm wrong until I'm right
on every murder we've got.

10:40.526 --> 10:41.899
Okay, they're bringing in my suspect.

10:41.901 --> 10:43.064
<i>Jane.</i>

10:43.065 --> 10:45.493
Did you really like the chapters
that you read?

10:45.495 --> 10:48.488
- Honestly. No sugarcoating.
- Yes. I did.

10:48.490 --> 10:49.919
But, you know,
who cares what I think?

10:49.921 --> 10:51.781
And who cares what that editor says?!

10:51.783 --> 10:54.244
I mean, if you don't believe
in it, then who else will?

10:54.246 --> 10:56.640
<i>Believe.</i>

10:56.642 --> 10:58.769
Believe, Maura!

10:58.771 --> 11:00.101
<i>Believe!</i>

11:11.449 --> 11:14.209
- Mary?
- Vincent.

11:14.211 --> 11:17.104
My goodness.
I can't believe it's really you.

11:17.106 --> 11:20.165
It's been too long.
I'm so sorry about your father.

11:20.167 --> 11:23.992
- I... I always liked him.
- Daddy liked you, too.

11:23.994 --> 11:27.486
And he never liked any of
my boyfriends.

11:27.488 --> 11:29.382
I'm afraid I have to ask you
some questions.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.279
But there's no reason
we have to do it here.

11:31.281 --> 11:32.474
Do you still drink tea?

11:33.868 --> 11:35.060
Come with me.

11:42.162 --> 11:44.481
Nothing was the same
after Wendy died.

11:44.483 --> 11:47.799
It was like we didn't know
how to be a family without her.

11:47.801 --> 11:49.026
I remember.

11:49.028 --> 11:51.216
You were so sweet those
first couple of months.

11:51.218 --> 11:54.167
Always coming around
even when I told you not to.

11:54.169 --> 11:55.527
I wanted to help.

11:55.529 --> 11:57.949
But I was 18.
I didn't know how.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.570
I'm sure you remember how bad it got.

12:00.572 --> 12:05.513
Dad was falling apart, drinking.
He couldn't hold a job.

12:05.515 --> 12:08.034
Mom tried to be patient,
but it was hard.

12:08.036 --> 12:09.990
That's when Mom and I
moved to Connecticut.

12:09.992 --> 12:13.042
We found a 20-years-sober
chip in his house.

12:13.044 --> 12:14.933
We lost him for a long time,

12:14.935 --> 12:19.212
but eventually,
Dad cleaned up his act.

12:19.214 --> 12:20.539
After he was sober,

12:20.541 --> 12:23.691
he started volunteering
with that victims group.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.046
It became his whole life.

12:26.048 --> 12:28.898
Did he mention anyone
he was having a problem with?

12:28.900 --> 12:30.292
Not to me.

12:30.294 --> 12:33.202
He ever say anything about
a Wayne Fellows?

12:33.204 --> 12:36.780
We didn't really talk about
his victim-advocate work.

12:36.782 --> 12:41.061
He knew it upset me.
Dad never stopped thinking

12:41.063 --> 12:43.568
about Wendy
and what happened to her.

12:43.570 --> 12:47.147
He never stopped looking
for her killer.

12:47.149 --> 12:50.458
But... I couldn't do that.

12:50.460 --> 12:52.097
I couldn't keep dredging it up.

12:52.099 --> 12:54.639
You did what you had to do
to survive.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.079
And now I have to do it
all over again.

13:03.469 --> 13:05.808
I don't even know
a Walter Sokoloff.

13:05.810 --> 13:07.380
You met him at your
brother's parole hearing.

13:07.382 --> 13:10.725
- You threatened to kill him.
- You mean the old man?

13:10.727 --> 13:11.962
Is that what this is about?

13:11.964 --> 13:13.534
What, he file a complaint
or something?

13:13.536 --> 13:16.109
- Where were you yesterday between
6:00 and 9:00 p.m.? - Why?

13:16.111 --> 13:18.787
Because that's when
Walter Sokoloff was murdered.

13:20.927 --> 13:24.135
Look, I said some things,
but I-I didn't hurt him.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.309
- I was just pissed.
- Yeah. We know that.

13:26.311 --> 13:29.252
- That's why you're sitting there.
- You don't understand.

13:29.254 --> 13:30.991
My brother Nathan's
been up for parole twice,

13:30.993 --> 13:32.597
and both times,
the lady and the old man came.

13:32.599 --> 13:34.332
She keeps saying all kinds
of stuff about her son

13:34.334 --> 13:37.335
- so they won't let Nathan out.
- He murdered her son.

13:37.337 --> 13:39.672
It was a bar fight
that got out of hand.

13:39.674 --> 13:41.974
He hates himself for it.
He really does.

13:41.976 --> 13:46.012
Worrying about Nathan being
in jail is just killing my mom.

13:46.014 --> 13:49.049
She doesn't eat.
She barely sleeps.

13:49.051 --> 13:50.751
I don't know how much longer
Ma's gonna last.

13:50.753 --> 13:52.920
<i>Must've made you
really hate Walter Sokoloff ...</i>

13:52.922 --> 13:55.483
him helping to keep your brother
behind bars like that.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.326
- Wait ... you said 6:00 to 9:00?
- Mm-hmm.

13:58.328 --> 14:00.629
I was at the Boathouse all night,
watching the Sox.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.631
- Lots of people saw me.
- Who'd they play?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.935
Damn Yankees.
We kicked their asses, too.

14:07.772 --> 14:09.907
Okay, I need some names.

14:12.511 --> 14:15.507
So, you hadn't seen each other
since you were teenagers?

14:15.509 --> 14:17.139
Now she has grandchildren.
It's crazy.

14:17.141 --> 14:20.071
- And were you two serious?
- We thought we were.

14:20.073 --> 14:21.869
But we lost touch when
she and her mother moved away.

14:21.871 --> 14:23.910
<i>Well, it's so nice
that you got to see her again.</i>

14:23.945 --> 14:26.833
But, ohh, what a sad reason
for a reunion.

14:26.835 --> 14:29.498
Her sister's murder was the first
time I'd ever been close to a crime.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.963
It really got under my skin.

14:31.965 --> 14:34.494
- I think that's why I decided to be a cop.
- Hm.

14:34.496 --> 14:36.593
Hey, Vince.
I'm sorry for interrupting.

14:36.595 --> 14:38.825
I just wanted to make sure
that it was okay with you

14:38.827 --> 14:41.257
if I switched up my work schedule.

14:41.259 --> 14:42.723
Sure. What do you need?

14:42.725 --> 14:45.254
I want to free up my afternoons
so I could take care of T.J.

14:45.256 --> 14:47.652
Well, you know,
with Ron back in the picture

14:47.654 --> 14:51.084
and Tommy and T.J. coming back,
your life sounds very full.

14:51.086 --> 14:52.283
It's never been better.

14:52.285 --> 14:54.015
Working at the Robber's
not fulfilling enough?

14:54.017 --> 14:58.079
I love my job.
I'm just not getting any younger.

14:58.081 --> 15:00.511
I want to do the things
that make me happy.

15:00.513 --> 15:03.043
Yeah, Kiki said I should be
doing the same thing.

15:03.045 --> 15:05.740
Hey, you're the one that keeps
bringing retirement up.

15:05.742 --> 15:07.406
I just want what's best for you.

15:07.408 --> 15:11.504
- What's stopping you, Vince?
- I don't know.

15:11.506 --> 15:14.708
I just can't seem to pull the trigger.

15:15.473 --> 15:16.538
Got to go. It's Jane.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.572
- Okay.
- Sorry.

15:17.574 --> 15:20.106
- Bye, hon.
- See ya.

15:20.108 --> 15:22.641
Yeah, I think
he wants me to be the one

15:22.643 --> 15:26.830
to push him to retire, but I
know it's got to be his decision.

15:28.545 --> 15:31.511
<i>Frankie confirmed
Wayne Fellows' alibi.</i>

15:31.513 --> 15:34.578
Found at least 12 people that
said he was at the bar all night.

15:34.580 --> 15:37.080
Let's hope
Maura found something.

15:37.082 --> 15:40.547
Please tell us you found some DNA,
and I'll... give you 100 bucks.

15:40.549 --> 15:43.238
- I did.
- Oh.

15:43.451 --> 15:46.283
Well, I'm not gonna give you
100 bucks, but I'm really glad.

15:46.285 --> 15:47.784
No take-backs.

15:47.786 --> 15:50.351
We found the DNA in the trace
under the victim's fingernails.

15:50.353 --> 15:51.619
You get an ID?

15:51.621 --> 15:54.503
No, but I did get a hit
when I ran it through CODIS.

15:54.506 --> 15:57.775
- A hit with no name?
- The DNA from our crime scene

15:57.778 --> 16:00.274
matches the DNA
from an unsolved homicide

16:00.276 --> 16:03.369
that I logged into the system
myself a few years ago ...

16:03.372 --> 16:06.220
the DNA found on Wendy's body
in 1975.

16:06.222 --> 16:08.130
The man who killed Walter Sokoloff

16:08.132 --> 16:11.757
is the same man who killed
his daughter 40 years ago.

16:19.345 --> 16:22.355
The party was at the home
of Carol and Oliver Davenport.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.404
The Davenports were old money,
as were most of the other guests.

16:25.406 --> 16:27.424
I thought Wendy was
from your neighborhood.

16:27.426 --> 16:30.326
She was. The Sokoloffs
were from Dorchester.

16:30.328 --> 16:32.831
Wendy was at Stanover Academy
on a scholarship.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.929
One of her classmates
was Robby Davenport.

16:34.931 --> 16:37.264
- So she went to school with the rich kids.
- Yeah.

16:37.266 --> 16:39.768
Walter dropped her off at the party,
but he wasn't invited to stay.

16:39.770 --> 16:43.153
The Davenports didn't associate
with people from our part of town.

16:43.155 --> 16:46.098
Wendy was killed
in the garden behind the shed ...

16:46.100 --> 16:48.195
blunt-force trauma to the head
with a metal object.

16:48.197 --> 16:49.820
A shovel was missing
from the shed ...

16:49.822 --> 16:51.241
assumed to be
the murder weapon.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.746
The Sokoloffs told us that
Wendy was wearing a locket

16:53.748 --> 16:55.303
that was also missing.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.961
Detectives believed
that both the shovel

16:56.963 --> 16:58.687
and the locket
were taken by the gardener.

16:58.689 --> 17:02.007
He was our prime suspect.
He died in 1986, so he's out.

17:02.009 --> 17:06.355
And Maura confirmed that the DNA
came from a Caucasian male.

17:06.357 --> 17:08.080
The adult guests were
sitting around the pool

17:08.083 --> 17:09.508
while the kids played
hide-and-seek.

17:09.510 --> 17:11.068
They alibied each other.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.627
Detectives also cleared
two of the staff

17:12.630 --> 17:15.117
- that were working in the kitchen.
- What about the kids?

17:15.119 --> 17:17.209
Police interviewed them,
but nobody saw anything.

17:17.211 --> 17:18.867
Mostly, they got a lot of crying.

17:18.869 --> 17:21.224
Let's run background checks
on them as adults,

17:21.227 --> 17:23.383
- see if anything pops.
- Got it.

17:23.384 --> 17:26.404
Let's also look at these three again ...
Oliver Davenport,

17:26.405 --> 17:28.860
<i>his two oldest sons,
Garrett and William.</i>

17:28.862 --> 17:30.193
This the same Garrett Davenport

17:30.195 --> 17:32.061
accused of raping that nurse
a few years ago?

17:32.063 --> 17:33.262
Yes, both of the older kids

17:33.264 --> 17:34.496
were in and out of trouble
their whole lives.

17:34.498 --> 17:36.497
Well, Oliver told the police
that both of his sons

17:36.499 --> 17:38.631
were in the study with him
at the time of the murder.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.832
Basically, they're all
each other's alibis.

17:40.834 --> 17:42.401
Oliver's been protecting
his kids all their lives.

17:42.403 --> 17:43.734
Maybe he's still doing it.

17:43.736 --> 17:46.469
But why kill her? There's
no evidence of sexual assault.

17:46.471 --> 17:48.704
Maybe Wendy saw something
that she wasn't supposed to see.

17:48.706 --> 17:50.171
Either way,
we need to talk to them.

17:50.173 --> 17:52.139
Well, I'll see what I can dig up
on the family.

17:52.141 --> 17:53.773
I'll keep looking into Walter's life ...

17:53.775 --> 17:55.408
<i>try to figure out if he did anything</i>

17:55.410 --> 17:58.075
that brought Wendy's killer out
of hiding after all these years.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.476
Keep us updated.

18:06.482 --> 18:09.248
This is everything from 1975.

18:09.250 --> 18:11.416
I performed a review several years ago,

18:11.418 --> 18:13.583
but I want to go over everything again.

18:13.585 --> 18:16.652
Whatever new tests have been
developed, let's use them.

18:16.654 --> 18:20.053
Well, I can analyze the dirt and
the hair in the spectrophotometer.

18:20.055 --> 18:23.489
And I can work up a virtual
3-D reconstruction of the wound.

18:24.458 --> 18:29.793
- The dress has deteriorated.
- We'll be careful.

18:29.795 --> 18:32.294
I just want to analyze
any bodily fluids,

18:32.296 --> 18:35.896
prints, blood ...
whatever it can tell us.

18:35.898 --> 18:40.432
If we can solve oneof these
murders, we can solve both.

18:45.069 --> 18:47.231
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey, honey.

18:47.266 --> 18:48.702
How are you?
You want something to eat?

18:48.704 --> 18:51.638
Ma, I can't stay.
Did you find Gram's earrings?

18:51.640 --> 18:53.105
I did, and I forgot

18:53.107 --> 18:56.641
what terrible taste
your great-grandmother had.

18:58.310 --> 19:00.476
Ooh.
Wow. The stones are nice.

19:00.478 --> 19:02.444
You sure you don't mind
if I take them?

19:02.446 --> 19:04.912
No, I don't mind. They've
been in my drawer for 20 years.

19:04.914 --> 19:06.345
What are you gonna do with them?

19:06.347 --> 19:07.180
Nothing.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.748
- Not for Nina?
- Ma, please, just this once,

19:10.750 --> 19:12.349
can you not ask any questions?

19:12.351 --> 19:15.384
Okay, fine.
Hey, I'm not one to pry!

19:15.386 --> 19:17.852
I'm just saying that if somebody
were to make a ring out of it,

19:17.854 --> 19:20.187
the best place to go
is Tony DePalma.

19:20.189 --> 19:22.822
- Bye, Ma.
- Bye. You're welcome!

19:25.691 --> 19:28.925
Would you tell them
we called ... again?

19:30.360 --> 19:32.893
Secretary says,
"Oliver Davenport isn't here.

19:32.895 --> 19:34.327
And if you have any questions,

19:34.329 --> 19:37.563
you should consider
submitting them in writing."

19:37.565 --> 19:41.231
God, lawyers suck.
You want to give it another hour?

19:43.568 --> 19:44.867
What's that?

19:44.869 --> 19:47.335
Oh, it's a journal I kept
on the Wendy Sokoloff murder ...

19:47.337 --> 19:51.270
<i>just articles, and things I heard,
my own suspicions.</i>

19:51.272 --> 19:52.904
You made this
when you were a teenager?

19:52.906 --> 19:56.272
Yeah. I guess it was my
first murder book, huh?

19:56.274 --> 19:58.074
I never really believed
the gardener did it,

19:58.076 --> 19:59.408
but I couldn't find anyone else

19:59.410 --> 20:00.975
who had a reason
to kill her, either.

20:00.977 --> 20:03.009
I was obsessed.

20:04.246 --> 20:05.978
Persistence makes
a great detective.

20:05.980 --> 20:08.980
- I learned that from you.
- Well, you were born persistent.

20:08.982 --> 20:11.081
Hey, how you feeling about
that FBI job? You excited?

20:11.083 --> 20:14.749
Yeah.
And then I'm completely terrified.

20:14.751 --> 20:18.117
And then I'm confident that it's
the worst mistake I've ever made.

20:18.119 --> 20:19.519
- And then ...
- Sounds exhausting.

20:19.521 --> 20:21.132
It is.

20:22.156 --> 20:23.754
It is.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.922
- You think it's the right move?
- Eh. Don't ask me.

20:26.924 --> 20:30.592
I find making big decisions
harder the older I get.

20:30.594 --> 20:34.327
- What does your gut tell you?
- I won't know unless I try.

20:34.329 --> 20:36.661
I haven't known your instinct
to be wrong very often.

20:39.999 --> 20:43.031
That's not Oliver, but I think
that's Robby Davenport.

20:46.902 --> 20:48.301
<i>Mr. Davenport?</i>

20:48.303 --> 20:50.069
Boston PD. Can we have
a moment of your time?

20:50.071 --> 20:52.136
- Of course.
- We've been trying to reach your father.

20:52.138 --> 20:53.137
We haven't had much luck.

20:53.139 --> 20:55.652
- What about?
- Murder investigation.

20:55.974 --> 20:59.773
- Is there a place we can talk?
- Sure. Come in.

21:02.010 --> 21:04.543
God, this cannot be happening again.

21:04.545 --> 21:07.144
Do you have any idea how Wendy's
death affected our family?

21:07.146 --> 21:09.904
I imagine not nearly as much
as it did the Sokoloffs.

21:11.405 --> 21:14.913
I don't mean to be insensitive.
Mr. Sokoloff dying is horrible.

21:14.915 --> 21:18.798
But Wendy was killed
at our house, at my party.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.467
<i>Okay? It was devastating.</i>

21:20.469 --> 21:22.580
I had anxiety attacks
for years afterwards.

21:22.582 --> 21:24.965
Please understand we're not
trying to be insensitive,

21:24.967 --> 21:27.179
but it is important
that we speak to your father.

21:27.181 --> 21:29.224
Dad retired shortly
after my mother passed.

21:29.226 --> 21:31.552
We're actually in the process
of selling the estate.

21:31.554 --> 21:34.411
He doesn't really
see anyone anymore.

21:34.413 --> 21:35.808
Just a few questions.

21:35.810 --> 21:38.534
Dad wouldn't know anything
about Walter Sokoloff's death.

21:38.536 --> 21:41.194
They barely knew each other,
and that was decades ago.

21:41.196 --> 21:42.557
Even so, we need to speak to him,

21:42.559 --> 21:45.386
and we also need to speak
to William and to Garrett.

21:46.116 --> 21:49.107
My brothers?
What do they have to do with this?

21:49.109 --> 21:51.368
They were at the birthday party, too.
We're just being thorough.

21:53.099 --> 21:56.854
Unfortunately, my father
and my brothers are unavailable.

21:59.749 --> 22:01.011
When your father retired,

22:01.013 --> 22:02.939
did it become your job
to protect the Davenports?

22:02.941 --> 22:04.435
My family has nothing to hide.

22:04.437 --> 22:06.630
Well, we could get
DNA samples from your father

22:06.631 --> 22:08.824
and your brothers and then we
could clear them all quickly.

22:08.826 --> 22:11.451
If you've got a warrant,
we're happy to comply.

22:11.453 --> 22:13.612
I'm afraid I have an appointment.

22:13.614 --> 22:16.110
<i>My secretary will see you out.</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:21.160
I understand looking out for the family.

22:21.162 --> 22:23.647
When did that include
protecting murderers?

22:27.679 --> 22:28.906
<i>No, no, no, no.</i>

22:28.908 --> 22:30.204
You want to know the worst thing

22:30.206 --> 22:32.697
about being undercover
with a bunch of neo-Nazis?

22:32.699 --> 22:34.759
I'm guessing it's hard
to choose the worst.

22:34.761 --> 22:36.687
It is. But the smell.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.247
Honestly, it's like these
guys never met a shower.

22:39.249 --> 22:41.142
- Ugh!
- This probably isn't

22:41.144 --> 22:44.500
the most romantic first-date
conversation.

22:44.502 --> 22:46.728
Yeah, so, how many times
have you been shot?

22:46.730 --> 22:50.119
- Ugh. That was bad. Sorry. Sorry.
- No, no, no. It's...

22:50.121 --> 22:51.151
Um...

22:51.153 --> 22:52.713
I know I ...
I said "beer and burgers,"

22:52.715 --> 22:54.109
and this isn't beer and burgers.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.672
No, no, no.
No. It's delicious.

22:55.674 --> 22:57.301
Thank you ... really.

22:58.135 --> 22:59.230
All right, look, um...

22:59.232 --> 23:01.923
you're about to start
a new job, all right?

23:01.925 --> 23:03.087
A new city,

23:03.089 --> 23:05.847
your colleagues are people
you've never met before.

23:05.849 --> 23:09.437
- It's not easy. I know.
- Mm-hmm.

23:11.434 --> 23:15.256
I like you, Jane.
I really like you.

23:15.258 --> 23:18.116
<i>I knew that
from the minute we met.</i>

23:18.118 --> 23:20.897
- But...
- But what?

23:22.075 --> 23:24.233
What "but"? Why does
everyone always have a "but"?!

23:24.235 --> 23:25.962
<i>What?
It's ... it's your wife?</i>

23:25.964 --> 23:27.891
Your girlfriend?
Your boyfriend?

23:27.893 --> 23:30.351
- What? What "but"?
- It's none of the above.

23:30.353 --> 23:33.112
But... the last thing I'd
ever want to do is make you

23:33.113 --> 23:35.871
feel awkward, start off
on the wrong foot at work.

23:35.873 --> 23:37.998
So I thought I'd come here,

23:38.000 --> 23:40.526
<i>tell you how I feel on your turf,
where there's no pressure.</i>

23:40.528 --> 23:42.520
And if you're not interested,
I'll ... I'll back off,

23:42.522 --> 23:46.515
and I promise we will forget
this conversation ever happened.

23:47.543 --> 23:48.904
Thank you.

23:49.937 --> 23:54.058
You know, my priorities have
always been family and work.

23:54.060 --> 23:58.082
I know. That's one of the
many things I admire about you.

23:58.084 --> 23:59.711
Well, that ...
that means I don't really

23:59.713 --> 24:03.114
have a lot of time for relationships.

24:04.335 --> 24:05.998
I understand.

24:10.934 --> 24:13.755
You know, um...

24:13.757 --> 24:15.606
maybe I could make time.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.082
- Five.
- Sorry?

24:25.084 --> 24:27.419
- Been shot five times.
- You've been shot five times?

24:27.421 --> 24:29.822
- Five times. How about you?
- I've only been shot twice.

24:29.824 --> 24:31.125
<i>Twice is good.
Twice is sexy.</i>

24:31.127 --> 24:33.448
No, one doesn't really count
'cause I shot myself.

24:34.286 --> 24:36.266
- I-I shot myself on purpose.
- What?

24:36.268 --> 24:40.787
- Yeah, well, it's ... it's a long story.
- That's not good.

24:43.448 --> 24:45.093
Jane!
You ready?

24:45.096 --> 24:47.918
- Oh!
- Hi.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.598
- Hello.
- I ... I'm Cameron.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.515
I'm guessing you must be Maura.

24:51.517 --> 24:55.414
Cameron. Cameron...
Davies?

24:55.416 --> 24:57.700
- Agent Davies?
- Yeah. Nice to meet you.

24:57.702 --> 24:59.549
What a pleasant surprise.

24:59.551 --> 25:02.205
I hope you're...
enjoying Boston?

25:02.207 --> 25:06.274
Oh, yeah. Um...
very much so.

25:06.276 --> 25:07.315
<i>Hey.</i>

25:08.965 --> 25:10.812
Sorry, sorry.
Hi.

25:10.814 --> 25:12.258
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.375
Um, okay, I just need
to get my stuff.

25:14.377 --> 25:17.200
Well, don't hurry on my account.

25:17.202 --> 25:20.090
Oh. Maybe I'll just
hang this up for you.

25:20.092 --> 25:23.851
Looks like it didn't quite
make it all the way upstairs.

25:24.598 --> 25:27.830
Um... can we, uh,
take you to your hotel?

25:27.832 --> 25:30.432
Yeah, that'd be ... that'd be
great, if Maura doesn't mind.

25:30.434 --> 25:31.732
Oh. No, not at all.

25:31.734 --> 25:33.666
It'll give us a chance
to get to know one another.

25:33.668 --> 25:37.201
- Yeah.
- With your clothes on.

25:37.203 --> 25:41.369
- She's...
- On a roll today. Okay.

25:50.308 --> 25:51.640
You texted?

25:53.343 --> 25:56.109
Whoa!
Is it gonna self-destruct?

25:56.111 --> 25:57.647
Actually, it's working perfectly.

25:57.649 --> 26:00.858
I modified our facial-recognition
algorithm to make a new program.

26:00.860 --> 26:02.832
- What's it doing?
- Automatically registering

26:02.834 --> 26:05.909
for every sweepstakes in the nation
that gives away free trips.

26:05.911 --> 26:09.085
You must really want
to go on vacation.

26:09.087 --> 26:12.498
You remember the missing locket
that Wendy wore to the party?

26:12.500 --> 26:15.808
- Yeah.
- These are new-item alerts.

26:15.810 --> 26:18.250
Walter created tags
for a silver opal locket

26:18.252 --> 26:20.390
on eBay and other resale sites.

26:20.392 --> 26:21.862
They alerted him every time

26:21.864 --> 26:24.203
a locket of that description
was listed for sale.

26:24.205 --> 26:25.809
He was looking for
his daughter's missing locket.

26:25.811 --> 26:27.113
<i>I looked through
his financial records</i>

26:27.115 --> 26:29.789
and found evidence
that he purchased at least 12.

26:29.791 --> 26:32.063
The most recent
was only two weeks ago.

26:32.065 --> 26:36.043
- We didn't find any in the house.
- Maybe the killer took them.

26:36.045 --> 26:38.050
I'll give Mary a call. Maybe
she knows something about it.

26:38.052 --> 26:39.154
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

26:39.156 --> 26:40.760
<i>Hope you win your vacation.</i>

26:42.199 --> 26:45.910
You failed to mention
that Agent Davies was in town.

26:45.912 --> 26:48.685
- It was just dinner.
- And dessert.

26:48.687 --> 26:50.859
Actually, two desserts.

26:50.861 --> 26:52.544
And breakfast.

26:53.270 --> 26:56.129
- He seems very nice.
- Yeah, he is.

26:56.131 --> 26:59.324
Is it something you think you
might want to pursue in Washington?

26:59.326 --> 27:01.354
Who knows what'll happen? But...

27:02.920 --> 27:05.247
- Yeah, I like him.
- Well, good for you.

27:06.547 --> 27:09.553
Um... large brew,
no room, please.

27:09.908 --> 27:13.678
Four pump, no water, soy chai
with cinnamon and nutmeg.

27:15.298 --> 27:17.692
Was there even any coffee in that?

27:17.694 --> 27:18.990
Don't answer.
Who cares?

27:18.992 --> 27:21.885
Okay, last night,
I was thinking about your book.

27:21.887 --> 27:23.648
Oh. When did you have time?

27:24.682 --> 27:29.206
Mm... And I think that you should
just try something different.

27:29.208 --> 27:31.468
- Like what?
- I don't know ... like, um...

27:31.470 --> 27:33.531
like a change of scenery, you know?

27:33.533 --> 27:36.127
Like, go to the library or ...
Thank you.

27:36.129 --> 27:38.989
...write standing up
or eating ice cream, you know?

27:38.991 --> 27:40.419
Like, mix it up a little.

27:40.421 --> 27:41.850
- That's interesting.
- Right?

27:41.852 --> 27:44.179
- Mm-hmm.
- If your pages need to "come alive,"

27:44.181 --> 27:47.673
then, you know, go out and live
a little.

27:47.675 --> 27:50.535
Okay, I got to run.
We're gonna take another shot

27:50.537 --> 27:52.731
at trying to talk
to Oliver Davenport.

27:52.733 --> 27:53.729
I got this.

27:53.731 --> 27:55.427
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

27:55.429 --> 27:58.820
And, hey, don't give up.
Okay?

27:58.822 --> 28:00.417
That's not the Dr. Isles I know.

28:01.318 --> 28:02.813
See ya.

28:07.674 --> 28:09.968
<i>I'm sorry. Mr. Davenport
isn't taking visitors.</i>

28:09.970 --> 28:11.531
Yeah, we just need a few minutes.

28:11.533 --> 28:13.395
<i>You can arrange an appointment
through his office.</i>

28:15.959 --> 28:17.088
Mm, yeah.

28:17.090 --> 28:20.083
So what now?
We can't talk to the family.

28:20.085 --> 28:23.910
We don't have enough for a warrant
to get the Davenports' DNA.

28:23.912 --> 28:26.438
We're not getting any further
than they did back in '75.

28:27.572 --> 28:31.430
That must be the service entrance
that Korsak was talking about.

28:31.432 --> 28:33.261
Looks like
they're moving stuff out.

28:33.263 --> 28:35.523
Yeah...
you can't just walk in there.

28:35.525 --> 28:37.191
I can if I'm invited.

28:37.954 --> 28:40.776
- You got a jacket?
- Yeah.

28:45.677 --> 28:47.860
- How's this?
- It's perfect.

28:49.693 --> 28:51.494
You know what I just realized?

28:51.496 --> 28:53.944
This might be one of the last
cases that we work together.

28:53.946 --> 28:55.237
Oh, no.

28:55.239 --> 28:57.687
Come on. I could become part
of some FBI task force.

28:57.689 --> 29:00.103
I'll swoop in
and make your life a living hell.

29:00.105 --> 29:02.689
- Oh, just like when we were kids.
- Exactly!

29:02.691 --> 29:03.913
Janie.

29:05.651 --> 29:07.316
I wouldn't be a detective
if it wasn't for you.

29:07.318 --> 29:08.351
You know that, right?

29:09.589 --> 29:12.391
You did that on your own, Frankie.
That was all you.

29:14.196 --> 29:16.332
- Be right back.
- All right.

29:19.706 --> 29:23.143
Everything must be handled
with meticulous care.

29:23.145 --> 29:26.617
They'll need more blankets.
Can you grab those and take them in?

29:26.619 --> 29:27.651
- These?
- Yes, please.

29:27.653 --> 29:29.087
Take them inside,
all the way to the back.

29:29.089 --> 29:30.724
The statues are in the salon.

29:48.690 --> 29:50.090
Here you go, Mr. Davenport.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.262
<i>I'll get some water
and be right back.</i>

29:59.809 --> 30:01.243
Mr. Davenport?

30:02.480 --> 30:05.585
Hi. My name is Jane Rizzoli.

30:05.587 --> 30:09.390
I'd like to... ask you
a few questions.

30:09.392 --> 30:10.559
Carol?

30:11.930 --> 30:14.533
No, no, no.
Uh, my name is Jane.

30:14.535 --> 30:16.454
You're here!

30:17.306 --> 30:18.706
Can I help you?

30:20.178 --> 30:22.146
Yeah, um...

30:22.148 --> 30:25.552
I'm Detective Rizzoli from
Boston Police Department.

30:25.554 --> 30:27.356
I was hoping to speak
to Mr. Davenport,

30:27.358 --> 30:29.425
but I see that's not really possible.

30:29.427 --> 30:32.230
- I'm afraid he's getting worse.
- Carol?

30:38.577 --> 30:40.652
I've missed you.

30:40.948 --> 30:42.423
I missed you, too.

30:45.942 --> 30:48.156
- M-May I?
- Of course.

30:50.761 --> 30:54.312
It's okay.
It's okay.

30:56.179 --> 30:58.111
It's okay.

31:00.751 --> 31:03.106
I have to go, but I'm
gonna come back, okay?

31:03.108 --> 31:05.779
- Ohh.
- Okay?

31:07.786 --> 31:09.753
<i>- Thanks.
- Of course.</i>

31:23.457 --> 31:25.916
Maura processed
Oliver Davenport's DNA.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.237
It's a familial match to our killer's.

31:28.239 --> 31:30.454
So our murderer was definitely
one of the Davenports.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.966
<i>I just heard back from ICE.</i>

31:31.968 --> 31:34.112
Garrett's passport was scanned
leaving the country

31:34.114 --> 31:36.182
the morning after Walter was killed.

31:36.184 --> 31:37.618
- He may be running.
- Yeah.

31:37.620 --> 31:39.655
I'll start a warrant
for Garrett and William's

31:39.657 --> 31:42.292
phone numbers and credit cards.

31:42.294 --> 31:43.695
That's Mary.

31:43.697 --> 31:45.699
I asked her to look for
the lockets that Walter bought.

31:45.701 --> 31:47.803
Okay, um, Frankie, will you
get in touch with Interpol,

31:47.805 --> 31:50.408
- have them keep tabs on Garrett.
- Already on it.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.344
But with the money these guys
have, they could be anywhere.

31:52.346 --> 31:53.479
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

31:53.481 --> 31:54.982
She found a key
to a safety-deposit box.

31:54.984 --> 31:56.117
I'm meeting her at the bank.

31:56.119 --> 31:57.319
- No lockets?
- No.

31:57.321 --> 31:58.922
She told me earlier
that none of the family

31:58.924 --> 32:00.358
even knew
where that locket came from.

32:00.360 --> 32:03.063
- They didn't give it to her?
- No. First time Walter saw it

32:03.065 --> 32:05.067
was when he dropped
Wendy off at the party.

32:05.069 --> 32:06.502
She told him it was a gift.

32:06.504 --> 32:08.405
- From who?
- She wouldn't say.

32:08.407 --> 32:09.708
She jumped out of the car
and ran off

32:09.710 --> 32:11.748
to join the other kids
before Walter got an answer.

32:11.783 --> 32:14.082
- Can you handle that warrant?
- Yeah, sure. Go on.

32:23.033 --> 32:25.736
Dr. Isles.
We're ready to begin the tests.

32:25.738 --> 32:28.707
Kent, would you feel comfortable
managing the M.E.'s office

32:28.709 --> 32:33.082
- for a few weeks if the need arose?
- Of course.

32:33.084 --> 32:37.122
- Are you planning on going somewhere?
- I'm not sure.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.905
Let's see what this dress can tell us.

32:46.741 --> 32:49.511
<i>- She sounds wonderful.
- Oh, Kiki's the best.</i>

32:49.513 --> 32:51.280
<i>I don't know
how she ended up with me.</i>

32:51.282 --> 32:54.787
Oh, stop. I think
she's a very lucky woman.

32:54.789 --> 32:56.189
It's exciting, isn't it?

32:56.191 --> 32:58.593
You and Kiki, me with my grandkids.

32:58.595 --> 33:02.367
It's like a whole new chapter
of our lives is just starting.

33:02.369 --> 33:04.470
All the paperwork
seems to be in order.

33:04.472 --> 33:07.040
If I could just get
your signature here...

33:09.212 --> 33:14.517
Very good.
Box 1263.

33:14.519 --> 33:16.420
- Do you have the key?
- Uh, yes.

33:17.624 --> 33:19.058
Thank you.

33:25.770 --> 33:27.436
I'll give you some privacy.

33:36.052 --> 33:39.554
I told you.
He never stopped looking.

33:39.556 --> 33:42.325
He tracked the ownership of
the lockets back through years.

33:42.327 --> 33:45.129
Hoping it would lead him
to Wendy's murderer.

33:45.131 --> 33:47.633
These look like purchase dates
on the front.

33:51.708 --> 33:52.807
What's wrong?

33:52.809 --> 33:54.476
Nina said he bought a locket
two weeks ago.

33:54.478 --> 33:56.245
It's on the list, but it's not here.

33:57.617 --> 33:59.417
That's why he was killed, wasn't it?

33:59.419 --> 34:01.454
Daddy did it.

34:03.324 --> 34:06.127
He finally found the right locket.

34:12.472 --> 34:15.340
- What's going on?
- You're just in time.

34:15.342 --> 34:17.409
Okay, let me guess ...
You built a time machine,

34:17.411 --> 34:20.214
and we're gonna go back to 1975
and solve the crime.

34:21.251 --> 34:23.753
You know, Jane, it's your sarcasm
I'm gonna miss most of all.

34:23.755 --> 34:27.158
But actually,
you're not far from wrong.

34:27.159 --> 34:31.764
We're performing a vacuum metal
deposition test on the dress.

34:31.766 --> 34:34.735
The VMD technology's only been
available in the past few years.

34:34.737 --> 34:37.272
<i>VMD has the potential
to lift prints from surfaces</i>

34:37.274 --> 34:40.143
that were impossible to analyze
at the time of the murder.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.580
- Like fabric.
- Exactly.

34:44.786 --> 34:46.600
Ooh.

34:47.623 --> 34:48.922
Sorry.

34:48.925 --> 34:51.560
Now, first, we will expose the dress

34:51.562 --> 34:54.464
to an aerosol of evaporated gold.

34:54.466 --> 34:56.868
- Real gold?
- Yes.

35:00.175 --> 35:04.479
Okay, the secondary
exposure is to evaporated zinc.

35:04.481 --> 35:06.482
The zinc will attach itself to the gold

35:06.484 --> 35:09.008
anywhere that there might be prints.

35:12.059 --> 35:16.063
- And then... nothing happens.
- Wait for it.

35:24.745 --> 35:27.913
- It worked.
- Those don't look like a man's prints.

35:27.915 --> 35:31.902
No. They look like
a little boy's prints.

35:33.424 --> 35:35.592
A kid did this to another kid?

35:43.472 --> 35:45.907
Maura confirmed the prints
match Robert Davenport's.

35:45.909 --> 35:48.577
Good thing prints don't change
as you age.

35:48.579 --> 35:50.447
Not for Robert Davenport.

35:52.185 --> 35:53.785
<i>I told you he's not in today!</i>

35:53.787 --> 35:54.920
Where is he?

35:54.922 --> 35:56.723
I don't know, but if he calls,
I can tell ...

35:56.725 --> 35:58.559
This is a homicide investigation.

35:58.561 --> 36:00.328
If I find out
you withheld anything from us,

36:00.330 --> 36:02.264
I swear to you I will make it
my personal mission

36:02.266 --> 36:03.633
to see you behind bars.

36:04.870 --> 36:07.772
Security called and told Mr.
Davenport that you were coming up.

36:07.774 --> 36:09.809
- He went out back.
- Where'd he go?

36:09.811 --> 36:11.211
Uh, h-he told me to make sure

36:11.213 --> 36:13.347
that the company helicopter
was prepared for takeoff.

36:13.349 --> 36:15.018
- Where is that?
- Jackson Airfield.

36:15.020 --> 36:18.630
- It's just a couple ...
- We know where it is.

36:22.241 --> 36:25.918
Notify the state police air wing
to get a unit in the air now!

36:40.248 --> 36:43.963
- We're gonna lose him.
- Shit!

36:51.431 --> 36:52.566
<i>There he is ... straight ahead!</i>

36:52.568 --> 36:54.106
Get us in the air!

36:58.394 --> 36:59.730
<i>Put it down!</i>

37:01.206 --> 37:02.174
Go! Go!

37:02.176 --> 37:04.050
<i>Boston Police.</i>

37:04.052 --> 37:07.582
<i>Return to the ground
and surrender your passenger.</i>

37:08.605 --> 37:10.008
Come on!
Get us in the air!

37:10.010 --> 37:12.418
<i>I repeat ...
surrender your passenger.</i>

37:12.420 --> 37:13.858
Put it down!

37:27.017 --> 37:28.087
You have the right to an attorney.

37:28.089 --> 37:30.631
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

37:30.633 --> 37:33.008
Do you understand these rights
as I've read them to you?

37:33.010 --> 37:36.088
I'll take that as a "Yes."
Officer.

37:38.768 --> 37:41.779
Looks like that persistence
finally paid off.

37:52.494 --> 37:55.807
- You were right.
- Yay! I was right!

37:55.809 --> 37:57.949
I love being right!
What was I right about?

37:57.951 --> 38:01.230
All of it ... not giving up on
being a writer, mixing it up.

38:01.232 --> 38:02.870
Good! So you're gonna finish
writing the book?

38:02.872 --> 38:04.678
I am.
And I'm taking your advice.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.223
I think a change of scenery
is exactly what I need.

38:07.225 --> 38:09.064
My editor wants the book
to come alive,

38:09.066 --> 38:10.537
and I know just how to do it.

38:10.539 --> 38:12.345
I'm going to Paris for a month.

38:12.347 --> 38:14.219
- Paris?
- Of course.

38:14.221 --> 38:16.127
I mean, the whole book
takes place in France.

38:16.129 --> 38:19.275
So I'll soak up the atmosphere,
live among the people.

38:19.277 --> 38:23.962
I didn't actually mean
a library... in France

38:23.964 --> 38:25.334
<i>when I suggested it.</i>

38:25.336 --> 38:27.711
But great!
That sounds great.

38:27.713 --> 38:29.084
I'm so excited.

38:29.086 --> 38:30.925
- Hi!
- Hey.

38:30.927 --> 38:34.206
- Hi, Maura.
- Oh. Hello.

38:34.208 --> 38:37.453
Wha... I'm guessing
you're canceling dinner.

38:37.455 --> 38:40.098
Yeah. Just got called out
to advise on a case.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.441
I'm on a plane for Philly in an hour.

38:42.443 --> 38:44.349
Yeah, the monkey suit
kind of gave it away, so...

38:44.351 --> 38:46.928
Sorry. I can honestly
tell you there's nothing

38:46.930 --> 38:49.217
I'd rather be doing
than having dinner with you.

38:50.009 --> 38:52.719
- Rain check?
- Yeah.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.761
Yeah, it'll be my treat ...
in Washington.

38:54.763 --> 38:57.737
- It's a date.
- Okay.

38:57.739 --> 38:59.366
I'll, uh...

39:00.380 --> 39:02.217
I'll... show you where to get

39:02.219 --> 39:04.891
- the best beer and burgers in town.
- Okay.

39:06.198 --> 39:08.435
- Nice seeing you again.
- Have a safe flight.

39:08.437 --> 39:10.406
- Thanks.
- Bye.

39:14.054 --> 39:17.446
- That one might be a keeper.
- I know! Unhh!

39:17.481 --> 39:18.967
Okay.

39:20.306 --> 39:23.213
Well, it appears my evening is free.
Dirty Robber?

39:23.215 --> 39:26.156
<i>Oui.
Ã‡a a l'air fantastique.</i>

39:26.158 --> 39:29.966
C'est von b... blblblblblbl.
All right.

39:31.206 --> 39:33.109
- Oh, he's cute.
- I know!

39:33.111 --> 39:34.413
Whew.

39:39.665 --> 39:41.167
- Here you go.
- Oh.

39:41.169 --> 39:44.109
I may have to go back
to my afternoon shift.

39:44.111 --> 39:48.905
- You people are exhausting.
- But we're excellent tippers.

39:49.086 --> 39:51.151
- You need some help?
- No, that's okay.

39:51.240 --> 39:53.498
- Janie will help me.
- Why do I got to help?

39:53.500 --> 39:56.607
You want me to send you
frozen ragu every week?

39:56.609 --> 39:58.881
Yes, I do.
Yep. Yes, ma'am.

39:58.883 --> 40:00.051
Okay.

40:01.992 --> 40:03.243
I'll be right back.

40:03.496 --> 40:04.852
<i>Oh. I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

40:04.853 --> 40:06.310
- I ... I was just ...
- I won!

40:06.312 --> 40:07.148
- What?
- I won!

40:07.150 --> 40:10.635
- You ... You won what?
- Our honeymoon.

40:10.637 --> 40:13.450
I entered a sweepstakes and
won a trip for two to Antigua.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.160
Wait ... you actually won a sweepstakes?

40:15.162 --> 40:16.367
Can you believe it?

40:16.369 --> 40:20.189
I mean, well, technically,
I did enter 5,762 of them

40:20.191 --> 40:23.206
using a program I created,
but we won!

40:23.208 --> 40:26.089
Well, I just picked up this.

40:27.264 --> 40:30.715
Frankie!
It's so beautiful!

40:31.957 --> 40:34.336
- Ohh.
- So...

40:34.338 --> 40:36.681
- So we'll tell everybody now.
- Yeah. Let's do it.

40:36.683 --> 40:38.660
- Okay.
- Come on.

40:41.192 --> 40:43.118
Hey.

40:43.321 --> 40:44.962
<i>I'm very glad you are all here.</i>

40:44.964 --> 40:48.448
I want you to be the first to know ...

40:48.752 --> 40:51.332
I filed for my retirement today.

40:51.334 --> 40:52.901
<i>- Ooh!
- Yay!</i>

40:52.992 --> 40:55.588
<i>- Congratulations!
- Yay!</i>

40:55.590 --> 40:57.298
Congratulations, Sergeant.

40:57.300 --> 40:59.678
I hope you're ready for me
to be around a lot more.

40:59.680 --> 41:01.723
Oh, yes. I can't wait.

41:02.798 --> 41:04.137
- Later?
- Later.

41:04.139 --> 41:08.160
Well, cheers to Vince Korsak ...

41:08.162 --> 41:11.780
the greatest partner...

41:11.782 --> 41:15.132
husband, boss, colleague...

41:16.341 --> 41:18.753
...friend a person could ever ask for.

41:19.458 --> 41:20.496
Hear, hear.

41:20.498 --> 41:21.904
<i>Cheers.</i>

41:21.906 --> 41:23.178
Cheers.

41:24.521 --> 41:26.865
<i>Tout est en train de changer.</i>

41:26.867 --> 41:29.413
Really?
Is this how it's gonna be now?

41:29.515 --> 41:31.827
"Everything is changing."

41:33.203 --> 41:35.279
That's true in every language.

41:35.382 --> 41:39.570
