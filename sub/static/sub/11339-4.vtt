Why is he doing this?

00:33.064 --> 00:34.881
Is that enough?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.593
Ellie just got placed
with a foster family,

01:04.679 --> 01:06.513
so, fingers crossed.

01:06.564 --> 01:08.065
Oh, that's great.
I'm happy for her.

01:08.149 --> 01:09.766
We got a case
in Akron, Ohio.

01:09.851 --> 01:11.401
Two couples
killed in two weeks.

01:11.486 --> 01:13.186
One a week?

01:13.237 --> 01:15.739
That's not much
of a cooling-off period.

01:15.823 --> 01:17.574
Scott and Kathy Hartway.

01:17.659 --> 01:19.726
Found in their car
in an isolated spot.

01:19.777 --> 01:22.296
The son of Sam had a short
cooling-off period.

01:22.363 --> 01:24.114
He also attacked couples
in cars.

01:24.198 --> 01:25.949
Yeah, but the first couple
were killed in their house.

01:26.034 --> 01:28.068
Robert and Allison Keppler.

01:28.119 --> 01:29.786
In both cases,
the husbands were killed

01:29.871 --> 01:31.254
with a silenced
9-millimeter,

01:31.339 --> 01:32.873
the wife was stabbed
multiple times.

01:32.924 --> 01:34.458
He crosses racial lines.

01:34.542 --> 01:36.076
And socio-economic ones.

01:36.127 --> 01:37.794
The Kepplers lived
in an upscale neighborhood,

01:37.879 --> 01:39.463
the Hartways
were blue collar.

01:39.547 --> 01:41.915
That's a big change
in crime scenes, car versus house.

01:41.983 --> 01:43.934
Two radically
different M.O.s

01:44.018 --> 01:45.469
not to mention
he subdues two people.

01:45.553 --> 01:46.970
That takes
a lot of skill.

01:47.055 --> 01:48.638
There's no indication
of how he overwhelms them.

01:48.723 --> 01:51.808
There's no antemortem
bruising. He doesn't
use a blitz attack.

01:51.893 --> 01:53.777
Well, he's got
a 9-millimeter.

01:53.861 --> 01:54.778
He doesn't need to.

01:54.862 --> 01:55.779
How about signs
of forced entry

01:55.863 --> 01:56.813
to the car or the house?

01:56.898 --> 01:58.482
No. But Akron P.D.
did find this.

02:00.284 --> 02:02.102
Handcuffs.
So he restrains the men

02:02.153 --> 02:03.754
and saves the real
savaging for the wife.

02:03.821 --> 02:04.938
Is this right?

02:04.989 --> 02:08.108
They found a used condom
on both the husbands?

02:08.158 --> 02:09.743
And both had Viagra
in their systems

02:09.794 --> 02:11.078
and neither had a prescription.

02:11.129 --> 02:13.413
So the unsub
gives the men Viagra

02:13.464 --> 02:16.383
and then forces them
to have sex before
he kills them.

02:16.450 --> 02:18.618
And given the timetable,
he's gonna strike again soon.

02:18.669 --> 02:20.721
We fly to Akron tonight.
Wheels up in 3 hours.

02:25.176 --> 02:27.811
Garcia. What's that?

02:27.895 --> 02:28.945
My go bags.

02:29.013 --> 02:30.480
Where are you going?

02:30.548 --> 02:32.049
With you, hopefully.

02:32.116 --> 02:35.452
Sir, I think we're
all still reeling
since jj left,

02:35.520 --> 02:37.137
and we are a man down,

02:37.205 --> 02:39.322
and you need
a communications liaison.

02:39.407 --> 02:40.323
Garcia--

02:40.408 --> 02:41.474
sir, please, hear me out.

02:41.526 --> 02:43.309
My job overlapped
with JJ's the most.

02:43.361 --> 02:46.113
I created that program
that she used
to present cases.

02:46.164 --> 02:47.814
When you guys
were out in the field,

02:47.865 --> 02:50.283
she coordinated
your needs through me.
It makes sense.

02:50.334 --> 02:52.986
Garcia, there are aspects
of the job for which
you have no training.

02:53.037 --> 02:55.321
You're totally right,
but I--I'm willing to learn.

02:55.373 --> 02:57.323
I'll learn how to interact
with families

02:57.375 --> 03:00.677
and local law enforcement
and the media.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.262
Sir, I'm willing to tone
down my wardrobe choices.

03:02.330 --> 03:03.580
I'm ready to make
that sacrifice

03:03.648 --> 03:06.049
if you just please
give me a chance.

03:07.602 --> 03:09.669
All right.
We could explore this
on a trial basis.

03:09.720 --> 03:11.071
We'll see how things go.

03:11.139 --> 03:12.856
Are you up to speed
on the case?

03:12.940 --> 03:14.524
Yes.

03:14.592 --> 03:16.843
I'm ready now.
Can you be ready in 3 hours?

03:16.894 --> 03:19.629
See you on the plane.

03:25.536 --> 03:26.870
Ok.

Abraham Lincoln said,

04:03.550 --> 04:05.835
"whatever you are,
be a good one."

04:05.886 --> 04:08.471
I'm just waiting on a few
last-minute details.

04:08.522 --> 04:09.889
Let'go ahead
and get started.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.340
I keep bumping on the fact

04:11.392 --> 04:13.676
that he makes
a married couple have sex

04:13.727 --> 04:14.844
before he kills them.

04:14.895 --> 04:16.478
What is he accomplishing
with that?

04:16.529 --> 04:17.779
You know, the stabbing
of the wives

04:17.848 --> 04:19.180
is almost certainly
piqueristic.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.817
The unsub gets sexual
gratification

04:20.868 --> 04:22.017
from penetration
with a knife.

04:22.069 --> 04:23.519
Most piquerists
are impotent--

04:23.587 --> 04:25.621
men like Albert Fish,
Iain Scoular,

04:25.689 --> 04:26.856
Andrei Chikatilo--
so for him,

04:26.907 --> 04:28.958
it could be a substitute
for sex.

04:29.025 --> 04:32.027
The unsub could also
be playing a mind game.

04:32.079 --> 04:33.663
Neither shot
to the husband is clean,

04:33.714 --> 04:35.665
so they have to watch what
he's doing to their wives

04:35.716 --> 04:37.199
as they're dying.

04:37.251 --> 04:38.835
So this guy challenges
their manhood

04:38.902 --> 04:40.203
by forcing them to have sex,

04:40.270 --> 04:41.871
and then mocks them
with the overkill.

04:41.922 --> 04:43.372
That kind
of psychological torture

04:43.424 --> 04:44.707
makes him a sexual sadist.

04:44.758 --> 04:45.875
It would explain
the amount of control

04:45.926 --> 04:47.477
he exhibits
over the crime scene--

04:47.544 --> 04:49.512
the handcuffs, the condoms,
the silenced weapon.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.980
He plans out every detail.

04:51.047 --> 04:53.349
If he's that precise,
he would be just as precise

04:53.417 --> 04:55.351
in his victimology.

04:55.402 --> 04:56.819
But he's all over the map

04:56.887 --> 04:58.387
in terms of class and race.

04:58.439 --> 04:59.856
Well, there must be
something else

04:59.907 --> 05:01.491
about the couples
that attracts him.

05:01.558 --> 05:02.992
Something that
he couldn't learn

05:03.059 --> 05:04.560
by stalking them
anonymously.

05:04.611 --> 05:07.663
Maybe the couples
met the unsub before.

05:07.731 --> 05:10.566
Rossi and Reid, will you
handle the family interviews?

05:10.617 --> 05:13.336
Morgan and Prentiss,
go to the latest crime scene.

05:13.403 --> 05:14.787
We need to learn as much
as we can about him,

05:14.872 --> 05:18.574
so let's really pin down
the M.O.

05:20.243 --> 05:21.577
Well, look at you,

05:21.628 --> 05:22.879
look at you.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.680
Meet your new
communications liaison.

05:24.748 --> 05:27.183
Trial communications
liaison.

05:27.250 --> 05:29.685
Garcia, I don't get
to say this often,

05:29.753 --> 05:32.588
but I had no idea
there was this side of you.

05:32.639 --> 05:35.475
Well, I figure since I'm
going to have to interact

05:35.559 --> 05:37.360
with the mass populace,
I should dress

05:37.427 --> 05:39.529
in the traditional costume
of a mere mortal.

05:39.596 --> 05:42.215
Ow. Ow.

05:42.282 --> 05:44.150
Oh, it's my contact.
What's wrong?

05:44.234 --> 05:46.652
It keeps getting weird
and...Huh.

05:46.737 --> 05:48.621
There it goes.

05:48.705 --> 05:49.622
No.

05:49.706 --> 05:51.073
Yes. No.

05:51.125 --> 05:52.608
Ow.

06:00.551 --> 06:01.884
Detective Crowley?

06:01.952 --> 06:03.886
Hi.
Miss Garcia.

06:03.954 --> 06:05.638
Yeah.
Thanks for coming.

06:05.722 --> 06:08.123
And she emailed
pictures of you guys.

06:08.175 --> 06:10.059
Agents Hotchner, Rossi,

06:10.126 --> 06:11.894
and Dr. Reid, right?

06:11.962 --> 06:13.796
It's doctor, not Agent.
She was specific
about that.

06:13.847 --> 06:15.982
What else was she
specific about?

06:16.066 --> 06:17.316
Everything
your team needed.

06:17.401 --> 06:18.568
I sent her a list
of family members

06:18.635 --> 06:19.735
who'd be willing
to talk,

06:19.803 --> 06:21.237
and your boards
are over there,

06:21.304 --> 06:22.321
all ready for you
to set them up.

06:22.406 --> 06:23.823
I even got the push pins
you asked for.

06:23.907 --> 06:24.824
Excuse me.

06:24.908 --> 06:26.576
Are you miss Garcia?

06:26.643 --> 06:28.110
Mr. Keppler. Hi.

06:28.162 --> 06:29.111
Hi.

06:29.163 --> 06:30.530
This is
Detective Crowley.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.448
He'll show you
to the interview room.

06:32.499 --> 06:33.649
Hello, sir.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.751
Right this way.

06:35.819 --> 06:37.420
He is such a sweet man.

06:37.487 --> 06:39.922
You contacted the family
members already?

06:39.990 --> 06:41.174
Yes. Only two responded
back immediately.

06:41.258 --> 06:42.708
That's Robert Keppler's
dad,

06:42.793 --> 06:44.493
and then Scott Hartway's
mom will be here
in about an hour.

06:44.545 --> 06:45.711
Is that enough time?

06:45.779 --> 06:46.779
Yes. Perfect.

06:46.847 --> 06:47.964
Ok. I'm gonna set up
the boards

06:48.015 --> 06:49.632
unless you need
something else.

06:49.683 --> 06:51.000
Great.
No, we're good.
Thank you.

06:52.219 --> 06:54.554
And you were worried.

06:54.638 --> 06:55.972
Ok, thank you.

06:56.023 --> 06:57.640
So he has a gun,

06:57.691 --> 06:59.675
he gains the upper hand
immediately.

06:59.726 --> 07:01.310
He keeps it trained
on the wife

07:01.361 --> 07:04.146
so the husband has no choice
but to surrender.

07:04.198 --> 07:05.681
Where does he confront them?

07:05.732 --> 07:08.017
Not the parking lot.
Too many variables

07:08.068 --> 07:10.570
for someone this controlled.

07:10.654 --> 07:13.489
He could have been
lying in wait
in the backseat, though.

07:13.540 --> 07:15.041
No.

07:16.493 --> 07:18.193
I mean, if they
were facing forward,

07:18.245 --> 07:20.663
the unsub's back here
down low,

07:20.714 --> 07:23.082
he pops up
with his gun,

07:23.166 --> 07:25.051
there's no chance
for them to fight back.

07:26.202 --> 07:29.505
He could have used
a Slim Jim to get in.

07:29.556 --> 07:31.173
That wouldn't leave
any marks.

07:31.225 --> 07:32.174
Yeah, but here's
the real trick.

07:32.226 --> 07:34.010
How did he force
two people

07:34.061 --> 07:35.044
to have sex
at gunpoint?

07:35.095 --> 07:36.512
With Viagra, apparently.

07:36.563 --> 07:38.180
Viagra's a vasodilator.

07:38.232 --> 07:39.682
It takes at least
30 minutes

07:39.733 --> 07:41.350
to get the blood vessels
to relax properly.

07:41.401 --> 07:44.219
I mean, Scott's
fight or flight response
would have kicked in.

07:44.271 --> 07:46.555
His heart's racing,
his blood's flowing
to all his extremities,

07:46.607 --> 07:48.241
but not the right one.

07:48.325 --> 07:49.609
Maybe he got them to relax.

07:49.693 --> 07:51.444
He tells them he'll let them
live if they do this.

07:51.528 --> 07:53.529
This guy has to control
everything.

07:53.580 --> 07:55.414
That would include
the environment, right?

08:01.038 --> 08:04.123
Oh, he turned the heat
all the way up.

08:04.207 --> 08:07.176
He didn't want them
getting cold?

08:10.797 --> 08:12.465
Radio announcer:
105.5--

08:13.717 --> 08:15.351
This station wasn't
one of the presets.

08:15.418 --> 08:17.303
That means
he tuned it for them.

08:17.387 --> 08:19.305
It's almost like
he went out of his way

08:19.373 --> 08:21.023
to make sure
they were comfortable.

08:21.091 --> 08:22.308
A sexual sadist
wouldn't do that.

08:22.359 --> 08:25.144
We need to take a look
at the first crime scene.

08:26.229 --> 08:27.763
Can you walk us

08:27.814 --> 08:31.834
through a typical day
in your son's life?

08:31.902 --> 08:33.369
What do you mean?

08:33.436 --> 08:35.236
The man we're looking for

08:35.289 --> 08:37.438
may very well have met
Robert and Allison.

08:37.491 --> 08:39.408
Can you tell us
what they liked to do?

08:39.458 --> 08:41.844
I can tell you
those two were married.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.212
To their jobs.

08:43.279 --> 08:46.281
He was lawyer,
and she was a pediatrician.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.668
They went to work,

08:48.752 --> 08:51.120
they came home.

08:51.171 --> 08:52.621
That was their day.

08:52.673 --> 08:54.557
So he was driven.

08:54.624 --> 08:57.843
Scott was at the Post Office
by 7:00 every morning.

08:57.928 --> 09:02.798
He had his eye on
that branch manager office.

09:02.849 --> 09:05.568
He wanted to run
the whole zip code.

09:05.635 --> 09:07.136
So did he have enemies
at work?

09:07.187 --> 09:10.606
Robert stepped on toes
to close a deal, I suppose,

09:10.657 --> 09:14.010
but he was shooting for v.P.
By the end of the year.

09:15.478 --> 09:17.613
He--he'd have made it, too.

09:17.664 --> 09:19.815
Was he that way
his entire life?

09:19.883 --> 09:23.419
Class president
4 years in a row.

09:23.486 --> 09:26.339
So many all-americans...

09:29.543 --> 09:32.545
He ran out of room
on his varsity jacket.

09:32.629 --> 09:35.264
What about college?

09:35.331 --> 09:38.333
Well, top of his class
at Harvard.

09:38.385 --> 09:42.722
Made "Law Review" at Yale.

09:42.806 --> 09:45.141
I was very proud.

09:45.208 --> 09:46.942
So both victims
were alpha males?

09:47.010 --> 09:49.345
It's the only trait
we could find that
connects the couples.

09:49.413 --> 09:51.681
We know that female type
isn't specific
to this unsub,

09:51.748 --> 09:52.948
but what if this is?

09:53.016 --> 09:55.184
Typically, alpha males
only attack other alphas.

09:55.235 --> 09:56.685
That's how the unsub
sees himself.

09:56.737 --> 09:59.488
These men are
the only competitors
he takes seriously.

09:59.539 --> 10:01.457
And the overkill
on the wives
is expression

10:01.524 --> 10:02.691
of control
in alpha male terms.

10:02.743 --> 10:04.026
He's proving his
dominance over his rival

10:04.077 --> 10:05.294
by obliterating
their mate.

10:05.361 --> 10:07.246
We need more details
about these men's lives.

10:07.330 --> 10:09.999
I'll have Garcia pull up
more personal information.

10:10.050 --> 10:11.867
Detective, have you seen
Ms. Garcia?

10:11.918 --> 10:13.085
She's outside
talking to a reporter.

10:13.170 --> 10:15.471
Guy from the local paper
wanted a quote from the FBI.

10:15.538 --> 10:16.922
Excuse me.

10:17.007 --> 10:19.008
No comment.

10:19.059 --> 10:20.209
Off the record, then.

10:20.260 --> 10:22.377
Is the FBI assisting
the Akron police

10:22.429 --> 10:23.979
in the couple killer case?

10:24.047 --> 10:25.881
Ok, first of all,
no comment means no comment.

10:25.932 --> 10:27.433
Second of all, that name
of the killer--

10:27.517 --> 10:29.885
you came up with that name.
We didn't come up
with that name.

10:29.936 --> 10:31.053
Well, forget the name.
The name's gone.

10:31.104 --> 10:32.538
Just, uh, give me
some background

10:32.606 --> 10:34.556
and we'll hold the story
until you give me
the green light.

10:34.608 --> 10:35.941
You'll hold the story?

10:36.026 --> 10:37.359
Absolutely.

10:37.411 --> 10:38.828
Have you cleared that
with your editor?

10:38.895 --> 10:40.362
Uh...Of course.

10:40.414 --> 10:41.864
Can you get him
on the phone?

10:41.915 --> 10:46.368
And the hold also applies
to your blog
that the paper hosts?

10:46.420 --> 10:48.537
Right. That.

10:48.588 --> 10:50.239
You sneaky son of a--

10:50.290 --> 10:52.074
you'll have your story
when the Akron police
make an arrest.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.576
Until then, the FBI has
no comment, as Ms. Garcia
stated. Thank you.

10:57.580 --> 11:00.182
He lied. He lied to me.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.935
No, he just counted on
you not asking
the right questions.

11:03.019 --> 11:05.104
Why didn't you check with me
before you talked to him?

11:05.188 --> 11:07.056
I looked everywhere
and I couldn't find you.

11:07.107 --> 11:09.191
And I figured it was
one of those things

11:09.259 --> 11:12.311
that you would just
count on me to handle.

11:12.395 --> 11:13.512
Garcia, I appreciate
the initiative,

11:13.580 --> 11:15.080
but when it comes to
dealing with the press,

11:15.148 --> 11:16.532
let me handle things
for now.

11:16.599 --> 11:17.867
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

11:17.934 --> 11:19.318
I need all the credit card
and phone records

11:19.386 --> 11:21.153
for all the husbands.
We think the unsub
is targeting them first.

11:21.238 --> 11:22.271
Thank you.
Ok.

11:22.322 --> 11:24.824
Hotch, there's something
you need to see.

11:24.908 --> 11:27.376
This is the second crime scene.

11:27.443 --> 11:29.545
The unsub took the Hartways
to lovers lane.

11:29.612 --> 11:31.881
Then he turned the heat up
in the vehicle

11:31.948 --> 11:34.500
and tuned the radio
to a soul music station.

11:34.584 --> 11:37.452
This is the first crime scene.
Al Green was in the CD player,

11:37.504 --> 11:38.771
candles had been lit.

11:38.839 --> 11:40.222
He's staging the scene.

11:40.290 --> 11:41.590
Control is critical to him.

11:41.641 --> 11:43.375
We know this.
But to a different end

11:43.443 --> 11:44.793
than we initially thought.

11:44.845 --> 11:46.395
These murders
are about the fantasy,

11:46.462 --> 11:48.848
only the fantasy isn't
sadistic, it's romantic.

11:48.932 --> 11:50.349
Well, we profiled
from the interviews

11:50.417 --> 11:52.168
that he's picking
the husbands first.
How's that romantic?

11:52.235 --> 11:54.403
Alpha males marry
the most attractive females.

11:54.470 --> 11:57.573
Once he meets the husband,
he knows the wife
is gonna fit his needs.

11:57.641 --> 11:59.158
We know this unsub
is impotent,

11:59.226 --> 12:01.660
but what we're seeing here
isn't the usual
psychological block

12:01.745 --> 12:03.863
keeping him from getting
aroused. This is physiological.

12:03.947 --> 12:05.981
How can you be sure
of that?

12:06.032 --> 12:07.533
He brings Viagra
to the crime scenes.

12:07.617 --> 12:08.834
If he wanted,
he could pop a pill,

12:08.919 --> 12:10.019
let the drug
take effect.

12:10.086 --> 12:12.454
Instead, he gives it
to the husbands. Why?

12:12.522 --> 12:14.139
It's not working for him
anymore.

12:14.207 --> 12:15.925
Something definitely
happened to this guy.

12:15.992 --> 12:18.010
Prostate cancer,
surgery, something.

12:18.094 --> 12:20.346
But whatever it was,
it cut him off
from fulfilling his needs,

12:20.430 --> 12:22.648
so he's using the couples
as surrogates.

12:22.716 --> 12:24.783
So why does he make
the husband wear a condom?

12:24.851 --> 12:26.802
Well, we don't know
that connection yet.

12:26.853 --> 12:28.537
He's going to kill
the husbands anyway.

12:28.605 --> 12:30.673
He can't perform
on the wives.
The condoms are redundant.

12:30.740 --> 12:32.825
If the theory's right,
he's acting out a fantasy

12:32.893 --> 12:35.361
in which contraception
plays a key role.

12:35.428 --> 12:37.029
Until we understand
what the role is,

12:37.113 --> 12:38.564
we're not gonna find him.

12:45.071 --> 12:46.872
Uhh!

12:52.128 --> 12:53.695
Uhh!

12:53.747 --> 12:56.582
Uhh!

12:57.667 --> 12:59.001
Uhh!

12:59.052 --> 13:00.052
Aah...

13:04.207 --> 13:05.591
Quick!

13:09.930 --> 13:11.546
Get the--

13:11.598 --> 13:13.432
baby, get the--

13:13.516 --> 13:15.851
aah!

13:15.902 --> 13:16.852
Ohh! No!

13:17.904 --> 13:19.939
Aah!

13:20.023 --> 13:23.359
No! No...

13:23.410 --> 13:24.860
Ohh!

13:24.911 --> 13:28.113
No...No...

13:28.198 --> 13:30.666
Wait.

13:30.733 --> 13:31.867
I'll do what you want.

13:31.918 --> 13:34.036
Just don't hurt me,

13:34.087 --> 13:35.204
please...

13:35.255 --> 13:36.505
Tell me you want me.

13:36.572 --> 13:38.207
I want you.

13:38.258 --> 13:40.209
Say it...

13:40.260 --> 13:42.261
Like you mean it.

13:51.421 --> 13:53.472
I want you.

13:57.477 --> 13:59.812
Do you want me?

13:59.896 --> 14:01.730
You do.

14:01.781 --> 14:04.483
You want me.

14:04.567 --> 14:05.701
You want me.

14:05.768 --> 14:07.736
You want me.

14:07.787 --> 14:09.822
You want me.
Say you want me.

14:09.906 --> 14:11.106
You want me.

14:20.475 --> 14:22.243
I just heard. The unsub
shot both victims last night?

14:22.855 --> 14:24.473
The housekeeper
found them this morning.

14:24.524 --> 14:26.508
His routine was disrupted.
That means he made a mistake.

14:26.559 --> 14:28.610
It also means
he's out of control.

14:28.678 --> 14:31.229
He's enraged.
He's going to attack
again soon.

14:31.314 --> 14:32.981
Paul Wilson, spinal surgeon.

14:33.032 --> 14:34.783
Alpha male
just like the others.

14:34.850 --> 14:36.735
Can you just hold on
for a moment?

14:36.819 --> 14:41.022
The offensive and defensive
wounds all over his body.

14:41.074 --> 14:43.158
He was cuffed
behind his back.

14:43.209 --> 14:44.359
He still put up
a hell of a fight.

14:44.410 --> 14:46.194
Because he knew how.
Look. The wounds extend

14:46.245 --> 14:49.197
from his knees
to the soles of his feet.

14:49.248 --> 14:51.700
That's full-contact
training.

14:51.751 --> 14:53.669
Now, where would learn
something like that?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.304
My assumption would be
a mixed martial arts gym.

14:56.372 --> 14:57.872
M MA has skyrocketed
among the men who want

14:57.924 --> 14:59.474
the most intense
fighting possible.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.476
Which our unsub would.
It could be where he's
finding his victims.

15:01.544 --> 15:03.562
I'll follow up
with the families.

15:09.068 --> 15:11.319
Maybe she went for
the gun in the drawer,

15:11.387 --> 15:13.221
forced the unsub
to shoot her,

15:13.272 --> 15:15.390
and stopped him
from following his ritual.

15:15.441 --> 15:17.492
No, 'cause there was
a muzzle burn on her chest.

15:17.560 --> 15:19.277
He shot her
at pointblank range.

15:19.362 --> 15:21.830
Ok, you're the unsub,
I'm Debra Wilson.

15:21.897 --> 15:25.534
I have to get past you
to get to that gun.

15:25.601 --> 15:28.003
But she takes her robe off.

15:28.070 --> 15:30.622
Now, your 9-millimeter

15:30.707 --> 15:32.657
is right here
at my chest.

15:32.725 --> 15:34.926
What am I doing?

15:37.079 --> 15:38.680
She offered herself to him?

15:38.748 --> 15:40.182
Well, why would she
do that?

15:40.249 --> 15:42.917
Why not lock herself
in the bathroom
or run out the door?

15:42.969 --> 15:45.086
Well, survival isn't
logical, it's instinctual.

15:45.138 --> 15:48.190
Her instincts probably told her
that this was her best shot.

15:48.257 --> 15:51.526
Ok. She's telling herself
she's gonna do
whatever is necessary

15:51.594 --> 15:53.562
to get out of this alive.

15:53.613 --> 15:56.948
So she's just seen
her husband die
in front of her.

15:57.033 --> 15:59.418
Then she comes on
to the unsub?

15:59.485 --> 16:02.270
An overt sexual expression.

16:02.321 --> 16:04.189
Yeah, it's almost flexible.
She's gone from one man

16:04.257 --> 16:06.274
to the next
without hesitation.

16:06.325 --> 16:08.210
He makes the husband
wear a condom.

16:08.277 --> 16:09.778
What does that say
about him?

16:09.829 --> 16:12.297
That he's protecting himself?

16:12.381 --> 16:15.801
It's a sexual scenario
where you're sharing
a woman with another man.

16:15.885 --> 16:17.719
Am I crazy, or could
this guy be a swinger?

16:17.787 --> 16:20.722
He could have been
a part of that scene
until the impotence kicked in.

16:20.790 --> 16:22.791
And now he's just trying
to recreate it.

16:22.842 --> 16:25.560
These couples could have
been his old partners.

16:25.628 --> 16:27.062
Ok, so here's
what I found out.

16:27.129 --> 16:28.730
Only Paul Wilson
trained at an mma gym,

16:28.798 --> 16:30.265
but all the other husbands
worked out regularly,

16:30.299 --> 16:32.567
from the local YMCA
to expensive fitness clubs.

16:32.635 --> 16:35.570
Makes sense. Alpha males
care about their appearance.

16:35.638 --> 16:38.139
The gym is also
a good place
to stalk victims.

16:38.191 --> 16:39.407
It still doesn't
tell us

16:39.475 --> 16:40.909
how he goes from
finding husbands
in a gym

16:40.976 --> 16:42.694
to getting inside
their house.

16:42.779 --> 16:44.663
No, but it does give us
a list from which
we can eliminate.

16:44.747 --> 16:46.114
Yeah, but we've got
a bigger problem here.

16:46.165 --> 16:48.083
The unsub's fantasy
was interrupted.

16:48.150 --> 16:50.669
At the least, he's
hunting again tonight.

16:50.753 --> 16:53.538
At the worst,
he'll escalate
his violence.

16:53.623 --> 16:56.758
Will you ask Crowley
to gather his officers.
We can give the profile.

16:56.826 --> 16:57.759
Garcia.

16:57.827 --> 16:59.160
Yes, sir.

17:00.847 --> 17:04.132
We've got a possible lead
in the husbands' gyms
and health clubs.

17:04.183 --> 17:05.767
I need a list
of everyone in and out.

17:05.835 --> 17:06.935
Ok, so employees
and members.

17:07.002 --> 17:08.353
No, wider than that.
Outside vendors,

17:08.436 --> 17:09.938
maintenance, trainers,
everybody.

17:10.005 --> 17:12.107
That's a lot.
And I'm not done
cataloguing

17:12.174 --> 17:13.525
husbands' records
like you asked me to

17:13.608 --> 17:14.943
'cause I keep
getting delayed.

17:15.010 --> 17:16.194
Delayed how?

17:16.279 --> 17:18.146
Uh, family members
calling back,
cops with questions.

17:18.196 --> 17:19.531
Also, I'm helping Morgan
call swing clubs

17:19.565 --> 17:21.182
'cause we thought
some of the victims
might be swingers.

17:21.233 --> 17:22.534
They're not. By the way,
there's more swing clubs
in Akron

17:22.617 --> 17:23.685
than there really should be.

17:23.736 --> 17:24.953
Garcia, I need you
to prioritize this.

17:25.020 --> 17:26.154
We need to get ahead
of this guy.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.373
He may strike again tonight.

17:28.457 --> 17:32.210
Sir, may I please
bring Kevin Lynch in?

17:32.295 --> 17:33.378
It could help me
get it done like bang.

17:33.462 --> 17:34.863
That's fine,
and if for any reason

17:34.914 --> 17:36.214
you get stuck,
just let me know.

17:36.299 --> 17:37.699
And tell Morgan
and Prentiss

17:37.750 --> 17:38.867
that we're releasing
the profile.

17:38.918 --> 17:40.502
Have them give it to
everybody that they've met

17:40.553 --> 17:41.870
yes, yes, I can do that.
In the swingers community.

17:44.757 --> 17:47.175
Uh, Jehovah's Witnesses?

17:47.226 --> 17:48.209
Oh, no, ma'am. Um...

17:48.261 --> 17:49.227
I'm special Agent Prentiss.

17:49.312 --> 17:50.896
This is
special Agent Morgan.

17:50.980 --> 17:53.148
We're with the FBI.

17:53.215 --> 17:54.850
We heard that you ran, uh,

17:54.901 --> 17:57.185
fabulous fun and over 40?

17:57.236 --> 17:59.387
This is the house.

17:59.438 --> 18:01.356
Phil! The FBI is here!

18:01.407 --> 18:02.858
Oh, come in.

18:02.909 --> 18:04.693
Thank you.

18:04.744 --> 18:07.362
Sir, I totally appreciate
the confidentiality

18:07.413 --> 18:09.364
your gym provides
for its members,

18:09.415 --> 18:11.533
but this is a murder
investigation, so obviously--

18:13.169 --> 18:14.419
Hello?

18:15.621 --> 18:17.038
Uncooperative.

18:18.090 --> 18:20.058
Kevin, honey,
say something helpful.

18:20.126 --> 18:22.076
I'm almost done
with members and employees.

18:22.128 --> 18:23.545
Outside venders are gonna
be tough, though.

18:23.596 --> 18:25.714
It looks like a lot of these
guys are paid under the table.

18:25.765 --> 18:27.382
I know. W-2s are useless.

18:27.433 --> 18:29.784
Look at original
service records only.

18:29.852 --> 18:31.686
What is this operating
system you're working?

18:31.754 --> 18:33.889
The search parameters
are completely backwards.

18:33.940 --> 18:35.590
Ok, first of all,
I created that program,

18:35.641 --> 18:37.559
and second of all,
it is a poor carpenter
and hacker

18:37.610 --> 18:38.560
who blames his tools.

18:38.611 --> 18:39.694
Miss Garcia.

18:39.762 --> 18:42.898
Paul Wilson's family
is here for interviews.

18:42.949 --> 18:44.983
But we're about to
deliver the profile.

18:45.067 --> 18:46.401
There's no one here
to talk to them.

18:46.452 --> 18:47.819
Well, they're here.

18:47.904 --> 18:51.206
Uh...Can--can you ask them
to wait?

18:51.273 --> 18:53.107
Ok.

18:53.159 --> 18:54.108
Pen, are you talking to me?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.109
Kevin, compile.

18:56.662 --> 18:57.946
Detective?

18:57.997 --> 18:59.714
Yeah?

18:59.782 --> 19:02.133
I'm sorry.
I'll talk to them.

19:05.421 --> 19:07.839
Oh, I miss you, JJ.

19:07.924 --> 19:10.258
This unsub is
an emasculated alpha male

19:10.309 --> 19:11.593
with a near
obsessive-compulsive

19:11.644 --> 19:13.929
level of control
in his behavior.

19:13.980 --> 19:15.981
And because of
the repetition of details

19:16.065 --> 19:18.633
at the crime scenes,
we know that his ritual
is essential to him.

19:18.684 --> 19:21.186
These patterns are how
he maintains dominance

19:21.270 --> 19:23.304
in a world he feels
powerless in,

19:23.356 --> 19:25.306
both sexually and socially.

19:25.358 --> 19:27.359
The man we're
looking for
is a troilist.

19:27.443 --> 19:29.160
Do you know
what that is?

19:29.245 --> 19:32.747
It means that he gets off
on staging a scene
and participating in it.

19:32.815 --> 19:34.783
Such as recording
sexual acts on camera

19:34.834 --> 19:37.085
or coming to parties
like yours.

19:37.152 --> 19:39.287
The point is
the performance.

19:39.338 --> 19:41.373
Do you know
who his partner is?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.374
Uh, partner?

19:42.458 --> 19:44.125
When he comes
to the parties.

19:44.176 --> 19:46.160
He has to bring
a female companion

19:46.212 --> 19:47.495
or he wouldn't
get in the door.

19:47.563 --> 19:49.798
See, swing clubs
are a matriarchy.

19:49.849 --> 19:51.750
My primary goal
as a hostess

19:51.817 --> 19:53.802
is to make sure other women
feel safe and secure.

19:53.853 --> 19:57.022
There has to be at least
as many women as men.

19:57.106 --> 19:59.391
Actually, we hadn't
considered that.

19:59.475 --> 20:01.142
What else do you know
about him?

20:01.193 --> 20:03.395
Paul Wilson's attack
showed him how
physically weak he was,

20:03.479 --> 20:04.946
and Debra Wilson's enticement

20:05.014 --> 20:07.399
reminded him of how futile
his fantasies were.

20:07.483 --> 20:08.566
And as a result of this,

20:08.651 --> 20:10.568
this unsub is what we call
decompensating.

20:10.653 --> 20:11.569
Now,
what does that mean?

20:11.654 --> 20:12.904
We use it to describe
the collapse

20:12.989 --> 20:15.690
of ocd patterns that
mentally ill patients
use to cope.

20:15.741 --> 20:17.292
Once one fails,
they generally all do.

20:17.359 --> 20:20.078
In this case, the unsub's
ritualized fantasy
has stopped working,

20:20.162 --> 20:22.297
and that makes him
incredibly dangerous.

20:22.364 --> 20:23.748
So what was his fantasy?

20:23.816 --> 20:26.501
Two men, one woman--
how would that work?

20:26.552 --> 20:28.586
Well, he comes with
his female companion.

20:28.671 --> 20:31.256
Then he'd most likely
invite a man in.

20:31.340 --> 20:32.590
Wait a minute.

20:32.675 --> 20:34.426
This guy is an alpha male.

20:34.510 --> 20:37.679
Wouldn't he be
too possessive
to share his partner?

20:37.730 --> 20:39.898
Sure. Unless he was married.

20:39.982 --> 20:41.099
Well, why married?

20:41.183 --> 20:44.235
Oh, because the erotic
charge of the role play

20:44.320 --> 20:46.071
is the consensual cheating.

20:46.155 --> 20:47.555
You don't control
a girlfriend

20:47.606 --> 20:50.075
the way you control a wife.

20:50.159 --> 20:52.027
The husband chooses
his wife's partner for her.

20:52.078 --> 20:53.528
Usually not married.

20:53.579 --> 20:55.697
It makes the cheating hotter.

20:55.748 --> 20:57.032
Then at a certain point,

20:57.083 --> 20:58.366
he steps in.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.869
And shows his sexual
superiority.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.403
He proves to the room
and his wife that
he's the only one

21:02.455 --> 21:03.755
who can satisfy her.

21:03.823 --> 21:07.075
Until his impotence
destroyed his ability
to do that.

21:07.126 --> 21:09.177
Suddenly he's not the only
one questioning his manhood,

21:09.244 --> 21:10.411
she is, too.

21:10.463 --> 21:12.580
So maybe
she cheated on him,
or maybe she left,

21:12.648 --> 21:15.249
but either way,
his wife was his first
loss of control.

21:15.301 --> 21:16.801
And if he's decompensating,

21:16.886 --> 21:19.721
she's the pattern
he'll attack next
as part of his breakdown.

21:19.772 --> 21:21.189
Her or women like her.

21:21.256 --> 21:22.941
The end result
of decompensation

21:23.025 --> 21:24.526
is a temporary
psychotic break.

21:24.593 --> 21:27.195
He'll revisit old patterns
to see if they still work.

21:27.262 --> 21:28.763
And when he finds
that they don't,

21:28.814 --> 21:30.431
he'll be compelled
to destroy them

21:30.483 --> 21:32.600
and anyone
engaging in them.

21:51.620 --> 21:52.720
Hi.

21:52.788 --> 21:53.888
How are you?

21:54.957 --> 21:56.958
Oh, excuse me.

22:00.646 --> 22:02.564
Hello, Leslie.

22:02.631 --> 22:04.732
James.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.634
What a pleasant
surprise.

22:06.685 --> 22:08.570
Where's your wife?

22:08.637 --> 22:11.022
Maryann's coming later.

22:14.977 --> 22:17.311
Well, you know the rules
of my house.

22:17.363 --> 22:18.947
She's right behind me.

22:18.998 --> 22:20.815
I swear.

22:20.866 --> 22:22.333
Well, she better be.

22:22.418 --> 22:25.253
♪ Tick tock... ♪

23:36.251 --> 23:38.469
Are you almost done?

23:38.554 --> 23:40.638
I can't look at this
any longer.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.423
Almost, ma'am.

23:42.474 --> 23:44.125
The gunman tonight,
did you know him?

23:44.193 --> 23:45.209
James.

23:45.277 --> 23:47.879
He and his wife Maryann
were fixtures here

23:47.947 --> 23:49.180
a year ago.

23:49.248 --> 23:50.798
Then they just
stopped coming.

23:50.866 --> 23:52.300
Do you have a last name?

23:52.368 --> 23:54.819
No. We don't share
personal details like that.

23:54.904 --> 23:57.104
So you have sex,

23:57.156 --> 23:59.791
but you don't ask
for last names?

23:59.875 --> 24:02.660
All of the victims
here tonight were men.

24:02.728 --> 24:03.828
Do you happen to know why?

24:03.913 --> 24:05.330
No.

24:05.414 --> 24:06.915
Do you know
if he had the chance

24:06.966 --> 24:09.116
to shoot any women?

24:09.168 --> 24:11.286
I was in the playroom
with my friend.

24:11.353 --> 24:13.638
And we locked the door
when the shooting started.

24:13.722 --> 24:15.289
And he came in,

24:15.341 --> 24:18.509
and he just looked at me
like I was nothing.

24:18.594 --> 24:22.146
So, no, no, I have no idea
what he was after.

24:22.231 --> 24:25.483
I'm just glad it wasn't me.

24:25.567 --> 24:27.518
Ms. Sanders,
if the door was locked,

24:27.603 --> 24:30.104
how did he get in?

24:30.155 --> 24:33.157
This was the last victim.

24:33.242 --> 24:35.977
The unsub came from
the living room into here.

24:36.028 --> 24:38.646
Morgan says the hostess
locked herself in here.

24:38.697 --> 24:42.033
It didn't seem
to slow him down.

24:42.117 --> 24:45.319
This is a deadbolt.
The unsub could have easily
shot his way through.

24:45.371 --> 24:46.871
He picked the lock?

24:46.956 --> 24:49.207
He'd only do that
out of habit.

24:49.291 --> 24:51.342
The deadbolt's designed
for security.

24:51.427 --> 24:54.012
It takes expertise
to get past that.

24:54.096 --> 24:55.213
You think he's a locksmith?

24:55.297 --> 24:56.898
We knew he was stalking
his victims at the gym,

24:56.966 --> 24:58.716
but we never knew how
he got into their lives.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.101
But when you're working out,

25:00.169 --> 25:02.303
where's the one place
you leave everything personal?

25:02.354 --> 25:04.839
In a locker.
Once the unsub
finds an alpha male,

25:04.890 --> 25:07.225
he can pick the lock,
get their address
off their driver's license,

25:07.309 --> 25:09.360
and duplicate their keys
in his work van outside.

25:09.445 --> 25:11.145
That's the missing piece
to his m.O.

25:11.196 --> 25:13.948
He got everything
he needed from these men
before they left the shower.

25:14.016 --> 25:16.701
Garcia's already ruled out
gym employees and members.

25:16.785 --> 25:17.952
How's he getting in?

25:18.020 --> 25:19.287
Could be a third-party vendor

25:19.354 --> 25:20.555
called in to install
the lockers.

25:20.622 --> 25:22.573
And called back when
someone loses their key.

25:22.658 --> 25:25.376
All right.
Come back to the station.
We'll work this up.

25:25.461 --> 25:29.530
Garcia, I need you
to pull all the locksmiths

25:29.581 --> 25:31.632
that the gym
contracts out to.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.134
Oh, that's gonna
take some time.

25:33.201 --> 25:34.201
Why?

25:34.253 --> 25:36.004
Because I'm still
gathering the vendors,

25:36.055 --> 25:39.140
and not all the websites
list the trainers
that work there.

25:39.207 --> 25:40.391
Of course I called them,
did you call them?

25:40.476 --> 25:42.376
But some were cooperative
and some weren't, so I--

25:42.428 --> 25:43.945
Garcia, I told you
to come to me
if you got stuck.

25:44.013 --> 25:46.731
Look, you know usually
I can do this kind of thing
in no time,

25:46.815 --> 25:49.417
but this office
is a revolving door
of people bugging me,

25:49.485 --> 25:51.469
and I cannot do
two jobs at once!

25:55.491 --> 25:57.425
Oh, my God, sir,
I'm so sorry.

25:57.493 --> 26:00.762
Garcia, there are 8
new victims as of tonight,

26:00.829 --> 26:02.747
and more people
are going to die.

26:02.831 --> 26:04.415
I need you to shut out
all distractions

26:04.500 --> 26:06.250
and give me
everything you've got.

26:06.335 --> 26:08.102
Yes, sir. I'm here.
I'm present. Hit me.

26:08.170 --> 26:10.288
The unsub's a locksmith.
I need employee rolls--

26:10.372 --> 26:11.739
of lock and key companies.
I'm so on it.

26:11.790 --> 26:12.874
Thank you.

26:16.962 --> 26:18.296
Yeah.
Hotch.

26:18.380 --> 26:21.049
We need to rethink
this unsub's decompensation.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.234
We thought his wife
would be the next
logical target,

26:23.302 --> 26:24.585
especially
if she left him,

26:24.636 --> 26:26.721
but if it's other men,
he could blame them

26:26.772 --> 26:28.272
for breaking up
his marriage.

26:28.357 --> 26:29.607
It's the same
thought process

26:29.691 --> 26:31.776
that started him
hunting alpha males
to begin with.

26:31.860 --> 26:33.778
And what does that tell us
about where he might be going?

26:33.862 --> 26:35.279
Nothing. But it might
tell us where he's been.

26:35.364 --> 26:38.066
Decompensation means
he's returning
to his old patterns,

26:38.117 --> 26:39.067
his old habits.

26:39.118 --> 26:40.785
Maybe
he did this before.

26:40.869 --> 26:42.737
After his wife left,
he sought out
some of her partners

26:42.788 --> 26:43.771
and killed them.

26:43.822 --> 26:45.073
You want to look
at unsolved murders?

26:45.124 --> 26:46.407
Crowley can pull them
for us,

26:46.458 --> 26:48.409
match them based on
the unsub's caliber.

26:48.460 --> 26:51.245
Good. You might also
need to give Garcia a hand
working the locksmith angle.

26:51.296 --> 26:53.581
Is there some reason
she can't cover that
on her own?

26:53.632 --> 26:56.884
She's juggling two jobs.
She might need some help.

27:27.366 --> 27:30.317
Yeah. Yeah, I appreciate that.
Thank you for the information.

27:30.369 --> 27:32.370
Ok. Bye-bye.

27:32.454 --> 27:34.622
How are you holding up?

27:34.673 --> 27:37.458
Um, the gyms found out
about the massacre,

27:37.509 --> 27:40.161
so now they're giving me
information
on the locksmiths,

27:40.212 --> 27:43.564
and that's a whole other
can of worms. And...

27:43.632 --> 27:44.699
I'm fine.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.851
Garcia...

27:49.304 --> 27:51.556
Morgan, people are going
to die because of me.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.057
Yes, it is.
That's not true.

27:53.142 --> 27:55.393
JJ did so much.

27:55.477 --> 27:57.562
I am in
so over my head,

27:57.629 --> 27:59.564
I'm swimming--
oh, my God,
I hate these things.

27:59.648 --> 28:00.815
Here, let me help.

28:00.866 --> 28:03.067
Take them out.
Where's your saline?

28:03.152 --> 28:05.119
Front pocket of my bag.

28:10.826 --> 28:13.578
You know what your
only mistake has been
since you started?

28:13.662 --> 28:16.214
Oh, hooray.
More criticism.

28:16.298 --> 28:18.416
You are trying
to replace JJ.

28:18.500 --> 28:19.834
Nobody can replace JJ.

28:19.885 --> 28:22.420
Now take the other one
out, too.

28:22.504 --> 28:26.591
I'm not trying
to replace her.

28:26.675 --> 28:29.677
I'm trying to do this job
the way she'd want it done.

28:29.728 --> 28:31.229
You know what JJ
would want?

28:31.313 --> 28:32.613
She'd want you
to find a way

28:32.681 --> 28:34.932
to do this job
on your own terms.

28:35.017 --> 28:36.267
Play to your strengths.

28:36.384 --> 28:39.103
Ok, all my extensive
knowledge

28:39.188 --> 28:41.722
of operating systems
and Internet protocol

28:41.773 --> 28:43.274
is not really
gonna help me out here.

28:43.358 --> 28:44.725
That's not what
I'm talking about.

28:44.776 --> 28:46.344
What are you talking about?

28:46.411 --> 28:50.081
You need to go O.G.

28:50.165 --> 28:51.415
Original Garcia.

28:54.586 --> 28:56.737
Derek Morgan,
I'm a little blind right now,

28:56.788 --> 28:58.439
but it appears the rough blur
that is you

28:58.507 --> 29:01.676
just threw out my only pair
of contact lenses.

29:02.978 --> 29:04.745
There she is.

29:04.796 --> 29:06.831
I know you.

29:10.469 --> 29:13.387
How often do I tell you
I love you?

29:13.455 --> 29:15.640
Every day. It's implied.

29:15.724 --> 29:18.259
Now...The locksmiths.

29:18.327 --> 29:20.111
Can I help?

29:20.195 --> 29:21.929
You just did.

29:21.980 --> 29:23.864
I know what to do.

29:49.024 --> 29:51.309
Deacon's lock and key.
This is Deacon.

29:51.393 --> 29:55.296
Hello. This is Penny Garcia.
I'm with the phone company.

29:55.347 --> 29:56.814
I paid this month.

29:56.898 --> 29:58.966
Oh, we're the phone
company, so we know that.

29:59.017 --> 30:01.819
I'm calling because
one of your employees
is past due,

30:01.903 --> 30:04.155
and he listed you
as his most recent employer.

30:04.239 --> 30:05.606
I don't have any employees.

30:05.657 --> 30:06.974
Well, that settles
that, then.

30:07.025 --> 30:08.976
I'm just going to turn
this over to the irs.

30:09.027 --> 30:10.761
No, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

30:10.829 --> 30:12.330
I have a few guys
I free-lance out to.

30:12.397 --> 30:13.814
Who are you looking for?

30:13.865 --> 30:15.499
Well, I'm glad you asked,
'cause this is my pickle.

30:15.584 --> 30:18.619
I have a gentleman
that uses a bunch
of different last names,

30:18.670 --> 30:20.487
but he keeps using
the same first name,

30:20.539 --> 30:22.156
James, over and over.

30:22.207 --> 30:25.493
And the password is Maryann
on all of his accounts.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.611
James Thomas.

30:28.880 --> 30:31.048
He wouldn't happen to be
working tonight, would he?

30:31.133 --> 30:32.666
Supposed to.

30:32.718 --> 30:33.851
Didn't show.

30:33.935 --> 30:36.637
Ok. Thank you very much.
Bye-bye.

30:38.390 --> 30:39.390
I got it!

30:39.474 --> 30:41.192
The unsub.
Got what?

30:41.276 --> 30:43.444
His name is James Thomas.

30:43.511 --> 30:45.846
He did work at all the gyms
the husbands went to.

30:45.897 --> 30:47.448
Is that not enough information?
Oh, I have so much more.

30:47.515 --> 30:49.150
Last year he suffered
from a condition called

30:49.201 --> 30:52.703
prostatic hyperdysplasia.
Routine surgery
took a wrong turn,

30:52.788 --> 30:54.455
snip snip, they had to remove
the whole prostate tamale.

30:54.522 --> 30:56.490
Boss says he didn't show up
for work today, but this...

30:56.541 --> 30:57.825
Is his home address.

30:57.876 --> 30:59.860
Garcia, you should have
let me know

30:59.911 --> 31:01.329
before you
contacted his employer.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.330
Otherwise, well done.

31:02.381 --> 31:03.497
We need a SWAT team
at this address.

31:03.548 --> 31:04.865
I'm on it.

31:08.420 --> 31:09.420
Yes.

31:16.645 --> 31:18.229
FBI! We're coming in!

31:19.598 --> 31:21.148
Clear.

31:21.216 --> 31:22.483
Clear.

31:22.550 --> 31:23.484
All clear.

31:23.551 --> 31:25.069
Show me your hands.

31:25.153 --> 31:26.070
Who are you?

31:26.154 --> 31:27.888
Maryann Thomas.

31:27.939 --> 31:29.740
James Thomas' wife?

31:29.825 --> 31:31.158
Where's your husband?

31:31.226 --> 31:32.893
I don't know! He left
for work this morning.

31:32.944 --> 31:35.329
There's a gun locker
in the closet. It's empty.

31:35.397 --> 31:37.564
Get up. You're gonna
help us find him.

31:41.002 --> 31:44.004
Please, tell me
what this is about.

32:01.248 --> 32:04.951
This is who your husband
has killed so far.

32:06.209 --> 32:08.644
Recognize
that last crime scene?

32:08.712 --> 32:11.013
That's Leslie Sanders'
house,

32:11.081 --> 32:13.498
where you and James
used to swing.

32:14.584 --> 32:16.702
James is not a...

32:20.707 --> 32:22.207
He wouldn't do that.

32:22.275 --> 32:23.642
He would, Maryann.

32:23.693 --> 32:27.029
He would because
he knows he's not
the father of your baby.

32:27.097 --> 32:29.281
That's not true.
James is the father.

32:35.455 --> 32:36.989
She's not going
to give him up.

32:37.040 --> 32:38.324
She's the wife
of an alpha male.

32:38.375 --> 32:39.858
She depends on him
psychologically.

32:39.909 --> 32:42.361
Is there any chance that
the unsub is the father?

32:42.412 --> 32:44.496
Garcia said
the prostate surgery
was over a year ago,

32:44.547 --> 32:46.665
and there's no record
of insemination.

32:46.716 --> 32:48.500
So how do we get her
to admit it?

32:48.551 --> 32:50.302
We need to ground her
back into reality,

32:50.370 --> 32:51.670
give her something
to hold on to for truth.

32:51.721 --> 32:53.305
Did you get those files
we asked for,

32:53.373 --> 32:54.306
the unsolved murders?

32:54.374 --> 32:56.392
Yeah. I can have them here
in 5 minutes.

32:56.476 --> 32:58.177
Great, thanks.
If the unsub did kill
someone in those files,

32:58.228 --> 33:00.012
it's most likely
the father of her child.

33:00.080 --> 33:02.698
If it's an old swinging
partner, he'd be easy
to track down.

33:02.766 --> 33:04.350
That's risky.
If we show her the files
and he's not in there,

33:04.401 --> 33:05.401
we could lose her for good.

33:05.468 --> 33:08.070
Yeah, but if the father
is in there,

33:08.154 --> 33:10.072
it could shake her loose.

33:10.156 --> 33:13.692
That baby is the only thing
she would prioritize
over her husband.

33:13.760 --> 33:15.494
I think I can do it.
I can get her
to cooperate.

33:15.561 --> 33:16.495
How?

33:16.563 --> 33:17.830
Right now, two alpha
males are in there

33:17.897 --> 33:19.365
attacking her marriage.
She'll react the same way

33:19.416 --> 33:20.916
to anyone challenging
her husband's dominance.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.452
But I'm not a threat.
I think she'll listen to me.

33:47.527 --> 33:51.613
So, I read this pretty
fascinating theory recently.

33:51.698 --> 33:54.783
It said that humans weren't
designed to be monogamous,

33:54.868 --> 33:56.485
that in our
hunter-gatherer phase,

33:56.569 --> 33:58.053
women took several mates.

33:58.121 --> 33:59.988
The idea was that
if the men in the tribe

34:00.073 --> 34:01.323
didn't know
who the father was,

34:01.408 --> 34:02.791
they'd all be more
invested in the child.

34:02.876 --> 34:03.826
Interesting, right?

34:03.910 --> 34:04.827
I guess.

34:04.894 --> 34:06.495
Truthfully, your lifestyle

34:06.563 --> 34:08.947
is, um,
it's a sociological marvel.

34:08.998 --> 34:11.833
Don't get me wrong.
I don't judge it or you.

34:11.900 --> 34:16.170
But I do think that
the only reason
you got into that

34:16.239 --> 34:18.556
was to make
your husband happy.

34:18.623 --> 34:21.560
Just like you only got pregnant
after his surgery

34:21.627 --> 34:22.895
to make him happy,

34:22.962 --> 34:25.397
only, I don't think
that it's working.

34:25.465 --> 34:27.399
That's not true.

34:27.467 --> 34:29.967
James is overjoyed
to be a father.

34:30.018 --> 34:31.687
So he didn't change
around, like,

34:31.771 --> 34:33.272
month 4 or 5
of the pregnancy

34:33.322 --> 34:34.523
when you started to show?

34:34.591 --> 34:36.507
He didn't get moody
or withdrawn or anything?

34:38.360 --> 34:39.610
How about last night,

34:39.661 --> 34:42.281
when he came home
with cuts and bruises?

34:42.331 --> 34:44.815
Didn't you ask him
about that?

34:44.868 --> 34:47.319
No.

34:47.370 --> 34:50.255
So, Maryann, I know
this is hard to hear,

34:50.322 --> 34:52.324
but I think
that your pregnancy

34:52.375 --> 34:55.327
drove your husband to try
to recreate those parties

34:55.378 --> 34:57.880
so he could feel
in control again.

34:57.964 --> 35:00.665
Only, instead of swinging,

35:00.717 --> 35:02.217
he's killing people.

35:02.302 --> 35:04.169
Why won't you people
listen to me?

35:04.220 --> 35:06.671
He's not capable
of doing that.

35:06.723 --> 35:08.273
How about killing the man
who got you pregnant?

35:08.341 --> 35:10.008
Do you think
he's capable of that?

35:11.060 --> 35:12.611
No.

35:12.678 --> 35:15.013
Because you'd be lying.

35:15.064 --> 35:16.732
This is his baby.

35:18.902 --> 35:21.653
These files are recent
unsolved murders,

35:21.704 --> 35:24.323
men who have been killed
since you conceived.

35:24.374 --> 35:26.675
Now, if I'm right
about your husband,

35:26.743 --> 35:30.796
I think that the father
of your child
is somewhere in here.

35:32.248 --> 35:34.199
Bob Atkins?
Is it him?

35:34.250 --> 35:36.468
I can't believe this.

35:36.536 --> 35:37.719
James Boyd?

35:37.804 --> 35:39.805
You don't give up,
do you?

35:39.872 --> 35:42.975
You just can't
accept the fact
that my husband and I

35:43.042 --> 35:45.344
love each other.

35:45.395 --> 35:47.729
Yes, we have
an unconventional
marriage,

35:47.814 --> 35:49.214
but that's not a crime.

35:49.265 --> 35:50.899
We have a strong
relationship.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.351
James respects me.

35:52.402 --> 35:54.987
He would never
do anything--

36:22.932 --> 36:24.066
It went straight
to voice mail.

36:24.133 --> 36:25.517
He must have
turned it off.

36:25.585 --> 36:27.502
Maryann, we need you
to tell us

36:27.570 --> 36:29.921
what you and your
husband used to do
before you got married.

36:29.973 --> 36:31.590
What your habits were.

36:31.641 --> 36:33.559
You mean like where
we went on dates?

36:33.610 --> 36:34.943
No, your sexual habits.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.862
Think of it. You don't
just jump into swinging.

36:36.929 --> 36:38.280
Most people have games
building up to it.

36:38.348 --> 36:39.648
What were they?

36:41.034 --> 36:43.368
He'd sometimes pretend
to pick me up.

36:43.436 --> 36:45.137
What does that mean?

36:45.204 --> 36:47.606
We'd meet at a bar.

36:47.657 --> 36:49.124
I'd arrive
and he wouldn't be there.

36:49.192 --> 36:50.609
He was in the back
watching me.

36:50.660 --> 36:52.611
What were the names
of the bars you went to?

36:52.662 --> 36:55.297
Just one. Dunley's.
It's at the town mall.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.199
And how did the game end?

36:57.267 --> 36:59.217
He'd make me dress
provocatively.

36:59.285 --> 37:00.736
He wanted guys
to hit on me,

37:00.803 --> 37:02.254
and then when
I'd show some interest--

37:02.305 --> 37:05.057
James would step in,
seduce you back to him?

37:20.406 --> 37:22.407
He's in the middle
of the bar.

37:22.475 --> 37:23.442
There's no way
to take him down

37:23.493 --> 37:24.776
without risking
collateral damage.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.328
If we go in there,
he'll start
shooting up the place.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.579
He'll do that anyway.

37:27.647 --> 37:28.947
This guy's looking
for a spark.

37:28.998 --> 37:31.099
Then we'll need
a distraction.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.167
What are you doing?

37:32.251 --> 37:34.169
He's gone back
to his old patterns.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.154
He wants to play the game
he played with his wife.

37:36.205 --> 37:39.124
Debra Wilson played
that game and it got
her killed, Prentiss.

37:39.192 --> 37:40.659
All right, keep his focus
off the crowd

37:40.710 --> 37:42.661
long enough
for us to take him down.

37:42.712 --> 37:44.846
You guys better
have my back.

37:45.848 --> 37:46.932
We will.

Hey! I thought that was you.

37:58.227 --> 38:00.011
How's Maryann?

38:00.063 --> 38:03.982
Oh, you don't
remember me, do you?

38:04.033 --> 38:06.518
We met at a--
a party.

38:06.569 --> 38:08.186
We did?

38:08.237 --> 38:10.489
Yeah. That was a--

38:10.540 --> 38:12.491
that was a crazy night.

38:12.542 --> 38:14.626
I'll bet it was.

38:16.212 --> 38:17.879
Emily.

38:17.964 --> 38:20.165
Um, it was Halloween.

38:20.216 --> 38:22.701
Ok, tell me
if this rings a Bell.

38:22.769 --> 38:26.171
Uh, you asked
if we were interested

38:26.222 --> 38:27.506
in Maryann,

38:27.557 --> 38:30.375
and then you and I
watched for a while,

38:30.426 --> 38:32.227
and then you joined in.

38:32.311 --> 38:34.262
Brian didn't stop
talking about that
for weeks.

38:34.347 --> 38:35.430
Look, look, look, look.

38:35.515 --> 38:38.600
I'm sorry, I really
don't remember you.

38:38.685 --> 38:40.268
It's ok.

38:40.353 --> 38:41.920
So, do you still
hit the scene?

38:41.988 --> 38:44.356
No, I don't.

38:44.407 --> 38:46.942
Hmm.
Yeah, me neither.

38:47.026 --> 38:48.510
I came tonight, uh,

38:48.578 --> 38:51.229
hoping to find
a real man.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.532
Lucky for me
I found you.

38:55.952 --> 38:57.669
So we have met?

38:57.737 --> 39:00.622
So where's Brian?

39:00.707 --> 39:02.424
Oh, he's not around
anymore.

39:02.508 --> 39:05.010
Yeah. Well, that happens.

39:05.078 --> 39:06.862
Lose your boyfriend.

39:06.929 --> 39:09.464
The scene will
definitely do that.

39:09.549 --> 39:10.932
You know, I'm not
that torn up about it.

39:11.017 --> 39:13.852
There'll be other
boyfriends.

39:13.919 --> 39:14.970
Hmm.

39:15.054 --> 39:17.055
You know, there's only, uh,

39:17.106 --> 39:20.609
only one way to make
the lifestyle really work.

39:20.693 --> 39:24.596
You gotta choose someone
who's stable.

39:24.647 --> 39:27.983
Who's, uh, secure.

39:28.067 --> 39:30.652
In fact, Maryann and I
have a, uh,

39:30.737 --> 39:32.070
little secret system
we worked out.

39:32.121 --> 39:33.455
You want to know
what that is?

39:33.539 --> 39:39.060
I always choose
husbands for her...

39:39.128 --> 39:40.712
Never boyfriends.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.300
I don't know you.

39:45.384 --> 39:48.220
And you don't know me.

39:48.287 --> 39:50.856
Move, move.

40:06.105 --> 40:07.939
FBI! Nobody move!

40:07.990 --> 40:11.943
The situation is under control.
You're not in danger.

40:11.994 --> 40:14.079
You need help?

40:16.065 --> 40:17.015
Are you all right?

40:17.083 --> 40:21.670
Tell...Tell...Tell Maryann...

40:21.754 --> 40:24.823
Tell Maryann...

40:24.891 --> 40:26.341
I will.

40:39.972 --> 40:41.840
"We all wear masks,
and the time comes

40:41.891 --> 40:45.560
when we cannot remove them
without removing our own skin."

40:45.645 --> 40:47.395
Andre berthiaume.

40:51.868 --> 40:53.685
Garcia...

40:53.736 --> 40:55.687
Sir, I'm scanning
the open case files.

40:55.738 --> 40:58.356
My plan is to have
this office paperless
in a month.

40:58.407 --> 41:00.075
That can wait.

41:00.159 --> 41:02.377
When gideon left the bau,

41:02.461 --> 41:05.597
I found myself taking on
too much responsibility.

41:05.665 --> 41:09.634
And I quickly realized
that I could only do the job
that I was good at.

41:09.702 --> 41:12.037
I've seen you give everything
to this case and to this team

41:12.104 --> 41:13.255
for the last few days,

41:13.339 --> 41:16.057
but the truth is,
we need you here.

41:16.142 --> 41:18.042
Oh, thank God.

41:18.094 --> 41:21.596
Sir, I do not want
that job. I mean--

41:21.681 --> 41:23.214
I want part of the job.

41:23.266 --> 41:24.900
I want the part
that keeps me here,

41:24.984 --> 41:26.384
'cause here I'm Mozart,

41:26.435 --> 41:30.689
but out there,
I was like a monkey
playing the trumpet,

41:30.740 --> 41:32.524
and you guys need Mozart.

41:32.575 --> 41:34.726
You did fine.

41:34.777 --> 41:36.995
What if we split up the job?

41:37.062 --> 41:39.748
You can handle intake
and resources here at Quantico,

41:39.832 --> 41:41.333
we can cover the rest
in the field,

41:41.400 --> 41:43.268
and when we need you,
you'll still travel with us.

41:43.336 --> 41:44.669
You can do that?

41:44.737 --> 41:47.005
Of course.

41:47.073 --> 41:49.073
But I let you down.

41:49.125 --> 41:52.160
In no way whatsoever.

41:52.228 --> 41:56.181
I kind of lost
my marbles out there.

41:56.248 --> 41:58.216
Garcia, when you applied
for this job,

41:58.267 --> 42:01.853
you gave me your resume
on homemade pink stationery.

42:01.921 --> 42:06.508
I realized then
that you were...Unique.

42:06.576 --> 42:09.694
And I wouldn't want you
to change that.

42:09.762 --> 42:10.996
Good night.

42:11.063 --> 42:13.198
Good night.
