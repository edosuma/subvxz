02:36.409 --> 02:38.242
Whoa...

02:55.075 --> 02:57.950
Hey, thanks for
stopping.

02:57.950 --> 02:59.200
Where you headed?

02:59.200 --> 03:00.866
Wherever you are.

03:00.866 --> 03:02.283
Hop in.

03:25.117 --> 03:26.492
My name's Josh.

03:26.492 --> 03:28.075
I'm Breezy.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.492
Thanks again for picking me up.

03:30.492 --> 03:32.075
It's awfully
nice of you.

03:32.075 --> 03:33.825
No problem.
No problem at all.

03:33.825 --> 03:35.409
You a student?

03:35.409 --> 03:36.659
A student?

03:36.659 --> 03:39.409
State University.
That's where I'm headed.

03:39.409 --> 03:41.908
That's an awfully nice ring.

03:41.908 --> 03:43.908
You like it? Solid gold.

03:43.908 --> 03:45.534
Gotta represent, right?

03:45.534 --> 03:46.741
So,

03:46.741 --> 03:48.492
you headed
there too?

03:48.492 --> 03:50.450
Fall semester
starts in a week.

03:50.450 --> 03:51.991
Oh, I see.

03:51.991 --> 03:54.450
Um, no, I'm not a student.

03:54.450 --> 03:57.200
I'm just... travelling.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.534
Free spirit, huh?

03:58.534 --> 04:00.575
That's right.

04:00.575 --> 04:02.492
I like that.

04:02.492 --> 04:05.409
Do you play football, Josh?

04:05.409 --> 04:08.325
Yeah, I do.
How'd you guess?

04:08.325 --> 04:10.866
Well, you look like you're

04:10.866 --> 04:12.325
in really
good shape.

04:12.325 --> 04:14.492
Yeah, the team hits the weight
room twice a week.

04:14.492 --> 04:18.242
Do you always pick up
hitchhikers, Josh?

04:18.242 --> 04:20.866
Uh, no.

04:20.866 --> 04:22.200
Not really.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.200
I mean, never, before today.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.117
Well...

04:29.117 --> 04:31.617
then I guess
today's your lucky day.

04:31.617 --> 04:33.991
I guess it is.

04:33.991 --> 04:36.700
Pull up over there.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.700
Oh, uh... yeah.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.617
Buckle up, Josh.

04:53.617 --> 04:55.741
It's gonna be a bumpy ride.

11:43.534 --> 11:45.866
All right, I'm off to work.

11:45.866 --> 11:47.950
I'll be pulling
a double shift tonight,

11:47.950 --> 11:49.409
so I'll be home late.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.866
Try to miss me.

11:50.866 --> 11:52.158
Honey...

11:52.158 --> 11:53.492
I'm sorry.

11:53.492 --> 11:55.450
Sorry about what?

11:55.450 --> 11:57.242
Sorry you have to
work so hard.

11:57.242 --> 11:59.200
Maybe I should
just give all this up.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.242
Brian, don't be ridiculous.
We agreed.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.991
I'll work
while you go to school.

12:02.991 --> 12:05.659
Once you have your engineering degree,
we'll be set.

12:05.659 --> 12:07.991
Yeah, and in the meantime,
my wife is schlepping booze

12:07.991 --> 12:09.659
to drunks
on a nightly basis.

12:09.659 --> 12:12.242
It's only for a little while,
and the tips are pretty good.

12:12.242 --> 12:14.492
Any response to our ad?

12:14.492 --> 12:16.991
It only came out yesterday.
Give it some time.

12:16.991 --> 12:19.283
The extra room is
just sitting empty up there.

12:19.283 --> 12:21.158
We can get somebody to rent it,

12:21.158 --> 12:23.033
you won't have to work
these double shifts.

12:23.033 --> 12:25.158
I won't lie.
I wouldn't mind that.

12:27.617 --> 12:29.409
Speak of the devil?

12:29.409 --> 12:31.325
Do you think?

12:31.325 --> 12:34.075
Who else?

12:35.866 --> 12:37.283
Can I help you?

12:37.283 --> 12:38.783
Hi.

12:38.783 --> 12:40.783
Are you the one that placed
the ad about the spare room?

12:40.783 --> 12:43.075
We are.

12:43.075 --> 12:45.200
Well, I'm interested,
if it's still available.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.575
Of course, come on in.

12:51.283 --> 12:53.325
Please, have a seat.

12:53.325 --> 12:55.991
We'd like to ask you some questions,
if that's okay?

12:55.991 --> 12:57.075
Sure.

12:57.075 --> 12:58.783
- My wife's gotta go to work, but...
- I have time.

12:58.783 --> 13:01.450
So, you are?

13:01.450 --> 13:03.325
Breezy, Breezy Johnson.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.575
Breezy.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.575
I'm Traci, and this is
my husband Brian.

13:06.575 --> 13:07.908
Nice to meet you both.

13:07.908 --> 13:09.409
So, what do you do
for a living, Breezy?

13:09.409 --> 13:11.950
I'm a student
at State University.

13:11.950 --> 13:14.242
We're an awfully long way
from the university.

13:14.242 --> 13:16.783
Oh, I know,
but I registered late,

13:16.783 --> 13:19.950
so all the housing was taken,
and I can't afford anything

13:19.950 --> 13:21.158
closer to campus.

13:21.158 --> 13:22.534
How will you get to school?

13:22.534 --> 13:24.409
I have a friend
whose parents live nearby.

13:24.409 --> 13:26.991
He's gonna pick me up
and we'll car pool.

13:26.991 --> 13:28.825
You know the room's 500 a month.

13:28.825 --> 13:30.450
Right.

13:30.450 --> 13:32.741
We'll require first and last
month's rent ahead of time.

13:32.741 --> 13:34.075
That's fine.

13:34.075 --> 13:36.741
Well, would you like
to see the room?

13:36.741 --> 13:37.991
Sure.

13:43.908 --> 13:46.283
Here it is.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.283
You have your own bathroom,

13:48.283 --> 13:51.158
and there's an exit off the back hallway,
so you have complete privacy.

13:51.158 --> 13:52.950
This is really nice.

13:52.950 --> 13:56.033
No parties,
and no overnight guests.

13:56.033 --> 13:58.075
Oh, you don't have to
worry about that.

13:58.075 --> 14:00.659
You'll hardly even
know I'm here.

14:01.950 --> 14:04.825
So, is it settled then?

14:04.825 --> 14:06.450
Sure.

14:06.450 --> 14:07.659
Great.

14:07.659 --> 14:09.325
So, your keys are here
on the dresser.

14:09.325 --> 14:11.450
Do you have any bags
you need help bringing up?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.325
No, I'm good, thanks.

14:13.325 --> 14:15.367
Okay, welcome.

14:46.659 --> 14:49.075
Holy shit!

14:52.741 --> 14:54.741
Sheriff Bates,

14:54.741 --> 14:57.325
this is Deputy Randall.

14:57.325 --> 14:59.700
I'm out on Route 30.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.741
Found a car
on the side of the road.

15:02.741 --> 15:04.659
There's a dead body in it.

15:13.741 --> 15:15.825
Where the hell's that paper?

15:29.700 --> 15:31.534
Hello?

19:42.700 --> 19:44.617
Welcome home, honey.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.200
Hey.

19:48.908 --> 19:51.950
Maybe I should work
a double shift more often.

19:51.950 --> 19:54.534
Have I told you lately
how much I love you?

19:54.534 --> 19:57.783
You have, but
you can never say it enough.

19:58.950 --> 20:01.617
I really appreciate
everything you do.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.700
What's gotten
into you?

20:03.700 --> 20:07.783
Nothing... can't a man show
a little affection for his wife?

20:07.783 --> 20:09.617
Of course.

20:14.325 --> 20:16.158
Is our house
guest home?

20:16.158 --> 20:18.033
Hmm? Oh, no.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.158
I think she left
early this morning.

20:20.158 --> 20:22.409
Probably had a class.

20:22.409 --> 20:24.033
Good.

20:38.075 --> 20:40.158
What's gotten into you, babe?

20:40.158 --> 20:42.158
Ah, I missed you.

27:48.367 --> 27:52.617
Sheriff, I got the autopsy report
on that John Doe.

27:52.617 --> 27:54.409
Well, he's not

27:54.409 --> 27:56.117
a John Doe anymore.

27:56.117 --> 27:59.950
Vehicle registration came back
to a Clark, Josh Clark.

27:59.950 --> 28:01.783
We're checking him out
right now.

28:01.783 --> 28:04.409
So, did you find anything
interesting in this?

28:04.409 --> 28:05.575
Poisoned.

28:05.575 --> 28:07.409
- Poisoned?!
- Mm-hmm.

28:07.409 --> 28:10.158
Fast acting one, too,
according to the medical examiner.

28:12.283 --> 28:16.492
Says they found a little pin
prick on his neck.

28:16.492 --> 28:18.450
So, what you think, Sheriff?

28:18.450 --> 28:20.242
Hitchhiker?

28:20.242 --> 28:24.409
Could be, but where'd they go?

28:24.409 --> 28:27.283
Maybe he got picked up
by another car.

28:27.283 --> 28:29.950
Yeah, it's possible.

28:29.950 --> 28:33.367
See if you can dig up

28:33.367 --> 28:35.367
that bulletin
we got a while back

28:35.367 --> 28:38.158
on those unsolved murders
out in Nevada.

28:38.158 --> 28:40.991
Yeah, hold on.

28:46.825 --> 28:50.325
I believe that was
a hitchhiker then, too.

28:51.866 --> 28:54.283
That's right. Here it is.

28:54.283 --> 28:57.158
Poisoned, if my memory serves.

29:01.534 --> 29:04.950
Yeah, there wasn't much
to go on here.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.200
Same M.O.

29:06.200 --> 29:08.450
Poison.

29:08.450 --> 29:11.700
And, they found a small pin
prick on his neck.

29:13.200 --> 29:16.617
So, we didn't get
any usable finger prints.

29:16.617 --> 29:19.866
But the lab boys,
they swabbed the wound on our vic,

29:19.866 --> 29:22.033
and if they come up
with any foreign DNA,

29:22.033 --> 29:24.117
they said they'd
let us know right away.

29:24.117 --> 29:25.783
I got a friend that works over
in the state lab.

29:25.783 --> 29:27.450
I'll give them a call,
tell them to put a rush on it.

29:27.450 --> 29:28.866
Good.

29:28.866 --> 29:30.450
And after that, I want you

29:30.450 --> 29:32.908
to go back up there and
canvass the neighborhood

29:32.908 --> 29:34.367
in that canyon.

29:34.367 --> 29:36.617
If we had a hitchhiker
going through there,

29:36.617 --> 29:39.617
I'll bet you somebody
saw something somewhere.

29:39.617 --> 29:41.409
Right, there's
not many homes up there.

29:41.409 --> 29:42.741
I'll do it this afternoon.

29:42.741 --> 29:44.367
Good.

30:37.283 --> 30:38.659
Hi.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.617
Hey.

30:41.617 --> 30:43.575
How are you?

30:43.575 --> 30:46.575
Good. Find anything?

30:46.575 --> 30:50.283
Nah. Hasn't been my lucky day.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.991
Well, your luck
might be changing.

30:51.991 --> 30:53.450
I'm Breezy.

30:53.450 --> 30:56.450
Breezy?

30:56.450 --> 30:58.117
That's an interesting name.

30:58.117 --> 30:59.367
Thanks.

30:59.367 --> 31:01.450
I'm Rick.

31:01.450 --> 31:02.741
Nice to meet you.

31:02.741 --> 31:03.950
Same here.

31:03.950 --> 31:07.117
So, what are you
doing today, Breezy?

31:07.117 --> 31:09.200
Just bumming around the beach?

31:09.200 --> 31:11.575
Something like that.

31:11.575 --> 31:14.450
I just love the ocean, you know.

31:14.450 --> 31:16.908
The way it crashes on the shore,

31:16.908 --> 31:19.534
over and over again.

31:19.534 --> 31:23.534
Yes... it's almost erotic.

31:23.534 --> 31:26.242
I'm so glad you understand.

31:29.575 --> 31:31.908
Hold on.

31:31.908 --> 31:33.659
Listen, I got a van up there.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.492
Let's go take
some shelter, huh?

36:08.741 --> 36:10.492
That's it?

36:10.492 --> 36:12.492
Well, what did you expect, baby?

36:12.492 --> 36:14.367
You pick up a guy at the beach.

36:14.367 --> 36:16.741
There's not exactly
gonna be flowers and candy.

36:16.741 --> 36:18.908
You know what I mean?

36:18.908 --> 36:21.991
I know exactly what you mean...

36:21.991 --> 36:23.617
baby.

36:37.283 --> 36:39.325
Can I help you, Deputy?

36:39.325 --> 36:41.450
Just need to ask you
a few questions.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.783
Can I come in?

36:42.783 --> 36:45.200
Yeah, of course.

36:52.158 --> 36:53.783
What's going on?

36:53.783 --> 36:55.325
Don't know.

36:55.325 --> 36:56.700
Nothing to be
concerned about, ma'am.

36:56.700 --> 36:58.367
I'm just talking
to all the neighbors.

36:58.367 --> 37:00.033
Wanted to make sure
they haven't seen any strangers

37:00.033 --> 37:01.700
the last few days,
anything unusual?

37:01.700 --> 37:02.991
No, nothing.

37:02.991 --> 37:04.200
There is Breezy.

37:04.200 --> 37:06.033
- Breezy?
- She's our new tenant.

37:06.033 --> 37:07.283
She just moved in yesterday.

37:07.283 --> 37:10.075
- Is she here now?
- No, she's out.

37:10.075 --> 37:12.325
Okay, I would like to speak to her as soon as
I can. Do you know how to contact her?

37:12.325 --> 37:14.450
No, I don't.
Listen, what's this about?

37:14.450 --> 37:17.825
There was a murder
on Route 30 yesterday.

37:17.825 --> 37:19.492
- What? A murder!
- Oh, my God.

37:19.492 --> 37:21.075
We think it was
a hitchhiker.

37:21.075 --> 37:23.075
Most likely, long since gone,

37:23.075 --> 37:25.325
but we just want to be thorough.

37:31.242 --> 37:32.866
Hello.

37:32.866 --> 37:34.367
Hi, you must be Breezy.

37:34.367 --> 37:36.283
That's right.

37:36.283 --> 37:37.575
I'm Deputy Randall.

37:37.575 --> 37:38.700
Hi.

37:38.700 --> 37:40.534
He's here asking
about a murder.

37:40.534 --> 37:43.950
Well, that's not exactly accurate,
but I would like to speak with you.

37:43.950 --> 37:45.409
Okay.

37:45.409 --> 37:47.492
Where were you yesterday,
before you came here?

37:47.492 --> 37:48.908
Ma'am, if you don't mind,

37:48.908 --> 37:50.866
I'd like to do the questioning.

37:50.866 --> 37:52.741
I would like
to speak to her alone.

37:52.741 --> 37:55.033
Of course. Traci.

37:55.033 --> 37:57.617
Would you like
to take a seat?

37:57.617 --> 37:59.617
Okay.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.908
Your full name.

38:05.908 --> 38:07.534
Breezy Johnson.

38:07.534 --> 38:09.158
Breezy?

38:09.158 --> 38:11.117
What can I say?

38:11.117 --> 38:12.617
My parents were hippies.

38:12.617 --> 38:16.283
I'm told you arrived
here yesterday.

38:16.283 --> 38:18.158
That's right.

38:18.158 --> 38:19.991
From where?

38:19.991 --> 38:21.325
Portland.

38:21.325 --> 38:22.659
Portland.

38:22.659 --> 38:24.117
And how did you get here?

38:24.117 --> 38:25.950
I took the bus.

38:25.950 --> 38:28.950
The nearest bus stop's
in Blairesville.

38:28.950 --> 38:32.492
Right, I had a friend
pick me up.

38:32.492 --> 38:33.950
He drove me here.

38:33.950 --> 38:37.492
And you're going to State.

38:37.492 --> 38:39.659
Yes, or, I will be.

38:39.659 --> 38:41.908
I haven't registered yet.

38:41.908 --> 38:45.450
And your friend's name.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.200
Joe.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.825
Joe what?

38:48.825 --> 38:50.242
Oh, gosh,

38:50.242 --> 38:52.367
you know, I actually
don't know his last name.

38:52.367 --> 38:55.825
He's really a friend of my brother's,
go to the same school,

38:55.825 --> 38:58.325
so he offered to pick me up.

38:58.325 --> 38:59.950
I saw the ad

38:59.950 --> 39:01.450
for the room here

39:01.450 --> 39:02.950
and I had him drop me off here.

39:02.950 --> 39:06.866
I think I have
enough information for now.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.866
Great.

39:10.950 --> 39:14.283
Well, if you need to talk again,

39:14.283 --> 39:15.783
you know where to find me.

39:15.783 --> 39:17.950
Well, if you see anything
or anyone suspicious,

39:17.950 --> 39:19.617
you give me a call.

39:19.617 --> 39:21.991
My number's on the back.

39:21.991 --> 39:24.075
You call me day or night.

39:24.075 --> 39:25.575
Thanks, Deputy.

39:25.575 --> 39:28.117
You can call me Jeremy.

39:28.117 --> 39:30.283
Jeremy.

39:30.283 --> 39:31.950
I'll do that.

40:08.075 --> 40:09.991
So, the cops were at your place?

40:09.991 --> 40:12.617
Yeah, some kid apparently
got killed a few days ago,

40:12.617 --> 40:14.409
left his car
on the side of the road.

40:14.409 --> 40:16.158
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I heard about that.

40:16.158 --> 40:18.283
Yeah, I guess you never know
when you're gonna buy it.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.492
But, Charlie,
the same day that happens,

40:20.492 --> 40:22.534
this woman, Breezy,
shows up at our house.

40:22.534 --> 40:24.033
You're telling me
that's a coincidence.

40:24.033 --> 40:25.283
This is your new tenant?

40:25.283 --> 40:26.991
Yeah, and frankly, something

40:26.991 --> 40:29.617
seemed off about her,
right from the beginning.

40:29.617 --> 40:31.075
So why did you rent to her?

40:31.075 --> 40:32.325
We need the money.

40:32.325 --> 40:33.741
Brian's going to school,

40:33.741 --> 40:35.575
and we can't live off
what I make in this dump.

40:35.575 --> 40:36.866
Hey!

40:36.866 --> 40:38.367
No offence.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.242
Well, did you do a background check,
did you check her credit?

40:40.242 --> 40:42.367
No, she's just a college kid.
Paid in cash.

40:42.367 --> 40:43.991
Well, it's none of my business,

40:43.991 --> 40:46.033
but if I have
a potential murderer

40:46.033 --> 40:47.450
living under my roof...

40:47.450 --> 40:48.950
I'm not sure I'd go that far.

40:48.950 --> 40:50.617
I mean, she talked to the cops
and they let her go.

40:50.617 --> 40:53.117
Still, I mean, if it were me,
I'd look into it.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.741
Well, what can I do?

40:54.741 --> 40:56.825
I can't exactly kick her out
without a reason.

40:56.825 --> 40:58.033
I'm not saying kick her out,

40:58.033 --> 40:59.450
I'm saying,
learn more about her.

40:59.450 --> 41:00.617
How?

41:00.617 --> 41:02.033
Well, she's not
always home, right?

41:02.033 --> 41:04.158
She goes out.
Next time she does.

41:04.158 --> 41:06.075
Sneak in her room,
look through her shit.

41:06.075 --> 41:08.575
Really?
That doesn't seem right.

41:08.575 --> 41:10.200
What's right got
to do with it?

41:10.200 --> 41:11.450
She's living in your home.

41:11.450 --> 41:12.908
You got a dead body
down the street.

41:12.908 --> 41:14.325
The cops are knocking
at your door.

41:14.325 --> 41:15.825
I think you're way past

41:15.825 --> 41:17.283
right and wrong here.

41:17.283 --> 41:19.575
Trust me,
you'll sleep better.

41:19.575 --> 41:22.825
Maybe you're right.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.075
Okay, thanks.

41:28.075 --> 41:31.741
You know, I really appreciate
you guys getting right on this.

41:31.741 --> 41:33.741
Yeah, thanks.

41:35.367 --> 41:37.783
I got some background
on our vic.

41:37.783 --> 41:39.242
Josh Clark.

41:39.242 --> 41:41.075
Registered as
a student at State University.

41:41.075 --> 41:42.450
Well, that makes sense.

41:42.450 --> 41:44.450
I think the fall semester
starts up this week.

41:44.450 --> 41:45.866
Right.

41:45.866 --> 41:47.991
Well, that was your pal over
at the lab on the phone.

41:47.991 --> 41:52.158
They got some DNA off
the wound which is not Clark's.

41:52.158 --> 41:53.991
So that's got to be our killer.

41:53.991 --> 41:56.367
I got them checking all
the national data bases

41:56.367 --> 41:58.659
and we ought to have
an answer by morning.

41:58.659 --> 42:00.825
Well, even if he's not
in the system,

42:00.825 --> 42:02.242
we come up
with a suspect,

42:02.242 --> 42:03.617
we'll have something
to match it with.

42:03.617 --> 42:05.409
Right, now how did
your door to door go?

42:05.409 --> 42:07.950
Spent most of yesterday
canvassing the neighborhood

42:07.950 --> 42:09.825
going up and down the canyon.

42:09.825 --> 42:11.283
20 homes total.

42:11.283 --> 42:13.033
Anything?

42:13.033 --> 42:16.575
Well, nothing to be
suspicious about really.

42:16.575 --> 42:18.075
Pretty much a dead end.

42:18.075 --> 42:19.783
Ah, that's okay.

42:19.783 --> 42:21.991
It was a long shot anyway.

42:24.991 --> 42:28.367
Sheriff's station.
Deputy Randall speaking.

42:28.367 --> 42:30.033
Wait, what?

42:30.033 --> 42:32.409
Where?

42:32.409 --> 42:33.866
Where exactly?

42:33.866 --> 42:36.617
Okay, don't touch a thing.
We'll be right there.

42:36.617 --> 42:39.325
I mean it.
Don't touch a thing.

42:39.325 --> 42:41.117
What's up?

42:41.117 --> 42:43.492
They just found
a dead body on the beach.

42:43.492 --> 42:45.492
Drowned?

42:45.492 --> 42:46.866
No.

42:46.866 --> 42:48.866
Looks like it could be
the work of our hitchhiker.

42:48.866 --> 42:51.158
Damn!

42:53.033 --> 42:55.659
Hello?

42:55.659 --> 42:58.492
Is anyone home?

42:58.492 --> 43:00.908
Come on in.

43:00.908 --> 43:02.325
You sure it's okay.

43:02.325 --> 43:04.991
Yeah, no one's home.

43:10.575 --> 43:12.367
You know,
I don't normally do this.

43:12.367 --> 43:15.283
You know, go home with someone
I just met at a bar.

43:15.283 --> 43:17.242
Shut up and take off
your clothes.

43:17.242 --> 43:19.825
No, no, not here.
Let's go to your room.

43:19.825 --> 43:21.242
Okay.

49:38.908 --> 49:40.908
Ahh!

50:06.908 --> 50:08.950
Same wound, all right.

50:08.950 --> 50:11.075
That's definitely
our second victim.

50:11.075 --> 50:14.617
Looks like we got
a serial killer in our small town.

50:14.617 --> 50:16.741
Sure looks that way.

50:16.741 --> 50:19.450
Looks like the body's
been here all night.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.325
Medical examiner's on the way.

50:21.325 --> 50:24.283
He should be able to
confirm the time of death.

50:24.283 --> 50:26.741
These marks in the sand.

50:26.741 --> 50:28.492
Looks like he fell
from up there.

50:28.492 --> 50:30.117
I'll go and check out that van.

50:30.117 --> 50:32.117
You stay here
and wait for the M.E.

50:32.117 --> 50:34.075
Right.

50:37.117 --> 50:38.950
Deputy Randall.

50:38.950 --> 50:40.741
"Deputy Randall."

50:40.741 --> 50:42.783
That sounds so official.

50:42.783 --> 50:44.242
Hello, Breezy.

50:44.242 --> 50:46.200
What can I do you for?

50:46.200 --> 50:49.325
Well, I was wondering if
I could see you tonight.

50:49.325 --> 50:53.117
Uh... you have some
information for me?

50:53.117 --> 50:54.991
Well, if that means that you'll

50:54.991 --> 50:56.991
go out with me tonight,
then sure.

50:56.991 --> 50:59.575
Uh, I'm on duty tonight.

50:59.575 --> 51:03.200
Oh, so, do I have to commit
a crime or something to see you?

51:03.200 --> 51:05.617
No, I certainly wouldn't
want you to do that.

51:05.617 --> 51:09.409
You don't have to stay in
the office the whole night, do you?

51:09.409 --> 51:11.825
No, no, the calls are being
forwarded to my cell.

51:11.825 --> 51:13.741
I'm on patrol tonight.

51:13.741 --> 51:16.367
It's a small town,
but we do have a...

51:16.367 --> 51:18.659
we do have a crime to deal with.

51:18.659 --> 51:21.242
Well, on these patrols,
do you ever happen

51:21.242 --> 51:23.617
to patrol near Charlie's Bar?

51:23.617 --> 51:26.117
Yeah, that's on my route.

51:26.117 --> 51:28.075
And is there any chance
that you would be

51:28.075 --> 51:30.200
patrolling there
around 9:00 p.m. tonight?

51:30.200 --> 51:32.866
I very well could be.

51:32.866 --> 51:36.367
Fine. I'll see you then.

51:56.033 --> 51:57.367
Hi.

51:57.367 --> 51:58.950
Hey, what can I get you?

51:58.950 --> 52:00.492
I'll just have a beer, thanks.

52:00.492 --> 52:01.825
Cool, coming right up.

52:01.825 --> 52:03.367
Need another round
for table three.

52:03.367 --> 52:04.534
Breezy?

52:04.534 --> 52:05.908
What are you doing here?

52:05.908 --> 52:07.325
Traci, you work here?

52:07.325 --> 52:08.534
I do.

52:08.534 --> 52:09.950
I just came in for a drink.

52:09.950 --> 52:11.325
Okay.

52:11.325 --> 52:13.659
Somehow, I feel like

52:13.659 --> 52:15.575
we got off on the wrong foot.

52:15.575 --> 52:17.409
You don't seem
to like me very much.

52:17.409 --> 52:19.534
I'd love it
if we could be friends.

52:19.534 --> 52:21.242
I don't know you very well.

52:21.242 --> 52:22.866
We should change that.

52:22.866 --> 52:24.075
We should.

52:24.075 --> 52:25.283
Let's get together later

52:25.283 --> 52:26.950
and have a girl's chat,
shall we?

52:26.950 --> 52:28.409
I would like that very much.

52:28.409 --> 52:30.534
- All right, can't wait.
- There you go.

52:30.534 --> 52:32.033
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

52:32.033 --> 52:34.158
Hey, that table's had enough, okay.
They're cut off.

52:34.158 --> 52:35.575
Right, thanks.

52:35.575 --> 52:37.033
Talk to you later.

52:37.033 --> 52:38.825
Great.

52:38.825 --> 52:41.534
Well, hello, Deputy.

52:41.534 --> 52:43.367
What a surprise to see you here.

52:43.367 --> 52:46.075
Yeah, well, my patrol
just happened to pass by,

52:46.075 --> 52:48.033
and I thought
maybe I'd come in

52:48.033 --> 52:50.325
and see if any devious activity
was going on.

52:50.325 --> 52:52.117
I swear, officer, I'm innocent.

52:52.117 --> 52:53.783
Pa-kow!

52:53.783 --> 52:55.575
Hey, Deputy,
what can I get you?

52:55.575 --> 52:58.783
Hey, Charlie.
Uh, soda. I'm on duty.

52:58.783 --> 53:00.492
- Thanks for coming out.
- Yeah, no problem.

53:00.492 --> 53:02.700
We can do this again
when I'm not in duty

53:02.700 --> 53:04.783
and I can have more
than just a soda.

53:04.783 --> 53:07.117
I'll look forward to it.

53:07.117 --> 53:10.283
So, tell me about yourself, Jeremy.

53:10.283 --> 53:14.991
Uh, well,
not much to tell, really.

53:14.991 --> 53:17.534
Well, are you from around here?

53:17.534 --> 53:20.450
Yeah, I grew up in a town
about 50 miles west of here.

53:20.450 --> 53:22.325
My uncle was the sheriff.

53:22.325 --> 53:24.492
So, when I became a cop,
I looked for a job nearby,

53:24.492 --> 53:26.741
and this is the first place
that would hire me.

53:26.741 --> 53:28.741
You must be terribly exciting.

53:28.741 --> 53:31.617
Uh, I'm a small town cop, really.

53:31.617 --> 53:34.908
I just deal with stray cats
and write parking tickets,

53:34.908 --> 53:36.950
well, until recently.

53:36.950 --> 53:38.991
Oh, right, the murder.

53:38.991 --> 53:41.950
Did you ever find the person
you were looking for?

53:41.950 --> 53:43.700
The one that killed that boy.

53:43.700 --> 53:46.075
No, not yet,
but we're making progress.

53:46.075 --> 53:47.325
However...

53:47.325 --> 53:48.741
However?

53:48.741 --> 53:51.325
We found a body this morning.

53:51.325 --> 53:52.741
Oh, no.

53:52.741 --> 53:54.033
Yeah, same killer.

53:54.033 --> 53:57.200
That's horrible.
Do you have any leads?

53:57.200 --> 53:58.825
We have a DNA sample.

53:58.825 --> 54:01.825
If we get a hit on that,

54:01.825 --> 54:03.492
we might find our man.

54:03.492 --> 54:06.575
Well, that sounds promising.

54:06.575 --> 54:08.991
Yeah, but it's a bit
of a long shot.

54:08.991 --> 54:10.908
It's not like it is
in the movies.

54:10.908 --> 54:12.866
You know, if the person
hasn't done a crime

54:12.866 --> 54:15.242
or served active military,
they probably won't

54:15.242 --> 54:17.492
be in the system,
but it's a start though.

54:17.492 --> 54:19.950
Listen, Charlie,
I'm taking off early.

54:19.950 --> 54:21.741
What? You're here till 2:00.

54:21.741 --> 54:23.409
No, that's my tenant
over there.

54:23.409 --> 54:24.783
And as long
as she's here,

54:24.783 --> 54:26.450
that means that
she's not at home.

54:26.450 --> 54:27.783
I'm about to
take your advice.

54:27.783 --> 54:29.367
I should learn
to keep my mouth shut.

54:29.367 --> 54:31.991
I didn't know it was gonna cost me
my best waitress tonight.

54:31.991 --> 54:35.659
I'll see you later.
Thank you.

54:35.659 --> 54:39.575
Listen, I got to get going. I got to stop
by the station and get back on patrol.

54:39.575 --> 54:41.700
Well, you know,

54:41.700 --> 54:44.866
I've never seen the inside
of a police station before.

54:44.866 --> 54:47.825
Ah, it's nothing terribly exciting.

54:47.825 --> 54:50.617
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

54:54.033 --> 54:55.825
Let's go.

55:05.200 --> 55:07.200
Well, this is it.

55:07.200 --> 55:09.033
Not much to it, really.

55:09.033 --> 55:11.075
I think it looks real nice.

55:11.075 --> 55:12.575
Is this your desk?

55:12.575 --> 55:13.866
Uh...

55:13.866 --> 55:15.783
Yeah.

55:15.783 --> 55:17.908
You want a cup of coffee?

55:17.908 --> 55:19.908
Sure.

55:27.700 --> 55:30.908
What are these?
Top secret police documents?

55:30.908 --> 55:33.033
Nah, those are the DNA results

55:33.033 --> 55:35.617
from that kid we found
in the car the other day.

55:35.617 --> 55:37.825
So scientific.

55:37.825 --> 55:40.991
Well, forensics are the way
to solve crimes these days.

55:42.950 --> 55:45.617
Oh, my gosh.
I'm so sorry.

55:45.617 --> 55:47.283
No, it's, it's okay.

55:47.283 --> 55:50.117
It's not your fault.

55:50.117 --> 55:51.783
I hope I didn't ruin anything.

55:51.783 --> 55:54.950
No, no, these are just copies
of the report from the lab.

55:54.950 --> 55:57.450
Oh, good.

56:04.783 --> 56:06.450
Breezy...

01:01:55.242 --> 01:01:57.325
Oh, yeah, please!

01:01:57.325 --> 01:01:59.866
Oh, God!

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:12.033
Randall! Randall, you here?

01:02:12.033 --> 01:02:13.825
Oh, shit, it's the sheriff.

01:02:13.825 --> 01:02:15.700
Come on, put on your clothes.

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.659
Go out the back door.

01:02:18.825 --> 01:02:20.617
Randall!

01:02:20.617 --> 01:02:22.783
Damn kid!

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.325
This is Sheriff Bates.

01:02:28.325 --> 01:02:30.325
Oh, hey, Hector.
How you doing?

01:02:30.325 --> 01:02:32.409
You lab boys find out anything?

01:02:32.409 --> 01:02:33.700
We did.

01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:35.075
We just got a positive hit

01:02:35.075 --> 01:02:36.492
on that DNA sample
you sent us.

01:02:36.492 --> 01:02:38.409
I'm emailing you
the details now.

01:02:38.409 --> 01:02:40.783
Well, how about just
giving me the short version?

01:02:40.783 --> 01:02:42.283
It's a woman.

01:02:42.283 --> 01:02:43.783
Her name's
Brenda Johnson.

01:02:43.783 --> 01:02:45.617
Arrested a few times
back in Michigan for

01:02:45.617 --> 01:02:47.450
petty theft, simple assault,
nothing major.

01:02:47.450 --> 01:02:50.617
Well, sounds like she's hitting
the big time now.

01:02:50.617 --> 01:02:51.950
And check this out.

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:53.659
She worked
for two years

01:02:53.659 --> 01:02:55.575
at her father's
chemical processing plant

01:02:55.575 --> 01:02:57.200
that manufactured rat poison.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.534
Well, that sounds like
that's our girl.

01:02:59.534 --> 01:03:01.700
Okay, I'm gonna
send you the details.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:03.783
Okay, I'd appreciate it.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:50.158
Sarah...

01:03:53.158 --> 01:03:54.991
Josh?

01:03:57.783 --> 01:03:59.659
What the hell
are you doing in here?!

01:03:59.659 --> 01:04:02.117
Um, I was,
I was looking for you.

01:04:02.117 --> 01:04:03.783
Stay out of my stuff!

01:04:03.783 --> 01:04:05.659
Oh, gosh. I'm sorry.

01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:07.409
I didn't mean to pry,
but listen.

01:04:07.409 --> 01:04:10.325
I don't think this is working out.
You need to move.

01:04:10.325 --> 01:04:12.200
- What?
- You can stay here tonight.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:15.158
But I need you out of here
by tomorrow afternoon.

01:04:17.409 --> 01:04:19.534
But...

01:04:19.534 --> 01:04:23.283
I thought, I thought we were
finally getting to know one another.

01:04:23.283 --> 01:04:25.783
I don't know a thing about you.

01:04:25.783 --> 01:04:28.283
I'd love to share.

01:04:28.283 --> 01:04:31.783
You're so beautiful.

01:04:31.783 --> 01:04:34.200
Don't...

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.325
Honey, I'm home!

01:04:38.325 --> 01:04:39.866
That's Brian.

01:04:39.866 --> 01:04:41.866
Look, I need to go,
but just remember,

01:04:41.866 --> 01:04:44.033
out of here
by tomorrow afternoon.

01:05:10.825 --> 01:05:12.825
Deputy Randall.

01:05:12.825 --> 01:05:14.700
Yes, Traci.

01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:16.534
You found what?

01:05:16.534 --> 01:05:18.534
It said Josh.

01:05:18.534 --> 01:05:20.575
In her stuff?

01:05:20.575 --> 01:05:22.825
Breezy.

01:05:22.825 --> 01:05:26.617
Vehicle registration came back
to a Clark, Josh Clark.

01:05:26.617 --> 01:05:29.700
Did you ever find the person
you were looking for?

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:31.367
The one that killed that boy.

01:05:31.367 --> 01:05:33.534
They just found
a dead body on the beach.

01:05:35.825 --> 01:05:37.158
What are these?

01:05:37.158 --> 01:05:38.866
Top secret police documents?

01:05:41.617 --> 01:05:42.950
Got out of your house now.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:44.659
Go directly to
the Sheriff's station.

01:05:44.659 --> 01:05:45.908
Don't make any stops.

01:05:57.450 --> 01:05:59.367
Hello, anyone here?

01:05:59.367 --> 01:06:01.866
Oh, hey,
we're actually not open yet.

01:06:01.866 --> 01:06:03.492
We open at 11:00.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.825
I'm not here for a drink.

01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:08.617
Okay, well, what can I
do for you then?

01:06:08.617 --> 01:06:10.575
I was hoping
Traci would be here.

01:06:10.575 --> 01:06:12.950
She wasn't home
when I got up this morning.

01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:14.950
Oh, yeah, you're her new tenant.

01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:17.075
I wanted to talk to her.

01:06:17.075 --> 01:06:19.117
We had a little bit
of a fight last night.

01:06:19.117 --> 01:06:22.033
Hmm, she's mentioned you
to me a couple of times.

01:06:22.033 --> 01:06:23.741
She can be a little nervous.

01:06:23.741 --> 01:06:25.866
There's nothing
to be nervous about.

01:06:25.866 --> 01:06:27.534
I'm perfectly harmless.

01:06:27.534 --> 01:06:29.033
I don't know about that.

01:06:29.033 --> 01:06:31.741
Do a lot of harm with
this hot bod of yours.

01:06:31.741 --> 01:06:33.700
Well, aren't you sweet?

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:35.700
So, when do you expect her?

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:38.700
Hmm...just a few minutes
before we open.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.741
You can come back then
if you want.

01:06:40.741 --> 01:06:42.700
I could, or I could just

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:45.450
hang out here,
if you don't mind.

01:06:45.450 --> 01:06:46.950
Well, I don't mind.

01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:49.659
Like I said though,
it's gonna be a few hours.

01:06:49.659 --> 01:06:51.450
Well, what could we

01:06:51.450 --> 01:06:53.659
possibly do in
those few hours?

01:06:53.659 --> 01:06:55.534
I've got a thought or two.

01:06:55.534 --> 01:06:57.325
I bet you do.

01:06:57.325 --> 01:06:59.283
But aren't you with that deputy?

01:06:59.283 --> 01:07:01.283
I'm not with him now.

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:06.575
Right here?

01:07:06.575 --> 01:07:08.200
Right here.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:49.200
Hold it right there!

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.700
Put your hands up!

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.617
Jesus, man.
She came on to me.

01:12:52.617 --> 01:12:54.783
Shut up, Charlie.
Step away from him, Breezy.

01:12:54.783 --> 01:12:56.450
One more move and I'll kill him.

01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:58.325
That's poison she has
right there, Charlie.

01:12:58.325 --> 01:12:59.741
Dude, if she's your girl...

01:12:59.741 --> 01:13:00.950
She's not my girl.

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:02.409
Aw, how can you say that?

01:13:02.409 --> 01:13:04.117
After everything
we've been through.

01:13:04.117 --> 01:13:06.450
Stay back. I mean it.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:09.325
This is where it ends, Brenda.
The DNA match came through.

01:13:09.325 --> 01:13:11.659
We know all about
your escapades back east,

01:13:11.659 --> 01:13:13.492
and your internship at
your father's chemical factory.

01:13:13.492 --> 01:13:14.866
My, my, you've been busy.

01:13:14.866 --> 01:13:16.492
How did you know
to find me here?

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:17.866
Traci called me.

01:13:17.866 --> 01:13:19.325
She found your bag of souvenirs.

01:13:19.325 --> 01:13:21.075
I figured you'd come back
here looking for her.

01:13:21.075 --> 01:13:23.158
You're so clever, Jeremy,

01:13:23.158 --> 01:13:24.492
too clever.

01:13:33.866 --> 01:13:36.242
It's Deputy Randall to you.

01:13:41.158 --> 01:13:44.409
I can't believe we had
a murderer living in our house.

01:13:44.409 --> 01:13:46.783
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

01:13:46.783 --> 01:13:49.991
It's not your fault.
How could you have known?

01:13:49.991 --> 01:13:54.242
Makes you wonder why she did
all those things, all those murders.

01:13:54.242 --> 01:13:56.200
Who can say?

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.409
Jilted lover, broken home.

01:13:58.409 --> 01:14:00.367
Maybe she just snapped one day.

01:14:00.367 --> 01:14:02.325
We'll probably
never know for sure.

01:14:02.325 --> 01:14:05.866
She had everyone fooled,
except you.

01:14:05.866 --> 01:14:09.659
I knew something was wrong about
her the minute she walked in,

01:14:09.659 --> 01:14:11.492
but we needed the money so bad.

01:14:11.492 --> 01:14:13.950
Ha, not anymore.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:17.741
Yeah, a $50,000 reward is
a pretty nice way to end this nightmare.

01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:20.534
Yeah, it's a good thing
Deputy Randall gave you

01:14:20.534 --> 01:14:22.783
the credit for
turning him onto Breezy.

01:14:22.783 --> 01:14:24.908
You mean, it's a good thing
I'm a snoop.

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:27.075
Yeah, that too.

01:14:27.075 --> 01:14:28.659
And now that

01:14:28.659 --> 01:14:29.950
my tuition is paid for,

01:14:29.950 --> 01:14:32.534
you can stop working
those double shifts.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:34.117
Thank God.

01:14:34.117 --> 01:14:38.367
And, when I graduate
and have that nice, cushy job,

01:14:38.367 --> 01:14:42.325
maybe we can start talking
about having a family again.

01:14:42.325 --> 01:14:45.741
That would be wonderful.

01:14:45.741 --> 01:14:47.575
I love you.

01:14:47.575 --> 01:14:49.409
I love you.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.825
What are these?
Top secret police documents?

01:15:03.242 --> 01:15:04.617
Oh, so, do I have to

01:15:04.617 --> 01:15:07.200
commit a crime
or something to see you?

01:15:12.409 --> 01:15:13.950
Maybe you're right.

01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:25.991
They just found
a dead body on the beach.

01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:38.866
Yeah, and in the meantime, my wife is
schlepping booze to drunks on a nightly basis.

01:15:44.200 --> 01:15:47.033
Hey, that table's had enough, okay?
They're cut off.

01:15:47.033 --> 01:15:48.866
She goes out,
next time she does,

01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:51.033
sneak in her room,
look through her shit.

01:15:55.534 --> 01:15:57.659
You know
I don't normally do this,

01:15:57.659 --> 01:16:00.575
you know, like, go home with
someone I just met at a bar.

01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:27.575
