WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:04.105
We're so happy you
could come have lunch

00:04.138 --> 00:06.607
with your father
and me, Fluttershy.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.342
I'm so glad you asked.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.778
And it was super awesome
of you to invite me too.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.381
Things have been so busy
with the Wonderbolts lately;

00:13.414 --> 00:16.617
it's great to get a chance
to relax someplace quiet.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.653
That's exactly what I intend
to do now that I've retired.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.455
In fact, I converted
the back house

00:21.489 --> 00:24.158
to showcase my
cloud collection.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.827
I have my clouds; your
mom has her flowers;

00:26.860 --> 00:28.696
you've got your animals
and your brother...

00:31.132 --> 00:35.136
Zephyr Breeze has
his... interests.

00:35.169 --> 00:38.506
I'll say. Remember when he
was convinced square clouds

00:38.539 --> 00:41.542
were gonna be the next
big thing? [snort]

00:41.575 --> 00:44.112
He's matured a
lot since then.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.614
Actually, it's funny
you bring Zephyr up.

00:49.317 --> 00:52.653
Oh, no! Not again.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.289
It's just for a
little while, dear.

00:55.323 --> 00:57.791
Till he gets back
on his hooves.

00:57.825 --> 00:59.627
Wait. You don't mean?

00:59.660 --> 01:02.296
Guess who's home?

01:02.330 --> 01:04.265
That's right, big sis,
it's your one and only,

01:04.298 --> 01:06.100
favorite little
brother... moi!

01:07.335 --> 01:08.202
Awww.

01:12.273 --> 01:15.609
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:15.643 --> 01:17.578
* Aaaahhh

01:17.611 --> 01:19.580
* My little Pony

01:19.613 --> 01:22.183
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:22.216 --> 01:23.851
* My Little Pony

01:23.884 --> 01:26.520
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:26.554 --> 01:28.556
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:28.589 --> 01:30.724
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:30.758 --> 01:32.826
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:32.860 --> 01:34.862
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:34.895 --> 01:37.198
* To have my little pony

01:37.231 --> 01:40.501
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:40.534 --> 01:43.404
**

01:47.941 --> 01:49.343
[splat]

01:49.377 --> 01:50.811
Hi, Flutter-butter!

01:50.844 --> 01:53.781
How's the bestest
big sister ever?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.916
Hey, where's the love?

01:55.949 --> 01:57.885
How about a little excitement
to see your baby brother?

02:00.388 --> 02:01.855
I'm just surprised.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.359
When you left, you said mane
therapy was your calling.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.862
Oh, it is, sis. It is. You would
not believe how much stress

02:08.896 --> 02:11.299
ponies hold in
their manes.

02:11.332 --> 02:14.168
Everything gets limp
and unmanageable.

02:14.202 --> 02:17.371
No offense, but brushing alone
won't solve the problem.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.509
What went wrong?

02:21.542 --> 02:24.378
Nothing went wrong
per se.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.548
It's just "the powers that
be" were so locked into their

02:27.581 --> 02:30.818
"required styles"
and you know me.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.254
I've got my own style
and I think they were

02:33.287 --> 02:34.222
a little threatened.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.694
Oh, this is lovely, dear.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.663
Ugh.

02:42.696 --> 02:48.436
Well, if it isn't Rainbows "the
best flier that ever was" Dash.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.738
Oh, this ought be good.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.906
Sorry, I shouldn't
tease ya.

02:52.940 --> 02:56.610
I know the whole "super awesome
flyer" bit's just to impress me.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.379
[gasp]

02:58.412 --> 03:01.349
Still, thanks for showing up for
my homecoming, it's, it's sweet.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.916
[gasp]

03:02.950 --> 03:05.386
I kinda thought there'd
be more ponies here.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.856
I mean, what about your party
planner friend? Sprinkle Pie?

03:08.889 --> 03:12.860
She coulda turned this into a
real house par-tay, am I right?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.695
I mean, this place
could use it.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.431
* Dra-ahb!

03:17.465 --> 03:18.699
I, I ...

03:18.732 --> 03:21.969
We have been meaning
to redecorate.

03:22.002 --> 03:25.373
Dad, please, when I get all my
stuff back in here, you won't

03:25.406 --> 03:27.575
even remember what this
boring old place looked like.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.583
Um, Mom, Dad? Can I talk
to you for a second?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.354
What is it, honey?

03:40.388 --> 03:43.624
I'm not so sure letting Zephyr
move back home is a good idea.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.259
I know you both
want to help,

03:45.293 --> 03:47.395
but don't you
remember last time?

03:47.428 --> 03:50.564
Zephyr's just trying to
find his place, dear.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.701
I know. It just seems like
his place always ends up

03:53.734 --> 03:55.469
being your place.

03:55.503 --> 03:58.972
And then he sort of makes
you do everything for him.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.443
Well, we may not be as
bold as you, Fluttershy,

04:02.476 --> 04:05.513
but don't you worry. We know
how to stand up for ourselves.

04:07.915 --> 04:11.652
And they were all like, "We
love your free spirit, Zeph

04:11.685 --> 04:15.323
and it would be wrong to cage
that. Go follow your dreams."

04:16.557 --> 04:17.425
[thud]

04:19.893 --> 04:22.930
Zeph was just telling me
all about the ins and outs

04:22.963 --> 04:25.599
of Mane Therapy School.

04:25.633 --> 04:30.471
It's all so political. I
just could not take it.

04:30.504 --> 04:33.874
Well, maybe if you stuck with
it for more than a few weeks?

04:33.907 --> 04:36.610
Sorry, sis, but when
something's not the right fit,

04:36.644 --> 04:38.011
this pony's gotta fly!

04:40.614 --> 04:42.650
Anyway, good talk, Rainbows.

04:42.683 --> 04:45.553
I am so touched you
came to see me, really,

04:45.586 --> 04:47.421
I hate to deprive
you of my presence,

04:47.455 --> 04:49.957
but this Breeze needs his Zs.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.760
You know it's the middle
of the day, right?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.396
I know. SIESTA!

04:55.429 --> 04:57.331
I'm just gonna assume
you made up my room

04:57.365 --> 04:59.500
the way I like
it, right, Mom?

04:59.533 --> 05:02.336
Ooh, I almost forgot. All
my stuff is out front.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.071
Wanna grab that for
me, Pops? Thanks!

05:05.539 --> 05:08.075
[sigh] Same old "Zeph."

05:13.647 --> 05:16.083
I know you weren't expecting
to see your brother,

05:16.116 --> 05:20.388
but you've been kinda
quiet. Even for you.

05:20.421 --> 05:25.693
I'm sorry, but I am just
so... so peeved right now!

05:25.726 --> 05:26.594
[gasp]

05:27.961 --> 05:29.363
Excuse my language.

05:31.732 --> 05:36.504
Rainbow Dash! Fluttershy! It's
me, Pinkie Pie! Your friend!

05:38.772 --> 05:39.873
[whistle]

05:42.042 --> 05:44.645
Oh, um, sorry about that.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.747
We just had lunch with
Fluttershy's parents

05:46.780 --> 05:49.517
and you'll never
guess who showed up.

05:49.550 --> 05:53.621
Ooh, Mayor Mare? Cranky Doodle
Donkey? Cheese Sandwich?

05:53.654 --> 05:55.656
Miss Harshwhinny?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.725
Zephyr Breeze.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.993
Oh, that makes more sense.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.729
And from the look
on your face,

06:01.762 --> 06:05.466
I'm guessing it's for another
one of his 'extended' stays.

06:05.499 --> 06:08.902
She's a bit peeved.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.971
Zephyr is my brother
and I love him,

06:11.004 --> 06:13.441
but he's never learned to
do anything for himself

06:13.474 --> 06:15.509
and I don't know why my
parents keep letting him

06:15.543 --> 06:17.144
trot all over them.

06:17.177 --> 06:20.414
Well, if your parents won't
stand up for themselves,

06:20.448 --> 06:22.850
maybe you need to
stand up for them.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.852
You know, you're right.

06:31.925 --> 06:32.893
[clatter]

06:32.926 --> 06:33.827
[gasp]

06:36.730 --> 06:37.898
[crash]

06:37.931 --> 06:40.033
Zephyr Breeze!

06:40.067 --> 06:43.771
Oh, hey sis! Come to see me work
my magic and turn this place

06:43.804 --> 06:47.741
from drab to fab, huh?
Well, watch and learn!

06:47.775 --> 06:50.478
Can't you see what
you're doing?

06:50.511 --> 06:52.713
Yeah, I'm getting
rid of this old stuff

06:52.746 --> 06:55.483
so I can turn the back
house into my art studio.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.719
I've decided I'm going
to be a sculptor!

06:58.752 --> 07:01.489
I'm talking about
Mom's flowers.

07:01.522 --> 07:04.625
She's gonna move them so I can
have my meditation patio here.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.761
She loves replanting
stuff, don't you, Mom?

07:10.197 --> 07:12.633
And Dad's been collecting
his favorite bits of cloud

07:12.666 --> 07:14.868
from the factory since
before you were born.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.872
The very best from
every production run

07:18.906 --> 07:21.074
since my first day
on the job.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.043
[smashing glass]

07:23.076 --> 07:26.480
But why hold onto
the past, really?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.248
You can't just fly in
and change everything

07:28.281 --> 07:30.518
Mom and Dad have
built here.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.152
But this is the only
place big enough

07:32.185 --> 07:34.788
for my studio/meditation
garden.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.657
Ooh, unless I do it
in the living room!

07:38.726 --> 07:42.530
I know speaking up for yourself
can be hard, believe me.

07:42.563 --> 07:45.766
But Zephyr will never stand on
his own if he can lean on you.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.636
Don't be so
dramatic, sis.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.239
Mom and Dad just want
to let me be me, right?

07:52.272 --> 07:55.042
I can do plenty on my own.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.646
I agree. Which is why
you should move out.

07:58.679 --> 08:03.083
Oh. Well, I mean,
I totally would.

08:03.116 --> 08:06.720
But I don't think that's
what Mom and Dad want.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.690
It's not, is it?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.759
Uh...

08:11.792 --> 08:15.696
You know we love you, son.
But your sister has a point.

08:18.566 --> 08:22.836
Sure. I mean, I really
just came back here to keep

08:22.870 --> 08:27.307
you guys company. But
whatever's best for the family.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.078
I just...I just gotta
grab a few essentials.

08:31.111 --> 08:35.215
And you definitely have
somewhere else to go?

08:35.248 --> 08:37.918
Of course! There's plenty
of ponies who'd love

08:37.951 --> 08:40.588
for a little Breeze
to blow their way.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.030
So, where's Zeph
gonna go now?

08:50.063 --> 08:54.334
I'm not sure. Oh, I hope
I did the right thing.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.304
Are you kidding?
One hundred percent!

08:57.337 --> 09:04.044
Hey sis, your new
roomie's here!

09:04.077 --> 09:05.979
OK, maybe like
seventy percent.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.985
Um, Zephyr?

09:12.019 --> 09:14.622
When Mom and Dad told you to
find someplace else to live,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.223
I don't think
they meant here.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.626
Well, it's not
their house,

09:18.659 --> 09:21.028
so by definition
it's someplace else.

09:23.897 --> 09:27.601
Am I right, Rainbows? Stop
oogling me and help settle this.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.607
You know what? I totally
forgot that I promised

09:33.641 --> 09:36.644
to help Pinkie Pie...
sprinkle... something.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.148
You said you had
plenty of places to go.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.119
Fine! You can stay here--

09:46.153 --> 09:49.256
You're the best! We're
gonna have so much fun--

09:49.289 --> 09:51.124
--on one condition.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.026
Totally. Anything.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.261
You have to get a job.

09:56.263 --> 10:00.067
Crackin' the whip, huh? You
always were kinda bossy.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.869
Zephyr Breeze!

10:01.902 --> 10:03.937
Kidding! Get a
job. Absolutely.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.981
[rooster crows]

10:14.014 --> 10:18.185
[yawning] Where are
we going so early?

10:18.218 --> 10:22.890
You have no idea how bad
morning sun is for your mane.

10:22.923 --> 10:26.159
Remember how we talked
about you getting a job?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.996
It was just yesterday. And
it's totally on my to-do list.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.898
But you can't expect
me to find something

10:30.931 --> 10:33.701
befitting my
awesomeness overnight.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.002
I thought you might
say that.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.737
[knock knock]

10:36.770 --> 10:38.238
So I did it for you.

10:38.271 --> 10:39.940
What?

10:39.973 --> 10:42.943
These fabrics all need
to be dyed those colors.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.712
Do you think you
can handle that?

10:44.745 --> 10:47.380
Um...I don't know.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.149
You get started while
Fluttershy and I

10:49.182 --> 10:50.951
head to the store
for more supplies.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.919
Ta-ta!

10:51.952 --> 10:52.920
Good luck!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.087
[door closes]

11:02.029 --> 11:04.131
Thanks for giving
my brother a job.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.333
I just hope he's
up to the task.

11:06.366 --> 11:10.738
Oh darling, dyeing fabric
is the simplest thing.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.305
You just dip cloth
in a bowl.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.807
[horrified gasp]

11:16.276 --> 11:18.779
* [happy humming]

11:18.812 --> 11:21.081
Rarity! You're back!

11:21.114 --> 11:23.050
What did you do?

11:23.083 --> 11:24.985
Since you talk to
animals all the time,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.787
I just figured it
runs in the family,

11:26.820 --> 11:29.022
so why not outsource
this stuff, you know?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.225
Turns out the animal
communication thing

11:32.259 --> 11:33.761
isn't genetic.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.030
Zephyr! I asked
you to do this job,

11:37.064 --> 11:40.433
not to pawn it off on
innocent woodland creatures.

11:40.467 --> 11:44.504
OK. I guess you have some
feelings about this,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.940
but you should know it's
basically your cat's fault

11:46.974 --> 11:49.309
for walking by and
giving me the idea.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.344
But I'm actually
kinda into this look.

11:51.378 --> 11:55.415
So, I guess what I'm saying
is... you're welcome.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.318
Wha-- Oh, uggh.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.822
Zephyr, this is
just unacceptable!

12:01.855 --> 12:06.159
Wow. I guess I know when my
efforts aren't appreciated!

12:08.028 --> 12:08.996
[exasperated groan]

12:09.029 --> 12:09.863
[door closes]

12:09.897 --> 12:11.298
[nervous giggle]

12:11.331 --> 12:15.202
Whoa, those are tall.

12:15.235 --> 12:18.171
I'm glad you noticed because
they're your new job.

12:18.205 --> 12:19.773
Wha-?

12:19.807 --> 12:22.509
You said you were taking me
to tea with the princess.

12:22.542 --> 12:26.013
Actually, I said I was going
to tea with the princess.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.215
You're going to work.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.550
Sis, c'mon!

12:30.583 --> 12:33.053
Don't worry, Zephyr.
It'll be easy.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.189
I just need a Pegasus pony to
fly up and wipe each window down

12:36.223 --> 12:38.425
from top to bottom.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.460
And I'm here to make
sure you do it right!

12:46.599 --> 12:49.402
Wow, Zephyr, this
looks amazing!

12:49.436 --> 12:51.404
Well, you know, like
you said, it was easy.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.407
Where's Spike?

12:54.441 --> 12:56.343
Up here!

12:56.376 --> 12:59.880
You were supposed to supervise,
not do all the work.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.883
I was supervising! And
then Zephyr asked me about

13:02.916 --> 13:04.885
different cleaning techniques
and which one was best

13:04.918 --> 13:06.019
and if I could--

13:06.053 --> 13:09.156
Hey! I did all
the work.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.425
Don't let him fool you, ol'
Spike is quite the taskmaster.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.499
Oh, come on, sis.

13:19.532 --> 13:22.435
I had to ask Spike to make
sure I was doing it right.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.271
You didn't do it at all!

13:26.639 --> 13:29.609
Well, I guarantee there
won't be any fooling around

13:29.642 --> 13:31.311
on the next job.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.880
Next job?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.581
[whoosh]

13:34.614 --> 13:38.518
That's right, Zeph.
You're coming with me.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.487
You don't have to come
up with some excuse

13:40.520 --> 13:42.622
to hang out with
me, Rainbows.

13:42.655 --> 13:47.260
Let's just go for a fly and
see where the day takes us.

13:47.294 --> 13:51.264
Ugh, we're going to
Wonderbolts' Headquarters

13:51.298 --> 13:55.268
and I am going to give you a job
so simple and straightforward,

13:55.302 --> 13:58.105
not even you can weasel
your way out of it.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.139
And the second you try,

13:59.172 --> 14:02.109
I'm going to zap you with
a storm cloud. Got it?

14:02.142 --> 14:06.046
Oh, I got it. I can already feel
the electricity between us.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.089
Zephyr: Rainbow
Dash is crazy, OK?

14:16.123 --> 14:18.992
She expects me to do stuff right
when she asks me to do it!

14:19.026 --> 14:20.093
It's insane!

14:20.127 --> 14:22.662
So you just quit? Again?

14:22.695 --> 14:24.932
Escaped is more like it.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.300
Besides, what was
I supposed to do?

14:27.334 --> 14:30.270
Keep trying? Finish
something for once?

14:30.303 --> 14:33.907
Maybe that way, you'd actually
find something you like to do.

14:33.941 --> 14:38.045
That all sounds fine for your
friends, but it's just not me.

14:38.078 --> 14:41.214
Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I
don't think you can live here.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.219
Fine. I'll just go
live in the woods

14:46.253 --> 14:48.155
like my foreponies before me.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.563
Guess the only breeze this
Zephyr can count on is his own.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.108
Aww cheer up, Fluttershy.

15:08.141 --> 15:11.111
I know it was hard, but
you did the right thing.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.346
You couldn't let Zephyr
pull the same stuff on you

15:13.380 --> 15:15.448
that he's always
pulled on your folks.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.117
I guess so.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.152
[bird chirps]

15:19.186 --> 15:20.320
Oh, hello Constance.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.388
[chirps]

15:21.421 --> 15:22.990
Oh? Oh, dear.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.063
See, Wigford, The Breeze needs
nopony. We've got food...

15:30.097 --> 15:31.264
Shelter...

15:31.298 --> 15:32.932
Just need to put
the ol' kettle on.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.210
Come on, stickie-stickie
make with the sparks.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.577
[clank clank clank]

15:47.247 --> 15:51.084
Ugh! What's a pony gotta do to
find a decent stick around here?

15:51.118 --> 15:53.120
[grunts]

15:59.026 --> 16:03.030
I know he needs to learn to
do things for himself, but...

16:03.063 --> 16:04.964
I can't let him
live like this.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.203
Actually, I don't think he'd
make it through the night.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.712
Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um,
cozying up in my sleeping bag.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.681
Ready to call it
an early night.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.184
Such an exhausting
day, you know?

16:26.386 --> 16:28.788
It's noon.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.690
You know me: siesta!

16:32.325 --> 16:33.193
[clunk]

16:34.561 --> 16:39.066
UGH! I can't do this.
I can't do anything.

16:39.099 --> 16:41.434
Zephyr, you're
smart and talented.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.537
You could do anything
if you just tried.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.374
And what if I give everything
I have and still fail?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.277
Honestly, I think it's
better not to try at all.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.246
But then you won't
ever do anything.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.615
I don't expect you
two to understand.

16:55.648 --> 16:58.385
I mean, when have
you ever failed?

16:58.418 --> 17:01.621
You've literally helped save
Equestria, like, a dozen times.

17:01.654 --> 17:04.591
And I was worried that
I'd fail every time.

17:04.624 --> 17:08.695
Sometimes you have to do things
even though you might fail.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.663
But failing is the worst!

17:10.697 --> 17:14.101
And quitting doesn't feel
much better, does it?
No.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.636
So here's the deal: You
can come back with me,

17:16.669 --> 17:20.039
but you have to do exactly
what I say, no exceptions.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.777
I will literally do
anything you ask me

17:24.811 --> 17:27.180
if it means I don't
have to stay here.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.520
OK, you know what you
have to do, right?

17:33.553 --> 17:35.622
Beg for help, then quit
when I get frustrated.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.094
Just kidding. Total
opposite of that. Got it.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.698
You think he can do it?

17:45.732 --> 17:48.535
* Everypony has times
in their lives *

17:48.568 --> 17:51.138
* when their hearts
are filled with doubt *

17:51.171 --> 17:54.107
* Frustration builds up inside

17:54.141 --> 17:57.210
* and it makes you
want to shout *

17:57.244 --> 17:59.512
* But if you just
take that first step *

17:59.546 --> 18:02.615
* the next one will appear

18:02.649 --> 18:05.552
* And you'll find you
can walk, then run, *

18:05.585 --> 18:12.359
* then fly into
the stratosphere *

18:12.392 --> 18:17.197
**

18:17.230 --> 18:19.299
* You've got to give
it your best *

18:19.332 --> 18:22.535
* so you can
pass the test *

18:22.569 --> 18:27.674
* Give it everything
that you've got *

18:27.707 --> 18:29.909
* And we know you can win

18:29.942 --> 18:33.146
* You just have to begin

18:33.180 --> 18:37.384
* Have to give it
your very best shot *

18:37.417 --> 18:39.886
**

18:39.919 --> 18:43.490
* There are times when
you want to give up *

18:43.523 --> 18:50.363
* when you think that
you can't go on *

18:50.397 --> 18:54.367
* But if you fight through
with all of your might *

18:54.401 --> 18:59.772
* You will find that
you can't go wrong *

18:59.806 --> 19:03.843
* That you could do
it all along! *

19:03.876 --> 19:06.646
* Everypony has times
in their lives *

19:06.679 --> 19:09.682
* When their hearts
are filled with doubt *

19:09.716 --> 19:12.352
* But if you just
give it your all, *

19:12.385 --> 19:15.288
* you'll start to work it out

19:15.322 --> 19:20.693
* And I know I can't give up too
soon, get myself in the zone. *

19:20.727 --> 19:23.963
* And I find I can
walk then run... *

19:23.996 --> 19:28.435
* Then flyyyyyy

19:28.468 --> 19:31.938
* I can do it on my own!

19:34.541 --> 19:39.846
* You can do it on your own!

19:39.879 --> 19:46.819
* I can do it on my own!
I can do it on my own. *

19:49.256 --> 19:52.792
I did it. I actually finished
something. By myself.

19:52.825 --> 19:55.228
And it looks exactly
like it's supposed to.

19:55.262 --> 19:56.929
I knew you could do
it, Zephyr.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.565
I didn't!

19:58.598 --> 20:02.669
But I do now. Thanks, for
believing in me, sis.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.738
That's what big
sisters are for.

20:05.772 --> 20:10.343
So, Zeph, now that you've
accomplished this, what's next?

20:10.377 --> 20:14.414
Anything I want! I mean,
the sky's the limit, right?

20:16.649 --> 20:20.287
But, you know, I've got
some baby steps in mind.

20:22.289 --> 20:26.359
Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs.
Shy. It was great, as usual.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.729
Thank you, dear, for
not giving up on Zephyr.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.031
After all these years
of pining for him,

20:32.064 --> 20:35.535
it must be so satisfying to
see him on the right track.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.707
Have you heard from
Zephyr? Is he doing well?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.975
I tell you, he's
a brand new pony.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.612
So full of drive
and determination.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.714
That's great.

20:47.747 --> 20:51.651
Guess who graduated from
mane therapy training?

20:54.654 --> 20:56.289
Awesome!

20:56.323 --> 20:57.690
Congratulations, son.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.529
You look so handsome!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.664
I'm so proud of
you, Zephyr.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.433
It was only a
matter of time

21:06.466 --> 21:10.036
before they recognized
my true genius.

21:10.069 --> 21:13.606
But actually doing the
work probably helped.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.509
And I wouldn't have
if it weren't for you.

21:16.543 --> 21:18.845
Oh I just gave you
some encouragement;

21:18.878 --> 21:21.013
you did this on your own.

21:21.047 --> 21:24.784
And honestly, right now I
feel like I can do anything.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.320
Except find a place.

21:27.354 --> 21:30.289
I can still crash here
for a few days, right?

21:34.394 --> 21:36.396
* My Little Pony

21:38.598 --> 21:40.600
* My Little Pony

21:51.611 --> 21:53.680
* My Little Pony

21:53.713 --> 21:57.717
* friends
