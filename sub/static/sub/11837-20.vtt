WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:02.368
WILSON: Previously
on The Practice.

00:02.402 --> 00:04.003
YOUNG: Alan Shore
thinks he got fired

00:04.037 --> 00:06.139
because we were afraid
he'd bring the firm down.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.241
He's already brought us down.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.677
Our lives are that law firm.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.679
Working together,
that's something.

00:12.713 --> 00:14.114
I might even call that
"everything."

00:14.147 --> 00:16.517
Most paralegals request
not to work with me.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.218
And just so you know,
I am totally fine

00:18.251 --> 00:19.252
with being hated.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.987
Sally, if you dress
like that,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.523
people will get
the right idea about you.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.257
Please go home and change.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.326
HEEP: My legal skills
are excellent.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.161
I shouldn't get punished

00:28.194 --> 00:29.462
because my skirts are short.

00:29.495 --> 00:30.897
And you can tell Hannah,

00:30.931 --> 00:32.165
I might hit her.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.266
I don't care
if she's a partner.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.501
If she keeps treating me
like this,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.970
I'm gonna hit her.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.238
I had this dope deal coming up.

00:38.271 --> 00:39.606
I didn't tell no one

00:39.640 --> 00:41.241
except Gigi Cooley,
my girlfriend.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.443
All of a sudden, the Feds
are busting down my door.

00:43.476 --> 00:46.212
I think the FBI bugged me
in my buttocks.

00:46.246 --> 00:47.781
BERLUTI: I want to take
this case.

00:47.814 --> 00:49.415
We're voting two to one
to turn it down.

00:49.449 --> 00:51.451
FRUTT: Leaving because you
couldn't take that case?

00:51.484 --> 00:52.919
YOUNG: How can you even think
of leaving?

00:52.953 --> 00:54.120
You are.
You interviewed

00:54.154 --> 00:55.956
with Hollings
and Gray last month.

00:55.989 --> 00:56.923
I declined.

00:56.957 --> 00:57.991
But not the interview.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.860
You considered leaving,
Eugene.

01:02.603 --> 01:04.004
STRINGER: I do not do
secretarial work.

01:04.037 --> 01:05.606
YOUNG: Lucy will be in
at noon.

01:05.639 --> 01:07.574
Fine, then have her do it.
I have cases.

01:07.608 --> 01:09.342
Jamie, come on. It's--

01:09.375 --> 01:11.177
Eugene, may I speak
to you a second?

01:13.079 --> 01:15.248
I thought we concluded
our conversation.

01:15.281 --> 01:17.117
This will just take a second.

01:17.150 --> 01:17.918
Please.

01:28.228 --> 01:29.996
What's that about?

01:30.030 --> 01:30.997
That was Kevin Stadler.

01:31.031 --> 01:32.265
He's from Hollings and Gray,

01:32.298 --> 01:34.334
the firm that Eugene
interviewed for.

01:35.602 --> 01:37.103
I thought
he turned that down.

01:42.843 --> 01:45.011
STADLER: I really
wasn't interviewing you

01:45.045 --> 01:47.080
on behalf of our firm, Eugene.

01:49.683 --> 01:51.317
What do you mean?

01:51.351 --> 01:52.519
STADLER: I don't know
if you're familiar

01:52.553 --> 01:54.320
with Governor Romney's new

01:54.354 --> 01:56.422
judicial nominating process.

01:56.456 --> 01:59.159
The first round
is completely blind.

01:59.192 --> 02:01.101
The governor feels
it can be much more...

02:01.134 --> 02:02.636
merit-based that way.

02:02.669 --> 02:05.171
I was engaged
by the governor's counsel

02:05.205 --> 02:07.874
as an early screener.

02:07.908 --> 02:10.376
What are you talking about?

02:10.410 --> 02:12.045
I was interviewing you

02:12.078 --> 02:14.915
as a potential
superior-court judge.

02:18.952 --> 02:21.387
A judge?

02:21.421 --> 02:23.356
If you're interested,

02:23.389 --> 02:25.592
I'd love to submit your name
to the governor's counsel.

02:26.727 --> 02:29.329
To be a superior-court judge?

02:29.362 --> 02:32.032
To be a superior-court judge.

02:38.539 --> 02:40.541
(music playing)

03:18.585 --> 03:19.586
BERLUTI: Get the doctor's report

03:19.620 --> 03:20.821
and then we'll talk, okay?

03:20.854 --> 03:21.822
Thanks, Jimmy.

03:21.855 --> 03:22.823
QUINN: Jimmy.

03:22.856 --> 03:24.257
Manny, hey! Gigi!

03:24.290 --> 03:25.258
COLEY: Hi.

03:25.291 --> 03:26.960
BERLUTI: Go
in the conference room.

03:26.993 --> 03:27.828
PAPP: Hey,

03:27.861 --> 03:29.395
you said
you would take me next.

03:29.429 --> 03:30.564
BERLUTI: Ten minutes,
Mr. Papp.

03:30.597 --> 03:33.133
Ah, this is discrimination.

03:33.166 --> 03:34.568
PAPONI: Millie Trevalli,
her husband bit her.

03:34.601 --> 03:35.602
She wants to sue.
TREVALLI: Right in the side.

03:35.636 --> 03:37.237
I'll be with you
as soon as I can.

03:37.270 --> 03:39.105
Suzy, could you get
Mrs. Trevalli some coffee?

03:39.139 --> 03:41.074
PAPONI: I'd love some myself,
we don't got any.

03:41.107 --> 03:42.275
Maybe you could get some.

03:42.308 --> 03:44.177
PAPONI: Oh, yeah,
like I got nothing to do.

03:45.478 --> 03:47.113
Gigi, hey.
COLEY: Hi.

03:47.147 --> 03:48.048
Congratulations.

03:48.081 --> 03:49.182
COLEY: Oh, thanks.

03:49.215 --> 03:51.417
The happiest moment
in my life.

03:51.451 --> 03:52.252
BERLUTI: Look,

03:52.285 --> 03:54.220
I talked to both E. R. doctors

03:54.254 --> 03:55.188
who treated you.

03:55.221 --> 03:56.923
They claim there was no device

03:56.957 --> 03:58.358
inserted into your person.

03:58.391 --> 03:59.693
QUINN: Well, of course
they're gonna say that.

03:59.726 --> 04:00.834
Manny.
They must have got

04:00.867 --> 04:02.302
some mind-reading psychic.

04:02.335 --> 04:03.770
And going into a person's head,

04:03.804 --> 04:05.471
you should need a warrant
for that, too.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.240
This is how he got labeled.

04:07.273 --> 04:08.542
I got a buddy in the bureau.

04:08.575 --> 04:09.643
I'll talk to him,

04:09.676 --> 04:11.512
but we need to think

04:11.545 --> 04:12.546
about a plea.

04:12.579 --> 04:13.847
Look, never mind "plea."

04:13.880 --> 04:15.248
I got a friend,

04:15.281 --> 04:17.450
and I can give them
something they want, Jimmy.

04:17.483 --> 04:19.418
My friend spent some time
in the oil business,

04:19.452 --> 04:21.187
and he knows where they are.

04:21.221 --> 04:22.155
Knows where who are?

04:22.188 --> 04:24.891
Not who, what.

04:24.925 --> 04:27.393
The weapons of mass destruction.

04:30.697 --> 04:32.432
The FBI's been trying
to redeem themselves

04:32.465 --> 04:33.933
in this arena.

04:33.967 --> 04:35.168
You get the charges dropped,

04:35.201 --> 04:37.604
I'll give them the big W. M. D.

04:37.637 --> 04:39.673
This could be
why they went into my ass

04:39.706 --> 04:41.307
to begin with

04:41.341 --> 04:42.876
to gather intelligence.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.249
MAN (over TV): Oh,
that was a sucker punch!

04:49.282 --> 04:50.917
Oh, both men
are down on the ice,

04:50.951 --> 04:52.485
and sears is not letting up!

04:52.519 --> 04:53.854
The referee is trying to...

04:55.822 --> 04:58.258
SHORE: Gee, you're certainly
a good hockey player.

04:58.291 --> 04:59.993
So, what did this man do,

05:00.026 --> 05:01.067
steal your puck?

05:01.101 --> 05:02.803
He took out
one of our best players

05:02.836 --> 05:04.204
a few weeks ago.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.072
Took out? On a date?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.207
Excuse me.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.008
New guy,

05:09.610 --> 05:10.811
I wouldn't want
the client to think

05:10.844 --> 05:13.046
we're not taking
this seriously.

05:13.079 --> 05:14.848
Maybe you should take over

05:14.881 --> 05:16.416
so I can observe.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.487
Mike, the problem we have,

05:21.522 --> 05:22.923
in addition
to the attack itself,

05:22.956 --> 05:24.691
you went on record
the night before as saying

05:24.725 --> 05:25.826
you were gonna get him.

05:25.859 --> 05:27.127
So it's difficult
for us to say

05:27.160 --> 05:28.962
it was some sudden
outbreak of emotion.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.296
Do you see our dilemma?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.836
A word of reply
would be helpful.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.537
A whole sentence

05:36.570 --> 05:39.072
would be positively stunning.

05:41.642 --> 05:44.077
Mention has been made
of "the code."

05:44.110 --> 05:45.946
What exactly is "the code"?

05:45.979 --> 05:48.381
It means, if you take out
one of our guys,

05:48.414 --> 05:49.816
we'll go after one of yours.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.818
It's, you know, payback, eh?

05:51.852 --> 05:53.587
I'd need you to drop the "eh."

05:53.620 --> 05:54.755
it sounds Canadian.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.122
I am Canadian.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.157
SHORE: I realize this,

05:57.190 --> 05:58.959
but I'd like
to paint you American.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.701
See, in America,

06:00.734 --> 06:02.435
if somebody commits a vicious,

06:02.468 --> 06:04.070
unprovoked attack,

06:04.104 --> 06:05.906
best to cloak it
with patriotism.

06:10.911 --> 06:12.145
Oh, hello.

06:12.178 --> 06:14.480
I can see
you're observing again.

06:14.515 --> 06:17.283
Am I knotted
tightly enough for you?

06:19.753 --> 06:20.621
A judge?

06:20.654 --> 06:22.288
Can you believe it?

06:22.322 --> 06:23.890
No.

06:23.924 --> 06:25.025
I mean, I can.

06:25.058 --> 06:26.492
I can believe

06:26.527 --> 06:28.261
you'd be a great candidate.

06:31.665 --> 06:34.535
So would this be something

06:34.568 --> 06:35.836
you might be interested in?

06:40.707 --> 06:42.208
Eugene,

06:42.242 --> 06:43.744
I think it would be great.

06:43.777 --> 06:44.578
I do.

06:47.180 --> 06:48.815
It would be fabulous if--

06:48.849 --> 06:50.851
First of all,
it's not at the point

06:50.884 --> 06:52.853
where I even have to ask myself
whether or not--

06:52.886 --> 06:55.589
Eugene, clearly,
it is at that point.

06:55.622 --> 06:58.191
If you're interested,
the process continues.

06:58.224 --> 06:59.292
If you're not--

07:06.039 --> 07:08.308
so, are you?

07:08.341 --> 07:11.177
I don't know.

07:11.211 --> 07:13.313
It is all so sudden,
and, um, I--

07:17.684 --> 07:19.620
I just need to think.

07:32.265 --> 07:33.800
Is there a reason
we're having drinks

07:33.834 --> 07:34.901
at a frat house?

07:35.569 --> 07:38.038
It's not normally
like this.

07:38.505 --> 07:40.240
Why am I here at all?

07:40.273 --> 07:41.975
Because I think
we need to set

07:42.008 --> 07:43.544
some ground rules.

07:43.777 --> 07:45.211
How are we doing?

07:45.245 --> 07:47.247
We're having
a private conversation.

07:54.320 --> 07:55.221
I saw that.

07:55.255 --> 07:56.757
Saw what?

07:56.790 --> 07:58.291
We need to be clear
on a few things,

07:58.324 --> 07:59.793
Mr. Shore.

07:59.826 --> 08:00.934
If you--

08:03.870 --> 08:05.271
Something wrong,

08:05.305 --> 08:06.272
other than your nature?

08:07.440 --> 08:08.742
I will be right back.

08:14.414 --> 08:17.350
(crowd cheering)

08:55.922 --> 08:57.758
If you won't fire her,
I will.

08:57.791 --> 09:00.026
We can't summarily hire
and fire people. It's just--

09:00.060 --> 09:02.769
Denny Crane
summarily hired Alan Shore.

09:02.803 --> 09:04.037
He's Denny Crane.
You're not.

09:04.070 --> 09:06.106
ROSE: Look, Matthew,
even you can't defend--

09:07.240 --> 09:08.474
(sighs)

09:11.612 --> 09:12.779
When you get
a free moment,

09:12.813 --> 09:14.480
could you come
to my office, please?

09:14.515 --> 09:16.349
It's my personal

09:16.382 --> 09:17.618
and private time.

09:17.651 --> 09:19.419
This firm does not own me.

09:21.187 --> 09:22.455
Matthew, she seems to think

09:22.488 --> 09:24.591
the firm doesn't own her.

09:26.259 --> 09:28.795
When you get a free moment,
please.

09:32.098 --> 09:33.934
BILLINGS: Were you dancing
in some bar last night?

09:35.301 --> 09:36.537
Without wardrobe?

09:42.976 --> 09:44.177
QUINN: Well, here's the thing,

09:44.210 --> 09:45.679
insurance companies
don't like to pay out

09:45.712 --> 09:47.380
when it's spouse
against spouse,

09:47.413 --> 09:48.582
especially
when it's what they call

09:48.615 --> 09:49.683
a supervening act,

09:49.716 --> 09:51.918
which an intentional biting
would be.

09:51.952 --> 09:54.721
Get him to bump you
accidental-like with the car,

09:54.755 --> 09:56.590
preferably when
he's backing up.

09:56.623 --> 09:58.291
I got a doctor
who can get you the X-rays.

09:58.324 --> 09:59.560
Manny, a second?

10:05.005 --> 10:07.140
Please, don't counsel
my clients.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.408
I had legal schooling, Jimmy.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.342
You're not a lawyer.

10:09.375 --> 10:11.812
Oh, excuse me.

10:11.845 --> 10:12.879
Listen,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.548
I talked to my friend
at the bureau.

10:14.581 --> 10:15.816
Your ass wasn't bugged.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.383
What did you expect
that they were gonna tell you--

10:17.417 --> 10:20.053
Manny, please don't talk
for a second, okay?

10:20.086 --> 10:21.755
They got what they got on you

10:21.788 --> 10:24.290
through an informant.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.226
He wouldn't tell me
who the informant was,

10:26.259 --> 10:28.328
but, uh, did you know

10:28.361 --> 10:30.163
Gigi got arrested
three weeks ago?

10:30.631 --> 10:31.532
My Gigi?

10:31.998 --> 10:33.199
D.U.I.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.435
They found some pot
in the glove compartment,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.337
enough to get her on intent.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.404
She never told me this.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.740
The bust went nowhere.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.074
The case was tossed.

10:42.943 --> 10:45.211
I think it's possible
she flipped you, Manny.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.547
Gigi?

10:48.048 --> 10:50.884
This isn't a possible thing,
Jimmy.

10:50.917 --> 10:51.885
She's my fiancee.

10:51.918 --> 10:53.253
She loves me.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.657
She even thinks I'm handsome.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.024
I'd like to talk to her.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.893
It wasn't Gigi.

10:59.926 --> 11:01.434
Manny,

11:01.467 --> 11:02.969
this is your business.

11:03.003 --> 11:05.071
I'm not gonna do nothing
you don't want me to,

11:05.105 --> 11:06.807
but I'm concerned.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.041
If this is the woman

11:08.074 --> 11:09.009
you're gonna marry.

11:09.042 --> 11:10.944
And if she flipped you--

11:12.746 --> 11:14.881
can I have a conversation
with her?

11:15.549 --> 11:17.918
Fine, but you're wrong.

11:17.951 --> 11:19.620
I hope to God I am.

11:21.321 --> 11:23.256
Look, Manny,

11:23.289 --> 11:25.792
if you want to get
to the truth of this or not,

11:25.826 --> 11:26.693
your call.

11:27.393 --> 11:29.129
But if you do,

11:29.162 --> 11:30.797
don't tip her.

11:30.831 --> 11:32.465
Just let me talk to her.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.400
I won't say nothing.

11:37.437 --> 11:38.639
It was an assault.

11:38.672 --> 11:39.673
The fact that it took place

11:39.706 --> 11:40.941
during a professional
hockey game

11:40.974 --> 11:42.709
doesn't mean this guy--
ROSE: Oh, come on, Jeffrey.

11:42.743 --> 11:45.145
You have 4,000 reported assaults
every year.

11:45.178 --> 11:46.613
Less than half lead to charges.

11:46.647 --> 11:48.248
Hannah, if you were still here,

11:48.281 --> 11:49.049
you'd prosecute.

11:49.082 --> 11:50.250
I certainly would not.

11:50.283 --> 11:52.786
He repeatedly punched
a defenseless man.

11:52.819 --> 11:54.588
He doesn't get
some special exemption

11:54.621 --> 11:56.389
because he did it
during a sporting event.

11:56.422 --> 11:57.457
That's just simply not true.

11:57.490 --> 11:59.492
We grant such exemptions
all the time.

11:59.526 --> 12:01.568
Excuse me a minute.
New guy--

12:01.602 --> 12:02.603
It would be illegal

12:02.636 --> 12:04.671
to run somebody down
and flatten them,

12:04.705 --> 12:06.172
yet in football.

12:06.206 --> 12:08.542
Boxers try to knock
each other unconscious.

12:08.575 --> 12:11.211
The actual intent
of the sport is assault.

12:11.244 --> 12:13.547
Imagine throwing a hard object

12:13.580 --> 12:15.616
a hundred miles per hour
at somebody's head.

12:15.649 --> 12:17.050
That's grounds
for attempted murder,

12:17.083 --> 12:19.285
but if the victim
crowds the plate--

12:19.319 --> 12:21.955
fighting is part of hockey.

12:21.988 --> 12:23.957
May I speak for a second?

12:24.958 --> 12:25.926
You are speaking.

12:25.959 --> 12:27.460
SHORE: Oh.

12:27.828 --> 12:30.564
Sometimes I become so rapt
with my own words,

12:30.597 --> 12:32.065
it feels more like a...

12:32.098 --> 12:33.634
listening experience.

12:34.701 --> 12:36.803
Look, we're gathered here today

12:36.837 --> 12:38.104
because of the media.

12:38.138 --> 12:40.406
I suspect,
if the firestorm died down,

12:40.440 --> 12:42.142
so would your urge
to be Javert.

12:42.776 --> 12:45.512
Suppose this man were severely
punished by the league.

12:45.546 --> 12:48.281
How about we get
our justice that way?

12:48.314 --> 12:50.216
First of all, I'm not the
commissioner of the league.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.852
I'm offering you
the chance to be.

12:51.885 --> 12:53.520
Name your punishment.

12:53.554 --> 12:54.487
Name it.

12:55.255 --> 12:56.356
Out of the playoffs

12:56.389 --> 12:57.524
and the next two years.

12:57.558 --> 12:58.391
Done.

12:58.424 --> 13:00.133
Done?

13:00.166 --> 13:01.134
How are you--

13:01.167 --> 13:01.935
I'll meet
with the commissioner.

13:01.968 --> 13:03.169
My client will be suspended

13:03.203 --> 13:05.305
for two full seasons
plus playoffs.

13:06.573 --> 13:07.841
I hate to break your momentum,

13:07.874 --> 13:09.375
but the players' union
will never let--

13:09.409 --> 13:10.476
Yes, they will.

13:10.944 --> 13:11.712
Because you say so?

13:11.745 --> 13:13.379
Because I say so.

13:13.413 --> 13:15.649
Congratulations,
Mr. District Attorney,

13:15.682 --> 13:18.084
you've just helped to change
hockey for the better.

13:18.118 --> 13:18.852
By the way,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.086
I may need to invoke

13:20.120 --> 13:21.522
the power of your office
a little.

13:21.555 --> 13:22.488
Not to worry.

13:29.596 --> 13:32.098
FRUTT: It doesn't necessarily
mean he's leaving.

13:32.132 --> 13:33.600
STRINGER: Oh, my God.
Jamie.

13:33.634 --> 13:35.468
Even if he's thinking
about leaving, Ellenor.

13:35.502 --> 13:37.437
This place will collapse.

13:37.470 --> 13:38.872
My job,

13:38.905 --> 13:39.906
my outfits--

13:39.940 --> 13:41.241
Could you please calm down?

13:41.274 --> 13:43.376
He's going on
a few interviews.

13:43.844 --> 13:46.112
It's a long shot
that he'll even be selected,

13:46.146 --> 13:46.880
so let's not get--

13:46.913 --> 13:48.815
Whoa, who are you kidding?

13:48.849 --> 13:49.783
He's black.

13:50.951 --> 13:52.719
So?
So,

13:52.753 --> 13:55.522
Romney is desperate
to appoint black judges.

13:55.556 --> 13:58.258
YOUNG: Is that it?

13:58.291 --> 13:59.993
They want me
because I'm black?

14:01.334 --> 14:03.704
No! No. No, no, no.

14:06.139 --> 14:07.874
Check that.

14:07.908 --> 14:09.543
Yes, in part.

14:11.211 --> 14:12.445
I mean, he's never
going to appoint

14:12.478 --> 14:13.814
an unqualified candidate.

14:13.847 --> 14:15.248
You're definitely qualified,

14:15.281 --> 14:16.817
so you can get off that horse.

14:17.317 --> 14:18.752
But...

14:18.785 --> 14:20.286
all things being equal,

14:20.320 --> 14:22.689
he will tap a black candidate.

14:22.723 --> 14:24.658
Diversity is a big part
of his executive order.

14:24.691 --> 14:26.059
I've read it.

14:26.092 --> 14:27.561
So if you go for this,

14:27.594 --> 14:28.895
you'll probably get it,

14:28.929 --> 14:30.163
which...

14:33.199 --> 14:34.367
is great.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.868
Let me start by saying...

15:03.937 --> 15:06.740
I believe in you, Sally.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.008
If I seem to be judgmental,

15:08.041 --> 15:10.811
it's only because I measure
your performance

15:10.844 --> 15:12.278
against your potential.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.115
When you meet new people,

15:15.148 --> 15:16.216
I would imagine the question

15:16.249 --> 15:17.951
"What do you do?"
pops almost immediately

15:17.984 --> 15:19.285
into the conversation.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.823
You answer, "I'm an attorney
at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt."

15:24.490 --> 15:26.527
When others describe you,

15:26.560 --> 15:28.729
"smart girl, nice,

15:28.762 --> 15:30.597
works at Crane,
Poole, and Schmidt."

15:32.198 --> 15:34.200
As much as you might like
to lay claim

15:34.234 --> 15:36.069
to your personal time

15:36.102 --> 15:38.038
or private life,

15:38.071 --> 15:40.340
who you are and where you work

15:40.373 --> 15:43.076
are inextricably bound, Sally.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.579
And when you're standing

15:45.612 --> 15:47.413
in a public bar,

15:47.447 --> 15:49.082
on the bar,

15:49.115 --> 15:50.851
half-naked,

15:50.884 --> 15:52.118
thrusting your great divide

15:52.152 --> 15:54.721
as if it were
a tourist attraction,

15:54.755 --> 15:56.623
there are people saying,

15:56.657 --> 15:58.224
"She's a lawyer

15:58.258 --> 16:00.100
at Crane, Poole,
and Schmidt."

16:01.635 --> 16:02.435
Now, as fine

16:02.468 --> 16:05.105
as your legal skills might be,

16:05.138 --> 16:07.007
we simply cannot have
our associates

16:07.040 --> 16:09.342
engage in public, drunken,

16:09.375 --> 16:11.244
pornographic conduct.

16:11.978 --> 16:13.747
And if you can't be concerned

16:13.780 --> 16:16.449
with our firm's reputation,

16:16.482 --> 16:17.951
I should think you'd at least

16:17.984 --> 16:20.587
try to show a little respect

16:20.621 --> 16:21.788
for your own.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.294
That's all.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.644
PESCATORE: What do you mean
he's practicing law?

16:43.677 --> 16:45.111
It says "law offices"
on the door.

16:45.145 --> 16:46.947
And inside I see law books

16:46.980 --> 16:48.982
and people going in and out,
limping and stuff.

16:49.015 --> 16:50.584
Right on commercial street?

16:50.617 --> 16:52.118
Commercial street
is what I'm saying.

16:52.152 --> 16:53.587
And you're sure
his name is Berluti?

16:53.620 --> 16:55.488
That's what it says
on the door,

16:55.522 --> 16:57.423
"Law offices of."

16:58.559 --> 17:00.667
law books inside,
people limping.

17:06.138 --> 17:07.339
MR. BURKE:
There is no precedent

17:07.373 --> 17:09.209
for a 2-year suspension.

17:09.242 --> 17:11.211
And even if
I were to sanction that,

17:11.243 --> 17:13.378
I can assure you,
the players' union wouldn't.

17:13.413 --> 17:15.248
If you only knew--
SHORE: What would they do,

17:15.281 --> 17:17.684
pull your jersey over your head
and pummel you?

17:17.718 --> 17:19.051
MR. BURKE: Mr. Shore,
the idea of--

17:19.085 --> 17:20.020
SHORE: Mr. Burke,

17:20.053 --> 17:23.156
you will suspend
Mr. Sears for two years.

17:23.189 --> 17:24.925
In consideration for that--

17:24.958 --> 17:26.560
forgive me, I'm parched.

17:30.731 --> 17:32.633
In consideration for that,

17:32.666 --> 17:34.267
I've worked it out with the D. A.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.268
for the league

17:35.301 --> 17:37.037
not to be criminally
prosecuted.

17:37.871 --> 17:39.072
MR. BURKE: The league?

17:39.105 --> 17:40.607
How are we liable
for the act--

17:40.641 --> 17:41.842
Massachusetts General Laws,

17:41.875 --> 17:43.944
chapter 274, section 2,

17:43.977 --> 17:45.045
Aiding and Abetting.

17:45.078 --> 17:47.113
Anyone who assists, encourages,

17:47.147 --> 17:47.981
or promotes an assault

17:48.014 --> 17:49.850
can be charged as a principal.

17:49.883 --> 17:50.684
We don't do that.

17:50.717 --> 17:51.852
You don't do that?

17:51.885 --> 17:52.953
No, we don't.

17:52.986 --> 17:54.755
In your highlight videos,

17:54.788 --> 17:55.956
you show the brawls.

17:55.989 --> 17:58.792
You also show them
on the big jumbotrons

17:58.825 --> 17:59.726
between periods.

17:59.760 --> 18:01.434
A Gordie Howe hat trick

18:01.467 --> 18:02.903
is considered to be a goal,

18:02.936 --> 18:04.370
an assist, and a fight.

18:04.404 --> 18:05.506
We penalize fighting.

18:05.539 --> 18:06.840
But you don't ban it.

18:07.574 --> 18:09.643
Every other professional
sport does.

18:09.676 --> 18:11.912
If a player fights
in football or baseball,

18:11.945 --> 18:12.879
he's gone.

18:12.913 --> 18:13.914
In your sport,

18:13.947 --> 18:15.248
he gets a standing ovation.

18:15.281 --> 18:16.550
MR. BURKE: Mr. Shore,

18:16.583 --> 18:18.852
I'm sure you're a fine attorney,

18:18.885 --> 18:21.354
but you have no appreciation
for what hockey is.

18:21.387 --> 18:23.590
Its history--
I have enormous appreciation

18:23.624 --> 18:24.958
for your sport, Mr. Burke.

18:24.991 --> 18:26.560
In fact, I have season tickets.

18:26.593 --> 18:28.228
Hockey is Bobby Orr.

18:28.261 --> 18:29.630
Hockey is Bobby Hull,

18:29.663 --> 18:31.698
Stan Mikita, Wayne Gretzky.

18:31.732 --> 18:33.499
Hockey is speed,

18:33.534 --> 18:35.569
finesse, skill,

18:35.602 --> 18:36.770
and power.

18:36.803 --> 18:38.338
None of which has anything

18:38.371 --> 18:40.273
to do with mayhem.

18:40.306 --> 18:42.275
Hockey is being debased

18:42.308 --> 18:43.610
with thuggery

18:43.644 --> 18:44.578
that your league

18:44.611 --> 18:46.680
not only condones

18:46.713 --> 18:48.081
but encourages.

18:48.114 --> 18:50.817
And you think,
if we just change the rule,

18:50.851 --> 18:51.985
it will stop.

18:52.018 --> 18:52.853
Yes.

18:52.886 --> 18:54.588
In college hockey,
it's banned.

18:54.621 --> 18:55.622
The players don't fight.

18:55.656 --> 18:56.857
In the Olympics,
it's banned.

18:56.890 --> 18:57.924
They don't fight.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.026
It can absolutely
be legislated out.

19:00.060 --> 19:01.702
You choose not to do so.

19:01.735 --> 19:03.236
And with all
the vicious muggings

19:03.269 --> 19:04.605
happening on the ice today,

19:04.638 --> 19:06.807
you are daring
a district attorney

19:06.840 --> 19:08.074
to prosecute the league.

19:08.108 --> 19:11.477
I have that district attorney,
Mr. Burke.

19:12.045 --> 19:13.246
Mr. Sears

19:13.279 --> 19:14.915
will be suspended

19:14.948 --> 19:16.416
for two years.

19:16.449 --> 19:18.118
You need to have appreciation

19:18.151 --> 19:20.353
for your sport, Mr. Burke.

19:20.386 --> 19:23.156
We need your league to rise up,

19:23.189 --> 19:24.658
and mirror the dignity

19:24.691 --> 19:26.693
of the game itself.

19:26.727 --> 19:28.328
Tell your players,

19:28.361 --> 19:29.730
"no more fighting."

19:31.197 --> 19:33.734
And if they still insist
on violence,

19:33.767 --> 19:35.201
let them beat up their coaches

19:35.235 --> 19:36.837
like the basketball players.

19:38.805 --> 19:39.973
(door opens)

19:40.006 --> 19:41.074
How are we doing?

19:43.744 --> 19:45.045
Fine.

19:45.746 --> 19:47.514
Have you made up
your mind yet?

19:48.248 --> 19:49.850
Made up my mind?

19:49.883 --> 19:51.518
I've barely had time
to think about it.

19:52.953 --> 19:53.654
Never mind.

19:54.888 --> 19:56.723
Uh, is there some rush?

19:59.225 --> 20:01.301
Well, this affects everybody,
Eugene.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.503
I realize that.

20:02.536 --> 20:03.804
FRUTT: So if you're going
to walk out on us,

20:03.837 --> 20:04.938
we'd just like--
Walk out?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.207
I didn't mean it like that.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.575
I think you did.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.311
You don't have to use that tone,
all right?

20:11.344 --> 20:12.345
You're the one
speaking in a tone

20:12.378 --> 20:13.714
like you're being betrayed!

20:17.283 --> 20:18.719
Put it out there, Ellenor.

20:19.653 --> 20:21.054
We've known each other too long.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.226
Put it out there.

20:27.127 --> 20:28.161
Okay.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.598
Bobby left, Lindsay,

20:31.632 --> 20:33.466
Rebecca,

20:33.499 --> 20:34.768
but you and I

20:34.801 --> 20:36.136
looked each other in the eye

20:36.169 --> 20:37.704
and we said

20:37.738 --> 20:40.006
we were going to make it work.

20:43.076 --> 20:44.310
If you leave...

20:46.513 --> 20:47.948
how can it work, Eugene?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.018
How can it work?

20:55.255 --> 20:57.257
Ellenor, look, uh,

20:58.692 --> 21:01.234
part of what's going on with me

21:01.267 --> 21:03.904
is this need to redeem myself.

21:03.937 --> 21:06.206
Redeem?
YOUNG: Yeah.

21:06.239 --> 21:07.908
In part,
for what the firm's become

21:07.941 --> 21:09.375
from dealing with Alan Shore,

21:09.409 --> 21:10.443
our reputation--
Hey, that's crap!

21:10.476 --> 21:11.645
Don't make this about that!

21:11.678 --> 21:12.846
If you want to leave--

21:12.879 --> 21:13.947
Do I get to talk?
FRUTT: Yes,

21:13.980 --> 21:15.115
but you asked me to be honest,

21:15.148 --> 21:16.550
so let's hear you put it out.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.118
Well, you're acting like
I don't have the right to leave,

21:18.151 --> 21:19.553
like I owe you--
FRUTT: I never said--

21:19.586 --> 21:20.921
I have the right.

21:23.156 --> 21:24.591
I gave everything to this firm!

21:24.625 --> 21:25.792
If I choose--

21:33.700 --> 21:35.802
I have the right.

21:39.205 --> 21:40.907
Yes, you have the right.

21:43.944 --> 21:47.247
But you know (sighs)

21:48.281 --> 21:50.083
you are this firm, Eugene.

21:50.116 --> 21:53.253
You're our conscience,
our soul.

21:56.990 --> 21:58.559
You are this firm.

21:58.592 --> 22:01.535
(music playing)

22:16.349 --> 22:18.451
BERLUTI: The reason I wanted
to have this conversation--

22:19.620 --> 22:21.855
well, some disturbing
information

22:21.888 --> 22:23.123
has come to light.

22:24.658 --> 22:26.793
You're acting creepy.

22:26.827 --> 22:29.495
You're both acting
kind of creepy.

22:29.530 --> 22:32.398
BERLUTI: Gigi,
my sources at the FBI

22:32.432 --> 22:34.668
tell me they were tipped off

22:34.701 --> 22:36.503
by an informant.

22:36.537 --> 22:38.605
Somebody with something
to trade.

22:39.673 --> 22:40.907
Well, who would turn
against Manny?

22:40.941 --> 22:42.308
I mean, everybody loves Manny.

22:45.311 --> 22:47.413
I'm also informed

22:47.447 --> 22:49.983
you were arrested
a few weeks ago,

22:50.016 --> 22:51.918
and that arrest
seemed to go away.

22:51.952 --> 22:52.686
What are you talking about?

22:52.719 --> 22:53.720
That's a lie.

23:00.967 --> 23:02.969
Here's a copy
of the incident report.

23:08.742 --> 23:11.277
Gigi, I will find out.

23:12.345 --> 23:13.980
A couple of motions in court,

23:14.014 --> 23:15.949
they got to tell me
who the informant is.

23:17.618 --> 23:19.886
Now, I know you love Manny.

23:21.287 --> 23:23.724
The best thing
that can happen here

23:23.757 --> 23:25.425
is I make out the argument

23:25.458 --> 23:26.527
that you were coerced,

23:26.560 --> 23:28.595
which I'm sure you had to be.

23:30.063 --> 23:32.766
I might be able
to make it all go away,

23:32.799 --> 23:34.067
but you got to tell me

23:34.100 --> 23:36.503
how you were coerced.

23:36.537 --> 23:39.472
(music playing)

23:58.024 --> 23:59.459
Jimmy?
Not now, Suzy.

23:59.492 --> 24:01.134
PAPONI: No,
you got to take this.

24:02.536 --> 24:03.870
Excuse me, please.

24:06.472 --> 24:08.074
Look, when I'm
in a serious meeting--

24:08.108 --> 24:09.843
PAPONI: This is Lenny Pescatore.

24:14.447 --> 24:15.516
We know each other.

24:16.783 --> 24:18.151
Old times, right, Jimmy?

24:19.686 --> 24:21.487
How can I help you?

24:21.522 --> 24:22.222
PESCATORE:
I don't know, Jimmy.

24:22.255 --> 24:23.356
See, I'm walking by,

24:23.389 --> 24:25.225
and I see a sign,
"Attorney at law,"

24:25.258 --> 24:26.560
so I come in,

24:26.593 --> 24:28.194
and I see you like
a neighborhood lawyer here,

24:28.228 --> 24:30.697
which, you know,
I'm a neighborhood lawyer, too.

24:31.231 --> 24:33.499
We could be buddies.

24:33.534 --> 24:34.801
Only problem...

24:37.070 --> 24:39.606
I'm the neighborhood lawyer,

24:39.640 --> 24:41.542
and this here
is my neighborhood...

24:44.377 --> 24:45.779
which I'm sure
you didn't know.

24:48.348 --> 24:49.783
But now you do know.

24:57.858 --> 24:59.492
What the hell was that?

24:59.526 --> 25:01.434
This Lenny Pescatore, Jimmy,

25:01.467 --> 25:03.236
he's not a nice person.

25:13.479 --> 25:15.516
I'll figure
this out, Manny.

25:15.549 --> 25:18.084
There's stuff
to work with here.

25:18.118 --> 25:19.620
I'll figure it all out.

25:36.637 --> 25:37.904
SHORE: Sally.

25:39.740 --> 25:40.440
Hello.

25:40.473 --> 25:41.407
Don't you start.

25:41.441 --> 25:43.510
I don't need another--
don't start.

25:43.544 --> 25:44.678
I never start.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.846
I'm more of a closer.

25:48.782 --> 25:49.783
What's wrong?

25:52.519 --> 25:53.620
Tell me.

25:54.555 --> 25:55.656
What's wrong?

25:55.689 --> 25:57.290
Let me tell you something.

25:57.323 --> 26:00.133
You probably wouldn't guess it
to look at me,

26:00.166 --> 26:01.768
but I made law review.

26:01.802 --> 26:04.237
I even won the regional
moot-court competition.

26:05.672 --> 26:06.673
You're right.
To look at you,

26:06.707 --> 26:07.774
I never would have guessed.

26:07.808 --> 26:10.577
Because people--

26:10.611 --> 26:12.378
people say, "Don't judge a book
by its cover,"

26:12.412 --> 26:15.081
but that's exactly
how I'm judged,

26:15.115 --> 26:18.051
even by people here
who know me, know my work.

26:18.084 --> 26:19.986
Well, perhaps people--
HEEP: I like to dress this way.

26:20.020 --> 26:21.722
I like to have fun

26:21.755 --> 26:22.856
on my personal time.

26:22.889 --> 26:24.691
Why can't people like you deal?

26:26.827 --> 26:28.729
First of all,
I can deal.

26:31.898 --> 26:33.634
I thought
you were absolutely

26:33.667 --> 26:35.769
sensational up
on that bar.

26:38.939 --> 26:39.673
Really?

26:39.706 --> 26:40.874
SHORE: Second, lawyers,

26:40.907 --> 26:43.476
as a breed,
hate their job, Sally.

26:43.510 --> 26:45.178
They do their very best

26:45.211 --> 26:46.647
to window-dress
the awfulness,

26:46.680 --> 26:48.314
big houses, fancy cars,

26:48.348 --> 26:49.816
expensive clothes.

26:49.850 --> 26:52.418
Attorneys actually want
to be judged by their covers.

26:52.452 --> 26:53.654
It makes them
seem interesting.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.189
Third,

26:56.222 --> 26:59.059
I thought
you were absolutely

26:59.092 --> 27:01.467
sensational up on that bar.

27:03.236 --> 27:04.905
You said that already.

27:05.506 --> 27:06.773
Fourth,

27:08.542 --> 27:10.777
to the extent
that you don't want

27:10.811 --> 27:12.779
to become them,

27:14.180 --> 27:15.448
I salute you.

27:18.051 --> 27:20.687
Don't ever,

27:20.721 --> 27:23.089
ever become...

27:23.123 --> 27:23.957
them.

27:27.027 --> 27:27.928
Lastly,

27:27.961 --> 27:30.463
and I'll stop here,

27:30.496 --> 27:33.066
I thought
you were absolutely

27:33.099 --> 27:35.736
sensational up
on that bar.

27:44.077 --> 27:45.045
Well, that was surprising.

27:45.078 --> 27:46.880
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.

27:46.913 --> 27:48.381
I don't know
why I just did that.

27:48.414 --> 27:49.683
I'm so sorry.

28:00.534 --> 28:02.235
ROSE: Hey, new guy.

28:02.268 --> 28:04.671
League issued
the suspension--two years.

28:04.705 --> 28:06.239
D.A. agreed not to prosecute.

28:06.272 --> 28:07.741
Client's coming in at 11:00.

28:07.774 --> 28:09.209
Good result.

28:09.242 --> 28:10.544
I'll buy you a beer later
and critique

28:10.577 --> 28:11.778
what I think you did wrong.

28:11.812 --> 28:13.647
I don't accept criticism,
Hannah,

28:13.680 --> 28:15.649
though I do enjoy
harsh discipline.

28:17.383 --> 28:18.752
May I speak with you?

28:18.785 --> 28:20.186
It's extremely important.

28:25.191 --> 28:26.259
Okay, I'm, like,
really nervous,

28:26.292 --> 28:27.393
so I'm just gonna say this

28:27.427 --> 28:29.495
before I get
all acid reflux and gurgle.

28:29.530 --> 28:31.632
I have no idea
why I kissed you.

28:31.665 --> 28:33.499
I mean,
I think you're cute,

28:33.534 --> 28:35.501
but, um, I just
don't go around

28:35.536 --> 28:37.003
tongue-throating
cute guys.

28:37.037 --> 28:39.706
I just--what you said

28:39.740 --> 28:41.241
suddenly made me
want to kiss you.

28:41.274 --> 28:43.544
That doesn't explain
why I did it, but...

28:43.577 --> 28:45.579
Sally, it's okay.

28:45.612 --> 28:46.513
Really?

28:46.547 --> 28:47.714
Don't worry about it.

28:47.748 --> 28:48.882
Thank you.

28:51.618 --> 28:53.353
Um,

28:53.386 --> 28:55.355
when you say it's okay,

28:56.957 --> 28:58.391
how okay?

28:58.424 --> 28:59.860
I beg your pardon?

28:59.893 --> 29:02.302
Well, I do sort of think
you're attractive.

29:04.170 --> 29:06.406
God, I promised myself
I wouldn't go there.

29:06.439 --> 29:07.741
Um...
Sally,

29:07.774 --> 29:10.777
I think you're
a very attractive woman,

29:10.811 --> 29:12.613
but...

29:12.646 --> 29:15.315
I'm involved.

29:16.983 --> 29:18.519
Oh. Okay.

29:20.286 --> 29:22.455
Okay.

29:22.488 --> 29:23.557
Anyone I know?

29:23.590 --> 29:25.659
Myself, actually,

29:25.692 --> 29:28.361
and it's quite serious.

29:28.394 --> 29:30.964
I'm not in the right place

29:30.997 --> 29:32.533
for a relationship.

29:36.703 --> 29:37.904
Okay. (sighs)

29:43.243 --> 29:45.612
So, I'm gonna leave now.

29:49.049 --> 29:50.050
Bye.

29:53.353 --> 29:54.420
(door closes)

29:55.822 --> 29:57.658
If I flip my dealer, Jimmy,

29:57.691 --> 29:58.992
I'm a dead man.

29:59.025 --> 30:00.534
Not that I care.

30:00.567 --> 30:03.203
BERLUTI: I'll see
if we can do it confidential.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.838
It's our only shot, Manny.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.573
For them to let you go,

30:06.607 --> 30:08.408
you got to give them
somebody bigger.

30:08.441 --> 30:10.043
Fine. Whatever.

30:11.077 --> 30:12.278
Hey, look at me.

30:14.114 --> 30:15.716
Your heart is broken
right now.

30:15.749 --> 30:17.651
I understand this.

30:17.684 --> 30:18.952
But better you learn about her

30:18.985 --> 30:21.287
before you get married, right?

30:21.321 --> 30:22.823
Obviously,

30:22.856 --> 30:24.691
this wasn't the right person
for you.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.995
It ain't easy to get girls
to love me, Jimmy.

30:29.029 --> 30:30.864
I'm fat. I got no money.

30:30.897 --> 30:32.298
Women don't go for me.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.201
Jimmy?

30:35.235 --> 30:36.770
Not now, Suzy.

30:36.803 --> 30:38.071
He's back,
Lenny the fish.

30:40.907 --> 30:42.108
BERLUTI: One second.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.215
Jimmy, my friend.

30:49.249 --> 30:51.317
I asked you to stay
out of my office.

30:51.351 --> 30:52.753
Relax.

30:52.786 --> 30:54.855
I only came by to say
Ralph Spinaci

30:54.888 --> 30:56.990
will no longer be needing
your services.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.593
He died.

31:00.667 --> 31:02.836
Oh, Spinny?

31:02.869 --> 31:03.770
When?

31:04.470 --> 31:05.706
In a few days.

31:10.611 --> 31:12.879
You're not gonna
intimidate me.

31:12.913 --> 31:14.214
You got that?

31:14.247 --> 31:16.617
I'm here, and I'm here to stay.

31:17.684 --> 31:19.419
You got a lot of balls,

31:19.452 --> 31:20.954
you know that?

31:20.987 --> 31:23.256
I been working
this neighborhood for years

31:23.289 --> 31:25.291
while you were sipping
Dom Perignon

31:25.325 --> 31:27.493
up on the hill
with the medagons.

31:27.528 --> 31:28.795
Now you want to come back

31:28.829 --> 31:30.897
and take food off my plate.

31:30.931 --> 31:33.433
Doesn't look like
you've missed too many meals.

31:36.136 --> 31:37.738
Yeah, I like your style.

31:38.572 --> 31:40.541
You got good gumption.

31:42.475 --> 31:44.511
I like a man with gumption.

31:44.978 --> 31:47.013
But I don't like it that much!

31:47.047 --> 31:48.615
Get out of my office,
you hear me?

31:48.649 --> 31:50.651
Hey!
I grew up in this neighborhood!

31:50.684 --> 31:52.753
Get out now
before I call the police!

31:52.786 --> 31:54.788
PESCATORE: Go ahead,
call the cops!

31:54.821 --> 31:56.156
Ask for Frankie Lupo,

31:56.189 --> 31:57.490
ask for Steve Freschetti,

31:57.524 --> 31:59.325
Mike Luciano, good cops.

31:59.359 --> 32:01.134
I'm sure
they'll come running.

32:01.702 --> 32:04.571
QUINN: He asked you
to get out.

32:04.605 --> 32:06.873
Manny,

32:06.907 --> 32:09.576
you got new counsel,
huh, Manny?

32:09.610 --> 32:11.678
Manny owes me money.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.213
FBI still bugging your ass,

32:13.246 --> 32:14.815
Manny?

32:14.848 --> 32:16.550
Jimmy asked you to leave.

32:17.651 --> 32:19.786
Oh, you want a piece of me, huh?

32:19.820 --> 32:21.287
Go ahead.
See what happens.

32:21.321 --> 32:23.023
There's no cops around
to break it up.

32:23.056 --> 32:24.791
Take a shot.
See what happens.

32:24.825 --> 32:26.292
All right--
QUINN: Shut up, Jimmy.

32:26.326 --> 32:27.694
It's a different league now.

32:29.763 --> 32:31.632
I'm standing right here, Lenny.

32:33.133 --> 32:34.367
Oh, yeah?

32:36.503 --> 32:38.204
For now, you're standing.

32:52.085 --> 32:53.353
I said I'd buy you a beer,

32:53.386 --> 32:54.621
so here.

32:56.790 --> 32:59.292
I believe you promised
to discipline me, as well.

33:05.205 --> 33:06.540
(sighs)

33:08.374 --> 33:09.375
Look,

33:09.409 --> 33:11.578
you're obviously a good lawyer,

33:11.612 --> 33:14.214
but I give you
a few weeks here, tops.

33:14.247 --> 33:15.582
You don't understand authority,

33:15.616 --> 33:16.583
you're arrogant.

33:16.617 --> 33:18.785
My suspicion
is you're corrupt

33:18.819 --> 33:20.621
and probably
unflinchingly selfish and--

33:20.654 --> 33:23.356
Foreplay like this
can only lead to sex.

33:27.628 --> 33:28.862
You're disgusting.

33:29.663 --> 33:31.064
You're quivering.

33:33.800 --> 33:35.001
I've read that women

33:35.035 --> 33:36.369
who like to emasculate

33:36.402 --> 33:38.338
secretly desire to be ravished.

33:39.706 --> 33:42.208
Would you like me to rip your
blouse off right now, Hannah?

33:43.544 --> 33:45.078
Put my mouth to your breast,

33:45.111 --> 33:47.180
and perhaps (inhales deeply)

33:47.213 --> 33:49.983
lower myself?

33:50.016 --> 33:51.317
You want to slap my face,

33:51.351 --> 33:53.419
but part of you fears
it could arouse me.

33:53.453 --> 33:55.956
And since you stand there

33:55.989 --> 33:56.790
already...

33:56.823 --> 33:59.025
titillated by me,

33:59.059 --> 33:59.960
it could set something

33:59.993 --> 34:01.835
terribly nasty in motion.

34:02.636 --> 34:05.105
I could be wrong, of course.

34:05.138 --> 34:07.140
Maybe we should see.

34:07.173 --> 34:08.609
Slap my face, Hannah.

34:10.043 --> 34:11.344
It's what you want.

34:13.446 --> 34:14.547
Slap it.

34:34.067 --> 34:35.068
Another second?

34:42.976 --> 34:43.944
I'm sorry.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.014
After all we've been through,

34:50.717 --> 34:52.686
as much as I love this firm,

34:55.255 --> 34:57.991
it would be an honor

34:58.024 --> 34:59.092
to see a lawyer from here

34:59.125 --> 35:00.734
get appointed to the bench.

35:02.168 --> 35:03.203
(sighs)

35:03.236 --> 35:05.772
I would be so proud of you,

35:06.873 --> 35:08.341
proud for all of us.

35:12.112 --> 35:14.180
Is there a timetable?

35:14.948 --> 35:16.683
Well,

35:16.717 --> 35:19.119
if I decide to go forward,

35:19.152 --> 35:20.887
there would be
a confirmation hearing

35:20.921 --> 35:22.789
before the governor's counsel
next week.

35:24.090 --> 35:24.891
(sighs)

35:24.925 --> 35:27.093
You might even be called

35:27.127 --> 35:28.662
to give testimony.

35:31.364 --> 35:32.599
Well,

35:32.633 --> 35:34.400
just let me know.

35:37.671 --> 35:38.672
Okay.

35:43.476 --> 35:46.412
(door opens and closes)

35:49.215 --> 35:50.817
Well?

35:50.851 --> 35:52.152
It's happening, Jamie.

35:53.053 --> 35:53.954
He's doing it?

35:53.987 --> 35:55.355
FRUTT: He says he's undecided,

35:55.388 --> 35:57.090
but I know him.

35:57.123 --> 35:58.258
It's happening.

36:10.443 --> 36:12.546
Oh, great.

36:12.579 --> 36:14.247
Go away.

36:15.081 --> 36:16.416
I just got here.

36:16.449 --> 36:17.951
Look, I'm embarrassed
enough already.

36:17.984 --> 36:19.653
You don't have
to show up here

36:19.686 --> 36:20.887
and massage my feelings.

36:20.921 --> 36:21.988
I'm a big girl.

36:22.022 --> 36:24.658
SHORE: I love having
my feelings massaged.

36:24.691 --> 36:26.660
Go away and give
some other nice guy

36:26.693 --> 36:27.961
a chance to sit there.

36:28.862 --> 36:31.665
Sally, you don't need
to feel embarrassed.

36:31.698 --> 36:32.398
Look,

36:32.432 --> 36:34.400
I kissed you.

36:34.434 --> 36:36.402
It was totally inappropriate.

36:36.436 --> 36:37.904
Then I made a play for you.

36:37.938 --> 36:39.706
And by the way,
I know that you hit on everyone,

36:39.740 --> 36:41.675
so what was I even thinking
about to begin with?

36:41.708 --> 36:43.443
But then to be rejected

36:43.476 --> 36:45.712
by someone who's obviously
not picky--

36:46.847 --> 36:48.615
just go away.

36:53.820 --> 36:54.921
Look at me.

36:59.259 --> 37:00.767
You know how two people

37:00.800 --> 37:02.001
can sometimes seem

37:02.035 --> 37:04.170
to make each other
more whole?

37:07.140 --> 37:08.842
That doesn't happen with me.

37:11.344 --> 37:15.081
I have this way
of making women feel...

37:15.114 --> 37:16.583
wonderful,

37:16.616 --> 37:19.252
but less than,

37:19.285 --> 37:20.954
in the end.

37:22.455 --> 37:24.290
Maybe you haven't met
the right girl.

37:26.660 --> 37:27.761
Perhaps.

37:34.635 --> 37:36.637
I'll tell you what,
I would like to dance with you.

37:38.004 --> 37:39.606
You're massaging again.
Go away.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.341
On the contrary,

37:41.374 --> 37:43.309
it's my own ego at play now.

37:43.343 --> 37:45.045
I'm currently
being seen by others,

37:45.078 --> 37:46.346
talking to a pretty woman.

37:46.379 --> 37:48.615
If I simply walk away,

37:48.649 --> 37:50.551
it'll look like
I've been rejected.

37:50.584 --> 37:53.253
I'd appreciate
you allowing me to save face.

37:55.589 --> 37:56.757
One dance.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.935
Don't mess with me.

38:08.509 --> 38:09.543
One dance.

38:12.412 --> 38:15.348
(music playing)

38:18.218 --> 38:20.153
If you mess me up,
I'll totally hit you.

38:20.186 --> 38:21.387
I understand.

38:23.557 --> 38:25.191
I don't know what you're doing
but I don't sleep with guys

38:25.225 --> 38:26.960
right off,
if that's what you're after.

38:26.993 --> 38:29.796

my respect, I assure you.
