01:31.258 --> 01:33.158
Remember when
you were a little kid

01:33.160 --> 01:36.095
and some adult told you
to enjoy being young,

01:37.264 --> 01:39.331
because you'll
grow up really fast

01:40.334 --> 01:42.201
and be old before you know it?

01:43.270 --> 01:45.170
You didn't believe
them, did you?

01:46.841 --> 01:50.709
But then one day, you
wake up in a panic

01:50.711 --> 01:52.144
and realize they were right.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.890
Elon Musk says we're all
living in a simulation

02:37.892 --> 02:40.893
designed by an
advanced civilization,

02:43.330 --> 02:44.796
some alien race out there

02:44.798 --> 02:47.232
using our misery
for entertainment,

02:48.869 --> 02:53.906
conspiring against us, just
to watch us struggle and fail.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.613
Are we all just a bunch
of ones and zeroes?

04:21.362 --> 04:22.995
Kyle, I know these guys.

04:22.997 --> 04:24.496
They're high-end, they're local,

04:24.498 --> 04:26.565
and it is cheaper to
buy it by the case.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.667
It's too expensive.

04:28.669 --> 04:29.768
I'll take three.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.936
I'm not saving enough.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.341
Bobby, are you okay?

04:36.343 --> 04:37.576
Yeah.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.278
I live not too far.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.514
3:59, Bob, cutting it close.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.317
Well, thank you,
I am really excited

04:45.319 --> 04:46.918
to get you those three bottles.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.053
I'll see you soon.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.788
You're lookin' good today.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.056
Love that suit.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.324
Well, thanks.

04:54.428 --> 04:56.628
Bigshot Bobby,
happy birthday, bro.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.331
Don't remind me.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.567
Dude, how come you didn't
text me back last week?

05:02.569 --> 05:05.504
Hey, Bobby, I
wanna talk to you.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.039
Just a little heads up,

05:07.041 --> 05:10.008
the house is gonna be taking
50% now of our pooled tips.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.977
You can't do that.

05:11.979 --> 05:12.978
Just did.

05:12.980 --> 05:13.912
You said for
the winter months.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.480
Yeah, I know what I said.

05:15.482 --> 05:16.415
Yeah.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.816
Well, Kyle, it's springtime.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.551
That's the way
it is, boys, okay.

05:19.553 --> 05:21.920
You should be grateful
that you have a job.

05:21.922 --> 05:22.821
I would be.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.490
Grateful.

05:25.492 --> 05:26.858
Great, you guys are great.

05:33.067 --> 05:34.933
He's getting harder
and harder to ignore.

05:34.935 --> 05:38.036
Exactly why I hit you up,
but you didn't text me back.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.539
Hey, Carlos, Kyle said we're
using the other olive oil

05:40.541 --> 05:42.040
for the entrees now.

05:42.042 --> 05:42.974
What do you mean?

05:42.976 --> 05:43.709
That's not olive oil, man.

05:43.711 --> 05:44.943
It's a blend.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.011
I know, but the
real stuff is gone.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.379
Kyle.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.752
Authentic
Italian cuisine,

05:53.754 --> 05:54.619
right here in Phoenix.

05:54.621 --> 05:55.554
- Hey, Tanya.
- Hey.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.621
Back for more fun?

05:56.623 --> 05:57.823
Right.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.992
Let's see, Hearts
Creed over ice.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.962
Ooh, I'll have a
thoughtful bartender.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.864
Kyle and these goddamn
pour restrictors.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.566
I can't even pour
a decent drink.

06:07.568 --> 06:08.934
Such a douche.

06:08.936 --> 06:11.069
You know he's ordering
single bottles now?

06:11.071 --> 06:12.838
I know, I told him.

06:14.141 --> 06:16.141
This place is doomed.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.009
Maybe I'll join you.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.380
Locally
owned and operated.

06:21.382 --> 06:23.014
So I hope it's
not hurting your accounts.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.749
Nah, it's all right.

06:24.751 --> 06:26.485
I'm not gonna be
slingin' booze forever.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.886
How long you been
dealing with him?

06:27.888 --> 06:28.720
Five years.

06:28.722 --> 06:29.554
Jesus.

06:29.556 --> 06:31.089
Yeah.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.023
Cheers, dude.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.630
Mm.

06:40.134 --> 06:41.066
Oh.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.467
Like candy.

06:42.469 --> 06:43.735
It is so good.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.936
You know, I use
this for grilling.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.104
Put it on cauliflower.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.073
Little red onion,
little salt and pepper.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.409
And then I make this really
amazing Cajun cream sauce.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.143
It's so yummy.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.577
Mm, that sounds ridiculous.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.812
It is ridiculous.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.013
Well, I don't really
cook like I used to.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.648
My place isn't
really set up for it.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.916
No?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.017
- No, it's...
- Well, you have place, so.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.685
I do, but it's small.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.921
Yeah, my place
is pretty small.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.123
I mean, it's a three-bedroom.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.758
It's on a beautiful
piece of property, but.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.427
You're on a gorgeous
piece of property.

07:08.429 --> 07:10.495
I was there for your
birthday last November.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.631
That's right, you were there.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.533
It was a very nice night.

07:14.535 --> 07:15.534
Hey, hey.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.736
Hi.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.870
Oh, Mario, Bobby.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.938
- My man.
- Hey.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.039
Pleasure.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.174
Look at that 'stache.

07:22.176 --> 07:22.974
That is a good 'stache.

07:22.976 --> 07:23.942
Isn't that great?

07:24.978 --> 07:25.911
- Here you go.
- Oh, no, no.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.546
Tanya and I are old friends.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.181
It's all right,
keep it anyway.

07:29.183 --> 07:33.118
And bring us a really
nice rose, Bobby.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.053
Will do, coming right up.

07:35.055 --> 07:35.854
Shall we?

07:35.856 --> 07:36.788
I like it.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.859
Right
here in Phoenix.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.595
Thank you.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.464
Now, see, I like
this guy, Bobby.

07:45.466 --> 07:48.166
Most people in this world,
they're all smoke, no fire.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.468
But not this guy.

07:49.470 --> 07:50.502
I can see it.

07:50.504 --> 07:51.570
I can feel your heat, my man.

07:51.572 --> 07:53.238
You're burning me up.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.574
Or is that Tanya?

07:55.576 --> 07:57.242
Yeah, that's you.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.778
Doesn't she look resplendent?

07:59.780 --> 08:01.179
Like a goddamn sunrise.

08:01.181 --> 08:02.581
- Thank you.
- You keep that up,

08:02.583 --> 08:03.782
I'm gonna have to
put these on in here.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.018
Investor.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.753
It's all good news, baby.

08:08.755 --> 08:09.921
Si, soy Mario.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.257
Where'd you find him?

08:13.060 --> 08:15.527
He's a venture capitalist.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.896
So you're mixing
business with pleasure?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.799
Very tricky, like
vodka and Red Bull.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.834
That's disgusting, and no.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.836
I mean, you know, maybe.

08:24.838 --> 08:25.770
But I don't know.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.672
It's not, I mean, I could.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.956
- I'd have to...
- You're just makin' up

08:28.958 --> 08:30.241
- as you go along.
- Just gonna figure it out.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.543
Forgive me.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.177
How's Bobby's rose?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.111
It's so good.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.880
It's dry, it's fruit-forward.

08:34.881 --> 08:35.947
It's got citrus notes.

08:35.948 --> 08:37.115
It's not too sweet.

08:37.116 --> 08:38.783
All right, let's see.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.018
Mm.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.054
Yeah, strawberry,
notes of citrus.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.223
I mean, you have a
beautiful palate, Tanya.

08:45.225 --> 08:47.592
Can I get you started
on any appetizers?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.061
You give us a minute, please?

09:34.775 --> 09:38.843
Hey!

09:38.845 --> 09:39.844
Later, Bobby.

10:01.668 --> 10:04.836
My life really
does feel like a farce

10:04.838 --> 10:05.937
written by aliens.

10:08.909 --> 10:09.908
Like these fish.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.812
A waitress I went out
with a couple of times

10:13.814 --> 10:16.281
was moving away, and she
asked me to adopt them.

10:17.751 --> 10:19.150
I told her I'd think about it.

10:21.355 --> 10:22.787
And then the next
thing you know,

10:22.789 --> 10:24.389
she brings 'em over
and sets up the tank.

11:00.927 --> 11:01.760
What you doin', man?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.228
Hi, man.

11:03.230 --> 11:04.963
You ready for this?

11:04.965 --> 11:08.266
Dark roast, extra cream and
sugar, the way you like it.

11:08.268 --> 11:09.734
Thanks, man.

11:11.905 --> 11:12.871
So what's been going on, bro.

11:12.873 --> 11:15.006
How's the comic book going?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.007
It's a graphic novel.

11:17.044 --> 11:17.942
Is it done?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.445
It's languishing unfinished.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.080
Oh, man.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.315
I thought when you moved into
your sweet mama's trailer

11:24.317 --> 11:26.851
you said you'd be able to focus.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.219
Thought by now
you'd makin' bank,

11:28.221 --> 11:30.355
signing autographs
at the Comic-Con,

11:30.357 --> 11:33.124
royalties from alien figurines.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.895
Hey, Bobby, I'm sorry.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.129
This is good.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.931
This is exactly what
I'm trying to get to.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.833
You don't have time
to write or draw

11:41.835 --> 11:44.302
because you're wasting your
nights workin' your ass off

11:44.304 --> 11:46.071
at Kyle's terrible restaurant.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.806
But here's the thing, man.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.207
It wouldn't matter if I
had a different situation,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.342
'cause everything's
predetermined.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.811
No, no, no.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.379
Don't you be blaming
the aliens again, bro.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.147
My mom used to say.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.318
Everyone creates
their own destiny.

12:02.723 --> 12:03.855
Do me a favor, Bobby.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.824
Close your eyes for a minute.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.058
Come on, just do it.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.461
Close your eyes.

12:09.463 --> 12:10.895
Good.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.065
Now, deep breath.

12:14.067 --> 12:17.869
And I want you to
go deep, way down.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.472
You feel that?

12:21.942 --> 12:24.809
Your passion is
still there, Bobby.

12:24.811 --> 12:28.880
I can feel it squirming
beneath all those failures,

12:28.882 --> 12:29.948
all those regrets.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.850
This is supposed
to help me, right?

12:31.852 --> 12:32.884
Yeah.

12:32.886 --> 12:34.853
Come on, close your eyes.

12:34.855 --> 12:35.920
Do it.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.122
Okay.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.224
I want you to visualize
what you'll be doing

12:39.226 --> 12:40.525
10 years from now.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.095
Can you see it?

12:44.097 --> 12:45.530
Not working for Kyle at least.

12:45.532 --> 12:46.998
No.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.767
What would your
mama want for you?

12:48.769 --> 12:50.502
You were her beneficiary.

12:50.504 --> 12:52.937
She left you that crib,
that beautiful Airstream,

12:52.939 --> 12:55.940
and she left you a nice
little chunk of change.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.145
Oh, is that what
this is about?

13:00.147 --> 13:01.880
Yeah, I mean, what would
your mom want you to do

13:01.882 --> 13:03.782
with those 50 Gs that
you're just sitting on?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.383
I mean, it was supposed
to be for Nikki and mean,

13:05.385 --> 13:09.521
and then for my mom's
hypothetical grandchildren.

13:09.523 --> 13:10.989
No, fuck that, bro.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.857
Nikki's gone, life goes on.

13:12.859 --> 13:15.059
That's your nest egg now.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.561
Mom wanted you to be happy.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.364
I thought about livin'
off that money, you know,

13:19.366 --> 13:21.399
rollin' along with it.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.067
But I can't just burn
through all that cash

13:23.069 --> 13:24.936
and have nothing to show for it.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.071
I can respect that.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.473
But think about this.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.943
Why not use that cash to
create a new life for yourself?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.380
I mean, that's what I'm doing.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.948
I've been saving my money.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.388
Woo.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.289
Yeah.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.858
Look at this.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.092
Are you serious?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.228
You kidding me?

13:51.298 --> 13:53.164
It's like the castle
of our dreams.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.900
Can you see it?

13:55.902 --> 13:59.404
Neon bowling ball,
neon pins falling down.

14:00.907 --> 14:02.841
What do you think?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.008
I think you've lost your mind.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.010
No, you're not
visualizing it, Bobby.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.145
What do you remember
about this place?

14:07.147 --> 14:08.012
Bowling.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.114
Okay, yeah, what else?

14:10.116 --> 14:11.950
Come on, man, close your eyes.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.084
You're not visualizing.

14:13.086 --> 14:13.952
Just do it.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.022
Okay, what do you remember?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.090
Birthday parties.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.593
Good, yes, bein' a kid.

14:21.595 --> 14:23.895
Running free, eating cake.

14:23.897 --> 14:26.431
Playing "Donkey Kong"
with your stupid buddies.

14:26.433 --> 14:27.999
What else do you remember?

14:34.574 --> 14:39.143
Drivin' around with Nikki in
her mom's yellow '87 Camaro.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.197
I don't know.

14:43.199 --> 14:44.315
Come on,
close your eyes.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.116
I'm not closin'
my eyes anymore.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.050
I feel like an idiot.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.285
Okay, all right, all right.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.586
We'll see how this
makes you feel.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.155
Huh?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.424
Bowling 300 in your senior
year, you remember that?

14:53.426 --> 14:57.295
Before it was Bigshot
Bobby, he was 300 Hoffy.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.529
Shit, I had just moved here.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.131
I couldn't even speak English.

15:00.133 --> 15:03.101
But my best friend is the
high school bowling champ.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.168
Kind of raised my stock.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.673
Come on, I'll show you
what really gets me goin'.

15:10.010 --> 15:10.942
And no more about
Nikki, bro, okay.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.076
This is now.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.682
Oh, wow.

15:17.684 --> 15:18.950
Yeah.

15:18.952 --> 15:20.485
Now I see what
you're talking about.

15:20.487 --> 15:21.986
It's beautiful.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.121
All right, just hear me out.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.956
No, this is perfect.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.291
It could be.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.359
You see, Bobby, by
keeping this place closed,

15:28.361 --> 15:30.194
we're depriving all
the children of Phoenix

15:30.196 --> 15:32.030
of all those sweet
memories you were talkin'.

15:32.032 --> 15:33.464
Wouldn't wanna deprive
'em of this place.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.933
You fix up the bar here.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.501
Your choices, anything you like.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.003
Oregon craft beer, Oregon wines.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.271
You're a tastemaker, Bobby.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.706
You always have been.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.975
Keep your mind open.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.576
I'm gonna show you
my sanctum sanctorum

15:45.578 --> 15:48.146
and exactly why this
enterprise is gonna work.

15:50.016 --> 15:50.982
Check this out.

15:50.984 --> 15:52.650
This is it, baby.

15:52.652 --> 15:55.186
This is where the
magic happens, huh.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.688
Beautiful or what?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.022
Don't worry, everything in here

15:58.024 --> 15:59.357
will be cleaned and restored.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.161
Greasy chicken strips.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.029
French fries, milkshakes.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.098
Ranch dressing, mm.

16:07.100 --> 16:10.001
You know me better than that.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.135
Okay, check this out.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.704
Napoletano pizza pies

16:12.706 --> 16:14.572
that compete with the
best in the world,

16:14.574 --> 16:17.342
all the dough made fresh
daily with these hands.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.384
I think it's a dump.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.053
Oh, that's it, you could roll.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.588
I remember.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.490
It's a completely
useless talent.

16:32.492 --> 16:35.026
Yeah, well, that useless
talent is gonna save this place

16:35.028 --> 16:36.194
from becoming a Dollar Store.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.428
Look at this.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.030
Rising Phoenix.

16:39.032 --> 16:41.399
Come for the pizza,
stay for the bowling.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.035
Or come for the bowling,
stay for the pizzas.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.603
Oh, but you haven't
tasted my pies.

16:45.605 --> 16:46.704
But you will, bro.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.605
You'll see.

16:53.046 --> 16:54.178
Oh!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.780
See, that's a sign.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.149
Your aliens made you
throw that strike.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.218
How come you didn't tell
me about this place earlier?

17:00.220 --> 17:02.420
I didn't wanna
jinx it, you know.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.654
I'm saving my cash.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.056
Come on, I wanna show
you somethin' else.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.695
Play room.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.698
It's your office.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.699
Where's your office?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.200
Kitchen's my office.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.636
But this is yours.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.605
Come on, eat and bowl for free.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.442
You need a day off, take one,
because you'd be an owner.

17:24.444 --> 17:25.777
Man, think about it.

17:28.348 --> 17:32.216
Well, I have to admit, it
actually sounds kind of amazing.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.217
But then I think,

17:33.219 --> 17:37.155
this has gotta be the stupidest
fuckin' idea you ever had.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.623
All right.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.290
Well, you know what should
really freak you out?

17:39.292 --> 17:40.725
Getting old.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.794
Not going after your dreams
when you had a chance.

17:42.796 --> 17:47.131
Watching your life slip
away, and then you die.

17:47.133 --> 17:47.832
Oof.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.102
Okay, well, let's
keep it positive.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.437
Imagine being an owner,

17:52.439 --> 17:55.139
drawing your comics
whenever you want.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.275
No more Kyle, bro.

17:57.277 --> 17:58.409
No more bow ties.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.488
Damn it.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.498
Hey,
so tomorrow night,

18:20.500 --> 18:22.433
I got my first
investor meeting, man.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.768
You coming?

18:23.770 --> 18:25.570
I don't know, Carlos.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.740
I mean, I'd really
like nothing more

18:29.742 --> 18:32.276
than the say fuck you to Kyle.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.211
Yes.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.112
Hey.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.114
Hey, Bobby.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.332
Hey.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.784
Do you have something
you wanna say to me?

18:41.287 --> 18:42.220
No.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.121
No?

18:44.157 --> 18:45.556
Nope.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.258
Oh, I thought you...

18:47.260 --> 18:51.162
I was just talking to
Carlos about your new oil.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.396
The new oil?

18:52.398 --> 18:54.165
New oil, well, what
about it, Carlos?

18:54.167 --> 18:55.233
We can't use it anymore.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.501
It's a compromise
I'm not okay with.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.469
But we're already using it.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.303
But Kyle...

18:59.305 --> 19:02.340
But Kyle.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.608
It affects the taste, man.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.177
It affects the
taste.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.545
Look, an oil blend
might save money...

19:07.547 --> 19:09.096
Oh, it saves money.

19:09.098 --> 19:10.648
But it's like pouring
hot water in your latte.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.351
I think you're
totally overreacting.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.520
Blade made me today's special
with the new olive oil.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.354
It was delicious.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.488
It's not an olive oil.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.789
Quit calling it that.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.725
It's a blend that fucks
with the taste, all right!

19:20.727 --> 19:22.727
I love
when Carlos gets mad.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.630
His eyes pop out
like my pet iguana.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.765
Goddamn it, Bobby,
where's your bow tie?

19:30.570 --> 19:31.736
I guess I forgot it.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.237
Oh, I forgot it, Kyle.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.438
Yeah, sorry, Kyle.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.607
All right.

19:36.609 --> 19:37.508
Okay.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.877
You stay right there.

19:48.821 --> 19:49.654
It's your lucky day.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.821
Here you go.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.256
You're gonna pay for this.

19:52.258 --> 19:55.293
15 bucks comes outta
the top of your tips.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.761
Seems a little high.

19:56.763 --> 19:57.762
It's almost cost.

19:58.932 --> 20:00.698
What do you say?

20:00.700 --> 20:01.766
Thank you, Kyle.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.634
Thank you, Kyle.

20:03.636 --> 20:04.869
Thank you, Kyle.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.506
Thank you, Kyle.

20:08.508 --> 20:09.774
There it is.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.309
That was nice.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.210
Okay.

20:13.746 --> 20:14.812
You're welcome.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.664
Man, I almost threw
my apron in his face

20:33.666 --> 20:34.732
and bailed tonight, bro.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.670
18 bucks on a Saturday night.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.239
Disgrace.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.307
It's time, my friend.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.976
Look, I know
tomorrow's our day off,

20:44.978 --> 20:46.510
but why don't you just drop by.

20:46.512 --> 20:47.945
Come check it out.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.714
I mean, we're goin' up
to my nephew Rudy's place

20:49.716 --> 20:50.681
up at the lake.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.416
He's got this great kitchen.

20:52.418 --> 20:55.653
We'll talk some business, eat
some pies, drink some wine.

20:55.655 --> 20:56.520
Come on.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.723
I'll be there.

21:00.693 --> 21:02.760
That's it, baby.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.028
Okay, I'll text you the address.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.730
Seven o'clock, don't forget.

21:05.732 --> 21:06.731
Woo!

21:22.815 --> 21:24.882
I met Nikki
at Christmas mass.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.054
I saw her at the top
of the cathedral steps.

21:31.724 --> 21:35.926
I went to public high school,
and she was a St. Mary's girl.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.495
Things moved fast.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.098
The dough is most
critical, right.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.670
100-year yeast starter,
double fermentation.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.773
Carlos, I thought we were
gonna talk a little business.

22:55.775 --> 22:56.741
We are, Bobby.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.376
That's exactly what we're doing.

22:58.378 --> 23:03.414
Now, my tomato sauce is
slow-cooked and full-bodied.

23:04.751 --> 23:05.616
It comes from the meaty
and juicy heirloom tomatoes

23:05.618 --> 23:07.752
grown in San Marzano,

23:07.754 --> 23:10.888
ripening in the rich volcanic
soil of Mount Vesuvius.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.124
Oh, I love that deep red color.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.892
Look at that.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.527
Yes.

23:16.529 --> 23:18.062
Rich.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.465
A great tomato sauce has zest.

23:21.467 --> 23:23.901
I love that word
because it means energy.

23:23.903 --> 23:25.870
Fresh crushed
peppers and garlic,

23:25.872 --> 23:28.406
Sicilian oregano,
cracked peppercorn,

23:28.408 --> 23:31.575
and just enough sea salt
to lock in the taste

23:31.577 --> 23:35.012
so it stays zesty and delicious.

23:35.014 --> 23:39.750
Fresh roasted garlic,
Parmigiano-Reggiano.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.919
House-cured pancetta.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.555
Now this goes into a hot oven.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.795
Wild arugula.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.798
I call this this one the
Elisa, after my mother.

23:57.637 --> 23:59.503
Because it's a thing
of great beauty.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.573
En paz descansa.

24:15.888 --> 24:16.987
Mm.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.029
Get out your dictionary.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.131
Look up holy fuck.

24:30.970 --> 24:31.869
Oh, man.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.510
So are Rudy and Marie investing?

25:13.746 --> 25:15.813
No, but I think
they could advise us.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.015
They've done really well
with their two taquerias,

25:18.017 --> 25:19.717
and they're thinking of
opening a third location.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.186
So I think they'd
be down to help us.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.588
Thought about askin' my
dad to be a third investor,

25:24.590 --> 25:25.956
but nah, I don't
wanna risk his money.

25:25.958 --> 25:29.994
I mean, he's but picking on
the farms for over 40 years.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.262
Plus, you know, I
don't want anybody

25:31.264 --> 25:32.997
lookin' over my shoulder
second-guessing.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.865
I wanna be left
alone with the menu.

25:36.269 --> 25:38.035
So who's the third investor?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.703
Mario Bentley Jr.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.839
He's this new venture
capitalist in town.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.875
Hmm.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.176
That guy, yeah, he's
the guy that was dancin'

25:46.178 --> 25:48.112
with Tanya the
other night, right?

25:48.114 --> 25:49.847
Yeah, did you meet him?

25:50.850 --> 25:51.815
Yeah, I met him.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.285
What?

25:54.287 --> 25:56.854
He's kind of a
one-percenter, isn't he?

25:56.856 --> 25:59.123
He's been really successful.

25:59.125 --> 26:02.826
Carlos, I don't want
another Kyle tellin' me

26:02.828 --> 26:04.795
I gotta wear a bow tie.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.897
Mario's hands-off, bro.

26:06.899 --> 26:07.798
He's not like that.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.033
He's a great guy.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.100
The only reason
he's even in town

26:10.102 --> 26:11.602
is for this cannabis thing.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.104
He's usually flyin' around
the world somewhere.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.839
So I think he's goin' to Dubai.

26:15.841 --> 26:17.875
He's gonna be gone
for a few months.

26:17.877 --> 26:18.809
Why isn't he here now?

26:18.811 --> 26:20.010
Because I didn't invite him.

26:20.012 --> 26:21.845
Because this is about
you and me, Bobby.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.180
That's it.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.648
Look, I'm in.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.116
I already signed the lease.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.885
I didn't wanna take a chance
on losing the property,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.219
so once Mario said he was in,

26:29.221 --> 26:31.689
I just went ahead and
secured it myself.

26:32.825 --> 26:34.158
What if I don't invest?

26:34.160 --> 26:38.162
Well, then I have
to find a new partner.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.230
But that's not something
that I can control.

26:40.232 --> 26:43.634
This place, it's
my destiny, Bobby.

26:43.636 --> 26:44.602
I know it is.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.038
I'm excited about
this angel investor,

26:48.040 --> 26:50.140
but you're the guy
that I've always wanted

26:50.142 --> 26:51.976
to be my everyday
business partner.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.349
I wasn't convinced,

26:58.351 --> 27:00.918
until I tasted those
pies of yours, man.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.857
I'm in.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.192
Serious?

27:08.194 --> 27:11.261
Oh, my brother.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.798
That's what I'm talkin' about.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.784
Ooh!

27:17.786 --> 27:19.670
You remember that touchdown
celebration dance, dude,

27:19.672 --> 27:22.106
when you got the
300, and yeah, baby.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.208
Yeah!

27:51.804 --> 27:53.237
Mario Bentley Jr.

28:08.054 --> 28:10.220
It's gonna be good.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.389
With
red wine and rosemary.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.124
Finished with roasted garlic.

28:14.126 --> 28:15.259
You think I wouldn't notice

28:15.261 --> 28:16.927
an expensive bottle going empty?

28:16.929 --> 28:18.328
How stupid do you think I am?

28:18.330 --> 28:20.731
Well, I think
you're pretty stupid.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.232
You're fired!

28:22.234 --> 28:24.334
You can't fire me.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.769
I quit!

28:25.771 --> 28:26.704
You can't quit
after being fired.

28:26.706 --> 28:27.337
That doesn't make any sense.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.338
You're stupid.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.406
I'm stupid?

28:29.408 --> 28:30.240
Hey!

28:30.242 --> 28:31.075
Bobby, Bobby, be cool.

28:31.077 --> 28:32.209
He ain't worth it.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.080
If you even touched, I
mean, brushed against my coat,

28:36.082 --> 28:38.148
I would have you up
on assault charges.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.817
You know what, Carlos,
you're also fired.

28:39.819 --> 28:42.052
My resignation's
already on your desk.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.469
Yeah, but I didn't see it.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.887
So technically, I fired
you before you quit.

28:44.890 --> 28:47.324
Whatever, as long as I don't
have to cook here anymore.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.859
Blade, good timing.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.095
You are the new
interim head chef.

28:51.097 --> 28:52.262
Wait, what's going on?

28:52.264 --> 28:53.897
These two geniuses
are opening up

28:53.899 --> 28:55.799
a pizza parlor/bowling alley.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.137
What else are you gonna
be selling, live bait?

29:00.139 --> 29:01.071
Lotto tickets?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.140
You gonna put in a gas pump?

29:03.142 --> 29:05.943
Maybe some video poker machines?

29:05.945 --> 29:06.910
That's classy.

29:06.912 --> 29:11.115
Come with us, I'll show you
how to cook some real food.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.217
I don't know, Carlos.

29:13.219 --> 29:14.485
Being the head chef is a
pretty good opportunity

29:14.487 --> 29:15.319
for me, man.

29:15.321 --> 29:16.220
Damn right, it is.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.190
Come on,
Bobby, let's go.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.391
Hey.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.826
Let me give you a warning.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.762
This is a fucking hard business.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.830
You can't trust anybody.

29:26.832 --> 29:27.931
I learned that.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.334
That was smart.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.016
Hey!

29:46.018 --> 29:48.318
Hey, oh, there she
is, the deal-maker.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.220
Oh, my god, you're in?

29:50.222 --> 29:51.355
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm done with Kyle.

29:51.357 --> 29:52.322
I'm done with Kyle.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.257
Congratulations.

29:53.259 --> 29:54.191
Yeah, it's kind of amazing

29:54.193 --> 29:55.459
how this is all coming together.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.360
Yeah.

29:58.063 --> 29:58.996
Are you goin' over there?

29:58.998 --> 29:59.530
- Yeah.
- Of course.

29:59.532 --> 30:00.798
Yeah.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.466
So how much cash
does Mario have?

30:02.468 --> 30:04.301
Oh, he's swimming in cash.

30:04.303 --> 30:06.537
This pot deal is
serious, trust me.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.205
Right.

30:08.207 --> 30:10.040
So are you goin' out with him?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.143
No. Why?

30:13.145 --> 30:14.244
Well, I mean, I just
thought, you know,

30:14.246 --> 30:17.181
since we're gonna be partners,

30:17.183 --> 30:19.249
I just thought I should know.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.520
Well, I dig him, but
I mean, it's nothing.

30:23.522 --> 30:24.955
I mean, he's a player.

30:24.957 --> 30:26.290
But that's what makes
him kind of fun, so.

30:26.292 --> 30:27.224
Sure.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.458
Are you jealous?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.194
No, no.

30:30.196 --> 30:31.295
Yeah, totally, actually.

30:32.431 --> 30:33.964
He's a pretty intimidating guy.

30:33.966 --> 30:38.068
Maybe I should learn
how to salsa dance, or.

30:38.070 --> 30:39.403
Yeah, well, maybe you should.

30:39.405 --> 30:41.572
You should probably get a
few new moves in there now.

30:42.474 --> 30:43.941
Bowling alley owner.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.843
Yeah.

30:45.845 --> 30:46.877
All right.

30:59.058 --> 31:00.123
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:06.932 --> 31:09.132
Woo, that's what I'm
talkin' about, baby.

31:09.134 --> 31:10.500
Makin' money just makes me want

31:10.502 --> 31:13.036
- to move my body.
- Oh.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.504
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.340
And ya brought the boys.

31:16.342 --> 31:18.075
Carlos, my man, how are you?

31:18.077 --> 31:19.109
- Bobby.
- Good to see you, sir.

31:19.111 --> 31:20.043
Yeah.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.478
Guys, I'm sure you're wonderin',

31:21.480 --> 31:22.880
thank you very much,

31:22.882 --> 31:24.314
what the hell I'm doin'
in Southern Oregon.

31:24.316 --> 31:26.083
I came here to get
my hands around

31:26.085 --> 31:28.118
that billion dollar
weed industry, right.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.388
And now that that's done,
our little venture here,

31:31.390 --> 31:33.090
it's mostly for fun.

31:33.092 --> 31:36.226
But I gotta say, man, we
are diggin' your concept.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.095
Great, 'cause
we, the concept is,

31:38.097 --> 31:39.329
you know, we, that...

31:39.331 --> 31:41.565
Beer and bowling
go hand in hand.

31:41.567 --> 31:43.567
Alcohol by itself,
now that's a business.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.469
But you throw in
these delicious pies

31:45.471 --> 31:47.905
and the fact that
Carlos's world-class dough

31:47.907 --> 31:50.107
only costs pennies
to make, come on.

31:50.109 --> 31:53.911
This is not steak and seafood,
right, this is mom and pop.

31:53.913 --> 31:55.545
The markup on a pizza,
baby, that's where it's at.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.047
Oh, you know,

31:57.049 --> 31:59.082
- I love your enthusiasm, sir.
- Oh, yeah.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.685
And thank you, Mario, for
your willingness to back us.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.086
Up until this point,

32:03.088 --> 32:04.254
I've been finding this
thing willy-nilly,

32:04.256 --> 32:05.455
as you like to say.

32:05.457 --> 32:08.058
But now we have
official paperwork.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.293
Speaking of.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.160
- All right, gentlemen.
- Here it is.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.495
Here we go.

32:18.203 --> 32:19.603
Congratulations.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.307
All right, cheers.

32:23.309 --> 32:24.942
Congratulations, guys.

32:24.944 --> 32:25.642
Woo!

32:25.644 --> 32:27.377
To Mario, thank you.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.360
You got this, Hoffy.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.564
Where's Mario?

32:47.566 --> 32:49.032
Oh, he's on with Tokyo again.

32:49.034 --> 32:50.300
But he's wiring
his money anyway.

32:54.707 --> 32:55.539
Thank you, sir.

32:55.541 --> 32:57.074
Here's my balance.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.142
Money already spent
in QuickBooks.

33:58.771 --> 33:59.803
Hey, guys.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.476
Dream team's here!

34:06.478 --> 34:07.544
We got this.

35:04.169 --> 35:05.535
Is it fixable?

35:05.537 --> 35:08.171
Classic Brunswick A2
pinsetter made back in the '60s.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.439
Good machine.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.608
Just needs a little TLC.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.477
Well, that's great news.

35:13.479 --> 35:15.679
So Carlos and I were wondering,

35:15.681 --> 35:17.747
since they're probably all
gonna need a little work,

35:17.749 --> 35:19.783
could you give us a
break on the price?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.352
Nah.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.790
Well, can you
give us an estimate?

35:26.792 --> 35:28.225
Not really.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.860
I mean, who knows
what I'll run into.

35:29.862 --> 35:31.595
Could you just
give us a ballpark?

35:31.597 --> 35:32.696
With these old pinsetters

35:32.698 --> 35:35.298
and all the lane work
this place needs,

35:36.435 --> 35:37.767
10 grand, minimum.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.336
10 grand?

35:39.338 --> 35:41.771
Well, we don't have to
do everything at once.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.540
Nah, we don't
need smooth lanes

35:43.542 --> 35:45.909
or machines that
actually reset the pins

35:45.911 --> 35:47.677
or return the fuckin' balls.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.780
Nah, don't need 'em.

35:50.782 --> 35:53.783
Bowlers can just, like,
retrieve their own balls

35:53.785 --> 35:55.285
after each roll.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.289
Motherfuckin' shit.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.594
I know it's a
lot of money, but...

36:04.596 --> 36:05.762
It's not in the budget, man.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.797
Well, here's the thing.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.766
The lanes...

36:09.768 --> 36:10.934
I'm talkin' about the lanes.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.235
They left fine to me.

36:12.237 --> 36:13.203
Well, they're not fine.

36:13.205 --> 36:14.704
It's not even a question.

36:14.706 --> 36:17.574
They have to be repaired,
cleaned, and reconditioned.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.610
What if it's like every
lane has its own character,

36:20.612 --> 36:21.945
you know, like a
different challenge.

36:21.947 --> 36:24.281
Carlos, this isn't golf.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.751
Come on, man, this is
bowling, great American sport.

36:27.753 --> 36:31.655
It's available and
affordable to the 99%.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.559
You're
right, man, I'm sorry.

36:35.561 --> 36:36.860
- I'm freakin' out.
- No worries.

36:36.862 --> 36:37.794
I just want it to
be great, you know.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.728
It is gonna be great.

36:38.730 --> 36:39.896
I want it to be great, too.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.866
You know what, go
back to the kitchen.

36:42.868 --> 36:43.767
I'll...

36:45.304 --> 36:46.269
- Let me woo him.
- All right, thanks.

36:46.271 --> 36:47.337
- All right.
- Thanks, man.

36:51.743 --> 36:53.243
Hey, you're Hoffy.

36:55.981 --> 36:58.481
I saw your cute little
display on the wall.

36:58.483 --> 36:59.316
Oh.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.317
Yeah.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.551
I got 300 scores before,

37:01.553 --> 37:03.820
but nobody ever put my
pictures in the papers.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.957
Well, I was just a
kid at the time, so.

37:06.959 --> 37:09.259
When's the last time
you got a perfect score?

37:09.261 --> 37:11.962
That was the last time,
that one magic Saturday.

37:11.964 --> 37:13.330
Just a lucky day, huh?

37:13.332 --> 37:13.964
Whoop-de-do.

37:13.966 --> 37:15.498
Whoop-de-do, de-do.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.000
It wasn't a lucky day, Al.

37:17.002 --> 37:18.435
I was good.

37:18.437 --> 37:20.437
When I was a teenager,
I averaged over 200.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.638
Yeah, and what happened?

37:21.640 --> 37:22.572
You grew up and
you got all mental,

37:22.574 --> 37:24.007
couldn't bowl for shit anymore?

37:24.009 --> 37:26.443
No, I got interested
in other things, okay.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.677
I started drawing comics.

37:27.679 --> 37:28.945
I went to art school.

37:29.881 --> 37:33.283
Uh-huh.

37:34.519 --> 37:37.821
Since you're such
a hotshot bowler, Al,

37:37.823 --> 37:40.690
you should enter our
grand opening tournament

37:40.692 --> 37:41.925
and share your gift.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.727
You gonna put my
picture on the wall

37:43.729 --> 37:45.695
after I bury your ass?

37:47.466 --> 37:50.500
You know, I'm just tryin'
to make friendly conversation.

37:50.502 --> 37:52.435
Yeah, yeah, right,
friendly conversation.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.771
You're tryin' to get a discount.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.940
Al, if you
continue to be rude,

37:56.942 --> 37:59.009
I might have to
get somebody else.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.494
I am the boss.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.980
If you're gonna be
this rude, I'll walk.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.415
And then you'll have
to get someone else

38:05.417 --> 38:06.416
to do what I can do.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.651
And good luck doin' that.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.753
In this county,
I'm the only guy.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.527
Still want me around,
Bigshot Bobby?

38:18.797 --> 38:21.031
Yeah, I do, Al.

38:21.033 --> 38:24.801
That's what
I thought.

38:30.676 --> 38:32.008
So you
wanna just reach in.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.843
And then you punch.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.384
You drizzle it in the
side, and you rub the in.

38:51.663 --> 38:52.562
Yes.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.074
I'm gonna have to practice
if I'm gonna beat that clown.

39:04.076 --> 39:05.408
I'll bowl with you.

39:05.410 --> 39:06.042
You will?

39:06.044 --> 39:07.811
That's great, you bowl?

39:07.813 --> 39:09.045
Uh...

39:09.047 --> 39:09.979
No.

39:09.981 --> 39:11.114
Even better.

39:11.116 --> 39:13.116
This is a fresh hop from Eugene.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.017
Okay.

39:15.754 --> 39:16.653
Mm.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.022
That's really nice.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.557
- Yeah.
- No Budweiser?

39:20.559 --> 39:21.658
No way, not here.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.892
Wait 'til you taste these pies.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.127
They should pair
'em with Opus One.

39:24.129 --> 39:25.762
Well, you're gonna
price out your clientele.

39:25.764 --> 39:28.965
That's why I need a big-value
cab that's not obnoxious.

39:28.967 --> 39:32.702
I have a local cab
that will blow your mind.

39:32.704 --> 39:34.671
And it is 120 a case.

39:37.008 --> 39:37.907
Uh-oh.

39:41.046 --> 39:45.749
Bigshot Bob, this place
is worse off than I thought.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.820
So I'm gonna be bringin'
on my assistant Joe.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.456
Is that necessary?

39:54.626 --> 39:55.792
You want your
lanes respectable

39:55.794 --> 39:59.462
for your historic grand
opening tournament?

39:59.464 --> 40:00.130
Yeah, but...

40:00.132 --> 40:01.131
Okay then.

40:05.971 --> 40:07.737
You know, Al,

40:07.739 --> 40:10.440
I'd like to express a
little gratitude right now

40:11.676 --> 40:14.477
for giving me the opportunity
to light up your ass

40:14.479 --> 40:15.912
during this tournament.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.648
I'm gonna really
enjoy destroying you.

40:18.650 --> 40:19.849
Oh, shit.

40:22.053 --> 40:22.952
Whoa.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.424
So.

40:27.426 --> 40:28.691
So that's how it's gonna be?

40:31.663 --> 40:33.863
You haven't even
seen me roll, Hoffy.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.900
You haven't seen the
action on my ball.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.501
First-class Boomer.

40:39.671 --> 40:41.471
Nothin' but clean
games on my cards.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.506
I'm gonna fry your ass.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.608
I'm gonna send you
back to art school.

40:55.720 --> 40:56.586
I like him.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.730
This is
the buffalo pesto.

41:07.732 --> 41:08.832
Please, please, try it.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.066
All right.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.668
- Tanya, Blade.
- Thank you, sir.

41:11.670 --> 41:13.203
That's
the spicy Calabrese.

41:13.205 --> 41:14.637
Oh!

41:14.639 --> 41:15.839
Bon appetit.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.107
Mm.

41:18.109 --> 41:19.676
Blade,
por favor, take one.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.244
Oh, my god.

41:21.246 --> 41:22.078
What did I tell you?

41:22.080 --> 41:22.912
Yeah.

41:22.914 --> 41:23.947
It's amazing.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.014
Mm.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.649
- Mm.
- So good.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.484
- Huh?
- Oh.

41:27.486 --> 41:28.218
That's your dough.

41:28.220 --> 41:31.187
Hey, Mario, sorry, I'm eating.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.088
Okay.

41:34.759 --> 41:36.192
All right,
we got Bobby, Carlos?

41:36.194 --> 41:37.026
Hey.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.261
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.796
And also Blade,
our new prep cook.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.664
Hey, Blade, welcome.

41:41.666 --> 41:42.866
Yeah.

41:42.868 --> 41:43.933
Guys, listen,
I gotta tell you.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.835
Dubai, geez, this
place is beautiful.

41:45.837 --> 41:46.803
That's what money does.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.538
It simply empowers people

41:48.540 --> 41:51.941
to put absolutely beautiful
things out into the world,

41:51.943 --> 41:53.843
like your pies, Carlos.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.045
Yeah, we're taste-testing
them right now, as we speak.

41:56.047 --> 41:57.847
Oh, you tease.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.582
So delicious.

41:59.584 --> 42:00.116
All right, guys,
a little business here.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.518
All right.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.752
Grand opening, that's
fast approaching.

42:02.754 --> 42:03.753
How's everything looking?

42:03.755 --> 42:05.188
Amazing.

42:05.190 --> 42:06.890
I'm loving coming in
here at the crack of dawn

42:06.892 --> 42:08.525
just gettin' busy
in the kitchen.

42:08.527 --> 42:10.760
All right,
crack of dawn, wonderful.

42:11.730 --> 42:12.862
Bobby?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.097
It's goin' very good.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.132
Very good.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.936
We're coming out with
organic pilsners, local.

42:19.938 --> 42:22.171
We're branching out into, like,

42:22.173 --> 42:23.740
some soft drinks
for the children.

42:23.742 --> 42:25.208
Oh, there we go.

42:25.210 --> 42:26.743
That's what I'm talkin' about.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.244
Are you comin' to
the grad opening?

42:28.246 --> 42:29.078
Oh, come on.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.280
What are you, crazy?

42:30.282 --> 42:31.881
Jenny's already booked
the flights, man.

42:31.883 --> 42:33.616
And Hoffy, you're gonna bowl

42:33.618 --> 42:35.018
another 300 game my man

42:35.020 --> 42:36.686
I can feel it.

42:36.688 --> 42:39.556
I'll be jet-lagged, but I
will be in time for some pies.

42:39.558 --> 42:40.690
Look, much love,
guys, I gotta run.

42:40.692 --> 42:41.324
See you all soon.

42:41.326 --> 42:42.158
Take care.

42:42.160 --> 42:43.059
Bye-bye.

42:43.962 --> 42:46.896
Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo.

43:24.803 --> 43:27.003
Can't stop
thinkin' about my mom.

43:27.005 --> 43:29.839
She never had a real
wedding or a honeymoon.

43:31.977 --> 43:33.810
Our wedding and
reception was perfect.

43:33.812 --> 43:34.811
What can I say?

43:34.813 --> 43:37.180
The aliens wrote a great script.

43:40.051 --> 43:43.386
Is it normal for a man
to think about his mom

43:43.388 --> 43:44.721
on his honeymoon?

43:44.723 --> 43:45.855
Don't misunderstand.

43:45.857 --> 43:47.890
Nikki and I were
having a terrific time.

43:50.028 --> 43:54.697
After the luau, I was told
my mom's boyfriend called.

43:55.900 --> 43:56.966
I knew something happened,

43:56.968 --> 43:59.035
because this clown
would never call me.

44:01.239 --> 44:05.074
Four days into our honeymoon,
we were on our way back home.

44:07.178 --> 44:08.077
Margie.

44:10.849 --> 44:12.181
Mother.

44:12.183 --> 44:13.082
Mom.

44:14.719 --> 44:15.418
Mama.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.057
Mommy.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.834
Knock, knock.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.102
Hey.

44:33.104 --> 44:34.871
Hey, are we all buttoned
up on the first order

44:34.873 --> 44:35.938
so I can take it?

44:35.940 --> 44:37.173
Yeah, just like it is.

44:37.175 --> 44:38.741
Thanks, appreciate it.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.045
What you got there?

44:42.047 --> 44:45.148
Oh, just doodling, takin'
advantage of my office.

44:47.886 --> 44:48.918
Doodling?

44:48.920 --> 44:50.353
So self-indulgent.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.256
Is that you?

44:53.258 --> 44:54.724
Yeah.

44:54.726 --> 44:57.026
Apparently my storied
life deserves a book.

44:57.028 --> 44:57.894
- Can I?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

44:57.896 --> 44:59.028
You can touch it.

45:01.966 --> 45:02.865
Wow.

45:06.004 --> 45:07.303
These are amazing.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.940
These are really
fucking amazing.

45:10.942 --> 45:12.709
It must be so cathartic.

45:12.711 --> 45:16.279
I submitted 'em to Curly
Mullet Comics in Portland.

45:16.281 --> 45:17.847
I haven't heard back yet.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.015
It's a long shot.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.017
Well, maybe they
didn't get to it yet.

45:21.019 --> 45:22.752
Did you submit anywhere else?

45:24.355 --> 45:25.254
Why not?

45:28.760 --> 45:31.094
You're in here after hours.

45:31.096 --> 45:33.112
I'm you got a lot of stuff here.

45:33.114 --> 45:35.131
Well, that doesn't mean
it deserves to be published.

45:37.001 --> 45:37.900
Oh.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.203
I see.

45:40.205 --> 45:42.004
You have your wires crossed.

45:42.006 --> 45:43.940
It's just a work in progress.

45:44.943 --> 45:46.809
I don't even have an ending yet.

45:46.811 --> 45:48.077
I mean, you love doing this,

45:48.079 --> 45:50.980
so just stop complaining
about it and finish it.

45:50.982 --> 45:53.116
You have no idea what
I've been going through

45:53.118 --> 45:54.350
tryin' to finish this.

45:54.352 --> 45:55.351
But that's why you
need to finish it.

45:55.353 --> 45:57.386
Because people need to see this.

45:57.388 --> 45:59.088
Otherwise, it's not a book.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.323
It doesn't count.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.096
I don't mean to be harsh.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.331
It just seems like
you're in a funk.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.400
Is that your ex?

46:11.402 --> 46:12.335
Yeah.

46:12.337 --> 46:15.505
She is so gorgeous.

46:15.507 --> 46:17.907
She's hot, she's like,
and not like fake hot.

46:17.909 --> 46:22.044
She's like French cafe,
sort of nostalgic.

46:22.046 --> 46:25.848
Hey, do you wanna
go outside for just,

46:26.885 --> 46:28.117
out to the bar.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.018
Okay.

46:35.360 --> 46:37.527
Anyway, the plot sort of
turns on Nikki and my mother.

46:37.529 --> 46:41.164
But it's really all about
me, a memoir of sorts.

46:41.166 --> 46:43.900
I'm trying to be very realistic.

46:43.902 --> 46:46.068
And it is, except for the aliens

46:46.070 --> 46:48.070
that control the
simulation that I live in.

46:48.072 --> 46:50.072
And I know that sounds weird.

46:50.909 --> 46:51.507
Of course it does.

46:51.509 --> 46:52.575
It's so obvious, yeah.

46:52.577 --> 46:53.409
Oh, thank you.

46:53.411 --> 46:54.377
Yeah, you're welcome.

46:54.379 --> 46:56.179
So why did you get divorced.

46:56.181 --> 46:57.079
Well,

46:58.316 --> 47:02.885
we were in Oahu.

47:05.323 --> 47:07.890
I, well, we were on
our second honeymoon.

47:07.892 --> 47:11.160
And my husband went off

47:11.162 --> 47:13.296
with his high school
girlfriend.

47:13.298 --> 47:14.463
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah.

47:14.465 --> 47:16.098
You're kidding me?

47:16.100 --> 47:17.867
No, they'd been emailing,
and they just decided

47:17.869 --> 47:19.535
to go through with it.

47:19.537 --> 47:20.369
So.

47:20.371 --> 47:21.304
That's brutal.

47:21.306 --> 47:22.205
It was.

47:25.944 --> 47:27.009
Yeah, it was brutal.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.879
But I'm good, you know.

47:30.982 --> 47:32.415
I have fully adjusted
to being on my own.

47:32.417 --> 47:33.316
I've got no kids.

47:33.318 --> 47:34.550
I've got no attachments.

47:34.552 --> 47:35.918
And you know,

47:37.589 --> 47:40.223
I literally never have
to speak his name again.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.558
What's his name?

47:42.560 --> 47:44.093
Not saying.

47:44.095 --> 47:45.061
You're very quick.

47:47.232 --> 47:48.564
You're good, you're good.

47:48.566 --> 47:49.966
Well, I've never been happier.

47:49.968 --> 47:53.069
So it's all good.

47:53.071 --> 47:54.403
You're wearing it well.

48:04.148 --> 48:05.248
Hey, Al.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.950
I'm takin' off.

48:07.952 --> 48:09.601
If you don't mind,

48:09.603 --> 48:11.253
could you turn off the
lights and close up?

48:11.256 --> 48:12.922
Actually, Joe
and I were thinkin'

48:12.924 --> 48:15.491
of leavin' all the
fuckin' lights on, Hoffy,

48:16.561 --> 48:18.661
and leavin' all the
doors wide open.

48:20.131 --> 48:21.097
Is that all right?

48:40.251 --> 48:41.651
Do you need a cab?

48:43.688 --> 48:45.521
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

48:45.523 --> 48:46.422
Thanks.

48:46.424 --> 48:51.494
Yeah.

48:59.938 --> 49:01.570
I feel like I'm 14 again,

49:02.674 --> 49:05.174
drawing comics and
needing a ride home.

49:07.178 --> 49:10.046
Well, it's not
all bad being 14.

49:10.048 --> 49:11.948
I like the way you
devoured that pizza today.

49:11.950 --> 49:14.984
Jesus Christ.

49:14.986 --> 49:15.718
I don't know know
how that happens.

49:15.720 --> 49:18.020
Where does it go?

49:28.533 --> 49:29.732
It's the silver
Airstream on the right,

49:29.734 --> 49:31.634
just past this building.

49:31.636 --> 49:32.535
Okay.

49:33.371 --> 49:34.270
Wow.

49:35.974 --> 49:38.507
You were not kiddin'
when you said small.

49:38.509 --> 49:40.977
I used to live in
this big, old house

49:40.979 --> 49:42.044
on a 100-acre farm.

49:42.046 --> 49:44.113
And when the trim
season would come,

49:44.115 --> 49:47.016
all these vagabonds would
just take over the place.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.517
And there was a bungalows
on the property.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.587
It was really fun
for about a month.

49:53.124 --> 49:54.390
Yeah.

49:54.392 --> 49:55.992
So I took advantage
of my mom's Airstream,

49:55.994 --> 49:59.128
simplified, downsized.

50:00.031 --> 50:01.397
Yeah, I don't save anything.

50:03.034 --> 50:03.733
Since I've been on my own,

50:03.735 --> 50:05.434
it's like any junk that I have

50:05.436 --> 50:07.103
that I have a negative
attachment to it,

50:07.105 --> 50:10.339
send it to Goodwill, or
recycle it, or I don't know,

50:10.341 --> 50:13.109
throw it in a dumpster
and never look back.

50:13.111 --> 50:14.010
Feels good.

50:15.546 --> 50:16.512
You're so...

50:19.684 --> 50:21.217
Well, you're a lot of things.

50:22.754 --> 50:24.253
Thanks for the ride.

50:44.475 --> 50:48.310
After the funeral, mom's
aneurysm had me scared.

50:48.312 --> 50:51.781
So I took a kickboxing
class to get into shape.

50:51.783 --> 50:53.282
It helped vent my anger.

50:53.284 --> 50:54.383
My work improved.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.719
Even work was fun again.

50:56.721 --> 50:59.522
It was the best
I'd felt in months.

50:59.524 --> 51:00.823
I was confident.

51:00.825 --> 51:02.491
And it sparked our marriage.

51:04.228 --> 51:07.830
But then the kicker, I
couldn't get Nikki pregnant.

51:08.833 --> 51:10.533
It was my genes, after all.

51:10.535 --> 51:15.237
And so my bloodline would
stop with me, an only child.

51:18.476 --> 51:20.576
It wasn't even
really a discussion.

51:20.578 --> 51:22.211
It was over.

51:22.213 --> 51:23.479
She wanted her own kids

51:23.481 --> 51:25.748
and a life I couldn't give her.

51:25.750 --> 51:29.518
Nikki sold the wedding rings,
and I kept our shitty Taurus.

51:38.229 --> 51:39.228
Okay.

51:39.230 --> 51:40.129
Should I?

51:40.131 --> 51:41.263
Looks good.

51:42.700 --> 51:44.733
No, a little bit
up on your side.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.470
- There we go.
- Yeah, it's good.

51:47.472 --> 51:48.471
Perfect.

52:00.418 --> 52:04.286
Eso.

52:04.288 --> 52:06.188
You know what happens if
we do this right, Blade?

52:06.190 --> 52:07.723
It's so important.

52:07.725 --> 52:08.557
Huh?

52:08.559 --> 52:10.475
Close your eyes.

52:10.477 --> 52:12.394
Do it, keep workin' the
dough, but close your eyes.

52:12.396 --> 52:17.333
Now imagine the most
wonderful crust in the world.

52:17.335 --> 52:18.567
Yeah.

52:19.804 --> 52:22.638
We wanna develop the
stands of gluten.

52:22.640 --> 52:26.609
Light and airy with
just the right chew.

52:26.611 --> 52:29.178
Crisp with a beautiful char.

52:29.780 --> 52:30.679
Yeah.

52:30.681 --> 52:31.914
- You see it?
- Yeah.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.649
Okay, now put that
love in the dough.

52:33.651 --> 52:34.717
Good, put it in the punch.

52:34.719 --> 52:37.253
Beautiful. Pero con amor.

52:37.255 --> 52:39.421
That's it, now own it, brother!

52:39.423 --> 52:40.422
Do it, Blade!

52:44.695 --> 52:47.630
That's it, send that
beautiful ball back to daddy.

52:48.466 --> 52:50.266
That's what I'm talkin' about.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.901
Now give us a fresh 10.

52:54.772 --> 52:56.572
Good machine.

52:56.574 --> 52:58.774
All right, Joe, little
somethin' goofy goin' on

52:58.776 --> 53:00.809
with pinsetter in lane three.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.711
It sounds a little fucked up.

53:02.713 --> 53:05.247
Figure her out, and then
our work's done here.

53:05.249 --> 53:08.684
Yeh, sounds like the cycle
solenoid's outta whack, easy fix.

53:21.399 --> 53:22.631
So like I was saying,

53:22.633 --> 53:23.966
foodies have gotten
so sophisticated,

53:23.968 --> 53:26.335
there's very little
margin for error.

53:26.337 --> 53:28.237
But with all the great
pizzerias in the world,

53:28.239 --> 53:30.940
why shouldn't the best one
in the Northwest be here

53:30.942 --> 53:32.241
in Phoenix, Oregon.

53:32.977 --> 53:34.376
Because it's on Portland.

53:34.378 --> 53:35.844
There are some great
pies in Portland,

53:35.846 --> 53:37.813
but nothing like this.

53:38.883 --> 53:39.782
Try it.

53:43.254 --> 53:45.888
Write about that
in your article.

53:56.867 --> 53:59.401
Al, Joe, the lanes look great.

53:59.403 --> 54:00.302
Thank you.

54:05.876 --> 54:07.743
You said it was
gonna be $10,000.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.245
This is twice that.

54:10.414 --> 54:11.647
What the fuck, Al?

54:11.649 --> 54:14.383
We've replaced nine
sections of lane.

54:14.385 --> 54:17.820
I worked on this job for
93 hours, and I stink.

54:17.822 --> 54:19.788
Joe and me restored your lanes.

54:19.790 --> 54:21.890
We repaired and oiled all 24.

54:21.892 --> 54:24.660
We fixed 11 pinsetters
with new parts.

54:24.662 --> 54:25.894
Well, thanks for
clarifying that.

54:25.896 --> 54:28.297
I want a goddamn
cashier's check.

54:28.299 --> 54:30.799
All right, relax, Al.

54:30.801 --> 54:31.734
You'll have your check.

54:31.736 --> 54:34.336
You better, or you won't open.

54:34.338 --> 54:35.804
I got a lot of
bowlers comin' in here

54:35.806 --> 54:37.273
for your little
tournament, Hoffy.

54:37.275 --> 54:38.974
So don't fuck with me.

54:57.328 --> 54:57.993
It's really expensive.

54:57.995 --> 54:59.395
- Well, here...
- Ooh.

54:59.397 --> 55:00.429
- Is a little pick-me-up...
- Wow.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.897
After that debacle.

55:01.899 --> 55:04.400
Root beer floats for the kids.

55:04.402 --> 55:07.636
All locally made, vanilla
organic gelato and...

55:07.638 --> 55:08.837
Oh, my god.

55:08.839 --> 55:09.905
Caldera root beer.

55:09.907 --> 55:11.974
- Mm.
- Okay, Bobby.

55:11.976 --> 55:14.343
- Delectable, brother.
- Holy smokes.

55:14.345 --> 55:16.445
- These are seriously ridic.
- Mm.

55:16.447 --> 55:17.413
You like?

55:17.415 --> 55:18.080
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

55:18.082 --> 55:19.048
- Mm.
- Wow.

55:19.050 --> 55:20.983
I have to bring this up.

55:20.985 --> 55:23.819
Now that Al doubled the
price on his repairs,

55:23.821 --> 55:26.889
Mario's deposit hasn't
hit the account yet, so.

55:26.891 --> 55:28.090
Really, why not?

55:28.092 --> 55:29.491
What's goin' on, Tanya?

55:30.528 --> 55:31.360
Don't worry.

55:31.362 --> 55:32.528
He has to, you know,

55:32.530 --> 55:34.930
he's just busy
getting liquid for,

55:34.932 --> 55:36.098
to match this deposit
he has to make

55:36.100 --> 55:37.433
on the Phoenix Farm deal.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.667
He has to do a
million dollars cash.

55:38.669 --> 55:41.537
That's why he's been in
Dubai and Tokyo, and.

55:41.539 --> 55:42.771
Yeah, of course.

55:42.773 --> 55:45.107
And we've got enough
money to cover us.

55:45.109 --> 55:46.542
- Yeah.
- So we're all right.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.711
Trust me, $50,000 is
nothing to this guy.

55:48.713 --> 55:49.978
I've seen how hard he works.

55:51.015 --> 55:51.814
- Absolutely.
- And plus,

55:51.816 --> 55:52.848
this is your destiny.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.049
Absolutely!

55:54.051 --> 55:55.651
You're livin' it.

55:56.921 --> 55:57.853
How many
bowlers do we have, Marie?

55:57.855 --> 55:59.388
We have 16 so far.

55:59.390 --> 56:01.357
We are golden.

56:01.359 --> 56:02.725
All right.

56:03.494 --> 56:04.927
Your wine, sir.

56:04.929 --> 56:06.929
Oh, perfect timing.

56:06.931 --> 56:08.997
Yeah, you sign for that.

56:08.999 --> 56:09.898
Yeah.

56:13.037 --> 56:14.036
Wow, that's really fillin' up.

56:14.038 --> 56:15.671
You guys did a good job.

56:15.673 --> 56:16.872
Couldn't have
done it without Al,

56:16.874 --> 56:18.841
as much as I hate to admit it.

56:19.710 --> 56:20.943
All right.

56:20.945 --> 56:23.479
I need to deal with
my other accounts.

56:23.481 --> 56:24.713
Are you all good?

56:24.715 --> 56:25.647
- Yeah.
- Good.

56:25.649 --> 56:26.849
Thanks again for all your help

56:26.851 --> 56:28.083
- way above the call of duty.
- Yeah.

56:28.085 --> 56:30.719
Oh, there was one thing
I wanted to ask you.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.888
You?

56:32.890 --> 56:34.757
Do you still
wanna bowl with me?

56:36.961 --> 56:38.994
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

56:41.031 --> 56:42.030
Yeah.

56:42.032 --> 56:44.533
Yeah,
I would love to.

56:44.535 --> 56:46.635
I can't tonight, though, I got
a conference call with Mario.

56:46.637 --> 56:48.036
But I can tomorrow.

56:48.038 --> 56:49.438
Okay.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.706
Okay.

56:50.708 --> 56:52.574
I'll just be
staring at the clock.

56:52.576 --> 56:54.777
Well, don't be
starin' at my butt.

56:54.779 --> 56:55.944
Too late.

57:38.823 --> 57:39.955
First-batch pancetta, man.

57:39.957 --> 57:40.789
What do you think?

57:40.791 --> 57:41.957
Mm, it's good, man.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.058
- Yeah?
- Very good.

57:43.060 --> 57:44.026
Excellent.

57:44.028 --> 57:44.927
Mm.

57:44.929 --> 57:48.797
Hey, Carlos, should we
make this Calabrese 20 bucks?

57:48.799 --> 57:50.232
No, I
wanna keep it simple.

57:50.234 --> 57:53.035
So Tio, what if someone
wants just a pepperoni?

57:53.037 --> 57:54.203
No.

57:54.205 --> 57:56.004
We've only got
four choices, okay.

57:56.006 --> 57:57.773
And all the ingredients
are important.

57:57.775 --> 57:59.775
The whole is greater
than the sum of the parts.

57:59.777 --> 58:02.611
What if somebody wants
a Calabrese, but not spicy?

58:02.613 --> 58:05.747
Look, if you don't like it
hot, there's three other pies.

58:05.749 --> 58:07.483
I like it hot.

58:07.485 --> 58:08.217
It's so good, Rudy.

58:08.219 --> 58:09.885
I haven't tried it yet, man.

58:09.887 --> 58:11.487
Well, you should try it.

58:11.489 --> 58:12.721
Have it for lunch.

58:12.723 --> 58:14.556
Carlos has got it
totally dialed.

58:14.558 --> 58:15.858
Thank you.

58:15.860 --> 58:18.927
So people are paying 18
bucks for a small pizza?

58:18.929 --> 58:22.965
Rudy, 12 inches
is the perfect size, man.

58:22.967 --> 58:25.267
Bigger or smaller
compromises the crust.

58:25.269 --> 58:26.168
It's not small.

58:26.170 --> 58:28.103
It's perfect for two.

58:28.105 --> 58:29.972
I just think some
people might want a large.

58:29.974 --> 58:31.306
That's all I'm saying.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.641
You're
not listening to me.

58:32.643 --> 58:34.610
There's only one size, okay.

58:34.612 --> 58:36.678
If they want more,
they can order more.

58:36.680 --> 58:38.146
Tio, don't take it wrong.

58:38.148 --> 58:39.615
I just know that
families around here

58:39.617 --> 58:41.283
are lookin' for a
deal, that's all.

58:41.285 --> 58:42.818
You know what, they don't
have to go all the way

58:42.820 --> 58:44.019
to New York for a great pie.

58:44.021 --> 58:45.153
That's the deal.

58:45.155 --> 58:46.822
If you wanna save money,

58:46.824 --> 58:49.725
then go get a coupon from
a pinche pizza chain.

58:49.727 --> 58:52.027
Get a cheap, extra
large, extra doughy,

58:52.029 --> 58:54.830
tasteless pizza crust
topped with bland sauce

58:54.832 --> 58:57.398
and processed ingredients,

58:57.400 --> 58:59.967
loaded with partially hydrogenated
oils, and maybe even MSG.

58:59.970 --> 59:02.004
It makes me sick just
thinking about it.

59:07.912 --> 59:09.545
Look at it this way, Rudy.

59:09.547 --> 59:10.779
We're saving 'em on airfare.

59:10.781 --> 59:13.015
That's a $600
savings right there.

59:18.255 --> 59:20.789
So Nephew, I'm so
sorry for what happened earlier.

59:20.791 --> 59:22.057
- Nah.
- You know, I'm just...

59:22.059 --> 59:24.092
You were right, it was my bad.

59:24.094 --> 59:25.060
But I just...

59:27.965 --> 59:29.847
It's just that I,

59:29.849 --> 59:31.732
you know, this menu's
really particular to me.

59:33.604 --> 59:34.303
Sorry.

59:36.707 --> 59:37.873
I know, Tio.

59:43.681 --> 59:44.880
- Woo!
- That's it, Hoffman!

59:44.882 --> 59:46.949
My Hoffy, baby!

59:46.951 --> 59:47.950
Listen up, guys.

59:50.054 --> 59:52.287
Mario's big-time check
has been deposited.

59:52.289 --> 59:55.123
The Phoenix Farms deal is
closed and fully funded.

59:55.125 --> 59:57.359
And that means you are funded.

59:57.361 --> 59:58.327
Oh!

59:58.329 --> 59:59.227
That's right.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.130
Thank you, Tanya.

01:00:02.132 --> 01:00:02.965
Yeah.

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:04.066
Boyyy!

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.101
Oh, nice.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.302
- Roll a strike.
- Okay.

01:00:07.304 --> 01:00:09.071
And the aliens come through.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.706
Woo!

01:00:23.354 --> 01:00:24.186
Yeah.

01:00:24.188 --> 01:00:25.053
I was into golf.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:25.988
It's your sport.

01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:28.657
Don't play with me.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.340
Yeah, I think that's on fire.

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:47.142
Yes, it was.

01:00:58.055 --> 01:00:58.887
Yes.

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:06.361
Oh, yeah.

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:09.031
I see a lot of potential.

01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:48.336
You want the tour now?

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.399
Hey.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.034
You want some coffee?

01:02:53.971 --> 01:02:54.803
Multiple cups.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:07.315
Right?

01:03:08.252 --> 01:03:10.051
Will do.

01:03:10.053 --> 01:03:11.353
No, that's what I was saying.

01:03:17.494 --> 01:03:19.161
Yeah, they do.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:24.032
But it seems like everything's
coming together, really.

01:03:24.034 --> 01:03:25.233
I know.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:26.501
Yeah, me, too.

01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:38.280
Hey, thanks for last night.

01:03:39.883 --> 01:03:42.384
Your trailer
is actually not that bad.

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:46.454
Built for one, but I get it.

01:03:47.858 --> 01:03:49.357
Well, in my mind anyway,

01:03:49.359 --> 01:03:51.593
my Airstream's always
been kind of a stop gap.

01:03:51.595 --> 01:03:55.463
But probably time
for some new digs.

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:56.364
You think?

01:04:10.247 --> 01:04:12.581
Guys, Mario's comin'.

01:04:14.051 --> 01:04:15.383
Gets to Salt Lake
this afternoon,

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:16.852
and he hits Portland tonight.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:19.921
So it will be late,
but he will be here.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:20.856
- Oh.
- Yeah.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:22.123
That's great news.

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.391
Make sure and save

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.160
- a Calabrese for Mario.
- Rudy,.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:27.295
Four or five cars
just pulled up.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.330
Really?

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:29.297
Yeah.

01:04:29.299 --> 01:04:30.232
That's great.

01:04:30.234 --> 01:04:31.032
Come on, all right, everyone.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:32.434
Man your stations.

01:04:32.436 --> 01:04:34.035
Right,
let's go, everybody.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:34.870
Woo!

01:04:34.872 --> 01:04:35.570
Game time.

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:42.143
Welcome to Rising Phoenix.

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:43.311
What are you drinkin'?

01:04:56.326 --> 01:04:59.060
Hey, Carlos, we
got come customers.

01:05:02.132 --> 01:05:03.098
All right.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:07.269
I would suggest the Elisa.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:08.370
It's an original
creation of mine.

01:05:08.372 --> 01:05:10.939
But all of the
pies are delicious.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:11.673
Welcome.

01:05:11.675 --> 01:05:13.074
What can I get for you?

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.442
- Hi.
- Can I get a size sevens?

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:15.377
It's perfect.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.378
Yes.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.646
I can help you.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.249
There you are.

01:05:31.395 --> 01:05:34.629
Lookin'
good, lookin' good.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.601
Six more orders, Tio.

01:05:39.603 --> 01:05:42.437
All right, let's keep
it movin', everybody.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.271
I got it.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.307
Thank you.

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:46.474
All right, what can I get you?

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:47.475
There's a line.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:48.343
Root beer float.

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:49.644
Thank you.

01:05:49.646 --> 01:05:51.046
You got my check?

01:05:54.952 --> 01:05:56.584
This ain't a cashier's check.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:57.519
It's a check, Al.

01:05:57.521 --> 01:05:58.453
It's good, just go cash it.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.255
Can't you see I'm slammed?

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:02.424
You know
somethin', Hoffy,

01:06:02.426 --> 01:06:05.160
you're goin' down today.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:07.662
You're goin' way
down to the ground

01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:09.364
where the hedgehogs frown.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:15.737
God, I love bowling.

01:06:15.739 --> 01:06:19.140
You had
me goin' there, Al.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.675
Thanks for opening
up this place.

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:23.345
Well, thanks
for all your work.

01:06:23.347 --> 01:06:25.013
Hey, can I buy you
and Joe a drink?

01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:27.716
We'll have two ice-cold
Budweisers, no more, no less.

01:06:30.053 --> 01:06:31.619
I don't have Budweiser.

01:06:31.621 --> 01:06:33.989
But I got great organic
pilsner from Bend.

01:06:35.759 --> 01:06:37.325
Yeah, we'll have two waters.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:39.561
No ice.

01:06:41.698 --> 01:06:43.264
Two waters, no ice.

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:52.273
Excuse me, I got a
tournament game to play here.

01:06:52.275 --> 01:06:53.174
It's lane 23.

01:06:56.046 --> 01:06:57.479
Are you Guadalupe?

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:58.747
Como estas?

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:19.034
You got this, don't
let him get in your head.

01:07:27.344 --> 01:07:29.477
Two Elisas, enjoy.

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:31.179
Boom, boom, piping hot.

01:07:33.116 --> 01:07:34.649
Here you go, buffalo pesto.

01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:38.553
And then another Calabrese.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:39.621
Enjoy, everybody.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.829
Good.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:49.497
Can I get some goddamn
service around here?

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:52.434
Ah.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.535
You hungry, we're a little busy.

01:07:53.537 --> 01:07:54.836
You want a pie?

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:57.205
Sure, I'll take a large
pepperoni, extra cheese.

01:07:57.207 --> 01:07:58.773
We don't do that here, bro.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.475
You telling me you
don't have cheese

01:08:00.477 --> 01:08:01.709
and fuckin'
pepperoni back there?

01:08:01.711 --> 01:08:03.778
Our Napoletano pizzas
are made for scratch,

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.246
12 inches in diameter,

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:07.148
four different styles,
no substitutions.

01:08:07.150 --> 01:08:08.750
No substitutions.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:11.486
Don't do this, man.

01:08:11.488 --> 01:08:13.254
Do you want a pie or not?

01:08:13.256 --> 01:08:15.356
Yeah, I'll take a calabrese.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.658
Okay.

01:08:17.661 --> 01:08:19.527
- Blade!
- Yes, sir?

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:21.395
Can I get a calabrese for
my bro here, extra spicy.

01:08:21.398 --> 01:08:23.798
Calabrese, extra
spicy, comin' right up.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.567
Can I get
five more margaritas?

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:28.136
Take these out.

01:08:28.138 --> 01:08:28.870
Bam.

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:30.471
Flow, flow, flow, flow, flow.

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:01.536
Hey, Tanya.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.203
Mm-hmm?

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:05.807
Can you cover the bar
for me when I bowl my game?

01:09:07.344 --> 01:09:08.343
Sure.

01:09:08.345 --> 01:09:09.676
I'm fine, I'm here.

01:09:09.679 --> 01:09:11.613
I scheduled my game
for after the lunch rush.

01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.814
I guess I just wanted
to see how busy we were.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:14.716
It's fine.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:16.885
I'm just gonna be here
all weekend anyway,

01:09:16.886 --> 01:09:18.620
'cause Mario asked me to, so.

01:09:20.290 --> 01:09:21.221
Oh, yeah?

01:09:21.224 --> 01:09:22.724
Why did he ask you to do that?

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:24.926
Just to keep an eye on
things, send him updates.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:26.194
Huh.

01:09:26.196 --> 01:09:28.429
Well, Carlos and I can do that.

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:31.232
Yeah, but he knows I've
worked in a million restaurants.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:33.667
So have I.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.837
Yes, but he wants
an unbiased opinion.

01:09:36.706 --> 01:09:37.805
On what, on me?

01:09:39.242 --> 01:09:40.675
Don't be so sensitive.

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.212
Mario put his money in, too.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.380
He has a right to ask questions.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:47.215
I'm his proxy.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:50.685
Why do you think I've been
hanging out and helping for long?

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:54.789
I don't know, 'cause
I thought you liked me,

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.759
or you were enjoying yourself.

01:09:57.761 --> 01:09:58.726
I am.

01:10:02.799 --> 01:10:04.599
But this is just
part of the job.

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:10.805
Okay.

01:10:10.807 --> 01:10:12.807
Look, man, this is like a
super-stressful weekend.

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:17.212
Maybe last night
wasn't the best timing.

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:19.447
But I mean, I can handle it.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:20.782
Yeah, well, you're the pro.

01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:27.288
Sorry, I didn't, that's
not what I meant.

01:10:30.293 --> 01:10:31.326
I can handle it.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:33.661
I'm sorry.

01:10:35.665 --> 01:10:37.799
There's that
14-year-old boy again.

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.334
Not always so cute, is he?

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.005
Hi.

01:10:44.007 --> 01:10:44.839
- Hello.
- Can I get a pint

01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:45.707
of pilsner, please?

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:47.475
Yes, you may.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.918
Hey, Bobby, Carlos needs you.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:01.823
What's up?

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:04.025
I'm outta dough, man.

01:11:04.027 --> 01:11:05.393
Well, just make some more.

01:11:05.395 --> 01:11:07.028
It's a complicated
process, bro.

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.763
It takes hours and hours.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:09.697
No.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:11.299
How many pizzas did you sell?

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:13.601
40,000 grams of flour.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:14.702
What is that?

01:11:14.704 --> 01:11:16.804
- What is that?
- It's over 100 pies.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.473
That's incredible.

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:19.307
Yeah.

01:11:19.309 --> 01:11:19.941
All right.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:20.808
Hey, everybody.

01:11:20.810 --> 01:11:22.644
Hey, everybody, hey.

01:11:23.413 --> 01:11:24.812
Great day so far.

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:27.815
But we've run our of dough.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:29.884
Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:11:29.886 --> 01:11:30.818
I know, I know.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:32.487
But part of the reason is,

01:11:32.489 --> 01:11:35.590
my partner Carlos comes in
here every day, crack of dawn,

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:38.593
makes this delicious
dough with his hands.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:39.794
That's why it's so good.

01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:40.795
And we're probably
gonna run out of dough

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:42.430
at some other time
in the future.

01:11:42.432 --> 01:11:44.399
So you're gonna need to
reserve your pies in advance.

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:47.001
Silver lining is that
Rudy's Taqueria is showing up

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.002
with their taco truck.

01:11:48.004 --> 01:11:49.437
They'll be here soon.

01:11:49.439 --> 01:11:50.471
Go get some of that
delicious grub.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:52.774
Come back in and keep bowling.

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:53.908
Thanks.

01:11:57.514 --> 01:11:58.613
Thanks, bro.

01:11:58.615 --> 01:11:59.914
Sure.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:06.821
Nice goin'.

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:17.098
We good, Uncle?

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:18.066
Yeah, gracias, Sobrino.

01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:19.334
You saved the day.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:21.803
No te procupes.

01:12:21.805 --> 01:12:23.071
Damn, I don't even
have enough dough left

01:12:23.073 --> 01:12:24.906
to make Mario his Calabrese.

01:12:24.908 --> 01:12:26.908
You're gonna have
to freeze the dough.

01:12:26.910 --> 01:12:28.743
That way you never run out.

01:12:29.879 --> 01:12:31.746
I have a 100-year
mother yeast starter

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.847
in my kitchen, Rudy.

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:35.949
Okay, you can't freeze the
dough, mi hijo, that's crazy.

01:12:35.952 --> 01:12:38.086
How many times do I have
to explain that to you.

01:12:38.088 --> 01:12:39.687
Okay, but now you're
gonna have to hire

01:12:39.689 --> 01:12:41.122
a bigger kitchen staff.

01:12:41.124 --> 01:12:43.491
You can't teach this in a day.

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:44.959
It takes months, ask Blade.

01:12:46.596 --> 01:12:50.031
Well, then I don't
know what to say, Tio.

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:52.934
You're leavin' a lot
of money on the table.

01:13:04.948 --> 01:13:07.482
After everything I've
done for you, Bobby,

01:13:07.484 --> 01:13:08.816
five years my employee...

01:13:08.818 --> 01:13:09.916
You've done nothing for me.

01:13:09.918 --> 01:13:11.017
Hey, hey, hey,
let's be cool, guys.

01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:11.953
Let's make peace, man.

01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:13.588
It's not worth the karma.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:15.890
I taught you everything
about this business.

01:13:15.892 --> 01:13:18.693
I find your confrontational
approach shocking.

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:20.628
Be cool, Kyle, come on.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.063
Carlos, you've really
outdone yourself with this.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.932
You know, I might
put this on my menu.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:26.134
100% legal.

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:27.835
I'd like
to see you try.

01:13:27.837 --> 01:13:31.005
Bobby, he's already
paid and registered.

01:13:32.475 --> 01:13:33.574
What are you doing,
that's against the rules.

01:13:33.576 --> 01:13:34.409
I've already paid.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.010
I make the rules here.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:38.579
Oh, I see.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:39.881
- Oh.
- You want a piece of me?

01:13:40.817 --> 01:13:42.650
Bring it on, Superman.

01:13:42.652 --> 01:13:43.951
Ooh.

01:13:43.953 --> 01:13:44.919
Bring it on.

01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.721
Vendetta bowl.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:47.755
Grudge match,

01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:49.824
grudge match, grudge match.

01:13:51.161 --> 01:13:52.794
Okay.

01:13:56.433 --> 01:13:57.865
Close your eyes.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:58.966
Close your eyes.

01:13:58.968 --> 01:14:01.903
What I like to do in the
kitchen is I visualize, right.

01:14:01.905 --> 01:14:03.438
I see the heat.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:04.939
I see the melting cheese.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:09.577
I see the char on the
crust, the meat so tender.

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:10.511
What are you talking about?

01:14:10.513 --> 01:14:13.363
Sorry.

01:14:13.365 --> 01:14:16.216
Visualize the lanes, just
you and the shiny hardwood.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.820
Imagine the pins.

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:22.824
Now watch them all fall.

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:27.895
Falling pins falling down.

01:14:27.897 --> 01:14:32.800
Falling pins falling down.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:41.509
That's what I'm talkin' about.

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:42.577
Great visualization.

01:14:57.494 --> 01:14:58.693
Woo!

01:14:58.695 --> 01:14:59.994
Don't make me do
the touchdown dance.

01:14:59.996 --> 01:15:00.862
Don't, don't do that.

01:15:00.864 --> 01:15:02.697
Come on.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.007
Woo!

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:13.908
Yeah!

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:16.811
Bobby!

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:39.734
Oh, man.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.970
The lanes are too slick,
can't keep it in the pocket.

01:15:42.972 --> 01:15:43.905
God.

01:15:43.907 --> 01:15:45.940
That's 'cause you suck, man.

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:47.008
The lanes are fine.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:49.359
Who is this?

01:15:49.361 --> 01:15:50.744
A much better bowler
than you, jackass.

01:15:50.747 --> 01:15:51.913
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:53.147
Easy, guys, there's
kids present.

01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:54.916
You wanna see a
real hook stretch?

01:15:54.918 --> 01:15:57.218
Stick around for my next round.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.119
Let's go, Joe.

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:01.956
I can't play under
these conditions.

01:16:09.966 --> 01:16:12.133
Well, I knew you were a stealer.

01:16:12.135 --> 01:16:15.069
So it shouldn't come as a
surprise that you're a cheater.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.705
Kyle, you are a one-percenter

01:16:17.707 --> 01:16:20.341
that used to steal
money out of my tip jar.

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:22.076
Why don't you get outta here.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.911
One-percenter?

01:16:23.913 --> 01:16:25.346
Bobby, I'm broke.

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:28.282
And I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:16:28.284 --> 01:16:30.184
I'll stick around
and watch you lose.

01:16:35.959 --> 01:16:37.625
Come on.

01:16:37.627 --> 01:16:38.993
Go in.

01:16:41.864 --> 01:16:42.897
Come on.

01:16:42.899 --> 01:16:44.599
Put it in, put it in!

01:16:44.601 --> 01:16:45.933
Come on.

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.702
Go in, go in.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:52.640
Go in, go in.

01:16:55.678 --> 01:16:56.310
Hey.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:57.745
Hey.

01:16:57.747 --> 01:16:59.280
I have to bowl again.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:02.750
No, ask
Blade or Carlos or...

01:17:02.752 --> 01:17:04.785
They don't know their way
around a bar like you do.

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.253
Well, find someone who does.

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:07.188
What about Rudy?

01:17:07.190 --> 01:17:08.122
Just one more hour.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.223
What if you keep winning?

01:17:09.225 --> 01:17:10.691
People think I work here now.

01:17:10.693 --> 01:17:11.926
I need to not be doing this.

01:17:11.928 --> 01:17:15.329
Well, I don't wanna
damage your reputation,

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:17.331
Oh, you are incredible.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.066
I've been helping
you for months.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:20.701
You've been helpin' Mario.

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:21.836
Mario's not here.

01:17:21.838 --> 01:17:23.137
Well, he'll be here later.

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:24.772
You can give him
your report the.

01:17:24.774 --> 01:17:26.707
Actually, no, his
flight was delayed,

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.110
and he's not gonna be
here 'til tomorrow now.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.945
Is that why you're so upset?

01:17:30.947 --> 01:17:32.847
That has nothing
to do with it.

01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:35.016
Tell me the truth.

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:37.718
Last night, was that like,

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:40.121
just taking one for
the team for you?

01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:43.724
Wait, what?

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:45.860
Your recon mission
to the trailer.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.062
Was that just due
diligence for Mario?

01:17:51.901 --> 01:17:54.068
You are a paranoid
little child.

01:17:57.774 --> 01:17:59.774
And this is the last
drink I'm pouring.

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.353
I can bartend, Bobby.

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.254
No problem.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:16.691
Seriously, no worries, man.

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:46.987
You see that, you see that?

01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:07.241
Damn.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:13.948
All right, Al.

01:19:14.951 --> 01:19:16.050
Yes!

01:19:33.469 --> 01:19:35.102
That's it, Bobby.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.083
Go, go.

01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:56.157
There's no need for hostilities.

01:19:58.561 --> 01:20:01.061
Here you go, Al.

01:20:37.033 --> 01:20:39.533
Yeah, boom!

01:20:39.535 --> 01:20:41.168
Yeah.

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:42.036
Yeah.

01:20:42.939 --> 01:20:43.604
Yeah.

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.049
Ha.

01:20:59.856 --> 01:21:00.588
Yes!

01:21:05.428 --> 01:21:07.394
Oh! All day long, all day.

01:22:03.552 --> 01:22:05.019
There you go.

01:22:05.021 --> 01:22:06.086
Yo, Bobby's got a
perfect game goin'.

01:22:06.088 --> 01:22:07.242
Vamos.

01:22:07.244 --> 01:22:08.398
Ra, ra, ra, yay.

01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.555
Hey, Kyle, you wanna
join us and go watch Bobby?

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:10.691
Hell no, I taught you
everything you know,

01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:12.993
and then you go and abandon me.

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:18.132
Ah, I feel like a jerk.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.667
I'm gonna go home.

01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:21.969
Nobody gives a shit.

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:37.384
Hey.

01:22:37.386 --> 01:22:38.285
Hey, hey.

01:22:40.589 --> 01:22:42.456
You got this, Hoffy.

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:44.692
It wasn't my night.

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:46.460
Now it's yours for the taking.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:52.199
So go ahead, just put your
boot on my neck and break it.

01:22:52.201 --> 01:22:54.168
Put me outta my misery, bigshot.

01:22:55.404 --> 01:22:57.604
Break my neck with a 300 score.

01:22:57.606 --> 01:23:01.475
This is what I live for,
okay, Hoffy, frame 10.

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.744
I can smell the turkey
cooking already.

01:23:03.746 --> 01:23:06.547
I can smell the
turkey cooking, Bob.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:21.628
Visualize.

01:25:19.381 --> 01:25:20.848
So on behalf of Rudy's
Taqueria,

01:25:20.850 --> 01:25:24.618
we would like to present this
check for $2,000 to the winner

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:28.655
of the first annual Rising
Phoenix Bowling Tournament.

01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.257
Bobby Hoffman.

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:32.726
Bobby!

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.762
Hey, thanks.

01:25:38.434 --> 01:25:40.667
Why don't you hold it, thanks.

01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:42.202
You guys are awesome, thanks.

01:25:43.272 --> 01:25:44.771
I should first
thank our partner,

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:49.376
who is not here today, Mario,
'cause he predicted this.

01:25:49.378 --> 01:25:51.211
How he knew that, I don't know.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:56.283
And of course, Tanya, who,

01:25:58.521 --> 01:25:59.720
well, I just wanna say thank you

01:25:59.722 --> 01:26:01.455
for all the time
that you've put on.

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:06.426
Sorry.

01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:11.431
I just can't even believe
we've pulled this off.

01:26:12.568 --> 01:26:15.869
Also, of course, Rudy
and Marie and Guadalupe,

01:26:15.871 --> 01:26:19.673
and Blade and Liz, and
everybody else that's helped.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:22.809
Of course, Al and Joe,

01:26:22.811 --> 01:26:24.778
couldn't have pulled
this off without you.

01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:30.751
I just wanna say one
special thing to Carlos.

01:26:31.754 --> 01:26:33.253
Finally, you have the kitchen

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:35.956
to do what you love and do best.

01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:41.662
I love you, man.

01:26:50.306 --> 01:26:51.471
Thanks, thanks.

01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:52.873
Congratulations.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:54.942
So I just sign the
back of it, right?

01:27:02.818 --> 01:27:04.418
Hey,
you want one more?

01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.519
Thank you, Blade.

01:27:05.521 --> 01:27:08.255
That one is
definitely on the house.

01:27:08.257 --> 01:27:09.590
Think I earned it?

01:27:10.426 --> 01:27:11.525
Yeah, you sure did.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:16.930
That was, like, crazy.

01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:18.599
You're a local hero.

01:27:19.435 --> 01:27:20.901
That was incredible.

01:27:20.903 --> 01:27:22.302
I don't know.

01:27:22.304 --> 01:27:24.238
But I would like to apologize

01:27:24.240 --> 01:27:27.808
for making such a
ridiculous fool of myself.

01:27:28.811 --> 01:27:30.244
I don't get what I want,

01:27:30.246 --> 01:27:31.812
and then I just say
the stupidest things.

01:27:33.382 --> 01:27:34.281
I'm sorry.

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:38.518
Dude.

01:27:40.889 --> 01:27:44.925
It was a solid opening night,
and we had a good time, right?

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:46.727
So let's just leave it at that.

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:51.498
That's it then?

01:27:53.936 --> 01:27:54.835
Yeah.

01:27:56.538 --> 01:27:58.672
You need to take care
of yourself, Bobby.

01:27:59.842 --> 01:28:01.842
This heaviness that
you're carrying around,

01:28:01.844 --> 01:28:03.777
it's really not working for you.

01:28:03.779 --> 01:28:06.413
I mean, these could be the
best years of your life.

01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:07.714
Do you realize that?

01:28:10.919 --> 01:28:13.920
You need to finish that book.

01:28:13.922 --> 01:28:16.757
And then you need to stop
drawing pictures of your ex.

01:28:16.759 --> 01:28:20.861
Because it's very sweet,
but it's really a turnoff.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:28.335
I really let you
down, didn't I?

01:28:28.337 --> 01:28:29.736
Me, no.

01:28:29.738 --> 01:28:31.838
You disappointed you.

01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:32.973
I am fine.

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:33.940
I can take care of myself.

01:28:33.942 --> 01:28:35.442
I am a grown woman.

01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:43.583
You need to celebrate.

01:28:43.585 --> 01:28:45.085
You deserve this,
you earned it, too.

01:28:45.087 --> 01:28:45.986
Come on.

01:28:47.022 --> 01:28:49.623
Hey, Tanya, join us.

01:29:28.964 --> 01:29:30.063
See.

01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.002
Mornin', fellas.

01:29:36.004 --> 01:29:37.037
Morning, sir.

01:29:37.039 --> 01:29:38.972
Bigshot, day two.

01:29:38.974 --> 01:29:40.073
Beautiful day.

01:29:54.723 --> 01:29:55.956
Fuck.

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:09.536
Okay.

01:30:10.572 --> 01:30:12.105
Hey, Bobby, it's Al.

01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:15.776
His check didn't clear.

01:30:24.653 --> 01:30:25.552
Fuck.

01:30:27.489 --> 01:30:28.655
What happened?

01:30:28.657 --> 01:30:30.023
None of his
numbers are working.

01:30:32.828 --> 01:30:34.494
You haven't gotten
ahold of him yet?

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:35.629
No.

01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:36.696
What about Jenny?

01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:37.998
I just tried calling her,

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.966
and her number is
out of service, too.

01:30:41.069 --> 01:30:43.003
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:44.438
He was also a signer.

01:30:47.709 --> 01:30:49.443
There's over 90
grand in there.

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:51.912
He's emptied our accounts?!

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:54.080
We don't know that yet.

01:30:54.082 --> 01:30:55.749
Maybe he moved the
money to an account

01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:56.983
with a higher interest rate.

01:30:56.985 --> 01:30:58.785
Maybe he just decided
to close his office.

01:30:58.787 --> 01:30:59.653
Wake up!

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:03.757
Tanya, there's gotta
be someone around here

01:31:03.759 --> 01:31:05.025
that knows him, right, someone?

01:31:05.027 --> 01:31:07.194
What about the weed guys,
the Phoenix Farm guys?

01:31:07.196 --> 01:31:09.930
Yeah, what about them?

01:31:09.932 --> 01:31:12.799
Their accounts have also
been emptied, $2 million.

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:15.735
I was one of 12 investors.

01:31:20.776 --> 01:31:22.809
Come on, he's famous, Tanya.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:26.746
I mean, there's gotta be some
other kind of contact info.

01:31:41.864 --> 01:31:43.029
He's a fraud.

01:31:45.033 --> 01:31:47.734
Mario Bentley Jr.,
even his name's a joke.

01:31:51.039 --> 01:31:52.973
How could I have
been so stupid?

01:31:55.277 --> 01:31:56.176
Not your fault.

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:10.724
We filed
fraud charges.

01:32:10.726 --> 01:32:13.927
As far as the law was concerned,
this guy didn't exist.

01:32:13.929 --> 01:32:15.896
Mario knew what he was doing.

01:32:15.898 --> 01:32:18.532
We tried to keep the place open,

01:32:18.534 --> 01:32:21.601
but with no cash, we were
operating month to month.

01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:24.738
And all the bowling crowd wanted

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.674
was cheap, greasy
food and Budweiser.

01:32:27.676 --> 01:32:29.743
Our old equipment
was breaking down,

01:32:29.745 --> 01:32:31.678
and we couldn't afford Al.

01:32:31.680 --> 01:32:33.847
And besides, Al was suing us.

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:38.685
The landlord seized the
property, and Al took it over.

01:32:40.122 --> 01:32:43.089
You know when you think
you're finally going for it,

01:32:43.091 --> 01:32:44.591
doing something important,

01:32:45.961 --> 01:32:47.794
and the next thing you know,

01:32:48.964 --> 01:32:50.730
you don't know what hit you,

01:32:50.732 --> 01:32:53.166
and you're right back
where you started?

01:32:57.606 --> 01:32:58.772
Are you any wiser now?

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:03.743
You rewind your life to analyze

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:06.046
what went wrong along the way.

01:33:08.784 --> 01:33:10.116
Your ex-wife,

01:33:14.756 --> 01:33:15.989
does she ever think of you?

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:17.991
No.

01:34:34.903 --> 01:34:38.138
So yeah, this is part of our
summer Hawaiian luau theme.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:39.806
It's part of a
national promotion

01:34:39.808 --> 01:34:44.344
celebrating our first Bingos
on Hawaii, the big island.

01:34:44.346 --> 01:34:46.379
Here, I saved a blue
one for you, bigshot.

01:34:46.381 --> 01:34:48.148
Make sure you get a good fit.

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:50.684
So we'll be having all
kinds of things on our menu.

01:34:50.686 --> 01:34:54.788
Poke, it is pronounced
poke, not poke or poke.

01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:57.257
We also will be having
huli-huli chicken,

01:34:57.259 --> 01:34:58.892
pork bun sliders.

01:34:59.795 --> 01:35:00.727
Good.

01:35:00.729 --> 01:35:04.464
Great to have an older
person on staff, Bobby.

01:35:04.466 --> 01:35:05.999
And also, Bingos
pineapple boat pizza.

01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:09.169
This is a boat pizza,
not just a regular pizza.

01:35:09.171 --> 01:35:10.970
And that's because
they're going to come

01:35:10.972 --> 01:35:13.840
in a boat shape
with a little sail.

01:35:57.886 --> 01:35:59.986
So how come you
never text me back?

01:36:02.290 --> 01:36:03.256
I'm here now.

01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:07.360
I'm sorry, Bobby.

01:36:09.965 --> 01:36:10.997
It wasn't my fault.

01:36:13.468 --> 01:36:15.001
They ever gonna
catch that guy?

01:36:15.003 --> 01:36:17.804
He just
vanished, man.

01:36:19.040 --> 01:36:21.040
What a piece of
work that guy was.

01:36:23.111 --> 01:36:25.011
I sure would
like my money back.

01:36:27.883 --> 01:36:29.883
So how's Bingos?

01:36:29.885 --> 01:36:33.353
It's a shitty, homogenized
disaster of a restaurant

01:36:33.355 --> 01:36:36.089
owned by a huge,
impersonal conglomerate.

01:36:36.091 --> 01:36:38.792
The food's awful, and
I get to wear a lei.

01:36:42.063 --> 01:36:46.900
Well, I've got some good
news, so just hear me out.

01:36:46.902 --> 01:36:49.803
Rudy, Marie, and my father

01:36:49.805 --> 01:36:52.105
are bankrolling
my new restaurant.

01:36:52.107 --> 01:36:53.273
You want a better job?

01:37:01.249 --> 01:37:02.582
I don't know.

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:08.922
Well, you don't
have to answer now.

01:37:08.924 --> 01:37:09.989
We open next month.

01:37:11.927 --> 01:37:13.026
Just drop by and see us.

01:37:14.396 --> 01:37:17.130
430 Main, are you kidding?

01:37:17.132 --> 01:37:18.932
No, Kyle went out
of business, man.

01:37:18.934 --> 01:37:20.066
They evicted him.

01:37:20.068 --> 01:37:21.601
Rudy knows the landlord.

01:37:21.603 --> 01:37:23.036
Fuckin' Kyle.

01:37:23.038 --> 01:37:26.573
Well, I guess there is
some justice in the world.

01:37:26.575 --> 01:37:29.576
So you're openin' this restaurant
instead of payin' me back?

01:37:31.613 --> 01:37:34.247
Bobby, I didn't
steal your money, bro.

01:37:34.249 --> 01:37:36.349
You need to get over it, dude.

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:38.051
Easy for you to say.

01:37:38.053 --> 01:37:40.253
I lost all my cash, too.

01:37:40.255 --> 01:37:43.623
Tanya and her cousins lost
$200,000, and they got over it.

01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:45.425
Even Al laughs about it now.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:50.897
God, if it's not my
fault, then it's Tanya's.

01:37:50.899 --> 01:37:53.233
If it's not Tanya's fault,
then it's the aliens.

01:37:57.906 --> 01:37:59.172
You know, Tanya was right.

01:37:59.174 --> 01:38:01.140
You really are like 14, man.

01:38:03.612 --> 01:38:05.111
Your aliens, you ever thought

01:38:05.113 --> 01:38:07.647
that maybe they're
tryin' to help you?

01:38:07.649 --> 01:38:09.215
You ever think about that?

01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.995
Hey, Bobby, David
Brinker, Curly Mullet Comics.

01:38:21.997 --> 01:38:24.597
Sorry it took me so
long to get back to you.

01:38:24.599 --> 01:38:28.268
But I really dig the
writing sample you sent.

01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:30.637
I think there's
some potential here.

01:38:30.639 --> 01:38:33.907
Anyway, I'd love to see the
whole "Phoenix, Oregon" book

01:38:33.909 --> 01:38:35.241
if you have it.

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:36.142
Thanks, man.

01:38:47.289 --> 01:38:48.187
Okay.

01:38:52.227 --> 01:38:54.928
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:39:07.075 --> 01:39:08.607
They actually
coincide, so like,

01:39:08.609 --> 01:39:10.142
then there's times we could do
a little something for them.

01:39:10.145 --> 01:39:11.044
Hi, Bobby.

01:39:12.948 --> 01:39:14.347
I quit.

01:39:14.349 --> 01:39:15.548
What?

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:17.717
You're a great
boss, Stacy, truly.

01:39:17.719 --> 01:39:19.519
But I can't work here anymore.

01:39:21.056 --> 01:39:22.555
What are you, wait a,

01:39:22.557 --> 01:39:23.489
wait, you're leaving now?

01:39:23.491 --> 01:39:24.691
You're quitting now?

01:39:24.693 --> 01:39:25.391
You're not even...

01:39:33.201 --> 01:39:35.034
People
need to see this,

01:39:35.036 --> 01:39:36.736
otherwise it's not a book.

01:39:36.738 --> 01:39:38.037
It doesn't count.

01:39:38.039 --> 01:39:40.406
Well, you know what
should really freak you out?

01:39:40.408 --> 01:39:42.308
Getting old, not going
after your dreams

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:43.509
when you had a chance.

01:39:43.511 --> 01:39:45.445
Oh, that's it, bro,
you could roll.

01:39:45.447 --> 01:39:47.013
I remember.

01:39:47.015 --> 01:39:48.281
It's a
completely useless talent.

01:39:48.283 --> 01:39:50.450
Maybe I should learn
how to salsa dance.

01:39:50.452 --> 01:39:52.452
Maybe you
should.

01:39:52.454 --> 01:39:55.088
This place,
it's my destiny, Bobby.

01:39:55.090 --> 01:39:55.989
I know it is.

01:39:59.427 --> 01:40:02.695
You need to take
care of yourself, Bobby.

01:40:02.697 --> 01:40:04.998
I mean, these could be the
best years of your life.

01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.432
Do you realize that?

01:41:11.266 --> 01:41:13.633
Hoffman, what's goin' on?

01:41:13.635 --> 01:41:14.467
Hey.

01:41:14.469 --> 01:41:15.368
Bobby.

01:41:16.237 --> 01:41:17.170
Wow.

01:41:17.172 --> 01:41:18.104
Finally made it in.

01:41:18.106 --> 01:41:20.239
The place feels so different.

01:41:20.241 --> 01:41:21.507
We open in two weeks.

01:41:23.144 --> 01:41:24.243
Is Carlos around?

01:41:24.245 --> 01:41:25.778
Let me go get him.

01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.513
Can I get you a little
somethin', somethin'?

01:41:27.515 --> 01:41:29.215
Oh, just water.

01:41:30.085 --> 01:41:31.184
Come on.

01:41:32.454 --> 01:41:34.087
Go for it.

01:41:34.089 --> 01:41:35.254
All right, thanks, Rudy.

01:41:43.231 --> 01:41:44.363
I hope whatever you're
drinking goes well

01:41:44.365 --> 01:41:47.266
with an Elisa or a Calabrese.

01:41:47.268 --> 01:41:49.168
You're not makin'
pies right now, are ya?

01:41:49.170 --> 01:41:52.338
Oh, yeah, in our new
wood-fired oven as we speak.

01:41:54.209 --> 01:41:55.108
Hold on a sec.

01:41:57.112 --> 01:41:58.478
Tanya.

01:41:58.480 --> 01:41:59.412
It's so good to see you.

01:41:59.414 --> 01:42:01.848
What you got for me?

01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:04.383
You can't beat
Quady North Syrah.

01:42:04.385 --> 01:42:06.319
They sell their
premiere by the bottle

01:42:06.321 --> 01:42:08.421
but their standard by the glass.

01:42:08.423 --> 01:42:09.689
And it's as good
as any mid-range

01:42:09.691 --> 01:42:11.491
from Napa or Santa Barbara.

01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:13.893
I love your palate.

01:42:13.895 --> 01:42:14.727
Right?

01:42:14.729 --> 01:42:17.130
Oh, my god, delicious.

01:42:17.132 --> 01:42:18.264
Hey, Bobby.

01:42:18.266 --> 01:42:19.866
Come try this, bro.

01:42:19.868 --> 01:42:20.766
Ooh.

01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:23.903
Mm, I think my pies gonna
taste so much better

01:42:23.905 --> 01:42:24.737
in this place.

01:42:24.739 --> 01:42:26.172
Yeah.

01:42:26.174 --> 01:42:27.874
Full respect, you were
built for this business.

01:42:27.876 --> 01:42:29.275
Bien gracias.

01:42:29.277 --> 01:42:30.343
Hey, why don't
you stay for dinner?

01:42:30.345 --> 01:42:31.844
It's just familia.

01:42:31.846 --> 01:42:34.547
Marie, Rudy, can you help me
put these tables together?

01:42:37.418 --> 01:42:38.284
What's up?

01:42:43.291 --> 01:42:46.459
Why you lookin' at me like that?

01:42:46.461 --> 01:42:49.362
I didn't expect
to run into you.

01:42:55.403 --> 01:42:59.272
Carlos, I have a few other
stops to make today, so.

01:42:59.274 --> 01:43:00.706
Well, why don't you
stay at least for a slice.

01:43:00.708 --> 01:43:02.475
I mean, see how
my pies translate

01:43:02.477 --> 01:43:04.210
in this new wood-fire oven.

01:43:04.212 --> 01:43:06.312
I'm gonna take a rain check
on that, but keep the bottles.

01:43:06.314 --> 01:43:07.647
- Let me know what you think.
- Okay.

01:43:07.649 --> 01:43:08.781
You got it.

01:43:08.783 --> 01:43:11.250
All right, have a good one.

01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:17.190
What'd you say to her?

01:43:19.194 --> 01:43:20.459
You're really gonna
hold these grudges

01:43:20.461 --> 01:43:21.627
the rest of your life?

01:43:28.336 --> 01:43:30.269
You still want
me to work here?

01:43:30.271 --> 01:43:33.272
With equity to make
up for what happened.

01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:39.412
You don't
have to do that.

01:43:39.414 --> 01:43:40.246
I want to.

01:43:40.248 --> 01:43:41.280
You're my bro.

01:43:43.985 --> 01:43:44.884
Thanks, man.

01:43:51.292 --> 01:43:52.592
Hey!

01:43:52.594 --> 01:43:53.492
Wait.

01:43:54.696 --> 01:43:55.795
Sorry.

01:43:55.797 --> 01:43:58.331
That's not what I meant to say.

01:43:58.333 --> 01:43:59.599
Well, that is what you said.

01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:01.601
And I haven't seen
you in a long time.

01:44:01.603 --> 01:44:03.002
It was weird.

01:44:03.004 --> 01:44:07.373
Yeah, I just got surprised,
and it came out wrong.

01:44:07.375 --> 01:44:11.477
So I don't blame you,

01:44:11.479 --> 01:44:14.780
or Carlos, or aliens.

01:44:14.782 --> 01:44:16.698
I don't even blame
myself anymore,

01:44:16.700 --> 01:44:18.617
mostly because that bowling
alley was the best thing

01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:21.354
to happen to me in a long time,

01:44:21.356 --> 01:44:24.290
working with everybody and
getting to know you, so.

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:31.530
Do you want to come back

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:34.533
and see how that
crust translates?

01:44:34.535 --> 01:44:36.836
It's okay, you don't,
maybe another time.

01:44:36.838 --> 01:44:37.870
No worries.

01:45:00.762 --> 01:45:02.461
Sit down, sit down primos.

01:45:02.463 --> 01:45:03.929
There's more slices coming.

01:45:04.932 --> 01:45:05.898
Wow, Blade.

01:45:07.402 --> 01:45:08.301
Rudy, you got 'em?

01:45:08.303 --> 01:45:09.669
Really good, good.

01:45:11.372 --> 01:45:13.639
Right on time, I knew you guys

01:45:13.641 --> 01:45:14.473
- couldn't resist.
- Hello, I'm just staying

01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:15.675
for a quick slice.

01:45:15.677 --> 01:45:16.909
Oh, come on, come
on, right here.

01:45:16.911 --> 01:45:17.943
I really do have a
lot of meetings today.

01:45:17.945 --> 01:45:19.478
Oh, you're gonna enjoy this.

01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:21.781
I know I'm gonna love it.

01:45:21.783 --> 01:45:24.483
Papa... papa!

01:45:24.485 --> 01:45:25.384
All right.

01:45:26.487 --> 01:45:27.320
I'm ready.

01:45:29.457 --> 01:45:30.990
See, they're very

01:45:32.827 --> 01:45:34.360
I don't wanna hear

01:45:47.375 --> 01:45:48.107
Delicioso.

01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:49.942
That's delicious.

01:45:51.512 --> 01:45:52.111
Salud.

01:45:52.113 --> 01:45:53.512
Salud.

01:46:56.577 --> 01:46:59.111
These instruments
detect the unseen forces

01:46:59.113 --> 01:47:02.615
that swirl around
these distant worlds.

01:47:08.856 --> 01:47:10.790
Life, even
on the outer planets,

01:47:10.792 --> 01:47:12.691
would be extinguished.

01:47:32.847 --> 01:47:35.848
Staring
into the unknown.

01:47:37.852 --> 01:47:38.918
The unknown.
