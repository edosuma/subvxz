<i>"There were on the planet</i>
<i>where the Little Prince lived...</i>

06:27.220 --> 06:29.555
<i>as on all planets...</i>

06:29.931 --> 06:32.558
<i>good plants and bad plants."</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:39.565
"In consequence, there were good
seeds from good plants,

06:39.899 --> 06:44.153
and bad seeds from bad plants."

06:44.821 --> 06:46.823
"But seeds are invisible.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.743
They sleep deep in the heart
of the earth's darkness.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.956
Until someone among them is seized...

06:55.289 --> 06:58.418
with the desire to awaken."

16:50.384 --> 16:52.177
You're too weak. Let me help.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.554
I can manage.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.514
Let me help.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.051
Brothers! He's dead!

17:35.304 --> 17:36.930
He's dead!

17:57.618 --> 18:01.121
O God, forgive our living and our dead...

18:05.084 --> 18:06.960
We should go back to Syria.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.170
No!

18:09.713 --> 18:12.382
At least there you'll be
able to see a doctor.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.345
I won't go. I'm staying!

18:16.428 --> 18:19.264
To die here? You can't want that.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.016
I won't die.

18:22.059 --> 18:24.061
You don't know what you're saying.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.732
-You're delirious
-You don't know!

18:31.068 --> 18:33.362
You don't know Him! Not like I do!

18:33.946 --> 18:35.114
He betrayed you!

18:35.531 --> 18:37.116
You think you're special?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.409
You think you are the chosen one?

18:39.993 --> 18:42.287
Then why aren't you with him?

18:43.288 --> 18:45.582
Because he's in America!
Because he's a fake!

18:45.666 --> 18:47.668
-That's bullshit!
-It's true!

18:48.252 --> 18:50.754
You can't see it.

18:51.088 --> 18:53.632
You can't see it because you're mad!

18:54.466 --> 18:57.553
You can't see it because you love him.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.743
Mommy?

19:21.869 --> 19:23.537
What are you doing, little goose?

19:24.663 --> 19:26.290
Where's Daddy?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.542
He's probably working.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.586
Now come eat your food.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.213
Then why is his car here?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.194
Let me do it!

20:00.532 --> 20:01.950
Uncle Zev!

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
How are you?

20:06.747 --> 20:09.917
-What's up?
-Sorry for showing up unannounced, but...

20:10.918 --> 20:12.836
Go play with Cookie...

20:23.972 --> 20:25.432
I feel stupid.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.768
It's probably nothing. It's just...

21:01.218 --> 21:03.345
His car's been out front
of our house for three days.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.347
They booted his wheels.

21:08.183 --> 21:11.478
I'll put out some feelers for him.
I'm sure it's nothing to worry about.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.523
Thank you, Zev.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.193
Ellie... time to go.

28:42.470 --> 28:43.680
<i>Listen...</i>

28:44.347 --> 28:46.933
This man that has led us here...

28:47.726 --> 28:49.936
he is not the prophet Jesus returned.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.941
-He took advantage of us.
-He turned away Daesh, we all saw it...

28:55.024 --> 28:57.068
We saw the sandstorm...

28:57.193 --> 28:58.695
turn away Daesh.

28:59.362 --> 29:02.699
He has led us to the gate of our enemies.

29:03.283 --> 29:07.370
Tonight, we will leave for Jordan...

29:08.037 --> 29:09.706
for true refuge...

29:09.998 --> 29:15.503
where our Muslim brothers
wait with open arms.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.866
Wanting to live is not a crime.

36:57.882 --> 37:00.718
I promised my father
his name would live on.

37:07.642 --> 37:08.684
Read to me.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.111
<i>"'Were they not satisfied</i>
<i>where they were?' </i>

37:21.280 --> 37:24.492
<i>asked the Little Prince..."</i>

37:29.121 --> 37:33.459
"'No one is ever satisfied
where he is...'

37:34.085 --> 37:36.629
said the switchman."

38:16.961 --> 38:19.922
<i>"'All men have the stars...</i>

38:31.058 --> 38:34.770
...but they are not the same things
for different people."

38:40.609 --> 38:45.364
<i>"For some, who are travelers,</i>
<i>the stars are guides..."</i>

38:47.491 --> 38:51.871
<i>"For others they are no more</i>
<i>than little lights in the sky..."</i>

38:53.497 --> 39:00.463
<i>"But you...</i>
<i>you alone will have the stars</i>

39:00.629 --> 39:03.299
<i>as no one else has them."'</i>
