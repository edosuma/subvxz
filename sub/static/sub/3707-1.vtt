(CHUCKLING)

00:22.223 --> 00:24.792
I'm sorry, Mrs. Novack,
but, you know,

00:24.825 --> 00:27.328
dogs aren't allowed
inside the bank.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.429
Oh.

00:28.462 --> 00:32.400
He's so little.
He won't hurt anyone.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.802
I just want to get
into my box.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.274
We'll be quick.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.776
Yeah, good.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.014
BEN: Narcy always had
a way with men.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.790
MAN: Excuse me.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.759
Mrs. Novack.
Yes?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.461
Uh, I'm terribly sorry.

01:00.494 --> 01:03.597
But Thomas was unaware
that your name is not
on the signature card.

01:03.631 --> 01:07.034
Your husband needs
to be with you
to get into the box.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.536
Oh. Don't be silly.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.571
I'll send Ben over
to sign the card

01:10.604 --> 01:12.873
just as soon as he wakes up
from his nap.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.108
I promise.

01:14.908 --> 01:19.079
That's me. Ben Jr.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.815
Probably better
to take this one back
to the beginning.

01:28.456 --> 01:30.524
This is where I grew up,

01:30.558 --> 01:33.594
the legendary
Fontainebleau Hotel,

01:33.627 --> 01:36.230
paradise on the sand
in Miami Beach.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.699
It was Dad's.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.534
He built it
from the ground up.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.104
Pretty swank, don't you think?

01:44.138 --> 01:46.407
The Fontainebleau
was the place to see

01:46.440 --> 01:48.409
and be seen.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.943
And it was ours.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.448
Anyone who was anyone
stayed here.

01:54.482 --> 01:57.518
Dad said,
"Build a grand stage,

01:57.551 --> 02:00.521
"and anyone who enters
will play their part."

02:00.554 --> 02:02.256
Sinatra stayed here.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.857
Elvis stayed here.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.460
Freaking James Bond
stayed here.

02:07.595 --> 02:11.732
JFK stayed in suite 1784.

02:13.201 --> 02:17.104
Marilyn stayed in 1782.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.940
This was home,

02:21.409 --> 02:24.712
and Dad, Ben Sr., was king,

02:24.745 --> 02:29.850
and Mom, Bernice,
was the queen
of the Fontainebleau.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.686
I guess I'd be the prince
in this story.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.422
(GASPS) Oh!

02:34.455 --> 02:37.325
Happy birthday, Ben-o.

02:37.358 --> 02:40.528
My parents would use
any excuse to throw a bash.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.298
Dad. Dad. Dad.

02:45.132 --> 02:46.534
Hold on a sec, buddy.

02:46.567 --> 02:49.637
One second, Benny, okay?
The grown-ups are talking.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.905
BEN: And my sixth birthday
was a pretty good one.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.074
Yeah, why don't you
go up to your room,
read some of your comics?

02:54.107 --> 02:56.176
BERNICE: Why don't you
get some of your
birthday cake, honey?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.078
BEN: Hey, my folks had a lot
on their plates.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.882
I mean, who wants
a six-year-old kid
butting in, you know?

03:01.915 --> 03:05.919
I kind of figured
this is where I got
my taste for everything.

03:05.953 --> 03:09.790
I mean, it was right
in front of me,
everywhere, eye high.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.826
Ass, booze, drugs, all of it.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.731
I was raised on TV
and comic books.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.100
I mean, my life was already
a kind of fantasy

03:20.133 --> 03:22.303
with kings and queens
and movie stars.

03:22.336 --> 03:25.406
So why not add
a superhero into the mix?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.441
Batman was my favorite.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.077
I don't know why.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.713
Maybe it was the lonely,
rich kid thing,

03:32.746 --> 03:34.648
maybe I just liked the car.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.120
WOMAN: Lay 'em down, ladies.

03:40.153 --> 03:44.224
BEN: I got my real
education backstage
at the Boom-Boom Room.

03:44.258 --> 03:49.830
I guess all that's missing
from this story is the girl,
the damsel in distress,

03:49.863 --> 03:52.199
and the villain,
but we'll get to that.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.322
* What is it
when you don't know

04:14.355 --> 04:19.593
* The weight of the world
is beginning to kill you

04:19.627 --> 04:22.430
* Honesty will remind you

04:22.463 --> 04:26.700

that come out of your mouth

04:26.734 --> 04:30.170

04:30.203 --> 04:34.308
* Got your foot in the door
with fire in your soul

04:34.342 --> 04:36.877
* And you feel like
you know too much

04:36.910 --> 04:39.647
* You know nothing at all

04:42.650 --> 04:46.253
* Come on, come on,
just look at yourself

04:46.286 --> 04:50.257
* Well, you made up your mind,
it's bad for your health

04:50.290 --> 04:54.027
* There's a four letter word
that makes you feel better

04:54.061 --> 04:58.732
* But you don't understand
the damage you've done

05:11.545 --> 05:14.281

05:38.739 --> 05:42.342
WOMAN: All right,
let's give it up
for Kitty in the middle.

05:42.376 --> 05:46.514
And that's Eva on the left
and Candice on the right.

06:05.265 --> 06:06.266
Drink?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.503
Can't. I'm on the job.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.772
What's your name? I'm Ben.

06:12.406 --> 06:13.441
Kitty.

06:15.409 --> 06:18.045
What's your name
when you have
your clothes on?

06:18.078 --> 06:19.580
(CHUCKLES)

06:19.613 --> 06:22.015
You are not gonna find out
in a place like this.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.751
Really?

06:23.784 --> 06:26.386
Well, then, let's go.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.125
It ain't gonna be that easy.

06:43.036 --> 06:47.675
BEN: Her name was Narcisa
Veliz Pacheco. Narcy.

06:55.483 --> 06:58.919
She was my princess,
my damsel,

07:00.387 --> 07:01.789
my Catwoman.

07:28.582 --> 07:32.152
And I was hooked.

07:32.185 --> 07:37.525
She was like crack
or cigarettes or whatever else
you can get addicted to.

07:39.359 --> 07:41.929
I had to have Narcy.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.934
It was the craziest
foreplay ever.

07:46.967 --> 07:52.339
For weeks, I'd go to watch
her dance, pay for booze,
for lap dances,

07:52.372 --> 07:55.042
and she still wouldn't let me
take her out.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.613
It's amazing how much stuff
that woman could take off

07:59.647 --> 08:01.815
without showing me anything.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.629
Just like Catwoman,
she was a mystery.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.466
Who was she behind the mask?

08:19.499 --> 08:22.803
I was gonna keep
coming back to find out.

08:22.836 --> 08:29.076
(MUSIC PLAYING)
* All I am saying is love's
got me waiting around

08:31.344 --> 08:35.783
* And you're nowhere
to be found *

08:43.090 --> 08:44.592
Good morning, May.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.794
It's almost 4:00.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.029
Night shift
at the restaurant.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.732
You don't have to call it
a restaurant.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.101
They serve food there.
(CHUCKLES)

08:55.035 --> 08:56.136
Mmm.

08:57.938 --> 08:59.372
How's school?

08:59.406 --> 09:00.774
How's the restaurant?

09:06.279 --> 09:13.053
May, you know everything I do,
I do for us, to make us money,

09:13.086 --> 09:16.389
maybe get you
to a better school,
send you to college.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.458
I know.

09:20.594 --> 09:25.065
When I worked at the shop,
I made $6 an hour.

09:25.098 --> 09:28.936
Dancing, I can make
$500 a night.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.277
A nice guy has been
coming in.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.614
He wants to date me.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.983
Nice guys don't go
to that kind
of restaurant, Mom.

09:45.352 --> 09:46.620
Hmm.

09:48.856 --> 09:49.990
(LAUGHING)

09:54.662 --> 09:56.630
Hey, you want
to take a ride?

09:56.664 --> 09:57.765
No, thank you.

10:03.270 --> 10:05.673
Hey, I asked you
a question back there.
No, come on.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.207
Come on, come here.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.942
No, don't touch me!
Come on!

10:08.976 --> 10:10.110
Get off! Ahhh!

10:11.544 --> 10:13.046
Help! (GRUNTING)
Come here!

10:14.815 --> 10:15.949
(CHOKING)

10:19.086 --> 10:21.054

10:29.429 --> 10:31.832
You ever bother her again,
I'll kill you!

10:32.565 --> 10:33.834
(GRUNTING)

10:36.236 --> 10:38.438
All right, come on.
Let's go.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.307
Let's go, let's go.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.710
I got you.
I got you. I got you.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.613
Nice car.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.919
This is the one
I rescue the damsels in.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.254
Are you trying to save me?

11:12.405 --> 11:14.842
You own
the freaking Batmobile?

11:15.608 --> 11:16.910
You like it?

11:18.645 --> 11:20.180
Nice bat cave.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.582
I actually have
three more of them.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.251
What do you do
with all this stuff?

11:24.284 --> 11:26.954
What do you mean
what do I do with it?
I collect it.

11:26.987 --> 11:30.791
It's actually the second
largest collection of Batman
memorabilia in the world.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.560
Oh, she's cool.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.396
BEN: Catwoman.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.834
Gets her information
from men so she can use it
in her robberies.

11:40.868 --> 11:43.403
She's got a love-hate
relationship with Batman.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.639
He thinks he can reform her.

11:47.841 --> 11:50.043
He needs the whip.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.912
Third drawer on the left.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.248
You are a bad boy.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.184
Looking for a bad girl.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.591
Oh.

(CAR ENGINE STARTS)

12:26.679 --> 12:28.448
(ENGINE REVVING)

12:37.891 --> 12:42.395
* Ah, ah,
what is my sexuality?

12:42.429 --> 12:46.533
* People try to tell me
who to be

12:46.566 --> 12:48.902
* All I know is what

12:48.936 --> 12:54.341
* I say she, she make me
crazy, crazy, crazy,
crazy, crazy

12:54.374 --> 12:58.145
* We be hangin' out
in the room that's when
she'd bring me up on the door

12:58.178 --> 13:00.247
* I wanna run my hands
through her dark hair

13:00.280 --> 13:03.416
* I wanna rock
and fall in love

13:06.753 --> 13:10.557
* As you can see
you wanna take my clothes off

13:10.590 --> 13:14.794
* Do you feel it too?
I wanna take your clothes off

13:14.828 --> 13:18.565
* As you can see
you wanna take my clothes off

13:18.598 --> 13:22.402
* Volunteer the things
I wanna do

13:26.173 --> 13:29.009
* High sexuality

13:30.710 --> 13:33.680
What are you
waiting for, Batman?

13:52.933 --> 13:55.735
Why don't you quit your job
and let me take care of you?

13:59.139 --> 14:01.374
We haven't even gone
on a date yet.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.677
This wasn't a date?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.183
You're too beautiful
and smart to be stripping.

14:11.784 --> 14:14.287
Trying to reform me, Batman?

14:14.321 --> 14:18.058
I am trying to keep
you all to myself.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.967
Um...

14:27.935 --> 14:29.602
I have a daughter.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.907
Great.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.809
I love kids.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.711
I was one once myself.

14:40.347 --> 14:46.719
Besides, I have 5,000 toys

14:46.753 --> 14:48.688
and nobody to play with.

14:51.524 --> 14:56.329
All right, May,
I officially deem
you my first mate,

14:56.363 --> 14:59.599
and your duties include
repelling any invaders,

14:59.632 --> 15:03.336
interlopers, pirates
or other miscreants.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.955
I know that I haven't known
your mom very long,

15:21.989 --> 15:25.592
but I am very serious
about her.

15:27.194 --> 15:28.795
You met her
at a strip club.

15:32.465 --> 15:37.937
Look, why don't you and I make
a bet whether this lasts.

15:37.971 --> 15:41.874
You're, like,
a zillionaire or something.
I don't even get allowance.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.944
Okay, I will bet you

15:44.978 --> 15:48.848
my detective
comic book number 27.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.150
A comic book?

15:50.183 --> 15:52.285
It's Batman's
first appearance.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.021
There's less than 100
in the world.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.123
It's worth about $1 million.

15:57.457 --> 16:02.429
But what do I get
if you lose?

16:02.462 --> 16:05.198
You get my mom.
That's prize enough.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.466
Deal.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.179
* Hey, little honey,
I've got the money

16:19.212 --> 16:20.647
* Let's blow it all

16:20.680 --> 16:22.315
Mama.
Benny.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.750
You look so handsome.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.918
Almost respectable.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.755
Mom, this is Narcy.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.990
Hi.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.926
You must be May.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.328
Benny told me
you were a pretty girl,

16:35.362 --> 16:37.997
but he was grossly
understating the facts.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.267
I'm Narcy.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.235
(BARKING)

16:42.269 --> 16:45.505
He doesn't like strangers.
Go, Bubbe.

16:45.538 --> 16:47.840
Narcy.
That's an interesting name.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.142
It's short for Narcisa.

16:49.176 --> 16:52.679
Ah. Narcisa. The dancer.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.049
Lovely. Come in.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.054
MAY: Wow. This place is huge!

17:01.088 --> 17:03.790
You have a very
lovely home, Mrs. Novack.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.692
Yes, let me take you
on a tour.

17:05.724 --> 17:06.959
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:06.992 --> 17:09.695
You keep the old lady busy.
I'll hit the silver.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.896
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

17:10.930 --> 17:14.267
Dolores, we'll be ready
for dinner in a few minutes

17:14.300 --> 17:17.604
Six years curating
for the Museo De Arte
De Barcelona.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.073
I'm fluent
in five languages.
Come, sweetie.

17:20.107 --> 17:21.108
Oh.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.546
MAY: Why do you have
all these pictures?

17:26.579 --> 17:30.383
Well, that used to belong
to us until
Benny's father passed.

17:32.319 --> 17:34.854
Come, you see
that grand piano there?

17:34.887 --> 17:37.124
That was a gift
from Frank Sinatra.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.892
What happened
with your mom?

17:39.926 --> 17:42.495
She's slow to warm up,

17:42.529 --> 17:46.433
and one day,
she's gonna love you
as much as I do.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.002
Come on, you two,
have a look at the pool.
There's a waterfall.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.208
We can make it short
if you're paying
by the hour.

17:57.610 --> 17:58.945
(NARCY SCREAMING)

18:00.780 --> 18:02.682
Narcy, open the door.
No!

18:03.583 --> 18:06.018
(NARCY SPEAKING SPANISH)

18:06.052 --> 18:07.187
What is she saying?

18:07.220 --> 18:09.656
She called Bernice a bitch.

18:09.689 --> 18:13.760
All right,
if you don't open the door,
I'm breaking it down.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.297
It's a hollow-core
fiberboard door.
I can bust it with my pinky.

18:17.330 --> 18:21.033
One.
Did you see how that
bitch looked at me, huh?

18:21.067 --> 18:23.270
Where was Batman, huh?

18:23.303 --> 18:26.373
She's like your
Kryptonite or something.

18:26.406 --> 18:29.909
That's Superman.
Batman doesn't care
about Kryptonite.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.545
Two. Look, just open it up.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.814
I have something
very important
I want to tell you.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.916
I don't want
to talk to you.

18:36.949 --> 18:40.052
All right, your landlord
isn't gonna like this. Three.

18:40.086 --> 18:41.087
(BANGING)
Ah!

18:45.725 --> 18:48.261
Narcy, will you marry me?

18:48.295 --> 18:50.330
Or do I need
to break my foot?

18:56.303 --> 18:57.937
What did you say?

18:59.172 --> 19:00.940
Will you marry me, Narcy?

19:03.943 --> 19:05.878
(LAUGHING)

19:12.051 --> 19:13.786
Told you I'd win our bet.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.366
(CROWD CHEERING)

19:33.873 --> 19:36.142
John is already so hammered.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.511
BEN: He had way
too much champagne.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.847
Whoa, no, no.
Thanks again.

19:40.880 --> 19:44.083
I thought a Batman-themed
Bar Mitzvah was tacky,

19:44.116 --> 19:47.153
but this really can't compare.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.955
It was his idea.

19:48.988 --> 19:51.824
Well, we were gonna
have it at the strip club,
but that food is terrible.

19:51.858 --> 19:55.662
Yeah, well,
congratulations to you.

19:55.695 --> 20:00.166
I hope you'll both
be very happy
and have a good lawyer.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.869
Oh, but we do.
They helped us
with the pre-nup.

20:02.902 --> 20:04.170
Her idea.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.540
Well, that's very romantic.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.043
Will you just excuse me
for one second?

20:12.479 --> 20:13.813
Cheers.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.285
All right, come on.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.088
What are you drinking,
shots? No?

20:22.121 --> 20:25.525
Don Julio Blanco for me.
A virgin margarita for her.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.895
We're gonna be a family.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.931
I want you to come
to me for anything.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.600
Except history.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.101
I suck at history.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.671
To the Novacks.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.011
Ben, you remember
my brother Cristobal?

20:45.044 --> 20:46.245
Hey.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.847
You take good care
of my Narcy.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.555
Congratulations.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.789
BEN: And that was that.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.225
Batman married his Catwoman,

20:59.258 --> 21:02.695
and like anything
that's both amazing
and addicting

21:02.729 --> 21:07.634
and possibly very bad
for you, it was great.

21:09.068 --> 21:11.904
Look! This is the one
I was telling you about!

21:12.939 --> 21:15.041
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

21:16.275 --> 21:18.445
Hold it up.
It'll look bigger.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.179
Yeah!

21:20.212 --> 21:25.217
BEN: Years went by,
put May through school.

21:25.251 --> 21:26.953
Maybe I wasn't
the perfect husband,

21:26.986 --> 21:29.656
but I took good care
of the family,

21:29.689 --> 21:32.224
food on the table,
roof over the head.

21:33.259 --> 21:35.395
Everything was good.

21:35.428 --> 21:38.331
We were living
the American dream-ish.

22:03.523 --> 22:04.591
I got to go.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.597
Uh-oh. Look at you!

22:50.102 --> 22:51.170
How was your flight?

22:51.203 --> 22:53.239
(SIGHS) I need to get
a Batplane.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.608
What's this?

22:57.143 --> 22:58.210
Powdered sugar.

22:59.011 --> 23:00.012
Oh.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.715
What's this?

23:04.684 --> 23:05.785
Chocolate.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.089
Mmm.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.592
I'm gonna take
a quick shower.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.561
Mmm. Are you hungry
for lunch?

23:14.594 --> 23:15.828
What are you making?

23:15.862 --> 23:17.229
It's a surprise.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.100
A surprise.
Speaking of which...

23:24.303 --> 23:25.304
(GASPS)

23:27.039 --> 23:28.475
(LAUGHS)

23:29.942 --> 23:32.111
Look at the size
of these diamonds.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.047
It's not even my birthday.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.215
You like 'em?

23:36.248 --> 23:37.784
I love them.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.552
It's just to show
that I was thinking about you,

23:39.586 --> 23:42.254
and to thank you
for putting up
with such a workaholic,

23:42.288 --> 23:44.056
absent, hot-tempered,

23:44.090 --> 23:45.858
sex-crazed,
good-for-nothing husband.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.660
My pleasure.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.672
I'm just gonna go
take a quick shower.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.645
Okay.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.579
Who's Sandy?

24:40.379 --> 24:42.014
Hmm?

24:42.048 --> 24:45.151
I found this in the pocket
of your jacket.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.620
(TOWEL SNAPS)
Ouch! Ow!

24:47.654 --> 24:49.255
Don't you dare lie to me.

24:49.288 --> 24:51.791
I don't know what that is.
I've never seen that before.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.560
(TOWEL SNAPS)
Ouch!

24:55.061 --> 24:57.396
That could have been
in there for a year.

24:57.429 --> 24:59.398
I wore that jacket
to Chuck's wedding.

24:59.431 --> 25:03.102
Don't bullshit me.
This is a goddamn bar napkin.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.105
Is this a strip joint?

25:06.138 --> 25:08.174
You were screwing
some stripper on the side?

25:08.207 --> 25:09.876
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

25:09.909 --> 25:12.478
Where do you think
I meet clients?
I meet them in bars!

25:12.511 --> 25:14.480
It's probably
a client's number.

25:14.513 --> 25:17.416
You know what?
I'm gonna call her.
I'm gonna call that whore.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.152
No, you're not.
Yes.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.655
No, you are not.
Stop it. Stop it.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.424
Okay, no. All right.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.628
I was drunk,
and she came on to me,
and I took the number...

25:28.661 --> 25:30.597
You liar!
I shouldn't have...

25:34.967 --> 25:36.002
Narcy!

25:37.469 --> 25:38.537
Narcy!

25:40.272 --> 25:41.841
Get away from me.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.010
You think you can go around
screwing other women,

25:44.043 --> 25:46.378
and come back
with some jewelry,
and everything will be fine?

25:47.246 --> 25:48.715
What are these, a bribe?

25:48.748 --> 25:50.149
Look, I am sorry, all right?

25:50.182 --> 25:51.618
Look, I love you.

25:51.651 --> 25:53.385
Bullshit.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.855
If you love me,
you don't go around
screwing other women.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.825
Look, sometimes I go
too far, okay?

25:58.858 --> 26:02.428
But I've never pretended
to be anything
other than what I am.

26:02.461 --> 26:05.197
I mean, come on.
We met at a strip club.

26:07.466 --> 26:08.467

I'm sorry, Benny.
Oh, my God.

26:28.554 --> 26:32.358
You are the craziest
bitch I've ever met.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.729

who drives me crazy.

for Salazar.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.494
Oh, good, good. Thanks.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.729
What the hell
happened to you?

27:09.762 --> 27:11.430
Oh, I forgot to duck.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.033
You've been with Mom
for this long and you still
haven't learned?

27:14.066 --> 27:15.567
Yeah.

27:15.601 --> 27:16.602
You need more ice?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.205
No, no, no.
I'm good.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.372
I closed the Sheraton deal.

27:20.406 --> 27:21.407
No!

you were coming in today.

What happened to you?

27:38.758 --> 27:39.826
It's nothing.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.560
You should see the other guy.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.329
Oh, my God.
It's fine.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.965
Hey, got a big client
coming in today.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.067
Is Narcy coming in
for this big meeting?

27:48.100 --> 27:51.503
Uh, I do not know.
We had a disagreement.

27:51.537 --> 27:53.572
Oh. Well, what else is new?

27:53.605 --> 27:56.275
Did she do this
to you, Benny?
Mom, don't worry about it.

27:56.308 --> 28:00.346
But I am worried, Benny.
I've been worried
since the day you met her.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.815
Mom, every marriage
has problems.

28:05.818 --> 28:06.919
Hello, husband.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.024
Mother. To what do
we owe the pleasure?

28:12.058 --> 28:14.693
I'm just checking on
the welfare of my son.

in five minutes.

Mom, go get a cup of coffee,
and we'll talk later.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.202
You have blood
on your shirt, baby.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.871
A little spot right there.

28:26.472 --> 28:29.108
Come. Take it off.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.477
Let me get it out
before the stain sets.

28:41.453 --> 28:45.624
Ben, I'm sorry about before.
I just...

28:47.459 --> 28:48.761
You hurt me.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.032
I don't know
what gets into me.

28:53.065 --> 28:55.968
All I want is for things
to be good.

I just want us
to be happy.

I just want to love you.

to love me like before.

Moms usually are.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.188
But what she could
never understand,

what no one could
ever understand,

Great.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.390
I got this.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.326
NARCY: Vamos?

31:12.771 --> 31:14.506
This is assault.
It's a crime.

31:14.540 --> 31:17.109
You should file charges
and for divorce as well.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.577
Mom, not now.

31:26.818 --> 31:30.189
BEN: The nature of a cat
is its unpredictability.

31:30.222 --> 31:33.092
And with Narcy,
you never knew what to expect.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.576
Yes, a woman, she just fell...

31:53.179 --> 31:54.180
Mom?

31:54.947 --> 31:56.882
Mom. You'll be okay.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.952
It's okay. It's okay.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.136
You didn't answer
your phone.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.504
NARCY: I was busy.

32:26.012 --> 32:27.413
My mother's in the hospital.

32:29.381 --> 32:30.983
What?

32:31.017 --> 32:32.318
Is she going
to be all right?

32:34.286 --> 32:36.955
They put a tube
down through her throat
into her stomach.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.991
They're running tests.
She's resting.

32:39.591 --> 32:40.626
Where were you?

32:41.893 --> 32:43.229
I was working.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.296
For nine hours?

32:45.631 --> 32:47.099
What happened to her, Ben?

32:53.405 --> 32:54.806
She thinks you poisoned her.

32:56.675 --> 32:58.977
What are you talking about?

32:59.011 --> 33:02.281
Did you have anything
to do with this?

33:15.994 --> 33:18.264
What are you doing?
I'm leaving.

Did you or did you not
poison my mother?

33:31.477 --> 33:36.615
Your mother,
her royal freaking highness,
is an old lady.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.584
Old ladies get sick.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.520
Shit happens.

33:41.553 --> 33:44.423
I know what she says
about me behind my back.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.626
And you dare ask me
if I poisoned her?

33:47.659 --> 33:51.330
That bitch has been
poisoning you
against me since we met.

Why can't you just tell me
that you didn't do it?

of the incident

Where were you

At home,
overseeing the beating
of my husband.

38:29.174 --> 38:32.411
Mrs. Novack, we've explained
your rights to you.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.746
You are not obligated
to speak to us.

38:34.780 --> 38:39.250
I know, I know,
but I want to clear up
this little misunderstanding.

38:39.284 --> 38:43.121
Then you are willing
to admit to the allegations
made by the victim?

38:43.154 --> 38:45.290
The victim?

38:45.323 --> 38:47.258
He does like to play
that role, doesn't he?

38:47.292 --> 38:49.227
So, for the record,
you're stating
that you did have

38:49.260 --> 38:50.562
your husband tied up
and beat?

38:50.596 --> 38:51.697
At gunpoint.

38:51.730 --> 38:52.964
At gunpoint.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.734
Mmm-hmm.
And stole his $370,000?

38:55.767 --> 38:57.536
Stole?

38:57.569 --> 38:59.304
I didn't steal anything.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.572
Then where's his money?

39:00.606 --> 39:01.840
Right here.

39:06.645 --> 39:07.679
Look.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.248
So you did steal it.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.751
I took it,
but it's all going back.

39:12.784 --> 39:15.353
Just because you bring
it back doesn't mean
you didn't steal it.

39:15.387 --> 39:17.088
We can still prosecute you.

39:17.122 --> 39:20.626
Sure, if Benny says
it was stolen,

39:20.659 --> 39:23.462
if he presses charges,

39:23.495 --> 39:24.963
but he won't do that.

He won't.

to put himself in some
very compromising positions.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.719
And the things he does to me,

39:47.753 --> 39:52.090
oh, my, it's addictive.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.995
We like it rough.

I think half the time
we have arguments
just for the makeup sex.

40:05.036 --> 40:08.006
To keep it interesting, well,

40:08.039 --> 40:11.009
you have to push it
a little further sometimes,

40:11.042 --> 40:15.080
and sometimes
a little further

40:15.113 --> 40:19.317
can be scary at first.

Sometimes a little
further can be dead.

40:28.093 --> 40:30.462
MAN: Ben,
if you don't prosecute,

40:30.496 --> 40:32.598
the police will drop the case
and Narcy will walk.

40:32.631 --> 40:35.801
And if I do prosecute,
then she causes a scandal,

40:35.834 --> 40:39.505
and every paper in Florida
will write about our sex life.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.874
I mean, I run
a $100 million business.

40:42.908 --> 40:46.444
I can't have people
thinking that I'm some
sort of a freak.

40:46.478 --> 40:50.381
I mean, not, you know,
the general public.

40:50.415 --> 40:54.653
Well, I guess you'll just
have to choose between
your reputation or your life.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.454
Stop being so melodramatic.

40:56.488 --> 41:01.259
Look, it's the first time
she's ever done anything
like this.

41:01.292 --> 41:04.596
Do you know what my wife does
when she gets angry?

41:04.630 --> 41:06.264
She shops.
Your point?

41:06.297 --> 41:09.367
My point, I don't want
to read about you
in the obituary column.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.941
Even if I did go to court,
it would be my word
against hers.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.877
Yes, but you're a credible,
respectable guy

41:18.910 --> 41:20.979
with a face that looks
like a punching bag,

41:21.012 --> 41:22.247
and she's
a gold-digging whore.

41:22.280 --> 41:23.549
Hey! Hey.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.184
That's my wife.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.753
You're not serious.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.966
BEN: Finally,
I was starting to believe,

41:40.999 --> 41:44.302
like everyone else,
that I had to get out.

The first lesson in dealing
with a wild animal,
they can smell fear.

42:08.193 --> 42:09.828
I'm glad you came.

42:10.896 --> 42:13.732
Is this about us
or the money?

42:15.701 --> 42:19.304
I know what you told the cops.
That was no game.
I could have been killed.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.309
If you think you can pull
something like that

42:24.342 --> 42:26.144
and just get away with it...

42:29.547 --> 42:32.283
Other people
can't understand us, Benny,

42:33.084 --> 42:34.920
the way we love each other,

42:36.487 --> 42:40.959
the way we hurt each other,
the games we play.

42:43.595 --> 42:47.365
I can't leave you
any more than
you can't leave me.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.802
We are a mess, huh?

42:52.771 --> 42:57.275
I know you hate me now,
but you also love me.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.578
Admit it, Benny.

43:02.047 --> 43:04.015
It turns you on,
doesn't it?

43:10.689 --> 43:12.624
Are you afraid of me, Benny?

43:26.805 --> 43:31.142
BEN: The problem was
Narcy was Narcy,

43:31.176 --> 43:33.444
and I was who I was.

43:38.316 --> 43:40.786
BERNICE: She belongs
in prison.

43:40.819 --> 43:44.555
She returned the files, Mom,
and the money, most of it.

43:44.589 --> 43:46.057
We have an agreement.

43:46.958 --> 43:48.894
What is wrong with you?

43:48.927 --> 43:50.595
I don't know
what to tell you, okay?

43:50.628 --> 43:54.766
Look, the heart wants
what it wants, okay?

43:54.800 --> 43:58.670
We both love each other,
and, you know,
we're both a little crazy.

43:59.237 --> 44:00.972
No shit.

44:01.006 --> 44:05.510
She knows she screwed up.
Things are gonna be better.

44:05.543 --> 44:10.481
You are delusional
and she's a psychopath.
You both need help.

44:10.515 --> 44:12.217
We're seeing
a couples' therapist.

44:12.250 --> 44:15.821
You don't need
a therapist, Ben.
You need a hostage negotiator.

44:23.729 --> 44:25.931
I'm really worried
about them.

44:25.964 --> 44:27.632
Yeah, you should be.

44:29.935 --> 44:33.238
Benny didn't have
much of a childhood.

44:33.271 --> 44:37.976
He was always surrounded
by adults and showgirls.

44:38.009 --> 44:40.311
He was there
when I kicked his father
out of the suite

44:40.345 --> 44:42.714
when I caught him cheating.

44:42.748 --> 44:49.087
He was there when his father
hired detectives to follow me
and a singer out of the club.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.255
MAY: Sounds familiar.

44:50.288 --> 44:51.356
Yeah.

44:56.762 --> 44:59.330
But I still love
Benny's father,

44:59.364 --> 45:05.436
even after the divorce,
after the bankruptcy,
after the bimbos.

45:05.470 --> 45:08.439
I mean, were any of them
in the hospital
as he lay dying?

45:09.707 --> 45:12.043
I was by his side
till his last breath.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.714
I think what I'm trying
to say is,

45:16.748 --> 45:20.251
it's possible,
despite all the madness,

45:20.285 --> 45:24.790
that your mom and Benny
love each other very much

45:24.823 --> 45:28.359
in their own
deeply weird way.

45:30.829 --> 45:32.230
That's what I'm afraid of.

45:34.465 --> 45:37.002
(HAMMERING)

45:37.035 --> 45:40.571
BEN: Look,
I'm a screwed-up guy,
always was.

45:40.605 --> 45:45.710
I like fast cars
and crazy girls,
and that was her superpower.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.013
I could have
married Betty Crocker,

45:48.046 --> 45:52.250
but Betty Crocker
doesn't stir my batter,
if you know what I'm saying.

45:52.283 --> 45:56.087
I guess the thing is,
with people like me and Narcy,

45:56.121 --> 45:58.890
it's always
gonna blow to hell.

45:58.924 --> 46:00.859
It's just a matter of when.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.728
NARCY: His mother?

46:25.984 --> 46:27.218
Narcy?

46:35.393 --> 46:36.828
Hello?

46:46.972 --> 46:48.173
Hello?

47:07.625 --> 47:09.327
What?

47:10.328 --> 47:12.497
We're gonna make a mess.

47:12.530 --> 47:13.831
What are you doing?

47:14.765 --> 47:16.801
I'm not gonna do anything.

We got to wait
for the medical examiner
to do the autopsy.

50:42.340 --> 50:45.476
Do you know if your mother
had anybody over last night?

50:45.510 --> 50:49.080
It looks like maybe
she was having
some kind of party.

50:49.114 --> 50:51.015
No, my mom always said,
"The only people

50:51.048 --> 50:52.950
"worth spending
time with were dead."

There are
four martini glasses

50:56.221 --> 50:58.289
and an empty bottle
of white wine.

51:09.867 --> 51:11.769
My mother hated white wine,

51:14.239 --> 51:16.407
and she was convinced
that she was poisoned.

51:21.946 --> 51:23.714
I spoke to the hospital.

there was nothing unusual
in that tox report.

you were here.

in person.

has been ruled an accident.

53:39.250 --> 53:40.518
An accident?

53:40.551 --> 53:42.453
It looks like
she slipped and fell

getting out of her car,
tried to get up,

53:45.656 --> 53:48.092
but kept falling
and slipping.
She broke her teeth.

53:48.125 --> 53:50.227

She broke her ribs.

that she's fallen.

53:57.902 --> 54:01.138
She was hospitalized
just a couple of weeks ago

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.191
Dad always rolled
with lots of cash.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:49.725
He was always waiting for

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:54.029
that mint 1940

to walk through his door.

01:08:54.598 --> 01:08:55.799

if your father
had any enemies?

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:02.839
Um...

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.974
I guess he had some
people that didn't like

01:09:05.008 --> 01:09:07.010
the way he handled
himself sometimes.

01:09:09.446 --> 01:09:11.747
I'm so sorry.
Just one minute,
May, okay?

Yes?

01:09:16.019 --> 01:09:20.857
I was just talking to May,
and given the brutality
of this crime,

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:24.027
I'd like to assign
an officer to you
and your daughter,

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.630

just for a few days,

handle on all of this.

would hurt me or May?

I think it's gonna be
the best for me and for May.

Okay, I can have someone
assigned to help us out.
