WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.293
The human heart is a giant muscle

00:02.419 --> 00:05.713
squeezing or contracting
over 60 times each minute.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.423
That's 3,600...

00:07.549 --> 00:10.677
At this point,
your blood is a deep purple

00:10.803 --> 00:13.680
because it's just finished
dropping off oxygen

00:13.806 --> 00:15.306
for all the parts of your body.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.394
Come on, follow me.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.189
Come on.

00:26.777 --> 00:27.902
Ian.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.279
I have a question
and I need to go to the bathroom.

00:30.406 --> 00:31.989
Which would you like to do first?

00:32.825 --> 00:33.658
The question.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.077
- Okay.
- Where's the bathroom?

00:37.246 --> 00:38.830
Who knows where the bathroom is?

00:38.956 --> 00:39.956
I do.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.624
Go with Ian to the bathroom.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.750
I don't have to go.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.378
We're not at school,
nobody goes anywhere by themselves.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.296
- Why?
- In case you get lost.

00:47.423 --> 00:49.006
Or in case somebody kidnaps us.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.509
If somebody kidnaps Ian,
they'll kidnap me, too.

00:51.635 --> 00:52.802
I want to stay with the class.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.262
Michael, go with Ian...

00:55.514 --> 00:56.556
Do you need help?

00:56.682 --> 00:57.849
I need you to find a grown-up.

00:57.975 --> 00:58.933
Is the baby coming?

01:00.144 --> 01:02.228
- Who should I take with me?
- You're fine.

01:02.354 --> 01:05.064
Go to the front desk
or find a security guard.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.941
I really have to pee.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.319
Oh, God.

01:10.696 --> 01:13.823
Is the baby coming?
I don't know how to do this.

01:14.116 --> 01:15.783
Are you okay, Ian?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.160
Yeah. Sure.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.789
I don't think you are.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.335
You're bleeding.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.548
Help!

01:31.049 --> 01:32.216
Help!

02:29.274 --> 02:30.942
- $20.
- Call.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.277
You'll call anything.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.571
My stack is bigger than your stack.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.824
You in or out?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.784
You know that relative to their size,

02:39.910 --> 02:42.829
gorillas have smaller testicles
than humans.

02:43.539 --> 02:46.916
Well, then you'd probably have an edge
over a gorilla, but not over me.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.794
Reason is, primate testes' size

02:49.920 --> 02:53.005
inversely corresponds to the fidelity
of our females.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.301
You think there might be a better time
to annoy me about my wife?

02:57.427 --> 02:58.761
- I'm talking about poker.
- Right.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.972
Women are evil,
you're right to drive them away.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.307
Call, fold or raise.
Story time can wait.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.977
We're smaller and better than chimps,

03:06.687 --> 03:08.563
bigger and worse than gorillas.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.022
For all our rationality,

03:10.148 --> 03:13.401
our supposed trust and fealty
to a higher power,

03:13.527 --> 03:17.280
our ability to create a system of rules
and laws,

03:17.573 --> 03:20.741
our baser drives are more powerful
than any of that.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.870
We want to control our emotions,
but we can't.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.123
If we're happy, things don't annoy us.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.918
If, on the other hand,
we're sitting on crappy hole cards,

03:31.044 --> 03:34.046
little tiny things annoy us
a whole lot more.

03:38.886 --> 03:39.760
I raise.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.305
So, are you gonna tell me
an annoying story every time I raise?

03:42.431 --> 03:44.599
God, that would be annoying.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.475
I call.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.145
Dr. Cuddy, I got one of your patients
in the ER.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.938
Ian Alston, six-years-old.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.816
Oh, I know him. What's the problem?
I'm all in.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.735
Bloody diarrhea. Hemodynamically
stable,

03:55.861 --> 03:57.945
but he's been developing some
coordination problems.

03:58.071 --> 04:00.031
It sounds like gastroenteritis
and dehydration.

04:00.157 --> 04:02.283
Order fluids and I'll take it
on my service.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.534
Bet's to you, House.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.536
- They scan his head?
- No, why would they scan...

04:05.662 --> 04:07.455
Don't play games. You gonna call?

04:07.581 --> 04:09.624
- How's the heart rate?
- Stable.

04:09.750 --> 04:14.170
I'm sorry. House, it's gastroenteritis.
I'm not going anywhere.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.379
Put the order in,

04:15.505 --> 04:19.008
and have someone tell Alan and Sarah
that I'll be up when I'm done.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.260
You in or out?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.557
I'm out.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.355
Stone cold bluff.

04:32.481 --> 04:36.233
You might want to spend a little more
time paying attention to your cards

04:36.360 --> 04:39.111
and a little less time staring
at my breasts.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.863
They don't match either.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.949
I'm gonna take some air.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.929
Follow my finger with your eyes.

05:11.395 --> 05:13.396
How much longer will Dr. Cuddy be?

05:13.522 --> 05:16.440
Well, given the number of Mojitos
she's knocking back at the party,

05:16.566 --> 05:20.569
I'd say it's gonna be at least
three hours before she's even conscious.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.363
Weren't you at the same party?

05:22.489 --> 05:23.823
I don't drink.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.120
I want you to reach out
and grab my cane.

05:34.626 --> 05:35.710
What's wrong?

05:35.836 --> 05:39.046
Your son's brain is losing control
of his muscles.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.550
Dr. Cuddy's message said it was just
dehydration from diarrhea.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.176
She's wrong.

05:45.804 --> 05:47.680
Is he gonna be all right?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
I don't know.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.424
So, were you in one of those cages?

06:24.009 --> 06:28.220
No. No, no, no, no.
No, those are for tourists.

06:28.889 --> 06:30.848
You were in the water
with the great white?

06:30.974 --> 06:34.935
Sure, it's no big deal. You just have to
keep an eye on them.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.064
If they get too close,
punch them in the nose.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.191
Send them on their way.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.027
I had you going.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.195
You are mean.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.156
Hey. How's that anal fissure?

06:47.991 --> 06:50.117
Did it heal yet?
Or is it still draining?

06:50.243 --> 06:51.577
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:51.703 --> 06:53.370
I didn't realize you'd come back
for seconds.

06:53.497 --> 06:56.415
I figured that after that girl in the
stairwell you'd be done for the night.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.541
He's joking.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.460
No Adam's apple, small hands.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.462
It's no surprises this time.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.173
I'll see you later.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.010
Got a case.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.470
Well, you could've just said that.

07:09.596 --> 07:10.846
You didn't have to screw with me.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.972
If I didn't screw with you,

07:12.099 --> 07:14.225
you'd spent the whole night thinking
you might get laid,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.894
which means you'd be useless.
Better to extinguish all hope.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.147
Get Foreman and Cameron and meet me
upstairs. Stat.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.654
What's so urgent?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.907
Two cases, same symptoms.

07:30.242 --> 07:33.285
What do six-year-olds and 70-year-olds
have in common?

07:33.411 --> 07:34.995
Their immune systems don't work as
well.

07:35.122 --> 07:37.123
- Could be listeria.
- I already checked for that.

07:37.249 --> 07:39.959
Leukemia has a higher prevalence
in both young and old.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.461
- So does asthma.
- No, no, no.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.004
They can both get diabetes.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.297
No!

07:48.009 --> 07:49.927
The nearly dead and the newly bred

07:50.053 --> 07:53.222
have more in common with each other
than with people in the middle.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.600
It's weird.
It's kind of a circle of life thing.

07:56.726 --> 07:59.270
- This kid doesn't have kidney failure.
- He will.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.148
Based on this file,
the kid just ate some bad food.

08:02.274 --> 08:03.315
Was the old man...

08:03.441 --> 08:07.403
They were nowhere near each other
in any of the four dimensions.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.572
- This case is 12 years old.
- Yep.

08:09.698 --> 08:11.657
And this case is Cuddy's.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.033
She assigned it to me.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.871
She agrees with you that this is
something more than gastroenteritis?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.707
She wouldn't have assigned it to me
if she didn't, would she?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.258
What were we talking about?

08:29.384 --> 08:31.635
Two patients with two symptoms
in common.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.096
And five symptoms not in common.

08:34.222 --> 08:37.016
While you were all wearing your
"Frankie Says Relax" t-shirts,

08:37.142 --> 08:39.185
I was treating a 73-year-old woman

08:39.311 --> 08:41.395
who went through this progression
of symptoms.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.522
The last of which was...

08:46.818 --> 08:49.111
And in case any of you missed that class
in med school,

08:49.237 --> 08:50.946
that one's untreatable.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.489
Kid's got the first two.

08:52.616 --> 08:56.202
It took Ester an hour and 20 minutes to
go from two to three.

08:56.328 --> 08:58.495
And less than a day to make it
all the way to the rear exit.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.333
This is all because a child
has some blood in his diarrhea?

09:02.542 --> 09:03.459
He's got a tummy ache.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.669
If there was any reason to think it was
anything worse,

09:05.795 --> 09:07.046
Cuddy would be all over it.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.547
Great. Do a colonoscopy.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.717
On a six-year-old kid who probably has
nothing worse than some food poisoning?

09:11.843 --> 09:13.969
And if you happen to find any purple
papules,

09:14.095 --> 09:15.638
do me a favor and grab a slice.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.765
I wanna check for Erdheim-Chester.

09:17.891 --> 09:22.311
A disease that there have been, what,
maybe 200 reported cases of ever?

09:22.437 --> 09:26.815
If Ester's family had let me do
an autopsy, there'd be 201.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.247
See anything?

09:41.373 --> 09:43.415
No, and I don't expect to.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.585
House usually avoids cases.

09:46.711 --> 09:50.005
If he's actually stealing a case
from Cuddy, there's gotta be a reason.

09:50.131 --> 09:53.050
It's not the first time I've seen
this file.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.427
About a month before Cameron was
hired,

09:55.553 --> 09:57.554
some trucker came in here
with these symptoms.

09:57.681 --> 09:59.431
House decided he was dying.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.267
Two days and a spinal tap,

10:01.393 --> 10:03.602
bone marrow extraction,
and three colonoscopies later,

10:03.728 --> 10:05.938
we send the guy home
with a bunch of painkillers

10:06.064 --> 10:08.816
and a diagnosis
of a bad cheese sandwich.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.110
One of the guys who worked here
before me

10:11.236 --> 10:14.863
said House tried to cure Ester
at least three other times.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.410
You know how people see
the Virgin Mary in danishes and stuff?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.330
Someone died 12 years ago
and House doesn't know why.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.709
House sees that case now
in paint peeling,

10:27.794 --> 10:30.212
in clouds, and now in this poor kid.

10:30.505 --> 10:33.841
Erdheim-Chester is an abnormal growth of
some of the cells that fight infection.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.260
Is that cancer?
Cos he seems okay now.

10:36.386 --> 10:38.679
The other doctor kind of scared us
about that.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.557
He shouldn't have. We're just testing.
It'll probably be negative.

10:41.683 --> 10:42.558
I don't understand.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.686
You don't think that's what it is but
you want to do this thing to him anyway?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.147
- We need to be sure.
- Isn't there any other way?

10:48.273 --> 10:50.149
It shouldn't take long.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.026
All right.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.112
Those ridges look a lot like purple
papules.

10:55.238 --> 10:58.657
They're not purple. They're red.
Probably just blood blisters.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.661
Give me the biopsy needle.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.215
- How long is this gonna take?
- Forget it, Chase.

11:15.342 --> 11:19.428
Your punching out the shark story's
good, but she's not waiting for you.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.596
So?

11:20.722 --> 11:22.556
We couldn't confirm the source of
the bleeding,

11:22.682 --> 11:23.891
but we did biopsy some...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.643
- Blood blisters.
- You mean papules.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.645
Come on, Cameron. Who's right?

11:30.565 --> 11:33.192
Chase is. Negative for Erdheim-Chester.

11:33.318 --> 11:34.777
Let me see.

11:42.494 --> 11:44.119
If it's not Erdheim-Chester...

11:44.245 --> 11:47.873
It's exactly what we said before,
a garden-variety viral gastroenteritis.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.208
Can we go back to the party?

11:49.334 --> 11:51.251
Do a kidney biopsy.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.962
Ester's shut down in exactly...

11:54.089 --> 11:55.381
This kid is not Ester.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.216
You screwed up. She died. I'm sorry.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.468
But that does not mean this kid is dying
as well.

11:59.594 --> 12:03.764
Jeez, you're testy when you don't get
any fuzz. Come on.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.530
What'd the test say?

12:19.656 --> 12:21.031
Colonoscopy was clean.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.700
And the biopsy was negative for
Erdheim-Chester.

12:23.827 --> 12:27.204
So Ian's going to be all right?
It was just some sort of virus.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.789
What's that?

12:29.499 --> 12:30.624
Urine.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.459
Yeah, but it's brown.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.504
Ian's kidneys are shutting down.

12:35.630 --> 12:38.048
Still think it's not the same case?

12:54.190 --> 12:56.984
So, what can cause
bloody diarrhea,

12:57.110 --> 12:59.862
ataxia and kidney failure?

12:59.988 --> 13:02.114
- I'll go do a biopsy.
- Forget it!

13:02.240 --> 13:03.699
That battle's over.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.076
His rising creatinine is his kidneys'
way of saying,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.911
"Go on without me."

13:08.705 --> 13:10.914
What explains everything?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.919
E. coli HO-157 causes bloody diarrhea

13:16.045 --> 13:17.963
and leads to Hemolytic-uremic
Syndrome.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.757
Toxins from the bacteria
cause his kidneys to shut down.

13:20.884 --> 13:22.426
We should start him on plasmapheresis.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.804
Clear, concise
and completely plausible.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.099
And exactly what I did last time.
Didn't work.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.477
- What else?
- Goodpasture's Syndrome.

13:31.603 --> 13:33.896
Circulating antibodies cause kidney
failure and bleeding.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.856
But not the purple papules.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.691
If you throw in Ester's next symptom,

13:37.817 --> 13:39.610
brain, makes me think
heavy metal toxicity.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.154
His hematocrit would have to be low.
It's at 44,

13:42.280 --> 13:43.697
and Ester's never dropped below...

13:43.823 --> 13:45.741
- 42.
- You have the file memorized?

13:45.867 --> 13:47.534
It's my lucky number.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.744
What about lymphoma?

13:48.870 --> 13:53.499
Causes kidney failure, GI bleed, and can
infiltrate the base of the brain.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.001
You check Ester for that?

13:56.127 --> 13:58.545
She never showed any signs of...

13:59.964 --> 14:01.798
If he has lymphoma this far advanced,

14:01.925 --> 14:04.051
we should be able to see it in his blood
and brain.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.803
Chase, run a blood smear
and immunochemistries.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.889
Foreman, get an MRI.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.683
- I'll page Cuddy.
- No, you won't.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.227
She thinks the kid has a stomachache.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.395
Then she'll come right up here and do
one of two things.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.315
If she agrees with me, I don't need her.
If she disagrees, I don't want her.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.108
Can't handle people
disagreeing with you?

14:20.235 --> 14:21.735
She might have a different take on this.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.197
Subordinates can disagree with me
all they want. It's healthy.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.950
People who can shut me down
on the other hand...

14:28.076 --> 14:30.744
Forget Cuddy.
I'll have Wilson keep her busy.

14:38.586 --> 14:41.880
Keep your answers short and discreet.
Is Cuddy still playing?

14:42.966 --> 14:45.884
The chicken is still
in Piccadilly Square.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.887
Brilliant. She'll never suspect that
Normandy is our target.

14:49.013 --> 14:50.389
Is that House?

14:50.557 --> 14:53.809
Tell him that the blinds just went to
20-40 and he's running out of chips.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.186
- How's she doing?
- What's going on?

14:56.312 --> 14:58.105
The way you took off,
something's obviously...

14:58.231 --> 15:01.191
Love to chat but got a game to play.
How's she doing?

15:01.609 --> 15:03.902
The patient is on life support.
We're about to pull the plug.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.028
Are you talking about me?

15:05.154 --> 15:06.613
What've you got?

15:06.906 --> 15:09.700
Those sounds like high-dose cardio
meds.

15:09.826 --> 15:11.577
Two hearts.

15:11.703 --> 15:12.661
You got the flush?

15:12.787 --> 15:14.162
Still waiting on the final labs.

15:14.289 --> 15:16.081
Is she drinking her seltzer?

15:16.583 --> 15:19.126
No, hydration is not a problem.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.712
She's bluffing. Push her all in.

15:24.299 --> 15:25.465
Call.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.885
Two pair. Show me your hearts.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.309
Seven of clubs.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.186
Oh, dear. Sounds like I messed up.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.814
You're gonna be stuck with her
for a while.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.149
Talk to you soon.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.360
Oh, yes!

16:00.084 --> 16:02.044
Why are you taking a picture
of his head?

16:02.170 --> 16:04.046
We're looking for lymphoma, but...

16:04.172 --> 16:07.799
So, it's not Erdheim-something
and it's not his kidneys,

16:07.925 --> 16:09.551
but his kidneys are failing.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.844
Where's Dr. Cuddy?

16:10.970 --> 16:12.304
Dr. House mentioned another case.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.973
Is there another patient
with the same thing that Ian has?

16:15.099 --> 16:17.309
- Not exactly.
- What does that mean?

16:17.435 --> 16:19.561
Dr. House had a patient a while back

16:19.687 --> 16:21.855
who exhibited the same symptoms
as your son.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.067
- Then you know what's wrong?
- No.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.610
So what do you know?

16:26.736 --> 16:29.446
We know the likely course
the disease will take.

16:29.572 --> 16:30.572
Which is?

16:30.698 --> 16:32.574
She had multiple system failures
affecting...

16:32.700 --> 16:34.159
What happened to her?

16:38.081 --> 16:41.083
She died 24 hours after her admission.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.343
Mr. or Mrs. Alston,
would you mind giving me a hand?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.722
He's having trouble
sitting still.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.933
It's impossible to get the detail
we need.

16:58.059 --> 17:02.145
So I figured he might feel
more comfortable hearing your voices.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.318
Ian, honey.

17:09.987 --> 17:14.199
Just sit still. They'll be done
in a moment. We're here with you.

17:14.325 --> 17:15.784
I'm scared.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.037
It's okay, honey. It's...

17:19.163 --> 17:23.083
It's only a big camera. It's gonna take
a picture of your head.

17:24.168 --> 17:26.837
You love it when I take your picture
at home, don't you?

17:26.963 --> 17:28.088
Yeah.

17:29.090 --> 17:32.175
And you have to hold still for that,
too, right?

17:32.468 --> 17:34.469
But this isn't like that.

17:36.723 --> 17:40.183
I know it's scary, Ian,
but you can do it.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.979
You're getting to be so grown-up.

17:46.274 --> 17:51.194
So just hold perfectly still,
just for a little bit.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.197
Mommy, are you crying?

17:55.199 --> 17:58.994
No. No, honey, I'm just tired.

18:00.496 --> 18:02.664
Okay. I'll try.

18:31.903 --> 18:34.988
The base of his brain's been infiltrated
by a small mass. We think...

18:35.114 --> 18:36.907
- Pituitary?
- Looks that way.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.201
Explains the low blood pressure.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.663
And pretty much confirms the lymphoma.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.629
If we'd started Ester on prednisone...

18:50.755 --> 18:53.173
Did anyone see the lymphoma?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.967
No, we saw a mass.
The location is consistent with...

18:56.093 --> 18:58.011
Didn't see any in the blood either.

18:58.137 --> 19:01.223
White blood cells show no spindling
or abnormal nuclei.

19:01.349 --> 19:04.768
Nothing on immunochemistries either.
It's not lymphoma.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.552
House!

19:40.304 --> 19:41.638
It's a train.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.975
- We don't know what kind of train...
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.143
- I'm thirsty.
- It's closed.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.649
It's not now.

19:59.323 --> 20:02.325
We got one advantage.
We know where the tracks are going.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.162
The fact that the end of the line
is death is an advantage?

20:06.289 --> 20:08.623
The fact that we know is an advantage.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.084
It means maybe we can get ahead of it.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.128
Next station is the liver.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.755
We got about 90 minutes
before it gets there.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.175
Maybe we can cut down a tree
across the line just outside of town.

20:19.302 --> 20:20.302
I'll do an ultrasound.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.220
No, treatment will tell us more, faster.

20:22.346 --> 20:25.181
How can we start treatment if we have
no idea what we're treating for?

20:25.308 --> 20:27.183
Treat him for everything.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.186
Give him acetylcysteine, and interferon,
and silymarin,

20:30.313 --> 20:33.565
and whatever else you can think of
to protect the liver.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.288
What's going on?

20:48.414 --> 20:51.917
Oh, just catching up on some TV.
How're you doing?

20:52.043 --> 20:55.253
Well, thanks to your last consult,
the patient has improved dramatically.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.923
Tell House the patient is about
to kill the doctor.

20:58.049 --> 20:59.549
- She says the patient...
- I heard.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.469
- What've you got?
- Well, Cuddy just raised and...

21:02.595 --> 21:03.720
- You're paired.
- What?

21:03.846 --> 21:05.055
Nines.

21:07.433 --> 21:08.516
How do you know?

21:08.643 --> 21:11.186
Anything lower,
you wouldn't sound so excited.

21:11.312 --> 21:12.812
Jacks or higher,

21:12.939 --> 21:16.191
your voice sounds like Debbie from
accounting is sitting in your lap.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.443
Ask Cuddy if she can beat
a pair of threes.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.320
What's going on?
If you're gonna mess with me,

21:20.446 --> 21:21.988
wouldn't it be more fun to do it
in person?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.698
Yes, it would.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.577
Can you beat a pair of threes?

21:27.703 --> 21:28.745
What'd she do?

21:28.871 --> 21:30.997
I left orders for PO fluids, Doctor.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.375
Enough with the codes.
She obviously knows it's me.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.627
She's drinking her seltzer.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.462
Did she stop?

21:37.672 --> 21:39.172
- Yes.
- Go all in.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.967
- But...
- Just do it.

21:42.385 --> 21:44.302
You couldn't care less about
this charity event.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.388
You claim not to be messing with me.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.847
You're either trying to keep me...

21:47.974 --> 21:49.224
Shut up.

21:49.350 --> 21:52.811
Look, last time I wanted the game
to go on. I still do.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.146
It means that this time you get to win.

21:55.272 --> 21:56.314
Hold on.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.406
I fold.

22:12.957 --> 22:15.375
House, are you sure you're okay?

22:46.949 --> 22:50.160
Meds seem to be working.
Liver's holding its own.

22:50.828 --> 22:51.828
Good.

22:51.954 --> 22:54.372
- But the platelets are dropping.
- Even better.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.957
Why? It means he's getting sicker.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.418
It's new. New is good.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.504
Because old ended in death.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.217
I can't breathe.

23:07.595 --> 23:08.553
Chase!

23:11.057 --> 23:12.682
What's happening?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.688
Ian, come on.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.232
Honey, just relax.

23:21.692 --> 23:24.527
Ian, breathe. Come on, honey. Please.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.446
Please, honey.

24:19.625 --> 24:21.334
We had to put him
on a ventilator.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.503
He's back on Ester's path

24:24.213 --> 24:26.756
and we managed to make the train skip
a few stations.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.844
Which means that instead of 12 hours,
he's probably got less than two.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.680
Which begs the question, why?
What did we do?

24:33.806 --> 24:35.473
Acetylcysteine could mess
with the lungs.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.309
Mess with them, not shut them down
in 20 minutes.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.478
Interferon modulates the immune
system.

24:40.604 --> 24:43.523
It could affect a cancer of the blood,
like one of the leukemias.

24:43.649 --> 24:45.525
It doesn't speed them up.
It slows them down.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.277
It slows down all 500 of them?

24:47.403 --> 24:50.947
Anybody know where we can find
an oncologist at this hour?

24:55.494 --> 24:58.830
What effects would interferon have
on leukemia?

24:59.123 --> 25:01.791
Depends on what type. Could make
it better. Could make it worse.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.793
A four-year fellowship to learn that.

25:03.919 --> 25:05.545
Tell House if he wants
to play cards,

25:05.671 --> 25:07.547
he can get his ass back down here
and play.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.592
You hear that.
She wants me off the phone.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.260
Means she's vulnerable.
Go all in.

25:12.386 --> 25:16.139
But the party's over
in less than three hours.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.600
It's over in less than two hours,

25:18.726 --> 25:20.894
which means you either have

25:21.645 --> 25:24.022
three of a kind or just threes.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.691
I'm guessing threes.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.861
I bet $500.

25:31.614 --> 25:34.115
- Go all in.
- You obviously want to bust me.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.241
Why would you...

25:35.367 --> 25:36.409
Either you go all in,

25:36.535 --> 25:39.954
or I tell everybody in the building
that you wear toenail polish.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.582
I'm all in.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.835
I'll call.

25:46.462 --> 25:49.005
I'm betting you have a pair of threes,

25:49.131 --> 25:51.799
but even if you have three,

25:52.968 --> 25:55.720
it's not gonna beat trip nines.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.557
Oh! Oh! Oh, no!

26:00.309 --> 26:03.686
Oh, no! Oh! Oh, that's gotta hurt.

26:03.812 --> 26:04.771
What happened?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.522
I just killed two birds
with one straight.

26:06.649 --> 26:07.732
Goodbye.

26:08.609 --> 26:11.236
Fine, keep playing. But I need you
to recommend a good oncologist

26:11.362 --> 26:13.488
because if I don't get one up here
in the next few minutes,

26:13.614 --> 26:15.657
I got a dead six-year-old.

26:18.410 --> 26:21.663
If you need help, ask.
These games are insane.

26:22.248 --> 26:24.207
The games have a higher success rate.

26:24.333 --> 26:26.626
Well, I don't see anything that looks
like leukemia.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.045
- You do a bone marrow biopsy?
- No time.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.339
Even if there is an occult blood cancer,

26:31.465 --> 26:33.508
you wouldn't expect interferon
to make it worse.

26:33.634 --> 26:35.134
Certainly not this fast.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.845
- What would move this fast?
- Autoimmune diseases.

26:37.972 --> 26:39.722
If his body's own defenses
are attacking him,

26:39.848 --> 26:41.724
beefing them up is just gonna put
fuel on the fire.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.977
Sarcoidosis could be in his brain and
lungs.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.646
No. No enlarged hilar lymph nodes on his
chest x-ray.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.774
The systemic nature suggests Juvenile
Rheumatoid Arthritis.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.150
Or Kawasaki's Disease.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.610
Can't be Kawasaki's.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.654
That doesn't affect the elderly.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.573
This is a kid's x-ray?

26:57.700 --> 26:59.742
House had another patient.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.579
Who may or may not have had
Kawasaki's.

27:03.706 --> 27:04.872
This kid on the other hand,

27:04.999 --> 27:08.543
he makes antibodies that are eating
the inside of his arteries,

27:08.669 --> 27:11.629
choking off blood to his major organs,
one by one.

27:11.755 --> 27:15.633
First the GI tract, then the kidneys,
then the brain, now the lungs.

27:16.969 --> 27:21.264
Can anyone think of a reason why
Kawasaki's can't affect the elderly,

27:21.640 --> 27:26.436
other than that it doesn't? Nice.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.521
We can confirm with blood
work.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.481
We need an ANA, sed rate...

27:30.607 --> 27:32.233
Labs will take two hours.

27:32.860 --> 27:34.277
What was the old lady's sed rate?

27:34.403 --> 27:35.778
Elevated, 98.

27:35.904 --> 27:39.699
You can't use another patient's labs
to diagnosis Kawasaki's disease.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.075
Is that like a dare or something?

27:41.201 --> 27:42.660
You don't have time to be wrong.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.788
Fine. We'll look for Kawasaki where he
lives,

27:45.914 --> 27:47.874
Ian's coronary arteries.

27:53.964 --> 27:55.882
This other patient,

27:58.135 --> 28:00.803
the old lady, Ester?

28:04.475 --> 28:06.017
Have you read Moby Dick?

28:06.143 --> 28:07.435
It was a book?

28:07.686 --> 28:10.104
- It was ten years ago.
- Twelve.

28:10.439 --> 28:11.981
Obsession is dangerous.

28:12.107 --> 28:14.776
Only if you're on a wooden ship,
and your obsession is a whale.

28:14.902 --> 28:16.194
I think I'm in the clear.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.570
You do realize it's a metaphor.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.865
You realize the point of metaphors
is to scare people from doing things

28:20.991 --> 28:23.368
by telling them that something much
scarier is gonna happen

28:23.494 --> 28:25.787
than what will really happen.

28:25.996 --> 28:29.165
God, I wish I had a metaphor
to explain that better.

28:29.291 --> 28:33.127
Go back to the game. Don't worry,
I'm not gonna get eaten by witches.

28:37.925 --> 28:40.802
Coronary arteries clear.
No aneurysms.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.513
Flip the mode. Let's see the flow.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.185
How did that other woman die?

28:49.728 --> 28:52.772
She went into respiratory distress.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.942
- Her heart and liver were already...
- No.

28:57.152 --> 28:58.569
Did she suffer?

29:00.072 --> 29:01.656
Was she in pain?

29:01.782 --> 29:03.199
I don't know.

29:06.578 --> 29:10.373
Laminar flow. No blood clots,
no ragged edges.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.668
Damn. Shut it down.
We're just wasting time.

29:19.967 --> 29:21.384
Look at the right atrium.

29:21.510 --> 29:23.636
- That's not Kawasaki's.
- No.

29:24.555 --> 29:26.264
It's small, but it's there.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.808
Ester didn't have a mass in her heart.

29:28.934 --> 29:31.269
Ian's younger.
He can take more of a pounding.

29:31.395 --> 29:33.438
Ester died before the disease
reached her heart.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.565
The disease made a mass
and made it fast.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.275
- Could be bacteria.
- Muscle.

29:37.401 --> 29:38.317
Connective tissue.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.403
The kid can't take
any more theories.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.405
Only thing we know is that
whatever that mass is,

29:42.531 --> 29:43.948
that's what he's got.

29:44.074 --> 29:47.410
We need a piece of it.
I'm doing a biopsy.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.384
I'll shut the blinds.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.760
No, let them watch.

30:04.887 --> 30:07.513
I do my best work on the big stage.

30:09.057 --> 30:11.809
Passing through the superior vena cava.

30:11.935 --> 30:14.020
You're in the atrium. Pull back.

30:16.064 --> 30:18.483
You've hit the wall of the heart.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.276
These procedures would be
so much simpler

30:20.402 --> 30:22.945
if you could do them on healthy people.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.406
And out again.

30:28.410 --> 30:29.702
- V-fib.
- Cardiac arrest.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.412
Call a code.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.748
Come on, paddles!

30:35.876 --> 30:37.251
- Come on.
- Charge.

30:37.377 --> 30:38.586
Clear!

30:39.963 --> 30:41.756
Code blue, ISO room.

30:41.882 --> 30:44.008
Code blue, ISO room.

30:45.594 --> 30:47.011
And again.

30:50.557 --> 30:52.266
- Nothing.
- Again.

31:07.699 --> 31:08.950
You got a clock on this?

31:09.076 --> 31:11.577
How much longer
you gonna keep doing this?

31:11.703 --> 31:12.912
Clear.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.709
Wait. I've got something.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.297
He's back.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.599
- What are you doing?
- I'm doing what we came here to do.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.935
- It almost killed him.
- I know. I was right here.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.186
I need a Vacutainer.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.314
His brain's been oxygen deprived
for over eight minutes.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.983
There might be nothing left. He might...

31:42.109 --> 31:45.486
Tell the parents.
Where the hell is that Vacutainer?

31:57.583 --> 32:00.543
- So, what's he got?
- Brain damage.

32:00.669 --> 32:02.962
Good chance.
I was talking about before that.

32:03.088 --> 32:05.590
- You're not worried about...
- Things I can't do anything about?

32:05.716 --> 32:07.425
- I try not to.
- Yeah.

32:07.551 --> 32:09.802
Things just roll off you
like water off a duck.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.012
Histiocytosis.

32:11.138 --> 32:13.306
Very unlikely in a 73-year-old.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.933
Whatever this is, it's very unlikely.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.935
Come on. More ideas. Let's go, people.

32:18.061 --> 32:21.480
Genetic disorders could cause
masses everywhere. Tuberous sclerosis.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.566
If it's genetic,
he's had it all his life.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.026
- Why now?
- I don't know.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.611
It sure fits nice enough.

32:26.737 --> 32:28.529
We haven't ruled out leukemia yet.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.407
Or sarcoma. He could have multiple soft
tissue tumors.

32:31.533 --> 32:32.533
Or sarcoidosis.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.201
Multiple neurofibromatosis.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.953
Chondrocytomas.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.665
How's it going? You win?

32:39.791 --> 32:42.835
I got called away by the angry parents
of a patient.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.337
There are three of you here.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.922
None of you had the sense to stop him,
to pick up a phone and call me.

32:47.049 --> 32:48.424
I told them you'd signed off.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.760
The parents are mad
because their kid is dying.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.094
It's understandable.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.180
But if he doesn't die,
they won't be mad anymore.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.641
If he's brain damaged,
they might still be a little ticked.

32:56.767 --> 32:57.808
Had to do it to save him.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.519
You had to do it to diagnose Ester.

33:00.646 --> 33:02.521
You may have killed a six-year-old

33:02.648 --> 33:06.025
because you're obsessed with a woman
who's been dead for 12 years.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.361
Sometimes you lose, House!
You're not God!

33:08.487 --> 33:09.445
He's not dead yet.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.613
No, but you're done with him.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.990
It's my case now. Go home.
Go ride your motorcycle.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.661
Go brood in a dark room.
Just don't go near Ian again.

33:23.919 --> 33:27.046
So, anything else
or is it just these seven?

33:27.172 --> 33:28.506
Drop it, House. She's right.

33:28.632 --> 33:30.132
No, she's not!

33:31.259 --> 33:33.386
- You know she's not.
- We should have called her.

33:33.512 --> 33:34.845
I'm surprised you didn't.

33:34.971 --> 33:36.681
You're gonna have to find a way
to let this go.

33:36.807 --> 33:38.307
We can't go near Ian.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.267
We don't need to go near him.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.269
We have his tumor.

33:42.896 --> 33:45.272
Well, Cuddy may be right
that we screwed up the protocol.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.025
She may be right
about my screwed up obsession.

33:48.151 --> 33:50.653
But I'm right about the medicine.

33:50.821 --> 33:53.114
How many tests can we do with that?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.658
Look, we cure the kid,
we solve everybody's problems.

33:55.784 --> 33:57.118
How many?

34:00.080 --> 34:01.455
Maybe two good pieces.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.332
How many okay pieces?

34:04.126 --> 34:06.168
Three would be pushing it.

34:07.838 --> 34:10.131
Three tests, seven choices.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.342
Okay, what's first?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.970
Sarcoidosis seems most likely.

34:16.096 --> 34:19.557
Yeah. So likely that Cuddy's gonna think
of that all on her own.

34:19.683 --> 34:22.977
She's got the kid's whole body
to play with. Let her do that test.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.478
What's next?

34:24.604 --> 34:26.063
It's moving too fast to be spreading.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.399
It has to be growing from something
that's already there.

34:28.525 --> 34:30.401
Genetic disorder. Tuberous sclerosis.

34:30.527 --> 34:33.529
Or it's his immune system.
Histiocytosis.

34:34.239 --> 34:37.408
Well, there are more documented cases
of Histio amongst older people

34:37.534 --> 34:40.161
than tuberous sclerosis.
Let's start with that.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.752
Wing or drumstick?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.630
Gonna need a little more than that.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.007
A little more is more than a third.

34:53.133 --> 34:57.219
If we have to repeat this test
because you didn't cut us enough...

35:02.726 --> 35:05.686
I'm adding one micro liter
of the immunoperoxidase.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.938
Make it two. I don't want House
biting off our heads

35:08.064 --> 35:11.192
because we weren't sure
if it turned red or not.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.741
That's definitely not red.

35:24.331 --> 35:26.582
The problem could still be an abnormal
cell growth

35:26.708 --> 35:27.792
but a different cell line.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.085
Sarcoma?
Muscle cells are throughout his body.

35:30.212 --> 35:31.462
It would explain the geography.

35:31.588 --> 35:34.799
Genetic disorder is far more likely
in a six-year-old. Tuberous sclerosis.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.801
Pretty unlikely to cause a GI bleed.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.010
The time course fits.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.638
Mr. Foreman, you agree with
both of them? Thanks for playing.

35:40.764 --> 35:43.349
If we have enough tissue for two tests,
why not do both?

35:43.475 --> 35:44.850
Then we don't have to think as hard.

35:44.976 --> 35:47.937
Taking the pressure off the choice makes
us less likely to think critically.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.898
Sarcoma is more likely to hit a six
and 70-year-old.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.691
Tuberous sclerosis, it is.

35:52.818 --> 35:54.151
You think sarcoma is less likely?

35:54.277 --> 35:55.402
It's more likely.

35:55.529 --> 35:58.864
The test for it, on the other hand,
is less reliable.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.295
Test is negative. Well, that's
okay.

36:13.421 --> 36:17.967
If the tumor cells hadn't matured, the
Ki-67 protein wouldn't have turned off.

36:19.761 --> 36:22.221
- What happens if we don't solve this?
- Kid dies.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.598
I mean for the next 12 years.

36:25.976 --> 36:28.018
Ki-67's negative.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.816
And PCH antigen is negative.

36:45.245 --> 36:47.872
Mighty Casey's down to his last strike.

36:47.998 --> 36:49.957
Mighty Casey struck out.

36:50.166 --> 36:52.543
Thanks a lot. I was gonna read that this
weekend.

36:52.669 --> 36:56.046
Chondrocytoma. Connective tissue's been
in all the places we've been looking.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.716
The kid is too sick for that.
We're better off testing for sarcoma.

36:58.842 --> 37:01.594
We would've seen signs of that
when we tested for tuberous sclerosis.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.929
The tumor cells looked like muscle
under the microscope.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.891
No, they didn't. They looked like fat.

37:07.934 --> 37:10.019
I vote for neurofibromatosis.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.981
- Why?
- Because the other choices suck worse.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.116
Give me a minute.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.689
You want me out of here?

37:57.943 --> 37:59.985
You come up with anything?

38:02.113 --> 38:03.238
No.

38:30.100 --> 38:32.977
Hey. We can talk about it tomorrow.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.069
I...

38:43.905 --> 38:46.031
I won the poker tournament.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.911
I totally played this guy, Berman,
from business affairs.

38:51.037 --> 38:54.999
I got great cards. But I don't bet.
Just call, no raises.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.376
Berman pairs his king on the flop.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.920
I keep calling, the river turns,

39:00.964 --> 39:02.756
I check. He can't stand it.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.010
He goes all in. He's sure he's won.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.888
I call, I flip them.

39:11.474 --> 39:12.766
Pocket aces.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.685
I nailed his ass.

39:23.653 --> 39:26.030
The aces were hiding all along.

39:34.497 --> 39:36.957
Test him for Erdheim-Chester disease.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.460
Erdheim-Chester?
That's not even on the list.

39:39.586 --> 39:42.254
Because we already did it.
He tested negative.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.548
- So did Ester.
- The disease lied.

39:44.674 --> 39:47.676
Yeah, the tumor's got it in for you.
Diseases don't lie.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.970
Fine, it didn't lie. It slow played us.

39:50.096 --> 39:53.682
We biopsied the colon,
it hadn't reached the GI tract yet.

39:53.850 --> 39:56.643
It's there now.
It's in his liver, his lungs.

39:56.770 --> 39:58.687
You want it to be there.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.856
Because then you didn't screw up
12 years ago.

40:00.982 --> 40:04.818
We can't waste our one test
on the one disease we know it's not.

40:07.697 --> 40:09.323
Run the test.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.586
You sure about this?

40:22.712 --> 40:25.506
Wait. Let me think about that.
Don't pressure me.

40:25.632 --> 40:27.508
Just run the damn test.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.471
Cells look like macrophages.

40:32.597 --> 40:34.306
That's a good start.

40:40.313 --> 40:42.731
Take your time, and say it loud.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.201
CD 68 positive.

41:06.756 --> 41:08.465
Start the treatment.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.360
So, Ester can rest peaceful now, huh?

42:10.987 --> 42:12.154
Yeah.

42:18.870 --> 42:19.870
$40.

42:25.251 --> 42:26.877
You got lucky.

42:27.795 --> 42:29.296
You gonna call?

42:29.464 --> 42:30.881
What I do

42:31.966 --> 42:34.635
is not just based on the flip of a card.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.346
You guessed. You got lucky.

42:37.472 --> 42:38.472
It fit.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.683
It could just as easily have been
sarcoma or tuberous sclerosis.

42:41.809 --> 42:44.061
No, not just as easily.

42:44.187 --> 42:46.855
Maybe not. But it wasn't impossible.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.985
Are you gonna call?

42:53.655 --> 42:55.989
You know, relative to its size,

42:56.658 --> 42:59.743
the barnacle has the largest penis
of any animal.
