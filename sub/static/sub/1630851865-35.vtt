00:44.120 --> 00:44.960
[sighs]

00:45.239 --> 00:47.239
Three and four! Whoo! Whoo!

00:47.440 --> 00:49.280
-Hey, Moon!
-Hi, Ollie!

00:49.480 --> 00:51.760
Do you think you could be
a little quieter?

00:51.879 --> 00:53.400
I'm spending the day reading.

00:53.519 --> 00:56.239
Oh. But I was going
to spend the day dancing.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.599
-What should we do?
-Ah!

00:59.720 --> 01:03.120
Well, maybe you could read
with me for a while,

01:03.239 --> 01:05.679
and then I could watch you dance
for a while.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.360
Hmm. Could work.

01:07.480 --> 01:09.280
Depends.
What's your book about?

01:09.479 --> 01:11.080
Rio de Janeiro.

01:11.200 --> 01:12.039
[gasps]

01:12.160 --> 01:14.039
Rio? Oh! Isn't that the city

01:14.160 --> 01:16.039
where carnival
is happening today?

01:16.240 --> 01:18.600
Carnival? Hmm. Maybe.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.479
I think I skipped that part

01:20.600 --> 01:23.800
to get to the juicy stuff
about maps and flags.

01:23.920 --> 01:25.800
Carnival is a huge dance parade

01:26.000 --> 01:28.320
with music
and floats and costumes!

01:28.880 --> 01:31.600
Hmm. Let me see.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.200
Oh! A map of the parade route!

01:33.960 --> 01:36.399
Oh, wouldn't you love
to be there right now,

01:36.600 --> 01:38.520
dancing in that huge
parade crowd?

01:39.119 --> 01:41.039
Bump, bump, bump-bump-bump.

01:41.160 --> 01:42.440
Bump, bump, bump-bump-bump.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.240
Bump, bump, bump-bump-bump.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.600
Bump, bump...

01:45.920 --> 01:48.679
No, that's more of a you thing,
Moon.

01:49.039 --> 01:49.880
I like quiet.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.240
Bump-bump-bump?

01:52.360 --> 01:53.640
And not dancing.

01:55.039 --> 01:56.199
Bump-bump-bump.

01:56.399 --> 01:58.440
And not being in a parade crowd.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.759
-So we should go, then!
-What? No!

02:00.880 --> 02:02.800
You just ba-bumped
through the part

02:02.919 --> 02:04.600
where I told you I like quiet!

02:05.039 --> 02:07.520
Yes, but I'm having
a brainstorm!

02:07.880 --> 02:10.400
You can read your book
on a nice quiet beach

02:10.519 --> 02:12.480
and I can dance in the parade.

02:12.600 --> 02:16.600
And we can both do what we want
to do today, together!

02:17.560 --> 02:21.880
The beach would be nice
and quiet and warm.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.239
But I won't have to dance,
right?

02:24.480 --> 02:26.120
Because I could not do that.

02:26.239 --> 02:29.200
Not with so many eyes
staring at me! Ah...

02:29.320 --> 02:30.600
Don't worry, Ollie.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.359
You can have your peace
and quiet and I can have my...

02:35.920 --> 02:39.200
Bump, bump, bump-bump-bump.
Bump, bump, bump-bump-bump.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.359
Woohoo!

02:41.280 --> 02:43.200
Let's go! Come on!

02:50.079 --> 02:51.160
Whoo!

02:52.359 --> 02:53.760
Whee!

03:02.480 --> 03:05.000
<i>Welcome to Rio de Janeiro!</i>

03:12.440 --> 03:14.519
Wow! What a beach!

03:14.640 --> 03:17.320
Copacabana Beach
is really famous, Moon.

03:17.799 --> 03:19.320
And I can see why!

03:19.440 --> 03:21.679
-We'll have a great day here!
-Yeah!

03:22.560 --> 03:24.840
I see the perfect place
to practise my dance

03:24.959 --> 03:27.000
for the big parade today!

03:27.120 --> 03:28.799
I'll be over there!

03:29.200 --> 03:30.720
And I'll be right here.

[music starts]

03:53.799 --> 03:54.760
Hi! I'm Moon!

03:55.000 --> 03:55.959
I'm Fabiana!

03:56.600 --> 03:58.799
No, I'm Fabiana.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.440
[giggle]
We're both Fabiana!

04:01.560 --> 04:04.040
And I am Renato!

04:04.239 --> 04:06.359
[Together] We love your dance!

04:06.760 --> 04:07.959
[chuckles]

04:08.480 --> 04:11.959
May I share your dance video
with our friends?

04:12.079 --> 04:13.280
They will love it.

04:13.399 --> 04:14.280
Sure.

04:14.399 --> 04:17.360
I'm going to take a break now.
So, see you later!

04:21.680 --> 04:22.719
Guess what, Ollie!

04:22.840 --> 04:25.080
You'll never believe
what just happened!

04:25.200 --> 04:26.640
You met some parrots?

04:26.760 --> 04:27.760
How did you know?

04:28.760 --> 04:29.880
Oh, hee-hee!

04:30.000 --> 04:32.159
You guys,
this is my best friend, Ollie.

04:32.520 --> 04:34.719
Uh... Hello.

04:35.080 --> 04:36.120
They like my dance.

04:36.240 --> 04:38.360
We <i>love </i>your dance.

04:38.560 --> 04:39.919
And we were wondering...

04:40.039 --> 04:42.280
Can we have an autograph,
Miss Moon?

04:42.479 --> 04:43.719
-Me next!
-Me next!

04:44.000 --> 04:45.200
Whoa!

04:45.400 --> 04:47.360
Isn't it amazing, Ollie?

04:47.479 --> 04:49.039
I have fans.

04:49.479 --> 04:50.800
Hee-hee!

04:50.919 --> 04:52.200
Sure.

04:52.680 --> 04:55.360
Well, I should probably
get back to Ollie, now.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.960
Nice to meet you again.

04:57.080 --> 04:57.919
Uh-huh.

04:58.039 --> 04:59.640
It was lots of fun!

04:59.760 --> 05:00.680
Uh-huh.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.280
You're not leaving, are you?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.880
Nuh-huh.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.680
Hey, Moon, I just remembered
that we need to...

05:06.800 --> 05:08.919
Whoa! Look! Free parrot seed!

05:10.000 --> 05:12.200
Ollie! What are you doing?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.680
Your fans are really noisy,
Moon!

05:15.880 --> 05:17.479
And they won't stop staring!

05:17.599 --> 05:20.960
Plus, I came to Rio to have
<i>quiet </i>fun with you, remember?

05:21.080 --> 05:21.919
Hmm.

05:22.320 --> 05:24.680
This cable car
goes to Sugarloaf Mountain,

05:24.960 --> 05:26.120
where I can read

05:26.240 --> 05:28.359
and you can dance
without being disturbed by--

What's her favourite colour
and number?

05:51.599 --> 05:53.919
Is she more of a cake
or a cookies person? Hmm?

05:54.039 --> 05:55.680
She's... well...

05:57.599 --> 06:00.719
It's a long ride
to the top of the mountain.

-We've told all our friends

06:34.479 --> 06:35.880
about Moon's dance!

And they must have told
all their friends!

about Rio so far?

it's my fans.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.080
will we be seeing you dance
with Moon at carnival

07:43.200 --> 07:46.680
in front of millions,
possibly billions, of viewers?

07:49.479 --> 07:52.400
Say yes! Say yes! Say yes!

07:53.840 --> 07:55.280
Yes, of course he will!

07:55.400 --> 07:56.560
What?

07:56.919 --> 07:59.880
Moon! You know I can't dance
in front of millions,

08:00.000 --> 08:01.960
possibly billions, of viewers!

08:02.080 --> 08:03.320
[gasps] Oh, no!

08:03.440 --> 08:05.719
What did I say?
I got carried away.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.599
-Let me fix it!
-That's right.

08:07.719 --> 08:11.039
All fans are invited to carnival
tonight to see Miss Moon

08:11.159 --> 08:13.760
and Miss Moon's friend dance!

A word for your fans,
Miss Moon's friend?

08:17.479 --> 08:19.039
Ah!

08:21.799 --> 08:22.760
Ollie!

Oh, no! I've gotta find him!

We've got to find him!

Ollie!

08:37.400 --> 08:38.679
Ollie?

08:42.319 --> 08:45.199
Ollie's run away
and it's all my fault!

08:45.400 --> 08:47.600
If only I'd thought about
how <i>he </i>felt

08:47.720 --> 08:50.280
instead of getting caught up
in the excitement!

08:50.400 --> 08:53.920
Poor Ollie!
All alone and lost in Rio.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.000
I'm not lost. I'm hiding.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.240
[gasps] Ollie!

08:57.360 --> 08:58.199
You're OK!

08:58.480 --> 08:59.920
What are you doing in there?

09:00.040 --> 09:03.360
Getting some peace and quiet
where nobody can stare at me.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.120
They're selling these
up the street.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.640
What are you doing here?

09:07.760 --> 09:09.520
Aren't you supposed
to be dancing?

09:09.640 --> 09:11.040
Yes, it's time!

09:11.160 --> 09:12.079
Time!

09:12.199 --> 09:13.760
For carnival!

09:13.880 --> 09:16.800
No, guys. You go on
to the parade without me.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.400
I really let
my best friend down today.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.240
I don't feel like dancing
any more.

09:21.439 --> 09:22.520
What?

09:22.640 --> 09:24.760
No parade? No dancing?
No...

09:25.079 --> 09:25.959
ba-bump?

09:26.079 --> 09:27.880
No. I'm too sad.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.959
Are you sure?

09:30.160 --> 09:31.199
Ba-bump.

09:31.319 --> 09:32.640
I'm sure.

09:32.839 --> 09:34.560
Positive? Ba-bump.

09:35.640 --> 09:39.079
'Cause, you know, it's way
too dark to read under here.

09:39.199 --> 09:40.280
So, really...

09:40.480 --> 09:43.160
I might as well... dance!

09:45.920 --> 09:47.680
Ollie! You're dancing!

09:48.400 --> 09:50.319
Huh? Who's Ollie?

09:50.839 --> 09:52.480
This is just some cat
in a parrot head.

Nobody can see any Ollie...

You know, Ollie,

10:36.199 --> 10:37.800
Rio was fun and everything,

10:37.920 --> 10:40.800
but there is something
to be said for peace and...

10:45.880 --> 10:46.720
quiet?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.439
Ollie, I thought
you didn't like to dance!

10:50.560 --> 10:51.400
I don't!

10:51.959 --> 10:53.800
But this guy does!

10:53.920 --> 10:56.160
Well, let's go, "this guy"!

10:56.959 --> 10:58.000
Woohoo!
