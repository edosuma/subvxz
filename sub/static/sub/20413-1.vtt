00:06.273 --> 00:07.708
Oh, shut up, Dolly, get on with it.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.109
Don't talk to me like... okay.

00:10.678 --> 00:13.080
Just as I said, don't step on my foot.

00:13.113 --> 00:15.315
- Okay, darling. Okay.
- That's all I want...

00:15.348 --> 00:18.151
Have you seen my black toe?

00:18.185 --> 00:19.065
Well, how did you...

00:19.067 --> 00:21.090
I didn't stand on it on my own, darling.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.490
- One, two, three, four. Good.
- One, two, three, four.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.627
- You're such a good teacher, darling.
- I know I am.

00:41.074 --> 00:44.077
- And one, and two...
- Three. Now we go sideways.

00:44.111 --> 00:46.479
- Yes, okay.
- And don't forget. And side.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.530
What is going on?

01:03.964 --> 01:05.197
Dorottya.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.400
May I inquire what on earth is going on?

01:07.434 --> 01:09.069
Well, good morning, Ms. Trudeau.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.238
Freddy and Dolly were just
having an early morning dance,

01:11.271 --> 01:13.807
and they weren't dressed warm enough,
you know, so I thought that...

01:13.841 --> 01:16.109
- It is not your place, Dorottya.
- Mrs. Trudeau.

01:16.143 --> 01:18.478
You should have notified
the night nurse.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.048
I'll take over now...
Thank you.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
Merciful God, I'm so bored.

01:25.452 --> 01:27.320
Bored, bored.

01:27.354 --> 01:29.122
- Why?
- Must one have a reason?

01:29.156 --> 01:31.525
It depends what you're bored with.

01:31.559 --> 01:34.227
For one thing, you're the queen.
I'm glad you mentioned it.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.229
You've been on a crusade.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.331
You must have seen wonderful things,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.300
things that I've only dreamed of.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.670
And do you dream a lot,
Henry Plantagenet?

01:42.703 --> 01:45.906
Yes, I do. I hold the world in my hands.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.341
Daddy, please, be reasonable.
For once.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.410
That's a big dream.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.146
Yes. Tell me about Jerusalem.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.015
Jerusalem.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.384
Jerusalem was boring and very hot.

01:59.052 --> 02:00.854
Dimitri, Dimitri.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.757
What have I done that I should
be treated so disrespectfully?

02:03.791 --> 02:07.294
- Please stop being such an old ham.
- That it should come to this.

02:07.327 --> 02:08.562
Hmm?

02:08.596 --> 02:10.698
Hiring somebody to care about me.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.866
Caring for you.
It's not the same thing.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.002
We could never hope to pay
anyone to care about you.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.870
Oh!

02:16.904 --> 02:21.474
Thank you, Sophia. Always a kind word
for your dying father.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.176
Just see her for a few minutes.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.879
Talk to her, is that too much to ask?

02:25.913 --> 02:27.848
- Is she a Muslim?
- Oh, don't start that again.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.250
- Of course she's not a Muslim.
- The last one was a Muslim.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.219
- No, she wasn't. She was Russian.
- She had a burka.

02:32.252 --> 02:34.822
She didn't have a burka.
She had a cold.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.124
- I'm still not interested.
- Daddy, please.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.792
Oh! Bugger off!

02:39.693 --> 02:41.962
And let me rest in peace.

02:49.703 --> 02:52.339
You didn't say you were going
straight to the Oscars.

02:57.545 --> 03:00.814
I wish you all the luck in the world.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.451
- You must be Dorothy.
- Yes, Dorottya. Dorottya Horvat.

03:04.484 --> 03:08.288
- I'm Sir Michael Gifford's chauffeur.
- Nice to meet you, hello.

03:08.321 --> 03:09.590
Mmm...

03:40.721 --> 03:42.856
Sorry, what was your name?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.559
Joseph, miss... Joseph McGill.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.529
And how long have you been
working for Sir Gifford, Joseph?

03:49.196 --> 03:50.764
Over 40 years.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.833
My father saw his Lear in Belgrade.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.435
He used to rave about it all the time.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.470
- I was there, you know.
- No way.

03:57.505 --> 03:59.807
- I was his dresser back then.
- Amazing.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.276
He was the life and soul of the company.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.178
He'd be laughing and
joking in the wings,

04:05.212 --> 04:08.916
and then go on stage and play tragedy.

04:08.949 --> 04:10.283
If he had to cry in the part,

04:10.317 --> 04:13.286
I'd be waiting there in the wings
with a glass of champagne,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.222
to dab his eyes.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.959
Piper Heidsieck, 2002.
That's the year at the moment.

04:21.361 --> 04:26.066
Nowadays, I work mostly
for his daughter, Mrs. Morley.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.268
- Doing what?
- Driving.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.437
I do the gardening.
Lovely garden.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.406
- So you don't dress him anymore?
- Good God, no.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.077
He hates that now.
Hates being dependent.

04:37.110 --> 04:40.614
Quite right. I hate it, too.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.082
Well, I'm told he is difficult.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.151
No, no, miss, that's not right.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.454
He's bloody impossible.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.541
Wow.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.644
My God.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.846
- Rather big, isn't it?
- Oh, yes. Let me help you.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.947
No, no. No, no, no.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.449
I tell you, it's a nightmare to keep up.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.052
That's why I work in the garden.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.990
And, um, Mrs. Morley?
What's she like?

05:23.023 --> 05:27.728
She's her father's daughter.
Very strong willed.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.530
She wants him to sell up
and move in with her.

05:29.563 --> 05:33.133
But Sir Michael's lived
the whole of his life here.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.769
The best years, anyway.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.170
Oh, well.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.076
Hello, Miss Horvat.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.546
Dorottya, isn't it?

05:45.579 --> 05:49.182
Unusual name. Though not if
you're Romanian, of course.

05:49.216 --> 05:52.920
Hungarian, actually.
I am 100 percent Hungarian.

05:52.953 --> 05:55.556
- Even if my name is Horvat.
- Yes, yes, of course.

05:55.589 --> 05:58.826
Which in Hungarian means "Croat".
But I am Hungarian.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.594
My mistake entirely.

06:00.628 --> 06:03.330
This is Dr. Alastair Satterthwaite,
my father's doctor.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.632
A pleasure to meet you.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.334
And this is Milly Holcombe,
she manages the house.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.902
Miss Horvat, I'm very sorry,

06:08.936 --> 06:11.672
but it seems like you've come
all this way for no reason.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.808
My father refuses
to have you as his carer.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.610
I am very sorry.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.679
I don't know what you mean.
Sir Gifford hasn't even met me.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.047
You mean, "Sir Michael."

06:20.080 --> 06:22.716
We don't say "Sir Gifford"
in this country.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.187
I'm sorry.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.690
Perhaps if we let Miss Horvat
stay for a few days...

06:29.723 --> 06:31.759
I don't think that's a good idea.

06:31.792 --> 06:32.465
It's a jolly good idea.

06:32.467 --> 06:33.928
He might change his mind.
Just to spite you.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.965
Joseph and I are perfectly capable of
looking after Michael. We really are.

06:37.998 --> 06:40.300
Joseph hates doing it.
He said so himself.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.002
And Sir Michael hates it, too.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.173
You already know, I gather,

06:46.206 --> 06:48.942
that Sir Michael suffers from
a rare type of Parkinson's disease.

06:48.976 --> 06:51.244
- Yes.
- He has his good days, and,

06:51.278 --> 06:53.547
well, less good ones.

06:53.581 --> 06:57.184
For the time being, we can alleviate
the symptoms with medication,

06:57.217 --> 07:01.722
but he soon might need to be
bathed, taken to the lavatory.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.159
Wiped, if needs be.

07:06.193 --> 07:09.396
Are you quite sure you're the kind
of person that could do that?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.764
Definitely, yes.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.768
Unfortunately, I...
I have experience.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.570
Before my father died, near the end,

07:16.604 --> 07:18.171
I saw how much he was suffering

07:18.205 --> 07:21.008
because he couldn't produce...
Stool?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.210
Yes, the word is stool.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.379
So sometimes I took him
into the lavatory,

07:26.413 --> 07:29.016
and I put my finger into his, uh...

07:29.049 --> 07:29.867
Rectum...

07:29.869 --> 07:32.320
Rectum, yes, thank you.
To relieve him.

07:32.352 --> 07:36.123
I didn't like doing it, but he was
my father, and he was in pain.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.958
And that's what it's all about, right?

07:38.859 --> 07:41.028
Helping and relieving.

07:43.196 --> 07:46.399
Okay, well, I suppose
you can stay for a day or two.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.468
Milly, will you take care
of Miss Horvat?

07:48.502 --> 07:50.971
Make sure she's fed and...
Well, you know.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.440
Is that okay with everyone?
Good.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.045
So, what made them
change their minds, miss?

07:58.846 --> 08:01.014
- I did.
- Oh!

08:02.482 --> 08:05.085
Excuse me, where is this one from?

08:05.118 --> 08:08.155
Oh, Lord. BBC.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.657
Some king or other.

08:10.423 --> 08:13.661
Lots of kings. 1978.

08:13.694 --> 08:17.330
- And that one up there?
- Troilus and Cressida.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.232
Very good.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.482
Shit.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.186
A- ha!

08:39.219 --> 08:40.486
Got you, you little bastard.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.477
Yes. Okay, you're
going back in the pond.

09:06.346 --> 09:07.380
Yes.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.117
Shit.

09:19.893 --> 09:21.261
Argh!

09:21.294 --> 09:22.896
Help!

09:22.930 --> 09:24.331
Someone, come on!

09:25.465 --> 09:26.734
Help me!

09:26.767 --> 09:29.302
Hey! Someone fucking help me!

09:29.336 --> 09:30.437
Help me!

09:41.281 --> 09:43.551
When you've quite finished gawking,

09:43.584 --> 09:48.088
would you please be so kind as to get
me out of this suppurating rose bush?

09:48.121 --> 09:50.558
I feel like Buster fucking Keaton
on a bad day.

09:57.464 --> 10:00.100
- Who the fuck are you?
- I am Dorottya.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.602
I didn't ask your sodding name,

10:01.635 --> 10:02.803
I asked who the fuck you are.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.838
What are you doing in my garden?

10:04.872 --> 10:06.540
I'm your new career.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.877
- You're my "new career"?
- Yes.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.745
Now, there's a depressing thought.

10:13.581 --> 10:15.348
Fucking frogs!

10:15.382 --> 10:18.285
I've spent a fortune on this
adventure park for them,

10:18.318 --> 10:20.320
and the little buggers
won't even go near the place.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.922
Why do you think that is?

10:21.955 --> 10:24.658
They just can't appreciate beauty.

10:26.359 --> 10:27.861
What did you say your name was, again?

10:27.895 --> 10:29.997
Dordogne? Torino? Burrito?

10:30.030 --> 10:32.199
Dorottya.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.268
You're a scrawny little thing.
I pulled you up, didn't I?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.904
Not very pretty.
Actually... Well, I think...

10:38.238 --> 10:40.974
You look like a girl
I used to fancy in nursery.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.409
Which you look as
if you're still attending.

10:42.442 --> 10:44.978
And don't say I look like someone.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.747
I'm too famous to look like anyone else.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.415
Other people look like me.

10:48.448 --> 10:49.783
If they're lucky.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.952
Oh! Oh.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.788
I think I need to lie down.
I'm going to be sick.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.690
Oh! No.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.426
Michael.

10:59.459 --> 11:03.430
Michael, you are all right?
What's happening?

11:03.463 --> 11:06.233
Don't fuss, Milly. I'm all right.
Tickety boo, never better.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.335
You are covered in rose petals.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.303
- Oh, yes, yes, rose petals.
- Didn't you know?

11:10.337 --> 11:11.772
This young lady and I just got married.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.741
- Really?
- I'm sorry you haven't been introduced.

11:13.774 --> 11:17.845
This is Lady Dordogne
Dorito Burrito Gifford.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.213
And we're on our way
to consummate the union.

11:20.247 --> 11:23.450
For God's sake.
Oh, Milly, please, don't upset yourself.

11:23.483 --> 11:26.887
Just go back where you came
from and leave me alone.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.488
Michael, this is the girl
you told Sophia...

11:28.522 --> 11:31.659
"Take thy form from off my door!

11:31.692 --> 11:35.128
"You fucking Raven, nevermore."

11:44.505 --> 11:47.240
Silly cow.

11:47.274 --> 11:51.779
Problem is, she adores me,
so I can't be too hard on her.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.982
You did well, Tortilla.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.651
Dorottya.
Whatever.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.689
- Tell me who you are again.
- I am your career.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.356
- Carer.
- "Carer."

12:03.390 --> 12:06.026
- The word is pronounced "carer."
- Carer.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.900
You haven't got a...

12:12.933 --> 12:15.836
Oh, no, I don't smoke. And I don't
think that you should, either.

12:15.869 --> 12:18.071
Who the fuck cares what you think?

12:19.540 --> 12:21.509
I'm a dying man,

12:21.542 --> 12:24.111
and it's traditional to give
a dying man a cigarette.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.180
You'll find some over there.

12:27.214 --> 12:32.252
In the Complete Works,
Shakespeare, page 1613.

12:37.324 --> 12:39.192
Ah! Mmm.

12:51.639 --> 12:55.909
Now, you, too,
quickly pave the way to hell.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.037
- Hello, miss.
- I'm so sorry. Hi.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.907
How are you getting
along with Sir Michael?

13:26.940 --> 13:30.611
I'm not. Milly will hardly
let me near him.

13:30.644 --> 13:32.312
I'll have a word.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.548
Excuse me.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.249
Hello.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.555
A letter came for you.

13:41.589 --> 13:42.856
Turn on your video.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.028
It's from the drama school.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.496
What does it say?

13:52.265 --> 13:54.835
"Dear Miss Dorottya Horvat."

13:54.868 --> 13:58.138
"We are pleased to inform you,
that your application..."

13:58.171 --> 14:00.974
You are in.
You've passed the first test.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.576
- No way.
- Successful.

14:02.610 --> 14:05.478
You have to ring some Ms. Henderson

14:05.513 --> 14:08.348
to confirm your appointment
for the second round.

14:08.381 --> 14:10.383
Don't forget to give them
your new address.

14:10.417 --> 14:12.920
"Care of Sir Michael Gifford,"
they'll love that.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.987
Dorottya!

14:14.655 --> 14:16.323
Dorottya!

14:16.356 --> 14:17.925
- She's over here.
- Where is "here"?

14:17.958 --> 14:19.527
I have to go now. Bye.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.795
Bye, Joseph.
Helping me in the garden.

14:21.829 --> 14:25.633
We don't pay her to help you in
the garden. Tell her to come at once.

14:25.666 --> 14:27.334
- Go away!
- Michael, it's only Milly.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.402
- Leave me alone!
- Michael, please.

14:30.771 --> 14:32.472
- What's wrong?
- I said, fuck off!

14:32.506 --> 14:34.241
I think he had an accident.

14:34.274 --> 14:36.276
- I'm coming in.
- Go away!

14:40.380 --> 14:43.584
- Oh, no.
- Yes, it stinks.

14:43.617 --> 14:47.254
Stinkus, stinka, stinkum.

14:47.287 --> 14:50.558
Did you...
Well, obviously I did.

14:50.591 --> 14:54.628
- A number two?
- Of course it's a fucking number two!

14:54.662 --> 14:56.997
Is this how pee smells in Bulgaria?

14:57.030 --> 14:59.567
Hungary.
Fuck Hungary!

14:59.600 --> 15:01.401
Oh! Just leave me alone!

15:01.434 --> 15:03.270
Of course I'm not
just gonna leave you alone.

15:10.010 --> 15:13.146
"What's in a name?"

15:13.180 --> 15:19.753
"That which we call a rose by any
other name would smell as sweet."

15:23.290 --> 15:27.761
"Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you,

15:27.795 --> 15:30.030
trippingly on the tongue,

15:30.063 --> 15:34.301
but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do,

15:34.334 --> 15:38.405
I had as lief the town-crier
spoke my lines."

15:38.438 --> 15:43.343
"Be not too tame neither, but let
your own discretion be your tutor."

15:43.376 --> 15:45.913
How the fuck do you do that?

15:45.946 --> 15:48.516
When you can't even
speak proper English.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.252
- I've been on the stage.
- Oh.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.757
Now, just relax.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.394
Oh, God.

16:01.428 --> 16:02.604
No, I'm afraid, I think...

16:02.606 --> 16:04.866
Probably, this is the
best thing to do then.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.967
Okay.
No, I'll tell her. I'll tell her.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.103
All right. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

16:13.006 --> 16:14.708
So...

16:14.742 --> 16:17.511
The job is yours if you want it.

16:17.545 --> 16:19.279
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.849
No, don't thank me.
It was Sophia's decision.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.458
I hope you'll last.

16:31.491 --> 16:32.960
I'll be okay.

16:38.265 --> 16:42.035
So, after what's happened we'll have
to bring Michael's bed downstairs

16:42.069 --> 16:44.204
and put it in the dining room.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.575
And convert the scullery
into a bathroom.

16:47.608 --> 16:49.643
Sir Michael's going to sleep
in the dining room?

16:51.845 --> 16:53.013
Yep.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.752
And you'll be next door.
It won't be as nice as it was upstairs,

16:58.786 --> 17:02.122
but you'll have to stay
close to him day and night.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.503
I'll arrange your pillows.
You should sleep.

17:16.537 --> 17:19.439
Oh! So now you're gonna
tell me when to sleep?

17:19.472 --> 17:23.511
I'm sorry I got that wrong.
I should sleep.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.279
You were hired to give
a 24 hour service.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.617
Exactly.
And the 25th hour is just starting.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.290
Sweet dreams.

17:51.972 --> 17:53.874
"To be or not to be."

17:55.108 --> 17:56.109
No, no.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.513
To be or not to be.

18:00.581 --> 18:01.782
That is...

18:02.683 --> 18:03.984
Dorottya!

18:04.017 --> 18:05.385
That is the question.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.754
Dorottya!

18:10.457 --> 18:13.193
Do you know this?
This is why you called?

18:13.226 --> 18:16.764
- Do you know it or not?
- Of course I do.

18:16.797 --> 18:17.972
To Be or Not to Be.

18:17.974 --> 18:21.002
Do you know, it was
all made by Hungarians.

18:21.034 --> 18:24.705
Hungarian producer, Hungarian cameraman,
Hungarian set designer.

18:24.738 --> 18:26.707
Even the man who wrote
the script was a Hungarian.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.809
Hungarian my arse.
He was Polish.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.778
Why do you always have to argue?

18:30.811 --> 18:32.224
His name is Melchior Lengyel.

18:32.226 --> 18:34.516
Which means Polish,
but he was Hungarian.

18:34.548 --> 18:39.419
Of course. Who wasn't?
Anyway, anyway. Take a look at this.

18:39.452 --> 18:42.790
Here is how it should be played.
He walks forward.

18:42.823 --> 18:45.926
And he says, "To be..."
To be...

18:45.959 --> 18:49.096
And here, he should take the long pause.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.298
Everybody knows what's coming,

18:51.331 --> 18:53.200
but he keeps them waiting for it.

18:53.233 --> 18:56.637
And then the fucking idiot
prompter comes out with...

18:56.670 --> 18:58.071
"Or not to be."

19:00.273 --> 19:03.777
- Much funnier, don't you think?
- Mel Brooks did.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.146
- What?
- That's exactly how his version goes.

19:08.348 --> 19:12.285
Oh, well, then.
He is clearly as talented as I am.

19:34.942 --> 19:38.946
Where in the name of Poseidon's
barnacled backside have you been?

19:38.979 --> 19:41.281
I'm sorry.
I took the wrong bus.

19:41.314 --> 19:44.552
I mean, I took the right bus
in the wrong direction.

19:44.585 --> 19:47.220
The stupid bus stop is on
the wrong side of the road.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.956
Got my cigarettes?

19:50.658 --> 19:51.725
Ah!

19:53.761 --> 19:55.428
- What the hell is this?
- Guess.

19:59.867 --> 20:01.334
I also bought these.

20:17.117 --> 20:20.020
You see, you can cry without champagne.

20:21.589 --> 20:24.257
Something you've learned about yourself.

20:28.061 --> 20:30.163
You've been talking to Joseph.

20:30.197 --> 20:33.466
How it had to be Piper Heidsieck 2002.

20:33.501 --> 20:35.503
Joseph talks rot.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.139
2006 was perfectly adequate.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.387
I'm not interested.

20:54.421 --> 20:57.057
- Try it.
- Don't want to.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.159
It's so simple.

20:59.192 --> 21:03.531
Look, all you have to do is press
this key here, and you can text.

21:03.564 --> 21:06.299
And you don't even have to write
whole words. Understand?

21:08.168 --> 21:10.704
- No.
- Oh yes, you do. Don't be such a baby.

21:10.738 --> 21:13.273
- All you have to...
- Oh! Please don't start again.

21:13.306 --> 21:14.975
Well, then do it.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.277
Shan't.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.616
I already put my number
into your memory, so...

21:22.650 --> 21:24.518
What?

21:24.552 --> 21:26.286
You can write something,
and text it to me immediately.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.387
Come on, try.

21:32.693 --> 21:33.761
Oh!

21:37.430 --> 21:39.767
The cat dug his claws into my balls.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.238
- What was all that screaming?
- The cat.

21:45.272 --> 21:46.406
But it didn't hurt him.
He's fine.

21:50.511 --> 21:52.112
I just...

21:52.145 --> 21:55.816
I just can't bear to think
about him in those nappies.

21:55.849 --> 21:58.218
He'll be okay.
I promise.

22:02.122 --> 22:03.456
When someone's as young as you,

22:03.490 --> 22:05.893
there's nothing very complicated
about old age.

22:05.926 --> 22:08.629
A person's just old, and that's that.

22:12.232 --> 22:16.169
When you look at Michael,
you see a sad, old, incontinent man.

22:16.203 --> 22:19.006
But when I...

22:19.039 --> 22:22.710
When I look at him, I just see
all the Michaels I've ever known.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.346
That's not true.

22:26.379 --> 22:29.517
When I look at him, I see all
the glorious roles that he has played.

22:31.885 --> 22:34.254
Well, you've certainly lasted a lot
longer than any of the others.

22:34.287 --> 22:35.589
He must like you.

22:35.623 --> 22:37.958
I make him laugh.
He says you're not stupid.

22:37.991 --> 22:42.730
Which is the nicest thing he's said
about anyone in the last 25 years.

22:42.763 --> 22:44.598
I had Sophia on the phone.
I told her that.

22:45.533 --> 22:47.300
Thank you.

23:41.755 --> 23:44.992
You think the frogs smell
the presence of death?

23:45.025 --> 23:46.927
Please stop talking about death.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.530
- Why not?
- It's all I've got left.

23:49.563 --> 23:53.466
That and shitting in my nappies.

23:53.501 --> 23:57.104
I don't suppose there's any point in
asking you to help me to commit suicide?

23:57.137 --> 23:59.472
Um, no.
You won't get into any trouble.

23:59.507 --> 24:02.375
Oh, I've got it all worked out.
No.

24:02.409 --> 24:04.077
Scared you'd lose your job?

24:04.111 --> 24:08.015
Obviously. They wouldn't pay me
to push around an empty wheelchair.

24:08.048 --> 24:09.449
I thought so.

24:17.257 --> 24:18.759
It is hard to have a conversation

24:18.792 --> 24:22.162
with someone who knows what
I've got on under my trousers.

24:22.195 --> 24:24.598
Think of it as a protection
from the cat's claws.

24:26.433 --> 24:29.069
It's like doublet and hose.

24:29.102 --> 24:30.671
You remember that actor from the movie?

24:30.704 --> 24:32.706
He always looked like he was
wearing nappies, right?

24:32.740 --> 24:34.107
- Jack Benny.
- Yeah.

24:36.977 --> 24:38.712
So, tell me.

24:40.413 --> 24:42.415
Why are you really here?

24:44.184 --> 24:45.853
I don't know what you mean.
I'm your carer.

24:45.886 --> 24:48.088
Carer, my arse.

24:48.121 --> 24:50.190
Career, more like it.

24:51.759 --> 24:53.794
You say you're an actress.

24:54.828 --> 24:56.129
Hmm...

24:56.163 --> 24:58.365
"A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet."

24:58.398 --> 25:00.534
Well, obviously you must
have played Juliet.

25:00.568 --> 25:02.836
No, I haven't.
But I did play Hamlet.

25:02.870 --> 25:05.105
What are you?
Another Sarah fucking Bernhardt?

25:05.138 --> 25:06.707
Well, I was much better than her.

25:06.740 --> 25:08.408
Ooh! Oh!

25:08.441 --> 25:11.278
Modest with it.

25:11.311 --> 25:15.649
I grew up in an experimental theater.
Ah! Suck it and see.

25:15.683 --> 25:20.854
There was a director, the heart
and soul of the company.

25:20.888 --> 25:23.724
He said, "Being an actor
is not something you do,

25:23.757 --> 25:26.393
"it's something you are."

25:26.426 --> 25:29.396
So I said to him, "Let me be Hamlet."

25:29.429 --> 25:33.033
He was very ill by then and
far beyond worrying about critics.

25:33.066 --> 25:35.002
So he let me be Hamlet.

25:35.035 --> 25:36.670
They gave it rave reviews in the end,

25:36.704 --> 25:38.371
but he didn't live to read them.

25:39.907 --> 25:41.742
A merciful release, perhaps.

25:45.412 --> 25:47.581
So, is that why you're here?

25:50.050 --> 25:51.284
I don't know what you mean.

25:55.022 --> 25:58.726
"Will you play upon this pipe?"
Recognize it?

25:58.759 --> 26:01.461
Act Three, Scene Two.
But I don't know it in English.

26:01.494 --> 26:03.797
Oh! Come on, Dorottya.

26:03.831 --> 26:06.133
You're not gonna pass up
the chance to play Guildenstern

26:06.166 --> 26:09.670
opposite to
Sir Michael Gifford's Hamlet?

26:09.703 --> 26:11.071
"Will you play upon this pipe?"

26:12.773 --> 26:15.776
"My Lord, I cannot."
"I pray you."

26:15.809 --> 26:19.412
"Believe me, I cannot."
"I do beseech you."

26:19.446 --> 26:21.148
"I know no touch of it, my Lord."

26:21.181 --> 26:23.517
"'Tis as easy as lying.

26:23.551 --> 26:26.486
"Govern the ventages
with your finger and thumb,

26:26.520 --> 26:28.355
"give it breath with your mouth,

26:28.388 --> 26:31.792
"and it will discourse
most eloquent music."

26:31.825 --> 26:35.929
"But these cannot I command
to any utterance of harmony,

26:35.963 --> 26:37.898
"I do not have the skill."

26:39.633 --> 26:40.801
No.

26:41.569 --> 26:43.403
You have not the skill.

26:45.238 --> 26:48.241
You have absolutely no chance
of making it on the stage here.

26:53.747 --> 26:56.449
- I can learn.
- You certainly need to.

26:56.483 --> 26:58.385
- Then teach me.
- Out of the question.

26:58.418 --> 27:01.121
- Why?
- You have to look up to your teacher.

27:01.154 --> 27:02.723
But I do look up to you.

27:02.756 --> 27:05.626
Of course. From below.
When you're washing my arse.

27:21.274 --> 27:23.476
- Hello, Joseph.
- Hey.

27:23.511 --> 27:25.513
- Will you take her around?
- You bet.

27:27.748 --> 27:29.517
Where's Milly?

27:29.550 --> 27:32.252
She's taking Dorottya
to the train station.

27:32.285 --> 27:34.688
She's been telling me
how well you get on with her.

27:34.722 --> 27:36.957
- I'm so pleased.
- With whom?

27:38.091 --> 27:40.060
Miss Horvat.

27:40.093 --> 27:43.163
Alastair also says she's
doing a first-class job.

27:43.196 --> 27:46.266
I haven't the foggiest idea
who you're talking about.

27:46.299 --> 27:49.369
Of course you do.
Joseph picked her out for you.

27:49.402 --> 27:53.406
Which immediately made her far more
suitable than the ones I found.

27:53.440 --> 27:57.978
Mmm... "Did I deserve
no more than a fool's head?

27:58.011 --> 27:59.379
"Is that my prize?"

28:03.817 --> 28:07.588
Funny you should mention prizes.
I got a call this morning.

28:07.621 --> 28:10.323
The Critics' Guild want to give you
a Lifetime Achievement Award.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.792
About fucking time.

28:12.993 --> 28:14.928
What? They run out of pygmies?

28:14.962 --> 28:16.664
TV stars and second-raters?

28:19.032 --> 28:22.335
- Do I have to pay?
- Of course you don't.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.371
I said that you'd be very honored,

28:24.404 --> 28:26.373
and I would accept the award
on your behalf.

28:26.406 --> 28:27.541
Mmm...

28:27.575 --> 28:29.009
Just like your mother.

28:30.611 --> 28:33.446
Not only my money,
you want my glory, too.

28:35.883 --> 28:38.051
God. What a monster you've become.

28:39.853 --> 28:41.454
Or were you just born that way?

28:41.488 --> 28:43.857
I don't know.
You'd have to ask my mum.

28:48.562 --> 28:52.232
And find Joseph, will you?
I need a word.

29:08.649 --> 29:10.317
Do you think
they're all the same age?

29:10.350 --> 29:12.185
I haven't the foggiest idea.

29:12.219 --> 29:15.989
Or do you think there are old birds,
and young birds, and middle-aged birds,

29:16.023 --> 29:20.528
and one day the oldest ones
just drop out of the sky, dead?

29:22.462 --> 29:24.397
"There's a certain providence
in the fall of a sparrow."

29:24.431 --> 29:26.133
"In the fall of a sparrow."

29:26.166 --> 29:29.670
"If it be now, 'tis not to come.
"'Tis not to come."

29:29.703 --> 29:32.940
"If it be not to come, it will be now."
"It will be now."

29:32.973 --> 29:36.343
"If it be not now, yet it will come..."
"If it be not now..."

29:37.645 --> 29:39.680
"The readiness is all."
"The readiness is all."

29:39.713 --> 29:42.516
Don't tell me you've played Hamlet, too?

29:42.550 --> 29:44.417
Don't be absurd.

29:44.451 --> 29:45.972
I've seen Michael play
it so many hundreds

29:45.974 --> 29:47.355
of times that some of it's gone in.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.089
A bit like passive smoking.

29:50.624 --> 29:52.626
You're a funny girl, Dorottya.

29:54.227 --> 29:57.631
That's probably why he's
taken to you like he has.

30:02.069 --> 30:05.138
I don't think I was
ever really very funny.

30:06.840 --> 30:09.342
Can I ask you a personal question?

30:10.844 --> 30:12.212
Were you and him ever...

30:14.447 --> 30:17.150
It was ages ago.

30:17.184 --> 30:19.653
He didn't want to get a divorce,

30:19.687 --> 30:22.222
I wanted to kill myself.

30:22.255 --> 30:25.158
I didn't, of course.
People generally don't.

30:25.192 --> 30:26.259
Some do.

30:27.861 --> 30:30.798
Particularly the very young.

30:30.831 --> 30:31.603
They're so impatient.

30:31.605 --> 30:33.367
They're incapable of
waiting for anything.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.902
Even death.

30:38.238 --> 30:40.641
Drink up. You've got a train to catch.

30:43.877 --> 30:46.647
- You wanted to see me, sir?
- Yes, Joseph.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.181
Come in.
Close the door.

30:50.217 --> 30:53.353
- You're looking a bit scruffy.
- I've been gardening, sir.

30:53.386 --> 30:58.859
Oh! Yes, of course.
"Thrift, thrift, Horatio!"

30:58.892 --> 31:01.294
- Sit down.
- I...

31:02.563 --> 31:04.464
Sit! Mmm!

31:04.497 --> 31:08.268
- Tea? Do you like muffins?
- No, thank you, sir.

31:09.970 --> 31:11.404
How long have we known
each other, Joseph?

31:13.674 --> 31:16.009
Ooh! Well, over 40 years, sir.

31:16.043 --> 31:17.911
We've always got along
pretty well, haven't we?

31:17.945 --> 31:20.113
Yes, sir, I think so.

31:20.147 --> 31:23.917
In fact, I think you might well
be my best friend, Joseph.

31:25.986 --> 31:28.355
Thank you, sir. I'm...

31:30.223 --> 31:31.892
I'm very touched.

31:33.994 --> 31:37.197
- So why start lying to me now?
- I'm sorry, sir?

31:37.230 --> 31:39.667
Sorry's not good enough, Joseph.

31:39.700 --> 31:42.035
- This is betrayal.
- Sir Michael.

31:42.069 --> 31:43.737
The girl, Joseph.

31:44.572 --> 31:47.107
Don't piss about.

31:47.140 --> 31:50.978
Well, I just thought
you'd both be well suited.

31:52.312 --> 31:54.582
You must admit, she's perked you up.

31:54.615 --> 31:57.651
And all that Shakespeare,
she speaks it, too.

31:58.952 --> 32:00.954
So we speak the same language, yeah?

32:00.988 --> 32:02.956
Yes, sir, that's about it.

32:03.657 --> 32:04.725
Hmm...

32:05.392 --> 32:06.660
I'll...

32:11.131 --> 32:12.533
Joseph.

32:12.566 --> 32:16.103
When you put manure around the roses,
does it make them grow?

32:16.136 --> 32:20.407
- Oh! Yes, sir.
- But it smells, Joseph. Stinks.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.544
- I dare say, sir.
- This Burrito business stinks.

32:24.712 --> 32:26.980
Stinks of conspiracy to me.

32:27.715 --> 32:29.082
Just like any play.

32:30.584 --> 32:32.686
What's that?
Something you said to me once.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.281
"Great dramatists and
great actors conspire

32:35.283 --> 32:37.559
to blow up complacency, corruption,

32:37.591 --> 32:42.596
"pretension, all the vices of
our rich, sordid, jaded world.

32:42.630 --> 32:48.201
"With humor, passion and, wherever
possible, a large dollop of sex."

32:48.235 --> 32:50.704
- Did I really say that?
- I wrote it down.

32:50.738 --> 32:52.806
Oh God. You must let me have a copy.

32:53.974 --> 32:56.544
I haven't said anything
that good for years.

32:56.577 --> 32:59.513
'Tis much he dares, and, to that
dauntless temper of his mind,

32:59.547 --> 33:02.883
he hath a wisdom that doth guide
his valor to act in safety.

33:02.916 --> 33:05.118
There is none but he
whose being I do fear,

33:05.152 --> 33:08.789
and, under him My genius is rebuked,

33:08.822 --> 33:11.424
as it is said Mark Antony's
was by Caesar.

33:11.458 --> 33:12.793
He chid the sisters

33:12.826 --> 33:14.361
when first they put
the name of king upon me.

33:14.394 --> 33:16.830
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.566
- Much improvement since last time.
- Thank you.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.835
Next.

33:21.869 --> 33:24.037
Dorottya Horvat.

33:24.071 --> 33:25.138
You're next.

33:25.939 --> 33:27.508
Good luck.

33:32.646 --> 33:33.981
How are you?

33:34.014 --> 33:34.731
Good, thank you.

33:34.733 --> 33:36.885
Jolly spiffing, tickety boo,
never better.

33:36.917 --> 33:38.986
And you?

33:39.019 --> 33:42.556
We're a bit tired, late in the day.

33:42.590 --> 33:46.026
But I'm sure you'll
jolt us back to life.

33:46.059 --> 33:50.497
Let's see, you're Hungarian,
you did some acting in Budapest,

33:50.531 --> 33:52.365
and we liked you.

33:52.399 --> 33:56.336
But we had some concern about
the level of your English.

33:56.369 --> 33:59.507
I think my pronunciation has
improved a lot since then.

33:59.540 --> 34:01.141
I'm not surprised.

34:01.174 --> 34:03.744
It says here that you're being
tutored by Sir Michael Gifford.

34:03.777 --> 34:05.979
See, I am actually not being...

34:06.013 --> 34:07.815
I saw in the paper this morning

34:07.848 --> 34:09.139
Sir Michael's getting a Lifetime

34:09.141 --> 34:11.018
Achievement Award from
the Critics' Guild.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.887
Do pass on our
congratulations, won't you?

34:13.920 --> 34:15.856
Now, last time you did
Shakespeare pieces.

34:15.889 --> 34:18.391
This time I'd like you to improvise.

34:18.425 --> 34:22.862
Invent a character, and let
us see her secret thoughts.

34:22.896 --> 34:26.498
That'll be easier in terms
of your accent as well.

34:26.534 --> 34:30.170
Both for Shakespeare and for us.

34:30.203 --> 34:32.438
Why don't you do someone with an accent?

34:32.472 --> 34:34.641
Zsa Zsa Gabor, for example?

34:36.643 --> 34:38.110
No.

34:38.145 --> 34:42.550
Actually, I'll be
Professor Henrietta Higgins.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.418
And what do you teach,
my dear professor?

34:45.452 --> 34:48.856
Diction. And proper
English pronunciation.

34:48.889 --> 34:51.424
For girls with strong accents.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.694
I have no more questions then.

34:53.726 --> 34:56.196
Two minutes, my dear Professor Higgins.

35:04.872 --> 35:06.740
It's been a long day.

35:07.641 --> 35:09.877
A little talent.

35:09.910 --> 35:12.780
But so many who have no
idea of what it takes.

35:14.047 --> 35:16.817
Look at this one, for example...

35:16.850 --> 35:20.521
She says in her application
that she's an actress.

35:20.554 --> 35:22.823
In Budapest or Bucharest?

35:23.791 --> 35:25.358
What's the difference, anyway?

35:26.894 --> 35:29.062
Have they even got a theater there?

35:29.096 --> 35:30.564
Although, come to think of it,

35:30.598 --> 35:33.333
that Molnar fellow,
he was a Hungarian, right?

35:33.366 --> 35:36.269
The one who wrote that,
um, that Carousel.

35:36.303 --> 35:41.675
Well, I was in that one, playing
that famous actress, Ilona.

35:41.709 --> 35:46.379
I was pretty good in that.
Well, I was absolutely fantastic.

35:46.413 --> 35:48.481
That Molnar fellow,
he could really write.

35:48.516 --> 35:51.985
But who has ever heard
of a Hungarian actress?

35:52.019 --> 35:54.354
Oh, yeah, Zsa Zsa Gabor, of course.

35:56.323 --> 35:59.292
And Eva Gabor and Magda Gabor.

35:59.326 --> 36:01.962
But that's one family.
Is that really it?

36:04.331 --> 36:08.101
I mean, they're hardly
the bloody Redgraves. Right?

36:09.937 --> 36:11.839
Dorottya!

36:11.872 --> 36:15.008
Where's that bloody girl?
She's never here when I need her.

36:15.042 --> 36:17.377
She went to visit her uncle.
You let her go.

36:17.410 --> 36:20.180
Look.
Oh, it's sweet.

36:20.213 --> 36:21.849
Remind you of anyone?

36:24.317 --> 36:26.353
I'm glad you like her.

36:26.386 --> 36:29.456
She's the first one you don't
seem to mind having around.

36:29.489 --> 36:30.958
Milly.

36:30.991 --> 36:32.325
Don't tell me you're jealous.

36:32.359 --> 36:34.762
No, of course I'm not.
I just...

36:34.795 --> 36:38.666
I don't exactly see what you see in her.

36:38.699 --> 36:40.534
She has fire in her belly.

36:41.902 --> 36:45.038
She reminds me of myself at that age.

36:45.072 --> 36:48.676
A mixture of innocence,
hunger, and ruthlessness.

36:50.043 --> 36:52.580
And me? What did you see in me?

36:54.347 --> 36:56.349
Well, first of all,

36:57.450 --> 36:59.286
your arse.

36:59.319 --> 37:05.058
And then, I would have sold
my soul to find out if your

37:05.092 --> 37:07.828
breasts were pear or apple-shaped.
Yeah.

37:07.830 --> 37:08.897
Oh, really?

37:09.830 --> 37:11.599
And what were they?

37:11.632 --> 37:13.901
Golden delicious.

37:13.934 --> 37:17.104
Topped off with ripe strawberries.

37:18.205 --> 37:21.575
Strawberries? Indeed.
Not anymore.

37:21.609 --> 37:23.577
Very ripe.

37:23.611 --> 37:27.014
When I saw you, I fell in love with you.
I know I did.

37:28.215 --> 37:29.382
Straight off, just like that.

37:31.552 --> 37:33.887
All my life I have been
hiding my feelings.

37:33.921 --> 37:37.625
I just heard the news.
Congratulations. Thank you.

37:40.928 --> 37:43.063
Got out of the habit of doing
anything real.

37:44.231 --> 37:46.433
What does it feel like,
watching yourself?

37:46.466 --> 37:48.969
Acutely depressing.

37:49.002 --> 37:52.973
Like looking at a mirror that
reflects what you used to be.

37:53.006 --> 37:56.476
A kind of inverted Dorian Gray.

37:56.510 --> 37:59.813
They've asked for some clips
to be used at the ceremony.

38:01.649 --> 38:02.816
What's that?

38:03.517 --> 38:05.653
More nappies?

38:05.686 --> 38:10.824
"That great baby you see there is not
yet out of his swaddling clouts."

38:10.858 --> 38:13.260
"Happily he's the second time
come to them,

38:13.293 --> 38:16.029
"for they say an old man
is twice a child."

38:16.063 --> 38:17.931
Actually, it's toilet paper.

38:17.965 --> 38:21.401
Speaking my language, eh?
I don't know what you mean.

38:21.434 --> 38:23.303
All that Shakespeare bollocks.

38:23.336 --> 38:25.072
It's contagious.

38:25.105 --> 38:27.107
Well, I certainly hope so.

38:29.309 --> 38:30.878
Quite right.

38:33.681 --> 38:37.050
And talking of toilet paper, would you
please be so kind as to make sure

38:37.084 --> 38:40.954
the paper unrolls over the top of the
roller, and not from the bottom?

38:40.988 --> 38:42.923
I don't know how many times
I have to tell you,

38:42.956 --> 38:44.958
but you keep putting it the wrong way.

38:44.992 --> 38:48.428
- I swear you've never mentioned it.
- I did, you know.

38:48.461 --> 38:51.364
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did, Dorottya.

38:51.398 --> 38:53.300
- No, you did not.
- I did.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.537
- No, you didn't!
- I did, too, you Romanian bitch!

38:56.570 --> 38:57.871
Hungarian!
I'm Hungarian!

38:57.905 --> 38:59.940
I know you're a fucking Hungarian!

38:59.973 --> 39:01.742
You keep fucking telling me!

39:01.775 --> 39:04.912
I keep fucking telling you because
you keep fucking forgetting!

39:11.752 --> 39:14.588
Your English has come on
since you've been here.

39:14.622 --> 39:15.956
Thank you.

39:15.989 --> 39:17.991
I'm sorry.
But you deserved it.

39:19.192 --> 39:22.029
Very possibly.
But just do it my way.

39:23.664 --> 39:25.599
All right?

39:25.633 --> 39:27.234
No problem.

39:32.706 --> 39:36.043
So, will you go to the award thing?

39:36.076 --> 39:39.012
Sophia thinks I shouldn't,
of course, but...

39:41.214 --> 39:44.384
You know, comme ci,
comme ca, and all that.

39:44.417 --> 39:46.086
Well, I think you should go.

39:50.624 --> 39:54.227
I'd have to make a fucking speech.

39:54.261 --> 39:57.030
Making speeches is your strong suit.

39:57.064 --> 39:59.567
It might be like
attending my own funeral.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.168
I would love that.

40:01.201 --> 40:03.871
Hear all those nice things that
people have to say about me.

40:03.904 --> 40:05.272
You'd be lucky.

40:05.305 --> 40:07.841
I rang The Times once
and asked to see my obituary.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.442
The buggers refused.

40:09.476 --> 40:12.412
They never reveal anything
prior to publication.

40:12.445 --> 40:14.648
You see? That's exactly
why you should go.

40:14.682 --> 40:16.349
Otherwise it will be too late.

40:30.230 --> 40:31.298
Hmm...

42:42.730 --> 42:43.764
Dorottya!

42:54.207 --> 42:57.044
It will do you good to
get out of your gilded cage for once.

42:57.077 --> 42:59.547
Quite right.

42:59.580 --> 43:03.283
I don't suppose Milly will like it.
Who the fuck cares?

43:03.316 --> 43:05.285
She doesn't need to know.

43:05.318 --> 43:08.321
Today is market day.
She won't be back till the afternoon.

43:11.491 --> 43:15.262
You know, maybe I oughtn't
to be seen in a wheelchair.

43:29.209 --> 43:31.244
Just wait a second.

43:42.455 --> 43:46.694
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

43:48.395 --> 43:51.098
Oh! Piss off!

43:51.131 --> 43:54.735
I'm perfectly capable of sitting
at a table alone, thank you.

43:56.770 --> 43:58.405
- Sir Michael.
- George.

43:58.438 --> 44:00.007
You're looking well.

44:00.040 --> 44:02.676
Jolly spiffing, tickety
boo, never better.

44:02.710 --> 44:03.977
Thank you.

44:04.011 --> 44:06.079
You don't know how much people miss you.

44:06.113 --> 44:07.347
You were our main attraction,

44:07.380 --> 44:08.582
if you don't mind me saying so.

44:08.616 --> 44:11.685
Perhaps I should charge
appearance money.

44:11.719 --> 44:15.088
- Are you keeping busy, sir?
- Oh! Don't ask.

44:15.122 --> 44:16.690
I've taken on a new secretary.

44:16.724 --> 44:19.192
Name's Tortilla.
She's Bulgarian.

44:19.226 --> 44:22.796
So what's it to be, sir? The usual?
Yes, please, George.

44:27.535 --> 44:29.202
Oh, uh...

44:29.236 --> 44:32.205
I don't make the law, Sir Michael.
I just have to obey it.

44:34.174 --> 44:36.243
Understood.
Understood.

44:39.813 --> 44:40.981
Cunt.

44:41.014 --> 44:42.182
Hmm?

44:42.215 --> 44:45.352
Kant. Immanuel Kant.

44:45.385 --> 44:48.522
Famous outdoor smoker and philosopher.

44:50.658 --> 44:52.926
Keep the change.

44:52.960 --> 44:55.228
Oh, thank you, miss.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

44:56.930 --> 44:59.166
And just for future reference,

45:00.100 --> 45:01.334
my name is Peter.

45:08.642 --> 45:10.644
He seems a nice man.

45:11.612 --> 45:13.113
- Who?
- George.

45:14.948 --> 45:18.752
He's a pub landlord.
They're written that way.

45:18.786 --> 45:20.954
It's like saying Romeo is good
at chatting up the girls,

45:20.988 --> 45:25.192
Hamlet is a bit indecisive,
and Lear is a grumpy old fart.

45:25.225 --> 45:27.695
They say your Lear
was absolutely terrific.

45:27.728 --> 45:29.730
From the heart, born to play it.

45:30.631 --> 45:32.199
All right. All right.

45:34.101 --> 45:36.770
- Where's my change?
- No change.

45:36.804 --> 45:37.971
I gave him a tip.

45:39.406 --> 45:40.908
Quite right.

45:41.909 --> 45:44.277
Can't have them saying I'm mean.

46:05.332 --> 46:07.935
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my God!

46:07.968 --> 46:09.803
Sir Michael!

46:09.837 --> 46:11.004
What's happened?

46:12.239 --> 46:14.542
Come along. Oh, dear.

46:14.575 --> 46:18.311
- He only had one drink.
- Michael, are you all right?

46:18.345 --> 46:19.680
What the hell is going on?

46:21.114 --> 46:22.583
Michael!

46:22.616 --> 46:24.918
How dare you take him out of the house!

46:24.952 --> 46:26.587
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

46:26.620 --> 46:28.956
- Is that all you've got to say?
- Oh, dear. It's all right.

46:31.124 --> 46:32.311
What has he had to drink?

46:32.313 --> 46:34.495
Whiskey and soda.
That's what he wanted.

46:34.528 --> 46:37.364
Whatever appalling training you
might've had, surely you know

46:37.397 --> 46:40.668
not to give alcohol
to a patient on medication.

46:40.701 --> 46:41.969
Whether he wants it or not!

46:42.002 --> 46:44.505
Maybe not. But when have you
seen Michael this happy?

46:44.538 --> 46:47.107
"Sir Michael" to you!

46:47.140 --> 46:49.309
Michael, did you fall out?

46:49.342 --> 46:52.613
Okay, I'll take it
from here. I'll take it.

47:12.666 --> 47:14.401
Ugh.

47:14.434 --> 47:17.170
- Will you answer that?
- It's probably another bloody reporter.

47:17.204 --> 47:17.969
Tell them to piss off.

47:17.971 --> 47:19.708
He's not going, he's
not making any comment,

47:19.740 --> 47:21.575
and he won't be posing
for any photographs.

47:25.846 --> 47:27.948
Hello, this is Sir Michael
Gifford's residence.

47:27.981 --> 47:29.883
I'm sorry but Sir Michael
can't come to...

47:33.621 --> 47:35.222
Yes.

47:35.255 --> 47:38.626
Yes, hello, Mrs. Henderson.

47:38.659 --> 47:41.094
No, I'm afraid Sir Michael can't
come to the phone right now.

47:41.128 --> 47:42.730
It's me, Dorottya.

47:45.432 --> 47:47.768
I can pass the message on.

47:48.936 --> 47:52.172
I'll let you know.
Okay. Thank you.

47:53.507 --> 47:54.642
Bye-bye.

47:55.408 --> 47:56.510
Who is Mrs. Henderson?

47:58.879 --> 48:02.482
She's the administrator at the
London School of Dramatic Arts.

48:02.516 --> 48:04.017
And why does she know you?

48:04.952 --> 48:09.022
Because I applied there.

48:09.056 --> 48:11.892
And I had to give them some
kind of an address, right?

48:13.827 --> 48:14.995
Right.

48:21.334 --> 48:22.703
Wonderful day.

48:29.076 --> 48:30.578
So, you started writing your memoirs?

48:30.611 --> 48:33.480
Not at all.
This is my speech.

48:33.514 --> 48:37.250
- What speech?
- For the award thingy.

48:37.284 --> 48:42.189
You're not serious.
I've never been more serious in my life.

48:42.222 --> 48:45.993
You know, Milly, I've always
wanted to say that line.

48:46.026 --> 48:48.228
And in my entire career
I never once did.

48:48.261 --> 48:49.897
But, Michael, they're not expecting you.

48:49.930 --> 48:51.965
Well, then they're in
for a pleasant surprise.

48:51.999 --> 48:53.701
You can't possibly be serious.
Ah!

48:53.734 --> 48:55.803
I've never been more serious...
What does Sophia say?

48:55.836 --> 48:58.105
Well, when I tell her, she'll
be against it, of course.

48:58.138 --> 49:00.173
Not that I give a fuck.

49:00.207 --> 49:01.125
And Dorottya?

49:01.127 --> 49:03.878
Oh, wildly enthusiastic
about the idea.

49:05.278 --> 49:07.114
In fact, when I think about it,

49:07.147 --> 49:09.216
she might have even suggested
it in the first place.

49:09.249 --> 49:11.719
Mad.
Mad. Mad. Mad.

49:11.752 --> 49:16.056
"When the wind is southerly she
knows a hawk from a handsaw."

49:17.124 --> 49:19.660
Do you know a hawk from a handsaw?

49:19.693 --> 49:21.328
I doubt it.

49:22.596 --> 49:23.664
Afternoon, miss.

49:23.697 --> 49:25.265
Afternoon.
Afternoon.

49:27.434 --> 49:29.570
You wanted to see me.

49:29.603 --> 49:31.271
Why here?

49:31.304 --> 49:33.574
Because I don't want you in the house.

49:33.607 --> 49:36.009
This meeting is to end your employment.

49:36.043 --> 49:36.493
What?

49:36.495 --> 49:37.846
I want you out.

49:37.878 --> 49:40.581
Out of the house,
out of my father's life.

49:40.614 --> 49:42.315
- But why?
- I don't want to discuss it.

49:42.349 --> 49:43.984
My decision is final.

49:44.017 --> 49:47.320
I've taken legal advice, and if
you ever go near my father again,

49:47.354 --> 49:49.723
I will call the police
and get a restraining order.

49:49.757 --> 49:52.025
But I don't understand,
what have I done wrong?

49:52.059 --> 49:54.995
You've been ingratiating yourself with
my father ever since you moved in.

49:55.028 --> 49:56.730
That's my job.

49:56.764 --> 49:58.866
Telling him how great he is, how
he's still fit to be seen in public.

49:59.867 --> 50:02.670
- The award?
- Exactly.

50:02.703 --> 50:04.805
It was like a dying request.
How could I refuse?

50:04.838 --> 50:06.173
You put it in his head.

50:06.206 --> 50:08.108
I'm sure Dorottya means well, Sophia.

50:08.141 --> 50:10.377
But I must say, we're really very
disappointed in you, Dorottya.

50:10.410 --> 50:12.713
You know better than anyone what
could happen to him on stage.

50:12.746 --> 50:14.882
What if his bladder were to give way?
Or his bowels?

50:14.915 --> 50:16.517
Alastair, please.

50:16.550 --> 50:18.385
- Didn't you ever stop to consider that?
- Of course I did.

50:18.418 --> 50:20.053
But when I saw how much he wanted it,

50:20.087 --> 50:21.488
I thought it was worth the risk.

50:21.522 --> 50:23.256
Worth the risk?

50:23.290 --> 50:27.294
Of a great actor being remembered for
a catastrophic last performance?

50:27.327 --> 50:29.229
There's nothing the world
loves more than a car crash.

50:29.262 --> 50:32.499
Milly has already packed your things,
and Joseph has them in the car outside.

50:32.533 --> 50:34.635
He'll take you back to the nursing home.

50:34.668 --> 50:37.270
This is what we owe you.
And one week extra.

50:37.304 --> 50:39.740
And remember your
confidentiality agreement.

50:39.773 --> 50:42.743
If you go to the press I will sue
you for everything you've got.

50:42.776 --> 50:46.880
- Everything I've got?
- This and the two suitcases in the car.

50:46.914 --> 50:48.348
Well, good luck with that.

51:10.270 --> 51:13.273
- You think I was wrong, don't you?
- No.

51:15.576 --> 51:18.679
You did what you thought was right.
I did what he wanted.

51:22.315 --> 51:25.085
We both know, he'd never
have got through it.

51:25.118 --> 51:27.955
So you think he should
just get used to dying?

51:31.124 --> 51:34.127
After a certain age,
that's what life is.

51:35.395 --> 51:36.930
Getting used to things.

51:39.567 --> 51:41.234
Not for him.

51:56.449 --> 51:59.953
- Well, what is it?
- Daddy, we have to talk.

52:01.922 --> 52:04.825
Where's Dorottya?

52:04.858 --> 52:07.360
She should have been back
from the village hours ago.

52:07.394 --> 52:09.630
That's what we've come to talk about.

52:09.663 --> 52:10.698
Dorottya's gone.

52:12.165 --> 52:15.002
- What do you mean, gone?
- I've sacked her.

52:16.369 --> 52:18.005
What?

52:18.038 --> 52:22.409
What fucking right had you
to do such a thing?

52:22.442 --> 52:26.413
What right? May I remind you,
I was the one who hired her.

52:26.446 --> 52:30.618
And may I remind you,

52:30.651 --> 52:33.020
this is my house!

52:33.053 --> 52:36.590
And in my house,
even in my fucking garden,

52:36.624 --> 52:38.391
I make the decisions. Me.

52:38.425 --> 52:40.928
- If I may just...
- Alastair, not now.

52:40.961 --> 52:44.632
You don't realize.
Dorottya is not what she seems.

52:44.665 --> 52:48.636
She is thoroughly untrustable.
"Detested kite! Thou liest!

52:51.805 --> 52:56.744
"My train are men of choice
and rarest parts

52:56.777 --> 53:00.147
"That all particulars of duty know.

53:01.849 --> 53:03.083
"O, Lear.

53:04.384 --> 53:05.819
"Lear!"

53:05.853 --> 53:08.055
Really, Daddy.
You're not helping matters by...

53:08.088 --> 53:09.590
"Lear!

53:12.626 --> 53:15.495
"Hear, Nature, hear,

53:15.529 --> 53:18.498
"dear goddess, hear!

53:19.633 --> 53:22.235
"Suspend thy purpose

53:22.269 --> 53:27.274
"if thou didst intend to
make this creature fruitful!

53:27.307 --> 53:31.311
"Into her womb convey sterility.

53:31.344 --> 53:34.648
"Dry up in her the organs of increase,

53:34.682 --> 53:38.786
"And from her derogate body never spring

53:38.819 --> 53:40.888
"A babe to honor her.

53:42.656 --> 53:48.261
"If she must teem,
create her child of spleen,

53:48.295 --> 53:53.233
"that it may live to be a thwart
disnatured torment to her!

53:53.266 --> 53:58.839
"That she may feel how sharper
than a serpent's tooth it is

53:58.872 --> 54:02.375
"to have a thankless child."

54:16.890 --> 54:18.759
Thank God you're here.
He's still unconscious.

54:18.792 --> 54:22.262
Joseph! Where the hell has he gone to?

54:47.320 --> 54:51.792
Joseph, please stop the car.
I'll just get out here.

54:51.825 --> 54:53.160
Are you going to be all right, miss?

54:55.829 --> 54:57.330
Yes.

54:58.866 --> 55:00.267
You're not sure, are you?

55:03.136 --> 55:05.138
Where would you like to go, miss?

55:05.172 --> 55:06.674
Of course, his blood pressure
was already very high

55:06.707 --> 55:09.009
and he'd worked himself up
into quite a state.

55:09.042 --> 55:12.546
Based upon his bloods,
I think we can rule out a TIA.

55:12.580 --> 55:14.848
Parkinson's is a complicating
factor, of course.

55:14.882 --> 55:17.250
- Yeah.
- But he's stable now, under sedation.

55:17.284 --> 55:19.419
- You gave him propofol?
- Only a low dose.

55:19.452 --> 55:23.390
By the way, I must ask,
is there any living will just in case?

55:23.423 --> 55:24.491
What did you just say?

56:12.540 --> 56:15.609
God...

56:29.790 --> 56:31.258
I still don't understand.

56:31.291 --> 56:35.596
The old man didn't have a word
about the bitch kicking you out?

56:35.629 --> 56:36.997
Well, apparently not.

56:37.030 --> 56:39.332
I mean, he hasn't called,
he hasn't texted me.

56:39.366 --> 56:42.369
Obviously, he doesn't want me back.

56:42.402 --> 56:44.572
- He sounds like your boyfriend.
- No.

56:44.605 --> 56:46.907
- Call him!
- No, I am not going to call him.

56:46.940 --> 56:49.042
- Call him.
- No.

57:49.570 --> 57:50.771
Hello.

57:53.741 --> 57:56.009
I usually do my own makeup.

57:58.011 --> 57:59.254
Good morning.

57:59.256 --> 58:02.984
Just a little glycerin for your lips.

58:03.016 --> 58:03.725
Good morning.

58:03.727 --> 58:05.854
Oh! Good God, there's two of them.

58:05.886 --> 58:07.655
You know, you really
don't need your monitor.

58:07.688 --> 58:10.190
We can hear your snoring from
the other end of the ward.

58:10.891 --> 58:13.260
Where's my gizmo?

58:13.293 --> 58:14.418
Your mobile?

58:14.420 --> 58:15.263
Ah!

58:15.295 --> 58:15.871
You dropped it.

58:15.873 --> 58:17.599
Don't worry, it didn't
break or anything,

58:17.631 --> 58:19.733
but I've put it in the
nurses' room to recharge it.

58:19.767 --> 58:21.802
You're welcome to borrow mine.

58:21.835 --> 58:26.840
Unfortunately, the number I want is
in the phone's memory, not mine.

58:28.408 --> 58:30.377
Well, they are bound
to ask you for another girl.

58:30.410 --> 58:32.680
Maybe when she leaves
I could take her place here?

58:32.713 --> 58:34.982
I'm afraid Sir Michael doesn't
need anyone for the time being.

58:35.015 --> 58:36.717
But even if he is allowed
to go back home,

58:36.750 --> 58:39.452
they'll no longer be requiring the
services of any of our girls.

58:39.486 --> 58:40.104
Wait, wait, wait.

58:40.106 --> 58:41.956
What do you mean by
"allowed to go back home"?

58:43.490 --> 58:44.692
He's in hospital.

58:52.600 --> 58:54.502
Sir Michael had a heart attack.

58:57.004 --> 58:58.906
Do you have any numbers
of hospitals nearby?

58:58.939 --> 59:01.775
They won't help you.
Not unless you are family.

59:07.648 --> 59:10.183
Yes, hello. This is
Allison Morley speaking.

59:10.217 --> 59:12.520
Hello.
I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.

59:12.553 --> 59:15.656
I'm on a satellite phone from Cambodia.
I can't hear you.

59:16.924 --> 59:18.425
Hello?

59:19.259 --> 59:21.795
Hello? Hello?

59:21.829 --> 59:24.331
I'm trying to locate my grandfather,
Sir Michael Gifford.

59:24.364 --> 59:25.432
Is he there?

59:28.335 --> 59:29.870
Thank you very much.

59:32.773 --> 59:33.807
Milly.

59:34.575 --> 59:36.276
Milly. Milly.

59:39.212 --> 59:41.214
Milly, where the hell are you?

59:45.553 --> 59:49.990
"No harm. I have
done nothing but care of thee,

59:50.023 --> 59:53.794
"Of thee, my dear one,
thee, my daughter."

01:00:04.437 --> 01:00:09.843
I've had heart attacks on film,
on stage, once on Radio 4.

01:00:09.877 --> 01:00:12.245
But never any as realistic as this.

01:00:12.279 --> 01:00:13.947
You scared the hell
out of Sophia and me.

01:00:13.981 --> 01:00:17.117
Milly, please don't start again.

01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:22.155
I have apologized.
I am profoundly sorry.

01:00:22.189 --> 01:00:24.391
And I'm sorry, too.

01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:26.059
It was a foolish idea to suggest that

01:00:26.093 --> 01:00:28.195
you should come to the
ceremony in the first place.

01:00:28.228 --> 01:00:31.732
Foolish or selfish?
Stop fucking quarrelling.

01:00:32.533 --> 01:00:34.401
I have decided to go.

01:00:34.434 --> 01:00:38.606
I have decided, period.
But you're not up to it.

01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:41.842
The show must go on.

01:00:41.875 --> 01:00:44.411
Oh! Another one of those wonderful
lines I have always wanted to say.

01:00:44.444 --> 01:00:45.230
"The show must go on."

01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:47.015
It's the most idiotic
thing I've ever heard.

01:00:47.047 --> 01:00:50.017
After all the years with me,
Milly? It's just one of many.

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:52.185
But, Michael, you've had
hundreds of awards.

01:00:52.219 --> 01:00:54.354
Twenty three.
But who's counting?

01:00:54.387 --> 01:00:55.772
That's what I mean.
Why would you want to

01:00:55.774 --> 01:00:57.125
jeopardize everything for just one more?

01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:59.492
Because, my dear Milly,

01:01:00.828 --> 01:01:02.996
this is the last one.

01:01:04.598 --> 01:01:07.400
The last one.

01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:12.873
There are two important ones in a
man's life, the first and the last.

01:01:12.906 --> 01:01:13.907
Mmm...

01:01:14.975 --> 01:01:17.511
And I don't just mean awards.

01:01:17.545 --> 01:01:21.381
For God's sake, Michael, be
serious, just for one moment.

01:01:23.483 --> 01:01:26.219
Are you certain that you're up to it?

01:01:26.253 --> 01:01:28.622
Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful day.

01:01:28.656 --> 01:01:33.060
I've never been more certain
of anything in my life.

01:01:36.664 --> 01:01:38.999
Help me. Please, Milly.

01:01:43.504 --> 01:01:45.072
Of course I will.

01:01:45.806 --> 01:01:47.541
Thank you.

01:01:47.575 --> 01:01:51.178
And we mustn't tell Sophia.
She'd only try and stop me.

01:01:51.211 --> 01:01:53.213
And she'd be right.

01:01:59.587 --> 01:02:02.089
And now, my darling,

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:05.292
I'd like to have a word with
this young lady in private.

01:02:10.764 --> 01:02:12.800
All right.

01:02:12.833 --> 01:02:14.467
All right, but don't...

01:02:14.502 --> 01:02:16.436
Fine.

01:02:22.576 --> 01:02:24.712
I want you to go with me
to the ceremony.

01:02:27.047 --> 01:02:29.583
You don't need me.

01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:32.986
Milly should go.
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

01:02:34.221 --> 01:02:37.424
But I need you, too.

01:02:37.457 --> 01:02:39.627
All right. But first
we have to make sure

01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:42.930
that you can manage a performance
without crapping yourself.

01:02:43.997 --> 01:02:45.065
Mmm!

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:47.635
And how do we do that?

01:02:47.668 --> 01:02:49.136
The day after tomorrow,

01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:50.971
come to the care home
and give them a recital.

01:02:54.808 --> 01:02:56.766
They've all got Alzheimer's.

01:02:56.768 --> 01:02:57.746
So what?

01:02:57.778 --> 01:03:00.080
They'll say they've never seen
anything like this before.

01:03:02.115 --> 01:03:03.116
And if I shit myself?

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:05.119
I really think they're used to that.

01:03:19.332 --> 01:03:21.635
- What's this?
- It's a car.

01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.437
Really?

01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:26.907
The steering is on the wrong side.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.441
No, it's actually on the right side.

01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:29.777
Which happens to be the left.

01:03:33.313 --> 01:03:34.815
You old bastard.

01:03:34.848 --> 01:03:38.185
How the hell did you end up
here in the Garden of England?

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.121
You didn't tell me about him.

01:03:41.154 --> 01:03:43.223
Because I didn't know
that you knew each other.

01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:48.729
What a time.
What a time.

01:03:48.762 --> 01:03:52.032
It's time to go.
Okay. On with the motley.

01:03:58.438 --> 01:04:00.240
What is going on here?

01:04:00.273 --> 01:04:01.909
Dorottya! I thought I told you...

01:04:01.942 --> 01:04:04.512
You must be the admirable Mrs. Trudeau.

01:04:04.545 --> 01:04:05.779
I am. And who...

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.248
Oh!

01:04:08.281 --> 01:04:12.553
Sir Michael Gifford at
your disposal, ma'am.

01:04:12.586 --> 01:04:14.855
I thought you were ill.
Quite so.

01:04:14.888 --> 01:04:18.659
Quite so, but this young lady
has miraculously revived me.

01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:21.194
Well, that is excellent.

01:04:21.228 --> 01:04:25.065
She has also persuaded me that the
residents of your home will offer

01:04:25.098 --> 01:04:29.136
the best possible audience for what
is likely to prove my farewell

01:04:29.169 --> 01:04:32.139
and final performance as King Lear.

01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:36.243
By all means, Sir Michael.

01:04:36.276 --> 01:04:38.679
This is a great privilege.

01:04:39.913 --> 01:04:41.749
Indeed it is.

01:04:44.284 --> 01:04:48.789
How does my royal Lord?
How fares your Majesty?

01:04:48.822 --> 01:04:51.859
You do me wrong
to take me out o' the grave.

01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:57.865
Thou art a soul in bliss,

01:04:57.898 --> 01:05:01.669
but I am bound upon a wheel of fire,

01:05:01.702 --> 01:05:05.739
that mine own tears
do scald like molten lead.

01:05:07.374 --> 01:05:09.710
Sir, do you know me?

01:05:11.712 --> 01:05:14.147
You are a spirit, I know.

01:05:15.482 --> 01:05:17.017
When did you die?

01:05:19.152 --> 01:05:22.656
Still, still far wide!

01:05:27.194 --> 01:05:29.029
Where have I been?

01:05:30.363 --> 01:05:31.699
Where am I?

01:05:34.602 --> 01:05:36.604
Fair daylight?

01:05:39.139 --> 01:05:42.009
Oh, I am mightily abused.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:47.314
I should even die with pity
to see another thus.

01:05:49.449 --> 01:05:51.852
O, look upon me, sir,

01:05:51.885 --> 01:05:54.855
and hold your hands
in benediction o'er me.

01:06:02.362 --> 01:06:04.532
No, sir, you must not kneel.

01:06:05.398 --> 01:06:08.536
I pray, do not mock me.

01:06:09.837 --> 01:06:13.440
I am a very foolish fond old man,

01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:19.046
fourscore and upward,
not an hour more nor less.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:22.482
And to deal plainly with you

01:06:23.416 --> 01:06:27.220
I fear I am not in my perfect mind.

01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:31.258
Your sisters have, as I do
remember, done me wrong.

01:06:34.027 --> 01:06:36.296
You have some cause

01:06:37.631 --> 01:06:39.332
they have not.

01:06:39.366 --> 01:06:40.634
No cause.

01:06:45.405 --> 01:06:46.607
No cause.

01:07:00.888 --> 01:07:05.759
They rang from the academy to ask
if I was really tutoring you.

01:07:05.793 --> 01:07:07.995
I didn't say anything. I...
I said I was.

01:07:10.163 --> 01:07:11.799
Thank you.

01:07:14.735 --> 01:07:16.904
But I'm not really sure
that I still want it.

01:07:18.706 --> 01:07:21.909
You know, I think maybe it has been
enough to have acted with you.

01:07:21.942 --> 01:07:23.944
To have played the good girl.

01:07:25.746 --> 01:07:28.582
It was almost as if
my father had forgiven me.

01:07:31.552 --> 01:07:33.804
Was he the one who
directed the Hamlet?

01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:34.556
Yes.

01:07:36.023 --> 01:07:39.492
- Where'd you get these?
- From the care home.

01:07:39.527 --> 01:07:40.928
Mustard would have been nice.

01:07:44.798 --> 01:07:47.300
Why did you need him to forgive you?

01:07:49.637 --> 01:07:52.005
People think I lie all the time.

01:07:53.206 --> 01:07:55.876
But I've only told one lie.

01:07:58.679 --> 01:08:01.915
Which was...

01:08:01.949 --> 01:08:05.986
I told people I did things for my
father when he was sick that I hadn't.

01:08:13.727 --> 01:08:16.029
Life's like that.

01:08:16.063 --> 01:08:19.299
Great deeds, if you're lucky.

01:08:19.332 --> 01:08:23.336
And mistakes that make your
toes curl with embarrassment.

01:08:24.805 --> 01:08:26.974
Now.

01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:30.611
You must forgive yourself, and move on,

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:34.447
do better the next time.

01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:38.551
Your father was right.

01:08:39.752 --> 01:08:43.256
Acting isn't what we do,
it's what we are.

01:08:45.626 --> 01:08:47.627
Now, Dorottya,

01:08:49.496 --> 01:08:51.832
I'm sure your father would
be very proud of you.

01:08:57.037 --> 01:08:59.807
That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:03.109
Well, I always say,
"If the part demands it,

01:09:03.143 --> 01:09:06.145
"the setting is perfect,
and the lighting superb,

01:09:09.482 --> 01:09:10.984
"I can fake it."

01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:38.345
And now, live from London,
the Critics' Guild Annual Awards.

01:09:45.653 --> 01:09:48.522
My father's very sorry not to
be here in person tonight,

01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:51.124
but he is thrilled
to be getting this award

01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:55.028
and sends his very best wishes
to everyone at the Guild.

01:09:55.062 --> 01:09:57.464
Thank you.

01:09:57.497 --> 01:09:59.266
You know, I once met Adolph Zukor,

01:09:59.299 --> 01:10:01.068
the founder of Paramount Pictures.

01:10:01.101 --> 01:10:02.435
And a Hungarian.

01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:05.806
Don't fucking interrupt
with all that Hungarian crap!

01:10:05.839 --> 01:10:09.109
It was just before his 100th
birthday, and he said...

01:10:09.142 --> 01:10:11.078
"If I had known that
I was going to live this long,

01:10:11.111 --> 01:10:13.180
"I would have taken
better care of myself."

01:10:16.617 --> 01:10:18.385
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was that for your speech?

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.955
It doesn't matter.

01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:25.125
Your reply came from the Academy.

01:10:26.359 --> 01:10:28.228
It's over there,
in the jacket of my pocket.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.031
Jacket pocket.

01:10:33.133 --> 01:10:35.302
Okay. Later.

01:10:35.335 --> 01:10:37.404
- Don't you care?
- Of course, I do.

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.439
But this is your night.

01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:42.342
Let's get you dressed.

01:10:44.044 --> 01:10:46.046
There will be no nappy.

01:10:46.079 --> 01:10:50.083
Tonight I perform without a net.

01:10:53.153 --> 01:10:55.122
You look a bit pale.
Are you okay?

01:10:55.155 --> 01:10:58.391
Yes, I'm okay.
Don't keep asking.

01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:00.661
- Tell her, Joseph.
- Tell her what, sir?

01:11:00.694 --> 01:11:03.263
Tell her that I'm always
like this before I go on.

01:11:03.296 --> 01:11:07.735
It's true. Sir Michael's been
a martyr to stage fright.

01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:09.236
The famous Michael Gifford look

01:11:09.269 --> 01:11:12.405
comes from the fact I simply
can't face the bastards.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:15.108
I walk on, I can't see a
thing for the bloody lights.

01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:17.077
A trick of the trade, Dorottya,

01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:20.280
is to let your disadvantages
work for you.

01:11:20.313 --> 01:11:22.349
But, you know,
all the years I've known you,

01:11:22.382 --> 01:11:23.984
you never once dried up on stage.

01:11:24.017 --> 01:11:27.788
It's not drying I'm scared of,
it's wetting.

01:11:42.035 --> 01:11:43.904
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:43.937 --> 01:11:47.608
Tonight the Critics' Guild of
Great Britain is gathered to celebrate

01:11:47.641 --> 01:11:52.613
a giant of film, television,
and above all, theater.

01:11:52.646 --> 01:11:54.648
Sir Michael Gifford.

01:11:58.118 --> 01:12:01.321
Oh! Ah...

01:12:01.354 --> 01:12:03.390
So many memories.

01:12:04.291 --> 01:12:06.527
You know, Joseph,

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:10.798
Alzheimer's really should be
the province of the young.

01:12:10.831 --> 01:12:12.833
They have nothing to remember.

01:12:14.001 --> 01:12:17.137
How the fuck do they manage?

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.807
I really couldn't say, sir.
But, you know...

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.009
Yes.
When we were young,

01:12:23.944 --> 01:12:25.879
we seemed to manage quite well.

01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:28.215
Ah!

01:12:28.248 --> 01:12:30.117
Ammunition.

01:12:31.318 --> 01:12:33.020
All right.

01:12:33.053 --> 01:12:35.756
The young.
Screw them.

01:12:35.789 --> 01:12:37.691
And the begrudges, sir.

01:12:37.725 --> 01:12:39.660
To begin the proceedings, we have

01:12:39.693 --> 01:12:43.496
a special tribute tonight from
a distinguished fellow actor,

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.966
one of our greatest movie stars.

01:12:45.999 --> 01:12:48.936
Welcome, please, Sir Roger Moore.

01:12:50.938 --> 01:12:53.741
Welcome to my mountain retreat.

01:12:53.774 --> 01:12:56.043
My name is Moore.
Roger Moore.

01:12:56.076 --> 01:12:58.211
And I've come down from the mountain top

01:12:58.245 --> 01:13:03.350
to congratulate my old friend,
Michael, on yet another award.

01:13:03.383 --> 01:13:06.119
Some years ago Michael and I were making

01:13:06.153 --> 01:13:08.822
a dreadful piece of garbage
in the jungle

01:13:08.856 --> 01:13:10.858
calle The Saddest Lion.

01:13:11.625 --> 01:13:13.661
And in it...

01:13:13.694 --> 01:13:16.363
I've always meant to thank you, Joseph,

01:13:16.396 --> 01:13:19.867
for all the kindness you've
shown to me over the years.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.736
You really don't have to, sir.
It's been an honor.

01:13:24.404 --> 01:13:26.540
You're such a starfucker, Joseph.

01:13:26.574 --> 01:13:30.711
I bet when you get to heaven, you're
gonna ask God for His autograph.

01:13:30.744 --> 01:13:33.981
I believe you've said that
to me before, sir.

01:13:34.014 --> 01:13:35.182
At my age, Joseph,

01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:39.587
everything I say, I've said before.

01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:43.724
...and we got to talking about
the so called good old days,

01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:46.560
and I mentioned The Saddest Lion.

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:48.696
And Michael looked at me blankly.

01:13:48.729 --> 01:13:51.799
And he said,
"You mean, Villa in Antibes."

01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:55.402
No. This wasn't him.
That was Father's story about Larry.

01:13:55.435 --> 01:13:57.370
It doesn't matter,
Michael would love this.

01:13:57.404 --> 01:14:00.974
All of a sudden, Michael
burst into a great big grin.

01:14:01.008 --> 01:14:05.278
"The Saddest Lion,
I call A Villa in Antibes

01:14:05.312 --> 01:14:08.248
"because that's what it paid for."

01:14:13.253 --> 01:14:16.590
Michael, congratulations, my old mate.

01:14:22.696 --> 01:14:24.397
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:24.431 --> 01:14:27.668
Sadly, Sir Michael Gifford is unable
to be present in person tonight.

01:14:27.701 --> 01:14:29.578
But it gives me great pleasure to

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.173
introduce his beautiful
daughter, Sophia,

01:14:32.205 --> 01:14:34.508
who will receive
the award on his behalf.

01:14:53.326 --> 01:14:55.095
Thank you, Bernard.

01:14:55.128 --> 01:14:58.165
Thank you, Critics' Guild,
and thank you all.

01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:05.438
My father taught me to give the very
best to every endeavor I undertook.

01:15:06.139 --> 01:15:07.541
It's time.

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:09.543
Oh God.

01:15:11.779 --> 01:15:14.047
Two minutes.

01:15:14.081 --> 01:15:15.949
...but I have no doubt now that he
contributed enormously to my success.

01:15:16.984 --> 01:15:19.386
And as I grow older...
Joseph.

01:15:19.419 --> 01:15:23.657
...I come to understand the love
behind everything he asked of me.

01:15:23.691 --> 01:15:27.227
I also understand a little better how
much he's done for other people.

01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:28.629
I'll give you the nod.

01:15:28.662 --> 01:15:30.664
For all of the young writers, actors,

01:15:30.698 --> 01:15:32.700
and directors he has worked
with over the years.

01:15:33.734 --> 01:15:35.435
He had a glass of champagne.
Oh God.

01:15:35.468 --> 01:15:38.238
So I'd like to think that this
Lifetime Achievement Award

01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:41.341
is not just for my
father's performances,

01:15:41.374 --> 01:15:43.644
but for the achievements of his life.

01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:45.779
There we are, sir.

01:15:45.813 --> 01:15:50.317
Generosity to young talent is the
true spirit of my father's work.

01:15:50.350 --> 01:15:54.855
So tonight, I can announce a donation
from my own resources,

01:15:54.888 --> 01:15:59.593
of one million pounds to the
Sir Michael Gifford Theater Trust

01:15:59.627 --> 01:16:03.296
to ensure the continuation of
a cause close to my father's heart.

01:16:07.134 --> 01:16:10.337
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:10.370 --> 01:16:13.841
completely contrary to our expectations,

01:16:13.874 --> 01:16:16.109
I have a last surprise to announce.

01:16:16.143 --> 01:16:17.344
Milly, come on.

01:16:17.377 --> 01:16:19.146
It gives me great pleasure...

01:16:19.179 --> 01:16:21.381
I haven't missed an entrance in
my life and I don't want to start now.

01:16:21.414 --> 01:16:25.853
...to present the recipient of tonight's
Lifetime Achievement Award,

01:16:25.886 --> 01:16:28.556
my father, Sir Michael Gifford.

01:16:34.995 --> 01:16:40.067
I must say, my dear, even under
these unforgiving lights,

01:16:40.100 --> 01:16:42.369
your golden delicious
look quite magnificent.

01:16:42.402 --> 01:16:43.937
Michael!

01:17:14.668 --> 01:17:16.704
Got you.

01:17:16.737 --> 01:17:19.372
Only joking.
But it shut you up, didn't it?

01:17:20.974 --> 01:17:23.176
Now, sit down, sit down, sit down.

01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:24.678
One of us should be sitting quietly,

01:17:24.712 --> 01:17:27.247
and it's certainly not going to be me.

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.619
If you had given me
this thing a few years ago,

01:17:31.652 --> 01:17:35.623
I would have bounded heroically
onto the stage to receive it.

01:17:35.656 --> 01:17:38.959
They say that youth is
wasted on the young.

01:17:38.992 --> 01:17:42.029
Well, awards are surely
wasted on the old.

01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:45.332
I mean, it's always gonna be a toss-up,

01:17:45.365 --> 01:17:48.201
which would've made
the mantelpiece first.

01:17:48.235 --> 01:17:51.371
This or my ashes.

01:17:51.404 --> 01:17:54.307
Oh, don't worry.
I've died on stage many times.

01:17:54.341 --> 01:17:56.677
Sometimes it was even in the script.

01:17:56.710 --> 01:18:01.414
But I am not going
to die up here tonight.

01:18:03.617 --> 01:18:06.119
Now, did I hear my daughter right?

01:18:07.087 --> 01:18:08.355
A million pounds?

01:18:08.989 --> 01:18:10.390
Wow.

01:18:10.423 --> 01:18:13.060
And I can hardly get her
to buy me a drink.

01:18:13.093 --> 01:18:15.596
No, no, no, it's not true.

01:18:16.396 --> 01:18:18.365
It's not true.

01:18:18.398 --> 01:18:23.003
My daughter's quite a remarkable woman.

01:18:25.272 --> 01:18:27.474
You know,

01:18:27.508 --> 01:18:32.145
I had a little success a few years ago
playing King Lear.

01:18:33.614 --> 01:18:36.584
And like him, oh, dear,

01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:40.654
so much like him,

01:18:40.688 --> 01:18:43.657
I have misjudged my daughter.

01:18:43.691 --> 01:18:46.760
But no more, Sophia, no more.

01:18:48.428 --> 01:18:50.430
I am extremely proud of you.

01:18:51.298 --> 01:18:53.300
Please, come forward.

01:19:01.642 --> 01:19:04.444
Okay, that's enough.
It's my night.

01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:09.316
And I fully intend milking it
for all it's worth.

01:19:09.349 --> 01:19:10.651
Thank you, ladies.

01:19:14.487 --> 01:19:18.726
Like many actors I've often dreamed
of what I'd say on such an occasion.

01:19:18.759 --> 01:19:22.495
You know, perhaps obsequiously
thanking everybody.

01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:24.131
From the lady who cleans the toilet

01:19:24.164 --> 01:19:29.202
to the kindergarten graduates
who call themselves producers.

01:19:29.236 --> 01:19:32.439
Even pointing out the vindictive critic

01:19:32.472 --> 01:19:34.575
who gave me the worst review of my life,

01:19:34.608 --> 01:19:36.109
and there he was a minute ago,

01:19:36.143 --> 01:19:39.146
faking his admiration
with the best of them.

01:19:39.179 --> 01:19:41.515
But enough. Enough.

01:19:42.516 --> 01:19:46.554
If revenge is a dish best served cold,

01:19:46.587 --> 01:19:48.756
I've lost my appetite.

01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:58.365
It seems to me now

01:19:59.399 --> 01:20:01.434
that I have been living a lie.

01:20:03.136 --> 01:20:05.472
Staying out of the public view,

01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:08.776
hiding my condition.

01:20:09.710 --> 01:20:13.180
But then, look around you.

01:20:13.213 --> 01:20:17.084
How many of us here
deny the human condition,

01:20:17.117 --> 01:20:19.386
in one form or another?

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.622
We get old.

01:20:22.455 --> 01:20:24.658
That's the truth.

01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:28.161
And how can you tell true stories about
the human condition if you deny it,

01:20:28.195 --> 01:20:30.631
or choose only the good bits?

01:20:30.664 --> 01:20:34.835
Youth and beauty, passion and sex.

01:20:34.868 --> 01:20:39.773
We all come to this, you know,
if we're very lucky.

01:20:39.807 --> 01:20:43.276
There's no truth in cosmetic
enhancement, you know,

01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:45.412
no candor in collagen.

01:20:45.445 --> 01:20:47.347
Besides, which face
would you have lifted?

01:20:49.182 --> 01:20:52.219
What a ship of plastic fools.

01:20:52.252 --> 01:20:56.123
Incontinent, botoxed, nipped,

01:20:56.156 --> 01:20:59.660
tucked, liposucked,
studded with diamonds,

01:20:59.693 --> 01:21:01.695
sailing into the sunset.

01:21:05.766 --> 01:21:09.837
"Cowards die many times
before their deaths.

01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:13.874
"The valiant never
taste of death but once.

01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:20.080
"Of all the wonders
that I yet have heard,

01:21:20.113 --> 01:21:25.586
"It seems to me most strange
that men should fear,

01:21:25.619 --> 01:21:29.790
"Seeing that death, a necessary end,

01:21:30.524 --> 01:21:31.792
"Will come

01:21:33.226 --> 01:21:34.494
"when it will come."

01:21:40.501 --> 01:21:43.971
Oh, come on.
It's not my funeral. Not yet.

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:47.675
Although from all the bollocks
you heard this evening,

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:50.243
you could be excused
for thinking it was.

01:21:56.717 --> 01:21:58.385
But there's something else, though.

01:21:59.820 --> 01:22:05.158
Something I've wanted to do all my life.

01:22:13.300 --> 01:22:14.835
"To be...

01:22:19.206 --> 01:22:20.908
"To be...

01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:38.926
"To be..."

01:22:41.094 --> 01:22:42.963
"Or not to be."

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:50.470
"To be..."
"Or not to be."

01:22:50.504 --> 01:22:55.208
And that really is the question.

01:22:56.009 --> 01:22:59.012
And the answer is,

01:23:00.113 --> 01:23:03.483
to unashamedly,

01:23:04.852 --> 01:23:08.822
unrepentantly, aggressively,

01:23:08.856 --> 01:23:14.828
joyously, bloody well... be!

01:23:14.862 --> 01:23:16.496
Thank you, good night.
