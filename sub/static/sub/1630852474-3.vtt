00:02.000 --> 00:04.240
Someone will achieve this.
And it won't be you.

00:04.240 --> 00:06.800
It will, actually.
You have yourself a wager, sir.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.680
You really think you can cross
the entire globe in just 80 days?

00:09.680 --> 00:11.760
Certainly, my dear, or die trying.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.440
He is a fraud, Miss Fix.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.640
Look, I've never done
anything like this before.

00:15.640 --> 00:18.000
TRAIN WHISTLE

00:15.640 --> 00:18.000
I nearly got us all killed.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.000
But you didn't.
You saved a boy's life.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.600
INDISTINCT

00:21.600 --> 00:23.480
Wait until my father
reads about this.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.840
I'm sick of being the famous
Mr Fortescue's daughter.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.600
I'm going to be a proper writer.
You can be a proper writer here!

00:28.600 --> 00:30.880
No, I can't. You proved that today.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.560
HE SHOUTS

00:32.560 --> 00:35.240
I know you're grieving for your
brother, and I'm sorry, but I think

00:35.240 --> 00:37.920
you're the sort of man who runs away
when things get difficult.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.200
There's not a hope in hell of making
it around the world in 80 days.

00:42.360 --> 00:44.440
You owe the bank Â£15,000.

00:44.440 --> 00:45.880
Bankrupt me.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.280
From a Mr Bellamy, sir, in London.

01:08.960 --> 01:11.680
We will be arriving at the Suez
Canal inside the hour, sir.

01:11.680 --> 01:14.120
Ah, how completely splendid.
Thank you. You're welcome.

01:14.120 --> 01:16.240
Mere months ago we would have had
to have endured

01:16.240 --> 01:18.280
the South Atlantic
and southern Indian oceans.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.160
I know, I wrote the article.Now we
simply sail down the Suez Canal,

01:21.160 --> 01:24.760
meet our ship at Aden, straight
across the Indian Ocean to Bombay.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.760
Astonishing, really. I know, I wrote
the article.Yes.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.760
Yes, you did.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.920
An adventurer and his chronicler.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.760
A team.A team, yes.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.920
I have a very, very good feeling
about this. The sun on our backs,

01:39.920 --> 01:43.000
technology on our side,
India waiting for us.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.520
What do you think, Passepartout?
Are we going to make it?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.480
HE GRUNTS

01:48.480 --> 01:51.120
Good man. Nothing can stop us now.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.480
Pirates? Pirates in the
19th century?

01:56.480 --> 01:59.840
These are not men with wooden legs
and pigeons on their shoulders.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.040
Parrots, Passepartout.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.960
I talked to the First Mate. Banu
Marwan marauders have been targeting

02:04.960 --> 02:07.800
shipping and kidnapping the
wealthier passengers.Kidnapping?

02:07.800 --> 02:09.680
Quite grisly, actually.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.200
They cut off a new finger every day
until the ransom is paid.

02:12.200 --> 02:13.840
What if it isn't paid?

02:15.160 --> 02:18.160
The company have ordered the captain
to rest up here for a few days until

02:18.160 --> 02:20.440
a British ship of war arrives
to escort us to Aden.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.840
We'll miss our connection
to Bombay. I know!

02:22.840 --> 02:25.960
We'll have to make
alternative arrangements.

02:25.960 --> 02:29.720
What sort of alternative
arrangements? I don't know.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.880
We've only just got here.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.480
I wonder if they'd get

02:35.480 --> 02:37.560
The Daily Telegraph in
a place like this?

03:25.640 --> 03:28.400
INDISTINCT CHATTER

03:31.840 --> 03:33.520
Here it is! It's in!

03:35.240 --> 03:38.120
"Fogg saves president of France,
from our own correspondent,

03:38.120 --> 03:39.920
"Miss Abigail Fix."

03:39.920 --> 03:43.200
My first credited article! My father
actually put my name on it!

03:43.200 --> 03:45.560
"Phileas Fogg, with scant
regard for his own safety,

03:45.560 --> 03:48.440
"threw himself between the president
of France

03:48.440 --> 03:50.640
"and his would-be assassin." Did I?

03:50.640 --> 03:53.200
You appear to have mis-told
my role in the story.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.520
The thing you need to know about my
father is he

03:55.520 --> 03:58.280
won't simply humour me. If he
thought the article wasn't good

03:58.280 --> 04:00.640
enough, he just wouldn't print it.
"Could Phileas Fogg be the next

04:00.640 --> 04:02.720
"great British explorer, following
in the footsteps of

04:02.720 --> 04:07.200
Livingstone, "Speke and Burton?"
Nope.We must get to Aden.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.320
We WILL get to Aden.
This calls for a celebration.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.400
A large, cold beer, please.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.880
Beer? Beer.

04:17.880 --> 04:21.600
Beer, if you please! I don't think
saying it louder is going to help.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.920
We're in Al Hudaydah, in the
Ottoman Empire.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.680
There's no alcohol.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.560
We'll have coffee, thank you.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.000
Need to find out when
the next boat to Aden sails.

04:32.680 --> 04:36.320
Oh, my giddy...aunt!

04:39.440 --> 04:42.520
Do not look now, but there's a woman
over there haggling over a camel,

04:42.520 --> 04:44.520
and I think it's Jane Digby.

04:50.480 --> 04:53.320
Good Lord, I do believe you're
right. Who is she?

04:53.320 --> 04:57.440
Only the most immoral and despised
Englishwoman in the world.

04:57.440 --> 04:59.320
What has she done wrong?

04:59.320 --> 05:02.600
Where do I begin? She's been married
to Lord Ellenborough,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.600
the Governor General of India.
She left him and had open affairs

05:05.600 --> 05:07.520
with Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg

05:07.520 --> 05:09.760
and Ludwig I of Bavaria.

05:09.760 --> 05:12.560
Yeah, but what has she done wrong?
Abandoned her children.

05:12.560 --> 05:15.240
Don't gossip, Miss Fix,
it's unbecoming.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.760
Right, where are we? She married
another Baron in Munich,

05:17.760 --> 05:20.160
then had an affair
with King Otto of Greece,

05:20.160 --> 05:22.480
followed by a shameless fling
with a hero of the

05:22.480 --> 05:25.800
Greek Revolution, General
Christodoulos Hatzipetros.

05:25.800 --> 05:29.080
She must be exhausted. Finally, and
this is the really scandalous bit,

05:29.080 --> 05:31.960
she ran off and married
an Arab camel driver.

05:31.960 --> 05:34.000
That must be him.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.840
Quite handsome,
I suppose, as camel drivers go.

05:36.840 --> 05:40.200
It's ridiculous. The next boat for
Aden doesn't sail for three days!

05:40.200 --> 05:42.720
My father knew her a little bit.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.480
Said her morals were even lower than
her intelligence.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.320
Maybe I should introduce myself.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.720
You will do no such thing.

05:48.720 --> 05:51.600
We may be far from home,
but we're not without standards.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.200
Speak for yourself, Monsieur.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.800
She's coming this way. Ignore her.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.880
Good luck.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.680
This isn't France - you're going to
need it.

06:22.840 --> 06:26.400
Try not to tuck it in too tightly at
the bottom.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.000
I hate having my toes bent back by a
rigid sheet.

06:31.400 --> 06:32.560
KNOCKING

06:34.800 --> 06:36.120
Assalaamu Alaikum.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.520
Forgive me, I hear you speaking.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.440
It is important you go to Aden?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.760
Yes, terribly important.

06:43.760 --> 06:44.960
There is a way...

06:44.960 --> 06:46.400
..across the Empty Quarter.

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
For a small cost, I take you.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.800
Through the desert?

06:50.800 --> 06:53.880
Why is it called the Empty Quarter?

06:54.960 --> 06:56.480
Because it is empty.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.880
Why is it empty?

06:58.880 --> 07:01.280
Because everyone who goes there
dies.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.160
It is a most generous offer,
malheureusement...

07:05.160 --> 07:08.040
I will be with you, sirs. There is
no need to be afraid.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.080
Passepartout.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.200
How long will it take?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.120
Two days.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.600
Two days would put us back on
schedule.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.120
Non, Monsieur, you cannot even
consider this.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.880
And how much is a small cost?

07:21.880 --> 07:23.960
Ten British pounds.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.000
Ten?

07:27.360 --> 07:28.440
Please, Monsieur.

07:31.880 --> 07:35.040
When we get to Aden, I will pay the
money.

07:35.040 --> 07:37.040
Half now for supplies.No, no, no.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.400
No, half now and we never see you
again.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.040
I know how you chaps do business.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.640
As you wish, effendi.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.840
So, when do we leave?

07:48.840 --> 07:51.000
One hour before dawn.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.120
Very good.

07:53.520 --> 07:54.560
Very good.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.960
We know nothing about the desert,
we know nothing about this man.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.720
This way, we're back on track for
India.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.320
I thought you promised your
friend...

08:17.320 --> 08:19.680
..that you would look after his
daughter.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.680
The Empty Quarter, really?

08:21.680 --> 08:23.720
Everyone who goes there dies.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.040
Yes.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.520
You're absolutely right.
What was I thinking?

08:29.520 --> 08:31.360
That's no place for a woman.

08:31.360 --> 08:35.360
I'll go after him, tell him we
no longer need his help.No!

08:35.360 --> 08:38.160
Miss Fix must remain here.

08:38.160 --> 08:39.800
What do you mean?

08:39.800 --> 08:42.920
Fortescue would never forgive me if
I knowingly endangered her life.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.160
Monsieur, I didn't mean that she had
to stay here.

08:45.160 --> 08:48.120
No, no, no, no more... Nothing else
to say on the subject.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.760
If she goes home to her father
without this story...

08:50.760 --> 08:53.600
Leaders must make difficult
decisions, I've made mine.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.080
She will be devastated.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.680
Get some sleep, while you can.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.160
KNOCKING

09:29.920 --> 09:31.680
Oh, excuse me, Miss Fix.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.280
Please, come in.

09:37.120 --> 09:40.320
I know you think I'm silly,
going on about this article,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.280
but let me explain.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.360
You don't have to explain anything
to me.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.440
When my mother died, my father
brought me up on his own.

09:49.440 --> 09:52.280
Sometimes, it was sad just being
the two of us,

09:52.280 --> 09:55.360
both of us missing my mother...

09:55.360 --> 09:57.200
..but at other times...

09:58.840 --> 10:01.240
..we'd sit around this enormous map
of the world

10:01.240 --> 10:03.880
and he'd point out the places he'd
been to,

10:03.880 --> 10:07.240
the wars he'd reported on and lived
through.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.560
Sometimes, of course, he had to go
away and work but...

10:10.560 --> 10:13.880
..he always hurried back to me and
always had a new story to tell.

10:16.080 --> 10:19.720
I want to repay him by telling this
story.

10:35.040 --> 10:36.840
I'm French...

10:36.840 --> 10:38.960
..that's how we say goodnight in
France.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.800
I say.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.800
CAMEL GRUNTS

11:01.320 --> 11:02.800
Tremendous.

11:15.120 --> 11:16.880
I have no choice.

11:16.880 --> 11:18.520
It's too dangerous for her.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.000
CAMEL GRUNTS

11:52.440 --> 11:53.920
KNOCKING

11:53.920 --> 11:55.240
Mr Fogg?

12:32.840 --> 12:34.800
Should we be careful with our water?

12:34.800 --> 12:36.320
There is an oasis ahead.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.560
My people camp there.
Plenty of water.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.920
Listen to me. Please, listen!

12:45.920 --> 12:47.520
I need a guide.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.160
Please!

12:49.160 --> 12:50.960
I need a guide.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.280
Aden.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.840
Aden, I need someone to take me to
Aden.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.080
I can pay.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.760
THEY SHOUT OVER EACH OTHER

13:21.400 --> 13:22.600
MAN SHOUTS

13:27.640 --> 13:29.320
Are you hurt?

13:34.880 --> 13:36.480
Where are your friends?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.800
There's been a terrible mistake.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.520
They've left me behind in error and
I need to find them.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.760
They left you behind in error?

13:46.760 --> 13:49.440
I'm trying to get one of these men
to take me to Aden,

13:49.440 --> 13:51.080
so I can meet up with them.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.880
These men?

13:52.880 --> 13:56.240
Didn't your mother teach you never
to talk to strange men?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.560
Didn't yours?

14:03.560 --> 14:06.360
Please, Lady Ellenborough...

14:06.360 --> 14:09.080
..will you help me get to Aden?

14:09.080 --> 14:10.720
I have money.

14:16.560 --> 14:18.760
CHILDREN LAUGH

14:20.920 --> 14:22.440
Go home.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.840
No.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.080
Never!

14:36.160 --> 14:37.560
I saw that.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.320
HE GROANS

15:11.960 --> 15:14.520
Call of nature, I'm afraid. It can't
be ignored.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.920
CAMEL GRUNTS

15:19.600 --> 15:21.560
How absolutely fascinating.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.600
Huh!

15:29.600 --> 15:31.760
That's called petroleum...

15:31.760 --> 15:33.800
..from the Latin "petra", meaning
rock.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.760
Sometimes, it seeps up to the
surface. What are you doing?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.400
The same as you, I imagine.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.960
Well, move along a bit. Why?

15:40.960 --> 15:43.120
Because...

15:43.120 --> 15:45.920
..because I can't go when there's
another chap in the vicinity.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.960
I thought you went to
boarding school.Please.

15:48.960 --> 15:50.920
HE SIGHS

15:50.920 --> 15:52.160
A bit more.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
Oh, too late, Monsieur.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.160
HE URINATES

15:54.160 --> 15:55.880
HE SIGHS

16:06.680 --> 16:10.360
Close your eyes and think of the
River Thames.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.840
Millions and millions of gallons
of water

16:13.840 --> 16:18.280
swirling and flooding and surging
towards the sea,

16:18.280 --> 16:21.960
as heavy rain falls from the great
London sky...

16:21.960 --> 16:23.320
Monsieur Fogg!

16:23.320 --> 16:25.840
Well, I definitely can't go if you
insist on talking to me.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.920
If you're going to be a
gentleman's gentleman,

16:27.920 --> 16:30.680
you need to understand the
peccadilloes of said...

16:30.680 --> 16:32.360
Oh, no!

16:32.360 --> 16:33.760
No!

16:46.040 --> 16:48.400
Oh, my jacket!

16:50.560 --> 16:52.480
My watch.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.240
He's stolen my father's watch.

16:55.480 --> 16:59.240
Well, at least he didn't get our
money.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.960
What shop shall we go to first?

17:17.080 --> 17:18.400
Mr Bellamy... Mm-hm?

17:18.400 --> 17:22.120
..we were just tidying up the
gentlemen's bar bills and we...

17:22.120 --> 17:25.440
..we noticed that your own bill has
not been paid since the summer.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.120
The summer? What nonsense.

17:29.120 --> 17:30.560
Apparently so, sir.

17:34.000 --> 17:36.600
I seem to have left my wallet at
home, Roberts,

17:36.600 --> 17:38.080
I'll sort you out in the morning.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.360
The thing is, sir, I do believe you
said that the last time.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.760
What are you implying, man?

17:43.840 --> 17:45.600
He's only doing his job, old chap.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.480
No need for a scene.

17:47.480 --> 17:49.320
Let me take care of it.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.840
Oh, no, I couldn't possibly.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.240
I'll reimburse you tomorrow.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.320
Of course. Don't mention it.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.360
Why are you doing all this?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.240
Risking your life for a stupid
wager.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.000
How much money can one man want?

18:20.920 --> 18:22.800
It's not about money. Pride?

18:22.800 --> 18:24.800
Who cares what those men think about
you.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.520
This is neither the time nor the
place for this discussion.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.560
Where are we going?

18:42.560 --> 18:44.160
To the oasis.

18:44.160 --> 18:46.160
How do you know there is an oasis?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.840
The man said there was.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.160
The crazy man who left us out here
to die?

18:50.160 --> 18:52.080
Do you have a better idea?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.000
Yes, we go back.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.080
We'll never make it back without
water.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.520
This is our only chance.

19:01.640 --> 19:06.280
Well, risk your life, be my guest,
but stop risking mine.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.760
You must have faith, Passepartout.

19:09.760 --> 19:11.680
I will get us through this.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.160
What do you miss about England,
Lady Ellenborough?

19:30.160 --> 19:31.560
Nothing.

19:31.560 --> 19:33.960
Don't call me Lady Ellenborough.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.440
What would you like me to call you?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.200
You must miss something.

19:42.520 --> 19:45.120
The cavalry jingling down
Horse Guards Parade?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.800
Snow falling on Hampstead Heath?

19:47.800 --> 19:49.880
Children skating on Hyde Park?

19:51.200 --> 19:53.520
You have children in London,
I believe.

19:53.520 --> 19:55.000
Do you get to see much of them?

19:55.000 --> 19:56.280
Must be difficult.

19:56.280 --> 19:58.600
I'm sorry, I was only asking!

19:58.600 --> 19:59.720
SHE SCREAMS

19:59.720 --> 20:01.520
HORSE NEIGHS

20:06.400 --> 20:08.040
Thank you.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.400
It's a good camel.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.320
Tracks of three camels...

20:15.320 --> 20:16.960
..going back to Al Hudaydah.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.040
They've turned around.

20:19.040 --> 20:22.000
Perhaps your friends aren't
quite so stupid after all.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.360
Only one of the camels is carrying
a man.

20:24.360 --> 20:25.960
The other tracks are lighter.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.360
What are you saying?

20:27.360 --> 20:30.280
Three people went out,
only one is returning.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.920
We go back now.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.120
In this heat,
without transportation,

20:34.120 --> 20:35.520
they're as good as dead.

21:11.600 --> 21:13.120
HE BLOWS VIGOROUSLY

21:19.680 --> 21:21.240
Urgh!

21:22.600 --> 21:24.360
HE MUTTERS

21:37.160 --> 21:39.720
Never thought I'd say this - I
rather miss Miss Fix.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.440
Absolutely did the right thing.

21:43.440 --> 21:45.400
This is no place for a woman.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.480
It's not a lot of fun for a man.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.840
Mm.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.000
She did have a certain...joie de
vivre.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.480
I know.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.800
Certainly one of life's enthusiasts.

21:59.800 --> 22:01.720
A very pleasant laugh.

22:01.720 --> 22:03.280
Courage.Indeed.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.640
Intelligence.

22:04.640 --> 22:05.880
Determination.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.160
Resilience.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.440
Pretty.

22:08.440 --> 22:09.640
Steady on!

22:15.840 --> 22:17.360
Well, at least she's safe.

22:19.920 --> 22:22.920
Sailing home to London and her
father's embrace...

22:22.920 --> 22:24.320
..where she should be.

22:33.800 --> 22:35.200
CHATTER AND LAUGHTER

23:03.000 --> 23:04.760
Monsieur, get up.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.560
I said, get up!

23:08.560 --> 23:10.400
Just a little rest.

23:10.400 --> 23:12.000
If you stop here, you will die.

23:21.800 --> 23:23.520
You are a hero...

23:24.720 --> 23:26.600
..remember?

23:28.480 --> 23:30.080
That's just words.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.480
Miss Fix's stupid words.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.320
I said, get up, man!

23:42.800 --> 23:45.920
I'm sorry, Passepartout, for all of
this.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.120
Whatever happens, I want you to
know...

23:50.120 --> 23:52.480
..you're the best valet I've ever
had.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.160
Really?

23:54.160 --> 23:56.920
You know, I'm not actually a valet.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.440
You're not?

23:59.440 --> 24:00.840
What are you, then?

24:00.840 --> 24:02.440
Anything you want me to be.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.840
HE GROANS

24:07.560 --> 24:09.720
Look, look.

24:13.360 --> 24:15.040
Is that...

24:15.040 --> 24:16.200
A man?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.600
..a man?

24:22.480 --> 24:24.040
A lot of men.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.520
They are coming towards us!

24:25.520 --> 24:26.960
Over here!

24:26.960 --> 24:28.280
Hey!

24:28.280 --> 24:31.000
Hey!Over here!

24:31.000 --> 24:32.520
Over here!

24:32.520 --> 24:34.240
We're saved!

24:34.240 --> 24:36.240
We're saved!

24:36.240 --> 24:38.080
THEY LAUGH HYSTERICALLY

24:38.080 --> 24:40.320
We're saved!

24:42.200 --> 24:43.920
That's not people.

24:43.920 --> 24:45.440
What? Of course it is.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.160
Our brains wanted it to be people.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.000
What the hell is it, then?

24:51.280 --> 24:52.320
That's...

24:55.480 --> 24:57.240
..that's a sandstorm.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.360
Use this...

25:15.280 --> 25:16.760
..to breathe.

25:19.240 --> 25:21.280
Hold my hand.

25:24.320 --> 25:25.960
We must try and stay together.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.120
Hold on to me!

25:50.120 --> 25:51.600
Don't let go!

25:58.480 --> 26:00.040
Argh!

26:03.920 --> 26:05.560
Passepartout!

26:08.680 --> 26:10.640
Passepartout!

26:14.080 --> 26:16.400
Passepartout!

26:57.160 --> 26:59.920
HORSE NEIGHS

27:30.600 --> 27:32.400
WHISPERS: Passepartout.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.360
Passepartout, Passepartout.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.880
Passepartout!

27:43.880 --> 27:45.480
You made it!

27:45.480 --> 27:47.000
I'm so pleased.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.240
I'm so...

27:48.240 --> 27:51.000
Oh, oh!

27:51.000 --> 27:52.400
Well done.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.160
Well done.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.200
Drink it slowly, Monsieur.

28:00.200 --> 28:02.200
HE GROANS

28:02.200 --> 28:04.640
Wait, wait, wait.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.880
Slowly.

28:05.880 --> 28:07.280
HE GROANS

28:09.720 --> 28:12.200
Better than champagne.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.680
HE GASPS

28:15.360 --> 28:16.840
Oh!

28:18.320 --> 28:21.400
You, sir, are a gracious...

28:21.400 --> 28:24.120
..and noble hero.

28:24.120 --> 28:26.320
A man amongst men.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.440
And you, sir, are an imbecile.

28:29.440 --> 28:31.160
PASSEPARTOUT CHUCKLES

28:32.640 --> 28:34.160
You saved my life.

28:34.160 --> 28:35.880
I would have left you there.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.440
SHE saved your life.

28:39.840 --> 28:41.360
Hello, Mr Fogg.

28:43.120 --> 28:45.440
Oh, Miss Fix...

28:58.440 --> 28:59.800
Bernard, your shot.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.400
Telegram for you, Mr Fortescue.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.520
Oh, thank you.

29:11.560 --> 29:12.880
It's from Abigail.

29:12.880 --> 29:14.480
They've left Al Hudaydah

29:14.480 --> 29:17.440
and are heading across the desert
to Aden.

29:18.680 --> 29:22.080
What is that fool, Fogg, doing,
taking Abigail into the desert?

29:25.080 --> 29:26.760
What is it?

29:26.760 --> 29:28.520
She has a travelling companion...

29:30.200 --> 29:32.400
..Jane Digby.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.880
The Bedouin bed-hopper.

29:34.880 --> 29:37.040
I'm surprised she has the audacity
to leave the tent,

29:37.040 --> 29:39.120
after the way that you exposed her
to the world.

29:49.560 --> 29:52.920
To leave me behind like I was a
piece of unwanted luggage!

29:52.920 --> 29:56.080
What else was I to do? I gave your
father my word I'd look after you.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.840
Reckless, Miss Fix. You're reckless.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.680
And you, Mr Fogg, are pathetic

29:59.680 --> 30:02.480
and only alive because I persuaded
these people to look for you.

30:02.480 --> 30:03.800
Think about that.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.160
Enough with the shouting.

30:05.160 --> 30:07.440
Yesterday, you were telling each
other what a fine team we are.

30:07.440 --> 30:09.280
And don't think I've forgotten about
you,

30:09.280 --> 30:12.560
Monsieur "That's how we say
goodnight in France" Passepartout!

30:15.560 --> 30:18.400
Sneaking off in the middle of the
night with not so much as a goodbye

30:18.400 --> 30:21.240
is not looking after me,
it is humiliating me!

30:21.240 --> 30:22.680
Look at us, we nearly died!

30:22.680 --> 30:24.400
Because you trusted a complete
crook.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.720
If you'd had the courtesy and sense
to discuss...

30:26.720 --> 30:29.680
As Passepartout pointed out,
this is no place for a woman.

30:31.360 --> 30:33.520
Well, thank you very much.

30:33.520 --> 30:36.400
When we get to Aden, I'm sending you
home whether you like it or not.

30:36.400 --> 30:38.040
You most certainly are not!

30:38.040 --> 30:39.920
Nobody's going to Aden.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.520
When the sun goes down, we'll take
you back to Al Hudaydah.

30:42.520 --> 30:45.360
Oh, no, no, no. No, I have a boat to
catch. So do I.

30:45.360 --> 30:46.840
Yes, I've looked at it on a map,

30:46.840 --> 30:48.760
just a little piece of desert to
cross.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.240
That little piece of desert is
inhabited by the Subayhi tribe.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.920
Even if we took you,
you'd never make it...

30:54.920 --> 30:57.080
..and we're not taking you.

30:57.080 --> 31:00.280
My father will pay you handsomely
if you take me to Aden.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.880
You can leave Mr Fogg to the
vultures for all I care.

31:02.880 --> 31:05.120
How dare you! There is no trip
without me.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.320
Nonsense.

31:06.320 --> 31:09.120
I will take up the 80-day challenge
on behalf of my readers.

31:09.120 --> 31:11.000
I'm beginning to think you're quite
mad.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.880
Who do you think my father would
print, me or you?

31:12.880 --> 31:14.080
As a hatter.

31:14.080 --> 31:15.880
In fact, we could have a race,
me against you.

31:15.880 --> 31:18.200
I think we both know who'd win that.
If you want my opinion...

31:18.200 --> 31:20.160
Which we do not! Just shut up,
Passepartout!

31:22.200 --> 31:23.880
What do you say, Lady Ellenborough?

31:23.880 --> 31:27.560
Name your price. Who is this
precious father of yours?

31:27.560 --> 31:30.720
Bernard Fortescue, editor of the
Daily Telegraph.

31:32.240 --> 31:33.880
Fix was my mother's maiden name.

31:35.440 --> 31:38.520
Your father lived in Damascus,
did you know that?

31:38.520 --> 31:41.080
Yes, of course. He talked of it
often.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.760
It's where he made his reputation as
a journalist.

31:43.760 --> 31:46.360
A reputation forged in the bars
and brothels...

31:46.360 --> 31:47.960
..never the battlefields.

31:49.080 --> 31:51.880
He'd steal braver
journalists' reports...

31:51.880 --> 31:54.160
..embellish them and send them to
London.

31:54.160 --> 31:55.400
That is not true!

31:55.400 --> 31:56.880
I absolutely refuse to believe that.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.480
I've led an unconventional life,
as you know.Yes.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.320
It has attracted a lot of criticism,

32:02.320 --> 32:05.880
some of it justified, most of it
horrid and untrue.

32:06.920 --> 32:11.520
But I have never met a more
disgraceful man than your father.

32:11.520 --> 32:12.960
How dare you!

32:14.440 --> 32:16.360
He asked me to run away with him.

32:16.360 --> 32:19.720
Did he tell you that,
your beloved father?

32:19.720 --> 32:21.400
The whore and the charlatan.

32:21.400 --> 32:22.480
You're a liar!

32:47.360 --> 32:50.640
The more she resisted, the more
obsessed with her he became.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.600
And when she finally refused him,

32:52.600 --> 32:55.440
he wrote a vile piece in his London
newspaper.

32:55.440 --> 32:58.640
The piece that turned her own
children against her.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.160
Jane Digby was a disgrace to her
country.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.640
A disgrace to her sex.

33:03.640 --> 33:05.200
Who's to say she's not?

33:05.200 --> 33:08.280
He wrote that she had run off with
a camel driver.

33:08.280 --> 33:13.560
My name is Sheik Medjuel el Mezrab
from the great tribe of Anizzah.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.680
I have never driven camels

33:15.680 --> 33:17.520
and why would it matter if I had?

33:18.720 --> 33:20.640
Whatever you think of me,

33:20.640 --> 33:23.640
I will be with that woman until
the day that death parts us.

33:24.880 --> 33:28.040
When the sun goes down,
we leave for Al Hudaydah. Be ready.

33:32.960 --> 33:34.840
Then the wager is lost.

33:34.840 --> 33:36.080
Damn the wager.

34:18.120 --> 34:21.560
Do you believe the things they said
about him?

34:21.560 --> 34:23.160
Abigail... The truth.

34:27.240 --> 34:28.800
HE SIGHS

34:28.800 --> 34:30.240
I...

34:30.240 --> 34:33.080
A week ago, I'd have said,
"No, absolute rot."

34:34.960 --> 34:38.000
But that was when the world was
black and white

34:38.000 --> 34:41.360
and England were 270 for 3 at tea
and every question had its answer.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.400
And now?

34:45.520 --> 34:48.640
I stopped a bullet meant for the
President of France.

34:50.280 --> 34:52.840
I looked down on Paris from a
balloon.

34:54.720 --> 34:58.840
Manoeuvred a steam train over an
Italian ravine.

34:58.840 --> 35:02.200
Today, my life is saved by an
Arab...

35:02.200 --> 35:03.840
..and a disgraced Englishwoman.

35:07.280 --> 35:08.480
And now...

35:10.280 --> 35:12.800
..I discover that my oldest and
dearest friend

35:12.800 --> 35:14.480
may not be a hero after all.

35:15.880 --> 35:17.680
Just a man...

35:17.680 --> 35:19.280
..who made some mistakes.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.880
I'm sorry you won't win your bet.

35:27.400 --> 35:30.680
I apologise for underestimating you,
Abigail.

35:32.600 --> 35:35.040
I hope you can find it in your heart
to forgive me.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.320
And not just me.

35:41.560 --> 35:44.400
His job was to write the truth...

35:44.400 --> 35:46.240
..and he chose to write lies.

35:47.920 --> 35:49.600
There can be no forgiveness.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.200
What will you do now?

36:15.720 --> 36:18.120
I'll go back to London,

36:18.120 --> 36:19.960
have a furious row with my father

36:19.960 --> 36:22.840
and then go back to reporting on
dogs and flowers.

36:22.840 --> 36:24.240
Sounds dull.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.560
It's what I was meant to do.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.040
I'm a fool for thinking
anything different.

36:31.440 --> 36:35.200
I was 18 years old when I was
married to Lord Ellenborough.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.560
He was twice my age,
barely talked to me,

36:37.560 --> 36:40.240
preferred the company of
his horses and mistresses.

36:41.520 --> 36:45.320
I cried myself to sleep every night.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.880
And I asked my mother
what I could do.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.280
"Nothing," she said.

36:52.280 --> 36:56.280
"He is your husband and you must be
grateful."

36:56.280 --> 36:58.360
I was not grateful.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.920
I swore I would live my life,
not anybody else's.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.680
PASSEPARTOUT: Come on, let's go.

37:10.840 --> 37:12.160
Let's go!

37:14.720 --> 37:16.080
Come on!

37:18.040 --> 37:20.120
Is this journey important to you?

37:23.240 --> 37:24.680
It was.

37:25.800 --> 37:28.080
Now it means nothing.

37:28.080 --> 37:30.960
Perhaps you were undertaking it for
the wrong person.

37:35.400 --> 37:37.160
It's your choice, Miss Fix.

37:37.160 --> 37:40.360
I can take you back to
Al Hudaydah...

37:40.360 --> 37:43.520
..or I can take you across
the Empty Quarter to Aden.

38:15.240 --> 38:19.240
Just so you know, it wasn't my idea
to leave you behind.

38:19.240 --> 38:23.160
Oh, I'm sure you argued my case
passionately all through the night.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.520
I'm a mere valet,
nobody listens to me.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.480
You're a man of straw, Passepartout.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.120
You care only about yourself.

38:34.040 --> 38:37.000
If any of you want to survive the
night...

38:37.000 --> 38:39.120
..you stay close together...

38:39.120 --> 38:40.520
..and you stay quiet.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.000
From here, it's very dangerous.

38:53.000 --> 38:54.400
Keep quiet, keep close.

38:58.960 --> 39:01.520
I don't want it. Take it.

39:01.520 --> 39:04.400
I'm not killing anybody for a rich
man's wager.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.000
I'm not losing my wife because you
don't believe in anything.

39:07.000 --> 39:08.040
Take it.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.440
HORSE NEIGHS

39:31.760 --> 39:33.160
What is it?

39:53.720 --> 39:55.000
HORSE NEIGHS

39:56.320 --> 39:57.800
Dismount, quickly.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.920
Maybe they just want the camels.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.240
No, they want us.

40:20.400 --> 40:22.480
Be ready. Be ready for what?

40:22.480 --> 40:23.960
I can't see a thing!

40:40.000 --> 40:42.600
Passepartout,
do you remember when we...

40:42.600 --> 40:43.920
Move!

40:43.920 --> 40:45.040
SHOUTING

40:49.520 --> 40:51.000
Run!

40:52.160 --> 40:53.760
SHOUTING

40:59.840 --> 41:01.160
There!

41:01.160 --> 41:02.360
Be careful, Passepartout.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.480
They're trying to get us
to use up our ammunition.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.800
How can we fight them if we can't
even see them?

41:12.440 --> 41:14.240
Argh, Passepartout!

41:14.240 --> 41:15.640
Passepartout!

41:18.400 --> 41:19.800
Argh!

41:25.600 --> 41:28.120
JANE: Run, Miss Fix!

41:34.760 --> 41:36.400
I'm nearly out.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.000
As am I.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.080
Here they come again.

42:14.960 --> 42:16.640
They've gone for reinforcements.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.040
We go now or we die.

42:21.040 --> 42:22.640
Passepartout!

42:47.840 --> 42:50.160
There she is, my friends...

42:50.160 --> 42:51.440
..Aden.

43:08.200 --> 43:10.960
Let's go on ahead
and buy our tickets.

43:10.960 --> 43:14.360
I hope it's not a Muslim ship.
I simply must have a beer.

43:14.360 --> 43:16.200
Have them draw a bath for me
in my cabin.

43:16.200 --> 43:17.480
I need a jolly good scrub.

43:17.480 --> 43:21.360
That petroleum, it burned
like a Roman candle, didn't it?

43:21.360 --> 43:24.760
This new industrial world is
going to need some powering,

43:24.760 --> 43:27.560
I wonder if we could actually
utilise that stuff to...

43:27.560 --> 43:29.160
I killed a man, monsieur.

43:31.440 --> 43:34.480
I know you did, yeah.
Nasty business.

43:35.640 --> 43:36.880
Yes.

43:39.200 --> 43:43.560
I understand now that my attempt to
circumnavigate the world in 80 days

43:43.560 --> 43:47.320
is not going to be without some
extremely serious obstacles.

43:47.320 --> 43:51.200
That is still all you care about?
Going around the world in 80 days?

43:51.200 --> 43:53.320
I made a wager... A bet?

43:53.320 --> 43:55.280
That is the only
reason you are here?

43:57.520 --> 43:59.880
You're upset about killing a man,
I understand that.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.440
I'd be disappointed in you
if you weren't.

44:02.440 --> 44:06.560
But, you know, we have to
put that behind us now,

44:06.560 --> 44:08.440
look to the future, hm?

44:08.440 --> 44:09.760
To India.

44:13.760 --> 44:15.720
I'll go and secure our cabins.

44:15.720 --> 44:18.280
Meet you and Miss Fix
back at the market. Yes?

44:26.960 --> 44:31.360
Your friends really are
extremely interested in themselves,

44:31.360 --> 44:33.320
aren't they, Passepartout?

44:34.680 --> 44:36.320
Who are you?

44:38.800 --> 44:40.000
Drink?

44:41.640 --> 44:45.200
ABIGAIL: For the offices
of The Daily Telegraph,

44:45.200 --> 44:48.280
Fleet Street, London.

44:48.280 --> 44:52.280
Safely in Aden, stop.

44:52.280 --> 44:54.040
This is where we leave you.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.840
On behalf of my father,
I would like to apologise

44:56.840 --> 44:59.280
for his behaviour towards
you and your husband.

44:59.280 --> 45:01.520
One day, God willing,
I will tell him to his face

45:01.520 --> 45:03.600
of the great hurt
he has done to you.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.560
It's not important to me any more.

45:07.040 --> 45:10.320
But there is one thing you
could do for me. Anything.

45:10.320 --> 45:13.200
When you get back to London,

45:13.200 --> 45:14.840
tell my children...

45:16.680 --> 45:18.280
I'll tell them.

45:20.880 --> 45:23.880
Jane Digby, a marvel...

45:25.560 --> 45:27.160
..stop.

45:36.240 --> 45:39.960
Every decision I made,
I made for myself.

45:43.680 --> 45:46.160
The joy is mine.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.720
The pain is mine.

45:49.760 --> 45:51.840
Bernard Fortescue...

45:57.240 --> 45:59.120
..a liar...

46:01.560 --> 46:02.880
..stop.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.440
I've decided I'm going to let you
continue with me around the world.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.560
Is that acceptable?

46:20.560 --> 46:22.240
Most acceptable, yes.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.120
Right, let's board our ship.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.800
I have a friend who is very keen

46:29.800 --> 46:32.840
that our Mr Fogg doesn't make it
back to London on Christmas Eve.

46:35.480 --> 46:38.160
All you need to do is make sure
he's delayed in India

46:38.160 --> 46:40.960
and he misses his sailing
to Hong Kong.

46:45.000 --> 46:49.600
Yeah, the rich get all the money
and the poor get all the work, huh?

46:54.400 --> 46:56.280
Perhaps not always.

47:02.560 --> 47:04.840
I don't betray my friends.

47:04.840 --> 47:07.440
Friends? Is that really
what they are?

47:07.440 --> 47:11.040
Are they not your
master and mistress?

47:11.040 --> 47:14.480
And care only about themselves
and their wager?

47:14.480 --> 47:17.040
See, money...

47:17.040 --> 47:18.560
..is freedom.

47:20.040 --> 47:23.520
One small favour for me
will buy you a lot of freedom.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.520
Cigar?

47:55.720 --> 47:57.520
What do I have to do?
