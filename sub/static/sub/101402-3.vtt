WEBVTT

00:15.000 --> 00:16.000
[engine revving]

00:17.000 --> 00:17.980
[Kim] Mum?

00:18.020 --> 00:19.000
[grunts]

00:20.000 --> 00:21.000
Mum?

00:23.000 --> 00:23.980
[grunts]

00:24.020 --> 00:24.980
[breathing heavily]

00:25.020 --> 00:26.075
We need to go back

00:26.115 --> 00:26.980
right now, Mum.

00:27.020 --> 00:28.018
Darling, you know

00:28.058 --> 00:28.980
I can't hear you

00:29.020 --> 00:29.980
when you mumble like that.

00:30.020 --> 00:31.580
[Kim] I'm in trouble, Mum!

00:32.000 --> 00:32.623
And that's why we're

00:32.663 --> 00:32.980
going home.

00:33.020 --> 00:34.248
I told you, you couldn't

00:34.288 --> 00:34.980
cope out here.

00:35.020 --> 00:36.469
I told you, you weren't

00:36.509 --> 00:36.980
ready...

00:37.020 --> 00:38.160
[Kim] Jimmy's dead!

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
I killed him.

00:44.000 --> 00:44.863
And my fingerprints

00:44.903 --> 00:45.980
are all over that house.

00:46.020 --> 00:47.000
[brakes screech]

00:48.000 --> 00:48.980
[Kim] Jesus!

00:49.020 --> 00:50.257
How many times have I

00:50.297 --> 00:50.980
said to you,

00:51.020 --> 00:52.365
"Gloves and a gun if you want

00:52.405 --> 00:52.980
to have fun."

00:53.020 --> 00:54.018
I mean, it rhymes

00:54.058 --> 00:55.018
for fuck's sake!

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
[exhales]

01:05.000 --> 01:05.508
I don't think she's

01:05.548 --> 01:06.568
coming back, kid.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.080
We should just go.

01:11.000 --> 01:11.856
-Hey, what about Ian?

01:11.896 --> 01:13.516
-It's not our problem, man!

01:14.000 --> 01:15.500
We didn't do any of this.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Let's just go!

01:18.000 --> 01:18.980
But not with that money.

01:19.020 --> 01:21.022
This is our chance to set up

01:21.062 --> 01:22.980
the business properly, bro.

01:23.020 --> 01:24.420
Just me and you, kid.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.000
Like Dad always wanted.

01:29.000 --> 01:29.980
Whoa! [indistinct yelling]

01:30.020 --> 01:31.092
[Nicky] Leave it.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.980
Just give it... just give it!

01:33.020 --> 01:34.036
All right, all right,

01:34.076 --> 01:35.216
just stop a minute?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.735
Just stop rushing around

01:38.775 --> 01:39.980
like a fucking...

01:40.020 --> 01:41.400
bull in a Chinese shop.

01:43.000 --> 01:43.580
You mean,

01:43.620 --> 01:44.980
bull in a china shop.

01:45.020 --> 01:45.980
What's a china shop?

01:46.020 --> 01:47.135
You know, they sell

01:47.175 --> 01:47.980
cups and that.

01:48.020 --> 01:48.785
-What, from China?

01:48.825 --> 01:49.980
-[Nicky] Made out of china.

01:50.020 --> 01:51.206
That's why you can't have

01:51.246 --> 01:51.980
a bull in there,

01:52.020 --> 01:52.980
'cause it'll break everything.

01:53.020 --> 01:55.000
Oh!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.261
Bro, I thought the bull

01:57.301 --> 01:57.980
was panicking

01:58.020 --> 01:58.931
because he was in

01:58.971 --> 02:00.111
a Chinese takeaway.

02:01.000 --> 02:01.896
Well, 'cause they cook

02:01.936 --> 02:03.496
loads of beef, don't they?

02:06.000 --> 02:08.000
[sighs] This is not our money.

02:10.000 --> 02:10.980
We need to put it back

02:11.020 --> 02:12.340
and just wait for Kim.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.451
It's easy for you though,

02:16.491 --> 02:17.031
isn't it?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.380
Mr. Fucking big brains.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.140
What about me, bro?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
What have I got?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.389
Do you really think Beth's

02:28.429 --> 02:28.980
gonna wanna

02:29.020 --> 02:29.689
spend the rest of her life

02:29.729 --> 02:30.389
with the...

02:33.000 --> 02:34.620
bloke off the fish counter?

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
Yeah. I do actually, yeah.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.980
But we need to put this back.

02:47.020 --> 02:47.580
And we need to get Ian

02:47.620 --> 02:47.980
to the hospital

02:48.020 --> 02:50.000
one way or another.

02:51.000 --> 02:51.752
So are you going to help me

02:51.792 --> 02:52.292
or what?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
[smacks lips]

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Come on then.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.980
Such a fucking goody

03:07.020 --> 03:09.000
two shoes, ain't ya?

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
[coughing]

03:16.000 --> 03:17.980
Ian? I am shocked.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.869
Sorry lads. I can't let you

03:19.909 --> 03:20.980
take that money.

03:21.020 --> 03:21.980
Excuse me, mister.

03:22.020 --> 03:22.499
We were literally coming

03:22.539 --> 03:22.980
in here to give this...

03:23.020 --> 03:24.025
-[gun clicks]

03:24.065 --> 03:25.000
-[bag thuds]

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Mmm.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.501
-[gun fires]

03:30.541 --> 03:31.201
-[groaning]

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Oh, come on...

03:39.000 --> 03:39.980
[groans]

03:40.020 --> 03:41.000
d

03:47.000 --> 03:48.133
Which one of you little

03:48.173 --> 03:49.193
fuckers is Nicky?

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
[Kim grunting]

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
[groaning]

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
[Tina] Come on. Own up.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
It's me. I'm Nicky.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.980
No. I'm Nicky.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.980
Actually, it is him.

04:15.020 --> 04:15.963
Sorry bro, but when she

04:16.003 --> 04:16.980
pointed that thing at me

04:17.020 --> 04:18.080
I was like, "Nah, do you know

04:18.120 --> 04:18.980
what I mean? Fuck that!"

04:19.020 --> 04:20.000
Shut it.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.980
What's that?

04:24.020 --> 04:24.772
Oh, yeah. Like I'm gonna fall

04:24.812 --> 04:24.980
for that

04:25.020 --> 04:26.980
"it's behind you" thing.

04:27.020 --> 04:28.700
No, seriously. What is that?

04:29.000 --> 04:30.980
[Kim shouting]

04:31.020 --> 04:31.587
-[Tina] Kim!

04:31.627 --> 04:31.980
-[thuds]

04:32.020 --> 04:32.441
-[Tina] Oh!

04:32.481 --> 04:32.980
-[Kim grunts]

04:33.020 --> 04:33.935
-[Kim] Oh, my head!

04:33.975 --> 04:34.980
-[Tina] Are you okay?

04:35.020 --> 04:35.980
[Kim groans]

04:36.020 --> 04:37.081
-[Kim] Get me up!

04:37.121 --> 04:37.980
-[Tina grunts]

04:38.020 --> 04:38.600
-Are you all right?

04:38.640 --> 04:38.980
-[Kim sighs]

04:39.020 --> 04:40.570
This is the last time you put

04:40.610 --> 04:41.980
me in a fucking bag, okay?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.259
Well, maybe I wouldn't have to

04:43.299 --> 04:43.980
put you in a bag,

04:44.020 --> 04:44.980
if you didn't...

04:45.020 --> 04:46.698
[Kim] There is no reasonable

04:46.738 --> 04:47.980
end to that sentence.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.980
How do you not understand that?

04:50.020 --> 04:51.081
Don't worry, Kim.

04:51.121 --> 04:51.980
I've got this.

04:52.020 --> 04:52.980
All right, sunshine,

04:53.020 --> 04:53.579
don't give yourself

04:53.619 --> 04:53.980
a nose bleed.

04:54.020 --> 04:54.980
I won't, actually...

04:55.020 --> 04:56.219
Okay, I only get them

04:56.259 --> 04:56.980
in the summer

04:57.020 --> 04:58.760
when I sneeze too much, so...

04:59.000 --> 04:59.980
Stop it. Both of you.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.980
Nicky, Jay,

05:02.020 --> 05:04.000
this is Tina. My mum.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
I'm just gonna...

05:22.000 --> 05:22.433
[Nicky] Hey, thanks

05:22.473 --> 05:23.853
for coming back for us.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.980
Just start cleaning, okay?

05:26.020 --> 05:28.000
We've not got long.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
[Tina sighs]

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
[engine revs]

07:05.000 --> 07:06.480
So, Jimmy doesn't like

07:06.520 --> 07:07.980
new people, all right?

07:08.020 --> 07:08.980
So keep your mouth shut

07:09.020 --> 07:09.469
unless he talks

07:09.509 --> 07:10.469
to you directly.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.314
But, he knows I've met Terri

07:12.354 --> 07:12.980
though, right?

07:13.020 --> 07:13.458
You told him that

07:13.498 --> 07:13.980
she vouched for me?

07:14.020 --> 07:15.510
Yeah, yeah. That's all sorted.

07:15.550 --> 07:17.290
Just keep your answers short,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.740
don't look him in the eyes...

07:22.000 --> 07:22.443
And if you could say

07:22.483 --> 07:22.980
you're allergic to bees

07:23.020 --> 07:24.820
that would really help me out.

07:25.000 --> 07:25.980
Sorry, bees?

07:26.020 --> 07:26.944
Yeah, Jim keeps them at

07:26.984 --> 07:27.980
the bottom of the garden.

07:28.020 --> 07:28.562
He's always banging

07:28.602 --> 07:29.442
on about them.

07:30.000 --> 07:30.980
Drives me up the wall.

07:31.020 --> 07:31.931
So, like when I'm

07:31.971 --> 07:32.980
introducing myself,

07:33.020 --> 07:34.206
I'll just kind of drop in

07:34.246 --> 07:34.980
the information.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.165
No, no. Don't volunteer

07:36.205 --> 07:36.980
the information.

07:37.020 --> 07:37.538
Otherwise, he'll know

07:37.578 --> 07:38.598
I've prepped you.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.980
So, is this a problem?

07:41.020 --> 07:41.361
It's just a lot

07:41.401 --> 07:41.980
to think about, isn't it,

07:42.020 --> 07:42.919
when I'm already trying

07:42.959 --> 07:43.980
to make a good impression?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.414
You know what, forget it,

07:45.454 --> 07:45.980
all right?

07:46.020 --> 07:47.103
Okay? But don't blame me

07:47.143 --> 07:47.980
if we're still here

07:48.020 --> 07:48.469
at four o'clock

07:48.509 --> 07:48.980
in the afternoon

07:49.020 --> 07:50.980
discussing the wider impact

07:51.020 --> 07:52.122
of fucking bee population

07:52.162 --> 07:52.980
decline, all right?

07:53.020 --> 07:55.000
It's a serious issue.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
[Brooks] Jim!

08:03.000 --> 08:04.000
Ian?

08:08.000 --> 08:09.980
Go on, then.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.000
Chop, chop!

08:19.000 --> 08:20.000
[cocks gun]

08:39.000 --> 08:39.534
You better come look

08:39.574 --> 08:40.534
at this. [sighs]

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh...

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
Oh, fuck!

09:04.000 --> 09:06.000
[inhaling]

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
[coughing]

09:13.000 --> 09:14.000
[engine revs]

09:26.000 --> 09:27.039
[Jay] Okay, look, this is

09:27.079 --> 09:27.980
my girlfriend's house.

09:28.020 --> 09:29.980
So... listen.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.631
Beth will be back

09:31.671 --> 09:32.980
at 8:00, okay?

09:33.020 --> 09:34.570
And I want everything exactly

09:34.610 --> 09:35.980
the same as how it is now.

09:36.020 --> 09:37.980
[gun clattering]

09:38.020 --> 09:38.891
Thanks, Jay. We just need

09:38.931 --> 09:39.980
somewhere safe until nightfall

09:40.020 --> 09:41.097
and then we can bury the body

09:41.137 --> 09:42.517
and be out of your way.

09:43.000 --> 09:43.980
All right, just keep it civil.

09:44.020 --> 09:45.980
Yeah? Please.

09:46.020 --> 09:46.931
Would anyone like

09:46.971 --> 09:47.980
a chocolate finger?

09:48.020 --> 09:49.083
Oh, I didn't realize we were

09:49.123 --> 09:49.980
at kids birthday party.

09:50.020 --> 09:51.980
Mum, he's just being nice.

09:52.020 --> 09:53.000
A cup of tea?

09:54.000 --> 09:54.666
Oh, yeah, that will really

09:54.706 --> 09:54.980
hit the spot

09:55.020 --> 09:56.980
after the morning we've had.

09:57.020 --> 09:58.980
Okay. A glass of wine?

09:59.020 --> 09:59.980
Okay, King Henry the Eighth.

10:00.020 --> 10:01.841
Have you got any roast hog

10:01.881 --> 10:03.980
to go with your wine? [laughs]

10:04.020 --> 10:04.906
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm just

10:04.946 --> 10:05.980
trying to do something normal

10:06.020 --> 10:07.550
because I think a degree

10:07.590 --> 10:08.980
of normality is what's

10:09.020 --> 10:10.980
flippin' required right now.

10:11.020 --> 10:12.095
Coming from the guy who thinks

10:12.135 --> 10:12.980
it's okay to play pranks

10:13.020 --> 10:14.460
on young innocent girls.

10:22.000 --> 10:22.980
How about...

10:23.020 --> 10:25.980
[glasses clink] ...a toast...

10:26.020 --> 10:27.307
to my daughter,

10:27.347 --> 10:28.980
the avenging angel.

10:29.020 --> 10:29.929
Nah, not for me.

10:29.969 --> 10:30.980
I hate that stuff.

10:31.020 --> 10:32.054
It's chocolate milkshake

10:32.094 --> 10:32.980
that gets you pissed.

10:33.020 --> 10:33.766
-What's not to like?

10:33.806 --> 10:34.980
-Yeah, it's a bit sweet, innit?

10:35.020 --> 10:35.448
[Tina] Ah, so men

10:35.488 --> 10:35.980
are still pretending

10:36.020 --> 10:37.488
not to like things that they

10:37.528 --> 10:38.980
obviously do like, are they?

10:39.020 --> 10:39.476
He doesn't like it.

10:39.516 --> 10:39.980
It's not a big deal.

10:40.020 --> 10:42.579
It is, Kim, because nothing's

10:42.619 --> 10:44.980
changed in 15 bloody years.

10:45.020 --> 10:45.980
And this is the world

10:46.020 --> 10:47.357
that you're so desperate

10:47.397 --> 10:47.980
to explore.

10:48.020 --> 10:48.560
One where no one's free

10:48.600 --> 10:48.980
to be themselves.

10:49.020 --> 10:49.326
That's what

10:49.366 --> 10:49.980
you're signing up to.

10:50.020 --> 10:51.137
Which is far more dangerous

10:51.177 --> 10:51.980
than Jimmy ever was.

10:52.020 --> 10:53.040
So drink up, Jay,

10:54.000 --> 10:54.670
'cause let me tell you

10:54.710 --> 10:54.980
something.

10:55.020 --> 10:55.438
Ninety-nine percent

10:55.478 --> 10:56.858
of the world's problems

10:57.000 --> 10:58.092
would be solved overnight

10:58.132 --> 10:58.980
if men just admitted

10:59.020 --> 11:00.459
that they like three things,

11:00.499 --> 11:01.980
sweet drinks, musical theater

11:02.020 --> 11:03.980
and a finger up the arse.

11:04.020 --> 11:05.712
[sighs] But they don't,

11:05.752 --> 11:07.000
and around we go.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.320
[Kim] I need some air.

11:23.000 --> 11:23.480
-[door opens]

11:23.520 --> 11:24.300
-[Nicky] Kim!

11:25.000 --> 11:25.831
-Kim, Hold up!

11:25.871 --> 11:27.011
-[Kim] What, Nicky?

11:28.000 --> 11:28.980
What do you want?

11:29.020 --> 11:31.000
[sighs]

11:33.000 --> 11:34.246
Can I introduce you

11:34.286 --> 11:35.000
to someone?

11:36.000 --> 11:36.497
I think she might

11:36.537 --> 11:37.497
be able to help.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
There she is.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
Mrs. Lonely Tree.

11:55.000 --> 11:55.980
When I was little,

11:56.020 --> 11:56.980
me and my dad used to...

11:57.020 --> 11:58.280
try and cheer her up.

11:59.000 --> 11:59.721
Make her little daisy chains

11:59.761 --> 12:00.361
and stuff.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.980
When he died, I found this was

12:04.020 --> 12:05.233
the only place where

12:05.273 --> 12:06.000
I could cry.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.020
She looks so sad.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.167
I'm sorry for lying

12:16.207 --> 12:16.980
to you, okay?

12:17.020 --> 12:19.000
It was stupid.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.740
But I'm still trying to help.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.896
Even though I'm really

12:23.936 --> 12:25.496
fucking scared. [chuckles]

12:26.000 --> 12:27.080
And even though...

12:28.000 --> 12:29.320
I've got a piece of...

12:30.000 --> 12:31.980
fucking brain in my pocket!

12:32.020 --> 12:32.423
-Jesus!

12:32.463 --> 12:33.003
-[laughs]

12:34.000 --> 12:34.291
-Ugh!

12:34.331 --> 12:35.000
-Come here.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
[Nicky] Uh...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.020
I'm still here...

12:47.000 --> 12:47.544
because every time

12:47.584 --> 12:48.424
I look at you,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.620
it reminds me of that tree.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.889
I'm still trying to work out

12:56.929 --> 12:58.000
what that means.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.480
I think it means that

13:00.520 --> 13:01.980
out of the two of us,

13:02.020 --> 13:03.280
you're the weird one.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.980
[both chuckle]

13:07.020 --> 13:09.384
-Which is... unexpected.

13:09.424 --> 13:10.000
-Yeah.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
[Nicky laughs]

13:40.000 --> 13:40.980
[Jay sighs]

13:41.020 --> 13:42.195
There are gonna be some

13:42.235 --> 13:42.980
very bad people

13:43.020 --> 13:45.000
looking for that money.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.980
Get rid of it.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.100
Do you understand?

13:52.000 --> 13:53.000
Good lad.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.000
[sighs]

14:00.000 --> 14:00.980
[Brooks] Hi, Terri.

14:01.020 --> 14:02.132
So, it looks like it was Ian

14:02.172 --> 14:02.980
that killed your dad.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.272
[clicking gun] He's run off

14:04.312 --> 14:04.980
with the money.

14:05.020 --> 14:06.156
Me and Thompson are just

14:06.196 --> 14:07.216
at the house now.

14:08.000 --> 14:08.980
Huh?

14:09.020 --> 14:09.980
Yeah, sure.

14:10.020 --> 14:11.520
She wants to talk to you.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
Hi, Terri.

14:14.000 --> 14:14.582
I'm so sorry about

14:14.622 --> 14:14.980
your father.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.160
[mumbles] Fuck off.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
f

14:19.000 --> 14:19.980
Yeah, I know what you mean.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.811
Bit of an old dog new tricks

14:21.851 --> 14:22.980
sort of situation.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.980
Exactly.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.000
Bye.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.958
Yeah, I can assure you

14:28.998 --> 14:30.378
I'm in complete cont...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Hello?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.723
Hello, Linda love.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.000
Is Ian about?

15:01.000 --> 15:02.080
[Kim] Right, me and Mum

15:02.120 --> 15:02.980
will dig the grave.

15:03.020 --> 15:05.000
Mum and I, will dig the grave.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
Really! Now?

15:08.000 --> 15:09.149
You don't have to come with us,

15:09.189 --> 15:09.980
but we could really do

15:10.020 --> 15:10.980
with someone to keep watch.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.980
I watch stuff all the time.

15:13.020 --> 15:13.980
Telly...

15:14.020 --> 15:15.580
My language around my nan.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.980
Okay, great.

15:18.020 --> 15:18.768
-Thank you.

15:18.808 --> 15:19.980
-[stutters] Yo...

15:20.020 --> 15:21.298
Stay here with me, kid.

15:21.338 --> 15:21.980
Are you mad?

15:22.020 --> 15:22.980
I will be fine.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.344
You do realize that

15:24.384 --> 15:25.980
if you get in that car,

15:26.020 --> 15:27.379
you'll be accessorizing

15:27.419 --> 15:27.980
the crime.

15:28.020 --> 15:28.980
Accessorizing, yeah?

15:29.020 --> 15:30.072
Like a fancy clutch

15:30.112 --> 15:31.072
or a cummerbund?

15:32.000 --> 15:32.549
You weren't laughing

15:32.589 --> 15:33.489
when Gary Flint

15:34.000 --> 15:34.980
stole your World Cup 2002

15:35.020 --> 15:36.980
sticker book, were you?

15:37.020 --> 15:38.057
And who broke his nose

15:38.097 --> 15:38.980
with a baseball bat

15:39.020 --> 15:39.980
to get it back?

15:40.020 --> 15:40.961
It was a table tennis bat

15:41.001 --> 15:41.980
and you bruised his cheek.

15:42.020 --> 15:43.156
Now, listen. It's my job

15:43.196 --> 15:43.980
to look after you

15:44.020 --> 15:45.062
and I don't understand what

15:45.102 --> 15:45.980
you're doing right now.

15:46.020 --> 15:46.980
We should just go

15:47.020 --> 15:49.000
to the police, man, surely?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.680
Look, I'm just trying to put

15:52.000 --> 15:52.595
the toothpaste back

15:52.635 --> 15:52.980
in the tube.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.000
Okay?

15:58.000 --> 15:58.604
All right. Do you know what,

15:58.644 --> 15:58.980
do what you want.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.444
But don't bring them

16:00.484 --> 16:01.980
back here. All right?

16:02.020 --> 16:03.272
Take them back to our house

16:03.312 --> 16:03.980
when it's done.

16:04.020 --> 16:04.980
Okay.

16:05.020 --> 16:06.000
Time to go.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.544
Oh, you might want

16:07.584 --> 16:07.980
to get a coat.

16:08.020 --> 16:08.980
I think it's going to rain.

16:09.020 --> 16:09.987
Oh, no, I've checked my app

16:10.027 --> 16:11.647
and it's not going to rain.

16:12.000 --> 16:12.980
But, look at those clouds.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.980
[both chuckle]

16:15.020 --> 16:15.980
What?

16:16.020 --> 16:16.980
Well, it's just that no one

16:17.020 --> 16:18.595
-looks at stuff anymore, Kim.

16:18.635 --> 16:18.980
-But...

16:19.020 --> 16:20.980
We're gonna be fine. [chuckles]

16:21.020 --> 16:21.980
Trust me.

16:22.020 --> 16:23.297
It honestly shouldn't

16:23.337 --> 16:23.980
be raining.

16:24.020 --> 16:25.340
I, I don't understand.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.147
[Tina] Just stay here

16:28.187 --> 16:28.980
and keep watch.

16:29.020 --> 16:29.980
If anyone comes,

16:30.020 --> 16:31.394
just do the mating call

16:31.434 --> 16:32.980
of the Chinese water deer.

16:33.020 --> 16:34.044
Or maybe something

16:34.084 --> 16:34.980
a little easier.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.011
Okay, the mating call

16:36.051 --> 16:37.251
of any deer will do.

16:38.000 --> 16:38.890
If anyone comes

16:38.930 --> 16:39.980
just blow on this.

16:40.020 --> 16:40.980
Okay. Cool.

16:41.020 --> 16:42.160
Uh, great. Awesome.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.367
-[Kim] One, two, three...

16:44.407 --> 16:44.980
-Good luck.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.000
d

17:24.000 --> 17:24.980
d

17:25.020 --> 17:27.000
[Beth] Hi, babe. I'm home.

17:44.000 --> 17:45.980
[Beth chuckles]

17:46.020 --> 17:47.000
Nice day, then?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.980
Bit of a bloody mess

17:50.020 --> 17:50.588
from start to finish

17:50.628 --> 17:50.980
to be honest.

17:51.020 --> 17:51.558
-You?

17:51.598 --> 17:54.000
-Yeah. [scoffs] Same.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.980
Did you know that capers

18:04.020 --> 18:05.064
are actually pickled

18:05.104 --> 18:06.124
nasturtium seeds?

18:07.000 --> 18:07.551
-Really?

18:07.591 --> 18:07.980
-Yeah,

18:08.020 --> 18:08.877
you see, I'm not

18:08.917 --> 18:10.117
so stupid now, am I?

18:11.000 --> 18:11.835
I don't think you are stupid,

18:11.875 --> 18:11.980
babe.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.669
You learn something new

18:13.709 --> 18:14.980
every day with me.

18:15.020 --> 18:15.953
-Well, exactly.

18:15.993 --> 18:17.000
-[clears throat]

18:19.000 --> 18:20.147
-What about you then?

18:20.187 --> 18:20.980
-What about me?

18:21.020 --> 18:22.685
I don't know. Have you got

18:22.725 --> 18:23.980
anything to teach me

18:24.020 --> 18:25.000
or tell me?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Like what?

18:29.000 --> 18:29.980
Well, nothing.

18:30.020 --> 18:31.160
I'm just wondering.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.469
Oh, do you want a glass

18:38.509 --> 18:38.980
of wine?

18:39.020 --> 18:40.980
No, I'm off booze for a bit

18:41.020 --> 18:42.760
until this merger's complete.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
[smacks lips] Good idea. Nice.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.000
[rain pattering]

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
[animal crying]

19:27.000 --> 19:29.186
[Tina] See, this is nice,

19:29.226 --> 19:29.980
isn't it?

19:30.020 --> 19:31.144
Just the two of us

19:31.184 --> 19:31.980
in the woods.

19:32.020 --> 19:33.980
[Kim] Digging a grave?

19:34.020 --> 19:35.745
[Tina] Well, you made quite

19:35.785 --> 19:37.000
a mess, didn't you?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.430
We cleaned it up together,

19:39.470 --> 19:40.070
didn't we?

19:42.000 --> 19:43.560
And I'm very proud of you.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.866
-Really, really proud.

19:45.906 --> 19:46.980
-[Kim grunts]

19:47.020 --> 19:48.000
Whoa!

19:51.000 --> 19:52.205
I should have told you

19:52.245 --> 19:53.085
I was leaving.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.980
I'm sorry.

19:55.020 --> 19:56.520
Oh, no. You're all right.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.243
We'll be back home soon,

19:58.283 --> 19:59.123
anyway, and...

20:00.000 --> 20:00.480
everything can just

20:00.520 --> 20:01.660
get back to normal.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
Actually, Mum...

20:06.000 --> 20:07.020
What? What is it?

20:53.000 --> 20:53.417
So let me just

20:53.457 --> 20:54.537
get this straight.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.000
You met a tree

20:57.000 --> 20:57.761
that made you re-evaluate

20:57.801 --> 20:57.980
things?

20:58.020 --> 20:59.980
Exactly.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.336
And it was like looking

21:01.376 --> 21:01.980
in a mirror

21:02.020 --> 21:02.980
because she was just

21:03.020 --> 21:04.756
stuck in the same place

21:04.796 --> 21:05.980
her entire life.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.257
Not changing anymore,

21:07.297 --> 21:07.980
not growing.

21:08.020 --> 21:10.000
Just rooted to the spot.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.980
I understand that.

21:16.020 --> 21:16.980
I do.

21:17.020 --> 21:19.328
The thing is about trees,

21:19.368 --> 21:19.980
though,

21:20.020 --> 21:21.188
is that when one of them

21:21.228 --> 21:21.980
is under attack,

21:22.020 --> 21:23.188
they send signals to all

21:23.228 --> 21:24.188
the nearby trees

21:25.000 --> 21:25.526
so they can put up

21:25.566 --> 21:25.980
their defenses.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.240
[Kim] Okay, I see what

21:27.280 --> 21:28.060
you're doing.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.480
And did you know that

21:30.520 --> 21:31.980
there are older trees

21:32.020 --> 21:32.439
sometimes known

21:32.479 --> 21:32.980
as mother trees...

21:33.020 --> 21:34.000
Ugh.

21:35.000 --> 21:35.700
[Tina] ...that can use fungi

21:35.740 --> 21:35.980
in the soil

21:36.020 --> 21:36.980
to send sugar to seedlings

21:37.020 --> 21:38.387
so they have a better chance

21:38.427 --> 21:38.980
of survival?

21:39.020 --> 21:39.989
You're trying to

21:40.029 --> 21:40.980
out metaphor me,

21:41.020 --> 21:42.640
and it's not going to work.

21:45.000 --> 21:45.980
[Tina] Trees might look lonely.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.299
But they're communicating

21:47.339 --> 21:48.119
all the time.

21:49.000 --> 21:49.684
It's only when you tear up

21:49.724 --> 21:49.980
their roots

21:50.020 --> 21:52.000
that they die.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.457
What you do next is entirely

21:57.497 --> 21:57.980
up to you,

21:58.020 --> 21:58.502
but there will be

21:58.542 --> 21:58.980
dangerous people

21:59.020 --> 22:00.000
looking for us.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.056
So all I ask is that we

22:02.096 --> 22:02.980
go back to the cabin

22:03.020 --> 22:04.980
and make that decision there,

22:05.020 --> 22:06.000
where it's safe.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.593
And that's just sensible.

22:09.633 --> 22:10.000
Right?

22:12.000 --> 22:13.385
Come on, we got

22:13.425 --> 22:15.000
to get this done.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.500
What the hell's going on?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.021
-Sorry, mate.

22:46.061 --> 22:47.000
-[gun fires]

23:11.000 --> 23:11.980
[Beth] Jay! Coming to bed?

23:12.020 --> 23:14.000
Yeah, one sec.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.226
A man in reception says

23:43.266 --> 23:43.980
he's witnessed

23:44.020 --> 23:44.810
a murder up at

23:44.850 --> 23:46.050
Jimmy Davies' house.

23:47.000 --> 23:48.266
I thought you might like to

23:48.306 --> 23:49.206
hear it direct.

23:50.000 --> 23:50.762
[Brooks] Jimmy Davies' house

23:50.802 --> 23:51.302
you say?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.007
Why don't you show

23:55.047 --> 23:56.067
the gentleman in?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.317
["Why Don't You Do Right?"

24:00.357 --> 24:01.137
song playing]
