00:21.421 --> 00:23.423
God.

00:32.932 --> 00:35.900
Oh, God. What?

00:35.935 --> 00:39.005
- Waffles again today?
- Are you hearing this?

00:39.506 --> 00:41.941
I don't know if it's
the pipes, the radiator--

00:41.976 --> 00:44.461
It's like being in
a goddamn steel mill.

00:44.496 --> 00:46.946
Oh, you're right,
that's really annoying.

00:46.981 --> 00:50.415
Good night.

00:50.450 --> 00:55.420
How can you sleep through
this? Listen.

00:55.455 --> 00:59.959
Ching chang, ting tong-- it's like being
in a goddamn Chinese graduation ceremony.

00:59.994 --> 01:01.760
After a while,
you get used to it.

01:01.795 --> 01:05.263
- There's no way
I'm getting used to this.

01:05.298 --> 01:08.084
I'm going downstairs in the
lounge. No, Tommy, don't.

01:08.119 --> 01:10.870
Perolli sees we're sleeping
here off-duty, we're screwed.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.671
- Well, you're not helping things.
- What did I do?

01:13.706 --> 01:17.710
Shh! You've been sawing wood over
there, like Paul goddamn Bunyan.

01:17.745 --> 01:21.679
You know, you got a real rosy glow
about you tonight, you know that?

01:21.714 --> 01:25.218
It's not my fault we're all cooped up in
here. If it bothers you, go to a hotel.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.721
Me in a hotel with a minibar--
now, how does that story end?

01:28.756 --> 01:31.689
What do you want me to do,
read youGoodnight Moon?

01:31.724 --> 01:35.728
For God sakes, why don't you go to your
father's house and crash with the kids?

01:35.763 --> 01:37.695
Oh, yeah, like that's
not a sobriety test.

01:37.730 --> 01:40.698
Guy's drinking triple martinis
at 11:00 in the morning. No.

01:40.733 --> 01:45.738
I need this. I need peace and quiet.
I need some time to think, you know?

01:47.240 --> 01:50.208
I got to figure out my
situation on all possible angles.

01:50.243 --> 01:53.746
I gotta-- I got to really, you know,
figure out what it is I want to do,

01:53.781 --> 01:57.767
and how I want to do it before
I go about doing it, you know?

01:57.802 --> 02:01.754
It's kind of a, you know,
important juncture in--

02:01.789 --> 02:05.258
in my life
right now, so--

02:11.264 --> 02:14.732
You ready to go home, kiddo?
Good.

02:14.767 --> 02:17.770
Hey, uh, Laura, thanks for hanging
with me for the last couple of days.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.237
You know, I know you had
other things to do.

02:19.272 --> 02:23.276
Oh, of course, I'm glad
she's okay. Yeah, me too.

02:23.311 --> 02:25.778
Come on, champ.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.282
Thanks.
No problem.

02:30.283 --> 02:32.785
Okay, Keela, good night.

02:35.288 --> 02:38.791
So, it's getting kind of late,
so I think I'll just, uh--

02:38.826 --> 02:42.295
Why don't you
come home with us?

02:42.330 --> 02:44.797
No, that's okay, come on.

03:07.820 --> 03:11.324
Wanna borrow my cross? You can carry it
around for a while, see how that feels.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.826
Not in the mood.

03:14.327 --> 03:18.331
Your stash is getting kind of low. Looks
like you'll be seeing a lot more of me.

03:18.366 --> 03:21.334
Not tonight pal, okay?

03:24.837 --> 03:26.839
Not tonight.

04:05.311 --> 04:08.314
Shh. She's sleeping.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.903
I don't know why
I keep doing it to myself.

04:32.905 --> 04:36.409
To my family,
to all my friends--

04:38.911 --> 04:42.380
Most of them don't
even talk to me anymore.

04:42.415 --> 04:45.084
They know I'm trying.
I tell them myself I'm trying.

04:45.451 --> 04:49.188
But I guess I have long since
passed the point of forgiveness.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.692
You remember this guy?

04:52.727 --> 04:55.695
Yeah.
That's him.

04:57.697 --> 04:59.699
That's who?
Perolli's mole.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.037
I don't think so.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.608
Will you relax?

05:10.943 --> 05:13.244
No. That's it.
Tom.

05:13.279 --> 05:16.549
No. What's
your problem, asshole? Huh?

05:18.785 --> 05:22.455
Jesus Christ! What the hell
is the matter with you, man?

05:22.490 --> 05:25.275
Give Perolli this message.
Kiss my ass, okay!

05:25.310 --> 05:27.853
- What?
- You heard what I said. By the way.

05:27.888 --> 05:30.396
A good spy doesn't make
himself known, jerk-off.

05:30.697 --> 05:34.567
I was telling you to take off your
sunglasses, it's disrespectful, you douche.

05:35.802 --> 05:39.806
Oh, sorry everybody.
Sorry.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.475
- How about a hand, man?
- Yeah, like I was born yesterday.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.977
Give Perolli
the message, asshole.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.118
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

05:54.153 --> 05:57.490
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

05:57.525 --> 06:00.291
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:00.326 --> 06:03.628
Things were good
when we were young

06:03.663 --> 06:06.999
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

06:07.034 --> 06:10.336
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

06:10.371 --> 06:13.638
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

06:13.673 --> 06:16.926
Things were good
when we were young

06:16.961 --> 06:20.144
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

06:20.179 --> 06:23.332
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

06:23.367 --> 06:26.611
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

06:26.646 --> 06:29.856
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

06:36.696 --> 06:39.163
Hey, Pete, need a hand?

06:39.198 --> 06:43.536
- Hey, who the hell are you?
- Oh, um, Steve Bowden.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.504
What the hell are you doing
with my tools?

06:46.539 --> 06:48.808
Sink was backed up.
I kind of took the liberty.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.060
Maybe you could show me
the courtesy of telling me...

06:51.095 --> 06:53.154
exactly what the hell
you're doing in my kitchen.

06:53.189 --> 06:55.179
Jeannie let me in, because
Peter was in the shower.

06:55.214 --> 06:57.550
She told me just to wait
downstairs while she got dressed.

06:57.585 --> 07:00.553
- You're a friend of Peter's?
- He's my partner.

07:00.787 --> 07:03.656
He didn't tell you I was coming?
No, he never mentioned it.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.356
Geez, I'm sorry.
It's all right.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.394
Yeah. Things have been a little
bit upside down here lately.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.997
You're not the first stranger that
I've stumbled across in my own house.

07:11.032 --> 07:12.732
Completely
understandable, Mr. Reilly.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.466
- Jerry.
- Jerry.

07:15.501 --> 07:19.238
How's it going? I think she's
done. Let's, uh, check it out.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.706
Wow. Home run.

07:21.741 --> 07:23.743
Coffee?
Already brewed.

07:24.243 --> 07:27.246
Already brewed.
Not wastin' much time, huh?

07:27.747 --> 07:29.714
Well, we only have
so much of it, Jer.

07:29.749 --> 07:33.753
You know, that's exactly the attitude
you guys should bring into your business.

07:33.788 --> 07:36.422
Business? The business that
you're in with my son Peter.

07:36.656 --> 07:38.691
I was telling him, you know, "If
you're going to be a firefighter,

07:38.726 --> 07:40.593
"you need to get something
going on the outside,

07:41.093 --> 07:44.096
because you're never gonna make
enough money eating smoke."

07:44.131 --> 07:46.599
So, what kind of business
are you guys goin' into?

07:46.634 --> 07:50.036
- Restaurant, bar, disco?
- Well, um--

07:50.071 --> 07:52.104
I know, top secret.

07:54.106 --> 07:56.108
Hey, you.
Hey.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.051
You got grease on your nails.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.790
Thank you, Ann.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.258
- Kenny?
- Sondra.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.630
Hey, wow. I can't believe I'm
running into you like this.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.966
Yeah, what are the odds,
huh? Pretty slim, I'd say.

08:20.001 --> 08:23.469
Obviously, not that slim.

08:23.970 --> 08:25.937
So, how's it going?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.974
Uh, uh, it's going okay.

08:28.474 --> 08:31.477
Uh, you know, I'm actually,
uh, a little late for work.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.212
But, uh-- uh, how are you?
Pretty good.

08:34.246 --> 08:38.448
I'm kind of comin' out of
this subpar relationship.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.988
He was a soap opera actor. Good-looking
men are so high maintenance.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.757
Yeah, I've, uh, heard that. And his
wife was a total pain in the tits.

08:44.792 --> 08:48.160
You know? Really possessive. Bitch.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.127
No shit.

08:50.162 --> 08:52.665
It's kind of hot though,
you know? How wrong it was.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.001
She even got this
private detective...

08:55.368 --> 08:58.838
to follow us to this sleazy motel
that we always used to go to.

08:59.338 --> 09:05.011
Yeah. He took some real provocative
peep-show-like shots of us in the act.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.514
So, what's your story? Uh,
you know, same-old, same-old.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.651
Work is work. Sold the house.
Waiting to close on another one,

09:11.686 --> 09:14.287
but my wife's lawyers got me
in kind of a limbo right now.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.023
Trying to get that
cleared up-- Wrong story.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.156
What?
Are you seeing anyone?

09:19.191 --> 09:23.629
Me? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. No kidding?

09:23.896 --> 09:27.867
Why would I kid? I mean, s-she's
great. You know, uh, Linda is great.

09:27.902 --> 09:32.471
Linda's great. Linda, huh?
What does she look like?

09:32.738 --> 09:35.172
You know, like a woman.
She's, um--

09:35.207 --> 09:38.711
You know, she's got kind of beautiful
long-- you know, kind of dark hair, brown.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.679
She's about 5'8",
you know, 115 pounds or so.

09:41.714 --> 09:46.218
She's a-- She's a trader down on Wall
Street, you know, the stock exchange.

09:46.253 --> 09:49.020
Happy?
Whew! Happy, yeah!

09:49.055 --> 09:54.060
I mean Linda's-- She's
a wonderful, beautiful, smart,

09:54.095 --> 09:58.564
sexy, talented, generous woman.

10:00.566 --> 10:04.170
- A little possessive though.
- Hmm.

10:07.573 --> 10:13.311
Hey. Hey!
You going deaf?

10:13.346 --> 10:17.583
What? Oh, this? I got this from a buddy
of mine who runs a surveillance company.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.853
Matter of fact, I got
a direct line...

10:19.888 --> 10:22.053
to your man down
at the front desk.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.055
Just in case Janet tries
to bum rush this place.

10:24.090 --> 10:28.059
- Connor, could you
please knock that off?

10:28.094 --> 10:31.896
He just take his pill.
You no yell at him, fat man.

10:31.931 --> 10:35.101
I'm not yelling. I would just like
a little peace and quiet around here.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.936
Why don't you help teach
the children...

10:37.436 --> 10:40.272
instead of waddling around
and "compraining?"

10:40.307 --> 10:44.075
It's "complaining."
Com-plain-ing!

10:44.110 --> 10:48.114
The stupid computer crashed again, and now
I'm never gonna get my report finished, never!

10:48.149 --> 10:50.950
I think we got a security breach.
Uh, I gotta get down there.

10:52.618 --> 10:56.420
Hey, how'd you get up here? The
guy at the front desk knows me.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.959
I gotta have a chat with him. Hey,
remember I mentioned that thing to you?

10:59.994 --> 11:03.861
Right. W-Was that the hand
grenade thing? No, the pill thing.

11:03.896 --> 11:07.400
Right! Right, the Vicodin. No, no.
Who's looking for hand grenades?

11:07.900 --> 11:10.903
Nobody. I'll make sure Miami
Mike gets in touch with you.

11:11.404 --> 11:14.240
All right.
See you.

11:14.275 --> 11:16.475
Hey!

11:19.145 --> 11:22.982
Well, don't all jump up at once.
It's just your old man.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.236
Nice.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.156
Hey.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.493
Hey.

11:34.994 --> 11:39.932
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Okay, snack time.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.335
Come on. Up, up, up, up. Out. Out.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.171
What's going on?

11:45.671 --> 11:48.174
Now, you know I'm trying to help
you out here as much as I can, kiddo.

11:48.209 --> 11:50.908
- You know, I love those kids
as much as you do. - Uh-huh.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.730
L-Let me throw you some scratch, you
know, help get you started someplace.

11:54.765 --> 11:58.517
Dad, I told you, I just need a couple
of more weeks. I'm making some moves.

11:58.552 --> 12:00.519
Ten days, that's
all I need, all right?

12:00.753 --> 12:04.290
I suppose a little while longer won't
kill me. But if it does, it's your ass!

12:04.590 --> 12:06.625
It looks like it's going pretty
good though, right? It's okay.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.628
That Jenny's a whiz at
math, you know. Yeah.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.595
Asians.
You know what I mean.

12:11.630 --> 12:13.998
Let's see what happens
when they get to the grammar.

12:14.033 --> 12:16.500
Make sure that Teddy's got this
place completely locked down,

12:16.535 --> 12:19.371
because if Janet finds out the kids
are here, we're gonna have big problems.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.707
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

12:23.709 --> 12:27.213
What, are you
drinking all day now?

12:27.713 --> 12:29.680
I'm 82, I'm retired.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.183
And I'm married to
a new and much younger woman...

12:32.218 --> 12:37.223
who's not only rich, but likes to bang
my brains out at least three times a week.

12:37.258 --> 12:41.894
So I'm not drinking, kid.
I'm in a perpetual toast.

12:42.261 --> 12:47.333
- Isn't that nice?
- It is for me.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.069
She brush her teeth?

12:50.569 --> 12:55.074
All right, good, good. Hey,
listen, Ma, I gotta run, okay?

12:55.109 --> 12:58.077
Yeah. Yeah, I love you too.
And tell her I love her.

12:58.112 --> 13:00.579
All right. Bye.

13:01.580 --> 13:03.547
Everything okay?
Yeah.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.851
Yeah, she's,
uh, she's good.

13:07.586 --> 13:11.173
- You didn't sleep much last night.
- I was worried about her.

13:11.208 --> 13:14.760
I'm worried about you. Can we
talk about this later, please?

13:15.161 --> 13:19.198
No. Later we're gonna be sitting
across the dinner table from each other,

13:19.233 --> 13:21.534
pretending we dodged a bullet
because Keela's okay.

13:21.834 --> 13:25.938
But it's not just about Keela. You haven't
said one word about the other situation,

13:26.438 --> 13:28.523
and don't pretend you don't
know what I'm talking about.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.609
Listen, there's not one pill
left in that apartment, okay?

13:31.110 --> 13:33.696
Not even Keela's Flintstones.
Good. I'm glad.

13:33.731 --> 13:36.247
But you got to talk
to somebody about this.

13:36.282 --> 13:40.286
And if it's not me, that's fine,
I totally understand, but somebody.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.921
Yeah. Okay.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.126
I was caught totally off-guard. She
asked me if I was seeing anybody.

13:47.161 --> 13:49.927
- And?
- I tried to channel you.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.930
Goddamn it. What do I tell
you guys about channeling me?

13:52.965 --> 13:55.734
Huh? What? What? Pretend you
got to take a piss, and do what?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.469
Call your cell. I know,
I know. That's right.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.436
It's not something I
learned. It's a gift. I know.

13:59.471 --> 14:04.476
- Christ! So? - I tap-danced through
this lie with the grace of an ox.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.479
- Did she buy it?
- I set the bar way too high.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.446
What did you say?

14:09.481 --> 14:12.985
I described this imaginary girlfriend,
who's the most amazing woman on the planet.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.089
You know? The type of woman I'd never
get. Oh, come on, you got Sondra.

14:16.124 --> 14:19.158
Yeah, well, the expression, "once
in a lifetime," mean anything to you?

14:19.193 --> 14:21.660
All right, well, did she buy it?
Oh, it's hard to say.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.627
She enjoyed
watching me squirm.

14:23.662 --> 14:27.166
Now, of course, the problem is, she wants
to see me out with my imaginary girlfriend.

14:27.201 --> 14:30.134
I'm done for. Nah. Not necessarily.

14:30.169 --> 14:32.671
Situations like this, this
is why God invented whores.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.139
I never thought of whores.
I know you didn't.

14:35.174 --> 14:38.677
Black Tony from 69 Truck,
he knows a site where you go on,

14:38.712 --> 14:40.679
you pick a girl, you click
the mouse, and voilàà,

14:40.714 --> 14:42.646
she shows up at your house
45 minutes later.

14:42.681 --> 14:45.184
It costs a little cabbage, but--
You know, it really is a gift.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.985
Yeah, from God or Satan.

14:48.020 --> 14:50.522
That's the problem with gifts.
No cards, no credit.

14:51.023 --> 14:53.025
Come on. We gotta go.
Grab your radio.

15:02.868 --> 15:08.040
I'm up here!
Up here!

15:08.274 --> 15:11.660
- Bust it out!
- Let's go!

15:11.695 --> 15:15.047
Look at me!
Stay right there!

15:19.652 --> 15:21.185
Here you go!

15:21.220 --> 15:23.222
- Is he breathing?
- I gave him mouth to mouth.

15:23.257 --> 15:26.690
I thought I felt a pulse,
you know?

15:26.725 --> 15:28.977
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- St. Ann's, I think.

15:29.012 --> 15:31.230
That's pretty close by. He
should be all right. Yeah.

15:31.265 --> 15:33.232
Uh, Tommy.
What?

15:33.267 --> 15:35.532
Uh--
What?

15:35.567 --> 15:38.737
The kid's lips, they're,
uh, they're stuck to yours.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.741
On the bottom too.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.244
Oh, you're good now.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.584
Step on up.
Let's go.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.742
Hey.
What's up?

16:18.777 --> 16:22.281
What's going on?
That was pretty messed up, huh?

16:22.316 --> 16:25.784
Yeah. The worst I've ever seen. Yeah.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.789
Listen, Tommy, I need to talk
to you for a second, man.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.590
It's about the pills.

16:33.625 --> 16:36.628
Frankie, look, I--
I don't--

16:36.663 --> 16:39.596
You don't have
to say anything.

16:39.631 --> 16:42.134
Things have been really
getting away from me lately.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.268
I gotta get clean.

16:44.303 --> 16:47.271
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's--

16:47.306 --> 16:51.577
If you really feel like they're gettin'
away from you, yeah, you should get clean.

16:51.612 --> 16:54.778
My little girl?
She got ahold of one.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.816
That's why she was in the hospital.
They had to pump her stomach,

16:57.851 --> 17:00.836
hold her for observation, you
know? Shit, is she all right?

17:00.871 --> 17:03.787
Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be okay.
I'm not sure about me though.

17:03.822 --> 17:07.326
Shit had its hooks in deep, you know?
It's a lot tougher to kick than I thought.

17:07.361 --> 17:09.727
Yeah, well you know what?

17:09.762 --> 17:13.731
Best thing
we could do, uh, is--

17:13.766 --> 17:17.669
is probably throw away your stash,
you know? No, I already tossed it.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.172
Oh, good.
That's-- That's good.

17:20.672 --> 17:25.176
Um, the house, the car, you check
those? Yeah, yeah. It's all gone.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.644
- That's good.
- I-I was actually hoping,

17:27.679 --> 17:30.182
maybe you could turn me on
to one of those, uh, meetings.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.149
N.A.
Yeah.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.651
You know, they have N.A. meetings
a lot of the places I go to A.A.

17:34.686 --> 17:38.190
They, uh-- Did-Did you check your
locker, to make sure-- It's all gone.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.192
It's all gone. Good.
Okay.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.029
You know, I could really-- I
could use a friend to come with.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.866
To N.A.? Um, when are you
thinking of going?

17:47.901 --> 17:49.833
Soon as possible.
Tomorrow morning?

17:49.868 --> 17:54.373
Aw, shit, I can't tomorrow. I promised my
new half brother I'd do something with him.

17:54.408 --> 17:58.143
Um, but ask Garrity. He'd
probably, uh, go with you.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.879
Yeah, yeah. That's-- That's
cool. Maybe I'll do that, thanks.

18:01.380 --> 18:06.551
Hey, uh, you know, if we're gonna do
this, and I'm gonna be your sponsor, um,

18:06.586 --> 18:11.723
maybe you should-- this is good time for
you to learn about the, uh, 13th step.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.559
I thought there was only 12.
Used to be.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.562
But, uh, this guy invented this
new step. It's called the 13th step.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.530
It's the enabler one.

18:19.565 --> 18:22.835
What it is, is you-- like, you give me the phone
numbers and contact numbers for your source.

18:22.870 --> 18:26.071
I get ahold of them and
make sure that they're, uh,

18:26.106 --> 18:29.039
unable to-to get ahold
of you in the future...

18:29.074 --> 18:33.579
if there's any kind of, you know,
pill thing that you feel like you--

18:33.614 --> 18:36.081
Just shuts that right
down. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.584
I mean, I'm pretty sure she's out
of town, but if-- Oh, it's a she?

18:39.084 --> 18:41.086
Yeah. Cool. I mean, not
cool. You know what I mean.

18:41.587 --> 18:43.554
Right!
If you think it'll help.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.591
That's why they
invented it, you know?

18:45.626 --> 18:49.094
Here we go.
Road to recovery.

18:58.604 --> 19:00.606
What?
Well, it's my cock.

19:01.106 --> 19:04.074
Oh, forget I asked. No,
no. I'm serious. Listen.

19:04.109 --> 19:06.612
I got two dead chicks on
my conscience lately, you know?

19:07.112 --> 19:10.115
Nez and Heather. It's like something's
wrong with my mojo, you know?

19:10.616 --> 19:12.583
Like my dick is some sort
of weapon of mass destruction.

19:12.618 --> 19:17.172
Hey. First of all, your dick is
not a weapon of mass destruction,

19:17.207 --> 19:21.727
because if it were, I'd be in
complete awe of you, which I am not.

19:21.762 --> 19:23.927
Okay? But there's really
two issues here, Sean,

19:23.962 --> 19:27.966
and the first issue pertains to the fact that
you have a tiny fragment of brain matter...

19:28.001 --> 19:30.486
lodged somewhere
in your skull, no offense.

19:30.521 --> 19:32.971
None taken. The second
is your dating pool,

19:33.472 --> 19:36.975
which, in my opinion, should be drained
and filled in, and blacktopped over.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.943
Maybe a playground for poor
kids built on top of it.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.981
Hey, I'm serious, Lou. Look,
you had a string of bad luck.

19:43.348 --> 19:48.587
I mean, you can't control that. What's important
is you get back on that horse and keep going.

19:48.622 --> 19:52.058
So there's nothing wrong with
my cock? No, your cock is fine.

19:52.093 --> 19:54.794
There's nothing wrong with
my mojo? It is not your mojo.

19:54.829 --> 19:57.496
Thanks, man. That-That's just
what I needed to hear. Okay.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.598
- Now go out there and get 'em.
- Go get 'em.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.632
One thing, though.
What's that?

20:01.667 --> 20:04.670
- Stay away from my nieces?
- All right, all right.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.514
I wanna know what Jimmy
said. Hey! Get out of my way.

20:16.014 --> 20:19.518
I was his wife, he was my husband. I
have a right to know what he said to you.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.819
You got a right to jack shit!
Shut up, scum! You know what?

20:22.854 --> 20:27.192
You're lower than scum. You're below
scum. You're like, um, sub-scum.

20:27.227 --> 20:31.363
Mm-hmm. You should be ashamed
of what you done to me,

20:31.398 --> 20:34.331
and Damien, and Jimmy,
you know that?

20:34.366 --> 20:38.370
You know what? I'm gonna scream my ass
off and see everyone come out here...

20:38.405 --> 20:40.973
so they can see the two of us
together-- What do you think about that?

20:41.473 --> 20:44.226
I think that nobody
gives a shit. Okay?

20:44.261 --> 20:46.944
It's like 9/11.
They've all moved on.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.981
For the first time in this
relationship, I'm not living a lie,

20:49.481 --> 20:51.383
so you could scream all you
want, nobody cares. Yeah?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.218
Yeah.

20:58.724 --> 21:00.559
That all you got?

21:06.565 --> 21:08.532
Hey, Sheil.
Hi, Sheil.

21:08.567 --> 21:12.536
Hi. Time to move on, sweetheart.

21:12.571 --> 21:17.576
Oh, oh! I've moved on.
Greener pastures, my friend.

21:17.611 --> 21:20.377
Greener frickin' pastures.

21:20.412 --> 21:23.798
I wish him luck.
He's gonna need it.

21:23.833 --> 21:27.461
- No, she won't.
- What did you say?

21:27.496 --> 21:31.089
Sheil!
Have another drink, bitch.

21:44.102 --> 21:48.206
I think I'm gonna go
and get a coffee.

21:49.441 --> 21:53.945
- Do you want more coffee, Tom?
- Yeah. That'd be great. Thanks.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.791
Pretty badly burned,
his mouth is--

22:05.826 --> 22:07.793
I know.

22:08.193 --> 22:10.228
I know what you're gonna say.

22:11.730 --> 22:13.732
I don't know why.

22:16.635 --> 22:20.604
That's great. No answers.
It's all a mystery, right?

22:20.639 --> 22:24.476
Same crap I heard from the nuns and priests
during my 12-year stretch in Catholic school.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.578
Oh, listen, Tommy--
No, no, you listen to me.

22:26.878 --> 22:30.415
I don't know what you're doing here, if
you're haunting me or what you're doin'.

22:30.882 --> 22:32.382
I don't even know
if this is real.

22:32.417 --> 22:35.786
But I don't believe in you, and I
don't believe in your old man, either.

22:35.821 --> 22:41.326
He took my cousin Jimmy, he took Patty Brown,
and Timmy Higgins and the rest of the 343.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.332
I hope your old man's
having a good time with them.

22:48.767 --> 22:50.769
I'm sorry.

22:55.273 --> 22:59.611
- You want the kid to live?
- What do you think?

22:59.646 --> 23:01.847
I'll see what I can do.

23:07.853 --> 23:11.022
- I'd like to have full use of the hands.
- I'll see what I can do.

23:14.025 --> 23:18.495
If I do this, if
I get the kid to live,

23:18.530 --> 23:23.201
will that make you believe
in me, believe in my father?

23:23.236 --> 23:26.872
Will you trust
that he has a plan?

23:28.707 --> 23:30.709
I'll try.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.659
Hey, this bringing back
any memories, Mick?

23:48.160 --> 23:50.627
Yeah. Just how hot it gets
inside that turned-around collar.

23:50.662 --> 23:54.166
Hey, either one of you guys need a roommate yet,
because I can't stay at the firehouse forever.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.633
How about Dad's place,
with the kids?

23:56.668 --> 24:00.137
Nah, he's got too much on
his hands as it is, you know?

24:00.172 --> 24:03.074
I'd like to help you out, Tom, but, uh,
Donna's kind of planted a flag already.

24:05.143 --> 24:08.645
Don't look at me.
I got the kids this weekend.

24:08.680 --> 24:11.249
Why don't you talk to Murph? See
if he can put you up at the rectory.

24:11.284 --> 24:13.251
That's where you
want me staying, at a church.

24:13.752 --> 24:16.087
I'll just lay down in the pew
and let the walls cave in.

24:16.321 --> 24:18.889
- Time to break some bread, gentlemen.
- Look at that, Father. Great.

24:18.924 --> 24:22.260
- Thanks, Father, I'm starved.
- How many times I got to tell you, it's Liam.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.930
Thanks, Liam.
That's great, thanks.

24:25.330 --> 24:28.767
Hey, can we play ball now, Father
Murphy? Just a minute, Rickey.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.769
I want to introduce you to
some new friends of mine.

24:31.269 --> 24:33.904
This is Johnny, and this is
Tommy, these are my half brothers.

24:33.939 --> 24:38.276
This is Mickey, whom I guess I call my
half cousin, if there is such a term, right?

24:38.311 --> 24:40.445
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doing?

24:40.946 --> 24:43.882
Rickey here is our
most devout altar boy.

24:44.182 --> 24:47.886
-Gonna make a fine priest one day.
- Are you coming, Father?

24:48.386 --> 24:50.388
Duty calls. Enjoy those burgers,
they're the hit of every picnic.

24:50.423 --> 24:55.425
Thanks, Father. Man.

24:55.460 --> 24:59.965
These burgers are unbelievable!
You're gonna try it?

25:00.198 --> 25:03.835
No, I lost my appetite.

25:03.870 --> 25:07.437
Oh, yeah? Your loss.

25:07.472 --> 25:09.307
Hey, why do you get
the whole thing?

25:09.541 --> 25:11.541
I don't know about this, man.

25:11.576 --> 25:16.081
Just doesn't feel right, you know? I'm not
an "open up and bare my soul" kind of guy.

25:16.116 --> 25:18.917
What the hell's the matter with you?
This is like a smorgasbord of ass.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.136
You haven't so much as blinked.
What are you talking about, Sean?

25:21.171 --> 25:23.321
You haven't noticed all the
babes crawling around this place?

25:23.822 --> 25:26.289
Jesus, bro, you really do
need help. Yeah, sorry, buddy,

25:26.324 --> 25:29.077
but pussy's kind of taken a back
seat to this little drug addiction...

25:29.112 --> 25:31.830
I'm trying to cope with. All the
more reason to ride it out, yeah?

25:32.330 --> 25:36.601
Yeah. Look, I'm gonna go mingle,
but, uh, stay strong, brother.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.805
How about this Murph guy, huh?

25:41.840 --> 25:45.844
Half these kids, they got no place
to go, they got no one to look up to--

25:45.879 --> 25:47.846
he does this shit every Saturday,
as long as the weather holds up.

25:47.881 --> 25:49.681
Hell of a guy.

25:50.181 --> 25:53.285
If they hadn't picked that old Kraut
for Pope, I'd throw my vote behind Murph.

25:55.787 --> 25:58.623
Run, run, run, run, run!
Beat it out! Beat it out!

25:58.658 --> 26:01.192
All right!

26:06.464 --> 26:09.467
They bringing prohibition back?
Why, does this bother you?

26:09.502 --> 26:12.404
A little.
I'll get rid of it.

26:12.439 --> 26:15.307
Jesus.

26:15.574 --> 26:19.544
Hey, look. Look at this.
Holy shit!

26:20.545 --> 26:22.779
Wow, who's that?
I don't know.

26:22.814 --> 26:25.317
Goddamn.
Holy shit.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.653
She's smoking.
Maybe I should talk to her.

26:28.688 --> 26:31.056
Come on.
Whoa. I got dibs.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.975
Dibs? Why do you have dibs? I got a gun.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.359
Oh, yeah? Hi, how are you doing? Hi.

26:36.394 --> 26:39.397
- I'm, uh, Tommy, this is my little brother Johnny.
- Hi, hi.

26:39.898 --> 26:42.267
- Hi, I'm Mariel.
- Hi, Mariel, what's going on?

26:42.302 --> 26:44.636
Enjoying this day.
It's great out here, huh?

26:45.170 --> 26:48.740
Incredible. I think it's great what
Murph does out here with these kids.

26:49.240 --> 26:53.745
You know, they got nowhere to go, and nobody
to look up to, and you know, every Saturday,

26:54.145 --> 26:55.680
depending on the weather
here he is out here,

26:55.947 --> 26:58.599
just making a big difference
in these kids' lives.

26:58.634 --> 27:01.217
- I think it's great.
- Yeah, it's remarkable.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.756
Yeah. It really is. Did
you say your name was Tommy?

27:04.990 --> 27:09.094
- Yes, Tommy.
- Oh, good, you've already met our sister.

27:09.129 --> 27:12.430
What?
Well, I mean, my sister.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.933
- Your half sister.
- So, we're related?

27:14.968 --> 27:16.768
We're related?
Yeah.

27:17.268 --> 27:19.771
Great. Great.

27:20.005 --> 27:22.040
So what's your vice?
Huh? Oh.

27:22.075 --> 27:25.508
I just, um, I'm in N.A.

27:25.543 --> 27:27.911
I was-- I just stepped out
for some air. You?

27:27.946 --> 27:31.950
Same. Three years now. Oh, hey,
only a year away from your diploma.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.921
- This your first meeting?
- Um, no, no.

27:37.956 --> 27:41.126
I've been-- I've been
at it for years. Coke?

27:41.161 --> 27:43.395
Uh, no, no thanks.
I'm not thirsty.

27:45.130 --> 27:48.767
Well, what was it
that got you here?

27:48.802 --> 27:52.369
Oh, oh you meant--
Uh, it was crack.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.372
Really? Yeah. I smoked
a shitload of the stuff.

27:55.407 --> 27:58.143
I remember this one time I was-- I was
in this alley, you know, hitting the pipe.

27:58.178 --> 28:01.146
And, um, I just-- Something came
over me, and I-I thought to myself,

28:01.181 --> 28:05.782
you know what, this is
just totally whack, crack.

28:05.817 --> 28:10.488
And I can get better. And that's
exactly what I intend to do.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.992
- Thanks.
- We've got time for one more.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.995
How 'bout you, sir?
In the back.

28:18.997 --> 28:21.833
I think we've heard
from everyone else.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.836
Uh, I don't think so.

28:26.337 --> 28:29.340
Hey, this is, uh, Franco's
friend Tommy again.

28:29.375 --> 28:32.308
I know I've called you
a couple of times now, um--

28:32.343 --> 28:36.347
He's in really bad shape. I really wish
you would call me back as soon as you can.

28:36.382 --> 28:39.851
I left my number before,
uh, please, thank you.

28:40.351 --> 28:42.085
Yeah?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.320
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, sweetie, what's up?

28:44.355 --> 28:49.194
Mrs. Ng took us to the park,
but it's more fun with you.

28:49.229 --> 28:52.197
I miss you, Daddy.
Mommy too.

28:52.564 --> 28:55.033
I miss you too, honey. I'm
gonna see you real soon, okay?

28:55.068 --> 28:57.100
Will you come
tuck me in tonight?

28:57.135 --> 29:01.372
Baby, I'd like to more than anything in
the world, but I-I-- Daddy's got to work.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.840
Mommy never
used to work.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.877
She stayed with us
all day long.

29:06.377 --> 29:09.881
I know, I know. Mommy-- See, mommies
and daddies have different jobs, pumpkin.

29:10.381 --> 29:14.986
- That's the way things are.
- I wouldn't miss you so much if Mommy was here.

29:15.253 --> 29:18.556
Kiddo, I gotta go now. All right? But
I-- I'll see you tomorrow, I promise.

29:19.057 --> 29:22.060
- You always promise. - No, no.
This time, I-I-- It's different.

29:22.095 --> 29:24.062
I mean it.
I'll be there, okay?

29:26.431 --> 29:29.167
Katy?

29:29.202 --> 29:31.868
Hey.

29:31.903 --> 29:34.655
Hi. What's goin' on?
Hi.

29:34.690 --> 29:37.408
Not too much.
Can you, uh--

29:37.909 --> 29:40.411
- Can you keep a secret?
- Um, not really.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.879
W-- Jesus, why didn't
you just say yes?

29:42.914 --> 29:47.252
Well, because then I'd be lying and
I'm not really good at that either.

29:47.287 --> 29:49.219
Well, Jesus, Mike,
now I'm really conflicted.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.924
- I got some juicy shit here.
- Well, come on, just tell me.

29:53.424 --> 29:56.427
Franco's got a drug problem. He got hooked
on the Vicodin he was taking for his shoulder.

29:56.462 --> 29:58.228
Oh, shit. That is juicy. I know.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.230
Is he gonna be okay?
Well, yeah, he's gonna be fine.

30:00.265 --> 30:03.268
That's not even the juicy part. He asked
me to go with him to this support group.

30:03.768 --> 30:05.937
So I tag along, you know, just to
help out. Well, that was nice of you.

30:05.972 --> 30:08.457
Yeah, I thought so.
Anyway, at the meeting,

30:08.492 --> 30:10.942
it's, like, packed
to the gills with tail, bro.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.243
No way. Yeah. Like, high-grade talent,

30:13.278 --> 30:15.745
ex-party girls, models,
actresses. Sweet!

30:15.780 --> 30:19.117
And the best part was, they were, like,
totally vulnerable, like putty in your hands.

30:19.152 --> 30:22.120
Except the kind of putty that you
could, you know, have sex with.

30:22.620 --> 30:26.124
I didn't know they made
that kind of putty.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.794
Did you bag one? Yeah, bro,
got the digits to prove it.

30:30.295 --> 30:34.132
No way. You gotta take me with you
next time. Great minds. Great minds.

30:34.167 --> 30:36.099
There's a meeting on Friday
night. It's gonna be packed...

30:36.134 --> 30:39.971
with a whole new set of
druggies, you down? You know it.

30:43.141 --> 30:46.109
Hey.
Hey. What's going on?

30:46.144 --> 30:50.982
You left your glasses
at the park. I did?

30:51.017 --> 30:53.418
Thanks.

30:53.918 --> 30:56.921
You came all the way down here to
give me a pair of lost sunglasses?

30:57.422 --> 30:59.991
Not exactly.
What's going on?

31:01.993 --> 31:04.460
Father Murphy.

31:04.495 --> 31:07.498
Great guy, huh?
Did you see his sister? Right?

31:07.999 --> 31:10.251
Oh, my God.
She's in my top 10.

31:10.286 --> 31:12.468
Hall of fame, all-time.
Oh, yeah.

31:12.503 --> 31:14.470
Jesus. Your brother already called me.

31:14.505 --> 31:17.342
Wanted to know where the Church stood
on half brother, half sister relations.

31:17.377 --> 31:20.678
What a scumbag!

31:22.013 --> 31:23.980
Where does
the, uh, Church stand,

31:24.015 --> 31:27.483
just out of curiosity, on that?
Oh, geez, I don't know, Tom.

31:27.518 --> 31:30.688
I'm not your priest anymore. Why don't
you ask your new pal, Father Murphy?

31:32.690 --> 31:35.693
What are you, jealous? Now, listen,
I've seen shit like this before, okay?

31:36.194 --> 31:38.995
That kid attached to his hip, the
way he was? Figure it out, Tom.

31:39.030 --> 31:43.368
Jesus, Mick. Garbage like that's why
I left the Church in the first place.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.970
Mick, they were
playing baseball.

31:46.005 --> 31:49.172
You gotta relax, man.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.709
I got my gut,
and I got my eyes.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.212
You want to walk
around in the dark, fine.

31:54.445 --> 31:56.981
Why don't you give me a call
when the lights come on, huh?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.983
I think you're overreacting.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.852
I never spent
enough time with him.

32:02.887 --> 32:08.559
I was always working, socking the
extra money away for some rainy day.

32:08.594 --> 32:11.396
Maybe taking him
to Disneyland.

32:12.397 --> 32:14.399
Or China.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.868
He made that same face.

32:18.903 --> 32:22.705
You got kids, Tommy?
Three.

32:22.740 --> 32:25.910
You spend a lot
of time with them?

32:26.411 --> 32:30.415
Enough to know that none
of them want to go to China.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.750
Ever.

32:34.085 --> 32:36.354
You gotta spend
time with them, Tommy.

32:36.389 --> 32:39.590
Enjoy them while you can.

32:53.771 --> 32:58.209
All right, I'll uh--
I'll see you tomorrow?

33:13.725 --> 33:16.192
Oh, yeah.

33:16.227 --> 33:19.230
Shit! Not again, Jeannie.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.300
Oh, God.

33:33.311 --> 33:38.281
Oh, God.
Oh, God, yeah.

33:38.316 --> 33:43.321
Yeah. Yeah!
Oh, yeah. You like that?

33:43.356 --> 33:45.590
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

33:45.625 --> 33:47.790
Yeah! Yeah.

33:47.825 --> 33:50.828
Who's your daddy, bitch?
You're my daddy!

33:51.329 --> 33:54.665
Do me, daddy! Do me, daddy. Do me hard!

33:59.504 --> 34:02.006
Morning, Jerry.
You're up early.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.512
Uh, can I make some coffee?

34:23.027 --> 34:25.029
Hey, Dad.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.534
Mom up yet?

34:32.036 --> 34:35.540
You know, Jerry, I got some tickets
to the Mets game this afternoon.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.543
I was thinkin', maybe
the three of us, you know--

34:40.545 --> 34:43.797
Forty years,
I've lived in this home.

34:43.833 --> 34:47.051
Never once
thought about selling.

34:47.552 --> 34:50.554
Raised you from the little
spud that you were.

34:52.056 --> 34:54.492
Used to play ball
out in back.

34:55.993 --> 34:58.496
I thought we were
a regular family.

35:00.998 --> 35:04.001
All washed away by the--
the sounds of-- Daddy.

35:04.036 --> 35:07.004
Don't you ever
call me Daddy again!

35:07.039 --> 35:09.407
Ever!

35:09.807 --> 35:12.844
With your mother sleeping
right down the hall from you?

35:13.344 --> 35:17.880
Hmm?
Steve and I are in love.

35:17.915 --> 35:20.418
We express our love
like everyone else.

35:21.752 --> 35:25.857
Mmm.
Not everyone.

35:28.359 --> 35:30.361
I can barely stand
to look at you.

35:30.661 --> 35:33.030
The feeling is mutual.

35:34.765 --> 35:39.604
Would you look at this, all my boys
are up and waiting for their breakfast.

35:41.105 --> 35:43.608
Who wants flapjacks?

35:50.615 --> 35:53.117
I gotta go, hon.
Oh, okay, Bud.

35:54.118 --> 35:57.121
Pick up some hats
while you're out.

36:00.124 --> 36:02.627
You told me
you were the man.

36:08.399 --> 36:11.367
Yeah.

36:11.402 --> 36:14.370
Hey, man, it's Mike.
Hey. Miami Mike, man.

36:14.405 --> 36:16.873
Glad to hear from you.
You got what I need? Yeah.

36:16.908 --> 36:20.411
Meet me on the corner, down-- Hang on
a second, let me grab a pen, all right?

36:20.446 --> 36:25.416
Hang on. Two secs, man.
All right.

36:28.152 --> 36:32.156
Where's Dad?
He'll be here.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.158
Any minute now.

36:40.164 --> 36:44.101
All right, I need
the pills, okay?

36:44.368 --> 36:47.271
For my hand, for work.
To save people.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.174
Uh-huh. And you're
a real man, Tommy.

36:50.209 --> 36:52.176
You're a real hero.
Oh, yeah?

36:52.577 --> 36:54.810
Yeah!

36:54.845 --> 36:58.314
Let's go for a ride.

36:58.349 --> 37:02.787
- What are you doing?
- We'll see who's a man, pal.

37:07.792 --> 37:11.994
John Lennon, James Dean--
those guys are pretty obvious.

37:12.029 --> 37:15.633
RFK, JFK, Jimi Hendrix-- I mean, they
pretty much explain themselves, you know?

37:16.133 --> 37:18.469
Wh-What the hell
are you doin', Tommy?

37:20.037 --> 37:23.839
I want you to pull over now!
Why? God is my copilot.

37:23.874 --> 37:26.877
Well, the next best thing to God. I
want you to let that coma kid live.

37:27.878 --> 37:29.714
It's gut check time, pal.

37:38.456 --> 37:39.956
Pussy.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.858
I'll have
the Maryland crab cakes,

37:42.893 --> 37:46.397
a dozen blue point oysters,
a Caesar with no anchovies,

37:46.432 --> 37:50.366
and for entr?e,
surf and turf.

37:50.401 --> 37:52.903
The filet, medium rare, and
could I see the wine list, please?

37:55.406 --> 37:58.409
You know, I'm good with the bread, and
I'll just have a little bit more water...

37:58.444 --> 38:00.911
when you get a chance,
thank you.

38:04.415 --> 38:06.917
So I-I gotta--
I gotta tell you, you know,

38:06.952 --> 38:09.385
this is all kind of,
you know, new for me.

38:09.420 --> 38:13.424
You know? I mean, this isn't--
You know, this isn't really me.

38:13.459 --> 38:17.393
I know the feeling.

38:17.428 --> 38:22.898
And-- And you--
What about me?

38:22.933 --> 38:26.937
I don't know. I gotta be honest with
you. I kind of expected somebody...

38:26.972 --> 38:29.940
a little bit more,
you know... whorish.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.908
Don't worry.
We'll get there.

38:32.943 --> 38:37.413
No, I, um, you know,
as much as I'd like to--

38:37.448 --> 38:40.451
I really don't think I'm gonna
be needing that, uh,

38:40.486 --> 38:42.418
particular area
of your expertise.

38:42.453 --> 38:45.956
I was actually wondering, you know, if
you've ever thought about, uh, prorating.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.924
Not a chance.
Okay.

38:48.959 --> 38:51.629
So, I guess this
is a revenge thing?

38:52.129 --> 38:57.468
Uh, no, it's a fake
relationship thing.

38:57.503 --> 39:00.269
Ah. Oh.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.271
It turns her on if
you're with someone else?

39:02.306 --> 39:05.810
Yeah. That's kind
of the idea, yeah.

39:05.845 --> 39:08.277
It's pretty hot.

39:08.312 --> 39:13.818
Is she here? Uh, actually, yes.
She's, uh, across the street.

39:15.319 --> 39:19.990
Good sight line? I can
practically see her blinking.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.493
Let's hope
she doesn't blink now.

39:36.006 --> 39:38.974
Wow!

39:39.009 --> 39:41.512
Whorish enough for you?

39:42.012 --> 39:44.515
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
That was plenty whorish.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.982
Thank you.

39:47.017 --> 39:49.520
Is she waving
you over yet?

39:52.022 --> 39:54.525
Well, what do you know?

39:55.025 --> 39:58.028
I'm gonna go to the rest room.
Give you two a few minutes.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.496
Okay.
Thank you for that.

40:00.531 --> 40:04.034
You try to beat this check, I'll
hunt you down and hack your balls off.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.537
Fair enough.

40:26.557 --> 40:29.059
Listen, I gotta be quick, 'cause
she just went into the bathroom--

40:34.565 --> 40:36.066
Call me tomorrow.

40:44.909 --> 40:47.411
Ah, shit.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.888
Hey.
Hey.

40:58.923 --> 41:03.427
Is she sleeping? Mmm.
She's asking for you.

41:03.928 --> 41:07.431
Hey, how was your meeting the other
day? You haven't said anything about it.

41:07.466 --> 41:09.398
You haven't said much
of anything lately.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.435
Yeah, I'm just tired.
I don't feel like talking.

41:11.470 --> 41:13.402
Excuse me.
You know,

41:13.437 --> 41:18.407
not talking is what got you into
this mess in the first place.

41:18.442 --> 41:20.945
What do you want to hear from me,
Laura? That I can't sleep at night,

41:21.445 --> 41:23.412
that I find myself staring
in the pharmacy windows?

41:23.447 --> 41:26.749
I have visions of little white
pills dancing circles around my head?

41:26.784 --> 41:30.788
I mean, look at me, Laura, you know,
all the things that I can do at work,

41:30.823 --> 41:34.291
in the ring, in the gym, and this
tiny white pill, it's got me--

41:35.793 --> 41:40.297
What's the matter? It's just
part of the routine, baby.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.800
It comes on a couple
of times a day.

41:42.835 --> 41:46.769
Oh.

41:46.804 --> 41:49.772
I just don't
understand this, man.

41:49.807 --> 41:52.309
I don't understand how almost
losing my little girl...

41:52.810 --> 41:54.812
ain't enough
to make this go away.

41:57.314 --> 41:59.316
Daddy!

42:08.492 --> 42:10.494
Hi, Daddy.
Hey, sweetie.

42:13.497 --> 42:16.750
Shouldn't you be asleep?
Huh? Lay down.

42:16.785 --> 42:20.004
- Lay down, baby.
- Lay down with me.

42:22.506 --> 42:26.510
Daddy can't sleep
tonight, honey. Why not?

42:29.046 --> 42:32.950
I'm afraid. Lay down.
I'll keep you safe.

42:34.952 --> 42:38.320
And what's that, dear

42:38.355 --> 42:42.860
Something I don't
want to hear

42:42.895 --> 42:46.363
Bring your sister out

42:46.864 --> 42:50.868
And we'll be leavin' now

42:51.368 --> 42:55.237
And the fun stops here

42:55.272 --> 42:59.209
And it's buzzing
in my ear

42:59.244 --> 43:03.147
Bring your sister out

43:04.648 --> 43:08.652
Steak and ice cream? It's my
latest thing, "beefstachio."

43:09.153 --> 43:13.157
I called the people at Ben & Jerry's. I
gave them the recipe, but they said no.

43:13.192 --> 43:16.160
Some people have no vision.

43:16.195 --> 43:18.027
See Miami Mike?
Nah.

43:18.062 --> 43:21.482
Decided I had more important
things to do, you know?

43:21.517 --> 43:24.902
So that means you didn't
get your stash. No, I didn't.

43:24.937 --> 43:27.237
You're gonna be in
for a long night.

43:27.272 --> 43:31.206
I see it now

43:31.241 --> 43:35.245
I see it slower

43:35.280 --> 43:39.249
I see it now

44:23.861 --> 44:25.295
Cloudland.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
