Ah. Okay.

04:33.952 --> 04:34.913
Yeah.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.473
Yeah.

05:57.314 --> 05:58.274
Ray.

06:41.316 --> 06:42.917
Fucking Bible bashers.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.401
...on Radio Four.
It's at six o’clock,

09:15.481 --> 09:19.481
but from me and the entire PM team,
that's all until 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.

09:19.561 --> 09:22.320
Hope you can join us then.
Until then, have a very good evening.

09:22.401 --> 09:23.601
This is BBC Radio Four.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.321
Now at ten to six, the shipping forecast

09:25.402 --> 09:28.122
issued by the Met Office
at 1700 today.

09:28.362 --> 09:30.562
There are warnings of gales in Finisterre.

09:31.002 --> 09:34.562
The general synopsis at 1200...

10:31.643 --> 10:34.364
Dog hairs...

10:34.884 --> 10:36.044
Look at them.

11:17.165 --> 11:19.365
Where's that tea, Ray?

11:29.804 --> 11:31.005
Forgot about the tea.

11:32.165 --> 11:33.245
Still warm though.

11:40.724 --> 11:41.685
Thanks, love.

11:47.926 --> 11:49.965
Oh. It's bitter, that.

12:12.246 --> 12:14.166
Where's that brother of yours, Ray?

12:15.886 --> 12:19.447
The bells. The bells.

12:19.607 --> 12:23.806
The bells made me deaf! Water...

12:24.086 --> 12:29.407
Water... I want some water!

12:29.647 --> 12:33.767
I need a glass of water, Esmerelda!

12:34.127 --> 12:36.966
The bells made me deaf!

12:37.367 --> 12:41.527
Esmerelda, don't look at my ugly face!
The bells!

12:41.726 --> 12:45.527
The bells have made me deaf!

12:46.007 --> 12:49.326
Was that all right, Richard, eh?
Was that all right, Richard, eh? Was it?

12:50.207 --> 12:52.008
Esmerelda!

12:52.248 --> 12:55.128
- The bells have made me deaf!
- Is that me?

12:55.248 --> 12:57.287
- Esmerelda...
- Is that my voice on there?

12:57.368 --> 12:59.448
Oh, it's good what can be done
nowadays, isn't it?

12:59.528 --> 13:02.408
- They can do all sorts nowadays.
- Yes. Yes, they can.

13:04.448 --> 13:07.008
- Wow.
- Can I have some money, Nan?

13:07.128 --> 13:08.888
I've got to keep a bit for me week.

13:09.648 --> 13:12.087
- Come to Mum's. Come on.
- Don't want to.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.287
Richard, why don't you go
and do a bit of drawing?

13:14.448 --> 13:17.087
Mum says if you don't come,
you're going to get pummelled.

13:17.208 --> 13:19.208
Oh. I don't want to get pummelled.

13:19.287 --> 13:22.287
I say, I don't want to get pummelled.
No, no. Will William be there?

13:22.408 --> 13:25.249
He's at work. Mum says
there's a pork dinner you can have.

13:27.609 --> 13:30.249
Well, maybe I'll just go down quickly.

13:30.328 --> 13:31.728
See Ray, he is me brother.

13:31.849 --> 13:33.689
Well, keep that close.

13:33.808 --> 13:34.649
I will, Mother.

13:34.728 --> 13:35.569
Come on.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.889
- I'm coming.
- Hurry up.

13:37.249 --> 13:40.169
- I say goodbye, Mother. Bye.
- Bye, dear.

13:56.609 --> 13:57.609
Bye, Mother.

14:05.410 --> 14:08.850
- Come on, soft Lawrence.
- Don't call me soft!

14:33.410 --> 14:34.931
Come on, soft Lawrence!

14:36.851 --> 14:38.171
You're a little tinker, you are!

14:47.931 --> 14:49.491
Hello, Elizabeth.

14:52.611 --> 14:55.131
Shut up. Shut up, Sooty.

14:56.651 --> 14:57.931
William's not here, is he?

14:58.011 --> 14:59.891
I say, I say, William's not here,
is he?

15:02.491 --> 15:05.211
- Hello, Elizabeth.
- Will's been out all day.

15:05.810 --> 15:08.652
Are you sure Raymond, Elizabeth,
William's not here, is he?

15:08.772 --> 15:09.971
He's out for the day.

15:14.212 --> 15:15.971
Sooty, basket!

15:23.331 --> 15:25.012
When are you getting these walls papered,
Elizabeth?

15:26.012 --> 15:28.012
When we get round to it.

15:30.372 --> 15:31.412
Oh.

15:32.212 --> 15:34.212
Ah. It's a lovely photo, that.
Yes, lovely.

15:35.132 --> 15:36.892
Yes, it is a lovely photo, eh?

15:38.412 --> 15:39.731
Sit your arse down, then.

15:46.933 --> 15:48.292
It's lovely and warm in here, Elizabeth.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.092
I say, it's lovely and warm in here,
isn't it?

15:50.292 --> 15:54.373
Will you stop bloody repeating yourself?
Soon as you come in here you're doing it.

15:55.693 --> 15:57.773
- Sorry, Elizabeth.
- We're going out in a minute.

15:57.853 --> 16:01.053
- Out?
- Huh. You're staying here, mate! Huh.

16:01.693 --> 16:04.533
I want you to look after Jason.

16:06.053 --> 16:08.373
Where you going, Elizabeth?
Can't you take him with you, eh?

16:08.693 --> 16:10.493
He'll put some time into you
when he's older!

16:10.732 --> 16:12.773
You think Will's bad,
wait till he grows up!

16:13.013 --> 16:15.092
- And me!
- Oh, um,

16:15.413 --> 16:18.414
Richard says you have a pork dinner
for me. Is that right, eh?

16:19.454 --> 16:22.293
Here, look at that, mate.

16:22.494 --> 16:24.214
Yes, lovely.
Thank you, Elizabeth.

16:24.293 --> 16:26.254
Put it in the oven with a plate over it.

16:27.934 --> 16:31.854
- So, uh, where are you going to, eh?
- Will you stop fucking saying "eh"?

16:33.574 --> 16:35.813
Sorry, Elizabeth.
Where are you going?

16:36.654 --> 16:39.254
Really gets me back up, that does.

16:40.534 --> 16:44.454
I'm going to get me,
Ray and Richard some new shoes.

16:45.174 --> 16:47.534
So, now you know! Nosy fucker.

16:57.814 --> 16:59.455
Here, there's a load of drink

16:59.575 --> 17:00.974
- hidden in this house.
- No. Shut up, Ray.

17:01.055 --> 17:02.094
Woo!

17:02.734 --> 17:04.214
- Yeah.
- In this house?

17:04.415 --> 17:08.294
Oh, yeah. Vodka, brandy, you name it!
All paid for!

17:08.454 --> 17:09.895
It's hidden, and hidden good!

17:10.015 --> 17:12.214
I bought it with Ray's redundancy money

17:12.535 --> 17:14.214
and I don't want you touching
a drop of it.

17:15.094 --> 17:16.175
In fact...

17:17.494 --> 17:19.294
if you even think about looking for it...

17:19.454 --> 17:21.655
...you see this?

18:05.457 --> 18:07.897
If he starts looking for that booze,
I'll bloody kill him.

18:07.976 --> 18:10.096
Ah. He's soft, but he's not that soft.

18:52.378 --> 18:54.378
What you doing down there, Jason, eh?

18:55.218 --> 18:56.778
Hello, Jason.

19:13.139 --> 19:15.139
Oh, I do hope he doesn't cause
any trouble. I say,

19:15.459 --> 19:16.978
I do hope he doesn't cause any trouble.

19:17.738 --> 19:19.818
I hope he doesn't cause any trouble, no.

19:19.899 --> 19:21.459
I do hope
he doesn't cause any trouble, no.

19:30.098 --> 19:31.818
It's like the black hole
of Calcutta in here, Lol.

19:35.338 --> 19:38.219
What's the matter, Lol?
You look like you've seen the Gestapo.

19:39.459 --> 19:41.098
They were terrible weren't they,
the Gestapo?

19:41.179 --> 19:42.700
It was terrible what the Germans
did to the Jews,

19:42.780 --> 19:45.299
making lampshades out of skin
and putting razorblades in the soap.

19:45.660 --> 19:46.900
Razorblades?

19:47.780 --> 19:48.940
That's prison, Lol.

19:51.220 --> 19:52.780
- Where's Liz?
- They've just gone out.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.540
You've only just missed them, actually.
Um, they... they'll only be...

19:55.660 --> 19:57.660
They won't be long now.

20:04.380 --> 20:06.339
- Where've they gone?
- To the shoe shop, Elizabeth said.

20:06.420 --> 20:07.580
They all need new shoes.

20:09.180 --> 20:10.140
New shoes.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.901
Hey William, there's a load of drink
in this house.

20:20.221 --> 20:22.141
The big 'un told you that, eh?

20:22.421 --> 20:23.820
Yes. Yes.

20:24.941 --> 20:29.461
Elizabeth says if I touch any drink, then
she's going to pummel me with her fist.

20:31.340 --> 20:33.181
- Do you know what pummelled means?
- Yes.

20:41.621 --> 20:43.100
You know what happened to your mother, eh?

20:47.941 --> 20:49.221
Yeah.

21:03.422 --> 21:05.942
Where you going, William, eh?

21:47.583 --> 21:48.543
Hey.

21:54.342 --> 21:55.302
He's got gin.

21:57.063 --> 21:59.544
We've got whiskey. Vodka.

22:00.544 --> 22:02.103
Rum. Eh?

22:03.743 --> 22:04.743
Bet you'd like some of this,

22:04.823 --> 22:06.184
- wouldn't you, you cunt?
- Yes.

22:06.384 --> 22:08.983
It makes my mouth water seeing
all that drink together like that.

22:09.464 --> 22:11.424
Oh, there must be some
money's worth there.

22:12.103 --> 22:13.424
Fifty pounds worth, I'll bet!

22:23.743 --> 22:26.464
They wouldn't notice a bit going missing
from each bottle, would they?

22:28.064 --> 22:31.743
No. You know what Elizabeth's like.
She says I have to look after Jason.

22:36.265 --> 22:38.304
You know Liz has got a bit
of Nazi in her, don't you?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.984
Mm. It's where she gets that temper from.

22:41.065 --> 22:42.984
They were the worst, weren't they?
The Nazis.

22:43.705 --> 22:45.145
Killing and torturing folks.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.225
Devils, they were.

22:48.025 --> 22:50.744
Hello, Jason!
You all right, Jason? Yes.

22:52.785 --> 22:54.025
- Let's face it.
- Ah!

22:54.145 --> 22:55.785
There's no way Ray,
or Liz, for that fucking matter,

22:55.905 --> 22:57.585
knows how much is in each one
of these bottles.

22:57.945 --> 23:00.505
Would you remember how much was in here,
if this was yours?

23:00.984 --> 23:03.545
Well, no. You're right, William.
How... How could they?

23:05.225 --> 23:06.385
Put the telly on, Lol.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.546
Right-oh!

23:17.985 --> 23:19.226
No, he's all right, William.

23:20.426 --> 23:21.546
He's not gonna hurt me.

23:22.786 --> 23:24.786
Where's the on button? That's it.

23:25.666 --> 23:26.985
...it's about the press restrictions

23:27.066 --> 23:29.386
- imposed by most of the establishments.
- Technicolor, yes.

23:29.626 --> 23:31.305
We've only got a black and white one
at home.

23:31.426 --> 23:33.305
Mother won't let me have a colour set. No.

23:33.466 --> 23:35.666
- It's Air Time.
- I'd just like to say that

23:35.786 --> 23:38.745
everything the people on Air Time
said last week was rubbish.

23:38.825 --> 23:41.386
Their main argument seems to be the DJs
in Birmingham

23:41.466 --> 23:44.067
play what they want to hear
and not what the customers would like.

23:44.187 --> 23:45.907
Well, surely there must
be sufficient people

23:46.027 --> 23:48.346
who like the clubs' type of music
for them to make a profit,

23:48.427 --> 23:51.267
- otherwise they would change the style...
- What's that shit on the telly, Lol?

23:51.346 --> 23:52.306
Shit!

23:53.346 --> 23:55.027
What's that you say? Shit?

23:55.106 --> 23:58.106
- They only put shit on the telly, yes.
- Fucking telly.

24:00.467 --> 24:01.427
There you are.

24:02.106 --> 24:03.707
We're all right, aren't we?
Me and you, William, eh?

24:03.787 --> 24:04.787
Get that down you.

24:07.667 --> 24:10.667
- That's it.
- Oh, lovely. Oh, it smells like cherries.

24:14.306 --> 24:15.267
Mm.

24:16.628 --> 24:18.388
Yes, lovely. Beautiful.
Tastes like a sweet.

24:19.107 --> 24:20.428
Don't fuck about, knock it back!

24:22.148 --> 24:23.428
Here, you're not having one, William?

24:26.548 --> 24:27.508
Whoa!

24:27.588 --> 24:28.908
All in a nice row for you there.

24:28.987 --> 24:30.468
- What's this?
- It's vodka.

24:30.548 --> 24:31.987
- Vodka?
- Yeah.

24:35.468 --> 24:36.788
- Pardon me.
- Hmm.

24:38.307 --> 24:39.588
- Now you.
- Thank you.

24:46.708 --> 24:48.307
There you go.

24:48.388 --> 24:50.589
You don't think they'll notice?

24:51.149 --> 24:53.108
Don't be soft.

24:54.389 --> 24:56.108
- Do like a drop of whiskey.
- Yeah.

24:57.069 --> 24:58.108
Hmm.

25:00.229 --> 25:03.709
They do say it's the strongest
of the drinks, don't they? Whiskey.

25:04.149 --> 25:05.189
Hmm.

25:05.709 --> 25:07.869
Cherry brandy, this one. Come on.

25:08.828 --> 25:10.308
Much nicer, I think. Eh?

25:10.869 --> 25:12.108
That's it.

25:12.988 --> 25:15.949
Yes. Thank you.

25:19.748 --> 25:20.748
Mm.

25:21.149 --> 25:23.348
- Ah?
- Tastes like cherries, yes. Lovely.

25:23.709 --> 25:26.349
Hmm. Cherries, yes. Ha!

25:28.150 --> 25:29.510
- Lovely.
- Fuckin' bird.

25:35.470 --> 25:37.070
I should be more like you, William.

25:37.230 --> 25:40.270
Yes. Yes. I bet you wouldn't let the kids
round here throw bricks

25:40.349 --> 25:42.510
- at your head, would you? No.
- Throw bricks?

25:43.190 --> 25:46.390
Uh, you wanna give them some of this,
when they start.

25:46.510 --> 25:47.470
- Eh?
- Yes.

25:47.550 --> 25:48.790
- Pummel 'em.
- Pummel 'em.

25:48.870 --> 25:51.390
Yes! I will do, one day.
Just you watch, William.

25:51.510 --> 25:56.430
Why, I'm Lawrence Billingham, I am.
I'm Lawrence Billingham of Bearmore Road.

25:56.550 --> 25:58.230
Who do you think
you're messing with, eh? Ha!

25:58.309 --> 26:00.271
- Slowing down a bit, though.
- Yes. Thank you.

26:04.391 --> 26:06.310
- Sit.
- Cheers.

26:42.672 --> 26:44.272
Oh.

27:18.393 --> 27:19.713
Get them down you.

27:26.832 --> 27:28.433
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

27:28.553 --> 27:31.193
Eh, see? You can still drink,
you old fucker.

27:31.273 --> 27:33.233
Ah, yes.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.593
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

27:34.992 --> 27:35.953
Oh!

27:39.112 --> 27:40.752
Oh, thank you.

27:42.993 --> 27:44.753
- Oh, that's it.
- There you are.

27:47.554 --> 27:51.074
What does God think about all this, eh?
I say, what do you think God thinks?

27:51.714 --> 27:53.634
What do you think God thinks
about all this, eh?

27:54.353 --> 27:55.554
Say "fuck God".

27:56.914 --> 27:58.954
- What?
- Say it.

28:00.034 --> 28:01.914
No. I couldn't, William. No.

28:02.794 --> 28:05.794
No, no. 'Cause He'd never forgive me,
and I want to go to heaven when I die.

28:05.874 --> 28:06.833
Say it.

28:07.234 --> 28:09.874
- Scared to swear, are you?
- No. It's not that.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.154
Well, say it then.

28:16.114 --> 28:20.475
Fuck you, God.
And...

28:21.595 --> 28:23.754
fuck you, Elizabeth, and all.

28:23.834 --> 28:25.715
- I don't care if I do die.
- No.

28:26.595 --> 28:28.994
- No.
- Stand up.

28:29.715 --> 28:32.235
- Yeah, all right.
- Yeah, you're all right. Stand up.

30:58.799 --> 30:59.758
Now, look.

31:00.439 --> 31:01.919
That's for you. Eh?

31:02.079 --> 31:05.879
- A knife.
- Yeah, just hold it. Okay? Just hold it.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.759
A... A knife.

32:35.282 --> 32:36.242
Lawrence?

32:37.841 --> 32:38.841
Lawrence?

32:40.841 --> 32:41.802
Lawrence?

32:42.882 --> 32:43.841
Lawrence!

32:44.482 --> 32:46.361
What the bloody hell's
been going on?

32:46.761 --> 32:47.922
- Ray?
- Yes, love?

32:48.042 --> 32:51.322
Put this knife in the kitchen, will you,
before I fucking use it on him.

32:53.243 --> 32:57.723
Rich? Rich, do me a favour, love.
Take Jason upstairs, will you?

32:58.243 --> 33:00.043
Up you get.

33:05.563 --> 33:07.643
Ray?

33:16.362 --> 33:17.883
Leave him to sober up a bit.

33:21.683 --> 33:22.643
What's happening?

33:23.563 --> 33:26.884
I've just come back from market,
and Jason's running around

33:26.964 --> 33:29.924
with a fucking carving knife,
looking like a pygmy.

33:31.684 --> 33:33.123
Fuck me. Look at how much he's drunk.

33:33.244 --> 33:34.644
- I could've had that.
- Yeah?

33:34.843 --> 33:40.084
Half a bottle of brandy, a whole bottle
of whiskey and all my fucking vodka.

33:40.524 --> 33:41.843
Might be able to fix that arm.

33:43.084 --> 33:46.604
There's no way of fixing that now.
He's snapped the wood right through.

33:47.564 --> 33:48.843
Are you gonna stand for this, Liz?

33:49.244 --> 33:51.123
- I fucking ain't.
- I know.

33:51.524 --> 33:52.924
Would your mother have it? Eh?

33:53.204 --> 33:55.964
- What? No fucking way!
- Bang him one.

33:56.363 --> 33:59.245
Yeah, well he won't fucking feel it,
though, will he?

34:00.525 --> 34:01.764
Just wait till he wakes up.

34:02.405 --> 34:04.844
Well, bang him one now
for starters. Look, I'll hold his head up.

34:04.965 --> 34:06.324
He might not feel it, but...

34:07.004 --> 34:08.965
Yeah, good idea.
Put the kettle on, Ray.

34:10.565 --> 34:11.525
All right.

34:12.485 --> 34:14.205
Here, watch you don't get any sick on you.

34:14.324 --> 34:15.284
I won't.

34:19.123 --> 34:20.645
Make him clean that up, and all later.

34:21.284 --> 34:23.165
And he can buy me a new fucking settee,

34:23.245 --> 34:24.205
- as well.
- Yeah.

34:24.324 --> 34:25.284
In fact, Ray...

34:25.885 --> 34:27.925
- Yeah?
- Check his pockets, will you?

34:36.324 --> 34:39.764
- Nothing.
- I could fucking kill him.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.087
Ray's at the pub already.

35:37.527 --> 35:39.167
Right. Mind out, Jason.

35:43.968 --> 35:44.928
Here you are.

35:46.528 --> 35:47.488
Rent.

35:47.728 --> 35:51.847
- Oh. I know you always pay eventually.
- Oh, I had to look at that earlier.

35:52.767 --> 35:55.608
I think the stitching... It's getting
a bit big in the letters, like.

35:56.168 --> 35:58.608
- Here, I'll show you.
- All right.

36:01.248 --> 36:02.488
Here. You see what I mean? Look.

36:03.248 --> 36:06.608
If he was stood against a pole
or something and there was a nail, right,

36:07.168 --> 36:09.568
like that, it would catch
on the threading.

36:10.007 --> 36:11.448
- Yeah.
- You see?

36:12.088 --> 36:15.609
You see with mine, you did, look,
smaller stitching on the letters and that.

36:15.848 --> 36:17.449
- Oh.
- Yeah?

36:18.529 --> 36:20.768
- I'll double them, perhaps.
- Yeah.

36:23.089 --> 36:25.169
Hope you bloody wear this one, Rich.

36:26.689 --> 36:28.008
Is he staying there all night?

36:29.489 --> 36:31.089
Not for much longer, don't worry.

36:32.768 --> 36:34.929
- Runners then.
- See you, Will.

37:05.009 --> 37:06.329
Get out the way, you two.

37:06.610 --> 37:08.810
- What are you going to do?
- Watch out, Rich.

37:27.251 --> 37:30.931
Drunken... fucking... bastard.

37:31.731 --> 37:34.491
Huh? Oh, awake now, are we?

37:35.091 --> 37:39.731
I come back here to find that you've drunk
half our spirits...

37:41.691 --> 37:48.010
...and Jason's covered in boot polish
and he's holding a fucking carving knife!

37:48.531 --> 37:51.531
You will never step foot
in this house again!

37:52.130 --> 37:54.251
- Why can't he feel it?
- He will.

37:55.770 --> 37:58.371
Here, see if you feel this.

38:36.973 --> 38:38.693
Now get out of my house.

39:03.413 --> 39:06.213
Make sure he's gone, Rich.

39:39.814 --> 39:41.935
You ready to take Jason up in a minute?

39:47.055 --> 39:48.935
Water!

39:49.175 --> 39:52.935
Hello, Jason! Hello, Jason!
Yes. Hello, Jason.

39:53.415 --> 39:54.535
Let's face it.

39:54.854 --> 39:56.575
There's no way Ray,
or Liz, for that fucking matter,

39:56.655 --> 39:58.295
knows how much is in each one
of these bottles.

39:58.815 --> 40:01.095
Would you remember how much was in here,
if this was yours?

40:01.854 --> 40:03.535
Well, no.
You're right William.

40:03.655 --> 40:04.655
How... How could they?

40:04.735 --> 40:06.215
We're all right aren't we,
me and you, William? Eh?

40:06.295 --> 40:07.295
Get that down you.

40:07.374 --> 40:08.495
Oh, thank you.

40:10.815 --> 40:12.735
Yes. Lovely.
Beautiful, tastes like a sweet.

40:13.215 --> 40:14.735
Don't fuck about, knock it back!

40:15.135 --> 40:16.296
Hmm!

40:17.616 --> 40:18.976
All in a nice row for you there.

40:19.056 --> 40:20.015
What's this?

40:21.056 --> 40:22.015
But that's mine.

40:22.096 --> 40:24.256
I'll give you another one
to play with tomorrow.

40:25.736 --> 40:26.775
Go on to bed, you two!

40:30.736 --> 40:31.696
I said bed.

40:52.376 --> 40:54.297
Yes. Lovely.
Beautiful, tastes like a sweet.

40:54.657 --> 40:56.217
Don't fuck about, knock it back.

40:56.336 --> 40:58.776
They wouldn't notice a bit going missing
from each bottle, would they?

41:00.297 --> 41:01.376
Oh, no.

41:01.497 --> 41:03.897
You know what Elizabeth's like.
She says I have to look after Jason.

41:04.257 --> 41:06.417
You know
Liz's got a bit of Nazi in her, don't you?

41:07.217 --> 41:09.097
Yeah. It's where she gets
that temper from.

42:17.619 --> 42:21.299
Oi! Oi! Up here!

42:22.739 --> 42:25.018
I'll be over Thursday morning, Ray.

42:27.299 --> 42:30.499
- What about later?
- I'm going the doctors.

42:30.819 --> 42:33.740
- Doctors?
- Yeah. Me back's playing up again.

42:34.900 --> 42:38.540
- What about after?
- I said Thursday morning, Ray.

42:39.980 --> 42:41.060
What day is it?

42:41.300 --> 42:43.460
- Tuesday!
- Okay.

43:33.581 --> 43:37.661
- Fucking flies.
- Oh!

43:38.941 --> 43:40.982
Ah, I didn't know
you were there.

43:45.462 --> 43:46.902
Must be a nest of them in here.

43:55.462 --> 43:56.542
I remember once...

43:58.422 --> 43:59.422
down the old house...

44:00.582 --> 44:01.582
going back ages.

44:02.582 --> 44:06.381
There was a fly’s nest down the back
of the sofa. This is nothing.

44:11.982 --> 44:13.381
Wouldn't like them in my flat.

44:22.103 --> 44:25.183
I bet they're fruit flies.
It'll be the beer.

44:26.823 --> 44:28.463
They're after the carbon dioxide.

44:29.903 --> 44:31.063
They're nothing like these fuckers.

44:33.022 --> 44:33.983
Anyway...

44:36.263 --> 44:38.423
Spiders, I don't like.

44:40.103 --> 44:42.503
Jason put one in a matchbox once
when he was little.

44:43.903 --> 44:47.583
I opened the box to light a fag,
nearly jumped out of me skin.

44:54.264 --> 44:56.464
You can do without that for a minute,
can't you?

44:58.584 --> 44:59.544
Oh.

45:26.344 --> 45:27.505
Well, everything's gotta live.

45:28.425 --> 45:29.784
Except the blacks, of course.

45:33.344 --> 45:35.625
- If the CSA is unable...
- Anyway,

45:36.505 --> 45:37.784
you'll have money this week.

45:38.265 --> 45:41.065
- Yeah.
- Paid the water. Your electric.

45:41.384 --> 45:45.905
And the community charge or the poll tax
or whatever the fuck they want to call it.

45:46.665 --> 45:48.225
- Twelve pound eighty left.
- Uh.

45:50.105 --> 45:51.505
Don't spend it all at once.

45:52.305 --> 45:55.625
Don't...
spend it all at once!

45:55.864 --> 45:58.066
Oh.

46:02.025 --> 46:03.266
I could go out on that.

46:03.946 --> 46:05.426
Give it to the big 'un, more like.

46:07.586 --> 46:09.946
No. She might have a shock this time.

46:11.106 --> 46:14.666
Why should I keep giving her all my money,
in the hope she'll come back?

46:15.066 --> 46:16.546
You do it every week, Ray.

46:16.946 --> 46:18.826
Well, I'm not gonna keep bastard doing it.

46:21.345 --> 46:22.506
Sod her this time.

46:24.865 --> 46:28.466
I don't know why she left though.
Sod... Sod me, I don't.

46:29.426 --> 46:32.307
You've done nothing but moan ever since
I've known you.

46:32.427 --> 46:34.427
Always saying that you want to live
on your own.

46:34.507 --> 46:36.427
Wonder what her flat's like over there.

46:37.427 --> 46:39.987
I bet it's all been decorated
by the council.

46:41.667 --> 46:42.627
Hmm.

46:52.667 --> 46:53.587
That's it.

47:00.707 --> 47:02.227
I can't hate her for it, see.

47:03.227 --> 47:05.747
- I can't hate her.
- Look at you, you little bugger.

47:06.748 --> 47:07.908
Look at you.

47:11.147 --> 47:14.387
Go on. Out you go.

47:14.828 --> 47:18.228
They've been fucking about down there
for three fucking months.

47:18.468 --> 47:23.347
Useless bastards. And everywhere
there's piles of fucking dirt and mud.

47:25.468 --> 47:26.308
Ah.

47:29.468 --> 47:31.108
When I look at Jason up there...

47:32.988 --> 47:35.027
I keep thinking
that's what he looks like now.

47:35.387 --> 47:36.948
You know, three or a four-year-old.

47:37.908 --> 47:43.429
But that picture was taken years...
Bastard years ago. Yeah.

53:48.919 --> 53:50.798
Oi! Bastard!

54:48.160 --> 54:50.601
- What you doing?
- Go and see what that is.

56:31.403 --> 56:32.363
Jason.

56:34.764 --> 56:35.724
Jason.

58:28.847 --> 58:31.968
- Get fucking off!
- Oh, God. Bastard!

58:32.128 --> 58:34.208
What the fuck are you hitting me for?
Fuck off!

58:34.768 --> 58:38.288
Out! Fuck off, out.

59:18.689 --> 59:19.649
Ray...

59:21.168 --> 59:23.489
- Ray?
- My bastard mouth's burning here.

59:23.769 --> 59:26.368
- Well, put the kettle on, will you?
- I’ll have a cup too.

59:26.449 --> 59:28.408
- No school today, Rich?
- No.

59:28.529 --> 59:30.689
- It's a study period.
- Study period!

59:47.409 --> 59:50.169
- How did you do on the maths test?
- I got a hundred.

59:50.330 --> 59:53.169
Oh, I only got ten,
and I still cheated.

59:53.290 --> 59:55.210
You're not gonna get very far then.

59:55.450 --> 59:57.450
- Not the consequences.
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:04.530 --> 01:00:05.730
See ya.

01:00:11.169 --> 01:00:12.090
Hey, Jay.

01:00:12.369 --> 01:00:15.011
We're having a bonfire at mine tonight,
you should come.

01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.451
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:17.651
See you tonight!

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:31.293
Come on, chap. There you go.

01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.215
On the side.

01:02:49.535 --> 01:02:50.455
On the side.

01:02:50.535 --> 01:02:52.255
...so I stopped
having them since last year.

01:02:52.335 --> 01:02:54.095
I told them to piss off.
I scared them.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:56.735
Gypsy Rose on the side.

01:02:57.015 --> 01:02:59.615
Hold on the side,
Gypsy Rose. We hear you, love.

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:02.495
Did you hear about the couple
who won the pools?

01:03:02.575 --> 01:03:04.255
Nearly half a million. Over.

01:03:04.935 --> 01:03:06.496
I heard something about it

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.976
- up in Sunderland or Newcastle way...
- The pools,

01:03:09.136 --> 01:03:10.175
- that's what we...
- Shh.

01:03:10.415 --> 01:03:11.656
...over.

01:03:12.736 --> 01:03:14.976
Six months
and they'd blown the blinking lot. Over.

01:03:15.256 --> 01:03:16.696
Like my redundancy money.

01:03:16.815 --> 01:03:18.976
Half a million quid
in six months?

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:21.136
- Huh?
- That's disgusting...

01:03:21.296 --> 01:03:22.936
That's why we're living like this now.

01:03:24.895 --> 01:03:27.415
What on earth
would they have spent that on? Over.

01:03:27.496 --> 01:03:29.136
God knows.

01:03:29.976 --> 01:03:30.815
Kevin?

01:03:30.895 --> 01:03:33.415
You know what they say,
money don't buy you happiness. Over.

01:03:33.536 --> 01:03:35.895
- Told you.
- You got a spare ciggy, Liz?

01:03:35.976 --> 01:03:38.496
I tell you what, mate,
half a million would make me happy. Over.

01:03:38.576 --> 01:03:39.737
Just what's in the jar.

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:43.297
Oh, fuck it,
it'd make me happy and all. Over.

01:03:44.857 --> 01:03:45.857
Here you are.

01:03:48.097 --> 01:03:49.577
I went up there
last year.

01:03:49.857 --> 01:03:51.257
It rained right. Don't bother. Over.

01:03:51.416 --> 01:03:52.416
Fuck me.

01:03:53.977 --> 01:03:54.857
Do you know anyone going...

01:03:54.937 --> 01:03:57.176
- Cor, look at that one.
- Yeah, I know.

01:03:57.337 --> 01:03:59.657
There's an inch of white left
on some of them.

01:04:04.697 --> 01:04:06.737
You found all of these
under the subway?

01:04:08.056 --> 01:04:09.217
Yep.

01:04:09.896 --> 01:04:12.056
Can't believe what some people chuck away
these days.

01:04:12.857 --> 01:04:13.698
Oh.

01:04:14.098 --> 01:04:16.177
I'm gonna have
to put the heating on again. Over.

01:04:17.177 --> 01:04:20.177
Oh, it's not January
yet, is it? Over.

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:22.458
On the side, love.

01:04:25.018 --> 01:04:26.218
Give us a bit of your home brew.

01:04:28.658 --> 01:04:29.978
I haven't got much left.

01:04:31.778 --> 01:04:32.897
Here... Give it here.

01:04:33.057 --> 01:04:35.338
What couldn't you do
with that, eh?

01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:16.420
We weren't the only ones
who thought Isaac was weird.

01:06:17.221 --> 01:06:19.420
One day Joseph told us
he was running away.

01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:23.141
That he couldn't take it anymore.
He was pretty scared.

01:06:38.421 --> 01:06:40.022
Good day at school, Jay?

01:06:40.821 --> 01:06:41.782
Yep.

01:07:04.943 --> 01:07:07.503
Anybody'd think they didn't feed you
at school.

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:09.943
Ravenous.

01:07:10.663 --> 01:07:12.703
Just like the dog.

01:08:25.944 --> 01:08:27.465
Bloody hell!

01:08:27.705 --> 01:08:30.785
Yeah, I told you
the power would go out tonight, didn't I?

01:08:33.305 --> 01:08:35.625
Have you got any change left
for the meter?

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:38.665
No. Not if you want me
to phone Boris after.

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:41.184
That bastard!

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:44.305
Phone him instead, get some money off him.

01:08:49.786 --> 01:08:51.026
I'm off down Lol's now.

01:08:51.946 --> 01:08:53.385
Will I see you tomorrow?

01:08:53.904 --> 01:08:55.145
Yeah, probably.

01:11:07.950 --> 01:11:11.350
- Hello?
- Hi, hello. It's Elizabeth calling.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:14.790
Oh. Not you again. He's not here.

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:16.670
Oh, oh.

01:11:17.470 --> 01:11:21.150
- When will he be back, love?
- I've no idea. But I've told you before,

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:23.710
I don't know anything
about your money or your problems.

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:25.990
You always phone up when you're broke,
don't you?

01:11:26.429 --> 01:11:29.470
All I know is I need to get
the kids bathed and into bed.

01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:30.790
Oh.

01:11:31.230 --> 01:11:35.310
- Uh, sorry. I... I... I just wondered if...
- I just told you,

01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:39.231
I don't know. Now stop bothering me
or I'll call the police.

01:12:39.712 --> 01:12:40.872
What did Boris say then?

01:12:41.672 --> 01:12:42.792
He wasn't in.

01:12:44.112 --> 01:12:45.272
He's never in.

01:12:45.712 --> 01:12:47.191
That's what she says, anyway.

01:12:48.033 --> 01:12:49.513
I'll try him again tomorrow.

01:12:51.713 --> 01:12:53.072
Did you ask her about the money?

01:12:54.153 --> 01:12:55.713
She doesn't have anything to do
with it.

01:12:55.832 --> 01:12:58.392
She must know something.
She's his... She's his wife.

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:02.473
Well, why don't you go
and bastard phone then?

01:13:03.353 --> 01:13:04.192
Eh?

01:13:05.353 --> 01:13:06.192
No.

01:13:06.912 --> 01:13:09.553
You don't know
how to use a bloody phone, do you?

01:13:53.594 --> 01:13:54.994
- Let me tell it.
- Go on then.

01:13:55.114 --> 01:14:00.475
There was this guy, he was like,
he used to dig up people from the graves.

01:14:01.355 --> 01:14:03.955
One day his foot got chopped off.

01:14:04.394 --> 01:14:07.595
Then his foot ran away
and started kicking people.

01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:09.074
- Yeah.
- Seriously?

01:14:12.955 --> 01:14:14.074
Do you want some toast, Jay?

01:14:53.636 --> 01:14:55.676
Yay!

01:15:52.878 --> 01:15:54.837
Cahill, bath, pyjamas, bed.

01:15:55.798 --> 01:15:56.878
Cahill, come on.

01:16:08.118 --> 01:16:09.197
Look, come here.

01:16:09.798 --> 01:16:10.958
Time for bed.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:14.398
Cheers, then.

01:16:35.599 --> 01:16:37.838
See you, Jay, watch how you go.

01:16:38.519 --> 01:16:39.639
Okay.

01:20:02.125 --> 01:20:03.365
Thanks, love.

01:21:27.488 --> 01:21:30.808
- Can you hear us?
- Stand up, stand up.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:36.008
- Oh gosh, he's so cold.
- Okay, mate.

01:21:36.248 --> 01:21:38.888
- He's freezing.
- Get him warm, get him warm.

01:21:39.008 --> 01:21:39.927
Are you okay?

01:21:41.568 --> 01:21:43.328
Can you hear us?
Mate, are you all right?

01:21:50.407 --> 01:21:51.407
He's freezing.

01:21:51.688 --> 01:21:53.168
Can you hear us?

01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:56.689
- Hey. He was at our bonfire last night.
- Do you know him?

01:21:56.809 --> 01:21:58.249
- He was in the shed all night.
- In there?

01:21:58.329 --> 01:22:00.609
- Yeah. He's... He's freezing.
- Yeah. Stone cold.

01:22:00.689 --> 01:22:02.249
Pass him. Pass him...
Pass him over here.

01:22:02.928 --> 01:22:04.729
- Come.
- Okay.

01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:07.848
- Oh.
- You okay?

01:22:08.088 --> 01:22:11.889
Oh. Oh, oh, I've got you.
I've got you.

01:22:12.569 --> 01:22:13.609
Okay.

01:22:20.609 --> 01:22:23.448
Tony, Salah,
get down here now!

01:22:24.969 --> 01:22:27.169
Okay, little boy, sit you on here.

01:22:33.730 --> 01:22:35.370
Turn that kettle off, somebody!

01:22:51.130 --> 01:22:54.330
Okay... Oh, God.

01:22:56.089 --> 01:22:57.810
Oh, God.

01:22:59.089 --> 01:23:00.970
I'll be all right in a minute.

01:23:09.971 --> 01:23:11.011
You're okay.

01:23:13.011 --> 01:23:17.491
Okay... Oh... God.

01:23:25.930 --> 01:23:27.691
Come on, let's warm you up.

01:23:37.131 --> 01:23:38.091
Okay.

01:23:41.972 --> 01:23:43.172
You are okay.

01:23:58.892 --> 01:24:00.052
Oh, thanks, Tony.

01:24:11.931 --> 01:24:14.452
Why didn't you tell me
you were still out there last night?

01:24:15.533 --> 01:24:16.693
Thought you went home, Jay.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:21.013
- I forgot my way home.
- Can Jason stay tonight?

01:24:22.173 --> 01:24:25.533
Of course...
As long as he asks his mother first.

01:24:27.932 --> 01:24:29.773
And you don't have to sleep
in no shed this time.

01:24:31.253 --> 01:24:35.173
- You'll share Tony's room. Right, Tony?
- Yeah, Jay.

01:24:43.573 --> 01:24:44.613
Yeah...

01:24:48.453 --> 01:24:51.894
...what are the best?
Toast with butter on. Amazing.

01:24:52.093 --> 01:24:53.334
Yeah, it tastes good.

01:24:53.694 --> 01:24:56.334
- It's freezing, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's freezing.

01:24:57.014 --> 01:25:00.134
- My mum said it was gonna snow.
- Snow? Blooming heck.

01:25:00.894 --> 01:25:02.494
- Y... You wait there, okay?
- Okay.

01:26:00.935 --> 01:26:02.935
- Did you ask her?
- Yeah, it's all fine.

01:26:03.056 --> 01:26:04.336
- Sure?
- Don't worry.

01:26:04.496 --> 01:26:05.455
Great.

01:26:55.577 --> 01:26:58.617
See, you've got him. Keep going.

01:26:58.977 --> 01:27:00.416
That way. That way.

01:27:00.577 --> 01:27:03.857
- Oh, that's defeated me. Great.
- Try again.

01:27:08.937 --> 01:27:11.738
- You can keep it if you want, Jay.
- Seriously?

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:13.578
Yeah, we got Pong anyway.

01:27:15.298 --> 01:27:17.298
Bed!

01:27:17.738 --> 01:27:19.258
Lights out, now.

01:27:27.857 --> 01:27:29.417
Bed time, boys!

01:27:44.858 --> 01:27:46.938
- That was really fun, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

01:27:47.739 --> 01:27:49.858
- Do you wanna play it tomorrow?
- Yeah.

01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:15.740
You're not gonna get me.
You're not gonna get me.

01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.300
There he is. New clothes?

01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:26.020
- Where have you been?
- Just staying at a friend's house.

01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:28.580
Huh? Coppers have been out
looking for you.

01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.859
- The police?
- Aye.

01:28:30.219 --> 01:28:32.419
I've got a chicken dinner
being cooked for me, I'll be back after.

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:35.300
Well, make sure you do.
You've school tomorrow.

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.459
Okay.

01:28:37.099 --> 01:28:38.780
No. Put that up a bit.

01:28:43.859 --> 01:28:45.300
Got you. You're it.

01:28:51.741 --> 01:28:53.381
Anyway, tag.

01:29:22.262 --> 01:29:24.221
Do you realise you could have frozen
to death?

01:29:25.742 --> 01:29:27.342
Sleeping rough all night in a shed?

01:29:29.382 --> 01:29:30.342
Weren't you scared?

01:29:33.702 --> 01:29:35.782
What have you got to say for yourself, eh?

01:29:45.382 --> 01:29:48.421
When you leave school today,
I'm gonna take you to a new home.

01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:50.822
A home with foster parents,
who are gonna look after you.

01:29:51.582 --> 01:29:53.262
They're gonna give you nice clean clothes.

01:29:53.622 --> 01:29:55.503
You're gonna get all your meals
that you need,

01:29:55.663 --> 01:29:58.102
and they're gonna make sure
you can come to school on time.

01:29:58.503 --> 01:30:01.183
It's only temporary.
How do you feel about that?

01:30:01.543 --> 01:30:03.743
- Yeah, it's all fine.
- Good.

01:30:36.824 --> 01:30:39.463
We can’t have children
Jason's age sleeping rough.

01:30:40.463 --> 01:30:42.824
He's only a short bus ride away,
up at Cherry Orchard.

01:30:44.223 --> 01:30:46.984
Just make sure you phone Jan and Dave,
his foster parents, first.

01:30:47.423 --> 01:30:48.624
Just to make sure they're in.

01:30:51.223 --> 01:30:52.784
I thought you'd come
to get us some more money.

01:30:53.664 --> 01:30:55.423
I've looked at your benefits,
and at the moment,

01:30:55.504 --> 01:30:58.344
you're getting the correct amount of money
for the number of dependents you've got.

01:30:58.463 --> 01:31:02.223
But when Jason leaves, you'll lose
25 pound a week.

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:03.745
Cor!

01:31:18.944 --> 01:31:20.505
I suppose
you heard all that, then?

01:31:20.705 --> 01:31:22.985
Could... Can I be put up
with foster parents too?

01:31:23.065 --> 01:31:25.625
No, it's Jason we're
most concerned with at the moment, so...

01:31:25.864 --> 01:31:28.424
You're nearly an adult,
you'll be getting out of here soon,

01:31:28.505 --> 01:31:30.985
so you focus on that. Okay?

01:31:32.505 --> 01:31:33.385
Bye.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.067
What about all those kids
on the telly...

01:32:18.027 --> 01:32:20.147
from Ethiopia with nothing to eat?

01:32:24.027 --> 01:32:25.347
Pass me a fag, Ray.

01:32:32.866 --> 01:32:34.226
Thanks, love.

01:33:42.789 --> 01:33:47.069
Pissed again?
You drunken, fucking bastard!

01:33:47.948 --> 01:33:50.389
Go on. Up on your feet, if you can.

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:26.469
You're gonna kill yourself
if you keep this up.

01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:27.750
You know that, don't you, Ray?

01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:31.950
It's half nine in the morning
and you're fucking pissed already.

01:34:42.591 --> 01:34:47.110
It's your fault I'm like this... Drinking
to excess. I never used to do it.

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:53.831
Anyway... I might not be in that flat
for much longer.

01:34:54.071 --> 01:34:56.751
- Eh?
- If I can't pay the bills.

01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:59.031
Gas is being cut off next week.

01:34:59.711 --> 01:35:01.751
- Where will they put you?
- Fuck knows.

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:06.111
How much do you need?
I don't need money anyway.

01:35:06.672 --> 01:35:10.471
Because you don't eat anything.
You never go outside this block.

01:35:10.832 --> 01:35:13.231
In fact, you don't even go
outside this room.

01:35:13.352 --> 01:35:15.072
I'm surprised you even go to the toilet.

01:35:18.512 --> 01:35:20.111
What sort of a life's that, Ray?

01:35:20.992 --> 01:35:25.072
As long as Sid... cashes my dole
down that post office,

01:35:25.592 --> 01:35:28.912
pays my bills and brings me
this strong home brew,

01:35:29.272 --> 01:35:32.632
I'm happy as... a pig in shit.

01:35:35.951 --> 01:35:39.033
Oh yeah, I've got more than 12 quid
in my pocket.

01:35:39.193 --> 01:35:42.753
Twelve quid more than what you've got,
I'll bet! Not that much of a fool!

01:35:43.153 --> 01:35:44.593
Lend me some money, then, Ray.

01:35:56.593 --> 01:35:59.872
I'm asking you a fucking question,
bollock brain!

01:36:02.913 --> 01:36:05.713
Here... Have the bloody money!

01:36:07.593 --> 01:36:10.273
I don't need it... not really.

01:40:39.043 --> 01:40:44.043
