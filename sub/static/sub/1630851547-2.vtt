10:10.218 --> 10:11.436
Now the two of you
are gonna get out.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.699
Slowly.

10:12.742 --> 10:13.961
SHAMMY:
Yeah,

10:14.004 --> 10:15.484
that's gonna be a problem
for me.

10:16.790 --> 10:19.096
Really? Why's that?

10:19.140 --> 10:20.707
Because I'm disabled,

10:20.750 --> 10:22.970
and I don't have
my chair with me.

10:26.756 --> 10:28.671
All right, you.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.368
Carry him out of his seat.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.369
Look, I'm not doing

10:31.413 --> 10:32.675
all of that, man.[grunts]

10:32.719 --> 10:34.808
Hey, easy!

10:40.291 --> 10:42.076
Right there by the log.

10:42.119 --> 10:44.818
Set him down,
then don't move.

10:46.950 --> 10:48.909
Stay on channel 12.

10:48.952 --> 10:51.563
I'll radio you
when I reach the bag.

10:51.607 --> 10:53.304
[grunts softly]

10:54.392 --> 10:55.785
TC:
You good, buddy?Yeah.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.744
Thoughts?

10:58.788 --> 10:59.920
Could be fugitives.

10:59.963 --> 11:01.748
Molokai's not a bad place

11:01.791 --> 11:03.097
to disappear for a while.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.622
Wouldn't bode well for us.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.103
There's no reason to keep us
alive in a scenario like that.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.191
I don't think
there's any scenario

11:10.234 --> 11:11.322
where this ends well for us.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.934
Which means at some point,

11:13.977 --> 11:15.109
we're gonna have
to get out of this jam

11:15.152 --> 11:16.240
ourselves.

11:16.284 --> 11:17.851
For now...

11:18.982 --> 11:20.114
...let's just go along
with whatever

11:20.157 --> 11:21.463
they ask.All right.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.943
Good.
Try not to goon it up.

11:25.641 --> 11:26.729
All right.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.818
My friend and I need to recover

11:28.862 --> 11:31.299
something on this island,
so here's what's gonna happen.

11:31.342 --> 11:34.084
Big guy comes with
me. Everyone else

11:34.128 --> 11:35.825
stays behind. Got it?

11:35.869 --> 11:37.348
Let's just get this over with.

11:37.392 --> 11:40.787
Agreed.
This should go without saying,

11:40.830 --> 11:43.833
but try anything,
and I radio my partner here

11:43.877 --> 11:45.661
to put a bullet
in your friend's head.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.971
Let's go.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.025
I got your text.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.288
What's the big emergency?

12:04.332 --> 12:05.986
Try this.

12:06.029 --> 12:08.075
[exhales]

12:11.513 --> 12:12.470
Mmm.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.037
That's pretty good.

12:14.081 --> 12:16.170
[sighs]
God, it's worse than I thought.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.520
Sorry, should I have been
more effusive?

12:18.563 --> 12:21.523
Because
it's actually quite nice."Quite nice"

12:21.566 --> 12:22.829
isn't gonna cut it, Kumu.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.352
You remember when Suzy

12:24.395 --> 12:25.788
came up with
those weekly cocktail specials

12:25.832 --> 12:27.268
and I let her run with it

12:27.311 --> 12:28.791
because I thought
I was being a good manager

12:28.835 --> 12:30.575
and I didn't want to discourage
an employee

12:30.619 --> 12:31.707
that was showing
a little initiative?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.143
Remember that?I also recall

12:33.187 --> 12:34.841
that those drinks
started selling like crazy

12:34.884 --> 12:36.320
and filling up this bar
every night.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.974
Yeah. But the problem is

12:38.018 --> 12:40.237
the customers
expect new drinks every week,

12:40.281 --> 12:42.413
and with Suzy gone,
it's on me to come up with them.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.024
Good thing you're a bartender.Yeah,

12:44.067 --> 12:46.722
I'm a bartender,
but Suzy, she's a mixologist.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.376
Know what? Scratch
that. She...

12:48.419 --> 12:51.161
She's an artist. I mean,

12:51.205 --> 12:53.598
she could take pisco,
rosemary, star fruit,

12:53.642 --> 12:55.818
and combine it
to make something so delicious,

12:55.862 --> 12:58.603
I wouldn't feel bad
about charging 16 bucks a pop

12:58.647 --> 12:59.996
for it.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.737
Now, I was thinking,
since you're an expert

13:01.781 --> 13:03.913
on island culture,
maybe you could

13:03.957 --> 13:05.480
help me come up
with some unique takes

13:05.523 --> 13:07.351
on traditional tiki drinks.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.223
You know, like a mai tai
or a Blue Hawaiian.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.878
Only fancier and more expensive.

13:11.921 --> 13:15.490
[chuckles softly] Oh, Rick,
I'm always happy to help.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.754
What are you doing?Texting my nephew

13:18.798 --> 13:20.190
to pick up my Vespa.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.366
Because if things go
how I think,

13:22.410 --> 13:25.587
no way I'll be
in any condition to drive.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.632
Oh, speaking of which,
you'll be covering my Uber home.

13:27.676 --> 13:30.548
Gladly. Let's get started.Okay.

13:30.592 --> 13:32.463
IOHA:
Look,

13:32.507 --> 13:34.335
it's a construction site.

13:34.378 --> 13:36.554
We got materials coming in,
machinery getting moved around.

13:36.598 --> 13:38.730
It's inevitable we're gonna
have security cameras go down.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.645
Not to mention, unless
something's stolen

13:40.689 --> 13:42.778
or there's an accident,
no one's checking them.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.259
So it can be days before
we know there's a problem.

13:45.302 --> 13:48.131
Okay, but you can understand
how it looks to our client.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.090
Her husband dies,

13:50.133 --> 13:52.744
and conveniently, the
security cameras are broken?

13:52.788 --> 13:55.182
I get it. Poor woman's grieving.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.053
God knows
I've been there myself.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.446
But the truth is

13:58.489 --> 14:00.230
despite all the precautions
we take,

14:00.274 --> 14:02.102
this can be
a dangerous line of work.

14:02.145 --> 14:04.234
And people get careless.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.932
They make mistakes.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.934
Are you suggesting
it was Makoa's fault?

14:07.977 --> 14:11.241
No. I'm not saying that at all.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.113
HIGGINS:
Mr. Ioha,

14:13.156 --> 14:14.854
is there something else
you'd like to tell us?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.640
Here's the thing. O-Okay.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.381
The day after the accident,

14:20.424 --> 14:22.644
we got the results back
from a random drug test

14:22.687 --> 14:25.038
we gave the crew
earlier in the week.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.737
Makoa tested positive
for opiates.

14:29.781 --> 14:32.697
If I'd even gotten the
results back a day sooner,

14:32.741 --> 14:34.743
I would've had to fire him then,

14:34.786 --> 14:37.137
and he'd still be alive.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.270
Did he strike you as somebody
with a substance abuse problem?

14:40.314 --> 14:42.925
Honestly, I didn't spend
much time with him.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.840
I hired Makoa through a program

14:44.884 --> 14:46.929
that gets work for ex-cons.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.888
Since the state gives
me a tax incentive

14:48.931 --> 14:51.020
for hiring through the
program, it's a win-win.

14:52.065 --> 14:54.676
You didn't know he had a record?HIGGINS:
No.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.460
We didn't.

14:56.504 --> 14:58.810
As far as you know, did
Makoa have any issues

14:58.854 --> 15:00.334
with anyone on
his work crew?

15:00.377 --> 15:02.292
No.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.816
Despite whatever trouble he had
in his past, he was a good guy.

15:04.860 --> 15:07.297
Well, we appreciate
your time.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.212
Thanks for the help.Thanks.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.345
Sounds like
our client's husband

15:11.388 --> 15:13.216
wasn't the saint
she believed him to be.

15:17.394 --> 15:19.440
[GPS beeping]

15:22.051 --> 15:24.184
This thing we're
looking for,

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
it's drugs, right?

15:26.055 --> 15:28.362
Why would you assume that?

15:28.405 --> 15:31.365
Molokai's on the
flight path into Oahu.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.410
So if a couple of
drug traffickers

15:33.454 --> 15:36.587
were forced to dump their
cargo prior to landing,

15:36.631 --> 15:39.112
this would be the
natural place to do it.

15:39.155 --> 15:42.637
And I heard you tell your
partner not to goon it up.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.247
That's Air Force slang.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.728
So I'm guessing you
two served together.

15:46.771 --> 15:48.251
He's the pilot.

15:48.295 --> 15:51.037
Which makes you, what?
Brains of the operations?

15:51.080 --> 15:53.691
[chuckles]
What branch were you in?

15:53.735 --> 15:56.607
Marines. Two tours.

15:57.652 --> 16:00.176
Guess I have to keep
an extra close eye on you.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.178
Actually, I think I'm done

16:02.222 --> 16:03.397
helping you out.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.138
Well, in that case...

16:06.095 --> 16:07.923
I should just
kill you now.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.229
Go right ahead.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.057
Who's gonna fly you
off this rock?

16:11.100 --> 16:13.102
You're right.

16:13.146 --> 16:16.062
We need you alive.

16:16.105 --> 16:19.282
But we certainly don't need
your crippled friend.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.807
So, what's it gonna be?

16:26.724 --> 16:28.770
Should be
up ahead here somewhere.

16:30.815 --> 16:31.991
Over there.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.564
RANDALL:
Son of a bitch.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.308
SHAMMY:
This gonna take

16:45.352 --> 16:48.007
much longer? 'Cause if we don't
get back for our next tour,

16:48.050 --> 16:50.618
people are gonna start looking
for us.Relax.

16:50.661 --> 16:52.098
My partner will be back soon.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.621
Is he your partner?

16:53.664 --> 16:55.275
'Cause the way
he talked down to you,

16:55.318 --> 16:57.016
he sounded more like your boss.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.670
Keep running your mouth.
See how that works out for you.

17:00.802 --> 17:02.282
RANDALL:
We got a problem.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.413
What's going on?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.111
The drugs are gone.

17:05.154 --> 17:07.678
What? How is that even possible?

17:07.722 --> 17:09.158
Oh, I'll tell you how.

17:09.202 --> 17:12.422
Only two people knew
we were gonna ditch them.

17:12.466 --> 17:13.728
The same guys who warned us

17:13.771 --> 17:15.643
the DEA was waiting
at the airstrip.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.471
The buyers.RANDALL:
Exactly.

17:17.514 --> 17:19.125
Lucky for us,

17:19.168 --> 17:20.169
there's fresh footprints.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.258
Oh, so they're still

17:22.302 --> 17:23.781
on the island?RANDALL:
If they are,

17:23.825 --> 17:25.087
I intend to find them.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.523
And Mr. Marine here

17:26.567 --> 17:28.003
is gonna

17:28.047 --> 17:29.744
help me kill those bastards.

17:34.183 --> 17:35.706
KATSUMOTO:
All right. Here's what we have

17:35.750 --> 17:37.012
on Makoa Brown.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.319
Multiple arrests
dating back to 2012.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.668
According to the gang unit,

17:40.711 --> 17:42.322
he was associated
with the Sons of Tonga.

17:42.365 --> 17:44.846
All the charges were
for nonviolent offenses

17:44.889 --> 17:46.152
except for the last one
three years ago.

17:46.195 --> 17:47.283
And what was he
charged for then?

17:47.327 --> 17:48.545
Murder.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.506
Oh, yeah.
I remember this case.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.855
Makoa killed somebody?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.684
Allegedly.

17:56.727 --> 17:58.338
Victim was a Michael Aquino.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.253
Eyewitness put Makoa
at the scene.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.863
That got HPD a warrant

18:01.906 --> 18:04.039
to search his property,
where they found a 9mm

18:04.083 --> 18:05.823
that was a ballistics match.

18:05.867 --> 18:09.044
So, how did Makoa end up skating
on a murder charge?

18:09.088 --> 18:11.481
Someone messed up chain
of custody on the nine-mil.

18:11.525 --> 18:12.787
Judge tossed it.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.399
There were also inconsistencies
in the witness's statement,

18:16.443 --> 18:18.358
so the P.A.
felt the case was a loser.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.142
Dropped the charges.

18:20.186 --> 18:21.709
I'll tell you this much, though.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.580
Prevailing opinion at the time

18:23.624 --> 18:25.539
was that through nothing
but sheer luck,

18:25.582 --> 18:27.671
Makoa managed to get away
with murder.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.891
Well, if we're looking
for motive,

18:29.934 --> 18:31.414
I think we just found it.

18:31.458 --> 18:35.070
Yeah. Sounds like our
client might be right.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.551
Makoa's death
was no accident.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.863
It says here the witness
changed her statement

18:45.907 --> 18:48.214
as to which direction Makoa
fled after the shooting.

18:48.257 --> 18:50.085
Yeah. It seems minor,
but a good defense lawyer

18:50.129 --> 18:52.392
can use stuff like that
to plant doubt in a jury's mind.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.915
HIGGINS:
Mm.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.743
What's going on here?Hey.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.788
KATSUMOTO:
Oh, the usual. Magnum's

18:57.832 --> 18:59.094
just making our office
his home.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.443
[chuckles]

19:00.487 --> 19:01.923
Uh, Detective Kaleo,
I don't think you've met

19:01.966 --> 19:03.098
my partner, Juliet Higgins.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.447
Juliet Higgins,

19:04.491 --> 19:05.927
Detective Kaleo.It's a pleasure to meet you.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.015
Same.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.104
So, what are we looking at?

19:09.148 --> 19:11.106
You remember
the, uh, Michael Aquino murder

19:11.150 --> 19:13.064
from a few years back?Sure.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.936
Suspect walked.
Looked good for it, too.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.938
Yeah, Makoa Brown.
So happens

19:16.981 --> 19:18.635
he just died in a
construction accident last week.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.943
The wife hired Magnum and
Higgins here to look into it.

Well, here's something
you should know.

19:23.292 --> 19:24.946
Aquino's father,

19:24.989 --> 19:27.427
Hector, kind of lost it
when Makoa wasn't charged.

19:27.470 --> 19:30.169
There were a lot of angry calls
to the P.A.'s office.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.432
He started harassing
Makoa, too.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.130
Showing up outside his house.
Went on for months.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.958
Makoa had to get
a restraining order.

19:37.001 --> 19:38.568
If he was willing
to stalk Makoa,

19:38.612 --> 19:41.136
maybe he was willing
to take it a step further.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.964
Enough to make you wonder
if he has an alibi

19:43.007 --> 19:44.313
for the time of Makoa's death.

19:44.357 --> 19:45.880
Unfortunately,

19:45.923 --> 19:47.838
I can't just ask him myself.LIA:
He's right.

19:47.882 --> 19:50.450
If we get involved,
it looks like we're undermining

19:50.493 --> 19:53.017

Makoa's death an accident.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.976
But you two should
definitely look into this.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.108
Oh, yeah, we intend to.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.371
Uh, thanks so much

19:58.414 --> 19:59.459
It was a pleasure

19:59.502 --> 20:00.895

20:02.331 --> 20:03.767
Thinking before we
go see Mr. Aquino,

20:03.811 --> 20:05.465

update our client.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.118
I'm not looking forward
to that conversation.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.730
We promised Alani answers.
I'm just not sure

20:09.773 --> 20:11.166

20:12.080 --> 20:14.822
No, I don't believe it.

20:14.865 --> 20:18.173
Makoa wasn't capable
of something like that.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.915
Did Makoa tell you he had been
a member of a street gang?

20:22.917 --> 20:25.528
Makoa was open about his past,

20:25.572 --> 20:27.878
but I never pressed him
for details.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.751
That's probably
why he never told me

20:30.794 --> 20:32.405
about this murder charge.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.365
Uh, Alani,

20:36.409 --> 20:39.238
we found out that Makoa
tested positive for drugs.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.590
The test was administered
just a week before the accident.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.332
That's not possible.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.291
Look, I don't know
what's going on here,

20:49.335 --> 20:51.337
but my husband was a good man.

20:51.380 --> 20:54.731
I'm sorry for not telling you
about his record.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.691
I was just so desperate
for help,

20:57.734 --> 21:00.215
and I didn't want you
judging him for his past

21:00.259 --> 21:01.303
like everyone else did.

21:01.347 --> 21:04.263
We understand that. That's why

21:04.306 --> 21:06.874

investigating this case.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.357
'Cause I still can't shake
the feeling

21:11.400 --> 21:14.360

to hurt Makoa,

21:14.403 --> 21:16.362

What about Makoa Brown?

21:35.468 --> 21:37.208
You ever think about him?

21:39.820 --> 21:42.518
I heard what happened
to Makoa.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.956
Suppose you're gonna tell us
you're sad to hear he's dead?

21:48.959 --> 21:52.049
Do you know how many nights
I laid awake

21:52.093 --> 21:53.790
wishing death upon that man?

21:53.834 --> 21:56.924
I had so much hate in my heart.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.056
Not just for Makoa.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.929
For the prosecuting attorney
who wouldn't do his job.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.061
For that witness who,
for some reason,

22:04.105 --> 22:05.889
couldn't stick to her story.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.588
But eventually, I realized

22:08.631 --> 22:10.285
the hate was consuming me.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.505
And after a lot of hard work,

22:25.605 --> 22:28.608

Look, you're investigating
Makoa's death.

22:34.962 --> 22:37.007
I get why you'd suspect me.

22:37.051 --> 22:40.054
But the God's honest truth
is I didn't kill him.

22:41.011 --> 22:42.186

especially the part

22:47.801 --> 22:49.803

22:49.846 --> 22:51.979
I can't imagine what it's like
to lose a child.

22:52.022 --> 22:54.416
I know it's not something you
just decide to get over one day.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.984
Exactly. And you heard what
Lia said. Up until recently,

22:57.027 --> 22:59.552
this guy was, like,
full-on stalking Makoa.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.857
"Lia"?

23:00.901 --> 23:02.511
Detective Kaleo.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.688
My point is that the
timing of Hector's trip

23:05.732 --> 23:07.473
just seems too convenient,
like he was trying

23:07.516 --> 23:08.691
to buy himself an alibi.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.345
Well, in which case,

23:10.389 --> 23:12.782
he would've had to enlist
somebody to kill Makoa.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.262
Which makes sense.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.307
It's not that easy

23:17.744 --> 23:19.049
the construction company
was using ex-cons.

23:19.093 --> 23:21.965
Maybe Hector enlisted
one of these ex-cons

23:22.009 --> 23:24.185

look like an accident.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.062
there weren't any drugs in

about the positive drug test.

29:41.649 --> 29:44.217
for both Hector Aquino
and Makoa's boss, Ronald Ioha.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.872
And this is where it gets
interesting. They both made

29:46.915 --> 29:49.048
semiregular calls
to the same number.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.832
It's a local
grief counseling group.

29:50.876 --> 29:54.096
Can't be a coincidence.No. Hard to imagine it is.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.924
Hey, when we were talking
to him this morning,

29:55.968 --> 29:57.534
didn't he mention something

29:57.578 --> 29:59.449
about knowing what it's like
to grieve someone?

29:59.493 --> 30:01.060
He did.

30:01.103 --> 30:03.584
Do me favor. Pull up
the obituaries page

30:03.627 --> 30:04.803
for the Star-Advertiser

30:04.846 --> 30:06.369
and run the name Ioha,

30:06.413 --> 30:08.241
see what comes up.Right.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.720
Okay, here it is.

30:09.764 --> 30:12.462
Ellen Ioha.
Passed away last year.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.074
"Loving wife of Ronald Ioha."

30:15.117 --> 30:17.076
Does it say how she died?

30:17.119 --> 30:21.036
HIGGINS:
Ron Ioha's wife was killed
in a car accident last year.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.908
And here's
where it gets interesting.

30:22.951 --> 30:25.084
The drunk driver
responsible for her death

30:25.127 --> 30:27.956
only served four months
for vehicular manslaughter,

30:28.000 --> 30:30.741
and he recently died
under suspicious circumstances.

30:30.785 --> 30:35.050
LIA:
So, Ioha and Aquino attend
the same grief counseling group,

30:35.094 --> 30:36.965
and the people
both men blame

30:37.009 --> 30:38.227
for the death of
their family members

30:38.271 --> 30:39.925
have recently
turned up dead?

30:39.968 --> 30:42.753
Exactly. A-Aquino has an alibi
for Makoa's death, right?

30:42.797 --> 30:46.235
But Ioha, Makoa's boss,
he was there when Makoa died.

30:46.279 --> 30:47.758
In fact, he went

30:47.802 --> 30:50.065
out of his way to hire Makoa,
and he also lied

30:50.109 --> 30:51.893
about employing people
from a job placement program

30:51.937 --> 30:53.286
to make it seem like

30:53.329 --> 30:55.201
hiring ex-cons
was commonplace for him.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.724
KATSUMOTO:
Unbelievable.

30:56.767 --> 30:59.031
Ioha kills Makoa for Aquino,
and in return,

30:59.074 --> 31:00.902
Aquino gets rid
of the drunk driver

31:00.946 --> 31:02.164
that's responsible for the death

31:02.208 --> 31:03.818
of Ioha's wife.HIGGINS:
I reckon

31:03.862 --> 31:05.951
if you bring in Hector Aquino
for questioning,

31:05.994 --> 31:08.823
he won't have an alibi
for the drunk driver's death.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.651
KATSUMOTO:
I suspect you're right.

31:10.694 --> 31:12.566
We'll pick up
both Aquino and Ioha.

31:13.654 --> 31:15.351
Okay, Higgins and I
have a stop to make,

31:15.395 --> 31:17.136
but we'll get to the station
as soon as we can.

31:17.179 --> 31:18.659
KATSUMOTO:
All right.

31:19.573 --> 31:21.096
What's going on?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.619
Hector Aquino was so convinced

31:22.663 --> 31:24.578
that Makoa killed his son,
right?

31:24.621 --> 31:26.623
But Alani was right
about the accident

31:26.667 --> 31:28.538
being staged.
Maybe she was right

31:28.582 --> 31:30.801
about Makoa, too.
Maybe Makoa didn't kill

31:30.845 --> 31:32.499
Michael Aquino.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.850
DONNE:
I'm sorry, but it's three years
since I gave my statement.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.373
I'm not sure
how helpful I'm gonna be.

31:37.417 --> 31:40.986
Ms. Chan, you witnessed
somebody get killed.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.988
I would think
something like that stays

31:43.031 --> 31:45.686
in your memory.Look, I told the police
everything I knew.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.122
That case is closed.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.385
Yes, Donne, that
case is closed.

31:49.429 --> 31:52.736
But the man that you ID'd
as a shooter is now dead.[sighs]

31:52.780 --> 31:55.000
Wait.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.915
Makoa Brown is dead?

31:56.958 --> 31:58.307
MAGNUM:
Yeah.

31:58.351 --> 32:00.179
And we believe it was over

32:00.222 --> 32:01.789
the alleged murder
of Michael Aquino.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.187
Donne,

32:08.230 --> 32:11.625
did Makoa actually shoot
Michael Aquino?

32:20.416 --> 32:22.853
TC:
Starting to think the
guys that ripped you off

32:22.897 --> 32:24.420
might be long gone.

32:24.464 --> 32:26.118
You're just here 'cause
you can fly a chopper.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.336
Leave the rest to me.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.859
Mm-hmm.

32:28.903 --> 32:31.471
[indistinct chatter in distance]

32:38.086 --> 32:40.393
[chatter continues]

32:46.442 --> 32:48.053
You were saying?

32:48.096 --> 32:49.924
That your buyers?

32:49.968 --> 32:51.839
So what's your plan?

32:53.014 --> 32:54.320
RANDALL:
Give me a minute.

32:54.363 --> 32:55.625
TC:
Could probably get the jump

32:55.669 --> 32:56.844
on one of them.

32:56.887 --> 32:59.107
Chances are other guy

32:59.151 --> 33:00.456
would get to his gun
before you dropped him.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.762
I said I'm thinking.
Shut up.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.764
Better think fast,
'cause they're

33:03.807 --> 33:06.114
about to leave.I said shut your...
[grunts]

33:06.158 --> 33:07.159
[gunshot][TC yells]

33:12.077 --> 33:13.513
MAN:
Let's go!

33:38.668 --> 33:40.931
[panting]

33:49.636 --> 33:50.811
[groans]

33:53.031 --> 33:54.728
[groans]

34:04.564 --> 34:05.826
[grunting]

34:18.795 --> 34:20.058
Ah!

34:32.896 --> 34:34.594
[TC grunting loudly]

34:37.640 --> 34:39.120
[gunshot][TC grunts]

34:51.176 --> 34:52.699
[static crackles]

34:52.742 --> 34:55.267
Mayday! Mayday!

34:55.310 --> 34:57.269
This is Theodore Calvin

34:57.312 --> 34:59.706
with Island Hoppers
chopper tours of Oahu.

34:59.749 --> 35:00.707
I'm in immediate need

35:00.750 --> 35:02.056
of medical attention.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.710
Mayday!

35:03.753 --> 35:05.581
This is Theodore Calvin. Calvin.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.235
Please! Mayday!

35:07.279 --> 35:09.585
I'm on the eastern side
of Molokai.

35:09.629 --> 35:13.372
One klick from Kawakiu Beach.

35:16.026 --> 35:19.160
[wheezing]

35:19.204 --> 35:20.901
[exhales]

35:21.858 --> 35:23.469
[helicopter blades whirring]

35:23.512 --> 35:25.079
[static crackles]

35:25.123 --> 35:27.516
SHAMMY:
We see you, buddy. Hang on.

35:37.657 --> 35:39.876
MAN:
We got you, TC.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.052
You're safe now, buddy.

35:55.153 --> 35:57.938
KATSUMOTO:
They say conspiracy cases
are hard to prove,

35:57.981 --> 35:59.461
but that hasn't been
my experience.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.811
When you're counting
on two people to keep a secret,

36:01.855 --> 36:05.815
one person will inevitably break
and give the other one up.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.252
Especially when you know

36:07.295 --> 36:08.992
how to apply
the right kind of pressure.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.779
You told the investigators
who came to see you today

36:12.822 --> 36:16.261
that you have a history
of hiring ex-cons.

36:16.304 --> 36:19.002
Why would you lie
about that, Mr. Ioha?

36:19.046 --> 36:20.613
I didn't.

36:20.656 --> 36:21.788
They must be mistaken.

36:21.831 --> 36:23.790
No, I don't believe
they are.

36:23.833 --> 36:25.444
In fact,
I think if we start looking,

36:25.487 --> 36:27.663
we'll find you lied
about all kinds of things.

36:27.707 --> 36:29.622
Like those
security cameras.

36:29.665 --> 36:32.146
Did they really get knocked out
accidentally,

36:32.190 --> 36:34.192
or did you disconnect them
before pushing

36:34.235 --> 36:35.454
Makoa Brown to his death?

36:35.497 --> 36:37.282
I told you.

36:37.325 --> 36:40.676
I didn't kill Makoa.I think

36:40.720 --> 36:41.764
you did.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.331
And in return for doing that,

36:43.375 --> 36:45.420
Hector Aquino
agreed to kill the drunk driver

36:45.464 --> 36:47.205
who was responsible
for your wife's death.

36:48.249 --> 36:51.252
Only question now
is which one of you

36:51.296 --> 36:52.906
is gonna blink first?

36:55.300 --> 36:58.607
KATSUMOTO:
You did a decent job of covering
up the drunk driver's death.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.741
Shot him in the back
of the head. Took his wallet.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.265
But can you trust

37:04.309 --> 37:05.919
that Ron Ioha

37:05.962 --> 37:08.226
was as careful as you were
when he killed Makoa?

37:09.227 --> 37:10.663
[knock on door]

37:12.926 --> 37:14.971
[door opens]

37:16.625 --> 37:18.192
We just came
from seeing Donne Chan,

37:18.236 --> 37:19.498
the witness that ID'd

37:19.541 --> 37:21.195
Makoa
for Michael Aquino's murder.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.849
What did she have to say?

37:22.892 --> 37:24.111
[door opens]

37:24.154 --> 37:25.678
Mr. Aquino.

37:25.721 --> 37:28.942
Yeah.You remember Mr. Magnum,
Ms. Higgins.

37:28.985 --> 37:32.293
We thought you'd want to know
we just talked to Donne Chan,

37:32.337 --> 37:33.381
and she admitted

37:33.425 --> 37:34.991
to lying to the police.

37:35.035 --> 37:37.559
Makoa Brown
didn't kill your son.

37:38.604 --> 37:40.910
No, no, no.
That-That-That's not possible.

37:40.954 --> 37:43.348
HIGGINS:
The gang that Makoa
had been a member of

37:43.391 --> 37:45.045
killed Michael over a drug deal.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.526
They then planted
the murder weapon

37:47.569 --> 37:50.311
in Makoa's car
and threatened Donne

37:50.355 --> 37:52.748
unless she agreed to ID him
as the shooter.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.621
[quietly]:
No.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.063
Ron Ioha just confessed.
Admitted he killed Makoa

38:03.106 --> 38:05.283
in exchange for Mr. Aquino here

38:05.326 --> 38:07.894
taking care of the drunk driver
who killed his wife.

38:07.937 --> 38:09.852
Should've talked
when you had the chance.

38:09.896 --> 38:12.464
Now you get to go to prison
for a very long time.

38:13.508 --> 38:15.510
[exhales]

38:29.394 --> 38:31.309
So?

38:31.352 --> 38:34.094
Well, it's very... long.

38:34.137 --> 38:35.878
All right, I might have
gotten a little carried away,

38:35.922 --> 38:37.837
but it took me a while
just to work through

38:37.880 --> 38:39.317
what it is I was feeling.

38:39.360 --> 38:41.231
I can see that.[sighs]Really?

38:41.275 --> 38:43.669
'Cause I still have no idea
what it is I'm trying to say.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.933
Well, sure. There are
a lot of scattered thoughts

38:46.976 --> 38:48.935
here, but that's
just because you're conflicted.

38:48.978 --> 38:51.416
On the one hand,
you want Suzy to know

38:51.459 --> 38:53.461
that you genuinely care
about her

38:53.505 --> 38:55.855
and that you want to explore
a relationship.

38:57.030 --> 38:58.814
But you also don't want
to burden her with all that

38:58.858 --> 39:01.774
when she needs to be focused
on the amazing work opportunity

39:01.817 --> 39:03.776
she has.Yes, that's exactly right.

39:03.819 --> 39:06.256
Well, then,
maybe the best course of action

39:06.300 --> 39:08.302
would be to give Suzy some space

39:08.346 --> 39:09.956
to go on that journey

39:09.999 --> 39:13.438
and trust that if you guys
are truly meant to be together,

39:13.481 --> 39:15.353
it will ultimately
work itself out.

39:15.396 --> 39:19.574
So, what you're saying
is don't send the text.

39:19.618 --> 39:21.924
Yes.
But that was never the point.

39:21.968 --> 39:24.057
[exhales]
Okay.

39:24.100 --> 39:27.277
I get it now.
You made me go through all that

39:27.321 --> 39:28.975
just so I could
figure out what it is

39:29.018 --> 39:31.456
I'm feeling. Like therapy.

39:31.499 --> 39:32.979
Only cheaper.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.807
And with booze.[chuckles]:
Oh, well,

39:34.850 --> 39:37.636
I will say cheers to that,
young lady.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.028
In fact, I think
you earned yourself

39:39.072 --> 39:41.030
another one on the house, huh?Oh.

39:41.074 --> 39:42.815
Better make it water.Oh, you're tapping out?

39:42.858 --> 39:44.512
No shame in that.[chuckles softly]

39:44.556 --> 39:46.862
Oh! Oh, my God, Rick,

39:46.906 --> 39:48.647
I-I'm so sorry.
I must have pressed a button.What? What? No. No, no, no!

39:48.690 --> 39:50.344
Tell me you didn't send
that text, Kumu.Oh, God.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.650
No! Oh, my God, Kumu.[camera clicks]

39:51.693 --> 39:53.042
Really?You should see

39:53.086 --> 39:55.697
your face. So worth it.

39:56.611 --> 39:59.005
You enjoy being cruel,
don't you?A little bit.

39:59.048 --> 40:00.398
You're really good at it.[phone rings]

40:03.444 --> 40:05.446
Shammy. What's up?

40:07.448 --> 40:09.407
Wait, what?

40:12.366 --> 40:15.674
Hey. Rick sends his love.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.502
Magnum, too.

40:17.545 --> 40:18.851
They're gonna let, uh, Higgins
and Kumu know what happened.

40:18.894 --> 40:20.243
[exhales]

40:20.287 --> 40:21.854
What happened
is you saved my life.

40:21.897 --> 40:24.596
Coast Guard saved your life.

40:24.639 --> 40:27.207
At best, I get the assist.Don't minimize,

40:27.250 --> 40:28.600
dude.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.515
That was one hell
of a first solo flight.

40:30.558 --> 40:33.126
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

40:33.169 --> 40:34.823
Seems all I had to do

40:34.867 --> 40:36.825
to stop worrying about
my impending death

40:36.869 --> 40:38.436
was to start worrying

40:38.479 --> 40:39.785
about yours.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.700
Well, here's to hoping
that the next one

40:41.743 --> 40:43.484
goes a little easier.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.228
Seriously, Sham. Thank you.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.886
[door opens]HIGGINS:
I see you're back

40:53.929 --> 40:55.061
to leaving your door unlocked. [door closes]

40:55.104 --> 40:56.715
Ooh, you look nice.

40:56.758 --> 40:58.499
Thanks.

40:58.543 --> 41:01.546
Yeah, uh, gonna drop by
and check in on TC,

41:01.589 --> 41:04.026
and then I'll probably meet
a friend for a drink.

41:04.070 --> 41:06.768
Hmm. Yeah, I just, uh,
spoke to Theodore, actually.

41:06.812 --> 41:10.685
Sounds like he and Shammy
had quite the ordeal.

41:10.729 --> 41:12.078
I was actually gonna

41:12.121 --> 41:13.558
bring them some coffee
and malasadas

41:13.601 --> 41:15.603
first thing in the morning.

41:15.647 --> 41:17.126
You okay?

41:18.127 --> 41:19.868
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.436
It's just jet lag, I guess.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.568
You sure?

41:23.611 --> 41:25.352
Because, you know,

41:25.395 --> 41:27.659
couple days ago, you were
on the other side of the planet

41:27.702 --> 41:30.618
with Ethan, and now
you're thousands of miles away,

41:30.662 --> 41:32.925
many time zones apart.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.492
Can't be easy.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.798
No. But...

41:36.842 --> 41:41.194
Hey, at least one of us gets
to have a love life these days.

41:42.543 --> 41:44.545
I'm sorry, is Ethan...

41:44.589 --> 41:46.286
seeing somebody else?

41:46.329 --> 41:48.288
I'm talking about you, you prat.

41:48.331 --> 41:51.160
Oh, you really didn't think
I was gonna figure it out?

41:51.204 --> 41:54.424
You're locking your door.
Your tidiness.

41:54.468 --> 41:56.949
Your sudden interest
in home fragrances?

41:56.992 --> 41:58.603
You have a girlfriend.

41:58.646 --> 42:00.953
No, you know what?
You really do need some sleep,

42:00.996 --> 42:02.824
because you are
clearly losing it.Fair enough.

42:02.868 --> 42:06.088
Yeah. Do me a favor and say hi
to Lia when you see her later.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.481
Oh.

42:07.525 --> 42:09.483
Sorry. Detective Kaleo.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.224
[chuckles]

42:11.267 --> 42:13.443
Okay. You got me.

42:13.487 --> 42:14.793
But if it makes
any difference,

42:14.836 --> 42:16.490
it wasn't my idea
to keep it a secret.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.013
Lia just thinks
that, you know,

42:18.057 --> 42:21.321
given our connection
to Gordie and HPD, it's...

42:21.364 --> 42:22.583
probably better to be discreet.

42:22.627 --> 42:24.629
Yeah, no, I don't blame her.

42:24.672 --> 42:26.631
[chuckles softly]

42:26.674 --> 42:27.893
["Home Again"
by Michael Kiwanuka playing]

42:27.936 --> 42:30.069
Happy for you, Thomas.

42:30.112 --> 42:31.984
Don't muck this up.

42:34.682 --> 42:36.162
What're you doing?

42:36.205 --> 42:38.294
Just hold still.You know, I can dress myself.

42:38.338 --> 42:39.644
Been doing it since I was three.

42:39.687 --> 42:42.690
Yeah, well, I would
rethink that button.

42:42.734 --> 42:44.692
You're showing a little too
much sternum. Rick might think

42:44.736 --> 42:45.998
you're stealing his look.
