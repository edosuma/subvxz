I have no idea
how you're pulling this off,
but I swear to God,

00:06.465 --> 00:08.592
I'm not gonna stop
until I figure it out,
you understand me?

00:08.676 --> 00:09.665
I'm just trying
to figure out

00:09.760 --> 00:10.840
how to take care
of our family.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.919
I don't have a job, Jan.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.678
They're gonna pay for
what they did to me,

00:17.768 --> 00:19.019
what they did to us.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.386
There is no putting this
whole thing behind you.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.732
We've got to find out
what they did
and make them fix it.

00:23.816 --> 00:25.932
You wanted to know
why I was invisible
all these years?

00:26.027 --> 00:27.107
It was because of them.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.645
And you've brought
the bastards
right to my door.

00:30.990 --> 00:34.107
Tell me, Claire,
can you keep a secret?

00:34.911 --> 00:37.152
I think I know how
I survived that fire.

00:41.083 --> 00:42.914
Please say something.

00:47.506 --> 00:50.794
Some family.
That's how I survived it.

DR. LINDALE: Your mother
has a subdural hemorrhage.

00:53.471 --> 00:55.632
It's like a bruise
on her brain,

00:55.723 --> 00:57.714
specifically the area
that controls memory.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.469
You erased her mind.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.175
Claire, that's ridiculous.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.806
You tried to erase mine.

01:02.897 --> 01:04.307
What you know
is dangerous.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.650
Why did you do this to Mom?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.476
I only wanted to
protect my family.

Mr. Muggles, would I?

01:56.575 --> 01:58.907
You know what?
If you want to hurt this guy,
that'd be the way to do it.

01:58.995 --> 02:02.453
There are more pictures
of dogs around here
than there are of his kids.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.951
You don't really think
that he's stupid

02:05.042 --> 02:07.909
and/or sloppy enough to
leave incriminating evidence
around the house?

02:08.004 --> 02:09.619
I mean, he did just get
raided by the FBI.

02:09.714 --> 02:11.875
We couldn't get a warrant
for the house,

02:13.301 --> 02:17.135
so in the off chance that he
is a little sloppy or stupid,
I'm gonna poke around.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.336
So now we're jacking
his computer?

02:18.431 --> 02:21.173
You want to sit around all day
and download files? I don't.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.178
If we don't find
anything on his PC,

02:23.269 --> 02:25.510
there is somewhere else
we can look.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.855
Inside his head!

02:26.939 --> 02:30.477
I plan on that. We're gonna
bag this smug son of a bitch

bag him here.

Oh, God, he's with his family.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.413

a pretty good motivator.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.001

that was Plan A.
Plan B is much better.

02:52.048 --> 02:54.414
There is no Plan B.
We leave now.

How many times are you
gonna let this guy
slip through your fingers?

03:17.531 --> 03:19.112
Lyle, help your mother.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.161
Claire, talk to me.

03:27.166 --> 03:28.781
What's the point?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.995
Am I even going to
remember this conversation?

03:31.087 --> 03:32.702
Would you keep
your voice down?

get out of the house,
right now!

a lot of questions.

What do you want from me?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.328
You come into my house
with guns?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.327
Not guns, gun.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.329

No.

04:40.364 --> 04:41.729
You're not.

04:48.998 --> 04:52.206

how do you feel

and family are concerned,
it's your life.

Congratulations, you are
the new regional manager
for Primatech Paper.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.465
Nice cover.

05:05.556 --> 05:09.469
Sorry to make a liar
out of you, but it's part
and parcel of what we do.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.642
Nobody outside
the organization knows.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.219
Well, they can't know.

05:13.314 --> 05:15.896

05:16.150 --> 05:18.857

the world is changing,

05:18.944 --> 05:21.151
and they simply don't
want to deal with it.

05:21.238 --> 05:23.650
They don't want to know
what's happening to us
as a species.

05:23.741 --> 05:27.825
And they certainly don't
want to know the measures
we take to keep them safe.

05:27.912 --> 05:32.326
Now, you'll be asked to
do things that fall in
the morally gray territory.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.782
Things that most
would find cruel,

05:34.877 --> 05:38.085

know to be necessary.

of yours, Mr. Bennet?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.962
He drugs us.

06:27.221 --> 06:29.963
He injects us with

06:31.183 --> 06:32.514

06:32.601 --> 06:35.092

not to lose my wife.

06:35.271 --> 06:36.431
But you don't care
about that, do you?

06:36.522 --> 06:37.887
You don't care about
what you did to me.

is that we think that
nothing happened.

make you forget?

talking about, Claire?

13:48.370 --> 13:50.076
And with his
own gun, too.

13:52.541 --> 13:53.872
Kind of poetic,
don't you think?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.824
Tell him what
he wants to know!

13:55.919 --> 13:57.659
Come on! He's willing
to kill us all.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.415
Leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.495
Claire, sit down.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.171
Shoot me, if you're
gonna shoot someone.

14:02.259 --> 14:03.294
No!

14:05.137 --> 14:07.719
MR. BENNE T: Parkman,
you have to trust me.
Shoot Claire.

14:07.806 --> 14:09.671
TED: I'm telling you,
someone's gonna die.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.347
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bennet.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.426
Shoot Claire now.
She can heal.

14:14.604 --> 14:15.855
Shoot me!

14:15.939 --> 14:17.179
You brought this
on yourself.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.309
No!

14:23.613 --> 14:26.446
No, no, no, Claire.
Claire!

14:27.534 --> 14:29.070
What did you do?

14:36.293 --> 14:38.454
No, no, no, Claire.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.994
What did you do?

14:41.923 --> 14:43.504
What did you do that for?

14:45.761 --> 14:47.297
MR. BENNET: Get his trust.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.298
Now he knows
how far we'll go.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.630
Right hook.
Right hook coming.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.891
Bastard!
You killed my little girl!

14:55.729 --> 14:57.185
You, you did!

14:58.065 --> 14:59.555
No!

15:05.363 --> 15:07.319
Tell me it's not true.

15:09.785 --> 15:10.865
Tell me...

15:10.952 --> 15:12.078
Don't leave her here!

15:12.162 --> 15:14.153
Move Claire’s body
before she heals.

15:15.499 --> 15:16.864
They don't need
to see here like this.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.289
We've got to move the body.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.119
I had no idea it was
going to go this far.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.079
Believe me, he was
going to kill your wife.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.880
I actually heard him pull
the trigger in his mind.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.468
Thank you
for shooting first.

15:31.389 --> 15:33.095
(COUGHING)

15:39.272 --> 15:40.261
(GASPS)

15:44.027 --> 15:45.187
Oh, my God.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.312
Where's Mom and Lyle?
Downstairs.

15:49.407 --> 15:50.442
Are they safe?
No.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.865
Wait, you made her
indestructible?

15:51.952 --> 15:54.944
I didn't make anyone.
You don't have all
your facts straight,

15:55.038 --> 15:57.700
and I don't appreciate
your confusing my daughter.

15:57.791 --> 16:00.954
The facts are you work
at some freak factory
where you ruin people's lives.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.376
You've been misled, Claire.
I will explain
everything later,

16:03.463 --> 16:06.079
but right now,
you have to do exactly
what I tell you to do.

16:06.174 --> 16:07.129
I'm going to the police.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.377
No, no, wait, wait.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.675
Do not make
the same mistake I did.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.048
Don't put your family at risk.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.011
Parkman?

16:22.357 --> 16:23.563
Yeah, coming!

16:26.153 --> 16:28.485
The people I work for
don't know about you.

16:28.572 --> 16:31.029
If they did, you wouldn't
be here right now.

16:31.116 --> 16:32.526
They would have
taken you months ago,

16:32.617 --> 16:34.699
and we never would
have seen you again.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.660
You say you want
a normal life,

16:37.747 --> 16:39.453
that's what I've
been fighting for.

16:41.626 --> 16:42.957
He's telling the truth.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.796
Hate me all you want,
but right now,

16:47.883 --> 16:52.252
this has to be contained,
which means
you have to stay put.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.505
What?
You want me to play dead?

16:53.597 --> 16:55.087
I'm sorry,
I'm not Mr. Muggles.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.138
That man downstairs can
generate a chain reaction,

16:57.225 --> 16:59.841
which would be like dropping
a nuclear bomb on this house.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.392
And he'll do it, too.
Come on, we got to go now.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.970
Right. Just do what I say,
so nobody gets hurt. And you.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.020
Yeah?

17:05.108 --> 17:06.348
Do what I think.

17:16.870 --> 17:17.859
(GRUNTS)

17:17.954 --> 17:19.205
MATT: Hey! Hey, enough!

17:19.289 --> 17:20.324
SANDRA: God!

17:20.415 --> 17:23.282
No! Enough!
We already got
their attention.

17:26.254 --> 17:27.460
We're not gonna
find anything here.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.878
What we want is at
the paper factory.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.125
Really?
Yeah.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.633
He tell you that,
or think it?

17:34.095 --> 17:36.677
They've got records
of the abductions,
what they've done.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.973
In exchange for
his family's safety,
he'll get them for us.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.391
I don't want
anybody else to die

17:41.478 --> 17:42.593
because of what
I've done to you.

17:42.687 --> 17:45.064
Why do all words
coming out of your mouth
sound like lies?

17:45.148 --> 17:46.763
He's not lying.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.651
We'll have proof.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.360
No surprises at the factory?

17:52.447 --> 17:53.527
Just the truth.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.981
I'll stay with the family.
You go.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.565
No.

17:58.870 --> 18:00.280
I'll stay with the family.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.828
I can do more damage here.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.872
Whatever you say.
You're in control.

18:05.543 --> 18:06.669
Sandra...

18:08.713 --> 18:10.749
I'm gonna get us
out of this.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.343
All right, it's 7:00 am.
If you're not back in an hour,

18:17.305 --> 18:19.466
look for the mushroom cloud.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.429
MR. BENNET: I think my wife
suspects something.

18:27.524 --> 18:30.982
She went through my bag.
She found a gun
and a sedation kit.

18:32.070 --> 18:35.528
That's a particular kind
of stupid on your part,
letting her find them.

18:35.615 --> 18:39.574
I know. The baby's been
keeping me up for days.
It was sloppy.

18:39.661 --> 18:42.243
I think Sandra thinks
I'm some sort of
a serial killer.

18:42.330 --> 18:46.448
She's better off thinking
you're a serial killer
than knowing the truth.

18:46.543 --> 18:47.623
I don't know what to do.

18:52.549 --> 18:54.039
Is my wife in danger?

18:55.385 --> 18:58.047
If I said yes,
what would be
your next move?

18:58.138 --> 19:00.595
Would you pack up
Sandra and little Claire
and make a run for it?

19:00.682 --> 19:02.923
Or would you turn her over?

19:03.852 --> 19:06.889
I'd do what
I've always done,
what I'm told.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.597
But you didn't
answer the question.
Is she in danger?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.484
Relax. Nothing's gonna
happen to your wife,

19:14.571 --> 19:17.859
because she's not gonna
remember finding anything.

19:18.199 --> 19:20.485
There's a boy
we discovered in Haiti.

19:20.577 --> 19:21.692
He can make her forget?

19:21.786 --> 19:24.163
He's really something.
He's mute.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.827
When we asked him to
describe his ability,
he drew a picture of himself

19:28.918 --> 19:32.752
pulling memories
like little grub worms
out of someone's head.

19:32.964 --> 19:34.920
I wanted to put it on
the front of my fridge.

19:36.092 --> 19:40.210
When he's done,
make sure you thank him
for saving Sandra's life.

19:56.905 --> 19:58.441
She's upstairs.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.543
We don't have time for this.

20:14.631 --> 20:16.417
In about 38 minutes,
Ted's going nuclear

20:16.508 --> 20:17.873
unless we bring him back
some hard evidence.

20:17.967 --> 20:21.255
The only thing
we're bringing Ted
is a tranquilizer.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.928
He deserves to
know the truth.

20:24.015 --> 20:26.427
He doesn't want the truth.
He wants his wife back.

20:26.518 --> 20:27.678
Short of that,
he wants revenge

20:27.769 --> 20:29.350
of the good old-fashioned
biblical variety.

20:29.437 --> 20:30.426
No, actually,
he doesn't...

20:30.522 --> 20:33.639
You said yourself,
he'd already pulled
the trigger in his mind.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.853
Okay, so that's it for him.
What about me?

20:36.945 --> 20:38.731
Huh? Are you gonna
send me back to LA
with my wife and baby

20:38.822 --> 20:39.902
and no idea that
this ever happened

20:39.989 --> 20:41.729
so you can pretend to
have a happy family again?

20:41.825 --> 20:43.565
I'm not sending you
anywhere.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.992
You're the only one
I can trust.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.910
Look, here's the deal.

20:47.997 --> 20:50.704
I'll be honest with you.
You be honest with me.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.126
You just try lying to me.

20:55.213 --> 20:56.328
I just signaled the Haitian.

20:56.423 --> 20:57.663
You said no one
would know we're here.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.258
Until I needed them to.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.947
MR. BENNET: Guess who found out
where I live.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.077
What do you think
we should do with him?

21:34.627 --> 21:35.833
But first I have
another "guess who".

21:35.920 --> 21:38.036
Guess who found out
you can talk?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.792
Who have you been talking to?

21:40.884 --> 21:43.091
Who else knows about Claire?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.923
Just her and I,
but that will change.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.474
She wasn't supposed to
remember any of this.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.142
I gave you
specific instructions.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.811
I answer to someone
whose instructions
supersede yours.

21:55.899 --> 21:57.264
In this company?

21:57.650 --> 21:59.356
In your daughter's life.

22:15.835 --> 22:17.336
What's the mission?

22:17.420 --> 22:19.081
Looking into
a security breach.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.538
That's all I know.
That's all they told me.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.123
That's all they
told you to tell me,

22:23.218 --> 22:25.504
but what you know
is considerably more.

22:25.595 --> 22:27.586
You're not as good a liar
as you think.

22:30.808 --> 22:32.594
You're the security breach.

22:33.228 --> 22:34.764
Is that what
they're calling me
behind my back?

22:34.854 --> 22:38.017
I was hoping for something
a bit more subtle,
or a pun at least.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.517
You Americans are
usually good for a pun.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.396
Is it true?
Are you hiding
one of them?

22:42.820 --> 22:44.685
By "them"
you mean people like me?

22:44.781 --> 22:47.568
Is that who you're
accusing me of hiding?

22:47.992 --> 22:49.528
Well, the short answer's yes,
isn't it?

22:49.619 --> 22:51.200
You compromised
what we're doing.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.994
Sorry. I mean,
I know we're serving
the greater good,

22:54.082 --> 22:57.290
but the vivisection
started to keep me
up at night.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.288
Seeing as you're raising
one of us as your own,

22:59.379 --> 23:00.835
I was hoping for
a bit more sympathy.

23:00.922 --> 23:02.162
Claire's not one of you.

23:02.257 --> 23:04.498
Not yet,
but one day, maybe.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.133
And don't tell me
you haven't thought about it.

23:07.512 --> 23:10.299
If she is, then they'll
take her, and it's done.

23:10.390 --> 23:11.846
Oh, just like that?

23:11.933 --> 23:13.048
Father of the year,
you are.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.131
I know who I work for.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.558
So do I.

23:15.853 --> 23:18.139
I was in your office
when they told you to kill me.

23:19.983 --> 23:21.439
Then why'd you get in the car?

23:21.985 --> 23:24.818
Evidently I think you're
a better man than they do.

23:36.457 --> 23:37.663
(SIGHS)

23:37.750 --> 23:39.001
Get out.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.831
It's not the first time
you've been told
to kill a man,

23:46.926 --> 23:48.917
but is it the first time
you've been told
to kill a friend?

23:49.012 --> 23:52.504
Tell me who it is,
and we can forget
about the rest.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.050
You're just gonna do it?

23:54.142 --> 23:55.427
You're just gonna
off me like nothing?

23:55.518 --> 23:57.179
It's not nothing!

23:57.937 --> 24:00.599
We find these people,
that's what we do,
and you buried one.

24:00.690 --> 24:02.931
You acted against
the interest of the company.

24:03.026 --> 24:05.483
Have you ever stopped to think
what those interests are?

24:06.321 --> 24:07.686
Who is it?

24:09.991 --> 24:12.027
And what if it was Claire?

24:13.119 --> 24:15.360
That's why you're
so distant from her.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.616
You know you're
gonna turn her in.

24:17.707 --> 24:19.663
You're preparing for it.

24:20.543 --> 24:21.828
You used to believe in
what we do.

24:21.919 --> 24:23.659
I used to believe
in the tooth fairy.

24:23.755 --> 24:26.462
We made a promise,
both of us.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.540
I will not hunt
my own people.

24:28.635 --> 24:30.546
This isn't who you are.
You have a choice...

24:31.179 --> 24:32.168
(GRUNTS)

24:46.194 --> 24:47.604
Why couldn't you just...

25:07.215 --> 25:08.250
She's my daughter.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.753
You can't be trusted
to put her safety
before company interests.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.003
I've been hiding her
for months.

25:12.095 --> 25:14.802
That's the sort of thing
that will get you killed,
by someone like you,

25:14.889 --> 25:16.504
but it hasn't made
your daughter any safer.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.466
We're running out of time,
and we're not exactly
dealing with a patient man.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.846
All right, look, it's in
Claire's best interest
that we contain this

25:21.938 --> 25:23.269
and we keep her
off the radar.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.854
She could run.
She's safer
in plain sight.

25:24.941 --> 25:25.896
Not at the moment.

25:25.983 --> 25:29.146
No one is going to be safe
unless you give Ted
what he wants.
