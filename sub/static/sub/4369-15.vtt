00:08.759 --> 00:10.051
I don't get it.

00:10.051 --> 00:12.473
Everything was going so well
between Marci and me.

00:12.473 --> 00:14.595
I'm sure it's nothing, Barry.

00:14.595 --> 00:16.097
She just stopped talking
to you in the middle
of your date last night,

00:16.097 --> 00:17.898
and has been avoiding you
ever since.

00:17.898 --> 00:20.641
My mom does that to my dad
all the time.

00:20.641 --> 00:23.444
But she said she felt like
we were playing games
with her,

00:23.444 --> 00:25.736
and she didn't know
what the rules were.

00:25.736 --> 00:28.409
I never knew being
in a relationship could
be so stressful.

00:28.409 --> 00:30.821
You just need something
to take your mind
off of it.

00:30.821 --> 00:33.033
Tell me about

00:33.033 --> 00:35.116
this one-of-a-kind
super-delicate electronic
chip you've been working on.

00:38.749 --> 00:41.712
Like is it
soy sauce resistant?

00:41.712 --> 00:43.714
It's a time-tracking chip
I built using some

00:43.714 --> 00:45.256
of Cyd and Shelby's tachyons.

00:45.256 --> 00:46.627
When the girls jump
through time,

00:46.627 --> 00:48.929
I can locate them
using this receiver.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.591
That's great, Barry.

00:50.591 --> 00:53.094
Is this taking your mind
off your failed relationship
with Marci?

00:53.724 --> 00:54.725
It was.

00:57.638 --> 00:58.769
Oh, man.

00:58.769 --> 01:00.481
Diesel's eating
my Chinese food.

01:00.481 --> 01:01.562
It's no great loss.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.354
It's been in the fridge
for over a year.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.355
Wait. Should I have
been eating that?

01:05.355 --> 01:06.737
Yeah. It's probably okay.

01:06.737 --> 01:07.858
The fridge wasn't
plugged in, anyway.

01:11.612 --> 01:13.694
Wow, Shelby, you look amazing.

01:13.694 --> 01:16.157
Oh, please, Drake!

01:16.157 --> 01:17.248

Hey, I had a really good time
 with you last week.

01:23.964 --> 01:25.206
We should do it
 again sometime.

01:25.206 --> 01:27.378
Oh! Um, yeah, sure.

01:27.378 --> 01:29.210
Whatever.
I mean, we could do that.

01:32.513 --> 01:33.634
Whoa! What happened there?

01:33.634 --> 01:34.885
Lost you for a second.

01:34.885 --> 01:36.887
Oh, bad connection.
And not like our connection.

I'm not clingy.

 I gotta go.
Bye, Drake.

I'm so glad things didn't

to do that much work.

Cyd, Diesel just disappeared.

03:11.362 --> 03:12.983
What do you mean?
Did he run away?

03:12.983 --> 03:15.195
Did somebody yell at him?
Diesel hates when people
yell at him.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.117
(STUTTERS) No, nobody
yelled at him.

03:17.117 --> 03:18.869

"Diesel, you ruined

Get out of here."

03:21.081 --> 03:23.244
Why would somebody say that?
What a random example.

03:24.785 --> 03:26.206
Then why did he run away?

03:26.206 --> 03:27.788
He didn't run away.

03:27.788 --> 03:29.209
He disappeared.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.421
Like into thin air.

03:30.421 --> 03:31.672

"He disappeared"?

03:32.833 --> 03:34.425
I don't understand it either.

03:34.425 --> 03:35.886

Like...

03:35.886 --> 03:36.927
Diesel's a wizard!

03:36.927 --> 03:38.138
Barry experimented
on Diesel.

03:38.138 --> 03:39.680
Barry experimented
on Diesel.

03:41.552 --> 03:43.554
I'll go talk to Barry
and see if he knows anything.

03:43.554 --> 03:45.436
I'll stay here
in case he comes back.

03:45.436 --> 03:49.019
He is gonna
come back, right?

03:49.019 --> 03:51.402
Don't worry, Cyd.
We'll find him.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.119
Barry, Diesel
just disappeared right
in front of me!

03:59.119 --> 04:01.622
He what?
 I figured you had
something to do with it.

04:01.622 --> 04:03.284
Well, I didn't.
I haven't seen Diesel

04:03.284 --> 04:04.745
since he was in here
eating Chinese food.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.287
Oh, no!

04:06.287 --> 04:07.918
Do you think he ate
the tracking chip
I dropped in there?

04:07.918 --> 04:09.870
You dropped
the tracking chip in there?

04:09.870 --> 04:11.462
When were you
gonna tell me?

04:11.462 --> 04:13.634
Remember how you said
that Yellowstone
is a super volcano?

04:13.634 --> 04:14.965
And if it ever erupts
it would destroy

04:14.965 --> 04:16.797
the entire western half
of the United States?

04:16.797 --> 04:17.968
Yes.
 Right after that.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.721
(BEEPING)

04:21.721 --> 04:25.185
The receiver is picking up
a signal from another
timeline.

04:25.185 --> 04:26.727
When Diesel ate
the chip I invented,

04:26.727 --> 04:29.310
it must've somehow
given him the ability
to time travel.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.851
Diesel's lost in time?

04:30.851 --> 04:33.354
This is one of the most
gratifying moments
of my life.

04:33.354 --> 04:34.895
Barry!
 And yet it's tarnished

04:34.895 --> 04:36.357
by the gravity
of the situation.

04:37.988 --> 04:39.660
But because
of the chip he ate,

04:39.660 --> 04:41.362
you can use
this receiver to locate

04:41.362 --> 04:44.074
where Diesel has
time-jumped to
and go and get him.

04:44.074 --> 04:45.666
Here, take this receiver.

04:45.666 --> 04:47.908
You can track Diesel
while the chip
is still inside him,

04:47.908 --> 04:49.710
but only while it's still
inside him.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.121
You mean until he...
 Yes.

04:51.121 --> 04:52.333
Until he...
 Oh, no!

04:52.333 --> 04:53.584
He...a lot.

04:55.175 --> 04:57.297
Ha, ha!

04:57.297 --> 05:00.130
Oh, sorry. I thought you guys
were talking about pooping.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.012
We were.
 Well, in that case...

05:02.012 --> 05:03.514
Ha, ha!

05:05.926 --> 05:07.137
One more thing, Shelby.

05:07.137 --> 05:09.059
Diesel's time travel
is different than yours.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.852
When you time-jump,
you jump into your
own bodies.

05:11.852 --> 05:14.645
Because Diesel ate the chip,
his body travels with him,

05:14.645 --> 05:16.937
so wherever he jumps,
there's gonna be two Diesels.

05:16.937 --> 05:19.490
So, as long as the chip's
still inside his body,

05:19.490 --> 05:20.861
then we can jump
back with him?

05:20.861 --> 05:22.363
Precisely.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.034
And the receiver says
he jumped back...
 (BEEPING)

05:24.034 --> 05:25.616
...to yesterday.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.619
So, you and Cyd better
get him before he
cashes in his chip.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.411
NALDO: Ha, ha!
 Thanks, Renaldo.

05:32.543 --> 05:34.214
I hope we can find him,
so he doesn't stay

05:34.214 --> 05:35.255
lost in time.
 (DOOR OPENS)

05:36.006 --> 05:37.378
Who's lost in time?

05:37.378 --> 05:39.510
Oh, no, no, no.
She said...

05:39.510 --> 05:42.723
"Flossed a mime."

05:42.723 --> 05:45.055
Yup. I just flossed
a mime.

05:45.055 --> 05:48.809
You know, the good thing
about it is you don't
even need floss.

05:52.893 --> 05:53.894
I gotta go.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.778
Barry, do you care
to explain this?

05:57.778 --> 06:00.070
Yeah. So, when
a mime doesn't floss,

06:00.070 --> 06:01.982
he has to go to
the mime dentist.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.824
And that's not good.

06:04.945 --> 06:07.488
That's a mime tooth.

06:07.488 --> 06:10.701
Yeah. Um, I don't think
we can see each other
anymore, Barry.

06:10.701 --> 06:13.373
But, Marci...
 No. You're keeping
secrets from me.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.706
I want a boyfriend who
can tell me everything.

06:15.706 --> 06:17.377
I want to tell
you everything.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.550
But there are some things
that I just...

06:19.550 --> 06:20.841
...can't.

06:20.841 --> 06:22.503
See, it's just like
our date last night

06:22.503 --> 06:24.094
when we were watching
the lunar eclipse.

06:24.094 --> 06:25.846
You're being
very evasive.

06:25.846 --> 06:27.267
I don't like evasiveness.

06:30.641 --> 06:32.012
Unless I'm playing
laser tag.

06:34.224 --> 06:35.476
Or dodgeball.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.486
Okay.
It's 3:00 a.m. yesterday.

06:45.486 --> 06:46.947
Diesel is here
somewhere.

06:46.947 --> 06:49.079
So, Barry said
there are two Diesels?

06:49.079 --> 06:51.291
Yup. We need to bring
back the one with
the ribbon in his collar.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.584
Wait. Why does he have
a ribbon in his collar?

06:53.584 --> 06:55.375
Well, he definitely
wasn't going through
my craft stuff,

06:55.375 --> 06:56.497
while I was video-chatting
with Drake.

06:56.497 --> 06:57.958
That's for sure.
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

06:57.958 --> 07:00.751
Another random example.
Why do I keep doing that?

07:04.254 --> 07:05.806
Do you think the monster
from last night

07:05.806 --> 07:07.307
is going to come
back, Bret?

07:07.307 --> 07:08.759
Don't even say "Monster".

07:08.759 --> 07:10.601
He might come back
'cause he heard his name.

07:10.601 --> 07:13.894
I'll accept that as
a possibility because
I'm afraid.

07:15.395 --> 07:18.649
What are you boys doing
up at 3:00 a.m.?

07:18.649 --> 07:19.820
We can't sleep.

07:19.820 --> 07:21.612
There's a monster
in the house.

07:21.612 --> 07:26.066
I told you not to watch
the Revenge of Bloody Bones
 the other night.

07:26.066 --> 07:29.329
Then again, I also said it was
the must-see horror film
of the '70s.

07:29.329 --> 07:31.662
So, maybe I sent
a mixed message.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.374
But we didn't watch it.

07:34.374 --> 07:36.206
But it's so good.

07:36.206 --> 07:37.998
I mean, go to bed.

07:39.209 --> 07:41.081
Okay.
 We'll go.

07:41.081 --> 07:43.133
But if anything
happens to us,

07:43.133 --> 07:46.046
tell Mom that Chet
licked peanut butter
out of the jar.

07:46.046 --> 07:47.588
She should know.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.853
Oh, what're you girls
doing up?

07:52.853 --> 07:54.515
Uh, lady stuff?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.226
Say no more.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.188
What're you doing
up, Mr. Marcus?

07:58.188 --> 07:59.770
Guy stuff.
 Making a sandwich?

07:59.770 --> 08:01.361
You know it.

08:01.361 --> 08:03.604
You're mother's insisting
we do a juice cleanse.

08:03.604 --> 08:06.777
(SCOFFS) No one tells me
what to eat in my own home,

08:06.777 --> 08:08.318
when she's sleeping.

08:08.318 --> 08:09.319
(JINGLING)

08:10.871 --> 08:12.202
(WHISPERING)
Look, there's
time travel Diesel.

08:13.534 --> 08:16.036
And there is
current-time Diesel.

08:16.036 --> 08:17.878
We can't let my dad
see both Diesels.

08:17.878 --> 08:19.540
He'll freak out.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.173
You should've seen him
when he found there
was a Bret and a Chet.

08:30.260 --> 08:33.183
We gotta distract my dad
so he doesn't see
there are two Diesels.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.975
CYD: I'm on it.

08:34.975 --> 08:37.437
Whoa, Mr. Marcus, you
gotta get some stuff
for your sandwich

08:37.437 --> 08:38.558
from the back
of the fridge.

08:38.558 --> 08:39.770
Good idea.

08:39.770 --> 08:43.273
No. Way back
in the fridge.
 (CLATTERING)

08:43.273 --> 08:45.856
Quick. Grab time travel Diesel
before your dad realizes

08:45.856 --> 08:47.237
there's nothing back
there but batteries.

08:47.237 --> 08:49.570
There's nothing
back here but batteries.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.411
Dang it! He's on to us.

08:51.411 --> 08:54.074
He's heading that way.
 I'll get him.

08:54.074 --> 08:56.416
No, Dad. Behind
the batteries.
 (GRUNTS)

08:56.416 --> 08:58.158
Okay.

08:58.158 --> 09:00.581
Why are there
three open salsa
jars in here?

09:00.581 --> 09:02.753
Uh, there should
be seven.
 (CLATTERING)

09:02.753 --> 09:05.165
Find them all, Dad.
It's a fun fridge game.

09:05.165 --> 09:06.166
(GROANING)

09:08.629 --> 09:11.381
Hey, buddy. You want
a piece of turkey?

09:11.381 --> 09:13.013
We got the wrong Diesel!

09:13.013 --> 09:14.264
What was that?

09:14.264 --> 09:17.888
I just asked Cyd to
give me a strong squeezel.

09:17.888 --> 09:20.601
You know how we do.
(LAUGHS)

09:21.942 --> 09:23.523
You girls are odd.

09:27.778 --> 09:31.111
There's Mr. Marcus
making his late night
sandwich again.

09:31.111 --> 09:33.323
You know, I feel like
I'm lying to Mrs. Marcus

09:33.323 --> 09:36.196
when I tell her,
"Nothing's up."

09:36.196 --> 09:39.079
Lunar eclipse starts
in 10 minutes.
What do you wanna talk about?

09:39.079 --> 09:41.371
How fun it would be if
Marci watched the
lunar eclipse with us.

09:41.371 --> 09:43.123
Oh, that would be awful.

09:43.123 --> 09:44.665
Things have been
so awkward since
Cyd and Shelby

09:44.665 --> 09:46.797
told us we
like each other.

09:46.797 --> 09:49.379
You invited Marci to watch
the lunar eclipse
with us, didn't you?

09:49.379 --> 09:51.051
Barry, what do I look like?

09:51.051 --> 09:52.713
Is it a guy who
invited Marci?

09:52.713 --> 09:54.384
'Cause that's what I am.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.477
Hiya, fellas.

09:57.477 --> 10:00.180
You know, I didn't think
it would get awkward
this fast.

10:00.180 --> 10:01.982
Oh, is this
an awkward moment?

10:01.982 --> 10:03.984
See, I have this condition
where I can't tell when
things get awkward.

10:03.984 --> 10:06.817
I also like to put
my finger in other
people's belly buttons.

10:06.817 --> 10:10.070
Does this make things awkward?
I have no idea.

10:11.031 --> 10:12.903
Hey, Marci.

10:12.903 --> 10:15.826
I've been thinking
a lot about what Cyd
and Shelby said about us,

10:15.826 --> 10:18.158
and, well, I think
Johannes Kepler
put it best

10:18.158 --> 10:20.200
in his third law
of planetary motion,

10:20.200 --> 10:23.503
"The ratio of the squares
of the periods
of any two planets

10:23.503 --> 10:27.207
"is equal to the ratio of
the cubes of their average
distances from the sun."

10:27.207 --> 10:28.548
Barry, I like you, too.

10:28.548 --> 10:31.511
Oh, good. I really
put my heart out there.

10:32.342 --> 10:34.134
So...

10:34.134 --> 10:35.716
What do we do now?

10:35.716 --> 10:38.138
I'm not sure. If we
were white-fronted parrots
it'd be easy.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.811
We'd knock our beaks
together and vomit
on each other.

10:41.601 --> 10:43.063
And if we were angler fish

10:43.063 --> 10:45.185
I'd release an enzyme that
bonded our skin together,

10:45.185 --> 10:46.476
and I could live off
whatever you ate.

10:46.476 --> 10:49.149
Oh, you sure know
how to charm a lady.

10:50.070 --> 10:51.651
I have an idea.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.693
Why don't you
make watching
the lunar eclipse

10:52.693 --> 10:53.944
with us your first date?

10:53.944 --> 10:55.195
All three of us?

10:55.195 --> 10:56.947
Well...
(SCOFFS)

10:56.947 --> 10:58.618
It wouldn't be
much of a date if
it was just me and Marci.

11:01.241 --> 11:03.583
CYD: Mr. Marcus, are
you almost done
making that sandwich?

11:03.583 --> 11:06.206
You know what?
Forget the pickles.
(SIGHS)

11:06.206 --> 11:08.879
If my sandwich
is too crunchy,
Astrid will know.

11:08.879 --> 11:10.791
Because you know
what doesn't crunch?

11:10.791 --> 11:12.923
Juice.

11:12.923 --> 11:15.675
I'm gonna go eat
this upstairs.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.387
Good. He didn't see
both Diesels.
 (DIESEL BARKING)

11:18.218 --> 11:19.720
There he is!
Get him!

11:20.721 --> 11:21.722
(WHIMPERS)

11:23.353 --> 11:25.685
He just disappeared!
 We were so close!

11:27.437 --> 11:29.069
What if we don't
get him in time?

11:29.069 --> 11:31.401
What if he poops
that chip and we
lose him forever?

11:31.401 --> 11:32.983
We'll get him, Cyd.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.075
We have to.
 (RECEIVER BEEPING)

11:35.075 --> 11:36.656
It says he's gone back
one more day.

11:36.656 --> 11:38.578
So, two days from
when we started.

11:38.578 --> 11:40.620
We'll follow him.
It'll be okay.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.166
I love the night.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.919
Looking up into the sky,
seeing the whole universe.

11:48.919 --> 11:50.420
It's funny.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.382
When it's light out,
we see our own tiny
world better,

11:52.382 --> 11:54.544
but we miss the rest
of everything.

11:54.544 --> 11:56.096
Well...

11:56.096 --> 11:57.387
(CHUCKLES)
Not everything.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.683
I love how sweaty
your palms are.

12:03.683 --> 12:06.226
Man, I can't stop
thinking about
how these same stars

12:06.226 --> 12:08.939
were sparkling millions,
even billions of years ago.

12:08.939 --> 12:12.062
And it took their light
this long to reach us.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.775
So, in a way, it's like
they are time travelers.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.947
Hey. Kinda like
Cyd and Shelby...

12:16.947 --> 12:18.488
Huh?
 Uh...

12:18.488 --> 12:22.122
He was just saying that
he kinda likes Cyd and Shelby.

12:22.122 --> 12:25.625
They're nice girls.
What's not to
kinda like?

12:25.625 --> 12:27.367
What were you really
going to say, Naldo?

12:27.367 --> 12:29.749
Don't worry, Barry.
I got this.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.082
I was gonna say
that stars are like
time travelers

12:32.082 --> 12:35.005
which makes them similar
to Cyd and Shelby
who are also...

12:35.005 --> 12:36.046
You didn't have it,
did you?

12:39.930 --> 12:42.262
Okay. I feel like
you guys are playing
games with me,

12:42.262 --> 12:44.144
and I don't know
what the rules are.

12:44.144 --> 12:46.096
But, Marci...
 I think I'll
go home now.

12:46.096 --> 12:47.227
I'll see you
tomorrow, Barry.

12:47.227 --> 12:49.309
But, Marci...

12:49.309 --> 12:50.650
Hey.

12:50.650 --> 12:52.442
Is that Mr. Marcus
leaning out of his window

12:52.442 --> 12:54.154
eating a sandwich?

12:54.154 --> 12:57.067

Nope. You're

and he's only five!

14:08.728 --> 14:11.932
Diesel's hasn't
gone for a while.
And he's due.

14:11.932 --> 14:13.643
I don't know
what that means.

14:47.347 --> 14:48.718
we can throw at them
that they'll go after.

14:48.718 --> 14:50.770
Nope. They're all
full of shredded paper.

14:50.770 --> 14:52.973
Why would that night club
throw out shredded paper?

14:52.973 --> 14:54.975
I think it's the office
building right behind us.

right above...

I can't take this anymore!

15:01.901 --> 15:03.613

 No, Cyd.

15:03.613 --> 15:04.614
You'll never make it.

15:06.786 --> 15:08.618
How can this be happening?

inside that club,

15:09.950 --> 15:12.032

we can do.

he can't come back with us.

in this timeline
forever.

I'm gonna lose Diesel.

lived here, they
were always at work.

He messed everything up
this morning and
I yelled at him,

15:53.994 --> 15:57.167
I told him to go away,
and that's when
he disappeared.

say anything?

15:58.418 --> 16:01.751
I just felt so guilty.

16:01.751 --> 16:03.503
I shouldn't have
yelled at him.

And now you're gonna
lose Diesel because of me.

you were talking about.

there are supposed to be.

Well, Diesel passed
the chip, so he can
no longer time travel.

17:43.643 --> 17:45.275
And you got
your chip back.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.817
I'll just make a new one.

17:49.779 --> 17:53.323
Wait. Can people use
the chip to time travel
the way Diesel could?

17:53.323 --> 17:56.786
No, the chip does not have
enough power to transport
anything larger than Diesel.

17:56.786 --> 18:00.660
For a human to be able
to time travel, he'd have
to swallow a chip this size.

I could do it.

I really like her
and it's not gonna work out.

Hey, guys.
Barry, I left my
binoculars here.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.977
My aunt needs them
to watch her son.

18:17.977 --> 18:19.979
Oh, is he in a recital
or something?

18:19.979 --> 18:22.812
Oh, no, he's very small
and he likes to play far away.

18:25.565 --> 18:27.147
So, Marci.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.859
You and Barry
are pretty great
for each other.

No, I don't give my heart
to people I don't trust,
and Barry keeps secrets.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.158
Barry, why are you
keeping secrets
from Marci?

you're in on. I gotta go.

Oh, no, wait, Marci,
just a second.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.140
Barry, Cyd and I
almost lost Diesel

19:01.140 --> 19:03.683
and it was the worst feeling
in the world.

19:03.683 --> 19:05.855
I don't want you
to feel that way.

19:05.855 --> 19:07.437
Marci is your Diesel.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.648
Marci is my dog?

19:10.109 --> 19:13.653

for something special
you can't let get away.

how special someone is,
until you lose them.

And we're not gonna
let you lose Marci.

19:25.585 --> 19:29.339
It's okay.
You can tell her.
 You sure?

19:31.671 --> 19:34.424
Marci, I have been keeping
a secret from you.

19:34.424 --> 19:35.555
The truth is...

19:36.796 --> 19:38.388
Cyd and Shelby
are time travelers.

19:38.388 --> 19:40.220
Now, I know it sounds
totally insane.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.101
Finally, something
that makes sense.

19:44.063 --> 19:47.016
You just buy that
without proof or anything?

Oh, sure.

and then we went
to the '70s

19:59.028 --> 20:00.029
and we were all...

20:04.874 --> 20:05.955
Huh?

20:07.377 --> 20:08.918
We'll just let Barry
explain it to you.

20:08.918 --> 20:09.959
See you later.

20:12.332 --> 20:15.174
Marci, I am so relieved
we got that worked out,

20:15.174 --> 20:17.096
and is your finger
in my belly button?

20:17.096 --> 20:19.299
Oh, I'm sorry,
is that awkward?

20:19.299 --> 20:20.760
I think now that
we're dating, it's okay.

20:24.514 --> 20:26.225
BRETT: Like Dad
always says, Chet,

20:26.225 --> 20:27.647
we have to face our fears.

20:27.647 --> 20:31.611
And brush our teeth
in a circular motion.

20:31.611 --> 20:35.114
The only way
to take down a monster
is to out-monster it.

20:35.114 --> 20:36.276
(THUD)

20:36.276 --> 20:38.528
The monster's coming!
 Man your station!

20:42.782 --> 20:45.365
(GHOSTLY ROARING)
 (EXCLAIMING)

20:49.959 --> 20:53.713
Dad's going to be so proud
of us for facing our fears
like he said.

20:53.713 --> 20:56.756
We are the greatest things
that ever happened to him.

20:58.047 --> 20:59.969
(ROARING)

20:59.969 --> 21:01.591
What is going on
down there?

21:01.591 --> 21:03.182
I'm sure we'll find out
about it in the...

21:03.182 --> 21:04.644
Don't say, "Future."

21:06.806 --> 21:09.058
Oh, no. We're back
in the future lab.

21:09.058 --> 21:11.270
But after I punched
the hazmat guy.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.483
Janet Smythe and her guards
will be here any second.

21:13.483 --> 21:15.154
We gotta go.
 Wait.

21:15.154 --> 21:16.896
There's one thing
I wanna see first.

21:26.706 --> 21:27.667
Barry?

21:28.305 --> 21:34.384
