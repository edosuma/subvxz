00:16.787 --> 00:18.118
Find everything okay?

00:18.188 --> 00:19.849
I did. Thank you.

00:21.191 --> 00:24.627
You have a beautiful accent.
Let me guess, Madagascar?

00:24.695 --> 00:27.094
Nigeria.

00:32.336 --> 00:34.429
Whoa, you're giving me
too much here.

00:34.505 --> 00:38.134
Okay, um, this is a dime.
This is ten cents.

00:38.208 --> 00:39.232
This is a ten?

00:39.310 --> 00:40.299
Mmm-hmm.

00:40.377 --> 00:43.505
And this is five.
But it is bigger.

00:43.580 --> 00:44.740
I will never
understand.

00:44.815 --> 00:46.372
It's no problem.

00:46.449 --> 00:47.848
So do you live
around here?

00:47.917 --> 00:50.351
No, I am visiting
for one week.

00:50.420 --> 00:52.718
Then I'm going home
to my husband.

00:53.690 --> 00:55.590
Well, "married" is
an interesting word.

00:55.658 --> 00:58.286
It means different things
to different people.

00:58.361 --> 01:00.386
To me, it means
everything.

01:01.030 --> 01:03.294
I was afraid
you'd say that.

01:03.366 --> 01:05.630
Well, tell your husband
that he is a lucky man.

01:05.702 --> 01:08.637
Actually, I'm
the lucky one.

01:08.705 --> 01:10.070
Good night.

02:01.923 --> 02:04.255
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:04.326 --> 02:06.851
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:08.896 --> 02:11.229
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:11.299 --> 02:12.288
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:12.367 --> 02:15.234
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

02:15.303 --> 02:17.396
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:18.974 --> 02:22.205
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

02:22.277 --> 02:24.609
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

02:24.679 --> 02:25.668
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:25.747 --> 02:29.012
<i>It's amazing</i>

02:29.084 --> 02:30.551
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

02:30.619 --> 02:32.246
<i>'cause I worry all the time</i>

02:32.320 --> 02:35.585
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

02:35.657 --> 02:36.954
<i>You better pay attention</i>

02:37.025 --> 02:39.892
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

02:39.961 --> 02:42.862
<i>might just kill you</i>

02:43.732 --> 02:45.962
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

02:46.034 --> 02:47.729
<i>But I don't think so</i>

02:47.803 --> 02:50.465
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

02:50.539 --> 02:52.632
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:58.898 --> 03:00.263
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm not finished.

03:04.571 --> 03:05.697
Okay?
Almost.

03:09.741 --> 03:10.730
You done?

03:10.809 --> 03:13.004
Hold on, Mr. Monk. I'm sorry
I don't read as fast as you.

03:13.078 --> 03:14.477
Nobody does.

03:17.049 --> 03:18.141
Okay.

03:24.089 --> 03:25.078
Hold on.

03:25.157 --> 03:26.886
Natalie, why don't
you buy your own copy?

03:26.959 --> 03:28.426
There's a newsstand
right down the street.

03:28.494 --> 03:29.893
Actually, Mr. Monk,
that is my copy.

03:29.995 --> 03:32.225
Okay, fine, take it.
Take it, read it.

03:32.431 --> 03:33.489
You can finish it
when I'm done.

03:33.565 --> 03:35.089
Yeah, it'll be
old news by then.

03:35.167 --> 03:37.260
We'll have
a new president.

03:41.139 --> 03:42.163
What?

03:45.811 --> 03:47.904
What?
You smell that?

03:47.980 --> 03:49.777
Is that you?
Is what me?

03:49.848 --> 03:51.748
Are you cooking bacon?

03:51.817 --> 03:54.718
Does it look like
I'm cooking bacon?

03:54.786 --> 03:56.549
It's coming from outside.

04:00.492 --> 04:02.392
I knew it. It's a hippie.

04:03.896 --> 04:04.954
It's incense.

04:05.030 --> 04:06.759
He's burning incense
down there.

04:06.832 --> 04:08.459
By the way, that's a
perfect name for that stuff

04:08.534 --> 04:10.263
Because that's how
people react to it.

04:10.335 --> 04:12.963
They get incensed.
Get it?

04:13.038 --> 04:14.335
Incense, incensed.

04:14.406 --> 04:15.805
You add the "D."
Forget it.

04:16.909 --> 04:18.206
Hey!

04:18.277 --> 04:21.041
You can't sell that stuff
without a permit.

04:21.380 --> 04:23.279
I am not selling
anything.

04:23.347 --> 04:26.544
Of course you're not. Nobody
wants to buy that junk.

04:26.617 --> 04:29.415
Find another
street. Bye.

04:29.487 --> 04:31.421
Peace and love,
and Woodstock.

04:31.489 --> 04:32.717
Woodstock?

04:32.790 --> 04:34.314
You heard me!

04:37.995 --> 04:40.520
How can you not smell that?
Maybe we should call the cops.

04:40.598 --> 04:43.089
We don't have to.
That was the cops.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.156
We have a job.

04:44.235 --> 04:45.702
Thank God.

04:45.770 --> 04:47.397
Finally be able
to breathe.

04:48.873 --> 04:52.036
I can't breathe.
Open a window.

04:52.109 --> 04:55.442
It is open. Why don't
we light some incense?

04:56.180 --> 04:59.809
Dr. Z says she's been
dead 12 days, give or take.

04:59.917 --> 05:02.579
Her name was Maria
Fuentes, 37 years old.

05:02.653 --> 05:04.621
She was the housekeeper.

05:04.689 --> 05:05.849
Those are the owners
out there,

05:05.923 --> 05:07.322
John and Carolyn Buxton.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.585
They just got back
from Barbados.

05:08.693 --> 05:10.456
Maria stayed
behind.

05:10.528 --> 05:12.723
She was supposed
to lock up the house.

05:12.797 --> 05:14.321
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.592
Randy.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.794
Do you want some liniment
cream? Lt'll kill the smell.

05:18.869 --> 05:22.066
Nope, I'm fine. It's
not my first crime scene.

05:22.139 --> 05:24.164
They got home this
morning at about 8:30,

05:24.241 --> 05:27.335
came in from the garage,
he saw his cell phone.

05:27.411 --> 05:29.208
Yeah, Buxton
left his cell phone.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.214
I guess he
was on vacation.

05:31.282 --> 05:32.772
So when they came in
from the garage,

05:32.850 --> 05:35.044
that's when
the smell hit them.

05:38.788 --> 05:41.086
Are you trying
to impress that girl?

05:41.157 --> 05:43.250
What girl?
The CSI tech.

05:43.360 --> 05:45.794
You think that's a quality
she's looking for in a man?

05:45.862 --> 05:46.886
Do you think
she's saying,

05:46.997 --> 05:48.362
"Why can't I meet
an attractive,

05:48.431 --> 05:49.728
"thirtysomething
non-smoker

05:49.799 --> 05:53.166
"who's oblivious to the
stench of rotting flesh?"

05:53.236 --> 05:56.535
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.533
Anyway, he came in,

05:59.609 --> 06:02.100
and he practically
tripped over the body.

06:02.178 --> 06:04.271
Is there anything
missing from the house?

06:04.347 --> 06:05.507
No, they're saying no.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.015
It might have
been personal.

06:07.083 --> 06:09.517
She had a boyfriend,
or an ex-boyfriend.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.247
He did two months
for assault last year.

06:11.321 --> 06:12.618
She was only hit twice.

06:12.689 --> 06:16.250
Ah, so not a crime
of passion.

06:24.334 --> 06:26.768
What do you got?

06:28.972 --> 06:31.065
It's an earring.
One earring.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.165
She took it off.

06:32.242 --> 06:33.402
Hmm.

06:34.611 --> 06:37.409
And this is a first aid handbook.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.471
Did someone try
to treat her?

06:39.549 --> 06:40.777
I asked the owners.

06:40.850 --> 06:44.251
That book normally lives
on the shelf down below.

06:44.320 --> 06:45.981
It was open like that
when they found her.

06:46.089 --> 06:47.385
Maybe
the killer felt bad,

06:47.456 --> 06:50.425
like remorse,
and tried to help her.

06:50.492 --> 06:52.187
There's blood
on the book,

06:52.261 --> 06:54.286
but the countertop
underneath is clean.

06:54.363 --> 06:55.387
What does
that mean?

06:55.464 --> 06:56.522
It means
it was already there.

06:56.598 --> 06:58.998
It was already like that
when she was killed.

06:59.068 --> 07:02.196
So the killer opened the book
to the page about head trauma

07:02.271 --> 07:04.262
before he hit her
over the head?

07:04.339 --> 07:06.136
So it would appear.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.105
That's
very unusual.

07:10.212 --> 07:12.373
Are you sure you're okay?
You're turning green.

07:12.448 --> 07:15.679
Oh, I'm just hungry.
Green with hunger.

07:15.751 --> 07:17.343
You're green
with hunger?

07:17.486 --> 07:18.714
Yeah, it's a...

07:18.787 --> 07:20.015
You never heard
that before?

07:20.089 --> 07:21.078
No, I never have.

07:21.156 --> 07:24.717
Oh, it's a very
common expression.

07:24.793 --> 07:27.591
I've got to...
I've got to go.

07:27.663 --> 07:29.722
Somebody called maybe.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.436
Just checking
on some evidence.

07:40.008 --> 07:41.032
Sergeant.

08:04.932 --> 08:06.900
For the love
of crackers.

08:16.377 --> 08:18.572
I should have known.

08:18.646 --> 08:20.011
Do you mind?

08:20.615 --> 08:24.278
It's 7:45. People are trying to sleep.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.717
They are?
Yes, they are.

08:27.789 --> 08:30.019
So cut out
the jam session.

08:30.091 --> 08:32.025
This is not
the Fillmore West,

08:32.092 --> 08:36.291
and you are not
Louis Armstrong. Okay?

08:36.364 --> 08:39.799
Look, here's $5.
All right?

08:39.866 --> 08:42.427
Go to the park and buy yourself a drink.

08:42.503 --> 08:44.937
I'm sorry,
but I cannot leave.

08:45.006 --> 08:46.769
Sure you can.
I'll help you.

08:46.841 --> 08:49.674
You do not understand.
I cannot leave this corner.

08:49.744 --> 08:50.904
Why not?

08:50.978 --> 08:53.003
My wife was killed here.

08:59.353 --> 09:00.752
Your wife?

09:03.991 --> 09:07.222
Two weeks ago,
on this corner.

09:10.598 --> 09:12.462
This is sacred ground.

09:20.473 --> 09:21.963
Here we are.

09:23.577 --> 09:27.308
Please, make yourself
comfortable.

09:30.150 --> 09:32.243
I have some juice.

09:32.319 --> 09:33.752
I'm very happy for you.

09:33.820 --> 09:37.449
No, no, no, no. I'm
offering you some juice.

09:37.524 --> 09:39.788
Would you like
some juice?

09:39.860 --> 09:41.885
Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you.

09:49.436 --> 09:51.734
I don't know
your name.

09:51.805 --> 09:52.999
Monk.

09:54.641 --> 09:57.705
Adrian.

09:59.012 --> 10:00.445
What does it mean?

10:00.580 --> 10:02.480
It means nobody picks you
for their softball team

10:02.549 --> 10:04.517
in seventh grade.

10:04.951 --> 10:06.851
I am Samuel Waingaya.

10:09.389 --> 10:10.947
Tell me about her.

10:12.225 --> 10:13.590
Here, sit down.

10:13.660 --> 10:18.563
Her name was Ansara.
It means "sunflower. "

10:18.632 --> 10:21.624
That is what she was.
She was a school teacher.

10:21.701 --> 10:24.669
This is why she was here,
a teaching conference,

10:24.737 --> 10:26.830
two weeks in
San Francisco.

10:27.506 --> 10:29.201
She was so excited.

10:29.275 --> 10:31.004
What happened?

10:31.343 --> 10:33.140
I don't know exactly,

10:33.212 --> 10:34.702
but she was
at the grocery store

10:34.780 --> 10:37.271
down the street buying food, Mmm.

10:37.583 --> 10:40.677
And a vehicle, I think a van,
drove through a red light.

10:42.788 --> 10:43.846
It kept going.

10:43.923 --> 10:46.790
Ah, a hit-and-run. I
remember reading about that.

10:47.259 --> 10:49.955
I was out of town
when it happened.

10:50.529 --> 10:54.192
But it was in all the
newspapers when I got back.

10:55.367 --> 10:56.959
How do they know
it was a van?

10:57.036 --> 10:59.095
They don't,
but I do.

10:59.171 --> 11:01.036
I saw the tire tracks
on the street.

11:01.106 --> 11:03.370
They were still there
when I got here.

11:03.442 --> 11:05.137
I know something
about cars.

11:05.244 --> 11:07.235
I'm a mechanic back home.

11:13.719 --> 11:16.882
They were in the road.
They are from a headlamp.

11:16.956 --> 11:19.049
Have you been
to the police?

11:19.124 --> 11:20.284
Yes.

11:20.793 --> 11:23.125
They are doing
all they can.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.358
That is what they say.

11:26.131 --> 11:27.928
And you made these?

11:28.867 --> 11:32.030
"Reward for information.
12,000 naira. "

11:33.038 --> 11:34.835
That's very generous.

11:35.674 --> 11:37.368
Not really.

11:37.442 --> 11:40.070
It is $85.

11:42.113 --> 11:44.673
I am not a rich man
like you.

11:44.816 --> 11:45.976
Yes.

11:50.154 --> 11:51.451
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:51.522 --> 11:52.887
What, what, what, what,
what is this?

11:52.957 --> 11:55.619
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:55.693 --> 11:58.059
It's so rude of me.
Please, would you like one?

11:58.129 --> 12:00.393
No, no, no, thank you.

12:00.465 --> 12:04.367
But do you...
Do you have to...

12:04.435 --> 12:06.062
It calms my nerves.

12:06.137 --> 12:08.867
You did say for me
to make myself at home.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.202
Did I misunderstand?

12:10.274 --> 12:13.641
No, no. Okay,
wait a minute. Hold on.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.312
Here.

12:25.823 --> 12:28.121
Breathe it
into this. Okay?

12:29.293 --> 12:30.351
See?

12:37.835 --> 12:39.302
There you go.

12:40.304 --> 12:41.965
And there you are.

12:44.175 --> 12:46.507
I love it.

12:46.577 --> 12:48.169
It's ingenious.

12:48.246 --> 12:49.473
What do you call it?

12:49.546 --> 12:51.138
A smoking bag.

12:51.982 --> 12:53.540
I've never heard
of such a thing.

12:53.617 --> 12:54.982
Is it new?

12:55.052 --> 12:56.917
Yes, it's brand-new.

12:57.687 --> 13:00.622
This would be very
popular in Nigeria.

13:00.690 --> 13:02.681
Right, right.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.158
Here you go.

13:12.869 --> 13:16.100
I am sorry to wake you, Adrian Monk.

13:16.173 --> 13:18.164
It will not
happen again.

13:19.676 --> 13:21.667
Thank you
for the juice.

13:23.246 --> 13:25.544
Yeah, Samuel,
don't go.

13:26.316 --> 13:28.250
Um, I'm...

13:28.852 --> 13:30.752
I'm a police detective.

13:30.887 --> 13:34.152
I'm... I'm very
good at it.

13:34.224 --> 13:36.089
I'm sure you are.

13:36.159 --> 13:37.820
Here's the thing.

13:37.894 --> 13:39.759
I want to help you.

13:39.830 --> 13:41.388
I...

13:41.465 --> 13:43.933
I'm going to help you.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.867
We're gonna find the man
who killed your wife.

13:46.937 --> 13:48.928
You want to help me?

13:49.005 --> 13:50.905
But I don't understand.

14:41.724 --> 14:44.921
Wow. It's just
like in the movies.

14:44.994 --> 14:47.224
You've never been here? You
said you spoke to the police.

14:47.296 --> 14:49.730
Downstairs, just for
10 minutes only.

14:49.798 --> 14:51.857
They said that
they would call me.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.629
Two weeks.

14:54.203 --> 14:55.534
No calls.

14:55.604 --> 14:56.832
No hope.

14:56.906 --> 14:58.737
Until now.

14:58.807 --> 15:00.069
Do you drink coffee?

15:00.142 --> 15:01.370
I love coffee.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.808
Then you're
gonna hate this.

15:06.215 --> 15:08.149
What?

15:08.217 --> 15:10.447
What you said
about the coffee.

15:12.655 --> 15:13.917
It was very funny.

15:14.289 --> 15:15.278
Am I that funny?

15:15.356 --> 15:16.584
No.

15:16.658 --> 15:18.285
Hey, here it is.

15:18.359 --> 15:20.190
Technically, you
shouldn't be seeing this.

15:20.261 --> 15:22.786
This is from a gas station
surveillance camera.

15:23.631 --> 15:26.259
It's about a minute
after the accident,

15:27.902 --> 15:30.803
half a mile east.

15:30.872 --> 15:32.430
Excuse me,
Captain Stottlemeyer.

15:32.507 --> 15:34.236
It was not an accident.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.368
When he hit her,
that was an accident.

15:36.444 --> 15:39.572
Driving away
and leaving her there,

15:39.647 --> 15:41.239
that was murder.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.012
I appreciate that, Mr.
Waingaya. That's why we're here.

15:44.085 --> 15:47.248
Oh, here it is.
8:17:02.

15:47.322 --> 15:49.882
There. We think
that's the guy.

15:49.958 --> 15:52.358
He's moving pretty quick,
and he's missing a headlamp.

15:52.427 --> 15:55.419
You were right.
It's a van.

15:58.433 --> 16:00.594
What does that mean?

16:00.835 --> 16:03.065
You do not want to know.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.436
Adrian Monk knows.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.030
What about the headlight?
Can we trace it?

16:07.108 --> 16:09.303
We've got Sergeant
Kramer's report right here.

16:09.377 --> 16:10.401
He already tried.

16:10.478 --> 16:12.673
Every garage within ten
miles. Nothing turned up.

16:12.747 --> 16:16.183
Uh, Mr. Waingaya,
the case is open.

16:16.251 --> 16:18.583
Sergeant Kramer's a good
guy. He's gonna do his best.

16:18.653 --> 16:22.749
But cases like this are
very, very hard to solve.

16:22.824 --> 16:24.121
Do you understand?

16:24.192 --> 16:26.285
You can't
expect miracles.

16:26.361 --> 16:30.387
Ansara used to say,
"Miracles happen every day.

16:31.365 --> 16:33.890
"You just have to know
where to look. "

16:35.302 --> 16:37.702
Excuse me, there's no
smoking in the building.

16:37.771 --> 16:40.262
It's okay, Lieutenant
Disher, I know the routine.

16:40.340 --> 16:42.365
I brought
my smoking bag.

16:42.442 --> 16:44.706
Your smoking bag?

16:44.911 --> 16:47.277
He's trying to quit. He's
down to two bags a day.

16:53.120 --> 16:54.212
Did you hear that?

16:54.288 --> 16:57.257
She said "two bags"
instead of "two packs. "

17:03.030 --> 17:05.999
Thank you so much,
Natalie Teeger,

17:06.066 --> 17:08.296
for teaching me
how to laugh again.

17:08.367 --> 17:09.528
You know, there's
a smoking section

17:09.603 --> 17:11.194
down at the
end of the hall.

17:11.271 --> 17:13.329
Natalie, Randy, why don't
you take Mr. Waingaya

17:13.406 --> 17:14.464
and his bag...

17:14.540 --> 17:16.599
We don't have
a smoking area.

17:16.676 --> 17:19.271
Just go to the conference
room and open a window.

17:19.346 --> 17:20.438
Yes, sir.

17:20.513 --> 17:21.981
Uh, Mr. Waingaya,
if you'll follow me.

17:22.049 --> 17:25.848
Yes. Two bags,
it's very funny.

17:27.487 --> 17:28.818
Where is
"picture go regular"?

17:28.889 --> 17:30.686
What are you doing?

17:31.792 --> 17:32.850
Well, I might have
missed something.

17:32.926 --> 17:35.520
No, no, no, I'm talking
about your friend Samuel.

17:35.595 --> 17:38.462
What are you doing getting
his hopes up like that?

17:38.532 --> 17:40.692
You and I both know
the odds against solving

17:40.766 --> 17:42.961
a two-week-old hit-and-run
with virtually no evidence.

17:43.035 --> 17:45.367
Monk, it's 1,000 to 1,
probably worse.

17:46.472 --> 17:47.632
Now this case,

17:47.707 --> 17:50.574
Maria Fuentes,
the murdered housekeeper.

17:50.643 --> 17:53.043
This case, this case is
fresh. It's piping hot.

17:53.112 --> 17:54.943
It's solvable
if we act fast.

17:55.648 --> 17:57.013
Now, Randy and I are
going back to the house.

17:57.083 --> 17:58.675
We're gonna walk the property,
talk to the neighbors.

17:58.784 --> 18:00.649
I can't help you.
I'm sorry.

18:00.720 --> 18:02.119
I'm working with Samuel.

18:02.988 --> 18:04.478
You're working
with Samuel?

18:04.557 --> 18:07.185
He lost his wife, Leland.

18:07.259 --> 18:10.194
They ran Trudy over
and just kept on driving.

18:11.497 --> 18:13.158
You mean Ansara.

18:16.202 --> 18:17.965
Trudy was your wife.

18:20.639 --> 18:22.129
Wait a second.

18:22.208 --> 18:24.699
Picture, go back.
Make picture go back.

18:24.777 --> 18:25.903
All right, all right.

18:26.946 --> 18:28.413
There you go.

18:30.816 --> 18:32.545
Picture go regular.

18:35.121 --> 18:37.021
Is that the same van?

18:39.458 --> 18:41.187
He turned around.

18:44.697 --> 18:47.188
The surveillance
camera is there.

18:48.968 --> 18:51.697
He was driving west.
He was getting away.

18:52.670 --> 18:56.367
Then he turned around.
Why would he turn around?

18:56.808 --> 18:57.832
Guilt.

18:57.909 --> 19:01.037
No, he did not come back to
help my wife, or call a doctor.

19:01.112 --> 19:03.080
There was no guilt.

19:03.148 --> 19:05.207
Excuse me. How are you guys doing?

19:05.283 --> 19:06.648
We're living
the dream, man.

19:06.751 --> 19:11.848
Great. Are you guys here a
lot drinking beer, hanging out?

19:11.923 --> 19:14.153
Slacking,
you know, off?

19:14.225 --> 19:16.090
Slacking off?

19:16.161 --> 19:17.253
Are you a cop?

19:17.328 --> 19:19.421
Not technically.
It's a long story.

19:19.497 --> 19:21.624
Hey, we got time.
And we love stories.

19:21.699 --> 19:24.532
All right. Well, I was suffering
from what the doctors called

19:24.602 --> 19:25.591
a psychotic break...

19:25.670 --> 19:27.035
Mr. Monk, they don't care. No.

19:27.105 --> 19:29.835
Okay, there was a hit-and-run
two weeks ago on Pine Street.

19:29.908 --> 19:31.136
Did you hear
anything about it?

19:31.209 --> 19:33.677
It was on the 17th,
a Tuesday night.

19:33.745 --> 19:35.645
Please try to remember.

19:36.748 --> 19:39.581
Were you guys here
that night around 8:15?

19:40.585 --> 19:41.950
Probably.

19:42.821 --> 19:46.621
Do you remember seeing a
van with a broken headlight?

19:46.691 --> 19:48.181
He was going that way.

19:48.259 --> 19:49.851
He must have been
doing about 80.

19:49.928 --> 19:52.055
Wait, yeah, yeah.

19:52.497 --> 19:54.522
Dude, they won't let us use
the bathroom here, right?

19:54.599 --> 19:56.829
So I had to cross the street
and use the one at that diner.

19:56.901 --> 19:58.892
And some dude in a van almost hit me.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.699
Do you remember this?

20:00.772 --> 20:02.205
There's a bathroom
in that diner?

20:03.508 --> 20:04.599
I will never forget it,

20:04.675 --> 20:07.269
even if I live to be,
like, as old as you, man.

20:07.344 --> 20:09.904
Thirty seconds later,
same guy, same van,

20:09.980 --> 20:12.005
flips a U-ey,
almost hits me again.

20:12.082 --> 20:14.209
Did you see his face?
Did you see the driver?

20:14.284 --> 20:16.149
Nah, he was, like,
hunched over,

20:16.220 --> 20:17.949
like he was on his
cell phone or something.

20:18.388 --> 20:19.855
Cell phone.

20:21.091 --> 20:23.286
He was headed
into the tunnel.

20:23.727 --> 20:25.661
That's why
he turned around.

20:25.729 --> 20:28.664
He didn't want the call
to be interrupted.

20:28.732 --> 20:30.700
What about the van?
What color was it?

20:30.767 --> 20:32.325
I have no idea.

20:33.637 --> 20:36.663
Well, do you remember
anything else?

20:38.408 --> 20:40.706
I have a dentist
appointment tomorrow.

20:40.777 --> 20:42.938
About the van.

20:43.013 --> 20:44.571
You know what,
I think it was, like,

20:44.648 --> 20:46.479
an exterminator van
or something.

20:46.550 --> 20:48.484
Exterminator. Yeah, because I looked up

20:48.552 --> 20:49.883
and it had these
big letters on it.

20:49.953 --> 20:51.250
It said "poison. "

20:51.321 --> 20:52.379
Poison.

20:52.456 --> 20:54.856
Yeah, I remember looking
right at it and saying,

20:54.925 --> 20:56.187
"Poison?"

21:01.398 --> 21:06.665
Okay, this is how we do
our laundry in America.

21:06.904 --> 21:07.962
These are
your whites.

21:08.038 --> 21:10.063
My whites,
excellent.

21:10.140 --> 21:11.801
Your off-whites.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.438
Your off-off-whites.

21:14.912 --> 21:16.538
These are
the primary colors

21:16.612 --> 21:17.704
red,

21:17.780 --> 21:19.111
yellow,

21:19.181 --> 21:20.170
green,

21:20.249 --> 21:21.409
blue,

21:21.484 --> 21:22.917
and that's indigo.

21:22.985 --> 21:25.419
Left socks,
right socks.

21:25.488 --> 21:27.183
I've labeled
them for you.

21:27.256 --> 21:28.314
But in Nigeria,

21:28.391 --> 21:30.484
we just wash
all of our socks together.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.790
Well, I don't like
to judge people,

21:32.862 --> 21:34.329
but that's wrong.

21:34.797 --> 21:36.765
So you mean
you separate everything?

21:36.832 --> 21:38.800
But how much
is that going to cost?

21:38.868 --> 21:40.495
$200.

21:40.603 --> 21:43.128
<i>But I've been watching
the Friends on TV for years.</i>

21:43.205 --> 21:44.968
This is not
how they do it.

21:45.041 --> 21:46.133
What friends?

21:46.208 --> 21:48.108
<i>You know,
the TV show Friends.</i>

21:48.177 --> 21:49.610
Lisa Kudrow?
Jennifer Aniston?

21:50.079 --> 21:53.014
Yeah, oh, we don't get
the African TV here.

21:54.016 --> 21:56.007
I've been looking
at trucks in the street.

21:56.085 --> 21:58.246
None of them
say "poison. "

21:58.321 --> 22:00.585
Yeah, I know.
It doesn't make sense.

22:00.656 --> 22:03.648
Exterminator vans
usually say "pest control,"

22:03.726 --> 22:06.194
or something like that.

22:06.262 --> 22:09.754
I can't figure it out,
but I will.

22:09.832 --> 22:11.493
I know you will.

22:12.101 --> 22:16.060
Excuse me, are you using
all the machines?

22:16.138 --> 22:17.469
That's right.

22:17.540 --> 22:19.098
But they're empty.

22:19.175 --> 22:21.803
That is the pre-wash
cleansing cycle.

22:21.877 --> 22:23.208
The pre-wash what?

22:23.512 --> 22:25.104
The cleansing cycle.

22:25.181 --> 22:26.273
If you are going
to live here,

22:26.349 --> 22:28.873
you should learn
some of the customs.

22:32.120 --> 22:34.213
Did you see that,
with the finger?

22:34.289 --> 22:35.381
What does that mean?

22:35.457 --> 22:36.924
That means
we're number one.

22:36.992 --> 22:38.755
And we should hurry.

22:42.998 --> 22:44.761
Adrian Monk,

22:44.833 --> 22:46.733
he's not an
exterminator.

22:46.801 --> 22:48.632
He's not? He works at a restaurant.

22:48.703 --> 22:51.399
A French restaurant.
The boy made a mistake.

22:51.473 --> 22:53.737
The truck did not
say "poison. "

22:53.808 --> 22:55.469
<i>It said "poisson. "</i>

22:58.980 --> 23:00.242
<i>Poisson.</i>

23:00.749 --> 23:01.841
Fish.

23:02.484 --> 23:03.473
Very good.

23:03.551 --> 23:05.576
Good work, Samuel.

23:06.321 --> 23:08.016
We are gonna get
this man,

23:08.089 --> 23:11.616
and he is going to pay
for what he did to us.

23:11.693 --> 23:13.320
To us?

23:13.395 --> 23:15.886
I mean to you.
What he did to you.

23:30.078 --> 23:32.945
Adrian Monk,
this is the van.

23:34.382 --> 23:37.510
We can't just say that.
We have to be sure.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.417
I am sure.
Look at this light.

23:45.025 --> 23:46.219
It doesn't look new.

23:46.293 --> 23:47.760
Exactly.

23:47.828 --> 23:49.455
He is diabolical.

23:50.230 --> 23:51.663
He has replaced
the broken headlight

23:51.732 --> 23:53.791
with an old headlight,
not a new one.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.732
It's been
repainted, see?

23:55.803 --> 23:57.031
Maybe.

23:58.138 --> 23:59.298
Maybe.

24:08.315 --> 24:09.782
What is it?

24:30.704 --> 24:33.673
Rice. Ansara was buying
food the night she died.

24:33.741 --> 24:35.971
She bought rice.
I saw the sales receipt.

24:36.343 --> 24:38.311
We have to bring this
to the police.

24:39.146 --> 24:41.239
What? Uh, yeah. I need a bag.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.420
This is the third bowl
you chipped this week.

24:55.495 --> 24:56.792
I don't want to hear
your excuses.

24:56.863 --> 24:58.558
I've been warning
you for a month.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.258
Mr. Nichols, please,
I'll pay for the bowl.

25:00.333 --> 25:01.357
You can take it
out of my pay.

25:01.434 --> 25:02.662
Just tell me
what it's worth.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.566
It's worth a hell
of a lot more than you.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.970
<i>Adiós. You're fired.</i>

25:07.240 --> 25:09.538
You can pick up
your check on Friday.

25:11.778 --> 25:13.803
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.211
The apron.

25:24.757 --> 25:26.622
What does that mean?

25:28.661 --> 25:30.322
He is the guy.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.436
Good morning.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.345
Beautiful.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.545
That's where
she was killed.

25:52.618 --> 25:53.676
Uh-huh.

25:53.753 --> 25:56.347
But there's no marker.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.314
It seems like there should
be a plaque or something.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.323
Monk...

26:04.697 --> 26:06.323
She is not Trudy.

26:08.633 --> 26:10.430
I spoke to Natalie.
She's worried about you.

26:10.502 --> 26:12.094
Yeah, well,
I'm worried about Natalie.

26:12.170 --> 26:13.194
Shut up.

26:13.271 --> 26:14.431
Let me talk.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.031
You and I both know
what's going on here.

26:17.108 --> 26:18.370
You're frustrated.

26:18.443 --> 26:19.967
It's been 12 years
since Trudy.

26:20.045 --> 26:21.239
You're getting
your wires crossed.

26:21.313 --> 26:22.780
We haven't been able
to solve her murder,

26:22.848 --> 26:25.476
so you're fixating on
this case, on this woman.

26:25.550 --> 26:26.812
I'm not fixating.

26:27.586 --> 26:31.147
There's got to be
six dozen flowers here.

26:31.223 --> 26:33.691
Natalie says you've missed
two appointments with Dr. Bell,

26:33.758 --> 26:35.248
and you're not eating.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.624
I'm not hungry.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.526
She also said

26:38.597 --> 26:40.656
that you and your friend
Samuel have a suspect.

26:40.732 --> 26:41.994
Kenneth Nichols.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.557
And you're planning
to go undercover

26:43.635 --> 26:45.967
in his restaurant
to get closer to him?

26:48.139 --> 26:49.663
He's the guy.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.009
Okay, um...

26:53.178 --> 26:55.043
You don't happen
to have any,

26:55.113 --> 26:57.343
oh, I don't know,
say, evidence?

26:57.415 --> 27:00.077
He has a record,
drunk driving.

27:00.151 --> 27:04.281
And we found some
rice on the van.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.324
Some rice?

27:06.391 --> 27:07.858
Well, doesn't he
own a restaurant?

27:07.926 --> 27:09.086
Yes.

27:10.495 --> 27:13.123
Well, it's not exactly
a smoking gun, is it?

27:14.466 --> 27:15.933
I mean, there's rice
all over this town.

27:16.001 --> 27:18.162
It's the
San Francisco treat.

27:20.204 --> 27:21.569
All right,

27:21.639 --> 27:22.663
I'll check
the guy out.

27:22.740 --> 27:23.900
I'm on it.
I promise.

27:23.974 --> 27:26.408
But you, you need
to step back, buddy.

27:26.477 --> 27:28.911
Okay, I was there
12 years ago.

27:28.979 --> 27:30.708
It ate you up.
You were crippled.

27:30.781 --> 27:32.442
You could not
leave your room.

27:33.951 --> 27:36.181
I won't allow that
to happen again.

27:36.253 --> 27:38.084
So promise me

27:38.155 --> 27:40.146
that you'll think hard,

27:40.224 --> 27:43.125
long and hard, before
you do anything stupid.

27:46.964 --> 27:48.522
I promise.

27:48.599 --> 27:50.191
Good.

27:50.267 --> 27:51.859
Have a good day.

28:06.417 --> 28:07.441
Looks good.

28:07.518 --> 28:09.543
What is that?
Is that a speck?

28:09.620 --> 28:11.315
We better make sure.

28:11.388 --> 28:13.379
I need a plate.
Where are the plates?

28:13.457 --> 28:14.549
What have you
been doing?

28:14.625 --> 28:18.686
Well, we did this
fork and this knife.

28:19.196 --> 28:21.357
We've been washing them
American style.

28:21.432 --> 28:23.662
What the hell
does that mean?

28:24.535 --> 28:26.162
What about
the potatoes?

28:26.236 --> 28:27.601
Oh, yeah.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.367
What did you do?

28:31.441 --> 28:34.308
You were just supposed
to peel them.

28:34.377 --> 28:35.867
They look like dice.

28:36.412 --> 28:38.972
American style.

28:39.048 --> 28:40.345
Why do you keep
saying that?

28:40.416 --> 28:41.883
That doesn't make
any sense.

28:41.951 --> 28:42.940
Is there a
problem here?

28:43.019 --> 28:44.281
No, sir.

28:44.354 --> 28:45.821
These are the
new dishwashers.

28:45.888 --> 28:48.083
<i>Monsieur Adrian
and monsieur Samuel.</i>

28:48.157 --> 28:49.920
I was just showing
them the ropes.

28:49.993 --> 28:51.324
Well, they can't be any
worse than the two clowns

28:51.394 --> 28:52.622
we just fired.

28:54.964 --> 28:56.727
Well, I stand corrected.

28:56.799 --> 28:58.664
That's coming out
of your pay.

28:58.735 --> 29:00.430
Listen, I just did a fish
run. When they're done here,

29:00.503 --> 29:01.527
I want you to have them
unload the van.

29:01.604 --> 29:02.593
Will do.

29:02.672 --> 29:04.606
I'll be at the bar
if you need me.

29:05.475 --> 29:07.204
Please don't need me.

29:07.276 --> 29:08.334
You heard the man.

29:10.179 --> 29:11.806
Get back to work!

29:24.060 --> 29:26.426
Adrian Monk.
Adrian Monk.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.561
Tuesday the 17th,
the farmers' market.

29:30.633 --> 29:33.124
Oh, Kenneth picks up
fish and produce every week,

29:33.736 --> 29:35.226
if he's sober enough.

29:35.304 --> 29:36.669
And where is
the farmers' market?

29:36.739 --> 29:39.640
Uh, Vinton Street,
near the wharf.

29:39.709 --> 29:40.937
How far is that
from where...

29:41.010 --> 29:43.240
It's close,
maybe five blocks.

29:43.312 --> 29:44.972
Then the puzzle
is complete.

29:45.047 --> 29:46.981
He was driving back
from the farmers' market.

29:47.049 --> 29:48.175
He's obviously
an alcoholic.

29:48.250 --> 29:49.808
He had been drinking,
and he ran a red light.

29:49.885 --> 29:50.909
Maybe, maybe.

29:50.986 --> 29:52.783
No, not maybe.
Yes, this is what happened.

29:52.854 --> 29:57.257
There's no proof.
Samuel, we need evidence.

30:01.029 --> 30:04.328
When we prove it,
if we prove it,

30:04.399 --> 30:05.730
and you want to...

30:07.202 --> 30:08.965
do something to him,

30:10.472 --> 30:12.064
I'll help you.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.370
Why would you do
this for me?

30:15.410 --> 30:16.672
You didn't even
know her.

30:16.745 --> 30:20.203
Of course I knew her. We
were married for seven years.

30:24.419 --> 30:26.410
What are they
doing here?

30:27.489 --> 30:29.980
Who? John and Carolyn Buxton.

30:30.058 --> 30:31.616
I was just
at their house.

30:31.693 --> 30:34.093
Their maid was killed
two weeks ago.

30:34.162 --> 30:36.653
Adrian Monk,
what is going on?

30:38.934 --> 30:40.663
I don't know.

30:47.075 --> 30:48.565
She was on the phone.

30:48.643 --> 30:50.668
Who was on the phone?
The maid.

30:50.745 --> 30:52.178
The woman
who was killed.

30:52.247 --> 30:54.681
That's why she removed
her earring.

30:56.717 --> 30:59.618
Hello, my name is Adrian.
I'll be your server.

30:59.687 --> 31:01.518
I have your soup.

31:02.857 --> 31:06.020
Uh, we haven't
ordered yet.

31:06.093 --> 31:09.324
I just assumed you
wanted soup. Was I right?

31:09.396 --> 31:12.661
And for the lady,
tiramisu.

31:12.733 --> 31:13.722
Dessert?

31:13.801 --> 31:15.496
Why wait until
the last minute?

31:15.569 --> 31:19.061
I understand you're friends
of my employer, Mr. Nichols.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.132
Yes, we've known
Kenneth for years. Why?

31:22.209 --> 31:23.198
Have we met?

31:23.277 --> 31:25.609
No, no.
I'm new here.

31:25.679 --> 31:27.704
I'm sorry to hear
about your housekeeper.

31:27.781 --> 31:30.511
Someone mentioned that
she was killed recently.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.415
She was bludgeoned
to death.

31:32.486 --> 31:34.784
Is that right?
More coffee?

31:34.855 --> 31:36.618
Hey, wait a minute,
I do know you.

31:36.690 --> 31:38.988
He was there.
He's with the police.

31:39.059 --> 31:40.754
Are you a detective?

31:40.828 --> 31:43.353
Actually, um,
I'm moonlighting.

31:43.430 --> 31:45.125
As a waiter?

31:45.199 --> 31:47.133
Well, uh...

31:47.201 --> 31:48.998
You know our motto,

31:49.069 --> 31:51.003
"To protect
and serve. "

31:51.071 --> 31:53.631
When I'm a cop,
I protect.

31:53.707 --> 31:55.675
At night, I serve.

31:55.743 --> 31:57.267
But it's day.

31:57.344 --> 32:02.077
Exactly. I... I've been
thinking about your case.

32:02.149 --> 32:04.379
The morning you returned
from your trip,

32:04.451 --> 32:06.476
you said you found
your cell phone.

32:06.554 --> 32:09.283
That's right. I forgot to
take it with me to Barbados.

32:09.889 --> 32:10.913
It's no big deal.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.150
But when you got home...

32:12.225 --> 32:14.125
It was lying
on the kitchen counter.

32:14.194 --> 32:15.456
What's this all about?

32:15.528 --> 32:17.257
I'm just tying up
loose ends.

32:17.330 --> 32:18.661
How is that tiramisu?

32:18.731 --> 32:21.757
It's good. Delicious.

32:21.834 --> 32:23.825
Great. I'll tell
the chef.

32:25.905 --> 32:28.339
Oh, yes,
one more thing.

32:28.408 --> 32:30.535
Does Kenneth Nichols have
your cell phone number?

32:30.610 --> 32:32.703
Kenneth? Of course he does.
We talk all the time.

32:33.079 --> 32:35.104
Especially during
baseball season.

32:35.181 --> 32:37.809
They talk after
every game.

32:37.884 --> 32:39.146
May we see
the wine list?

32:40.420 --> 32:41.512
No.

32:46.092 --> 32:47.081
Definitely...

32:48.294 --> 32:49.318
And we can prove it?

32:49.395 --> 32:50.919
We can't prove
he killed Ansara.

32:50.997 --> 32:52.396
But he committed
another murder,

32:52.465 --> 32:55.161
a maid, a housekeeper,
the same night.

32:55.235 --> 32:57.169
Where's the phone?

32:57.237 --> 32:58.568
This way.

33:01.474 --> 33:02.634
Who are you calling?

33:02.709 --> 33:04.108
Captain Stottlemeyer.

33:04.177 --> 33:06.577
We need a copy
of Nichols' phone bill.

33:06.646 --> 33:07.943
That's the smoking gun.

33:08.014 --> 33:11.950
Actually, this is
the smoking gun.

33:15.421 --> 33:17.048
Outside,
the both of you.

33:17.123 --> 33:19.148
I think it's time
for your break.

33:34.674 --> 33:37.006
The smell!
I can't breathe!

33:40.546 --> 33:42.878
I can't get a break.

33:42.949 --> 33:46.112
First the incense,
then the dead housekeeper,

33:46.185 --> 33:48.210
and now this.

33:48.554 --> 33:50.852
Oh, God, it stinks!

33:53.659 --> 33:56.594
It's like
chemical warfare.

33:56.662 --> 33:57.686
Adrian Monk,

33:57.764 --> 34:00.961
will you please stop
talking about the smell?

34:01.034 --> 34:03.935
Sometimes you are like
a big, crying infant.

34:04.003 --> 34:06.563
We have other problems, Adrian Monk.

34:09.509 --> 34:10.998
That's better.

34:11.878 --> 34:13.743
Can I say something?

34:13.813 --> 34:14.871
Is it about
the stink?

34:14.947 --> 34:15.936
No.

34:17.050 --> 34:19.610
Yes! I can't breathe!

34:19.685 --> 34:22.152
No... You just think
of something else.

34:22.221 --> 34:24.712
You said that another woman was killed.

34:25.123 --> 34:27.092
What did you mean?
It stinks in here!

34:27.159 --> 34:29.492
Adrian Monk,
just keep talking.

34:31.297 --> 34:33.196
Here's what happened.

34:33.264 --> 34:35.960
Kenneth Nichols
was driving that night.

34:36.034 --> 34:38.228
He was in this van.

34:38.303 --> 34:40.793
<i>He called his friend
John Buxton,</i>

34:40.871 --> 34:42.635
<i>but Buxton wasn't there.</i>

34:42.706 --> 34:44.902
<i>He was in Barbados
on vacation.</i>

34:46.511 --> 34:48.603
<i>The housekeeper,
Maria Fuentes,</i>

34:48.679 --> 34:50.375
<i>answered his cell phone.</i>

34:50.449 --> 34:51.813
<i>They talked for a minute.</i>

34:51.882 --> 34:53.908
<i>While they were talking...</i>

34:56.154 --> 34:57.143
Ansara.

34:57.222 --> 34:58.450
Trudy.

34:59.558 --> 35:00.718
Trudy.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.050
Adrian Monk,

35:04.396 --> 35:05.920
what happened next?

35:05.997 --> 35:08.295
<i>He hit her,
and kept driving.</i>

35:08.366 --> 35:09.958
Oh, my God,
I just hit somebody.

35:10.035 --> 35:12.026
<i>Maria overheard
everything.</i>

35:12.838 --> 35:14.999
At that point...

35:15.073 --> 35:16.563
She knew too much.

35:16.641 --> 35:19.109
He had to keep her quiet.

35:19.177 --> 35:22.340
So he kept her on the
phone. He kept her talking

35:22.414 --> 35:25.440
while he drove
across town.

35:25.517 --> 35:27.417
I just pulled over,
and she's hurt pretty bad.

35:27.486 --> 35:28.612
But someone's called 911,

35:28.687 --> 35:30.279
and an ambulance
is on the way.

35:30.989 --> 35:33.184
Okay. Hold on.
I have a book here.

35:37.629 --> 35:40.120
Okay, it says
to keep her warm

35:40.198 --> 35:42.166
and keep her head still.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.208
Ansara.

36:01.285 --> 36:02.912
She was a flower.

36:03.587 --> 36:05.316
She was so young.

36:05.389 --> 36:07.357
She was just beginning.

36:12.229 --> 36:14.163
We are turning.

36:14.231 --> 36:16.062
What is happening now?

36:16.133 --> 36:18.431
Now he kills us.

36:18.502 --> 36:19.901
Fine with me.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.460
We must go on.

36:21.539 --> 36:24.167
Trudy, Ansara,

36:24.241 --> 36:26.573
they would want us
to go on.

36:26.644 --> 36:29.169
They would want us
to be strong.

36:29.246 --> 36:31.737
They are here
with us now.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.544
Do you not feel it?

36:34.385 --> 36:35.875
Not anymore.

36:38.222 --> 36:40.986
Well, I am not
going to give up.

36:41.058 --> 36:42.821
And neither are you.

36:45.262 --> 36:46.627
Samuel...

36:48.499 --> 36:51.468
This is your
final lesson.

36:51.535 --> 36:54.902
This is how we do
things in America.

36:57.775 --> 36:59.901
We cry a lot.

36:59.976 --> 37:01.944
We confuse our dead wife

37:03.213 --> 37:06.546
with other people's
dead wives.

37:08.151 --> 37:09.812
And then we give up.

37:14.624 --> 37:16.615
We're stopping.
That can't be good.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.594
We've got to get
these ropes off.

37:21.397 --> 37:22.455
God.

37:23.766 --> 37:26.098
I have an idea.
I have an idea.

37:26.803 --> 37:28.896
Can you reach
into my pants?

37:37.814 --> 37:39.441
Yes.

37:39.949 --> 37:41.211
My cigarette lighter.

37:41.284 --> 37:42.376
Ah.

37:49.592 --> 37:50.684
I got it. I got it.

37:50.760 --> 37:52.057
Okay.
I got it.

37:52.662 --> 37:54.186
Okay. Okay.

38:02.739 --> 38:04.570
What's that smell?

38:04.641 --> 38:07.337
My flesh,
it's burning.

38:07.410 --> 38:09.071
It stinks.

38:09.145 --> 38:10.373
Sorry.

38:47.282 --> 38:51.116
Look at her! Look at her!
You son of a bitch.

38:51.186 --> 38:52.949
Her name was Ansara.

38:53.021 --> 38:56.252
Say her name. Say it!

38:56.325 --> 38:57.383
Say it!

38:57.459 --> 38:59.086
Ansara. Ansara.

39:04.099 --> 39:06.499
And that's Trudy.
Say her name.

39:06.568 --> 39:07.592
I didn't know her.

39:07.669 --> 39:09.261
Say her name!

39:09.338 --> 39:10.430
I never met her.

39:10.505 --> 39:12.905
Say her name.

39:13.675 --> 39:15.336
All right. Trudy. Trudy.

39:34.254 --> 39:36.245
Here. Oh, what are these?

39:36.322 --> 39:38.017
A goodbye present.

39:38.091 --> 39:39.490
It's comedy CDs.

39:39.559 --> 39:42.221
It's Richard Pryor,
Monty Python,

39:42.295 --> 39:44.195
Bill Cosby. If you think I'm funny,

39:44.264 --> 39:46.391
these guys are gonna
rock your world.

39:46.466 --> 39:48.661
Thank you.
But I know these guys,

39:48.735 --> 39:51.329
and they are not as funny
as Natalie Teeger.

39:51.404 --> 39:52.735
"Two bags a day. "

39:52.806 --> 39:55.036
How do you do it?

39:55.108 --> 39:57.303
I don't know.
I'm just funny.

39:57.377 --> 39:59.106
I am.

40:00.346 --> 40:02.007
I guess this
is goodbye.

40:02.082 --> 40:03.549
There is no such thing.

40:04.617 --> 40:07.142
We will meet again,
Adrian Monk.

40:07.220 --> 40:09.950
Someday you will come
to Africa to visit.

40:13.860 --> 40:15.225
Maybe.

40:15.295 --> 40:17.661
No maybe.
I'm saying yes.

40:17.730 --> 40:20.961
Or you will
come back here.

40:21.034 --> 40:22.831
Either one, we'll see.

40:24.104 --> 40:26.163
We'll see.

40:26.239 --> 40:27.433
Nobody knows.

40:31.945 --> 40:33.469
What's it like?

40:34.214 --> 40:36.443
What is what like?

40:36.515 --> 40:37.846
Knowing.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.288
Knowing is everything.

40:47.993 --> 40:51.121
But your turn will come,
Adrian Monk.

40:51.196 --> 40:52.629
You are next.

40:53.499 --> 40:55.023
Do not give up.

40:56.635 --> 40:57.863
Never.

41:05.010 --> 41:06.671
This is for you.

41:08.780 --> 41:10.179
Thank you.

41:11.250 --> 41:14.310
No man has a greater
friend than Adrian Monk.

41:15.921 --> 41:18.287
No man has a greater
friend than Samuel Waingaya.
