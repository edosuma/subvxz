[ Phone Ringing ]

00:05.255 --> 00:07.299
[ Woman ] Good morning.
South Philadelphia Animal Shelter.

00:07.382 --> 00:10.969
Yes, hello. | would like to
apply for an adoption, please.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.513
Uh, what are you guys
talking about?

00:12.596 --> 00:15.015
[ Sighs ] We're adopting
a dog-fighting pit bull.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.725
We're gonna keep it
in the bar, all right?

00:16.808 --> 00:18.685
Well, why wasn't I consulted
about this?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.479
Because last time we tried
to get a junkyard dog,

00:20.562 --> 00:22.022
we wound up
getting a junkyard cat,

00:22.105 --> 00:23.732
and that's exactly where
you're gonna go with it.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.235
Yeah, because I don't want
some goddamn snarling hellhound...

00:26.318 --> 00:27.986
running around
inside of our bar.

00:28.070 --> 00:31.031
- Are you crazy?
- Look, we're going to rehabilitate the dog, okay?

00:31.114 --> 00:32.950
We don't want it
to attack other dogs.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.785
Now we would like for it
to attack people.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.328
[ Charlie ]
If it attacks a person, great.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.372
And, if the dog— or when
the dog— bites a customer,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.624
that person then can go home and
have a great story for their friends.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.125
It's a win-win
for everybody.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.336
You can be, “Dude, I got
bit by a pit bull at a bar.”

00:44.419 --> 00:47.005
Awesome. And if you're an intruder,
you should get bit by a pit bull.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.674
- I don't understand.
- See, the biggest—

00:48.799 --> 00:50.801
Uh, how long do you think this
process usually ta— [ Line Clicks ]

00:50.884 --> 00:53.470

hung up on me, for some reason.

Come here. Come here.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.062
Wait for me
in the back-back.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.981
Okay, babe.

01:06.316 --> 01:07.818
Hey, who's that?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.904
I's my new girlfriend—
Roxy.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.782
Mmm. Now that woman
seems like a prostitute.

01:13.865 --> 01:15.617
That's because she is.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.160
You're dating a prostitute?

01:17.244 --> 01:19.413
Not for long.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.456
I'm gonna make
that whore my wife.

Oh, yeah!

Oh, no.

Are they—
Oh, no.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.740
[ Roxy ]
Yeah!

01:54.823 --> 01:56.950
You did not just
do that. Oh, ho, ho.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.286
[ Laughing ] That-That
broad is a live wire.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.163
[ Roxy Laughs ] [ Frank ] Whoo!

02:01.246 --> 02:04.541
I"m goin' outside, 'cause
this place is a shithole.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.002
What are you cocks
lookin' at?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.006
Frank,

02:11.089 --> 02:13.050
that woman is unspeakably crass.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.384
You're gonna marry that,
Frank?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.054
She's been my number-one
girl for a long while now,

02:17.137 --> 02:19.139
but she's still
plowing other dudes.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.017
In fact, Tiger Woods
has been calling her lately.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.061
No, no, no. Hey, bullshit.
That can't be the truth.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.772
There is no way that Tiger
Woods is interested in that woman.

02:26.855 --> 02:29.524
Look, can't you find someone
who loves you for who you are?

02:29.608 --> 02:31.401
That woman's only in it
for the money.

02:31.485 --> 02:32.986
Mm-mmm.
Let me stop you real quick.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.113
Someone love Frank
for who he is?

02:35.197 --> 02:37.199
Come on. No. He's got
a ton of good qualities.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.784
No, not really.
Yes, he does.

02:38.909 --> 02:41.286
| mean, like what? The other day,
we were hanging out under the bridge.

02:41.370 --> 02:42.954
We found a box of denim,
and I'm, like,

02:43.038 --> 02:44.665
“You know, these look like
good jeans in here.”

02:44.748 --> 02:47.501
And he's, like, “You want
to split it with me, 50-507”

02:47.584 --> 02:50.671
- That's a nice thing to do.
- I wanted you to have half of that denim.

02:50.754 --> 02:52.172
He shared half the jeans.

washing up under bridges.

we boil all our denim.

blowing the busboy from
the restaurant down the street.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.397
This is exactly why
we need that dog.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.523
Let's get that dog.

03:09.606 --> 03:14.194
Mac, you look bad.
Really, really bad.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.863
- What?
- Yeah, is that your shirt or my shirt?

03:16.988 --> 03:19.116
That's, like, way too small
for you. You look fat as shit.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.828
Okay, I'm getting very concerned with
the integrity of our organization here.

It's fat. Frank, you are
talking about marrying hookers.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.921
This is ridiculous.
What's going on with our group?

gonna have this woman hanging around,

Pretty Woman and threw it Roxy's way.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.684

bit harder than we thought.

make some changes in your life, Roxy.

new clothes. Uh-huh.

my second act, you know?

in your second act.

Yeah. We're all in our second
acts. Don't you see that?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.313
And I, for one— | don't
want things to change.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.233
| want them to stay the way they
were, because my first act was awesome.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.901
See, your first act
was shit,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.861
and that's why you're so
desperate for things to be different.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.655
But they rarely ever do
get different.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.907
If anything, God, they get
worse. | mean, look at Mac.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.078

He got salsa on his shirt.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.664
Okay. Here's how things
need to go from here on out.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.208
You gotta deal with this woman,
because I can't handle it. All right?

05:33.291 --> 05:35.252
She made things personal,
and I won't stand for that.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.712
Somebody needs to take care
of Mac, and that's gonna be me,

05:37.796 --> 05:40.173
because his fatness is
starting to affect our entire crew.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.883
Mm-hmm. So I'm
gonna take him with me,

05:41.967 --> 05:44.511

trash bags filled with Mexican foods.

than that, man.

on this date.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.007
This girl does think
she's meeting a millionaire.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.302
Why'd you say that, Charlie?
That... defeats the purpose.

gonna be the millionaire.

You're just like a regular
working stiff to this girl.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.729
She doesn't think
you're a millionaire. Okay?

06:35.812 --> 06:37.439

and I'm, like,

not waste this date.

Why don't you finish the
date with my limo driver?”

You know what I mean?
Smart, Charlie.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.366
She's not gonna be able to
resist an opportunity like that.

This is a good idea.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.751
That first one's done?
Yeah, this batch is done.

'em out. Whoo, baby!

07:07.844 --> 07:09.763

are gonna show you...

07:09.846 --> 07:11.806
the damage that you've
been doing to your body,

will incentivize you...

to finally lose some of this
disgusting weight you've put on.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.233
No, I am gonna
look 20 forever, Mac,

and start harvesting.

Yeah. I was just trying
to— trying to move him.

of time, Rox. Get up!

19:26.040 --> 19:27.500
The bitch is dead.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.043
How could she be dead?

19:29.126 --> 19:31.170
I'm telling you,
her heart popped.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.548
She was smoking crack in the car the
whole way here and also all day long.

19:34.632 --> 19:36.801
- She got no pulse.
- Oh, my God.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.636

think this through, okay?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.270
Dead hooker in my apartment?

19:48.354 --> 19:50.064
That doesn't look good for me.
I'm covered in blood.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.775
| mean, it's not good to have
a dead hooker, right?

19:52.858 --> 19:54.694
It would mess up our
second acts a little bit.

19:54.777 --> 19:57.613
I'll tell you guys something, | smoked
a little crack in the car on the way over.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.657

20:13.003 --> 20:14.672
We call in an anonymous tip.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.257
Someone finds her.
So we're still calling 911-—

20:16.382 --> 20:18.467
Someone finds her and throws
her away. just from a pay phone.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.637
This seems like the best thing to
do, considering the circumstances.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.515
- Frank, what do you think?
- I think Roxy would have wanted it that way.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.016
He would know.
Well, there you go.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.601
Frank would know.
| mean, that's it.
