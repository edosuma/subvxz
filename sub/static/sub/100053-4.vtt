WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.612
Family... what a loaded word.

00:02.912 --> 00:06.130
Whatever we did, whatever
happened, we also created a life.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.508
It's the foundation for everything,

00:08.509 --> 00:09.884
and, like it or not...

00:09.885 --> 00:12.303
I want to come home.
It's not John's baby.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.471
...we don't get to choose.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.806
It's a lot of bags for just the weekend.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.391
Mom, it's just the weekend, right?

00:16.392 --> 00:18.310
I've left your father.

00:18.311 --> 00:20.020
They're all we've got.

00:20.021 --> 00:21.313
After Chad died,

00:21.314 --> 00:23.690
I just so wanted to believe
that he was still here.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.025
That's what Maggie wants.

00:25.026 --> 00:26.652
So, we support them...

00:26.653 --> 00:28.093
I want to take out a line of credit.

00:28.118 --> 00:29.599
I want to give Andrew his money back.

00:29.623 --> 00:31.531
- Let me help you, babe.
- ...forgive them...

00:31.532 --> 00:33.892
I was able to get you a 60-day
extension on the foreclosure.

00:33.916 --> 00:36.245
- You won't lose the house.
- ...and just try...

00:36.246 --> 00:37.371
Maggie.

00:36.372 --> 00:38.206
Did you come to Boston to see me or him?

00:38.207 --> 00:39.999
...not to hurt each other.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.252
What is he doing here?

00:43.504 --> 00:46.381
What makes my mom think it is okay

00:46.382 --> 00:48.716
to bring her boy toy to breakfast?

00:48.717 --> 00:51.052
I mean, what is he doing
hanging out with her anyway?

00:51.053 --> 00:53.304
What does a 35-year-old
want with my mother?

00:54.723 --> 00:57.475
The acronym you're
looking for is M-I-L...

00:57.476 --> 00:59.227
You better be spelling "milk".

00:59.228 --> 01:01.020
Oh, my God. That's worse.

01:01.021 --> 01:02.772
Why didn't you tell Maggie I was coming?

01:02.773 --> 01:04.232
Because I didn't want her to say no.

01:04.233 --> 01:05.900
As soon as she gets to know you...

01:05.901 --> 01:07.701
Patricia, the whole reason
I agreed to be here

01:07.725 --> 01:09.070
was to help you come clean.

01:09.071 --> 01:10.113
And I will.

01:10.114 --> 01:12.365
Just... at the right time.

01:14.118 --> 01:17.495
Which apparently is not right now.

01:16.996 --> 01:18.205
And for the shrimp,

01:18.206 --> 01:20.415
I need 20 pounds of the
21/25s, head on, tail on.

01:20.416 --> 01:22.084
And how much for the Dover sole?

01:22.085 --> 01:24.878
I'm sorry, I-I meant
the price of the fish,

01:24.879 --> 01:26.559
not the gold-plated
yacht that caught them.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.423
Sign here. And here.

01:28.424 --> 01:29.591
H-Hold a sec.

01:29.592 --> 01:31.176
What exactly am I signing?

01:31.177 --> 01:34.596
You're legally agreeing to never
sing "Po-Po-Po-Po-Po-Poker Face"

01:34.597 --> 01:35.639
at karaoke ever again.

01:35.640 --> 01:36.890
People loved that.

01:36.891 --> 01:38.851
Sweetie, people were
clapping because it was over.

01:38.875 --> 01:41.061
It's your line of credit application

01:41.062 --> 01:43.104
so you can buy out Andrew.

01:43.105 --> 01:44.314
Mm-hmm.

01:45.817 --> 01:49.319
Hey, you said the Alaskan
salmon was on sale, right?

01:49.320 --> 01:52.906
Yeah, let's do 20 pounds of
that instead of the sole.

01:51.907 --> 01:54.408
Okay, great. Thanks.

01:58.997 --> 02:01.582
You know you got this, right?

02:01.583 --> 02:02.750
Mm-hmm.

02:02.751 --> 02:05.211
We just need to be resourceful,

02:05.212 --> 02:07.672
especially while paying Andrew back.

02:07.673 --> 02:09.090
Which we will do in no time

02:09.091 --> 02:11.551
now that I'm directing
these Lexus commercials.

02:11.552 --> 02:14.262
Thank you so much for doing this.

02:14.263 --> 02:16.097
I know it's a sacrifice.

02:16.098 --> 02:18.057
Well, it's not a sacrifice, Lady Gaga.

02:18.058 --> 02:19.433
I'm betting on you.

02:19.434 --> 02:22.019
Mm.

02:21.520 --> 02:22.937
And my po-po-po-po...

02:22.938 --> 02:24.606
- Please don't do that.
- ...po...

02:24.607 --> 02:26.149
Don't do that. Don't do that.

02:26.150 --> 02:27.317
Come on.

02:27.318 --> 02:29.235
Dad, hummus?

02:29.236 --> 02:31.071
Really? We talked about this.

02:31.072 --> 02:32.989
Hey, Eddie? Um, I'm
probably gonna be swamped

02:32.990 --> 02:34.324
catching up at work today.

02:34.325 --> 02:36.786
Do you mind if we switch?
I can do drop-off.

02:38.329 --> 02:40.580
Uh, yeah. We can, but...

02:40.581 --> 02:42.999
Mom, we can't forget the present.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.460
- I'll be right back.
- Present?

02:45.461 --> 02:47.545
Today's the day Theo and
I were gonna drop off

02:47.546 --> 02:49.422
the present that he bought for the baby.

02:50.424 --> 02:52.008
Oh, right.

02:52.009 --> 02:53.176
Uh...

02:53.177 --> 02:55.637
I'll... I'll do the pickup.

02:55.638 --> 02:57.639
No. We all have to go.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.933
The gift's from the family.

02:59.934 --> 03:02.143
Mom, don't you want to meet the baby?

03:03.646 --> 03:05.939
I sure do. Come on.

03:05.940 --> 03:07.399
Let's go meet this baby.

03:07.400 --> 03:09.401
Yes.

03:13.928 --> 03:18.928

03:18.894 --> 03:20.729
You see the little notches here?

03:20.730 --> 03:23.481
It tells you exactly how
much formula you have to...

03:23.482 --> 03:25.567
Sorry. Obviously, you see
that there are numbers.

03:25.568 --> 03:27.861
- You mean, like, the two and the three?
- Yeah.

03:27.862 --> 03:29.487
Yeah. But thank you for momsplaining.

03:29.488 --> 03:30.905
Sorry. It's just...

03:30.906 --> 03:34.034
I think I feel a little guilty
going back to work so soon.

03:34.035 --> 03:35.785
I mean, I want to be there for Gina.

03:35.786 --> 03:37.037
It's just that...

03:37.038 --> 03:39.078
D, Jon didn't leave that
restaurant just for Regina.

03:39.102 --> 03:40.415
He left it to the both of you.

03:40.416 --> 03:42.709
He wanted you to have it.

03:42.710 --> 03:44.794
Yeah, I know.

03:44.795 --> 03:46.504
I know. And I want that, too.

03:46.505 --> 03:48.298
It's just that now I have Charlie.

03:48.299 --> 03:49.924
Who's gonna thank you some day

03:49.925 --> 03:52.260
for showing her how to
be a badass working mom.

03:52.261 --> 03:55.472
With a little stitch of
spit-up on her sweater.

03:55.473 --> 03:57.515
Oh.

03:57.516 --> 03:59.225
- Shh, shh.
- Hey.

03:59.226 --> 04:00.366
- Hi.
- Sorry, we didn't want

04:00.390 --> 04:01.811
to ring the bell in case we woke...

04:01.812 --> 04:03.021
Charlie!

04:03.022 --> 04:04.564
Hey! Hi!

04:04.565 --> 04:06.232
Oh, gosh. You're so wet.

04:06.233 --> 04:07.859
Hey.

04:07.860 --> 04:10.321
I... I'm so glad you
guys could all come.

04:11.489 --> 04:13.448
Mom, look.

04:13.449 --> 04:15.992
Her feet are so little.

04:15.993 --> 04:17.535
Cute.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.292
Oh, hey, man.

04:24.293 --> 04:26.127
I... didn't know you were gonna be here.

04:26.128 --> 04:27.128
Yeah.

04:27.129 --> 04:28.755
D asked me to babysit.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.549
Oh.

04:31.550 --> 04:33.885
Yeah, y-y-you know what?

04:33.886 --> 04:35.720
Uh, dude, you should join.

04:35.721 --> 04:37.055
I-I could use the help.

04:37.056 --> 04:38.807
- Mm-hmm.
- Right? I mean, that's if...

04:38.808 --> 04:40.392
that... that's if you're not busy,

04:40.393 --> 04:41.810
but you guys are probably busy.

04:41.811 --> 04:43.812
I didn't say nothing.
I didn't say nothing.

04:43.813 --> 04:45.573
That's... Forget what
I said. What did I say?

04:45.097 --> 04:46.857
- I said nothing.
- Theo, wait, wait.

04:46.858 --> 04:48.358
- Is this for Charlie?
- Yes.

04:49.527 --> 04:51.528
Should we go open it
right now in the nursery?

04:51.529 --> 04:53.810
- Yes. Let's do that. Okay.
- I love a good nursery.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.532
Baby town.

04:55.533 --> 04:57.253
Where is that nursery?

04:57.254 --> 04:59.014
I'm shutting up. I'm
gonna shut up right now.

04:59.038 --> 05:00.287
I'm not saying another word.

05:00.288 --> 05:03.373
- You should stay.
- I know.

05:03.374 --> 05:05.542
Spend some time with her.

05:05.543 --> 05:06.919
Are you sure?

05:06.920 --> 05:09.421
I'm sure.

05:11.883 --> 05:13.717
Oh, thank you.

05:13.718 --> 05:15.385
Learn from my mistakes, people.

05:15.386 --> 05:19.056
Do not go past 6 on that toaster.

05:20.058 --> 05:22.059
And yet, when you have
two pieces in there,

05:22.060 --> 05:23.060
i-it's totally fine.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.311
It's the weirdest thing.

05:24.312 --> 05:25.952
- That's so weird.
- So weird, yeah.

05:25.976 --> 05:27.898
You know? Two pieces.

05:27.899 --> 05:31.693
â™ª

05:31.694 --> 05:34.947
Eric has, uh, a music
store on Beacon Hill

05:34.948 --> 05:36.907
called "A Guitar Is Born".

05:36.908 --> 05:38.428
Sort of a play on words.

05:38.452 --> 05:40.702
- It's cute, right?
- It's very cute.

05:40.703 --> 05:42.583
Well, it's not that cute, it's...

05:42.607 --> 05:44.873
Maggie plays the piano, so...

05:44.874 --> 05:47.042
I haven't played in years, Mom.

05:47.043 --> 05:49.461
Alright, yeah, this music
talk is super fun,

05:49.462 --> 05:51.088
but, uh, if it's not too much trouble,

05:51.089 --> 05:52.547
could you tell us the story

05:52.548 --> 05:54.383
of how you started dating my mother?

05:54.384 --> 05:55.864
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:55.865 --> 05:57.283
Honey, honey, honey, we're not...

05:57.284 --> 05:58.679
- Yeah.
- That's... That's...

05:58.680 --> 06:00.280
- Definitely not. Uh... That's...
- Yeah.

06:00.304 --> 06:03.392
Then... what's going on?

06:03.393 --> 06:05.645
Honey, um...

06:07.272 --> 06:08.564
Eric...

06:18.408 --> 06:20.284
Honey, there's something
that you need to know

06:20.285 --> 06:21.952
about the night Chad died.

06:24.247 --> 06:27.499
Uh, what does that have to do with him?

06:28.876 --> 06:30.627
Everything.

06:31.963 --> 06:34.339
Eric has your brother's heart.

06:41.142 --> 06:42.976
No. What are you talking...

06:42.977 --> 06:45.770
Th... Chad died the moment
his car hit the tree.

06:45.771 --> 06:47.355
That's...

06:48.858 --> 06:50.900
That's what you told me.

06:53.404 --> 06:55.196
Mom?

06:55.197 --> 06:58.283
I need you to tell me

06:58.284 --> 07:01.036
exactly what happened that night.

07:01.037 --> 07:03.288
I was, um...

07:03.289 --> 07:07.125
I was home alone when I got the call.

07:07.126 --> 07:08.710
Dad was working late.

07:08.711 --> 07:13.256
They told me Chad was in an accident,

07:13.257 --> 07:16.134
but they wouldn't tell me
any more over the phone.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.656
Eugene, you've got to go get Maggie...

07:17.680 --> 07:19.054
I called your father from the car.

07:19.055 --> 07:20.680
You were at the movies.

07:20.681 --> 07:23.349
We agreed... I would go to the hospital,

07:23.350 --> 07:25.060
he would go and get you.

07:25.061 --> 07:27.020
I was met by a doctor.

07:27.021 --> 07:28.563
Uh, I'm looking for my son.

07:28.564 --> 07:30.523
"Traumatic brain injury".

07:30.524 --> 07:32.317
That's what he told me.

07:32.318 --> 07:35.111
Apparently, Chad wasn't
wearing his seatbelt.

07:35.112 --> 07:37.197
He was thrown from the car.

07:40.076 --> 07:43.912
He said that they tried to
do everything they could,

07:43.913 --> 07:47.207
but Chad was going to die.

07:47.208 --> 07:50.085
He asked me what I wanted to do.

07:50.086 --> 07:52.879
I had to make the decision so quickly.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.007
I just didn't want my
son to die in vain.

07:56.050 --> 07:58.093
Honey, it was too late for him,

07:58.094 --> 08:01.555
but it was not too
late for someone else.

08:02.057 --> 08:04.892
After I made the decision,

08:04.893 --> 08:07.312
I asked to see Chad.

08:07.313 --> 08:09.230
You saw him?

08:12.818 --> 08:14.319
He was alive.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.904
Barely.

08:19.617 --> 08:21.367
And how long...

08:21.368 --> 08:22.994
Not long.

08:22.995 --> 08:26.289
I really think he was holding on

08:26.290 --> 08:27.749
until one of us could get there.

08:36.592 --> 08:38.802
Why didn't you tell me?

08:38.803 --> 08:40.804
Because by the time
you and Dad got there,

08:40.804 --> 08:42.765
Chad was gone.

08:42.765 --> 08:45.559
I didn't want you to regret

08:45.560 --> 08:48.145
missing the chance to say goodbye.

08:48.146 --> 08:51.732
I didn't want you to know that...

08:51.733 --> 08:54.610
that he had suffered.

08:56.780 --> 08:59.031
Uh, so, you lied to me.

08:59.032 --> 09:01.533
You lied to us.

09:00.534 --> 09:01.868
To protect you.

09:01.869 --> 09:03.536
No, that wasn't your choice to make.

09:03.537 --> 09:05.330
I should have known how my brother died.

09:05.331 --> 09:07.040
- I didn't...
- For the last six years,

09:07.041 --> 09:09.376
I've been walking around with
a story that's not even true.

09:12.046 --> 09:14.756
God, why are you even telling me now?

09:23.849 --> 09:26.059
Him.

09:26.561 --> 09:27.979
Maggie...

09:27.980 --> 09:30.481
'Cause he makes you feel better.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.483
Well, Mom,

09:32.484 --> 09:37.029
I am so glad you feel better.

09:40.367 --> 09:41.451
Maggie.

09:43.370 --> 09:44.913
Excuse me.

09:51.628 --> 09:53.879
Maggie!

09:53.880 --> 09:55.923
Maggie! Wait up!

09:56.967 --> 09:59.802
No, from the moment he died,

09:59.803 --> 10:02.388
she's been lying to me about everything,

10:02.389 --> 10:03.639
and now I feel like

10:03.640 --> 10:05.349
I have to bury him all over again.

10:05.350 --> 10:06.892
- Maggie, come on.
- I know.

10:06.893 --> 10:08.227
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:08.228 --> 10:09.311
I just...

10:08.812 --> 10:10.813
I need to be alone right now.

10:17.696 --> 10:20.615
How is she?

10:20.616 --> 10:22.033
Is she okay?

10:22.034 --> 10:24.536
Um... I'm so sorry.

10:24.537 --> 10:25.870
I...

10:25.871 --> 10:27.330
This is not on you, man.

10:26.331 --> 10:29.458
All you did was need a heart, alright?

10:29.459 --> 10:32.836
Oh, I don't know why I
expected this to go any better.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.005
Than what?

10:42.722 --> 10:44.223
Oh, my God.

10:44.224 --> 10:46.100
What?

10:46.101 --> 10:47.309
Patricia...

10:47.310 --> 10:53.148
you told us that you left Eugene.

10:55.694 --> 10:58.279
Well, Eugene doesn't understand.

11:00.032 --> 11:01.032
Oh, my God.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.534
He saw my e-mails to you.

11:03.535 --> 11:05.244
Uh...

11:05.245 --> 11:08.372
I tried to tell him that
this was a good thing.

11:08.373 --> 11:11.209
Part of Chad is still alive.

11:11.210 --> 11:13.753
But he doesn't see it that way.

11:13.754 --> 11:17.090
He just kept saying, "My son is dead.

11:16.591 --> 11:18.341
That is not my son".

11:18.342 --> 11:20.885
So, he gave me an ultimatum...

11:20.886 --> 11:22.304
Him or...

11:22.305 --> 11:24.264
Or me.

11:25.808 --> 11:28.059
I-I never should've, um...

11:28.060 --> 11:30.312
Yeah, coming here was a mistake.

11:30.313 --> 11:31.396
I, uh...

11:32.982 --> 11:35.066
Just tell Maggie I'm sorry.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.192
Eric...

11:40.865 --> 11:44.326
Dad, hold Charlie so
she can see the concert.

11:44.327 --> 11:45.535
Mm.

11:45.536 --> 11:50.957
â™ª Ccount on me like one, two, three â™ª

11:50.958 --> 11:54.294
â™ª I'll be there â™ª

11:54.295 --> 11:58.006
â™ª And I know when I need it I can â™ª

11:58.007 --> 12:03.470
â™ª Count on you like four, three, two â™ª

12:02.971 --> 12:06.473
â™ª You'll be there â™ª

12:06.474 --> 12:12.146
â™ª 'Cause that's what friends
are supposed to do, oh, yeah â™ª

12:12.147 --> 12:14.731
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

12:14.732 --> 12:19.444
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

12:18.945 --> 12:22.782
â™ª Yeah â™ª

12:22.783 --> 12:24.408
â™ª Yeah â™ª

12:24.409 --> 12:25.701
Hey, Theo? Five more minutes?

12:25.702 --> 12:27.119
I got to take you to school, okay?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.288
Okay.

12:29.289 --> 12:30.998
Hey.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.502
I got it.

12:35.003 --> 12:37.505
Katherine. Wait.

12:37.506 --> 12:39.340
I know how hard this must be.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.509
- Just, please...
- Don't.

12:41.510 --> 12:43.636
Don't pretend you have any idea

12:43.637 --> 12:45.971
what I'm going through.

12:50.646 --> 12:52.304
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the Dover sole?

12:52.329 --> 12:54.232
I decided to change things up.

12:54.233 --> 12:55.775
Thought we could do a salmon special

12:55.776 --> 12:56.819
instead of the sole.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.696
Also, it was half the price.

12:59.697 --> 13:01.198
Copy that. Salmon special.

13:01.199 --> 13:02.365
- I love it.
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.450
Thank you.

13:03.451 --> 13:05.660
Okay. We could do, like, a miso glaze,

13:05.661 --> 13:08.121
or we could do that crusted... pecan...

13:08.122 --> 13:09.206
Albert.

13:09.207 --> 13:10.874
Shutting up, Chef.

13:10.875 --> 13:12.667
Oh.

13:12.668 --> 13:14.044
These the reservations?

13:14.045 --> 13:16.004
How the numbers looking for tonight?

13:16.005 --> 13:17.964
Oh. Not great.

13:17.965 --> 13:20.092
But maybe we'll get some walk-ins.

13:21.594 --> 13:23.303
Yeah, maybe.

13:28.102 --> 13:29.727
- D?
- Yeah.

13:29.728 --> 13:32.188
Our big party canceled
because of the rain.

13:32.189 --> 13:33.982
Come on. This is Boston.

13:33.983 --> 13:35.608
We get 50 inches of snow a year.

13:35.609 --> 13:37.569
We can handle a little bit of rain.

13:37.593 --> 13:39.112
And it's just getting worse.

13:39.113 --> 13:40.321
It's gonna be fine.

13:40.322 --> 13:42.449
It's just one day.

13:42.450 --> 13:43.741
Is it?

13:44.743 --> 13:46.453
What if Andrew was right?

13:46.454 --> 13:50.039
What if this place is doomed to fail?

13:50.040 --> 13:52.584
It's not.

13:52.585 --> 13:54.627
Yeah, okay, well, that's
easy for you to say, D,

13:54.628 --> 13:56.796
because I am the one
in the driver's seat.

13:56.297 --> 13:58.298
Excuse me?

13:58.299 --> 14:01.468
If we fail, it is all on me.

14:02.971 --> 14:05.263
Gina, we're not gonna fail.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.811
Oh, my God. Could you imagine?

14:10.812 --> 14:13.146
We'd be so screwed.

14:13.147 --> 14:15.440
Seriously.

14:17.235 --> 14:19.111
Hey, guys?

14:19.112 --> 14:21.530
I think the power's out.

14:20.531 --> 14:21.864
Just got off the phone with D.

14:21.865 --> 14:23.867
Apparently, power's out
at the restaurant, too.

14:24.910 --> 14:26.786
This morning, man, that was, uh...

14:26.787 --> 14:27.912
Complicated.

14:27.913 --> 14:29.789
I would have went with
"awkward as hell",

14:29.790 --> 14:31.541
but "complicated" works.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.084
How's all that going?

14:33.085 --> 14:35.128
Oh, you know, super good,

14:34.629 --> 14:37.005
considering I just had a
child with another woman

14:37.006 --> 14:38.965
as I'm trying to patch
things up with my wife.

14:38.966 --> 14:40.383
Yes, he did.

14:40.384 --> 14:43.386
Yes, he did. Daddy did do that.

14:43.387 --> 14:44.971
Okay, thank you.

14:44.972 --> 14:47.641
Alright, apparently a tree
came down in Porter Square.

14:47.642 --> 14:49.726
Some lines are down. It's
gonna take a while to fix.

14:49.727 --> 14:51.978
Seems there's lines
down across the city.

14:51.979 --> 14:53.563
Great.

14:53.064 --> 14:54.481
Without power,

14:54.482 --> 14:57.259
that's thousands of dollars
of meat and produce gone.

14:57.260 --> 14:58.343
No, it's cool. I'll hustle the staff,

14:58.367 --> 14:59.403
we'll get everything into the walk-in.

14:59.404 --> 15:00.724
We'll empty all the ice machines,

15:00.748 --> 15:03.376
try and keep it as cool
as we can in there.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.035
Thanks, Albert.

15:06.036 --> 15:08.620
Okay, alright, kitchen staff,
let's listen up, please.

15:08.621 --> 15:10.301
I need everything
wrapped and off the line.

15:10.302 --> 15:11.782
I only want to open the freezer once.

15:11.806 --> 15:13.166
Please, if you guys could file in.

15:13.190 --> 15:14.877
I need all the ice from the bar cooler.

15:14.878 --> 15:16.628
I need ice from wherever you can get it.

15:16.629 --> 15:18.672
We got to get everything cold.

15:19.300 --> 15:20.842
A blackout?

15:20.843 --> 15:22.844
I can't believe this.

15:22.845 --> 15:24.471
You know, I...

15:24.472 --> 15:26.139
gave Neil's money away.

15:26.140 --> 15:28.308
I finally let go of Andrew,

15:28.309 --> 15:30.477
took a loan out on my home,

15:30.478 --> 15:33.521
and now this?

15:33.522 --> 15:34.522
You're not alone.

15:34.523 --> 15:36.399
What are you trying to tell me?

15:36.400 --> 15:39.110
If this isn't a sign from God...

15:39.111 --> 15:41.446
This is a sign. This is Him
trying to tell me something.

15:41.447 --> 15:43.698
Oh, Gina, this isn't
just happening to you.

15:44.950 --> 15:47.243
Alright, it's happening to
both of us. I'm your partner.

15:47.244 --> 15:49.537
- Yeah, I know that, D.
- Do you?

15:48.538 --> 15:50.623
'Cause you're not acting like it.

15:50.624 --> 15:52.750
I'm here for you, and I need this.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.919
I need this just as much as you do.

16:02.969 --> 16:04.762
Um, sorry.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.222
We're closed.

16:06.223 --> 16:08.432
Oh. It's really coming down out there.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.309
Think I can dry off for a few?

16:10.310 --> 16:11.977
Sure.

16:11.978 --> 16:13.562
Thank you.

16:19.945 --> 16:22.863
Hey, you hungry?

16:22.864 --> 16:24.448
I mean, I could eat.

16:24.449 --> 16:26.117
Cool.

16:26.118 --> 16:28.202
Have a seat.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.473
Damn it, Maggie.

16:56.816 --> 16:58.901
Maggie!

16:58.902 --> 17:01.195
Get in!

17:01.196 --> 17:04.156
It's pouring.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.076
Please.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.088
Hey, leave out a few of those clams.

17:19.089 --> 17:20.839
Yes, Chef.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.622
And grab me some Pinot Gris
from the bar when you're done.

17:22.646 --> 17:25.397
Right away.

17:29.892 --> 17:32.102
You gonna let me in on whatever this is?

17:32.103 --> 17:35.523
This is me hearing my partner.

17:36.565 --> 17:38.984
Did I ever tell you about my first job?

17:38.985 --> 17:41.319
It's actually where Albert and I met.

17:40.820 --> 17:43.947
It was this little Italian
restaurant in Somerville.

17:43.948 --> 17:45.532
I was 16.

17:45.533 --> 17:47.701
Started off as a dishwasher.

17:47.702 --> 17:50.329
I'd help the cooks with
whatever they needed...

17:50.330 --> 17:53.707
uh, peeling potatoes, chopping onions.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.752
I'd come in early, stay late, and...

17:57.338 --> 17:58.505
You know what?

17:58.506 --> 18:01.174
I think I just wanted to
get out of the house...

18:01.175 --> 18:03.718
after everything that happened.

18:03.719 --> 18:05.136
Mm.

18:05.137 --> 18:07.013
So, every day before our shift,

18:07.014 --> 18:08.556
we'd have a family meal.

18:08.557 --> 18:10.433
They'd cook this massive feast

18:10.434 --> 18:13.144
from whatever was left
over from the day before,

18:13.145 --> 18:15.688
and we'd... we'd drag
these tables together.

18:15.689 --> 18:17.732
They'd...

18:17.233 --> 18:20.193
They would make this
horrible screeching sound.

18:21.696 --> 18:23.363
But to me, that sound was everything

18:23.364 --> 18:25.782
because for 25 minutes, every day,

18:25.783 --> 18:28.535
this random group of misfits and nomads

18:28.536 --> 18:30.996
would sit together and share a meal.

18:30.997 --> 18:34.708
For that 25 minutes,
they were my family.

18:36.210 --> 18:38.045
Hmm.

18:38.046 --> 18:40.297
From your buddy up front.

18:40.298 --> 18:42.818
If you're gonna cook in the dark,
you might as well do it right.

18:42.842 --> 18:43.967
Alright.

18:43.968 --> 18:45.552
What is that?

18:45.553 --> 18:46.762
Hey.

18:46.763 --> 18:47.763
Whoo!

18:47.764 --> 18:49.765
- Hey, she's back.
- Mm-hmm.

18:51.309 --> 18:52.893
What?

18:52.394 --> 18:55.312
Oh, if I could, I'd take back

18:55.313 --> 18:57.147
all the harm I caused this past year,

18:57.148 --> 18:59.775
but not you, Charlotte.

18:59.776 --> 19:01.610
Mnh-mnh.

19:01.611 --> 19:05.197
You are the one good
thing to come out of it.

19:07.784 --> 19:09.827
VoilÃƒÂ .

19:09.828 --> 19:11.620
Wow.

19:11.621 --> 19:14.832
You know, I would've
settled for just a sandwich.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.292
Hmm. I wouldn't have.

19:17.528 --> 19:19.570
You know, call your crew.

19:19.071 --> 19:21.281
- There's more where that came from.
- Oh.

19:21.282 --> 19:23.658
Well, in that case,
you'll still need this.

19:23.659 --> 19:24.993
Thank you.

19:26.538 --> 19:27.978
- Gary.
- Have you seen Maggie?

19:28.002 --> 19:30.124
I thought she might come
here to talk to you.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.792
No. Why? Is everything okay?

19:31.793 --> 19:34.044
No.

19:35.296 --> 19:37.297
Oh, welcome back, stranger.

19:37.298 --> 19:38.298
Quick update...

19:38.299 --> 19:40.426
we filed an extension
on the Madigan case,

19:40.427 --> 19:43.178
I lost eight pounds, uh,
the new temp is super cute,

19:43.179 --> 19:44.680
but straight... for now...

19:44.681 --> 19:46.433
and did I mention I lost eight pounds?

19:47.475 --> 19:49.727
Yeah, you lost eight
pounds. That's great.

19:49.228 --> 19:51.521
But I gained five of them back
from the stress of it all.

19:51.522 --> 19:52.939
I was worried about you.

19:52.940 --> 19:55.024
Where have you been?

19:56.360 --> 19:59.696
Woman, please, when have
you ever not confided in me?

20:00.823 --> 20:02.699
- Come on.
- This should be good.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.034
...Only to discover

20:04.035 --> 20:06.536
that she didn't even take her phone.

20:06.537 --> 20:08.038
So, I have no idea where she is,

20:08.039 --> 20:09.372
no way to get ahold of her,

20:09.373 --> 20:11.013
even if she did want
to talk to me, and...

20:11.037 --> 20:12.237
Whoop.

20:13.044 --> 20:15.336
Patricia keeps texting her.

20:15.337 --> 20:18.048
It's not gonna happen, Trish.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.633
I just don't understand

20:19.634 --> 20:23.262
how she could do all of
this to her own daughter.

20:23.263 --> 20:25.682
I can.

20:28.226 --> 20:31.311
That's exactly what I'm
doing to Sophie and Danny.

20:31.312 --> 20:32.437
Um...

20:32.438 --> 20:35.065
unless you've secretly
harvested Danny's organs,

20:35.066 --> 20:36.191
I don't think it is.

20:36.192 --> 20:38.026
Alright, look, I'll tell you this...

20:37.527 --> 20:39.528
as a mom, the moment your kids are born,

20:39.529 --> 20:41.405
you're just hard-wired to protect them.

20:41.406 --> 20:42.656
Not my mother.

20:42.657 --> 20:44.950
She never protected anything,
except maybe her SAG card.

20:46.119 --> 20:47.912
I'm not saying that
what she did is right,

20:47.913 --> 20:50.456
I just understand how in that moment...

20:50.457 --> 20:52.875
she just didn't want Maggie to know

20:52.876 --> 20:54.919
her brother had suffered.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.884
You know, uh...

21:00.885 --> 21:03.595
you... you have to know
the last thing I wanted

21:03.596 --> 21:05.639
was to come between you and your family.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.518
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

21:09.519 --> 21:11.834
we have been dysfunctional
for quite some time.

21:11.859 --> 21:13.005
Oh, good.

21:20.321 --> 21:25.117
After Chad died, um...

21:25.118 --> 21:27.994
we were never really the same.

21:27.995 --> 21:32.207
My mom, she was, um...

21:32.208 --> 21:33.667
she was stuck.

21:33.668 --> 21:37.379
She... kept his room exactly how it was,

21:37.380 --> 21:39.714
like a shrine...

21:39.215 --> 21:43.344
and she just kind of walled
herself off from everyone...

21:43.345 --> 21:45.095
including me.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.351
Especially me.

21:58.194 --> 22:00.278
Uh, Gary, wh... what are you doing here?

22:00.279 --> 22:02.072
Well, I got your message.

22:02.073 --> 22:05.200
Uh... Technically, Maggie's message.

22:06.285 --> 22:08.244
So, she hasn't seen any of my texts?

22:08.245 --> 22:10.330
- No.
- Oh.

22:10.331 --> 22:12.707
Come in, come in.

22:14.794 --> 22:16.836
It's probably for the best.

22:16.837 --> 22:19.547
I don't think she wants to talk to you.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.049
Or me, or...

22:21.050 --> 22:23.176
anyone, for that matter.

22:23.177 --> 22:25.095
Not for nothing.

22:25.096 --> 22:27.514
She kind of got a bomb dropped on her

22:27.015 --> 22:29.058
over bagels, so...

22:30.268 --> 22:32.144
- ...there's that.
- Oh.

22:32.145 --> 22:34.355
What have I done?

22:35.899 --> 22:38.025
I mean...

22:38.026 --> 22:43.030
everybody hates me...
my husband, my daughter.

22:43.031 --> 22:45.825
Now... Eric.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.710
Patricia...

22:55.711 --> 22:59.547
what you and Eugene went through...

22:59.548 --> 23:03.342
losing a child...

23:02.843 --> 23:05.304
I cannot imagine.

23:07.806 --> 23:11.017
I do get that it brings you comfort

23:11.018 --> 23:15.772
knowing that some part
of Chad is still alive.

23:17.274 --> 23:19.734
But your husband...

23:21.237 --> 23:24.739
...he's not wrong.

23:24.740 --> 23:27.659
Eric is not your son,

23:27.660 --> 23:31.663
and all of this...

23:31.664 --> 23:35.625
him...

23:35.626 --> 23:37.835
is it really worth losing your family?

23:40.339 --> 23:43.074
What if it's too late?

23:44.135 --> 23:47.136
Well, there's only one way to find out.

23:47.137 --> 23:49.347
Pick up the phone, Patricia.

23:49.348 --> 23:52.267
You just said Maggie
doesn't want to talk to me.

23:52.268 --> 23:55.979
That is not who you need to call.

24:02.260 --> 24:04.466
I don't get it. She's dry,
she's fed, she's burped.

24:04.566 --> 24:06.733
Could be an ear infection.
What? That's a thing, right?

24:06.734 --> 24:08.760
Ear infection? Yes, that's a thing,
but she's not touching her ears.

24:08.761 --> 24:10.161
We're the worst babysitters ever.

24:10.162 --> 24:11.997
I am not her babysitter.

24:11.498 --> 24:13.540
No, no, no. Ed, I didn't mean it like...

24:13.541 --> 24:15.822
No, I should know how to calm
her down. She's my daughter.

24:15.846 --> 24:17.406
I should know all of her little quirks.

24:17.407 --> 24:19.047
I should know which
cry means she's hungry

24:19.048 --> 24:20.895
and which cry means
she's tired, but I don't.

24:22.884 --> 24:24.510
I don't want to be her babysitter.

24:24.511 --> 24:25.844
I want to be her father.

24:25.845 --> 24:27.221
It's okay. Shh.

24:28.598 --> 24:31.850
She's congested.

24:31.851 --> 24:34.102
I know what to do.

24:34.103 --> 24:36.438
Okay, okay, sweetie.
It's gonna be okay. Shh.

24:35.939 --> 24:37.732
So, everyone knows?

24:37.733 --> 24:40.026
Not Theo or any of the kids.

24:40.027 --> 24:42.147
Why didn't you call me and
tell me what was happening?

24:42.171 --> 24:43.738
I could have been there for you.

24:43.739 --> 24:45.948
Honestly, I couldn't face anyone.

24:45.949 --> 24:48.200
Well, what are you doing?

24:48.201 --> 24:51.912
I'm trying to make it work.

24:51.913 --> 24:53.706
Uh-huh.

24:53.707 --> 24:55.207
What?

24:54.708 --> 24:56.793
- Nothing.
- Go on. Tell me.

24:56.794 --> 24:58.169
I want to know what you think.

24:58.170 --> 24:59.212
But do you?

24:59.213 --> 25:00.797
Why do you always make me work for it?

25:00.798 --> 25:03.049
Okay. Here goes. Uh...

25:02.550 --> 25:05.302
I'd understand if you never
want to see Eddie again,

25:05.303 --> 25:07.846
and I'd understand if you took him back.

25:07.847 --> 25:09.014
He's your husband,

25:09.015 --> 25:10.515
and you have a child together.

25:10.516 --> 25:12.309
What I can't understand

25:12.310 --> 25:14.603
is trying to make it work.

25:14.604 --> 25:16.855
You either make this work or you don't.

25:16.356 --> 25:19.108
Katherine Saville
doesn't try to win cases.

25:19.109 --> 25:20.568
She wins them.

25:20.569 --> 25:24.822
If you're going to be in, be all in.

25:25.824 --> 25:27.825
Thanks, Carter.

25:27.826 --> 25:31.162
So, is this a bad time to tell you

25:31.163 --> 25:33.164
that we need Baby Mama's signature

25:33.165 --> 25:35.416
to dissolve the Dixon
Properties account?

25:35.417 --> 25:36.959
Well, I can forge it.

25:36.960 --> 25:38.795
Do you want me to forge it?

25:38.796 --> 25:41.089
You're a criminal.

25:43.634 --> 25:45.760
- Alright, let's go.
- Hey.

25:45.761 --> 25:48.096
Bye, guys! Thank you!

25:48.097 --> 25:50.081
- Hi.
- Thank God you're open.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.841
- Only one in the neighborhood.
- Two, three... You know what?

25:51.842 --> 25:53.226
We can squeeze you in this way.

25:53.227 --> 25:55.520
Oh. Uh... we're not with them.

25:55.521 --> 25:56.897
Well, you are now. Follow me.

25:56.898 --> 25:58.273
Impromptu tonight.

25:58.274 --> 26:00.609
No power, our chef is
cooking up a storm.

26:00.610 --> 26:02.193
You'll see. Have a seat.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.237
Do you guys mind a little company?

26:04.238 --> 26:06.072
We can put the tables
together. Thank you.

26:06.073 --> 26:08.241
Gina, can you help me with the table?

26:08.242 --> 26:09.659
Oh, yes. Yes.

26:09.660 --> 26:11.912
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.000
You wanted a sign?

26:17.001 --> 26:19.128
- I think you just got one.
- I think so, too.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.930
- Here we go. This is our chef.
- Hi.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.898
- Please sit down, everyone.
- Everyone, dig in.

26:22.899 --> 26:25.134
- How long we got to be in here?
- As long as it takes.

26:25.135 --> 26:27.302
Unless, of course, you want
to use the snot sucker.

26:26.803 --> 26:29.013
- The snot sucker?
- It's exactly what it sounds like,

26:29.014 --> 26:30.264
except you use your mouth.

26:30.265 --> 26:31.807
Steam shower it is.

26:33.685 --> 26:36.520
There you go, Charlie.

26:36.521 --> 26:38.856
There you go, baby.

26:38.357 --> 26:41.016
- Hey, um... sorry about earlier.
- Oh, no, no.

26:41.041 --> 26:42.801
- Dude, dude, dude...
- I shouldn't have...

26:42.825 --> 26:44.028
...I can't even imagine

26:44.029 --> 26:45.948
what that must feel like for you, man.

26:47.324 --> 26:48.992
You hear that?

26:48.993 --> 26:50.743
What?

26:50.744 --> 26:52.328
Exactly.

26:52.329 --> 26:54.581
Silence.

26:54.082 --> 26:57.501
You knew exactly what to do
to take care of your daughter.

26:57.502 --> 26:59.378
Thanks.

26:59.379 --> 27:03.215
But all I can think about
is how in two hours,

27:03.216 --> 27:05.592
I have to walk out that front door.

27:05.093 --> 27:08.470
You know, I missed the first
three months of Theo's life

27:08.471 --> 27:10.890
'cause I was in rehab.

27:10.891 --> 27:12.850
And now I'm here,

27:12.851 --> 27:16.270
and I know exactly what I'm missing.

27:16.271 --> 27:17.855
And it kills me.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.066
It's okay.

27:20.067 --> 27:21.609
There you go.

27:21.610 --> 27:23.736
It's okay.

27:23.737 --> 27:26.280
She was always closer to Chad.

27:26.281 --> 27:28.574
They had this connection...

27:28.575 --> 27:34.080
that she never really had with me.

27:33.581 --> 27:35.415
Maybe she was closer with your brother,

27:35.416 --> 27:37.542
but it doesn't mean she...

27:37.543 --> 27:39.502
doesn't care about you.

27:39.503 --> 27:42.130
I get that you're trying
to make me feel better,

27:42.131 --> 27:43.256
but trust me.

27:43.257 --> 27:44.674
I know what I'm talking about.

27:47.053 --> 27:49.346
Well, you should know

27:49.347 --> 27:52.557
that the first time she wrote me was...

27:52.558 --> 27:54.809
right after you got sick.

27:57.313 --> 28:01.191
In fact, the only reason
she reached out to me

28:00.692 --> 28:04.486
is because she was
terrified of losing you.

28:05.864 --> 28:08.824
That's what she wrote in her letter.

28:11.078 --> 28:12.912
Grief...

28:12.913 --> 28:17.041
has a way of making
people do crazy things.

28:18.043 --> 28:19.210
Trust me.

28:26.094 --> 28:28.178
Did you lose somebody, too?

28:31.432 --> 28:34.184
My... fiancÃ©.

28:39.941 --> 28:42.526
It was right after we got engaged.

28:42.527 --> 28:44.945
I-I took her on a...

28:44.946 --> 28:50.242
...trip to Martha's Vineyard
for the weekend, and, um...

28:52.578 --> 28:55.580
...we rented a motorcycle.

28:57.583 --> 29:00.210
I was driving...

29:00.211 --> 29:03.797
and, um, Chloe was on the...

29:03.798 --> 29:06.258
I'm so sorry.

29:07.760 --> 29:11.930
Sometimes I just think if
we hadn't gone on that trip,

29:11.931 --> 29:13.515
if we'd have...

29:13.516 --> 29:16.018
if I had made a different choice...

29:20.607 --> 29:22.692
What is it?

29:22.693 --> 29:24.277
Um...

29:24.278 --> 29:26.112
It's your mom.

29:26.113 --> 29:28.740
She's, uh...

29:28.741 --> 29:30.074
She's headed to the airport.

29:30.075 --> 29:32.201
She's going back home.

29:39.419 --> 29:42.212
â™ª Yeah, we out every week,
yeah, we out every week â™ª

29:42.213 --> 29:44.048
â™ª Always party till 3:00 somehow â™ª

29:44.049 --> 29:46.342
â™ª Like we stuck on repeat,
like we stuck on repeat â™ª

29:46.343 --> 29:47.943
â™ª And that's not what I need right now â™ª

29:48.975 --> 29:50.679
â™ª I decided to leave,
I decided to leave â™ª

29:50.680 --> 29:51.930
â™ª I just wanted some sleep â™ª

29:51.431 --> 29:52.974
- â™ª Oh, whoa â™ª
- Look at this.

29:52.975 --> 29:54.433
Look at what you did.

29:53.934 --> 29:55.935
What we did.

29:57.104 --> 29:59.606
Maybe we should make
this a regular thing.

29:59.607 --> 30:01.858
Family style.

30:01.859 --> 30:03.610
Mm-hmm.

30:03.611 --> 30:05.820
I love it.

30:05.821 --> 30:10.325
â™ª Find out what we're made of â™ª

30:10.326 --> 30:16.748
â™ª When we are called to
help our friends in need â™ª

30:16.249 --> 30:21.378
â™ª You can count on me like one, two... â™ª

30:22.843 --> 30:24.047
Hey, guys.

30:24.048 --> 30:25.457
- Sophie...
- Hey, no, no, no.

30:25.458 --> 30:27.551
Don't stop. Keep going. I want
to know what comes after "two".

30:27.552 --> 30:29.512
No, no. This is not what
it looks like. Seriously.

30:29.536 --> 30:31.155
Yeah, but, you know,
we're just gonna let

30:31.180 --> 30:33.060
the Internet decide.

30:32.085 --> 30:33.646
- No, no, don't do that. Don't...
- Yep.

30:33.670 --> 30:34.709
Soph...

30:34.710 --> 30:37.271
We're wearing pants.

30:41.775 --> 30:43.359
Good luck.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.195
- I'll wait right here.
- Thanks.

30:54.331 --> 30:55.991
Thanks, Gary. I'll text you when I land.

30:56.015 --> 30:58.125
Yeah. Safe flight.

31:06.259 --> 31:07.259
Mom?

31:08.678 --> 31:10.388
Mom!

31:14.768 --> 31:17.353
H-How did you know that I was here?

31:17.354 --> 31:19.314
- Um...
- I was with Eric.

31:19.857 --> 31:21.149
Oh, I knew...

31:21.150 --> 31:23.192
I knew once the two of you
got to know each other,

31:23.193 --> 31:25.903
I-I knew you would see
this as a good thing.

31:25.904 --> 31:28.506
- Mom...
- I can't tell you how much

31:28.507 --> 31:30.324
it's helped me to have Eric in my life.

31:31.744 --> 31:32.827
But, Maggie...

31:32.828 --> 31:34.955
when your cancer came back...

31:34.956 --> 31:36.414
I know. I know.

31:36.415 --> 31:39.000
Eric told me everything.

31:41.003 --> 31:42.379
Yeah.

31:42.380 --> 31:46.549
I was just so scared, you know?

31:46.550 --> 31:49.594
I thought I was gonna lose you, too.

31:51.597 --> 31:53.348
That's why I-I wanted to meet Eric

31:53.349 --> 31:55.850
the last time I was in town,
before I came to see you.

31:55.851 --> 31:58.603
Wait, last time you were...

31:58.604 --> 32:00.855
You mean, when...

32:00.856 --> 32:03.441
when you were here for my surgery?

32:03.442 --> 32:05.610
Mom...

32:05.111 --> 32:07.321
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

32:07.322 --> 32:09.990
I was actually starting to think

32:09.991 --> 32:12.242
that you came here for me,

32:12.243 --> 32:14.161
but that's not true, is it?

32:14.162 --> 32:16.997
It was never about me.

32:16.498 --> 32:18.416
It was about meeting some stranger

32:18.417 --> 32:20.918
who just happens to have Chad's heart.

32:20.919 --> 32:22.628
- No...
- You wanted him in your life.

32:22.629 --> 32:24.880
You don't understand, honey.

32:24.881 --> 32:27.466
Every time I go into a hospital...

32:27.467 --> 32:31.262
I think of the day that I lost Chad.

32:31.263 --> 32:34.015
Even on the day it
should've been about me?

32:34.016 --> 32:35.516
Yes.

32:35.517 --> 32:36.809
I saw Eric before,

32:36.810 --> 32:38.602
but I was there for you
when you woke up.

32:38.603 --> 32:40.646
What if I hadn't woken up, Mom?

32:40.647 --> 32:42.690
Maggie, that is unfair.

32:42.191 --> 32:44.025
Nothing about this is fair.

32:44.026 --> 32:45.276
Nothing.

32:45.277 --> 32:48.488
God, I always knew
Chad was your favorite.

32:48.489 --> 32:50.406
Even when I was a kid,

32:50.407 --> 32:52.075
I knew you loved him more than me,

32:52.076 --> 32:53.743
and somehow, I accepted that.

32:53.244 --> 32:54.578
But you know what?

32:54.579 --> 32:58.248
Chad is dead, and I'm here,

32:58.249 --> 33:01.878
and you are still choosing him over me.

33:03.171 --> 33:05.088
Maggie, I'm...

33:05.089 --> 33:07.549
Maggie!

33:33.203 --> 33:36.914
I take it it didn't go well
with your mom.

33:40.752 --> 33:43.879
For a minute, I believed...

33:45.215 --> 33:48.842
It's okay.

33:53.139 --> 33:55.182
Just know when you're ready...

33:56.352 --> 33:59.229
...I'm here for you.

33:59.830 --> 34:01.046
I know.

34:01.471 --> 34:02.957
Thank you.

34:12.118 --> 34:14.119
Here you go.

34:14.120 --> 34:17.496
Oh, no, that's not for me.

34:17.498 --> 34:21.376
â™ª Tell me the truth â™ª

34:21.377 --> 34:25.630
â™ª Is there really poison in the well? â™ª

34:25.632 --> 34:27.925
Hey, you.

34:26.926 --> 34:28.176
Hey.

34:28.177 --> 34:29.928
How was it today?

34:29.929 --> 34:31.971
She's pretty perfect.

34:33.098 --> 34:35.683
Listen, I-I know how hard this is,

34:35.684 --> 34:39.187
and I just want you
to know how much I...

34:39.188 --> 34:41.356
I'm just... I'm really glad

34:41.357 --> 34:44.192
that you got to spend
time with her today.

34:44.193 --> 34:45.735
Me, too.

34:45.735 --> 34:48.112
Yeah.

34:50.616 --> 34:51.949
Look at this, huh?

34:51.951 --> 34:53.326
Hey, y'all.

34:53.327 --> 34:56.329
So, the next time I want a free
meal, I just, what... cut the power?

34:55.330 --> 34:57.831
Since when have you ever paid here?

34:57.832 --> 35:00.125
- Are you guys hungry?
- Starving.

35:00.126 --> 35:02.252
Lucky for you, I made everything.

35:02.253 --> 35:04.755
- Oh.
- Everything's my favorite.

35:06.174 --> 35:07.633
Come sit.

35:11.304 --> 35:12.681
Yes!

35:17.978 --> 35:19.603
Katherine. Hey.

35:19.604 --> 35:20.729
Hi.

35:24.275 --> 35:25.943
Hey.

35:25.444 --> 35:27.153
I am glad you came.

35:27.154 --> 35:28.738
I wasn't sure you would.

35:28.739 --> 35:31.073
Neither was I.

35:34.453 --> 35:36.787
After you.

35:36.788 --> 35:38.831
Yes.

35:38.332 --> 35:40.875
Hey, Katherine. Are you hungry?

35:40.876 --> 35:42.076
Hey. Yes. You know what?

35:42.100 --> 35:43.211
Here. Here, have a seat.

35:43.212 --> 35:44.921
Or you... you can stand if you... you...

35:44.922 --> 35:46.172
You want a drink? You know?

35:46.173 --> 35:47.841
Or not. You don't have to drink.

35:47.842 --> 35:49.467
You... Are you hungry, girl? 'Cause...

35:49.468 --> 35:50.468
She said that.

35:50.469 --> 35:52.220
You know what?

35:52.221 --> 35:53.930
Let's not do this.

35:55.433 --> 35:58.018
I know you all know.

35:58.019 --> 36:02.731
And yes, it is incredibly awkward.

36:02.732 --> 36:07.861
So, while I appreciate
everyone looking out for me...

36:07.362 --> 36:10.072
honestly, it's making me feel worse.

36:10.073 --> 36:15.911
So, for me, please, just stop.

36:21.293 --> 36:23.127
Well... I, for one,

36:23.128 --> 36:25.171
am glad you finally said
something, Katherine.

36:25.172 --> 36:26.772
I'm sick and tired of the way this group

36:26.796 --> 36:29.425
makes some of us feel like outsiders.

36:29.426 --> 36:32.094
Oh, you think I don't see it, Gina?

36:32.095 --> 36:34.930
Well, let me just come out and say it.

36:34.931 --> 36:37.850
Yes, people...

36:37.851 --> 36:40.102
I have one nipple.

36:40.438 --> 36:41.855
One.

36:41.856 --> 36:44.733
And you love to undress me
with your eyes. And I get it.

36:44.734 --> 36:46.494
I do. If I had a friend
who looked like this,

36:46.518 --> 36:47.694
I'd undress him with my eyes,

36:47.695 --> 36:50.322
but my eyes are up here, okay?

36:51.324 --> 36:53.241
Thank you, all.

36:53.242 --> 36:55.494
Noted.

36:57.330 --> 36:58.497
- Right?
- Appreciate it.

36:58.498 --> 36:59.998
Uh, in a sec.

36:59.999 --> 37:01.027
Okay.

37:04.837 --> 37:07.214
I would like to thank
you and your nipples.

37:07.215 --> 37:08.715
- Nipple.
- Oh.

37:08.716 --> 37:10.675
Have you learned nothing?

37:10.676 --> 37:12.803
Sorry.

37:12.804 --> 37:14.846
How are you doing?

37:14.847 --> 37:16.765
Um...

37:16.766 --> 37:18.934
I wasn't doing too
well there for a while.

37:18.435 --> 37:19.835
Yeah, you definitely had me scared.

37:19.836 --> 37:22.129
I thought I was gonna have to
do the whole guardian thing.

37:22.130 --> 37:24.690
Oh, no.

37:24.691 --> 37:26.775
I just...

37:26.776 --> 37:31.405
I couldn't let Theo see me like that.

37:32.908 --> 37:35.743
I just feel ashamed that I...

37:35.744 --> 37:37.078
that I...

37:37.079 --> 37:39.497
When I was Theo's age, my mother left.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.085
You know what you did
that she never did?

37:44.086 --> 37:45.503
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

37:45.504 --> 37:47.088
You came back.

37:47.089 --> 37:49.882
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

37:49.883 --> 37:51.175
Okay?

37:51.176 --> 37:54.262
- â™ª You can count on me â™ª
- Thanks, Gary.

37:53.263 --> 37:54.513
â™ª Like one, two, three â™ª

37:54.514 --> 37:55.681
Thank you.

37:55.682 --> 37:58.058
â™ª I'll be there â™ª

37:58.059 --> 38:00.853
â™ª And I know when I need it, I can â™ª

38:00.854 --> 38:02.974
- â™ª Count on you â™ª
- Would you excuse me for a minute?

38:02.975 --> 38:05.295
- â™ª Like four, three, two â™ª
- I will, but quick reminder...

38:05.319 --> 38:08.026
murder is illegal and bad for business.

38:08.027 --> 38:12.157
â™ª 'Cause that's what friends
are supposed to do, oh, yeah â™ª

38:13.701 --> 38:14.701
Katherine.

38:14.702 --> 38:17.161
Look, I know that I've put you

38:17.162 --> 38:18.829
in this impossible situation,

38:18.330 --> 38:21.082
but I-I just need you to know

38:21.083 --> 38:22.583
that there's nothing I want more

38:22.584 --> 38:25.044
than for you and Eddie to make it.

38:25.045 --> 38:28.005
So do I.

38:28.006 --> 38:29.965
Which means, like it or not,

38:29.966 --> 38:33.511
you and I are gonna be in
each other's lives forever.

38:35.013 --> 38:39.308
So, we need to find a
way to make this work.

38:39.309 --> 38:41.185
I know. Whatever you need.

38:41.186 --> 38:43.187
Whatever you want me to do,

38:43.188 --> 38:44.855
just tell me.

38:44.856 --> 38:48.484
There is something you can do.

38:48.485 --> 38:50.695
You can sign these forms

38:50.696 --> 38:54.115
so I can make sure you
stay in your house.

38:54.116 --> 38:56.492
Right there.

38:56.994 --> 38:59.412
Oh, my God, Katherine.

38:59.413 --> 39:01.414
â™ª If you're tossin' and you're turnin' â™ª

39:01.415 --> 39:04.584
â™ª And you just can't fall asleep â™ª

39:04.085 --> 39:06.253
â™ª I'll sing a song â™ª

39:06.254 --> 39:07.713
â™ª Beside you â™ª

39:07.714 --> 39:09.214
Thank you.

39:09.215 --> 39:13.093
â™ª And if you ever forget how
much you really mean to me â™ª

39:13.094 --> 39:16.430
â™ª Every day, I will â™ª

39:15.931 --> 39:19.266
â™ª Remind you â™ª

39:19.267 --> 39:22.561
Thank you, for...

39:22.562 --> 39:25.481
Really, just... for all of it.

39:27.984 --> 39:33.322
â™ª Always have my shoulder when you cry â™ª

39:36.827 --> 39:38.786
â™ª I'll never let go â™ª

39:38.787 --> 39:41.227
- Hey, man, can I get a whiskey neat?
- Sure thing.

39:41.251 --> 39:44.250
â™ª Never say goodbye â™ª

39:44.251 --> 39:47.086
â™ª You know you can â™ª

39:47.087 --> 39:51.549
â™ª Count on me like one, two, three â™ª

39:51.050 --> 39:52.300
â™ª I'll be there â™ª

39:54.971 --> 39:56.429
- Hi.
- Hey.

39:56.430 --> 39:58.348
Uh, forgot your...

39:58.349 --> 40:00.308
You left this at the house.

40:00.309 --> 40:02.185
Oh, yeah.

40:02.186 --> 40:04.604
Thanks.

40:07.400 --> 40:09.442
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

40:09.443 --> 40:11.111
Ah, I should probably go check on D.

40:11.112 --> 40:14.239
Uh, make sure nobody needs a body bag.

40:16.367 --> 40:19.369
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

40:20.747 --> 40:22.915
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:22.916 --> 40:25.000
How'd it go with Katherine?

40:26.085 --> 40:28.170
She's a saint.

40:29.672 --> 40:32.382
How about you? You found Maggie.

40:32.383 --> 40:34.301
How'd it go with her mom?

40:34.302 --> 40:36.345
I don't know.

40:36.346 --> 40:39.223
She's not ready to talk about it yet.

40:42.101 --> 40:44.853
- â™ª Count on me â™ª
- At least not with me.

40:44.854 --> 40:47.606
â™ª Like one, two three â™ª

40:49.318 --> 40:51.694
Hi, can I get a glass of red?

40:51.695 --> 40:56.115
â™ª Count on you like four, three, two â™ª

41:02.831 --> 41:05.458
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª

41:05.459 --> 41:11.673
â™ª Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh â™ª
