00:00.851 --> 00:03.371
Previously on Dance Academy...
It was kind of a mess.

00:03.405 --> 00:07.945
I'm gonna need a minute
to shake that out of my head.

00:07.955 --> 00:09.836
I don't think Saskia's
going to mark me fairly.

00:09.877 --> 00:14.740
I asked Saskia to push you. She says
you've been focused on boyfriends.

00:14.751 --> 00:17.763
I kissed my
best friend's ex-boyfriend,

00:17.783 --> 00:20.823
so it kind of seems like
the right time to get away.

00:22.032 --> 00:26.104
I am moving to Paris
to be a dancer in the Moulin Rouge!

00:27.024 --> 00:30.116
Wow, that's...
Amazing, I guess?

00:31.337 --> 01:15.903

<font color="#3399CC"></font>

01:22.490 --> 01:25.950
Sometimes even now I feel like
such a country girl.

01:26.043 --> 01:30.983
The idea of living overseas in a
place where they don't speak English

01:30.999 --> 01:33.019
is mind-bending.

01:33.039 --> 01:37.023
Bonjour! Would madam care
to drool on some croissants?

01:37.043 --> 01:41.003
Ah, I can't believe this is
gonna be my everyday breakfast!

01:41.023 --> 01:44.043
Stop it! It's hard enough
not having you at the Academy.

01:44.063 --> 01:47.027
I'm incapable of
an ocean of distance. Oh!

01:47.047 --> 01:50.987
Fear not, little one, you still
have two weeks to adore me.

01:52.051 --> 01:55.007
It's possible, if I work hard enough,

01:55.027 --> 01:58.987
a few years here,
then a residency as a guest artist

01:59.003 --> 02:01.027
somewhere incredible in Europe...

02:04.055 --> 02:08.050
But even knowing that's at stake,
I'll still space out in class,

02:08.071 --> 02:11.987
get distracted by my friends,
by boys, by life.

02:13.051 --> 02:16.007
I think that's called self-sabotage.

02:18.000 --> 02:24.074

02:40.995 --> 02:42.051
Wow, sweetie.

02:42.071 --> 02:47.011
If your Prelude solo's that boring,
imagine if I let you do Red Shoes.

02:47.031 --> 02:51.987
Remember, we don't want the
Prix judges slipping into a coma.

02:52.003 --> 02:54.071
Abigail, wake me up.

02:57.015 --> 02:59.055
Fun times.

03:07.011 --> 03:09.987
Oh, I love that intro.
Totally suits you.

03:11.011 --> 03:12.055
Gorgeous.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.011
I cannot stress enough
how unprecedented this is.

03:19.031 --> 03:22.071
Normally when a student fails...
They're kicked out.

03:22.991 --> 03:27.023
Thank you for arranging me a tutor.
You are a benevolent god.

03:32.039 --> 03:34.059
Oliver.
One second.

03:55.019 --> 03:59.059
That's looking really...
It's rubbish. Are you my protege?

03:59.075 --> 04:01.075
Uh, Sammy Lieberman.

04:01.995 --> 04:05.995
I was blown away when you did
the Nutcracker Prince. Props, man.

04:06.011 --> 04:08.063
Oliver topped second year last year.

04:08.983 --> 04:12.003
Do you think there's anything
you can teach him?

04:12.023 --> 04:16.067
I've been studying your technique -
walk back and forth, yell, repeat.

04:16.987 --> 04:19.067
I can't wait to get started.

04:30.039 --> 04:35.987
So I've, I've come up with
a suggested training schedule.

04:36.003 --> 04:38.007
The first thing to address is diet,

04:38.027 --> 04:41.987
so we need a works burger
from the place on the corner.

04:42.003 --> 04:44.071
Seriously?

04:44.987 --> 04:46.047
Who's the sensei here?

04:46.063 --> 04:50.051
Wax on, wax off. Gotcha.

04:53.007 --> 04:55.075
Boys, but this is as far as you go.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.075
I'm not bringing an entourage
to my first day of rehearsal.

04:59.995 --> 05:03.055
Why are you rehearsing here?
Half our dancers are Australian.

05:03.075 --> 05:06.075
We rehearse here,
then ship them over. You are?

05:06.995 --> 05:10.983
Sorry, April, Academy students.
They begged me for a field trip.

05:11.003 --> 05:13.991
We'll be like ninjas -
you won't see us.

05:15.051 --> 05:17.995
Pour vous. I'll see you in there.

05:18.015 --> 05:21.063
Ah! This is mine! See,
that is my name!

05:21.983 --> 05:24.039
I thought the skirts
would be shorter.

05:42.995 --> 05:46.003
Thunder Kats are go!
Woo!

05:46.019 --> 05:48.047
I thought you were gonna be ninjas.

05:48.067 --> 05:53.031
Kat, that was on three!
Sorry, April! I'll get faster!

06:04.019 --> 06:05.071
Whoops.

06:07.007 --> 06:08.983
Sorry.

06:08.999 --> 06:11.003
Woo!

06:12.995 --> 06:15.039
Marilyn, meet Tara.

06:15.055 --> 06:17.039
She's going to co-parent.

06:17.059 --> 06:22.047
Saskia's right, Prelude is the
most boring solo choice imaginable.

06:22.067 --> 06:26.047
Mummy Tara wants to do the Red Shoes,
doesn't she, Marilyn?

06:26.067 --> 06:30.051
I used to watch the video when I
was little. It means something.

06:30.071 --> 06:33.031
Well, couldn't Lucy
veto Saskia's veto?

06:33.051 --> 06:37.011
Miss Raine already thinks I'm
the girl who cried victimisation.

06:37.031 --> 06:40.051
It'd be different
if she saw how Saskia treats me.

06:40.071 --> 06:44.039
Saskia's good at turning on
the nice when she needs to.

06:44.059 --> 06:47.023
Exactly.
No-one is going to believe me.

06:52.995 --> 06:57.031
How's that looking? I always
have trouble with that first beat.

06:57.051 --> 07:00.011
Yeah, great.
You should be very proud.

07:05.063 --> 07:09.043
We've only been here half an hour.
I thought we were gonna...

07:09.063 --> 07:13.003
Baby steps. I don't want you
going too fast too soon.

07:13.019 --> 07:15.003
That's when injuries happen.

07:15.023 --> 07:18.991
Did you even look at that schedule?
Yeah.

07:19.007 --> 07:20.075
We're not gonna do that.

07:23.983 --> 07:27.987
Talia's got this banker boyfriend
and her place is unbelievable.

07:28.003 --> 07:30.059
We're all gonna share a taxi over.

07:30.079 --> 07:32.079
Kat.
Hi.

07:32.999 --> 07:36.991
How do you think you went today?
I'm terrible at these questions.

07:37.007 --> 07:39.035
Um, it felt better towards the end.

07:39.055 --> 07:43.035
Tomorrow is massive and you need
to have that chorey down,

07:43.051 --> 07:45.059
so I'm suggesting an early night.

07:45.079 --> 07:48.051
Absolutely.
I think my body would thank me.

07:48.071 --> 07:50.015
Perfect.
'Night.

07:50.035 --> 07:53.039
Ignore her. She says that
after every rehearsal.

07:53.059 --> 07:57.027
Seriously, Paris is a party town
and physical fitness

07:57.043 --> 07:59.047
comes second to social stamina.

07:59.067 --> 08:02.047
We'll get your muscles
straight into a jacuzzi.

08:06.003 --> 08:07.079
I'll be back in a sec.

08:07.995 --> 08:09.079
You're still here.

08:09.995 --> 08:12.983
Uh, what happened to the Benster?

08:13.003 --> 08:17.003
Prix freak-out, realised he couldn't
handle the day without training.

08:17.023 --> 08:18.995
Ah.
What are you doing now?

08:19.011 --> 08:22.003
Um, girls bonding session.

08:22.023 --> 08:26.075
Right. Alright, well,
thanks for letting me hang out today.

08:26.991 --> 08:29.011
Quality time.

08:30.071 --> 08:33.051
We're good now, right?
Mm-hmm, yep.

08:33.067 --> 08:35.058
We're tight, like glue.

08:42.051 --> 08:46.983
Is this the right size memory stick?
I really do not think it is.

08:47.003 --> 08:50.075
Deep breaths. Just get her
in an abusive frame of mind.

08:50.995 --> 08:54.007
Guys, I asked you to watch,
so someone has to watch.

08:54.027 --> 08:57.007
You're not getting your first beat?
I knew it.

08:57.027 --> 09:01.007
Miss Raine pitched this guy as my
saviour and he couldn't care less.

09:01.023 --> 09:02.059
Could just be a rumour,

09:02.079 --> 09:05.031
but I heard he got kicked
off the tour.

09:05.051 --> 09:08.023
Major director clash or something.
Brilliant.

09:08.043 --> 09:11.003
Now my entire future hangs
in his hands.

09:11.023 --> 09:14.035
What are you doing, anyway?
Good to go.

09:14.051 --> 09:17.063
You kids should really get out more.

09:17.079 --> 09:20.011
Sammy and I aren't actually here.

09:26.055 --> 09:27.999
Deja vu.

09:28.019 --> 09:31.039
I've been working really hard on it
in my spare time

09:31.059 --> 09:34.079
and all I want is one chance
to change your mind.

09:34.999 --> 09:38.051
Thrill me.

09:54.987 --> 09:56.039
What do you think?

09:56.059 --> 09:59.059
Everything I said
last time still holds.

09:59.079 --> 10:04.055
Sweetie, I know you want this
to work, but it just doesn't.

10:08.019 --> 10:10.055
I need more than that.

10:10.075 --> 10:14.987
The other teachers,
they give really specific notes,

10:15.003 --> 10:16.047
but you often don't.

10:16.067 --> 10:19.047
I know you haven't been
teaching long...

10:19.067 --> 10:24.067
So you're questioning my experience?
No, I'm trying to understand you.

10:26.079 --> 10:30.023
Alright.
So what made you pick Red Shoes?

10:30.043 --> 10:34.075
Well, at first I was
inspired by your version,

10:34.991 --> 10:37.071
but I also connect with the story.

10:37.991 --> 10:40.051
Do you?
What are you trying to convey?

10:40.071 --> 10:45.051
Victoria's pain. Finding the love
of her life and then choosing dance.

10:45.071 --> 10:48.051
In the end,
performing while grieving.

10:48.071 --> 10:52.039
So you've experienced
grief and heartbreak?

10:54.023 --> 10:56.023
Yes.
No, you haven't.

10:56.039 --> 10:57.991
You're a child.

10:58.011 --> 11:00.991
All I see is a silly kid
flouncing around,

11:01.011 --> 11:04.051
yet you're arrogant enough
to think you're an artist.

11:04.071 --> 11:08.055
I'm worried, because there are
so many girls more talented than you.

11:08.075 --> 11:11.055
What's gonna happen
at the end of third year

11:11.071 --> 11:13.991
when you don't get a contract?

11:14.011 --> 11:19.015
I know this is
your pretty little dream, but...

11:22.079 --> 11:24.071
Say it.

11:26.023 --> 11:28.047
You're never going to make it.

11:28.067 --> 11:33.047
You're not good enough
and you never will be.

11:45.023 --> 11:47.043
No, you haven't. You're a child.

11:47.063 --> 11:51.043
All I see is a silly kid flouncing
around... She sounded so sure.

11:51.063 --> 11:55.043
This is like one of those celeb
meltdowns. We should put it online.

11:55.063 --> 11:59.043
This was just for Miss Raine.
If Saskia knew, I'd get kicked out.

11:59.059 --> 12:01.063
A, you can claim WikiLeaks did it,

12:01.983 --> 12:05.063
B, after people see this, you won't
be the one getting kicked out.

12:05.983 --> 12:09.075
I should call Kat.
You need to wean yourself off that.

12:09.995 --> 12:13.035
She is not going to be able
to help you from Paris.

12:13.055 --> 12:16.015
Look, ballet teachers
get away with this,

12:16.035 --> 12:18.995
because they have power
and we have none.

12:19.015 --> 12:21.995
Don't you think it's time
we took it back?

12:29.043 --> 12:33.035
You're a child. All I see is
a silly kid flouncing around,

12:33.055 --> 12:36.075
yet you have the arrogance
to think you're an artist.

12:36.991 --> 12:38.023
I'm worried.

12:38.043 --> 12:42.043
There's a comment from a dancer
in Finland - you've gone viral.

12:42.059 --> 12:45.003
Girl after my own heart. Solid gold.

12:45.019 --> 12:47.051
I've got to talk to Miss Raine.

12:47.071 --> 12:51.071
No, wait until she comes to you,
then pretend you haven't seen it.

12:51.991 --> 12:55.007
If you go to her,
you're incriminating yourself.

12:55.027 --> 12:59.007
Camera really is unforgiving.
I'd invest in some concealer.

12:59.027 --> 13:03.039
We don't know what you're talking
about. I'm already incriminated.

13:06.983 --> 13:09.019
Is it gonna be my turn next or...?

13:10.047 --> 13:12.987
Nope, still you.

13:15.023 --> 13:18.039
I heard you got kicked off
the third year tour.

13:19.995 --> 13:23.075
I told Humphries where to stick
his Stone-Age choreography.

13:23.995 --> 13:27.079
I should be dux, but they punished me
for having an opinion.

13:27.999 --> 13:31.015
Which means I'm, what,
community service?

13:31.035 --> 13:34.075
You tutor me, you go back on tour?
That's about it.

13:36.991 --> 13:40.007
Yeah, I don't know
what Miss Raine's gonna think

13:40.023 --> 13:41.987
when I request a new tutor.

13:42.007 --> 13:44.063
Protege,
where do you think you're going?

13:44.983 --> 13:49.987
It's a shame, 'cause third year's
tour is pretty make-it-or-break-it.

13:50.007 --> 13:53.987
But then again, so are my exams
and my needs aren't being met.

13:54.003 --> 13:56.079
Dude, look at me.

13:57.983 --> 14:01.047
Look at you.
You really want to be making threats?

14:12.007 --> 14:15.983
We'll start from the top,
so I hope you're all warmed up.

14:16.003 --> 14:20.055
Kat, you're gonna have to spend
your first pay cheque on a watch.

14:20.071 --> 14:23.035
I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

14:23.051 --> 14:25.035
Your skirt's on backwards.

14:25.055 --> 14:29.035
How are you so perky?
Practice and caffeine.

14:29.055 --> 14:31.987
Oh.
Are we keeping you, ladies?

14:32.003 --> 14:33.059
No.

14:47.039 --> 14:50.051
Tara. I was gonna come find you.

14:51.651 --> 15:01.011
Um... yesterday the specialist
told me that I'm not healing right,

15:01.027 --> 15:04.011
and I didn't take it so well.

15:04.027 --> 15:07.011
That... that's understandable.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.039
And I think that you
copped the brunt of it.

15:10.059 --> 15:13.059
I shouldn't have gone
so far in our session.

15:13.075 --> 15:16.023
Oh, right.

15:16.043 --> 15:20.015
It'd be great if we could
keep that between us.

15:20.031 --> 15:21.983
Uh-huh.

15:22.003 --> 15:25.983
I'll get your Les Sylphides looking
decent, OK? That's a promise.

15:34.051 --> 15:36.063
She hasn't seen it yet.

15:39.079 --> 15:43.015
Sammy. Getting in touch
with your feminine side?

15:43.035 --> 15:46.035
I need a bit of extra class time,
that's all.

15:48.051 --> 15:51.015
Your week's looking
as good as mine.

15:51.031 --> 15:52.983
You saw it? Thoughts?

15:53.003 --> 15:57.027
You don't need a second opinion.
You set her up, T.

15:57.047 --> 16:00.047
I get that it's hard
to stand up for yourself,

16:00.063 --> 16:02.031
I really get that, but...

16:02.051 --> 16:06.991
You know, I forgot that
with Kat gone, you're still here.

16:09.039 --> 16:12.059
I'm gonna go tell
Miss Raine it was me.

16:20.987 --> 16:23.063
Tara, I believe we need
to have a talk.

16:48.035 --> 16:51.983
Right, take five, everyone.

16:51.999 --> 16:55.055
Kat, can I see you for a second?

16:55.075 --> 17:00.047
If you shout me a latte,
I will worship you for eternity.

17:02.039 --> 17:07.067
Phew! Well, I thought that was pretty
good for a second rehearsal.

17:07.987 --> 17:13.007
And check this out - s'il vous plait
ne pas uriner dans la rue.

17:13.027 --> 17:16.047
What, please do not urinate
on the street?

17:16.067 --> 17:17.994
Uh-huh.
Essential.

17:18.011 --> 17:19.055
Take a seat.

17:25.067 --> 17:29.983
Kat, I know you're young, but there
are standards of professionalism

17:30.003 --> 17:32.983
that we expect
from all of our dancers.

17:33.003 --> 17:37.015
I know, I know. I'm sorry, I
won't be late again. Scout's honour.

17:37.035 --> 17:41.031
You also brought your boyfriends
to your first rehearsal,

17:41.051 --> 17:45.031
and then you partied last night
after my specific request.

17:45.051 --> 17:50.039
I think I've been
a little bit overexcited.

17:50.059 --> 17:54.995
Unfortunately, we can't take you
to Paris this time.

17:55.011 --> 17:57.027
Why? Where am I going?

17:57.043 --> 17:59.067
We're letting you go.

17:59.983 --> 18:02.043
You were a borderline choice,

18:02.063 --> 18:05.067
and I'd just hoped
you would show enough maturity.

18:05.983 --> 18:08.007
You are really talented, Kat,

18:08.027 --> 18:11.027
but you're just
not ready for this contract.

18:11.047 --> 18:15.023
In a few years, with some more
training and experience, who knows?

18:15.039 --> 18:17.043
But we should stay in touch.

18:21.039 --> 18:24.015
Do you know
how I found out about this?

18:24.035 --> 18:27.075
A board member rang me,
wanting to know if the students

18:27.995 --> 18:31.035
were waging a war against
the teachers. I had no idea.

18:31.055 --> 18:35.035
You didn't just maliciously attack
Saskia, you attacked the school.

18:35.055 --> 18:38.015
I didn't mean to.
I wanted you to know...

18:38.035 --> 18:41.999
What I don't understand
is when you got so thin-skinned.

18:42.019 --> 18:44.999
All the teachers are tough.
I'm tough on you.

18:45.019 --> 18:49.035
When you're tough on me I know why.
It's to make me better.

18:49.051 --> 18:51.983
With Saskia, that's not the reason.

19:31.079 --> 19:34.055
You work pretty hard
on your own stuff.

19:34.071 --> 19:37.015
Have to. No-one's giving me breaks.

19:37.035 --> 19:41.015
Right. Life is so hard for you.

19:41.031 --> 19:43.063
You know the reason I failed?

19:44.067 --> 19:48.023
I thought it was because
my dad stopped paying my fees

19:48.043 --> 19:51.023
and I had to work
all these extra shifts,

19:51.039 --> 19:53.991
but maybe I just wasn't good enough.

19:54.007 --> 19:55.063
Thanks for sharing.

19:55.079 --> 19:59.999
You're kind of like him, my dad.

20:00.019 --> 20:04.035
You think you know it all and that
can intimidate me 'cause I don't.

20:04.055 --> 20:07.031
I look at things
from 35 different angles

20:07.047 --> 20:08.995
and I doubt myself.

20:10.043 --> 20:15.055
And I failed, but, unlike you,
I'm not blaming the world for that.

20:18.019 --> 20:22.051
You think you got kicked off
the third year tour for an opinion?

20:22.071 --> 20:25.999
Mate, you got kicked off
for being a douchebag.

20:26.019 --> 20:29.055
You've been practising this argument,
haven't you?

20:29.071 --> 20:32.003
I told you - I'm motivated.

20:36.063 --> 20:40.991
How about we take your ballet
from embarrassing to competent?

20:43.011 --> 20:47.019
You don't want to eat anything first
or write a status update?

20:47.039 --> 20:50.043
I'm thinking,
'Ollie should be less of a tool.'

21:20.007 --> 21:23.023
Hey, I've been workshopping
how to fit into a suitcase

21:23.039 --> 21:25.063
so I can stow away to Paris. Look.

21:25.079 --> 21:28.067
Looks cramped.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.983
Looks better with a suitcase.
Hang on a sec.

21:35.011 --> 21:37.071
A lot of people are gonna miss you.

21:39.023 --> 21:44.015
Doubtful. I was a tiny bit late
and April told me

21:44.035 --> 21:47.075
that I'm not professional enough
to keep my contract.

21:47.995 --> 21:51.079
No, that's crap. You wouldn't want
to work with someone like that.

21:51.995 --> 21:55.003
No, actually, um, she's really great,

21:55.023 --> 21:58.059
and she knows
what she's talking about.

22:00.991 --> 22:03.047
How... how did I do this?

22:03.067 --> 22:08.991
I had an amazing opportunity and,
kapow,

22:09.007 --> 22:11.015
the Kat effect strikes again.

22:15.071 --> 22:19.991
Sorry. I'm so sick
of screwing everything up!

22:27.027 --> 22:30.075
Saskia,
Tara and I have had a long talk,

22:30.991 --> 22:33.039
and she knows how wrongly she acted.

22:36.031 --> 22:40.983
I shouldn't have done that to you,
Saskia. It was cowardly.

22:41.003 --> 22:45.055
I had no idea you were so sensitive.
I've only ever tried to help you.

22:45.075 --> 22:50.007
Then I can trust both of you
will be able to put this behind you?

22:50.027 --> 22:53.035
Absolutely. It's already forgotten.
Good.

22:54.047 --> 22:59.015
Miss Raine. I'd very much like to
dance the Red Shoes in the Prix,

22:59.035 --> 23:03.027
if that's OK with you. From what
I saw, it looked promising.

23:06.999 --> 23:10.079
Well, guess we'd better get started,
if that's OK with you.

23:21.023 --> 23:24.059
Before I came here,
my old ballet teacher warned me

23:24.079 --> 23:29.047
not to get caught up in the politics,
because it's the worst self-sabotage.

23:30.063 --> 23:35.039
I don't know why I do it,
why I mess up what I want the most.

23:37.007 --> 23:42.039
I need to learn how to be brave,
to stand up and say what I want...

23:42.059 --> 23:45.039
even if it's just admitting it
to myself.

23:45.055 --> 23:46.991
Come in.

23:49.071 --> 23:52.987
Because that's the only way
I'm going to get it.

23:56.011 --> 23:57.079
Katrina.
