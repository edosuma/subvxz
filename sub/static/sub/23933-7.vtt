WEBVTT

00:08.219 --> 00:10.719
We just need to find a guy\Nwho wore these on the day.

00:12.089 --> 00:14.059
Didn't you hear\Nwhat the store clerk said?

00:14.190 --> 00:16.229
They sell about\N50 of these in a day.

00:16.389 --> 00:18.190
These three-striped\Nslippers are...

00:18.190 --> 00:20.129
the most common shoes\Nin this neighborhood.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.130
Can you please cooperate?

00:27.400 --> 00:28.400
One second, please.

00:33.679 --> 00:34.710
Different brand.

00:40.119 --> 00:41.550
Can you tell me\Nwhere batteries are?

00:41.619 --> 00:42.649
Over there.

00:43.550 --> 00:44.550
There?

00:45.590 --> 00:47.859
Right. You're studying\Nfor those exams too.

00:47.859 --> 00:48.990
I forgot.

00:54.160 --> 00:55.160
You know,

00:55.499 --> 00:57.230
the other party\Nisn't the only one...

00:57.300 --> 00:59.130
who gets hurt\Nwhen you stab them.

01:09.509 --> 01:11.080
The person who stabs\Nalso gets hurt.

01:11.679 --> 01:14.250
That's why professional\Nkillers cut off...

01:14.250 --> 01:15.449
the back of the knife,\Nor cover it up.

01:18.789 --> 01:21.190
Do you have\Na Phillips screwdriver?

01:25.830 --> 01:26.899
Wait here.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.009
When did you\Nhurt your hand?

01:42.679 --> 01:44.149
I got pricked\Nwith a screwdriver.

01:44.279 --> 01:45.679
You saw it happen.

01:53.089 --> 01:54.520
You're very skilled.

02:09.770 --> 02:10.869
The footprint\Nis different.

02:20.480 --> 02:24.149
(Queen of Mystery 2)

02:46.140 --> 02:49.210
Just take all the videos\Nand leave.

02:49.439 --> 02:53.249
I should just give you\Nthe whole laptop.

02:54.879 --> 02:56.550
Gosh, you talk too much.

02:56.550 --> 02:58.290
You're still a suspect.

02:58.290 --> 03:00.360
I'm telling you\Nto take the laptop...

03:00.360 --> 03:03.159
and inspect it\Nat your leisure.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.529
Do you sense anything?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.570
Who do you think\Nis the culprit?

03:33.360 --> 03:34.890
Do you know\Nwho the culprit is?

03:39.490 --> 03:40.899
Gosh, this is killing me.

03:40.899 --> 03:43.330
Is it him, Lee In Ho,

03:43.330 --> 03:45.029
the residence manager\Nor Yoon Mi Joo?

03:45.029 --> 03:46.270
Tell me.

03:53.710 --> 03:55.439
It's him, isn't it?

03:55.510 --> 03:57.779
I think it's him too.\NHe's too brazen.

03:58.179 --> 04:00.480
Please stop already.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.719
I really didn't do it.

04:03.920 --> 04:07.119
Do you know any clubs\Nin Gangnam?

04:07.390 --> 04:09.960
Why do you ask?\NDo you want to go?

04:11.529 --> 04:13.730
How is the chief doing?

04:15.200 --> 04:16.700
I'm concerned.

04:17.369 --> 04:19.469
If he doesn't\Nget promoted again,

04:19.469 --> 04:20.839
he has to leave\Nthe office.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.810
You shouldn't date\Na civil servant.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.979
The job\Nisn't stable at all.

04:27.409 --> 04:29.750
They don't make\Nmuch money either.

04:30.310 --> 04:31.649
I know.

04:32.210 --> 04:35.180
They do great things,\Nbut get paid so little.

04:35.549 --> 04:38.320
By the way, why aren't you\Ndating anyone?

04:38.820 --> 04:40.190
Do you want me to\Nset you up?

04:41.260 --> 04:44.060
There is someone I like.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.060
Of course.

04:46.760 --> 04:49.299
You're too pretty\Nto be single.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.770
Who is that lucky man?

04:51.770 --> 04:53.770
He doesn't even know\Nthat he's lucky.

04:54.140 --> 04:55.770
It's just me.

04:55.770 --> 04:58.409
What? You have a crush?

05:03.080 --> 05:05.010
I'm pathetic, aren't I?

05:11.149 --> 05:12.190
Here.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.489
Give it to the chief.

05:16.890 --> 05:18.330
Tell him to enjoy the cake\Nand cheer up...

05:18.330 --> 05:19.700
to get promoted.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.270
You know he loves\Nyour cake.

05:29.169 --> 05:30.940
Thanks to you,

05:31.969 --> 05:33.510
he'll get a promotion.

05:34.080 --> 05:35.640
A government official...

05:35.640 --> 05:37.180
shouldn't have\Nany scandals.

05:37.779 --> 05:38.880
Goodness.

05:39.349 --> 05:42.680
This cake\Nmust be expensive.

05:45.190 --> 05:46.760
Take it\Nas a friendly gesture.

05:47.489 --> 05:51.130
You're always so kind,\NMs. Jung.

05:58.700 --> 05:59.770
Ms. Jung.

06:00.700 --> 06:01.700
Thank you.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.169
You're welcome. Take care.

06:04.169 --> 06:05.270
You too.

06:05.739 --> 06:06.839
Let's go.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.349
Well, hi. Welcome.

06:18.489 --> 06:20.320
You should come by\Nmore often.

06:20.320 --> 06:22.489
You barely pay me a visit.

06:22.489 --> 06:25.359
I can't come here\Nunless I get permission...

06:25.359 --> 06:26.830
to leave.

06:28.299 --> 06:30.200
I'm honored to have...

06:30.200 --> 06:31.599
a conscripted policeman\Nhere.

06:31.870 --> 06:34.200
Come in. I have\Ndelicious black tea.

06:35.570 --> 06:37.210
I like Cola better.

06:37.669 --> 06:40.839
I have Cola too. Come in.

06:53.589 --> 06:55.190
Do you know where...

06:55.460 --> 06:57.289
Detective Ha lives now?

06:57.890 --> 06:58.960
No.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.760
He must have\Nnowhere to go...

07:01.760 --> 07:03.570
since his house\Nburned down.

07:04.299 --> 07:07.140
Do you think he lives\Nwith someone?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.669
I'm not interested\Nin Detective Ha.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.270
Could you give me\None more?

07:19.279 --> 07:20.349
Then...

07:21.080 --> 07:23.789
do you know anyone else\Nwho might know?

07:25.549 --> 07:26.919
The patrol officer?

07:30.190 --> 07:32.260
The Na Jin Tae case.

07:32.260 --> 07:34.229
I still think\Nhe's the culprit.

07:34.930 --> 07:36.700
His running shoes' color\Nis weird too.

07:37.270 --> 07:38.529
His running shoes?

07:45.969 --> 07:48.380
So the shelf fell.\NIt wasn't burglary.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.080
The new assistant\Nis a bit clumsy.

07:52.750 --> 07:54.080
Thank you.

07:54.080 --> 07:55.779
I was going to call\NDetective Ha...

07:55.779 --> 07:56.919
because I was scared.

07:56.989 --> 07:59.789
Detective Ha? From\NJoongjin Police Station?

07:59.989 --> 08:01.159
Do you know him?

08:01.859 --> 08:04.359
He caught the arsonist\Nwho set my shop on fire.

08:05.330 --> 08:07.299
Then you should know\NMs. Yoo too.

08:07.299 --> 08:08.460
Of course.

08:08.460 --> 08:10.830
She loves my cakes.

08:11.570 --> 08:13.969
By the way, how do you\Nknow them?

08:13.969 --> 08:17.140
When I was working at\NBaebang-dong office...

08:24.310 --> 08:25.710
The owner of this house?

08:26.210 --> 08:28.820
Two women\Nlived here before.

08:29.049 --> 08:31.089
But now I think\Na couple lives here.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.719
They're so lovey-dovey.

08:33.989 --> 08:35.960
They always go to work\Ntogether in the morning.

08:48.300 --> 08:49.499
Thank you.

08:52.170 --> 08:53.310
A couple?

09:04.119 --> 09:05.589
Lee In Ho isn't here.

09:05.690 --> 09:07.259
Lee In Ho isn't\Nthe culprit.

09:07.259 --> 09:08.389
I checked\Nthe security videos...

09:08.389 --> 09:09.519
near the entrance\Nand the hall.

09:09.519 --> 09:12.229
He was here until dawn on\Nthe day of the incident.

09:13.599 --> 09:16.099
I knew he'd be here.\NIt's a hot club.

09:16.099 --> 09:17.330
Is there anywhere else?

09:17.330 --> 09:18.930
There are many hot clubs.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.440
What kind of hot club?

09:20.700 --> 09:21.999
Hot women? Great music?

09:21.999 --> 09:23.810
Or celebrities?

09:23.810 --> 09:26.139
- Drugs.\N- What? Drugs?

09:35.180 --> 09:36.889
He didn't cry\Nbecause he was sad.

09:37.420 --> 09:38.690
It was marijuana.

09:38.690 --> 09:41.790
He didn't look like\Nhe could dance.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.160
Mr. Gye.

09:45.930 --> 09:48.800
What? A crackdown\Non illegal arcades?

09:50.170 --> 09:53.339
I'm busy. I have to catch\NLee Wang Sik's murderer.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.839
Murderer Yoon Mi Joo\Nis locked up.

09:58.670 --> 10:00.780
You know that... Hey.

10:00.780 --> 10:02.040
Hello?

10:03.710 --> 10:05.180
Ha Wan Seung!

10:09.550 --> 10:11.989
He's investigating\Nwithout my permission?

10:15.060 --> 10:16.160
I can't stand it anymore.

10:30.810 --> 10:32.979
I quit going to clubs\Nlong ago.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.619
Are you sure he's here?

10:42.619 --> 10:44.389
His car is parked outside.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.060
Sorry.

10:59.739 --> 11:01.239
What's this place?

11:02.040 --> 11:03.109
Goodness.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.609
Hello.

11:07.739 --> 11:08.879
Sorry.

11:10.050 --> 11:11.349
What? That's it?

11:11.349 --> 11:14.219
You're a policeman.\NDo it more thoroughly.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.219
Freeze! Police!

11:16.219 --> 11:17.550
Freeze!

11:19.050 --> 11:20.719
I got it filmed.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.430
Please send Detective Ha\Nto a different unit.

11:28.629 --> 11:30.269
I can't have a friend...

11:30.269 --> 11:33.170
from the police university\Nas my subordinate.

11:33.170 --> 11:35.469
But he's good\Nat catching criminals.

11:35.469 --> 11:37.139
He's good\Nat making trouble too.

11:37.969 --> 11:41.339
I feel like I'm holding\Na time bomb.

11:42.540 --> 11:44.710
Then where\Nshould I send him?

11:50.719 --> 11:52.320
- Unit Three.\N- Yes?

11:52.690 --> 11:54.759
Didn't you say you need\Nan extra officer?

11:55.820 --> 11:58.690
Everyone is working\Nvery hard, so it's okay.

11:59.430 --> 12:00.629
What about Unit Four?

12:00.629 --> 12:02.330
No, thank you.

12:05.430 --> 12:06.839
Unit Five, you take him.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.339
Did I make you upset? Why\Nwould you do this to me?

12:11.410 --> 12:13.910
Gosh, okay. Sit back down.

12:13.910 --> 12:15.509
We were just saying.

12:17.150 --> 12:19.210
Where did Mr. Lee\Ngo by the way?

12:19.210 --> 12:20.719
He was dispatched...

12:20.719 --> 12:22.050
Oh, right.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.849
The whole unit\Nis on dispatch.

12:24.249 --> 12:26.519
We should send him\Nto Unit Two.

12:26.519 --> 12:27.519
What?

12:27.719 --> 12:30.889
Right, no one in the unit\Nwill disagree with it.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.499
Let him act up\Nall he wants there.

12:33.759 --> 12:36.530
He's a man of self-will\Nanyway, so it's perfect.

12:37.269 --> 12:38.629
It's been decided then.

12:46.310 --> 12:48.940
But there's no one\Nin the unit.

12:49.109 --> 12:50.379
Goodness.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.790
Maybe it's because\Nyou all studied abroad.

13:00.219 --> 13:02.019
You guys hang out\Nin a fancy way.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.389
Look at these bar snacks.

13:03.790 --> 13:05.330
Goodness, punks.

13:05.960 --> 13:09.030
I heard you disguise drugs\Ninto snacks...

13:09.030 --> 13:10.030
and smuggle them\Nthese days.

13:11.570 --> 13:12.670
It's not true, is it?

13:13.499 --> 13:14.499
Right?

13:19.910 --> 13:20.910
This is great.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.109
I woke up early at dawn...

13:23.979 --> 13:25.479
that my blood sugar level\Nis low.

13:31.650 --> 13:33.660
I almost forgot\Nthat I don't like sweets.

13:34.660 --> 13:36.330
Stop eating\Ntoo much sugar.

13:36.330 --> 13:38.729
Otherwise, your teeth\Nmight decay. Goodness.

13:42.900 --> 13:43.900
What's this?

13:44.200 --> 13:45.599
Do you eat\Npostage stamps...

13:45.969 --> 13:47.170
as bar snacks?

13:47.170 --> 13:49.300
Our hobby\Nis to collect stamps.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.280
So you brought them\Nto a club to show off?

13:55.979 --> 13:58.050
Hey, you. The quiet punk.

13:58.509 --> 13:59.820
Open your mouth.

14:02.349 --> 14:04.089
Goodness.

14:05.389 --> 14:06.420
Hey.

14:07.290 --> 14:08.290
Open it.

14:09.190 --> 14:10.190
What's this?

14:11.690 --> 14:12.790
Why you punks...

14:14.030 --> 14:15.859
Do you collect them\Nin your mouth?

14:16.900 --> 14:19.229
This is LSD...

14:19.639 --> 14:20.999
disguised in\Na postage stamp, right?

14:22.940 --> 14:25.469
Gosh, you guys were\Nhaving a feast today...

14:26.070 --> 14:28.810
with marijuana, ecstasy,\Nand meth.

14:30.310 --> 14:32.509
Have you heard about\NSeodong's Sniffer?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.280
That's me.

14:36.889 --> 14:37.989
Is this the room?

14:39.719 --> 14:41.460
No, go search other rooms.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.759
I guess it's time you\Nshould quit taking drugs,

14:48.430 --> 14:50.269
seeing how\Nyou're so fearless.

14:53.239 --> 14:55.269
You said this isn't\Nthe right room.

14:56.239 --> 14:57.540
Come out already.

14:59.540 --> 15:01.479
What are you doing there?

15:02.180 --> 15:03.180
What is it?

15:12.249 --> 15:14.190
Lee In Ho is in this room,\Nisn't he?

15:16.160 --> 15:18.989
Don't you have\Na bit of pain...

15:19.460 --> 15:21.430
on your shoulders or neck?

15:22.660 --> 15:24.330
It happens to everyone...

15:25.099 --> 15:26.440
who study for a long time.

15:29.570 --> 15:31.839
The smell was\Nreally fresh.

15:36.180 --> 15:37.609
It smells very fresh.

15:38.780 --> 15:41.450
It's a very common scent\Nin Noryang-dong.

15:42.219 --> 15:43.749
It's that\Nof a pain relief patch.

15:43.920 --> 15:44.950
Who are you?

15:47.519 --> 15:48.889
Is it because you came\Nto hang out in Gangnam?

15:49.290 --> 15:51.489
You're not wearing\Nthe slippers today.

16:03.910 --> 16:05.469
Your hand is dirty...

16:05.670 --> 16:07.180
with marks of\Na highlighter and pen.

16:07.680 --> 16:09.339
You have a pain relief\Npatch on your wrist.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.879
You unconsciously raise\Nyour heels when you walk,

16:12.009 --> 16:13.450
and it's become\Nyour habit.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.019
You do that because the\Nsound might bother others.

16:15.219 --> 16:17.650
You're different\Nfrom your friends.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.200
You write so much...

16:32.430 --> 16:34.440
that you've got a callus\Non your middle finger.

16:35.139 --> 16:36.139
Right?

16:36.739 --> 16:39.810
You've studied for the bar\Nexam for a very long time.

16:40.239 --> 16:41.580
And you got...

16:41.839 --> 16:43.379
this scar recently,

16:44.650 --> 16:45.650
right?

16:47.580 --> 16:49.690
- Goodness.\N- He demanded you...

16:49.690 --> 16:51.249
to pay 4,000 dollars just\Nbecause you stole a pen.

16:51.249 --> 16:52.450
That doesn't make\Nsense at all.

16:55.359 --> 16:57.229
Shall I report this\Nto the police?

16:57.330 --> 16:59.089
If you're an ex-convict,

16:59.089 --> 17:01.499
you can't pass the exam no\Nmatter how hard you study.

17:01.830 --> 17:04.569
But you had no choice\Nbut to be threatened.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.339
You were worried\Nabout your exam.

17:07.368 --> 17:09.269
Is he the culprit then?

17:12.539 --> 17:14.210
If you want to clear your\Nname from the suspicion,

17:14.210 --> 17:15.609
catch him already.

17:17.049 --> 17:18.509
Catch him.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.569
People won't\Nget killed easily...

17:37.569 --> 17:39.640
just by stabbing\Nwith a broken beer bottle.

17:40.100 --> 17:43.210
There are so many people\Naround us too.

17:43.739 --> 17:45.370
The cameras\Nhave captured you too.

17:45.870 --> 17:47.680
Give up now.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.479
What are you saying?

17:49.479 --> 17:51.410
Why would you talk about\Nthe camera at this timing?

17:51.410 --> 17:54.479
- Give me that camera.\N- I'll give it to you now.

17:54.519 --> 17:56.890
No. Go catch him already.

17:56.890 --> 17:58.120
What are you talking\Nabout? I can't catch him.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.489
I might get\Nkilled instead.

17:59.789 --> 18:01.289
People don't die\Nthat easily.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.390
Stop pushing me.

18:02.390 --> 18:03.529
Do it yourself.

18:10.829 --> 18:12.299
It's sharper...

18:12.870 --> 18:14.269
than I expected.

18:34.390 --> 18:35.460
Lee In Ho.

18:36.019 --> 18:38.989
Hey, Lee In Ho.

18:39.390 --> 18:40.400
Wake up.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.170
Lady.

18:47.999 --> 18:49.069
Lady.

18:49.539 --> 18:50.710
I caught Lee In Ho.

18:50.969 --> 18:52.710
I knew he was in the room.

18:52.710 --> 18:54.009
Is he the culprit?

19:01.880 --> 19:02.950
What is it now?

19:03.519 --> 19:04.890
Are you going to\Nstab her with that?

19:05.090 --> 19:06.259
Go ahead.

19:06.420 --> 19:07.519
Do it.

19:10.289 --> 19:11.329
Be careful!

19:22.940 --> 19:24.269
Don't kill the culprit!

19:24.440 --> 19:26.479
I did it all.\NI caught the culprit.

19:26.479 --> 19:27.579
I did it all!

19:28.009 --> 19:29.380
I might just\Nbeat you to a pulp.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.509
Do you know how much\NI suffered because of you?

19:33.880 --> 19:35.279
Where do you think\Nyou're going?

19:36.819 --> 19:38.019
You can't go anywhere.

19:38.019 --> 19:39.989
I didn't do anything.

19:40.690 --> 19:42.519
I'm innocent!

19:47.860 --> 19:49.769
I did nothing.

19:49.769 --> 19:51.600
What do you mean, punk?

19:51.769 --> 19:53.039
You took drugs.

19:54.969 --> 19:56.039
Why did you kill...

19:57.110 --> 19:58.269
your grandpa?

19:58.710 --> 19:59.710
What?

19:59.910 --> 20:01.340
I thought\Nhe was the culprit.

20:01.579 --> 20:04.009
She said that he was\Nthe culprit a while ago.

20:05.009 --> 20:06.549
It's him who killed\Nmy grandpa,

20:07.219 --> 20:08.719
not me.

20:09.019 --> 20:10.719
You killed him.

20:11.519 --> 20:13.319
I was in Gangnam that day.

20:14.890 --> 20:17.960
What?\NWhich one is the culprit?

20:18.190 --> 20:19.799
He has a cast on his arm.

20:19.799 --> 20:21.229
I don't think\Nhe could kill a man.

20:21.229 --> 20:22.729
Is it him then?

20:23.069 --> 20:25.269
But why did he kill\Nhis friend's grandpa?

20:25.269 --> 20:26.440
They are...

20:27.840 --> 20:29.670
not just friends.

20:29.739 --> 20:31.009
Lee In Ho hired him\Nto murder the victim.

20:32.069 --> 20:33.710
You went to Gangnam\Non purpose...

20:34.009 --> 20:35.440
to make up an alibi.

20:35.680 --> 20:36.680
You made...

20:37.180 --> 20:38.779
another person\Ncommit the murder.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.019
He hired him...

20:40.479 --> 20:41.850
to kill the victim.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.350
They were cornered\Nbecause they needed money,

20:46.019 --> 20:47.259
so they conspired\Nthis together.

20:47.519 --> 20:49.420
They're horrible jerks.

21:04.140 --> 21:05.640
What's this?\NIt's so brutal.

21:07.210 --> 21:08.210
I'm scared.

21:10.809 --> 21:12.450
By the way,\Nhow did you know...

21:12.450 --> 21:14.219
they were accomplices only\Nafter watching the video?

21:15.249 --> 21:17.249
They don't fit each other.

21:18.850 --> 21:21.390
One is a poor examinee...

21:21.390 --> 21:23.130
who stole an item\Nbecause he had no money.

21:23.989 --> 21:26.430
The other is a student\Nwho studies in England...

21:26.430 --> 21:27.729
and would inherit\Na huge amount of money...

21:27.729 --> 21:28.999
if his grandpa died. They\Nsuddenly became close.

21:29.329 --> 21:30.499
Don't you think\Nit's suspicious?

21:30.499 --> 21:31.499
(Ino DC Mart)

21:37.670 --> 21:40.880
He'd inherit\Nthe money anyway,

21:40.910 --> 21:41.940
so why did he kill\Nhis grandpa?

21:43.249 --> 21:44.749
Maybe it's\Nbecause of the cast.

21:45.610 --> 21:48.150
- The cast?\N- He got the cast...

21:48.319 --> 21:51.049
almost at the same time...

21:51.049 --> 21:53.860
when he got his aggressive\Nfriends of different ages.

21:56.090 --> 21:57.660
Bring us the money\Nif you don't want to die.

21:57.660 --> 21:59.090
We know your grandpa\Nis rich.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.529
He must've been threatened\Nregarding the money issue.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.430
How did you know?

22:04.430 --> 22:07.469
People's tastes\Ndon't change easily.

22:07.640 --> 22:10.610
I knew when I saw\Nhis necklace, earrings,

22:10.610 --> 22:13.039
and watch all\Ndisappear at once.

22:18.079 --> 22:19.450
Oh, right. That video.

22:22.019 --> 22:24.890
I'll be late because\Nof the questioning.

22:24.890 --> 22:26.090
So what?

22:26.090 --> 22:27.259
See you at home.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.529
At home? See me?

22:31.489 --> 22:33.999
At home? Wait, you two?

22:34.329 --> 22:36.160
Why? At home?

22:36.370 --> 22:37.670
Do you two live together?

22:38.829 --> 22:41.499
I'm hungry because\NI suddenly had to run.

22:41.499 --> 22:43.039
You're suddenly hungry?

22:43.039 --> 22:46.210
He's so careless\Nfor a detective.

22:46.210 --> 22:47.610
What? What did you say?

23:12.870 --> 23:14.640
I caught\NLee Wang Sik's murderer.

23:15.799 --> 23:17.370
You should let go...

23:17.840 --> 23:19.910
of the innocent Ms. Yoon,\NMr. Gye.

23:20.309 --> 23:21.840
Stop ordering me around.

23:22.479 --> 23:23.809
My gosh.

23:24.779 --> 23:27.249
Okay. Good job.

23:27.519 --> 23:28.719
- Thanks.\N- Mr. Gye.

23:28.719 --> 23:30.090
Is the interrogation\Nroom empty?

23:30.090 --> 23:31.549
Let me use it, okay?

23:36.489 --> 23:38.759
- Here are your waffles.\N- Thank you.

23:38.759 --> 23:40.660
I still\Ncan't believe this.

23:40.660 --> 23:42.529
Why did he do\Nsomething that bad?

23:42.529 --> 23:44.170
They weren't even friends.

23:44.799 --> 23:48.370
He was caught stealing\Non a video at Ino DC Mart.

23:49.370 --> 23:51.640
He was threatened\Nwith that, right?

23:52.539 --> 23:54.840
Ino DC Mart\Nis infamous for that.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.210
Shall I report this\Nto the police?

23:57.850 --> 23:59.650
If you're an ex-convict,

23:59.979 --> 24:02.219
you can't pass the exam no\Nmatter how hard you study.

24:02.219 --> 24:03.350
You know, right?

24:03.489 --> 24:08.319
That means you will\Nlive like this for life.

24:14.499 --> 24:17.069
There's no security camera\Nor people in this alley.

24:17.969 --> 24:20.140
The karaoke closes\Nat 2:30am.

24:20.269 --> 24:23.039
Do it before 3:30am, when\Nkids begin to go study.

24:35.219 --> 24:36.390
Grandpa.

24:37.819 --> 24:39.519
- Happy birthday.\N- What?

24:55.999 --> 24:57.969
I should take a picture.

25:05.410 --> 25:07.479
You got your grandpa\Nthis T-shirt.

25:07.950 --> 25:09.079
Do you remember?

25:12.989 --> 25:16.489
There was a weird point\Nin that picture.

25:17.029 --> 25:18.630
A point was\Ngiven to the picture?

25:19.559 --> 25:20.900
A weird point.

25:23.769 --> 25:25.430
The present\Nis a brand-name product,

25:25.430 --> 25:28.170
but the cake is from\Na convenience store.

25:30.140 --> 25:31.410
Listen carefully.

25:31.670 --> 25:34.940
A brand-name T-shirt and\Na convenience store cake.

25:35.809 --> 25:37.079
Sounds odd, doesn't it?

25:37.850 --> 25:38.950
What's odd?

25:38.950 --> 25:41.150
It feels like he is\Nusing his birthday...

25:41.950 --> 25:43.749
as an excuse to\Ngive him that T-shirt.

25:44.049 --> 25:46.489
This brand-name T-shirt\Nis 740 dollars.

25:46.489 --> 25:48.489
It has tropical fruits\Non the front.

25:49.519 --> 25:52.860
But this T-shirt\Nwas a bit different.

25:58.069 --> 25:59.370
Why is this so expensive?

25:59.370 --> 26:00.569
(740 dollars)

26:03.069 --> 26:04.170
The orange.

26:05.110 --> 26:06.680
The color of\Nthe orange is different.

26:08.779 --> 26:10.410
You colored it\Nwith luminous paint...

26:10.850 --> 26:12.279
so that he can be\Neasily seen at night.

26:35.870 --> 26:36.940
Sir.

26:49.519 --> 26:51.249
I already let you off.

26:51.249 --> 26:52.850
I can't do that anymore.

26:54.360 --> 26:56.989
How dare you glare at me?

26:56.989 --> 26:58.489
You impudent jerk.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.130
It was right on\Nthe aorta ventralis,

27:03.469 --> 27:05.499
above the belly button,\Nwhere he got his surgery.

27:07.299 --> 27:08.739
What's this wound?

27:09.539 --> 27:10.710
It's from a surgery.

27:10.710 --> 27:13.079
That's where\Nthe aorta ventralis are.

27:13.110 --> 27:15.110
It was to help him\Nexactly stab...

27:15.110 --> 27:17.979
the aorta ventralis\Neven in a dark alley.

27:21.579 --> 27:24.890
It was a perfect idea\Nas a fashion student.

27:25.350 --> 27:27.860
I'm so full.\NI can't eat anymore.

27:28.259 --> 27:29.390
What's this?

27:31.289 --> 27:33.100
It's my favorite, mango.

27:33.100 --> 27:34.229
Do you have another one?

27:34.229 --> 27:35.499
What are you doing?

27:35.499 --> 27:37.069
You said\Nyou can't eat anymore.

27:37.069 --> 27:38.700
This is what I eat\Nfor my health.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.940
You don't look like you\Ncare about your health.

27:40.940 --> 27:41.969
What are you doing?

27:44.009 --> 27:46.779
Theft isn't anything huge.\NThat right there is it.

27:46.779 --> 27:47.979
I was still talking.

27:48.610 --> 27:50.779
After he stabbed\NLee Wang Sik...

28:12.200 --> 28:14.269
Then you went to\NLee In Ho's house,

28:14.269 --> 28:16.140
which is on the top floor\Nof Ino Building,

28:16.140 --> 28:17.670
to not get caught\Non security cameras.

28:18.170 --> 28:19.340
How did you know?

28:19.640 --> 28:21.610
Well, a bit of reasoning?

28:28.479 --> 28:29.920
Goodbye. I'm leaving.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.719
Okay. Bye.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.460
Ms. Yoo.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.930
May I call you\Nfrom time to time?

28:42.299 --> 28:45.829
I mean, we can share\Ninformation on the exam.

28:47.340 --> 28:48.370
Sure.

28:49.469 --> 28:50.610
Goodness.

28:50.610 --> 28:53.410
It'll be so hectic to get\Nin the line from tomorrow.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.410
Are you interested\Nin a boarding institute?

28:58.049 --> 29:00.519
You don't have to line up\Nif you go there.

29:00.579 --> 29:01.650
A boarding institute?

29:01.650 --> 29:04.319
Yes, my uncle opened one\Nin Gangwon Province.

29:04.319 --> 29:06.690
The passing rate there\Nis about 90 percent.

29:07.289 --> 29:08.390
90 percent?

29:08.390 --> 29:11.460
Yes. So pretty much\Nno one fails.

29:14.200 --> 29:15.600
Is that so?

29:17.630 --> 29:18.870
What's with that face?

29:22.469 --> 29:23.910
They said\Nthey'll kill me...

29:24.640 --> 29:26.309
if I don't bring money\Nnext time.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.420
Bring us the money\Nif you don't want to die.

29:39.590 --> 29:41.219
We know your grandpa\Nis rich.

29:45.289 --> 29:46.829
Still, how can you\Nkill your grandpa?

29:47.400 --> 29:49.569
He just needed to sell\NIno Building.

29:49.930 --> 29:51.930
He was going to\Ngive it to me anyway.

29:52.670 --> 29:54.600
You killed your grandpa.

29:54.600 --> 29:56.069
I didn't kill him!

29:56.069 --> 29:58.370
You get punished the same\Nfor murder instigation.

29:58.370 --> 30:00.539
He wasn't doing well\Nafter the surgery.

30:01.739 --> 30:03.880
He wasn't going to\Nlive for long anyway.

30:09.350 --> 30:10.519
Detective.

30:10.719 --> 30:12.920
May I go home\Nfor just a short while?

30:14.559 --> 30:16.160
I left something\Nimportant there.

30:17.690 --> 30:18.960
What is it?

30:19.860 --> 30:20.960
Cocaine?

30:21.630 --> 30:22.660
Meth?

30:22.660 --> 30:25.529
Just once.\NI just need it once.

30:29.569 --> 30:31.009
Look at this face.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.239
Look at\Nhow happy he was...

30:34.079 --> 30:35.880
with the T-shirt\Nyou bought him.

30:37.779 --> 30:39.719
Look at him, you jerk.

30:42.650 --> 30:44.989
You killed\Nyour grandpa twice.

31:31.499 --> 31:32.600
(Intro to Criminal\NProcedure Code)

31:56.019 --> 31:57.059
Tofu.

32:03.870 --> 32:05.600
I heard you must eat tofu\Nwhen you get out.

32:08.039 --> 32:09.870
It's not like\NI've been to a jail.

32:12.809 --> 32:14.140
They told me...

32:15.680 --> 32:16.979
that the old man...

32:19.110 --> 32:21.120
grabbed my shoe\Nto ask for help.

32:21.979 --> 32:23.450
I didn't know...

32:23.620 --> 32:25.289
because I was listening\Nto a lecture.

32:26.719 --> 32:28.519
If I knew,

32:30.329 --> 32:31.829
I could've saved him.

32:35.360 --> 32:36.900
What am I doing\Nwith my life?

32:40.640 --> 32:43.069
I wanted to become\Na good police officer.

32:44.809 --> 32:46.579
But I didn't even\Nnotice...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.910
the dying person\Nwho grabbed my foot.

32:50.579 --> 32:52.479
You can be more attentive\Nfrom now on.

32:54.749 --> 32:56.019
If I...

32:57.690 --> 33:00.160
had paid more attention...

33:00.160 --> 33:02.759
No. You couldn't have\Ndone anything.

33:03.160 --> 33:04.690
You were just unlucky.

33:04.690 --> 33:06.090
Everything will pass.

33:06.430 --> 33:07.700
Just think that way.

33:14.600 --> 33:16.340
When I was in the lockup,

33:16.969 --> 33:18.969
I had this thought.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.680
"Can I be\Na good officer..."

33:22.739 --> 33:24.350
"if I became one?"

33:26.079 --> 33:27.380
I'm already thinking...

33:27.680 --> 33:29.650
only for myself.

33:31.150 --> 33:33.860
I'm only thinking about\Nsurviving the competition.

33:39.190 --> 33:41.299
Would I change\Nif I became an officer?

33:46.069 --> 33:47.700
So from now on,

33:48.569 --> 33:50.640
I'll pay attention\Nto things around me.

33:52.170 --> 33:54.309
I'll look at people\Nwho pass by me.

33:55.940 --> 33:58.950
Sometimes I'll look up\Nat the night sky.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.920
And I'll meet people...

34:03.489 --> 34:05.650
and have delicious\Ncoffee too.

34:05.890 --> 34:07.890
Yes. That's good.

34:09.929 --> 34:11.090
Take this tofu.

34:11.590 --> 34:12.900
They say it'll make you\Na kinder person.

34:17.699 --> 34:19.940
Hello, Detective Ha.

34:19.998 --> 34:21.300
You've done well.

34:21.670 --> 34:23.239
I just did what\Na detective should do.

34:23.610 --> 34:24.610
Mr. Gye.

34:25.110 --> 34:26.840
Let's investigate well.

34:27.210 --> 34:29.380
It's okay if we don't\Ncatch 100 criminals,

34:29.380 --> 34:31.880
but it's not okay to\Narrest an innocent person.

34:31.909 --> 34:33.320
You heard the news\Nfrom Manager Jo, right?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.079
- Congratulations.\N- What news?

34:36.820 --> 34:38.050
What?

34:41.219 --> 34:42.460
Let's have some tea.

34:43.329 --> 34:44.329
Okay.

34:51.768 --> 34:53.340
- There.\N- Thank you.

34:54.940 --> 34:56.940
Manager Jo.\NPlease add more water.

34:56.940 --> 34:59.039
Sure.

34:59.039 --> 35:00.579
There.

35:02.309 --> 35:05.349
Detective Ha.\NYou're amazing.

35:05.510 --> 35:06.519
You solved...

35:06.519 --> 35:08.579
so many cases since you\Ncame to Joongjin Station.

35:08.820 --> 35:10.720
I feel sorry for Mr. Gye.

35:10.720 --> 35:12.289
People will say\Nhe doesn't measure up.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.519
I stand out too much.

35:14.860 --> 35:16.829
It must be uneasy\Nfor you too.

35:16.829 --> 35:18.090
Not at all.

35:18.090 --> 35:19.460
My sixth sense.

35:19.860 --> 35:21.929
It never gets dull.

35:25.699 --> 35:28.139
Gosh, it's too watery.

35:32.170 --> 35:34.079
That's why\Nall the unit leaders...

35:35.710 --> 35:36.710
What about them?

35:38.309 --> 35:39.920
Do they talk\Nbehind my back?

35:41.579 --> 35:42.720
Everyone...

35:43.349 --> 35:45.619
wants you in their unit.

35:45.619 --> 35:48.420
Sir. I'm a loyal guy.

35:48.619 --> 35:50.960
I won't leave\NViolent Crimes Unit One.

35:54.760 --> 35:55.760
Detective Ha.

35:56.499 --> 35:59.499
Violent Crimes\NUnit One is nice,

35:59.769 --> 36:02.300
but considering\Nyour caliber,

36:02.940 --> 36:06.210
I don't think\Nyou belong there.

36:06.210 --> 36:07.940
Unit One is the ace.

36:07.940 --> 36:09.510
Unit Two is the ace.

36:09.809 --> 36:11.349
Unit Two\Nhas been dispatched.

36:11.349 --> 36:12.409
There's nobody\Nin Unit Two.

36:12.710 --> 36:14.920
Only the sloppy ones\Nget the desk job.

36:14.920 --> 36:18.190
Unit Two is dispatched\Nbecause it's the ace.

36:26.429 --> 36:27.760
(Ha Ji Seung)

36:29.869 --> 36:32.329
It's the first Dongban\Ncharity event.

36:32.630 --> 36:33.699
You'll come, right?

36:35.440 --> 36:37.139
It took my uncle...

36:37.139 --> 36:38.809
three years\Nto find the property.

36:38.809 --> 36:39.909
Take a look.

36:41.710 --> 36:43.979
Why are you\Nin Noryang-dong then?

36:43.979 --> 36:44.979
What?

36:46.010 --> 36:48.650
Well, I don't like\Nthe girls there.

36:48.650 --> 36:51.720
It's not just about\Nnot liking them.

36:52.190 --> 36:53.990
They're scary. Gosh.

36:54.789 --> 36:56.789
(Cheongryul Institution)

36:57.090 --> 36:58.690
It's deep\Nin the mountains.

36:58.729 --> 37:01.429
You have to walk two hours\Nto get to a bus stop.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.699
Also, there's no\Ncellphone service.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.269
(Cheongryul Institution)

37:11.970 --> 37:14.110
I guess all you can do\Nis study.

37:14.539 --> 37:16.249
They have a gym...

37:16.249 --> 37:17.979
and personal trainers too.

37:22.249 --> 37:23.990
Commute time\Nto Noryang-dong.

37:24.289 --> 37:25.749
Time spent\Ngoing to cafeteria.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.260
Time spent going to a gym.

37:27.659 --> 37:28.920
I can save all that time.

37:28.920 --> 37:31.360
That's why many people\Nfrom there pass the exam.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.300
Also...

37:33.300 --> 37:35.530
you can be admitted\Nevery three months.

37:35.530 --> 37:36.530
Wait a minute.

37:37.229 --> 37:38.530
Let's see.

37:39.130 --> 37:40.639
It's tomorrow. Tomorrow is\Nthe admission day.

37:40.639 --> 37:42.199
You don't have to wait.

37:42.909 --> 37:44.010
If I don't go tomorrow,

37:44.639 --> 37:46.010
do I have to wait\Nthree months?

37:46.010 --> 37:47.309
Yes. If you're interested,

37:47.309 --> 37:48.780
I'll talk to my uncle.

37:48.780 --> 37:50.979
You can probably get...

37:51.179 --> 37:53.280
a 50 percent discount.

37:53.920 --> 37:54.979
50 percent?

38:03.090 --> 38:04.190
I can save...

38:04.889 --> 38:07.760
2,500 dollars\Nper three months then.

38:15.039 --> 38:16.170
Okay.

(View Balance)

38:20.780 --> 38:21.780
(PIN Number)

38:26.519 --> 38:27.679
What?

38:28.019 --> 38:30.150
I'll be left with\Nonly 29 dollars.

38:30.190 --> 38:32.019
Press "done" if you're\Ndone with the transaction.

38:32.019 --> 38:35.389
Press other buttons if you\Nwant to continue.

38:35.389 --> 38:36.889
Take your card with you.

38:43.199 --> 38:44.229
Right.

38:45.869 --> 38:47.800
I have to pass this time.

38:48.840 --> 38:51.210
Otherwise, I'll be doomed.

38:55.139 --> 38:56.409
Let's pass,\Nno matter what.

38:56.849 --> 38:57.849
Okay?

39:02.150 --> 39:03.949
Please select\Nthe transaction...

39:03.990 --> 39:04.990

Thank you.

Ji Seung.

39:11.729 --> 39:13.599
Hey. You're here.

39:13.929 --> 39:15.229
You put a lot of work\Ninto this.

39:19.269 --> 39:20.639
I smell something fishy.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.400
What?

39:23.039 --> 39:24.610
I sense a woman's touch.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.170
Do you have a girlfriend?

39:27.880 --> 39:29.610
You're throwing me\Na lot of surprises.

39:29.949 --> 39:32.409
You became the president\Nof Ha and Jung Law Firm.

39:32.710 --> 39:34.249
You founded\Na public trust.

39:34.449 --> 39:36.050
Plus you got\Na secret girlfriend.

39:36.590 --> 39:38.519
I don't have a girlfriend.

39:38.519 --> 39:39.990
Don't lie to me.

39:40.590 --> 39:42.119
You know my nickname is\NSeodong's Sniffer.

39:49.260 --> 39:50.269
What's going on?

39:51.300 --> 39:52.400
We're from\NSeoul District...

39:52.400 --> 39:53.470
Public Prosecutors'\NOffice.

39:53.639 --> 39:54.999
The public trust...

39:54.999 --> 39:56.170
is charged\Nfor evasion of taxes.

39:56.170 --> 39:57.170
Please come with us.

39:57.170 --> 39:59.110
- Why don't we talk...\N- Wait.

39:59.470 --> 40:00.710
I think there is\Na misunderstanding.

40:00.710 --> 40:01.909
Let me handle this.

40:01.909 --> 40:02.949
Don't worry.

40:03.210 --> 40:04.710
- I'll come with you.\N- Okay.

40:04.710 --> 40:05.809
Let's go.

40:07.949 --> 40:10.190
Wan Seung,\Ntake care of Dad.

40:12.019 --> 40:13.119
Get out of the way.

40:14.190 --> 40:16.429
The public trust was\Nfounded only a month ago.

40:16.889 --> 40:18.159
But it's charged for\Ntax evasion?

40:20.360 --> 40:21.400
That's strange.

40:30.869 --> 40:31.909
Secretary Kim.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.409
President Ha\Nhas been arrested.

40:35.809 --> 40:37.650
He's headed to\Nthe prosecutors' office.

40:39.650 --> 40:40.650
Yes.

40:43.490 --> 40:46.460
The president of\NHa and Jung Law Firm...

40:46.720 --> 40:50.260
was arrested\Nfor evasion of taxes...

40:50.360 --> 40:52.460
at a public trust charity\Nevent this afternoon.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.300
He's scared.

40:57.170 --> 40:58.499
Don't worry.

40:59.199 --> 41:00.269
I'm making...

41:01.139 --> 41:03.470
a very special cake.

41:03.740 --> 41:06.880
The public trust\Nwas founded...

41:23.690 --> 41:26.429
The new president of\NHa and Jung Law Firm...

41:26.429 --> 41:28.400
who founded Dongban,

41:28.400 --> 41:31.400
a public network\Nthat supports...

41:31.400 --> 41:33.670
the victims of crimes,\Nwas arrested...

41:33.670 --> 41:34.869
for tax evasion.

41:35.269 --> 41:38.440
The former president\Nof Ha and Jung...

41:38.440 --> 41:41.380
had been implicated in\Na murder case last year.

41:49.119 --> 41:50.720
(Ha Jae Ho)

42:20.650 --> 42:23.519
I've never imagined he'd\Nbecome that weak.

42:24.849 --> 42:26.490
They don't allow\Nany visitors.

42:28.019 --> 42:29.690
Knowing my dad collapsed,

42:29.929 --> 42:31.460
they seem to be\Ncornering my brother.

42:34.499 --> 42:35.829
Make way.

42:37.630 --> 42:40.039
He didn't have great\Npublic opinions on him.

42:40.599 --> 42:42.470
It was going\Nto happen one day anyway.

42:43.110 --> 42:44.440
I don't have\Na good feeling about this.

42:45.710 --> 42:47.579
I got your back.

42:47.909 --> 42:50.010
I'm looking into it,\Nso don't worry.

42:50.079 --> 42:51.550
When will\Nmy jjajangmyeon be ready?

42:51.550 --> 42:52.679
I told you we could\Norder food,

42:52.679 --> 42:53.820
so why would you\Nmake a fuss?

42:53.820 --> 42:55.280
It'll be ready\Nin a second.

42:56.119 --> 42:57.619
Gosh, I want\Nto cook you...

42:57.619 --> 42:58.990
something delicious\Nafter a while,

42:58.990 --> 43:00.220
and you're so impatient.

43:03.159 --> 43:05.659
(Dong Ho's Lunch Box)

43:08.099 --> 43:11.170
Before Kyung Mi\Ncomes back,

43:11.300 --> 43:12.900
I'll pass the exam...

43:12.900 --> 43:14.940
and normalize\Nthe store too.

43:14.940 --> 43:15.940
(We're on holiday...)

43:15.940 --> 43:16.970
(until the owner passes\Nthe police exam.)

43:16.970 --> 43:19.139
I can do this!

43:24.179 --> 43:25.710
Here.

43:27.749 --> 43:28.849
Goodness.

43:30.690 --> 43:31.749
What do you think?

43:32.019 --> 43:34.590
What do you mean? It's\Ntypical jjajangmyeon.

43:36.590 --> 43:37.889
Try it already.

43:49.139 --> 43:50.570
It's amazing.

43:50.570 --> 43:51.710
Right?

43:53.340 --> 43:54.740
It's delicious.

43:55.780 --> 43:57.579
Did you find out\Nabout Secretary Kim?

43:57.579 --> 44:00.849
Well, people all\Nsay differently.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.789
Some people say\Nthat person is a woman,

44:04.789 --> 44:06.820
while the others say it's\Na young man or an old man.

44:06.820 --> 44:08.220
I know such rumors\Nabout...

44:08.220 --> 44:10.190
whether\NSecretary Kim was...

44:10.190 --> 44:11.590
a politician, an arms\Ndealer, a lobbyist,

44:11.590 --> 44:13.829
or an agent of National\NIntelligence Service.

44:13.829 --> 44:14.860
Do you?

44:15.729 --> 44:17.530
You aren't\Nas good as before.

44:17.530 --> 44:20.869
Then what are you doing at\NJoongjin Police Station?

44:21.440 --> 44:22.699
What have you found out?

44:22.699 --> 44:23.740
You said you'd get...

44:23.740 --> 44:24.909
some information\Nfrom Chief Shin.

44:24.909 --> 44:27.110
I have to get close with\Nhim to get information.

44:27.110 --> 44:29.110
Then flatter him a bit,

44:29.110 --> 44:31.050
and try to win his favor.

44:31.849 --> 44:33.720
Is it that hard?

44:33.720 --> 44:36.019
He has to give me\Nsome slack first.

44:36.019 --> 44:38.349
He treats me as if\NI'm a nobody.

44:39.990 --> 44:41.760
- Hello, sir.\N- Yes?

44:42.260 --> 44:43.289
I see.

45:01.280 --> 45:03.809
I should make a move\Nto make some progress.

45:05.309 --> 45:07.150
It seems like you've\Nalready made a move.

45:07.150 --> 45:08.220
Whatever.

45:08.979 --> 45:13.059
I heard Chief Shin goes\Nto Joongjin Church often.

45:13.059 --> 45:14.289
You'll get information\Nabout Secretary Kim...

45:14.289 --> 45:15.559
through Chief Shin?

45:15.619 --> 45:18.490
What do you mean? I should\Nbe introduced.

45:18.559 --> 45:20.159
He won't introduce you\Nto that person easily.

45:21.499 --> 45:23.929
You know I'm\Nvery sociable.

45:31.369 --> 45:33.079
It's really good.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.349
Oh, right.

45:45.889 --> 45:47.860
They allow students\Nto wear uniforms only.

45:48.820 --> 45:49.990
Then...

45:52.260 --> 45:53.559
And this.

46:07.610 --> 46:08.679
Dad.

46:09.510 --> 46:11.849
I'll pass the exam\Nfor certain this time.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.720
I'll really become\Na police officer.

46:26.929 --> 46:28.960
Let's part ways\Nfor a while...

46:29.900 --> 46:31.429
until I pass the exam.

46:32.099 --> 46:33.170
Goodbye.

46:41.740 --> 46:42.740
Hi.

46:43.349 --> 46:45.079
- Hi.\N- You're here.

46:45.380 --> 46:46.949
Is that all your stuff?

46:46.949 --> 46:48.050
What's this car?

46:48.050 --> 46:49.050
It's my friend's car.

46:49.050 --> 46:50.550
Come out, and say hello.

46:50.550 --> 46:51.749
He's Dae Woon.

46:51.749 --> 46:52.990
He registered\Nfor the institution too.

46:52.990 --> 46:54.820
You can go with him.\NCome here.

46:59.829 --> 47:00.929
Is she your girlfriend?

47:00.929 --> 47:02.159
What are you\Ntalking about?

47:02.159 --> 47:03.630
You guys are\Nfriends indeed.

47:04.630 --> 47:05.670
Did you make\Na group order?

47:05.670 --> 47:07.900
What, the glasses? Yes.

47:09.369 --> 47:10.970
Tell you friend...

47:10.970 --> 47:13.179
to take off those glasses\Nright now...

47:13.179 --> 47:15.510
and get his hands off me.

47:15.510 --> 47:17.909
He's right next to you,\Nso tell him directly.

47:17.909 --> 47:19.150
Are you shy of strangers?

47:19.150 --> 47:21.019
Get your arm off her,\Nand take off your glasses.

47:21.019 --> 47:22.619
She's a scary lady.

47:22.619 --> 47:24.690
A strange mister follows\Nher around all the time,

47:24.690 --> 47:27.360
and he calls himself\Na dog.

47:27.360 --> 47:29.889
You might get bitten,\Nso take that away.

47:31.690 --> 47:34.530
Gosh, look at her teeth.\NDid you just see that?

47:34.530 --> 47:36.099
She's scary. You might\Nreally get bitten.

47:36.929 --> 47:37.999
Satisfied?

47:41.499 --> 47:42.769
Get in.

47:42.769 --> 47:45.170
Load the luggage\Nfor her too.

47:47.710 --> 47:48.740
What about you?

47:48.740 --> 47:50.610
I have to wrap up the\Ndocumentary in Noryang.

47:50.610 --> 47:52.150
I have a lot to do,\Nso go without me.

47:52.150 --> 47:53.179
Bye.

47:59.659 --> 48:01.220
Drive safely.

48:01.590 --> 48:03.360
Bye.

48:38.059 --> 48:40.300
She's home early.

48:42.030 --> 48:45.070
I knew it. I wondered\Nhow long she'd last.

48:45.470 --> 48:47.300
She's too old\Nto study now.

48:48.099 --> 48:50.010
She should behave and\Ncatch culprits instead.

48:55.380 --> 48:56.380
Lady.

48:57.280 --> 48:58.409
Lady?

49:00.749 --> 49:01.880
What's this?

49:05.849 --> 49:07.320
Did she make a meal?

49:15.559 --> 49:19.170
I wanted to make you\Na meal before I leave,

49:19.740 --> 49:21.499
but the admission\Nstarts tomorrow,

49:21.499 --> 49:22.800
so I don't have\Nenough time.

49:23.309 --> 49:25.269
I'm leaving my cellphone,

49:25.269 --> 49:26.780
so I might be out\Nof reach.

49:27.679 --> 49:31.010
I'll pass the exam\Nand come back.

49:31.449 --> 49:33.320
Keep the house safe.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.690
Is she out of her mind?

49:37.590 --> 49:38.749
A boarding institution?

49:39.619 --> 49:41.490
Studying in Noryang-dong\Nwas ridiculous,

49:41.619 --> 49:43.889
but now, she'll study\Nat a boarding institution?

49:44.130 --> 49:45.260
Goodness.

49:49.599 --> 49:52.099

50:04.449 --> 50:06.150
there's a boarding\Ninstitution around here?

50:06.479 --> 50:07.780
We're almost there.

Is that right?

50:21.499 --> 50:23.030
Why can't I sleep?

50:24.400 --> 50:26.369
This lady is so fearless.

50:27.369 --> 50:29.199
How could she leave\Nwithout any discussion?

50:31.210 --> 50:32.769
Did she get conned\Nby any chance?

50:33.909 --> 50:34.979
Or...

50:35.710 --> 50:37.949
was she deceived by\Norgan traffickers?

50:40.720 --> 50:42.479
I don't have to go to\NNoryang-dong tomorrow,

50:42.479 --> 50:43.619
but I still can't sleep.

You seem to be tired from\Ncatching culprits lately,

51:05.970 --> 51:07.409
so I've packed your things\Nup for you.

51:09.110 --> 51:11.449
You must feel\Nvery upset, Mr. Gye.

51:11.749 --> 51:13.280

51:14.720 --> 51:15.849

51:16.320 --> 51:17.550
I'll visit you often.

No, you don't have to.

- Manager Jo.\N- What is it?

52:25.849 --> 52:27.460
Is it true that\NI'm the only member...

If you needed\Na leader that badly,

52:39.130 --> 52:40.539
you should've\Nbehaved in Unit One.
