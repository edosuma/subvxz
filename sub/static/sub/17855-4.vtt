00:18.552 --> 00:20.554
- Whoo!

00:21.822 --> 00:23.557
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:23.591 --> 00:27.461
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:27.495 --> 00:28.829
Okay, first of all, there--

00:28.862 --> 00:30.698
yes, there is a pet adoption
in the lobby.

00:30.731 --> 00:34.168
Please don't adopt
any more animals.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.470
Also, we have a big show, guys.

00:36.504 --> 00:37.738
We got Michael J. Fox.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.140
- [gasps] MJ!
- Yeah.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.109
- He got snubbed
at the Oscars this year.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.510
- Oh, he wasn't up
for an Oscar.

00:42.543 --> 00:44.078
- Hey, can I--
can I hug MJ?

00:44.112 --> 00:45.846
- No.
- I'm going to.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.083
- Okay, so we also have
his lovely wife, Tracy Pollan.

00:49.117 --> 00:50.851
- Oh.
- And Jim Gaffigan.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.387
We got Jim again,
so it's a big, big, big show.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.256
Is that a wig
for Jim Gaffigan?

00:55.289 --> 00:56.457
- No, this is for my wife.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.825
We're going to salsa night
tonight.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.227
- [giggling]
- That's so great.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.394
- Fun.
- I know.

01:00.428 --> 01:01.662
- And, uh, Penny,

01:01.695 --> 01:02.830
Nippulini's coming today.

01:02.863 --> 01:04.098
Did you see his show?

01:04.132 --> 01:06.167
- I couldn't look.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.202
- Okay,
it's a big get for us,

01:08.236 --> 01:11.205
so I'm gonna let you
do the pre-interview today.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.773
- Um, I...
- You're welcome.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.542
- Appreciate that so much,

01:14.575 --> 01:17.645
and I know that that's a big
step forward in my career--

01:17.678 --> 01:20.781
- Marcus, uh, can you do
full-body makeup?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.550
- I have to do nipples?
- Nipples and ass.

01:22.583 --> 01:23.884
- I am definitely
not doing ass.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.819
I will only do nipples
if you buy me new brushes.

01:25.853 --> 01:26.820
- Okay, nipples.

01:26.854 --> 01:27.821
I'll do the ass.
- Great.

01:27.855 --> 01:28.822
- How are we with security

01:28.856 --> 01:30.158
with Michael J. Fox?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.525
- [whimpers]
Oh, oh...

01:31.559 --> 01:35.863
You know, standard operating
of the procedures.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.366
- Okay, um, great.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.868
Remember, uh, Jimmy
was on a bender last night,

01:40.901 --> 01:42.370
so he has
a bit of a headache.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.338
So don't talk to him, and--
Grady?

01:44.372 --> 01:45.739
- If you're done--are you done?
- Yes.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.807
- I asked if I could
bring up an issue.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.276
- Yes, please, please.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.377
- If I could have the room,
please.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.644
As some of you know,

01:50.678 --> 01:52.180
there's been a thief
amongst us.

01:52.213 --> 01:54.182
Someone is stealing
the wheat crackers.

01:54.215 --> 01:57.485
We all know the wheat crackers
are for the guests only.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.420
- This is a good point,
though.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.655
There is a lot of stealing
going on,

02:01.689 --> 02:04.758
and I feel like we should
get someone to address that.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.361
- Phil, this is something you
could probably help us with.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.597
- That just seems like
a lot of work, though.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.499
- Hey, can I say something
real quick?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.334
Uh, I just want to say,

02:13.367 --> 02:15.203
I think we're gonna have
a great show today.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.771
You know, Jimmy--I haven't
talked to Jimmy yet, but I will.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.273
I talk to him every day.

02:19.307 --> 02:21.509
So, yeah, have
a great show today.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.544
Uh, yesterday sucked.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.812
- Okay, that's the end
of the meeting.

02:24.845 --> 02:25.946
Everybody have a good show.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.615
- Thank you.
You too.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.250
- Thanks, Staci.
- Namaste.

02:29.283 --> 02:32.220
[indistinct chatter]

02:34.322 --> 02:37.325
- We have a show to do, people!
- Oh!

[energetic brass music]

male announcer:
From Studio 9B

02:40.261 --> 02:42.196
in the heart
of New York City,

02:42.230 --> 02:45.199
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

02:45.233 --> 02:46.734
Tonight, he's back
from the future

02:46.767 --> 02:48.436
with his family tie.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.804
It's Michael J. Fox
and Tracy Pollan.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.375
The world's palest comedian,
Jim Gaffigan.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.577
A man who lifts SUVs
with his boobies,

02:56.610 --> 02:58.446
The Great Nippulini.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.748
And now, number five
in the ratings

03:00.781 --> 03:02.550
but number one in our hearts,

03:02.583 --> 03:04.952
here's Jimmy.

03:04.985 --> 03:08.522
*

03:08.556 --> 03:10.491
- Let me tell you
something, Penny.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.394
If every celebrity was in rehab
that should be in rehab,

03:13.427 --> 03:14.895
we'd have no guests
on the show.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.364
- That's true.
- Uh, listen.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.665
There's somebody
who smells on the crew.

03:17.698 --> 03:18.832
I don't know who it is,

03:18.866 --> 03:20.901
but it smells like
a bag of dead cats.

03:20.934 --> 03:23.471
Find out who it is.
Celebrities hate a fetid stench.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.673
And also, there are no more
tampons in the ladies' room.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.807
- You still use tampons?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.509
- Yes, I still use tampons.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.510
- Wow.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.282
- Ahh!

03:34.315 --> 03:35.583
Penny, did I eat today?

03:35.616 --> 03:36.984
- Did you eat today?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.619
Let me check your log.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.021
Um, no, according
to your food log,

03:41.054 --> 03:42.990
you've only had
three throat lozenges.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.358
- Oh, my God.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.729
[sighs]
- Get into that banana.

03:48.762 --> 03:49.997
Um, I was thinking--

03:50.030 --> 03:51.432
you know how I monitor
your food?

03:51.465 --> 03:52.666
- Mm-hmm.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.967
- Well, last night,
I couldn't sleep,

03:54.001 --> 03:55.336
and I had this idea.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.670
What if I could monitor
your heart?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.506
'Cause I'm, like,
a little concerned

03:58.539 --> 04:00.308
that you're gonna
have a heart attack.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.377
- No, I've always said,
as soon as I took this job,

04:03.411 --> 04:04.878
I will die in this job,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.614
but it'll be
by my own hand.

04:06.647 --> 04:07.881
- Don't say such things.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.017
You are at very high risk,

04:10.050 --> 04:13.354
and I have a way
to fix the problem.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.622
- Oh, my God.

04:14.655 --> 04:15.823
- The Olsen twins
left their

04:15.856 --> 04:18.025
matching JimmyBits
last night,

04:18.058 --> 04:20.394
so I was thinking maybe
we could both wear them.

04:20.428 --> 04:23.731
- Penny, this is Jimmy
slapping his name on a Fitbit.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.333
- But they work.
They're incredible.

04:25.366 --> 04:26.767
- No, remember when
he made the juicer--

04:26.800 --> 04:27.935
the Jimmy Juicer...

04:27.968 --> 04:29.403
- The Jimmy Juicer was--

04:29.437 --> 04:30.704
- And everyone in props
lost their hand?

04:30.738 --> 04:32.005
- That was a hard day
for everyone.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.974
Morale was low.
But I wouldn't worry.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.844
Anyway, all you have to do
is download an app, and then--

04:36.877 --> 04:39.580
- Okay, whoa, I'm out.
I don't download apps.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.582
- That was foolish of me
to say "just."

04:41.615 --> 04:43.016
I will download
the app for you...

04:43.050 --> 04:44.318
- Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

04:44.352 --> 04:45.686
- And monitor your--
your health

04:45.719 --> 04:47.688
and your heart rate,
so all you have to do is move,

04:47.721 --> 04:49.557
and I'll get a sense of,
like, where you are,

04:49.590 --> 04:53.427
'cause right now, I would say
that you're barely breathing.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.896
So maybe if--would you--
- We're moving?

04:55.929 --> 04:57.898
- I hesitate to ask,
but could you stand?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.600
- Oh, God.
Do you know--

04:59.633 --> 05:01.435
I was an actress for six months
when I was young,

05:01.469 --> 05:03.537
and when there was movement
involved, I left.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.005
And by the way,
this is not doing anything.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.674
Can I just tell you
something?

05:06.707 --> 05:08.342
If you really want to get
your heart rate up...

05:08.376 --> 05:09.410
- Mm-hmm?

05:09.443 --> 05:10.544
[objects sliding
and clattering]

05:10.578 --> 05:11.912
- You do it
from the core.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.447
You twerk. You go.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.583
You go, you go.
Come on, Penny.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.418
You're actually
using your core.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.052
This is how you get
your heart rate up.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.721
- Oh, my God,
it's really working.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.823
- David Duchovny
taught me this.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.825
*

05:24.858 --> 05:26.894
Well, I can't tell you
how excited we are to get you.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.430
It's taken, like,
14 years to book you.

05:29.463 --> 05:33.066
- You've been on the air
for 14--eh, it'll be fine.

05:33.100 --> 05:36.370
- Anyway, this is your home away
from home for a little while.

05:36.404 --> 05:37.805
Make yourself comfortable.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.673
We have water,
which you can have.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.009
And there's that candy--
anything you would need.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.477
Um, we have a great show.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.513
We have, uh, Jim Gaffigan
coming...

05:45.546 --> 05:46.914
- Mm.
- Who you probably know.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.649
- He's funny.
- And The Great Nippulini.

05:48.682 --> 05:50.117
- Oh!
- You kidding me?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.552
- Fuck God.
- What?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.086
- Again with The Great
fucking Nippulini.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.788
- I-I love
The Great Nippulini.

05:54.822 --> 05:57.024
On my 50th birthday,
we flew to Paris to see him.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.126
I saw him pull a piano across
the stage with his scrotum.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.028
- That's--that's--

06:01.061 --> 06:02.630
- And they say he's working
on a thing uh, with his butt--

06:02.663 --> 06:04.598
a sphincter lift--
he can lift a small child.

06:04.632 --> 06:05.866
- Yeah, no, he's a--
he's really--

06:05.899 --> 06:07.100
he's a national treasure.

06:07.134 --> 06:09.102
- You know what?
I am so sick and tired...

06:09.136 --> 06:10.704
- What?

06:10.738 --> 06:13.941
- Of your obsession
with nipples and scrotum.

06:13.974 --> 06:15.809
- No, it's his--
his nipples and his scrotum.

06:15.843 --> 06:18.579
It's not--and your nipples.
- It's disgusting. Okay.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.581
- I don't talk to you about
your Justin Bieber fascination.

06:20.614 --> 06:21.949
- Okay, okay.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.851
- Obsession.
She loves short Canadians.

06:23.884 --> 06:27.455
Mike Myers is--
- Justin Bieber is not short.

06:27.488 --> 06:29.457
- He's shorter than me.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.491
He is;
he's shorter than me.

06:30.524 --> 06:31.925
Justin Bieber is shorter--

06:31.959 --> 06:33.627
- I don't--it's--
this is not my pl--

06:33.661 --> 06:34.862
this is something for your
therapist to deal with.

06:34.895 --> 06:35.863
- No, his new album
is really good.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.197
- Oh, fuck off.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.766
- So you guys
get yourself comfortable,

06:38.799 --> 06:40.434
and I'll be back
in a little while.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.935
- I haven't been comfortable
in 13 years.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.505
- Staci, Staci. Staci!

06:44.538 --> 06:46.907
The Great Nippulini
is here, so--

06:46.940 --> 06:48.909
- Okay, let's take a breath.
- [groaning]

06:48.942 --> 06:50.043
- In through your nose,

06:50.077 --> 06:51.512
out through your vagina.

06:51.545 --> 06:52.780
[sighs]
Now listen to me.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.047
We talked about it
this morning.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.916
You are talent.

06:55.949 --> 06:58.085
Now, put those
shoulders back,

06:58.118 --> 07:00.020
and you go tell
that nippled freak

07:00.053 --> 07:02.055
how a pre-interview
is done.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.992
*

07:06.059 --> 07:07.060
[knocking on door]

07:07.094 --> 07:08.195
- Come on in.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.165
- Hello, Mr. Nippulini.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.801
Welcome to "Nightcap."

07:13.834 --> 07:16.704
My name is Penny.
I work in t-talent department--

07:16.737 --> 07:17.971
I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

07:18.005 --> 07:19.239
- I don't mean to be rude.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.777
Um, I've just never seen,
like,

07:23.811 --> 07:26.146
metal from a man's bazoom.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.181
[snorting]
Sorry.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.584
Congratulations.

07:30.618 --> 07:31.885
What I'm here to do
right now

07:31.919 --> 07:33.887
is to walk you through
your segment.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.489
First thing
that's gonna happen

07:35.523 --> 07:37.124
is, Jimmy will say,

07:37.157 --> 07:38.992
"It's Mr. Nippulini!"

07:39.026 --> 07:41.495
The lights are gonna come on.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.996
Um...
[stammering]

07:43.030 --> 07:45.866
I don't know how
you're supporting it.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.736
Um, and then--ouch.

07:48.769 --> 07:52.673
And then you are going to...

07:52.706 --> 07:55.175
lift the, um, uh--

07:55.208 --> 07:56.176
I would call it an anvil.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.210
- That's an anvil.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.912
- Uh, you--I would lift it.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.848
You're gonna lift the anvil
with your nipples.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.082
[snorts]
Sorry.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.584
You're gonna lift it
with your nipples.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.952
- It's okay.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.820
- And that looks--
it just looks so heavy.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.155
[laughs]
- It's not that heavy.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.790
You can try to pick it up
if you want.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.091
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.526
- Um, okay.
- Here, I'll show you.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.561
[murmurs indistinctly]

08:13.594 --> 08:14.795
- Ouch!
Shit.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.530
Oh, God!
- Wait a minute, hold on--stop.

08:16.564 --> 08:17.965
- [screaming]
Oh, my God! No-no-no-no!

08:17.998 --> 08:19.967
No! Stop it! Stop moving!
- You stop moving.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.535
- Stop!
- Stop moving.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.103
- I've never been so close
to a nipple.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.972
- Down. Just stay still.
Stay still.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.607
- No! Ouch!
- Don't move. Don't move.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.608
- Ow!
Don't push me down!

08:28.909 --> 08:30.043
- Hi.
- Hey.

08:30.077 --> 08:31.879
- Hi, Jim.
- So I thought about it.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.013
- Yes.
- So here's what I'm gonna do.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.648
Do the doughnut story,

08:34.682 --> 08:37.618
and then after that,
um, I'll do the, um--

08:37.651 --> 08:39.152
remember, I talked about
avocados, so--

08:39.186 --> 08:41.088
- Very funny.
- Thanks, Tasha.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.724
- And then I'll do the,
uh--

08:43.757 --> 08:45.693
then I'll talk about,
uh, Ener-Jesus.

08:45.726 --> 08:47.060
Then I was thinking,

08:47.094 --> 08:48.762
then I'll talk about
the TV Land show...

08:48.796 --> 08:49.897
- I'm sorry.
I heard "Jesus."

08:49.930 --> 08:51.031
- Which is also
on Comedy Central,

08:51.064 --> 08:52.600
but people can get it online.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.334
- I'm sorry,
but the Jesus thing is a bit?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.670
- No, uh, the energy drink.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.271
- We didn't talk about that
on the phone.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.907
It's--don't worry.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.642
I know that it's a no-no,
like, the product thing,

09:01.675 --> 09:02.810
but this isn't a product.

09:02.843 --> 09:04.144
It's an energy drink.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.014
It combines the two things
that people love most,

09:07.047 --> 09:08.616
which is energy drinks

09:08.649 --> 09:10.718
and our Lord and Savior Jesus.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.985
So it's Ener-Jesus.

09:12.019 --> 09:14.855
And the slogan is,
"God, this tastes good."

09:14.888 --> 09:16.724
- I'm gonna--I'm gonna just
tell you right now...

09:16.757 --> 09:18.158
- Yeah.
- That Burbank will fire my ass

09:18.191 --> 09:20.728
if I let any kind of
product placement on the show.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.262
It's just better
if we do a little, like,

09:22.295 --> 09:24.598
B-roll of you playing
with your family, and--

09:24.632 --> 09:26.233
- Drinking the juice.

09:26.266 --> 09:28.235
- I don't think that we should
use the juice at all.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.369
- It's not technically juice.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.704
Like, there's no juice in it.

09:30.738 --> 09:31.872
So don't worry about that.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.774
But anyway, so what I love
about it is,

09:33.807 --> 09:37.277
it's Ener-Jesus,
and the thing is--is, like,

09:37.310 --> 09:39.647
I have kind of
a teenaged side to me.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.281
Like, if you put a hoodie
on me, you'd be like,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.016
"Oh, is he a skateboarder?"

09:43.050 --> 09:45.886
And so I was thinking maybe
I could come in on a skateboard

09:45.919 --> 09:49.056
with the juice and be like,
"Hey, what's up, bruh?"

09:49.089 --> 09:50.758
- I'm gonna say no, Jim,

09:50.791 --> 09:52.660
and I don't even have
to take it up to Jimmy.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.194
I just--
my hands are tied.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.764
Are you--are you making money
off of this?

09:56.797 --> 09:58.365
- I'm not making money
off of it.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.934
I mean, this is--
it's a business.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.270
I mean, this is--you know,
I mean, I'm, you know--

10:03.303 --> 10:05.105
unlike you,
I believe in God.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.907
I'm not going to hell...
- Oh, I don't--

10:06.940 --> 10:08.742
- So I have a juice
that is not a juice.

10:08.776 --> 10:10.043
It's an energy drink.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.311
I got 20 cases.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.681
And I was hoping to--
after the show--

10:13.714 --> 10:16.183
very dignified--
selling them to the audience.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.318
- Oh, I don't think
that's a good idea, Jim.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.787
- We don't have to be on air.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.988
- No, we're not allowed

10:21.021 --> 10:22.790
to have bake sales
in this place.

10:22.823 --> 10:23.791
- It's not a bake sale.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.693
- No. Absolutely not.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.295
You cannot sell your disgusting
religious drinks on our show.

10:28.328 --> 10:29.663
- Fine, I won't--
- Thank you.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.665
- I won't sell it.
I'll just--

10:31.699 --> 10:33.701
Fox News said I could do it.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.403
- Anyway, uh, our makeup girl
isn't in today,

10:36.436 --> 10:38.205
so if you wouldn't mind
just kind of doing

10:38.238 --> 10:40.207
your own foundation
and lip gloss...

10:40.240 --> 10:42.375
she's sick.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.377
- [sighs] Okay.
- Okay?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.213
[knocking on door]
- Oh, man.

10:46.246 --> 10:48.015
It's Doc Hollywood.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.783
Oh...
Hey, I'm Todd.

10:49.817 --> 10:50.984
I'm Jimmy's best friend.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.385
I'm a producer here.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.854
Creative stuff.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.288
You know, a bunch
of different things.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.290
Hey, can you sign
my stethoscope?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.793
'Cause this is--
this is one like you used

10:59.827 --> 11:01.128
on "Doc Hollywood."

11:01.161 --> 11:02.730
- Yeah, do you want me
to hold your water?

11:02.763 --> 11:04.397
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, you hold my water?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.333
- Sorry.
- Top three movies of all time.

11:06.366 --> 11:07.968
- What are the first two?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.703
- Oh, uh, "Godfather,"
"Doc Hollywood,"

11:09.737 --> 11:11.171
"Who Framed Roger Rabbit."

11:11.204 --> 11:12.706
- I have them in
the reverse order.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.241
- Oh, yeah.
- [laughing]

11:14.274 --> 11:15.909
- So where--hey, where do you
want me to sign this?

11:15.943 --> 11:17.277
- Uh, just sign it anywhere,
you know.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.846
You could sign it
right on the rubber.

11:18.879 --> 11:19.980
- It's black on black.
It's--

11:20.013 --> 11:21.281
- Yeah, I'll see it.
Yeah.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.716
- You know it's there.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.718
- Yeah, thank you so much.
- Okay.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.953
- Yeah, hey, before I leave,

11:25.986 --> 11:27.855
can you just flash me
real quick?

11:27.888 --> 11:29.356
Can you just do a little flash?
- What?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.024
- Like you did in
"Doc Hollywood"?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.860
- Oh--
- You know, when you flashed--

11:32.893 --> 11:34.327
- God, no, no, no.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.263
- Oh, could you--
- No, that wasn't me.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.865
- She wasn't in "Doc Hollywood."
- I wasn't in "Doc"--

11:37.898 --> 11:38.866
- You weren't in "Doc"--
- No.

11:38.899 --> 11:40.333
- Yeah, you were.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.468
- "Family Ties"--you're thinking
of "Family Ties."

11:41.501 --> 11:42.870
We met on "Family Ties."

11:42.903 --> 11:44.137
- I don't know
what that is.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.438
- It was a show.
It was in the '80s.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.506
- All right, cool, great.
- Oh, great.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.941
- Cool.
- Thank you.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.176
- Thank you.
- Special seeing you.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.510
- Oh, man--thank you.
- Okay, bye.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.213
- Oh, man.
- Um, anyway, so listen.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.415
We--I know you wanted us to do
this thing on Parkinson's.

11:55.448 --> 11:57.117
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.852
- But I feel like we've seen
that on every talk show.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.320
It's getting a little redundant.
- Wha--

12:00.353 --> 12:02.155
- So the writers had
this idea and thought,

12:02.189 --> 12:04.925
why don't we shoot you
out of a cannon?

12:04.958 --> 12:06.794
- You...
- [laughing] Oh, my God.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.362
- I-I--you want to shoot me
out of a cannon? Because I--

12:09.396 --> 12:11.799
- Yeah, I just--I feel like the
foundation's a bit of a yawn.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.366
- I have Parkinson's.
I don't know if I can--

12:13.400 --> 12:14.935
I don't know if my brain
can take that.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.103
- Oh, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.170
That is so funny.
Oh, my God.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.438
- What's funny?

12:18.471 --> 12:20.007
- It has been so long
since you've done

12:20.040 --> 12:21.341
something that's
actually funny.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.176
I mean, something that
other people will see.

12:23.210 --> 12:24.812
- Oh, well, there you go.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.146
The wife--
- That's great.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.414
Yeah, shoot me out
of a fuckin' cannon.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.916
- Yeah.
- Oh.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.217
- Shoot him out of a cannon.
I'd love that.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.185
- No, I--what am I saying?
No, no, no.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.187
No, no flashing,
no cannons.

12:34.221 --> 12:36.089
No, no--
- [laughing]

12:36.123 --> 12:38.025
That's funny too.
- [stammering] You're sick.

12:38.058 --> 12:39.960
I can't believe you're
the mother of my children.

12:42.095 --> 12:46.466
[lively trumpet music]

12:46.499 --> 12:49.469
- As a security guard,
you need a certain energy

12:49.502 --> 12:52.339
and a spirituality
to guide you through

12:52.372 --> 12:55.075
protecting the world
against the forces of evil.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.543
Wouldn't you agree?

12:56.576 --> 12:59.446
- Actually, I really barely
even use the energy

12:59.479 --> 13:01.081
that God gave me.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.017
- And it's also got
a terrific metallic taste.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.887
- I do love a good
metallic taste, actually.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.423
- What is going on here?

13:10.457 --> 13:12.559
Phil?
- Oh, nothing.

13:12.592 --> 13:15.262
- Um, this is where the sodas
and cantaloupe water go.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.297
This is my area.
I've arranged it.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.366
What are you doing in it?
- Um...

13:19.399 --> 13:22.602
- This seems like you guys
are gonna escalate into a fight,

13:22.635 --> 13:25.372
and that is my cue to exit.

13:25.405 --> 13:26.907
- Thank you, Phil.
- [chuckling]

13:26.940 --> 13:28.608
- Is this some
of your artwork?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.343
- This is all
of my artwork.

13:30.377 --> 13:33.346
- Could I steal one minute
and just run an idea by you,

13:33.380 --> 13:34.614
please?

13:34.647 --> 13:36.149
- All right.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.617
- You're obviously an artist,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.619
unlike the people around here.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.023
Are you familiar
with the idea of,

13:43.056 --> 13:44.992
if you sell three cans
of Ener-Jesus--

13:45.025 --> 13:46.927
- I'm gonna stop you there.
- Yeah.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.495
- This sounds like
a pyramid scheme.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.298
Am I wrong?
- Um, there--

13:51.331 --> 13:53.500
- I have always wanted to be
invited into a pyramid scheme,

13:53.533 --> 13:55.035
and I've never had the chance.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.503
- Well, then
we're in good luck here.

13:56.536 --> 13:57.971
And I'll tell you something.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.507
Between you and I, Grady,

14:00.540 --> 14:05.212
this building is filled
with some dumb fucking people.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.480
*

14:07.514 --> 14:10.150
- Should we have Val Kilmer on
just to prove he's not dead?

14:10.183 --> 14:12.252
- Wait, he's not dead?
- See, exactly.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.021
- Hey, it's me, Todd.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.655
You guys got a sec?
- Oh, God, no.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.524
Oh, Todd, we're so slammed
right now.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.026
- Bummer.
That's a bummer.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.894
I can't find
the fire marshal anywhere.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.395
So if you got, like,
a lost and found list,

14:22.429 --> 14:24.231
just throw him on there:
fire marshal.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.599
- Okay, um, I haven't even
convinced Michael J. Fox

14:26.633 --> 14:28.468
to do the sketch.
- Really?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.503
- I don't understand why Jimmy
thinks it's so funny.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.172
- I think it's funny.
- Okay.

14:32.205 --> 14:34.074
But Michael J. Fox is, like,
a national treasure.

14:34.107 --> 14:35.976
He's, like, a "New York Times"
best-selling author,

14:36.009 --> 14:37.410
and he's a movie star
and a TV star.

14:37.444 --> 14:38.578
He's a pioneer
in Parkinson's research.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.247
- From Canada, mm-hmm.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.149
- And I just think
it's a little degrading

14:42.182 --> 14:44.184
to light him
out of a cannon.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.020
- Jimmy wants it to happen,
so just make sure MJ

14:47.054 --> 14:50.057
just jumps in there,
and he flies out.

14:50.090 --> 14:52.692
- Let's call him Michael J. Fox
and not MJ.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.261
- Agree to disagree.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.596
[chuckling]

14:56.629 --> 14:58.498
Mm-mm-mm.

14:58.531 --> 15:02.402
*

15:04.104 --> 15:06.306
- Hey, were you able
to mic Nippulini?

15:06.339 --> 15:08.541
- Yeah, but if you keep
sending freak shows to me

15:08.575 --> 15:10.477
with metal rods hanging
from their nipples

15:10.510 --> 15:12.279
and all sorts of materials
on their body

15:12.312 --> 15:14.281
and you think that
it's gonna make my life easy--

15:14.314 --> 15:15.415
- Randy!
- Yes?

15:15.448 --> 15:16.549
- Can we hear him?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.385
- Yes, you can hear him.
- Okay.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.653
Oh, my God,
do you mind if I...

15:20.687 --> 15:22.422
- Please.
Just watch the kimono.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.492
- Can I tell you, I haven't
sat down in, like, six months?

15:25.525 --> 15:29.329
I can't take five minutes off
in my life.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.099
- Ener-Jesus, Gaffigan's drink.
Try it.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.034
It's, uh--it'll perk you up,
and it's free.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.303
It's a billion-dollar idea,
trust me.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.504
- It smells like cat piss.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.039
- That's natural.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.111
- Oh, God.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.678
- Yeah.
- Feels weird.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.280
- Yeah, I, um--

15:47.314 --> 15:49.016
- It's like right before
you black out.

15:49.049 --> 15:51.518
- Mm-hmm.
- And my ankles are swollen.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.486
I don't know if I peed,
but I might have.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.188
- Oh, that could be menopause,
though.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.457
- My God, my hair
is falling out.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.192
- Staci, I'm so sorry
to interrupt,

15:59.226 --> 16:00.727
but I've been monitoring
your heart rate,

16:00.760 --> 16:02.762
and it went up
just a little bit.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.164
- I'm fi--
Look, clumps.

16:04.197 --> 16:05.565
I'm fine.
- Are you dying?

16:05.598 --> 16:07.134
- It's rising.
- No, I'm not dying.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.401
- Are you having
a heart attack?

16:08.435 --> 16:10.237
- I don't have an EpiPen
in here.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.471
I had an EpiPen...
- I am not gonna die...

16:11.504 --> 16:13.373
- And I used it
on my dog already.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.075
- In this tepee of feet smell.
- He's allergic to himself.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.210
- That's never gonna happen.
Listen to me, sweetie.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.745
One day, when I take
a lot of pills

16:18.778 --> 16:21.448
in a Four Seasons Hotel
in Scottsdale,

16:21.481 --> 16:22.615
you're gonna be with me.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.618
- Staci,
if I'm not with you

16:25.652 --> 16:27.620
on your deathbed,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.157
then what the hell
is all this for?

16:32.192 --> 16:34.061
- What is wrong with you two?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.663
*

16:36.696 --> 16:38.331
- Wow.

16:42.069 --> 16:44.037
[sighs]

16:44.071 --> 16:45.472
- Are you gonna
introduce yourself

16:45.505 --> 16:47.740
or just go straight in
for the tongue kiss?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.309
- Would you shut up?
He can hear you.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.044
- I will never shut up.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.812
- Hi! Hi.
- Hey.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.347
- Oh, look at that face.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.449
Did you try the crumb cake?

16:56.483 --> 16:58.318
Listen, um,
I just want you to know

16:58.351 --> 17:01.321
that we have a German shepherd
standing by.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.722
- Oh, I--
[stammers]

17:02.755 --> 17:04.457
- Well, look, if they smell
burning rubber,

17:04.491 --> 17:06.426
they'll--they'll bark.
- He can stand down.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.128
'Cause I'm--I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

17:08.161 --> 17:09.396
- Oh, I--you know what?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.264
We have a hose, and--
- [laughing]

17:11.298 --> 17:13.366
A hose?
It doesn't make any difference.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.835
- I know that there's
some security fears, and--

17:15.868 --> 17:18.071
- And I'm not getting shot
out of a cannon.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.739
It's not happening.
- Okay.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.109
- You know, Michael,

17:22.142 --> 17:25.078
there's nothing cooler
than a small, confident man

17:25.112 --> 17:27.580
being shot out of a cannon.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.082
- You know my name?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.084
[dramatic music]

17:31.118 --> 17:32.285
- You get shot
out of a cannon,

17:32.319 --> 17:33.686
everyone's gonna
know your name.

17:33.720 --> 17:40.693
*

17:40.727 --> 17:41.794
- I'll do it.

17:43.863 --> 17:48.535
[energetic brass music]

17:48.568 --> 17:50.470
- Jim Gaffigan.

17:50.503 --> 17:51.804
Listen to me.

17:51.838 --> 17:54.541
There are your Jesus cans
all over the office.

17:54.574 --> 17:57.510
- I can't help it if people
are open to thought

17:57.544 --> 17:59.679
and feelings
and energy drinks.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.614
- Okay, the point is,
if I go out

18:01.648 --> 18:04.684
and I see on the monitor
that you have a Jesus drink

18:04.717 --> 18:07.254
while you're talking to Jimmy
or a logo or anything,

18:07.287 --> 18:08.688
you will never do
this show again.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.423
Write that down.
- Never.

18:10.457 --> 18:11.858
- Fine. [scoffs]
- Okay.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.826
- Look, I won't do anything.

18:13.860 --> 18:16.529
[wheels rumbling]

18:16.563 --> 18:20.567
[dramatic choral music]

18:20.600 --> 18:22.735
- Hey, Jim.

18:22.769 --> 18:25.138
Ener-Jesus is ready
for the show.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.374
- Hey, Jim,

18:27.407 --> 18:28.441
you know,
when I get out there,

18:28.475 --> 18:29.876
I'm gonna say,

18:29.909 --> 18:32.312
"I'm the king of the juice."
[laughing]

18:32.345 --> 18:34.547
- We came up with that together.
- Yeah.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.683
- Okay, I want 5%.
- 3%.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.185
- Fine.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.386
- All right, let's move
some cans.

18:39.419 --> 18:42.389
[uplifting music]

18:42.422 --> 18:49.362
*

19:07.947 --> 19:10.883
[cheers and applause]

19:16.489 --> 19:19.359
- Wow, your heart rate's,
like, perfect.

19:19.392 --> 19:20.760
- It's a great day, Penny.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.495
It's a great show.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.497
And this is how you produce
a late-night talk show.

19:24.531 --> 19:25.965
- Hey, you guys got a sec?
- Yeah, what?

19:25.998 --> 19:28.368
- Uh, Michael J. Fox
is on fire.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.736
- What?

19:29.769 --> 19:31.638
Why didn't you call
the fire marshal?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.973
- Told you--I didn't
know where he is!

19:34.006 --> 19:35.608
Man.
