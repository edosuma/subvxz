WEBVTT

00:05.798 --> 00:08.032
Such a shame.

00:08.032 --> 00:10.401
But I applaud you, Megatron.

00:10.402 --> 00:14.038
You certainly made
a grand exit.

00:15.707 --> 00:18.876
Ah, soundwave.
Cue the audio/visual.

00:18.877 --> 00:21.546
I wish to address the troops.

00:24.516 --> 00:26.551
<i>The loss of Megatron,</i>

00:26.552 --> 00:30.488
<i>leader of the great
Decepticon uprising,</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:34.092
<i>is certainly a blow
to our cause.</i>

00:34.093 --> 00:39.030
<i>Yet we mustn't despair
over his tragic demise</i>

00:39.031 --> 00:44.402
<i>but instead embrace
his ultimate sacrifice</i>

00:44.403 --> 00:48.239
<i>and build upon the foundation
he laid</i>

00:48.240 --> 00:51.876
with an even mightier hand.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.644
With all due respect,

00:53.645 --> 00:57.381
<i>Commander Star--
Uh, lord Starscream.</i>

00:57.382 --> 00:59.650
Yes, yes. What is it?

00:59.651 --> 01:02.720
If we failed to conquer earth
under lord Megatron's command,

01:02.721 --> 01:03.988
what hope do we have now

01:03.989 --> 01:05.957
while the autobots
still defend it?

01:05.958 --> 01:09.994
Allow me to be crystal clear.

01:09.995 --> 01:14.532
I studied for millennia
under our former master.

01:14.533 --> 01:18.402
Thus, I am equipped
to lead you --

01:18.403 --> 01:21.973
I, Megatron's true heir,

01:21.974 --> 01:24.475
lord Starscream,

01:24.476 --> 01:27.712
emperor of destruction!

01:32.584 --> 01:35.319
What?

01:35.320 --> 01:38.389
What use are troops
who can't rise to the task

01:38.390 --> 01:42.593
of inflicting unspeakable
destruction in my name?

01:42.594 --> 01:44.795
Ah, but wait.

01:44.796 --> 01:48.766
Legend tells
of one capable warrior,

01:48.767 --> 01:53.371
one who exists here,
upon this very planet,

01:53.372 --> 01:58.242
one who can be student
to my master.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.203
Optimus, why so glum?

02:50.204 --> 02:52.572
<i>This planet --
all planets --</i>

02:52.573 --> 02:55.708
Are finally free
from Megatron's tyranny.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.144
I do not disagree, Ratchet.

02:58.145 --> 03:00.980
It's just...
A small part of me

03:00.981 --> 03:03.850
hoped to change
Megatron's mind,

03:03.851 --> 03:05.985
not extinguish his spark.

03:05.986 --> 03:10.790
Optimus, his vileness
was not slain by your hand

03:10.791 --> 03:13.226
but by his
own twisted arrogance.

03:13.227 --> 03:15.695
Hmm.
I'm sorry.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.864
I know the two of you
had quite a history.

03:17.865 --> 03:21.667
But the Megatron
whom I once fought beside

03:21.668 --> 03:23.336
perished eons ago,

03:23.337 --> 03:28.274
the day he chose
to become a Cepticon.

03:28.275 --> 03:30.309
The Decepticons may be
in disarray,

03:30.310 --> 03:32.378
but they aren't
without leadership.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.448
And while Starscream
is no Megatron,

03:35.449 --> 03:38.217
he is far from predictable.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.188
Decepticons!
We're under attack!

03:45.559 --> 03:48.094
It's no attack, Ratchet.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.329
It's my volcano.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.766
Or was.

03:53.767 --> 03:57.437
Hold still, bulkhead.
Jupiter needs its red spot.

03:58.705 --> 04:00.006
Whoopsie!

04:00.007 --> 04:03.042
What...ln the allspark

04:03.043 --> 04:05.211
is going on in here?

04:05.212 --> 04:07.013
Our projects are due tomorrow.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.182
Maybe it needs
one of these doohickeys.

04:09.183 --> 04:10.950
You're a motorcycle, Arcee.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.853
Shouldn't you know how
to build a motorcycle engine?

04:13.854 --> 04:15.021
You're a human, Jack.

04:15.022 --> 04:17.023
Can you build me
a small intestine?

04:17.024 --> 04:21.327
Well, you can't work
on these projects in here.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.496
You're...Making a mess.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.365
But the science fair's
a big part of our grade.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.934
Yeah, if bulkhead
doesn't help me

04:27.935 --> 04:29.802
finish this model
of our solar system --

04:31.438 --> 04:34.841
And what does bulkhead know
of your solar system,

04:34.842 --> 04:38.311
or Bumblebee
of your volcanos, or --

04:38.312 --> 04:38.878
Arcee of our motorcycles?

04:38.946 --> 04:39.812
Test

04:39.813 --> 04:41.113
we're not earthlings.

04:43.217 --> 04:45.818
And they're not scientists.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.255
But the autobots are
their guardians, Ratchet.

04:49.256 --> 04:51.157
Would it hurt to learn
more of earth

04:51.158 --> 04:53.726
by helping our young friends
with their schoolwork?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.862
Well, maybe our young friends

04:55.863 --> 04:58.531
should try learning
more of Cybertron.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.299
During the great war,

05:00.300 --> 05:04.137
so much Energon was hidden
on this forsaken rock

05:04.138 --> 05:05.838
that our departed master

05:05.839 --> 05:09.208
sent some of Cybertron's
greatest to guard it --

05:09.209 --> 05:13.346
True warriors
now lying in stasis,

05:13.347 --> 05:16.249
waiting to be reawakened.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.852
Such folly that, late in life,

05:19.853 --> 05:24.690
Megatron searched
distant space for warriors

05:24.691 --> 05:28.060
rather than here,
beneath his feet.

05:29.696 --> 05:33.533
What do you mean you can't
pinpoint his signal?

05:33.534 --> 05:35.234
I know we are close!

05:35.235 --> 05:37.670
Boost the power
to your sensors!

05:39.640 --> 05:43.075
Yes. There.

05:54.254 --> 05:56.455
Really, Bumblebee?

05:56.456 --> 05:58.925
<i>Then how do you make
warrior class?</i>

06:00.861 --> 06:03.829
But I've seen you in action.
You're awesome!

06:03.830 --> 06:07.033
I second your opinion, raf.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.601
But autobots life cycles

06:08.602 --> 06:11.070
are much longer
than those of humans.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.506
And though it may be hard
to believe,

06:13.507 --> 06:16.409
our young scout still has
much to experience.

06:18.045 --> 06:22.381
Exposed Energon,
and it's on the move.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.484
And since we ain't moving it,
guess who must be.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.119
Decepticons.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.888
Without Megatron?

06:28.889 --> 06:32.258
Unfortunately,
Megatron's legacy will live on

06:32.259 --> 06:34.894
as others rise
to take his place.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.730
Autobots, you have
projects to complete.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.434
Ratchet, I may require aid.

06:41.435 --> 06:45.471
Science fair is
a big part of their grade.

06:45.472 --> 06:49.709
Perhaps I'm better suited
to remain behind and advise.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.477
Very well.

06:51.478 --> 06:56.882
Bumblebee, let us see
about this Energon in transit.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.128
Excellent, soundwave.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.863
The cube.

07:20.540 --> 07:24.810
The Energon infusion --
It"s working.

07:36.556 --> 07:38.991
No, Bumblebee, it does not.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.161
Hold your position
and await my command.

07:45.766 --> 07:48.067
Awaken, warrior.

07:48.068 --> 07:52.471
Rise and serve your new master!

07:59.246 --> 08:03.115
Skyquake serves
only one master.

08:03.116 --> 08:04.250
Excellent.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.951
Your loyalty and devotion

08:05.952 --> 08:08.988
will set a fine example
for the troops.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.024
No need to be timid, Skyquake.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.759
You may bow.

08:13.760 --> 08:16.462
You fail to grasp my meaning.

08:16.463 --> 08:19.732
I am here on a mission
assigned to me

08:19.733 --> 08:23.302
by my one master --
Megatron.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.438
Yes. Him.

08:25.439 --> 08:29.041
Sadly, Megatron is
no longer with us.

08:29.042 --> 08:30.676
Impossible.

08:30.677 --> 08:35.081
Why is this so difficult
for everyone to accept?

08:35.082 --> 08:38.583
Skyquake, I located you.

08:38.585 --> 08:40.986
I awakened you.

08:40.986 --> 08:47.026
Thus I, lord Starscream,
am now your master!

08:50.230 --> 08:53.199
It has been a while, Skyquake.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.168
Optimus prime.

08:56.169 --> 09:00.339
I haven't seen you
since the battle of Technar.

09:00.340 --> 09:03.843
Megatron ordered me
to annihilate you.

09:03.844 --> 09:06.145
That was a long time ago.

09:06.146 --> 09:10.850
That may be, prime,
but my orders still stand.

09:10.851 --> 09:14.019
Is this ancient war
still worth fighting

09:14.020 --> 09:18.357
when so many comrades have been
lost and worlds destroyed?

09:18.358 --> 09:21.727
If you want to be a true leader,
Starscream,

09:21.728 --> 09:24.263
then stray from Megatron's path

09:24.264 --> 09:27.233
and lead the Decepticons
toward peace.

09:27.234 --> 09:31.003
I would be willing
to consider a truce...

09:31.004 --> 09:33.439
If you would be willing

09:33.440 --> 09:37.610
to bow before me,
optimus prime.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.578
Again?!
Bow to this!

09:46.753 --> 09:50.623
Skyquake, this is a new era
on another world.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.625
Side with the autobots,

09:52.626 --> 09:55.995
and help me end
this conflict forever.

09:55.996 --> 09:59.999
I will never side with a prime!

10:11.478 --> 10:16.482
What need have I for peace
when I have Skyquake?

10:16.483 --> 10:18.751
With some discipline,

10:18.752 --> 10:22.188
he will learn to respect
his new master.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.890
And once it becomes known

10:24.891 --> 10:29.328
that Skyquake destroyed
optimus prime under my command,

10:29.329 --> 10:35.267
all Decepticons
will gratefully bow to me.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.024
Bumblebee, no!

11:05.139 --> 11:08.475
Do not miss
a single moment, soundwave!

11:08.476 --> 11:11.878
We shall need
visual documentation

11:11.879 --> 11:16.783
of optimus prime's demise
for the historical record.

11:26.927 --> 11:30.196
Skyquake has not yet acquired
a vehicle mode.

11:34.201 --> 11:35.201
Fall back!

11:40.474 --> 11:43.443
So, time has made you
a coward, prime?!

11:45.713 --> 11:47.814
Let's see.
Where is it?

11:47.815 --> 11:50.183
Um...What is it?

11:50.184 --> 11:52.819
You'll find out.

11:52.820 --> 11:56.523
But, Ratchet, shouldn't I
be doing the work?

11:56.524 --> 11:57.891
Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't touch!

11:57.892 --> 12:01.427
Just watch and learn.

12:01.428 --> 12:05.265
So, we're just gonna go help
Jack and Miko finish their --

12:05.266 --> 12:07.167
Without my supervision?!

12:07.168 --> 12:10.203
You want them to be right,
don't you?

12:12.640 --> 12:16.876
Then watch a master at work!

12:16.877 --> 12:20.313
Control freak.

12:22.583 --> 12:25.118
We've lost sight of them.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.754
Soundwave, why aren't you
tracking them?

12:27.755 --> 12:29.789
What? What is it?

12:33.561 --> 12:36.229
A second
Decepticon life signal?

12:36.230 --> 12:40.266
But Skyquake is the only sleeper
buried in this area.

12:40.267 --> 12:45.738
The site of our destroyed
space bridge.

12:45.739 --> 12:48.541
You're not telling me
that life signal

12:48.542 --> 12:53.079
belongs...To Megatron?

12:53.080 --> 12:56.449
B-b-but he was microns
from the detonation point!

12:56.450 --> 12:59.152
Nothing could have survived
that blast!

12:59.153 --> 13:01.487
Your sensors must be faulty!

13:01.488 --> 13:04.757
Ignore the contact!
Delete the coordinates!

13:06.727 --> 13:08.895
Oh, what am I saying?

13:08.896 --> 13:12.832
O-of course this
Must be investigated.

13:12.833 --> 13:17.971
If lord Megatron is up there,
I shall bring him home.

13:19.440 --> 13:22.375
Remain here
and monitor the outcome.

13:22.376 --> 13:25.078
When Skyquake snuffs
prime's spark,

13:25.079 --> 13:29.215
I must bear witness.

13:36.891 --> 13:39.259
<i>Must bear witness.</i>

13:46.467 --> 13:48.968
<i>Tango 6 Alpha
to central command.</i>

13:48.969 --> 13:50.703
<i>We're picking up transmissions</i>

13:50.704 --> 13:54.908
<i>originating from unidentified
technology, possibly hostile.</i>

13:54.909 --> 13:56.276
<i>We are moving to investigate.</i>

13:56.277 --> 13:57.944
Negative, tango 6 Alpha.

13:57.945 --> 14:00.747
This is special agent
William Fowler intercepting.

14:00.748 --> 14:02.782
Strike your report
from the records

14:02.783 --> 14:04.684
and provide origin coordinates.

14:04.685 --> 14:06.119
I'll take it from here.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.869
It will be a shame
to crush you, bug,

14:22.870 --> 14:25.905
but it is my duty.

14:35.516 --> 14:38.651
Excellent strategy, Bumblebee.

14:45.025 --> 14:49.195
Skyquake, stay down.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.836
Fowler?

15:03.310 --> 15:05.445
Agent Fowler, fall back!

15:21.161 --> 15:23.496
Well, I'll be a bald eagle.

15:25.232 --> 15:28.334
Air superiority achieved.

15:58.354 --> 16:01.256
Stealing plans for
a classified military aircraft

16:01.257 --> 16:03.791
will not be tolerated
on my watch!

16:14.870 --> 16:16.271
Heat seekers!

16:22.945 --> 16:25.079
I still got it.

16:34.089 --> 16:37.492
No one could have
survived this.

16:38.727 --> 16:41.629
As I suspected --
Faulty sensors.

16:41.630 --> 16:43.731
The last thing I need now

16:43.732 --> 16:45.900
are rumors that Megatron
is still --

16:55.811 --> 16:57.812
Megatron.

16:57.813 --> 16:58.947
Die!

17:02.351 --> 17:04.819
But how?

17:08.057 --> 17:11.259
Ah, dark Energon.

17:11.260 --> 17:15.896
Everyone believes
you are deceased.

17:15.897 --> 17:21.736
Who am I to disappoint
them...Master?

17:31.213 --> 17:34.382
And this time, stay dead!

17:40.289 --> 17:43.391
Soundwave,
if you are listening,

17:43.392 --> 17:49.163
I have found lord Megatron,
and he is...Unwell.

17:49.164 --> 17:54.202
We must transport him
to sickbay immediately.

18:38.447 --> 18:42.216
Agent Fowler,
we require immediate assistance.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.603
Any time, fella.

19:02.604 --> 19:04.605
Ground floor's coming fast.

19:24.426 --> 19:26.761
Happy landings, 'con.

19:39.308 --> 19:43.578
Had Skyquake chosen to stray
from his master's path,

19:43.579 --> 19:46.614
we might not be
burying him today.

19:53.689 --> 19:56.624
Bumblebee,
putting yourself at risk

19:56.625 --> 19:59.961
was perhaps not the wisest
of strategies,

19:59.962 --> 20:02.997
but you performed admirably.

20:06.635 --> 20:09.403
Aha-ha-ha!
There you are.

20:14.076 --> 20:15.343
Well?

20:15.344 --> 20:19.046
<i>How were my -- Uh,
our projects received?</i>

20:19.047 --> 20:21.282
Well...

20:21.283 --> 20:24.886
Miss Nakadai,
what planet would that be?

20:24.887 --> 20:27.955
Um...Cybertron?

20:29.057 --> 20:34.362
It's...Large, Mr. Darby,
but is it operational?

20:34.363 --> 20:35.630
Whoa, whoa!

20:41.203 --> 20:44.438
I hesitate to ask,
Mr. Esquivel,

20:44.439 --> 20:49.377
but, uh, is it active?

20:51.146 --> 20:53.848
Well, on our planet,

20:53.849 --> 20:55.983
you would have been awarded
the highest honors.

20:55.984 --> 20:59.353
Absolutely no gratitude.
See if I help them.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.358
Indeed, Bumblebee.

21:04.359 --> 21:06.961
Our human friends
would have been wise

21:06.962 --> 21:09.063
to stray from Ratchet's path.

21:10.966 --> 21:15.269
The troops will be pleased
to hear of our success

21:15.270 --> 21:18.673
in rushing lord Megatron
into stasis.

21:18.674 --> 21:22.944
Let us hope that our master
pulls through.
