WEBVTT

00:17.809 --> 00:20.186
To be honest,
her grades aren't great.

00:20.270 --> 00:23.106
-Hmm.
-But Erin is a very special young lady,

00:23.189 --> 00:27.402
and I think that if she could keep
a top GPA at a community college,

00:27.485 --> 00:30.405
that would be enough to get her into
CU Denver in a couple of years.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.073
Hey! Go Buffaloes.

00:32.157 --> 00:35.368
<i>University of Colorado</i>
<i>would be lucky to have our daughter.</i>

00:35.452 --> 00:37.871
<i>How about Brown? I'm a legacy.</i>

00:37.954 --> 00:40.665
Maybe I could get her
an internship at Space Force.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.000
That might help out, right?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.001
Oh.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.795
<i>Mark, maybe we should pay a coach</i>
<i>to put her on the soccer team.</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:49.132
No, no, no, no. People tried to do that,
and they went to jail.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.594
<i>Like I care. 'Cause that extra three weeks</i>
<i>would be insufferable.</i>

00:52.677 --> 00:54.179
My mom is in prison.

00:54.262 --> 00:56.014
-I know.
-We don't need to talk about that.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.475
Mrs. Naird,
I'm very impressed that, as a convict,

00:58.558 --> 01:00.393
you want a better life for your daughter.

01:00.477 --> 01:04.647
How about a trade school?
Concrete pouring is very hot these days.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.400
<i>Oh, you know, Louise was a cement mason.</i>

01:07.484 --> 01:08.943
<i>Very strong union.</i>

01:09.027 --> 01:10.612
Louise is my mom's lover.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.197
-All right.
She's also her guard.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.240
We don't need to talk about that.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.618
Cement mason.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.620
I guess I've heard worse ideas.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.373
How do you feel about that?
You like cement? That interest you?

01:27.754 --> 01:32.592
<i>Naird, regarding this upcoming visit with</i>
<i>the Chinese space agency to Wild Horse,</i>

01:32.675 --> 01:35.011
<i>the President wants you</i>
<i>to strike a treaty with the Chinese</i>

01:35.095 --> 01:37.597
<i>to ensure that</i>
<i>we share resources on the moon.</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:40.350
<i>The space race is the new cold war.</i>

01:40.433 --> 01:43.269
<i>The whole world is watching</i>
<i>to see if we deserve to lead it.</i>

01:43.353 --> 01:46.147
We will crush them, sir.
We've got this in the bag.

01:46.231 --> 01:49.234
<i>But it's important</i>
<i>that you show tact and civility.</i>

01:49.317 --> 01:51.820
<i>We don't wanna come off</i>
<i>like a bunch of cowboys.</i>

01:51.903 --> 01:53.613
-1995 Super Bowl champs.
All right.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.573
<i>See, that's exactly</i>
<i>what I'm talking about.</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:57.325
<i>This whole "yahoo" mentality.</i>

01:57.408 --> 02:00.912
<i>And also, the Cowboys title was in 1996.</i>

02:01.996 --> 02:03.748
Well, don't I have egg on my face?

02:03.832 --> 02:04.666
Huh?

02:04.749 --> 02:07.418
Brad, you actually do
have egg on your face.

02:07.502 --> 02:10.213
I didn't have eggs for breakfast.
Huh. Probably a story there.

02:10.296 --> 02:13.258
Okay, we just got a list of
the Chinese delegates that are attending,

02:13.341 --> 02:15.552
and there are
some heavy hitters on this list.

02:15.635 --> 02:19.430
Highly decorated General Gao.
Got the head of science, Dr. Zhang.

02:19.514 --> 02:20.557
Dr. Zhang?

02:20.640 --> 02:25.520
The same Dr. Zhang who called me a duck
and is a moon-landing denier?

02:25.603 --> 02:27.981
Dr. Mallory, remember, diplomacy.

02:28.064 --> 02:28.982
Oh, don't worry.

02:29.065 --> 02:31.568
I'll show the ant-brained dunce
a great time.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.195
Also, the lead astronaut
from the moon mission, Dr. Lim.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.738
Ooh. Dr. Lim is coming?

02:35.822 --> 02:36.739
Yeah, Dr. Lim.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.158
Yes. Oh, he's the best.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.618
He's the only person
to ever beat me in Uno. On the moon.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.912
Yeah, he's very talented and smart.
He's a great guy.

02:42.996 --> 02:47.333
I think we should honor our guests
with an authentic Chinese banquet.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.545
-Yes! That's a great idea.
-I have the Panda Express on speed dial.

02:50.628 --> 02:51.629
Good luck with that.

02:51.713 --> 02:55.633
Even the Panda Express here closed down
because locals found the food too "spicy."

02:55.717 --> 02:59.053
You know, Mr. Chu in San Francisco
is an old friend of mine.

02:59.137 --> 03:03.016
<i>The</i> Chus? Like, the top Michelin
Chinese restaurant in all of California?

03:03.099 --> 03:05.393
We actually used to date, uh,

03:05.476 --> 03:08.605
but then he took
the braised abalone off the menu,

03:08.688 --> 03:09.772
and I took the hint.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.318
You know what, sir? I could
actually teach you Chinese etiquette.

03:13.401 --> 03:15.904
I spent some time
over at Guangzhou for my term abroad.

03:15.987 --> 03:19.115
I'm sorry, but there's no way you studied
abroad and are still the way you are.

03:21.993 --> 03:22.994
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

03:23.077 --> 03:24.078
Ah!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.914
And, uh, I can play the erhu, General.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.207
-What?
-What?

03:27.290 --> 03:28.541
What's the erhu?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.418
-A classic Chinese instrument.
-Yeah.

03:30.501 --> 03:32.212
It's basically our version of the violin.

03:32.295 --> 03:35.423
Or, should I say, the violin
is the bastardized Western version

03:35.506 --> 03:36.674
of our erhu.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.800
Uh-oh!

03:37.884 --> 03:40.470
It's gorgeous. It's got two strings.
It's made out of python skin.

03:40.553 --> 03:45.516
Wow! You all seem to know
a shitload about Chinese culture.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.852
-Well, I'm Chinese.
-All right. I have to cram.

03:47.936 --> 03:50.104
Don't worry. I am a quick study.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.690
At the age of three, I learned how
to tie my shoe in 15 minutes.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.025
Oh, I love that story.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.489
Wait. Is it the left one for dessert
and the right one for dinner?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.157
Yes.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.325
I knew it.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.373
-They're probably gonna give you a gift.
-Yes.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.751
You wanna make sure you
use both hands to receive and give gifts.

04:11.834 --> 04:14.212
-Okay.
-And then you wanna take a little bow.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.631
-But not too much.
-That's way too much.

04:16.714 --> 04:18.549
-Okay.
-You're out of control.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.135
Yeah, past 45 degrees, you look…
Okay. Like--

04:21.219 --> 04:23.513
-I look…
-You look Japanese.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.514
Is that bad?

04:25.014 --> 04:26.474
-Well, just…
-It's different.

04:26.557 --> 04:27.558
-Confusing.
-Yeah.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.560
-Yeah.
-Okay, so a small bow.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.812
There it is.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.689
-Ooh!
-Oh no. You look like Quasimodo.

04:32.772 --> 04:35.400
Hey, he was a good guy. Got a raw deal.

04:35.483 --> 04:37.652
-Yeah.
-Okay, follow me.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.821
Set up this little tea thing for you.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.489
-Forever learning. Forever learning.
-Yes.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.908
When someone is pouring you tea,

04:43.992 --> 04:46.411
you wanna lightly tap the table
with two fingers.

04:46.494 --> 04:47.745
It's a sign of respect.

04:47.829 --> 04:48.746
-That's great.
-Ah!

04:48.830 --> 04:50.665
In America, when you tap the table,

04:50.748 --> 04:53.626
it's a sign you want the blackjack dealer
to give you another card.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.544
Yes, Brad.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.255
Every Chinese person's
been to Vegas. It's our Mecca.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.342
Oh, well, except for the Muslim Chinese.
'Cause Mecca is their Mecca.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.595
Okay, the key thing to remember

05:04.679 --> 05:06.514
-is family's extremely important.
-That's right.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.683
Every Chinese parent
loves to brag about their kids.

05:08.766 --> 05:11.060
-You should bring Erin.
-I don't know if that's a good idea.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.438
-It's a fantastic idea.
-Yes. They would love her!

05:13.521 --> 05:15.481
I'm not sure
she would even be able to come.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.442
I could DM her right now and find out.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.402
Mmm. How important is this?

05:21.070 --> 05:22.822
It's, like, the most important.

05:22.905 --> 05:27.118
You know, the Chinese
have a tremendous respect

05:27.201 --> 05:28.786
for elder statesmen.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.623
We should invite
one of the original Apollo astronauts.

05:32.707 --> 05:36.627
Give Dr. Zhang
a piece of real American space history.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.254
-Yes.
-That's a great idea.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.340
-It is!
-Let's try and get Lance Armstrong.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.676
Yes. Call Lance Armstrong, Brad.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.053
I will do that right now.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.013
Should talk about
how you're gonna drink the tea.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.765
-You don't gulp. You sip.
-Wait, wait, wait.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.683
Think he's actually
gonna call Lance Armstrong?

05:50.767 --> 05:52.101
-Hello.
-Hey, Brad?

05:52.185 --> 05:54.020
-Yeah?
-Who you talkin' to, bud?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.733
Erin, I want you
on your best behavior today.

05:59.233 --> 06:02.403
I promise I won't start an international
incident like you almost did.

06:02.487 --> 06:03.404
Don't be fresh.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.989
I want you to smile, to be polite.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.866
And if your mother comes up,

06:06.949 --> 06:09.744
just say that she is
taking some time for herself.

06:09.827 --> 06:12.872
Yes. 20 to 30 years for herself.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.876
What the fuck are they wearing?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.797
General Gao, welcome to Space Force.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.758
General Naird, howdy.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.760
This is my wife, Siu.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.512
-Howdy.
-And my son, Jing.

06:27.595 --> 06:28.429
Howdy.

06:28.513 --> 06:31.933
It is a pleasure to meet you
and your lovely family.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.976
This is my daughter, Erin.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.229
She's painfully shy.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.315
And she hardly ever says anything.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.358
'Sup?

06:40.441 --> 06:43.069
What a stunning young lady.
You must be proud.

06:43.152 --> 06:43.986
Thank you.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.698
And your son, he is also stunning.

06:49.951 --> 06:53.413
He skipped two grades.
That is what we are most proud of.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.666
Mm. I, too, have skipped a few classes.

06:56.749 --> 06:57.667
Hmm.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.670
A gift from us. Moutai.

07:00.753 --> 07:01.629
Ah.

07:01.712 --> 07:03.548
My country's favorite liquor.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.927
Very gracious of you, General.
We have a gift for you as well.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.639
American cigars
from the great state of Connecticut.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.310
Perhaps the second-
or third-best cigar in the world.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.856
I was thinking that maybe later you and I
could fire up a couple of those bad boys

07:19.939 --> 07:22.775
and discuss the division
of lunar resources.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.154
Perhaps. Later.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.408
Sir, slow down.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.619
In China, they never
discuss business right away.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.247
Copy that. Slow and steady wins the moon.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.211
-Ah. General, may I?
-Oh, yes, Captain. Yes.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.130
Hey.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.674
-Wow. Dr. Lim.
-Hey.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.885
Dr. Lim is a smoke show.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.263
I know. If I were Angela,
I would choose him over me too.

07:52.346 --> 07:54.140
What? Stop that.

07:54.223 --> 07:57.643
I would have sex with you over him
any day of the week.

07:57.727 --> 07:58.644
-Really?
-Yes.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.938
I would ride you
like a three-legged camel.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.356
Aw, that's very sweet of you.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.525
Of course. So, what?
What are you afraid of?

08:04.609 --> 08:05.735
That they did it on the moon?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.571
No. I mean, he is,
like, super good-looking.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.073
-Very good-looking.
-And they're both astronauts.

08:11.157 --> 08:14.535
One could be having
a zero-gravity alcohol swab bath.

08:14.619 --> 08:17.205
-The other one floats in accidentally…
-Okay.

08:17.288 --> 08:18.289
…and then they touch,

08:18.372 --> 08:21.000
and then her knee grazes
the side of his perfect cheekbones.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.211
-They have an intimate moment together.
-Super specific.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.463
They lock eyes,
and her face is flushed red.

08:25.546 --> 08:27.298
Okay, you gotta stop. You gotta stop.

08:27.381 --> 08:29.175
Been thinking about it
way too much, all right?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.761
You need to find out for sure.
You gotta confront this guy.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.013
You should meet him
outside the bathroom.

08:34.680 --> 08:36.182
That's very creepy.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.642
It is not. Think about it.

08:37.725 --> 08:40.269
Everybody has to go.
There's only one way in or out.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.148
You're not making it less creepy.

08:49.111 --> 08:50.613
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

08:50.696 --> 08:51.697
Dr. Mallory.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.992
Oh, well, at least this year,
we've gotten each other's name right.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.285
That's a big step.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.121
Some might even say a giant leap.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.373
Sure, sure.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.709
Well, I have a gift for you, sir.

09:03.793 --> 09:08.798
This is an art piece made by my fiancé.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.511
She's very talented.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.305
Actually, it's a he. Jerome.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.558
His pronouns are he/him.

09:18.641 --> 09:21.477
Oh, I see. Congratulations.

09:21.978 --> 09:25.273
You two make
for a very accomplished couple.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.525
Does it bother you that we're a couple?

09:28.234 --> 09:30.069
No. I said "congratulations."

09:30.945 --> 09:34.323
I see. Well, thank you. We're very happy.

09:34.865 --> 09:35.825
Pardon?

09:35.908 --> 09:38.619
What? I didn't say anything.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.288
Hey, it's cool.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.039
He's cool.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.749
Yeah. We're good.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.836
Dr. Zhang,
perhaps you'll have one of these someday.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.589
This is our Space Hall of Heroes.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.635
Armstrong, Aldrin,
the first two men on the moon.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.513
Twelve American astronauts
had set foot on the moon<i>…</i>

09:57.597 --> 09:58.723
Hollywood star.

09:58.806 --> 10:01.100
…by 1972.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.145
Is that Bruce Willis?

10:04.729 --> 10:05.938
Very good actor.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.064
He is a good actor.

10:07.148 --> 10:09.942
That astronaut has
a full head of hair though.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.236
Wig.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.745
So, General, how was your flight?

10:21.287 --> 10:22.872
It was long.

10:23.831 --> 10:24.874
I slept.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.834
Ah. Sleep is good.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.294
I like sleep.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.088
Ask him about Fan Bingbing.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.299
-Who is that?
-It's a famous Chinese actress.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.426
Fan Bingbing.
He'll go crazy. Fan Bingbing.

10:36.218 --> 10:38.846
So, how about that Fan Bingbing?

10:38.929 --> 10:40.514
She's quite the actress.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.850
She committed tax fraud.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.937
Our government does not condone
that kind of behavior.

10:47.021 --> 10:50.274
Oh, that's right.
Fan Bingbing Wesley-Sniped in China.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.942
That was a huge mistake by me.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.653
-Well…
-That's my bad.

10:53.736 --> 10:56.864
Fan Bingbing must have been
drinking too much Moutai

10:56.947 --> 10:58.240
when she did her taxes.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.121
-Wanna watch a funny video?
-Sure.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.207
Tom Brady.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.500
Tom Brady.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.959
-Oh, come on.
-Oh, yes. Yes.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.628
Very good football player.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.297
Yes, he is. He is a living legend.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.216
You like football?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.385
I don't understand it.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.302
Ah.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.221
It's very confusing.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.392
Your daughter is very charming.

11:31.148 --> 11:32.066
Hmm.

11:32.983 --> 11:35.611
Oh my God. I am so excited you're here.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.114
Feel like I've been going out of my mind
with nobody to talk to

11:38.197 --> 11:40.116
about what happened up there.

11:40.199 --> 11:41.867
It's kind of wild being back, huh?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.496
They threw a parade for us
in six different cities.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.540
-We're national heroes.
-Ugh.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.458
Doesn't it feel so fake though?

11:50.334 --> 11:54.130
I mean, 'cause you and I both know
what went down was not exactly ideal.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.718
We… We witnessed horrible, private things.

12:00.010 --> 12:03.305
A man ate a bird.
We drank each other's urine.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.475
But now we drink mimosas.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.102
Sure. Um…

12:08.602 --> 12:11.897
But, I mean, you just, like,
cry randomly at night sometimes, right?

12:11.981 --> 12:12.857
-No.
-No?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.109
No. Actually, that's very sad.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.862
You should talk to somebody about that.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.196
Yeah, probably.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.906
But what about all the, like, lies?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.325
Like selling our governments'
bullshit propaganda?

12:23.409 --> 12:24.577
Propaganda?

12:24.660 --> 12:27.455
Hey, Dr. Lim. What's up?

12:27.538 --> 12:30.416
We were on the moon with you, bro.
Remember us?

12:32.585 --> 12:33.627
No.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.714
Excuse me.

12:37.256 --> 12:39.258
You should enjoy the celebration.

12:39.341 --> 12:40.968
It's quite the special occasion.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.429
Will do. Can't beat an open bar.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.357
'Sup?

12:56.734 --> 12:57.693
After you.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.330
This looks wonderful.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.626
We certainly weren't expecting
authentic Chinese food in Wild Horse.

13:13.709 --> 13:16.504
Well, I guess we're not all cowboys, huh?

13:20.883 --> 13:21.842
After you.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.177
Ah…

13:34.021 --> 13:38.234
Oh, come on. It's very delicate tofu.

13:40.069 --> 13:41.737
Just use your… Just use a fork.

13:41.821 --> 13:44.240
I might as well
just burn a cross on his lawn.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.743
-I'll pick up the bottom.
-No, I got it. I got it. I got it.

13:49.370 --> 13:50.996
I'll help you out. Just get down…

13:51.080 --> 13:52.832
-Oh…
-Gingerly, gingerly, gingerly…

13:54.166 --> 13:56.168
-I got it.

13:58.295 --> 13:59.296
Oh, f…

14:06.136 --> 14:08.639
Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't. Don't.

14:08.722 --> 14:09.557
Mm!

14:10.766 --> 14:11.892
Delicious.

14:17.898 --> 14:18.983
How did that go?

14:19.066 --> 14:20.317
-Super nice guy.
-Great.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.654
High-level astrophysicist.
He's an Olympic triathlete.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.448
Even gave me his WeChat contact
so he can hang out with me in Beijing.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.325
-You know what he's doing, right?
-What?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.870
He's gassing you up so you'll
let your guard down, then, "Ffft!"

14:30.953 --> 14:33.163
He's gonna steal your girl.
It's a classic move.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.875
So you really think he's into Angela?

14:35.958 --> 14:39.461
There's, like, a thousand memes of her.
She's "Drummer Moon Girl," dude.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.841
Thank you, General Gregory.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.927
That's what I call music.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.391
I would like to propose a toast
to our esteemed guests.

14:52.474 --> 14:56.854
May our friendship
be as great as your wall.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.523
Neighbors on Earth.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.193
Oh. All right.

15:08.657 --> 15:14.955
And to the scientists
and astronauts of both of our countries

15:15.039 --> 15:19.376
as they explore space
and see what's out there together.

15:21.253 --> 15:25.799
And I would like to welcome
our guest of honor this evening.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.677
-A true pioneer.

15:28.761 --> 15:32.598
One of the original 12 heroic Americans

15:32.681 --> 15:34.475
who walked on the moon,

15:34.558 --> 15:36.685
a warm welcome to Gus Kelly.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.686
Cheers.

15:45.861 --> 15:48.072
Very good performance on the moon.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.240
Very believable.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.577
He's a real astronaut, you imbecile.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.037
-Adrian…

15:56.330 --> 15:58.248
-Ow.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.543
I have a toast.

16:02.753 --> 16:07.091
To a local celebrity
and his acting talent.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.008
Shao Jun.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.135
Haven't I seen him in the movies?

16:10.219 --> 16:12.304
Maybe <i>Independence Day</i>?

16:12.388 --> 16:15.015
Oh, the <i>Space Jam</i> with Michael Jordan.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.353
I put my boots on the moon,

16:19.436 --> 16:23.649
and I'll put my boot up your ass
if you don't shut up.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.275
Well put, Commander.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.362
Maybe you should bring
your stunt double for that.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.655
-Yeah.

16:32.616 --> 16:35.786
Shit. All righty. Hold on. Adrian. Adrian.

16:36.370 --> 16:37.246
Stop it!

16:37.329 --> 16:38.414
He started it.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.456
Time to go.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.583
-All right. Okay.
-Come on.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.128
You don't have to leave.
We have dessert coming. No?

16:44.211 --> 16:45.337
Yep. Red bean cake.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.674
General Gao. Uh…

16:51.427 --> 16:54.471
-General Naird. That was--

16:54.555 --> 16:57.433
What is the football term? A fumble.

16:57.516 --> 16:59.309
My sincere apologies, General.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.396
You know how headstrong
these scientists can be.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.689
I do.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.316
Dr. Zhang is a constant nag in my ear.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.610
And mine is a pain in the ass.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.820
Can't live with them

17:09.903 --> 17:12.197
-but you can't shoot them.
-Can't shoot them.

17:14.408 --> 17:17.453
I still have time for a drink.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.163
If you want,

17:19.955 --> 17:22.666
maybe we can share a bottle of Moutai.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.044
It would be my pleasure.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.258
-No way he can handle the Moutai.
-Mm.

17:31.341 --> 17:33.969
After three drinks,
we get whatever we want.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.848
Chinese people
love to do business over drinks,

17:37.931 --> 17:40.726
but you gotta handle your alcohol so
you don't get the short end of the deal.

17:40.809 --> 17:41.727
I'll be fine.

17:41.810 --> 17:45.272
No, Moutai's a totally different beast.
One time, I drank half a bottle…

17:45.355 --> 17:48.192
I ended up in a quinceañera
dressed as Abraham Lincoln.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.986
General, to be safe, you should
coat your tongue with cod liver oil.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.906
-Isn't that from <i>I Love Lucy</i>?
-That's where I saw it. Huh, great minds.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.783
No. You just chug a bottle of Pedialyte.

17:55.866 --> 17:57.076
How would you know about that?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.577
Know how you fix your phone in rice?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.454
Eat rice. Your stomach becomes the phone.

18:00.537 --> 18:04.875
Maybe a teaspoon of yeast in some yogurt.
That'll break down the enzymes.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.461
I should probably call an ambulance now,
get it out of the way.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.589
I don't need any of that. I know how
to hold my liquor. Everybody out.

18:10.672 --> 18:12.007
-Brad, Erin?
-Yeah.

18:12.716 --> 18:14.885
Brad, we have
known each other a long time.

18:14.968 --> 18:16.470
-You know when I've hit my limit.
-Yes.

18:16.553 --> 18:18.639
When that time comes,
give Erin the signal.

18:18.722 --> 18:19.640
Yes, General.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.016
Okay. We've got you, Dad.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.102
We're gonna talk about
the Pedialyte later.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.486
<i>Gānbēi.</i>

18:35.697 --> 18:37.908
-Mmm. Very smooth.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.827
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.913
-Another?
-Why not?

18:51.171 --> 18:55.759
We came here to make a deal, General,
so I will make it simple from my end.

18:55.843 --> 19:00.305
60/40 split on the Sea of Tranquility,
but we keep the H2.

19:00.389 --> 19:03.892
70/30 for us, and we split the H2 50/50.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.061
60/40, you can have 20% of H2.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.105
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not gonna work.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.024
We are not going to take
the short end of this deal, General.

19:12.401 --> 19:14.194
I'm not sure if you're aware of it or not,

19:14.278 --> 19:17.197
but the United States
has the highest GDP in the world.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.075
Not for long.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.673
Hello.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.841
-Hey.
-Hi.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.012
So, uh, Dr. Lim, huh?

19:40.846 --> 19:43.891
Yeah. He's, uh, nice.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.350
Good-looking guy too.

19:45.934 --> 19:46.768
Oh, is he?

19:46.852 --> 19:51.940
I guess. I mean, if you're into, uh,
tall astrophysicists, you know.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.736
I mean, some women prefer shorter men
who haven't been on the moon.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.780
You know, I'm not into Dr. Lim.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.240
-So…
-Mm!

20:00.324 --> 20:03.410
Yeah, no, we're, um, you know, friends.

20:03.493 --> 20:04.411
At best.

20:05.120 --> 20:07.497
Why do guys always think
a woman has to be, like, with a dude?

20:07.581 --> 20:10.292
-You see a guy, "Are you with him?"
-No. That's not what I'm saying.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.128
I'm just making an observation
because I'm a scientis…

20:13.212 --> 20:14.129
I'm leaving.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.047
…t.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.802
She put him in the friend zone.

20:23.972 --> 20:24.806
Mm.

20:26.183 --> 20:29.436
70/30 on H2. Final offer.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.818
General, how old is your son?

20:37.611 --> 20:38.612
Jing?

20:40.155 --> 20:41.531
He just turned ten.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.033
Ten.

20:43.116 --> 20:48.080
I remember when Erin was ten.
She was such a little peach.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.875
Your daughter is lovely, General.
You're a lucky man.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.460
Yeah, she's a good kid.

20:53.543 --> 20:57.297
She just hasn't been her best recently.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.924
It's probably my fault.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.510
The job, you know. Moving around so much.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.553
Don't blame yourself, General.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.225
Your work is important to your country.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.851
Well, I hope you're right.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.982
You know as well as anybody
that it's hard to serve your country

21:15.065 --> 21:16.233
and be a good dad.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.236
My son once said to me,

21:20.070 --> 21:22.948
"Just because you are the general at work

21:23.031 --> 21:25.117
doesn't make you the general at home."

21:26.827 --> 21:30.080
Erin said the exact same thing to me
when she was in sixth grade.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.290
The little shit.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.717
General, what do you say
we put our differences aside

21:41.800 --> 21:45.178
and just split this damn thing
down the middle? 50/50.

21:45.762 --> 21:49.349
For the next generation.
For Jing, for Erin.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.195
-Oh! They're standing.
-I can see that.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.074
General, has anyone ever told you

22:06.158 --> 22:09.828
that you have beautiful eyes?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.207
Mayday! Mayday!
Extract the asset.

22:14.291 --> 22:15.417
Okay. Okay.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.545
Okay.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.631
-We did it. We did it, honey.
-Yeah? All right.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.009
-Brad, you magnificent bastard.
-Thank you, sir.

22:24.092 --> 22:26.219
Oh! General Gao's such a nice guy.

22:26.303 --> 22:27.596
-Cucumbers.
-No, no, no.
