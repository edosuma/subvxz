MADRID, NOVEMBER, 1934

00:51.293 --> 00:57.293
THE CHESS PLAYER

01:50.084 --> 01:52.959
BASED ON THE NOVEL "THE CHESS PLAYER"
WRITTEN AND ADAPTED BY JULIO CASTEDO

02:18.668 --> 02:19.709
Excuse me.

02:19.876 --> 02:22.376
Which one is
the reigning champion?

02:22.543 --> 02:24.626
You haven't
done your homework.

02:27.209 --> 02:29.918
You're about to
witness a historic moment.

02:31.501 --> 02:32.459
Yes, -

02:32.626 --> 02:33.626
of course.

02:35.376 --> 02:37.084
Moreno, the champion...

02:37.501 --> 02:39.834
is the one who looks like
he just sentenced the match.

02:41.709 --> 02:42.876
He's playing white.

02:43.043 --> 02:45.251
He only needs a
draw to keep the title.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.626
It looks like he has the
nerdy-looking one cornered.

02:51.793 --> 02:53.001
The challenger.

02:54.001 --> 02:55.168
Diego Padilla.

02:55.418 --> 02:56.293
Shit!

02:56.709 --> 02:58.668
Then I'm not in the right place.

02:59.001 --> 03:00.793
I'm on the loser's side.

03:00.959 --> 03:02.793
That's what everyone thinks.

03:10.834 --> 03:13.584
Padilla knows that
Moreno only needs a draw.

03:14.043 --> 03:16.334
But he also knows
that the reigning champ

03:16.501 --> 03:18.084
can't resist a victory.

03:23.251 --> 03:25.459
And that his ambition
will also be his grave.

03:41.251 --> 03:43.334
That's bad for the nerd.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.834
Sometimes you
have to make sacrifices.

03:48.459 --> 03:50.126
Padilla's going to win?

04:04.043 --> 04:05.751
Mate in six moves.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.709
Let's make a toast.

05:35.876 --> 05:37.334
Thank you. Here.

05:37.668 --> 05:38.501
To the champ.

05:46.376 --> 05:48.043
Where are you from, Marianne?

05:48.584 --> 05:51.293
I thought he was the
one being interviewed.

05:51.459 --> 05:52.959
Diego's the best
player in the world.

05:53.168 --> 05:54.376
A genius.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.043
That's all you need to know.

05:57.334 --> 05:57.959
Pads?

06:02.459 --> 06:04.668
What do you think of the
current situation in your country?

06:04.834 --> 06:06.293
I'm not a politician.

06:06.668 --> 06:08.459
Nor do politicians interest me.

06:09.001 --> 06:11.293
But you must have an
opinion about what's happening.

06:11.626 --> 06:13.543
The miners in
Asturias, Catalonia...

06:14.209 --> 06:16.209
I'm only a chess player.

06:16.876 --> 06:17.918
Sorry to disappoint you.

06:29.668 --> 06:33.043
Apolitical people like you
are very useful to the conservatives.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.876
You help them reach power.

06:37.209 --> 06:41.126
If you're trying to
awaken my political conscience,

06:41.584 --> 06:42.918
you won't succeed.

06:43.501 --> 06:44.876
Let's get another round.

06:46.209 --> 06:47.043
Come on.

06:51.251 --> 06:53.001
Two daiquiris.
- Yes, sir.

06:57.459 --> 06:59.209
You're going to scare her off.

06:59.918 --> 07:01.084
Don't worry, I'm leaving.

07:01.251 --> 07:02.751
No, I'm leaving.

07:03.709 --> 07:04.626
You?

07:04.876 --> 07:06.418
You don't like Marianne?

07:06.584 --> 07:07.626
And you don't?

07:08.001 --> 07:10.251
Of course, why wouldn't I?

07:11.876 --> 07:13.918
But I fall in love every week.

07:14.084 --> 07:15.334
And she's interested in you.

07:17.584 --> 07:18.751
That's impossible.

07:18.918 --> 07:21.418
Stop pretending you're
more boring than you are.

07:21.584 --> 07:23.251
Go on, tell her something...

07:23.418 --> 07:25.043
that sounds interesting.

07:26.751 --> 07:28.834
Some day you
might even thank me.

07:44.834 --> 07:45.918
And Javier?

07:46.626 --> 07:48.043
He had to leave.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.709
He's a very busy man.

07:54.334 --> 07:56.418
Why did you
come to work in Spain?

07:56.834 --> 07:58.876
There's never only one
reason to change your life.

07:59.501 --> 08:02.001
Were you running
from something?

08:02.168 --> 08:04.709
Maybe what I had wasn't good for me.

08:06.418 --> 08:07.543
Besides,

08:08.584 --> 08:09.876
I like your country.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.001
That's not the custom here.

08:22.459 --> 08:25.043
Come on, I don't
like being rejected.

08:33.001 --> 08:34.333
What are you saying?

08:34.501 --> 08:35.876
I'm talking about basic rights.

08:36.043 --> 08:40.168
What rights? You're communists!
You want to bring communism to Spain...

08:40.333 --> 08:42.583
and you don't know what
that means. - Gentlemen, please.

08:42.751 --> 08:43.376
Shitty fascist!

08:43.543 --> 08:46.001
I don't want any
arguments, especially about politics.

08:46.168 --> 08:47.584
Let's go somewhere else.

10:30.626 --> 10:31.876
Pose for the photo.

10:32.043 --> 10:33.251
MARCH, 1936

10:33.418 --> 10:34.751
Make us look good.

10:34.918 --> 10:36.793
Not moving.
- Stand very still.

10:39.293 --> 10:40.251
There.

10:42.459 --> 10:44.376
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

10:45.293 --> 10:46.543
How are things?

10:48.043 --> 10:49.126
Very bad.

10:49.543 --> 10:51.126
Things are about to blow up.

10:51.293 --> 10:52.918
Will the army step in?

10:53.293 --> 10:54.168
Who knows.

10:54.334 --> 10:56.876
THEY WILL NOT PASS!
DEFEND MADRID

10:58.418 --> 11:00.918
NOVEMBER, 1936

11:10.418 --> 11:11.501
Push!

11:19.959 --> 11:21.668
Who is it?
- It's me.

11:25.126 --> 11:26.168
Well?

11:26.376 --> 11:27.751
Still nothing.

11:36.418 --> 11:38.001
Come on, a little more!

11:38.584 --> 11:39.418
Come on!

11:39.834 --> 11:41.126
Come on!

11:41.918 --> 11:43.001
Here it is!

11:56.376 --> 11:59.918
It's a girl, just as healthy
and strong as her mother.

12:18.251 --> 12:19.751
Your goddaughter.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.251
How are you?

12:36.709 --> 12:37.584
Fine.

12:40.543 --> 12:41.834
She's beautiful.

13:10.793 --> 13:11.751
Mate.

13:12.709 --> 13:15.334
APRIL, 1940

13:37.126 --> 13:38.293
I offer you a draw.

13:42.293 --> 13:43.209
Are you sure?

13:43.334 --> 13:44.334
Yes.

13:44.501 --> 13:45.376
Yes, Major.

13:45.543 --> 13:47.459
The situation allows for a draw.

13:52.251 --> 13:53.751
Then I'm honored.

13:55.126 --> 13:55.959
A draw.

13:57.459 --> 13:59.334
Understand my
enthusiasm, Padilla.

13:59.501 --> 14:02.001
It's the first time we've had a draw.
How long have we been playing?

14:02.126 --> 14:03.168
Over 6 months?

14:03.293 --> 14:06.334
Today you played very
differently than 6 months ago.

14:06.668 --> 14:08.168
Thanks to you, professor.

14:08.918 --> 14:09.793
In any case,

14:09.959 --> 14:12.834
I hope to beat you someday.
- Anything can happen.

14:13.001 --> 14:14.918
Let's not dream
about the impossible.

14:17.209 --> 14:18.418
Padilla.

14:20.668 --> 14:23.418
I'd like you to play for
the national championship again.

14:23.584 --> 14:27.001
To represent us around the
world and win prizes for Spain.

14:27.209 --> 14:28.876
I would be honored, Major.

14:29.043 --> 14:31.501
I know you can
make us very proud.

14:31.668 --> 14:36.543
There's only one bureaucratic
problem, but we'll solve it.

14:44.168 --> 14:45.876
And give me a pack.

14:47.293 --> 14:49.209
Okay, see you tomorrow.

14:49.376 --> 14:52.251
Congratulations on
your draw. - Thanks, Juanita.

15:02.918 --> 15:05.751
So you had a draw
with Major Hernandez.

15:06.418 --> 15:08.209
News travels fast.

15:08.376 --> 15:11.418
That fascist would have
to be reborn to draw with you.

15:11.584 --> 15:14.043
Don't pull my leg.
You let him.

15:15.626 --> 15:17.293
It's up to you.

15:17.501 --> 15:21.334
But I'd humiliate him every
time. No water for the enemy.

15:21.501 --> 15:24.418
Hernandez isn't a
bad person. - Not with you.

15:25.126 --> 15:27.084
Come on, I'll buy
you a glass of wine.

15:33.251 --> 15:34.626
Thanks,Paco.

15:35.626 --> 15:38.043
We're going to
Martin's shop later.

15:38.459 --> 15:39.709
That's risky.

15:39.876 --> 15:42.709
We have to do something,
things can't go on like this.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.834
Important people will be
there. Why don't you come?

15:45.001 --> 15:46.959
Javier, drop it.
You know what I think.

15:47.126 --> 15:50.501
The shop is safe.
And we need people like you.

15:50.709 --> 15:53.834
People with no record
who the military won't suspect.

15:54.251 --> 15:56.459
The war is over.
Get that into your head.

15:57.543 --> 15:58.876
You're not going to do anything?

15:59.209 --> 16:01.209
People only speak
nonsense in those meetings.

16:01.584 --> 16:03.501
They just fantasize about Russia

16:03.584 --> 16:06.876
and the proletariat revolution.
And I'm not a communist.

16:07.209 --> 16:08.501
Me neither.

16:09.376 --> 16:11.834
But the opposition to
fascism must be united.

16:12.084 --> 16:15.126
There are also socialists,
anarchists, liberals...

16:15.293 --> 16:16.626
It's about a common cause.

16:18.251 --> 16:19.751
I wish I could help you...

16:20.001 --> 16:22.709
and see that free society
you talk so much about.

16:23.001 --> 16:25.209
But I'm afraid we missed
our chance before the war.

16:25.376 --> 16:28.459
Don't start with '34,
the fight is very different now.

16:28.709 --> 16:31.168
Some of the people
there only want revenge.

16:31.334 --> 16:33.293
All sorts of people go, I know.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.834
But the only goal
is to restore democracy.

16:36.001 --> 16:39.168
And if more of us go, it's
easier to exclude the extremists.

16:39.334 --> 16:40.418
You're too idealistic.

16:43.793 --> 16:45.209
To the apolitical.

16:45.501 --> 16:46.876
To the stubborn.

16:52.168 --> 16:53.126
This...

16:53.584 --> 16:54.668
Is the king.

16:55.293 --> 16:56.751
Since he's very old,

16:56.918 --> 16:58.959
he can only take
one step at a time.

16:59.459 --> 17:00.501
But since he's in charge,

17:01.001 --> 17:02.668
he can take it
anywhere he wants.

17:03.751 --> 17:05.126
This is the rook.

17:05.376 --> 17:08.001
It's very, very strong.

17:10.001 --> 17:11.126
And this one...

17:11.751 --> 17:14.542
Is my favorite.
The knight.

17:15.417 --> 17:17.917
The only one that can
jump over the other pieces.

17:18.084 --> 17:19.542
All of them?

17:19.709 --> 17:21.209
All of them. Look.

17:26.334 --> 17:27.751
Margaux, shall
we go to the park?

17:29.168 --> 17:31.084
Let's let Daddy
think of some new moves.

17:35.043 --> 17:36.293
Say goodbye to Daddy.

17:36.626 --> 17:37.626
Goodbye!

17:37.793 --> 17:38.543
And in French?

17:38.709 --> 17:40.084
Goodbye, Daddy.
- Goodbye.

17:40.584 --> 17:41.959
Be nice to Mommy.

17:42.543 --> 17:43.501
See you soon.

18:12.626 --> 18:13.751
My dear Pierre.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.126
I need your help, please.

18:16.084 --> 18:17.751
Find me a job in France.

18:17.918 --> 18:20.043
I can't take this
crazy country anymore.

18:20.709 --> 18:23.376
Diego's still working
for the fascists for peanuts

18:23.543 --> 18:25.334
and I can't find work.

18:25.501 --> 18:27.209
Please, help me.

18:27.751 --> 18:30.918
If I can find work in France,
I can convince my husband to leave.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.543
Sometimes I think I'm
making Marianne unhappy.

18:49.709 --> 18:54.501
Don't be silly. She adores you,
even though you still can't believe it.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.251
I'm scared she might think
she'd be better off with Pierre.

18:57.418 --> 18:58.751
Why do you say that?

18:58.918 --> 19:00.418
She still writes him.

19:00.626 --> 19:02.626
That's normal,
they're good friends.

19:03.334 --> 19:06.168
I might not be living
up to her expectations.

19:06.334 --> 19:07.709
That's nonsense.

19:08.334 --> 19:09.751
Don't torture yourself.

19:10.543 --> 19:12.876
She keeps asking
me to move to France.

19:13.751 --> 19:16.709
No wonder.
This is a mouse trap.

19:16.918 --> 19:18.834
There's only room here
for people who think like them,

19:19.001 --> 19:21.793
or cynics who can
pretend all day long.

19:22.543 --> 19:24.543
Did you know
they arrested Julian?

19:24.751 --> 19:27.251
No, I didn't.
What do they accuse him of?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.626
Not much. Contraband.

19:29.793 --> 19:33.001
They'll let him go.
They could arrest half of Madrid.

19:33.626 --> 19:36.043
Maybe you could
intervene on his behalf.

19:36.334 --> 19:37.834
With Major Hernandez?

19:38.543 --> 19:39.918
It's not a good time.

19:40.584 --> 19:42.376
He asked me
to join the Falange

19:42.543 --> 19:46.251
so I could play in the Spanish
chess championship. And I said no.

19:47.626 --> 19:49.668
You dared to say no!

19:51.084 --> 19:52.793
Come over for dinner tonight.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.126
You can see the little one
and make Marianne happy.

19:56.501 --> 19:57.834
I can't tonight.

19:59.543 --> 20:00.876
Another meeting.

20:02.834 --> 20:04.584
We have to do
something, Diego.

20:04.751 --> 20:06.168
And it has to be you.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.626
There aren't
enough of you, Javier.

20:08.751 --> 20:10.876
The war was long
and families are broken.

20:10.959 --> 20:13.418
There won't be a revolution.
- I can't give up.

20:13.584 --> 20:16.334
And submit.
I don't want to live like this.

20:16.501 --> 20:18.543
I'm just worried about you.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.001
If you get caught,
you could be executed.

20:24.959 --> 20:26.459
I have to go.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.709
By the way, can you give
Marianne a message for me?

20:30.918 --> 20:31.959
Go ahead.

20:32.334 --> 20:33.501
Nothing important.

20:33.668 --> 20:36.834
If it's true what you said
about her getting tired of you,

20:37.293 --> 20:39.543
let her know
that I'm still single.

20:41.251 --> 20:43.959
See you tomorrow, Don Juan.
- See you tomorrow.

20:46.959 --> 20:50.334
And that little girl who was
as blonde and pretty as you are...

20:50.626 --> 20:54.293
one day told her father she
couldn't sleep because she was scared.

20:54.459 --> 20:55.793
And her father said:

20:55.959 --> 20:59.543
"If you dream about Daddy,
nothing bad can happen to you."

20:59.709 --> 21:02.834
And she did. And she
was never scared again.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.543
I love you.

21:10.043 --> 21:11.251
Good night.

21:22.918 --> 21:24.418
She's already asleep.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.751
She was asking
about you all afternoon.

21:30.334 --> 21:33.334
At least one of my two
women worries about me.

21:34.543 --> 21:36.834
You'll see when she's 15.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.543
What will happen then?

21:40.126 --> 21:42.043
She'll pay no attention to you.

21:43.543 --> 21:44.459
We'll see about that.

21:47.126 --> 21:48.543
Besides,

21:49.918 --> 21:51.876
I'll always have you.

22:50.126 --> 22:51.793
I thought we were friends.

22:53.501 --> 22:54.751
I don't understand.

22:56.501 --> 22:58.168
I haven't treated you well?

22:59.084 --> 23:00.376
Of course you have.

23:01.418 --> 23:03.168
Me and my family.

23:03.751 --> 23:07.376
Then why did you hide your friendship
with Javier Sanchez Medina from me?

23:08.543 --> 23:09.709
With Javier?

23:10.626 --> 23:11.793
He's a childhood friend.

23:11.959 --> 23:13.418
And a revolutionary.

23:13.709 --> 23:14.418
A Red!

23:15.251 --> 23:16.751
I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:17.168 --> 23:19.668
Beating me at
chess gives you no right...

23:19.834 --> 23:21.501
to insult my intelligence.

23:24.668 --> 23:26.376
Your friend died
yesterday in a raid.

23:29.251 --> 23:31.126
He tried to flee and was shot.

23:35.084 --> 23:37.709
Now they'll be tying loose
ends in an office somewhere.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.168
Sooner or later,
they'll go after you.

23:42.043 --> 23:43.834
And I won't be
able to help you.

23:51.001 --> 23:51.668
By the way,

23:53.376 --> 23:56.126
you and I did not
see each other today.

24:17.918 --> 24:20.584
MAY, 1940

24:27.709 --> 24:29.959
The sacrifice of the queen.

24:30.126 --> 24:32.251
It's an honor, Mr. Padilla, -

24:32.418 --> 24:34.584
to have you here
at our federation.

24:34.751 --> 24:36.376
What can I do for you?

24:36.543 --> 24:37.918
I need to work.

24:38.751 --> 24:39.793
Playing.

24:39.959 --> 24:41.251
Teaching. Anything.

24:42.043 --> 24:45.709
You can see we're not
going through the best of times.

24:47.376 --> 24:48.543
Half of Europe is at war...

24:48.709 --> 24:50.501
and the other half, 

24:50.918 --> 24:51.918
waiting.

24:52.418 --> 24:53.418
I'd accept anything.

24:54.959 --> 24:56.543
I'm sorry, maestro.

24:57.418 --> 24:59.668
Perhaps if things change...

25:00.668 --> 25:03.043
Then I won't take up
any more of your time.

25:03.209 --> 25:04.543
It was a pleasure.

25:04.793 --> 25:06.334
Here at the federation -

25:06.501 --> 25:07.668
we've studied that match a lot.

25:08.126 --> 25:08.959
Thank you.

25:13.959 --> 25:15.084
Goodbye.

25:16.126 --> 25:20.126
Should we pick up Mommy
at work and surprise her?

25:20.293 --> 25:21.418
Yes.
- Yes?

25:34.876 --> 25:36.543
HITLER INVADES THE NETHERLANDS

25:36.959 --> 25:38.918
Le Petit Journal, please.

25:39.834 --> 25:40.626
Thank you.

25:51.543 --> 25:54.126
Good day.
A bouquet of roses, please.

26:52.126 --> 26:53.376
Hi!

27:03.084 --> 27:04.668
Hi, sweetie.

27:07.918 --> 27:09.084
Hi.

27:10.543 --> 27:12.043
I thought you weren't coming.

27:12.209 --> 27:14.584
I got sidetracked after school.

27:14.834 --> 27:18.168
I went for coffee with some
girlfriends in the Place des Abbesses.

27:18.334 --> 27:20.793
Besides, there's nothing wrong
with you two waiting for me.

27:20.959 --> 27:22.793
It makes you
want to see me more.

27:24.126 --> 27:25.543
What are these roses?

27:28.543 --> 27:30.418
We went for a
walk this morning...

27:31.168 --> 27:33.001
and I bought them for you.

27:37.084 --> 27:38.751
I was with Pierre.

27:39.168 --> 27:40.209
In a cafe.

27:40.376 --> 27:42.626
He came to pick
me up after school.

27:42.834 --> 27:45.501
I thanked him for
getting me the job.

27:47.084 --> 27:48.584
Put them in a vase.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.501
They wither quickly without water.

27:57.918 --> 28:00.293
AUGUST, 1940

28:11.918 --> 28:12.751
Halt!

28:15.834 --> 28:17.418
You're going to
take our photograph.

28:17.876 --> 28:19.626
Sit together for the photo.

28:20.001 --> 28:21.084
Come here.

28:21.959 --> 28:23.626
Very nice, yes.

28:24.626 --> 28:25.834
Yes.

28:43.543 --> 28:45.751
EMPLOYEE WANTED

28:56.584 --> 28:58.251
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

28:58.626 --> 29:00.251
How can I help you?

29:00.418 --> 29:02.209
I saw the sign outside.

29:02.793 --> 29:04.001
I'm looking for work.

29:04.168 --> 29:05.459
Oh, the sign.

29:05.626 --> 29:09.584
The kid who worked for
me disappeared overnight.

29:09.751 --> 29:11.876
You know what
young people are like.

29:14.501 --> 29:15.876
Are you a Jew?

29:16.043 --> 29:17.001
No, I'm Spanish.

29:18.043 --> 29:19.293
My wife is French.

29:19.459 --> 29:20.918
Oh, Spanish.

29:21.668 --> 29:23.501
That's great.

29:23.668 --> 29:25.876
I'm a big admirer
of General Franco.

29:26.043 --> 29:28.584
He's done his
country a great service.

29:30.126 --> 29:32.584
I hope you're not...

29:32.751 --> 29:35.043
one of those communists
who illegally crossed the border...

29:36.293 --> 29:37.251
No, sir.

29:37.543 --> 29:40.709
But even if I were,
that shouldn't matter to you.

29:48.459 --> 29:49.668
Good day, gentlemen.

29:50.293 --> 29:51.751
Please, -

29:51.918 --> 29:52.959
look around.

29:53.126 --> 29:54.043
Do you like it?

29:58.376 --> 29:59.918
Go ahead and touch it.

30:10.834 --> 30:12.793
No playing at the table.

30:17.001 --> 30:18.584
We can go to the
Champ de Mars tomorrow.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.584
I'm sure it will
be a beautiful day.

30:22.918 --> 30:23.959
Whatever you want.

30:26.251 --> 30:28.543
You don't seem very
enthusiastic. Something wrong?

30:30.334 --> 30:31.626
Let's say...

30:32.126 --> 30:33.251
I'm surprised.

30:33.876 --> 30:35.459
You mean because of the Germans?

30:35.668 --> 30:37.168
What did they do now?

30:37.418 --> 30:38.376
I mean you.

30:39.751 --> 30:40.668
Me?

30:42.043 --> 30:43.876
Did I do something
that bothers you?

30:45.251 --> 30:46.626
Your double standard.

30:49.793 --> 30:51.626
I don't have
a double standard.

30:52.001 --> 30:52.876
Yes, you do.

30:55.793 --> 30:59.376
Like the antique salesman who
asked me if I was a communist or a Jew.

30:59.543 --> 31:01.126
Or the girls on the terraces...

31:01.293 --> 31:03.168
flirting with the Germans.

31:04.126 --> 31:06.751
You've been invaded and
you act like nothing's happened.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.084
You asked me to leave Spain

31:12.251 --> 31:14.959
because you couldn't
live under a fascist regime.

31:15.168 --> 31:17.668
And now you seem
comfortable among the Nazis.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.209
You're very wrong.

31:21.334 --> 31:22.709
We French hate the Nazis...

31:22.876 --> 31:25.168
and we're ashamed of this situation.

31:25.793 --> 31:27.584
But there's nothing we can do.

31:28.418 --> 31:30.376
Sometimes there's
nothing you can do.

31:35.084 --> 31:37.084
I'm sorry I'm not as
brave as you thought.

31:41.751 --> 31:43.084
Open the door!

31:46.084 --> 31:47.793
Open up, police!

31:59.668 --> 32:00.834
Good evening, sir.

32:01.001 --> 32:04.543
Does the Spaniard Diego
Padillo live in this domicile?

32:05.459 --> 32:06.876
Yes, I'm Diego Padilla.

32:07.084 --> 32:08.876
Show me your papers.

32:09.459 --> 32:11.834
I don't have them on me.
They're in the bedroom.

32:12.209 --> 32:13.626
Go and get them.

32:13.793 --> 32:14.501
One moment.

32:41.251 --> 32:41.959
Come with us.

32:42.459 --> 32:43.751
<i>Is there</i> a <i>problem?</i>

32:43.918 --> 32:46.918
You must accompany us
to the prefecture. Let's go.

32:47.084 --> 32:48.668
Wait, what is this?
He's done nothing wrong.

32:48.834 --> 32:52.418
It's a routine document check.

32:58.293 --> 32:59.709
I'll be back soon.

33:02.876 --> 33:05.543
Don't worry, I have
everything in order.

34:05.918 --> 34:09.583
POLICE REPORT

34:17.958 --> 34:20.333
Place your
belongings on the table.

34:35.876 --> 34:37.793
The watch and ring too.

34:51.876 --> 34:52.458
Get undressed.

35:55.709 --> 35:57.376
Good morning, Sophie.
- Good morning.

35:58.918 --> 36:00.876
Mr. Pierre Boileau is here.

36:02.168 --> 36:03.043
Right.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.876
You'd better wait
for me here, Marianne.

36:15.584 --> 36:16.834
Mr. Lambert...

36:21.793 --> 36:23.751
Please wait here.

36:43.626 --> 36:45.626
Name, nationality, profession.

36:46.584 --> 36:48.168
Diego Padilla, Spanish.

36:48.376 --> 36:49.418
Chess player.

37:01.001 --> 37:02.334
With which hand do you play?

37:03.543 --> 37:04.376
With my right.

37:11.834 --> 37:14.168
Playing chess is
not a profession.

37:15.251 --> 37:17.918
I also worked as a
manager in a warehouse.

37:22.209 --> 37:23.584
Why did you
leave your country?

37:23.751 --> 37:26.168
My wife is French.
She wanted to work here.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.959
Are you a spy?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.209
No.

37:42.293 --> 37:43.376
Tell him I'm not a spy!

37:45.084 --> 37:46.001
Please!

37:47.251 --> 37:47.751
Tell him!

37:50.168 --> 37:50.834
Please!

37:52.209 --> 37:53.168
Please!

37:53.751 --> 37:54.709
Please!

38:13.918 --> 38:14.959
Well?

38:16.209 --> 38:19.584
We'll have to front them money,
you know how these things are.

38:19.751 --> 38:20.959
But it's all worked out.

38:22.168 --> 38:23.251
Thank you.

38:26.834 --> 38:27.918
Thank you.

38:28.793 --> 38:30.043
Shall we?

38:47.959 --> 38:49.668
We bring a prisoner.

39:44.501 --> 39:49.626
And then the mother squirrel
says to the daughter squirrel:

39:50.543 --> 39:53.501
"Don't climb this
tree. It's too tall."

39:53.668 --> 39:54.918
"You might fall."

39:55.709 --> 39:57.834
When is Daddy coming?

39:59.334 --> 40:00.793
Soon, sweetie.

40:03.251 --> 40:05.001
Let's go to sleep.

40:05.709 --> 40:06.876
Good night.

40:09.543 --> 40:10.543
Go on.

41:42.918 --> 41:44.001
You're Spanish, right?

41:45.918 --> 41:47.001
Yes.

41:47.168 --> 41:49.251
We're the only
Spaniards in here.

41:49.418 --> 41:50.709
All the rest are French,

41:50.876 --> 41:53.376
most accused of
being spies or saboteurs.

41:53.668 --> 41:54.918
Where are you from?

41:56.834 --> 41:57.584
Madrid.

41:58.168 --> 41:59.459
I'm from Toledo.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.126
I was in the
popular militia. And you?

42:03.918 --> 42:04.959
Sorry.

42:05.459 --> 42:06.543
I ask too many questions.

42:06.709 --> 42:09.418
I just haven't talked
to anyone in so long...

42:11.376 --> 42:12.293
You want some?

42:13.793 --> 42:14.376
Thanks.

42:21.251 --> 42:23.501
When all was lost,
I hid in the mountains.

42:24.209 --> 42:26.793
Then I crossed over into
France to fight the Nazis, but...

42:26.959 --> 42:28.751
They caught me right away.

42:31.251 --> 42:33.126
Hadn't you had enough?

42:33.793 --> 42:35.459
It looks like
you hadn't either.

42:36.793 --> 42:38.709
Why did they arrest you?

42:40.168 --> 42:40.959
I don't know.

42:41.668 --> 42:44.418
You could never tell by
the beating they gave you.

42:47.251 --> 42:47.959
My name's Pablo.

42:50.168 --> 42:50.834
Diego.

42:55.084 --> 42:56.626
There's a woman in your life.

42:57.168 --> 42:58.168
Someone named Marianne.

42:59.168 --> 43:00.709
You must really love her.

43:00.876 --> 43:01.793
How do you know?

43:01.959 --> 43:03.418
You talk about
her in your dreams.

43:05.334 --> 43:06.501
Have you got kids?

43:06.668 --> 43:08.043
A four-year-old girl.

43:09.043 --> 43:09.793
Her name's Margaux.

43:12.668 --> 43:13.626
Are you married?

43:14.751 --> 43:16.751
My wife was
killed by a grenade.

43:17.626 --> 43:19.668
We didn't have
time to have kids.

43:20.376 --> 43:21.293
I'm sorry.

43:21.459 --> 43:22.501
No.

43:24.418 --> 43:27.251
What did you do to the
Nazis to get locked up in here?

43:27.959 --> 43:28.709
I don't know.

43:30.376 --> 43:32.001
Seriously, I have no idea.

43:33.543 --> 43:35.793
I don't even know
what kind of prison this is.

43:36.168 --> 43:38.584
This is SS central in Paris.

43:39.793 --> 43:43.084
Supposedly those of us here
have information they want.

43:44.001 --> 43:46.668
They'll squeeze us
until they get it or kill us.

43:50.126 --> 43:52.334
We're official enemies
of the Third Reich.

44:09.418 --> 44:10.918
We're going home, darling.

44:11.084 --> 44:12.418
And Daddy?

44:12.793 --> 44:14.668
I'm sure he'll
get out tomorrow.

44:31.959 --> 44:33.168
Ma 'am... Ma 'am!

44:34.209 --> 44:35.501
I said not to go in.

44:37.668 --> 44:38.834
I'm sorry, sir...

44:39.001 --> 44:40.209
It's okay, Sophie.
Leave us alone.

44:41.709 --> 44:43.709
<i>Please, sit down.
- Mr. Lambert.</i>

44:44.501 --> 44:47.001
Yesterday I spent the whole
afternoon outside the prison...

44:47.168 --> 44:49.376
in the rain with my
daughter because you lied to us.

44:49.543 --> 44:50.251
That's incorrect.

44:50.418 --> 44:51.543
Incorrect?

44:52.126 --> 44:55.793
Is it correct to take
money to bribe the Germans?

44:57.501 --> 44:59.918
It was all my savings
and I have nothing left.

45:00.543 --> 45:03.584
Asking me to wait for Diego
because he was going to be freed?

45:03.751 --> 45:04.918
Is that correct too?

45:07.293 --> 45:08.543
If you're a man,

45:09.001 --> 45:10.751
respect your
agreement with Pierre Boileau...

45:10.918 --> 45:13.334
and free my
husband immediately.

45:13.501 --> 45:16.793
Things aren't that simple,
ma 'am. Especially with the Germans.

45:17.376 --> 45:19.001
Believe me, I did
everything in my power

45:19.168 --> 45:21.043
to free your husband.

45:21.501 --> 45:22.834
And it bothers me...

45:23.251 --> 45:25.084
that you doubt my word.

45:27.084 --> 45:29.293
A Nazi sergeant took
the money and told me...

45:29.459 --> 45:32.209
the prisoner would be
freed yesterday afternoon.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.126
I called this morning to check.

45:39.251 --> 45:41.709
I'm sorry to have to inform you...

45:41.876 --> 45:44.043
but your husband was...

45:45.293 --> 45:46.584
Executed.

45:55.501 --> 45:57.834
Sophie, please come in here.

47:03.626 --> 47:06.834
The prefect just told me.
I came right away to get you.

47:08.501 --> 47:09.834
It's my fault.

47:11.168 --> 47:14.209
I'm the one who made
him come to this damn city.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.543
He didn't want
to, I forced him.

47:17.709 --> 47:19.418
No, it's not your fault.

47:19.584 --> 47:22.001
It's nobody's fault, Marianne.

47:23.084 --> 47:25.251
It's this terrible war.

47:28.584 --> 47:30.584
What am I going
to tell Margaux?

47:32.459 --> 47:35.251
Don't worry about that now.
Don't worry about anything.

47:35.418 --> 47:37.168
I'll take care of you both.

47:39.501 --> 47:41.584
We had an argument.

47:42.876 --> 47:44.834
The day they took him away.

47:46.959 --> 47:50.668
His last moment with me
was a goddamn argument!

48:04.126 --> 48:06.459
Please, take me home.

48:08.376 --> 48:11.584
I want to cry
for my husband alone.

48:39.001 --> 48:40.334
Robert Andrezowski.

48:45.626 --> 48:47.251
Arthur Belvezet.

48:53.334 --> 48:54.959
Alfred Thiebault.

49:00.001 --> 49:00.668
Raoul Manesse.

49:07.793 --> 49:09.084
Raoul Manesse.

49:15.376 --> 49:16.501
Raoul Manesse.

49:33.751 --> 49:35.084
Raoul Manesse!

50:00.501 --> 50:01.918
Raoul Manesse?

50:06.126 --> 50:07.501
That's Raoul Manesse.

50:11.376 --> 50:12.543
That's him.

50:14.209 --> 50:16.126
Please, don't shoot!

50:16.626 --> 50:17.543
Are you Raoul Manesse?

50:41.126 --> 50:42.418
You have to
obey these bastards.

50:43.876 --> 50:45.418
Where do they take them?

50:45.876 --> 50:47.209
To the firing squad.

50:53.251 --> 50:54.918
Good night, my love.

50:55.168 --> 50:58.293
Good night. I'm going
to dream about Daddy.

51:22.543 --> 51:24.668
<i>Yes, I know,
I haven't paid the rent.</i>

51:24.834 --> 51:26.668
I'm very sorry.
Give me a few more days.

51:26.834 --> 51:28.751
It's hard for
everyone, ma 'am.

51:28.918 --> 51:31.876
I'm sorry about what
happened to your husband,

51:32.043 --> 51:34.043
but I have a
family to feed too.

51:35.168 --> 51:37.751
Please, give me 2 or
3 days. I'll find the money.

51:37.918 --> 51:40.126
Okay, three more days.

51:40.334 --> 51:43.501
But that's all.
If you can't pay me,

51:43.668 --> 51:45.168
you'll have to leave.

52:14.209 --> 52:16.209
Bernard Herbet.

52:19.959 --> 52:21.751
Jacques Lecomte.

52:25.084 --> 52:27.084
Charles Bardon.

52:27.834 --> 52:29.793
Maxime Courdant.

52:36.209 --> 52:38.626
When I get out of here,
I'm going to South America.

52:39.668 --> 52:41.418
To Chile or Argentina.

52:42.543 --> 52:45.959
I'll stowaway on a merchant ship
to a place where nobody knows me.

52:46.126 --> 52:49.918
To start over far away
from this Europe full of fanatics.

52:51.084 --> 52:52.834
I'll start a business there.

52:53.376 --> 52:54.876
A tailor shop.

52:55.918 --> 52:59.168
My father taught me the
trade and I was a good apprentice.

52:59.668 --> 53:01.584
Merida's Tailor Shop.

53:02.918 --> 53:04.376
What do you think?

53:05.418 --> 53:07.001
Everything will come.

53:07.376 --> 53:08.834
You'll see.

53:15.418 --> 53:17.168
I worshipped my father.

53:19.418 --> 53:22.834
He's the one who taught me
how to play chess when I was little.

53:23.334 --> 53:25.084
He always said:

53:25.751 --> 53:28.043
"You'll be a champion someday."

53:29.668 --> 53:31.251
But he couldn't see it.

53:31.584 --> 53:33.543
He died when I was 12.

53:36.334 --> 53:38.418
Now I just want to go
home and be with my wife.

53:40.751 --> 53:42.418
And see my
daughter grow up.

53:44.834 --> 53:47.334
You can see I'm
not a man with big plans.

53:53.376 --> 53:55.084
There's something
strange about you.

53:56.293 --> 53:58.876
I can't quite figure it out,
but I think you're a good person.

53:59.751 --> 54:02.501
Too good for times like these.

54:13.501 --> 54:14.834
Diego Padilla.

54:17.959 --> 54:18.959
Diego.

54:19.543 --> 54:21.918
Don't give
them any satisfaction.

55:20.543 --> 55:22.751
Name, nationality, profession.

55:26.459 --> 55:27.584
Diego Padilla.

55:28.126 --> 55:29.376
Spanish.

55:40.668 --> 55:41.584
Warehouse manager.

55:49.543 --> 55:51.793
Aren't you a chess player?

55:52.543 --> 55:54.959
I thought you didn't
consider that a profession.

56:12.043 --> 56:12.793
Move.

57:15.168 --> 57:16.459
It looks like you've won.

57:20.043 --> 57:21.668
You haven't lost yet.

57:44.293 --> 57:45.251
Very well.

57:45.709 --> 57:47.084
Let's see how.

58:16.709 --> 58:17.709
Thank you.

58:22.293 --> 58:23.876
You have to
be strong, Marianne.

58:25.918 --> 58:27.334
I couldn't even bury him.

58:27.876 --> 58:29.084
I know.

58:29.334 --> 58:31.501
I've asked the authorities
for his body several times,

58:31.668 --> 58:34.043
but the SS colonel in
charge, a man named Maier,

58:34.209 --> 58:37.959
refuses. If I insist,
I'll end up annoying them,

58:38.126 --> 58:39.751
and I don't think
that's good for us.

58:39.918 --> 58:42.668
I'm very grateful for
everything you're doing.

58:43.751 --> 58:45.793
I don't want you
to keep taking risks.

58:46.334 --> 58:49.626
I'll do anything you
ask, Marianne. Trust me.

58:56.293 --> 58:57.751
I need some money, Pierre.

58:59.626 --> 59:01.543
I can't pay my rent.

59:04.834 --> 59:06.668
I'm going to
do something better.

59:07.501 --> 59:10.793
I wanted to ask you
before. I know it's still recent,

59:11.584 --> 59:14.334
but I'd like you and
Margaux to come and live here.

59:14.709 --> 59:16.626
You'd be my guests.

59:17.668 --> 59:19.751
I want you to have
everything you need.

59:20.209 --> 59:21.959
You're very good to us.

59:22.668 --> 59:23.918
Thank you very much.

59:25.168 --> 59:26.209
But I can't do that.

59:27.793 --> 59:28.751
You're right.

59:29.334 --> 59:30.959
It's too soon.

59:38.751 --> 59:39.918
See you soon.

01:00:00.584 --> 01:00:02.209
You were right.

01:00:03.459 --> 01:00:05.334
I admit that
you surprised me.

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:44.209
Draw.

01:00:52.709 --> 01:00:54.209
Take this man to his cell.

01:00:56.709 --> 01:00:57.918
Kauffman!

01:00:59.168 --> 01:01:00.209
Without violence.

01:01:24.209 --> 01:01:26.209
What happened?
Are you okay? - Yes.

01:01:26.793 --> 01:01:28.209
They didn't do
anything to you?

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:30.418
They interrogated me again.

01:01:32.543 --> 01:01:33.876
Without torture?

01:01:34.209 --> 01:01:35.251
That's weird.

01:01:35.418 --> 01:01:37.668
You don't believe me?
- I'm just saying it's weird.

01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:40.501
I wouldn't want to
be wrong about you.

01:01:40.876 --> 01:01:42.751
Actually they
wanted me to play chess.

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:45.876
Chess?

01:01:55.418 --> 01:01:56.584
Have you got another one?

01:02:15.668 --> 01:02:17.418
The king moves
one square at a time.

01:02:17.584 --> 01:02:19.293
Sure, because he has gout.

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:22.918
What I didn't understand from
yesterday is the passing pawn.

01:02:23.126 --> 01:02:27.126
It's a pawn with no
enemy pawn that can stop it.

01:02:28.001 --> 01:02:29.209
A fugitive pawn.

01:02:36.751 --> 01:02:38.251
Camille Gerbaud.

01:02:38.418 --> 01:02:39.876
Jean-Luc Phillip Moreau.

01:02:40.043 --> 01:02:41.709
Marcel Gandriaux.

01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:01.918
I bring the prisoner.

01:04:23.043 --> 01:04:24.751
Anton Bruckner.

01:04:25.959 --> 01:04:29.043
The greatest symphony
writer after Beethoven.

01:04:29.293 --> 01:04:32.626
That great little
Austrian had only one flaw.

01:04:33.584 --> 01:04:34.876
His religiousness.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:39.751
Are you religious?

01:04:40.668 --> 01:04:42.793
I haven't gone to
church in a long time.

01:04:43.584 --> 01:04:45.501
Don't be afraid to answer.

01:04:46.709 --> 01:04:50.376
This is only a conversation
between two civilized men.

01:04:52.084 --> 01:04:53.834
Do you believe in God?

01:04:56.334 --> 01:04:57.876
Yes, I'm Catholic.

01:04:59.668 --> 01:05:02.043
So you think...

01:05:02.626 --> 01:05:04.043
You have an immortal soul -

01:05:04.584 --> 01:05:07.834
and that if you act
according to the commandments,

01:05:08.001 --> 01:05:10.918
you'll be eternally
rewarded in Heaven.

01:05:12.918 --> 01:05:14.251
Faith is hard to explain.

01:05:15.209 --> 01:05:17.376
And even harder
to understand...

01:05:17.543 --> 01:05:20.251
when an intelligent man has it.

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:22.501
I don't believe in God.

01:05:22.876 --> 01:05:24.876
Not in yours or any other.

01:05:25.293 --> 01:05:28.959
I believe the gods were
invented by primitive men...

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:31.668
puzzled by the
mysteries of nature...

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:33.209
and that their Bible,

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:34.668
so filled with incest,

01:05:35.043 --> 01:05:37.209
miracles and murderers,

01:05:37.543 --> 01:05:39.918
is the biggest literary
fallacy in all of Europe.

01:05:40.084 --> 01:05:42.876
People are ignorant
and must be educated,

01:05:43.043 --> 01:05:46.168
but not by the disgusting
coercion of Jewish morals!

01:05:55.126 --> 01:05:56.793
Please, sit down.

01:05:58.751 --> 01:06:01.626
I didn't call you here
to offend your convictions.

01:06:05.793 --> 01:06:07.709
You owe me a rematch.

01:06:13.293 --> 01:06:17.376
Allow me the privilege
of playing white again.

01:06:47.834 --> 01:06:48.668
Checkmate.

01:06:49.959 --> 01:06:51.543
Put the pieces back.

01:07:49.043 --> 01:07:50.168
Checkmate.

01:07:54.751 --> 01:07:56.168
Starting tomorrow,

01:07:56.584 --> 01:07:58.709
you will give me
lessons in theory...

01:07:58.876 --> 01:08:01.168
to prevent such humiliation.

01:08:05.126 --> 01:08:07.168
From now on bring
him clean and shaven.

01:08:07.334 --> 01:08:08.209
Yes, sir.

01:08:26.834 --> 01:08:27.501
Undress him.

01:08:28.251 --> 01:08:29.334
Get undressed!

01:08:30.167 --> 01:08:31.126
Take off your clothes!

01:08:31.459 --> 01:08:33.376
Faster!
- What stinks,

01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:36.084
your food?
- No.

01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:39.126
Must be the Spanish dog.

01:08:40.501 --> 01:08:41.584
Faster!

01:08:43.709 --> 01:08:45.209
We need to wash him.

01:08:47.626 --> 01:08:49.001
In the cage!

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.959
Get in there!

01:08:57.334 --> 01:08:58.626
Step aside!

01:09:27.584 --> 01:09:30.042
Moving the bishop
puts your king at risk.

01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:03.751
Checkmate.

01:10:07.293 --> 01:10:08.668
What do you mean, Checkmate?

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:10.334
We're only starting.

01:10:10.668 --> 01:10:11.709
Shepherd's checkmate.

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:13.376
Oh, well.

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:17.043
You play worse than
my four-year-old daughter.

01:10:18.668 --> 01:10:19.834
Come on, play again.

01:10:38.543 --> 01:10:40.293
Can I ask a favor of you?

01:10:43.126 --> 01:10:43.959
Go ahead.

01:10:46.001 --> 01:10:48.293
I'd like to
prove my innocence.

01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:52.709
If you wish to remain alive,

01:10:53.126 --> 01:10:54.918
just do as you're told.

01:10:59.584 --> 01:11:01.168
In this building -

01:11:01.334 --> 01:11:02.959
people die every day -

01:11:03.126 --> 01:11:05.376
for accusations
less serious than yours.

01:11:07.043 --> 01:11:09.043
Don't make the
mistake of thinking...

01:11:09.209 --> 01:11:12.251
that you have the power
to change the course of events.

01:11:44.459 --> 01:11:45.459
Pablo!

01:11:50.376 --> 01:11:51.876
Pablo!

01:11:52.251 --> 01:11:53.626
Pablo!

01:12:39.418 --> 01:12:41.126
What's wrong
with you today?

01:12:45.126 --> 01:12:46.793
Have you lost your faith?

01:12:51.168 --> 01:12:52.668
You don't believe
in God anymore?

01:13:11.709 --> 01:13:12.793
<i>Open LIP-</i>

01:13:38.626 --> 01:13:39.626
You...

01:13:39.793 --> 01:13:41.126
Dead!

01:14:12.668 --> 01:14:14.751
By moving your knight
you lose the center of the board...

01:14:16.043 --> 01:14:18.001
and your general
position is weakened.

01:16:47.084 --> 01:16:48.001
JULY, 1941

01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:50.501
Germany is at
war with Russia now.

01:16:51.751 --> 01:16:53.334
It's the most
important decision...

01:16:53.501 --> 01:16:55.459
the fuhrer has made, -

01:16:55.626 --> 01:16:58.626
but there was no other
option with the Russian dogs.

01:17:00.584 --> 01:17:04.543
Communism is the most
irrational form of government.

01:17:09.001 --> 01:17:10.751
Would you like
a glass of brandy?

01:17:10.918 --> 01:17:11.876
No, thank you.

01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:16.501
Perhaps you
prefer something else.

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:20.959
I'd like to be able to
write my wife and daughter.

01:17:33.543 --> 01:17:36.543
You can write your
family once a month.

01:17:37.501 --> 01:17:40.418
With the envelopes open
so that I may inspect them.

01:17:40.584 --> 01:17:42.584
But don't ask
them to write you back.

01:17:43.751 --> 01:17:46.876
You can receive no
correspondence from the outside.

01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:57.584
Dear Marianne and Margaux.

01:17:58.668 --> 01:18:00.543
Today marks one
year since my arrest.

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:01.709
AUGUST 19TH, 1941

01:18:07.418 --> 01:18:09.918
And for the first time
I am allowed to write to you.

01:18:16.334 --> 01:18:18.959
I think about you
both all the time.

01:18:20.126 --> 01:18:22.043
The memory of
our love gives me...

01:18:22.209 --> 01:18:24.126
the strength to keep fighting.

01:18:24.293 --> 01:18:25.876
NOVEMBER 5TH, 1942

01:18:28.168 --> 01:18:30.084
Sometimes I think
God is testing me,

01:18:31.876 --> 01:18:33.626
because he has forgotten me.

01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:39.709
But I promise you
that nothing or no one

01:18:40.209 --> 01:18:44.084
will keep us apart or
take our past away from us.

01:18:59.043 --> 01:19:00.001
Merry Christmas!

01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:09.293
Not only the
past we've shared,

01:19:10.209 --> 01:19:12.334
but also the past
we've been deprived of.

01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:13.709
JULY 12TH, 1943

01:19:40.334 --> 01:19:41.418
Come with me.

01:19:43.334 --> 01:19:44.626
Let's go!!

01:20:10.459 --> 01:20:12.959
I didn't bring you
here to play chess today.

01:20:13.834 --> 01:20:15.001
Things are changing.

01:20:15.793 --> 01:20:17.334
It's not like four years ago.

01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:22.793
The Americans landed in
Normandy some time ago...

01:20:23.793 --> 01:20:26.209
and they're at
the gates of Paris.

01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:32.084
The Fuhrer -

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:35.876
has decided to
execute all prisoners...

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:38.501
and blow up this building.

01:20:39.918 --> 01:20:41.084
However, -

01:20:47.959 --> 01:20:51.418
I'm not willing to
send you to your death.

01:20:54.834 --> 01:20:59.959
I've known for a long
time that you aren't a spy.

01:21:02.543 --> 01:21:05.376
You knew I was
innocent. - That's right.

01:21:05.543 --> 01:21:08.001
But your life was worth
very little on the street.

01:21:08.168 --> 01:21:10.751
You might say I
was protecting you.

01:21:10.918 --> 01:21:14.126
Although you don't know it,
you have influential enemies.

01:21:15.834 --> 01:21:17.668
I don't have any
enemies in France.

01:21:17.959 --> 01:21:19.918
We all have enemies.

01:21:20.334 --> 01:21:22.543
Pierre Boileau,
do you know him?

01:21:22.876 --> 01:21:24.126
He was my wife's friend.

01:21:24.293 --> 01:21:25.834
Hers, perhaps,

01:21:26.001 --> 01:21:28.293
but it doesn't
seem he was yours.

01:21:28.626 --> 01:21:32.834
Pierre Boileau reported
you accusing you of espionage.

01:21:35.584 --> 01:21:37.793
Why didn't you release me
when you found out it was false?

01:21:38.501 --> 01:21:39.918
Out of selfishness.

01:21:40.793 --> 01:21:43.584
I found life in this
prison too tedious.

01:21:43.793 --> 01:21:46.584
And the chance to
play chess against someone...

01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:48.209
with your talent...

01:21:48.501 --> 01:21:50.918
was an extraordinary relief for me.

01:22:07.084 --> 01:22:09.084
Those are my letters.
- Yes.

01:22:09.626 --> 01:22:11.376
They never left here.

01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:15.376
I let you write them
to keep your spirits up,

01:22:15.751 --> 01:22:18.126
but they never left my office.

01:22:19.209 --> 01:22:20.168
Take them.

01:22:30.918 --> 01:22:31.668
Reinke.

01:22:34.334 --> 01:22:36.001
Free this man.

01:22:40.209 --> 01:22:41.293
I hope...

01:22:41.459 --> 01:22:44.918
You understand the
exception I'm making with you.

01:23:23.251 --> 01:23:24.709
Get out of here!

01:25:05.668 --> 01:25:06.626
Marianne!

01:25:13.668 --> 01:25:14.459
Marianne!

01:25:19.793 --> 01:25:20.668
Please!

01:25:37.584 --> 01:25:39.209
We don't have
anything to give.

01:25:39.376 --> 01:25:40.418
Go away.

01:25:41.126 --> 01:25:42.793
I'm not a beggar.

01:25:44.168 --> 01:25:45.418
I know you.

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:47.751
You're that Spaniard...

01:25:47.918 --> 01:25:50.543
who was arrested
for being a communist.

01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:52.501
The accusation was false.

01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:54.209
That's why they released me.

01:25:54.376 --> 01:25:57.501
<i>I don't care if you're
</i> a <i>communist or not.</i>

01:25:57.918 --> 01:26:01.834
They killed my husband for
collaborating with the Resistance.

01:26:02.334 --> 01:26:05.334
Everyone thought
you were dead.

01:26:07.084 --> 01:26:09.501
Do you know where
my wife and daughter are?

01:26:10.168 --> 01:26:13.126
They left Paris
two years ago.

01:26:15.418 --> 01:26:17.459
Do you know
where they went?

01:26:17.626 --> 01:26:19.418
They went to Bordeaux.

01:26:20.293 --> 01:26:23.834
With a man
named Pierre Boileau.

01:26:25.918 --> 01:26:28.543
Your wife Marianne
thought you were dead.

01:26:31.209 --> 01:26:33.584
You're going to look
for them, aren't you?

01:26:34.959 --> 01:26:36.126
What else can I do?

01:26:36.584 --> 01:26:38.459
They left an address.

01:26:38.668 --> 01:26:40.084
For their mail.

01:26:41.043 --> 01:26:43.501
I'll prepare you
something, it's a long way.

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:45.709
Thank you.

01:27:44.918 --> 01:27:46.043
Good day, sir.

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:47.626
Good day.

01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:50.876
<i>Isn't it too hot
to be walking?</i>

01:27:51.334 --> 01:27:52.293
I'm getting used to it.

01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:55.834
I've walked all
the way from Paris.

01:27:56.668 --> 01:27:59.251
It's about 500 km on foot.

01:27:59.543 --> 01:28:00.876
You're Spanish, huh?

01:28:01.168 --> 01:28:02.834
I recognized your accent.

01:28:03.376 --> 01:28:05.251
How far are you going?

01:28:05.543 --> 01:28:06.834
To your country?

01:28:07.793 --> 01:28:08.543
To Bordeaux.

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:11.126
It's only 40 kilometers.

01:28:11.959 --> 01:28:13.751
Come on, get on.

01:28:14.001 --> 01:28:15.793
I'm going to Bordeaux too.

01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:49.793
Why are they
doing that to them?

01:28:50.793 --> 01:28:52.543
They're collaborators.

01:28:53.793 --> 01:28:57.543
It's their punishment
for being with a German.

01:29:00.918 --> 01:29:03.584
The house you're looking
for is at the end of that road.

01:29:08.459 --> 01:29:09.751
Thanks, my friend.

01:29:10.209 --> 01:29:12.251
If you stay in Bordeaux,
come and see me.

01:29:12.418 --> 01:29:14.668
I promise to give you
some more of that wine.

01:29:15.168 --> 01:29:16.876
See you soon.
- See you soon.

01:30:25.334 --> 01:30:26.834
Good day.
Who are you?

01:30:29.084 --> 01:30:29.751
Margaux, who is it?

01:30:30.918 --> 01:30:32.293
A beggar.

01:30:43.376 --> 01:30:44.959
Margaux, leave us alone.

01:30:46.501 --> 01:30:47.668
Goodbye.

01:30:57.376 --> 01:30:58.584
Hello, Marianne.

01:31:15.084 --> 01:31:17.459
They told me you were dead.

01:31:17.626 --> 01:31:20.043
That the Nazis
had executed you.

01:31:21.834 --> 01:31:23.501
Where were you
this whole time?

01:31:25.459 --> 01:31:26.626
In prison.

01:31:29.668 --> 01:31:31.168
I'm sorry, Diego.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:34.876
I don't know how to react.

01:31:35.751 --> 01:31:37.668
Please, give me time...

01:31:39.543 --> 01:31:41.251
Margaux looks beautiful.

01:31:44.043 --> 01:31:45.834
She's all grown up now.

01:31:48.668 --> 01:31:51.334
And the way I look,
she thought I was a beggar.

01:31:52.709 --> 01:31:53.709
Come.

01:31:54.418 --> 01:31:57.001
I'll give you clean clothes
and you can take a bath.

01:32:13.251 --> 01:32:14.209
Here.

01:32:16.001 --> 01:32:18.209
I'll make you
something to eat meanwhile.

01:32:18.959 --> 01:32:20.043
Thank you.

01:34:07.668 --> 01:34:09.543
Please, sit down.

01:34:18.584 --> 01:34:21.501
Diego, a lot has happened
since we last saw each other.

01:34:21.668 --> 01:34:22.959
It's very hard to explain.

01:34:24.209 --> 01:34:25.876
Do you know
why I was arrested?

01:34:26.459 --> 01:34:29.459
They said you'd been
accused of being a communist.

01:34:30.626 --> 01:34:32.418
I never understood
why they locked you up.

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.251
Someone reported me with lies.

01:34:36.751 --> 01:34:38.001
Someone influential.

01:34:38.168 --> 01:34:39.834
But you had no enemies.

01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:41.584
That's what I thought, Marianne.

01:34:42.959 --> 01:34:44.293
That I had no enemies.

01:34:48.376 --> 01:34:50.043
Are you happy with Pierre?

01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:52.459
He treats me very well.

01:34:52.668 --> 01:34:55.251
And he's a good
father to Margaux.

01:34:57.001 --> 01:34:58.126
And Margaux?

01:34:59.543 --> 01:35:00.834
Does she remember me?

01:35:01.001 --> 01:35:03.168
She was very little
when you were arrested.

01:35:04.043 --> 01:35:07.626
The first months she asked about
you a lot and I didn't know what to say.

01:35:08.793 --> 01:35:12.501
She must have noticed that her
questions made me sad and after a while...

01:35:12.793 --> 01:35:14.626
She stopped talking about you.

01:35:15.543 --> 01:35:17.709
I may have been wrong, but...

01:35:17.918 --> 01:35:21.001
I thought it was better
if she forgot you quickly.

01:35:22.626 --> 01:35:25.959
And if there was nothing at
home to remind her of her father.

01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:29.918
I've come to find out
if I still have a family.

01:35:30.626 --> 01:35:33.001
Things can't go
back to how they were.

01:35:33.584 --> 01:35:35.001
Or change all of a sudden.

01:35:36.834 --> 01:35:40.668
At first I tried not to
get you out of my life, but...

01:35:40.918 --> 01:35:42.251
It's been four years.

01:35:43.168 --> 01:35:44.793
And you were dead.

01:35:45.584 --> 01:35:47.584
I'm not here to take
Margaux away from you,

01:35:47.751 --> 01:35:49.376
but I won't give her up.

01:35:50.834 --> 01:35:53.418
I know I have nothing
to offer her right now,

01:35:54.334 --> 01:35:55.334
but things could change.

01:35:57.709 --> 01:35:59.543
She's happy here.

01:36:00.584 --> 01:36:03.251
And some day she'll
inherit Pierre's fortune.

01:36:03.834 --> 01:36:05.543
Please, try to understand.

01:36:06.584 --> 01:36:07.959
And with you...

01:36:10.126 --> 01:36:11.543
Look at you, Diego.

01:36:13.293 --> 01:36:15.084
I'm sorry.

01:36:57.168 --> 01:36:58.876
What's your horse's name?

01:36:59.793 --> 01:37:01.209
It doesn't have a name.

01:37:04.001 --> 01:37:05.459
Shall we give it one?

01:37:05.626 --> 01:37:06.459
Which one?

01:37:06.626 --> 01:37:07.918
Rocinante.

01:37:08.959 --> 01:37:10.126
Rocinante.

01:37:10.501 --> 01:37:11.959
What a strange name.

01:37:12.251 --> 01:37:13.418
Do you like it?

01:37:13.834 --> 01:37:15.168
It's good for a horse.

01:37:16.126 --> 01:37:17.334
All right.

01:37:17.834 --> 01:37:19.793
You're more
handsome without the beard...

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:22.668
and my father's
clothes look good on you.

01:37:39.543 --> 01:37:41.376
Do you know
how to play chess?

01:37:41.543 --> 01:37:42.501
No.

01:37:42.834 --> 01:37:46.501
But I know how to move the
pieces and what they're called.

01:37:47.334 --> 01:37:49.084
The horse can jump,

01:37:49.251 --> 01:37:51.834
and the king,
since he's older,

01:37:52.001 --> 01:37:53.751
can only move one square at a time.

01:37:54.084 --> 01:37:55.584
Do you know
who taught you that?

01:37:56.251 --> 01:37:57.709
I don't remember.

01:37:58.876 --> 01:38:00.584
I've known it
since I was little,

01:38:00.751 --> 01:38:03.251
from when I lived in
Madrid with my daddy.

01:38:04.918 --> 01:38:06.043
With your daddy?

01:38:17.918 --> 01:38:19.334
I have to go now.

01:38:20.126 --> 01:38:22.084
But maybe we can see
each other another time.

01:38:22.251 --> 01:38:24.751
Yes. You could come
over and play with me.

01:38:26.293 --> 01:38:27.459
I promise.

01:38:29.543 --> 01:38:30.334
Goodbye, Margaux.

01:38:30.918 --> 01:38:32.084
Goodbye.

01:38:32.876 --> 01:38:34.209
Be nice to Mommy.

01:38:46.918 --> 01:38:49.918
I think I remember you.
