<i>Previously on "Another Period"...</i>

00:02.602 --> 00:04.741
You ordered a white heiress, right?

00:04.742 --> 00:05.806
Hello, little girl.

00:05.873 --> 00:08.571
Your sister's in quite a bit of trouble.

00:09.342 --> 00:12.360
<i>That's right, show daddy
how pretty your dress is.</i>

00:29.195 --> 00:31.392
I can't believe they
hacked Edison's server.

00:31.393 --> 00:33.432
What? Talbert, the butler?

00:33.433 --> 00:35.035
Yeah, hacked him to pieces with an axe.

00:35.036 --> 00:36.167
Step right up!

00:36.417 --> 00:38.420
A private film stolen

00:38.487 --> 00:42.557
from Edison Studios
is now available for viewing!

00:42.624 --> 00:44.193
I can't wait to see it!

00:44.473 --> 00:46.999
I can't wait to ejaculate
next to you in public.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.868
You've come for me!

00:53.935 --> 00:56.003
I knew sending daily press releases

00:56.070 --> 00:58.072
to every newspaper in town
would eventually pay off.

00:58.140 --> 00:59.240
Beatrice!

00:59.308 --> 01:00.776
Beatrice, you're a slut. Smile.

01:00.843 --> 01:02.010
- What?
- Beatrice, now,

01:02.076 --> 01:03.811
are you a regular slut or a nasty slut?

01:03.877 --> 01:05.281
Excuse me, my name's Lillian.

01:05.346 --> 01:06.981
Yes, Beatrice, following up,
I have a question:

01:07.049 --> 01:08.551
you're a whore.

01:08.617 --> 01:10.819
I'll rephrase it as a question:
You're a whore?

01:10.885 --> 01:12.388
- I'm not a whore!
- Beatrice,

01:12.454 --> 01:14.456
then why did you record the eroti-scope?

01:14.522 --> 01:15.232
What?

01:17.560 --> 01:20.060
I feel scared and confused,
so I'm gonna yell!

01:20.127 --> 01:21.996
- No, Beatrice! Beatrice!
- Beatrice!

01:22.064 --> 01:23.198
My sister can't comment right now,

01:23.265 --> 01:24.832
but feel free to ask me anything.

01:24.900 --> 01:26.201
Uh...

01:26.268 --> 01:28.436
- pack it up.
- Nothing to see.

01:28.502 --> 01:29.320
Hello?

01:30.072 --> 01:31.114
I'm a whore too!

01:42.242 --> 01:45.375
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:54.129 --> 01:55.564
Beatrice, look on the bright side.

01:55.630 --> 01:57.533
This could be great for me.

01:57.599 --> 01:59.014
How is this great for anybody?

01:59.015 --> 02:01.535
Because, people are finally
interested in the Bellacourts,

02:01.602 --> 02:03.871
so they'll be writing
about the one with star quality.

02:03.939 --> 02:05.180
That's moi.

02:05.863 --> 02:08.767
Sisters. The gossip rags have arrived.

02:08.768 --> 02:13.013
Ooh!

02:13.081 --> 02:15.215
I made the cover!

02:15.283 --> 02:17.152
"Golden-haired Beatrice Bellacourt

02:17.772 --> 02:19.054
with... passerby."

02:19.477 --> 02:21.390
Passerby?

02:21.457 --> 02:22.258
Oh, no.

02:23.125 --> 02:24.850
They're not writing about me at all.

02:25.693 --> 02:27.101
Oh, this is so stupid!

02:28.030 --> 02:31.205
Why does everyone care about dumb,
boring Beatrice having sex?

02:31.207 --> 02:32.835
People care about Beatrice

02:32.900 --> 02:34.435
because she made a statement.

02:34.437 --> 02:37.340
But... she was also humiliated
and a victim.

02:37.471 --> 02:40.208
She did it on purpose,
but she was also tricked.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.644
This is the worst thing
that's ever happened to me.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.045
No, this is the worst thing

02:44.112 --> 02:45.284
that's ever happened to me!

02:45.285 --> 02:46.915
Stop trying to make this all about you!

02:46.982 --> 02:48.268
But I'm the one in the film!

02:48.269 --> 02:51.018
Don't rub it in!

03:13.308 --> 03:15.177
What are you looking at?

03:15.243 --> 03:17.279
Are those damn newspapermen
still out there?

03:17.345 --> 03:18.845
No, we have new neighbors.

03:19.748 --> 03:22.517
Oh, God in heaven, they're Italian!

03:22.583 --> 03:24.838
Don't tell me those little
Caesars are moving in next door.

03:24.839 --> 03:25.903
We're gonna have to move to France.

03:25.904 --> 03:29.353
Those olive gardeners are gonna
drive down the value of this house.

03:29.355 --> 03:30.727
The sunlight is coming down

03:30.791 --> 03:32.260
on their black hair. It's blinding me!

03:32.327 --> 03:33.260
Oh, God.

03:33.327 --> 03:34.529
Gentlemen.

03:34.595 --> 03:36.196
A gift from your new neighbors.

03:36.263 --> 03:37.499
Olive oil? They might as well

03:37.565 --> 03:39.066
have sent us rat feces.

03:39.134 --> 03:41.432
They put it on their hair
to make it shimmer.

03:41.803 --> 03:43.371
It's how they hypnotize you at the fair.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.674
Peepers, pour that down
the toilet at once,

03:45.740 --> 03:47.375
and then set fire to the toilet.

03:47.441 --> 03:50.244
And then dump the ashes
on their yard to send a message.

03:50.311 --> 03:52.885
And then take a poop
on that pile of ashes.

03:53.815 --> 03:54.917
Close the door, please.

03:54.983 --> 03:56.042
Don't... not with your hands.

03:56.043 --> 03:57.464
You've touched the olive oil.
With your feet.

04:06.127 --> 04:08.429
Beatrice, what are you
doing on the floor?

04:08.496 --> 04:10.496
That's what the servants eat off of.

04:10.497 --> 04:13.001
Mother, everyone's saying I'm a whore.

04:13.068 --> 04:15.370
That is because you are a whore, dear.

04:15.436 --> 04:16.971
It was not my fault.

04:17.036 --> 04:20.074
I was kidnapped and forced
to have sex on camera.

04:20.141 --> 04:23.005
Nobody told you to get kidnapped!

04:23.466 --> 04:25.480
The only thing you can do now

04:25.547 --> 04:29.517
is make a public apology
for your filthy behavior.

04:29.583 --> 04:31.819
No, please.
Mother, that's so embarrassing.

04:31.886 --> 04:34.422
What's embarrassing is you,

04:34.489 --> 04:37.492
and your golden mane of temptation.

04:37.559 --> 04:39.094
Now, you go to your room

04:39.160 --> 04:41.029
and stop looking at me like that.

04:41.095 --> 04:42.530
Like what?

04:42.597 --> 04:45.756
Like you're just begging
to be kidnapped again.

04:50.286 --> 04:53.174
- Oh, work that head knot.
- Oh, that's it.

04:53.242 --> 04:54.176
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

04:54.242 --> 04:56.510
Ooh, top of the morning to ya,

04:56.578 --> 04:58.780
men and massage mavens.
Just so you know,

04:58.847 --> 05:01.016
we're looking into the hack
at Edison Studios.

05:01.083 --> 05:03.184
Right! Now, we think this is part

05:03.251 --> 05:05.886
of a much larger crime wave
here in Newport.

05:05.953 --> 05:08.590
What... Stop that, right now.

05:08.657 --> 05:10.358
- A crime wave in Newport?
- Aye.

05:10.424 --> 05:14.095
Not sure if you're aware of it,
but you got some new neighbors.

05:14.162 --> 05:15.931
Not sure what
they want to call themselves,

05:15.932 --> 05:18.933
but we've been calling 'em
"dark-eyed sardine slingers."

05:19.001 --> 05:20.368
I thought a good one

05:20.434 --> 05:21.975
was "Arabian whites."

05:21.976 --> 05:23.905
Cannoli fingerers!

05:23.972 --> 05:24.720
Catholics!

05:24.721 --> 05:26.340
- Hey, hey!
- Whoa, hey!

05:26.408 --> 05:28.443
You'll have to go
to confession for that!

05:28.509 --> 05:28.808
Sorry.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.933
Nothing wrong with foldin'
in the Mother Mary!

05:30.934 --> 05:32.064
Oh, Lord in heaven...

05:32.065 --> 05:33.753
now, how can we protect ourselves?

05:33.754 --> 05:35.760
Well, the police
are hiring people every day

05:35.761 --> 05:37.951
to deal with the crisis, so let me know

05:38.018 --> 05:39.187
if you know anyone interested.

05:40.722 --> 05:43.125
I have always dreamed
of putting on a uniform

05:43.191 --> 05:46.595
- and then dominating strangers.
- Plus, I am so bored.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.530
I haven't left the house in six years.

05:49.896 --> 05:51.498
- We'd like to join up.
- Yes.

05:51.566 --> 05:53.602
Oh. You look good enough.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.905
- I dub thee police!
- Oh!

05:56.970 --> 05:59.101
Wait, that's it? There's
no training or anything?

05:59.102 --> 06:03.177
Well, department had some cutbacks, so
training was the first thing to go.

06:03.244 --> 06:04.912
And training to be a cop's

06:04.980 --> 06:06.713
a bit like training for brain surgery:

06:06.780 --> 06:08.108
you don't need much of it.

06:08.109 --> 06:10.518
Just get in there
and start crackin' open skulls.

06:11.619 --> 06:12.534
And hey!

06:13.521 --> 06:14.734
Don't forget to have fun out there.

06:14.735 --> 06:17.358
Oh, let's get started, shall we?

06:18.727 --> 06:20.061
- Oh, no!
- How about you?

06:20.128 --> 06:21.763
I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding!

06:27.768 --> 06:30.754
This is all. Your. Fault!

06:31.172 --> 06:33.388
First, you got us caught
in that riverboat propeller,

06:33.389 --> 06:34.696
and now this.

06:35.309 --> 06:38.045
Everyone says
you're so blonde and beautiful,

06:38.112 --> 06:39.522
but I know the truth.

06:40.148 --> 06:42.047
You're evil.

06:42.449 --> 06:46.266
And without you, it's gonna be so
much easier to hold up my head!

07:03.887 --> 07:06.022
I don't care what the papers are saying.

07:06.090 --> 07:07.710
I'm supposed to be the famous one!

07:07.712 --> 07:09.989
I am not going to take this lying down.

07:10.829 --> 07:12.531
Oh. Or maybe I will.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.404
<i>Deadline, deadline, deadline.</i>

07:14.405 --> 07:15.806
- Deadline, deadline, deadline!
- Look at this.

07:15.874 --> 07:17.508
These serial numbers do not match.

07:17.576 --> 07:19.912
- Excuse me!
- Check your files, twice.

07:19.977 --> 07:21.458
I read your article

07:21.459 --> 07:25.116
about Beatrice Bellacourt.
And I'll have you know,

07:25.184 --> 07:26.619
you're barking up the wrong tree.

07:26.686 --> 07:28.721
It's her sister you
wanna be writing about.

07:28.787 --> 07:31.157
- Thank you for your help.
- Hortense Bellacourt?

07:31.222 --> 07:32.758
We write about her often.

07:32.825 --> 07:35.160
No, no, her other sister.
Her name's Lillian Bellacourt.

07:35.227 --> 07:37.029
- Who?
- Lillian Bellacourt.

07:37.095 --> 07:38.463
Okay.

07:38.530 --> 07:40.465
She's the type of person
the public would love to hate,

07:40.532 --> 07:42.318
and then just love.

07:42.319 --> 07:44.738
I've never heard of her. Now, is
she a whore, like her sister?

07:44.739 --> 07:45.731
That's what people wanna read about.

07:45.731 --> 07:46.729
Oh, yes, definitely.

07:46.730 --> 07:48.740
She's a huge whore. Big, big whore.

07:48.807 --> 07:50.775
Much bigger whore
than Beatrice Bellacourt.

07:50.842 --> 07:52.811
In fact, I have on good word

07:52.878 --> 07:55.648
that Lillian Bellacourt
was recently put in the hospital

07:55.713 --> 08:00.851
because... her stomach
was so full of... you-know-what.

08:02.435 --> 08:04.590
- They had to pump it.
- Yes, I know, I'm sure.

08:04.657 --> 08:07.893
We've heard this before, madam.
It was Susan B. Anthony,

08:07.960 --> 08:09.361
wasn't it? And who before?

08:09.427 --> 08:11.029
I believe it was Sojourner Truth?

08:11.095 --> 08:12.997
- Sojourner Truth!
- And then,

08:13.064 --> 08:14.848
before that, Martha Washington.

08:14.849 --> 08:16.167
- Martha Washington.
- Please,

08:16.234 --> 08:17.669
you have to listen to me.

08:17.736 --> 08:19.571
Ma'am, we are the media.
We deliver facts.

08:19.638 --> 08:22.241
Please be gone.
Your rumors are not needed here.

08:22.307 --> 08:23.853
Well, this time it's true!

08:23.855 --> 08:25.797
Unless you can do a surgery in public

08:25.798 --> 08:27.078
- that proves this is true...
- Oh!

08:27.145 --> 08:28.413
- We're not interested.
- There is!

08:28.480 --> 08:30.348
There's a public surgery.

08:30.415 --> 08:31.684
Live surgery!

08:31.750 --> 08:33.953
She's going to get her stomach pumped.

08:34.020 --> 08:37.414
- A live surgery?
- Yes, a live surgery.

08:37.477 --> 08:41.601
Bellacourt Manor, live surgery,
stomach-pumping male ejaculate.

08:41.602 --> 08:43.193
We're gonna measure those pints.

08:43.260 --> 08:46.372
Thank you so much. If there is a
live surgery, we will be there.

08:46.374 --> 08:47.467
All right, well, tata.

08:47.531 --> 08:48.800
Thank you for the tip, Lillian.

08:48.867 --> 08:50.001
- Thank you so much.
- Oh, I'm not Lillian.

08:50.068 --> 08:51.502
I'm just a concerned citizen.

08:51.569 --> 08:52.737
- Right, okay.
- Oh, yes, of course.

08:52.804 --> 08:53.838
- Concerned...
- I'm from Alabama.

08:53.905 --> 08:55.840
Concerned Southern citizen... whore.

09:01.512 --> 09:03.681
Mother? I did what you asked.

09:03.748 --> 09:07.146
Now nobody will kidnap me. Oh, sit down!

09:07.652 --> 09:09.253
What have you done?

09:09.320 --> 09:12.723
You can't go to your
interview looking like that!

09:12.790 --> 09:14.392
Her hair won't lay properly, madam.

09:14.459 --> 09:15.927
Maybe a kicky hat.

09:15.993 --> 09:17.461
Oh, don't be grotesque, Peepers.

09:17.529 --> 09:19.198
Women aren't wearing hats this year.

09:19.264 --> 09:21.099
I hesitate to even suggest it, madam.

09:21.165 --> 09:23.968
But... maybe we should try
the "Eye-talian" way.

09:24.035 --> 09:26.070
Forcing ourselves on our spouses?

09:26.137 --> 09:27.409
No!

09:28.305 --> 09:29.275
Olive oil.

09:31.709 --> 09:32.710
Oh...

09:42.887 --> 09:43.988
How do I look?

09:50.629 --> 09:51.878
Whoa there, tot.

09:52.496 --> 09:53.698
Why aren't you in school?

09:53.766 --> 09:55.835
I'm headed to work at the night factory.

09:56.602 --> 09:57.803
All right. Have a good day.

09:58.119 --> 09:58.878
Carry on.

10:00.238 --> 10:03.040
Excuse me, sir.
Are you sleeping on the street?

10:03.107 --> 10:06.111
No, I just took some heroin
and I'm nodding off.

10:06.178 --> 10:07.813
- It's not a crime.
- Well, that's true.

10:08.881 --> 10:11.217
Oh, oh! Say, excuse me, sir!

10:11.283 --> 10:13.351
Sir! Is this woman bothering you?

10:13.418 --> 10:15.450
It's okay, she's my wife.

10:15.853 --> 10:17.555
She smiled at a dog, and there's just

10:17.622 --> 10:19.455
something about that I don't like.

10:19.658 --> 10:21.159
Well, just don't kill her.

10:23.062 --> 10:23.995
Come on, you!

10:24.062 --> 10:25.196
I'm so frustrated.

10:25.262 --> 10:26.931
All we've seen is a truant orphan,

10:26.998 --> 10:29.066
and a junkie, and a man
disciplining his wife.

10:29.134 --> 10:31.459
- I mean, where are the crimes?
- You know why

10:31.460 --> 10:32.871
we haven't seen any actual crimes.

10:32.938 --> 10:34.640
Why, because everything's
basically legal?

10:34.707 --> 10:37.476
No, we need to go to the source.

10:37.543 --> 10:40.603
We need to investigate the people
who actually committed the hack.

10:40.604 --> 10:43.261
Well, but we don't know
for sure it was the Italians.

10:43.542 --> 10:46.565
Albert, police work is not
about evidence.

10:46.566 --> 10:48.082
It's about instincts.

10:48.441 --> 10:51.230
And my instincts tell me
that we need to go

10:51.231 --> 10:54.287
to Greece Town
and get us some "Eye-talians."

10:57.330 --> 10:59.069
So, you want me to perform a surgery?

10:59.070 --> 11:01.239
Yes, doctor, I need your help.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.857
The newspapers are going to be there.

11:02.858 --> 11:03.896
Everyone will be watching.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.053
The problem is, I'm...

11:06.466 --> 11:08.167
I'm not the kind of
doctor you think I am.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.678
Oh, no, it's okay.
I know you're a bad doctor.

11:09.679 --> 11:10.911
No, I'm not...

11:13.361 --> 11:15.008
I'm not a medical doctor.

11:15.009 --> 11:17.742
My masters is in medicine,
but my doctorate...

11:17.743 --> 11:19.245
is in the theater arts!

11:19.921 --> 11:20.902
The long and short of it is,

11:20.903 --> 11:23.415
I'm not qualified to conduct surgeries.

11:23.540 --> 11:25.600
Well, I don't really have
two pints of ejaculatory fluid

11:25.601 --> 11:26.814
in my stomach, so...

11:27.080 --> 11:29.170
all we have to do is stage the surgery!

11:31.304 --> 11:32.830
Did you say "stage"?

11:36.687 --> 11:38.608
Phillip, extra phosphorous.

11:39.143 --> 11:41.621
We're competing with
that orphanage fire story.

11:41.959 --> 11:45.799
Beatrice, thank you so much
for granting me this interview.

11:46.397 --> 11:48.522
Now, how does it feel to be the star

11:48.523 --> 11:51.419
of the... the highest-grossing
film of all time?

11:51.420 --> 11:56.684
There are reports
that "The Wizard of Ahhs"

11:56.685 --> 12:01.283
has grossed up to 1.2 hundred dollars.

12:01.706 --> 12:05.244
People are making money off of this?

12:06.009 --> 12:07.894
Beatrice, what do you have to say?

12:09.839 --> 12:10.773
Just that...

12:12.102 --> 12:13.136
I made a mistake.

12:13.756 --> 12:16.983
And sadly, that mistake was
something the whole world saw.

12:17.155 --> 12:20.041
But, I'm hoping that people
can find it in their hearts to...

12:21.323 --> 12:22.969
see me for who I am,

12:23.047 --> 12:25.406
and not the biggest mistake I ever made.

12:27.349 --> 12:29.735
I wanna commend you on your honesty,

12:29.736 --> 12:33.229
and your brave new hairstyle.

12:33.230 --> 12:36.277
Now, is that a statement
on the duality of women

12:36.345 --> 12:37.801
in a patriarchal society?

12:38.372 --> 12:38.999
No.

12:39.299 --> 12:41.690
Well, get a tintype, boys,
'cause I predict, by the spring,

12:41.691 --> 12:43.915
every woman's gonna
have their hair styled

12:43.916 --> 12:45.521
in "the Beatrice"!

12:47.644 --> 12:50.787
Hold it for three more minutes.

12:51.897 --> 12:53.507
180 Mississippi.

12:54.650 --> 12:56.528
179 Mississippi.

12:57.434 --> 12:59.424
178 Mississippi.

13:02.238 --> 13:05.342
Behold, the whore of Newport.

13:05.409 --> 13:08.511
The daughter of Babylon,
the harlot of the harbor,

13:08.578 --> 13:10.213
the Jezebel of the ball.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.175
The patient...

13:11.582 --> 13:15.095
shows all of the signs of the whore.

13:15.619 --> 13:19.757
Syphilis, genital slack, sarcasm,

13:19.823 --> 13:23.411
the anchovy odor
of a woman of the night.

13:24.328 --> 13:27.731
Today, I shall perform
a dangerous proto-zectomy,

13:27.798 --> 13:29.878
removing from the patient's gullet

13:30.134 --> 13:32.690
nearly a gallon of semenical fluid.

13:33.169 --> 13:36.039
Many of you have heard the urban legend

13:36.106 --> 13:38.360
of the woman in such a predicament.

13:38.742 --> 13:39.142
Ow.

13:39.651 --> 13:40.507
Behold.

13:41.312 --> 13:42.571
The whore is real.

13:45.616 --> 13:47.251
♪ And a two, and a three ♪

13:47.318 --> 13:48.485
Wait, is that real ether?

13:48.552 --> 13:50.288
- It has to be...
- Look over there.

13:50.353 --> 13:51.688
What?

13:51.755 --> 13:54.192
And in these moments
between life and death,

13:54.257 --> 13:57.628
fellows... let us begin.

13:57.696 --> 14:00.064
We're gonna get
the Pulitzer for this one.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.529
I'm salivating just thinking about it.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.840
And all the woods of Russia,

14:05.536 --> 14:10.407
are trembling under
the blows of the axe.

14:14.444 --> 14:15.445
Thank you.

14:15.512 --> 14:17.614
That was Doctor Astrov's monologue

14:17.682 --> 14:20.318
from Anton Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya."

14:20.385 --> 14:22.218
And now for a soliloquy from one of

14:22.285 --> 14:24.354
Shakespeare's least beloved plays,

14:24.422 --> 14:25.790
"Coriolanus."

14:25.856 --> 14:27.025
- No...
- What's happening?

14:27.092 --> 14:28.292
Wait just a moment, just...

14:28.358 --> 14:30.760
My name is Caius Martius, who hath...

14:30.827 --> 14:32.063
- What's going on?
- It looks like someone needs

14:32.129 --> 14:33.565
a bit more ether alcohol
before we continue.

14:33.630 --> 14:34.999
No! Not ether.

14:35.066 --> 14:36.133
Just wait a moment...

14:46.709 --> 14:47.978
Stop it! Stop it!

14:49.712 --> 14:50.948
Oh, bah!

14:51.015 --> 14:52.516
What's happening?

14:52.583 --> 14:55.585
This is not ejaculate! It's milk!

14:55.653 --> 14:57.910
Lillian Bellacourt is a liar,

14:57.911 --> 15:00.256
- not a whore.
- And that monologue

15:00.323 --> 15:03.993
was absolutely incredible!
I did love that monologue.

15:04.060 --> 15:06.029
- Yes.
- He's talented.

15:06.097 --> 15:07.030
He's good.

15:12.702 --> 15:15.305
First, they besmirch
the Bellacourt name,

15:15.371 --> 15:17.842
now they have the nerve
to profit off of it?

15:17.909 --> 15:19.809
Well, it doesn't seem
like that much money.

15:19.876 --> 15:21.811
You spent $100,000 on your own cloud

15:21.879 --> 15:23.045
and we couldn't even find it.

15:23.046 --> 15:25.882
It was $300,000,
but that's not the point.

15:25.949 --> 15:28.184
You are the one who was kidnapped.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.553
You're the one who fornicated.

15:30.621 --> 15:32.991
I'm the one who should
be making money off of it.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.292
What if I had sex
with someone else on camera,

15:35.358 --> 15:36.727
and that someone else was Frederick?

15:36.794 --> 15:38.295
I'm not asking for your opinion.

15:38.362 --> 15:41.064
You've no talent, no discernible skills.

15:41.131 --> 15:43.400
It's a miracle you're
even able to breathe!

15:43.467 --> 15:44.769
No, I can do it!

15:48.105 --> 15:50.908
Two blocks away from the abortionist

15:50.975 --> 15:53.244
when I went into labor.

15:53.310 --> 15:53.957
Hey!

15:55.078 --> 15:57.747
What if we sold a product
with my face on it?

15:57.814 --> 16:00.150
Products don't have celebrities on them.

16:00.217 --> 16:02.745
That's what caricatures
of black people are for.

16:02.746 --> 16:05.323
Well, it seems like we have two ideas:

16:05.389 --> 16:08.501
sell a product, or for me to
have sex with Frederick on film.

16:09.393 --> 16:10.496
Okay, I'll do it.

16:12.929 --> 16:14.832
You know something, Beatrice?

16:15.918 --> 16:17.352
Your hair...

16:18.202 --> 16:20.904
really does look magnificent.

16:29.980 --> 16:31.683
Can we just barge in there?

16:31.749 --> 16:33.739
We haven't seen anything illegal yet.

16:34.221 --> 16:36.365
We can tell them
to turn their music down.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.621
Ah, yes! If you can even call it music.

16:38.688 --> 16:40.256
Opera's supposed to be German.

16:40.323 --> 16:41.659
Can't argue with that. Let's go!

16:42.760 --> 16:44.352
- Hello!
- Police!

16:44.809 --> 16:46.431
Hello, we're in your home!

16:46.496 --> 16:48.064
Not again-a.

16:48.131 --> 16:49.866
How can we help you, officers?

16:49.933 --> 16:52.432
All right, sir, I'm gonna
ask you to lower your voice.

16:52.433 --> 16:54.203
- Please.
- What is this, what is this?

16:54.270 --> 16:55.271
What's in here? What is in here?

16:55.338 --> 16:56.506
- Wine.
- Wine.

16:56.573 --> 16:57.542
- Vino.
- Oh, yeah, right.

16:57.608 --> 16:58.842
I'm not sure about that.

16:58.909 --> 17:00.076
- What's this?
- A plate, a simple plate.

17:00.143 --> 17:01.210
- Yeah? What's going on?
- A napkin.

17:01.277 --> 17:02.579
- What do you got here?
- Salad.

17:02.646 --> 17:03.815
What's this... what about all of this?

17:03.881 --> 17:06.215
- It's a couch!
- It's an English thing.

17:06.282 --> 17:07.717
Hey, hey, she's got something
under her dress, there.

17:07.784 --> 17:09.252
Hold on, hold on, Albert.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.821
I think she's just a big fat woman.

17:10.887 --> 17:12.957
No, I'm not fat! I'm pregnant.

17:13.022 --> 17:14.291
It's a baby in here.

17:14.358 --> 17:16.127
Oh, great, the Italians are multiplying.

17:16.194 --> 17:17.124
They could take our jobs.

17:17.125 --> 17:18.263
It's a bambino!

17:18.265 --> 17:19.896
- Oh, she's got a bomb!
- She's got a bomb.

17:19.964 --> 17:21.397
- She's got a bomb!
- No, a child!

17:21.464 --> 17:22.566
A child!

17:22.632 --> 17:24.034
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am! Calm down!

17:24.101 --> 17:26.569
Everyone, calm down!
Everyone, calm down!

17:26.982 --> 17:28.438
All right, hands up! That's it!

17:28.505 --> 17:30.507
Excuse me, sir, what
is that in your hand?

17:30.573 --> 17:31.842
- It's a spoon, I...
- That's what I thought.

17:31.909 --> 17:33.043
- All right.
- Not again.

17:33.110 --> 17:34.044
I'm gonna have to pat you down!

17:34.111 --> 17:35.312
No, no, please! No.

17:35.379 --> 17:37.113
Giuseppe, completely submit to him.

17:37.180 --> 17:38.748
He's got a condition.

17:38.815 --> 17:39.850
Oh, he's so ticklish.

17:39.917 --> 17:41.651
Please-a, he can't be tickled.

17:41.718 --> 17:43.153
Look at him!

17:43.220 --> 17:44.955
He's laughing and laughing and laughing.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.189
Albert!

17:46.256 --> 17:48.175
- I got something here.
- What's up?

17:48.758 --> 17:50.087
Let me see about that.

17:56.900 --> 17:58.201
This is delicious!

18:00.271 --> 18:01.438
All things considered,
good food, good food.

18:01.505 --> 18:03.974
Yeah, sit, sit.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.609
All right, well, cheers, everyone.

18:05.676 --> 18:06.810
It's really nice to meet you.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.779
- To America!
- To America!

18:10.380 --> 18:12.352
You silly-billy.

18:12.664 --> 18:14.785
This is my first opportunity

18:14.852 --> 18:16.652
<i>to make money on my own:</i>

18:16.719 --> 18:21.290
profiting off of the sexual
exploitation of my daughter.

18:21.358 --> 18:22.693
I thought you could only use sex

18:22.759 --> 18:24.827
to get attention from men.
I never realized

18:24.894 --> 18:27.163
you could use sex
to get rich and famous!

18:27.230 --> 18:28.665
<i>All this time, I was worried about</i>

18:28.732 --> 18:31.193
<i>not being interesting
or talented or smart,</i>

18:31.736 --> 18:34.271
but it turns out, I had
everything I needed

18:34.338 --> 18:36.741
all along... this!

18:39.476 --> 18:42.013
Hello, everyone. Welcome to the launch

18:42.079 --> 18:44.748
of the Beatrice Bellacourt
Feminine Hair Lubricant.

18:47.819 --> 18:51.155
Look how ugly this servant was
before she used my product.

18:51.220 --> 18:53.110
And look how pretty she is now.

18:56.192 --> 18:57.694
Those are two different people.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.668
Exactly.

18:59.228 --> 19:00.197
Thank you.

19:00.263 --> 19:01.332
Since being a whore

19:01.398 --> 19:02.799
didn't get me any press coverage,

19:02.865 --> 19:04.301
the only way to get their attention

19:04.368 --> 19:07.116
will be to do something... illegal.

19:09.285 --> 19:12.205
<i>Soon, everyone will be talking
about Lillian Bellacourt.</i>

19:14.410 --> 19:15.845
Oh, my God.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.851
Is that... is... is that...

19:20.918 --> 19:22.453
Oh, my God.

19:22.518 --> 19:25.955
I cannot bring myself to say what I see.

19:26.023 --> 19:27.323
It's... it's...

19:27.390 --> 19:29.293
It's a woman...

19:29.360 --> 19:31.795
Wearing pants!

19:35.966 --> 19:37.734
Mm, what a scandal, right?

19:37.801 --> 19:40.204
- What a perversion.
- Lillian!

19:40.271 --> 19:42.206
So, what are you gonna
write about me in the press?

19:42.272 --> 19:43.627
We have journalistic standards.

19:43.628 --> 19:45.305
We are not writing about this!

19:45.306 --> 19:46.893
We have to draw the line somewhere.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.643
What, so you'll... so you'll write about

19:48.644 --> 19:51.714
a woman having sex on film
or a woman having ejaculate

19:51.782 --> 19:52.916
pumped from her stomach,

19:52.983 --> 19:54.251
and this is where you draw the line?

19:54.317 --> 19:57.520
Yes, this is absolutely disgusting!

19:59.523 --> 20:02.326
What is wrong with me?
Why won't anyone write about me?

20:02.392 --> 20:03.994
Beatrice is a vacant, useless whore,

20:04.061 --> 20:05.389
and that's all she'll ever be!

20:05.390 --> 20:07.197
Actually, you're wrong, Lillian.

20:07.264 --> 20:09.734
Whores are over.
I'm a businesswoman now.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.101
A businesswoman?!

20:11.168 --> 20:12.837
Oh, that's worse than being a whore!

20:12.902 --> 20:15.605
You're just jealous because I'm a star

20:15.671 --> 20:16.739
and you're not.

20:21.524 --> 20:23.713
As I was saying, if you want your wife

20:23.781 --> 20:25.849
to look like me, there's
only one way to do it.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.499
It's with the hair lubricant.

20:32.055 --> 20:34.858
Beatrice! How could you do this to me?

20:35.290 --> 20:37.483
I'm the one who's supposed
to have a product!

20:37.484 --> 20:40.663
I'm the one who's supposed
to have a lifestyle brand!

20:42.865 --> 20:44.067
When they brought out the cannoli?

20:44.134 --> 20:45.468
- Oh, that was so good!
- Oh, my God.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.603
- It tasted...
- And the tomato sauce...

20:46.669 --> 20:47.970
- Shh.
- What?

20:48.037 --> 20:50.039
- It's Lillian.
- What... she's wearing pants!

20:50.107 --> 20:53.029
We get to make an arrest.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.582
Let's do it!

20:57.648 --> 20:59.984
<i>- This is so rewarding!
- I feel so alive.</i>
