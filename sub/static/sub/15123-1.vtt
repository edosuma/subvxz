WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:06.607
Welcome back.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.042
Did everybody have
a great summer?

00:08.109 --> 00:10.144
(barking and applause)

00:10.211 --> 00:11.479
Well, I feel I should mention

00:11.545 --> 00:13.114
we lost one
of our favorite seniors.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.583
Sherwood. He used
to start each day

00:15.649 --> 00:18.219
with a song that perfectly
recapped what was going on.

00:18.286 --> 00:20.088
So, in his honor,

00:20.154 --> 00:22.056
I'd like to sing a song
about each one of you.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.824
Let's start with, um...

00:23.891 --> 00:25.559
with Hope.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.961
* Hope's father didn't have
much going on *

00:28.028 --> 00:30.498
* Living with his parents,
mowing some lawns *

00:30.564 --> 00:32.933
* His life was going
nowhere fast *

00:33.000 --> 00:35.836
* One night he met a lady
and they had a good time *

00:35.903 --> 00:37.738
* Till he learned she was a
killer, the serial kind *

00:37.805 --> 00:41.109
* And the cops,
they fried her ass *

00:41.175 --> 00:44.612
* But before they did,
she birthed him a kid *

00:44.678 --> 00:48.416
* And Jimmy found
a purpose in the world *

00:48.482 --> 00:52.953
* Though he doesn't have a clue,
he somehow manages to *

00:53.020 --> 00:54.955
* Raise a perfect little girl *

00:55.022 --> 00:56.757
* Some kids have all the love *

00:56.824 --> 00:58.926
* A great dad
and if that wasn't enough *

00:58.992 --> 01:02.363
* Hope's got a gang
who loves her greatly *

01:02.430 --> 01:04.265
* Grandma Virginia,
sarcastic and funny *

01:04.332 --> 01:06.634
* Grandpa Burt skims
pools for money *

01:06.700 --> 01:10.138
* And Maw Maw,
she's just crazy *

01:10.204 --> 01:11.639
* Hope's life wouldn't
be complete-a *

01:11.705 --> 01:12.973
* Without Jimmy's friend
Sabrina *

01:13.040 --> 01:16.310
* Who Jimmy loves
but hasn't told her so *

01:16.377 --> 01:19.413
* Although, come on,
she's got to know *

01:19.480 --> 01:21.081
* You might think
I am a dreamer *

01:21.149 --> 01:23.284
* But you'll understand
just when you meet her *

01:23.351 --> 01:26.587
* Why everyone loves
our little Hope *

01:26.654 --> 01:28.556
* And since we last saw her *

01:28.622 --> 01:30.658
* She's gotten bigger,
stronger, smarter *

01:30.724 --> 01:33.261
* She feeds herself and walks
and can say "No" *

01:33.327 --> 01:35.796
* These few months,
we sure have missed her *

01:35.863 --> 01:37.798
* But we welcome back
our day care sister *

01:37.865 --> 01:40.201
* Welcome back to Hope *

01:40.268 --> 01:43.171
* Welcome back
to Hope. *

01:43.237 --> 01:45.706
(laughing)

01:47.074 --> 01:48.942
* Whoo! *

01:49.009 --> 01:53.481
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:55.383 --> 01:56.750
See that guy?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.719
That's Daddy when
he was 13.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.954
I just drew a superhero.

02:01.021 --> 02:03.123
I'm going to put it on a T-shirt
and then...

02:03.191 --> 02:06.760
BURT: Bird in the house!
Bird in the house!
(bird cawing)

02:08.429 --> 02:11.865
Get ready. Here it comes.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.001
Yes!

02:14.067 --> 02:16.437
I don't remember
this exactly, but...

02:16.504 --> 02:18.906
Seems like a pretty average
day from my childhood.

02:22.243 --> 02:24.278
It kind of tickles.

02:24.345 --> 02:27.415
Wait, no, it doesn't.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.685
It's pecking!
It's pecking!

02:31.752 --> 02:32.720
(groans)

02:32.786 --> 02:34.255
It's pecking!

02:34.322 --> 02:36.690
2011, and still no jet packs.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.992
I feel like I should
write a letter to somebody.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.394
What you watching?

02:40.461 --> 02:41.895
I'm just showing Hope
some home movies

02:41.962 --> 02:44.698
of me as a kid.

02:44.765 --> 02:48.302
(playing intro to
"Hard to Handle")

02:48.369 --> 02:52.039
Whoa, hey. Wh-What's that?

02:52.105 --> 02:53.707
Hey, I'm
playing the piano.

02:53.774 --> 02:55.609
I used to be able
to play the piano?

02:55.676 --> 02:58.746
(laughing) No, you're
not really...

02:58.812 --> 03:00.147
That is so funny.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.650
You really don't remember?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.586
Before it broke, that piano was
the kind that could play itself.

03:05.653 --> 03:07.087
So you're just faking it.

03:07.154 --> 03:08.389
That's wild.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.757
Look at Daddy, Hope.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.425
Daddy's funny.

03:11.492 --> 03:13.327
* Baby, here I am *

03:13.394 --> 03:15.128
* I'm the man on the scene *

03:15.195 --> 03:17.831
* I can give you
what you want *

03:17.898 --> 03:20.901
* But you got to come home
with me *

03:20.968 --> 03:23.237
* I have got some
good ol' lovin' *

03:23.304 --> 03:25.539
* And I got some more
in store *

03:25.606 --> 03:28.309
* When I get through
throwin' it on you *

03:28.376 --> 03:30.344
* You gotta come back for more *

03:30.411 --> 03:32.280
* Boys are things that come
by the dozen *

03:32.346 --> 03:35.215
* But that ain't nothin'
but drugstore lovin' *

03:35.283 --> 03:37.451
* Hey, little thing,
let me light your candle *

03:37.518 --> 03:41.255
* 'Cause mama, I'm sure hard
to handle now, gets around... *

03:41.322 --> 03:44.925
Okay, fine.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.727
At one point
in your life

03:46.794 --> 03:52.700
you might have been a little...
amazingly talented.

03:52.766 --> 03:56.904
When you were 13, Maw Maw
decided to teach you piano.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.239
A music career

03:59.307 --> 04:00.741
may be his only ticket

04:00.808 --> 04:02.209
to get us out
of this hell hole.

04:02.276 --> 04:04.878
Unless you think he's smart
enough to go to college.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.116
VIRGINIA: Maw Maw hated
yelling at you,

04:09.182 --> 04:10.618
so she started teaching
with a partner.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.119
I'm sorry, Maw Maw...

04:12.185 --> 04:13.854
Oh, no, don't apologize
to me.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.657
It's Mr. Jingles who gets angry.
(deep voice): A-Flat minor!

04:16.724 --> 04:19.860
I wanted you to play an A.
If I wanted A-Flat minor,

04:19.927 --> 04:22.262
I'd have you go play
with your girlfriend's chest.

04:24.665 --> 04:28.302
Her methods were unorthodox,
but she got results.

04:28.369 --> 04:31.238
(playing riff)
Before we knew it,

04:31.305 --> 04:34.475
you were playing right along
with your father.

04:36.043 --> 04:39.413
(playing "Hard to Handle")

04:39.480 --> 04:41.549
(playing complex boogie-woogie)

04:47.020 --> 04:50.023
I couldn't believe it.

04:50.090 --> 04:53.193
After 13 years of watching you
underachieve

04:53.260 --> 04:56.564
at almost everything,
I was finally realizing

04:56.630 --> 04:58.966
that I gave birth
to a genius--

04:59.032 --> 05:01.068
a musical genius.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.371
I was so proud to show you off,

05:03.437 --> 05:05.473
I got you a spot in the
Natesville Music Academy's

05:05.539 --> 05:07.708
annual recital.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.511
* Actions speak louder
than words *

05:10.578 --> 05:13.614
* And I'm a man of great
experience *

05:13.681 --> 05:15.716
* I know you got you
another man *

05:15.783 --> 05:17.418
* But I can love you
better than him *

05:17.485 --> 05:19.553
* Take my hand... *

05:19.620 --> 05:21.555
That night, all the teenage
girls in the audience

05:21.622 --> 05:24.725
got a bad case of Jimmy fever.

05:24.792 --> 05:25.959
* I'm advertising
love for free *

05:26.026 --> 05:28.796
* So you can place
your ad with me *

05:28.862 --> 05:30.764
* Boys are things that
come by the dozen *

05:30.831 --> 05:33.066
* But that ain't nothing
but drugstore lovin' *

05:33.133 --> 05:36.169
* 'Cause hey, little thing,
let me light your candle *

05:36.236 --> 05:38.906
* 'Cause mama, I'm sure hard to
handle now, gets around... *

05:38.972 --> 05:41.341
And I admit it--
being the mother

05:41.409 --> 05:43.076
of a genius was addicting.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.679
Wherever we went,
I just loved to show you off.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.214
The sun's really
shining today, isn't it?

05:47.280 --> 05:50.183
You want to see a son shining?

05:50.250 --> 05:51.985
You should see
my son shine.

05:52.052 --> 05:52.820
Jimmy, come here.

05:52.886 --> 05:53.821
Sing that song
from the radio.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.323
You know, Mama's favorite.

05:56.390 --> 05:59.159
* She doesn't own a dress *

05:59.226 --> 06:00.994
* Her hair is always a mess *

06:01.061 --> 06:04.331
* If you catch her stealing,
she won't confess *

06:04.398 --> 06:05.766
* She's beautiful *

06:05.833 --> 06:08.001
* Smokes a pack a day *

06:08.068 --> 06:10.337
* Wait, that's me,
but anyway *

06:10.404 --> 06:12.540
* Meet Virginia. *

06:12.606 --> 06:15.142
That's me-- Virginia.
Mom of a genius.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.377
(laughing)
Shh!

06:17.445 --> 06:19.713
Stop that.
Shut up.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.583
Go ahead, keep singing, honey.
They're just jealous.

06:24.785 --> 06:29.423
* Well, she wants
to be the queen *

06:29.490 --> 06:31.158
* And she thinks... *
(thud)

06:33.661 --> 06:36.029
You greasy-haired little turds!

06:37.798 --> 06:40.801
When you came to, you
didn't know where you were

06:40.868 --> 06:43.604
or how to play piano
or sing or anything

06:43.671 --> 06:44.938
from the last eight months.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.073
You had ambrosia.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.975
Anemia.
Anemia.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.544
But singing and playing
music is a talent.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.880
I'm sure it has to be
in here somewhere.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.418
(playing random notes)
This is killing me.

06:58.486 --> 07:01.722
He had so much talent,
and I squandered it.

07:01.789 --> 07:05.693
He could have been an
international superstar.

07:05.759 --> 07:09.797
Like David Hasselhoff,
or Hello Kitty.

07:09.863 --> 07:12.132
(off-key):
* Meet Virginia *

07:12.199 --> 07:14.968
Ugh!
* I can't wait to... *

07:15.035 --> 07:17.237
Jimmy, for the love
of God, stop it!

07:17.304 --> 07:19.206
You're killing your mother!

07:24.612 --> 07:26.179
I don't know what's
harder to believe--

07:26.246 --> 07:28.516
that that's you, or that
you haven't changed your
hair in ten years.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.083
You stick with what works.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.786
It's too bad you can't play
like this anymore, because...

07:32.853 --> 07:37.090
* Baby, here I am,
I'm the man on the scene *

07:37.157 --> 07:39.226
* I can give you what you want *
Whoa.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.460
* But you got to come home
with me *

07:40.528 --> 07:42.362
(sighing)

07:42.429 --> 07:45.098
* I have got some
good ol' lovin' *

07:45.165 --> 07:47.668
* And I got some more
in store... *

07:47.735 --> 07:49.570
(playing random notes)

07:49.637 --> 07:52.172
For God's sake, Jimmy,

07:52.239 --> 07:54.642
please just give up!

07:56.043 --> 07:57.778
You should have seen
Sabrina today.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.412
She's never looked
at the real me

07:59.479 --> 08:01.448
the way she looked
at the me on the tape.

08:01.515 --> 08:02.716
Of course not, honey.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.184
The you on that tape

08:04.251 --> 08:07.688
had talent and charisma,
but that's gone.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.422
I feel terrible,

08:09.489 --> 08:10.524
but we tried everything.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.861
And there was just
no bringing it back.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.863
Maybe we should
try again.

08:15.929 --> 08:16.897
Uh, what kind of stuff
did you do?

08:16.964 --> 08:18.732
What did the
doctor suggest?

08:22.836 --> 08:25.305
Don't tell me you didn't
take me to a doctor.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.274
I got nailed in the head
with a golf club.

08:27.340 --> 08:28.609
It was a putter.

08:28.676 --> 08:30.077
We didn't have insurance.

08:30.143 --> 08:33.480
But we gave you bed rest
and we prayed.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.149
And then we gave you
every single thing
in the medicine cabinet.

08:36.216 --> 08:40.654
Of course, then you got severe
dizziness and stomach cramps.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.823
You were kind
of a delicate flower.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.592
And I haven't been able
to remember anything

08:44.658 --> 08:48.261
and I haven't been able to play
the piano or sing ever since.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.396
That's fascinating,

08:49.462 --> 08:50.798
because when you guys
walked in here

08:50.864 --> 08:53.366
I thought for sure you were
looking for oxycontin.

08:53.433 --> 08:56.136
Hey, settle this
argument for us.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.071
If he got hit on the head and
lost eight months of memory,

08:58.138 --> 09:00.574
doesn't it make sense that if he
got hit on the head again

09:00.641 --> 09:02.242
he'd get it back?

09:02.309 --> 09:03.811
Oh, you mean like
when Gilligan got amnesia

09:03.877 --> 09:06.146
when the Skipper hit him
with the board,

09:06.213 --> 09:08.682
and then later in the episode
he got his memory back when he

09:08.749 --> 09:09.883
got hit in the head
with a coconut?

09:09.950 --> 09:11.251
Yes. See, doctor's
with me on this.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.153
No, I wasn't agreeing with you,
I was just...

09:13.220 --> 09:17.390
No. Hitting him with a coconut
won't work. Don't do that.

09:17.457 --> 09:21.028
In other words, we
shouldn't take medical
advice from Gilligan?

09:21.094 --> 09:22.095
It wasn't Gilligan's idea.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.464
There was a professor
on that island.

09:24.531 --> 09:25.633
Professor.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.568
It's dangerous to get medical
advice from a TV comedy.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.071
They tend to make up whatever
medical stuff they want as long

09:31.138 --> 09:33.707
as it makes the story work.
The truth is,

09:33.774 --> 09:35.976
the therapy that seems to
trigger the most recall

09:36.043 --> 09:38.578
is recreating the events
that were forgotten.

09:38.646 --> 09:41.048
Recreating?
Muscle memory.

09:41.114 --> 09:44.051
Sights, or even smells
can unlock the lost memories.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.854
And once they're unlocked,
it's like they were never gone.

09:49.556 --> 09:51.324
(piano playing off-key)

09:51.391 --> 09:52.392
Ow.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.227
That sounds like crap.

09:54.294 --> 09:58.531
You're clumsier with these keys
than a janitor with Parkinson's.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.933
Ow!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.935
Mr. Jingles
never liked him.

10:06.106 --> 10:07.741
JIMMY: Everyone was
excited about the idea

10:07.808 --> 10:09.342
of me playing the piano again.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.344
Maw Maw was looking forward
to teaching me.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.146
I was anxious to play
for Sabrina.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.916
And Mom was looking forward
to showing off her talented son

10:15.983 --> 10:18.385
to the Natesville
Music Academy again.

10:18.451 --> 10:21.254
So everything would be just
like it was when I was 13,

10:21.321 --> 10:23.323
we sawed the legs off
the piano bench

10:23.390 --> 10:25.225
and dug up my old T-shirt.

10:31.899 --> 10:34.702
(plays tinny notes)

10:37.037 --> 10:38.839
That's horrible.

10:38.906 --> 10:40.908
That's the worst "Chopsticks"
I ever heard.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.011
That could make three billion
Chinese switch to forks.

10:44.077 --> 10:46.513
JIMMY:
The only problem was,
nothing worked.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.916
Desperate, we taped my fingers
to Maw Maw's,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.550
hoping that muscle memory
would kick in

10:50.617 --> 10:52.986
and unlock what
that golf club took away.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.988
Not only did that not work,

10:55.055 --> 10:56.990
but I discovered Maw Maw's
boobs itch.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.128
And her undies creep up a lot.
Oh!

11:07.868 --> 11:10.003
Hey, why aren't
you practicing?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.940
Yeah, get in there!
Brought a surprise home.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.208
To recreate what happened when
that bird got in the house.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.244
Guess what it is.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.779
(caws)

11:23.116 --> 11:24.684
Death.

11:24.752 --> 11:26.486
You've come for me.
(caws)

11:26.553 --> 11:28.421
JIMMY:
It's no use.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.323
The recital is tomorrow, and I
still haven't unlocked it,

11:30.390 --> 11:32.559
and I am sick of
Hope watching me suck.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.529
I just have to accept
that what I had is gone.

11:36.596 --> 11:37.998
And I'm never getting it back.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.233
You can't give up!

11:40.300 --> 11:42.803
Jimmy, you're not just
doing this recital for you!

11:42.870 --> 11:45.939
Think about how guilty your mom
feels about what happened.
No, Burt.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.076
Me pushing him to be a star is
what caused this whole mess.

11:49.142 --> 11:50.744
If he wants to stop,
he should stop.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.445
I'm not going to push anymore.

11:52.512 --> 11:54.081
Then I will!

11:54.147 --> 11:55.648
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.417
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.
Burt...

11:57.484 --> 11:59.386
It works! You think Michael
Jackson would've been a star

11:59.452 --> 12:01.488
if it wasn't for
Joe Jackson's abuse?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.589
Stop it.

12:02.655 --> 12:03.857
He may not be a Michael,

12:03.924 --> 12:05.625
but he could be a Tito,
or a Reggie. Get up!

12:05.692 --> 12:08.061
What the hell is
the matter with you?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.164
This is all my fault.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.333
BURT:
First I thought it was cool.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.236
Like we were going to
turn into a family band.

12:16.303 --> 12:19.206
Maybe even do a commercial
about how much we love cotton.

12:19.272 --> 12:24.277
But then it started to be less
about us and more about you.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.846
Shh.

12:25.913 --> 12:29.216
(playing romantic melody)

12:29.282 --> 12:30.951
* Hey, little thing,
let me light your candle... *

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
BURT: I was jealous.First of
how much attention you were

12:33.020 --> 12:34.621
getting from all those
girls in the audience,

12:34.687 --> 12:37.257
but then from all the attention
you were getting from my girl.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.892
So I decided to
challenge you at something

12:38.959 --> 12:41.294
I knew you couldn't beat me at.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.163
Who wants to go
putt-putt golfing?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.764
BURT:
But the way I played that day,

12:44.832 --> 12:47.600
you'd never know that
I owned the course record.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.270
Burt, just pick up the ball
and put it on the course.

12:50.337 --> 12:52.772
Nobody cares what
your score is.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.510
You know what, you guys go
ahead. I'm going to go warn

12:57.577 --> 13:00.948
the manager about some
early-onset algae I saw.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.515
It's fine.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.153
Hey, you can't
take that putter.

13:19.232 --> 13:20.567
* And she thi... *
(thud)

13:24.737 --> 13:26.539
I know it was a
horrible thing to do.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.308
You gotta believe how bad
I felt all those years.

13:28.375 --> 13:29.877
I'll never
forget that day.
(Maw Maw groans)

13:29.943 --> 13:32.412
September 11, 2001.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.347
The day I threw
that damn putter.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.450
I'm so, so sorry.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.686
It's okay, Dad.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.254
It was a freak accident.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.958
Just like me playing the piano
was probably a freak accident.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.727
Look at us, we're
not great at things.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.062
(Maw Maw yelling)

13:49.129 --> 13:51.131
We're normal
at things.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.499
I'm fine with that.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.335
Well, don't beat yourself
up too bad about it.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.570
It's not like we're
not great at anything.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.208
We're great at drinking beer.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.742
Amen.

14:02.809 --> 14:04.777
(crow cawing)

14:04.844 --> 14:07.547
MAW MAW:
You're not taking me before
you take Betty White!

14:07.614 --> 14:09.549
(cawing)

14:13.653 --> 14:17.457
(slurring): And not for nothing,
but I am very, very proud

14:17.524 --> 14:22.029
of the fact that I-I am a very,
very, very fast grocery bagger.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.863
BURT:
You know a talent I
have that I have

14:23.931 --> 14:25.899
great proudishness
for is my ability

14:25.966 --> 14:29.402
to roll a Frisbee on
its side very, very far.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.204
Hey, 90% of the time

14:31.271 --> 14:35.775
I can guess exactly
what time it is.

14:35.842 --> 14:41.248
I mean, you know, um...
within 20 minutes either way.

14:41.314 --> 14:43.450
You know something
we're all great at?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.053
Running fast down
a flight of stairs.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.420
Yes.
Gravity does most of the work,

14:47.487 --> 14:49.456
but you got to know
where to put your feet.
Uh-huh.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.758
I will tell you...
I'll tell you right now

14:51.824 --> 14:54.727
one of the best... best
things that we're great at...

14:54.794 --> 14:56.296
Oh, what's that?

14:56.363 --> 14:57.230
I forgot.

14:57.297 --> 14:59.732
Oh, it was good, too.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.968
I got it, I got it.
Damn it.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.902
We're really great at
loving each other.

15:02.970 --> 15:04.137
Aw.

15:04.204 --> 15:07.040
Jimmy, as my father,
I want you to know

15:07.107 --> 15:09.842
no matter how much you do
or do not suck at things,

15:09.909 --> 15:13.446
I am never gonna let you go.

15:13.513 --> 15:16.483
(slurred, off-key):
* I'm never gonna let you go *

15:16.549 --> 15:20.187
* Gonna hold you
in my arms forever *

15:20.253 --> 15:23.256
* Gonna try and make up
for the times *

15:23.323 --> 15:25.492
* I hurt you so *

15:25.558 --> 15:26.759
* Gonna... *

15:26.826 --> 15:29.696
(soulfully): * Gonna hold your
body close to mine *

15:29.762 --> 15:33.000
* From this day on,
we're gonna be together *

15:33.066 --> 15:34.968
* Oh, I swear this time *

15:35.035 --> 15:38.405
* I'm never gonna
let you go... *

15:40.507 --> 15:42.742
Oh, my God...

15:42.809 --> 15:44.444
Jimmy...

15:44.511 --> 15:47.280
How old were you when you
started sneaking beers?

15:47.347 --> 15:49.516
Uh, I think I was 13.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.718
Get to the piano!

15:54.687 --> 15:59.092
* I'm gonna hold you
in my arms forever *

15:59.159 --> 16:02.162
* Gonna try to make up
for all the times *

16:02.229 --> 16:05.065
* I hurt you so *

16:05.132 --> 16:07.100
* Gonna... *

16:07.167 --> 16:08.901
We unlocked it.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.937
We unlocked it!

16:11.004 --> 16:13.440
* ...we're gonna be together *

16:13.506 --> 16:15.842
* Oh, I swear this time *

16:15.908 --> 16:17.577
* I'm never gonna let you go. *

16:22.382 --> 16:25.685
Ow. You hit a tangle. Easy.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.987
You don't think Bieber has
people fussing over him?

16:28.055 --> 16:29.389
Now be still.

16:29.456 --> 16:31.091
Sabrina was so excited
when I told her

16:31.158 --> 16:32.625
I was going to play today.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.395
I'm thinking of doing this
Springsteen-Courtney Cox thing

16:35.462 --> 16:36.796
where I bring her on stage.

16:36.863 --> 16:38.298
Tie's done.

16:38.365 --> 16:40.700
Go run through your
song a few times.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.070
And open up the windows
so the neighbors can hear.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.737
I want that family
with the mailbox that

16:44.804 --> 16:46.539
looks like the space shuttle
to know we've got

16:46.606 --> 16:48.475
good stuff going on
over here, too.

16:48.541 --> 16:49.376
Go on.

16:49.442 --> 16:53.046
(Jimmy playing piano badly)

16:53.113 --> 16:54.414
He'll warm up.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.583
(singing off-key):
* Baby, here I am *

16:56.649 --> 16:58.318
* I'm the man on the scene... *

16:58.385 --> 17:03.556
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no ...

17:03.623 --> 17:05.525
What's happening?
I don't know!

17:05.592 --> 17:06.826
It's gone.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.162
Everything
I could do is gone.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.530
Wait a minute.

17:10.597 --> 17:12.832
What's different about
right now from last night?

17:12.899 --> 17:14.467
About eight beers?

17:14.534 --> 17:16.669
That's right.
You were drunk.

17:16.736 --> 17:19.372
Okay, this makes perfect sense.
I saw an episode of Family Guy

17:19.439 --> 17:22.109
where their dad could only play
piano when he was drunk.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.276
VIRGINIA:
Yes!

17:23.343 --> 17:24.944
And I saw a sitcom on ABC

17:25.011 --> 17:27.980
where a lady couldn't speak
Italian unless she was drunk.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.216
BURT:
All right!

17:29.282 --> 17:31.184
You know what else
we're great at?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.919
Remembering important
things we see on TV

17:32.985 --> 17:34.821
that help us navigate
the rough waters of our lives.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.162
Ah.
Burt...

17:42.229 --> 17:43.463
stop drinking
Jimmy's beers.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.365
All his talent is in those cans.

17:45.432 --> 17:48.268
And let him drink alone?
Like some alcoholic?

17:48.335 --> 17:49.936
I may not have
been the best father,

17:50.002 --> 17:51.070
but if you think I'm gonna...

17:51.138 --> 17:52.539
Okay, okay.
Forget I mentioned it.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.607
(playing Beethoven's
"Ode to Joy")

18:01.248 --> 18:03.583
SABRINA:
Is Jimmy drunk?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.552
VIRGINIA:
He and his father just
had a couple drinks

18:05.618 --> 18:08.621
on the way over, you know,
just to calm the nerves.
Right.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.690
Play "The Devil
Went Down to Georgia!"

18:18.865 --> 18:22.235
Our next performer is quite
a bit older than the rest,

18:22.302 --> 18:23.570
but I allowed it
because his parents

18:23.636 --> 18:25.272
have promised
to both cut my lawn

18:25.338 --> 18:27.274
and clean my house
for the next month.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.309
James Chance.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.577
(applause)
I made that boy
with my wang!

18:38.885 --> 18:40.753
(playing off-key intro)

18:46.593 --> 18:51.264
(tunelessly): * Baby, I am,
I'm the man on the scene *

18:51.331 --> 18:54.133
* I can give you what you want *

18:54.201 --> 18:57.737
* But you gotta
come home with me *

18:57.804 --> 18:59.105
* I have got
some good ol' lovin' *

18:59.172 --> 19:01.908
* I got some more in store *

19:01.974 --> 19:03.576
I'm gonna go.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.279
I don't think Jimmy will
remember seeing me here,

19:06.346 --> 19:08.481
and I'd rather
not remember, either.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.251
(Jimmy playing badly)

19:11.318 --> 19:12.652
What is going on?

19:12.719 --> 19:14.254
Did we not get him
drunk enough?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.922
He sounds terrible.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.057
What are you talking about?

19:18.124 --> 19:20.860
He sounds fantastic.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.129
(echoey, in tune):
* Pretty little thing,
let me light your candle *

19:23.196 --> 19:26.165
* 'Cause, mama, I'm sure hard to
handle, now, gets around *

19:26.233 --> 19:28.201
(Jimmy playing beautifully)

19:28.268 --> 19:30.136
Oh, my God.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.839
He wasn't good last night.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.875
We just thought he was
because we were all drunk!

19:38.077 --> 19:40.547
(plays tunelessly)

19:46.819 --> 19:48.555
(Virginia gasps)

19:48.621 --> 19:49.489
(sighs)

19:49.556 --> 19:51.358
Oh.
(chuckles)

19:51.424 --> 19:54.093
("Ode to Joy" plays tentatively
on piano)

19:54.160 --> 19:55.562
Did you hear that?

19:55.628 --> 19:56.963
VIRGINIA:
I did.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.998
That wasn't bad.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.733
I mean, I'm not saying it's
a song or anything, but...

20:00.800 --> 20:03.503
It sounded like something,
right? Am I crazy?

20:03.570 --> 20:04.837
BURT:
You're not crazy.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.205
That sounded like a
couple notes from...

20:06.273 --> 20:08.174
Oh, who's that dude
with Barbara Walters' hair

20:08.241 --> 20:11.043
and named after the movie dog?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.646
Beethoven.
Yes!

20:13.713 --> 20:16.483
(cooing)

20:16.549 --> 20:19.218
I think she may have your gift.

20:20.353 --> 20:23.923
(plays random notes)

20:23.990 --> 20:27.093
(playing beautifully)

20:27.159 --> 20:28.328
(cawing)
BURT: I got it!

20:28.395 --> 20:30.096
JIMMY:
Sometimes as adults

20:30.162 --> 20:32.965
we have to give up the dreams
we had as children.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.734
And that stings.

20:34.801 --> 20:36.603
But when you have kids,
it stings a little less.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.705
Because the emptiness you
feel from your lost dreams

20:38.771 --> 20:42.509
is more than filled up with
the dreams you have for them.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.211
If I can stay lucid
for an hour after school

20:45.278 --> 20:49.349
Tuesdays and Thursdays,
you've got a bright future.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.819
I think she's gonna be great.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.754
And I'm not giving
up on you yet, either.

20:54.821 --> 20:56.756
I put that video of you
playing on the Internet.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.492
It's got seven hits already.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.729
You might just be famous yet.

21:02.795 --> 21:04.531
JIMMY: * Hey, little thing,
let me light your candle *

21:04.597 --> 21:07.800
* 'Cause, mama, I'm sure... *

21:07.867 --> 21:10.503
* Hard... *

21:10.570 --> 21:14.474
* To handle... *

21:14.541 --> 21:16.909
* Whoa-oa-oa... *

21:16.976 --> 21:18.445
* Yeah *

21:20.447 --> 21:25.385
* Hey... *

21:32.291 --> 21:35.995
Eight hits!

21:36.062 --> 21:38.064
Thanks for watching
our son's show.
