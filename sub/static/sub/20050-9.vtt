00:16.601 --> 00:18.310
Don't you think
we should at least check

00:18.394 --> 00:19.896
on Lahey and Randy?

00:19.979 --> 00:21.773
I mean, bring them
some food,
maybe some water?

00:21.856 --> 00:23.315
Fuck that, man.
They'll be fine.

00:23.399 --> 00:25.526
We'll let them
sweat it out a bit,

00:25.610 --> 00:27.152
the fucking assholes.

00:27.612 --> 00:29.530
Snoop's guy's here.

00:29.614 --> 00:31.741
Right on.
(Loud muffled hip hop)

00:31.824 --> 00:34.535
Hopefully he's not a dick.

00:34.619 --> 00:37.329
Bubbles:
Hopefully he's not
deaf, Jesus Murphy!

00:37.413 --> 00:39.540
Keep it down on
the volume, guys.

00:39.624 --> 00:41.333
(Louder hip hop)

00:41.417 --> 00:43.920
Waddup, man?

00:44.003 --> 00:46.338
That's one hell
of an Uber, cuz!

00:46.422 --> 00:49.300
Waddup?
Sammy OG, Snoop's guy.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.551
Bubbles.

00:50.635 --> 00:51.761
Ricky, my man.
How are ya?

00:51.844 --> 00:53.387
Nice mothafuckin'

Mmm!

00:56.975 --> 00:58.392

00:58.476 --> 01:00.311
Yeah, man.
Will those fucking
boxes work or what?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.229
Work? They work,
mothafucker!

01:02.313 --> 01:04.607
They perfect! Mmm!

01:04.690 --> 01:05.900
Beautiful!

01:05.984 --> 01:07.192
(Fingers snapping)
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:07.276 --> 01:08.444
Listen, the boat'll
be here

01:08.527 --> 01:09.779
tomorrow
mothafuckin'
morning.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.155
Get this mothafuckin'
deal done!

01:11.238 --> 01:12.406
Yeah!

01:12.490 --> 01:13.658
But right now,

01:13.741 --> 01:15.117
my trailer park
nizzles,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.119
we about to have a
mothafuckin' tizzle.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.412
A toast,
mothafucker.

01:18.496 --> 01:19.956
I love this shit.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.248
Bubbles:
About that nizzle
tizzle toast...

01:21.332 --> 01:23.001
Tizzle toast.
One for you.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.336
One for you.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.712
Oh, here,
just wait.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.088
I don't need one.
I can't drink that.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.465
That'll knock me
right on my arse.

01:29.548 --> 01:30.842
Ain't that the
whole fuckin' point?

01:30.925 --> 01:32.426
Yeah, come on,
Bubs.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.595
It's a pretty
fucking special
occasion here, bud.

01:34.679 --> 01:38.140
Ricky, I don't succumb
to peer pressure.
I don't need this.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.433
Ricky:
What kind of fucking
peer pressure?

01:39.517 --> 01:41.060
Just do it,
you fucking pussy!

01:41.143 --> 01:42.645
Yeah, come on.
I'm doing one, man.
Don't be a pussy.

01:42.728 --> 01:43.938
Do it, Bubs!
Do it!

01:44.022 --> 01:45.690
This is what
peer pressure is,

01:45.773 --> 01:46.941
right here!
What is?

01:47.025 --> 01:48.275
We're not...
Just fucking do it!

01:48.359 --> 01:49.485
Just fucking do it,
Bubs. Come on!

01:49.568 --> 01:50.778
Oh, my God!
All right!

01:50.862 --> 01:52.112
L'Chaim,
motherfucker!

01:52.196 --> 01:53.322
Cheers.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.573
Fuck's sakes...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.410
(Gibberish)

02:00.079 --> 02:02.206
Well I guess there's
one more thing to do.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.499
What's that?

02:03.582 --> 02:06.085
Get more fucked up!
(Laughing)

02:06.168 --> 02:08.086
More fucked up
that what this is
going to fuck us up?

02:08.169 --> 02:11.007
Hell yeah! Snoop said
y'all are just as
crazy as he is.

02:11.090 --> 02:12.257
Well, surprise...

02:12.341 --> 02:13.509
So am I!

02:13.592 --> 02:14.844
Right the fuck
on, man!

02:14.927 --> 02:16.387
We should get over
to the T Box.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.722
Tyrone and the Rocpile
got the bus over there,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.473
that'll hotbox
the balls right off you!

02:19.557 --> 02:21.059
It's fucking
killer!
Oh, shit!

02:21.141 --> 02:22.393
Let's do that shit
right now, cuz.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.729
Fucking right!
Oh, my God,
those guys...

02:24.812 --> 02:26.522
Cory:
Dudes?
What?

02:26.605 --> 02:28.190
You need to come in
and see this right now.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.441
See what?

02:29.525 --> 02:31.861
Fuck, is Jacob
turning red again?

02:31.944 --> 02:33.863
Who's the mothafucker
in the tank top?

02:33.946 --> 02:37.575
He's Cory.
He's not that smart.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.618
A'ight.

02:39.702 --> 02:42.080
Ricky:
What did you fucking diddle
dummies fuck up this time?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.082
Newscaster: (On TV)

we killed
Lahey and Randy!

03:11.358 --> 03:14.361
(Theme music)

03:53.067 --> 03:55.486
So how do you like LA,
dude? I bet I'd like LA.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.404
Bubbles:
Jesus, Ricky!

03:57.488 --> 03:59.073
Cory, what are you doing?
Get your hand down.

03:59.157 --> 04:01.784
Get back to work, man.
We've got to get this done.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.786
Hey, what's with
all the cameras, cuz?

04:03.869 --> 04:05.579
They're just documenting
our lives, man.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.081
It's all good.
Don't worry about it.

04:07.165 --> 04:08.916
Oh, fuck, Ricky!

04:09.000 --> 04:11.961
Oh, okay. I'm out,
dudes, see you later!

04:12.044 --> 04:13.587
Bubbles:
Oh my God, this is it, boys!

04:13.671 --> 04:15.923
Hey, where you guys
off to in such a rush?

04:16.007 --> 04:17.591
Ricky:
We're not off to any place, man.

04:17.675 --> 04:19.218
What's up, guys?

04:19.301 --> 04:21.678
Oh, I think you
know what's up.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.222
I'm going to need
you to come downtown

04:23.305 --> 04:25.265
to answer a few
questions about
the disappearance

04:25.349 --> 04:27.977
and possible murder
of Jim and Randy.

04:28.060 --> 04:29.228
(Chuckling)

04:29.311 --> 04:30.688
You know anything
about that?

04:30.771 --> 04:31.939
No. No idea what
you're talking about.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.398
You got any
evidence?

04:33.482 --> 04:34.859
Yeah, actually,
we do.
Oh.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.111
That's why I need all
of you to come downtown.

04:37.195 --> 04:40.114
(Chuckles)
You too.

04:40.198 --> 04:43.283
So we can do this
the easy way

04:43.367 --> 04:45.995
or we can do it
the hard way.
Your choice.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.287
Yo, what are
you talking about,

04:47.371 --> 04:48.455
evidence, Officer?

04:48.539 --> 04:49.790
(Chuckling)
Against me?

04:49.874 --> 04:51.458
I got to town,
like, an hour ago.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.544
Okay, you need
to calm down!

04:53.627 --> 04:54.962
Calm down?

04:55.046 --> 04:56.964
The fuck, LAPD
McLoving-looking
mothafucka!

04:57.048 --> 04:58.465
I'm calm. I'm
as calm as fuck.

04:58.549 --> 04:59.884
Okay, down
on the ground,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.468
down on the ground!
(Indistinct sputtering)

05:01.552 --> 05:02.803
On the ground.
On the...

05:02.887 --> 05:04.055
I know the drill,
all right? Hey...

05:04.138 --> 05:06.306
Jesus Murphy!
He was being calm!

05:06.390 --> 05:08.059
He wasn't
doing anything!

05:08.142 --> 05:10.394
Hey! What the hell
is wrong with you
mothafuckas?

05:10.477 --> 05:12.021
Officer:
Mother-what?
Mothafuckas!

05:12.104 --> 05:14.232
You called us
mother-what?
Yeah! Oh, I'm sorry.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.067
Okay, everybody,
hands behind
your backs.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.693
Oh, this is bullshit!

05:17.776 --> 05:18.986
Okay, just...

05:19.070 --> 05:20.154
Ricky! Ricky! Just...

05:20.238 --> 05:21.488
Cuff 'em!
Cuff him!

05:21.572 --> 05:23.157
Okay, everybody.
Just calm down.

05:23.241 --> 05:24.658
Ricky:
Fuck!

05:24.742 --> 05:25.993
Oh, this is
a beautiful
day, Julian.

05:26.077 --> 05:27.161
Julian:
Guys, they got nothing on us,

05:27.245 --> 05:28.537
don't fucking worry about this.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.872
Bubbles:
(Whimpering)

05:29.955 --> 05:31.999
You can stop
twisting my wrist...

05:32.083 --> 05:34.126
Ricky:
This is absolutely fucking
ridiculous! You guys are...

05:34.210 --> 05:37.255
(Whispering)
I told you the liquor
would tell us what to do!

05:37.337 --> 05:38.589
We did it, bud!

05:38.672 --> 05:40.549
(Kissing)

05:40.632 --> 05:42.218
Okay, what
do we do next?

05:42.301 --> 05:43.802
The liquor's
brilliant, sir.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.846
It sure is,
Randilly-bar.

05:45.930 --> 05:48.266
That's what
I've been fucking
trying to tell you!

05:48.348 --> 05:50.517
(Engine starting)

05:50.601 --> 05:52.436
On to Plan B, bud.

05:52.519 --> 05:55.022
Won't that be Phase Two,
though, Mr. Lahey?

05:55.106 --> 05:57.316
I mean, busting
them for the weed
is the next step

05:57.399 --> 05:58.525
but it's all
still part

05:58.609 --> 05:59.860
of the same plan,
isn't it?

05:59.944 --> 06:02.113
Yeah, absolutely
right, Randy.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.865
It's Phase Two.

06:04.949 --> 06:08.035
Wait. What if
someone sees us,
though, Mr. Lahey?

06:08.119 --> 06:09.828
If anyone knows
we're alive,

06:09.912 --> 06:12.456
it all falls apart!
You're right,
you're right.

06:12.539 --> 06:15.542
We need to liquor-think
this through, Ran.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.217
What was that?

06:24.635 --> 06:26.929
It wants to
talk to you, Ran.

06:29.807 --> 06:32.143
Disguises.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.394
Ta-da!

06:34.478 --> 06:37.189
Now it's on to Plan B.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.237
God, Ricky, what was
in that fucking stuff?

06:43.321 --> 06:44.446
Every time I think

06:44.529 --> 06:45.739
I'm getting
my faculties back,

06:45.823 --> 06:47.616
I get hit with another
wave of this shit!

06:47.699 --> 06:49.743
(Chuckling)
I know, it's
really floaty.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.411
Isn't it fucking
awesome?

06:51.495 --> 06:52.621
It's not awesome!

06:52.704 --> 06:54.581
It's freaking me
the fuck out!

06:54.665 --> 06:56.416
Come on, Bubbles,
get it together.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.626
Get it together...

06:57.709 --> 06:59.295
I smell a huge
fucking lawsuit

06:59.378 --> 07:01.255
for this pile of
hamster fucking shit!

07:01.339 --> 07:02.756
You got fuck all on us!

07:02.840 --> 07:04.258
Yeah and they got
fuck all on me.

07:04.342 --> 07:06.010
This is fucking
ridiculous!

07:06.093 --> 07:07.636
Hillbilly
backward bitches.

07:07.719 --> 07:09.429
Fuck...
(Chuckling)

07:09.513 --> 07:11.140
Oh fuck,
look who it is!

07:11.223 --> 07:13.767
It's Harvey Hightell
from the fucking Bad
Sheriff movie!

07:13.851 --> 07:15.353
You can't fucking
keep us here
with no evidence,

07:15.435 --> 07:16.687
George,
you fucking prick!

07:16.770 --> 07:17.938
Yeah, mothafucka.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.648
I want the fuck
out of here, cuz,

07:19.731 --> 07:21.108
or we gonna have
a serious problem,
you dig?

07:21.192 --> 07:22.442
Or I'm going to
let Snoop's lawyer

07:22.526 --> 07:23.694
on your mothafuckin'
ass. You dig?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.112
Hm! None
of you guys

07:25.196 --> 07:26.364
are going anywhere.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.448
You really
fucked up this time.

07:28.532 --> 07:29.700
You want
evidence?

07:31.202 --> 07:33.287
We found this inside
a liquor bottle

07:33.371 --> 07:35.164
floating in
Lahey's trailer.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.748
According to what's
written here,

07:36.832 --> 07:38.376
Jim and Randy found
out about a drug deal

07:38.458 --> 07:39.835
you were doing.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.962
So you all
shrink-wrapped them
in their trailer

07:42.046 --> 07:43.339
and pushed them
into the water

07:43.422 --> 07:45.132
to die a slow, terrifying
death by drowning.

07:45.216 --> 07:47.301
And what the fuck
does that got to
do with me, cuz?

07:47.385 --> 07:49.053
Please tell me!

07:49.136 --> 07:50.346
Oh, letter says that
Snoop was sending

07:50.429 --> 07:51.805
Sammy Og to
do the deal.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.473
I'm guessing
that would be you.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.142
That's Sammy OG, Original
Gangsta. Get it right!

07:55.226 --> 07:56.810
George:
Ah, whatever.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.479
I knew you guys were
stupid. But murder?

07:59.563 --> 08:01.399
(Snort)

08:01.481 --> 08:03.192
Oh, Julian...

08:03.275 --> 08:04.943
Are you going to
grant us permission

08:05.027 --> 08:07.154
to search your trailer
or do I have to go through
all the bullshit

08:07.238 --> 08:08.488
of getting
a warrant?

08:08.572 --> 08:10.199
What the fuck do
you think, George?

08:10.282 --> 08:12.326
(Chuckling)

08:12.410 --> 08:14.412
Dumb question.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.039
Dumb question? This
is a dumb situation!

08:17.122 --> 08:18.707
What the fuck!
And why the fuck

08:18.790 --> 08:20.667
would you tell
him about me, man?

08:20.751 --> 08:22.002
Man, we didn't
say shit!

08:22.086 --> 08:23.212
We're not
that fucked.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.339
Then who did?

08:25.423 --> 08:26.840
Just a second,
Ricky.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.176
Why are your
fucking eyes darting
back and forth

08:29.260 --> 08:31.178
a million miles
an hour?
They're not!

08:31.262 --> 08:32.471
Well, I was trying
to see, like,

08:32.554 --> 08:34.056
everything around
me all at once.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.015
Oh, like a
fucking chameleon?

08:36.100 --> 08:37.183
What?

08:37.268 --> 08:38.894
Look at them.
Look at them, Julian.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.187
What the fuck,
Ricky? No, you
didn't, man.

08:40.270 --> 08:41.520
Fuck!

08:41.605 --> 08:42.898
That fucking day
I went golfing
with him,

08:42.981 --> 08:44.107
I thought
he was my dad.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.276
I may or may
have told him

08:45.359 --> 08:46.526
Snoop was sending
Sammy to do the deal

08:46.610 --> 08:48.070
and we were going to
make a lot of money.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.696
Fuck!
What the...

08:49.780 --> 08:51.031
I should kill you
right now!

08:51.115 --> 08:52.699
Why the fuck would
you tell him that?

08:52.783 --> 08:55.035
Are you fucking
dumb? Hmm? Are
you a fucking dope?

08:55.119 --> 08:57.455
I'm not dumb.
I didn't tell him
you were going

08:57.537 --> 08:59.081
to fucking help us
to kill someone.
Oh!

08:59.164 --> 09:01.041
Fuck...
Boys...

09:01.125 --> 09:03.210
We might never
get out of here.

09:05.296 --> 09:06.464
(Bells jingling)

09:10.134 --> 09:11.885
Congratulations,
Raggedy Ran.

09:11.969 --> 09:14.221
You finally made it
on to the force, bud.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.390
Hey! You
look wonderful

09:16.474 --> 09:17.891
in that fucking
costume!

09:17.975 --> 09:19.101
I don't know,
Mr. Lahey.

09:19.184 --> 09:20.394
I thought the point
of all this

09:20.478 --> 09:21.645
was not to
get recognized.

09:21.728 --> 09:22.896
Oh, well, it is.

09:22.980 --> 09:24.940
But when you think
about it,

09:25.023 --> 09:26.233
we are
basically cops.

09:26.317 --> 09:27.485
Right, Randers?

09:27.567 --> 09:28.735
Well, yeah,
pretty much.

09:28.819 --> 09:29.987
Yeah, and...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.489
sometimes the best
place to hide

09:31.571 --> 09:33.491
is right out
in the open.
Right.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.451
You know what
they say, Randers.

09:35.534 --> 09:37.577
Sometimes
what you see

09:37.661 --> 09:39.538
is not always
what you get.

09:40.747 --> 09:43.501
Frig, Mr. Lahey.
I don't know.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.169
Randy,

09:45.252 --> 09:46.753
the liquor is
telling us what to do.

09:46.837 --> 09:48.755
We got to fucking
listen to it!

09:48.839 --> 09:50.090
What?

09:52.259 --> 09:55.471
Time to take it up
a notch, Ayn Randers.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.935
Why the fuck does
this always happen?

10:02.019 --> 10:03.354
All I wanted to do was run

10:03.437 --> 10:05.856
a simple fucking
pizza sauce company.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.149
You got me involved

10:07.232 --> 10:08.650
in a fucking massive
drug deal at sea

10:08.733 --> 10:10.194
and now I'm in jail
on suspicion of murder.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.612
Oh my God!
(Whimpering)

10:12.696 --> 10:14.281
Sammy OG:
Calm down. Hell, cuz.
(Plopping)

10:14.365 --> 10:16.616
I've charged with way
bigger stuff many times

10:16.700 --> 10:18.536
and I ain't even
tripping, cuz.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.078
(Sniffing)
Ooh, you stink!

10:20.162 --> 10:21.372
Look, things are going
to work themselves out.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.789
Goddamn...

10:22.873 --> 10:23.999
Steinberg:
Hello, boys.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.334
Thank fuck.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.960
Now I've got
some good news
and some bad news.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.712
They've officially
charged you but...

10:28.795 --> 10:30.339
they've agreed to
let you out on bail.

10:30.422 --> 10:31.631
Yes!

10:31.715 --> 10:33.633
Ba ba ba ba ba ba!
Not just yet.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.010
It's not going
to be cheap.

10:35.093 --> 10:37.304
It's attempted murder
and some other shit.

10:37.388 --> 10:40.015
You better hope to
God they don't find
those bodies.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.308
How much are
we talking?

10:41.392 --> 10:43.310
It's going
to be 10 grand.

10:43.394 --> 10:45.479
10 grand! Oh, my fuck!
We're doomed!

10:45.563 --> 10:47.565
Hey, don't worry.
I got this. 10 Gs...

10:47.689 --> 10:49.649
Ba ba ba ba ba ba!

10:49.733 --> 10:51.651
That's <i> each.</i>

10:51.735 --> 10:53.320
40 fucking grand?
Yeah.

10:53.404 --> 10:55.697
I'm gonna shit myself!
I'm gonna shit myself!

10:55.780 --> 10:57.032
That's just
to make bail.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.492
Now look, I've...

10:58.576 --> 11:01.620
I'm waiving every
possible fee on my end,

11:01.703 --> 11:04.122
you know. But
the law is the law.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.041
I know 40 K
is a lot.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.667
We got it, okay?

11:07.751 --> 11:09.294
We'll get it
on the other end.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.504
Don't worry, you'll
get it back anyhow.

11:10.588 --> 11:11.838
Snoop'll be cool.
You got it?

11:11.922 --> 11:13.090
Got it, man.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.383
Yeah, well,
I figured there was, uh,

11:14.466 --> 11:16.385
probably some
kind of deal
at play here.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.929
And I'm assuming
that there's
something somewhere

11:19.012 --> 11:20.264
you don't want
anyone to find?

11:20.347 --> 11:21.599
Various:
Yeah.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.183
In my trailer
and the back
of his truck.

11:23.267 --> 11:25.018
You've got to
get a hold of
Cory and Jacob

11:25.102 --> 11:26.686
and tell them
to get all of the
fucking garbage bags

11:26.770 --> 11:28.688
and lobster boxes
out of there
immediately.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.441
Okay?
Okay. I can
do that.

11:30.524 --> 11:32.276
Now they're filing
for a search warrant

11:32.359 --> 11:34.403
but, you know, I might
be able to delay it

11:34.486 --> 11:35.946
for a couple
hours, you know,

11:36.029 --> 11:37.364
for a small fee...

11:37.448 --> 11:39.199
Do it. Okay?
Just do it.

11:39.283 --> 11:40.409
Ba ba ba ba ba ba!

11:40.492 --> 11:42.786
Oh... okay. Great!

11:42.869 --> 11:47.207
Wow, check this out,
boys. Holy fuck!
What the f...?

11:47.291 --> 11:49.126
Why does it
look like that?
Jesus Murphy...

11:49.209 --> 11:51.253
Ricky!
(Flushing)

11:55.299 --> 11:58.135
That's my life
right there.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.553
Down the drain!

12:05.643 --> 12:07.436
Hey.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.771
Just relax, Randy.

12:09.854 --> 12:12.483
See? No one's
the wiser, bud.

12:13.651 --> 12:15.402
Wow...

12:15.486 --> 12:16.736
It feels good,
doesn't it?

12:16.820 --> 12:18.405
It feels great,
Mr. Lahey.

12:18.489 --> 12:19.739
We're really
doing it.

12:19.823 --> 12:20.991
Yeah, we really...
We should have did it

12:21.074 --> 12:22.493
years ago, Randy!

12:22.576 --> 12:24.495
Look, as soon as
we get the money,

12:24.578 --> 12:27.456
I'm going to call Ted,
tell him about the dope.

12:27.539 --> 12:28.832
They'll have
enough evidence

12:28.915 --> 12:30.626
to lock up
those shitiots

12:30.709 --> 12:33.753
for fucking
shiternity, Randy!

12:33.837 --> 12:36.131
I wonder how much
first class tickets are.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.799
Some of the planes
even have beds on them.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.593
Yeah, that's the
mile high club, Ran.

12:39.677 --> 12:40.844
Mile high club!

12:40.927 --> 12:42.095
The mile high club.
Mile high club.

12:42.179 --> 12:43.681
The mile...

12:43.763 --> 12:45.432
Goddamn shit
soldiers, Randy!

12:45.516 --> 12:48.519
They must be moving it
to a new shit nest

12:48.602 --> 12:50.270
for the queen
of shit himself!

12:52.189 --> 12:53.607
Yeah, okay, I'll be
in touch with you guys

12:53.691 --> 12:55.317
about the
extra charges.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.860
Ricky:
Steinberg, think
you can you give us

12:56.943 --> 12:58.111
a lift back to the park?

12:58.195 --> 12:59.446
Oh, Jesus.
I wish I could

12:59.530 --> 13:00.780
but, with the
extra weight, well,

13:00.864 --> 13:02.115
I think I'd need
some gas money.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.284
Gas money?
Goddamn,

13:04.368 --> 13:06.119
you one greasy
mothafucka, ain't you?

13:06.203 --> 13:07.621
Yeah, you know,
that'll probably be

13:07.705 --> 13:09.206
the end of my shocks
too, realistically.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.624
So, uh...

13:10.708 --> 13:11.958
We're not paying
for your fucking
shocks!

13:12.042 --> 13:13.502
Everybody get in.
I call shotgun.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.212
Fuck it.
I call shotgun.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.796
What are you
talking about?
I just called it.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.173
I'm not going in
the mothafuckin'
back!

13:18.256 --> 13:19.717
Are you crazy, cuz?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.301
Julian:
I'm not getting in the
back fucking seat, okay?

13:21.385 --> 13:22.844
I paid for the
fucking gas money.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.304
Sammy:
You know, fuck
it, all right?

13:24.388 --> 13:25.847
Fuck it, just fuck it.
I'll give you 50 bucks

13:25.930 --> 13:27.098
to go in
the back seat.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.350
Have you
got change?
No.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.643
I'll get
in the back.

13:29.727 --> 13:31.770
Hurry up, man.
Get in.

13:31.853 --> 13:35.566
Bubbles:
Ricky, don't pile...

13:35.649 --> 13:37.484
You fucking live
in this thing?

13:37.568 --> 13:39.861
Bubbles:
Ricky, I've already
got fucking oil on me.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.238
Come on in, guys.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.489
Ricky:
This is fucked! We can't fit...

13:42.573 --> 13:43.741
Skooch over, man.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.991
Lots of room, plenty of room.

13:45.075 --> 13:47.827
Julian:
Skooch over! Fuck!

13:47.911 --> 13:49.663
Someone take this.

13:51.289 --> 13:52.499
Jesus Murphy.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.042
Julian:
Oh, for fuck... I can't,

13:54.125 --> 13:55.293
I'm not in, boys.
Ricky:
Ah, fuck me!

13:55.377 --> 13:57.170
Come on, cuz.
Move the fuck over!

13:57.254 --> 13:59.005
Ricky:
Holy fuck, boys!

13:59.089 --> 14:01.174
There's a fucking
pair of pliers
going in my ribs!

14:01.258 --> 14:02.384
Okay, now
watch the leather,

14:02.467 --> 14:03.677
watch the leather.

14:03.761 --> 14:04.886
Various:
Watch my foot! Oh, shit!

14:04.969 --> 14:06.263
The leather,
mothafucka?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.472
This ain't
mothafuckin'
leather.

14:07.556 --> 14:08.890
It's real leather.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.183
Why the fuck you
got rubbers, cuz?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.769
Yeah, I might need
that for the subway.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.852
Okay, listen, everybody
got their seatbelts on?

14:12.936 --> 14:14.938
Ricky:
Just fucking drive!

14:15.021 --> 14:17.274
(Engine choking)

14:17.357 --> 14:18.942
Dammit, you guys had
the doors open so long

14:19.025 --> 14:20.527
you drained
the battery.

14:20.611 --> 14:22.279
How the fuck have
you got cockroaches
in this bitch?

14:22.362 --> 14:24.197
Julian:
Fuck this! Everybody
out! Everybody out!

14:24.281 --> 14:27.033
Yeah, abort!
Abort!

14:27.117 --> 14:30.746
(Groaning)

14:30.829 --> 14:33.248
Jesus Christ!

14:35.834 --> 14:37.544
Jesus Murphy...

14:37.628 --> 14:39.879
Steinberg, let's
go with my money.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.381
Oh, fine....
Lobster shells in there!

14:41.465 --> 14:42.966
Have you got my
mothafuckin' money?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.426
Well, this is weird.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.803
I don't even know
how this is possible.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.388
I think I lost it.
How crazy is that?

14:48.472 --> 14:49.723
Goddamn,
mothafucka!

14:49.807 --> 14:51.642
You fucking ruthless,
you know that?

14:51.725 --> 14:52.892
Next time Snoop's in trouble,

14:52.976 --> 14:54.144
I'm giving
your ass a call.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.895
Hell yeah.
Call me any time.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.899
Yo, T. We need you
to pick us up.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.568
Jail.

15:01.652 --> 15:03.987
There's no way
that a snake
could beat you

15:04.070 --> 15:06.573
in a fist fight
because it doesn't
have fists.

15:06.657 --> 15:09.743
So I don't understand
why anyone loses to
a snake.

15:09.827 --> 15:12.579
(Siren wailing)
But if if curls up in a
ball, couldn't it, like,

15:12.663 --> 15:14.164
really give you
a good shot that way?

15:14.247 --> 15:16.374
Yeah, sure, but it has
to have an arm to be on

15:16.458 --> 15:17.751
in order to swing it.
(Siren continues)

15:17.835 --> 15:19.878
Dude, dude.
What?
Cops behind us, man.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.422
Oh, shit! Well, we
just... Just let them
go by. Just go...

15:22.506 --> 15:24.466
(Siren wailing)

15:24.549 --> 15:25.759
Oh, fuck,
what do we do, man?

15:25.843 --> 15:27.010
I don't know, dude.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.637
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Oh, fuck! Oh man.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.929
They're trying to pull
us over, dude. Oh shit.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.264
Lahey:
Get the fuck
over there,

15:31.348 --> 15:32.683
you fucking asshole!
Okay, okay, okay...

15:32.766 --> 15:34.267
Cory:
Don't say
anything, dude.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.477
I'll do the talking.
I'll do the talking.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.770
(Siren stops)

15:36.854 --> 15:38.980
Cory:
All right. Uh, uh... Shit.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.565
Fuck's sakes.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.653
(Laughing)

15:44.736 --> 15:47.823
Jack-pot!
Hey, d'you get it?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.282
I sure do,
Mr. Lahey.

15:49.366 --> 15:50.492
Because it's pot.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.202
Fucking jack-pot!
Good one.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.371
We're in liquor
synchronicity.
(Laughing)

15:54.454 --> 15:56.331
Hey!

15:56.414 --> 15:58.416
You're not dead!
Awesome!

15:58.500 --> 16:01.127
We thought you guys
were the real cops.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.046
Why are you guys
dressed like that?

16:03.129 --> 16:04.631
Where did you
get the car?

16:04.715 --> 16:06.717
Enough of the
fucking small
talk, boys!

16:06.800 --> 16:07.967
Where's the
fucking money,

16:08.051 --> 16:10.846
you stupid little
shit pissants?

16:10.929 --> 16:13.640
What fucking money?
Don't... touch me.

16:13.724 --> 16:14.850
What fucking
money?

16:14.933 --> 16:16.142
The money that
Snoop Dogg paid

16:16.226 --> 16:17.811
for all this
fucking dope!

16:17.895 --> 16:20.021
What do you think
I am? Stupid, Cory?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.606
Well, obviously
you are stupid

16:21.690 --> 16:24.984
because it's not
even dope that
anyone is buying

16:25.068 --> 16:26.904
if they were buying
anything at all.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.781
Uh, they're not
buying anything.

16:31.575 --> 16:33.493
Okay. You want to
fucking play tough,

16:33.577 --> 16:35.245
Mr. fucking
tough guys?

16:35.328 --> 16:37.873
Get your fucking
cocksuckers in my car!

16:37.956 --> 16:39.666
Get the fuck in
the car right now!

16:39.750 --> 16:41.543
You're under arrest
for burglary!

16:41.626 --> 16:42.794
Get in!

16:44.462 --> 16:46.172
Cory:
Stop throwing the
gun around, dude.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.508
Hop in, Ranbers!

16:48.592 --> 16:50.301
Cory:
What are you doing?
(Engine starts)

16:50.385 --> 16:53.513
Jacob:
You guys are cra...
What are you doing?

16:53.597 --> 16:55.515
You know, you can't
leave that shit there.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.767
(Remote phone ringing)

16:56.850 --> 16:58.017
Julian:
Come on, boys.

16:58.101 --> 16:59.561
Answer the
fucking phone!

16:59.644 --> 17:01.020
Cory: (On phone)
<i>Yo, what's up, dude?</i>

17:01.104 --> 17:02.397
Holy fuck! Where the
fuck are you guys?

17:02.480 --> 17:04.147
Cory:
<i>I'm just fucking with you.</i>

17:04.232 --> 17:05.692
<i>You've reached Cory</i>
<i>and Jacob's phone.</i>

17:05.776 --> 17:07.026
<i>We can't come to</i>
<i>the phone right now,</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:09.362
<i>so leave us a message! Rawr!</i>

17:09.445 --> 17:10.864
Nice message,
assholes.

17:10.948 --> 17:12.531
Where the fuck
are you guys at?

17:12.616 --> 17:13.742
I need to talk
to you. Call me.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.034
It's urgent!

17:16.578 --> 17:17.704
Fuck,
they're dumb.

17:17.788 --> 17:19.038
Maybe
they're not.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.373
They sure made
you look stupid.

17:20.457 --> 17:21.875
That was pretty
brilliance,
I must say.

17:21.959 --> 17:23.334
Julian, just call
my phone.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.252
I'm pretty sure
it's in my truck.

17:25.336 --> 17:26.546
Maybe, if they hear
that ringing,

17:26.630 --> 17:27.881
they'll answer it.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.132
Don't get tricked again,
though, Julian.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.383
Bubbles might have
a trick message

17:30.467 --> 17:32.594
just like Cory
and Jacob.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.053
Ricky, I'm sitting
right here.

17:34.137 --> 17:35.305
Even if I did, like,

17:35.388 --> 17:36.640
how would that
be a trick?

17:36.723 --> 17:39.392
It might be, though.
Think about that one.

17:39.476 --> 17:40.936
Bubbles: (On phone)
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>

17:41.019 --> 17:42.980
<i>Bubbles' Scrumpdilly</i>
<i>Organico Sauce Company,</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:44.564
<i>pizza division. Please</i>
<i>leave a message...</i>

17:44.648 --> 17:46.149
Fuck!

17:46.232 --> 17:47.901
Maybe the cops
got them too.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.694
Did you ever
think of that?

17:49.778 --> 17:51.780
Like, they could be
getting questioned
as we speak.

17:51.863 --> 17:53.740
Man, they might
be dumb but they're
not fucking dicks.

17:53.824 --> 17:55.074
They'd never
rat us out.

17:55.158 --> 17:56.409
Don't worry about it.

17:56.493 --> 17:57.995
Not on purpose
maybe.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.288
(Electricity sizzling)

18:00.371 --> 18:01.790
Lahey:
Time to start talking, boys,

18:01.873 --> 18:04.250
or I'll send goddamn
110 shit amps

18:04.334 --> 18:05.710
through your shitty
little bodies!

18:05.794 --> 18:07.045
What's Snoop
and his guys buying

18:07.128 --> 18:08.254
if it isn't
the weed?

18:08.338 --> 18:09.589
I don't know,
I don't know!

18:09.673 --> 18:10.799
(Whimpering)
(Sizzling)

18:10.882 --> 18:12.050
How did that
feel, Cory?

18:12.133 --> 18:13.468
Keep lying,
I dare you!

18:13.551 --> 18:14.719
I'll do anything,
whatever you want.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.137
Don't ask
for that.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.430
No, dude, don't tell
him about the De-energy!

18:17.514 --> 18:18.640
Ricky will
fucking be pissed!

18:18.723 --> 18:20.224
De-energy?
Fuck.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.768
It's okay, dude.
They don't know
what it is

18:21.852 --> 18:23.645
and there's no way
they can ever find out

18:23.728 --> 18:25.063
about where the
deal's happening on
the ocean tomorrow

18:25.146 --> 18:26.314
because we don't
even know. So...

18:26.397 --> 18:27.649
Five Hour
De-energy!

18:27.732 --> 18:28.817
Ricky makes it
out of weed.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.068
Of course,
Mr. Lahey!

18:30.151 --> 18:31.444
Is that
what it is?

18:31.528 --> 18:32.696
Is that what Snoop's
boys are buying

18:32.779 --> 18:34.447
on the ocean
tomorrow?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.616
You better tell me
where Ricky keeps
his stash,

18:36.700 --> 18:38.159
you shit-glazed
shit!

18:38.242 --> 18:39.452
(Screaming)
(Buzzing)

18:39.536 --> 18:40.704
Does it hurt, Cory?

18:40.787 --> 18:42.121
Fuck yeah!
(Indistinct)

18:43.206 --> 18:46.125
(Buzzing)
(Screaming)

18:46.209 --> 18:48.712
Ah... it hurts!
Enough!

18:48.795 --> 18:50.672
Stop shocking him.
You can shock me instead.

18:50.755 --> 18:51.965
Ah! No, I changed
my mind!

18:52.049 --> 18:53.299
Don't shock me
instead, please...

18:53.383 --> 18:54.968
Cory, we can keep
doing this all day

18:55.052 --> 18:56.219
or you can
just tell me

18:56.302 --> 18:57.971
where Ricky
keeps the goods.

18:58.055 --> 18:59.430
(Buzzing)
(Screaming)

18:59.514 --> 19:00.682
Hey, stop it!
It's on Bubbles'
truck!

19:00.765 --> 19:01.933
Leave him
alone, fuck!

19:02.017 --> 19:03.184
It's on
Bubbles' truck?

19:03.267 --> 19:04.811
(Whimpering)

19:04.895 --> 19:06.980
Oh. Well, that's a
shocking development.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.315
Have a nice
day, boys.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.150
Give me that...

19:11.234 --> 19:15.530
(Muffled music)

19:15.613 --> 19:17.532
I need a blunt!

19:17.615 --> 19:18.909
Motherfuckers,
your prisons

19:18.992 --> 19:20.410
are like preschool.
Know what I mean?

19:20.493 --> 19:21.661
Good luck, T!

19:21.745 --> 19:23.038
Oh, my fucking gosh.

19:23.121 --> 19:24.539
They seized our shit.

19:25.749 --> 19:27.084
What the fucking...
Jules!

19:27.166 --> 19:29.586
You better fix this shit
right fucking now!

19:29.669 --> 19:30.879
I'm working on it.
(Remote phone ringing)

19:30.962 --> 19:32.130
They must not
have found the weed

19:32.213 --> 19:34.007
or you'd be back
in fucking jail.

19:34.091 --> 19:35.383
Bubbles:
Yeah, but the fact
that the truck's gone,

19:35.466 --> 19:36.968
Cory and Jacob must
have came through.

19:37.052 --> 19:38.219
Try calling
my phone again.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.346
What do you think
I'm fucking doing?

19:40.430 --> 19:41.890
No. It went
to voice mail.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.516
But it was
ringing?
Yes, it was ringing.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.393
Okay, well that
means the fucking
thing's on, then.

19:45.476 --> 19:46.686
That's a
good sign.

19:46.770 --> 19:47.896
Pull up the
Find My Phone app.

19:47.979 --> 19:49.188
Do you have that?
The what?

19:49.272 --> 19:50.481
Find My Phone
app, yeah,

19:50.565 --> 19:51.691
I got that shit
right here, cuz.

19:51.775 --> 19:52.943
I lose this bitch
all the time.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.235
All right.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.528
It's gonna cost
you, all right?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.196
Yeah. Okay, just wait.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.949
You just call
someone up and they
find your phone?

19:59.032 --> 20:02.035
No, Ricky, look.
I punch in my number

20:02.119 --> 20:04.662
and it should tell
us where it is.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.539
Okay, look.
Here it is.

20:06.623 --> 20:08.207
They're out on
Doodle-puller Road.

20:08.291 --> 20:10.127
Why the fuck
would they be
way out there?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.087
Oh, fuck! I bet
they pulled over

20:12.170 --> 20:13.546
so Jacob could shit

20:13.630 --> 20:14.798
and the fucking bears
or cougars got them.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.215
Bears and
cougars... what?

20:16.299 --> 20:17.550
They're fucking
probably dead again!

20:17.634 --> 20:19.052
Ricky, what are
you talking about?

20:19.136 --> 20:20.720
Cory: Dudes!
Ricky:
Poor fuckers.

20:20.804 --> 20:22.764
Julian:
What the fuck
happened to you guys?

20:22.847 --> 20:24.265
Randy and Lahey
are alive!

20:24.348 --> 20:25.725
They held us
captive!

20:25.809 --> 20:26.977
They shocked us
with a wire.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.227
They're fucking
crazy.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.562
So what did
you tell them?

20:29.646 --> 20:30.772
They tortured us!
Look at my nips!

20:30.855 --> 20:32.023
Not much, dude.

20:32.107 --> 20:33.274
We just told them
that the deal

20:33.357 --> 20:34.609
was going down
tomorrow

20:34.692 --> 20:36.069
and you're actually
only selling

20:36.153 --> 20:37.695
De-energizer,
not weed.
Oh, what?

20:37.779 --> 20:39.405
So they've got
the truck with all
the shit on it?

20:39.489 --> 20:41.116
No.
Thank fuck.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.118
Well, dude,
they know where
it is, though.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.162
And I'm pretty sure
they're on their
way there now.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.246
Oh my fuck, you guys
are dumb! Fuck!

20:47.330 --> 20:50.792
You're one dumb
piece of shit,
you know that?

20:50.875 --> 20:52.085
Ugh!

20:52.169 --> 20:53.544
Julian:
All right, let's
go! Come on!

20:54.921 --> 20:56.089
Ricky:
Fuck's sakes!

20:56.173 --> 20:57.924
(Indistinct)
...very nice.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.676
Ricky:
Fucking unlock me! Fuck!

20:59.759 --> 21:03.262
(Car doors slamming)

21:03.346 --> 21:05.515
(Engine starting)

21:05.598 --> 21:07.934
(Engine revving)

21:08.018 --> 21:09.477
Hey!

21:09.560 --> 21:10.728
What about us?

21:12.063 --> 21:13.314
Okay, boys.
It's just up here

21:13.397 --> 21:14.649
about a
fucking mile.
Right on.

21:14.732 --> 21:15.859
It looks like.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.902
I can see it.

21:17.986 --> 21:19.278
Just wait
a second,

21:19.362 --> 21:20.571
it looks like
it's fucking moving.

21:20.655 --> 21:21.781
What?
It is moving!

21:21.865 --> 21:23.616
It's coming
right towards us.

21:23.700 --> 21:26.661
Jesus Christ,
Lahey beat us to it!

21:26.744 --> 21:28.287
Oh, fuck!
No he didn't!

21:28.371 --> 21:30.498
The fucking cops got it!

21:30.581 --> 21:31.791
He must have
fucking called them.

21:31.875 --> 21:33.001
We're fucked, boys!

21:33.084 --> 21:35.212
No, I'm fucked!
That's my truck!

21:35.294 --> 21:36.963
Hey! Hey, hey!

21:37.047 --> 21:38.548
What? What?
Turn the car around
right now, cuz!

21:38.631 --> 21:39.799
What?
What do you mean,
turn it around?

21:39.883 --> 21:41.300
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

21:41.384 --> 21:42.802
I ain't leaving here
without my shit!

21:42.886 --> 21:43.970
I ain't a mothafuckin'
mathematician

21:44.054 --> 21:45.722
but there's
two of them

21:45.805 --> 21:47.473
and one, two,
three, four of us,
motherfuckers!

21:47.557 --> 21:48.683
What the fuck are
you talking about?
Seriously?

21:48.766 --> 21:50.601
Yeah, man.
What the fuck?

21:50.685 --> 21:53.021
This is about to be a
hommo case up in this bitch
if you don't turn

21:53.104 --> 21:54.647
this mothafuckin'
car around!

21:54.731 --> 21:56.066
Okay, Julian,
turn the fucking
car around!

21:56.149 --> 21:57.275
Sammy, you best get
that fucking gun

21:57.358 --> 21:58.526
out of my neck,
motherfucker!

21:58.609 --> 22:00.237
Or what?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.779
Bubbles:
Julian, set your drink
down and use your muscles!

22:01.863 --> 22:02.989
Julian:
Let me fucking do it, man!

22:03.073 --> 22:04.407
Sammy:
What the fuck?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.658
You're giving me
mothafuckin' whiplash!

22:05.742 --> 22:07.451
Julian:
Settle the fuck down.

22:07.535 --> 22:08.661
Bubbles:
Ricky, why don't
you hold his drink

22:08.745 --> 22:10.454
so the man can use both his...

22:10.538 --> 22:12.498
Julian:
Just get your hands
off my fucking drink!

22:12.582 --> 22:14.209
All right, cuz,
...faster.

22:14.292 --> 22:15.835
There you go.
Passing up...

22:15.919 --> 22:17.045
Sammy:
All right, cut him off.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.504
Bubbles:
Julian, don't do this.

22:18.588 --> 22:19.923
Sammy:
Cut him off!

22:20.006 --> 22:21.216
I'm cutting him off!
I'm cutting him off!

22:21.299 --> 22:22.717
Fast and the
Furious! Come on!

22:22.800 --> 22:24.510
Bubbles:
For fuck's sakes, Julian!

22:24.594 --> 22:26.512
Ricky:
This is fucked!

22:26.596 --> 22:27.722
Oh, my fuck.
Now what?

22:27.805 --> 22:29.348
All right, listen,

22:29.432 --> 22:30.683
it's like you've seen
in the movies, cuz.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.185
We goin' to get
out of this car

22:32.269 --> 22:34.187
and we goin' to
unload on them
mothafuckas.

22:34.271 --> 22:35.354
You feel me?
What? Unload?

22:35.438 --> 22:36.856
We can't fucking
unload on them!

22:36.940 --> 22:38.524
They're cops,
boys! Please,
come on, Julian,

22:38.608 --> 22:40.193
this is getting
too crazy!

22:40.277 --> 22:42.361
Lahey: (On megaphone)
<i>Exit the vehicle please,</i>

22:42.445 --> 22:44.906
<i>with your hands in the air!</i>

22:44.989 --> 22:46.365
Was that
fucking Lahey?

22:46.449 --> 22:48.159
Who the fuck
is Lahey,
mothafucka?

22:48.243 --> 22:51.037
He's a drunk,
crazy, fucking
deranged lunatic,

22:51.121 --> 22:52.914
who used
to be a cop.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.707
It fucking
sounded like him.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.876
Lahey:
<i>Come on, Shitulian!</i>
<i>Against the car!</i>

22:56.960 --> 22:58.920
<i>Come on, spread</i>
<i>that beautiful frame.</i>

22:59.003 --> 23:00.213
This mothafucka
know you?

23:00.297 --> 23:01.464
Jesus Christ.

23:01.547 --> 23:02.882
It's definitely
him.

23:02.966 --> 23:05.635
"Spread your
beautiful frame"?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.053
What the fuck?

23:07.137 --> 23:08.721
I want you all to
put your hands up.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.973
Randy:
You guys almost killed us!

23:10.056 --> 23:11.224
The jig is up.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.934
You're going
to pay up, boys.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.811
Hey! You better
put that gun away,
mothafucka!

23:14.894 --> 23:16.646
Right now.
One, two, three.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.897
There you go.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.440
Do you want me
to pop a cap

23:19.523 --> 23:20.733
in your mothafuckin'
ass, boy?
What?

23:20.817 --> 23:22.068
You want some lead
in your head? Huh?

23:22.152 --> 23:23.278
Yeah!
Yeah?

23:23.361 --> 23:24.570
Yeah!
What?

23:24.654 --> 23:25.780
Okay!
Okay?

23:25.863 --> 23:27.115
I don't
fucking care!

23:27.198 --> 23:28.449
Put a fucking
cack in my head!
Cack?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.867
Go on, do it!

23:29.951 --> 23:31.077
Fucking put me out of
my misery, bud!

23:31.161 --> 23:32.329
Oh, Mr. Lahey!
Do it!

23:32.411 --> 23:33.621
Don't! I love you,
Mr. Lahey.

23:33.704 --> 23:34.914
Why?

23:34.998 --> 23:36.082
Look, frig all
this stuff!

23:36.166 --> 23:38.417
Let's just...
We don't have

23:38.501 --> 23:39.961
to fly to Ireland
and get married.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.629
Let's just
walk away.

23:41.712 --> 23:43.464
Lahey:
I'm sorry, Randy.
Ireland?

23:43.547 --> 23:45.258
You're right, bud.

23:45.342 --> 23:48.094
I'm out of control.
Excuse me.

23:48.178 --> 23:51.639
I got so fucked
over losing Mo

23:51.722 --> 23:54.725
and I spent half
my fucking life
trying to love

23:54.809 --> 23:58.771
this dumb fucking
shit-covered shit-log

23:58.855 --> 24:01.024
and he's not even
my fucking son!

24:01.107 --> 24:02.400
Thank fuck!

24:02.483 --> 24:04.319
I don't want to
take it any more.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.196
Go ahead.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.530
Anyway...

24:07.613 --> 24:09.824
none of this matters
any more, boys.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.117
You know why?

24:11.201 --> 24:13.286
Because we're fucked!

24:13.370 --> 24:14.495
Take a look at that.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.289
Various:
Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

24:16.373 --> 24:18.082
Lahey:
Yeah, that's a little bit...
(Siren honking)

24:18.166 --> 24:19.876
...of a sweet
shit-tasting
irony, isn't it?

24:19.959 --> 24:21.419
Fuck! I'm not going
to mothafuckin' jail,
cuz! Fuck this!

24:21.502 --> 24:22.879
Put the gun away!
Put the fucking gun away!

24:22.962 --> 24:24.130
Put the fucking gun away!

24:24.214 --> 24:25.382
We're not
fucking getting

24:25.464 --> 24:26.632
in a gunfight
with the cops!

24:26.716 --> 24:27.884
Okay, listen! Listen.

24:27.967 --> 24:29.468
Lahey?
Yeah?

24:29.552 --> 24:31.012
We've all be through
a lot here, okay?
Right.

24:31.095 --> 24:32.680
If I can somehow get us
all out of this shit,

24:32.763 --> 24:34.515
you have to promise to
leave us the fuck alone.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.475
Don't tell the cops
about the deal.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.935
We'll get it done
and everything at
the trailer park

24:38.019 --> 24:39.187
will go back to
fucking normal.

24:39.270 --> 24:40.479
You have our word.
Right, boys?

24:40.563 --> 24:41.647
Various:
Yes, yeah.

24:41.731 --> 24:42.982
How does that
sound, Mr. Lahey?

24:43.066 --> 24:44.192
I just want
to be together.

24:44.275 --> 24:45.484
I'd rather not
be in jail.

24:45.568 --> 24:47.153
All right... okay.
Beautiful.

24:47.237 --> 24:48.654
Thank fuck,
it's Ted Johnson,

24:48.738 --> 24:50.531
the second dumbest
cop on the force.

24:50.614 --> 24:54.411
Well, look who's
alive after all!

24:54.493 --> 24:56.662
Nice outfits.

24:56.746 --> 24:59.457
New car, Jim?

24:59.540 --> 25:02.835
Nice beard.
Both of them.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.337
So this is where
you've been, eh?

25:04.421 --> 25:06.172
Busy buying costumes

25:06.256 --> 25:07.882
and stealing
police cars.

25:07.965 --> 25:09.592
That's a really
nice suit you
got there, bud.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.178
Fucking... it must
be really expensive.
I'm impressed.

25:12.262 --> 25:13.471
Well, Ted, thank fuck
you're here, man.

25:13.554 --> 25:15.181
Crazy fucking
morning, man!

25:15.265 --> 25:16.974
We were on our way
down to the wharf

25:17.058 --> 25:18.226
and a guy
flagged us down

25:18.309 --> 25:19.560
who was driving
this police car here

25:19.643 --> 25:20.853
and he said he was
an undercover cop.

25:20.937 --> 25:22.105
Ted:
Okay?

25:22.188 --> 25:23.522
Well, of course
we pulled over.

25:23.606 --> 25:24.857
We like helping the police
whenever we can.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.567
Anyway, he said
he ran out of gas

25:26.650 --> 25:28.278
and he had two of
Satan's Bastards
in the car.

25:28.361 --> 25:29.737
It was really fishy.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.197
Like, he was really
super fucking nervous.

25:31.281 --> 25:32.823
So I looked in the car
and quickly realized

25:32.907 --> 25:34.367
it was fucking Lahey and
Randy in the back seat.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.785
They were tied up.
Right.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.370
I was, like, "Bud,
you are full of shit.

25:37.454 --> 25:38.579
You're not an
undercover cop."

25:38.662 --> 25:39.872
I fucking freaked out

25:39.956 --> 25:41.374
and then I think
he knew what
was going on,

25:41.458 --> 25:42.583
so he panicked
and fucking ran

25:42.666 --> 25:43.876
through the
tall grass here

25:43.960 --> 25:45.378
and jumped
in the water.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.046
The last I saw of him
he was half-way across

25:47.130 --> 25:48.381
the land there, swimming.
It was fucking crazy, man.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.799
Like, you're going
to have to go

25:49.882 --> 25:51.050
after the
fucking guy.

25:51.134 --> 25:52.260
Wow, that is
pretty crazy.
Yeah!

25:52.343 --> 25:53.552
It's quite a story.
Yeah.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.388
Now, Jim.
Hm?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.807
Do you want to tell
me what's really
going on here?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.184
Yeah, well, Ricky told
you the absolute truth.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.936
If it wasn't
for these guys,

26:02.019 --> 26:04.230
Randy and I,
we'd be fucking
dead by now, Ted.

26:04.314 --> 26:05.482
Right.
Right...

26:05.564 --> 26:07.150
And you fucking
police dummies

26:07.233 --> 26:08.443
made them go
through hell.
Hm!

26:08.526 --> 26:10.027
Instead of being out
looking for them,

26:10.111 --> 26:11.237
you accuse us
of fucking
murdering them.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.571
You better drop
those charges

26:12.655 --> 26:14.407
and give us back
our fucking money!

26:14.491 --> 26:15.908
Just shut up,
Ricky.

26:15.992 --> 26:17.494
I will for a second.
That's it.
Shut up!

26:17.576 --> 26:18.828
Fuck off!

26:18.911 --> 26:20.121
And Jim...
Hm?

26:20.204 --> 26:22.123
What about that letter
that you wrote?

26:22.206 --> 26:24.792
The one we found
in your camper.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.127
You know?

26:26.210 --> 26:27.420
Yeah, you were
telling us about that.

26:27.504 --> 26:28.629
It was the
kidnappers, was it?

26:28.712 --> 26:30.340
Oh! The fucking
kidnapper!

26:30.423 --> 26:32.925
He forced me
to do it at
gunpoint, Ted!

26:33.009 --> 26:34.635
Fucking heavy
duty shit.

26:35.845 --> 26:38.681
You guys are all
so full of shit!

26:38.764 --> 26:39.932
I <i> have</i> to shit...

26:40.016 --> 26:41.267
But you know
what? No.

26:41.351 --> 26:43.520
I don't even
care any more.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.770
Now I've got
a police matter

26:44.854 --> 26:45.980
that I have
to deal with.

26:46.063 --> 26:47.524
It's a real one.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.192
So, Randy,

26:49.275 --> 26:50.443
in order
to make sure

26:50.527 --> 26:51.694
that the paperwork
on this

26:51.777 --> 26:52.945
is filed properly,

26:53.029 --> 26:55.448
I'll have to
see you later.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.116
Actually,

26:57.200 --> 26:59.369
we both will.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.287
For frig's sakes.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.039
Ricky:
For what?

27:03.122 --> 27:04.499
Ted:
You take my car.

27:04.582 --> 27:07.960
I'll grab the cruiser
that these idiots stole.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.463
And the next time...
(Engine starts)

27:10.547 --> 27:13.007
any of you people
even get

27:13.090 --> 27:15.176
as much as
a parking ticket,

27:15.259 --> 27:16.427
I'm going to throw
your ass in jail

27:16.511 --> 27:18.471
so fast it'll make
your heads spin!

27:18.555 --> 27:20.139
You got that?

27:20.223 --> 27:21.474
Absolutely.
Yep.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.518
I don't live here
but sure, cuz.

27:23.601 --> 27:24.768
Good.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.604
Fuck, my eyes
are really dry.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.897
I don't know what
the fuck's going
on there.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.690
Keys are in
the ignition, Ted!

27:29.773 --> 27:31.067
Mothafucka!

27:31.150 --> 27:33.403
You was one slick
Rick mothafucka!

27:33.486 --> 27:34.987
I fuck with your shit!

27:35.071 --> 27:36.406
Real good!
You should be

27:36.489 --> 27:38.199
on my mothafuckin'
payroll, cuz. I got you!

27:38.282 --> 27:39.576
Thank God
cops are dumb.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.202
That was a way
fucking better
plan than you had.

27:41.285 --> 27:42.703
"Let's blast
everybody!"

27:42.786 --> 27:44.288
That's all I know.

27:44.372 --> 27:45.748
Randy:
Thanks for keeping us
out of jail, Ricky.

27:45.831 --> 27:46.999
Okay, boys!

27:47.083 --> 27:48.334
What's next
on the agenda?

27:48.418 --> 27:49.835
This is what's next.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.170
Julian, what
are you doing?

27:51.254 --> 27:52.755
Julian!

27:52.838 --> 27:54.173
I thought
we had a deal!

27:54.257 --> 27:55.674
There is no deal.

27:55.758 --> 27:57.176
Get the fuck
in my trunk.

27:57.260 --> 27:58.428
(Gun click)

27:58.511 --> 28:00.555
Ricky:
(Chuckling)

28:00.638 --> 28:03.849
(Theme music)

28:45.224 --> 28:48.311
(Seabirds squawking)

29:00.323 --> 29:04.452
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

29:04.535 --> 29:07.121
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:11.000 --> 29:12.418
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

29:12.502 --> 29:14.587
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>
