<c.speaker>Blaze!

01:07.875 --> 01:09.000
<c.speaker>For good.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
<c.speaker>-How am I--?
-The milagra.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.375
<c.speaker>It lets you breathe
underwater!

01:13.375 --> 01:14.750
<c.speaker>Let this be remembered

01:14.750 --> 01:16.625
<c.speaker>as the day sirenas
and humans

01:16.625 --> 01:19.166
<c.speaker>defended Avalor together

01:19.166 --> 01:22.000
<c.speaker>and began a new era
of friendship.

<c.speaker>[Elena]
<i>"The Tides of Change." </i>

01:26.125 --> 01:28.583
<c.speaker>[Mateo]
OK, let's try that
new power.

01:29.958 --> 01:30.958
<c.speakerTop>Bloom!

01:35.083 --> 01:37.458
<c.speakerTop>-[sighs]
-What happened?

01:37.458 --> 01:39.708
<c.speakerTop>It's my scepter.
It hasn't been working right

01:39.708 --> 01:41.458
<c.speakerTop>ever since Shuriki blasted it.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.333
<c.speakerTop>Princess Elena.
The Grand Council

01:43.333 --> 01:45.208
<c.speakerTop>-is waiting for you.
-[gasps] Oh, no!

01:45.208 --> 01:46.625
<c.speaker>I forgot about the meeting!

01:49.708 --> 01:51.375
<c.speaker>Sorry I'm late!

01:51.375 --> 01:54.250
<c.speaker>[sighs] You should be,
since you called the meeting.

01:54.250 --> 01:56.333
<c.speaker>Now, what is so important, hm?

01:56.333 --> 01:58.958
<c.speaker>Shuriki is defeated,
peace has been restored...

01:58.958 --> 02:01.875
<c.speaker>Not to mention, we're supposed
to be on vacation.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.291
<c.speaker>-This is true.
-[Elena] Well...

02:03.291 --> 02:05.250
<c.speaker>about peace being restored,

02:05.250 --> 02:07.458
<c.speaker>I think it's important
we make our friendship

02:07.458 --> 02:11.708
<c.speaker>with the sirenas official
and sign a unity pact
with King Pescoro. Hm?

02:11.708 --> 02:13.375
<c.speaker>That is ridiculous!

02:13.375 --> 02:16.708
<c.speaker>I cut short my pre-siesta
siesta for this?

02:16.708 --> 02:19.291
<c.speaker>I think that is
an excellent idea.

02:19.291 --> 02:24.083
<c.speaker>Me, too! The sirenas
helped us defeat Shuriki.
They are our allies.

02:24.083 --> 02:26.625
<c.speaker>Allies? They did
one nice thing!

02:26.625 --> 02:29.708
<c.speaker>That doesn't erase all the years
of bad things they've done.

02:29.708 --> 02:33.125
<c.speaker>I agree, but this pact
will give the sirenas a chance

02:33.125 --> 02:34.875
<c.speaker>to make up for those deeds.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.416
<c.speaker>This way, we can
put the past behind us

02:36.416 --> 02:38.333
<c.speaker>and create a stronger
friendship.

02:38.333 --> 02:42.291
<c.speaker>I call for a vote.
All in favor of signing
the unity pact?

02:44.750 --> 02:47.000
<c.speaker>[sighs] Everyone should
have the chance

02:47.000 --> 02:50.083
<c.speaker>to atone for past mistakes.

02:50.083 --> 02:52.333
<c.speaker>I still don't think
we can trust them.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.833
<c.speaker>It's four to one.
I'll go to Coronado

02:54.833 --> 02:56.708
<c.speaker>and talk to King Pescoro today.

02:56.708 --> 02:59.833
<c.speaker>You're making a big mistake.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.000
<c.speaker>Well, it might take
a little time,

03:05.000 --> 03:06.333
<c.speaker>but she'll come around.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.458
<c.speaker>[Naomi]
No, I won't!

03:07.458 --> 03:09.125
<c.speaker>[laughs nervously]

03:16.625 --> 03:18.333
<c.speaker>-[coral alarm sounding]
-[Elena gasps]

03:18.333 --> 03:21.291
<c.speaker>Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

03:24.625 --> 03:26.375
<c.speaker>Oh, it's you.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.291
<c.speaker>Stand down! It's just
Princess Elena.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.125
<c.speaker>What was that sound?

03:31.125 --> 03:33.375
<c.speaker>One of our coral alarms.

03:33.375 --> 03:36.291
<c.speaker>It alerts us when anyone
who is not a sirena

03:36.291 --> 03:39.500
<c.speaker>or accompanied by a sirena
gets too close to Coronado.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.583
<c.speaker>And you are <i>way </i>too close!

03:41.583 --> 03:42.958
<c.speaker>I'm... sorry?

03:42.958 --> 03:44.291
<c.speaker>Why all the security?

03:44.291 --> 03:46.333
<c.speaker>Because of the malandros.

03:46.333 --> 03:48.875
<c.speaker>-Malandros?
-Nasty river dolphins

03:48.875 --> 03:50.708
<c.speaker>who want to invade
our kingdom.

03:50.708 --> 03:52.958
<c.speaker>They can shapeshift
into other creatures.

03:52.958 --> 03:55.125
<c.speaker>But maybe you know that.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.416
<c.speaker>Maybe you're one of them!

03:57.416 --> 03:58.416
<c.speaker>Hey, quit it!

03:58.416 --> 04:00.583
<c.speaker>[Daria]
Save your ink, Ocho.

04:00.583 --> 04:01.958
<c.speaker>The sound would have
driven her off

04:01.958 --> 04:04.000
<c.speaker>if she was a malandro.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.708
<c.speaker>-Good point.
-I just want to see
King Pescoro!

04:07.833 --> 04:09.416
<c.speaker>[groans]

04:09.416 --> 04:11.583
<c.speaker>[sighs] I'll escort you
to the palace.

04:11.583 --> 04:15.375
<c.speaker>But just so you know,
that milagra may let you
breathe underwater,

04:15.375 --> 04:16.458
<c.speaker>but it doesn't
give you permission

04:16.458 --> 04:19.875
<c.speaker>to drop by
anytime you like.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.458
<c.speaker>No, it doesn't! Hm!

04:25.208 --> 04:27.833
<c.speaker>[Elena]
And, I was thinking,
after we sign the pact,

04:27.833 --> 04:30.500
<c.speaker>we could have a huge feast!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.166
<c.speaker>So, what do you think?

04:32.166 --> 04:34.208
<c.speaker>With all due respect,
Your Majesty,

04:34.208 --> 04:35.625
<c.speaker>it will take more
than a big lunch

04:35.625 --> 04:37.458
<c.speaker>to make everyone
forget the past.

04:39.083 --> 04:41.291
<c.speaker>Daria raises a good point.

04:43.833 --> 04:46.250
<c.speaker>But <i>Papá, </i>we have to start
somewhere.

04:46.250 --> 04:49.583
<c.speaker>I'd finally get
to reunite with my human family.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.708
<c.speaker>Princess Elena,
are you certain all humans

04:52.708 --> 04:54.458
<c.speaker>are ready to accept us?

04:54.458 --> 04:57.375
<c.speaker>Yes! Well, almost everyone.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.416
<c.speaker>You know. Some may take
longer than others.

04:59.416 --> 05:02.166
<c.speaker>There you go! It's too soon.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.625
<c.speaker>It's never too soon
for forgiveness!
Right, <i>Mamá? </i>

05:04.625 --> 05:07.708
<c.speaker>She's right! I forgave you
for sinking my ship.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.458
<c.speaker>I will sign the unity pact!

05:12.458 --> 05:14.708
<c.speaker>-Yes!
-Thank you, <i>mi amor! </i>

05:14.708 --> 05:17.416
<c.speaker>You're making a big mistake!

05:17.416 --> 05:18.875
<c.speaker>Huge!

05:18.875 --> 05:21.125
<c.speaker>As my Reef Commander,
I'm counting on you

05:21.125 --> 05:23.458
<c.speaker>to make sure it is not.

05:23.458 --> 05:27.125
<c.speaker>Please assist Princess Elena
in arranging the feast.

05:27.125 --> 05:29.458
<c.speaker>[sighs] As you wish.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.750
<c.speaker>Great! I'll meet you
in the palace canal.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.625
<c.speaker>Let's just go right now.
Come on, Marzel!

05:33.625 --> 05:35.833
<c.speaker>What? Oh! OK!

05:35.833 --> 05:38.583
<c.speaker>From Reef Commander
to party planner!

05:38.583 --> 05:40.375
<c.speaker>That's gotta sting.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.500
<c.speaker>Not as much as this, Cuco!

05:42.500 --> 05:44.958
<c.speaker>[grunts, chuckles]
Nice try, inkspot!

05:44.958 --> 05:47.625
<c.speaker>[exclaiming]

05:47.625 --> 05:48.583
<c.speaker>[groans]

05:58.208 --> 06:01.583
<c.speaker>OK, the first thing
we need to decide is food!

06:01.583 --> 06:04.875
<c.speaker>I was thinking
<i>churrasco, paella, feijoada-- </i>

06:04.875 --> 06:08.458
<c.speaker>Sirenas only eat
seaweed and kelp.

06:09.458 --> 06:11.333
<c.speaker>Um, sure!

06:11.333 --> 06:12.625
<c.speaker>Not a problem!

06:12.625 --> 06:16.083
<c.speaker>The royal chefs are whizzes
with seaweed recipes.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.458
<c.speaker>At least, they will be soon.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.291
<c.speaker>Next, location!

06:19.291 --> 06:21.416
<c.speaker>What about Punta Luz?

06:21.416 --> 06:23.208
<c.speaker>There are some nice
tide pools there.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.208
<c.speaker>And a not-so-nice shipwreck.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.875
<c.speaker>My parents told me
about the schooner

06:26.875 --> 06:29.333
<c.speaker>you sirenas ran aground there.

06:29.333 --> 06:33.583
<c.speaker>I'm sorry. It must have been
before we were born.

06:33.583 --> 06:36.416
<c.speaker>It's also where you humans
attacked a group

06:36.416 --> 06:39.708
<c.speaker>of innocent sirenas
just last year.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.583
<c.speaker>Yeah! Last year!

06:41.583 --> 06:44.875
<c.speaker>OK, well, maybe we'll just
hold off choosing the location.

06:44.875 --> 06:49.125
<c.speaker>Better yet, why don't we
hold off on the whole
Unity Pact?

06:49.125 --> 06:51.500
<c.speaker>That's one thing
we agree on.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.708
<c.speaker>The only thing.

06:54.375 --> 06:56.625
<c.speaker>-[sighs]
-[Marzel] On the bright side,

06:56.625 --> 06:58.000
<c.speaker>we can go back
to choosing the location.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.958
<c.speaker>What about the big cove
just south of the city?

07:00.958 --> 07:02.083
<c.speaker>With the pretty rocks?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.958
<c.speaker>[gasps] La Cala Vistosa?

07:03.958 --> 07:05.416
<c.speaker>That's perfect!

07:06.583 --> 07:08.458
<c.speaker>Did you hear that, Ocho?

07:08.458 --> 07:11.875
<c.speaker>There are plenty of humans
who will <i>never </i>forget
our history.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.000
<c.speaker>I know I won't.

07:14.583 --> 07:17.583
<c.speaker>But that happened
a long time ago, Daria.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.958
<c.speaker>Well, only a fool
would trust humans!

07:19.958 --> 07:22.625
<c.speaker>They want us to sign the pact
so we let our guard down.

07:22.625 --> 07:25.625
<c.speaker>And then they'll
come after us again!

07:25.625 --> 07:29.125
<c.speaker>We have to stop King Pescoro
from signing the Unity Pact.

07:29.125 --> 07:32.583
<c.speaker>Right. And how are we
gonna do that?

07:32.583 --> 07:35.333
<c.speaker>With the help of a few
party crashers.

07:40.875 --> 07:43.375
<c.speaker>Uh, why are we going
towards the river?

07:43.375 --> 07:44.500
<c.speaker>You'll see.

07:56.625 --> 07:58.750
<c.speaker>Pay up, Mac!

07:58.750 --> 08:00.833
<c.speaker>M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-malandros?!

08:00.833 --> 08:03.708
<c.speaker>Try to keep it together,
Ocho.

08:03.708 --> 08:06.500
<c.speaker>Where do ya think
you're going, Sirena?

08:06.500 --> 08:10.208
<c.speaker>Same place you're going,
Torpe. To see Saloso.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.333
<c.speaker>No way I'm takin' you
to see... to see..

08:13.333 --> 08:14.750
<c.speaker>[sneezes]

08:16.625 --> 08:18.333
<c.speaker>[both chuckle]

08:18.333 --> 08:20.625
<c.speaker>So, seaweed makes me sneeze.

08:20.625 --> 08:22.083
<c.speaker>It's a problem.

08:22.083 --> 08:23.708
<c.speaker>If you don't bring me
to Saloso,

08:23.708 --> 08:26.625
<c.speaker>sneezing is going to be
the least of your problems.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.833
<c.speaker>I'm not bringin' you anywhere!

08:28.833 --> 08:30.458
<c.speaker>Then you leave me no choice.

08:30.458 --> 08:31.708
<c.speaker>Yeah!

08:31.708 --> 08:33.708
<c.speaker>-Get him, Ocho!
-What?

08:33.708 --> 08:34.625
<c.speaker>Aah!

08:34.625 --> 08:36.083
<c.speaker>Hey! What?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.458
<c.speaker>[sneezing]

08:38.458 --> 08:40.625
<c.speaker>Oh. You little--!

08:40.625 --> 08:44.625
<c.speaker>-[Ocho struggling]
-[Torpe] Nobody inks Torpe
and gets away with it!

08:44.625 --> 08:46.500
<c.speaker>[screams]

08:48.291 --> 08:49.333
<c.speaker>Saloso.

08:49.333 --> 08:51.333
<c.speaker>[chewing]

08:55.125 --> 08:58.625
<c.speaker>Daria.
What an unwelcome surprise.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.166
<c.speaker>For you and me both.

09:01.166 --> 09:03.583
<c.speaker>Then what are you doin' here?

09:03.583 --> 09:05.833
<c.speaker>Sirenas and malandros
have a common enemy.

09:05.833 --> 09:06.958
<c.speaker>-[hermit crab squeals]
-Humans.

09:06.958 --> 09:09.333
<c.speaker>Heh. Tell me something
I don't know.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.583
<c.speaker>That wouldn't be hard.

09:11.583 --> 09:12.958
<c.speaker>But I'll start with this.

09:12.958 --> 09:15.000
<c.speaker>King Pescoro and
the human princess

09:15.000 --> 09:17.208
<c.speaker>are signing
a Unity Pact tomorrow.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.583
<c.speaker>And why should I care
about that?

09:20.583 --> 09:22.083

<c.speaker>less than I trust you.

09:23.708 --> 09:28.958
<c.speaker>So I want you to help me
make sure the Pact isn't signed.

09:28.958 --> 09:31.000
<c.speaker>Yeah. Still not caring.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.208
<c.speaker>You care about
getting outta this dump.

09:33.208 --> 09:35.875

trying to get your fins
on our kingdom.

are you proposing?

09:45.875 --> 09:48.958
<c.speaker>If you help me out,
I'll let you have

09:50.958 --> 09:52.750
<c.speaker>Hmm.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.750

I need him to shapeshift
into a sirena

10:02.875 --> 10:05.291
<c.speaker>and you to shapeshift
into a human.

<c.speaker>[laughs]
I like this plan already.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.833
<c.speaker>As soon as he starts
singing the siren song,

10:11.833 --> 10:15.250
<c.speaker>you accuse the sirenas
of going back to their old ways.

<c.speaker>[laughs] We do that,
and the harpoons'll be
a-flyin'!

<c.speaker>Exactly.
Everyone will see

10:21.708 --> 10:24.291
<c.speaker>how the humans really feel
about sirenas.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.708

10:25.708 --> 10:28.958
<c.speaker>Don't forget to turn off
your coral alarms,

10:28.958 --> 10:30.875
<c.speaker>or we'll never make it
past your palace.

where every one

and once she shuts them off,

<c.speaker>[Ocho panting]

18:18.458 --> 18:19.708
<c.speaker>Ocho!

18:19.708 --> 18:21.416
<c.speaker>[grunting]

18:21.416 --> 18:25.583
<c.speaker>[laughs] Looks like
your luck's run out, Daria.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.583
<c.speaker>[Elena]
So has yours.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.583
<c.speaker>I'm not scared of you!

18:30.583 --> 18:31.583
<c.speaker>Blaze!

18:31.583 --> 18:33.416
<c.speaker>Whoa!

18:33.416 --> 18:34.458
<c.speaker>How 'bout now?

18:34.458 --> 18:35.875
<c.speaker>Heh. Maybe a little.

18:39.291 --> 18:40.750
<c.speaker>Don't worry. I'll get you
out of there.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.458
<c.speaker>[gasps] What are you doing?!

18:42.458 --> 18:43.833
<c.speaker>Flee while you can!

18:43.833 --> 18:45.000
<c.speaker>They'll come back with Saloso

18:45.000 --> 18:46.416
<c.speaker>and all of his guards!

18:46.416 --> 18:48.083
<c.speaker>We're not going anywhere
without you.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.458
<c.speaker>This is not your battle.
Why put yourselves at risk?

18:51.458 --> 18:54.333
<c.speaker>This is what allies do.
They protect one another.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.708
<c.speaker>[sighs] I don't deserve
your help.

18:56.708 --> 18:59.291
<c.speaker>I'm the reason
all this happened!

18:59.291 --> 19:02.333
<c.speaker>I trusted the malandros.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.125
<c.speaker>Sometimes it's hard to know
who to trust.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.708
<c.speaker>But now, you know.

19:10.166 --> 19:12.375
<c.speaker>I'm sorry, Your Highness.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.458
<c.speaker>But there's nothing
we can do now.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.000
<c.speaker>The malandros destroyed
all the coral alarms.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.875
<c.speaker>I-is there another way
to drive them off?

19:18.875 --> 19:22.333
<c.speaker>Yeah. Grow more coral alarms.
But that'll take too long.

19:22.333 --> 19:24.166
<c.speaker>Maybe not.

19:25.166 --> 19:26.458
<c.speaker>Bloom!

19:29.458 --> 19:30.458
<c.speaker>Not again!

19:30.458 --> 19:31.708
<c.speaker>Well, well.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.333
<c.speaker>What do we have here?

19:34.333 --> 19:37.291
<c.speaker>Uh, three humans,
two sirenas,

19:37.291 --> 19:38.875
<c.speaker>and a really cute octopus.

19:38.875 --> 19:40.458
<c.speaker>[groans] Just get 'em!

19:42.083 --> 19:43.333
<c.speaker>Keep working on the coral.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.083
<c.speaker>We'll hold 'em off!

19:45.083 --> 19:47.583
<c.speaker>Vetzi!

19:47.583 --> 19:49.458
<c.speaker>Bloom!

19:49.458 --> 19:50.458
<c.speaker>It's growing back!

19:50.458 --> 19:52.458
<c.speaker>Attack!

19:52.458 --> 19:54.708
<c.speaker>[grunting]

19:57.500 --> 19:58.875
<c.speaker>[grunting]

19:58.875 --> 20:01.333
<c.speaker>Prepared to get inked!
[grunts]

20:01.333 --> 20:03.375
<c.speaker>-Ha!
-[Ocho grunts]

20:03.375 --> 20:04.416
<c.speaker>Ocho! [grunts]

20:04.416 --> 20:05.416
<c.speaker>[laughs]

20:06.458 --> 20:07.458
<c.speaker>[gasps]

20:07.458 --> 20:10.291
<c.speaker>Bloom! [grunts]

20:10.291 --> 20:13.291
<c.speaker>-Elena!
-[Elena grunting]

20:15.291 --> 20:16.458
<c.speaker>[grunts] Bloom!

20:21.083 --> 20:23.125
<c.speaker>So much for that.

20:26.875 --> 20:27.958
<c.speaker>[alarm sounds]

20:27.958 --> 20:30.708
<c.speaker>-[Elena gasps]
-Ay, ow! Oh, no!

20:30.708 --> 20:33.708
<c.speaker>-[alarm continues]
-[malandros grunting]

20:33.708 --> 20:34.708
<c.speaker>The alarm's back on!

20:34.708 --> 20:36.083
<c.speaker>[grunts] No, no!

20:36.083 --> 20:37.416
<c.speaker>Make it stop!

20:40.500 --> 20:43.583
<c.speaker>Oh! This isn't over, sirenas!

20:43.583 --> 20:48.291
<c.speaker>Yeah! One of these days--
[sneezes]

20:48.291 --> 20:50.375
<c.speaker>[sneezing]

20:50.375 --> 20:52.250
<c.speaker>-[bell rings]
-Moo? [sneezes]

20:54.458 --> 20:55.875
<c.speaker>[alarm stops]

20:55.875 --> 20:57.458
<c.speaker>Elena.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.500
<c.speaker>If you still want
a Unity Pact,

20:59.500 --> 21:01.833
<c.speaker>I'll be the first one to sign.

21:01.833 --> 21:04.000
<c.speaker>And I'll provide the ink.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.416
<c.speaker>Elena! [sighs]

21:11.416 --> 21:13.625
<c.speaker>I should have gone
with you guys.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.458
<c.speaker>But I thought Marisa was lying.

21:16.458 --> 21:18.125
<c.speaker>Guess I was wrong about her.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.208
<c.speaker>Not just her.

21:21.208 --> 21:23.583
<c.speaker>The sirenas have changed.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.875
<c.speaker>I hope you're right.

21:24.875 --> 21:27.000
<c.speaker>Let's sign this Unity Pact.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.583
<c.speaker>I know some wounds
take a long time to heal.

21:30.583 --> 21:32.583
<c.speaker>Certainly longer
than one feast.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.000
<c.speaker>But we have to start somewhere.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.416
<c.speaker>I agree!

21:36.416 --> 21:38.166
<c.speaker>And I hope we all
try our best

21:38.166 --> 21:41.208
<c.speaker>to make this friendship
last forever.

21:43.166 --> 21:46.625
<c.speaker>All right! Let's break out
the kelp tacos!

21:46.625 --> 21:49.291
<c.speaker>What? They're delicious!

21:51.166 --> 21:54.000
<c.speaker>Then, let the feast resume!

21:54.000 --> 21:55.166
<c.speaker>Hear, hear!

22:03.583 --> 22:05.375
<c.speaker>[end theme playing]
