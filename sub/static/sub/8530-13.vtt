WEBVTT

00:02.083 --> 00:04.375
Hey. What are you listening to?

00:04.458 --> 00:06.959
Actually,
I'm coaching my nephew's T-ball team,

00:07.041 --> 00:09.667
so I'm listening to a book
about coaching techniques.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.250
A book?

00:11.875 --> 00:14.709
How do I get the taste
of reading out of my ears?

00:22.917 --> 00:24.250
What the heck?

00:25.417 --> 00:29.041
Kaz, Oliver, say hello to my beloved pet,

00:29.125 --> 00:30.417
Camela Anderson.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.625
Why do you have a camel?

00:35.834 --> 00:37.375
Why did you bring her to work?

00:39.041 --> 00:41.125
Everyone knows camels make the best pets.

00:41.208 --> 00:44.291
And I brought her to work
because my camel walker passed away.

00:44.375 --> 00:45.625
He was trampled by a camel.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.041
Can she do any tricks?

00:49.125 --> 00:50.792
She can sit, and I'm teaching her

00:50.875 --> 00:52.291
to pull a rabbit out of a hat.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.250
Right now,
she can pull a hat out of a rabbit,

00:54.333 --> 00:56.542
but you only wanna see that trick once.

01:02.208 --> 01:05.166
Horace, what are Wallace
and Clyde doing up from Mighty Max?

01:05.250 --> 01:06.875
I wanna let them stretch their legs

01:06.959 --> 01:08.875
before I melt them into action figures.

01:08.959 --> 01:11.125
Because no one wants
to play with action figures

01:11.208 --> 01:12.500
that have tight hamstrings.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.709
-Guys, help us.
-Yeah, you've known us for years.

01:15.792 --> 01:17.250
You can vouch for our characters.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.208
Especially
our snobby movie critic characters.

01:19.291 --> 01:23.417
I give this film one very
expensive but wilted orchid.

01:24.583 --> 01:27.041
Horace,
you can't turn them into action figures.

01:27.125 --> 01:27.959
They're our friends.

01:28.041 --> 01:29.291
-Good point.
-Listen to the kid.

01:29.375 --> 01:31.625
Yeah, our friends that tried to destroy us

01:31.709 --> 01:33.458
and take down the entire hospital.

01:33.542 --> 01:35.375
-Good counterpoint.
-We did do that.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.959
Horace, I can tell
there's still some good left in them.

01:39.041 --> 01:40.792
And I think I can rehabilitate them

01:40.875 --> 01:43.667
with the positive reinforcement techniques
I've been using to coach T-ball.

01:43.750 --> 01:45.709
If I can train a bunch of six-year-olds,

01:45.792 --> 01:47.750
I can certainly train two senior citizens.

01:50.166 --> 01:53.959
Fine. I'll grant them a temporary release

01:54.041 --> 01:55.875
to prove they're no longer evil.

01:55.959 --> 01:57.291
You have 72 hours,

01:57.375 --> 01:59.250
from the day before yesterday.

01:59.333 --> 02:01.583
So I have 24 hours?

02:02.291 --> 02:03.875
I thought I made that abundantly clear.

02:06.250 --> 02:07.375

Ha-ha, it's nice to be back.

02:56.667 --> 02:58.625
Yeah, we really miss this place.

02:59.583 --> 03:00.792
There's no money in here.

03:00.875 --> 03:02.333
Nothing's changed at all.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.458
Okay, bring it in, boys.

03:06.542 --> 03:08.750
Now, we have less than 12 hours

03:08.834 --> 03:11.291
to convince Horace that
you guys are no longer villains.

03:11.375 --> 03:12.625
We can do this!

03:12.709 --> 03:14.458
Any questions? Wallace.

03:14.542 --> 03:15.875
Yes. When do we get snacks?

03:15.959 --> 03:19.291
-I believe there was talk of juice boxes.
-Fine.

03:22.083 --> 03:24.625
Now imagine the comic book shop

03:24.709 --> 03:26.834
as our playing field,
and you two are the players.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.542
And the game is called... anyone?

03:31.125 --> 03:33.083
-Wallace.
-Clyde stole my juice box.

03:36.667 --> 03:37.709
(whistle blows)

03:37.792 --> 03:40.583
Boys, what did I say about teamwork?

03:40.667 --> 03:42.750
Nothing. You've not touched on that.

03:42.834 --> 03:44.250
Yeah, you didn't say anything.

03:44.333 --> 03:46.041
My bad. I'll get to that later.

03:47.125 --> 03:49.458
But for now, here's the game plan.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.208
You two have spent your whole lives

03:51.291 --> 03:53.208
focused on destroying superheroes.

03:53.291 --> 03:55.041
But today, I'm gonna teach you

03:55.125 --> 03:57.166
how to interact with them peacefully.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.542
I guess it won't hurt to try.

03:58.625 --> 03:59.959
Unless it will hurt to try.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.959
'Cause if it's gonna hurt,
we prefer not to try.

04:03.083 --> 04:04.917
That's what this day's all about. Effort.

04:05.000 --> 04:05.834
So we're gonna try.

04:06.417 --> 04:09.417
Wallace, Clyde, meet Blue--

04:09.500 --> 04:10.875
(screaming)

04:14.667 --> 04:18.500
Okay, that was not part of the game plan.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.250
Kaz, what are you doing?

04:34.333 --> 04:37.041
I'm tired of just helping superheroes.

04:37.125 --> 04:38.625
I want to become one myself.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.417
So I'm trying to give myself powers

04:40.500 --> 04:42.875
so I can impress
girls and be great in sports.

04:42.959 --> 04:45.792
-And save people?
-If there's time.

04:47.667 --> 04:50.458
Anyway,
I'm recreating Sonar Ninja's origin story.

04:50.542 --> 04:51.709
He was a blind archaeologist

04:51.792 --> 04:53.917
whose other senses became super powerful

04:54.000 --> 04:55.834
after he fell into a crystal cavern

04:55.917 --> 04:58.041
and the crystals
changed his brain chemistry.

04:58.125 --> 05:00.291
A blind archaeologist?

05:00.375 --> 05:02.125
No wonder he fell into a cavern.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.709
Right. To lose my vision,
I'm going to wear this blindfold,

05:05.792 --> 05:08.041
and the crystals
that I put into that helmet

05:08.125 --> 05:09.792
will mess with my brain junk.

05:20.333 --> 05:22.875
I probably should've
put the helmet on first.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.542
Here.

05:27.333 --> 05:28.417
Thank you.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.417
All right, now.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.000
Just wait for my other senses
to kick into high gear.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.583
(shouting) Is it working?

05:37.291 --> 05:39.500
Because I'm whispering right now.

05:39.583 --> 05:41.083
Can you hear me?

05:42.417 --> 05:44.542
It's almost like
you're standing right next to me

05:44.625 --> 05:47.208
screaming directly into my ear,
causing permanent damage.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.625
My super sense of smell just kicked in.

05:52.709 --> 05:56.041
I can smell rabbit poop
from the pet store miles from here.

05:56.125 --> 05:57.542
Sorry, that's me.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.917
My camel just pulled
this hat out of a rabbit.

06:01.834 --> 06:02.917
Ugh!

06:09.917 --> 06:11.625
Wallace, Clyde, come on out.

06:11.709 --> 06:13.125
Let's see some hustle.

06:13.208 --> 06:15.667
When you say hustle,
do you mean hustle as in hurry up,

06:15.750 --> 06:17.583
or hustle as in the '70s dance craze?

06:17.667 --> 06:19.709
Because we can only do the second one.

06:19.792 --> 06:25.875
(disco music plays)

06:25.959 --> 06:27.208
Wow. Loud.

06:27.291 --> 06:29.667
Okay. Good hustle.

06:31.041 --> 06:33.125
You guys have made great progress

06:33.208 --> 06:35.208
but Horace is on his way, so...

06:35.291 --> 06:37.083
let me show you the game plan.

06:37.166 --> 06:40.208
Horace will enter from over here.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.417
You two will enter from over here.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.875
Why did you need to draw that?

06:45.959 --> 06:48.041
And why are we all naked?

06:49.500 --> 06:51.583
'Cause I'm really bad at drawing clothes.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.750
Horace, thanks for coming.

06:55.834 --> 06:58.375
Wait until you see how totally reformed
Wallace and Clyde are.

06:58.458 --> 07:00.834
Okay. But I want you to know,

07:00.917 --> 07:04.000
I've come prepared in case
there's any monkey business.

07:08.208 --> 07:09.375
What's with the banana?

07:09.458 --> 07:11.625
How else would you conduct
business with a monkey?

07:13.542 --> 07:17.458
Anyway, I'm very skeptical
about Wallace and Clyde.

07:17.542 --> 07:19.917
You'll see. Wallace, Clyde,

07:20.583 --> 07:23.125
let's show Horace the new you.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.250
Where did you get
a real ball of disintegration?

07:29.333 --> 07:31.959
This is one of Wallace
and Clyde's old weapons.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.166
I'm gonna have 'em tie us up,

07:33.250 --> 07:34.875
I'm gonna leave it here on the table

07:34.959 --> 07:37.208
and when they resist
the temptation to disintegrate you,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.041
you'll know they aren't evil anymore.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.083
That sounds like a great plan.

07:41.166 --> 07:42.542
What, you don't like it?

07:42.625 --> 07:44.500
I'm sorry. That came out sarcastic.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.250
That sounds like a great plan!

07:58.834 --> 08:00.333
What are you staring at?

08:04.375 --> 08:06.208
I honestly have no idea.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.417
I'm trying to get super powers
the way Remix did.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.000
She used skin cream
with radioactive yak's milk

08:14.083 --> 08:16.291
that combined
with an electric charge from her guitar.

08:16.375 --> 08:17.875
Well, I can't afford

08:17.959 --> 08:19.750
her expensive yak's milk skin cream,

08:19.834 --> 08:22.917
and I couldn't find a yak,
so I did the only logical thing.

08:23.000 --> 08:25.333
Borrowed Philip's pet camel
and milked her instead.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.083
Now, to irradiate the milk.

08:32.166 --> 08:33.417
Okay.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.500
Uh-oh, she's eating that medicine.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.709
Is it harmful?

08:37.792 --> 08:39.250
I don't know. Let's see.

08:41.417 --> 08:44.959
"Do not use if pregnant,
driving, or a camel."

08:50.375 --> 08:52.792
Oh. I think someone's pregnant.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.166
See, we're totally helpless,

09:05.250 --> 09:07.917
and Wallace and Clyde are totally fine.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.500
Why they're brushing each other's hair,
I have no idea.

09:12.709 --> 09:14.917
I'm still not convinced.

09:15.792 --> 09:19.083
Oliver,
did I ever tell you the funny story

09:19.166 --> 09:21.208
of how I defeated Catastrophe

09:21.291 --> 09:23.458
and turned him
into the two pathetic creatures

09:23.542 --> 09:24.792
you see before you?

09:24.875 --> 09:27.375
Now, the old Wallace and Clyde

09:27.458 --> 09:30.291
would've reacted
by destroying you in a furious rage,

09:30.375 --> 09:32.208
but watch what
the new Wallace and Clyde do.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.125
That wasn't what we trained for,

09:39.208 --> 09:41.083
but it is harmless.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.291
Creepy but harmless.

09:44.625 --> 09:46.250
Creepy but harmless.

09:46.333 --> 09:49.458
That's how I describe
myself on my dating profile.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.458
Well done, Oliver.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.834
Wallace and Clyde, you're free men.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.417
(both) Yes!

09:56.500 --> 09:57.875
Congratulations, boys.

09:57.959 --> 10:00.000
And as a reward for a job well done,

10:00.083 --> 10:01.959
I have a little surprise for you.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.250
Mini cheesecakes.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.250
My T-ball kids love these.

10:06.333 --> 10:09.959
They also love eating their own boogers,
so these might not actually be that good.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.458
You disintegrated Horace. What happened?

10:18.291 --> 10:20.834
-Wallace.
-Clyde stole my mini cheesecake.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.458
I cannot believe you disintegrated Horace.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.208
We didn't do it.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.291
You left the room,
and things went all fuzzy.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.375
-Including our hair.
-You have a little bit...

10:34.458 --> 10:35.834
(both speak at the same time)

10:35.917 --> 10:37.500
Would you stop with the hair?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.458
If you didn't disintegrate Horace,

10:40.542 --> 10:43.458
-then who did?
-Hey, a note.

10:45.208 --> 10:46.959
Maybe it's a clue.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.709
No, it's a to-do list.

10:50.375 --> 10:52.125
"Renew exterminator's license.

10:52.208 --> 10:54.166
Pick up Laughy Cat T-shirt
from the dry cleaners.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.417
Buy giant glue trap for Horace Diaz.

10:57.500 --> 10:59.000
Frame Wallace and Clyde."

10:59.083 --> 11:00.667
I can't believe it.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.333
Yeah. Who dry cleans a T-shirt?

11:05.500 --> 11:07.792
I meant,
we were framed by the Exterminator.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.375
You're right.
It's obvious what happened here.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.041
The Exterminator
was spying on us from outside.

11:14.959 --> 11:17.208
The moment you left
to get your mini cheesecakes,

11:17.291 --> 11:19.000
he made his move.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.875
(Oliver) Wait, wait.

11:20.959 --> 11:22.542
Why are you wearing tuxedoes?

11:22.625 --> 11:24.542
It's our re-enactment.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.166
We can wear whatever we want.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.041
Yeah, that's the rule of re-enactments.

11:30.417 --> 11:33.542
When you left the room,
the Exterminator snuck in.

11:33.625 --> 11:36.083
He blasted us with his neuralizer toxin,

11:36.166 --> 11:38.250
abducted Horace Diaz,

11:38.333 --> 11:41.375
and made it look
like we disintegrated him.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.709
My goodness, even unconscious,

11:46.792 --> 11:48.458
those two are the handsomest,

11:48.542 --> 11:50.417
most well-dressed
twin comic book store owners

11:50.500 --> 11:51.542
I've ever seen.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.583
He didn't say that.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.917
-He might've said that.
-You weren't there.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.291
So Horace might still be alive.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.834
You guys used to be villains,
so you know how they think.

12:04.917 --> 12:06.875
Where would the Exterminator
have taken Horace?

12:06.959 --> 12:08.625
To his lair, most likely.

12:08.709 --> 12:10.291
It's in the downtown lair district.

12:10.375 --> 12:12.125
It's the hot new place to have your lair.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.750
We have to sneak in and save Horace.

12:15.834 --> 12:17.750
The Exterminator is ruthless,

12:18.458 --> 12:20.333
but we have the element of surprise.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.000
So we just need to be totally stealth.

12:27.041 --> 12:28.709
(slurping loudly)

12:30.458 --> 12:33.208
Sorry. Breaking and entering
makes me very thirsty.

12:33.291 --> 12:34.667
You know what makes me thirsty?

12:34.750 --> 12:36.041
You stealing my juice box.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.875
Quiet! The Exterminator will hear us.

12:39.959 --> 12:41.667
I didn't hear them,

12:42.291 --> 12:43.709
but I did hear you.

12:43.792 --> 12:46.083
It's true, Oliver. You're very loud.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.458
Kaz, have you seen Camela Anderson?

12:58.542 --> 13:01.083
I can't fall asleep until she says...

13:01.166 --> 13:02.417
(imitates camel roar)

13:07.959 --> 13:11.083
Uh, she told me she was going over to...

13:11.166 --> 13:12.917
(imitates camel roar)

13:13.834 --> 13:14.834
Silly camel.

13:14.917 --> 13:18.000
I specifically told her,
don't go over to (roars).

13:20.166 --> 13:23.083
Kaz, I came up
with a way for you to recreate

13:23.166 --> 13:25.583
Cricket Man's origin story and get powers.

13:25.667 --> 13:27.959
I thought you said my plan was stupid.

13:28.041 --> 13:30.333
I did, but if by some miracle it works,

13:30.417 --> 13:32.291
then I can do the same thing
to get powers.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.792
Come on, we have nothing to lose.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.083
Actually, you could lose an arm,

13:37.166 --> 13:38.375
or an eye.

13:38.458 --> 13:40.834
But I have nothing to lose.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.834
So you wanna use me as a guinea pig?

13:44.792 --> 13:47.041
Awesome. Yeah, guinea pigs are the best.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.166
They're all, like,

13:50.458 --> 13:53.250
well, I don't really know
what sound a guinea pig makes,

13:53.333 --> 13:56.375
but camels are like... (roars).

13:57.166 --> 13:58.458
Camela!

13:58.542 --> 14:01.834
Oh, sorry. That was me.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.959
Anyway, this is a positron emitter.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.166
I'm going to use it
to irradiate this cricket,

14:10.250 --> 14:13.250
and have it bite your hand,
which will give you super cricket powers.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.208
Like the power to...

14:16.291 --> 14:17.917
bug someone?

14:19.000 --> 14:21.125
(cricket chirping)

14:21.208 --> 14:23.709
Be quiet. Nobody asked for your opinion.

14:33.083 --> 14:34.291
It's working.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.417
You know,
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.834
I really do value your opinion.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.458
(roars)

15:09.333 --> 15:11.750
You know what would
really come in handy right now?

15:11.834 --> 15:13.083
A laser camel.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.333
How did you figure out I had Diaz?

15:24.417 --> 15:25.959
We found your to-do list.

15:26.041 --> 15:27.041
And you know what?

15:28.083 --> 15:30.917
This Laughy Cat T-shirt actually
does look a lot better dry cleaned.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.250
-Right?
-Yeah.

15:33.750 --> 15:35.375
Why did you abduct Horace?

15:35.458 --> 15:37.291
I thought you'd given up
on being a villain,

15:37.375 --> 15:39.041
and you have a legitimate business.

15:39.125 --> 15:41.291
You put an ad in our high school yearbook.

15:41.375 --> 15:45.000
I was trying to frame Wallace and Clyde
and ruin their lives.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.792
Is this about the time
I invited you to the Domain

15:47.875 --> 15:49.917
because we were trying
to convince Clyde to turn good?

15:50.000 --> 15:51.792
You thought
it was a surprise party for you,

15:51.875 --> 15:53.458
but it wasn't because nobody likes you.

15:54.583 --> 15:56.875
Yes, that was exactly one year ago today,

15:56.959 --> 16:00.125
and once again, it is my birthday,

16:00.208 --> 16:02.583
which... hang on.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.333
Did you...

16:05.000 --> 16:07.125
Is this a surprise party for me?

16:08.041 --> 16:10.834
(all) Yes!

16:10.917 --> 16:12.417
It is.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.917
And here are the refreshments.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.083
(laughing nervously)

16:16.166 --> 16:18.333
You guys are the best.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.959
(slurping)

16:21.834 --> 16:23.500
This is empty!

16:23.583 --> 16:26.750
And you know I love frazzleberry.

16:29.709 --> 16:32.083
Actually, there's a little bit left.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.208
This isn't a party.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.083
And this is exactly
what you did last year.

16:36.166 --> 16:39.625
You ruined my life by bringing out
the super villain in me.

16:39.709 --> 16:43.375
That is when I started
planning my revenge.

16:44.625 --> 16:47.083
I was spying on Wallace and Clyde.

16:47.166 --> 16:50.000
The moment you left, I made my move.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.250
(Oliver) Hold on.

16:52.208 --> 16:54.000
Pretty sure that's not what happened.

16:55.333 --> 16:56.542
This is my re-enactment.

16:56.625 --> 16:58.166
I get to do whatever I want.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.834
When you left the room,

17:02.917 --> 17:05.792
I blasted everyone
with my neuralizer toxin,

17:05.875 --> 17:08.250
abducted Horace, and then,

17:08.333 --> 17:11.500
made it look like
Wallace disintegrated him.

17:15.125 --> 17:17.500
Okay, my dear,
let's go back to my mansion,

17:17.583 --> 17:19.709
and feed each other nachos.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.875
(Oliver) Wait.

17:29.959 --> 17:32.291
Why would you put
such an embarrassing moment

17:32.375 --> 17:34.166
in your own re-enactment?

17:35.041 --> 17:37.458
Still a lot better than real life.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.417
In real life, I had to walk home,

17:39.500 --> 17:41.709
'cause someone stole my bicycle.

17:43.542 --> 17:47.000
Listen, Exterminator, we're sorry that
we turned you into a super villain again.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.917
Plus, we didn't know that
was your bike when we stole it.

17:50.792 --> 17:53.500
I'm glad you guys tracked me here.

17:53.583 --> 17:56.583
'Cause now, I get to watch you suffer

17:56.667 --> 17:58.625
while I exterminate you.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.458
Get me off this glue trap
so I can use my power

18:04.542 --> 18:06.208
to immobilize the Exterminator.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.417
Okay.

18:11.792 --> 18:13.750
Oh, no.

18:18.208 --> 18:19.291
Come on.

18:25.542 --> 18:27.291
(gun powers down)

18:30.166 --> 18:33.125
Wait. You have the ball
of disintegration. Use it.

18:37.583 --> 18:39.583
Don't, don't. No, guys. Guys, guys.

18:39.667 --> 18:41.583
Hey, why are we fighting each other?

18:41.667 --> 18:43.917
Horace Diaz is the real enemy.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.041
Okay, so unlock your true evil natures

18:47.125 --> 18:49.041
and destroy him, not me.

18:51.041 --> 18:52.208
Yeah!

18:52.291 --> 18:54.291
Wallace, Clyde, listen to me.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.750
If you disintegrate Horace,

18:56.500 --> 18:58.500
you will not get
your participation medals.

19:00.583 --> 19:01.959
Do it!

19:07.917 --> 19:09.083
No!

19:11.667 --> 19:13.250
You disintegrated the trap.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.417
Good heads-up play, guys.
I knew you'd make the right decision.

19:16.500 --> 19:18.166
And I have something for you.

19:22.208 --> 19:23.333
Where's my medal?

19:23.417 --> 19:24.667
I participated.

19:26.125 --> 19:27.667
I don't have one here,

19:27.750 --> 19:29.959
but you can have one in your re-enactment.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.542
What's the matter?

19:42.625 --> 19:45.500
In my re-enactment, Clyde stole my medal.

19:55.083 --> 19:56.542
We need to find the laser camel

19:56.625 --> 19:58.875
and the giant cricket
before they destroy the hospital.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.458
Or mate, 'cause that would be weird.

20:04.792 --> 20:07.709
Philip, you found Camela.

20:07.792 --> 20:12.000
In perfect health,
totally the same as always.

20:13.125 --> 20:15.166
Actually, she's not the same,

20:15.250 --> 20:17.250
and I think you had
something to do with it.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.458
Watch this.

20:23.750 --> 20:26.000
See? She can lie down now.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.125
Isn't that the most amazing thing
you've ever seen?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.375
Okay, you're probably wondering why

20:41.458 --> 20:43.959
she can shoot lasers out of her nostrils.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.792
Not at all. She does that all the time.

20:46.667 --> 20:49.792
-What?
-She's a laser camel.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.458
That's why I got her.

20:51.542 --> 20:55.583
I mean, what kind of weirdo
has a regular camel for a pet?

21:11.333 --> 21:12.875
Good job, Camela.

21:12.959 --> 21:16.875
You deserve a nice, big bag of (roars).

21:24.041 --> 21:25.709
I can give you an estimate,

21:25.792 --> 21:28.125
but we're lookin' at big numbers.

21:33.041 --> 21:35.625
(theme music plays)

21:57.000 --> 21:58.208
(boing)

22:01.959 --> 22:03.041
(boy) Yes!
