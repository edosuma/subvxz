right now, huh?

04:06.846 --> 04:09.782
[glass ringing]

04:12.385 --> 04:14.854
So I'm not that
good at giving toasts

04:14.854 --> 04:18.690
So I thought I'd
just tell a story.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.428
I was seven so Crew
must have been 15 or so?

04:23.796 --> 04:27.967
So I get on my bike and I
follow Crew to the theater,

04:27.967 --> 04:30.970
and there he is
standing outside,

04:31.871 --> 04:35.875
and all of a sudden this
girl comes up out of nowhere

04:35.875 --> 04:40.647
and she gives him this big
hug, and it made me so mad.

04:41.981 --> 04:44.350
I thought to myself,
"Who is this girl,

04:44.350 --> 04:45.585
"and why does she think she can

04:45.585 --> 04:48.721
"just come up and
hug my brother?"

04:48.721 --> 04:50.423
So naturally I'm gonna
go up and I'm gonna

04:50.423 --> 04:52.492
punch her in the face, right?

04:52.492 --> 04:53.960
[laughter]

04:53.960 --> 04:57.764
And then I saw the look
on my brother's face.

04:57.764 --> 05:01.067
He was so happy, he
was literally glowing.

05:02.902 --> 05:05.972
I had never seen
him look like that.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.878
Now this would be a great story

05:11.878 --> 05:16.949
if I could tell you that that
girl was Sara, but it wasn't,

05:19.886 --> 05:21.721
and it would be an
even better story

05:21.721 --> 05:24.023
if I could tell you
that I see that look

05:24.023 --> 05:27.860
on Crew's face all the
time now, but I don't,

05:31.064 --> 05:34.967
because the look I see on
Crew's face now when he's

05:34.967 --> 05:39.405
with Sara so surpasses that
look it's not even funny.

05:41.074 --> 05:42.809
I thought I knew
what it looked like

05:42.809 --> 05:46.045
to see my brother
happy, but I didn't.

05:47.380 --> 05:48.715
Not until Sara.

05:51.084 --> 05:56.022
I am wishing you a long life
of love, happiness and joy,

05:59.025 --> 06:01.961
and I know that our parents
are looking down on us

06:01.961 --> 06:04.964
and they're so
proud of you Crew,

06:06.132 --> 06:09.836
and they would
absolutely love Sara.

06:09.836 --> 06:10.737

06:11.804 --> 06:13.005
And if you think
I'm doing this again

06:13.005 --> 06:14.774
at your wedding you're
kidding yourself.

07:12.832 --> 07:14.534
I was kinda worried
there for a minute.

07:14.534 --> 07:17.036
[Brie] You think
they're convinced?

07:17.036 --> 07:18.104
Her?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.005
Yeah.

I don't wanna hear any
prenuptial copulation tonight.

Oh you don't have
to worry about that.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.495

an absolute gentleman.

Is that so?

08:18.097 --> 08:19.832

old fashioned.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.200
To the contrary.

Being a gentleman is
always in fashion.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.070
Oh.

Cute.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.510
When are you moving in Sara?

08:30.510 --> 08:33.645
[Sara] Not until
after the wedding.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.153
I made you something.

08:43.623 --> 08:44.524
Oh, wow.

08:46.125 --> 08:47.026
Thank you.

You know that's so funny,
Crew gave me one of these

08:50.062 --> 08:52.298
the first night we met.

Really?

Looks like the night's
just getting started.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.047
[Sara] You gotta teach
me how to make these.

It's not that hard.

a big fake smile on my face

10:22.989 --> 10:26.726

with this when I'm not.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.394
Brie.

10:29.228 --> 10:31.364
He's gonna marry Sara.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.100
Nothing you can say or
do is gonna change that.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.002
So why can't you just
be happy for him?

10:36.002 --> 10:39.972
Because she's a lying
manipulative two-faced bitch,

10:39.972 --> 10:41.974
and he deserves better.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.711
She's not a bitch,

10:45.711 --> 10:49.348
and even if she was it
isn't your decision.

10:52.752 --> 10:56.355
Yeah well, I don't
have to condone it.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.724
Yes you do, he's our brother.

10:58.724 --> 10:59.892
Not anymore.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.329
Not since he replaced me.

11:05.698 --> 11:07.900
He replaced all of us.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.803
He's not replacing anyone.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.238
So what if he's getting married,

11:12.238 --> 11:14.907
he's still our brother
no matter what.

go see that guy.

look at the one

11:53.879 --> 11:55.948

That's pleasant.

dot dress standing over me?

root of your nightmares

is your unresolved
relationship with Sara.

will disappear completely.

21:26.852 --> 21:30.856
I really think that you
should move in with me Sara.

21:30.856 --> 21:34.993
It's not good for you to
be here all on your own.

21:39.464 --> 21:42.934
Look I'm literally five
minutes down the street,

21:42.934 --> 21:46.471
I can bring you back
here anytime you want.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.041
Will you just do me a
favor and think about it?

21:49.041 --> 21:49.941
Please?

23:36.915 --> 23:37.816

[patient mumbling]

23:42.821 --> 23:45.657
Brie, Brie come on now, Brie!

23:45.657 --> 23:46.591
Brie, wait!

23:46.591 --> 23:48.160
Wait, come on now just stop!

25:59.157 --> 26:00.859
Sorry Doc.

26:00.859 --> 26:04.029
Not dealing with
your shit today Brie.

26:04.029 --> 26:08.266
[low ominous music]
[projector clicking]

27:06.725 --> 27:07.626
Jess?

27:18.837 --> 27:19.838
Jess?

27:19.838 --> 27:20.672
[Jess] What?

27:20.672 --> 27:22.240
[Brie] Hey it's me.

27:22.240 --> 27:23.908
Brie?

27:23.908 --> 27:26.144
[Brie] I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to scare you.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.979
What are you doing here?

27:27.979 --> 27:31.816
[Brie] I didn't
know where else to go.

27:31.816 --> 27:32.817
I'm scared.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.121
He's after me.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.289
Who?

27:38.289 --> 27:39.391
Crew.

27:40.959 --> 27:42.761
He's trying to kill me.

27:42.761 --> 27:43.995
[Jess] Brie.

27:43.995 --> 27:47.232
He just appears,
like outta nowhere,

27:47.232 --> 27:49.034
and it's becoming more frequent.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.770
I don't know what to do
Jessie, he's trying to kill me.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.805
Brie, Crew is dead.

27:53.805 --> 27:54.439
[Brie] He's trying to--

27:54.439 --> 27:56.041
You know that.

27:58.009 --> 28:02.180
Look he attacked me in the
hospital, that's why I ran.

28:08.086 --> 28:10.889
Please don't look
at me like that.

28:10.889 --> 28:11.723
Like what?

28:11.723 --> 28:13.258
Like I'm crazy.

28:13.258 --> 28:16.428
I'm not crazy, he attacked
me in the hospital, look!

28:16.428 --> 28:19.364
Look at my neck, he
tried to strangle me!

28:19.364 --> 28:22.400
Would I have marks on
my neck if I was crazy?

28:22.400 --> 28:25.470
You know that
Crew is dead, right?

28:27.338 --> 28:28.239
Yeah.

28:29.474 --> 28:30.742
Okay good.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.411
So now that we both
agree, that means

28:33.411 --> 28:36.481
you're probably
still hallucinating.

28:39.951 --> 28:44.255
If I was hallucinating why
would I have marks on my neck?

28:44.255 --> 28:47.992
I don't know, maybe
you did them yourself.

28:49.094 --> 28:50.762
We all lost a bit of
our sanity that night,

28:50.762 --> 28:52.230
how could we not?

28:55.366 --> 28:57.736
And what we went through,

28:59.304 --> 29:02.307
nobody should ever have
to go through that.

29:02.307 --> 29:05.410
I want you to come home,
but when you're ready

29:05.410 --> 29:07.312
and when you're healed.

29:07.312 --> 29:09.748
It's not that much longer.

29:12.117 --> 29:15.120
I don't wanna go
back there Jess.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.661
No.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.532
Is this for a friend
or a girlfriend?

31:43.167 --> 31:44.135
A friend.

31:48.573 --> 31:50.008
Goes nicely with your eyes.

31:50.008 --> 31:52.143
[chuckles]

31:52.143 --> 31:54.946
Ah, yeah she'd
never go for patterns.

31:54.946 --> 31:56.648
Gotcha, no patterns.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.685
What would you wear?

32:02.220 --> 32:06.291
That depends on where
I'm going, and with who.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.259
How about,

32:10.461 --> 32:12.397
me, dinner?

32:15.533 --> 32:18.569
Well then I wouldn't
wear anything from here.

32:18.569 --> 32:21.439
I like to be a little more
daring on first dates.

32:21.439 --> 32:23.708
[chuckles]

32:23.708 --> 32:25.310
You got a pen?

32:26.377 --> 32:27.278
Sure.

32:29.247 --> 32:31.716
[gentle music]

32:33.551 --> 32:35.286
Oh, you dropped this.

32:35.286 --> 32:36.187
Thanks.

32:45.430 --> 32:46.397
It's a fox.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.133
That's cute.

Brie, it's okay I'm here.

34:00.071 --> 34:01.305
[Brie] Oh God I'm sorry.

34:01.305 --> 34:02.673
Want some water?

34:04.642 --> 34:07.812
No it's okay,
I'll get it myself.

[Brie] He's gonna come back.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.511
We can't both be
hallucinating the same thing,

36:53.511 --> 36:54.445
this person's real.

36:54.445 --> 36:55.346
I know!

36:56.747 --> 36:58.883
He's real so who is it?

37:01.552 --> 37:02.954
[Brie] I don't know.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.623
Well why don't we
go to Doctor Sprague?

37:05.623 --> 37:10.528
We'll tell her what's going
on, maybe she can help.

37:10.528 --> 37:12.697
What if it's her?

37:12.697 --> 37:14.365
No it can't be.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.934
Why, because she's a doctor?

37:18.536 --> 37:21.772
I mean somebody knew
where to find me.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.945
I'm sorry I didn't
believe you before.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.817
It's okay, I didn't
believe me either.

37:35.319 --> 37:37.622

birds, dragons,

41:08.065 --> 41:11.035
anyway, thank you, I love it.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.503
