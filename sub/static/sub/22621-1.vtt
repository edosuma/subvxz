00:24.120 --> 00:26.520
- Stop it! Give it!
- My hair looks such a mess.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.160
- Give it back!
- Total mess.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.360
Okay, be quick!

00:29.400 --> 00:31.240
- I'’ll drop you off quickly.
- Stop it!

00:31.280 --> 00:32.760
No hugs, no kisses.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.320
Baby on board, arsehole!

00:40.440 --> 00:41.800
Why do we even need them?

00:41.840 --> 00:44.800
Why do they need to slow
people down, it'’s ridiculous?!

00:49.080 --> 00:50.760
Go on, you'’re
supposed to do it there,

00:50.800 --> 00:52.560
that'’s what they're there for.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.200
That'’s why they plant them.

00:55.120 --> 00:56.560
Don'’t do that! Don't do that!

00:56.600 --> 00:57.680
Marie! Hi, at last.

00:58.480 --> 01:00.600
Can you, no,
my hands-free isn'’t working.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.496
Listen, can you...
put me on the phone too, and...

01:02.520 --> 01:03.880
Can you give Andrew a message?

01:03.920 --> 01:06.200
Could you just tell him
that I'’m running a bit late.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.520
I'’ve got to drop
my kids off at school.

01:09.280 --> 01:10.280
What, my kids? Yeah.

01:11.880 --> 01:13.560
A boy and a girl.
Listen, I can'’t,

01:13.600 --> 01:15.520
I can'’t talk now,
Marie, okay, bye.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.200
Give me the Bop It.

01:19.240 --> 01:21.600
Give me the Bop It.
Give me the Bop It.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.240
Someone'’s in a hurry,
aren'’t they.

01:25.720 --> 01:26.760
What?

01:26.800 --> 01:28.400
What is this? What is this?

01:28.880 --> 01:30.000
What?

01:36.320 --> 01:38.160
Coming, nothing's there.
There'’s nothing here,

01:38.200 --> 01:39.200
no hole, no road works!

01:39.240 --> 01:40.560
No traffic jam, nothing's here!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.000
Why are you here?!

01:42.040 --> 01:43.800
Why are you here?

01:44.720 --> 01:46.480
Okay, I'’m going to go,
I'’m going to go.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.240
I'm going to fucking go.

02:00.720 --> 02:02.600
Can you... I'’m sorry!

02:02.640 --> 02:03.840
Can you move back?

02:04.520 --> 02:05.640
Sorry...

02:05.680 --> 02:07.280
I'm so sorry. Can you go back?

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
Just reverse!

02:08.920 --> 02:09.960
Move!

02:10.000 --> 02:11.400
Go back, just go back!

02:11.720 --> 02:13.440
Stop it, just stop it!

02:23.000 --> 02:24.080
Come on, faster!

02:31.800 --> 02:32.800
Come on, quickly.

02:32.840 --> 02:34.520
In we go. In, in.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.256
Okay, which is your classroom?
No, it'’s not that one.

02:42.280 --> 02:43.320
Hello?

02:44.520 --> 02:47.400
Hello! Hello Ivy, hello James.
Sorry, you are?

02:47.920 --> 02:48.840
I'’m Julia, I'm their mum.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.200
Oh, of course.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.400
- Have you got an appointment?
- No!

02:52.440 --> 02:53.600
I'’m just here to...

02:57.040 --> 02:58.640
Did you forget it was half term?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
No.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.640
The children are
in their school uniforms.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.000
Yeah...

03:06.040 --> 03:07.600
That'’s because
they'’re going to a...

03:08.480 --> 03:12.120
A back-to-school
disco/children themed party.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.080
Are you here to see Mrs. Lawson?

03:16.000 --> 03:18.200
- Who?
- The Headmistress.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
Yes.

03:21.400 --> 03:22.416
Yes, that'’s why I'm here.
That'’s what I'd like to do.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.480
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.800
Ivy didn'’t mention anything
about being bullied.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.280
That'’s classic victim behavior.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.600
Who'’s doing this?

03:36.920 --> 03:37.920
Leo Martin.

03:38.280 --> 03:39.800
Leo Martin?

03:41.400 --> 03:43.080
But you know he'’s five?

03:43.120 --> 03:44.120
Yes.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.840
Yes, my understanding
is that he...

03:48.440 --> 03:49.720
is an evil...

03:51.120 --> 03:52.320
child prodigy type.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.360
Let me speak to Leo'’s teacher.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.600
- Please do.
- Janet?

03:58.520 --> 04:00.880
Oh, Leo'’s teacher,
you are Leo'’s teacher.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.200
Listen to this, Leo Martin.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.480
Leo?
Has something happened to him?

04:04.520 --> 04:06.920
No, no,
he'’s been bullying little Ivy.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.200
Bullying?

04:08.640 --> 04:10.720
Well, what kind of bullying?

04:11.080 --> 04:13.400
Mind games.

04:13.800 --> 04:16.960
Overtly condescending,
tapping into her insecurities.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.720
I think he said some things
about her online.

04:23.920 --> 04:25.080
So what'’s going on now?

04:25.120 --> 04:26.360
Calling Leo'’s mum.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.096
Don'’t worry, we will get
to the bottom of this.

04:28.120 --> 04:29.120
Go for it.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.440
Do you know what,
I just, I think...

04:40.280 --> 04:42.056
I think I should just check
the facts with Ivy,

04:42.080 --> 04:43.240
because now I think of it,

04:43.280 --> 04:45.400
she can be
a little untrustworthy

04:45.840 --> 04:47.520
and manipulative herself.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.000
Thank you so much for this.

04:54.240 --> 04:55.800
My God, it'’s like a weight off.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.080
I already feel so much better
about it already.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.800
Thank you. Thank you.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.080
Actually, while I'’m here,

05:04.120 --> 05:06.280
are there any clubs
on this half term?

05:06.320 --> 05:07.800
Chess, Latin?

05:08.200 --> 05:10.200
I just don'’t like them
to switch off.

05:10.240 --> 05:12.480
Is there anything
happening today, like now?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.000
Is there anything
happening right now?

05:16.800 --> 05:19.040
Okay kids, forget school,
we'’re not doing school.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.080
Right.

05:23.800 --> 05:24.800
Okay.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.240
Two minutes,
two minutes, I'’ll be back.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.240
Mum?

05:41.120 --> 05:42.120
Mum?!

05:42.400 --> 05:43.600
Oh my God!

05:45.800 --> 05:46.960
I can see you!

05:47.000 --> 05:48.080
I know you'’re in there,

05:48.120 --> 05:49.760
hiding behind the sofa.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.000
Mother!

05:55.000 --> 05:57.440
- Mother!
- Julia, is that you?

05:57.480 --> 05:58.800
Yes, it'’s me.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.480
Were you hiding?

06:03.600 --> 06:06.400
No, I was having a lie down.

06:07.520 --> 06:08.600
Behind the sofa?

06:10.000 --> 06:11.400
I had a fall.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.216
Why are you acting like you'’re
90 years old or something?

06:14.240 --> 06:15.280
Ah, right.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.120
I see. Yeah, nice, yeah!
They really suit you.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.800
So when did you get back
from your cruise?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.160
- Yesterday.
- That'’s funny,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.160
because Paul saw you
in Waitrose on Saturday.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.400
Oh, I must still be
on Caribbean time.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.776
You'’re here, that's the thing.
I'’ll get the kids.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.160
Julia... Julia!

06:32.200 --> 06:33.200
What?

06:33.240 --> 06:34.560
- We talked about this.
- What?

06:34.600 --> 06:36.600
I'’m not doing it any more,
I can'’t.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.280
I love them to bits, but
I can'’t look after them anymore.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.296
I thought that'’s what
the holiday was for, I thought...

06:44.320 --> 06:45.360
No.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
No.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.320
In fact, the holiday made me
even more certain.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.360
- After my lung collapsed...
- It didn'’t collapse.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.560
My lung did collapse!

06:53.600 --> 06:55.440
Okay, I'’m not having
this argument again.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.960
If you'’re really serious
about this,

06:57.000 --> 07:00.600
how about we think about
starting that in the new year,

07:01.040 --> 07:04.800
and we can work out a way
of getting you some free time?

07:04.840 --> 07:06.520
- No Julia, from now.
- Okay.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.400
- What about next month?
- No, now, Julia.

07:09.440 --> 07:11.000
Starting from now.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
Okay.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.200
- I'’m sorry.
- No, no, no

07:22.800 --> 07:24.760
No,
I haven'’t got time for sorry.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.960
Unless it'’s sorry,
I'’ve changed my mind. Is it?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.200
- No.
- Right!

07:28.240 --> 07:29.680
I haven'’t got time for sorry.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.280
No.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.480
No, I haven'’t got time for that.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.920
You know it was your idea
to have grandchildren, Mother!

07:49.720 --> 07:50.960
What about Helinka?

07:51.000 --> 07:53.280
She'’s a cleaner,
she'’s not a baby-sitter.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.600
Anyway,
I really don'’t trust Helinka.

07:55.640 --> 07:56.840
I'’m almost certain it was her

07:56.880 --> 07:58.080
that ate my Easter egg.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.440
Why don'’t we
have a nanny, again?

07:59.880 --> 08:01.000
What? No, I'’ve told you...

08:02.840 --> 08:05.121
I really want the children
to be brought up the way I was,

08:05.320 --> 08:06.440
by my mother.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.760
What can I get you?

08:07.800 --> 08:09.840
Look, I'’ve got to go,
let'’s talk more later.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.800
What am I going to do
the rest of the week?

08:11.840 --> 08:13.720
You know, I work too, you know!

08:14.000 --> 08:16.200
There'’s this Peter Mandelson
thing on Thursday!

08:16.240 --> 08:17.800
I know, and listen,

08:17.840 --> 08:20.200
whatever you decide,
I am right behind you.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
Paul!

08:23.800 --> 08:25.480
Paul! Paul!

08:26.240 --> 08:28.400
Oh, you go ahead,
I haven'’t decided yet.

08:28.440 --> 08:31.120
Thanks. I'’ll have
a matcha please, and a...

08:37.320 --> 08:39.600
Charlie, drop it,
you'’re not getting an iPad.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.880
Santa doesn'’t do them, the elves
don'’t have the technology.

08:44.720 --> 08:47.960
I wonder if Amanda knows about
the situation up at Toasties?

08:48.000 --> 08:51.400
The situation at Toasties?
What situation at Toasties?

08:51.440 --> 08:54.640
Another breast-feeding incident.
They asked Deirdre to cover up.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.080
I tell you,
if men were doing the feeding,

08:58.120 --> 09:01.080
there'’d be blokes all over this
café with their breasts out.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.600
Hmm, yeah.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.416
I'’m just going to see if Amanda
heard about it.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.480
Don'’t.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.040
- What?
- It'’s not gonna happen, Kevin.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.160
What'’s not?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.576
We'’re not getting on
the big table.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.840
They don'’t want us there.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.880
You'’re going to
have to accept it.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.360
I'’m just going to have a word.

09:16.400 --> 09:19.200
And she didn'’t stop,
she kept on going, and that...

09:19.240 --> 09:20.960
"Hi, Amanda, wondering

09:21.000 --> 09:23.360
if you heard about the war
on tits at Toasties?"

09:23.400 --> 09:24.760
"Sorry Kevin,

09:24.800 --> 09:26.960
my friends and I
were hoping you'’d died.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.880
"“Great, I'’ll send an email

09:28.920 --> 09:30.480
to discuss
an appropriate response."”

09:30.520 --> 09:32.400
"Whatever, my computer shits

09:32.440 --> 09:33.640
all emails
to a spam folder."”

09:33.680 --> 09:35.280
"“Okay, bye."

09:35.320 --> 09:37.000
"“Bye, go away forever."”

09:49.000 --> 09:50.216
I'’m going to
send 'round an email.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.240
Yeah.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.480
No, don'’t, no, no.

09:58.520 --> 10:01.200
Look, Duncan, today is out,
okay, just forget about today.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.720
I'’m minding my kids.

10:04.720 --> 10:06.120
A boy and a girl.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.200
Five and nine. Look, Duncan...

10:08.600 --> 10:10.360
I don'’t need to be there
to watch Elaine

10:10.400 --> 10:12.280
print out a press release.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.800
I'’ll definitely be there
on Thursday.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.120
I'’m working on it, okay.

10:24.920 --> 10:26.360
Okay, just for Georgie,

10:26.400 --> 10:28.880
because I'’ve got someone
watching Manus, but...

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
We can go swimming.

10:30.520 --> 10:31.800
- Yes.
- Okay?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.360
And Miguela'’s watching
yours and mine

10:33.400 --> 10:35.080
when we'’re
getting the mani-pedi'’s

10:35.120 --> 10:36.520
- on Friday.
- Guys, guys...

10:38.000 --> 10:39.360
Go play with
those kids over there.

10:42.440 --> 10:44.040
I think we'’re sorted this week.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.680
No, the other ones,
the other ones.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.840
- Yeah. I loved it.
- Did you enjoy it?

10:48.880 --> 10:50.040
Yeah, a bit long.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.560
- It was.
- A bit long.

10:51.600 --> 10:52.960
You lose concentration.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.120
- Oh I do, I do. Yeah.
- Don'’t you?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.800
Aah, aah...

10:58.840 --> 11:00.800
They'’re getting on really well,
aren'’t they?

11:00.840 --> 11:02.200
Sweet.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.640
It'’s Julia, isn't it?

11:05.680 --> 11:07.720
That'’s right.
And you'’re...?

11:12.040 --> 11:14.360
- Could you just say your name?
- Amanda.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.960
That'’s right.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.560
How do we know each other?

11:18.600 --> 11:20.800
- Our kids are in the same class.
- Yes!

11:20.840 --> 11:22.080
Yes, yes, that'’s right,

11:22.120 --> 11:25.240
because Ivy
is always talking about...

11:26.000 --> 11:27.280
your...

11:28.240 --> 11:30.200
- Manus.
- Manus! Yeah.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.000
Have a seat. Budge up Anne.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.040
So, where'’s your Mum
this morning?

11:39.080 --> 11:40.440
Is she still on her holiday?

11:41.280 --> 11:44.360
No, no, no,
she'’s back, alright.

11:44.400 --> 11:48.040
I just thought I'’d give her
a break, so I took the day off.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.720
You work so hard.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.400
I really admire how you can
just switch off your family

11:55.440 --> 11:56.840
and focus on your job,

11:56.880 --> 11:59.000
because this is
my personal thing,

12:00.440 --> 12:02.640
I would just
hate myself too much.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.240
Yeah, I, I hate myself too much,

12:07.280 --> 12:08.360
- but I...
- No...

12:08.400 --> 12:11.120
But I think
I'’d really hate myself.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.360
I just love my kids too much.

12:15.400 --> 12:17.960
Yeah, I love my kids
too much, too, but I...

12:18.000 --> 12:19.320
I'’d die for my kids.

12:23.040 --> 12:26.760
Okay... Yeah,
I'’d die for my kids.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.920
Only if I had to,
if I had no choice.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.880
Melissa'’s sitting there, sorry.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.080
Oh, absolutely.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.440
So, Amanda, I'’ll pop
a few ideas in an email,

12:39.480 --> 12:41.240
what to do about
the Toasties situation.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.080
- Okay, Kevin.
- Great.

12:44.120 --> 12:45.920
Let me know your thoughts...

12:46.600 --> 12:48.096
You all have my phone number,
don'’t you?

12:48.120 --> 12:50.640
Well, I did put it
in my last email,

12:50.680 --> 12:52.200
so everyone should have it.

12:52.800 --> 12:55.080
Did everyone get my last email?

12:56.000 --> 12:58.160
It had the
subject heading '‘Urgent'’.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.640
Tell Melissa we said hi.

13:02.480 --> 13:03.480
Slut!

13:04.320 --> 13:06.160
- Kevin?
- No, Liz.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.200
Oh, right.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.680
Argh, sorry everyone,

13:09.720 --> 13:11.160
I'’ve got the flat on Airbnb

13:11.200 --> 13:13.640
and the idiots have
locked themselves out.

13:13.680 --> 13:16.040
Oh! Manus, Georgie...

13:17.040 --> 13:18.080
Anne?

13:18.120 --> 13:19.840
Is there any chance
you could take

13:19.880 --> 13:22.440
Manus and Georgie back to yours
while I sort this out?

13:22.480 --> 13:23.960
Oh God, I'’m sorry,

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
Chris is home from work

13:25.040 --> 13:26.376
playing a computer game
with swearing,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.000
so we'’re
staying out of the house.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.600
I'’ll take them.

13:30.800 --> 13:31.920
I could take them?

13:32.480 --> 13:33.480
What?

13:33.880 --> 13:36.160
Oh! Are you sure?

13:36.200 --> 13:37.840
Yeah, yeah, totally sure.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.920
You go and do your thing,
it'’s no problem.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.760
I can take them, it'’s fine.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.760
That'’s what we do,
isn'’t it, us mums?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.800
Scratch each other'’s backs.
So, I could take...

13:46.840 --> 13:47.840
take them today

13:49.120 --> 13:51.240
and you could say, have mine
on Thursday, for example?

13:52.280 --> 13:53.280
Well...

13:53.680 --> 13:54.680
Thank you.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.616
I'’ll give you my address.
Anne, write it down.

13:57.640 --> 14:00.320
I'’m having some mums and kids
over later for spag bol,

14:00.600 --> 14:02.000
you and your lot are included.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.056
So, do you want to bring them
back for that later, say six?

14:05.080 --> 14:06.080
Six?

14:06.880 --> 14:08.960
Okay. Okay. Or four?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.080
No, six.

14:10.120 --> 14:11.120
Six it is.

14:14.880 --> 14:18.480
This is very kind of you, Julia.
I'’ll get you back another time.

14:18.520 --> 14:19.720
Yeah, say Thursday?

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
Thursday?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.480
Oh, Jesus!

14:25.200 --> 14:27.040
I'’ve just said,
I haven'’t got any money.

14:27.080 --> 14:29.080
Yeah, I will be there,
Andrew, I will.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.600
I just have more
child care issues today, so...

14:33.080 --> 14:34.320
A boy and a girl.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.520
Ah, Jesus,
five and nine, who cares!

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
Andrew?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.080
Manus, can I have a crisp?

14:49.120 --> 14:50.800
- I didn'’t have any breakfast.
- No!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.560
Can I just have one crisp?

14:53.600 --> 14:55.200
Stupid horse!

14:55.240 --> 14:57.800
Just sit on it, just sit on it,
and rock it.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.080
Stick two pennies together.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.840
What?

15:03.320 --> 15:05.601
If you stick two 1 p'’s together,
it thinks it'’s a pound.

15:06.640 --> 15:07.640
Thanks.

15:14.480 --> 15:15.480
Thanks.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.800
Are you alright?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.280
Yeah, I'’m just
not used to being

15:23.320 --> 15:26.240
with my kids like this, now
there'’s all these other ones.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.280
The one with the plait
has just been really mean to me.

15:30.080 --> 15:32.200
Look, I live just over there.

15:32.240 --> 15:34.080
Do you want to come
and have a cup of tea?

15:34.400 --> 15:35.400
Okay, thanks.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.600
I'’ll wait
for the horse to finish,

15:39.640 --> 15:41.040
because I want
my money'’s worth.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.080
Sure.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.200
I'’m first!

15:49.800 --> 15:50.800
I'’ve got it!

15:51.080 --> 15:53.240
Here we are. Downton Abbey.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.000
Tea?

15:59.240 --> 16:00.856
Yeah. You haven'’t got any
herbal, have you?

16:00.880 --> 16:03.600
Fennel, ginger, jasmine or mint?

16:04.120 --> 16:06.800
Ooh, I'’ll have a mint, please.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.720
I'’m joking,
I don'’t have any herbal tea.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.400
Yorkshire, I'’ve got tea
from Yorkshire, how'’s that?

16:11.440 --> 16:12.440
Yeah, okay.

16:16.920 --> 16:17.920
Oh!

16:18.520 --> 16:19.520
No milk.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.000
So, what about you?
Do you work?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.160
Yes, I organize
corporate events.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.200
Wow!

16:25.240 --> 16:26.960
On Thursday,
I'’ve got Peter Mandelson

16:27.000 --> 16:30.240
presenting the
Women in Construction awards.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.800
Was it Mandelson who was on
"“I'’m A Celebrity?"”

16:33.640 --> 16:34.640
No.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.616
I don'’t know
who you'’re thinking of, though.

16:37.640 --> 16:40.320
I wish I could re-start
my career by eating worms.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.680
Paul Burrell, that'’s who it was.

16:47.000 --> 16:50.200
Should they be doing that?
Is that not...?

16:50.240 --> 16:52.800
No, it'’s fine. It's why
I put the mattress there.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.680
- Do you work?
- I was at Citizen'’s Advice,

16:57.720 --> 17:00.160
but one of my calls got
recorded for training purposes,

17:00.200 --> 17:02.200
so... that was that.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.640
- What time is it now?
- Just past midday.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.000
Fucking hell!

17:12.320 --> 17:13.880
Are you going to this
spag bol thing?

17:13.920 --> 17:15.840
No, none of that lot like me.

17:16.240 --> 17:17.896
I'’m single,
so they'’re afraid I'm going to

17:17.920 --> 17:19.640
steal one of their
fat husbands away.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.280
I'’ll make pizza for the kids.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.120
Charlie gets a bit punchy
if he hasn'’t eaten.

17:24.600 --> 17:26.320
Let'’s get
these lunatics rounded-up.

17:29.280 --> 17:31.160
Ah, ah, excuse me,

17:31.200 --> 17:33.520
We are not animals,
use a magazine, please.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.160
Actually Liz,
I will have something.

17:37.200 --> 17:40.680
I didn'’t have any breakfast
and I forgot to eat at the café.

17:40.720 --> 17:43.280
Oh, shit, sorry,
there'’s no more pizza.

17:43.320 --> 17:44.760
Cheese sandwich?

17:44.800 --> 17:47.240
If it'’s no hassle,
I am starving.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.160
You can freeze cheese?

17:52.200 --> 17:53.320
You can freeze anything.

17:56.600 --> 17:58.240
- Want a hand with that?
- No, it'’s fine.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.760
I just need to hack into it,
to carve out some slices.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.040
Okay.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.160
- Oh, shit!
- What?

18:07.200 --> 18:10.040
Can you call a cab,
I need to go to A & E.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.880
- What, why?
- I'’ve cut my finger off.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.600
Cut your finger off?

18:14.320 --> 18:16.880
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Oh, don'’t, don't!

18:16.920 --> 18:18.280
Just keep it together.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.760
- Your finger is off!
- Focus.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.400
- Ooh!
- Just focus!

18:21.440 --> 18:24.080
An ambulance, yes?
An ambulance.

18:24.120 --> 18:26.200
- You need an ambulance.
- Just call a cab.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.240
Okay.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.240
Neil'’s Taxis.
Right. 079...

18:33.640 --> 18:35.120
Hi, I need a taxi.

18:36.040 --> 18:38.200
- What'’s your address?
- 29 Mernell Street.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.400
29 Mernell Street.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.360
They said it'’s £50
if you bleed on the seat again.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.000
- That'’s fine.
- That'’s fine.

18:47.320 --> 18:48.320
Okay.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.760
- Oh, will you be okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

18:55.800 --> 18:57.680
I'’ll get back
as quick as I can.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.400
- Great, as quick as you can.
- Yeah.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.440
Yeah. Any idea
how long these things take?

19:02.480 --> 19:03.440
Liz?

19:03.480 --> 19:05.600
Any idea
how long these things take?

19:08.880 --> 19:12.200
Hi, Liz, I was just phoning
to see how you are,

19:12.240 --> 19:15.200
and I was just wondering
what to do with your kids.

19:15.240 --> 19:17.520
I have to go to
this spag bol thing.

19:18.480 --> 19:22.520
I am so hungry
and all your food is frozen.

19:24.120 --> 19:26.920
No pressure,
but it is half five now.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.600
Okay, so if you could just
give me a call. Bye.

19:40.400 --> 19:41.400
Keith!

19:41.680 --> 19:42.680
Keith!

19:43.880 --> 19:44.960
Keith!

19:45.000 --> 19:46.000
Keith!

19:46.320 --> 19:47.320
Keith!

19:49.400 --> 19:50.400
Oh, Keith!

19:51.080 --> 19:52.480
It'’s Kevin.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.200
Keith, Keith!

19:55.640 --> 19:56.560
It'’s Kevin!

19:56.600 --> 19:57.880
Wait there! Wait there!

20:00.400 --> 20:01.560
My God, is she alright?

20:01.600 --> 20:02.680
No, she'’s fine.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.600
Just cut off
a bit of her finger.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.640
But listen, I have now got...

20:07.440 --> 20:10.400
just a massive
amount of children,

20:11.080 --> 20:13.360
could you help me
with all these children?

20:13.400 --> 20:14.560
Oh yeah, yeah. Of course.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.240
I'’m just so hungry, Kevin.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.560
Amanda'’s having a dinner,
are you sure?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.200
I haven'’t heard
anything about it.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.800
No, it'’s just an informal thing.

20:22.840 --> 20:26.440
It'’s just...
It'’s a spag bol drop-in thing.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.640
Oh, well...

20:28.640 --> 20:29.880
What are we waiting for?

20:31.840 --> 20:36.080
Hey everyone, we'’re all going
for spag bol at Amanda's!

20:47.400 --> 20:48.680
Ah, something smells good.

20:50.120 --> 20:52.640
Can somebody else
keep an ear out for the door!

20:55.400 --> 20:57.880
That'’s not the point,
the point is they'’re being picky

20:57.920 --> 20:59.200
because they know they can be.

20:59.680 --> 21:00.680
Yeah.

21:01.440 --> 21:02.576
We just have to
play the same game

21:02.600 --> 21:03.776
that they'’re playing,
aren'’t they.

21:03.800 --> 21:04.800
What are you doing?

21:06.240 --> 21:07.240
Down there!

21:07.800 --> 21:09.040
Down there!

21:11.240 --> 21:14.440
Yeah. I don'’t know. Just a
mad woman and a load of kids!

21:16.400 --> 21:17.560
Something smells good!

21:17.600 --> 21:19.920
Oh hey!

21:20.240 --> 21:24.120
- Oh, Julia, thank you so much.
- Oh, they were good as gold.

21:24.800 --> 21:25.760
Hello.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.200
Kevin'’s also here.

21:27.640 --> 21:28.640
Oh!

21:30.800 --> 21:32.520
- Yes.
- A blackboard wall!

21:33.280 --> 21:35.000
I'’ve always wanted
a blackboard wall.

21:36.320 --> 21:37.800
What do you write on it?

21:38.800 --> 21:40.800
Just... what'’s written on it.

21:44.040 --> 21:45.320
"“Walnuts."”

21:45.720 --> 21:46.840
Yes.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.280
What are you doing with walnuts?

21:48.320 --> 21:49.800
I'’d love to eat a walnut.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.560
Liz cut her finger off,

21:51.600 --> 21:53.880
so Kevin'’s been
helping me with the kids.

21:54.800 --> 21:55.960
Liz cut her finger off?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.240
Yeah, just the top half.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.000
Oh, well, help yourself to wine.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.680
And, we'’ll probably start
serving soon.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.280
Great.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.040
I'’ve always wanted a look
around your house, Amanda.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.960
There'’s nothing I like better
than going into

22:10.000 --> 22:12.440
other people'’s houses and
having a good old poke around.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.520
- Darling...
- Yeah, yeah.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.160
Those two seem to have
gotten over the Liz thing.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.840
Post by Monday.
Storm in a tea cup.

22:27.440 --> 22:28.440
The Liz thing?

22:28.520 --> 22:29.680
What, her finger?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.840
Ian gave Liz
a lift home a few nights ago.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.840
No, sorry,
you'’ve lost me. Sorry,

22:39.880 --> 22:43.640
Ian gave Liz a lift... home?

22:43.680 --> 22:44.800
You don'’t know?

22:45.640 --> 22:47.360
Liz slept with
Melissa'’s husband.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.800
Fuck!

22:49.480 --> 22:50.800
God, really?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.920
I did not know that.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.760
Are you sure?

22:55.800 --> 22:58.200
She doesn'’t seem like the type
who'’d be arsed.

23:01.000 --> 23:02.240
Where are the kids?

23:02.600 --> 23:03.800
They'’ve gone a bit quiet.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.400
Oh.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.720
Hello.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.160
Just here to pick up my kids.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.680
- Hello, hello.
- Oh!

23:19.440 --> 23:21.200
Liz, no, you should stay!

23:21.240 --> 23:23.600
It'’s turned into
a bit of a free-for-all.

23:24.440 --> 23:25.440
So...

23:26.480 --> 23:28.400
Help yourself to
a glass of wine.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.680
Oh, I shouldn'’t,
I'’m on pain-killers, so...

23:30.720 --> 23:33.400
Oh, your finger.
Julia said. How is it?

23:33.440 --> 23:35.400
It'’s not too bad. Still works.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.600
They'’re not feeding
the adults, Liz!

23:59.640 --> 24:01.520
They'’re not feeding the adults!

24:06.600 --> 24:08.400
None of these dicks like me!

24:09.200 --> 24:10.480
Dicks!

24:11.480 --> 24:12.960
I'’m sure that's not true.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.120
They hate me.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.200
Dicks!

24:16.520 --> 24:18.200
You know
why that is, don'’t you?

24:18.240 --> 24:19.680
- What?
- You know.

24:19.720 --> 24:21.040
No I don'’t know, Kevin, what?

24:23.640 --> 24:25.840
Because you slept with
Melissa'’s husband.

24:30.280 --> 24:31.640
Is that what they'’re saying?

24:32.080 --> 24:33.080
Yeah.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.240
That'’s interesting.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
Yes, so we went to
the hospital on Wednesday,

24:41.040 --> 24:42.680
and they had
the results of the scan,

24:42.720 --> 24:43.720
and...

24:44.920 --> 24:46.760
basically, they think
it was a small stroke.

24:46.800 --> 24:47.600
Oh no.

24:47.640 --> 24:48.640
Oh no.

24:53.120 --> 24:55.376
Sorry, I heard "“small stroke" ”,
I don'’t know who that was,

24:55.400 --> 24:56.760
but that is terrible.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.120
Whoever that was.

24:58.480 --> 24:59.640
My husband.

24:59.680 --> 25:03.480
Oh, yeah. Must have been
a real pain in the arse.

25:04.440 --> 25:05.600
How did that happen?

25:07.600 --> 25:09.480
He was playing a computer game,

25:09.520 --> 25:13.320
and I noticed his arm just
drop down the side of the sofa.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.840
And when I went to
take his hand, it just...

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
it felt like...

25:20.080 --> 25:21.240
a little dead bird.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.200
Hmm!

25:37.560 --> 25:39.560
There'’s some more,
I'’ll just put that in the bin.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.000
Julia?

25:46.640 --> 25:47.680
What are you doing?

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
Oh, I was just

25:53.120 --> 25:54.560
I was just
picking at the left-overs.

25:54.600 --> 25:57.240
If you were hungry,
you could have just asked.

25:57.280 --> 25:59.560
You'’re making me feel like
a bad hostess.

25:59.600 --> 26:00.640
Oh, I'’m sorry.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.056
Do you want me to
cook you something?

26:02.080 --> 26:03.960
I can'’t bear you
eating out of the bin

26:04.000 --> 26:05.440
like a homeless person.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.080
Oh no, I wasn'’t eating
out of the bin, it'’s just I...

26:08.440 --> 26:09.520
I was just...

26:11.080 --> 26:12.656
You know, I just thought there'’d
be food here for the adults.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.600
- Oh God!
- Wow!

26:15.680 --> 26:18.400
Well, Julia, I'’ve been
dealing with something,

26:18.640 --> 26:21.560
and I'’m sorry I didn't have time
to lay on a banquet.

26:21.600 --> 26:22.840
No, I didn'’t mean...

26:22.880 --> 26:24.080
Want me to cook you an omelet?

26:24.120 --> 26:27.000
- No, honestly, I'’m fine...
- No, I insist!

26:27.040 --> 26:29.280
I can'’t have my guests
eating out of the rubbish!

26:30.000 --> 26:31.480
Does anyone else want food?

26:32.440 --> 26:34.680
Anyone?
I'’m making Julia an omelet.

26:35.880 --> 26:36.880
Anyone?

26:38.000 --> 26:39.720
I'’ll have an omelet,
actually, Amanda.

26:40.880 --> 26:43.600
Saves me defrosting some eggs
when I get home.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.800
And while I get the chance,
Melissa,

26:45.840 --> 26:47.400
I should say I feel bad.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.800
I feel bad.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.760
I should have cleared
the air and apologize,

26:50.800 --> 26:54.840
for taking your fat husband'’s
virginity twenty years ago!

26:56.720 --> 26:59.960
And while I'’m at it,
Anne, can you RSVP to

27:00.000 --> 27:03.040
Charlie'’s birthday party because
he really wants Darius there,

27:03.080 --> 27:04.480
and it'’ll break
his fucking heart

27:04.520 --> 27:06.200
if his best friend
doesn'’t make it!

27:06.800 --> 27:08.000
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

27:14.240 --> 27:15.240
What's going on?

27:15.680 --> 27:17.000
Amanda'’s making us an omelet.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.480
Ooh, yes, please!

27:22.400 --> 27:25.200
Wow, you must give me the recipe
for that omelet.

27:26.680 --> 27:27.680
Eggs.

27:28.720 --> 27:30.240
Yeah, keep it simple.

27:31.320 --> 27:32.320
So...

27:33.000 --> 27:34.000
shall we...

27:35.280 --> 27:36.856
- firm up Thursday now?
- Thursday is not going to work

27:36.880 --> 27:38.080
for me now.

27:38.120 --> 27:39.640
- Lovely to see you all.
- Oh, I'’ve...

27:43.400 --> 27:45.520
Did she just
slam the door in my face?

27:47.680 --> 27:49.200
That'’s a whole network
of helpful mums

27:49.240 --> 27:51.560
I have no access to anymore.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.560
Oh well, you can'’t
make an omelet without

27:54.600 --> 27:56.840
telling a few skinny bitches
to go fuck themselves.

27:56.880 --> 27:59.440
I can have a word with them,
if you like, that might help?

28:01.240 --> 28:04.000
Oh, screw them.
We don'’t need them.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.040
We'’ve got our own
little gang right here.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.320
Oh, alright,

28:08.640 --> 28:10.360
- I'’ll take them Thursday.
- Oh, thanks!

28:11.200 --> 28:15.000
Oh, thank you!
I really appreciate it. Oh!

28:18.400 --> 28:20.080
And Friday, can you do Friday?
