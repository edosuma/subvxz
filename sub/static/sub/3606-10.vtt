00:00.101 --> 00:05.104
Kara: <i> When I was a child,</i>
<i> my planet Krypton was dying.</i>

00:05.106 --> 00:08.374
<i> I was sent to earth</i>
<i> to protect my cousin.</i>

00:08.376 --> 00:10.342
<i> But my pod got</i>
<i> knocked off-course</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:12.077
<i> and by the time I got here,</i>

00:12.079 --> 00:16.081
<i> my cousin</i>
<i> had already grown up</i>
<i> and become superman.</i>

00:16.083 --> 00:17.950
<i> And so I hid my powers</i>

00:17.952 --> 00:22.654
<i> until recently</i>
<i> when an accident forced me</i>
<i> to reveal myself to the world.</i>

00:22.656 --> 00:26.158
<i> To most people</i>
<i> I'm an assistant</i>
<i> at catco worldwide media.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:29.595
<i> But in secret, I work with my</i>
<i> adoptive sister for the deo</i>

00:29.597 --> 00:31.597
<i> to protect my city</i>
<i> from alien life</i>

00:31.599 --> 00:34.400
<i> and anyone else</i>
<i> that means to cause it harm.</i>

00:35.636 --> 00:38.237
<i> I am Supergirl.</i>

00:38.239 --> 00:39.838
Kara:
<i> Previously on</i> Supergirl...

00:39.840 --> 00:41.573
Winn: <i> What did you really</i>
<i> find out about Max?</i>

00:41.575 --> 00:43.709
He's planning a countermove
against the Kryptonians.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.611
(Groaning)

00:45.613 --> 00:47.880
Do not mistake
my compassion
for weakness.

00:47.882 --> 00:49.515
This is not a truce.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.350
And if you want to prove to me
that you're not the bad guy,

00:51.352 --> 00:53.252
then help me
find the real one.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.620
Winn, I didn't quite get it.

00:54.622 --> 00:55.487
Get what?

00:55.489 --> 00:56.688
James: <i> How much you like Kara.</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.190
Hank:
<i> I am a shape shifter.</i>

00:58.192 --> 01:01.060
My name
is j'onn j'onzz.

01:04.265 --> 01:06.098
(Gate opening)

01:09.937 --> 01:11.804
(Clicks tongue)

01:11.806 --> 01:14.873
Last time I brought him
breakfast, I had nightmares
for a month.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.141
It's your turn, pal.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.144
(Prison gate opening)

01:28.689 --> 01:31.390
Doll:
<i> Do you wanna play with me?</i>

01:31.392 --> 01:32.958
Breakfast.
You got ten minutes.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.793
<i> I miss you.</i>

01:34.795 --> 01:36.462
You know the rules.
If you don't start eating,
i take it away.

01:36.464 --> 01:38.330
<i> -I love you. Do you love me?</i>
-(Knocking)

01:38.332 --> 01:39.698
Hey. Do you
hear me in there?

01:43.104 --> 01:44.636
-(Softly) Damn it.
-(Beeps)

01:53.013 --> 01:54.813
What the hell took
you so long?

02:00.054 --> 02:01.420
(Groans)

02:03.824 --> 02:05.157
What the...

02:05.793 --> 02:07.226
(Groans)

02:18.405 --> 02:19.471
(Laughs)

02:21.075 --> 02:22.474
How much fun is this?

02:22.476 --> 02:24.309
This isn't about fun.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.345
This is my one chance
to train you in proper
flight technique.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.063
You could feel like
that all the time, you know.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.366
Free. Untethered.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.168
True to who you really are.

02:49.170 --> 02:52.504
The world needs Hank henshaw
more than it needs
j'onn j'onzz.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.373
Okay, I've pinpointed
the location of room 52

02:54.375 --> 02:58.410
at lord technologies,
assuming we can trust
James Olsen's intel.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.646
Superman trusts him.
That's good
enough for me.

03:00.648 --> 03:03.782
Supergirl trusts him
and that's more than
good enough.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.884
Supergirl:
If you're infiltrating
lord tech, I'm in.

03:05.886 --> 03:09.388
Max beat James to a pulp
for finding room 52.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.523
-What could he be hiding
in there?
-We will find out.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.992
But it will require subterfuge
and subtlety,

03:13.994 --> 03:15.494
not a red cape.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.763
Couldn't it also require
a bit of martian manpower?

03:17.765 --> 03:18.864
That's not an option.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.301
You know,

03:22.303 --> 03:25.904
when I came out,
embraced my powers,

03:25.906 --> 03:29.708
finally letting myself be
who I'm meant to be,

03:29.710 --> 03:31.777
it turned out to be the best
thing I ever did.

03:33.013 --> 03:34.413
That's you.

03:37.151 --> 03:38.417
(Sighs)

03:39.286 --> 03:40.886
Cat: Lois.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.387
How is she doing?

03:42.389 --> 03:44.856
You know, your sister and i
have been dear friends

03:44.858 --> 03:47.359
for longer than she cares
to admit.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.562
To be honest, cat,
Lois and I don't talk much.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.731
We've never been
particularly close.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.299
Really?

03:54.301 --> 03:56.835
That's not how she
portrays the Lane sisters
in her memoir,

03:56.837 --> 03:58.337
<i> a time to soar.</i>

03:58.339 --> 04:01.306
I never read it.
Seemed like
self-promotional claptrap.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.008
I see. (Chuckles)

04:03.844 --> 04:05.510
You're the smart one

04:05.512 --> 04:07.579
-and the pretty one.
-(Laughs)

04:08.048 --> 04:09.248
West point?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.183
And a jd-mba at Harvard.

04:11.185 --> 04:12.784
Cat: Why the army?

04:12.786 --> 04:15.454
Why not cash out
on wall street
or a big law firm?

04:15.456 --> 04:18.557
And spend my life engaging in
fraud and harassment?

04:18.559 --> 04:20.859
No.
I wanted to be effective.

04:20.861 --> 04:24.263
-I wanted to serve.
-Exactly the qualities
I'm looking for.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.100
Where do you see yourself
in five years?

04:28.102 --> 04:31.536
-Uh... is this a job
interview?
-Do you want it to be?

04:31.538 --> 04:34.273
(Laughs)
I'm flattered, cat,

04:34.275 --> 04:38.043
but I just moved here.
I'm not looking for
a position at the moment.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.845
(Sighing) Oh, Lucy!

04:39.847 --> 04:42.848
A few weeks ago
you were briefing
the joint chiefs of staff.

04:42.850 --> 04:45.317
And now you're available
to meet me
on a day's notice

04:45.319 --> 04:47.486
wearing a glorified
pair of yoga pants.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.789
-Oh, they're balenciaga...
-They're yoga pants.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.859
Now, look, I'm not immune
to the allure of James Olsen

04:53.861 --> 04:56.561
wearing a shirt that
is unbuttoned one too many.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.664
But a woman with brains
who gives up
everything for love

04:58.666 --> 05:02.134
inevitably finds herself
staring into an
existential abyss

05:02.136 --> 05:06.004
that men, babies
and cardio bars
simply cannot fill.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.041
You are a smart and
accomplished woman
who needs to work,

05:09.043 --> 05:11.910
or you will lose
your confidence,
your sense of identity,

05:11.912 --> 05:14.680
and most importantly,
your mind.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.650
Do you have a job for me?

05:18.652 --> 05:20.952
Kara: That was
a genuine laugh.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.188
That was not fake,
that was real.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.090
What do you think
they're talking about
in there?

05:25.092 --> 05:27.693
Kara does have
this handy ability
called superhearing...

05:27.695 --> 05:31.496
Yeah, but that just
feels wrong,
doesn't it?

05:31.498 --> 05:34.866
-Is that wrong?
-(Whispers) Do it.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.637
Newscaster: <i> The eccentric</i>
<i> criminal known as "toyman"</i>
<i> to his fellow inmates</i>

05:38.639 --> 05:43.275
<i> escaped from the</i>
<i> Van kull maximum</i>
<i> security prison this morning.</i>

05:43.277 --> 05:46.411
<i> -Toyman got his name</i>
<i> from the dangerous and...</i>
-(Mutes TV)

05:49.149 --> 05:51.583
What's going on with him?

05:51.585 --> 05:52.951
-I don't know.
-Cat: We'll be in touch.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.786
Lucy: Yes.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.725
She's so nice.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.993
Nobody has ever said
that before.

06:01.995 --> 06:04.529
(Clears throat)
Um... so, did she, uh...

06:04.531 --> 06:06.264
-Did she want something
from you or...
-Yes.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.301
She wants me to be her general
counsel, starting immediately.

06:09.303 --> 06:10.936
What?

06:10.938 --> 06:12.104
(Lucy chuckles)

06:12.106 --> 06:13.839
Congratulations.
That's... that's amazing.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.341
So you would be here?

06:16.343 --> 06:19.611
Uh, yeah, I have to think
about it a little bit, but...

06:19.613 --> 06:22.848
The, uh, old gc's
office is on this floor.

06:24.918 --> 06:27.119
-Wow, so you'd...
Then you'd be right here.
-Yeah.

06:27.121 --> 06:28.620
That's great...

06:28.622 --> 06:30.989
Special agent
Cameron chase,
with the FBI.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.657
I'm here for
winslow schott, Jr.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.561
That's me.

06:38.866 --> 06:41.566
I'm sure you're aware
that your father escaped
prison this morning.

06:41.568 --> 06:42.934
-Has he called you?
-No.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.870
-Has he come to your house?
-(Sighing) No.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.705
Has he attempted to contact
you in any way?

06:46.707 --> 06:49.007
No, no, he wouldn't
even know where to look, okay.

06:49.009 --> 06:53.645
Mr. schott, your father
is unhinged and extremely
dangerous.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.680
So nothing's changed,
that's good to know.

06:55.682 --> 06:57.816
Did he have any friends
he might want to contact?

06:57.818 --> 07:00.986
If it weren't already apparent
by the trail of bodies
that he leaves in his wake,

07:00.988 --> 07:02.087
he hates people.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.022
So no, he didn't have
any friends.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.490
As his son,
you must have some...

07:05.492 --> 07:06.725
The day my father
set off a toy bomb

07:06.727 --> 07:08.059
and killed
half a dozen people

07:08.061 --> 07:10.495
was the day I stopped
being his son.

07:20.174 --> 07:21.506
(Sighs)

07:22.810 --> 07:26.344
Guessing you were listening
to that whole thing?

07:26.346 --> 07:29.915
(Sighs) You told me
your dad was in prison
but not that he...

07:29.917 --> 07:31.783
Because I didn't want you
looking at me

07:31.785 --> 07:34.052
the way that you're
looking at me right now.

07:37.491 --> 07:39.191
And you wanna know
the worst part?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.561
He wasn't always crazy.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.765
In fact, he was a good dad,
he was normal.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.801
We'd go to his workshop
and tinker, build a toy.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.536
So you never saw any signs?

07:51.538 --> 07:53.939
No. He was...
He was quiet.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.508
Scared to death
of losing his job.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.013
He was angry.

08:03.851 --> 08:07.752
I guess no one knew
how angry until
it was too late.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.795
His boss stole his toy designs

08:17.464 --> 08:18.730
and got rich off them.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.465
(Sighs) Did your dad
fight back?

08:20.467 --> 08:23.068
No. He was a coward.

08:23.070 --> 08:26.438
He didn't say anything,
he didn't stand up
for himself.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.673
What he did was put
a bomb in a Teddy bear.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.775
And then he sent one
to his boss.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.079
Chester dunholtz.

08:37.618 --> 08:40.051
Except his assistant
opened the package.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.889
It killed her and five
other people.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.326
(Sniffles)

08:48.328 --> 08:51.263
I know there's nothing
anyone can say to make
you feel better right now.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.732
Well, hey,
you have a homicidal
maniac in the family too,

08:53.734 --> 08:56.468
so you know where
I'm coming from.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.271
At least your father knows
enough to keep his distance.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.145
(Softly) Except I found this
on my desk this morning.

09:08.916 --> 09:11.650
Toy: <i> Son, come see me</i>
<i> at our favorite place.</i>

09:11.652 --> 09:13.652
<i> I'll be waiting for you.</i>

09:13.654 --> 09:16.254
Oh, winn.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.423
-I don't know what to do.
-Why did you lie to the feds?

09:18.425 --> 09:20.325
I don't know.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.061
Okay, I've spent my entire
life just trying to
forget what he did.

09:23.063 --> 09:26.364
Trying not to be consumed
by this anger
that I have for him.

09:26.366 --> 09:28.767
And trying, even in my best
moments, to forgive.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.703
But I still just hate him.

09:34.308 --> 09:37.609
I'm leaving an agent here,
in case your father shows up.

09:39.479 --> 09:42.147
(Sighs) Agent chase...

09:42.149 --> 09:44.983
There's, uh, something
i have to tell you.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.757
Hank: <i> If we're</i>
<i> going to infiltrate</i>
<i> lord technologies,</i>

09:52.759 --> 09:55.694
we cut the power in the rear
of the lab and infiltrate
the basement.

09:55.696 --> 09:59.998
While the emergency generators
kick in and his army
pounces on us.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.800
This isn't the way in, Hank.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.703
You have a better idea.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.138
You are the greatest asset
that we have

10:07.140 --> 10:09.107
and nobody knows about it.

10:09.109 --> 10:11.109
All these computers and
these weapons, they're nothing
compared to you.

10:11.111 --> 10:14.245
I can't keep using my powers.
It's too much of a risk.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.849
It is our job to take risks.

10:17.851 --> 10:19.684
We run into the line of fire.

10:19.686 --> 10:22.053
We face enemies that
no one on this planet
has the courage to.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.522
And the best way for me
to fight them is as head
of the deo.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.791
I can't be head of the deo
if I'm an alien.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.361
You saw what Max lord
did to James.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.596
You know he's after my sister.

10:31.598 --> 10:34.532
I have been j'onn j'onzz
on earth.

10:34.534 --> 10:36.101
I have tried it.

10:36.103 --> 10:38.169
I was hunted for 50 years.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.673
People I've loved have tried
to kill me once they
discovered who I really was.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.208
I'm sorry.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.877
But times have changed.

10:45.879 --> 10:47.779
Look at Supergirl,
the world loves her...

10:47.781 --> 10:50.482
Your sister looks like
a pretty blonde cheerleader.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.785
J'onn j'onzz looks like
a monster.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.087
I will never be
tolerated here on earth.

10:56.089 --> 11:00.158
The more time I spend
as Hank henshaw, the less
i have to face what I've lost.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.263
But when I change my state,

11:06.166 --> 11:08.333
shapeshift into someone new,

11:08.335 --> 11:11.703
call upon new powers,

11:11.705 --> 11:14.873
I get one step closer
to becoming the
martian manhunter forever.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.243
And he creates panic
and hysteria. I know,
i have seen it.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.179
It's not only that
I'm better off as human.

11:22.249 --> 11:24.516
-Everyone is.
-Except Kara.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.585
She needs your help.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.231
Uh... approaching
the target now.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.600
Oh, god,
it still smells
like fish.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.203
You don't need to speak
into the wire for it to work.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.672
Oh, uh, yeah. Copy that.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.475
Echo team, move into position.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.410
Agent: <i> Copy.</i>
<i> Moving in.</i>

11:54.214 --> 11:56.147
You can't let anything
happen to winn.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.684
(Sighs) His father killed
an agent the last time
we apprehended him.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.653
We're not leaving
anything to chance.

12:01.655 --> 12:03.555
-Agent chase...
-Miss danvers,
the only reason you're here

12:03.557 --> 12:05.557
is because your friend
wouldn't do this without you.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.426
-So be quiet,
stay out of the way.
-(Cocking gun)

12:13.867 --> 12:17.602
Did you know that 90%
of catco companies
are run by women?

12:18.905 --> 12:20.805
Yeah, it's cool.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.440
(Clears throat)
Um...

12:24.344 --> 12:26.044
So, are you gonna
take the job?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.378
Well, what do you think?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.781
You think it'd be
fun to work together?

12:29.783 --> 12:33.318
I think you should
take it if you want it.
For sure.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.053
That's not what I asked.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.554
(Laughs)

12:38.291 --> 12:40.358
Well, it's, you know,
it's your career, Lucy.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.527
I can't really make
that decision for you.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.066
This is a really great
opportunity for me, James.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.801
I earned it.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.037
I want to work for a cool,
powerful, kickass woman

12:53.039 --> 12:55.440
instead of a bunch of
angry old white men.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.342
Well, it sounds like you know
what you want.

12:59.346 --> 13:01.813
-What do you want?
-I want you to be happy.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.151
If it were you,
if you moved
your life for me

13:06.153 --> 13:09.287
and got an offer like this,
i would be thrilled.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.689
I think you should
take the job.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.025
I am not asking
your permission.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.661
(Sighs)

13:19.599 --> 13:21.766
(Cell phone ringing)

13:23.904 --> 13:27.205
What are you today,
CIA? IRS?

13:27.207 --> 13:28.306
You want to see my 1040s?

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
Shut up and listen.

13:29.643 --> 13:31.776
We need to talk.
In private.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.145
Off the record.
Lay everything
on the table.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.748
Sounds remarkably like a date.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.817
But what does
your boss think?

13:38.819 --> 13:41.820
My boss isn't always willing
to take the necessary steps
to get things done.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.688
Maxwell: <i> You're going rogue?</i>
(Chuckles)

13:44.024 --> 13:45.523
How fun.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.791
How do I know
i can trust you?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.259
You don't.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.861
See you tonight.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.032
I'll have him
out of lord tech
until 10:00.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.335
But his employees
and security are still
going to be there.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.003
I have it covered.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.939
You or j'onn j'onzz?

14:06.813 --> 14:08.947
(Carnival music
playing faintly)

14:15.589 --> 14:18.857
Doll: <i> I love you.</i>
<i> Do you love me?</i>

14:22.562 --> 14:26.030
<i> I love you.</i>
<i> Do you love me?</i>

14:34.007 --> 14:35.139
Dad?

14:42.315 --> 14:43.882
God, look at you.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.851
(Sighs)

14:46.853 --> 14:48.386
You need to turn yourself in.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.954
(Laughs)

14:49.956 --> 14:54.192
I broke out of prison
for you, for us.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.628
I'm sorry I was gone
so long.

14:56.630 --> 14:59.130
You need a doctor, okay?
You need some help.

14:59.132 --> 15:02.467
My son.
My good boy.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.938
My greatest work.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.039
(Gasps)

15:09.576 --> 15:11.676
I thought this was your
greatest work.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.484
We're the same, you and I.
We're linked.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.757
Together we can do anything.

15:25.759 --> 15:30.028
-We are... we are
not the same.
-That genius

15:30.030 --> 15:33.231
that lesser people
call madness.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.466
That's inside of you too.

15:35.468 --> 15:39.504
-We got eyes on schott.
Tactical teams, mobilize.
-All right, let's go.

15:42.008 --> 15:44.375
We can't do our job
and worry about you too.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.010
We're Oscar Mike.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.883
Schott: Why didn't
you visit me?

15:51.885 --> 15:54.519
I just wanted to know
that you were okay.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.521
(Softly) I was not okay.

15:58.191 --> 16:04.662
I watched my dad get
dragged off to prison
when I was 11 for murder.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.667
How okay could I be
after that, dad?

16:14.708 --> 16:16.074
Whoa!
It's okay, it's okay.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.909
Hands where I can
see them, now!

16:17.911 --> 16:19.978
-Easy.
-I said hands up!

16:19.980 --> 16:21.746
Damn it, dad,
put your hands up!

16:21.748 --> 16:24.082
Winn, how could you?

16:25.085 --> 16:26.684
Agent chase: Suspect
not cooperating.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.286
-Weapons free...
-No! No!

16:28.288 --> 16:29.754
(Gunfire)

16:36.262 --> 16:37.395
What the...

16:37.397 --> 16:39.530
It's not him.
He's not here.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.100
Doll: <i> I told you</i>
<i> to come alone.</i>

16:42.102 --> 16:43.501
<i> Now run.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:45.136
-What?
-(Angrily) <i> Run.</i>

16:46.272 --> 16:47.872
(Gas hissing)

16:51.044 --> 16:52.877
(Coughing)

17:05.625 --> 17:06.924
(Coughing)

17:19.472 --> 17:22.273
Agent chase:
He specifically asked you
to come to this arcade?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.442
Does your father have
some sort of plan for you?

17:24.444 --> 17:26.244
Winn: I don't know.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.147
He said, "i broke out of
prison for you, for us."
What does that mean?

17:29.149 --> 17:31.049
I have no idea.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.885
He called you his "greatest
work." And he said, "together
we can do anything."

17:33.887 --> 17:35.620
(Scoffs) He's crazy. I mean,

17:35.622 --> 17:37.855
I don't even know
why you're writing
all this stuff down.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.190
It doesn't make any sense.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.059
Agent: Agent chase,
take a look at this.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.397
Ahem. (Coughs)

17:46.399 --> 17:48.699
-Winn: You sure
you're all right?
-Yeah.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.903
I don't normally inhale...

17:51.905 --> 17:54.038
They're going to kill him.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.541
They're going to go find him,
and then go kill him.

17:56.543 --> 17:57.775
Not if we find him first.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.877
Kara, no, no.
Okay?

17:59.879 --> 18:02.480
I'm not going to make you
commit a federal offense by
going around these guys.

18:02.482 --> 18:05.616
No. This is...
This is my burden...

18:05.618 --> 18:07.085
-Which means it's mine too.
-(Groans)

18:07.087 --> 18:10.721
Winn, think about everything
you've done for me.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.790
The last few months,
becoming Supergirl,

18:12.792 --> 18:15.126
I wouldn't have been able
to survive without you.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.662
You'd be fine.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.198
I mean, yeah,
the Supergirl suit sucked.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.966
But you, Kara,

18:21.968 --> 18:24.535
with everything that you have?
(Scoffs)

18:24.537 --> 18:27.138
Everything that you...
That you are?

18:27.941 --> 18:30.942
No, you don't really need me.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.276
-You're wrong.
-No.

18:32.278 --> 18:33.811
I do.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.014
I know what it's like
to feel isolated and alone.

18:37.016 --> 18:40.351
I relive that feeling in
my darkest moments.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.986
But when I'm with you,

18:42.689 --> 18:44.322
I never feel that way.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.757
When your dad says
he misses you, I believe him.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.794
Because if you weren't
in my life...

18:49.796 --> 18:53.564
(Sighing) I'd be lost too.

18:53.566 --> 18:57.368
I have a creepy little
doll that I could give you
for when you're lonely.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.703
(Laughs)

19:00.106 --> 19:02.240
Please just let me
be there for you.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.308
The way you've always
been there for me.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.377
(Cell phone ringing)

19:06.379 --> 19:09.247
Except just not in
the next 20 minutes.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.182
Cat just texted me.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.383
Winn: Go ahead.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.965
(Alex sighs)

19:31.204 --> 19:33.804
You're staring.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.908
Just wondering where
you're hiding your gun
under that dress.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.809
Behave and you won't
have to find out.

19:46.519 --> 19:48.419
Cat: Why didn't you tell me?

19:48.421 --> 19:50.855
-Tell you what?
-That winn schott, our beloved
little computer elf,

19:50.857 --> 19:52.890
is the spawn of toyman.

19:52.892 --> 19:54.992
I don't think he really wanted
anyone to know.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.296
Well, perhaps he should
consider changing his name.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.898
So, when can we set up
the TV interview?

20:00.900 --> 20:02.633
He seems like
a very sensitive boy.

20:02.635 --> 20:04.168
Do you think
he can cry on cue?

20:04.170 --> 20:06.404
Ms. Grant,
winn is not doing
any interviews.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.906
Fine.

20:08.908 --> 20:12.176
But if I see him talking
to Diane Sawyer, he's fired.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.178
Now I need you to go
down to hr

20:14.180 --> 20:16.347
and get me the offer packet
for Lucy Lane.

20:16.349 --> 20:19.150
I want to make sure that
everything is organized
for her to sign tomorrow.

20:19.152 --> 20:21.385
-Has she said yes yet?
-No.

20:21.387 --> 20:23.087
But she will.

20:23.089 --> 20:26.490
You don't think
you should have
talked to James before

20:26.492 --> 20:28.459
offering his girlfriend a job?

20:28.461 --> 20:32.763
(Sighs) Oh, Kara.
James' problem is not
having his girlfriend at work.

20:32.765 --> 20:36.634
His problem is having
his girlfriend at work
while he's having

20:36.636 --> 20:38.803
whatever he's having with...

20:38.805 --> 20:40.204
Someone else.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.207
I don't know what you are
talking about.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.309
There is nothing going on
between James and I.

20:45.311 --> 20:48.412
As much as I love watching
you millennials
deny your feelings,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.381
I pay you not to have them.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.650
Now, I need a lawyer,
and this is a place of work,

20:52.652 --> 20:55.720
not the bullpen of tmz.
Go get me the offer packet.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.088
Yes, Ms. Grant.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.226
(Sighs) Honestly, she should
be paying me by the hour.

21:05.531 --> 21:07.531
-Try this.
-Mmm.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.833
I can feed myself.

21:14.207 --> 21:15.873
It's amazing.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.809
It's de jaeger.
Snail eggs.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.444
That's $100 a mouthful,
don't spit it out.

21:20.446 --> 21:22.146
No, I'm sorry.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.281
Ugh!

21:25.451 --> 21:27.118
Look, the, uh...

21:28.121 --> 21:30.588
The aliens that invaded
your lab

21:30.590 --> 21:31.989
are very dangerous.

21:31.991 --> 21:34.025
We need to know
what they were looking for.

21:34.027 --> 21:36.560
Funny you should mention
danger and aliens but not
a word about Supergirl.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.763
She saves lives.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.065
You save lives.
And you worked to get
your powers.

21:41.067 --> 21:45.469
You didn't just wake up
with them one day
'cause the sun was shining.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.406
-Doesn't that bother you?
-Why are you so
obsessed with her?

21:49.676 --> 21:51.742
Is it jealousy?

21:51.744 --> 21:54.812
-Are you secretly in love?
-(Laughs)

21:54.814 --> 21:59.150
-Or are you threatened
because she's a woman?
-Ah.

21:59.152 --> 22:01.519
Only a woman would say that.
(Laughs)

22:03.856 --> 22:05.423
Tell me your connection
to Supergirl.

22:09.128 --> 22:13.230
The organization that
i work for has a, uh...

22:13.232 --> 22:15.433
Professional partnership
with her.

22:17.203 --> 22:18.436
(Chuckles)

22:22.742 --> 22:25.343
The aliens didn't
take anything.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.946
I have everything
in my lab itemized.
Nothing was missing.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.748
(Sighs) Then why were
they there?

22:30.750 --> 22:33.517
I was hoping you could
tell me.

22:33.519 --> 22:36.053
You seem to know a lot more
about them than I do.

22:38.391 --> 22:39.924
To Alex danvers.

22:40.626 --> 22:42.493
Hero in her own right.

22:52.705 --> 22:56.874
Mr. lord? Aren't you
supposed to be out
with agent danvers?

22:56.876 --> 22:59.043
I ended the evening early.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.145
To be honest,
it was a little
disappointing.

23:01.147 --> 23:05.216
As long as we're being honest,
she did strike me as a little
humorless for you.

23:05.218 --> 23:07.017
She's actually a lovely woman.

23:07.019 --> 23:09.353
If anything, it was
my narcissism
and ill-kempt facial hair

23:09.355 --> 23:11.088
that ruined any chances
i had with her.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.190
I'm sure you weren't
at fault, sir.

23:13.192 --> 23:17.862
Getting so soundly rejected
has caused me to question
many of my life choices.

23:17.864 --> 23:19.363
I need to be alone,
if you don't mind.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.916
Robotic voice:
<i> Access denied.</i>

23:41.821 --> 23:43.187
<i> Access denied.</i>

23:43.189 --> 23:45.423
You can take the martian
out of Mars.

23:57.470 --> 23:58.536
(Camera clicks)

24:02.008 --> 24:03.641
(Camera clicking)

24:14.987 --> 24:16.454
What is he doing to you?

24:18.224 --> 24:19.590
Freeze!

24:19.592 --> 24:21.325
Mr. lord. I'm sorry.

24:21.327 --> 24:23.627
-Silent alarm went off.
-Don't worry about it.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.162
I was just
checking on her.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.298
I'll leave you alone.

24:27.300 --> 24:30.267
Actually, I'm a bit concerned
about her condition.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.503
We need to get her
to a doctor off-site.

24:32.505 --> 24:35.906
Uh, do me a favor,
get an ambulance here.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.741
But she's code Phoenix, sir.

24:37.743 --> 24:39.743
I'm aware of that.

24:39.745 --> 24:43.047
Sir, would you mind telling
me what code Phoenix is?

24:44.383 --> 24:46.183
No problem.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.485
-(Grunts)
-(Groans)

24:47.487 --> 24:49.186
(Grunting)

24:52.158 --> 24:54.925
Something tells me you
won't keep quiet about this.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.361
Please.
Don't kill me.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.066
Who are you?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.338
No one you'll remember.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.526
I'll be back for you.

25:28.528 --> 25:29.727
I promise.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.233
Winn: Okay, you see
this etching?

25:36.235 --> 25:37.835
Kara: Is that a "y"?
What does that mean?

25:37.837 --> 25:39.537
It's a slingshot.

25:39.539 --> 25:42.640
Slingschott toys was the
company my dad created.

25:42.642 --> 25:44.975
It went bankrupt, but the
old factory's still standing.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.478
-Do you think that's where
he is?
-I know it.

26:02.662 --> 26:04.128
Mr. schott?

26:06.799 --> 26:08.465
(Machine puttering)

26:09.835 --> 26:11.268
(Machine grinding)

26:11.270 --> 26:13.637
I'm a friend of your son's.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.775
(Clinking)

26:33.326 --> 26:35.759
I know how much
you love your son.

26:37.396 --> 26:38.829
Think about what's best
for him.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.098
That's all I think about.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.306
(Grunting)

26:51.677 --> 26:55.512
Mr. schott,
you have the chance
to make it up to your son.

26:55.514 --> 26:58.549
I am making it up to him.
That's why I'm here.

26:58.551 --> 27:00.851
Child: Help.
Is anyone out there?

27:00.853 --> 27:04.521
Schott: It's so easy
to lure a child
if you offer them a toy.

27:04.523 --> 27:05.756
(Grunts)

27:05.758 --> 27:07.625
Oh, you're drowning
in quicksand, by the way.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.960
The more you struggle,
the deeper you sink.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.328
Child: I'm scared.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.163
I understand even you
need oxygen.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.366
Soon, you won't
be able to breathe.

27:15.368 --> 27:16.734
Child: It's dark in here...

27:16.736 --> 27:20.404
-...and I can't get out.
-Oh, I wouldn't do that.

27:20.406 --> 27:23.007
Slingschott quicksand
is laced with thermite.
Add heat...

27:23.009 --> 27:24.475
Child: (Screaming)
Help me!

27:24.477 --> 27:26.510
...this whole place
will blow. (Chuckles)

27:27.346 --> 27:28.646
(Supergirl straining)

27:28.648 --> 27:29.980
Child: Help me, please!
Help me!

27:29.982 --> 27:31.281
Game over.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.484
Child: I'm trapped in here.

27:33.486 --> 27:35.152
Supergirl: I'm going
to save you.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.488
Child: Help me,
please help me!
I'm trapped in here.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.191
Child: Help me,
help me!

27:43.062 --> 27:44.862
Help!

27:48.034 --> 27:49.299
Child: Help!

27:55.975 --> 27:57.741
Child's voice: <i> I'm scared.</i>

28:03.416 --> 28:05.115
(Alex sighs)

28:05.117 --> 28:09.053
Wearing these is just
as painful as being
punched by a Kryptonian.

28:10.589 --> 28:11.955
Tell me you found something.

28:11.957 --> 28:13.691
I got a couple of shots.

28:14.593 --> 28:16.493
What's in that iv?

28:16.495 --> 28:19.296
I'm guessing some combination
of sodium sulfite
and sodium iodate.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.466
The by-product of which
would be hydrochloric acid.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.435
She'd be melting into goo.

28:26.272 --> 28:27.905
Her vitals were stable,

28:27.907 --> 28:30.007
her brain showed
minimal activity.

28:30.009 --> 28:32.710
Lord's keeping her alive
somehow. But for what?

28:32.712 --> 28:35.179
We don't know.

28:35.181 --> 28:37.781
I'm guessing you
shapeshifted to get in?

28:39.585 --> 28:41.585
But that's not all.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.722
(Softly) I told you
if I used my powers
someone's gonna get hurt.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.024
What did you do?

28:48.127 --> 28:49.226
(Sighs)

28:49.228 --> 28:51.195
Something I swore
I'd never do again.

28:55.067 --> 28:57.634
Doctor:
<i> He doesn't remember anything.</i>

28:57.636 --> 29:00.738
We showed him photos
of his wife and baby and
he didn't know who they were.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.873
<i> I can't remember tonight,</i>

29:02.875 --> 29:04.808
<i> I can't remember last year...</i>

29:04.810 --> 29:07.845
There's been severe tissue
damage to his frontal
and temporal lobes.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.180
His memory's been
permanently affected.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.282
I need to see
the security tapes.

29:12.284 --> 29:13.884
We checked them.

29:13.886 --> 29:15.652
Someone wiped them all clean.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.154
Of course they did.
That's why I set up
invisible backups

29:17.156 --> 29:19.089
on all top priority systems.

29:24.497 --> 29:25.763
8:07.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.865
-I was out with
agent danvers.
-How?

29:28.934 --> 29:31.401
I saw you only
minutes before this, so...

29:32.638 --> 29:33.904
Who's that?

29:34.774 --> 29:38.108
Or, more importantly, what?

29:38.110 --> 29:39.543
You know, I never
should have
let you go in there.

29:39.545 --> 29:43.213
-If he would have hurt you...
-I'm fine.

29:43.215 --> 29:44.815
-Who are you calling?
-Agent chase.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.217
No. You know
they'll kill him.

29:47.219 --> 29:48.285
Let them.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.120
Let them.

29:50.122 --> 29:51.822
The world will be
better off for it.

29:51.824 --> 29:53.290
You don't want that
on your conscience.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.392
I'll find him and
I'll get him back to prison...

29:55.394 --> 29:58.028
What's the point, huh?

29:58.030 --> 30:01.498
There's something rotten
inside of him,

30:01.500 --> 30:02.866
something that
can't be helped.

30:02.868 --> 30:04.201
He's sick,
you said so yourself.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.303
One day he was normal
and the next he snapped.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.138
No, no. It can't
be like that, no.

30:08.140 --> 30:09.740
Sometimes that's just
the way it happens.

30:09.742 --> 30:12.142
Well, then what's to stop it
from happening to me?

30:13.679 --> 30:15.012
Huh?

30:18.884 --> 30:20.250
(Winn sighs)

30:23.622 --> 30:25.556
You know, my father and i
were inseparable.

30:25.558 --> 30:28.392
Like, we looked the same,
we talked the same.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.594
We were good
at the same things.

30:31.831 --> 30:33.497
And now he
says we're linked.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.865
Like, what if he's right?

30:34.867 --> 30:36.233
He isn't.

30:40.573 --> 30:45.008
His genes are like ticking
time bombs,

30:45.010 --> 30:47.311
just waiting to go off
inside of me.

30:47.313 --> 30:50.113
-Turn me into him.
-That's not going to happen.

30:50.115 --> 30:51.815
You're a good person.

30:51.817 --> 30:53.951
That's what people
said about him.

30:55.454 --> 30:57.120
And then he cracked.

30:58.591 --> 31:02.292
And now every time
i start to get angry,

31:02.294 --> 31:06.797
I think, "could this be it?
Could this be the day
that I lose everything?"

31:06.799 --> 31:10.801
Winn, the day that your father
killed those six people
was like for me

31:10.803 --> 31:13.537
the day my planet exploded.

31:13.539 --> 31:17.407
The course of our lives
changed in that single moment.

31:19.612 --> 31:23.547
You are not going
to turn into your father.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.352
Because the day
your world
was destroyed,

31:28.354 --> 31:33.090
you didn't give in to rage
and hate like your father,

31:33.826 --> 31:35.459
like my aunt.

31:38.697 --> 31:40.163
We both lost our worlds

31:40.165 --> 31:42.933
and now we're trying
to give back because of it.

31:44.837 --> 31:50.107
And you and your father
aren't the only ones
that are linked.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.111
We are too.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.914
And I'm not gonna let
anyone mess with that.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.615
Um...

32:00.352 --> 32:02.252
-I am so sorry.
-It's okay.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.987
-I...
-It's fine.

32:03.989 --> 32:05.956
-Winn...
-I'm going to go.

32:06.825 --> 32:08.525
-Winn...
-I'm going to go.

32:09.728 --> 32:10.827
(Door closes)

32:10.829 --> 32:12.396
(Exhales)

32:13.866 --> 32:15.532
(Muffled groan)

32:22.675 --> 32:26.410
Don't be scared.
I just need you to listen.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.480
(Stammering)
What do you want?

32:30.482 --> 32:33.016
What I wanted
for over a decade.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.585
To be your father again.

32:35.587 --> 32:36.687
Too late.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.291
In any case,
it's all dunholtz's fault

32:41.293 --> 32:43.527
and we're going
to make him pay.

32:46.031 --> 32:47.898
-Chester dunholtz?
-Yeah.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.933
-Your old boss?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:49.935 --> 32:51.868
That's why you
broke out of jail,

32:51.870 --> 32:56.206
so you could get revenge
on him for what, stealing
your dumb toy designs?

32:57.643 --> 32:58.709
No.

32:59.912 --> 33:02.779
No, this isn't about him
stealing a toy,

33:02.781 --> 33:06.316
this is about him stealing
your childhood.

33:06.318 --> 33:09.419
Stealing my chance
to watch you grow up.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.122
I went to prison
because of him.

33:14.026 --> 33:17.594
Winn, I almost lost you
because of him.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.665
But I have a plan
on how we can
make it right.

33:23.268 --> 33:25.435
You're going to kill him.

33:25.437 --> 33:27.637
No, I'm not going
to kill him.

33:29.208 --> 33:30.907
You're going to kill him

33:30.909 --> 33:32.376
for me.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.148
Stop. Stop.
What are you doing?

33:38.150 --> 33:40.650
We're looking
for communication between
winn and his father.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.085
We believe they
might be working together.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.488
No, winn would never do that.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.324
And yet he's nowhere
to be found,
today of all days.

33:47.326 --> 33:49.493
Confirm tactical sweep
of the convention hall.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.628
What's happening
at the convention hall?

33:51.630 --> 33:54.498
Schott: <i> Today is the start</i>
<i> of the national city</i>
<i> toy convention,</i>

33:54.500 --> 33:59.202
and for that I made you
this special gun.

33:59.204 --> 34:02.172
<i> You can take this</i>
<i> with you right through</i>
<i> the metal detectors</i>

34:02.174 --> 34:04.508
<i> and right past security.</i>

34:04.510 --> 34:08.245
<i> You can also take it</i>
<i> on stage with you</i>

34:08.247 --> 34:11.681
<i> when Chester dunholtz</i>
<i> receives his award.</i>

34:11.683 --> 34:14.985
Now, you'll walk up
to the podium,

34:14.987 --> 34:17.287
aim at his face,

34:17.289 --> 34:18.655
<i> right between the eyes...</i>

34:18.657 --> 34:20.624
-(Crowd clapping)
-Dunholtz: <i> Thank you.</i>

34:20.626 --> 34:22.559
<i> And thank you to</i>
<i> frank & son for hosting</i>
<i> this amazing event!</i>

34:24.696 --> 34:26.029
<i> This means so much...</i>

34:26.031 --> 34:28.098
...and you will shoot.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.466
I would never do that.

34:29.468 --> 34:33.203
I know. I know this is
a tough thing to do.

34:33.205 --> 34:37.607
So, I'm going to make it easy
on you by taking the decision
out of your hands.

34:37.609 --> 34:42.479
I've planted 10 bombs
in 10 different toys
at the convention.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.014
You won't know where they are.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.583
And if you don't kill
dunholtz,

34:47.753 --> 34:49.486
I'm gonna set them off.

34:49.488 --> 34:54.024
Dad, listen to me.
There will be hundreds
of people there.

34:54.026 --> 34:55.692
-Kids.
-Mmm-hmm.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.727
-They will all die.
-No, no, they won't,
they won't.

34:57.729 --> 35:00.297
Because you won't let
that happen.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.233
You are going to save them
by killing him.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.634
We'll both end up in prison.

35:04.636 --> 35:07.237
And that's what makes this
the perfect plan.

35:07.239 --> 35:12.609
Because whether we escape
or end up in prison
or what have you,

35:14.146 --> 35:15.712
we are gonna be together.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.216
How did this happen to you?

35:21.653 --> 35:23.920
Do you know

35:23.922 --> 35:27.591
that even with all
the amazing toys I've built,

35:31.530 --> 35:34.264
you're the best thing
i ever made.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.200
You're just like me.

35:37.936 --> 35:41.838
I am nothing like you.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.574
Don't underestimate yourself.

35:47.212 --> 35:50.680
<i> There's something unique</i>
<i> in a child's view</i>
<i> of the world.</i>

35:50.682 --> 35:53.350
<i> Something innocent and pure.</i>
<i> There is love.</i>

35:53.352 --> 35:56.419
<i> And a way of looking</i>
<i> that we as adults</i>
<i> tend to forget.</i>

35:56.421 --> 35:59.022
<i> We at dunholtz toys want to</i>
<i> bring this to the world.</i>

35:59.024 --> 36:03.894
<i> Each time you choose a toy,</i>
<i> whether it be a doll</i>
<i> or a figurine,</i>

36:03.896 --> 36:09.266
<i> a race car, building block,</i>
<i> you are beginning a journey</i>
<i> that's so...</i>

36:09.268 --> 36:11.568
Who are you?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.637
-What are you doing?
-Agent chase: Hey, FBI!

36:13.639 --> 36:15.205
I'm sorry.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.506
-(Exclaims)
-(Fires gunshot)

36:16.508 --> 36:18.308
-Agent chase: Take him out!
-(Gunfire)

36:21.980 --> 36:26.449
He planted 10 bombs here.
You have to find them before
he blows this place up.

36:32.257 --> 36:34.291
Schott: Natural consequences.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.427
-He's in the basement.
-This is gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

36:37.429 --> 36:39.396
Supergirl:
He's detonating the bombs!

36:43.001 --> 36:45.335
Everybody, move,
come this way.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.751
-(Beeps)
-(Loud explosion)

37:01.753 --> 37:04.054
(People screaming)

37:04.056 --> 37:05.355
(Ice shattering)

37:27.679 --> 37:30.447
You'll be happy to know
they gave me
an office upstairs.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.316
(Sighs)

37:34.786 --> 37:37.821
Lucy, catco's lucky
to have you.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.957
-So am I.
-I'm not going to step
on your toes.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.659
It never was about that.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.160
It's just...

37:44.162 --> 37:46.196
Your excitement about your job

37:46.198 --> 37:49.966
made me realize
i wasn't too psyched
about mine.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.737
And here I was,
thinking this was all about
our relationship.

37:53.739 --> 37:58.441
No, no, no.
I don't know what I'm doing
behind that desk.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.510
During the earthquake,
when I was out there,

38:00.512 --> 38:02.679
on the ground,
using my instincts,

38:05.484 --> 38:08.885
I finally felt like
myself again.

38:08.887 --> 38:12.389
You idiot, you just
hung your camera up
too soon.

38:12.391 --> 38:13.757
Might have to talk
to cat about that.

38:13.759 --> 38:16.026
Do you want me to put in
a good word for you?

38:16.028 --> 38:18.795
-She does have to take
my advice now.
-(Laughs)

38:36.782 --> 38:38.615
Hey.

38:38.617 --> 38:40.550
You want in on this
thai food order?

38:40.552 --> 38:43.486
There's, uh, potstickers,
peanut noodles...

38:43.488 --> 38:47.357
No, I'm not hungry,
i got a lot of work
to do.

38:47.359 --> 38:49.025
You're playing videogames.

38:51.396 --> 38:56.433
Your dad is back in prison,
we can go back to our normal,
toyman-free lives.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.701
I shouldn't have kissed you.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.503
Kara, I'm really sorry.

39:00.505 --> 39:03.306
It's fine, it doesn't matter.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.974
Of course it matters.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.412
My dad kept his feelings
bottled up for years,

39:10.682 --> 39:13.783
and then he exploded.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.355
Because he was a coward

39:19.891 --> 39:21.725
like me.

39:21.727 --> 39:26.663
Look, I know I dropped this
huge bomb on our friendship
when I kissed you

39:26.665 --> 39:29.399
and should have told you
how I felt a long time ago.

39:29.401 --> 39:33.903
But I was too scared
to say anything,

39:33.905 --> 39:36.873
I was too scared
to stand up for myself.

39:38.443 --> 39:40.377
Kara, I am going to tell
you the truth now.

39:43.248 --> 39:44.981
I'm in love with you.

39:47.119 --> 39:51.154
I have been in love
with you for a long time.

39:51.156 --> 39:54.057
-Since before you
were Supergirl.
-Winn...

39:55.293 --> 39:58.728
I don't want things to change.

39:58.730 --> 40:03.066
Before this thing with my dad,
i probably would have
gone along with that.

40:05.170 --> 40:08.238
God, I just would have
pretended that kiss
never happened.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.609
But I don't know if I can
sit and smile and eat
potstickers and pretend

40:12.611 --> 40:14.844
like it is not killing me.

40:17.015 --> 40:19.516
Kara, I cannot keep
bottling things up,

40:19.518 --> 40:22.185
I am too afraid
of what could happen.

40:22.187 --> 40:23.620
So...

40:24.423 --> 40:26.523
What does this mean for us?

40:29.227 --> 40:32.896
I don't know.
I don't know.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.633
(Sighing)

41:08.366 --> 41:10.400
Uh, did you forget
TV night?

41:10.402 --> 41:12.268
<i> Game of thrones</i>
and double-cheese pizza?

41:12.270 --> 41:14.070
Supergirl: Sorry.

41:14.072 --> 41:18.007
Just flying around the city,
i lost track of time.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.510
Everything okay?

41:20.512 --> 41:22.812
I screwed up.
With winn.

41:24.983 --> 41:29.052
I might have ruined something,
and I don't know
if I can fix it.

41:29.054 --> 41:32.455
Did he ask you out
or kiss you or something?

41:32.457 --> 41:33.823
-And you freaked out?
-What?

41:35.026 --> 41:37.026
How did you...

41:37.028 --> 41:41.397
I'm an elite agent with an
expertise in analyzing speech
patterns and body language.

41:41.399 --> 41:42.966
(Sighs)

41:42.968 --> 41:46.102
I'm also a human being
with eyes.

41:46.104 --> 41:48.838
You should have seen
the look on his face.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.241
I did that.

41:54.212 --> 41:56.212
(Sighs) Here.

41:56.214 --> 42:00.049
Here's to the danvers sisters.
We should come with a warning.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.588
I got Hank...
J'onn to use his powers.

42:05.590 --> 42:06.856
But that's great.

42:08.326 --> 42:09.792
That's not great?

42:09.794 --> 42:12.262
He won't tell me.
He did something.

42:12.264 --> 42:13.596
Like, something bad.

42:13.598 --> 42:15.031
And I pushed him into it.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.334
You? Pushy?

42:18.336 --> 42:19.802
-(Scoffs)
-(Giggles)

42:21.273 --> 42:23.006
Hank is strong.

42:23.008 --> 42:25.875
J'onn j'onzz
is even stronger.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.744
Did you get any intel on Max?

42:27.746 --> 42:30.647
I did, but I had to eat
slugs to get it.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.683
I let him wine and dine me.

42:33.685 --> 42:34.951
-Alex...
-It, uh...

42:34.953 --> 42:37.120
Alex, that man is a monster.

42:37.122 --> 42:39.422
You should have told me.
I should have been there
to back you up.

42:39.424 --> 42:43.326
Max lord is nothing more
than a reformed nerd
with a god complex.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.796
Just like every guy
i dated in college.

42:46.798 --> 42:50.300
No, he's not going to do
anything that I won't see
coming from a mile away.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.203
Oh, it's starting.

42:57.676 --> 42:59.809
Hmm. Sisters.

43:01.479 --> 43:02.845
How sweet.

43:02.847 --> 43:05.248
(Indistinct conversation)

43:05.250 --> 43:07.183
Good night, Supergirl.

43:09.087 --> 43:10.186
(Sighs)

43:10.188 --> 43:11.621
Enjoy the show.
