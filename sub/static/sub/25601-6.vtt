(hard rock playing)

00:06.240 --> 00:08.776
(motor revving)

00:12.012 --> 00:15.083
FX presents Snowfall.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.254
MAN: Get them all out of here.
NIA: Cops were clearing

00:20.288 --> 00:22.590
an empty lot in an effort
to make our city pretty

00:22.623 --> 00:24.658
in time for the Olympics.
Alton didn't want to leave.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.026
FRANKLIN:
Well, I give you the money,

00:26.060 --> 00:27.628
you just gon' go give it
to my moms?

00:27.661 --> 00:29.563
-No, no, it ain't like that.
-Been like that

00:29.597 --> 00:31.465
since I was old enough to know
what the word "deadbeat" meant.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.334
You want some good news?

00:33.367 --> 00:34.835
I moved that key.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.370
Valley is thirsty, amigo.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.172
Sounds like you knew
Alejandro pretty well.

00:38.206 --> 00:40.374
ELENA: He's my husband.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.376
(helicopter blades thumping)
Been circling for weeks.

00:42.410 --> 00:45.079
Only a matter of time
before they find us.

00:45.113 --> 00:48.149
One was a drug dealer
and the other was a woman,

00:48.182 --> 00:50.651
-and he killer her...
MAN: So you killed him.

00:50.684 --> 00:52.553
I had no choice.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.021
Handguns, assault rifles,
submachines.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.157
I only care that
you can deliver them

00:56.190 --> 00:58.559
-somewhere outside the country.
-Have a place in mind?

00:58.592 --> 01:01.229
I hear that Panama is nice
this time of year.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.668
(both grunting)

01:07.701 --> 01:09.570
(screams)

01:11.472 --> 01:13.407
LUCIA: (panting)
The way she held that gun,

01:13.441 --> 01:15.343
the way she stood--
she's a fucking cop.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.545
Or DEA,
but definitely the law.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.781
GUSTAVO: If she's a cop,
what does that make Pedro?

01:26.120 --> 01:30.090
(indistinct announcer
on radio)

01:30.124 --> 01:33.727
(typewriter keys clacking)

01:43.103 --> 01:46.607
(announcer continues,
crowd cheers)

01:50.110 --> 01:51.612
The longer I'm here,
the more questions

01:51.645 --> 01:53.314
I have to answer
when I get back.

01:53.347 --> 01:56.617
We're pulling you,
Lorena.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.921
(scoffs)

02:00.954 --> 02:02.723
Why would you do that?

02:02.756 --> 02:04.892
-You killed someone.
-In self-defense.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.794
Helped them dispose
of the bodies...

02:06.827 --> 02:08.729
I didn't do shit but patch up
that fucking bitch.

02:08.762 --> 02:11.999
You should have arrested them
right then and there.

02:12.032 --> 02:14.268
So that's what we're
gonna do now--

02:14.302 --> 02:15.736
arrest the Villanuevas.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.805
Whoever we get after that
we get.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.540
You take Lucia
off the board now,

02:19.573 --> 02:21.942
all of her contacts
get spooked and scatter,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.111
including the suppliers.
We still take a bite

02:24.144 --> 02:25.913
-out of La Fuerza.
-La Fuerza's whack-a-mole.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.949
The real prize here
is the pilot and his partner.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.818
Tony...
(scoffs)

02:30.851 --> 02:34.222
We get them, and we've got
a shot at the cartel.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.623
The fucking Colombians.

02:35.656 --> 02:37.558
Cover of "The Times,"
your ugly face

02:37.591 --> 02:40.294
and 3 tons of cocaine.

02:40.328 --> 02:44.465
You know this isn't
just my decision, right?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.334
You'll have to say
I wouldn't listen,

02:46.367 --> 02:48.402
that I refused to come in,
which I'm about to do anyway,

02:48.436 --> 02:52.540
so won't be that big
of a stretch.

02:52.573 --> 02:55.609
-How much time do you need?
-48 hours.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.845
Just enough to get
these assholes in handcuffs.

02:57.878 --> 03:00.914
Then we take the Villanuevas,
and after that I don't care

03:00.948 --> 03:03.817
how the dominoes fall.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.786
Please.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.655
Tony.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.357
(tense music)

03:09.390 --> 03:12.326
Two days?

03:12.360 --> 03:18.366
*

03:18.399 --> 03:21.869
(mellow pop music)

03:21.902 --> 03:28.776
*

03:31.078 --> 03:33.547
MATT: This is delicious.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.983
Wow.

03:36.016 --> 03:39.987
From Graves,
bottled in 1942.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.890
Even in war,
someone is making wine.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.393
I'd like to imagine
buxomy French women

03:45.426 --> 03:48.729
squishing grapes
between their toes.

03:48.762 --> 03:51.932
(song continues over speakers)

03:51.965 --> 03:55.436
LOBA: There will be a service
fee of 350 per shipment.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.237
Well, it was smart of you
to pour the wine

03:57.271 --> 03:59.072
before you dropped
that number on us.

03:59.106 --> 04:00.674
LOBA: Well, this is in Mexico
City, where the wind blows

04:00.708 --> 04:02.209
a different direction
every day.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.379
Noriega has changed everything.

04:05.413 --> 04:08.416
You are buying
the backing and security

04:08.449 --> 04:11.585
of the Panamanian government
from top to tail.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.921
Switzerland without the snow.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.423
Yeah, I appreciate
what you're offering us,

04:15.456 --> 04:16.557
that's why we're here.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.091
Now...
(clears throat)

04:18.125 --> 04:20.661
if I could guarantee
that this was going to be

04:20.694 --> 04:22.930
an ongoing relationship,
what would you do

04:22.963 --> 04:25.032
to earn my business?

04:25.065 --> 04:26.667
I suppose we could cut
the price enough

04:26.700 --> 04:29.603
to make you smile...
say 20%?

04:29.637 --> 04:32.072
-30% would make me smile more.
-(laughs)

04:32.105 --> 04:34.107
I cannot make you smile
that much.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.976
You provide assurances
with security

04:36.009 --> 04:39.046
-and handling of privacy, yeah?
-Total.

04:39.079 --> 04:42.015
If anything happens
to any of your shipments

04:42.049 --> 04:45.719
from port to plane,
we will make you whole again.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.087
Whatever it takes.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.257
We're not just
silk-glove handling.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.060
We're a peace-of-mind
guarantee.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.329
I'm feeling better already.
27% drop

04:55.363 --> 04:58.198
on all subsequent shipments.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.434
25.

05:00.468 --> 05:03.236
*

05:03.270 --> 05:06.106
So nice dealing
with consummate professionals

05:06.139 --> 05:07.508
for a change.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.743
Indeed.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.849
KEVIN: Corner boy's pulling in
5k a week over there

05:15.883 --> 05:17.985
-at Tommy's Burger.
FRANKLIN: That's good.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.588
Got me thinkin'...

05:20.621 --> 05:22.590
maybe we should start using
local businesses

05:22.623 --> 05:25.526
in the neighborhood, you know?

05:25.559 --> 05:28.662
Like that check-cash place
on 42nd.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.330
People can come in
with they paychecks and leave

05:30.364 --> 05:33.200
with that hard rock.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.670
Why you always trying
to make the shit more visible?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.439
What you mean more visible,
man?

05:38.472 --> 05:42.610
This is less pressure
on the hand-to-hand, off us.

05:42.643 --> 05:43.977
We ain't gotta
be driving around

05:44.011 --> 05:46.780
doing re-ups all day.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.215
Those places will all
want a cut

05:48.248 --> 05:50.317
for taking on the risk.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.285
Lot more than I'm willing
to pay out.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.121
(chattering on television)

05:54.154 --> 05:56.757
Think of something else, man,
huh?

05:56.790 --> 05:58.291
That's flashy.

05:58.325 --> 06:01.662
Yeah, all right.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.296
Ey, can I get
a Push-Up Pop?

06:03.330 --> 06:05.566
KEVIN: We closed, mama.
-Oh, then a Choco Taco

06:05.599 --> 06:07.200
or a Drumstick
with the nuts on top?

06:07.234 --> 06:09.637
-Sorry, we're not open.
-No?

06:09.670 --> 06:11.304
Not even for some of that rock
you got in there?

06:11.338 --> 06:13.106
KEVIN: Excuse me?
-Gotta give it to you,

06:13.140 --> 06:14.775
shit's pretty smart.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.710
I mean, who's gonna pull over
a ice cream truck?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.045
And I bet it's easier

06:18.078 --> 06:19.647
than slinging on foot, too,
huh?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.181
Not sure what you're
talking about, miss,

06:21.214 --> 06:22.850
-but have a nice day, okay?
-I'ma need you

06:22.883 --> 06:24.384
to come out here
and talk to me first, Franklin.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.720
(television chatter)

06:26.754 --> 06:29.289
It's about your father.

06:29.322 --> 06:32.325
(television chatter)

06:44.171 --> 06:46.907
-Who are you?
-Nia Jones.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.176
What you want with Alton?

06:49.209 --> 06:51.579
Cops are pressing charges
even though they're the ones

06:51.612 --> 06:54.615
who beat the shit out of him.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.153
Can't help you.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.555
Well, I checked
your mom's place.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.356
Should be checking
under overpasses.

07:03.390 --> 07:05.325
You know, for somebody
passed out in the gutter.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.228
No, he's been staying sober,
sticking to his program.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.429
Ain't missed a meeting
till today.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.431
-'Till today, huh?
-Uh-huh.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.366
You just said it.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.768
Shit always ends the same
with him.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.436
Maybe this time
will be different.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.205
-You're wasting your time.
-Look,

07:18.238 --> 07:19.607
if he's gotta fight this,
I need these forms signed

07:19.640 --> 07:21.141
and in by tomorrow.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.976
He doesn't, they'll throw
his ass in jail,

07:23.010 --> 07:26.013
and a black man with a record,
that's where he'll stay.

07:26.046 --> 07:30.450
Again, Miss Mia Jones...

07:30.484 --> 07:34.722
shit always ends the same way.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.257
He needs a lawyer.
Go ahead and get him one.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.126
He's your father.
You get him a lawyer,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.228
Mr. Ice Cream Man.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.296
(laughs)

07:43.330 --> 07:45.132
I'm gonna keep looking for him.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.467
You hear anything,
you know where to find me.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.137
Have yourself a great day.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.140
(tense music)

07:53.173 --> 07:54.675
*

08:03.951 --> 08:07.621
After Gabriella comes.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.390
Until then, everything
has to seem normal.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.760
GUSTAVO: Seem normal?

08:12.793 --> 08:16.029
What is normal?

08:16.063 --> 08:19.032
(somber music)

08:19.066 --> 08:22.002
I remember when my Dad
found this place.

08:22.035 --> 08:25.806
It felt huge.

08:25.839 --> 08:29.610
He was so excited.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.279
We all were.

08:32.312 --> 08:35.148
*

08:35.182 --> 08:37.885
I sure fucked this up.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.954
*

08:40.988 --> 08:42.489
You were right, Oso.

08:42.522 --> 08:46.827
I should have never
let Pedro back in.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.196
We can always run.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.665
Yeah, right now.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.667
-We'll look guilty.
-Start over again,

08:53.701 --> 08:55.903
-you and me.
-Spend the rest of our lives

08:55.936 --> 08:58.505
looking over our shoulders.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.642
I can't live my life that way.
(door opens)

09:01.675 --> 09:03.677
GUSTAVO: Seem normal.

09:03.711 --> 09:07.881
-(under breath) Motherfucker.
-(softly) Normal.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.717
Hey, I thought we agreed
to meet later.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.685
We didn't know when
the shipment was coming in.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.020
Wanted to be here to help.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.122
Sorry,
we should have called you.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.724
The white boys cancelled it.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.494
No, and Gabby's gonna be here
any minute.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.396
It might be better
if you two aren't here.

09:23.430 --> 09:26.934
-We'll stay if you need us.
-No.

09:26.967 --> 09:29.536
If they want us to go,
we should go.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.843
You'll call us
if you need us, yes?

09:35.876 --> 09:38.846
Thanks for checking in.

09:38.879 --> 09:45.418
*

09:45.452 --> 09:47.187
MATT: Hey...
number four, please.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.523
Hey, uh, you two go on
without me.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.092
Gotta see a man about a horse.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.593
MATT: Thought you were
coming out with us.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.028
Just leave a note
with the concierge,

09:55.062 --> 09:56.664
-I'll meet up with you.
-Panama City

09:56.697 --> 09:58.198
is a very dangerous place
to wander around alone.

09:58.231 --> 10:01.268
Don't worry,
Matt will protect you.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.436

10:05.739 --> 10:08.976

(man singing in Spanish)

10:16.684 --> 10:23.490
*

10:41.709 --> 10:45.612
Elena.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.782
Sorry I'm late.

10:48.816 --> 10:51.819
(music playing over speakers)

11:06.633 --> 11:08.435
What's my budget?

11:08.468 --> 11:10.704
400.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.808
No munitions, new suppliers,

11:14.842 --> 11:17.610
new routes, less money?

11:17.644 --> 11:21.648
Look, we are as committed
as ever to winning this war.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.984
This support...
is not going anywhere.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.285
You keep telling me
what you need,

11:25.318 --> 11:28.321
I'm gonna keep getting it
for you.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.971
The doctors in Jinotega

11:44.004 --> 11:46.740
wanted to amputate it.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.476
My leg, too.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.711
Glad we got you to Dallas.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.314
(pen clicks)

11:54.347 --> 11:56.316
(papers rustle)

12:01.321 --> 12:03.656
Okay. (clears throat)
So, yeah,

12:03.690 --> 12:07.027
that first shipment
should start arriving...

12:07.060 --> 12:08.862
in the next couple weeks.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.531
Our Panamanian friends
will take it to the airstrip

12:11.564 --> 12:13.633
in Camarones, and then
my pilot will pick it up

12:13.666 --> 12:15.535
and whisk it in to you.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.204
This new pilot...

12:17.237 --> 12:18.906
he knows how to fly low
and heavy?

12:18.939 --> 12:22.142
Yeah, he's flown dozens
of combat missions.

12:22.175 --> 12:25.178
So did Alejandro.

12:27.781 --> 12:30.517
I never got a chance
to tell you, uh...

12:30.550 --> 12:33.286
properly how sorry I was
about what happened.

12:35.789 --> 12:38.091
He was a good man...

12:38.125 --> 12:41.061
and he was a good soldier.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.033
I only hope that I can live up
to his memory.

12:49.602 --> 12:53.206
Keeping your promises
would be a good place to start.

12:56.476 --> 12:59.479
(engine rumbling)

13:07.387 --> 13:09.356
(speaking Spanish)

13:28.008 --> 13:30.377
What are they all doing here?

13:30.410 --> 13:33.813
Considering your accusation,
I thought they should be here.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.449
Avoid any confusion.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.088
(speaking Spanish)
shipment.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.190
Pretty simple, no?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.092
GABRIELLA: See, that's exactly
what I mean,

13:45.125 --> 13:47.294
'cause they say different.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.097
Stomper, Memo, and Stranger
left our place last night

13:50.130 --> 13:53.333
with the money
on their way here to pay you.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.135
They never came back.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.337
Maybe they went
to Vegas instead.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.839
Look, all I know is
that we held up our end--

13:59.873 --> 14:02.209
provided the product,
and it sold.

14:02.242 --> 14:06.013
Now we want our money.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.048
I don't think
they believe you, nina.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.749
I really don't care
what they believe.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.319
-Fucking lying puta.
GABRIELLA: Hey, stop.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.853
Everybody fucking stop.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.155
Get the fuck out!

14:15.188 --> 14:16.489
Everybody outside
but me and her!

14:16.523 --> 14:19.126
Go!

14:19.159 --> 14:22.329
(tense music)

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
Cabrón, get the fuck out.

14:24.397 --> 14:27.167
*

14:27.200 --> 14:29.169
Come on.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.204
Ay...

14:33.206 --> 14:36.143
You said you could keep them
in line.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.311
That they'd play ball.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.247
This is fucking bullshit,
Gabriella.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.382
GABRIELLA: You know, I didn't
grow up in this life.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.684
My father worked on cars.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.188
My mother at home
watched me and my brothers.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.857
I could have gotten away.

14:50.890 --> 14:55.028
Married a normal man,
been at home with my babies.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.564
Blow my fucking brains out,
huh?

14:57.597 --> 14:59.599
When I met Ybarra, I knew.
That was it.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.668
And when he went away...

15:01.701 --> 15:03.603
I wasn't scared.

15:03.636 --> 15:06.006
'Cause that's what I wanted--

15:06.039 --> 15:09.209
to be the boss.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.044
That's what you want, too.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.014
You wanna give orders.
You don't wanna take 'em, huh?

15:14.047 --> 15:15.215
I know.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.084
I respect that.
I get you.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.852
When I think about
the daughter I lost,

15:19.886 --> 15:22.289
what kind of woman
she would have been,

15:22.322 --> 15:23.423
I think about you.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.458
Only, I just--

15:25.492 --> 15:29.262
I picture someone
a little bit...

15:29.296 --> 15:31.164
fucking smarter, huh?
(yelps)

15:31.198 --> 15:32.632
Oh, yeah.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.601
Gotta be pellets,
a wound that big, huh?

15:34.634 --> 15:37.370
Fucking hurts, I know.
Whole shoulder on fire, right?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.772
You gonna tell me the truth
or keep feeding me shit, puta?

15:39.806 --> 15:41.441
They fucking came at us.
We didn't have a choice.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.176
Yeah?
Well, it don't matter.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.045
I don't make the rules.
We all gotta play by them.

15:45.078 --> 15:46.379
I'm sorry.

15:46.413 --> 15:47.847
-I'll pay you.
-Yeah?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.749
$1/4 million tomorrow.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.284
I'll need 1/4
for each shot-caller

15:51.318 --> 15:52.619
and another for me.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.387
That's 1.5, niña,
to buy your life.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.123
-You got that lying around?
-You kill me,

15:56.156 --> 15:57.824
-and the connect goes away.
-That's okay,

15:57.857 --> 16:00.260
I'll get another.

16:00.293 --> 16:04.431
What if I can offer you
something worth more than 1.5?

16:05.632 --> 16:08.168
The recipe.

16:08.201 --> 16:10.437
You cook the crack yourself.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.405
You think
you're making money now?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.974
You could have 1.5
coming in a month.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.610
Let's say I was interested.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.911
*

16:18.945 --> 16:21.881
The Monarcas want your head.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.451
I just need a few days.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.120
I won't be able
to hold them off for long.

16:27.154 --> 16:30.423
*

16:30.457 --> 16:32.592
You fuck around with me,

16:32.625 --> 16:35.095
it's not just gonna be
the end of you.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.030
It's gonna be the end
of every Villanueva

16:37.064 --> 16:38.365
from here to Sinaloa,

16:38.398 --> 16:41.634
the entire bloodline
wiped out.

16:47.174 --> 16:49.109
Feel better.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.712
(dark music)

16:58.785 --> 17:00.587
(woman calling out orders
indistinctly)

17:00.620 --> 17:02.655
Number 12.
Number 12, you're up.

17:07.194 --> 17:10.197
(women chattering)

17:19.739 --> 17:22.109
All right, I'm here.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.377
What's so important
it couldn't wait?

17:26.012 --> 17:30.083
We'll give you the vato
who killed your friends.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.918
Where to find him,
how to kill him

17:31.951 --> 17:33.353
so nobody knows it was you.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.755
LUCIA: No blowback, no war.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.425
Just revenge.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.893
I can also pay you
$1/4 million in cash.

17:40.927 --> 17:42.662
(laughs)

17:42.695 --> 17:45.765
I'm afraid to even ask
what you want in return.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.503
The recipe.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.206
-This is real, Franklin.
-Answer's no.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.574
GUSTAVO: You didn't even think
about it.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.444
I don't need
to think about it.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.479
I told you.

17:59.512 --> 18:02.582
I'm willing to make
as much rock as you want...

18:02.615 --> 18:04.751
but I ain't giving up
the process.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.921
-Thought you wanted revenge.
-Not at that price.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.857
Have a good night.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.592
Be safe out here.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.230
GUSTAVO: Hey.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.534
This isn't greed.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.270
We are in trouble, amigo.

18:23.303 --> 18:27.240
Need your help
to get out of it.

18:27.274 --> 18:30.810
When you needed ours
we were there...

18:30.843 --> 18:33.246
Saved your life.

18:34.781 --> 18:38.285
Maybe it's time to repay us.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.554
I'm grateful to you
for that.

18:41.588 --> 18:45.425
Won't never forget it.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.862
But this is the one thing
I can't do for you, Oso.

18:49.896 --> 18:52.799
I'm sorry.

18:52.832 --> 18:57.036
Really.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.972
Good luck.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.975
(tense music)

19:03.009 --> 19:07.314
*

19:07.347 --> 19:10.183
Let's see what he can do.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.766
(rock music playing
over speakers)

19:26.799 --> 19:29.769
(man moans)

19:29.802 --> 19:32.472
*

19:32.505 --> 19:34.774
(indistinct chatter)

19:34.807 --> 19:41.581
*

19:41.614 --> 19:45.017
(woman moaning)

19:45.051 --> 19:48.288
*

19:48.321 --> 19:49.456
(moans)

19:49.489 --> 19:54.794
*

19:54.827 --> 19:56.496
AVI: What's that?

19:56.529 --> 19:58.498
Housekeeping?

19:59.666 --> 20:02.034
(muffled music continues)

20:02.068 --> 20:04.203
*

20:04.237 --> 20:06.739
(whispering)
Did you say our names?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.708
-(softly) Uh, no.
-Did you mention the CIA

20:08.741 --> 20:10.176
-in any way?
-What?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.345
-Did you mention the CIA?
-No.

20:12.379 --> 20:14.447
Look, they were in the room
when we got there.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.949
-It would be very rude--
-It's fine, it's fine.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.218
It's my fault.
I should have warned you.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.020
-What?
-(whispers) Yeah, this is

20:21.053 --> 20:23.055
a big account for Loba.
This is his way of ensuring

20:23.089 --> 20:24.891
that we're never gonna take
our business anywhere else.

20:24.924 --> 20:28.395
Whoa, whoa--
What, they bugged the room?

20:28.428 --> 20:30.162
-(sighs)
-Also, I noticed

20:30.196 --> 20:31.998
that the blinds are open,
so I hope you smiled

20:32.031 --> 20:34.401
for the camera.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.403
(woman moaning)

20:36.436 --> 20:38.104
-Shit.
-You're still not grasping

20:38.137 --> 20:39.739
-who these people are, are you?
-(scoffs)

20:39.772 --> 20:41.674
Look, nobody here's
your friend, nobody here's

20:41.708 --> 20:45.378
ever doing anything nice
for you just because.

20:45.412 --> 20:46.879
That's not how it works.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.616
So, what, is this bad?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.320
-It's probably fine.
-Yeah.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.854
Unless you're planning
on running for President

20:54.887 --> 20:57.957
in the future.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.693
Okay, look, um...

21:00.727 --> 21:03.363
uh, you might as well
finish up at this point.

21:03.396 --> 21:07.700
Please be careful
what you say.

21:07.734 --> 21:10.703
(upbeat guitar music)

21:10.737 --> 21:13.740
(song continues
over speakers)

21:13.773 --> 21:19.912
*

21:19.946 --> 21:21.581
MATT: Hey.

21:23.516 --> 21:25.785
Was it everything
you dreamed it would be?

21:25.818 --> 21:28.287
It was...

21:28.321 --> 21:30.523
until I started thinking
about the guy

21:30.557 --> 21:33.059
on the other end
of the telephoto.

21:33.092 --> 21:35.528
Yeah. I bet that probably
works better than thinking

21:35.562 --> 21:38.498
-about baseball, doesn't it?
-I'm sorry.

21:38.531 --> 21:41.267
I should have seen it coming.

21:41.300 --> 21:44.404
Should have known better.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.172
Thanks, can we do, um...

21:46.205 --> 21:47.907
two tequilas?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.542
Dos tequilas?

21:49.576 --> 21:50.910
Expensive?

21:50.943 --> 21:52.311
Thank you.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.313
Your Spanish
is really coming along.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.748
Gracias.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.453
Do you ever think...
(clears throat)

22:00.487 --> 22:04.090
in a million years,
that we would be...

22:04.123 --> 22:06.993
in Panama City together?

22:07.026 --> 22:11.464
You incubating a nasty case
of Chlamydia...

22:11.498 --> 22:13.400
-(chuckles)
-While I broker

22:13.433 --> 22:15.768
illegal international
arms deals.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.771
No, but I'm having
a good time.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.773
(chuckles)

22:20.807 --> 22:23.843
Feel like I'm back
in the fight.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.912
*

22:25.945 --> 22:28.147
You know, probably
you could get back

22:28.180 --> 22:30.483
in the game officially...

22:30.517 --> 22:33.185
if you wanted to.

22:33.219 --> 22:34.654
I could probably even
get you recruited

22:34.687 --> 22:37.690
at this point.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.659
No chance.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.095
Right. I forgot,

22:43.129 --> 22:45.131
you got the whole...

22:45.164 --> 22:47.600
skydiving racket
to get back to.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.802
-It's not a racket, Teddy.
-Tell Dad about it yet?

22:49.836 --> 22:52.505
-Why?
-I was just curious how...

22:52.539 --> 22:55.141
he took the news that you had
completely given up

22:55.174 --> 22:56.543
on a life of service.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.945
How do you think
he took it?

22:58.978 --> 23:00.847
You know what he said to me
when I told him

23:00.880 --> 23:02.314
I was recruited by the CIA?

23:02.348 --> 23:05.151
He said, "Oh,
you mean those pussies

23:05.184 --> 23:07.954
who sneak around alleys
and stab you in the back?"

23:07.987 --> 23:10.056
I think you're too hard
on him.

23:10.089 --> 23:13.392
And I know he was tough
when we were kids, but...

23:13.426 --> 23:15.327
at least he stuck around.

23:15.361 --> 23:17.930
Yeah, I wish he hadn't.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.532
The fuck?

23:19.566 --> 23:21.000
-Take it back.
-Oh, fuck you, take it back.

23:21.033 --> 23:22.835
-Take it back.
-All I'm saying

23:22.869 --> 23:24.837
is if that asshole had left,
maybe Mom would have stayed.

23:24.871 --> 23:26.573
-Fuckin' bullshit.
-No, it's not.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.908
-You romanticize her.
-No, I don't romanticize her.

23:28.941 --> 23:30.309
I don't blame her.
It's different.

23:30.342 --> 23:31.878
-Maybe you should.
-I left as soon

23:31.911 --> 23:33.513
-as I could, too.
-You didn't have

23:33.546 --> 23:35.014
-two small boys at home.
-I got one small boy

23:35.047 --> 23:36.549
at home right now--
I'm not there, am I?

23:36.583 --> 23:37.650
-It's different.
-How is that different?

23:37.684 --> 23:39.218
You're in Paul's life.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.122
You know where he is
and how he is.

23:43.155 --> 23:46.058
She just walked out on us.

23:46.092 --> 23:48.761
Didn't even leave a note.

23:48.795 --> 23:51.030
That's unforgivable,

23:51.063 --> 23:53.432
and you know that.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.469
(mellow background music
continues)

23:56.503 --> 24:03.275
*

24:05.244 --> 24:08.548
To Mom and Dad.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.382
Fuck 'em both.

24:10.416 --> 24:11.918
Fuck them both.

24:13.252 --> 24:18.124
*

24:19.325 --> 24:21.828
Damn bills and shit...

24:21.861 --> 24:23.896
(television chattering)

24:25.598 --> 24:28.100
Damn, I'm gonna have
to put a bell on you, Peanut.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.903
-Franklin around?
-Nah, but you wanna leave

24:30.937 --> 24:33.940
some cash for him,
I'll take it.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.648
You don't trust us
or something?

24:41.681 --> 24:44.450
-No, of course I do.
-So, what, you ain't got it?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.686
It's nothing, I'll just--

24:46.719 --> 24:49.556
just hang out,
just wait for Franklin.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.958
(television chattering)

24:53.593 --> 24:55.828
(laughs) Oh, shit.

24:55.862 --> 24:58.931
-You got jacked, huh?
-No, I--I didn't get jacked.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.267
-Yeah, you did.
-No, it's just--

25:01.300 --> 25:02.802
it's just, like,
tied up right now,

25:02.835 --> 25:03.803
so I don't want
to trouble you guys--

25:03.836 --> 25:06.939
Spit it out, Peanut.

25:06.973 --> 25:09.542
-My dad took it.
-(snorts)

25:09.576 --> 25:13.445
Yo daddy, who you live with,
took your cocaine?

25:13.479 --> 25:15.648
Well, then take it back, boy.

25:15.682 --> 25:18.284
Fuck wrong with you?

25:18.317 --> 25:19.886
Hold--wait, hold on.

25:19.919 --> 25:21.988
That's that, uh, house
that Franklin

25:22.021 --> 25:23.556
used to stay at, right?

25:23.590 --> 25:25.825
Y'all make
your little nasty movies.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.694
(laughs)

25:27.727 --> 25:29.696
I'm gonna help you out.

25:29.729 --> 25:31.764
-We gon' get that.
-(stammering)

25:31.798 --> 25:33.199
Hell yeah,
I'm with that shit.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.634
Mm-mm, you think
I'm letting you up there

25:34.667 --> 25:36.135
with a bunch of white
naked bitches?

25:36.168 --> 25:37.604
Man, this about business.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.538
You're not going
to no titty house, Leon.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.340
Peaches, wanna go
to the titty house?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.709
-(laughs)
-Ey, Jerome,

25:42.742 --> 25:44.176
-you need my help, right?
-I don't need

25:44.210 --> 25:45.845
-a goddamn thing from you.
-What now?

25:45.878 --> 25:47.513
-Rob got jacked by his daddy.
-(laughing)

25:47.546 --> 25:49.048
What? How?

25:49.081 --> 25:51.383
-What, y'all going up there?
-Hell, yeah.

25:51.417 --> 25:54.186
-How much we talking?
-Like, two keys.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.757
LEON: Jerome, uh-uh.
-(sighs) Fuck...

25:57.790 --> 25:59.525
Hold up.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.193
He knows me.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.863
Pops know I'm the one
fronting the shit?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.634
(peppy percussion music)

26:07.667 --> 26:10.369
Who driving?

26:10.402 --> 26:12.171
-Leon, you coming?
-No.

26:12.204 --> 26:13.673
(man laughs)

26:16.242 --> 26:17.343
Uh-uh!

26:22.882 --> 26:25.985
(saucy instrumental music)

26:26.018 --> 26:29.956
*

26:29.989 --> 26:32.191
FRANKLIN:
'Sup with the spot?

26:32.224 --> 26:34.126
Things have been
a little rough since Mom left.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.562
What?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.265
-When that happen?
-I don't know...

26:39.298 --> 26:43.135
-Couple months ago.
-Ey, where yo pops at?

26:43.169 --> 26:45.571
Back this way.
They're shooting.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.840
(peppy music playing
over speakers)

26:47.874 --> 26:50.777
(muffled music continues)

26:50.810 --> 26:53.079
Ha. How y'all doin'?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.914
Hey, cut it out.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.383
JEROME: Man, you should go
get your dad.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.052
ROB: Let's wait 'till they cut.

27:00.086 --> 27:02.588
MAN: That's it.
Hold that eye contact.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.290
Hey!
(laughing)

27:05.324 --> 27:07.559
He's really not
gonna like this, man.

27:07.593 --> 27:09.295
-It's all good.
MAN: Nice.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.263
Your pops always treated me
like family...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.565
MAN: Move to your left.
-Gonna be all right.

27:13.599 --> 27:16.302
MAN: That's so great.
That's good.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.771
And cut.
That's great.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.242
Jesus Christ, Rob,
what the fuck?

27:23.275 --> 27:24.510
Hey, where the bitches at?

27:24.543 --> 27:25.945
There supposed to be titties!

27:25.978 --> 27:27.479
Where the fucking titties
and the bitches?

27:27.513 --> 27:30.983
-It's a gay one.
-A gay one.

27:31.017 --> 27:33.085
FRANKLIN: (sighs)
Mr. Volpe.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.054
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Oh, Franklin.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.089
It's great to see you,
really,

27:37.123 --> 27:39.325
but this isn't, uh,
the best of times.

27:39.358 --> 27:42.128
I think that Rob might have
explained that to you

27:42.161 --> 27:43.629
before you came
all the way out here.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.132
-We need to talk, Dad.
-No.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.700
No, we don't need to talk.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.168
I'm burning daylight.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.003
I need to shoot,
is what I need to do,

27:51.037 --> 27:53.105
and you need
to get these fucking people

27:53.139 --> 27:55.041
-out of here.
FRANKLIN: With all due respect,

27:55.074 --> 27:57.509
sir, from what I hear,
you may be financing this

27:57.543 --> 28:00.612
with something
that don't belong to you.

28:00.646 --> 28:02.114
Ungrateful little shit.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.649
The fuck you been
telling them?

28:03.682 --> 28:05.351
-Huh?
-Hey--

28:05.384 --> 28:06.652
(men grunting)

28:06.685 --> 28:07.954
JIM: Don't fucking
touch me.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.488
Hey, everybody
get the fuck out!

28:09.521 --> 28:11.323
Now!

28:12.124 --> 28:14.927
Don't do that, motherfucker.
(door opens, closes)

28:14.961 --> 28:16.662
-(men chattering)
-Uh, we're all right.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.297
We're all right.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.299
Well, you guys
just completely fucked up

28:20.332 --> 28:21.700
my entire shoot.
That's great.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.169
I hope you're all really happy.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.771
(door closes)

28:26.438 --> 28:28.540
Franklin tell you
about all the time he spent

28:28.574 --> 28:30.642
living here with us?

28:30.676 --> 28:32.444
How we brought him
into our home?

28:32.478 --> 28:35.181
-How we looked after him?
-You know I appreciate

28:35.214 --> 28:37.083
everything you and Mrs. Volpe
did for me.

28:37.116 --> 28:39.852
Yeah, and I can really feel
the love right now, man.

28:39.886 --> 28:43.722
You got any idea
how much food alone costs?

28:43.756 --> 28:45.691
Huh?
I mean you were a Shop-Vac.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.960
You weren't as bad
as Rob, though.

28:47.994 --> 28:50.562
Guess how much it cost
to raise Rob.

28:50.596 --> 28:53.232
I got clothes, I got dental,

28:53.265 --> 28:55.401
I--I got toys, I got trips.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.403
You got any idea?

28:57.436 --> 29:00.406
214 grand.

29:00.439 --> 29:03.042
-That's fucked up.
-You give everything you can

29:03.075 --> 29:04.743
to your children,
and what do you get back?

29:04.777 --> 29:06.545
Not a goddamn thing
in return.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.614
Hey, Jim...

29:08.647 --> 29:11.450
everything you're saying
right now is irrelevant.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.188
You know Avi
was my connect, right?

29:16.222 --> 29:18.724
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't even be in

29:18.757 --> 29:20.226
this goddamn business.

29:20.259 --> 29:21.928
What I'm looking for
is a little fucking,

29:21.961 --> 29:24.897
you know, gratitude.

29:24.931 --> 29:27.233
Where is it?

29:27.266 --> 29:30.436
Huh?

29:30.469 --> 29:33.605
Where's my coke?

29:35.607 --> 29:38.610
It's gone.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.614
So, if I'm gonna
be honest with you,

29:42.648 --> 29:44.817
what I'm looking for
is a little bit

29:44.851 --> 29:47.386
-of my generosity to be repaid.
-Yeah, well, I wish I knew

29:47.419 --> 29:51.390
your generosity
had strings attached.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.859
(clears throat)

29:54.660 --> 29:57.263
But I can see how hard
of a state you in.

29:59.098 --> 30:03.069
I'm sorry about that.

30:03.102 --> 30:06.272
How's a 50%
family discount sound?

30:06.305 --> 30:09.876
(Jim laughs quietly)

30:09.909 --> 30:12.845
Man, my company
is circling the drain.

30:12.879 --> 30:15.915
I can't pay you half--
I can't pay you anything.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.084
What?

30:18.117 --> 30:19.886
-You didn't tell me that.
-Why the fuck

30:19.919 --> 30:22.521
would I tell you that? What,
are you gonna bail me out?

30:22.554 --> 30:24.891
Huh?
All you ever done is take.

30:24.924 --> 30:27.759
That's all you've ever done,
take, take--

30:27.793 --> 30:29.828
Hey, hey! You stop
squirming, motherfucker.

30:29.862 --> 30:31.663
Now look,
you done took from us,

30:31.697 --> 30:33.699
you done stole
from your goddamn kid.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.603
Ey, come here, Opie.
Come here.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.071
Get your ass over here.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.911
-Slap yo daddy.
-Oh...

30:44.944 --> 30:46.778
Slap yo motherfucking daddy.

30:46.812 --> 30:48.680
Motherfucker
gon' steal from you,

30:48.714 --> 30:50.983
make you pay him back
for raising you?

30:51.017 --> 30:53.485
Smack yo goddamn daddy.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.888
Go on, man, smack him!

30:59.458 --> 31:01.560
Oh, come on, man,
you can do better than that.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.662
Smack yo goddamn daddy!

31:03.695 --> 31:05.331
-(grunts)
-Yeah!

31:05.364 --> 31:06.798
Let me show you how
to smack this motherfucker.

31:06.832 --> 31:09.168
You gon' give back
everything you took.

31:09.201 --> 31:11.003
That's how you smack.
You gon' give back

31:11.037 --> 31:12.972
-every fucking thing you took!
-Don't hurt him, come on!

31:13.005 --> 31:14.140
-Come on!
-(blow thuds)

31:14.173 --> 31:17.977
(indistinct shouting)

31:18.010 --> 31:19.578
-It's on me!
-Want more?

31:19.611 --> 31:20.846
-It's on me, I'll own it!
-Why you even care

31:20.879 --> 31:22.381
about this deadbeat?

31:22.414 --> 31:24.984
Because he's my dad, okay?

31:26.885 --> 31:29.155
I'm sorry.

31:29.188 --> 31:32.558
I'll take care of it.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.364
Hey, we still gon'
take something, man.

31:38.397 --> 31:42.001
Nah.

31:42.034 --> 31:45.371
Rob's good for it.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.039
Let's go.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.679
(Jim exhales sharply)

31:53.712 --> 31:54.880
(door thuds closed)

31:59.418 --> 32:02.121
-Hey, Lorena, you copy?
-Yeah, I'm here.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.590
Walker and Dobbs
are about to tap in, you good?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.625
-Need anything?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

32:06.658 --> 32:10.129
-Go ahead, over.
-Copy. Over and out.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.512
-Still nothing?
-(sighs)

32:26.545 --> 32:30.182
I'd be a lot less calm
if there were.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.784
Still no word from Lucia?

32:32.818 --> 32:35.787
-You need to relax.
-(laughs)

32:35.821 --> 32:38.590
-This is a mistake.
-They'll come back eventually.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.426
I'm not talking
about the suppliers.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.294
I mean not arresting Lucia
when you had the chance.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.763
-She's not going anywhere.
-How do you know that?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.298
She could be crossing
the border right now.

32:46.332 --> 32:48.067
She can't run.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.002
Not until she makes shit right
with La Fuerza.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.837
Gets that green light
off her head.

32:51.870 --> 32:54.740
And even if she did,
we'd find her.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.575
I just don't understand this.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.144
You have her for trafficking,
distribution,

32:58.177 --> 33:01.113
for fucking murder--
what else do you want?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.781
What are we doing here waiting
for these fucking guerros?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.017
I told you
when you first came to us

33:05.051 --> 33:08.487
that if you did what we asked
we'd get you what you wanted,

33:08.520 --> 33:11.257
and we will.

33:11.290 --> 33:15.961
She's gonna suffer in prison
for a long, long time.

33:15.994 --> 33:19.431
But right now, I need you
to shut the fuck up...

33:19.465 --> 33:22.301
and get on my page.

33:39.651 --> 33:43.055
(indistinct announcer
over speakers)

33:44.356 --> 33:45.691
-(door bell rings)
-FRANKLIN: Hey.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.493
MIKE: Hey, Franklin!

33:47.526 --> 33:49.361
Mike Cho, meet Nia Jones.

33:49.395 --> 33:51.430
-Pleased to meet you.
-Pleased to meet you.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.031
Place is filthy, Cho,
come on,

33:53.065 --> 33:54.666
MIKE: Broom's right there.
(Franklin laughing)

33:54.700 --> 33:56.034
MIKE: Franklin tell you
he used to work here?

33:56.068 --> 33:57.569
NIA: No!
-From what I hear,

33:57.603 --> 33:59.705
you keeping the job
in the family.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.042
She got paperwork for you.

34:04.076 --> 34:05.611
How'd you know to come here?

34:05.644 --> 34:07.779
Your son has some pull
in the neighborhood.

34:07.813 --> 34:11.217
Yeah, shit's time sensitive,
so y'all should get to work.

34:11.250 --> 34:13.985
Cho.
(laughing)

34:14.019 --> 34:16.188
When the hell you get
a hot dog machine?

34:16.222 --> 34:17.756
MIKE: Like it?

34:17.789 --> 34:19.691
-You make money off this?
-Yes, we do.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.228
(both men laughing)

34:23.095 --> 34:25.164
FRANKLIN:
What's goin' on?

34:25.197 --> 34:28.700
(conversation continues
indistinctly)

34:33.439 --> 34:36.742
I'll reach out
when I hear back from them.

34:36.775 --> 34:38.844
Thank you again.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.512
For everything.

34:40.546 --> 34:42.514
I'm proud of you.

34:42.548 --> 34:45.551
You're doing real good.
I hope you know that.

34:55.627 --> 34:58.197
Don't leave Moms
out to dry.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.768
(door bell rings)

35:06.805 --> 35:09.908
(Franklin sighs)

35:09.941 --> 35:12.178
-Want one?
-Nah.

35:12.211 --> 35:14.246
Don't know why
you changed your mind,

35:14.280 --> 35:16.982
but I'm happy you did.

35:19.151 --> 35:22.288
He's supposed
to be real good.

35:22.321 --> 35:25.624
Handles cases like this one
all the time.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.894
I've already paid his retainer,
so he's expecting your call.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.896
(sirens wailing in distance)

35:30.929 --> 35:33.299
So you always go out hunting
after all your cases like this?

35:33.332 --> 35:35.267
(laughs)
No, actually.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.935
Your pops has
a very special place

35:36.968 --> 35:38.404
in my heart.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.006
-My father was a Panther.
-For real?

35:41.039 --> 35:44.276
-Why they threw me his case.
-Damn, that's crazy.

35:44.310 --> 35:46.378
Where is he now, your dad?

35:46.412 --> 35:48.480
He died when I was 12.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.948
Got shot during some robbery.

35:49.981 --> 35:51.183
At least that's what
they said.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.752
Sorry to hear that.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.087
-So you from up North?
-Nah, here.

35:56.121 --> 35:58.290
-Baldwin Hills.
-Where'd you go to school?

35:58.324 --> 36:00.158
-Crenshaw?
-Our Holy Mother.

36:00.192 --> 36:01.760
(laughs)
You know Dizzy?

36:01.793 --> 36:03.161
(laughs)
Oh, Dizzy was

36:03.195 --> 36:04.596
my sixth-grade boyfriend.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.131
-Oh, man.
-'Till he dropped me

36:06.164 --> 36:08.400
-for Vonkeisha Jackson.
-Oh, she was a ho.

36:08.434 --> 36:09.868
-Right?
-Damn.

36:09.901 --> 36:12.137
-You do college?
-Went to Middlebury

36:12.170 --> 36:14.840
for a minute on scholarship.

36:14.873 --> 36:17.476
Don't tell me, you was
the only black person

36:17.509 --> 36:20.178
-in there, right?
-There were three of us.

36:20.212 --> 36:23.282
But I left after a couple
of years, ended up at Howard.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.150
-That was more my style.
-Now you're back

36:25.183 --> 36:26.685
-for good, huh?
-Mm-mm.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.587
Saving up for law school.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.188
Law school.

36:30.222 --> 36:33.091
Can't change the system
from the outside.

36:33.124 --> 36:35.994
No, you can't.

36:36.027 --> 36:38.464
Can I take you out sometime?

36:38.497 --> 36:39.931
Dinner, maybe?

36:39.965 --> 36:42.701
-A drink?
-I don't think so.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.770
Look, I get why you hustle,

36:44.803 --> 36:46.538
and I see what you want,

36:46.572 --> 36:49.708
but I've been there before,
and I don't wanna go back.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.578
I'll be seeing you, Franklin.

37:07.259 --> 37:09.495
What are you feeling
for dinner?

37:09.528 --> 37:11.229
Whatever.

37:13.164 --> 37:15.501
Burgers?
Hmm.

37:15.534 --> 37:17.569
Nah, not burgers.

37:17.603 --> 37:20.372
So, then, not whatever.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.541
(tense music)

37:22.574 --> 37:25.243
-Hey, man, office--
-Don't look at it.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.546
Just keep your eyes
straight ahead.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.581
What?

37:29.615 --> 37:31.182
You're 100% certain
you didn't say anything

37:31.216 --> 37:32.884
about who we really are
at the hotel?

37:32.918 --> 37:34.152
To the hookers?

37:34.185 --> 37:36.087
Yeah, I'm completely sure.

37:36.121 --> 37:37.656
Why?

37:37.689 --> 37:39.658
Somebody's watching
the office.

37:39.691 --> 37:45.664
*

37:47.232 --> 37:48.767
MAN: They just went past,
might have made my car.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.437
I've got eyes on them.
I'm following.

37:51.470 --> 37:55.874
*

37:55.907 --> 37:57.909
MAN: Copy that.
We're southbound on Arlington.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.244
Good, gun it.

37:59.277 --> 38:01.079
We'll pin them in at Imperial.

38:01.112 --> 38:02.881
Copy that, here we go.

38:02.914 --> 38:06.685
(dark music)

38:06.718 --> 38:09.220
And we have a tail.

38:10.622 --> 38:12.424
I'm gonna try
to avoid congestion.

38:12.458 --> 38:15.561
-Just keep an eye on our front.
-What am I looking for?

38:15.594 --> 38:18.063
Anybody trying to box us in,
like a van stopping suddenly,

38:18.096 --> 38:19.898
people jumping out.
What is this, like

38:19.931 --> 38:22.768
some sort or cartel hit squad?

38:22.801 --> 38:25.303
*

38:25.337 --> 38:26.905
Jesus Christ.

38:26.938 --> 38:29.708
Teddy, talk to me,
what do you see?

38:29.741 --> 38:32.210
There's two cars now.

38:32.243 --> 38:35.313
Leap-frogging.
It's gotta be the Feds.

38:35.347 --> 38:38.450
-Is your vision still 20-20?
-Why? What am I looking for?

38:38.484 --> 38:42.287
There's a blue Chevy Caprice
about five lanes back.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.422
I'm gonna try
to pull them in close enough

38:43.455 --> 38:45.924
for you to read the plates.

38:45.957 --> 38:49.961
*

38:49.995 --> 38:51.663
-Two occupants?
-Yep, that's it.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.500
Here, let me know
when you got it.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.269
-Yeah.
-Okay. Hold on!

38:58.303 --> 38:59.671
(engine revving)

38:59.705 --> 39:01.973
(horns honking)

39:02.007 --> 39:03.775

39:12.350 --> 39:14.352
What the hell is going on?

39:14.386 --> 39:16.121
(sighs)
I don't know.

39:19.525 --> 39:22.761

39:22.794 --> 39:26.131

39:26.164 --> 39:28.734

on television)

39:28.767 --> 39:30.368
(children laughing)

39:30.402 --> 39:32.070
(chuckling)
Uh, uh, uh.

39:32.103 --> 39:33.705
I done already told y'all,

39:33.739 --> 39:35.607
quit running around my house
with that bottle.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.975
Y'all gone get this shit
all on the sofa.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.276
Sit your ass down
and be quiet.

39:38.309 --> 39:40.178
KEVIN: Hey, hey, hey.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.880
What's going on, muppets?

39:41.913 --> 39:44.483
Who's hungry?
Come on, come get it.

39:44.516 --> 39:47.018
-Here, take that.
-Hey, baby.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.620
Thank you.

39:48.654 --> 39:52.323
GIRL: Want a tray?
-Hey, little mama.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.225
-Say "hey."
-Hey.

39:54.259 --> 39:56.161
GEORGE: Will you cut it out...
-I got something for you.

39:56.194 --> 39:57.563
Ooh.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.432
-We like that.
-Diapers and formula.

40:00.466 --> 40:02.468
I wanna see her
in her new clothes,

40:02.501 --> 40:04.235
-you hear me?
-Thank you, baby brother.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.737
(knocking on door)

40:05.771 --> 40:07.906
If this is Deandre,
I'm gonna be really mad.

40:07.939 --> 40:09.708
DONNA: Tch. Shut up.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.679
LUCIA: Hey.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.781
-You remember us?
-Do I remember?

40:15.814 --> 40:17.983
Is that shit supposed
to be funny?

40:18.016 --> 40:19.918
-Need to talk to you.
-About what?

40:19.951 --> 40:22.488
DONNA: Who is that?
-Oh, it's just some friends

40:22.521 --> 40:23.855
for business,
you know what I'm saying?

40:23.889 --> 40:25.524
Hey, make sure they don't
eat all my food.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.325
Please?
Thank you.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.461
(television chattering)

40:31.096 --> 40:33.599
You must either be stupid
or out your goddamn mind

40:33.632 --> 40:35.701
coming to my neighborhood
at this time of night.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.736
LUCIA: We have something
for you.

40:37.769 --> 40:39.404
It needed to be discussed
in private,

40:39.437 --> 40:41.272
and it couldn't wait.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.842
GUSTAVO: Wanna know
who killed your friends?

40:43.875 --> 40:46.111
LUCIA: We can take you
right to him.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.780
Show you where to get at him
and how.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.616
And why would you do that?

40:50.649 --> 40:53.318
'Cause you're gonna tell us
how to cook up that rock.

40:53.351 --> 40:55.120
Why would I do that?

40:55.153 --> 40:56.888
LUCIA: That recipe's going
to get out sooner or later.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.724
At least this way
you get something in return

40:58.757 --> 41:01.192
when it does.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.394
That don't sound like
an even trade to me.

41:03.428 --> 41:05.931
No?

41:05.964 --> 41:08.667
What else do you want?

41:08.700 --> 41:10.669
I have access to pure cocaine.

41:10.702 --> 41:13.038
Straight off the boat,
affordable.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.373
Smart man like you?

41:15.406 --> 41:16.875
No reason you shouldn't
be running

41:16.908 --> 41:19.945
your own operation,
if that's what you want.

41:19.978 --> 41:22.548
(suspenseful music)

41:22.581 --> 41:24.550
There's enough room
in this game for all of us.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.117
-Mmm.
-We can make sure

41:26.151 --> 41:27.786
you and your family
are well taken care of,

41:27.819 --> 41:29.621
and obviously
nobody would ever know

41:29.655 --> 41:31.156
this conversation
ever took place.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.460
