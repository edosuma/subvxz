WEBVTT

00:39.958 --> 00:41.543
It's time you met Luka.

00:47.674 --> 00:50.260
Knew this Ukrainian shylock named Bohan.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.012
Loaned ten grand
to this White Nationalist fuck.

00:53.596 --> 00:55.473
The day he comes to collect,
the punk can't pay.

00:55.848 --> 00:57.475
So Bohan gives him two more days.

00:58.142 --> 01:00.353
If he doesn't pay, that's it. He gets hurt.

01:01.604 --> 01:05.441
So, one day to go, Bohan's 15-year-old
daughter goes missing.

01:05.483 --> 01:07.694
Beautiful girl. Light of his life.

01:07.860 --> 01:10.530
So Bohan's freaking out.
Then he gets a call from white boy.

01:10.572 --> 01:13.283
If Bohan forgives the debt,
then he gets his girl back.

01:13.825 --> 01:15.159
Now, the guy didn't wanna hurt her.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.620
I mean, he's just fucking desperate.

01:17.829 --> 01:19.539
And stupid.

01:19.581 --> 01:22.292
So anyway, that's when Joe and I
get the call to find the girl.

01:23.042 --> 01:26.796
Bohan tells us,
"Talk to the girl's godfather, Luka Delchev."

01:27.171 --> 01:30.508
So, uh... we go over
to this fucking mechanic shop

01:30.883 --> 01:34.012
and there's this guy milking car batteries.

01:34.846 --> 01:36.514
He'd drill a hole
in the bottom of the battery

01:37.015 --> 01:40.310
and let the acid drain
into one of these five-gallon water jugs.

01:40.685 --> 01:44.856
You see, most plastics and polymers
are pretty unreactive towards acid

01:46.149 --> 01:50.695
but every time he drills the hole,
the acid ruins the drill bit

01:51.529 --> 01:53.239
so they gotta change it out every time.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.743
So, in the corner,
there's this pile of spent battery husks

01:57.577 --> 01:59.120
and these melted drill bits.

01:59.746 --> 02:02.081
I'm like, "Luka, what the fuck
is going on here?"

02:02.415 --> 02:06.044
And he tells us that sulfuric acid is great

02:07.337 --> 02:12.925
because it melts the skin and the muscle,
but leaves the bone intact.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.014
You see, the acid was for the kidnapper

02:18.056 --> 02:19.766
once Luka found him.

02:20.725 --> 02:23.645
He wanted to start at the feet
and work his way up.

02:24.103 --> 02:28.024
Now, he wanted that white boy
to watch his own body melt underneath him.

02:32.695 --> 02:33.696
Did you find him?

02:35.156 --> 02:36.741
That we did, yeah.

02:37.909 --> 02:39.369
The girl was fine, by the way

02:39.702 --> 02:42.372
but yeah, we found him, took him to Luka.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.583
Now we're taking you.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.382
I lied. I know where my mother is.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.259
Really?

02:55.301 --> 02:57.011
We were supposed
to meet at the Bridgeport Motel.

02:57.053 --> 02:58.346
She's probably already there.

03:01.891 --> 03:05.853
You know, Pete, I really thought
my story might spook ya

03:06.521 --> 03:07.397
but here you are

03:09.107 --> 03:10.066
with jokes.

03:10.692 --> 03:11.567
No joke.

03:12.068 --> 03:13.695
- It's the truth.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.284
Thanks, Evan. I really appreciate it.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.328
Come on in.

03:22.829 --> 03:25.748
Evan just called. He followed those guys
out to the highway.

03:26.040 --> 03:27.458
They're gone. You're good to go.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.420
I got it, thank you so much.

03:30.712 --> 03:34.257
What was that all about, you having a
brother that got his toe chopped off?

03:35.425 --> 03:38.928
Oh, I was just playing along
to keep her from pulling the trigger.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.890
- Our friend still there?
- Yeah, question is why?

03:43.641 --> 03:45.017
Sounds like you got a theory.

03:45.059 --> 03:47.228
Well, if he's checking to see
if we're heading out of town

03:47.520 --> 03:49.480
maybe she's still there, or close.

03:49.647 --> 03:52.316
I'm telling you, she's on her way
to Bridgeport.

03:52.567 --> 03:53.901
Yeah, sure she is.

03:56.696 --> 03:59.407
Let me out. He just pulled off,
thinking we've gone far enough.

03:59.991 --> 04:02.493
I'll boost the car, head back,
see if Maggie's still there.

04:02.577 --> 04:04.537
This thing's getting
too fucking complicated

04:04.579 --> 04:06.164
- just like I knew it would.
- Up here.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.089
Go on. Take the Maverick.

04:15.423 --> 04:16.966
You already gave me cash.

04:17.008 --> 04:19.343
Car belonged to my ex-husband,
just like the cash.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.521
Where the fuck is this guy?

04:31.189 --> 04:33.316
His truck's here, but he's not.

04:38.362 --> 04:39.447
Where'd you serve?

04:41.741 --> 04:44.410
You know, you can't hide military.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.748
Third Ranger Battalion, Iraq.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.878
I served in 'Nam, A Shau Valley.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.591
Shouldn't you be doing something else
other than looking for this jacket?

04:59.342 --> 05:01.052
You obviously have skills.

05:02.845 --> 05:07.141
I don't wanna do anything else,
and if we're done bonding

05:08.643 --> 05:10.019
I'd like to get something to eat.

05:10.645 --> 05:11.938
We'll come back after that.

05:11.979 --> 05:12.980
Yeah, sure.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.055
Otto?

05:46.764 --> 05:48.349
Please, for the love of God, Grandma

05:49.100 --> 05:50.852
tell me that wasn't you at Brett Woods.

05:54.355 --> 05:55.648
You hadn't called me back.

05:55.690 --> 05:58.776
- I thought I'd just go out--
- Because of your little nature walk

05:59.610 --> 06:00.695
you're a suspect.

06:01.487 --> 06:02.947
- What?
- The farmer

06:03.614 --> 06:05.032
- the one you had the chat with.
- Yeah.

06:05.074 --> 06:08.619
Turns out he's got a great memory.
Painted a nice little picture of you.

06:09.245 --> 06:11.497
Maybe I can put it on the wall of my cell.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.959
OK, so I went for a walk in the woods.
A hike, like you said.

06:15.001 --> 06:16.043
I mean, what's the harm?

06:17.003 --> 06:21.340
The harm is that the detective
found Winslow's badge out there.

06:21.591 --> 06:23.009
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:23.718 --> 06:24.844
- Is it?
- Yeah.

06:24.886 --> 06:27.680
Is it, Grandma? Cos there are fucking
chocolate chip cookies

06:27.722 --> 06:28.598
all over the floor!

06:28.639 --> 06:30.892
This has nothing to do with the truck.

06:31.267 --> 06:32.143
Grandma.

06:32.852 --> 06:36.230
Grandma. Do you understand
how bad this is?

06:36.606 --> 06:37.481
Hm?

06:38.357 --> 06:40.610
There is now a witness
that can place you at the scene--

06:40.651 --> 06:41.652
I took care of it!

06:41.819 --> 06:44.655
- How?
- I crashed the truck into another car

06:45.573 --> 06:47.033
same colour as the detective's.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.159
The paint matches.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.953
This way, you have an explanation
for the damages.

06:51.871 --> 06:53.331
I even filed a police report.

06:53.831 --> 06:55.416
If anyone asks, there's a record.

06:56.250 --> 06:57.627
You're outta your goddamn mind.

06:57.668 --> 06:59.086
Don't talk to me like that!

06:59.128 --> 07:00.671
What happened to the truck?

07:02.673 --> 07:03.883
Grandma crashed it.

07:03.925 --> 07:04.800
She...?

07:05.468 --> 07:07.553
- What?
- Yeah, I stepped on the gas

07:07.595 --> 07:08.930
instead of the brake.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.142
What the fuck is happening?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.227
Why the fuck is that weasel here?

07:15.603 --> 07:16.687
Fuck you, man-child.

07:17.521 --> 07:19.899
Hey, hey, hey! Children, stop it!

07:20.858 --> 07:23.444
Lance... Lance found a buyer for that, uh

07:23.861 --> 07:25.237
the crappy land that he sold to Audrey

07:25.279 --> 07:27.156
so all she has to do
is sign a quitclaim deed.

07:27.239 --> 07:28.240
That's why we're here.

07:29.533 --> 07:30.952
It's almost midnight.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.454
There's a clock on it.
Guy wants to flip it to some corporate client

07:33.496 --> 07:34.538
by 9:00 tomorrow morning.

07:35.873 --> 07:36.791
You get 10,000.

07:41.337 --> 07:42.296
Where do I sign?

07:45.549 --> 07:48.844
They say you can tell the
future with tarot cards.

07:49.428 --> 07:50.471
Tell me, Dolores.

07:53.265 --> 07:54.183
Where am I heading?

08:06.153 --> 08:08.447
♪ It's getting harder out here ♪

08:10.866 --> 08:13.995

08:41.230 --> 08:45.484
Hey, do you remember when I said that
we could split the 11 million three ways?

08:46.485 --> 08:49.572
Well, if you take me
to Bridgeport right now

08:49.613 --> 08:50.906
you can have it all, every cent.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.034
And leave my partner high and dry?

08:53.075 --> 08:54.326
You could do whatever you want.

08:54.910 --> 08:59.373
Pete, Frank and I, we bury more bodies
than syphilis in the Middle Ages.

08:59.707 --> 09:02.209
We got our differences,
but he's my partner.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.961
I'm not a fucking sellout.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.095
What the fuck's wrong with you?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.056
- Nerves. I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Not in the car.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.640
Alright, I'll pull over.

09:16.682 --> 09:17.892
Pull over!

09:17.933 --> 09:20.436
- Alright, yeah, I'm pulling over.
- Pull over!

09:21.729 --> 09:23.189
Better open the door, man!

09:25.483 --> 09:26.609
- Alright, coming.
- Hurry!

09:26.817 --> 09:27.693
Hurry...

09:28.194 --> 09:29.361
OK, OK, OK.

09:29.487 --> 09:31.155
- Open the fucking door!
- Out, out, out.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.990
Oh! Watch that shit, man.

09:33.491 --> 09:34.700
OK.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.452
Hey, hey, hey.

09:36.869 --> 09:37.912
Leave your... ugh!

09:38.079 --> 09:40.372
Leave your fucking phone.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.084
Take that... yeah, yeah.

09:44.043 --> 09:45.795
Oh, God...

09:45.836 --> 09:46.712
Fucking disgusting.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.698
Unless you're calling
to buy a very expensive book

10:14.740 --> 10:15.616
I'm hanging up.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.619
- They're taking me to Luka.
<i>- Goodbye, Marius.</i>

10:19.161 --> 10:21.038
He's gonna melt me.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.289
Is that what you...

10:25.543 --> 10:27.670
- I can call Adam and Nicole.
- No, not yet.

10:27.711 --> 10:29.672
I need you. I need you.

10:29.713 --> 10:31.257
I'm not leaving the bookstore.

10:31.632 --> 10:36.303
<i>Listen, I almost had Maggie but she got away.
I wanna use Pete as bait.</i>

10:36.762 --> 10:40.141
The problem is, is that Pete is on his way
to Sedona, looking for Maggie.

10:40.391 --> 10:43.561
- You want me to call Pete and get him back?
<i>- Yeah, that's all I need.</i>

10:43.602 --> 10:46.397
<i>And then I need you to make one other
phone call, alright?</i>

10:49.441 --> 10:51.318
Yeah, I'm with one of them right now.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.987
I don't know, some bathroom in...

10:54.405 --> 10:55.322
Motherfucker!

10:55.573 --> 10:56.907
- OK, this is my mother--
- Gimme that.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.325
She's at the motel in Bridgeport.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.494
<i>Get to the motel as
soon as you can, Pete.</i>

11:00.536 --> 11:02.872
See? She's there right now. She's there.

11:03.205 --> 11:04.582
<i>Pete? Are you there?</i>

11:19.847 --> 11:21.182
Don't flick your wrists.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.309
- They were locked.
- You flicked.

11:23.475 --> 11:26.061
You did it when you were ten.
You're doing it now.

11:29.815 --> 11:30.691
Hi.

11:31.692 --> 11:32.985
The fuck is a dead man doing here?

11:33.027 --> 11:34.403
- I'll just wait in the car.
- Stay.

11:36.071 --> 11:38.115
- I'm here about your money.
- What about it?

11:39.617 --> 11:40.576
That, um...

11:42.161 --> 11:44.622
thing that you, uh, had me do

11:44.663 --> 11:47.499
- uh, to help you--
- You mean the money laundering?

11:47.541 --> 11:48.500
Yeah, it's done.

11:49.460 --> 11:52.213
I had to move the money through real estate.
That's why Lance is here.

11:52.254 --> 11:55.257
I'm too tired to explain, but basically,
you sign some paperwork

11:55.591 --> 11:58.385
pay a real estate tax,
and the money is yours free and clear.

11:58.427 --> 11:59.511
Let's go to my office.

12:00.471 --> 12:04.767
I'm asking because Otto's my friend,
and you've done business with him.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.521
No, I can't promise you
there won't be violence.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.775
Ah, as a matter of fact, uh...

12:14.985 --> 12:16.987
Violence might be necessary.
You should know that.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.326
Thank you.

12:22.534 --> 12:24.745
Thank you.
Right, no, just give me the address.

12:24.870 --> 12:26.330
Give me the address. I'll remember it.

12:26.538 --> 12:27.414
OK. Good.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.833
- OK...
- You wait outside.

12:30.960 --> 12:31.835
Door open?

12:40.261 --> 12:41.220
You do good work.

12:41.929 --> 12:42.805
Thanks.

12:43.764 --> 12:47.351
It's my first felony, so beginner's luck.

12:47.393 --> 12:48.269
That's good.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.481
Because I need you to do it again.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.067
No fucking way.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.485
No, we're finished.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.613
In fact, if you need someone bailed,
you need to go to ANB.

12:59.655 --> 13:01.365
- Just one more time.
- No, I'm leaving.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.910
I'm not asking.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.510
- How much is it?
- Count it and tell me.

13:22.177 --> 13:23.262
See if our numbers match.

13:26.890 --> 13:27.891
I'll load them for ya.

13:50.205 --> 13:51.999
Your fucking mother better be here.

13:55.044 --> 13:56.795
I knew you were a shit-bird.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.965
- Mr Bagwell, I was, I was just on my way--
- Back to jail.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.134
I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?

14:02.718 --> 14:05.929
Name's James Bagwell.
I'm this shit-bird's parole officer.

14:06.138 --> 14:07.264
And who might you be?

14:07.306 --> 14:09.183
I'm someone who doesn't have
to give you his fucking name.

14:09.475 --> 14:11.977
- I suggest you keep it moving.
- Yeah, you said that wrong.

14:12.311 --> 14:16.273
What you meant to say was,
"I think I'm done here, Mr Bagwell"

14:16.315 --> 14:18.609
and you were about
to move your ass the fuck on.

14:18.776 --> 14:20.944
Here, let me just... let me...
can I just explain?

14:20.986 --> 14:22.404
- Let me just tell you about--
- What?

14:22.446 --> 14:25.366
Explain how being in Connecticut
violates the terms of your parole?

14:25.407 --> 14:27.117
- No, I just wanna tell you why I'm here.
- Yeah?

14:27.159 --> 14:29.203
Can I just tell you what...
You don't have to handcuff me.

14:29.244 --> 14:31.497
- We could tase you for shits and giggles.
- No.

14:52.101 --> 14:53.060
Hey, hey, hey.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.479
He's got kids.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.606
And I got two fucks to give.

15:01.026 --> 15:03.570
Let me do it. It's my fucking mess,
let me clean it.

15:03.612 --> 15:07.199
OK, old man. But you come back empty-handed,
I'm kicking in doors.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.092
Can I help you?

15:26.635 --> 15:28.762
Yeah, I came here for the jacket
you found in the Caddy.

15:30.681 --> 15:31.557
What jacket?

15:33.350 --> 15:34.226
Come on.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.145
You just got back
from the grocery store, right?

15:36.478 --> 15:40.315
You bought some of that crappy
store-brand coffee, eggs, oranges

15:41.275 --> 15:42.526
maybe some cereal

15:42.693 --> 15:45.112
the one with the chocolate Dracula
on the front.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.281
- Who the fuck are you?
- That's for the girls?

15:47.531 --> 15:48.407
Maybe.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.451
Jackie, Nikki.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.206
Come on, just give it to me.
Just give it to me. It's not yours.

15:56.415 --> 15:59.543
I don't wanna argue.
I don't wanna negotiate.

16:00.752 --> 16:02.129
It's just a damn jacket.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.424
Yeah, so why let your girls
lose their only parent over it?

16:08.969 --> 16:11.221
Mr Bagwell, I'm here on a family emergency.

16:11.263 --> 16:12.389
You have to believe me.

16:12.723 --> 16:16.143
Uh, allow me to translate that,
now that I am fluent in Josipovic.

16:16.435 --> 16:19.730
What you just said is,
"I'm in a jam with my hoodlum friend

16:19.771 --> 16:21.982
so I had some British lady
call my parole officer

16:22.024 --> 16:24.526
so Mr Bagwell can come down
and save me." Am I correct?

16:24.568 --> 16:26.737
No, I'm here to see...
I'm here to see my stepdaughter.

16:27.488 --> 16:30.741
Would this be the same stepdaughter
you called me about last week

16:30.782 --> 16:32.242
when you first rescheduled our appointment?

16:32.618 --> 16:37.247
The same stepdaughter who you said found
a wounded cat in the middle of the street?

16:37.748 --> 16:41.793
The same cat you had to take
to have a life-saving surgery?

16:42.002 --> 16:44.046
Cos you know,
that sounded like bullshit too.

16:47.049 --> 16:47.925
It's all true.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.427
You know, I don't think
there really is a cat, Josipovic

16:50.886 --> 16:53.222
and I'm starting to think
there's not even a stepdaughter.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.848
OK, now that's offensive.

16:57.935 --> 16:58.810
Un-cuff him.

17:06.109 --> 17:09.571
Now, there's one thing that I hate
more than a shit-bird

17:10.030 --> 17:11.657
- that's a deadbeat dad.
- Yeah, me too.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.783
You too? Good, good.

17:13.075 --> 17:17.246
So I want you to take me
to meet your stepdaughter

17:19.790 --> 17:20.707
and the cat.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.421
Let me... I gotta call my ex-girlfriend,
to let her know we're coming.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.923
Ah.

17:27.965 --> 17:29.841
If I show up unannounced, she, well...

17:29.883 --> 17:31.093
you'll be burying a body.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.596
- Make it quick.
- Thank you.

17:35.639 --> 17:37.391
I actually can't wait for you to meet her.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.601
Here.

17:48.485 --> 17:49.361
What is that?

17:52.573 --> 17:55.909
It's a secret list of Colonel Sanders'
eleven herbs and spices.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.035
The fuck you care?

18:27.858 --> 18:29.276
Shit.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.112
<i>What happened?</i>

18:32.362 --> 18:33.280
I lost Pete.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.991
<i>- Fuck you mean you lost Pete?</i>
- At the Bridgeport Motel.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.993
<i>His fucking parole officer showed up.</i>

18:38.201 --> 18:40.287
Bridgeport?
What, you fell for his fucking story?

18:40.329 --> 18:43.540
Yeah, I heard a woman's voice on his phone.
I had to check it out, you know.

18:43.582 --> 18:46.168
- He might've not been fucking lying.
<i>- Joe, we don't got Pete.</i>

18:46.209 --> 18:47.294
We don't got Maggie.

18:48.170 --> 18:50.464
Luka's not the most rational
fucking human being.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.381
Yeah, I know.

18:52.924 --> 18:53.800
What do you got?

18:54.134 --> 18:56.637
Maggie left Rosedale
in a green Ford Maverick

18:57.012 --> 19:00.599
only a quarter tank of gas, so I've been
checking every gas station along the way.

19:00.641 --> 19:01.516
Nothing yet.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.393
Hey, real quick

19:03.435 --> 19:05.228
<i>when I asked where Maggie was headed</i>

19:05.687 --> 19:08.315
<i>Delores said Maggie
was going to find her son.</i>

19:08.690 --> 19:12.152
Now, why the fuck would Maggie say that
when she left her son behind with us?

19:13.862 --> 19:15.989
Fuck knows, but I don't like it.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.660
How would you like to be more
than my liaison

19:19.701 --> 19:21.244
do some real police work?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.666
The results came back from the paint chips
on Winslow's vehicle.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.085
That paint colour
was manufactured specifically

19:28.126 --> 19:31.296
for the GMC High Sierra Double Cab
between '85 and '87.

19:32.589 --> 19:36.218
Run down every registered owner
within a 100-mile radius of the crash site.

19:36.385 --> 19:38.095
Driver could've been from out of town.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.681
Maybe, but we always start
local, then widen.

20:01.159 --> 20:03.453
You here to play the hero, huh?
Be the good guy?

20:03.495 --> 20:06.289
I told you, my parole officer
wants to meet Ellen.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.666
I can't believe you're smoking
in front of him.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.960
- Name is James Bagwell.
- Hi, Julia Bowman.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.920
- Good to meet you.
- There she is. Hi!

20:12.003 --> 20:14.965
Uh, by the way, the cat died.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.092
- What?
- Yeah.

20:17.759 --> 20:21.096
The surgery didn't take.
The stent was rejected or something.

20:21.138 --> 20:23.098
I don't know.
Anyway, it cost two grand to fix

20:23.140 --> 20:28.186
but of course, I don't have $2,000,
so now Ellen blames me for the cat's death.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.397
Ms Bowman, I think we're getting off
on the wrong foot here.

20:30.439 --> 20:33.567
- Yeah, wrong feet's all we got around here.
- I didn't know about the cat, alright?

20:33.734 --> 20:34.818
OK, hold up, you two.

20:34.943 --> 20:38.280
- Listen, has he been paying child support?
- Uh, when he works

20:38.321 --> 20:39.656
but I do everything by myself.

20:39.698 --> 20:42.033
- Yeah, that's not what I hear.
- Oh, yeah?

20:42.075 --> 20:43.702
- Guys, guys...
- What do you hear?

20:43.744 --> 20:45.704
I heard you had visitors,
visitors that spend the night.

20:45.746 --> 20:48.290
Let's take a few deep breaths here, OK?
Let's take a few deep breaths.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.625
- One visitor!
- I think it's time I meet your daughter.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.252
- One visitor! Just one!
- She's right there.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.588
- Your cousin Steve!
- Oh!

20:54.629 --> 20:56.965
- And he wrecks it, nightly.
- Steve!

20:57.007 --> 20:59.176
- Oh, whoa!
- Boom! Drink that up!

20:59.217 --> 21:01.219
Enough! Would you please step back?

21:08.101 --> 21:12.314
Alright, listen, this was a mistake, OK?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.107
I have other appointments.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.526
- We need to go back to New York, now.
- No, no, he's staying.

21:16.568 --> 21:18.403
- He's burying that cat.
- Excuse me?

21:18.779 --> 21:20.655
I mean... Ellen.

21:21.323 --> 21:22.199
Look at her.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.658
She's heartbroken.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.621
- Or Steve can do it.
- He's working tonight.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.083
You need to be in New York
when this is done, OK?

21:32.125 --> 21:34.002
- OK.
- You report to me personally.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.003
You got it?

21:35.504 --> 21:36.421
OK.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.131
If you want, I can arrange for a pass

21:38.173 --> 21:40.258
so you can see your daughter
on designated weekends

21:40.300 --> 21:43.053
but that means no hanging out
with the shit-bird friends of yours

21:43.094 --> 21:44.304
- you got me?
- Yes, thank you.

21:44.346 --> 21:45.222
- Is it clear?
- I'd say yes.

21:45.263 --> 21:46.139
- Am I clear?
- Yes, sir.

21:46.181 --> 21:47.599
- Look at me.
- Yes, sir.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.479
Nice to meet you, Ms Bowman.

21:54.231 --> 21:56.775
- You keep your nose clean, Josipovic.
- OK. Thank you.

22:04.908 --> 22:05.867
"He wrecks it"?

22:07.661 --> 22:08.870
Josipovic?

22:09.162 --> 22:11.248
No, that was a joke. It's hard to explain.

22:11.289 --> 22:12.624
Really? Now I'm curious.

22:12.666 --> 22:14.459
- Explain.
- No, you had to be there.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.171
Hey, do you think Taylor
could track a cellphone?

22:26.972 --> 22:28.181
Motherfucker.

22:58.920 --> 22:59.796
Where's Maggie?

22:59.838 --> 23:00.714
Who's Maggie?

23:00.839 --> 23:03.675
Are you kidding me?
She was driving this car.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.261
- Fifties, blonde.
- The lady said her name was Linda.

23:07.679 --> 23:08.555
Linda?

23:08.597 --> 23:10.348
Yeah, man, Linda from Rosedale.

23:14.477 --> 23:15.353
Fuck.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.367
Come on, old man.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.580
Stop being so fucking dramatic
and pull the gun.

23:33.622 --> 23:34.998
That's why we're here, isn't it?

23:35.624 --> 23:37.417
You understand this isn't personal, right?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.670
I figured Dad had a job to do.
He can't do it, so I will.

23:40.712 --> 23:44.424
You know, if you shot your gun the way
you shoot your mouth, I'd be dead already.

23:50.972 --> 23:52.265
Any famous last words?

23:54.142 --> 23:56.519
I was gonna ask the same question.

23:57.979 --> 24:02.567
Put the gun on the ground,
or I put you in the ground.

24:06.571 --> 24:07.447
Down.

24:07.948 --> 24:08.823
Down.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.286
You alright, Otto?

24:13.578 --> 24:15.789
Yeah, of course I'm alright.
I had it under control.

24:16.915 --> 24:17.916
Yeah, looked that way.

24:19.417 --> 24:20.835
No, no, no, Sammy, Sammy!

24:21.294 --> 24:22.337
No, no. Don't do it.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.090
Bodies, they're a hassle.

24:26.299 --> 24:27.175
You know that.

24:31.346 --> 24:32.222
Give me the keys.

24:49.572 --> 24:50.448
Let's go.

24:57.038 --> 24:59.874
Yeah, I see you two old fucks again,
I start shooting.

25:01.376 --> 25:02.627
Come on, come on.

25:04.087 --> 25:05.255
Come on. How'd you find me?

25:08.425 --> 25:10.760
- Huh?
- Called the Rabbi, got some info

25:10.802 --> 25:12.262
skip-traced your ass.

25:20.603 --> 25:21.563
Oh, you got it.

25:21.771 --> 25:22.647
Great.

25:23.064 --> 25:25.775
Yeah, I was just about to, uh,
I was about to print it out.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.863
Funny, uh, my grandmother
actually has one of the trucks.

25:30.363 --> 25:33.742
I didn't say anything before,
cos I thought she had an older model, but...

25:34.617 --> 25:35.577
guess I was wrong.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.454
Your grandmother?

25:38.038 --> 25:39.289
Yeah. Yeah.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.708
You wanna go see it?

25:42.834 --> 25:44.461
Get a closer look at the kinda truck
we're looking for?

25:45.420 --> 25:46.588
Sure she wouldn't mind.

25:49.090 --> 25:49.966
I'll get the car.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.184
Hey, Grandma.

26:49.484 --> 26:50.360
Hi, Taylor.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.571
- I saw you pull up.
- Mmm.

26:55.115 --> 26:56.574
This is Detective Joyce Roby.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.785
She's the fancy New York law
I told you about.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.538
Oh...

27:03.123 --> 27:05.917
- Good to meet you, Detective.
- Oh, please, call me Joyce.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.211
What a beautiful place you have.

27:08.753 --> 27:11.631
- This really a working farm?
- Ever since the Civil War.

27:11.965 --> 27:12.924
Wow.

27:13.174 --> 27:16.261
- Your family has some deep roots.
- The farm has deep roots.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.013
Our family came into the land around 1978.

27:19.639 --> 27:20.765
Bail forfeiture.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.267
Mm.

27:23.560 --> 27:25.520
I understand you wanna see my truck.

27:27.147 --> 27:32.277
I am working a case involving a 1987 GMC
High Sierra Double Cab.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.906
Taylor must've called ahead
to say I was coming.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.618
He texted.

27:41.202 --> 27:44.289
Grandma prefers Snapchat,
but I'm stuck in the past.

27:46.791 --> 27:47.750
Let's take a look.

27:49.252 --> 27:50.128
This way.

27:52.881 --> 27:54.799
How are you liking our neck of the woods?

27:56.134 --> 27:57.010
It's quiet.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.721
Must be a nice change of pace.

28:01.306 --> 28:02.557
What happened to your forehead?

28:03.516 --> 28:04.392
It's nothing.

28:05.018 --> 28:06.853
Had a fender-bender with the truck.

28:07.228 --> 28:08.104
You did what?

28:08.563 --> 28:10.648
It's nothing.
That's why I didn't say anything.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.150
I didn't want anyone to know.

28:12.901 --> 28:15.028
- What did you hit?
- Parked car.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.323
Pushed the gas instead of the brake.

28:19.324 --> 28:20.450
Not the first time.

28:21.659 --> 28:22.994
When did this accident happen?

28:23.494 --> 28:24.370
Yesterday.

28:36.591 --> 28:40.428
Taylor, could you go to the car and get
the list of High Sierra owners, please?

28:40.470 --> 28:41.346
Sure.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.565
- Mrs Bernhardt...
- Audrey.

28:53.733 --> 28:54.609
Audrey.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.278
You ever been up to Brett Woods?

28:57.987 --> 29:00.156
Oh, Lord, not since I was a teen.

29:00.949 --> 29:02.700
Used to be the big make-out spot.

29:03.159 --> 29:06.663
Now it's big with the senior citizens'
bird watching centre.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.166
I was up there recently,
looking into a crash site

29:10.500 --> 29:11.542
connected with my case.

29:12.377 --> 29:16.172
The cars involved,
one was a small silver sedan

29:16.839 --> 29:19.509
the other, probably a GMC truck
like this one.

29:21.678 --> 29:25.682
Now, the reason I ask
is because the farmer who owns the land

29:26.307 --> 29:30.311
mentioned seeing a woman
matching your description up there.

29:31.688 --> 29:35.775
Must've been a bird watcher.
Us seniors all look alike.

29:39.070 --> 29:43.157
You said Taylor texted you.
When was the last time you two spoke?

29:43.616 --> 29:46.953
Sunday night.
Family gets together for dinner every week.

29:48.705 --> 29:49.706
Got the list.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.084
I'll look at it in the car.

29:54.252 --> 29:56.087
- Thanks for your time, Audrey.
- Oh, my pleasure.

29:56.129 --> 29:59.007
Oh, would you like
my phone number? Email?

29:59.882 --> 30:00.758
No.

30:01.384 --> 30:04.262
Anything comes up, I'll track you down.

30:12.770 --> 30:13.855
She's a lovely woman.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.277
How often do you get to see her?

30:20.361 --> 30:23.156
Sunday nights. Mandatory family dinner.

30:24.907 --> 30:25.783
Why?

30:27.535 --> 30:29.329
If she's hitting the gas
instead of the brakes

30:29.370 --> 30:30.955
you might wanna visit her more often.

30:40.340 --> 30:41.215
Jesus.

30:42.091 --> 30:43.134
Looks like crap.

30:44.135 --> 30:45.261
Wake him up. Wake him.

30:50.767 --> 30:51.976
- Hey, Moe.
- Moe?

30:53.561 --> 30:54.520
Poke him. Poke him.

30:59.442 --> 31:00.318
Alright?

31:04.113 --> 31:05.448
- Hey, Moe.
- Hey, Moe.

31:06.407 --> 31:07.283
Water.

31:11.871 --> 31:12.747
Here ya go.

31:13.331 --> 31:14.457
Here, got it, got it?

31:14.791 --> 31:15.666
There ya are.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.169
You're looking better, slowly.

31:23.758 --> 31:24.884
You're still looking better.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.679
We just came to tell you
we took care of the car.

31:29.097 --> 31:32.475
We met the punk that did this,
and he got what he wanted.

31:34.769 --> 31:36.604
Heard he took my Proclamation.

31:39.273 --> 31:41.859
The Easter Proclamation that I gave you?

31:44.529 --> 31:45.988
That little fuck.

31:48.199 --> 31:50.952
- Hey, I just need to talk to my cousin--
- Hey, hey!

31:50.993 --> 31:52.245
- Hey!
- Taylor.

32:04.340 --> 32:06.926
- Fucking shitting me?
- I just need a favour from you.

32:06.968 --> 32:07.844
Of course you do.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.013
- What?
- OK.

32:11.681 --> 32:13.766
I need to track a cellphone.

32:14.183 --> 32:16.853
A girl slept over last night,
she took money off me.

32:16.936 --> 32:18.479
- Can you believe that?
- I don't give a fuck

32:18.521 --> 32:19.439
about your girlfriend.

32:19.897 --> 32:20.773
Excuse me.

32:21.065 --> 32:22.233
You recognise this man?

32:22.692 --> 32:24.652
His name's Marius Josipovic.

32:29.031 --> 32:30.825
Nah, I... no, I've never seen him.

32:31.534 --> 32:33.786
Alright, well, keep that.
Apparently Winslow was tracking him.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.246
You see him, you let me know.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.790
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I wanna talk to him.

32:47.758 --> 32:50.011
This the guy you had in your fucking motel?

32:51.387 --> 32:53.514
- Huh?
- Yeah, he, he took off.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.766
He's in Ottawa. He's not coming back.

32:56.726 --> 32:57.894
You always got an answer.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.228
- Listen--
- Just go.

32:59.270 --> 33:00.313
Just fucking go.

33:00.646 --> 33:01.856
Hey, we need to talk.

33:05.276 --> 33:08.571
That kid you beat the crap out of, Avon?
We got movement on the case.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.573
- What kinda movement?
- The kind that keeps me up at night.

33:10.615 --> 33:12.533
DA wants to sit down with you next week.

33:12.825 --> 33:16.245
- We need to nail your story down, come on.
- Fuck.

33:20.041 --> 33:22.335
That's an awful strange colour for whiskey.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.587
It's coming, you damn drunk.

33:25.880 --> 33:30.051
You remember that, uh, tiger piss
we used to drink at Firebase Ripcord?

33:30.092 --> 33:31.928
<i>Ba Mui Ba.</i>

33:32.178 --> 33:34.222
Tasted better coming up than going down.

33:35.348 --> 33:39.936
That Proclamation started the Irish War
of Independence against the British.

33:40.144 --> 33:42.396
That piece of paper was over 100 years old.

33:43.189 --> 33:45.942
Otto, as your pal, as my pal

33:46.651 --> 33:48.528
I'm asking you, don't go after him.

33:48.736 --> 33:50.488
Let sleeping assholes lie.

33:50.530 --> 33:52.156
- Yeah.
- Can I join?

33:52.740 --> 33:56.369
- Unless you're talking about the war again.
- I hate being predictable.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.788
- Hey, she can't be here.
- What?

33:58.829 --> 34:00.081
Unless she orders food.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.708
What has this girl ever
done to deserve that?

34:03.084 --> 34:04.377
She orders, or she goes.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.963
Just bring her some sliders.

34:07.547 --> 34:09.048
We'll use them as coasters.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.510
So, what's going on?

34:12.552 --> 34:15.179
I had a long talk with Taylor
about our parents, y'know

34:15.221 --> 34:16.097
their, um...

34:16.764 --> 34:20.935
their death, and I realised that
that was the first time

34:20.977 --> 34:22.979
that anyone has ever talked
to me about them.

34:23.312 --> 34:26.732
Like, OK, here you guys are,
y'know, telling each other stories

34:27.024 --> 34:29.944
sharing memories, you know?

34:29.986 --> 34:33.030
I mean, no one has ever done that with me,
not about Mum and Dad.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.073
And...

34:34.699 --> 34:36.409
I mean, everyone remembers them.

34:36.450 --> 34:39.161
Like, even Sam got to work with them,
y'know? I...

34:39.704 --> 34:41.956
I have nothing.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.919
Well...

34:48.212 --> 34:50.256
your mum and dad met at the bond shop.

34:51.799 --> 34:53.259
- Really?
- That's wrong.

34:53.551 --> 34:56.262
When Danny walked in,
Lila was just running out the back.

34:56.304 --> 34:59.015
Yeah, no, no, yeah,
but it started in the shop.

34:59.056 --> 35:01.475
Technically, they met outside the shop.

35:01.517 --> 35:05.187
Anyway, it involved a two-block chase

35:05.646 --> 35:09.025
which ended when your mother
bonked your father with her gun.

35:09.066 --> 35:10.943
What?

35:27.293 --> 35:28.669
You shoot a good stick.

35:28.919 --> 35:29.795
I'm alright.

35:33.507 --> 35:35.051
You probably don't remember me, but, um

35:36.093 --> 35:38.179
I was there that night at Bruno's.

35:39.138 --> 35:40.556
- Fight with the cop.
- Yeah?

35:42.683 --> 35:43.684
Yeah.

35:44.769 --> 35:47.104
That, uh. That cop's my cousin.

35:49.857 --> 35:51.108
The fuck you want?

35:52.943 --> 35:58.199
I just came by to see if, uh, if maybe
you'd be willing to drop the charges.

36:00.368 --> 36:03.412
Boy coming up in here
like he's motherfucking John Wick.

36:03.454 --> 36:05.539
- No, no, no.
- "Drop the charges."

36:05.581 --> 36:07.208
- I'm not...
- Get the fuck outta here.

36:11.420 --> 36:14.006
One game, straight pool.
If I win, you drop the charges.

36:14.048 --> 36:16.801
If I lose, you get all that money.

36:18.678 --> 36:19.553
Rack 'em up.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.516
Do you mind if I hit a couple balls?

36:23.557 --> 36:26.394
It's been a long time since I've played.
I'm a little out of practice.

36:27.478 --> 36:28.479

37:58.319 --> 37:59.195
Thank you.

38:01.447 --> 38:03.866
I'm sorry. You know,
I think we got off to a bad start.

38:03.908 --> 38:04.909
Indeed we did.

38:05.284 --> 38:08.204
My name's Joe Hooper.
I just wanted to check on my buddy's arrest.

38:08.245 --> 38:09.455
Nobody's been arrested.

38:10.039 --> 38:12.041
Wait, Pete didn't violate his parole?

38:12.458 --> 38:14.919
- You know where I could find him?
- Look, I don't know any Pete

38:15.211 --> 38:16.420
but I do know two things.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.048
One, you have never been anybody's friend

38:19.632 --> 38:21.175
and two, you look like trouble.

38:22.635 --> 38:26.013
And if my clients want to associate
with the likes of you

38:26.055 --> 38:28.390
and ruin their second chances,
I can't stop 'em

38:28.682 --> 38:30.768
but it doesn't mean
I have to help them do it.

38:32.353 --> 38:33.604
You have a blessed day, brother.

38:42.279 --> 38:43.614
I thought I ran you out of town.

38:44.240 --> 38:47.952
I just came to congratulate you.
I heard, uh, Avon dropped the charges.

38:48.327 --> 38:49.203
How'd you know?

38:51.831 --> 38:53.207
You have something to do with that?

39:00.381 --> 39:01.674
You pay him off or something?

39:01.715 --> 39:02.800
Why're you so angry?

39:02.842 --> 39:05.761
I just heard he came into a little bit
of money, that's all.

39:05.803 --> 39:08.764
- That's fucking bribery.
- Case was civil, not criminal

39:09.265 --> 39:12.351
so it was essentially like a settlement.
Don't worry about it, you're fine.

39:15.688 --> 39:17.106
So, when are you back on the street?

39:18.941 --> 39:19.859
'Bout a week.

39:20.693 --> 39:21.735
Good. That's good.

39:25.573 --> 39:26.615
About that favour.

39:28.617 --> 39:30.327
I knew, I fucking... I knew it.

39:30.369 --> 39:33.747
You never do anything if it's not gonna
line your own fucking pockets.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.666
- It's just family helping family.
- Right.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.462
Thanks, Bucket. I owe you one.

39:43.591 --> 39:45.384
So, this young lady you're looking for

39:45.885 --> 39:48.345
she a Native American or a gambler?

39:50.097 --> 39:50.973
Why?

40:09.825 --> 40:10.701
Hey.

40:12.286 --> 40:13.203
You remember me?

40:18.250 --> 40:19.126
Thank God.

40:20.502 --> 40:21.420
Hey, um...

40:21.462 --> 40:25.215
she said if I needed to find her
to come to you.

40:28.928 --> 40:31.513
Someone's been calling.
Got a feeling it might be her.

40:35.476 --> 40:37.102
I've been calling for hours.

40:38.437 --> 40:39.438
<i>Been a long time.</i>

40:40.314 --> 40:41.315
Can you blame me?

40:42.775 --> 40:44.485
No, I guess not. Is he there?

40:45.945 --> 40:46.820
Hold on.

40:53.243 --> 40:54.119
Heya, Ma.

40:57.706 --> 40:59.416
I used to really like this job.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.128
Sh...

41:03.921 --> 41:06.757
Meet a lot of colourful people,
see a little action

41:07.299 --> 41:08.467
use the brain a bit.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.596
Now the nerves got me on the can
every 15 minutes.

41:14.556 --> 41:16.475
If I knew it was gonna go off
the fucking rails like this

41:16.517 --> 41:17.518
I never would've...

41:18.727 --> 41:20.020
Fuck Maggie. Fuck Pete.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.565
You wanna hear something weird?

41:25.651 --> 41:26.986
I don't even think he's Pete.

41:28.737 --> 41:31.115
I think he was telling us the truth
when we first snatched him.

41:32.950 --> 41:33.826
Keep talking.

41:35.703 --> 41:38.455
When we take on a case,
what's rule number one?

41:39.123 --> 41:40.624
Always follow the clues.

41:41.291 --> 41:42.167
What do we have?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.337
The old lady got him talking
about his brother.

41:45.671 --> 41:46.630
Very convincing.

41:47.006 --> 41:49.008
Only thing, Pete doesn't have a brother.

41:49.925 --> 41:51.677
Then that psychic chick told you

41:54.096 --> 41:58.058
Maggie went to look for her son,
but he's in Rosedale.

41:58.809 --> 41:59.810
Makes no sense.

42:00.602 --> 42:05.024
Finally, his parole officer
says he doesn't even know a Pete.

42:06.025 --> 42:07.109
What the fuck is that?

42:11.864 --> 42:15.451
Well, if he's not Pete, why say he's Pete?

42:16.744 --> 42:17.619
Money.

42:19.663 --> 42:24.543
Well, if he's fake Pete,
how did he trick real Pete's mum?

42:25.544 --> 42:28.422
She recognised him.
They had a conversation.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.299
And where the fuck is Pete?

42:31.091 --> 42:31.967
Good point.

42:33.719 --> 42:36.805
You know, if he's not Pete, we're fucked.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.348
Luka will kill us.

42:39.767 --> 42:40.642
You know this.

42:42.978 --> 42:46.106
When we see Luka today,
I think we should fucking kill him.

42:46.774 --> 42:49.526
Just go to the storage,
and put a bullet in his fucking head.

42:52.988 --> 42:55.032
I'm not dying in a vat of acid.

43:00.829 --> 43:01.705
What's wrong?

43:01.747 --> 43:03.248
Nothing. Nothing.

43:04.750 --> 43:05.667
Well, I don't know.

43:08.212 --> 43:10.589
Did Roby ask you about
the last time we spoke?

43:10.631 --> 43:12.132
- She did.
<i>- She asked me the same thing.</i>

43:12.174 --> 43:14.134
She's looking for discrepancies
in our stories.

43:14.176 --> 43:17.513
<i>She also asked about Brett Woods
while you were at the car.</i>

43:18.472 --> 43:19.890
I think she suspects something.

43:20.349 --> 43:22.309
Yeah, well, if she does,
she's playing it cool.

43:23.644 --> 43:25.104
But she's not at the station.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.065
- What does that mean?
<i>- Not sure.</i>

43:29.149 --> 43:31.735
But if I were her, I'd go back to the farm
to talk to you alone.

43:31.777 --> 43:34.738
<i>You should go to the office.
I'll go to the farm, see if she shows.</i>

43:34.780 --> 43:35.656
You sure?

43:35.697 --> 43:38.575
No, but it's the only idea I got.

43:44.540 --> 43:45.707
Just give me one second.

43:55.968 --> 43:57.344
- Pete.
<i>- Marius, listen.</i>

43:57.386 --> 44:00.139
I gotta make this quick.
She didn't want me calling you.

44:00.389 --> 44:03.058
- She's got a guy watching me--
- Uh, who didn't want you?

44:03.100 --> 44:03.976
<i>My mum.</i>

44:04.351 --> 44:05.394
<i>I found my mum.</i>

44:05.435 --> 44:08.522
- Where, where'd you find her?
<i>- We're gonna disappear, OK?</i>

44:08.564 --> 44:09.439
<i>I just</i>

44:09.481 --> 44:11.608
I needed to call you and say goodbye.

44:12.442 --> 44:13.652
And I wanted to thank you.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.155
- What do you mean you're gonna disappear?
<i>- You've been a great friend, Marius</i>

44:16.446 --> 44:18.198
the best that I've ever had.

44:18.240 --> 44:21.118
- Well, then let me at least come say goodbye.
- You're like a brother to me.

44:22.202 --> 44:23.871
I hope all your dreams come true.

44:23.912 --> 44:25.747
Wait no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

44:25.789 --> 44:26.665
Fuck!

44:26.790 --> 44:27.708
Fuck.

44:33.839 --> 44:35.841
<i>Your call has been
forwarded to an aut--</i>

44:49.313 --> 44:50.189
Hello?

44:54.818 --> 44:55.694
Grandpa?

45:01.325 --> 45:02.201
Carly?

45:31.647 --> 45:32.648
I didn't find Pete.

45:32.689 --> 45:34.775
I did. Uh, he didn't go to Sedona.

45:34.816 --> 45:38.153
He's at some Indian casino with his mother
but I'm not gonna be able to get down there

45:38.195 --> 45:40.072
- before they're gone.
<i>- And your bad guys?</i>

45:40.447 --> 45:41.823
Yeah, well, they're closing in.

45:42.616 --> 45:44.034
Fuck, Marjorie.

45:45.077 --> 45:46.453
Eleven million dollars.

45:47.996 --> 45:51.041
- I can smell it, you know. I...
- You wanna pull the ripcord?

45:51.083 --> 45:53.001
<i>Well, I don't think we
have any other choice.</i>

45:53.794 --> 45:56.421
I think, uh, you gotta, you gotta get

45:56.463 --> 45:58.173
<i>- Adam and Nicole to stand by.</i>
- Of course.

46:00.842 --> 46:02.678
- You need money?
- Yeah, in paper.

46:04.096 --> 46:05.597
Wait, hold on for one second.

46:08.058 --> 46:08.934
- Julia.
<i>- Hey.</i>

46:08.976 --> 46:10.978
I just got a strange text from Taylor.

46:11.019 --> 46:13.647
Something's going on down at the farm,
and he wants all of us there.

46:13.689 --> 46:17.150
- Something good or something bad?
<i>- I can't tell but it sounds urgent.</i>

46:17.484 --> 46:18.819
Do you have your gun?

46:19.278 --> 46:20.779
I don't think it's that kinda urgent.

46:20.821 --> 46:23.365
Yeah, but just bring it just in case,
you know, cos you never know, you know?

46:23.407 --> 46:24.324
Um, yeah. OK.

46:25.075 --> 46:26.660
<i>I'm gonna meet you down there.</i>

46:26.702 --> 46:27.577
<i>Bye.</i>

46:28.495 --> 46:30.706
Uh, that was Julia.
The family might be in danger.

46:30.747 --> 46:33.375
We gotta pull the ripcord.
I'm gonna get down there just to warn them.

46:33.458 --> 46:35.294
<i>- Stay safe.</i>
- Alright, bye.

46:39.256 --> 46:41.800
Turns out Lila had given your father
a concussion.

46:42.467 --> 46:44.553
She felt bad about it!

46:44.594 --> 46:47.472
So she took him
to the emergency room herself.

46:48.974 --> 46:50.809
Your dad was working as a process server.

46:51.310 --> 46:53.228
Before he worked for your grandpa.

46:53.353 --> 46:58.650
He was, uh... he used to track people down
and serve them with lawsuits, subpoenas.

46:58.692 --> 47:01.653
- Why was he after Mum?
- Ah, some biker was suing her.

47:02.779 --> 47:05.991
He skipped bail, she chased him down,
she broke his leg...

47:07.367 --> 47:08.744
So he was suing her!

47:09.745 --> 47:12.080
Oh, so Mum was kind of a badass?

47:12.122 --> 47:15.250
- Oh, she was a hurricane.
- Lila had no restraint.

47:15.292 --> 47:17.169
Well, your dad was the same way.

47:17.336 --> 47:20.922
He proposed to your mum
after dating her a month.

47:20.964 --> 47:22.007
- It was a week.
- Here we go.

47:22.341 --> 47:24.551
- It was a month.
- Month? It was a week.

47:24.593 --> 47:26.595
What case were they working on
the night they died?

47:30.057 --> 47:33.018
I don't, I don't remember
that they were working on a case

47:33.060 --> 47:35.729
uh, just that they got hit by some drunk.

47:36.480 --> 47:39.483
Well, so how come the police report
didn't mention the guy was drunk?

47:40.108 --> 47:40.984
Huh?

47:43.779 --> 47:46.031
- Do you know?
- Maybe the cop made a mistake.

47:47.366 --> 47:48.784
- Yeah.
- Um...

47:50.869 --> 47:51.745
Oh.

47:52.037 --> 47:55.248
It's Taylor. Says he wants me back
at the farmhouse ASAP.

47:55.290 --> 47:57.542
- I wonder what's going on?
- Oh, well, I would check it out.

47:57.584 --> 47:59.628
Oh, hello.

48:01.338 --> 48:02.297
He wants me too.

48:03.090 --> 48:04.466
I better switch to coffee.

48:05.175 --> 48:07.511
You go ahead,
tell him I'll be right behind.

48:09.012 --> 48:09.888
Uh...

48:14.017 --> 48:14.893
Thank you.

48:15.102 --> 48:15.977
See...

48:16.478 --> 48:17.354
Later.

48:39.876 --> 48:40.752
- Hey.
- Hi.

48:44.714 --> 48:46.675
- Everything OK?
- Yeah. Yeah.

48:47.467 --> 48:49.261
Just, you know, cautious.

48:50.846 --> 48:51.847
We're here!

48:57.269 --> 48:58.145
What?

49:01.940 --> 49:02.941
You wanna tell 'em?

49:04.609 --> 49:06.445
Maybe we should just let 'em find out.

49:06.987 --> 49:08.113
Is that Julia?

49:11.116 --> 49:12.284
Aunt Maggie?

49:13.827 --> 49:14.703
Oh...!

49:15.412 --> 49:17.038
Oh, my little girl!

49:22.627 --> 49:24.838
Oh, and you...

49:29.342 --> 49:30.343
Pete.

49:33.805 --> 49:34.931
My boy.

49:36.391 --> 49:37.267
Come here.
