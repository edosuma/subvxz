WEBVTT

00:04.472 --> 00:07.075
I DON'T WANT TO GET GARDENING
STUFF WITH YOU ANYMORE.

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
HONEY, YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.344
THAT OLD WHITE LADY

00:10.344 --> 00:13.013
THOUGHT WE WERE TWO LABORERS
YOU PICKED UP OFF THE STREET.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.015
YEAH, SHE EVEN OFFERED ME

00:15.015 --> 00:17.218
100 BUCKS
TO CLEAN HER GUTTERS,

00:17.218 --> 00:19.420
BUT I SAID NO!

00:19.420 --> 00:21.422
WELL, I TOOK A $20 DEPOSIT,

00:21.422 --> 00:24.625
SO YOU'LL BE THERE
TUESDAY MORNING.

00:24.625 --> 00:27.495
NO, NOT HERE.
I NEED THE SOIL BY THE POTS.

00:27.495 --> 00:29.497
(whines) NO!
PERO, LADY, IT'S TOO HOT!

00:29.497 --> 00:31.932
MY SKIN IS BURNED...
(speaks Spanish).

00:31.932 --> 00:34.468
I WANT LEMONADE.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.037
I WANT TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

00:37.037 --> 00:38.639
BUT GRANDMA'S STILL ASLEEP
ON THE COUCH.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.808
I THOUGHT WHEN GRANDMA MOVED IN,
SHE WAS GONNA GET HER OWN ROOM.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.411
SHE'S STILL ASLEEP?
IT'S AFTER 3:00.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.645
JUST TELL HER TO GET UP.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.348
WE DID,
BUT SHE DIDN'T EVEN MOVE.

00:47.348 --> 00:51.519
OH, MY GOD.
MAYBE SHE'S NOT ASLEEP.

00:51.519 --> 00:52.953
DO YOU THINK...

00:52.953 --> 00:54.955
I'LL GET THE CHAMPAGNE.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.724
GEORGE!

00:56.724 --> 00:59.360
THE KIDS.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.795
THEY CAN HAVE SOME, TOO.
GOOD FOR ALL OF US!

01:06.934 --> 01:08.102
MOM?

01:09.970 --> 01:11.872
MOM?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.974
OKAY.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.776
I JUST TOOK C.P.R.
IN P.E.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.778
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO PULL HER TONGUE OUT

01:17.778 --> 01:19.813
AND SCOOP ANY VOMIT
FROM HER AIRWAY.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.526
WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD.

01:32.526 --> 01:36.297
I'M CALLING IT--
10 AFTER 3.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.372
BENNY, WAKE UP.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.039
(Everyone sighs in relief)

01:46.039 --> 01:49.810
WHY DON'T WE JUST LET HER
SLEEP IT OFF, OKAY? LET'S GO.

01:51.412 --> 01:54.548
DUDE.
I KNOW HOW TO WAKE HER UP.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.852
PUT HER HAND IN WARM WATER?

02:01.689 --> 02:03.657
WHAT ARE YOU, 10?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.659
WE CARRY THE COUCH
DOWN THE BLOCK,

02:05.659 --> 02:09.630
PUT IT BY THE TRAIN TRACKS
AND LET AMTRAK WAKE HER ASS UP.

02:14.001 --> 02:17.471
I CAN'T BREATHE.
I CAN'T BREATHE!

02:17.471 --> 02:20.641
SHH!

02:22.243 --> 02:23.811
READY YET?

02:28.682 --> 02:30.851
COME ON, WAIT!
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

02:30.851 --> 02:35.189
SOMETHING'S TRYING TO POKE
THROUGH MY TUMMY.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.566
YOU JUST RUINED OUR COUCH!

02:45.566 --> 02:48.869
WAS THAT JOKE
WORTH $1,000 TO YOU?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.204
NO.

02:56.944 --> 02:58.879
NOW IT IS.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.887
(whirring)

03:10.123 --> 03:11.225
(turns off blow dryer)

03:11.225 --> 03:13.861
BENNY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

03:13.861 --> 03:16.163
YOU WANT SOME ASPIRIN
FOR YOUR HANGOVER?

03:16.163 --> 03:19.433
I DIDN'T DRINK LAST NIGHT.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.235
SO WHY DID YOU
SLEEP ALL DAY?

03:21.235 --> 03:23.904
WHY NOT?

03:23.904 --> 03:26.607
WELL, CAN I MAKE YOU
SOMETHING TO EAT?

03:26.607 --> 03:28.609
NO.

03:28.609 --> 03:31.912
I'M NOT QUITE READY TO DIE.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.252
BUT I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.364
SOMETHING'S WRONG
WITH YOUR MOM.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.633
SHE WASN'T HUNG OVER.
SHE JUST SLEPT ALL DAY.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.403
AND NOW SHE'S NOT EVEN HUNGRY.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.774
SO?

04:00.774 --> 04:05.078
SO I THINK IT FINALLY SUNK IN
THAT HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN

04:05.078 --> 04:07.415
AND SHE LOST EVERYTHING.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.550
I THINK SHE'S
CLINICALLY DEPRESSED.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.086
YOU KNOW, I'D SAY THAT
THAT SOUNDS SILLY,

04:13.086 --> 04:17.458
BUT YOU ARE A WEDDING PLANNER,
SO YOU MUST KNOW THESE THINGS.

04:20.828 --> 04:24.832
I KNOW WHAT DEPRESSION IS LIKE
BECAUSE I'VE GONE THROUGH IT.

04:24.832 --> 04:27.200
GET OUT. WHEN?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.370
AFTER CARMEN WAS BORN.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.771
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

04:30.771 --> 04:32.906
AFTER CARMEN WAS BORN,
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT.

04:32.906 --> 04:37.177
I BARELY SAID A WORD
FOR TWO MONTHS.

04:37.177 --> 04:39.913
OH, RIGHT.

04:39.913 --> 04:43.216
THAT WAS HARD ON US.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.752
YOU SHOULD CHECK ON HER.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.253
LOOK, ANGIE,

04:46.253 --> 04:49.757
SHE'S DOWN BECAUSE LIFE'S
KICKED THE CRAP OUT OF HER.

04:49.757 --> 04:53.293
SHE DOESN'T HAVE DEPRESSION.
THAT'S A RICH PERSON DISEASE.

04:54.962 --> 04:58.165
"TIFFANY, YOUR NANNY
SAYS YOU'RE DEPRESSED.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.934
"NOW LET'S GO OUT IN THE YARD
AND TALK ABOUT IT

05:00.934 --> 05:03.404
"ON THE FERRIS WHEEL,
SHALL WE?"

05:03.404 --> 05:06.340
JUST TALK TO HER.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.012
HEY, MA.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.483
ARE YOU CLINICALLY DEPRESSED
OR WHAT?

05:20.721 --> 05:21.989
NO.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.295
HEY,
WHERE'S THE SPORTS SECTION?

05:28.295 --> 05:30.130
OH, ERNIE TOOK IT WITH HIM.

05:30.130 --> 05:33.066
(crying)

05:36.704 --> 05:40.474
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE LIKE
RIGHT AFTER CARMEN WAS BORN!

05:42.142 --> 05:45.078
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:48.949 --> 05:52.119
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:52.119 --> 05:54.254
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:54.254 --> 05:55.789
* YEAH *

06:06.667 --> 06:10.904
HEY, MOM,
ANGIE MADE YOU SOME LUNCH.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.706
NOT HUNGRY.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.843
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, MOM?
THE TV's NOT ON.

06:17.745 --> 06:21.348
YOU WATCHING THAT GORILLA
ON THE SCREEN?

06:21.348 --> 06:24.384
'CAUSE THAT'S
JUST YOUR REFLECTION.

06:29.189 --> 06:32.392
COME ON, MOM, SNAP OUT OF IT!
I JUST INSULTED YOU!

06:32.392 --> 06:35.395
(snapping fingers)
YOU GOT NOTHIN'?

06:35.395 --> 06:37.397
YOU KNOW, I RAN OUT
OF SHAMPOO THIS MORNING.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.667
IT WAS A NEW BOTTLE.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.736
THAT'S ONE BIG HEAD!

06:44.672 --> 06:46.373
I CAN'T CONTROL MY KIDS.

06:46.373 --> 06:50.410
MY DAUGHTER'S WEARING A THONG,
AND MY SON MIGHT BE, TOO.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.179
HAVE YOU SEEN HIS HAIR?

06:54.314 --> 06:56.917
MY WIFE'S A LAZY PRINCESS.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.687
WHAT?
UH-OH.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.689
SHE'S GONNA YELL AT ME.
SHE LOOKS MAD.

07:01.689 --> 07:05.593
AND I'M GONNA TAKE IT,
BECAUSE I'M WHIPPED!

07:05.593 --> 07:07.327
CAN I TALK TO YOU
IN THE KITCHEN?

07:07.327 --> 07:10.731
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?
YOU RUN EVERYTHING AROUND HERE.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.332
I CAN'T DO NOTHING.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.902
IT'S ALMOST AS IF
I'M NEUTERED IN MY MIND.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.737
GEORGE!

07:16.737 --> 07:19.840
MAN, SHE'S REALLY OUT OF IT.
I'VE NEVER SEEN HER LIKE THIS.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.209
I WENT ONLINE AND LOOKED UP
CLINICAL DEPRESSION.

07:22.209 --> 07:26.880
COME HERE. SCROLL DOWN.
YOUR MOM HAS ALL THE SYMPTOMS.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.617
"GIANT LIMBS AND SCROTUM"?

07:32.920 --> 07:37.390
NO, YOU WENT TOO FAR.
THAT'S ELEPHANTITIS.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.760
SCROLL BACK UP, PLEASE.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.962
AND HOW DOES THAT GUY
BUY UNDERWEAR?

07:41.962 --> 07:43.764
GEORGE!

07:43.764 --> 07:47.367
THIS IS SERIOUS. YOUR MOM
NEEDS PROFESSIONAL HELP.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.870
MY MOM'S NOT GONNA
SEE A SHRINK.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.739
SHE'LL SNAP OUT
OF THIS ON HER OWN.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.874
UNTIL THEN I THINK WE SHOULD
JUST ENJOY THE QUIET

07:53.874 --> 07:57.645
AND TREAT HER LIKE
A THROW PILLOW THAT CRIES.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.348
HEY, JACK, COME ON IN.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.817
HEY, GEORGE. HEY, ANGIE.
GEE, I HOPE I'M NOT INTRUDING,

08:03.817 --> 08:06.353
BUT I--WELL, I JUST WANTED
TO SEE YOUR MOM.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.955
OH, THAT'S SO SWEET OF YOU.

08:07.955 --> 08:11.024
YEAH, THE RUMOR MILL AT WORK
SAYS SHE'S GONE CRAZY.

08:12.926 --> 08:16.564
SAYS SHE'S YELLING AT LAMPS
AND EATING OUT OF GARBAGE CANS.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.934
I KINDA WANTED TO SEE THAT.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.936
SHE'S JUST A LITTLE DOWN,
THAT'S ALL.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.338
YOU KNOW HOW RUMORS
CAN GET OUT OF CONTROL.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.941
SO WHERE IS YOUR MOM?

08:27.941 --> 08:30.043
SHE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.615
MOM?

08:34.615 --> 08:37.050
JACK'S HERE.

08:44.592 --> 08:46.860
YOU KNOW, GEORGE.
THIS IS SAD/CRAZY.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.530
I WAS HOPING FOR FUNNY/CRAZY.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.107
HOW IS SHE?

09:00.107 --> 09:01.909
THE SAME.

09:01.909 --> 09:03.977
LOOK, GEORGE,
WE ALL LOVE YOUR MOM,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.914
BUT SHE'S MISSED TWO WEEKS
OF WORK ALREADY.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.916
SHE'S USED UP ALL
OF HER PERSONAL DAYS,

09:08.916 --> 09:10.283
ALL OF HER VACATION DAYS.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.720
MEL AND I HAVE BEEN
VERY GENEROUS SO FAR.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.922
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, JACK?

09:14.922 --> 09:16.757
I GOT A COMPANY TO RUN.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.592
SOMEBODY'S GOT
TO INSPECT THE PARTS.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.594
SO IF SHE'S NOT
BACK IN BY MONDAY,

09:20.594 --> 09:22.830
I'M GONNA HAVE TO REPLACE HER.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.532
YOU CAN'T FIRE HER
WITHOUT A WRITTEN WARNING.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.534
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

09:27.534 --> 09:30.904
CHECK THE CARD
IN THE FLOWERS.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.276
BENNY'S ALREADY DEPRESSED.

09:36.276 --> 09:39.512
IF SHE LOSES HER JOB,
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO HER?

09:39.512 --> 09:41.148
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S
GONNA HAPPEN--

09:41.148 --> 09:42.650
SHE'LL NEVER LEAVE.

09:42.650 --> 09:45.919
SHE'LL SLEEP ON THAT COUCH
TILL SHE DIES.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.055
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HOPE, ANGIE.

09:48.055 --> 09:51.591
YOU THINK
SHE'S THAT FAR GONE?
I'M TALKING ABOUT ME.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.863
I GOTTA GET HER BACK
TO WORK ON MONDAY.

09:55.863 --> 09:57.898
IF SHE'S NOT GONNA
SEE A THERAPIST,

09:57.898 --> 09:59.900
THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S GONNA BE IN SHAPE

09:59.900 --> 10:02.035
TO GO BACK TO WORK
IN TWO DAYS.

10:02.035 --> 10:05.438
SO WE'LL FIX HER OURSELVES,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT LOPEZES DO.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.708
WATCH THAT.
WE HEAL OUR OWN.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.442
REMEMBER WHEN MY AUNT DIED?

10:09.442 --> 10:12.379
MY UNCLE OSCAR WAS SO DEPRESSED
HE WOULDN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.782
WE WENT OVER THERE,
THREW HIM A PARTY,

10:14.782 --> 10:16.684
CHEERED HIM RIGHT UP.

10:16.684 --> 10:20.187
HE'S A HOMELESS ALCOHOLIC NOW.

10:20.187 --> 10:23.056
YEAH, BUT HE'S OUT
OF THE HOUSE.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.226
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE HE IS.
THAT'S HOW GOOD HE'S DOING.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.333
HEY, MOM.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.169
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH TOUGH TIMES,

10:36.169 --> 10:38.005
IT HELPS TO BE
AROUND LOVED ONES,

10:38.005 --> 10:41.875
AND ERNIE AND I BUMPED INTO SOME
OF YOURS AT THE LIQUOR STORE.

10:47.180 --> 10:50.984
JACK.... JIM...

10:50.984 --> 10:53.053
JOHNNY.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.822
THE CAPTAIN.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.990
(imitating pirate) ARR!

10:56.990 --> 11:00.227
METHINKS SHE'LL BE
CHEERED UP NOW! RRR!

11:02.830 --> 11:05.232
I DON'T FEEL LIKE DRINKING.

11:05.232 --> 11:09.569
OH! SHIVER ME TIMBERS!

11:09.569 --> 11:12.239
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.208
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE QUITTIN', THEN.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.912
KIDS, ARE YOU READY YET?

11:18.912 --> 11:24.217
BENNY, THE KIDS PUT TOGETHER
A SHOW FOR YOU.

11:24.217 --> 11:27.120
GRANDMA, WE KNOW THAT
YOU THINK THIS IS A BAD TIME.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.123
BUT WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT
YOU CAN OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE

11:30.123 --> 11:31.959
BECAUSE YOU'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.462
SO SIT BACK AND ENJOY

11:35.462 --> 11:39.366
"BENNY LOPEZ--
AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY."

11:43.203 --> 11:46.373
WHERE'S THAT STUPID PIRATE
WITH THE BOOZE.

11:51.178 --> 11:56.149
PEOPLE SAY YOU WERE
ABUSED AS A CHILD.

11:56.149 --> 12:00.487
(imitating little girl)
SORRY I'M LATE, DAD!

12:00.487 --> 12:02.422
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH!

12:12.432 --> 12:16.336
BUT YOU DIDN'T GIVE UP.
YOU SURVIVED.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.639
YOU GOT PREGNANT AT 16
AND DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

12:19.639 --> 12:22.776
(grunting)

12:24.344 --> 12:27.280
(gasping)

12:34.354 --> 12:38.926
MANNY, LOOK AT THE HEAD
ON OUR KID!

12:41.494 --> 12:43.997
MANNY?

12:43.997 --> 12:46.066
BUT HE WAS GONE.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.369
YOUR HUSBAND RAN AWAY
AND BECAME A MILLIONAIRE.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.341
I DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.847
WELL, HOW MUCH MORE IS THERE?

12:59.847 --> 13:01.314
THERE'S THE DAUGHTER
SHE GAVE AWAY

13:01.314 --> 13:03.283
AND THE TIME
SHE GOT GONORRHEA.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.953
WELL, KIDS,
YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB.

13:05.953 --> 13:09.122
THANK YOU SO--
THANK YOU, KIDS.

13:13.961 --> 13:17.397
ANYBODY ELSE WANT TO PILE ON?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.933
MOM, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO CHEER YOU UP.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.935
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU AND ANGIE
SHOULD GO OUT

13:21.935 --> 13:24.104
FOR THAT DAY OF BEAUTY
YOU KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.939
WE JUST GOT BACK.

13:29.242 --> 13:34.314
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.
LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE GLOWING!

13:36.283 --> 13:38.618
MOM, JACK CAME BY AND SAID
THAT IF YOU DON'T GO

13:38.618 --> 13:40.888
TO WORK ON MONDAY,
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE YOUR JOB.

13:40.888 --> 13:44.757
I ALREADY LOST MY HOUSE,
MY CAR,

13:44.757 --> 13:48.395
MY LIFE'S SAVINGS, MY DOG.

13:48.395 --> 13:51.865
YOU THINK I CARE
IF I LOSE MY JOB?

13:55.302 --> 13:58.972
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
SHE DOESN'T HAVE A DOG.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.774
SHE'S PROBABLY
TALKING ABOUT McCLOUD.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.410
WHO'S McCLOUD?

14:03.410 --> 14:05.412
OH, HE'S A STRAY
YOUR MOM TOOK IN.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.414
MY DAD SAW HER
FEEDING IT TABLE SCRAPS.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.416
THAT DOG'S PROBABLY
THE CLOSET THING

14:09.416 --> 14:11.551
SHE EVER CAME
TO LOVING SOMETHING.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.823
OH, I'M SORRY, DUDE.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.393
I HOPE HE DIDN'T DIE
IN THE FIRE.

14:20.393 --> 14:23.263
NO, I SAW HIM IN THE ALLEY
JUST THE OTHER DAY.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.532
HE PROBABLY RAN AWAY
WHEN HER HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.501
IF SOMETHING SHE CARED ABOUT
SURVIVED THE FIRE,

14:28.501 --> 14:31.004
THAT MAY BE JUST
THE THING SHE NEEDS

14:31.004 --> 14:33.073
TO PULL HER OUT
OF HER DEPRESSION.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.976
THAT'S IT.
I GOTTA FIND McCLOUD.

14:35.976 --> 14:38.011
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:38.011 --> 14:41.314
STATISTICALLY, PEOPLE
WHO HAVE PETS LIVE LONGER.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.522
I THINK I STILL HAVE
TO FIND THE DOG, HUH?

14:56.129 --> 14:58.698
(George) McCLOUD?

14:58.698 --> 15:01.334
McCLOUD?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.870
I KNOW I SAW HIM AROUND HERE.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.505
WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HOURS.

15:05.505 --> 15:09.209
WHOA, HEY, THERE HE IS.
THAT'S McCLOUD.

15:09.209 --> 15:11.011
I'LL DISTRACT HIM
WITH THE BOLOGNA

15:11.011 --> 15:12.379
WHILE YOU GET HIM
ON THE LEASH.

15:12.379 --> 15:15.348
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT WAS THE PLAN?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.884
I'M TELLIN' YOU NOW.
GIVE ME THE BOLOGNA.

15:17.884 --> 15:19.953
NO.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.089
ERNIE,
WHERE'S THE BOLOGNA?

15:22.089 --> 15:24.958
INSIDE ME.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.960
WHY THE HELL DID YOU EAT IT?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.462
WHAT DID YOU THINK
THE BOLOGNA WAS FOR?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.298
FOR COMING WITH YOU.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.300
ALL RIGHT.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.368
JUST KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR ME.

15:35.368 --> 15:38.138
I'LL GET THE LEASH ON HIM.
McCLOUD.

15:38.138 --> 15:42.542
HEY, BOY! ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST GET HIM AND GO.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.277
COME ON, BOY.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.280
(loud engine rumbling)

15:53.620 --> 15:56.023
(coughs)

15:59.559 --> 16:01.761
(motorcycle turns off)
DON'T PANIC.

16:01.761 --> 16:03.463
DON'T PANIC.

16:04.731 --> 16:08.435
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING WITH MY DOG?

16:08.435 --> 16:11.438
Â¿QUÃ©? NO HABLO INGLÃ©S.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.540
YOU! WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

16:13.540 --> 16:18.378
I'M ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA,
THE NEW MAYOR.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.447
I'VE DECIDED
TO MEET MY CONSTITUENTS,

16:20.447 --> 16:22.282
BECAUSE I BELIEVE TOGETHER

16:22.282 --> 16:24.717
WE CAN MAKE THIS
A BETTER LOS ANGELES.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.089
COME ON, PHILIPPE. WE HAVE
A PHOTO OP IN KOREATOWN.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.158
WHO ARE YOU?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.659
GEORGE LOPEZ.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.727
MY MOM'S THE ONE WHOSE
HOUSE BURNED DOWN.

16:34.727 --> 16:38.798
SO YOU'RE THE LOSER SON
SHE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING ABOUT.

16:38.798 --> 16:41.268
SHE TALKS ABOUT ME.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.937
LOOK, HERE'S THE THING--
THIS WAS HER DOG.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.740
SHE'S REALLY DEPRESSED,
AND IF I TAKE IT BACK TO HER,

16:47.740 --> 16:49.109
IT'LL CHEER HER UP.

16:49.109 --> 16:50.477
I GET IT.

16:50.477 --> 16:53.680
MY MOM WAS REAL DEPRESSED
WHEN SHE STABBED MY DAD,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.748
AND HE JUST WOULDN'T DIE.

16:57.450 --> 17:00.687
OH, THANKS, MAN.
I'M GLAD YOU GET THIS.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.822
GIVE ME $500 FOR THE DOG.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.325
I'LL GIVE YOU $100.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.327
HEY, THIS IS ABOUT
YOUR MOM'S HAPPINESS.

17:07.327 --> 17:09.896
THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH
THAT'S WORTH TO YOU.
$40.

17:09.896 --> 17:11.331
HOW ABOUT $200,

17:11.331 --> 17:14.000
AND I LET YOU WALK OUT
OF THE YARD WITH YOUR TEETH?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.003
OH, IT'S LIKE THAT?

17:17.003 --> 17:18.471
DEAL.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.847
DID YOU FIND HER DOG?

17:27.847 --> 17:31.050
YUP, AND WE GOT HIM TIED UP
IN THE LIVING ROOM RIGHT NOW.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.719
OH!
HEY, MOM.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.188
GOT A FURRY LITTLE FRIEND
IN THERE

17:35.188 --> 17:37.257
THAT'S GONNA CHEER YOU UP.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.758
HOW IS THE GREEK GUY

17:38.758 --> 17:42.429
FROM THE GAS STATION
GONNA CHEER ME UP?

17:43.996 --> 17:45.465
NO.
WE FOUND McCLOUD!

17:45.465 --> 17:48.701
DON'T MESS WITH ME.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.036
I'M SERIOUS.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.539
WE FOUND HIM AT A BIKER'S HOUSE
DOWN THE STREET.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.742
McCLOUD'S ALIVE?
AND HE'S IN THE LIVING ROOM
RIGHT NOW.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.178
OH! OOH.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.046
YOU BROUGHT THAT DOG INSIDE?

18:00.046 --> 18:01.548
YEAH, WE TIED HIM
TO THE BANISTER.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.416
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ISN'T HE HOUSE-TRAINED?

18:03.416 --> 18:08.087
HE GETS A LITTLE SQUIRRELLY
WHEN HE'S COOPED UP.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.590
(growling)

18:16.663 --> 18:18.731
(gasps)

18:18.731 --> 18:20.733
(gasps)

18:20.733 --> 18:21.934
THE BANISTER LOOKS OKAY.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.936
MY COUCH!

18:23.936 --> 18:26.339
OH--LAMPS, THE PILLOWS--

18:26.339 --> 18:27.874
GEORGE, DO SOMETHING!

18:27.874 --> 18:30.343
WHAT, FEED HIM MY LEG?
LET HIM FILL UP ON THE PILLOW.

18:32.044 --> 18:34.113
SHOW HIM
WHO THE ALPHA DOG IS.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.616
ALL RIGHT. McCLOUD!

18:38.285 --> 18:40.787
BAD DOG! BAD!

18:40.787 --> 18:43.590
(all screaming)

18:43.590 --> 18:46.926
YOU'VE GOT TOO MANY STAIRS!

18:46.926 --> 18:49.462
SHUT THE DOOR!
WAIT!

18:51.531 --> 18:52.665
(barks)

18:52.665 --> 18:54.033
GOD, THAT WAS CLOSE.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.703
WAIT, WHERE'S BENNY?
WHO CARES?

18:56.703 --> 18:58.638
(barking)

19:00.072 --> 19:02.742
(laughing) OH...

19:02.742 --> 19:05.245
THAT'S OKAY, BOY.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.613
HERE. COME ON.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.482
MOMMY THOUGHT
THE COUCH WAS UGLY, TOO.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.455
(laughing) DAMN!

19:15.455 --> 19:20.126
IT DOESN'T GET
ANY BETTER THAN THAT.

19:20.126 --> 19:22.829
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU SO SCARED

19:22.829 --> 19:25.632
SINCE THAT HALLOWEEN,
YOU KNOW, WHEN I CHASED YOU

19:25.632 --> 19:28.968
AROUND THE HOUSE
WITH A KNIFE.

19:28.968 --> 19:33.340
WELL, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN FUNNY
ON HALLOWEEN, BUT IT WAS EASTER.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.544
BENNY, THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.679
NO, IT'S NOT FUNNY TO YOU.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.250
AND THAT MAKES IT
FUNNIER TO ME!

19:44.617 --> 19:47.186
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE DRINKING A BEER.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.756
YOU'RE LAUGHING
AT PEOPLE'S MISERY.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.190
MOM, YOU'RE BACK!

19:51.190 --> 19:52.825
NO, I'M NOT BACK.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.527
I JUST GOT A GOOD LAUGH

19:54.527 --> 19:57.330
OUT OF YOU RUNNING
OUT OF THERE LIKE A WUSS.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.535
YOU KNOW, I'M GLAD YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO WORK ON MONDAY.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.103
I DON'T NEED ALL MY EMPLOYEES

20:04.103 --> 20:07.307
HEARING ABOUT HOW I GOT CHASED
OUT OF MY HOUSE BY A DOG.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.875
YOU KNOW,
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GONE,

20:08.875 --> 20:11.210
I'VE BEEN GETTING SOME RESPECT
AROUND THERE.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.112
WELL, THAT ENDS TOMORROW.

20:13.112 --> 20:15.382
BECAUSE I'M GONNA GO
BACK TO WORK,

20:15.382 --> 20:19.719
AND I'M GONNA TELL EVERYBODY
HOW MY LITTLE GIRL...

20:19.719 --> 20:21.921
WENT RUNNING OUT OF THE HOUSE

20:21.921 --> 20:24.857
'CAUSE SHE WAS BEING CHASED
BY A TEACUP POODLE.

20:26.726 --> 20:29.061
THAT DOG'S
A 100-POUND KILLER!

20:29.061 --> 20:31.698
NOT IN MY STORY.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.408
IT'S YOU!

20:41.408 --> 20:42.809
THAT'S RIGHT.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.611
I'M ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA,
THE NEW MAYOR.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.646
I'M TRYING TO MEET
ALL MY CONSTITUENTS,

20:46.646 --> 20:47.947
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT TOGETHER,

20:47.947 --> 20:50.917
WE CAN MAKE THIS
A BETTER LOS ANGELES.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.420
WOW, YOU REALLY DO THAT!

20:53.420 --> 20:55.588
NO, BUT I HEARD
YOU WERE IMPERSONATING ME,

20:55.588 --> 20:59.426
AND KNOCK IT OFF, OR WE WON'T
PICK UP YOUR TRASH AGAIN.

21:02.028 --> 21:05.598
OH. HEY, MAYOR, BEFORE YOU GO,
LET ME ASK YOU--

21:05.598 --> 21:07.567
HOW TOUGH WOULD IT BE

21:07.567 --> 21:09.569
TO DECLARE, LIKE,
GEORGE LOPEZ DAY?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.571
I DON'T NEED MUCH--
LIKE A STATUE IN THE PARK

21:11.571 --> 21:12.672
LIKE THAT--"HELLO."

21:12.672 --> 21:14.674
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.676
WHY DON'T WE CONCENTRATE
ON FIXING OUR SCHOOLS

21:16.676 --> 21:18.911
AND MAKING OUR STREETS
SAFER FOR ALL OF US?

21:18.911 --> 21:23.883
I CAN NEVER DO NOTHING
IN MY HOUSE!
