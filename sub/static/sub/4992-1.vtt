00:05.047 --> 00:07.675
Everyone nice and civil.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.435
Thank you.
And roll sound, please.

00:10.719 --> 00:14.189
- Ready?
- One, take one.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.398
- That's beautiful.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.784
- Two, two, two, two, two.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.867
Good day, gentlemen.
How are you, man?

00:31.281 --> 00:34.205
- Yeah, I mean, We'll just...
See how long it takes her...

00:34.493 --> 00:37.246
Just asking her questions
and seeing where it ends up.

00:37.538 --> 00:38.664
- Yeah.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.175
- Where do you want me?

00:41.458 --> 00:43.836
- Angie. Hi. Uh, welcome.

00:44.127 --> 00:46.380
Look, just... Over there.
Thank you.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.475
All right, folks.
Let's lock it down.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.853
Keep it quiet.

00:53.136 --> 00:55.184
- Here?
- Yep, that's fine.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.692
And feel free to move around
in the space.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.695
All right, look, um.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.279
We're already rolling,
so, um... You ready?

01:05.566 --> 01:08.285
- Yep.
- Okay. Great.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.162
And...

01:10.445 --> 01:12.994
And action.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.371
Like... like I said,

01:19.663 --> 01:21.961
why don't you start
by introducing yourself.

01:22.249 --> 01:24.092
Now? All right.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.425
I'm Angie, and I'm a sex worker.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.717
Is that okay?
Do you want more than that?

01:32.009 --> 01:33.727
- Um, where do you work?

01:34.011 --> 01:36.730
- Potts point,
near the post office.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.358
- Okay,
and... and how old are you?

01:39.641 --> 01:40.984
- Depends.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.896
How come
you're all the way back there?

01:44.187 --> 01:47.908
- Oh, it just..Works better
for the lights and the cameras.

01:48.191 --> 01:49.784
- Okay. Do you mind If I smoke?

01:50.068 --> 01:52.196
- Um, actually,
I'd prefer If you didn't.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.659
- Why?

01:53.947 --> 01:55.324
- Uh, it just doesn't look
very good on camera.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.618
- Well, it used to
in the... Old movies.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.911
They always did it
before a sex scene.

02:00.203 --> 02:01.295
Can I ask you a question?

02:01.580 --> 02:03.100
If I make a mistake,
can I do it again?

02:03.206 --> 02:04.253
- No.
- Why?

02:04.541 --> 02:06.543
- Because It's an interview.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.235
- Yeah,
but don't you normally take,

02:08.419 --> 02:09.940
like, all the different bits
and pieces

02:10.172 --> 02:11.572
and put them together later
anyway'?

02:11.757 --> 02:13.637
- True, but I would like
to do this in one take.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.960
- 'Cause It's cheaper?
- Uh, It's kind of an experiment.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.306
- And you've got enough film
to do it all in one go?

02:18.597 --> 02:19.598
- No, We'll have to...

02:19.890 --> 02:21.211
- do I have to stick
to the topic?

02:21.224 --> 02:22.441
Can I talk about anything?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.148
You don't think
It's gonna get a bit boring?

02:24.436 --> 02:27.815
It's about sex. It'll be fine.

02:28.106 --> 02:30.985
- What sort of people
are gonna watch this movie?

02:31.276 --> 02:33.654
All I can see
is a guy in a raincoat.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.538
Hi.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.746
- Well, he's certainly
not the target audience.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.502
- Then who ls?

02:40.786 --> 02:42.504
- Oh, people like me, I guess.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.629
- You'd... Make more money
from porn, you know.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.668
- Well that's not
what I want to do.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.090
- Make money?
- Make porn.

02:49.378 --> 02:52.052
- You know... Mr. Raincoats
gonna feel pretty ripped off.

02:52.339 --> 02:53.841
If It's all talk and no action.

02:54.132 --> 02:56.510
What If I did a little strip
for him... would that be okay?

02:56.802 --> 02:59.681
- Depend on the context.
- Context'?

02:59.971 --> 03:02.565
Sex is sex, babe.
It doesn't need a context.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.317
- Okay. Forget that.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.854
- Why are there so many cameras?
- Why so many questions?

03:07.145 --> 03:08.271
- It's all new to me.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.156
- Well, you could have asked them
before we began.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.113
- How much
do these sex films cost?

03:12.401 --> 03:14.654
- It's not a sex film.
- Would I get paid extra?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.242
- For what?
- For stripping.

03:16.530 --> 03:17.656
Double my fee, I'll do it.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.825
I don't have the budget.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.711
- Really? Well, these cameras
look pretty expensive.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.747
I bet you didn't get those
from a garage sale, did ya?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.087
How 'bout $500, then?
<i>- I</i> don't...

03:28.375 --> 03:29.843
- What, yes, no?
I'm not worth it?

03:30.127 --> 03:32.221
- Hey, I didn't say that.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.848
Will you tell me... How much?

03:35.132 --> 03:37.134
$300? $250? $200?

03:37.426 --> 03:38.769
- Okay. Come on.
- $200?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.850
Is that a $200'?

03:44.599 --> 03:47.819
You're a bit of a cheap Charlie,
aren't ya?

03:48.103 --> 03:50.322
I'll take my top off for that.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.573
Could you get someone
to turn up the heater?

03:58.864 --> 04:00.286
So, what do you think?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.622
- It doesn't matter what I think.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.037
- What sort of an answers that?

04:05.328 --> 04:08.878
I'm showing them off for you.
- Hey, not for me.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.760
- Well,
for you, for them, whoever.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.465
Don't be an asshole.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.132
Okay. They're very nice.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.053
- Is this camera on?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.721
- They're all on.

04:23.013 --> 04:26.893
So, what do you want to do now?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.864
- Can we get back
to the interview, please?

04:28.894 --> 04:30.066
- Sorry.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.616
My name's... Norma.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.743
And my name's Jean.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.904
We're gonna be in a movie. Wow!

04:39.196 --> 04:42.746
All those boys looking at us.
Hello, boys.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.501
Hi, Mr. raincoat.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.710
What do you think
of the director?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.841
Ooh, he's kind of cute.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.843
He's staring at you.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.846
No, not at me... at you, Jean.

04:57.130 --> 05:01.010
Is he? I wonder
If he's getting a hard-on.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.770
You are. I'm just cold.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.603
Ooh! Oooh!

05:06.890 --> 05:08.733
Hmm?

05:09.017 --> 05:10.985
- So?
- So, what?

05:11.269 --> 05:14.944
- You don't have anything to say?

05:15.232 --> 05:19.157
- No, not really.
- Anyone?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.117
Guess we've done breasts.
What's next?

05:21.404 --> 05:23.202
- I'd just like you
to answer my questions.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.868
- Well, why don't you
fucking ask some?

05:28.954 --> 05:31.127
- Okay.

05:31.414 --> 05:35.214
What does sex mean to you?

05:35.502 --> 05:39.973
Um... What does sex mean to me?

05:40.257 --> 05:43.557
Multiplication and division.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.597
- Sorry?
- It's my answer.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.890
Multiplication and division.
- I don't get it.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.435
- Well, If you prefer,
I could talk about my pussy.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.399
- Actually, I'd rather you
just explain what you mean.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.888
- Why don't we start on
the surface and work our way in?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.547
- You mean...
Figuratively speaking.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.783
- Do I?

05:59.067 --> 06:02.162
Do I? I don't think so.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.742
I think I mean,

06:04.030 --> 06:06.533
let's start with cunts and cocks
and see where we end up.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.202
See that?

06:08.493 --> 06:11.337
Isn't that just one perfect ass
for a good spanking?

06:11.621 --> 06:12.588
Go on.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.341
Gimme some sugar.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.127
And I'll answer
all your prayers.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.888
Oh, for fuck's sake...

06:20.171 --> 06:24.017
could you just, like, try
to work with me a little bit?

06:24.301 --> 06:26.019
Oh, you...
you don't get it, do you?

06:26.303 --> 06:28.584
If you want me to get into this,
then you're gonna have to

06:28.805 --> 06:30.182
- give a little bit.
- I am.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.225
- I thought I asked for someone
to turn up the heater.

06:32.517 --> 06:33.484
- Yeah, It's happening.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.191
- Still cold in here.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.447
- Well, It's a big space.
- Aw, no shit.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.826
You're the intellectual type,
aren't you?

06:41.109 --> 06:42.235
I know your kind.

06:42.527 --> 06:44.370
You have to think
about everything,

06:44.654 --> 06:46.327
- rationalize everything.
- Yeah.

06:46.615 --> 06:47.832
- Look, If you don't
lighten up a little bit,

06:48.116 --> 06:50.494
not much is gonna happen here,
yeah?

06:50.785 --> 06:52.162
- You with me?
- I think so.

06:52.454 --> 06:53.671
- I think so.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.377
I don't think so.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.705
Geez,
you're so fucking monosyllabic.

06:57.709 --> 06:58.881
- Ah, that's a big word.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.171
- Yeah, I've got
a lot of big words, honey.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.966
I bet you're really dirty,
aren't you?

07:05.592 --> 07:08.015
You intellectual types
are like that.

07:08.303 --> 07:12.228
You hold back, but when you
let go, you're fucking scary.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.643
Am I right?

07:17.395 --> 07:19.773
Yeah, see? There you go.
You're thinking about it.

07:20.065 --> 07:22.266
It's a simple question,
but you've got to think about it

07:22.359 --> 07:25.238
from every different angle,
like "Oh, should I say this",

07:25.528 --> 07:28.031
"or what will be
the ramifications If I say that,

07:28.323 --> 07:31.748
or this, or"... fucking just...
geez, just fucking do it!

07:32.035 --> 07:35.084
When's the last time
you said "cunt"?

07:36.498 --> 07:38.466
- I... Don't remember.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.004
- Bullshit. Say it.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.970
- Well, in what context?

07:46.257 --> 07:48.225
- Just say the word.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.179
- Cunt.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.566
- Was that so difficult?
- No.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.898
- Then say "smelly cunt."
- Ah, see that's derogatory.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.611
- It's a cunt. It smells.
They all do. Say it.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.778
- I don't see why...
- Geez, just fucking say it, man.

08:06.069 --> 08:07.412
- Do it!
- Smelly cunt.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.039
- Thank you.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.547
Would you like to do down on me?

08:17.831 --> 08:21.381
It's a yes or a no.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.794
- No.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.340
- What, not... Now?

08:26.631 --> 08:28.429
Not here'?
Not any time, anywhere?

08:28.717 --> 08:30.845
- You said it was a yes
or a no question.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.933
- You married?

08:33.221 --> 08:34.768
Is that it?

08:35.056 --> 08:36.308
Playing Mr. faithful,

08:36.599 --> 08:39.318
but It's okay to talk about sex
with other women'?

08:39.602 --> 08:41.650
- Sure.
- Why?

08:41.938 --> 08:44.862
What <i>...</i> If... If I'm...
If I'm gonna talk about myself

08:45.150 --> 08:47.403
and reveal myself to...
to you and them,

08:47.694 --> 08:49.094
then I've at least
got to trust you.

08:49.279 --> 08:50.405
- You can.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.994
- Yeah, well,
then start opening up to me.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.283
- I'm the director.
- And that's the point.

08:53.575 --> 08:54.952
You know, If... If...

08:55.243 --> 08:56.586
If we were making a film
about racing-car drivers and...

08:56.870 --> 08:58.590
and I hooned up to you
in my little red car,

08:58.830 --> 09:00.830
and I was like, "hey, get in.
We'll go for a spin."

09:00.999 --> 09:01.966
You would.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.843
Even If
you were scared shitless,

09:04.127 --> 09:06.300
you would 'cause that's
how you'd win my trust.

09:06.588 --> 09:08.908
So, sex is different, is it?
- Of course it is.

09:09.174 --> 09:13.850
- How? It's just bodies fucking.

09:14.137 --> 09:15.639
My God,
If we can't even get past

09:15.930 --> 09:17.432
the simple,
basic mechanics of it,

09:17.724 --> 09:20.273
how the fuck are we gonna move
on to anything interesting?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.483
So, what's your wife's name'?

09:25.398 --> 09:27.901
You won't even tell me
your wife's name?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.573
- Matilda.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.993
- Matilda.

09:36.284 --> 09:40.209
It's a very Australian name.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.250
Is she named after the song?
- I suppose she is.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.884
- How patriotic.
- Hmm.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.761
- Hey, matilda.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.093
What do you reckon?

09:49.380 --> 09:53.806
His tongue, my clit,
nothing emotional?

09:55.512 --> 09:58.231
I get to find out
If he's for real,

09:58.515 --> 09:59.915
and he gets to make
his little film.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.067
He any good at that?

10:01.351 --> 10:02.853
- Let's stick to the topic,
shall we?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.487
- Is he'?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.694
Sorry, I've just got to...

10:13.988 --> 10:16.411
Hello? Hey.

10:16.699 --> 10:20.374
Yep. No.
No, I can't. I'm... Busy.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.211
Um... Yeah, tomorrow. Yeah, 4:30.

10:23.498 --> 10:26.752
Yeah,
I'm looking forward to it, too.

10:27.043 --> 10:28.420
Yeah.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.759
Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.760
- Sorry.
- Was that a client?

10:35.051 --> 10:37.304
- No. My daughter.

10:37.595 --> 10:40.189
She's with her father.

10:40.473 --> 10:45.354
Cut that bit out If you want.
Now, uh...

10:45.645 --> 10:48.524
- Where were we?
- Um...

10:48.815 --> 10:50.158
Start from the beginning.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.068
Um... Tell us about yourself,
you know, what you do.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.658
- Well, aren't you gonna use
any of the stuff from before?

10:54.946 --> 10:56.869
- Yes, I am, I just think
we should start again,

10:57.157 --> 10:58.875
get things going properly
this time, okay'?

10:59.159 --> 11:02.083
- Okay. Got it.

11:02.370 --> 11:06.216
Uh... Hi. My name's Angie.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.503
I'm a scorpio
with an Ares rising.

11:09.794 --> 11:13.515
I was born in singleton,
and now I live in Sydney.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.893
I'm a sex worker.
And I work in a parlor.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.225
Single, never married.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.514
I like music,
especially hip-hop.

11:21.806 --> 11:25.151
Um, I collect spiders
and old playboy magazines.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.904
I have a science degree.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.441
- You have a science degree?

11:30.732 --> 11:33.656
Organic chemistry.

11:33.943 --> 11:36.571
- What,
a hooker can't be educated?

11:36.863 --> 11:38.615
- You don't sound like someone
with a science degree.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.409
- Well, you don't sound like
a movie director.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.418
What, I'm supposed to be
some kind of...

11:42.702 --> 11:44.670
Junkie with 10 kids
and no way to support them?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.877
- It happens.
- Yeah, it does, but It's not me.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.565
But you're part of it.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.005
- What... what about sex slavery?
- What about it?

11:50.293 --> 11:51.414
- Well, do you condone that?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.723
- Do you?
- Of course not.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.634
- Then why would I?

11:57.926 --> 12:00.270
Jesus fucking...

12:00.553 --> 12:03.898
Forced prostitution, pimps,
and trafficking are wrong, okay?

12:04.182 --> 12:06.731
They're illegal
and they're wrong... You know?

12:07.018 --> 12:09.646
But It's... It's not
the whole story, you know.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.066
It's like...
It's like in the movies.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.405
How many hookers
have a happy ending?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.740
They always get killed off
in some...

12:17.028 --> 12:19.622
Dark alley or cheap motel.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.658
It's what they deserve,
you know?

12:21.950 --> 12:23.327
That's the fucking PR.

12:23.618 --> 12:25.962
The... it...
We've gotten a really bad rap,

12:26.246 --> 12:29.671
but some of us actually plan to
grow old and have grandchildren.

12:31.167 --> 12:33.090
- Okay.
- Yeah.

12:33.378 --> 12:35.426
Okay.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.761
- So,
how did you first get into it?

12:38.049 --> 12:39.847
- My legs wide open.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.602
- It was a serious question.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.184
- Ooh,
I like it when you get serious.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.146
- Come on, Angie.
- Oh, I know.

12:47.433 --> 12:49.856
Look, I was at uni.
I needed a job.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.818
I rang up a parlor
and got an interview.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.484
- Why not some other job?
- The money.

12:55.775 --> 12:59.780
Someone said I was sitting on a
gold mine... May as well use it.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.574
- And that's w?
- Yep.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.345
- It's not that simple, though,
is it?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.007
I mean, It's not like
working in the shop.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.795
Why, 'cause I get to lie around
all day?

13:11.082 --> 13:13.505
No warranties, no guarantees.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.545
No returns.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.182
Other than that,
It's pretty much the same.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.308
Except I'm the merchandise.
- Exactly.

13:21.592 --> 13:22.639
- Exactly, what?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.407
- Well, you're selling yourself.
- So?

13:24.554 --> 13:26.227
- Well, that's a part of yourself
you're giving away.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.481
- No, no.
Not giving away, selling.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.086
- What about your emotional self?

13:29.100 --> 13:31.228
Oh, my emotional self!

13:31.519 --> 13:33.442
I'm not selling
my emotional self.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.697
I'm selling a commodity.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.302
- Yeah,
but that commodity is you.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.609
- Yes, and your point being?

13:37.900 --> 13:39.368
- It's intimately you.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.893
- And If you're an accountant,
you're selling your brain.

13:41.904 --> 13:44.908
Shit, how intimate is that?
It's simple. It's a job.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.667
J-o-b. Job.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.552
And the sooner everyone
figures that out,

13:48.786 --> 13:50.208
the sooner We'll get proper
occupational health and safety.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.097
You know,
everything else we should have.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.175
Family courts
still take our children away!

13:54.459 --> 13:56.837
We're not aliens, you know,
If you prick us we do bleed.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.568
- So you dismiss sex as being
no different than anything else?

13:59.797 --> 14:01.049
- I don't dismiss it at all!

14:01.341 --> 14:03.389
It's... It's an incredibly
powerful instrument,

14:03.676 --> 14:05.770
but... but It's not some divine,
godlike thing...

14:06.054 --> 14:08.477
not on It's own... and that's
not a moral thing, either.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.733
- No moral dimension?
- No, absolutely not.

14:11.017 --> 14:12.690
- I don't believe
you can say that!

14:12.977 --> 14:15.605
- If you make a cup of tea,
that has no moral dimension.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.194
If someone puts arsenic in it,
then it does.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.779
- Come on, that's not
a reasonable comparison.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.628
- Why not?
- Because tea isn't intimate!

14:20.902 --> 14:22.324
It's not even personal.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.410
A body is just a body.
A word is just a word.

14:24.697 --> 14:25.664
"Fuck" is not moral.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.245
"Fuck you" might be.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.752
It's the intent
that is the morality.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.413
Sex in itself is just sex.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.581
It's in, out, in, out,
in, out, in, out.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.295
It's not fucking brain surgery.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.983
- But you're doing it
for the money.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.608
That is the intent.
- Oh, is that it?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.638
It's the money! What about you?

14:40.922 --> 14:43.721
You're making this film,
and It's about sex.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.260
You want to get paid.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.848
And them... they're watching it.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.683
And they're paying to watch it.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.724
I think we're all
in this together, don't you?

14:52.016 --> 14:54.360
I liked sex
before I was a sex worker,

14:54.644 --> 14:57.614
and most of the time,
I like sex as a sex worker.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.240
I love what I do!

14:59.524 --> 15:00.992
Love what I do.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.323
I love what I do.
- Do you really?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.830
- Yeah.
Something wrong with that?

15:08.491 --> 15:09.993
Oh, you don't believe me.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.163
- Well, you must get
some pretty strange types.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.580
- Yeah, I get people like you,
actually.

15:14.872 --> 15:15.873
- You know what I mean.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.712
- I've probably
fucked your father.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.673
- Well, that's unlikely.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.134
- He's in a wheelchair.
- So?

15:22.422 --> 15:25.096
- What was it like
the first time you did it?

15:25.383 --> 15:28.808
- You mean for money, as opposed
to flowers and chocolates?

15:29.095 --> 15:30.267
- Yeah. Were you nervous?

15:30.555 --> 15:32.523
- Yeah, but not
for the reason you think.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.684
I was nervous
because up until then,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.570
I'd been an amateur,
and now I was a professional...

15:37.854 --> 15:39.606
a pro...
and there's a difference.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.899
There's expectations,
responsibilities.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.535
You got to deliver...
do you know what I mean?

15:44.819 --> 15:45.945
- And did you?

15:46.237 --> 15:47.989
- Absolutely.
I got right into it.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.409
I bought a black wig
and I went Spanish.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.123
Management were looking
for a marketing angle.

15:53.411 --> 15:56.836
Apparently, organic chemistry
isn't a turn-on.

15:57.123 --> 16:00.593
You can't be too smart.
The mugs don't like it.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.003
So, that first time,

16:02.295 --> 16:04.764
the client asked
If I did a "passionate" service.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.266
- What's that?
- Well, that's what I asked.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.599
It means kisses and cuddles,
and I thought, "that's okay."

16:10.887 --> 16:12.184
I can do that."

16:12.472 --> 16:13.689
I was so naive.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.771
I thought it meant
just kisses and cuddles...

16:16.058 --> 16:17.355
well, it doesn't, of course.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.896
It means kisses, cuddles,
and full service.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.407
And when he went
to spread my legs, I said,

16:22.690 --> 16:27.287
"what are you doing?!"

16:27.570 --> 16:29.664
I didn't think
prostitutes kissed.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.290
- Oh, really?

16:31.574 --> 16:34.544
And what particular magazine
did you get that from'?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.706
We're not clones, you know.
We... Do what we want.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.250
Some do passionate,
and some do G.F.E.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.044
- G.F.E.? What... what's that?

16:43.336 --> 16:44.804
- The girlfriend experience.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.089
We pretend
to be your girlfriend.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.011
We sit around the kitchen table,
we have a cup of tea and chat,

16:51.302 --> 16:53.521
we wash the dishes,
we watch some TV,

16:53.804 --> 16:55.272
then we go to bed and fuck.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.809
It's not for the fainthearted.
- Right.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.819
So, It's not just
all standard lovemaking, th en.

17:01.103 --> 17:06.030
- Lovemaking?
Honey, you are so adorable.

17:06.317 --> 17:07.785
I get all sorts of requests,

17:08.069 --> 17:10.321
and what they ask for
and what they want

17:10.613 --> 17:12.661
are not necessarily
the same thing.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.748
Well... well, normally,
they are, but sometimes...

17:16.035 --> 17:18.413
You've just got to...
Read between the lines...

17:18.704 --> 17:19.829
dig a bit deeper.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.762
- Like a therapist?
- I'm not a therapist.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.112
- No,
but you have to be like one.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.846
- I'm not there
to cure anybody of anything.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.450
Some of them
might be a bit weird,

17:28.714 --> 17:30.114
but there's nothing wrong
with them.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.684
If a guy comes in
and asks for sex,

17:31.968 --> 17:34.471
I've got to work out, does he
want an orgasm or company,

17:34.762 --> 17:38.812
or... Or flattery, or human
touch, or a finger up the ass?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.602
It's very confusing being a guy.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.271
You walk around
with that thing in your pants,

17:43.563 --> 17:44.655
controlling how you feel,

17:44.939 --> 17:46.459
and you don't know
what to do about it.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.575
- And what about
the consequences?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.237
- What consequences?
- Well, like diseases.

17:51.529 --> 17:53.076
- You never heard of safe sex?

17:53.364 --> 17:55.037
- Relationships, then.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.871
- Mine or theirs?
- Theirs.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.456
- Safe sex.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.746
- No, I didn't mean physical...
I meant emotional.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.290
- Oh, so did I. Safe sex.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.129
Sex with rules.
Sex with boundaries.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.634
Time limits.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.841
They come and see me
and blow out some steam

18:08.129 --> 18:10.097
and then they go home
and play happy families.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.179
It's a win-win.
The wives should love us.

18:12.466 --> 18:14.560
They don't, but they should.
- Do you get envious?

18:14.844 --> 18:17.848
- Of what?
- Of their family lives.

18:18.139 --> 18:21.689
- If family life was so good,
I'd be broke, and I'm not.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.603
I have an apartment in town

18:23.894 --> 18:26.522
and an investment property
up the coast.

18:26.814 --> 18:29.363
Business is thriving.
Families aren't.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.869
- And what about
your relationships?

18:32.153 --> 18:35.282
- Ooh, well, I've had boyfriends,
like everyone else.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.951
- And what do they think
about what you do?

18:38.242 --> 18:41.337
- Some of them are okay with it,
and some of them aren't.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.090
- And If they don't like it?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.671
- Well, If they want me,
they have to accept it.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.632
- Yeah,
but don't they get jealous?

18:48.919 --> 18:52.014
- I like them to be jealous.
Or just a bit.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.766
- That's a contradiction,
isn't it'?

18:54.050 --> 18:55.267
- If you say so.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.890
- You ever dated a client?
- Maybe.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.069
- Tell us about him.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.148
- It's a she.

19:08.439 --> 19:10.191
- A female client?
- Most "shes" are.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.076
- Uh, do you see many women?
- No.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.953
- Do you like seeing them?
- Nope.

19:14.236 --> 19:16.705
- Why?
- Women are too hard to read.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.583
A guy's got a fat dick
or he hasn't.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.369
Women aren't like that.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.958
- Tell me about her.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.748
- Nope.
- Why'?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.384
- It's personal.

19:28.668 --> 19:32.172
But I'll tell you about Arthur.
Not his real name.

19:32.463 --> 19:34.264
- Well, do they ever
tell you their real name?

19:34.382 --> 19:36.302
Probably not, but
I wouldn't know... I don't ask.

19:36.467 --> 19:40.188
It's not relevant.
- So, is Angie your real name?

19:40.471 --> 19:42.473
- What do you think, sweetie?

19:42.765 --> 19:46.065
Do you think
Angie's my real name? Do you?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.731
So, what would you like
to call me, then?

19:50.022 --> 19:51.899
I can be anyone you want.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.070
<i>I</i> could be Kylie, Lulu,
francoise.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.614
I can even be mistress Violet.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.782
But she'll cost you more.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.418
- I'm not a client.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.902
- You're paying me by the hour

20:03.953 --> 20:05.233
and I'm giving you
what you want.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.296
- Not the same.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.797
- Listen, honey.

20:08.082 --> 20:10.082
I've got hundreds of guys
who want to videotape me,

20:10.334 --> 20:12.007
so don't think
you're anything special.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.342
You've just got a bigger camera.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.600
Big lens, big camera... that's
why I'm charging you more.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.055
Take it as a compliment.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.266
- I'm not doing it
for gratification.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.852
- We're all doing it
for gratification.

20:24.140 --> 20:28.020
- Oh, really?
And what about the real you?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.778
- The real me?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.402
Fuck.

20:32.690 --> 20:36.866
If you prefer I talk
about the structure properties,

20:37.153 --> 20:38.245
composition, reaction,

20:38.529 --> 20:40.531
and preparation
of chemical compounds,

20:40.823 --> 20:42.370
I'll give you another name.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.753
But what the hell are we talking
about all this other stuff for?

20:46.036 --> 20:49.336
This... Is the real me,

20:49.623 --> 20:51.000
and If
you don't understand that,

20:51.292 --> 20:52.589
then what the fuck are we doing?

20:56.589 --> 20:59.684
Do you want to continue, or not?
It's up to you.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.345
- I thought it was...
- Oh, well don't.

21:02.636 --> 21:03.979
Just ask the questions.

21:04.263 --> 21:10.441
- Okay.
That, um, that guy... Arthur.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.401
You want to tell us about him?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.487
- He was married. Two kids.

21:15.775 --> 21:20.406
Had a thing for underwear.
Loved used panties.

21:20.696 --> 21:24.826
0:30, like clockwork.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.666
Except one day, he didn't.

21:27.953 --> 21:29.796
He didn't turn up.

21:30.080 --> 21:33.459
His wife was there instead.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.095
Lucy.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.973
She'd found out about me.

21:40.257 --> 21:41.725
Wanted to meet me.

21:42.009 --> 21:45.639
Wanted to know
what I had that she didn't.

21:45.930 --> 21:48.683
She said she wanted to know what
it felt like to buy someone.

21:48.974 --> 21:50.601
I said, "I'm not for sale."

21:50.893 --> 21:54.067
She took some money out
and put it on the dresser...

21:54.355 --> 21:57.609
And she told me
to take off my panties.

21:57.900 --> 22:00.028
- So, did you do as she said?

22:00.319 --> 22:02.367
- As I was told.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.328
- I was doing my duty.
- Duty'?

22:04.615 --> 22:06.868
- My penance.
- You felt guilty.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.584
- I felt wet.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.593
She lifted up my dress...

22:16.877 --> 22:20.973
Then she gripped the fabric
and just... Pulled it apart...

22:21.257 --> 22:23.225
- tore it.
- Just like that?

22:23.509 --> 22:24.977
- Just like that.

22:25.261 --> 22:28.561
- I can't imagine you
letting anyone do that to do.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.977
- Oh, didn't let her.
She just did it.

22:32.268 --> 22:35.363
Anyway,
that wasn't what bothered me.

22:35.646 --> 22:38.775
It was the way
that she looked at me.

22:39.066 --> 22:43.116
The way she... Examined me.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.163
Then she took off her knickers
and she... Sat on the bed,

22:48.450 --> 22:51.829
and then she just...
Spread her legs...

22:52.121 --> 22:55.842
And she told me to show her
how good I was.

22:56.125 --> 22:59.129
I knelt between her thighs
and I...

22:59.420 --> 23:03.220
I remember looking up
and seeing her smile...

23:03.507 --> 23:06.511
Like she had me
exactly where she wanted me.

23:06.802 --> 23:11.228
She grabbed me by the hair,
and she just pushed me into her.

23:11.515 --> 23:16.863
So deep, I...
I couldn't breathe, you know?

23:17.146 --> 23:21.447
It's funny, but I... I felt this
urge to prove myself, you know,

23:21.734 --> 23:23.862
that I was good...
That I was worth it.

23:24.153 --> 23:25.621
- And she came?

23:25.905 --> 23:30.251
- She came three times before
she let me come up for air.

23:30.534 --> 23:35.005
And then, when she recovered,
she... She said I was okay...

23:35.289 --> 23:38.042
And a lot better
than her husband.

23:39.627 --> 23:40.867
- Then she held up her knickers

23:41.086 --> 23:44.431
and said he'd never
get to smell them again.

23:44.715 --> 23:50.438
And she dropped them on
the carpet..And then she left.

23:50.721 --> 23:52.849
- Just like that?

23:53.140 --> 23:55.438
- Just like that.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.980
It was the end of the session.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.865
Hmm.

24:02.149 --> 24:06.529
- Well, did you...
Ever see her again?

24:09.156 --> 24:12.080
Wow, I don't believe it!

24:14.244 --> 24:15.621
You said you don't believe it.

24:15.913 --> 24:17.665
<i>- W... I...</i>
It's just an expression.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.459
- Is it?
- What?

24:19.750 --> 24:22.469
- Is it real?
- Is what real?

24:22.753 --> 24:27.304
- The story.
It was a fantasy, sweetie.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.720
Oh, some of it was heal.

24:31.011 --> 24:35.687
What? What's wrong?

24:35.975 --> 24:38.273
Oh, come on. Don't be like that.

24:38.560 --> 24:39.686
True? False? Does it matter?

24:39.979 --> 24:41.276
- Of course it matters!
- Why?

24:41.563 --> 24:43.531
Does everything have to be fact
to be valuable?

24:43.816 --> 24:45.417
So, goodbye chaucer,
goodbye Shakespeare.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.847
- But they were writing fiction.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.366
They didn't pretend it was true.
- Yeah? So'?

24:48.654 --> 24:50.215
When you read a book
or you see a movie,

24:50.447 --> 24:52.008
you believe it, don't you?
I mean, I do.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.993
You know, when the monster
jumps out from behind the door,

24:54.284 --> 24:56.324
you scream because you're there.
You're right there.

24:56.370 --> 24:57.872
Otherwise,
it wouldn't mean anything.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.665
- Yeah, but this is different.
This is supposed to be real.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.677
- It is real!
It's as real as anything else.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.252
Geez, the fact that I may or may
not have made up a few things

25:03.544 --> 25:04.921
is just part of me.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.965
It's who I am and how I work.
It's what makes me me.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.430
And I'm the person
you're interviewing.

25:16.849 --> 25:20.729
Do you have any other questions?

25:21.020 --> 25:22.567
- Sure.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.952
All right.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.283
So, when you're making love
with a client...

25:30.571 --> 25:32.073
- I don't make love.
- Having sex.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.365
- Fucking.
- Fine.

25:33.657 --> 25:35.580
How do you separate love
and sex?

25:35.868 --> 25:36.869
- With a condom.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.163
- But isn't sex
a-an expression of love?

25:39.455 --> 25:41.335
- I assume you're
being deliberately contentious

25:41.498 --> 25:43.938
rather than just plain stupid.
- I think It's a fair question.

25:44.084 --> 25:46.044
- Really? They're two
completely different things.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.851
- Well, that's not
what most people think.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.645
- Well, It's like blackberries
and apples.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.520
You put them together,
they make great pie,

25:51.759 --> 25:52.760
but they're equally as good
on their own.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.178
- Okay. Forget love.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.814
Do even like your clients?
- Most of them.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.599
- What do you like about them?

25:58.891 --> 26:00.313
- I told you... their money.

26:00.601 --> 26:02.353
- That all'?
- It's a good start.

26:02.644 --> 26:04.772
- What about their personalities?

26:05.064 --> 26:06.862
- First money, then... Smell.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.867
Then personality.
- You like their smell?

26:09.151 --> 26:10.619
- Some of them.
- What If you don't?

26:10.903 --> 26:13.156
- I hold my breath.
- It's that important?

26:13.447 --> 26:14.494
- Of course it is.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.001
Penetrates deeper
than a tongue or a penis.

26:17.284 --> 26:18.706
It goes right inside you.

26:18.994 --> 26:22.089
The only thing that can
penetrate deeper is the truth.

26:22.372 --> 26:26.548
That's why the best sex
is always after an argument.

26:26.835 --> 26:30.590
It's... When you're
most vulnerable and honest.

26:30.881 --> 26:33.725
Warts and all, everything's
on the table, you know?

26:34.009 --> 26:36.637
- Yeah, but when you're working,
It's different, isn't it?

26:36.929 --> 26:37.896
- In what way?

26:38.180 --> 26:39.501
- Well,
you don't open up to them.

26:39.556 --> 26:40.853
- Oh, don't I?
- You tell me.

26:41.141 --> 26:43.189
- Of course I do, honey.
I open up real wide.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.945
- I didn't mean it like that.

26:45.229 --> 26:47.527
- I'm more honest with them
than most of their wives are.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.318
And I can tell you for a fact,
they're more honest with me.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.690
- Yeah, but only about sex.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.324
- Oh, about anything...
everything!

26:53.612 --> 26:55.831
You know, It's like
a confession, except a real one.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.958
I don't hold back...
neither do they.

26:58.242 --> 27:00.495
Then they fuck, they shower,
they leave all clean.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.254
- What about you?
- What about me?

27:02.538 --> 27:04.711
- Do you leave all clean?

27:04.998 --> 27:06.875
- Depends.
- On what?

27:07.167 --> 27:08.214
- Don't know.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.971
- You must know.
- I don't.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.976
- How many clients
have you slept with?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.934
- Next.
- You're not prepared to answer?

27:19.221 --> 27:21.223
- It's a dumb question.
- Why?

27:21.515 --> 27:22.983
- Because I don't count.

27:23.267 --> 27:25.861
It's also got
that moral undercurrent

27:26.145 --> 27:27.863
that you keep going back to.
- It's a simple question.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.547
- Yeah.
What's interesting about it?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.025
- It's the kind of thing
people like to know.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.283
- And why?

27:32.568 --> 27:33.768
- I guess because most of them

27:33.986 --> 27:35.533
haven't had
as many partners as you.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.949
- They're not my partners.
- Sexual partners, th en.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.743
0 years?

27:41.034 --> 27:42.251
- It's different.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.083
- Mm. Okay. All right.
I'll work it out for you.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.873
Let me see. Um...

27:46.165 --> 27:48.714
Okay,
on average, three per shift.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.504
That's...5 shifts per week...

27:51.795 --> 27:55.015
5 times, I don't know,
30 weeks per year...

27:55.299 --> 27:57.051
5 times 30... that's 450.

27:57.342 --> 28:01.313
Then 10 years, take a way
<i>2</i> when I was in Europe... Oh.

28:01.597 --> 28:05.943
Uh, 450 times 8. 3,600.

28:06.226 --> 28:08.649
3,600 fucks!
God, I hope you're impressed.

28:08.937 --> 28:10.154
- Should I be?

28:10.439 --> 28:12.316
- Oh, you try working that out
in your head.

28:12.608 --> 28:15.077
Sorry, I thought you meant...

28:15.360 --> 28:16.361
- Yeah, I know you did.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.200
Okay,
what else do you want to know...

28:18.488 --> 28:20.115
how many blowjobs,
how many orgasms?

28:20.407 --> 28:23.456
I know. How many toes...
Fit in a foot fetish's mouth.

28:23.744 --> 28:25.838
- You like to manipulate,
don't you?

28:26.121 --> 28:27.964
- Do you know the answer?
- What?

28:28.248 --> 28:30.922
- To how many toes
fit in a foot fetish's mouth.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.757
- Six.
- Why six?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.844
- Well, 'cause that's the answer.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.061
Come on, ask me something else.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.268
- How often do you orgasm
with your clients?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.933
- Real or fake?
- I guess that's my question.

28:46.225 --> 28:47.317
- Yeah, thought it was.

28:47.601 --> 28:49.854
What do you think?
- How would I know?

28:50.145 --> 28:51.271
- Men never do.

28:51.563 --> 28:54.066
You've seen so many porn
and Hollywood versions,

28:54.358 --> 28:56.736
you've got no idea
what's real anymore.

28:58.654 --> 28:59.951
- Have you seen the film
"when Harry met Sally..."?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.741
- Oh, yeah. God, wasn't it great?

29:02.032 --> 29:04.410
She was so real!

29:07.204 --> 29:09.377
Oh, my God!

29:09.665 --> 29:12.168
Hmm. We don't even have to try.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.712
- You didn't find her convincing?

29:15.003 --> 29:17.176
- No. There wasn't enough pain.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.182
- Pain'?
- On her face.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.889
- So women feel pain
when they have an orgasm?

29:22.177 --> 29:25.147
- Yeah, I do.
- So It's... Not pleasurable?

29:25.430 --> 29:26.773
- I didn't say that.

29:27.057 --> 29:29.560
The more pleasure,
the more pain.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.452
It's, um,
something you guys miss out on.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.087
If you... If you didn't, you'd
probably understand us better.

29:34.106 --> 29:35.467
- I'm... I'm sorry.
You've lost me.

29:35.649 --> 29:38.072
- Yeah, of course I have.
I don't know.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.330
Look, It's not something
you can put into words.

29:41.613 --> 29:42.990
It's something you feel.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.829
It's part of being a woman.

29:45.117 --> 29:48.041
It's not just sex,
It's... It's our whole being.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.705
You think about, It's...

29:49.997 --> 29:51.795
Childbirth... pleasure or pain?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.959
- Pain.
- Yeah. Of course.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.298
And pleasure.

29:55.585 --> 29:58.259
One of the greatest pleasures
possible.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.345
You just think
we have mood swings, you know,

30:00.632 --> 30:01.872
we're full of contradictions...

30:02.009 --> 30:03.431
premenstrual,
that sort of thing...

30:03.719 --> 30:07.815
but... We are the highs
and the lows...

30:08.098 --> 30:10.226
In the most minute detail.

30:10.517 --> 30:14.272
When you shoot, that's it...
straight, linear, relief, done.

30:14.563 --> 30:16.065
It's not like that for us.

30:16.356 --> 30:18.029
- So, you do fake it?

30:18.317 --> 30:21.696
- You're so male!

30:21.987 --> 30:23.079
Does it matter?

30:23.363 --> 30:25.036
Yeah, of course it does.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.418
It's very important, isn't it?

30:27.701 --> 30:29.453
It's not just male ego, is it?

30:29.745 --> 30:31.918
Well,
It's not entirely male ego.

30:32.205 --> 30:34.333
It's more than that.
It's, um...

30:34.624 --> 30:38.674
It's ownership... And power.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.384
It's primal.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.390
If you can give women
that amount of intense pleasure

30:42.674 --> 30:45.268
and pain, then you've finally
got something to offer.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.180
Sticking your dick in her cunt
may give you children,

30:48.472 --> 30:50.224
but it'll never give you
the woman.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.643
You've got to do more than that.
You know it.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.278
And she does, too.

30:55.562 --> 30:58.782
Do you know what
the most common fantasy is...

30:59.066 --> 31:01.194
With all the guys
that come to see me?

31:01.485 --> 31:03.738
- Uh, I don't know.
Being with two women?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.282
- No.
- Oral?

31:06.573 --> 31:08.667
- No.

31:08.950 --> 31:10.452
You know,
there's only one fantasy

31:10.744 --> 31:12.872
that they all have in common...
every one of them.

31:13.163 --> 31:16.542
And It's that I'm getting off
on it... for real.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.211
That even though I'm working
and they're a customer,

31:19.503 --> 31:20.675
they're so fucking good at it

31:20.962 --> 31:23.806
that I can't help
but get turned on.

31:24.091 --> 31:25.593
- Right, so you do fake it.

31:25.884 --> 31:28.182
- Of course. It's what I do.
- Right.

31:28.470 --> 31:30.063
- However, when I don't fake one,

31:30.347 --> 31:32.520
It's because
I don't much like the man,

31:32.808 --> 31:34.248
or he hasn't been trying
hard enough.

31:34.351 --> 31:36.192
- Well, he's paying you.
Why should he have to?

31:36.228 --> 31:38.731
- You get what you pay for,
you know?

31:39.022 --> 31:40.615
Cash means you get a fuck.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.901
Effort means you might get more.

31:43.193 --> 31:46.163
- Hmm. All right, what about
when you're not working...

31:46.446 --> 31:48.039
do you still fake orgasms then?

31:48.323 --> 31:49.803
- Boyfriends
are completely different.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.388
- Do you always tell them
what you do?

31:51.535 --> 31:54.664
- No. Not always.
- Why not?

31:54.955 --> 31:57.003
You mean, so, like,

31:57.290 --> 31:59.292
when a guy in a bar asks me
If I'd like a drink,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.052
I should say,
"yeah, yeah, thanks,

32:01.336 --> 32:02.462
"I'd love a Bundy and coke,

32:02.754 --> 32:03.971
and, by the way,
did you know I'm a hooker?"

32:04.256 --> 32:05.776
- All right, then,
what about later on,

32:05.882 --> 32:07.555
after you've been dating
for awhile?

32:07.843 --> 32:09.043
- It's not always that simple.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.394
- Why?

32:10.679 --> 32:11.896
- Because it creates issues
for some guys...

32:12.180 --> 32:14.478
like, first they want to know
all the details,

32:14.766 --> 32:16.768
and then they become all funny
about it.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.563
It... it wouldn't matter If he'd
slept with hundreds of women.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.732
You know, he'd judge me
for doing it for money,

32:22.023 --> 32:24.776
or only dirty drug addicts
or hookers...

32:25.068 --> 32:28.197
"Oh, she's a slut,
and I can't be with a slut."

32:28.488 --> 32:31.241
- Okay.

32:31.533 --> 32:33.956
Why don't we get back t... um...

32:34.244 --> 32:36.713
Fantasies.

32:36.997 --> 32:39.967
Do you have a favorite fantasy?

32:40.250 --> 32:43.595
- I might.

32:43.879 --> 32:46.348
It's the casting couch.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.510
I get to, um, you know, dress
up, and put on my Marilyn wig.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.145
Do you want to know how it goes?
- No, not really.

32:52.429 --> 32:53.897
- Of course you do.

32:54.181 --> 32:56.479
All right, well,
it starts off with me...

32:56.766 --> 32:59.394
me asking him questions
about the script, so...

32:59.686 --> 33:01.780
And then I read a few lines.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.737
"Hi. My names Angie."

33:05.025 --> 33:07.198
I-I start off all confused
and uncertain,

33:07.486 --> 33:09.659
but I'm so desperate
to get in the movie,

33:09.946 --> 33:10.993
do you know what I do?

33:11.281 --> 33:13.158
I expose my breasts.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.999
And at first, he resists.
He's all... Professional.

33:16.286 --> 33:19.665
He -— he tells me
I'm being inappropriate, and...

33:19.956 --> 33:22.630
Do you know what's next?
- I can guess.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.216
- It is pretty predictable.
I do end up, you know,

33:25.504 --> 33:27.973
bent over the couch
with him fucking me from behind.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.556
So, whilst he's doing it,
I start reading the lines again,

33:31.843 --> 33:33.561
and as I build up
to this big crescendo,

33:33.845 --> 33:35.347
he starts coming on
with all these,

33:35.639 --> 33:38.017
"Oh, yeah, baby.
That's great, babe."

33:38.308 --> 33:40.402
"Let's do it together, babe."

33:40.685 --> 33:42.779
And then... That's it.

33:43.063 --> 33:44.235
He's done.

33:44.523 --> 33:47.493
- So, are you trying
to tell me something?

33:47.776 --> 33:49.153
- Tell you what?

33:50.237 --> 33:52.990
Oh. <i>I</i> see.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.659
Movie director, casting couch.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.328
You, me, Marilyn.

33:57.619 --> 34:00.668
That's just a coincidence,
sweetie.

34:00.956 --> 34:03.926
You wouldn't have the balls.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.884
Do you know what you are?
- What?

34:08.170 --> 34:09.717
- You're a vagina man.

34:10.005 --> 34:13.101
Vagina men...
they're afraid of women.

34:13.385 --> 34:15.137
Most men are vagina men.

34:15.428 --> 34:18.022
Cunt men aren't,
but you're no cunt man.

34:18.306 --> 34:20.684
You don't even like
saying the word.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.855
- It's just a word.
- Oh, don't worry about it.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.694
There's nothing
wrong with being a vagina man.

34:26.982 --> 34:31.783
You just got to make sure
you find yourself a penis girl.

34:32.070 --> 34:35.074
Do you know what a cunt man
wants in a woman'?

34:35.364 --> 34:38.414
- No, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me anyway.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.329
- A wet woman.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.121
- Meaning?

34:42.414 --> 34:45.338
- Means what it Says... a-a wet
woman, a woman who gets wet.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.092
- Oh, when she's excited.

34:47.377 --> 34:49.094
Maybe all the time.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.882
I-It's not so much a statement
about the woman...

34:52.172 --> 34:53.719
It's more about the man.

34:54.009 --> 34:56.888
So, a man who can take a wet
woman is a man who likes women.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.272
It's the biggest point
of difference.

34:59.556 --> 35:02.526
Most men aren't wet men.
They're dry.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.028
That's why the really dry men,

35:05.312 --> 35:08.486
they take a shower
straight after sex...

35:08.773 --> 35:10.400
to get rid of the wet.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.536
To get rid of her
and all that nastiness.

35:13.820 --> 35:18.121
But she... If she's a wet woman,
she's wet everywhere.

35:18.408 --> 35:23.710
The outside, inside,
in her brain.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.091
Female sex is wet.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.092
Women are wet.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.844
Men are dry.

35:30.128 --> 35:31.254
Did you know that?

35:31.546 --> 35:33.765
- Can't say
I'd ever thought about it, no.

35:35.342 --> 35:37.140
That's because
you're a vagina man.

35:37.427 --> 35:38.394
- Right.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.022
I knew a woman once.

35:41.306 --> 35:45.061
She used to like to strap on
a dildo and penetrate men.

35:45.352 --> 35:47.821
- Did you?
- Yes, I did.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.526
- Was her name matilda?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.658
- My question is,
what does that make her?

35:52.942 --> 35:55.143
- It makes her a woman who likes
to fuck a man's bottom.

35:55.362 --> 35:56.784
- Yes, obviously,

35:57.072 --> 35:58.289
but I meant in the context
of what we're talking about.

35:58.573 --> 36:01.372
- Something different again.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.786
Sex isn't about pleasure.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.172
- You said sex was about pleasure
and pain.

36:05.455 --> 36:08.379
- No, I said women
are about pleasure and pain.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.386
Sex is about procreation
and power.

36:11.670 --> 36:15.391
Anal sex has nothing to do
with procreation, so...

36:15.674 --> 36:17.301
That just leaves power.

36:17.592 --> 36:20.186
So when she buggers him,
who's in control?

36:20.470 --> 36:21.722
- She is.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.515
- And when she did it to you,
what did you feel?

36:23.807 --> 36:25.087
- I never said she did it to me.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.940
- If she did it to you,
what would you feel?

36:29.813 --> 36:31.156
- Vulnerable, I suppose.

36:31.439 --> 36:32.440
- Why?

36:32.732 --> 36:37.704
- Well, because...
I would be at her mercy.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.911
- You would, wouldn't you?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.122
On your knees,
head down, taking it.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.662
What, like a woman?

36:44.953 --> 36:47.001
So women are at your mercy
when you fuck them'?

36:47.288 --> 36:49.882
- Hang on, <i>I</i> didn't say that.
- Yes, you on).

36:50.166 --> 36:53.136
When you fuck a woman, you know,
spread her legs, penetrate her,

36:53.420 --> 36:55.593
she's at your mercy...
vulnerable... isn't she?

36:55.880 --> 36:57.006
No.

36:57.298 --> 37:00.017
Then you must be
a really bad fuck.

37:00.301 --> 37:02.099
You know what? Why both er?

37:02.387 --> 37:04.389
D-do you ever find matilda,
you know,

37:04.681 --> 37:06.183
watching TV
while you're doing it?

37:06.474 --> 37:07.976
Because that's
what I'd be doing.

37:08.268 --> 37:10.646
Geez, man, just go for it!
For once, just take control.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.406
Just fuck her... like no
tomorrow, like she deserves it.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.771
- Christ, If I said that...

37:14.983 --> 37:16.576
- Oh, what...
you'd be a misogynist?

37:16.860 --> 37:18.487
- Yes!
- You are a fucking misogynist.

37:18.778 --> 37:20.951
- I do not hate women!
- Oh, you are polite to them.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.458
You respect them.
You treat them courteously.

37:23.742 --> 37:25.862
Isn't that all right?
- You're just gonna twist around

37:25.952 --> 37:27.232
whatever I say.
- Oh, but surely,

37:27.454 --> 37:28.694
- that's all true.
- Yes, it is.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.130
- And you'd never want
to hurt them, would you?

37:30.415 --> 37:31.462
No.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.173
So, there you go.
- "There you go" what?

37:34.461 --> 37:36.179
- You're the perfect gentleman.

37:36.463 --> 37:38.056
How can you not want
to penetrate the woman you love?

37:38.339 --> 37:39.431
- I do!

37:39.716 --> 37:42.435
- Oh, yeah,
with a little poke and a shower.

37:42.719 --> 37:44.062
If you really loved her,

37:44.345 --> 37:47.349
you'd want to penetrate her
so deeply, it would hurt.

37:47.640 --> 37:49.313
- I would never want to hurt her.

37:49.601 --> 37:52.980
- I'm talking about hurting her
and you... at the same time.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.070
Hurt till you can't bear it
anymore, and then...

37:56.357 --> 38:00.078
And at that moment...
She'll possess you... equally.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.490
You'll both have given up...
To each other.

38:03.782 --> 38:07.082
And that's when a man
starts to love a woman.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.417
That's when he starts
to understand her.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.504
I need a break.
- Well, we're not stopping now.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.514
That's easy for you to say.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.766
I'm the one doing all the work.

38:22.050 --> 38:26.556
How much research did you do
for this film?

38:26.846 --> 38:29.975
Have you ever been to a hooker?

38:32.018 --> 38:35.443
So, what did you do?

38:35.730 --> 38:37.152
- Not much.
- Oh, come on.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.784
You must have got something
for you money.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.035
- We had sex.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.242
- Oh, wow. Really?

38:43.530 --> 38:45.908
Did you tell wifey?

38:46.199 --> 38:49.419
- It happened before we met.

38:49.702 --> 38:52.751
- That wasn't my question.

38:53.039 --> 38:55.963
- She never asked.
- You never thought to tell her.

38:56.251 --> 38:57.878
- I didn't think
it was appropriate, no.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.342
- Oh, b-because good boys
don't do that sort of thing?

39:00.630 --> 39:01.722
- I suppose so.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.508
- So, why tell her now?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.222
She... she'll see this film
when It's finished, won't she?

39:05.510 --> 39:07.558
So... She's gonna find out.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.723
What's she gonna think?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.134
- How the fuck should I know?
- Well, you should know.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.151
And you should care, too.
That's how it works.

39:14.185 --> 39:15.665
- Well,
thank you for the free advice.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.355
- Hey, sweetie,
I'm just trying to help.

39:17.647 --> 39:19.274
- What,
w... now you're my therapist, eh?

39:19.566 --> 39:20.647
- I can be anyone you want.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.119
I can be anyone you want.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.994
Truth Oh dare'?

39:27.282 --> 39:30.206
Truth Oh dare'?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.166
Truth Oh dare'?

39:32.453 --> 39:35.206
What? Choose it.
You're such fucking hard work.

39:35.498 --> 39:37.751
It's because
you don't have a hard-on.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.043
That's the problem.

39:39.335 --> 39:42.259
- What makes you hard?
- What?

39:42.547 --> 39:44.094
- You heard me.
- Foreplay.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.384
- Foreplay.
What kind of foreplay?

39:46.676 --> 39:48.019
- Intimate foreplay.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.976
- Like what we're doing now?
- This isn't foreplay.

39:50.263 --> 39:52.061
- Are you sure?

39:52.348 --> 39:54.350
Sometimes, foreplay can just
sneak up behind you

39:54.642 --> 39:55.642
when you least expect it.

39:55.894 --> 39:57.612
Do you know what I mean?
- Not really, no.

39:57.896 --> 39:58.943
- You're supposed to
tell the truth.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.470
- I am.
- I don't think you are.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.025
- Well, that's your problem,
isn't it?

40:02.317 --> 40:04.160
- Well, actually, you know what?
It's your fucking problem.

40:04.444 --> 40:07.118
Because now I get to give you
a dare.

40:07.405 --> 40:11.410
Take off your clothes.
- I'm sorry?

40:11.701 --> 40:13.078
- I know you are,
but It's too late for that.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.730
- I didn't mean
that kind of sorry.

40:14.996 --> 40:16.293
- I don't give a shit
what sort of sorry you meant.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.878
- Can we get back
to the interview, please?

40:18.166 --> 40:20.965
- This is the interview.
- Me interviewing you!

40:23.713 --> 40:26.307
- First, I've got to make sure
that you're clean.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.719
And don't think
you're anything special.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.354
I inspect all my clients.
- I am not a client.

40:31.638 --> 40:33.857
- Oh, no,
of course you're not, honey.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.768
You're a big movie director.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.487
So, why don't
you start getting your gear off,

40:40.730 --> 40:42.573
then we can get things rolling?

40:47.445 --> 40:50.995
I haven't got all day, you know.
Huh?

40:55.161 --> 40:56.504
Okay. Fine.

40:56.788 --> 40:59.211
If you don't want to play,
that's your choice.

40:59.499 --> 41:00.796
- Where are you going?

41:01.084 --> 41:02.885
Angie, we had a deal.
- Bye-bye. Ta-ta. Ta-ta.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.174
- Angie. Angie!

41:04.462 --> 41:06.715
Fuck's sake.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.351
Don't do anything.
Just keep rolling.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.979
Angie?

41:14.263 --> 41:15.765
Listen. Listen.

41:16.057 --> 41:18.151
Can we just talk about it,
please?

41:18.434 --> 41:21.563
- And what exactly
didn't you understand?

41:21.854 --> 41:25.700
Take your fucking clothes off,
or I'm out of here.

41:25.984 --> 41:27.827
It's really very simple.

41:31.489 --> 41:35.084
I haven't got all day, you know.
Hmm?

41:35.368 --> 41:36.961
- Come back inside.

41:37.245 --> 41:39.213
- You'll get undressed?

41:39.497 --> 41:42.592
- Yes. I...
- Finally! Thank you...

41:42.875 --> 41:44.343
- Okay.

41:46.000 --> 41:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

42:00.727 --> 42:03.731
Okay, everyone else,
out of the room.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.572
You. You. Out.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.827
Trust me,
you don't want them to be here.

42:10.111 --> 42:12.079
- How long do you want them
to go out for?

42:12.363 --> 42:14.115
- For as long as it takes.

42:14.407 --> 42:16.626
And, uh, leave the cameras on.

42:21.164 --> 42:25.044
- What do you want to do?

42:25.334 --> 42:29.305
- Okay. Lock off the cameras.

42:29.589 --> 42:32.889
- To what?
- Just lock off the cameras.

42:33.176 --> 42:37.556
- Lock off the cameras.
Just lock off the cameras.

42:37.847 --> 42:39.224
Come on!

42:39.515 --> 42:43.190
- All right, jan. Get 'em out.

42:43.478 --> 42:45.856
- All right, everyone.
You heard the director.

42:46.147 --> 42:47.319
Let's... Clear the studio.

42:47.607 --> 42:49.200
Thank you.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.782
Thank you Mr. director.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.573
Come on, come on, come on.

42:54.864 --> 42:58.209
Don't worry.
Everything's under control.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.040
- Thank you. That's everyone.

43:00.328 --> 43:01.500
- That's everyone.

43:01.788 --> 43:04.132
If he's a good boy,
you can all come back.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.009
Wear a short skirt.
It'd suit you, darling.

43:10.296 --> 43:11.798
Thank you, thank you.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.933
And close the door, yeah?
Bye-bye.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.970
- Thank you.
- All clear.

43:17.261 --> 43:20.481
- All clear.

43:20.765 --> 43:23.894
Hmm.

43:28.981 --> 43:32.611
That's better, isn't it?

43:32.902 --> 43:35.951
Just the two of us.

43:38.241 --> 43:41.165
Oh, come on.
What's with that sour face?

43:41.452 --> 43:45.423
You made me take my top off,
show my tit-ties to the world.

43:45.706 --> 43:47.307
- That's different.
You volunteered that.

43:47.333 --> 43:48.654
- Yeah,
now we negotiated a price,

43:48.918 --> 43:51.012
just like we're doing now.

43:51.295 --> 43:54.640
Do people go
and see unfinished films?

43:54.924 --> 43:56.972
- No.
- No. I didn't think so.

43:57.260 --> 44:01.265
Before we started, I didn't have
very much to bargain with,

44:01.556 --> 44:03.979
but I do now, don't I?

44:05.268 --> 44:06.861
That was a question.

44:07.145 --> 44:08.567
- Yes.
- Yes.

44:08.855 --> 44:10.482
So, there you go.

44:10.773 --> 44:14.198
Do you remember
the casting couch?

44:14.485 --> 44:17.409
Well, this is the other version.

44:17.697 --> 44:21.452
In this version,
she gets to fuck him,

44:21.742 --> 44:22.868
and he gets to find out

44:23.161 --> 44:25.289
what It's like
to be on the other side...

44:25.580 --> 44:27.457
ass up, head down.
Do you know what I mean?

44:27.748 --> 44:30.001
Are you with me?

44:30.293 --> 44:31.465
You told me before we started

44:31.752 --> 44:33.095
that I could do or say
anything I wanted...

44:33.379 --> 44:36.553
that you wanted to figure out
what made me tick.

44:36.841 --> 44:39.014
Well, I'm ticking.

44:41.971 --> 44:43.393
Take off your clothes.

44:43.681 --> 44:45.558
You've got
till the count of three.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.397
One!

44:47.685 --> 44:49.107
Two!

44:58.154 --> 44:59.997
- Can I at least
leave my underwear on?

45:00.281 --> 45:03.831
- Yeah, right.

45:04.118 --> 45:06.246
But you can leave your socks on.

45:06.537 --> 45:11.259
Men look so ridiculous
with just their socks on.

45:11.542 --> 45:13.089
Don't you agree?

45:13.377 --> 45:15.345
Was that a yes or a no?

45:15.630 --> 45:17.507
- Yes.
- "Yes" what?

45:17.798 --> 45:20.051
- What's my name?
- Angie.

45:20.343 --> 45:21.595
- Angie?

45:21.886 --> 45:24.355
What, your little fantasy girl
from next door?

45:24.639 --> 45:25.731
I don't think so.

45:26.015 --> 45:27.232
Underpants.

45:27.516 --> 45:30.190
Come on.

45:39.362 --> 45:42.081
Hmm.

45:43.491 --> 45:45.789
Now stand up straight.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.205
Hands to your side.

45:48.496 --> 45:52.342
Hmm.

45:52.625 --> 45:55.845
Turn around.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.880
Turn around!

45:58.172 --> 45:59.799
That's your last warning.

46:00.091 --> 46:01.932
The next time you don't
follow my instructions,

46:02.051 --> 46:03.612
and I mean immediately,
I'm out of here.

46:03.803 --> 46:05.350
- Is that clear?
- Yes.

46:05.638 --> 46:07.766
- Good.
Then we understand each other.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.981
Face me.

46:11.269 --> 46:14.273
You know,
they're waiting to find out

46:14.563 --> 46:16.406
what's gonna happen next.

46:16.691 --> 46:18.568
They want to know
how far you're prepared to go

46:18.859 --> 46:20.577
for this little film of yours.

46:20.861 --> 46:24.286
So... How far will you go?

46:24.573 --> 46:26.041
- Not far.

46:26.325 --> 46:27.827
- Oh,
you are such a fucking wimp!

46:28.119 --> 46:29.496
- Well, If that's what you think.

46:29.787 --> 46:35.009
- I'll tell you what.
I will let you redeem yourself

46:35.293 --> 46:37.091
I'll give you
one more instruction,

46:37.378 --> 46:39.221
and If you do it
to my satisfaction,

46:39.505 --> 46:41.428
I'll let you
put your clothes back on.

46:41.716 --> 46:42.683
Deal?

46:42.967 --> 46:44.594
- Depends.
- Depends?

46:44.885 --> 46:46.603
Wrong answer, sweetie.

46:46.887 --> 46:48.639
Play with yourself

46:48.931 --> 46:53.858
you must have seen that coming.

46:54.145 --> 46:58.150
I haven't got all day. Huh?

47:03.446 --> 47:06.666
How does this work?
- You shouldn't touch that.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.451
- No, no, no.
- Don't touch that!

47:08.743 --> 47:09.835
- I know, I know, I know, I
shouldn't touch it, but look...

47:10.119 --> 47:11.166
I'm touching it.

47:11.454 --> 47:15.459
Uh-huh.
So, where is that naked man?

47:15.750 --> 47:17.844
He can't be too far.

47:18.127 --> 47:21.301
I'll stop when you start, okay?

47:21.589 --> 47:23.808
How much fun is this?

47:24.091 --> 47:26.844
It's like a giant strap-on.

47:28.387 --> 47:30.936
It's like
a heat-seeking missile.

47:31.223 --> 47:33.066
Are you hot, my dear?

47:33.351 --> 47:36.571
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, not me, sweetie.

47:36.854 --> 47:39.653
Up, going down, and... Going up!

47:39.940 --> 47:42.068
Oh, this is just like
target practice,

47:42.360 --> 47:44.533
and you're
my little Clay pigeon.

47:44.820 --> 47:46.367
- I hope you're having fun.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.032
Okay.

47:48.324 --> 47:49.917
Okay, I'm doing it.

48:02.588 --> 48:06.183
- Sort of disappears
in your hand, doesn't it?

48:06.467 --> 48:09.220
It's such
a precious little thing.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.891
You got a name for it? Uh-huh?

48:13.182 --> 48:14.479
Do you know,

48:14.767 --> 48:16.608
I have never understood
why men give it a name.

48:16.727 --> 48:24.727
And It's always a male one...
one-eyed Fred, Pedro, Simon.

48:25.611 --> 48:28.911
So gorgeously gay.

48:29.198 --> 48:32.042
There's even a website
where you can register the name.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.545
- Hope you're satisfied.
- What did you say?

48:34.829 --> 48:36.581
- I said,
I hope you're satisfied.

48:36.872 --> 48:37.839
- Did you?

48:38.124 --> 48:39.546
Oh, thank you, my sweet.

48:39.834 --> 48:42.087
No, I'm not,
but I'm getting there.

48:42.378 --> 48:45.348
- Are we done?
- Oh, look... concentrate!

48:45.631 --> 48:49.306
You clearly can't do two things
at the same time.

48:49.593 --> 48:53.348
- You said If I followed
your instructions, that I...

48:53.639 --> 48:56.483
- yes, yes, yes, yes, I know.
Oh, God!

48:56.767 --> 48:59.395
Don't quote me back
on everything!

48:59.687 --> 49:02.281
And keep going!
Who told you to stop?

49:03.482 --> 49:06.736
You don't even know
how to wank properly.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.031
- Fuck!
- Fucking faster.

49:10.322 --> 49:12.199
I shouldn't have to show you
how It's done.

49:12.491 --> 49:14.038
You're old enough
to know better.

49:14.326 --> 49:15.703
Faster!

49:15.995 --> 49:17.338
- Agh!

49:17.621 --> 49:18.964
- There you go.

49:19.248 --> 49:23.048
You just needed
a little encouragement.

49:23.335 --> 49:24.712
You can stop.

49:27.590 --> 49:29.558
I'm getting bored.

49:29.842 --> 49:32.345
You know, you are boring.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.229
Quite pathetic.

49:34.513 --> 49:36.811
What are you?

49:37.099 --> 49:40.319
Hmm?

49:40.603 --> 49:41.650
I'm waiting.

49:41.937 --> 49:42.904
I can't hear you.

49:43.189 --> 49:44.657
I'm waiting.

49:44.940 --> 49:46.408
- I'm boring.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.160
- And...?

49:48.444 --> 49:49.912
And...?!

49:50.196 --> 49:53.416
- Pathetic.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.201
- No, you're not.

49:55.493 --> 49:58.542
You can get dressed now.
We're done.

49:58.829 --> 50:03.050
So, next Wednesday, same time?

50:03.334 --> 50:06.008
- Maybe not, eh?

50:06.295 --> 50:08.923
I'll check my diary.

50:09.215 --> 50:12.139
- You okay?
- Sure.

50:12.426 --> 50:15.521
- Really?

50:15.804 --> 50:18.398
- Yeah.
- I wasn't too hard on you?

50:18.682 --> 50:20.229
- You had your moments.

50:20.518 --> 50:23.522
- I can be a lot stricter
than that. Mm-hmm.

50:23.812 --> 50:25.332
I wasn't sure
you'd go through with it.

50:25.523 --> 50:26.803
- Well, If It's any consolation,

50:27.066 --> 50:29.160
I wasn't sure
I'd go through with it, either.

50:29.443 --> 50:31.070
- I felt like
giving you a big hug.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.163
- Fuck me,
it didn't feel like it.

50:33.322 --> 50:34.414
- Of course not.

50:34.698 --> 50:37.372
Wouldn't have meant anything
If it had.

50:39.537 --> 50:41.210
Do you get off on it?

50:41.497 --> 50:43.215
Being the dominatrix?

50:43.499 --> 50:45.547
- Thought that was obvious.

50:45.834 --> 50:49.259
- And what about someone
doing it do you?

50:49.547 --> 50:53.427
- Yeah. I can go there.

50:53.717 --> 50:55.390
Mm-hmm.

50:56.887 --> 50:57.934
What?

50:58.222 --> 50:59.815
Why are you looking at me
like that?

51:00.099 --> 51:03.069
- I just... Thought you'd like
to be in control of everything.

51:03.352 --> 51:05.070
- I do, when I'm working.

51:05.354 --> 51:07.482
- So you don't do it for money.

51:07.773 --> 51:11.198
- Um... Others do. I don't.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.658
For me, It's not like sex.

51:13.946 --> 51:15.994
Sex can be work or play.

51:16.282 --> 51:18.284
I can turn it on or off.

51:18.576 --> 51:22.126
But submission... It's different.

51:22.413 --> 51:25.041
It's got to be a lot of trust.

51:25.332 --> 51:27.300
And you can't fake it.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.838
At least, I can't fake it.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.928
Can fake pleasure, but not pain.

51:33.215 --> 51:35.343
Do you know what I mean?

51:35.634 --> 51:38.137
It's hard to describe.

51:38.429 --> 51:43.651
You know the feeling
when you're so happy...

51:43.934 --> 51:47.939
That you want to cry, or you're
so sad that you want to laugh?

51:48.230 --> 51:49.527
It's a bit like that.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.910
The pleasure starts to build up
until it hurts,

51:53.193 --> 51:55.742
and then the pain
starts to feel good.

51:56.030 --> 51:57.748
- Can it do that?

51:58.032 --> 51:59.955
- Yeah.

52:00.242 --> 52:04.372
And It's like,
I want it to stop...

52:04.663 --> 52:08.918
But I also want it
to go on forever.

52:09.209 --> 52:12.554
- It's so confusing.
- Uh-huh.

52:12.838 --> 52:15.762
- Oh, I just got it.

52:18.302 --> 52:22.728
It doesn't happen always,
but... When it does,

52:23.015 --> 52:26.565
It's very...
Very, very, very nice.

52:36.445 --> 52:38.288
Should we ask them
to come back in?

52:41.367 --> 52:43.916
- Yeah, I suppose we should.

52:48.874 --> 52:51.627
- You can come in now!

52:53.587 --> 52:58.184
Just for the record, I'm so glad
you told them to leave.

52:58.467 --> 52:59.639
- Oh, I wouldn't worry.

52:59.927 --> 53:02.396
No one's gonna believe
you did anything anyway.

53:02.680 --> 53:05.058
They're gonna think
it was all make believe.

53:06.767 --> 53:08.815
If I asked you to do it
in front of the cameras,

53:09.103 --> 53:10.275
would you have done it?

53:10.562 --> 53:12.485
- Absolutely not.
- Why?

53:12.773 --> 53:15.822
- Uh, for 100 obvious reasons...
not the least of which,

53:16.110 --> 53:18.533
I wouldn't have been able
to release the film.

53:18.821 --> 53:20.823
- What,
be-because of a silly erection?

53:21.115 --> 53:22.833
- Some may find it repulsive.

53:23.117 --> 53:26.212
- But It's just genitals
doing what genitals do.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.247
It's not a big deal.

53:28.539 --> 53:30.416
I mean,
you make it sound so simple.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.868
- What, I... it is, isn't it?

53:32.126 --> 53:33.844
It's not like
they haven't seen one.

53:34.128 --> 53:35.300
A cook's a cock.

53:35.587 --> 53:38.841
They're all...
Basically, pretty similar.

53:39.133 --> 53:41.727
I mean, you can have
a film... Where...

53:42.010 --> 53:45.435
Someone's guts are ripped out
by a knife or an alien

53:45.723 --> 53:48.852
or something
and no one raises an eyebrow.

53:49.143 --> 53:55.867
Or on the news, there's...
Images of... Death and masochism.

53:56.150 --> 54:01.031
That's okay, but... Show everyone
a perfectly healthy erect penis

54:01.321 --> 54:02.868
and they get
all over-the-top excited!

54:03.157 --> 54:06.252
What is with that?

54:06.535 --> 54:09.334
What If you'd come?

54:09.621 --> 54:11.248
Straight into the lens?

54:11.540 --> 54:14.168
Now, that's a film!

54:14.460 --> 54:17.589
- I don't think
that was ever gonna happen.

54:17.880 --> 54:21.100
- If you had good aim,
it'd be a great shot.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.976
Oh!

54:23.260 --> 54:25.058
What If it was in slow-motion?

54:25.345 --> 54:29.316
Like, really slow? Just...

54:34.563 --> 54:35.689
Pbbbth!

54:35.981 --> 54:38.575
All over the lens! Oh!

54:38.859 --> 54:42.033
What If I had an orgasm now?

54:43.906 --> 54:45.783
- Could you?
- Easily.

54:46.074 --> 54:49.328
And they probably wouldn't mind
as much.

54:49.620 --> 54:52.419
Women's orgasms
aren't as much of a show.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.629
You go out, we go in.

54:54.917 --> 54:56.419
So I could just fake it.

54:56.710 --> 54:58.337
But not like in that film.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.973
I'd fake it for real.

55:01.256 --> 55:04.635
You know what I mean.
Might be real, might be fake.

55:04.927 --> 55:07.555
- Ahh.
That'd just confuse the censors.

55:07.846 --> 55:09.189
- Why would they care?

55:09.473 --> 55:11.396
- Well, Real sex

55:11.683 --> 55:14.732
is classified differently
to simulated sex.

55:16.522 --> 55:19.196
You got to be joking.

55:19.483 --> 55:22.407
So, If they actors
do a really good job,

55:22.694 --> 55:24.742
then the film might get banned,

55:25.030 --> 55:27.783
but If they're bad actors
or they do a bad job,

55:28.075 --> 55:29.247
then It's okay?

55:29.535 --> 55:31.833
Yeah, something like that, yeah.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.747
- But in all seriousness,

55:34.039 --> 55:38.135
unless there is a close-up
of a cock in a cunt or a mouth

55:38.418 --> 55:39.510
or an ass or something,

55:39.795 --> 55:41.468
then how can they...
how can they tell?

55:41.755 --> 55:42.972
- They're paid to know.

55:43.257 --> 55:44.977
I hope you're being facetious.

55:45.259 --> 55:46.727
- Mnh.

55:47.010 --> 55:50.981
- What about what we did before?
Is that considered sex?

55:51.265 --> 55:52.482
- No, not in their minds.

55:52.766 --> 55:55.019
- So, they're only worried
about the physical stuff?

55:55.310 --> 55:56.311
- Pretty much.

55:56.603 --> 55:58.243
Um, we're still gonna get
an adult rating.

55:58.438 --> 56:00.987
- Why?
- The "fucks" and "cunts".

56:01.275 --> 56:05.746
- What, but they won't worry
about "penises" and "vaginas"?

56:06.029 --> 56:10.159
- No, not so much.
- What about scrotums?

56:10.450 --> 56:12.544
- You know, I actually don't know
where they fit in.

56:12.828 --> 56:15.001
- Um... Probably down
with the testicles.

56:15.289 --> 56:17.758
- Yeah, huh?

56:18.041 --> 56:20.385
- What If you could smell films?

56:20.669 --> 56:22.467
What would they do then?

56:22.754 --> 56:24.882
I mean, sex and smell.

56:25.173 --> 56:30.270
The actors "simulating" sex,
no actual penetration,

56:30.554 --> 56:37.312
but just... Lots of kissing,
and... Touching, and... Rubbing.

56:37.603 --> 56:39.822
It's still simulated,

56:40.105 --> 56:43.860
but what would happen If they
started getting right into it?

56:44.151 --> 56:46.370
You start to smell it.

56:46.653 --> 56:52.626
And then... It starts wafting
through the air in the cinema,

56:52.910 --> 56:57.211
up into our noses...
Up into their noses.

56:57.497 --> 56:59.499
Can see them getting...
All excited,

56:59.791 --> 57:02.089
trying to figure out
If It's real or not.

57:02.377 --> 57:04.846
- Oh!
- Yeah, that's, uh...

57:05.130 --> 57:07.633
That's, uh, not special effects!

57:07.925 --> 57:09.165
No, that's uh...

57:09.343 --> 57:10.344
That's real.

57:10.636 --> 57:12.104
I can smell vagina...
a mile away.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.942
- So they ban it.

57:17.225 --> 57:19.819
Because It's wet.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.322
- And what about this film?

57:22.606 --> 57:25.029
Does it... Smell wet to you?

57:29.571 --> 57:32.620
- A bit. Not much, not yet.

57:32.908 --> 57:35.252
- Not yet?
- Yeah.

57:35.535 --> 57:37.708
We've still got time.

57:37.996 --> 57:40.749
What are you gonna call it?

57:41.041 --> 57:42.258
- The film?
- Yeah.

57:42.542 --> 57:45.216
"Black and white and sex."

57:48.882 --> 57:51.852
Oh! Oh! She doesn't like it!

57:52.135 --> 57:57.266
- Is it gonna be
in black and white?

57:57.557 --> 57:59.480
Well...

57:59.768 --> 58:02.567
Don't think
Mr. raincoat's gonna like it.

58:02.854 --> 58:04.731
- He's still there, isn't he?

58:08.652 --> 58:13.158
- Yeah.
Not sure he's awake, though.

58:13.448 --> 58:16.247
Hmm.

58:44.813 --> 58:46.736
Mm. He is now. -

58:47.024 --> 58:49.402
Um, anyway,
I think It's a good title.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.205
- I mean, you know, It's sex!

58:53.488 --> 58:55.035
It's... It's something
that everyone has an opinion on,

58:55.323 --> 58:56.620
you know? -

58:56.908 --> 58:58.831
- There are those who believe
that anything goes,

58:59.119 --> 59:01.668
and there are those who believe
that It's just the devil's work.

59:01.955 --> 59:03.502
I mean,
there's no in between with sex.

59:03.790 --> 59:05.167
There...
It's either this or that,

59:05.459 --> 59:07.962
or good or bad, black or white,
you know?

59:08.253 --> 59:10.847
- Can't be.
- Can't be what?

59:11.131 --> 59:14.977
- Devil's work.
It's got to be God's work.

59:15.260 --> 59:19.766
- Why?
- Devil's work divides things.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.185
Heaven and earth. Adam and Eve.

59:22.476 --> 59:24.774
You and I. Us and them.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.986
It's what creates divisions,
conflicts.

59:28.273 --> 59:29.570
God's the opposite.

59:29.858 --> 59:34.580
God is... Everything
that brings things together.

59:34.863 --> 59:37.207
Connects us. Like sex.

59:37.491 --> 59:40.586
That's why It's so compelling.

59:40.869 --> 59:42.621
You with me?

59:42.913 --> 59:47.009
The devil... Is black and white.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.590
God is gray.

59:49.878 --> 59:52.973
Devil is man and woman.
God is sex.

59:53.256 --> 59:56.180
What?

59:56.468 --> 59:58.766
- Oh, I can just see them now.

59:59.054 --> 01:00:00.306
- Who?
- The christians.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:01.598
- What christians?

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:03.608
- The ones
who will be demonstrating

01:00:03.892 --> 01:00:06.941
outside the cinema, waving their
placards, defending their faith.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.277
- Yes, but I wasn't talking
about their God.

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:10.941
I was talking about mine.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:13.110
- And they're different?
- Yeah!

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.950
My God...

01:00:16.238 --> 01:00:17.740
My God is...

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:22.411
A great, big, horny God!

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:25.797
A huge, metaphysical horny.

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:29.381
A giant cock. A massive cunt.

01:00:29.668 --> 01:00:35.300
A big, wet, sticky,
yin-Yang cosmic cuddle.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.012
A fuck to end all fucks.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.928
Big bang was just foreplay.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.394
- Did you know the Vatican
is full of little dicks?

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.277
- Vatican representative
used to go around

01:00:47.561 --> 01:00:49.402
and cut off the dicks
of the old Greek statues,

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.657
but they kept them.

01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:53.408
A weird thing.

01:00:53.692 --> 01:00:59.745
So there's, like, drawers,
just full of little stone dicks.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:02.454
Saw a documentary on it.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:05.165
Dicks of antiquity.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:09.083
I think you should call
your film "Mr. raincoat."

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.297
- Okay, thanks.
I'll think about it.

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:15.465
- Or..." Love and tickle
and happy ending."

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:16.972
- Oh, but, you see,

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.137
we don't know If
It's gonna have a happy ending.

01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:23.601
- That's true.

01:01:26.308 --> 01:01:28.652
- You're like a butterfly,
aren't you'?

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.357
- What do you mean'?

01:01:30.645 --> 01:01:33.649
- You just... You're... Here,
you're there, you're everywhere.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:36.489
- Sorry. It's just me, I guess.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:40.121
- Don't be. I like it.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:43.158
- Do you?

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.248
- Yeah, I do.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:51.341
- Do you like me'?

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.753
- Isn't it obvious?

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:58.140
- Are you trying
to come on to me?

01:01:58.423 --> 01:01:59.424
- Yeah.

01:01:59.716 --> 01:02:02.469
I want to get inside you.

01:02:06.348 --> 01:02:08.521
- What do you think
You'll find in there?

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.401
Huh?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.232
Just hot air, sweetie.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.840
You know those blow-up dolls,
just a surface with orifices?

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.358
- That's me!
- I don't think so.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:19.153
- Mm-hmm. Scratch the surface,
you might get a surprise...

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:21.617
I might blow up in your face!
- Come on, Angie.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:24.533
- What?
Red lips and a shaved pussy?

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:26.201
A tight little anus?

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.040
A thousand fantasies.

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:30.376
I would have thought
that was enough for any man.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:32.758
- Angie, stop talking crap.
- What? What?!

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.839
Oh, what It's all right for you,
isn't it,

01:02:35.126 --> 01:02:37.754
standing there behind your
camera, asking your questions?

01:02:38.046 --> 01:02:39.172
How safe is that?

01:02:39.464 --> 01:02:41.025
- I've got as much at stake here
as you.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.471
- Oh, that is fucking bullshit.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.386
- Well, who was the one over here
masturbating before?

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:45.804
- Well, you know what?

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.313
Apart from me,
no one else could see you.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:48.918
- Angie,
when this film comes out,

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.859
I'm the one who's gonna be
judged... not you.

01:02:50.934 --> 01:02:52.356
- Is that what you think?

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:56.365
Am I just the victim here,
forced to do and say things?

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.275
God, you've got no idea, do you?

01:02:58.566 --> 01:03:00.239
I am fully accountable!

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.279
I know it, they know it!

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.368
Women are always the ones
who are judged...

01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:08.581
especially women like me.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:10.290
You look me in the eye

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:13.923
and you tell me that you see me
like any other person.

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.348
You can't, can you?

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:32.101
That's 'cause you see me
first as a whore,

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:34.065
and then as a person.

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:35.569
They do, too.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.526
We're either whores,
mothers, or lovers.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.820
Then I'm the whore...
isn't that right?

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.489
Course it is.

01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.374
But I'm a lot of other things,
too.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:54.081
I'm good.

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.046
And I'm bad.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:04:02.807
But I'm not black and white.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:04.887
- I'm sorry.

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.598
- You should be.

01:04:10.055 --> 01:04:14.060
- Do you want to stop th...
the interview?

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.730
- Do you?
- No.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:21.321
- You know,
I wasn't bullshitting.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.906
I am like a blow-up doll.

01:04:24.194 --> 01:04:27.038
Inside me, there is hot air.

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:32.670
It's the breath of all the men
who have entered me.

01:04:32.952 --> 01:04:37.674
When they're lying on top of me,
I watch their faces.

01:04:37.957 --> 01:04:44.340
Strangers, with red faces all
puffed up, panting like puppies.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.100
I can feel their breath.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.512
I can smell it.

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:53.103
Can't help but inhale it.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:57.111
When it comes to blowjobs,
I'm it.

01:05:00.772 --> 01:05:02.532
Do you know what
a lot of people don't get...

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.826
what they don't want to get?

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:06.703
It's that I like it.

01:05:06.986 --> 01:05:10.331
I'm not supposed to, but I do.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:16.873
I like to... I like to draw
these guys into me...

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:22.135
Deep inside me,
so they can't escape.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:25.673
It's where I find my strength.

01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:29.184
It's also a weakness.

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:33.347
- I'm trying to understand.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:37.017
- There was this one guy.
He was in his 80s.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:40.232
His wife was dead.
He was on pension.

01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.363
He wanted
to give himself a treat...

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:44.024
a massage with a happy ending.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:45.692
Uh, problem was,

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.064
he didn't think he had
any happy endings left in him,

01:05:48.236 --> 01:05:50.489
so we decided to give him
a double, you know,

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.032
like, full treatment.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.576
Rubbed our breasts all over him,
got right into it.

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:57.747
We only got like $30 cash each.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:00.756
We didn't care.
We got such a buzz.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.840
Especially when he came.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:07.756
He was a dear old chap.
He's probably dead now.

01:06:08.047 --> 01:06:10.175
I was probably
his last happy ending.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:12.390
And we have special moments,
too,

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.805
where we can do a lot of good.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.724
I don't expect you
to understand.

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:20.895
It's who I am.
We're all different.

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:29.327
They say that... Men love
to have sex, but It's not true.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.613
Women love to have sex.

01:06:31.905 --> 01:06:33.578
Men have sex to love.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:36.334
It's the only way they can love.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:40.794
And doing what I do
means that I get to see it more

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.754
than just about anyone.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:49.014
It's not there for very long,
but when it is, It's real.

01:06:49.297 --> 01:06:54.303
Maybe that's why
the wives don't like us.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:58.815
- You know, I'm jealous of you,
your, uh... Courage.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:00.065
Your honesty.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.023
I love
the way your mind works...

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:04.563
the way it just...
Cuts through things.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:07.323
I mean, fuck,
the way you tell it as it is.

01:07:07.607 --> 01:07:08.824
I wish I could do that.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:10.576
- Mm.

01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:13.454
- You know, before, how I said
you were like a butterfly.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:16.662
You... You are.

01:07:16.950 --> 01:07:20.375
But you're also...
You're like a chameleon.

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.960
I never know who I'm gonna get.

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:26.092
And just
when I think I've got you,

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:29.095
you just slip
through my fingers.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:34.306
Makes you kind of...
Unattainable.

01:07:34.592 --> 01:07:38.688
- Moi, unattainable?
- Oui.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:44.270
- Well, honey... All you got to do
is hand over your amex.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.197
Fantasy's extra.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.156
- How much extra?

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:56.994
- Well, that depends
on what you have in mind.

01:07:57.282 --> 01:08:00.286
- What If I wanted to seduce you?

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.298
- Do you?
- It's my fantasy.

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:08.085
- Really?

01:08:08.376 --> 01:08:11.755
And who am I?
- You're a sex worker.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:15.721
- Hmm,
that shouldn't be too difficult.

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:18.103
- But you're off-duty.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:23.734
- Am I? And who are you, then?

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.019
Me.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.359
- Naughty boy.
- Mm.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:33.151
- What would matilda say
about that?

01:08:33.443 --> 01:08:36.868
There is no matilda.

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:39.032
- There's no matilda?

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:42.749
- No.
There was, but... We split up.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.537
- You lied to me!
- No, I didn't.

01:08:44.828 --> 01:08:45.796
- Yes, you did.

01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.127
- No, I didn't!

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.814
I... I never said
I was married now.

01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:51.090
You just assumed that.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:54.301
Fuck. You fuck!

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:57.934
- Well, is there anyone else?
- No.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:00.685
- There's no wifey?
- No.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.813
- Jesus!

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:07.773
Well, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.688
- Yeah.
- What?

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.856
- We have met before.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:16.745
- You know, I thought
your face looked familiar.

01:09:17.028 --> 01:09:19.622
- Mm-hmm. I visited you once.

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:21.283
Long time ago.

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:23.667
- At work?
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.795
- How many times did you see me?

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.174
Just the once.

01:09:29.457 --> 01:09:32.301
Ooh, I must have made
quite an impression.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:33.837
- Yes, you did.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:38.099
- Well, why didn't you come back
and see me again'?

01:09:38.383 --> 01:09:42.934
- I was in a relationship
at the time, and you were, um...

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:47.688
Just a bit too tempting
for safety.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.818
- In what way?

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.401
- I don't remember the details,

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:57.411
but...
I just remember the feeling.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.867
- Did we fuck?
- Yes.

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:02.828
- Did I come?
- I think so.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:07.212
- You telling me the truth?

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:08.462
- Yeah.

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:10.794
- Well,
how did you track me down?

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.131
- Spoke to, uh, Eddie,
at your old place.

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:15.841
- Eddie?
- Mm-hmm.

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:17.730
- Aww, I haven't spoken to Eddie
in ages!

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:19.076
How is he?
- He's good, he's good.

01:10:19.132 --> 01:10:20.349
- Yeah?

01:10:20.633 --> 01:10:22.393
- He said you still have
his "top gun" movie.

01:10:23.928 --> 01:10:27.307
Um, I think it was actually
"top gun" the porn movie.

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:33.188
What do you think they're
gonna think of all of this?

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:35.607
I have no idea.

01:10:35.898 --> 01:10:39.027
They're probably
as confused as I am.

01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:43.073
- I'm sorry <i>I</i>...
<i>I</i> hope <i>I</i> didn't spook you.

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:46.038
- No.
Well, maybe a little bit, but...

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:47.326
It's okay.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:51.043
Think I find it
a little romantic.

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:58.255
Okay.
So... In this fantasy of yours...

01:10:58.546 --> 01:11:00.264
What happens next?

01:11:00.548 --> 01:11:03.142
- Um... I'm not sure. We talk.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:06.100
- You can do better than that.

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:09.482
- You put on a blindfold.

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:13.691
- Do I?

01:11:13.978 --> 01:11:17.528
- Yeah.

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:22.946
- Well, do you have one with you?

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.582
No.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:35.295
- What about this?

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:38.177
Will this do?

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:54.569
How's that?

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:58.277
- Now, what am I gonna do
with you?

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:00.407
Take off your dress.

01:12:00.691 --> 01:12:03.035
- Just like that?

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:06.323
- Yes, just like that.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.161
- Well, don't you...

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:12.374
Wine me and dine me
and give me flowers first?

01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:15.666
- No.
- Not even a kiss?

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:19.678
Well, maybe later, but, um...

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:22.089
Only If you're very good.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.303
- You do remember I'm not
wearing any undies, right?

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:31.063
Yes, yes, I remember.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:37.525
When do I do it?

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:40.611
- Now.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:45.153
- And am I taking off my clothes
because I want to...

01:12:45.444 --> 01:12:49.574
Or because
you're instructing me?

01:12:49.866 --> 01:12:51.288
- Both.

01:12:56.414 --> 01:12:59.293
- Right answer.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:08.930
- And, um... Leave your heels on.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:13.332
Women look so good with just
the heels on, don't you agree?

01:13:27.612 --> 01:13:30.661
So?

01:13:30.948 --> 01:13:32.325
What do you think?

01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.541
- You already know what I think.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:38.502
- I need more than that.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:42.089
- Hey, that's the best compliment
there is.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:45.346
- Finally,
Mr. raincoat has his moment.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:47.382
- Mm. You okay with that?

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:49.471
- Of course.

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:52.182
I like him. He's honest with me.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.360
What now?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.989
- Put your hands
behind your head.

01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:14.784
Now you wait.

01:14:15.076 --> 01:14:16.828
- For what?
- For me.

01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:20.089
- For how long?
- As long as it takes.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:23.001
For what?

01:14:36.806 --> 01:14:39.810
- I'm still here.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.615
Spread your legs.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:56.329
Come on,
you can do better than that.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.416
That's it.

01:15:01.914 --> 01:15:04.258
Touch your nipples.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:09.047
Squeeze them.

01:15:13.509 --> 01:15:15.853
Harder.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.561
Harder.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:32.070
Like that? -

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:39.161
- Are you wet?
- Yes.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:42.547
- Yeah'? I know.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:44.832
- How do you know?

01:15:45.124 --> 01:15:47.172
- I can smell you.

01:15:49.211 --> 01:15:51.760
- Is that a good thing?

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.050
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:15:54.341 --> 01:15:55.763
Definitely.

01:15:56.052 --> 01:16:00.683
- Aren't you worried
about the censors?

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.568
All they can see is nudity.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:06.570
Are they that blind?

01:16:06.854 --> 01:16:08.572
- We are having sex, aren't we?

01:16:08.856 --> 01:16:10.529
- Of course we are.

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:18.954
Thank God.

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:22.871
I'd hate to think
I was on my own.

01:16:23.162 --> 01:16:27.008
- Huh.
It's not just with me, though.

01:16:27.291 --> 01:16:29.464
It's with all of them.

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.219
I hadn't forgotten about them.

01:16:34.507 --> 01:16:38.057
That's what makes this
so exciting.

01:16:38.344 --> 01:16:40.938
- Take off the blindfold.

01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.359
Please.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:04.166
Look at them.

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:10.923
Tell me what you see.

01:17:11.210 --> 01:17:13.133
- My reflection.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:18.016
I meant beyond that.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:24.773
- Well, Mr. raincoat, of course.
- Mm.

01:17:25.057 --> 01:17:29.107
- And some others...
some men and some women.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:31.989
- How does that make you feel?

01:17:33.399 --> 01:17:39.077
- Vulnerable.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.036
- Shy?

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.791
- No.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.748
- Why?

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:47.584
-'Cause I'm in control.

01:17:47.872 --> 01:17:49.966
- How's that?

01:17:50.249 --> 01:17:53.219
- I got the boys by their balls.

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:56.051
Uh-huh.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:58.306
- What about the girls?

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:01.435
- It's a little more complicated.

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:02.766
- Are they envious?

01:18:03.053 --> 01:18:04.475
- Maybe a few.
- Angry?

01:18:04.763 --> 01:18:07.892
- I hope not.
- Some will be.

01:18:08.184 --> 01:18:10.357
- I suppose so.

01:18:10.644 --> 01:18:12.817
- At me or you?

01:18:13.105 --> 01:18:15.107
- I don't know.

01:18:15.399 --> 01:18:17.117
What do you think?

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:19.449
- Don't know.

01:18:19.737 --> 01:18:25.710
I suppose We'll find out
soon enough.

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:29.964
- I suppose so.

01:18:30.247 --> 01:18:33.751
Can I get dressed now'?

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.547
Yes.

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:32.643
You're staring at me.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.312
- Sorry.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:37.106
- I don't mind.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.619
What?

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:52.538
You think this is gonna ruin
my reputation?

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:07.933
- Oh, I needed that.

01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:11.394
I always like one after sex.

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:18.864
I'd like to stop now.
- The interview?

01:20:19.148 --> 01:20:20.365
- Yeah.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:23.118
I don't think
I've got anything else to say.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:25.951
Nothing else I want to say.

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:31.377
- I do.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.958
- What?

01:20:34.246 --> 01:20:38.217
- What?
- I'll tell you later.

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.594
- Will you, now?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.801
- Does life exist
after the credits?

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:44.965
I thought we just went poof!
Poof!

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:47.601
And disappeared into the ether.

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:52.401
Will I be invited
to the premiere?

01:20:52.598 --> 01:20:53.565
- It's your film.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.772
Of course You'll be there.

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:58.483
- On the screen
or in the audience.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.023
- Both.

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.238
- Tell me now.
- What?

01:21:03.525 --> 01:21:07.325
- What you want to tell me later.

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:09.331
Come on.

01:21:09.615 --> 01:21:12.243
Come on.

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.786
Go on.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:18.708
- Mattie was a sex worker.

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:23.637
Matilda?

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:27.471
Matilda's a whore?
- She was... before we met.

01:21:27.758 --> 01:21:30.227
- Fuck! Fuck!

01:21:30.511 --> 01:21:33.014
- Fuck.
- I didn't know.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:36.229
She didn't tell me until
our first wedding anniversary.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:37.939
- Well.

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.572
I suppose
we all have our little secrets.

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:43.072
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

01:21:43.357 --> 01:21:45.906
And when she told you,
uh... How did you take it?

01:21:46.193 --> 01:21:47.285
- Not very well.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.823
- Oh, don't tell me
that's why you left her.

01:21:55.369 --> 01:21:57.212
Aw, you didn't, did you?

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:01.967
You didn't break up with her
because she'd been a hooker?

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.926
So, you didn't love her.

01:22:07.214 --> 01:22:10.343
- I did. More than anything.

01:22:10.634 --> 01:22:12.136
- That's a funny way
of showing it.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.021
- I just felt
that she'd betrayed me.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.476
- Why?

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:18.392
Because she hadn't told you
up front?

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.732
And If she had?

01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:22.566
Would you have dated her?

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:25.278
I mean, would you have fallen
in love with her, married her?

01:22:25.566 --> 01:22:27.864
And then you wonder
why she didn't say anything.

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:31.952
Maybe... maybe she didn't want
to lose you.

01:22:32.239 --> 01:22:37.871
"Till death do us part,
for better or for worse."

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:39.960
She's better off without you.

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:44.093
- Just that when I looked at her,
I didn't see her anymore.

01:22:44.376 --> 01:22:48.051
I...I only saw all the other men
that she'd slept with.

01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:50.761
Look, it wasn't rational, okay?
I wasn't rational.

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:52.926
I... I wasn't thinking
about her or us.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:55.721
I was thinking about...
How I was gonna explain this

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.141
to our friends and colleagues
and my family.

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:01.060
- Oh, who gives a fuck?
- I did.

01:23:01.351 --> 01:23:05.697
At the time, I did.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.983
But then, after she left,
I realized that...

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:10.118
- Too late.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:14.032
You never gave her a chance.
- No, I didn't.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:19.204
Or myself... I never gave myself
a chance to listen to her,

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:24.342
to... To understand.

01:23:24.625 --> 01:23:26.923
- Did you ask her to come back?

01:23:27.211 --> 01:23:30.806
- Every day.
I always got the same response.

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:32.056
- Mm-hmm?

01:23:32.341 --> 01:23:33.513
- Taken her all that time
to trust me,

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.440
and then I just...
Rejected her like that.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:36.644
- Mm.

01:23:36.929 --> 01:23:39.933
Yeah, well, I don't blame her.

01:23:40.224 --> 01:23:42.773
- Know what I said to her?

01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.940
I said I'd forgive her.

01:23:48.524 --> 01:23:51.778
- As If she needed
my forgiveness.

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:57.829
She got remarried
three months ago.

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:04.920
She's pregnant now.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:10.680
- I'm sorry.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.307
Mm, fuck, babe. I'm sorry.

01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:16.013
- It's good to tell someone.

01:24:16.301 --> 01:24:18.554
- You haven't spoken about this
to anyone?

01:24:18.845 --> 01:24:21.314
- Well... It's kind of hard
to know who to tell.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:24.442
And they might react like I did,
and... Let's face it.

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:27.479
There's only one person
that should be judged here.

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:30.274
- It's not mat-fie.
- Eh.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.615
- You know, all I've wanted to do
since she left is just...

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:35.154
Stand on top of a building

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:37.868
and scream out
at the top of my lungs that...

01:24:38.156 --> 01:24:41.626
You know,
"my wife was a whore...

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:43.958
I love her to bits."

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:55.633
- Maybe that's
what you're doing now.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.096
- Hmm.

01:24:57.384 --> 01:25:01.184
- Is that why
you wanted to make this film?

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.520
It is, isn't it?
This is therapy.

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:07.311
- Well, it was mattie
who said I should make a film

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:08.643
about sex and sex workers.

01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:10.375
She said
I might even learn something.

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:13.738
- And have you?

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:17.246
- Yeah. I have.

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:21.370
What's she gonna say
about all this shit

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:23.501
you've been saying about her?

01:25:23.785 --> 01:25:24.877
- I don't know.

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:27.961
I'll speak to her and...
See what she Says.

01:25:28.248 --> 01:25:29.750
If she wants,
I'll... I'll cut it out.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:33.421
- Otherwise, You'll leave it m.
- Mm.

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:38.434
- You're braver than I thought.

01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:44.935
Before,
when you were seducing me,

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:49.353
was that... Was that me,
or was that her?

01:25:49.645 --> 01:25:53.525
- Ironic, isn't it?

01:25:53.815 --> 01:25:58.446
You're the first woman
I've wanted since she left.

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:02.958
- And I'm a hooker.

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:11.835
I don't know what to say.

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:19.179
I don't know what else to say.

01:26:19.466 --> 01:26:21.468
Maybe that's it.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.355
Maybe I should just leave now.

01:26:25.639 --> 01:26:28.313
- Well, It's up to you.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.977
It'll end however you want.

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:33.522
- However I want? Really?

01:26:33.814 --> 01:26:34.815
- Well, then.

01:26:35.107 --> 01:26:37.326
It's got to be something
more dramatic.

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:38.576
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.112
- We should have an argument,

01:26:40.404 --> 01:26:42.532
and I can say, "fuck you,"
and then I'll leave.

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:43.790
Storm off.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:45.274
- Not sure of that.
- Fuck you!

01:26:45.492 --> 01:26:46.664
- Okay.
- No.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:47.919
- No?
- Nah.

01:26:48.203 --> 01:26:49.170
- No?
- Nah.

01:26:49.454 --> 01:26:51.127
- No.

01:26:51.415 --> 01:26:52.758
No, I think you're right.

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:55.009
Well, maybe I could
just look at my watch and say,

01:26:55.293 --> 01:26:58.263
"Oh, that's it.
Time's up. Session's over."

01:26:58.547 --> 01:27:00.470
- Fuck, shower, leave all clean,
eh?

01:27:00.757 --> 01:27:02.009
- I don't need a shower.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.019
I could... Kiss you and say,
"see you tonight."

01:27:05.303 --> 01:27:06.475
- That might work.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.982
In your dreams.

01:27:09.266 --> 01:27:11.234
- If I took a bow...

01:27:11.518 --> 01:27:13.236
And not fall over...

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.988
would I get an applause?

01:27:15.272 --> 01:27:17.872
- Unfortunately, people generally
don't clap at the end of a film.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.447
- Mm, that's a pity.
- Mm-hmm.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:21.576
In that dress, however,
you might get a couple.

01:27:26.283 --> 01:27:29.537
- Well...

01:27:29.828 --> 01:27:31.705
It's been nice knowing you.

01:27:31.997 --> 01:27:33.999
We should do it again sometime.

01:27:36.793 --> 01:27:38.795
Love you.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.840
Especially you, Mr. raincoat!

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:53.276
How much time do we have left?

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.607
- A few minutes.

01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:57.648
- And you're not gonna cut
anything out?

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.909
You're gonna use it
right to the very end?

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.285
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:02.569 --> 01:28:04.446
- You sure? Really?

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:07.617
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:12.914
- Can you get the cameras
to zoom in?

01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:14.331
- Sure.

01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:19.671
- Have you done it?
- Uh, just about.

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.429
Just a minute.

01:28:21.713 --> 01:28:23.306
- Just my face.

01:28:26.426 --> 01:28:29.805
- You can talk.

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.723
- Don't go any wider.

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:33.767
I'm warning you all.

01:29:28.864 --> 01:29:33.165
Cash... Means you get a fuck.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.874
Effort means you might get more.

01:29:43.086 --> 01:29:45.054
This is for you.

01:29:45.338 --> 01:29:48.558
A happy ending.

01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:04.233
Fuck me.

01:30:18.914 --> 01:30:19.961
Oh, fuck.

01:30:31.676 --> 01:30:33.053
Oh, fuck!

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:12.301
