WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:01.980
Previously on "God Friended Me"...

00:02.000 --> 00:03.559
Simon Hayes. Pleasure to meet you, man.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.420
I'm working on something
pretty revolutionary.

00:05.470 --> 00:07.619
Why would Henry run the God Account

00:07.620 --> 00:08.720
through Simon's servers?

00:08.740 --> 00:11.020
Because it's Henry's
way of making a point.

00:11.060 --> 00:12.720
Arthur's tenure here at Harlem Episcopal

00:12.740 --> 00:13.940
might be coming to an end,

00:13.960 --> 00:16.119
and we think you would make
an excellent replacement.

00:16.120 --> 00:17.879
Will you go to dinner with me?

00:17.880 --> 00:18.890
I'd love to.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.940
Wow.

00:24.000 --> 00:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:37.180 --> 00:39.640
You look great, by the way.

00:39.660 --> 00:42.780
Thanks. You too.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.660
It's a nice night.

00:49.380 --> 00:51.020
Yeah.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.720
Uh... you hungry?

00:56.020 --> 00:59.239
I'm sorry, I have no idea
why I just asked that.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.929
No, it's okay.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.479
- And yeah.
- Yeah?

01:02.480 --> 01:03.840
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause I was actually thinking

01:03.850 --> 01:05.539
we could check out that tapas restaurant

01:05.540 --> 01:06.550
you're always talking about.

01:06.570 --> 01:07.769
I love that place.

01:07.770 --> 01:09.639
But I did just go there with Parker.

01:09.640 --> 01:11.160
Oh. Oh, okay.

01:11.200 --> 01:14.219
No, not that you can't have
tapas every night of the week.

01:14.220 --> 01:15.939
Oh, no, no, no, no. That's-that's cool.

01:15.940 --> 01:17.720
- We can go somewhere else.
- No, no.

01:17.740 --> 01:19.110
You know, unless you want
to go somewhere else.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.910
Yeah, um...

01:26.590 --> 01:30.019
Wait, the God Account
just liked Zolfo & Sons.

01:30.020 --> 01:32.859
It's a family-owned Italian
restaurant in the Village.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.219
So now the God Account's

01:34.220 --> 01:35.570
trying to help us pick a restaurant?

01:35.580 --> 01:36.840
I mean, maybe.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.150
Unless it's actually about
a new Friend Suggestion.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.219
Okay, well, why don't
we cross that bridge

01:42.220 --> 01:43.269
when we come to it?

01:43.270 --> 01:44.280
What do you say?

01:44.290 --> 01:45.679
Italian it is.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.590
- Hi.
- Hi. Welcome.

01:52.630 --> 01:54.699
Do you have a reservation
with us this evening?

01:54.700 --> 01:57.840
No, no, but is there any
chance we can get a table?

01:57.850 --> 02:00.560
It's your lucky night. We just
had a cancellation for two.

02:05.110 --> 02:06.180
I got this.

02:06.200 --> 02:09.080
Welcome to Zolfo & Sons.
I'm Sonny Zolfo.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.139
Follow me.

02:10.150 --> 02:12.700
Thanks. Wow, great place, by the way.

02:12.720 --> 02:14.449
Thank you. Thank you very much.

02:14.450 --> 02:16.099
We love it. Young lady.

02:16.100 --> 02:17.240
Thanks.

02:17.250 --> 02:19.339
You're welcome.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.809
This restaurant has been in my family

02:21.810 --> 02:23.230
for three generations.

02:23.340 --> 02:27.349
My grandfather opened those
doors in the late 1930s.

02:27.350 --> 02:29.699
- And the menu's hardly changed.
- Wow.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.620
When you taste the food,
you're gonna know why.

02:33.900 --> 02:36.340
So can I start you off with something?

02:37.060 --> 02:39.480
You want... oh.

02:39.500 --> 02:41.300
Is this a first date?

02:42.560 --> 02:43.959
How can you tell?

02:43.960 --> 02:45.599
Oh, restaurant business.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.740
You develop an eye for
these sort of things.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.220
But I promise, you came
to the right place.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.760
You know what, I'm gonna have the chef

02:50.770 --> 02:53.009
make a special something
for you to start off with

02:53.010 --> 02:54.220
on the house.

02:54.860 --> 02:56.320
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow, thank you.

02:56.380 --> 02:58.120
You're welcome.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.960
This place has a great vibe.

03:01.020 --> 03:03.420
Yeah. I mean, who know
God liked Italian?

03:05.040 --> 03:07.049
So do you think the owner
is our Friend Suggestion?

03:07.050 --> 03:09.220
You know, I was thinking
the exact same thing.

03:11.460 --> 03:13.780
But you know what, let's
not worry about that.

03:13.800 --> 03:14.919
Right. We're off the clock.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.700
Yep.

03:16.720 --> 03:18.360
This place looks good.

03:18.370 --> 03:20.800
Yeah.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.860
Anything catch your eye?

03:23.900 --> 03:26.180
Nope, nothing yet. You?

03:26.230 --> 03:27.240
Nope.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.709
Hi, I'm Sophia.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.520
Sonny told me you guys
were on a first date,

03:37.550 --> 03:38.840
and rather than leave you alone,

03:38.850 --> 03:40.739
I guess he thought it would be nice

03:40.740 --> 03:42.439
to draw unwanted attention to you

03:42.440 --> 03:44.519
by having me bring you this, so...

03:44.520 --> 03:46.479
Well, it looks amazing.

03:46.480 --> 03:48.779
I didn't see anything
like that on the menu.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.299
Eh, yeah, we tend to be
old-school around here.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.739
If it's not covered in cheese
and sauce, it's not Italian.

03:53.740 --> 03:56.579
But I don't know, I thought
you guys might be interested

03:56.580 --> 03:58.220
in something a little different.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.340
So on your right,

03:59.350 --> 04:01.519
you have caramelized
watermelon with fennel

04:01.520 --> 04:03.779
and oregano-infused sweet vinegar.

04:03.780 --> 04:05.840
And on your left, you
have smoked eggplant

04:05.850 --> 04:08.440
with roasted cipollinis and fresh thyme.

04:08.510 --> 04:11.520
All right.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.719
Mmm.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.100
That's amazing.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.899
Yeah, well, I see why you're the chef.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.419
Oh, well, the sous chef
actually, but thank you.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.799
Sophia. Excuse me, folks.

04:25.800 --> 04:29.160
I need you to refry the tartare
di manzo for table 12 please.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.299
Enjoy.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.460
Thank you.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.940
I thought we talked
about off-menu items.

04:37.950 --> 04:40.500
Service isn't the time for your
personal experiments, okay?

04:41.720 --> 04:44.440
Quick. Destroy the evidence.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.219
I just got a Friend Suggestion.

04:50.220 --> 04:51.420
For who?

04:52.290 --> 04:54.250
Sophia Zolfo.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.959
Not only is she the sous chef,

04:55.960 --> 04:57.540
she's also Sonny's daughter.

04:57.550 --> 05:00.339
Well, now we know why the
God Account send us here.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.439
- Synced & corrected by<font color="#E83286"> MementMori </font>-
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.addic7ed.com</font> --

05:07.460 --> 05:09.740
Well, it's nice to see I'm not
the only one working late.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.180
Yeah, just finishing up.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.439
I just wanted to let
you know that my team

05:12.440 --> 05:14.640
from Singular Dynamics is
gonna be here in a few weeks.

05:14.660 --> 05:15.840
So we'll be good to go.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.219
- Great.
- Okay.

05:17.220 --> 05:19.319
Is there anything I can
do before they get here?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.959
You know what? Yeah, actually.

05:22.960 --> 05:25.389
It's something that
requires a certain degree

05:25.390 --> 05:27.180
of discretion, however.

05:28.100 --> 05:29.140
Okay.

05:29.150 --> 05:30.720
So a few months ago,

05:30.740 --> 05:32.980
someone hacked into my
server farm in Palo Alto.

05:32.990 --> 05:35.150
We kicked them off,
but they got back in,

05:35.160 --> 05:36.169
and they keep getting in.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.570
Any idea who this is?

05:37.600 --> 05:39.269
Yeah, it's Henry.

05:39.270 --> 05:41.570
Henry Chase, you know, the
college pal I told you about.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.479
Yeah. Any idea what he's
doing in the system?

05:45.480 --> 05:47.340
He's not doing anything.

05:47.350 --> 05:48.360
Really?

05:48.370 --> 05:50.019
He's just sort of there,

05:50.020 --> 05:51.640
just kinda lurking around.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.219
And you want me to get rid of him?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.919
Your coding reminds me of Henry's.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.859
If anybody can kick him
out and keep him out,

05:56.860 --> 05:58.139
you know, it's you.

05:58.140 --> 06:00.860
I mean, is that something you
think you can do for me?

06:02.230 --> 06:03.819
Sure.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.100
Great.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.929
Great. Thank you.

06:06.930 --> 06:09.140
But I'm gonna need unrestricted access

06:09.160 --> 06:10.169
to the system.

06:10.170 --> 06:11.659
Why would you need that?

06:11.660 --> 06:14.169
Henry's half as good as you say he is,

06:14.170 --> 06:15.880
I'm gonna need every advantage.

06:18.480 --> 06:19.939
Yeah, I mean, if that's
what you think it'll take,

06:19.940 --> 06:21.179
I trust you.

06:21.180 --> 06:23.600
- Okay.
- All right, man.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.989
Whatever Sophia needs help with

06:34.990 --> 06:36.659
can wait till later, right?

06:36.660 --> 06:37.959
- Totally.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.899
It's not like she's going anywhere.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.129
Definitely.

06:50.140 --> 06:51.720
You know, that being said,

06:51.740 --> 06:53.809
it'd be kind of irresponsible
of us not to at least

06:53.810 --> 06:55.240
try and figure out what
she needs help with,

06:55.260 --> 06:57.020
- considering we're here.
- Irresponsible, definitely.

06:57.030 --> 06:58.640
I mean, no reason to be
selfish with our night.

06:58.660 --> 06:59.980
No, that's not us.

07:05.020 --> 07:07.520
Okay, there's not much going
on on her Facebook page.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.420
Yeah, no recent posts.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.859
Although lucky for us,
we know who her dad is.

07:11.860 --> 07:13.170
Hmm.

07:13.220 --> 07:15.329
Oh, excuse me.

07:15.330 --> 07:17.000
You ready to order?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.239
You know, we aren't sure,

07:19.240 --> 07:20.959
but your daughter Sophia,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.900
she made us this amazing amuse-bouche.

07:22.940 --> 07:25.140
Oh, she did, did she?

07:25.160 --> 07:26.909
That's my Sophia.

07:26.910 --> 07:30.619
Let me suggest the Lasagna di Carnevale.

07:30.620 --> 07:33.460
My grandmother brought the
recipe right over from Naples,

07:33.470 --> 07:35.960
and I'm telling you, it's the
best lasagna in the city.

07:37.420 --> 07:39.319
- Hey, Pop.
- Hi, sweetie.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.500
Main rush is over, so Tony
said I could take off.

07:41.510 --> 07:42.740
Great, great, go ahead. Thank you.

07:42.750 --> 07:43.899
And thanks for coming
in on your day off.

07:43.900 --> 07:46.799
Look, I was just telling
this beautiful couple

07:46.800 --> 07:48.369
about our lasagna.

07:48.370 --> 07:49.370
Oh, right, right, right.

07:49.371 --> 07:50.799
His grandmother's recipe,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.899
straight from Naples, best in the city.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.879
Hey, don't knock tradition, all right.

07:54.880 --> 07:55.889
It never gets old.

07:55.890 --> 07:58.339
That's what kept these
doors open for 80 years.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.339
Yes, I know, I know.

08:00.340 --> 08:03.260
But I'm late to meet Angela
in Brooklyn for a drink.

08:03.270 --> 08:04.460
- Love you.
- Love you.

08:05.060 --> 08:06.919
Shoot, you know what.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.249
I left my bag in the back.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.500
You guys enjoy your date.

08:12.400 --> 08:14.780
I'll send over your waiter.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.060
- So do we follow her?
- Definitely.

08:25.700 --> 08:26.819
Yes.

08:26.820 --> 08:28.380
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.

08:28.410 --> 08:30.039
Lester, it's good to see you too.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.879
This is Cara Bloom.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.649
This is Lester, he's the head
of Harlem Episcopal Church.

08:34.650 --> 08:35.940
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

08:35.960 --> 08:38.299
This is Betty Hall from the diocese.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.860
Have you met Reverend Carver?

08:39.880 --> 08:41.119
No, I have not,

08:41.120 --> 08:42.948
but I've heard great
things from my father.

08:42.950 --> 08:43.958
The feeling's certainly mutual.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.789
- Is he here?
- No, just us.

08:45.790 --> 08:47.259
Okay, well, you guys
have a great dinner.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.270
Enjoy yourself.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.069
Wait.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.100
I thought she told her dad
she was going to Brooklyn.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.769
Yeah, but she's not getting on the train

09:01.770 --> 09:02.969
or calling a car.

09:02.970 --> 09:04.180
So where is she going?

09:11.680 --> 09:14.280
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:21.990 --> 09:24.199
- Here, first month's rent.
- Great.

09:24.200 --> 09:27.330
And here are the keys.

09:27.380 --> 09:28.999
Perfect.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.499
Well, that explains why
she lied to her dad

09:31.500 --> 09:33.739
about where she was going.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.180
Yeah, looks like Zolfo & Sons

09:35.200 --> 09:37.620
is about to get some family competition.

09:42.470 --> 09:44.909
If Sophia lied to her dad
about where she was going,

09:44.910 --> 09:46.619
then obviously she
doesn't want to tell him

09:46.620 --> 09:47.739
she's opening up a restaurant.

09:47.740 --> 09:49.630
Yeah, but it's right down the
street from Zolfo & Sons.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.179
It's gonna be kinda hard
to keep it a secret.

09:51.180 --> 09:53.819
Yeah, true. Restaurants
fail to open all the time.

09:53.820 --> 09:55.019
She probably doesn't want to tell him

09:55.020 --> 09:56.519
until she absolutely has to.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.389
You know who I could
ask about this? Parker.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.780
She's "Catapult's" food blogger.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.500
I mean, she knows everyone in town.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.159
Maybe she can find out
how close Sophia is

10:04.160 --> 10:05.540
to actually opening.

10:05.550 --> 10:07.850
- Can I ask you a question?
- Mm-hmm.

10:07.860 --> 10:09.380
Why are you guys here?

10:10.570 --> 10:12.640
Because it's a bar, and
we're having a drink.

10:12.660 --> 10:14.010
Yeah, but it's 9:00.

10:14.020 --> 10:15.219
Aren't you guys supposed
to be on a date?

10:15.220 --> 10:16.519
Right, well, we were,

10:16.520 --> 10:18.759
but then we got a Friend
Suggestion for the sous chef.

10:18.760 --> 10:20.219
Sophia. And we had to follow her.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.260
I mean, we had no other choice.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.460
Yeah, it would have been irresponsible.

10:22.470 --> 10:23.799
Right, and... and selfish.

10:23.800 --> 10:26.260
- Which is not us, so...
- Mm-hmm.

10:27.570 --> 10:28.890
So, Al, how's your new apartment?

10:30.060 --> 10:31.589
What? You have a new place?

10:33.420 --> 10:34.740
Yeah.

10:34.790 --> 10:36.689
I just moved in a few days ago.

10:36.690 --> 10:38.759
I know Miles is gonna be heartbroken

10:38.760 --> 10:40.440
I'm not crashing with him anymore.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.879
I'm actually showing Dad
the place tomorrow.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.729
You know, with Reverend
Carver around now,

10:44.730 --> 10:46.339
Dad can actually get away
every once in a while.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.139
Oh, speaking of, we ran
into him at dinner tonight

10:49.140 --> 10:50.840
with Lester and a woman
from the diocese.

10:50.850 --> 10:53.179
Really? Without Dad?

10:53.180 --> 10:54.860
Yeah, so what?

10:54.880 --> 10:57.819
So you don't think it's odd
that the head of the board

10:57.820 --> 10:59.640
and a member of the
diocese are having dinner

10:59.660 --> 11:01.549
with Dad's assistant priest without him?

11:01.550 --> 11:03.019
I'm sure it's nothing.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.500
Ali, I need a drink, please.

11:08.660 --> 11:10.689
Uh, 'sup, Rakesh?

11:10.690 --> 11:12.500
Seem a little more rattled than usual.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.919
Simon Hayes knows that Henry Chase

11:14.920 --> 11:16.229
is inside his server farm.

11:16.230 --> 11:18.239
- Wait, how do you know?
- He told me.

11:18.240 --> 11:20.069
I thought Henry was
running the God Account

11:20.070 --> 11:22.239
- through the servers.
- Me too, but according to Simon,

11:22.240 --> 11:23.469
he's not running anything.

11:23.470 --> 11:24.539
Do you believe him?

11:24.540 --> 11:26.240
I don't know.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.100
That's what I'm gonna find out.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.780
Simon gave me unrestricted access

11:30.800 --> 11:32.949
to look into it, and once I find Henry

11:32.950 --> 11:34.479
inside the system, I can trace him

11:34.480 --> 11:36.449
and then find out if he's
running the God Account.

11:36.450 --> 11:37.460
And if he's not?

11:38.190 --> 11:39.360
Then it has to be Simon.

11:39.370 --> 11:41.059
Okay, well, Rakesh,
he just promoted you.

11:41.060 --> 11:43.539
If he finds out you've been
sneaking around his system,

11:43.540 --> 11:44.759
he's gonna fire you.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.000
She's right. Look, I want to know

11:46.010 --> 11:48.080
who's behind the God Account
as much as anyone else,

11:48.090 --> 11:50.360
- but you have to be careful.
- I will.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.360
Wait a second, aren't you two

11:56.370 --> 11:58.000
supposed to be out on a big date?

12:07.720 --> 12:09.200
Hey, Dad.

12:09.260 --> 12:11.149
- Hey.
- You ready?

12:11.150 --> 12:12.459
All set.

12:12.460 --> 12:13.640
Can't wait to see your new place.

12:13.660 --> 12:15.780
I have some great decorating ideas.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.029
Do any of them involve
decorating my shelves

12:18.030 --> 12:19.829
with brand-new dishes?

12:21.860 --> 12:23.499
Reverend Finer.

12:23.500 --> 12:24.720
Lester, how are you?

12:25.770 --> 12:28.600
Um... sure.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.120
No, no. No problem at all.

12:32.620 --> 12:35.320
Uh, can you tell me what it's about?

12:35.340 --> 12:37.299
Oh, oh, okay. I'll see you then.

12:37.300 --> 12:39.040
Bye.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.160
Everything okay?

12:41.180 --> 12:42.480
Fine, they just want me to come

12:42.500 --> 12:44.560
to a board meeting tomorrow.

12:45.490 --> 12:47.059
Did Lester say why?

12:47.060 --> 12:50.790
Just said that a few
members of the diocese

12:50.800 --> 12:51.879
will be joining us.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.340
I'm sure it's just housekeeping.

12:54.230 --> 12:57.029
Miles said he ran into
Andrew Carver last night.

12:57.030 --> 12:58.160
- Mm-hmm.
- He was having dinner

12:58.170 --> 13:00.220
with Lester and a member of the diocese.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.960
Do you think something's going on?

13:04.540 --> 13:05.820
Like what?

13:06.880 --> 13:11.180
I don't know, but shouldn't
you be at a dinner like that?

13:11.200 --> 13:14.700
Ali, I'm sure it was just a dinner.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.600
And you really don't have any dishes?

13:25.800 --> 13:28.969
So you and Miles didn't just
have an awkward first date.

13:28.970 --> 13:30.869
You had no date at all.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.499
No, I told you, ye got
a Friend Suggestion.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.169
And honestly, once we
left the restaurant,

13:35.170 --> 13:36.309
it was actually a really fun night.

13:36.310 --> 13:37.969
You mean once you ended the date

13:37.970 --> 13:40.339
and then went back to doing
what you guys always do,

13:40.340 --> 13:41.959
- you had fun.
- I don't get it.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.399
Cara and I have always had
this chemistry between us.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.799
Why do things suddenly change

13:45.800 --> 13:47.260
when you add the word "date" to it?

13:47.270 --> 13:51.080
Because first dates are about
getting to know someone, right?

13:51.110 --> 13:52.699
And you two, you're
already good friends.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.400
It's almost like you've been on
dozens of first dates already.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.330
Think about it, maybe things have always

13:57.340 --> 13:59.300
felt easy with Miles
because you always had

13:59.310 --> 14:00.940
the God Account as a buffer.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.969
You take it away and things get awkward.

14:03.970 --> 14:05.199
Look, Miles, I know you probably

14:05.200 --> 14:06.800
don't want to hear this,
but there is a chance

14:06.810 --> 14:09.069
you guys missed the last
off-ramp to romance

14:09.070 --> 14:12.239
and are about to stay on
the Friendship Freeway.

14:12.240 --> 14:13.460
Forever.

14:14.310 --> 14:17.200
First off, that is a
terrible, terrible analogy.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.649
And secondly, we haven't
missed out on anything.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.279
It was one date, Parker.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.999
I'm sure it will be fine next time.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.040
Can we just move on?

14:24.660 --> 14:27.119
You said you made some calls
about Sophia Zolfo, right?

14:27.120 --> 14:29.929
Not just some calls. A ton of calls.

14:29.930 --> 14:32.429
She definitely is keeping her
new restaurant on the down-low.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.259
But she has a small
investor group lined up.

14:35.260 --> 14:38.099
They haven't written checks yet
but that might change today.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.140
What do you mean?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.039
She's hosting a private lunch for them,

14:41.040 --> 14:42.699
and if it goes well,

14:42.700 --> 14:45.709
my guess is she's in
business soon after.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.960
Thanks.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.699
Well, knowing the God Account,

14:53.700 --> 14:56.279
this isn't about helping Sophia
with an investors' lunch

14:56.280 --> 14:57.499
or her new restaurant.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.519
No, it's about what happens
when her father finds out.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.859
I remember when I recorded
my first podcast.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.060
How excited I was, but
I was also terrified.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.419
Well, I knew that once it got out there,

15:06.420 --> 15:08.459
I woulda had to explain to
my dad what I was doing.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.519
So what happened?

15:09.520 --> 15:11.080
Well, kept putting it off.

15:11.100 --> 15:13.660
He eventually found out through
one of his parishioners.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.280
I bet that didn't go over well.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.309
We stopped talking for six months.

15:17.310 --> 15:19.219
So I understand how Sophia feels.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.419
I mean, it sucks to know
that the one person

15:21.420 --> 15:23.240
that you want approval
from is the same person

15:23.250 --> 15:24.740
who would never understand
what you're trying to do.

15:24.750 --> 15:27.279
You don't understand, I need
to be able to cook here today.

15:27.280 --> 15:28.800
I'm sorry, my hands are tied.

15:28.820 --> 15:30.740
Excuse me, is there
anything we can do to help?

15:30.750 --> 15:33.319
Wait, you two are from the
restaurant last night.

15:33.320 --> 15:35.280
- Yeah, Cara.
- Miles.

15:35.300 --> 15:36.739
What are you doing here?

15:36.740 --> 15:38.080
Well, we actually came to see you.

15:38.090 --> 15:39.819
I work for "Catapult," and
I heard you're trying

15:39.820 --> 15:40.899
to open a new place.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.320
I know you're trying to
fly under the radar,

15:42.350 --> 15:44.229
but I was thinking I
could write an article

15:44.230 --> 15:45.369
whenever you're ready.

15:45.370 --> 15:46.920
I appreciate that.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.419
Unless I can convince
him to turn my gas on,

15:49.420 --> 15:50.760
there won't be a new restaurant.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.779
Look, I told you, we got
a report of a gas leak.

15:52.780 --> 15:54.780
I gotta shut it down
until we can clear it.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.720
Hopefully it'll be back
on by the end of the day.

15:59.820 --> 16:02.659
It took me a year to
line up these investors.

16:02.660 --> 16:03.830
They're gonna be here in three hours,

16:03.840 --> 16:05.020
and I have no place to cook.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.980
Well, have you thought
about talking to your dad?

16:06.990 --> 16:08.520
Maybe you can use his restaurant.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.919
He doesn't understand what I want to do.

16:10.920 --> 16:11.940
He'll never support it.

16:12.090 --> 16:14.099
There's gotta be some way we can help.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.199
I mean, unless you guys know of a place

16:16.200 --> 16:17.699
that'll let me take over its kitchen,

16:17.700 --> 16:19.860
there's nothing to do.

16:23.910 --> 16:26.460
Actually, I may know a place.

16:34.740 --> 16:36.039
Sophia was supposed to cook

16:36.040 --> 16:37.679
for a group of investors this afternoon,

16:37.680 --> 16:39.420
but the space she had fell through.

16:39.440 --> 16:40.580
Yeah, we know it's last-minute,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.110
but is there any way she
could host it here?

16:42.120 --> 16:43.219
Hell yes.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.979
- Really?
- Yes.

16:44.980 --> 16:47.519
Us ladies in the restaurant
game gotta stick together.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.820
Not to mention having a
bunch of rich investors

16:49.880 --> 16:51.789
eating and drinking at Honeysuckle Rose

16:51.790 --> 16:53.380
could only be good for business.

16:53.420 --> 16:54.789
- Thank you so much.
- Of course.

16:54.790 --> 16:56.259
Kitchen's that way.

16:56.260 --> 16:58.029
All right, I'll show you.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.460
You're the best, you know that?

16:59.470 --> 17:01.230
I do. By the way...

17:01.280 --> 17:03.879
- Mm-hmm?
- I was at Dad's office earlier,

17:03.880 --> 17:06.138
and Lester called about
some meeting the diocese

17:06.140 --> 17:07.260
wants to have with him tomorrow.

17:07.270 --> 17:08.439
Did he say what it was about?

17:08.440 --> 17:10.420
No, he downplayed it.

17:10.440 --> 17:13.049
But first, Lester has
dinner with Reverend Carver

17:13.050 --> 17:15.409
and a member of the diocese without Dad,

17:15.410 --> 17:17.319
and now they want to hold a meeting?

17:17.319 --> 17:18.740
Well, if Dad's not concerned,

17:18.750 --> 17:19.759
you shouldn't be concerned either.

17:19.760 --> 17:21.749
When Andrew Carver first got here,

17:21.750 --> 17:23.589
I know Dad was secretly worried.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.888
A young assistant priest
suddenly being assigned

17:25.890 --> 17:27.689
to his church after all these years?

17:27.690 --> 17:28.700
Come on, you do the math.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.699
You think he's trying to replace Dad?

17:32.700 --> 17:34.320
I don't know what I think.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.069
Can you call Rakesh?

17:37.070 --> 17:39.199
Have him do some digging
into Andrew Carver?

17:39.200 --> 17:41.039
- Um...
- Look, believe me,

17:41.040 --> 17:42.500
I want to be wrong about this.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.139
Yeah, but just so you know, I
tried to call him earlier,

17:45.140 --> 17:46.309
and he didn't pick up.

17:46.310 --> 17:47.660
He's searching for Henry Chase,

17:47.670 --> 17:48.900
so you know how he can get.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.419
There's no telling when
he'll come up for air.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.260
- Where are you going?
- The meeting's tomorrow.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.880
I can't wait for Rakesh
to come up for air.

17:58.060 --> 18:01.440
The true judgment of our
character isn't God's alone.

18:01.560 --> 18:04.929
It's in the hearts and the
eyes of our loved ones.

18:04.930 --> 18:07.129
- We...
- Daddy!

18:07.130 --> 18:08.920
Hey, buddy.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.540
I drew a picture of you.

18:12.550 --> 18:14.180
- Wow.
- He had to come show you.

18:15.300 --> 18:17.350
Ah, I love it.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.249
- Andrew.
- Arthur.

18:20.250 --> 18:21.599
You remember Caroline?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.979
Yeah, good to see you again.

18:22.980 --> 18:24.679
This is my son, Marcus.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.539
I remember when my kids
used to run around here.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.419
You know what, Marcus?

18:28.420 --> 18:30.260
There is a balcony up there.

18:30.270 --> 18:33.459
It was my son's favorite spot
to see the whole church from.

18:33.460 --> 18:35.189
Hmm?

18:35.190 --> 18:36.340
Go ahead.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.739
- You have a wonderful family.
- Oh, thank you.

18:43.740 --> 18:45.940
The more time we spend here,
the more it feels like home.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.959
Glad to hear it. Oh, and by the way,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.909
I heard that you ran into
Miles at dinner last night.

18:49.910 --> 18:52.439
Yes, I did, it was great
to finally meet him.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.860
And you were with Lester?

18:53.880 --> 18:55.839
That's right, we were having dinner

18:55.840 --> 18:57.399
- with a member of the diocese.
- Uh-huh.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.899
He thought I should get
to know them better.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.140
Sorry I didn't mention it.

19:00.150 --> 19:02.040
Oh, no problem.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.850
Listen, why don't you get
back to your sermon.

19:14.670 --> 19:16.480
My two new pasta dishes.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.269
Chestnut tortelli with lavender nutmeg,

19:19.270 --> 19:22.339
and pachadi con giardiniera.

19:22.340 --> 19:24.220
Hmm.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.509
Oh, my... this is insanely good.

19:26.510 --> 19:29.109
I mean, the flavors are
like perfectly balanced.

19:29.110 --> 19:32.119
And the presentation is...

19:32.120 --> 19:35.320
Oh, sorry. I watch a lot of "Top Chef."

19:36.360 --> 19:37.700
Where did you learn to cook like this?

19:37.790 --> 19:40.289
- Uh, honestly, my dad.
- Really?

19:40.290 --> 19:42.359
I mean, it doesn't really
look like his kind of food.

19:42.360 --> 19:45.659
No, it's not, but, um, I don't know,

19:45.660 --> 19:47.180
I guess just growing up in restaurants

19:47.200 --> 19:48.659
and being in the kitchen with him,

19:48.660 --> 19:50.669
seeing his love of food and cooking,

19:50.670 --> 19:52.199
it inspired me to become a chef.

19:52.200 --> 19:54.080
Oh, does he know about that?

19:54.090 --> 19:55.239
You should tell him what you're doing.

19:55.240 --> 19:57.299
I will, I just want to
make sure the restaurant

19:57.300 --> 20:00.209
is up and on its feet before
I have that conversation.

20:00.210 --> 20:02.449
Sophia?

20:02.450 --> 20:04.040
Are you here?

20:05.480 --> 20:07.649
I think that's... that's him.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.180
I don't understand.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.760
How did he know I was here?

20:12.800 --> 20:15.160
Sophia?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.480
So it's true?

20:20.460 --> 20:23.239
Did you really think you would
be able to hide this from me?

20:23.240 --> 20:24.940
Dad, I'm sorry. I was gonna tell you.

20:24.950 --> 20:26.120
Tell me what?

20:26.140 --> 20:28.340
Tell me that you were gonna
open your own restaurant?

20:28.350 --> 20:29.920
Or that you're turning
your back on the one

20:29.930 --> 20:32.699
that's been in your family
for three generations?

20:32.700 --> 20:34.460
Turning your back on me?

20:34.470 --> 20:35.479
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:35.480 --> 20:37.040
What about you? I asked you for a chance

20:37.050 --> 20:38.840
to run the kitchen
before you hired Tony.

20:38.850 --> 20:39.860
You wouldn't even give me a chance.

20:39.880 --> 20:41.700
You said you wanted to change the menu.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.780
You wanted to make it
something that it wasn't.

20:43.800 --> 20:46.389
No, I wanted to show
you what I could do.

20:46.390 --> 20:48.799
And yeah, maybe bring something
special to the restaurant.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.519
The restaurant has always
been special, Sophia.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.340
That's the problem. You
could never see that.

20:53.350 --> 20:56.300
No, you never saw me as a real chef,

20:56.320 --> 20:58.140
which is a shame because when I open up

20:58.150 --> 21:00.280
my own spot, the rest of
the city will see that,

21:00.300 --> 21:01.420
and maybe you will too.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.979
It takes more than creating new dishes

21:03.980 --> 21:06.039
to run a new restaurant, sweetie.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.520
Look, there's pitfalls
you're just not ready for.

21:09.380 --> 21:11.240
We done here?

21:11.250 --> 21:13.249
'Cause I'm expecting investors soon,

21:13.250 --> 21:14.410
and I gotta get back to work.

21:15.260 --> 21:16.820
I guess we are.

21:26.530 --> 21:28.780
Sophia, I'm so sorry.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.100
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

21:32.220 --> 21:35.209
Look, I know what it's like
to have a blowout like that

21:35.210 --> 21:37.560
with your dad, for him not to understand

21:37.570 --> 21:41.040
what you're trying to do,
but trust me, he will.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.920
But you have to keep going.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.460
And I know right now you may feel alone,

21:46.470 --> 21:48.620
but you're not.

21:48.660 --> 21:49.860
We're here.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.260
He's right.

21:52.280 --> 21:55.280
You can do this, and we're
gonna make sure of it.

21:57.360 --> 21:59.140
Thanks.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.119
Rakesh.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.320
Ali, what... what are you doing here?

22:04.340 --> 22:05.640
Sorry to invade your workspace,

22:05.650 --> 22:07.000
but Miles told me you were in the zone

22:07.010 --> 22:08.280
and might not be returning calls.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.899
Yeah, I'm kind of in the thick of it.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.600
I'm trying to track Henry
through the servers.

22:11.610 --> 22:13.040
Okay, then I'll make it quick.

22:13.050 --> 22:14.549
Look, I think the church might be trying

22:14.550 --> 22:15.760
to have my dad replaced.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.300
Yeah, is there any way you can look into

22:18.320 --> 22:20.340
his assistant priest, Andrew Carver?

22:20.350 --> 22:21.740
Yeah, yeah, shouldn't be a problem.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.259
Thank you.

22:24.590 --> 22:26.389
Wait, this can't be right.

22:26.390 --> 22:28.389
What is it?

22:28.390 --> 22:29.860
Henry's not running code,

22:29.880 --> 22:31.840
but he's not just lurking around either.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.100
I think he's trying to gain access

22:33.110 --> 22:35.369
into a specific server in the cluster.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.620
_

22:37.700 --> 22:39.669
Wait a minute, I thought
you had some sort

22:39.670 --> 22:41.140
of unrestricted access to everything.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.439
So did I.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.709
I mean, this has to be where Simon Hayes

22:44.710 --> 22:46.120
parked the top-secret project.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.419
Wait, what is Henry doing?

22:50.420 --> 22:52.420
_

22:53.740 --> 22:56.840
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.289
- I need to talk to Simon.
- Okay.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.759
Um, I'll look into your
priest as soon as I can.

23:00.760 --> 23:02.189
No problem.

23:04.160 --> 23:05.480
Simon.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.520
Simon? We have a big problem.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.679
Okay.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.219
All right, Henry, if this
is how you want to play it,

23:27.220 --> 23:29.380
you leave me no choice.

23:32.070 --> 23:35.229
Let's see how you like
hypertext transfer protocol

23:35.230 --> 23:38.260
application layer filtering
frozen system-wide,

23:38.270 --> 23:40.840
mandatory access control to
slow down input packets.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.499
Rakesh, what the hell are you doing?

23:45.500 --> 23:47.139
- Not now.
- Get the hell away

23:47.140 --> 23:49.140
from my computer, or
I'm calling security.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.840
I don't think you want me to do that.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.079
Henry's trying to break
into my private server.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.699
No, I think he knows he can't break in.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.589
- But what he can do is...
- Launch a virus.

24:00.590 --> 24:01.719
Take down the entire system.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.459
Yeah, and destroy your
top-secret project

24:03.460 --> 24:04.640
right along with it.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.099
I think he realized I was tracking him

24:06.100 --> 24:07.759
inside the server and decided to attack.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.770
I just need to sandbox
your private server so...

24:09.780 --> 24:11.929
Right, right, take the
entire system offline.

24:11.930 --> 24:13.040
Good, genius.

24:15.100 --> 24:16.140
_

24:21.700 --> 24:23.820
I think we need to talk.

24:31.450 --> 24:32.979
Sophia looks like the real deal.

24:32.980 --> 24:34.100
Yeah.

24:34.110 --> 24:35.680
You know, after what happened
with her and her father,

24:35.690 --> 24:36.860
I really hope this works out.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.299
Look, that's for covering this, Parker.

24:38.300 --> 24:41.630
Hopefully some good press will
go a long way for her place.

24:41.640 --> 24:42.650
Yeah, no problem.

24:42.660 --> 24:44.580
Thanks.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.980
All right, last dish has been served.

24:47.990 --> 24:51.120
All right, looks like you
got some happy investors.

24:52.570 --> 24:53.609
Sophia.

24:53.610 --> 24:55.239
Will, thank you so much for coming.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.920
The food was excellent.

24:56.980 --> 25:00.160
So why do I feel like
you've got bad news?

25:00.180 --> 25:01.679
That was my assistant on the phone.

25:01.680 --> 25:04.740
Your liquor license didn't go through.

25:06.320 --> 25:07.919
I filed all the paperwork myself.

25:07.920 --> 25:09.289
I mean, there must be some mistake.

25:09.290 --> 25:10.780
If there was, it was on your end.

25:10.790 --> 25:12.720
Will, just let me figure this out.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.229
Whatever it is, I can fix it.

25:14.230 --> 25:16.659
Sophia, we took a risk
when no one else would,

25:16.660 --> 25:19.080
but a mistake like this
raises serious concerns

25:19.100 --> 25:21.099
about your ability to run a restaurant.

25:21.100 --> 25:23.269
You are clearly a talented chef,

25:23.270 --> 25:26.569
but, I'm sorry, we have to pass.

25:35.980 --> 25:37.349
This makes no sense.

25:37.350 --> 25:39.259
I mean, I went over every
permit a dozen times,

25:39.260 --> 25:41.529
especially the liquor license.

25:41.530 --> 25:44.110
Al, do you know anyone on the
liquor board you could talk to?

25:44.120 --> 25:45.399
Maybe there's something we could do.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.200
Yeah, actually I do. I
know someone over there.

25:47.290 --> 25:48.759
I'm happy to give them a call.

25:48.760 --> 25:50.180
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

25:50.200 --> 25:51.829
But even if we get
this straightened out,

25:51.830 --> 25:52.959
I mean, I have no investors.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.540
Well, then we'll find new ones.

25:54.550 --> 25:56.700
I sunk everything I had
into the first month's rent

25:56.710 --> 25:57.719
to hold the space.

25:57.720 --> 25:59.799
If I lose it, I have to start all over.

25:59.800 --> 26:02.939
I can't believe my father might
actually have been right.

26:02.940 --> 26:04.939
No, no, he wasn't.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.260
Okay, you can't give up.

26:08.340 --> 26:09.939
You're right.

26:09.940 --> 26:11.740
You know what, I'm gonna
go back to my restaurant,

26:11.750 --> 26:13.199
and I'm gonna make some phone calls.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.400
There's gotta be somebody out there

26:14.410 --> 26:15.830
that's willing to take a chance on me.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.100
I'll be in touch.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.040
Thanks.

26:21.590 --> 26:23.859
Okay, I'm gonna call my
friend on the liquor board.

26:23.860 --> 26:25.120
What's your next step?

26:27.550 --> 26:30.079
- _
- Maybe the God Account just sent us one.

26:30.080 --> 26:33.579
Ladurée Macaroons in SoHo?

26:33.580 --> 26:36.380
Well, I love that place.
Let's go check it out.

26:38.300 --> 26:39.879
I don't understand.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.840
Why would Henry want
to destroy your work?

26:43.290 --> 26:46.659
You ever hear of, uh, J.J. Thomson?

26:46.660 --> 26:49.120
No. Why?

26:49.230 --> 26:53.600
He's credited with
discovering the electron.

26:53.620 --> 26:56.839
His breakthrough changed
the course of history,

26:56.840 --> 26:59.220
but it was Thomas Edison who ushered us

26:59.240 --> 27:00.760
into the modern age of electronics,

27:00.770 --> 27:03.149
who saw the potential to light the world

27:03.150 --> 27:07.449
in a way that Thomson just never could.

27:07.450 --> 27:10.659
And in this story,

27:10.660 --> 27:14.029
you're Edison and Henry's Thomson?

27:14.030 --> 27:17.559
Look, Henry is the brightest
mind I've ever known,

27:17.560 --> 27:19.499
capable of changing the world,

27:19.500 --> 27:21.899
but like most geniuses he
fell in love with creation.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.329
Not application.

27:23.330 --> 27:25.899
I saw the potential in
predictive analytics,

27:25.900 --> 27:28.669
but our initial algorithms
barely scratched the surface.

27:28.670 --> 27:30.309
In order to reach its true potential,

27:30.310 --> 27:33.139
we needed to hire coders and
build an infrastructure.

27:33.140 --> 27:34.809
You needed to create Singular Dynamics.

27:34.810 --> 27:38.679
Yes, in order to ensure that
our vision was protected.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.619
And Henry thought you were selling out.

27:40.620 --> 27:42.519
I mean, in Henry's mind,

27:42.520 --> 27:45.819
I was... I was somehow betraying
everything we set out to do.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.920
You know, he vowed never
to work with me again,

27:47.930 --> 27:50.300
and then he just disappeared.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.040
That was ten years ago.

27:54.470 --> 27:57.999
You know, when, um...

27:58.000 --> 28:00.239
when Henry left, I... yeah, I just...

28:00.240 --> 28:01.709
I didn't just lose a partner.

28:01.710 --> 28:03.900
I lost my best friend.

28:04.780 --> 28:08.160
So why come back to sabotage you now?

28:09.840 --> 28:13.579
Because I'm on the verge
of changing the world

28:13.580 --> 28:16.289
in a way that he never could,

28:16.290 --> 28:19.319
and he can't face it.

28:19.320 --> 28:20.829
He can't admit the fact

28:20.830 --> 28:22.629
that I'm about to fulfill the dream

28:22.630 --> 28:24.459
that he walked away from,

28:24.460 --> 28:26.140
so he'd rather destroy it.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.640
And I need you to help me
prevent that from happening.

28:31.980 --> 28:34.500
Can I count on you?

28:46.020 --> 28:47.199
Yeah, it's so crazy.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.300
I was just craving
Ladurée the other day.

28:49.310 --> 28:51.320
Oh, why does that not surprise me?

28:51.390 --> 28:53.419
Well, not just because I love macaroons,

28:53.420 --> 28:55.659
which I do, but I like to come here

28:55.660 --> 28:56.889
when I'm feeling nostalgic.

28:56.890 --> 28:58.329
For what?

28:58.330 --> 29:01.440
Oh, in college, I studied
abroad in Paris.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.969
It was my first time out of the country.

29:03.970 --> 29:05.439
I was 4,000 miles away,

29:05.440 --> 29:07.039
and yet I never felt more at home.

29:07.040 --> 29:09.809
On Sundays, I would grab
a coffee and a macaroon

29:09.810 --> 29:11.639
and stroll down the Champs-Élysées

29:11.640 --> 29:12.760
to the Arc de Triomphe.

29:12.800 --> 29:14.460
It was the best time of my life.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.880
You know, it's a dream of mine
to move to Paris one day.

29:19.980 --> 29:22.520
Okay, you have never told me this.

29:22.550 --> 29:24.919
See, why couldn't we talk
about stuff like this

29:24.920 --> 29:26.800
on our date last night?

29:27.490 --> 29:29.429
I don't know.

29:29.430 --> 29:30.899
What happened?

29:30.900 --> 29:32.640
I have no idea.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.100
I guess we just weren't being ourselves.

29:37.540 --> 29:38.620
Yeah.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.660
Wait.

29:44.260 --> 29:47.579
Hey, isn't that the guy
from the gas company?

29:47.580 --> 29:50.240
Yeah. Wait, that can't be a coincidence.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.400
Hey, uh, excuse me, excuse me.

29:51.410 --> 29:54.119
Do you remember us from
our friend's restaurant?

29:54.120 --> 29:55.320
Oh, yeah, that's right.

29:55.330 --> 29:57.889
Hey, did your friend ever find
a place to cook her lunch?

29:57.890 --> 30:00.019
- She did.
- Oh, that's great.

30:00.020 --> 30:02.159
I'm glad it worked out.
You know, I felt bad,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.400
especially when I found out
that there was no gas leak.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.260
What do you mean?

30:06.270 --> 30:08.729
Yeah, somebody called in
claiming they smelled gas,

30:08.730 --> 30:10.939
so we had to shut it down,
but it all checked out.

30:10.940 --> 30:12.660
Any idea who made the call?

30:12.670 --> 30:14.340
Nah, it was an anonymous tip.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.000
Have a good one.

30:17.740 --> 30:19.819
Wait, so someone makes an anonymous call

30:19.820 --> 30:21.100
to get her gas turned off,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.709
and then the paperwork for her
liquor license falls through?

30:23.710 --> 30:25.949
Miles, what if that's why the
God Account send us here,

30:25.950 --> 30:27.789
because someone's sabotaging her?

30:27.790 --> 30:29.819
Maybe that someone feels betrayed

30:29.820 --> 30:31.520
she's leaving the family business.

30:31.580 --> 30:32.860
What, Sonny?

30:32.920 --> 30:34.659
You think her own father
would do that to her?

30:34.660 --> 30:36.219
I don't know, but if he did

30:36.220 --> 30:37.859
and Sophia finds out,

30:37.860 --> 30:40.260
that could end their
relationship for good.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.099
- I was thinking about it.
- What's the name?

30:44.100 --> 30:45.940
- Uh...
- Hey, we need to talk.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.469
You two again?

30:47.470 --> 30:48.700
Look, if this is about my daughter,

30:48.710 --> 30:49.839
there's nothing to talk about.

30:49.840 --> 30:51.339
Actually, there is.

30:51.340 --> 30:53.840
Someone had Sophia's
liquor license pulled

30:53.850 --> 30:55.949
so she wasn't able to
open up her restaurant.

30:55.950 --> 30:57.240
You think I had something to do

30:57.250 --> 30:58.480
with her license being pulled?

30:58.500 --> 31:00.279
We did.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.489
But then my sister talked to her
friend on the liquor board,

31:02.490 --> 31:04.320
and it turns out it wasn't you.

31:04.540 --> 31:05.900
It was him.

31:07.290 --> 31:08.480
What?

31:09.460 --> 31:12.359
Sonny, I... I don't know
what they're talking about.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.099
How did you find out Sophia was cooking

31:14.100 --> 31:15.200
at my sister's restaurant?

31:15.210 --> 31:18.139
My guess is he told you.

31:18.140 --> 31:21.160
Yeah, that's right, that's right.

31:23.500 --> 31:24.720
Tony?

31:30.040 --> 31:32.349
Okay, fine, I know the woman
she signed a lease with,

31:32.350 --> 31:34.590
and when I found out, I had
her liquor license held up.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.380
Why the hell did you do that?

31:37.020 --> 31:39.390
You don't get it, Sonny. You never have.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.289
- Don't get what?
- How talented she is.

31:42.290 --> 31:43.719
You just see her as your little girl,

31:43.720 --> 31:46.570
but if her restaurant turns
out half as good as she is,

31:46.580 --> 31:47.899
it'll cripple us.

31:47.900 --> 31:51.599
I wasn't gonna just sit
back and let it happen.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.760
It was business. It wasn't personal.

31:53.800 --> 31:56.509
It wasn't personal? Wasn't personal?

31:56.510 --> 31:59.080
This business has always been personal.

31:59.100 --> 32:01.200
It's about my family.

32:02.610 --> 32:04.549
And I just turned my back on her.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.079
Look, this isn't gonna happen again.

32:06.080 --> 32:07.920
- Tony, you're fired.
- Sonny...

32:07.930 --> 32:09.140
We're done here.

32:20.300 --> 32:22.229
I have to find my daughter.

32:22.230 --> 32:23.899
I have to figure out a
way to make this right.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.680
Actually, I think we can help with that.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.579
Rakesh, how'd things go with Simon?

32:33.580 --> 32:34.879
Fine, but listen,

32:34.880 --> 32:36.960
finally got to dig into
Andrew Carver for you.

32:36.980 --> 32:38.220
Did you find anything?

32:38.240 --> 32:40.349
Uh, you could say that, yeah.

32:40.350 --> 32:42.959
I found an email from the
board of Harlem Episcopal

32:42.960 --> 32:46.359
to the New York Diocese,
and it turns out

32:46.360 --> 32:48.250
Andrew Carver wasn't
assigned to the church

32:48.260 --> 32:49.459
like they told your dad.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.629
The board requested him.

32:51.630 --> 32:52.900
They lied.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.769
I think you were right, Ali. Um...

32:55.770 --> 32:57.280
They're replacing your dad.

33:03.730 --> 33:06.139
I can't believe Tony would
sabotage me like that.

33:06.140 --> 33:08.369
He told your dad that he had to.

33:08.370 --> 33:09.680
That he knew how talented you were,

33:09.700 --> 33:11.069
even if Sonny couldn't see it.

33:11.070 --> 33:12.920
He said that?

33:13.000 --> 33:15.460
He did. Right before your dad fired him.

33:16.510 --> 33:19.220
Well, it's too bad the
damage is done, right?

33:19.240 --> 33:20.379
Then undo it.

33:20.380 --> 33:22.719
My sister's friend on the liquor board

33:22.720 --> 33:25.140
is putting your license
through as we speak.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.780
That's amazing.

33:27.510 --> 33:30.079
But, I mean, for the past 24 hours,

33:30.080 --> 33:32.539
I've been on the phone begging
everyone I know to invest,

33:32.540 --> 33:33.980
and no one will take a chance on me.

33:34.660 --> 33:38.219
Actually, there is one person.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.480
Dad?

33:45.790 --> 33:48.040
Hello, sweetheart.

33:48.740 --> 33:52.580
I thought I'd come down and
take a look at your new place.

33:52.670 --> 33:55.199
Yeah, well, not for much longer.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.100
I know that.

33:57.170 --> 33:59.000
So then what are you doing here?

34:00.700 --> 34:04.339
Well, remember when you were growing up,

34:04.340 --> 34:06.020
we had that little stepladder

34:06.030 --> 34:08.279
in the kitchen of the restaurant.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.120
You'd use it to get to the pasta maker

34:10.139 --> 34:12.489
'cause you used to like to
crank the roller, remember?

34:12.489 --> 34:14.589
Yeah, and you used to quiz me

34:14.590 --> 34:17.219
on the thickness of the different pastas

34:17.219 --> 34:18.688
as you pushed the dough through.

34:18.690 --> 34:20.420
That's right.

34:21.389 --> 34:25.668
Well, I just realized that, um,

34:25.670 --> 34:28.219
I never let you off that little ladder,

34:29.320 --> 34:31.219
and I am so, so sorry

34:31.219 --> 34:34.639
that I couldn't see you
for the amazing chef

34:34.639 --> 34:36.819
that you truly are, and I know...

34:36.820 --> 34:38.958
I know I'm stuck in the past,

34:38.960 --> 34:42.149
but that's why we have kids.

34:42.150 --> 34:44.900
So they... they pull us into the future.

34:47.350 --> 34:49.199
So what do you say?

34:50.500 --> 34:53.789
Look, Dad, I do not want to
be a chef at Zolfo & Sons.

34:53.790 --> 34:56.498
I'm sorry, that is...

34:56.500 --> 34:58.200
it's just not me.

34:59.200 --> 35:01.380
I know that.

35:02.370 --> 35:04.340
That's why I'm selling the restaurant.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.000
- What?
- Don't worry, your mother's been

35:06.010 --> 35:07.769
begging me to retire anyway.

35:07.770 --> 35:09.460
What are you talking about?

35:09.580 --> 35:13.480
I want you to use the money
to open your own place.

35:13.550 --> 35:17.080
Think of me as your angel investor.

35:18.720 --> 35:20.750
I can't believe you did that.

35:20.760 --> 35:22.619
Dad, that restaurant
means everything to you.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.180
No, sweetie, no.

35:25.200 --> 35:26.720
You are everything to me.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.300
I just needed a good kick in
the ass to remember that.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.760
I love you.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.680
Hey, hey, you two.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.240
We're having a celebration tomorrow.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.080
I expect you're both
gonna be there, okay?

35:45.150 --> 35:46.820
Absolutely.

35:46.850 --> 35:48.940
Thank you both for everything.

35:55.260 --> 35:58.100
Hey. Hey, Ali, what's up?

36:03.660 --> 36:05.399
I'm so sorry I didn't
listen to you earlier.

36:05.400 --> 36:07.290
It's okay, all that
matters is we tell Dad

36:07.300 --> 36:08.329
before he's blindsided.

36:08.330 --> 36:10.299
Ali, Miles,

36:10.300 --> 36:12.209
can I help you?

36:12.210 --> 36:13.909
Is something wrong?

36:13.910 --> 36:16.379
We know you're trying to take
Harlem Episcopal from our dad.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.580
I don't know what you heard, but
this is not what you think.

36:18.600 --> 36:20.049
Okay, then explain it to us.

36:20.050 --> 36:21.749
Miles,

36:21.750 --> 36:23.240
Ali, what are you doing here?

36:24.280 --> 36:26.440
I think you need to ask
Reverend Carver about that.

36:28.560 --> 36:29.960
Andrew?

36:30.060 --> 36:31.989
I haven't been totally honest

36:31.990 --> 36:33.659
about my reasons for being here.

36:33.660 --> 36:36.929
Lester and the board requested
that I come to Harlem Episcopal

36:36.930 --> 36:40.960
to... replace you as head priest.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.969
I'm, uh...

36:44.970 --> 36:46.639
I'm being pushed out, is that it?

36:46.640 --> 36:48.339
No, of course not.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.239
The diocese holds you
in the highest regard.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.839
I don't understand.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.539
Arthur, they're nominating you

36:54.540 --> 36:56.560
to become Bishop of New York.

36:59.890 --> 37:03.180
Whoa, so... so that's what
the board meeting's about?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.570
Yes, discussing the next steps

37:05.580 --> 37:06.959
in your father's transition.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.120
Wait, Dad, that is great.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.299
I don't know what to say.

37:11.300 --> 37:12.980
I mean, why all the intrigue?

37:12.990 --> 37:15.380
Why not just tell me the
truth from the beginning?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.180
The board knows how deeply you care

37:17.200 --> 37:19.869
about Harlem Episcopal,
that you'd be unwilling

37:19.870 --> 37:21.120
to leave it in someone else's hands

37:21.140 --> 37:22.639
unless you felt comfortable
with that person.

37:22.640 --> 37:24.540
And that's why you're here,

37:24.550 --> 37:26.509
gave me the chance to get to know you.

37:26.510 --> 37:28.549
And hopefully show you that this church,

37:28.550 --> 37:31.219
your church, is in good hands

37:31.220 --> 37:32.860
if you decide to move on.

37:32.950 --> 37:34.880
I'm sorry you had to find out like this,

37:34.890 --> 37:37.620
but your children are obviously
very protective of you.

37:37.630 --> 37:39.829
Damn straight, we are.

37:39.830 --> 37:40.880
Get over here, Dad.

37:42.530 --> 37:44.329
Ohh.

37:46.470 --> 37:48.920
It's easy to think of new beginnings

37:48.930 --> 37:51.640
as something that just happens
when the time is right.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.940
Life's way of wiping the slate clean

37:54.960 --> 37:57.360
to allow us to change course.

37:57.370 --> 38:00.549
But the truth is, new
beginnings are never easy.

38:00.550 --> 38:03.419
They usually remind us
of where we've been

38:03.420 --> 38:05.599
as much as where we're headed,

38:05.600 --> 38:09.319
what we have to sacrifice
and leave behind

38:09.320 --> 38:11.600
if we choose to continue on.

38:12.820 --> 38:15.219
Hey, I just wanted to let you know

38:15.220 --> 38:16.620
that your servers are back online.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.860
You won't have to worry about
Henry poking around anymore.

38:19.970 --> 38:22.599
Okay. Thank you, man.

38:22.600 --> 38:23.620
Yeah.

38:29.440 --> 38:33.379
I think we can officially take
Henry Chase off the table.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.149
Simon Hayes is our main suspect now.

38:35.150 --> 38:36.879
So you really think the
top-secret project

38:36.880 --> 38:38.419
he's been working on is the God Account?

38:38.420 --> 38:39.700
What else could it be?

38:40.390 --> 38:42.219
Well, we could just wait
for his team to get here,

38:42.220 --> 38:44.219
hope they show you the
account when he's ready.

38:44.220 --> 38:46.140
No, I'm not sure he's going to,

38:46.230 --> 38:48.340
not unless we force his hand.

38:48.350 --> 38:49.640
Well, how do we force it?

38:49.680 --> 38:52.060
You've said it from
the beginning, Miles.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.720
You weren't chosen at random.

38:53.740 --> 38:55.939
Just need to find the
connection between you

38:55.940 --> 38:57.540
and Simon Hayes.

38:59.260 --> 39:01.020
And is there a point in the journey

39:01.040 --> 39:03.020
where it's simply too
late to change course

39:03.030 --> 39:04.099
even if you wanted to?

39:04.100 --> 39:06.660
_

39:09.720 --> 39:12.640
Hey, what are you up to?

39:12.740 --> 39:15.700
Just sitting here. You?

39:15.820 --> 39:18.720
Actually, I could use some advice.

39:20.830 --> 39:21.940
What's on your mind?

39:24.130 --> 39:26.840
- It's about me and Cara.
- Mm-hmm.

39:26.850 --> 39:30.360
We have always had this great chemistry,

39:30.440 --> 39:33.439
but when we went on a
date, it just vanished.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.820
- Uh-huh.
- And I'm not sure why.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.520
Well, you know, in my experience,

39:37.530 --> 39:41.520
there's a difference between
chemistry and spark.

39:42.820 --> 39:44.830
Chemistry is that easy feeling
you have with someone

39:44.840 --> 39:46.319
that grows over time.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.519
Spark...

39:48.520 --> 39:50.960
Spark you just have.

39:51.020 --> 39:53.540
It takes over on its own.

39:54.180 --> 39:55.659
And if it doesn't?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.520
Then it never will.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.939
In the end, maybe
trying to change course

40:04.940 --> 40:08.420
is more about realizing
you never needed to,

40:08.440 --> 40:09.639
and that's okay.

40:09.640 --> 40:12.410
I am so glad everything
worked out for Sophia.

40:12.420 --> 40:14.180
Yeah, me too.

40:14.220 --> 40:15.579
I mean, after her investors left,

40:15.580 --> 40:18.179
I thought she might
have missed her window.

40:18.180 --> 40:21.989
Hey, do you think that's
what happened to us?

40:21.990 --> 40:24.000
Like we missed our window?

40:25.420 --> 40:29.240
I don't know, maybe, but...

40:29.430 --> 40:31.999
you know, if we did, I'm okay with it.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.740
You are?

40:33.770 --> 40:35.369
Well...

40:35.370 --> 40:38.190
I just mean having you
come into my life,

40:38.200 --> 40:40.109
having you as a friend,

40:40.110 --> 40:41.330
it's like one of the best things

40:41.340 --> 40:43.020
that's ever happened to me.

40:43.710 --> 40:45.460
I wouldn't want to change any of it.

40:49.850 --> 40:51.700
Neither would I.

40:52.590 --> 40:54.449
So...

40:54.450 --> 40:55.860
friends?

40:57.260 --> 40:58.640
Friends.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.680
- Hey.
- Hey.

41:09.770 --> 41:12.309
So glad you guys could make it.

41:12.310 --> 41:14.269
Oh, my God, of course.
We would not miss this.

41:14.270 --> 41:17.439
- You ready to make your mark?
- Absolutely.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.500
Excuse me, please.

41:18.510 --> 41:19.879
Can I have your attention for a second?

41:19.880 --> 41:21.200
Thank you, thank you.

41:21.220 --> 41:23.379
First of all, thank you all for coming.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.719
And on behalf of the Zolfo family,

41:25.720 --> 41:28.380
I would like to invite you
to our newest venture,

41:28.400 --> 41:30.589
and it's gonna be open
in about six months,

41:30.590 --> 41:33.729
and it's gonna be an amazing
Italian restaurant,

41:33.730 --> 41:36.099
and I know the whole town's
gonna be buzzing about it.

41:36.100 --> 41:39.499
And it's going to be called Sophia's.

41:44.470 --> 41:45.669
Cheers.

41:45.670 --> 41:48.300
Please, everybody stand up, stand up.

41:48.310 --> 41:51.339
As you know, we have this
tradition here at Zolfo & Sons

41:51.340 --> 41:54.049
that when Dean plays
through those speakers,

41:54.050 --> 41:56.619
you give a little kiss to
the person you came with

41:56.620 --> 41:57.849
or a big one.

41:57.850 --> 41:59.040
