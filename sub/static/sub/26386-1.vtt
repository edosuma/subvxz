05:57.482 --> 05:58.316
Okay.

06:01.026 --> 06:02.610
Just give up already!

06:02.612 --> 06:10.495

a big monster.

07:06.634 --> 07:07.966
Joe has been eaten?

07:07.968 --> 07:09.594
That can't be true!

07:09.596 --> 07:11.471
And we've got
the monster trapped,

07:11.473 --> 07:13.432

07:29.699 --> 07:30.781
Now listen to me!

07:30.783 --> 07:33.534
I'm gonna tear you
limb from limb!

07:33.536 --> 07:36.704
Oh yeah, but you're never
gonna make it up here.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.123
Out of the way!

07:39.125 --> 07:40.666
What's that thingy?

07:45.464 --> 07:46.465
Let's go check on him.

07:50.011 --> 07:51.594
Looks like we took
care of the monster.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.555
Good work team.

07:53.555 --> 07:56.810
You, you're all
making me unhappy!

08:00.187 --> 08:05.860
I'm Joe Croaker, not a monster!

08:10.949 --> 08:13.365
Finally, freedom
comes to the froggy!

08:13.367 --> 08:16.118
Oh wow it is Joe
Croaker!

08:16.120 --> 08:17.620
You silly bugs!

08:17.622 --> 08:18.913
I'm gonna teach you a lesson!

08:18.915 --> 08:20.957
I just forgot, I've gotta go.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.877
I've gotta go gather
some nectar.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.966
Cosmo.

08:27.966 --> 08:28.798
You're not getting away.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.632
Calm down, what's that?

08:30.634 --> 08:32.134

You!

08:38.350 --> 08:40.144
Darn it, I'll get you!

08:58.370 --> 09:04.793
Another beautiful day
has come to the marsh.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.297
My belly's going to need
something to fill it on up.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.595
Something to eat, oh
something...

09:18.182 --> 09:20.100
Whoa, that looks great!

09:21.019 --> 09:22.017
Oh nectar!

09:23.104 --> 09:25.105
How wonderfully amazing!

09:38.745 --> 09:41.371
Isn't that Nitty way up there?

09:41.373 --> 09:43.958
So she likes the taste of
flowers as much as I do.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.294
That's delicious.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.969
Oh she's so cool, hanging from
her web by a single web silk?

09:57.346 --> 09:58.972
I'd like to do that too.

10:01.893 --> 10:04.685
Come on, I need something
as strong as Nitty's silk

10:04.687 --> 10:07.691
so that I can go
bungee jumping too!

10:10.402 --> 10:11.235
A bottle?

10:14.405 --> 10:17.158
There's no way.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.867
This is too stiff to
be really useful.

10:24.624 --> 10:28.086
Stupid stick!

10:28.086 --> 10:31.380
Ball of yarn, ooh that
could be useful.

10:37.386 --> 10:39.888
That ball of string could
work as a bungee cord.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.267
Oh, that's it!

10:44.436 --> 10:45.269
Fantastic!

10:53.695 --> 10:56.948
Now I'm ready to d
some bungee, oh yeah!

11:01.952 --> 11:03.661
It's so high, it's high!

11:14.381 --> 11:15.672
That's high!

11:15.674 --> 11:17.259
I'm not a tree frog!

11:24.933 --> 11:28.145
But if a spider could do it,
so can the famous Joe Croaker!

11:30.731 --> 11:33.610
Yoinkum, it's time to bungee!

11:33.610 --> 11:37.279
One two three four,
jump two three four.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.283
Oh no I can't do it!

11:43.285 --> 11:47.122
Oh no I really just I
can't do it, I can't do it!

11:51.628 --> 11:53.377
I'll just have to try this
another day.

11:53.379 --> 11:54.923
Yeah that's it,
another day yeah.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.061
Oh?

12:10.897 --> 12:13.525
Bungee jumping's bad for me.

12:24.619 --> 12:32.668
Well, cord wove too long then.

12:32.668 --> 12:34.835
Hey got you that time.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.587
Now that's better.

12:38.841 --> 12:42.844
And spool around, ooh and
that was for safety kids.

12:42.846 --> 12:43.804
Don't try this at home.

12:45.597 --> 12:48.849
Okay, you can do
this Joe Croaker.

12:48.851 --> 12:51.603
You can do it, you're a big
tough frog.

13:12.375 --> 13:16.502
Now why have I stopped
bouncing up and down?

13:25.179 --> 13:35.105
Oh where?

13:35.105 --> 13:37.397
If only I had bouncier cord.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.443
That might be a smart idea.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.997
There's nothing useful
in this dumpster here.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.041
I should try the dumpster
over by Nitty's house.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.959
Yeah that's it, well here we go.

14:00.465 --> 14:01.881
Okay.

14:01.883 --> 14:02.716
Oh boy.

14:11.142 --> 14:15.855
This time I will succeed, go!

14:20.067 --> 14:20.901
It's so high!

14:22.696 --> 14:23.902
Don't be scared.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.780
Okay, you can do this.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.592
Yeah doo-doo!

18:14.594 --> 18:17.221
Joe Croaker,
give it up already!

18:19.015 --> 18:21.351
Hey no no no!

18:21.351 --> 18:22.519
Oh you went too far.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.312
Joe Croaker, that was my lunch

18:26.314 --> 18:32.278
and you call yourself a friend!

18:32.278 --> 18:33.113
Cosmo!

18:35.323 --> 18:36.365
Cosmo.

18:38.117 --> 18:42.372
It's too late to beg for
forgiveness!

18:42.372 --> 18:46.584
No, my throat,
it hurts so badly!

18:48.420 --> 18:49.293
What's that?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.047
Let me have a look.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.296
Oh no!

18:53.298 --> 18:56.174
The fish bone's
stuck in Joe's throat.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.759
How am I gonna get it out?

18:57.761 --> 18:59.761
Joe, Joe Croaker, Joe!

18:59.763 --> 19:01.722
It hurts so bad!

19:01.724 --> 19:02.558
Ow ow!

19:08.565 --> 19:09.399
Oh whoa!

19:11.317 --> 19:14.192
Today sure is a
sweet day for honey.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.362
Someone help!

19:16.364 --> 19:17.988
Someone's calling for help.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.701
In trouble!

19:20.617 --> 19:22.785
Chill out guys!

19:22.787 --> 19:24.286
What's all this noise?

19:29.336 --> 19:30.211
It's Cosmo and Joe.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.838
Joe what's the matter, oh my!

19:38.428 --> 19:40.803
Bartle Bee, Bartle
Bee you gotta help Joe.

19:40.805 --> 19:42.638
A fish bone's
stuck in his throat.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.390
How'd that happen?

19:44.392 --> 19:46.225
Hang on Joe.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.978
Bartle Bee, what are
we gonna do now?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.938
Oh look I've got
some nectar here.

19:50.940 --> 19:54.402
Perhaps it'll help his, oh!

19:56.653 --> 19:58.779
Heya Joe, how ya feeling?

20:01.159 --> 20:02.115
Much better now.

20:02.117 --> 20:04.410
Yeah, that's great!

20:07.790 --> 20:08.625
Oh no it didn't work!

20:11.544 --> 20:12.794
- Joe!
- Joe hang in there!

20:12.796 --> 20:13.755
You'll be fine!

20:15.382 --> 20:17.507
Bartle Bee, Bartle Bee, do
something!

20:17.509 --> 20:18.882
I remember reading about
fish bone emergencies

20:18.884 --> 20:22.055
in a handbook, and they mentioned
two different solutions.

20:23.306 --> 20:26.349
Oh yeah, bread and vinegar,
Cosmo.

20:26.351 --> 20:28.726
Huh, where'd they go?

20:28.728 --> 20:30.522
Where is it?

20:40.365 --> 20:41.825
What, what is it?

20:50.290 --> 20:52.374
Hey Joe, come on up here.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.710
Cosmo, what is it?

20:54.712 --> 20:57.046
This here is a steamed bun.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.965
It's a traditional Chinese bread

20:58.967 --> 21:00.967
and it'll cure your problem.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.595
Come on Joe, swallow it.

21:03.846 --> 21:04.722
Hm, steamed bun.

21:06.391 --> 21:09.519
It's huge and hard as a rock.

21:09.519 --> 21:12.103
This thing can help you remove
the bone from your throat.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.689
You do want it gone, don't ya?

21:14.691 --> 21:20.739
Now swallow it.

21:20.739 --> 21:21.655
Huh, let me see.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.624
Get there, get in there!

21:32.791 --> 21:34.374
It just won't go down.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.376
All right, time
to give this sucker

21:36.378 --> 21:38.587
a taste of my killer kicks!

21:43.928 --> 21:45.344
Did it work, did it work?

21:45.346 --> 21:47.971
Joe, how you feeling now Joe?

21:47.973 --> 21:49.015
Any better?

21:55.773 --> 21:56.857
It's still there.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.818
No, oh what now?

22:00.612 --> 22:01.446
Well.

22:02.614 --> 22:05.698
This bottle of vinegar is our
last resort.

22:05.700 --> 22:08.161
Bartle Bee said it will
help dissolve the bone.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.002
Joe, open wide!

22:24.635 --> 22:25.470
Oh no Joe!

22:27.931 --> 22:30.974
Joe Joe Joe, Joe!

22:30.974 --> 22:31.850
How does it taste?

22:33.435 --> 22:34.770
Oh Joe, you're drowning!

22:38.191 --> 22:39.981
Joe, wake up!

22:39.983 --> 22:43.276
What am I gonna do, what am I
gonna do, what am I gonna do?

22:43.278 --> 22:44.903
Say Cosmo, how's Joe doing?

22:44.905 --> 22:46.823
Bartle Bee, not good.

22:46.825 --> 22:48.660
The bone's still
stuck in his throat.

22:50.412 --> 22:51.746
Cosmo, help me!

22:55.916 --> 22:57.124
Come on!

22:57.126 --> 22:59.253
One two, oh we can do it!

23:01.463 --> 23:02.796
Come on Joe!

23:06.635 --> 23:08.469
That's it, come on!

23:15.310 --> 23:17.355
Well I think our
work is done here.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.986
Houses nowadays, they
just don't satisfy me.

23:24.988 --> 23:28.240
They're either too retro,
or too low quality.

23:29.284 --> 23:32.245
Gee, I want comfort, yeah.

23:34.204 --> 23:37.332
Wow, what a beautiful paper box.

23:44.673 --> 23:49.220
Wow, it's so spacious!

23:49.220 --> 23:51.929
And the view around here ain't
bad either.

23:54.851 --> 23:57.184
Bartle Bee, Bartle Bee,
check it out!

23:57.186 --> 24:00.438
Look, I just found
myself a new dream home.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.815
Ain't it something,
what do you think huh?

24:02.817 --> 24:05.860
Hey, are you sure you'd want
to live in an old paper box?

24:05.862 --> 24:08.863
If it starts raining, your
house will be destroyed.

24:08.865 --> 24:11.657
Oh I guess.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.535
Oh but nothing can affect a
glass beauty!

24:14.537 --> 24:16.873
This home is even brighter.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.084
Wow!

24:19.917 --> 24:26.674
And I can see everything, cool.

24:26.674 --> 24:28.009
Who's that guy?

24:29.594 --> 24:30.428
Really?

24:36.684 --> 24:39.811
Uh-oh, well hey there
kid what are you doing?

24:39.813 --> 24:42.771
I wouldn't be hanging around
there, it's almost noon.

24:42.773 --> 24:43.940
You're gonna burn in there,

24:43.942 --> 24:45.777
like a t-bone steak in a Texas
barbecue.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.534
Paper houses rip,
glass houses aren't safe.

24:54.536 --> 24:57.413
Is there any hope in this
blasted world?

25:01.291 --> 25:05.963
Look at this giant magnet.

25:11.051 --> 25:12.634
Yeah, I know!

25:20.729 --> 25:21.563
Ah!

25:26.651 --> 25:32.574
Yeah, mission accomplished!

25:32.574 --> 25:36.324
This is exactly how I
imagined my dream house.

25:37.662 --> 25:41.788
Woohoo, yeah I'm rocking the
coolest home in the marsh!

25:47.797 --> 25:49.758
Better test its nap-ability.

26:08.777 --> 26:10.111
It's way too hot.

26:11.779 --> 26:12.946
It's sweltering.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.045
Oh no it won't move!

26:29.047 --> 26:31.546
Someone help me!

26:31.548 --> 26:33.425
I'm trapped in my house!

26:38.722 --> 26:40.642
- I love me.
- Help me!

26:41.851 --> 26:43.812
- Cosmo, oh!
- Someone help me!

26:45.105 --> 26:46.144
Joe, Joe help me!

26:46.146 --> 26:47.147
Hey, yeah!

26:49.526 --> 26:50.691
I'm stuck in my house.

26:50.693 --> 26:51.942
What?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.026
You gotta help me out.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.237
Help you out?

26:54.239 --> 26:56.738
It's a long story, just help
me out Joe.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.158
Come here quick.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.288
Look, the coin is
blocking the door.

27:03.248 --> 27:04.913
You gotta help me remove it.

27:04.915 --> 27:08.750
Okay, no problem
but now you have to do

27:08.752 --> 27:10.004
everything I tell you to do.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.088
Really?

27:13.090 --> 27:15.257
I don't know about that, Joe.

27:15.259 --> 27:17.677
Now listen, you'll have
to be my housekeeper,

27:17.679 --> 27:21.514
my private masseuse, and
half of all your food, yeah.

27:21.516 --> 27:23.516
All right, anything you want.

27:23.518 --> 27:25.601
Just get me out.

27:25.603 --> 27:26.728
Okay.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.605
Come on!

27:34.695 --> 27:35.777
I'm worn out.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.113
Come on Cosmo, would ya?

28:05.809 --> 28:08.812
Yeah finally made
it out of there!

28:14.318 --> 28:16.818
Joe, Joe you gotta
help me again!

28:16.820 --> 28:18.655
Please Joe, come on!

28:19.449 --> 28:23.992
You quit playing tricks,
or you'll pay, take that!

28:23.994 --> 28:24.828
Oh no!

28:50.020 --> 28:51.062
Are you all right?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.488
Oh my Cosmo, you all right?

29:00.490 --> 29:02.616
Can you hear me in there?

29:06.829 --> 29:09.874
I'm so sorry.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.585
Why couldn't I help you buddy?

29:14.921 --> 29:16.045
It's all my fault.

29:16.047 --> 29:18.881
You were always my best friend!

29:18.883 --> 29:20.259
I would have given anything!

29:21.176 --> 29:22.009
If I came
back would you

29:22.011 --> 29:23.803
bully me like you used to?

29:23.805 --> 29:24.931
Oh absolutely not!

29:26.098 --> 29:27.597
And?

29:27.599 --> 29:30.267
I'd be your housekeeper,
your private masseur...

29:30.269 --> 29:31.270
All right.

29:35.650 --> 29:36.567
You were saying?

29:38.528 --> 29:40.737
Oh thank goodness
you're still alive, Cosmo.

29:40.739 --> 29:42.363
I can't breathe!

29:42.365 --> 29:45.490
I thought you'd been
squashed into a little pancake.

29:45.492 --> 29:49.411
Almost, but this little guy
saved me.

29:49.413 --> 29:54.961
Joe save me Joe!

29:54.961 --> 29:56.421
What am I gonna do?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.055
Hey, like my hat?

30:05.055 --> 30:05.928
You tricked me.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.265
Now take this friend!

30:08.599 --> 30:09.891
Oh not a bad place.

30:09.893 --> 30:11.933
You looking for a roomie?

30:17.733 --> 30:19.485
Come on, this
place isn't safe!

30:24.074 --> 30:28.284
Yeah buddy, so that's how
I escaped and survived.

30:28.286 --> 30:29.994
Speaking of which, Joe.

30:29.996 --> 30:33.581
You're my housekeeper and
private masseur right?

30:33.583 --> 30:34.584
All right.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.217
I must have hit
the jackpot today

30:44.219 --> 30:47.386
by finding this lucky
limited edition stamp.

30:47.388 --> 30:49.431
Now I can replace the old one.

30:51.643 --> 30:55.438
Fly scream you scream we
all scream for ice cream!

30:56.980 --> 30:58.857
And by scream I mean dance!

31:09.118 --> 31:10.242
What's he doing?

31:10.244 --> 31:12.204
It don't get much
better than this.

31:14.082 --> 31:15.792
Whoa, my word!

31:17.460 --> 31:18.545
I love ice cream.

31:24.174 --> 31:27.053
Oh so tasty!

31:27.053 --> 31:29.261
I'm going to get me
some of that.

31:38.565 --> 31:40.940
Come back stamp, come back!

31:40.942 --> 31:42.652
Stamp come back here!

31:43.653 --> 31:46.319

you can run away?

31:46.321 --> 31:50.117
Wait 'til I get my hands on you!

31:50.117 --> 31:55.707
My beautiful, beautiful stamp!

31:55.707 --> 31:57.083
Yah, there ya are!

31:58.209 --> 31:59.208
Oh baby!

32:02.713 --> 32:03.548
Ooh.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.259
Here's my chance, yeah.

32:11.181 --> 32:12.220
I'm tired.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.223
I need a nap.

32:14.808 --> 32:18.313
You.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.073
This is the perfect spot.

32:30.616 --> 32:32.951
Time to get some lovely Zs.

32:36.080 --> 32:36.914
Hey you!

32:38.083 --> 32:40.415
You wily pest, get
own from there!

32:40.417 --> 32:43.212
There's no way you
can hide from me!

32:47.049 --> 33:03.148
Now I'm gonna spring
right up there.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.317
No mommy, I don't want it.

33:09.905 --> 33:11.488
Okay.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.701
This'll do it.

33:26.756 --> 33:28.967
You traitor, I'll get you!

33:33.137 --> 33:33.971
Come on.

33:44.065 --> 33:45.232
All right, fire!

33:50.779 --> 33:53.282
Ooh I'm coming!

34:03.667 --> 34:05.209
Can't climb up.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.253
Can't jump up, can't fly up.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.213
What to do?

34:10.215 --> 34:11.547
Woe is me.

34:11.550 --> 34:12.384
My ice cream.

34:14.262 --> 34:15.096
Oh?

34:16.139 --> 34:17.387
I see.

34:17.389 --> 34:20.516
Hey, I could use those vines.

34:20.518 --> 34:22.143
You'll see,
I'll get it this time.

34:40.914 --> 34:43.041
Almost there.

34:43.041 --> 34:48.713
I can do this.

34:55.302 --> 34:57.260
Sleep tight there buddy.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.848
I won't disturb ya, come on.

35:01.351 --> 35:02.184
Almost!

35:12.195 --> 35:13.695
I gotcha now.

35:13.697 --> 35:14.945
Ooh!

35:32.423 --> 35:36.969
All that work for nothing.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.053
Oh forget it.

35:41.224 --> 35:42.057
It's not

35:43.518 --> 35:47.146
real ice cream anyway.

35:47.146 --> 35:49.398
Huh, something's on my tushy.

35:50.525 --> 35:51.526
What the?

36:14.882 --> 36:16.340
Well that didn't work.

36:16.342 --> 36:18.010
I gotta try and
find another way.

36:19.471 --> 36:20.304
That's it!

36:37.530 --> 36:39.447
I've labored long and I've
labored hard

36:39.449 --> 36:40.655
and now I've got ya.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.916
What's that smelly stinky smell?

36:50.001 --> 36:51.249
Oh no!

36:51.251 --> 36:56.298
That's icky.

How are they gonna cross?

38:45.449 --> 38:48.242

Hey, that's it, I got it.

39:01.882 --> 39:04.009

Bridge by Joe, engineer Joe.

39:11.434 --> 39:12.977
It was too short.

39:17.565 --> 39:20.483

be long enough

39:20.485 --> 39:21.945

39:57.313 --> 39:58.565
I still can't cross it.

39:59.523 --> 40:02.317
All right, I'll find
a stronger log yet.

40:15.623 --> 40:17.248
Mission accomplished.

40:17.250 --> 40:19.499

40:19.501 --> 40:25.342

40:27.135 --> 40:29.012
I'll just rest my eyes.

40:37.896 --> 40:41.646
Oh, when did they build a
bridge here?

40:41.648 --> 40:46.070
Never mind.

40:46.070 --> 40:48.445
Ah, now I don't
have to fly over.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.488
That's so great!

40:55.996 --> 40:58.791

46:06.849 --> 46:08.599
He's still looking at me.

46:08.601 --> 46:10.101
Hey there Joe.

46:10.103 --> 46:12.103
What are you doing here?

46:12.105 --> 46:12.979
You're talking to me?

46:12.981 --> 46:14.521
Why are you acting so sneaky?

46:14.523 --> 46:15.482
What's going on?

46:18.277 --> 46:20.028
There's a giant owl after me.

46:20.030 --> 46:22.030
A giant what?

46:22.032 --> 46:23.074
He's right over there.

46:25.492 --> 46:26.326
See?

46:28.829 --> 46:30.662
Why isn't he moving?

46:30.664 --> 46:34.249
He's probably waiting for
a chance to pounce on me.

46:34.251 --> 46:35.711
It's too scary!

46:36.880 --> 46:39.130
Oh, something's wrong here,

46:39.132 --> 46:41.800
but I can't quite
put my finger on it.

46:49.016 --> 46:50.476
How come he won't move?

46:55.231 --> 46:57.481
Oh, hey there big guy!

46:57.483 --> 47:00.901
Can you see me, I'm right in
front of you!

47:00.903 --> 47:02.989
Hello!

47:02.989 --> 47:04.490
Let me take a look.

47:11.789 --> 47:13.291
It's made of paper.

47:14.876 --> 47:16.127
Hey, I've got it!

47:17.461 --> 47:19.255
Hey Joe, come on out.

47:20.090 --> 47:23.259
This isn't a real owl,
it's actually a paper kite.

47:24.635 --> 47:25.719
Oh, a kite?

47:37.815 --> 47:43.153
Fly high kite!

47:43.153 --> 47:45.657
Oh, I was running really fast,

47:48.159 --> 47:50.954
but it still wasn't able to fly.

47:55.416 --> 47:58.166
- Boy this is really fun.
- This is really fun!

47:59.295 --> 48:00.213
Righty-o.

48:04.175 --> 48:07.762
Okay you, now if
I slide down here...

48:10.597 --> 48:12.264
That looks dangerous!

48:12.266 --> 48:13.391
I'm afraid.

48:13.393 --> 48:14.516
We'll have to look
for something else,

48:14.518 --> 48:17.229
something that
I'm not afraid of.

48:31.077 --> 48:33.079
Help me help me help me!

48:40.210 --> 48:44.173
All right yeah, yeah!

48:49.346 --> 48:51.887
What's going on, whoa hey!

48:53.266 --> 48:55.059
Hey, this is not cool!

49:01.023 --> 49:02.273
It's so fun.

49:02.275 --> 49:03.860
I'm really flying!

49:11.159 --> 49:15.288
So painful.

49:15.288 --> 49:17.162
Hey where is Joe?

49:17.164 --> 49:18.625

49:27.175 --> 49:30.427
Kite there.

49:31.721 --> 49:33.929
Well that's just scary!

49:33.931 --> 49:35.599
That doesn't look like a kite.

49:37.143 --> 49:38.144
Where did he go?

49:41.231 --> 49:44.148
Ah, hey Joe get down from there!

49:44.150 --> 49:45.026
I'm getting my kite!

49:46.277 --> 49:48.735
Get down, it's dangerous hey!

49:48.737 --> 49:51.197
McBroom, what's going on?

49:51.199 --> 49:52.572
Joe has lost his mind.

49:52.574 --> 49:55.117
He's trying to go after that
giant bird.

49:55.119 --> 49:56.869
- Oh Joey!
- Come back!

49:56.871 --> 49:58.162
- What are you doing?

cheese here.

51:09.360 --> 51:13.197

56:45.070 --> 56:46.447

57:52.012 --> 57:54.429
Cosmo hang in there!

58:00.396 --> 58:03.063
I need to find a
way to stop that.

58:03.065 --> 58:03.899
I know!

58:07.778 --> 58:11.990
Almost, this should
do the trick.

58:33.847 --> 58:35.804
He's at the edge!

58:35.806 --> 58:37.891
Oh no we gotta move fast!

58:49.570 --> 58:50.862
Bartle Bee!

Two three!

58:56.077 --> 58:59.414
I think we should take a break.

59:01.206 --> 59:03.291
- I'm tired.
- Oh yeah.

59:03.293 --> 59:04.878
My wings are aching.

59:51.882 --> 59:55.302
That smells nice, and
it looks super pretty!

59:56.137 --> 59:57.220
Wow!

59:57.222 --> 59:58.970
That's amazing!

59:58.972 --> 01:00:00.389
I'll bet it tastes good.

01:00:03.686 --> 01:00:04.645
Oh, delicious!

01:00:09.108 --> 01:00:10.235
I feel dizzy.

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.238
Hey you, bat and sparrow!

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:17.826
You better fly fast!

01:00:20.327 --> 01:00:23.414
I'm fuming and I'm
coming to get you!

01:00:26.251 --> 01:00:28.628
I love to sing.

01:00:28.628 --> 01:00:30.505
The best frog in the world.

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.758
I wonder what's
wrong with Bartle.

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.552
He sure looks mad.

01:00:40.931 --> 01:00:41.765
Ooh!

01:00:42.559 --> 01:00:43.810
That's just beautiful.

01:00:45.228 --> 01:00:46.604
Amazing!

01:00:50.983 --> 01:00:53.110
Grow plant grow, oh yeah!

01:00:54.737 --> 01:00:56.112
Fantastic!

01:00:56.114 --> 01:00:59.322
Now my garden's better than
that snooty Flutterby's.

01:00:59.324 --> 01:01:01.035
I'm the best gardener ever.

01:01:02.536 --> 01:01:03.827
Mmm.

01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:07.123
Wow, what's that smell?

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.958
Joe you gotta tell me,
what's the name

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.918
of this magical smelling plant?

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:19.804
You know, well Cosmo
the name is aromatica!

01:01:19.804 --> 01:01:21.929
This plant's mine, hands off.

01:01:21.931 --> 01:01:24.057
It smells so dreamy!

01:01:24.059 --> 01:01:24.974
Sorry.

01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:27.769
Hey this aromatica
plant's mine.

01:01:27.771 --> 01:01:29.144
You stay away or I'll have ya.

01:01:29.146 --> 01:01:30.313
Whatever Joe!

01:01:30.315 --> 01:01:31.148
It's lame anyway!

01:01:33.485 --> 01:01:35.487
You pesky bug,
what did you say?

01:01:37.237 --> 01:01:38.987
Oh my aromatica.

01:01:40.824 --> 01:01:42.950
Smells so good.

01:01:42.952 --> 01:01:44.869
Okay, you must be thirsty.

01:01:44.871 --> 01:01:46.623
I'll go get some water, yup.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:54.003
It's good to be retired.

01:01:54.005 --> 01:01:56.090
I can, hey what was that?

01:01:58.677 --> 01:02:00.260
What a great smell!

01:02:04.014 --> 01:02:04.848
Hey.

01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.771
Oh just smell that.

01:02:10.813 --> 01:02:12.731
Man that tastes so great!

01:02:20.239 --> 01:02:22.782
I think I feel a little dizzy.

01:02:26.871 --> 01:02:28.914
Who wants to mess with the
sarge?

01:02:34.003 --> 01:02:39.300
Come out and show
yourself like a real man.

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.135
Here we go aromatica, yeah!

01:02:42.137 --> 01:02:42.969
Okie-dokie huh?

01:02:42.971 --> 01:02:44.554
Hey here we go.

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:46.930
And a little bit more
from this side.

01:02:46.932 --> 01:02:48.934
Tadah!

01:02:48.934 --> 01:02:50.019
Ah boy, lovely.

01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:52.313
Ooh!

01:02:53.815 --> 01:02:57.527
Someone's been munching
on my sweet baby!

01:02:57.527 --> 01:02:59.068
I'm going to make
whoever did this pay.

01:02:59.070 --> 01:03:01.030
And I bet, it was
that stinking fly.

01:03:08.163 --> 01:03:09.704
A cake and an apple.

01:03:09.706 --> 01:03:11.539
- All I need...
- Cosmo!

01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:13.916
I told you to stay away
from my plant!

01:03:13.918 --> 01:03:14.958
What?

01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:16.543
It wasn't me Joe, I promise.

01:03:16.545 --> 01:03:18.713
Not so fast!

01:03:18.715 --> 01:03:21.009
Joe Croaker!

01:03:21.009 --> 01:03:23.175
Please let me out of this can!

01:03:23.177 --> 01:03:25.262
It wasn't me, please Joe!

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:30.518
Let me out of this, it's
dark and scary in here!

01:03:38.233 --> 01:03:39.983
That lousy amphibian!

01:03:39.985 --> 01:03:41.820
He always takes his
aggression out on me.

01:03:43.114 --> 01:03:44.199
I don't think so!

01:03:46.076 --> 01:03:47.409
Oh, deliciousness!

01:03:58.545 --> 01:03:59.380
Joe, ah!

01:04:02.967 --> 01:04:04.508
What a beautiful day.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:06.010
Joe Croaker!

01:04:06.012 --> 01:04:07.555
You better get your hop on!

01:04:10.809 --> 01:04:11.643
Joe.

01:04:12.726 --> 01:04:14.061
Payback time!

01:04:26.949 --> 01:04:28.574
This is weird, feel
like I've been

01:04:28.576 --> 01:04:31.159
dragged through
a bush backwards.

01:04:31.161 --> 01:04:34.162
What happened to me yesterday?

01:04:34.164 --> 01:04:35.581
I'm sure it was nothing.

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:37.335
I'm gonna go see
what Joe's up to.

01:04:40.755 --> 01:04:41.588
Hey Joe!

01:04:43.257 --> 01:04:45.843
Hey best buddy,
good morning sunshine.

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:48.471
How dare ya?

01:04:50.556 --> 01:04:52.264
What happened to your face?

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:53.893
How'd you get all those bruises?

01:04:59.773 --> 01:05:02.609
- Joe, what's wrong with you?
- Sorry.

01:05:04.028 --> 01:05:05.822
Seems to be scared of me.

01:05:07.157 --> 01:05:08.865
Listen up frog, I'm parched.

01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.074
Go get me some fresh dew off

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:12.702
the flower petals,
and make it snappy!

01:05:12.704 --> 01:05:13.538
Sure.

01:05:14.581 --> 01:05:16.956
That's something
I don't see everyday.

01:05:16.958 --> 01:05:20.126
He always takes his aggression
out on me.

01:05:20.128 --> 01:05:21.296
I don't think so.

01:05:23.255 --> 01:05:25.340
It's coming back to me now.

01:05:25.342 --> 01:05:28.885
Yesterday I ate some of
his precious flower buds,

01:05:28.887 --> 01:05:30.927
and they were tasty.

01:05:30.929 --> 01:05:35.099
Cosmo, here's the dew
that you were asking for.

01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:36.809
Stay away from my property!

01:05:36.811 --> 01:05:39.061
Quit yelling at me, fool!

01:05:39.063 --> 01:05:41.396
Here, it's your morning dew.

01:05:41.398 --> 01:05:43.523
Get that stinking dew out of
my face!

01:05:43.525 --> 01:05:45.610
The only thing I want
to eat is that plant,

01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:47.278
now bring it to my place.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:49.237
No wait, I can't do that.

01:05:49.239 --> 01:05:51.115
Sorry, say again?

01:05:51.117 --> 01:05:52.952
You want another
taste of my left hook?

01:05:54.536 --> 01:05:58.164
That's weird, why is
Cosmo a baddie now?

01:05:58.166 --> 01:06:01.126
Could it be because of
the aromatica he ate?

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:04.047
I'm Cosmo and I'm the best!

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.173
I want some.

01:06:12.012 --> 01:06:13.179
Joe?

01:06:13.181 --> 01:06:14.724
Hey Joe, are you okay?

01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:17.391
Yeah.

01:06:17.393 --> 01:06:19.436
I'm gonna teach
you a lesson, here.

01:06:22.315 --> 01:06:27.275
- What'd he say?
- I'm gonna catch ya.

01:06:27.277 --> 01:06:28.612
It's the key!

01:06:33.117 --> 01:06:35.034
All right Joe, you want a fight?

01:06:35.036 --> 01:06:37.454
You got one, here I come.

01:06:45.088 --> 01:06:48.380
You can't beat me, little fly.

01:06:48.382 --> 01:06:50.133
We'll see about that.

01:07:08.152 --> 01:07:13.115
Dig in, huh?

01:07:13.115 --> 01:07:14.617
What is that there thing?

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:35.552
All right!

01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:41.353
I'm a happy little fly!

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:46.313
How do I get this thing home
with me?

01:07:46.315 --> 01:07:47.149
That's it!

01:07:59.161 --> 01:08:01.329
That baby's heavy.

01:08:01.331 --> 01:08:04.250
It won't even budge an inch.

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:05.543
- Gotta think of...
- Hey.

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:11.255
You scared me Joe.

01:08:11.257 --> 01:08:12.840
What are you doing here Cosmo?

01:08:12.842 --> 01:08:15.885
Hey Joe, guess what I found.

01:08:15.887 --> 01:08:17.845
It's a fantastical toy car.

01:08:22.685 --> 01:08:23.893
Pretty cool huh?

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:25.188
What do you think?

01:08:27.856 --> 01:08:29.357
I'm a treasure hunter.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.444
No treasure can hide
away from me.

01:08:35.238 --> 01:08:37.197
Joe, Joe what are you doing?

01:08:37.198 --> 01:08:38.451
Joe that car belongs to me!

01:08:42.162 --> 01:08:45.582
This car has a new master,
and that master is me!

01:08:52.171 --> 01:08:53.548
I'm taking you home.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.551
Yeah that's right.

01:09:04.935 --> 01:09:05.768
Hey!

01:09:05.770 --> 01:09:06.604
Not that way!

01:09:07.313 --> 01:09:08.398
Back over this way!

01:09:09.439 --> 01:09:11.274
Always being
taken advantage of.

01:09:23.496 --> 01:09:26.497
No no no no no no
no no no no no no!

01:09:39.804 --> 01:09:44.015
So you stopped when
I asked you to.

01:09:46.853 --> 01:09:49.812
There you are, bad running
away from me.

01:09:49.814 --> 01:09:51.813
It wasn't fair!

01:09:51.814 --> 01:09:54.483
Hey Joe, guess what?

01:09:54.485 --> 01:09:56.779
I made it stop, so it's mine.

01:10:03.118 --> 01:10:04.787
The car knows who's boss.

01:10:11.336 --> 01:10:14.253
Hey, you get back here!

01:10:14.255 --> 01:10:23.305
Stop please!

01:10:23.305 --> 01:10:26.893
Now's my chance!

01:10:26.893 --> 01:10:28.476
Here we go!

01:10:28.478 --> 01:10:29.604
I command you to stop!

01:10:32.314 --> 01:10:33.357
It didn't work.

01:10:34.484 --> 01:10:35.318
Stop!

01:10:44.452 --> 01:10:46.788
It sure is hard to
tame this thing.

01:10:50.207 --> 01:10:51.041
Wait on.

01:10:52.627 --> 01:10:55.338
Every time I get to here it
starts doing its own thing.

01:10:56.588 --> 01:10:58.423
Mhmm, that's it!

01:10:58.425 --> 01:11:00.633
I'm not gonna let you run away.

01:11:17.944 --> 01:11:19.485
That'll do it.

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:40.800
Okay, now be a good boy
and stay right there.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:51.603
On your marks, get set, charge!

01:11:51.603 --> 01:11:53.229
Come on now, yeah!

01:11:57.192 --> 01:11:59.232
I was just kidding!

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:26.845
That was a close one.

01:12:26.845 --> 01:12:30.138
But really fun, come on awesome!

01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:31.518
Yeah yeah, woohoo!

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:34.854
Yeah yeah!

01:12:44.488 --> 01:12:49.577
Is that food?

01:12:49.577 --> 01:12:50.951
What the?

01:12:50.953 --> 01:12:53.412
Thanks for the treat, Cosmo!

01:12:53.414 --> 01:12:54.621
My, my cheese!

01:12:54.623 --> 01:12:56.001
Come and get it!

01:13:29.367 --> 01:13:30.869
Give it back Joe!

01:13:32.828 --> 01:13:34.704
Are you all right there Joe?

01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:35.832
And where's my cheese?

01:13:39.918 --> 01:13:40.753
Give it!

01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:42.794
It's my lunch now.

01:13:42.796 --> 01:13:45.132
- No way it's mine!
- It's mine!

01:13:49.845 --> 01:13:51.388
No way not again!

01:13:54.975 --> 01:13:56.478
Oh no my cheese!

01:13:57.729 --> 01:13:59.189
Joe you crashed my car!

01:14:03.693 --> 01:14:05.651
Hey Joe, Joe you owe me

01:14:05.653 --> 01:14:09.405
a new piece of cheese,
and a new car.

01:14:09.407 --> 01:14:10.740
Joe wake up!

01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:12.243
Oh he wasn't insured.
