00:05.767 --> 00:07.400
- I was the president

00:07.433 --> 00:09.200
of the Itty Bitty Titty
Committee.

00:09.266 --> 00:10.567
- The scar tissue formed.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.166
It sucked the lower portion
of the breast tissue in.

00:13.200 --> 00:14.533
- Right.

00:14.567 --> 00:16.000
I've had this issue
for 12 years.

00:16.033 --> 00:17.133
You would think, by this time,

00:17.166 --> 00:18.400
I would be able to be over it,

00:18.433 --> 00:20.533
but it's hard.

00:20.567 --> 00:23.166
- It's all just completely
fused together

00:23.200 --> 00:25.400
into one scarified mess,

00:25.433 --> 00:27.166
like breast hell.

00:27.200 --> 00:31.000
- I am determined,
and I am beyond committed

00:31.033 --> 00:32.266

00:32.300 --> 00:34.400
- So you want to be
like her physically.

00:34.433 --> 00:37.333
- Yes, her classic,
all-American features.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.133
- Isn't Ivanka's mom

00:39.200 --> 00:40.567
from Eastern Europe?

00:40.600 --> 00:43.000
I think she has her facts
a little messed up.

00:43.066 --> 00:44.333
- So he put something

00:44.367 --> 00:46.166
inside this part of the nose
to lift it up?

00:46.200 --> 00:47.200
- Yes.

00:47.233 --> 00:48.233
- And it popped out
of your nose.

00:48.300 --> 00:49.567
- Yes.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.433

Marlene's last chance

I'm 39 years old,

01:12.367 --> 01:14.333
and I'm from Long Beach,
California.

01:14.367 --> 01:16.200
I went in for discount surgery

01:16.233 --> 01:18.567
and came out
with breasts half off.

01:18.600 --> 01:22.600
In high school, I was
co-captain of the drill team.

01:22.633 --> 01:24.233
I won homecoming queen.

01:24.266 --> 01:25.500
I was the life of the party.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.533
And I loved my body.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.333
The only thing I didn't like
was how small my breasts were.

01:30.367 --> 01:33.300
I was the president of
the Itty Bitty Titty Committee.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.100
I had really little titties.

01:36.133 --> 01:38.333
I knew I was gonna get surgery

01:38.367 --> 01:40.233
as soon as I got some money.

01:40.266 --> 01:41.633
I called
several plastic surgeons

01:41.667 --> 01:43.200
in California,

01:43.233 --> 01:45.333
and they were charging
about 8,500.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.667
I had a lot of friends
that went to a doctor in Utah

01:47.734 --> 01:50.233
that did their breasts
because he was cheaper,

01:50.266 --> 01:52.066
so I weighed my options.

01:52.100 --> 01:54.200
3,500 or 8,500?

01:54.233 --> 01:55.767
I went with the 3,500.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.433
The doctor had it set up
kind of strange,

01:58.500 --> 02:00.333
because the first day
I got there,

02:00.367 --> 02:01.367
I had my consult.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.400
The next day, I had my surgery.

02:03.433 --> 02:05.300
The following day,
I had my checkup.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.266
And the day after that, I was
on my way back to California.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.400
And then they had a shuttle
where they would pick you up

02:11.433 --> 02:13.633
and then take you to get
your surgery at the hospital.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.367
It was like a group of women

02:15.400 --> 02:17.233
that all went
and got their breasts done

02:17.266 --> 02:19.300
around the same time
from the same doctor.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.667
Now, talking about it, yeah,

02:21.700 --> 02:24.100
it does seem like
it was a factory.

02:24.133 --> 02:28.100
But once I looked down and saw
that I officially had breasts,

02:28.133 --> 02:29.400
my body looked fulfilled.

02:29.433 --> 02:31.233
I was very happy
with the results

02:31.266 --> 02:33.066
of my breast implants.

02:33.133 --> 02:35.500
When I was pregnant with my son,
I gained 94 pounds,

02:35.533 --> 02:39.500
and from that,
my beautiful 34C cup breasts

02:39.533 --> 02:41.266
turned into pancakes.

02:41.300 --> 02:44.100
So I went back to Utah,
to the same exact doctor.

02:44.166 --> 02:47.533
But one actually ended up being
larger than the other,

02:47.567 --> 02:50.133
so that's when I went back
for my third surgery.

02:50.166 --> 02:53.400
And with these, one ended up
getting harder than the other,

02:53.433 --> 02:55.433
so then they really looked
different,

02:55.467 --> 02:57.433
and then there was a dent
under one of my breasts.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.166
And then eventually,
there was a dent

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
under the other one as well,

03:01.266 --> 03:02.667
and that's when I was like,
"I can no longer take this,"

03:02.700 --> 03:05.667
because they hurt,
so I got them removed.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.400
That's when I went
into deep depression,

03:09.433 --> 03:12.133
'cause I knew I did that
to my own body.

03:12.166 --> 03:15.133
I drank a lot,
and I ate a lot,

03:15.166 --> 03:17.467
and the weight kept coming on
and kept coming on.

03:17.533 --> 03:18.667
There was a period of time

03:18.700 --> 03:20.266
where I didn't even leave
my house

03:20.300 --> 03:21.667
for about four years.

03:21.700 --> 03:25.166
At my heaviest,
I was 282 pounds.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.567

03:32.333 --> 03:33.367
- Are you sure
you want to do this?

03:33.433 --> 03:34.567
Looks like it's gonna rain.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.633
- Doesn't matter
if it rains, Mye.

03:35.700 --> 03:36.700
We got to do this.

03:36.734 --> 03:38.333
- Okay.
- Let's get it in.

03:38.367 --> 03:40.433
- On August 26, 2014,

03:40.467 --> 03:41.600
I put on a pair
of tennis shoes,

03:41.633 --> 03:42.734
and I walked.

03:42.767 --> 03:44.166
Walking has really changed
my mood.

03:44.200 --> 03:45.433
It makes me happy.

- Thank you.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.667
- Real good.
- You guys are looking good too.

03:48.734 --> 03:49.700
You've lost a lot of weight.

03:49.734 --> 03:51.166
- How much have you lost?

03:51.200 --> 03:53.533
- I lost now
a little over 90 pounds.

03:53.600 --> 03:55.300
- Whoo.
- Wow.

03:55.333 --> 03:56.700
- I realized in order to have

03:56.734 --> 03:57.734
a successful surgery,

03:57.767 --> 03:59.433
I needed to lose weight,

03:59.467 --> 04:01.467
because I knew
I was morbidly obese.

04:01.500 --> 04:03.333
I couldn't even walk
a whole block

04:03.367 --> 04:06.266
without taking a break,
so I knew there was no way

04:06.333 --> 04:08.500
that anybody would want
to do surgery on me.

04:08.533 --> 04:10.467
I reached out to Dr. Dubrow,

04:10.500 --> 04:12.734
and now I get to go
for a consult.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.233
- That's exciting.
- That's great.

04:15.266 --> 04:17.333

at the breast crease.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.600
- Yeah, you got your work
cut out for you.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.700
- Well, I don't--
she's missing breast tissue.

08:23.734 --> 08:25.533
Please bring in Chanel,
would you?

08:25.567 --> 08:26.533
- Sure.

08:26.567 --> 08:27.767
Can you please send in Chanel?

08:29.433 --> 08:31.467
- Hello.
- Chanel?

08:31.533 --> 08:33.000
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.600
- Getting this opportunity today

08:34.667 --> 08:36.767
is much different
than it was two years ago,

08:37.033 --> 08:38.200
because I'm in better shape.

08:38.266 --> 08:40.667
I know my body can handle it.

08:40.700 --> 08:42.600
I'm ready.
- Take us back.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.000
You had your original
breast surgery

08:44.033 --> 08:45.133
how many years ago?

08:45.166 --> 08:46.533
- When I turned 21,
in '99.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.567
- So how did that one go?

08:47.600 --> 08:48.600
- It went perfect.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.533
It took me from an A
to a C,

08:50.567 --> 08:51.667
and they were beautiful.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.600
- You were happy.
- Really happy.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.400
- So why did you have
a second surgery?

08:55.433 --> 08:57.100
- When I got pregnant
with my kid,

08:57.166 --> 08:58.667
they turned into pancakes.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.166
- They deflated.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.033
- One was droopy,
and then one looked bigger,

09:02.066 --> 09:04.033
so he said
I should get a lift.

09:04.066 --> 09:05.700
- Okay, makes sense.

09:05.734 --> 09:07.700
- That didn't turn out well
at all.

09:07.734 --> 09:10.700
That's when they start getting,
like, a little bent in.

09:10.734 --> 09:12.567
- Okay, so scar tissue formed.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.000
It sucked the lower portion
of the breast tissue in.

09:16.066 --> 09:17.567
- Right, I said, "Let me
just get rid of them,"

09:17.600 --> 09:20.033
thinking that,
"Oh, I'm gonna go back

09:20.066 --> 09:22.667
to my 32As
or at least something normal."

09:22.734 --> 09:24.467
And that's
what didn't happen.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.734
- Sometimes when you take
the implant out,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.533
it induces the immune system

09:28.600 --> 09:31.033
to continue
the contraction process

09:31.066 --> 09:33.633
and can actually make it look
even worse.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.700
- So did you go see
any plastic surgeons

09:35.734 --> 09:36.734
about possibly fixing them?

09:36.767 --> 09:38.433
- Yes, I did.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.500
The main problem was,
I was overweight.

09:40.533 --> 09:42.600
I was over 282 pounds.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.200
- But, Chanel, you are not
100 pounds overweight.

09:44.233 --> 09:45.767
- Oh, no, most definitely.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.233
- So what happened?
How'd you lose the weight?

09:47.266 --> 09:48.500
- I just got up one day
and said,

09:48.533 --> 09:49.667
"I'm gonna start walking."

09:49.734 --> 09:52.533
And that was
over 2 1/2 years ago.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.700
- So that was good
for your head

09:53.767 --> 09:55.266
and good for your body.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.467
- Chanel is
an incredible person.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.000
I mean, imagine yourself.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.700
You start walking,
just brisk walking,

10:00.767 --> 10:02.200
and you lose all that weight,

10:02.233 --> 10:03.667
and you feel better
about yourself.

10:03.734 --> 10:05.600
She deserves help.

10:05.633 --> 10:07.767
- Let's get down
to the real meat of it, though.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.133
What are your goals?

10:09.200 --> 10:10.767
- It doesn't have to be perfect.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.667
I don't care about scars.

10:12.734 --> 10:14.567
I just want
to look normal again.

10:14.633 --> 10:15.600
- For her to be Chanel.

10:15.633 --> 10:16.767
- What's Chanel like?

10:17.000 --> 10:18.166
- She's just
the life of the party.

10:18.233 --> 10:19.567
Chanel's always been outgoing,

10:19.633 --> 10:21.600
and with everything
that's happened,

10:21.633 --> 10:23.166
all the surgeries,
it changed her.

10:23.233 --> 10:24.767
She became a hermit.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.266
I've known Chanel
since we were little kids,

10:27.300 --> 10:31.533
so I know the vibrant Chanel
that the world is missing,

10:31.567 --> 10:33.033
that I've missed.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.200
- I want to be like...

10:34.266 --> 10:36.100
- Exactl--
that's Chanel.

10:36.133 --> 10:37.233
This is the per--
that right there.

10:37.266 --> 10:39.000
- Is that right?
- That's her.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.600
- Once my breasts are fixed,
I'm flashing everyone.

10:41.667 --> 10:45.100
- The only way to figure out
if your problem is even fixable

10:45.133 --> 10:48.500
is to go in there and see
what the soft tissue's like.

10:48.533 --> 10:50.000
All right,
let's go have a look.

10:50.033 --> 10:51.767
- All righty.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.166
- This was a doctor

10:53.233 --> 10:56.000
that came out on
a very popular show back then.

10:56.033 --> 11:00.600
- Never trust a doctor
who is on a television show.

11:01.633 --> 11:03.000
[laughs]
- It's a joke.

11:03.033 --> 11:04.700
- If we put an implant
in there,

11:04.734 --> 11:08.567
in time, your immune system
could react to the implant

11:08.600 --> 11:09.734
and form scar tissue.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.233
It's unpredictable.

11:17.700 --> 11:20.000
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

11:20.033 --> 11:22.667
- Hello again.

11:22.700 --> 11:25.033
- Chanel.
- Yes.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.200
- So let's--

11:26.266 --> 11:27.300
- I'm ready.
- I'm ready.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.000
- All right.
- Okay.

11:29.033 --> 11:31.400
Just looking at your
overall breast tissue,

11:31.433 --> 11:34.133
you actually have good amount
of breast tissue,

11:34.166 --> 11:36.033
and you have good
soft tissue thickness.

11:36.066 --> 11:37.133
That's very good.

11:37.166 --> 11:38.734
And the tissue's
very lax.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.533
It really depends
upon what we can do

11:41.567 --> 11:44.033
with that nipple
and the nipple position.

11:44.066 --> 11:46.200
Chanel's nipples are very close

11:46.233 --> 11:47.433
to the bottom of the breast,

11:47.467 --> 11:49.000
and the reason they're so close

11:49.066 --> 11:51.133
is because scar tissue
has formed,

11:51.200 --> 11:53.300
which is tethering the nipples.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.734
In order to move the nipples up,

11:54.767 --> 11:56.467
you have to release
that scar tissue,

11:56.500 --> 11:59.166
and when you do that,
you disrupt the blood supply,

11:59.200 --> 12:01.066
and it can lead you
to a problem.

12:01.100 --> 12:03.066
If I can get the nipple
up here, though,

12:03.100 --> 12:05.066
and bring this in here
like this,

12:05.100 --> 12:07.734
without an implant, this is
about the size of your breast...

12:07.767 --> 12:09.033
- Okay.

12:09.066 --> 12:10.200
- Which, you know,

12:10.233 --> 12:13.433
the advantage
of not using an implant

12:13.467 --> 12:17.233
is that the chance of
the breast tissue overreacting

12:17.300 --> 12:19.467
and changing shape post-op
is minimized.

12:19.500 --> 12:23.166
If we put an implant in there,
we will get a fuller breast,

12:23.200 --> 12:27.333
but there lies the chance
that in time,

12:27.367 --> 12:29.367
your immune system
could react to the implant

12:29.400 --> 12:31.333
and form scar tissue.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.767
It's unpredictable.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.000
Every individual's
immune system and body

12:35.066 --> 12:36.266
reacts differently.

12:36.333 --> 12:38.233
You've heard the options.

12:38.266 --> 12:41.066
You need to tell us
where your head's at.

12:44.066 --> 12:45.333
- I want to go with the implant.

12:45.367 --> 12:46.600
- You do.

12:46.633 --> 12:49.100
What I do like is,
it's been so long,

12:49.133 --> 12:52.200
the tissue is so chill now,
that it's ready.

12:52.233 --> 12:54.533
I mean, this is about as ready
as it's ever gonna be,

12:54.600 --> 12:57.500
and you are clearly as ready
as you're ever gonna be.

12:57.533 --> 12:59.467
- This is just gonna push me

12:59.500 --> 13:02.367
to want to be even more outgoing
as I was before.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.200
I'm ready for this change.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.033
- I think this is
a good time to do it.

13:06.100 --> 13:07.333
All right,
let's make this work.

13:07.367 --> 13:08.500
Awesome.
I look forward to it.

it belongs
in a bad telenovela.

13:21.133 --> 13:24.567
Growing up, I would hear
that my nose was

13:24.633 --> 13:27.533
a bit crooked
and that I had my dad's nose.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.033
And it was unfortunate that
I didn't get my mom's nose,

I would look a lot better

13:53.200 --> 13:55.300
if I had Marlene Favela's nose.

when I decided

13:58.700 --> 14:00.433
to get a nose job,

14:00.467 --> 14:03.400

that I've always wanted.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.266
About three months later
after surgery,

14:14.300 --> 14:17.300
I felt what I thought
was a booger,

14:17.333 --> 14:20.300
and I dug in there,

14:20.333 --> 14:23.667
and the piece of implant
from my left side came out.

a lot of picking.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.667
At first, I was confused.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.300
I was shocked.

14:30.333 --> 14:34.467
Once I realized
that that was an implant,

14:34.500 --> 14:36.500
of course I was curious to see

14:36.567 --> 14:38.066
if there was anything
on the right side,

14:38.100 --> 14:40.567
and sure enough,
the right-side implant

14:40.600 --> 14:42.300
was also sticking out,

14:42.333 --> 14:44.200
so I went ahead
and pulled that one as well.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.433
My implants came out,

14:45.467 --> 14:47.467

for a revision.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.700
The second surgery
didn't go well.

the tip of my nose.

14:55.467 --> 14:58.066
I felt uglier now.

14:58.100 --> 15:01.433
Two years later, I went
and I saw another doctor.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.633
He said he could definitely
make it better,

15:03.700 --> 15:07.600
but he broke more
of this area here,

15:07.633 --> 15:12.100
so now I have a pointy nose
but a smaller nose

15:12.166 --> 15:15.333

15:55.233 --> 15:56.400

15:56.433 --> 15:57.400
I don't see the nose.

15:57.467 --> 16:00.266
But I do notice
that when I look at it,

it is crooked, and it does
look like it's collapsing.

16:04.633 --> 16:07.500

for it to get worse.

16:07.533 --> 16:09.400

16:09.433 --> 16:11.400
to make my nose look

16:29.700 --> 16:31.400

went in there

16:31.433 --> 16:33.567
and took as much cartilage
and as much bone

16:33.633 --> 16:35.133

he could take away,

and that's what's
most important to me.

16:59.033 --> 17:00.567
- Can you give us
a little history

17:00.600 --> 17:02.300
of what's happening
and what happened to you?

17:02.333 --> 17:05.400
- I was young, in high school,
when I decided

17:05.433 --> 17:07.633
that I wanted
my nose changed.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.300
And this was a doctor
that came out

17:10.333 --> 17:12.266
on a very popular show
back then.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.734
- Oh, so you saw him
on a TV show.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.400
- Yes.

17:16.433 --> 17:17.734
- Let me give you
a piece of advice.

17:18.000 --> 17:22.533
Never trust a doctor
who is on a television show.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.333
[laughs]
- It's a joke.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.567
[laughter]
Get up and leave.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.567
- Just kidding.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.266
My advice for anyone considering
doing plastic surgery

17:34.333 --> 17:36.734
from someone they've seen
on a television show

17:36.767 --> 17:39.700
is to avoid the short one
and go for the tall one.

17:39.734 --> 17:40.734
- We went ahead,
we did it,

17:40.767 --> 17:42.567
and everything looked good.

17:42.600 --> 17:46.367
I remember laying in bed
watching TV

17:46.433 --> 17:49.166
when I felt what I thought
was a booger.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.433
I began to dig in there.

17:51.467 --> 17:55.000
As I'm digging, I'm just feeling
that something's popping out.

17:55.066 --> 17:57.767
I pull it out,
and it's the implant

17:58.033 --> 17:59.533
from my left side of my nose.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.333
- So he put something inside
this part of the nose

18:02.367 --> 18:03.633
to lift it up?
- Yes.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.734
After that happened,
I went and I looked

18:06.767 --> 18:09.233
on my other side of my nostril

18:09.266 --> 18:10.467
to see if anything was there,

18:10.500 --> 18:12.600
and sure enough.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.500
So I pulled that one out too.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.333
- So there's a piece
of silicone on each side?

18:16.367 --> 18:17.600
- Yes.

18:17.633 --> 18:18.600
- And it popped out
of your nose.

18:18.633 --> 18:20.266
- Yes.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.767
- What rhinoplasty surgeon
in their right mind

18:23.000 --> 18:27.767
would use a nasal strut
when they have good cartilage?

18:28.000 --> 18:30.500
Use cartilage.
Don't use a foreign body.

18:30.533 --> 18:31.700
- Saw the doctor.

18:31.767 --> 18:34.066
He said, you know,
"Sometimes your body

18:34.100 --> 18:36.400
just doesn't accept implants."

18:36.467 --> 18:38.600
So he said, "We're gonna
give it another try."

18:38.633 --> 18:43.233
I went in for my second surgery,
which wasn't a good idea.

18:43.266 --> 18:47.100
So after that happened, I went
and I got another surgery.

18:47.133 --> 18:51.367
And my nose just
pretty much, like--

18:51.400 --> 18:52.667
- Collapsed.
- Started collapsing.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.433
- Yes.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.433
- So you support Marlene, then,
having another surgery.

18:57.500 --> 18:58.700
- Yeah, I do.

18:58.767 --> 19:02.367
I do, because I want her
to feel as beautiful

19:02.400 --> 19:04.367
as we believe she looks,
you know.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.633
- Let us do a fantastic,
detailed examination of you.

19:07.667 --> 19:09.000
Okay?
- Okay.

19:09.033 --> 19:11.000
- Let's go do that.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.633
- Did you vote
for Donald Trump?

19:12.667 --> 19:14.100
- Of course I did.

19:14.133 --> 19:15.367
- So you're happy
he's president.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.367
- Super, yeah.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.400
This is what our country needed.

19:19.000 --> 19:21.033
- There is no tissue plane.

19:21.100 --> 19:24.567

in a cosmetic breast case.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.767
This isn't a high-risk case;

19:26.033 --> 19:27.767
this might be
an impossible case.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.533
- ♪ I wanna be perfect ♪

19:35.567 --> 19:38.233

your nose.

19:38.300 --> 19:41.367
Yeah, it's got that notch
right there.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.500
- Yeah, it's retracted,
scarred down.

19:43.567 --> 19:45.200
- I mean, even the sides
are pulled up.

19:45.266 --> 19:47.000
We may be Marlene's last chance

19:47.033 --> 19:49.300
of fixing her nose
before it collapses.

19:49.333 --> 19:51.400
I just hope
that her previous surgeries

19:51.433 --> 19:54.233
have not caused
irreversible damage.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.433
That's a piece of cartilage,
all right.

19:56.467 --> 19:58.567
So when did you notice
that bump?

19:58.600 --> 20:00.233
- After the third surgery.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.533
- What did the surgeon say
when you said,

20:01.567 --> 20:04.000
"Hey, what's going on
with this bump?"

20:04.033 --> 20:08.567
- He said, "We can try
to pretty much, like,

20:08.600 --> 20:10.066
"sand it down.

20:10.100 --> 20:11.533
We can go
for a fourth surgery."

20:11.600 --> 20:13.467
But I was too afraid to.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.066
- Whenever there's
an irregularity

20:15.100 --> 20:17.166
or a bump after a rhinoplasty,

20:17.200 --> 20:20.300
it could be due to either
a foreign body.

20:20.333 --> 20:23.266
It could be due
to scar tissue.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.400
Or it could be due to cartilage
that was missed

20:25.467 --> 20:27.400
at the time of the operation.

20:27.467 --> 20:29.033
- So what is involved here

20:29.066 --> 20:31.133
is pretty much
stripping down everything.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.033
It's different
from the other surgeries.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.333
This is rebuilding,
reconstructing.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.066
- I'm ready for it.

20:38.100 --> 20:39.400
- But you're scared.

20:39.467 --> 20:41.533
- But I'm a little nervous,
yes.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.300
I realized there was a risk,

20:43.333 --> 20:46.000
but whatever it takes
to rebuild my nose

20:46.066 --> 20:48.233

Hi, Doctor.
- Chanel.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.233
- Hello.

21:42.266 --> 21:44.100
- How are you?
- I'm good.

21:44.133 --> 21:45.066
- You are?
- Yes.

21:45.133 --> 21:46.500
- Are you nervous?

21:46.533 --> 21:48.200
- Yup, but I'm in your hands,
so I'm good.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.367
- Today what we're gonna do
is breast implants

21:50.400 --> 21:53.066
and some kind of rearrangement
of the tissue.

21:53.133 --> 21:56.033
One of the biggest
potential problems with Chanel

21:56.100 --> 21:57.600
is the fact that the nipple

21:57.667 --> 21:59.333
is so attached
to the chest wall.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.633
If I can't get it up

22:00.667 --> 22:03.600
and allow an implant
to be put underneath it,

22:03.667 --> 22:05.500
it just won't work.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.200
For Chanel's surgery,

22:07.266 --> 22:08.233
I will start
by making incisions

22:08.266 --> 22:10.333
through her previous
areolar scars.

22:10.400 --> 22:13.367
Next, I will release the nipple
and remaining breast tissue

22:13.433 --> 22:15.266
from the chest wall
to create a pocket

22:15.300 --> 22:18.266
and shape the lower portion
of her breast mounds.

22:18.300 --> 22:21.266
I will then insert two
appropriately sized implants

22:21.300 --> 22:23.467
and elevate her nipples
into the proper position

22:23.533 --> 22:25.300
using a lollipop lift.

22:25.333 --> 22:26.667
All right, so the first thing
we're going to do

22:26.700 --> 22:28.633
is basically an exploration.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.700
We're going to make an incision

22:29.734 --> 22:31.367
in the lower part of her areola

22:31.433 --> 22:33.667
and see how difficult it is
to free up this tissue

22:33.700 --> 22:35.266
to the chest wall.

22:35.300 --> 22:36.667
This is the most challenging
part, probably,

22:36.700 --> 22:38.400
of our operation right here,

22:38.433 --> 22:41.233
and it's pretty scarred up
in here.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.633
It's hard to identify
any normal anatomy in there.

22:43.700 --> 22:46.166
Now that I'm inside
of Chanel's breasts,

22:46.200 --> 22:47.667
I realize that there's
a lot of scar,

22:47.700 --> 22:50.367
and the blood supply
is actually questionable.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.500
This is not a good sign.

22:52.567 --> 22:56.266
So, basically,
there is no tissue plane.

22:56.333 --> 23:00.400
You just have to create
a pocket within scar tissue.

23:00.467 --> 23:02.533
It's all just completely
fused together

23:02.600 --> 23:05.400
into one scarified mess.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.467
Normally when you remove
breast implants,

23:07.500 --> 23:09.667
you go back in there
and you can see

23:09.734 --> 23:11.567
where the breast implants were.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.400
There's a capsule and a pocket
inside of the capsule.

23:14.467 --> 23:16.166
Chanel's breast tissue

23:16.200 --> 23:18.367
has been entirely replaced
with scar.

23:18.433 --> 23:20.300
It's like breast hell.

23:20.333 --> 23:23.600
I've never seen this before
in a cosmetic breast case.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.400
This isn't a high-risk case;

23:25.467 --> 23:27.300
this might be
an impossible case.

23:28.567 --> 23:30.166
- I've had 13 surgeries.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.600
- My God.
- In what period of time?

23:31.633 --> 23:33.200
- And I was so pretty before,

23:33.233 --> 23:34.600
but I'm just
more elegant now.

23:34.633 --> 23:36.233
This is what I represent
to the world,

23:36.266 --> 23:37.700
and it's gonna be perfection.

23:37.767 --> 23:40.166
And "beauty is important,"
just as brains.

23:45.734 --> 23:48.033

23:51.233 --> 23:53.300
Right now, it doesn't look

23:53.367 --> 23:55.066
like she's gonna be able
to get breast implants.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.300
The only other time
I've actually seen

23:57.367 --> 23:59.066
breast tissue like Chanel's

23:59.100 --> 24:02.166
is when breasts have been
replaced by cancer.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.600
So this is
a very scary situation

24:04.633 --> 24:07.233
and one which does not have
an easy solution.

24:07.266 --> 24:09.200
It's a concrete pocket,

24:09.233 --> 24:13.467
basically one made
out of scar and nothing more.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.467
Let's put a sizer in
to see where we're at.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.633
So if we could get
a 400 cc implant in her,

24:18.667 --> 24:20.200
that would give her
probably a mid-D.

24:20.266 --> 24:22.233
I can usually complete
a breast surgery

24:22.266 --> 24:24.233
in between two to four hours.

24:24.266 --> 24:27.233
Chanel's case is so
extraordinarily difficult

24:27.266 --> 24:30.000
that I'm nowhere near the end
of this procedure.

24:30.033 --> 24:33.333
What happens if I did this?

24:33.400 --> 24:35.633
It's starting to sort of look
like a breast, isn't it?

24:35.667 --> 24:37.266
Let me see
what the left side looks like.

24:37.300 --> 24:39.633
Do you have a medium-profile 420
or something, a 425?

24:39.667 --> 24:41.100
- Mm-hmm.

24:41.133 --> 24:43.100
- One that matches
the profile of this?

24:43.133 --> 24:46.533
Typically, there's what we call
the second-side phenomenon,

24:46.567 --> 24:48.633
because you've worked
on the first side,

24:48.667 --> 24:52.066
and you sort of learn the
individual patient's anatomy,

24:52.133 --> 24:54.000
so the second side
is much easier.

24:54.033 --> 24:56.000
In Chanel's case, though,

24:56.033 --> 24:58.133
it's tremendously
more difficult.

24:58.166 --> 24:59.767
That's very unusual

25:00.033 --> 25:02.266
and, actually, very daunting.

25:02.300 --> 25:03.667
Well, I'm essentially
cutting out

25:03.700 --> 25:05.667
the lower part
of the breast tissue,

25:05.700 --> 25:09.133
which is not very good
blood supply anyway.

25:09.166 --> 25:11.667
I mean, are we committing
ourselves to this lift,

25:11.700 --> 25:13.367
which puts everything
at risk

25:13.433 --> 25:16.767
but without which she will have
no real breast shape?

25:17.033 --> 25:18.633
- I think Chanel
would say yes.

25:18.700 --> 25:20.667
- As much as I don't want
to do a lift

25:20.700 --> 25:23.233
because of the lack
of blood supply,

25:23.300 --> 25:25.100
she absolutely needs a lift

25:25.166 --> 25:28.300
in order to give her
good shape and symmetry.

25:28.333 --> 25:31.100
Let's cut all the tissue
around the areola

25:31.166 --> 25:32.300
and bring it up,

25:32.333 --> 25:34.100
and hopefully
this nipple stays alive.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.367
This was
an extraordinarily difficult

25:37.433 --> 25:40.166
and--I'm gonna say it--
weird case.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.734
The entire breast
was encased in scarring.

25:43.767 --> 25:45.400
There was no evidence

25:45.467 --> 25:47.166
that there'd even been
an implant in there,

25:47.200 --> 25:51.133
just a massive foreign body
scar response everywhere.

some pop star.

26:35.100 --> 26:36.633

an actress.

Ivanka has

This is what our country needed.

28:06.233 --> 28:08.400

have you had?

28:08.433 --> 28:10.100

28:10.166 --> 28:11.400
- Oh, my God.
- In what period of time?

28:11.433 --> 28:13.100
- And I was so pretty before,

28:13.166 --> 28:14.400
but I'm just
more elegant now.

28:14.433 --> 28:16.266
Um, almost a year.

28:16.300 --> 28:19.400
- Were you put under anesthesia
13 times in the last year?

28:19.433 --> 28:22.233
- No, three.
- Oh, okay.

28:22.300 --> 28:23.400
So multiple operations
done at once.

28:23.433 --> 28:24.400
- Correct.

28:24.433 --> 28:26.033
- In plastic surgery,

28:26.066 --> 28:28.166
sometimes we do
multiple procedures.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.467
Now, they may be small,

28:29.500 --> 28:32.734
but you can have
up to five or six procedures

28:32.767 --> 28:37.133
at one time
as long as it's safe.

like that?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.333
That is so funny.
[laughs]

28:40.367 --> 28:44.300
- Well, as--I'm pondering
this conversation for a minute,

28:44.333 --> 28:46.700
and I'm trying to figure out,
why would you want to do

28:46.734 --> 28:51.000
that much of a transformation
that quick?

28:51.066 --> 28:52.433
- Are you married?

28:52.467 --> 28:54.300
- No.
- You're single.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.033
- I was married
for, like, ten years.

28:56.066 --> 28:57.300
- Oh, really?
- But now I'm single.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.166
- How long after you broke up

28:59.200 --> 29:00.533
did you start having
these surgeries?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.433
- Like, four to five months.

29:02.467 --> 29:06.066
- It is very common for people
after a traumatic event

29:06.100 --> 29:07.400
or a breakup

29:07.467 --> 29:10.033
to come in and want
to have plastic surgery.

29:10.100 --> 29:11.166
But you have to be
very careful

29:11.233 --> 29:13.033
with those individuals

29:13.100 --> 29:14.433
that they're doing it
for the right reasons

29:14.500 --> 29:17.300
and that they don't have
unrealistic expectations.

29:17.367 --> 29:19.300
That can be a real red flag.

29:19.367 --> 29:21.066
Unfortunately, now you have
some problems with that.

29:21.100 --> 29:22.467
Which ones have been
a problem?

29:22.500 --> 29:25.033
- My nose, there's, like,
going back to fix the bump.

29:25.100 --> 29:26.567
And then there's another bump.

29:26.633 --> 29:29.066
And then every time
I get my wax done,

29:29.100 --> 29:30.467
they're like,
"What happened here?"

29:30.500 --> 29:32.233
- Just out of curiosity,
in the future,

29:32.266 --> 29:34.066
what more
do you plan on having?

29:34.100 --> 29:36.066
- This, this, and this, really.

29:36.100 --> 29:37.033
- So this is it, then.

29:37.100 --> 29:38.500
So you want to actually have us

29:38.533 --> 29:40.166

29:40.233 --> 29:41.433

- Yay.

29:41.500 --> 29:43.433
- So why don't we go
in the exam room?

29:43.500 --> 29:45.433
Obviously,

That's unnatural.

30:45.600 --> 30:48.533
Okay, your septum

30:48.567 --> 30:51.567
And it may actually affect
her breathing.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.300
Let's talk about your nose.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.533
First of all,
you just had a surgery

30:54.567 --> 30:55.633
three, four months ago.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.133
You keep going back
on your nose,

30:57.166 --> 30:58.400
you're gonna cause
some serious damage.

30:58.433 --> 31:00.400
First of all, you have
to let the nose heal

31:00.433 --> 31:01.633
about a good year.

31:01.700 --> 31:04.533
So we're gonna kind of
urge you not to,

31:04.567 --> 31:06.367
because this looks great
on you right now.

31:06.433 --> 31:08.233
- I know I have a great nose.

31:08.300 --> 31:09.700
But improving
is super important,

31:09.734 --> 31:11.400
and we should all improve
ourselves.

31:11.433 --> 31:13.266
And I'm not gonna stop
until I get it.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.166
- Your incisions are different

31:15.200 --> 31:16.700
for your upper eyelids
on both sides.

31:16.734 --> 31:19.133
But this one is more visible;
it's a little red line.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.734
- Yeah, it looks like
a wrinkle.

31:20.767 --> 31:22.200
- And that one,
for the red line,

31:22.233 --> 31:23.400
you could just even laser.

31:23.467 --> 31:24.567
- Really?
- You can just laser

31:24.600 --> 31:26.300
that little red line,
if you want.

31:26.333 --> 31:28.700
Tiffany does not need
an invasive procedure.

31:28.734 --> 31:31.533
All she needs to do
is go to the dermatologist,

31:31.600 --> 31:34.300
maybe have a laser
to get the scar to go away,

31:34.333 --> 31:36.200
or maybe just give it time
to heal.

31:36.233 --> 31:38.266
It's only been a few months.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.300
- If you have more
plastic surgery,

31:40.333 --> 31:43.166
the chances that you run into
a significant complication

31:43.200 --> 31:45.133
are yuuuuge.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.700
- Ooh.
[laughs]

31:46.734 --> 31:48.633
- That was good.
I liked the way you said that.

31:48.700 --> 31:49.700
- Yuge.

31:49.734 --> 31:51.433
My suggestion for Tiffany

31:51.467 --> 31:54.567
is to forget about trying
to look like Ivanka Trump.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.567
Go home, relax,
take a beat,

31:57.633 --> 32:00.567
and maybe think about doing this
some time in the future--

32:00.633 --> 32:02.734
maybe, I don't know,
in four years?

32:02.767 --> 32:04.300
Plastic surgery
has evolved

32:04.367 --> 32:05.300
to a much more natural look.

32:05.367 --> 32:06.600
I think you're there.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.333
- I mean, you don't need
anything right now.

32:08.367 --> 32:10.500
- Your journey to look
like Ivanka Trump is over.

32:10.533 --> 32:12.734
- Oh, just stop it.
I'm Tiffany Trump.

32:12.767 --> 32:14.467
- You're Tiffany Trump.

33:09.667 --> 33:11.333
The little things

33:20.300 --> 33:21.633
Okay?
- You got it.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.433
- Because they have to get
new blood supply.

33:23.467 --> 33:25.367
Any time you're doing
revision surgery,

33:25.433 --> 33:27.266
the blood supply
gets compromised,

33:34.300 --> 33:36.133
No matter how good
of a job I do,

33:36.166 --> 33:39.367
the healing is something
that I can't control.

33:39.433 --> 33:40.767
For Marlene's surgery,

33:41.033 --> 33:42.667
I'll take composite grafts
from both ears

33:42.700 --> 33:44.500
while my team harvests rib.

33:44.567 --> 33:46.233
I will then open up her nose,

33:46.300 --> 33:48.367
rebuild the dorsum
with rib cartilage

33:48.433 --> 33:49.767
while removing the cartilage
causing the bump

33:50.033 --> 33:51.667
on the left side of her nose.

33:51.700 --> 33:53.767
Then we'll finish
by using composite grafts

33:54.033 --> 33:56.633
to lower her nostrils,
hopefully giving Marlene

33:56.700 --> 33:59.033
the telenovela nose
she's always wanted.

33:59.066 --> 34:00.467
I'm gonna start
the composite grafts

34:00.500 --> 34:02.033
while you start the ribs.

34:02.066 --> 34:06.266
You know, with this being
her fourth surgery,

34:06.333 --> 34:09.533
it'll be interesting to see
how much scar tissue I find

34:09.600 --> 34:11.000
when I open up this nose.

34:11.066 --> 34:12.567
I'm already feeling resistance,

34:12.600 --> 34:15.700
so there might be
a good amount of scar tissue.

34:15.734 --> 34:17.567
- The rib is gonna come out.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.000
- Okay, so the rib's coming out?

34:20.066 --> 34:21.333
- Rib.
- Let's see it.

34:21.367 --> 34:23.400
Oh, that's a nice rib.
- Yeah.

34:23.467 --> 34:25.266
- Look at that.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.667
It's always better
to use your own tissue.

34:26.734 --> 34:28.567
Rib perichondrium
is the best source,

34:28.600 --> 34:29.700
best way to go.

34:29.734 --> 34:32.033
Now I'm gonna start
the rhinoplasty.

34:32.066 --> 34:34.400
A lot of scar tissue.

34:34.467 --> 34:35.734
We have to be
really cautious here,

34:35.767 --> 34:39.567
because the skin
is extremely thin.

34:39.600 --> 34:44.033
Go, go, go.

34:44.100 --> 34:47.066
Okay, that was kind of, like,
a nice crunch.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.567
Scary but good.

34:48.633 --> 34:50.600
Hold on; we got
a big, big spur coming out.

34:50.633 --> 34:52.433
Let me see.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.066
We got a lot of blood
around that spur.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.700
Yeah, this one's really stuck
to the tissue.

34:57.767 --> 34:59.467
- It's crazy.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.700
- Ah.
- That looks crazy.

35:02.767 --> 35:04.600
- That's probably one of
the biggest spurs I've seen.

35:04.633 --> 35:06.433
Look at this thing.

35:06.500 --> 35:07.767
You know, since Marlene
didn't have any trauma,

35:08.000 --> 35:09.500
it appears

35:09.533 --> 35:12.433
that she was born
with this gigantic septal spur,

35:12.500 --> 35:15.734
which is a piece of bone
in her left nasal airway.

35:15.767 --> 35:17.567
The biggest thing, though,
was the doctor,

35:17.633 --> 35:19.567
for some reason,
either didn't see it--

35:19.633 --> 35:21.433
which it's right in front
of him--

35:21.500 --> 35:23.734
or just chose to ignore it
because it was too difficult.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.467

42:14.700 --> 42:16.667
But I need you all to know
when I go out,

42:16.700 --> 42:18.467
I'm gonna be showing
these titties

42:18.533 --> 42:20.200
every time I go.

42:20.266 --> 42:22.433
So just be ready.
Just be ready.

42:22.467 --> 42:25.400
- Chanel is so back
in full effect.

42:25.467 --> 42:28.233
Vacation, flashing.
At the pool, flashing.

42:28.300 --> 42:29.633
Beach, flashing.

42:29.700 --> 42:31.500
She's gonna be
all over the place.

42:31.567 --> 42:33.300
Since you have new titties,

42:33.333 --> 42:34.433
you can take a bite
out of these.

42:34.467 --> 42:36.400
[laughter]

42:36.467 --> 42:38.233
- I'm gonna take a bite
off the bottom,

42:38.300 --> 42:40.166
'cause I didn't have
no lower breast tissue.

42:40.200 --> 42:43.633
[laughter]

42:43.700 --> 42:45.700
Before my surgery,
my breasts were dented in

42:45.734 --> 42:47.633
because they were done
on a discount,

42:47.700 --> 42:50.667
and I would cry whenever
I saw myself in the mirror.

42:50.734 --> 42:52.433
Now, thanks to Dr. Dubrow,

42:52.467 --> 42:54.533
I have full titties
that are round,

42:54.600 --> 42:56.567
and I'll show them off
to anyone.

42:56.600 --> 42:59.300
I just want to say to anyone
who might be out there

42:59.333 --> 43:00.700
that's depressed,

43:00.734 --> 43:02.500
sitting in their house
with their blinds closed,

43:02.533 --> 43:04.700
get outside, put on
some tennis shoes, and walk.

43:04.767 --> 43:06.433
It will change your life.

43:06.500 --> 43:09.433
This is before Dr. Dubrow,
and this is after.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.567
[laughter]

43:11.633 --> 43:14.266
I'm so happy.
Ahh!

43:14.333 --> 43:15.333
[laughter and applause]

43:15.367 --> 43:16.333
♪ ♪

43:16.367 --> 43:17.633
- Basically, what it is

43:17.667 --> 43:20.200
is to look like a male fantasy.

43:20.233 --> 43:21.233
I want to look
like a [bleep] doll,

43:21.266 --> 43:23.433
but I don't want to be
a [bleep] doll.

43:24.367 --> 43:25.400
- My nose is crooked as [bleep].

43:25.467 --> 43:27.200
I have
an identical twin brother.

43:27.233 --> 43:28.667
I want to look
like brothers again.

43:28.734 --> 43:30.467
- Your nose is [indistinct].
- I guess you're next.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.600
- Whoa!
We got a little bleeder here.

43:31.633 --> 43:32.667
- Whoa.

43:32.734 --> 43:34.233
- After six surgeries,

43:34.266 --> 43:36.133
I am left with what I call
"chesticles."

43:36.200 --> 43:37.266
- Oh, boy.

43:37.333 --> 43:38.333
- How's our airway pressure?

43:38.367 --> 43:39.734
[beeping]
- Oh, hold on.

43:39.767 --> 43:41.300
- We're in serious trouble.

43:41.367 --> 43:42.400
Ugh!
