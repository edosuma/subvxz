WEBVTT

00:05.570 --> 00:08.791
Did you know that the sea air
is a natural antihistamine?

00:08.878 --> 00:12.621
The salt clears the passages.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.449
- Hey, Cho.
- What do we got?

00:14.536 --> 00:16.842
Alton Creek. He's a big-time
divorce attorney.

00:16.929 --> 00:19.367
It's hard to say which one
of his many enemies

00:19.454 --> 00:20.542
would want him dead.

00:20.629 --> 00:21.847
His speedboat's down there.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.110
Cause of death?

00:23.197 --> 00:24.763
Well, he's not
dead yet.

00:24.850 --> 00:26.809
Somebody just threatened
to make him that way.

00:26.896 --> 00:29.116
Threatened? Since when do
we roll for death threats?

00:29.203 --> 00:32.162
When the threatened man
is a rich establishment lawyer

00:32.249 --> 00:33.250
with juice.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.730
This one's on you, Cho.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.036
Apparently one of your

00:36.123 --> 00:38.212
confidential informants
knows reek.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.865
She told him we could help.

00:39.952 --> 00:41.041
- Summer.
- Uh-huh.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.564
Summer?
That's a nice name.

00:42.651 --> 00:45.654
She's a working girl.
Been a C.I. for a few weeks.

00:45.741 --> 00:47.656
Surprised she knows
a high-end guy like Creek.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.484
She's moving up.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.181
[Creek]
'Where are you?'

00:51.268 --> 00:53.792
Hi. Yeah. Uh, Mr. Creek,
w-we're walking to you now.

00:53.879 --> 00:55.446
[Creek]
'You're late.'

00:55.533 --> 00:57.100
It's a long drive
from Sacramento.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.233
We got here as soon
as we could.

00:59.320 --> 01:01.496
That's it? Moron, someone's
trying to kill me.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.064
And the CBI needs to do
something about these threats

01:04.151 --> 01:06.588
or I will call my good friend,
the attorney general..

01:06.675 --> 01:08.590
[explosion]

01:20.254 --> 01:23.126
[theme music]

01:30.133 --> 01:32.918
[crackling and whooshing]

01:46.845 --> 01:48.325
- Uh..
- His leg?

01:49.674 --> 01:51.763
Was that a shark?

01:55.463 --> 01:57.639
So much for
professional courtesy.

02:01.904 --> 02:04.254
[Rigsby]
So forensics finished
their search of the water

02:04.341 --> 02:05.734
near the explosion
and confirmed

02:05.821 --> 02:07.779
that the body parts belonged
to Alton Creek.

02:07.866 --> 02:09.477
Did they... find them all?

02:09.564 --> 02:13.263
Most. And the arson squad found
traces of c-4 in the debris.

02:13.350 --> 02:14.830
Guy never knew
what hit him.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.875
At least he was dead
when, you know..

02:16.962 --> 02:18.355
...the shark ate him.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.098
Okay, um, anything else?

02:22.185 --> 02:23.708
Uh, time frame.

02:23.795 --> 02:25.623
Security cameras covering
the yacht's berth

02:25.710 --> 02:28.757
were down for repairs between 11
last night and 7 this morning.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.802
Killer had to have planted
the explosive then.

02:30.889 --> 02:32.935
- Is that luck or planning?
- Don't know yet.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.589
So who wanted this guy dead?

02:34.676 --> 02:36.156
He's a divorce attorney.
Who didn't?

02:36.243 --> 02:37.983
Does he have any family?

02:38.070 --> 02:41.552
Nope. We're trying to find his
law partner, Lawrence Dersh.

02:41.639 --> 02:43.685
He's not at any
of his three houses.

02:43.772 --> 02:45.556
[woman speaks indistinctly]

02:45.643 --> 02:48.429
Ah.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.735
Maybe Summer'll know.
I asked her to come in.

02:50.822 --> 02:53.999
Kimball Cho.
It's been a while.

02:54.086 --> 02:56.959
You're late.

02:57.046 --> 02:59.788
You know sharks can have up
to 3000 teeth?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.224
Five rows of 'em.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.487
Are you gonna actually
help on the case?

03:03.574 --> 03:06.490
'I could actually use
your help, too.'

03:06.577 --> 03:08.971
Special agent Darcy.

03:09.058 --> 03:11.495
How's the federal authorities?
I haven't seen you for, uh..

03:11.582 --> 03:13.497
Since, what..

03:13.584 --> 03:15.760
The Panzer business, right.
Actually, that's why I'm here.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.327
We just took over the case.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.373
SFPD wasn't getting
anywhere.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.853
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

03:21.940 --> 03:23.681
- Um, we're kind of--
- 'Oh, of course.'

03:23.768 --> 03:25.988
Uh, whatever you need.
Take a seat.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.555
I'll, I'll make tea.

03:30.253 --> 03:33.561
Is this an official inquiry?
Cop to confidential informant?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.302
You'll get paid.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.913
Now did Creek tell you
who wanted to kill him?

03:38.000 --> 03:40.132
Wasn't that kind
of relationship.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.612
How's your back?

03:42.744 --> 03:44.311
It's fine.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.095
Whatwas your relationship?

03:46.182 --> 03:47.705
He used to be a client.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.707
We weren't close,
but I liked him.

03:49.794 --> 03:52.101
Well, you seem to be
one of the few.

03:52.188 --> 03:56.584
Yeah, well,
Alton was...abrasive.

03:56.671 --> 03:58.760
He was a real lawyer,
you know?

03:58.847 --> 04:02.154
Wasn't really happy unless
he was arguing about something.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.853
- Girlfriend?
- New one every month.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.681
You know his law partner,
Lawrence Dersh?

04:06.768 --> 04:09.031
No, not really.
But you know what?

04:09.118 --> 04:10.946
Al was bitching
about Dersh last week

04:11.033 --> 04:13.514
said they got in a fight
over money or something.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.516
Could Dersh be the one
who threatened Creek?

04:15.603 --> 04:17.692
Maybe. I mean,
it was pretty hard-core.

04:17.779 --> 04:21.826
- You heard the threat?
- No. I saw it.

04:21.913 --> 04:23.611
We were coming back
from this party

04:23.698 --> 04:26.396
and it was sitting
on his front doorstep.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.964
A pig with a big old knife
in his head.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.054
I told him to go to the cops,
but he said no.

04:32.141 --> 04:36.188
Couple days later, he asked if
I knew any cops who were cool.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.799
I couldn't think of any

04:37.886 --> 04:40.280
so I told him
to talk to you guys.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.807
Look, Red John was
an accomplished killer

04:45.894 --> 04:49.463
no doubt, and I applaud you
for ridding us of him.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.639
But he is not
in the same league

04:51.726 --> 04:53.771
as the San Joaquin killer.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.296
'Red John was
a common sociopath..'

04:56.383 --> 04:58.515
...lazy, sloppy, delusional.

04:58.602 --> 05:01.388
'You really have no idea
what you're saying.'

05:01.475 --> 05:04.086
And only
a little while later..

05:04.173 --> 05:06.871
[tea pouring]

05:06.958 --> 05:09.091
Hmm.

05:09.178 --> 05:12.224
The man who killed Panzer wanted
it to look like Red John

05:12.312 --> 05:14.096
'whom you shot and killed
last spring.'

05:14.183 --> 05:15.445
Lapsang souchong.

05:15.532 --> 05:17.012
I think you're gonna like it.

05:17.099 --> 05:19.754
Here we go.

05:19.841 --> 05:21.843
Your point?

05:21.930 --> 05:24.149
Well, it's an odd chain
of events, isn't it?

05:24.236 --> 05:25.716
Mm.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.239
[slurps]

05:27.327 --> 05:30.765
Yeah, I guess. Odd happens.

05:30.852 --> 05:32.636
What does it matter
who killed Panzer?

05:32.723 --> 05:34.508
He was the San Joaquin killer.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.511
So you said, but I studied
Panzer very carefully.

05:37.598 --> 05:39.774
There's not a lot of evidence
to support that.

05:39.861 --> 05:41.253
Not your kind of evidence.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.994
He was the San Joaquin killer.

05:43.081 --> 05:44.779
I agree.

05:44.866 --> 05:50.001
It is possible, but his murderer
still has to be apprehended.

05:50.088 --> 05:52.526
Why?

05:52.613 --> 05:53.918
Because killing someone

05:54.005 --> 05:56.094
without government
permission is wrong?

05:56.181 --> 05:58.575
Was there something that
you wanted to ask, agent?

05:58.662 --> 06:01.752
Are you sure the man
you killed was Red John?

06:01.839 --> 06:03.624
[swallows]

06:07.018 --> 06:09.369
Yes. I'm sure.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.115
[clears throat]
Then we have a copycat.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.772
can you think of anyone
who would wanna do this?

06:21.859 --> 06:25.297
Someone that wanted to avenge
Panzer's crimes, I'd imagine.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.126
Well, who else thought that
he was the San Joaquin killer

06:28.213 --> 06:29.650
aside from you?

06:29.737 --> 06:31.086
Good question.

06:31.173 --> 06:32.914
You figure out
the answer to that

06:33.001 --> 06:34.698
I think you'll probably
have your killer.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.874
But surely the motive

06:36.961 --> 06:39.834
is to avenge the insult
to Red John, right?

06:39.921 --> 06:43.359
I mean, look at the...
the cutting patterns.

06:43.446 --> 06:44.882
Clearly, our suspect

06:44.969 --> 06:47.058
is someone who studied
Red John obsessively.

06:47.145 --> 06:50.497
Well, R-Red John..

06:50.584 --> 06:54.979
...he was the type to attract
followers, um, a-admirers.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.720
He had a particular style..

06:56.807 --> 06:59.201
...a style that people wanted
to, to copy, you know?

06:59.288 --> 07:01.943
'Not unlike Elvis.'

07:02.030 --> 07:03.335
Alright.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.599
Well, thank you
for your time.

07:05.686 --> 07:08.079
I'm staying
at the Oakview Inn.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.864
If you can think
of anything else

07:09.951 --> 07:12.388
please give me a call.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.129
Agent Lisbon.

07:18.655 --> 07:19.656
Nice lady.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.137
Nice?

07:22.224 --> 07:24.531
That's all you're gonna say?
She's nice?

07:24.618 --> 07:27.838
Great legs.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.971
[indistinct chatter]

07:30.058 --> 07:33.148
Don't you think it's time to
tell the truth about Red John?

07:44.638 --> 07:46.814
[door closes]

07:46.901 --> 07:48.859
Well, the truth is
I killed Red John.

07:48.946 --> 07:52.036
I mean, you can ask anyone.

07:52.123 --> 07:53.951
It was on the news, Lisbon.

07:54.038 --> 07:57.346
But you think he's alive.

07:57.433 --> 07:59.740
I toldyou that.

07:59.827 --> 08:02.438
You, Lisbon. Nobody else.

08:02.525 --> 08:03.874
And it's better that way.

08:03.961 --> 08:05.528
Then why make him
re-emerge?

08:05.615 --> 08:08.139
You manipulated Panzer
into insulting Red John

08:08.226 --> 08:10.098
so Red John would kill him.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.625
I didn't know how else
to stop Panzer.

08:15.712 --> 08:19.934
He would have just
kept on killing.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.458
And now you've got the FBI
asking awkward questions.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.765
You've kept this from the team.
It's not good.

08:24.852 --> 08:27.028
It's lucky they don't know,
'cause if they knew

08:27.115 --> 08:28.856
they'd have to lie,
wouldn't they?

08:28.943 --> 08:31.902
And this way, they can tell
what they think is the truth.

08:31.989 --> 08:34.035
Do you know how messed up
that sounds?

08:34.122 --> 08:35.558
Yeah.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.734
What is wrong
with the simple truth?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.649
Telling people he's alive?

08:39.736 --> 08:42.173
I told a jury
that I shot him dead.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.481
Where does that leave me?

08:48.005 --> 08:49.616
It's not good.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.009
No, no, not great.

08:55.883 --> 08:58.015
Their partner dies,
and they throw a party.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.670
Nice.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.151
Hey, so you're stranded
on a desert island

09:03.238 --> 09:05.632
with Attila the Hun,
Joseph Stalin, and a lawyer

09:05.719 --> 09:08.939
and you got a gun, with only
two bullets. What do you do?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.550
- You're telling a lawyer joke?
- Yeah.

09:10.637 --> 09:11.681
No.

09:17.339 --> 09:20.081
Lawrence Dersh.
You're a tough man to find.

09:20.168 --> 09:24.564
You're here about Alton.
Awful thing. Just awful.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.697
But business
is business, right?

09:27.784 --> 09:30.004
This is our
yearly retreat, officers.

09:30.091 --> 09:31.919
It's been scheduled for months.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.617
The employees are scared.
I have to show them that

09:34.704 --> 09:36.880
business is still strong
even with Alton gone.

09:36.967 --> 09:38.534
He'd want that, I promise you.

09:38.621 --> 09:41.624
Sir, where were you between
11 P.M. and 7 A.M.?

09:41.711 --> 09:43.887
Um, whoa. Sorry.
Flag on the play.

09:43.974 --> 09:46.411
My client won't be answering
any questions right now.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.891
Your client?

09:47.978 --> 09:51.025
Colette Santori. I work
with Larry at the firm.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.331
White-collar crime.

09:53.418 --> 09:55.246
Fast track to partnership,
right, Colette?

09:55.333 --> 09:57.248
Yeah, if you play
your cards right.

09:57.335 --> 10:02.079
No, uh, in-house dating,
Larry. Rules.

10:02.166 --> 10:04.778
Well, as you can see,
Larry's had a few

10:04.865 --> 10:06.693
and is saying
some inappropriate things.

10:06.780 --> 10:08.999
Not a good time to talk
to the police.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.784
Hey, now.

10:10.871 --> 10:14.135
But I would be happy to set up
an interview for tomorrow.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.485
Sure. No problem.
Just one thing.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.487
Who had reason
to want your partner dead?

10:18.574 --> 10:20.489
I have no idea.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.056
Like I said..

10:22.143 --> 10:24.319
'...tomorrow.'

10:24.406 --> 10:25.799
Thanks for your time.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.163
[computer chimes]

10:42.250 --> 10:44.295
What the hell?

10:44.382 --> 10:45.949
That's weird.

10:51.041 --> 10:53.304
'It's late, Grace.
What are you still doing here?'

10:53.391 --> 10:56.394
Just...had stuff to do.

Hey, take a look at this,
would you?

11:06.317 --> 11:08.885
[groans]

11:08.972 --> 11:12.106
Somebody uploaded a file
onto the major crime server.

11:12.193 --> 11:14.325
The file was transferred
from outside CBI

11:14.412 --> 11:17.851
and that's not possible.
At least it shouldn't be.

11:17.938 --> 11:20.244
That's that "I dare you" thing?

11:20.331 --> 11:22.812
Well, let's take the dare.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.771
[mouse clicks]

11:27.077 --> 11:28.949
[horn honks]

11:34.258 --> 11:37.218
- Isn't that the FBI agent?
- Darcy, yes.

11:46.314 --> 11:48.272
What is going on?

11:48.359 --> 11:49.360

[door closes]

12:11.861 --> 12:13.428

12:13.515 --> 12:15.473
Somebody just uploaded
a text file

12:15.560 --> 12:17.258
to the same folder
as the video.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.520
Open it.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.700
Uh..

12:24.787 --> 12:26.789
Oakview Inn. Oakview Inn.

12:26.876 --> 12:29.400
Quick, let's go.
Let's get outta here. Come on.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.370
[engine shuts off]

13:01.345 --> 13:03.217
- Grace, Grace, Grace.
- Alright, hold on.

13:08.396 --> 13:09.745
Don't move. Federal agent.

13:09.832 --> 13:11.312
CBI. We're friendly.
Don't shoot.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.621
Patrick?

13:16.708 --> 13:18.667
Susan.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.974
Sorry about your door.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.938
[door closes]

13:33.029 --> 13:35.075
Creepy.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.555
Looks like you're my knight in
shining armor, Patrick.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.253
Hmm.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.299
So, I go to CBI
asking about a copycat

13:42.386 --> 13:45.999
and CBI is sent this
weird stalking video of me.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.218
Panzer's killer's taken
an interest in you.

13:48.305 --> 13:51.134
It's dangerous.

13:51.221 --> 13:53.745
I-I think you should
get off the case.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.486
You should give it
to someone else.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.097
Come on.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.490
This weird video
makes me wanna

13:59.577 --> 14:01.275
go after after that creep
even harder.

14:01.362 --> 14:04.365
I, uh...this is
a dangerous situation.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.454
We're not talking about
just some peeping tom.

14:06.541 --> 14:08.717
This is a stalker. It's
a totally different pathology.

14:08.804 --> 14:10.893
Goodnight.
I can take care of myself.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.982
I appreciate
your help tonight. Thanks.

14:26.953 --> 14:31.218
That video..
It was Red John.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.611
Yes.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.703
Red John
is stalking Darcy.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.925
[sighs]

14:43.012 --> 14:44.361
Yeah.

14:44.448 --> 14:47.712
And you didn't tell her.
Are you crazy?

14:47.799 --> 14:51.064
If I told her, she, she would've
just gone harder at the case.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.066
She's not really
the type to stop.

14:53.153 --> 14:55.807
Mm. Is this
about helping Darcy

14:55.895 --> 14:57.461
or keeping Red John
for yourself?

14:57.548 --> 15:01.204
What? This is not about me.
Of course I'm worried about her.

15:03.598 --> 15:07.210
"She's cute.
This is gonna be fun."

15:07.297 --> 15:08.995
That message,
that was meant for you.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.607
Yes, that was
a message for me.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.610
Red John is trying to form
a closer relationship with you.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.177
Yeah, well,
there's no relationship.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.179
What if Red John took
murdering Panzer

15:19.266 --> 15:21.746
as some kind of invitation?

15:21.833 --> 15:23.966
You manipulated
a serial killer.

15:24.053 --> 15:25.011
There's gonna
be consequences.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.708
I didn't have a choice.

15:26.795 --> 15:28.884
I had to stop Panzer.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.412
I will try and get Darcy
off the Panzer case..

15:35.499 --> 15:38.546
...before Red John hurts her.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.156
I hope you can.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.905
You had a fight
with your partner, Alton Creek?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.341
A disagreement, agent.
Not--

15:51.428 --> 15:53.953
I'd like to hear it
from him, Ms. Santori.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.564
It was a disagreement.
Not a fight.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.566
About money?

15:58.653 --> 16:02.787
Go ahead.
You can answer.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.225
Yes, we argued over money.

16:05.312 --> 16:07.618
Some of his clients were
behind on their bills

16:07.705 --> 16:10.273
and I told Al
to get on them about it.

16:10.360 --> 16:13.059
Look, he was my partner
for 15 years.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.800
I had nothing but love
for the guy.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.107
'This is from the security
camera outside your building'

16:18.194 --> 16:19.761
'the day before Creek died.'

16:23.504 --> 16:25.158
Doesn't look much like love.

16:25.245 --> 16:28.074
What were you really
arguing about?

16:28.161 --> 16:29.597
I told you.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.121
Money.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.123
You know who
you should look at

16:34.210 --> 16:35.864
is that hooker
he hung out with.

16:35.951 --> 16:37.344
Summer Edgecombe?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.998
Summer... Autumn,
something like that.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.651
She's got
a terrible temper.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.479
If there's nothing else,
we'll get going--

16:42.566 --> 16:44.916
Just one more thing.
You lied to us yesterday.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.701
We asked if anyone
wanted Alton dead

16:46.788 --> 16:49.182
and you said no,
but wasn't that a lie.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.532
Do you know who sent this
to your partner?

16:53.664 --> 16:55.144
Did you do it?

17:01.063 --> 17:03.674
That is disgusting.

17:03.761 --> 17:06.764
And I certainly
didn't do it.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.331
Are we done here?

17:12.379 --> 17:14.250
- So?
- So I asked around.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.296
"did Dersh happen to mention
Al's little secret?"

17:16.383 --> 17:19.038
and by little, I mean big,
'cause he had to know.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.213
What secret?

17:20.300 --> 17:22.171
Cost you $1,000 to find out.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.871
Thousand dollars?

17:26.958 --> 17:29.048
And dinner
at a nice restaurant.

17:30.527 --> 17:33.052
Five hundred and a pizza.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.531
Six hundred, no mushrooms.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.446
Deal.

17:36.533 --> 17:38.405
I hate mushrooms.

17:41.538 --> 17:45.847
What can you get
for $127.68?

17:45.934 --> 17:47.631
You can go crazy
at olive garden.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.155
Not me. Creek.

17:49.242 --> 17:50.939
Van Pelt looked
into his business records

17:51.026 --> 17:52.114
and there's something weird.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.811
Up until six months ago

17:53.898 --> 17:56.901
every week, he put in
for reimbursement by his firm

17:56.988 --> 18:01.036
for $127.68 for expenses.

18:01.123 --> 18:03.560
So he was hiding whatever it is
from his partner.

18:03.647 --> 18:08.261
Yeah, but what can you
buy for $127.68?

18:08.348 --> 18:11.612
I don't know. Creek was
hiding something else.

18:11.699 --> 18:15.006
Our C.I. Found out he had a big
gambling habit. Poker, mostly.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.617
- Illegal?
- Very.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.923
San Francisco has an underground
club in the tenderloin.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.664
Creek had lost plenty lately.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.971
That could have been why
he and Dersh fought.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.539
Yeah, but a few days later,
Creek won 50 grand

18:25.626 --> 18:28.281
at Texas hold'em, which turned
out to be a bigger problem.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.892
- Why?
- He won it from Brock Marx.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.633
Bay area crime lord.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.070
Marx accused Creek of cheating,
threatened to kill him.

18:35.157 --> 18:36.941
Felony narcotics, assault

18:37.028 --> 18:38.726
assault with a deadly,
and attempted murder.

18:38.813 --> 18:41.250
A mobbed-up guy like this
could leave a pig's head

18:41.337 --> 18:43.078
outside somebody's door.
Go pick him up.

18:43.165 --> 18:46.168
He's in the wind. Parole officer
hasn't heard from him in weeks.

18:46.255 --> 18:47.604
Crap.

18:47.691 --> 18:50.172
We think we can find him
at this gambling club

18:50.259 --> 18:52.392
but SFPD Is busting
the place next week.

18:52.479 --> 18:54.742
- Asked us to go in quiet.
- How quiet?

18:57.440 --> 19:00.313
[techno music]

19:30.430 --> 19:32.258
Hey.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.216
There's Marx.

19:47.403 --> 19:48.796
You okay.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.058
You no.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.193
I wanna play craps.
This is the only table.

19:54.280 --> 19:57.892
Too bad.

19:57.979 --> 20:01.156
It's okay, baby.
I'll play for the both of us.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.941
I bet I do better than you would
have done anyways.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.335
Go get a drink.
This won't take long.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.599
[man] $63.

20:09.686 --> 20:11.035
Hi.

20:13.386 --> 20:16.084
[indistinct conversations]

20:31.665 --> 20:33.493
What is it?
What happened?

20:33.580 --> 20:36.322
Darcy's okay.
It's not her.

20:36.409 --> 20:39.020
Not directly anyway.

20:39.107 --> 20:41.979
Panzer..
The gift that keeps on giving.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.810
Do you remember Tom Maier?

20:46.897 --> 20:49.422
He was the father
of Panzer's first victim?

20:49.509 --> 20:52.251
Sure. Nice man.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.516
He killed himself today.

20:58.866 --> 21:00.259
Oh.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.138
Oh.

21:19.016 --> 21:20.191
[speaks indistinctly]

21:20.279 --> 21:22.019
[sighs]
Oh, well.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.849
[chips rattling]

21:25.936 --> 21:27.764
Try again.

21:27.851 --> 21:29.592
Thanks.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.638
Side bet?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.553
Like?

21:37.383 --> 21:38.949
[whispering indistinctly]

21:43.824 --> 21:45.565
You have a bet.

21:45.652 --> 21:46.957
[chuckles]

21:54.791 --> 21:56.358
'Eight the hard way.
Winner, Eight.'

21:56.445 --> 21:58.055
Ohh.

22:01.755 --> 22:03.583
[exhales deeply]

22:03.670 --> 22:06.760
'And the shooter passes. We got
a new shooter coming out?'

22:09.502 --> 22:11.417
Pay up.

22:11.504 --> 22:12.635
Right now?

22:12.722 --> 22:13.854
Why not?

22:13.941 --> 22:15.334
Here?

22:45.799 --> 22:48.454
So you're pretty much
tall, dark, and handsome.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.500
- Yeah.
- I like that.

22:51.587 --> 22:56.200
Police. Brock Marx.
You're under arrest.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.288
[handcuffs clicking]

22:57.376 --> 22:58.464
For what?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.291
Parole violation.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.207
We need to ask you a few
questions about a murder.

23:03.294 --> 23:05.645
[exhales deeply]

23:05.732 --> 23:06.950
Nice work.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.430
Thank you.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.739
What'd you whisper
to him?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.045
Wouldn't you like to know?

23:36.502 --> 23:39.418
[dramatic music]

23:51.168 --> 23:52.343
'Morning, Lisbon.'

23:52.431 --> 23:54.171
Uh, I need to borrow
your office.

23:54.258 --> 23:58.741
Too bad. I'm busy.
What costs $127.68?

23:58.828 --> 24:02.353
Creek spent that much every week
for months and was hiding it.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.095
Until three months ago. Hmm.
Anyway, your office?

24:05.182 --> 24:07.141
Are you gonna actually
help with this case?

24:07.228 --> 24:10.623
Well, as soon as I can get
Darcy off Panzer's case.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.233
Mr. Jane.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.540
Mrs. Maier, please,
thanks for coming to our office.

24:14.627 --> 24:17.934
Have a seat. Lisbon, this is
Teri Maier, Tom Maier's wife.

24:18.021 --> 24:22.765
Mrs. Maier, we are
so sorry for your loss.

24:22.852 --> 24:26.160
The gardener found him
in the backyard.

24:26.247 --> 24:28.423
Tom made sure it wasn't me
who found him.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.990
'Yeah.'

24:31.905 --> 24:34.429
The coroner's office
hasn't released the body yet.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.649
I need to bury him.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.782
Of course.
I'll check it out immediately.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.131
Thank you.

24:41.218 --> 24:44.874
Okay. I'm so sorry
for what happened.

24:44.961 --> 24:46.702
It was the guilt.

24:46.789 --> 24:48.661
It ate him up like a cancer.

24:50.184 --> 24:52.795
Every day Tom got smaller
and smaller

24:52.882 --> 24:54.405
until finally he left.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.582
Did he happen to
leave a note?

24:56.669 --> 24:58.497
No.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.499
But honestly, I haven't checked.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.676
He felt bad.

25:03.763 --> 25:07.027
So the only thing he could do
was hang himself.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.424
He was in so much pain,
and all I feel is angry.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.296
We will do everything
we can

25:15.383 --> 25:18.560
to get the coroner to release
the body as soon as possible.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.870
Okay. Thank you.

25:31.486 --> 25:34.445
Uh, I got a lot to do,
so have a nice day.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.752
- Jane?
- Yes.

25:36.839 --> 25:38.537
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

25:38.624 --> 25:41.496
Deniability, Lisbon.
Deniability. Your best friend.

25:56.859 --> 25:58.687
'Sent to Creek
before he was killed.'

26:00.559 --> 26:02.822
A warning of what's
to come, huh?

26:02.909 --> 26:05.955
Make him afraid, paranoid?

26:06.042 --> 26:07.653
This is just your style..

26:07.740 --> 26:09.480
...cheap, gruesome, sadistic.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.489
You got a question for me?

26:18.577 --> 26:20.579
Or you just wanna chat?

26:23.016 --> 26:24.539
You can keep that.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.979
Lisbon, it's Jane. Let's have
lunch in San Francisco.

26:30.066 --> 26:33.374
What do you say? Call me.

26:45.081 --> 26:48.171
Teresa, aw, can't tell you
how great it is to see you.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.566
Partnered with this one
for three years.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.612
Oh, I know. Patrick Jane.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.352
Bobby Wilson.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.006
So how's it goin'?

26:57.093 --> 26:59.182
How's the big old CBI?

26:59.269 --> 27:01.924
Oh, you know, it goes.

27:02.011 --> 27:04.666
FBI's all over us
about this, uh, Panzer case.

27:04.753 --> 27:08.235
Oh, feebs. They were jackbooting
about it over here, too.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.976
Anyway, what
do you say, Bobby?

27:10.063 --> 27:12.805
Could you show us your, uh,
file on the Panzer case?

27:12.892 --> 27:15.242
Uh, yeah, sure.

27:15.329 --> 27:19.289
Just have CBI file a request.
It's form 29.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.856
Oh, of course.
Yeah. Yeah.

27:20.943 --> 27:23.032
We were hoping that
maybe we could, uh..

27:23.119 --> 27:25.992
...expedite the process,
you know, talk to you.

27:26.079 --> 27:28.037
We're under the gun
with time.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.128
He's okay, Bobby.

27:38.874 --> 27:41.050
Did you find any..
You know, never mind.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.270
Deniability.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.968
Guess what we found out?

27:46.055 --> 27:48.449
California bar was investigating
your law partner

27:48.536 --> 27:50.190
over his gambling.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.847
That's what your fight was
about last week, wasn't it?

27:58.198 --> 28:00.679
Yes. Alton was
out of control.

28:00.766 --> 28:03.116
- So you lied to us.
- Don't answer that.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.858
If al got disbarred,
that was the end of your firm.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.424
He'd become a liability.

28:07.511 --> 28:10.601
And how do lawyers
deal with liability?

28:10.689 --> 28:13.039
Oh, don't worry.
It's not a lawyer joke.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.084
[Van Pelt]
'They get insurance.'

28:15.171 --> 28:17.652
You insured Alton Creek's life
for $10 million.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.262
'Four weeks ago.'

28:20.699 --> 28:22.831
Larry?

28:22.918 --> 28:25.051
I didn't have time
to mention it.

28:25.138 --> 28:27.575
It's common for businesses
to have a "key man" policy.

28:27.662 --> 28:29.185
Al was "key."

28:29.272 --> 28:31.187
Uh, you know what?
We're done here.

28:31.274 --> 28:34.582
Admit it. Alton was worth more
to you dead so you killed him.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.062
- I said we're done.
- Fine.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.454
Let's go, Mr. Dersh.

28:39.761 --> 28:44.853
Agent, seriously, I don't think
Larry is capable of this.

28:44.940 --> 28:48.770
Don't be naive.
Men lie...and kill.

28:55.124 --> 28:56.430
Maier?

28:56.517 --> 28:58.345
Yes. Thomas.

28:58.432 --> 28:59.999
Right in here.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.623
Five minutes.

29:15.710 --> 29:17.190
Thank you.

30:07.196 --> 30:09.590
Hey, we've had Brock Marx
in the box for hours.

30:09.677 --> 30:11.157
The guy won't talk.

30:11.244 --> 30:14.900
Ah. Theory number one..
Crime lord. Pig's head. Yes.

30:14.987 --> 30:16.727
We've got his law partner
as well.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.512
Insurance motive.
You want to question him?

30:18.599 --> 30:20.340
Kind of busy right now.

30:20.427 --> 30:22.385
Why don't you guys
get your suspects together?

30:22.472 --> 30:25.040
I'll meet you back here
in some time. I promise.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.347
- Where are you going?
- Got a find a hobo.

30:27.434 --> 30:30.567
Do some errands. Then I gotta
run by this flower shop, too.

30:30.654 --> 30:32.439
What? Find a hobo?

30:32.526 --> 30:34.267
Flower shop.

30:43.232 --> 30:45.539
[knock on door]

30:53.025 --> 30:55.897
[clacking]

30:58.378 --> 31:03.470
[cell phone rings]

31:03.557 --> 31:06.690
[ring]

31:06.777 --> 31:08.518
Patrick, it's Susan.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.956
Ah, Susan.
What do I owe the pleasure?

31:11.043 --> 31:12.522
'Well, I'm callingyouback.'

31:12.609 --> 31:14.220
Oh, that's right. Yeah.

31:14.307 --> 31:17.266
'I wanted to let you know
I went down to the SFPD.'

31:17.353 --> 31:18.615
'I didn't find anything.'

31:18.702 --> 31:20.182
'I know.
So, why'd you go?'

31:20.269 --> 31:22.402
Well, this Panzer-Red John
copycat thing

31:22.489 --> 31:24.404
has me very intrigued.

31:24.491 --> 31:28.277
'I wanna help out as much
as I possibly can.'

31:28.364 --> 31:31.585
So, uh..
Susan, you still there?

31:31.672 --> 31:34.457
Listen, I need to talk to you
about a couple things.

31:34.544 --> 31:36.155
- I've gotta go.
- Wait. Patrick?

31:36.242 --> 31:37.939
[door squeaks]

31:39.071 --> 31:40.028
[door closes]

31:40.115 --> 31:41.421
'Patrick, are you there?'

31:41.508 --> 31:43.162
[whispers]
'Bye.'

31:44.815 --> 31:46.382
[keys clatter]

31:56.653 --> 31:58.220
'Hello?'

32:03.617 --> 32:05.880
[door closes]

32:14.236 --> 32:15.455
[elevator bell dings]

32:15.542 --> 32:17.065
- Patrick.
- Susan.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.849
I was hoping we could
talk some--

32:18.937 --> 32:20.242
Jane, they're waiting
for you.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.549
Hang on one second.
I have a few questions--

32:22.636 --> 32:25.160
You're more than welcome to wait
in the interview room

32:25.247 --> 32:27.684
but this one hasn't done squat
on our murder investigation

32:27.771 --> 32:29.208
and he's damn well
gonna help.

32:29.295 --> 32:30.992
Yes, I damn well am gonna help.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.951
I'm sorry.
I won't be long.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.171
Thanks for rescuing me.

32:36.258 --> 32:38.608
Shh!

32:38.695 --> 32:40.393
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:40.480 --> 32:41.698
I didn't call you in.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.744
Oh. Mr. Jane asked me
to come in.

32:46.399 --> 32:48.836
Hi. Okay, folks.
Let's get straight to it.

32:48.923 --> 32:51.360
Patrick Jane.
Nice to meet you.

32:51.447 --> 32:53.797
Do you prefer eggs
for breakfast over cereal?

32:53.884 --> 32:55.538
Cereal.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.367
Hardened criminal like yourself.
That's very interesting.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.848
What's your favorite
legal objection?

33:00.935 --> 33:04.634
Better to be feared or loved?
You don't have to answer that.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.160
'Summer.'

33:08.247 --> 33:10.336
Patrick Jane.
Pleasure to finally meet you.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.380
Hi.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.947
You..

33:13.034 --> 33:15.515
'You are
a borderline sociopath.'

33:15.602 --> 33:17.169
Extremely violent.

33:17.256 --> 33:19.519
But not our killer.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.651
You were jealous
of the victim's talent

33:21.738 --> 33:23.131
his skills
in the courtroom

33:23.218 --> 33:25.003
but he never, uh,
bought you flowers.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.482
Flowers? No.

33:26.569 --> 33:28.832
Yeah. The flower shop
nearest your office

33:28.919 --> 33:31.052
uh, sells a dozen red roses

33:31.139 --> 33:35.839
for a very reasonable price
of $127.68.

33:35.926 --> 33:37.928
It was flowers?
Seriously?

33:38.016 --> 33:41.193
Yes. Our romantic victim
bought them once a week.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.760
A secret relationship
he couldn't disclose..

33:43.847 --> 33:45.501
An illicit one.

33:47.634 --> 33:49.288
Maybe not that illicit.

33:49.375 --> 33:52.465
No offense. But how many men
do buy roses for hookers?

33:52.552 --> 33:54.989
Oh. I don't hook anymore.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.905
But they do buy them
for girlfriends.

33:57.992 --> 34:01.822
Girlfriends they can't have
under certain rules.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.606
You killed Alton Creek.

34:03.693 --> 34:06.827
[scoffs]
Uh, that's ridiculous.

34:06.914 --> 34:08.959
I'm an officer of the court.

34:10.874 --> 34:13.225
I see homicidal rage,
betrayal.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.922
You were lovers.
Yes, that's right.

34:15.009 --> 34:17.968
And he dumped you.
Hence, the pig's head.

34:19.187 --> 34:20.928
Pig for a pig.

34:21.015 --> 34:23.452
Ms. Santori, we'll have
to ask you a few questions--

34:23.539 --> 34:25.846
You killed Al?
You bitch!

34:25.933 --> 34:27.108
[Patrick]
Oh. Hello.

34:28.805 --> 34:31.721
[grunting]

34:33.506 --> 34:34.811
Have a nice day.

34:34.898 --> 34:36.552
Ugh!

34:39.338 --> 34:42.341
Al was an okay guy.
Why the hell did you kill him?

34:42.428 --> 34:44.821
- I got this, Summer.
- "An okay guy"?

34:44.908 --> 34:47.476
He said he'd marry me,
the bastard!

34:47.563 --> 34:49.174
And then he changed his mind.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.524
He just wasn't ready,
wasn't sure of his feelings.

34:51.611 --> 34:54.353
Oh, a divorce attorney who was
holding out for true love..

34:54.440 --> 34:57.138
The affair ended months ago,
long time to hold a grudge.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.966
Can you take her
to holding, please?

34:59.053 --> 35:01.621
Hey, I waited for him
foryears.

35:01.708 --> 35:04.276
I put my career on hold
to be with him.

35:04.363 --> 35:07.148
I wanted a family,
and now it is too late.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.846
He took away my life!

35:09.933 --> 35:12.545
And turns out,
all he wanted was a hooker.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.503
I'm not a hooker, bitch.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.724
Susan, did you wanna
talk now?

35:17.811 --> 35:19.378
I don't have any time.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.902
Field office just got a tip
on the Panzer murder.

35:21.989 --> 35:24.948
Homeless guy found a bag
of stuff in an alley in Fresno.

35:25.035 --> 35:26.428
Tip from a hobo?

35:26.515 --> 35:28.082
My people are on it.

35:28.169 --> 35:31.216
A bag of clothes with blood
spatter on it and a knife.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.740
Looks like it could be
the knife that killed Panzer.

35:33.827 --> 35:37.657
Mm. Copycat's sloppy
if it's his knife.

35:37.744 --> 35:40.007
Red John would never
have been that careless.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.183
Forensics is running
the blood now.

35:42.270 --> 35:45.360
Oh, get this.

35:45.447 --> 35:49.059
The alley is in the neighborhood
near the Maier home.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.671
Thomas Maier? No.

35:51.758 --> 35:54.587
- Yeah. The San Joaquin killer.
- I know who he is.

35:54.674 --> 35:56.371
He's the father
of the first victim.

35:56.458 --> 35:57.981
I-I-I don't buy that.

35:58.068 --> 36:00.158
Maier killed himself
yesterday.

36:02.029 --> 36:04.205
We're going to the house now
to search it.

36:04.292 --> 36:06.033
Okay. Good luck.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.571
I have a confession to make.

36:24.704 --> 36:26.619
When Tom killed himself

36:26.706 --> 36:29.665
'part of me was angry at him
for being weak.'

36:32.712 --> 36:35.628
But now I know how strong
he was.

36:35.715 --> 36:37.717
Now I know.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.241
The FBI found this letter
in molly's room.

36:40.328 --> 36:42.896
It's from Tom.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.681
It's important that you all
hear this

36:45.768 --> 36:47.640
so you can understand.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.558
"my dearest Teri..

36:54.299 --> 36:56.083
"if you are reading this

36:56.170 --> 36:59.434
"you know what I have done.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.132
"I have avenged myself
against Jim Panzer.

37:03.873 --> 37:06.746
"Jim was the man who killed
our molly.

37:09.531 --> 37:12.621
"When I saw him on TV
that night, I knew.

37:12.708 --> 37:16.059
"I knew he'd killed her.

37:16.146 --> 37:21.064
"I can't explain how..
except to say

37:21.151 --> 37:24.198
that molly's heart cried out
to me, and I knew."

37:26.809 --> 37:29.725
[sobbing]

37:32.206 --> 37:33.599
Please.

37:41.389 --> 37:45.306
"Killing the man who murdered
our daughter

37:45.393 --> 37:47.439
"is the best thing
I will ever do.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
"I'm at peace.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.276
"I'm just sorry
that I'm leaving you alone

37:58.363 --> 38:01.191
"and I hope you forgive me

38:01.279 --> 38:04.238
"and that in some way,
this letter brings you..

38:05.979 --> 38:07.720
...some kind of comfort."

38:07.807 --> 38:10.113
[paper rustles]

38:13.073 --> 38:14.727
"Love, Tom."

38:23.126 --> 38:27.522
[man]
"Lord, make me
an instrument of your peace.

38:27.609 --> 38:32.222
"where there is hatred,
let me so love.

38:32.310 --> 38:36.096
And where there is darkness,
light. Amen."

38:47.325 --> 38:49.762
That's very nice of you
to give her that letter.

38:49.849 --> 38:51.851
Oh, well, it's the least
I could do.

38:51.938 --> 38:53.766
My god, poor woman.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.334
Yeah.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.858
So...the case is closed.

38:58.945 --> 39:01.774
Once we got the labs back,
it was a slam dunk.

39:01.861 --> 39:05.168
'The prints
on the knife, Maier's.'

39:11.914 --> 39:13.786
'The blood was Panzer's.
It was denatured'

39:13.873 --> 39:15.744
'but it was definitely his.'

39:25.841 --> 39:28.061
But why Red John? Why..

39:28.148 --> 39:30.106
Why would he copycat
a dead man?

39:30.193 --> 39:32.979
I don't know.

39:33.066 --> 39:36.286
Maybe he felt like he had to
emulate a monster to hunt one.

39:36.374 --> 39:40.116
So he picked the biggest one
he could find.

39:40.203 --> 39:41.901
One thing I can't
figure out, though

39:41.988 --> 39:44.730
is why he was stalking me,
and why the video?

39:46.819 --> 39:48.864
Hunting monsters
changes you.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.607
Went and killed himself
the very next day.

39:52.694 --> 39:56.437
I hope he found peace
in the end.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.483
Goodbye, agent Darcy.

40:05.272 --> 40:07.361
Did it change you, Patrick?

40:08.928 --> 40:10.320
Hunting a monster?

40:11.974 --> 40:13.411
Of course.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.545
Be well, Susan.

40:23.638 --> 40:25.901
Ithaschanged you,
you know.

40:28.077 --> 40:30.340
Darcy's off the case, Lisbon.
She's safe.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.300
And what about you?
How is Red John gonna feel

40:33.387 --> 40:36.259
when he finds out you spoiled
his fun with agent Darcy?
