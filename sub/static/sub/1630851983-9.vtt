00:18.769 --> 00:22.189
Why are you still bothering with
my exoplanet, Franklin?

00:22.272 --> 00:25.192
CARA said it was too far for us
to reach right now.

00:25.275 --> 00:27.444
But even if we can't get there in person,

00:27.528 --> 00:30.572
we can still use technology
to get more information about it.

00:30.656 --> 00:34.409
Which could help us learn a lot
about its potential for life.

00:34.493 --> 00:37.788
Still, can you imagine
what it'd be like to travel there?

00:37.871 --> 00:42.000
The wonders of the cosmos
stretching out before you.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.586
The space wind in your hair.

00:44.670 --> 00:46.713
There's no wind in space.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.216
I was speaking metaphorically, of course.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.552
There's no metaphors in space, either.

01:20.330 --> 01:24.209
If I could go on a road trip
to another solar system,

01:24.293 --> 01:28.505
I'd finally get to check off a few items
on my must-see nebula list.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.425
What's a nebula?

01:32.885 --> 01:34.553
To the monitors.

01:38.140 --> 01:42.769
A nebula is where new stars are born,
in a cloud of dust and gas.

01:43.896 --> 01:47.274
Can you imagine
anything more beautiful than dust and gas?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.861
I can think of a few things actually.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.199
There's the Horsehead Nebula.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.460
And the Eagle Nebula.

02:15.385 --> 02:18.138
And who could forget
the Ham Sandwich Nebula?

02:20.724 --> 02:21.725
Just kidding.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.896
Sure, space is beautiful,
but don't forget the dangers.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.814
Like black holes.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.735
That doesn't sound very fun.

02:31.818 --> 02:36.365
Unless your idea of fun involves an area
where gravity has become so strong

02:36.448 --> 02:38.158
that nothing around it can escape.

02:38.242 --> 02:42.829
Not even, like, tearing a hole
in the fabric of space and time.

02:42.913 --> 02:47.000
Frankly, the thought of holes
in the fabric of anything is terrifying.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.233
Oh, no.
This will take hours to reorganize.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.696
Cherry.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.324
That was a fresh cup.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.376
Oh, no.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.879
We lost track of the exoplanet.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.926
It's okay. Someone must have recorded
the coordinates, right?

03:41.471 --> 03:42.514
Right?

03:44.516 --> 03:45.767
Nope.

03:45.851 --> 03:47.811
If no one logged the coordinates,

03:47.895 --> 03:50.606
then how will we ever find
the exoplanet again?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.316
No problem.

03:52.399 --> 03:56.778
If my big brother found it once,
he'll be able to find it again, right?

04:04.328 --> 04:05.412
Sure thing.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.759
You can do this.

04:25.349 --> 04:26.350
It's…

04:27.476 --> 04:30.187
Come on. Where is it?

04:30.270 --> 04:34.399
Get it together, Charlie Brown.
We need results.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.028
I'll never find it.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.116
Wait. What's that?

04:43.867 --> 04:44.952
I found it!

04:46.453 --> 04:47.621
Yeah!

04:49.039 --> 04:53.252
It just looks a little different now.
A lot smaller.

04:53.335 --> 04:56.338
That's normal for exoplanets, right?

04:56.421 --> 04:58.298
No, Charlie Brown, it's not.

05:07.182 --> 05:10.310
Charles, it appears you found an asteroid.

05:10.394 --> 05:11.645
A what?

05:13.564 --> 05:16.066
Asteroids are
rocky bodies orbiting the sun.

05:17.860 --> 05:22.781
They vary in size, from tiny
to nearly the size of a small planet.

05:23.407 --> 05:25.826
Nice work. You found a rock.

05:25.909 --> 05:29.121
There's just something
about you and rocks, Charlie Brown.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.333
I guess my luck is pretty rock-specific.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.962
<i>So, any updates on your progress?</i>

05:37.045 --> 05:38.088
Well…

05:38.172 --> 05:41.341
- We had the coordinates, but--
- There were some issues.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.926
A lot of issues.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.887
We lost it.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.555
<i>I see.</i>

05:48.265 --> 05:50.142
What are we going to do now?

05:50.225 --> 05:53.604
That exoplanet could have been
the breakthrough we were looking for.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.940
<i>It is disappointing,
but setbacks happen in science,</i>

05:57.024 --> 06:01.111
<i>especially when exploring
something as unpredictable as space.</i>
<i>especially when exploring
something as unpredictable as space.</i>

06:01.195 --> 06:03.530
<i>Sometimes missions need to be postponed,</i>

06:03.614 --> 06:05.866
<i>or you didn't find
what you thought you would.</i>

06:05.949 --> 06:09.578
<i>That's why you can't count on
finding all your answers in one place.</i>

06:09.661 --> 06:10.913
That's why they tell you

06:10.996 --> 06:13.957
not to put all your space eggs
in one space rocket.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.001
I don't think it goes like that.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.211
Well, it should.

06:17.920 --> 06:22.424
<i>In this case, exoplanets hold
a lot of promise for the search for life.</i>

06:22.508 --> 06:26.470
<i>And as our technology develops,
we may be able to find out more.</i>

06:26.553 --> 06:29.556
<i>But as you've found,
they can be difficult to study.</i>

06:29.640 --> 06:33.393
<i>So it's not always possible
to answer all our questions.</i>

06:33.977 --> 06:36.230
Man, science is tough.

06:36.313 --> 06:37.314
- Yep.
- Sure is.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.233
- Yep.
- Agreed.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.946
<i>When it comes to science,
you have to be willing to keep looking,</i>

06:44.029 --> 06:46.156
<i>even if it's not where you expected.</i>

06:49.493 --> 06:53.372
Hold on. There's something different
about that asteroid.

06:53.997 --> 06:57.042
Its orbit is moving
in the opposite direction

06:57.125 --> 06:58.669
of everything else around it.

06:58.752 --> 07:02.840
That's okay. Sometimes you have to move
to the beat of your own drum.
That's okay. Sometimes you have to move
to the beat of your own drum.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.973
Actually, when it comes to orbits,

07:11.056 --> 07:13.058
everything that comes
from our solar system

07:13.141 --> 07:17.145
is supposed to go in the same direction,
including asteroids.

07:17.229 --> 07:21.024
That means
this may not be just any asteroid.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.527
<i>You're onto something, Franklin.</i>

07:23.610 --> 07:26.780
<i>It appears this asteroid
may in fact be an object</i>

07:26.864 --> 07:28.407
<i>which has traveled from…</i>

07:30.993 --> 07:33.370
<i>another solar system!</i>

07:37.291 --> 07:40.502
<i>What? Sometimes I like to do
my own sound effects.</i>

07:46.341 --> 07:48.302
<i>Wow, tough crowd.</i>
