00:00.007 --> 00:01.714
I just thought you might be... interested

00:01.714 --> 00:03.180
in this little side project thing.

00:03.182 --> 00:04.348
What's the job?

00:04.373 --> 00:05.849
It's the Goddamn golden goose, kid.

00:05.851 --> 00:07.584
State lets you grow it and sell it.

00:07.586 --> 00:09.720
Feds tell the banks they
can't hold the money.

00:09.722 --> 00:11.768
All cash transactions.

00:12.124 --> 00:13.790
- Somebody put that there.
- Heroin.

00:13.792 --> 00:17.394
You dried-up bitch! I'm gonna kill you!

00:17.396 --> 00:18.595
They have a witness.

00:18.597 --> 00:20.063
I need you to tell me

00:20.065 --> 00:22.665
if there is anyone the ADA
could have found to testify

00:22.667 --> 00:26.136
that you paid for or
arranged Javier Cano's murder.

00:26.138 --> 00:28.138
I need you to find some people.

00:28.140 --> 00:29.147
Who?

00:29.808 --> 00:31.341
What are you asking me to do?

00:31.343 --> 00:33.276
What I tell you to do.

00:33.278 --> 00:34.477
We could leave.

00:34.479 --> 00:35.522
I can't.

00:35.680 --> 00:37.080
You think <i>they</i> would care?

00:45.690 --> 00:47.889
Holy shit! What happened?

00:54.417 --> 00:55.432
J?

00:55.434 --> 00:57.354
J, can you come back?

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074

02:36.268 --> 02:39.736
Hasn't Little J been all over
your ass about pulling jobs?

02:40.000 --> 02:42.288
Kinda disrespectful then not to show up

02:42.536 --> 02:45.504
when you're supposedly in
charge of running things.

02:46.841 --> 02:48.471
Yeah. I'll talk to him about that.

02:50.277 --> 02:52.374
Power of attorney
to an 18-year-old?

02:52.844 --> 02:55.013
Smurf's got a sick sense of humor.

02:55.015 --> 02:57.380
Who told you that? Right on Ocean.

02:58.535 --> 03:00.130
J's not in charge of shit.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.661
You're assuming that Smurf's getting out.

03:02.889 --> 03:04.142
But what if she doesn't?

03:04.891 --> 03:06.558
J's holding all the cards.

03:06.560 --> 03:09.293
He could freeze you guys out,
walk away with everything.

03:10.431 --> 03:12.039
Nah, he wouldn't walk away.

03:12.499 --> 03:14.266
Listen. You're smart.

03:14.368 --> 03:18.081
But when Smurf looks at you, she sees me.

03:18.193 --> 03:20.135
Smurf doesn't think about you.

03:20.633 --> 03:22.544
Then why don't you have power of attorney?

03:25.035 --> 03:26.069
Hmm?

03:31.118 --> 03:32.985
Who knows, man? Maybe he just overslept.

03:32.987 --> 03:35.129
Crenshaw to Jefferson. Write it down.

03:35.389 --> 03:37.014
Or Nicky's bitching at him.

03:37.124 --> 03:38.456
I mean, who told him it was a good idea

03:38.458 --> 03:40.802
to move your side-piece
in with your girlfriend?

03:42.910 --> 03:43.949
Your phone, bro.

03:45.065 --> 03:46.198
- _
- Damn it.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.524
- Who was that?
- I don't know. It was blocked.

03:53.140 --> 03:54.473
You know, we're moving pretty fast

03:54.475 --> 03:56.074
for something this complicated.

03:56.455 --> 03:59.694
Deran's smart and all, but... he ain't Baz.

03:59.756 --> 04:02.947
We'll be fine as long as he
doesn't let Billy get into his head.

04:02.949 --> 04:06.217
He's a dope fiend. He's
not exactly Osama bin Laden.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.953
He weasels his way in. He's a prick.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.223
Smurf slept with him once,

04:11.225 --> 04:13.692
and it took her six years
to move him out of the house.

04:42.789 --> 04:43.922
Commander.

04:43.924 --> 04:45.026
Where's her stuff?

04:46.527 --> 04:47.592
Where's her shit?!

04:47.594 --> 04:49.176
It's down there on the right.

04:49.530 --> 04:51.196
Where? Here?

04:51.198 --> 04:52.262
Yeah.

04:52.666 --> 04:53.798
I-Is she okay?

04:53.800 --> 04:55.980
No, she is not okay.

04:57.204 --> 04:58.864
She lost a lot of blood.

04:59.740 --> 05:01.418
Nicked the femoral artery.

05:02.008 --> 05:04.481
She's fighting for her
life in the ICU right now.

05:04.945 --> 05:08.444
They found heroin and
fentanyl in her system!

05:09.416 --> 05:10.482
Are you shooting her up?

05:10.484 --> 05:11.550
No. No, no.

05:12.887 --> 05:14.286
Well, where'd she get the gun?

05:14.288 --> 05:15.460
I don't know.

05:15.622 --> 05:16.821
That is bullshit.

05:16.823 --> 05:18.223
I don't know how it happened!

05:18.225 --> 05:20.026
Is it here, or did you
get rid of it already?!

05:21.707 --> 05:23.352
You know, she's lying for you.

05:23.497 --> 05:24.696
She's lying to the police.

05:24.698 --> 05:25.982
She's lying to me.

05:27.033 --> 05:28.713
Even now, she's trying to protect you.

05:29.103 --> 05:31.904
The nurses found her outside bleeding out.

05:33.373 --> 05:35.767
You're just a piece-of-shit
kid from the projects

05:36.206 --> 05:37.910
living with his junkie mother!

05:37.912 --> 05:41.179
She felt sorry for you. We all did.

05:41.633 --> 05:42.923
But I should have known better.

05:43.450 --> 05:45.183
As far as you're concerned,
she's dead to you.

05:45.185 --> 05:46.718
Do you understand me?

05:46.720 --> 05:48.607
You're the worst thing
that's ever happened to her!

05:48.725 --> 05:50.630
You will <i>never</i> see her again!

05:51.125 --> 05:52.474
Is everything okay?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.262
Who the hell are you?

05:57.264 --> 05:58.330
Mia.

05:58.332 --> 05:59.397
Mia.

05:59.399 --> 06:00.437
Yeah.

06:00.801 --> 06:02.093
That's perfect.

06:03.737 --> 06:05.467
You piece of shit.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.810
Nicky got shot?

06:12.279 --> 06:13.830
What do you want?

06:14.087 --> 06:15.347
Just hadn't seen you in a couple days.

06:15.349 --> 06:16.523
What do you want?

06:17.952 --> 06:20.775
J-Just leave, okay? Get out.

06:23.449 --> 06:24.607
Get out!

06:54.454 --> 06:55.628
Any stops?

06:55.973 --> 06:56.978
Nope.

06:57.524 --> 06:58.905
Weak points in the route?

06:59.526 --> 07:01.230
Nowhere gunfire wouldn't draw attention.

07:02.396 --> 07:03.691
What about the grow house?

07:03.691 --> 07:04.826
They got a safe.

07:05.399 --> 07:07.065
Security's tight, but we could get in.

07:07.067 --> 07:08.600
One safe, one grow house?

07:08.602 --> 07:11.122
That's a quarter of the money
we'd get if we hit the trucks.

07:12.427 --> 07:14.013
Can we hit it during the last pickup?

07:14.341 --> 07:17.464
Security cameras covering
the parking lot, every angle.

07:17.622 --> 07:19.944
There's also armed security guards
with the money from door to door.

07:19.946 --> 07:22.135
No. We have to do it here.

07:22.883 --> 07:24.683
We could run it a couple more times.

07:24.685 --> 07:27.019
If they rotate the drivers,
then maybe the routes change?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.979
We'd hit 'em somewhere isolated, you know?

07:30.504 --> 07:31.868
No. It's solid.

07:32.992 --> 07:34.802
J's not even here, man.

07:36.363 --> 07:37.486
We can do this.

07:38.428 --> 07:40.365
There's gonna be 60OK on that plane.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.056
You sure you want to walk away from that?

07:45.305 --> 07:46.271
Pope?

07:47.960 --> 07:49.052
I'm in.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.509
So, I'm gonna need you to talk to Jeff,

07:59.511 --> 08:01.378
get a truck, and get some
legit paperwork, okay?

08:01.403 --> 08:03.544
I don't want to get stopped on the tarmac.

08:03.569 --> 08:04.628
No problem.

08:04.631 --> 08:06.030
And we're gonna need
something with some, uh,

08:06.032 --> 08:07.699
4-wheel drive by tonight.

08:07.701 --> 08:09.567
- Nothing flashy.
- I can do that.

08:09.735 --> 08:10.701
Okay.

08:11.105 --> 08:12.819
Me and J will handle getting the vests.

08:12.844 --> 08:15.573
We don't need J. I'm your fourth.

08:16.217 --> 08:17.989
No, you're not. You're
too big to go in the box.

08:17.989 --> 08:19.987
Hey, kid can't show up for the meeting,

08:19.987 --> 08:21.454
he shouldn't be involved in the job.

08:21.456 --> 08:23.256
You don't get a say in this. J's in.

08:23.374 --> 08:24.382
You hear me?

08:25.592 --> 08:26.673
Christ.

08:29.449 --> 08:31.030
Can I talk to you for a second?

08:32.933 --> 08:34.095
Can you give us a minute?

08:36.871 --> 08:38.471
Yeah. I gotta go pick up Frankie, anyways.

08:38.472 --> 08:39.538
Can I take the Scout?

08:39.539 --> 08:40.755
No. Are you kidding me?

08:43.138 --> 08:44.681
Can I have some cabbage, please?

08:46.639 --> 08:48.182
I'll meet you back at the house.

08:59.566 --> 09:01.232
He could barely walk through the door.

09:01.257 --> 09:02.991
We can't cut him out of
the job. It's his job.

09:02.993 --> 09:05.727
This idiot wants to run a-an armored
truck off the road with a pistol.

09:05.729 --> 09:07.529
- Are you saying something?
- Yeah. I'm saying it.

09:07.531 --> 09:09.002
Why are we taking a junkie on the job?

09:09.002 --> 09:10.949
What do you want me to do,
leave him alone at the house?

09:13.538 --> 09:15.343
Okay, look, I'll give
him something small to do.

09:15.512 --> 09:16.539
Keep him busy.

09:16.886 --> 09:18.347
We can keep an eye on him. Okay?

09:19.143 --> 09:20.457
Can we get back to work?

09:20.828 --> 09:21.878
Yeah.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.813
- God.
- Okay.

09:24.986 --> 09:28.041
We have two armored guards on the tarmac...

09:28.066 --> 09:29.520
- God damn it.
- ...one in the plane.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.477
I got to take this. I'll... I'll be back.

09:35.870 --> 09:37.992
<i>- What?</i>
- I've been calling you.

09:38.430 --> 09:40.098
<i>Yeah, I was gonna call you back.</i>

09:41.033 --> 09:42.164
I need you to come down here.

09:42.166 --> 09:43.966
- Today.
- <i>To Mexico?</i>

09:43.968 --> 09:45.235
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can't do that.</i>

09:45.237 --> 09:46.903
I am in the middle of something.

09:46.905 --> 09:48.638
Maybe in a couple of days.

09:49.168 --> 09:50.504
<i>Pope, today.</i>

09:51.610 --> 09:52.683
<i>It's about Baz.</i>

09:53.578 --> 09:54.966
I'll see what I can do.

09:58.116 --> 09:59.186
Hey.

09:59.784 --> 10:01.041
I need you to get the car for me.

10:01.190 --> 10:02.853
- I'm getting the truck.
- Get them both.

10:02.854 --> 10:06.095
That was my parole officer.
I got to go take a piss test.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.233
What, now?

10:07.235 --> 10:08.913
Well, I go when they call.

10:09.106 --> 10:10.436
Yo, Deran's gonna be pissed.

10:10.438 --> 10:11.580
So don't tell him.

10:13.441 --> 10:15.175
Can you, uh... Can you take Billy with you?

10:15.177 --> 10:16.642
Aw, come on, man. I'm not doing...

10:16.644 --> 10:18.444
Just let Deran handle the logistics.

10:18.446 --> 10:20.615
I don't want Billy anywhere
near him when I'm not around.

10:21.257 --> 10:22.313
Do it.

10:27.340 --> 10:30.456
You know, this is the most complicated job

10:30.458 --> 10:31.989
we've planned without Baz.

10:32.514 --> 10:35.143
If we get caught, it's serious time, man.

10:35.663 --> 10:37.529
Yeah, well, we're not gonna get caught.

10:37.531 --> 10:38.976
Well, you're in charge,

10:39.001 --> 10:40.152
and, uh...

10:41.040 --> 10:43.603
that means it's on you if it goes south.

10:43.605 --> 10:45.363
Is this a pep talk or something?

10:45.363 --> 10:48.816
I mean, if you're... you're running
bullshit on the side or whatever,

10:49.470 --> 10:50.637
I want to know.

10:51.679 --> 10:52.678
I'm not.

10:52.680 --> 10:53.813
- No?
- No.

10:53.815 --> 10:56.372
What the hell is that
dipshit Colby doing outside?

10:57.619 --> 10:58.801
I don't know.

10:59.007 --> 11:00.205
Jesus.

11:00.789 --> 11:02.566
Hey, I get to do what I want
to do on my own time, okay?

11:02.590 --> 11:03.654
Yeah, you do.

11:03.654 --> 11:06.209
You wanna steal cars with these
assholes? That's fine. I'll walk.

11:06.361 --> 11:08.640
You and Baz used to pull shit
all the time without asking me.

11:08.665 --> 11:10.207
That was Baz, and I can't help you

11:10.232 --> 11:12.066
if you don't understand the difference.

11:12.068 --> 11:14.602
I need you in on <i>this</i> job 100%.

11:14.604 --> 11:15.543
Yeah. I am.

11:15.543 --> 11:17.508
Then get rid of Colby, or I'm out!

11:27.205 --> 11:28.231
Hey.

11:28.823 --> 11:31.164
Craig and Pope have been in
and out of here all morning.

11:32.293 --> 11:33.959
What, are you casing my bar now?

11:36.698 --> 11:38.185
You guys up to something?

11:39.166 --> 11:40.989
Yeah. They're helping
me renovate the bathroom.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.616
Come inside. Have a
drink. It's on the house.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.030
You said you had something for us.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.708
- Mm.
- What is it?

11:50.587 --> 11:53.913
I scouted it. It's weak.
It's too much of a risk.

11:53.915 --> 11:55.648
I shouldn't have floated you
something that wasn't ready.

11:55.650 --> 11:57.401
Okay. Well, take me to scout it.

11:57.652 --> 11:59.585
Maybe I can give you a
different perspective.

11:59.878 --> 12:01.387
No. I got something else for us.

12:01.389 --> 12:02.432
Like what?

12:02.857 --> 12:04.746
Just other opportunities.

12:05.060 --> 12:06.459
Well, you want people to work for you,

12:06.461 --> 12:07.840
you gotta give 'em work.

12:09.064 --> 12:11.291
Unless you're back to
being the Cody family bitch.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.634
There's a fence over on Casitas.

12:24.195 --> 12:25.639
He moves catalytic converters.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.680
Yeah, meth heads bring him metal?

12:27.682 --> 12:29.414
Doesn't sound like much of a haul.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.617
A single converter can go
for like 600 bucks, man.

12:31.619 --> 12:32.843
He moves hundreds of them.

12:33.528 --> 12:34.711
It's all cash.

12:34.956 --> 12:36.956
It's all stolen parts. He's
not gonna report any of it.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.824
He's got a Doberman in the junkyard.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.293
All we got to do is throw
a steak over the fence

12:40.295 --> 12:41.358
and we're in.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.492
How'd you hear about this?

12:44.432 --> 12:46.188
Baz used him when we were moving cars.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.407
And now you want to rip him off?

12:49.570 --> 12:50.770
He was Baz's guy. He's not mine.

12:50.772 --> 12:52.343
I don't give a shit. He's a dick.

12:53.908 --> 12:55.174
And we'll case the place together.

12:55.176 --> 12:56.709
If it's not right, it's not right.

12:56.711 --> 12:57.977
We'll find something else.

12:57.979 --> 12:59.875
We don't have to rush any of this, okay?

13:00.744 --> 13:02.181
Now come inside. Have a drink.

13:02.183 --> 13:03.385
Nah, man.

13:04.362 --> 13:05.881
I got shit to do.

13:07.550 --> 13:08.981
I'll be seeing you, all right?

13:09.415 --> 13:10.334
Yep.

13:18.065 --> 13:21.066
Smurf needs to hear from you.
She's been in there a long time.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.535
She's losing her resolve.

13:22.537 --> 13:23.803
Smurf's been in jail before.

13:23.805 --> 13:25.138
Yeah, when she was younger,

13:25.140 --> 13:27.406
but jail's no place for a grandmother.

13:27.408 --> 13:29.037
I'm paying for her protection.

13:29.811 --> 13:32.582
I'm taking care of the
buildings, all like she asked.

13:32.972 --> 13:34.605
Have you ever been in jail, J?

13:36.161 --> 13:37.184
No.

13:37.762 --> 13:39.129
I don't think you'd like it.

13:39.892 --> 13:40.920
Hey.

13:42.423 --> 13:43.751
Where were you this morning?

13:45.194 --> 13:46.611
Deran called you like six times.

13:46.611 --> 13:48.447
Oh, shit. Yeah. I forgot.

13:48.447 --> 13:49.481
He's pissed.

13:53.853 --> 13:57.202
The DA is sniffing
around, offering her deals.

13:57.202 --> 13:59.702
It's not good for her
to feel alone in there.

14:01.338 --> 14:03.007
Do you understand, J?

14:03.340 --> 14:04.727
This affects you.

14:05.798 --> 14:07.037
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:07.747 --> 14:08.992
How does it affect <i>you?</i>

14:11.940 --> 14:13.549
We're going to trial.

14:13.793 --> 14:15.750
Which means she's looking at years.

14:15.753 --> 14:17.489
She wants to see Lena again.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.722
Sit by a pool, enjoy a cocktail.

14:20.692 --> 14:21.895
Look around.

14:22.452 --> 14:24.252
She starts making deals,

14:24.429 --> 14:26.463
who do you think is the most expendable?

14:29.649 --> 14:30.803
Maybe it's you.

14:38.576 --> 14:42.111
Make sure your lawyer brings
you a dress or something.

14:42.113 --> 14:43.712
You show up looking ratchet,

14:43.714 --> 14:45.359
Judge is gonna think you're guilty.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.074
I'll keep that in mind.

14:51.723 --> 14:53.073
What's that?

14:53.911 --> 14:55.253
What does it look like?

14:56.702 --> 14:57.844
I don't want it.

14:58.195 --> 15:00.759
That bitch you framed
got sent back to gen-pop.

15:00.784 --> 15:02.737
She's talking mad shit
about messing you up.

15:11.342 --> 15:13.276
I have a court date tomorrow.

15:13.540 --> 15:15.406
I get caught with that, I'm screwed.

15:15.431 --> 15:17.639
You get caught alone with
Mercedes, you're dead.

15:17.748 --> 15:19.014
Tina told you to stay away from her.

15:19.016 --> 15:20.153
You didn't listen.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.748
Well, that's why I pay you to protect me.

15:23.538 --> 15:24.604
Yeah. About that...

15:24.629 --> 15:26.767
I don't renegotiate, baby.

15:27.156 --> 15:28.813
I made my deal with Pete.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.027
Pete pays us to sit with you at lunch.

15:32.029 --> 15:34.229
You want us to get between you
and some bitch with a blade,

15:34.381 --> 15:35.493
it's gonna be more.

15:38.369 --> 15:39.862
Keep her away from me.

15:53.318 --> 15:54.335
Hey.

15:56.084 --> 15:58.291
Let me guess. You're looking for J.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.422
I think he just went to
beg Deran for forgiveness.

16:02.965 --> 16:04.017
You want some?

16:06.362 --> 16:07.616
I need your help.

16:09.337 --> 16:10.434
With what?

16:12.603 --> 16:14.489
Oh. Don't worry about her, man.

16:14.541 --> 16:17.796
She's half-psychic, so
keeping secrets is futile.

16:19.132 --> 16:22.185
An errand. For the job.

16:23.222 --> 16:24.230
I get it.

16:24.749 --> 16:25.985
Pope sent you

16:27.877 --> 16:29.456
to keep an eye on me, right?

16:31.022 --> 16:33.077
Well, I don't know what you
did to him, but he's, uh...

16:34.047 --> 16:35.783
He's not your biggest fan, so...

16:36.693 --> 16:38.111
Let me ask you something.

16:38.592 --> 16:40.258
Do you remember me from
when you were little?

16:40.259 --> 16:41.453
No. Not really.

16:42.733 --> 16:43.771
He does.

16:44.789 --> 16:46.295
Look, you gonna help me or what?

16:47.389 --> 16:48.609
I don't know, kid.

16:48.853 --> 16:49.901
What do you think?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.583
Should we help the man?

16:56.341 --> 16:57.343
Sure.

17:08.487 --> 17:09.814
We had a meeting.

17:10.423 --> 17:11.912
Yeah, man. I'm sorry.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.574
Nicky's dad showed up, freaked out.

17:15.443 --> 17:16.855
He's taking her back to Guam.

17:17.579 --> 17:18.811
You guys break up?

17:20.828 --> 17:21.996
Yeah. I think so.

17:23.815 --> 17:24.938
You okay?

17:25.736 --> 17:26.737
Yeah.

17:27.582 --> 17:30.256
Good, 'cause I can't have
you distracted right now.

17:32.861 --> 17:34.002
Yeah. I'm fine.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.462
You've been all over
everybody about pulling a job,

17:36.464 --> 17:37.854
and now we have one.

17:38.790 --> 17:39.866
I said I got it.

17:44.338 --> 17:45.592
Okay, good.

17:46.875 --> 17:50.316
We got to do this the hard
way, so there's math and shit.

17:50.849 --> 17:51.878
You coming?

18:14.602 --> 18:15.794
How are you?

18:16.758 --> 18:17.942
Oh, I'm fine.

18:21.820 --> 18:23.106
Why am I here?

18:24.673 --> 18:26.468
There is an inmate we need to talk to,

18:27.238 --> 18:29.326
a guy from L.A., Hawaiian Gardens.

18:29.758 --> 18:32.377
He got busted on a drug charge
a couple weeks ago down here.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.489
He heard about a murder in Oceanside.

18:39.235 --> 18:40.294
Hey.

18:44.404 --> 18:45.698
Why is he here?

18:46.151 --> 18:47.736
Marco gets us in to see the guy.

18:49.315 --> 18:50.762
Sorry to hear about your brother.

18:54.093 --> 18:55.189
Let's go.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.218
Leave your car here.

19:00.966 --> 19:02.022
Come on.

19:15.714 --> 19:17.300
You got a new cellmate.

19:22.840 --> 19:24.345
Hey, Smurf.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.566
There you go.

19:40.739 --> 19:42.474
Range Rover. Big threads.

19:43.208 --> 19:45.240
Nah. That thing's way on the grid.

19:47.831 --> 19:49.750
- All right.
- There she is.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.658
What, we're starting a softball league?

19:51.683 --> 19:52.751
It's perfect.

19:52.944 --> 19:54.066
It's old as shit.

19:54.066 --> 19:56.491
We want old, before they installed GPS.

19:56.491 --> 19:58.445
Lose the plates, no
one's gonna come looking.

19:59.084 --> 20:00.564
She's not just a pretty face.

20:01.629 --> 20:03.903
What do you wanna bet the
kook left the keys on the tire?

20:05.299 --> 20:07.502
He took the fob, left
the wallet in the car.

20:07.768 --> 20:08.901
50 bucks?

20:08.903 --> 20:09.965
You got it.

20:10.705 --> 20:12.957
Watch. I win this every time.

20:19.514 --> 20:20.558
No fob.

20:49.210 --> 20:51.073
How much oxygen do you
think we're gonna need?

20:51.746 --> 20:53.812
Catalina aluminum 80 is 30 pounds.

20:53.814 --> 20:55.020
I think that's too heavy.

20:55.483 --> 20:58.208
Um... minis.

20:58.821 --> 20:59.952
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

20:59.954 --> 21:01.019
We only need them to last for an hour,

21:01.021 --> 21:02.488
maybe two if we get delayed.

21:02.490 --> 21:04.694
I think we have a couple lying
around at the garage at Smurf's.

21:07.442 --> 21:08.890
You're good with the jump, right?

21:09.830 --> 21:10.753
Yeah.

21:11.699 --> 21:12.889
Okay. Good.

21:15.303 --> 21:18.856
How often have you been,
uh, going to visit Smurf?

21:20.841 --> 21:22.115
Yeah, I go sometimes.

21:23.844 --> 21:25.244
I pay a little money each week

21:25.246 --> 21:26.830
to make sure she's protected in there.

21:28.097 --> 21:29.573
She talk shit about me?

21:31.545 --> 21:33.281
She just asks me to do things for her.

21:33.852 --> 21:34.883
Like what?

21:35.175 --> 21:37.848
I put money in her
commissary, stuff like that.

21:41.596 --> 21:43.968
How's she doing? How's
she... How's she seem?

21:45.266 --> 21:46.306
I don't know.

21:46.867 --> 21:48.000
Can't really tell.

21:48.002 --> 21:49.233
Yeah. That's Smurf.

21:54.426 --> 21:56.360
Do you think she'd ever talk to the cops?

21:56.692 --> 21:59.678
Apparently they've been on
her about us, offering deals.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.978
Nah. You kidding?

22:02.947 --> 22:05.529
The only person she would have
rolled on is Baz, and he's gone.

22:22.703 --> 22:25.438
All right, got an hour before
this asshole figures out

22:25.440 --> 22:28.148
his credit cards are
missing, so who wants tacos?

22:28.909 --> 22:29.957
Sounds good.

22:32.580 --> 22:34.231
So, where'd you learn how to do that?

22:35.949 --> 22:37.880
When I was a kid, we lived in a van.

22:38.188 --> 22:39.216
Yeah?

22:40.120 --> 22:42.055
My dad lost his keys a lot.

22:44.392 --> 22:45.814
Must have been a lot.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.347
_

23:17.826 --> 23:19.870
<i>Este es el tipo del
que te estaba hablando.</i>

23:20.664 --> 23:21.852
Sit down.

23:23.167 --> 23:24.630
Tell him what you told me.

23:26.967 --> 23:28.235
Before I got picked up,

23:28.569 --> 23:29.973
people were talking about a lady,

23:30.803 --> 23:32.472
paid someone to pull a hit on her son.

23:34.837 --> 23:35.824
Where?

23:36.244 --> 23:38.544
Oceanside. Shot him in his driveway.

23:41.141 --> 23:42.214
Gang-related?

23:43.117 --> 23:45.430
I don't think so. A rich white lady.

23:48.589 --> 23:49.792
Who was talking?

23:50.725 --> 23:52.009
The guys from 8th Street.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.389
Guess one of theirs was
the one who got paid.

23:59.734 --> 24:01.689
Did he say why she wanted him dead?

24:03.250 --> 24:04.603
I heard he stole from her.

24:25.025 --> 24:27.693
Heard you had a rough afternoon.

24:27.695 --> 24:29.747
You moved my cellmate, didn't you?

24:30.765 --> 24:34.500
You replaced her with that
little psychopath... Alvarez.

24:34.502 --> 24:37.513
I haven't worked
Corrections since I was 25.

24:37.513 --> 24:39.505
What, were you hoping she'd kill me?

24:39.507 --> 24:41.110
Oh, no.

24:41.110 --> 24:43.535
You were hoping I'd kill her,

24:43.712 --> 24:46.340
and then you could get me
on a real murder charge.

24:46.526 --> 24:48.781
I'm just glad they were
able to separate you two

24:48.783 --> 24:51.391
before something more...
permanent happened.

24:52.721 --> 24:54.320
I can get somebody down here if you'd like,

24:54.322 --> 24:55.817
and you can make a report.

24:56.230 --> 24:58.627
There's a lot of overcrowding in here.

24:59.477 --> 25:02.204
The COs are thinking that
maybe you two can work it out.

25:03.487 --> 25:05.749
You move me

25:05.873 --> 25:08.054
out of here today.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.922
And I'm not giving you 10 years.

25:13.707 --> 25:17.129
I will give you three, max,

25:17.415 --> 25:18.730
minimum security...

25:19.747 --> 25:21.502
Donovan, preferably,

25:22.416 --> 25:24.330
so I can see my granddaughter.

25:27.021 --> 25:28.544
And what do I get?

25:33.264 --> 25:35.176
You get my boys.

25:41.608 --> 25:42.860
You know he's talking about Smurf.

25:42.860 --> 25:46.701
Why's he even talking to
me? Just a good Samaritan?

25:47.489 --> 25:49.623
Anonymous tip out of the
goodness of his heart?

25:49.625 --> 25:52.026
You said put feelers out, so I did.

25:52.452 --> 25:53.651
I thought you'd want to know.

25:53.676 --> 25:55.542
Maybe you paid him to say some bullshit

25:55.567 --> 25:57.599
so I'd stop thinking it was you.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.759
Why would I kill Baz?

26:01.761 --> 26:02.901
Why would Smurf?

26:03.362 --> 26:04.588
That's her son.

26:05.703 --> 26:06.822
No, he wasn't.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.192
And she made sure he'd never forget it.

26:10.549 --> 26:12.970
All Smurf cares about is her own money,

26:12.972 --> 26:14.505
and <i>he</i> took that from her.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.640
Who does Smurf calls when she
wants something taken care of?

26:17.376 --> 26:19.624
She calls me. I didn't kill my brother.

26:22.319 --> 26:23.433
Neither did I.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.740
You're not the only one who misses Baz.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.018
And you're not the only one
who wants someone to pay for it.

26:33.242 --> 26:35.025
I could get someone inside San Marcos.

26:35.177 --> 26:37.496
You don't touch Smurf. You hear me?

26:39.358 --> 26:40.650
She's your mother.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.038
I get it.

26:43.248 --> 26:45.187
But she killed Baz.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.348
And you know it.

26:59.980 --> 27:02.639
Supposed to be a nice south
swell coming in this weekend.

27:03.196 --> 27:04.671
We should hit Trestles or something.

27:06.749 --> 27:08.832
I'm done embarrassing myself on a board.

27:09.616 --> 27:10.804
You got a bike?

27:11.554 --> 27:13.151
Why? You want to show off?

27:13.424 --> 27:14.451
Absolutely.

27:17.038 --> 27:18.105
Okay.

27:21.090 --> 27:23.490
I was telling my friend,
Luke, about you, and, uh...

27:23.492 --> 27:25.292
Oh, you're telling your friends about me?

27:25.668 --> 27:26.695
I'm honored.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.770
Um...

27:29.537 --> 27:32.699
He said something, and I figured
I'd just ask you about it.

27:32.701 --> 27:34.635
I don't want to make it
weird or anything, but...

27:34.637 --> 27:36.336
Well, you're kind of making it weird.

27:39.087 --> 27:40.541
He said your mom's in prison?

27:48.384 --> 27:50.823
Uh, she's in jail, actually.

27:52.373 --> 27:53.959
She hasn't made it to trial yet.

27:53.959 --> 27:54.985
For murder?

27:59.737 --> 28:01.046
I'm sorry, man.

28:02.968 --> 28:04.301
You don't talk about your mom,

28:04.303 --> 28:06.114
and I kind of figured she was dead.

28:09.841 --> 28:12.985
Hey, I felt weird knowing
that and not asking you.

28:19.118 --> 28:20.154
Deran?

28:20.740 --> 28:21.846
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:22.557 --> 28:24.187
Still can't get used to that hair.

28:26.458 --> 28:28.029
- Hey, man. I'm Adrian.
- Oh, hey.

28:28.029 --> 28:29.535
- Yeah, this is...
- Clark Lincoln.

28:30.460 --> 28:31.808
Oh, yeah. I know who you are.

28:32.490 --> 28:36.425
Adrian is a, uh... is
a surfer that I sponsor.

28:38.594 --> 28:40.240
I didn't mean to interrupt. Um...

28:40.486 --> 28:42.019
I'm in town for a few
days before South Africa,

28:42.021 --> 28:43.620
so maybe I'll see you around.

28:43.622 --> 28:44.754
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:44.756 --> 28:45.689
Nice to meet you.

28:47.861 --> 28:49.119
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

29:02.661 --> 29:04.108
What's all this stuff for?

29:10.966 --> 29:12.849
I talked to my girl at the hospital.

29:13.789 --> 29:15.218
Nicky's out of surgery.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.425
Looks like she'll still be able to walk.

29:20.294 --> 29:22.272
Pete says payment's double this week.

29:22.743 --> 29:24.928
Looks like Smurf's made
some enemies in there.

29:26.170 --> 29:27.391
Mm. She does that.

29:32.442 --> 29:33.645
So, you got the money or what?

29:35.727 --> 29:38.075
I think Smurf should maybe
start cleaning up her own mess.

29:38.380 --> 29:39.461
What do you think?

29:41.317 --> 29:42.950
Are you thinking about making a move?

29:43.282 --> 29:46.216
I'm just tired, tired
of being her errand boy.

29:46.450 --> 29:47.875
Well, she's the boss, isn't she?

29:48.563 --> 29:49.596
Yeah, well...

29:51.833 --> 29:53.400
Her lawyers think she might not get out.

29:54.273 --> 29:55.308
What do you think?

29:56.027 --> 29:58.223
I think you should tell Pete
that I don't have the money.

30:02.004 --> 30:02.974
Take a day.

30:05.876 --> 30:06.900
I'll cover for you.

30:08.016 --> 30:10.574
If you're gonna do something you
can't take back, just be sure.

30:12.787 --> 30:13.898
What do you care?

30:14.951 --> 30:16.048
Kinda like you.

30:17.954 --> 30:20.871
Don't want Pete to take a bat
to that pretty little face.

30:27.830 --> 30:29.007
You all right, man?

30:29.566 --> 30:31.484
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- You look a little antsy.

30:32.835 --> 30:33.824
What?

30:34.437 --> 30:36.573
Why don't you go switch out those plates?

30:38.241 --> 30:39.461
That's not a bad idea.

30:41.405 --> 30:42.322
Thanks.

30:42.845 --> 30:43.989
See you in a bit.

30:46.583 --> 30:48.461
You know, he shouldn't buy from down here.

30:50.279 --> 30:52.026
Lace all their shit with fentanyl.

30:52.723 --> 30:54.721
Billy can handle fentanyl.

30:55.032 --> 30:56.044
Yeah?

30:56.268 --> 30:57.596
You into that shit, too?

30:57.660 --> 30:58.993
Why? Would it bother you?

30:58.995 --> 31:00.757
You seem like you like to party.

31:00.757 --> 31:02.062
I don't do needles.

31:02.591 --> 31:04.506
Tequila, Molly, coke.

31:06.002 --> 31:07.126
That's more my speed.

31:07.470 --> 31:08.845
You don't like fuzzy.

31:09.005 --> 31:10.141
You like bright.

31:10.773 --> 31:12.013
That makes sense.

31:16.679 --> 31:18.332
So, you used to live in a van, huh?

31:23.886 --> 31:25.203
Family of gypsies?

31:25.749 --> 31:27.688
My dad was career military.

31:27.690 --> 31:30.158
He had a wife, three kids,
chocolate lab, picket fence,

31:30.160 --> 31:31.872
but he couldn't get comfortable.

31:32.358 --> 31:34.763
So he hooked up with my mom at a bar,

31:34.765 --> 31:36.764
had me, and they ran off together.

31:36.766 --> 31:38.655
Your sisters must have hated you.

31:39.843 --> 31:41.529
I've never met them.

31:43.241 --> 31:47.215
And what other people think
of me is none of my business.

31:50.913 --> 31:52.528
What's Billy want with my brother?

31:53.518 --> 31:57.140
Doesn't really seem like the
dad who's looking to reconnect.

31:58.377 --> 31:59.597
How would I know?

32:00.256 --> 32:01.709
Well you're with him, aren't you?

32:07.635 --> 32:09.925
You have an interesting aura.

32:10.533 --> 32:12.398
Oh, yeah? And what's it say?

32:16.673 --> 32:18.161
It says...

32:19.554 --> 32:20.885
"Don't look at me.

32:21.544 --> 32:22.964
I'm the dumb one."

32:23.680 --> 32:25.800
It says you follow instead of lead.

32:27.550 --> 32:28.921
Except sex.

32:29.221 --> 32:30.969
That's your superpower, huh?

32:33.490 --> 32:35.224
You asking me if I'm any good?

32:35.425 --> 32:36.810
I know you are.

32:39.295 --> 32:40.888
But you're hiding behind it.

32:41.685 --> 32:42.700
Hiding from what?

32:45.502 --> 32:46.662
I don't know...

32:48.785 --> 32:50.069
but I'm interested.

32:51.574 --> 32:53.516
You have to be smart to be good at it.

32:53.976 --> 32:56.422
Figure out what a person
wants, give it to them.

32:57.714 --> 32:59.914
Good sex is spiritual.

32:59.916 --> 33:01.239
Psychological.

33:02.252 --> 33:04.059
Gotta know what makes a person tick,

33:04.254 --> 33:07.121
what they're ashamed of, what
they hate about themselves,

33:07.123 --> 33:09.441
what they wish other people could see.

33:11.928 --> 33:13.564
All right, so...

33:16.599 --> 33:17.945
what are you doing with Billy?

33:18.105 --> 33:19.252
The dude's a loser.

33:20.603 --> 33:21.910
- Billy?
- Yeah.

33:22.707 --> 33:25.740
Billy's... just my ride.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.714
He's just your ride. All right.

33:50.065 --> 33:51.686
I didn't know you sponsored surfers.

33:54.444 --> 33:57.371
Yeah. I couldn't afford to
stay on the tour, so I...

33:57.583 --> 33:58.959
And we grew up together.

33:59.469 --> 34:00.913
You grew up together?

34:02.913 --> 34:03.839
Yeah.

34:07.049 --> 34:07.982
What?

34:12.128 --> 34:13.387
Well, I'm not an idiot.

34:15.792 --> 34:16.775
It's cool.

34:17.536 --> 34:18.657
Believe it or not,

34:18.688 --> 34:20.578
you're not the first
person I've had sex with.

34:22.983 --> 34:24.483
It was a long time ago.

34:45.570 --> 34:46.771
Where have you been?

34:48.464 --> 34:49.498
I've been busy.

34:50.092 --> 34:51.293
You see this?

34:55.364 --> 34:58.833
That's what happens when
you don't answer my calls.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.690
Did you visit our friends in Arizona?

35:09.687 --> 35:10.623
No.

35:11.381 --> 35:14.282
When I tell you to do something,

35:14.282 --> 35:16.842
I am not asking.

35:19.589 --> 35:21.656
Smurf, I'm the only
reason that that black eye

35:21.658 --> 35:23.457
isn't an everyday occurrence.

35:23.459 --> 35:24.592
Watch yourself.

35:24.594 --> 35:26.393
I'm the only one that visits you,

35:26.729 --> 35:29.031
the only one that gives a
shit that you're in here.

35:30.283 --> 35:31.894
If I stop coming,

35:32.735 --> 35:34.429
you're gonna die in here.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.714
What are you doing here?

36:56.119 --> 36:57.154
What did you do?

37:29.152 --> 37:31.396
I'm willing to take your terms to the DA,

37:32.088 --> 37:34.166
but three years isn't gonna cut it.

37:35.225 --> 37:37.983
You plead to arranging
the Javi Cano murder,

37:38.828 --> 37:40.736
you'll do 8 to 10 in Donovan,

37:41.431 --> 37:44.214
but I need real crimes on your boys.

37:51.841 --> 37:55.376
You got some set of balls, Pearce.

37:55.378 --> 37:56.510
I'll give you that.

37:56.512 --> 37:58.622
8 to 10 is a steal, Janine.

37:59.115 --> 38:01.583
Iwata wants to put you away
for the rest of your life.

38:01.585 --> 38:04.053
I think your witness testimony

38:04.053 --> 38:05.745
is bullshit.

38:06.256 --> 38:08.322
There is no way you'd come in here

38:08.324 --> 38:10.458
offering me an eight-year vacation

38:10.460 --> 38:12.434
if you had anything real.

38:12.862 --> 38:14.708
Is that a risk you want to take?

38:15.932 --> 38:18.633
My boys are pillars of their community.

38:19.202 --> 38:22.239
Andrew did his time. He's reformed.

38:22.681 --> 38:24.793
Deran is a small-business owner.

38:24.941 --> 38:28.465
Craig manages the family
properties, and J...

38:29.545 --> 38:31.613
J is just a kid.

38:37.421 --> 38:38.742
I'll see you tomorrow...

38:39.355 --> 38:40.579
in court.

38:46.696 --> 38:48.496
Yo. What's up, man?

38:48.689 --> 38:50.298
- You good?
- Yeah.

38:50.300 --> 38:51.371
Got my paperwork?

38:52.836 --> 38:53.928
Thanks, man.

38:54.170 --> 38:55.837
You guys running drugs or something?

38:55.839 --> 38:57.295
Nah. Nothing like that.

38:57.650 --> 39:00.168
It's around the corner.
Temp control's in the cab.

39:00.310 --> 39:01.610
- Just change the plates.
- _

39:19.078 --> 39:20.886
- Hey.
- Can I come in?

39:21.865 --> 39:23.064
Yeah.

39:25.583 --> 39:27.883
I, uh... I didn't realize

39:27.908 --> 39:29.655
you were in town.

39:30.139 --> 39:31.605
Uh, yeah.

39:31.607 --> 39:32.743
I just, uh...

39:33.009 --> 39:34.772
I just flew in for a couple days.

39:35.011 --> 39:36.284
Jess had the baby.

39:36.633 --> 39:38.143
Oh, shit. Really?

39:38.916 --> 39:40.122
You're an uncle.

39:41.245 --> 39:42.770
The kid is so ugly. It's crazy.

39:44.496 --> 39:46.830
Made it to the, uh, quarters in Hossegor.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.833
I know. I saw. Congrats.

39:48.835 --> 39:51.102
You smoked Conner. I bet he lost his shit.

39:51.104 --> 39:52.203
Thanks.

39:55.908 --> 39:57.442
Is Chad here, or...

39:57.444 --> 39:59.243
No, he's gone for the weekend.

39:59.245 --> 40:00.977
He let me stay in my old room.

40:02.048 --> 40:03.365
Jet lag's a bitch.

40:03.582 --> 40:06.431
I've been in like seven different
time zones in the last three weeks.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.536
Keeps me awake.

40:08.536 --> 40:09.973
You want some?

40:11.257 --> 40:15.002
No. I, uh... I'm good. I
actually can't stay too long.

40:17.730 --> 40:18.928
Uh...

40:22.335 --> 40:23.904
You're a motocross fan now?

40:26.072 --> 40:27.485
Clark Lincoln, huh?

40:28.699 --> 40:30.019
I didn't know he was gay.

40:32.907 --> 40:36.374
"This is, uh... just a... surfer

40:36.399 --> 40:37.557
that I sponsor."

40:38.650 --> 40:40.108
Shut up.

40:44.997 --> 40:46.403
We always sucked at timing.

40:47.685 --> 40:48.844
How's that going?

40:52.871 --> 40:54.390
I don't know. It's...

40:55.660 --> 40:56.859
We're having fun.

40:56.884 --> 40:58.098
It's just...

40:59.508 --> 41:00.908
It's fun, I guess.

41:04.198 --> 41:06.469
But he started asking about Smurf.

41:08.512 --> 41:09.625
What'd you tell him?

41:10.603 --> 41:12.083
That I barely talk to her.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.200
Well, that's sort of true.

41:16.354 --> 41:17.750
Yeah, I guess.

41:37.321 --> 41:38.477
Let's go.

41:40.299 --> 41:41.705
Where are my clothes?

41:42.082 --> 41:43.626
You have to talk to the desk.

41:45.690 --> 41:46.818
Let's go.

42:02.108 --> 42:03.363
Take a seat.

42:10.481 --> 42:12.156
What time does the van come?

42:13.383 --> 42:15.984
Where are my clothes? I have court today.

42:16.772 --> 42:18.141
I don't know anything about it.

42:27.359 --> 42:28.462
Janine Cody?

42:29.795 --> 42:30.795
Take it.

42:31.793 --> 42:32.865
Check it.

42:37.546 --> 42:38.623
Signature?

42:44.364 --> 42:46.079
Congratulations. You're going home.

43:05.063 --> 43:07.463
Now, do me a favor and
stay out of Pope's way, will you?

43:07.616 --> 43:10.040
You know, most people actually like me.

43:11.001 --> 43:12.645
Yep. Okay.

43:13.726 --> 43:15.120
You're comfortable in the truck?

43:15.167 --> 43:16.312
No problem.

43:16.948 --> 43:18.285
You sure about this?

43:18.893 --> 43:20.639
Yeah. She'll be fine.

43:20.641 --> 43:22.419
Just keep your mouth shut. Get in, get out.

43:22.444 --> 43:24.175
Text Billy when you're done, all right?

43:24.177 --> 43:26.110
- Sure.
- Let's do this.

43:35.788 --> 43:37.455
- You good?
- Yeah. I just don't like

43:37.457 --> 43:39.457
taking risks with people I don't know.

43:39.459 --> 43:41.860
Man, you told me to handle
Billy, so I handled him.

43:41.862 --> 43:43.794
Gonna be fine. Just keep
an eye on him in the car,

43:43.796 --> 43:45.063
and all she's got to do is drive.

43:45.065 --> 43:46.258
We'll be good.

44:53.466 --> 44:55.830
Iwata dropped the charges, huh?
