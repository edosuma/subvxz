WEBVTT

01:27.750 --> 01:31.447
Mr. chen, we have reviewed your resume.

01:31.708 --> 01:34.370
You have seen a great deal of life,

01:35.125 --> 01:36.434
but about your teaching experience...

01:36.458 --> 01:37.938
Actually, I have never taught before.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.489
We have a lot of troubled students
in our school.

01:43.875 --> 01:46.241
We need someone experienced.

01:46.500 --> 01:48.365
I think our school is not suitable for you.

01:49.083 --> 01:50.948
I could write you a reference letter.

01:51.167 --> 01:52.567
Why don't you go try other schools?

01:52.625 --> 01:53.705
Excuse me, principal lin.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.908
Long hours, no allowance.

02:16.083 --> 02:19.575
Extremely low pay.

02:19.750 --> 02:20.284
Think carefully.

02:20.375 --> 02:21.615
I will do the cleaning as well.

02:21.958 --> 02:23.869
School starts at 8.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.907
Don't be late on the first day of school.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.625
Mr. chen.

02:28.708 --> 02:31.324
Why would you like to be a teacher here?

02:34.125 --> 02:35.525
See you on the first day of school.

02:50.042 --> 02:51.373
Up all night again?

02:51.458 --> 02:53.198
We are late! Brush up and get changed!

02:53.292 --> 02:54.407
I'm almost done!

02:55.792 --> 02:56.872
Hey, give it back.

03:06.042 --> 03:06.906
Seriously?

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Yes.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.698
Hey, still mad?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.573
Save it.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.956
Let's get going.

03:33.542 --> 03:34.281
Uncle long.

03:34.417 --> 03:36.533
My dad asked me to cash
in these concert tickets.

03:37.167 --> 03:38.607
What are you doing? Are you dealing?

03:38.792 --> 03:39.792
Stand on the side!

03:39.917 --> 03:41.703
What's in your bag? Open it.

03:43.833 --> 03:44.913
There's nothing inside, sir

03:46.125 --> 03:47.160
alright, run along now.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.233
What are you looking at, over here.

03:58.917 --> 03:59.917
Come, have breakfast.

03:59.958 --> 04:01.198
Gotta get to school, I'll pass.

04:01.292 --> 04:02.492
Don't forget the pocket money.

04:02.792 --> 04:03.907
Hey, and don't mix it up.

04:04.042 --> 04:05.893
The five hundred dollar note
is for your brother.

04:05.917 --> 04:07.237
Why is he getting more than I do?

04:07.292 --> 04:09.374
He is a boy.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.328
He needs it more than you.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.368
Unfair!

04:26.375 --> 04:27.285
Grandma, I'm heading out to school.

04:27.375 --> 04:29.206
I fixed your shoes.

04:29.292 --> 04:30.623
I told you it's fine.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.991
The restaurant paid me yesterday,
I'll get a new pair.

04:33.542 --> 04:34.577
Pay the rent today.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.523
Better hurry before someone bugs us.

04:53.542 --> 04:54.452
Good morning, class.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.329
Good morning, Ms. liang.

04:59.583 --> 05:02.245
Fourteen, just enough.

05:02.333 --> 05:05.200
Spacious and no need for class reduction.

05:05.292 --> 05:08.910
A new school year starts.
Be prepared to do mock papers everyday.

05:09.125 --> 05:09.784
Keep in mind.

05:09.958 --> 05:11.869
You all have only one goal for this year.

05:11.958 --> 05:13.643
It is to Ace the dse.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.328
School ends at three forty-five.

05:15.417 --> 05:18.739
I have to be ready to go at three-thirty.

05:18.958 --> 05:22.746
Punctuality is an important virtue
to every secondary school student.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.542
Good morning.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.074
Good morning, class 6b.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.073
Good morning.

05:41.583 --> 05:42.868
Pay first.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.744
I'll give you more msg.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.618
You put the entire packet of msg in?

05:54.625 --> 05:55.330
What?

05:55.333 --> 05:58.780
Do you know there's 1000 to 2000 milligram
of sodium in every packet of msg?

05:58.875 --> 06:01.684
Which exceeds the reference daily intake
standards of the world health organization.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.976
Meaning you will have high blood pressure
from consuming too much sodium.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.101
I suggest that you put
at most one-third of it in only.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.786
Eat up and put your things away.

06:08.625 --> 06:09.625
What the hell...

06:13.292 --> 06:15.908
You should tune the g string first
and then the a string.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.448
Do...

06:18.750 --> 06:20.411
Yes, pitch perfect.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.250
Good stuff.

06:24.375 --> 06:25.375
You know about cars?

06:25.417 --> 06:27.783
This is a great one,
top speed of 307 kilometers per hour.

06:27.917 --> 06:30.476
However, the speed limit in Hong Kong is
110 kilometers per hour.

06:30.500 --> 06:33.620
Over 100,000 speeding tickets have already
been issued by the police this year.

06:33.833 --> 06:37.200
So, drive safely when you get
your driving license in the future. Ok?

06:39.875 --> 06:40.660
Are you done?

06:40.792 --> 06:42.559
Stop bugging me,
I'm gonna break the highest score!

06:42.583 --> 06:45.893
Do you know the specific absorption rate of a
mobile phone ranges from 0.27 to 0.58 w/kg?

06:45.917 --> 06:47.518
I am using an anti-radiation
screen protector.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.422
Just the screen is not enough,
you gotta wrap it around the entire phone.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.781
If you have to use it,
take a break every fifteen minutes.

06:53.917 --> 06:54.917
Wake up.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.365
Good morning.

07:02.208 --> 07:05.951
Starting today, I am your class teacher
and liberal studies teacher.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.911
I am Henry chen.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.869
I lived in the states for a while.

07:09.917 --> 07:12.033
My Chinese name is chen xia.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.952
Chen xia?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.289
Chen is the surname.

07:19.208 --> 07:20.994
Look, he's got a tattoo.

07:23.167 --> 07:23.997
Chen xia?

07:24.000 --> 07:25.581
This is my number.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.617
Have been living abroad for too long.
I can't even write Chinese properly.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.393
Don't call me if it's not an emergency.

07:34.458 --> 07:35.698
What is he writing?

07:38.667 --> 07:40.874
- Hello?
- Henry, save it.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.664
What are you doing, sir?

08:10.125 --> 08:11.125
Everybody.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.573
Welcome to my class.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.082
What is the new teacher's name? Mr. chen?

08:22.125 --> 08:23.893
First day around and
already looking for troubles.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.434
Good that my phone case is water-proof.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.994
Else, my phone should have been dead.

08:27.208 --> 08:29.824
Dared to mess up my breakfast business...

08:30.208 --> 08:33.280
We cannot just let it be.
We have to do something.

08:33.375 --> 08:35.832
Relax. He will be gone in one week.

08:35.957 --> 08:39.325
Most of you didn't do well
in the mock test today.

08:40.667 --> 08:43.409
Write the model answers ten times.

08:44.792 --> 08:47.864
There's no better way to memorize than
writing it over and over again.

08:47.875 --> 08:48.875
Got it?

08:49.208 --> 08:50.688
Jenn got the highest score this time.

08:51.208 --> 08:53.328
Ask her if there's anything that
you don't understand.

08:55.375 --> 08:58.617
Hey, he is checking jenn out!
She's the beauty queen!

08:59.125 --> 09:00.285
- Here...
- Nice, dude.

09:00.375 --> 09:02.161
Did he do anything bad with the photogragh?

09:03.125 --> 09:04.125
Let's see

09:05.167 --> 09:06.167
give me back.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.915
What smell is this?

09:09.833 --> 09:11.118
What a smell...

09:11.333 --> 09:12.809
Of course it smells,
look at all these trash here.

09:12.833 --> 09:13.948
What are you saying?

09:14.208 --> 09:17.405
Nowadays, the pressure is
real for students who have low grades

09:17.667 --> 09:19.282
so, they smoke their stress away here.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.873
Let's see how their teacher's
gonna save them this time.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.365
Got it, I will report to
their class teacher right away.

09:22.375 --> 09:23.956
You think results are everything?

09:24.250 --> 09:25.330
You gonna tell on us, Jake?

09:25.375 --> 09:26.615
- Bob! Catch it!
- Yes!

09:27.000 --> 09:28.800
- Hey, what are you doing?
- You want a fight?

09:29.708 --> 09:30.413
You wanna fight?

09:30.542 --> 09:31.582
It could get you expelled.

09:32.792 --> 09:35.374
Don't set your filthy foot
on basketball team premises again.

09:37.792 --> 09:38.372
Let's practise.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.123
Ok, let's practise...

09:44.917 --> 09:45.997
Guard...

09:51.125 --> 09:52.661
Hey, it's your girl.

09:55.708 --> 09:57.244
Run! Not walk!

09:58.708 --> 10:00.949
Run! Cover up, cover up!

10:15.792 --> 10:18.454
Oh... need to ask your mom to pick you up?

10:18.667 --> 10:20.157
You got what you deserve, idiot.

10:20.875 --> 10:21.910
Aren't you all cool?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.619
Your fangirls better not see you like this.

10:23.625 --> 10:24.785
You...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
Jack.

10:27.542 --> 10:30.500
You five come with me to the office and
write the school rules ten times.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.539
Penalty? For what?

10:36.917 --> 10:40.114
What now? Do we do it for real?
That's a lot...

10:40.250 --> 10:42.290
I am not doing it.
I still have to go to work later.

10:43.375 --> 10:44.865
Hey, what can we do then?

10:54.625 --> 10:55.831
Ms. liang, I'm done.

10:56.625 --> 10:58.707
- Already?
- Yup.

10:58.833 --> 11:00.243
Alright then, hurry home.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.535
Are you alright, Ms. liang?

11:13.417 --> 11:14.937
I hope we didn't scare you, Ms. liang?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.101
Don't stay behind for too long.

11:16.125 --> 11:17.205
Goodbye, Ms. liang.

11:32.667 --> 11:33.667
Chief huang,

11:34.125 --> 11:36.476
it is our honor to have you here today
for our school evaluation.

11:36.500 --> 11:40.823
Tak chi secondary school cannot measure up
to the other elite schools in the district,

11:41.167 --> 11:42.452
but we have a long history.

11:42.708 --> 11:45.165
If the education bureau
could Grant us more funding,

11:45.333 --> 11:46.573
I'm sure we can do much better.

11:47.625 --> 11:50.412
Another word for historical is obsolete.

11:51.708 --> 11:53.949
Obsolete means only to be
eliminated in the end, right?

11:58.042 --> 11:59.122
Here he comes...

11:59.708 --> 12:00.868
Everyone have your camera on!

12:14.375 --> 12:16.286
Who came up with this
crappy idea to prank me?

12:16.875 --> 12:18.035
If you want to skip my class,

12:22.250 --> 12:23.956
it is easy.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.768
Just answer my three questions correctly

12:26.792 --> 12:28.578
and I will let you go.

12:29.125 --> 12:30.661
Don't bluff, Mr. chen.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.035
I don't like bluffing.

12:32.125 --> 12:34.085
I knew a few students in my class
smoke at school.

12:37.292 --> 12:38.748
Jack, give me a pack of cigarettes.

12:40.958 --> 12:42.398
Relax, I am not going to punish you.

12:46.625 --> 12:47.625
My first question.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.283
Do you know what are
the chemical constituents of cigarettes?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
Nicotine.

12:52.125 --> 12:52.989
You didn't raise your hand.

12:53.083 --> 12:53.617
Nicotine.

12:53.792 --> 12:54.406
And?

12:54.667 --> 12:55.281
Tar.

12:55.375 --> 12:55.989
Anymore?

12:56.000 --> 12:57.786
Carbon monoxide.

12:58.042 --> 12:59.998
Correct. You may leave now.

13:00.042 --> 13:00.701
Seriously?

13:00.792 --> 13:01.372
Of course.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.197
Can I really go?

13:02.208 --> 13:03.208
Just go!

13:06.125 --> 13:07.740
You guys enjoy class, bye!

13:07.750 --> 13:12.915
I wanna go too...

13:12.917 --> 13:15.249
Yeah... no class for me.

13:15.500 --> 13:21.700
I wanna go too...

13:21.708 --> 13:23.369
Bye...

13:25.083 --> 13:27.244
You are only excused from this class.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.865
Be back on time when the class's over.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.490
Anyone else wants to go early?

13:30.958 --> 13:33.665
Chief, let's continue in the meeting room.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.118
Second question.

13:37.792 --> 13:39.999
The second question is, can anyone tell me

13:40.208 --> 13:43.075
what are the parts of a cigarette?

13:43.750 --> 13:44.750
I know!

13:45.042 --> 13:47.124
Br... Bruce

13:47.417 --> 13:49.203
tobacco filler, cigarette paper and filter.

13:49.292 --> 13:50.292
That's right.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.614
Correct. A cigarette is
made up of three parts,

13:53.875 --> 13:56.457
cigarette paper, tobacco
filler and the filter.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.662
What's special about the filter?

13:59.750 --> 14:01.160
It must be cotton.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.167
Nonsense.

14:03.417 --> 14:04.417
A filter is hollow.

14:04.458 --> 14:04.992
Not entirely correct.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.072
It is also made of tobacco.

14:06.083 --> 14:06.868
Wrong.

14:06.917 --> 14:08.782
There are weird little holes on the filter.

14:08.875 --> 14:09.875
How is it weird?

14:10.708 --> 14:11.868
- How do I know?
- Found it.

14:11.875 --> 14:13.706
According to Wikipedia,

14:13.792 --> 14:16.329
the small holes on the
filter draw in fresh air

14:16.333 --> 14:18.933
to reduce the amount of harmful substances,
like nicotine inhaled.

14:19.250 --> 14:20.535
It doesn't say weird on it.

14:21.917 --> 14:22.952
Are you lying to us?

14:23.042 --> 14:27.411
I am not lying, it's the
tobacconists lying.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.659
Jack.

14:28.750 --> 14:31.787
Please show us how do
you smoke a cigarette.

14:32.375 --> 14:33.865
Cool...

14:37.500 --> 14:38.500
Enough.

14:39.208 --> 14:40.208
You can sit down.

14:40.583 --> 14:43.450
Just now, in the demonstration,

14:43.458 --> 14:45.538
Jack clamped onto
these small holes with two fingers.

14:45.875 --> 14:50.539
Clamping on the filter
will allow less air get in,

14:51.333 --> 14:56.407
this way the nicotine intake will be
different from what it says on the box.

14:56.542 --> 14:57.782
You will then be addicted.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.809
When you are addicted,
you will continue to pay for cigarettes.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.184
What if we continue to pay for them?

15:01.208 --> 15:04.951
Do you know the annual profits of the

15:05.250 --> 15:09.539
top six tobacconists in the world is
35 billion us dollars?

15:09.542 --> 15:12.454
That much? Really?

15:12.750 --> 15:14.160
Data tells us that

15:14.750 --> 15:17.412
every cigarette you smoke

15:17.417 --> 15:20.409
deducts fourteen minutes from you lifespan.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.573
Smokers fear no death.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.581
Dying is fine, everyone will die one day.

15:24.667 --> 15:27.059
However, there's nothing worse than
dying and not knowing why, right?

15:27.083 --> 15:31.031
You jump from science
to economy to philosophy...

15:31.375 --> 15:32.581
It's hard for us to follow.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.351
You are a liberal studies
teacher, aren't you?

15:34.375 --> 15:36.175
I think you are liberating
our minds too far.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.448
That's not what I meant to,

15:37.500 --> 15:39.286
I am training you to think critically,

15:39.375 --> 15:41.787
to have your own judgement
so that you won't be fooled.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.327
The more knowledgeable you are,

15:43.750 --> 15:45.615
the more analytical you become.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.750
Knowledge is power.

15:49.167 --> 15:50.327
Knowledge is power

15:50.708 --> 15:52.268
I am not asking you to know everything.

15:52.542 --> 15:54.703
I just want you all
to have the ability to judge.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.243
What a chance!

16:01.125 --> 16:02.786
In these few years,

16:03.042 --> 16:05.482
almost none of your students
got admitted to any universities.

16:05.917 --> 16:08.875
The enrollment in the past two years
were severely insufficient,

16:08.958 --> 16:10.243
less than fifty in total.

16:10.542 --> 16:13.579
According to the education
bureau standards,

16:16.833 --> 16:20.246
if the enrollment situation
persists next year,

16:21.333 --> 16:24.166
we will terminate the funding.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.494
Meaning, the closure of your school.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.417
Chief huang,

16:28.667 --> 16:31.625
by any chance we could settle this
at the discretion of the bureau?

16:33.917 --> 16:34.917
Good luck

16:40.083 --> 16:42.324
Ok, that's it for today. Dismiss.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.413
Just a reminder,

16:44.792 --> 16:48.080
before you go, I need
all my cigarettes back.

16:50.292 --> 16:51.407
Go...

16:51.500 --> 16:53.786
I don't care if you smoke outside,

16:54.042 --> 16:55.184
but we are on school premises.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.540
I hope all of you will
show some respect for that.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.248
I am taking this away.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.083
Captain.

17:15.666 --> 17:16.666
Trash...

17:16.708 --> 17:18.949
Hey, over here, got seats here.

17:19.708 --> 17:21.448
You really love coke?

17:22.666 --> 17:25.124
Bottles? It's slippery.

17:29.792 --> 17:31.018
Watch where you're going.
Stop playing while you walk.

17:31.042 --> 17:33.954
- What are you doing?
- You wanna fight?

17:34.417 --> 17:35.497
- You want a fight?
- Don't you touch her!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.161
Hit me! What...

17:37.458 --> 17:38.573
Shut up!

17:39.125 --> 17:42.947
Didn't your parents teach you not to
fight in public when you were little?

17:43.042 --> 17:44.042
Oh, right.

17:44.167 --> 17:47.079
I forgot some of you
don't even have parents.

17:47.167 --> 17:47.906
Shut up!

17:47.958 --> 17:48.958
What did you just say?

17:53.875 --> 17:55.206
Stop it.

17:55.750 --> 17:56.990
I have borne with you for long.

18:18.792 --> 18:19.792
Principal.

18:22.958 --> 18:24.198
There's no need for discussion.

18:24.958 --> 18:28.118
The five students in your class who took
part in the fight are getting expelled.

18:30.625 --> 18:31.865
Stop it.

18:33.333 --> 18:34.368
Move...

18:35.292 --> 18:36.292
Stop it!

18:36.458 --> 18:37.458
Stop fighting!

18:38.792 --> 18:39.792
Stop it!

18:40.167 --> 18:41.327
Stop...

18:41.542 --> 18:44.079
Hey... stop.

18:44.083 --> 18:45.083
You! Stop it!

18:47.917 --> 18:49.117
He said I don't have a mother.

18:49.208 --> 18:50.726
That's right, you don't even have a mother.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.750
Say it again if you dare!

18:52.833 --> 18:54.619
Calm down! Stop!

18:55.292 --> 18:56.828
I don't care whose fault it is.

18:56.958 --> 18:58.078
Fighting is in no way right.

18:58.333 --> 18:59.539
I don't want anymore nonsense.

18:59.708 --> 19:01.573
Tell me, we all took
part in the fight today.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.536
Why are we the only ones getting expelled?

19:03.792 --> 19:04.792
Why?

19:05.458 --> 19:07.414
It is because the world
is unfair like that!

19:09.625 --> 19:10.625
Are you done?

19:11.042 --> 19:12.042
Are you throwing a fit?

19:12.208 --> 19:13.038
You are so cool.

19:13.208 --> 19:15.164
If you think the world isn't fair,

19:15.292 --> 19:18.059
starting from now, you should do your best
in this class and in this school,

19:18.083 --> 19:20.825
let everyone know you are better than that.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.625
Let's go, Ms. liang.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.866
Here are five letters of repentance.

19:31.667 --> 19:34.739
The school is giving you all
one last chance, think about it.

19:36.250 --> 19:37.250
I'll leave them here.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.828
Everyone gets back to class,

19:40.917 --> 19:42.101
aren't you tired of all the standing?

19:42.125 --> 19:42.784
Come on...

19:42.917 --> 19:44.157
Let's go back to class.

19:44.292 --> 19:45.292
Let's resume class.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.331
Go...

20:28.125 --> 20:29.125
Ms. liang,

20:29.333 --> 20:31.693
taking too much instant noodles are
no good for your health.

20:34.542 --> 20:35.542
Thank you.

20:38.917 --> 20:39.622
Mr. chen,

20:39.708 --> 20:42.324
you should take a look if you have time.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Thank you.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.832
My name is faiyaz ahan.
You can call me Gordon.

21:24.167 --> 21:26.624
My hometown is Karachi, Pakistan.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.454
But I was born in Hong Kong,
so I'm a hongkonger.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.536
Ever since I was little, I like singing.

21:35.875 --> 21:38.156
I remember competing in
singing contests when I was a kid.

21:38.792 --> 21:40.552
People burst out laughing
every time I sing.

21:40.708 --> 21:41.538
I thought...

21:41.625 --> 21:42.740
Why doing so?

21:43.250 --> 21:46.330
It turns out, my Chinese is so good,
they think it doesn't match my skin tone.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.162
Everyone thinks I am different.

21:50.458 --> 21:53.825
Some even consider us terrorists
because of our skin tone.

21:54.875 --> 21:57.393
The truth is, our family set foot in
Hong Kong since my grandpa's generation.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.624
Your culture is part of who we are.

22:00.125 --> 22:02.537
I want to become
a canto-pop singer in the future,

22:02.750 --> 22:04.310
and people will accept me for who I am.

22:09.958 --> 22:11.226
I am Gladys, my Chinese name is wang denan.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.035
From my name,

22:12.083 --> 22:14.415
you could guess how eager my dad
would like to have a son.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.167
But, it's all good.

22:16.583 --> 22:18.744
My brother was born five years later.

22:19.042 --> 22:21.283
To dad, it was better
than winning the lottery.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.184
He always said he loves us the same,

22:23.208 --> 22:24.994
in fact he loves only my brother.

22:25.167 --> 22:27.909
I grew up hating myself for being a girl.

22:28.083 --> 22:29.723
I started to wear my hair short ages ago.

22:30.333 --> 22:31.698
Not a person in this family

22:31.833 --> 22:33.198
cared about my feelings.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.369
They don't even know what I like.

22:35.958 --> 22:38.825
They thought I like stuff toys
and playing house.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.869
In fact, I like cars the most.

22:41.667 --> 22:43.282
My dream is to become

22:43.333 --> 22:45.119
a formula one racer.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.125
My name is Chris.

23:01.583 --> 23:02.868
When I was eight,

23:03.583 --> 23:06.040
my mother went away
with a man with a golden watch...

23:07.125 --> 23:09.491
Is mommy never coming back?

23:10.000 --> 23:11.456
You two, shut up!

23:12.167 --> 23:14.374
I don't have a family anymore
from that day onwards.

23:14.958 --> 23:18.075
However, I found somewhere way
more interesting.

23:18.333 --> 23:22.326
A place where you can start
all over again when you lose,

23:22.833 --> 23:24.744
unlike the cruel reality.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.704
All roads can lead to Rome.

23:28.042 --> 23:31.239
I can be a world champion here.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.167
My name is Bruce.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.036
Obviously, Chris and I are twins.

23:37.042 --> 23:39.078
Wake up! Go get me liquor!

23:40.167 --> 23:41.327
I will go get them for you.

23:41.542 --> 23:44.579
But I was diagnosed with attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.658
I have difficulties concentrating.

23:47.042 --> 23:49.283
Erm... and with my crazy alcoholic father,

23:49.625 --> 23:52.367
making a mess at home everyday.

23:52.583 --> 23:54.494
All you know is gaming... let's go.

23:54.542 --> 23:55.998
Apart from the housing issue,

23:56.250 --> 23:59.617
I still have to take care of my brother,
how am I supposed to study?

24:00.833 --> 24:02.448
Give it a break, it's time to eat.

24:05.042 --> 24:06.042
Go get liquor for me.

24:08.083 --> 24:08.788
What are you waiting for?

24:08.833 --> 24:11.996
No matter how hard it is,
I will study hard and earn more money.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.665
I will then move out with my brother

24:14.750 --> 24:16.350
and break free from my alcoholic father.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.407
For Jack and the other kids,

24:20.458 --> 24:22.018
the fact that
they got into a fight is a problem,

24:22.042 --> 24:23.684
but it doesn't mean we
have to give up on them.

24:23.708 --> 24:26.199
If we teachers are
to give up on these students,

24:26.458 --> 24:28.393
aren't they more geared
to giving up on themselves.

24:28.417 --> 24:29.873
Each year, the education bureau

24:29.917 --> 24:33.364
evaluates the banding of a school

24:33.500 --> 24:36.116
according to the results of its students.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.684
If we want to keep the school running,

24:37.708 --> 24:40.245
we need more students like Jake

24:40.292 --> 24:42.578
to score good in the public examinations.

24:43.417 --> 24:46.989
If only twenty percent of the students
in Hong Kong get admitted,

24:47.333 --> 24:49.039
what about the other eighty?

24:49.458 --> 24:50.458
Do we give them up?

24:50.625 --> 24:52.286
The majority serving the minority?

24:52.708 --> 24:53.788
We, educators,

24:53.917 --> 24:55.893
are not here to teach students
how to take examintions.

24:55.917 --> 24:58.499
Rather, we should be enlightening them
to take their own paths.

24:58.542 --> 25:02.239
Nowadays, education is all about scoring
high and getting into elite schools.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.036
The students are pressured,

25:04.167 --> 25:05.407
so am I.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.992
Must we drift along
with this ridiculous social norm?

25:09.333 --> 25:11.073
I think if we are to educate,

25:11.583 --> 25:13.039
we must have our own beliefs.

25:13.708 --> 25:15.699
All are educable. All can be successful.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.536
This is our school motto.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.768
Did you say you can come work earlier
if you need not go to school?

25:40.792 --> 25:41.792
You had everyone waiting.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.534
Get to work!

25:42.583 --> 25:44.164
Here... more tea.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.869
Alright... over there.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.615
Come on... hit me from the left.

25:50.667 --> 25:52.373
- Left!
- Dodge!

25:54.625 --> 25:55.625
Boss zhang,

25:55.750 --> 25:57.581
you really can fight.

25:58.667 --> 26:00.434
- You are flattering me.
- You can be a boxing champion.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.243
Hello.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.618
Take a seat...

26:04.250 --> 26:07.993
Boss zhang, you are born to be a boxer.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.207
You are flattering me.

26:12.292 --> 26:13.292
Simon.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.458
Look at this.

26:17.667 --> 26:22.957
This piece of land is
good for developing luxury houses.

26:23.292 --> 26:25.453
There is a tak chi secondary school here,

26:25.750 --> 26:27.081
you know where it is?

26:27.417 --> 26:28.122
I think so.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.167
So you know.

26:29.667 --> 26:33.239
The school will be scuttled by the
government by the end of the year.

26:33.625 --> 26:38.494
After that, we could acquire the land
and develop it.

26:38.708 --> 26:41.871
However, there's a lot
of small shops around.

26:41.917 --> 26:44.954
For all those ownerships...
And messy trivia,

26:45.083 --> 26:46.226
you know how to deal with them, right?

26:46.250 --> 26:49.572
I won't disappoint you, boss.

26:52.125 --> 26:53.615
Cheers...

26:54.625 --> 26:55.865
Hey, one more.

26:56.583 --> 26:57.583
Game on!

26:57.750 --> 27:05.748
Go... go...

27:07.833 --> 27:09.289
You've won!

27:09.458 --> 27:11.198
Congrats, boss zhang.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.448
Will come and drink again next time.

27:22.583 --> 27:25.495
Of course. Be careful...

27:26.958 --> 27:30.121
Remember to practise
at the boxing gym tomorrow at 9.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.372
Bye.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.456
Bye, see you tomorrow.

27:39.833 --> 27:40.833
Got a light?

27:41.250 --> 27:42.250
What?

27:43.458 --> 27:45.198
Dared to steal from my boss?

27:48.833 --> 27:50.243
Dared to steal from my boss?

27:50.958 --> 27:52.323
Crawl along!

27:52.792 --> 27:53.792
Keep moving!

27:58.417 --> 28:00.157
Did your mum ever told you not to steal?

28:00.292 --> 28:01.532
Kill me if you dare!

28:03.625 --> 28:04.956
A tough one, huh?

28:06.542 --> 28:07.702
What's your name?

28:07.958 --> 28:09.494
It's none of your business. Stupid!

28:15.542 --> 28:18.579
Jack, student of tak chi secondary school.

28:18.875 --> 28:22.038
Why don't you study at school
and do serving tables here?

28:28.292 --> 28:30.783
You can always come to me
if you want to make money.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.580
This, you can have
as many as you wish in the future.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.365
- Bro. Long.
- What is it?

28:45.417 --> 28:46.782
Here are the concert tickets,
count them yourself.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.157
We lined up whole night for them.

28:54.958 --> 28:55.958
Hello!

28:57.167 --> 28:58.782
I am looking for Gordon.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.000
Are you his mother?

29:00.083 --> 29:00.663
Yea.

29:00.708 --> 29:01.413
I'm his teacher.

29:01.625 --> 29:02.625
Oh, really?

29:02.667 --> 29:03.452
Where is he?

29:03.542 --> 29:04.622
I think he is outside?

29:04.750 --> 29:06.786
He's outside? Ok, I go look for him.

29:06.958 --> 29:08.914
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

29:12.417 --> 29:13.532
Missing one ticket.

29:13.583 --> 29:14.698
That's not possible...

29:18.542 --> 29:20.184
- You punk!
- No! What are you looking for?

29:20.208 --> 29:21.208
No?

29:21.875 --> 29:23.115
What is this?

29:23.500 --> 29:24.615
I want to go too.

29:24.667 --> 29:25.656
You want to go?

29:25.667 --> 29:27.667
Do you know what is the price
for one of these now?

29:28.917 --> 29:30.532
Help me go get him, bro. Long.

29:30.875 --> 29:31.990
What the hell!

29:37.542 --> 29:38.542
Hey, Gordon.

29:38.917 --> 29:39.576
Mr. chen?

29:39.625 --> 29:40.410
I was looking for you.

29:40.458 --> 29:41.914
Help me, Mr. chen!

29:44.292 --> 29:44.906
Gordon.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.327
Mr. chen. It's not looking good.

29:52.167 --> 29:53.031
Excuse me.

29:53.042 --> 29:53.781
Mr. chen, what are you doing?

29:53.875 --> 29:55.018
- I'll have to borrow this.
- They are here!

29:55.042 --> 29:56.722
- I will return it later.
- Help, Mr. chen!

29:58.000 --> 29:59.456
Stand behind me...

30:01.875 --> 30:02.875
What is it...

30:08.542 --> 30:10.328
What happened?

30:11.083 --> 30:13.620
You little rascal, ganging up with
an outsider against your dad?

30:13.667 --> 30:14.622
Your dad?

30:14.625 --> 30:15.625
Yes...

30:16.458 --> 30:18.449
I'm sorry... it's a misunderstanding.

30:21.875 --> 30:24.662
Just for a scalper ticket?

30:24.792 --> 30:27.124
I stole it just
because I wanted to hear the music live.

30:27.167 --> 30:29.283
Have you thought of singing on stage?

30:29.708 --> 30:30.743
I hate singing on stage.

30:31.542 --> 30:32.542
Stage fright?

30:32.792 --> 30:33.792
Me?

30:34.167 --> 30:35.167
Yea.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.037
Why would 1?
I sing better than the pros nowadays.

30:38.083 --> 30:40.119
- For real? Don't bluff.
- For real.

30:40.375 --> 30:41.643
- Admit it...
- You aren't scared?

30:41.667 --> 30:43.601
- No way I will be scared.
- Then sing, right here.

30:43.625 --> 30:44.205
Here?

30:44.375 --> 30:45.375
Yea.

30:45.542 --> 30:46.657
Seriously?

30:47.000 --> 30:47.864
Stop messing with me...

30:47.917 --> 30:48.917
Watch me.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.250
I'll show you.

30:51.667 --> 30:54.283
If I can do it, you can do it.

30:54.333 --> 30:54.913
What?

30:55.292 --> 30:56.292
Come on.

30:57.042 --> 30:58.873
Excuse me. Let me sing for a while, may 1?

30:59.917 --> 31:01.828
Three, two, one. Go.

31:02.250 --> 31:05.287
"Look over here, the girl across me."

31:05.708 --> 31:08.780
"Look over here. Look over here."

31:09.000 --> 31:11.116
I can do it. Believe in yourself.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.448
You can do it as well. Come on!

31:12.708 --> 31:15.871
"Look over here. Look over here."

31:16.208 --> 31:19.325
"Don't be scared by the way I look."

31:23.875 --> 31:27.117
"I look to the left, look to the right,
look up and look down."

31:27.333 --> 31:30.325
"I found every girl complicated."

31:30.500 --> 31:33.822
"I think and rethink.
I guess and I guess it again."

31:34.000 --> 31:37.868
"Girls have strange
thoughts on their minds."

31:37.917 --> 31:42.081
"Strange... come on..."

32:17.500 --> 32:20.788
There is no more beer.
One of you go get it for me!

32:21.125 --> 32:22.125
Do it yourself.

32:27.042 --> 32:28.703
What did you just say?

32:30.375 --> 32:31.375
You go ahead!

32:31.500 --> 32:32.285
Go buy it yourself.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.619
I worked so hard to raise you guys.

32:34.875 --> 32:36.226
You can't even do something
easy as this for me?

32:36.250 --> 32:38.286
You work two days a week at most!

32:38.500 --> 32:39.865
When were you ever sober?

32:39.917 --> 32:40.622
Are you getting beer for me or not?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.307
No! Don't you see I am doing my homework?

32:42.458 --> 32:43.458
Homework your ass.

32:47.708 --> 32:48.914
Don't you come back!

33:08.458 --> 33:09.458
Mr. guan...

33:10.208 --> 33:11.208
Mr. guan...

33:11.750 --> 33:12.750
Hi

33:14.875 --> 33:16.411
I am the class teacher of your sons.

33:21.750 --> 33:24.287
What's up? Got queries on your assignment?

33:24.417 --> 33:25.577
You know this one?

33:28.375 --> 33:33.620
The answer is 27x-y=35.

33:33.875 --> 33:35.206
Why are you so dumb?

33:35.333 --> 33:37.164
You are the smart one,
come over to teach me.

33:39.208 --> 33:41.119
- I don't understand this one.
- X+35=28

33:41.167 --> 33:42.167
how about this one?

33:43.750 --> 33:46.241
Dumb... that's all you ever said...

33:46.292 --> 33:48.829
- You are so done...
- Help me, dad!

33:49.000 --> 33:50.960
Are you interrupting
your brother's studies again?

33:52.542 --> 33:53.542
Here,

33:53.833 --> 33:55.243
- these are yours.
- What is this?

33:55.667 --> 33:56.952
Make-up.

33:57.042 --> 33:59.922
Do you know putting make up on is
how a girl shows respect to the others?

34:00.292 --> 34:01.577
Come to lunch with me tomorrow.

34:01.667 --> 34:03.623
Lunch? I have school tomorrow!

34:03.667 --> 34:06.283
Boss zhu wants you to meet with his son.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.908
There's no problem to
know a new friend, right?

34:09.125 --> 34:10.809
Treat it as accompanying dad
to a business meeting.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.539
That's medieval. I'm not going.

34:13.250 --> 34:14.956
Since when you have a say.

34:15.167 --> 34:16.577
It's all set.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.206
Alright... stop arguing with your dad.

34:19.833 --> 34:20.947
I can't read your mind.

34:21.167 --> 34:22.202
You don't study well.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.500
Don't you see?

34:23.542 --> 34:26.864
You could be married into a good family
right after graduation.

34:27.042 --> 34:30.364
How many girls dream of that and
now you say you don't want it?

34:30.583 --> 34:33.074
Dad, perhaps Gladys still
wants to continue her studies?

34:34.292 --> 34:35.891
Would she be admitted by any university?

34:36.125 --> 34:37.534
Mind your own business

34:37.833 --> 34:39.039
and study hard.

34:39.167 --> 34:40.873
Ace the entrance examination next week.

34:40.958 --> 34:43.824
All I want is for you to study in Boston.

34:43.875 --> 34:44.875
Work hard!

34:47.875 --> 34:49.831
Do you know how to do
with the make-up, Gladys?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.034
Can try it...

35:00.167 --> 35:01.498
Your sister snuck out again?

35:03.083 --> 35:04.493
You got full marks in mathematics.

35:05.042 --> 35:06.762
Are you confident about another full score?

35:07.250 --> 35:07.784
Sure.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.323
What is this?

35:10.208 --> 35:12.039
Gladys was practising
how to put on make-up.

35:23.875 --> 35:24.875
Mr. chen?

35:25.542 --> 35:26.827
Gladys, got you finally.

35:27.708 --> 35:28.708
What are you doing?

35:29.708 --> 35:32.184
What's with it? I'm just driving my
dad's car around in the parking lot.

35:32.208 --> 35:33.664
First, you broke the law.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.080
Second, you don't have a driving license.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.893
Third, I guess your father
does not know about this,

35:36.917 --> 35:37.917
does he?

35:38.917 --> 35:40.373
I just really want to drive.

35:40.500 --> 35:41.500
Alright.

35:42.750 --> 35:44.741
You want to drive, right? No problem.

35:48.667 --> 35:50.453
Are you ready? You are up next.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.115
Of course. Aren't you racing with me?

35:52.167 --> 35:54.158
Someone will, but it's not gonna be me.

35:54.417 --> 35:55.417
Then who?

36:00.833 --> 36:01.447
It's you?

36:01.458 --> 36:02.868
I am here to race with you.

36:03.042 --> 36:04.282
If you won,

36:05.833 --> 36:07.039
if you lose,

36:07.333 --> 36:09.119
you will finish school
and then get married.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.208
No more complications.

36:10.458 --> 36:12.338
Then there's not a chance
I am getting married.

36:15.417 --> 36:16.532
Ready, go!

36:19.708 --> 36:22.745
Go... go... go... yeah...

36:29.083 --> 36:30.744
Go... yeah!

36:52.000 --> 36:53.000
Good race!

36:58.917 --> 36:59.997
Keep your words.

37:00.958 --> 37:01.958
What words?

37:02.125 --> 37:03.268
You really think you are so great?

37:03.292 --> 37:04.892
You were just driving around in circles.

37:04.917 --> 37:06.498
I still haven't said a word
about your stealing my car

37:06.500 --> 37:08.240
and drive it out of the parking lot.

37:08.500 --> 37:10.741
We will talk when you
can drive on the roads.

37:10.792 --> 37:11.792
No problem.

37:12.583 --> 37:13.583
Hey!

37:48.083 --> 37:49.789
You brat, are you done?

37:49.875 --> 37:51.595
Do you know how serious I am about driving?

37:51.625 --> 37:52.785
It is never just for fun.

37:53.042 --> 37:55.624
You told me to drive on the roads,
I am just doing as you said.

37:55.708 --> 37:56.618
Am I wrong again?

37:56.708 --> 37:59.871
Do you know how dangerous it is?

37:59.958 --> 38:01.368
So you are finally caring about me.

38:01.417 --> 38:04.409
I am worried about the car.
If you ruin it, it will cost me a fortune.

38:04.708 --> 38:07.450
Just leave me alone!

38:11.292 --> 38:13.203
Hey! Stop!

38:27.958 --> 38:28.958
Dad.

38:40.708 --> 38:45.407
Gladys... Gladys...

38:46.792 --> 38:48.783
I didn't mean to scold you.

38:49.375 --> 38:51.286
I was just eager to tell you,

38:52.042 --> 38:53.184
but you thought I was telling you off.

38:53.208 --> 38:53.947
I am not.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.536
I really do love you, Gladys...

38:55.875 --> 38:58.912
I care so much about you.

38:59.875 --> 39:03.413
Answer me! Where are you?

39:03.417 --> 39:06.250
Please don't blame your dad.

39:07.292 --> 39:09.954
I was just eager to tell you,
I wasn't meant to tell you off.

39:10.625 --> 39:12.490
I care too much about you.

39:12.500 --> 39:16.072
Or, why would I run all the way after you?

39:19.208 --> 39:23.497
Sweetheart, get out please.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.449
Who are you crying your heart out for?

39:31.750 --> 39:33.365
You... you are not under the car?

39:33.750 --> 39:35.286
Thank god...

39:36.708 --> 39:37.367
Ouch...

39:37.667 --> 39:39.123
What is it? Are you ok?

39:39.750 --> 39:40.284
It hurts.

39:40.333 --> 39:42.915
You sure had a rough fall.

39:45.250 --> 39:47.616
Stop messing around! It's dangerous...

39:47.667 --> 39:48.406
I know...

39:48.458 --> 39:49.743
I am worried about you.

39:49.792 --> 39:51.373
- I am fine...
- Does it hurt?

39:51.375 --> 39:52.535
That bad?

39:53.208 --> 39:54.789
Everybody ok? All good?

39:54.958 --> 39:55.993
All good.

39:59.625 --> 40:01.991
Actually it doesn't matter
who wins or who loses.

40:02.042 --> 40:03.042
You two are family.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.240
Yea. You lost! Stop controlling me.

40:05.417 --> 40:06.998
Alright... do whatever you want.

40:07.833 --> 40:09.369
What a mess!

40:10.500 --> 40:13.663
I'll treat this as... a challenge for us.

40:13.750 --> 40:14.910
Was it really a challenge?

40:15.000 --> 40:16.000
This is a challenge.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.744
You'd have to pay for it.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.643
I'll pay for you
if you don't have credit cards with you.

40:20.667 --> 40:22.498
Thanks, Mr. chen. I'll leave my dad to you.

40:22.792 --> 40:23.998
I'll get going now.

40:24.333 --> 40:25.333
Hey!

40:26.250 --> 40:28.411
Bye! Take a cab back please.

40:29.500 --> 40:31.240
You little brat! Hey!

40:33.167 --> 40:37.285
Hey, aren't you her dad? Go! Go after her!

40:44.750 --> 40:45.990
Hey, Bruce...

40:47.750 --> 40:48.535
He's gone.

40:48.625 --> 40:49.956
Come up and get changed!

40:53.208 --> 40:54.914
Ok, you wait for me.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.125
Hurry up then!

40:57.125 --> 40:59.366
Is Mr. chen messing with us?

41:00.250 --> 41:03.322
We are the only ones in the entire
campus reporter program visiting...

41:03.333 --> 41:05.289
Those... rehabilitated offenders?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.198
Excuse me,
we are from tak chi secondary school.

41:09.208 --> 41:10.618
Tak chi secondary school...

41:11.125 --> 41:12.865
- Mr. chen has everything set for you guys.
- Thank you.

41:12.875 --> 41:14.411
You better buy me lunch... buffet lunch.

41:14.417 --> 41:17.580
Mr. guan is waiting inside.

41:17.667 --> 41:19.828
He recently joined our sobriety program.

41:19.833 --> 41:22.165
You guys just go ahead and talk to him.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.083
Take your time.

41:29.208 --> 41:30.994
Morning, Mr. guan.

41:31.125 --> 41:32.125
Good morning...

41:40.083 --> 41:41.789
Did you prepare the questions for today?

41:42.042 --> 41:44.624
Nope... no one asked me to prepare.

41:46.917 --> 41:47.917
I got one.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.412
May I know who is in your family, Mr. guan?

41:51.417 --> 41:52.417
I have two sons.

41:53.167 --> 41:54.967
I have been divorced for
more than ten years.

41:55.042 --> 41:57.704
Was it because of your drinking problem?

41:58.083 --> 41:59.123
I started drinking because

41:59.542 --> 42:01.328
my wife was having an affair.

42:02.375 --> 42:03.581
I drink to get drunk.

42:04.542 --> 42:06.462
When I am drunk,
I don't want to sober myself up.

42:06.708 --> 42:08.434
Who knows I would be drunk
for more than ten years.

42:08.458 --> 42:10.870
More than ten years? How about your sons?

42:11.667 --> 42:12.827
They don't have a care in me.

42:12.917 --> 42:14.202
It's you not caring about them,

42:14.333 --> 42:16.093
or it's them not caring
about you, Mr. guan?

42:17.083 --> 42:18.083
I don't know.

42:18.375 --> 42:20.535
You don't know?
How could you say you are their father?

42:21.583 --> 42:23.369
I know if I do not quit drinking,

42:24.292 --> 42:25.572
I will regret it my entire life.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.536
I have lost so much already.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.956
I don't want to lose my two sons as well.

42:39.875 --> 42:41.675
What would you like to
say to your sons then?

42:46.417 --> 42:47.623
We don't talk.

42:49.625 --> 42:51.305
I don't know how to communicate with them.

42:53.833 --> 42:55.073
Initially, I plan

42:55.708 --> 42:57.039
to wait till they grow up, and

42:57.500 --> 42:59.741
explain to them about
their mother's departure.

43:02.542 --> 43:04.123
The truth is we don't even talk now.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.456
If I have a chance,

43:08.708 --> 43:10.244
I want to tell them

43:12.167 --> 43:13.703
that I really love them

43:15.125 --> 43:16.911
and that I am sorry.

43:20.583 --> 43:22.164
I am sorry, kids.

43:23.292 --> 43:24.623
I really am.

44:07.375 --> 44:08.455
Yes.

44:15.833 --> 44:17.243
Coffee, here you go.

44:23.875 --> 44:26.241
Hey, give this to boss, be smart...

44:32.042 --> 44:32.656
Boss Kane.

44:32.833 --> 44:33.833
Yes!

44:34.250 --> 44:35.250
Coffee.

44:39.333 --> 44:40.539
It doesn't hurt. Again!

44:40.542 --> 44:45.707
You are super, boss!

44:48.292 --> 44:49.292
Yeah!

44:51.167 --> 44:52.167
Next song.

44:52.292 --> 44:53.292
Got it.

44:54.542 --> 44:56.749
Nocturnes by chopin.

45:01.542 --> 45:02.542
Coffee.

45:04.625 --> 45:05.625
Where's yours?

45:05.875 --> 45:07.115
I don't drink coffee.

45:08.708 --> 45:10.059
Getting used to not going to school?

45:10.083 --> 45:11.083
It's ok.

45:11.250 --> 45:12.956
When I was at your age,

45:14.292 --> 45:16.032
I was a total idiot.

45:16.208 --> 45:17.414
How is that possible?

45:17.583 --> 45:19.323
Until I understood one thing

45:20.250 --> 45:21.160
and became who I am now.

45:21.167 --> 45:22.247
Do you know what is it?

45:23.625 --> 45:26.458
The fist - must be ruthless!

45:29.792 --> 45:30.792
Come here.

45:34.292 --> 45:37.364
We hired this MMA champion
for the competition tomorrow night.

45:37.583 --> 45:40.040
I am the broker. Everyone
is betting on him.

45:40.042 --> 45:41.442
I have already collected the money.

45:42.333 --> 45:45.746
I told him to lose the competition.

45:47.167 --> 45:48.373
He said no.

45:50.167 --> 45:52.499
You are smart enough to
know what to do, right?

45:57.125 --> 45:58.240
Take this.

46:00.375 --> 46:02.411
What is it? Does it kill?

46:02.500 --> 46:03.706
Not that easily.

46:03.833 --> 46:06.540
Americans use this in wars.

46:06.625 --> 46:07.705
It's mydocalm.

46:07.875 --> 46:09.476
If he takes this, worst case is that
he will be paralysed for a while.

46:09.500 --> 46:10.990
You won't understand anyway.

46:11.125 --> 46:13.616
Here. Try it on at home, it won't hurt...

46:13.958 --> 46:15.164
When this job's done,

46:16.208 --> 46:17.869
your time will come.

46:38.708 --> 46:39.708
Hello?

46:39.917 --> 46:40.917
Coming.

46:43.625 --> 46:44.976
- Who are you looking for?
- Hello.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.536
I am Jack's class teacher.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.035
Are you his grandma?

46:48.292 --> 46:49.873
Yes. You are?

46:49.958 --> 46:50.572
You can call me Mr. chen.

46:50.667 --> 46:53.204
Mr. chen. Come on in,

46:53.292 --> 46:54.292
take a seat.

46:55.875 --> 46:57.786
- Do you mind sitting on the bed?
- Not at all.

46:57.917 --> 46:58.952
Take a seat...

47:00.000 --> 47:01.160
What are you doing, grandma?

47:02.333 --> 47:03.664
Just a little handicraft,

47:03.917 --> 47:05.282
white orchids...

47:05.417 --> 47:06.247
This is a lot of work.

47:06.333 --> 47:08.073
I know nothing.

47:08.500 --> 47:11.992
Can get a bit of side money
from doing this to make ends meet...

47:13.042 --> 47:15.579
You and Jack have been
living here for a long time.

47:15.792 --> 47:16.531
Oh, yes.

47:16.542 --> 47:19.142
It has been many years,
we have had no luck with public housing...

47:19.500 --> 47:22.242
Jack and his parents were new immigrants.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.582
Then, a traffic accident

47:24.708 --> 47:26.744
took both his parents' lives.

47:27.292 --> 47:30.034
However, Jack is a good kid, and smart too.

47:30.750 --> 47:32.490
You know, look at this,

47:32.708 --> 47:35.700
teachers always have good words for him.

47:35.708 --> 47:36.708
Look,

47:43.625 --> 47:45.741
He hasn't got a lot of friends.

47:45.917 --> 47:47.277
You can see from all these photos,

47:47.500 --> 47:49.240
it's just us two.

47:52.708 --> 47:55.666
He usually goes to work after school.

47:56.042 --> 47:58.203
Does he have a part-time job these days?

47:58.583 --> 48:00.995
He used to work
at a Chinese restaurant every night,

48:01.083 --> 48:03.916
but he started working
at a boxing gym lately.

48:04.750 --> 48:07.366
He doesn't want me to work too hard.

48:08.917 --> 48:11.078
And my health isn't so good.

48:11.500 --> 48:12.990
I am really worried about him.

48:13.125 --> 48:15.912
Oh, right. What brings you here?

48:16.250 --> 48:18.206
Did something happen at school?

48:19.375 --> 48:19.955
Yes...

48:20.292 --> 48:21.327
What is it?

48:25.625 --> 48:27.240
I came here today...

48:28.292 --> 48:32.114
On behalf of the school,
to give you his scholarship.

48:35.208 --> 48:37.324
What a good kid he is!

48:37.875 --> 48:40.116
Thank you, Mr. chen.

48:40.292 --> 48:42.453
Don't thank me. Jack is a great kid.

48:42.875 --> 48:44.740
Yes, he is.

48:44.917 --> 48:47.408
- I am so proud of him.
- Let me help.

48:48.208 --> 48:49.072
That's not what a teacher should do.

48:49.083 --> 48:50.101
I am good at doing this too.

48:50.125 --> 48:50.864
Am I doing it right?

48:51.125 --> 48:52.125
That's right.

49:13.250 --> 49:15.170
You'd better get the champagne
ready for tonight.

49:17.167 --> 49:18.998
Cheers, third round.

49:19.750 --> 49:21.581
Hey, first round.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.248
I'm gonna make you some money.

49:32.625 --> 49:34.286
More power... come on!

49:42.125 --> 49:43.365
How does that feel?

49:44.208 --> 49:45.208
Hi! Champ!

49:50.292 --> 49:52.783
Just playing with you, thank you for that.

49:52.875 --> 49:54.740
Got you right? Good boy.

49:58.875 --> 50:04.996
Hey, what's this?

50:05.917 --> 50:07.202
- Boss Kane!
- Shut up!

50:07.500 --> 50:09.491
What now! Since when you got a say?

50:10.208 --> 50:11.208
Shut up!

50:12.375 --> 50:13.740
Say nothing.

50:17.167 --> 50:19.658
Drink it...

50:23.042 --> 50:23.906
Let me out!

50:23.917 --> 50:24.497
Shut up!

50:24.750 --> 50:26.786
Ladies and gents

50:26.792 --> 50:30.034
let's get ready to rumble.

50:30.250 --> 50:32.161
Let's make easy money.

50:36.458 --> 50:37.789
First round bro., alright?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.199
Gentlemen, sorry for interrupting,

50:47.083 --> 50:52.248
I'm looking for my student,
a young man called Jack.

50:52.250 --> 50:55.322
He is about this height, 16 years old.

50:56.292 --> 50:58.283
Hey man, the locker room is full.

50:58.875 --> 50:59.995
You should not even be here.

51:00.542 --> 51:01.542
If I were you,

51:01.708 --> 51:04.165
I'll turn around and get
the hell out of here.

51:04.625 --> 51:05.625
Look guys,

51:06.667 --> 51:07.907
I don't want any troubles.

51:09.333 --> 51:15.078
I'm just here, looking for my student,
and bring him home.

51:20.458 --> 51:22.198
That's some very expensive shit.

51:22.292 --> 51:24.658
That nearly cost me and my mate
some million bucks tonight.

51:24.750 --> 51:27.822
Mr. chen... I'm here... help... Mr. chen...

51:58.542 --> 51:59.782
You're going home.

52:54.333 --> 52:55.573
Anymore? Come and get some!

53:00.292 --> 53:01.292
Take it easy.

53:17.333 --> 53:18.914
You felt that? Huh?

53:39.917 --> 53:41.373
Like a game, ain't?

53:41.750 --> 53:42.956
First round.

54:23.958 --> 54:26.415
What did I tell you? First round!

54:31.792 --> 54:32.907
Call an ambulance!

54:37.417 --> 54:38.247
He told me to drug him, it wasn't me, sir.

54:38.250 --> 54:38.955
You said it's not you.

54:39.042 --> 54:40.962
- It really wasn't me!
- Then tell me who was it?

54:41.167 --> 54:43.123
It was this little shit and his teacher.

54:47.542 --> 54:48.748
You really are a teacher?

54:49.958 --> 54:50.958
Yes.

54:53.500 --> 54:56.697
This wound looks like...

54:56.792 --> 54:57.827
It's from a bullet?

55:00.500 --> 55:03.287
Didn't know teaching is
so dangerous nowadays.

55:05.708 --> 55:08.450
He made me do it, sir. It really wasn't me!

55:08.542 --> 55:10.407
- He even hosted a bet.
- Sir...

55:10.458 --> 55:11.573
Think before you speak!

55:11.875 --> 55:14.742
Why would I drug him?
I am the biggest victim here.

55:15.000 --> 55:16.893
Just the fixtures in my locker room
costed me hundreds of thousands.

55:16.917 --> 55:17.934
You want to pursue legal actions?

55:17.958 --> 55:20.143
Come with me to the station and
we will do a detailed statement-taking.

55:20.167 --> 55:22.143
Alright. Let's file an investigation and
clear this whole thing up.

55:22.167 --> 55:23.407
No need...

55:23.500 --> 55:25.036
No need, my fault, my fault...

55:25.250 --> 55:27.241
You guys are so busy and
he still has school.

55:27.958 --> 55:28.958
I'll let it slip.

55:29.667 --> 55:30.702
Sir, can we go now, sir?

55:30.792 --> 55:31.792
Alright.

55:32.000 --> 55:34.332
- Bro, give him back his ID.
- Copy that.

55:34.375 --> 55:35.956
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's go.

55:35.958 --> 55:38.074
He really was holding a bet, sir!

55:38.625 --> 55:39.625
You go first.

55:47.292 --> 55:48.372
You are not eighteen yet.

55:48.708 --> 55:51.268
Go back to the station with me,
we will find someone to bail you out.

55:51.292 --> 55:53.408
My grandma is my only family.

55:53.542 --> 55:54.531
I can't let her know about this, sir!

55:54.542 --> 55:56.351
- I don't want her to be worried...
- I will bail him out, sir.

55:56.375 --> 55:57.375
Who are you?

55:58.500 --> 55:59.580
I am his class teacher.

56:02.500 --> 56:03.615
It's okay.

56:15.500 --> 56:16.990
If you want your grandma to be happy,

56:17.458 --> 56:18.493
you should study hard.

56:19.833 --> 56:21.494
It is always the hardest for the elders.

56:25.125 --> 56:26.205
Mr. chen.

56:27.917 --> 56:30.283
Is it too late to mend
what I have done wrong?

56:31.042 --> 56:33.454
School starts at 8, don't be late.

56:34.750 --> 56:35.750
Got it!

56:36.708 --> 56:38.664
By the way, why are you
so great in everything?

56:38.750 --> 56:40.536
I am nothing compared to your granny.

56:40.625 --> 56:41.865
I can't even make that cart go.
Go and help her.

56:41.875 --> 56:42.990
I'm going now.

56:46.958 --> 56:48.243
Let me help you, grandma.

56:48.250 --> 56:49.456
What are you doing here?

56:49.458 --> 56:51.369
What happened to your face?

56:51.583 --> 56:53.164
It's nothing... l tripped.

56:53.250 --> 56:55.992
Why are you so careless?
I'll fix you up later...

57:01.833 --> 57:03.744
A secondary school teacher
barged into the locker room

57:03.750 --> 57:05.741
and fought the MMA champion to a draw!

57:05.958 --> 57:09.450
According to our sources,
the teacher was once a us marine.

57:09.875 --> 57:11.536
Impressive, eh? There's more...

57:11.708 --> 57:14.620
There are reports saying, he is a
graduate from tak chi secondary school.

57:14.875 --> 57:15.705
Who is he?

57:15.792 --> 57:16.577
Isn't he...

57:16.667 --> 57:17.667
Henry chen.

57:18.417 --> 57:21.033
Mr. chen... is it really Mr. chen?

57:21.125 --> 57:23.018
So he was a marine,
that's why he fights so good.

57:23.042 --> 57:24.998
A soldier teaching... that's a first.

57:25.083 --> 57:26.603
He is also a graduate from our school.

57:27.458 --> 57:29.268
I wonder if anyone knows
how he was like when he was a student.

57:29.292 --> 57:30.532
For sure, I remember.

57:30.625 --> 57:32.035
He was a naughty kid.

57:32.167 --> 57:35.327
He was not at school much and if he was he
would get himself into huge troubles.

57:35.417 --> 57:40.411
Look, he was the one who broke the
nose of the principal's statue.

57:40.792 --> 57:41.792
That year,

57:41.875 --> 57:45.493
he singlehandedly ruined
the graduation ceremony.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.039
What are you doing, Henry?

58:07.292 --> 58:09.078
Henry! You again?

58:14.542 --> 58:17.909
Henry! See me in the principal's office!

58:33.417 --> 58:38.537
Ouch... my hand...

58:39.125 --> 58:40.956
Quickly! Get him to the medic!

58:48.708 --> 58:50.039
Mr. chen?

58:50.250 --> 58:52.161
He was one of the naughtiest in the school.

58:52.333 --> 58:54.018
For a period of time,
I didn't see him around anymore.

58:54.042 --> 58:56.283
It turned out that he was expelled.

58:56.792 --> 58:58.202
I'm sorry, Henry

58:58.583 --> 59:00.039
has been expelled by the school.

59:00.125 --> 59:01.976
Forget it, principal.
He is a bad kid, no one can change that.

59:02.000 --> 59:04.582
His mum died young and his father ran away.

59:05.125 --> 59:07.457
As his auntie, I am doing everything I can.

59:07.708 --> 59:09.494
I am even taking him with me to the states.

59:10.458 --> 59:14.952
What are you looking at, tough guy?
You want some?

59:16.958 --> 59:18.289
You're nothing but trouble.

59:20.208 --> 59:24.531
This is a recommendation letter
to the military school for Henry.

59:25.000 --> 59:28.697
I suggest Henry to go study
at a military school in the states.

59:29.042 --> 59:32.409
Only until he learns to obey rules,

59:32.833 --> 59:35.575
he wouldn't be taking the right path.

59:37.708 --> 59:39.369
You should be grateful that
the principal persuaded Kane's parents

59:39.375 --> 59:40.434
not to report to the police.

59:40.458 --> 59:42.790
Else, I would never be
able to bring you to the states.

59:44.458 --> 59:45.458
Let's go.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:02.244
Go be a good boy in the states.

01:00:02.417 --> 01:00:03.873
You can do it.

01:00:06.958 --> 01:00:10.325
I heard he went to study at the military
school the principal recommended

01:00:10.583 --> 01:00:11.823
soldiers...

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.244
Could die at any given moment.

01:00:15.208 --> 01:00:16.323
Why did he quit and

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:17.333
come back to teach?

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:23.990
Someone said,

01:00:25.417 --> 01:00:27.749
war breeds peace

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.244
for the flourishment of
the next generation.

01:00:33.458 --> 01:00:34.493
Yet, all I see

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:38.749
was endless inhuman destruction.

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:43.991
Go...

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:45.373
My daughter is not with me.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.159
Where is she?

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:49.663
She's still in the war zone.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.160
Just go... go... I'll find her.

01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.039
Some people struggle to live,

01:02:16.083 --> 01:02:17.493
but the cruelest thing is

01:02:18.625 --> 01:02:19.785
no matter how hard you try,

01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:23.913
you see countless
of lives sacrificed for nothing.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:29.615
What is the meaning of life?

01:03:04.292 --> 01:03:07.580
I decided to make time for myself and

01:03:08.250 --> 01:03:11.322
to rediscover this world.

01:04:15.042 --> 01:04:16.703
It was a long journey of wandering,

01:04:17.917 --> 01:04:20.124
I travelled back to the east from the west.

01:04:21.208 --> 01:04:24.780
Along the way, I had a feeling that
an eagle was following me around.

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:29.323
I looked at the eagle.

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:33.242
No matter how far or high it goes.

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:40.123
It will always go back to where it
started to breed its next generation.

01:04:41.792 --> 01:04:43.373
I now understand,

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:47.162
the person who wanted me
to depart from where I began,

01:04:47.292 --> 01:04:49.078
was not because he gave up on me,

01:04:50.083 --> 01:04:52.119
he just wished for me to find my own way.

01:05:07.708 --> 01:05:10.666
Have you thought of coming back to teach

01:05:10.792 --> 01:05:13.534
and look after your juniors?

01:05:31.792 --> 01:05:32.497
Good morning.

01:05:32.542 --> 01:05:33.542
Mr. chen.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:35.500
Good morning, principal.

01:05:35.542 --> 01:05:36.542
Morning.

01:05:36.958 --> 01:05:37.697
Mr. chen?

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:38.750
Good morning.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.033
Mr. chen, let's take a selfie.

01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:41.239
Make sure I look good.

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:43.559
If you don't hand in your assignment now,
you are giving me detention.

01:05:43.583 --> 01:05:45.289
- Mr. chen.
- Good morning... Ben sir.

01:05:45.333 --> 01:05:47.745
Didn't know you could fight, Mr. chen.

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:49.198
Breakfast's on me.

01:05:49.333 --> 01:05:51.493
I know what you gonna say,
sure, you can pay for lunch.

01:05:51.875 --> 01:05:52.580
In you go, time for class.

01:05:52.708 --> 01:05:55.028
If you like Mr. chen so much,
you may join him in class 6b.

01:05:56.625 --> 01:05:57.785
Good morning, class.

01:05:57.792 --> 01:05:58.792
Stand up.

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:00.990
Good morning.

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:05.038
It has been a few days we didn't meet,
let's begin with some revision.

01:06:06.333 --> 01:06:08.540
Morning, big brother.

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:10.372
Morning.

01:06:10.542 --> 01:06:11.542
Alright.

01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:13.443
Sit down... and let's begin class.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.331
Who put an apple here?

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:19.122
Pulling pranks on your teacher again?

01:06:19.292 --> 01:06:20.498
- Is it poisoned?
- Mr. chen.

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:23.783
That's from me. Bye!

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:29.411
What? Teachers can't eat apples?

01:06:32.417 --> 01:06:33.122
Anyone knows?

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:36.200
I know... I got it... me...

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.285
62%...

01:06:37.333 --> 01:06:39.870
That's incorrect. Last chance... say it...

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.989
66.50%

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.490
that's correct.

01:06:43.917 --> 01:06:44.656
Next question.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:45.792
Mr chen.

01:06:45.958 --> 01:06:46.617
I haven't even asked.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:48.536
No, Mr. chen. I have to pee.

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:51.958
Be quick with it.

01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:56.417
Let's continue.

01:07:07.083 --> 01:07:08.083
Jack.

01:07:08.667 --> 01:07:09.934
The mock examination is
just around the corner.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:10.958
Are you ready for it yet?

01:07:11.375 --> 01:07:14.162
You may come to me anytime
if you have any questions.

01:07:37.958 --> 01:07:39.073
It's always not working.

01:07:44.042 --> 01:07:45.042
Mr. chen.

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:48.574
You hit it too hard.
There's an extra bottle.

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:49.667
For you.

01:07:54.208 --> 01:07:54.867
Thank you.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.413
May I have a copy of your teaching notes?

01:07:58.542 --> 01:07:59.748
I'll treat you dinner.

01:07:59.792 --> 01:08:01.373
My notes are not on past papers.

01:08:01.417 --> 01:08:02.697
I'm not looking for past papers.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.707
Actually, I want to get
to know my students more

01:08:06.042 --> 01:08:09.614
and make the classes more
interesting for them.

01:08:11.208 --> 01:08:12.823
Ok. Then you decide what we are eating.

01:08:13.417 --> 01:08:14.417
Alright.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:33.787
Go home...

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:36.036
Bye.

01:08:36.042 --> 01:08:36.952
Bye, Mr. chen.

01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:39.448
Bye...

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.240
Have you guys ever thought about

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:52.082
what you want to study
if you get into a university?

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:53.618
That will be mechanical
engineering for sure.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:55.585
I want to fix
all the luxurious cars in the world.

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:57.828
For me? Of course, it will be music.

01:08:57.957 --> 01:09:00.118
In order to code my own game,

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:01.823
I am studying computer science.

01:09:01.957 --> 01:09:02.957
Stupid.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:04.243
You are stupid!

01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:05.615
Why aren't you saying anything?

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:07.917
I want to be a teacher.

01:09:08.042 --> 01:09:09.042
What?

01:09:09.832 --> 01:09:11.948
I said I want to be a teacher,
is there a problem?

01:09:11.957 --> 01:09:13.118
You? Save it.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.990
No way! Take a look of yourself!

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:16.657
I am not dreaming as big.

01:09:16.957 --> 01:09:18.638
I want to get into a good business school,

01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:20.518
learn how to do business and
make a lot of money.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:21.872
That ain't easy,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.090
you have to score two
5â™ªâ™ªs minimum in the dse.

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:26.702
Say who?

01:09:27.542 --> 01:09:28.747
You think I am like you guys?

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:29.535
What did you just say?

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:32.124
Mr. li...

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:34.573
I'm sorry, ok? My bad...

01:09:36.292 --> 01:09:38.828
Can I have some smart drugs?

01:09:39.125 --> 01:09:40.125
Smart drugs?

01:09:40.332 --> 01:09:41.243
Ritalin?

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:42.823
Have you got a prescription?

01:09:44.125 --> 01:09:45.125
No.

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:47.785
Don't forget it next time.

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:49.332
Thank you.

01:10:02.458 --> 01:10:04.449
Everybody, examination begins now.

01:10:15.833 --> 01:10:17.698
This is indeed a mock examination.

01:10:18.792 --> 01:10:21.374
Your results are not the focus here.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.494
What's important for you
guys is to keep it up.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:26.375
Mr. chen.

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:28.539
My score should be 49.

01:10:28.583 --> 01:10:29.583
How come I got a 50?

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.913
Jack's actual score is 49.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.160
I gave him one extra Mark.

01:10:34.208 --> 01:10:37.655
On the passage by Mr. yin haiguang...

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:38.750
"The meaning of life"

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:41.374
he didn't choose a, b, c or d.
He added an option e.

01:10:41.583 --> 01:10:42.413
He wrote,

01:10:42.417 --> 01:10:43.953
"grow from making mistakes".

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:47.284
I think his answer deserves
some encouragement.

01:10:48.792 --> 01:10:50.453
Great!

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:51.740
Give me five.

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:53.792
What score you got?

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.615
About the same as you guys.

01:10:55.708 --> 01:10:56.788
That is?

01:10:57.208 --> 01:10:59.073
Yea, why? We are best friends.

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:01.525
- What is it?
- Whatever, forget it.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.625
What's your score?

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:04.118
About the same as you guys...

01:11:20.750 --> 01:11:22.768
If your result is unsatisfactory,
do it better next time.

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:23.952
Starting today,

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.760
I will be giving you
tutorials after school.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000
Alright?

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
Thank you, Mr. chen.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.400
You really are not going to school?

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:57.786
I don't feel well. Call in sick for me.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:03.199
Alright. I'll go now, bye.

01:12:06.042 --> 01:12:07.042
Chris

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:11.250
what?

01:12:11.708 --> 01:12:12.914
What is it?

01:12:12.958 --> 01:12:14.164
Nothing, go to school now.

01:12:15.917 --> 01:12:16.917
Bye.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:07.740
How is he, doctor?

01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:09.911
The patient is out of danger now,

01:13:10.667 --> 01:13:13.579
but he had an overdose
of the psychiatric drug, ritalin.

01:13:19.333 --> 01:13:20.823
Therefore, he is still in a coma.

01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:22.433
We will have to give him some more time.

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.748
There's another case
of attempted student suicide.

01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:29.240
I am sorry, Mr. ma.

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:30.535
Actually, I don't think it is
the best for the board

01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:32.498
to make a decision promptly,

01:13:32.542 --> 01:13:33.976
just because the media
is stretching the truth.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.351
Transferring is not something that
could be done right away.

01:13:36.375 --> 01:13:38.536
Mr. chen didn't intend
for this to happen... hello?

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:44.574
I am confident about the
professional ethics

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.536
of every single one of our teachers.

01:13:46.958 --> 01:13:49.995
I hereby ask the fellow media
to allow some space for our school,

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:51.869
to tackle the incident.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.082
The student suicide rate
is on the rise again,

01:13:54.167 --> 01:13:56.874
the public has pointed the finger
at the Hong Kong education system.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:58.643
Many people are criticizing
the Hong Kong education system,

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:00.907
in fact the education bureau employs
a regular mechanism.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.412
We constantly seek advice from the public.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.476
Relative adjustments are
made after data collection.

01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:07.866
For tak chi secondary school's
student suicide incident,

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:09.317
I believe it is an individual case.

01:14:09.458 --> 01:14:12.245
Initial investigation reveals that

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:14.081
the teaching methods of
the student's teacher

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:15.456
could be related to
the student's suicide attempt.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:18.495
An internal hearing with the teacher
involved will be held,

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.380
in hope of unveiling the
causes of the problem.

01:14:23.375 --> 01:14:24.375
Mr. chen,

01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:25.614
this hearing

01:14:25.625 --> 01:14:29.493
is to reevaluate
your qualifications as a teacher.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:31.476
There has been numerous occasions where you
did not teach according to the curriculum.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.697
Your teaching methods
are in great difference

01:14:34.958 --> 01:14:36.434
with the principles of
education of the bureau.

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:41.077
Recently, the media had a coverage
on your participation in a gang fight.

01:14:41.292 --> 01:14:42.577
As a teacher,

01:14:42.875 --> 01:14:45.366
you failed even to discipline yourself,

01:14:45.583 --> 01:14:46.863
how can you teach your students?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.309
You have only taught for one year

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:50.518
and you already got a student
attempting to commit suicide.

01:14:50.542 --> 01:14:51.582
How will you explain that?

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:55.373
No. I have no explanation for that.

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:58.039
I don't think we should waste time

01:14:58.042 --> 01:15:01.455
discussing whether
I'm a qualified teacher or not.

01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:03.122
There are 19 cases in 2014.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:05.039
33 cases in 2015.

01:15:05.208 --> 01:15:06.208
In 2016,

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:09.124
another 23 cases in the first eight months.

01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:11.309
There are so many students committing
suicide in Hong Kong each year.

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:14.575
Is it the problem of the students,

01:15:14.875 --> 01:15:16.331
the parents or the teachers?

01:15:16.417 --> 01:15:18.078
Or it is our education system?

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.572
Shouldn't we spend time talking about

01:15:22.917 --> 01:15:25.784
how we could prevent something like this
from happening again?

01:15:30.417 --> 01:15:35.992
Take a look at question â™ª3 on page 67, it
is easier to understand than question â™ª2...

01:15:37.167 --> 01:15:38.247
Mr. chen is back...

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:39.580
Mr. chen.

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:42.290
Where are you guys going?
The class isn't over yet.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:48.448
Excuse me...

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:49.667
Mr. chen...

01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:50.750
Where is Mr. chen?

01:15:52.750 --> 01:15:53.750
Where is Mr. chen?

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:55.740
Mr. chen's gone.

01:15:56.292 --> 01:15:57.327
After the incident,

01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:58.653
do you think he could still stay?

01:16:00.875 --> 01:16:05.323
Mr. chen...

01:16:05.542 --> 01:16:09.660
Mr. chen... don't go...

01:16:10.333 --> 01:16:13.496
Mr. chen... come back...

01:16:13.667 --> 01:16:14.782
Get back to class.

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:17.533
Mr. chen... please don't go...

01:16:17.875 --> 01:16:20.036
Don't go...

01:16:20.125 --> 01:16:24.323
Don't go... Mr. chen...

01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.536
Remember, you can do it.

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:38.240
Don't... go after him!

01:16:39.958 --> 01:16:46.454
Mr. chen... don't go...

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.873
He can tame even these punks,

01:16:51.250 --> 01:16:53.286
but still lost his job in the end.

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:55.536
Was that even worth it?

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:59.405
Mr. chen...

01:17:24.250 --> 01:17:27.617
What shall we do to bring Mr. chen back?

01:17:38.417 --> 01:17:39.893
The world is saying Mr.
Chen is a bad teacher

01:17:39.917 --> 01:17:41.908
and that he is not a good influence.

01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:44.393
What you guys need to do is
to prove to the world that,

01:17:44.417 --> 01:17:46.157
Mr. chen is a good teacher.

01:17:46.625 --> 01:17:49.697
Do your best in the dse,
that's the best you could do to repay him.

01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:53.040
We teachers will take care of the rest.

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:54.601
There is no need for you
guys to be worried.

01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:55.956
Just focus on your studies.

01:17:56.958 --> 01:17:58.678
Don't let the others look down on you guys.

01:18:06.833 --> 01:18:07.833
Please don't go...

01:18:08.292 --> 01:18:13.241
Say no more, it won't help. Let's go.

01:18:15.958 --> 01:18:17.994
Parents...

01:18:18.167 --> 01:18:21.455
Please hang on for a moment...
Listen to me.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:23.400
Would you guys listen to me please?

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:28.290
I am not hoping this parent-teacher meeting

01:18:29.292 --> 01:18:30.828
will change your minds,

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.268
but I have the responsibility in

01:18:32.292 --> 01:18:36.331
clearing the name of all the teachers
and students at or went to tak chi.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:38.407
Shut up! Let's go...

01:18:39.125 --> 01:18:40.205
Don't go...

01:18:40.375 --> 01:18:42.143
You are doing bad to our children...
We are dropping out.

01:18:42.167 --> 01:18:43.577
Listen... listen to me...

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:47.411
What is this?

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:51.792
Parents,

01:18:52.042 --> 01:18:55.034
as the principal of tak
chi secondary school,

01:18:56.083 --> 01:18:57.368
I am greatly responsible

01:18:58.458 --> 01:18:59.948
for what is happening now.

01:19:01.333 --> 01:19:02.789
However,

01:19:03.917 --> 01:19:05.518
I am asking you to spend just a little time

01:19:05.542 --> 01:19:08.124
to listen what Ms. liang
has to say about our vision.

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:09.330
If after listening,

01:19:09.458 --> 01:19:12.700
you are still not having
any faith in tak chi,

01:19:15.042 --> 01:19:16.042
I, Patrick lin,

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:19.617
will cease from working
in the education sector.

01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:22.781
You better keep your words.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:25.374
I guess we could trust principal lin...

01:19:25.875 --> 01:19:27.115
Now you can all see

01:19:27.208 --> 01:19:28.368
this chart which shows the principles

01:19:28.375 --> 01:19:30.768
of education of tak chi secondary school
in the coming years,

01:19:30.792 --> 01:19:32.908
with students' virtues and
morality as the core.

01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:35.309
We will be giving them
all-round supervision,

01:19:35.333 --> 01:19:38.166
including their assignment,
attitude and behaviour,

01:19:38.417 --> 01:19:40.417
we will try our best
to provide them with guidance.

01:19:40.667 --> 01:19:42.658
If we teachers are
to give up on these students,

01:19:42.708 --> 01:19:44.601
aren't they more geared
to giving up on themselves.

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:47.458
If we are to educate,
we must have our own beliefs.

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:50.494
All are educable. All can be successful.

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:51.705
This is our school motto.

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.697
If you got any questions about english,
ask me all you need.

01:19:59.708 --> 01:20:01.790
I won't ask you even if I got any.
You are a pe teacher.

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:05.410
I like teaching pe
because I like finishing work on time.

01:20:05.875 --> 01:20:08.582
Today, I like tutoring you guys more.

01:20:08.833 --> 01:20:12.473
As an english literature major, I am confident
that I can help you guys get through the dse.

01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:24.809
This is grammatically wrong.

01:20:24.833 --> 01:20:26.118
That is "the" question.

01:20:26.167 --> 01:20:26.952
It's not "a". Scratch that.

01:20:26.958 --> 01:20:27.958
Excuse me...

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.285
Alright, together.

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:31.081
To be or not to be.

01:20:31.167 --> 01:20:32.452
That is the question.

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.992
To be or not to be. That is the question.

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:38.241
Brevity is the soul of wit.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.162
Brevity is the soul of wit.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.322
If the students at tak chi
get breakthrough results in the dse,

01:21:08.417 --> 01:21:10.248
the school is likely to gain more attention

01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:12.741
and to save itself from the danger
of being shut down.

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:13.958
You heard that?

01:21:14.042 --> 01:21:16.328
We cannot delay the project anymore.

01:21:17.792 --> 01:21:18.792
Boss... are you ok?

01:21:20.917 --> 01:21:22.623
Relax. I will handle this.

01:21:22.625 --> 01:21:24.240
I'll be watching then.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:29.240
I would deal with tak chi
even if you don't ask.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000
Big wei.

01:21:33.375 --> 01:21:35.457
Get Henry chen's number for me.

01:22:03.208 --> 01:22:03.913
You are back?

01:22:04.125 --> 01:22:05.125
Have you seen Mr. chen?

01:22:05.292 --> 01:22:06.292
He said one o'clock.

01:22:07.542 --> 01:22:08.372
Where is he...

01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:09.330
Nope.

01:22:09.375 --> 01:22:10.740
There's no one on campus.

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:12.268
Don't know where has chen gone?

01:22:12.292 --> 01:22:13.292
Where are the others?

01:22:13.417 --> 01:22:14.417
In the classroom.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.240
He is not downstairs either.

01:22:16.708 --> 01:22:17.988
Let's wait inside the classroom.

01:22:19.833 --> 01:22:20.934
How is it? Have you found him?

01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:22.243
No. We've looked everywhere.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.122
What can we do now?
The examination is starting soon.

01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:27.202
How about we head over
to take the examination first?

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.118
L... I'm afraid we won't make it.

01:22:28.167 --> 01:22:29.434
Right... we are going to miss it.

01:22:29.458 --> 01:22:30.573
Let's get going.

01:22:30.833 --> 01:22:31.833
Let's wait for a while.

01:22:31.958 --> 01:22:33.448
Yes, Mr. chen is always on time.

01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.580
We'll message him again.

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:35.903
Five minutes, that's the maximum.

01:22:58.083 --> 01:23:00.119
You have all got my message, right?

01:23:00.167 --> 01:23:01.407
Students.

01:23:01.458 --> 01:23:04.996
No examination for you guys today! Happy?

01:23:08.708 --> 01:23:09.868
What are you looking at?

01:23:10.417 --> 01:23:12.078
Hey. Don't smoke on school premises.

01:23:12.792 --> 01:23:13.827
Go! Be quick!

01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:17.193
Go! Go! Go! Are you taking a walk?

01:23:17.250 --> 01:23:18.250
Hand over your phones...

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.115
- Give it to me...
- Be careful!

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:35.077
Hey! What do you want?

01:23:35.792 --> 01:23:37.432
It's time for us to take our examination.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.101
Hey. If you don't let us out,
we will call the police.

01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:40.784
Call the police?

01:23:41.042 --> 01:23:41.827
With what?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.911
Then what do you say we do, bro.?

01:23:43.958 --> 01:23:44.998
Wait. Do we have a choice?

01:23:45.083 --> 01:23:46.414
Wait? Till when?

01:23:46.458 --> 01:23:47.618
We will miss the examination.

01:23:47.875 --> 01:23:48.955
I'll go fight them.

01:23:50.792 --> 01:23:51.792
Are you serious?

01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:53.083
Just joking.

01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:08.408
No smoking on school premises.

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:10.417
Bro...

01:24:11.292 --> 01:24:12.327
It's Mr. chen!

01:24:25.333 --> 01:24:26.948
Yeah... Mr. chen...

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:28.250
Is everybody ok?

01:24:28.333 --> 01:24:29.197
Yeah.

01:24:29.292 --> 01:24:30.292
Be careful!

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.518
Now I'm going to teach you the last lesson.

01:24:33.542 --> 01:24:34.542
Self-defense.

01:24:39.583 --> 01:24:40.583
Go ahead!

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.536
Wow! Cool!

01:25:04.917 --> 01:25:05.934
Are you guys not taking the exam?

01:25:05.958 --> 01:25:07.038
Go now!

01:25:07.417 --> 01:25:08.702
Go...

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.000
Stop!

01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:25.208
Jack!

01:25:25.333 --> 01:25:26.333
Your admission form!

01:25:46.125 --> 01:25:47.125
Go to hell!

01:25:47.583 --> 01:25:48.618
Take this!

01:25:49.542 --> 01:25:50.542
Go to hell!

01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:59.250
Are you done?

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:02.956
Come on, break my other hand too.

01:26:03.208 --> 01:26:04.888
It won't be the first time you do it here.

01:26:05.333 --> 01:26:06.664
What is it? Don't you know me?

01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:13.162
Ouch... my hand...

01:26:13.167 --> 01:26:17.115
The taekwando first runner-up
for the year is Kane luo.

01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:20.037
The taekwando champion
for the year is Henry chen.

01:26:20.292 --> 01:26:21.907
Henry chen?

01:26:22.708 --> 01:26:27.452
Apart from his taekwando
first runner-up, Kane

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:30.822
is also the piano contest champion.

01:26:45.083 --> 01:26:47.763
I told you to spend less time on the piano
and practise boxing more.

01:26:47.917 --> 01:26:48.997
You are a shame.

01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:56.082
What are you looking at?
Look at your hands.

01:26:56.250 --> 01:26:57.650
Do you think you can still compete?

01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:58.830
Move!

01:27:01.875 --> 01:27:02.875
Kane?

01:27:04.042 --> 01:27:06.875
You don't call the shots
at tak chi secondary school.

01:28:13.125 --> 01:28:15.161
You ruined my dream.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:17.583
Now...

01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:20.161
I will ruin yours.

01:29:23.208 --> 01:29:24.573
You like teaching, don't you?

01:29:25.542 --> 01:29:26.577
Now let me teach you.

01:29:26.625 --> 01:29:28.143
In this world, money is everything, and

01:29:28.167 --> 01:29:30.167
it's all about power.
No one plays nice in reality.

01:30:51.667 --> 01:30:53.498
Actually, I have been looking for you.

01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:57.494
I know I owe you an apology.

01:31:00.667 --> 01:31:01.952
I am sorry.

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:25.412
I really like playing piano...

01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:07.239
Listening and integrated
skills examination begins now.

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:09.832
The following track is yin haiguang's

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.331
"the meaning of life."

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.240
Hu shi once said,

01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.414
"without dreams,

01:32:16.042 --> 01:32:18.033
is it not an ample life."

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:20.494
Now, you all have aspirations,

01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:23.932
yet, it could all change once
you have stepped into the real world.

01:32:23.958 --> 01:32:25.914
You will then go your own ways,

01:32:25.917 --> 01:32:28.704
reality will strike you
in all different aspects.

01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.912
All these will cause you
to hide away your sublime dreams.

01:32:32.792 --> 01:32:35.579
It is how reality challenges our morals,

01:32:36.208 --> 01:32:37.323
our idealities,

01:32:37.917 --> 01:32:42.707
the sincerity of our pursuit
for the truth, good and beauty.

01:32:43.417 --> 01:32:45.874
It's all the same around the globe.

01:32:46.667 --> 01:32:48.407
Whether we will make it through or not

01:32:48.917 --> 01:32:50.282
depends on this exact moment.

01:32:50.625 --> 01:32:53.241
It's time for our challenge now.

01:33:13.375 --> 01:33:14.490
Grandma...

01:33:15.125 --> 01:33:16.240
Grandma...

01:33:20.542 --> 01:33:22.874
What's the rush?

01:33:24.667 --> 01:33:25.747
What?

01:33:27.958 --> 01:33:29.573
We are getting our own place?

01:33:30.792 --> 01:33:31.656
Really?

01:33:31.708 --> 01:33:32.743
This is great...

01:33:33.667 --> 01:33:35.453
We are finally moving!

01:33:36.792 --> 01:33:37.451
It's him! Freeze!

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:38.540
I have a question for you.

01:33:38.833 --> 01:33:40.243
I know nothing, sir.

01:33:40.708 --> 01:33:43.495
Tell me when will your new song be
available on your channel?

01:33:43.625 --> 01:33:45.286
The whole station likes your singing.

01:33:45.333 --> 01:33:45.992
Really? Thank you, sir.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:46.910
I will go to do the recording now.

01:33:46.958 --> 01:33:48.368
- Good... go ahead!
- Thank you!

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:49.625
What is this?

01:33:50.250 --> 01:33:51.250
It's yours.

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:58.750
What are you looking at?

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:00.875
We will go hand
in the application after breakfast.

01:34:00.958 --> 01:34:02.198
This is your car.

01:34:02.583 --> 01:34:04.583
You are only driving it
after getting your license.

01:34:05.292 --> 01:34:06.292
Thanks, dad.

01:34:06.875 --> 01:34:08.365
Oh no... stop it...

01:34:08.417 --> 01:34:09.998
You are making my face so messy.

01:34:18.250 --> 01:34:19.365
Chris.

01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:21.476
You are having your
university interview later.

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.240
I have to work and can't be there with you.

01:34:24.125 --> 01:34:26.491
Don't go on an empty stomach.
You can do it.

01:34:27.250 --> 01:34:28.490
Dad, I promise you,

01:34:28.708 --> 01:34:30.468
next year, I will get
into a university too.

01:34:30.833 --> 01:34:31.993
Of course you will.

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:34.708
Chief huang.

01:34:34.875 --> 01:34:36.395
Principal, have you been waiting long?

01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:37.285
Not at all...

01:34:37.417 --> 01:34:40.489
Are they keeping the funding to our school

01:34:40.625 --> 01:34:41.985
the same for the next school year?

01:34:42.792 --> 01:34:43.952
I am sorry to inform you that

01:34:44.542 --> 01:34:47.124
the education bureau has
rejected your application.

01:34:48.250 --> 01:34:52.949
Is there something we could do
to change the bureau's decision on...

01:34:54.625 --> 01:34:55.740
The education bureau is taking

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.911
tak chi secondary school's case
at its discretion.

01:34:58.167 --> 01:35:00.954
You guys will have an additonal
20 percent of funding next year,

01:35:01.208 --> 01:35:02.208
okay?

01:35:02.250 --> 01:35:03.250
Also,

01:35:03.417 --> 01:35:06.284
fix your air-conditioning and restrooms.

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:07.831
It gets me sweating every time.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:08.614
Do it quick.

01:35:08.625 --> 01:35:10.365
School will start in September, can do?

01:35:10.667 --> 01:35:12.453
Understood. I will!

01:35:12.958 --> 01:35:13.958
Yes!

01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:47.243
Good morning, class.

01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:50.324
Ms. liang, mock papers again?

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:51.375
We already have those.

01:35:51.417 --> 01:35:52.452
No.

01:35:52.667 --> 01:35:55.374
These are the application forms
for extracurricular activities.

01:35:56.375 --> 01:35:59.867
Besides examinations, I am hoping you guys

01:35:59.958 --> 01:36:02.449
could identify your
interests in other areas,

01:36:02.667 --> 01:36:04.953
and take part in
some extracurricular activities, ok?

01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:06.750
Morning, Ben sir.

01:36:07.042 --> 01:36:10.000
What did you just call me? Starting
today, I am the Dean of discipline.

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:12.059
If you guys don't behave well this year,

01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:13.443
I will go on and on with you guys.

01:36:13.542 --> 01:36:15.783
Giving tutorials at
school from dusk to dawn.

01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:18.081
Here's an advice from me,

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:21.413
since all the air-conditioning
at the school has been fixed,

01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:24.950
you are reminded to put on enough clothes
or bring along a jacket to school.

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.865
Stay warm and don't catch cold, ok?

01:36:45.333 --> 01:36:46.333
Everybody.

01:36:46.542 --> 01:36:47.998
Welcome to my class.
