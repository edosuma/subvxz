00:01.133 --> 00:02.468
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:02.469 --> 00:04.670
Mooney: <i> Killing falcone</i>
<i>would only create chaos.</i>

00:04.672 --> 00:06.005
<i>I need to siphon his strength.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:07.939
<i>So, when the time is right,</i>

00:07.942 --> 00:09.408
<i>Taking over his organization</i>

00:09.410 --> 00:11.276
Will be like
slipping on a glove.

00:11.278 --> 00:13.812
I'm so angry all the time.

00:13.814 --> 00:15.481
Will that ever go away?

00:15.483 --> 00:17.583
Alfred, can you teach me
how to fight?

00:18.685 --> 00:19.852
You've been
through a lot.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.320
I'm scared, jim.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.454
Everywhere I go,

00:22.456 --> 00:24.656
<i>I can feel that monster, zsasz.</i>

00:24.658 --> 00:27.126
Alvarez: <i> Gordon,</i>
<i>some unis brought in a perp.</i>

00:27.128 --> 00:28.627
<i>Claims to know you.</i>

00:28.629 --> 00:29.928
Hey, detective.

00:31.598 --> 00:32.865
Miss me?

00:37.470 --> 00:39.538
Barbara?

00:42.208 --> 00:43.409
Whoa.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.244
Sweet crib.

00:46.579 --> 00:48.614
You must be one rich cop.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.482
It's my girlfriend's place.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.750
Where is she?

00:51.752 --> 00:53.886
I don't know.
Barbara?

00:57.757 --> 00:59.491
So... What?

00:59.493 --> 01:00.826
I get to stay here alone?

01:02.829 --> 01:05.664
I'm hungry.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.599
Barbara:
<i>Dear jim,</i>

01:07.601 --> 01:10.369
<i>I thought I could be strong
and brave for you, but I can't.</i>

01:10.371 --> 01:14.173
<i>Every place I go,
I see falcone and zsasz.</i>

01:14.175 --> 01:16.508
<i>I'm nervous and needy
and screwed up,</i>

01:16.510 --> 01:18.577
<i>And I know that's not
what you need or want,</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:20.846
<i>So I'm going away for a while,
to get myself together.</i>

01:20.848 --> 01:22.948
(cell phone ringing)

01:26.719 --> 01:28.587
This is gordon.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.289
Uh... Uh, right.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.423
Yeah.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.792
We're in the penthouse.
Come on up.

01:39.299 --> 01:42.734
Sounds like your girlfriend's
not coming back, huh?

01:42.736 --> 01:44.636
Why's she worried
about falcone?

01:44.638 --> 01:46.205
None of your business.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.906
So what happens now?

01:47.908 --> 01:49.708
You gonna get the charges
against me dropped?

01:49.710 --> 01:52.711
I will, but you're my only
witness to the wayne murders.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.880
You gonna cuff me
to a drainpipe again?

01:54.882 --> 01:56.782
No, I'm not gonna hold you
against your will.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.584
GCPD, juvie...
you'd just break out.

01:58.586 --> 02:00.552
So I do get to stay here.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.554
No, I have someplace
else in mind.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.223
(knocking on door)

02:04.225 --> 02:06.291
That's the sketch artist.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.327
I need you to describe
the man who shot the waynes.

02:08.329 --> 02:11.597
Wait, where am I going to stay?

02:11.599 --> 02:13.065
Wayne manor.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.642
Do not speak
to the inmate.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.245
Do not touch the inmate unless
in the service of your job.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.914
Do not accept anything from the
inmate under any circumstances.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.716
Who is this guy,
anyway?

02:30.718 --> 02:33.018
<i>Name's ian hargrove,
some genius bomb maker.</i>

02:33.020 --> 02:35.487
<i>Took out over a dozen buildings
in and around gotham.</i>

02:35.489 --> 02:37.523
<i>He's the one that blew up
the commissary last month?</i>

02:37.525 --> 02:39.291
Yeah, and he did it
with match shavings

02:39.293 --> 02:40.459
And apple cider vinegar.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.361
So no mistakes today, got it?

02:44.000 --> 02:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:59.946 --> 03:01.013
Put your hands up.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.455
(latch slides, clicks)

03:16.596 --> 03:19.932
She said this is the man
who killed your parents.

03:19.934 --> 03:22.100
She said she saw his face.

03:22.102 --> 03:24.570
Do you recognize him,
bruce?

03:24.572 --> 03:27.005
No.

03:29.442 --> 03:30.709
What's her name?

03:30.711 --> 03:32.144
Selina kyle.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.812
Do you believe her?

03:33.814 --> 03:35.047
Yes, I do.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.382
So, she saw...

03:37.384 --> 03:39.051
Everything?

03:40.787 --> 03:44.723
And you want her to live here
with us, do you?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.191
A common street criminal.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.492
She's hardly older than bruce.

03:47.494 --> 03:50.362
She's just a kid
who's seen too much.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.030
This is for her safety.

03:52.032 --> 03:53.832
GCPD is full of moles...

03:53.834 --> 03:56.235
Right, and how long would you
have us put her up, then?

03:56.237 --> 03:57.636
I don't know.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.805
No.
The answer is no.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.207
Her being here will put
master bruce in great danger.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.909
Alfred.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.812
She is the witness
to a murder, master bruce.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.046
You do understand that,
don't you?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.615
She's also
the best chance we have

04:09.617 --> 04:10.849
Of finding
who killed my parents.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.318
Isn't she?

04:13.320 --> 04:14.320
Yes, she is.

04:15.855 --> 04:16.954
Then she can stay.

04:18.690 --> 04:20.259
As long as it takes.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.164
I've made my decision.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.568
Yes, master bruce.

04:32.205 --> 04:35.340
Look, I know this is a lot.

04:35.342 --> 04:37.342
But I'm doing
everything I can.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.011
Montoya and allen
and I are meeting

04:39.013 --> 04:40.979
With an ada they trust
this afternoon.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.948
Oh...

04:42.950 --> 04:44.783
A trustworthy lawyer.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.785
In gotham.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.788
Look, if we find this guy,
we'll need her.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.989
She'll have to testify.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.190
Go before a judge.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.392
It won't be easy.

04:53.394 --> 04:56.361
Witnesses back
out all the time.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.963
The ones that stick it out do so

04:57.965 --> 04:59.431
Because they care
about the victims.

04:59.433 --> 05:03.201
We'll do our best to be nice
to her, then, won't we?

05:14.781 --> 05:16.848
It's from the chinese
ming dynasty.

05:19.218 --> 05:21.053
Five...

05:23.489 --> 05:25.991
500 years old.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.494
You can get one just like it
for five bucks, in chinatown.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.073
I'm bruce wayne.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.944
Selina kyle.

05:47.513 --> 05:49.915
People call me cat.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.150
Nice to meet you, cat.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.830
What are you doing?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.765
Nothing.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.767
What's in your hand?

06:08.769 --> 06:10.836
I said, what's in...

06:21.981 --> 06:23.148
What the hell...?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.351
(tires screeching,
horn honking)

06:50.243 --> 06:51.643
Hargrove!

06:53.579 --> 06:56.648
Ian hargrove, time to go.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.293
Man:
<i>Kid, you screwed up, big-time.</i>

07:08.295 --> 07:11.163
But you're still young,
you deserve a second chance.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.564
So I have a
bet for you.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.934
You call heads
or tails.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.136
You lose, you go to jail.

07:19.071 --> 07:20.572
You win, we let you go.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.207
Bet.
Hold on.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.975
There's a catch.

07:25.311 --> 07:27.112
You have to make a promise
to god right now.

07:27.114 --> 07:29.815
If you win, you're gonna
take this as a sign from him

07:29.817 --> 07:31.817
Telling you that you need
to go back to school

07:31.819 --> 07:32.884
And get your
life straight.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.219
Can you promise that?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.754
Do you promise that?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.522
Yes, sir.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.426
Okay then.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.497
Call.
Heads.

07:49.001 --> 07:50.502
Walk away, kid.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.705
Somebody up there loves you.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.574
Hey, harvey.

07:57.376 --> 07:59.244
Go.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.278
Remember your promise.

08:01.881 --> 08:03.281
Jim gordon, GCPD.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.950
I hear good things
about you, counselor.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.219
Harvey dent, likewise
about you, detective.

08:07.221 --> 08:09.120
That was some trick
with the coin.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.455
What if the kid guesses wrong?

08:10.457 --> 08:11.990
You gonna send him to jail?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.825
Teenagers, they nearly
always call heads.

08:13.827 --> 08:14.993
I don't know why.

08:16.295 --> 08:19.030
Two-headed coin.

08:19.032 --> 08:20.832
Whatever works, right?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.734
Dent:
<i>So who is he, jim?</i>

08:22.736 --> 08:24.769
Who really killed the waynes?

08:24.771 --> 08:27.873
This is what we have.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.441
No I.D.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.009
But this is from an eyewitness?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.409
That you have in safe custody.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.981
It's not nearly enough
to go to the law with.

08:35.982 --> 08:37.381
Even if we had I.D. On this guy,

08:37.384 --> 08:38.984
It's the people who hired him
we really want.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.318
I agree.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.787
Your eyewitness is useless
in a courtroom.

08:42.789 --> 08:44.623
But the idea
of your witness

08:44.625 --> 08:46.525
Could be immensely valuable.

08:48.494 --> 08:50.962
Ever hear the name
dick lovecraft?

08:50.964 --> 08:52.831
Sure. Billionaire.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.766
Property, construction,
chemicals.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.967
And as corrupt
as they come.

08:55.969 --> 09:00.272
Falcone, maroni,
even wayne enterprises,

09:00.274 --> 09:02.474
Lovecraft has dealings
with all of them.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.209
Since the waynes' deaths,
he's doubled his fortune.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.111
Including a huge piece
of the arkham deal.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.280
Dent: Lovecraft had a long
feud with thomas wayne

09:08.282 --> 09:10.115
Over deals
and politics.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.150
They couldn't have had a more
different vision for gotham.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.019
I'm willing to bet my career...

09:14.021 --> 09:15.487
On his involvement
in the wayne murders.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.621
That's a big bet.

09:16.623 --> 09:17.656
I want to use your witness

09:17.658 --> 09:19.391
To go after lovecraft.

09:19.393 --> 09:22.427
How? My witness can't connect
lovecraft to the perp.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.530
Lovecraft doesn't know that.

09:25.532 --> 09:27.299
I'll let it leak out

09:27.301 --> 09:29.067
That we have a
secret eyewitness

09:29.069 --> 09:31.202
Who's going to blow
the case wide open

09:31.204 --> 09:33.071
And connect lovecraft
to the wayne killings.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.739
Lovecraft will get very nervous.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.975
And the people around
him will get nervous.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.377
And that's when people start
talking; you know how that goes.

09:39.379 --> 09:41.546
Unless lovecraft wasn't involved
in the wayne murders.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.181
If so, which I doubt,
we still win.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.716
Whoever was involved
in the wayne killings

09:44.718 --> 09:46.484
Will get their
cage rattled

09:46.486 --> 09:47.485
Like the dickens, won't they?

09:47.487 --> 09:48.520
I bet he makes a move.

09:48.522 --> 09:50.422
You like to bet a lot.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.691
Well, what do we got to lose?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.225
My witness becomes a target.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.227
No.

09:55.228 --> 09:56.261
That's the beauty of it.

09:56.263 --> 09:57.362
We never actually file papers.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.531
We never name names.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.666
It's just a
powerful story.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.134
Your witness is perfectly safe.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.502
And you're on board with this?

10:04.504 --> 10:05.737
We've been on board, jim.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.272
Harvey's one of us.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.274
I want what you want, jim.

10:10.643 --> 10:12.744
I want to make this city
a better place.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.350
No names.

10:18.352 --> 10:21.519
Not mine, not my witness,
nothing... just a story.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.289
Just a story.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.491
All right.

10:26.493 --> 10:27.759
Let's try something.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.200
Hey, I thought I was gonna have
to work this case without you.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.401
Where the hell have you been?

10:36.403 --> 10:37.802
You know what?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.471
On second thought, never mind,
I don't want to know.

10:39.473 --> 10:40.705
What do we got?

10:40.707 --> 10:42.507
A biggie.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.409
Blackgate prisoner escaped
while in transit to st. Mark's

10:44.411 --> 10:45.710
For psychiatric care.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.346
His name's ian hargrove,
clinically insane,

10:48.348 --> 10:50.515
With a compulsion for
blowing things up.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.451
He exploded a bunch of
old buildings around gotham.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.654
Last one,
two janitors were killed.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.355
Says here he was busted out
by four gunmen?

10:57.357 --> 11:00.392
Yeah, which is odd...
hargrove never used accomplices.

11:00.394 --> 11:03.161
All right, so who did hargrove
spend time with at blackgate?

11:03.163 --> 11:05.230
Who did he communicate with
on the outside?

11:05.232 --> 11:08.566
His entire stretch,
he was isolated from gen pop.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.335
Never made
or received phone calls.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.137
Only one visitor
in those two years...

11:12.139 --> 11:13.139
His brother john.

11:13.140 --> 11:15.807
Got an address?
We do.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.742
Unis are bringing him
in right now for questioning.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.245
We're lucky you deigned
to show up.

11:20.247 --> 11:21.646
Yeah, sorry.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.182
No problem.

11:25.551 --> 11:26.818
Girl trouble?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.453
Yeah.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.088
I told you.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.291
Those high society dames...
get you all twisted.

11:36.429 --> 11:37.462
Keep your guard up.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.496
Knock lumps out of ya.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.798
Watch your feet.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.266
Right...
Jab, jab, right.

11:41.268 --> 11:42.500
(grunting)

11:42.502 --> 11:43.502
Lead with the...
Hey!

11:43.503 --> 11:44.736
Jab, jab, right.
Jab, jab, right.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.037
(grunting)
jab, jab, right.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.372
Keep that guard up...
jab, jab, right.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.841
Lead...
Jab, jab, right.

11:49.843 --> 11:50.975
Jab, jab, right.

11:50.977 --> 11:52.744
Now keep that...

11:53.713 --> 11:55.113
(grunts fiercely)
yes.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.115
(laughing)
oi!

11:56.116 --> 11:57.348
Sorry, alfred.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.483
Hello.
Bruce.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.554
That hurt.

12:02.556 --> 12:03.755
Yeah, it's supposed to,
isn't it?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.423
Taking a punch is

12:05.425 --> 12:07.559
Just as important
as throwing one, master bruce.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.160
What you doing?

12:09.162 --> 12:10.829
Alfred's teaching
me to fight.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.030
Why?

12:12.032 --> 12:14.499
So I'll be prepared if
something bad happens.

12:14.501 --> 12:19.137
Yeah, 'cause you live
in a pretty rough neighborhood.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.739
Not here,
in gotham.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.108
In gotham, people don't fight
with gloves on.

12:26.445 --> 12:27.445
How's your room?

12:27.447 --> 12:28.513
Everything good?

12:30.149 --> 12:31.649
It'll do.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.218
I'm hungry, though.

12:33.220 --> 12:34.419
Right.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.088
Well, breakfast was
served at 8:00, miss,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.357
Which you slept through.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.525
Lunch shall be
served at 12:00.

12:40.527 --> 12:41.893
There's plenty to
eat in the kitchen.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.294
And alfred will be happy
to fix you something.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.496
No, he won't be, will he?

12:44.498 --> 12:45.897
Because it's not
a bloody hotel.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.601
Relax, old man.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.102
I'll figure it out.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.470
Yeah, you can mind
your manners as well,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.205
You cheeky little minx.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.508
Be nice to her, alfred,
she's our guest.

12:56.510 --> 12:59.477
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
master bruce.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.312
Didn't realize you fancied her.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.614
What do you mean?

13:02.616 --> 13:04.249
N-no.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.650
Well, it's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.252
It's only natural, isn't it?

13:07.254 --> 13:08.820
But you watch her.

13:08.822 --> 13:12.023
She's a lairy one.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.958
Right... Left, left, right.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.428
(grunts)
keep your guard up, son.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.430
You know about girls,
do you, alfred?

13:19.432 --> 13:21.232
Fair sight more than you.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.501
And she, mate,

13:23.503 --> 13:25.203
Is trouble...
watch.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.071
Oi! Oi, oi!

13:49.361 --> 13:51.429
Liza, liza...

13:51.431 --> 13:53.565
What are you up to?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.065
(inhales deeply)

14:35.174 --> 14:37.475
(inhaling)

14:43.616 --> 14:44.782
(quiet laugh)

14:44.784 --> 14:46.718
Lilacs.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.748
♪ ♪

15:29.695 --> 15:31.562
I'm telling you, I don't know
anything about his escape.

15:31.564 --> 15:32.597
I haven't talked to him.

15:32.599 --> 15:33.631
Your own baby brother

15:33.633 --> 15:35.733
Busts out of prison,
and doesn't call you,

15:35.735 --> 15:37.535
The only person he's
talked to in two years?

15:37.537 --> 15:39.203
What happened?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.371
You two have a falling out?

15:40.373 --> 15:41.906
No, ian and I are close.

15:41.908 --> 15:43.107
Always have been.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.143
Even after he bombed
those janitors?

15:45.145 --> 15:46.411
That was an accident.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.746
Bullock:
<i>That's what they all say.</i>

15:48.748 --> 15:50.048
John hargrove:
<i>It's the truth.</i>

15:50.050 --> 15:52.283
(timer dings)

15:52.285 --> 15:53.818
My brother's not a killer.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.186
He never was.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.889
He blew up 12 buildings
in gotham.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.892
Yes, munitions factories
and their offices.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.461
<i>Places that made guns
and bullets and missiles.</i>

16:03.463 --> 16:05.730
<i>I know he was wrong,</i>

16:05.732 --> 16:08.599
<i>But ian thought that
what he was doing was good.</i>

16:10.402 --> 16:13.471
<i>He didn't hurt a soul
until the last bombing.</i>

16:13.473 --> 16:15.373
And he felt terrible about it.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.010
He practically handed himself in
to the cops and pleaded guilty.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.048
Ian has had mental problems
ever since he was a kid.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.116
<i>My parents didn't
have the money</i>

16:25.118 --> 16:26.851
<i>To get him the help he needed.</i>

16:26.853 --> 16:29.120
And he sure as hell wasn't
getting it at blackgate.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.424
<i>Look...</i>

16:33.426 --> 16:35.960
My brother's not a bad man.

16:35.962 --> 16:38.463
Then what is he?

16:40.399 --> 16:42.367
He's sick.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.435
<i>There's a difference.</i>

16:48.907 --> 16:50.441
Gordon: <i> Okay...</i>

16:50.443 --> 16:52.877
<i>So who would want
to bust him out?</i>

16:52.879 --> 16:54.312
I don't know.

16:54.314 --> 16:56.047
But my brother
needs help.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.915
You have to find him.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.053
(door opens)

17:04.123 --> 17:05.890
It's done.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.889
I have a delivery
for you.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.893
I'll take that.

17:47.966 --> 17:49.834
Oh.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.836
Who sent this, anyway?

17:51.838 --> 17:52.570
Who cares?

17:52.572 --> 17:53.905
Hmm.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.840
(timer ticking)

17:55.842 --> 17:57.842
Wait a second.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.177
You hear that?

17:59.179 --> 18:01.245
Sounds like ticking.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.582
(timer dings)

18:04.584 --> 18:06.651
(explosion booming,
men screaming)

18:20.699 --> 18:22.700
Good morning.

18:22.702 --> 18:24.769
Uh-huh.

18:26.205 --> 18:28.539
How'd you sleep?
Your house makes noise.

18:28.541 --> 18:29.974
It's old.

18:31.577 --> 18:32.944
You didn't come here with much.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.045
If you want, alfred can
buy you some clothes.

18:34.047 --> 18:37.014
Pass.

18:41.186 --> 18:43.621
Detective gordon told me
you live on the streets.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.890
Yeah.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.291
So?

18:47.293 --> 18:48.926
What's it like?

18:48.928 --> 18:51.362
Not as nice as here.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.131
Do you live alone?

18:53.133 --> 18:56.167
Are you going to ask me
questions all morning?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.138
Aren't you supposed to be
in school or something?

19:00.140 --> 19:02.173
I'm developing
my own curriculum.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.176
It lets me move at my own speed

19:05.178 --> 19:06.978
And focus on academic areas
that interest me.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.980
Why?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.448
You're a billionaire,
what's to learn?

19:10.450 --> 19:11.883
That's a strange attitude.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.290
So, where are your parents?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.261
They alive?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.263
Um...

19:25.265 --> 19:27.231
Sure.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.833
They're around.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.868
Where?

19:30.870 --> 19:32.370
What's that to you?

19:32.372 --> 19:33.404
Nothing, I just thought...

19:33.406 --> 19:35.239
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.509
I'm not an orphan.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.578
I got family all over.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.790
This was bad enough when it
was just a prison escape.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.458
Now we've got five
dead security guards,

19:54.460 --> 19:57.361
And the press is calling
hargrove an urban terrorist.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.363
Did you get anything
from the bombing site?

19:59.365 --> 20:00.932
Bullock: Forensics is still
looking into it,

20:00.934 --> 20:03.000
But the entire office
was destroyed.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.902
Gordon:
Including all security footage.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.204
Yeah.

20:06.206 --> 20:08.306
We do know that hargrove
and his guys made off

20:08.308 --> 20:10.341
With a compound
called hmx.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.809
Gordon:
It's military grade.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.511
Ten times more powerful
than c-4.

20:13.513 --> 20:14.812
Nasty stuff.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.314
Using explosives

20:16.316 --> 20:17.515
To steal explosives.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.683
What's that about?

20:18.685 --> 20:20.618
Trading up?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.886
He must have
another target in mind.

20:21.888 --> 20:22.920
Some place difficult to crack.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.255
You know what I'm gonna say.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.390
So, go, do it.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.459
(cell phone ringing)

20:31.396 --> 20:33.164
This is gordon.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.465
Alfred:
Yes, detective.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.467
It's alfred.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.169
Alfred, is everything all right?

20:38.171 --> 20:39.403
Is selina okay?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.805
Well, she's safe.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.807
But?

20:42.809 --> 20:46.143
But I'm afraid, detective,
this isn't gonna work out.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.146
She's a... A tough nut,
this one.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.848
Well, look, we need her help

20:50.850 --> 20:52.850
If we have any chance
of catching the waynes' killer.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.553
Just hold onto her for now,
and I'll be out to check on her

20:55.555 --> 20:57.088
As soon as I can.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.157
We shall patiently await
your arrival,

21:00.159 --> 21:01.626
Detective.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.064
Everything good?

21:07.066 --> 21:10.067
Right as rain.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.169
You sure you want to go
through with this?

21:12.171 --> 21:15.239
Butch, don't you go getting
scared on me now.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.841
Never, boss.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.142
(door opens)

21:22.014 --> 21:24.015
Oswald, you're back.

21:24.017 --> 21:25.850
(chuckling)

21:25.852 --> 21:28.452
I'm starting to think
you enjoy being hurt.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.021
(chuckles)

21:30.023 --> 21:31.455
I was passing by.

21:31.457 --> 21:32.590
Thought I'd say hello.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.126
Well, you said it.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.560
Now why are you here?

21:38.530 --> 21:40.598
Honestly, I'm just trying
to be friendly.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.435
(inhales deeply)

21:46.405 --> 21:48.205
(sighs with satisfaction)

21:48.207 --> 21:49.540
Lilacs.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.375
Mmm.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.010
You smell good.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.345
You don't.

21:54.347 --> 21:58.549
(laughing)

21:58.551 --> 22:00.284
Snappy as ever.

22:00.286 --> 22:02.820
Oh! (chuckles)

22:02.822 --> 22:05.256
Well, good-bye then.

22:05.258 --> 22:07.258
Sorry you're still
grumpy with me.

22:07.260 --> 22:10.194
But, you know,

22:10.196 --> 22:14.031
Reaching out in friendship
is never wrong.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.939
Man, that dude's creepy.

22:23.875 --> 22:25.876
Forget him.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.945
He's nothing.

22:30.115 --> 22:31.615
Hargrove's contacts
and phone records

22:31.617 --> 22:32.850
From before he went
to blackgate.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.418
Uh-huh. Yeah.

22:35.454 --> 22:36.620
You all right?

22:36.622 --> 22:37.855
Yeah, yeah.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.395
Barbara left.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.530
<i>Left</i> left?

22:46.532 --> 22:47.732
Yeah.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.200
Where'd she go?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.534
I don't know.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.437
It's a ploy.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.207
She wants you to set a date.

22:56.209 --> 22:57.241
It's a standard move.

22:57.243 --> 22:58.309
She'll be back.

22:58.311 --> 22:59.610
Do you play video games?

22:59.612 --> 23:03.247
Ed, don't <i> ever</i>
do that again.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.648
My apologies, detective.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.417
Do either of you
play video games?

23:06.419 --> 23:07.485
I do, I...

23:07.487 --> 23:09.220
(giggles)
I love video games.

23:09.222 --> 23:12.356
I find that each one presents
a new challenge, a puzzle.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.392
It's a lot like detective work
in that way.

23:14.394 --> 23:15.359
Ed.

23:15.361 --> 23:16.660
Oh, sorry.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.562
Uh, I had a chance
to analyze the shrapnel

23:18.564 --> 23:19.630
From the security office.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.731
And I found something.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.766
It's a nameplate.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.567
It was damaged in the bombing,

23:23.569 --> 23:25.269
But you can still
read the information.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.904
It's from an abandoned
metal factory

23:26.906 --> 23:29.673
Here in gotham.

23:30.642 --> 23:32.576
That's really good work, ed.

23:32.578 --> 23:33.578
Thanks.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.079
Thank <i> you,</i> detective.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.314
Let's go check this out.

24:04.543 --> 24:05.876
GCPD!

24:05.878 --> 24:07.411
Freeze!

24:07.413 --> 24:09.513
Don't shoot!

24:09.515 --> 24:11.515
You found the nameplate,
thank god.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.551
Bullock:
Is anyone else here?

24:13.553 --> 24:15.653
No, but they'll be back soon.
Please, you got to help me.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.922
They broke me out of prison,
they kidnapped me, they told me

24:17.924 --> 24:20.658
They'd kill my brother and his
family if I didn't help them.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.726
Who's "they"?
Russians.

24:22.728 --> 24:24.495
One of their names
is-is kasyanov.

24:24.497 --> 24:25.996
They're planning something
against falcone.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.565
Falcone?
Yeah.

24:27.567 --> 24:29.533
It's a, it's a big job, a vault.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.435
That's why they needed me
to build explosives.

24:31.437 --> 24:32.670
(men shouting)

24:32.672 --> 24:33.771
Behind you!

24:33.773 --> 24:35.005
Get down, get down!

24:49.721 --> 24:50.721
(man shouting)

24:55.060 --> 24:56.393
(men shouting)
help me!

25:00.131 --> 25:02.066
(men shouting)

25:25.323 --> 25:27.324
Bruce: If you want
to go somewhere,

25:27.326 --> 25:28.826
We can call you a taxi.

25:31.763 --> 25:32.830
You move quiet.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.732
So do you.

25:37.802 --> 25:39.904
Are you leaving?

25:39.906 --> 25:42.940
Thinking about it.

25:42.942 --> 25:46.477
I'm sorry if talking
about your family upset you.

25:46.479 --> 25:47.912
I wasn't upset.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.014
You seemed kind of upset.

26:01.826 --> 26:04.562
That's your mom, huh?

26:06.131 --> 26:08.065
She looks nice.

26:08.067 --> 26:09.833
She was.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.804
You saw her...

26:13.806 --> 26:16.507
The night she was killed?

26:16.509 --> 26:19.977
Uh-huh.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.779
And you saw me?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.283
What I did?

26:26.285 --> 26:27.751
What I didn't do?

26:27.753 --> 26:29.119
What are you talking about?

26:29.121 --> 26:30.688
What could you have done?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.056
I don't know... something.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.659
You're dreaming, kid.

26:35.661 --> 26:38.028
A gun's a gun.

26:42.701 --> 26:45.102
My mom's in show business.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.805
Oh?

26:47.807 --> 26:50.207
Yeah.

26:50.209 --> 26:53.243
She sings and dances
and does magic tricks.

26:53.245 --> 26:57.281
Gets paid,
like, millions.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.283
But that's just a cover.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.385
Really, she's a secret agent
for the government.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.854
Wow.

27:03.856 --> 27:06.123
Yeah.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.126
She's on a secret mission.

27:09.128 --> 27:13.330
But when she's done,
she's coming back to get me.

27:13.332 --> 27:16.900
That's good.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.639
Yeah.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.375
Did you ever kiss a girl?

27:24.377 --> 27:26.844
No.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.646
Do you want to?

27:28.648 --> 27:30.414
Why-why do you ask?

27:30.416 --> 27:33.017
Just curious.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.057
Time for your studies,
master bruce.

27:42.293 --> 27:44.762
Thank you, alfred.

27:44.764 --> 27:47.498
You're more than welcome
to join, miss kyle.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.834
Right.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.237
I'll see you later.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.506
Do you have any idea
how many angry phone calls

27:55.508 --> 27:57.041
We've been
getting this week?

27:57.043 --> 27:58.442
Got a terrorist
out there.

27:58.444 --> 27:59.444
And that's our fault?

27:59.445 --> 28:01.211
Jim!

28:01.213 --> 28:04.915
No, no, please.

28:06.084 --> 28:07.518
You tell me, detective...

28:07.520 --> 28:08.852
How is this my fault?

28:08.854 --> 28:10.421
Well, for starters,

28:10.423 --> 28:12.322
You have the mentally ill
housed at blackgate,

28:12.324 --> 28:14.324
A prison with
no facilities for them.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.826
So, you send them
out for treatment,

28:15.828 --> 28:17.161
Which was exactly where

28:17.163 --> 28:18.843
Hargrove was headed
when he was broken out.

28:20.999 --> 28:22.966
I want him found.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.068
Yes, sir.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.303
Today.
Yes, sir.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.506
What is wrong with you?

28:31.109 --> 28:33.944
By the way,
hargrove's brother john,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.547
I went ahead and put him and his
family in protective custody.

28:36.549 --> 28:38.082
That'll help.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.416
Yeah, only problem is...

28:39.418 --> 28:41.351
Hargrove doesn't know that.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.955
All right, dent.

28:44.957 --> 28:47.891
You dragged me
down here, now what?

28:51.830 --> 28:54.832
I got the last piece
of the puzzle in place.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.200
I'm bringing charges
against you.

28:56.202 --> 28:58.469
Oh, that old song again?

28:58.471 --> 29:01.105
You will never prove fraud.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.674
You know that, and I know that.

29:03.676 --> 29:05.576
Fraud charges are only
part of it.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.045
Oh, really?
What, then? Jaywalking?

29:08.047 --> 29:10.247
Conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder.

29:10.249 --> 29:11.815
Murder?

29:11.817 --> 29:13.383
So, tell me, dent...

29:13.385 --> 29:14.818
Who did I kill?

29:14.820 --> 29:16.987
Thomas and martha wayne.

29:16.989 --> 29:18.922
(scoffs):
Oh, god...

29:18.924 --> 29:21.358
I have an eyewitness who
can tie you to the crime,

29:21.360 --> 29:23.927
You and all the
others involved.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.929
That's absurd.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.005
Help yourself
out here, dick.

29:37.542 --> 29:39.543
Think about your options.

29:39.545 --> 29:41.411
This is gonna get ugly.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.181
(scoffing laugh)

29:44.183 --> 29:46.750
You're a fool.

29:46.752 --> 29:51.488
And you have no idea who or
what you're even dealing with.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.024
Don't you ever
threaten me!

29:54.026 --> 29:57.060
I will rip you open.

30:11.009 --> 30:13.043
It was good to see you, dick.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.011
Bullock:
<i>Jim!</i>

30:14.013 --> 30:15.345
Got it.

30:15.347 --> 30:16.580
Yeah?

30:16.582 --> 30:18.182
Meet gregor kasyanov.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.416
Long rap sheet.

30:19.418 --> 30:20.884
Worked for nikolai
before he died.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.319
Who does he work for now?

30:22.321 --> 30:23.321
Beats me.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.655
All right.

30:24.657 --> 30:26.657
Hargrove said it's a big
job, right? A vault.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.325
Somebody's got to
be bankrolling it.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.460
Yeah, someone with cash
and pull and beef with falcone.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.129
Problem is... in gotham,

30:32.131 --> 30:34.264
Anyone with cash and pull
has beef with falcone.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.232
Gordon:
Hmm.

30:35.234 --> 30:36.400
So, who is it?

30:51.783 --> 30:54.251
(mooney clicks tongue)

30:54.253 --> 30:56.086
You kept me waiting.

30:56.088 --> 30:58.522
Ran into a little trouble.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.157
Nothing to worry about.

31:00.159 --> 31:02.793
Good, I've got a lot
riding on this job.

31:02.795 --> 31:04.294
You've said.

31:04.296 --> 31:06.597
Mooney:
Your boss nikolai is dead

31:06.599 --> 31:08.599
Because of falcone.

31:08.601 --> 31:09.967
You want to get back at him,

31:09.969 --> 31:13.003
You hit him where it hurts...
his money.

31:13.005 --> 31:14.304
Ain't that right, butch?

31:14.306 --> 31:15.639
Yep.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.407
The root of all evil.

31:17.409 --> 31:19.176
We'll take his money.

31:19.178 --> 31:20.544
No problem.

31:20.546 --> 31:23.113
As long as it's there,
like you said.

31:23.115 --> 31:25.115
Oh, it's there.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.951
I'm positive.

31:27.953 --> 31:29.653
The truck you needed.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.490
And gregor...

31:35.059 --> 31:36.760
...Break a leg.

31:48.806 --> 31:50.874
(water burbling)

31:55.380 --> 31:58.849
(heart beating)

31:58.851 --> 32:01.051
(heartbeat increases)

32:05.223 --> 32:07.224
(selina scoffs)

32:07.226 --> 32:10.727
You're the weirdest
kid I've ever met.

32:14.565 --> 32:17.134
Why are you doing that?

32:17.136 --> 32:19.503
Training.

32:19.505 --> 32:21.138
Oh...

32:21.140 --> 32:23.173
Like the boxing.

32:23.175 --> 32:25.842
So, if anyone mugs you
with a diving board,

32:25.844 --> 32:27.411
You'll be ready, huh?

32:27.413 --> 32:29.146
Yes.

32:29.148 --> 32:31.148
I mean, no.

32:31.150 --> 32:33.317
I'm developing
self-discipline and willpower.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.551
Why?

32:34.553 --> 32:36.620
So I can be strong.

32:36.622 --> 32:39.790
I get you, but it won't work.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.793
Not on the streets,
not in gotham.

32:42.795 --> 32:43.894
Why's that?

32:43.896 --> 32:45.662
Out there on the streets,

32:45.664 --> 32:46.863
It's not enough to be strong.

32:46.865 --> 32:50.167
You gotta be mean.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.502
Gotta be ruthless.

32:54.205 --> 32:55.706
Do you know what ruthless means?

32:55.708 --> 32:57.274
Of course I do.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.809
Yeah?

32:58.811 --> 32:59.943
Well, you ain't.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.112
You're a nice kid.

33:02.114 --> 33:04.748
Five minutes on the street,
you'll be mincemeat.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.317
And holding your breath
won't do a damn thing.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.266
Host: The subject of today's
category is numbers.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.268
Here we go.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.136
How many bones in the human arm?

33:26.138 --> 33:27.138
Thirty-two.

33:27.139 --> 33:28.139
Woman:
Thirty-two.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.140
(bell dings)

33:29.141 --> 33:30.707
Host:
Correct.

33:30.709 --> 33:34.811
Next, how many elements
in the periodic table?

33:34.813 --> 33:36.046
118.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.648
Woman:
Uh... 118.

33:38.650 --> 33:39.883
(bell dings)

33:39.885 --> 33:41.651
Host:
Yes, again.

33:41.653 --> 33:42.886
Now for a tough one.

33:42.888 --> 33:46.089
How many eyes are there
on cards in a deck?

33:46.091 --> 33:47.091
Forty-two.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.358
Woman:
21.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.659
(buzzer sounds)

33:49.661 --> 33:51.328
Host:
No, I'm sorry.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.264
The number you were
looking for is 42.

33:54.266 --> 33:56.099
You forgot to double it
for two eyes.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.801
(lively music playing)

33:59.670 --> 34:01.104
(whoops, laughs)

34:01.106 --> 34:02.706
Host: Well, that concludes
our show for today.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.940
We'd like to thank
all the contestants

34:03.942 --> 34:05.842
That participated here in studio

34:05.844 --> 34:07.644
And those of you
playing along at home.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.646
We'll be back right after this.

34:09.648 --> 34:11.148
Bullock:
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.315
What about the explosives?

34:12.317 --> 34:14.650
It-it's a very
specific type.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.186
It's highly volatile,

34:16.188 --> 34:18.088
And it's very difficult
to manufacture.

34:18.090 --> 34:21.123
It's for one use,
and one use only.

34:21.126 --> 34:22.759
To penetrate iron.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.161
Like a vault
in a bank.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.629
Mm-mm, no, they're all steel.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.264
No one makes anything
out of iron anymore.

34:27.266 --> 34:29.266
Not for...
A hundred years, at least.

34:29.268 --> 34:31.333
The gotham armory.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.601
Yeah.

34:32.603 --> 34:34.004
Yeah, they have
those iron vaults

34:34.005 --> 34:35.472
They used to keep
the gunpowder in.

34:35.474 --> 34:36.873
A few years ago,

34:36.875 --> 34:38.241
A private investment
group bought it.

34:38.243 --> 34:40.043
Ten to one,
falcone's behind it.

34:40.045 --> 34:43.112
Hmm...? Do you...?

34:50.321 --> 34:53.322
How much longer?

34:53.324 --> 34:55.592
It's ready.

35:15.146 --> 35:17.647
It didn't work.

35:22.553 --> 35:24.688
(laughter echoing)

35:27.024 --> 35:28.825
Hey, hey...

35:28.827 --> 35:30.460
Promise me nobody else
is gonna get hurt.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.463
Sure, no problem.

35:32.464 --> 35:33.597
Cross my heart.

35:49.680 --> 35:51.081
You're surrounded!

35:51.083 --> 35:51.915
(sirens approaching)

35:51.917 --> 35:53.083
There's no way out!

35:53.085 --> 35:54.518
(sirens whooping)

35:54.520 --> 35:56.753
Drop your weapons!

35:56.755 --> 35:58.788
Kasyanov:
Don't do it! Get back!

35:59.857 --> 36:01.291
Hargrove!

36:02.260 --> 36:04.327
Ian hargrove!

36:04.329 --> 36:06.163
Your brother
and his family are safe.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.931
We have them in
protective custody.

36:09.667 --> 36:10.700
Kasyanov:
If he runs, shoot him!

36:10.702 --> 36:11.768
Don't shoot!

36:11.770 --> 36:12.903
Man: You shoot him,
they shoot us!

36:12.905 --> 36:14.971
Drop your weapons!

36:21.078 --> 36:24.281
(cell phone ringtone playing)

36:27.018 --> 36:28.485
Get away from the truck!

36:28.487 --> 36:29.487
Everybody down!

37:06.991 --> 37:08.258
Why'd you do that?

37:08.260 --> 37:09.859
Bet you can't hit me.

37:09.861 --> 37:11.661
I could.

37:11.663 --> 37:12.862
But why would I want to?

37:12.864 --> 37:13.997
Try.

37:13.999 --> 37:14.999
What for?

37:15.000 --> 37:18.935
Hit me, and...

37:18.937 --> 37:20.837
Hmm...

37:20.839 --> 37:22.839
I'll let you kiss me.

37:28.813 --> 37:30.714
Ha!

37:36.587 --> 37:38.288
You didn't get me.

37:38.290 --> 37:40.156
Ah, no!

37:46.497 --> 37:48.298
Oh!
(laughing)

37:53.070 --> 37:55.639
(bruce shouting playfully)

37:58.609 --> 38:00.777
(cell phone ringing)

38:04.081 --> 38:05.215
Gordon:
Morning, alfred.

38:05.217 --> 38:06.650
Ah, detective.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.084
I've been trying
to get out there.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.619
I'm sorry, uh...
Is everything okay?

38:09.621 --> 38:10.987
Is she behaving herself?

38:10.989 --> 38:13.323
Well, uh, not really, no.

38:13.325 --> 38:14.524
That's all right.

38:14.526 --> 38:15.825
It is?

38:15.827 --> 38:17.060
Yes, well, she's...

38:17.062 --> 38:20.096
A breath of fresh air,
I might say.

38:20.098 --> 38:22.532
Glad to hear it.

38:22.534 --> 38:24.901
I'll be out there
as-as soon as I can.

38:24.903 --> 38:27.537
Very good, sir.

38:35.880 --> 38:36.946
(surprised gasp)

38:36.948 --> 38:38.948
Oh...

38:38.950 --> 38:40.317
Forgive me for the intrusion,

38:40.319 --> 38:42.052
But it's urgent
that I speak with you.

38:43.788 --> 38:44.954
(laughs)

38:44.956 --> 38:46.356
You know who I am.

38:46.358 --> 38:48.792
Yeah.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.227
And falcone would kill you
if he knew you were here.

38:51.229 --> 38:54.964
Perhaps.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.966
What would he do if I told him

38:56.968 --> 38:59.269
That you were spying
on him for fish mooney?

38:59.271 --> 39:01.538
You don't have any proof.

39:01.540 --> 39:04.107
No.

39:07.278 --> 39:10.413
But suspicion,
it's a funny thing.

39:10.415 --> 39:12.082
Hmm?

39:12.084 --> 39:14.984
Falcone might not choose
to believe me at first,

39:14.986 --> 39:17.087
But every time
he looked at you,

39:17.089 --> 39:21.057
He'd ask himself... is she?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.926
Could she?

39:22.928 --> 39:24.427
Would she?

39:24.429 --> 39:26.062
You're wrong.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.364
He cares about me.

39:27.366 --> 39:30.567
Let's call him and find out,
shall we?

39:32.603 --> 39:35.305
(keypad beeping)

39:36.407 --> 39:37.507
Stop!

39:47.852 --> 39:50.854
Your secret is safe with me.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.957
I won't tell,

39:53.959 --> 39:56.359
Because you...

39:56.361 --> 40:00.864
Are gonna keep working for fish.

40:00.866 --> 40:04.534
And you are not going
to tell anyone.

40:04.536 --> 40:06.603
Or you'll die.

40:09.507 --> 40:11.274
Gordon:
Messages for gordon.

40:11.276 --> 40:13.343
Thanks.

40:13.345 --> 40:15.378
Jim.
You have a minute?

40:15.380 --> 40:17.080
Uh, yeah.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.085
I met with lovecraft.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.119
How'd it go?

40:23.121 --> 40:24.121
He was scared.

40:24.122 --> 40:25.555
He's involved, all right.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.924
Scared isn't proof.
You didn't see him.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.126
Told the same story
in a few other spots.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.294
All the big players
will know by now,

40:31.296 --> 40:32.295
Someone will start talking.

40:32.297 --> 40:33.963
If and when they do,

40:33.965 --> 40:35.665
Neither of us makes a move
without talking first.

40:35.667 --> 40:36.966
We move together on this.

40:36.968 --> 40:38.535
Absolutely.

40:38.537 --> 40:39.937
Hey, nice work
on the hargrove case.

40:39.938 --> 40:41.137
You saved the poor
guy's life.

40:41.139 --> 40:42.672
You're a regular saint.
Thanks.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.140
Uh, we'll be talking
again soon, I hope.

40:44.142 --> 40:45.608
You bet.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.976
Thanks, counselor.

40:48.145 --> 40:49.579
Finish up with hargrove?

40:49.581 --> 40:51.581
Yeah.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.082
He's on his way to arkham.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.284
Arkham?

40:54.286 --> 40:56.152
Mayor's directive.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.054
He's taking all the criminally
insane inmates from blackgate,

40:58.056 --> 40:59.389
Sending them to arkham,

40:59.391 --> 41:01.090
So they can get
appropriate treatment.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.559
That's nuts.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.360
Appropriate tr...
The building's 200 years old.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.162
Welcome to gotham.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.064
Oh, and get this...
hargrove said that the bomb

41:08.066 --> 41:09.566
That blew up the money
wasn't his.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.268
Whose was it?
He didn't know.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.610
How did it go?

41:20.612 --> 41:22.111
Cops were everywhere.

41:22.113 --> 41:24.314
Our guys had
no way out.

41:24.316 --> 41:26.015
I had to make
the call.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.283
Is everybody dead?

41:27.285 --> 41:29.052
Gregor? All his men?

41:29.054 --> 41:30.987
Every last one.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.956
Good.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.958
I can't stand loose strings.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.359
You're not mad?

41:36.361 --> 41:38.228
That's a hell of a lot
of money we just lost.

41:38.230 --> 41:39.529
Mad?

41:39.531 --> 41:41.498
I couldn't be happier.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.733
The point wasn't to steal
that money, butch.

41:43.735 --> 41:45.535
It was to hurt falcone.

41:47.004 --> 41:50.006
Well, that you did, fish.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.407
That you did.

41:51.409 --> 41:52.642
Good afternoon, everyone.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.744
Thank you all for coming.

41:54.746 --> 41:56.980
As you well know,

41:56.982 --> 41:58.381
The people of gotham

41:58.383 --> 42:01.718
<i>Have been shaken
by tragedy in recent days,</i>

42:01.720 --> 42:06.389
<i>Tragedy no citizen
should have to endure.</i>

42:06.391 --> 42:09.592
<i>What has happened these past
few days is a direct result</i>

42:09.594 --> 42:13.162
<i>Of gotham's criminally
insane not getting</i>

42:13.164 --> 42:17.600
<i>The appropriate treatment
and help that we owe them.</i>

42:17.602 --> 42:20.036
<i>That is why I am moving
forward with plans</i>

42:20.038 --> 42:23.940
<i>To turn the recently
renovated arkham asylum</i>

42:23.942 --> 42:25.842
<i>Into a remedial facility...</i>

42:25.844 --> 42:27.410
All right, let's go,
here, man; let's go.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.546
<i>...For the criminally insane.</i>

42:32.583 --> 42:33.650
Gordon:
<i>Barbara...</i>

42:33.652 --> 42:35.451
It's me.

42:35.453 --> 42:38.021
I got your letter, and I, um...

42:38.023 --> 42:42.859
I know you said you needed
some time away from gotham.

42:42.861 --> 42:44.928
From me.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.964
But I want you to come back.

42:47.966 --> 42:52.602
I need you... To come back.

42:52.604 --> 42:55.972
I don't have anything
without you.

42:58.809 --> 43:01.010
And I love you.
