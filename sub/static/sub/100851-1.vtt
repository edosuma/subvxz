00:22.874 --> 00:25.810
On April 2nd,
1988, Elizabeth Anderson

00:25.843 --> 00:27.845
married John Papadopoulos.

00:27.879 --> 00:30.748
Elizabeth was 25 and John was 27

00:30.782 --> 00:33.116
when John asked for her hand in
marriage.

00:33.150 --> 00:35.085
Their relatives traveled
from around the globe

00:35.118 --> 00:36.621
for the happy occasion.

00:36.654 --> 00:39.958
The weather was pristine,
the groom was handsome,

00:39.991 --> 00:43.427
the bride was beautiful,
and Elizabeth's smile

00:43.460 --> 00:45.228
was the centerpiece of it all.

00:45.262 --> 00:47.932
It was my mother's dream
wedding, and it will be

00:47.966 --> 00:49.567
my dream wedding, too.

00:49.601 --> 00:52.070
So everything has to be perfect.

00:53.037 --> 00:55.573
Even my adorable flower girl.

00:55.607 --> 00:56.874
Okay, Sarah?

00:56.908 --> 00:58.241
Okay, Ms. Papadopoulos.

00:59.509 --> 01:02.714
Sweetheart, I'm your big
cousin. Call me Heather.

01:04.015 --> 01:05.883
Now, let's practice your steps.

01:06.718 --> 01:10.387
Step right together, step
left together, step...

01:10.420 --> 01:14.659
Richard, those flowers are
carnations. I need roses.

01:14.692 --> 01:17.394
Ms. Papadopoulos, I
have no more roses left.

01:17.427 --> 01:19.329
The Rodriguez wedding
ordered them all first.

01:19.363 --> 01:22.432
Well, I will pay more for
those roses. Make it happen.

01:22.466 --> 01:25.202
Cheryl, I want napkin rings
covered in hydrangea blossoms

01:25.235 --> 01:26.738
for the table settings.

01:26.771 --> 01:27.805
Good, Sarah.

01:27.839 --> 01:31.042
Now, spread pedals three
times for every two steps.

01:31.075 --> 01:34.244
Theresa, I want waiters in
cutaway collars with slim fit

01:34.277 --> 01:36.380
shirts. This is not
the outfit I requested.

01:36.413 --> 01:39.851
Now, Sarah, sweeping
circles so that the pedals

01:39.884 --> 01:41.052
fall like a rainbow.

01:41.085 --> 01:42.319
Hey, Heather.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.554
Oh.

01:43.588 --> 01:46.991
Paul. Oh, Paul! This is not
one of our usual work events.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.693
This is my wedding.

01:48.726 --> 01:50.995
So, I need you to stop
flirting with the staff

01:51.029 --> 01:52.429
and step it up, okay?

01:52.462 --> 01:54.666
I mean, I can't serve that.
What is it?

01:54.699 --> 01:55.733
It's my lunch.

01:55.767 --> 01:57.635
Why am I even friends with you?

01:57.669 --> 02:00.738
Because you are the only
caterer that I've never fired.

02:00.772 --> 02:01.973
Lots of them quit, too.

02:02.907 --> 02:04.474
What do you want, Paul?

02:04.508 --> 02:07.277
Do you think that hot
florist is out of my league?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.346
Sarah, good work.

02:09.378 --> 02:11.381
I need you to practice
a minimum of two hours

02:11.415 --> 02:13.316
every night until the wedding,
okay?

02:13.350 --> 02:14.451
What are those?

02:16.054 --> 02:17.320
Water balloons.

02:17.354 --> 02:20.457
They're for an April
Fools' joke. Tomorrow.

02:20.490 --> 02:23.293
Oh, April Fools' Day. Right.

02:24.128 --> 02:26.430
Absolutely no pranks, you two.

02:26.463 --> 02:27.999
And seriously, Gary, Guillaume,

02:28.032 --> 02:31.468
simply throwing water balloons
at someone is not a prank.

02:31.501 --> 02:33.071
A prank is meant to trick
someone.

02:33.104 --> 02:36.808
Like, oh, like if like I told
Bryce the wedding was off.

02:36.841 --> 02:39.342
Oh my God, he would
die.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.780
Oh, speaking of which, Bryce,
next tuxedo.

02:42.814 --> 02:44.916
We've already tried eight,
babe.

02:44.949 --> 02:47.652
Then we are eight closer
to finding the perfect one.

02:47.685 --> 02:48.653
Do I really
have to try them on here,

02:48.686 --> 02:50.188
in front of everybody?

02:50.220 --> 02:51.388
Time is money.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.091
Okay, Heather,
everything's all set

02:53.124 --> 02:55.492
for your bachelorette party
tonight. We're taking you...

02:55.525 --> 02:56.493
Wait, hold on.

02:56.526 --> 02:58.361
Pre-bachelorette party selfie.

02:59.564 --> 03:00.565
Becky, cool it
with the selfies already.

03:00.598 --> 03:01.833
Seriously, you're an attorney

03:01.866 --> 03:03.101
for the Department of Justice.

03:03.134 --> 03:04.202
So.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.937
Hey, uh, don't add a
location when you post that.

03:05.970 --> 03:06.771
Why not?

03:06.804 --> 03:07.772
Just don't.

03:07.805 --> 03:10.507
Okay, Jesus. Relax, Gretchen.

03:10.540 --> 03:12.476
Anyway, we're taking you to
Deja Dude...

03:12.509 --> 03:14.746
I hooked up with the
bouncer there last night.

03:14.779 --> 03:17.481
You know, I didn't think
I was into butt stuff,

03:17.514 --> 03:20.118
but... Oh, hold on, it's
the Attorney General.

03:20.151 --> 03:21.518
- Hello...
- Anyway.

03:21.552 --> 03:23.721
And then the limo will pick
us up at, like, six or seven...

03:23.755 --> 03:25.422
Well, which is it? Six or
seven?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.859
I don't know. I forgot?

03:27.892 --> 03:31.095
Who cares? The divorce
rate in America's 50%.

03:31.129 --> 03:33.698
Cindy, I know you're going
through a difficult time

03:33.731 --> 03:36.433
right now because of
your split from Harold,

03:36.466 --> 03:39.704
but I put you in charge because
you are the responsible one.

03:39.737 --> 03:43.074
I mean, what are we gonna do
after this Deja Dude place?

03:43.107 --> 03:44.208
We...

03:45.109 --> 03:46.309
party?

03:46.343 --> 03:48.445
What's it matter?
These memories are gonna be in the toilet

03:48.478 --> 03:49.781
in five years anyway?

03:49.814 --> 03:51.182
Thank you, Cindy.

03:51.215 --> 03:53.050
I went ahead and put
together a little itinerary

03:53.084 --> 03:54.518
for tonight. Here are your time
tables.

03:54.552 --> 03:56.654
Oh, come on. I already
planned everything already.

03:56.687 --> 03:58.823
Yeah, not really.

03:58.856 --> 04:02.193
7:30 dinner reservation at
Chez Ricardo.

04:02.226 --> 04:03.628
That's not in Litchfield County,
right?

04:03.661 --> 04:04.461
I can't go there.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.295
Why not?

04:05.328 --> 04:06.296
I just can't.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.397
What, are you
on the run or something?

04:07.430 --> 04:08.232
What? No!

04:08.266 --> 04:09.267
What?

04:09.299 --> 04:11.135
Come on, Heather. This is
ridiculous.

04:11.169 --> 04:13.436
You've broken your itinerary
into two minute intervals.

04:13.470 --> 04:16.240
9:00 p.m. finish dinner,
9:02 p.m. get the check.

04:16.274 --> 04:17.474
You need to relax.

04:17.507 --> 04:18.743
Yeah, control freak.

04:18.776 --> 04:21.511
Hello? It's not like I
planned a root canal here.

04:21.545 --> 04:23.446
I planned a fun night.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.615
Now, I need to get back to work
because

04:24.649 --> 04:26.751
I am way behind schedule.

04:26.784 --> 04:28.052
Bryce, that tuxedo is awful

04:28.085 --> 04:30.988
and, Becky, don't talk about
butt stuff at my wedding.

04:40.798 --> 04:42.200
Richard? What are you doing?

04:42.233 --> 04:44.802
Oh, I'm walking home.
My van is in the shop.

04:44.836 --> 04:47.437
It's always dying on me. But
it should be ready tomorrow.

04:49.472 --> 04:50.407
Take my car.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.176
Oh, no, Ms. Papadopoulos. I'm
fine.

04:52.210 --> 04:54.078
Return it in the morning, not
a scratch.

04:54.111 --> 04:56.113
No, it's really not a far
walk.

04:56.147 --> 04:58.883
You live 6.3 miles away. Take
it.

05:01.451 --> 05:02.820
And I want my roses.

05:19.502 --> 05:20.771
And whose car is that?

05:20.805 --> 05:22.405
Oh, it's Ms. Papadopoulos'.

05:23.641 --> 05:25.542
By the way, she needs your
roses, Maria.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.744
What?

05:26.777 --> 05:28.478
First she steals your sister's
dress and now she wants to

05:28.511 --> 05:30.081
steal your sister's roses.

05:30.114 --> 05:31.716
That woman is the devil.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.317
She's not the devil, Mama.

05:33.351 --> 05:35.086
No? Then what is she?

05:35.119 --> 05:35.953
She's

05:37.221 --> 05:38.155
complex!

05:45.763 --> 05:47.131
How's it going so far,
sweetheart?

05:47.164 --> 05:48.566
Oh, hey, Daddy.

05:48.599 --> 05:49.399
Hey.

05:49.432 --> 05:50.533
Where to begin?

05:50.568 --> 05:52.670
They didn't deliver enough
napkin rings, the truffles

05:52.703 --> 05:54.572
aren't the ones I ordered,
the wine my winemaker

05:54.605 --> 05:56.173
suggested doesn't pair well with
the fish,

05:56.207 --> 05:58.242
Bryce's cousin has some
sort of family emergency

05:58.276 --> 05:59.844
and might not make it,
which completely destroys

05:59.877 --> 06:00.678
my seating chart,

06:00.711 --> 06:01.511
not to mention the fact that...

06:01.544 --> 06:02.412
Hey, hey, hey.

06:04.382 --> 06:07.285
I know you're missing
her very much right now,

06:08.819 --> 06:11.122
but I also know she's right here
with us.

06:12.590 --> 06:14.392
She would have been very proud
of you.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.560
You think so, Daddy?

06:18.596 --> 06:19.429
I know so.

06:21.699 --> 06:24.068
- Love you.
- I love you.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.543
Best night ever!

06:34.979 --> 06:36.781
Ooh, we're
here. Everyone out.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.957
Isn't this magnificent?

06:49.126 --> 06:50.795
What the hell is this shit?

06:51.662 --> 06:53.331
An art gallery, Heather?

06:53.364 --> 06:54.165
What?

06:54.198 --> 06:55.399
It's a wonderful event.

06:55.433 --> 06:56.466
Art is dead.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.102
How did you hear about this
party?

06:58.135 --> 06:59.704
Oh, I read about it somewhere.

06:59.737 --> 07:02.740
Ms. Papadopoulos, I
thought you couldn't make it?

07:02.773 --> 07:06.344
Let me just say, tonight
has been a huge success

07:06.377 --> 07:07.979
because of your planning.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.613
This is one of your events?

07:10.815 --> 07:11.615
What? No!

07:11.649 --> 07:13.617
I have no clue who that woman
is.

07:13.651 --> 07:14.484
Let's dance.

07:16.287 --> 07:18.823
Come on. We're going.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.091
How's the catering?

07:20.124 --> 07:20.925
Eh.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.093
Come on, Heather.

07:24.662 --> 07:25.930
I just needed
to make sure everything

07:25.963 --> 07:27.198
turned out all right.

07:27.231 --> 07:29.834
Yes, you're a great
event planner. We're leaving.

07:33.270 --> 07:35.039
Forget her and listen to us.

07:41.679 --> 07:42.480
Yeah!

07:42.512 --> 07:44.081
Titties!

07:44.115 --> 07:46.717
Whoopee. You've seen
my breasts. One day

07:46.751 --> 07:48.953
we'll all return to dust.

08:02.299 --> 08:03.768
You were pre-partying.

08:03.801 --> 08:04.602
What?

08:04.635 --> 08:05.636
You were totally pre-partying.

08:05.669 --> 08:07.071
Okay, maybe, like, a little.

08:07.104 --> 08:08.639
You pre-gamed without us?

08:15.413 --> 08:17.248
You girls lookin' for a good
time?

08:17.281 --> 08:18.548
God, no. Driver keep going!

08:18.582 --> 08:19.417
Get in.

08:27.391 --> 08:29.293
Then that man tried to
stiff me, and I was, like,

08:29.326 --> 08:33.330
'Oh, no, honey, you gon' pay Ms.
Pandora.

08:33.364 --> 08:36.734
or the wifey finds out about
our little rendezvous.'

08:36.767 --> 08:38.736
Oh, you go, Pandora!

08:38.769 --> 08:39.736
Cindy!

08:39.770 --> 08:40.770
She's fabulous.

08:42.273 --> 08:43.340
Hey, show us more titties!

08:43.374 --> 08:46.610
Yeah, and don't bum us out
this time.

08:51.849 --> 08:53.451
Drive, drive, drive.

08:53.484 --> 08:54.885
Hey!

09:00.324 --> 09:02.860
Wow.
What a great night.

09:02.893 --> 09:04.628
Yeah, throwing hours of
planning out

09:04.662 --> 09:05.896
the window is a blast.

09:05.930 --> 09:07.798
News flash: Your plan sucked.

09:07.832 --> 09:11.669
No, my plans were... Ooh,
I just got really dizzy.

09:11.702 --> 09:14.505
That brownie we gave
you earlier had pot in it.

09:15.940 --> 09:17.441
Come on.

09:17.475 --> 09:19.944
Don't be a rat.
Nobody likes a rat.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.879
Thanks for the hook-up,
Pandora.

09:21.912 --> 09:23.414
Mm-hmm.

09:23.447 --> 09:26.150
Why do you girls love
playing jokes on me so much?

09:26.183 --> 09:27.718
Because you're so serious.

09:27.751 --> 09:29.386
Yeah, and you didn't
used to be like that.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.056
Also, it's April 1st today.
We had to do something to you.

09:32.089 --> 09:34.892
The pot brownie was the best
we could come up with. For now.

09:34.925 --> 09:38.095
Oh, right. I almost forgot.
Act Like an Idiot Day.

09:38.129 --> 09:39.163
My favorite.

09:39.196 --> 09:41.465
I would pay a 100 bucks
to see you be an idiot.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.602
Yeah, not a snowball's chance
in hell

09:43.634 --> 09:45.169
of that ever happening.

09:49.574 --> 09:53.410
Okay. You three think I'm
a drag. I'll prove you wrong.

09:53.444 --> 09:54.613
I'll prank someone.

09:54.645 --> 09:56.147
Really?

09:56.180 --> 09:58.415
Oh my god, yes! Who?

10:11.262 --> 10:12.631
You look stoned.

10:12.663 --> 10:14.665
That's ridiculous. I don't do
drugs.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.601
Waiter, another Belgian waffle,
please!

10:19.604 --> 10:21.305
Can we talk about something?

10:21.338 --> 10:22.506
Sure.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.075
I've been thinking a lot
lately.

10:25.109 --> 10:26.277
About what?

10:26.310 --> 10:30.814
About us and, um, things
just haven't felt quite right.

10:30.848 --> 10:31.782
What do you mean?

10:31.815 --> 10:34.185
I mean, that spark, you know?

10:34.218 --> 10:35.686
We just don't have it.

10:35.719 --> 10:38.623
Oh, god, this is... this
is really hard to say.

10:39.624 --> 10:42.026
Bryce, I think we
should break up.

10:45.396 --> 10:46.263
Oh my god.

10:47.264 --> 10:48.799
I mean,

10:48.832 --> 10:49.668
wow.

10:50.834 --> 10:51.636
Oh my god.

10:51.670 --> 10:52.870
- April Foo...
- I've been thinking

10:52.903 --> 10:54.371
the exact same thing!

10:55.272 --> 10:56.073
Wait, what?

10:56.106 --> 10:57.908
I'm so glad you said it first.

10:57.942 --> 10:58.976
Said what?

10:59.009 --> 11:01.245
What we've both been
thinking for a long time.

11:01.278 --> 11:04.683
No, no, no, no, no.
Hold on one second. What?!

11:04.715 --> 11:06.250
I've just been agonizing
about the whole thing

11:06.283 --> 11:08.085
ever since you pressured
me to purpose to you.

11:08.118 --> 11:08.986
Pressured you?

11:09.019 --> 11:10.821
- I mean...
- I didn't pressure you!

11:10.854 --> 11:11.989
No, no, no. Of course not.

11:12.022 --> 11:15.259
I meant, uh, I didn't mean
pressured, I meant... bossed?

11:15.292 --> 11:17.928
I didn't boss you either!

11:17.962 --> 11:19.730
Okay, you're right.
I'm sorry, baby.

11:19.763 --> 11:21.566
I wanted to ask you.

11:21.600 --> 11:24.168
Then why do you
want to break up now?

11:24.201 --> 11:27.738
I don't want to break
up. We want to break up.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.107
I mean, come on. We never
have any good times together.

11:30.140 --> 11:32.509
Okay, what about our trip to
Napa, hm?

11:32.543 --> 11:33.844
That was three years ago.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.746
Well, what about our trip to
France?

11:35.779 --> 11:39.718
You took an event planning
gig while we were there.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.620
It was a wonderful
opportunity.

11:41.653 --> 11:44.455
I went on a sunset
river cruise by myself,

11:44.488 --> 11:48.125
I ate at the Eiffel Tower by
myself, I toured

11:48.158 --> 11:50.094
the entire Louvre by myself!

11:50.127 --> 11:51.663
And you loved it, by the way.

11:51.696 --> 11:53.665
Also, the whole time you
were...

11:55.899 --> 11:56.767
What?

11:56.800 --> 11:57.801
You know.

11:57.835 --> 11:59.837
No, I don't know, Bryce.

11:59.870 --> 12:00.705
What?

12:03.708 --> 12:04.541
PMS-ing.

12:04.576 --> 12:06.543
Oh!

12:06.578 --> 12:08.379
Excuse me, miss, could you
please...

12:08.412 --> 12:10.848
I was not PMS-ing.

12:10.881 --> 12:11.982
You weren't?

12:12.016 --> 12:13.618
No! I can't believe you would
think that. You are just

12:13.652 --> 12:16.186
like every stereotypical
guy in the whole world!

12:16.220 --> 12:18.556
'Oh, you're PMS-ing. Oh, you're
bossy.'

12:18.590 --> 12:19.724
You just called me a bitch.

12:19.758 --> 12:21.892
No, that is not what I said.

12:21.925 --> 12:24.895
Yes, you did, indirectly,
you called me a bitch.

12:24.928 --> 12:26.463
See? This is another thing.
You read

12:26.497 --> 12:27.565
into everything too much.

12:27.599 --> 12:29.133
What is that supposed to mean?

12:29.166 --> 12:33.772
Literally exactly what I just
said.

12:33.804 --> 12:34.905
What are you doing?

12:34.938 --> 12:36.440
I'm watching your hand
gestures to see if you're lying.

12:36.473 --> 12:37.709
I read about it in
The New Yorker.

12:37.742 --> 12:38.842
Stop it!

12:38.876 --> 12:40.044
Stop it!

12:40.077 --> 12:41.780
Heather! Okay.

12:41.812 --> 12:43.280
Listen, babe?

12:43.314 --> 12:45.249
I get what you're doing.
You're just playing

12:45.282 --> 12:47.518
devil's advocate to soften
the blow for both of us,

12:47.552 --> 12:49.788
but come on. It's not working.

12:49.820 --> 12:53.190
I mean, the sex? Pretty awful.

12:53.223 --> 12:55.225
What are you talking about?

12:55.259 --> 12:57.394
Come on, Heather. I know
you never really liked it.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.798
I mean, you would just lay
there and wait for me to finish

12:59.830 --> 13:01.198
and then I would feel
bad because I felt like

13:01.231 --> 13:03.601
I wasn't pleasing you,
but now I get it.

13:03.635 --> 13:05.737
You were just
acting like a dead fish

13:05.770 --> 13:08.972
because you were unhappy, and
I have been so miserable, too,

13:09.006 --> 13:11.710
and I feel so glad that we
are having this conversation.

13:11.743 --> 13:12.910
Man,

13:12.943 --> 13:13.877
whoo!

13:13.911 --> 13:15.680
I feel so liberated, you know?

13:15.714 --> 13:17.181
Mm!

13:17.214 --> 13:19.818
This is a joke,

13:19.850 --> 13:20.652
Bryce.

13:20.685 --> 13:22.986
You got it, baby.
It is a joke,

13:23.020 --> 13:25.222
because married people,
they should want each other,

13:25.255 --> 13:26.791
they should want to
be with each other,

13:26.825 --> 13:28.827
and we obviously don't.

13:28.859 --> 13:31.295
I am so glad you brought this
up, Heather.

13:31.328 --> 13:33.765
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:33.798 --> 13:35.432
We are still going to be
friends, okay?

13:36.533 --> 13:38.803
Oh my god. It's my parents.

13:38.837 --> 13:41.171
They are going to be so happy.

13:41.205 --> 13:42.072
They will?

13:42.106 --> 13:43.575
Mom, guess what!

13:43.608 --> 13:45.476
The wedding is off.

13:45.509 --> 13:47.211
Really? Yay!

13:47.244 --> 13:48.879
I can hear her from here.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.749
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

13:50.782 --> 13:53.117
I'm afraid we're out of Belgian
waffles.

13:54.552 --> 13:56.520
April Fools!

13:59.022 --> 13:59.858
Oh my god.

14:00.991 --> 14:04.094
Oh, ma'am? It was a joke.

14:04.128 --> 14:06.029
Ma'am? Shit.

14:06.063 --> 14:07.931
Ms. Papadopoulos,
here are your keys,

14:07.965 --> 14:09.834
and I have your roses,
just like you wanted.

14:09.868 --> 14:11.836
The Rodriguez wedding will be
fine.

14:11.870 --> 14:14.104
Ms. Papadopoulos? What do you
think of this table setting?

14:14.138 --> 14:15.506
The hydrangea blossoms look
good?

14:15.539 --> 14:18.208
Ms. Papadopoulos, I changed
the outfit for the servers.

14:18.242 --> 14:19.209
What do you think?

14:19.243 --> 14:20.645
Hey, Heather, bad news.

14:20.678 --> 14:22.946
The florist? Straight as an
arrow.

14:23.782 --> 14:26.618
Yeah, it was a little
pricey but, you know,

14:26.651 --> 14:29.821
I figured I could delay my
retirement for a little bit.

14:29.854 --> 14:31.522
Oh, there she is. Heather!

14:31.556 --> 14:32.791
Hey, sweetheart, I've
been looking for you.

14:32.824 --> 14:34.224
Daddy, can we talk?

14:34.258 --> 14:37.127
Of course, dear, in a second.
I have a surprise for you.

14:37.161 --> 14:39.163
Your whole family's here!

14:39.196 --> 14:40.799
Oh, Daddy, no, I can't right
now...

14:40.832 --> 14:42.634
Look, look, your aunt
Suzannah.

14:42.667 --> 14:47.639
Oh, my dear, you look just
beautiful.

14:49.072 --> 14:50.909
What's it been, eight years?

14:50.941 --> 14:52.877
She braved a six hour
flight from San Diego

14:52.911 --> 14:53.812
just to be here.

14:53.845 --> 14:56.046
Dry heaved into a bag the
whole time.

14:56.079 --> 14:57.381
That's

14:57.414 --> 14:58.415
awful.

14:58.449 --> 14:59.918
Yeah, and look who
else, look, look who came.

14:59.950 --> 15:01.952
Your grandfather Christos.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.288
My beautiful Heather.

15:04.321 --> 15:07.024
The last I saw you, you were
having your first communion.

15:07.057 --> 15:09.894
I took two planes for 12
hours just to be here.

15:09.928 --> 15:12.129
Hell on wheels on my
hemorrhoids.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.397
Isn't she worth it though?

15:13.430 --> 15:15.132
Well, we'll see about that,
won't we?

15:16.133 --> 15:17.367
Oh, I was just kidding.

15:17.401 --> 15:19.871
Oh, Christos.

15:19.904 --> 15:22.640
And perhaps the greatest
surprise of all,

15:22.674 --> 15:23.908
are you ready?

15:23.942 --> 15:26.678
Your great-grandmother Adonia!

15:26.711 --> 15:27.779
Where is she?

15:27.812 --> 15:30.949
There she is. Come on.
Wheel on in here.

15:30.981 --> 15:32.015
Get in here.

15:32.983 --> 15:34.719
You hadn't even taken
your first steps

15:34.752 --> 15:36.754
when she last saw you.
Can you believe it?

15:36.788 --> 15:39.791
And to think that she traveled
for a week just to get

15:39.824 --> 15:42.961
from her mountain home
to the nearest airstrip.

15:42.993 --> 15:45.229
And, uh, she missed a
couple of her flights, too.

15:45.262 --> 15:46.396
It was a real mess.

15:46.430 --> 15:49.934
Adonia, we are so
blessed to have you here.

15:49.968 --> 15:51.669
What do you think of my
daughter?

15:51.703 --> 15:52.536
Heather.

15:53.571 --> 15:56.240
Where's that handsome groom

15:56.273 --> 15:59.611
I've been staying alive to meet?

16:01.478 --> 16:02.914
Everyone, I, uh...

16:08.853 --> 16:12.022
He is not here right now.

16:13.023 --> 16:16.393
But I am sure I can find
him somewhere, so...

16:16.426 --> 16:17.929
Okay.

16:17.962 --> 16:20.330
Honey, what was it that you
wanted to talk to me about?

16:20.364 --> 16:21.365
Nothing, Daddy.

16:22.366 --> 16:23.935
- Just give me a second.
- Sure.

16:27.906 --> 16:29.506
Ms. Papadopoulos, how
would you us to decorate

16:29.540 --> 16:31.074
the area for the band?

16:31.108 --> 16:33.243
The wedding is off, Guillaume.

16:33.277 --> 16:34.077
Really?

16:34.111 --> 16:34.946
Oh my god.

16:36.848 --> 16:38.016
Mama,

16:38.048 --> 16:40.919
the baker just called. Ms.
Papadopoulos' wedding is off.

16:42.286 --> 16:45.723
I knew it.

16:55.532 --> 16:57.434
Oh, hey, Heather. This golf
course is great, isn't it?

16:57.467 --> 16:58.670
We should do more events here.

16:58.703 --> 17:01.071
Oh, also, that French guy,
Guillaume? You think he's out

17:01.104 --> 17:01.906
of my league?

17:01.940 --> 17:03.473
My wedding is ruined.

17:03.507 --> 17:05.242
Okay, what's the matter?
Did someone not deliver

17:05.275 --> 17:08.012
enough lilac-scented
candles for your Swarovski

17:08.046 --> 17:09.479
crystal candelabras?

17:09.512 --> 17:11.049
No, they delivered enough.

17:11.080 --> 17:12.916
Wow, I was totally
making that up.

17:12.951 --> 17:15.419
Okay, so why is
your wedding ruined?

17:15.452 --> 17:17.186
Bryce is out.

17:17.220 --> 17:18.056
What do you mean?

17:18.088 --> 17:19.624
Do you know
what today's date is?

17:19.656 --> 17:20.457
Wednesday.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.060
The date, Paul.

17:22.092 --> 17:24.294
April 1st? Oh, hey,
it's April Fools' Day.

17:24.328 --> 17:26.530
Yeah, and I decided to
prank Bryce by telling him

17:26.564 --> 17:28.531
we should call off the
wedding, and he felt

17:28.566 --> 17:30.200
the exact same way.

17:30.233 --> 17:32.336
What the hell is wrong with
you?

17:32.369 --> 17:34.171
I don't know.

17:34.204 --> 17:35.740
I mean, do you know how
much work I have put into

17:35.773 --> 17:39.577
this wedding? How many days,
weeks, months of planning?

17:39.611 --> 17:41.345
And what's it for now?
For nothing?

17:42.212 --> 17:43.047
Ugh!

17:45.049 --> 17:45.984
Holy cow.

17:46.017 --> 17:48.352
They were right.
Becky, Cindy, Gretchen.

17:48.385 --> 17:51.121
Everyone. I have no sense of
humor.

17:51.154 --> 17:53.290
I mean, how could I think
this was a funny joke?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.359
You know what else? The
cherry on top? They also think

17:55.392 --> 17:57.095
I'm un-fun. I should just
change my name to

17:57.127 --> 17:59.262
"Heather the Heart Attack."

17:59.296 --> 18:00.130
Ugh!

18:02.100 --> 18:03.735
Oh my, Heather,
you should go pro.

18:03.768 --> 18:05.970
This whole day is a disaster.

18:06.004 --> 18:08.072
Ugh, it is those stupid girls'
faults.

18:08.106 --> 18:09.539
They are the ones
who put me up to this.

18:09.574 --> 18:10.875
'Oh, Heather,
you're too Type A.'

18:10.908 --> 18:12.442
'Heather, you need to calm
down.'

18:12.476 --> 18:13.510
'Heather, you should relax.'

18:13.543 --> 18:15.479
'Heather, why don't you
loosen up a little bit?

18:15.512 --> 18:16.581
It'll all be fine.'

18:16.614 --> 18:18.348
Well, look where it got me.

18:18.382 --> 18:20.217
I don't know why I listen to
those girls.

18:20.250 --> 18:23.286
All they ever do is tease
me and play jokes on me.

18:24.889 --> 18:27.925
Oh my god.
That's all they ever do.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.426
How could I be so stupid?

18:29.459 --> 18:30.862
They told Bryce!

18:30.895 --> 18:32.997
I mean, they said it
themselves, the pot brownie

18:33.031 --> 18:34.966
was the best they could think of
so far.

18:34.999 --> 18:36.067
Pot brownie?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.769
Clearly they texted Bryce
or something when I was

18:37.802 --> 18:39.637
on my way to the restaurant
and told him about

18:39.671 --> 18:41.673
my little April Fools joke,
and then he flipped it

18:41.706 --> 18:42.539
back on me.

18:42.573 --> 18:44.008
God, Bryce is good.

18:44.042 --> 18:45.375
He's so quick on his feet.

18:45.409 --> 18:46.376
I have to go.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.612
Heather, hold on.

18:47.645 --> 18:49.013
"Hey,
you've reached Bryce Collins.

18:49.047 --> 18:49.914
Please leave me a message."

18:49.947 --> 18:51.849
Bryce, I'm on to you.

18:51.883 --> 18:53.084
Heather, just wait a second.

18:53.117 --> 18:55.053
Man, I can't wait to
see the look on his face.

18:55.086 --> 18:55.887
Heather, stop!

18:55.920 --> 18:57.121
What, Paul?

18:57.155 --> 19:01.025
You need to sit down
and gather your thoughts.

19:01.059 --> 19:02.927
I will not be made a fool.

19:15.205 --> 19:16.040
What the hell!

19:16.074 --> 19:19.010
My bad! Totally my fault.

19:26.050 --> 19:28.119
- April Fools!
- April Fools!

19:28.152 --> 19:29.453
That's not even a prank!

19:33.825 --> 19:34.859
Hi, Carol.
I'm going to see Bryce.

19:34.892 --> 19:37.494
Oh, Ms. Papadopoulos,
I think Bryce is...

19:46.738 --> 19:47.939
Ashley, I need to talk to
Bryce.

19:47.972 --> 19:49.741
Oh, Heather! Um, hi.

19:49.774 --> 19:51.876
Uh, Bryce isn't in
right now. He's meeting

19:51.909 --> 19:53.443
a client for coffee.

19:53.477 --> 19:54.846
So...

19:54.879 --> 19:56.214
How are you?

19:56.246 --> 19:57.582
What are you talking about?

19:57.615 --> 19:58.448
You know.

19:59.516 --> 20:01.152
Um, fine?

20:07.424 --> 20:09.861
Ashley,
everyone's staring at me.

20:09.894 --> 20:13.064
Heather, Bryce told us what
happened.

20:13.097 --> 20:14.132
He did?

20:14.165 --> 20:16.234
Yeah, he let us in
on it this morning.

20:16.266 --> 20:20.204
Oh! He let
you in on it, did he?

20:20.238 --> 20:21.973
Um, yes.

20:22.006 --> 20:23.440
Really?

20:23.473 --> 20:26.276
- Excuse me?
- Yes, excuse you.

20:26.309 --> 20:27.578
What are you talking about?

20:27.612 --> 20:29.513
What am I talking about?

20:30.615 --> 20:33.117
I'm sorry,
I'm completely lost.

20:33.151 --> 20:34.986
Ooh, you're good! I'm
surprised your acting career

20:35.019 --> 20:35.887
didn't work out.

20:38.421 --> 20:39.757
You're so mean!

20:41.692 --> 20:43.027
Oh,

20:43.060 --> 20:44.494
I see.

20:44.528 --> 20:47.665
I get this little insult
game we're playing.

20:47.698 --> 20:49.533
I really do not understand this
holiday.

20:49.567 --> 20:54.138
Um, okay, and you are
an incorrigible gossip.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.875
Heather, hey. Are you okay?

20:57.909 --> 20:59.309
We heard what you
did. You know, really,

20:59.342 --> 21:00.244
it was for the best.

21:00.278 --> 21:03.380
It sure was, you guys.

21:03.413 --> 21:04.882
Well, we'll miss seeing you
come in.

21:04.916 --> 21:07.484
Oh, I won't missing you,
Frank, or smelling you

21:07.517 --> 21:09.187
from a mile away,
for that matter.

21:09.220 --> 21:10.520
Oh, you're cool with it, huh?

21:10.555 --> 21:12.056
Great. Well, we won't miss you
at all.

21:12.089 --> 21:13.891
Good one.

21:13.925 --> 21:16.294
Hey, Heather, sorry about the
bad news.

21:16.326 --> 21:17.261
What bad news?

21:17.295 --> 21:18.830
Today is the
best day of my life.

21:18.863 --> 21:20.832
Oh, really? Then I want to
thank you.

21:20.865 --> 21:23.167
We had a little office
pool going and I totally

21:23.201 --> 21:24.569
picked today for the break up.

21:24.602 --> 21:26.137
I was a little iffy about
my decision at first,

21:26.170 --> 21:27.504
but then I was like,
'Nope! Wednesday's the day

21:27.537 --> 21:29.941
that this whole ticking
time bomb goes off!'

21:29.974 --> 21:31.642
You made me 300 bucks!

21:31.676 --> 21:33.778
Mister Money Bags!
Way to go, Jimbo.

21:33.811 --> 21:35.512
- My name's Carl.
- Who cares!

21:35.545 --> 21:37.114
Mrs. Worthington.

21:37.148 --> 21:39.416
Heather, you've chosen wisely.

21:39.449 --> 21:41.552
You know, I wasn't going to
promote Bryce

21:41.586 --> 21:43.654
because I figured he
wouldn't be able to handle

21:43.688 --> 21:45.690
the extra hours with
someone as high maintenance

21:45.723 --> 21:46.891
as you on his hands.

21:46.924 --> 21:50.928
You just did your ex-fiancé a
big favor.

21:50.962 --> 21:52.029
I commend you.

21:52.063 --> 21:54.932
Well, I don't commend you
on those self-proclaimed

21:54.966 --> 21:57.134
world-famous apple pies
of yours that you keep

21:57.168 --> 21:59.770
trying to get me to serve at
my events. They're garbage!

22:01.371 --> 22:04.242
Everyone, this has been fun.

22:04.275 --> 22:06.978
I'm just going to go back
to not preparing my wedding.

22:07.011 --> 22:08.980
See you all never again.

22:12.549 --> 22:15.019
Ah, Ms. Papadopoulos, on
behalf of the security force

22:15.052 --> 22:15.887
I thank you.

22:16.787 --> 22:20.157
You have set a good man free.

22:20.191 --> 22:22.627
The security guard and
janitor are in on this?

22:22.660 --> 22:24.494
Bryce really went all out.

22:24.527 --> 22:26.330
Thank you, Heather!
Way to go!

22:26.364 --> 22:27.530
Team Bryce!

22:27.565 --> 22:30.001
The people who don't even
work here are in on it? Ha!

22:32.303 --> 22:35.139
The wedding is back on, people!

22:38.475 --> 22:41.579
God, Heather, we're so
tired from last night.

22:41.612 --> 22:42.545
And hungover.

22:42.580 --> 22:44.615
And Cindy made out with
Pandora.

22:44.649 --> 22:46.117
Really, Cindy, Pandora?

22:46.150 --> 22:48.019
I'm going through a really
difficult time right now.

22:48.052 --> 22:50.855
Anyway, we did a little
retail therapy to feel better.

22:50.888 --> 22:52.857
It looks like you
looted the entire store.

22:52.890 --> 22:54.959
No we didn't! We
paid! Who said looted?

22:54.992 --> 22:57.728
It's cool, Heather. We
stayed within your dad's budget.

22:57.762 --> 22:59.830
He said we looked like
holy hell this morning

22:59.864 --> 23:02.499
so he gave us his Amex and told
us to go have a little fun.

23:02.532 --> 23:04.467
- So, we figured...
- Oh my god, you guys,

23:04.501 --> 23:07.104
my dad is already paying
all of your expenses.

23:07.138 --> 23:08.372
Including hotel rooms.

23:08.406 --> 23:10.641
Yeah, and you live, like,
10 minutes away, Cindy.

23:10.675 --> 23:12.343
These two aren't
staying here without me.

23:12.376 --> 23:14.011
I need this right now.

23:14.045 --> 23:16.546
Cindy, you're an investment
banker. Becky, you're

23:16.580 --> 23:19.449
an attorney, and, Gretchen,
you work for NASA.

23:19.482 --> 23:22.954
Yeah, that's right. I work
at NASA. On... the rockets!

23:22.987 --> 23:25.990
Just chill, Heather. Your
dad was totally cool with it.

23:26.023 --> 23:28.926
Anyway, how did the prank go
this morning?

23:28.960 --> 23:31.896
Oh, right. The prank.

23:31.929 --> 23:33.698
Why don't you tell me how it
went?

23:33.731 --> 23:36.300
Um... it was funny?

23:36.334 --> 23:38.970
Yes, it was hilarious.

23:39.003 --> 23:39.904
Keep it up, girls.

23:39.937 --> 23:41.005
What are you talking about?

23:41.038 --> 23:44.709
Ah, okay, I know what
you want to hear. You won!

23:44.742 --> 23:46.043
Okay? Are you happy?

23:46.077 --> 23:49.714
Now, if you don't mind, I have
some business to return to.

23:49.747 --> 23:52.183
Um, okay, weirdo.

23:52.216 --> 23:55.119
Come on, girls. I'm ready
to trash it up in these new

23:55.152 --> 23:57.054
Louboutin's and jump right on to

23:57.088 --> 23:58.622
that cute bellhop's di...

23:58.656 --> 24:03.561
Huh! Oh, excellent! I got
my grand jury indictment.

24:03.594 --> 24:04.829
Ooh, you guys want to call
Pandora

24:04.862 --> 24:05.896
and see what she's up to?

24:05.930 --> 24:07.530
I think she only has
email.

24:09.033 --> 24:12.436
Mama, the DJ just called.
Her wedding's back on.

24:25.983 --> 24:27.284
Good morning, Bryce.

24:28.819 --> 24:30.855
Oh, baby, baby, baby, I'm
so sorry. I'm so sorry

24:30.888 --> 24:31.989
if I startled you.

24:32.023 --> 24:33.858
I know you're always so
jumpy when you first wake up.

24:33.891 --> 24:34.692
No, I'm not.

24:34.725 --> 24:35.559
Yes, you are.

24:35.593 --> 24:37.294
What are you doing here?

24:37.328 --> 24:38.528
Bravo,

24:38.562 --> 24:39.730
bravo,

24:39.764 --> 24:41.665
bravo.

24:41.699 --> 24:42.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:42.532 --> 24:43.801
All right, you can stop it
now.

24:43.834 --> 24:44.702
Stop what?

24:44.735 --> 24:46.270
What is going on?

24:46.303 --> 24:47.838
Did you sleep in
my bed last night?

24:47.872 --> 24:49.940
Of course! I didn't want
to wake you when I came in.

24:49.974 --> 24:51.709
You are going to need all the
sleep you can get when you get

24:51.742 --> 24:52.977
that new promotion.

24:53.010 --> 24:53.978
I got the promotion?

24:54.011 --> 24:55.479
Oops. Your boss told
me when I stopped by

24:55.513 --> 24:57.681
your office yesterday. Act
surprised when she tells you.

24:57.715 --> 24:59.617
Why were you in my office?

24:59.650 --> 25:01.886
Well, I had to call you
out on your little prank.

25:01.919 --> 25:04.488
Obviously, you found out
about my prank and you flipped

25:04.522 --> 25:07.958
it back on me. Very clever.
But I figured it out.

25:08.893 --> 25:11.495
Stop! You were kidding
about the break up?

25:11.529 --> 25:14.098
It was April Fools' Day. I
don't know what came over me.

25:14.131 --> 25:16.400
That is a terrible joke.

25:16.434 --> 25:18.035
I agree. In general, I hate
jokes,

25:18.069 --> 25:19.670
so let's just drop it, okay?

25:19.703 --> 25:21.972
I wasn't kidding. I
don't want to get married.

25:22.006 --> 25:23.140
We're not right for each other.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.341
Ha, ha, very funny.

25:24.375 --> 25:26.510
No, I'm serious. We're not.

25:26.544 --> 25:27.645
Yes, we are.

25:27.678 --> 25:29.413
No, we're not.

25:31.749 --> 25:33.050
Oh, man.

25:33.084 --> 25:33.918
Heather.

25:35.352 --> 25:36.153
Listen, this is...

25:37.421 --> 25:38.956
You asshole!

25:38.989 --> 25:42.026
I have been planning this wedding
for the last seven months,

25:42.059 --> 25:43.894
mostly by myself because
you've been too busy to help.

25:43.928 --> 25:46.297
I have been working 16-hour
days for the last month

25:46.330 --> 25:48.666
and I rented the ballroom
for a week, just to make sure

25:48.699 --> 25:51.135
that everything was
perfect, and now you don't

25:51.168 --> 25:52.169
want to marry me?

25:52.203 --> 25:53.637
Screw you, prick!

25:53.671 --> 25:54.705
Hey!

25:54.738 --> 25:57.274
You're the one who pulled
this stupid prank on me.

25:57.308 --> 26:00.344
I'm sorry I reacted honestly.

26:02.113 --> 26:04.281
So, what, you've just
hated me the whole time

26:04.315 --> 26:05.149
we've been together?

26:05.182 --> 26:09.554
No. I mean,
it was great at first.

26:09.588 --> 26:11.822
We had a lot of laughs.
It worked.

26:11.856 --> 26:12.923
I loved you.

26:12.957 --> 26:15.626
What's the problem now
then? Why don't you love me?

26:16.827 --> 26:20.431
Come on, Heather. You
can't see we've grown apart?

26:20.464 --> 26:23.568
Look, some things last and
some things don't, that's all.

26:23.602 --> 26:25.703
And it was great while it
lasted, but...

26:27.438 --> 26:29.473
You don't really
want to marry me.

26:29.507 --> 26:31.208
You just want the Facebook
photos.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.614
No, that is not true.

26:35.646 --> 26:36.615
I love you, Bryce.

26:37.748 --> 26:38.583
Fine.

26:39.717 --> 26:41.719
Then, I'm sorry.

26:43.053 --> 26:44.688
I just don't want to marry you.

26:45.990 --> 26:47.324
Why didn't you
say something earlier?

26:47.358 --> 26:49.093
I mean, why did you even
propose?

26:49.126 --> 26:51.962
I don't know, I mean, because

26:51.996 --> 26:53.297
you can be kind of controlling.

26:53.330 --> 26:54.498
Oh, that's right. I forgot.
We already

26:54.532 --> 26:55.666
talked about this.

26:55.699 --> 26:57.935
I bossed you into getting
me a ring and then I bossed

26:57.968 --> 26:59.604
you into getting down on
one knee and then I bossed

26:59.638 --> 27:00.504
you into proposing to me.

27:00.538 --> 27:01.972
Yeah, you know what?
You kind of did.

27:02.006 --> 27:03.107
Really? How?

27:03.140 --> 27:06.277
Heather, you've got this way
about you.

27:07.344 --> 27:09.313
It's what makes you a
good event planner.

27:09.346 --> 27:11.616
It's what's going to make
you great mom someday.

27:11.650 --> 27:13.751
It's what helps you do what
so many people in this world

27:13.784 --> 27:15.953
can't do,
which is get things done.

27:15.986 --> 27:17.589
Okay.

27:17.622 --> 27:18.455
I get it.

27:19.957 --> 27:23.093
I push people, so I'll
stop pushing people, okay?

27:23.127 --> 27:23.994
No, Heather.

27:24.028 --> 27:25.296
What?

27:25.329 --> 27:27.164
What, Bryce? If you have
something to say just spit it out.

27:27.198 --> 27:29.200
Sometimes you can
be a real bitch.

27:30.167 --> 27:32.236
Ah! Stop hitting me!

27:32.269 --> 27:34.338
I am not a bitch.
Go to hell, Bryce.

27:34.371 --> 27:36.740
You know what? I never
want to see you again!

27:36.774 --> 27:39.043
- Oh, it is mutual.
- Great!

27:39.076 --> 27:40.544
Perfect.

27:40.579 --> 27:43.080
Wait. What am I
doing? This is my place.

27:43.113 --> 27:44.014
You get out of here.

27:44.048 --> 27:45.584
- Good! I was just leaving!
- Fantastic.

27:45.617 --> 27:46.417
Ugh!

27:46.450 --> 27:47.251
Hey, Heather?

27:47.284 --> 27:48.085
What?

27:48.118 --> 27:48.953
Your key.

27:50.087 --> 27:50.921
Really?

27:59.797 --> 28:03.200
Fine. You can hold on to it
if it makes you feel better.

28:03.234 --> 28:04.034
Heather.

28:04.068 --> 28:04.902
Bye, Bryce.

28:09.873 --> 28:10.841
Ms. Papadopoulos...

28:10.874 --> 28:12.910
Beat it, Guillaume.
The wedding is off!

28:12.943 --> 28:15.012
Wait. It is or you are
messing with us again?

28:15.045 --> 28:16.013
We need to know.

28:16.046 --> 28:17.314
You're torturing us.

28:21.485 --> 28:22.621
Oh, hey, Heather!

28:22.654 --> 28:24.788
Did you know they have kayaks
here, too?

28:24.822 --> 28:25.990
Oh, also, bad news.

28:26.023 --> 28:28.727
That French guy Guillaume?
Straight as an arrow.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.695
Bryce wasn't joking, Paul.

28:30.729 --> 28:33.598
I can't hear you. Hold
on. I'll paddle back in.

28:36.033 --> 28:38.969
I got this. Just give me
a sec. Just one second.

28:40.170 --> 28:42.039
Bryce wasn't joking, Paul.

28:42.072 --> 28:42.940
Jesus!

28:42.973 --> 28:45.409
He really doesn't want to
marry me.

28:45.442 --> 28:47.646
Oh my god. They weren't joking
either.

28:47.679 --> 28:49.880
His coworkers? They
all want us to break up.

28:49.913 --> 28:51.415
They had an office pool going.

28:51.448 --> 28:53.284
Jimbo made 300 bucks.

28:53.317 --> 28:54.686
Nice, Jimbo.

28:54.719 --> 28:56.387
Everyone hates me.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.690
Hey, not everyone hates you.

28:58.723 --> 29:00.391
Really? Who doesn't?

29:01.258 --> 29:02.694
Uh...

29:02.727 --> 29:04.094
You?

29:04.128 --> 29:05.796
I'm going to have to tell
my dad the wedding's off.

29:05.829 --> 29:06.997
He's going to hate me, too.

29:07.031 --> 29:09.400
I've wasted so much of his
money. The dress alone

29:09.433 --> 29:11.302
could buy a decent used car.

29:11.335 --> 29:13.037
Maybe even a new one,
you know, since you paid

29:13.070 --> 29:14.773
double to steal it from
the Rodriguez girl.

29:14.805 --> 29:16.874
I didn't steal it
from the Rodriguez girl.

29:16.907 --> 29:17.808
I outbid.

29:17.841 --> 29:21.378
Hey, it was still really,
really mean.

29:21.412 --> 29:23.480
Get back to work. I'm
not paying you to kayak.

29:23.514 --> 29:24.348
Fine.

29:25.717 --> 29:27.552
I can come back in,
I swear. I just...

29:32.156 --> 29:33.324
What the hell?

29:35.426 --> 29:37.161
Heather, there you are.

29:37.194 --> 29:38.730
Daddy, I have some bad news.

29:38.763 --> 29:40.197
Well, I'm sure
we could work it.

29:40.230 --> 29:42.099
You can tell me all about it...

29:42.132 --> 29:44.703
after you see who made it to
your wedding.

29:44.736 --> 29:46.503
Your cousin Bobby!

29:46.537 --> 29:48.105
Heather!

29:48.138 --> 29:50.307
You've got to be kidding me.

29:50.341 --> 29:53.645
Hey, Bobby, it is so great to
see you.

29:53.678 --> 29:55.179
It is so great to see you,
Heather,

29:55.212 --> 29:56.980
I'm so glad I could make it.

29:57.014 --> 29:58.515
Man, it was not an easy trip,
you know,

29:58.549 --> 29:59.684
because of my wheelchair.

29:59.718 --> 30:01.185
Right. Yeah. I got that.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.655
So where's Bryce? I heard
Bryce was an Eagle Scout

30:03.688 --> 30:05.824
when he was my age. I
just made Eagle last month

30:05.856 --> 30:07.759
and I want to compare
merit badges with him.

30:07.792 --> 30:10.027
My scoutmaster said I
wouldn't be able to get a lot

30:10.060 --> 30:11.830
of the badges, because
I can't walk at all,

30:11.862 --> 30:13.330
but I did it anyway!

30:13.364 --> 30:14.932
Bryce is...

30:16.701 --> 30:18.369
not here right now.

30:18.402 --> 30:21.105
He's just very busy at work.

30:21.138 --> 30:22.506
Okay. Excuse me.

30:22.539 --> 30:24.609
Uh, sweetheart,

30:24.642 --> 30:26.678
what was the bad news?

30:26.711 --> 30:28.011
It's fine.

30:28.045 --> 30:29.146
I'm figuring it out.

30:42.861 --> 30:45.095
Everybody,
the wedding is back on!

30:48.733 --> 30:50.167
Heather, for God's
sake, what are you doing?

30:50.200 --> 30:52.035
I have a plan, Paul.

30:52.069 --> 30:52.871
What plan?

30:52.903 --> 30:54.238
There is literally no other
plan.

30:54.271 --> 30:57.107
Groom or no groom? Oh, no
groom? Well, no wedding!

30:57.141 --> 30:58.041
Ms. Galápagos?

30:58.075 --> 30:59.443
It's Papadopoulos.

30:59.476 --> 31:00.845
I finished the adjustments for
Bryce.

31:00.879 --> 31:02.379
Would he like to try on the
tuxedo?

31:02.413 --> 31:03.213
Excuse me.

31:03.247 --> 31:04.783
He's not here right now.

31:04.816 --> 31:06.150
Oh! Use this guy!

31:06.183 --> 31:07.017
Ow!

31:10.521 --> 31:12.456
No, no, no, no, no.

31:12.489 --> 31:14.258
Listen, I can get Bryce to
come around.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.761
We just need to sit down and
talk this out like grown-ups.

31:16.795 --> 31:18.830
There is nothing in this
world that can't be fixed

31:18.863 --> 31:19.798
with hard work.

31:19.831 --> 31:22.667
Oh, right. I'm sorry.
It's just that simple.

31:22.700 --> 31:25.302
Uh, Ms. Papadopoulos,
I need Bryce's finalized

31:25.335 --> 31:26.170
guest list.

31:26.203 --> 31:27.806
Right. Of course.

31:27.839 --> 31:32.844
Um, okay, there is his mother,
his father, his sister, uh...

31:34.178 --> 31:35.412
some other people.

31:35.446 --> 31:38.382
Wait, no, he has two
sisters, there's two of them,

31:38.415 --> 31:40.585
and then, um, he has this
hairy friend, he looks like

31:40.618 --> 31:42.419
he's a homeless man.

31:42.453 --> 31:44.889
Does hairy friend have a name?

31:44.923 --> 31:47.958
Just "Hairy Friend"
should be good.

31:47.991 --> 31:50.160
You want me to put "Hairy
Friend" on his seating placard?

31:50.194 --> 31:53.598
Mm-hmm, yup, yup, he will
think that that is hilarious.

31:53.631 --> 31:57.000
He and Bryce are old pals,
just laughing about that stuff.

31:57.034 --> 31:59.604
Um, you know, Bryce's whole
family will be in town

31:59.637 --> 32:02.206
before the rehearsal dinner,
so let's just handle that then.

32:03.842 --> 32:05.476
Are you seriously just
going move forward with

32:05.509 --> 32:06.477
the wedding without Bryce?

32:06.510 --> 32:08.111
It won't be without Bryce.

32:08.145 --> 32:09.848
I'm going to talk him back into
it, okay?

32:09.881 --> 32:11.649
I mean, he was in love with
me a week ago.

32:11.683 --> 32:13.551
What's so different between
a week ago and today?

32:13.585 --> 32:15.385
It's not something you
just turn off like that.

32:15.419 --> 32:17.956
Have you ever been broken
up with ever in your life?

32:17.988 --> 32:19.223
No. Why?

32:19.256 --> 32:22.125
Oh, Heather, you don't
even know how many siblings

32:22.159 --> 32:24.562
Bryce has. Maybe it's time
you consider the possibility...

32:24.596 --> 32:26.163
Enough, Paul, okay?

32:26.196 --> 32:28.432
I have this under control.
I can fix this

32:28.465 --> 32:29.801
because you want to know why?

32:29.834 --> 32:34.171
I am an event planner, damn
it! I live for this stuff!

32:34.204 --> 32:35.907
- Ms. Papadopoulos?
- What!

32:35.940 --> 32:38.175
I have some questions about
your music

32:38.208 --> 32:39.409
selection for the DJ.

32:39.443 --> 32:43.313
Ah. Good. Something for me.

32:43.347 --> 32:44.381
What can I do for you?

32:44.414 --> 32:47.518
Okay, um, would Bryce
like to add any songs?

32:47.552 --> 32:48.753
Mm-hmm.

32:50.588 --> 32:51.823
I, um...

32:51.856 --> 32:55.025
I, uh, we could try,

32:55.058 --> 32:57.562
what is that stuff I hate so
much?

32:57.595 --> 32:59.229
Simon and Garfunkel.
Yup, he loves them,

32:59.263 --> 33:00.932
so anything by them you
could just play that.

33:00.965 --> 33:02.934
He'll love it at the wedding,
which he's going to be at,

33:02.967 --> 33:06.203
it's going to, it's great,
Simon and Garfunkel, mm-hmm.

33:06.236 --> 33:08.472
Mama, the catering company
just called.

33:08.505 --> 33:11.441
Her wedding's back off
again... maybe?

33:11.475 --> 33:14.779
This is bullshit.

33:16.513 --> 33:17.715
- Hey!
- Hey, there's a line.

33:17.749 --> 33:18.583
What the hell?

33:19.684 --> 33:21.753
I planned your daughter's
bat mitzvah, Mrs. Stein,

33:21.786 --> 33:23.821
your boa constrictor's funeral,
weirdo,

33:23.855 --> 33:25.723
and your mistress' birthday
party, Mr. Langdale,

33:25.757 --> 33:28.158
which I was very discreet about.

33:28.191 --> 33:30.662
I think you all can wait two
seconds.

33:30.695 --> 33:32.597
Espresso. Triple shot. Thanks.

33:32.630 --> 33:33.698
"Hey,
you've reached Bryce Collins.

33:33.731 --> 33:34.632
Please leave me a message."

33:34.666 --> 33:36.400
Hi. It's me.

33:37.367 --> 33:41.204
Listen, I get it. Things
between us maybe haven't been

33:41.238 --> 33:46.243
perfect lately. Also, I know
I can be difficult sometimes.

33:47.311 --> 33:50.480
There. I said it. See?
I'm not totally unaware,

33:50.514 --> 33:52.951
but I've learned my lesson,
Bryce, I promise, okay?

33:52.984 --> 33:55.820
So let's just get together
and talk about it, okay?

33:55.853 --> 33:59.023
Maybe tonight over dinner at
the Trattoria. Your favorite.

33:59.057 --> 34:01.025
I'll go ahead and make a
reservation for 8 p.m., okay?

34:01.059 --> 34:02.894
Just call me before you
leave work to confirm,

34:02.927 --> 34:05.462
and, Bryce, I feel confident
we can work things out.

34:06.731 --> 34:08.331
I'm ready to change for you.

34:08.364 --> 34:10.233
Okay, bye. Talk to you later.
Ooh!

34:10.266 --> 34:11.368
I love you.

34:14.170 --> 34:14.973
Hi, Ms.
Papadopoulos,

34:15.005 --> 34:16.440
Jaime at the tabernacle choir

34:16.473 --> 34:18.475
calling to confirm that
we were able to reschedule

34:18.507 --> 34:20.978
our Lincoln Center performance
to sing at your wedding.

34:21.012 --> 34:22.478
Hello,
Ms. Papadopoulos, it's Bill from

34:22.512 --> 34:23.480
William Morris Endeavor.

34:23.513 --> 34:25.181
Just wanted to let you
know that Mr. Summers

34:25.215 --> 34:27.619
will indeed wrap his movie in
time to direct your wedding

34:27.652 --> 34:29.053
video this weekend.

34:29.087 --> 34:30.855
Hi,
Ms. Papadopoulos, Sally calling

34:30.888 --> 34:33.024
to say that, yes, we were
able to teach the monarch

34:33.056 --> 34:34.926
butterflies to perch on top of
the harp.

34:47.437 --> 34:48.873
Can you spare some change?

34:51.909 --> 34:53.745
Here is the marriage
license. Is your fiancé

34:53.777 --> 34:54.679
on his way now?

34:54.712 --> 34:57.547
You know, um, he's not here
right now,

34:57.582 --> 34:59.984
but I have a copy of his
driver's license

35:00.018 --> 35:02.086
and his birth certificate,
oh, and I have some

35:02.120 --> 35:02.987
of his mail.

35:03.021 --> 35:06.691
So I'm sure you are very busy,

35:06.724 --> 35:08.458
so I could just sign the
marriage license

35:08.492 --> 35:09.794
and then we can
both be on our way.

35:09.827 --> 35:11.863
Ms. Papadopoulos, I'm
going to need to witness

35:11.896 --> 35:14.932
both you and your fiancé
signing the license.

35:14.966 --> 35:17.935
All right. He should
be done parking shortly.

35:24.108 --> 35:26.144
Hello. Hi.

35:28.112 --> 35:29.814
Do you still need that change?

35:36.654 --> 35:38.388
You're Bryce Collins?

35:38.422 --> 35:39.222
Yup, that's me.

35:39.256 --> 35:40.490
Yup, that's Bill.

35:42.093 --> 35:43.293
I mean, that's...

35:44.194 --> 35:45.495
Rice.

35:47.065 --> 35:49.767
This is my
buddy Rice.

35:49.801 --> 35:50.768
What kind of name is Rice?

35:50.802 --> 35:52.335
All right. Can we sign now?

35:52.369 --> 35:53.738
Yes.

35:53.771 --> 35:54.972
After you kiss him.

35:57.075 --> 35:57.875
I'm sorry?

35:57.909 --> 35:59.409
After you kiss your fiancé.

36:00.444 --> 36:01.545
Okay, give me the pen.

36:01.579 --> 36:03.114
Sure thing, just as soon as

36:03.147 --> 36:04.982
you two lovebirds lock lips.

36:05.016 --> 36:06.316
You're serious?

36:06.349 --> 36:07.350
This is ridiculous.

36:08.886 --> 36:09.954
Him?

36:09.987 --> 36:12.023
This is the man you love.
What's a little kiss?

36:12.056 --> 36:13.124
Yeah, what is a little kiss?

36:13.157 --> 36:14.726
Yeah, what's a little kiss?

36:17.327 --> 36:19.429
All right. Fine.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.812
Okay, give me that pen now.

36:34.846 --> 36:37.715
Ms. Papadopoulos, I can't
let you sign this license.

36:37.749 --> 36:39.183
Why not? I just kissed him?

36:39.217 --> 36:41.451
Clearly, this man is not Bryce
Collins.

36:41.485 --> 36:42.754
Sir, when is your birthday?

36:42.787 --> 36:46.124
Trick question.
I don't have one.

36:46.157 --> 36:48.693
His birthday is July 15th, and
he's just

36:48.726 --> 36:51.062
a little buzzed from his
bachelor party last night, okay?

36:51.095 --> 36:53.497
This is my fiancé Bryce.

36:53.530 --> 36:56.134
I kissed him and a deal
is a deal. We're signing

36:56.167 --> 36:57.034
that marriage license.

36:57.068 --> 36:58.502
Please vacate the premises.

36:58.535 --> 36:59.336
No!

36:59.369 --> 37:00.705
Goodbye, Ms. Papadopoulos.

37:00.738 --> 37:02.006
- Give it to me.
- Not happening.

37:02.039 --> 37:03.574
- Give it to me.
- Ma'am, I'm going to need you

37:03.608 --> 37:05.710
- to calm down.
- No, let go of me!

37:05.743 --> 37:06.577
Let go of me!

37:06.611 --> 37:08.478
Let go of me!

37:08.512 --> 37:09.947
Someone call the police!

37:12.150 --> 37:13.316
Keep moving forward, ma'am.

37:13.350 --> 37:16.353
To serve and to protect,
more like to be a couple jerks.

37:16.386 --> 37:17.922
Let go of me!

37:27.665 --> 37:30.333
Hi, Bryce, it's me. Heather.

37:30.367 --> 37:32.136
Um, you know, I was just thrown
into jail,

37:32.170 --> 37:34.437
so I am not entirely sure
I can make dinner tonight,

37:34.471 --> 37:36.674
but I wanted to let you
know that I still very much

37:36.707 --> 37:38.276
so want to work things out.

37:38.308 --> 37:39.944
Okay, just give me a call back.

37:40.945 --> 37:42.013
In jail.

37:42.046 --> 37:44.481
I don't really know what
the number here is, uh,

37:44.514 --> 37:46.050
or you can just let my
father know that I'm here

37:46.083 --> 37:47.852
because you were my one call.

37:47.885 --> 37:49.587
Okay. Bye!

38:14.812 --> 38:16.614
Hey, I know you.

38:16.647 --> 38:19.750
One of your friends
won't stop emailing me.

38:19.784 --> 38:23.020
Oh, great. Shouldn't you
be in the other holding cell?

38:23.054 --> 38:25.022
Honey, I'm all woman.

38:25.056 --> 38:27.925
Yeah, and I'm all
Hells Angels biker chick.

38:27.959 --> 38:31.762
Lady friend, you need to
relax and go with the flow.

38:31.796 --> 38:34.098
You're like a fabulous
fortune cookie, aren't you?

38:34.131 --> 38:39.136
You've gotten
funnier since I last seen you.

38:53.751 --> 38:56.354
Can I ask you something?

38:56.386 --> 38:57.655
Am I a bitch?

38:57.688 --> 38:58.521
Yes.

39:00.791 --> 39:02.894
Now can I ask you something?

39:04.795 --> 39:05.796
Am I a queen?

39:06.864 --> 39:07.899
Yes.

39:07.932 --> 39:11.769
And is that a drunk
over there, and a junkie

39:11.802 --> 39:14.972
right there, and some
girl who got mixed up

39:15.006 --> 39:16.874
with the wrong crowd over there?

39:19.243 --> 39:20.044
Yes.

39:20.077 --> 39:21.379
That's right.

39:21.411 --> 39:25.082
But since I've been in
this cell, that drunk

39:25.116 --> 39:28.485
bummed me a cigarette she
snuck in from outside.

39:28.518 --> 39:31.856
That junkie blocked
everyone's view while I used

39:31.889 --> 39:35.092
the toilet, and that
girl gave me a sandwich

39:35.126 --> 39:36.761
'cause I was hungry.

39:36.794 --> 39:39.864
They may be this, that,
or the other thing,

39:39.897 --> 39:42.833
but they're still good people.

39:43.801 --> 39:45.535
So, yes,

39:45.569 --> 39:46.771
you're a bitch,

39:48.005 --> 39:52.542
but are you still a good person?

40:01.185 --> 40:02.620
Papa John's.

40:02.653 --> 40:03.888
It's Papadopoulos!

40:05.556 --> 40:06.924
You made bail.

40:06.958 --> 40:09.994
How on earth did you get
yourself arrested, Heather?

40:10.027 --> 40:11.395
It was blown out of
proportion. I just got into

40:11.429 --> 40:12.495
a little tiff at City Hall.

40:12.529 --> 40:14.732
Hey, if we hurry we can
still make our reservation

40:14.765 --> 40:15.766
at the Trattoria.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.402
I'm sorry. You got
into a fight at City Hall?

40:18.436 --> 40:19.704
What the hell were you even
doing there?

40:19.737 --> 40:22.807
Oh, you know. Getting
our marriage license.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.342
Getting our marriage license?!

40:24.375 --> 40:26.243
Okay, look, it was on
the schedule for today

40:26.277 --> 40:28.346
and I had to stick to the
plan even if things between

40:28.379 --> 40:30.982
us are still, you know,
technically TBD.

40:31.015 --> 40:32.549
TBD?!

40:32.583 --> 40:35.619
We pretty clearly broke
up, like, six hours ago,

40:35.653 --> 40:37.121
for the second time!

40:37.154 --> 40:39.090
And, now, you're back.

40:39.123 --> 40:43.060
Yeah, I'm back because
you called me and told me

40:43.094 --> 40:44.295
you were in jail!

40:45.396 --> 40:46.630
What else was I supposed to do?

40:46.664 --> 40:48.032
You could have called
my father and had him come

40:48.065 --> 40:50.434
and get me, but you didn't.
You came, and I think

40:50.468 --> 40:52.670
that's because, deep down,
you still really want to

40:52.703 --> 40:53.838
work this out.

40:53.871 --> 40:55.606
Bryce, we're meant to be
together.

40:55.639 --> 40:57.475
I mean, we met because
you gave me your jacket

40:57.507 --> 40:59.577
when I got caught in the rain.

40:59.610 --> 41:00.811
I knew right away it was fate.

41:00.845 --> 41:03.781
You hated that jacket.
You donated it to Goodwill

41:03.814 --> 41:04.615
without even telling me.

41:04.648 --> 41:06.050
Yeah, it was so ugly.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.517
My father gave it to me.

41:07.551 --> 41:09.220
What about when you threw
me that surprise party?

41:09.253 --> 41:11.989
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

41:12.023 --> 41:14.291
You found out about that
party a week beforehand,

41:14.325 --> 41:17.128
canceled all my plans,
hired a new caterer, changed

41:17.161 --> 41:19.430
the location, sent out a
whole different invite list.

41:19.463 --> 41:21.098
I was an hour late becau...

41:21.132 --> 41:22.433
Yeah, what was that about, by
the way?

41:22.466 --> 41:24.168
I couldn't find the damn
place!

41:24.201 --> 41:25.469
Oh my god, Heather!

41:25.503 --> 41:26.536
Poor planning, Bryce.

41:26.570 --> 41:30.207
You are so controlling
you can't even let people

41:30.241 --> 41:31.541
do nice things for you.

41:31.575 --> 41:34.912
Well, I just wanted
your surprise party for me

41:34.945 --> 41:37.782
to be successful,
and it was, wasn't it?

41:37.815 --> 41:40.551
Yeah. It was your
best event yet.

41:40.584 --> 41:41.419
See?

41:44.755 --> 41:46.090
All these things you've
listed, the reasons

41:46.123 --> 41:48.993
why we're meant to be
together, those are all things

41:49.026 --> 41:50.928
that I did for you.

41:52.930 --> 41:56.801
Well, maybe that's because
it's easier to remember

41:56.834 --> 42:00.771
the grand, sweeping gestures,
and that's how you show love.

42:00.805 --> 42:04.475
Maybe I show love in smaller
ways that are more difficult

42:04.508 --> 42:07.278
to remember, like how
I'll always rub your feet

42:07.311 --> 42:09.513
when you have a hard day at
work, or when I would leave

42:09.547 --> 42:11.615
work early and surprise you
with a home-cooked dinner

42:11.649 --> 42:12.683
at your place.

42:12.716 --> 42:14.351
Or what about that time
I threw that wonderful

42:14.385 --> 42:15.820
little impromptu gathering
for you and your friends

42:15.853 --> 42:17.888
while you were watching
the barbarian death match?

42:17.922 --> 42:19.090
The Super Bowl?

42:19.123 --> 42:20.691
Did you forget about that
stuff while you were setting

42:20.724 --> 42:22.927
tee off times with your
buddies, or logging hours on

42:22.960 --> 42:24.829
the slopes, schmoozing
your boss and her friends

42:24.862 --> 42:26.097
on her yacht.

42:26.130 --> 42:27.264
It's a catamaran.

42:27.298 --> 42:29.233
Bryce, maybe you just
never took the time

42:29.266 --> 42:31.001
to understand me.

42:31.035 --> 42:33.572
You're all about the fun
stuff, but you run away

42:33.604 --> 42:35.072
as soon as it's time for the
hard work,

42:35.106 --> 42:37.341
just like you ran away the
other day at breakfast.

42:37.374 --> 42:39.143
I mean, you left me with this
whole mess and you didn't

42:39.176 --> 42:40.478
even think twice about it.

42:41.979 --> 42:43.814
Maybe you need to grow
up a little bit, too.

42:47.084 --> 42:48.385
Whatever.

42:48.419 --> 42:50.788
Bryce, come on. We're
perfect for each other.

42:50.821 --> 42:53.624
We're Bryce and Heather!
No, wait. Heather and Bryce.

42:53.657 --> 42:54.658
That sounds much better.

42:54.692 --> 42:55.826
I'll catch you later.

42:55.860 --> 42:57.027
Bryce, I could push the
wedding back and that would

42:57.061 --> 42:58.863
give you more time to think
about it.

42:58.896 --> 42:59.697
Bye, Heather.

42:59.730 --> 43:01.566
Bryce, I'm pregnant.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.666
No, you're not.

43:02.700 --> 43:03.602
I could be!

43:03.634 --> 43:05.169
You don't know that I'm not.

43:06.605 --> 43:07.671
Bryce, come on.

43:07.705 --> 43:09.140
Don't give up on this.

43:09.173 --> 43:11.041
- Bryce? Bryce?
- I'm going to drive away.

43:11.075 --> 43:12.343
I am pregnant!

43:12.376 --> 43:13.310
I'm pregnant!

43:18.516 --> 43:20.284
You have no
messages.

43:36.066 --> 43:37.801
You have no messages.

43:52.149 --> 43:54.251
You still have no messages.

44:03.060 --> 44:04.495
Heather, my dear, I'm sorry
I'm late.

44:04.528 --> 44:06.096
I got caught in traffic,
but you are not

44:06.130 --> 44:09.266
going to believe the
surprise I have for you.

44:09.300 --> 44:11.735
Goodness. Are you okay?
You look terrible?

44:11.769 --> 44:13.871
Daddy, there's something
I need to tell you,

44:13.904 --> 44:15.072
for real this time.

44:15.105 --> 44:17.074
Okay, I'm there for
you. Whatever you need.

44:17.107 --> 44:18.442
Thanks, Daddy.

44:18.475 --> 44:21.245
Just say 'hi' to cousin
Nancy first!

44:22.813 --> 44:24.982
Hi, Nancy, it's great to see
you.

44:25.015 --> 44:27.318
It's great to see you, too,
Heather.

44:27.351 --> 44:29.220
My god, you haven't aged a bit.

44:29.253 --> 44:31.322
I just love your skin.
I'm so jealous.

44:31.355 --> 44:32.223
What do you use?

44:32.256 --> 44:33.824
Okay, bye, Nancy.

44:33.857 --> 44:35.893
Anyways, I'll tell you,
after these last few months

44:35.926 --> 44:38.829
I just need something happy
in my life like this wedding.

44:38.862 --> 44:40.030
Okay, I don't need to
hear where this is going.

44:40.064 --> 44:42.066
You won't believe it,
but, right after my second

44:42.099 --> 44:44.535
botched hip surgery, I
find out that Daniel's

44:44.569 --> 44:46.638
been sleeping with the hot
tramp behind the reception

44:46.671 --> 44:48.205
desk at his law firm.

44:48.239 --> 44:50.441
Of course, he and the harlot
are off in the Barbados

44:50.474 --> 44:52.711
right now while these
three little monsters

44:52.743 --> 44:54.511
are draining the life
out of me and I'm trying

44:54.545 --> 44:56.347
to figure out how to sue
the most successful attorney

44:56.380 --> 44:58.916
in Seattle for divorce
with my 21-year-old lawyer

44:58.949 --> 45:00.284
who lives with his parents and
just got

45:00.317 --> 45:01.620
his law degree online.

45:01.653 --> 45:04.021
And anyways the airline
lost my luggage and I also

45:04.054 --> 45:05.289
have Lyme disease!

45:05.322 --> 45:06.423
Okay.

45:06.457 --> 45:08.492
It's gonna be okay.
One, two, three, four,

45:08.525 --> 45:10.127
five, six, seven, eight, nine,
ten.

45:13.063 --> 45:16.133
Sweetheart, we can talk now.

45:16.166 --> 45:17.234
Dad.

45:17.268 --> 45:20.672
Oh, also, shouldn't
Bryce's family have arrived?

45:20.705 --> 45:23.007
I mean, I only see our family.

45:23.040 --> 45:25.542
That's what I wanted to
talk to you about. I, um...

45:28.713 --> 45:32.149
I just can't find them anywhere.

45:33.484 --> 45:35.687
Oh, gosh, really?

45:36.688 --> 45:38.122
Well, I don't think we
should do the rehearsal

45:38.155 --> 45:40.124
until Bryce's family arrives.

45:40.157 --> 45:42.793
You are right, so you know
what?

45:42.826 --> 45:44.995
I am going to go and find them.

45:45.029 --> 45:47.264
Yeah, I'll just go and I'll find
them.

45:47.298 --> 45:48.832
That's what I'm going to do.

45:48.866 --> 45:51.035
This is Bryce's cousin Reggie

45:52.503 --> 45:55.005
and this is Bryce's other cousin
Saul.

45:56.540 --> 45:59.577
- Hi.
- Oh, Christos, Christos.

45:59.611 --> 46:00.411
Sweetheart.

46:00.444 --> 46:01.979
Sal. Saul. Sal.

46:02.012 --> 46:03.782
Bryce's cousins are very dirty.

46:03.814 --> 46:07.284
Mm-hmm! Uh, they are
hippies. Bryce doesn't like

46:07.318 --> 46:08.620
to talk about them.

46:08.653 --> 46:09.820
Hi.

46:09.853 --> 46:10.821
- Oh, wow,
- Do you have a sandwich?

46:10.854 --> 46:12.791
How many winters have you
seen?

46:12.823 --> 46:15.859
Hey, "Hairy Friend" really
does look like a homeless guy.

46:17.861 --> 46:18.929
Heather, come here.

46:21.098 --> 46:21.932
Where's Bryce?

46:23.167 --> 46:27.004
Um, you know, Bryce called
me and, as always, he is stuck

46:27.037 --> 46:29.273
at work, but we can just have
someone else

46:29.306 --> 46:30.341
stand in for him.

46:30.374 --> 46:31.909
Who?

46:33.578 --> 46:35.079
Hi.

46:35.112 --> 46:36.313
"Hey,
you've reached Bryce Collins.

46:36.347 --> 46:37.481
Please leave me a message."

46:37.514 --> 46:39.651
Hi. It's me.

46:41.251 --> 46:45.022
I know this is stupid and beyond
crazy,

46:46.123 --> 46:49.293
but I might as well try.
I will be at our wedding

46:49.326 --> 46:52.429
tomorrow morning, and I hope
that maybe,

46:52.463 --> 46:55.399
just maybe, you have a
change of heart tonight

46:55.432 --> 46:56.266
and you come.

46:58.469 --> 47:00.270
And I wanted to say that you're
right.

47:00.304 --> 47:02.607
Things haven't been
good between us.

47:02.640 --> 47:04.208
A lot of that's my fault.

47:04.241 --> 47:06.210
I try to control things
too much, including you

47:06.243 --> 47:10.615
and me and our relationship,
and I need to fix that.

47:10.648 --> 47:12.349
I really hope to see you
tomorrow.

47:13.818 --> 47:14.652
Okay.

47:15.653 --> 47:16.487
I love you.

47:18.021 --> 47:19.022
Bye.

47:38.308 --> 47:40.812
Okay, sorry we're
late. Took me forever

47:40.845 --> 47:42.946
to kick the cute golf caddy out
of bed,

47:42.980 --> 47:44.682
and then I had to take an
important call.

47:44.716 --> 47:45.949
Seems like I might be nominated

47:45.983 --> 47:48.085
for a cabinet post or something.

47:48.118 --> 47:50.421
I think I'm the youngest ever
for the job.

47:50.454 --> 47:51.589
I don't know. Whatever.

47:51.623 --> 47:53.390
And I had to reply
to an email from Pandora.

47:53.424 --> 47:55.025
You know, you wouldn't guess it,

47:55.058 --> 47:56.927
but she's a fantastic writer.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.663
Wait. Where's Gretchen?

47:58.696 --> 47:59.631
How did we lose her?

47:59.664 --> 48:01.365
Heather, have you seen her?

48:02.266 --> 48:03.500
Morning,
girls.

48:05.737 --> 48:06.537
Wow.

48:08.305 --> 48:09.874
Look at my beautiful daughter.

48:11.843 --> 48:13.578
My dear, you look wonderful.

48:15.780 --> 48:17.981
Um, sweetheart.

48:20.184 --> 48:21.653
I haven't seen Bryce.

48:22.754 --> 48:24.121
The groom isn't supposed to see
the bride

48:24.154 --> 48:25.122
before the wedding.

48:26.023 --> 48:29.794
Honey, nobody's seen Bryce.

48:29.828 --> 48:31.295
He'll be here, Daddy.

48:45.409 --> 48:47.478
All right. We're missing a
bridesmaid,

48:47.511 --> 48:51.215
the groom is AWOL, and none
of his family have arrived.

48:51.248 --> 48:53.217
I think we've all gathered
the wedding isn't happening

48:53.250 --> 48:55.954
so I want you to be ready to
shift into freak-out mode,

48:55.986 --> 48:58.489
because I would not put it
past her to grab a crucifix

48:58.522 --> 49:00.390
and just start swingin'.

49:00.424 --> 49:01.893
Places!

49:15.773 --> 49:18.141
Well. On with it.

50:00.150 --> 50:01.653
Uh, sweetheart?

50:02.554 --> 50:03.487
Let's go.

50:04.521 --> 50:05.355
Yeah.

50:27.277 --> 50:28.545
Hey, where's Rice?

50:30.014 --> 50:30.982
Who?

51:02.680 --> 51:05.583
Ms. Papadopoulos, is
something supposed to happen?

51:05.617 --> 51:06.416
Read it.

51:06.450 --> 51:07.284
Excuse me?

51:07.317 --> 51:08.185
Wait for it.

51:08.218 --> 51:09.687
Read it.

51:09.721 --> 51:10.555
Heather.

51:11.421 --> 51:12.724
I don't think he's coming.

51:13.825 --> 51:16.661
- Read it!
- Ah!

51:16.694 --> 51:19.262
How does that hurt so much?

51:23.701 --> 51:27.237
We are gathered here today,

51:27.270 --> 51:29.439
in the sight of God

51:29.473 --> 51:33.077
and in the face of family
and friends, to join together

51:33.111 --> 51:35.278
Heather Papadopoulos

51:36.513 --> 51:38.415
and Bryce Collins?

51:40.785 --> 51:42.219
In holy matrimony?

51:46.024 --> 51:47.524
All right. Stop.

51:47.558 --> 51:49.192
He's not coming.

51:49.226 --> 51:50.862
It's on! Brace yourselves!

51:53.031 --> 51:54.498
Why won't the door open?

51:54.531 --> 51:57.935
I think it's locked. Should I
open it?

51:59.904 --> 52:02.439
It's him! It's him!

52:11.883 --> 52:12.717
What?

52:12.750 --> 52:14.351
I thought it'd look good for the
wedding.

52:14.384 --> 52:15.853
It's not a disguise!

52:16.921 --> 52:18.856
Hey, where's Bryce?

52:41.579 --> 52:43.246
Heather!

52:43.280 --> 52:44.816
- Heather!
- Heather!

52:44.849 --> 52:47.118
- Heather.
- Where are you?

52:47.151 --> 52:48.953
- Heather!
- Heather!

52:48.986 --> 52:50.487
Heather!

53:05.136 --> 53:07.337
Sweetheart, there you are.

53:07.370 --> 53:09.006
We've been looking
all over for you.

53:15.479 --> 53:16.346
You okay?

53:18.515 --> 53:19.349
Not really.

53:21.418 --> 53:23.554
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

53:23.588 --> 53:25.355
Daddy, I'm so sorry.

53:25.388 --> 53:28.226
I wasted all your money.
Do you hate me?

53:28.258 --> 53:30.427
What kind of a question is
that?

53:30.460 --> 53:31.629
Of course not.

53:32.630 --> 53:36.333
One day you'll look back
on all this and laugh.

53:36.366 --> 53:38.468
Hey, I'm surprised you made
it this far. I wasn't really

53:38.502 --> 53:41.205
planning on paying for
any wedding anytime soon.

53:41.239 --> 53:42.573
What do you mean?

53:42.607 --> 53:44.776
Sweetheart, I don't
mean that in a bad way.

53:44.809 --> 53:46.778
You're a strong-willed person,

53:48.179 --> 53:50.480
which you've been ever
since your mother died.

53:51.816 --> 53:53.985
You're just like her actually.

53:54.018 --> 53:56.386
That smile in her wedding photos

53:57.855 --> 54:00.258
is the smile of a woman
who knew what she wanted

54:01.692 --> 54:02.627
and made it happen.

54:05.997 --> 54:07.464
I want to give you something.

54:09.366 --> 54:10.568
What is this?

54:10.601 --> 54:14.272
I was told to give you this
the day after your wedding,

54:14.304 --> 54:16.007
so I guess I'm breaking the
rules,

54:17.241 --> 54:19.043
but something tells me it's
okay.

54:22.580 --> 54:25.049
Dear
Heather, as I write this letter

54:25.082 --> 54:28.252
I'm watching you play on the
tire swing in our backyard.

54:28.286 --> 54:30.453
I know how much you've always
loved to look at my wedding

54:30.487 --> 54:34.324
album, so, as you read this
letter, I'm sure you're basking

54:34.357 --> 54:37.527
in the afterglow
of your perfect day.

54:37.562 --> 54:40.397
But, now that you've pulled
off your perfect wedding,

54:40.430 --> 54:44.035
I want you to know something.
It doesn't matter.

54:44.068 --> 54:48.272
The flowers, the decorations,
the food. None of it matters.

54:48.306 --> 54:51.441
Because your life is already
perfect.

54:51.474 --> 54:54.511
You'll worry about so many
little things from day to day.

54:54.544 --> 54:58.381
Money, career, deadlines.
But you must remember to live

54:58.415 --> 55:02.119
every moment of your life,
because it can go away

55:02.153 --> 55:03.788
at any time.

55:03.821 --> 55:06.523
So I want you to put
down this letter and hold

55:06.557 --> 55:11.662
the person you love, because
your life is already perfect.

55:11.696 --> 55:15.132
I love you very much. Your
Mother.

55:23.307 --> 55:25.743
Everyone, I want to thank
you all for coming here,

55:25.776 --> 55:28.079
some of you from very,
very far away.

55:28.112 --> 55:30.281
I'm sorry the wedding
didn't happen this morning,

55:30.314 --> 55:32.583
but I'm glad I
got to see all of you.

55:32.617 --> 55:36.419
I didn't need to pay
$2,000 just to see your face.

55:36.453 --> 55:38.488
I could have logged into the
Faceweb.

55:38.521 --> 55:40.858
That's kind of anti-my
point, but I'm sure deep down

55:40.892 --> 55:42.459
you don't really mean that,
Grandpa.

55:42.492 --> 55:43.895
No, I do.

55:45.796 --> 55:48.099
And Great-Grandmother
Adonia, I didn't even stop

55:48.132 --> 55:50.334
to think how lucky
I am to see you.

55:50.368 --> 55:53.271
Not many people have
great-grandmothers, but I do.

55:53.304 --> 55:56.406
Heather? When is the wedding?

55:57.708 --> 56:00.443
Sorry, baby,
she was doing so well.

56:02.079 --> 56:06.217
I have a wonderful family.
Thank you all for being here.

56:07.151 --> 56:09.220
Thank you, Ms. Papadopoulos.

56:09.253 --> 56:10.087
Aw.

56:17.862 --> 56:18.696
What?

56:21.699 --> 56:22.934
What's this?

56:22.967 --> 56:24.135
It's for the wedding.

56:26.971 --> 56:28.306
I can't accept this.

56:28.339 --> 56:29.173
I insist.

56:30.308 --> 56:32.576
This is probably all
you have in the world.

56:32.610 --> 56:34.612
I have everything I need,
Daddy.

56:46.489 --> 56:48.793
Thank, Christ.

56:51.929 --> 56:53.731
We're so sorry, Heather.

56:53.764 --> 56:56.499
I'm sorry I said things
would end up in the toilet,

56:56.533 --> 56:57.668
even though I was right.

56:57.702 --> 57:00.271
I'm sorry I slept with,
like, half the hotel staff.

57:00.304 --> 57:02.173
I've just been stressed about my
upcoming

57:02.206 --> 57:03.808
Senate confirmation hearings.

57:03.841 --> 57:06.610
And I'm guilty... sorry, too!

57:06.644 --> 57:08.379
Do you hate us?

57:08.412 --> 57:09.680
Why would I hate you?

57:09.714 --> 57:11.882
Because we started this whole
mess.

57:11.916 --> 57:14.185
No, no, listen, you
didn't start this mess.

57:14.218 --> 57:16.454
It was a long time
coming. Probably better

57:16.486 --> 57:18.656
to find out now than later.

57:18.689 --> 57:23.694
Besides, you're my friends.
Apparently, my only friends.

57:28.165 --> 57:29.633
We really are, aren't we?

57:31.669 --> 57:33.471
I'll catch up
with everyone later, Daddy.

57:33.503 --> 57:35.740
There's one more person
I need to apologize to.

57:35.773 --> 57:38.541
I hope
it's that Rodriguez girl.

57:38.576 --> 57:41.712
Yes, it's the
Rodriguez girl. God, I get it.

57:41.746 --> 57:43.247
I ruined her wedding.

57:43.280 --> 57:44.615
Do we have enough chairs,
Jenny?

57:44.648 --> 57:45.983
I'll go check the other
closet.

57:46.017 --> 57:47.218
Hold on. I can help.

57:47.251 --> 57:48.886
Me, too. Once I'm done with
this.

57:48.919 --> 57:50.187
Oh, Mama, there's still so
many things

57:50.221 --> 57:51.822
to take care of before tomorrow.

57:51.856 --> 57:55.192
Relax, Maria. Everything
is going to be beautiful.

57:55.226 --> 57:58.262
Nothing is going to mess
with my daughter's happy day.

57:58.295 --> 58:01.932
It is a time for love and
kindness.

58:03.934 --> 58:05.603
What the hell are you doing
here,

58:07.071 --> 58:08.272
Uh, I came to speak to Maria.

58:08.305 --> 58:09.974
No. Go.

58:10.007 --> 58:12.476
Leave. You've done enough
already.

58:12.510 --> 58:13.811
- Mama.
- It'll just take one moment.

58:13.844 --> 58:16.781
No. You go now. Go!

58:16.814 --> 58:18.783
- Go!
- Okay, okay.

58:18.816 --> 58:20.117
You wanted to speak to me?

58:20.151 --> 58:23.788
I wanted to apologize.
For stealing your dress.

58:24.855 --> 58:27.491
And your flowers. And
basically half of your wedding

58:27.525 --> 58:28.859
from right underneath you.

58:28.893 --> 58:31.195
And, uh, I wanted to see if
I could help with anything.

58:31.228 --> 58:33.130
You know, I actually do this
kind of thing for a living.

58:33.164 --> 58:36.400
Oh? You ruin people's
hopes and dreams for a living?

58:36.434 --> 58:38.769
Listen here, amiga.

58:39.804 --> 58:42.173
I will end you.

58:42.206 --> 58:44.742
I am not kidding. I have cut
people.

58:44.775 --> 58:47.645
I have killed rabid
dogs with my own teeth.

58:47.678 --> 58:51.215
I have fought my way out of
South American prison riots.

58:51.248 --> 58:54.185
You do not want to mess with me.

58:54.218 --> 58:55.719
And I will do anything,

58:56.754 --> 59:00.458
anything, to see to it
that you come nowhere near

59:00.491 --> 59:03.527
our holy event, so help me God!

59:08.099 --> 59:10.234
I'll bet you're a bad
event planner anyway.

59:12.937 --> 59:14.839
Excuse me?

59:17.842 --> 59:19.877
A big meeting?
At 20:00 hours?

59:19.910 --> 59:21.479
What is she talking about?

59:21.512 --> 59:23.781
Beats me. Her wedding
was a bust. Shouldn't we be

59:23.814 --> 59:26.383
striking everything for the
tenth time?

59:27.618 --> 59:29.353
Yeah, I hate her, too.

59:29.386 --> 59:30.921
Good. Our final two troops
are here.

59:30.955 --> 59:32.089
Please sit, gentlemen.

59:33.257 --> 59:35.693
Now as you all know my
wedding this morning

59:35.726 --> 59:37.228
did not work out.

59:37.261 --> 59:38.295
Big surprise.

59:38.329 --> 59:40.064
'Big surprise,' I'm sure
many of you are saying,

59:40.097 --> 59:43.602
for which I would normally
fire you, but not today.

59:43.634 --> 59:46.170
Today, my social soirée
soldiers, we have another

59:46.203 --> 59:47.171
wedding to save.

59:47.204 --> 59:50.341
The wedding of a kind,
sweet girl named Maria.

59:50.374 --> 59:52.009
Per your contracts, I have
you all through the end

59:52.042 --> 59:54.912
of the evening and I intend to
use you.

59:54.945 --> 59:57.781
We are an army now.
You are all participants

59:57.815 --> 59:59.950
in Operation Wedding Surprise
"colon"

59:59.984 --> 01:00:02.987
Nobody Calls Me a Bad Event
Planner, You Dizzy Old Hag.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:05.890
Now our enemy, Maria's
mother, has resisted

01:00:05.923 --> 01:00:08.959
initial invasion, so our
mission will be a covert one.

01:00:08.993 --> 01:00:10.629
Under the shroud of
night we will infiltrate

01:00:10.661 --> 01:00:12.997
enemy territory and
deliver our salvos of class

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:15.232
and elegance upon our
unsuspecting victims.

01:00:15.266 --> 01:00:17.902
Now there's a lot to
review, so listen closely.

01:00:17.935 --> 01:00:19.170
First!

01:00:34.586 --> 01:00:36.320
Ah!

01:00:36.353 --> 01:00:37.821
What are you doing here?

01:00:37.855 --> 01:00:40.457
What the hell is going on?

01:00:40.491 --> 01:00:42.126
State your business.

01:00:42.159 --> 01:00:44.895
Take that knife away
from my throat, Heather.

01:00:47.398 --> 01:00:50.401
Jesus Christ, Heather!

01:00:50.434 --> 01:00:52.836
I came here to talk to you
while I thought you'd be

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.238
taking everything down.

01:00:54.271 --> 01:00:56.907
Duly noted and appreciated,
but there's no time

01:00:56.941 --> 01:00:59.243
to talk, Bryce. Clock's a
tickin'!

01:00:59.276 --> 01:01:00.177
What's going on?

01:01:00.211 --> 01:01:01.845
We're rescuing the Rodriguez
wedding.

01:01:01.879 --> 01:01:03.314
Why? What happened to it?

01:01:03.347 --> 01:01:04.381
I happened to it.

01:01:05.816 --> 01:01:07.051
Is that the hotel's china?

01:01:07.084 --> 01:01:08.319
It's much nicer than Maria's.

01:01:08.352 --> 01:01:09.386
So you're just
going to steal it?

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:11.021
It's not stealing if
you return it afterwards.

01:01:11.055 --> 01:01:13.123
That is not true at all.

01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:15.159
- Hey, is that Spice?
- No, no, no. Rice.

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:18.729
Okay, I came here to apologize
to you

01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:20.497
for walking out on
you the other day

01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:22.199
and leaving you to deal
with this whole mess.

01:01:22.233 --> 01:01:23.734
I shouldn't have done that.

01:01:23.767 --> 01:01:24.768
I'm sorry.

01:01:26.237 --> 01:01:28.138
And you were right. I
guess I've got some things

01:01:28.172 --> 01:01:29.773
I have to work on myself.

01:01:31.008 --> 01:01:32.743
But I guess it doesn't
matter, because you've clearly

01:01:32.776 --> 01:01:33.978
- gone off the deep end.
- Cover!

01:01:38.449 --> 01:01:41.819
'Sup, hotel worker guy?

01:01:41.852 --> 01:01:43.020
I'm taking a smoke break.

01:01:43.053 --> 01:01:44.021
What?

01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:46.390
Tell him, 'I'm taking a smoke
break.'

01:01:48.859 --> 01:01:50.861
I'm taking a smoke break.

01:01:50.894 --> 01:01:51.730
Okay.

01:01:56.668 --> 01:01:59.671
It's good.

01:02:02.906 --> 01:02:03.841
I love cigarettes.

01:02:06.611 --> 01:02:08.078
I'm trying to quit.

01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:09.380
Don't.

01:02:12.016 --> 01:02:15.352
I will help you! No,
you don't need to throw

01:02:15.386 --> 01:02:17.254
that in. I will help you.

01:02:17.288 --> 01:02:18.088
Thanks.

01:02:18.122 --> 01:02:21.158
And you? Don't give up.

01:02:22.159 --> 01:02:22.993
Thank you.

01:02:27.064 --> 01:02:28.866
Next time don't say
anything I don't tell

01:02:28.899 --> 01:02:29.833
you to say, got it?

01:02:29.867 --> 01:02:30.901
Oh, got it, 'cause guess what?

01:02:30.934 --> 01:02:32.069
There's not going to be a next
time.

01:02:32.102 --> 01:02:33.437
Okay, Bryce, have it your way.

01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:35.039
Yeah, I will have it
my way, because my way

01:02:35.072 --> 01:02:37.074
doesn't involve stealing
everything from the hotel

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:38.677
and cigarettes. I hate
cigarettes!

01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:39.644
Me, too!

01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:40.844
I did that for you, Bryce!

01:02:40.878 --> 01:02:42.212
Why do you even have
cigarettes?

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.148
I should have never come here.

01:02:44.181 --> 01:02:45.182
I thought you were leaving.

01:02:45.215 --> 01:02:47.117
Yeah, I am.
My car's right here.

01:02:47.151 --> 01:02:48.787
Ugh.

01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:49.654
See you later.

01:02:55.627 --> 01:02:57.127
If you change your mind
the Rodriguez wedding

01:02:57.161 --> 01:02:59.229
is at the Shoreline Clubhouse on
Moreno.

01:03:22.386 --> 01:03:23.555
It's locked.

01:03:26.591 --> 01:03:27.659
You can pick locks?

01:03:27.692 --> 01:03:29.794
Event Planning 101,
Cindy.

01:03:29.828 --> 01:03:30.994
Nice technique.

01:03:31.028 --> 01:03:32.262
Hmm.

01:03:32.296 --> 01:03:34.733
What? I get locked out
of my apartment a lot.

01:03:37.534 --> 01:03:38.535
Let's get to work.

01:03:39.738 --> 01:03:41.806
All right. The first
thing we want to do is...

01:03:43.173 --> 01:03:45.075
Oh, god, I hate that woman.

01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:46.678
What is she doing here?

01:03:46.711 --> 01:03:48.345
- Guarding.
- From what?

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:50.481
- From me.
- What is she holding?

01:03:50.514 --> 01:03:51.982
Maria's wedding dress.

01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:53.150
Should we retreat?

01:03:53.183 --> 01:03:55.452
No, listen up,
troops. Mission adjustment.

01:03:55.486 --> 01:03:59.624
First, we move Maria's
mother. Then, we redecorate.

01:03:59.657 --> 01:04:03.661
Tread lightly. We do not
want to wake that woman.

01:04:03.695 --> 01:04:06.798
She's like me, but worse.

01:04:23.681 --> 01:04:25.916
All right, everyone.
Let's move.

01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.752
Strike these polyester pieces of
garbage.

01:04:27.786 --> 01:04:30.521
I want 500 thread count Bavarian
cotton napkins, Theresa.

01:04:30.555 --> 01:04:32.990
What are these plastic
monstrosities?

01:04:33.023 --> 01:04:35.192
Get me Venetian ballroom fours,
Cheryl.

01:04:35.225 --> 01:04:37.662
The ceiling lacks ambience.
I want Chinese lanterns

01:04:37.695 --> 01:04:39.396
set at a default dimmer level
eight.

01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:40.264
Two.

01:04:42.466 --> 01:04:43.568
I beg your pardon?

01:04:43.601 --> 01:04:45.969
Default dimmer level at
two. You've got the same

01:04:46.003 --> 01:04:47.371
number of lanterns you
had for the ballroom,

01:04:47.404 --> 01:04:48.972
but this room is a quarter of
the size.

01:04:49.006 --> 01:04:50.842
Default dimmer level at two.

01:04:51.676 --> 01:04:55.045
How would you know anything
about default dimmer levels?

01:04:56.113 --> 01:04:57.481
Sometimes boyfriends
listen to the things

01:04:57.514 --> 01:04:58.449
their girlfriends talk about

01:04:58.482 --> 01:05:00.050
more than their girlfriends
realize, sir!

01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:08.025
Default dimmer level set at
two, please.

01:05:11.295 --> 01:05:13.063
Welcome to the shit.

01:05:13.096 --> 01:05:14.398
Hooah.

01:05:40.859 --> 01:05:44.762
Wait, wait, wait. So you've
fallen three stories before?

01:05:44.796 --> 01:05:46.698
Yes, hanging banners at
events.

01:05:46.731 --> 01:05:48.131
How are you still alive?

01:05:48.165 --> 01:05:50.100
You just relax your body
before you hit the ground,

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:51.435
like a baby falling from heaven.

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:53.337
That is Event Planning 201,
Bryce.

01:05:53.370 --> 01:05:55.673
Gary, gather the troops
so I can dismiss them.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:58.041
We're done here?

01:05:58.075 --> 01:05:59.443
Not quite.

01:05:59.476 --> 01:06:00.511
Why not just
leave the dress on one

01:06:00.544 --> 01:06:01.946
of the tables or something?

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.582
Because Maria's mother will
throw it away out of spite.

01:06:04.616 --> 01:06:06.985
We have to kidnap Maria's other
dress so she has no choice

01:06:07.017 --> 01:06:08.318
but to wear this one.

01:06:08.352 --> 01:06:10.320
How do you know she'll
like yours better?

01:06:10.354 --> 01:06:12.356
I stole it from her.

01:06:12.389 --> 01:06:14.324
I thought you outbid?

01:07:02.272 --> 01:07:03.708
El Diablo!

01:07:13.083 --> 01:07:13.918
Wow.

01:07:15.185 --> 01:07:16.821
You were right.

01:07:16.854 --> 01:07:19.691
Relaxing before you hit the
ground really does help.

01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:20.558
See?

01:07:24.963 --> 01:07:27.999
Hey, so, um, great work,
Heather.

01:07:28.032 --> 01:07:29.499
It really does look better in
there.

01:07:29.533 --> 01:07:31.936
I'm not done yet. I
need to fix up the church.

01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:34.504
Right.

01:07:34.538 --> 01:07:36.641
Do you want to come?

01:07:45.783 --> 01:07:47.085
It's nice.

01:07:47.117 --> 01:07:50.153
It is. It
just needs some accents.

01:07:50.187 --> 01:07:51.421
Flowers?

01:07:51.455 --> 01:07:52.389
Flowers.

01:07:53.992 --> 01:07:55.093
Hey, Heather?

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:55.960
Yeah?

01:07:57.361 --> 01:08:00.364
The sex wasn't bad.
It was good.

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:07.105
I just wish that you didn't
plan it. That's all.

01:08:07.404 --> 01:08:09.107
Well, you know, I have a
really busy schedule to work

01:08:09.139 --> 01:08:10.808
around so it makes sense
to find nights that...

01:08:10.842 --> 01:08:13.845
No, no, no. I mean
what we actually do, like,

01:08:13.878 --> 01:08:15.178
positions and stuff.

01:08:16.145 --> 01:08:18.983
You literally made an itinerary
once.

01:08:19.017 --> 01:08:20.317
For our first anniversary.

01:08:24.453 --> 01:08:26.557
Maybe I can be more
spontaneous.

01:08:27.424 --> 01:08:28.358
Just a bit.

01:08:29.894 --> 01:08:31.461
We shouldn't talk about
this in front of the church.

01:08:31.495 --> 01:08:32.496
Come on.

01:08:32.529 --> 01:08:33.363
Right.

01:08:34.231 --> 01:08:35.700
That first
anniversary was

01:08:35.733 --> 01:08:37.167
pretty dynamite though.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.435
Solid itinerary.

01:08:40.237 --> 01:08:41.203
Not bad.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.428
Hello? Is someone there?

01:09:09.634 --> 01:09:10.466
Huh.

01:09:28.086 --> 01:09:29.153
Really push it.

01:09:29.187 --> 01:09:30.587
I am really pushing.

01:09:32.322 --> 01:09:33.858
All right. I'm going to call
for help.

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:34.759
Help!

01:09:37.795 --> 01:09:40.263
Do you want to
get me arrested again?

01:09:40.296 --> 01:09:42.734
He's a priest. We'll
just tell him the truth.

01:09:42.767 --> 01:09:44.836
Priests are all about
forgiveness, right?

01:09:48.973 --> 01:09:49.774
Help!

01:09:51.676 --> 01:09:53.510
- Help!
- Help!

01:09:53.542 --> 01:09:55.747
Please! Help us!

01:09:59.150 --> 01:10:01.552
I think we're
stuck here for a while.

01:10:03.554 --> 01:10:05.255
We're going to get tired soon.

01:10:07.158 --> 01:10:09.193
Put your head on my chest.

01:10:09.227 --> 01:10:10.260
What?

01:10:10.293 --> 01:10:13.363
You can put your head
on my chest. Go to sleep.

01:10:13.396 --> 01:10:14.232
I'll hold you.

01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.108
Thanks for your help today.

01:10:24.142 --> 01:10:25.308
Yeah.

01:10:25.342 --> 01:10:27.612
It was... it was fun.

01:10:30.615 --> 01:10:32.083
It was fun, wasn't it?

01:10:33.985 --> 01:10:37.088
Hey, um, when we were
in France and you toured

01:10:37.121 --> 01:10:41.592
the Louvre, what was
your favorite painting?

01:10:41.626 --> 01:10:43.628
The Mona Lisa, of course.

01:10:43.661 --> 01:10:44.762
Why?

01:10:44.796 --> 01:10:46.264
Because she's complex.

01:10:51.836 --> 01:10:53.137
Goodnight, Bryce.

01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:54.939
Goodnight, Heather.

01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:15.293
Maria!

01:11:15.325 --> 01:11:17.995
Mama, where have you been?
I called you a million times.

01:11:18.029 --> 01:11:18.863
Look.

01:11:25.970 --> 01:11:27.504
Oh my God.

01:11:27.537 --> 01:11:28.739
Come. Look.

01:11:32.677 --> 01:11:33.911
It's wonderful.

01:11:33.945 --> 01:11:35.179
And that's not all.

01:11:35.213 --> 01:11:37.682
The reception is beautiful, too.

01:11:39.016 --> 01:11:43.621
Maria, do you know who
made this miracle happen?

01:12:52.723 --> 01:12:55.293
We are gathered here today
to celebrate the union...

01:12:57.762 --> 01:12:58.562
Where am I?

01:12:58.596 --> 01:12:59.397
Where am I?!

01:13:00.598 --> 01:13:01.699
Be quiet!

01:13:03.034 --> 01:13:04.135
Be quiet! Be quiet!

01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:14.345
Oh, right.

01:13:15.813 --> 01:13:17.315
Sorry.

01:13:17.348 --> 01:13:19.150
No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:22.186 --> 01:13:25.690
I am so sorry, Maria. I
wanted to make it better.

01:13:25.723 --> 01:13:27.457
I've been horrible to you.

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:28.693
To everyone.

01:13:28.726 --> 01:13:31.128
I wanted to be a better person,

01:13:31.162 --> 01:13:32.964
to be a good person.

01:13:32.997 --> 01:13:34.732
And now look what I've done.

01:13:34.765 --> 01:13:35.833
Oh my God.

01:13:37.467 --> 01:13:38.703
I'm so sorry.

01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:44.775
Thank you.

01:13:44.809 --> 01:13:46.043
I just ruined your wedding.

01:13:46.077 --> 01:13:48.312
No, you didn't. You made it
perfect.

01:13:49.447 --> 01:13:51.248
Everyone, this is Heather.

01:13:51.282 --> 01:13:53.217
She's responsible
for all of this.

01:14:01.025 --> 01:14:02.226
Richard?

01:14:02.259 --> 01:14:03.728
What are you doing here?

01:14:03.761 --> 01:14:05.062
He's my older brother.

01:14:05.096 --> 01:14:06.964
Oh, I didn't realize.

01:14:07.999 --> 01:14:10.301
That's where all my roses went.

01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:13.938
I promise to love you and
cherish you

01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:16.207
for the rest of our lives.

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.043
Maria Rodriguez
and Antonio Sanchez,

01:14:19.076 --> 01:14:20.945
today is the day that you have
chosen

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:23.214
to become husband and wife.

01:14:23.247 --> 01:14:25.583
We are here not only to
witness the commitment

01:14:25.616 --> 01:14:28.386
that you are making to
each other, but also

01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:31.521
to wish you every happiness
in your future life together.

01:14:41.599 --> 01:14:46.237
So through the power vested
in me, I now pronounce you

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:47.738
husband

01:14:47.772 --> 01:14:49.073
and wife.

01:14:49.106 --> 01:14:50.274
You may kiss the bride.

01:15:34.652 --> 01:15:35.453
Good work, Heather.

01:15:35.486 --> 01:15:37.288
Paul, what are you doing here?

01:15:37.321 --> 01:15:38.856
Hey, I had a part in
this. I should at least

01:15:38.889 --> 01:15:40.091
get some free food out of it.

01:15:42.827 --> 01:15:44.662
Also, some good news.
I found someone.

01:15:47.298 --> 01:15:49.100
Thank you so much for
letting us be a part of this,

01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:50.434
Rice and Heather.

01:15:50.468 --> 01:15:54.171
No, wait. Heather and Rice.
That sounds much better.

01:15:57.842 --> 01:15:59.977
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:16:01.946 --> 01:16:03.347
She looks so happy.

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.815
Mm-hmm.

01:16:04.849 --> 01:16:06.851
I like making people happy.

01:16:06.884 --> 01:16:08.319
I should do it more often.

01:16:08.352 --> 01:16:10.488
Heather! A picture!

01:16:10.521 --> 01:16:12.256
Oh, no, no, no. I'm fine.

01:16:12.289 --> 01:16:13.324
- Yes.
- No, no.

01:16:13.357 --> 01:16:16.527
Yes. You, me, and my family.

01:16:16.561 --> 01:16:17.661
No.

01:16:24.468 --> 01:16:26.403
Wait. We need your father.

01:16:26.437 --> 01:16:28.372
I'm missing my father today,

01:16:28.405 --> 01:16:30.274
but I know he's here with us.

01:16:33.043 --> 01:16:35.179
Okay. Smile, everybody.

01:16:35.212 --> 01:16:38.916
Ready?
One, two, three, cheese!

01:16:39.783 --> 01:16:40.651
Yay!

01:16:41.519 --> 01:16:42.319
You look beautiful.

01:16:42.353 --> 01:16:43.354
Thank you.

01:16:50.294 --> 01:16:53.030
So what are you up to now?

01:16:54.999 --> 01:16:56.667
I was thinking about hanging
out a bit.

01:16:58.269 --> 01:16:59.103
You?

01:17:00.504 --> 01:17:02.574
I was going to dance a little.

01:17:05.109 --> 01:17:08.245
Heather, will you
dance with me?

01:17:09.513 --> 01:17:10.548
Heather!

01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:13.250
Okay, I can't hide it
anymore. I need your help.

01:17:13.284 --> 01:17:16.020
I accidentally killed
a male hooker last week

01:17:16.053 --> 01:17:18.189
and things got out of hand
and I dumped him in a river

01:17:18.222 --> 01:17:20.491
in Litchfield County and
the cops finally found me

01:17:20.524 --> 01:17:22.960
and they're outside and
I need a place to hide.

01:17:32.637 --> 01:17:35.472
On April 5th,
2019, Maria Rodriguez

01:17:35.506 --> 01:17:37.474
married Antonio Sanchez.

01:17:37.508 --> 01:17:40.477
Maria was 26 and Antonio
was 28 when Antonio

01:17:40.511 --> 01:17:42.581
asked for her hand in marriage.

01:17:42.614 --> 01:17:44.583
Their relatives traveled
from around the globe

01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:45.883
for the happy occasion.

01:17:45.916 --> 01:17:48.986
The weather was pristine,
the groom was handsome,

01:17:49.019 --> 01:17:52.456
the bride was beautiful, and
Maria's smile

01:17:52.489 --> 01:17:54.124
was the centerpiece of it all.

01:17:54.158 --> 01:17:56.293
It was her dream wedding.

01:17:56.327 --> 01:17:59.263
Now just wait until you see my
wedding.

01:17:59.296 --> 01:18:00.331
Ready, Bryce?

01:18:00.364 --> 01:18:01.165
Hooah!

01:19:46.036 --> 01:19:47.572
Tell him the
honeymoon fell through

01:19:47.605 --> 01:19:49.506
and you have
to stay in a Motel 6.

01:19:49.540 --> 01:19:50.841
Tell him you're
knocked up.

01:19:50.874 --> 01:19:52.644
Tell him you
were born with a dick.

01:19:52.677 --> 01:19:54.378
Nobody likes a
surprise dick.

01:19:54.411 --> 01:19:57.481
Don't worry,
girls. I've got a great one.

01:20:48.069 --> 01:20:51.312
