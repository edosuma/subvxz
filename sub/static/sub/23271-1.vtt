01:58.327 --> 01:59.912
<i>Love does not exist.</i>

02:01.831 --> 02:03.499
<i>There is no such thing.</i>

02:06.335 --> 02:08.712
<i>Therefore, there is no sadness.</i>

02:11.173 --> 02:12.883
<i>That is what I thought.</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:00.014
<i>Are you okay?</i>

03:17.948 --> 03:19.909
It's going to die.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.660
No! Don't!

03:21.785 --> 03:23.913
It's gonna die. Give it to me.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.414
No!

03:25.873 --> 03:26.957
Let me kill it.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.334
No, you can't!

03:28.876 --> 03:31.212
Why the hell not!?

03:33.797 --> 03:36.175
<i>People despised me.</i>

03:36.634 --> 03:38.510
<i>And you were a crybaby.</i>

03:39.511 --> 03:42.306
AKIRA

03:49.188 --> 03:52.441
Why are you crying?
You knew it was gonna die.

03:52.900 --> 03:53.776
No.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.028
The weak ones die.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.239
No. That's not true.

03:58.364 --> 04:00.449
You're crying, too, Ryo.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.536
Why? I'm not sad. It was gonna die.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.747
You're crying, too, Ryo.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.583
<i>At the time...</i>

04:10.084 --> 04:12.711
<i>I didn't know what you meant.</i>

04:13.337 --> 04:14.296
10 YEARS LATER

04:22.805 --> 04:25.224
Akira, I need you right now.

04:25.349 --> 04:28.227
I Need You

04:28.560 --> 04:30.688
On your mark.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.732
Get set.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.832
- Miko's boobs are bouncing like crazy.
- You pervert.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.961
So fast! Just what you'd expect
of Kamioka Academy's witch.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.922
She might be doping.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.758
I don't wanna run with our school's girls.

05:00.259 --> 05:02.886
Why's that guy doing track-and-field?

05:03.345 --> 05:05.389
He's staying at Miki's place.

05:05.681 --> 05:09.101
- Maybe he wants to go home with her.
- Hide your phone.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.728
It's fine.

05:10.853 --> 05:13.022
Coach is senile.
Forget about my phone.

05:13.147 --> 05:15.399
It's that super high-schooler.

05:15.524 --> 05:19.445
- Miki, you're amazing. You're so fast.
- You were fast, too, Miko.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.949
MOYURU KODA JUNICHI KOTOBA
What a bizarre murder.
It's all over the news.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.911
TEAMMATE MURDERED

05:28.037 --> 05:30.706
MOYURU KODA
You've been teammates for years, right?

05:30.831 --> 05:34.209
There's a rumor you two went
to a questionable party.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.128
A drug party?

05:36.253 --> 05:40.966
Word is they went to some
pseudo-Satanic party called Sabbath.

05:41.091 --> 05:44.636
I'd sign a deal with the Devil
if it'd make me run faster.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.555
Wasn't the guy who died fast, too?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.977
What...? Why?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.729
He's crying.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.647
That person is crying.

05:55.773 --> 05:59.151
Akira's crying again.
Was someone sad?

06:01.403 --> 06:03.572
Ah, the super high-schooler.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.158
I'd cry, too, if my friend died.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.370
But this guy isn't crying, is he?

06:09.495 --> 06:12.331
Why are you crying?

06:12.456 --> 06:16.251
Oh, hey. Let's do a 4-by-100-meter relay.
A mixed relay.

06:16.377 --> 06:20.089
- There's supposed to be an event, right?
- Seriously?

06:20.214 --> 06:24.218
Isn't it a memorial service?
Wonder what happens because of this case.

06:24.968 --> 06:29.848
You seem concerned, but what you
really want is to run 4-by-100, right?

06:31.141 --> 06:33.143
It's Mr. Nagasaki.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.479
Sorry, gotta go.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.194
Are you busy?

06:42.319 --> 06:46.490
I just finished an interview and
was wondering if you're hungry.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.992
There's an Italian place
that's hard to set into.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.995
I got lucky and got a table.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.664
THE TRACK WITCH

06:53.664 --> 06:55.958
- The guy taking photos of Miki?
- Probably her boyfriend.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.506
- Fans across the county are bummed.
- She's out of your league, guys.

07:03.173 --> 07:05.968
Miki is a star, after all.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.682
Don't look like you're gonna cry.
How could you refuse to speak?

07:11.807 --> 07:14.977
Things would've calmed down
if you looked upset.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.020
The Asian Games are coming up.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.190
You're suspected of doping,
so, prove your record

07:20.315 --> 07:22.943
in the game coming up.
For an idiot like you...

07:31.243 --> 07:32.995
There you are.

07:34.621 --> 07:36.999
Akira,
have my parents buy you a phone.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.334
You shouldn't feel hesitant with them.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.712
I wouldn't really use it.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.423
You can text all your
class and teammates.

07:44.548 --> 07:46.300
And clear the history after you watch porn

07:46.425 --> 07:50.012
- on the living room computer.
- The living room?!

07:50.137 --> 07:53.056
I gotta do something.
I'll take the back way.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.517
Even in a car, It's dangerous downtown,

07:55.642 --> 07:59.938
- so, be careful.
- I won't be home late.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.357
Bye.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.943
Fudo, we should...

08:09.198 --> 08:12.618
It's popular among the young people
in high society.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.246
They say it fills you with
energy and willpower.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.833
There are stories that people change,
or go missing...

08:19.833 --> 08:21.627
MIKI:
I'M SORRY.

08:21.627 --> 08:22.711
Oh, I have to go. Goodbye.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.130
MIKI: IMPROMPTU PLANS FOR TRACK.
HAVE FUN.

08:39.061 --> 08:41.980
What am I doing?

08:43.941 --> 08:46.527
<i>This is the riverside
Where lowlifes gather</i>

08:46.652 --> 08:49.446
<i>The ones stuck here
All have foul mouths</i>

08:49.530 --> 08:51.406
<i>Success is hidden
behind the clouds here</i>

08:51.532 --> 08:53.951
<i>Our future and the sky are both gray</i>

08:54.076 --> 08:56.245
<i>The air's dirty
The water's just as bad</i>

08:56.370 --> 08:58.497
<i>My asthma's worse
'm feeling weak</i>

08:58.580 --> 09:00.874
<i>A place even God wants to leave</i>

09:00.999 --> 09:03.377
<i>An experience I can see
Only with my eyes</i>

09:03.460 --> 09:05.879
<i>Can't live luxuriously</i>

09:06.004 --> 09:07.839
<i>It's choking me
But it's my home</i>

09:07.965 --> 09:09.258
Let me through.

09:09.383 --> 09:13.011
<i>I won't give up, but I'll shout my name
I made up my mind</i>

09:13.345 --> 09:17.182
- So, what did you think of the tour?
- Hey, I've seen you before.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.561
You do bikini modeling, don't you?
She's famous.

09:20.686 --> 09:25.190
- The witch of high school track-and-field.
- So, you can run fast?

09:25.774 --> 09:27.234
Excuse me.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.235
Sir.

09:28.360 --> 09:29.945
Please, stop.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.572
Akira.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.866
- I happened to pass by...
- Did you follow me?

09:35.325 --> 09:39.871
Did you just come out
from the sea or something, Mr. Mermaid?

09:39.997 --> 09:43.166
Yup, I'm a mermaid just arrived
from the faraway sea.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.377
- Shut up.
- Then go back to the faraway sea.

09:46.128 --> 09:47.212
Akira!

09:54.219 --> 09:55.178
Akira.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.306
Who is it this time?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.100
A guy in all-white,
and a coat in the summer?

10:02.019 --> 10:03.729
Ryo?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.316
Come with me, Akira.

10:08.817 --> 10:09.776
Excuse me.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.321
We're in the middle of something.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.700
You guys stay quiet.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.202
- What did you just say?
- Akira.

10:19.328 --> 10:20.412
Ryo.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.664
Stop messing around!

10:23.040 --> 10:24.625
Wow, wait, wait!

10:25.167 --> 10:26.752
Why, you...

10:27.294 --> 10:29.296
Akira, come with me right away.

10:29.421 --> 10:30.964
Akira, who is that guy?

10:31.089 --> 10:35.177
Ryo Asuka. We're the same age,
but he's a professor in the States.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.136
Let's go.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.763
No, don't go, Akira!

10:37.888 --> 10:40.557
Don't follow a guy like that!

10:44.186 --> 10:47.689
They're gone! Look at what you've done!

10:50.233 --> 10:51.568
She's so fast.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.116
Ryo, is that...?

10:58.325 --> 10:59.451
A machine gun.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.078
Not that.

11:01.203 --> 11:03.538
You can't survive by obeying laws.

11:03.664 --> 11:06.958
You can't drive in Japan
with an American license.

11:07.084 --> 11:09.836
- You're driving without a license?
- Get a phone.

11:09.961 --> 11:13.006
I couldn't track your GPS,
so I tracked the girl's.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.718
- You know Miki? How'd you find--?
- Why do you run?

11:16.843 --> 11:19.429
It's common in track.
People ask a lot.

11:19.554 --> 11:21.556
The human ability of movement

11:21.682 --> 11:24.976
can never reach
those of dogs, cats, or birds.

11:25.352 --> 11:29.523
Weapons and vehicles are what bring out
the abilities of humans.

11:34.569 --> 11:37.989
Fikira died last month.
He was a Russian scholar.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.993
<i>I was asked
to research the ancient people,</i>

11:42.327 --> 11:44.538
<i>and in order to learn an old language</i>

11:44.663 --> 11:47.999
<i>of the Amazon,
I went deep into the jungle.</i>

11:49.251 --> 11:51.086
Professor Fikira?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.965
Professor Fikira?

11:58.301 --> 11:59.344
Professor.

12:03.098 --> 12:06.977
The chirping birds were getting
on my nerves.

12:07.102 --> 12:09.312
But they're caught now, finally.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.189
They're quiet now.

12:28.123 --> 12:29.458
That can't be.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.141
This is...

12:52.439 --> 12:53.857
Hey, what are you doing?

12:55.609 --> 12:57.527
I can't keep it down.

12:57.652 --> 12:59.863
I must die while I'm still human.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.866
Damn it.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.369
No, you'll explode.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.623
A shame, since I came
to know more about you.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.802
You devil. Damn it.

13:33.688 --> 13:37.526
Fikira's burnt corpse weighed
twice as much as he did when he was alive.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.655
Twice as heavy,
even though he was charred.

13:41.780 --> 13:43.698
Something was inside him.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.117
Something?

13:46.243 --> 13:47.160
A devil.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.578
A devil?

13:48.703 --> 13:52.749
The natives he was researching
were the devils.

13:53.124 --> 13:57.754
Devils have existed
on Earth since long before humans.

13:57.879 --> 14:01.591
They are ferocious, extremely savage,
and have no emotion.

14:01.716 --> 14:05.762
But they are creatures skilled at fighting
and surviving.

14:06.263 --> 14:08.974
No devil has ever
been seen in its true form.

14:09.099 --> 14:13.895
They cannot exist unless they
merge with some living thing.

14:14.020 --> 14:17.023
They merged
with superior creatures each time

14:17.148 --> 14:18.775
in order to survive,

14:18.900 --> 14:22.028
keeping their abilities and evolving.

14:22.153 --> 14:25.031
You mean the extra weight was a devil?

14:25.156 --> 14:28.910
And now there are devils
who have gained the ability

14:29.035 --> 14:31.997
to live while still keeping a human body.

14:32.122 --> 14:35.917
On the other hand,
if we don't lose to the devil's will,

14:36.042 --> 14:40.547
it's possible to gain its power
while remaining a human.

14:40.672 --> 14:44.342
Fikira probably tried
to prove that with his own body.

14:44.467 --> 14:48.346
But he failed.
There have been a lot of cases lately

14:48.471 --> 14:50.765
of brutal unsolved mysteries.

14:50.891 --> 14:55.145
Strange mass disappearances,
reports of unprecedented violence,

14:55.270 --> 14:58.857
athletes who suddenly show
astounding physical abilities,

14:58.982 --> 15:01.067
and other things seen by people.

15:01.192 --> 15:04.779
Those phenomena dovetail perfectly
and can be explained easily.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.282
The devils are spreading.

15:07.616 --> 15:10.452
The heads of police
and the Public Security Division

15:10.577 --> 15:12.829
around the world must know.

15:13.330 --> 15:16.958
- Why haven't they made it public?
- They're scared of a panic.

15:17.083 --> 15:20.170
But if it's the truth,
everyone should know.

15:20.295 --> 15:24.341
It'll be a disaster if people don't
take precautionary measures on their own.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.635
If Fikira's hypothesis is true,

15:26.760 --> 15:32.015
we're going to confirm it, get evidence,
and tell the world. That's my mission.

15:36.603 --> 15:37.854
Is it here?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.490
Sorry for dragging you into this.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.035
If possible,
I wanted to find out the truth with you.

15:52.160 --> 15:56.456
But there's a big risk that comes with it.
You might get eaten by a devil,

15:56.581 --> 16:01.294
or end up pouring gasoline over your head,
just like Fikira.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.672
Ryo, why me?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.715
I'm scared.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.968
I'm so terrified.

16:08.093 --> 16:11.513
This is a horrific legacy
that Fikira left me.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.683
I must find out the truth.

16:14.808 --> 16:18.228
And I wanted to tell this to you
before anyone else,

16:18.353 --> 16:20.188
as soon as I could.

16:20.939 --> 16:23.858
You're the only one I can trust.

16:23.984 --> 16:27.737
I need your help.
We're gonna tell everyone the truth.

16:27.862 --> 16:31.700
When we go back alive,
everyone will thank us.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.910
Thanks.

16:34.035 --> 16:35.662
Okay, Ryo.

16:35.787 --> 16:38.206
I trust you, Ryo.

16:38.832 --> 16:39.958
Thanks, Akira.

16:40.083 --> 16:40.917
Let's go.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.837
There's no going back.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.798
We're going to prove devils exist!

17:07.485 --> 17:09.195
Here you go.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.409
Do you prefer Devidevi?

17:23.877 --> 17:25.003
Is he a first-timer?

17:25.128 --> 17:27.422
Yeah,
he just got dumped by his girl.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.132
He's cute.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.301
Hope to bump into you later.

17:48.777 --> 17:51.446
It's Sabbath, the latest popular party.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.240
What? Are we going to summon the devil?

17:55.116 --> 17:59.287
I know the Sabbath party is
where people get possessed by devils.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.208
But the devil won't come
to a fake scene like this.

18:08.797 --> 18:09.798
Ryo.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.604
Demons love blood.

18:25.897 --> 18:26.815
Ryo.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.316
What's wrong?

18:28.441 --> 18:29.609
What is it?

18:30.235 --> 18:31.069
There's blood!

18:31.194 --> 18:32.612
- Hey!
- That guy!

18:32.737 --> 18:33.613
Ryo.

18:34.405 --> 18:36.991
Both Black Mass
and Sabbath come with blood.

18:39.160 --> 18:39.953
Blood.

18:40.078 --> 18:42.330
Blood! Blood!

18:48.044 --> 18:50.463
Stop! Ryo, stop it!

18:50.588 --> 18:53.258
They're all scum anyway.
There's no need to be sad.

18:53.633 --> 18:54.843
You're scum, too!

18:57.929 --> 18:59.430
- Ryo!
- You, too!

19:08.398 --> 19:11.901
You want to touch my boobs?
Look behind you.

19:12.527 --> 19:13.820
Take that!

19:56.696 --> 19:57.530
It started.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.582
No.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.083
Help me!

20:10.043 --> 20:11.002
But...

20:37.820 --> 20:39.781
Amon. Now's your chance.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.699
Possess Akira. Amon.

21:16.442 --> 21:17.068
Ryo!

21:21.864 --> 21:23.700
<i>Why do you run?</i>

21:23.825 --> 21:27.161
<i>Your physical ability is nothing,
compared to even cats and dogs.</i>

21:27.787 --> 21:29.622
<i>You would get eaten by a devil.</i>

21:29.747 --> 21:31.791
<i>Eaten... Eaten...</i>

21:31.916 --> 21:34.252
<i>Eaten... Eaten...</i>

22:19.213 --> 22:19.881
Amon?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.382
Amon?

22:46.157 --> 22:50.536
<i>I've made Akira into a devil.</i>

22:52.705 --> 22:53.664
<i>And...</i>

22:54.457 --> 23:00.922
<i>I might have created the most powerful,
ruthless, and brutal devil in this world.</i>
