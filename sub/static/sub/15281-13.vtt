00:27.300 --> 00:29.200
woman: Rib eye,
adam and eve on a wrap,

00:29.200 --> 00:30.800
steak-umm,
and a strawberry shake

00:31.000 --> 00:33.100
for the gentleman
at table 8.
???????

00:33.300 --> 00:34.400
Ah, finally!

00:34.400 --> 00:35.700
You walk into my life.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.400
What took you
so long, handsome?

00:39.900 --> 00:40.700
Honey?

00:43.100 --> 00:44.200
Waitress:
No, thanks.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.100
I don't need anything.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.400
Mind if i sit here?

00:51.400 --> 00:52.200
Please.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.900
you should try
fat sam's milk shakes.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.400
I'm cold and tired.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.599
Man: You're also not
from around here.

01:05.000 --> 01:05.900
Where are you from?

01:13.500 --> 01:15.700
man: You really
should try the shakes.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.300
what's your name?

01:20.200 --> 01:21.000
come on.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.900
Names are
a hobby of mine.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.900
Jason gideon.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.400
Jason.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.000
From greek mythology.

01:28.700 --> 01:29.400
To heal.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.200
Gideon.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.600
A hero from
the old testament

01:34.400 --> 01:36.700
who led the israelites
against the midianites.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.600
Your parents had
great ambitions for you.

01:41.100 --> 01:41.900
I'm frank.

01:42.500 --> 01:43.500
Germanic.

01:43.500 --> 01:44.500
Third century.

01:45.300 --> 01:48.300
Derived from the name
of a type of spear.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.300
I wonder what aspirations
my parents had for me.

01:53.400 --> 01:54.800
Why don't we cut
the crap, frank?

01:55.100 --> 01:56.000
Where is she?

01:56.300 --> 01:57.700
Now, that's direct.

01:58.500 --> 01:59.300
You're right.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.400
I'm not from
around here.

02:02.400 --> 02:03.800
I'm an fbi agent.

02:05.700 --> 02:06.400
The bau?

02:07.400 --> 02:09.300
You didn't disappoint
your parents.

02:10.100 --> 02:11.100
We're looking
for a man

02:11.100 --> 02:13.100
in his mid-
to late-fifties.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.200
Listens to beethoven,

02:15.700 --> 02:18.100
wears a corduroy jacket
with fleece-lined collar.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.500
He's left-handed.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.200
In his right inside
jacket pocket

02:23.200 --> 02:24.200
will be a notebook,

02:25.200 --> 02:27.700
and it will give
the extensive
detailed accounts

02:27.700 --> 02:31.600
of the torture
inflicted on every
one of his victims.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.600
That's quite a magic trick.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.100
No magic trick, frank.

02:35.100 --> 02:37.400
Just a profile of
a sadistic serial killer.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.300
Gideon, this thing
is brand-new.

02:40.700 --> 02:41.900
There's only two
entries in it:

02:42.400 --> 02:44.400
"Black male,
220 pounds, portly;

02:44.800 --> 02:46.200
white female,
early twenties."

02:46.700 --> 02:47.900
This doesn't
prove anything.

02:50.100 --> 02:50.900
Guess what.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.000
When i'm finished
with my shake,

02:55.800 --> 02:57.400
you'll get what
you're here for,

02:58.000 --> 02:58.800
but then...

02:59.800 --> 03:01.000
i'm going to get up...

03:02.100 --> 03:03.600
and i'm going to
walk out of here...

03:04.500 --> 03:05.300
and you...

03:06.100 --> 03:07.800
and your lapdog...

03:09.100 --> 03:10.600
are going to let me.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.100
You know what,
frank?

03:16.300 --> 03:18.000
That would be
a magic trick.

Gideon, voice-over:
Aristotle once said

evil brings
men together.

04:10.300 --> 04:11.300
I don't give
a rat's ass.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.400
Feds or no feds...

04:12.400 --> 04:13.900
that bastard doesn't
give her back to us

04:13.900 --> 04:15.100
in the next 15 minutes,

04:15.100 --> 04:16.300
we go in! Agreed?!

04:16.300 --> 04:17.100
Agreed!
Agreed!

04:17.100 --> 04:19.300
Agreed?!
Agreed!

04:27.400 --> 04:28.100
He's looked
at that clock

04:28.100 --> 04:29.300
3 times in as many minutes.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.400
He's waiting for something.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.400
If i had
your looks...

04:33.600 --> 04:35.400
do you know how much
easier my life would be?

04:36.600 --> 04:37.700
If you think you're
gonna negotiate

04:37.700 --> 04:38.800
you way out of this one,

04:40.300 --> 04:41.700
you got a whole
nother thing coming.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.100
Want to know how
we caught you?

04:46.300 --> 04:47.400
Please.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.000
Derek: Gideon, those men out
there want to kill this guy.

04:49.000 --> 04:49.800
We're in the middle.

04:49.800 --> 04:51.100
We don't have time
for explanations.

04:51.300 --> 04:52.600
Frank: You have
the time it will take me

04:52.600 --> 04:54.000
to finish this shake.

04:54.500 --> 04:55.600
That's all i need.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.700
We got a request from
sheriff georgia davis.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.800
Jj: 1996.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.700
The ribcage of
a male was found

05:06.700 --> 05:08.600
in the desert rose
national park.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.900
It was never identified.

05:10.500 --> 05:13.000
This morning,
the remains of two victims

05:13.000 --> 05:15.600
were found in almost
exactly the same area.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.500
Well, one year
later is cause
for concern,

05:18.500 --> 05:19.800
but 10 years?

05:19.800 --> 05:21.100
That could be
a coincidence.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.000
It would be...

05:22.800 --> 05:24.900
if the unidentified
male wasn't missing

05:24.900 --> 05:25.900
a right rib bone.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.500
And the torso
found this morning

05:27.500 --> 05:29.000
is missing exactly
the same bone.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Both of them
seem to be

05:30.000 --> 05:31.200
surgically removed,

05:31.200 --> 05:32.500
and the advanced rate
of decomposition

05:32.500 --> 05:34.000
on the male means
that he died

05:34.000 --> 05:35.200
far before the female.

05:35.400 --> 05:36.600
Oh, katherine hale.

05:36.900 --> 05:38.900
They found
a bracelet
on her wrist.

05:38.900 --> 05:40.600
She ran away about
two weeks ago

05:40.600 --> 05:41.900
from her small
colorado town.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.400
Unsub's crossing
state lines.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.200
He's mobile.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.500
Derek: If the remains are
related to the same killer,

05:46.500 --> 05:47.600
where's he been
for 10 years?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.400
Killing.

05:49.300 --> 05:51.400
Unsolved case files
going back 30 years.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.300
Every case,
the victimology
is the same.

05:56.700 --> 05:57.800
The unwanted.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.300
This box is just
the tip of the iceberg.

06:00.300 --> 06:02.300
13 cases spanning
30 years.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.400
Same m.o.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.200
Right rib bone
is missing.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.100
It's him, hotch.
It's the same killer.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.900
All the remains were
dumped in remote areas

06:10.900 --> 06:12.700
and always near
interstate 80.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.900
And up till now,
no remains this intact

06:14.900 --> 06:16.800
or this close to
the actual time of kill

06:16.800 --> 06:17.600
have been found.

06:17.700 --> 06:19.800
Never two victims dumped
at the same time

06:20.800 --> 06:21.900
in the same place.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.100
All of these
killings

06:24.100 --> 06:25.500
the work
of just one man?

06:27.100 --> 06:29.500
The most prolific
serial killer ever.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.400
Wow.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.500
You truly think...
i know it.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.900
Which is why
we came here...

06:37.400 --> 06:38.300
to nevada.

06:51.900 --> 06:53.000
You seen enough, kid?

06:53.300 --> 06:54.200
Go on, get out of here.

06:55.100 --> 06:55.900
George!

06:56.600 --> 06:57.400
They're here.

06:57.400 --> 06:59.100
That cop
drive 60 miles

06:59.100 --> 06:59.900
just to barf.

07:00.700 --> 07:02.000
No good reason
to be here,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
not even from
this department.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.800
What is it
about death that
fascinates us?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.600
He didn't contaminate
the scene, did he?

07:07.600 --> 07:08.300
No, uh...

07:08.500 --> 07:09.900
sheriff georgia davis.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.700
People call me
george.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.600
This is deputy
rick silo.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.400
Aaron hotchner.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.400
This is
derek morgan,

07:19.400 --> 07:21.600
and the guy who
sometimes forgets
his manners

07:21.600 --> 07:22.300
is jason gideon.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.600
Stood here
10 years ago,

07:26.900 --> 07:28.100
this exact spot.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.200
Same feeling
i have now.

07:30.500 --> 07:31.400
Which is what?

07:31.900 --> 07:33.000
Someone in my town

07:33.000 --> 07:34.400
might be responsible
for it.

07:35.900 --> 07:37.200
Hope you tell
me i'm wrong.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.800
Oh, my cell.
That's my husband.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.000
That's our song.
Excuse me.

07:42.300 --> 07:43.500
Silo: Lucky we found anything.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.900
Been a recent spike
in the coyote population.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.000
Maybe that's
why the unsub

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
dumps the bodies here.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.000
Silo: You people
really think

07:52.000 --> 07:53.700
we have a serial killer
in our town?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.500
At least one that
passes through

07:55.500 --> 07:56.300
from time to time.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.300
Is it just me,
or do you get
the feeling

08:03.300 --> 08:04.300
that we're not
welcome here.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.500
Oh, it's not us.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.500
It's what
we represent.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.700
Government's not all
that popular out here.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
Woman: No!

08:10.200 --> 08:11.000
No, you can't
make me go!

08:11.000 --> 08:12.300
I know what my rights are!

08:12.300 --> 08:13.100
No, don't make me go!

08:13.100 --> 08:14.500
No, i don't
want to go home!

08:14.500 --> 08:15.900
I know my rights!
Come on!

08:15.900 --> 08:17.200
What are you
looking at, princess?!

08:18.700 --> 08:19.900
Ok, ok!

08:19.900 --> 08:21.300
If that's the way
you want it, jane,

08:21.300 --> 08:22.400
back to jail.
Ok, ok, ok.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.900
Ok, ok, ok.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.400
He's coming.
He's coming back,

08:26.400 --> 08:28.100
and there's nothing
you can do about it!

08:28.400 --> 08:30.800
Do you hear me?!
Nothing, nothing!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.299
Come on, jane!
Come on!

08:34.600 --> 08:35.700
Excuse me.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.600
She dropped this.

08:38.799 --> 08:40.000
It's harmless.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.700
Thank you.

08:47.900 --> 08:48.800
What is it?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.300
A psycho
with a whistle.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.000
That's not
too weird.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.500
Derek: Looks like
prison gang tattoos.

09:00.800 --> 09:03.500
This unsub has extensive
anatomic anomalies.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.600
Well, the pen marks
are a guidelines

09:05.600 --> 09:07.200
for a surgeon's knife.
That's for sure.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.400
Did he cauterize
the main arteries?

09:09.900 --> 09:11.000
Yeah, all of them.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.100
What do you mean?

09:12.400 --> 09:14.200
He cauterized the arteries
by burning them.

09:14.500 --> 09:15.400
Why?

09:15.600 --> 09:16.900
It stops the blood flow.

09:17.700 --> 09:18.600
The victims
were alive

09:18.600 --> 09:19.900
when he cut off
their limbs.

09:21.000 --> 09:22.500
Garcia's gonna love this.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.200
Garcia: Oh, this is so

09:28.500 --> 09:30.300
not a way to
a girl's heart.

09:32.600 --> 09:33.700
What are you doing?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.100
I'm mapping out

09:36.100 --> 09:38.200
where all the victims
were found...

09:38.200 --> 09:40.400
starting with gideon's
first case file.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.500
Ow! Stabby.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.100
Ok, so katherine hale...

09:47.400 --> 09:50.100
was last seen here

09:50.100 --> 09:51.500
in salt lake city, utah,

09:51.500 --> 09:54.400
and then found
right here

09:55.200 --> 09:56.600
in golconda, nevada.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.500
Ahh.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.600
Well, the tattoo is
from a prison gang.

10:01.600 --> 10:02.900
It was photographed
and logged

10:02.900 --> 10:04.100
in san quentin.

10:04.100 --> 10:07.200
This one belongs
to reno rodriguez, 42.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.900
Jumped bail 7 months ago,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.300
picked up by cops in
salt lake city 5 weeks ago.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.200
Ok, so say he
was abducted

10:13.200 --> 10:15.200
somewhere close to where
he was last seen.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.400
Next was katherine hale.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.200
It appears this unsub
is traveling

10:20.200 --> 10:22.500
from east to west
towards golconda.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.200
If he lives there,
where's he coming from?

10:27.900 --> 10:29.000
The only these
two victims

10:29.000 --> 10:30.100
have in common is
they were killed

10:30.100 --> 10:31.000
by the same unsub.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.300
There is another
connection.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.800
?????????

10:56.100 --> 10:57.100
Derek: Excuse me, miss?

10:57.100 --> 10:57.800
Yeah?

10:59.700 --> 11:01.000
You ever seen
that man before?

11:01.900 --> 11:03.100
Waitress:
Over the years, yeah.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.400
He never eats.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.400
He just orders
a strawberry milk shake.

11:08.300 --> 11:09.100
Thank you.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.000
Sure.

11:15.000 --> 11:15.900
Frank: You were saying?

11:16.300 --> 11:18.000
The story involves
wind chimes,

11:18.000 --> 11:19.500
trailers,
alien abductions.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.300
Gripping.

11:21.700 --> 11:23.100
I thought i'd seen
the very worst

11:23.100 --> 11:24.500
of what humanity
had to offer

11:24.500 --> 11:25.300
until you.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
Can i ask you
something?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.100
Please.

11:34.900 --> 11:36.400
Do you think me insane?

11:38.500 --> 11:40.700
Do not play me.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.500
You know exactly
what you are,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.000
a psychopathic
sexual sadist.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.800
You get off
on the brutal
torture of others.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.600
Derek: And you knew
the moment we arrived
in this town

11:55.600 --> 11:56.800
you had no way out.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.500
Which is why
you took her.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.000
Who's playing who now?

12:03.300 --> 12:04.500
You don't care about her.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.100
You only ever cared
about catching me.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.400
It isn't the victims
that drives you, jason.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.600
It's the hunt.

12:14.700 --> 12:15.900
Derek: Look out
that window, frank.

12:16.500 --> 12:17.300
Hunt's over.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.000
You aren't
denying it.

12:22.100 --> 12:23.600
Men, women,

12:24.000 --> 12:25.200
young, old.

12:26.300 --> 12:27.400
Didn't matter
to you.

12:27.800 --> 12:28.900
You took them all.

12:29.900 --> 12:31.600
From san francisco's
muir woods

12:32.000 --> 12:33.800
to the hills
of the poconos...

12:34.700 --> 12:35.600
you took them all.

12:38.600 --> 12:40.100
Garcia: If they
are all connected,

12:41.300 --> 12:43.600
he's killed
hundreds of people

12:43.600 --> 12:44.800
all over north america.

12:45.300 --> 12:47.000
How many years
do they go back again?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.100
30.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.200
All right, keep going.

12:50.500 --> 12:51.800
Sacramento, california...

12:53.900 --> 12:55.200
lincoln, nebraska...

12:57.000 --> 12:58.100
gary, indiana...

13:00.500 --> 13:02.000
if we can figure out
where he's been,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.400
maybe we can figure out
the significance

13:03.400 --> 13:04.800
golconda has to him.

13:05.900 --> 13:07.500
Want to hear
the really bad news?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.200
Can it get worse?

13:09.700 --> 13:10.600
Just did.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.800
Early toxilogical
investigations

13:17.800 --> 13:19.000
of the victim's
blood indicated

13:19.000 --> 13:20.400
high levels of ketamine.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.500
Ketamine is primarily
a horse tranquilizer.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.600
It's also used
as a date-rape drug.

13:25.900 --> 13:27.000
In street lingo,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.800
it's known as being
stuck in a k-hole.

13:29.100 --> 13:31.200
So his victims were
completely conscious

13:31.200 --> 13:32.000
when he killed them?

13:33.000 --> 13:34.600
Imagine what she must
have gone through.

13:35.500 --> 13:36.800
It's essential
for this unsub

13:36.800 --> 13:39.300
that he sees the terror
in his victim's eyes.

13:39.300 --> 13:40.500
That is what
gets him off.

13:40.900 --> 13:42.000
Hotch: He's either
had medical training,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.600
or he's honed his skills
over the years.

13:44.900 --> 13:47.400
Gideon: Look for
a man in his mid-
to late-fifties,

13:47.400 --> 13:48.900
highly intelligent,

13:48.900 --> 13:50.700
methodically
and obsessively clean.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.800
Emily: His vehicle is
most likely an rv,

13:52.800 --> 13:54.000
muted in color,

13:54.200 --> 13:55.400
neither old nor new,

13:55.400 --> 13:56.500
in perfect working order.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Derek: It will have
a cb, radar detectors,

13:59.000 --> 14:00.000
and police-band radio.

14:00.300 --> 14:01.800
All these things have
helped him evade you.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.100
Hotch: And this vehicle
is his killing room.

14:04.100 --> 14:05.400
It'll be soundproofed.

14:05.700 --> 14:07.600
Surgical instruments
are on the walls.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.900
There's a stirrup chair

14:08.900 --> 14:10.300
or an autopsy table in it.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.000
Gideon: All of his
kills are recorded...

14:12.300 --> 14:13.500
if not on video,

14:14.000 --> 14:14.900
in a journal

14:16.300 --> 14:17.200
that he carries
with him

14:17.200 --> 14:19.700
in his right-hand
inside jacket pocket.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.600
How could you know that?

14:21.900 --> 14:23.400
Tool marks
on the remains

14:23.400 --> 14:24.700
indicate that
he's left-handed.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.700
This man is void of all
normal human feelings.

14:30.900 --> 14:31.800
Gideon:
A killing machine...

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
incapable of remorse,

14:34.500 --> 14:36.600
compassion, love.

14:42.800 --> 14:43.700
What's the matter,
frank?

14:48.200 --> 14:49.300
Something
i said?

14:50.700 --> 14:52.100
Got him all
worked up, gideon.

14:56.100 --> 14:56.800
Frank: Beauty...

14:57.400 --> 14:59.600
can cover
a multitude of sins,

15:00.900 --> 15:02.000
but underneath...

15:03.600 --> 15:04.700
we all look...

15:05.700 --> 15:07.400
exactly the same.

15:07.900 --> 15:09.500
I know what gets you off...

15:09.800 --> 15:11.900
fear... seeing it
and feeling it.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.700
Well, look out
that window, frank.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.800
You are not leaving
this diner.

15:16.400 --> 15:17.500
I don't want to.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.500
Not until
the story is done.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.900
Silo: We have roadblocks
on every interstate,

15:26.900 --> 15:28.800
track or laned
in or out of this town.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.600
We'll shut down this
state if we have to.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.500
Stop every rv,
truck, and trailer.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.800
Something troubling you?

15:40.400 --> 15:41.900
That profile you gave,

15:42.300 --> 15:44.000
it reminds me of
a story i once heard.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.200
There's someone
you should meet.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.600
How you feeling, jane?

15:53.900 --> 15:55.700
I don't want to
go home, george.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.700
Please don't
make me go home.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.100
Jane...

16:01.100 --> 16:02.500
these people
are from the fbi.

16:03.300 --> 16:04.900
I'd like you to
tell them your story.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.000
Why, so they can
make fun of me, too?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.400
It's very pretty.

16:13.000 --> 16:13.800
Did you make it?

16:19.100 --> 16:20.100
It was a gift.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.400
Oh.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.500
What happened to you?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.100
My car broke down.

16:39.200 --> 16:40.800
The engine went
out on me and...

16:41.600 --> 16:42.700
you know, in those days,

16:42.700 --> 16:43.800
they didn't have
cell phones,

16:43.800 --> 16:45.600
so i tried to
fix it myself.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.800
?????????

16:52.100 --> 16:53.600
And then everything
went white.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.100
I was in a spaceship.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.500
And i could see myself.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.400
It was like time
was suspended.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.099
I could feel everything,

17:05.099 --> 17:07.800
and there were strange
maps on the walls...

17:08.599 --> 17:10.200
diagrams of all the stars.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.099
I was cold.

17:12.300 --> 17:13.500
It was very, very cold.

17:16.599 --> 17:18.800
And the alien,
he did things to me.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.700
He touched me...

17:21.000 --> 17:24.200
very softly,
and he stroked my hair,

17:24.900 --> 17:26.599
and he drew lines
all over my body,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.900
and the whole time,
he was standing there

17:29.900 --> 17:31.200
smiling down on me.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.900
And then i looked
into his eyes...

17:37.200 --> 17:38.800
and i wasn't
afraid anymore.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.000
I don't know why.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.800
Then what did he do?

17:47.700 --> 17:48.800
And then i...

17:49.700 --> 17:50.700
was back in my own bed,

17:50.800 --> 17:51.900
and it was
the next morning.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.400
Emily: How long ago
did this happen?

17:55.200 --> 17:56.300
I was 19.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.400
It was 30 years ago.

18:00.600 --> 18:02.400
Emily: And did you
ever see him again?

18:02.700 --> 18:03.700
Oh, i see him.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.400
I see him every time
i shut my eyes.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.500
The strange maps
on the walls

18:13.500 --> 18:15.100
could have been
anatomical drawings.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.500
What about the fact that
she could see herself?

18:18.600 --> 18:19.900
A mirrored
ceiling.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.100
So his victims
could see
themselves

18:22.100 --> 18:23.200
being
dismembered.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.400
Every time i think
it can't get any
worse, it does.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.700
Gideon: Her
subconscious mind

18:28.700 --> 18:30.400
has created a delusion

18:31.700 --> 18:33.700
that she was
abducted by an alien.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.900
Emily: It's possible
she's the only one

18:35.900 --> 18:36.900
who's survived.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.600
Why did he
let her go?

18:39.400 --> 18:41.500
She said when she
looked into his eyes,

18:41.500 --> 18:42.700
she felt relaxed.

18:42.900 --> 18:43.700
And in that moment,

18:43.700 --> 18:45.100
the one thing
that he wanted...

18:47.300 --> 18:48.400
she didn't give him.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.100
Fear.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.200
Frank: I read
about a woman

18:57.200 --> 18:58.900
whose body was found
in her apartment...

18:59.900 --> 19:01.200
upper east side,
i think.

19:01.200 --> 19:02.300
If this is
a confession,

19:02.300 --> 19:03.900
start with the woman
you just took.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.700
She had killed herself.

19:07.900 --> 19:09.300
But her body
wasn't found

19:09.300 --> 19:10.400
for more than a year.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.200
Surround by over
a million people,

19:13.900 --> 19:15.800
and not one of them
missed her.

19:18.300 --> 19:21.100
What does that
say about society?

19:22.300 --> 19:24.400
Fills me with
profound sadness...

19:25.900 --> 19:27.700
but it doesn't make
you feel anything.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.700
Those that society
does not care for...

19:31.500 --> 19:33.500
the throwaways,
the runaways,

19:34.500 --> 19:35.400
destitute,

19:36.000 --> 19:37.700
disenfranchised,

19:38.600 --> 19:39.400
the forgotten...

19:42.000 --> 19:43.700
are the very people
you target.

19:46.600 --> 19:47.800
But not last night.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.400
Something changed.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.000
You took a person
of prominence,

19:54.600 --> 19:56.500
someone that
mattered to everyone.

19:59.400 --> 20:00.200
Why?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.800
That's the interesting
question, jason.

20:04.900 --> 20:05.700
Why?

20:05.700 --> 20:06.700
Silo: Mark,
don't do it!

20:06.700 --> 20:07.500
Back off, silo!

20:07.800 --> 20:08.600
Gideon!

20:10.200 --> 20:12.000
Derek: Sir, do not
come any closer!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
That man
has my wife.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.300
Please put the gun down.

20:15.700 --> 20:16.500
Tell me where
my wife is,

20:16.500 --> 20:18.000
or so help me,
i will shoot you.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.700
Sir, i said put
the gun down now!

20:19.700 --> 20:20.700
Where's my wife?!

20:20.700 --> 20:22.200
Sir, we are trying
to find your wife!

20:22.200 --> 20:23.300
Tell me where she is,
you son of a bitch!

20:23.300 --> 20:24.500
Put the gun down now!

20:28.900 --> 20:31.300
Frank: But you know
what's an even more
interesting question?

20:33.500 --> 20:36.100
??????????

20:47.600 --> 20:48.400
open it.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.200
Put it down!

20:49.200 --> 20:50.500
Open the bag!

20:53.700 --> 20:55.600
Hand over your gun.
I'll open it.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.500
I'll kill you.

21:01.300 --> 21:02.400
I will kill you.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
It's not her.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.000
Oh, thank god.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.200
Who is this?

21:21.700 --> 21:24.400
I believe the correct
question would be:

21:25.200 --> 21:26.200
"Who was this?"

21:27.000 --> 21:28.500
You are one crazy
son of a bitch!

21:28.800 --> 21:31.600
We are all sons
of bitches.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.000
Outside.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.200
Outside, please.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.600
Let us deal with him.

21:36.100 --> 21:37.200
Let us try
to find her.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600
What is this,
frank?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.200
He's irrelevant

21:43.600 --> 21:45.400
beyond being my
ticket out of here.

21:46.000 --> 21:46.900
Your ticket
out of here?

21:47.500 --> 21:48.600
Even if you
think you can

21:48.600 --> 21:49.700
get out of that
booth and pass us,

21:49.700 --> 21:51.200
i promise you those
men out there

21:51.200 --> 21:52.500
will tear you
to pieces.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.000
I rather doubt that.

21:55.300 --> 21:56.500
Finish the story, jason.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.200
We set up
a nationwide tip line,

21:59.200 --> 22:00.600
but all we've
really got so far is

22:00.600 --> 22:02.000
white male, mid-
to late-fifties,

22:02.000 --> 22:03.200
tall, with
a medium build.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.800
Gideon: From the remains
discovered this morning,

22:05.800 --> 22:07.600
we know he doesn't
keep his victims long.

22:08.300 --> 22:09.400
We've got more
cops arriving

22:09.400 --> 22:11.000
by the hour to
help find this guy.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
We also put out
a nationwide a.p.b.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
Derek: If he is
still in this town,

22:14.000 --> 22:14.800
and we believe he is,

22:14.800 --> 22:16.000
he has absolutely
no way out.

22:16.300 --> 22:17.100
What are we waiting for?

22:17.300 --> 22:18.800
Let's go catch this s.o.b.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.700
Thank you very
much for your time.

22:53.100 --> 22:54.700
How can you even be
so sure he's here?

22:54.700 --> 22:55.500
He could have
left town

22:55.500 --> 22:56.800
when we found
those remains.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.300
Of all the cases
where remains were found,

23:00.300 --> 23:02.000
yesterday's discovery
was unique.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.300
That's one way
of putting it.

23:03.300 --> 23:04.600
Hotch: He's never
dumped the remains

23:04.600 --> 23:07.000
of two victims
before. Why?

23:07.000 --> 23:08.400
Silo: I want to know
why he's managed

23:08.400 --> 23:09.500
to get away with it
for so long.

23:10.100 --> 23:11.200
Spencer: To get
away with murder,

23:11.200 --> 23:12.800
you simply don't
tell anyone.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
And the only
people he told

23:13.800 --> 23:14.700
were the people
he killed,

23:15.300 --> 23:16.600
and then he took from
them what he needed...

23:16.600 --> 23:18.000
cash, credit cards.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.800
I'm gonna call garcia

23:19.800 --> 23:21.600
and see if anything
katherine hale owned

23:21.600 --> 23:22.900
was used after her death.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.500
And then he moved on

23:25.500 --> 23:26.800
to his next
victim...

23:27.900 --> 23:29.100
...till he
reach golconda.

23:30.300 --> 23:31.400
And for some reason,

23:32.400 --> 23:33.300
emptied his vehicle

23:33.300 --> 23:34.500
before driving in...

23:34.500 --> 23:36.100
...where he dumps
his first two victims

23:36.100 --> 23:37.200
in the exact same spot.

23:37.200 --> 23:37.800
You know...

23:38.500 --> 23:40.500
it's almost like he's
purging his vehicle

23:40.500 --> 23:41.600
before he drives
into town.

23:41.900 --> 23:42.600
Yeah, i don't know.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.200
It almost seems
like the unsub

23:44.200 --> 23:46.200
is always traveling
from east to west,

23:46.500 --> 23:48.600
passing through
every state

23:48.900 --> 23:50.200
the same month
every year.

23:53.100 --> 23:54.200
The remains that
were discovered

23:54.200 --> 23:56.100
10 years ago was
the same month
as this, right?

23:56.100 --> 23:57.300
Right, and then for
a week after that,

23:57.400 --> 23:58.300
the trail goes dead.

23:58.600 --> 24:00.600
Yeah, it's like
he takes a vacation
in golconda.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.500
So where is his rv?

24:09.600 --> 24:11.200
Maybe he's not
using an rv.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.800
Maybe he's towing
a trailer.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.300
That way he could unhook
and move about freely.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.100
He could also
hide it.

24:16.100 --> 24:17.000
That's why
we can't find him.

24:17.300 --> 24:19.100
He's waiting for
the roadblocks to clear.

24:19.100 --> 24:20.300
Ok, if he has a truck,

24:20.300 --> 24:21.300
it's gonna be just
like his trailer...

24:21.400 --> 24:23.200
muted in color
and american-made.

24:23.500 --> 24:24.300
It's gonna
be dark soon.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.300
We should to back
and call gideon.

24:26.800 --> 24:27.900
I think the unsub's
in town somewhere.

24:28.000 --> 24:28.800
Yeah.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.600
Gideon: We have to
get back into town

24:35.200 --> 24:36.900
and search garages,
warehouses,

24:36.900 --> 24:39.100
any place someone could
hide a large trailer.

24:39.100 --> 24:41.700
Like you said, he
never takes victims

24:41.700 --> 24:42.400
when he's here.

24:43.100 --> 24:44.600
So if he's not
going anywhere

24:44.600 --> 24:45.900
and he hasn't
got anyone,

24:46.600 --> 24:47.800
we can wait till
the morning.

24:47.800 --> 24:49.400
Wait? We can't wait.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.900
The men
are tired,
i'm tired.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.400
We got roadblocks
on every road.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.600
Gideon,
she's right.

24:53.600 --> 24:54.900
We could wait till
first light, gideon.

24:55.000 --> 24:56.100
Do what you like.
I'm gonna find him.

24:56.700 --> 24:57.900
It's gonna be
a long night.

24:59.000 --> 24:59.700
I'm sorry.

24:59.700 --> 25:00.600
I got to relieve
my men

25:00.600 --> 25:01.400
and get back
to the office.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.300
I understand.
I'll talk to him.

25:08.700 --> 25:10.000
Hey, garcia...
aah!

25:12.000 --> 25:13.100
I like knocking.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.800
Oh, well, i have been
going over the tip line

25:15.800 --> 25:17.900
for hours going
over all the calls,

25:17.900 --> 25:18.800
and i think
i found something.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.500
An anonymous caller
claimed they saw an

25:21.700 --> 25:22.600
that matched
the description

25:22.600 --> 25:23.800
of the one we gave
to the media...

25:24.600 --> 25:25.600
leaving golconda.

25:26.100 --> 25:26.800
Thank you.

25:28.300 --> 25:29.000
Yeah?

25:29.000 --> 25:31.600
Firstly, not a single
rv or trailer

25:31.600 --> 25:32.600
has passed through
any of the roadblocks...

25:32.600 --> 25:33.500
i checked.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.600
Secondly?
Why call anonymously

25:36.500 --> 25:38.300
i need you to
trace this number.

25:38.800 --> 25:41.200
It's 303-555-0126.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.600
It's a cell phone...

25:44.700 --> 25:46.000
belonging to...

25:47.000 --> 25:48.200
katherine hale?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.400
It's from golconda.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.300
This guy, he could have
just kept on going.

25:54.300 --> 25:55.600
We may have never
caught him.

25:55.900 --> 25:56.900
With all this
heat on him,

25:56.900 --> 25:58.200
whatever is keeping
him in that town

25:58.200 --> 26:00.300
must be freaky special.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.400
Mark's away
at his mother's.

26:03.900 --> 26:04.900
Took tommy with him.

26:05.900 --> 26:07.000
Come on in.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.500
You're safe here.

26:13.200 --> 26:14.600
Well, you said you
didn't want to go home,

26:14.600 --> 26:16.000
and i couldn't
leave you in jail.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.500
Machine: You have one new message.
I'll make up the guest bedroom.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.900
Can i get you
something, a soda?

26:22.200 --> 26:23.600
Jane: Thank you
for being so kind.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.200
Man on machine:
Hey, gorgeous george!

26:25.500 --> 26:27.200
I love you, wife.
I miss you.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.200
Tommy misses you.

26:29.100 --> 26:31.600
Yeah, i guess you're
busy catching bad guys...
is he good to you?

26:31.600 --> 26:33.000
Ever since i met him.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.100
We were both 15.
Grape juice?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.600
What the hell?!

26:38.000 --> 26:38.800
Mark: Hey, tommy?

26:39.100 --> 26:40.600
He's here,
george.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.600
Mommy,
i want to come home.
Who the hell are you?!

26:44.100 --> 26:45.100
You know who i am.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.100
Don't you, jane?

26:46.200 --> 26:47.700
Stay right where
you are, jane.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.000
I want you to back off.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.200
Come with me, jane.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.300
He came for me.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.300
This man is
not an alien.

26:55.300 --> 26:56.000
He's a murderer.
Jane: It's all right.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.400
He came for me!

27:00.700 --> 27:02.200
Tommy: Oh, mom,
dad let me eat candy.

27:03.800 --> 27:04.600
Jane, run.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.400
Tommy: Don't be mad at him.

27:06.400 --> 27:07.400
Run, jane!

27:08.500 --> 27:10.100
Run, please!

27:10.500 --> 27:11.800
Jane, no!

27:12.300 --> 27:13.600
Tommy: Twice.
Love you.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.000
Jane!

27:16.600 --> 27:17.500
Tommy: I love you, mommy.

27:18.700 --> 27:19.600
Good night, mom.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.300
Bye!

27:47.000 --> 27:48.500
He keeps checking
that clock

27:49.100 --> 27:50.200
because whatever
it is he came for

27:50.200 --> 27:51.600
is coming here
to this diner.

27:52.700 --> 27:53.900
Derek: Ok, then we
need to figure out

27:53.900 --> 27:54.900
what we missed, gideon.

27:55.200 --> 27:55.800
And soon.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.500
I'm almost finished.

28:12.100 --> 28:12.900
It's clear.

28:12.900 --> 28:13.700
Silo: All clear.

28:15.300 --> 28:16.700
Derek: Silo, silo,
don't touch anything.

28:16.700 --> 28:17.900
We need to
profile this room.

28:18.200 --> 28:18.900
Profile?!

28:19.200 --> 28:21.400
You said the call
was made 5 hours ago

28:21.400 --> 28:23.300
by the unsub right
outside this house!

28:23.300 --> 28:24.800
Now what's
the profile?!

28:25.300 --> 28:26.200
He took george!

28:26.500 --> 28:27.300
Why?

28:27.500 --> 28:28.600
Hotch: All right,
we need to work fast.

28:28.900 --> 28:29.900
Derek: All right,
she enters the house,

28:29.900 --> 28:31.000
and then it's habitual.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.100
Emily: Ok,
she drops her keys,

28:32.100 --> 28:33.300
hits the answering machine,

28:33.300 --> 28:34.600
takes off her gun belt.

28:34.900 --> 28:36.200
Then moves throughout
the kitchen.

28:36.200 --> 28:37.900
Gideon: He's never taken
anyone of prominence.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Why take the sheriff?

28:40.000 --> 28:40.900
And not her gun.

28:40.900 --> 28:41.800
Silo, call your office.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.000
See if she was planning
to meet anyone.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.500
No way a cop
would take chase

28:44.500 --> 28:45.300
without their gun.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.400
Definitely
looks like

28:46.400 --> 28:47.100
she tried to make
a go for it.

28:49.100 --> 28:49.800
But she didn't make it.

28:51.900 --> 28:52.700
Silo: Guys...

28:53.500 --> 28:55.300
george brought crazy jane
home with her.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.800
Derek: So, he takes
control of george,

28:58.100 --> 28:59.300
then goes after what
he came here for.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.400
Crazy jane.

29:01.500 --> 29:02.300
Those footprints,

29:02.600 --> 29:03.400
they got to
be jane's.

29:03.800 --> 29:04.600
They go to the back.

29:05.400 --> 29:06.200
She escapes.

29:06.900 --> 29:08.300
The unsub knows
the ketamine's
gonna wear off,

29:08.300 --> 29:09.100
so he's got to act.

29:10.300 --> 29:11.800
No. He hasn't got
what he came here for.

29:12.700 --> 29:14.400
Hotch: So for leverage,
he takes the sheriff,

29:14.400 --> 29:16.200
which means sooner or later,
he'll contact us.

29:21.000 --> 29:21.800
It turned back on!

29:22.400 --> 29:23.200
It just...

29:23.300 --> 29:25.400
jj, the cell phone,
it turned back on!

29:25.700 --> 29:27.100
What?
Katherine hale's
cell phone,

29:27.100 --> 29:27.900
it turned back on.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.300
Hotch: Katherine
hale's cell phone

29:33.300 --> 29:34.400
just came back on
in the middle of town.

29:35.000 --> 29:35.800
Let's do this.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.200
He thinks
we have jane.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.300
Which means he
wants a trade.

29:38.300 --> 29:40.400
Whatever he wants,
we need to find jane
and the sheriff fast.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.000
Hotch:
You go to town,
we'll go to jane's.

29:51.600 --> 29:52.500
Derek: Ok, listen up!

29:52.800 --> 29:54.500
He should be driving
a truck or suv

29:54.500 --> 29:56.600
muted in color...
black, dark brown.

29:56.600 --> 29:57.600
Or blue!

29:58.600 --> 29:59.500
??????????

30:02.000 --> 30:03.000
Like you boys said,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.900
he'll have a cb,
police-band radio,

30:04.900 --> 30:05.900
and radar detector.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.200
Hotch better find
jane, and fast.

30:37.900 --> 30:38.700
Emily: Guys!

30:39.300 --> 30:41.200
These wind chimes
are made of bone!

30:41.900 --> 30:43.400
I think it's
human rib bones.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.300
He's waiting for us.

30:53.300 --> 30:54.600
Well, let's go
get that bastard.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.200
No, we still don't
have the sheriff.

30:56.500 --> 30:58.000
Well, when i get
a hold of him, we will.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.000
Derek: Hey,
wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

31:00.000 --> 31:01.500
He's smart.
We got to be smarter.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.100
He turned that
cell phone on

31:03.100 --> 31:04.400
because by now,
he knows we're onto him.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.400
Well, you boys have
just 15 minutes,

31:06.700 --> 31:07.400
then we're coming in.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.500
15 minutes.
That's all i need.

31:17.100 --> 31:18.800
waitress: Rib eye,
adam and eve on a wrap,

31:18.800 --> 31:20.400
steak-umm,
and a strawberry shake

31:20.400 --> 31:22.600
for the gentleman
at table 8.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.100
Finally you walk
into my life.

31:25.700 --> 31:27.100
What took you
so long, handsome?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.100
Honey?

31:33.300 --> 31:34.100
waitress:
No, thanks.

31:34.100 --> 31:34.900
I don't need anything.

31:39.500 --> 31:40.300
mind if i sit here?

31:41.500 --> 31:42.300
Please.

31:44.100 --> 31:44.900
Hotch:
Completely empty.

31:44.900 --> 31:45.700
She's not here.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.700
Well, he's obviously
been here before

31:47.700 --> 31:49.800
and left these
gifts for her.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.000
How romantic.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.600
His version of romance.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.400
What... are you
trying to say

31:54.400 --> 31:55.400
you think he keeps
coming back here

31:55.400 --> 31:56.500
because he's
in love with her?

31:56.500 --> 31:57.600
That's impossible.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.200
A sexual sadist
can't feel love.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.500
Hotch: Well, define love.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.600
Chemically, it involves
surging brain elements

32:02.600 --> 32:03.800
called monoamines,
dopamines,

32:03.800 --> 32:05.200
norepinephrine,
and serotonin.

32:05.200 --> 32:07.600
Love chemicals controlled
by phenethylamine,

32:07.600 --> 32:08.400
also found in...

32:08.400 --> 32:09.300
chocolate.

32:09.300 --> 32:10.300
I love chocolate.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.400
Peas, too! It's also
found in peas!

32:12.400 --> 32:13.200
Peas?
Reid?

32:13.200 --> 32:15.100
Indeed, some
veritable...
reid, stop.

32:15.100 --> 32:15.900
Please.

32:16.300 --> 32:17.800
Spread out, everybody.
Keep looking.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.600
Fbi!

33:04.200 --> 33:05.300
Clear.

33:13.100 --> 33:14.200
I thought i'd
seen everything.

33:18.000 --> 33:18.800
Guys.

33:19.000 --> 33:19.800
What is it?

33:20.200 --> 33:21.000
It's a coffin.

33:27.500 --> 33:28.300
Hotch,

33:28.500 --> 33:29.700
there's another
coffin over here.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.200
It's ok. Don't try to speak.

33:39.200 --> 33:39.900
We've got you.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.200
Thank god.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.300
Ahh.

33:49.300 --> 33:50.900
One is perfection.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.400
Two is decadent.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.900
You take another step,
and i will shoot you.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.000
No, you won't.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.300
Was it that jane
said to you?

33:58.600 --> 33:59.800
She looked
into your eyes.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.200
That wouldn't
have been enough.

34:01.500 --> 34:02.500
She said something.

34:03.000 --> 34:03.700
What?

34:04.200 --> 34:05.200
It's important.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.000
I'm a sexual sadist.

34:08.600 --> 34:09.900
I can't feel anything.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.199
Remember?

34:11.600 --> 34:12.300
You said so.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.400
Yeah, hotch?

34:14.600 --> 34:15.600
There are no absolutes

34:15.600 --> 34:17.199
when it comes to
the human mind.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.100
They just found
his trailer,

34:19.100 --> 34:20.300
the remains
of another woman

34:20.300 --> 34:21.500
and the sheriff alive.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.100
He doesn't care
about the sheriff.

34:23.699 --> 34:25.100
To walk out
of here with jane,

34:25.100 --> 34:26.000
he'd need more
than that.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.800
Frank: Jane said...

34:28.400 --> 34:30.000
how beautiful
my eyes were.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
I looked at her

34:33.000 --> 34:34.800
like i've never looked
at a woman before.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.300
My hands began to sweat.

34:40.300 --> 34:41.600
I dropped the knife.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.000
I tried to pick
it up, but...

34:45.600 --> 34:47.000
it fell again.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.900
I got butterflies
in my stomach.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.300
Isn't that love?

34:55.000 --> 34:56.300
??????//

34:56.600 --> 34:57.400
Gideon!

34:57.500 --> 34:58.800
Found george.
She's alive.

34:58.800 --> 34:59.600
Get on the floor!

34:59.600 --> 35:00.500
Take it easy!
No!

35:00.500 --> 35:01.300
Take it easy!

35:11.300 --> 35:12.400
Silo: What?!

35:13.000 --> 35:13.700
No.

35:14.700 --> 35:15.800
That's impossible.

35:17.300 --> 35:18.700
??????

35:42.400 --> 35:43.200
George?!

35:44.000 --> 35:45.100
George, baby?!

35:46.400 --> 35:47.200
You all right?!

35:47.200 --> 35:48.000
Ha!

35:48.700 --> 35:50.300
Thank god.
Thank god.

35:51.500 --> 35:53.600
He killed tommy's teacher.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.500
I saw it.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.300
Oh.
Annie.

35:57.600 --> 35:59.200
She was just 22.

36:02.100 --> 36:02.900
What's wrong?

36:04.500 --> 36:05.900
They found the school
bus abandoned

36:06.500 --> 36:07.500
just outside of town.

36:07.800 --> 36:09.500
Tommy's supposed to
be on that field trip.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.200
Where is he?
Safe. He's fine.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.100
He's with my mom.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.400
But that man,
he also killed
the school
bus driver.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.600
How?!

36:19.000 --> 36:20.300
We had the whole
town shut down.

36:20.300 --> 36:21.300
There was no way out.

36:21.600 --> 36:22.500
What was
the one vehicle

36:22.500 --> 36:23.500
we weren't
looking for?

36:24.000 --> 36:24.900
A school bus.

36:24.900 --> 36:26.600
Hotch: More importantly,
where are the children?

36:29.300 --> 36:31.000
Gideon: You have
the town's children.

36:31.700 --> 36:32.900
Just the little ones.

36:34.100 --> 36:35.600
You profiled me, jason.

36:36.600 --> 36:38.700
You know i have
no interest
in harming children.

36:39.400 --> 36:40.200
We will find them.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.000
We have
helicopters, dogs...

36:42.200 --> 36:44.800
the desert is over
25,000 square miles.

36:44.800 --> 36:45.900
Silo: You shut up!

36:46.300 --> 36:49.100
And what with
the rising coyote
population...

36:49.700 --> 36:50.500
derek: If it's jane
you're after,

36:50.500 --> 36:51.500
we don't have her.

36:51.900 --> 36:53.200
Yes, you do.

37:03.200 --> 37:04.700
Sir, i found her
walking the streets.

37:06.900 --> 37:09.900
Jane, he's been
coming back to
this town for years to see you.

37:10.500 --> 37:11.900
All those why?

37:12.500 --> 37:13.800
He says he's
in love with you.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.200
He's in love
with me? Why?!
That's what he says.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.700
He hides out in
your old barn,

37:19.700 --> 37:20.500
and he watches you,

37:20.500 --> 37:21.600
and when
he leaves,

37:21.800 --> 37:23.900
he leaves these
wind chimes as gifts.

37:24.100 --> 37:25.200
They're beautiful,
aren't they?

37:25.200 --> 37:26.200
They're not beautiful.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.100
They are the remains
of people he took,

37:29.100 --> 37:30.300
tortured, and killed.

37:30.600 --> 37:32.000
He is not an alien.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.700
You were abducted
by a serial killer.

37:34.900 --> 37:37.700
But he did come
for me, didn't he?

37:37.700 --> 37:40.100
Not george! He came
for me, didn't he?

37:40.100 --> 37:41.000
Hotch: That's what he says.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.300
You told me to run,

37:42.900 --> 37:43.900
but i didn't
want to run.

37:45.200 --> 37:46.400
I wanted to
see him again,

37:46.400 --> 37:48.000
to see his eyes
and see his face.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.100
And i don't know...

37:49.100 --> 37:52.000
somehow it just felt
like i was coming home.

37:54.100 --> 37:54.900
Jane!

37:56.200 --> 37:58.400
Oh!
He has
the children, jane!

37:59.000 --> 38:00.200
Silo: He has our children.

38:00.200 --> 38:01.200
And we will
find them.

38:01.200 --> 38:01.800
And if we don't,

38:01.800 --> 38:02.800
they'll die
of exposure!

38:03.700 --> 38:05.200
He hasn't got
tommy, george,

38:05.400 --> 38:06.200
but what if he did?

38:07.100 --> 38:07.800
Hand him over.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.500
Silo.
What choice
do we have?

38:09.500 --> 38:10.600
Not this one!

38:10.900 --> 38:11.900
Tell them, jason.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.700
Tell them i'm
not interested
in harming children.

38:15.300 --> 38:16.700
You've studied me
for years.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.100
Have i ever once
harmed a child?

38:20.500 --> 38:21.500
It does
nothing for me.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.900
Give me jane...

38:24.700 --> 38:26.200
and they'll have
their children back.

38:26.500 --> 38:27.700
Is she part
of this with you?

38:27.700 --> 38:28.700
George:
Look at her, rick.

38:28.700 --> 38:30.500
She's not
a part of anything.

38:30.500 --> 38:31.900
She's as much his
victim as you are.

38:32.600 --> 38:34.100
Frank: With jane in my life,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.100
i will never harm
another human being.

38:37.100 --> 38:38.000
Oh.

38:38.000 --> 38:39.500
Leave her alone!

38:39.700 --> 38:41.300
Derek: Hey! Don't
even think about it.

38:43.400 --> 38:44.800
Gideon: No matter
what you do to him,

38:45.000 --> 38:46.600
he will never give
you what you want.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.800
George: I'm
telling you, rick,

38:50.800 --> 38:52.000
they'll find
the children.

38:52.000 --> 38:52.800
Trust me.

38:53.300 --> 38:54.400
Take me with you, frank.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.600
Just you and me.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.000
And my jane?

39:00.300 --> 39:01.600
You'll take me to
where the kids are?

39:02.800 --> 39:03.700
Happily.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.800
I couldn't have that
on my conscience.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.500
Frank, voice-over: I will take
a vehicle of my choice.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.000
Jason will drive.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.700
Once i'm satisfied
no one is following,

39:24.700 --> 39:26.700
i will take jason to
where i have the children.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.500
He will then call.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.200
If anyone follows,

39:31.000 --> 39:33.000
the story will end in tears.

39:47.300 --> 39:49.400
I've been coming to see
you for so many years to...

39:50.000 --> 39:51.700
to try and make sense
of what i feel.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.800
Jason says i'm incapable
of feeling anything,

39:55.800 --> 39:57.500
but here i am.

39:58.700 --> 39:59.800
And i feel.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.600
Where will we go?

40:03.700 --> 40:05.100
Wherever we want.

40:11.200 --> 40:12.200
Stop the car.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.700
Gideon: What he's feeling
right now will pass,

40:28.900 --> 40:30.500
and when it does,
like all the others...

40:31.800 --> 40:32.900
he'll take your life,

40:33.800 --> 40:36.100
and then he
will really feel.

40:37.300 --> 40:38.600
Jane: I don't
believe he will.

40:38.800 --> 40:41.200
I don't believe
you know what
this feels like.

40:41.600 --> 40:42.400
Frank: If you did,

40:43.100 --> 40:44.300
you would not be here.

40:45.100 --> 40:46.900
You'd be with
the one you love.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.000
Where are the children?

40:53.900 --> 40:54.700
That way.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.200
Two miles.

40:59.500 --> 41:00.600
No deal.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.200
So you're just going
to stand here with me

41:03.400 --> 41:05.000
while the children
suffer exposure

41:05.000 --> 41:05.800
to the elements?

41:06.200 --> 41:07.300
It's gonna be
dark real soon.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.000
You are not the hero

41:10.000 --> 41:11.100
your parents
thought you'd be.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.600
I will never stop
hunting you.

41:16.100 --> 41:16.900
Not ever.

41:17.300 --> 41:19.100
Then i promise
the same thing.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.300
I will never
stop loving jane...

41:24.700 --> 41:26.000
until you catch me.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.600
You are insane.

41:29.200 --> 41:31.200
Love is insanity,
isn't it?

41:31.900 --> 41:33.300
Frank: Not
a good insanity.

41:35.700 --> 41:36.800
My hope is
that one day

41:36.800 --> 41:38.400
you'll feel
the way i do, too.

41:38.900 --> 41:41.200
If i ever find myself
feeling the way you do...

41:43.000 --> 41:44.300
i'll kill myself.

41:45.900 --> 41:46.900
Call me first.

41:47.700 --> 41:49.200
I'd love to pick
your brains.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.100
Emily: He told you
where they were?

42:42.700 --> 42:44.000
They were just
over that ridge.

42:48.000 --> 42:49.000
Which way did he go?

42:49.200 --> 42:50.100
West.

42:50.400 --> 42:51.500
Silo: All units,
all units,

42:51.500 --> 42:52.400
we have the children.
