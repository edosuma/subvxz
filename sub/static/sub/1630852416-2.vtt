WEBVTT

00:09.109 --> 00:12.612
You went to your pal's second
c.

00:12.645 --> 00:14.647
Ugh...

00:16.816 --> 00:18.718
- How're ya now?
- Good, 'n' you?

00:18.785 --> 00:20.553
- Not s'bad.
- I'm s'bad.

00:20.620 --> 00:22.055
What's the frequency, Kenneth?

00:22.122 --> 00:23.790
Have you ever been to Dan's
second cousin's house?

00:23.823 --> 00:25.291
- Who? Garrett?
- No. Jarrett.

00:25.325 --> 00:26.860
Oh, yeah.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.895
Yeah, I put a field car
in their back pond one time

00:28.962 --> 00:30.363
and have not been welcomed back.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.798
Oh, sure you are,
good buddies.

00:31.831 --> 00:33.800
Oh, I'm good, good buddy.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.368
And why would that be, Wayne?

00:35.402 --> 00:37.037
Because Dan's second cousins

00:37.070 --> 00:39.806
have the biggest hick house
I have ever seen.

00:39.839 --> 00:41.908
- Waynes!
- I can beat it.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.076
- No, you can't.
- Can, too.

00:43.143 --> 00:44.978
- Cannot.
- Can and will.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.579
Katy, is this because
we just came back

00:46.646 --> 00:48.214
from my second cousin's house
down the side road?

00:48.248 --> 00:50.483
Dary's second cousin's
house down the side road

00:50.517 --> 00:53.219
is the biggest hick house
I have ever seen.

00:53.253 --> 00:55.155
- Katy!
- Look, youse are familiar

00:55.188 --> 00:56.823
with our stance
on personal hygiene,

00:56.856 --> 00:59.659
so it should be no surprise
our stance on home hygiene.

00:59.692 --> 01:01.261
Sounds like you wanna
go head-to-head, Katy.

01:01.327 --> 01:02.662
I'm ready for a hick-off.

01:02.695 --> 01:03.930
You guys gonna hick-off
in front of each other,

01:03.997 --> 01:04.931
right here, right now?

01:04.998 --> 01:06.232
I hicked off earliers todays.

01:06.266 --> 01:07.934
Dan's second cousints

01:08.001 --> 01:10.003
have the biggest hick house
I've ever seen because...

01:10.036 --> 01:11.905
You said you were gonna grab us
,

01:11.938 --> 01:12.939
but you know, whatever.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.674
Dary's second cousints

01:14.707 --> 01:16.843
have the biggest hick house
I've ever seen because...

01:16.876 --> 01:18.344
Well, let's just make sure
nobody's feelings

01:18.378 --> 01:19.345
are gonna get hurt here.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.947
When you pull up the laneway,

01:21.014 --> 01:23.016
a llama comes trotting up to
your door the way a dog would.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.451
That's Cody.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.352
There's a Planned Parenthood
billboard on the property

01:26.386 --> 01:27.954
right beside another
billboard that says,

01:28.021 --> 01:29.856
"Smile, your mom chose life."

01:29.889 --> 01:31.591
I thought it was good
to stay bipartisan.

01:31.624 --> 01:33.359
There's a substantial
ring of blood

01:33.393 --> 01:35.929
in the bathroom
sink, shower and toilet.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.031
Okay, define substantials.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.300
There's two Jack Russell
terriers in the kitchen,

01:40.366 --> 01:42.368
standing side by side,
licking the wall.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.970
Yeah, they're Wire Haired
Jack Russells, though,

01:44.037 --> 01:45.271
I mean, if we're splittin'
hairs.

01:45.305 --> 01:47.207
There was a patch of
black ice inside the door

01:47.240 --> 01:49.642
that Dan's little cousints
were playing ball hockey on

01:49.709 --> 01:51.311
and one of 'em
sticked me in the face.

01:51.377 --> 01:53.379
Oh, that'd be Cody.
He's on the spectrums.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.648
Wait. The kid and the llama
are both named Cody?

01:55.715 --> 01:57.317
Well, Cody gots
to name the llamas, so...

01:57.383 --> 01:58.551
And then, there was a toddler,

01:58.585 --> 02:00.053
drinking a two-litre
of cream soda,

02:00.086 --> 02:01.387
wearing a onesie that said,

02:01.421 --> 02:03.623
"Sex instructor,
first lesson's free."

02:03.656 --> 02:05.725
That's Cody Jr.
That's Cody's boy.

02:05.758 --> 02:07.727
There was bird shit
on the carpet inside.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.329
You can't prove that
that's bird's shit.

02:09.395 --> 02:10.964
The floors are so slanted,

02:10.997 --> 02:13.233
Dan's cousints GT
from room to room.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.835
Now, that is a Brett Hull's
editions GTs racers,

02:15.902 --> 02:18.638
and I challenge any of youse to
find one of those nowadays.

02:18.671 --> 02:21.741
One of their living room chairs
.

02:21.774 --> 02:24.744
They call a bucket in
the c.

02:24.777 --> 02:27.480
There was a car parts titty
calendar on the fridge.

02:27.514 --> 02:30.083
Dan's uncle showed me
a nude photo of Dan's aunt

02:30.116 --> 02:31.518
that he keeps in his wallet.

02:31.584 --> 02:32.619
Aunt Nancys?

02:32.652 --> 02:34.587
They keep the
windows open all winter

02:34.621 --> 02:36.656
because the whole place just
smells like piss.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.091
Well, it may smell
like that to you, but--

02:38.124 --> 02:40.426
There's an impossible
amount of Subway wrappers...

02:40.460 --> 02:42.095
beside the toilet.

02:42.128 --> 02:44.097
Ew. You used the en suites?

02:44.130 --> 02:46.666
Dary's second cousint burned his
eyebrows off cooking meth.

02:46.699 --> 02:48.768
Yeah, that one won't be beat.

02:48.801 --> 02:51.337
Dan's uncle has too many
DUIs to drive truck,

02:51.371 --> 02:54.007
but still somehow
drives a school bus.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.975
Yeah, now,
that one won't be beats.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.848
I did see...

03:01.881 --> 03:04.551
what could only be
a glory hole.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.387
Katy, my aunt and uncle's sex
life is none of your beeswax.

03:07.453 --> 03:09.622
On the side of the goat pen.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.158
Oh!

03:13.493 --> 03:14.961
You win.

03:24.871 --> 03:26.906
Your second cousints
have the biggest hicks house

03:26.940 --> 03:29.108
One times, a bird flew into
your second cousints house

03:29.175 --> 03:32.278
and your aunt actually yelled
out, "What's in tarnation?!"

03:32.345 --> 03:33.613
Well, same thing
happened at yours

03:33.680 --> 03:35.348
and your aunt
yelled out, "Dinner!"

03:35.381 --> 03:37.283
- Big day.
- I should say.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.919
- Don't delay.
- Okay.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.688
Where's he goin'?

03:41.721 --> 03:44.123
Remember when Marie-Fred
showed up at the bar

03:44.190 --> 03:45.692
during the launch of NDN NRG?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.260
- No.
- Well, she did.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.262
Why didn't he
tell me about that?

03:49.295 --> 03:50.763
You don't airs
your dirty laundry.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.099
Yeah, give people something
to talk about and they will.

03:53.132 --> 03:54.434
Well, it's just rumours.

03:54.467 --> 03:56.102
And you know the small town
approach to rumours.

03:56.135 --> 03:57.637
Where there's
smoke there's fire.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.205
What did she want?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.974
There's a truck she's
been after for a while

04:01.040 --> 04:02.775
and found one at the
dealership in the city.

04:02.809 --> 04:04.277
Like here in the city?

04:04.310 --> 04:06.613
Can confirm.
English city. Not Quebec City.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.147
Great fishin's in kaw-becs.

04:08.214 --> 04:09.716
She asked Wayne to
help her with the sale

04:09.749 --> 04:11.718
'cause the English will take
liberties with the French.

04:11.751 --> 04:12.885
And vice versas.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.454
Why does he want to help her?

04:14.487 --> 04:17.056
- 'Cause we owe her one.
- Why?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.891
It rhymes with
"Shlong dick jerks."

04:18.925 --> 04:20.560
And you're fine with this?

04:20.593 --> 04:22.996
- Yep.
- And dandy?

04:23.062 --> 04:24.998
No reason not to trust him
till he gives me one, bud.

04:25.064 --> 04:27.734
Bought and paid for.
So, are you guys excited

04:27.767 --> 04:29.802
for the Caesar making
contest at MoDean's?

04:29.836 --> 04:31.571
Not much
of a contest, KatyKat.

04:31.604 --> 04:32.639
Andele.

04:32.672 --> 04:34.741
I'll packs
up the garnishes.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.410
It's just... you know,
guess I'm a wee bit miffed

04:37.443 --> 04:39.512
that Wayne didn't want me to
c.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.147
I dicker better than anybody.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.415
Nos, you don'ts.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.350
Who can dicker better than me?

04:44.417 --> 04:46.819
Good man.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.755
Ahh, McMurray!

04:48.788 --> 04:51.591
- Marie-Frédérique!
- No, no.

04:51.624 --> 04:52.692
How're ya now?

04:52.759 --> 04:54.761
- Not s'bad. Good, 'n you?

04:54.794 --> 04:56.596
- Good 'n you? Not so--
- Anyhoo...

04:56.629 --> 04:57.864
Thanks for the help.

04:57.930 --> 04:59.666
Don't wanna get my pants
pulled down, ya know?

04:59.699 --> 05:02.335
Oh, don't you worry your pretty
.

05:02.368 --> 05:05.171
Wayne knows me
better than anybody,

05:05.204 --> 05:07.173
and I know him
better than anybody,

05:07.206 --> 05:10.710
that's why he knows nobody
dickers better than me...

05:10.777 --> 05:12.278
'cause he knows me
better than anybody.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
Okay, well, that's...

05:13.346 --> 05:15.114
And I know him
better than anybody.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.283
- Bon.
- Wanna know what,

05:17.317 --> 05:18.885
I got a few quick questions
here 'bout the truck

05:18.951 --> 05:19.952
before we get
this rig rollin'.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.788
- Allons-y.
- What year is it?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.122
2017.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.124
- How many klicks?
- Short of 80,000.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.225
- V8?
- V6.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.627
That's better than a 4-banger.

05:27.660 --> 05:28.795
What's your mile to the gallon?

05:28.828 --> 05:30.463
- 16.
- Highway or city?

05:30.496 --> 05:32.632
16 city. 23 highway.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.233
- Ponies?
- 355.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.635
- Torque?
- I don't know.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.738
- Probably 'round 380.
- Well, 380, 383, yeah.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.573
- Ever been in an accident?
- Fender-bender.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.208
- You file a claim?
- No.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.844
- Warranty?
- Good through 100,000km.

05:48.481 --> 05:50.817
How long's the one you want
been on the lot?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.819
- Not a month.
- Dealer above board?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.921
Meh.
Likes to take swipes.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.428
- Sorted?
- Sorted.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.765
All good?

06:05.832 --> 06:07.233
All gravy.

06:07.266 --> 06:08.601
Jimmy Dickens.

06:11.003 --> 06:12.171
Dick-skin!

06:12.205 --> 06:13.673
Indeed.

06:13.706 --> 06:17.009
The Caesar building
competition may begin.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.012
Each team will
present their Caesars

06:20.046 --> 06:21.914
with a breakdown
of ingredients,

06:21.948 --> 06:24.183
and then, upon completion
of the presentation,

06:24.217 --> 06:26.352
spectators will be asked
to raise their hands

06:26.386 --> 06:29.021
if they so desire
the Caesar in question.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.957
From there, either
I or one of my...

06:32.725 --> 06:35.361
...merry, gregarious
auctioneer chums

06:35.395 --> 06:36.696
will tally the show of hands

06:36.729 --> 06:38.197
and compare
the grand totals,

06:38.231 --> 06:40.800
team by team,
come competitions end.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.535
Now, let's meet the judges.

06:42.568 --> 06:44.804
Startin' with this
dog with two tails.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.476
Now, this
cushion-hearted,

06:50.543 --> 06:54.380
beguiling guy
comes from out Hanover way

06:54.414 --> 06:57.316
and remains proficient in
the auctioneering practice

06:57.383 --> 06:59.218
well into year ten
as a professional.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.554
It's Charlie "Cue Ball"
Lawless, everybody.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.958
Now, how about this
barrel of monkeys?

07:07.226 --> 07:08.795
Barrel--
the whole barrel!

07:10.396 --> 07:11.831
Now, this
frolicsome fella

07:11.898 --> 07:14.066
is full of all
the joys of spring.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.636
Coming to us this afternoon
from out Seaforth way,

07:16.669 --> 07:19.305
and full of vim and vinegar...

07:19.338 --> 07:23.476
...it's Derek "Broadway"
Olson, everybody.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.246
From here, I'll hand
the floor over

07:27.280 --> 07:28.748
to your master
of ceremonies -

07:28.781 --> 07:30.416
Miss Bonnie McMurray!

07:34.620 --> 07:37.089

07:38.925 --> 07:40.493
with a maximum
of three boosters

07:40.526 --> 07:42.428
and a maximum of
three garnishes.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.030
Group at the end
with the most hands up

07:44.096 --> 07:46.599
after their presentation
drinks free tonight. Yup?

07:46.632 --> 07:48.167
Yup.
- Super.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.770
My understudy will be
taking over from here.

07:50.803 --> 07:52.672
- Your understudy?
- I don't work tonight.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.207
And I want that free booze.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.608
Here we go, Bonno.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.844
Saddle up, lady.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.946
Who is your
understudy, buddy?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.216
♪ Partir, venir ♪

08:03.282 --> 08:06.219

08:06.285 --> 08:10.556

Eh! You know where the punch
clock is and everything?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.303
Bonnie showed me.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.138
- 'Kay.
- Hi, Daryl.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.640
Oui, allo.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.308
I'm looking after
my grand-mère in Galway

08:29.342 --> 08:30.910
while my grand-père
has an operation.

08:30.977 --> 08:32.812
Figured I'd pick up some
shifts while I'm here.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.547
That's... fine.

08:34.580 --> 08:35.815
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:35.848 --> 08:37.917
your new master
of ceremonies,

08:37.984 --> 08:39.819
your new commander-in--

08:39.852 --> 08:42.722
Mandarin?
Who's Mandarin?

08:42.755 --> 08:44.056
If she cheats...

08:44.090 --> 08:46.425
- It's over.
- No exceptions.

08:46.492 --> 08:48.327
I know.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.730
Fuck, does she look good.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.508
Your commander-in chief -
Anik!

09:05.678 --> 09:07.947
Hicks up first.

09:09.215 --> 09:12.251
- Base?
- 100% Clamato juice.

09:12.285 --> 09:14.253
Traditional Canadian approach.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.622
- Booze?
- Vodka, three ounces.

09:16.689 --> 09:19.859
Two is the norm, but three's
appreciated. Rimmer?

09:19.892 --> 09:21.861
- Hardly knew 'er.
- Dary...

09:21.894 --> 09:23.429
Wets the rims
with lemon juice

09:23.462 --> 09:25.131
and then dust it
with celery salts

09:25.197 --> 09:26.465
and Montreal steak spice.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.468
We could have a contender
here. Boosters?

09:29.535 --> 09:32.104
Dash of Tabasco,
dash of Worcestershire,

09:32.138 --> 09:33.873
shot of pickle juice.

09:33.906 --> 09:36.709
I won't stop you now.
Garnishes?

09:36.742 --> 09:38.878
Stick of celery,
dill pickle...

09:38.911 --> 09:40.780
Ands a Slim Jims.

09:40.813 --> 09:44.150
-
- Hey, I know a Slim Jim!

09:46.752 --> 09:48.220
You're up, Dickens.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.324
Take it away,
Cue Ball Lawless!

09:51.390 --> 09:53.626
Okay, hands up
in the air!

09:53.659 --> 09:55.294
We got two now,
we got five now,

09:55.328 --> 09:56.562
seven, now 10,
12 now, 15.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.230
- We got 15!
15!

09:58.264 --> 10:00.333
Where's his office?

10:00.399 --> 10:01.734
Oh, it's actually...

10:01.767 --> 10:04.637
Marie-Frédérique.
Bonjour.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.238
Hello, Lisa.
How are you?

10:06.272 --> 10:09.475
I'm perfect. Bring me
a couple bluebirds?

10:09.508 --> 10:11.344
- Pardon?
- Bluebirds.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.312
Unexpected sales
opportunities.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.581
Just a little
dealer humour.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.850
Are they extra hands to help
you catch your white whale?

10:17.917 --> 10:19.251
White whale?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.753
It's an expression,

10:20.786 --> 10:23.756
derived from Herman Melville's
classic novel Moby Dick.

10:23.789 --> 10:26.158
Ahab, captain of
the whaling ship Pequod,

10:26.192 --> 10:27.526
chased and chased
and chased Moby Dick,

10:27.593 --> 10:30.029
his white whale,
but never caught it.

10:30.096 --> 10:31.931
So, to say something
is your white whale

10:31.964 --> 10:33.499
is to say it's something

10:33.532 --> 10:36.002
that you chase and chase
and chase and never get.

10:36.035 --> 10:37.937
See, this is why
I've brought my--

10:37.970 --> 10:39.772
- Cousints.
- Yeah.

10:39.805 --> 10:42.608
For when English goes
over my head. You know?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.710
I see. I'm Lisa.

10:44.777 --> 10:45.778
McMurray.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.114
Nice to meet you.
I'm Lisa.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.115
I'm Wayne.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.050
Nice to meet you.

10:51.117 --> 10:53.452
You know, you
really should have

10:53.486 --> 10:55.121
just taken the
truck home with you.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.723
You still can. I insist.

10:57.790 --> 10:59.191
I don't want to
risk an accident.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.294
I trust myself on the road.
Don't trust others.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.729
Who can blame you?

11:03.796 --> 11:06.132
No one loves drunk driving
like the French.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.134
So, let's make
sure this truck

11:08.167 --> 11:10.136
doesn't become
Marie-Fred's white whale.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.237
There's only one.

11:11.303 --> 11:14.040
There are plenty
of white whales.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.074
I'm sorry?

11:15.141 --> 11:17.810
They're called belugas.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.179
Uh-huh.
Charlotte?

11:23.416 --> 11:24.917
Decision-maker's niece;

11:24.984 --> 11:26.318
she wants her to learn
from the best.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.387
Charlotte, can you
escort Marie-Fred,

11:28.421 --> 11:30.923
Wayne and McMarshall
to my office.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.224
Coffee? Water?

11:32.258 --> 11:33.559
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you.

11:33.592 --> 11:36.328
I'll have a water.

11:36.362 --> 11:39.665
Charlotte, can you grab
that for Mr. McMorris?

11:39.699 --> 11:41.333
Thank you.

11:41.367 --> 11:42.735
You're welcome.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.603
- Merci.
- Avec plaisir.

11:45.604 --> 11:46.672
Okay.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.341
I have to go
to the back quickly,

11:49.375 --> 11:52.044
but I will be...
right with you.

11:54.613 --> 11:55.681
She's 'macmirn'.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.083
She's what?

11:57.116 --> 11:58.350
Mirroring.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.685
That's what I said
- 'macmirn'.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.253
Did you notice when I
put my hands on my hips,

12:01.287 --> 12:02.855
she put her hands
on her hips?

12:02.888 --> 12:05.257
When I crossed my arms,
she crossed her arms?

12:05.291 --> 12:06.959
That's called 'macmirn' -

12:07.026 --> 12:08.527
building a rapport with
a potential buyer

12:08.561 --> 12:10.429
by adopting
their body language.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.298
She's trying to make me
feel like I'm hanging

12:12.364 --> 12:14.133
with an old field
hockey pal.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.601
You played field hockey?

12:15.634 --> 12:17.970
She tried to get you with
the puppy dog close, too.

12:18.037 --> 12:19.371
- Ehh?
- Well, it's when the dealer

12:19.405 --> 12:21.140
lets you take the truck
home for a while,

12:21.207 --> 12:23.275
drive it around, hopes you
fall in love with it.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.478
It's kind of like dropping a
puppy off at someone's door.

12:25.544 --> 12:26.712
Ah, je comprends.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.047
Well, all right!

12:28.080 --> 12:29.715
If there's a feature
on the truck you don't want,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.917
you're prepared
to say, like...

12:33.586 --> 12:35.121
"I'm not paying for that."

12:35.154 --> 12:36.956
- Ouais.
- Super.

12:36.989 --> 12:39.258
Personally, I'm worried
about this dealer.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.729
But there sure is
an awful lot

12:43.763 --> 12:46.499
of nice snatch
around here, though.

12:46.565 --> 12:49.068
Your second cousints thinks
Wonder Breads

12:49.101 --> 12:50.302
is a foods group.

12:50.336 --> 12:51.570
Did you say
they're inbred?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.738
Yeah, they're
that's, too.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.140
Reilly and Jonesy.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.407
Has anyone
dibs'd you yet?

12:55.441 --> 12:57.309
- Base.
- Okay, we'll circle back.

12:59.411 --> 13:03.916
Half Clamato juice,
half tomato juice.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.918
Otherwise known as a
Clamato Bloody Mary.

13:05.951 --> 13:07.987
Actually, buddy,
I think I believe

13:08.020 --> 13:11.357
it's half to-ma-to
and half Cla-ma-to.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.758
- Is it?
- Booze?

13:12.792 --> 13:14.527
Three ounces of vodka.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.929
Seeing some welcome
consistency in that category.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.930
Rimmer?

13:17.963 --> 13:19.532
Wet the rim with
some lime juice,

13:19.598 --> 13:21.000
and then dust it
with some celery salt

13:21.033 --> 13:22.368
and Montreal
chicken spice.

13:22.434 --> 13:24.170
- Assaisonnement?
- Excuse-a-me?

13:24.203 --> 13:26.272
Seasoning. Boosters.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.873
- Ah, of course.
- Yeah.

13:27.940 --> 13:29.608
Frank's Red Hot sauce,

13:29.642 --> 13:32.678
ten dashes of
Worcester-sha-sire sauce.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.180
Now, it's a muddy Caesar.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.616
And, of course, a shot
of dill 'plickler' juice.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.552
- Garnishes?
- Of course.

13:39.618 --> 13:43.389
One dill 'plickler',
one 'plickled' pepper.

13:43.455 --> 13:46.458
And one 'plickled' egg.
Protein, boys.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.794
Hey...

13:58.404 --> 13:59.805
Jim Dickens?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.041
The stage is yours,
Broadway Olson!

14:02.074 --> 14:05.144
Okay, folks, lookin'
for hands for Caesars.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.879
How many hands I got?
One now.

14:06.912 --> 14:08.214
Two, looking for two.
Now three.

14:08.247 --> 14:09.648
Three. Now, five. Five.
Lookin' for five.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.250
I got five.
Lookin' five.

14:11.317 --> 14:12.384
Lookin' for seven now,
seven now. Eight now.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.586
Nine now. Ten.
Lookin for ten. Ten?

14:13.652 --> 14:14.920
What about ten?

14:14.987 --> 14:18.090
Would you look at that.
She has a picture

14:18.157 --> 14:21.327
of her softball team for
her computer wallpaper.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.163
Tells me an awful lot.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.899
Why? What's on your
computer wallpaper?

14:26.932 --> 14:28.834
- The wife.
- And you?

14:28.868 --> 14:29.935
The dog.

14:30.002 --> 14:34.440
Yep. That is no
family man, I tell ya.

14:34.506 --> 14:36.208
Woman.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.179
I see you've
met the ladies.

14:40.212 --> 14:42.348
Mm-hmm.
Youse any good?

14:42.381 --> 14:44.583
Why play
if you can't win?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.685
- Have a seat.
- You gonna sit?

14:46.719 --> 14:47.753
I sit all day.

14:47.786 --> 14:49.355
- I'll stand too.
- Why?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.590
Because sitting is
quietly murdering you.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.926
Mm-hmm. Let's get
right to it.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.861
Good patio weather
out there.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.697
We wrap this up, we
can engage in some NSAs.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.532
Non sales
related activities.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.968
If I'm reading your buying
signals correctly,

15:03.035 --> 15:04.103
you're no tire kicker.

15:04.136 --> 15:05.704
Person with no ability
to buy.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.539
I'm not here to make
an emotional sale.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.875
Generate excitement
around the product.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.377
I've analyzed
your BANT.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.213
budget, authority, need,
timeline.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.148
And with any luck, I will
be taking something

15:16.215 --> 15:18.717
significant to
the decision-maker.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.653
She is the
gate-keeper of the deal,

15:20.719 --> 15:23.055
but her boss
is the decision-maker.

15:23.088 --> 15:25.724
Now, what can I do to
earn your business today?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.459
Youse got a hard copy
of the FAB?

15:27.493 --> 15:28.994
"Features, advantages,
and benefits."

15:29.061 --> 15:31.230
Of course I do, McMorris.
Charlotte!

15:31.263 --> 15:32.998
I've got mine.
Alright,

15:33.065 --> 15:35.000
so the truck comes with a
full-length moonroof, eh?

15:35.067 --> 15:36.402
Marie-Fred, you ever
had a moonroof.

15:36.435 --> 15:37.836
- No.
- Any desire for one?

15:37.903 --> 15:40.072
It's nice, but I'm fine
with a sunroof.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.141
Alright, so, the truck comes
with a full-length moonroof

15:42.174 --> 15:43.409
and we're just fine with
the standard

15:43.442 --> 15:45.911
factory sun roof,
so, like...

15:45.945 --> 15:47.513
(Deep voice:) So, I'm not
paying for that.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.148
Let's talk
intellectual sale.

15:49.181 --> 15:50.916
Intellectual sale
appeals to logic

15:50.950 --> 15:52.584
for quick solutions
to a problem.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.852
Correct, McMansplain.

15:53.919 --> 15:55.521
Wanna know what, gets
pretty cold in Q-bec.

15:55.587 --> 15:57.656
Colder than
here, actually.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.658
What say you throw
in a remote starter

15:59.692 --> 16:01.527
to help warm up the truck
in the winter months

16:01.593 --> 16:03.929
and, uh, I'll forget
about the added cost

16:03.963 --> 16:05.164
of full-length
the moonroof.

16:05.197 --> 16:06.532
I can do that.

16:06.598 --> 16:09.034
We reaching the bottom
of the sales funnel?

16:09.101 --> 16:10.936
Fancy way of saying,
"Are we close to a deal?"

16:10.970 --> 16:12.171
Alright, so,
the truck comes with

16:12.204 --> 16:14.273
a tri-fold soft
tonneau cover, eh?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.108
- Out of the box.
- You wanna know what?

16:16.141 --> 16:19.278
You're not paying
for that?

16:19.311 --> 16:20.679
Marie-Fred,
your last truck's

16:20.713 --> 16:22.114
got a tri-fold hard
tonneau cover, eh?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.382
Ouais.

16:23.449 --> 16:25.050
What's say we get one
of those out of the box.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.052
Oui?

16:27.119 --> 16:28.620
I mean, yes?

16:28.654 --> 16:29.722
Never mind.

16:30.789 --> 16:33.025
Actually!

16:33.058 --> 16:34.793
Go see the decision-maker
in her office,

16:34.827 --> 16:36.895
tell her I'll be
coming soon.

16:36.962 --> 16:38.297
Okay.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.399
On second thought,
I'll just do that myself.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.168
I will be right back.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.077
I would love to have
a bath with that gal.

16:52.144 --> 16:54.713
Your second cousints garage
has four skidoos in it,

16:54.747 --> 16:56.749
nones of which
is operationals,

16:56.815 --> 16:59.385
yet they parks the cars
on the front lawns.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.320
Your second cousints
keep a bottle of Windex

17:01.353 --> 17:03.255
in the liquor cabinet
for making, quote,

17:03.322 --> 17:05.257
"Regina martinis."

17:05.324 --> 17:06.925
Skids.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.260
Dibs.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.397
Wait! If by asking if
she's been dibs'd,

17:11.430 --> 17:13.665
is that not technically
already dibsing?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.667
- No.
- Anyhoo...

17:15.701 --> 17:16.735
Base?

17:16.769 --> 17:20.105
Half Clamato,
half V...8.

17:20.172 --> 17:22.941
Added nutrition.
Uncharacteristic approach.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.910
Booze?

17:24.943 --> 17:27.579
Three ounces of gin,
Beefeater.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.749
Gin Caesar - very
popular with the British.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.684
Y' Peaky Blinders,

17:32.718 --> 17:34.019
bruv innit?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.188
Innit?
Matthew Crawley?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.090
- Rimmer?
- Wet...

17:38.123 --> 17:39.625
the rim with soya sauce

17:39.691 --> 17:42.961
and dust it with celery
salt and lemon pepper.

17:43.028 --> 17:46.265
Breaking new ground
here. Boosters?

17:46.298 --> 17:48.467
Horseradish,
lemon juice...

17:48.534 --> 17:51.437
Macarico piri-piri sauce.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.039
I'm intrigued.
Garnishes?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.608
One Baffin Island
jumbo cocktail shrimp.

17:56.642 --> 17:57.810
Ooh!

17:57.876 --> 18:00.312
One Salt Spring Island
Dungeness crab leg.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.217
And one Prince Edward Island
Malpeque Oyster!

18:07.486 --> 18:08.787
Yeah!

18:11.390 --> 18:12.458
Jimmy Dickens?

18:12.491 --> 18:13.892
Yes, ma'am.
Tally-ho!

18:13.926 --> 18:16.228
Tally those bananas,
here we go.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.064
Alright, now, we're looking at
how many hands in the air?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.799
We got one hand right here.
We like one, two. Two.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.668
We got four over here.
Lookin' at five. Five. Five.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.336
Lookin' at six. Six.
In the bathroom over there,

18:24.403 --> 18:25.904
seein' one over
there in the bathroom.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.973
Lookin' at urinals over there,
we got two in the urinals.

18:28.006 --> 18:29.241
Minus two in the urinals--

18:29.274 --> 18:32.344
15 over here,
if we count Linda. 15.

18:32.411 --> 18:34.513
Well, Liza...

18:34.580 --> 18:36.248
I think we've done
all the dickering we can

18:36.281 --> 18:37.916
on the fine points here.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.585
I think
you're right, McMartin.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.487
- What's your price?
- The one on the sticker.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.755
- 32,5?
- As I recall.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.090
29,5.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.358
I hope you don't think

18:46.425 --> 18:47.826
I'm gonna meet you
in the middle here.

18:47.860 --> 18:49.261
- Out the door.
- Out the door?

18:49.294 --> 18:51.597
- Out the door.
- 29,5 out the door?

18:51.630 --> 18:54.099
29,5 out the door.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.768
I do like
that sticker price.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.537
Well, there is an awful
lotta wear and tear

18:58.604 --> 19:00.005
on a gal
over 80,000 klicks.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.107
Good thing it's not
quite at 80,000 klicks.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.009
But it is almost
at 80,000 klicks.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.844
Good thing it's covered
under warranty

19:05.878 --> 19:07.546
through 100,000 klicks.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.715
- 30 out the door.
- 32 out the door.

19:09.781 --> 19:11.450
Oh, come now,
youse knows and I knows

19:11.483 --> 19:13.452
that you got it
at auction for low 20s.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.521
I got it on a trade in
and I overpaid.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.022
Not our problem.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.624
If it's my problem,
it's your problem.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.126
- 30 out the door.
- 32 out the door.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.461
I'm holding firm at 30.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.465
I'm sorry I couldn't
earn your business today.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.533
Charlotte!

19:27.566 --> 19:29.134
Cash deal.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.969
- Cash?
- Cash.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.038
Why didn't you say so?

19:33.071 --> 19:34.239
I thought you'd ask.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.475
If it's cash, I'll
do 30 out the door.

19:36.508 --> 19:39.478
- 29,5 out the door.
- 30 out the door,

19:39.511 --> 19:41.146
and I'll go see the
decision-maker right now.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.881
29,5 out the door

19:42.915 --> 19:46.084
and I'll go see the
decision-maker right now.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.654
LISA
Who can blame you?

19:48.687 --> 19:50.656
No one loves drunk driving
like the French.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.824
Hmm.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.928
You didn't think I'd let
that one go, did you?

19:55.994 --> 19:58.497
Maybe the decision-maker
agrees with me.

19:58.530 --> 20:02.000
Your assistant's been slipping
into her French all day.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.236
Clearly a
Québécois accent.

20:04.269 --> 20:06.438
If she's the
decision-maker's niece,

20:06.505 --> 20:10.676
the decision-maker most likely
h.

20:10.709 --> 20:14.913
Charlotte! Ta tante
parle français, hein?

20:14.947 --> 20:15.948
Deal.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.519
29,5.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.621
Didn't need
you here, McMerkley.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.623
Charlotte!

20:27.025 --> 20:28.860
You know, I wasn't sure

20:28.894 --> 20:31.129
until she leaned
on her desk there,

20:31.196 --> 20:34.933
but that woman is
not wearing a bra.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.702
Your second cousint

20:36.735 --> 20:38.437
switched to paper straws
for hoovering schneef

20:38.470 --> 20:39.805
and referred to it as
"going green."

20:39.871 --> 20:41.640
I didn't actually
wants to bring this up

20:41.707 --> 20:43.475
because it upsets
me so much,

20:43.542 --> 20:46.278
but it was clear, from
the residues on the case,

20:46.311 --> 20:47.879
that your second
cousints been using

20:47.913 --> 20:49.281
my favourite
Canadian albums

20:49.314 --> 20:51.216
for hoovering
schneefs off of.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.218
- Which one?
- Chantal Kreviazuk.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.054
"Surrounded"
is a generational song!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.723
Ooh...

20:57.756 --> 21:00.559
That is the finest looking
Caesar I've seen in a minute.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.060
Base.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.795
100% Clamato juice.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.398
Keeping it Canadian.
Booze?

21:06.431 --> 21:10.636
2.5 ounces vodka,
0.5 ounces moonshine.

21:10.669 --> 21:12.237
Ooh...

21:12.271 --> 21:14.506
Bold. Rimmer?

21:14.573 --> 21:16.408
Wet rim with
Louisiana Hot Sauce.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.810
Dust it with Old Bay
Seasoning and Cajun spice.

21:18.844 --> 21:21.647
My oh my.
Boosters?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.482
Slappy Mama
Hot Sauce.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.583
'Kay.

21:24.616 --> 21:25.984
Spicy horseradish.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.921
And you gotta have that
spic.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.423
Ooh!
- Yes.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.260
We may have a new
fan favourite here.

21:35.294 --> 21:38.096
And finally...
garnishes.

21:38.130 --> 21:41.166
Jalapeno stuffed olives,

21:41.199 --> 21:43.502
and a spicy
dill pickle, and...

21:43.535 --> 21:47.773
A slab of black pepper
habanero beef jerky.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.345
I really like
beef jerky.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.780
That's every hand up.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.181
We've got
a winner, everybody.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.384
You're drinkin'
free tonight, Bonno.

21:59.451 --> 22:02.220
Hold it now.
Hey now.

22:02.287 --> 22:05.123
Final tally is not
yet official now.

22:05.157 --> 22:06.525
Go on now.

22:06.558 --> 22:07.626
Cue Ball Lawless,

22:07.659 --> 22:08.894
how many hands up
are up currently?

22:08.960 --> 22:11.063
- Looks like about 15!
- 15!

22:11.129 --> 22:12.698
(Mumbling:) How many hands
up were up

22:12.731 --> 22:14.132
when you tallied
the hicks?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.233
- 15!
- 15!

22:15.300 --> 22:17.469
And Broadway Olson,
how many hands up

22:17.502 --> 22:19.304
were up when you tallied
the hockey players?

22:19.338 --> 22:20.639
- 15.
- 15.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.809
Skids total tally
also tallied 15,

22:23.842 --> 22:25.977
making this
a 4-way tie -

22:26.011 --> 22:28.914
15, 15, 15, 15.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.649
Well, everybody
loves a Caesar, boys.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.484
Can't see a Caesar
and not want a seize 'er.

22:32.517 --> 22:33.985
That's actually
how they market Caesars.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.822
Everyone gets
a free Caesar.

23:15.861 --> 23:17.362
♪ Take all of the time ♪

23:17.396 --> 23:19.831

23:21.967 --> 23:23.602
I saw my second cousint

23:23.635 --> 23:24.803

with a dart.

23:24.870 --> 23:26.104
No.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.039
It's a true story.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.775
I once saw
my second cousint

23:29.808 --> 23:32.043
rim his Caesars
with MsDMAs.

23:32.077 --> 23:34.746
- No.
- True stories.

23:38.250 --> 23:40.552
Oh, yeah?
Well, my second cousint

23:40.585 --> 23:42.220
says the Leafs
win the true cup

23:42.254 --> 23:43.989
every year they don't have
a Russian on the team.

23:44.055 --> 23:47.225
Oh, yeah? My aunts joined us

23:47.259 --> 23:49.461

Well, my second cousint's

23:54.599 --> 23:56.635

Oh, yeah?
My second cousint's

24:10.282 --> 24:11.983
I'm pert' near positive,

24:12.017 --> 24:13.685
the smell

24:13.752 --> 24:15.420
has attached itself
to the upholstery.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.688
Mm.

24:18.957 --> 24:21.359
- Thanks for checking in.
- You're welcome.

24:21.426 --> 24:23.428
You alright?

24:23.462 --> 24:26.598
